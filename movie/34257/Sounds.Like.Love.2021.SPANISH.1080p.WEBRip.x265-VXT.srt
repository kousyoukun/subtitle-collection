00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,416
NETFLIX PRESENTS

2
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:24,083
My name is Maca.

3
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:25,833
I'm 29 years old.

4
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:29,041
I've been a loser for 28 of those years,
but I'm evolving.

5
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:30,666
I am becoming a--

6
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,125
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

7
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:34,583
…a bad bitch.

8
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:56,625
-No more! No more!
-Adriana.

9
00:00:56,708 --> 00:01:00,208
-You're kidding. All three or nothing.
-It looks great. What's the matter?

10
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:03,166
It looks like two big tits.

11
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:05,916
Eh. More like two little tits.

12
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:09,208
Look. I've never been able to handle pain,
to be honest.

13
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:13,083
Nothing… nothing hurts as much as when
you feel weak, when really you're not.

14
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,000
Fine.

15
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:25,291
Okay. Here goes…

16
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:28,500
I believe… I believe in love
more than anything.

17
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:32,625
In Julián, I believe
in the family record book,

18
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:35,000
I believe in Sunday lunches
with my mother-in-law,

19
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:39,083
I believe in wedding anniversaries,
and I really believe in our mortgage.

20
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:41,875
Oh.

21
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:45,583
Probably not
the right time to argue.

22
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:48,583
Adriana knows what I think
about the state of her marriage.

23
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:53,250
-You like that?
-I love it.

24
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,791
Let me do you.

25
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:56,791
No, no. You can cum. Go ahead.

26
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:01,333
She's trying to convince us
that she might be asexual.

27
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:06,625
You don't have to settle for this
just because one day you said, "I do."

28
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:13,458
I keep telling her
that there's no way she's asexual.

29
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:16,375
Is it true
that in some parts of Papua New Guinea

30
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:19,166
that tattoos are sometimes used
to invoke the dead?

31
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,416
Jimena was dating Santi

32
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,416
when he crossed the street
without looking,

33
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,750
which happened 11 years ago.

34
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,791
I have to choose between
the one with three cameras

35
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:30,083
or the one with the awesome memory.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,041
What do you think?

37
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,250
Since then,
she's been obsessed with Nesquik

38
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,333
and finding a way to see him again.

39
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:40,250
Her last attempt arrived from Indonesia.
Reincarnation powder.

40
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:44,166
Santi's spirit is around the corner
for only $200 plus shipping.

41
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:49,166
Jime is certain that Santi will appear
in the flesh sooner or later.

42
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,000
So she looks for him
wherever the flesh is.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,958
They always do or say something
Santi would never have said.

44
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,625
So inevitably, she starts over again.

45
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,000
And of course, I'm not perfect.

46
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,875
I wish I were more self-confident,
stronger,

47
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:08,041
and could ignore what others think of me.

48
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:09,833
But I'm on it.

49
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,708
It's been denied.

50
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,000
-Bummer.
-As usual.

51
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:21,125
Well, it just means you're empowered.

52
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,458
Who needs more? He's gorgeous to me.

53
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,208
We meet once a week.

54
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:35,833
No movie, no shopping, no dinners,
or any of that shit.

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,833
Thanks to that, I have free time
to mind my own business.

56
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:43,375
Being in a committed relationship
is a mental black hole.

57
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,708
It pulls you off-track.

58
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,875
I date me and I fuck him.

59
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,375
I used to be naive about all this…

60
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,000
but not now.

61
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,875
♪ I turned 'round

62
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,625
-Turn it off.
-What?

63
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,208
-Dammit! Turn it off.
-What?

64
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,708
Quick! Turn it off before--

65
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,791
What the fuck was that?

66
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,666
I said I'm working on it. Okay?

67
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,666
Why the hell
am I always talking about men?

68
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,750
Let's talk about me.

69
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,250
Oh. Watch out!
Matcha can't get mixed with soy.

70
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,458
Oh my God.

71
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:06,625
Good morning.

72
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:10,625
I just published the picture
I edited yesterday with #AdoptDontBuy.

73
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,500
-Mm-hmm.
-I managed to get Andrés Sardá

74
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:15,166
to dress you for the ceremony
and Odyssey to do the makeup.

75
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,500
-Mmm?
-And I'm still writing your speech.

76
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,458
So as soon as I finish it,
I'll get it to you--

77
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:20,958
Maca, what's going on?

78
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,000
It's your tea.

79
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,125
I left you a voicemail.
I already said this to you.

80
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,041
A voicemail?

81
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,958
Yes, darling. A voicemail.

82
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,000
At four in the morning.

83
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:36,250
I've changed my diet.
I won't be eating for 20 hours a day.

84
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,916
What? Women in Calcutta
have been doing it for centuries,

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,250
and they look stupendous.

86
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:45,250
I'm pretty sure they don't make a choice
about their fasting, though.

87
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:46,208
I don't get it.

88
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,958
Nothing. I'm happy to drink it.

89
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,458
If you don't mind,
I don't want any temptations nearby.

90
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:54,875
Okay? And so in my presence you'll
have to pretend you're fasting as well.

91
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,041
Supportive fasting.

92
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,875
And, Maca, I'd rather you wear high heels.
You know that.

93
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,791
Sometimes you just drive me crazy.

94
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,125
I don't wear heels
because I don't want to get blisters

95
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:12,750
for someone who pays in pennies,
who makes me work weekends,

96
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,208
and who will now even starve me to death.

97
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,333
Please just show me
some respect.

98
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,208
Let's talk about the ulcer
I'll end up with

99
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,541
for not daring to speak my mind to Pipa,

100
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,000
my oppressive and insufferable boss.

101
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:34,000
But slaves aren't supposed to complain,
and that's essentially what I am to her.

102
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:37,541
I started working for Pipa
a year and a half ago,

103
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,083
when I didn't believe in myself at all.

104
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,250
To be fair, she never lied to me.

105
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,500
You do everything,
but won't get credit from me.

106
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,791
Pictures, texts, you tie my shoelaces.

107
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,833
I'll pay you almost nothing.
I'm very demanding.

108
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,541
And I'll make you cry.

109
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:57,583
But it won't be my fault.
I've been diagnosed a psychopath.

110
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:02,458
So, about your feelings…
Well, why would they matter to me?

111
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:07,833
Absolutely.

112
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:18,125
Pipa is number nine
in the national ranking of influencers.

113
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,625
She's gone up 12 positions this year.

114
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,500
Pipa!

115
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:26,041
She thinks it's because
of the new vintage filter.

116
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:29,416
However, I think she's kidding herself.

117
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,375
Pipa! Right here.

118
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:51,708
And in the category of
Most Inspirational Influencer, the winner…

119
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,958
is Pipa!

120
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,666
Oh. Thank you so much.

121
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,833
Thank you so much.

122
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,791
I'm a little bit nervous.

123
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,375
One little post can be a message…

124
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,333
-Thousands of people.
-…for thousands of people.

125
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,750
We have the responsibility
and the beautiful duty

126
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,125
to make a difference.

127
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,083
It's the art of communication.

128
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,625
Thanks to each and every one
of my followers

129
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,583
and all of you that are here today.

130
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,250
Honestly, thank you so much.

131
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:36,166
And I…

132
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:41,000
I could have never won
this very special award if not for…

133
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:47,291
…my boost-up serum,
Magic Fresh Light by Ophalo.

134
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:50,083
It's €25 in department stores now.

135
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,875
Thank you! Whoo!

136
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,750
Aah!

137
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:04,541
Oh.

138
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,250
Oh my God.

139
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:17,458
Hello?

140
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,750
Hello? Is there anyone out there
with a tampon?

141
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,291
Yes. I've got something better.

142
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,250
I always carry one of these
to give away.

143
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,583
Try it. You'll love it. You'll see.

144
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,333
I've been trying to use the cup
for the last four months,

145
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,500
but I can't seem
to figure out which way it goes.

146
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,958
These are my own brand,
and they're so easy to use.

147
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,625
-Raquel?
-Yes?

148
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,833
Raquel, it's Maca.

149
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,250
Maca. Gorgeous girl.

150
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,750
Of course. I saw Pipa,
and I thought about you.

151
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,000
I'll tell you how to use the cup.

152
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,333
Grab it by the wide part
with the tips of your fingers…

153
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:57,250
-Mm-hmm.
-…and it'll slide in easier. You'll see.

154
00:09:58,541 --> 00:09:59,375
All right.

155
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:02,166
-Did you get it? Mm.
-Mm. One moment. I'm trying it now.

156
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,208
Let's see.

157
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,250
Mmm, yeah. Went right in.

158
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,875
Bingo! What do you know?

159
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,708
They're different. Right?

160
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:13,708
It's wonderful.

161
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,375
-Raquel.
-Maca.

162
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,666
-So pretty tonight.
-Congratulations for winning.

163
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,000
Oh, thanks. It's nice to be recognized.

164
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,416
-How have you been?
-Well, overwhelmed as always.

165
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,291
The problem is Pipa.

166
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,625
Maca, I keep telling you,

167
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:35,125
with your potential, social media agencies
should be fighting over you.

168
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,875
Yeah. But I'm not sure
if that's what I want.

169
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,333
Well, whatever.
You shouldn't be exploited.

170
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:41,708
Obviously.

171
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,833
It's time to find new contacts for you.

172
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:48,875
Stand your ground, Maca.

173
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:49,875
For me? Really?

174
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,125
You deserve this.

175
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,500
Oh, thanks.

176
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,708
Well, I gotta go. This event
is extremely tedious, and I have a date.

177
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,583
-Have fun!
-Thank you.

178
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,083
-Ciao.
-Ciao.

179
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:52,166
Pipa!

180
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,625
I've already put in
a lot of overtime this week, so…

181
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:56,541
So?

182
00:11:57,041 --> 00:12:00,416
So I'm gonna be on my way.
You'll have to go back home on your own.

183
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,416
Mm-hmm.

184
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,916
And tomorrow, I'll coming in at 11:00.
No, 12:00.

185
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,333
Oh, darling.

186
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,916
-Yeah?
-Look at your feet.

187
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,625
Do you think that's okay?

188
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,375
I ask you to be smart about how you dress,

189
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:15,000
and you show up in front
of everyone tonight like this.

190
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,625
Well, Converse are in again.

191
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:20,500
Yeah. If you're cool enough
to get away with it.

192
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,500
That poor girl understands nothing.

193
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:51,250
Well, they cost a lot.
What else should I do?

194
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:54,375
Plus, I can't afford
to have such a dramatic episode.

195
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,500
Well, girls, you won't believe
what Pipa just did to me.

196
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,625
She is a fucking terrible person.

197
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,791
I was in the toilet. I bumped into Raquel,

198
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,416
the influencer I've talked to you about,
who's super nice.

199
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:08,250
Raquel?

200
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:28,416
Shit.

201
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,541
Leo's back.

202
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,041
And he's with Raquel.

203
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,083
-What's your name?
-Macarena.

204
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,541
Do you go by Maca or Macarena?

205
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:01,583
Maca.

206
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:04,666
Maca. I love "Maca."
This one's to you, Maca.

207
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,625
-And what's your name?
-My name's Leo.

208
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,166
What? No toast to me?

209
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:23,208
This was the deepest,
and most passionate story of my life.

210
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:25,958
Ever since that first look.

211
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:42,916
All the happiness movies had promised me
seemed real and eternal.

212
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:49,666
Okay. Now recite

213
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,583
second section of Article 66.

214
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:56,833
"When there are
two or more extenuating circumstances,

215
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,583
that means…"

216
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:02,583
"…the penalty next in degree
as prescribed by law…"

217
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,625
Maca, please. You know
I can't stand it when you do that.

218
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:23,041
-No. I can't stand you.
-No. I can't stand you.

219
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,083
-You are an imbecile.
-Shut up.

220
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,750
Our connection was intense.

221
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,708
Incredibly intense.

222
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,500
I thought that what we had was unique

223
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:39,250
and that it could never happen again
with anyone else.

224
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,166
Never.

225
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:49,333
But one day, he disappeared.

226
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,791
He suddenly left behind
the life we had planned together.

227
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:58,833
He never apologized.

228
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:01,500
He just left.

229
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And I ended up stuck,

230
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:06,250
thinking it would be impossible
for me to be happy without him.

231
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,541
What the hell is this?

232
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:20,166
-Come on.
-But… Okay. Close the door.

233
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,500
You haven't slept at all. Have you?

234
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,208
All right. Who needs coffee?

235
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:26,750
No. No. No. No. No.

236
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,833
-No, no, no. Maca, get up.
-Let's go. Get up.

237
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,333
-Okay. Help me with this.
-I'm fine. Really. Okay?

238
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,375
What?

239
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,125
-Shh. Come on.
-Real pants.

240
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,666
Come on. Here.

241
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,291
-Can't we sleep for a little while?
-No.

242
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:42,083
No. You will feel better.
Let's get breakfast.

243
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,166
That's it.

244
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,666
Excuse me.

245
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:51,666
-Carbs are good. Carbs are the best.
-Oh.

246
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,500
I put a hex on him
so he goes back to Boston.

247
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,958
-And made sure he got crabs.
-I'm so okay.

248
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,333
Girls, I'm fine.

249
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,458
You sent me this at four in the morning.

250
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,416
Oh, and wait for the one
you sent an hour later.

251
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,375
Okay, okay.

252
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,166
It hasn't been my best night.

253
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:14,875
Leo…

254
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:21,041
Leo was an important person in my life,
and the origin of some of my problems.

255
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:23,291
Thank you.

256
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:26,666
Your problems?

257
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:30,750
Okay. He's been
my fucking romantic trauma.

258
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,250
Now I see things
in a completely different light.

259
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,958
I understand what I've been going through.

260
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,666
I know this was society's fault.

261
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,250
They're the ones who got us girls
to believe in fairy tales.

262
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,166
You do seem better this time.

263
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,166
Someone who hurt me
and didn't even apologize…

264
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,833
It's just a bunch of bullshit.

265
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:53,791
I'm on the way to feeling more empowered.
This doesn't mean anything.

266
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:54,875
Nothing.

267
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:56,625
How was his body?

268
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,375
Still has the ass of a hunter-gatherer?

269
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:03,583
What? You help by comforting her.
I help by saying shit's gonna hit the fan.

270
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:06,125
Jime, I'm the new Maca.

271
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,333
I'm Maca 2.0.

272
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,041
Yeah?

273
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,875
You know Maca 2.0
needs a shower, right?

274
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,083
Okay. You got a point there.

275
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,041
Well,

276
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:18,916
bye, girls.

277
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,541
-Now take care.
-Take a shower.

278
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,666
-Thanks.
-Such a bitch.

279
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,458
-Ciao, Maca.
-Ciao.

280
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,583
You believed her about Leo?

281
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,625
She had 12 churros
and a cup of hot chocolate. She's fine.

282
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,625
Seriously? You actually fell for that?

283
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,166
-Adriana, please.
-Jime--

284
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,291
There is no Maca 2.0.

285
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,208
Listen. People can change for the better.

286
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,208
-I see.
-Yeah.

287
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:44,541
Let's see if you surprise us
and start having sex with your husband.

288
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,625
His skateboard.

289
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:54,625
Hmm. And you?
Have you thought about seeing a shrink?

290
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:55,541
What?

291
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:57,833
Jime.

292
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,000
Jime, not that boy. Ji…

293
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,208
Jime, where are you going?

294
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:05,333
No way.

295
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,041
Excuse me.

296
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,458
It's an emergency.

297
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,583
My back's out.

298
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,583
-So painful.
-You have an appointment?

299
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,958
Uh… No. No, no, no. Not really.

300
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,000
I woke up in pain just this morning.

301
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,375
I need to have a check by the guy
that just came in.

302
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,750
-Samuel?
-Yep.

303
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,166
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Samuel.

304
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,083
Yep, Sammy.

305
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,875
But are you one of his patients?
A relative? A friend?

306
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:03,333
Uh… No. No. Not yet. Not yet. No.

307
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:06,791
You'll have to call for an appointment.
There's no emergency service here.

308
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,166
Please. It's very important.

309
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,750
-We're all booked up--
-Samuel!

310
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:13,000
I need you to check my lower back.

311
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,625
So painful.

312
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,708
I can barely walk, jog, or do anything.

313
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,583
Wait a sec. Wait a sec.
Did you call ahead?

314
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,291
Not at all. I mean, she just walked in.

315
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:23,416
Marta, write down her contact info
and arrange an appointment this week.

316
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,000
-How's that sound?
-Ow!

317
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,291
Hey. Hey. Easy. Easy.

318
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,666
I can have a quick look, I suppose. Okay?

319
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,750
-Okay.
-All right?

320
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,583
If Mr. Luis arrives,
please ask him to wait a few minutes.

321
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:37,500
Okay.

322
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,625
Let's see. You'll have to explain
your problem better

323
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:44,708
because I didn't get it.

324
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:47,375
Okay. Well, I'd say that my…
my whole back hurts.

325
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,458
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
-Entirely.

326
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,375
From this spot down to here.

327
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,208
-Especially here. Oof!
-Mm-hmm.

328
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:58,791
Right in here. Here it… it hurts the most.
I can barely sit down now.

329
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:00,416
-Okay.
-Right here. My ass.

330
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,041
Uh, it's your sacrum, then? Okay.

331
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,833
Sacrum, ass, yep.

332
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:04,875
Let's take a look.

333
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,625
Okay.

334
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,208
-Can I ask you something?
-Mm-hmm.

335
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:20,500
Would you say that the name Santi Asenjo…

336
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:23,166
-Does that mean anything to you?
-Who?

337
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:25,375
Of course, when someone reincarnates,

338
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:27,125
they're not aware
they've been reincarnated.

339
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:29,041
I don't know
what you're talking about.

340
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:30,875
All right. Let me see something.

341
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,791
If I press on this spot, does it hurt?

342
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:34,833
Because you're not complaining as much.

343
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:36,000
Oh. Let's see.

344
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:38,625
-Ooh!
-Hurts?

345
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:40,166
-Oof!
-So bad.

346
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,791
-Okay.
-Yeah.

347
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:48,250
Anyway, even though you don't remember,
I'm sure you like the same things.

348
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:52,041
You may recall the sword of Aragorn
in the battle of Morannon.

349
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:54,500
"I bid you stand, Men of the East!"

350
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,750
-Okay. Right now I need you to breathe in.
-Yeah. Okay.

351
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:00,750
And breathe out.

352
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:07,458
Ow! Fuck!

353
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:08,791
Ow.

354
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:13,500
Okay. I'm out of time, but tell Marta
to make an appointment this week

355
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:15,416
because your back's a real mess.

356
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,916
-Oh, sure. Okay.
-All right?

357
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:21,833
Oh, and it's,
"I bid you stand, Men of the West."

358
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:23,708
Great.

359
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,041
I knew it.

360
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:43,375
Hello. May I help you with something?

361
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:45,708
How may I help you?

362
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,291
No. How may I help you?

363
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:49,916
What do you need?

364
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:56,875
Any problem with my heels?

365
00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:59,416
No. No, no, no. Don't get confused.

366
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:03,166
It's you who shouldn't get confused,
honey. I can see how you're judging me.

367
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,125
No. No, no. Not at all.
I've always admired people who wear heels.

368
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:09,416
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm sure you'll say
you have lots of friends who are gay.

369
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,541
Actually, a lot of my friends are gay.
Excuse me.

370
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:15,166
Hmm. How typically progressive.

371
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:18,666
Pipa, a new assistant?

372
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,083
You need to be taken down a notch.

373
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:24,125
I simply set my conditions.

374
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:26,500
This isn't Lavapiés,

375
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:28,916
and in this neighborhood,
it's exactly the opposite.

376
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,750
Besides, Luigi really values
this opportunity.

377
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:46,166
An intern?

378
00:24:46,916 --> 00:24:47,750
Any pay?

379
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:50,125
I'm paid in love.

380
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:53,791
Do you know about trip planning,

381
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:57,041
agenda management, brand contacting,

382
00:24:57,125 --> 00:25:00,000
social media management,
positioning tricks, statistics,

383
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,791
long-term planning, photography?

384
00:25:05,291 --> 00:25:06,125
Well, yeah.

385
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:13,833
This is super-important.

386
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,041
Double-sided tape,
super-important, especially with Pipa.

387
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,333
And your name was?

388
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,166
Here's your dress.

389
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:42,958
You will look gorgeous. You'll see.

390
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:46,125
If you need anything, call me.

391
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:49,000
Listen, um…

392
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:52,333
I was thinking.
Have you tried fucking in public places?

393
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:54,791
In public? I mean…

394
00:25:56,958 --> 00:26:00,041
we've tried some tantra, role-playing,

395
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:01,583
that thing with choking.

396
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:05,958
The other day, we pretended
we didn't know each other at a bar.

397
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:07,625
-And did it work?
-Mm…

398
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:13,375
-What about a threesome?
-Are you serious?

399
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:16,583
Why not? It could be a good incentive.

400
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:20,041
But what if he falls for the girl?

401
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:21,583
Or would it be with a guy?

402
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:23,375
Hey. What if he falls for the guy?

403
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:30,416
What's wrong?

404
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:32,875
Look. Look at this.

405
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:35,250
Let's see. Don't panic. Let's take a look.

406
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:37,625
But my wedding is this Saturday.

407
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:39,833
I've been on a strict diet.
I don't understand.

408
00:26:39,916 --> 00:26:42,125
It's because you're nervous. Don't worry.

409
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:45,000
Well, now I'm more nervous than ever!

410
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,833
So what's happening?

411
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:51,458
I need to lose five fucking pounds
and I'm getting married in four days.

412
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:53,958
Well, honestly,
I think you look completely stunning.

413
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:57,625
Seriously. And your fiancé
won't really care about five pounds.

414
00:26:57,708 --> 00:26:58,666
Ugh!

415
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,916
Or does it matter?

416
00:27:00,416 --> 00:27:02,250
-You think it matters?
-Mm-hmm.

417
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:04,791
Let me tell you. If it matters to him
about just five pounds,

418
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:06,125
that's a bad start for you.

419
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:07,208
Why?

420
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:10,000
What'll happen
when you start getting your wrinkles?

421
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:14,041
Or when your body doesn't get back
to what it used to be after a baby?

422
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:16,708
If that's the case,
then I would say the boy's not worth it.

423
00:27:16,791 --> 00:27:19,375
It's better to realize that now
than after you're married.

424
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:22,666
You aren't the one here with the problem.
The problem is the guy.

425
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:23,666
What?

426
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:25,916
It's better to be on your own than--

427
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,083
Maca! It's better… it's better
if we continue our conversation later.

428
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:33,125
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't worry. Don't worry.

429
00:27:33,208 --> 00:27:37,375
We'll go to the dressmaker's today
and we'll fix it up in a couple of hours.

430
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:39,916
-You'll look stunning. I promise you.
-No. No.

431
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:51,000
WANNA FCK?

432
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:56,291
-Maca.
-Huh?

433
00:27:56,791 --> 00:27:58,750
-Why don't we go to my house?
-Hmm? No.

434
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,666
-Banging in here makes my muscles cramp.
-No.

435
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,666
Your place is such a mess,
and I always end up cleaning.

436
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,208
That's your excuse?

437
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:10,416
-Maca.
-What?

438
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,333
Emotionally, are we not in the same place?

439
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,791
-Sure we are.
-Maybe you're starting to have feelings.

440
00:28:16,875 --> 00:28:18,958
-What is this?
-No? Okay.

441
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:26,291
Maca, babe. How are you?

442
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:29,916
Look. The opening
of my eco-art exhibition is this Saturday.

443
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,500
And, babe, the media will be there,

444
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:33,916
along with a lot of people
from the industry.

445
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,833
People who would
be interested in hiring you.

446
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:39,583
Besides, I'd love to see you there.

447
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:41,250
Come on. Give it a shot.

448
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:43,666
I really think you're ready
to leave Pipa behind.

449
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:46,333
I'll wait to hear from you. Kisses.

450
00:28:50,416 --> 00:28:53,125
CRAPPY DECISION

451
00:29:06,916 --> 00:29:08,333
We have to go.

452
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:10,000
In this situation,

453
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:12,958
if my priority is my career,
what choice is there?

454
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:14,541
It's important to do that.

455
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:18,166
No way. No way. No way.
This is a bad idea. Leo's gonna be there.

456
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:31,291
I need to have complete access
to all of Raquel's contacts.

457
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,750
You're the one with all the maturity,
who must also understand

458
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:36,875
that it would be a catastrophe.

459
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:39,875
There is life
beyond Raquel's contacts, so-called.

460
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:43,916
Maturity?I could never really
focus on myself.

461
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:47,000
My life used to revolve around Leo.

462
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:50,708
And now I'm still taking him into account
when making all my decisions.

463
00:30:31,166 --> 00:30:35,833
I love the lines and dichotomy
of the piece being stuck inside of glass.

464
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:38,500
Excuse me.

465
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,208
Maca?

466
00:30:45,958 --> 00:30:47,041
Leo.

467
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:48,208
What, uh…

468
00:30:48,791 --> 00:30:51,083
-Are you here with your new girlfriend?
-I'm sorry?

469
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:52,000
Huh?

470
00:30:53,791 --> 00:30:55,166
Why are you here?

471
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:59,333
Well, finding new contacts
because that means I can quit.

472
00:30:59,416 --> 00:31:02,875
-Raquel's my buddy.
-Wait. Wait. How do you… how do you--?

473
00:31:02,958 --> 00:31:04,791
Hey. You guys know each other?

474
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:06,250
Yeah.

475
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:07,500
Yes. We were--

476
00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:10,708
We dated for a bit, way back when, but…
Years ago.

477
00:31:10,791 --> 00:31:13,458
Wow.
I'll have to question you about him, then.

478
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:15,791
Uh, no. That won't help.
I'm sure she barely remembers me.

479
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,166
-Raquel?
-Hmm?

480
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,333
What a wonderful display.
Who's the artist?

481
00:31:19,416 --> 00:31:21,375
-Another time.
-One of my discoveries.

482
00:31:22,708 --> 00:31:25,208
-You wanna meet the artist, yeah? Okay.
-Yeah. Of course.

483
00:31:32,416 --> 00:31:33,291
Thanks.

484
00:31:44,041 --> 00:31:45,541
How are you? Having fun?

485
00:31:46,708 --> 00:31:47,625
And you?

486
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:51,666
How did you end up here looking for a job?

487
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,875
Seems kinda curious.

488
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:57,125
What's curious is you having a girlfriend
who's an influencer.

489
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,333
Hey. So you didn't finish
your law studies?

490
00:32:00,416 --> 00:32:02,416
You put so much effort
into learning the penal code.

491
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,750
The thing is,
when we're young we waste our time.

492
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:08,791
-Hmm.
-And you?

493
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:12,000
For a philologist bohemian,
funny place to be.

494
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,875
Yes. Well, now I'm a professor
at the university.

495
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:17,041
That's why I'm back in Madrid. To teach.

496
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:19,375
-You're here for that?
-Mm-hmm.

497
00:32:19,458 --> 00:32:21,791
I guess your dreams
were a little out of reach.

498
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:24,000
Yeah. At least I had a dream.

499
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:27,833
Well, hope everything goes great.

500
00:32:27,916 --> 00:32:31,083
Your classes, your relationship
with Raquel. You've got it all.

501
00:32:32,041 --> 00:32:34,708
Maca, can we just talk like adults?

502
00:32:34,791 --> 00:32:35,958
Sure.

503
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:37,250
Yeah. Of course we can.

504
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,583
Hey. How's being back in Madrid?

505
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,500
It's fine. Fine. Great.
I just rented an apartment downtown--

506
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:45,958
-You're kidding! Where is it?
-In… in Chamberí.

507
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:47,458
-Wow.
-What?

508
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:50,625
-That's kinda pricey for a teacher.
-I've been granted tenure.

509
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:54,916
I'm glad that all these years of your life
has been a straight road to success.

510
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,916
No obstacles.

511
00:32:56,625 --> 00:32:58,958
Is it possible
that you're being a bit sarcastic?

512
00:32:59,041 --> 00:33:01,416
That's silly. I've grown up as well.

513
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,583
Really? I don't think so, Maca.

514
00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:05,666
Your eyes tell me
you're stuck in the same place.

515
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,291
You're the one who's stuck in place.

516
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:08,833
A place where a guy fucks up,

517
00:33:08,916 --> 00:33:11,500
never apologizes, time passes,
and we're all friends again, right?

518
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:13,625
Maca, it's been years.

519
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:15,875
You need to get over it.

520
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:20,708
What do you want me to say?
That I'm a moron?

521
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:23,541
Okay. Then I'm a moron,
and I always will be. You happy?

522
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:33,875
You know what you are?
A little fucking coward.

523
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:38,000
Oh!

524
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:54,791
He's very cute, isn't he? Leo.

525
00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:57,416
Yes. He's very cute.
Did you get to know him well?

526
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,708
No. We were only together
five years or so.

527
00:33:59,791 --> 00:34:02,416
Five years? But didn't he say that…?

528
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:06,500
I know. But Leo is a free spirit.
He says one thing and does another.

529
00:34:07,416 --> 00:34:08,833
Uh, what do you mean?

530
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:13,250
Let's get this straight.
I wanna ruin this man's life

531
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:16,958
because it isn't fair that things
go so well for scum like this douche.

532
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:18,875
But I also want to save her.

533
00:34:18,958 --> 00:34:22,291
Wouldn't you say "look out"
to someone who's about to fall in a well?

534
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:25,958
That's what I'm doing, 'cause I wish
someone gave me a spoiler back then.

535
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:27,125
Sisterhood.

536
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:29,958
Well,

537
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,291
he smashed my heart against the floor,

538
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:35,833
he danced on it, and then trampled
all over it until he pulverized it.

539
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:39,583
Uh, but what happened, Maca?

540
00:34:39,666 --> 00:34:41,916
He's the worst piece of shit
that ever lived.

541
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,708
He discarded me like trash
and destroyed my future.

542
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,333
I'll leave you with this, Raquel.

543
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:49,833
Run away. Run away and never look back.

544
00:34:50,708 --> 00:34:52,375
Ooh. Gotta go. Look at what time it is.

545
00:34:55,708 --> 00:34:56,583
You okay?

546
00:34:59,916 --> 00:35:01,833
How did your week go, Jimena?

547
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:03,208
Not bad. Not bad.

548
00:35:04,541 --> 00:35:08,541
I managed to get the first encyclopedia
about the paranormal to my publisher.

549
00:35:08,625 --> 00:35:09,750
That's great to hear,

550
00:35:09,833 --> 00:35:12,833
but I was actually asking about the pain
you've been having in your back.

551
00:35:12,916 --> 00:35:14,958
Ah. My back.

552
00:35:15,041 --> 00:35:17,125
-Mm-hmm.
-Bad. Really bad.

553
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:18,041
Oh.

554
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:19,708
Okay.

555
00:35:20,666 --> 00:35:22,416
Turn your head to the right for me.

556
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,208
Okay. Now to the left.

557
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:27,625
Okay.

558
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:32,375
What do you think of love?

559
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,875
What kind of question is that?

560
00:35:37,958 --> 00:35:39,833
I don't know. It seems normal to me.

561
00:35:39,916 --> 00:35:43,041
A normal question
for your psychologist or a friend,

562
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:44,916
but not your physiotherapist.

563
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:51,625
-You know what the problem is?
-Tell me.

564
00:35:51,708 --> 00:35:53,916
I do happen to have
an annoying pain in my back.

565
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,416
-Mm-hmm.
-But what I'd really like is to…

566
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,375
to maybe have a drink with you.

567
00:36:03,666 --> 00:36:06,333
The problem is,
I don't date my clients, Jimena.

568
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:09,416
Samuel, we get along really well.

569
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,291
Yeah. That's true.

570
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:12,291
What do you think?

571
00:36:13,166 --> 00:36:16,166
A drink. It might be weird
if you and I went out.

572
00:36:18,166 --> 00:36:20,833
Why? It'd just be a drink.
A quick drink. Yeah?

573
00:36:20,916 --> 00:36:22,416
-A quick drink?
-Sure.

574
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,625
-Okay. That does sound good.
-Of course it sounds good.

575
00:36:24,708 --> 00:36:26,375
It sounds good. Be a quick drink.

576
00:36:29,916 --> 00:36:31,875
A quick drink and after that…

577
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:35,916
-After that, then we'll see.
-Right.

578
00:36:36,416 --> 00:36:37,458
For sure.

579
00:36:51,416 --> 00:36:54,750
Don't laugh at me,
but I could really use some Nesquik.

580
00:37:18,666 --> 00:37:19,541
Well…

581
00:37:22,416 --> 00:37:23,250
…a toast?

582
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,958
-Here's to tonight.
-Here's to tonight.

583
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:29,166
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

584
00:37:50,416 --> 00:37:51,250
Come on.

585
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:47,125
Come on.

586
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,791
-Macarena Bartual?
-Yes, that's me.

587
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,041
YOUR DIGNITY WILL REMEMBER YOU

588
00:39:40,125 --> 00:39:41,916
I'm so sorry.

589
00:39:47,208 --> 00:39:48,541
DEAR MACARENA,

590
00:39:48,625 --> 00:39:52,500
MY MOST SINCERE CONDOLENCES
FOR THE LOSS OF YOUR WILLPOWER.

591
00:39:52,583 --> 00:39:54,875
WARM REGARDS, LEO
PS FUCK YOU.

592
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:09,708
SCHOOL OF HUMANITIES

593
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:30,625
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

594
00:40:30,708 --> 00:40:33,250
Okay. Without further ado,
I'm assigning you a paper.

595
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:34,875
Yes. Yes. Yes.

596
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,416
I want you to reflect on the amour fou.

597
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,041
-What?
-Love induced madness.

598
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:43,750
You mean falling for someone big time?

599
00:40:43,833 --> 00:40:44,708
Yes. Exactly.

600
00:40:44,791 --> 00:40:48,458
Or not being able to distinguish
between expectations and reality.

601
00:40:49,041 --> 00:40:52,708
The authors from this century
would describe a woman's idea of love

602
00:40:53,208 --> 00:40:54,333
as agonizing.

603
00:40:54,916 --> 00:40:57,958
Love could even be considered
a form of mental illness.

604
00:40:58,041 --> 00:40:59,125
Maybe they're right.

605
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:01,541
Honestly, I was expecting you
to have way more sensitivity

606
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,208
being a literature professor.

607
00:41:03,291 --> 00:41:05,250
Oh!

608
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:08,208
What the…

609
00:41:08,916 --> 00:41:09,791
What did you say?

610
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:11,541
I mean, you read and analyze everything,

611
00:41:11,625 --> 00:41:15,000
but it seems like you can't understand
basic human emotions.

612
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,958
Excuse me, miss, but this isn't a debate
about my emotional abilities.

613
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:20,333
No. Of course we can't debate

614
00:41:20,416 --> 00:41:22,541
about something
that clearly doesn't exist.

615
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,208
Hold on. Hold on.

616
00:41:24,291 --> 00:41:29,791
No. I'm talking about a specific moment
of 19th-century literature.

617
00:41:29,875 --> 00:41:33,708
By saying that women
have this amour fou. Right?

618
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:37,208
And not clarifying it isn't intrinsic
to them without context either.

619
00:41:37,291 --> 00:41:38,541
You're right.

620
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:40,041
That's what they wrote.

621
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:42,625
Let me remind you that this
is a literature class, not history.

622
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:45,791
Okay. Well, you should consider
a much more critical format.

623
00:41:45,875 --> 00:41:47,125
-Yeah.
-It's true.

624
00:41:47,208 --> 00:41:49,291
-It's true.
-You know. She's got a point.

625
00:41:50,666 --> 00:41:52,000
Why are you in my class?

626
00:41:52,083 --> 00:41:54,750
Check your roster.
I'm auditing.

627
00:41:55,375 --> 00:41:57,125
Hmm. No. Don't worry about it.

628
00:41:57,208 --> 00:42:00,375
Let's be clear. This has nothing to do
with my personal opinion.

629
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:04,250
In fact, I am… I'm a feminist,
and I totally stand for gender equality.

630
00:42:04,333 --> 00:42:06,583
Yeah, though?

631
00:42:06,666 --> 00:42:08,458
Come on, man. What is this BS?

632
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:09,375
That's right.

633
00:42:09,458 --> 00:42:11,500
If you're pointing out
a way of explaining love

634
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:14,041
that is more detrimental for women,
we need to criticize it

635
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:16,333
since that has brought us
to where we are now.

636
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:19,583
We're confused and we're carrying
the weight of an impossible construct.

637
00:42:19,666 --> 00:42:21,458
Yeah! Whoo!

638
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:22,833
That's right. Uh-huh.

639
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:25,166
Hold on. Hold on.
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

640
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:28,333
Can you please explain to me
how the way I explain a literary period

641
00:42:28,416 --> 00:42:30,791
is related to the problems
you face nowadays?

642
00:42:30,875 --> 00:42:32,750
The romantic pressure is a narrative

643
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:36,416
that makes us believe we need
the first charming asshole we come across.

644
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,583
Yes! Yes! Yes!

645
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:42,541
Hey! But don't worry
because it's less common now. Right?

646
00:42:42,625 --> 00:42:43,875
I'm sure whoever you're with

647
00:42:43,958 --> 00:42:46,208
will quickly see your true self
and leave you.

648
00:42:46,291 --> 00:42:48,250
Oh. Whoo! Whoo!

649
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:50,708
And fuck that paper you want us to do.

650
00:42:50,791 --> 00:42:52,375
Tell him, "Fuck that!"

651
00:42:52,458 --> 00:42:54,625
Hey! But we can't just stop here.

652
00:42:54,708 --> 00:42:56,125
Let's visit the director of studies

653
00:42:56,208 --> 00:42:58,666
to protest
against this intolerable sexism.

654
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:01,208
Get your testosterone
out of our brains, asshole.

655
00:43:01,958 --> 00:43:06,125
Fuck testosterone!
Fuck testosterone!

656
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,041
Very well.

657
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:10,625
Fuck testosterone!
Fuck testosterone!

658
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:14,041
Fuck testosterone!

659
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:15,500
Okay. Do whatever you want.

660
00:43:16,291 --> 00:43:18,958
Let me remind you
that if you leave before class ends,

661
00:43:19,041 --> 00:43:21,458
you'll be marked absent,
and attendance is part of your grade.

662
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:32,208
Will you tell me
what the hell you're doing?

663
00:43:32,291 --> 00:43:35,958
First, you tell Raquel so many lies
about me that she no longer trusts me.

664
00:43:36,041 --> 00:43:37,458
You ain't seen nothing yet.

665
00:43:37,541 --> 00:43:40,541
And now… now you turn my students
against me. For what?

666
00:43:40,625 --> 00:43:44,208
What about the flowers?
That was a dick move, and you know it.

667
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:45,666
Right. The flower delivery…

668
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:48,291
Look. Maca, we need to stop this.

669
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:51,541
It's… it's absurd. I mean… Right?
We can't go on like this.

670
00:43:51,625 --> 00:43:52,708
Besides, at our age--

671
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:55,416
I can't stand it
when you talk down to me like that.

672
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,791
Like it's my fault
that I suffered after our breakup,

673
00:43:57,875 --> 00:43:59,291
or that I loved you so much.

674
00:44:00,166 --> 00:44:01,000
I wish that I hadn't.

675
00:44:04,583 --> 00:44:06,125
You could try to understand.

676
00:44:07,541 --> 00:44:08,583
But never mind.

677
00:44:09,083 --> 00:44:10,333
I shouldn't care anymore.

678
00:44:12,833 --> 00:44:13,916
But you do, Maca.

679
00:44:15,875 --> 00:44:17,125
And I care about it too.

680
00:44:19,125 --> 00:44:22,000
Because, in the end, only the two of us
know what we feel for each other.

681
00:44:22,083 --> 00:44:24,208
Used to feel, Leo. Don't forget that.

682
00:44:27,333 --> 00:44:29,083
Maca, you drive me crazy, but…

683
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:33,291
…I still wanna kiss you.

684
00:44:36,458 --> 00:44:38,250
Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.

685
00:44:39,833 --> 00:44:41,291
You wanna kiss me too, right?

686
00:44:42,583 --> 00:44:43,583
I could feel it.

687
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:48,333
You're so conceited and insufferable.

688
00:44:48,833 --> 00:44:50,083
Stop screwing with me.

689
00:44:52,166 --> 00:44:53,958
I'd love to screw you right here, Maca.

690
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:55,916
Right on the table.

691
00:45:00,166 --> 00:45:01,625
Of course you'd like that.

692
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:03,083
You'd love it.

693
00:45:03,916 --> 00:45:06,375
Because you've missed me.
I'm sure of that, Leo.

694
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,375
You're so close that I can smell you.

695
00:45:54,291 --> 00:45:55,333
Now we're even.

696
00:45:56,833 --> 00:45:57,916
Huh?

697
00:45:58,750 --> 00:45:59,583
Two, two.

698
00:46:02,208 --> 00:46:03,041
Huh.

699
00:46:03,125 --> 00:46:04,708
I hate you.

700
00:46:05,458 --> 00:46:08,041
Hey. Hey. Maca, don't be like that.
Come on.

701
00:46:08,125 --> 00:46:09,583
That's the game, right?

702
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:12,166
You made a fool of me
in front of my class.

703
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:13,541
It's not the same at all.

704
00:46:15,916 --> 00:46:16,791
Maca.

705
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:35,250
INTERNATIONAL SCHOLARSHIPS

706
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:52,208
I'm calling him again.

707
00:46:52,291 --> 00:46:54,875
-Mm-hmm.
-He must be stuck in traffic.

708
00:47:20,291 --> 00:47:21,916
FOR RENT

709
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:39,666
Maca? Maca!

710
00:47:41,666 --> 00:47:43,666
Why don't we go through
our agenda in Milan.

711
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:46,500
-These two days are going to get intense.
-Yes, I know.

712
00:47:47,291 --> 00:47:49,583
Did you download the app for relaxation?

713
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:52,250
-I can't get on a plane without it.
-Under control.

714
00:47:52,333 --> 00:47:53,291
That's a good girl.

715
00:47:59,375 --> 00:48:01,958
Now, Maca, we really
don't have time for more fashion shows.

716
00:48:02,041 --> 00:48:03,833
Are you sure you didn't make any mistakes?

717
00:48:03,916 --> 00:48:06,166
I'm seeing too much time booked for meals.

718
00:48:06,666 --> 00:48:09,708
Do it however you want,
but you need to fix this schedule. Okay?

719
00:48:12,791 --> 00:48:13,708
Here I go.

720
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:18,250
Hey, Pipa, um,
what happened the other day at the last…

721
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:21,291
…at the last event with my shoes.

722
00:48:21,375 --> 00:48:22,625
What are you talking about?

723
00:48:22,708 --> 00:48:24,958
Well, I just think
that you owe me a bit more respect,

724
00:48:25,041 --> 00:48:27,083
and you shouldn't show me up
in front of your friends.

725
00:48:27,166 --> 00:48:28,791
-Did I do that?
-Yeah.

726
00:48:28,875 --> 00:48:31,291
And my patience
isn't a bottomless well. You know?

727
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:33,833
Yeah. Well, life can be hard.
That's for sure.

728
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:36,875
Okay.

729
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:41,750
-Maca, what's happening?
-Just some turbulence. Relax.

730
00:48:41,833 --> 00:48:43,500
-Maca, will you please go ask.
-Okay.

731
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:46,083
-You have to remain seated.
-Sorry.

732
00:48:46,166 --> 00:48:47,625
-Oh God.
-You okay?

733
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:50,958
I don't wanna die.
I don't wanna die. I don't wanna die.

734
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:52,583
Ugh. I can't put this on.

735
00:48:55,458 --> 00:48:56,583
Oh, Maca, I'm scared.

736
00:48:56,666 --> 00:48:58,791
How do you think
they'll remember me if I die?

737
00:48:59,708 --> 00:49:02,333
I wanna be a role model.
I wanna be a role model.

738
00:49:03,833 --> 00:49:06,083
Inhale. Exhale.

739
00:49:06,666 --> 00:49:09,291
Maca, you need to film this moment.
Come on. Film me.

740
00:49:11,166 --> 00:49:15,333
Let me mess up my hair a little.
It should look a bit shocking.

741
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:17,500
-How's that?
-Yeah.

742
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:20,625
Hello! We are on a plane
that just might crash.

743
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:23,041
Something may happen.
So if anything happens,

744
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:25,958
I just want you to know I love you
and that my last thoughts are of you.

745
00:49:26,041 --> 00:49:29,041
And you can upload a video
with #WeAreAllPipa.

746
00:49:29,125 --> 00:49:30,583
That's it. We're all Pipa! Whoo!

747
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:33,250
-Done?
-Yes.

748
00:49:33,333 --> 00:49:36,291
This is lasting too long.

749
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:39,875
Oh, Maca, I'm scared.
I'm scared. I'm scared.

750
00:49:39,958 --> 00:49:42,041
The captain
would like to remind you

751
00:49:42,125 --> 00:49:44,958
to remain seated and seat belts
securely fastened. Thank you.

752
00:49:46,333 --> 00:49:49,041
Ma'am? Ma'am. Excuse… Ma'am!

753
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:53,416
What is this? Why are you here?

754
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,708
We are going down fast, eh?

755
00:49:55,791 --> 00:49:58,333
These may be your last minutes,
and you were thinking about me.

756
00:49:58,416 --> 00:49:59,833
Not your parents, not Jime,

757
00:49:59,916 --> 00:50:02,125
Adriana, or even peace
in the world. Just me.

758
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:04,458
Lately, all I can think about
is how much I hate you.

759
00:50:05,458 --> 00:50:07,791
I don't know.
Seems like you just think of me.

760
00:50:09,333 --> 00:50:11,125
Can I grant you a final wish?

761
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:14,333
Should we kiss? Or… or if you want,
we can go fuck in the bathroom.

762
00:50:14,416 --> 00:50:15,500
Hmm. Whatever you want.

763
00:50:37,208 --> 00:50:39,125
Hey. Wait.

764
00:50:39,208 --> 00:50:40,416
Maca, open up!

765
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:45,375
Maca!

766
00:50:49,875 --> 00:50:52,250
Don't look at me like that.
He deserves it.

767
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:57,958
Jeez. You've been acting
really creepy lately.

768
00:50:58,583 --> 00:51:00,375
Post my video when we land. Got it?

769
00:51:08,291 --> 00:51:11,916
-All right. Did you land okay?
-Yes. Yes. It was just a bad scare.

770
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,750
It was an out-of-body experience.

771
00:51:15,625 --> 00:51:16,833
You hyperventilated.

772
00:51:16,916 --> 00:51:18,875
The important thing is I locked him away.

773
00:51:19,458 --> 00:51:20,625
He's gone.

774
00:51:20,708 --> 00:51:23,708
See, that's the problem.
You locked him up, but he's in your mind.

775
00:51:23,791 --> 00:51:26,166
You should've thrown him
out of the plane instead.

776
00:51:27,041 --> 00:51:28,916
What happened the last time you met?

777
00:51:35,916 --> 00:51:36,750
Whatever.

778
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:39,333
It was the last time.

779
00:51:41,416 --> 00:51:42,500
Here's to the last time!

780
00:51:42,583 --> 00:51:44,916
-To the last time!
-To the last time!

781
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:49,416
Mm. What about you guys? What's new?

782
00:51:49,916 --> 00:51:52,166
What about you?
How's life after the three-way?

783
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:55,208
What? Fine. No big deal.

784
00:51:55,291 --> 00:51:56,750
No big deal? Really?

785
00:51:56,833 --> 00:51:59,375
I mean, you try pussy for the first time,
and that's all you say?

786
00:51:59,458 --> 00:52:01,500
-Jime…
-What? I think it's totally outrageous.

787
00:52:01,583 --> 00:52:04,291
-Well, I won't go into details.
-You will!

788
00:52:05,291 --> 00:52:06,250
No.

789
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:09,500
So I'm sure the hot girl
was nothing special.

790
00:52:09,583 --> 00:52:10,875
What about Julián?

791
00:52:36,541 --> 00:52:37,375
Whoa.

792
00:52:43,333 --> 00:52:44,750
It's like, um…

793
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:46,583
like we're re-activating.

794
00:52:47,083 --> 00:52:48,333
It's simple as that.

795
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,250
These trivial games have been good for us

796
00:52:51,333 --> 00:52:53,958
because that's all
they really were, to me.

797
00:52:54,666 --> 00:52:56,083
Well, I'm surprised.

798
00:52:56,166 --> 00:52:59,791
I mean, I thought you'd had enough
of Julián and you two were done.

799
00:53:00,708 --> 00:53:02,625
-Of Julián?
-Yeah.

800
00:53:03,583 --> 00:53:06,250
You guys, Julián is my partner.

801
00:53:06,833 --> 00:53:09,250
Getting a divorce
would be the last thing I want.

802
00:53:09,833 --> 00:53:12,583
Throwing away everything we've built,
start renting again,

803
00:53:12,666 --> 00:53:14,500
taking selfies for Tinder.

804
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:17,125
No, thanks.

805
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:19,291
Hey. Your masseuse?

806
00:53:20,875 --> 00:53:21,916
It didn't work out.

807
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,875
-Really?
-You were great together.

808
00:53:23,958 --> 00:53:24,791
Yeah.

809
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:28,625
Something happened that was kinda creepy.

810
00:53:29,541 --> 00:53:30,541
Jime.

811
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,583
You will never guess
what one of my patients just gave me.

812
00:53:34,958 --> 00:53:38,958
Isn't he cute?
You can name him if you want.

813
00:53:41,875 --> 00:53:44,166
You broke up with him
because he likes hamsters?

814
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:46,416
He really likes them. Crazy for them.

815
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,541
It's the first relationship you've had
that's lasted more than a month.

816
00:53:49,625 --> 00:53:50,875
And the sex was great.

817
00:53:52,125 --> 00:53:54,375
Yeah. But…

818
00:53:55,625 --> 00:53:57,416
he really likes hamsters, you guys.

819
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,333
Loves them.

820
00:53:59,083 --> 00:54:01,250
Girl, it's obvious he wasn't Santi.

821
00:54:01,791 --> 00:54:03,750
I have to keep searching. That's all.

822
00:54:06,958 --> 00:54:08,000
I gotta pee.

823
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,833
I think she went to go cry.

824
00:54:16,291 --> 00:54:19,000
She keeps going like this,
she'll die alone.

825
00:54:20,041 --> 00:54:20,875
Or not.

826
00:54:29,916 --> 00:54:31,333
Good afternoon. Jimena?

827
00:54:31,416 --> 00:54:32,250
Yeah.

828
00:54:40,125 --> 00:54:41,208
Can I come in?

829
00:54:49,833 --> 00:54:51,583
This will get you started.

830
00:54:52,375 --> 00:54:54,875
I'm not sure
if I can pretend to be someone else.

831
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,375
And what do actors do?

832
00:54:56,458 --> 00:54:58,666
Re-tweet lost dog posts
and give up gluten?

833
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:02,125
Besides, in your ad,
you say you like challenges.

834
00:55:02,208 --> 00:55:06,291
Yeah. I meant, like, I don't know,
pretending that I'm disabled or Norwegian.

835
00:55:06,375 --> 00:55:08,625
What you're asking me to do
is freaking crazy.

836
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:13,333
Oh yeah. Um, Santi broke his wrist
three times skating.

837
00:55:13,916 --> 00:55:15,625
-Yeah.
-Would that work for you?

838
00:55:15,708 --> 00:55:17,625
But why would she believe any of this?

839
00:55:17,708 --> 00:55:20,708
Well, logic and Jime have been
in a complicated relationship

840
00:55:20,791 --> 00:55:21,750
for 15 years.

841
00:55:22,708 --> 00:55:25,583
She'll believe you're Santi.
Then you'll say goodbye to her forever.

842
00:55:25,666 --> 00:55:27,708
Um, you'll liberate her.

843
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:30,500
And you'll help a wonderful cause.

844
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:33,333
Actors like to do that stuff. Don't they?

845
00:55:34,416 --> 00:55:37,750
Yeah. But what if she asks me something
that hasn't been written down?

846
00:55:38,333 --> 00:55:39,208
Improvise.

847
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,000
And you know that being an actor
is really going to help you.

848
00:55:43,083 --> 00:55:44,333
It'll be super easy.

849
00:55:44,416 --> 00:55:47,041
You have two dates
and then you'll be all done.

850
00:55:47,916 --> 00:55:50,166
Well? What is this gonna cost?

851
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:52,458
Oh man. I really hate eggnog.

852
00:55:54,166 --> 00:55:57,083
Well, it's absolutely essential
that you like eggnog.

853
00:55:57,166 --> 00:56:00,125
Well then, the eggnog will cost extra.

854
00:56:02,041 --> 00:56:03,875
My favorite is the second one.

855
00:56:03,958 --> 00:56:06,000
Well, my favorite is the last one.

856
00:56:06,083 --> 00:56:07,958
I know most people love The Two Towers,

857
00:56:08,041 --> 00:56:11,083
but I just watched them, like,
20 times lately, and now I'm sure of it.

858
00:56:11,166 --> 00:56:13,500
Hey, you never used to care about Tolkien.

859
00:56:13,583 --> 00:56:16,166
My tastes have completely changed.
It's incredible.

860
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:17,375
And since when?

861
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:21,416
Um, I don't know.
I'd say about two months or so.

862
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:22,500
The powder.

863
00:56:22,583 --> 00:56:25,500
And then your name just started popping
into my head, like, all the time.

864
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:28,250
"Jime Herrera. Jime Herrera."
So, I had to find you.

865
00:56:28,333 --> 00:56:29,625
You must think I'm crazy.

866
00:56:29,708 --> 00:56:32,750
-Oh my God. No.
-Mm.

867
00:56:34,041 --> 00:56:35,958
And what happened to your wrist?

868
00:56:36,625 --> 00:56:37,916
Oh yeah. That.

869
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,750
I mean, the thing is that all of a sudden
I felt the need to hop on a skateboard.

870
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:45,125
I bought one and look what happened.
Triple fracture.

871
00:56:45,875 --> 00:56:47,500
Can I ask you something else?

872
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:48,875
Yeah. Sure.

873
00:56:48,958 --> 00:56:51,291
A band, a city, a type of cheese,

874
00:56:51,375 --> 00:56:53,916
an animal you hate,
and an episode of The Simpsons.

875
00:56:54,708 --> 00:56:56,166
Wow. Okay.

876
00:56:56,791 --> 00:56:58,291
Um… Let's see.

877
00:56:58,375 --> 00:56:59,833
A band? Slipknot.

878
00:57:01,625 --> 00:57:02,708
Uh, Edinburgh.

879
00:57:03,208 --> 00:57:04,333
Emmental.

880
00:57:04,916 --> 00:57:08,166
-Um, the Pinchy episode of The Simpsons.
-Love that one!

881
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:11,291
And… Oh, and fucking rodents. I hate them.

882
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:23,583
Where the hell did they hide you?

883
00:57:31,291 --> 00:57:35,791
I FOUND HIM. HE'S SANTI!

884
00:57:38,375 --> 00:57:39,250
Maca.

885
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:43,583
Maca.

886
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,958
I just want to apologize.

887
00:57:52,875 --> 00:57:55,083
Not just for what happened
in my office, but…

888
00:57:57,083 --> 00:57:58,208
for everything else.

889
00:57:59,583 --> 00:58:01,583
I mean, I left with no explanation.

890
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:03,958
It was all wrong.

891
00:58:04,958 --> 00:58:05,791
Wrong and…

892
00:58:06,291 --> 00:58:10,125
and I'm really sorry because I didn't mean
to hurt you. I swear.

893
00:58:17,583 --> 00:58:19,833
You seemed pretty convinced
of your decision.

894
00:58:21,083 --> 00:58:21,916
No.

895
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:24,458
No, Maca, it was really hard for me

896
00:58:24,958 --> 00:58:28,541
to live my life without having you
always by my side, driving me crazy.

897
00:58:31,333 --> 00:58:32,333
I'm so sorry.

898
00:58:35,833 --> 00:58:36,958
I really mean it.

899
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:44,250
Could we be friends?

900
00:58:57,041 --> 00:58:57,958
Okay.

901
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,166
What are you doing?

902
00:59:15,291 --> 00:59:16,666
Complicating my life.

903
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:28,708
I got to have
a say on the guest list,

904
00:59:28,791 --> 00:59:30,541
so, naturally Raquel was invited.

905
00:59:31,375 --> 00:59:33,250
I even added a plus-one for her.

906
00:59:33,875 --> 00:59:35,333
But, of course, I hope it isn't Leo.

907
00:59:35,416 --> 00:59:39,000
Even though he apologized to me,
I really don't wanna see him right now.

908
00:59:40,958 --> 00:59:41,833
Maca!

909
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:49,875
Maca, call Mateo.
My ponytail's coming undone.

910
00:59:49,958 --> 00:59:51,958
-Do you want me to fix it?
-No. Call Mateo.

911
00:59:52,041 --> 00:59:52,916
Got it. I'll call him.

912
00:59:56,708 --> 00:59:58,833
Mateo, Mateo, Mateo.

913
00:59:58,916 --> 00:59:59,750
Maca!

914
01:00:00,916 --> 01:00:03,291
-Hey. Hi.
-Is this your bag now?

915
01:00:03,375 --> 01:00:05,500
It was a gift from Pipa. From Milan.

916
01:00:05,583 --> 01:00:08,750
She felt bad about the other event.
She's not so bad.

917
01:00:09,833 --> 01:00:11,791
Sweetheart, I was there
when they gave it to her.

918
01:00:11,875 --> 01:00:12,916
She said she didn't want it

919
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,791
because it had been touched
by too many people.

920
01:00:17,625 --> 01:00:20,625
It's just… the stress
just makes me want to lose it.

921
01:00:20,708 --> 01:00:22,166
No. It's okay.

922
01:00:25,375 --> 01:00:29,333
Raquel, I'm… I'm really sorry
for what I said the other day about Leo.

923
01:00:30,541 --> 01:00:31,791
Um, it's no problem.

924
01:00:32,333 --> 01:00:35,041
The truth is, we've made an effort
to improve our communication,

925
01:00:35,125 --> 01:00:36,666
and it's actually working.

926
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:37,583
I'm glad.

927
01:00:38,166 --> 01:00:39,708
Why don't we all go out to dinner?

928
01:00:39,791 --> 01:00:42,958
-No.
-Yeah. We can consider it a new beginning.

929
01:00:44,958 --> 01:00:46,916
Is it time to act like a grown-up?

930
01:00:48,625 --> 01:00:51,125
-Of course.
-Or bring a date if you like.

931
01:00:51,916 --> 01:00:53,291
Well, I'll tell my boyfriend.

932
01:00:53,875 --> 01:00:55,708
-Oh.
-I have to call the hairdresser.

933
01:00:55,791 --> 01:00:56,833
It's for Pipa.

934
01:00:57,333 --> 01:00:58,416
See you around.

935
01:00:58,500 --> 01:00:59,833
-Okay. Ciao.
-Ciao.

936
01:01:05,958 --> 01:01:08,083
You can't run away from him all your life.

937
01:01:08,166 --> 01:01:11,083
He apologized, you've calmed down,
you haven't lost it.

938
01:01:11,166 --> 01:01:12,583
You can be friends with a guy.

939
01:01:12,666 --> 01:01:14,500
Friends? What are you saying?

940
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,333
That's all I need to hear.

941
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:20,833
Now we're gonna be friends with Leo? Ugh.

942
01:01:20,916 --> 01:01:24,125
CRAPPY DECISION

943
01:01:30,875 --> 01:01:33,875
-You drink a lot, huh?
-Sure. For years.

944
01:01:33,958 --> 01:01:35,041
Okay. Yeah.

945
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,500
WHY WON'T U RESPOND?

946
01:01:38,583 --> 01:01:41,041
ARE YOU MAD AT ME?
DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG?

947
01:01:41,125 --> 01:01:43,916
Hey. Would you like to go
to an exhibition on Friday?

948
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,041
The Reina Sofía museum
has an interesting one

949
01:01:46,125 --> 01:01:47,958
that I've been meaning to see
before it leaves.

950
01:01:48,458 --> 01:01:50,958
Uh… Yeah. I don't know.

951
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,333
I was thinking I'd come back here.

952
01:01:53,416 --> 01:01:55,291
-To the skate park?
-Sure.

953
01:01:55,375 --> 01:01:58,541
But neither of us has any idea
what we're doing on a skateboard.

954
01:01:58,625 --> 01:02:02,541
Pfft. Sure. But I just like being
around here with these guys.

955
01:02:02,625 --> 01:02:04,083
Santi loved to do that.

956
01:02:04,166 --> 01:02:07,291
Besides, I thought I'd buy some good weed
and get nice buzz. Know what I mean?

957
01:02:07,375 --> 01:02:10,041
Oof. Joints don't go well
with me anymore, Jorge.

958
01:02:10,125 --> 01:02:10,958
Ah.

959
01:02:21,625 --> 01:02:22,458
Maca.

960
01:02:24,125 --> 01:02:25,666
What the fuck are you wearing?

961
01:02:30,291 --> 01:02:32,916
Remember, we love each other
and we're happy.

962
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,750
We're moving in together,
and you are very intelligent.

963
01:02:36,833 --> 01:02:37,666
Okay.

964
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:42,125
We are looking for an apartment
around La Latina or Barrio de las Letras.

965
01:02:42,208 --> 01:02:44,083
Mm, I love those neighborhoods.

966
01:02:44,166 --> 01:02:46,291
But we are thinking
about moving to the countryside.

967
01:02:46,375 --> 01:02:47,500
I mean, aren't we?

968
01:02:47,583 --> 01:02:49,041
-Yep.
-The countryside?

969
01:02:49,125 --> 01:02:52,208
But Leo wears repellent every time
he goes past the city limits.

970
01:02:53,208 --> 01:02:56,625
I'd say it's about time he made friends
with the earth mother. Right?

971
01:02:56,708 --> 01:02:59,750
-He'll reconnect with the earth mother.
-Earth mother.

972
01:02:59,833 --> 01:03:00,666
You really should.

973
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:03,166
The truth is that the air quality
in the city's unbearable.

974
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:05,541
Hmm.
Well, then if you're moving to La Latina…

975
01:03:06,041 --> 01:03:07,041
Thank you.

976
01:03:07,125 --> 01:03:10,166
-Mm.
-Mm. I take my lead from Maca.

977
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:17,750
Um… So, Coque, what do you do, exactly?

978
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:19,708
Aside from getting really nice tattoos.

979
01:03:20,333 --> 01:03:22,583
Thank you. Well, a bit of everything.

980
01:03:22,666 --> 01:03:23,916
DJ, podcasts, monologues…

981
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,125
-Monologues?
-Yes.

982
01:03:25,208 --> 01:03:27,416
Apartment prices
really have plummeted downtown, huh?

983
01:03:28,375 --> 01:03:29,833
And what are your monologues about?

984
01:03:29,916 --> 01:03:33,291
-Raquel, how's the urban garden project?
-Wait. Don't tell me. Don't tell me.

985
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,708
About millennial fucking.

986
01:03:35,666 --> 01:03:36,500
You've been to one?

987
01:03:37,583 --> 01:03:39,625
It's cool you do so many things, Coque.

988
01:03:39,708 --> 01:03:42,750
Indeed. And they say
there are no entrepreneurs anymore.

989
01:03:42,833 --> 01:03:44,250
-A toast.
-You sound like an old man.

990
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:45,250
Salud.

991
01:03:45,333 --> 01:03:47,083
I am an old man, in spirit.

992
01:03:47,166 --> 01:03:48,083
I know. I know.

993
01:03:48,166 --> 01:03:51,000
You've been wearing smoking jackets
at home since you were ten, right?

994
01:03:51,083 --> 01:03:52,208
That's crazy.

995
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:54,958
Really freaking crazy.

996
01:03:55,041 --> 01:03:57,958
-I'm sure you still wear them.
-No. Do you know what's crazy?

997
01:03:58,041 --> 01:04:00,416
What's crazy is that we don't know
where my smoking jacket is

998
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,375
because it disappeared, mysteriously.

999
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:04,083
Um…

1000
01:04:04,166 --> 01:04:05,958
No. You can finally confess.
It's been a while.

1001
01:04:06,041 --> 01:04:07,375
-No. It…
-Where's the jacket?

1002
01:04:07,458 --> 01:04:09,666
Oh, don't ask me.
It must be in the same place as…

1003
01:04:10,833 --> 01:04:11,833
Now wait a minute.

1004
01:04:13,083 --> 01:04:14,333
Oh, that thing.

1005
01:04:14,416 --> 01:04:17,166
-Yeah.
-I totally forgot! Are you for real?

1006
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:18,791
-No. Not there.
-In the same place?

1007
01:04:18,875 --> 01:04:20,916
Yes. Yes.

1008
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,666
-No.
-Yes.

1009
01:04:23,458 --> 01:04:24,916
Do you know why I thought you hid it?

1010
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,416
Do you remember the day your mom
brought the lasagna, I think it was?

1011
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,666
-It had meat in it?
-What… what about the urban gardens?

1012
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:32,375
I'm really interested in all that, Raquel.

1013
01:04:32,458 --> 01:04:35,291
Because we both want
an apartment with a balcony.

1014
01:04:35,833 --> 01:04:37,458
It's important. A balcony.

1015
01:04:40,916 --> 01:04:44,291
I don't know. I didn't, uh,
think it'd be someone like him.

1016
01:04:44,375 --> 01:04:46,083
You can't judge a book
by its cover.

1017
01:04:46,166 --> 01:04:48,000
-Yeah.
-Raquel liked him.

1018
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,583
Because Raquel is charming with everyone.

1019
01:04:52,083 --> 01:04:55,125
-So is it true you're moving in together?
-Why wouldn't it be?

1020
01:04:55,208 --> 01:04:58,958
I don't know, Maca. I don't… I don't know
if he's the right one for you.

1021
01:05:00,208 --> 01:05:01,666
And who is the right one for me?

1022
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,416
Oh, DJ. So interesting.

1023
01:05:04,916 --> 01:05:07,375
That's great. Yeah. Please let us know.

1024
01:05:08,375 --> 01:05:09,458
Hey.

1025
01:05:09,541 --> 01:05:11,416
-Shall we go?
-Yeah. Let's go.

1026
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:14,000
-We should do this again sometime. Yeah?
-Yes. Well…

1027
01:05:14,083 --> 01:05:15,125
-Soon?
-Soon.

1028
01:05:15,208 --> 01:05:16,458
-Yeah.
-Oh yeah.

1029
01:05:17,208 --> 01:05:18,666
-Ciao.
-Ciao.

1030
01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:21,875
-It went well, right?
-You want a drink?

1031
01:05:27,208 --> 01:05:29,250
Hey, Adriana. Let's grab some lunch.

1032
01:05:29,333 --> 01:05:31,625
I'm mixed up about Leo.
Well, I mean… I'm not saying…

1033
01:05:31,708 --> 01:05:35,208
What I mean is I need to talk to you,
and you're the most sensible of us.

1034
01:05:35,291 --> 01:05:37,875
I'll come by your shop
and we'll talk, okay? Later.

1035
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:57,583
You see?

1036
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:03,166
Come on.

1037
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:10,833
Maca!

1038
01:06:14,666 --> 01:06:15,916
-Stunning.
-Hmm?

1039
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:19,166
Before leaving, remember
to organize my bags too. Okay?

1040
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:20,583
I have to go. I have a date.

1041
01:06:20,666 --> 01:06:22,833
If you hurry up,
you'll finish before eight today.

1042
01:06:23,625 --> 01:06:25,791
-Okay. Have fun.
-Thanks, darling.

1043
01:06:32,458 --> 01:06:35,666
MACA, I'M PASSING YOUR CV AROUND.

1044
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:37,708
I'LL KEEP YOU POSTED.

1045
01:06:45,125 --> 01:06:45,958
Hey there.

1046
01:06:47,541 --> 01:06:48,791
How do you know where I work?

1047
01:06:49,375 --> 01:06:50,791
Well, I did some research.

1048
01:06:52,291 --> 01:06:53,125
Wow.

1049
01:06:53,625 --> 01:06:54,875
I'm sorry.

1050
01:06:55,625 --> 01:06:57,708
Lately, he can't stop with the apologies.

1051
01:06:58,875 --> 01:07:00,166
I like it, okay?

1052
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:02,166
How about dinner?

1053
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:03,500
With Raquel?

1054
01:07:04,541 --> 01:07:06,333
As in, "I want her to come along."

1055
01:07:06,916 --> 01:07:08,166
No. It's just, the thing is,

1056
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:11,541
I'm writing an academic article
on love in contemporary literature, and…

1057
01:07:12,708 --> 01:07:14,916
and I'd love for you
to give me your opinion.

1058
01:07:17,208 --> 01:07:18,541
It has to be quick.

1059
01:07:18,625 --> 01:07:20,416
-At the bar, okay?
-Okay.

1060
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:28,458
Generally speaking, I like it,
but… I don't know. Something is missing.

1061
01:07:28,541 --> 01:07:29,458
Like what?

1062
01:07:30,083 --> 01:07:32,750
You need to, um,
connect yourself emotionally.

1063
01:07:33,541 --> 01:07:36,125
There's only theory and analysis
of these stories,

1064
01:07:36,208 --> 01:07:37,750
but it's from a distance.

1065
01:07:37,833 --> 01:07:38,666
I see.

1066
01:07:39,166 --> 01:07:40,125
So what, then?

1067
01:07:41,375 --> 01:07:44,875
Look all around you,
not just in the pages of a book.

1068
01:07:45,958 --> 01:07:46,916
All around me?

1069
01:07:48,166 --> 01:07:50,791
Yeah. At the people everywhere.

1070
01:07:51,291 --> 01:07:54,333
At your own memories. At your experiences.

1071
01:07:55,458 --> 01:07:57,625
You know that observing my reality
and reflecting on it

1072
01:07:57,708 --> 01:07:59,166
is a little bit hard for me.

1073
01:08:02,041 --> 01:08:03,416
Hey, should we eat something?

1074
01:08:04,041 --> 01:08:06,125
She's not replying to my texts either.

1075
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:09,125
Pipa must have her hooks in her again.

1076
01:08:09,875 --> 01:08:11,041
I'm sure that's true.

1077
01:08:11,958 --> 01:08:12,958
So how are you?

1078
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:15,208
Oh, pretty good.

1079
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:16,958
Or not.

1080
01:08:17,041 --> 01:08:19,875
Actually, I'm super great. Yeah.

1081
01:08:19,958 --> 01:08:21,750
Or even greater than super great.

1082
01:08:21,833 --> 01:08:22,833
Seriously?

1083
01:08:22,916 --> 01:08:24,541
Santi number two is…

1084
01:08:26,666 --> 01:08:29,125
I don't have words for how great he is.

1085
01:08:29,791 --> 01:08:32,208
Oh, but, uh…
He's still with you?

1086
01:08:32,291 --> 01:08:33,333
Yeah. Of course.

1087
01:08:34,083 --> 01:08:37,125
I spent forever looking for him.
Anyway, we better go.

1088
01:08:41,333 --> 01:08:44,208
JORGE, YOU DIDN'T BREAK UP WITH HER YET?

1089
01:08:44,291 --> 01:08:45,958
NO

1090
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:49,583
WHY?

1091
01:08:49,666 --> 01:08:52,041
I LOVE HER!

1092
01:08:52,541 --> 01:08:55,125
He's my man. Like Julián's yours.

1093
01:08:55,208 --> 01:08:57,541
Hmm.

1094
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:02,875
-Jime.
-Yeah?

1095
01:09:06,333 --> 01:09:09,041
I have a 50% discount
on wedding dresses, if you want.

1096
01:09:10,708 --> 01:09:12,250
-Interested?
-There's a plan.

1097
01:09:12,333 --> 01:09:13,833
-Right?
-We'll throw a wedding party

1098
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:15,041
before you know it, right?

1099
01:09:15,125 --> 01:09:17,000
-Come on. Let's go.
-Okay.

1100
01:09:18,083 --> 01:09:19,000
My God.

1101
01:09:25,458 --> 01:09:27,250
-It's weird.
-What is?

1102
01:09:28,041 --> 01:09:30,500
You're the same,
but you've also changed a lot.

1103
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:31,708
How so?

1104
01:09:33,958 --> 01:09:35,958
I guess you're more mature.

1105
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:40,916
I don't know.
I feel like it would be different now.

1106
01:09:43,375 --> 01:09:45,416
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not insinuating anything.

1107
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:46,541
Oh yeah. Yeah.

1108
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:53,041
The thing is, Raquel's happy,
and you look so serene,

1109
01:09:53,125 --> 01:09:55,541
that I don't identify it
with what we were at all.

1110
01:09:56,666 --> 01:09:59,833
Maca, what we had, you and me,
was really special.

1111
01:10:01,291 --> 01:10:02,833
We were happy too. Remember?

1112
01:10:04,666 --> 01:10:07,166
I don't know. At least I have
good memories from back then.

1113
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:08,083
Yeah.

1114
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:15,666
I want you to think about what we had as…
as an amazing time, Maca.

1115
01:10:16,166 --> 01:10:19,875
I know we went through a lot of hardship,
but it was incredible.

1116
01:10:21,291 --> 01:10:23,208
And it has helped us
become who we are today.

1117
01:10:24,625 --> 01:10:26,041
I don't know who I am.

1118
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,375
You're a fantastic woman,

1119
01:10:32,208 --> 01:10:33,833
and a smoking jacket thief,

1120
01:10:34,791 --> 01:10:35,625
stubborn,

1121
01:10:37,083 --> 01:10:39,583
someone who's able
to start a riot in my own class…

1122
01:10:41,958 --> 01:10:43,833
whose eyes are amazing.

1123
01:10:47,541 --> 01:10:49,416
But mostly really stubborn.

1124
01:11:17,791 --> 01:11:18,875
Check out this house.

1125
01:11:19,458 --> 01:11:23,083
It has water recycling,
a vegetable garden, solar panels.

1126
01:11:23,166 --> 01:11:24,541
I love it.

1127
01:11:30,458 --> 01:11:32,875
Jime, I need to tell you something.

1128
01:11:32,958 --> 01:11:34,708
It's a message from Santi.

1129
01:11:37,458 --> 01:11:39,500
Jime, I have a message for you.

1130
01:11:39,583 --> 01:11:41,750
-From Santi?
-Yeah.

1131
01:11:42,291 --> 01:11:44,791
Um… Well, I'm getting…

1132
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,583
that you are amazing,
and I enjoy spending time with you.

1133
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:55,000
I mean, we get each other.
Don't you believe it's true?

1134
01:11:55,083 --> 01:11:56,791
-Don't we laugh together?
-Totally.

1135
01:11:57,458 --> 01:12:00,125
It's his sense of humor
that connected me the most to Santi.

1136
01:12:00,958 --> 01:12:03,916
-But… but I'm funny too. Don't you think?
-I mean, to me.

1137
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:10,333
Listen to this.

1138
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,666
"For it shows things that were,
and things that are,

1139
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:16,833
things that yet may be.
But which it is that he sees…"

1140
01:12:16,916 --> 01:12:19,291
"…even the wisest
cannot always tell."

1141
01:12:19,375 --> 01:12:21,291
-The Lord of the Rings?
-Yeah.

1142
01:12:21,375 --> 01:12:22,583
That's it. That's it.

1143
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:32,708
I'm so happy with you.

1144
01:12:32,791 --> 01:12:34,291
I feel the same.

1145
01:12:37,125 --> 01:12:39,166
But you can't go on
like this, Adriana.

1146
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:40,291
Yeah, I know.

1147
01:12:41,166 --> 01:12:42,583
I think about it all day.

1148
01:12:45,958 --> 01:12:46,958
Me too.

1149
01:12:56,416 --> 01:12:57,416
I have to go.

1150
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:06,833
Hey.

1151
01:13:07,541 --> 01:13:08,500
Hey.

1152
01:13:10,375 --> 01:13:11,458
It wasn't your fault.

1153
01:13:12,416 --> 01:13:14,583
This thing with Raquel
wasn't going anywhere.

1154
01:13:16,166 --> 01:13:17,458
It's not your fault, but…

1155
01:13:18,708 --> 01:13:21,375
Maca, I haven't stopped thinking about you
since I saw you again.

1156
01:13:24,375 --> 01:13:26,125
If this was a romantic comedy,

1157
01:13:26,208 --> 01:13:28,458
it would start pouring rain
right this minute.

1158
01:13:33,708 --> 01:13:35,250
Maca, I'm sorry. I didn't…

1159
01:13:36,041 --> 01:13:37,083
I didn't plan this.

1160
01:13:38,083 --> 01:13:39,791
I know I'm an asshole and I deserve it.

1161
01:13:39,875 --> 01:13:41,708
You have every right to be pissed at me.

1162
01:13:42,875 --> 01:13:45,750
If you were the one who left,
I would still be lost without you.

1163
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,625
You're right. I'm a jerk.

1164
01:13:50,083 --> 01:13:52,375
I'm an insufferable prick
who screwed up someone's life

1165
01:13:52,458 --> 01:13:53,875
and I can't even apologize for it.

1166
01:13:54,875 --> 01:13:56,333
Yes. It's true, Maca.

1167
01:13:56,416 --> 01:13:58,416
I think no one's good enough for you

1168
01:13:58,500 --> 01:13:59,583
because I love you.

1169
01:14:00,166 --> 01:14:01,083
I love you.

1170
01:14:02,541 --> 01:14:06,166
Fine. If this really were
a romantic comedy for sure,

1171
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:08,291
I would've jumped into his arms already.

1172
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,750
Because I only exist when you see me.

1173
01:14:11,833 --> 01:14:13,791
-No, don't tell me that.
-I'm telling the truth.

1174
01:14:13,875 --> 01:14:15,458
You exist even if I'm blind.

1175
01:14:16,375 --> 01:14:17,208
See?

1176
01:14:18,375 --> 01:14:19,750
You still exist. Don't you?

1177
01:18:57,958 --> 01:18:58,791
Hey.

1178
01:19:01,208 --> 01:19:03,041
Need anything?

1179
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,750
-Huh?
-Sure.

1180
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:12,125
-Is this coffee? Oh.
-No.

1181
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:14,416
-Milk?
-Yeah. Exactly.

1182
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:15,791
Just milk. Okay.

1183
01:19:15,875 --> 01:19:18,125
This is… Okay. I see.

1184
01:19:18,625 --> 01:19:20,750
-Here. Is this one mine?
-Uh… Either.

1185
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:22,625
-Yeah.
-Yep.

1186
01:19:26,125 --> 01:19:27,458
Clothespin looks nice.

1187
01:19:31,708 --> 01:19:34,291
Welcome to the world of Pipa.

1188
01:19:34,375 --> 01:19:38,166
So, we finally get to see
the lair of the beast.

1189
01:19:40,375 --> 01:19:42,833
-Oh my God. You work here, Maca?
-Yes.

1190
01:19:45,125 --> 01:19:47,333
No. But, I mean, seriously?

1191
01:19:48,833 --> 01:19:50,500
Whoa. You're sure she won't show up?

1192
01:19:50,583 --> 01:19:52,791
Nope. She's in Ibiza this weekend.

1193
01:19:52,875 --> 01:19:55,708
-What is all this?
-I hope she never comes back again.

1194
01:19:56,375 --> 01:19:58,291
Should I remind you
she's the one paying me?

1195
01:19:58,375 --> 01:19:59,583
Yeah. Yeah.

1196
01:19:59,666 --> 01:20:01,166
Seriously. When I was her age,

1197
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:03,541
I was living with my parents
and had zero prospects.

1198
01:20:03,625 --> 01:20:04,583
Hello, girls.

1199
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:05,833
Hello.

1200
01:20:07,750 --> 01:20:08,958
What is this?

1201
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,208
-Fan for your ego?
-Oh, yes, if you would. Just a bit.

1202
01:20:13,291 --> 01:20:14,375
Ooh.

1203
01:20:14,458 --> 01:20:16,875
Careful. That's six months
what she pays Maca.

1204
01:20:17,375 --> 01:20:19,000
This is way too much stuff.

1205
01:20:19,583 --> 01:20:20,416
Whoa.

1206
01:20:22,166 --> 01:20:24,875
Hey. Hello. How are you doing?

1207
01:20:24,958 --> 01:20:27,875
I'm a millionaire, and I get paid
for uploading pics on Instagram.

1208
01:20:29,541 --> 01:20:30,375
Adriana,

1209
01:20:31,166 --> 01:20:32,166
do I look like her?

1210
01:20:34,041 --> 01:20:36,958
Hey. Not bad. Not bad.
Just give me some more arrogance.

1211
01:20:37,041 --> 01:20:39,166
Yes. And less empathy in my eyes, right?

1212
01:20:39,666 --> 01:20:41,666
Love it.

1213
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:44,000
And this is the best part.

1214
01:20:45,166 --> 01:20:47,000
Help yourselves, ladies.

1215
01:20:47,083 --> 01:20:49,000
Wait. Hold on. Can we try on anything?

1216
01:20:49,083 --> 01:20:50,666
-Yes.
-This is crazy.

1217
01:20:50,750 --> 01:20:52,958
So, honestly,
you can take whatever you want.

1218
01:20:53,041 --> 01:20:54,958
These are all gifts
she doesn't even remember.

1219
01:20:55,041 --> 01:20:56,208
I'm gonna cry.

1220
01:20:56,291 --> 01:20:58,041
Ooh là, là, comment ça va ?

1221
01:20:58,125 --> 01:20:59,708
Ooh, mon chéri.

1222
01:21:00,375 --> 01:21:01,291
Maca.

1223
01:21:01,875 --> 01:21:03,875
Oh, Maca, no more eating.

1224
01:21:03,958 --> 01:21:05,000
Maca.

1225
01:21:05,083 --> 01:21:07,791
Maca, no more breathing.

1226
01:21:07,875 --> 01:21:10,250
I don't get why I still don't have
ten million followers.

1227
01:21:10,333 --> 01:21:12,666
It's, ugh… it's all your fault, Maca.

1228
01:21:14,875 --> 01:21:15,708
Darling,

1229
01:21:16,333 --> 01:21:18,583
you know that I'd prefer it
if you wore heels.

1230
01:21:18,666 --> 01:21:19,875
They give a better impression.

1231
01:21:40,958 --> 01:21:44,875
Yeah!

1232
01:22:07,916 --> 01:22:09,000
Here's to us.

1233
01:22:09,083 --> 01:22:11,250
And to getting thoroughly wasted tonight.

1234
01:22:12,833 --> 01:22:13,666
Salud.

1235
01:22:14,166 --> 01:22:18,083
Wow. Adriana, you look so damn hot
in that dress, girl. I cannot believe it.

1236
01:22:18,166 --> 01:22:19,291
-So hot.
-Really?

1237
01:22:19,375 --> 01:22:20,208
Keep it.

1238
01:22:20,708 --> 01:22:22,291
-What?
-Yes. Keep it.

1239
01:22:22,375 --> 01:22:23,583
You're serious?

1240
01:22:24,333 --> 01:22:27,416
Yes! I'll only be able to wear it
for a little while anyway, because--

1241
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:29,708
Come on. What's with the complexes?

1242
01:22:29,791 --> 01:22:32,541
Girls, I need to tell you something.

1243
01:22:33,958 --> 01:22:37,375
I've been saying
my life needed a change of some kind.

1244
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:41,208
Adriana, look. The most important step
is to accept it.

1245
01:22:41,291 --> 01:22:43,458
We won't have any issues with it.
No matter what.

1246
01:22:44,291 --> 01:22:45,291
What's happening?

1247
01:22:46,291 --> 01:22:48,500
Julián and I have decided
to take the next step.

1248
01:22:51,375 --> 01:22:53,041
We are trying to have a baby.

1249
01:22:53,708 --> 01:22:55,083
-We want a baby!
-What?

1250
01:22:55,583 --> 01:22:56,708
Am I gonna be an aunt?

1251
01:22:56,791 --> 01:22:58,541
You could even be the godmother.

1252
01:22:58,625 --> 01:22:59,708
What? Oh… Oh my…

1253
01:23:01,791 --> 01:23:04,125
Well, we have to celebrate
this kinda thing, right?

1254
01:23:04,208 --> 01:23:07,208
Uh, yeah. We… No.
We need to go somewhere… As amazing as--

1255
01:23:07,291 --> 01:23:09,500
-Oh, please no.
-I know a fucking great rooftop bar.

1256
01:23:09,583 --> 01:23:11,791
-It has a pool. You'll love it.
-All right. Let's go.

1257
01:23:13,416 --> 01:23:16,000
Oh, hey. I'll catch up with you
in a bit. Okay?

1258
01:23:16,083 --> 01:23:17,000
-Okay.
-Okay.

1259
01:23:19,666 --> 01:23:20,625
Yeah? Go ahead.

1260
01:23:20,708 --> 01:23:22,666
Bonsoir, Macarena Bartual?

1261
01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:23,791
This is her.

1262
01:23:23,875 --> 01:23:25,791
I'm calling from Good Mode Magazine.

1263
01:23:25,875 --> 01:23:27,916
I'm Clément Dubois, the editor.

1264
01:23:28,458 --> 01:23:30,166
Yes. Hello. Good evening.

1265
01:23:30,666 --> 01:23:33,083
-I assume you've heard of Good Mode.
-Yes.

1266
01:23:33,166 --> 01:23:34,750
Uh, Raquel sent us your resume

1267
01:23:34,833 --> 01:23:36,750
and gave us
really good references for you.

1268
01:23:36,833 --> 01:23:39,416
To tell you the truth,
we really like your profile.

1269
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:40,375
Amazing.

1270
01:23:40,458 --> 01:23:42,000
We're looking for someone new

1271
01:23:42,083 --> 01:23:44,125
to head up
the magazine's new media strategy,

1272
01:23:44,208 --> 01:23:48,041
with lots of experience in social media,
and we thought of you.

1273
01:23:48,541 --> 01:23:50,250
Would you be at all interested?

1274
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:53,208
Thank you so much.
You… you won't regret this.

1275
01:23:53,291 --> 01:23:56,041
I mean, I'll do my absolute best.

1276
01:23:56,125 --> 01:23:58,750
You'd be joining
our communications department.

1277
01:23:58,833 --> 01:24:03,000
I should tell you that this position
is based in Paris, uh, not in Madrid.

1278
01:24:03,083 --> 01:24:04,375
Have you ever been to Paris?

1279
01:24:04,875 --> 01:24:06,875
Paris? Yes.

1280
01:24:06,958 --> 01:24:09,416
Uh… Je t'aime beaucoup.

1281
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:13,875
J'adore Paris. La Tour Eiffel,
le pain au chocolate, le croissant…

1282
01:24:13,958 --> 01:24:15,333
Oh, le croissant!

1283
01:24:15,416 --> 01:24:18,250
Superb. We would need you
to start immediately.

1284
01:24:18,333 --> 01:24:21,125
Do you think you can give us an answer
in the next two weeks?

1285
01:24:21,208 --> 01:24:23,125
In two weeks. Oui.

1286
01:24:23,208 --> 01:24:26,333
Yes. Or before then.
Merci beaucoup, Macarena.

1287
01:24:26,416 --> 01:24:28,666
Merci, au revoir.

1288
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:30,875
Ah!

1289
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:28,500
-I love you so much.
-Aww.

1290
01:25:28,583 --> 01:25:30,041
We'll always be together, right?

1291
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:32,666
-Always, right?
-Always.

1292
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:35,250
Whoo!

1293
01:25:36,333 --> 01:25:38,708
Oh, this is great. I love you so much.

1294
01:25:43,208 --> 01:25:44,291
I love Leo.

1295
01:25:44,375 --> 01:25:46,250
-What?
-I love Leo!

1296
01:25:46,333 --> 01:25:47,250
What?

1297
01:25:47,333 --> 01:25:48,625
I love him.

1298
01:25:48,708 --> 01:25:49,791
I love Leo.

1299
01:25:50,458 --> 01:25:53,250
When I'm with him, I just feel as if…

1300
01:25:54,416 --> 01:25:57,208
It's very difficult to put into words.

1301
01:25:57,291 --> 01:25:59,416
But my heart has these feelings.

1302
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:00,583
And my head…

1303
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:04,416
It looks like she's tripping
down memory lane.

1304
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:07,083
Maca. Hey, what year is it?

1305
01:26:07,833 --> 01:26:09,541
Have you got your flip-phone?

1306
01:26:09,625 --> 01:26:11,791
Are mp3s still trendy?

1307
01:26:11,875 --> 01:26:14,458
Can you still play the Snake game?

1308
01:26:14,541 --> 01:26:16,958
Wait. What? Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1309
01:26:17,458 --> 01:26:19,541
-What?
-Maca, you're with him now?

1310
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,708
After everything he did to you though?

1311
01:26:22,791 --> 01:26:26,041
Didn't you lock him in a toilet
on that plane? Don't tell me he got out.

1312
01:26:26,125 --> 01:26:30,291
No. No, no, no. I really didn't want to,
but he smells so good.

1313
01:26:30,375 --> 01:26:32,666
Hey, I haven't forgotten. No. No.

1314
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:35,791
Maca, listen to me.
Weren't you empowering yourself?

1315
01:26:35,875 --> 01:26:37,375
What the fuck are you saying?

1316
01:26:37,458 --> 01:26:39,041
Okay. Enough. I'm going.

1317
01:26:39,125 --> 01:26:40,125
No, Adriana.

1318
01:26:41,250 --> 01:26:42,458
Adriana!

1319
01:26:42,541 --> 01:26:45,750
Girl, he left you all broken.
He is your kryptonite.

1320
01:26:45,833 --> 01:26:46,666
Maca!

1321
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:49,416
You left us for that guy. You know that.

1322
01:26:50,208 --> 01:26:53,125
Maca, I get it now. That's why you put up
with this shit from Pipa.

1323
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:56,250
Because whenever he appears,
nothing else matters.

1324
01:26:56,333 --> 01:26:59,416
You gotta cut this out.
Seriously. Right now.

1325
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:02,000
I know what I should do,
and I don't really care.

1326
01:27:02,083 --> 01:27:04,000
Like you have the hots
for the three-way girl,

1327
01:27:04,083 --> 01:27:06,041
but you wanna get pregnant
by your husband,

1328
01:27:06,125 --> 01:27:08,333
even though you haven't
given a damn about him for years.

1329
01:27:08,416 --> 01:27:10,708
Wait. Did you fall for the three-way girl?

1330
01:27:12,250 --> 01:27:13,500
I saw you.

1331
01:27:16,166 --> 01:27:19,041
-That's not fair.
-I saw you guys, and you looked happy.

1332
01:27:19,125 --> 01:27:23,000
You were glowing. And now
you're gonna go have a kid with Julián?

1333
01:27:23,583 --> 01:27:26,500
I don't know if things'll work with Julia.
It's not that fucking easy.

1334
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:30,791
And are you really gonna settle
because you're afraid of being alone?

1335
01:27:30,875 --> 01:27:31,791
Take a chance!

1336
01:27:32,458 --> 01:27:34,708
Says the one hiding
behind her first boyfriend

1337
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:36,625
instead of fucking moving on
with her life.

1338
01:27:40,166 --> 01:27:42,708
Okay. Any more secrets, you big phonies?

1339
01:27:42,791 --> 01:27:44,583
Yeah. Santi's dead! So move on!

1340
01:28:01,333 --> 01:28:02,166
So yes.

1341
01:28:03,666 --> 01:28:05,416
We all have our own kryptonite.

1342
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:09,625
And it seems it's easier
to lock it up than to face it.

1343
01:28:10,458 --> 01:28:14,541
That night, each of us decided
to run away from our uncomfortable truths

1344
01:28:14,625 --> 01:28:16,416
by seeking comfort at home.

1345
01:28:22,833 --> 01:28:24,416
How'd it go with the girls?

1346
01:28:25,375 --> 01:28:26,750
Fine.

1347
01:28:31,708 --> 01:28:33,208
We have to do it today, right?

1348
01:28:34,708 --> 01:28:36,875
Wake me up early,
and we'll have a quickie.

1349
01:28:44,208 --> 01:28:46,166
Hey. What's wrong?

1350
01:28:47,291 --> 01:28:49,291
You scared me saying it was urgent.

1351
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:51,333
Are you okay?

1352
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:58,625
Wanna get married?

1353
01:29:25,916 --> 01:29:26,958
Bonjour, Clément?

1354
01:29:28,458 --> 01:29:31,875
Uh, yes, yes. But I still have, um,
three days to decide you told me?

1355
01:29:32,375 --> 01:29:35,000
Okay. Um, I'll let you know
on Monday for sure.

1356
01:29:35,083 --> 01:29:37,000
I'm still organizing a few things.

1357
01:29:37,083 --> 01:29:37,916
Yeah.

1358
01:29:38,416 --> 01:29:40,458
Me… Merci. Merci beaucoup.

1359
01:29:53,166 --> 01:29:54,833
This job isn't that bad.

1360
01:29:55,916 --> 01:29:56,833
Look at all this.

1361
01:29:57,333 --> 01:30:00,083
Maca! Maca!

1362
01:30:00,166 --> 01:30:02,250
Where did you put my eggplant belt?

1363
01:30:02,333 --> 01:30:04,500
Why can't I ever find anything in here?

1364
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,041
Coming!

1365
01:30:15,791 --> 01:30:17,708
I've gotten a job offer.

1366
01:30:18,791 --> 01:30:21,041
It's a position at a very good magazine.

1367
01:30:21,958 --> 01:30:22,958
Seriously?

1368
01:30:23,041 --> 01:30:24,375
It's a great opportunity.

1369
01:30:25,625 --> 01:30:27,291
You're very talented, Macarena.

1370
01:30:27,375 --> 01:30:30,125
-I know, but--
-But working for Pipa is pointless.

1371
01:30:30,208 --> 01:30:31,458
But there's, um…

1372
01:30:32,125 --> 01:30:33,708
I'm so very proud of you.

1373
01:30:40,083 --> 01:30:41,000
I love you.

1374
01:30:42,250 --> 01:30:43,291
Love you too.

1375
01:32:11,875 --> 01:32:13,208
Hi.

1376
01:32:13,708 --> 01:32:14,583
Hey, gorgeous.

1377
01:32:15,333 --> 01:32:17,458
I bought you some folic acid.
It's in the kitchen.

1378
01:32:17,541 --> 01:32:19,750
Hey, I asked at work
about the paternity leave,

1379
01:32:19,833 --> 01:32:21,250
and it won't be an issue.

1380
01:32:21,333 --> 01:32:24,291
You'll see. Everything is going perfectly.

1381
01:32:29,208 --> 01:32:30,041
What?

1382
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:32,875
Jime, um…

1383
01:32:33,375 --> 01:32:34,458
This is going really fast

1384
01:32:34,541 --> 01:32:38,041
and I need to tell you something
that's super important.

1385
01:32:39,166 --> 01:32:41,583
What if we try it
without the whole spirit thing?

1386
01:32:42,166 --> 01:32:43,125
Huh?

1387
01:32:46,083 --> 01:32:47,375
'Cause I'm not Santi.

1388
01:32:48,791 --> 01:32:52,791
Your friends paid me to pretend
to be him and then say goodbye to you.

1389
01:32:52,875 --> 01:32:54,500
S-So you could finally let Santi go.

1390
01:32:55,416 --> 01:32:59,083
Then I started having feelings for you.
I'm sorry, but I didn't wanna lie to you.

1391
01:32:59,166 --> 01:33:01,750
I'm an idiot. There. I've said it.

1392
01:33:01,833 --> 01:33:04,041
And they told you what he liked
and whatnot?

1393
01:33:04,916 --> 01:33:06,666
What a pair of bitches, right?

1394
01:33:06,750 --> 01:33:09,250
I hate eggnog and fucking hobbits.

1395
01:33:09,916 --> 01:33:10,916
Yeah. Me too.

1396
01:33:14,125 --> 01:33:15,208
I swear.

1397
01:33:16,333 --> 01:33:18,208
-And this is all a lie too.
-Wow.

1398
01:33:18,291 --> 01:33:20,625
I can't fucking wait
to get rid of this shit.

1399
01:33:21,708 --> 01:33:22,666
So, you're an actor?

1400
01:33:22,750 --> 01:33:24,166
Well, yes. That's true.

1401
01:33:27,416 --> 01:33:28,333
Hey.

1402
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:30,750
I really like you.

1403
01:33:32,083 --> 01:33:34,208
-Do you still wanna marry me?
-Uh…

1404
01:33:35,583 --> 01:33:37,166
I really like you too, but I'm…

1405
01:33:37,875 --> 01:33:39,708
I'd rather be friends with you.

1406
01:33:39,791 --> 01:33:42,208
It's just… Look. I-I… I have to go now,

1407
01:33:42,291 --> 01:33:46,125
but i-i-if you wanna be friends with me,
then I'm up for it. Okay?

1408
01:33:46,208 --> 01:33:49,291
Um, who knows? You can call me anytime,

1409
01:33:49,375 --> 01:33:51,125
and then I will pick it up,

1410
01:33:51,208 --> 01:33:52,833
and maybe we'll plan something.

1411
01:33:53,375 --> 01:33:55,375
I don't know. We'll take it from there.

1412
01:33:57,500 --> 01:34:01,125
I have to go do something
really important. Sorry.

1413
01:34:01,958 --> 01:34:02,958
I'm fine!

1414
01:34:05,083 --> 01:34:05,916
See you!

1415
01:34:09,416 --> 01:34:11,666
That's great.
Jimena, Samuel's with a patient.

1416
01:34:25,125 --> 01:34:27,083
It's okay, Victoria. Just relax.

1417
01:34:34,416 --> 01:34:36,291
-Ugh.
-No, no. Don't worry about it.

1418
01:34:36,375 --> 01:34:37,875
Should we turn on some music?

1419
01:34:47,583 --> 01:34:50,375
DRINKS?

1420
01:35:32,250 --> 01:35:33,791
Two steps forward, one up.

1421
01:35:34,291 --> 01:35:35,791
Perfect. You're almost there.

1422
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:41,000
All right. Wait. I'm closing the door.

1423
01:35:42,458 --> 01:35:43,500
Now, straight ahead.

1424
01:35:46,666 --> 01:35:47,666
There. That's it.

1425
01:35:49,333 --> 01:35:51,333
Wait. Little more to the right.

1426
01:35:53,708 --> 01:35:54,916
A bit further.

1427
01:35:55,791 --> 01:35:56,750
Little more.

1428
01:35:57,541 --> 01:35:58,500
Here.

1429
01:35:58,583 --> 01:36:00,041
-Ready?
-Yeah.

1430
01:36:13,791 --> 01:36:15,125
Nothing's changed.

1431
01:36:19,541 --> 01:36:21,583
But why are we here?

1432
01:36:26,125 --> 01:36:26,958
Remember?

1433
01:36:30,458 --> 01:36:33,625
The photo from my swimming pool ID.

1434
01:36:33,708 --> 01:36:35,958
You took it
on our second date. Remember?

1435
01:36:36,041 --> 01:36:37,666
Yeah.

1436
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:39,375
I've always carried it with me…

1437
01:36:40,916 --> 01:36:43,291
because I've always been
in love with you, Maca.

1438
01:36:44,416 --> 01:36:45,875
This time I won't let you go.

1439
01:36:47,333 --> 01:36:48,458
I know you so well…

1440
01:36:51,208 --> 01:36:53,500
and at the same time,
it's like I've just met you.

1441
01:36:54,541 --> 01:36:55,500
Maca…

1442
01:36:58,458 --> 01:37:00,625
I want us to live together in this house.

1443
01:37:02,958 --> 01:37:05,208
I wanna wake up every day
with you beside me.

1444
01:37:07,750 --> 01:37:09,541
And I want…

1445
01:37:10,291 --> 01:37:13,375
I want us to have breakfast
on this balcony every morning.

1446
01:37:17,541 --> 01:37:20,333
We'll have breakfast
on that balcony every morning.

1447
01:37:23,291 --> 01:37:24,375
All this light.

1448
01:37:25,916 --> 01:37:27,625
It's so nice. I love it.

1449
01:37:29,666 --> 01:37:32,041
And right here, we could have a studio.

1450
01:37:32,625 --> 01:37:34,916
I don't know. I guess things
will be tight for a while,

1451
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,125
but it'll all be worth it
when you think about it.

1452
01:37:38,583 --> 01:37:41,500
-So that's a yes?
-But what about the scholarship?

1453
01:37:42,375 --> 01:37:45,458
You're afraid of commitment. You know it.
Why are you saying this to her?

1454
01:37:45,541 --> 01:37:47,958
-I'll tell them to hold it for us.
-Okay.

1455
01:37:49,458 --> 01:37:50,458
What are you doing?

1456
01:37:51,916 --> 01:37:53,625
You're being so inconsiderate.

1457
01:37:55,375 --> 01:37:57,916
The past version of you
doesn't seem to be upset.

1458
01:37:59,875 --> 01:38:00,833
Why, Leo?

1459
01:38:01,958 --> 01:38:04,250
Why don't you tell me everything
when I get off the phone?

1460
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,041
Why don't you mention the scholarship?

1461
01:38:08,125 --> 01:38:10,208
We could've gone together, the two of us.

1462
01:38:12,250 --> 01:38:14,583
Maca, leaving doesn't mean
I'm not madly in love with you.

1463
01:38:14,666 --> 01:38:17,458
I'm asking you
why you're not honest, though.

1464
01:38:23,333 --> 01:38:24,458
Because I'm scared.

1465
01:38:25,750 --> 01:38:28,166
-Of what?
-I guess, losing it all.

1466
01:38:33,916 --> 01:38:35,500
Think I'll get the scholarship?

1467
01:38:44,333 --> 01:38:46,041
You needed to go alone.

1468
01:38:47,708 --> 01:38:48,833
Isn't that true?

1469
01:38:50,166 --> 01:38:52,666
Isn't that
what you couldn't tell me that day?

1470
01:38:57,541 --> 01:38:59,166
Now I think I get it, Leo.

1471
01:39:02,166 --> 01:39:04,208
She can't get it, but I'm able to.

1472
01:39:05,166 --> 01:39:08,250
So we've checked everything out and it's…

1473
01:39:08,333 --> 01:39:09,250
Tell her.

1474
01:39:10,958 --> 01:39:11,958
Uh-huh. Yes.

1475
01:39:12,041 --> 01:39:13,791
Can't you see how excited she is?

1476
01:39:13,875 --> 01:39:15,875
We love the apartment, and…

1477
01:39:15,958 --> 01:39:17,625
You're gonna break her heart.

1478
01:39:21,250 --> 01:39:22,708
Okay. We'll definitely…

1479
01:39:22,791 --> 01:39:23,666
Just tell her.

1480
01:39:23,750 --> 01:39:26,625
…information you need
by tomorrow and I guess, thank you.

1481
01:39:26,708 --> 01:39:28,166
No problem. Thank you.

1482
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,375
I'm so happy.

1483
01:39:57,708 --> 01:40:00,291
The job offer's in Paris
and I'm going to accept it.

1484
01:40:01,625 --> 01:40:02,458
In Paris?

1485
01:40:05,791 --> 01:40:07,666
You could come with me if you'd like.

1486
01:40:14,625 --> 01:40:17,000
And… and what about my classes?

1487
01:40:17,958 --> 01:40:19,458
I know. I understand.

1488
01:40:23,708 --> 01:40:24,708
Maca, um…

1489
01:40:26,583 --> 01:40:28,750
is… is this because of Boston?

1490
01:40:30,583 --> 01:40:31,625
No, Leo.

1491
01:40:33,875 --> 01:40:36,375
For the first time,
it has nothing to do with you.

1492
01:41:26,791 --> 01:41:29,250
What I'm doing is very important.

1493
01:41:29,333 --> 01:41:31,250
So, yes. Let them know.

1494
01:41:31,333 --> 01:41:33,083
It's great. It's marvelous.

1495
01:41:33,583 --> 01:41:36,833
Macarena, you weren't invited.
What are you doing here?

1496
01:41:36,916 --> 01:41:38,291
-I'm going.
-Uh, where?

1497
01:41:38,375 --> 01:41:40,666
Working for you has been
a total fucking nightmare.

1498
01:41:41,750 --> 01:41:44,000
You are absolutely cold and insufferable.

1499
01:41:44,083 --> 01:41:45,083
And, darling,

1500
01:41:45,958 --> 01:41:48,083
you will never be a role model to anyone.

1501
01:41:48,166 --> 01:41:49,708
-Aw.
-Maca, stop it.

1502
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:51,416
What's she doing?

1503
01:41:55,708 --> 01:41:56,541
Cheers.

1504
01:41:57,541 --> 01:41:59,875
And that'll be that. You're fired!

1505
01:42:18,791 --> 01:42:19,666
Hey, you.

1506
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:22,833
I've called both of you,
but you didn't pick up.

1507
01:42:22,916 --> 01:42:24,583
And I know you called me before

1508
01:42:24,666 --> 01:42:27,458
and I was the one who didn't pick up,
so we're all assholes.

1509
01:42:28,583 --> 01:42:29,458
So, um,

1510
01:42:30,541 --> 01:42:34,875
I just wanted to let you know
that I'm moving to Paris.

1511
01:42:35,375 --> 01:42:36,291
Yup.

1512
01:42:37,708 --> 01:42:40,958
I got a job
at a magazine that's incredible.

1513
01:42:41,625 --> 01:42:44,416
And, um, I broke up with Leo.

1514
01:42:45,625 --> 01:42:47,583
Even though our relationship
was going well,

1515
01:42:48,083 --> 01:42:49,583
it's not the time to think about that.

1516
01:42:49,666 --> 01:42:51,833
And I am thinking about you two.

1517
01:42:51,916 --> 01:42:55,875
And I don't care if you wanna have kids
or if you're into dating the dead.

1518
01:42:55,958 --> 01:42:57,291
I love you anyway.

1519
01:42:57,875 --> 01:43:00,375
So, I really hope
that you're both proud of me.

1520
01:43:00,875 --> 01:43:03,958
I made it. I'm where I wanna be.

1521
01:43:04,041 --> 01:43:05,875
And I wish you the same.

1522
01:43:05,958 --> 01:43:08,333
I want you to have
whatever you might want.

1523
01:43:19,166 --> 01:43:20,083
So, hi.

1524
01:43:20,666 --> 01:43:22,041
Hmm. Come in.

1525
01:43:22,541 --> 01:43:24,416
Remember that we are much more

1526
01:43:24,500 --> 01:43:27,125
than the right or wrong choices
that we make.

1527
01:43:27,208 --> 01:43:28,333
Ow.

1528
01:43:28,416 --> 01:43:30,583
And that we made it
this far together.

1529
01:43:32,125 --> 01:43:35,333
I hope I can learn to be alone.
It doesn't scare me anymore.

1530
01:43:36,083 --> 01:43:37,541
But I know it'll be hard.

1531
01:43:38,958 --> 01:43:41,375
Whenever I feel sad,
I know I can call you.

1532
01:43:41,458 --> 01:43:43,041
And I hope you both visit me.

1533
01:43:43,875 --> 01:43:45,083
I love you so much.

1534
01:43:47,833 --> 01:43:49,208
And I already miss you.

1535
01:44:04,208 --> 01:44:05,041
Salut.

1536
01:44:06,583 --> 01:44:07,708
Bonjour.

1537
01:44:14,750 --> 01:44:17,500
Here, I see myself the way I am,

1538
01:44:18,333 --> 01:44:21,208
the way I want to be,
not the way other people think of me.

1539
01:44:21,875 --> 01:44:23,708
I am proud of who I am.

1540
01:44:23,791 --> 01:44:24,875
Even in this hat.

1541
01:44:26,791 --> 01:44:29,833
WE MISS YOU!

1542
01:44:29,916 --> 01:44:31,750
Un selfie pour mes amis espagnol?

1543
01:44:31,833 --> 01:44:32,666
Oui.

1544
01:44:36,916 --> 01:44:37,916
O, bien.

1545
01:44:39,041 --> 01:44:40,250
C'est tres belle.

1546
01:44:45,875 --> 01:44:49,750
There was so many things missing
in my life when I got that job offer.

1547
01:44:49,833 --> 01:44:53,375
But now I've embraced my past,
my present, and my future.

1548
01:44:55,666 --> 01:44:58,125
Now I know that love shouldn't hurt.

1549
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,875
Now I know that first
you need to learn to love yourself.

1550
01:45:05,833 --> 01:45:08,791
And only then will you be ready to love

1551
01:45:10,250 --> 01:45:12,541
and share your life with someone else.

1552
01:45:17,791 --> 01:45:18,875
Wait a second.

1553
01:45:18,958 --> 01:45:23,041
If this were a romantic comedy,
this would be the ending.
