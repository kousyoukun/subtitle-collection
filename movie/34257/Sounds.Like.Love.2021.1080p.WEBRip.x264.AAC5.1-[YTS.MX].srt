is freaking crazy.

1027
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:13,333
Oh yeah. Um, Santi broke his wrist
three times skating.

1028
00:55:13,916 --> 00:55:15,625
-Yeah.
-Would that work for you?

1029
00:55:15,708 --> 00:55:17,625
But why would she believe any of this?

1030
00:55:17,708 --> 00:55:20,708
Well, logic and Jime have been
in a complicated relationship

1031
00:55:20,791 --> 00:55:21,750
for 15 years.

1032
00:55:22,708 --> 00:55:25,583
She'll believe you're Santi.
Then you'll say goodbye to her forever.

1033
00:55:25,666 --> 00:55:27,708
Um, you'll liberate her.

1034
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:30,500
And you'll help a wonderful cause.

1035
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:33,333
Actors like to do that stuff. Don't they?

1036
00:55:34,416 --> 00:55:37,750
Yeah. But what if she asks me something
that hasn't been written down?

1037
00:55:38,333 --> 00:55:39,208
Improvise.

1038
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,000
And you know that being an actor
is really going to help you.

1039
00:55:43,083 --> 00:55:44,333
It'll be super easy.

1040
00:55:44,416 --> 00:55:47,041
You have two dates
and then you'll be all done.

1041
00:55:47,916 --> 00:55:50,166
Well? What is this gonna cost?

1042
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:52,458
Oh man. I really hate eggnog.

1043
00:55:54,166 --> 00:55:57,083
Well, it's absolutely essential
that you like eggnog.

1044
00:55:57,166 --> 00:56:00,125
Well then, the eggnog will cost extra.

1045
00:56:02,041 --> 00:56:03,875
My favorite is the second one.

1046
00:56:03,958 --> 00:56:06,000
Well, my favorite is the last one.

1047
00:56:06,083 --> 00:56:07,958
I know most people love The Two Towers,

1048
00:56:08,041 --> 00:56:11,083
but I just watched them, like,
20 times lately, and now I'm sure of it.

1049
00:56:11,166 --> 00:56:13,500
Hey, you never used to care about Tolkien.

1050
00:56:13,583 --> 00:56:16,166
My tastes have completely changed.
It's incredible.

1051
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:17,375
And since when?

1052
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:21,416
Um, I don't know.
I'd say about two months or so.

1053
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:22,500
The powder.

1054
00:56:22,583 --> 00:56:25,500
And then your name just started popping
into my head, like, all the time.

1055
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:28,250
"Jime Herrera. Jime Herrera."
So, I had to find you.

1056
00:56:28,333 --> 00:56:29,625
You must think I'm crazy.

1057
00:56:29,708 --> 00:56:32,750
-[tutting] Oh my God. No.
-Mm.

1058
00:56:34,041 --> 00:56:35,958
And what happened to your wrist?

1059
00:56:36,625 --> 00:56:37,916
Oh yeah. That.

1060
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,750
I mean, the thing is that all of a sudden
I felt the need to hop on a skateboard.

1061
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:45,125
I bought one and look what happened.
Triple fracture.

1062
00:56:45,875 --> 00:56:47,500
Can I ask you something else?

1063
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:48,875
Yeah. Sure.

1064
00:56:48,958 --> 00:56:51,291
A band, a city, a type of cheese,

1065
00:56:51,375 --> 00:56:53,916
an animal you hate,
and an episode of The Simpsons.

1066
00:56:54,708 --> 00:56:56,166
Wow. Okay.

1067
00:56:56,791 --> 00:56:58,291
Um… Let's see.

1068
00:56:58,375 --> 00:56:59,833
A band? Slipknot.

1069
00:57:01,625 --> 00:57:02,708
Uh, Edinburgh.

1070
00:57:03,208 --> 00:57:04,333
Emmental.

1071
00:57:04,916 --> 00:57:08,166
-Um, the Pinchy episode of The Simpsons.
-Love that one!

1072
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:11,291
And… Oh, and fucking rodents. I hate them.

1073
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:23,583
Where the hell did they hide you?

[Leo] Maca.

1078
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:43,583
Maca.

1079
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,958
I just want to apologize.

1080
00:57:52,875 --> 00:57:55,083
Not just for what happened
in my office, but…

1081
00:57:57,083 --> 00:57:58,208
for everything else.

1082
00:57:59,583 --> 00:58:01,583
I mean, I left with no explanation.

1083
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:03,958
It was all wrong.

1084
00:58:04,958 --> 00:58:05,791
Wrong and…

1085
00:58:06,291 --> 00:58:10,125
and I'm really sorry because I didn't mean
to hurt you. I swear.

1086
00:58:17,583 --> 00:58:19,833
You seemed pretty convinced
of your decision.

1087
00:58:21,083 --> 00:58:21,916
No.

1088
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:24,458
No, Maca, it was really hard for me

1089
00:58:24,958 --> 00:58:28,541
to live my life without having you
always by my side, driving me crazy.

1090
00:58:31,333 --> 00:58:32,333
I'm so sorry.

1091

[emotional music playing]

1092
00:58:35,833 --> 00:58:36,958
I really mean it.

1093
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:44,250
Could we be friends?

1094
00:58:57,041 --> 00:58:57,958
Okay.

1095
00:59:09,083 --> 00:59:10,250
[doorbell rings]

1096
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,166
What are you doing?

1097
00:59:15,291 --> 00:59:16,666
Complicating my life.

["Dancing to the Radio"
by Adanowsky playing]

1099
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:28,708
[Maca] I got to have
a say on the guest list,

1100
00:59:28,791 --> 00:59:30,541
so, naturally Raquel was invited.

1101
00:59:31,375 --> 00:59:33,250
I even added a plus-one for her.

1102
00:59:33,875 --> 00:59:35,333
But, of course, I hope it isn't Leo.

1103
00:59:35,416 --> 00:59:39,000
Even though he apologized to me,
I really don't wanna see him right now.

1104
00:59:40,958 --> 00:59:41,833
[Pipa] Maca!

1105
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:49,875
Maca, call Mateo.
My ponytail's coming undone.

1106
00:59:49,958 --> 00:59:51,958
-Do you want me to fix it?
-No. Call Mateo.

1107
00:59:52,041 --> 00:59:52,916
Got it. I'll call him.

1108
00:59:56,708 --> 00:59:58,833
Mateo, Mateo, Mateo.

1109
00:59:58,916 --> 00:59:59,750
[Raquel] Maca!

1110
01:00:00,916 --> 01:00:03,291
-[Maca] Hey. Hi.
-Is this your bag now?

1111
01:00:03,375 --> 01:00:05,500
It was a gift from Pipa. From Milan.

1112
01:00:05,583 --> 01:00:08,750
She felt bad about the other event.
She's not so bad.

1113
01:00:09,833 --> 01:00:11,791
Sweetheart, I was there
when they gave it to her.

1114
01:00:11,875 --> 01:00:12,916
She said she didn't want it

1115
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,791
because it had been touched
by too many people.

1116

[scoffs]

It's just… the stress
just makes me want to lose it.

No. It's okay.

1119
01:00:25,375 --> 01:00:29,333
Raquel, I'm… I'm really sorry
for what I said the other day about Leo.

1120
01:00:30,541 --> 01:00:31,791
Um, it's no problem.

1121
01:00:32,333 --> 01:00:35,041
The truth is, we've made an effort
to improve our communication,

1122
01:00:35,125 --> 01:00:36,666
and it's actually working.

1123
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:37,583
I'm glad.

1124
01:00:38,166 --> 01:00:39,708
Why don't we all go out to dinner?

1125
01:00:39,791 --> 01:00:42,958
-No.
-Yeah. We can consider it a new beginning.

1126
01:00:44,958 --> 01:00:46,916
Is it time to act like a grown-up?

1127
01:00:48,625 --> 01:00:51,125
-Of course.
-Or bring a date if you like.

1128
01:00:51,916 --> 01:00:53,291
Well, I'll tell my boyfriend.

1129
01:00:53,875 --> 01:00:55,708
-Oh.
-[Maca] I have to call the hairdresser.

1130
01:00:55,791 --> 01:00:56,833
It's for Pipa.

1131
01:00:57,333 --> 01:00:58,416
See you around.

1132
01:00:58,500 --> 01:00:59,833
-Okay. Ciao.
-[Maca] Ciao.

You can't run away from him all your life.

He apologized, you've calmed down,
you haven't lost it.

1135
01:01:11,166 --> 01:01:12,583
You can be friends with a guy.

1136
01:01:12,666 --> 01:01:14,500
Friends? What are you saying?

1137
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,333
That's all I need to hear.

ARE YOU MAD AT ME?
DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG?

1146
01:01:41,125 --> 01:01:43,916
Hey. Would you like to go
to an exhibition on Friday?

1147
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,041
The Reina Sofía museum
has an interesting one

1148
01:01:46,125 --> 01:01:47,958
that I've been meaning to see
before it leaves.

1149
01:01:48,458 --> 01:01:50,958
Uh… Yeah. I don't know.

1150
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,333
I was thinking I'd come back here.

1151
01:01:53,416 --> 01:01:55,291
-To the skate park?
-Sure.

1152
01:01:55,375 --> 01:01:58,541
But neither of us has any idea
what we're doing on a skateboard.

1153
01:01:58,625 --> 01:02:02,541
Pfft. Sure. But I just like being
around here with these guys.

1154
01:02:02,625 --> 01:02:04,083
Santi loved to do that.

1155
01:02:04,166 --> 01:02:07,291
Besides, I thought I'd buy some good weed
and get nice buzz. Know what I mean?

01:02:07,375 --> 01:02:10,041
Oof. Joints don't go well
with me anymore, Jorge.

Remember, we love each other
and we're happy.

1162
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,750
We're moving in together,
and you are very intelligent.

1163
01:02:36,833 --> 01:02:37,666
Okay.

1164
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:42,125
We are looking for an apartment
around La Latina or Barrio de las Letras.

1165
01:02:42,208 --> 01:02:44,083
[Raquel] Mm, I love those neighborhoods.

1166
01:02:44,166 --> 01:02:46,291
But we are thinking
about moving to the countryside.

1167
01:02:46,375 --> 01:02:47,500
I mean, aren't we?

1168
01:02:47,583 --> 01:02:49,041
-Yep.
-[Maca] The countryside?

1169
01:02:49,125 --> 01:02:52,208
But Leo wears repellent every time
he goes past the city limits.

1170
01:02:53,208 --> 01:02:56,625
I'd say it's about time he made friends
with the earth mother. Right?

1171
01:02:56,708 --> 01:02:59,750
-He'll reconnect with the earth mother.
-Earth mother.

1172
01:02:59,833 --> 01:03:00,666
You really should.

1173
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:03,166
The truth is that the air quality
in the city's unbearable.

1174
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:05,541
[Raquel] Hmm.
Well, then if you're moving to La Latina…

1175
01:03:06,041 --> 01:03:07,041
[Leo] Thank you.

1176
01:03:07,125 --> 01:03:10,166
-[Maca] Mm.
-Mm. I take my lead from Maca.

1177
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:17,750
Um… So, Coque, what do you do, exactly?

1178
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:19,708
Aside from getting really nice tattoos.

1179
01:03:20,333 --> 01:03:22,583
Thank you. Well, a bit of everything.

1180
01:03:22,666 --> 01:03:23,916
DJ, podcasts, monologues…

1181
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,125
-Monologues?
-[Coque] Yes.

1182
01:03:25,208 --> 01:03:27,416
Apartment prices
really have plummeted downtown, huh?

1183
01:03:28,375 --> 01:03:29,833
And what are your monologues about?

1184
01:03:29,916 --> 01:03:33,291
-Raquel, how's the urban garden project?
-Wait. Don't tell me. Don't tell me.

1185
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,708
About millennial fucking.

1186
01:03:35,666 --> 01:03:36,500
You've been to one?

1187
01:03:37,583 --> 01:03:39,625
It's cool you do so many things, Coque.

1188
01:03:39,708 --> 01:03:42,750
[Leo] Indeed. And they say
there are no entrepreneurs anymore.

1189
01:03:42,833 --> 01:03:44,250
-A toast.
-You sound like an old man.

1190
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:45,250
[Coque] Salud.

1191
01:03:45,333 --> 01:03:47,083
I am an old man, in spirit.

1192
01:03:47,166 --> 01:03:48,083
I know. I know.

1193
01:03:48,166 --> 01:03:51,000
You've been wearing smoking jackets
at home since you were ten, right?

1194
01:03:51,083 --> 01:03:52,208
That's crazy.

1195
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:54,958
-[Leo chuckles]
-Really freaking crazy.

1196
01:03:55,041 --> 01:03:57,958
-I'm sure you still wear them.
-No. Do you know what's crazy?

1197
01:03:58,041 --> 01:04:00,416
What's crazy is that we don't know
where my smoking jacket is

1198
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,375
because it disappeared, mysteriously.

1199
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:04,083
Um…

1200
01:04:04,166 --> 01:04:05,958
No. You can finally confess.
It's been a while.

1201
01:04:06,041 --> 01:04:07,375
-No. It…
-Where's the jacket?

1202
01:04:07,458 --> 01:04:09,666
Oh, don't ask me.
It must be in the same place as…

1203
01:04:10,833 --> 01:04:11,833
Now wait a minute.

1204
01:04:13,083 --> 01:04:14,333
Oh, that thing.

1205
01:04:14,416 --> 01:04:17,166
-Yeah.
-[Leo] I totally forgot! Are you for real?

1206
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:18,791
-No. Not there.
-[Leo] In the same place?

1207
01:04:18,875 --> 01:04:20,916
Yes. Yes.

1208
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,666
-[Maca laughing] No.
-[Leo] Yes.

1209
01:04:23,458 --> 01:04:24,916
Do you know why I thought you hid it?

1210
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,416
Do you remember the day your mom
brought the lasagna, I think it was?

1211
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,666
-It had meat in it?
-What… what about the urban gardens?

1212
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:32,375
I'm really interested in all that, Raquel.

1213
01:04:32,458 --> 01:04:35,291
Because we both want
an apartment with a balcony.

1214
01:04:35,833 --> 01:04:37,458
It's important. A balcony.

1215
01:04:40,916 --> 01:04:44,291
[Leo] I don't know. I didn't, uh,
think it'd be someone like him.

1216
01:04:44,375 --> 01:04:46,083
[Maca] You can't judge a book
by its cover.

1217
01:04:46,166 --> 01:04:48,000
-Yeah.
-Raquel liked him.

1218
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,583
Because Raquel is charming with everyone.

1219
01:04:52,083 --> 01:04:55,125
-So is it true you're moving in together?
-Why wouldn't it be?

1220
01:04:55,208 --> 01:04:58,958
I don't know, Maca. I don't… I don't know
if he's the right one for you.

1221
01:05:00,208 --> 01:05:01,666
And who is the right one for me?

1222
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,416
[Raquel] Oh, DJ. So interesting.

1223
01:05:04,916 --> 01:05:07,375
That's great. Yeah. Please let us know.

1224
01:05:08,375 --> 01:05:09,458
Hey.

1225
01:05:09,541 --> 01:05:11,416
-Shall we go?
-Yeah. Let's go.

1226
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:14,000
-We should do this again sometime. Yeah?
-[Leo] Yes. Well…

1227
01:05:14,083 --> 01:05:15,125
-[Raquel] Soon?
-[Leo] Soon.

1228
01:05:15,208 --> 01:05:16,458
-[Maca] Yeah.
-Oh yeah.

1229
01:05:17,208 --> 01:05:18,666
-Ciao.
-Ciao.

1230
01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:21,875
-[Coque] It went well, right?
-[Maca] You want a drink?

1231
01:05:26,291 --> 01:05:27,125
[cell phone chimes]

1232
01:05:27,208 --> 01:05:29,250
Hey, Adriana. Let's grab some lunch.

1233
01:05:29,333 --> 01:05:31,625
I'm mixed up about Leo.
Well, I mean… I'm not saying…

1234
01:05:31,708 --> 01:05:35,208
What I mean is I need to talk to you,
and you're the most sensible of us.

1235
01:05:35,291 --> 01:05:37,875
I'll come by your shop
and we'll talk, okay? Later.

1236
01:05:41,125 --> 01:05:42,625
[indistinct chatter]

1237
01:05:54,916 --> 01:05:56,666
[upbeat jazz music playing]

1238
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:57,583
[Adriana] You see?

1239
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:03,166
Come on.

1240
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:10,833
[Pipa] Maca!

1241
01:06:14,666 --> 01:06:15,916
-Stunning.
-[Pipa] Hmm?

1242
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:19,166
Before leaving, remember
to organize my bags too. Okay?

1243
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:20,583
I have to go. I have a date.

1244
01:06:20,666 --> 01:06:22,833
If you hurry up,
you'll finish before eight today.

1245
01:06:23,625 --> 01:06:25,791
-Okay. Have fun.
-Thanks, darling.

1246
01:06:28,125 --> 01:06:29,125
[cell phone chimes]

1247
01:06:32,458 --> 01:06:35,666
MACA, I'M PASSING YOUR CV AROUND.

1248
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:37,708
I'LL KEEP YOU POSTED.

1249
01:06:45,125 --> 01:06:45,958
Hey there.

1250
01:06:47,541 --> 01:06:48,791
How do you know where I work?

1251
01:06:49,375 --> 01:06:50,791
Well, I did some research.

1252
01:06:52,291 --> 01:06:53,125
Wow.

1253
01:06:53,625 --> 01:06:54,875
I'm sorry.

1254
01:06:55,625 --> 01:06:57,708
Lately, he can't stop with the apologies.

1255
01:06:58,875 --> 01:07:00,166
I like it, okay?

1256
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:02,166
How about dinner?

1257
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:03,500
With Raquel?

1258
01:07:04,541 --> 01:07:06,333
As in, "I want her to come along."

1259
01:07:06,916 --> 01:07:08,166
No. It's just, the thing is,

1260
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:11,541
I'm writing an academic article
on love in contemporary literature, and…

1261
01:07:12,708 --> 01:07:14,916
and I'd love for you
to give me your opinion.

1262
01:07:17,208 --> 01:07:18,541
It has to be quick.

1263
01:07:18,625 --> 01:07:20,416
-At the bar, okay?
-Okay.

1264
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:28,458
[Maca] Generally speaking, I like it,
but… I don't know. Something is missing.

1265
01:07:28,541 --> 01:07:29,458
Like what?

1266
01:07:30,083 --> 01:07:32,750
You need to, um,
connect yourself emotionally.

1267
01:07:33,541 --> 01:07:36,125
There's only theory and analysis
of these stories,

1268
01:07:36,208 --> 01:07:37,750
but it's from a distance.

1269
01:07:37,833 --> 01:07:38,666
I see.

1270
01:07:39,166 --> 01:07:40,125
So what, then?

1271
01:07:41,375 --> 01:07:44,875
Look all around you,
not just in the pages of a book.

1272
01:07:45,958 --> 01:07:46,916
All around me?

1273
01:07:48,166 --> 01:07:50,791
Yeah. At the people everywhere.

1274
01:07:51,291 --> 01:07:54,333
At your own memories. At your experiences.

1275
01:07:55,458 --> 01:07:57,625
You know that observing my reality
and reflecting on it

1276
01:07:57,708 --> 01:07:59,166
is a little bit hard for me.

1277
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:00,333
[Leo chuckles]

1278
01:08:02,041 --> 01:08:03,416
Hey, should we eat something?

1279
01:08:04,041 --> 01:08:06,125
She's not replying to my texts either.

1280
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:09,125
Pipa must have her hooks in her again.

1281
01:08:09,875 --> 01:08:11,041
I'm sure that's true.

1282
01:08:11,958 --> 01:08:12,958
So how are you?

1283
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:15,208
Oh, pretty good.

1284
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:16,958
Or not.

1285
01:08:17,041 --> 01:08:19,875
Actually, I'm super great. Yeah.

1286
01:08:19,958 --> 01:08:21,750
Or even greater than super great.

1287
01:08:21,833 --> 01:08:22,833
Seriously?

1288
01:08:22,916 --> 01:08:24,541
Santi number two is…

1289
01:08:26,666 --> 01:08:29,125
I don't have words for how great he is.

1290
01:08:29,791 --> 01:08:32,208
Oh, but, uh… [chuckles]
He's still with you?

1291
01:08:32,291 --> 01:08:33,333
Yeah. Of course.

1292
01:08:34,083 --> 01:08:37,125
I spent forever looking for him.
Anyway, we better go.

1293
01:08:41,333 --> 01:08:44,208
JORGE, YOU DIDN'T BREAK UP WITH HER YET?

1294
01:08:44,291 --> 01:08:45,958
NO

1295
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:49,583
WHY?

1296
01:08:49,666 --> 01:08:52,041
I LOVE HER!

1297
01:08:52,541 --> 01:08:55,125
He's my man. Like Julián's yours.

1298
01:08:55,208 --> 01:08:57,541
[chuckles nervously] Hmm.

1299
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:02,875
-Jime.
-Yeah?

1300
01:09:06,333 --> 01:09:09,041
I have a 50% discount
on wedding dresses, if you want.

1301
01:09:10,708 --> 01:09:12,250
-Interested?
-There's a plan.

1302
01:09:12,333 --> 01:09:13,833
-Right?
-We'll throw a wedding party

1303
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:15,041
before you know it, right?

1304
01:09:15,125 --> 01:09:17,000
-[Jime] Come on. Let's go.
-Okay.

1305
01:09:18,083 --> 01:09:19,000
My God.

1306
01:09:20,958 --> 01:09:22,958
[Leo laughing]

1307
01:09:25,458 --> 01:09:27,250
-[Maca] It's weird.
-What is?

1308
01:09:28,041 --> 01:09:30,500
You're the same,
but you've also changed a lot.

1309
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:31,708
How so?

1310
01:09:33,958 --> 01:09:35,958
I guess you're more mature.

1311
01:09:36,041 --> 01:09:37,666
[chuckles]

1312
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:40,916
I don't know.
I feel like it would be different now.

1313
01:09:43,375 --> 01:09:45,416
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not insinuating anything.

1314
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:46,541
Oh yeah. Yeah.

1315
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:53,041
The thing is, Raquel's happy,
and you look so serene,

1316
01:09:53,125 --> 01:09:55,541
that I don't identify it
with what we were at all.

1317
01:09:56,666 --> 01:09:59,833
Maca, what we had, you and me,
was really special.

1318
01:10:01,291 --> 01:10:02,833
We were happy too. Remember?

1319
01:10:04,666 --> 01:10:07,166
I don't know. At least I have
good memories from back then.

1320
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:08,083
Yeah.

1321
01:10:08,166 --> 01:10:10,166
[emotional music playing]

1322
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:15,666
I want you to think about what we had as…
as an amazing time, Maca.

1323
01:10:16,166 --> 01:10:19,875
I know we went through a lot of hardship,
but it was incredible.

1324
01:10:21,291 --> 01:10:23,208
And it has helped us
become who we are today.

1325
01:10:24,625 --> 01:10:26,041
I don't know who I am.

1326
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,375
You're a fantastic woman,

1327
01:10:32,208 --> 01:10:33,833
and a smoking jacket thief,

1328
01:10:34,791 --> 01:10:35,625
stubborn,

1329
01:10:37,083 --> 01:10:39,583
someone who's able
to start a riot in my own class…

1330
01:10:41,958 --> 01:10:43,833
whose eyes are amazing.

1331
01:10:47,541 --> 01:10:49,416
But mostly really stubborn.

1332
01:10:52,208 --> 01:10:54,208
[inaudible]

1333
01:11:17,791 --> 01:11:18,875
Check out this house.

1334
01:11:19,458 --> 01:11:23,083
It has water recycling,
a vegetable garden, solar panels.

1335
01:11:23,166 --> 01:11:24,541
[inhales deeply] I love it.

1336
01:11:25,916 --> 01:11:28,375
[sighs deeply]

1337
01:11:30,458 --> 01:11:32,875
Jime, I need to tell you something.

1338
01:11:32,958 --> 01:11:34,708
It's a message from Santi.

1339
01:11:37,458 --> 01:11:39,500
Jime, I have a message for you.

1340
01:11:39,583 --> 01:11:41,750
-[Jime] From Santi?
-[Jorge] Yeah.

1341
01:11:42,291 --> 01:11:44,791
Um… Well, I'm getting…

1342
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,583
that you are amazing,
and I enjoy spending time with you.

1343
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:55,000
I mean, we get each other.
Don't you believe it's true?

1344
01:11:55,083 --> 01:11:56,791
-Don't we laugh together?
-Totally.

1345
01:11:57,458 --> 01:12:00,125
It's his sense of humor
that connected me the most to Santi.

1346
01:12:00,958 --> 01:12:03,916
-But… but I'm funny too. Don't you think?
-I mean, to me.

1347
01:12:04,625 --> 01:12:05,708
[both laugh]

1348
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:10,333
Listen to this.

1349
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,666
"For it shows things that were,
and things that are,

1350
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:16,833
things that yet may be.
But which it is that he sees…"

1351
01:12:16,916 --> 01:12:19,291
[both] "…even the wisest
cannot always tell."

1352
01:12:19,375 --> 01:12:21,291
-The Lord of the Rings?
-Yeah.

1353
01:12:21,375 --> 01:12:22,583
That's it. That's it.

1354
01:12:25,666 --> 01:12:27,583
[ducks quacking]

1355
01:12:28,458 --> 01:12:29,416
[Adriana sighs]

1356
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:32,708
I'm so happy with you.

1357
01:12:32,791 --> 01:12:34,291
I feel the same.

1358
01:12:37,125 --> 01:12:39,166
[woman] But you can't go on
like this, Adriana.

1359
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:40,291
Yeah, I know.

1360
01:12:41,166 --> 01:12:42,583
I think about it all day.

1361
01:12:45,958 --> 01:12:46,958

this far together.

1870
01:43:32,125 --> 01:43:35,333
I hope I can learn to be alone.
It doesn't scare me anymore.

1871
01:43:36,083 --> 01:43:37,541
But I know it'll be hard.

1872
01:43:38,958 --> 01:43:41,375
Whenever I feel sad,
I know I can call you.

1873
01:43:41,458 --> 01:43:43,041
And I hope you both visit me.

1874
01:43:43,875 --> 01:43:45,083
I love you so much.

1875
01:43:47,833 --> 01:43:49,208
And I already miss you.

1876
01:43:51,625 --> 01:43:53,083
[cell phone chimes, clicks]

1877
01:43:55,583 --> 01:43:57,583
["Ma Soeur" by Clara Luciani playing]

1878
01:44:04,208 --> 01:44:05,041
Salut.

1879
01:44:06,583 --> 01:44:07,708
Bonjour.

1880
01:44:14,750 --> 01:44:17,500
Here, I see myself the way I am,

1881
01:44:18,333 --> 01:44:21,208
the way I want to be,
not the way other people think of me.

1882
01:44:21,875 --> 01:44:23,708
I am proud of who I am.

1883
01:44:23,791 --> 01:44:24,875
Even in this hat.

1884
01:44:26,791 --> 01:44:29,833
WE MISS YOU!

1885
01:44:29,916 --> 01:44:31,750
Un selfie pour mes amis espagnol?

1886
01:44:31,833 --> 01:44:32,666
Oui.

1887
01:44:36,916 --> 01:44:37,916
O, bien.

1888
01:44:39,041 --> 01:44:40,250
C'est tres belle.

1889
01:44:40,333 --> 01:44:42,250
[indistinct chatter]

1890
01:44:45,875 --> 01:44:49,750
[Maca] There was so many things missing
in my life when I got that job offer.

1891
01:44:49,833 --> 01:44:53,375
But now I've embraced my past,
my present, and my future.

1892
01:44:55,666 --> 01:44:58,125
Now I know that love shouldn't hurt.

1893
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,875
Now I know that first
you need to learn to love yourself.

1894
01:45:05,833 --> 01:45:08,791
And only then will you be ready to love

1895
01:45:10,250 --> 01:45:12,541
and share your life with someone else.

1896
01:45:16,083 --> 01:45:17,708
-[record scratching]

1897
01:45:17,791 --> 01:45:18,875
[Maca] Wait a second.

1898
01:45:18,958 --> 01:45:23,041
If this were a romantic comedy,
this would be the ending.

1899
01:45:24,166 --> 01:45:25,208
