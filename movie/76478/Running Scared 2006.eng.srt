1
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,020
(Gunshot)

2
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,150
Come on... Come on, kid!

3
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,110
Don't...

4
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,650
We're gonna make it. Fuck!

5
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,240
Come on, Oleg. Stay with me!

6
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,620
Come on!

7
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,710
We're gonna make it.

8
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,000
We're gonna crash!

9
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,050
We're good.

10
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,600
It's all looking very good.

11
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,150
Nobody fucking moves! Get down on the ground.

12
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,020
- Get down  - Now, you cocksuckers!

13
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,360
You heard him! Get down!

14
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,360
You're making the biggest mistake...

15
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,110
Shut up! Down, motherfuckers!

16
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,030
Everybody! Eat the fucking floor!

17
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,540
Now, very fucking carefully

18
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,250
reach into your jackets and take out whatever you're packing

19
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,380
and slide it under the bed.

20
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,840
Come on! All ofyou! Move it!

21
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,050
Come on, fuckheads! Keep it moving. Now!

22
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,300
You better spend it real quick, shit bags.

23
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,430
You ain't long for this fucking world.

24
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,350
Yeah, right, I'll be sure to have a Mai Tai on you.

25
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,560
On all you goombah fucks.

26
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,730
Ja, man. I'll have one on you too.

27
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,150
- Go, go, go! Come on!  - Move! Move! Move!

28
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,780
Hurry up! Get going! Move!

29
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,690
Let's go! Let's go!

30
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,400
Come on.

31
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,780
Come on. Now!

32
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,580
(Screams)

33
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,790
Motherfucker!

34
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,720
No, man.

35
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,800
We don't give a fuck about these niggers.

36
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,680
Now, you spill Perello blood, you're deep six invested.

37
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,810
Walk clean.

38
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,850
Piss on Perello blood. Fuck him!

39
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,650
I don't think so.

40
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,450
Son of a bitch!

41
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,140
(Shouting and screaming)

42
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,800
I don't give up, you fuck!

43
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:51,000
What?. Where you going, you fuck?. We can work this out. Let's talk.

44
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,040
Fuck you!

45
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,210
Shut...the fuck up!

46
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,970
Where the fuck you reaching?. Huh?.

47
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,090
Please...

48
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,760
Tell you what, have a Mai Tai on me, huh?.

49
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,420
(Shoots)

50
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,850
Fuck me. He's a cop!

51
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,270
A fucking cop!

52
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,320
Motherfucker!

53
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,440
Get the shit and let's go. Now!

54
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,860
Hurry the fuck up!

55
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,820
(Police siren wails)

56
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,700
Fucking dirty mooks.

57
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,080
Fuck's sakes.

58
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,250
Is there one fucking honest cop in this fucking city?.

59
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,420
Joey.

60
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,750
Give me your gun.

61
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,760
Take this shit and get rid of it, and do me a favour.

62
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,890
Don't fuck it up.

63
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,230
Move!

64
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,440
Never, dickwad!

65
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,620
Sorry. Are you OK?.

66
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,950
Oh, shit. I didn't mean to do that.

67
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,360
Hey, boss.

68
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,450
You whacking off to the E channel again?. Huh?.

69
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,780
(Door buzzer)

70
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,350
Just wanna smell you. Just like that.

71
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,110
You didn't call, you son of a bitch.

72
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,790
Let me guess. My pearls you've been promising?.

73
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,920
It's nothing, just a little recycling.

74
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,090
Joey, come on.

75
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,680
If Tommy ever found out about that...

76
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,970
Ssh.

77
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,100
Just remember, it's just our little insurance policy, all right?.

78
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,440
Cos there's no way in hell I'm gonna be thinking about getting some of this...

79
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,600
Iooking at you through some glass window. There's no fuckin' way.

80
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,100
Now, Joey, come on. No, no, no, no.

81
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,020
No. No!

82
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,930
Come on, baby. Baby, look at me.

83
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,480
- What?  - Nicky's around.

84
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,100
Nicky's busy. I'll be quick and real quiet, come on.

85
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,730
Quiet?. I don't think so. Quick, I can believe.

86
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,280
- You know something, Mrs G?  - What?.

87
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,360
You're bad.

88
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

89
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,080
- I've got a rep  - Yeah?. You got a rep?.

90
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,700
You got a cruisey rep?.

91
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,960
I heard she likes to make it on washing machines.

92
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,040
On select occasions. What else?.

93
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,340
Oh, no, no, no. My sauce!

94
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,920
- My sauce is burning!  - Wait, that's how I like it!

95
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,430
Yeah.

96
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,180
- Fuck! Come on!  - Hey!

97
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:22,230
You use language like that, you ain't getting no after-dinner dessert.

98
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,020
Go find Nicky. I think he's up in the bedroom with Oleg.

99
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,020
Why's he always with that Russky kid?. Don't he have no other friends?.

100
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:33,320
Joey, you know, they get along. It's fine. What do you want?.

101
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,280
I don't want him going over there no more. That's what I want.

102
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,410
I know. He knows.

103
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,620
He knows.

104
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,580
I'll go get him.

105
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,220
Yo, Nick. Dinner.

106
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,650
Oh, shit.

107
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,570
Come on.

108
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,320
Get down.

109
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,130
Dinner.

110
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,300
Can Oleg stay?.

111
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,840
It's already been three times this week.

112
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,050
I'm sure his mom would like to have him home.

113
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:21,640
It's OK. I'm not even hungry.

114
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,310
I'll see you tomorrow. Go Razors.

115
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,480
You, go wash up. Those hands are scary.

116
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,190
Good night, Oleg.

117
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,730
Good night, Mrs Gazelle.

118
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,950
He's not even up there.

119
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:43,120
They turned the basement into a sports complex again.

120
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,080
- How many times am I supposed to tell him?  - What do you want?. They're just boys.

121
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,970
Dad, I won't do it again, I swear.

122
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,840
Don't you expect me to make book on that.

123
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,930
Now, go get your grandfather.

124
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,060
I just washed my hands.

125
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,100
All right.

126
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,440
Hey, Nick.

127
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:20,950
Razors and Blues Friday night. 1 20 yellow, pal.

128
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,070
No way!

129
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,580
It's gonna be a death match between Chester and Erlich!

130
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,330
They're going home in body bags!

131
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,460
Red ice!

132
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,250
Hey, can Oleg come?.

133
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,290
He's never been to one game, and he's...

134
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,960
Not this time. Sal could only score me a pair of tickets.

135
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,710
Maybe next time, though.

136
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,220
Go get your grandfather.

137
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,230
Come on. Get up.

138
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,910
Come on.

139
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,380
(Gunshot)

140
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:11,250
Come on, man. Make it different this time.

141
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,420
(Gunshots)

142
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,840
Get up.

143
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,920
Get up.

144
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,430
I said, get up!

145
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,680
What is this?.

146
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,770
Wolfgang Puck. It's your favourite.

147
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,980
It's thick crust, you damn blyad.

148
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,860
I cut off crust for you. It will be better.

149
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,780
Bring me out a Moskova.

150
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,580
Hey. Hey.

151
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,880
Come here.

152
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,090
Come here.

153
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,890
Come.

154
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,480
Watch this.

155
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,060
John Wayne in The Cowboys.

156
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,940
I don't like cowboys.

157
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,070
Come on.

158
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,190
It's the Duke.

159
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,110
Come, sit.

160
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,750
When I was growing up in Kishinev

161
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:42,960
we had no VHS, no DVD back then.

162
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,840
I remember...

163
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,260
I did a job for this friend of my father.

164
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:53,060
I pick-pocketed a key off this apparatchik.

165
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:59,850
The man gave me as a reward this children's projector.

166
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,980
It came with three films.

167
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:08,240
Speedy Gonzales, Tarzan Of The Apes, John Wayne in The Cowboys.

168
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,830
I watched that thing a thousand times.

169
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,790
Anzor, it's getting cold.

170
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,420
I was nine years old.

171
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,800
I didn't know how long movies were supposed to be.

172
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:34,760
My version of The Cowboys, it was only 1 0 minutes long.

173
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,520
No John Wayne getting shot.

174
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,980
Because it was for kids, they left that part out.

175
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:49,490
I didn't know this...until I arrive in America

176
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,990
and see it on TV for the first time.

177
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:01,210
I hate it. I want my 8mm back.

178
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:03,920
Because on that one, the Duke lives.

179
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,760
Some things were better in the old place.

180
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,720
Not too many. Some things.

181
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,140
Let me show you from the beginning.

182
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,400
No, no, no. Not forward.

183
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,900
This part's better.

184
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,200
Without the Duke?.

185
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,880
Where are you going?.

186
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,000
You don't walk out on the Duke!

187
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,630
Govnyak!

188
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,640
She said he's always distracted and he never finishes his work,

189
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,770
and she wants to get him tested.

190
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:02,440
She wants to get him tested?. Tested for what?.

191
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,900
I think maybe er...attention disorder or something.

192
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,570
I'm not fucking ADD.

193
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,070
Hey! You don't use that word in front of your mother.

194
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:13,110
- What's wrong with ADD?  - The other one, smartass.

195
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,740
He don't use that word, period.

196
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,700
I don't wanna be on medication. You can't make me take it.

197
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:23,870
Don't even worry about it. There's no way in hell anybody's gonna put you on meds, OK?.

198
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,170
Tell that teacher to come to the rink and watch him wax that puck.

199
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,960
- That's perfect concentration every time.  - That's different, Joe.

200
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,090
We're just trying to find out what's going on with you.

201
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,930
She said some great things too.

202
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:39,310
She said that he's very bright, that he's very creative.

203
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:42,890
You left that part out before. I like that part.

204
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,020
I got potential.

205
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,030
You taking a collection down there?.

206
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:27,440
He must eat.

207
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,150
The little prick insults the Duke...

208
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,200
..he don't eat in this house.

209
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,790
You hear me, you little snot face?.

210
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,620
Stay in your room!

211
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,750
Jerk off to your fucking Razors!

212
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:52,130
Faggot!

213
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,960
He's a growing boy.

214
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,310
What did I fucking say, sukka?.

215
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:14,230
He has to eat, Anzor.

216
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,820
Please.

217
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,030
Who puts food on this fucking table?.

218
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,700
Not you, blyad.

219
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,700
I'm the big man of this house.

220
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,830
When I say the little shit don't eat, he don't eat.

221
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,960
Anzor.

222
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,630
John Wayne was a faggot.

223
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,840
So Vicki Gilleto told me she saw you walking hand in hand with Jeannie's daughter.

224
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,970
The fat one?.

225
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,890
Sounded like a gun.

226
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,020
Hey, Nick, throw me some bread.

227
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,570
Oh, shit, get down! Get down!

228
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,070
Are you OK?. You OK?.

229
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,570
Jesus, Joe. What the hell?.

230
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,450
Stay here. Motherfucker.

231
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:05,370
- Motherfucker! I'll kill that fucking piece of shit  - Where are you going?.

232
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,410
You Russian piece of shit!

233
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,370
Fucking cunt.

234
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,830
Shoot my fucking house. I'm gonna fucking kill you.

235
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,210
Dad, wait!

236
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,840
Get back in the house. Get back in the house!

237
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,550
Get back in now! Go!

238
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,700
(Gunshot)

239
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,350
Don't you move.

240
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,560
You piece of shit.

241
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,310
- I'm gonna fucking kill you!  - Nick, get inside.

242
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:31,520
Joe. Joe! What's the matter with you?.

243
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,900
I just called 91 1. Leave it for the cops!

244
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,150
There's a kid in here! Get back in the...

245
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,900
I'm gonna kill you! Open the fucking door!

246
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:41,030
- Oleg's my friend!  - Get inside.

247
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,450
- Open the door.  - Joey, don't be a damn hero!

248
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:46,410
Open up! It's Joey Gazelle from next door! Open up!

249
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,540
Open up.

250
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,830
Get back. You get back.

251
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:55,040
Where is he?. Is he upstairs?.

252
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,540
- His room.  - What?.

253
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,670
- His room  - Get down.

254
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,180
What the fuck?.

255
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,720
Where's the kid?. Huh?.

256
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:19,440
- Where's the kid?  - Fuck him. I'm the one who's shot.

257
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,570
Who is it?. Is he still in the house?.

258
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,400
The little snotfuck ran out back.

259
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,740
Oleg?

260
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,370
Oleg?. What are you trying to say?. Oleg shot you?.

261
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,500
What are you?.

262
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,620
A fucking idiot?.

263
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,750
I didn't do this to myself.

264
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,540
The little prick would've done me too.

265
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,630
Look at him.

266
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,180
(Soundless)

267
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,260
(Gunshot)

268
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,420
(Shot)

269
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,700
Jesus, it's a fucking miracle.

270
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,370
Where'd he get the fucking piece?.

271
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,620
- Fuck should I know?  - What, it wasn't yours?.

272
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,750
No! No way!

273
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,090
I got a.357 in the safe out back.

274
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:24,050
He had some fucking snub-nose thing.

275
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:28,390
Silver. Chrome.

276
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,570
Bullshit! Now you tell me. I'm not playing around.

277
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,450
We saw where you put the gun but he didn't take anything.

278
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,000
- Not with me.  - Well, he went back, Nicky.

279
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,540
I didn't know. I swear I didn't know.

280
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:01,170
Come here. Listen to me. Listen to me.

281
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,380
That piece?. That's not just any hot piece.

282
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,510
- Tommy used it to burn a dirty cop.  - Oh, no. Joe...

283
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:09,550
Yeah. Listen. On top of it, that kid's out there right now.

284
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,600
The cops are on their way. If they find the gun, or they find the kid and he talks, I'm dead.

285
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,730
- Fuck!  - Calm down. Calm down.

286
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:19,600
Calm down. We can get to him.

287
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,730
- You can get to the gun before the cops do.  - Oh, shit.

288
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,860
(Sirens)

289
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,700
Hey.

290
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,750
- Where are you gonna take him?.  - Memorial.

291
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:42,340
Hey, Mila, you should go with him.

292
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,630
I'm gonna look for Oleg. Me and Nicky are gonna go find him, OK?.

293
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:48,260
I'll get Teresa to stay here in case he comes back.

294
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,880
- You should go  - Thanks, Joey.

295
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,680
- Yeah, no problem  - I'm sorry.

296
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,310
We're gonna find him. Don't worry about it.

297
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,460
(Police sirens)

298
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,270
Motherfuck.

299
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,940
(Car doors slam)

300
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:08,070
Come on.

301
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,780
(Door opens)

302
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,450
Police officers. Sir, do you live here?.

303
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,580
No. No, actually I live next door.

304
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,290
I heard gunshots, so I came to see what's going on.

305
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,130
- What did you see?  - Er...

306
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:29,760
I saw Anzor, my neighbour, in the kitchen. He'd been shot.

307
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,720
- See who did it?  - No, he was screaming in Russian.

308
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,560
His wife asked me to stick around for the kid.

309
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,680
- You don't know who shot him?  - No.

310
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,480
I'm gonna need to take a statement outside.

311
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,690
I can't have you messing up the scene.

312
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:44,810
Hey, check it out.

313
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,740
I don't see nothing inside. Maybe all the way back.

314
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,240
Forget it. Leave it for Forensics.

315
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,950
Sir, I need for you to wait outside.

316
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,000
All right. No problem.

317
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:13,220
I'm fucking having a heart attack.

318
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:19,720
- Breath  - I gotta find this kid. I gotta find this kid tonight.

319
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:23,140
Nick, I need to know places. I need to know hideouts.

320
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:26,020
Go to your room and make a list. Nick, make a list!

321
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:28,230
- OK  - I'm not fucking around, Nick.

322
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,490
Joe, just take it easy.

323
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,900
There's no fucking time!

324
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,210
I want you to wait next door.

325
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,330
The second he shows up, call me.

326
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:53,010
I can't have to keep fucking talking to the cops.

327
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:55,760
You understand me?. The fucking gun is on the street.

328
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,300
This whole fucking thing's about to blow up.

329
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:02,020
If Tommy or any ofthose fucking guys find out about it, I'm a dead man.

330
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,140
You gotta fucking help me.

331
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,980
Yeah, if I fucking have to.

332
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,700
Grab your jacket. We're going for a ride.

333
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,130
All right, Nick. I want you to stay in the car, all right?.

334
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,970
Don't get out for anything.

335
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:38,260
If I'm not back in one hour, call your mother. She'll come and get you, OK?.

336
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,280
Excuse me.

337
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:05,330
Who's in the other room?. Is that Yugorsky, gunshot victim?.

338
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:08,710
Teenager. DUl car wreck. I think they just lost a GSW in 3.

339
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:11,090
Lost?

340
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,130
- He's dead?  - Yeah.

341
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,340
No, wait, he took a bullet right here.

342
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:18,380
No, major trauma to chest. He's been in surgery all day.

343
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,350
The guy was a cop.

344
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:24,020
Oh, wait. Yeah, they did bring someone in about 40 minutes ago.

345
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,310
OR number 2. He's gone upstairs already.

346
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,520
That's this way?.

347
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,340
Can I help you, Dr Donaldson?.

348
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,390
Yeah, the cops are waiting outside.

349
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,890
They need to run a match on this bullet asap.

350
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,680
I'll make sure they get it right away.

351
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,330
Excuse me.

352
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,010
You looking for this?. Yugorsky?. GSW shoulder?.

353
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,260
You gotta help me find him, Nick.

354
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:47,060
- What are you gonna do to him?  - I'm not gonna do nothing.

355
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,890
I just need to get my gun back and bring him home.

356
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,100
You sure?.

357
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:55,820
Talk to me, Nick.

358
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:59,570
There's this old abandoned rec centre in the park.

359
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:02,860
Me and Oleg would hang out there sometimes, read comics.

360
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,870
He might be there.

361
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,850
Nice gun.

362
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,740
Detective Rydell, Narcotics.

363
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,700
I already made a statement.

364
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,540
I don't know who the shooter was.

365
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,080
Fucking niggers all look the same.

366
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,710
Yeah. Anzor Yugorsky.

367
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,830
Any relation to lvan Yugorsky?.

368
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,420
My uncle.

369
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:02,010
The Czar of Brighton Beach. I've been to his club a couple of times.

370
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,470
Nice joint.

371
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,590
He even sang a few songs.

372
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,890
He sings like a fucking toad.

373
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:11,770
Well, Sinatra he's not, but he's a man with a serious reputation.

374
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:14,980
- He has a lot of enemies  - Bullshit.

375
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:18,650
I told you it was just some fucking crackhead.

376
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:21,440
Yeah. Well, I spoke to the officers on the scene.

377
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,530
There was no sign of forced entry.

378
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:26,280
But they did find some interesting shit out back.

379
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,660
Six cases of NyQuil, and it ain't even cold season.

380
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:32,120
What do you think a search warrant's gonna turn up?.

381
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,020
- Come on. Where?  - It's this way.

382
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,860
Let's go. Come on.

383
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,450
Come on.

384
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,160
Go, go, go.

385
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,830
This way.

386
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:22,090
Be cool. And let me do all the talking.

387
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,840
I'm gonna get you out of here.

388
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,180
- Help you?   - Yeah.

389
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,640
How much you got?.

390
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,180
Oh, I got a lot.

391
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:38,850
Yes.

392
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:48,200
Oleg, it's Nicky. Are you in there?.

393
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,330
- This the spot?  - Mm.

394
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,000
Hey, where's the stash?.

395
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,130
Last stall, motherfucker.

396
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,930
Find the stash. Find it.

397
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,260
Go on. Find it.

398
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:15,390
Find it!

399
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,610
We're gonna search this entire park. He might still be around.

400
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,750
What the fuck do you think you're doin', white boy?.

401
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:45,340
All right, drop it, or I'll fucking waste the midget. Come on!

402
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:49,170
Go ahead. He's just a tag-along.

403
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,340
Plug 'em, Dell. Fuck it, man! Fuck 'em up.

404
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,900
(Confused shouting)

405
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,100
(Multiple gunshots)

406
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:15,200
All right, stay right by me.

407
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,040
Right here. Against the wall.

408
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,330
Don't you move. Stay right there.

409
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:26,500
I didn't do nothing, Officer. I just came to...

410
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:29,090
Put your fucking head against the fucking stall.

411
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:31,090
Put your fucking head there!

412
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:35,260
Oleg.

413
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,890
I told you to stay outside.

414
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:41,730
- Did you find him?  - Get the fuck outside! Get out of here!

415
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:43,270
I'm talking to you! What did you see?.

416
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:48,650
Find a gun?. You find a silver gun?. Did you find a fucking silver gun?.

417
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,030
I-- l-- I got no gun.

418
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,420
(Snarls)

419
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,580
(Barking)

420
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,420
You wanna study for the GED?. Here.

421
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,220
Look what you done to my fucking ride, bitch.

422
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,020
Jesus, please, baby. Please.

423
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:27,440
I've only been taking one class. One class two hours a week.

424
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,650
I still got time to be pulling tricks.

425
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:32,900
Three Gs I fronted you for these fucking airbags.

426
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,530
And what do I get in return?.

427
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:37,490
- Fucking night school?  - I'll quit!

428
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,120
I'm super proud of you for showing some initiative.

429
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,540
Maybe I'll even come to your graduation.

430
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:46,920
But first you're gonna give me back my fucking property.

431
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,740
(Gun cocks)

432
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:59,510
You learn how to use that watching Sesame Street?.

433
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:03,100
You ain't even holding it right.

434
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,850
What's the matter, kid?. You got the shakes?.

435
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,980
(Clicks)

436
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:13,690
Whoops.

437
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,160
Now I'm gonna put a smile on your face, boy.

438
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,620
Cheek to cheek.

439
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,200
You're gonna be the happiest little brat in school.

440
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,830
Say cheese.

441
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:30,540
Who's laughing now, you fucking grey meat limp-dick motherfucker?.

442
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,880
Mac Daddy!

443
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,840
Who's mackin' now, bitch?.

444
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,970
Pu?eta! (Spits)

445
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,350
You got some cojones, kid.

446
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,300
(Drops pipe)

447
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,220
(Coughs)

448
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,340
(Gasps for breath)

449
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,910
Let me see your fingers, son.

450
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,700
Is this... Hey! Is this your son?.

451
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,250
I'm taking care of him tonight, OK?.

452
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:11,580
Unless you have the number of his doctor and I can get a prescription over the phone,

453
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,420
you'll have to take him to Emergency.

454
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,710
- If you want me to call you a cab...  - I don't need no fucking cab!

455
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,380
I need some spray shit for him!

456
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:22,180
That spray shit is a controlled substance, ma'am, so what can I tell you?.

457
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:27,230
- Keep the change  - I can't... This is stupid. I can't do this.

458
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,520
Listen, why don't we go in the back and talk about it, OK?.

459
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,150
- Look, lady...  - I'll take care of you.

460
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,400
- There's nothing I can do, lady  - There's nothing you can do?.

461
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,860
- Take him to Emergency  - OK.

462
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,240
OK.

463
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,780
Nothing you can fucking do?.

464
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,750
Get what he needs. Now.

465
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,580
- It's Beclovent  - Yeah, I know.

466
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:51,750
Beclovent, bitch!

467
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,000
Come on, let's just go back.

468
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,460
No.

469
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,670
If he turns up, your mom's gonna call.

470
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,540
(Phone rings)

471
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,890
Tee.

472
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:06,680
Sal.

473
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,770
Yeah.

474
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:17,190
- Do girls really get naked in there?  - You'll find out when you're 21.

475
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,780
I've seen Mom naked. It's no big deal.

476
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:23,740
Trust me on this one. It's always a big deal.

477
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,660
Stay here.

478
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,340
# Funky dance music

479
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,450
What?.

480
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,740
It's taken care of.

481
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,870
Oh. It's taken care of. Lucky us.

482
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:12,620
RYDELL: Guys, sit down. Have a seat.

483
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,750
Don't be shy.

484
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:20,210
They make a good Mai Tai for a twat bar, but seriously overpriced.

485
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,920
Two million dollars for a round of drinks.

486
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:25,050
And the pussy ain't even that hot.

487
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:30,220
Jody, I'm doin' business here. Jody! Come on, get the fuck out of here.

488
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,890
Two million dollars.

489
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,810
Suck a dick, you prick bastard. You don't have shit on us.

490
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:36,810
What do you think of this?.

491
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:40,730
Cops never found these at the scene. Just two dead narcs and three dead Jamaicans.

492
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,740
Ballistics is gonna reveal the slugs that killed my partners

493
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,820
didn't come from the Jamaicans.

494
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,990
So there were others involved.

495
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:51,040
As for myself...erm...I was never there.

496
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,000
Well...

497
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,290
dead guys tell no tales.

498
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:58,840
Yeah. Why don't you ask your pal here?.

499
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,590
What the fuck you talkin' about?.

500
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:05,510
You blew my partner Stevie's balls off with a.38 snub nose.

501
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:07,590
A real distinctive piece.

502
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,600
Stainless. Polished up like a spic's hubcap.

503
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,140
Now, let me take a wild guess here.

504
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:17,350
I think you gave him the gun to dump in the river.

505
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:21,860
Now, I'm assuming that he never got around to it, because two hours ago,

506
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,440
his next-door neighbour took a slug in the shoulder.

507
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:27,450
The shooter was the guy's 1 0-year-old stepson.

508
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:29,990
Who was over at Gazelle's house two hours earlier.

509
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:32,330
What the fuck you tryin' to do here?. Huh?.

510
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:33,790
You tryin' to fuckin' play us?.

511
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:36,210
You're wasting your time, and this is bullshit.

512
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,330
Bullshit?. Bullshit, huh?.

513
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:41,290
This punk, Anzor Yugorsky?.

514
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,960
He describes the gun to me in vivid detail.

515
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:47,970
Makes mention it's a snub nose with a serious shine to it.

516
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:52,510
- The fuck is this guy talkin' about?   - He's talkin' about a fuckin' shiny gun.

517
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,430
Big deal. There's a thousand on the street. It ain't the piece.

518
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,310
Oh, yeah?. What were you doing at the hospital when they brought Yugorsky in?. Huh?.

519
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,650
Sniffing around Emergency.

520
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,110
You know what I figure?.

521
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:07,450
I figure you were there to pull a switch on the slug they took out of him.

522
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,570
My wife asked me to go to the hospital.

523
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,950
She was concerned, in a neighbourly way. She wanted me...

524
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:19,210
All right, you know what?. Enough bullshit. I expect to find a bag in this locker at Down Neck Station by midnight

525
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:22,170
If the bag is not there one minute after,

526
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:24,750
I'm taking you all down any fuckin' way I can.

527
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,970
Even if I have to manufacture the case.

528
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:30,840
And you know I will. Cos I got the toughest mob in the world.

529
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:32,970
I'm the law.

530
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,340
(Roar of car engine)

531
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,460
(Screech of tyres)

532
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:52,570
Right, stay put. I'm gonna grab you a burger.

533
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:56,370
- I'm not hungry  - You didn't finish dinner, I'll grab you something.

534
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:58,500
Stay here.

535
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,290
Dad?.

536
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:03,790
Don't go in there. Let's just go home.

537
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,840
It's gonna be all right.

538
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:11,180
No, it's not.

539
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,930
- Hey, Frankie. How you doing?  - Hey. How are ya?.

540
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:18,060
- It's good to see you  - Sit, Joe.

541
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:20,810
- How you doin,' guys?  - Hi, Joey.

542
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:22,810
How you doing?.

543
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:26,360
- You want some coffee, or somethin' to eat?  - Nah, I'm good.

544
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,150
But I got my boy waiting out in the car.

545
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:30,780
- I wanna get him a burger  - Tony, take care of that.

546
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:34,160
Yeah, Tony, get him some fries and a strawberry shake.

547
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,410
Don't scare him. He don't know you're coming.

548
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,830
So, Joe.

549
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:44,880
I got off the phone with lvan about this thing with his nephew.

550
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,500
I told you, it's not the fuckin' piece.

551
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:52,220
Look, everybody knows the nephew is a brain-fried reprobate.

552
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,260
Yeah, whatever. He's a tweaker piece of shit.

553
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:56,640
And he's cooking meth in his backyard.

554
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,680
It's just a matter of time before he blows up the neighbourhood.

555
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:03,270
We know this. But it's a sensitive issue with me, Joe.

556
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:07,190
I'm in bed with Yugorsky on this gasoline deal.

557
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:08,070
Hey.

558
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,360
It's a good deal.

559
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,990
- I don't wanna rock the boat  - Oh, fuck that.

560
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:14,240
Fuck those Russian cunts. Huh?.

561
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:18,700
Pop, it's the fuckin' narc that's got his dick in our ass.

562
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:20,790
Hey.

563
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:23,160
Calm down, Tommy.

564
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:27,290
You see, Joe, the tweaker's got it in his head

565
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:30,510
that maybe you were looking to knock him out of the cooking business

566
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,590
and helped the boy out.

567
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:34,220
Made a piece available to him.

568
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,430
I would never use a kid to do something like that.

569
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,310
Never

570
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:42,430
All right, all right, look

571
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:46,440
I made a personal reassurance to Yugorsky

572
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,770
that I will have my entire crew in the street out looking for that kid.

573
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:53,110
Now, in the interest of professional harmony...

574
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,700
I think we all wanna get our story straight.

575
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,830
You agree, don't you, Joe?.

576
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,790
One hamburger and you're out of my life. That's it.

577
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:08,790
Oleg.

578
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:14,260
Oh shit!

579
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:15,880
Hey, kid.

580
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:19,260
How you doing?. Your old man sent this stuff out for you.

581
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:20,850
Thanks.

582
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:22,970
Ain't it a little late for you to be out?. I have twins your age. They're in bed by now.

583
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:25,060
I have a twins, they shuold be bed by now

584
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,650
What are you, like, nine?

585
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,480
Ten.

586
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,820
And a half.

587
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,320
I gotta go to the bathroom.

588
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,120
Hey, Joey.

589
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,580
Looks like your kid don't listen too well.

590
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:51,880
Must run in the family.

591
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:55,670
Hey, Nicky. Get over here.

592
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,800
Get over here.

593
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,600
What you doing?. I told you to wait in the car.

594
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,310
- I had to go to the bathroom.  - How you doing, Nicky?.

595
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:09,480
Want some Gummy Bears?.

596
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,520
Hey, Nicky.

597
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:13,440
You wouldn't by chance...

598
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,650
know where your friend got that gun?.

599
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,280
Would ya?.

600
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,200
No.

601
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:21,910
I have to go to the bathroom.

602
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:24,040
- OK  - Nick, you go to the bathroom.

603
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:33,290
Have you decided yet?.

604
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:36,170
I have a bus to catch and... Oh, no!

605
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,880
I'll have a cheeseburger and a Coke.

606
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:41,470
I gotta go to the bathroom.

607
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:43,720
Don't worry, we're gonna take care of the cop.

608
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:45,850
- I know  - OK.

609
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:56,400
Where is it?.

610
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,040
Hey, Nick.

611
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,710
- Where the hell are you?.  - Almost done.

612
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,380
Razors with razors.

613
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:21,540
(Toilet flushes)

614
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:26,890
Come on, wash your hands. We gotta get out of here. Come on.

615
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:39,530
Fuck!

616
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,950
Hey, sweetie. How you doing?.

617
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,410
All right, Nick, listen to me.

618
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:50,960
I want you to think about where your friend might be,

619
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,750
because the others are looking for him and if they find him...

620
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:56,130
- They won't find the gun  - What did you say?.

621
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,510
What did you say?.

622
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,140
Don't mess with me. I want you to fuckin' talk to me now.

623
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:09,470
- Promise me you won't hurt him  - I don't have time for this shit.

624
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,350
- Now fuckin' tell me  - Promise.

625
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:14,560
Promise you what?. What?. I promise. I swear to God!

626
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:16,900
I'm not gonna hurt your friend! Come on. Tell me.

627
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,070
Just tell me what you know.

628
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:21,180
(Tyres screech)

629
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:41,090
(Whispers) Come on.

630
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:47,900
(Low moaning)

631
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:49,720
This one here?.

632
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:51,860
(Man coughs)

633
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,060
(Man exhales heavily)

634
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,780
(Toilet flushes)

635
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,730
Where is it?. I thought you said you put it in there.

636
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:35,730
- I did. I put it right...  - Then where is it?.

637
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:39,610
- I thought you said you put it in the tank.  - I put it in here!

638
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:40,900
Oh, shit.

639
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:43,530
Which one did you put it in, Nick?. Huh?.

640
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,650
Which one did you put it in?.

641
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:52,700
Goddamn it, Nicky.

642
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:55,120
Why did you lie to me?. Why did you lie to me?.

643
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,660
I didn't.

644
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,790
- Why did you lie to me?  - I'm not...

645
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,880
- Why did you lie to me?  - I'm not fucking lying! I put it in there!

646
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,840
You just fuckin' killed me, Nick.

647
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,970
You just fuckin' killed me!

648
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,760
I want you to keep an eye open.

649
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:57,850
If you see anybody coming, I want you to cough really loud, all right?.

650
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:06,580
(Voices, Nick coughs)

651
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:12,740
- You're like a broken record  - I'm telling you, you gotta see this thing.

652
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,870
You better not be jerking my chain.

653
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:18,290
- What are you doin' here, kid?  - I was looking for the bathroom.

654
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:21,830
- Even the kid thinks it's a shithole back here  - Shut up, Ralphie.

655
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,250
All right, listen.

656
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:24,790
You go on out through that door,

657
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,880
turn left, go all the way down to the end,

658
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,800
turn left again, and you're there.

659
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,090
You got it?.

660
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,350
- Come on  - Er...which door?

661
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,640
Come here, kid. Come here.

662
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:45,320
Hey, Yolanda. Wait up!

663
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:50,280
- Where you going with my cheesecake?  - It's for paying customers. Not you.

664
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:00,750
I've got your number, fucker.

665
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:13,890
Forget it. I ain't dragging your butt across no state lines.

666
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:16,740
(Sighs)

667
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:19,850
Look, baba, why don't you just go home?.

668
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:22,890
I bet you things are not as bad as you think they are.

669
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,610
(Sighs) Come on, baba.

670
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,380
(Police siren)

671
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,330
Oh, mother...

672
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:39,950
Hands where we can see 'em!

673
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,660
Over here.

674
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:43,790
Run! Run, little man! Run!

675
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:50,300
Hey.

676
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:54,260
Get off! Get off!

677
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:15,660
(Rap playing on stereo)

678
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,330
Do you know these guys?.

679
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:26,260
(Cellphone rings)

680
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:29,880
- Yeah  - Babe?.

681
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:33,800
- Where the hell are you?  - I'm takin' care ofthings.

682
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,840
Forget about it - they picked up Oleg at a bus station with a hooker.

683
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:40,180
Who picked him up?.

684
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,140
- The cops?  - Yeah.

685
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:44,520
Jesus Christ, this is fuckin' bullshit.

686
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,100
- Hey  - Fuck!

687
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:48,020
Hey! You got Nicky with you?.

688
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,440
Yeah, he's right here.

689
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,980
Then stop using your mouth around him!

690
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:54,530
And bring my son home! Now!

691
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:58,160
Yeah. That's what I'm doing. I'm bringing him home right now.

692
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:59,940
(Tyres screech)

693
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:03,140
(Drink fizzes)

694
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:10,380
Ah. Do you mind?.

695
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,500
I'm feeling kind of parched.

696
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:16,760
Big game Friday night.

697
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,550
I bet you're excited about that, huh?.

698
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,100
It's gonna be red ice, and plenty of blue shirt body bags.

699
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:24,220
Am I right?.

700
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:29,190
Look... I could help you, kid.

701
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:31,020
You and your mom, if need be.

702
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:33,610
Now I could get that prick out of your life.

703
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,570
Lock him up. I could do that, I'm a cop.

704
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:41,320
All you have to do is tell me where you found the gun.

705
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:43,450
And where you stashed it.

706
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:46,290
That's it.

707
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:48,410
What do you say?.

708
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,540
You'll let me help you.

709
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,340
Get out of here, Mila.

710
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:59,090
You know?. Go to a shelter.

711
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:01,220
I can get you an address.

712
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,640
You don't understand.

713
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:08,310
I belong to him.

714
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:11,190
No. No.

715
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:13,310
No, no, I don't understand.

716
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:19,990
I was prostitute in Moscow.

717
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:29,330
Yugorsky Escort Service offered tobring girls over with promise of big bucks.

718
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:34,750
We would owe 50 thousand dollars. You know, pay back through work.

719
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,720
I take offer.

720
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,840
Not tell them I'm pregnant.

721
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:45,470
When they find out

722
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:49,480
they insist I have an abortion.

723
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,600
I tell them no.

724
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:57,070
They send Anzor to kill me.

725
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:01,240
Anzor's not a killer.

726
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:06,120
He's not a hard man like big Yugorsky.

727
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:11,370
He thinks...

728
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,960
he thinks he's John Wayne.

729
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:20,470
Wants to do right thing.

730
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:26,800
He goes against his uncle, and tells big man Yugorsky he will pay off my debt.

731
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:31,310
His uncle refuses

732
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:34,270
and tells him

733
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:36,400
he will send others to kill me.

734
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,440
Set example.

735
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,360
So Anzor make me wife.

736
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:47,410
Big man Yugorsky can't kill his nephew's wife.

737
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:56,710
But he tells Anzor to leave Little Odessa.

738
00:54:56,790 --> 00:55:00,880
He's no longer working for Yugorsky family.

739
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,140
I'm gonna get you the name of a shelter.

740
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:11,300
(Car approaching, tyres screech)

741
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:19,380
(Tyres screech)

742
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:22,150
You OK?.

743
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:26,820
This ain't right, Joe. He don't need to be put through this.

744
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:29,990
Hey, Nick, I'm proud of you. You done good, all right?.

745
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:41,250
I'm gonna head up to Community Hills.

746
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:45,760
Cops don't got the gun yet but I may have a line on it so I'm gonna go over there.

747
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,140
I'm scared, Joe.

748
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:51,510
I am pissed at you, and I am scared!

749
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,640
Equal measures.

750
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:01,690
Be careful.

751
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,290
- Hey  - Hey.

752
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:16,330
Just got word. The cops picked up the kid.

753
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:19,960
- Anything you still wanna tell us?  - Tell you what?. There's nothing to tell.

754
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,420
- Where you headed, Joe?  - Erm....

755
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:26,590
I was supposed to head to the store and pick up some milk and eggs.

756
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:29,180
In all the excitement I forgot to do it, so...

757
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:31,600
Hm.

758
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,560
Yugorsky's gonna call us when he talks to the kid.

759
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:38,060
Don't go too far.

760
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,520
- Later, Joe  - Yeah, see ya.

761
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:46,990
Hey, Tee. Looking fucking good.

762
00:56:54,990 --> 00:56:58,500
He keeps giving me this bullshit story about finding the gun

763
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:00,960
in some abandoned locker in school.

764
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,590
What do you want me to do?.

765
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:05,510
The little fucker shot me. He ain't gonna spill dick to me.

766
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:08,680
You know, I don't think I'm being clear enough here.

767
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,800
You know what I mean?.

768
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:13,970
Let me be crystal clear.

769
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:19,770
You get the boy to give up Gazelle or I'm closing shop on your tweaker ass

770
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:22,020
and I'm taking you down fucking hard.

771
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:23,770
Understand me?.

772
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:25,900
(Door opens)

773
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:31,860
Hey, cowboy.

774
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,780
Wanna go get some ice cream?.

775
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:38,100
# Rap

776
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:40,220
(Car approaching)

777
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:58,350
Get the fuck away from my car.

778
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:01,700
(Angry shouting)

779
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:06,020
(Baby crying)

780
00:58:06,110 --> 00:58:08,690
- Hey. Hey, I'm looking for Manny Perez  - He's not here.

781
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:12,240
No! Oh, my God! I've never seen him.

782
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,620
- Manny?. Where the fuck is he?  - He's not here!

783
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:17,450
- Where is he?. Where is he?  - He's not here!

784
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:19,000
Better not fuckin' lie to me!

785
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,040
- Argh!  - Where the fuck is he?.

786
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:22,830
- Where is he?  - OK, OK!

787
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,880
- Where is he?  - He play cards at Armando's.

788
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,040
- Armando's?  - Uh-huh.

789
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:27,880
He's at Armando's. Yeah.

790
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,760
Get the hell out of the way! Just stay right there.

791
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:33,820
(Woman speaks rapidly in Spanish)

792
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:35,850
What's your name?.

793
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:37,470
What's your name?.

794
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,600
- Conchita  - Conchita.

795
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,850
Now you listen to me, Conchita. You listen to me real good.

796
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:44,480
- I don't wanna hurt Manny  - OK.

797
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:47,520
I don't wanna hurt him, but he has something that belongs to me.

798
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:50,110
- A gun. Do you know anything about a gun?  - No, no.

799
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:52,740
It's block 5, number 602. That's where he is.

800
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,240
OK. Now listen to me.

801
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:58,030
We are now on what we call the honour system.You comprende?.

802
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,580
- You understand?  - Si, se?or.

803
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:01,370
OK. You don't call Manny.

804
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:02,960
You don't tell Manny I'm coming.

805
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,330
You don't warn him for anything, cos if you do, I'm gonna come back here!

806
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,760
I can be an asshole.

807
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:22,060
You made your point.

808
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,350
You showed some balls.

809
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:31,990
I like that.

810
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,280
But now it's time to be smart.

811
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:40,450
You tell me...what I want to know.

812
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:43,870
And I'm gonna reward you.

813
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,130
Razors season tickets.

814
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,050
- I'm sorry  - It's OK.

815
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:56,760
I told you, we're cool.

816
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:59,350
- Just tell me  - I'm sorry I missed.

817
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:03,890
You little shit.

818
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:08,860
Tell me where the fucking gun is.

819
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:12,190
You tell me or I will fucking kill you!

820
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:19,910
Oleg!

821
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:28,460
Oleg!

822
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:33,250
Oleg!

823
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:40,600
Where are you, you little shit?.

824
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,190
Oleg!

825
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:50,230
I'll find you!

826
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:58,950
I'm gonna kill you!

827
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,370
You're only making it worse on yourself!

828
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:04,620
You hear me?.

829
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:15,760
Edele, I think we've picked up a stray.

830
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,880
Indeed.

831
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:21,140
Well, hello there.

832
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:23,260
- Hi  - And who mightyou be?.

833
01:01:25,770 --> 01:01:29,560
- I think we should get another ice cream cone  - I think you're right, papa bear.

834
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:43,530
Hey. Hey.

835
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:45,240
- You Manny?  - Manny, no.

836
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:47,080
He's upstairs. What you want with him?.

837
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,660
Business.

838
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:51,040
If he owes you any money, forget about it.

839
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:53,080
Ha! I just cleaned the cabron out.

840
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:55,220
(Knock on door)

841
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:57,130
Yeah?. Who is it?.

842
01:01:57,220 --> 01:02:00,300
(Low conversation in Spanish)

843
01:02:05,310 --> 01:02:06,970
Heads down on the fucking table!

844
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:10,730
Heads down and hands behind your head! You move and I will fuck you up!

845
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:12,900
I will fuck you up! Don't you move!

846
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:15,520
Don't you fucking move! Get the fuck down!

847
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:18,280
Which one of you is fucking Manny?. Who's Manny?.

848
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:20,400
Manny's not here.

849
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:23,870
- Motherfucking pendejo!  - Are you Manny?.

850
01:02:23,950 --> 01:02:27,370
You know what the fuck I want! You called me pendejo, you fuck!

851
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:30,120
I want my fucking gun! I want my fucking snub nose

852
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,250
that you lifted from the fucking Arlington.

853
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:34,920
Now, where the fuck is it?. Where the fuck is it?.

854
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:39,300
Argh!

855
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:41,670
Fuck you! Where the fuck is my gun?.

856
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:43,820
(Laughter)

857
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:49,140
Your tool left a while ago.

858
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:58,660
# Rap

859
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:00,700
#Rap

860
01:03:01,690 --> 01:03:04,560
Fuck! Fuck!

861
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:06,320
Motherfucker!

862
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:08,370
(Screams)

863
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:11,490
- Look at that  - That's a good smile.

864
01:03:11,570 --> 01:03:14,160
- Look at those braces  - There's a little dimple there.

865
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,290
Yeah.

866
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:20,500
Yeah, that's super cute.

867
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:23,380
Isn't this cool, huh?. Yeah, come on. Look back in the camera.

868
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:26,210
Try it again. Now you push that. Look in there.

869
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:28,420
Oh, my gosh, yeah! You can see, right?.

870
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:32,640
- It's very smart  - Hey, Eric. You wanna hug your sister?.

871
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:35,260
- Yeah. Come on, please  - Just a little bit.

872
01:03:35,350 --> 01:03:37,970
- Get a little closer  - Come on. You guys love each other.

873
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:39,810
- Get a little closer  - You need a hug.

874
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:41,350
- A little closer  - Come on.

875
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,730
Extend the arm.

876
01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:46,440
Come on. Come on, Eric.

877
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:50,190
You can do it a little better than that. I mean, that's your sister, right?.

878
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:53,410
- Very good  - You love your sister, don't you?.

879
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:57,030
What about you, Oleg?. You wanna be in the film as well, don't you?.

880
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:59,500
My stomach hurts. Can I go to the bathroom?.

881
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:01,620
Sure.

882
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:05,500
- I'll just hold onto this  - Mm-hm.

883
01:04:05,590 --> 01:04:06,920
Go outside.

884
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,050
You take a right and then a left.

885
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,510
- Hurry up, though. You're missing out  - Mm.

886
01:04:15,010 --> 01:04:17,890
- Who wants to play dress up?  - Oh, good, dress up!

887
01:04:17,970 --> 01:04:20,310
We have...the Burning Falcon.

888
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:21,730
And the Volt.

889
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:37,220
There you are. I thought you needed to go to the bathroom.

890
01:05:39,390 --> 01:05:41,680
I couldn't find it.

891
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,390
Silly boy.

892
01:05:43,470 --> 01:05:44,890
I told you to take a right.

893
01:05:45,810 --> 01:05:48,150
Then a left.

894
01:05:50,190 --> 01:05:52,940
Come. I'll show you.

895
01:05:58,570 --> 01:06:01,450
Don't forget to wash your hands when you're done.

896
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,760
(Rings)

897
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,430
Joe?.

898
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:21,890
- Mrs Gazelle?  - Who is this?.

899
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:23,680
- Is this...?  - Oleg.

900
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,520
I'm sorry about taking the gun.

901
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:29,150
- Oleg, where are you?  - I think I'm in trouble.

902
01:06:29,230 --> 01:06:31,860
Sweetheart, I know what happened, OK?.

903
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:35,690
I need you to be straight up with me. Are the police listening in on this call?.

904
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:37,200
No. I'm not with the police.

905
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:39,610
I'm at Dez and Edele's apartment.

906
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:42,490
- There's two other kids here  - What?.

907
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:44,950
- I thi...I think they're gonna hurt us  - What?.

908
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,330
Oh, Jesus.

909
01:06:46,410 --> 01:06:48,580
Come on, come on. Is this some kind of a joke?.

910
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:51,670
Oleg, you have caused enough trouble today.

911
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:53,290
- Where are you?  - I don't know.

912
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:54,750
I was in the back of a van.

913
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:57,840
They brought us here. This room with all these toys.

914
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,340
They're making a video.

915
01:06:59,430 --> 01:07:03,600
OK. OK, Oleg. I need you to look around for an address for me, OK?.

916
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:06,180
Um... is there any mail laying around?.

917
01:07:06,270 --> 01:07:08,980
I'm in the bathroom. She's gonna come back any minute.

918
01:07:09,060 --> 01:07:10,440
Bathroom, Jesus.

919
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,980
I don't know. I don't know.

920
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:14,400
I don't know, um...

921
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:17,780
Er... I don't know. Just... just call 91 1.

922
01:07:19,490 --> 01:07:22,570
No. I don't want to go back to the police.

923
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:24,080
Why?.

924
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,910
They want me to say I got the gun from Mr Gazelle.

925
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
(Knocking)

926
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:35,170
- Do you need some help in there?  - I'm OK.

927
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:37,800
It's my stomach. I'm almost done.

928
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:40,300
Oh, you poor thing.

929
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:43,510
Well, I'm right outside.

930
01:07:43,590 --> 01:07:45,260
- Oleg?  - I'm still here.

931
01:07:45,350 --> 01:07:47,390
OK.

932
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:49,980
OK. So look in the medicine cabinet.

933
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:52,850
Do you see any...any bottles?.

934
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:56,440
Prescription bottles usually have the address on the front label.

935
01:07:58,690 --> 01:07:59,860
Do you see anything?.

936
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:01,860
Just... Is there anything in there?.

937
01:08:05,030 --> 01:08:07,080
Oleg! What's happening?.

938
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:13,620
Oleg?. It's Dez. You wanna open up, please?.

939
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:16,090
Oleg?.

940
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:22,380
OK. Oleg?.

941
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:24,220
Come on.

942
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,220
- Oleg! Oleg!  - Oleg?.

943
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:27,430
What's going on?.

944
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:28,850
Oleg?

945
01:08:28,930 --> 01:08:32,100
- Just open the door!  - Mrs Gazelle, I got a bottle.

946
01:08:32,190 --> 01:08:33,520
So now read me the address.

947
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,940
- 1 456, Owens Park Lane, Hoboken  - Oleg, open the door!

948
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:38,980
Oleg!

949
01:08:39,070 --> 01:08:40,650
Let's go! Open the door!

950
01:08:41,570 --> 01:08:42,280
Oleg?.

951
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:43,450
Come on!

952
01:08:43,530 --> 01:08:45,530
Oleg!

953
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,640
(Door bursts open)

954
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:51,250
Wake up. Wake up!

955
01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:54,620
- We've gotta go get Oleg. Put your coat on  - I thought he was in jail.

956
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:01,550
Hey, Holmes.

957
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:05,300
- I got a busted headlight  - Hey, Lester, my man!

958
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:07,850
Ouch. Who got over on you, bro?.

959
01:09:07,930 --> 01:09:12,770
Some puta whose forwarding address is gonna be in ten different zip codes.

960
01:09:12,850 --> 01:09:14,770
All of them, dumpsters.

961
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,640
(Both laugh)

962
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:20,400
I got you covered by tomorrow night.

963
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:23,400
Hey, check this out.

964
01:09:24,570 --> 01:09:27,870
Is that sweet or what?. Hey! A royal flush put her in my pocket.

965
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:31,410
- Three hundred cold puts her in mine  - No, man. She's a beauty.

966
01:09:31,490 --> 01:09:33,540
Think I'm gonna hold on to her.

967
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:36,750
Five hundred.

968
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:41,170
Al won't miss them. Not until Cinco de Mayo.

969
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:55,850
Oh, Joe! Shit!

970
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:01,520
I'm under a lot of stress tonight, so whatever I say don't count.

971
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:06,860
Do I still have to go to school tomorrow?.

972
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:08,990
I don't know. We'll see.

973
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:28,050
- Remember me?  - Who the fuck are you?.

974
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:31,300
You got something that belongs to me. Snub nose.38.

975
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:33,930
You scored it off of Manny in a card game. I need it back.

976
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:39,600
JOEY: Fuck!

977
01:10:39,690 --> 01:10:41,940
I want my fucking gun!

978
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:44,070
Who the fuck are you, huh?.

979
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:46,940
JOEY: Don't be fucking stupid!

980
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:49,070
Fuck!

981
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:52,490
(Curses in Spanish)

982
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:12,970
You fuck! You fuck! Where's my fucking gun?.

983
01:11:13,050 --> 01:11:15,060
Help me! I'm burning!

984
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:17,640
Where's my gun?. You gonna tell me where my gun is now?.

985
01:11:17,730 --> 01:11:21,980
If you don't tell me where I can find it you'll have third-degree burns. Know what that means?.

986
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:24,980
No cock, asshole! You'll have a fucking melted dick!

987
01:11:25,070 --> 01:11:26,860
- I sold it to a pimp. Lester!  - A pimp?.

988
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:28,990
Shit! What you waiting on for?.

989
01:11:29,070 --> 01:11:31,030
Where can I find him?.  Where can I find him?.

990
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:35,370
- I need to fucking know now!  - He booked a cab! Union Fleet. Ask them!

991
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:45,500
Stay here. Do not move.

992
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:59,060
I'm not touching it. Get away from me. Fuck you!

993
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:01,440
DEZ: Ow, you little shit! Just bit me!

994
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,960
(Doorbell)

995
01:12:10,610 --> 01:12:13,490
- Who the hell is that?  - I'll go see. Throw me my robe.

996
01:12:13,570 --> 01:12:15,030
Take the kids into the bedroom.

997
01:12:36,350 --> 01:12:38,390
- May I help you?  - I'm looking for Oleg.

998
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:41,770
- Oleg. You must have the wrong address  - No. He's a ten-year-old boy.

999
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:44,100
He's pale. He never smiles.

1000
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:47,230
He's my neighbour's kid. He called me from this apartment.

1001
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:49,570
Owens Park Lane, apartment 303.

1002
01:12:49,650 --> 01:12:51,940
Well, he must have given you the wrong address.

1003
01:12:52,030 --> 01:12:54,240
Or maybe you heard wrong. There's no Oleg.

1004
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:56,740
He said that he was being held against his will.

1005
01:12:56,820 --> 01:13:00,700
That's ridiculous. There's only my husband and my two children inside.

1006
01:13:00,790 --> 01:13:03,290
- No-one else. And it's late  - Well...

1007
01:13:03,370 --> 01:13:06,080
I would like to take a look inside to satisfy my curiosity.

1008
01:13:06,170 --> 01:13:08,630
This is absurd. Are you suggesting I kidnapped Oleg?.

1009
01:13:08,710 --> 01:13:13,340
You know what?. I'm gonna call the police. I'm gonna stand here waiting for them to arrive.

1010
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:15,680
When all's you gotta do is just let me in.

1011
01:13:17,930 --> 01:13:19,310
If you must.

1012
01:13:35,490 --> 01:13:37,530
- Do you mind?  - Go right ahead.

1013
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:43,290
The children's room is on the right.

1014
01:13:43,370 --> 01:13:45,210
They are asleep.

1015
01:13:45,290 --> 01:13:47,330
Please go right in.

1016
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:51,920
(Exhales heavily)

1017
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:01,060
- Hello  - Don't ask, it's too ridiculous.

1018
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:03,180
Sorry, I'm really embarrassed.

1019
01:14:04,430 --> 01:14:07,600
Excuse me, but I seriously doubt he's hiding in there.

1020
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,960
(Dez mouths)

1021
01:14:21,410 --> 01:14:23,450
- What's through here?  - Playroom.

1022
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:28,710
Whoa.

1023
01:14:28,790 --> 01:14:30,920
Wow.

1024
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,210
You guys got your own little Disneyland in here.

1025
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:37,680
Well, it's all about the children. And as you can see, there's no Oleg.

1026
01:14:48,940 --> 01:14:50,940
I really hope that you find him.

1027
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:53,230
You hear too many stories these days.

1028
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:57,900
- God only knows if it were our children. - If it were your children...photographs.

1029
01:14:57,990 --> 01:15:00,030
- Excuse me!  - Photographs.

1030
01:15:01,410 --> 01:15:03,450
No photographs.

1031
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:07,120
If they were your children, you would have...

1032
01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:10,040
at least one photograph somewhere in this apartment.

1033
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:13,710
This is ridiculous! We only moved into this place. Everything's in storage.

1034
01:15:13,790 --> 01:15:17,300
Now I really must ask you to leave! I insist!

1035
01:15:18,510 --> 01:15:20,550
Oleg?

1036
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,320
(Dez and Edele whispering)

1037
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:38,490
Oh, man. This is too much.

1038
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:41,160
It's too much.

1039
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:43,870
- It's like some kind of a lure  - You're making a mistake.

1040
01:15:43,950 --> 01:15:45,370
Tell her to leave, Dez.

1041
01:15:45,450 --> 01:15:48,580
Ma'am, if you don't leave right now, I'm calling the police.

1042
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:52,540
Call them. Call them. And mention you've got two abducted children in the next room.

1043
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:56,420
Two children who don't appear in any photographs in this house.

1044
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,970
- Where is Oleg?  - How dare you suggest that we...

1045
01:15:59,050 --> 01:16:00,550
Oh...

1046
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:02,680
Where's the boy?.

1047
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:05,760
Where is he?.

1048
01:16:19,530 --> 01:16:22,360
Oh, my God. Oh...

1049
01:16:22,450 --> 01:16:24,490
You better pray he's not dead.

1050
01:16:31,410 --> 01:16:33,460
Back off, you sick fuck!

1051
01:16:35,790 --> 01:16:37,840
Jesus. Oh, God, help me.

1052
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:40,760
Come on, come on, come on.

1053
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:48,510
I said back the fuck up!

1054
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:51,520
You sick, twisted, motherfucking cunt!

1055
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:53,230
Oh...

1056
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:57,520
Oh, wake up.

1057
01:16:57,610 --> 01:17:00,280
That's right. That's right. Breathe. You're gonna be OK.

1058
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:03,070
You can breathe, Oleg. I'm right here.

1059
01:17:03,150 --> 01:17:04,990
I'm right here, just breathe.

1060
01:17:05,070 --> 01:17:07,120
That's right.

1061
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:18,790
Back off!

1062
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:21,210
I said back off!

1063
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:23,340
I will blow you away!

1064
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:28,510
OK. Can you get up?.

1065
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:33,680
OK. Go to the bedroom. Get the two kids. Bring them downstairs. Nicky's there.

1066
01:17:33,770 --> 01:17:36,810
All right?. Wait with him. OK?. Move over.

1067
01:17:40,610 --> 01:17:42,650
Get out of his way.

1068
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:49,990
I've got a safe in the bedroom. There's 100,000 cash in there, and diamonds.

1069
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:52,620
All you gotta do is take the boy and walk away.

1070
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:55,760
(Exhales)

1071
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:08,430
Oh, my God. Oh...

1072
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:11,470
Oh, God.

1073
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:14,430
Oh...

1074
01:18:15,980 --> 01:18:18,020
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1075
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,570
Oh, my God.

1076
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:25,110
Oh, you sick fucks.

1077
01:18:25,190 --> 01:18:26,780
You're right. We're sick.

1078
01:18:26,860 --> 01:18:29,780
We are. We're sick. This is really great. This is gonna help us.

1079
01:18:29,870 --> 01:18:31,700
- Give me your phone.  - Please, yeah.

1080
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:33,330
- What are you doing?  - She wants...

1081
01:18:33,410 --> 01:18:34,790
Who are you calling?.

1082
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,040
(Ringing tone)

1083
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:43,050
911. What is the nature ofyour emergency?.

1084
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:47,260
I just heard shooting across the hall. 1456, Owens Park Lane.

1085
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:49,430
What is your name, ma'am?.

1086
01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:52,260
You're not serious.

1087
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:58,000
(Thudding)

1088
01:18:59,190 --> 01:19:01,020
OK.

1089
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:07,400
(Police siren)

1090
01:19:11,490 --> 01:19:16,120
Hey. Hey, listen, one of your cabs just picked up my brother at Al's Automotive.

1091
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:17,790
Yeah, well, listen to me.

1092
01:19:17,870 --> 01:19:20,960
I was supposed to pick him up, but there's been a family emergency.

1093
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:25,460
So, what I need you to do is I need you to find out where the cab dropped him off at.

1094
01:19:25,550 --> 01:19:29,220
Yeah, call me back. My phone number's 555-7556.

1095
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:33,560
(Cellphone rings)

1096
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:35,720
Hello?. Yeah.

1097
01:19:36,890 --> 01:19:39,440
Hey, wait, wait, wait. Hey, calm down.

1098
01:19:52,870 --> 01:19:55,450
- What happened to your face?  - It's nothing.

1099
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:57,200
- I need to talk to you, Joe  - Later.

1100
01:19:57,290 --> 01:19:58,450
No, now!

1101
01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:01,040
Why couldn't you have just taken the kid and left?.

1102
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,210
Why couldn't you have taken the kid and left?.

1103
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:06,840
I have never seen evil before tonight, Joe.

1104
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:09,090
Real fucking evil.

1105
01:20:09,170 --> 01:20:10,630
OK?.

1106
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:14,720
And I know that's not what I see when I look in your eyes.

1107
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,470
Thanks a lot, Tee.

1108
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:21,230
- I'm trying to make a point here.  - I know what point you're trying to make!

1109
01:20:21,310 --> 01:20:24,440
I did not marry an evil man, OK?.

1110
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:26,650
I did not marry an evil man.

1111
01:20:26,730 --> 01:20:29,900
Shady, sleazy, mixed up with the wrong kind of people.

1112
01:20:29,990 --> 01:20:32,030
But definitely not evil.

1113
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,070
I know what you're trying to say, Tee.

1114
01:20:36,030 --> 01:20:37,160
Do you?.

1115
01:20:38,620 --> 01:20:43,000
I hope so. I have turned my back on a lot of things since we've been married.

1116
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:45,670
My eyes are wide open on this one.

1117
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:51,520
(Blows)

1118
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:57,100
Nicky, go home with your mom.

1119
01:20:57,180 --> 01:20:59,220
Oleg, let's go take a ride.

1120
01:21:12,990 --> 01:21:15,530
What kind of music you listen to?.

1121
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:17,120
Huh?.

1122
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,910
You listen to that techno shit?.

1123
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:23,120
You listen to rap music?. You like rap music?.

1124
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:25,460
They don't have what I listen to on the radio.

1125
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:26,920
Yeah, what's that?.

1126
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,630
Kvasha. It's my mother's tape from Russia.

1127
01:21:30,710 --> 01:21:32,470
What the fuck?.

1128
01:21:32,550 --> 01:21:33,720
Kvasha?.

1129
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:38,510
You're American, not Russian. Why listen to that shit?.

1130
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:43,940
My mother said I started in her belly in Russia, so I'm Russian.

1131
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:47,770
You're not a Russian, you're an American, cos you were born in the USA.

1132
01:21:47,860 --> 01:21:49,520
You're an American. An American.

1133
01:21:49,610 --> 01:21:51,280
Say, "I'm an American." You say it.

1134
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:54,360
Say, "I'm an American." Say, "I'm an American."

1135
01:21:54,450 --> 01:21:56,070
- I'm an American  - American.

1136
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:59,330
You were born in the fucking USA. That makes you an American.

1137
01:22:00,330 --> 01:22:02,290
Listen to this.

1138
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:04,160
# SOUTHSlDE JOHNNY:\nI Don't Want To Go Home

1139
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:07,250
He'll warm up the back seat for you when you're ready to get laid.

1140
01:22:07,330 --> 01:22:09,380
You mark my words.

1141
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:11,960
# Oh, I know that it's getting late...

1142
01:22:12,710 --> 01:22:14,050
Fucking Kvasha.

1143
01:22:14,130 --> 01:22:17,890
Christ! You put me through the ringer tonight. You know that, don't you?.

1144
01:22:17,970 --> 01:22:20,140
# I'm in no hurry, baby, time can wait...

1145
01:22:20,220 --> 01:22:22,060
- Hm?  - I won't say nothing.

1146
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:23,720
Yeah, what'd you say to the cops?.

1147
01:22:23,810 --> 01:22:28,060
- What'd you say to the cops?  - I got the gun from Stevie Monroe's locker.

1148
01:22:28,150 --> 01:22:30,060
He doesn't go there no more.

1149
01:22:30,150 --> 01:22:31,770
Nicky told me to say that.

1150
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:33,610
Nicky told you to say that?.

1151
01:22:33,690 --> 01:22:35,110
Smart kid.

1152
01:22:35,190 --> 01:22:37,820
He's my best friend. We're gonna play for the Razors.

1153
01:22:37,910 --> 01:22:39,820
Yeah?

1154
01:22:39,910 --> 01:22:40,910
Hello?

1155
01:22:40,990 --> 01:22:42,990
Yeah, that was me.

1156
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:44,870
The Royal Towers?. How long ago?.

1157
01:22:45,710 --> 01:22:47,040
All right, thanks.

1158
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:50,380
Hold on. We're gonna go reclaim some stolen property.

1159
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:52,480
(Engine growls)

1160
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,160
(Rap music in background)

1161
01:23:13,110 --> 01:23:16,440
Don't worry about it. We're just gonna sit tight for a while.

1162
01:23:17,530 --> 01:23:18,820
You know...

1163
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:23,780
I used to know this kid.

1164
01:23:25,910 --> 01:23:28,500
His old man was a real fucking piece of shit.

1165
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:33,750
Always drunk.

1166
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:36,880
Always smacking him and his mom around.

1167
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:45,100
This kid, he takes his licks... and waits this old fucking prick out.

1168
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:49,890
On the morning of his 1 4th birthday,

1169
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:53,980
he walks into his old man's room with a baseball bat.

1170
01:23:57,530 --> 01:24:00,450
Then he Mark McGwire's the fucking living shit out of him.

1171
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:08,790
After that, the old man, he can't even hold a spoon without shaking.

1172
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:14,290
He don't remember things too good either.

1173
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:16,420
He's neutralised.

1174
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:21,470
Which is a good thing.

1175
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:25,220
Four more years max.

1176
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:28,810
Maybe three if you get some size early on. You just gotta hang in there.

1177
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:33,860
It's more money.

1178
01:24:33,940 --> 01:24:35,770
It's lonely at the top.

1179
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:38,440
Running these corporations...

1180
01:24:39,110 --> 01:24:41,950
Get your hands off Lester's property. That's my property.

1181
01:24:42,030 --> 01:24:44,240
I'm sorry.

1182
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:46,660
You stay right there. Don't you move.

1183
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:49,950
Stay just like that.

1184
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:51,790
What the fuck?.

1185
01:24:55,250 --> 01:24:57,460
Jesus Christ, not now.

1186
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:01,970
Let's get in the cab.

1187
01:25:04,010 --> 01:25:06,720
- I can hide it for you  - No, give it to me!

1188
01:25:07,510 --> 01:25:10,100
They're gonna think you got the.38 and frisk you.

1189
01:25:11,350 --> 01:25:14,060
Come on. Give me the fucking gun.

1190
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:27,120
Yo, Joe. What you got there?.

1191
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:35,000
He's a Christmas elf. I found him hitching a ride on Broad Street.

1192
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:36,920
(Chuckles)

1193
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:39,090
Joey's a funny fucking guy, huh?.

1194
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:41,380
Let me take a guess, Joey.

1195
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:43,630
You were just about to call us.

1196
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:47,050
That's pretty good. You must have telepathy.

1197
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:48,760
I must.

1198
01:25:48,850 --> 01:25:50,640
Give me your piece.

1199
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:53,480
Think I'm fucking around?.

1200
01:25:56,060 --> 01:25:57,610
How about that, huh?.

1201
01:25:57,690 --> 01:25:59,400
Cocked and ready to go.

1202
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:01,650
What are you, fucking nervous, tough guy?.

1203
01:26:04,490 --> 01:26:06,530
You're gonna follow us, Joey.

1204
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:09,700
The kid'll ride with us.

1205
01:26:26,970 --> 01:26:28,470
Stay the fuck in the car.

1206
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:37,280
(Cellphone rings)

1207
01:26:37,350 --> 01:26:40,520
Yeah?. Nah, nah, I'm with him right now.

1208
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:44,280
Are you 1 00 per cent?.

1209
01:26:46,110 --> 01:26:48,160
You're a fucking idiot.

1210
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:53,450
Nah, don't worry about it. I'm gonna take care of this motherfucker now.

1211
01:27:00,710 --> 01:27:02,300
Come on, what the fuck?.

1212
01:27:02,380 --> 01:27:04,010
You're gonna fucking whack me?.

1213
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:08,720
Come on, man! I told you. You got any doubts, I'll tell you.

1214
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:12,100
Shut your mouth.  Shut your fucking mouth...now.

1215
01:27:13,390 --> 01:27:14,930
You see, my old man.

1216
01:27:16,060 --> 01:27:18,140
He says to me, "Nobody...

1217
01:27:19,230 --> 01:27:20,810
knows nobody."

1218
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:23,610
Would you fucking put that piece of shit away?.

1219
01:27:23,690 --> 01:27:26,860
- I fucking told you on my fucking family's...  - Fucking family?.

1220
01:27:26,940 --> 01:27:29,410
When I leave here, I'm gonna fuck Teresa in the ass.

1221
01:27:29,490 --> 01:27:31,740
That's how much I give a fuck about your family.

1222
01:27:31,820 --> 01:27:34,580
On my fucking family, it ain't the fucking piece!

1223
01:27:34,660 --> 01:27:38,120
How fucking far do we go back?. How fucking long have we known each other?.

1224
01:27:38,210 --> 01:27:40,250
Come on, what the fuck?.

1225
01:27:40,330 --> 01:27:42,710
- This is bullshit!  - Like I said...

1226
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:45,960
"Nobody knows nobody."

1227
01:27:48,130 --> 01:27:49,630
You fucking take this...

1228
01:27:51,590 --> 01:27:54,180
- Not in front of the fucking kid  - What kid?.

1229
01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:57,270
Listen, you knock this fucking gun out of my hand one more time,

1230
01:27:57,350 --> 01:28:00,390
I'm gonna blow your fucking brains all over this fucking place.

1231
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:04,070
And I'll fuck that kid up right in front of you! You got that, nigger?.

1232
01:28:04,150 --> 01:28:06,860
Nobody knows nobody! You got that?.

1233
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:14,660
Shit! What the fuck?.

1234
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:16,760
(Tommy chuckles)

1235
01:28:16,870 --> 01:28:18,370
Oh, shit.

1236
01:28:18,450 --> 01:28:20,500
You see, Pop...

1237
01:28:20,580 --> 01:28:23,460
reached out to a friend of ours in the department.

1238
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:26,210
Had him pull the paper on Rydell's recent busts.

1239
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:31,010
Turns out our friend Sal here was running his own little thing on the side.

1240
01:28:31,130 --> 01:28:32,680
Hey, Sal!

1241
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:34,300
How's fucking business?.

1242
01:28:34,390 --> 01:28:35,510
Huh?.

1243
01:28:36,310 --> 01:28:40,480
A few weeks back, Sal gets bagged by Rydell and his partners.

1244
01:28:41,270 --> 01:28:45,940
They let him walk as a situated informant.

1245
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,570
We just got confirmation ten minutes ago.

1246
01:28:49,650 --> 01:28:52,740
Hey, hey! Hey, hey! Get the fuck up.

1247
01:28:52,820 --> 01:28:54,820
Get the fuck up.

1248
01:28:55,990 --> 01:28:57,290
Yeah.

1249
01:28:57,370 --> 01:28:58,790
Yeah?.

1250
01:28:58,870 --> 01:29:00,710
Oh, he's alone?.

1251
01:29:01,460 --> 01:29:03,880
Go ahead. Give me the fucking number.

1252
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:14,390
Have a Mai Tai on me, guys.

1253
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:20,100
One Nike gym bag, 60 bucks.

1254
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:31,480
(Laughs)

1255
01:29:34,410 --> 01:29:37,330
You motherfucking guinea, cocksucking...

1256
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:42,290
One Nokia cellphone...1 00 bucks.

1257
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:44,400
(Cellphone rings)

1258
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,710
You have just fucked yourselves!

1259
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:51,880
One ounce of Semtex...

1260
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:53,720
..500 bucks.

1261
01:29:56,260 --> 01:29:59,850
Getting rid of a dirty cop...

1262
01:30:00,810 --> 01:30:03,140
... fucking priceless.

1263
01:30:04,230 --> 01:30:08,560
Now...the jury's still out on you, pal. So do me a favour.

1264
01:30:08,650 --> 01:30:11,530
Get your ass in that car and follow me. And hey! Hey!

1265
01:30:12,610 --> 01:30:14,200
Don't get lost.

1266
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:16,450
I'm not fucking gonna.

1267
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:58,720
(Players grunt violently)

1268
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:13,550
Come on down. Come on down.

1269
01:31:20,970 --> 01:31:22,390
How you doing?.

1270
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:29,440
So...

1271
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:32,060
You wanna see something really cool?.

1272
01:31:32,150 --> 01:31:33,570
Mm?.

1273
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:41,280
It's called Jet lce.

1274
01:31:41,370 --> 01:31:43,490
Black light paint.

1275
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:46,580
You gotta do crazy shit like this to fill the seats.

1276
01:31:54,380 --> 01:31:56,090
Now, Oleg...

1277
01:31:56,170 --> 01:31:59,340
this is very serious matter.

1278
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:01,840
This man.

1279
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:06,060
He give you the gun to shoot Anzor?.

1280
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:07,730
ANZOR: Bullshit.

1281
01:32:07,810 --> 01:32:10,730
He gave it to you! He told you to whack me!

1282
01:32:10,810 --> 01:32:15,400
- Stop fucking protecting him!  - You shut the fuck up.

1283
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:18,280
(Tommy laughs)

1284
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:20,820
Oleg. You listen to me.

1285
01:32:20,910 --> 01:32:22,490
Where did you get gun?.

1286
01:32:23,620 --> 01:32:26,580
At school. I found it in a locker.

1287
01:32:27,410 --> 01:32:29,910
Don't you fucking touch him! Don't touch him!

1288
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,750
- Touch him and I'll fucking kill you!  - You shut the fuck up!

1289
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:36,750
- Your turn is coming  - Yeah?. Well, fucking eat me!

1290
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:39,670
You fucking Vor cocksucking bitch, fuck you!

1291
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:44,050
- What did you call me?  - You heard me. Fuck you, you fucking bitch.

1292
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:47,390
I'm impressed. You know Vors.

1293
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:53,770
Vor v zakonye, the Brotherhood.

1294
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:55,900
If you were smart man,

1295
01:32:55,980 --> 01:32:58,820
you would learn to fear this symbol.

1296
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:01,610
Fuck you and fuck your brotherhood Vors.

1297
01:33:01,700 --> 01:33:04,280
Cos I don't fucking answer to you. Fuck you!

1298
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:07,910
Gonna let him muscle me around?.

1299
01:33:07,990 --> 01:33:10,910
We're just trying to establish some truth here, Joe.

1300
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:14,170
To be honest, I think the man's got some grounds for inquiry.

1301
01:33:14,250 --> 01:33:17,880
That's fucking bullshit! I told you, I didn't give the kid the fucking piece!

1302
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:19,130
Come on, Frankie!

1303
01:33:19,210 --> 01:33:23,130
Come on, what the fuck, Frankie?. I told you! I didn't give him the fucking piece.

1304
01:33:23,220 --> 01:33:26,430
Don't let him hurt the kid, Anzor. Don't you fucking hurt the kid!

1305
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:30,220
You fuck! You fucking motherfuckers!

1306
01:33:30,310 --> 01:33:32,980
I'm gonna fucking kill you! Oh, shit!

1307
01:33:34,020 --> 01:33:36,020
How's thatfeel, Joey?. Huh?.

1308
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:38,860
Fuck you, Tommy!

1309
01:33:39,530 --> 01:33:41,570
Don't you do this, Frankie.

1310
01:33:41,650 --> 01:33:43,150
Don't you do it!

1311
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:46,370
Don't  you fucking let him do this!

1312
01:33:46,450 --> 01:33:48,490
I'm not fucking lying!

1313
01:33:48,990 --> 01:33:50,580
I'm not fucking lying!

1314
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:52,250
Fuck!

1315
01:33:53,660 --> 01:33:56,460
Jesus, tell them what they wanna know!

1316
01:33:57,630 --> 01:34:00,670
Fuck, I told you I didn't know anything, Frankie!

1317
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:01,880
Fuck!

1318
01:34:04,550 --> 01:34:06,180
A fucking human hockey puck.

1319
01:34:06,260 --> 01:34:07,720
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

1320
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:11,140
Oh, you're gonna kill me?. You're gonna fucking kill me?.

1321
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:12,240
(Roars)

1322
01:34:12,350 --> 01:34:15,770
- Give Anzor the gun. Kill the kid  - Frankie, don't let him do this!

1323
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:22,150
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

1324
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:25,400
(T ommy cackles)

1325
01:34:27,490 --> 01:34:28,910
JOEY: Don't let them do this.

1326
01:34:28,990 --> 01:34:31,990
What do you want me to do?. You brought it on yourself.

1327
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:34,540
No, don't!

1328
01:34:34,620 --> 01:34:36,830
Don't do it! Don't!

1329
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:38,540
I'll fucking talk!

1330
01:34:38,630 --> 01:34:41,460
I'll fucking tell you whatever you wanna fucking hear!

1331
01:34:41,550 --> 01:34:44,550
No, my friend! First you will see that I am serious.

1332
01:34:44,630 --> 01:34:47,640
Then afterwards, believe me, you will talk!

1333
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:50,720
Oh, come on! Jesus Christ, I fucking told you!

1334
01:34:50,810 --> 01:34:55,770
I fucking told you, I'll tell you whatever you wanna hear, you fucking motherfucker.

1335
01:34:55,850 --> 01:34:57,560
Finish it! Do it right this time.

1336
01:34:58,350 --> 01:35:02,530
No, Anzor! Anzor, look at me! Don't fucking do it!

1337
01:35:02,610 --> 01:35:03,730
Shut up!

1338
01:35:05,110 --> 01:35:07,150
I said finish it.

1339
01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:09,120
He's not your blood!

1340
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:11,080
JOEY: Don't fucking do it!

1341
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:14,080
If you do it, I swear to God you better swallow a bullet!

1342
01:35:14,160 --> 01:35:16,750
There's no way you'd be able to live with yourself!

1343
01:35:16,830 --> 01:35:19,130
Trust me, Anzor! Don't do it!

1344
01:35:19,210 --> 01:35:21,290
Say something bad about the Duke.

1345
01:35:22,130 --> 01:35:25,010
Let me hear you call him a faggot.

1346
01:35:25,090 --> 01:35:26,340
Come on!

1347
01:35:29,090 --> 01:35:31,510
- Say it  - No.

1348
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,140
Shoot him!

1349
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:58,840
(Moans)

1350
01:36:00,420 --> 01:36:02,790
What are you fucking doing?.

1351
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:06,920
Pick up the fucking gun.

1352
01:36:07,010 --> 01:36:09,050
Pick it up.

1353
01:36:10,010 --> 01:36:11,760
You do it.

1354
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:17,850
Gutless piece of faggot shit!

1355
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:20,690
Come on, faggot!

1356
01:36:21,690 --> 01:36:23,560
I said finish it!

1357
01:36:25,190 --> 01:36:27,690
Pick it up and use it!

1358
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:32,820
Pick it up and do it.

1359
01:36:35,700 --> 01:36:38,160
Pick it up and do it!

1360
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:45,460
Don't you fucking walk away from me!

1361
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:02,840
(Gasps)

1362
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:07,190
Get up...

1363
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:09,360
you fuck.

1364
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:16,080
(Joey screams)

1365
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:17,950
Fucking bullshit.

1366
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:20,040
Fuck. Fuck!

1367
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:23,620
Fuck you, Frankie! I ain't taking the fucking heat for you no more.

1368
01:37:23,710 --> 01:37:26,380
It wasn't supposed to go down this way!

1369
01:37:27,170 --> 01:37:30,460
- What are you talking about?.  - Czar of Brighton...

1370
01:37:30,550 --> 01:37:33,260
Vor, whatever the fuck you are!

1371
01:37:33,340 --> 01:37:36,260
Fucking didn't like it, did you, your nephew was...

1372
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:38,970
was cooking and dealing in the neighbourhood.

1373
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:40,640
That's what he said.

1374
01:37:40,730 --> 01:37:43,020
He said, "Oleg, send him a message!"

1375
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:45,400
Said, "Let's use the kid. "

1376
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:46,560
Yugi...

1377
01:37:46,650 --> 01:37:51,070
Would I put our thing in jeopardy for some two-bit fucking meth lab?.

1378
01:37:51,150 --> 01:37:53,450
Think about it, OK?. That's number one.

1379
01:37:53,530 --> 01:37:55,030
Number two.

1380
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:59,290
I don't even live in that fucking neighbourhood! What do I care if it blows up?.

1381
01:37:59,370 --> 01:38:01,000
The gun.

1382
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:04,830
It was Tommy's! You fuck!

1383
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:10,800
Tommy! Tommy, don't get involved\nin a goddamn jock fight. It's all bullshit!

1384
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:12,970
He fucking put it in my right hand.

1385
01:38:13,050 --> 01:38:17,470
A fucking snub nose.38, stainless steel. It was Tommy's gun!

1386
01:38:17,550 --> 01:38:21,640
You motherfucker. I told you to get rid of that fucking piece.

1387
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:23,770
Yeah, well, not to my fucking recollection!

1388
01:38:23,850 --> 01:38:27,730
He said, "lnterest the tweaker's kid in the piece."

1389
01:38:27,810 --> 01:38:31,780
That's what he said. "lnterest the tweaker's kid in the piece."

1390
01:38:31,860 --> 01:38:33,030
Ask the kid!

1391
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:36,110
Ask the kid.

1392
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:38,740
Mr Gazelle, he gave me the gun.

1393
01:38:39,780 --> 01:38:44,790
He said I'd get to go to the game if... if I shot Anzor.

1394
01:38:44,870 --> 01:38:46,710
It would make his friends happy.

1395
01:38:46,790 --> 01:38:48,880
I'm sorry, kid.

1396
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:52,050
OK. OK. Fuck this bullshit.

1397
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,670
Fuck you, Joey, you fucking bastard!

1398
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:55,440
(Screams)

1399
01:38:55,550 --> 01:38:57,760
You're fucking dead, nigger!

1400
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:11,520
- Oh, I'm fucking shot!  - That's some bad motherfucker!

1401
01:39:11,610 --> 01:39:12,780
Fucking Vor!

1402
01:39:17,820 --> 01:39:19,120
Fuck you, cocksucker!

1403
01:39:27,210 --> 01:39:30,000
You son of a bitch!

1404
01:39:35,260 --> 01:39:38,260
You're dying, motherfucker!

1405
01:39:39,930 --> 01:39:42,220
Where's the fucking gun?.

1406
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:11,000
Mr Gazelle!

1407
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:31,680
(Gunshot)

1408
01:41:00,970 --> 01:41:03,010
Fuck you.

1409
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:05,080
(Joey groaning)

1410
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:10,060
Oh...

1411
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:16,000
(Mutters)

1412
01:41:20,860 --> 01:41:22,860
Get off him, you fuck!

1413
01:41:22,950 --> 01:41:26,410
Do you know you got my son killed, you fucking scumbag?.

1414
01:41:26,490 --> 01:41:28,120
Oh, Frankie.

1415
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:30,830
I'm glad it's you cos there's something I've been...

1416
01:41:30,910 --> 01:41:33,000
I've really been meaning to get off my chest.

1417
01:41:33,080 --> 01:41:37,040
You rat cocksucker! All of this fucking time!

1418
01:41:37,130 --> 01:41:38,960
Yeah, this whole fucking time!

1419
01:41:39,050 --> 01:41:41,130
This whole fucking time!

1420
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:45,090
But we don't have your finger on the trigger, so do me! It's one more nail in your coffin!

1421
01:41:45,180 --> 01:41:47,350
Oh, you got all that, do you?.

1422
01:41:47,430 --> 01:41:50,640
How come it took you so long, then, huh, tough guy?. Huh?.

1423
01:41:50,730 --> 01:41:53,140
How come?. So fucking long! Tell me!

1424
01:41:53,230 --> 01:41:55,650
You had to climb into bed with Yugorsky, didn't you?.

1425
01:41:55,730 --> 01:41:59,400
I was all but out and you had to go and mix it up with the fucking Russians.

1426
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:02,860
1 2 years undercover and my own wife don't even fucking know.

1427
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:05,450
Oh, you cocksucker. You don't have to worry.

1428
01:42:06,780 --> 01:42:09,580
She ain't never gonna hear it from your fucking lips anyhow!

1429
01:42:09,660 --> 01:42:11,700
You fucking scumbag!

1430
01:42:12,870 --> 01:42:16,380
I'll tell her all about it while she sucks my fucking dick!

1431
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:18,400
(Gun clicks)

1432
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:24,840
(Laughs softly)

1433
01:42:24,970 --> 01:42:27,640
Come on. Come on!

1434
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:30,010
Are you fucking kidding me?.

1435
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:35,650
What are you gonna do with that, little boy?.

1436
01:42:35,730 --> 01:42:37,940
You know that I had a little boy?. My Tommy.

1437
01:42:38,020 --> 01:42:40,530
At one time he was your age.

1438
01:42:40,610 --> 01:42:43,650
What are you gonna do with that, kid?. What are you gonna do?.

1439
01:42:43,740 --> 01:42:47,740
What are you gonna do with that, you Cheerio-bred, little motherfucker!

1440
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:53,760
(Gunshot)

1441
01:43:09,470 --> 01:43:11,510
Let's go home.

1442
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,040
(Pistol clinks on ice)

1443
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,040
(Helicopter whirring)

1444
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:40,160
(Sirens)

1445
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:46,080
(Police cock guns)

1446
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:47,800
COP:In position!

1447
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:50,430
All right. On the other side. Let's go!

1448
01:43:59,190 --> 01:44:01,440
Jesus Christ, Joey, we got shorted out.

1449
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:03,070
We lost you back in Newark.

1450
01:44:03,150 --> 01:44:04,940
You were headed for Little Odessa.

1451
01:44:05,030 --> 01:44:06,940
Air support finally made your Mustang.

1452
01:44:07,990 --> 01:44:10,030
I'm taking the kid home to his mom.

1453
01:44:10,990 --> 01:44:13,030
Joey, where are you going?.

1454
01:44:13,120 --> 01:44:15,330
You're hurt. We gotta get you to a hospital.

1455
01:44:17,410 --> 01:44:19,250
I'm going home.

1456
01:44:32,680 --> 01:44:34,640
What are you thinking?.

1457
01:44:34,720 --> 01:44:36,600
I don't wanna go home.

1458
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:40,980
Well, I'm next door to you, remember, and I'm gonna be keeping my eye on you.

1459
01:44:47,940 --> 01:44:51,860
Why don't we get breakfast before we have to start making with the heavy explaining?.

1460
01:44:51,950 --> 01:44:54,200
Get ourselves cleaned up a bit.

1461
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:22,230
Hey, listen.

1462
01:45:22,310 --> 01:45:25,190
I'm taking Nick to the game on Friday night.

1463
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:28,230
Maybe we could find another ticket.

1464
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:33,820
If you would like to go, that is.

1465
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:48,250
All right, that's good.

1466
01:45:49,340 --> 01:45:51,050
You want some more orange juice?.

1467
01:45:59,270 --> 01:46:01,020
All right.

1468
01:46:02,690 --> 01:46:04,350
Well, er...

1469
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:06,480
What do you say, we get out of here?.

1470
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:21,950
Well, lookie, lookie.

1471
01:46:22,040 --> 01:46:24,420
If it ain't little Charlie Bronson.

1472
01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:30,300
One thing about Lester. He always makes good on a promise.

1473
01:46:30,380 --> 01:46:31,710
Hey, asshole!

1474
01:46:33,970 --> 01:46:37,470
What the fuck are you doing?.

1475
01:46:37,550 --> 01:46:40,470
You fucking piece of shit!

1476
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:44,100
- You big fucking...   - Cocksucker!

1477
01:46:44,190 --> 01:46:48,150
In your face, motherfucker!

1478
01:46:53,690 --> 01:46:55,860
Say hello to my little friend.

1479
01:46:56,990 --> 01:47:00,490
That's real fucking original. What are you?. A fucking cartoon?.

1480
01:47:00,580 --> 01:47:03,580
I'm a Mac Daddy pimp. You know that.

1481
01:47:03,660 --> 01:47:06,000
And now I'm gonna cap your ass.

1482
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:09,670
When I'm finished with you, I'm gonna take your little punk friend

1483
01:47:09,750 --> 01:47:12,210
and I'm gonna put him in my posse.

1484
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:14,630
And I'm gonna pimp him out for a couple of months!

1485
01:47:14,720 --> 01:47:18,140
And then I'm gonna take your knife and cut him from ear to ear!

1486
01:47:18,220 --> 01:47:20,640
Just like I should have done yesterday, you fuck!

1487
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:23,390
I'm sure that sounds great to you in your pimp world.

1488
01:47:23,470 --> 01:47:26,690
But, listen. That's not the fucking thing you wanna do!

1489
01:47:26,770 --> 01:47:29,650
You wanna put down that fucking gun and walk away.

1490
01:47:29,730 --> 01:47:33,400
Cos I swear to fucking God, I'll fucking kill you! Stupid fucking pimp bitch!

1491
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:34,860
Wrong!

1492
01:47:34,940 --> 01:47:37,990
Only one of us is walking out of here. Guess who.

1493
01:47:38,070 --> 01:47:39,990
Oleg, get behind me.

1494
01:47:42,290 --> 01:47:44,160
Oleg, get behind me!

1495
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:49,120
(Chuckles)

1496
01:47:52,680 --> 01:47:53,960
(Gunshot)

1497
01:48:04,850 --> 01:48:06,230
Come on!

1498
01:48:06,980 --> 01:48:09,690
Oleg, talk to me. Come on! Talk to me!

1499
01:48:09,770 --> 01:48:11,560
You're gonna make it.

1500
01:48:11,650 --> 01:48:13,940
Joey, please. You're bleeding.

1501
01:48:14,820 --> 01:48:16,530
Fuck, fuck!

1502
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:20,820
OLEG: Look out! Look out!

1503
01:48:37,590 --> 01:48:41,090
Mr Gazelle! Stop the car. We need to get some help.

1504
01:48:41,180 --> 01:48:42,430
Tee...

1505
01:48:42,510 --> 01:48:44,720
- Please, Mr Gazelle!  - Tee...I'm coming home.

1506
01:48:45,640 --> 01:48:47,850
(Speaks softly in Russian)

1507
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:51,000
(Gas hissing)

1508
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:01,680
(Tyres squeal)

1509
01:49:01,780 --> 01:49:04,740
Mr Gazelle, please! Stop the car. We need to get some help.

1510
01:49:04,830 --> 01:49:07,450
- I've gotta tell her  - You're hurt!

1511
01:49:07,540 --> 01:49:09,710
I'm gonna make it home.

1512
01:49:11,370 --> 01:49:12,880
You're bleeding!

1513
01:49:25,970 --> 01:49:27,560
God.

1514
01:49:27,640 --> 01:49:29,640
Oh, God!

1515
01:49:30,390 --> 01:49:32,440
Nicky, stay back! Stay back!

1516
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:35,120
(Coughs)

1517
01:49:37,070 --> 01:49:39,530
Oh, my God.

1518
01:49:39,610 --> 01:49:41,110
Joey!

1519
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:44,490
Joey, please! Stop!

1520
01:49:44,570 --> 01:49:46,870
Mr Gazelle, wake up!

1521
01:49:52,670 --> 01:49:55,750
Mr Gazelle! Wake up! Come on!

1522
01:49:56,710 --> 01:49:58,050
Stop the car! Stop the car!

1523
01:49:58,130 --> 01:50:00,420
Please! Stop!

1524
01:50:00,510 --> 01:50:01,510
Joe?.

1525
01:50:01,590 --> 01:50:03,720
Mr Gazelle, watch out!

1526
01:50:05,850 --> 01:50:07,850
Joe! Joe!

1527
01:50:11,060 --> 01:50:13,270
Oleg, wait! Wait!

1528
01:50:13,350 --> 01:50:14,560
Oh, God!

1529
01:50:14,650 --> 01:50:16,480
Mom! Mom!

1530
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:18,270
Joe!

1531
01:50:18,360 --> 01:50:20,280
Jesus!

1532
01:50:21,110 --> 01:50:22,360
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

1533
01:50:22,450 --> 01:50:24,700
Nicky! Call 91 1!

1534
01:50:26,700 --> 01:50:28,450
Don't do this to me, Joe.

1535
01:50:28,530 --> 01:50:30,950
- Don't fucking do this to me  - Oh, sweetheart.

1536
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:32,540
I loved you.

1537
01:50:32,620 --> 01:50:33,500
OK?.

1538
01:50:33,580 --> 01:50:34,750
Just remember.

1539
01:50:34,830 --> 01:50:36,420
I was always the real Joey.

1540
01:50:36,500 --> 01:50:38,290
OK?. I wasn't a liar.

1541
01:50:38,380 --> 01:50:40,340
Shut up. Shut up. Look at me.

1542
01:50:40,420 --> 01:50:42,340
Look at me. Baby, look at me in the eye.

1543
01:50:42,420 --> 01:50:45,930
Joey, look at me in the eyes. I don't care, OK?. It doesn't matter.

1544
01:50:46,010 --> 01:50:48,140
I'm gonna kick your ass over it later.

1545
01:50:48,220 --> 01:50:49,890
Stay with me, Joey! Stay! Look at me!

1546
01:50:49,970 --> 01:50:52,520
Look at me, I'm right here! I'm right here for you!

1547
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:54,310
Nicky! Nicky, come here!

1548
01:50:54,390 --> 01:50:56,440
Nicky! Nicky!

1549
01:50:56,520 --> 01:50:58,810
- He's right here  - They're coming.

1550
01:50:58,900 --> 01:51:00,190
- They're on their way  - OK.

1551
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:03,490
We're still going to the game Friday, Dad?.

1552
01:51:03,570 --> 01:51:06,700
- I love you, Nick!  - It's OK.

1553
01:51:06,780 --> 01:51:09,120
- He wants to go to the game, baby  - Yeah.

1554
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:11,080
We're gonna go to the game.

1555
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:15,580
- And fucking kick their asses, right, Mom?  - They are going down big fucking time!

1556
01:51:16,670 --> 01:51:18,170
You have a bad mouth.

1557
01:51:18,250 --> 01:51:20,340
You have a... You have a bad mouth.

1558
01:51:22,420 --> 01:51:24,670
- It's not that bad. You'll be OK  - Joe?.

1559
01:51:31,430 --> 01:51:33,020
I'm right here.

1560
01:51:33,100 --> 01:51:35,600
- Stay right...  - I'm right here. I'm right here.

1561
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:38,520
Joe?.

1562
01:51:38,600 --> 01:51:40,060
- Joe?.

1563
01:51:40,150 --> 01:51:41,320
Joe?.

1564
01:51:41,400 --> 01:51:43,190
Joe?. Oh, God, no, no!

1565
01:51:46,900 --> 01:51:48,280
Oh, God, no!

1566
01:51:48,360 --> 01:51:50,740
Oh, God, Joe!

1567
01:51:57,420 --> 01:52:00,080
Get the kid outside! I don't want him going in there!

1568
01:52:54,280 --> 01:52:56,320
(Dog barking)

1569
01:52:59,310 --> 01:53:00,900
Luis!

1570
01:53:00,980 --> 01:53:03,230
Hey, Luis.

1571
01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:10,110
Hey. George?.

1572
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:12,820
- The alternator's in the car  - All right.

1573
01:53:18,120 --> 01:53:21,000
Don't ever ask me to bury you again, Joe.

1574
01:53:39,230 --> 01:53:41,560
- What did they put in that coffin really?  - What?.

1575
01:53:41,640 --> 01:53:43,900
- What did they put in the coffin?  - In the coffin?.

1576
01:53:43,980 --> 01:53:45,900
- Yeah  - Why?. Did it seem heavy?.

1577
01:53:45,980 --> 01:53:47,110
Yeah!

1578
01:53:47,190 --> 01:53:50,610
I don't know. I'm thinking, probably a couple of blue shirts.

1579
01:53:50,700 --> 01:53:53,530
Must have been Lashon and McCall.

1580
01:53:53,610 --> 01:53:55,700
- Does that sound good?  - And Kaimen.

1581
01:53:55,780 --> 01:53:58,040
- You want some of this too?  - For sure, Marishka.

1582
01:53:58,120 --> 01:53:59,750
Marishka, you want some of this too?

1583
01:53:59,830 --> 01:54:02,920
I'll take the both of you right now. How about that?

1584
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,250
Razors
