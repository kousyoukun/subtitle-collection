1
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,785
Come on! Come on, kid!

2
00:01:05,785 --> 00:01:07,318
The fuck?

3
00:01:07,318 --> 00:01:09,449
Look at me. Fuck!

4
00:01:10,736 --> 00:01:12,708
Come on, Oleg, stay with me.

5
00:01:13,248 --> 00:01:15,320
Come on. Come on!

6
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,302
Come on, kid.
We're going to make it.

7
00:01:22,302 --> 00:01:23,513
We're going to crash!

8
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:47,485
<i>Yeah, mon.</i>

9
00:01:47,485 --> 00:01:49,493
<i>Sweet like cola wine.</i>

10
00:01:50,686 --> 00:01:52,693
<i>Come on,
we count the hundreds only.</i>

11
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,057
<i>Jeez.</i>

12
00:01:59,646 --> 00:02:02,363
<i>Why don't they finish it?</i>

13
00:02:08,478 --> 00:02:10,136
<i>We're good.</i>

14
00:02:15,454 --> 00:02:17,242
<i>What you have there?</i>

15
00:02:17,242 --> 00:02:20,539
<i>It's all looking very good.</i>

16
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,199
Nobody fucking move!

17
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:24,125
- Eat the floor, fucker!
- Down on the ground!

18
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,045
- Get down!
- Now, you cocksuckers!

19
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:27,255
You heard him! Get down!

20
00:02:27,255 --> 00:02:29,082
You're making the biggest
fucking mistake--

21
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,230
Shut up!

22
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,993
Down, motherfuckers, down!

23
00:02:31,993 --> 00:02:34,363
Everybody,
eat the fucking floor!

24
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:35,509
Fucker!

25
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:39,378
Now, very fucking carefully,
reach into your jackets...

26
00:02:39,378 --> 00:02:42,804
and take out whatever you're packing
and slide it under the bed!

27
00:02:42,804 --> 00:02:43,860
Fuck you.

28
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,715
Come on, all of you!
Move it! Come on, fuckheads!

29
00:02:46,715 --> 00:02:49,815
Keep it moving! Now!

30
00:02:49,815 --> 00:02:52,056
You better spend it
real quick, shitbags.

31
00:02:52,056 --> 00:02:54,132
You ain't long
for this fucking world.

32
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,922
Yeah, right. I will be sure
to have a mai tai on you.

33
00:02:58,173 --> 00:03:00,955
All of you goombah fucks.

34
00:03:00,955 --> 00:03:03,290
Come on.
I will have one on you, too.

35
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,437
Go, go! Come on!

36
00:03:04,437 --> 00:03:05,654
Come on! Move, move, move!

37
00:03:05,654 --> 00:03:06,707
- Hurry!
- Fucking move!

38
00:03:06,707 --> 00:03:07,828
Get going! Move!

39
00:03:07,828 --> 00:03:10,105
Let's go, let's go,
let's go! Come on!

40
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:13,234
Come on! Now!

41
00:03:17,148 --> 00:03:18,871
Motherfucker!

42
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:29,168
No, man.

43
00:03:31,483 --> 00:03:33,425
You fuckers!
You motherfuckers!

44
00:03:33,425 --> 00:03:35,769
We don't give a fuck
about these niggers.

45
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:38,137
Now, you spill Perello blood...

46
00:03:38,137 --> 00:03:40,473
you're deep-6 invested.
Walk clean.

47
00:03:40,473 --> 00:03:42,449
Piss on Perello blood!
Fuck him!

48
00:03:44,795 --> 00:03:45,940
Shit!

49
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,888
God damn it!

50
00:03:49,851 --> 00:03:50,865
I don't think so.

51
00:03:52,346 --> 00:03:53,715
Son of a bitch!

52
00:03:53,715 --> 00:03:55,248
Motherfucker! Fuck you!

53
00:04:05,658 --> 00:04:06,799
Fuck!

54
00:04:07,802 --> 00:04:08,881
Come on!

55
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:10,776
Get up, you fuck!

56
00:04:10,776 --> 00:04:12,054
Come on!

57
00:04:31,065 --> 00:04:33,334
Guys, let's blow this cunt!

58
00:04:33,334 --> 00:04:34,929
What a fucking pussy!

59
00:04:34,929 --> 00:04:37,271
What? Where you going,
you fuck?

60
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:39,159
We can work this out!
Let's talk!

61
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:41,102
Fuck you!

62
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:45,652
Shut the fuck up!

63
00:04:48,697 --> 00:04:50,022
Where the fuck you reaching?

64
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,433
- Please--
- Tell you what...

65
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:54,839
have a mai tai on me...

66
00:04:59,672 --> 00:05:02,422
Fuck me. He's a cop.

67
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:05,934
A fucking cop?!

68
00:05:05,934 --> 00:05:07,699
Motherfucker!

69
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:10,289
Get the shit,
and let's go! Now!

70
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:11,473
Hurry the fuck up!

71
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,150
Fucking dirty mooks.

72
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,401
Cocksuckers!

73
00:05:20,401 --> 00:05:23,004
Is there one fucking honest cop
in this fucking city?

74
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:24,948
Joey.

75
00:05:26,135 --> 00:05:27,826
Give me your gat.

76
00:05:29,623 --> 00:05:31,762
Take this shit
and get rid of it.

77
00:05:31,762 --> 00:05:33,741
And do me a favor--
don't fuck it up.

78
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:38,213
No!

79
00:05:45,622 --> 00:05:47,248
Give, loser punk!

80
00:05:47,248 --> 00:05:49,588
Never...dickwad!

81
00:05:53,527 --> 00:05:54,704
Sorry. You OK?

82
00:05:57,046 --> 00:05:58,508
Shit.

83
00:05:58,508 --> 00:06:00,721
I didn't mean to do that.

84
00:06:20,885 --> 00:06:23,024
Call now.

85
00:06:24,406 --> 00:06:25,999
Hey, boss.

86
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:28,431
What are you doing there?

87
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:30,291
Whacking off
to the E! Channel again?

88
00:07:01,684 --> 00:07:03,375
I just want to smell you.
Stay just like that.

89
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,038
You didn't call,
you son of a bitch.

90
00:07:23,156 --> 00:07:24,170
Let me guess.

91
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,586
Those are my pearls
you have been promising?

92
00:07:25,586 --> 00:07:28,434
No. No, it's nothing.
Just a little recycling.

93
00:07:28,434 --> 00:07:30,834
Joey, come on.
You are looking for trouble...

94
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:32,427
because if Tommy ever found out
about that--

95
00:07:33,563 --> 00:07:36,050
Just remember it's just our little
insurance policy, all right?

96
00:07:36,383 --> 00:07:37,700
because there's no way in hell
I am going to be thinking

97
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,523
about getting
some of this right here...

98
00:07:40,523 --> 00:07:41,991
looking at you through
some glass window.

99
00:07:41,991 --> 00:07:43,889
There's no fucking way.

100
00:08:13,778 --> 00:08:16,396
No, Joey, come on.
No, no, no...

101
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:17,808
No. No!

102
00:08:17,808 --> 00:08:19,914
Come on, baby.
Baby, look. Look at me.

103
00:08:19,914 --> 00:08:21,164
- What?
- Nicky's around.

104
00:08:21,164 --> 00:08:22,314
No, Nicky's busy.

105
00:08:22,314 --> 00:08:23,662
Come on, I will be quick
and real quiet. Come on.

106
00:08:23,662 --> 00:08:26,185
Quiet? I don't think so.
Quick, I can believe.

107
00:08:26,185 --> 00:08:27,916
You know something, Mrs. G?

108
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,862
- What?
- You're bad.

109
00:08:30,605 --> 00:08:32,688
Yeah, yeah... Sure.

110
00:08:32,688 --> 00:08:35,372
- I got a rep.
- Yeah? You got a rep.

111
00:08:35,372 --> 00:08:37,678
- Yeah, some things--
- You got a crazy rep.

112
00:08:37,678 --> 00:08:41,607
Teresa likes to make it
on washing machines.

113
00:08:41,607 --> 00:08:43,754
On select occasions, yeah.

114
00:08:46,033 --> 00:08:47,113
- No, no.
- What?

115
00:08:47,113 --> 00:08:49,225
My sauce! My sauce is bubbling!

116
00:08:49,225 --> 00:08:50,377
Wait, that's how I like it!

117
00:08:50,377 --> 00:08:52,010
Yeah.

118
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,543
Fuck! Come on!

119
00:08:53,543 --> 00:08:56,039
Hey! You use language
like that...

120
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:58,568
you ain't getting
no after-dinner dessert.

121
00:08:59,888 --> 00:09:00,903
Go find Nicky.

122
00:09:00,903 --> 00:09:02,853
I think he's up
in the bedroom with Oleg.

123
00:09:02,853 --> 00:09:04,457
Why's he always
with that Russkie kid?

124
00:09:04,457 --> 00:09:05,903
Don't he have no other friends?

125
00:09:05,903 --> 00:09:08,041
Joey, you know, they get along.

126
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,934
It's fine. What do you want?

127
00:09:09,934 --> 00:09:12,870
I don't want him going over there
no more, that's what I want.

128
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,189
I know. He knows.

129
00:09:15,632 --> 00:09:16,908
He knows.

130
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,702
I will go get him.

131
00:09:28,687 --> 00:09:30,345
Yo, Nick.

132
00:09:30,345 --> 00:09:31,725
Dinner.

133
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,209
Shit.

134
00:09:45,775 --> 00:09:47,084
Come on.

135
00:09:49,327 --> 00:09:50,636
Get down.

136
00:10:43,069 --> 00:10:44,343
Dinner.

137
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,757
Can Oleg stay?

138
00:10:46,757 --> 00:10:48,706
Babe, it's already been
3 times this week.

139
00:10:48,706 --> 00:10:51,302
I am sure his mom would like
to have him home for a change.

140
00:10:51,302 --> 00:10:54,187
It's OK. I am not even hungry.

141
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:57,089
I will see you tomorrow.
Go Razors.

142
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:00,002
You, go wash up.
Those hands are scary.

143
00:11:01,997 --> 00:11:05,379
- Good night, Oleg.
- Good night, Mrs. Gazelle.

144
00:11:09,804 --> 00:11:11,048
He's not even up there.

145
00:11:11,048 --> 00:11:13,059
They turned the damn basement
into a sports complex again.

146
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:14,212
Well...

147
00:11:14,212 --> 00:11:15,845
Come on, T, how many times
am I supposed to tell him?

148
00:11:15,845 --> 00:11:18,633
Joe, what do you want?
They're just boys. They--

149
00:11:28,876 --> 00:11:30,534
Dad, I won't do it again,
I swear.

150
00:11:30,534 --> 00:11:32,327
Don't you expect me
to make book on that.

151
00:11:32,327 --> 00:11:33,574
Now go get your grandfather.

152
00:11:33,574 --> 00:11:35,172
I just washed my hands.

153
00:11:37,579 --> 00:11:38,593
All right.

154
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:45,447
Hey, Nick.

155
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,386
Razors and Blues Friday night?

156
00:11:49,386 --> 00:11:50,662
120 yellow, pal.

157
00:11:50,662 --> 00:11:51,502
No way!

158
00:11:53,098 --> 00:11:56,066
It's going to be a total deathmatch
between Chester and Erlich.

159
00:11:56,066 --> 00:11:58,757
- They're going home in body bags!
- Red ice!

160
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:03,103
Hey... can Oleg come?
He's never been to one game, and--

161
00:12:03,103 --> 00:12:04,520
No. No, not this time.

162
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,114
Sal can only score me
a pair of tickets.

163
00:12:06,114 --> 00:12:07,715
Maybe next time, though.

164
00:12:09,322 --> 00:12:11,461
Go get your grandfather.

165
00:12:26,377 --> 00:12:28,068
Get up.

166
00:12:28,505 --> 00:12:29,585
Get up.

167
00:12:32,777 --> 00:12:34,435
Come on.

168
00:12:35,925 --> 00:12:37,413
Come on, man.

169
00:12:37,413 --> 00:12:38,943
Make it different this time.

170
00:12:42,921 --> 00:12:44,165
Get up.

171
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:48,291
Get up.

172
00:12:53,832 --> 00:12:56,353
I said, get up!

173
00:12:57,385 --> 00:12:58,497
What is this?

174
00:12:58,497 --> 00:13:00,511
Wolfgang Puck.
It's your favorite.

175
00:13:00,511 --> 00:13:02,821
It's thick-crust...

176
00:13:02,821 --> 00:13:04,710
you damn blyad.

177
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,875
I cut off crust for you.
It will be better.

178
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,355
Bring me another Moskova.

179
00:13:20,872 --> 00:13:21,952
Hey.

180
00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:23,512
Hey.

181
00:13:25,863 --> 00:13:27,456
Come here.

182
00:13:29,447 --> 00:13:31,040
Come here.

183
00:13:32,775 --> 00:13:34,335
Come.

184
00:13:36,807 --> 00:13:38,814
Watch this.

185
00:13:39,911 --> 00:13:41,983
John Wayne in The Cowboys.

186
00:13:43,303 --> 00:13:44,764
I don't like cowboys.

187
00:13:44,764 --> 00:13:46,694
Come on.

188
00:13:46,694 --> 00:13:48,614
It's the Duke.

189
00:13:48,614 --> 00:13:50,686
Come. Sit.

190
00:14:01,222 --> 00:14:03,775
When I was growing up
in Kishinev...

191
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:06,848
we had no VHS,
no DVD back then.

192
00:14:06,848 --> 00:14:09,886
I remember...

193
00:14:09,886 --> 00:14:13,308
I did a job for
this friend of my father.

194
00:14:13,308 --> 00:14:16,546
I pickpocketed a key
off this apparatchik.

195
00:14:16,546 --> 00:14:19,843
The man gave me as a reward...

196
00:14:19,843 --> 00:14:23,074
this children's projector.

197
00:14:23,074 --> 00:14:26,306
It came with 3 films--

198
00:14:26,306 --> 00:14:28,894
Speedy Gonzales,
Tarzan of the Apes...

199
00:14:28,894 --> 00:14:31,105
and John Wayne in The Cowboys.

200
00:14:31,105 --> 00:14:33,923
I watched that thing...

201
00:14:33,923 --> 00:14:36,575
a thousand times.

202
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:39,929
Anzor, it's getting cold.

203
00:14:47,396 --> 00:14:49,698
I was 9 years old.

204
00:14:49,698 --> 00:14:52,667
I didn't know how long
movies were supposed to be.

205
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:56,538
My version of The Cowboys,
it was only 10 minutes long.

206
00:14:56,538 --> 00:15:00,443
No John Wayne getting shot.

207
00:15:00,443 --> 00:15:04,510
Because it was for kids,
they left that part out.

208
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,109
I didn't know this...

209
00:15:08,004 --> 00:15:10,753
until I arrive in America...

210
00:15:10,753 --> 00:15:15,741
and see it on TV
for the first time.

211
00:15:15,741 --> 00:15:17,154
I hate it.

212
00:15:17,154 --> 00:15:21,890
I want my 8-millimeter back.

213
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:25,436
Because on that one,
the Duke lives.

214
00:15:27,587 --> 00:15:30,621
Some things were better
in the old place.

215
00:15:30,621 --> 00:15:34,554
Not too many. Some things.

216
00:15:34,554 --> 00:15:37,824
Let me show you
from the beginning.

217
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,088
No, no...

218
00:15:44,088 --> 00:15:46,497
Go forward.

219
00:15:46,497 --> 00:15:48,538
This part's better.

220
00:15:51,426 --> 00:15:52,855
Without the Duke?

221
00:16:00,482 --> 00:16:02,206
Where are you going?!

222
00:16:02,206 --> 00:16:04,511
You don't walk out on the Duke!

223
00:16:11,874 --> 00:16:14,939
She said he's always distracted
and he never finishes his work...

224
00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:17,531
and she wants to get him tested.

225
00:16:17,531 --> 00:16:20,603
Wait, she wants to get him tested?
Tested for what?

226
00:16:20,603 --> 00:16:24,155
I think maybe...
attention disorder or something.

227
00:16:24,155 --> 00:16:25,470
I am not fucking A.D.D.

228
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,927
Hey! You don't use that word
in front of your mother.

229
00:16:27,927 --> 00:16:29,049
What's wrong with "A.D.D."?

230
00:16:29,049 --> 00:16:31,307
The other one, smart-ass!

231
00:16:31,841 --> 00:16:33,368
And he don't use that word, period!

232
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:34,871
I don't want to be on medication.

233
00:16:34,871 --> 00:16:36,222
You can't make me take it,
because I won't.

234
00:16:36,222 --> 00:16:37,981
No, no, Nick. You know what?
Don't even worry about.

235
00:16:37,981 --> 00:16:41,181
There's no way in hell anybody's
going to put you on meds, OK?

236
00:16:41,181 --> 00:16:42,428
T, why don't you tell
that teacher...

237
00:16:42,428 --> 00:16:44,287
to come down to the rink
and watch him wax that puck?

238
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,847
That's perfect concentration
every time.

239
00:16:45,847 --> 00:16:47,318
That's different, Joe.

240
00:16:47,561 --> 00:16:50,776
We're just--we're just trying
to find out what's going on with you.

241
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:52,726
OK? Buddy, she said
some great things, too.

242
00:16:52,726 --> 00:16:54,230
She said--she said
that he's very bright.

243
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,214
She said he's very creative.

244
00:16:56,214 --> 00:16:58,907
You left that part out before.
I like that part.

245
00:16:58,907 --> 00:17:00,854
I got potential.

246
00:17:13,536 --> 00:17:15,063
What are you doing?

247
00:17:15,063 --> 00:17:17,471
You taking a collection
down there?

248
00:17:39,455 --> 00:17:41,789
He must eat.

249
00:17:44,543 --> 00:17:46,746
The little prick...

250
00:17:46,746 --> 00:17:49,052
insults the Duke.

251
00:17:50,398 --> 00:17:53,529
He don't eat in this house.

252
00:17:55,614 --> 00:17:59,324
You hear me,
you little snotface?!

253
00:17:59,324 --> 00:18:01,180
Stay in your room!

254
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,635
Jerk off to your fucking Razors!

255
00:18:03,635 --> 00:18:05,783
Faggot!

256
00:18:05,783 --> 00:18:08,342
He's a growing boy.

257
00:18:21,758 --> 00:18:24,627
What did I fucking say, suka?

258
00:18:24,627 --> 00:18:27,004
He has to eat, Anzor.

259
00:18:27,004 --> 00:18:28,314
Please.

260
00:18:28,314 --> 00:18:30,902
Who puts food
on this fucking table?

261
00:18:33,597 --> 00:18:36,979
Not you, blyad.

262
00:18:36,979 --> 00:18:38,963
I am the big man of this house.

263
00:18:38,963 --> 00:18:41,972
When I say the little shit
don't eat, he don't eat.

264
00:18:41,972 --> 00:18:43,868
Anzor.

265
00:18:45,597 --> 00:18:47,539
John Wayne was a faggot.

266
00:18:49,597 --> 00:18:51,320
So, Vicki Goletto
told me she saw you...

267
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,080
walking hand-in-hand
with Jeannie's daughter.

268
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,196
The fat one?

269
00:18:57,181 --> 00:18:58,774
That sounded like a gun.

270
00:19:00,636 --> 00:19:03,418
Hey, Nick, throw me some bread.

271
00:19:05,036 --> 00:19:06,741
Shit! Get down!

272
00:19:06,741 --> 00:19:09,115
Get down! You OK? You OK?!

273
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:10,457
Jesus, Joe. What the hell?

274
00:19:10,457 --> 00:19:12,150
Stay here. Motherfucker.

275
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,366
Motherfucker!

276
00:19:13,366 --> 00:19:15,062
I am going to kill
that fucking piece of shit!

277
00:19:15,062 --> 00:19:18,002
- Where are you going?
- You Russian piece of shit!

278
00:19:18,002 --> 00:19:19,156
Gun.

279
00:19:19,931 --> 00:19:23,030
Shoot my fucking house.
I am going to fucking kill you.

280
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,212
Dad, wait!

281
00:19:24,212 --> 00:19:25,910
Get back in the house.

282
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:28,281
Get back in the house!

283
00:19:28,281 --> 00:19:29,744
Get back in now! Go!

284
00:19:32,411 --> 00:19:35,226
Stay right here.
Don't you move, son, OK?

285
00:19:35,226 --> 00:19:37,114
You fucking piece of shit.
I am going to fucking kill you!

286
00:19:37,114 --> 00:19:39,035
- Nicky, get inside.
- Fucking piece of shit!

287
00:19:39,035 --> 00:19:40,474
Joe! Joe!

288
00:19:40,474 --> 00:19:42,416
What's the matter with you?
I just called 911.

289
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:43,407
Leave it for the cops!

290
00:19:43,407 --> 00:19:45,077
Get the kid and take him
back in the house!

291
00:19:45,077 --> 00:19:46,424
You fucking piece of shit!

292
00:19:46,424 --> 00:19:48,214
I am going to kill you!
Open the fucking door!

293
00:19:48,214 --> 00:19:49,429
- Oleg's my friend!
- I will kick it in!

294
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:51,125
- He's my friend!
- Open the door!

295
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,471
Joey, don't be a damn hero!

296
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:55,540
Open up! It's Joey Gazelle
from next door! Open up!

297
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,888
Open up!

298
00:19:58,619 --> 00:20:00,724
Get back! Get back!

299
00:20:01,914 --> 00:20:03,321
Where is he? Is he upstairs?

300
00:20:03,321 --> 00:20:04,402
He's in--

301
00:20:04,402 --> 00:20:05,522
- What?
- He's--

302
00:20:05,522 --> 00:20:06,674
Listen, get down.

303
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:14,744
What the fuck?

304
00:20:14,744 --> 00:20:17,080
Where's the kid?

305
00:20:23,418 --> 00:20:24,563
Where's the kid?

306
00:20:24,563 --> 00:20:27,089
Fuck him.
I am the one who's shot.

307
00:20:27,089 --> 00:20:28,558
Who is he?
Is he still in the house?

308
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:30,903
The little snotfuck
ran out back.

309
00:20:30,903 --> 00:20:32,153
Oleg?

310
00:20:33,497 --> 00:20:36,596
Oleg? What are you trying to say?
Oleg shot you?

311
00:20:36,596 --> 00:20:38,389
What are you...

312
00:20:38,389 --> 00:20:40,564
a fucking idiot?

313
00:20:40,564 --> 00:20:42,576
I didn't do this to myself.

314
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:46,032
The little prick
put a gun to me, too.

315
00:20:46,032 --> 00:20:47,534
Look at him.

316
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,410
She used to fucking make--

317
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:18,066
Where'd he get the piece?
Where'd he get the fucking piece?!

318
00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:20,045
- Fuck should I know?!
- What, it wasn't yours?

319
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:22,062
No! No way!

320
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,706
I got a .357
in the safe out back.

321
00:21:26,706 --> 00:21:29,645
He had some fucking
snub-nosed thing.

322
00:21:30,743 --> 00:21:33,198
Silver. Chrome.

323
00:21:50,967 --> 00:21:51,981
This is bullshit, Nick!

324
00:21:51,981 --> 00:21:53,364
Now you tell me!
I am not playing around!

325
00:21:53,364 --> 00:21:56,017
We saw where you put the gun,
but he didn't take anything--

326
00:21:56,017 --> 00:21:57,363
not with me.

327
00:21:57,363 --> 00:21:58,740
Well, he went back, Nicky.

328
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,123
Well, I didn't know.
I swear I didn't know.

329
00:22:02,123 --> 00:22:03,791
Come here. Listen to me.

330
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:06,764
Listen to me. That piece,
that's not just any hot piece.

331
00:22:06,764 --> 00:22:08,399
Tommy used it
to burn a dirty cop.

332
00:22:08,399 --> 00:22:09,899
- No. Joe.
- Yeah.

333
00:22:09,899 --> 00:22:11,730
Yeah. No, no. Listen, listen.
On top of it...

334
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,838
that kid's out there right now.
The cops are on their way.

335
00:22:13,838 --> 00:22:16,146
If they find the gun
or they find the kid...

336
00:22:16,146 --> 00:22:18,069
and he talks, I am dead.

337
00:22:18,069 --> 00:22:19,084
Fuck!

338
00:22:19,084 --> 00:22:20,336
Calm down! Calm down.

339
00:22:20,336 --> 00:22:21,356
- Yeah.
- Calm down.

340
00:22:21,356 --> 00:22:22,445
We can get to him.

341
00:22:22,445 --> 00:22:24,078
You can get to the gun
before the cops do.

342
00:22:24,518 --> 00:22:25,528
Shit.

343
00:22:34,197 --> 00:22:35,197
Hey.

344
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:40,527
Hey, so where you
going to take him?

345
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:41,809
Grimley Memorial.

346
00:22:41,809 --> 00:22:43,568
Hey, Mila, you know, I think
you should go with him, OK?

347
00:22:43,568 --> 00:22:44,815
Nyet. Ya padazhdu.

348
00:22:44,815 --> 00:22:46,347
Yeah, no, you should go with him.
I am going to go look for Oleg.

349
00:22:46,347 --> 00:22:47,883
Me and Nicky are going to
go find him, OK?

350
00:22:47,883 --> 00:22:49,780
And I will get Teresa to stay here
in case he comes back, all right?

351
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,925
- All right, you should go.
- OK. Thank you, Joey.

352
00:22:50,925 --> 00:22:52,208
- Yeah, no problem.
- I am sorry.

353
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:53,455
Yeah, no problem.

354
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:56,427
Yeah, we're going to find him.
Don't worry about it.

355
00:23:01,268 --> 00:23:02,315
Fuck.

356
00:23:06,836 --> 00:23:08,013
Come on.

357
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,307
Police officers.

358
00:23:16,307 --> 00:23:17,801
Sir, you live here?

359
00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:20,527
No, no. Actually, I live next door.
I heard some gunshots...

360
00:23:20,527 --> 00:23:22,222
so I came over, you know,
to see what's going on.

361
00:23:22,222 --> 00:23:23,372
What did you see?

362
00:23:25,911 --> 00:23:27,306
I saw Anzor, my neighbor.

363
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:29,616
He was in the kitchen.
He--he's been shot.

364
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:30,764
He say who did it?

365
00:23:30,764 --> 00:23:32,592
Nah. He was screaming
in Russian.

366
00:23:32,592 --> 00:23:34,449
His wife, she asked me
to stick around for the kid.

367
00:23:34,449 --> 00:23:35,530
He's out somewhere.

368
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:37,960
- You don't know who shot him?
- No.

369
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,977
I am going to need to take
a statement outside.

370
00:23:39,977 --> 00:23:41,743
I can't have you
messing up the scene, OK?

371
00:23:41,743 --> 00:23:42,728
All right.

372
00:23:42,728 --> 00:23:44,232
Hey, check it out.

373
00:23:46,611 --> 00:23:48,334
I don't see nothing inside.

374
00:23:48,334 --> 00:23:50,542
Maybe all the way back.

375
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:52,335
Got it.

376
00:23:52,335 --> 00:23:54,891
Leave it for forensics.

377
00:23:56,114 --> 00:23:58,733
Sir, I need for you
to wait outside.

378
00:23:58,733 --> 00:24:01,072
All right. No problem.

379
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:10,896
Fucking having a heart attack.

380
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:14,476
- I can't--I can't--
- Breathe.

381
00:24:14,476 --> 00:24:17,547
I got to find this kid, T.
I got to find this kid tonight.

382
00:24:17,547 --> 00:24:19,887
Nick, I need to know places,
all right?

383
00:24:19,887 --> 00:24:21,678
I need to know hideouts.
Go to your room right now...

384
00:24:21,678 --> 00:24:23,753
and make a list.
Nick, make a list!

385
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:24,971
OK.

386
00:24:24,971 --> 00:24:26,187
I am not fucking around, Nick.

387
00:24:26,187 --> 00:24:27,851
Joe, just--
just take it easy.

388
00:24:27,851 --> 00:24:29,198
There's no fucking time!

389
00:24:36,913 --> 00:24:38,701
All right,
I want you to wait next door...

390
00:24:38,701 --> 00:24:41,038
and the second he shows up,
call me.

391
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,477
I got to fucking
do something about this.

392
00:24:46,477 --> 00:24:49,098
I can't have the kid
fucking talking to the cops.

393
00:24:49,098 --> 00:24:51,854
You understand me?
The fucking gun is on the street.

394
00:24:51,854 --> 00:24:54,507
This whole fucking goddamn thing
is about to fucking blow up.

395
00:24:54,507 --> 00:24:56,071
If fucking Tommy
or any of those fucking guys...

396
00:24:56,071 --> 00:24:57,803
find out about it,
I am a dead man.

397
00:24:57,803 --> 00:25:01,036
You got to fucking help me.

398
00:25:01,036 --> 00:25:02,795
If I fucking have to.

399
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,091
Hey, grab your jacket, Nick.
We're going for a ride.

400
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,869
All right, Nick.

401
00:25:24,869 --> 00:25:26,700
I want you to stay in the car,
all right?

402
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,524
Don't get out for anything...

403
00:25:28,524 --> 00:25:30,566
and if I am not back in one hour,
I want you to call your mother.

404
00:25:30,566 --> 00:25:33,193
She will come and get you, OK?

405
00:25:33,193 --> 00:25:34,246
Excuse me.

406
00:25:34,246 --> 00:25:36,109
OK, take her to burn now.

407
00:25:36,109 --> 00:25:37,353
You're going to be fine.

408
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:51,691
Dr. Gutierrez, 745.
Dr. Gutierrez, 745.

409
00:25:52,527 --> 00:25:53,632
Excuse me.

410
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:58,292
Who's in the other room?
Is that Yugorsky, gunshot victim?

411
00:25:58,292 --> 00:26:00,008
Teenager, DUI car wreck.

412
00:26:00,008 --> 00:26:02,185
I think they just lost a GSW in 3.

413
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:05,222
Lost? He--he's dead?

414
00:26:05,562 --> 00:26:06,377
Yeah.

415
00:26:06,377 --> 00:26:07,780
No, wait.
He took a bullet right here.

416
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,610
No, a major trauma to chest.

417
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,810
Been in surgery all day.
Guy was a cop.

418
00:26:13,146 --> 00:26:15,334
Wait. No. Yeah,
they did bring someone in...

419
00:26:15,334 --> 00:26:16,716
about 40 minutes ago.

420
00:26:16,716 --> 00:26:18,953
O.R. number 2. I think
he's gone upstairs already.

421
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:20,069
That's this way?

422
00:26:47,628 --> 00:26:49,701
Can I help you...
Dr. Donaldson?

423
00:26:49,701 --> 00:26:51,496
Yeah. The cops
are waiting outside...

424
00:26:51,496 --> 00:26:53,988
and they need to run a match
on this bullet ASAP.

425
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:55,720
Well, I will make sure
they get it right away.

426
00:27:13,068 --> 00:27:14,628
Excuse me.

427
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:28,224
You looking for this?
Yugorsky, GSW, shoulder?

428
00:27:30,412 --> 00:27:33,226
You got to help me
find him, Nick.

429
00:27:33,226 --> 00:27:34,950
What are you going to do to him?

430
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,132
I am not going to do nothing.

431
00:27:36,132 --> 00:27:37,666
I just need to get my gun back
and bring him home.

432
00:27:39,563 --> 00:27:40,642
You sure?

433
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:43,556
Talk to me, Nick.

434
00:27:45,227 --> 00:27:47,976
It's this old abandoned
rec center in the park.

435
00:27:47,976 --> 00:27:52,266
Me and Oleg would hang out
there sometimes, read comics.

436
00:27:52,266 --> 00:27:53,443
He might be there.

437
00:28:14,058 --> 00:28:15,138
Nice gun.

438
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,469
Lo Chan to Admitting.

439
00:28:27,242 --> 00:28:30,111
Detective Rydell, Narcotics.

440
00:28:30,111 --> 00:28:32,706
I already made a statement.

441
00:28:33,993 --> 00:28:36,710
I don't know
who the shooter was.

442
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,720
Fucking niggers
all look the same.

443
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,874
Yeah.

444
00:28:39,874 --> 00:28:41,287
Anzor Yugorsky.

445
00:28:41,287 --> 00:28:43,208
Any relation to Ivan Yugorsky?

446
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:44,801
My uncle.

447
00:28:44,801 --> 00:28:46,596
The Czar of Brighton Beach.

448
00:28:46,596 --> 00:28:48,226
I been to his club
a couple of times.

449
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,982
Nice joint.
He even sang a few songs.

450
00:28:52,137 --> 00:28:53,860
He sings like a fucking toad.

451
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,652
Well, Sinatra he's not...

452
00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:57,827
but he's a man
with a serious reputation.

453
00:28:57,827 --> 00:29:00,767
- He has a lot of enemies.
- Bullshit.

454
00:29:00,767 --> 00:29:04,190
I told you. It was just
some fucking crackhead.

455
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,785
Yeah, well, I spoke
to the officers on the scene.

456
00:29:06,785 --> 00:29:08,547
There was no sign
of forced entry...

457
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:11,300
but they did find some
interesting shit out back--

458
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:14,751
6 cases of NyQuil,
and it ain't even cold season.

459
00:29:14,751 --> 00:29:17,126
Now, what do you think a search warrant
is going to turn up?

460
00:29:20,584 --> 00:29:23,169
Dr. Cookson,
call Imaging Services.

461
00:29:23,169 --> 00:29:26,305
Dr. Cookson,
call Imaging Services.

462
00:29:42,407 --> 00:29:44,960
- Come on, where?
- It's this way.

463
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,428
Let's go.

464
00:29:46,428 --> 00:29:47,900
Quick, come on.

465
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:51,522
Come on.

466
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:54,947
Go, go, go.

467
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:00,001
This way.

468
00:30:00,001 --> 00:30:02,242
Be cool...

469
00:30:02,242 --> 00:30:06,556
and let me do all the talking.

470
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:08,605
I am going to get you out of here.

471
00:30:08,605 --> 00:30:10,272
Help you?

472
00:30:10,272 --> 00:30:13,027
- Yeah.
- How much you got?

473
00:30:15,706 --> 00:30:17,595
I got a lot.

474
00:30:19,738 --> 00:30:21,248
Yes.

475
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:30,142
Oleg, it's Nicky.
Are you in there?

476
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:40,858
- Is this the spot?
- Yeah.

477
00:30:43,301 --> 00:30:44,959
Now, where's the stash?

478
00:30:44,959 --> 00:30:46,426
Last stall, motherfucker.

479
00:30:46,426 --> 00:30:48,508
Go. Find the stash.

480
00:30:48,508 --> 00:30:50,589
Find it.

481
00:30:50,589 --> 00:30:51,309
Go on.

482
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:53,759
Find it.

483
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:55,258
Find it!

484
00:31:01,572 --> 00:31:02,652
Fuck.

485
00:31:08,388 --> 00:31:10,624
We're going to search
this entire fucking park.

486
00:31:10,624 --> 00:31:11,707
He might still be around.

487
00:31:18,531 --> 00:31:21,433
What the fuck do you think
you're doing, white boy?

488
00:31:21,433 --> 00:31:23,963
All right, drop it, man,
or I will fucking waste the midget!

489
00:31:23,963 --> 00:31:25,465
Come on!

490
00:31:26,947 --> 00:31:28,606
He's just a tagalong.

491
00:31:28,606 --> 00:31:30,715
Plug them, Dale!
Plug the motherfucker!

492
00:31:30,715 --> 00:31:32,217
Fuck him up!

493
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:35,101
I will fuck you up, man!
Just let my boy go!

494
00:31:36,099 --> 00:31:37,692
Pop a cap in his ass!

495
00:31:39,587 --> 00:31:40,634
Wait, motherfucker, wait!

496
00:31:40,634 --> 00:31:42,562
Man, shoot this motherfucker!
Shoot that--

497
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:55,454
All right, stay right by me.
Here. Against the wall.

498
00:31:55,454 --> 00:31:57,465
You stay right there. Don't you move.
You stay right there.

499
00:31:58,562 --> 00:32:00,351
Fuck.

500
00:32:01,538 --> 00:32:03,098
Hey, hey,
I didn't do nothing, officer.

501
00:32:03,098 --> 00:32:04,349
I--I--I just came--

502
00:32:04,349 --> 00:32:07,070
You put your fucking hands
against the stall now!

503
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,732
Put your fucking head down!

504
00:32:10,594 --> 00:32:11,870
Oleg.

505
00:32:13,282 --> 00:32:15,224
I--I told you to stay outside.

506
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:17,568
- Did you find him?
- Get the fuck outside!

507
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:18,976
Get out of here!

508
00:32:18,976 --> 00:32:20,438
I am fucking talking to you!
Turn around. What'd you see?

509
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:24,279
Did you find the gun?
Did you find the silver gun?

510
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:25,466
Did you find
that fucking silver gun?

511
00:32:25,466 --> 00:32:27,578
I--I--I don't know.

512
00:32:38,945 --> 00:32:41,695
You want to study
for your G.E.D.? Here.

513
00:32:51,233 --> 00:32:54,713
Look what you done
to my fucking ride, bitch.

514
00:32:54,713 --> 00:32:56,924
It's just 6 weeks, baby.

515
00:32:56,924 --> 00:32:58,520
Please?

516
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,310
I only been taking 1 class--

517
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,871
1 class, 2 hours a week.

518
00:33:02,871 --> 00:33:05,695
I still got time
to be pulling tricks.

519
00:33:05,695 --> 00:33:08,249
3 fucking Gs I find you
for these fucking airbags...

520
00:33:08,249 --> 00:33:11,583
and what do I get in return?
Fucking night school?

521
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:13,372
I will quit.

522
00:33:13,372 --> 00:33:15,928
I am super-proud of you
for showing some initiative.

523
00:33:15,928 --> 00:33:18,171
Maybe I will even come
to your graduation.

524
00:33:18,171 --> 00:33:21,241
But first you're going to give me
back my fucking property!

525
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,828
You learn how to use that
watching Sesame Street?

526
00:33:35,007 --> 00:33:37,178
You ain't even holding it right.

527
00:33:38,911 --> 00:33:42,456
What's the matter, kid?
You got the shakes?

528
00:33:47,263 --> 00:33:50,808
Now I am going to put a smile
on your face, boy--

529
00:33:50,808 --> 00:33:52,756
cheek to cheek.

530
00:33:52,756 --> 00:33:55,319
You're going to be the happiest
little brat in school.

531
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:56,886
Say cheese.

532
00:33:58,431 --> 00:34:03,319
Who's laughing now, you fucking
gray meat limp dick motherfucker?

533
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:04,602
Mack daddy!

534
00:34:04,602 --> 00:34:06,493
Who's macking now, bitch?

535
00:34:06,493 --> 00:34:07,736
Puñeta!

536
00:34:10,814 --> 00:34:12,724
You got some cojones, kid.

537
00:34:28,509 --> 00:34:29,719
Let me see your fingers, son.

538
00:34:34,462 --> 00:34:36,698
Is this--
Hey, hey. Is this your son?

539
00:34:36,698 --> 00:34:39,100
I am taking care of him
tonight, OK?

540
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,955
Well, unless you have the name
and number of his doctor...

541
00:34:40,955 --> 00:34:42,581
and I can get a prescription
over the phone...

542
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,246
you're going to have
to take him to emergency, OK?

543
00:34:44,246 --> 00:34:45,397
Now, if you want me
to call you a cab--

544
00:34:45,397 --> 00:34:49,211
I don't need no fucking cab.
I need some spray shit for him.

545
00:34:49,211 --> 00:34:51,383
Well, that spray shit happens to be
a controlled substance, ma'am...

546
00:34:51,383 --> 00:34:52,850
so what can I tell you?

547
00:34:54,428 --> 00:34:55,606
Keep the change.

548
00:34:55,606 --> 00:34:57,684
I can't--This is stupid.
I can't do this.

549
00:34:57,684 --> 00:34:59,579
Listen, why don't we
go out in the back...

550
00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:01,467
and we talk about it, OK?

551
00:35:01,467 --> 00:35:03,572
- Look, lady--
- I will take care of you.

552
00:35:05,116 --> 00:35:06,840
There's nothing I can do, lady.

553
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,153
There's nothing you can do?

554
00:35:08,153 --> 00:35:09,300
Take him to emergency.

555
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,369
OK.

556
00:35:10,812 --> 00:35:12,088
OK.

557
00:35:12,088 --> 00:35:14,513
Nothing you can fucking do?

558
00:35:14,513 --> 00:35:17,403
Get what he needs...now.

559
00:35:17,403 --> 00:35:20,086
- It's Beclovent.
- Yeah, I know.

560
00:35:20,086 --> 00:35:21,465
Beclovent, bitch!

561
00:35:21,465 --> 00:35:23,387
Come on, let's just go back.

562
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:26,802
No. No. If he turns up,
your mom's going to call.

563
00:35:29,732 --> 00:35:30,232
T.

564
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,349
Sal.

565
00:35:35,387 --> 00:35:36,626
Yeah.

566
00:35:41,562 --> 00:35:43,537
Do girls really
get naked in there?

567
00:35:43,537 --> 00:35:45,619
You will find out when you're 21.

568
00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:48,375
I have seen Mom naked.
It's no big deal.

569
00:35:49,754 --> 00:35:51,893
Trust me on this one.
It's always a big deal.

570
00:35:53,371 --> 00:35:55,640
Stay here.

571
00:36:06,042 --> 00:36:08,311
Put your hands together
for the sexy redhead...

572
00:36:08,311 --> 00:36:09,151
Galaxy.

573
00:36:28,473 --> 00:36:30,481
What?

574
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:32,528
It's taken care of.

575
00:36:32,969 --> 00:36:36,366
It's taken care of.
Lucky us.

576
00:36:37,337 --> 00:36:38,766
Guys, sit down. Have a seat.

577
00:36:38,766 --> 00:36:40,215
Don't be shy.

578
00:36:42,073 --> 00:36:44,145
They make a good mai tai
for a twat bar...

579
00:36:44,145 --> 00:36:46,040
but seriously overpriced--

580
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,113
$2 million
for a round of drinks...

581
00:36:48,113 --> 00:36:49,363
and the pussy
ain't even that hot.

582
00:36:49,363 --> 00:36:51,026
Hey, baby.

583
00:36:51,026 --> 00:36:53,432
Jodi, I am doing business here.
Jodi...

584
00:36:53,432 --> 00:36:55,635
come on.
Get the fuck out of here.

585
00:36:55,635 --> 00:36:57,233
$2 million.

586
00:36:57,233 --> 00:37:00,054
Suck a dick, you prick bastard.
You don't have shit on us.

587
00:37:00,054 --> 00:37:01,397
What do you think of this?

588
00:37:01,397 --> 00:37:03,407
The cops never found these
at the scene...

589
00:37:03,407 --> 00:37:05,717
just 2 dead narcs
and 3 dead Jamaicans.

590
00:37:05,717 --> 00:37:07,126
Ballistics is going to reveal...

591
00:37:07,126 --> 00:37:08,589
that the slugs
that killed my partners...

592
00:37:08,589 --> 00:37:12,243
didn't come from the Jamaicans,
so there were others involved.

593
00:37:12,243 --> 00:37:13,967
As for myself...

594
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,607
I was never there.

595
00:37:15,607 --> 00:37:19,698
Well, dead guys tell no tales.

596
00:37:19,698 --> 00:37:23,248
Yeah. Why don't you ask
your pal here?

597
00:37:24,695 --> 00:37:26,670
What the fuck you talking about?

598
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,085
You blew my partner
Stevie's balls off...

599
00:37:28,085 --> 00:37:31,315
with a .38 snub nose,
a real distinctive piece--

600
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:35,029
stainless, polished up
like a spic's hubcap.

601
00:37:35,029 --> 00:37:38,446
Now, let me take
a wild guess here.

602
00:37:38,446 --> 00:37:41,618
I think that you gave him
the gun to dump in the river.

603
00:37:41,618 --> 00:37:43,149
Now, I am assuming that
he never got around to it...

604
00:37:43,149 --> 00:37:44,717
because 2 hours ago...

605
00:37:44,717 --> 00:37:47,279
his next-door neighbor
took a slug in the shoulder.

606
00:37:47,279 --> 00:37:49,489
The shooter was the guy's
10-year-old stepson...

607
00:37:49,489 --> 00:37:52,788
who was over at Gazelle's house
2 hours earlier.

608
00:37:52,788 --> 00:37:54,514
What the fuck
you trying to do here?

609
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,339
You trying to fucking play us?

610
00:37:56,339 --> 00:37:57,748
Because you're wasting
our fucking time.

611
00:37:57,748 --> 00:37:58,992
This is goddamn
fucking bullshit.

612
00:37:58,992 --> 00:38:01,067
Bullshit? Bullshit?

613
00:38:01,303 --> 00:38:03,342
This punk Anzor Yugorsky...

614
00:38:03,342 --> 00:38:06,066
he describes the gun to me
in vivid detail.

615
00:38:06,066 --> 00:38:10,575
Makes mention it's a snub nose
with a serious shine to it.

616
00:38:10,575 --> 00:38:12,523
What the fuck is this guy
talking about, Joey?

617
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:14,835
He's talking about a fucking shiny gun.
Big fucking deal.

618
00:38:14,835 --> 00:38:16,047
There's a thousand of them
on the street.

619
00:38:16,047 --> 00:38:17,460
It ain't the fucking piece.

620
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,112
Yeah? What were you doing
at the hospital...

621
00:38:20,112 --> 00:38:21,426
when they brought Yugorsky in?

622
00:38:22,062 --> 00:38:23,883
Sniffing around emergency?

623
00:38:24,226 --> 00:38:25,486
You know what I figure?

624
00:38:25,486 --> 00:38:26,899
I figure you were there
to pull a switch...

625
00:38:26,899 --> 00:38:28,559
on the slug
they took out of him.

626
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:31,892
My wife asked me to go
to the hospital.

627
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:33,169
She was concerned--you know,
in a neighborly way.

628
00:38:33,169 --> 00:38:34,153
She wanted me to go to see--

629
00:38:34,153 --> 00:38:36,140
All right, you know what?
Enough bullshit.

630
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,123
I expect to find a bag
in this locker...

631
00:38:38,123 --> 00:38:40,172
at Dominic Station by midnight.

632
00:38:40,172 --> 00:38:42,286
If the bag is not there
one minute after...

633
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:45,489
I am taking you all down
any fucking way I can...

634
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,466
even if I have to
manufacture the case.

635
00:38:47,466 --> 00:38:50,924
And you know I will, because I got
the toughest mob in the world.

636
00:38:50,924 --> 00:38:52,852
I am the law.

637
00:39:09,332 --> 00:39:11,787
All right, stay put.
I am going to grab you a burger.

638
00:39:11,787 --> 00:39:12,973
I am not hungry.

639
00:39:12,973 --> 00:39:15,630
Yeah, but you didn't finish dinner,
so I am going to grab you something to eat.

640
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,839
Stay here.

641
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:19,053
Dad?

642
00:39:20,851 --> 00:39:23,786
Don't go in there.
Let's just go home.

643
00:39:23,786 --> 00:39:25,649
It's going to be all right.

644
00:39:28,627 --> 00:39:29,969
No, it's not.

645
00:39:31,444 --> 00:39:33,266
Hey, Frankie, how you doing?

646
00:39:33,266 --> 00:39:35,568
- Hey, how are you?
- Yeah, it's good to see you.

647
00:39:35,568 --> 00:39:36,945
Sit, Joe.

648
00:39:36,945 --> 00:39:37,961
How you doing, guys?

649
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:40,207
- Hi, Joey.
- How you doing, man?

650
00:39:40,207 --> 00:39:41,835
- Joey.
- I am fine.

651
00:39:41,835 --> 00:39:43,216
You want some coffee,
something to eat?

652
00:39:43,216 --> 00:39:44,658
Nah, I am good. But, listen...

653
00:39:44,658 --> 00:39:46,283
I got my boy,
he's waiting out in the car.

654
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:47,435
I want to get him a burger
or something.

655
00:39:47,435 --> 00:39:48,816
Tony, go and take care
of that, yeah?

656
00:39:48,816 --> 00:39:52,047
Yeah, Tony, get him some fries
and a strawberry shake.

657
00:39:52,047 --> 00:39:54,187
And don't scare him.
He don't know you're coming.

658
00:39:58,034 --> 00:39:59,408
So, Joe...

659
00:39:59,408 --> 00:40:01,035
I just got off the phone
with Ivan Yugorsky...

660
00:40:01,035 --> 00:40:02,318
about this thing
with his nephew.

661
00:40:02,318 --> 00:40:04,842
I told you.
It's not the fucking piece.

662
00:40:04,842 --> 00:40:09,355
Look, everybody knows the nephew
is a brain-fried retrobate.

663
00:40:09,355 --> 00:40:11,303
Yeah, whatever.
He's a fucking tweaker piece of shit.

664
00:40:11,303 --> 00:40:13,353
And he's cooking meth
in his backyard.

665
00:40:13,353 --> 00:40:15,248
I know I told you this already,
but it's just a matter of time...

666
00:40:15,248 --> 00:40:16,526
before he blows up the whole
fucking neighborhood.

667
00:40:16,526 --> 00:40:20,075
We notice, but it's a sensitive issue
with me and you.

668
00:40:20,075 --> 00:40:23,758
Now, I am in bed with Yugorsky
on this gasoline deal.

669
00:40:23,758 --> 00:40:27,109
Hey, it's a good deal.
I don't want to rock the boat.

670
00:40:27,109 --> 00:40:29,670
Fuck that.
Fuck those Russian cunts!

671
00:40:30,513 --> 00:40:34,407
Pa, it's the fucking narc
that's got his dick in our ass.

672
00:40:34,407 --> 00:40:35,127
Hey...

673
00:40:36,561 --> 00:40:38,983
calm down, Tommy.

674
00:40:38,983 --> 00:40:42,887
You see, Joe, the tweaker's
got it in his head...

675
00:40:42,887 --> 00:40:44,489
that maybe you were looking...

676
00:40:44,489 --> 00:40:46,089
to knock him out
of the cooking business...

677
00:40:46,089 --> 00:40:49,609
and help the boy out.
Made a piece available to him.

678
00:40:50,736 --> 00:40:53,802
I would never use a kid
to do something like that.

679
00:40:53,802 --> 00:40:55,466
Never.

680
00:40:55,466 --> 00:40:58,221
All right, all right, look.

681
00:40:58,221 --> 00:41:00,874
I made a personal reassurance
to Yugorsky...

682
00:41:00,874 --> 00:41:02,887
that I would have
my entire crew in the street...

683
00:41:02,887 --> 00:41:04,554
out looking for that kid.

684
00:41:04,554 --> 00:41:08,269
Now, in the interest
of professional harmony...

685
00:41:08,269 --> 00:41:10,508
I think we all want
to get our stories straight.

686
00:41:10,508 --> 00:41:12,845
You agree, don't you, Joe?

687
00:41:17,648 --> 00:41:19,470
One hamburger,
and you're out of my life.

688
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,518
That's it.

689
00:41:20,518 --> 00:41:21,804
Oleg.

690
00:41:26,544 --> 00:41:28,038
Shit.

691
00:41:28,038 --> 00:41:29,606
Hey, kid...

692
00:41:29,606 --> 00:41:30,858
how you doing?

693
00:41:30,858 --> 00:41:32,683
Your old man sent this stuff
out for you.

694
00:41:32,683 --> 00:41:34,344
Thanks.

695
00:41:34,344 --> 00:41:35,844
Ain't it a little late
for you to be out?

696
00:41:35,844 --> 00:41:38,026
I got twins your age.
They're in bed by now.

697
00:41:38,026 --> 00:41:40,485
What are you, like, 9?

698
00:41:40,485 --> 00:41:42,054
10...

699
00:41:42,054 --> 00:41:43,524
and a half.

700
00:41:43,524 --> 00:41:45,356
I got to go to the bathroom.

701
00:41:54,383 --> 00:41:56,804
Hey, Joey...

702
00:41:56,804 --> 00:41:59,083
looks like your kid
don't listen too well.

703
00:42:01,422 --> 00:42:04,040
It must run in the family.

704
00:42:06,126 --> 00:42:07,752
Hey, Nicky, get over here.

705
00:42:07,752 --> 00:42:09,481
Get over here.

706
00:42:13,454 --> 00:42:15,941
What the hell you doing?
I thought I told you to wait in the car.

707
00:42:15,941 --> 00:42:17,192
I had to go to the bathroom.

708
00:42:17,192 --> 00:42:21,004
How you doing, Nicky? You want
you want some gummy bears?

709
00:42:21,004 --> 00:42:24,812
Hey, Nicky,
you wouldn't by chance...

710
00:42:24,812 --> 00:42:28,490
know where your friend
got that gun, would you?

711
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:29,742
No.

712
00:42:30,446 --> 00:42:32,234
I have to go to the bathroom.

713
00:42:32,234 --> 00:42:33,415
OK.

714
00:42:33,415 --> 00:42:35,395
Nicky, you go to the bathroom.

715
00:42:40,941 --> 00:42:42,850
Have you decided yet?

716
00:42:43,885 --> 00:42:45,194
I have a bus to catch in--

717
00:42:45,194 --> 00:42:46,603
Cuando?

718
00:42:46,603 --> 00:42:47,978
I will have a cheeseburger
and a coke.

719
00:42:49,101 --> 00:42:51,687
I got to go to the bathroom.

720
00:42:51,687 --> 00:42:53,416
Don't worry. We're going to
take care of the cop, OK?

721
00:42:53,416 --> 00:42:55,078
- I know.
- OK.

722
00:43:03,853 --> 00:43:05,030
Where is it?

723
00:43:19,436 --> 00:43:20,864
Hey, Nicky.

724
00:43:22,188 --> 00:43:24,522
- Where the hell are you?
- I am almost done.

725
00:43:24,522 --> 00:43:25,930
Well, hurry up in there.
Come on, we got to go.

726
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:27,524
- Razors.
- Razors.

727
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:32,936
Get over there
and wash your hands.

728
00:43:32,936 --> 00:43:34,433
We got to get out of here.
Come on.

729
00:43:45,451 --> 00:43:46,701
Fuck.

730
00:43:50,891 --> 00:43:52,484
Hey, sweetie, how you doing?

731
00:43:52,484 --> 00:43:53,504
Good, hon.

732
00:43:53,504 --> 00:43:56,895
All right, Nick, listen to me.
I want you to think really hard...

733
00:43:56,895 --> 00:43:58,182
about where your friend
might be right now...

734
00:43:58,182 --> 00:43:59,626
because the others,
they're looking for him...

735
00:43:59,626 --> 00:44:01,000
and if they
find him first, I am--

736
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,271
- They won't find the gun.
- What did you say?

737
00:44:03,271 --> 00:44:05,216
What did you say?

738
00:44:09,898 --> 00:44:11,043
Don't you mess with me, Nicky.

739
00:44:11,043 --> 00:44:12,871
I want you
to fucking talk to me now.

740
00:44:12,871 --> 00:44:14,793
Just promise me
you won't hurt him.

741
00:44:14,793 --> 00:44:16,255
Nick, I don't have time
for this shit right now.

742
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:17,858
- Now fucking tell me.
- Promise!

743
00:44:17,858 --> 00:44:20,897
Promise you what? What, what?
I promise. I swear to God.

744
00:44:20,897 --> 00:44:22,182
I am not going to fucking
hurt your friend.

745
00:44:22,182 --> 00:44:25,284
Now, just come on. Just tell me.
Just tell me what you know.

746
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:45,474
Come on.

747
00:44:52,392 --> 00:44:54,148
This one here?

748
00:45:01,544 --> 00:45:02,754
Man.

749
00:45:33,575 --> 00:45:35,004
Come on, where is it, Nick?

750
00:45:35,004 --> 00:45:36,291
I thought you said
you put it in there.

751
00:45:36,291 --> 00:45:37,636
Well, I did.
I put it right there.

752
00:45:37,636 --> 00:45:39,613
Then where is it? I thought
you said you put it in the tank.

753
00:45:39,613 --> 00:45:40,702
I put it in here.

754
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:45,021
Shit. Which one
did you put it in, Nick?

755
00:45:45,663 --> 00:45:47,510
Which one did you put it in?

756
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:54,685
God damn it, Nicky.

757
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:57,148
Why'd you lie to me?
Why did you lie to me?

758
00:45:57,148 --> 00:45:58,336
I didn't.

759
00:45:58,336 --> 00:46:01,309
Why did you lie to me?!
Why did you lie to me?!

760
00:46:01,309 --> 00:46:03,259
I am not fucking lying!
I put it in there!

761
00:46:03,259 --> 00:46:06,531
You just fucking
killed me, Nick.

762
00:46:06,531 --> 00:46:08,508
You just fucking killed me.

763
00:46:49,413 --> 00:46:51,551
You come here.

764
00:46:51,551 --> 00:46:53,312
Now, I want you to keep
an eye open, right?

765
00:46:53,312 --> 00:46:54,461
If you see anybody come...

766
00:46:54,461 --> 00:46:56,355
I want you to cough really loud,
all right?

767
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,790
You're like a broken record.

768
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:11,388
I am telling you.
You got to see this.

769
00:47:11,388 --> 00:47:13,118
You better not be
jerking my chain.

770
00:47:13,118 --> 00:47:14,879
What are you doing here, kid?

771
00:47:14,879 --> 00:47:16,606
I was looking for the bathroom.

772
00:47:16,606 --> 00:47:18,683
See? Even the kid thinks
it's a shithole back here.

773
00:47:18,683 --> 00:47:20,131
Shut up, Ralphie.

774
00:47:20,131 --> 00:47:21,374
All right, just...

775
00:47:21,374 --> 00:47:23,005
you go on out
through that door there...

776
00:47:23,005 --> 00:47:24,670
turn left, go all the way
down to the end...

777
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:26,813
turn left again,
and you're there.

778
00:47:26,813 --> 00:47:28,477
You got it?

779
00:47:33,587 --> 00:47:34,864
Which door?

780
00:47:36,579 --> 00:47:39,613
Come here, kid. I will show you.
Come here, kid.

781
00:47:40,579 --> 00:47:41,953
Hey, Yolanda.

782
00:47:41,953 --> 00:47:43,231
- Come on.
- Wait up.

783
00:47:43,231 --> 00:47:44,412
Where you going
with my cheesecake?

784
00:47:44,412 --> 00:47:47,550
No, this is for
paying customers, not you.

785
00:47:50,615 --> 00:47:51,838
Manny.

786
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:53,468
Where are you? Here.

787
00:47:55,459 --> 00:47:58,109
There. I got your number, fucker.

788
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:11,447
Forget it. I ain't dragging
your butt across no state lines.

789
00:48:13,806 --> 00:48:16,189
Look, papa,
why don't you just go home?

790
00:48:16,189 --> 00:48:18,909
I bet you things are not as bad
as you think they are.

791
00:48:26,305 --> 00:48:27,865
Come on, papa.

792
00:48:31,146 --> 00:48:32,953
Motherfucker!

793
00:48:32,953 --> 00:48:34,335
Be careful what you say!

794
00:48:34,335 --> 00:48:36,442
Get down! Over here.

795
00:48:36,442 --> 00:48:39,864
Run! Run, little man, run!

796
00:48:42,976 --> 00:48:44,220
Hey!

797
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:45,533
Let go!

798
00:48:45,533 --> 00:48:47,608
Get off! Get off!

799
00:48:47,608 --> 00:48:48,859
Get off!

800
00:49:09,728 --> 00:49:12,346
Do you know these guys?

801
00:49:21,087 --> 00:49:22,069
Yeah.

802
00:49:22,069 --> 00:49:23,291
Baby?

803
00:49:24,288 --> 00:49:25,532
Where the hell are you?

804
00:49:25,532 --> 00:49:27,226
Taking care of things.

805
00:49:27,226 --> 00:49:28,507
Well, forget about it...

806
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,965
because they picked up Oleg at
a bus station with some hooker.

807
00:49:30,965 --> 00:49:34,073
Who picked him up? The cops?

808
00:49:34,073 --> 00:49:35,093
Yeah.

809
00:49:35,093 --> 00:49:37,371
Jesus Christ.
This is fucking bullshit.

810
00:49:37,371 --> 00:49:38,781
- Hey...
- Fuck!

811
00:49:38,781 --> 00:49:40,724
Hey! You got Nicky with you?

812
00:49:40,724 --> 00:49:42,109
Yeah, he's right here.

813
00:49:42,109 --> 00:49:43,997
Then stop using your mouth
around him...

814
00:49:43,997 --> 00:49:46,965
and bring my son home now.

815
00:49:46,965 --> 00:49:48,468
Yeah.

816
00:49:48,468 --> 00:49:50,452
Yeah, that's what I am doing.
I am bringing him home right now.

817
00:50:01,023 --> 00:50:02,168
Do you mind?

818
00:50:02,168 --> 00:50:04,181
I am feeling kind of parched.

819
00:50:05,854 --> 00:50:07,741
Big game Friday night.

820
00:50:07,741 --> 00:50:09,810
I bet you're excited about that.

821
00:50:10,046 --> 00:50:11,573
It's going to be red ice...

822
00:50:11,573 --> 00:50:13,469
and plenty of
blue shirt body bags.

823
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:14,949
Am I right?

824
00:50:16,382 --> 00:50:18,454
Look...

825
00:50:18,454 --> 00:50:20,217
I could help you, kid--

826
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:21,977
you and your mom, if need be.

827
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:25,974
Now, I could get that prick
out of your life, lock him up.

828
00:50:25,974 --> 00:50:28,501
I could do that. I am a cop.

829
00:50:28,501 --> 00:50:31,858
All you have to do is tell me
where you found the gun...

830
00:50:31,858 --> 00:50:35,131
and where you stashed it.

831
00:50:35,131 --> 00:50:37,434
That's it. What do you say?

832
00:50:38,589 --> 00:50:40,182
You let me help you.

833
00:50:43,805 --> 00:50:45,943
Get out of here, Mila.

834
00:50:45,943 --> 00:50:48,566
You know, go to a shelter.

835
00:50:48,566 --> 00:50:51,452
I mean,
I can get you an address.

836
00:50:51,452 --> 00:50:53,623
You don't understand.

837
00:50:55,356 --> 00:50:57,745
I belong to him.

838
00:50:57,745 --> 00:50:58,825
No. No...

839
00:51:01,108 --> 00:51:03,205
I don't understand.

840
00:51:06,204 --> 00:51:09,139
I was prostitute in Moscow.

841
00:51:11,771 --> 00:51:15,067
Yugorsky Escort Service
offered to bring girls over...

842
00:51:15,067 --> 00:51:18,712
with promise of big bucks.

843
00:51:18,712 --> 00:51:21,169
We would owe $50,000--

844
00:51:21,169 --> 00:51:23,383
you know, pay back through work.

845
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,387
I take offer...

846
00:51:27,387 --> 00:51:30,616
not tell them I am pregnant.

847
00:51:30,616 --> 00:51:32,986
When they find out...

848
00:51:35,323 --> 00:51:37,395
they insist I have an abortion.

849
00:51:37,736 --> 00:51:39,378
I told them no.

850
00:51:41,787 --> 00:51:44,503
They sent Anzor to kill me.

851
00:51:46,075 --> 00:51:47,864
Anzor's not a killer.

852
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:51,281
He's not hard man...

853
00:51:51,281 --> 00:51:53,625
like big Yugorsky.

854
00:51:55,578 --> 00:51:57,945
He thinks...

855
00:51:59,259 --> 00:52:01,560
he thinks he's,
you know, John Wayne.

856
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:06,585
Must do right thing.

857
00:52:07,642 --> 00:52:09,617
He goes against his uncle.

858
00:52:09,617 --> 00:52:13,782
He tells big man Yugorsky
he will pay off my debt.

859
00:52:14,906 --> 00:52:17,589
His uncle refuses...

860
00:52:17,589 --> 00:52:20,015
tells him...

861
00:52:20,015 --> 00:52:24,814
he will send others to kill me
to set example.

862
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:29,806
So, Anzor make me wife.

863
00:52:29,806 --> 00:52:33,461
Big man Yugorsky
can't kill his nephew's wife.

864
00:52:36,346 --> 00:52:41,331
But he tells Anzor
to leave Little Odessa.

865
00:52:41,331 --> 00:52:43,201
He's no longer...

866
00:52:44,009 --> 00:52:46,381
working for Yugorsky family.

867
00:52:47,416 --> 00:52:48,977
Yeah.

868
00:52:50,904 --> 00:52:53,108
I am going to get you
the name of a shelter.

869
00:53:03,736 --> 00:53:05,296
You OK?

870
00:53:06,584 --> 00:53:07,991
This ain't right, Joe.

871
00:53:07,991 --> 00:53:10,577
He don't need to be
put through this.

872
00:53:10,577 --> 00:53:12,820
Nick, I am proud of you.
You done good, all right?

873
00:53:22,008 --> 00:53:24,397
Look, I am going to head up
to Community Hills.

874
00:53:24,397 --> 00:53:25,716
The cops don't got
the gun yet...

875
00:53:25,716 --> 00:53:28,599
but I may have a line on it,
so I am going to go over there.

876
00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:30,420
I am scared, Joe.

877
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:34,001
I am pissed at you,
and I am scared--

878
00:53:34,001 --> 00:53:36,014
equal measures.

879
00:53:42,423 --> 00:53:44,016
Be careful.

880
00:53:54,487 --> 00:53:55,730
- Hey.
- Hey.

881
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:58,068
Just got word.
The cops picked up the kid.

882
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,793
Anything you still
want to tell us?

883
00:53:59,793 --> 00:54:01,521
Tell you what?
There's nothing to tell.

884
00:54:01,521 --> 00:54:03,282
Where you headed, Joe?

885
00:54:04,618 --> 00:54:07,307
I was supposed to head to the store
and pick up some milk and eggs.

886
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:10,000
In all the excitement,
I forgot to do it, so...

887
00:54:12,538 --> 00:54:15,373
Yugorsky's going to call us
when he talks to the kid.

888
00:54:16,534 --> 00:54:18,422
Don't go too far.

889
00:54:20,022 --> 00:54:21,102
Later, Joe.

890
00:54:21,102 --> 00:54:22,897
Yeah, see you.

891
00:54:24,341 --> 00:54:25,770
Hey, T...

892
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:27,439
looking fucking good.

893
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:36,945
He keeps giving me
this bullshit story...

894
00:54:36,945 --> 00:54:40,461
about finding the gun in some
abandoned locker in school.

895
00:54:40,461 --> 00:54:43,250
What do you want me to do?
The little fucker shot me.

896
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:44,692
He ain't going to
spill dick to you.

897
00:54:44,692 --> 00:54:47,954
You know, I don't think
I am being clear enough here.

898
00:54:47,954 --> 00:54:49,777
You know what I mean?

899
00:54:51,156 --> 00:54:54,222
Let me be crystal clear.

900
00:54:54,222 --> 00:54:56,562
You get the boy
to give up Gazelle...

901
00:54:56,562 --> 00:54:58,768
or I am closing shop
on your tweaker ass...

902
00:54:58,768 --> 00:55:00,659
and I am taking you down
fucking hard.

903
00:55:00,659 --> 00:55:02,100
Understand me?

904
00:55:08,196 --> 00:55:10,465
Hey, cowboy.

905
00:55:10,465 --> 00:55:12,387
Want to go get some ice cream?

906
00:55:27,395 --> 00:55:30,330
Yo, we got good shit, daddy.

907
00:55:33,795 --> 00:55:37,111
Get the fuck away from my car.

908
00:55:43,171 --> 00:55:44,894
Hey. Hey,
I am looking for Manny Perez.

909
00:55:44,894 --> 00:55:46,491
He--he's not here. No!

910
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:50,782
Manny? Where the fuck is he?

911
00:55:50,782 --> 00:55:52,095
- He's not here.
- Where is he?

912
00:55:52,095 --> 00:55:53,145
Where is he?!

913
00:55:53,145 --> 00:55:54,298
He's not here!

914
00:55:54,298 --> 00:55:55,767
You better not
fucking lie to me!

915
00:55:56,802 --> 00:55:58,144
Where the fuck is he?
Where is he?

916
00:55:58,144 --> 00:55:59,519
- OK, OK.
- Where is he?

917
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:01,048
He's at Armando's.

918
00:56:01,048 --> 00:56:02,137
Armando's.

919
00:56:02,137 --> 00:56:04,283
- He's at Armando's.
- Yes. He's at--

920
00:56:04,283 --> 00:56:05,915
Get the hell out of the way.
You stay right there.

921
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:12,897
What's your name?
What's your name?

922
00:56:12,897 --> 00:56:15,007
Conchita.

923
00:56:15,007 --> 00:56:18,241
Now, you listen to me, Conchita.
You listen to me real good.

924
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:19,964
- I don't want to hurt Manny.
- OK.

925
00:56:19,964 --> 00:56:21,376
All right?
I don't want to hurt him...

926
00:56:21,376 --> 00:56:23,198
but he has something
that belongs to me--a gun.

927
00:56:23,198 --> 00:56:24,411
Do you know anything
about a gun?

928
00:56:24,411 --> 00:56:25,398
- No, no.
- No.

929
00:56:25,398 --> 00:56:28,343
No. It's block 5, number 602.
That's where he is.

930
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:30,360
OK. Now, listen to me.

931
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,289
We are now on what we call
the honor system.

932
00:56:32,289 --> 00:56:33,499
You comprende?
You understand what I am saying?

933
00:56:33,499 --> 00:56:34,519
- Sí.
- OK.

934
00:56:34,519 --> 00:56:36,284
- You don't call Manny.
- OK.

935
00:56:36,284 --> 00:56:39,071
You don't tell Manny I am coming.
You don't warn him for anything...

936
00:56:39,071 --> 00:56:40,631
because if you do,
I am going to come back here!

937
00:56:49,393 --> 00:56:51,694
I can be an asshole.

938
00:56:53,552 --> 00:56:55,690
You have made your point.

939
00:56:57,104 --> 00:56:59,209
You showed some balls.

940
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,927
I like that.

941
00:57:06,832 --> 00:57:09,287
But now it's time to be smart.

942
00:57:11,087 --> 00:57:15,397
You tell me
what I want to know...

943
00:57:15,397 --> 00:57:17,097
and I am going to reward you--

944
00:57:17,097 --> 00:57:19,853
Razors season tickets.

945
00:57:23,247 --> 00:57:24,557
I am sorry.

946
00:57:24,557 --> 00:57:26,500
It's OK.

947
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,844
I told you, we're cool.

948
00:57:28,844 --> 00:57:30,286
Just tell me.

949
00:57:30,286 --> 00:57:31,912
I am sorry I missed.

950
00:57:33,391 --> 00:57:35,333
You little shit.

951
00:57:38,543 --> 00:57:41,609
Tell me where
the fucking gun is.

952
00:57:41,609 --> 00:57:44,232
You tell me,
or I will fucking kill you.

953
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:47,100
Fuck!

954
00:57:49,806 --> 00:57:51,661
Oleg!

955
00:57:58,734 --> 00:57:59,846
Oleg!

956
00:58:01,998 --> 00:58:03,525
Oleg!

957
00:58:08,845 --> 00:58:10,252
Where are you?

958
00:58:10,252 --> 00:58:11,846
You little shit!

959
00:58:16,013 --> 00:58:18,184
Oleg!

960
00:58:18,184 --> 00:58:20,131
I will find you!

961
00:58:26,605 --> 00:58:28,744
I am going to kill you, you...

962
00:58:28,744 --> 00:58:32,327
You're only making it
worse on yourself!

963
00:58:32,327 --> 00:58:34,405
Do you hear me?

964
00:58:42,413 --> 00:58:45,282
Jeez, Edele,
I think we picked up a stray.

965
00:58:46,765 --> 00:58:48,619
Indeed.

966
00:58:48,619 --> 00:58:50,375
Hello there.

967
00:58:50,375 --> 00:58:51,459
Hi.

968
00:58:51,459 --> 00:58:54,729
And who might you be?

969
00:58:54,729 --> 00:58:56,105
You know, I think we should get
another ice cream cone.

970
00:58:56,105 --> 00:58:58,758
I think you're right, Papa Bear.

971
00:59:09,515 --> 00:59:10,693
Hey.

972
00:59:10,693 --> 00:59:12,389
Hey, are you Manny?

973
00:59:12,389 --> 00:59:15,242
Manny? Nah. He's upstairs.
What you want with him?

974
00:59:15,775 --> 00:59:16,769
Business.

975
00:59:16,769 --> 00:59:19,113
If he owes you any money,
forget about it.

976
00:59:19,548 --> 00:59:21,002
I just cleaned the cabron out.

977
00:59:22,923 --> 00:59:24,297
Yeah? Who is it?

978
00:59:24,297 --> 00:59:26,054
It's Conchita.

979
00:59:26,666 --> 00:59:28,644
- Conchita.
- La Conchita.

980
00:59:32,394 --> 00:59:33,955
Faces on the fucking table!

981
00:59:33,955 --> 00:59:35,456
Heads down and fucking hands
behind your head!

982
00:59:35,456 --> 00:59:37,441
You move,
and I will fuck you up!

983
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:39,654
I will fuck you up!
Don't you move, partner.

984
00:59:39,654 --> 00:59:41,119
Don't you fucking move.

985
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:42,406
I will fuck you up.

986
00:59:42,406 --> 00:59:43,752
Which one of you is fucking Manny?

987
00:59:43,752 --> 00:59:44,801
Who's Manny?

988
00:59:46,698 --> 00:59:48,040
Are you done?

989
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:49,252
- You mother--
- Pendejo!

990
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,592
You Manny? You motherfucker!

991
00:59:51,592 --> 00:59:53,601
Don't call me pendejo,
you fuck!

992
00:59:53,601 --> 00:59:56,544
I want my fucking gun!
I want my fucking snub nose!

993
00:59:56,544 --> 00:59:58,277
You lifted it from
the fucking Arlington!

994
00:59:58,277 --> 01:00:00,735
Now, where the fuck is it?
Where the fuck is it?

995
01:00:05,066 --> 01:00:07,302
Fuck you!
Where the fuck is my gun?

996
01:00:21,865 --> 01:00:23,141
<i>* Stressed out,
but I am going to hold out</i>

997
01:00:23,141 --> 01:00:24,606
<i>* For the whole 9,
that's no doubt</i>

998
01:00:24,606 --> 01:00:26,307
<i>* Till I get what's mine
I am throwing no doubt...</i>

999
01:00:26,307 --> 01:00:27,557
Fuck!

1000
01:00:29,161 --> 01:00:31,397
Fuck! Motherfucker!

1001
01:00:34,185 --> 01:00:35,746
- Look at that.
- That's a good smile.

1002
01:00:35,746 --> 01:00:36,930
Look at those braces.

1003
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:39,838
- There's a little dimple there.
- They are.

1004
01:00:42,344 --> 01:00:44,548
Yeah, that's super cute.

1005
01:00:44,548 --> 01:00:45,846
Isn't this cool?

1006
01:00:46,088 --> 01:00:47,332
Here, come on.
Look back in the camera.

1007
01:00:47,332 --> 01:00:48,645
Try it again.
And you push that.

1008
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:49,891
Look in there and push--

1009
01:00:50,128 --> 01:00:51,270
My gosh. Yeah.

1010
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:53,028
You can't see, right?

1011
01:00:53,028 --> 01:00:54,722
- Hey, Eric.
- That's very smart. Yeah.

1012
01:00:54,722 --> 01:00:57,694
- You want to hug your sister?
- Yeah. Come on.

1013
01:00:57,694 --> 01:00:59,678
Just a little bit.
Get a little closer.

1014
01:00:59,678 --> 01:01:01,411
Come on,
you guys love each other.

1015
01:01:01,411 --> 01:01:03,750
- You need a little hug.
- A little closer.

1016
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:05,791
- Come on.
- Extend the arm.

1017
01:01:07,528 --> 01:01:09,470
Come on. Come on, Eric.

1018
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:10,689
You can do it
a little better than that.

1019
01:01:10,689 --> 01:01:12,582
I mean,
that's your sister, right?

1020
01:01:12,582 --> 01:01:13,663
That's very good.

1021
01:01:13,663 --> 01:01:15,776
You love your sister, don't you?

1022
01:01:15,776 --> 01:01:17,092
What about you, Oleg?

1023
01:01:17,092 --> 01:01:19,746
You want to be in the film
as well, don't you?

1024
01:01:19,746 --> 01:01:21,987
My stomach hurts.
Can I go to the bathroom?

1025
01:01:21,987 --> 01:01:23,365
Sure.

1026
01:01:25,383 --> 01:01:27,140
I will just hold on to this.

1027
01:01:27,655 --> 01:01:30,022
You go outside,
you take a right...

1028
01:01:30,022 --> 01:01:31,582
and then a left.

1029
01:01:31,582 --> 01:01:33,346
Hurry up though.
You're missing out.

1030
01:01:36,423 --> 01:01:38,332
Who wants to play dress-up?

1031
01:01:38,332 --> 01:01:39,749
Good, dress-up.

1032
01:01:39,749 --> 01:01:43,427
We have the Burning Rocket
and the Volts.

1033
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:53,406
There you are.

1034
01:02:53,406 --> 01:02:57,219
I thought you needed
to go to the bathroom.

1035
01:02:57,219 --> 01:02:58,779
I couldn't find it.

1036
01:03:00,036 --> 01:03:01,596
Silly boy.

1037
01:03:01,596 --> 01:03:05,280
I told you to take a right,
then a left.

1038
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:09,635
Come.

1039
01:03:10,067 --> 01:03:11,311
I will show you.

1040
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:19,042
Don't forget to wash your hands
when you're done.

1041
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:35,193
Joe?

1042
01:03:35,193 --> 01:03:36,677
<i>Mrs. Gazelle?</i>

1043
01:03:37,619 --> 01:03:38,680
Who is this?

1044
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,064
- Is this--
- Oleg.

1045
01:03:40,064 --> 01:03:42,139
I am sorry about taking the gun,
Mrs. Gazelle.

1046
01:03:42,779 --> 01:03:44,034
Oleg, where are you?

1047
01:03:44,034 --> 01:03:45,626
<i>I think I am in trouble.</i>

1048
01:03:45,626 --> 01:03:48,220
<i>Sweetheart,
I know what happened, OK?</i>

1049
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:49,502
I need you to be
straight up with me.

1050
01:03:49,502 --> 01:03:51,229
Are the police listening
in on this call?

1051
01:03:51,766 --> 01:03:53,339
<i>No, I am not with the police.</i>

1052
01:03:53,339 --> 01:03:57,437
I am at Dez and Edele's apartment.
There's 2 other kids here.

1053
01:03:57,674 --> 01:03:58,554
<i>What?</i>

1054
01:03:58,554 --> 01:04:00,831
I--I think they are
going to hurt us.

1055
01:04:01,066 --> 01:04:02,210
<i>Jesus.</i>

1056
01:04:02,210 --> 01:04:04,284
Come on. No.
Is this some kind of a joke?

1057
01:04:04,921 --> 01:04:06,796
<i>Oleg, you have caused
enough trouble today.</i>

1058
01:04:06,796 --> 01:04:07,615
Where are you?

1059
01:04:07,615 --> 01:04:10,203
<i>I don't know.
I was in the back of a van.</i>

1060
01:04:10,203 --> 01:04:11,354
They brought us here.

1061
01:04:11,354 --> 01:04:13,149
They got this room
with all these toys in it.

1062
01:04:13,149 --> 01:04:14,592
They're making a video.

1063
01:04:14,592 --> 01:04:17,113
OK, OK. Oleg,
I need you to look around...

1064
01:04:17,113 --> 01:04:19,128
for an address for me, OK?

1065
01:04:19,870 --> 01:04:21,144
Is there any mail
laying around?

1066
01:04:21,144 --> 01:04:23,836
I am in the bathroom.
She's going to come back any minute.

1067
01:04:23,836 --> 01:04:27,189
Bathroom. Jesus,
I don't know, I don't know.

1068
01:04:27,533 --> 01:04:28,722
I don't know.

1069
01:04:29,557 --> 01:04:32,616
<i>I don't know.
Just call 911.</i>

1070
01:04:33,153 --> 01:04:36,349
No. I don't want to go
back to the police.

1071
01:04:36,349 --> 01:04:37,643
<i>Why?</i>

1072
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:41,080
They want me to say
I got the gun from Mr. Gazelle.

1073
01:04:45,437 --> 01:04:47,154
<i>Do you need
some help in there?</i>

1074
01:04:47,488 --> 01:04:49,179
<i>I am OK.</i>

1075
01:04:49,179 --> 01:04:51,485
<i>It's my stomach.
I am almost done.</i>

1076
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,487
You poor thing.

1077
01:04:54,487 --> 01:04:56,950
Well, I am right outside.

1078
01:04:56,950 --> 01:04:58,399
- Oleg.
- I am still here.

1079
01:04:58,399 --> 01:04:59,675
OK.

1080
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:03,866
OK, so look
in the medicine cabinet.

1081
01:05:04,204 --> 01:05:05,464
Do you see any bottles?

1082
01:05:05,464 --> 01:05:09,333
Prescription bottles usually have
the address on the front label.

1083
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,629
<i>Do you see anything?</i>

1084
01:05:12,872 --> 01:05:14,559
<i>Is there anything in there?</i>

1085
01:05:17,535 --> 01:05:19,510
<i>Oleg, what--
what's happening?</i>

1086
01:05:23,551 --> 01:05:25,820
Oleg, it's Dez.
You want to open up, please?

1087
01:05:26,911 --> 01:05:28,188
Oleg.

1088
01:05:32,511 --> 01:05:34,234
OK. Oleg?

1089
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:36,947
- Come on.
- Oleg?

1090
01:05:36,947 --> 01:05:37,939
- Oleg.
- Oleg!

1091
01:05:37,939 --> 01:05:39,063
What is--
what's going on?

1092
01:05:39,063 --> 01:05:40,444
<i>Oleg!</i>

1093
01:05:40,444 --> 01:05:41,623
Just open the door.

1094
01:05:41,623 --> 01:05:43,550
Mrs. Gazelle, I got a bottle.

1095
01:05:43,550 --> 01:05:44,924
So, now read me the address.

1096
01:05:45,759 --> 01:05:48,123
1456 Owens Park Lane, Hoboken.

1097
01:05:48,558 --> 01:05:52,533
Oleg! Let's go! Open the door!

1098
01:05:52,533 --> 01:05:54,909
- Oleg?
- Come on! Oleg!

1099
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:55,629
Jesus!

1100
01:05:59,742 --> 01:06:01,433
Wake up, wake up.

1101
01:06:01,433 --> 01:06:03,925
We got to go get Oleg.
Come on, put your coat on.

1102
01:06:03,925 --> 01:06:05,143
I thought he was in jail.

1103
01:06:09,310 --> 01:06:11,699
Hey, homes.

1104
01:06:11,699 --> 01:06:13,432
I got a busted headlight.

1105
01:06:13,432 --> 01:06:15,379
Hey, Lester, my man.

1106
01:06:16,422 --> 01:06:17,811
Who got over on you, bro?

1107
01:06:17,811 --> 01:06:20,155
Some puta
who's forwarding address...

1108
01:06:20,155 --> 01:06:22,556
is going to be
in 10 different zip codes...

1109
01:06:22,789 --> 01:06:24,247
all of them dumpsters.

1110
01:06:27,837 --> 01:06:31,481
I got you covered
by tomorrow night.

1111
01:06:31,481 --> 01:06:34,550
Hey, check this out.
Is that sweet or what?

1112
01:06:34,550 --> 01:06:36,694
Hey, a royal flush
put her in my pocket.

1113
01:06:36,694 --> 01:06:38,489
300 cold puts her in mine.

1114
01:06:38,489 --> 01:06:40,434
No, man. She's a beauty.

1115
01:06:40,434 --> 01:06:42,549
Think I am going to hold on to her.

1116
01:06:44,061 --> 01:06:45,555
500.

1117
01:06:46,996 --> 01:06:48,051
I won't miss them--

1118
01:06:48,051 --> 01:06:49,783
not until Cinco de Mayo.

1119
01:07:02,204 --> 01:07:03,895
Oh, Joe. Shit!

1120
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:09,300
I am under a lot of stress tonight,
so whatever I say don't count.

1121
01:07:10,971 --> 01:07:13,076
Do I still have to go
to school tomorrow?

1122
01:07:14,267 --> 01:07:16,155
I don't know. We will see.

1123
01:07:32,347 --> 01:07:33,557
Remember me?

1124
01:07:33,557 --> 01:07:35,001
Who in the fuck are you?

1125
01:07:35,001 --> 01:07:37,653
You got something that
belongs to me, a snub nose .38.

1126
01:07:37,653 --> 01:07:39,152
You just scored it
off of Manny in a card game.

1127
01:07:39,152 --> 01:07:40,373
I need it back.

1128
01:07:43,258 --> 01:07:45,113
Fuck.

1129
01:07:45,113 --> 01:07:47,634
I want my fucking gun!

1130
01:07:47,634 --> 01:07:49,562
Where the fuck are you?

1131
01:07:50,503 --> 01:07:52,308
Don't be fucking stupid.

1132
01:07:52,746 --> 01:07:53,753
Fuck!

1133
01:08:06,414 --> 01:08:07,496
Fuck!

1134
01:08:14,394 --> 01:08:15,800
You fuck!

1135
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,459
You fuck!
Where's my fucking gat!

1136
01:08:17,697 --> 01:08:18,779
Help me!

1137
01:08:19,521 --> 01:08:20,528
Where's my gat?

1138
01:08:20,528 --> 01:08:22,293
You going to fucking tell me
where my gun is now?

1139
01:08:22,293 --> 01:08:24,184
Tell me where I can find it,
or in about thirty seconds...

1140
01:08:24,184 --> 01:08:26,453
you're going to have third degree burns.
You know what that means?

1141
01:08:26,453 --> 01:08:29,337
No cock, asshole! You're going to
have a fucking melted dick!

1142
01:08:29,337 --> 01:08:31,158
I--I sold it to a pimp, Lester!

1143
01:08:31,158 --> 01:08:33,047
Say, what you waiting on?

1144
01:08:33,047 --> 01:08:35,153
Where the fuck can I find him?
Where can I find him?

1145
01:08:35,153 --> 01:08:36,338
I need to fucking know now!

1146
01:08:36,338 --> 01:08:38,199
Buckhill Cab, Union Street!

1147
01:08:38,199 --> 01:08:39,440
Ask them!

1148
01:08:46,489 --> 01:08:49,009
Stay here. Do not move.

1149
01:08:58,712 --> 01:09:00,719
I am not touching it.
Get away from me.

1150
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:01,708
Fuck you!

1151
01:09:01,952 --> 01:09:04,505
The little shit!
He just bit me!

1152
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:13,937
Who the hell is that?

1153
01:09:13,937 --> 01:09:17,325
I will go see. Throw me my robe.
Take the kids into the bedroom.

1154
01:09:37,334 --> 01:09:39,603
- May I help you?
- I am looking for Oleg.

1155
01:09:39,603 --> 01:09:41,526
Oleg? You must have
the wrong address.

1156
01:09:41,526 --> 01:09:44,657
No. He's a 10-year-old boy.
He's pale. He never smiles.

1157
01:09:44,657 --> 01:09:46,320
He's my neighbor's kid.

1158
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:48,049
He called me
from this apartment.

1159
01:09:48,049 --> 01:09:50,454
Owens Park Lane, apartment 303.

1160
01:09:50,454 --> 01:09:52,493
Well, he must have given you
the wrong address...

1161
01:09:52,493 --> 01:09:54,923
or maybe you heard wrong.
There's no Oleg here.

1162
01:09:54,923 --> 01:09:57,333
He also said that he was
being held against his will.

1163
01:09:57,333 --> 01:09:59,505
That is ridiculous.
There's only my husband...

1164
01:09:59,505 --> 01:10:02,673
and my 2 children inside--
no one else. And it's late.

1165
01:10:02,673 --> 01:10:04,597
Well, I'd like to take
a little look inside...

1166
01:10:04,597 --> 01:10:05,874
just to satisfy my curiosity.

1167
01:10:05,874 --> 01:10:07,339
This is absurd.
What are you suggesting?

1168
01:10:07,339 --> 01:10:08,592
That I kidnapped Oleg?

1169
01:10:08,592 --> 01:10:09,939
Or you know what?
I am just going to call the police...

1170
01:10:09,939 --> 01:10:11,729
and I am going to stand here
for the next half-hour...

1171
01:10:11,729 --> 01:10:12,878
waiting for them to arrive...

1172
01:10:12,878 --> 01:10:14,226
when all's you got to do
is just let me in.

1173
01:10:17,557 --> 01:10:18,986
If you must.

1174
01:10:33,941 --> 01:10:35,053
Do you mind?

1175
01:10:35,053 --> 01:10:36,783
Go right ahead.

1176
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:41,646
The children's room
is on the right.

1177
01:10:41,646 --> 01:10:43,146
They are asleep.

1178
01:10:43,146 --> 01:10:45,098
Please, go right in.

1179
01:10:56,084 --> 01:10:57,295
Hello.

1180
01:10:57,295 --> 01:10:58,892
Don't even ask.
It's too ridiculous.

1181
01:10:58,892 --> 01:11:01,931
Sorry. I am really embarrassed.

1182
01:11:01,931 --> 01:11:06,314
Excuse me, but I seriously doubt
he's hiding in there.

1183
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:19,050
What's through here?

1184
01:11:19,050 --> 01:11:20,618
The playroom.

1185
01:11:27,571 --> 01:11:29,513
You guys got your own
little Disneyland in here.

1186
01:11:29,513 --> 01:11:31,311
Well, it's all about
the children...

1187
01:11:31,311 --> 01:11:34,543
and as you can see,
there's no Oleg.

1188
01:11:43,698 --> 01:11:46,065
I really hope that you find him.

1189
01:11:46,065 --> 01:11:48,302
You hear too many stories
these days.

1190
01:11:48,302 --> 01:11:50,672
God only knows
if it were our children.

1191
01:11:50,672 --> 01:11:53,325
Where are your children
photographs?

1192
01:11:53,325 --> 01:11:56,461
- Excuse me?
- Photographs.

1193
01:11:56,461 --> 01:12:00,654
No photographs.
If they were your children...

1194
01:12:00,654 --> 01:12:03,308
you would have
at least one photograph...

1195
01:12:03,308 --> 01:12:05,036
somewhere in this apartment.

1196
01:12:05,036 --> 01:12:07,343
This is ridiculous. We only
just moved into this place.

1197
01:12:07,343 --> 01:12:08,556
Everything's in storage.

1198
01:12:08,556 --> 01:12:10,666
Now, I really must
ask you to leave.

1199
01:12:10,666 --> 01:12:12,942
I insist!

1200
01:12:12,942 --> 01:12:14,287
Oleg?

1201
01:12:15,473 --> 01:12:17,262
What the hell
do you want me to do?

1202
01:12:17,262 --> 01:12:21,421
You let this bitch in here
in the first place.

1203
01:12:21,421 --> 01:12:24,457
All right? Right. OK.

1204
01:12:30,033 --> 01:12:33,480
Man. This is too much.

1205
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:36,008
It's too much.
It's like some kind of a lure.

1206
01:12:36,008 --> 01:12:38,634
- You're making a mistake.
- Tell her to leave, Dez.

1207
01:12:38,634 --> 01:12:42,153
Ma'am, if you don't leave right now,
I am calling the police.

1208
01:12:42,153 --> 01:12:44,048
Call them. Call them.
And be sure to mention...

1209
01:12:44,048 --> 01:12:45,935
that you got 2 abducted
children in the next room.

1210
01:12:45,935 --> 01:12:49,449
2 children who don't appear in
any photographs in this house.

1211
01:12:49,449 --> 01:12:50,470
- This is insane.
- Where is Oleg?

1212
01:12:50,470 --> 01:12:52,105
How dare you suggest that we--

1213
01:12:53,648 --> 01:12:55,656
Where's the boy?

1214
01:12:56,624 --> 01:12:58,534
Where is he?!

1215
01:13:12,259 --> 01:13:13,288
God.

1216
01:13:14,231 --> 01:13:16,973
You better pray he's not dead.

1217
01:13:23,183 --> 01:13:24,427
Back off, you sick fuck.

1218
01:13:27,375 --> 01:13:29,709
Jesus. God help me.

1219
01:13:29,709 --> 01:13:33,004
Come on, come on...

1220
01:13:37,743 --> 01:13:39,401
I said back the fuck up...

1221
01:13:39,401 --> 01:13:42,505
you sick, twisted,
motherfucking cunt!

1222
01:13:46,191 --> 01:13:47,238
Holy God.

1223
01:13:47,238 --> 01:13:49,449
That's right.

1224
01:13:49,449 --> 01:13:50,828
That's right. Breathe.
You're going to be OK.

1225
01:13:50,828 --> 01:13:54,178
You're going to breathe now, Oleg.
I am right here. I am right here.

1226
01:13:54,178 --> 01:13:56,775
Just breathe. That's right.

1227
01:13:58,318 --> 01:13:59,068
OK.

1228
01:14:00,174 --> 01:14:02,214
Just cutting through wire.

1229
01:14:06,958 --> 01:14:08,649
Back off!

1230
01:14:08,649 --> 01:14:10,213
I said back off!

1231
01:14:10,213 --> 01:14:12,458
I will blow you away!

1232
01:14:15,246 --> 01:14:18,148
OK. OK, get up.

1233
01:14:18,148 --> 01:14:19,434
OK.

1234
01:14:19,434 --> 01:14:21,127
Go to the bedroom,
get the 2 kids.

1235
01:14:21,127 --> 01:14:22,922
Bring them downstairs.
Nicky's there.

1236
01:14:22,922 --> 01:14:24,812
All right? Wait with them. OK?

1237
01:14:24,812 --> 01:14:25,925
Move over.

1238
01:14:29,517 --> 01:14:31,426
Get out of his way.

1239
01:14:34,668 --> 01:14:36,491
No, I have got a safe
in the bedroom.

1240
01:14:36,491 --> 01:14:38,565
There's 100,000 cash
in there in diamonds.

1241
01:14:38,565 --> 01:14:40,841
All you got to do
is take the boy and walk away.

1242
01:14:53,972 --> 01:14:55,528
My God.

1243
01:14:57,176 --> 01:14:58,185
God.

1244
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:00,551
No.

1245
01:15:03,511 --> 01:15:04,351
My God.

1246
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:07,989
My God.

1247
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:12,260
You sick fucks.

1248
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:14,983
You're right. We're--we're sick.
We are. We're sick.

1249
01:15:14,983 --> 01:15:16,394
This is really great.
This is going to help us--

1250
01:15:16,394 --> 01:15:18,435
- Give me your phone.
- Please. Yeah.

1251
01:15:18,435 --> 01:15:20,133
- What are you doing?
- She wants the phone--

1252
01:15:20,133 --> 01:15:21,546
Who are you calling?

1253
01:15:26,571 --> 01:15:29,189
911. What is the nature
of your emergency?

1254
01:15:29,189 --> 01:15:31,682
I just heard shooting
across the hall.

1255
01:15:31,682 --> 01:15:33,479
1456 Owens Park Lane.

1256
01:15:33,479 --> 01:15:35,009
What is your name, ma'am?

1257
01:15:36,810 --> 01:15:38,272
You're not serious.

1258
01:15:44,875 --> 01:15:45,625
OK.

1259
01:15:56,426 --> 01:15:58,117
Hey. Hey, listen,
one of your cabs...

1260
01:15:58,117 --> 01:16:00,642
just picked up my brother
at Al's Automotive.

1261
01:16:00,642 --> 01:16:02,438
Yeah, well, listen--
listen to me.

1262
01:16:02,438 --> 01:16:05,376
I was supposed to pick him up,
but there's been a family emergency.

1263
01:16:05,376 --> 01:16:07,425
So what I need you to do
is I need you to find out...

1264
01:16:07,425 --> 01:16:09,408
where the cab
dropped him off at.

1265
01:16:09,408 --> 01:16:13,726
Yeah. Call me back.
My phone number's 555-7556.

1266
01:16:17,674 --> 01:16:20,608
Hello? Yeah.

1267
01:16:20,608 --> 01:16:22,308
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

1268
01:16:22,308 --> 01:16:23,523
Hey, calm down.

1269
01:16:36,136 --> 01:16:37,446
What happened to your face?

1270
01:16:37,446 --> 01:16:38,561
It's nothing.

1271
01:16:38,561 --> 01:16:40,029
I need to talk to you, Joe.

1272
01:16:40,029 --> 01:16:41,763
- Later.
- No. Now!

1273
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:43,840
Why couldn't you just have
taken the kid and left?

1274
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:45,953
Why couldn't you just have
taken the kid and left?!

1275
01:16:45,953 --> 01:16:49,254
I have never seen evil
before tonight, Joe.

1276
01:16:49,254 --> 01:16:51,655
Real fucking evil.

1277
01:16:51,655 --> 01:16:52,405
OK?

1278
01:16:53,128 --> 01:16:57,601
And I know that's not what I see
when I look in your eyes.

1279
01:16:57,601 --> 01:16:59,047
That's a lot, T.

1280
01:16:59,047 --> 01:17:00,836
I am trying to make a point here!

1281
01:17:00,836 --> 01:17:03,109
No, I know the point
you're trying to make!

1282
01:17:03,109 --> 01:17:05,926
I did not marry an evil man, OK?

1283
01:17:05,926 --> 01:17:08,415
I did not marry an evil man.

1284
01:17:08,415 --> 01:17:11,936
Shady, sleazy, mixed up with
the wrong kind of people...

1285
01:17:11,936 --> 01:17:14,561
but definitely not evil.

1286
01:17:14,561 --> 01:17:16,901
I know what you're
trying to say, T.

1287
01:17:16,901 --> 01:17:18,878
Do you?!

1288
01:17:20,039 --> 01:17:22,014
I hope so.
I have turned my back...

1289
01:17:22,014 --> 01:17:24,640
on a lot of things
since we have been married.

1290
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,045
My eyes are wide open
on this one.

1291
01:17:35,271 --> 01:17:37,638
Nicky, go home with your ma.

1292
01:17:37,638 --> 01:17:39,296
Oleg, let's go take a ride.

1293
01:17:52,838 --> 01:17:55,685
What kind of music
do you listen to?

1294
01:17:57,618 --> 01:17:59,214
You listen to that techno shit?

1295
01:18:00,070 --> 01:18:02,939
You listen to rap music?
You like rap music?

1296
01:18:03,281 --> 01:18:05,218
They don't have
what I listen to on the radio.

1297
01:18:05,218 --> 01:18:06,595
Yeah, what's that?

1298
01:18:06,595 --> 01:18:07,840
Kvasha.

1299
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:10,528
It's my mother's tape
from Russia.

1300
01:18:10,528 --> 01:18:13,086
What the fuck? Kvasha?

1301
01:18:15,077 --> 01:18:16,866
You're an American.
You weren't born in Russia.

1302
01:18:16,866 --> 01:18:18,724
What are you listening
to that shit for?

1303
01:18:18,724 --> 01:18:21,604
My mother said I started
in her belly in Russia.

1304
01:18:21,604 --> 01:18:22,914
So I am Russian.

1305
01:18:22,914 --> 01:18:25,185
You're not a fucking Russian.
You're an American. You know that.

1306
01:18:25,185 --> 01:18:26,814
because you were born
in the United States of America.

1307
01:18:26,814 --> 01:18:28,282
You're an American.
You're an American.

1308
01:18:28,282 --> 01:18:29,951
Say, "I am an American."
You say it.

1309
01:18:29,951 --> 01:18:32,607
Say, "I am an American."
Say, "I am an American."

1310
01:18:32,607 --> 01:18:33,790
I am an American.

1311
01:18:33,790 --> 01:18:36,546
You're an American. You were born
in the fucking United States of America.

1312
01:18:36,546 --> 01:18:38,336
That makes you an American.

1313
01:18:38,336 --> 01:18:39,802
Listen to this.

1314
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:44,126
This guy right here is going to be
warming up the back seat for you...

1315
01:18:44,126 --> 01:18:47,034
when you're ready to get laid.
You mark my words.

1316
01:18:47,034 --> 01:18:50,306
<i>* Oh, I know
that it's getting late...</i>

1317
01:18:50,306 --> 01:18:52,860
Fucking Kvasha. Jesus Christ.

1318
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:54,209
You put me through
the ringer tonight.

1319
01:18:54,209 --> 01:18:55,488
You know that, don't you?

1320
01:18:57,988 --> 01:18:59,482
I won't say nothing.

1321
01:18:59,482 --> 01:19:00,734
Yeah, and what about the cops?

1322
01:19:00,734 --> 01:19:02,081
What'd you say to them?
What did you say to them?

1323
01:19:02,081 --> 01:19:05,280
I told them I got the gun
from Steven Monroe's locker.

1324
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:08,796
He doesn't go there no more.
Nicky told me to say that.

1325
01:19:08,796 --> 01:19:10,559
Nicky told you to say that?

1326
01:19:10,559 --> 01:19:12,002
Smart kid.

1327
01:19:12,002 --> 01:19:14,719
He's my best friend.
We're both going to play for the Razors.

1328
01:19:15,939 --> 01:19:17,565
Yeah. Hello?

1329
01:19:17,565 --> 01:19:19,545
Yeah, that was me.

1330
01:19:19,545 --> 01:19:21,376
The Royal Towers?
How long ago?

1331
01:19:21,376 --> 01:19:23,353
All right, thanks.

1332
01:19:23,353 --> 01:19:24,573
All right, kid. Hold on.

1333
01:19:24,573 --> 01:19:26,815
We're going to reclaim
some stolen property here.

1334
01:19:48,322 --> 01:19:49,402
Don't worry about it.

1335
01:19:49,402 --> 01:19:51,646
We're just going to sit tight
for a while.

1336
01:19:52,738 --> 01:19:53,916
You know...

1337
01:19:56,738 --> 01:19:58,593
I used to know this kid.

1338
01:20:00,514 --> 01:20:03,448
His old man was
a real fucking piece of shit.

1339
01:20:05,505 --> 01:20:07,807
Always drunk.

1340
01:20:09,474 --> 01:20:11,808
Always smacking him
and his mom around.

1341
01:20:14,209 --> 01:20:16,991
This kid, he takes his licks...

1342
01:20:16,991 --> 01:20:19,960
and he waits
this old fucking prick out.

1343
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:24,343
And on the morning
of his 14th birthday...

1344
01:20:24,343 --> 01:20:27,647
he walks into his old man's room
with a baseball bat...

1345
01:20:30,881 --> 01:20:33,848
and he Mark McGwires the fucking
living shit out of him.

1346
01:20:37,153 --> 01:20:39,574
After that, the old man...

1347
01:20:39,574 --> 01:20:42,518
he can't even hold a spoon
without shaking.

1348
01:20:44,928 --> 01:20:47,197
He don't remember things
too good, either.

1349
01:20:47,197 --> 01:20:49,207
He's neutralized.

1350
01:20:51,777 --> 01:20:53,882
Which is a good thing.

1351
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:57,178
4 more years max.

1352
01:20:57,178 --> 01:20:59,071
Maybe 3.
If you get some size early on...

1353
01:20:59,071 --> 01:21:01,046
you will be all right.
You just got to hang in there.

1354
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:05,883
because it's more money.

1355
01:21:05,883 --> 01:21:07,709
It's lonely at the top.

1356
01:21:07,709 --> 01:21:09,817
I am telling you,
this corporation...

1357
01:21:11,072 --> 01:21:12,632
Get your hands off
of Lester's property.

1358
01:21:12,632 --> 01:21:15,835
- That's my property.
- I am sorry.

1359
01:21:15,835 --> 01:21:18,173
All right, you stay right there.
Don't you move.

1360
01:21:19,423 --> 01:21:21,310
Stay just like that.

1361
01:21:21,310 --> 01:21:22,390
Fuck.

1362
01:21:26,367 --> 01:21:28,506
Jesus Christ. Not now.

1363
01:21:30,847 --> 01:21:32,821
All right, let's get in the car.

1364
01:21:34,079 --> 01:21:36,348
I can hide it for you.

1365
01:21:36,348 --> 01:21:39,798
No, give it to me.
They're going to think you got the .38.

1366
01:21:39,798 --> 01:21:43,002
They're going to frisk you.
Come on, give me the fucking gun.

1367
01:21:53,406 --> 01:21:55,446
Yo, Joe.

1368
01:21:55,446 --> 01:21:56,948
Who you got there?

1369
01:22:01,278 --> 01:22:02,871
He's one of them
Christmas elves.

1370
01:22:02,871 --> 01:22:04,503
I found him hitching a ride
on Broad Street.

1371
01:22:06,505 --> 01:22:08,522
Joey's a funny fucking guy...

1372
01:22:09,258 --> 01:22:12,918
Let me take a guess, Joey--
you were just about to call us.

1373
01:22:13,558 --> 01:22:16,056
That's pretty good. You must
have telepathy or something.

1374
01:22:16,056 --> 01:22:19,093
Must. Give me your piece.

1375
01:22:20,446 --> 01:22:22,234
Think I am fucking around
with you?

1376
01:22:24,509 --> 01:22:25,735
How about that?

1377
01:22:26,173 --> 01:22:28,060
Cocked and ready to go.

1378
01:22:28,060 --> 01:22:30,067
What are you,
fucking nervous, tough guy?

1379
01:22:32,605 --> 01:22:34,744
You're going to follow us, Joey.

1380
01:22:36,316 --> 01:22:38,804
The kid will ride with us.

1381
01:22:54,460 --> 01:22:55,801
Stay the fuck in the car.

1382
01:23:03,996 --> 01:23:05,785
Yeah.

1383
01:23:05,785 --> 01:23:08,755
Nah, nah.
I am with him right now.

1384
01:23:08,755 --> 01:23:10,454
Yeah, 100%.

1385
01:23:12,668 --> 01:23:15,537
I fucking knew it.

1386
01:23:15,537 --> 01:23:17,586
Nah, don't worry about it.

1387
01:23:17,586 --> 01:23:19,929
I am taking care
of this motherfucker right now.

1388
01:23:26,427 --> 01:23:27,922
Come on, what the fuck?

1389
01:23:27,922 --> 01:23:30,199
What, are you going to
fucking whack me?

1390
01:23:31,355 --> 01:23:32,762
Come on, man,
I fucking told you.

1391
01:23:32,762 --> 01:23:34,388
You got any fucking doubts,
I am fucking telling you--

1392
01:23:34,388 --> 01:23:38,103
Shut your mouth.
Shut your fucking mouth now.

1393
01:23:38,103 --> 01:23:40,954
You see, my old man...

1394
01:23:40,954 --> 01:23:44,005
he says to me, "Nobody...

1395
01:23:44,806 --> 01:23:45,905
knows nobody."

1396
01:23:45,905 --> 01:23:48,344
Man, you fucking put
that piece of shit away.

1397
01:23:48,344 --> 01:23:51,061
I fucking told you,
on my fucking family--

1398
01:23:51,061 --> 01:23:54,000
Fucking family? When I leave here,
I am going to fuck Teresa in the ass.

1399
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,464
That's how much I give a fuck
about your fucking family.

1400
01:23:56,464 --> 01:23:59,440
On my fucking family,
it ain't the fucking piece!

1401
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:01,140
Now, how fucking far
do we go back?

1402
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:02,585
How fucking long
have we known each other?

1403
01:24:02,585 --> 01:24:04,505
Come on, what the fuck?!

1404
01:24:04,505 --> 01:24:05,781
This is bullshit!

1405
01:24:05,781 --> 01:24:08,152
Like I said, nobody...

1406
01:24:08,152 --> 01:24:10,095
knows nobody.

1407
01:24:11,994 --> 01:24:14,415
You fucking take
that shit off me--

1408
01:24:15,482 --> 01:24:17,554
- Not in front of the fucking kid.
- What kid?

1409
01:24:17,554 --> 01:24:18,870
Not in front of the fucking--

1410
01:24:18,870 --> 01:24:21,491
You grab this fucking gun
out of my hand one more time...

1411
01:24:21,491 --> 01:24:23,951
I am going to blow your fucking brains
all over this fucking place...

1412
01:24:23,951 --> 01:24:26,262
and I will fuck that kid up
right in front of you!

1413
01:24:26,262 --> 01:24:30,159
You got that, nigger?!
Nobody knows nobody! You got that?!

1414
01:24:35,641 --> 01:24:38,008
Shit! What the fuck?!

1415
01:24:39,608 --> 01:24:40,782
Shit.

1416
01:24:40,782 --> 01:24:45,745
You see, Pop reached out
to a friend of ours in the department...

1417
01:24:45,745 --> 01:24:49,429
had him pull the paper
on Rydell's recent busts.

1418
01:24:49,429 --> 01:24:50,926
Turns out our friend Sal here...

1419
01:24:50,926 --> 01:24:53,651
was running his own little thing
on the side.

1420
01:24:53,651 --> 01:24:54,768
Hey, Sal.

1421
01:24:54,768 --> 01:24:56,822
How's fucking business?

1422
01:24:57,656 --> 01:25:00,689
A few weeks back,
Sal gets bagged...

1423
01:25:00,689 --> 01:25:02,735
by Rydell and his partners.

1424
01:25:02,735 --> 01:25:04,532
They let him walk...

1425
01:25:04,532 --> 01:25:08,496
as a situated informant.

1426
01:25:08,496 --> 01:25:11,121
We just got confirmation
10 minutes ago.

1427
01:25:11,121 --> 01:25:13,429
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Get the fuck up.

1428
01:25:13,429 --> 01:25:16,147
Get the fuck up.

1429
01:25:17,328 --> 01:25:18,375
Yeah.

1430
01:25:18,715 --> 01:25:19,871
Yeah.

1431
01:25:20,608 --> 01:25:22,182
He's alone?

1432
01:25:22,423 --> 01:25:24,812
Good. Give me
the fucking number.

1433
01:25:32,598 --> 01:25:35,151
Have a mai tai on me, guys.

1434
01:25:36,471 --> 01:25:38,959
One Nike gym bag--

1435
01:25:38,959 --> 01:25:40,406
60 bucks.

1436
01:25:53,878 --> 01:25:56,911
You motherfucking
guinea cocksuckers.

1437
01:25:58,102 --> 01:26:00,339
One Nokia cell phone--

1438
01:26:00,339 --> 01:26:01,683
100 bucks.

1439
01:26:06,230 --> 01:26:08,783
You have just fucked yourselves!

1440
01:26:08,783 --> 01:26:10,861
One ounce Semtex--

1441
01:26:10,861 --> 01:26:12,625
500 bucks.

1442
01:26:15,189 --> 01:26:17,523
Getting rid of a dirty cop--

1443
01:26:19,413 --> 01:26:22,642
Fucking priceless.

1444
01:26:22,642 --> 01:26:24,138
Now...

1445
01:26:24,138 --> 01:26:26,864
the jury's still out on you,
pal, so do me a favor.

1446
01:26:26,864 --> 01:26:28,843
Get your ass in that car
and follow me.

1447
01:26:28,843 --> 01:26:30,772
And hey, hey.

1448
01:26:30,772 --> 01:26:32,266
Don't get lost.

1449
01:26:32,266 --> 01:26:34,414
Where the fuck we going?

1450
01:27:26,675 --> 01:27:29,196
Come on down, come on down.

1451
01:27:36,499 --> 01:27:37,676
Let him go.

1452
01:27:42,098 --> 01:27:44,432
So, Oleg...

1453
01:27:44,432 --> 01:27:46,954
you want to see
something really cool?

1454
01:27:53,811 --> 01:27:55,785
It's called a jet ice.

1455
01:27:55,785 --> 01:27:57,899
Black light paint.

1456
01:27:57,899 --> 01:28:00,873
You got to do crazy shit
like this to fill the seats.

1457
01:28:08,250 --> 01:28:10,001
Now, Oleg,

1458
01:28:10,550 --> 01:28:13,101
this is very serious matter.

1459
01:28:14,238 --> 01:28:15,787
This man--

1460
01:28:16,322 --> 01:28:19,533
he give you the gun
to shoot Anzor?

1461
01:28:20,497 --> 01:28:22,602
Bullshit! He gave it to you!

1462
01:28:22,602 --> 01:28:25,641
He told you to whack me!
Stop fucking protecting him!

1463
01:28:25,641 --> 01:28:29,243
You shut the fuck up.

1464
01:28:30,609 --> 01:28:33,707
Oleg, you listen to me.

1465
01:28:33,707 --> 01:28:36,166
Where did you get gun?

1466
01:28:36,166 --> 01:28:37,834
At school.

1467
01:28:37,834 --> 01:28:39,945
I found it in a locker.

1468
01:28:39,945 --> 01:28:42,407
Don't you fucking touch him!
You don't fucking touch him!

1469
01:28:42,407 --> 01:28:44,750
Don't you fucking touch him!
I will fucking kill you!

1470
01:28:44,750 --> 01:28:47,168
You shut the fuck up!
Your turn is coming.

1471
01:28:47,168 --> 01:28:49,098
Yeah?
Well, fucking eat me!

1472
01:28:49,098 --> 01:28:52,038
You fucking vor cocksucking bitch!
Fuck you!

1473
01:28:52,038 --> 01:28:53,422
What you call me?

1474
01:28:53,422 --> 01:28:55,976
Nah, you fucking heard me.
Fuck you, you fucking bitch!

1475
01:28:55,976 --> 01:28:59,180
I am impressed. You know vor.

1476
01:29:01,744 --> 01:29:04,046
Vor v'zakoni.

1477
01:29:04,046 --> 01:29:07,342
The Brotherhood.
If you were smart man...

1478
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:10,157
you would learn
to fear this symbol.

1479
01:29:10,157 --> 01:29:12,777
Yeah, well, fuck you, and fuck
your brotherhood, Boris...

1480
01:29:12,777 --> 01:29:14,572
because I don't have
to fucking answer to you!

1481
01:29:14,572 --> 01:29:15,981
Fuck you!

1482
01:29:17,168 --> 01:29:18,858
You going to let him muscle me around
like this, Frankie?

1483
01:29:18,858 --> 01:29:21,764
Well, we're just trying to
establish some truth here, Joe.

1484
01:29:21,764 --> 01:29:22,985
I mean, to be honest...

1485
01:29:22,985 --> 01:29:24,878
I think the man's got
some grounds for inquiry.

1486
01:29:24,878 --> 01:29:26,983
No, that's fucking bullshit.
I told you...

1487
01:29:26,983 --> 01:29:28,430
I didn't give the kid
the fucking piece.

1488
01:29:28,430 --> 01:29:29,608
Come on, Frankie!

1489
01:29:30,047 --> 01:29:31,305
Come on!
What the fuck, Frankie?!

1490
01:29:31,305 --> 01:29:33,448
I told you, I didn't give him
the fucking piece!

1491
01:29:33,448 --> 01:29:35,014
Don't you let them hurt
the fucking kid, Anzor!

1492
01:29:35,014 --> 01:29:36,615
Don't you fucking hurt the kid!

1493
01:29:38,063 --> 01:29:40,397
You fucks!
You fucking motherfuckers!

1494
01:29:40,397 --> 01:29:42,056
I am going to fucking kill you!

1495
01:29:43,854 --> 01:29:45,829
How's that feel, Joey?

1496
01:29:47,406 --> 01:29:49,097
Fuck you, Tommy!

1497
01:29:49,097 --> 01:29:52,647
Don't you do this, Frankie.
Don't you do it!

1498
01:29:52,647 --> 01:29:54,312
Don't you fucking
let them do this!

1499
01:29:55,790 --> 01:29:59,751
I am not fucking lying!
I am not fucking lying!

1500
01:29:59,751 --> 01:30:01,764
Fuck!

1501
01:30:03,566 --> 01:30:05,420
Just tell them
what they want to know!

1502
01:30:07,241 --> 01:30:09,607
Fuck! I told you
I didn't know anything, Frankie!

1503
01:30:09,846 --> 01:30:10,928
Fuck!

1504
01:30:12,013 --> 01:30:13,093
Fuck!

1505
01:30:13,093 --> 01:30:14,726
Shit, it's a fucking
human hockey puck.

1506
01:30:14,726 --> 01:30:16,195
I am going to fucking kill you!

1507
01:30:16,195 --> 01:30:18,605
You're going to kill me?
You're going to fucking kill me?

1508
01:30:20,621 --> 01:30:21,931
Give Anzor the gun.

1509
01:30:21,931 --> 01:30:23,307
Frankie, don't you fucking
let them do this!

1510
01:30:23,307 --> 01:30:24,770
Kill the kid.

1511
01:30:26,061 --> 01:30:27,916
Christ.

1512
01:30:27,916 --> 01:30:31,146
I am going to fucking kill you!

1513
01:30:35,149 --> 01:30:36,555
Don't you let them do this,
Frankie!

1514
01:30:36,555 --> 01:30:39,491
What do you want me to do?
You brought it on your goddamn self!

1515
01:30:39,491 --> 01:30:41,921
No. No. Wait, no!

1516
01:30:41,921 --> 01:30:42,913
Don't do it!

1517
01:30:42,913 --> 01:30:44,134
Joey...

1518
01:30:44,134 --> 01:30:46,409
I will fucking talk!
I will fucking tell you...

1519
01:30:46,409 --> 01:30:48,583
whatever you want
to fucking hear!

1520
01:30:48,583 --> 01:30:49,733
No, my friend!

1521
01:30:49,733 --> 01:30:51,463
First you will see
that I am serious.

1522
01:30:51,463 --> 01:30:54,500
Then afterwards, believe me,
you will talk!

1523
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:56,449
No, come on!
Jesus Christ! I am fucking--

1524
01:30:56,449 --> 01:30:58,467
Don't you--
I will fucking talk!

1525
01:30:58,467 --> 01:30:59,970
I will tell you whatever
the fuck you want to hear...

1526
01:30:59,970 --> 01:31:01,572
you fucking motherfuckers!

1527
01:31:01,572 --> 01:31:04,000
Finish it!
Do it right this time!

1528
01:31:05,099 --> 01:31:07,009
No, Anzor!

1529
01:31:07,009 --> 01:31:08,775
Anzor, look at me!
Don't fucking do it!

1530
01:31:08,775 --> 01:31:09,924
Shut up!

1531
01:31:11,211 --> 01:31:12,738
I said finish it.

1532
01:31:13,932 --> 01:31:15,110
He's not your blood!

1533
01:31:15,110 --> 01:31:18,017
Don't fucking do it.
If you do it, I swear to God...

1534
01:31:18,017 --> 01:31:19,848
you better fucking
swallow a bullet.

1535
01:31:19,848 --> 01:31:22,404
There's no fucking way you're going to
be able to live with yourself!

1536
01:31:22,404 --> 01:31:24,712
Trust me, Anzor. Don't do it!

1537
01:31:25,148 --> 01:31:27,114
Say something bad about the Duke.

1538
01:31:27,747 --> 01:31:30,446
Let me hear you call him a faggot.

1539
01:31:30,783 --> 01:31:31,825
Come on.

1540
01:31:32,559 --> 01:31:34,147
Don't do it!

1541
01:31:34,787 --> 01:31:35,992
Say it.

1542
01:31:36,882 --> 01:31:38,144
<i>Shoot him!</i>

1543
01:32:04,265 --> 01:32:06,567
What are you fucking doing?!

1544
01:32:08,522 --> 01:32:10,529
Pick up the fucking gun.

1545
01:32:10,870 --> 01:32:13,352
You pick it up.

1546
01:32:13,352 --> 01:32:15,174
You do it.

1547
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:21,032
Gutless piece of faggot shit!

1548
01:32:21,032 --> 01:32:23,749
Come on, faggot!

1549
01:32:23,749 --> 01:32:26,502
I said finish it!

1550
01:32:28,169 --> 01:32:30,886
Pick it up and use it.

1551
01:32:32,905 --> 01:32:35,360
Pick it up and do it.

1552
01:32:38,089 --> 01:32:40,478
Pick it up and do it.

1553
01:32:44,936 --> 01:32:47,489
Don't you fucking
walk away from me!

1554
01:33:06,311 --> 01:33:08,678
Get up...

1555
01:33:08,678 --> 01:33:10,468
you fuck.

1556
01:33:16,679 --> 01:33:18,654
Fucking bullshit.

1557
01:33:18,654 --> 01:33:20,484
Frank! Frank!

1558
01:33:20,484 --> 01:33:21,861
Fuck you, Frankie!

1559
01:33:21,861 --> 01:33:24,099
I ain't taking the fucking heat
for you no more!

1560
01:33:24,099 --> 01:33:27,431
It wasn't supposed
to go down this way!

1561
01:33:27,431 --> 01:33:28,543
What are you talking about?

1562
01:33:28,543 --> 01:33:30,950
The Czar of Brighton.

1563
01:33:30,950 --> 01:33:33,154
Vor whatever the fuck you are.

1564
01:33:33,154 --> 01:33:34,946
Fucking Perello
didn't like it...

1565
01:33:34,946 --> 01:33:38,758
that your nephew was cooking
a dealer in the neighborhood.

1566
01:33:38,758 --> 01:33:40,133
So he said--

1567
01:33:40,133 --> 01:33:42,687
he said, "Well,
let's send him a message."

1568
01:33:42,687 --> 01:33:44,865
He said, "Let's use the kid."

1569
01:33:44,865 --> 01:33:47,620
Yogi, would I put
our thing in jeopardy...

1570
01:33:47,620 --> 01:33:50,338
for some 2-bit fucking meth lab?

1571
01:33:50,338 --> 01:33:52,643
Think about it, OK?
That's number 1.

1572
01:33:52,643 --> 01:33:56,540
Number 2--I don't even live
in that fucking neighborhood!

1573
01:33:56,540 --> 01:33:58,305
What do I care if it blows up?

1574
01:33:58,305 --> 01:34:00,481
The gun--

1575
01:34:00,481 --> 01:34:02,373
it was Tommy's!

1576
01:34:02,373 --> 01:34:03,616
You fuck!

1577
01:34:04,869 --> 01:34:08,001
Tommy. Tommy, don't get involved
in their goddamn jackpot!

1578
01:34:08,001 --> 01:34:09,347
It's all bullshit!

1579
01:34:09,347 --> 01:34:11,236
He fucking put it
in my right hand!

1580
01:34:11,236 --> 01:34:14,237
A fucking snub nose .38,
stainless steel.

1581
01:34:14,237 --> 01:34:15,739
It was Tommy's gun!

1582
01:34:15,739 --> 01:34:17,341
You motherfucker.

1583
01:34:17,882 --> 01:34:19,748
I told you to get rid
of that fucking piece.

1584
01:34:19,748 --> 01:34:21,756
Yeah, well,
not to my fucking recollection!

1585
01:34:22,497 --> 01:34:23,739
He said...

1586
01:34:23,739 --> 01:34:25,570
"Interest the tweaker's kid
in the piece."

1587
01:34:25,570 --> 01:34:27,361
That's what he said.

1588
01:34:27,361 --> 01:34:29,437
"Interest the tweaker's kid
in the piece."

1589
01:34:29,437 --> 01:34:31,898
Ask the kid!

1590
01:34:31,898 --> 01:34:33,599
Ask the kid.

1591
01:34:33,599 --> 01:34:37,052
Mister, because he--
he gave me the gun.

1592
01:34:37,052 --> 01:34:41,915
He said I'd get to go to the game if--
if I shot Anzor...

1593
01:34:41,915 --> 01:34:43,778
and it would make
his friends happy.

1594
01:34:43,778 --> 01:34:45,853
I am sorry, kid.

1595
01:34:45,853 --> 01:34:47,386
OK. OK.

1596
01:34:47,386 --> 01:34:48,890
Fuck this bullshit.

1597
01:34:48,890 --> 01:34:50,655
Fuck you, Joey!

1598
01:34:50,655 --> 01:34:51,953
You fucking bastard!

1599
01:34:52,197 --> 01:34:53,822
You're fucking dead, nigger!

1600
01:35:04,100 --> 01:35:05,594
I am fucking shot!

1601
01:35:05,594 --> 01:35:07,578
You dancing bear motherfucker!

1602
01:35:07,578 --> 01:35:08,764
Fucking vor!

1603
01:35:11,844 --> 01:35:13,088
Scumbag!

1604
01:35:13,088 --> 01:35:15,294
You Russian cocksucker.

1605
01:35:22,564 --> 01:35:24,222
You son of a bitch!

1606
01:35:25,159 --> 01:35:26,663
Die, you fucker!

1607
01:35:31,107 --> 01:35:33,212
You die, motherfucker!

1608
01:35:34,754 --> 01:35:36,056
Where's the fucking gun?

1609
01:36:02,114 --> 01:36:04,602
Mr. Gazelle!

1610
01:36:52,449 --> 01:36:53,910
Fuck you.

1611
01:37:11,359 --> 01:37:13,531
Get off him, you fuck.

1612
01:37:13,531 --> 01:37:16,917
Do you know you got my son killed,
you fucking scumbag?!

1613
01:37:16,917 --> 01:37:20,928
Frankie, I am glad it's you
because there's something I have been--

1614
01:37:20,928 --> 01:37:23,030
I have really been meaning
to get off my chest.

1615
01:37:23,030 --> 01:37:27,130
You rat cocksucker.
All this fucking time?!

1616
01:37:27,130 --> 01:37:30,396
Yeah, this whole fucking time!
This whole fucking time!

1617
01:37:30,396 --> 01:37:31,991
And the only thing
we don't have...

1618
01:37:31,991 --> 01:37:33,689
is your finger on the trigger,
so fucking do me!

1619
01:37:33,689 --> 01:37:34,840
And it's one more nail
in your coffin.

1620
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:36,734
You got all that, do you?

1621
01:37:36,734 --> 01:37:39,581
How come it took you
so fucking long, tough guy?

1622
01:37:40,115 --> 01:37:42,364
How come so fucking long?!
Tell me!

1623
01:37:42,364 --> 01:37:44,570
You had to climb in bed
with Yugorsky, didn't you?

1624
01:37:44,570 --> 01:37:45,883
I was all but out...

1625
01:37:45,883 --> 01:37:48,700
and you had to go mix up
with the fucking Russians.

1626
01:37:48,700 --> 01:37:50,109
12 years undercover...

1627
01:37:50,109 --> 01:37:51,899
and my own wife
don't even fucking know!

1628
01:37:51,899 --> 01:37:54,356
You cocksucker.
You don't have to worry.

1629
01:37:55,614 --> 01:37:58,428
She ain't never going to hear it
from your fucking lips anyhow...

1630
01:37:58,428 --> 01:38:00,371
you fucking scumbag!

1631
01:38:01,438 --> 01:38:06,075
I will tell her all about it
while she sucks my fucking dick!

1632
01:38:13,122 --> 01:38:15,640
Come on. Come on!

1633
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:17,914
Are you fucking kidding me?

1634
01:38:21,405 --> 01:38:23,315
What are you going to do with that,
little boy?

1635
01:38:23,315 --> 01:38:24,818
Do you know that
I had a little boy?

1636
01:38:24,818 --> 01:38:27,993
My Tommy.
At one time, he was your age.

1637
01:38:27,993 --> 01:38:29,753
What are you going to do
with that, kid?

1638
01:38:29,753 --> 01:38:31,065
What are you going to do with that?

1639
01:38:31,065 --> 01:38:32,562
What are you going to do
with that...

1640
01:38:32,562 --> 01:38:34,939
you Cheerio-bred
little motherfucker?!

1641
01:38:55,644 --> 01:38:57,400
Let's go home.

1642
01:39:30,971 --> 01:39:32,531
In position!

1643
01:39:32,531 --> 01:39:35,026
All right, Johnny!
On the other side! Let's go!

1644
01:39:43,067 --> 01:39:45,139
Jesus Christ, Joey.
We got shorted out.

1645
01:39:45,139 --> 01:39:46,356
We lost you back at Newark.

1646
01:39:46,356 --> 01:39:48,948
Last thing we heard, you were
headed for Little Odessa.

1647
01:39:48,948 --> 01:39:51,540
Air support
finally made your Mustang.

1648
01:39:51,540 --> 01:39:54,677
I am taking the kid home
to his mom.

1649
01:39:54,677 --> 01:39:56,088
Joey, where you going?

1650
01:39:56,088 --> 01:39:59,286
You're hurt.
We got to get you to a hospital.

1651
01:40:00,922 --> 01:40:02,678
I am going home.

1652
01:40:15,513 --> 01:40:17,422
What are you thinking?

1653
01:40:17,422 --> 01:40:19,320
I don't want to go home.

1654
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:21,360
Well, I am next door to you,
remember...

1655
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:23,922
and I am going to be
keeping my eye on you.

1656
01:40:30,169 --> 01:40:31,478
Why don't we get
some breakfast...

1657
01:40:31,478 --> 01:40:33,968
before we have to start making
with the heavy explaining.

1658
01:40:33,968 --> 01:40:36,081
Get ourselves cleaned up a bit.

1659
01:41:01,336 --> 01:41:02,645
Hey, listen.

1660
01:41:02,645 --> 01:41:06,608
I am taking Nick to the game
on Friday night.

1661
01:41:06,608 --> 01:41:09,200
Maybe we could find you
another ticket.

1662
01:41:11,832 --> 01:41:14,166
If you'd like to go, that is.

1663
01:41:25,751 --> 01:41:28,947
All right, that's good.

1664
01:41:28,947 --> 01:41:30,706
You want to get some more
orange juice or something?

1665
01:41:38,595 --> 01:41:39,756
Right.

1666
01:41:42,018 --> 01:41:43,409
Well...

1667
01:41:43,746 --> 01:41:45,519
what do you say
we get out of here?

1668
01:41:58,518 --> 01:42:00,274
Well, lookie, lookie...

1669
01:42:00,274 --> 01:42:02,699
if it ain't
little Charlie Bronson.

1670
01:42:04,918 --> 01:42:06,030
One thing about Lester...

1671
01:42:06,030 --> 01:42:08,208
he always makes good
on a promise.

1672
01:42:08,208 --> 01:42:09,707
Hey, asshole.

1673
01:42:12,129 --> 01:42:13,585
Motherfucker!

1674
01:42:13,585 --> 01:42:14,767
Shoot that fuck!

1675
01:42:15,829 --> 01:42:17,007
Fuck him up!

1676
01:42:17,007 --> 01:42:18,638
Fucking piece of shit!

1677
01:42:18,638 --> 01:42:21,580
- Plug that asshole!
- Cocksucker!

1678
01:42:22,222 --> 01:42:23,662
Shit!

1679
01:42:23,662 --> 01:42:25,489
In your face, motherfucker!

1680
01:42:30,741 --> 01:42:32,880
Say hello to my little friend.

1681
01:42:34,017 --> 01:42:35,600
That's real fucking original.

1682
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:37,327
What are you, a fucking cartoon?

1683
01:42:37,327 --> 01:42:40,267
I am a mack daddy pimp.
You know that.

1684
01:42:40,267 --> 01:42:44,204
And now I am going to cap your ass.
And when I am finished with you...

1685
01:42:44,204 --> 01:42:46,132
I am going to take
your little punk friend...

1686
01:42:46,132 --> 01:42:48,554
and I am going to put him
in my posse...

1687
01:42:48,554 --> 01:42:50,866
and I am going to pimp him out
for a couple of months.

1688
01:42:50,866 --> 01:42:52,461
And then I am going to take
that knife of yours...

1689
01:42:52,461 --> 01:42:54,191
and I am going to cut him
from ear to ear...

1690
01:42:54,191 --> 01:42:56,617
just like I should have done
yesterday, you fuck!

1691
01:42:56,617 --> 01:42:59,180
I am sure that sounds great to you all
in your fucking pimp world and all...

1692
01:42:59,180 --> 01:43:00,594
but, listen, right now...

1693
01:43:00,594 --> 01:43:02,220
that's not the fucking thing
you want to do!

1694
01:43:02,220 --> 01:43:03,820
You want to put down
that fucking gun...

1695
01:43:03,820 --> 01:43:06,162
and you want to walk away,
because I swear to fucking God...

1696
01:43:06,162 --> 01:43:08,879
I will fucking kill you,
you stupid fucking pimp bitch!

1697
01:43:08,879 --> 01:43:12,330
Wrong! Only one of us
is walking out of here.

1698
01:43:12,330 --> 01:43:14,673
- Guess who?
- Oleg, get behind me.

1699
01:43:17,363 --> 01:43:18,508
Oleg, get behind me!

1700
01:43:39,090 --> 01:43:40,749
Come on.

1701
01:43:40,749 --> 01:43:42,762
Oleg, talk to me. Come on.

1702
01:43:42,762 --> 01:43:45,486
OK, got to make it home now.
got to make it home.

1703
01:43:45,486 --> 01:43:46,951
Joey, please. You're bleeding.

1704
01:43:46,951 --> 01:43:48,456
I got some, see? I got some.

1705
01:43:48,456 --> 01:43:50,222
Come on! Fuck!

1706
01:43:51,506 --> 01:43:52,847
Fuck!

1707
01:43:52,847 --> 01:43:53,897
Look out!

1708
01:44:10,386 --> 01:44:12,491
Mr. Gazelle, stop the car.

1709
01:44:12,491 --> 01:44:13,806
We need to get some help.

1710
01:44:13,806 --> 01:44:15,183
Come on. Got to meet T.

1711
01:44:15,183 --> 01:44:17,257
- Please, Mr. Gazelle!
- I am coming home!

1712
01:44:33,585 --> 01:44:35,276
Mr. Gazelle, please,
stop the car.

1713
01:44:35,276 --> 01:44:36,457
We need to get some help.

1714
01:44:36,457 --> 01:44:39,082
- What's happened?
- You're hurt!

1715
01:44:39,082 --> 01:44:41,226
- We're going to make it home.
- Stop the car.

1716
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:44,393
You're bleeding!

1717
01:44:56,664 --> 01:44:58,104
God.

1718
01:44:58,544 --> 01:45:00,071
Oh, God.

1719
01:45:01,104 --> 01:45:03,471
Nicky, stay back, stay back!

1720
01:45:08,592 --> 01:45:09,836
Mila.

1721
01:45:09,836 --> 01:45:11,333
Joey!

1722
01:45:11,333 --> 01:45:14,605
Joey, please! Stop!

1723
01:45:14,605 --> 01:45:17,988
Mr. Gazelle, come on, wake up!

1724
01:45:22,383 --> 01:45:25,482
Mr. Gazelle, wake up! Come on!

1725
01:45:25,482 --> 01:45:27,592
Stop the car, stop the car!

1726
01:45:27,592 --> 01:45:28,908
Please! Stop!

1727
01:45:29,903 --> 01:45:30,918
Joe! Come on!

1728
01:45:30,918 --> 01:45:32,420
Something's wrong! Let's go!

1729
01:45:35,151 --> 01:45:36,151
Joe!

1730
01:45:39,982 --> 01:45:42,284
Oleg, wait, wait!

1731
01:45:42,284 --> 01:45:45,253
- God.
- Mom! Mom!

1732
01:45:45,253 --> 01:45:47,596
- Joe!
- Mom!

1733
01:45:50,619 --> 01:45:53,512
- Fuck!
- Nicky, call 911!

1734
01:45:54,975 --> 01:45:57,637
Don't do this to me, Joe.
Don't fucking do this to me.

1735
01:45:58,178 --> 01:45:59,139
Sweetheart...

1736
01:45:59,139 --> 01:46:01,287
I loved you, OK?

1737
01:46:01,287 --> 01:46:04,938
Just remember I was always
stuck with Joey. OK?

1738
01:46:04,938 --> 01:46:06,184
Only once did I lie.

1739
01:46:06,184 --> 01:46:08,523
Shut up, shut up.
Look at me, look at me.

1740
01:46:08,523 --> 01:46:11,525
Hey, baby, look me in the eye.
Joey, look me in the eyes.

1741
01:46:11,525 --> 01:46:13,507
I don't care, OK?
It doesn't matter.

1742
01:46:13,507 --> 01:46:15,622
Whatever it is, I am going to
kick your ass over it later.

1743
01:46:15,622 --> 01:46:17,188
Stay with me, Joe.
Stay--look at me.

1744
01:46:17,188 --> 01:46:19,433
Look at me. I am right here.
I am right here for you.

1745
01:46:19,433 --> 01:46:21,738
Nicky! Nicky, come here!

1746
01:46:21,738 --> 01:46:23,595
Nicky! Nicky!

1747
01:46:23,595 --> 01:46:24,807
He's right here.
He's right here.

1748
01:46:24,807 --> 01:46:25,860
They're coming.
They're on their way.

1749
01:46:25,860 --> 01:46:27,178
OK.

1750
01:46:27,178 --> 01:46:30,345
We're still going to the game
Friday night, right, Dad?

1751
01:46:30,345 --> 01:46:32,104
I love you, Nick!

1752
01:46:32,641 --> 01:46:35,108
OK, he wants--he wants
to go to the game, baby.

1753
01:46:35,108 --> 01:46:37,637
Yeah. We're going to
go to the game.

1754
01:46:37,637 --> 01:46:38,921
We're going to fucking
kick their asses, right, Mom?

1755
01:46:38,921 --> 01:46:41,956
They are going down
big fucking time!

1756
01:46:41,956 --> 01:46:43,851
You--you have a bad mouth.

1757
01:46:44,972 --> 01:46:46,314
Yep. Yep.

1758
01:46:48,460 --> 01:46:50,664
It's not that bad. You will be OK.

1759
01:46:50,664 --> 01:46:52,075
Joe.

1760
01:46:57,100 --> 01:46:58,474
I am right here.

1761
01:46:58,474 --> 01:47:01,191
I am right here. I am right here.

1762
01:47:02,796 --> 01:47:05,162
Joe. Joe!

1763
01:47:05,162 --> 01:47:06,887
Joe?

1764
01:47:06,887 --> 01:47:08,418
Joe. God, no, don't!

1765
01:47:12,064 --> 01:47:13,320
God, no!

1766
01:47:14,355 --> 01:47:16,322
God! Joe!

1767
01:47:22,123 --> 01:47:24,545
Keep the kid outside.
I don't want him going in there.

1768
01:47:27,371 --> 01:47:29,542
Keep that boy over there.
We got to move in.

1769
01:47:29,542 --> 01:47:32,066
This guy's CPT.
Come on, let's move.

1770
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:35,850
Subtitles: Arigon

1771
01:48:21,417 --> 01:48:22,661
Louise.

1772
01:48:22,897 --> 01:48:24,224
Louise.

1773
01:48:26,121 --> 01:48:28,390
Good girl. How's it going?

1774
01:48:30,725 --> 01:48:31,751
George...

1775
01:48:31,989 --> 01:48:33,350
the alternator's in the car.

1776
01:48:33,593 --> 01:48:34,649
All right.

1777
01:48:39,733 --> 01:48:42,466
Don't ever ask me
to bury you again, Joe.

1778
01:48:58,044 --> 01:48:59,332
Hey.

1779
01:48:59,668 --> 01:49:01,408
So, what did they put
in that coffin really?

1780
01:49:01,408 --> 01:49:02,430
What?

1781
01:49:02,430 --> 01:49:04,130
- What did they put in that coffin?
- What'd they put in the coffin?

1782
01:49:04,130 --> 01:49:05,150
Yeah.

1783
01:49:05,150 --> 01:49:07,363
- Why? Did it seem kind of heavy?
- Yeah!

1784
01:49:07,363 --> 01:49:10,629
I don't know. I am thinking...
probably a couple of blue shirts.

1785
01:49:10,629 --> 01:49:13,479
Must have been Lashaub and McCall.

1786
01:49:13,479 --> 01:49:15,519
- That sound good?
- And Cavin.

1787
01:49:15,519 --> 01:49:16,901
And Cavin?
You want some of this, too?

1788
01:49:16,901 --> 01:49:17,917
For sure, Marishka.

1789
01:49:17,917 --> 01:49:19,486
Marishka?
You want some of this, too?

1790
01:49:19,486 --> 01:49:20,856
I am going to check
the both of you right now...

1791
01:49:20,856 --> 01:49:22,461
right in this house.
How about that?

1792
01:49:22,703 --> 01:49:24,208
Grab his head.
