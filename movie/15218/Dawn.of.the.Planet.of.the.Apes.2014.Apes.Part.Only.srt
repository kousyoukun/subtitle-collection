1
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,627
Caesar...

2
00:04:00,891 --> 00:04:02,302
They are close.

3
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:06,838
Koba!

4
00:04:26,883 --> 00:04:28,920
Now, father?

5
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,957
Son, stay...

6
00:06:51,795 --> 00:06:54,036
Thank you, Koba.

7
00:07:15,885 --> 00:07:18,729
Think before you act, son.

8
00:08:23,286 --> 00:08:25,357
Don't feel bad, Blue Eyes...

9
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,796
Scars make you strong.

10
00:10:48,765 --> 00:10:51,905
Come meet your new brother.

11
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,294
Another son.

12
00:11:13,857 --> 00:11:17,999
Makes me think how far we've come,
Maurice.

13
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:24,978
Seems long ago.

14
00:11:28,571 --> 00:11:31,211
Still think about them?

15
00:11:32,075 --> 00:11:33,645
Humans?

16
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:38,081
Sometimes.

17
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,825
Didn't know them like you did.

18
00:11:44,988 --> 00:11:48,435
Only saw their bad side.

19
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:53,198
Good, bad... doesn't matter now.

20
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,004
Humans destroyed each other.

21
00:11:57,934 --> 00:11:59,914
Apes fight too.

22
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,843
But we are family.

23
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:12,957
Wonder if they're really all gone.

24
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,420
Ten winters now...

25
00:12:15,518 --> 00:12:19,193
Last two... no sign of them.

26
00:12:20,256 --> 00:12:22,236
They must be gone.

27
00:12:54,057 --> 00:12:56,970
That bear wouldn't get me Blue Eyes. I'm quick!

28
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,169
Shut up, Ash!

29
00:14:31,087 --> 00:14:34,000
They shot Ash! Shot my son!

30
00:14:34,857 --> 00:14:37,167
Rocket, wait...

31
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:11,191
Koba!

32
00:16:13,156 --> 00:16:14,362
Follow!

33
00:19:38,394 --> 00:19:40,032
Must attack them now!

34
00:19:40,329 --> 00:19:42,240
Before they attack us!

35
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:44,945
We don't know how many there are.

36
00:19:45,301 --> 00:19:47,440
How many guns they have?

37
00:19:48,504 --> 00:19:51,542
Or why they came up here?

38
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,458
They shot your son, Rocket!

39
00:20:01,984 --> 00:20:03,429
Don't you want to fight?

40
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,430
I follow Caesar.

41
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,960
Koba's right!

42
00:20:12,695 --> 00:20:14,936
They almost killed you, Ash!

43
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,887
If we go to war...

44
00:20:29,111 --> 00:20:32,718
We could lose all we've built...

45
00:20:57,306 --> 00:21:00,310
I will decide by morning.

46
00:21:19,395 --> 00:21:22,376
For years I was a prisoner in their lab...

47
00:21:22,898 --> 00:21:24,377
They cut me...

48
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:25,807
Tortured me.

49
00:21:28,003 --> 00:21:29,812
You freed me.

50
00:21:32,007 --> 00:21:34,112
I would do anything you ask.

51
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:38,988
But we must show strength!

52
00:21:41,517 --> 00:21:43,963
We will, Koba.

53
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:25,416
If they get power, they'll be more dangerous!

54
00:39:25,813 --> 00:39:27,417
Why help them?!

55
00:39:27,649 --> 00:39:29,754
They seem desperate...

56
00:39:30,518 --> 00:39:33,192
If we make them go, they'll attack.

57
00:39:35,657 --> 00:39:39,104
We'll destroy them while they're weak.

58
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:43,132
And how many apes will die?

59
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:48,739
We have one chance for peace...

60
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:52,285
Let them do their human work. Then they'll go.

61
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,106
Koba say...

62
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:51,469
Apes should hate humans...

63
00:40:51,633 --> 00:40:52,475
Enough!

64
00:40:53,001 --> 00:40:55,140
From humans Koba learned hate...

65
00:40:55,436 --> 00:40:57,074
But nothing else.

66
00:43:44,071 --> 00:43:48,213
You sound sick... You ok?

67
00:43:50,611 --> 00:43:52,318
Just need rest.

68
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:02,993
You worry about the humans...

69
00:45:03,184 --> 00:45:04,959
Where's Koba?

70
00:45:05,319 --> 00:45:08,857
Still angry.

71
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:13,534
Said he was going hunting...

72
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:23,206
Look, humans below!

73
00:45:36,417 --> 00:45:38,090
Why are we here?

74
00:45:38,619 --> 00:45:41,293
Caesar trusts humans...

75
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,893
Koba does not.

76
00:48:03,364 --> 00:48:05,810
Enough guns here to kill every ape...

77
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,301
Must warn Caesar.

78
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,612
Who knows what humans
are really doing up there?

79
00:56:23,564 --> 00:56:25,066
Father, no...!

80
00:56:37,911 --> 00:56:40,790
I will not help!

81
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:33,177
Just came from the city. Humans very dangerous!

82
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,611
Where is Caesar?

83
00:57:39,406 --> 00:57:42,250
With the humans...

84
01:01:25,532 --> 01:01:27,808
You are my son...

85
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:31,749
I need you to listen...

86
01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:47,530
You didn't tell Caesar about the guns we found?

87
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:52,827
Neither will you.

88
01:02:04,604 --> 01:02:08,643
Your father doesn't trust me now.

89
01:02:09,776 --> 01:02:12,620
You need to protect him.

90
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:15,721
His love for humans...

91
01:02:16,283 --> 01:02:18,126
Makes him blind.

92
01:02:18,251 --> 01:02:20,026
I know...

93
01:02:20,921 --> 01:02:24,926
As long as they are here...

94
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:30,808
I fear for Caesar's life.

95
01:10:35,748 --> 01:10:37,887
Feeling better?

96
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:17,793
Mother...?

97
01:12:28,694 --> 01:12:30,640
Human gun!

98
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:13,848
Go! Get them!

99
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:30,956
Females and young stay in woods...

100
01:13:30,957 --> 01:13:32,561
We go to the city!

101
01:13:41,334 --> 01:13:44,372
We will avenge your father's death!

102
01:23:17,643 --> 01:23:20,556
Humans escaping! Capture them!

103
01:26:23,795 --> 01:26:26,571
Followed the humans here. Hiding everywhere!

104
01:26:27,132 --> 01:26:29,669
We must catch them all!

105
01:26:56,328 --> 01:26:58,535
Go ahead Ash...

106
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:01,774
...make humans pay.

107
01:27:05,270 --> 01:27:08,581
Caesar wouldn't want this.

108
01:30:20,532 --> 01:30:22,512
Maurice...?

109
01:30:23,234 --> 01:30:25,180
Koba said...

110
01:30:25,870 --> 01:30:28,783
...we're too loyal to your father.

111
01:30:31,309 --> 01:30:34,916
Protect yourself.

112
01:34:05,557 --> 01:34:07,662
For now.

113
01:36:18,089 --> 01:36:20,160
I'm so sorry...

114
01:36:21,059 --> 01:36:22,663
For everything.

115
01:36:35,406 --> 01:36:37,613
But Koba betrayed you.

116
01:37:15,079 --> 01:37:17,389
On the human tower...

117
01:37:18,549 --> 01:37:20,688
Loyal apes around him.

118
01:37:24,822 --> 01:37:26,733
Prisoners.

119
01:37:28,059 --> 01:37:29,436
Maurice.

120
01:37:30,094 --> 01:37:31,505
Rocket.

121
01:37:35,767 --> 01:37:38,077
Koba killed Ash.

122
01:37:44,509 --> 01:37:46,580
Fear makes others follow.

123
01:37:49,113 --> 01:37:50,888
But when they see you alive...

124
01:37:52,450 --> 01:37:55,431
They will turn from Koba.

125
01:43:55,379 --> 01:43:58,622
Koba sent for the females and young.

126
01:43:58,816 --> 01:44:01,353
They're on their way.

127
01:44:01,685 --> 01:44:03,130
Mother too.
