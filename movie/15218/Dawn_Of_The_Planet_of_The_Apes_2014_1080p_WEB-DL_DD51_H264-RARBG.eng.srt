1
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,440
If you have a fever and cough
or sore throat...

2
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,059
Stay home.

3
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:07,276
I'd say 95% chance this is manufactured.
Came out of a laboratory.

4
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,147
The source of the virus was traced back...

5
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:12,614
To drug testing done at
gen-sys laboratories in San Francisco.

6
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:14,986
The lab technician now known
as patient zero...

7
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:18,913
Was accidentally exposed to
retrovirus alz-113....

8
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:21,794
An Alzheimer's trial drug
that was being tested on chimpanzees.

9
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:25,132
The infected chimps showed signs
of erratic and aggressive behavior...

10
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:27,089
That led to their escape from the facility.

11
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:29,459
The now-famous incident
on the golden gate bridge...

12
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,506
A six-hour standoff with police...

13
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,180
Ended with the apes disappearing
into muir woods.

14
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:37,929
Emergency rooms are being overwhelmed
with patients showing signs...

15
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:39,853
Of what's being dubbed
"the simian flu."

16
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:42,192
The CDC is projecting a fatality toll...

17
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,687
Ranging from 5 million
to as many as 150 million...

18
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,111
In the next 6 to 8 months.

19
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:51,649
Anyone showing signs of a contagious illness
will receive special treatment here...

20
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:54,275
The airport's purpose-built
quarantine center.

21
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:58,373
Many of the new arrivals are children
who have lost contact with their parents.

22
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,000
The mandatory quarantines
have sparked civil unrest.

23
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:03,038
Families are being ripped apart.

24
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,711
Containment is not very likely.

25
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,500
Prepare your families.
Know your evacuation route.

26
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:11,054
The survival rate is now
approximately 1 in 500.

27
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,299
Violence erupted in the city center tonight.

28
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:14,802
The third incident in as many days.

29
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,353
Martial law has been declared in 28 nations...

30
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,217
Including the U.S. and Canada.

31
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,774
The reactor is overheating.
We can't stop a meltdown.

32
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:26,899
Just a total collapse of anything
resembling civilian order.

33
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:29,519
Due to the extremity of the
simian flu crisis...

34
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:33,276
All regular government functions
have been suspended indefinitely.

35
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,575
Those who aren't killed by the virus...

36
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,447
Will probably die in the fighting.

37
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:44,828
So, maybe this is it.

38
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,043
This is how it ends.

39
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,594
Pretty soon...

40
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,765
There won't be anyone left.

41
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,534
Caesar...

42
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,202
They are close.

43
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,738
Koba!

44
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,846
Now, father?

45
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,915
Son, stay...

46
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,003
Thank you, koba.

47
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:16,691
Think before you act, son.

48
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,291
Don't feel bad, blue eyes...

49
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:29,755
Scars make you strong.

50
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,860
Come meet your new brother.

51
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,254
Another son.

52
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:15,927
Makes me think how far we've come,
Maurice.

53
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:22,931
Seems long ago.

54
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,150
Still think about them?

55
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,613
Humans?

56
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,028
Sometimes.

57
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:41,794
Didn't know them like you did.

58
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:46,373
Only saw their bad side.

59
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:51,132
Good, bad... doesn't matter now.

60
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,964
Humans destroyed each other.

61
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:57,843
Apes fight too.

62
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,795
But we are family.

63
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:10,902
Wonder if they're really all gone.

64
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,443
Ten winters now...

65
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:17,153
Last two... no sign of them.

66
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:20,157
They must be gone.

67
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:54,902
That bear wouldn't get me blue eyes. I'm quick!

68
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:57,107
Shut up, ash!

69
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:09,575
Oh, God.

70
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,463
It's okay.

71
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:25,183
It's okay. It's okay.

72
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:26,392
Freeze!

73
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:42,858
Stay!

74
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:44,156
Help!

75
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:46,455
Help!

76
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:47,493
No!

77
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:49,832
Hey!

78
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,424
Over here!

79
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:57,248
I shot him! I shot him.

80
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:31,956
They shot ash! Shot my son!

81
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,129
Rocket, wait...

82
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,219
We don't mean any harm!

83
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:47,138
They're apes, man. You think
they understand what you're saying?

84
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,138
Do they look like just apes to you?

85
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,780
Dad.

86
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:05,781
Malcolm, what are you doing?

87
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,202
-Dad?
-Malcolm.

88
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:08,321
It's okay.

89
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:15,464
Put your guns down.

90
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:17,329
-You can't be serious.
-Do it.

91
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,177
Go!

92
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,218
Holy shit.

93
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:32,275
Holy shit.

94
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:37,482
Okay. Okay, we're going.

95
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:38,981
Go!

96
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:40,652
Slowly.
Go, go, go!

97
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:46,242
My bag!

98
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,280
Go!

99
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:09,138
Koba!

100
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:12,306
Follow!

101
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,311
Did you find it?

102
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,767
We need to talk.

103
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,822
What? What's wrong?

104
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:08,237
The dam is pretty much intact.

105
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:10,198
It could probably start generating
power for us within a week.

106
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,777
But there is a problem. Get in.

107
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:25,548
I shot him.

108
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:27,671
I was scared.
I didn't know what to do.

109
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:30,844
Jesus Christ.
How many were there?

110
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:32,094
A lot. Like, 80.

111
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:33,425
-At least.
-Okay...

112
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:37,350
You're not hearing what he's saying.
They spoke!

113
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:38,931
That is not possible.

114
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:40,976
I'm telling you, Dreyfus,
they did and it was incredible.

115
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:43,859
Incredible? They're talking apes!

116
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,017
-With big-ass Spears!
-Please!

117
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:49,856
I don't know exactly what you think
you saw or heard...

118
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:52,531
But you have to calm down, okay?

119
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:55,955
What about the virus, Ellie?
Any chance of contagion?

120
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:59,293
We're all genetically immune
or we would've been dead a long time ago.

121
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:00,659
You don't know that for sure.

122
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:02,116
She worked with the CDC.
She knows.

123
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:03,115
What are we gonna do?

124
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:04,827
I don't know.

125
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:06,999
We need that power.

126
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:09,125
He could've killed us, but he didn't.

127
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:11,843
Maybe he kept us alive,
so they could follow us.

128
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:14,974
They find out where we are,
and they kill us all!

129
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:16,352
What do you mean, "he"?

130
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:18,138
That's what we're trying to tell you.

131
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:21,022
It was unlike anything you've
ever seen before, and the leader...

132
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:23,647
He was remarkable.

133
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:24,896
Really?

134
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:27,154
-Is that what you thought?
-It's what we saw.

135
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:28,481
Yeah, it's what we all saw.

136
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:30,935
Not a word of this back at the colony,
you understand me?

137
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:32,856
Not a word
until we can figure out what to do.

138
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:35,415
-You gotta be kidding.
-No, I'm not kidding.

139
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:38,912
I don't want to create a panic.

140
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:59,387
How are you doing, pal?
Are you okay?

141
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:01,683
-I dropped my bag.
-I know.

142
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:03,725
-Was your sketchbook in there?
-It's gone.

143
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:07,229
Carver just told me we're not gonna tell
anybody what happened up there.

144
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:08,942
Not yet. No.

145
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:37,931
Must attack them now!

146
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:40,142
Before they attack us!

147
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:42,849
We don't know how many there are.

148
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:45,355
How many guns they have?

149
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:49,436
Or why they came up here?

150
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,370
They shot your son, rocket!

151
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:01,328
Don't you want to fight?

152
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:05,326
I follow Caesar.

153
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:08,884
Koba's right!

154
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:12,837
They almost killed you, ash!

155
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:19,259
No!

156
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:26,981
If we go to war...

157
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:30,649
We could lose all we've built...

158
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:34,396
Home.

159
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:38,994
Family.

160
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:48,617
Future.

161
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:58,224
I will decide by morning.

162
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:10,811
Caesar.

163
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:20,279
For years I was a prisoner in their lab...

164
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:22,452
They cut me...

165
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:23,701
Tortured me.

166
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:27,701
You freed me.

167
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:32,045
I would do anything you ask.

168
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:36,877
But we must show strength!

169
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:41,894
We will, koba.

170
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:26,888
Coming through. Coming through.

171
00:22:47,451 --> 00:22:50,291
That's a hell of a lot more than eighty!

172
00:23:18,357 --> 00:23:20,147
Malcolm!

173
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:52,718
Apes...

174
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,690
Do not want war...

175
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:02,686
But will fight...

176
00:24:03,694 --> 00:24:06,824
If we must.

177
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:41,612
Ape home.

178
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:47,396
Human home.

179
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:55,197
Do not come back.

180
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:36,453
Everyone!

181
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:41,119
Everyone, you have to calm down!

182
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,800
Everybody.

183
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:52,587
Everybody!

184
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:56,426
Please! We're all immune!

185
00:25:56,473 --> 00:26:00,983
We're all immune,
or we wouldn't still be here!

186
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:02,479
How did they find us?

187
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:05,071
We found them.

188
00:26:05,107 --> 00:26:07,607
-You knew they were out there!
-What if they come back?

189
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:09,571
Yeah!

190
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:12,411
If they come back--
if they come back...

191
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:15,487
They'll be sorry they ever did!

192
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,749
Now, this city may not have the
manpower it once did...

193
00:26:18,787 --> 00:26:21,657
But it has the firepower.

194
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:24,422
Those stockpiles left behind...

195
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:29,169
By fema, the national guard,
we have it all.

196
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:31,014
Look...

197
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:35,014
I know why you're scared.

198
00:26:35,846 --> 00:26:39,516
I'm scared, too, believe me.

199
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:43,398
But I recognize the trust
you've all placed in me.

200
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:46,857
We've been through hell together.

201
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:52,358
But you all know
what we're up against.

202
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:58,122
We're almost out of fuel.

203
00:26:58,911 --> 00:27:01,501
Which means no more power...

204
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:05,168
Which means we could slip back
to the way things were.

205
00:27:05,209 --> 00:27:09,209
That dam up there was the answer.

206
00:27:10,547 --> 00:27:13,427
We just had no idea
they were up there, too.

207
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:14,507
So, what do we do now?

208
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:16,851
Yeah!

209
00:27:16,887 --> 00:27:19,717
We find another way...

210
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:23,686
Because that power...

211
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:25,397
Is not just about keeping the lights on.

212
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:28,229
It's about giving us the tools...

213
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:30,733
To reconnect to the rest of the world.

214
00:27:30,776 --> 00:27:33,776
To find out who else is out there...

215
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:38,070
So that we can start to rebuild...

216
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,830
And reclaim...

217
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:47,504
The world we lost.

218
00:27:51,255 --> 00:27:53,805
That was a great speech.

219
00:27:55,926 --> 00:27:58,846
There is no alternative power source.

220
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:02,970
That dam is the only option.

221
00:28:07,688 --> 00:28:10,358
Well, then, we fight them.

222
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:16,449
We're two weeks away
from running out of fuel.

223
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:17,658
Maybe three, tops.

224
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:18,908
I know.

225
00:28:18,949 --> 00:28:21,239
And once that happens...

226
00:28:21,285 --> 00:28:23,875
I won't be able to go out
there with a bullhorn...

227
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:26,331
And calm everybody down.

228
00:28:26,874 --> 00:28:30,924
We need that power
to get the radio transmitter working.

229
00:28:30,961 --> 00:28:34,381
It's our only chance
of reaching the outside world.

230
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:36,631
We have to find other survivors.

231
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:39,675
Yeah. There's not that many of us left.

232
00:28:40,554 --> 00:28:42,604
We can't afford any more casualties.

233
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:45,309
We founded this place...

234
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:47,809
-You and I...
-I know.

235
00:28:48,187 --> 00:28:51,977
On the idea that power would lead us back
to the life we once had.

236
00:28:52,566 --> 00:28:54,726
If we can't stick together,
maybe we can't survive.

237
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:57,319
I lost everything.

238
00:28:58,864 --> 00:29:02,834
The idea of losing what little I have is...

239
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:07,002
I want to go back up there.

240
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:11,996
Listen to me. Give me three days.

241
00:29:12,044 --> 00:29:14,054
Let me talk to him.
If it doesn't work, then we do it your way.

242
00:29:14,421 --> 00:29:16,631
And what if it backfires?
What if he gets violent?

243
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:20,393
I mean, how do you know
that he'll even understand you?

244
00:29:24,014 --> 00:29:26,434
He's more than just an ape.

245
00:29:28,352 --> 00:29:30,982
I'm gonna take some men
up to fort point.

246
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:32,901
I'm gonna go through the armory.

247
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:35,725
I'm gonna see what's still working.

248
00:29:37,027 --> 00:29:38,397
Three days.

249
00:29:38,445 --> 00:29:39,815
You're not back in three days...

250
00:29:39,863 --> 00:29:43,373
We're going up there,
and we're gonna kill every last one of them.

251
00:29:59,508 --> 00:30:02,138
Carver is getting the trucks ready.

252
00:30:02,177 --> 00:30:04,887
He'll be here with foster and kemp
any minute.

253
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:08,639
You're really taking carver?
I mean, he shot one of them.

254
00:30:08,684 --> 00:30:10,064
I don't really have any choice.

255
00:30:10,102 --> 00:30:14,942
He used to work at the water department.
He's the only one who knows how the dam works.

256
00:30:16,567 --> 00:30:18,027
Malcolm...

257
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:21,648
What are you gonna do up there?
What are you gonna say?

258
00:30:23,532 --> 00:30:25,832
I'll tell him the truth.

259
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:28,831
Hope I catch him in a good mood.

260
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:36,041
You think I'm crazy.

261
00:30:37,129 --> 00:30:38,879
I'm worried.

262
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:41,801
Yeah, so am I.

263
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:45,261
I've gone over it in my head...

264
00:30:46,513 --> 00:30:49,603
And I think if I don't at least try this...

265
00:30:50,893 --> 00:30:52,983
There's gonna be a war.

266
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:16,457
Take me with you.

267
00:31:16,502 --> 00:31:18,802
What if someone gets hurt?
You'll need me there.

268
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:24,299
I love you.

269
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:27,599
But I need you to stay here.

270
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:31,059
I don't want Alexander to be alone.

271
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:33,349
I'm coming, too.

272
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,310
Son, it's not safe.

273
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:41,691
But I'm safer with you
than I am down here.

274
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:44,491
I'm coming.

275
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:45,820
Please.

276
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,480
No one gets out of the trucks.

277
00:32:16,812 --> 00:32:18,402
No one.

278
00:32:18,856 --> 00:32:22,356
If I'm not back in two hours,
you get everyone back to the city.

279
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:25,110
It's gonna be okay.

280
00:35:27,294 --> 00:35:30,304
Please. Please. Please.

281
00:35:33,592 --> 00:35:35,222
Please don't kill me.

282
00:35:35,802 --> 00:35:38,722
Just hear what I have to say.

283
00:35:39,681 --> 00:35:41,101
I know.

284
00:35:42,935 --> 00:35:46,105
"Don't come back." I know.

285
00:35:46,563 --> 00:35:48,443
I wouldn't be here unless it were--

286
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:50,282
okay! Okay! Okay!

287
00:35:54,029 --> 00:35:57,119
Okay, okay, okay.

288
00:35:58,617 --> 00:36:01,537
I need to show you something.

289
00:36:01,578 --> 00:36:02,788
It's not far.

290
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:04,249
Human lies!

291
00:36:04,498 --> 00:36:06,748
No! No!

292
00:36:08,961 --> 00:36:11,051
No, no, no. I swear.

293
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:17,050
If I could just show you,
then you'll understand.

294
00:36:17,094 --> 00:36:18,644
Please.

295
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:41,579
Show me.

296
00:37:04,683 --> 00:37:08,523
This is what we used to call
a "small hydro."

297
00:37:08,562 --> 00:37:11,442
It was built to service
areas to the north of here...

298
00:37:11,481 --> 00:37:14,781
But we've been working to
reroute the power lines to the city...

299
00:37:14,818 --> 00:37:17,528
Because the city used to run off nuclear power,
but that ran out years ago.

300
00:37:17,571 --> 00:37:20,121
So, we've been using
diesel generators and gasifiers.

301
00:37:20,157 --> 00:37:23,027
But if we can just
get this dam working...

302
00:37:23,076 --> 00:37:27,366
Then we have a shot
at restoring limited power.

303
00:37:34,505 --> 00:37:37,425
Is any of this making any sense to you?

304
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:41,550
The... lights.

305
00:37:41,595 --> 00:37:43,355
Yes.

306
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:45,521
The lights.

307
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,520
This is your home...

308
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,350
And I don't want to take it away from you,
I promise.

309
00:37:51,396 --> 00:37:56,106
But if you can let us do our work here--

310
00:37:56,151 --> 00:37:58,031
you brought others?

311
00:38:02,366 --> 00:38:03,736
Just a few.

312
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:06,661
I'm not a threat.

313
00:38:06,703 --> 00:38:08,163
If I am...

314
00:38:08,872 --> 00:38:11,582
Then I guess you can kill me.

315
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,900
Come on!

316
00:38:39,945 --> 00:38:43,075
-Wait, wait, wait!
-Stop, stop.

317
00:38:55,169 --> 00:38:56,749
We need to give them our guns.

318
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:00,915
That's the one condition.

319
00:39:01,508 --> 00:39:02,588
What does that mean?

320
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:05,390
We can stay.

321
00:39:20,235 --> 00:39:23,315
If they get power, they'll be more dangerous!

322
00:39:23,739 --> 00:39:25,319
Why help them?!

323
00:39:25,574 --> 00:39:27,664
They seem desperate...

324
00:39:28,452 --> 00:39:31,122
If we make them go, they'll attack.

325
00:39:31,455 --> 00:39:33,545
Let them.

326
00:39:33,582 --> 00:39:37,002
We'll destroy them while they're weak.

327
00:39:38,045 --> 00:39:41,055
And how many apes will die?

328
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:46,640
We have one chance for peace...

329
00:39:47,221 --> 00:39:50,181
Let them do their human work. Then they'll go.

330
00:39:52,434 --> 00:39:54,314
Human work?

331
00:39:57,397 --> 00:39:59,897
Human work.

332
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:04,990
Human work.

333
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:07,279
Human work!

334
00:40:45,612 --> 00:40:47,032
Koba say...

335
00:40:47,281 --> 00:40:49,491
Apes should hate humans...

336
00:40:49,533 --> 00:40:50,373
Enough!

337
00:40:50,909 --> 00:40:53,039
From humans koba learned hate...

338
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:55,000
But nothing else.

339
00:41:09,011 --> 00:41:10,511
Hey.

340
00:41:10,846 --> 00:41:12,006
You need to eat.

341
00:41:12,848 --> 00:41:14,718
Okay.

342
00:41:14,975 --> 00:41:17,065
That was brave, what you did today.

343
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:26,949
Malcolm.

344
00:41:27,237 --> 00:41:28,907
I know everyone's depending on you--

345
00:41:28,947 --> 00:41:32,617
I don't care about that.
I don't care about any of that.

346
00:41:33,535 --> 00:41:34,785
I care about him.

347
00:41:36,788 --> 00:41:40,958
He saw things that no kid should see,
and I'm not letting us go back to that.

348
00:41:45,714 --> 00:41:47,594
I know.

349
00:41:57,434 --> 00:41:59,984
I have been trying
to get closer to him.

350
00:42:00,604 --> 00:42:02,064
But...

351
00:42:02,814 --> 00:42:04,154
You will.

352
00:42:08,862 --> 00:42:12,032
You know the scary thing about them?

353
00:42:12,074 --> 00:42:15,334
They don't need power, lights.

354
00:42:16,286 --> 00:42:19,156
Heat. Nothing.

355
00:42:19,206 --> 00:42:20,036
Hey, pal.

356
00:42:20,082 --> 00:42:21,622
That's their advantage.

357
00:42:22,584 --> 00:42:25,214
That's what makes them stronger.

358
00:42:25,254 --> 00:42:28,054
Malcolm, I'm thinking one of us
should stand guard tonight.

359
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:30,300
With what? They took our guns.

360
00:42:30,342 --> 00:42:31,842
If they wanted us dead,
we would be dead already.

361
00:42:31,885 --> 00:42:34,295
Maybe they're just taking their time.

362
00:42:34,346 --> 00:42:35,676
They killed off half the planet already.

363
00:42:36,348 --> 00:42:37,308
Come on.

364
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:38,429
What?

365
00:42:38,475 --> 00:42:40,265
You can't honestly blame the apes.

366
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:44,060
Who the hell else am I going to blame?
It was the simian flu.

367
00:42:44,106 --> 00:42:45,976
It was a virus created
by scientists in a lab.

368
00:42:46,024 --> 00:42:48,784
The chimps they were testing on
didn't have a say in the matter.

369
00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:50,649
Spare me the hippie-dippie bullshit.

370
00:42:50,696 --> 00:42:53,866
You're telling me you don't get
sick to your stomach at the sight of them?

371
00:42:58,036 --> 00:42:59,446
Didn't you have a little girl?

372
00:42:59,496 --> 00:43:00,496
Carver, that's enough.

373
00:43:00,539 --> 00:43:02,329
-How did she die?
-That's enough!

374
00:43:02,374 --> 00:43:03,384
Or your wife, for that matter.

375
00:43:03,417 --> 00:43:04,627
Carver, you better shut up...

376
00:43:04,668 --> 00:43:06,588
Before I kick your ass.

377
00:43:10,048 --> 00:43:11,168
Okay.

378
00:43:13,969 --> 00:43:16,599
I'm the asshole.

379
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:23,400
Are you okay?

380
00:43:41,997 --> 00:43:46,127
You sound sick... you ok?

381
00:43:48,545 --> 00:43:50,205
Just need rest.

382
00:43:57,346 --> 00:44:00,886
You worry about the humans...

383
00:45:01,118 --> 00:45:02,868
Where's koba?

384
00:45:03,245 --> 00:45:06,795
Still angry.

385
00:45:08,208 --> 00:45:11,458
Said he was going hunting...

386
00:45:19,052 --> 00:45:21,142
Look, humans below!

387
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:35,988
Why are we here?

388
00:45:36,528 --> 00:45:39,198
Caesar trusts humans...

389
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:41,830
Koba does not.

390
00:45:43,368 --> 00:45:45,328
Most of the arsenal seems functional.

391
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:46,290
Good.

392
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:48,000
We're testing them out back.

393
00:46:35,254 --> 00:46:36,884
Hey!

394
00:46:37,923 --> 00:46:39,263
Don't you move!

395
00:46:39,299 --> 00:46:42,299
Don't move, do you understand me?

396
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:44,550
Terry!

397
00:46:44,972 --> 00:46:47,392
Terry, get in here, quick!

398
00:46:54,022 --> 00:46:56,152
Holy shit.

399
00:46:58,777 --> 00:47:01,817
What do we do?
What do we do?

400
00:47:01,864 --> 00:47:03,284
Where did he come from?

401
00:47:04,032 --> 00:47:06,582
-Should we shoot him?
-Maybe. I don't know.

402
00:47:10,455 --> 00:47:13,075
You are one ugly son of a bitch,
aren't you?

403
00:47:31,935 --> 00:47:34,055
Whoa, man.

404
00:47:38,609 --> 00:47:40,239
Dude, I think he's hungry.

405
00:47:40,277 --> 00:47:42,737
He must have gotten separated
from the others.

406
00:47:42,779 --> 00:47:43,859
You lost?

407
00:47:44,615 --> 00:47:46,955
Trying to get home?

408
00:47:47,784 --> 00:47:50,584
Go on! Get out of here, stupid monkey!

409
00:47:50,621 --> 00:47:53,371
Go on. You heard him. Go!

410
00:48:01,298 --> 00:48:03,718
Enough guns here to kill every ape...

411
00:48:04,635 --> 00:48:06,185
Must warn Caesar.

412
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:08,510
Who knows what humans are really doing up there?

413
00:48:28,158 --> 00:48:30,788
We gotta clear this blockage.

414
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:37,671
I didn't know you had a daughter.

415
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,340
Yeah.

416
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,140
What was her name?

417
00:48:56,186 --> 00:48:58,186
Sarah.

418
00:49:02,693 --> 00:49:04,533
I'm really sorry.

419
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:15,499
Well, now I have you and your dad, so...

420
00:49:22,254 --> 00:49:24,424
Yeah.

421
00:49:24,464 --> 00:49:26,384
All right, you got that straight?

422
00:49:36,393 --> 00:49:38,193
Whoa.

423
00:49:38,228 --> 00:49:40,188
That's all the wire we got.

424
00:49:40,814 --> 00:49:43,024
Brace yourselves.

425
00:49:44,151 --> 00:49:48,321
Three, two, one.

426
00:49:53,994 --> 00:49:56,334
-Dad!
-Malcolm!

427
00:50:01,043 --> 00:50:03,803
Malcolm! Malcolm!

428
00:50:03,837 --> 00:50:04,667
Dad?

429
00:50:05,422 --> 00:50:06,672
I can't see carver.

430
00:50:30,572 --> 00:50:31,872
Don't!

431
00:50:31,907 --> 00:50:33,907
-Leave it there.
-I got it.

432
00:50:36,328 --> 00:50:38,408
It's not broken.

433
00:50:39,498 --> 00:50:42,328
Let go. Good.

434
00:50:54,263 --> 00:50:55,813
Thank you.

435
00:50:57,307 --> 00:50:58,807
You saved our lives.

436
00:50:59,434 --> 00:51:00,894
We've got a lot of debris to clear now.

437
00:51:00,936 --> 00:51:02,096
We might need a bit more time.

438
00:51:02,145 --> 00:51:03,975
How long?

439
00:51:42,269 --> 00:51:43,439
Hey, buddy.

440
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,860
Hey... hey...

441
00:51:52,362 --> 00:51:54,612
What are you doing? Are you finished?

442
00:51:57,451 --> 00:51:58,581
What are you looking at?

443
00:52:07,377 --> 00:52:08,747
Hey! Hey!

444
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:11,590
Hey, get out of there!

445
00:52:16,887 --> 00:52:19,177
-Hey! I'll kill you!
-Carver, what're you doing?

446
00:52:23,894 --> 00:52:25,274
Don't! Don't!

447
00:52:25,312 --> 00:52:27,152
Caesar, no!

448
00:52:27,189 --> 00:52:28,399
No.

449
00:52:42,913 --> 00:52:47,463
Said no guns!

450
00:52:51,088 --> 00:52:52,628
-No, don't.
-Please.

451
00:53:24,454 --> 00:53:26,334
I didn't know.

452
00:53:33,338 --> 00:53:36,798
Human leave now!

453
00:54:21,595 --> 00:54:23,265
Man, we screwed now.

454
00:54:26,892 --> 00:54:28,272
Malcolm?

455
00:54:29,019 --> 00:54:31,149
Malcolm, where are you going?

456
00:54:31,188 --> 00:54:32,018
Malcolm.

457
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:41,070
Please, please,
I just need to speak to him.

458
00:54:44,076 --> 00:54:47,366
I'm sorry. That was all my fault.
But I will make him leave.

459
00:54:47,788 --> 00:54:50,618
This my home.

460
00:54:52,292 --> 00:54:54,042
You should not be here.

461
00:54:54,419 --> 00:54:55,879
I understand.

462
00:54:55,921 --> 00:54:57,921
Malcolm.

463
00:55:02,636 --> 00:55:04,046
She's sick.

464
00:55:06,223 --> 00:55:08,313
How long has she been this way?

465
00:55:15,983 --> 00:55:18,073
I have medicine.

466
00:55:19,069 --> 00:55:20,989
Antibiotics.

467
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,410
Maybe she can help.

468
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:30,660
Do not trust you.

469
00:55:32,916 --> 00:55:34,996
I don't blame you.

470
00:55:35,502 --> 00:55:37,882
But believe me...

471
00:55:37,921 --> 00:55:39,711
We are not all like him.

472
00:55:39,756 --> 00:55:41,256
Please.

473
00:55:42,759 --> 00:55:44,929
Let us help you.

474
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:15,291
One day.

475
00:56:17,503 --> 00:56:20,673
You stay one day.

476
00:56:21,507 --> 00:56:23,007
Father, no...!

477
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:25,680
-We might need more time.
-One day!

478
00:56:30,098 --> 00:56:32,138
Ape will help.

479
00:56:35,854 --> 00:56:38,734
I will not help!

480
00:56:42,194 --> 00:56:43,864
-This is bullshit, man!
-Get him out of here.

481
00:56:44,154 --> 00:56:46,954
Move! That's enough.
Come on, get out of here.

482
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:48,740
Come on, man.

483
00:56:54,831 --> 00:56:56,001
Okay?

484
00:56:57,584 --> 00:56:59,884
Move, come on!

485
00:57:04,508 --> 00:57:06,048
Get in!

486
00:57:21,024 --> 00:57:23,154
See you tomorrow, asshole.

487
00:57:28,198 --> 00:57:31,118
Just came from the city. Humans very dangerous!

488
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:33,540
Where is Caesar?

489
00:57:37,374 --> 00:57:40,214
With the humans...

490
00:57:45,507 --> 00:57:47,007
Yo, Alex.

491
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:50,260
This relay's busted.
See if there's another one.

492
00:57:50,304 --> 00:57:51,264
Yeah.

493
00:58:12,784 --> 00:58:14,664
Caesar.

494
00:58:20,375 --> 00:58:21,285
Hey!

495
00:58:24,213 --> 00:58:25,843
No! No, no, no, don't!

496
00:58:25,881 --> 00:58:27,381
No! No! No!

497
00:58:34,515 --> 00:58:38,025
Where Caesar? Want Caesar.

498
00:58:38,352 --> 00:58:40,152
Caesar!

499
00:58:56,328 --> 00:59:00,618
Humans attack your sons.

500
00:59:00,666 --> 00:59:04,586
You let them stay!

501
00:59:06,505 --> 00:59:09,725
Put apes in danger!

502
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:15,930
Caesar love humans more...

503
00:59:15,973 --> 00:59:17,353
Than apes!

504
00:59:18,851 --> 00:59:22,151
More than your...

505
00:59:22,187 --> 00:59:24,147
Sons.

506
01:00:11,195 --> 01:00:12,655
Ape...

507
01:00:13,655 --> 01:00:15,445
Not...

508
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:17,330
Kill...

509
01:00:17,367 --> 01:00:19,037
Ape.

510
01:00:47,356 --> 01:00:49,396
Forgive me.

511
01:01:23,475 --> 01:01:25,765
You are my son...

512
01:01:27,229 --> 01:01:29,689
I need you to listen...

513
01:01:41,618 --> 01:01:45,458
You didn't tell Caesar about the guns we found?

514
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:50,790
Neither will you.

515
01:02:02,556 --> 01:02:06,596
Your father doesn't trust me now.

516
01:02:07,728 --> 01:02:10,558
You need to protect him.

517
01:02:10,939 --> 01:02:13,649
His love for humans...

518
01:02:14,234 --> 01:02:16,154
Makes him blind.

519
01:02:16,195 --> 01:02:17,995
I know...

520
01:02:18,864 --> 01:02:22,874
As long as they are here...

521
01:02:24,828 --> 01:02:28,748
I fear for Caesar's life.

522
01:03:19,132 --> 01:03:20,222
For yesterday.

523
01:03:44,741 --> 01:03:47,121
Look. Look.

524
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,160
Watch.

525
01:03:48,579 --> 01:03:50,499
Watch.

526
01:03:50,539 --> 01:03:52,249
"It was Friday.

527
01:03:53,167 --> 01:03:55,377
"A real nice afternoon.

528
01:03:56,003 --> 01:03:57,593
"Warm.

529
01:04:00,924 --> 01:04:03,054
"We were hanging...

530
01:04:03,886 --> 01:04:06,296
"We were hanging out...

531
01:04:06,346 --> 01:04:09,096
"At this kegger down
at the swimming hole."

532
01:04:11,268 --> 01:04:13,018
Hanging out.

533
01:04:15,522 --> 01:04:17,442
Hanging.

534
01:04:19,067 --> 01:04:21,897
Here. You can read?

535
01:04:32,122 --> 01:04:34,122
Now, this is the good stuff.

536
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:38,750
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

537
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:49,260
What the hell is wrong with you?
I thought we told you to go home!

538
01:04:49,765 --> 01:04:51,315
No!

539
01:04:51,350 --> 01:04:53,890
No! Go!

540
01:04:57,231 --> 01:04:58,691
-He understood that, didn't he?
-Yeah.

541
01:05:00,067 --> 01:05:01,937
Hey, hey, hey!

542
01:05:01,985 --> 01:05:03,485
Hey, hey.

543
01:05:08,075 --> 01:05:08,875
Hey.

544
01:05:08,909 --> 01:05:11,909
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Hey, hey, hey.

545
01:05:14,623 --> 01:05:16,123
I think he likes you.

546
01:05:16,166 --> 01:05:17,706
Shut up.

547
01:05:17,751 --> 01:05:19,501
All right, all right.

548
01:05:20,504 --> 01:05:23,514
You want a drink, fugly?

549
01:05:23,549 --> 01:05:25,759
Go on, give him some.

550
01:05:25,801 --> 01:05:28,221
Give him some, man.
See what happens.

551
01:05:31,223 --> 01:05:32,103
There you go.

552
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:33,890
Whoa, hey!

553
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:37,810
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

554
01:05:39,147 --> 01:05:40,147
Shit!

555
01:05:45,112 --> 01:05:46,202
That's good, huh?

556
01:05:48,407 --> 01:05:50,027
Hey, hey, hey!

557
01:05:50,075 --> 01:05:51,735
Okay. All right.

558
01:05:53,161 --> 01:05:53,951
Easy.

559
01:05:53,996 --> 01:05:54,826
Yeah.

560
01:05:54,872 --> 01:05:56,122
-Easy.
-Easy.

561
01:05:56,164 --> 01:05:57,174
All right--

562
01:06:45,964 --> 01:06:47,764
Malcolm!

563
01:06:47,799 --> 01:06:49,089
Malcolm!

564
01:06:49,134 --> 01:06:51,684
What is it? What happened?

565
01:08:29,109 --> 01:08:30,739
It worked.

566
01:08:31,862 --> 01:08:33,862
At least here it did.

567
01:08:33,906 --> 01:08:36,696
We'll know when
we get back to the city.

568
01:08:43,498 --> 01:08:44,708
Trust.

569
01:09:10,192 --> 01:09:12,402
Son of a bitch.

570
01:09:12,861 --> 01:09:15,661
You son of a bitch!

571
01:10:01,326 --> 01:10:04,156
The... lights.

572
01:10:33,692 --> 01:10:35,822
Feeling better?

573
01:11:12,648 --> 01:11:15,728
Mother...?

574
01:12:26,638 --> 01:12:28,598
Human gun!

575
01:12:31,894 --> 01:12:33,274
Run.

576
01:12:47,618 --> 01:12:51,248
Humans kill Caesar!

577
01:12:55,959 --> 01:12:57,919
Burn ape home!

578
01:13:09,932 --> 01:13:11,812
Go! Get them!

579
01:13:12,267 --> 01:13:15,937
Apes must attack human city!

580
01:13:16,647 --> 01:13:18,767
Fight back!

581
01:13:19,191 --> 01:13:22,941
Come, fight for Caesar!

582
01:13:26,782 --> 01:13:28,872
Females and young stay in woods...

583
01:13:28,909 --> 01:13:30,489
We go to the city!

584
01:13:39,294 --> 01:13:42,344
We will avenge your father's death!

585
01:13:56,311 --> 01:13:58,361
Ellie! Ellie.

586
01:15:47,506 --> 01:15:50,086
This is San Francisco
attempting contact.

587
01:15:50,133 --> 01:15:51,473
If anyone is receiving this message...

588
01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:55,640
We ask that you identify yourself
and your location. Over.

589
01:16:08,026 --> 01:16:09,646
Move, move!

590
01:16:23,876 --> 01:16:27,956
If you are receiving this signal,
please state your location. Over.

591
01:16:28,005 --> 01:16:32,015
Repeat. This is San Francisco
attempting to establish contact.

592
01:16:32,050 --> 01:16:33,300
If you are receiving this signal...

593
01:16:33,343 --> 01:16:36,053
Please state your identity
and your location. Over.

594
01:16:37,639 --> 01:16:38,599
What is it?

595
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:39,970
The apes attacked the armory, sir.

596
01:16:43,187 --> 01:16:46,727
Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm!

597
01:17:19,890 --> 01:17:24,770
Keep them off the walls!
Keep them off the walls!

598
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:30,610
Let's go! Get into position.

599
01:17:34,905 --> 01:17:36,325
-You ready?
-Yes, sir.

600
01:17:36,365 --> 01:17:37,705
Good.

601
01:17:38,784 --> 01:17:40,044
Listen to me.

602
01:17:40,744 --> 01:17:43,914
We are survivors!

603
01:17:43,956 --> 01:17:46,366
Now, they may have got their hands
on some of our guns...

604
01:17:46,416 --> 01:17:48,706
But that does not make them men.

605
01:17:49,461 --> 01:17:51,341
They are animals!

606
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:52,460
We will push them back!

607
01:17:53,382 --> 01:17:55,262
Drive them down!

608
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:59,220
And they will not
get through these doors!

609
01:18:37,134 --> 01:18:38,804
There! California street!

610
01:20:26,785 --> 01:20:28,405
Bring me the rocket launcher!

611
01:22:41,879 --> 01:22:42,999
We have a beacon marking our location.

612
01:22:43,046 --> 01:22:45,256
Please, we need help.
We are under attack.

613
01:22:45,299 --> 01:22:47,009
San Francisco. Repeat.

614
01:22:47,050 --> 01:22:47,840
Hello?

615
01:22:47,885 --> 01:22:49,225
Do you copy?

616
01:23:15,579 --> 01:23:18,459
Humans escaping! Capture them!

617
01:23:40,687 --> 01:23:42,977
We must be getting close.

618
01:23:49,112 --> 01:23:51,362
I think I see it. It's down here!

619
01:23:55,327 --> 01:23:56,617
Dad!

620
01:24:13,303 --> 01:24:15,353
Oh, my God. Malcolm!

621
01:24:15,389 --> 01:24:16,809
Ellie, help me.

622
01:24:29,987 --> 01:24:31,317
My...

623
01:24:32,197 --> 01:24:33,317
Son...

624
01:24:36,118 --> 01:24:37,738
My...

625
01:24:38,412 --> 01:24:40,122
Family...

626
01:24:44,585 --> 01:24:45,965
Where?

627
01:24:50,591 --> 01:24:52,591
I don't know.

628
01:25:01,268 --> 01:25:04,938
Try not to speak. You need to rest.

629
01:25:14,114 --> 01:25:15,744
Hold.

630
01:25:26,585 --> 01:25:27,795
He's lost a lot of blood.

631
01:25:27,836 --> 01:25:29,456
Is he going to make it?

632
01:25:30,047 --> 01:25:31,547
I don't understand.

633
01:25:33,091 --> 01:25:34,801
Where did carver get the gun?

634
01:25:35,636 --> 01:25:37,216
Why would he do this?

635
01:25:37,262 --> 01:25:38,432
Ape...

636
01:25:40,974 --> 01:25:42,184
What?

637
01:25:45,229 --> 01:25:46,689
Ape...

638
01:25:47,231 --> 01:25:48,771
Did...

639
01:25:50,484 --> 01:25:52,154
This.

640
01:25:59,451 --> 01:26:01,371
Get in the truck.

641
01:26:21,723 --> 01:26:24,483
Followed the humans here. Hiding everywhere!

642
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:27,600
We must catch them all!

643
01:26:46,081 --> 01:26:47,621
Kill him.

644
01:26:47,666 --> 01:26:48,666
No, no, no.

645
01:26:54,256 --> 01:26:56,466
Go ahead ash...

646
01:26:56,884 --> 01:26:59,684
...make humans pay.

647
01:27:03,182 --> 01:27:06,482
Caesar wouldn't want this.

648
01:27:44,848 --> 01:27:47,978
Caesar gone...

649
01:27:53,190 --> 01:27:55,690
Apes follow...

650
01:27:56,443 --> 01:27:58,863
Koba now.

651
01:28:20,092 --> 01:28:22,432
Oh, my God.
Look, the colony's on fire.

652
01:28:22,469 --> 01:28:24,509
Where are we going to go?

653
01:28:24,555 --> 01:28:26,435
Caesar, what?

654
01:28:34,940 --> 01:28:36,940
Is this it?
Are we close?

655
01:28:37,234 --> 01:28:38,574
Where is he taking us?

656
01:28:41,572 --> 01:28:42,452
Malcolm, stop!

657
01:28:50,914 --> 01:28:54,294
I don't understand.
What are we doing here?

658
01:28:54,334 --> 01:28:55,384
It doesn't matter.

659
01:28:55,419 --> 01:28:58,339
We just need a place to hide him
until we find out what's going on at home.

660
01:29:02,926 --> 01:29:04,506
Go move the table.

661
01:29:08,265 --> 01:29:10,645
Okay. Right here.

662
01:29:11,768 --> 01:29:12,768
Okay.

663
01:29:17,608 --> 01:29:18,438
Dad, look.

664
01:29:20,485 --> 01:29:21,645
Look.

665
01:29:27,367 --> 01:29:29,697
We need to operate.
I don't have anything.

666
01:29:30,829 --> 01:29:32,579
There's a surgical kit
back at the place, but that's--

667
01:29:32,623 --> 01:29:33,673
I'll go.

668
01:29:36,001 --> 01:29:37,041
It's not safe.

669
01:29:37,085 --> 01:29:40,005
He's the only one that can stop this.

670
01:29:42,466 --> 01:29:44,176
Humans!

671
01:29:44,510 --> 01:29:48,220
You ape prisoner now!

672
01:29:48,263 --> 01:29:52,103
You will know life in cage.

673
01:29:53,310 --> 01:29:55,810
More humans out there.

674
01:29:56,522 --> 01:29:59,112
Go! Find them!

675
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:20,420
Maurice...?

676
01:30:21,171 --> 01:30:23,091
Koba said...

677
01:30:23,799 --> 01:30:26,679
...we're too loyal to your father.

678
01:30:29,221 --> 01:30:32,851
Protect yourself.

679
01:31:52,596 --> 01:31:53,676
Shit!

680
01:33:03,876 --> 01:33:05,416
Hey, wait.

681
01:33:06,837 --> 01:33:08,297
Your father.

682
01:33:11,091 --> 01:33:13,091
He's alive.

683
01:33:25,397 --> 01:33:26,357
I got it.

684
01:33:26,857 --> 01:33:28,067
How is he?

685
01:33:52,966 --> 01:33:55,756
Your... mother.

686
01:33:58,263 --> 01:33:59,643
Brother.

687
01:34:00,807 --> 01:34:02,137
Safe?

688
01:34:03,477 --> 01:34:05,557
For now.

689
01:34:14,112 --> 01:34:15,162
No.

690
01:34:15,572 --> 01:34:16,702
No.

691
01:34:19,910 --> 01:34:22,370
Not human.

692
01:34:26,625 --> 01:34:28,215
Koba.

693
01:34:32,089 --> 01:34:33,049
Malcolm.

694
01:34:33,799 --> 01:34:35,259
Yeah.

695
01:34:36,927 --> 01:34:38,257
Caesar.

696
01:34:39,930 --> 01:34:42,060
We need to do this now.

697
01:34:46,061 --> 01:34:47,561
Son.

698
01:35:22,347 --> 01:35:24,017
How is he?

699
01:35:26,310 --> 01:35:27,850
We'll see.

700
01:35:29,354 --> 01:35:31,364
He's very strong.

701
01:35:40,782 --> 01:35:42,782
It's gonna be okay.

702
01:36:16,026 --> 01:36:18,066
I'm so sorry...

703
01:36:18,987 --> 01:36:20,567
For everything.

704
01:36:22,157 --> 01:36:23,657
No.

705
01:36:27,454 --> 01:36:29,164
I...

706
01:36:29,498 --> 01:36:30,868
Am to blame.

707
01:36:33,335 --> 01:36:35,545
But koba betrayed you.

708
01:36:35,879 --> 01:36:37,299
I...

709
01:36:37,339 --> 01:36:40,969
Chose to trust him...

710
01:36:41,635 --> 01:36:45,725
Because he is ape.

711
01:36:46,890 --> 01:36:49,230
I always think...

712
01:36:49,810 --> 01:36:53,690
Ape better than human.

713
01:36:55,983 --> 01:36:58,073
I see now...

714
01:36:59,862 --> 01:37:04,242
How much like them we are.

715
01:37:08,745 --> 01:37:11,075
Where koba now?

716
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,290
On the human tower...

717
01:37:16,461 --> 01:37:18,711
Loyal apes around him.

718
01:37:18,755 --> 01:37:22,215
And those who not follow?

719
01:37:22,759 --> 01:37:24,639
Prisoners.

720
01:37:25,971 --> 01:37:27,351
Maurice.

721
01:37:28,015 --> 01:37:29,435
Rocket.

722
01:37:33,687 --> 01:37:35,977
Koba killed ash.

723
01:37:42,446 --> 01:37:44,486
Fear makes others follow.

724
01:37:47,034 --> 01:37:48,794
But when they see you alive...

725
01:37:50,370 --> 01:37:53,420
They will turn from koba.

726
01:37:53,457 --> 01:37:55,247
Not if I am weak.

727
01:37:58,128 --> 01:38:02,418
Ape always seek strongest branch.

728
01:38:05,552 --> 01:38:09,472
I must do something to stop him.

729
01:38:19,608 --> 01:38:21,318
Father.

730
01:38:23,987 --> 01:38:27,947
Let me help you.

731
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:21,208
Please, let us out of here!

732
01:41:40,893 --> 01:41:42,023
Okay.

733
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:43,940
Caesar, look.

734
01:41:44,855 --> 01:41:46,065
Apple.

735
01:41:46,732 --> 01:41:47,862
Apple.

736
01:41:48,275 --> 01:41:50,195
Good.

737
01:41:51,028 --> 01:41:52,198
Home.

738
01:41:52,905 --> 01:41:54,285
Home.

739
01:41:56,408 --> 01:41:57,778
Home.

740
01:41:59,536 --> 01:42:00,616
Yes.

741
01:42:02,539 --> 01:42:04,419
This is your home.

742
01:42:04,917 --> 01:42:06,377
Your home.

743
01:42:08,795 --> 01:42:10,625
Good. Good.

744
01:42:11,632 --> 01:42:13,222
That's good.

745
01:42:36,281 --> 01:42:37,911
Sorry.

746
01:42:37,950 --> 01:42:40,080
I didn't mean to intrude.

747
01:42:44,081 --> 01:42:46,461
It's been two days.

748
01:42:52,548 --> 01:42:54,718
Your son is not back yet?

749
01:42:59,721 --> 01:43:01,681
Who was that?

750
01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:04,730
On the video.

751
01:43:07,479 --> 01:43:10,819
A good man.

752
01:43:13,694 --> 01:43:16,034
Like you.

753
01:43:46,852 --> 01:43:48,812
They need to get to the tower
without being seen.

754
01:43:48,854 --> 01:43:50,814
I'm gonna take him through the subway.

755
01:43:51,607 --> 01:43:52,727
I love you.

756
01:43:53,317 --> 01:43:56,697
Koba sent for the females and young.

757
01:43:56,737 --> 01:43:59,277
They're on their way.

758
01:43:59,615 --> 01:44:01,035
Mother too.

759
01:44:02,451 --> 01:44:04,701
Must go. Now!

760
01:44:16,006 --> 01:44:17,166
Are you okay?

761
01:44:27,976 --> 01:44:29,306
Who's there?

762
01:44:29,978 --> 01:44:32,358
If you're human, you better say so!

763
01:44:32,397 --> 01:44:34,357
It's me! It's Malcolm!

764
01:44:34,399 --> 01:44:35,689
Don't shoot!

765
01:44:37,778 --> 01:44:39,148
Take the stairs.

766
01:44:39,196 --> 01:44:41,446
They'll bring you around and
up under the street, okay?

767
01:44:41,490 --> 01:44:42,530
Go.

768
01:44:46,620 --> 01:44:47,580
Thank you.

769
01:44:48,372 --> 01:44:50,212
Trust.

770
01:44:57,256 --> 01:44:59,296
All right, I'm coming out!

771
01:44:59,341 --> 01:45:01,051
Don't shoot!

772
01:45:18,861 --> 01:45:20,241
Hey!

773
01:45:20,279 --> 01:45:21,819
Look who I found.

774
01:45:21,864 --> 01:45:24,074
I didn't know if you'd made it out.

775
01:45:24,116 --> 01:45:25,276
Good to see you.

776
01:45:25,325 --> 01:45:26,865
Don't worry.

777
01:45:26,910 --> 01:45:28,580
We're gonna turn all this around.

778
01:45:28,620 --> 01:45:30,540
What do you mean? What's going on?

779
01:45:30,581 --> 01:45:32,421
The apes. They're all over the tower.

780
01:45:32,457 --> 01:45:34,327
I lost the signal. It dropped out.

781
01:45:34,376 --> 01:45:35,456
Keep trying.

782
01:45:35,502 --> 01:45:37,002
Malcolm, look at this.

783
01:45:38,380 --> 01:45:41,630
C-4. Five-pound blocks.

784
01:45:42,259 --> 01:45:44,509
We just started setting them.

785
01:45:44,553 --> 01:45:47,013
They're gonna take down the whole tower.

786
01:45:49,224 --> 01:45:51,564
Blast them all at once.

787
01:45:52,144 --> 01:45:54,064
We could use your help.

788
01:46:32,601 --> 01:46:35,981
This is San Francisco attempting contact.

790
01:46:43,195 --> 01:46:45,115

791

And your location. Over.

793
01:46:58,043 --> 01:46:59,343
This is San Francisco...

794
01:46:59,378 --> 01:47:01,758
Attempting contact.
If anyone is receiving this...

795
01:47:01,797 --> 01:47:04,667
We ask that you identify yourself
and your location.

796
01:47:07,219 --> 01:47:09,179
-Hey.
-Hey.

797
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:19,440
If anyone is receiving this,
we ask that you identify yourself...

798
01:47:19,481 --> 01:47:20,771
And your location. Over.

799
01:47:25,487 --> 01:47:26,567
Dreyfus.

800
01:47:30,784 --> 01:47:32,244
-Can anybody hear me?
-Werner.

801
01:47:35,622 --> 01:47:38,542
I'm sorry, but I can't let you do this.

802
01:47:39,835 --> 01:47:41,675
We need to give him a chance.

803
01:47:42,671 --> 01:47:44,591
We need to give him some time.

804
01:47:45,299 --> 01:47:47,009
He's up there right now.

805
01:47:49,595 --> 01:47:51,435
Who's up there?

806
01:48:28,008 --> 01:48:33,808
Caesar has no place here.

807
01:48:35,766 --> 01:48:37,806
Apes follow...

808
01:48:38,936 --> 01:48:40,596
Koba now.

809
01:48:44,191 --> 01:48:46,651
Follow koba...

810
01:48:47,611 --> 01:48:48,651
To war.

811
01:48:48,946 --> 01:48:51,526
Apes win war!

812
01:48:53,158 --> 01:48:56,448
Apes together strong!

813
01:49:01,625 --> 01:49:03,045
Caesar...

814
01:49:04,503 --> 01:49:05,843
Weak.

815
01:49:09,633 --> 01:49:12,723
Koba weaker.

816
01:50:02,019 --> 01:50:04,599
Are you out of your fucking mind?

817
01:50:05,355 --> 01:50:08,355
No, I've seen things.
I've seen the way they are.

818
01:50:09,193 --> 01:50:11,193
They want what we want, to survive.

819
01:50:11,236 --> 01:50:12,486
They don't want a war.

820
01:50:12,529 --> 01:50:14,159
They're animals!

821
01:50:14,198 --> 01:50:15,568
They attacked us!

822
01:50:15,616 --> 01:50:18,406
Because they thought we attacked them.
They think that he's dead, but he's not--

823
01:50:18,452 --> 01:50:20,042
sit down, Finney!

824
01:50:20,787 --> 01:50:22,207
Sit down!

825
01:50:45,562 --> 01:50:47,652
Trusted koba like brother.

826
01:50:47,981 --> 01:50:51,281
Caesar brother to human!

827
01:50:53,737 --> 01:50:56,407
Koba fight for ape!

828
01:50:56,740 --> 01:50:58,490
Free ape!

829
01:51:01,078 --> 01:51:02,448
Kill ape.

830
01:51:02,496 --> 01:51:04,076
Koba fight for koba.

831
01:51:12,923 --> 01:51:14,263
Koba...

832
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:18,510
Belong in cage.

833
01:52:06,643 --> 01:52:08,773
I know how this must sound.

834
01:52:08,812 --> 01:52:09,852
I don't think you have any--

835
01:52:15,527 --> 01:52:17,567
do you think stopping me will matter?

836
01:52:18,155 --> 01:52:19,825
They're coming.

837
01:52:20,991 --> 01:52:23,411
Now, we made contact with a
military base up north.

838
01:52:24,369 --> 01:52:26,909
They're already on their way!

839
01:52:27,706 --> 01:52:28,826
It's true.

840
01:52:33,754 --> 01:52:34,634
Dreyfus!

841
01:52:34,671 --> 01:52:36,171
What are you doing, man?

842
01:52:46,350 --> 01:52:48,310
I'm saving the human race.

843
01:52:48,352 --> 01:52:49,192
No!

844
01:55:10,661 --> 01:55:11,871
Ape...

845
01:55:12,704 --> 01:55:14,664
Not kill...

846
01:55:15,541 --> 01:55:16,831
Ape.

847
01:55:42,359 --> 01:55:44,569
You are...

848
01:55:46,363 --> 01:55:48,203
Not ape.

849
01:55:52,035 --> 01:55:53,615
No!

850
01:57:07,945 --> 01:57:09,455
Leave him!

851
01:57:27,297 --> 01:57:29,007
You're not safe here.

852
01:57:29,633 --> 01:57:32,343
They made contact.
Other people are coming. Soldiers.

853
01:57:32,928 --> 01:57:34,968
You have to leave now. Everyone.

854
01:57:35,973 --> 01:57:39,643
If you don't go,
it'll be all-out war.

855
01:57:39,685 --> 01:57:41,445
War...

856
01:57:41,478 --> 01:57:43,608
Has already...

857
01:57:44,690 --> 01:57:45,820
Begun.

858
01:57:47,818 --> 01:57:50,568
Ape started war.

859
01:57:53,699 --> 01:57:55,409
And human...

860
01:57:57,828 --> 01:58:00,868
Human will not forgive.

861
01:58:04,084 --> 01:58:07,844
You must go...

862
01:58:08,172 --> 01:58:11,882
Before fighting begins.

863
01:58:13,719 --> 01:58:15,509
I am sorry...

864
01:58:18,015 --> 01:58:20,935
My friend.

865
01:58:25,689 --> 01:58:28,569
I thought we had a chance.

866
01:58:31,945 --> 01:58:34,565
I did, too.
