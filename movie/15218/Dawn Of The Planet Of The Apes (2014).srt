1
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,900
如果你发烧 咳嗽 或者嗓子痛的话 请呆在家里
If you have a fever and cough or sore throat... stay home.

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,110
我觉得这东西有95%的可能是人工制造的 来自一个实验室
I'd say 95% chance this is manufactured. Came out of a laboratory.

3
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,990
这个病毒的来源...
The source of the virus was traced back...

4
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,450
是在旧金山的人工基因实验室里进行的药物测试
to drug testing done at Gen-Sys Laboratories in San Francisco.

5
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,830
首个病例是实验室里的一个技术员...
The lab technician now known as Patient Zero...

6
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,750
意外地被逆转录病毒ALZ-113号感染...
was accidentally exposed to retrovirus ALZ-113....

7
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,630
这是一种正在猩猩身上进行试验 用于治疗老年痴呆的药物
an Alzheimer's trial drug that was being tested on chimpanzees.

8
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,960
被感染的猩猩展现了反复无常并极具攻击性的行为...
The infected chimps showed signs of erratic and aggressive behavior...

9
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,920
并最后逃出了这个机构
that led to their escape from the facility.

10
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,300
著名的金门大桥事件...
The now-famous incident on the Golden Gate Bridge...

11
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,340
猩猩们和警方僵持了六个小时...
a six-hour standoff with police...

12
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,010
最后消失在了红木林里
ended with the apes disappearing into Muir Woods.

13
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:39,770
急诊室里挤满了大批的病人...
Emergency rooms are being overwhelmed with patients showing signs...

14
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,690
他们感染了我们现在所说的"猿流感"
of what's being dubbed "The Simian Flu."

15
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,220
疾病控制局估计...
The CDC is projecting a fatality toll...

16
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,330
在接下来的6到8个月里 死亡人数会有...
ranging from 5 million to as many as 150 million...

17
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:48,940
五百万到一亿五千万
in the next 6 to 8 months.

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,490
所有出现感染了传染病迹象的人都将在这里...
Anyone showing signs of a contagious illness will receive special treatment here...

19
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,120
机场中专门建造的隔离中心接受特殊治疗
the airport's purpose-built quarantine center.

20
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,210
这里的很多新来的孩子们都和他们的父母失去了联系
Many of the new arrivals are children who have lost contact with their parents.

21
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,830
强制的隔离激发了动乱
The mandatory quarantines have sparked civil unrest.

22
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:06,540
- 一个个家庭分崩离析 - 这个疾病目前不太可能得到控制
- Families are being ripped apart. - Containment is not very likely.

23
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,340
和你的家人们做好准备 熟悉疏散路线
Prepare your families. Know your evacuation route.

24
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,880
目前的存活率是五百分之一
The survival rate is now approximately 1 in 500.

25
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,140
今晚在市中心爆发了暴力事件
Violence erupted in the city center tonight.

26
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,640
这是这几天内发生的第三次类似事件
The third incident in as many days.

27
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,060
在28个国家中 包括美国和加拿大 都颁布了战争法
Martial law has been declared in 28 nations including the U.S. and Canada.

28
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,160
核反应堆已经过热了 我们没法阻止核熔毁
The reactor is overheating. We can't stop a meltdown.

29
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,730
这是社会秩序的彻底崩塌
Just a total collapse of anything resembling civilian order.

30
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,360
由于这次极端的猿流感危机...
Due to the extremity of the Simian Flu crisis...

31
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,670
所有的政府功能都完全停摆
all regular government functions have been suspended indefinitely.

32
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,410
那些没有被病毒杀死的...
Those who aren't killed by the virus...

33
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,850
也很可能在暴力冲突中死亡
will probably die in the fighting.

34
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,670
所以 也许就这样了
So, maybe this is it.

35
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,880
这就是末日
This is how it ends.

36
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,980
很快...
Pretty soon...

37
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,150
所有人都会死
there won't be anyone left.

38
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,620
猩球崛起: 黎明之战

39
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,620
凯撒...
Caesar...

40
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,590
他们在接近了
They are close.

41
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,140
科巴!
Koba!

42
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,250
父亲 现在怎么做?
Now, father?

43
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,310
孩子 你待着...
Son, stay...

44
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,390
谢谢你 科巴
Thank you, Koba.

45
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,080
孩子 三思而后行
Think before you act, son.

46
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,690
蓝眼 别伤心...
Don't feel bad, Blue Eyes...

47
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:32,150
伤疤会让你更强壮
Scars make you strong.

48
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:52,250
来见见你的新弟弟
Come meet your new brother.

49
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,650
又生了一个儿子
Another son.

50
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:18,320
这让我想到我们已经走了那么远了 毛里斯
Makes me think how far we've come, Maurice.

51
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:25,330
好像是很久以前
Seems long ago.

52
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:31,540
你还想着他们吗?
Still think about them?

53
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,000
人类?
Humans?

54
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,420
有时候会想
Sometimes.

55
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,180
我不像你那么了解他们
Didn't know them like you did.

56
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:48,770
我只看到了他们恶毒的那一面
Only saw their bad side.

57
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:53,520
善良还是恶毒... 现在也都不重要了
Good, bad... doesn't matter now.

58
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:57,360
人类互相毁灭
Humans destroyed each other.

59
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,240
猩猩之间也会打斗
Apes fight too.

60
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:03,200
但我们是一个家庭
But we are family.

61
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,290
我不知道他们是不是真的都走了
Wonder if they're really all gone.

62
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,280
已经过去十年了...
Ten winters now...

63
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:19,550
近两年... 都没看到他们
Last two... no sign of them.

64
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,550
他们一定已经走了吧
They must be gone.

65
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,110
蓝眼 那头熊伤不到我的 我动作很快!
That bear wouldn't get me Blue Eyes. I'm quick!

66
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,510
灰烬 闭嘴!
Shut up, Ash!

67
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,920
天啊
Oh, God.

68
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,850
没事
It's okay.

69
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:27,520
没事的 没事的
It's okay. It's okay.

70
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,780
不许动!
Freeze!

71
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:46,550
不许动! 救命啊!
Stay! Help!

72
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,890
救命啊! 不要!
Help! No!

73
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,220
嘿!
Hey!

74
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,810
这里来!
Over here!

75
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,650
我打中他了! 我打中他了
I shot him! I shot him.

76
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:34,350
他们向灰烬开枪了! 他们打中了我儿子!
They shot Ash! Shot my son!

77
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,520
火箭 等等...
Rocket, wait...

78
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,050
我们无意冒犯!
We don't mean any harm!

79
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:49,530
哥们 他们是猩猩 你觉得他们听得懂你讲话吗?
They're apes, man. You think they understand what you're saying?

80
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,540
你觉得他们看起来是普通猩猩吗?
Do they look like just apes to you?

81
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,620
- 爸 - 马尔科姆 你在干什么?
- Dad. - Malcolm, what are you doing?

82
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,040
- 爸? - 马尔科姆
- Dad? - Malcolm.

83
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,720
没事的
It's okay.

84
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,290
把你们的枪放下
Put your guns down.

85
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,730
- 不会吧 - 照做就行
- You can't be serious. - Do it.

86
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,570
给我滚!
Go!

87
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,660
- 我靠 - 我靠
- Holy shit. - Holy shit.

88
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,320
好的 我们马上走
Okay. Okay, we're going.

89
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,820
滚!
Go!

90
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,040
慢慢来 我们走
Slowly. Go, go, go!

91
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,680
- 我的包! - 赶紧走
- My bag! - Go!

92
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,530
科巴!
Koba!

93
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,700
跟着他们!
Follow!

94
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,710
你找到了吗?
Did you find it?

95
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,820
我们需要谈谈
We need to talk.

96
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,210
怎么了? 有什么问题吗?
What? What's wrong?

97
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,070
水坝差不多保存完好
The dam is pretty much intact.

98
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,490
大概一个礼拜之内 它就可以开始为我们发电了
It could probably start generating power for us within a week.

99
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:15,180
但是我们有个麻烦 上车说
But there is a problem. Get in.

100
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:29,510
我打中他了 我很害怕 我不知道怎么办
I shot him. I was scared. I didn't know what to do.

101
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:32,680
天啊 他们有多少?
Jesus Christ. How many were there?

102
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,930
很多 差不多80只
A lot. Like, 80.

103
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,270
- 至少这数 - 好吧...
- At least. - Okay...

104
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:39,190
你没在仔细听 他们说话了!
you're not hearing what he's saying. They spoke!

105
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,570
不可能
That is not possible.

106
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,610
相信我 德雷福斯 他们真的说话了 真是难以置信
I'm telling you, Dreyfus, they did and it was incredible.

107
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,690
难以置信? 他们是会说话的大猩猩!
Incredible? They're talking apes!

108
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,660
- 他们还有很大的矛! - 拜托!
- With big-ass spears! - Please!

109
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,170
我不知道你到底看到或者听到了什么...
I don't know exactly what you think you saw or heard...

110
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,660
但你必须冷静下来 行吗?
but you have to calm down, okay?

111
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,690
还有那个病毒呢? 艾莉 我们有没有可能被感染?
What about the virus, Ellie? Any chance of contagion?

112
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:01,020
我们都是在基因上对这个病毒免疫的 否则我们早就死了
We're all genetically immune or we would've been dead a long time ago.

113
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,860
- 你也不确定吧 - 她在疾控局工作 她确定
- You don't know that for sure. - She worked with the CDC. She knows.

114
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,860
- 我们该怎么办? - 不知道
- What are we gonna do? - I don't know.

115
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,170
- 我们需要电力 - 他本可以杀了我们的 但他没有
- We need that power. - He could've killed us, but he didn't.

116
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:13,580
也许他放我们一条活路 然后跟踪我们
Maybe he kept us alive, so they could follow us.

117
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,710
他们可以找到我们的住所 然后把我们一网打尽
They find out where we are, and they kill us all!

118
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:19,880
- 什么意思 你说"他"? - 我们一直想告诉你
- What do you mean, "he"? - That's what we're trying to tell you.

119
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,310
这事前所未见 他们有一个领导者...
It was unlike anything you've ever seen before, and the leader...

120
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,010
- 他太惊人了 - 真的?
- He was remarkable. - Really?

121
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,890
- 你们是这么想的? - 这是我们亲眼所见
- Is that what you thought? - It's what we saw.

122
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,220
我们所有人都目睹了
Yeah, it's what we all saw.

123
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,680
回到居住区 什么都不要说 懂吗?
Not a word of this back at the colony, you understand me?

124
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,600
在我们想出对策之前什么都不要说
Not a word until we can figure out what to do.

125
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,700
- 你一定是在逗我 - 不 我是认真的
- You gotta be kidding. - No, I'm not kidding.

126
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,210
我不想让大家恐慌
I don't want to create a panic.

127
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,420
兄弟 你怎么样? 你还好吗?
How are you doing, pal? Are you okay?

128
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,420
- 我把我的包弄丢了 - 我知道
- I dropped my bag. - I know.

129
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,710
- 你的画图本在里面吗? - 它不见了
- Was your sketchbook in there? - It's gone.

130
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,970
卡佛跟我说 我们之前遇到的事情不能告诉任何人
Carver just told me we're not gonna tell anybody what happened up there.

131
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,240
现在暂时不行
Not yet. No.

132
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,960
我们必须现在进攻他们!
Must attack them now!

133
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,430
否则他们就要来攻击我们了!
Before they attack us!

134
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,920
我们不知道他们到底有多少人
We don't know how many there are.

135
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,650
也不知道他们有多少枪
How many guns they have?

136
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,730
我们也不知道他们为什么在这里
Or why they came up here?

137
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,600
火箭 他们开枪打了你儿子!
They shot your son, Rocket!

138
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,620
你不想大战一场吗?
Don't you want to fight?

139
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,630
我会追随凯撒
I follow Caesar.

140
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,170
科巴说的对!
Koba's right!

141
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,130
他们差点就把你杀了 灰烬!
They almost killed you, Ash!

142
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,560
不行!
No!

143
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,710
如果我们开战...
If we go to war...

144
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,940
我们有可能失去一切...
We could lose all we've built...

145
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,700
我们的家园
Home.

146
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,280
我们的家庭
Family.

147
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,920
还有我们的未来
Future.

148
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:00,510
我会在明天早上之前做决定
I will decide by morning.

149
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,110
凯撒
Caesar.

150
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:22,520
我在他们的实验室里被囚禁了好几年...
For years I was a prisoner in their lab...

151
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,190
他们用刀切我...
They cut me...

152
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,000
折磨我
Tortured me.

153
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,000
是你让我获得自由
You freed me.

154
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:34,340
你要我做什么我都会照做
I would do anything you ask.

155
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,180
但是我们必须展示自己的力量!
But we must show strength!

156
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,180
我们会的 科巴
We will, Koba.

157
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:29,180
借过 借过
Coming through. Coming through.

158
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:52,580
这可远远不止八十个了!
That's a hell of a lot more than eighty!

159
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,450
马尔科姆!
Malcolm!

160
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,020
我们猩猩...
Apes...

161
00:23:55,950 --> 00:24:00,980
不想开战...
do not want war...

162
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:04,990
但如果别无选择...
but will fight...

163
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:09,120
我们会死战到底
if we must.

164
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,900
那里是我们猩猩的家园
Ape home.

165
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:49,700
这里是你们人类的家园
Human home.

166
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:57,500
不要再来了
Do not come back.

167
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,750
各位!
Everyone!

168
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:43,420
你们要冷静下来!
Everyone, you have to calm down!

169
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:52,090
各位
Everybody.

170
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,330
各位!
Everybody!

171
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:57,770
求你们了! 我们是免疫的!
Please! We're all immune!

172
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:02,710
我们都是免疫的 否则我们就不会在这了!
We're all immune, or we wouldn't still be here!

173
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:04,770
他们怎么找到我们的?
How did they find us?

174
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,800
是我们找到了他们
We found them.

175
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,350
- 你知道他们在那! - 他们回来怎么办?
- You knew they were out there! - What if they come back?

176
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,310
对啊!
Yeah!

177
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:14,140
如果他们回来... 如果他们回来了...
If they come back... If they come back...

178
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,390
他们会后悔的!
they'll be sorry they ever did!

179
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:23,760
现在我们这个城市也许不像以前一样有那么多人 但是我们有火力优势
Now, this city may not have the manpower it once did but it has the firepower.

180
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:27,680
我们有联邦应急管理局
Those stockpiles left behind by FEMA,

181
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:30,910
和国家守卫队留下来的装备
the National Guard, we have it all.

182
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:33,300
你们听我说...
Look...

183
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:37,310
我知道你们为什么害怕
I know why you're scared.

184
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,750
相信我 我也害怕
I'm scared, too, believe me.

185
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,630
但是我知道你们都信任我
But I recognize the trust you've all placed in me.

186
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:49,150
我们一起经历了那么多
We've been through hell together.

187
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:54,660
但是你们都知道我们面对的是什么
But you all know what we're up against.

188
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,410
我们马上就没有燃料了
We're almost out of fuel.

189
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:03,230
这样我们就没有电力...
Which means no more power...

190
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,900
那我们就倒退到以前了
which means we could slip back to the way things were.

191
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,510
那个水坝是我们的解决方案
That dam up there was the answer.

192
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,160
我们只是没想到他们也在那里
We just had no idea they were up there, too.

193
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,580
- 那我们现在怎么办? - 对啊!
- So, what do we do now? - Yeah!

194
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,020
我们另寻出路...
We find another way...

195
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:27,420
因为电力... 并不仅仅是可以用来开电灯
because that power... is not just about keeping the lights on.

196
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,470
这给我们与整个世界连接的工具
It's about giving us the tools to reconnect to the rest of the world.

197
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:35,520
让我们找到其他人...
To find out who else is out there...

198
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:40,170
这样我们才能开始重建...
so that we can start to rebuild...

199
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:44,120
并夺回...
and reclaim...

200
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:49,600
我们失去的世界
the world we lost.

201
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:56,090
这演说真棒
That was a great speech.

202
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,140
没有替代的电源了
There is no alternative power source.

203
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,270
那个大坝是我们唯一的选择
That dam is the only option.

204
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,650
那我们和他们死战到底
Well, then, we fight them.

205
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:19,390
我们还有两个礼拜就没有燃料了 最多三个礼拜
We're two weeks away from running out of fuel. Maybe three, tops.

206
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,980
- 我知道 - 一旦如此...
- I know. - And once that happens...

207
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,070
我就没法拿着扩音器...
I won't be able to go out there with a bullhorn...

208
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,570
让大家冷静下来了
and calm everybody down.

209
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:32,660
我们需要电力来使用无线电发射器
We need that power to get the radio transmitter working.

210
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,330
这是我们和外界取得联系的唯一方式了
It's our only chance of reaching the outside world.

211
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,370
我们必须找到其他的幸存者
We have to find other survivors.

212
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:41,970
是啊 人类已经所剩无几了
Yeah. There's not that many of us left.

213
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:47,100
- 我们没法再接受更多的伤亡了 - 我们建立了这里的一切...
- We can't afford any more casualties. - We founded this place...

214
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,880
- 我和你... - 我知道
- you and I... - I know.

215
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:54,260
因为电力可以带领我们回到曾经有过的生活
On the idea that power would lead us back to the life we once had.

216
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,010
如果我们不能团结一致 我们也许就不能存活了
If we can't stick together, maybe we can't survive.

217
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,620
我失去了一切
I lost everything.

218
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:05,120
如果我再失去现在仅有的这些 那...
The idea of losing what little I have is...

219
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,290
我要回到那里去
I want to go back up there.

220
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,740
听我说 给我三天时间
Listen to me. Give me three days.

221
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,120
让我和他谈一谈 如果没用 我们再按照你说的来
Let me talk to him. If it doesn't work, then we do it your way.

222
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,370
万一造成了反效果呢? 万一他变得很暴力怎么办?
And what if it backfires? What if he gets violent?

223
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:22,680
你怎么知道他能理解你?
I mean, how do you know that he'll even understand you?

224
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:28,730
他不仅仅是一只猩猩
He's more than just an ape.

225
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:32,720
我带一些人到堡垒去
I'm gonna take some men up to Fort Point.

226
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:38,030
去看看我们的军火库里面还有没有什么是能用的
I'm gonna go through the armory. I'm gonna see what's still working.

227
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:42,660
你只有三天 如果你三天之内没有回来 我们就会去红木林
Three days. You're not back in three days we're going up there,

228
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,240
会杀死他们所有人
and we're gonna kill every last one of them.

229
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,870
卡佛去准备车子了
Carver is getting the trucks ready.

230
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:07,180
他和福斯特还有坎普马上就会过来
He'll be here with Foster and Kemp any minute.

231
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,380
你真的要带卡佛去? 他可是向他们开枪了
You're really taking Carver? I mean, he shot one of them.

232
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,500
我别无选择 他曾经在水利局工作过
I don't really have any choice. He used to work at the water department.

233
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,100
只有他知道那个大坝怎么工作的
He's the only one who knows how the dam works.

234
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,760
马尔科姆...
Malcolm...

235
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:23,950
你到底打算做什么? 你打算说什么?
what are you gonna do up there? What are you gonna say?

236
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:28,120
我会告诉他真相
I'll tell him the truth.

237
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:31,120
希望他心情正好
Hope I catch him in a good mood.

238
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,340
你觉得我疯了
You think I'm crazy.

239
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,180
我很担心
I'm worried.

240
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:44,100
嗯 我也是
Yeah, so am I.

241
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,560
我已经想过了...
I've gone over it in my head...

242
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:51,890
我觉得如果我连试都不试一下...
and I think if I don't at least try this...

243
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:55,270
我们一定会开战的
there's gonna be a war.

244
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:21,090
带上我吧 万一有人受伤的话 你需要我
Take me with you. What if someone gets hurt? You'll need me there.

245
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,000
我爱你
I love you.

246
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,890
但是我需要你留在这里
But I need you to stay here.

247
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,790
我也不希望亚历山大一个人留下
I don't want Alexander to be alone.

248
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:35,150
我也来
I'm coming, too.

249
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,610
孩子 这不安全
Son, it's not safe.

250
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:43,990
但是我和你们在一起会比留在这里更安全
But I'm safer with you than I am down here.

251
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:48,120
让我也去吧 求你了
I'm coming. Please.

252
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,510
大家不要离开车子
No one gets out of the trucks.

253
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:20,550
谁都不行
No one.

254
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:24,650
如果我两个小时之内没有回来 你带大家回城
If I'm not back in two hours, you get everyone back to the city.

255
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,410
没事的
It's gonna be okay.

256
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:32,590
求你了 求你了 求你了
Please. Please. Please.

257
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:37,500
求你别杀了我
Please don't kill me.

258
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,620
先听我说
Just hear what I have to say.

259
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,390
我知道
I know.

260
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:48,260
你说过让我别再回来 我知道
"Don't come back." I know.

261
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,180
我本不会来的 可是...
I wouldn't be here unless it were...

262
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,570
行! 行! 行!
Okay! Okay! Okay!

263
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,410
好吧 好吧
Okay, okay, okay.

264
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:04,520
我想给你看样东西 那地方离这里不远
I need to show you something. It's not far.

265
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:09,050
- 人类是骗子! - 不! 不是的!
- Human lies! - No! No!

266
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,340
我发誓 我没有
No, no, no. I swear.

267
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:20,530
我带你去看 你自然会明白的 求你了
If I could just show you, then you'll understand. Please.

268
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:43,870
带路吧
Show me.

269
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,260
我们之前叫这地方"小水坝"
This is what we used to call a "small hydro."

270
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,180
造它是为了供电给北部地区...
It was built to service areas to the north of here...

271
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,310
但我们正试着将电路重新接回城市里...
but we've been working to reroute the power lines to the city...

272
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:19,270
之前城市利用核能供电 但核燃料几年前燃烧殆尽
because the city used to run off nuclear power, but that ran out years ago.

273
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,850
我们现在只能靠柴油机和燃气机
So, we've been using diesel generators and gasifiers.

274
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:24,770
但如果我们能让这大坝重新运作...
But if we can just get this dam working...

275
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:29,170
就有可能解决一部分能源问题
then we have a shot at restoring limited power.

276
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,720
你听懂了吗?
Is any of this making any sense to you?

277
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:43,290
电... 灯
The... lights.

278
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:45,640
没错
Yes.

279
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,810
电灯
The lights.

280
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:53,090
这是你的家园 我保证 我对它没有任何恶意
This is your home and I don't want to take it away from you, I promise.

281
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:57,750
但如果你能同意我们解决...
But if you can let us do our work here...

282
00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:00,320
你还带了其他人类?
You brought others?

283
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,040
就几个
Just a few.

284
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:10,160
我没有恶意 如果我有的话...
I'm not a threat. If I am...

285
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:13,880
那你就直接杀了我吧
then I guess you can kill me.

286
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,600
来啊!
Come on!

287
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:45,370
- 等等 等等! - 别开枪 别开枪
- Wait, wait, wait! - Stop, stop.

288
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,050
我们要把枪给他们
We need to give them our guns.

289
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:03,200
只有这么一个条件
That's the one condition.

290
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:07,680
- 这话什么意思? - 我们可以留下
- What does that mean? - We can stay.

291
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:25,430
如果人类有了电 他们会更危险!
If they get power, they'll be more dangerous!

292
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,270
为什么要帮他们!
Why help them!

293
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:29,950
人类看上去走投无路了...
They seem desperate...

294
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:33,150
如果我们不同意的话 人类估计会打上来
If we make them go, they'll attack.

295
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:35,280
那就让他们打
Let them.

296
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:39,300
趁人类势弱 我们一举消灭他们
We'll destroy them while they're weak.

297
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,340
那得死多少同胞?
And how many apes will die?

298
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:48,920
我们有和平相处的机会的...
We have one chance for peace...

299
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:52,480
让他们完成人类的工作 之后他们就会离开的
Let them do their human work. Then they'll go.

300
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:56,610
人类的工作?
Human work?

301
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:02,190
这是人类的杰作
Human work.

302
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:07,280
这也是人类的杰作
Human work.

303
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,580
都是人类的杰作!
Human work!

304
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:48,980
科巴是说...
Koba say...

305
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,230
猩猩应该憎恨人类...
Apes should hate humans...

306
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:52,600
够了!
Enough!

307
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,070
从人类那里 科巴只学会了憎恨...
From humans Koba learned hate...

308
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:57,290
仅此而已
But nothing else.

309
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:14,310
嘿 你得吃点东西才行
Hey. You need to eat.

310
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,470
知道了
Okay.

311
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:19,360
今天你所做的一切 真是太勇敢了
That was brave, what you did today.

312
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:30,640
马尔科姆 我知道大家都指望你...
Malcolm. I know everyone's depending on you...

313
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:34,910
我不在乎这些 我不在乎
I don't care about that. I don't care about any of that.

314
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:37,380
我只关心那小子
I care about him.

315
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:43,250
他看到了小孩子不应该看到的事情 我不允许历史再重演了
He saw things that no kid should see, and I'm not letting us go back to that.

316
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:49,590
我知道
I know.

317
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:02,270
我一直试着想跟他更亲近点
I have been trying to get closer to him.

318
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,360
但是...
But...

319
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:06,440
你会的...
You will.

320
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:13,770
你知道它们的可怕之处吗?
You know the scary thing about them?

321
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:17,620
它们不需要能源 电灯
They don't need power, lights.

322
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,900
暖气 都不需要
Heat. Nothing.

323
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,920
- 嘿 伙计 - 这些都是他们的优势
- Hey, pal. - That's their advantage.

324
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,950
也是它们更强壮的原因
That's what makes them stronger.

325
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:29,780
马尔科姆 我觉得我们今晚应该有人放哨才行
Malcolm, I'm thinking one of us should stand guard tonight.

326
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,740
用什么放? 它们把枪都缴走了
With what? They took our guns.

327
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,580
如果它们要除掉我们 我们早就死了
If they wanted us dead, we would be dead already.

328
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,980
也许它们只是慢慢来而已 反正它们已经消灭半个地球的人类了
Maybe they're just taking their time. They killed off half the planet already.

329
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:39,040
拜托
Come on.

330
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,710
- 怎么了? - 你不会真的怪那些猩猩吧
- What? - You can't honestly blame the apes.

331
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:45,500
那我应该怪谁去? 本来就是猿类流感病毒
Who the hell else am I going to blame? It was the Simian Flu.

332
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,720
那也是科学家在实验室里研制出的病毒
It was a virus created by scientists in a lab.

333
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,210
那些大猩猩只是实验道具而已 它们也无可奈何
The chimps they were testing on didn't have a say in the matter.

334
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:52,390
别跟我说这些有的没的
Spare me the hippie-dippie bullshit.

335
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:56,160
你敢告诉我 你看到它们的时候 你没觉得恶心吗?
You're telling me you don't get sick to your stomach at the sight of them?

336
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:02,230
- 你之前不是有个女儿吗? - 卡佛 够了
- Didn't you have a little girl? - Carver, that's enough.

337
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:03,770
- 她怎么死的? - 够了!
- How did she die? - That's enough!

338
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:05,110
你老婆也是一样的
Or your wife, for that matter.

339
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:08,880
卡佛 你给我闭嘴 不然我就不客气了
Carver, you better shut up before I kick your ass.

340
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,470
好吧
Okay.

341
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,590
算我混蛋
I'm the asshole.

342
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,390
你没事吧?
Are you okay?

343
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:48,420
你好像病了... 你还好吗?
You sound sick... You ok?

344
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,510
只是需要休息而已
Just need rest.

345
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:03,190
你担心那些人类...
You worry about the humans...

346
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,940
科巴在哪里?
Where's Koba?

347
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,090
还在生闷气
Still angry.

348
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,760
他说要出去打猎...
Said he was going hunting...

349
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:23,430
看 下面有人类!
Look, humans below!

350
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:38,220
我们干嘛来这里?
Why are we here?

351
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,430
凯撒相信人类...
Caesar trusts humans...

352
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:44,120
科巴不相信
Koba does not.

353
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:48,020
- 大部分武器都能正常使用 - 好的
- Most of the arsenal seems functional. - Good.

354
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,290
我们在后面测试确认
We're testing them out back.

355
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:39,180
嘿!
Hey!

356
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:44,600
不准动! 不准动 明白吗?
Don't you move! Don't move, do you understand me?

357
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:49,390
泰瑞! 泰瑞 快过来 快点!
Terry! Terry, get in here, quick!

358
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:58,440
卧槽
Holy shit.

359
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:03,560
我们怎么办? 怎么办?
What do we do? What do we do?

360
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:05,580
它从哪儿来的?
Where did he come from?

361
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:09,270
- 我们要开枪吗? - 也许吧 我也不知道
- Should we shoot him? - Maybe. I don't know.

362
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:15,380
你这样子长得真难看啊 是吧?
You are one ugly son of a bitch, aren't you?

363
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:36,360
哇哦 伙计
Whoa, man.

364
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,970
伙计 我猜它是饿了
Dude, I think he's hungry.

365
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:44,470
它肯定是跟它的部落走散了
He must have gotten separated from the others.

366
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:49,250
你迷路了? 想回家去吗?
You lost? Trying to get home?

367
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:52,520
快走! 滚出去 笨猴子!
Go on! Get out of here, stupid monkey!

368
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,370
- 快走 说你呢 快走! - 快走! 走!
- Go on. You heard him. Go! - Go! Go!

369
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:06,010
有足够的枪消灭每只猩猩...
Enough guns here to kill every ape...

370
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:07,910
必须警告凯撒
Must warn Caesar.

371
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,810
谁知道人类的真正目的是什么?
Who knows what humans are really doing up there?

372
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:32,780
我们必须打通这地方
We gotta clear this blockage.

373
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,360
我不知道你有个女儿
I didn't know you had a daughter.

374
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,340
是有个
Yeah.

375
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,630
她叫什么名字?
What was her name?

376
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:00,080
萨拉
Sarah.

377
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:06,820
节哀顺变
I'm really sorry.

378
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:17,790
现在我有你和你爸爸了 所以...
Well, now I have you and your dad, so...

379
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:25,460
也是
Yeah.

380
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:28,680
好的 你拉直了吗?
All right, you got that straight?

381
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,480
引线全部拉完了
That's all the wire we got.

382
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:45,320
准备爆破
Brace yourselves.

383
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:50,320
三 二 一
Three, two, one.

384
00:49:55,790 --> 00:49:58,620
- 老爸! - 马尔科姆!
- Dad! - Malcolm!

385
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,530
马尔科姆! 马尔科姆!
Malcolm! Malcolm!

386
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:06,970
老爸?
Dad?

387
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:08,970
卡佛不见了
I can't see Carver.

388
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:33,600
别!
Don't!

389
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:36,200
- 不要拔出来 - 明白
- Leave it there. - I got it.

390
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,710
骨头没断
It's not broken.

391
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:44,330
放手 好的
Let go. Good.

392
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:57,900
谢谢你
Thank you.

393
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:02,630
你救了我们一命 我们有很多瓦砾要清理
You saved our lives. We've got a lot of debris to clear now.

394
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:06,280
- 我们估计还需要点时间 - 还要多久?
- We might need a bit more time. - How long?

395
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:45,730
嘿 伙计
Hey, buddy.

396
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,660
嘿... 嘿...
Hey... hey...

397
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,910
你在干嘛? 包扎好了吗?
What are you doing? Are you finished?

398
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:01,170
你看什么看?
What are you looking at?

399
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:11,050
嘿! 嘿!
Hey! Hey!

400
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,880
嘿 走开!
Hey, get out of there!

401
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,480
- 嘿! 我毙了你! - 卡佛 你干什么?
- Hey! I'll kill you! - Carver, what're you doing?

402
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:28,880
不要! 不要! 凯撒 住手!
Don't! Don't! Caesar, no!

403
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,690
不要
No.

404
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:49,750
说过 不准有枪!
Said no guns!

405
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,930
- 不 别开枪 - 求你了
- No, don't. - Please.

406
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:28,230
我真的不知道
I didn't know.

407
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:39,100
人类马上离开!
Human leave now!

408
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:25,560
伙计 我们完蛋了
Man, we screwed now.

409
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:30,560
马尔科姆?
Malcolm?

410
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:34,320
马尔科姆 你去哪里? 马尔科姆
Malcolm, where are you going? Malcolm.

411
00:54:40,370 --> 00:54:43,370
求你了 求你了 我只是想跟他说几句
Please, please, I just need to speak to him.

412
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:49,480
对不起 这全是我的错 我马上让他离开这里
I'm sorry. That was all my fault. But I will make him leave.

413

按着

566
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:31,440

- He's lost a lot of blood. - Is he going to make it?

567
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:33,840
我不明白
I don't understand.

568
01:25:34,890 --> 01:25:37,100
卡佛在哪里拿到的枪?
Where did Carver get the gun?

569

- 他为什么这么做? - 猩猩...

猩猩...
Ape...

572

上车
Get in the truck.

575
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:26,760
跟着人类到这里 他们藏在各个地方!
Followed the humans here. Hiding everywhere!

576
01:26:26,860 --> 01:26:29,900
我们一定把他们全都抓起来!

577
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:50,960
- 杀了他 - 不要 不要

578
01:26:56,050 --> 01:26:58,580
动手 灰烬...
Go ahead Ash...

579
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:01,970
让人类付出代价
make humans pay.

580
01:27:04,980 --> 01:27:08,770
凯撒不会想要这样的
Caesar wouldn't want this.

581
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:50,270
凯撒死了...
Caesar gone...

582
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:57,990
现在猩猩们...
Apes follow...

583
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:01,160
跟随科巴
Koba now.

584
01:28:21,890 --> 01:28:26,250
- 天啊 看 聚居地着火了 - 我们要去哪里?
- Oh, my God. Look, the colony's on fire. - Where are we going to go?

585
01:28:26,350 --> 01:28:28,730
凯撒 什么?
Caesar, what?

586
01:28:36,730 --> 01:28:40,860
- 是这里吗? 我们快到了吗? - 他要带我们去哪?
- Is this it? Are we close? - Where is he taking us?

587
01:28:43,570 --> 01:28:44,740
马尔科姆 停车!
Malcolm, stop!

588
01:28:52,710 --> 01:28:56,030
我不明白 我们来这里做什么?
I don't understand. What are we doing here?

589
01:28:56,130 --> 01:28:57,860
这不重要 我们只需要一个给他藏身的地方
It doesn't matter. We just need a place to hide him

590
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:00,160
直到我们弄明白家园发生了什么
until we find out what's going on at home.

591
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:06,810
把桌子推开
Go move the table.

592

Look.

596
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:32,000
我们需要做手术 我什么工具都没有
We need to operate. I don't have anything.

597
01:29:32,620 --> 01:29:34,320
手术器械包还在原来那里 但是那里...
There's a surgical kit back at the place, but that's...

598
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:35,960
我去拿
I'll go.

599
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:41,700
- 这不安全 - 他是唯一能阻止这场战争的人
- It's not safe. - He's the only one that can stop this.

600
01:29:44,260 --> 01:29:46,200
人类!
Humans!

601
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:49,960
你们现在是猩猩的囚犯了!
You ape prisoner now!

602
01:29:50,060 --> 01:29:54,400
你们会尝到生活在笼子里的滋味
You will know life in cage.

603
01:29:55,100 --> 01:29:58,110
还有更多的人在外面
More humans out there.

604
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:01,400
去! 找到他们!
Go! Find them!

605
01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:22,720
毛里斯...?
Maurice...?

606
01:30:22,970 --> 01:30:25,380
科巴说...
Koba said...

607
01:30:25,590 --> 01:30:28,970
我们对你爸爸太忠诚了

608
01:30:31,020 --> 01:30:35,140
保护好自己
Protect yourself.

609
01:31:54,390 --> 01:31:55,980

你爸爸

612
01:33:12,890 --> 01:33:15,390
他还活着
He's alive.

613
01:33:27,190 --> 01:33:28,550
我拿到了
I got it.

614
01:33:28,850 --> 01:33:30,660
他怎么样了?
How is he?

615
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:58,060
你的... 妈妈
Your... mother.

616
01:34:00,060 --> 01:34:01,930
弟弟
Brother.

617
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:04,440
安全吗?
Safe?

618
01:34:05,270 --> 01:34:07,860
暂时安全
For now.

619
01:34:15,910 --> 01:34:17,270
不
No.

620
01:34:17,370 --> 01:34:18,990
不
No.

621
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:24,670
不是人类
Not human.

622
01:34:28,420 --> 01:34:30,500
是科巴
Koba.

623
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:35,340
马尔科姆

624
01:34:35,590 --> 01:34:37,550
好
Yeah.

625
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:40,560
凯撒
Caesar.

626
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:44,350
我们现在要做手术
We need to do this now.

627
01:34:47,860 --> 01:34:49,860
儿子
Son.

628
01:35:24,140 --> 01:35:26,310
他怎么样了?
How is he?

629
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:30,150
还不知道
We'll see.

630
01:35:31,150 --> 01:35:33,650
他很强壮
He's very strong.

631
01:35:42,580 --> 01:35:45,080
会没事的
It's gonna be okay.

632
01:36:17,820 --> 01:36:20,360
对不起...
I'm so sorry...

633
01:36:20,780 --> 01:36:22,870
为所有的一切道歉
For everything.

634
01:36:23,950 --> 01:36:25,950
不
No.

635
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:31,190
我...
I...

636
01:36:31,290 --> 01:36:33,670
是我的错
am to blame.

637
01:36:35,130 --> 01:36:37,570
但科巴背叛了你
But Koba betrayed you.

638
01:36:37,670 --> 01:36:39,030
我...
I...

639
01:36:39,130 --> 01:36:43,260
选择了相信他...
chose to trust him...

640
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:48,020
因为他是猩猩
because he is ape.

641
01:36:48,690 --> 01:36:51,500
我总是以为...
I always think...

642
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:55,980
猩猩比人类好
ape better than human.

643
01:36:57,780 --> 01:37:00,360
我现在知道了...
I see now...

644
01:37:01,660 --> 01:37:06,540
我们和人类有多像
how much like them we are.

645
01:37:10,540 --> 01:37:13,380
科巴现在在哪?
Where Koba now?

646
01:37:14,790 --> 01:37:17,590
在人类的塔上...
On the human tower...

647
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:20,450
还有忠诚于他的猩猩
Loyal apes around him.

648
01:37:20,550 --> 01:37:24,450
那些不追随他的呢?
And those who not follow?

649
01:37:24,550 --> 01:37:26,930
成了阶下囚
Prisoners.

650
01:37:27,770 --> 01:37:29,640
毛里斯
Maurice.

651
01:37:29,810 --> 01:37:31,730
火箭
Rocket.

652
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:38,280
科巴杀了灰烬
Koba killed Ash.

653
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:46,780
其他猩猩出于害怕而追随他
Fear makes others follow.

654
01:37:48,830 --> 01:37:51,080
但是等他们看见你活着...
But when they see you alive...

655
01:37:52,170 --> 01:37:55,150
他们会从科巴那儿回到你身边
They will turn from Koba.

656
01:37:55,250 --> 01:37:57,550
如果我身体很弱 就不会了
Not if I am weak.

657
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:04,720
猩猩总是追随最强的人
Ape always seek strongest branch.

658
01:38:07,350 --> 01:38:11,770
我一定要阻止他
I must do something to stop him.

659
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:23,610
爸爸
Father.

660
01:38:25,780 --> 01:38:30,240
让我帮你

661

662
01:41:42,690 --> 01:41:43,760
好
Okay.

663
01:41:43,860 --> 01:41:46,230
凯撒 看

01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:42,370
抱歉 我不是有意打扰你

673
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:48,750
已经两天了
It's been two days.

674
01:42:54,340 --> 01:42:57,010
你儿子还没回来吗?
Your son is not back yet?

675
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:03,980

01:43:15,490 --> 01:43:18,320
像你一样
Like you.

679
01:43:48,650 --> 01:43:50,550
他们需要在不被看见的情况下进入塔内
They need to get to the tower without being seen.

680
01:43:50,650 --> 01:43:53,110
我会带他走地下通道
I'm gonna take him through the subway.

681
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:55,010
我爱你
I love you.

682
01:43:55,110 --> 01:43:58,430
科巴派手下去接母猿和孩子了

It's me! It's Malcolm! Don't shoot!

689

梯子... 爬梯子

690

695
01:45:20,660 --> 01:45:23,560
嘿! 看看我找到谁了

696
01:45:23,660 --> 01:45:25,810
我不知道你逃出来了

- What do you mean? What's going on? - The apes. They're all over the tower.

五磅的C-4炸弹

我们刚刚安装好
We just started setting them.

704
01:45:46,350 --> 01:45:49,310
它们会炸掉整座塔
They're gonna take down the whole tower.

705
01:45:51,020 --> 01:45:53,540
一次性把他们全炸掉

706
