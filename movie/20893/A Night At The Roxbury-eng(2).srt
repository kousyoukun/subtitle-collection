1
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,918
- Hi.
- Who, me? Him?

2
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:19,150
- Not you.
- Don't worry about it.

3
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,194
Hey!

4
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,953
- How are you doing?
- Oh, fuck off.

5
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,310
- What's up?
- Feel good. All right.

6
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,273
Excuse me.

7
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,875
- Yeah. Score.
- Very nice.

8
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,908
All right. Let's talk
to this little lady called Night.

9
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,479
I broke the window again.

10
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,468
- Dad's gonna be pissed.
- I'll just tell him you did it.

11
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,789
But I didn't do it.
I'm driving. Don't do that.

12
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,952
So anyways, I'm standing there,
waiting to use the pay phone...

13
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,632
And this guy on the phone turns
around and tips his hat like this.

14
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,150
And who do you think that guy was?

15
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,751
- Emilio Estevez.
- "The Mighty Duck". I was there!

16
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:20,398
Of course you were. You yelled
the "Breakfast Clubber's" name.

17
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,556
So, anyway.
You guys wanna make out or what?

18
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,959
Oh, man. It was perfect that time.

19
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,674
Four months of work for nothing.

20
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,236
- What's up?
- Did you know you were doing 50?

21
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:21,152
Hottie cop likes you. Think she pulls
over just anybody? Make a move.

22
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,668
- What's up?
- Just giving you an $80 ticket.

23
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,190
She is <i>so</i> into you.

24
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,273
- I want you to do me a favor.
- Whatever you say, "T.J. Hooker".

25
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,914
Please obey all posted speed limits.
Have a good night.

26
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,513
It's already been good, now
that you've served and protected me.

27
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,150
Way to go! You got her badge number.

28
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:05,550
And you got a date to meet her at
The Municipal State Court. Up top.

29
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,910
- What was the point of that?
- Sorry.

30
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,790
Come next week. I'm gonna
take care of you. All right, man.

31
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,719
This is the Roxbury. We have a list.

32
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,356
- We're on the list. Doug Butabi.
- Steve Butabi.

33
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,155
- You're brothers?
- No.

34
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,239
- Yes. Man!
- That's quite a joke.

35
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,557
- Doug is hilarious.
- Check this out.

36
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,754
You ever heard of this one?
You're not on the list. Get in line.

37
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,791
- Is that...?
- It's the king of "21 Jump Street".

38
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,629
Richard Grieco.

39
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,549
- Excuse me.
- See you later. We'll go wait in line.

40
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,513
- Maybe we'll hang out later?
- No chance.

41
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,352
- Sounds good.
- Know what's wrong with this place?

42
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,590
- They don't evaluate the clientele.
- I thought we just weren't cool enough.

43
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,750
You are a beautiful man. Know what
we're gonna do when we get our club?

44
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,717
We're gonna treat all wannabes just
as well as any legendary TV-star.

45
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,879
- That's pretty Roosevelt of you.
- It's just what I believe in.

46
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,232
- Wanna dance?
- We're not in the club yet.

47
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,194
So, maybe when we get in?

48
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:55,114
So I'm waiting to use the pay phone,
and this guy tips his hat like this.

49
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:00,030
- And who do you think that guy was?
- Emilio Estevez!

50
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,189
"The Mighty Duck", man. I swear
to God. I was, like, "Emilio!"

51
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,798
"Emilio...!"

52
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:18,030
The club is closed, folks. Sorry.

53
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,070
- Nozzled you, my friend.
- Totally got me.

54
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,509
That was in my nose.

55
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,109
- You're an idiot.
- Oh yeah? You like it.

56
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,949
Get off... Watch it!

57
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,708
Where's Mom? And who's this
gorgeous young hottie in the kitchen?

58
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:20,711
- Why is she wearing Mom's bathrobe?
- What do you think of my new chin?

59
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,912
Is it better than last year's?

60
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,511
Behave yourselves. Look who's
gracing us with their presence.

61
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,236
- Who?
- Here, Dad.

62
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,797
It's a health shake.
It helps me hit my physical peak.

63
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,436
Get the camera.
He's gonna hit his peak.

64
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,589
- Honey, do it in your room.
- Oh, Mom, you're so funny.

65
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:51,511
Steve? In the store in a half hour.
Wear something nice. Emily's back.

66
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,077
As if he gives a flying rat's ass.

67
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,352
"Flying rat's ass..."
That would be wild to see.

68
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:05,430
Steve, at the store in a half hour.
Bring your dancing monkey brother.

69
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,476
Hey, are you from out of town?
You have a local number?

70
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,232
Are you all right? Sure?

71
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:31,599
Finally. An hour and a half late.
Steve, go dust the roses.

72
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,509
Idiot boy,
go cover the cash register.

73
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,872
Idiot boy,
go cover the cash register.

74
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,869
Hi. How are you paying for these?
Cash, check or charge?

75
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,469
- Charge.
- Okay.

76
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,595
- Is this a Visa or a Mastercard?
- Move your thumb.

77
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,598
Good one. Okay.

78
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:11,231
Sure this is your card? It's not
processing. I have to call it in.

79
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,678
- Operator 238, please.
- Authorization. Card number?

80
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,475
- What's up?
- I told you not to call anymore.

81
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,309
- I need an approval.
- Card number?

82
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:37,356
- Not the card, sweetness, me.
- Shut up and swipe it.

83
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,996
I can go for that.

84
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,751
You like that? Does that feel good?
'Cause I can swipe it all night.

85
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,998
- The card's fine. Bye, Doug.
- Bye, 238.

86
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,030
Hi. Can I help you?

87
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,836
Hi, Doug. Your nightclub's so cool.
Can my model friends come in?

88
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,237
- No. Yes.
- You're so funny and cute and tall.

89
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,795
Let's shake it.

90
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,870
What are you doing? You have to cut up
my plants and make toys of them?

91
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,959
- It's a club with a jungle theme.
- You're a jungle theme.

92
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,278
Go find your brother and load
the trucks. Idiot... Useless!

93
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,030
- Steve...?
- Don't look.

94
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,710
- Hi, Steve. Hey, Doug.
- Whatever.

95
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:48,711
So, you're back from school, working
for your dad at the lamp store?

96
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,198
I missed you. You said when I
got back, we could get together.

97
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,790
Now I'm back,
so we can get together.

98
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,754
- You wanna go see a movie?
- Sure.

99
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:07,672
Or we could just drive around
and make out. I love making out.

100
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,391
- And I'm really good at it.
- Sounds good.

101
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:18,869
Back off, Chicklett. My brother and
I, we live life in the fast lane.

102
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,993
That means no stop signs,
no pulling over to take pictures.

103
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,432
See this man? He's my co-pilot
on this magic carpet ride.

104
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:32,873
- You're just way too much luggage.
- Shut up, Doug.

105
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,359
Emily?
I see you've picked the right son.

106
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,348
You know, Steve likes you very much.

107
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:50,113
Mr. Butabi. Is Steve asking Emily
to marry him again?

108
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,029
You know something?
If they have enough children, -

109
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,959
- we won't have to hire salesmen.

110
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:02,678
- Oh, Kamehl, you kill me.
- No, you kill me, Mr. Sanderson.

111
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:09,592
- Can you please leave Steve alone?
- He likes the girl... Yes, you do!

112
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,794
You see this wall? After they
get married, we'll combine stores -

113
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,754
- and have the first plant-lamp
shop. Steve and Emily will run it.

114
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:27,231
- Maybe you can clean the toilets.
- You're living on "Fantasy Island".

115
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,750
- God, that was a sweet show.
- I have a fantasy.

116
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:35,875
That I have two capable sons.
Not one with his head up his ass!

117
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:42,519
Is this how you load trucks?
Disgusting. Get out of here.

118
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,548
- So we're on a break?
- I guess.

119
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:54,357
- You wanna crunch it?
- Sure. Let's crunch.

120
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,838
- Can the rest of us use the mirror?
- Appreciate it.

121
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,272
- Everyone's got an attitude here.
- Gentlemen! Looking large.

122
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,314
Want my power bar?
How about an energy bar?

123
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:17,277
- I got a muscle triplicator bar.
- Supplements aside...

124
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,268
- How long have we been friends?
- All seven years of high school.

125
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:28,955
That's why I'm not gonna sugar coat
it. I'm worried about your triceps.

126
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,109
You aren't going all the way down.
I'm not seeing full extension.

127
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,791
We had a long talk about that
the other night.

128
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,473
You just shouldn't cheat yourselves.
Sorry to come down on you like this.

129
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,956
That's why we love you and hate you.

130
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,277
- Still friends?
- You know it.

131
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,552
I'm glad we had this talk.

132
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,311
I had a great idea for the store...

133
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:20,516
The store? You're supposed to be
thinking about... Hey, what's up?

134
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,032
- Can we call you sometime?
- Want some of this?

135
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,392
- Think about our future.
- You're Mount St. Helensing on me.

136
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,512
Why are you forgetting our plans?

137
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,396
The plans about you and I opening up
only the coolest club a la the Roxbury.

138
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:44,119
- How? We can't even get in.
- We're letting them not let us in.

139
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,394
But no more. It's time we step up
into that sweet-ass world.

140
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,913
From now on, the only club
we're going to is the Roxbury.

141
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,918
- We can't...
- We can. You know why?

142
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:03,035
- We're good looking?
- Very good looking. You especially.

143
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,631
Repeat after me:
We can get into the Roxbury.

144
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:12,311
We can get into the Roxbury.

145
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,035
Roxbury...!

146
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:25,310
Hey, what's up? You want some
of this? How about a little of that?

147
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:33,513
She starts to smell them.
She thought they were real plants!

148
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,875
- Hello?
- What's up?

149
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,870
The Sandersons are here to see
your mother's new chin. Get dressed.

150
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,279
- Sorry, we're a bit busy tonight.
- Steve? I'll be right back.

151
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:54,793
I like your bathing suit. You have
really good muscle definition.

152
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,710
Most Americans don't wear revealing
bathing suits. Very European of you.

153
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:05,392
It's really sexy and I have
a really good taste in what's sexy.

154
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,036
- Steve!
- Whatever, Emily.

155
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,477
Good.

156
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,194
What's going on...?

157
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,356
Are you from out of town...?

158
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:13,239
When I tell you to do something,
I mean it. Never come in half-naked.

159
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,116
- Put some clothes on and come down.
- Isn't on our things-to-do-list.

160
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,075
- We have something to do tonight.
- Yes. To get downstairs.

161
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,716
I don't want to!

162
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,669
How do I get through
to this individual?

163
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,997
Doug is like a fax machine.

164
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,194
Without a cover page, people don't
know where it's coming from.

165
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,599
And sometimes you get a busy signal.
That's why you got a redial button.

166
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:51,511
- Actually, I always screw it up...
- Don't bother. He'll never understand.

167
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:58,353
I understand very well. You're going
to a new, hot club tonight, right?

168
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:03,429
- But how are you gonna get there?
- What are you doing?

169
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,798
You can take away our phones
and our keys, but <i>not</i> our dreams.

170
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,073
'Cos we're, like, sleeping
when we have them.

171
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,669
Later much!

172
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:50,319
Boys, wait. I don't like you leaving
without a phone.

173
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,273
How old are these? How embarrassing.

174
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,758
You know, in case of emergency.
Have fun.

175
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,919
- Did Mom get lipstick on me?
- It looks like you were making out.

176
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,630
- How's my hair? Roxbury-good?
- You know it.

177
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:23,118
I've got to tell you, Steve,
tonight, I can taste it.

178
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,789
I can't taste it. I'm so scared right now.
I don't know what to do.

179
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,312
- You're mad-cowing on me. Relax.
- I'm nervous.

180
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:40,516
- It's this pressure to get in.
- You must take control of yourself.

181
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,599
No, <i>you</i> take control.
I'm barely hanging on here.

182
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:51,868
Come on, relax. Think puppies
and candy canes, all right?

183
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:57,552
- Hey, hotlegs. What's going on?
- We'll clean it up later. Don't worry.

184
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:05,357
I see your Roxbury balloon
and I hate to burst it, -

185
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:10,839
- but I don't think
our names are on that list.

186
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,996
Perfect. "Rites of Passage".

187
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,228
Remember? A boy in the jungle
with only a spear to hunt the lion.

188
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,353
This van is our spear.
That Roxbury is our lion.

189
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,314
- Does the bouncer know about this?
- He's about to find out.

190
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,239
See you next week.

191
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,150
- My good <i>hombre</i>. Remember us?
- Doug and Steve Butabi.

192
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,592
- You're brothers?
- No... Yes.

193
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,758
- Man!
- Works every time.

194
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,918
Now I remember. You can't come in.

195
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,630
What's up, partner?
How are you doing tonight?

196
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,674
Time to play a little softball.

197
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:01,432
- Hey, good man. How's it going?
- Good. You still can't come in.

198
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:06,794
That's not what my friend told me.
His name is Abraham.

199
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,155
- You don't know him?
- What about his two friends?

200
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:19,117
George Washington
and George Washington?

201
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:27,990
And George Washington is a little
lonely. Wants to join his buddies.

202
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:33,479
And look who else we've got.
Roosevelt, Roosevelt and Jefferson.

203
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,112
Thanks... Great.

204
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:46,157
- Is that an ATM?
- That's where we drop off videos.

205
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,670
- Hello, that's it.
- That was a card store.

206
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:55,432
- That's just Weight Watchers...
- ATM. That's it.

207
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,837
- Shit. The car.
- What about me?

208
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,589
This racing car is illegal.
All I need is a police report.

209
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,593
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, let me see.

210
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:22,876
Great. They're starting
with the neck injuries. I'm screwed.

211
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,514
Jesus, man.

212
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:30,111
- Sorry about your van.
- No way. Richard Grieco!

213
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:37,876
- We saw you at the Roxbury.
- Right. So what do you want to do?

214
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,676
- Go to the Roxbury again.
- We couldn't get in.

215
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:49,479
You want me to get you
into the Roxbury? Great. Follow me.

216
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,358
- Amazing.
- It all comes from within.

217
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,677
He felt it because he's an actor.

218
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:03,068
We gotta make a stop at the Roxbury.
I just don't want a lawsuit.

219
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:22,159
Oh, my God, this is the most
amazing place I've ever been.

220
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,194
This is the coatroom.
The club's in there.

221
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,556
What's up...?

222
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,956
- Get a hold of yourself.
- It's hottie overload in here.

223
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:44,312
- Just pace yourself.
- What's up? Two, three, four.

224
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:48,229
What's up? Two, three, four...

225
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,874
- Sweet!
- Sweet!

226
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,958
Richie, good to see you. Get over here.

227
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:04,110
- The place is kicking.
- Jumping like "21 Jump Street".

228
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,880
Who are your friends?

229
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,517
- Mr. Zadir owns the place.
- Doug Butabi.

230
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,589
You look like good boys.
Come to my VIP table.

231
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,360
- The owner.
- The man we want to be.

232
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:24,031
- I thought we wanted to be Grieco.
- Professionally, it's this guy.

233
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:33,358
Dooey, my main man. I love
this man. Meet the Butabi brothers.

234
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:39,157
These are good boys.
Did you grab my ass?

235
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,353
- No, sir. I did not grab your ass.
- It's okay if you did.

236
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:48,350
I understand. It's just that
you're barking up the wrong tree.

237
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,996
- You guys come here a lot?
- All the time.

238
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,875
- But we've never been inside.
- Watch what you're saying.

239
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,356
So, is Johnny Depp meeting you here?

240
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,474
No.

241
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:13,789
All right... Listen, Bennie,
see you later. See you, guys.

242
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,595
- See you, Richard Grieco.
- See you, Grieco's lady.

243
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:26,035
I'm honored to shoot the shit with
the owner of the club of all clubs.

244
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,678
- And we're proficient club hoppers.
- We usually go to the Mudd Club.

245
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,190
- That place is rank.
- They let any asswad in the door.

246
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,552
- I own that place also.
- It's a really good location, though.

247
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:46,108
No, you're right. One day
you're hot, the next day you're not.

248
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,713
Actually, I had an idea for a club.

249
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:57,232
- Wait. Did you grab my ass?
- No.

250
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,355
- Do you want to?
- No. Should I?

251
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,190
Okay. Continue.

252
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:13,635
People waiting outside are bummed,
'cos they're trying to get in.

253
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,833
What if the outside of the club
looked like the inside?

254
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:23,319
With couches and music and all that.
But then on the inside...

255
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,559
...it looks like the street.
You know, cars and signs.

256
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,197
The outside is the inside
and the inside is the outside.

257
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,789
Doesn't that blow your mind?

258
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:40,391
- What about that guy?
- Owns a restaurant. One.

259
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:46,470
- Boy, has this place gone downhill.
- No one over six figures. Let's go.

260
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,798
- Wait. That's that Zadir guy.
- Who are those guys with him?

261
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,073
If they're with Zadir,
they've got to be worth something.

262
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,477
Great. Let's work.

263
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,878
- Tell him about the vampire idea.
- That's a dumb idea.

264
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,389
I have to say hello to Jim Carrey.

265
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,831
Come here,
you pet detective bastard.

266
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:13,556
"Smoking", you crazy son of a bitch.

267
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,550
- Was I too pushy? Did I speak well?
- You were totally articulate.

268
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:23,788
It's hard to pitch in a nightclub.
The music is way too loud in here.

269
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,436
We have to get a meeting. Steve...?

270
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,348
- You want to dance?
- Yes.

271
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:47,633
- All right. Take it easy.
- She said yes.

272
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,957
Hotties wanna shake it. Come on.

273
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,791
That's some good ass-grabbing
going on there.

274
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,957
1980. Good year.

275
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,630
Excellent year. Devo had a huge hit.

276
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:20,428
- And "Joanie Loves Chachi" started.
- Chachi gives a fuck about Joanie.

277
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,873
Cambi makes a good point.
But tonight we have some fun.

278
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,234
- Sweet suds, Mr. Zadir.
- But you know what makes a party?

279
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,796
- Fluffy whip.
- But not putting it on stuff.

280
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,552
You press the little white nozzle
and you suck on it. It's fun.

281
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:46,517
- You mean, like, nitrous oxide?
- No. What is that?

282
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,952
Dooey, we have to stop and get
some fluffy whip for the party.

283
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,709
- Yes, sir.
- It has to be in a can.

284
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,036
He can't hear you.

285
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:01,518
Hey, Dooey, tell your mom
I had a nice time last night.

286
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,598
- And your dad.
- What?

287
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,992
- I mean, your sister.
- Good one!

288
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,510
- Only in a Limo.
- We nailed him.

289
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:17,030
Disco-dicks.

290
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:23,631
- And that alien was Robin Williams.
- I'll be right back.

291
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,231
- It's my boss's card.
- I'll take care of that.

292
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:36,232
- Operator 238, please.
- Hello, Doug.

293
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:42,515
- Guess where we went tonight.
- The One-Stop Market on Ventura?

294
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,713
No, I mean before that,
you sly, little credit vixen.

295
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:50,993
I give up, you nasty card-swiper.

296
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,149
- The Roxbury. Come out some time.
- I would.

297
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,909
But then who would approve
all the money you spend?

298
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:05,990
- You're always thinking of me.
- The card's good. Bye, Doug.

299
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,874
She approved. Approved.

300
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,717
- Sweet-ass dwelling, Mr. Zadir.
- It's a place to hang my hat.

301
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:38,471
Look. A hundred thousand dollar
sound system, and nobody's dancing.

302
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:43,913
If I may congest, the pool is taking
up the prime dancing real estate.

303
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:50,559
If you put glass over the pool,
it would be like dancing on water.

304
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,992
- And people love to do that.
- Let's not talk business now.

305
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,192
Let's set up a meeting.

306
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,757
Anna Nicole? Put something on.
You're making us sick.

307
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,155
Meeting!

308
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,636
- Let's mingle.
- Right.

309
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:13,152
This Italian food tastes so good.
It's, like, Mexican.

310
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,557
- Could you pass me a towel, please?
- Good. How are you?

311
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:22,073
- They're right behind you.
- BMW... Vanilla, mostly.

312
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,795
- There you are.
- We got scared.

313
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,549
- Of who? We'll kick his ass.
- No.

314
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,991
We got scared
somebody stole you away from us.

315
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,034
Oh, okay.

316
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,710
Like some other girls
would steal us away...

317
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,755
Oh, right. Oh!

318
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,233
So, do you guys wanna go some place
we can be alone?

319
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:56,877
No... Yes! Oh, man.

320
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:02,279
- Why does it taste so sweet?
- 'Cos it's like candy.

321
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,639
These are real.
They'll be dead in a week.

322
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:16,193
You know what I always thought
would make a cool "Twilight Zone"?

323
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,109
Like, we see a picture
of this lady, -

324
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:26,077
- but to this lady, are we just
a picture of us? Ever think of that?

325
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,748
No.

326
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,236
Why don't you come over here?

327
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,718
Vivica, you know what I heard
when I first met you?

328
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,150
What?

329
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,757
- What are you doing?
- That's an ambulance.

330
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,034
Coming to take me away.
The sight of you stopped my heart.

331
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:01,753
Cambi, do you like blueberries
or strawberries?

332
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:07,034
I wanna know what kind of pancakes
to order you in the morning.

333
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,789
Steve!

334
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,799
- I was wondering...
- What are you doing?

335
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,279
Checking your label.
Just as I thought. Made in heaven.

336
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,472
Doug. You've gotten past
the opening lines.

337
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:34,676
- Is that a mirror in your pocket?
- What?

338
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,793
I could see myself in your pants.

339
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,915
If I said you had a nice body,
would you hold it against me?

340
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:53,835
I was there. I was, like, "Emilio!"
And Doug was going cra...

341
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:59,398
And Steve was, like, "Emilio!"
Oh, God, if you were only there.

342
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:04,355
I feel like a selfish pig, going on
about myself. What about you?

343
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,599
Where are you from?
Any brothers or sisters? Any family?

344
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,439
- Pets, what about pets?
- I got a cat.

345
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,871
Really? A cat? Interesting.

346
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:20,313
I think of you more as a dog person.
Maybe a Pomeranian. Lhasa Apso.

347
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:25,196
Something small, warm, fuzzy...

348
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,789
Is this your first time?

349
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,470
Yes. Isn't it yours?

350
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:37,075
- Is this your first time?
- What?

351
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,831
Are you serious?
Oh, you're hilarious.

352
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:49,674
Oh, man. You're funny.
Hey, Steve? You're a funny girl.

353
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:54,078
All right. Hey, where are you going?

354
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:04,192
- Oh, my God.
- Did you just? 'Cos I just...

355
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:14,520
Not that it hasn't happened before.
It was okay.

356
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,315
I'm gonna go back in and...

357
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,398
- Hey, Steve?
- Yeah, Doug?

358
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:36,108
- You got a number.
- We got a number.

359
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:49,039
I got some great office supplies
for our new nightclub business.

360
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,391
Post-It notes to annotate important
documents.

361
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:57,151
Little ones. You write smaller than
me. Mugs with our names on them.

362
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:01,069
Yours say Doug.
Did you call Mr. Zadir?

363
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,308
Before you talk to a man like Mr. Zadir,
you have to have a plan of attack.

364
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:11,674
I'd like to schedule a meeting.
Can you do... 12:30?

365
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,872
Let me see.

366
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,879
- I'm clear.
- You know what?

367
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:26,039
Let's have a pre-meeting
to brainstorm before our meeting.

368
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:31,837
Yeah, that way we don't
look like idiots at our meeting.

369
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,557
- I'm sorry. Register's closed.
- Sorry.

370
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:44,555
Mr. Butabi,
where's the other cash register?

371
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:52,949
Steve? I was just thinking. Dad
would be really proud of us right now.

372
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:59,190
What are you idiots doing? I pay you
to take money and push a button.

373
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,153
Are your delicate fingers injured?

374
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:06,558
- We're working our asses off.
- Our week's filling up quick.

375
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,116
We've made
important business contacts.

376
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,517
Dancing the Macarena
with Donald Trump?

377
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,998
You're always telling us
to do something with our lives.

378
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:23,274
You never support us or care about
what's important to us, right?

379
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:28,508
- Yeah... for the most part.
- Even your brother isn't convinced.

380
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:34,716
Why? He uses his brain, unlike you.
You're a loser! New policy.

381
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:40,677
No more clubs.
Yes! Your life is retail.

382
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,952
- Go clean the stockroom.
- You know what?

383
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,871
Not only will we not clean out
the stockroom, we're out of here!

384
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,516
What about the stockroom?

385
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,916
We don't need you.
We made huge-ass contacts last night.

386
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:01,795
Plus we met these girls, Dad.

387
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,959
We'll make it without you.
You'll see.

388
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:11,154
I'll see when you come home, begging
for food and shelter. Morons!

389
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:17,230
Steve? You're an ass, Doug.
You want to go to the beach later?

390
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,433
I know a beach where you don't have
to wear a bathing suit.

391
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:26,316
- Plus with my milky white skin...
- This is a major family crisis.

392
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,637
I have to take
a rain check on this convo.

393
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,870
Nice bulbs, Emily. And I don't
mean that metaphorically.

394
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:42,152
Just give me a call if you wanna
go out. Or just call me anyway.

395
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,473
You notice we forgot to ask her
something. That's weird.

396
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:29,879
We're in serious relationships right
now, and our ladies can trust us.

397
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:35,552
Why go out for burgers,
when you got steak at home?

398
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,152
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, fine.

399
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,113
- Doug and Steve Butabi.
- You're brothers?

400
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:57,429
- We can't get into that right now.
- Your names are not on the list.

401
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,835
We have a meeting.

402
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:04,750
- Doug, Mr. Zadir!
- Security.

403
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:11,632
- Dooey... Yeah. Up top.
- Main man.

404
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:16,914
- Raging party last night.
- Is that what my mother told you?

405
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,874
- What?
- The fluffy whip was a big hit.

406
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:26,154
- I was sent out looking for more.
- You, sir, are a party animal.

407
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:30,751
It's been great spending quality
time, but we're meeting Mr. Zadir.

408
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,272
Zadir was drunk last night.
He doesn't even remember you.

409
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:39,473
You think you're the first losers
I've had to get rid of on a Monday?

410
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:44,800
- Are we being blown off?
- Actually, you're being kicked out.

411
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:58,194
That doesn't feel good at all...

412
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,356
- What's going on?
- Just some trespassers.

413
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:09,271
- And the boys from last night?
- I haven't located them yet.

414
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,836
Dooey, did you just grab my ass?

415
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:17,033
From where I'm standing,
that's a physical impossibility.

416
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:21,233
I know your tricks, Dooey.

417
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,318
Maybe we should just go back to work.

418
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:41,310
Maybe we should go to college, not
put gel in our hair and wear jeans!

419
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,832
- Let's do that, Steve!
- Sorry.

420
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,672
Cambi's number.

421
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:00,750
- We had a pretty sweet time, right?
- Sweet-ass time.

422
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,715
Diabetic.
I could see us doing that again.

423
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,549
Maybe even a couple of times a week.

424
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,753
The ladies await, my friend. Cell.

425
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:19,713
So you do travel to places
other than Japan.

426
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,390
- These hotties are sweet.
- Sweet ass sweet.

427
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:29,199
- Who is it?
- Just a bunch of pound signs.

428
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:33,712
- Are you doing it right?
- You have to hit the pound sign.

429
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:40,635
You have to put in our number
and then hit the pound sign.

430
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,837
Excuse me, Bill Nye, the science guy.

431
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:49,476
That's a sweet show, too.

432
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:58,070
Cambi, it's your boyfriend.
Look, I need to see you.

433
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:01,829
- I'm at the Skybar.
- <i>We'll be right there.</i>

434
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:06,795
- Nice.
- I was focused the whole time.

435
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,470
Did you have a good time last night?

436
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:14,673
I had a great time.
I think we've reached a point -

437
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,714
- where I can call you Viv
and leave out the "ica".

438
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:23,391
You wanna hang out
or do what we did last night?

439
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:27,957
- Or eat, then do what we did?
- Sounds good.

440
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:34,993
- Have your boarding passes ready.
- You'll have to check your bag.

441
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:42,311
The movie on this flight will be...
I can't think of any more.

442
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:49,198
- Where's your car?
- Our dad got mad, took it away.

443
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:55,111
We used to work for him, but we quit
today. Actually, we're unemployed.

444
00:47:55,320 --> 00:48:00,269
- You don't work with Mr. Zadir?
- We just met him last night.

445
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:06,874
- We will be. So no, but yes.
- If we ever get to see him again.

446
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:15,555
- You don't need boarding passes.
- Get away from us.

447
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,548
- You guys are a big waste of time.
- <i>Como</i> what?

448
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:24,709
- Steve, you're a jerkoff.
- I'm glad you shared that with me.

449
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:29,710
- It's a big step for both of us.
- Consider last night a favor.

450
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,390
Now do us a favor.
Never talk to us again!

451
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:37,115
- What did we do? We'll change.
- You can't change.

452
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:40,756
You are ugly, pathetic losers.

453
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,795
I can't believe we actually had sex
with these asswads!

454
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,472
That's the problem. Poor <i>schmucks</i>
look just the same as rich <i>schmucks</i>.

455
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:08,633
- No... Yes...
- This is the worst day of my life.

456
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:12,389
I'd really appreciate it
if you didn't talk to me right now.

457
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,876
I don't know how to respond to that.

458
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:22,918
Big surprise. You don't know how to
work the clubs, talk to the ladies.

459
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:27,511
You only know how to ask me
how to do everything!

460
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:31,713
That's why everything has gone
wrong. You're holding me back.

461
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:40,555
You're like this thing tied to my
leg, this dragging thing on a chain.

462
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:44,389
- A lead weight?
- Yes, thank you. But not anymore!

463
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,956
Nothing. That's all. Nothing.

464
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:53,837
You can't blame me. Today was just
a series of random events gone awry.

465
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:59,592
Maybe they wouldn't go awry
if I had someone next to me with a brain!

466
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:05,432
You know what? Dad was right.
You are a loser.

467
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:11,158
You know what, Steve?
I lied. You're not good looking.

468
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:16,150
Did you say something? I can't hear
things from that low to the ground.

469
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:20,672
- Consider me your ex-brother.
- I don't care.

470
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,634
Care about this?
You want the real thing?

471
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:27,354
- Do you want...?
- Stop talking to me.

472
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,949
Fine. My pleasure.

473
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:17,832
Little Post-Its, you little idiot.

474
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:21,032
Get out, 'cos I hate you.

475
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:33,599
- <i>You should take a lesson from it.</i>
- Grieco.

476
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,154
- You'll be very happy with these.
- How long do they last?

477
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:09,309
They last forever. They're silk.
They'll always be in bloom.

478
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:15,231
They'll never die, never change.
Never say you're not good looking.

479
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:22,073
They'll always be in your room, not
suddenly move to the guest house.

480
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:26,193
Something has come up. Excuse me.

481
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:32,111
- All the customers are depressed.
- It's just that I miss Doug.

482
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:36,996
- He's in the guest house. It's a mansion.
- There's no cable.

483
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:42,593
- Yes, there is. They have Cinemax.
- But there's no HBO. God!

484
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:50,111
- Feel it right here. Squeeze.
- Hey, Steve.

485
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:53,551
I heard about your brother.

486
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:59,153
- So when are we gonna go out?
- I know a place with spinach wraps.

487
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:04,514
I know you've had you heart set on
this, but the truth is, I'm a rebel.

488
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:08,429
You're like this
sweet-girl-from-next-door type.

489
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:15,512
I go to college. Translation: Drunken
orgies with occasional Cliff notes.

490
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:20,635
It sounds good, but I just got out
of this very serious relationship.

491
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:24,469
I have to nurse my emotional wounds.

492
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:28,309
That could take till... Saturday.

493
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:33,594
That's perfect. Your dad got us tickets
for David Copperfield this Saturday.

494
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:39,989
It's gonna be so much fun
to see things appear and disappear.

495
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,990
I'll see you.

496
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:56,558
- Oh, man. Great glutes.
- I don't care.

497
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,631
- That's expensive.
- Gotta go.

498
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:31,473
Who decorates like this?
Steve, come on.

499
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:08,677
"Business. Human Relationships
in Management."

500
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,952
"Covers the development of..."

501
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:16,995
Here's one. "Business Computer
Systems." That's a good one.

502
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:22,399
Machines are Doug's thing.
I'm more of a people person.

503
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:29,039
A business man must have knowledge
of computers. Come on.

504
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:33,518
Here's another one.
"Venture Management."

505
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:39,192
Gosh, Emily, school?
I'll have to read, and homework...

506
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:43,837
Teachers saying: "Would you share
that with the rest of the class?"

507
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,634
Do you want me to be less horny?

508
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:51,914
- No, that wouldn't be good.
- Look, here's what we do.

509
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:57,990
First, we combine the stores, okay?
Then we can add the furniture.

510
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,431
Recliners and sofa beds...

511
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:05,315
- And end tables and...
- Chairs.

512
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:10,389
- Oh, yes, chairs.
- Ottomans.

513
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:16,516
Yes, ottomans. We're gonna be bigger
than Ikea... Home Depot.

514
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:24,389
Ikea!

515
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:38,794
I think we're moving way too fast.
You're talking like we're married.

516
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:45,558
Oh, Steve.
You just made me so happy.

517
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:49,639
What? No, I don't mean that.

518
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:53,833
It's just that I don't...

519
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,996
Okay.

520
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:17,756
Doug, if I'm not mistaken,
this place has got it going on!

521
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:21,270
I owe you big time for inviting me.

522
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:26,998
Who wants to dance?
I call this one the sprinkler.

523
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:33,754
You think it would be okay to wear
this to your brother's wedding?

524
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:38,317
Your brother's wedding, man.
What are you gonna wear?

525
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:43,397
You have to hand it to Steve.
That Emily is the perfect woman.

526
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:48,310
Strong legs, tight stomach,
positive mental attitude...

527
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:55,517
- She can really keep you on track.
- Shut up...! Idiot.

528
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:01,068
Just because you and your brother
are having problems, -

529
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:06,752
- that's no reason to refer to my
intellect in a diminutive manner.

530
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:11,511
I'm sorry. It's just...

531
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:15,793
Can we not talk
about my brother for a second?

532
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,278
- 10-4. Boundary set.
- Thank you.

533
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:24,951
I'm having a hell of a time.

534
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,915
At this moment, I want to make
a toast to Steve and Emily, -

535
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:41,193
- who after tomorrow
will be Mr. and Mrs. Steven Butabi.

536
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:45,075
- Emily Sanderson-Butabi.
- Whoever.

537
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:53,392
I would like to thank my parents,
who came in all the way from Maine.

538
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:58,116
- Despite Mom's sciatica.
- Terrific, sir.

539
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:04,150
And the Butabis, who came in
all the way from Yayman.

540
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:09,354
- Yemen.
- And that's not the only union.

541
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:15,032
- We got a new lamp-plant store.
- Plant-lamp store. Much better.

542
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:19,950
- Seriously, it sounds better.
- Steve?

543
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,628
You want to make a toast?

544
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:26,310
I think you should make a toast.
All the men are making toasts.

545
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:36,915
Okay, I just want to say,
"What's up, Grandma, Grandpa?"

546
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:41,671
And to the other two old people,
"What's up?"

547
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:45,509
- Yeah, you.
- Very nice.

548
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:50,555
Steve is thrilled
that this family's coming together.

549
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:57,552
I'd like to show you some of our
business plans for after the merger.

550
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:05,754
Dad? Is there any way
we can cancel this whole thing?

551
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:11,432
- Yes... No!
- That is <i>so</i> funny.

552
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:16,555
But it's like Emily turned out to be
this whole different other person.

553
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:19,069
Let me explain something.

554
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:23,751
The caterer has been paid.
Your grandparents came.

555
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:28,799
All men are nervous
the night before their wedding.

556
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:35,599
All guys are nervous and kind of
hope she eats a can of botulism?

557
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:40,669
She could hang out with a deer and
accidentally be shot by a hunter.

558
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:45,192
You know, when she's sleeping she
makes that nose whistle sound, -

559
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:50,599
- and you want to ram her toothbrush
up her nostril into her skull.

560
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:55,989
These are perfectly normal feelings.

561
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:08,553
Doug, are you there? It's Steve.

562
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:22,515
Hi, you've reached Doug Butabi.
I'm outside living it up.

563
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:25,154
Unlike my pussywhipped brother -

564
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:30,388
- who's too busy throwing his life away
for Emily. Beep.

565
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:36,038
Doug? Sorry I missed you.
I guess I'm getting married -

566
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:41,268
- and I'm just wondering
if you wanted to be my best man.

567
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,596
Give me a call or page me.

568
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:48,476
I'm in our room still
across from the pool.

569
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:50,955
See you.

570
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:02,756
- Let's go over this one more time.
- I know my duties as best man.

571
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:07,158
I walk down the aisle.
I stand next to you.

572
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:11,558
- I settle interwedding skirmishes.
- No, no...

573
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:17,995
You're the best man. Not the wedding
bouncer. You just back me up.

574
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:22,591
Like, if things get too heavy,
I step in like a spotter.

575
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:25,792
- Yeah, right.
- Thanks, man.

576
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:31,677
Let's go. We're ready, let's go.

577
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:35,316
Do you want your kid blessed or not?

578
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:43,471
- Richard Grieco. You know Steve?
- I just don't want to be sued.

579
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:48,515
No, listen to me. You can't get your
kid confirmed for less than $150.

580
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:52,156
You want your kid blessed,
you call me.

581
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:59,630
Dad, I didn't have a bachelor party.
That's a major part of a wedding.

582
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:04,960
So could we delay a couple of hours
so that we could go to a strip club?

583
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:08,914
I have to go. Leave me a message.

584
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,796
Hey... Steve getting married.
You're the man!

585
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:20,279
Shut up, Craig. I'm walking
down the aisle, you dick!

586
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:25,952
I told you to wear white.
Grandma, get off the phone.

587
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:43,309
Dearly beloved. We're gathered
here today to join...

588
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:48,071
Did we already start? Oh.

589
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:53,434
I thought there was supposed
to be a buzzer or a whistle or something.

590
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:56,871
...to join together this man
and this woman in holy matrimony.

591
01:03:57,080 --> 01:04:02,438
But first I understand the bride and
groom have each prepared something.

592
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:10,079
"Dear Steve. They say if you set
something free and it comes back -

593
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:14,193
- you should love it forever.
Like one of your silk plants, -

594
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:19,997
- I'll try to stay beautiful. I know
our lives together will be great."

595
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:24,034
"Just like when we saw David
Copperfield on our first date."

596
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,390
"Love Emily."

597
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:38,635
"I used to see you outside
my father's store -

598
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:45,552
- and then we went on some dates
and you let me have sex with you."

599
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:54,357
Oh, I'm done.

600
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:59,076
If anyone has reason to believe
that this man or woman -

601
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:04,308
- should not be married, speak now
or forever hold your peace.

602
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:10,390
- What's up? From out of town?
- Don't hit on the bridesmaid.

603
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:16,118
- It's your wedding.
- Wait till after the ceremony.

604
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:22,593
Do you promise to love Emily for
as long as you both shall live?

605
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:26,918
My dad already paid the caterer.

606
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:33,719
Do you promise to love Steven for
as long as you both shall live?

607
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:37,310
- Steven, repeat after me.
- After me.

608
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:48,519
- With this ring, I thee wed.
- With this ring, I thee wed.

609
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:53,993
Now, Emily.

610
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:57,948
With this ring...

611
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:09,517
Doug!

612
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:16,195
- What the hell's he doing here?
- Make him stop.

613
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,517
Turn that music off!

614
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:24,589
You know
what I paid for this wedding?

615
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:29,749
Don't do that with your head.
That's so dumb!

616
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:33,509
- Mr. Butabi, I can't...
- Keep going. You want to get paid?

617
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:40,671
- You're out of my will!
- I told you he was a jerk!

618
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:55,398
Emily... Sorry. I'm not ready yet.

619
01:06:55,600 --> 01:07:00,355
- Steve, stop!
- Nice poem, though. Sorry, Dad.

620
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:06,396
Steve, come back here!
Don't you leave me. I'm not kidding.

621
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:12,197
Mr. Butabi, as an actor and observer
of human nature, I can tell you -

622
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,915
- that your son is not ready
for this sort of commitment.

623
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:23,232
- Hello.
- Hey.

624
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:33,631
- Go ahead, Father.
- What are you doing?

625
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:39,198
Emily, Steve's discipline is lacking
as is his appreciation for you.

626
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:45,669
Now, I can bench press 305 pound,
and my body fat is less than 2%.

627
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:53,316
I am a professional trainer. I also
hope to market my own protein bar.

628
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:57,229
Plus, I've always loved you.

629
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:04,354
Okay. But we should
look into infomercials.

630
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:09,759
- This is a completely new fee. Cool?
- Yeah.

631
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:16,676
Okay. Dearly beloved,
we're gathered here again today...

632
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:23,590
Also, I took Craig clubbing.

633
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:26,792
That was all right.

634
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,879
Plus I rented a lot of videos.
I didn't do much else.

635
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,988
Look, Steve...

636
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:47,079
I'm sorry.
I said a lot of bad things before.

637
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:54,552
I've been thinking...
You're my brother.

638
01:08:54,760 --> 01:09:00,551
We're brothers,
and when we're together...

639
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,668
I just...

640
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:09,753
You don't drag me down.

641
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:15,073
I drag me down.

642
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:19,159
And you...

643
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:22,918
You complete me.

644
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:26,908
- Shut up.
- What?

645
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:31,671
Just shut up.
You had me at "hello".

646
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:53,837
It seems to me, you're a bit harder
on Doug than you are on Steve.

647
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:59,068
It's true. It's just that Doug is
so rebellious. I can't control him.

648
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,919
But rebellious, scrappy, dreamer...

649
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:06,272
What other young man
does that remind you of?

650
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:12,349
- Myself as a kid.
- So who are you really fighting with?

651
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:21,154
Mr. Grieco...
You see right through me.

652
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:37,076
I missed this car.
I look good in it.

653
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:39,874
And you look good also.

654
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:44,756
Thanks.
Glad you moved back into the room.

655
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:49,033
Dad was cool about the wedding
after his chat with Grieco.

656
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:53,518
And it really improved
your relationship with him.

657
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:00,875
- Is that an outside nightclub?
- That's your idea.

658
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:03,833
Pull over. Let's check it out.

659
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:16,877
- We only let people in on the list.
- We're on the list.

660
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:23,553
- Steve and Doug Butabi.
- Step right in.

661
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:29,437
- Go right in.
- I guess we should go in then.

662
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:35,951
- We're gonna go in.
- We're going in.

663
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:42,271
I can't believe we got in.
Sure it wasn't a mistake?

664
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:45,677
- It's weird to be in here.
- But they stole your idea.

665
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:57,510
Butabis? I've been looking
all over for you. Come here!

666
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:01,838
- Mr. Zadir!
- How do you like our club?

667
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:05,476
- Our club?
- I cut you in. It was your idea.

668
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:10,356
- Sweet ass sweet.
- Running a club is hard work.

669
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,438
- Don't worry about it.
- We're workaholics.

670
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:18,395
Dooey just called from Pismo Beach.
He says he didn't grab your ass.

671
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,716
What is he up to now?

672
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:24,435
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

673
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:28,558
- Let's do some business.
- All right.

674
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:36,998
- Put some cherries on that.
- Nice call.

675
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:42,672
- Mr. Butabi, can you approve this?
- That looks fine and all that.

676
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,997
- Hi, Mr. Barntabi.
- It's Butabi, but that's okay.

677
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:50,830
How's the hair?
Successful-club-owner good?

678
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:55,397
That voice sounds so familiar.

679
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:02,159
- Are you...?
- Doug?

680
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:06,148
- Credit vixen?
- My God, I can't believe this.

681
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:10,239
You're even more beautiful
than you sound.

682
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:16,037
- You stopped calling.
- Not because I didn't want to.

683
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:19,630
Am I what you expected?

684
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:24,150
I totally approve.

685
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:29,717
- You're not here with anyone?
- Just my friend.

686
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:34,359
Hottie police officer?

687
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:39,270
I was really looking forward
to meeting you in court on June 6th.

688
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:43,837
- So, do you guys wanna dance?
- No.

689
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:49,399
- Yes.
- Yes.

690
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:54,037
- Oh, I love this song.
- I'm getting kind of sick of it.

691
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:39,273
I broke the window again.
