1
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:16,284
- 你好。
- 谁，我？他？

2
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:16,285
- Hi.
- Who, me? Him?

3
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:21,582
- Not you.
- Don't worry about it.

4
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:21,624
- 不是你。
- 不要担心。

5
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:34,094
Hey!

6
00:01:29,044 --> 00:01:34,134
嘿！

7
00:01:57,201 --> 00:02:02,289
- How are you doing?
- Oh, fuck off.

8
00:01:57,204 --> 00:02:02,324
- 你怎么样？
- 哦，滚开。

9
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:08,420
- What's up?
- Feel good. All right.

10
00:02:04,494 --> 00:02:08,424
- 这是怎么回事？
- 感觉不错。好的。

11
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:13,717
Excuse me.

12
00:02:08,674 --> 00:02:13,754
对不起。

13
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:21,058
- Yeah. Score.
- Very nice.

14
00:02:15,964 --> 00:02:21,094
- 是啊。分数。
- 很不错的。

15
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:34,614
好的。让我们来谈谈
这个小老太太叫夜。

16
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:34,613
All right. Let's talk
to this little lady called Night.

17
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:48,043
I broke the window again.

18
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:48,044
我再一次打破了窗口。

19
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:52,214
- Dad's gonna be pissed.
- I'll just tell him you did it.

20
00:02:48,294 --> 00:02:52,214
- 爸爸会很生气。
- 我就告诉他，你做到了。

21
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:57,511
But I didn't do it.
I'm driving. Don't do that.

22
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:57,554
但我没有做到这一点。
我开车。不要那样做。

23
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:07,854
所以不管怎么说，我站在那里，
等待使用公用电话...

24
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:07,855
So anyways, I'm standing there,
waiting to use the pay phone...

25
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:13,234
这家伙在电话里轮流
各地和提示他的帽子是这样的。

26
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:13,235
And this guy on the phone turns
around and tips his hat like this.

27
00:03:14,364 --> 00:03:18,284
又是谁，你认为那个家伙是？

28
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:18,240
And who do you think that guy was?

29
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:23,662
- Emilio Estevez.
- 'The Mighty Duck'. I was there!

30
00:03:18,534 --> 00:03:23,654
- 埃米利奥埃斯特韦斯。
- “全能的鸭子”。我在那里！

31
00:03:23,744 --> 00:03:28,834
当然你。你大叫
在“早餐和Clubber的”名称。

32
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:28,834
Of course you were. You yelled
the "Breakfast Clubber's" name.

33
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:38,218
So, anyway.
You guys wanna make out or what?

34
00:03:33,134 --> 00:03:38,254
所以，无论如何。
你们想使出来还是什么？

35
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:15,631
Oh, man. lt was perfect that time.

36
00:04:11,714 --> 00:04:15,634
哦，伙计。 LT是完美的那段时间。

37
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:20,928
Four months of work for nothing.

38
00:04:15,884 --> 00:04:20,964
四个月没有工作。

39
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:26,016
- What's up?
- Did you know you were doing 50?

40
00:04:22,134 --> 00:04:26,054
- 这是怎么回事？
- 你知道你在做什么50？

41
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:31,396
Hottie cop likes you. Think she pulls
over just anybody? Make a move.

42
00:04:26,304 --> 00:04:31,394
棘手的警察喜欢你。想她拉
在普通的人？做出的举动。

43
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:39,613
- What's up?
- Just giving you an $80 ticket.

44
00:04:35,694 --> 00:04:39,614
- 这是怎么回事？
- 只是给你80美元的罚单。

45
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:44,952
She is so into you.

46
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:44,994
她是那么到你。

47
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,209
- I want you to do me a favor.
- Whatever you say, 'T.J. Hooker".

48
00:04:47,164 --> 00:04:52,244
- 我要你帮我一个忙。
- 无论你说什么，'T.J.妓女“。

49
00:04:55,504 --> 00:05:00,584
请遵守所有张贴的速度限制。
有一个美好的夜晚。

50
00:04:55,504 --> 00:05:00,592
Please obey all posted speed limits.
Have a good night.

51
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:05,806
It's already been good, now
that you've served and protected me.

52
00:05:00,714 --> 00:05:05,844
它已经被很好的，现在
你已经送达，保护我。

53
00:05:19,484 --> 00:05:24,614
- 什么是那一点？
- 对不起。

54
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:24,616
- What was the point of that?
- Sorry.

55
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:36,003
Come next week. I'm gonna
take care of you. All right, man.

56
00:05:30,954 --> 00:05:36,044
下周来吧。我要去
照顾你。好吧，伙计。

57
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:39,006
This is the Roxbury. We have a list.

58
00:05:36,164 --> 00:05:39,044
这是罗克斯伯里。我们有一个列表。

59
00:05:39,294 --> 00:05:43,214
- 我们的名单上。道格Butabi。

60
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:43,177
- We're on the list. Doug Butabi.

61
00:05:43,464 --> 00:05:46,344
- 你是兄弟？
- 号

62
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:46,305
- You're brothers?
- No.

63
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:51,727
- Yes. Man!
- That's quite a joke.

64
00:05:46,594 --> 00:05:51,724
- 是的。男人！
- 这是相当一个笑话。

65
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,688
- Doug is hilarious.
- Check this out.

66
00:05:51,814 --> 00:05:54,684
- 道格是热闹。
- 检查了这一点。

67
00:05:54,934 --> 00:06:00,064
你听说过这个吗？
你不就行了。取得一致。

68
00:05:54,938 --> 00:06:00,068
You ever heard of this one?
You're not on the list. Get in line.

69
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:10,494
- LS的..？
- 它是“21跳街”之王。

70
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:10,454
- ls that..?
- It's the king of "21 Jump Street".

71
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:15,626
Richard Grieco.

72
00:06:10,574 --> 00:06:15,664
理查德GRIECO。

73
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:21,757
- Excuse me.
- See you later. We'll go wait in line.

74
00:06:17,874 --> 00:06:21,794
- 对不起。
- 再见。我们会去排队等候。

75
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,885
- Maybe we'll hang out later?
- No chance.

76
00:06:22,044 --> 00:06:24,924
- 也许我们会在后面挂了？
- 没有机会。

77
00:06:25,174 --> 00:06:30,264
- 听起来不错。
- 知道什么是不对的地方吗？

78
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:30,224
- Sounds good.
- Know what's wrong with this place?

79
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:36,480
- They don't evaluate the clientele.
- I thought we just weren't cool enough.

80
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:36,514
- 他们不评价的客户。
- 我以为我们只是没有足够的冷静。

81
00:06:37,684 --> 00:06:42,774
你是一个美丽的人。知道什么
当我们得到我们的俱乐部我们该怎么办？

82
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:42,778
You are a beautiful man. Know what
we're gonna do when we get our club?

83
00:06:43,944 --> 00:06:49,034
我们要对待所有的崇拜者只是
以及任何传奇的电视明星。

84
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:49,034
We're gonna treat all wannabes just
as well as any legendary tv-star.

85
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:55,249
- That's pretty Roosevelt of you.
- It's just what I believe in.

86
00:06:50,204 --> 00:06:55,284
- 这就是你漂亮罗斯福。
- 这正是我相信英寸

87
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:01,380
- Wanna dance?
- We're not in the club yet.

88
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:01,424
- 想跳舞？
- 我们不是在俱乐部呢。

89
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:05,551
So, maybe when we get in?

90
00:07:01,674 --> 00:07:05,594
所以，也许，当我们进去呢？

91
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:10,973
So I'm waiting to use the pay phone,
and this guy tips his hat like this.

92
00:07:05,844 --> 00:07:10,974
所以我等待使用公用电话，
这家伙提示他的帽子是这样的。

93
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:19,314
- 又是谁，你认为那个家伙是？
- 埃米利奥埃斯特韦斯！

94
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:19,314
- And who do you think that guy was?
- Emilio Estevez!

95
00:07:19,394 --> 00:07:24,484
“全能的鸭子”，男人。我发誓
神。我当时一样，“埃米利奥！”

96
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:24,486
'The Mighty Duck', man. I swear
to God. I was, like, "Emilio!"

97
00:07:26,694 --> 00:07:31,824
“埃米利奥..！”

98
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:31,827
"Emilio..!"

99
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:36,957
The club is closed, folks. Sorry.

100
00:07:31,914 --> 00:07:36,994
该俱乐部是封闭的，伙计。抱歉。

101
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:09,364
- Nozzled你，我的朋友。
- 完全让我。

102
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:09,364
- Nozzled you, my friend.
- Totally got me.

103
00:08:09,444 --> 00:08:14,534
那是在我的鼻子。

104
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:14,536
That was in my nose.

105
00:08:16,744 --> 00:08:21,874
- 你是个白痴。
- 哦，是吗？你喜欢它。

106
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:21,835
- You're an idiot.
- Oh yeah? You like it.

107
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:28,091
Get off... Watch it!

108
00:08:23,004 --> 00:08:28,134
下车......当心！

109
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:36,475
Where's Mom? And who's this
gorgeous young hottie in the kitchen?

110
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:36,474
哪里的妈妈？而谁是这个
华丽的年轻辣妹在厨房里？

111
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:41,647
- Why is she wearing Mom's bathrobe?
- What do you think of my new chin?

112
00:08:36,554 --> 00:08:41,644
- 为什么她穿着妈妈的浴袍？
- 你觉得我的新下巴？

113
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:45,692
ls it better than last year's?

114
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:45,694
LS比去年的更好？

115
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:51,073
Behave yourselves. Look who's
gracing us with their presence.

116
00:08:45,944 --> 00:08:51,074
表现自己。看看谁
杀入我们与他们的存在。

117
00:08:52,194 --> 00:08:54,074
- 谁？
- 在这里，爸爸。

118
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,076
- Who?
- Here, Dad.

119
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:59,414
这是一个健康的震动。
LT帮我打我的身体峰值。

120
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:59,414
It's a health shake.
lt helps me hit my physical peak.

121
00:08:59,494 --> 00:09:03,414
拿相机。
他会打他的巅峰。

122
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:03,377
Get the camera.
He's gonna hit his peak.

123
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:08,715
- Honey, do it in your room.
- Oh, Mom, you're so funny.

124
00:09:03,664 --> 00:09:08,754
- 亲爱的，做在你的房间。
- 哦，妈妈，你太逗了。

125
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:13,971
Steve? In the store in a haIf hour.
Wear something nice. Emily's back.

126
00:09:08,884 --> 00:09:14,014
史蒂夫？在店里的haIf小时。
穿一件好事。艾米莉的背部。

127
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:19,017
As if he gives a flying rat's ass.

128
00:09:15,134 --> 00:09:19,054
仿佛他给出了一个飞鼠的屁股。

129
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:22,187
"Flying rat's ass..."
That would be wild to see.

130
00:09:19,304 --> 00:09:22,184
“飞天老鼠的屁股......”
这将是野看到的。

131
00:09:22,434 --> 00:09:27,524
史蒂夫，在商店中haIf小时。
带上你跳舞的猴子兄弟。

132
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:27,526
Steve, at the store in a haIf hour.
Bring your dancing monkey brother.

133
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:32,174
喂，你是从外地来的？
你有一个本地号码？

134
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:32,132
Hey, are you from out of town?
You have a local number?

135
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:42,559
Are you all right? Sure?

136
00:10:37,514 --> 00:10:42,594
你没事吧？确定吗？

137
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:57,199
Finally. An hour and a haIf late.
Steve, go dust the roses.

138
00:10:52,114 --> 00:10:57,194
终于。一个小时haIf晚。

145
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:23,183

149
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:32,524
很好的一个。好吧。

150
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:32,526
Good one. Okay.

151
00:11:32,774 --> 00:11:37,904
确定这是你的卡？这不是
处理。我要调用它。

152
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:37,906
Sure this is your card? It's not
processing. I have to call it in.

153
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:53,380
- Operator 238, please.
- Authorisation. Card number?

154
00:11:49,454 --> 00:11:53,384
- 操作员238，请。
- 授权。卡号？

155
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:57,509
- What's up?
- I told you not to call anymore.

156
00:11:53,634 --> 00:11:57,554
- 这是怎么回事？
- 我告诉过你不要来找我了。

157
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:01,680
- I need an approval.
- Card number?

158
00:11:57,804 --> 00:12:01,724
- 我需要一个审批。
- 卡号？

159
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:07,060
- Not the card, sweetness, me.
- Shut up and swipe it.

160
00:12:01,974 --> 00:12:07,094
- 不卡，甜度，我。
- 闭嘴，刷卡吧。

161
00:12:08,224 --> 00:12:12,144
我可以去试试。

162
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:12,149
I can go for that.

163
00:12:12,394 --> 00:12:17,524
你喜欢吗？这是否感觉很好吗？
因为我可以整夜刷卡吧。

164
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,529
You like that? Does that feel good?
'Cause I can swipe it all night.

165
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:23,784
- 该卡的罚款。再见，道格。
- 再见，238。

166
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:23,785
- The card's fine. Bye, Doug.
- Bye, 238.

167
00:12:26,994 --> 00:12:29,874
你好。我可以帮你吗？

168
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:29,875
Hi. Can I help you?

169
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:35,214
嗨，道格。您的夜总会太酷了。
我的模型的朋友可以进来吗？

170
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:35,214
Hi, Doug. Your nightclub's so cool.
Can my model friends come in?

171
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:39,259
- No. Yes.
- You're so funny and cute and tall.

172
00:12:35,334 --> 00:12:39,254
- 否是。
- 你是那么有趣和可爱和高大。

173
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:41,345
Let's shake it.

174
00:12:39,504 --> 00:12:41,384
让我们动摇它。

175
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:46,683
What are you doing? You have to cut up
my plants and make toys of them?

176
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:46,724
你在做什么？你不得不削减了
我的工厂，使他们的玩具？

177
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:51,730
- It's a club with a jungle theme.
- You're a jungle theme.

178
00:12:47,854 --> 00:12:51,774
- 这是一个丛林主题的俱乐部。
- 你是个丛林主题。

179
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:57,152
Go find your brother and load
the trucks. ldiot... Useless!

180
00:12:52,024 --> 00:12:57,144
去找你的兄弟和负载
卡车。 ldiot ......没用！

181
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:11,583
- Steve..?
- Don't look.

182
00:13:07,664 --> 00:13:11,584
- 史蒂夫..？
- 不要看。

183
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:16,914
- 嗨，史蒂夫。嘿，道格。
- 不管。

184
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:16,922
- Hi, Steve. Hey, Doug.
- Whatever.

185
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:30,310
Now I'm back,
so we can get together.

186
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:30,354
现在，我回来了，
所以我们可以走到一起。

187
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:34,481
- You wanna go see a movie?
- Sure.

188
00:13:30,604 --> 00:13:34,524
- 你想去看电影吗？
- 当然。

189
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:39,862
Or we could just drive around
and make out. I love making out.

190
00:13:34,774 --> 00:13:39,854
或者我们可以只是带动周边
而做出来的。我爱拍出来。

191
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:47,202
- And I'm really good at it.
- Sounds good.

192
00:13:42,074 --> 00:13:47,194
- 我真的很擅长。
- 听起来不错。

193
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:52,374
背过，Chicklett。我和哥哥
我，我们住的生活的快车道。

194
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:52,374
Back off, Chicklett. My brother and
I, we live life in the fast lane.

195
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:57,462
That means no stop signs,
no pulling over to take pictures.

196
00:13:53,544 --> 00:13:57,464
这意味着没有停止的迹象，
没有拉过来拍照。

197
00:13:57,713 --> 00:14:02,801
See this man? He's my co-pilot
on this magic carpet ride.

198
00:13:57,714 --> 00:14:02,794
看到这个人吗？他是我的副驾驶
在此乘坐魔毯。

199
00:14:02,924 --> 00:14:08,054
- 你只是太多的行李。
- 闭嘴，道格。

200
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:07,973
- You're just way too much luggage.
- Shut up, Doug.

201
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:14,271
Emily?
I see you've picked the right son.

202
00:14:09,184 --> 00:14:14,314
艾米丽？
我看你已经选对了儿子。

203
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:19,318
You know, Steve likes you very much.

204
00:14:15,434 --> 00:14:19,354
你知道，史蒂夫很喜欢你。

205
00:14:19,604 --> 00:14:24,734
Butabi先生。 LS史蒂夫询问艾米丽
再嫁给他吗？

206
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:24,740
Mr. Butabi. ls Steve asking Emily
to marry him again?

207
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:29,784
你知道吗？
如果他们有足够的孩子， -

208
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:29,786
You know something?
If they have enough children, -

209
00:14:30,034 --> 00:14:32,914
- 我们不会有雇用推销员。

210
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:32,915
we won't have to hire salesmen.

211
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:38,254
- 哦，Kamehl，你杀了我。
- 不，你杀了我，桑德森先生。

212
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:38,253
- Oh, Kamehl, you kill me.
- No, you kill me, Mr. Sanderson.

213
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:44,510
- Can you please leave Steve alone?
- He likes the girl... Yes, you do!

214
00:14:39,424 --> 00:14:44,504
- 可以请你离开史蒂夫一个人吗？
- 他喜欢的女孩......是的，你这样做！

215
00:14:46,724 --> 00:14:51,844
你看这墙呢？之后，他们
结婚后，我们将结合门店 -

216
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:51,808
You see this wall? After they
get married, we'll combine stores -

217
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:55,854
- and have the first plant-lamp
shop. Steve and Emily will run it.

218
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:55,854
- 并具有第一家工厂灯
店。史蒂夫和艾米丽将运行它。

219
00:14:56,063 --> 00:15:01,151
- Maybe you can clean the toilets.
- You're living on "Fantasy lsland".

220
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:08,325
- God, that was a sweet show.
- I have a fantasy.

221
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:13,705
That I have two capable sons.
Not one with his head up his ass!

222
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:18,961
ls this how you load trucks?
Disgusting. Get out of here.

223
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:18,954
LS这个你怎么加载卡车？
恶心。离开这里。

224
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:27,134
- 所以，我们是在休息？
- 我猜。

225
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:27,135
- So we're on a break?
- I guess.

226
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:32,474
- 你想紧缩呢？
- 当然。让我们来紧缩。

227
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:32,516
- You wanna crunch it?
- Sure. Let's crunch.

228
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:41,859
- Can the rest of us use the mirror?
- Appreciate it.

229
00:15:36,774 --> 00:15:41,894
- 我们其他人可以使用镜子？
- 欣赏它。

230
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:45,863
- Everyone's got an attitude here.
- Gentlemen! Looking large.

231
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:45,904
- 每个人的在这里得到了一个态度。
- 先生们！寻找大。

232
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:51,201
Want my power bar?
How about an energy bar?

233
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:51,244
希望我的力量吧？
怎么样的能量棒？

234
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:56,456
- I got a muscle triplicator bar.
- Supplements aside...

235
00:15:51,364 --> 00:15:56,494
- 我有一个肌肉triplicator吧。
- 补充抛开...

236
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:01,503
- How long have we been friends?
- All seven years of high school.

237
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:01,544
- 多长时间了，我们一直是朋友？
- 所有七岁月高中。

238
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:06,924
这就是为什么我不会粉饰
它。我很担心你的三头肌。

239
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:06,925
That's why I'm not gonna sugar coat
it. I'm worried about your triceps.

240
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:14,184
你不会一路下跌。
我没有看到完全伸直。

241
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:14,224
You aren't going all the way down.
I'm not seeing full extension.

242
00:16:14,304 --> 00:16:19,434
我们有关于长谈
那天晚上。

243
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:19,438
We had a long talk about that
the other night.

244
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:24,568
You just shouldn't cheat yourselves.
Sorry to come down on you like this.

245
00:16:19,524 --> 00:16:24,604
你刚才不应该欺骗自己。
对不起下来就你这个样子。

246
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:30,699
That's why we love you and hate you.

247
00:16:26,824 --> 00:16:30,744
这就是为什么我们爱你，恨你。

248
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:33,827
- Still friends?
- You know it.

249
00:16:30,994 --> 00:16:33,864
- 还是朋友吗？
- 你知道它。

250
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:39,166
I'm glad we had this talk.

251
00:16:34,114 --> 00:16:39,204
我很高兴我们有这样的谈话。

252
00:16:53,934 --> 00:16:56,804
我的店里一个伟大的想法...

253
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:56,808
I had a great idea for the store...

254
00:16:57,054 --> 00:17:02,144
这家店？你应该是
想着......嘿，这是怎么回事？

255
00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:02,147
The store? You're supposed to be
thinking about... Hey, what's up?

256
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:08,403
- Can we call you sometime?
- Want some of this?

257
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:08,404
- 我们可以打电话给你？
- 想要一些这方面？

258
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:12,449
- Think about our future.
- You're Mount St. Helensing on me.

259
00:17:08,524 --> 00:17:12,444
- 想想我们的未来。
- 你是摩圣Helensing我。

260
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:15,536
Why are you forgetting our plans?

261
00:17:12,694 --> 00:17:15,574
为什么你忘记了我们的计划？

262
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:20,874
The plans about you and I opening up
only the coolest club a la the Roxbury.

263
00:17:15,824 --> 00:17:20,914
你和我开拓计划
只有最酷的俱乐部一拉罗克斯伯里。

264
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:26,129
- How? We can't even get in.
- We're letting them not let us in.

265
00:17:21,044 --> 00:17:26,164
- 怎么了？我们甚至不能进入。
- 我们让他们不会让我们进去。

266
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:32,427
But no more. It's time we step up
into that sweet-ass world.

267
00:17:27,294 --> 00:17:32,424
但没有更多。这时候，我们加强
成甜美的屁股世界。

268
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:38,684
从现在开始，唯一的俱乐部
我们要的是罗克斯伯里。

269
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:38,725
From now on, the only club
we're going to is the Roxbury.

270
00:17:38,764 --> 00:17:41,644
- 我们不能...
- 我们能。你知道为什么吗？

271
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:41,687
- We can't...
- We can. You know why?

272
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:47,024
- 我们好找？
- 非常好看。你特别。

273
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:47,025
- We're good looking?
- Very good looking. You especially.

274
00:17:47,104 --> 00:17:52,194
跟着我念：
我们可以进入罗克斯伯里。

275
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:52,197
Repeat after me:
We can get into the Roxbury.

276
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:56,243
We can get into the Roxbury.

277
00:17:52,324 --> 00:17:56,244
我们可以进入罗克斯伯里。

278
00:17:56,451 --> 00:18:01,582
Roxbury..!

279
00:17:56,494 --> 00:18:01,624
罗克斯伯里..！

280
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:10,924
Hey, what's up? You want some
of this? How about a little of that?

281
00:18:05,874 --> 00:18:10,964
嘿，这是怎么回事？你想要一些
这个？如何一点点呢？

282
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:17,181
She starts to smell them.
She thought they were real plants!

283
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:17,214
她开始闻到它们。
她以为他们是真正的植物！

284
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:24,394
- 喂？
- 这是怎么回事？

285
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:24,438
- Hello?
- What's up?

286
00:18:24,644 --> 00:18:29,734
该Sandersons在这里看到
你母亲的新下巴。穿好衣服。

287
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:29,735
The Sandersons are here to see
your mother's new chin. Get dressed.

288
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:34,990
- Sorry, we're a bit busy tonight.
- Steve? I'll be right back.

289
00:18:29,864 --> 00:18:34,984
- 对不起，我们有点忙，今晚。
- 史蒂夫？我马上就回来。

290
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:41,205
I like your bathing suit. You have
really good muscle definition.

291
00:18:36,114 --> 00:18:41,244
我喜欢你的泳衣。你有
真的好肌肉的定义。

292
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:46,376
Most Americans don't wear revealing
bathing suits. Very European of you.

293
00:18:41,324 --> 00:18:46,414
大多数美国人不穿暴露
泳衣。很欧洲的你。

294
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:51,632
It's really sexy and I have
a really good taste in what's sexy.

295
00:18:46,544 --> 00:18:51,674
这真的很性感，我有
一个真正的好味道什么是性感。

296
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:57,888
- Steve!
- Whatever, Emily.

297
00:18:52,794 --> 00:18:57,924
- 史蒂夫！
- 无论如何，艾米丽。

298
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:14,488
Good.

299
00:19:12,614 --> 00:19:14,484
好。

300
00:19:14,694 --> 00:19:18,614
这是怎么回事..？

301
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:18,617
What's going on..?

302
00:19:18,864 --> 00:19:23,954
你是从外地来的..？

303
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:23,956
Are you from out of town..?

304
00:19:56,404 --> 00:20:01,494
当我告诉你做一些事情，
我的意思是。从来没有进来半裸。

305
00:19:56,405 --> 00:20:01,493
When I tell you to do something,
I mean it. Never come in half-naked.

306
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:08,792
- Put some clothes on and come down.
- lsn't on our things-to-do-list.

307
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:08,834
- 把一些衣服和回落。
- lsn't我们的东西，待办事项清单上。

308
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:13,964
- We have something to do tonight.
- Yes. To get downstairs.

309
00:20:08,914 --> 00:20:14,004
- 我们今晚的东西做。
- 是的。要下楼。

310
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:18,010
I don't want to!

311
00:20:14,134 --> 00:20:18,054
我不想！

312
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:22,222
How do I get through
to this individual?

313
00:20:18,304 --> 00:20:22,224
我如何打通
这个人吗？

314
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:25,350
Doug is like a fax machine.

315
00:20:22,474 --> 00:20:25,354
道格就像是一台传真机。

316
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:30,689
Without a cover page, people don't
know where it's coming from.

317
00:20:25,604 --> 00:20:30,684
没有封面，让人不
知道它的来源。

318
00:20:31,854 --> 00:20:36,944
有时你听到忙音。
这就是为什么你有一个重拨键。

319
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:36,945
And sometimes you get a busy signal.
That's why you got a redial button.

320
00:20:37,074 --> 00:20:42,194
- 其实，我总是把事情搞砸...
- 请勿打扰。他永远也不会明白。

321
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:42,201
- Actually, I always screw it up...
- Don't bother. He'll never understand.

322
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:47,372
I understand very well. You're going
to a new, hot club tonight, right?

323
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:47,374
我非常理解。你要去
到一个新的，热的俱乐部今晚，对不对？

324
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:55,714
- But how are you gonna get there?
- What are you doing?

325
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:55,714
- 但是，你要怎么到达那里？
- 你在做什么？

326
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:26,829
You can take away our phones
and our keys, but not our dreams.

327
00:21:22,944 --> 00:21:26,874
你可以拿走我们的手机
和我们的钥匙，但不是我们的梦想。

328
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,251
'Cos we're, like, sleeping
when we have them.

329
00:21:27,124 --> 00:21:32,244
因为此刻我们一样，睡觉
当我们有他们。

330
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:37,422
Later much!

331
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:37,424
以后多！

332
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:42,636
Boys, wait. I don't like you leaving
without a phone.

333
00:21:37,544 --> 00:21:42,674
男孩，等待。我不喜欢你离开
没有一个电话。

334
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:46,682
How old are these? How embarrassing.

335
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:46,684
你几岁了这些？多么尴尬。

336
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:51,979
You know, in case of emergency.
Have fun.

337
00:21:46,934 --> 00:21:52,014
要知道，在紧急情况下。
有乐趣。

338
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:57,274
- 难道让妈妈的口红在我身上？
- LT看起来像你亲热。

339
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:57,276
- Did Mom get lipstick on me?
- lt looks like you were making out.

340
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:13,917
- How's my hair? Roxbury-good?
- You know it.

341
00:22:08,824 --> 00:22:13,954
- 如何是我的头发吗？ Roxbury的，好不好？
- 你知道它。

342
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:19,131
I've got to tell you, Steve,
tonight, I can taste it.

343
00:22:14,044 --> 00:22:19,124
我得告诉你，史蒂夫，
今晚，我可以品尝它。

344
00:22:20,294 --> 00:22:25,384
我不能品尝它。我很害怕现在。
我不知道该怎么办。

345
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:25,387
I can't taste it. I'm so scared right now.
I don't know what to do.

346
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:30,642
- You're mad-cowing on me. Relax.
- I'm nervous.

347
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:35,814
- 正是这种压力进入。
- 你必须把自己的控制权。

348
00:22:30,726 --> 00:22:35,814
- It's this pressure to get in.
- You must take control of yourself.

349
00:22:36,982 --> 00:22:42,070
No, you take control.
I'm barely hanging on here.

350
00:22:36,984 --> 00:22:42,064
不，你掌握控制权。
我勉强挂在这里。

351
00:22:43,234 --> 00:22:48,324
来吧，放松身心。觉得小狗
和糖果手杖，好吗？

352
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:48,285
Come on, relax. Think puppies
and candy canes, all right?

353
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:53,540
- Hey, hotlegs. What's going on?
- We'll clean it up later. Don't worry.

354
00:22:48,454 --> 00:22:53,574
- 嘿，hotlegs。这是怎么回事？
- 我们将在后面清理。不要担心。

355
00:22:56,752 --> 00:23:01,882
I see your Roxbury balloon
and I hate to burst it, -

356
00:22:56,794 --> 00:23:01,924
我看到你的气球罗克斯伯里
我恨用来破灭的吧， -

357
00:23:03,044 --> 00:23:08,174
- 但我不认为
我们的名字都在此列。

358
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:08,180
- but I don't think
our names are on that list.

359
00:23:08,222 --> 00:23:10,182
Perfect. "Rites of Passage".

360
00:23:08,264 --> 00:23:10,144
完美的。 “礼记通道”。

361
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:15,437
Remember? A boy in the jungle
with only a spear to hunt the lion.

362
00:23:10,344 --> 00:23:15,434
还记得吗？在丛林的男孩
只用矛捕猎狮子。

363
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:20,524
这款车是我们的矛。
这Roxbury的是我们的狮子。

364
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:20,526
This van is our spear.
That Roxbury is our lion.

365
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:24,694
- 是否保镖知道吗？
- 他是要找出答案。

366
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:24,696
- Does the bouncer know about this?
- He's about to find out.

367
00:23:24,944 --> 00:23:26,824
下周见。

368
00:23:24,947 --> 00:23:26,824
See you next week.

369
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:32,079
- My good hombre. Remember us?
- Doug and Steve Butabi.

370
00:23:27,034 --> 00:23:32,114
- 我的好HOMBRE。还记得我们吗？
- 道格和史蒂夫Butabi。

371
00:23:33,247 --> 00:23:37,167
- You're brothers?
- No... Yes.

372
00:23:33,284 --> 00:23:37,204
- 你是兄弟？
- 不......是的。

373
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:40,295
- Man!
- Works every time.

374
00:23:37,454 --> 00:23:40,334
- 人！
- 屡试不爽。

375
00:23:40,546 --> 00:23:45,676
Now I remember. You can't come in.

376
00:23:40,584 --> 00:23:45,714
现在我还记得。你不能进来。

377
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:50,848
What's up, partner?
How are you doing tonight?

378
00:23:45,804 --> 00:23:50,884
这是怎么回事，合作伙伴？
如何你今天晚上干什么？

379
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:54,934
时间玩一个小垒球。

380
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:54,935
Time to play a little softball.

381
00:23:55,184 --> 00:24:00,314
- 嘿，好男人。怎么样了？
- 良好。你stilI不能进来。

382
00:23:55,185 --> 00:24:00,315
- Hey, good man. How's it going?
- Good. You stilI can't come in.

383
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:06,572
That's not what my friend told me.
His name is Abraham.

384
00:24:01,444 --> 00:24:06,564
这不是我的朋友告诉我的。
他的名字叫亚伯拉罕。

385
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:13,704
- You don't know him?
- What about his two friends?

386
00:24:09,784 --> 00:24:13,704
- 你不认识他吗？
- 那么他的两个朋友？

387
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:19,042
George Washington
and George Washington?

388
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:19,084
乔治·华盛顿
和乔治·华盛顿？

389
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:26,300
And George Washington is a little
lonely. Wants to join his buddies.

390
00:24:21,254 --> 00:24:26,334
和乔治·华盛顿是一个小
孤独。想要加入他的哥们。

391
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:33,640
And look who else we've got.
Roosevelt, Roosevelt and Jefferson.

392
00:24:28,554 --> 00:24:33,674
再看看还有谁，我们已经有了。
罗斯福，罗斯福和杰弗逊。

393
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:43,024
谢谢...大。

394
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:43,025
Thanks... Great.

395
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:48,280
- ls that an ATM?
- That's where we drop off videos.

396
00:24:43,154 --> 00:24:48,274
- LS，一个自动取款机？
- 这就是我们下车的视频。

397
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:51,241
- Hello, that's it.
- That was a card store.

398
00:24:48,364 --> 00:24:51,244
- 你好，仅此而已。
- 这是一个卡存储。

399
00:24:51,492 --> 00:24:56,622
- That's just Weight Watchers...
- ATM. That's it.

400
00:24:51,494 --> 00:24:56,614
- 这只是慧俪轻体...
- 自动取款机。就是这样。

401
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:07,883
- Shit. The car.
- What about me?

402
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:07,924
- 妈的。这款车。
- 那我呢？

403
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:13,263
This racing car is illegal.
All I need is a police report.

404
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:13,304
该赛车是非法的。
所有我需要的是一个警察报告。

405
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:18,352
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, let me see.

406
00:25:14,434 --> 00:25:18,354
- 你没事吧？
- 是啊，让我看看。

407
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:23,774
Great. They're starting
with the neck injuries. I'm screwed.

408
00:25:18,604 --> 00:25:23,724
大。他们开始
与颈部受伤。我搞砸了。

409
00:25:25,901 --> 00:25:28,779
Jesus, man.

410
00:25:25,904 --> 00:25:28,774
耶稣的人。

411
00:25:29,024 --> 00:25:34,154
- 对不起你的面包车。
- 没办法。理查德GRIECO！

412
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:34,159
- Sorry about your van.
- No way. Richard Grieco!

413
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:40,414
- 我们看到你在罗克斯伯里。
- 右。那你想干什么？

414
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:40,415
- We saw you at the Roxbury.
- Right. So what do you want to do?

415
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:46,630
- Go to the Roxbury again.
- We couldn't get in.

416
00:25:41,544 --> 00:25:46,664
- 转到罗克斯伯里一次。
- 我们进不去。

417
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:51,802
You want me to get you
into the Roxbury? Great. Follow me.

418
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:51,844
你要我给你
进入罗克斯伯里？大。跟我来。

419
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:57,975
- Amazing.
- lt all comes from within.

420
00:25:55,094 --> 00:25:57,974
- 惊人的。
- LT全部来自内心。

421
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:02,144
他觉得这是因为他是一个演员。

422
00:25:58,225 --> 00:26:02,145
He felt it because he's an actor.

423
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:07,524
我们得让停在罗克斯伯里。
我只是不想打官司。

424
00:26:02,396 --> 00:26:07,526
We gotta make a stop at the Roxbury.
I just don't want a lawsuit.

425
00:26:22,204 --> 00:26:27,294
哦，我的上帝，这是最
令人惊叹的地方我去过。

426
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:27,254
Oh, my God, this is the most
amazing place I've ever been.

427
00:26:28,422 --> 00:26:33,510
This is the coatroom.
The club's in there.

428
00:26:28,464 --> 00:26:33,544
这是衣帽间。
该俱乐部是在那里。

429
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:39,766
What's up..?

430
00:26:34,714 --> 00:26:39,804
这是怎么回事..？

431
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:46,064
- 获取控制住自己。
- 这是在这里棘手超载。

432
00:26:40,976 --> 00:26:46,064
- Get a hold of yourself.
- It's hottie overload in here.

433
00:26:46,184 --> 00:26:51,314
- 只是自己的步伐。
- 这是怎么回事？二，三，四。

434
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:51,320
- Just pace yourself.
- What's up? Two, three, four.

435
00:26:51,403 --> 00:26:56,492
What's up? Two, three, four...

436
00:26:51,404 --> 00:26:56,484
这是怎么回事？二，三，四......

437
00:26:58,702 --> 00:27:01,580
- Sweet!
- Sweet!

438
00:26:58,704 --> 00:27:01,584
- 甜！
- 甜！

439
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,666
Richie, good to see you. Get over here.

440
00:27:01,834 --> 00:27:04,704
里奇，很高兴见到你。在这里渡过。

441
00:27:04,954 --> 00:27:10,084
- 这个地方被踢。
- 跳跃像“21跳街”。

442
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:10,047
- The place is kicking.
- Jumping like "21 Jump Street".

443
00:27:11,173 --> 00:27:16,303
Who are your friends?

444
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:16,344
谁是你的朋友？

445
00:27:24,728 --> 00:27:27,648
- The owner.
- The man we want to be.

446
00:27:24,764 --> 00:27:27,644
- 雇主。
- 我们想成为的人。

447
00:27:27,894 --> 00:27:33,024
- 我以为我们想成为GRIECO。
- 专业，这是这个家伙。

448
00:27:27,898 --> 00:27:33,028
- I thought we wanted to be Grieco.
- Professionally, it's this guy.

449
00:27:36,234 --> 00:27:41,364
Dooey，我的主要人。我喜欢
这名男子。满足Butabi兄弟。

450
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,370
Dooey, my main man. I love
this man. Meet the Butabi brothers.

451
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:47,584
These are good boys.
Did you grab my ass?

452
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:47,624
这些都是很好的男生。
你抢了我的屁股？

453
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:51,588
- No, sir. I did not grab your ass.
- It's okay if you did.

454
00:27:48,754 --> 00:27:51,634
- 不，先生。我没有抢你的屁股。
- 没关系，如果你没有。

455
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:56,927
I understand. It's just that
you're barking up the wrong tree.

456
00:27:51,884 --> 00:27:56,964
我明白了。这只是
你找错了树。

457
00:28:00,222 --> 00:28:03,100
- You guys come here a lot?
- All the time.

458
00:28:00,224 --> 00:28:03,104
- 你们到这里来了很多？
- 所有的时间。

459
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:07,271
- But we've never been inside.
- Watch what you're saying.

460
00:28:03,354 --> 00:28:07,274
- 但是，我们从来没有进去过。
- 注意你在说什么。

461
00:28:07,521 --> 00:28:12,651
So, is Johnny Depp meeting you here?

462
00:28:07,524 --> 00:28:12,644
那么，是约翰尼·德普在这儿见到你？

463
00:28:13,774 --> 00:28:17,694
号

464
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:17,698
No.

465
00:28:17,944 --> 00:28:23,074
好吧......听着，本尼，
回头见。见你，伙计们。

466
00:28:17,948 --> 00:28:23,078
All right... Listen, Bennie,
see you later. See you, guys.

467
00:28:24,163 --> 00:28:29,293
- See you, Richard Grieco.
- See you, Grieco's lady.

468
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:29,334
- 见你，理查德GRIECO。
- 再见，GRIECO的淑女。

469
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:35,549
I'm honoured to shoot the shit with
the owner of the club of all clubs.

470
00:28:30,464 --> 00:28:35,584
我很荣幸拍摄的狗屎
所有俱乐部的会所的所有者。

471
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:41,805
- And we're proficient club hoppers.
- We usually go to the Mudd Club.

472
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:41,844
- 我们是精通俱乐部料斗。
- 我们通常去的穆德俱乐部。

473
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:46,894
- That place is rank.
- They let any asswad in the door.

474
00:28:42,974 --> 00:28:46,894
- 那个地方是军衔。
- 他们让在门的任何asswad。

475
00:28:47,144 --> 00:28:51,064
- 我自己的那个地方也。
- 这是一个非常好的位置，但。

476
00:28:47,144 --> 00:28:51,064
- I own that place also.
- It's a really good location, though.

477
00:28:51,314 --> 00:28:56,444
不，你说得对。一天
你热，第二天你不是。

478
00:28:51,315 --> 00:28:56,445
No, you're right. One day
you're hot, the next day you're not.

479
00:29:00,694 --> 00:29:04,624
其实，我有一个想法的俱乐部。

480
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:04,620
Actually, I had an idea for a club.

481
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:08,790
- Wait. Did you grab my ass?
- No.

482
00:29:04,874 --> 00:29:08,794
- 等待。你抢了我的屁股？
- 号

483
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:14,129
- Do you want to?
- No. Should I?

484
00:29:09,044 --> 00:29:14,124
- 你想？
- 号要这样呢？

485
00:29:16,298 --> 00:29:20,177
Okay. Continue.

486
00:29:16,334 --> 00:29:20,264
好吧。继续。

487
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:25,599
People waiting outside are bummed,
'cos they're trying to get in.

488
00:29:20,514 --> 00:29:25,634
人在外面等着被摄影课，
'因为他们正试图进入。

489
00:29:26,725 --> 00:29:30,687
What if the outside of the club
looked like the inside?

490
00:29:26,764 --> 00:29:30,684
如果有什么俱乐部的外
看上去像里面？

491
00:29:30,934 --> 00:29:36,064
带沙发和音乐和所有。
但随后在里面......

492
00:29:30,938 --> 00:29:36,068
With couches and music and all that.
But then on the inside...

493
00:29:37,194 --> 00:29:41,114
......它看起来像街头。
要知道，汽车和体征。

494
00:29:37,194 --> 00:29:41,114
... it looks like the street.
You know, cars and signs.

495
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:46,494
外侧是内侧
和内侧的外侧。

496
00:29:41,365 --> 00:29:46,495
The outside is the inside
and the inside is the outside.

497
00:29:46,574 --> 00:29:49,454
不吹你的心？

498
00:29:46,578 --> 00:29:49,456
Doesn't that blow your mind?

499
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:54,834
- 怎么样的人？
- 拥有一间餐厅。之一。

500
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:54,837
- What about that guy?
- Owns a restaurant. One.

501
00:29:54,878 --> 00:29:59,967
- Boy, has this place gone downhill.
- No one over six figures. Let's go.

502
00:29:54,924 --> 00:30:00,004
- 男孩，已经这个地方走了下坡路。
- 没有人超过六位数。让我们去。

503
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:05,055
- Wait. That's that Zadir guy.
- Who are those guys with him?

504
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:05,094
- 等待。就是这样Zadir家伙。
- 谁是那些家伙和他在一起？

505
00:30:05,264 --> 00:30:10,394
If they're with Zadir,
they've got to be worth something.

506
00:30:05,344 --> 00:30:10,434
如果他们与Zadir，
他们必须是值得的东西。

507
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:13,397
Great. Let's work.

508
00:30:10,564 --> 00:30:13,434
大。让我们携手。

509
00:30:13,684 --> 00:30:17,604
- 告诉他关于吸血鬼的想法。
- 这是一个愚蠢的想法。

510
00:30:13,689 --> 00:30:17,568
- Tell him about the vampire idea.
- That's a dumb idea.

511
00:30:17,854 --> 00:30:20,734
我必须打个招呼金凯瑞。

512
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,737
I have to say hello to Jim Carrey.

513
00:30:20,984 --> 00:30:23,864
来到这里，
你的宠物侦探混蛋。

514
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:23,866
Come here,
you pet detective bastard.

515
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:29,204
“吸烟”，你疯了狗娘养的。

516
00:30:24,116 --> 00:30:29,204
"Smoking", you crazy son of a bitch.

517
00:30:29,324 --> 00:30:34,454
- 是我太爱出风头？难道我说话呢？
- 你是完全阐明。

518
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:34,459
- Was I too pushy? Did I speak well?
- You were totally articulate.

519
00:30:34,543 --> 00:30:39,631
It's hard to pitch in a nightclub.
The music is way too loud in here.

520
00:30:34,544 --> 00:30:39,624
很难在一家夜总会在球场。
音乐是太大声在这里。

521
00:30:39,715 --> 00:30:44,845
We have to get a meeting. Steve..?

522
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:44,884
我们必须得到一个会议。史蒂夫..？

523
00:30:57,482 --> 00:31:00,319
- You want to dance?
- Yes.

524
00:30:57,484 --> 00:31:00,364
- 你想跳舞吗？
- 是的。

525
00:31:00,611 --> 00:31:04,531
- All right. Take it easy.
- She said yes.

526
00:31:00,614 --> 00:31:04,534
- 好吧。别紧张。
- 她说是的。

527
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:09,912
Hotties wanna shake it. Come on.

528
00:31:04,784 --> 00:31:09,904
帅哥美女想动摇它。来吧。

529
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:22,294
这是一些很好的屁股，霎那
对那里发生的。

530
00:33:17,206 --> 00:33:22,294
That's some good ass-grabbing
going on there.

531
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:31,554
1 980。不错的一年。

532
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:31,553
1980. Good year.

533
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:35,766
Excellent year. Devo had a huge hit.

534
00:33:31,804 --> 00:33:35,724
出色的一年。泥盆有一个巨大的打击。

535
00:33:35,974 --> 00:33:41,064
- 与“琼妮爱插翅”开始。
- 插翅给出了一个关于琼妮他妈的。

536
00:33:36,016 --> 00:33:41,063
- And "Joanie Loves Chachi" started.
- Chachi gives a fuck about Joanie.

537
00:33:44,274 --> 00:33:49,363
Cambi makes a good point.
But tonight we have some fun.

538
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:49,404
汇兑银行做一个好点的。
但今晚我们有一些乐趣。

539
00:33:49,488 --> 00:33:54,618
- Sweet suds, Mr. Zadir.
- But you know what makes a party?

540
00:33:49,524 --> 00:33:54,654
- 甜沫，Zadir先生。
- 但是，你知道是什么让一个政党？

541
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:58,622
- Fluffy whip.
- But not putting it on stuff.

542
00:33:54,744 --> 00:33:58,664
- 蓬松鞭。
- 但不是把它放在东西。

543
00:33:58,872 --> 00:34:03,961
You press the little white nozzle
and you suck on it. It's fun.

544
00:33:58,914 --> 00:34:04,004
按下白色的小喷嘴
你吸就可以了。它的乐趣。

545
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:10,259
- You mean, like, nitrous oxide?
- No. What is that?

546
00:34:05,174 --> 00:34:10,254
- 你的意思是，像，一氧化二氮？
- 号是什么？

547
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:15,344
Dooey，我们要停下来，找
有些蓬松鞭党。

548
00:34:11,426 --> 00:34:15,347
Dooey, we have to stop and get
some fluffy whip for the party.

549
00:34:15,594 --> 00:34:19,514
- 是的，先生。
- LT必须处于一个即可。

550
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:19,518
- Yes, sir.
- lt has to be in a can.

551
00:34:19,764 --> 00:34:21,644
他不能听到您的声音。

552
00:34:19,768 --> 00:34:21,687
He can't hear you.

553
00:34:21,854 --> 00:34:26,934
嘿，Dooey，告诉你妈妈
我有一个很好的时间昨晚。

554
00:34:21,895 --> 00:34:26,942
Hey, Dooey, tell your mom
I had a nice time last night.

555
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:30,988
- And your dad.
- What?

556
00:34:27,064 --> 00:34:30,984
- 和你的爸爸。
- 什么？

557
00:34:31,196 --> 00:34:35,159
- I mean, your sister.
- Good one!

558
00:34:31,234 --> 00:34:35,154
- 我的意思是，你的妹妹。
- 好一个！

559
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:39,288
- Only in a Limo.
- We nailed him.

560
00:34:35,404 --> 00:34:39,324
- 只有在豪华轿车。
- 我们钉了他。

561
00:34:39,538 --> 00:34:44,668
Disco-dicks.

562
00:34:39,574 --> 00:34:44,704
迪斯科 - 迪克斯。

563
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:49,840
- And that alien was Robin Williams.
- I'll be right back.

564
00:34:44,794 --> 00:34:49,874
- 这是外星人罗宾·威廉斯。
- 我马上就回来。

565
00:34:49,965 --> 00:34:55,137
- It's my boss's card.
- I'll take care of that.

566
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:55,134
- 这是我老板的卡。
- 我会采取照顾。

567
00:34:57,304 --> 00:35:02,394
- 操作员238，请。
- 你好，道格。

568
00:34:57,306 --> 00:35:02,436
- Operator 238, please.
- Hello, Doug.

569
00:35:02,514 --> 00:35:07,644
- 猜猜我们今晚去了。
- 上拉的一站式市场？

570
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:07,649
- Guess where we went tonight.
- The One-Stop Market on Ventura?

571
00:35:09,814 --> 00:35:13,734
没有，我之前的意思是，
你狡猾，一点信用狐狸精。

572
00:35:09,818 --> 00:35:13,739
No, I mean before that,
you sly, little credit vixen.

573
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:19,036
I give up, you nasty card-swiper.

574
00:35:13,984 --> 00:35:19,074
我放弃了，你讨厌的卡刷卡。

575
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:24,291
- The Roxbury. Come out some time.
- I would.

576
00:35:19,204 --> 00:35:24,334
- 罗克斯伯里。出来一段时间了。
- 我会的。

577
00:35:24,374 --> 00:35:27,252
But then who would approve
all the money you spend?

578
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:27,294
但是谁也批准
所有的钱你花？

579
00:35:27,503 --> 00:35:32,633
- You're always thinking of me.
- The card's good. Bye, Doug.

580
00:35:27,544 --> 00:35:32,674
- 你总是想着我。
- 该卡的不错。再见，道格。

581
00:35:36,887 --> 00:35:41,975
She approved. Approved.

582
00:35:36,924 --> 00:35:42,014
她批准。批准。

583
00:35:45,274 --> 00:35:50,354
- 甜蜜的屁股住宅，Zadir先生。
- 这是一个地方挂我的帽子。

584
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:50,359
- Sweet-ass dwelling, Mr. Zadir.
- It's a place to hang my hat.

585
00:36:01,912 --> 00:36:07,000
Look. A hundred thousand dollar
sound system, and nobody's dancing.

586
00:36:01,954 --> 00:36:07,034
看。一十万美元
音响系统，和任何人的舞蹈。

587
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:13,257
If I may congest, the pool is taking
up the prime dancing real estate.

588
00:36:08,214 --> 00:36:13,294
如果我可以充血，池正在
了首要的舞蹈房地产。

589
00:36:13,382 --> 00:36:18,512
If you put glass over the pool,
it would be like dancing on water.

590
00:36:13,424 --> 00:36:18,554
如果你把玻璃在池，
它会像跳舞的水。

591
00:36:20,722 --> 00:36:24,643
- And people love to do that.
- Let's not talk business now.

592
00:36:20,724 --> 00:36:24,644
- 而人们喜欢这样做。
- 让我们不要谈业务了。

593
00:36:24,894 --> 00:36:27,774
让我们来建立一个会议。

594
00:36:24,935 --> 00:36:27,771
Let's set up a meeting.

595
00:36:28,024 --> 00:36:33,144
安娜·妮可？装上去的。
你让我们生病。

596
00:36:28,063 --> 00:36:33,193
Anna Nicole? Put something on.
You're making us sick.

597
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:36,114
会议！

598
00:36:33,235 --> 00:36:36,071
Meeting!

599
00:36:36,363 --> 00:36:39,241
- Let's mingle.
- Right.

600
00:36:36,364 --> 00:36:39,244
- 让我们打成一片。
- 右。

601
00:36:39,491 --> 00:36:44,580
This ltalian food tastes so good.
It's, like, Mexican.

602
00:36:39,494 --> 00:36:44,574
这的义大利菜的口味这么好。
它的一样，墨西哥。

603
00:36:44,663 --> 00:36:47,583
- Could you pass me a towel, please?
- Good. How are you?

604
00:36:44,704 --> 00:36:47,584
- 你能递给我一条毛巾，好吗？
- 良好。你怎么样？

605
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:52,880
- They're right behind you.
- BMW... Vanilla, mostly.

606
00:36:47,834 --> 00:36:52,914
- 他们是在你身后。
- 宝马...香草，大多。

607
00:36:54,047 --> 00:36:56,925
- There you are.
- We got scared.

608
00:36:54,084 --> 00:36:56,964
- 你来了。
- 我们害怕了。

609
00:36:57,176 --> 00:37:01,096
- Of who? We'll kick his ass.
- No.

610
00:36:57,214 --> 00:37:01,134
- 是谁？我们会踢他的屁股。
- 号

611
00:37:01,346 --> 00:37:05,267
We got scared
somebody stole you away from us.

612
00:37:01,384 --> 00:37:05,304
我们吓坏了
有人偷了你离我们远去。

613
00:37:05,517 --> 00:37:08,437
Oh, okay.

614
00:37:05,554 --> 00:37:08,434
哦，好吧。

615
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:12,604
像其他一些女生
会偷我们而去......

616
00:37:08,687 --> 00:37:12,608
Like some other girls
would steal us away...

617
00:37:12,854 --> 00:37:17,944
哦，对了。哦！

618
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:17,905
Oh, right. Oh!

619
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:25,284
所以，做你们想去某个地方
我们单独相处的？

620
00:37:20,157 --> 00:37:25,287
So, do you guys wanna go some place
we can be alone?

621
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:29,291
No... Yes! Oh, man.

622
00:37:25,374 --> 00:37:29,294
不......是的！哦，伙计。

623
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:34,588
- Why does it taste so sweet?
- 'Cos it's like candy.

624
00:37:29,544 --> 00:37:34,624
- 为什么它的味道这么甜？
- 因为这一切就像糖果。

625
00:37:37,841 --> 00:37:42,930
These are real.
They'll be dead in a week.

626
00:37:37,884 --> 00:37:42,964
这些都是真实的。
他们会死在一个星期。

627
00:37:44,097 --> 00:37:49,228
You know what I always thought
would make a cool 'Twilight Zone"?

628
00:37:44,134 --> 00:37:49,224
你知道我一直以为
会做一个很酷的“阴阳魔界”？

629
00:37:50,394 --> 00:37:53,274
就像我们看到的图片
这位女士的， -

630
00:37:50,395 --> 00:37:53,273
Like, we see a picture
of this lady, -

631
00:37:53,524 --> 00:37:58,654
- 但这位女士，是我们刚刚
我们的照片吗？想过吗？

632
00:37:53,524 --> 00:37:58,654
- but to this lady, are we just
a picture of us? Ever think of that?

633
00:37:59,774 --> 00:38:02,654
号

634
00:37:59,822 --> 00:38:02,616
No.

635
00:38:02,904 --> 00:38:05,784
你为什么不来这里了？

636
00:38:02,908 --> 00:38:05,744
Why don't you come over here?

637
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:11,164
薇薇卡，你知道我听到
当我第一次见到你？

638
00:38:06,036 --> 00:38:11,166
Vivica, you know what I heard
when I first met you?

639
00:38:11,244 --> 00:38:16,334
什么？

640
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:16,338
What?

641
00:38:20,592 --> 00:38:23,512
- What are you doing?
- That's an ambulance.

642
00:38:20,634 --> 00:38:23,514
- 你在做什么？
- 这是一辆救护车。

643
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:28,809
Coming to take me away.
The sight of you stopped my heart.

644
00:38:23,764 --> 00:38:28,844
来带我走。
看见你停我的心脏。

645
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:35,107
Cambi, do you like blueberries
or strawberries?

646
00:38:30,014 --> 00:38:35,104
汇兑银行，你喜欢蓝莓
或草莓？

647
00:38:37,314 --> 00:38:42,444
我想知道是什么样的煎饼
命令你在早晨。

648
00:38:37,317 --> 00:38:42,447
I wanna know what kind of pancakes
to order you in the morning.

649
00:38:44,575 --> 00:38:49,663
Steve!

650
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:49,704
史蒂夫！

651
00:38:51,914 --> 00:38:55,834
- 我不知道...
- 你在做什么？

652
00:38:51,915 --> 00:38:55,794
- I was wondering...
- What are you doing?

653
00:38:56,084 --> 00:39:01,214
检查您的标签。
正如我想。在天上。

654
00:38:56,086 --> 00:39:01,216
Checking your label.
Just as I thought. Made in heaven.

655
00:39:02,301 --> 00:39:05,262
Doug. You've gotten past
the opening lines.

656
00:39:02,344 --> 00:39:05,224
道格。你已经得到了过去
开头几行。

657
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:10,517
- ls that a mirror in your pocket?
- What?

658
00:39:05,474 --> 00:39:10,554
- LS，在你的口袋里的镜子？
- 什么？

659
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:15,644
我可以看到myseIf在你的裤子。

660
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:15,647
I could see myseIf in your pants.

661
00:39:15,894 --> 00:39:20,984
如果我说你有一个好身体，
你会嫌弃我？

662
00:39:15,898 --> 00:39:20,986
If I said you had a nice body,
would you hold it against me?

663
00:39:25,282 --> 00:39:30,370
I was there. I was, like, "Emilio!"
And Doug was going cra...

664
00:39:25,284 --> 00:39:30,404
我在那里。我当时一样，“埃米利奥！”
和Doug要去CRA ...

665
00:39:31,497 --> 00:39:36,627
And Steve was, like, "Emilio!"
Oh, God, if you were only there.

666
00:39:31,534 --> 00:39:36,664
和史蒂夫是一样，“埃米利奥！”
哦，上帝，如果你只在那里。

667
00:39:37,794 --> 00:39:42,924
我觉得自己是一个自私的猪，怎么回事
关于我自己。你怎么样？

668
00:39:37,794 --> 00:39:42,925
I feel like a selfish pig, going on
about myself. What about you?

669
00:39:43,004 --> 00:39:46,924
你是哪里人？
有兄弟姐妹吗？任何家庭？

670
00:39:43,008 --> 00:39:46,887
Where are you from?
Any brothers or sisters? Any family?

671
00:39:47,137 --> 00:39:50,057
- Pets, what about pets?
- I got a cat.

672
00:39:47,174 --> 00:39:50,054
- 宠物，怎么样的宠物？
- 我有一只猫。

673
00:39:50,265 --> 00:39:53,185
Really? A cat? lnteresting.

674
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:53,184
真的吗？猫？ lnteresting。

675
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:58,524
我觉得你更象是一个爱狗之人。
也许一个博美犬。拉萨犬。

676
00:39:53,435 --> 00:39:58,524
I think of you more as a dog person.
Maybe a Pomeranian. Lhasa Apso.

677
00:39:58,644 --> 00:40:03,774
东西不多，温暖，模糊...

678
00:39:58,649 --> 00:40:03,779
Something small, warm, fuzzy...

679
00:40:04,904 --> 00:40:06,784
LS这是你第一次？

680
00:40:04,905 --> 00:40:06,782
ls this your first time?

681
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:12,079
Yes. lsn't it yours?

682
00:40:06,994 --> 00:40:12,114
是。 lsn't你的吗？

683
00:40:13,205 --> 00:40:16,083
- ls this your first time?
- What?

684
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:16,124
- LS这是你第一次？
- 什么？

685
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:21,421
Are you serious?
Oh, you're hilarious.

686
00:40:16,374 --> 00:40:21,464
你是认真的？
呵呵，你很搞笑。

687
00:40:21,547 --> 00:40:26,677
Oh, man. You're funny.
Hey, Steve? You're a funny girl.

688
00:40:21,584 --> 00:40:26,714
哦，伙计。你很有趣。
嘿，史蒂夫？你是个有趣的女孩。

689
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:35,018
All right. Hey, where are you going?

690
00:40:29,934 --> 00:40:35,054
好的。嘿，你要去哪里？

691
00:40:39,314 --> 00:40:44,403
- Oh, my God.
- Did you just? 'Cos I just...

692
00:40:39,314 --> 00:40:44,404
- 噢，我的上帝。
- 只要是吗？ “因为我只是...

693
00:40:50,784 --> 00:40:55,873
Not that it hasn't happened before.
lt was okay.

694
00:40:50,784 --> 00:40:55,914
不，它没有发生过。
LT还行。

695
00:40:55,956 --> 00:41:01,044
I'm gonna go back in and...

696
00:40:55,994 --> 00:41:01,084
我会在回去...

697
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:08,385
- Hey, Steve?
- Yeah, Doug?

698
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:08,424
- 嘿，史蒂夫？
- 是啊，道格？

699
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:17,769
- You got a number.
- We got a number.

700
00:41:12,684 --> 00:41:17,764
- 你有一个数字。
- 我们得到了一个号码。

701
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:31,364
我得到了一些伟大的办公用品
我们的新的夜总会业务。

702
00:41:26,236 --> 00:41:31,366
I got some great office supplies
for our new nightclub business.

703
00:41:31,444 --> 00:41:35,374
后LT笔记注释重要
文档。

704
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:35,370
Post-lt notes to annotate important
documents.

705
00:41:35,621 --> 00:41:39,500
Little ones. You write smaller than
me. Mugs with our names on them.

706
00:41:35,624 --> 00:41:39,544
小家伙们。你写的小于
我。马克杯与我们对他们的名字。

707
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:43,670
Yours say Doug.
Did you call Mr. Zadir?

708
00:41:39,794 --> 00:41:43,714
你说的道格。
你叫Zadir先生？

709
00:41:43,921 --> 00:41:49,009
Before you talk to a man like Mr. Zadir,
you have to have a plan of attack.

710
00:41:43,964 --> 00:41:49,044
之前你跟喜欢Zadir先生一个人，
你必须有一个行动的计划。

711
00:41:50,177 --> 00:41:55,265
I'd like to schedule a meeting.
Can you do... 12:30?

712
00:41:50,214 --> 00:41:55,304
我想安排会议。
你可以做... 1 2:30？

713
00:41:55,432 --> 00:42:00,521
Let me see.

714
00:41:55,434 --> 00:42:00,554
让我看看。

715
00:42:03,774 --> 00:42:05,654
- 我很清楚。
- 你知道吗？

716
00:42:03,774 --> 00:42:05,692
- I'm clear.
- You know what?

717
00:42:05,854 --> 00:42:09,784
让我们有一个预先的会议
我们的会议之前进行头脑风暴。

718
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:09,780
Let's have a pre-meeting
to brainstorm before our meeting.

719
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:15,160
Yeah, that way we don't
look like idiots at our meeting.

720
00:42:10,034 --> 00:42:15,154
是啊，这样我们不
看起来像白痴在我们的会议。

721
00:42:17,324 --> 00:42:22,414
- 对不起。注册的封闭。
- 对不起。

722
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:22,376
- I'm sorry. Register's closed.
- Sorry.

723
00:42:24,586 --> 00:42:29,716
Mr. Butabi,
where's the other cash register?

724
00:42:24,624 --> 00:42:29,754
Butabi先生，
哪来的其他收银？

725
00:42:31,885 --> 00:42:36,974
Steve? I was just thinking. Dad
would be really proud of us right now.

726
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:37,014
史蒂夫？我只是在想。爸
将是非常自豪我们的现在。

727
00:42:38,183 --> 00:42:43,230
What are you idiots doing? I pay you
to take money and push a button.

728
00:42:38,184 --> 00:42:43,264
什么是你白痴在干什么？我付你
拿钱，并按下一个按钮。

729
00:42:44,398 --> 00:42:48,360
Are your delicate fingers injured?

730
00:42:44,434 --> 00:42:48,364
是你纤细的手指受伤了吗？

731
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:52,531
- We're working our asses off.
- Our weeks filling up quick.

732
00:42:48,614 --> 00:42:52,534
- 我们正在我们的驴了。
- 我们的星期填满快。

733
00:42:52,781 --> 00:42:56,702
We've made
important business contacts.

734
00:42:52,784 --> 00:42:56,704
我们已经取得了
重要的业务联系。

735
00:42:56,952 --> 00:42:59,830
Dancing the Macarena
with Donald Trump?

736
00:42:56,954 --> 00:42:59,834
跳舞的Macarena
与唐纳德特朗普？

737
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:03,959
You're always telling us
to do something with our lives.

738
00:43:00,084 --> 00:43:04,004
你总是告诉我们
做一些与我们的生活。

739
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:09,339
You never support us or care about
what's important to us, right?

740
00:43:04,254 --> 00:43:09,374
你永远支持我们或关心
什么是重要的我们，对不对？

741
00:43:09,423 --> 00:43:14,511
- Yeah... for the most part.
- Even your brother isn't convinced.

742
00:43:09,464 --> 00:43:14,554
- 是啊......大部分。
- 即使你弟弟不服气。

743
00:43:15,721 --> 00:43:20,767
Why? He uses his brain, unlike you.
You're a loser! New policy.

744
00:43:15,724 --> 00:43:20,804
为什么呢？他用他的大脑，不像你。
你是个失败者！新政策。

745
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:27,064
没有更多的俱乐部。
没错！你的生活是零售。

746
00:43:21,977 --> 00:43:27,065
No more clubs.
Yes! Your life is retail.

747
00:43:28,233 --> 00:43:31,111
- Go clean the stockroom.
- You know what?

748
00:43:28,234 --> 00:43:31,114
- 去清理库房。
- 你知道吗？

749
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:36,492
Not only will we not clean out
the stockroom, we're out of here!

750
00:43:31,364 --> 00:43:36,484
我们不仅不清理掉
库房，我们离开这里吧！

751
00:43:37,614 --> 00:43:42,744
怎么样的库房？

752
00:43:37,618 --> 00:43:42,748
What about the stockroom?

753
00:43:42,831 --> 00:43:45,709
We don't need you.
We made huge-ass contacts last night.

754
00:43:42,834 --> 00:43:45,704
我们不需要你。
我们取得了巨大的屁股接触昨晚。

755
00:43:45,954 --> 00:43:49,884
再加上我们遇到这些女孩，爸爸。

756
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:49,838
Plus we met these girls, Dad.

757
00:43:50,088 --> 00:43:54,009
We'll make it without you.
You'lI see.

758
00:43:50,134 --> 00:43:54,054
我们将使它没有你。
You'lI见。

759
00:43:54,259 --> 00:43:59,389
I'lI see when you come home, begging
for food and shelter. Morons!

760
00:43:54,304 --> 00:43:59,424
当你回家I'lI看到，乞讨
对食物和住所。白痴！

761
00:43:59,473 --> 00:44:04,603
Steve? You're an ass, Doug.
You want to go to the beach later?

762
00:43:59,514 --> 00:44:04,604
史蒂夫？你是驴，道格。
你想要去海边以后呢？

763
00:44:06,813 --> 00:44:10,734
I know a beach where you don't have
to wear a bathing suit.

764
00:44:06,814 --> 00:44:10,734
我知道一个海滩，在那里你没有
穿泳衣。

765
00:44:10,984 --> 00:44:16,114
- Plus with my milky white skin...
- This is a major family crisis.

766
00:44:10,984 --> 00:44:16,114
- 加上我的乳白色的皮肤...
- 这是一个重大的家庭危机。

767
00:44:27,664 --> 00:44:32,794
只要给我打个电话，如果你想
出门。或者只是叫我反正。

768
00:44:27,668 --> 00:44:32,756
Just give me a call if you wanna
go out. Or just call me anyway.

769
00:45:12,504 --> 00:45:16,341
You notice we forgot to ask her
something. That's weird.

770
00:45:12,504 --> 00:45:16,424
您会注意到，我们忘了问她
东西。这是奇怪的。

771
00:45:16,633 --> 00:45:21,722
We're in serious relationships right
now, and our ladies can trust us.

772
00:45:16,674 --> 00:45:21,764
我们在认真的关系正确
现在，我们的女士们可以信任我们。

773
00:45:21,847 --> 00:45:26,977
Why go out for burgers,
when you got steak at home?

774
00:45:21,884 --> 00:45:27,014
为什么出去的汉堡，
当你在家里有牛排吗？

775
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:40,404
- 你没事吧？
- 是啊，挺好的。

776
00:45:36,487 --> 00:45:40,407
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, fine.

777
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:44,574
- 道格和史蒂夫Butabi。
- 你是兄弟？

778
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:44,578
- Doug and Steve Butabi.
- You're brothers?

779
00:45:44,824 --> 00:45:49,954
- 我们都进不了的现在。
- 你的名字不在名单上。

780
00:45:44,828 --> 00:45:49,917
- We can't get into that right now.
- Your names are not on the list.

781
00:45:51,043 --> 00:45:52,961
We have a meeting.

782
00:45:51,084 --> 00:45:52,964
我们有一个会议。

783
00:45:53,128 --> 00:45:58,217
- Doug, Mr. Zadir!
- Security.

784
00:45:53,174 --> 00:45:58,294
- 道格，Zadir先生！
- 安全性。

785
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:05,432
- Dooey... Yeah. Up top.
- Main man.

786
00:46:01,514 --> 00:46:05,434
- Dooey ...是啊。往上顶。
- 主的人。

787
00:46:05,682 --> 00:46:10,812
- Raging party last night.
- ls that what my mother told you?

788
00:46:05,684 --> 00:46:10,814
- 愤怒的党昨晚。
- LS是我妈妈告诉你的？

789
00:46:10,894 --> 00:46:14,814
- 什么？
- 蓬松的鞭子是一个很大的打击。

790
00:46:10,896 --> 00:46:14,817
- What?
- The fluffy whip was a big hit.

791
00:46:15,064 --> 00:46:20,154
- 我被派去寻找更多。
- 你，先生，是一个派对动物。

792
00:46:15,067 --> 00:46:20,155
- I was sent out looking for more.
- You, sir, are a party animal.

793
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:25,410
It's been great spending quality
time, but we're meeting Mr. Zadir.

794
00:46:20,284 --> 00:46:25,404
这是伟大的消费质量
时间，但我们要去见Zadir先生。

795
00:46:25,494 --> 00:46:29,414
Zadir was drunk last night.
He doesn't even remember you.

796
00:46:25,494 --> 00:46:29,414
Zadir喝醉了昨晚。
他甚至不记得你。

797
00:46:29,664 --> 00:46:34,754
你以为你是第一个失败者
我已经在周一摆脱？

798
00:46:29,665 --> 00:46:34,753
You think you're the first losers
I've had to get rid of on a Monday?

799
00:46:34,837 --> 00:46:39,967
- Are we being blown off?
- Actually, you're being kicked out.

800
00:46:34,874 --> 00:46:40,004
- 难道我们被吹走？
- 其实，你被踢出。

801
00:46:50,477 --> 00:46:55,607
That doesn't feel good at all...

802
00:46:50,514 --> 00:46:55,604
那感觉并不好所有...

803
00:46:55,732 --> 00:46:59,653
- What's going on?
- Just some trespassers.

804
00:46:55,734 --> 00:46:59,654
- 这是怎么回事？
- 只是一些入侵者。

805
00:46:59,903 --> 00:47:05,033
- And the boys from last night?
- I haven't located them yet.

806
00:46:59,904 --> 00:47:05,034
- 而从昨晚的男生？
- 我已经不在他们呢。

807
00:47:06,154 --> 00:47:09,034
Dooey，你刚才抢了我的屁股？

808
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,037
Dooey, did you just grab my ass?

809
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:14,374
从我站在那里，
这是一个物理上是不可能。

810
00:47:09,288 --> 00:47:14,376
From where I'm standing,
that's a physical impossibility.

811
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:19,590
I know your tricks, Dooey.

812
00:47:14,504 --> 00:47:19,624
我知道你的把戏，Dooey。

813
00:47:30,142 --> 00:47:34,021
Maybe we should just go back to work.

814
00:47:30,144 --> 00:47:34,064
也许我们应该回去上班。

815
00:47:34,313 --> 00:47:39,401
Maybe we should go to college, not
put gel in our hair and wear jeans!

816
00:47:34,314 --> 00:47:39,394
也许我们应该去上大学，不
把凝胶在我们的头发和穿牛仔裤！

817
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:44,654
- 让我们做的是，史蒂夫！
- 对不起。

818
00:47:39,526 --> 00:47:44,656
- Let's do that, Steve!
- Sorry.

819
00:47:48,911 --> 00:47:52,831
Cambi's number.

820
00:47:48,914 --> 00:47:52,834
汇兑银行的数量。

821
00:47:53,081 --> 00:47:58,170
- We had a pretty sweet time, right?
- Sweet-ass time.

822
00:47:53,084 --> 00:47:58,164
- 我们有一个非常甜蜜的时间，对不对？
- 甜蜜的屁股时间。

823
00:48:14,937 --> 00:48:18,857
So you do travel to places
other than Japan.

824
00:48:14,974 --> 00:48:18,894
所以，你做旅游的地方
日本以外。

825
00:48:19,144 --> 00:48:24,274
- 这些火辣是甜的。
- 甜蜜的屁股甜蜜。

826
00:48:19,149 --> 00:48:24,279
- These hotties are sweet.
- Sweet ass sweet.

827
00:48:24,363 --> 00:48:28,242
- Who is it?
- Just a bunch of pound signs.

828
00:48:24,364 --> 00:48:28,284
- 你是谁？
- 只是一堆井号。

829
00:48:28,534 --> 00:48:33,614
- 你做得对吗？
- 你必须打的井号。

830
00:48:28,534 --> 00:48:33,622
- Are you doing it right?
- You have to hit the pound sign.

831
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:40,963
You have to put in our number
and then hit the pound sign.

832
00:48:35,834 --> 00:48:40,964
你必须把我们的数
然后打的井号。

833
00:48:43,131 --> 00:48:46,009
Excuse me, Bill Nye, the science guy.

834
00:48:43,134 --> 00:48:46,004
对不起，比尔·奈伊，科学的家伙。

835
00:48:46,254 --> 00:48:51,384
这是一个甜蜜的表演，太。

836
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:51,348
That's a sweet show, too.

837
00:48:52,432 --> 00:48:57,604
Cambi, it's your boyfriend.
Look, I need to see you.

838
00:48:52,514 --> 00:48:57,644
汇兑银行，这是你的男朋友。
你看，我要见你。

839
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:02,651
- I'm at the Skybar.
- We'll be rig there.

840
00:48:58,774 --> 00:49:02,694
- 我在Skybar酒吧。
- 我们将钻机在那里。

841
00:49:02,901 --> 00:49:08,031
- Nice.
- I was focused the whole time.

842
00:49:02,944 --> 00:49:08,074
- 尼斯。
- 我是专注的全部时间。

843
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:12,074
你有一个很好的时间上晚？

844
00:49:08,157 --> 00:49:12,035
Did you have a good time last night?

845
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:16,244
我有一个伟大的时间。
我认为我们已经达到了一个点 -

846
00:49:12,327 --> 00:49:16,248
I had a great time.
I think we've reached a point -

847
00:49:16,494 --> 00:49:20,414
- 在那里我可以叫你口水巾
并留下了“ICA”。

848
00:49:16,498 --> 00:49:20,419
- where I can call you Viv
and leave out the "ica".

849
00:49:20,664 --> 00:49:25,754
你想挂出
或做什么，我们昨天晚上做了？

850
00:49:20,669 --> 00:49:25,757
You wanna hang out
or do what we did last night?

851
00:49:25,883 --> 00:49:31,013
- Or eat, then do what we did?
- Sounds good.

852
00:49:25,884 --> 00:49:31,014
- 或吃，然后做我们所做的？
- 听起来不错。

853
00:49:32,097 --> 00:49:37,186
- Have your boarding passes ready.
- You'lI have to check your bag.

854
00:49:32,134 --> 00:49:37,264
- 让你的登机牌准备好了。
- You'lI要检查你的包。

855
00:49:38,353 --> 00:49:43,484
The movie on this flight will be...
I can't think of any more.

856
00:49:38,394 --> 00:49:43,524
在这次飞行的电影将是...
我想不出任何更多。

857
00:49:45,652 --> 00:49:50,741
- Where's your car?
- Our dad got mad, took it away.

858
00:49:45,694 --> 00:49:50,784
- 哪里是你的车吗？
- 我们的爸爸生气了，把它拿走。

859
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:56,997
We used to work for him, but we quit
today. Actually, we're unemployed.

860
00:49:51,954 --> 00:49:57,034
我们曾经为他工作，但我们不干
今天。其实，我们是失业。

861
00:49:58,204 --> 00:50:03,294
- 你不Zadir先生工作？
- 我们刚认识他的最后一晚。

862
00:49:58,207 --> 00:50:03,295
- You don't work with Mr. Zadir?
- We just met him last night.

863
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:08,550
- We will be. So no, but yes.
- If we ever get to see him again.

864
00:50:03,424 --> 00:50:08,544
- 我们将。因此，没有，但肯定的。
- 如果我们曾经得到再次见到他。

865
00:50:14,894 --> 00:50:19,974
- 你不需要登机牌。
- 获取离我们远去。

866
00:50:14,932 --> 00:50:19,978
- You don't need boarding passes.
- Get away from us.

867
00:50:20,062 --> 00:50:24,024
- You guys are a big waste of time.
- Como what?

868
00:50:20,104 --> 00:50:24,024
- 你们是时间的巨大浪费。
- 科莫什么？

869
00:50:24,233 --> 00:50:29,363
- Steve, you're a jerkoff.
- I'm glad you shared that with me.

870
00:50:24,274 --> 00:50:29,404
- 史蒂夫，你是头晕晕的。
- 我很高兴你分享了我。

871
00:50:29,446 --> 00:50:34,535
- It's a big step for both of us.
- Consider last night a favor.

872
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:34,574
- 这是我们俩的一大步。
- 考虑昨晚的忙。

873
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:38,580
Now do us a favor.
Never talk to us again!

874
00:50:34,704 --> 00:50:38,624
现在，帮一下忙。
千万别跟我们了！

875
00:50:38,872 --> 00:50:41,708
- What did we do? We'll change.
- You can't change.

876
00:50:38,874 --> 00:50:41,754
- 我们做了什么？我们会改变。
- 你不能改变的。

877
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,879
You are ugly, pathetic losers.

878
00:50:42,004 --> 00:50:45,924
你是丑陋的，可怜的失败者。

879
00:50:46,171 --> 00:50:51,260
I can't believe we actually had sex
with these asswads!

880
00:50:46,174 --> 00:50:51,254
我简直不敢相信我们居然发生了性关系
这些asswads！

881
00:50:51,384 --> 00:50:56,514
这就是问题所在。笨人不佳
看起来一模一样的笨人丰富。

882
00:50:51,385 --> 00:50:56,515
That's the problem. Poor schmucks
look just the same as rich schmucks.

883
00:51:10,112 --> 00:51:15,242
- No... Yes...
- This is the worst day of my life.

884
00:51:10,154 --> 00:51:15,284
- 不......是的......
- 这是我一生中最糟糕的一天。

885
00:51:15,325 --> 00:51:19,246
I'd really appreciate it
if you didn't talk to me right now.

886
00:51:15,364 --> 00:51:19,284
我会很感激
如果你不跟我说话，现在。

887
00:51:19,496 --> 00:51:22,374
I don't know how to respond to that.

888
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:22,414
我不知道该如何作出回应。

889
00:51:22,624 --> 00:51:27,754
Big surprise. You don't know how to
work the clubs, talk to the ladies.

890
00:51:22,664 --> 00:51:27,794
大惊喜。你不知道如何
工作的俱乐部，跟我们的女士们。

891
00:51:29,964 --> 00:51:35,054
你只懂得问我
怎么做的一切！

892
00:51:29,965 --> 00:51:35,053
You only know how to ask me
how to do everything!

893
00:51:35,174 --> 00:51:39,094
这就是为什么一切都已经
错了。你抱着我。

894
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:39,099
That's why everything has gone
wrong. You're holding me back.

895
00:51:39,344 --> 00:51:44,474
你像这个东西绑在我的
腿，在这个链条拖动的事情。

896
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:44,521
You're like this thing tied to my
leg, this dragging thing on a chain.

897
00:51:48,692 --> 00:51:52,654
- A lead weight?
- Yes, thank you. But not anymore!

898
00:51:48,734 --> 00:51:52,654
- 一个铅块？
- 是的，谢谢你。但现在不是了！

899
00:51:52,863 --> 00:51:55,782
Nothing. That's all. Nothing.

900
00:51:52,904 --> 00:51:55,784
什么都没有。这就是全部。什么都没有。

901
00:51:55,991 --> 00:52:01,121
You can't blame me. Today was just
a series of random events gone awry.

902
00:51:56,034 --> 00:52:01,164
你可别怪我。今天只是
一系列的随机事件出了错。

903
00:52:02,247 --> 00:52:07,377
Maybe they wouldn't go awry
if I had someone next to me with a brain!

904
00:52:02,284 --> 00:52:07,414
也许他们就不会出差错
如果我有一个人在我旁边用脑！

905
00:52:08,504 --> 00:52:13,634
You know what? Dad was right.
You are a loser.

906
00:52:08,544 --> 00:52:13,674
你知道吗？爸爸是对的。
你是一个失败者。

907
00:52:14,801 --> 00:52:19,932
You know what, Steve?
I lied. You're not good looking.

908
00:52:14,804 --> 00:52:19,924
你知道吗，史蒂夫？
我撒了谎。你不是好找。

909
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:24,974
你说什么？我听不见
事情从低到地面。

910
00:52:21,058 --> 00:52:25,020
Did you say something? I can't hear
things from that low to the ground.

911
00:52:25,224 --> 00:52:30,354
- 我考虑你的前兄弟。
- 我不在乎。

912
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:30,359
- Consider me your ex-brother.
- I don't care.

913
00:52:30,442 --> 00:52:34,363
Care about this?
You want the real thing?

914
00:52:30,444 --> 00:52:34,364
关心这个？
你想真实的东西？

915
00:52:34,571 --> 00:52:36,490
- Do you want..?
- Stop talking to me.

916
00:52:34,614 --> 00:52:36,494
- 你想..？
- 停止跟我说话。

917
00:52:36,657 --> 00:52:41,745
Fine. My pleasure.

918
00:52:36,694 --> 00:52:41,784
精细。我的荣幸。

919
00:53:23,579 --> 00:53:28,709
Little Post-lts, you little idiot.

920
00:53:23,624 --> 00:53:28,744
小后LTS，你这个小笨蛋。

921
00:53:29,835 --> 00:53:34,965
Get out, 'cos I hate you.

922
00:53:29,874 --> 00:53:35,004
滚出去，“因为我恨你。

923
00:53:42,347 --> 00:53:47,478
- You should take a lesson from it.
- Grieco.

924
00:53:42,384 --> 00:53:47,514
- 你应该汲取教训。
- GRIECO。

925
00:54:12,586 --> 00:54:17,674
- You'll be very happy with these.
- How long do they last?

926
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:17,714
- 你会很高兴与这些。
- 多久他们持续多久？

927
00:54:18,842 --> 00:54:22,763
They last forever. They're silk.
They'll always be in bloom.

928
00:54:18,884 --> 00:54:22,804
他们永远持续下去。他们是丝绸。
他们会永远盛开。

929
00:54:23,013 --> 00:54:28,143
They'll never die, never change.
Never say you're not good looking.

930
00:54:23,054 --> 00:54:28,144
他们永远不会死，永远不会改变。
永远不要说你不是好找。

931
00:54:30,354 --> 00:54:35,484
They'll always be in your room, not
suddenly move to the guest house.

932
00:54:30,354 --> 00:54:35,484
他们会永远在你的房间，不
突然移动到招待所。

933
00:54:36,614 --> 00:54:41,734
东西已经上来了。对不起。

934
00:54:36,652 --> 00:54:41,740
Something has come up. Excuse me.

935
00:54:41,824 --> 00:54:46,904
- 所有的客户都郁闷。
- 这只是我怀念道格。

936
00:54:41,824 --> 00:54:46,912
- All the customers are depressed.
- It's just that I miss Doug.

937
00:54:48,074 --> 00:54:52,004
- 他在招待所。这是一个豪宅。
- 有没有电缆。

938
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:52,000
- He's in the guest house. It's a mansion.
- There's no cable.

939
00:54:52,209 --> 00:54:57,297
- Yes, there is. They have Cinemax.
- But there's no HBO. God!

940
00:54:52,254 --> 00:54:57,334
- 是的，有。他们有Cinemax的。
- 但有没有HBO。上帝！

941
00:55:01,593 --> 00:55:05,514
- Feel it right here. Squeeze.
- Hey, Steve.

942
00:55:01,634 --> 00:55:05,554
- 感觉它在这里。挤。
- 嘿，史蒂夫。

943
00:55:05,764 --> 00:55:09,726
I heard about your brother.

944
00:55:05,804 --> 00:55:09,724
我听说你哥哥。

945
00:55:09,974 --> 00:55:15,104
- 所以，当我们要怎么出去？
- 我知道菠菜包裹的地方。

946
00:55:09,977 --> 00:55:15,107
- So when are we gonna go out?
- I know a place with spinach wraps.

947
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:20,279
I know you've had you heart set on
this, but the truth is, I'm a rebel.

948
00:55:15,194 --> 00:55:20,274
我知道你有你心脏设置
这一点，但事实是，我是一个反叛者。

949
00:55:21,444 --> 00:55:25,364
你是这样的
甜美女孩从隔壁的类型。

950
00:55:21,488 --> 00:55:25,325
You're like this
sweet-girl-from-next-door type.

951
00:55:25,614 --> 00:55:30,704
我去上大学。翻译：醉
狂欢偶尔克里夫笔记。

952
00:55:25,617 --> 00:55:30,706
I go to college. Translation: Drunken
orgies with occasional Cliff notes.

953
00:55:32,914 --> 00:55:38,044
LT听起来不错，但我刚刚出来
这个非常严肃的关系。

954
00:55:32,916 --> 00:55:38,005
lt sounds good, but I just got out
of this very serious relationship.

955
00:55:38,088 --> 00:55:42,050
I have to nurse my emotional wounds.

956
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:42,054
我要吃奶我的情绪创伤。

957
00:55:42,259 --> 00:55:46,221
That could take till... Saturday.

958
00:55:42,304 --> 00:55:46,224
这可能需要到...星期六。

959
00:55:46,471 --> 00:55:51,518
That's perfect. Your dad got us tickets
for David Copperfield this Saturday.

960
00:55:46,474 --> 00:55:51,554
那很完美。你爸爸把我们的机票
大卫科波菲尔这个星期六。

961
00:55:51,684 --> 00:55:56,814
这会是这么多的乐趣
看东西出现和消失。

962
00:55:51,685 --> 00:55:56,815
It's gonna be so much fun
to see things appear and disappear.

963
00:56:02,112 --> 00:56:07,201
I'lI see you.

964
00:56:02,114 --> 00:56:07,234
I'lI见到你。

965
00:56:09,369 --> 00:56:14,458
- Oh, man. Great glutes.
- I don't care.

966
00:56:09,414 --> 00:56:14,494
- 哦，伙计。大臀部。
- 我不在乎。

967
00:56:41,734 --> 00:56:46,864
- 这是昂贵的。
- 我得走了。

968
00:56:41,735 --> 00:56:46,865
- That's expensive.
- Gotta go.

969
00:56:47,991 --> 00:56:53,080
Who decorates like this?
Steve, come on.

970
00:56:47,994 --> 00:56:53,114
谁装饰这样吗？
史蒂夫，来吧。

971
00:57:24,484 --> 00:57:29,574
“业务。人际关系
在管理“。

972
00:57:24,486 --> 00:57:29,575
"Business. Human Relationships
in Management."

973
00:57:30,742 --> 00:57:34,621
"Covers the development of..."

974
00:57:30,744 --> 00:57:34,664
“涵盖的发展......”

975
00:57:34,872 --> 00:57:38,792
Here's one. "Business Computer
Systems." That's a good one.

976
00:57:34,914 --> 00:57:38,834
这里有一个。 “商务电脑
系统，“这是一个很好的一个。

977
00:57:39,042 --> 00:57:44,131
Machines are Doug's thing.
I'm more of a people person.

978
00:57:39,084 --> 00:57:44,174
机器是道格的事。
我是一个人的人。

979
00:57:45,299 --> 00:57:50,387
A business man must have knowledge
of computers. Come on.

980
00:57:45,344 --> 00:57:50,424
一个商人必须具备的知识
电脑。来吧。

981
00:57:51,555 --> 00:57:56,685
Here's another one.
"Venture Management."

982
00:57:51,594 --> 00:57:56,684
这里是另外一个。
“风险管理”。

983
00:57:56,810 --> 00:58:01,940
Gosh, Emily, school?
I'lI have to read, and homework...

984
00:57:56,814 --> 00:58:01,934
天哪，艾米丽，学校？
I'lI必须阅读和家庭作业...

985
00:58:03,064 --> 00:58:06,984
老师说：“你分享
，与班上其他同学？“

986
00:58:03,066 --> 00:58:06,987
Teachers saying: "Would you share
that with the rest of the class?"

987
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:10,114
难道你要我少角质？

988
00:58:07,237 --> 00:58:10,115
Do you want me to be less horny?

989
00:58:10,364 --> 00:58:15,454
- 不，这不会是一件好事。
- 看，这就是我们要做的。

990
00:58:10,365 --> 00:58:15,454
- No, that wouldn't be good.
- Look, here's what we do.

991
00:58:15,574 --> 00:58:20,704
首先，我们结合了卖场，好吗？
然后，我们可以添加家具。

992
00:58:15,579 --> 00:58:20,667
First, we combine the stores, okay?
Then we can add the furniture.

993
00:58:22,836 --> 00:58:25,714
Recliners and sofa beds...

994
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:25,754
躺椅和沙发床...

995
00:58:25,964 --> 00:58:29,885
- And end tables and...
- Chairs.

996
00:58:26,004 --> 00:58:29,924
- 和最终表和...
- 椅子。

997
00:58:30,135 --> 00:58:35,265
- Oh, yes, chairs.
- Ottomans.

998
00:58:30,174 --> 00:58:35,304
- 哦，对了，椅子。
- 脚垫。

999
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:40,479
Yes, ottomans. We're gonna be bigger
than lkea... Home Depot.

1000
00:58:35,394 --> 00:58:40,474
是的，沙发椅。我们要去更大
比lkea ...家得宝。

1001
00:58:45,814 --> 00:58:50,904
lkea！

1002
00:58:45,818 --> 00:58:50,906
lkea!

1003
00:58:59,373 --> 00:59:04,461
I think we're moving way too fast.
You're talking like we're married.

1004
00:58:59,374 --> 00:59:04,504
我认为，我们正在移动太快。
你说的一样，我们已经结婚了。

1005
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:11,718
Oh, Steve.
You just made me so happy.

1006
00:59:06,674 --> 00:59:11,754
哦，史蒂夫。
你刚才让我太高兴了。

1007
00:59:11,844 --> 00:59:15,764
What? No, I don't mean that.

1008
00:59:11,884 --> 00:59:15,804
什么？不，我不是那个意思。

1009
00:59:16,014 --> 00:59:21,186
It's just that I don't...

1010
00:59:16,054 --> 00:59:21,184
只是，我不...

1011
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:29,524
好吧。

1012
00:59:24,398 --> 00:59:29,528
Okay.

1013
00:59:38,994 --> 00:59:44,124
道格，如果我没有记错的话，
这个地方已经得到它怎么回事！

1014
00:59:38,996 --> 00:59:44,084
Doug, if I'm not mistaken,
this place has got it going on!

1015
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:49,131
I owe you big time for inviting me.

1016
00:59:45,254 --> 00:59:49,174
我欠你大的时候邀请我。

1017
00:59:49,381 --> 00:59:54,511
Who wants to dance?
I call this one the sprinkler.

1018
00:59:49,424 --> 00:59:54,554
谁愿意跳舞吗？
我称它是自动喷水灭火。

1019
00:59:56,722 --> 01:00:01,768
You think it would be okay to wear
this to your brother's wedding?

1020
00:59:56,724 --> 01:00:01,804
你认为它会好起来的穿
这对你哥哥的婚礼吗？

1021
01:00:01,934 --> 01:00:07,064
你哥哥的婚礼上，男人。
你打算怎么穿？

1022
01:00:01,935 --> 01:00:07,065
Your brother's wedding, man.
What are you gonna wear?

1023
01:00:07,107 --> 01:00:12,196
You have to hand it to Steve.
That Emily is the perfect woman.

1024
01:00:07,144 --> 01:00:12,234
你必须把它交给史蒂夫。
艾米莉是一个完美的女人。

1025
01:00:12,362 --> 01:00:17,493
Strong legs, tight stomach,
positive mental attitude...

1026
01:00:12,364 --> 01:00:17,494
壮腿，肚子紧，
积极的心态...

1027
01:00:17,574 --> 01:00:22,664
- 她真的可以让你的轨道上。
- 闭嘴..！ ldiot。

1028
01:00:17,576 --> 01:00:22,664
- She can really keep you on track.
- Shut up..! ldiot.

1029
01:00:25,914 --> 01:00:29,834
只是因为你和你的兄弟
有问题， -

1030
01:00:25,918 --> 01:00:29,796
Just because you and your brother
are having problems, -

1031
01:00:30,047 --> 01:00:35,135
- that's no reason to refer to my
intellect in a diminutive manner.

1032
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:35,174
- 这是没有理由看我的
智力在一个身材矮小的方式。

1033
01:00:36,303 --> 01:00:41,433
I'm sorry. It's just...

1034
01:00:36,344 --> 01:00:41,434
对不起。这只是...

1035
01:00:41,517 --> 01:00:45,479
Can we not talk
about my brother for a second?

1036
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:45,474
我们不能谈
我弟弟一秒钟？

1037
01:00:45,724 --> 01:00:50,854
- 1 0-4。边界集。
- 谢谢你。

1038
01:00:45,729 --> 01:00:50,859
- 10-4. Boundary set.
- Thank you.

1039
01:00:50,901 --> 01:00:55,989
I'm having a hell of a time.

1040
01:00:50,944 --> 01:00:56,024
我在的时候一个地狱。

1041
01:01:02,412 --> 01:01:07,543
At this moment, I want to make
a toast to Steve and Emily, -

1042
01:01:02,414 --> 01:01:07,544
在这一刻，我想使
举杯史蒂夫和Emily， -

1043
01:01:07,624 --> 01:01:12,714
- 后天谁
将先生和夫人史蒂芬Butabi。

1044
01:01:07,626 --> 01:01:12,673
- who after tomorrow
will be Mr. and Mrs. Steven Butabi.

1045
01:01:12,798 --> 01:01:16,718
- Emily Sanderson-Butabi.
- Whoever.

1046
01:01:12,834 --> 01:01:16,764
- 艾米莉桑德森-Butabi。
- 谁。

1047
01:01:16,969 --> 01:01:22,099
I would like to thank my parents,
who came in all the way from Maine.

1048
01:01:17,014 --> 01:01:22,134
我要感谢我的父母，
谁排在从缅因州一路。

1049
01:01:25,352 --> 01:01:30,482
- Despite Mom's sciatica.
- Terrific, sir.

1050
01:01:25,354 --> 01:01:30,474
- 尽管妈妈的坐骨神经痛。
- 太棒了，先生。

1051
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:36,734
和Butabis，谁进来
从Yayman一路。

1052
01:01:31,608 --> 01:01:36,738
And the Butabis, who came in
all the way from Yayman.

1053
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:41,869
- Yemen.
- And that's not the only union.

1054
01:01:36,824 --> 01:01:41,904
- 也门。
- 而这还不是唯一的工会。

1055
01:01:42,034 --> 01:01:47,164
- 我们得到了一个新的灯泡工厂店。
- 植物灯店。好多了。

1056
01:01:42,035 --> 01:01:47,166
- We got a new lamp-plant store.
- Plant-lamp store. Much better.

1057
01:01:48,292 --> 01:01:52,171
- Seriously, it sounds better.
- Steve?

1058
01:01:48,294 --> 01:01:52,214
- 说真的，这听起来更好。
- 史蒂夫？

1059
01:01:52,462 --> 01:01:55,299
You want to make a toast?

1060
01:01:52,464 --> 01:01:55,344
你想敬酒？

1061
01:01:55,549 --> 01:02:00,637
I think you should make a toast.
All the men are making toasts.

1062
01:01:55,594 --> 01:02:00,674
我觉得你应该做一个烤面包。
所有的男人都在祝酒词。

1063
01:02:03,932 --> 01:02:08,979
Okay, I just want to say,
"What's up, Grandma, Grandpa?"

1064
01:02:03,934 --> 01:02:09,014
好吧，我只想说，
“怎么了，奶奶，爷爷？”

1065
01:02:10,184 --> 01:02:15,274
和其他两位老人，
“怎么了？”

1066
01:02:10,189 --> 01:02:15,277
And to the other two old people,
"What's up?"

1067
01:02:15,402 --> 01:02:19,323
- Yeah, you.
- Very nice.

1068
01:02:15,404 --> 01:02:19,324
- 是啊，你。
- 很不错的。

1069
01:02:19,573 --> 01:02:24,703
Steve is thrilled
that this family's coming together.

1070
01:02:19,574 --> 01:02:24,704
史蒂夫非常高兴
这家的撞在了一起。

1071
01:02:24,745 --> 01:02:29,833
I'd like to show you some of our
business plans for after the merger.

1072
01:02:24,784 --> 01:02:29,874
我想向您展示一些我们的
业务计划，合并后。

1073
01:02:35,214 --> 01:02:40,260
Dad? ls there any way
we can cancel this whole thing?

1074
01:02:35,214 --> 01:02:40,294
爸爸？ LS有什么办法
我们可以取消这件事？

1075
01:02:40,385 --> 01:02:45,516
- Yes... No!
- That is so funny.

1076
01:02:40,424 --> 01:02:45,554
- 是的......不！
- 那是太有趣了。

1077
01:02:46,683 --> 01:02:51,814
But it's like Emily turned out to be
this whole different other person.

1078
01:02:46,684 --> 01:02:51,814
但它像艾米丽竟然是
这个完全不同的其他人。

1079
01:02:51,894 --> 01:02:54,774
让我来解释一下。

1080
01:02:51,897 --> 01:02:54,775
Let me explain something.

1081
01:02:55,024 --> 01:03:00,154
餐饮供应商已支付。
你的祖父母来了。

1082
01:02:55,025 --> 01:03:00,155
The caterer has been paid.
Your grandparents came.

1083
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:04,154
所有的人都紧张
他们的婚礼的前一天晚上。

1084
01:03:00,239 --> 01:03:04,159
All men are nervous
the night before their wedding.

1085
01:03:04,404 --> 01:03:09,494
所有的球员都是那种紧张和
希望她吃肉毒中毒的可以吗？

1086
01:03:04,409 --> 01:03:09,498
All guys are nervous and kind of
hope she eats a can of botulism?

1087
01:03:11,667 --> 01:03:16,797
She could hang out with a deer and
accidentally be shot by a hunter.

1088
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:16,834
她可以用鹿挂出，
不慎被猎人被枪毙。

1089
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:20,801
You know, when she's sleeping she
makes that nose whistle sound, -

1090
01:03:16,924 --> 01:03:20,844
你知道，当她睡觉，她
使该鼻鸣笛声， -

1091
01:03:21,051 --> 01:03:26,139
- and you want to ram her toothbrush
up her nostril into her skull.

1092
01:03:21,094 --> 01:03:26,174
- 你想猛撞她的牙刷
她的鼻孔入她的头骨。

1093
01:03:29,434 --> 01:03:34,523
These are perfectly normal feelings.

1094
01:03:29,434 --> 01:03:34,524
这是完全正常的感情。

1095
01:03:40,904 --> 01:03:46,034
Doug, are you there? It's Steve.

1096
01:03:40,904 --> 01:03:46,034
道格，你在吗？这是史蒂夫。

1097
01:03:55,460 --> 01:04:00,591
Hi, you've reached Doug Butabi.
I'm outside living it up.

1098
01:03:55,504 --> 01:04:00,634
嗨，你已经达到了道格Butabi。
我在外面活起来。

1099
01:04:00,674 --> 01:04:03,552
Unlike my pussywhipped brother -

1100
01:04:00,714 --> 01:04:03,594
我不像pussywhipped哥哥 -

1101
01:04:03,844 --> 01:04:08,974
- who's too busy throwing his life away
for Emily. Beep.

1102
01:04:03,844 --> 01:04:08,974
- 谁也管不了扔寻欢
艾米丽。哔声。

1103
01:04:09,016 --> 01:04:14,146
Doug? Sorry I missed you.
I guess I'm getting married -

1104
01:04:09,054 --> 01:04:14,144
道格？对不起，我错过了你。
我想我要结婚了 -

1105
01:04:14,271 --> 01:04:19,401
- and I'm just wondering
if you wanted to be my best man.

1106
01:04:14,274 --> 01:04:19,394
- 我只是想知道
如果你想成为我的伴郎。

1107
01:04:20,524 --> 01:04:22,404
给我打电话或页面我。

1108
01:04:20,527 --> 01:04:22,404
Give me a call or page me.

1109
01:04:22,613 --> 01:04:27,743
I'm in our room still
across from the pool.

1110
01:04:22,614 --> 01:04:27,744
我在我们的房间还
对面的游泳池。

1111
01:04:27,824 --> 01:04:32,914
见到你。

1112
01:04:27,826 --> 01:04:32,915
See you.

1113
01:04:37,211 --> 01:04:42,299
- Let's go over this one more time.
- I know my duties as best man.

1114
01:04:37,214 --> 01:04:42,334
- 让我们来过这一次。
- 我知道我的职责伴郎。

1115
01:04:42,382 --> 01:04:47,471
I walk down the aisle.
I stand next to you.

1116
01:04:42,424 --> 01:04:47,514
我走在过道。
我就站在你旁边。

1117
01:04:47,596 --> 01:04:51,475
- I settle interwedding skirmishes.
- No, no...

1118
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:51,554
- 我解决interwedding小规模冲突。
- 不，不......

1119
01:04:51,725 --> 01:04:56,939
You're the best man. Not the wedding
bouncer. You just back me up.

1120
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:56,934
你是最好的男人。没有婚礼
保镖。你只是我的支援。

1121
01:04:58,064 --> 01:05:03,194
一样，如果事情变得太沉重，
我踩在像去污剂。

1122
01:04:58,065 --> 01:05:03,195
Like, if things get too heavy,
I step in like a spotter.

1123
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:06,154
- 是的，没错。
- 谢谢，伙计。

1124
01:05:03,278 --> 01:05:06,156
- Yeah, right.
- Thanks, man.

1125
01:05:06,404 --> 01:05:11,534
让我们去。我们准备好了，我们走吧。

1126
01:05:06,406 --> 01:05:11,537
Let's go. We're ready, let's go.

1127
01:05:12,663 --> 01:05:17,793
Do you want your kid blessed or not?

1128
01:05:12,664 --> 01:05:17,794
你想你的孩子祝福或没有？

1129
01:05:18,914 --> 01:05:24,044
- 理查德GRIECO。你知道史蒂夫？
- 我只是不想被起诉。

1130
01:05:18,919 --> 01:05:24,049
- Richard Grieco. You know Steve?
- I just don't want to be sued.

1131
01:05:25,133 --> 01:05:30,264
No, listen to me. You can't get your
kid confirmed for less than $150.

1132
01:05:25,174 --> 01:05:30,304
不，听我说。你不能让你的
孩子确诊为低于1美元50。

1133
01:05:30,347 --> 01:05:34,226
You want your kid blessed,
you call me.

1134
01:05:30,384 --> 01:05:34,304
您希望您的孩子有福了，
你给我打电话。

1135
01:05:34,476 --> 01:05:39,606
Dad, I didn't have a bachelor party.
That's a major part of a wedding.

1136
01:05:34,554 --> 01:05:39,644
爸爸，我没有一个单身派对。
这是一个婚礼的重要组成部分。

1137
01:05:41,854 --> 01:05:46,984
因此，我们可以延迟几个小时
这样我们就可以去一家脱衣舞俱乐部？

1138
01:05:41,859 --> 01:05:46,989
So could we delay a couple of hours
so that we could go to a strip club?

1139
01:05:47,072 --> 01:05:52,161
I have to go. Leave me a message.

1140
01:05:47,074 --> 01:05:52,154
我得走了。给我留言。

1141
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:57,244
哎...史蒂夫结婚。
你是男人！

1142
01:05:53,328 --> 01:05:57,249
Hey... Steve getting married.
You're the man!

1143
01:05:57,494 --> 01:06:02,584
闭嘴，克雷格。我走
在过道，你家伙！

1144
01:05:57,499 --> 01:06:02,588
Shut up, Craig. I'm walking
down the aisle, you dick!

1145
01:06:03,754 --> 01:06:08,844
我告诉你穿白色的。
奶奶的，下车的手机。

1146
01:06:03,755 --> 01:06:08,844
I told you to wear white.
Grandma, get off the phone.

1147
01:06:23,525 --> 01:06:26,403
Dearly beloved. We're gathered
here today to join...

1148
01:06:23,564 --> 01:06:26,444
亲爱的。我们正在收集
今天在这里参加...

1149
01:06:26,653 --> 01:06:31,742
Did we already start? Oh.

1150
01:06:26,694 --> 01:06:31,784
我们是否已经开始？呵呵。

1151
01:06:31,904 --> 01:06:37,034
我觉得有所谓
是一个蜂鸣器或口哨什么的。

1152
01:06:31,909 --> 01:06:37,039
I thought there was supposed
to be a buzzer or a whistle or something.

1153
01:06:38,164 --> 01:06:41,044
......这个人倾其
和这位女士的神圣的婚姻殿堂。

1154
01:06:38,165 --> 01:06:41,043
... to join together this man
and this woman in holy matrimony.

1155
01:06:41,293 --> 01:06:46,381
But first I understand the bride and
groom have each prepared something.

1156
01:06:41,294 --> 01:06:46,374
但首先，我明白了新娘和
新郎各有准备的东西。

1157
01:06:49,634 --> 01:06:54,724
“亲爱的史蒂夫。他们说，如果你设置
免费的东西，它回来 -

1158
01:06:49,635 --> 01:06:54,765
"Dear Steve. They say if you set
something free and it comes back -

1159
01:06:55,891 --> 01:06:59,812
- you should love it forever.
Like one of your silk plants, -

1160
01:06:55,894 --> 01:06:59,814
- 你应该爱它，直到永远。
像你们的丝绸厂之一， -

1161
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:05,108
- I'll try to stay beautiful. I know
our lives together will be great."

1162
01:07:00,064 --> 01:07:05,144
- 我会尽力保持美丽。我知道
我们生活在一起将是巨大的。“

1163
01:07:05,234 --> 01:07:09,154
"Just like when we saw David
Copperfield on our first date."

1164
01:07:05,274 --> 01:07:09,194
当我们看到大卫“一样，
科波菲尔在我们的第一次约会。“

1165
01:07:09,404 --> 01:07:14,535
"Love Emily."

1166
01:07:09,444 --> 01:07:14,574
“爱蜜莉。”

1167
01:07:20,914 --> 01:07:24,834
“我曾经看到外面你
我父亲的商店 -

1168
01:07:20,916 --> 01:07:24,795
"I used to see you outside
my father's store -

1169
01:07:25,084 --> 01:07:30,174
- 然后我们去上一些日期
你让我和你做爱。“

1170
01:07:25,087 --> 01:07:30,175
- and then we went on some dates
and you let me have sex with you."

1171
01:07:38,642 --> 01:07:41,520
Oh, I'm done.

1172
01:07:38,644 --> 01:07:41,524
哦，我完成了。

1173
01:07:41,728 --> 01:07:46,817
If anyone has reason to believe
that this man or woman -

1174
01:07:41,774 --> 01:07:46,854
如果任何人有理由相信
这个男人还是女人 -

1175
01:07:46,942 --> 01:07:52,072
- should not be married, speak now
or forever hold your peace.

1176
01:07:46,984 --> 01:07:52,114
- 不应该结婚的，现在说话
或永远握住你的平安。

1177
01:07:52,156 --> 01:07:57,244
- What's up? From out of town?
- Don't hit on the bridesmaid.

1178
01:07:52,194 --> 01:07:57,284
- 这是怎么回事？从外地来的？
- 不要打的伴娘。

1179
01:07:58,412 --> 01:08:03,500
- It's your wedding.
- Wait till after the ceremony.

1180
01:07:58,454 --> 01:08:03,534
- 这是你结婚。
- 等到仪式结束后。

1181
01:08:05,752 --> 01:08:10,883
Do you promise to love Emily for
as long as you both shall live?

1182
01:08:05,754 --> 01:08:10,884
你承诺的爱艾米莉的
只要你们两个人就要活了？

1183
01:08:10,964 --> 01:08:16,054
我爸爸已经支付的餐饮服务商。

1184
01:08:10,966 --> 01:08:16,054
My dad already paid the caterer.

1185
01:08:17,224 --> 01:08:22,304
你承诺的爱史蒂芬的
只要你们两个人就要活了？

1186
01:08:17,264 --> 01:08:22,311
Do you promise to love Steven for
as long as you both shall live?

1187
01:08:22,434 --> 01:08:27,564
- 以后我史蒂芬，重复。
- 在我之后。

1188
01:08:22,478 --> 01:08:27,524
- Steven, repeat after me.
- After me.

1189
01:08:32,821 --> 01:08:37,951
- With this ring, I thee wed.
- With this ring, I thee wed.

1190
01:08:32,864 --> 01:08:37,994
- 有了这个戒指，我娶你。
- 有了这个戒指，我娶你。

1191
01:08:41,163 --> 01:08:44,041
Now, Emily.

1192
01:08:41,204 --> 01:08:44,084
现在，艾米丽。

1193
01:08:44,291 --> 01:08:49,379
With this ring...

1194
01:08:44,334 --> 01:08:49,414
有了这个戒指...

1195
01:08:55,802 --> 01:09:00,974
Doug!

1196
01:08:55,804 --> 01:09:00,934
道格！

1197
01:09:03,104 --> 01:09:07,024
- 什么是地狱的，他来这里干什么？
- 让他停下来。

1198
01:09:03,143 --> 01:09:07,064
- What the hell's he doing here?
- Make him stop.

1199
01:09:07,274 --> 01:09:10,154
打开音乐关闭！

1200
01:09:07,314 --> 01:09:10,150
Turn that music off!

1201
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:15,489
You know
what I paid for this wedding?

1202
01:09:10,404 --> 01:09:15,524
你知道吗
我为此付出了婚礼？

1203
01:09:15,572 --> 01:09:20,661
Don't do that with your head.
That's so dumb!

1204
01:09:15,614 --> 01:09:20,704
不这样做，你的脑袋。
这是如此愚蠢！

1205
01:09:20,786 --> 01:09:24,706
- Mr. Butabi, I can't...
- Keep going. You want to get paid?

1206
01:09:20,824 --> 01:09:24,744
- Butabi先生，我不能...
- 继续下去。你要得到报酬？

1207
01:09:24,957 --> 01:09:30,087
- You're out of my will!
- I told you he was a jerk!

1208
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:30,124
- 你离开我的意志！
- 我告诉你他是个混蛋！

1209
01:09:42,724 --> 01:09:47,814
艾米莉...对不起。我还没想好。

1210
01:09:42,766 --> 01:09:47,855
Emily... Sorry. I'm not ready yet.

1211
01:09:47,934 --> 01:09:53,064
- 史蒂夫，停！
- 尼斯诗，虽然。对不起，爸爸。

1212
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:53,068
- Steve, stop!
- Nice poem, though. Sorry, Dad.

1213
01:09:53,152 --> 01:09:58,240
Steve, come back here!
Don't you leave me. I'm not kidding.

1214
01:09:53,154 --> 01:09:58,234
史蒂夫，回来这里！
不要你离开我。我不是在开玩笑。

1215
01:09:59,366 --> 01:10:04,454
Mr. Butabi, as an actor and observer
of human nature, I can tell you -

1216
01:09:59,404 --> 01:10:04,494
Butabi先生，作为一个演员和观察员
人性的，我可以告诉你 -

1217
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:09,710
- that your son is not ready
for this sort of commitment.

1218
01:10:04,624 --> 01:10:09,744
- 你的儿子还没有准备好
对于这种承诺。

1219
01:10:12,921 --> 01:10:18,051
- Hello.
- Hey.

1220
01:10:12,964 --> 01:10:18,094
- 你好。
- 嘿。

1221
01:10:23,394 --> 01:10:27,314
- 来吧，爸爸。
- 你在做什么？

1222
01:10:23,432 --> 01:10:27,311
- Go ahead, Father.
- What are you doing?

1223
01:10:27,564 --> 01:10:32,684
艾米丽，史蒂夫的纪律缺乏
这是他对你表示感谢。

1224
01:10:27,603 --> 01:10:32,733
Emily, Steve's discipline is lacking
as is his appreciation for you.

1225
01:10:33,814 --> 01:10:38,944
现在，我可以卧推305磅，
和自己的身体脂肪是小于2％。

1226
01:10:33,859 --> 01:10:38,947
Now, I can bench press 305 pound,
and my body fat is less than 2%.

1227
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:48,248
I am a professional trainer. I also
hope to market my own protein bar.

1228
01:10:43,204 --> 01:10:48,284
我是一名专业培训师。我也
希望向市场推出自己的蛋白质吧。

1229
01:10:48,373 --> 01:10:53,504
Plus, I've always loved you.

1230
01:10:48,414 --> 01:10:53,544
另外，我一直都爱着你。

1231
01:10:55,672 --> 01:10:59,593
Okay. But we should
look into infomercials.

1232
01:10:55,714 --> 01:10:59,634
好吧。但是，我们应该
直视电视购物节目。

1233
01:10:59,843 --> 01:11:04,973
- This is a completely new fee. Cool?
- Yeah.

1234
01:10:59,884 --> 01:11:04,974
- 这是一个完全新的费用。酷？
- 是啊。

1235
01:11:07,184 --> 01:11:12,314
好吧。亲爱的，
我们今天在这里聚集了......

1236
01:11:07,184 --> 01:11:12,356
Okay. Dearly beloved,
we're gathered here again today...

1237
01:11:14,484 --> 01:11:19,564
另外，我把克雷格泡吧。

1238
01:11:14,525 --> 01:11:19,571
Also, I took Craig clubbing.

1239
01:11:19,694 --> 01:11:22,574
这是所有权利。

1240
01:11:19,696 --> 01:11:22,533
That was all right.

1241
01:11:22,824 --> 01:11:27,914
另外，我租了很多视频。
我没有做什么其他东西。

1242
01:11:22,825 --> 01:11:27,913
Plus I rented a lot of videos.
I didn't do much else.

1243
01:11:32,167 --> 01:11:37,297
Look, Steve...

1244
01:11:32,204 --> 01:11:37,334
瞧，史蒂夫...

1245
01:11:38,423 --> 01:11:43,554
I'm sorry.
I said a lot of bad things before.

1246
01:11:38,464 --> 01:11:43,594
对不起。
我说了很多不好的事情之前。

1247
01:11:45,722 --> 01:11:50,853
I've been thinking...
You're my brother.

1248
01:11:45,764 --> 01:11:50,854
我一直在想...
你是我的兄弟。

1249
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:57,109
We're brothers,
and when we're together...

1250
01:11:52,024 --> 01:11:57,104
我们是兄弟，
而当我们在一起...

1251
01:11:59,314 --> 01:12:04,444
我只是...

1252
01:11:59,361 --> 01:12:04,449
I just...

1253
01:12:04,533 --> 01:12:08,412
You don't drag me down.

1254
01:12:04,534 --> 01:12:08,454
你不要拖我失望。

1255
01:12:08,704 --> 01:12:13,784
我拖我失望。

1256
01:12:08,704 --> 01:12:13,792
I drag me down.

1257
01:12:14,918 --> 01:12:17,838
And you...

1258
01:12:14,964 --> 01:12:17,834
而你...

1259
01:12:18,046 --> 01:12:20,966
You complete me.

1260
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:20,964
你完成了我。

1261
01:12:21,175 --> 01:12:25,095
- Shut up.
- What?

1262
01:12:21,214 --> 01:12:25,134
- 闭嘴。
- 什么？

1263
01:12:25,345 --> 01:12:30,476
Just shut up.
You had me at "hello".

1264
01:12:25,384 --> 01:12:30,474
闭上你的嘴。
你让我在“你好”。

1265
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:50,324
LT在我看来，你是一个有点困难
道格上比你在史蒂夫。

1266
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:50,329
lt seems to me, you're a bit harder
on Doug than you are on Steve.

1267
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:58,670
It's true. It's just that Doug is
so rebellious. I can't control him.

1268
01:12:53,544 --> 01:12:58,664
这是真的。这只是道格是
这样叛逆。我无法控制他。

1269
01:12:59,755 --> 01:13:01,673
But rebellious, scrappy, dreamer...

1270
01:12:59,794 --> 01:13:01,674
但叛逆，斗志旺盛，梦想家...

1271
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:06,970
What other young man
does that remind you of?

1272
01:13:01,884 --> 01:13:07,004
还有什么其他的年轻人
这是否提醒你？

1273
01:13:08,096 --> 01:13:13,227
- MyseIf as a kid.
- So who are you really fighting with?

1274
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:13,264
- MyseIf作为一个孩子。
- 那么，谁是你真正的战斗？

1275
01:13:15,434 --> 01:13:20,524
GRIECO先生...
你看穿我。

1276
01:13:15,437 --> 01:13:20,526
Mr. Grieco...
You see right through me.

1277
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:39,164
我错过了这辆车。
我看好它。

1278
01:13:35,249 --> 01:13:39,127
I missed this car.
I look good in it.

1279
01:13:39,414 --> 01:13:41,294
你看看也不错。

1280
01:13:39,419 --> 01:13:41,255
And you look good also.

1281
01:13:41,463 --> 01:13:46,593
Thanks.
Glad you moved back into the room.

1282
01:13:41,504 --> 01:13:46,634
谢谢。
很高兴你搬回了房间。

1283
01:13:46,677 --> 01:13:50,639
Dad was cool about the wedding
after his chat with Grieco.

1284
01:13:46,714 --> 01:13:50,634
爸爸是凉爽关于婚礼
之后他聊天GRIECO。

1285
01:13:50,848 --> 01:13:55,978
And it really improved
your relationship with him.

1286
01:13:50,884 --> 01:13:55,974
它真的改善
你跟他的关系。

1287
01:14:00,274 --> 01:14:04,194
- ls that an outside nightclub?
- That's your idea.

1288
01:14:00,274 --> 01:14:04,194
- LS的外部夜总会？
- 那是你的想法。

1289
01:14:04,444 --> 01:14:09,574
拉了过来。让我们来一探究竟。

1290
01:14:04,444 --> 01:14:09,575
Pull over. Let's check it out.

1291
01:14:14,830 --> 01:14:19,960
- We only let people in on the list.
- We're on the list.

1292
01:14:14,874 --> 01:14:19,994
- 我们只让人们在名单上。
- 我们的名单上。

1293
01:14:20,043 --> 01:14:25,132
- Steve and Doug Butabi.
- Step right in.

1294
01:14:20,084 --> 01:14:25,174
- 史蒂夫和道格Butabi。
- 步骤正确英寸

1295
01:14:27,342 --> 01:14:32,473
- Go right in.
- I guess we should go in then.

1296
01:14:27,384 --> 01:14:32,514
- 向右走英寸
- 我想我们应该去的呢。

1297
01:14:35,726 --> 01:14:40,856
- We're gonna go in.
- We're going in.

1298
01:14:41,982 --> 01:14:47,112
I can't believe we got in.
Sure it wasn't a mistake?

1299
01:14:41,984 --> 01:14:47,104
我不能相信我们上了车。
肯定这是不是一个错误？

1300
01:14:47,194 --> 01:14:52,284
- 这是奇怪的是在这里。
- 但是，他们偷了你的想法。

1301
01:14:47,196 --> 01:14:52,284
- It's weird to be in here.
- But they stole your idea.

1302
01:14:57,581 --> 01:15:02,669
Butabis? I've been looking
all over for you. Come here!

1303
01:15:02,794 --> 01:15:06,715
- Mr. Zadir!
- How do you like our club?

1304
01:15:06,965 --> 01:15:10,886
- Our club?
- I cut you in. lt was your idea.

1305
01:15:11,174 --> 01:15:16,304
- 甜蜜的屁股甜蜜。
- 跑步俱乐部是艰苦的工作。

1306
01:15:11,178 --> 01:15:16,266
- Sweet ass sweet.
- Running a club is hard work.

1307
01:15:16,391 --> 01:15:19,269
- Don't worry about it.
- We're workaholics.

1308
01:15:16,394 --> 01:15:19,264
- 不要担心。
- 我们是工作狂。

1309
01:15:19,478 --> 01:15:24,650
Dooey just called from Pismo Beach.
He says he didn't grab your ass.

1310
01:15:19,514 --> 01:15:24,644
Dooey从庇斯摩海滩刚刚打电话。
他说，他并没有抢你的屁股。

1311
01:15:24,733 --> 01:15:26,610
What is he up to now?

1312
01:15:24,734 --> 01:15:26,614
什么是他到现在？

1313
01:15:26,814 --> 01:15:31,904
- 噢，我的上帝！
- 噢，我的上帝！

1314
01:15:26,819 --> 01:15:31,907
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

1315
01:15:32,032 --> 01:15:37,162
- Let's do some business.
- All right.

1316
01:15:32,034 --> 01:15:37,154
- 让我们做一些生意。
- 好吧。

1317
01:15:39,289 --> 01:15:43,210
- Put some cherries on that.
- Nice call.

1318
01:15:39,334 --> 01:15:43,254
- 放在一些樱桃。
- 尼斯电话。

1319
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:48,549
- Mr. Butabi, can you approve this?
- That looks fine and all that.

1320
01:15:43,504 --> 01:15:48,584
- Butabi先生，你能同意吗？
- 这看起来很好，这一切。

1321
01:15:49,716 --> 01:15:52,594
- Hi, Mr. Barntabi.
- It's Butabi, but that's okay.

1322
01:15:52,845 --> 01:15:57,975
How's the hair?
Successful-club-owner good?

1323
01:15:58,058 --> 01:16:03,188
That voice sounds so familiar.

1324
01:15:58,094 --> 01:16:03,184
这声音听起来很熟悉。

1325
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:09,314
- 你是...？
- 道格？

1326
01:16:05,399 --> 01:16:09,319
- Are you..?
- Doug?

1327
01:16:09,564 --> 01:16:14,694
- 信用狐狸精？
- 我的上帝，我不能相信这一点。

1328
01:16:09,570 --> 01:16:14,700
- Credit vixen?
- My God, I can't believe this.

1329
01:16:14,783 --> 01:16:17,661
You're even more beautiful
than you sound.

1330
01:16:14,784 --> 01:16:17,664
你更美丽
比你的声音。

1331
01:16:17,911 --> 01:16:23,000
- You stopped calling.
- Not because I didn't want to.

1332
01:16:17,914 --> 01:16:23,034
- 你不再打电话。
- 不是因为我不想。

1333
01:16:24,126 --> 01:16:29,256
Am I what you expected?

1334
01:16:24,164 --> 01:16:29,294
我是什么令您满意？

1335
01:16:29,339 --> 01:16:33,260
I totally approve.

1336
01:16:29,384 --> 01:16:33,304
我完全赞同。

1337
01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:38,599
- You're not here with anyone?
- Just my friend.

1338
01:16:33,554 --> 01:16:38,634
- 你不是这里的人？
- 只是我的朋友。

1339
01:16:40,851 --> 01:16:42,728
Hottie police officer?

1340
01:16:40,854 --> 01:16:42,724
辣妹警官吗？

1341
01:16:42,934 --> 01:16:48,064
我真的很期待
至6月6日与您会面在法庭上。

1342
01:16:42,936 --> 01:16:48,066
I was really looking forward
to meeting you in court on June 6th.

1343
01:16:49,193 --> 01:16:54,323
- So, do you guys wanna dance?
- No.

1344
01:16:49,194 --> 01:16:54,324
- 那么，你们想跳舞吗？
- 号

1345
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:59,364
- 是的。
- 是的。

1346
01:16:55,449 --> 01:16:59,369
- Yes.
- Yes.

1347
01:16:59,614 --> 01:17:04,744
- 哦，我喜欢这首歌。
- 我得到的是种病态。

1348
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:04,750
- Oh, I love this song.
- I'm getting kind of sick of it.

1349
01:17:48,627 --> 01:17:53,674
I broke the window again.
