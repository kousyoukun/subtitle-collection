1
00:01:09,097 --> 00:01:12,851
- Hi.
- Who, me? Him?

2
00:01:13,059 --> 00:01:17,939
- Not you.
- Don't worry about it.

3
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:29,950
Hey!

4
00:01:52,095 --> 00:01:56,975
- How are you doing?
- Oh, fuck off.

5
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,855
- What's up?
- Feel good. All right.

6
00:02:03,064 --> 00:02:07,943
Excuse me.

7
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:14,991
- Yeah. Score.
- Very nice.

8
00:02:23,124 --> 00:02:27,961
All right. Let's talk
to this little lady called Night.

9
00:02:38,054 --> 00:02:40,848
I broke the window again.

10
00:02:41,057 --> 00:02:44,852
- Dad's gonna be pissed.
- I'll just tell him you did it.

11
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,940
But I didn't do it.
I'm driving. Don't do that.

12
00:02:56,112 --> 00:02:59,866
So anyways, I'm standing there,
waiting to use the pay phone ...

13
00:03:00,116 --> 00:03:05,037
And this guy on the phone turns
around and tips his hat like this.

14
00:03:06,121 --> 00:03:09,833
And who do you think that guy was?

15
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:15,004
- Emilio Estevez.
- 'The Mighty Duck'. I was there!

16
00:03:15,088 --> 00:03:19,967
Of course you were. You yelled
the "Breakfast Clubber's" name.

17
00:03:24,054 --> 00:03:28,976
So, anyway.
You guys wanna make out or what?

18
00:04:01,088 --> 00:04:04,842
Oh, man. lt was perfect that time.

19
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:09,930
Four months of work for nothing.

20
00:04:11,056 --> 00:04:14,809
- What's up?
- Did you know you were doing 50?

21
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,981
Hottie cop likes you. Think she pulls
over just anybody? Make a move.

22
00:04:24,109 --> 00:04:27,863
- What's up?
- Just giving you an $80 ticket.

23
00:04:28,113 --> 00:04:32,993
She is so into you.

24
00:04:35,078 --> 00:04:39,957
- I want you to do me a favor.
- Whatever you say, 'T.J. Hooker".

25
00:04:43,085 --> 00:04:47,965
Please obey all posted speed limits.
Have a good night.

26
00:04:48,048 --> 00:04:52,969
It's already been good, now
that you've served and protected me.

27
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:11,028
- What was the point of that?
- Sorry.

28
00:05:17,075 --> 00:05:21,954
Come next week. I'm gonna
take care of you. All right, man.

29
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:24,832
This is the Roxbury. We have a list.

30
00:05:25,082 --> 00:05:28,835
- We're on the list. Doug Butabi.
- Steve Butabi.

31
00:05:29,086 --> 00:05:31,838
- You're brothers?
- No.

32
00:05:32,047 --> 00:05:37,010
- Yes. Man!
- That's quite a joke.

33
00:05:37,093 --> 00:05:39,846
- Doug is hilarious.
- Check this out.

34
00:05:40,096 --> 00:05:45,017
You ever heard of this one?
You're not on the list. Get in line.

35
00:05:50,105 --> 00:05:54,984
- ls that ..?
- It's the king of "21 Jump Street".

36
00:05:55,068 --> 00:05:59,947
Richard Grieco.

37
00:06:02,074 --> 00:06:05,828
- Excuse me.
- See you later. We'll go wait in line.

38
00:06:06,078 --> 00:06:08,830
- Maybe we'll hang out later?
- No chance.

39
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:13,960
- Sounds good.
- Know what's wrong with this place?

40
00:06:15,086 --> 00:06:19,924
- They don't evaluate the clientele.
- I thought we just weren't cool enough.

41
00:06:21,092 --> 00:06:25,971
You are a beautiful man. Know what
we're gonna do when we get our club?

42
00:06:27,097 --> 00:06:31,977
We're gonna treat all wannabes just
as well as any legendary tv-star.

43
00:06:33,103 --> 00:06:37,941
- That's pretty Roosevelt of you.
- It's just what I believe in.

44
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:43,821
- Wanna dance?
- We're not in the club yet.

45
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:47,825
So, maybe when we get in?

46
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:53,038
So I'm waiting to use the pay phone,
and this guy tips his hat like this.

47
00:06:56,082 --> 00:07:01,003
- And who do you think that guy was?
- Emilio Estevez!

48
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:05,966
'The Mighty Duck', man. I swear
to God. I was, like, "Emilio!"

49
00:07:08,093 --> 00:07:13,014
"Emilio .. !"

50
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:17,935
The club is closed, folks. Sorry.

51
00:07:44,084 --> 00:07:49,006
- Nozzled you, my friend.
- Totally got me.

52
00:07:49,089 --> 00:07:53,969
That was in my nose.

53
00:07:56,095 --> 00:08:00,975
- You're an idiot.
- Oh yeah? You like it.

54
00:08:02,059 --> 00:08:06,980
Get off ... Watch it!

55
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:15,029
Where's Mom? And who's this
gorgeous young hottie in the kitchen?

56
00:08:15,071 --> 00:08:19,992
- Why is she wearing Mom's bathrobe?
- What do you think of my new chin?

57
00:08:21,118 --> 00:08:23,871
ls it better than last year's?

58
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:29,001
Behave yourselves. Look who's
gracing us with their presence.

59
00:08:30,085 --> 00:08:31,920
- Who?
- Here, Dad.

60
00:08:32,087 --> 00:08:37,008
It's a health shake.
lt helps me hit my physical peak.

61
00:08:37,091 --> 00:08:40,803
Get the camera.
He's gonna hit his peak.

62
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:45,933
- Honey, do it in your room.
- Oh, Mom, you're so funny.

63
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:50,979
Steve? In the store in a haIf hour.
Wear something nice. Emily's back.

64
00:08:52,063 --> 00:08:55,817
As if he gives a flying rat's ass.

65
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:58,861
"Flying rat's ass ..."
That would be wild to see.

66
00:08:59,112 --> 00:09:03,991
Steve, at the store in a haIf hour.
Bring your dancing monkey brother.

67
00:10:01,085 --> 00:10:05,923
Hey, are you from out of town?
You have a local number?

68
00:10:11,053 --> 00:10:15,932
Are you all right? Sure?

69
00:10:25,107 --> 00:10:29,987
Finally. An hour and a haIf late.
Steve, go dust the roses.

70
00:10:32,113 --> 00:10:35,867
ldiot boy,
go cover the cash register.

71
00:10:36,075 --> 00:10:40,997
ldiot boy,
go cover the cash register.

72
00:10:46,043 --> 00:10:50,964
Hi. How are you paying for these?
Cash, check or charge?

73
00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:54,884
- Charge.
- Okay.

74
00:10:55,093 --> 00:10:59,972
- ls this a Visa or a Mastercard?
- Move your thumb.

75
00:11:00,097 --> 00:11:03,851
Good one. Okay.

76
00:11:04,101 --> 00:11:09,022
Sure this is your card? It's not
processing. I have to call it in.

77
00:11:20,074 --> 00:11:23,869
- Operator 238, please.
- Authorisation. Card number?

78
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:27,831
- What's up?
- I told you not to call anymore.

79
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,835
- I need an approval.
- Card number?

80
00:11:32,085 --> 00:11:36,965
- Not the card, sweetness, me.
- Shut up and swipe it.

81
00:11:38,091 --> 00:11:41,844
I can go for that.

82
00:11:42,094 --> 00:11:47,015
You like that? Does that feel good?
'Cause I can swipe it all night.

83
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:53,021
- The card's fine. Bye, Doug.
- Bye, 238.

84
00:11:56,107 --> 00:11:58,860
Hi. Can I help you?

85
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:03,989
Hi, Doug. Your nightclub's so cool.
Can my model friends come in?

86
00:12:04,073 --> 00:12:07,868
- No. Yes.
- You're so funny and cute and tall.

87
00:12:08,076 --> 00:12:09,870
Let's shake it.

88
00:12:10,037 --> 00:12:14,999
What are you doing? You have to cut up
my plants and make toys of them?

89
00:12:16,084 --> 00:12:19,837
- It's a club with a jungle theme.
- You're a jungle theme.

90
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:25,009
Go find your brother and load
the trucks. ldiot ... Useless!

91
00:12:35,101 --> 00:12:38,855
- Steve ..?
- Don't look.

92
00:12:39,105 --> 00:12:43,984
- Hi, Steve. Hey, Doug.
- Whatever.

93
00:12:54,077 --> 00:12:56,829
Now I'm back,
so we can get together.

94
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,833
- You wanna go see a movie?
- Sure.

95
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:05,963
Or we could just drive around
and make out. I love making out.

96
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:13,011
- And I'm really good at it.
- Sounds good.

97
00:13:13,094 --> 00:13:17,974
Back off, Chicklett. My brother and
I, we live life in the fast lane.

98
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,853
That means no stop signs,
no pulling over to take pictures.

99
00:13:23,104 --> 00:13:27,983
See this man? He's my co-pilot
on this magic carpet ride.

100
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:32,946
- You're just way too much luggage.
- Shut up, Doug.

101
00:13:34,072 --> 00:13:38,993
Emily?
I see you've picked the right son.

102
00:13:40,077 --> 00:13:43,831
You know, Steve likes you very much.

103
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:49,002
Mr. Butabi. ls Steve asking Emily
to marry him again?

104
00:13:50,087 --> 00:13:53,840
You know something?
If they have enough children, -

105
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,843
- we won't have to hire salesmen.

106
00:13:57,093 --> 00:14:01,973
- Oh, Kamehl, you kill me.
- No, you kill me, Mr. Sanderson.

107
00:14:03,099 --> 00:14:07,978
- Can you please leave Steve alone?
- He likes the girl ... Yes, you do!

108
00:14:10,147 --> 00:14:14,984
You see this wall? After they
get married, we'll combine stores -

109
00:14:15,068 --> 00:14:18,863
- and have the first plant-lamp
shop. Steve and Emily will run it.

110
00:14:19,072 --> 00:14:23,951
- Maybe you can clean the toilets.
- You're living on "Fantasy lsland".

111
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:30,832
- God, that was a sweet show.
- I have a fantasy.

112
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:35,962
That I have two capable sons.
Not one with his head up his ass!

113
00:14:36,087 --> 00:14:41,008
ls this how you load trucks?
Disgusting. Get out of here.

114
00:14:45,095 --> 00:14:48,849
- So we're on a break?
- I guess.

115
00:14:49,099 --> 00:14:54,020
- You wanna crunch it?
- Sure. Let's crunch.

116
00:14:58,066 --> 00:15:02,987
- Can the rest of us use the mirror?
- Appreciate it.

117
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:06,824
- Everyone's got an attitude here.
- Gentlemen! Looking large.

118
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:11,953
Want my power bar?
How about an energy bar?

119
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:17,000
- I got a muscle triplicator bar.
- Supplements aside ...

120
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:21,837
- How long have we been friends?
- All seven years of high school.

121
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:27,009
That's why I'm not gonna sugar coat
it. I'm worried about your triceps.

122
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:34,015
You aren't going all the way down.
I'm not seeing full extension.

123
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:39,020
We had a long talk about that
the other night.

124
00:15:39,062 --> 00:15:43,941
You just shouldn't cheat yourselves.
Sorry to come down on you like this.

125
00:15:46,068 --> 00:15:49,821
That's why we love you and hate you.

126
00:15:50,072 --> 00:15:52,824
- Still friends?
- You know it.

127
00:15:53,074 --> 00:15:57,954
I'm glad we had this talk.

128
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:14,844
I had a great idea for the store ...

129
00:16:15,095 --> 00:16:19,974
The store? You're supposed to be
thinking about ... Hey, what's up?

130
00:16:21,058 --> 00:16:25,980
- Can we call you sometime?
- Want some of this?

131
00:16:26,063 --> 00:16:29,858
- Think about our future.
- You're Mount St. Helensing on me.

132
00:16:30,067 --> 00:16:32,819
Why are you forgetting our plans?

133
00:16:33,069 --> 00:16:37,949
The plans about you and I opening up
only the coolest club a la the Roxbury.

134
00:16:38,074 --> 00:16:42,995
- How? We can't even get in.
- We're letting them not let us in.

135
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:49,001
But no more. It's time we step up
into that sweet-ass world.

136
00:16:50,085 --> 00:16:55,048
From now on, the only club
we're going to is the Roxbury.

137
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,884
- We can't ...
- We can. You know why?

138
00:16:58,134 --> 00:17:03,013
- We're good looking?
- Very good looking. You especially.

139
00:17:03,097 --> 00:17:07,976
Repeat after me:
We can get into the Roxbury.

140
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,855
We can get into the Roxbury.

141
00:17:12,063 --> 00:17:16,985
Roxbury .. !

142
00:17:21,072 --> 00:17:25,951
Hey, what's up? You want some
of this? How about a little of that?

143
00:17:27,077 --> 00:17:31,957
She starts to smell them.
She thought they were real plants!

144
00:17:35,126 --> 00:17:38,880
- Hello?
- What's up?

145
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:43,968
The Sandersons are here to see
your mother's new chin. Get dressed.

146
00:17:44,093 --> 00:17:49,014
- Sorry, we're a bit busy tonight.
- Steve? I'll be right back.

147
00:17:50,057 --> 00:17:54,978
I like your bathing suit. You have
really good muscle definition.

148
00:17:55,061 --> 00:17:59,941
Most Americans don't wear revealing
bathing suits. Very European of you.

149
00:18:00,066 --> 00:18:04,987
It's really sexy and I have
a really good taste in what's sexy.

150
00:18:06,071 --> 00:18:10,992
- Steve!
- Whatever, Emily.

151
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:26,882
Good.

152
00:18:27,091 --> 00:18:30,844
What's going on ..?

153
00:18:31,094 --> 00:18:35,974
Are you from out of town ..?

154
00:19:07,086 --> 00:19:11,965
When I tell you to do something,
I mean it. Never come in half-naked.

155
00:19:14,092 --> 00:19:18,971
- Put some clothes on and come down.
- lsn't on our things-to-do-list.

156
00:19:19,055 --> 00:19:23,934
- We have something to do tonight.
- Yes. To get downstairs.

157
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:27,813
I don't want to!

158
00:19:28,063 --> 00:19:31,858
How do I get through
to this individual?

159
00:19:32,108 --> 00:19:34,861
Doug is like a fax machine.

160
00:19:35,111 --> 00:19:39,991
Without a cover page, people don't
know where it's coming from.

161
00:19:41,117 --> 00:19:45,996
And sometimes you get a busy signal.
That's why you got a redial button.

162
00:19:46,121 --> 00:19:51,001
- Actually, I always screw it up ...
- Don't bother. He'll never understand.

163
00:19:51,084 --> 00:19:55,964
I understand very well. You're going
to a new, hot club tonight, right?

164
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:03,971
- But how are you gonna get there?
- What are you doing?

165
00:20:30,078 --> 00:20:33,832
You can take away our phones
and our keys, but not our dreams.

166
00:20:34,082 --> 00:20:39,003
'Cos we're, like, sleeping
when we have them.

167
00:20:39,087 --> 00:20:43,966
Later much!

168
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:48,971
Boys, wait. I don't like you leaving
without a phone.

169
00:20:50,055 --> 00:20:52,849
How old are these? How embarrassing.

170
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:57,937
You know, in case of emergency.
Have fun.

171
00:20:58,104 --> 00:21:03,025
- Did Mom get lipstick on me?
- lt looks like you were making out.

172
00:21:14,077 --> 00:21:18,998
- How's my hair? Roxbury-good?
- You know it.

173
00:21:19,082 --> 00:21:23,961
I've got to tell you, Steve,
tonight, I can taste it.

174
00:21:25,087 --> 00:21:29,967
I can't taste it. I'm so scared right now.
I don't know what to do.

175
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:35,013
- You're mad-cowing on me. Relax.
- I'm nervous.

176
00:21:35,096 --> 00:21:39,976
- It's this pressure to get in.
- You must take control of yourself.

177
00:21:41,102 --> 00:21:45,981
No, you take control.
I'm barely hanging on here.

178
00:21:47,107 --> 00:21:51,945
Come on, relax. Think puppies
and candy canes, all right?

179
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:56,991
- Hey, hotlegs. What's going on?
- We'll clean it up later. Don't worry.

180
00:22:00,077 --> 00:22:04,999
I see your Roxbury balloon
and I hate to burst it, -

181
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:11,004
- but I don't think
our names are on that list.

182
00:22:11,046 --> 00:22:12,923
Perfect. "Rites of Passage".

183
00:22:13,048 --> 00:22:17,969
Remember? A boy in the jungle
with only a spear to hunt the lion.

184
00:22:19,095 --> 00:22:22,848
This van is our spear.
That Roxbury is our lion.

185
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:26,852
- Does the bouncer know about this?
- He's about to find out.

186
00:22:27,102 --> 00:22:28,896
See you next week.

187
00:22:29,104 --> 00:22:33,942
- My good hombre. Remember us?
- Doug and Steve Butabi.

188
00:22:35,068 --> 00:22:38,821
- You're brothers?
- No ... Yes.

189
00:22:39,072 --> 00:22:41,824
- Man!
- Works every time.

190
00:22:42,074 --> 00:22:46,995
Now I remember. You can't come in.

191
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:51,958
What's up, partner?
How are you doing tonight?

192
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:55,879
Time to play a little softball.

193
00:22:56,087 --> 00:23:01,008
- Hey, good man. How's it going?
- Good. You stilI can't come in.

194
00:23:02,093 --> 00:23:07,014
That's not what my friend told me.
His name is Abraham.

195
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,853
- You don't know him?
- What about his two friends?

196
00:23:14,104 --> 00:23:18,983
George Washington
and George Washington?

197
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:25,948
And George Washington is a little
lonely. Wants to join his buddies.

198
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:32,996
And look who else we've got.
Roosevelt, Roosevelt and Jefferson.

199
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:41,962
Thanks ... Great.

200
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:47,009
- ls that an ATM?
- That's where we drop off videos.

201
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,845
- Hello, that's it.
- That was a card store.

202
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:55,016
- That's just Weight Watchers ...
- ATM. That's it.

203
00:24:02,064 --> 00:24:05,818
- Shit. The car.
- What about me?

204
00:24:06,068 --> 00:24:10,989
This racing car is illegal.
All I need is a police report.

205
00:24:12,115 --> 00:24:15,869
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, let me see.

206
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:21,040
Great. They're starting
with the neck injuries. I'm screwed.

207
00:24:23,084 --> 00:24:25,878
Jesus, man.

208
00:24:26,086 --> 00:24:31,007
- Sorry about your van.
- No way. Richard Grieco!

209
00:24:32,092 --> 00:24:37,013
- We saw you at the Roxbury.
- Right. So what do you want to do?

210
00:24:38,097 --> 00:24:42,977
- Go to the Roxbury again.
- We couldn't get in.

211
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:47,940
You want me to get you
into the Roxbury? Great. Follow me.

212
00:24:51,068 --> 00:24:53,862
- Amazing.
- lt all comes from within.

213
00:24:54,112 --> 00:24:57,865
He felt it because he's an actor.

214
00:24:58,116 --> 00:25:03,037
We gotta make a stop at the Roxbury.
I just don't want a lawsuit.

215
00:25:17,091 --> 00:25:21,929
Oh, my God, this is the most
amazing place I've ever been.

216
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:27,935
This is the coatroom.
The club's in there.

217
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:33,940
What's up ..?

218
00:25:35,108 --> 00:25:39,987
- Get a hold of yourself.
- It's hottie overload in here.

219
00:25:40,112 --> 00:25:45,034
- Just pace yourself.
- What's up? Two, three, four.

220
00:25:45,117 --> 00:25:49,997
What's up? Two, three, four ...

221
00:25:52,082 --> 00:25:54,876
- Sweet!
- Sweet!

222
00:25:55,085 --> 00:25:57,837
Richie, good to see you. Get over here.

223
00:25:58,087 --> 00:26:02,967
- The place is kicking.
- Jumping like "21 Jump Street".

224
00:26:04,051 --> 00:26:08,972
Who are your friends?

225
00:26:17,063 --> 00:26:19,857
- The owner.
- The man we want to be.

226
00:26:20,107 --> 00:26:25,029
- I thought we wanted to be Grieco.
- Professionally, it's this guy.

227
00:26:28,115 --> 00:26:33,036
Dooey, my main man. I love
this man. Meet the Butabi brothers.

228
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:39,000
These are good boys.
Did you grab my ass?

229
00:26:40,084 --> 00:26:42,837
- No, sir. I did not grab your ass.
- It's okay if you did.

230
00:26:43,087 --> 00:26:47,925
I understand. It's just that
you're barking up the wrong tree.

231
00:26:51,094 --> 00:26:53,847
- You guys come here a lot?
- All the time.

232
00:26:54,097 --> 00:26:57,850
- But we've never been inside.
- Watch what you're saying.

233
00:26:58,101 --> 00:27:03,022
So, is Johnny Depp meeting you here?

234
00:27:04,106 --> 00:27:07,860
No.

235
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:13,031
All right ... Listen, Bennie,
see you later. See you, guys.

236
00:27:14,074 --> 00:27:18,995
- See you, Richard Grieco.
- See you, Grieco's lady.

237
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:25,000
I'm honoured to shoot the shit with
the owner of the club of all clubs.

238
00:27:26,043 --> 00:27:30,964
- And we're proficient club hoppers.
- We usually go to the Mudd Club.

239
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:35,844
- That place is rank.
- They let any asswad in the door.

240
00:27:36,094 --> 00:27:39,847
- I own that place also.
- It's a really good location, though.

241
00:27:40,097 --> 00:27:45,019
No, you're right. One day
you're hot, the next day you're not.

242
00:27:49,106 --> 00:27:52,859
Actually, I had an idea for a club.

243
00:27:53,109 --> 00:27:56,863
- Wait. Did you grab my ass?
- No.

244
00:27:57,071 --> 00:28:01,993
- Do you want to?
- No. Should I?

245
00:28:04,078 --> 00:28:07,789
Okay. Continue.

246
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:12,961
People waiting outside are bummed,
'cos they're trying to get in.

247
00:28:14,045 --> 00:28:17,840
What if the outside of the club
looked like the inside?

248
00:28:18,091 --> 00:28:23,012
With couches and music and all that.
But then on the inside ...

249
00:28:24,096 --> 00:28:27,850
... it looks like the street.
You know, cars and signs.

250
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:33,021
The outside is the inside
and the inside is the outside.

251
00:28:33,104 --> 00:28:35,857
Doesn't that blow your mind?

252
00:28:36,107 --> 00:28:41,028
- What about that guy?
- Owns a restaurant. One.

253
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:45,949
- Boy, has this place gone downhill.
- No one over six figures. Let's go.

254
00:28:47,076 --> 00:28:50,829
- Wait. That's that Zadir guy.
- Who are those guys with him?

255
00:28:51,037 --> 00:28:55,959
If they're with Zadir,
they've got to be worth something.

256
00:28:56,084 --> 00:28:58,836
Great. Let's work.

257
00:28:59,087 --> 00:29:02,840
- Tell him about the vampire idea.
- That's a dumb idea.

258
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:05,843
I have to say hello to Jim Carrey.

259
00:29:06,093 --> 00:29:08,845
Come here,
you pet detective bastard.

260
00:29:09,096 --> 00:29:13,975
"Smoking", you crazy son of a bitch.

261
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:19,021
- Was I too pushy? Did I speak well?
- You were totally articulate.

262
00:29:19,105 --> 00:29:23,984
It's hard to pitch in a nightclub.
The music is way too loud in here.

263
00:29:24,068 --> 00:29:28,989
We have to get a meeting. Steve ..?

264
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:43,836
- You want to dance?
- Yes.

265
00:29:44,086 --> 00:29:47,840
- All right. Take it easy.
- She said yes.

266
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:53,011
Hotties wanna shake it. Come on.

267
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:59,961
That's some good ass-grabbing
going on there.

268
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:08,844
1 980. Good year.

269
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:12,889
Excellent year. Devo had a huge hit.

270
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:17,977
- And "Joanie Loves Chachi" started.
- Chachi gives a fuck about Joanie.

271
00:32:21,063 --> 00:32:25,943
Cambi makes a good point.
But tonight we have some fun.

272
00:32:26,068 --> 00:32:30,989
- Sweet suds, Mr. Zadir.
- But you know what makes a party?

273
00:32:31,072 --> 00:32:34,826
- Fluffy whip.
- But not putting it on stuff.

274
00:32:35,076 --> 00:32:39,956
You press the little white nozzle
and you suck on it. It's fun.

275
00:32:41,082 --> 00:32:45,961
- You mean, like, nitrous oxide?
- No. What is that?

276
00:32:47,087 --> 00:32:50,841
Dooey, we have to stop and get
some fluffy whip for the party.

277
00:32:51,091 --> 00:32:54,844
- Yes, sir.
- lt has to be in a can.

278
00:32:55,095 --> 00:32:56,930
He can't hear you.

279
00:32:57,138 --> 00:33:01,976
Hey, Dooey, tell your mom
I had a nice time last night.

280
00:33:02,059 --> 00:33:05,854
- And your dad.
- What?

281
00:33:06,063 --> 00:33:09,858
- I mean, your sister.
- Good one!

282
00:33:10,067 --> 00:33:13,820
- Only in a Limo.
- We nailed him.

283
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:18,991
Disco-dicks.

284
00:33:19,075 --> 00:33:23,954
- And that alien was Robin Williams.
- I'll be right back.

285
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:29,001
- It's my boss's card.
- I'll take care of that.

286
00:33:31,086 --> 00:33:36,007
- Operator 238, please.
- Hello, Doug.

287
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:41,012
- Guess where we went tonight.
- The One-Stop Market on Ventura?

288
00:33:43,097 --> 00:33:46,850
No, I mean before that,
you sly, little credit vixen.

289
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:51,938
I give up, you nasty card-swiper.

290
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:56,985
- The Roxbury. Come out some time.
- I would.

291
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:59,821
But then who would approve
all the money you spend?

292
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:04,992
- You're always thinking of me.
- The card's good. Bye, Doug.

293
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:13,958
She approved. Approved.

294
00:34:17,128 --> 00:34:21,966
- Sweet-ass dwelling, Mr. Zadir.
- It's a place to hang my hat.

295
00:34:33,059 --> 00:34:37,939
Look. A hundred thousand dollar
sound system, and nobody's dancing.

296
00:34:39,065 --> 00:34:43,944
If I may congest, the pool is taking
up the prime dancing real estate.

297
00:34:44,069 --> 00:34:48,991
If you put glass over the pool,
it would be like dancing on water.

298
00:34:51,118 --> 00:34:54,871
- And people love to do that.
- Let's not talk business now.

299
00:34:55,121 --> 00:34:57,874
Let's set up a meeting.

300
00:34:58,124 --> 00:35:03,045
Anna Nicole? Put something on.
You're making us sick.

301
00:35:03,087 --> 00:35:05,839
Meeting!

302
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:08,842
- Let's mingle.
- Right.

303
00:35:09,092 --> 00:35:13,972
This ltalian food tastes so good.
It's, like, Mexican.

304
00:35:14,055 --> 00:35:16,849
- Could you pass me a towel, please?
- Good. How are you?

305
00:35:17,058 --> 00:35:21,937
- They're right behind you.
- BMW ... Vanilla, mostly.

306
00:35:23,063 --> 00:35:25,816
- There you are.
- We got scared.

307
00:35:26,066 --> 00:35:29,820
- Of who? We'll kick his ass.
- No.

308
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:33,823
We got scared
somebody stole you away from us.

309
00:35:34,074 --> 00:35:36,868
Oh, okay.

310
00:35:37,118 --> 00:35:40,871
Like some other girls
would steal us away ...

311
00:35:41,122 --> 00:35:45,959
Oh, right. Oh!

312
00:35:48,086 --> 00:35:53,008
So, do you guys wanna go some place
we can be alone?

313
00:35:53,091 --> 00:35:56,844
No ... Yes! Oh, man.

314
00:35:57,053 --> 00:36:01,932
- Why does it taste so sweet?
- 'Cos it's like candy.

315
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:09,940
These are real.
They'll be dead in a week.

316
00:36:11,066 --> 00:36:15,987
You know what I always thought
would make a cool 'Twilight Zone"?

317
00:36:17,113 --> 00:36:19,866
Like, we see a picture
of this lady, -

318
00:36:20,116 --> 00:36:25,037
- but to this lady, are we just
a picture of us? Ever think of that?

319
00:36:26,121 --> 00:36:28,832
No.

320
00:36:29,082 --> 00:36:31,835
Why don't you come over here?

321
00:36:32,085 --> 00:36:37,006
Vivica, you know what I heard
when I first met you?

322
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:41,969
What?

323
00:36:46,056 --> 00:36:48,850
- What are you doing?
- That's an ambulance.

324
00:36:49,059 --> 00:36:53,938
Coming to take me away.
The sight of you stopped my heart.

325
00:36:55,064 --> 00:36:59,986
Cambi, do you like blueberries
or strawberries?

326
00:37:02,113 --> 00:37:07,034
I wanna know what kind of pancakes
to order you in the morning.

327
00:37:09,077 --> 00:37:13,957
Steve!

328
00:37:16,084 --> 00:37:19,837
- I was wondering ...
- What are you doing?

329
00:37:20,087 --> 00:37:25,009
Checking your label.
Just as I thought. Made in heaven.

330
00:37:26,051 --> 00:37:28,887
Doug. You've gotten past
the opening lines.

331
00:37:29,096 --> 00:37:33,933
- ls that a mirror in your pocket?
- What?

332
00:37:35,101 --> 00:37:38,855
I could see myseIf in your pants.

333
00:37:39,105 --> 00:37:43,984
If I said you had a nice body,
would you hold it against me?

334
00:37:48,113 --> 00:37:52,993
I was there. I was, like, "Emilio!"
And Doug was going cra ...

335
00:37:54,077 --> 00:37:58,998
And Steve was, like, "Emilio!"
Oh, God, if you were only there.

336
00:38:00,082 --> 00:38:05,004
I feel like a selfish pig, going on
about myself. What about you?

337
00:38:05,087 --> 00:38:08,840
Where are you from?
Any brothers or sisters? Any family?

338
00:38:09,049 --> 00:38:11,843
- Pets, what about pets?
- I got a cat.

339
00:38:12,052 --> 00:38:14,846
Really? A cat? lnteresting.

340
00:38:15,096 --> 00:38:19,976
I think of you more as a dog person.
Maybe a Pomeranian. Lhasa Apso.

341
00:38:20,101 --> 00:38:25,022
Something small, warm, fuzzy ...

342
00:38:26,106 --> 00:38:27,900
ls this your first time?

343
00:38:28,108 --> 00:38:32,988
Yes. lsn't it yours?

344
00:38:34,072 --> 00:38:36,824
- ls this your first time?
- What?

345
00:38:37,075 --> 00:38:41,954
Are you serious?
Oh, you're hilarious.

346
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:47,000
Oh, man. You're funny.
Hey, Steve? You're a funny girl.

347
00:38:50,087 --> 00:38:54,966
All right. Hey, where are you going?

348
00:38:59,095 --> 00:39:03,974
- Oh, my God.
- Did you just? 'Cos I just ...

349
00:39:10,105 --> 00:39:14,984
Not that it hasn't happened before.
lt was okay.

350
00:39:15,068 --> 00:39:19,947
I'm gonna go back in and ...

351
00:39:22,074 --> 00:39:26,995
- Hey, Steve?
- Yeah, Doug?

352
00:39:31,082 --> 00:39:35,962
- You got a number.
- We got a number.

353
00:39:44,094 --> 00:39:49,016
I got some great office supplies
for our new nightclub business.

354
00:39:49,099 --> 00:39:52,852
Post-lt notes to annotate important
documents.

355
00:39:53,103 --> 00:39:56,814
Little ones. You write smaller than
me. Mugs with our names on them.

356
00:39:57,065 --> 00:40:00,818
Yours say Doug.
Did you call Mr. Zadir?

357
00:40:01,068 --> 00:40:05,948
Before you talk to a man like Mr. Zadir,
you have to have a plan of attack.

358
00:40:07,074 --> 00:40:11,953
I'd like to schedule a meeting.
Can you do ... 1 2:30?

359
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:17,000
Let me see.

360
00:40:20,086 --> 00:40:21,921
- I'm clear.
- You know what?

361
00:40:22,088 --> 00:40:25,841
Let's have a pre-meeting
to brainstorm before our meeting.

362
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:31,012
Yeah, that way we don't
look like idiots at our meeting.

363
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:37,935
- I'm sorry. Register's closed.
- Sorry.

364
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:44,984
Mr. Butabi,
where's the other cash register?

365
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:51,948
Steve? I was just thinking. Dad
would be really proud of us right now.

366
00:40:53,116 --> 00:40:57,954
What are you idiots doing? I pay you
to take money and push a button.

367
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,875
Are your delicate fingers injured?

368
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:06,879
- We're working our asses off.
- Our weeks filling up quick.

369
00:41:07,087 --> 00:41:10,841
We've made
important business contacts.

370
00:41:11,091 --> 00:41:13,843
Dancing the Macarena
with Donald Trump?

371
00:41:14,094 --> 00:41:17,805
You're always telling us
to do something with our lives.

372
00:41:18,056 --> 00:41:22,977
You never support us or care about
what's important to us, right?

373
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:27,940
- Yeah ... for the most part.
- Even your brother isn't convinced.

374
00:41:29,107 --> 00:41:33,945
Why? He uses his brain, unlike you.
You're a loser! New policy.

375
00:41:35,113 --> 00:41:39,992
No more clubs.
Yes! Your life is retail.

376
00:41:41,118 --> 00:41:43,871
- Go clean the stockroom.
- You know what?

377
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:49,001
Not only will we not clean out
the stockroom, we're out of here!

378
00:41:50,085 --> 00:41:55,006
What about the stockroom?

379
00:41:55,089 --> 00:41:57,842
We don't need you.
We made huge-ass contacts last night.

380
00:41:58,092 --> 00:42:01,804
Plus we met these girls, Dad.

381
00:42:02,054 --> 00:42:05,808
We'll make it without you.
You'lI see.

382
00:42:06,058 --> 00:42:10,979
I'lI see when you come home, begging
for food and shelter. Morons!

383
00:42:11,062 --> 00:42:15,984
Steve? You're an ass, Doug.
You want to go to the beach later?

384
00:42:18,111 --> 00:42:21,864
I know a beach where you don't have
to wear a bathing suit.

385
00:42:22,114 --> 00:42:27,035
- Plus with my milky white skin ...
- This is a major family crisis.

386
00:42:38,087 --> 00:42:42,967
Just give me a call if you wanna
go out. Or just call me anyway.

387
00:43:21,085 --> 00:43:24,797
You notice we forgot to ask her
something. That's weird.

388
00:43:25,047 --> 00:43:29,926
We're in serious relationships right
now, and our ladies can trust us.

389
00:43:30,052 --> 00:43:34,973
Why go out for burgers,
when you got steak at home?

390
00:43:44,106 --> 00:43:47,860
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, fine.

391
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:51,863
- Doug and Steve Butabi.
- You're brothers?

392
00:43:52,113 --> 00:43:56,993
- We can't get into that right now.
- Your names are not on the list.

393
00:43:58,077 --> 00:43:59,912
We have a meeting.

394
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:04,959
- Doug, Mr. Zadir!
- Security.

395
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:11,840
- Dooey ... Yeah. Up top.
- Main man.

396
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:17,011
- Raging party last night.
- ls that what my mother told you?

397
00:44:17,095 --> 00:44:20,848
- What?
- The fluffy whip was a big hit.

398
00:44:21,098 --> 00:44:25,978
- I was sent out looking for more.
- You, sir, are a party animal.

399
00:44:26,103 --> 00:44:31,024
It's been great spending quality
time, but we're meeting Mr. Zadir.

400
00:44:31,108 --> 00:44:34,861
Zadir was drunk last night.
He doesn't even remember you.

401
00:44:35,111 --> 00:44:39,991
You think you're the first losers
I've had to get rid of on a Monday?

402
00:44:40,074 --> 00:44:44,995
- Are we being blown off?
- Actually, you're being kicked out.

403
00:44:55,046 --> 00:44:59,967
That doesn't feel good at all ...

404
00:45:00,092 --> 00:45:03,846
- What's going on?
- Just some trespassers.

405
00:45:04,096 --> 00:45:09,017
- And the boys from last night?
- I haven't located them yet.

406
00:45:10,102 --> 00:45:12,854
Dooey, did you just grab my ass?

407
00:45:13,104 --> 00:45:17,984
From where I'm standing,
that's a physical impossibility.

408
00:45:18,109 --> 00:45:22,988
I know your tricks, Dooey.

409
00:45:33,081 --> 00:45:36,834
Maybe we should just go back to work.

410
00:45:37,085 --> 00:45:41,964
Maybe we should go to college, not
put gel in our hair and wear jeans!

411
00:45:42,089 --> 00:45:47,010
- Let's do that, Steve!
- Sorry.

412
00:45:51,097 --> 00:45:54,851
Cambi's number.

413
00:45:55,101 --> 00:45:59,981
- We had a pretty sweet time, right?
- Sweet-ass time.

414
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:19,832
So you do travel to places
other than Japan.

415
00:46:20,082 --> 00:46:25,004
- These hotties are sweet.
- Sweet ass sweet.

416
00:46:25,087 --> 00:46:28,840
- Who is it?
- Just a bunch of pound signs.

417
00:46:29,091 --> 00:46:33,970
- Are you doing it right?
- You have to hit the pound sign.

418
00:46:36,097 --> 00:46:41,018
You have to put in our number
and then hit the pound sign.

419
00:46:43,104 --> 00:46:45,856
Excuse me, Bill Nye, the science guy.

420
00:46:46,106 --> 00:46:50,986
That's a sweet show, too.

421
00:46:52,028 --> 00:46:56,991
Cambi, it's your boyfriend.
Look, I need to see you.

422
00:46:58,076 --> 00:47:01,829
- I'm at the Skybar.
- We'll be rig there.

423
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:07,000
- Nice.
- I was focused the whole time.

424
00:47:07,084 --> 00:47:10,837
Did you have a good time last night?

425
00:47:11,087 --> 00:47:14,841
I had a great time.
I think we've reached a point -

426
00:47:15,091 --> 00:47:18,845
- where I can call you Viv
and leave out the "ica".

427
00:47:19,095 --> 00:47:23,974
You wanna hang out
or do what we did last night?

428
00:47:24,099 --> 00:47:29,021
- Or eat, then do what we did?
- Sounds good.

429
00:47:30,063 --> 00:47:34,943
- Have your boarding passes ready.
- You'lI have to check your bag.

430
00:47:36,069 --> 00:47:40,990
The movie on this flight will be ...
I can't think of any more.

431
00:47:43,075 --> 00:47:47,955
- Where's your car?
- Our dad got mad, took it away.

432
00:47:49,081 --> 00:47:53,960
We used to work for him, but we quit
today. Actually, we're unemployed.

433
00:47:55,086 --> 00:47:59,966
- You don't work with Mr. Zadir?
- We just met him last night.

434
00:48:00,091 --> 00:48:05,012
- We will be. So no, but yes.
- If we ever get to see him again.

435
00:48:11,143 --> 00:48:15,980
- You don't need boarding passes.
- Get away from us.

436
00:48:16,064 --> 00:48:19,859
- You guys are a big waste of time.
- Como what?

437
00:48:20,067 --> 00:48:24,989
- Steve, you're a jerkoff.
- I'm glad you shared that with me.

438
00:48:25,072 --> 00:48:29,951
- It's a big step for both of us.
- Consider last night a favor.

439
00:48:30,077 --> 00:48:33,830
Now do us a favor.
Never talk to us again!

440
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,833
- What did we do? We'll change.
- You can't change.

441
00:48:37,083 --> 00:48:40,836
You are ugly, pathetic losers.

442
00:48:41,087 --> 00:48:45,966
I can't believe we actually had sex
with these asswads!

443
00:48:46,091 --> 00:48:51,012
That's the problem. Poor schmucks
look just the same as rich schmucks.

444
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:08,987
- No ... Yes ...
- This is the worst day of my life.

445
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:12,824
I'd really appreciate it
if you didn't talk to me right now.

446
00:49:13,074 --> 00:49:15,827
I don't know how to respond to that.

447
00:49:16,077 --> 00:49:20,998
Big surprise. You don't know how to
work the clubs, talk to the ladies.

448
00:49:23,083 --> 00:49:27,963
You only know how to ask me
how to do everything!

449
00:49:28,088 --> 00:49:31,842
That's why everything has gone
wrong. You're holding me back.

450
00:49:32,092 --> 00:49:37,055
You're like this thing tied to my
leg, this dragging thing on a chain.

451
00:49:41,058 --> 00:49:44,853
- A lead weight?
- Yes, thank you. But not anymore!

452
00:49:45,062 --> 00:49:47,856
Nothing. That's all. Nothing.

453
00:49:48,065 --> 00:49:52,986
You can't blame me. Today was just
a series of random events gone awry.

454
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:58,991
Maybe they wouldn't go awry
if I had someone next to me with a brain!

455
00:50:00,076 --> 00:50:04,997
You know what? Dad was right.
You are a loser.

456
00:50:06,081 --> 00:50:11,002
You know what, Steve?
I lied. You're not good looking.

457
00:50:12,087 --> 00:50:15,882
Did you say something? I can't hear
things from that low to the ground.

458
00:50:16,132 --> 00:50:21,012
- Consider me your ex-brother.
- I don't care.

459
00:50:21,095 --> 00:50:24,848
Care about this?
You want the real thing?

460
00:50:25,057 --> 00:50:26,892
- Do you want ..?
- Stop talking to me.

461
00:50:27,059 --> 00:50:31,938
Fine. My pleasure.

462
00:51:12,058 --> 00:51:16,980
Little Post-lts, you little idiot.

463
00:51:18,064 --> 00:51:22,985
Get out, 'cos I hate you.

464
00:51:30,075 --> 00:51:34,996
- You should take a lesson from it.
- Grieco.

465
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:03,939
- You'll be very happy with these.
- How long do they last?

466
00:52:05,065 --> 00:52:08,819
They last forever. They're silk.
They'll always be in bloom.

467
00:52:09,069 --> 00:52:13,990
They'll never die, never change.
Never say you're not good looking.

468
00:52:16,117 --> 00:52:21,038
They'll always be in your room, not
suddenly move to the guest house.

469
00:52:22,123 --> 00:52:27,002
Something has come up. Excuse me.

470
00:52:27,085 --> 00:52:31,965
- All the customers are depressed.
- It's just that I miss Doug.

471
00:52:33,091 --> 00:52:36,844
- He's in the guest house. It's a mansion.
- There's no cable.

472
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:41,932
- Yes, there is. They have Cinemax.
- But there's no HBO. God!

473
00:52:46,061 --> 00:52:49,815
- Feel it right here. Squeeze.
- Hey, Steve.

474
00:52:50,065 --> 00:52:53,860
I heard about your brother.

475
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:59,031
- So when are we gonna go out?
- I know a place with spinach wraps.

476
00:52:59,115 --> 00:53:03,994
I know you've had you heart set on
this, but the truth is, I'm a rebel.

477
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:08,832
You're like this
sweet-girl-from-next-door type.

478
00:53:09,082 --> 00:53:13,962
I go to college. Translation: Drunken
orgies with occasional Cliff notes.

479
00:53:16,089 --> 00:53:20,968
lt sounds good, but I just got out
of this very serious relationship.

480
00:53:21,052 --> 00:53:24,847
I have to nurse my emotional wounds.

481
00:53:25,055 --> 00:53:28,850
That could take till ... Saturday.

482
00:53:29,101 --> 00:53:33,938
That's perfect. Your dad got us tickets
for David Copperfield this Saturday.

483
00:53:34,105 --> 00:53:39,026
It's gonna be so much fun
to see things appear and disappear.

484
00:53:44,114 --> 00:53:48,994
I'lI see you.

485
00:53:51,079 --> 00:53:55,959
- Oh, man. Great glutes.
- I don't care.

486
00:54:22,108 --> 00:54:27,029
- That's expensive.
- Gotta go.

487
00:54:28,113 --> 00:54:32,993
Who decorates like this?
Steve, come on.

488
00:55:03,103 --> 00:55:07,983
"Business. Human Relationships
in Management."

489
00:55:09,109 --> 00:55:12,821
"Covers the development of ..."

490
00:55:13,071 --> 00:55:16,824
Here's one. "Business Computer
Systems." That's a good one.

491
00:55:17,075 --> 00:55:21,954
Machines are Doug's thing.
I'm more of a people person.

492
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:27,960
A business man must have knowledge
of computers. Come on.

493
00:55:29,044 --> 00:55:33,965
Here's another one.
"Venture Management."

494
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:39,011
Gosh, Emily, school?
I'lI have to read, and homework ...

495
00:55:40,096 --> 00:55:43,849
Teachers saying: "Would you share
that with the rest of the class?"

496
00:55:44,099 --> 00:55:46,852
Do you want me to be less horny?

497
00:55:47,102 --> 00:55:51,982
- No, that wouldn't be good.
- Look, here's what we do.

498
00:55:52,107 --> 00:55:56,986
First, we combine the stores, okay?
Then we can add the furniture.

499
00:55:59,071 --> 00:56:01,824
Recliners and sofa beds ...

500
00:56:02,074 --> 00:56:05,828
- And end tables and ...
- Chairs.

501
00:56:06,078 --> 00:56:10,999
- Oh, yes, chairs.
- Ottomans.

502
00:56:11,082 --> 00:56:15,962
Yes, ottomans. We're gonna be bigger
than lkea ... Home Depot.

503
00:56:21,092 --> 00:56:25,971
lkea!

504
00:56:34,104 --> 00:56:38,983
I think we're moving way too fast.
You're talking like we're married.

505
00:56:41,068 --> 00:56:45,948
Oh, Steve.
You just made me so happy.

506
00:56:46,073 --> 00:56:49,826
What? No, I don't mean that.

507
00:56:50,077 --> 00:56:55,039
It's just that I don't ...

508
00:56:58,084 --> 00:57:03,005
Okay.

509
00:57:12,097 --> 00:57:16,976
Doug, if I'm not mistaken,
this place has got it going on!

510
00:57:18,061 --> 00:57:21,814
I owe you big time for inviting me.

511
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:26,985
Who wants to dance?
I call this one the sprinkler.

512
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:33,950
You think it would be okay to wear
this to your brother's wedding?

513
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:39,038
Your brother's wedding, man.
What are you gonna wear?

514
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:43,959
You have to hand it to Steve.
That Emily is the perfect woman.

515
00:57:44,084 --> 00:57:49,006
Strong legs, tight stomach,
positive mental attitude ...

516
00:57:49,089 --> 00:57:53,968
- She can really keep you on track.
- Shut up .. ! ldiot.

517
00:57:57,096 --> 00:58:00,808
Just because you and your brother
are having problems, -

518
00:58:01,058 --> 00:58:05,938
- that's no reason to refer to my
intellect in a diminutive manner.

519
00:58:07,064 --> 00:58:11,985
I'm sorry. It's just ...

520
00:58:12,068 --> 00:58:15,864
Can we not talk
about my brother for a second?

521
00:58:16,114 --> 00:58:21,035
- 1 0-4. Boundary set.
- Thank you.

522
00:58:21,077 --> 00:58:25,956
I'm having a hell of a time.

523
00:58:32,087 --> 00:58:37,008
At this moment, I want to make
a toast to Steve and Emily, -

524
00:58:37,091 --> 00:58:41,929
- who after tomorrow
will be Mr. and Mrs. Steven Butabi.

525
00:58:42,054 --> 00:58:45,808
- Emily Sanderson-Butabi.
- Whoever.

526
00:58:46,058 --> 00:58:50,979
I would like to thank my parents,
who came in all the way from Maine.

527
00:58:54,107 --> 00:58:59,028
- Despite Mom's sciatica.
- Terrific, sir.

528
00:59:00,112 --> 00:59:05,034
And the Butabis, who came in
all the way from Yayman.

529
00:59:05,075 --> 00:59:09,955
- Yemen.
- And that's not the only union.

530
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:15,001
- We got a new lamp-plant store.
- Plant-lamp store. Much better.

531
00:59:16,085 --> 00:59:19,839
- Seriously, it sounds better.
- Steve?

532
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:22,800
You want to make a toast?

533
00:59:23,050 --> 00:59:27,930
I think you should make a toast.
All the men are making toasts.

534
00:59:31,099 --> 00:59:35,937
Okay, I just want to say,
"What's up, Grandma, Grandpa?"

535
00:59:37,105 --> 00:59:41,984
And to the other two old people,
"What's up?"

536
00:59:42,109 --> 00:59:45,863
- Yeah, you.
- Very nice.

537
00:59:46,113 --> 00:59:51,034
Steve is thrilled
that this family's coming together.

538
00:59:51,076 --> 00:59:55,955
I'd like to show you some of our
business plans for after the merger.

539
01:00:01,085 --> 01:00:05,923
Dad? ls there any way
we can cancel this whole thing?

540
01:00:06,048 --> 01:00:10,969
- Yes ... No!
- That is so funny.

541
01:00:12,095 --> 01:00:17,016
But it's like Emily turned out to be
this whole different other person.

542
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:19,852
Let me explain something.

543
01:00:20,102 --> 01:00:25,024
The caterer has been paid.
Your grandparents came.

544
01:00:25,107 --> 01:00:28,860
All men are nervous
the night before their wedding.

545
01:00:29,111 --> 01:00:33,990
All guys are nervous and kind of
hope she eats a can of botulism?

546
01:00:36,075 --> 01:00:40,997
She could hang out with a deer and
accidentally be shot by a hunter.

547
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:44,833
You know, when she's sleeping she
makes that nose whistle sound, -

548
01:00:45,042 --> 01:00:49,921
- and you want to ram her toothbrush
up her nostril into her skull.

549
01:00:53,091 --> 01:00:57,970
These are perfectly normal feelings.

550
01:01:04,101 --> 01:01:09,022
Doug, are you there? It's Steve.

551
01:01:18,072 --> 01:01:22,993
Hi, you've reached Doug Butabi.
I'm outside living it up.

552
01:01:23,077 --> 01:01:25,829
Unlike my pussywhipped brother -

553
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:31,001
- who's too busy throwing his life away
for Emily. Beep.

554
01:01:31,042 --> 01:01:35,964
Doug? Sorry I missed you.
I guess I'm getting married -

555
01:01:36,089 --> 01:01:41,010
- and I'm just wondering
if you wanted to be my best man.

556
01:01:42,094 --> 01:01:43,888
Give me a call or page me.

557
01:01:44,096 --> 01:01:49,017
I'm in our room still
across from the pool.

558
01:01:49,101 --> 01:01:53,980
See you.

559
01:01:58,109 --> 01:02:02,988
- Let's go over this one more time.
- I know my duties as best man.

560
01:02:03,072 --> 01:02:07,951
I walk down the aisle.
I stand next to you.

561
01:02:08,076 --> 01:02:11,788
- I settle interwedding skirmishes.
- No, no ...

562
01:02:12,038 --> 01:02:17,001
You're the best man. Not the wedding
bouncer. You just back me up.

563
01:02:18,086 --> 01:02:23,007
Like, if things get too heavy,
I step in like a spotter.

564
01:02:23,090 --> 01:02:25,843
- Yeah, right.
- Thanks, man.

565
01:02:26,093 --> 01:02:31,014
Let's go. We're ready, let's go.

566
01:02:32,098 --> 01:02:37,020
Do you want your kid blessed or not?

567
01:02:38,104 --> 01:02:43,025
- Richard Grieco. You know Steve?
- I just don't want to be sued.

568
01:02:44,068 --> 01:02:48,989
No, listen to me. You can't get your
kid confirmed for less than $1 50.

569
01:02:49,072 --> 01:02:52,784
You want your kid blessed,
you call me.

570
01:02:53,034 --> 01:02:57,955
Dad, I didn't have a bachelor party.
That's a major part of a wedding.

571
01:03:00,082 --> 01:03:05,004
So could we delay a couple of hours
so that we could go to a strip club?

572
01:03:05,087 --> 01:03:09,966
I have to go. Leave me a message.

573
01:03:11,092 --> 01:03:14,846
Hey ... Steve getting married.
You're the man!

574
01:03:15,096 --> 01:03:19,976
Shut up, Craig. I'm walking
down the aisle, you dick!

575
01:03:21,102 --> 01:03:25,981
I told you to wear white.
Grandma, get off the phone.

576
01:03:40,077 --> 01:03:42,830
Dearly beloved. We're gathered
here today to join ...

577
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:47,960
Did we already start? Oh.

578
01:03:48,085 --> 01:03:53,006
I thought there was supposed
to be a buzzer or a whistle or something.

579
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:56,843
... to join together this man
and this woman in holy matrimony.

580
01:03:57,093 --> 01:04:01,972
But first I understand the bride and
groom have each prepared something.

581
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:10,021
"Dear Steve. They say if you set
something free and it comes back -

582
01:04:11,106 --> 01:04:14,859
- you should love it forever.
Like one of your silk plants, -

583
01:04:15,068 --> 01:04:19,947
- I'll try to stay beautiful. I know
our lives together will be great."

584
01:04:20,072 --> 01:04:23,826
"Just like when we saw David
Copperfield on our first date."

585
01:04:24,076 --> 01:04:28,997
"Love Emily."

586
01:04:35,086 --> 01:04:38,840
"I used to see you outside
my father's store -

587
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:43,969
- and then we went on some dates
and you let me have sex with you."

588
01:04:52,102 --> 01:04:54,854
Oh, I'm done.

589
01:04:55,063 --> 01:04:59,942
If anyone has reason to believe
that this man or woman -

590
01:05:00,067 --> 01:05:04,989
- should not be married, speak now
or forever hold your peace.

591
01:05:05,072 --> 01:05:09,951
- What's up? From out of town?
- Don't hit on the bridesmaid.

592
01:05:11,077 --> 01:05:15,957
- It's your wedding.
- Wait till after the ceremony.

593
01:05:18,084 --> 01:05:23,005
Do you promise to love Emily for
as long as you both shall live?

594
01:05:23,088 --> 01:05:27,968
My dad already paid the caterer.

595
01:05:29,136 --> 01:05:33,973
Do you promise to love Steven for
as long as you both shall live?

596
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:38,978
- Steven, repeat after me.
- After me.

597
01:05:44,066 --> 01:05:48,987
- With this ring, I thee wed.
- With this ring, I thee wed.

598
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:54,826
Now, Emily.

599
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:59,956
With this ring ...

600
01:06:06,086 --> 01:06:11,049
Doug!

601
01:06:13,134 --> 01:06:16,888
- What the hell's he doing here?
- Make him stop.

602
01:06:17,138 --> 01:06:19,849
Turn that music off!

603
01:06:20,057 --> 01:06:24,979
You know
what I paid for this wedding?

604
01:06:25,062 --> 01:06:29,941
Don't do that with your head.
That's so dumb!

605
01:06:30,067 --> 01:06:33,820
- Mr. Butabi, I can't ...
- Keep going. You want to get paid?

606
01:06:34,070 --> 01:06:38,991
- You're out of my will!
- I told you he was a jerk!

607
01:06:51,127 --> 01:06:56,007
Emily ... Sorry. I'm not ready yet.

608
01:06:56,132 --> 01:07:01,012
- Steve, stop!
- Nice poem, though. Sorry, Dad.

609
01:07:01,095 --> 01:07:05,974
Steve, come back here!
Don't you leave me. I'm not kidding.

610
01:07:07,059 --> 01:07:11,938
Mr. Butabi, as an actor and observer
of human nature, I can tell you -

611
01:07:12,063 --> 01:07:16,985
- that your son is not ready
for this sort of commitment.

612
01:07:20,071 --> 01:07:24,992
- Hello.
- Hey.

613
01:07:30,122 --> 01:07:33,875
- Go ahead, Father.
- What are you doing?

614
01:07:34,125 --> 01:07:39,046
Emily, Steve's discipline is lacking
as is his appreciation for you.

615
01:07:40,131 --> 01:07:45,010
Now, I can bench press 305 pound,
and my body fat is less than 2%.

616
01:07:49,056 --> 01:07:53,935
I am a professional trainer. I also
hope to market my own protein bar.

617
01:07:54,060 --> 01:07:58,981
Plus, I've always loved you.

618
01:08:01,067 --> 01:08:04,820
Okay. But we should
look into infomercials.

619
01:08:05,070 --> 01:08:09,991
- This is a completely new fee. Cool?
- Yeah.

620
01:08:12,118 --> 01:08:17,040
Okay. Dearly beloved,
we're gathered here again today ...

621
01:08:19,125 --> 01:08:23,963
Also, I took Craig clubbing.

622
01:08:24,088 --> 01:08:26,840
That was all right.

623
01:08:27,090 --> 01:08:31,970
Plus I rented a lot of videos.
I didn't do much else.

624
01:08:36,057 --> 01:08:40,978
Look, Steve ...

625
01:08:42,063 --> 01:08:46,984
I'm sorry.
I said a lot of bad things before.

626
01:08:49,069 --> 01:08:53,990
I've been thinking ...
You're my brother.

627
01:08:55,116 --> 01:08:59,996
We're brothers,
and when we're together ...

628
01:09:02,123 --> 01:09:07,002
I just ...

629
01:09:07,085 --> 01:09:10,839
You don't drag me down.

630
01:09:11,089 --> 01:09:15,969
I drag me down.

631
01:09:17,053 --> 01:09:19,847
And you ...

632
01:09:20,056 --> 01:09:22,850
You complete me.

633
01:09:23,058 --> 01:09:26,812
- Shut up.
- What?

634
01:09:27,062 --> 01:09:31,983
Just shut up.
You had me at "hello".

635
01:09:46,121 --> 01:09:51,001
lt seems to me, you're a bit harder
on Doug than you are on Steve.

636
01:09:54,087 --> 01:09:59,008
It's true. It's just that Doug is
so rebellious. I can't control him.

637
01:10:00,051 --> 01:10:01,886
But rebellious, scrappy, dreamer ...

638
01:10:02,053 --> 01:10:06,974
What other young man
does that remind you of?

639
01:10:08,058 --> 01:10:12,979
- MyseIf as a kid.
- So who are you really fighting with?

640
01:10:15,106 --> 01:10:19,986
Mr. Grieco ...
You see right through me.

641
01:10:34,082 --> 01:10:37,835
I missed this car.
I look good in it.

642
01:10:38,086 --> 01:10:39,879
And you look good also.

643
01:10:40,046 --> 01:10:44,967
Thanks.
Glad you moved back into the room.

644
01:10:45,050 --> 01:10:48,845
Dad was cool about the wedding
after his chat with Grieco.

645
01:10:49,054 --> 01:10:53,975
And it really improved
your relationship with him.

646
01:10:58,104 --> 01:11:01,857
- ls that an outside nightclub?
- That's your idea.

647
01:11:02,108 --> 01:11:07,029
Pull over. Let's check it out.

648
01:11:12,075 --> 01:11:16,996
- We only let people in on the list.
- We're on the list.

649
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:21,959
- Steve and Doug Butabi.
- Step right in.

650
01:11:24,044 --> 01:11:28,966
- Go right in.
- I guess we should go in then.

651
01:11:32,093 --> 01:11:37,015
- We're gonna go in.
- We're going in.

652
01:11:38,099 --> 01:11:43,020
I can't believe we got in.
Sure it wasn't a mistake?

653
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:47,983
- It's weird to be in here.
- But they stole your idea.

654
01:11:53,071 --> 01:11:57,950
Butabis? I've been looking
all over for you. Come here!

655
01:11:58,076 --> 01:12:01,829
- Mr. Zadir!
- How do you like our club?

656
01:12:02,079 --> 01:12:05,833
- Our club?
- I cut you in. lt was your idea.

657
01:12:06,083 --> 01:12:10,962
- Sweet ass sweet.
- Running a club is hard work.

658
01:12:11,087 --> 01:12:13,840
- Don't worry about it.
- We're workaholics.

659
01:12:14,048 --> 01:12:19,011
Dooey just called from Pismo Beach.
He says he didn't grab your ass.

660
01:12:19,095 --> 01:12:20,888
What is he up to now?

661
01:12:21,097 --> 01:12:25,976
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

662
01:12:26,101 --> 01:12:31,022
- Let's do some business.
- All right.

663
01:12:33,066 --> 01:12:36,819
- Put some cherries on that.
- Nice call.

664
01:12:37,070 --> 01:12:41,949
- Mr. Butabi, can you approve this?
- That looks fine and all that.

665
01:12:43,075 --> 01:12:45,828
- Hi, Mr. Barntabi.
- It's Butabi, but that's okay.

666
01:12:46,078 --> 01:12:50,999
How's the hair?
Successful-club-owner good?

667
01:12:51,041 --> 01:12:55,962
That voice sounds so familiar.

668
01:12:58,089 --> 01:13:01,842
- Are you ..?
- Doug?

669
01:13:02,093 --> 01:13:07,014
- Credit vixen?
- My God, I can't believe this.

670
01:13:07,097 --> 01:13:09,850
You're even more beautiful
than you sound.

671
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:14,979
- You stopped calling.
- Not because I didn't want to.

672
01:13:16,064 --> 01:13:20,985
Am I what you expected?

673
01:13:21,068 --> 01:13:24,822
I totally approve.

674
01:13:25,072 --> 01:13:29,951
- You're not here with anyone?
- Just my friend.

675
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:33,913
Hottie police officer?

676
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:39,001
I was really looking forward
to meeting you in court on June 6th.

677
01:13:40,086 --> 01:13:45,007
- So, do you guys wanna dance?
- No.

678
01:13:46,091 --> 01:13:49,845
- Yes.
- Yes.

679
01:13:50,095 --> 01:13:55,016
- Oh, I love this song.
- I'm getting kind of sick of it.

680
01:14:37,096 --> 01:14:41,934
I broke the window again.
