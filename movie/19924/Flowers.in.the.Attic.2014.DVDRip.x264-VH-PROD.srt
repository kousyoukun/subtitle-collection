A GARDEN IN THE ATTIC.

485

GRANDMOTHER?

486
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:35,190
WON'T SHE PUNISH US?

487

I TURNED TO

THAT ONLY MADE MY MOTHER
MORE JEALOUS.

00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:14,363
AND SHE TOOK EVERY
OPPORTUNITY SHE COULD...

506
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,091
OVER THE YEARS, MY FATHER
BECAME MORE AND MORE BUSY...

507

HIS MOTHER HAD RECENTLY DIED
AND MY FAMILY TOOK HIM IN.

HE WAS ONLY
A FEW YEARS OLDER THAN ME.

COME ON.

1436
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:14,772
I'LL CUT THE ELECTRICITY
AND MEET YOU AT THE LAKE.

1437
01:27:14,829 --> 01:27:15,830
NO! NO!

1438
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:17,706
WE'RE NOT
GOING WITHOUT YOU.

1439
01:27:18,733 --> 01:27:20,735
HURRY!
WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS TRAIN.

1440
01:27:20,802 --> 01:27:21,906
STOP!

1441
01:27:21,970 --> 01:27:23,881
STOP, IF YOU KNOW
WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU!

1442
01:27:27,375 --> 01:27:29,377
PLEASE...

1443
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:33,681
WE'RE CORRINE'S CHILDREN.

1444
01:27:37,318 --> 01:27:38,388
MY GOD.

1445
01:27:41,556 --> 01:27:42,466
GO.

1446
01:27:42,624 --> 01:27:43,728
BEFORE I'M SENT
AFTER YOU!

1447
01:27:43,791 --> 01:27:44,997
I'LL CUT THE POWER
ON THE FENCE.

1448
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:46,739
GO!

1449
01:27:52,634 --> 01:27:54,807
[CHUGGING]

1450
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:16,031
WE NEVER HAVE TO SEE
THAT PLACE AGAIN, CATH.

1451
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:18,771
IT'S ALL OVER.

1452
01:28:19,627 --> 01:28:22,506
(CATHY) AND FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN A LONG TIME...

1453
01:28:22,563 --> 01:28:24,668
WE FELT ALIVE...

1454
01:28:24,732 --> 01:28:25,836
FREE.

1455
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:28,005
WE HAD EVERYTHING AHEAD OF US.

1456
01:28:30,038 --> 01:28:33,884
BUT SOMEDAY,
WE'D SEE MOM AGAIN.

1457
01:28:33,941 --> 01:28:36,547
AND WE'D LOOK HER
STRAIGHT IN THE EYE...

1458
01:28:37,345 --> 01:28:39,689
THE CHILDREN SHE ONCE LOVED...

1459
01:28:40,348 --> 01:28:42,692
AND ALL OUR SHAME
AND HOPELESSNESS...

1460
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:44,923
WOULD BECOME HERS.

1461
01:28:50,992 --> 01:28:57,705
