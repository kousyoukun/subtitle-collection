<i>People use the color yellow</i>

2
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,979
<i>To symbolize hope.</i>

00:00:31,128 --> 00:00:32,554
<i>Yellow...</i>

4
00:00:32,756 --> 00:00:36,879

00:00:38,937 --> 00:00:39,673
<i>I thought life would be</i>

00:00:39,775 --> 00:00:40,285
<i>Like one long and perfect</i>
<i>summer day.</i>

8

9
00:00:49,405 --> 00:00:51,619

<i>With blond hair</i>
<i>and porcelain skin.</i>

11

<i>We looked like</i>
<i>those fancy dresden dolls</i>

12
00:00:58,461 --> 00:01:00,771
<i>That grace shelves</i>

16
00:01:14,453 --> 00:01:15,401
<i>"life is full of surprises,"</i>
<i>my mother used to say.</i>

17
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:25,119
<i>And greed and fear and shame,</i>
<i>as I soon learned.</i>

18
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,751
<i>And hopelessness.</i>

Give them back,
christopher.

Hey. What do you kids

Oh! I missed you all
so much!

bring us?

[lid thumps]

30
00:02:38,401 --> 00:02:40,037
For you, son.

31
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,001
Thank you.

32
00:02:43,089 --> 00:02:45,882
Did you
forget about me?

00:02:48,195 --> 00:02:49,188
Mm!

00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,533
I could never
forget about you.

I wish you never
had to go away

00:03:36,844 --> 00:03:38,094
For work again.

46
00:03:38,096 --> 00:03:39,732
Promise me
you won't.

47
00:03:39,734 --> 00:03:41,145
I hate to break up the party,

48
00:03:41,147 --> 00:03:43,135
But dinner's almost ready,
and I made your favorite--

49
00:03:43,137 --> 00:03:44,516
Homemade apple pie.

50
00:03:44,518 --> 00:03:45,672
Corrine,
you shouldn't have.

51
00:03:45,674 --> 00:03:47,567
She didn't.

52
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:50,425
You forgot to
take off the bakery label.

53
00:03:50,427 --> 00:03:53,732
Ugh. Cathy! Could never
get anything past you, huh?

54
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,242
Yeah, mom.

55
00:03:55,244 --> 00:03:56,494
What's going on?

56
00:03:56,496 --> 00:03:57,649
I mean, you're wearing
a new dress and perfume.

57
00:03:57,651 --> 00:04:01,022
Well, the wife
of a vice-president

58
00:04:01,024 --> 00:04:02,980
Can't wear
just any old thing.

59
00:04:02,982 --> 00:04:05,966
I was gonna wait
until it was 100% official,

60
00:04:05,968 --> 00:04:07,669
But I got promoted,

61
00:04:07,671 --> 00:04:10,783
And I'm now the head of sales
of the entire east coast.

62
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:11,971
That's great!

63
00:04:11,973 --> 00:04:12,998
[dad]: Thank you.

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,444
[corrine]: He got promoted!

65
00:04:16,725 --> 00:04:18,233
He's so smart, that's why.

66
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,504
[sniffling]

67

Nobody's here.

69
00:04:31,816 --> 00:04:33,646
Cathy...

70
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:34,866
Hey.

71
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,976
[sighs softly]

72
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:40,711
This is a big
opportunity for me.

73
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,959
For all of us.

74
00:04:42,961 --> 00:04:45,592
I know what's
gonna happen.

75
00:04:45,594 --> 00:04:47,358
You'll be away
all the time.

76
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,573
Mom will be busy
with the twins.

77
00:04:49,575 --> 00:04:53,234
Christopher will act like
he's the man of the house.

78
00:04:53,236 --> 00:04:55,899
[sighing]
I'll be totally forgotten.

79
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:57,825
Can I tell you a secret?

80
00:04:57,827 --> 00:05:00,042
I bought this...

81
00:05:00,044 --> 00:05:01,711
On my last trip,

82
00:05:01,713 --> 00:05:03,670
And it's more money
than I should've spent,

83
00:05:03,672 --> 00:05:05,757
But the moment
I saw it,

84
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,551
I knew you
had to have it.

85
00:05:15,327 --> 00:05:16,964
[chuckles softly]

86
00:05:18,025 --> 00:05:19,051
So, when I'm traveling,

87
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:20,978
I need you
to be strong.

88
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,001
Can you do that for me?

89
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:32,409
Mommy!
Cathy's hurting me!

90
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:33,501
It wouldn't hurt so much

91
00:05:33,503 --> 00:05:35,299
If you'd sit still
for five seconds.

92
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:36,584
Girls, please.

93
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,836
Your dad's gonna be home
in less than two hours,

94
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,152
I need to ice the cake,
chill the champagne--

95
00:05:39,154 --> 00:05:40,212
Where are your brothers?

96
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:42,299
Why do I have to
wear a tie?

97
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:43,969
'cause we're
the "dresden dolls."

98
00:05:43,971 --> 00:05:45,350
I don't wanna
be a doll.

99
00:05:45,352 --> 00:05:47,212
It's just a saying,
darling.

100
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:49,172
Because the neighbors
think we look so perfect.

101
00:05:49,174 --> 00:05:51,162
[chuckles]:
We are perfect.

102
00:05:54,246 --> 00:05:56,814
[music plays on the stereo,
people chatter]

103
00:05:58,806 --> 00:06:01,246
[d]

104
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,255
Why isn't
he here yet?

105
00:06:06,257 --> 00:06:08,342
He's probably just
stuck in traffic.

106
00:06:08,344 --> 00:06:10,044
When are we gonna
eat the cake?

107
00:06:10,045 --> 00:06:11,199
I want it now!

108
00:06:11,201 --> 00:06:12,388
Can I take off
my tie, please?

109
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,447
Just be patient,
darlings, okay?

110
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:15,920
I'm going to go
freshen the ice.

111
00:06:15,922 --> 00:06:17,236
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

112
00:06:17,238 --> 00:06:18,970
-[car door shuts]
I hear someone in the driveway.

113
00:06:18,972 --> 00:06:20,768
[excited murmuring
and bustling]

114
00:06:23,499 --> 00:06:26,581
[door creaks open]

115
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,411
[footsteps approaching]

116
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,613
Mrs. Dollanganger?

117
00:06:33,615 --> 00:06:36,503
I'm sorry, but, um...

118
00:06:36,505 --> 00:06:39,971
There's been
an accident.

119
00:06:39,973 --> 00:06:42,861
[d]

120
00:07:07,813 --> 00:07:09,738
Mama?

121
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,628
[d]

122
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,779
Mom?

123
00:07:27,143 --> 00:07:29,358
Alright, guys,
five more minutes.

124
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,348
Is daddy
coming home tonight?

125
00:07:35,332 --> 00:07:37,193
No.

126
00:07:38,671 --> 00:07:40,628
Remember? We told you.

127
00:07:41,882 --> 00:07:43,615
He died.

128
00:07:45,607 --> 00:07:48,431
Sometimes,
when I really miss him,

129
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:50,358
I just pretend
he's on a business trip

130
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,992
And that he'll
be back any day.

131
00:07:55,369 --> 00:07:57,423
You guys wash up for dinner.

132
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,203
[footsteps]

133
00:08:03,205 --> 00:08:04,776
[sighs]

134
00:08:06,576 --> 00:08:09,657
Mom, um, the twins want you
to read them a story.

135
00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:10,685
Is that the mail?

136
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,245
Madame pomfrey says

137
00:08:15,247 --> 00:08:17,331
I can't stay
in ballet class,

138
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,355
Unless we pay
for last month.

139
00:08:21,475 --> 00:08:23,305
Are we gonna be
okay without dad?

140
00:08:23,307 --> 00:08:25,167
I'm doing
the best I can.

141
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:26,965
It's not easy
for a woman to get a job

142
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:29,085
And to support four kids
on her own.

143
00:08:29,087 --> 00:08:31,139
Look at me,
I'm an ornament.

144
00:08:31,141 --> 00:08:32,648
The only thing
I was ever good at

145
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,772
Was being pretty.

146
00:08:37,756 --> 00:08:40,259
You know...

147
00:08:40,261 --> 00:08:41,800
You're lucky.

148
00:08:41,802 --> 00:08:43,535
You had a dad that
thought you were special.

149
00:08:43,537 --> 00:08:45,621
Because I'm just like you.

150
00:08:45,623 --> 00:08:47,516
Well, in looks, maybe,

151
00:08:47,518 --> 00:08:49,443
But you're more aggressive
and determined.

152
00:08:49,444 --> 00:08:51,145
You're just like his mother,

153
00:08:51,147 --> 00:08:52,974
And he loved
his mother.

154
00:08:52,976 --> 00:08:55,287
Doesn't everyone
love their mother?

155
00:08:55,289 --> 00:08:57,856
Some mothers
are impossible to love.

156
00:08:57,858 --> 00:08:59,943
They don't act like
mothers at all.

157
00:09:03,412 --> 00:09:05,851
Have christopher read
the twins a story,

158
00:09:05,853 --> 00:09:07,328
And put this in
the mailbox for tomorrow.

159
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,351
Another one?
But you already sent--

160
00:09:09,353 --> 00:09:11,118
It's late.
You should finish your homework.

161
00:09:28,908 --> 00:09:32,408
Cathy, christopher!
Come inside, now.

162
00:09:34,335 --> 00:09:36,389
You know
all those letters I sent?

163
00:09:36,391 --> 00:09:38,476
Well, I finally got a response.

164
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:40,435
It's all working out
as I'd hoped.

165
00:09:40,437 --> 00:09:42,104
We can go live with
your grandmother,

166
00:09:42,106 --> 00:09:43,068
In virginia.

167
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,095
What grandmother?

168
00:09:44,097 --> 00:09:45,251
You and dad said

169
00:09:45,253 --> 00:09:46,729
That we never
had any family.

170
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,692
Well...

171
00:09:47,694 --> 00:09:48,945
It's complicated.

172
00:09:48,947 --> 00:09:50,872
My parents and I,
we didn't see eye-to-eye,

173
00:09:50,873 --> 00:09:53,729
So we thought it was best
to keep our distance,

174
00:09:53,731 --> 00:09:55,688
But with your father gone,

175
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,454
This is our best hope
for now.

176
00:09:57,456 --> 00:09:58,931
What about school?

177
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:00,472
And all
of our friends?

178
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,206
My ballet classes?

179
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,582
You two are old enough
to understand,

180
00:10:04,584 --> 00:10:06,574
To help your mother
out of a desperate situation.

181
00:10:06,575 --> 00:10:08,404
But we still
have the house,

182
00:10:08,406 --> 00:10:10,170
And I can get a part-time job,

183
00:10:10,172 --> 00:10:11,390
Cathy can help out more
with the twins.

184
00:10:11,392 --> 00:10:13,060
[corrine sighs]

185
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,651
People have
a way of believing

186
00:10:17,653 --> 00:10:18,872
That nothing bad
can ever happen.

187
00:10:18,874 --> 00:10:20,670
And your father
was doing so well

188
00:10:20,672 --> 00:10:22,886
At his job, so...

189
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,812
We charged
against our future.

190
00:10:24,814 --> 00:10:27,542
What do you mean?

191
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,501
Nothing here
is really ours.

192
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,327
Not the furniture,
the cars, your toys...

193
00:10:32,328 --> 00:10:35,248
N-not even
this necklace.

194
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,918
It's been four months,

195
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,363
And I've been
holding them at bay,

196
00:10:38,365 --> 00:10:40,868
But the bank is gonna
come and take it all away.

197
00:10:40,869 --> 00:10:42,859
Look, I know it sounds scary,

198
00:10:42,861 --> 00:10:45,074
But I've saved the best news
for last.

199
00:10:45,076 --> 00:10:47,451
My family is rich.

200
00:10:47,453 --> 00:10:49,955
Not middle-class rich,
but unbelievably wealthy,

201
00:10:49,957 --> 00:10:52,460
And they have one of the finest
homes in all of virginia,

202
00:10:52,462 --> 00:10:53,648
With servants,

203
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,415
And acres of land,
and their very own lake.

204
00:10:55,417 --> 00:10:57,438
Wait till we tell
everyone at school.

205
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,235
We leave tonight.

206
00:10:59,237 --> 00:11:00,328
Tonight?

207
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,896
It's our only choice.

208
00:11:02,898 --> 00:11:04,052
I know it's hard,

209
00:11:04,054 --> 00:11:05,979
But I promise you,

210
00:11:05,981 --> 00:11:07,199
Whatever you leave behind,

211
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:09,704
I'll buy you a thousand more
in virginia.

212
00:11:09,706 --> 00:11:10,667
You won't miss a thing.

213
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:12,080
Don't worry, mom.

214
00:11:12,082 --> 00:11:13,846
We're dollangangers.

215
00:11:13,848 --> 00:11:16,447
We'll be happy wherever.

216
00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:18,566
I knew I could count
on you, christopher.

217
00:11:27,108 --> 00:11:28,360
And one more thing...

218
00:11:28,362 --> 00:11:30,319
Our name
isn't really dollanganger.

219
00:11:30,321 --> 00:11:32,246
It's foxworth.

[train rumbling over tracks]

[christopher]:
I bet the house is huge.

222
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,874
I mean, you could have
your own dance studio

223
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:44,865
With costumes
and a grand piano.

224
00:11:44,867 --> 00:11:47,178
I wouldn't even
hear you.

225
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,585
You'll be out exploring
the woods and the lake.

226
00:11:49,587 --> 00:11:52,219
Way better
than any boring biology class.

227
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,241
Ma'am?

228
00:11:54,243 --> 00:11:56,007
We'll reach your depot
in a few minutes.

229
00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:57,742
Thank you.

230
00:11:57,743 --> 00:11:59,091
You're sure
you wouldn't rather

231
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,792
Get off
in charlottesville?

232
00:12:00,794 --> 00:12:01,787
It's 3:00 a.M.,

233
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:03,072
In the middle
of nowhere.

234
00:12:03,074 --> 00:12:05,930
Oh, thank you.
We have someone meeting us.

235
00:12:05,932 --> 00:12:08,371
Just the children's bag.

236
00:12:08,373 --> 00:12:10,233
Someone will
pick up mine tomorrow.

237
00:12:11,358 --> 00:12:12,320
Thank you.

238
00:12:15,115 --> 00:12:16,237
Have a good night.

00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:18,357
Godspeed,

I thought you said

242
00:12:31,607 --> 00:12:33,211
There was someone
meeting us.

243
00:12:33,213 --> 00:12:35,202
We should be there
before the sun breaks.

244
00:12:35,204 --> 00:12:37,321
It's a long walk.

245
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:38,573
How long?

246
00:12:38,575 --> 00:12:40,146
I can't carry
the twins.

247
00:12:40,148 --> 00:12:41,239
Well, let them walk.

248

I wanna go back home now!

Just a little further,
and everything will be alright.

You really think so?

Yes. If that's
what mom said.

This is
foxworth hall.

Thank you for
taking us in, mother.

what we would've done.

I'm not your father, corrine.

Your groveling
has always bored me.

I see your children
have inherited your good looks.

I just hope there's
no hidden defect or affliction.

I didn't agree
to run a circus here.

can't share a bed.

are children.

They're innocent.

Yes. That's what
I used to presume about you.

Well, if you're so worried,

276
00:15:54,798 --> 00:15:56,530
Why don't you put them
in a separate room?

277
00:15:56,532 --> 00:15:57,590
Heaven knows
there's enough here.

278
00:15:57,592 --> 00:15:58,714
No, this is the only safe room

279
00:15:58,716 --> 00:16:00,288
Where your father
can't hear them.

280
00:16:01,444 --> 00:16:03,916
Put the two girls in one bed

And the two boys
in the other one.

282
00:16:10,707 --> 00:16:11,900
And when your mother and I
leave here,

283
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,084
I will lock this room
from the outside,

284

And you will
keep the drapes closed.

God sees everything.

you do behind my back.

I'm sorry, I should've
told you the truth,

293

But I didn't want you
to be frightened.

294
00:16:47,935 --> 00:16:51,273
When I was 18, I did something
my parents didn't approve of,

295
00:16:51,275 --> 00:16:53,104
So my father
wrote me out of his will.

296
00:16:53,106 --> 00:16:54,581
Is that why she hates us?

297

She doesn't
hate you.

She's just jealous

Of how much I love
you guys and your dad,

How much my father
used to love me.

That's why we're here.
I'm gonna win him back.

302
00:17:04,794 --> 00:17:06,205
He's gonna put us
in his will.

303
00:17:06,206 --> 00:17:08,613
He's 78 years old
and he's dying,

304
00:17:08,615 --> 00:17:10,668
And I just need a little time
alone to reconnect with him.

305
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:11,825
How much time?

306
00:17:11,827 --> 00:17:12,788
I don't know exactly.

307
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,650
Maybe a few days
or a week?

308
00:17:14,652 --> 00:17:16,609
And when I win my father over,

309
00:17:16,611 --> 00:17:18,504
I'm gonna take you all
down to meet him,

310
00:17:18,506 --> 00:17:20,398
And I know he'll love each
and every one of you

311
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,425
Just as much as I do.

312
00:17:21,427 --> 00:17:22,549
We'll be fine up here.

313

I'll bring toys and games,

And I'll come visit you
as much as I can.

318
00:17:32,924 --> 00:17:34,688
And just whatever you do,

319
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,775
Don't make your grandmother
angry, okay?

Corrine!

321
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,362
What is that
on that child's hand?

322
00:17:42,364 --> 00:17:44,321
It's a promise ring,
from my father.

323
00:17:44,323 --> 00:17:46,536
Give it to me.

324
00:17:46,538 --> 00:17:49,009
Mom, she can't.

325
00:17:49,011 --> 00:17:50,358
Dad gave it to me.

326

I said, give it
to me, girl!

327

Or must I speak
more...

328
00:17:57,681 --> 00:17:59,927
Slowly?

329
00:18:11,968 --> 00:18:14,591
And don't you ever mention
your father in this house again.

330
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,974
[huffs] come on, corrine,
that's enough.

331
00:18:16,976 --> 00:18:18,547
[whispers]: I'm sorry.

332
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:20,539
I promise, all our dreams
are gonna come true.

333
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,626
Just trust me.

334
00:18:22,628 --> 00:18:24,553
[smooch]

335
00:18:24,555 --> 00:18:25,644
[smooch]

336
00:18:58,944 --> 00:19:00,228
[cory]: Where's the sun?

337
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,191
Is it still night?

338
00:19:01,193 --> 00:19:02,122
Cory! Don't.

339
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,728
Your food.

340
00:19:13,298 --> 00:19:15,256
Uh! Uh-uh-uh.
Get your hands off that.

341
00:19:15,258 --> 00:19:17,568
That food has to last you
the entire day.

342
00:19:17,569 --> 00:19:19,526
I can't be running
up and down the stairs.

343
00:19:19,528 --> 00:19:22,512
The servants
might get suspicious.

344
00:19:22,514 --> 00:19:26,173
There'll be eggs for breakfast,
sandwiches for lunch,

345
00:19:26,175 --> 00:19:27,297
And chicken for dinner,

346
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:28,839
And I want you
to eat all of it.

347
00:19:28,841 --> 00:19:31,150
Don't waste one bite of it,
you understand?

348
00:19:32,597 --> 00:19:34,009
And if you're very good,

349
00:19:34,011 --> 00:19:35,935
I may bring you
some fruit.

350
00:19:35,937 --> 00:19:37,091
Thank you.

351
00:19:38,569 --> 00:19:42,389
I've written out
a list of other rules.

352
00:19:42,589 --> 00:19:45,413
First of all, you'll keep
this room neat and tidy,

353
00:19:45,415 --> 00:19:47,501
As if nobody lived here.

354
00:19:47,503 --> 00:19:49,491
Keep your hair brushed neatly,

355
00:19:49,493 --> 00:19:53,377
And your bodies clean
and fully clothed.

356
00:19:53,379 --> 00:19:56,203
And be modest
when you go to the bathroom.

357
00:19:56,204 --> 00:20:00,666
Girls and boys are never to use
the bathroom at the same time.

358
00:20:02,144 --> 00:20:05,129
You older children will
keep the younger ones quiet.

359
00:20:05,131 --> 00:20:07,923
No running around
or yelling or crying,

360
00:20:07,925 --> 00:20:09,850
They're good kids,

361
00:20:09,852 --> 00:20:12,322
But they need somewhere
to play and make noise.

362
00:20:12,324 --> 00:20:15,437
Ah. Over here, there's a...

363
00:20:15,439 --> 00:20:17,107
Stairway.

364
00:20:17,109 --> 00:20:19,258
Leads up to the attic.

365
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,024
You want us
to play in an attic?

366
00:20:21,026 --> 00:20:23,047
Up there,
there will be ample room.

367
00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:26,098
And, the last Friday
of every month,

368
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,571
You're to clean out
all of your things

369
00:20:28,573 --> 00:20:29,823
And hide up there

370
00:20:29,825 --> 00:20:30,979
While the maids
are cleaning this room.

371
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:36,341
No one must ever see
or hear you.

372
00:20:36,343 --> 00:20:38,428
Do you understand?

373
00:20:39,553 --> 00:20:41,350
Good.

374
00:20:41,352 --> 00:20:45,974
Because if your grandfather ever
discovered that you're here,

375
00:20:45,976 --> 00:20:48,897
You'd all be thrown out
without a red cent,

376
00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:52,782
But not before getting punished
for even being alive.

377
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:38,629
Carrie...

378
00:21:38,829 --> 00:21:40,754
You can dress up
for days in here.

379
00:21:40,756 --> 00:21:42,455
Hey, cor',
check it out.

380
00:21:42,457 --> 00:21:44,478
You finally get
your own record player.

381
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,020
But it doesn't
have a plug.

382
00:21:46,022 --> 00:21:47,433
You just have to crank it.

383
00:21:49,199 --> 00:21:51,864
[music begins to crackle]

384
00:21:52,957 --> 00:21:55,685
Better hope you inherit
from this half of the gene pool.

385
00:21:55,687 --> 00:21:58,639
Like you
know anything.

386
00:21:58,641 --> 00:22:01,818
[d]

387
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,713
Our entire family.

388
00:22:03,715 --> 00:22:06,507
They're all grumpy!
Like our grandma.

389
00:22:06,509 --> 00:22:08,530
They're not grumpy.

390
00:22:08,532 --> 00:22:10,488
Guys! You gotta
come check this out.

391
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,736
[d]

392
00:22:16,975 --> 00:22:19,801
Looks we weren't
the first kids up here.

393
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:23,204
[carrie]:
It's hot and dusty.

394
00:22:23,206 --> 00:22:24,618
I don't like it.

395
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:25,773
It's not so bad.

396
00:22:25,775 --> 00:22:27,443
I wanna go outside
in the garden.

397
00:22:27,445 --> 00:22:28,534
This is a bad place.

398
00:22:28,536 --> 00:22:29,658
I want mama!

399
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,388
Okay, we're gonna
make this a game.

400
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,411
Pretend
we're outside.

401
00:22:34,412 --> 00:22:35,631
The floor can
be the garden,

402
00:22:35,633 --> 00:22:37,686
And the ceiling
can be the sky,

403
00:22:37,688 --> 00:22:40,159
And I'll even
make a swing.

404
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:47,127
What do you think
she meant,

405
00:22:47,129 --> 00:22:50,820
Grandfather punishing us
for even being alive?

406
00:22:50,822 --> 00:22:52,136
She's just
trying to scare us.

407
00:22:52,138 --> 00:22:53,934
Then how come she said
we'd be here for months?

408
00:22:53,936 --> 00:22:55,411
Quit worrying.

409
00:22:55,413 --> 00:22:57,338
Mom's gonna take care of us.

410
00:23:06,378 --> 00:23:07,302
Maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

411
00:23:11,082 --> 00:23:12,208
See? It worked.

412
00:23:12,408 --> 00:23:14,687
Cory, carrie,
come try this out.

413
00:23:22,587 --> 00:23:24,738
I'm telling you,
the week's gonna fly by.

414
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:28,207
Mom's gonna win over her dad
and we'll all be rich.

415
00:23:28,209 --> 00:23:31,160
We'll never have to
see this attic again.

416
00:23:33,474 --> 00:23:36,106
This is cold and greasy!
I don't like it.

417
00:23:36,108 --> 00:23:37,968
Cripes, carrie.
This is all we have.

418
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:39,253
No!

419
00:23:39,255 --> 00:23:40,280
I don't
like this either.

420
00:23:40,282 --> 00:23:42,624
Children, enough.

421
00:23:45,483 --> 00:23:47,409
Wasting food...

422
00:23:47,411 --> 00:23:49,624
Is the devil's work.

423
00:23:50,814 --> 00:23:55,437
If you leave so much
as one bite of your food...

424
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:57,042
God will tell me--

425
00:23:57,044 --> 00:23:58,037
[giggling]

426
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:59,354
...And you will be punished

427
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:02,212
And sent
to the bowels of hell!

428
00:24:02,214 --> 00:24:03,850
[laughing]

429
00:24:06,163 --> 00:24:07,639
Mommy!

430
00:24:07,641 --> 00:24:08,602
Oh, mom. Sorry.

431
00:24:08,604 --> 00:24:09,983
We were just
goofing around.

432
00:24:09,985 --> 00:24:12,102
[cathy]: He was trying
to get the twins to eat.

433
00:24:12,104 --> 00:24:13,804
Oh, kids, what did I tell you?

434
00:24:13,806 --> 00:24:15,634
I just, um...

435
00:24:15,636 --> 00:24:17,337
Oh, mother. Um...

436
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:20,484
Don't be mad.
It's not their fault.

437
00:24:20,485 --> 00:24:22,570
They didn't
properly understand.

438
00:24:24,241 --> 00:24:26,135
They will.

439
00:24:39,944 --> 00:24:42,768
[door creaking]

440
00:24:47,554 --> 00:24:49,127
Mom?

441
00:24:49,128 --> 00:24:50,314
You okay?

442
00:24:50,316 --> 00:24:52,980
I just wanted to come
say goodnight.

443
00:24:54,971 --> 00:24:57,989
How was your first day?
It wasn't so bad, was it?

444
00:24:57,991 --> 00:25:00,750
Mommy, we don't
like it here.

445
00:25:00,752 --> 00:25:02,003
It's not nice.

446
00:25:02,005 --> 00:25:03,094
Carrie, stop.

447
00:25:03,096 --> 00:25:05,984
No. Cathy and christopher
are mean.

448
00:25:05,986 --> 00:25:07,622
We wanna go home.

449
00:25:07,624 --> 00:25:08,617
[cory]:
With you, mama.

450
00:25:08,619 --> 00:25:09,613
We want you.

451
00:25:09,615 --> 00:25:11,540
I'm sorry, darlings,

452
00:25:11,542 --> 00:25:14,205
It's just, for now,

453
00:25:14,207 --> 00:25:16,196
You have to listen to
your older brother and sister,

454
00:25:16,198 --> 00:25:17,352
Like they're parents.

455
00:25:17,354 --> 00:25:18,347
No!

456
00:25:18,349 --> 00:25:21,205
Take us out of here. Now!

457
00:25:21,207 --> 00:25:22,939
Corrine!

458
00:25:22,941 --> 00:25:25,765
Stop that child from screaming
right now.

459
00:25:25,767 --> 00:25:27,081
[shrieks]

460
00:25:28,752 --> 00:25:29,907
Ow! Get away from me!

461
00:25:29,909 --> 00:25:31,834
Get! Get off!

462
00:25:31,835 --> 00:25:33,760
Stop yelling!
They're only five.

463
00:25:33,762 --> 00:25:35,302
Take off your blouse
and show them

464
00:25:35,304 --> 00:25:37,325
How bad behavior is
dealt with in this house.

465
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,220
You can do whatever
you want to me,

466
00:25:39,222 --> 00:25:40,600
But you can't be
cruel to my children,

467
00:25:40,602 --> 00:25:42,206
Or we'll leave tonight,

468
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,196
And you'll never see them,
or me, ever again.

469
00:25:44,198 --> 00:25:46,059
[chuckles dryly]

470
00:25:46,061 --> 00:25:48,018
Go!

471
00:25:52,739 --> 00:25:54,665
[grandmother resumes chuckling]

472
00:25:56,881 --> 00:25:59,609
Now take off
your blouse.

473
00:26:00,671 --> 00:26:02,597
[roars]: Do it!

474
00:26:05,584 --> 00:26:09,147
Take a good long look, children,

475
00:26:09,148 --> 00:26:12,422
At what happens
when you disobey me.

476
00:26:12,424 --> 00:26:14,285
18 lashes,

477
00:26:14,287 --> 00:26:17,110
For every year she used
her wicked charms

478
00:26:17,112 --> 00:26:18,780
On my husband!

479
00:26:18,782 --> 00:26:21,092
And 20 more

480
00:26:21,094 --> 00:26:24,560
For every year she lived in sin
with your father.

481
00:26:24,562 --> 00:26:26,486
A marriage
that was an abomination

482
00:26:26,488 --> 00:26:28,509
In the eyes of the lord,

483
00:26:28,511 --> 00:26:30,469
With four children

484
00:26:30,471 --> 00:26:32,170
Spawned by the devil!

485
00:26:32,172 --> 00:26:34,258
Evil...

486
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,244
From the moment
you were conceived.

487
00:26:37,246 --> 00:26:39,139
Evil!

488
00:26:42,383 --> 00:26:45,015
I make the rules
in this house.

489
00:26:46,673 --> 00:26:47,832
I do!

490
00:26:50,434 --> 00:26:51,651
And I execute the punishment.

491
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:08,352
[door creaks]

492
00:27:12,103 --> 00:27:13,329
Figured since I couldn't
get you a real garden,

493
00:27:13,529 --> 00:27:15,742
That you could build
a garden in the attic.

494
00:27:15,744 --> 00:27:16,737
What about
grandmother?

495
00:27:16,739 --> 00:27:18,183
Won't she punish us?

496
00:27:18,185 --> 00:27:20,527
She's claustrophobic.

497
00:27:20,529 --> 00:27:22,743
She'll never
climb the stairs.

498
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:25,430
[exhales sharply]

499
00:27:26,032 --> 00:27:27,314
You should take it easy. Mom.

500
00:27:27,514 --> 00:27:28,797
It's okay.

501
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,274
It's just
a willow switching.

502
00:27:30,275 --> 00:27:32,971
My pride hurts
worse than my back.

503
00:27:32,973 --> 00:27:35,315
But why?

504
00:27:35,317 --> 00:27:37,917
Why did grandmother say
those things about daddy?

505
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,490
About us?

506
00:27:41,065 --> 00:27:42,733
When I was little,

507
00:27:42,735 --> 00:27:44,884
I turned to
my father for love.

508
00:27:44,886 --> 00:27:46,554
We did everything
together.

509
00:27:46,556 --> 00:27:48,738
Sailing
and horseback-riding,

510
00:27:48,739 --> 00:27:50,664
Even hunting.

511
00:27:50,666 --> 00:27:54,357
That only made my mother
more jealous.

512
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:56,316
And she took every
opportunity she could

513
00:27:56,318 --> 00:27:58,147
To torment me
and shame me,

514
00:27:58,149 --> 00:27:59,624
And she succeeded.

515
00:27:59,626 --> 00:28:00,972
Over the years,

516
00:28:00,974 --> 00:28:02,096
My father became more
and more busy with work,

517
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:03,990
And I became

518
00:28:03,992 --> 00:28:06,013
More withdrawn
and lonely.

519
00:28:06,015 --> 00:28:10,574
And into all this came
my father's half-brother.

520
00:28:10,576 --> 00:28:13,688
His mother had recently died
and my family took him in.

521
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:16,450
He was only
a few years older than me.

522
00:28:16,452 --> 00:28:21,106
He was so handsome
and so kind, and, uh...

523
00:28:21,108 --> 00:28:22,390
So full of life.

524
00:28:22,392 --> 00:28:23,835
[sad chuckle]

525
00:28:23,837 --> 00:28:26,372
My father treated him
like he was his own son,

526
00:28:26,374 --> 00:28:28,299
And I'd never met
anyone like him.

527
00:28:31,478 --> 00:28:32,698
[sighs]

528
00:28:32,699 --> 00:28:35,684
You're talking about dad?

529
00:28:39,475 --> 00:28:41,624
We tried to keep
our feelings secret,

530
00:28:41,626 --> 00:28:43,616
Even from each other.

531
00:28:43,618 --> 00:28:45,574
I mean, we were
related by blood.

532
00:28:45,576 --> 00:28:46,602
He was my half-uncle.

533
00:28:46,604 --> 00:28:48,368
And when we eloped,

534
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:51,387
My family flew into a rage
and my father disinherited me,

535
00:28:51,389 --> 00:28:52,928
And my mother said

536
00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:54,887
That my children would be
born with hooved feet

537
00:28:54,889 --> 00:28:56,814
And forked tails.

538
00:28:56,815 --> 00:28:58,900
She was wrong.

539
00:28:58,902 --> 00:29:00,859
God didn't punish me,
not with you.

540
00:29:00,861 --> 00:29:02,818
You are perfect.

541
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,419
You have to believe it,
no matter what anyone says.

542
00:29:05,421 --> 00:29:06,800
I hope you can understand

543
00:29:06,802 --> 00:29:10,653
That love doesn't always come
when you want it.

544
00:29:10,655 --> 00:29:14,474
Sometimes it just happens,
against your will.

545
00:29:16,209 --> 00:29:19,130
I don't care what you did, mom,
or do.

546
00:29:20,608 --> 00:29:22,084
I'll always love you.

547
00:29:25,489 --> 00:29:28,443
Why did grandmother
let you come back?

548
00:29:28,445 --> 00:29:29,727
Because she's been
waiting 20 years

549
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,590
To say
"I told you so."

550
00:29:31,592 --> 00:29:33,548
Trust me, cathy,

551
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:36,534
I'm as much a captive
of this place as you are.

552
00:29:43,761 --> 00:29:45,140
Hey, cor'.

553
00:29:45,142 --> 00:29:46,617
That's a great...

554
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:48,063
It's a snail.

555
00:29:48,065 --> 00:29:50,407
I can't wait to show it
to mama when she comes.

556
00:29:51,884 --> 00:29:53,617
If she comes.

557
00:29:53,619 --> 00:29:54,967
She's only missed
a few days.

558
00:29:54,969 --> 00:29:55,897
A week.

559
00:29:55,899 --> 00:29:57,696
I've made a calendar.

560
00:30:09,449 --> 00:30:12,178
You gonna help out
with the garden or what?

561
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,843
We need water.

562
00:30:20,367 --> 00:30:22,903
Watch where you're going!

563
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:25,247
Why are you
in such a hurry?

564
00:30:25,249 --> 00:30:27,591
Sorry, I-I just had to
get some more water

565
00:30:27,593 --> 00:30:29,678
For christopher
before the paint dries.

566
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,930
The paint?

567
00:30:30,932 --> 00:30:32,408
We're building
a garden,

568
00:30:32,409 --> 00:30:33,467
In the attic,

569
00:30:33,469 --> 00:30:35,427
So the twins
won't be so scared.

570
00:30:35,428 --> 00:30:37,160
Was this
your mother's idea?

571
00:30:38,285 --> 00:30:41,463
Hope you didn't inherit
her artistic abilities.

572
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:45,702
The only real talent
corrine ever had was...

573
00:30:45,704 --> 00:30:48,303
For the opposite sex.

574
00:30:49,621 --> 00:30:52,606
I'm a dancer, actually.
Ballet.

575
00:30:52,608 --> 00:30:54,532
And christopher's
a really good artist.

576
00:30:54,534 --> 00:30:55,688
He can paint anything.

577
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,840
Has he ever
painted you?

578
00:30:59,511 --> 00:31:01,180
Has he asked you
to pose for him

579
00:31:01,181 --> 00:31:02,785
With your clothes off?

580
00:31:02,787 --> 00:31:04,647
Come on, girl!

581
00:31:04,649 --> 00:31:06,124
Spill out the truth!

582
00:31:06,126 --> 00:31:08,180
I want to know what kind of
wickedness you're up to!

583
00:31:08,182 --> 00:31:10,074
Nothing.

584
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:11,776
Nothing?

585
00:31:11,778 --> 00:31:13,413
Why are you trembling?

586
00:31:13,415 --> 00:31:16,240
Because you keep accusing us
of doing all these bad things,

587
00:31:16,242 --> 00:31:18,583
And I don't even know
what you're talking about.

588
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,156
[scoffs bitterly]

589
00:31:20,158 --> 00:31:21,987
You don't know
what I'm talking about.

590
00:31:21,989 --> 00:31:24,427
Ask your brother!

591
00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:27,349
He'll know.

592
00:31:27,351 --> 00:31:28,410
By the time they're born,

593
00:31:28,412 --> 00:31:30,657
The male of the species

594
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:33,996
They know all about
wickedness...

595
00:31:35,443 --> 00:31:37,337
Evil.

596
00:31:43,149 --> 00:31:45,685
Right. Now, make sure
that you take all of your toys.

597
00:31:45,687 --> 00:31:47,644
Check under the beds.
Make sure.

598
00:31:47,646 --> 00:31:49,474
I don't want
any trace of you here.

599
00:31:49,476 --> 00:31:51,818
Why don't you take this?

600
00:31:54,678 --> 00:31:56,346
Why does this table
look polished?

601
00:31:56,348 --> 00:32:00,810
The room can't look
like it's just been dusted!

602
00:32:00,812 --> 00:32:03,347
The maids are gonna be here
in less than an hour.

603
00:32:03,349 --> 00:32:05,980
Alright, never mind.
I'll take care of it.

604
00:32:05,982 --> 00:32:07,713
Uh--

605
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:13,622
Here are some real flowers
for your fake garden.

606
00:32:15,577 --> 00:32:16,410
Just go.

607
00:32:29,295 --> 00:32:30,196
"see jane run.

608
00:32:31,198 --> 00:32:32,057
Run, jane, run."

609
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:34,163
Now you try.

610
00:32:34,363 --> 00:32:35,741
No!

611
00:32:35,743 --> 00:32:38,631
We've already read it
a kazillion times.

612
00:32:38,633 --> 00:32:40,815
[cathy]: If you guys
play nicely tonight,

613
00:32:40,817 --> 00:32:42,806
We can go on the roof
tomorrow morning.

614
00:32:42,808 --> 00:32:44,348
[cory]:
I don't wanna go on the roof.

615
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,664
Mom!

616
00:32:45,666 --> 00:32:48,425
We missed you so much!

617
00:32:48,427 --> 00:32:51,091
I'm sorry I've kept you
waiting so long, darlings,

618
00:32:51,093 --> 00:32:52,824
But here's some games,

619
00:32:52,826 --> 00:32:54,591
And the paints
you asked for, cathy.

620
00:32:54,593 --> 00:32:55,971
Where have you been?

621
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:58,798
I wanted
to come earlier, but...

622
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,045
I've had to spend every moment
with my father.

623
00:33:01,047 --> 00:33:03,293
You have no idea
how hard it's been on me.

624
00:33:03,295 --> 00:33:04,674
Today, I finally

625
00:33:04,676 --> 00:33:05,894
Just had a chance
to go sailing on the lake.

626
00:33:05,896 --> 00:33:07,531
You went sailing?

627
00:33:07,533 --> 00:33:09,426
You got some great
color, mom.

628
00:33:09,626 --> 00:33:11,519
Can you stay for
the twins' bedtime?

629
00:33:11,521 --> 00:33:13,606
[twins cheering]:
Yeah! Stay! Stay!

630
00:33:13,608 --> 00:33:16,368
I have a movie date
with an old friend.

631
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:17,428
She keeps
asking me out

632
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:20,350
But I would much rather
be with you guys!

633
00:33:20,351 --> 00:33:23,304
Then why aren't you downstairs
telling your father about us?

634
00:33:23,306 --> 00:33:25,166
Well, cathy, I have to time it
very carefully.

635
00:33:25,168 --> 00:33:26,161
I only just got back.

636
00:33:26,163 --> 00:33:27,542
It's been a month!

637
00:33:30,267 --> 00:33:31,053
And I'm sick of
being in here.

638
00:33:31,253 --> 00:33:34,531
The twins need
fresh air and sunshine.

639
00:33:34,731 --> 00:33:37,040
I want to go sailing!

640
00:33:37,042 --> 00:33:38,453
Stop picking
on mom, cathy.

641
00:33:38,455 --> 00:33:40,187
I just want to know when.

642
00:33:40,189 --> 00:33:42,210
When are you going to tell
your father about us?

643
00:33:42,212 --> 00:33:43,976
When do we get to leave?

644
00:33:43,978 --> 00:33:45,196
Like I said,

645
00:33:45,198 --> 00:33:46,995
My father has just
finally accepted me back.

646
00:33:46,997 --> 00:33:49,467
Then why can't he accept us?

647
00:33:49,469 --> 00:33:53,481
Are we so terrible,
or stupid, or ugly,

648
00:33:53,483 --> 00:33:56,564
That he wouldn't want to meet
his own grandchildren?

649
00:33:58,395 --> 00:34:00,545
I can't.

650
00:34:02,506 --> 00:34:04,945
I can't tell him
about you, ever.

651
00:34:04,947 --> 00:34:07,225
My father forgave me
on one condition--

652
00:34:07,227 --> 00:34:10,308
That I didn't have any children
with your father.

653
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,858
You know what?

654
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,046
I'll cancel
my movie date,

655
00:34:16,352 --> 00:34:18,966
And I'll stay here
with you and the twins.

656
00:34:19,166 --> 00:34:21,091
It's okay, mom.

657
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:23,981
You go.

any day now.

That's how
heart disease works.

661
00:34:47,616 --> 00:34:49,509
A blood clot
could break free

662
00:34:49,511 --> 00:34:51,692
And find its way
to his lungs or heart,

663
00:34:51,694 --> 00:34:53,587
Snuff him out
like a candle.

With our luck,
grandfather will never die.

We'll be stuck
up here forever.

A month, even?

Pretty soon,

We're gonna be
worth millions.

How she's always
in a new outfit?

She's a foxworth.

She has to fit in
around here.

he used to take us sledding

He was always
running alongside us,

Making sure
the twins were safe.

One christmas
up here won't matter.

And we can make our own
presents for the twins.

We could make something
for grandmother, too.

700

She does bring us
food every day.

701
00:37:36,115 --> 00:37:38,072
She got us that plant.

would look perfect on you.

He's my father's attorney.

He says it's only a matter

in all this time...

I don't deserve that.

It belonged to my mother.

Passed on
from her own mother.

Maybe someday you'll have

Well, I'm far from perfect.

No one heard us,

Not for any reason!

How can you say that?

You can't keep us

Are you with him?

And he's helping us.

feel so much pride

But the twins...
They didn't do anything.

I think
it'll be your brother

Who will cut off
your precious hair.

972
00:52:16,352 --> 00:52:18,856
Or none of you will eat at all.

973
00:52:28,554 --> 00:52:30,255
I'm still hungry.

She can't control us.
We can't let her.

Yeah. Uh...

Brothers don't think
of their sisters that way.

1002

No way.

I need a dance partner

It's not my fault
you outgrew it.

You're outgrowing
a lot of things.

00:56:34,971 --> 00:56:37,153
When are we gonna
outgrow things?

No! I don't
want to go outside!

You guys need fresh air

It's for

01:15:20,684 --> 01:15:22,042
Cory had pneumonia.

1301
01:15:22,142 --> 01:15:23,510
The doctors did
all they could, but...

1302
01:15:23,812 --> 01:15:28,968
It was too late.

1303
01:15:35,577 --> 01:15:36,423
Will there be
a funeral?

1304
01:15:38,523 --> 01:15:39,671
He's already been buried.

1305
01:16:05,554 --> 01:16:06,612
I'm sorry.

1306
01:16:06,712 --> 01:16:07,405
[bawling continues]

1307
01:16:17,611 --> 01:16:19,248
[cathy]: Carrie?

1308
01:16:19,448 --> 01:16:20,989
Cathy.

1309
01:16:22,089 --> 01:16:23,979
Just let her be.

1310
01:16:30,765 --> 01:16:31,429
We need to run away.

1311
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:34,132
Or else we're all
gonna die like cory.

1312
01:16:34,134 --> 01:16:35,384
Do we have
enough money?

1313
01:16:35,386 --> 01:16:36,508
We'll go tonight.

1314
01:16:36,510 --> 01:16:38,531
Take everything we can.
Money, jewelry.

1315
01:16:38,533 --> 01:16:41,880
Everything.

1316
01:17:14,376 --> 01:17:18,257
She's not coming back
Is she?

1317
01:17:20,157 --> 01:17:21,760
She's dead to us now.

1318
01:17:26,908 --> 01:17:27,967
When do we tell her?

1319
01:17:27,969 --> 01:17:29,540
After breakfast.

1320
01:17:29,542 --> 01:17:30,889
I don't want her
getting scared.

1321
01:17:30,891 --> 01:17:32,783
More than she has to be.

1322
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:35,655
So we just walk right
out the front door?

1323
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:38,177
We wait till dinner,

1324
01:17:38,179 --> 01:17:39,333
When all the servants and family

1325
01:17:39,335 --> 01:17:40,874
Are in the kitchen
or dining room.

1326
01:17:40,876 --> 01:17:41,902
So carrie and I will
go to the fence

1327
01:17:41,904 --> 01:17:43,058
And you'll go to the shed

1328
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:43,989
So you can turn off
the electricity?

1329
01:17:43,991 --> 01:17:45,338
Then we catch up
by the lake

1330
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:47,264
And head to the depot
for the evening train.

1331
01:17:47,266 --> 01:17:49,512
And by the time
grandmother comes in

1332
01:17:49,514 --> 01:17:50,636
With our breakfast
tomorrow,

1333
01:17:50,638 --> 01:17:52,499
We'll be halfway
to florida.

1334
01:17:52,699 --> 01:17:56,496
I was thinking,
I can sell my ring.

1335
01:17:59,026 --> 01:17:59,896
It's okay.

1336
01:17:59,996 --> 01:18:00,822
It's what
dad would've wanted.

1337
01:18:00,824 --> 01:18:03,510
You're keeping that ring.

1338
01:18:03,610 --> 01:18:04,429
Forever.

1339
01:18:34,598 --> 01:18:37,423
I'm telling you,
I did hear someone.

1340
01:18:37,425 --> 01:18:39,060
Must be those mice.
They make an awful racket.

1341
01:18:39,062 --> 01:18:40,698
You can hear them
all the way up in the attic.

1342
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:42,978
Mrs. Foxworth carries
enough poison up there

1343
01:18:42,980 --> 01:18:44,455
To kill
a german army of 'em.

1344
01:18:44,457 --> 01:18:47,184
Do you think miss corrine
will sell the place?

1345
01:18:47,186 --> 01:18:50,106
I doubt she'll be
making any hasty decisions.

1346
01:18:50,108 --> 01:18:51,583
Hasty? It's been
seven months

1347
01:18:51,585 --> 01:18:53,221
Since mr. Foxworth died.

1348
01:18:53,223 --> 01:18:54,795
Well, never mind that.

1349
01:18:54,797 --> 01:18:57,716
All you maids will be
losing your job soon enough

1350
01:18:57,718 --> 01:18:59,868
If you don't
mind the silver.

1351
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:02,700
[footfalls receding]

1352
01:19:07,622 --> 01:19:08,709
Carrie, you gotta
eat something.

1353
01:19:08,809 --> 01:19:10,310
You have to be strong,
for later.

1354
01:19:10,312 --> 01:19:13,041
No. Don't feel well.

1355
01:19:13,141 --> 01:19:15,720
I have to
take care of mickey.

1356
01:19:18,163 --> 01:19:18,842
Where'd you get that?

1357
01:19:18,942 --> 01:19:20,633
I saved it for cory,

1358
01:19:20,733 --> 01:19:23,495
For when he came back
from the hospital.

1359
01:19:59,473 --> 01:20:02,330
Cathy, we need to
leave right now.

1360

[sniffling]

1361
01:20:05,383 --> 01:20:07,435
It's mickey.

1362
01:20:07,437 --> 01:20:10,325
Carrie gave him
one of cory's donuts

1363
01:20:10,327 --> 01:20:12,317
And he just started
whimpering all of a sudden--

1364
01:20:12,318 --> 01:20:15,175
No. No.
That can't be right.

1365
01:20:15,177 --> 01:20:16,716
What?

1366
01:20:16,717 --> 01:20:18,675
The powdered sugar
on the donuts,

1367
01:20:18,677 --> 01:20:20,216
I think
there was poison in it.

1368
01:20:20,218 --> 01:20:21,597
That's why we're sick.

1369
01:20:21,797 --> 01:20:23,625
Are you saying that
our grandmother

1370
01:20:23,627 --> 01:20:26,153
Tried to kill us?

1371
01:20:28,873 --> 01:20:31,192
You have a key.

No.

leave this room!

[scoffing]
you're gonna hit me?

give me that key,
