00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,349
Well, I finally got a response.

161
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,052
It's all working out
as I'd hoped.

162
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,815
We can go live with
your grandmother...

163
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:11,876
In Virginia.

164
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:13,185
What grandmother?

165
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:14,245
You and dad said...

166
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,850
That we never
had any family.

167
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,952
Well...
It's complicated.

168

My parents and I,
we didn't see eye-to-eye...

169
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,898
So we thought it was best
to keep our distance...

170
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,959
But with your father gone...

171
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,833
This is our best hope
for now.

172
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:28,371
What about school?

173
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,902
And all
of our friends?

174
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,374
And my ballet classes?

175
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,202
You two are old enough
to understand...

176
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,371
To help your mother
out of a desperate situation.

177
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,240
But we still
have the house...

178
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,977
And I can get
a part-time job...

179
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,746
Cathy can help out more
with the twins.

183

00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,884
What is that
on that child's hand?

319
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,285
It's a promise ring,
from my father.

320
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:38,684
Give it to me.

321
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:41,293
Mom, she can't.

322
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:42,457
Dad gave it to me.

323
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:43,864
I said, give it
to me, girl!

324
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:50,332
Or must I speak more...

325
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,602
Slowly?

326
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:05,384
And don't you ever mention
your father in this house again.

327
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:09,749
Come on, corrine,
that's enough.

328
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:11,590
I'm sorry.

329
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,687
I promise, all our dreams
are going to come true.

330
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,289
Just trust me.

331
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,269
<font color="#804040">CORY</font>:
Where's the sun?

332
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:55,396
Is it still night?

333
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,598
Cory! Don't.

334
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,681
Your food.

335
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:10,214
Uh! Uh-uh-uh.
Get your hands off that.

336
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:12,619
That food has to last you
the entire day.

337
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:15,522
I can't be running
up and down the stairs.

338
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,857
The servants
might get suspicious.

339
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:21,659
There'll be eggs for breakfast,
sandwiches for lunch...

340
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,892
And chicken for dinner...

341
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,491
And I want you
to eat all of it.

342
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,366
Don't waste one bite of it,
you understand?

343
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,766
And if you're very good...

344
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:31,808
I may bring you
some fruit.

345
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,000
Thank you.

346
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:38,437
I've written out
a list of other rules.

347
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:41,643
First of all, you'll keep
this room neat and tidy...

348
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:43,584
As if nobody lived here.

349
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,849
Keep your hair
brushed neatly...

350
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:49,620
And your bodies clean
and fully clothed.

351
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:52,594
And be modest
when you go to the bathroom.

352
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:57,792
Girls and boys are never to use
the bathroom at the same time.

353
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:01,934
You older children will
keep the younger ones quiet.

354
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,838
No running around
or yelling or crying.

355
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:06,773
They're good kids...

356
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:09,574
But they need somewhere
to play and make noise.

357
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:12,377
Ah. Over here, there's a...

358
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,940
Stairway.

359
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,577
Leads up to the attic.

360
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:18,622
You want us
to play in an attic?

361
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:21,487
Up there,
there will be ample room.

362
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:23,890
And, the last Friday
of every month...

363
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,986
You're to clean out
all of your things...

364
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:27,325
And hide up there...

365
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:28,906
While the maids
are cleaning this room.

366
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:35,368
No one must ever see
or hear you.

367
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:36,599
Do you understand?

368
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:40,566
Good. Because
if your grandfather...

369
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:44,011
Ever discovered
that you're here...

370
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:47,050
You'd all be thrown out
without a red cent...

371
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:51,482
But not before getting punished
for even being alive.

372
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:41,530
Carrie...

373
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:43,095
You can dress up
for days in here.

374
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,602
Hey, cor',
check it out.

375
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,734
You finally get
your own record player.

376
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,641
But it doesn't
have a plug.

377
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,008
You just have to crank it.

383
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:11,692
They're not grumpy.

to come check this out.

I don't like it.

388
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:29,607
It's not so bad.

389
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:31,416
I want to go outside
in the garden.

390

I want mama!

392

Okay, we're going
to make this a game.

393
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,552
Pretend we're outside.

394
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,493
The floor can
be the garden...

395
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:42,691
And the ceiling
can be the sky...

396
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,700
And I'll even
make a swing.

397
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:52,973
What do you think
she meant...

398
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:55,672
Grandfather punishing us
for even being alive?

399
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:57,111
She's just
trying to scare us.

400
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:59,581
Then how come she said
we'd be here for months?

401
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:00,173
Quit worrying.

402
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,077

see this attic again.

Is the devil's work.

00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:46,670
With four children
spawned by the devil!

478
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:49,268
Evil...

479
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,008
From the moment
you were conceived.

480
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,146
Evil!

481
00:27:57,709 --> 00:28:00,053
I make the rules
in this house.

482
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:01,749
I do!

483
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:06,187
And I execute the punishment.

484
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,741
Figured since I couldn't
get you a real garden...

485
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:31,845
That you could build
a garden in the attic.

486
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,184
What about
grandmother?

487
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:35,190
Won't she punish us?

488
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:36,384
She's claustrophobic.

489
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:38,428
She'll never
climb the stairs.

490
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:43,061
<font color="#808080">(EXHALES SHARPLY)</font>

491
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:44,361
You should take it easy. Mom.

492
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:45,833
It's okay.

493
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,267
It's just
a willow switching.

494
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:51,000
My pride hurts
worse than my back.

495
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,473
But why?

496
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,507
Why did grandmother say
those things about daddy?

497
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:56,939
About us?

498
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:00,448
When I was little...

499
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:02,883
I turned to
my father for love.

500
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:04,921
We did everything
together.

501
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:07,354
Sailing
and horseback-riding...

502
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,789
Even hunting.

503
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:12,326
That only made my mother
more jealous.

504
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:14,363
And she took every
opportunity she could...

505
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:17,058
To torment me
and shame me...

506
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:18,032
And she succeeded.

507
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,091
Over the years, my father
became more and more busy...

508
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:22,468
With work, and I became...

509
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:24,336
More withdrawn
and lonely.

510
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:29,811
And into all this came
my father's half-brother.

511
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:33,145
His mother had recently died
and my family took him in.

512
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:35,241
He was only
a few years older than me.

513
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:40,187
But he was so handsome
and so kind, and, uh...

514
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:41,781
So full of life.

515
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:43,121
<font color="#808080">(SAD CHUCKLE)</font>

516
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,923
My father treated him
like he was his own son...

517
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:47,861
And I'd never met
anyone like him.

518
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:52,156
<i><font color="#808080">(SIGHS)</font></i>

519
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:55,269
You're talking about dad?

520
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:02,107
We tried to keep
our feelings secret...

521
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:03,544
Even from each other.

522
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,304
I mean, we were
related by blood.

523
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:06,974
He was my half-Uncle.

524
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:08,244
And when we eloped...

525
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:11,810
My family flew into a rage
and my father disinherited me

526
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:12,876
and my mother said...

527
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:15,357
That my children would be
born with hooved feet...

528
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:17,051
And forked tails.

529
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:19,493
She was wrong.

530
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:21,087
God didn't punish me,
not with you.

531
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,359
You are perfect.

532
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:26,265
You have to believe it,
no matter what anyone says.

533
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,530
I hope you
can understand...

534
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:32,507
That love doesn't always come
when you want it.

535
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:36,068
Sometimes it just happens,
against your will.

536
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,847
I don't care what you did,
mom, or do.

537
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,514
I'll always love you.

538
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:50,048
Why did grandmother
let you come back?

539
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,055
Because she's been
waiting 20 years...

540
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:53,254
To say
"I told you so."

541
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,464
Trust me, Cathy...

542
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,399
I'm as much a captive
of this place as you are.

543
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:07,370
Hey, cor'.

544
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:08,911
That's a great...

545
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:10,173
It's a snail.

546
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:13,273
I can't wait to show it
to mama when she comes.

547
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:16,173
If she comes.

548
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:17,585
She's only missed
a few days.

549
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:19,280
A week.

550
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,516
I've made a calendar.

551
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:35,504
You going to help out
with the garden or what?

552
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,062
We need water.

553
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:47,143
Watch where you're going!

554
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:49,383
Why are you
in such a hurry?

555
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,920
Sorry, I-i just had to
get some more water

556
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:53,684
for Christopher
before the paint dries.

557
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,322
The paint?

558
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,053
We're building
a garden...

559
00:31:57,115 --> 00:32:00,153
In the attic so the twins
won't be so scared.

560
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:01,526
Was this
your mother's idea?

561
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:06,933
Hope you didn't inherit
her artistic abilities.

562
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:11,064
The only real talent
corrine ever had was...

563
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:13,166
For the opposite sex.

564
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:17,943
I'm a dancer, actually.
Ballet.

565
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:20,073
And Christopher's
a really good artist.

566
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,208
He can paint anything.

567
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,047
Has he ever
painted you?

568
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:26,656
Has he asked you
to pose for him...

569
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:29,089
With your clothes off?

570
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:30,147
Come on, girl!

571
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:31,252
Spit out the truth!

572
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:33,728
I want to know what kind
of wickedness you're up to!

573
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:35,657
Nothing.

574
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:37,699
Nothing?

575
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:38,991
Why are you trembling?

576
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:42,231
Because you keep accusing us
of doing all these bad things

577
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,295
and I don't even know
what you're talking about.

578
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:48,504
Yeah, you don't know
what I'm talking about.

579
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:51,371
Ask your brother!

580
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:53,677
He'll know.

581
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:55,046
By the time they're born...

582
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:57,382
The male of the species...

583
00:32:57,442 --> 00:33:01,185
They know all about
wickedness and...

584
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,682
Evil.

585
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,562
Right. Now, make sure
that you take all of your toys.

586
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:14,603
Check under the beds
to make sure.

587
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,639
I don't want
any trace of you here.

588
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:18,537
Why don't you take this?

589
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:23,643
Why does this table
look polished?

590
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:25,578
I wiped off
our fingerprints.

591
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:28,617
The room can't look
like it's just been dusted!

592
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:31,017
The maids are going to be here
in less than an hour.

593
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:34,082
All right, never mind.
I'll take care of it.

594
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:35,647
Uh...

595
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:42,422
here are some real flowers
for your fake garden.

596
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:46,564
Just go.

597
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:01,617
"See Jane run.

598
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:04,414
Run, Jane, run."

599
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:06,182
Now you try.

600
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:07,052
No!

601
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:10,786
We've already read it
a gazillion times.

609
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:27,140
And the paints
you asked for, Cathy.

610

Where have you been?

611
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:31,773
I wanted
to come earlier, but...

612
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:34,180
I've had to spend every moment
with my father.

613

You have no idea
how hard it's been on me.

614
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,681
Today, I finally
just had a chance...

615
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:38,812
To go sailing on the lake.

616
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,079
You went sailing?

617
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:43,216
You got some great
color, mom.

618
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,125
Can you stay for
the twins' bedtime?

619
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:48,289

620

621
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:51,489
She keeps

And I can't
keep refusing.

623
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,637
But I would much rather
be with you guys!

624
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:58,139
Then why aren't you downstairs
telling your father about us?

625
00:34:58,196 --> 00:34:59,800
Well, Cathy, I have to time it
very carefully.

626
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:00,706
I only just got back.

627

It's been a month!

And I'm sick
of being in here.

629

The twins need
fresh air and sunshine.

630
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:09,812
I want to go sailing!

631
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:11,683
Stop picking
on mom, Cathy.

632
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:13,449
I just want to know when.

633
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:15,582
When are you going to tell
your father about us?

634

When do we get to leave?

635
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:18,783

00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:23,661
Then why can't he accept us?

638
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:26,702
Are we so terrible,
or stupid, or ugly...

639
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:29,795
That he wouldn't want to meet
his own grandchildren?

640
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,600
I can't.

641
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,204
I can't tell him
about you, ever.

642
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,807
My father forgave me
on one condition...

643
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,513
That I didn't have any children
with your father.

644
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,286
You know what?

645
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:52,623
I'll cancel
my movie date...

646
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:55,186
And I'll stay here
with you and the twins.

647
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:56,698
It's okay, mom.

648
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,559
You go.

649
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:03,299
We'll be fine here.

650
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:22,850
He could go
any day now.

651
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:25,360
That's how
heart disease works.

652
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:26,861
A blood clot
could break free...

653
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:29,763
And find it's way
to his lungs or heart...

654
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,924
Snuff him out
like a candle.

655
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,635
With our luck,
grandfather will never die.

656
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:34,965
We'll be stuck
up here forever.

657
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:38,400
What's few more weeks?
A month, even?

658

Pretty soon, we're going
to be worth millions.

659

Mom already acts
like she is.

660
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:43,509
Have you noticed...

661
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:45,275
How she's always
in a new outfit?

662
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:46,371
She's a foxworth.

663
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:48,542

around here.

664

playing hide-and-seek.

Over here.

671
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,418

672
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:32,325

Making sure
the twins were safe.

One Christmas
up here won't matter.

And we can make our own

Say it's from Santa.

We could make something
for grandmother, too.

She does bring us
food every day.

689

She got us that plant.

She's going to
be here.

I don't want it to rip.

And all the doors and windows
really work...

702
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,700
And the locks.

703

I knew that color
would look perfect on you.

704

one more trick up my sleeve.

Has an even bigger

Who's Mr. winslow?

He's my father's attorney.

720

He says it's only a matter...

Of drawing up
the new paperwork, but...
