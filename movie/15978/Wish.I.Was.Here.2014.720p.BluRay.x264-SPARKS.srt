1
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,639
When I was a kid,
my brother and I used to

2
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,031
pretend we were heroes with swords.

3
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,743
We were the only ones
who could save the day.

4
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,945
But perhaps we set
the bar a little bit high.

5
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,466
Maybe we're just regular people.

6
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,519
The ones who get saved.

7
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,791
Dad?

8
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,985
What's your password?

9
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,559
What?

10
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,510
I said, what's your password?

11
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,399
Dad!

12
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,399
I have no fucking idea!

13
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,719
Swear jar.

14
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,039
Fuck the swear jar.

15
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,319
- Aidan.
- I'm sorry, but fuck the swear jar.

16
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,239
That word means sex. You're gonna
have sex with the swear jar?

17
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,039
Okay, Tucker, that's enough, honey.

18
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,319
The code's 1234. What are you doing?

19
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,239
The swear jar is full. Look at it.

20
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,879
The swear jar is all the money

21
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,519
we have to send you to college,

22
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,670
so you should be happy I curse.

23
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,267
I heard you, Dad.

24
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,239
Rabbi Perlman says that cursing
is for the simple-minded.

25
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,239
Well, Rabbi Perlman's
breath is so bad,

26
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,599
it makes God question why he even
bothered creating the universe.

27
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,159
Rabbi Perlman's
praying and God's like,

28
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,679
"Please stop, Perlman.
You're welcome.

29
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,386
"You're welcome!"

30
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,159
Well, if you can curse, then we all
can curse. Is that what you want?

31
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,503
- Fine.
- No!

32
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,944
Grace is not gonna curse.

33
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,599
Fuckhead.

34
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,639
Wow!

35
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,919
- Gracie!
- Whoa!

36
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,359
Mom, Dad said that the other day

37
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,759
when someone stole his parking spot.

38
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,719
I did say that, babe,
but he was a fuckhead.

39
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,399
He was in a yellow Hummer.
Who drives a yellow Hummer?

40
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,239
What, is he going to war on the sun?

41
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,439
Dad, we need this car.

42
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,599
We are not getting an Aston Martin.

43
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,799
But for the next minute only,
you can curse.

44
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,959
Then, hairy balls.

45
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,462
Okay. Come on, guys.

46
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,789
Up, up, up. Seat belts.

47
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,719
Tucker! Yarmulke. Tzitzit.

48
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,599
Oh, come on. What is
wrong with you, man?

49
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,679
Get it together.

50
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,959
I was thinking about
that Aston Martin.

51
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,239
Stop thinking about that car.

52
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,399
It's time to start thinking
about the plight of the Jews.

53
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,879
- What does "plight" mean?
- I have no idea.

54
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,799
Ask the rabbis. That's what
we're paying them for.

55
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,479
Aidan, you have to talk
to your father today.

56
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,919
He still hasn't paid
this semester's tuition.

57
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,079
I hate talking to him about money.
When was it due?

58
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,439
Months ago.

59
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,439
Okay, and they're threatening
to kick the kids out of school

60
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,839
if they don't get a check
by the end of this week.

61
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,399
Maybe it's time we put
them in public school.

62
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,479
- No!
- Yay!

63
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,679
Oh, no, no, no, we're not
putting them in the public school.

64
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,944
I'll talk to him today, okay?

65
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,959
Avoid the rabbis if you see them.

66
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,359
I always do!

67
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,919
- Bye, Mom!
- Bye, baby.

68
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,660
Bye!

69
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,421
Bye, sweetie.

70
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,679
You need help gearing
up back there, Yentl?

71
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,359
Don't call me Yentl.

72
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,759
You can call me Yentl.
I love that movie.

73
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,386
I know. I know.

74
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,479
The boys get to do all the
cool things to honor HaShem,

75
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,039
and I won't get to do anything
remotely cool until I buy my sheitel.

76
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,759
Sheitel? What's that again?

77
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,559
It's a modesty wig.

78
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,359
So, when I get married,
I'll shave my head

79
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,639
and wear a wig for
the rest of my life.

80
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,559
That way only my husband
will find me pretty.

81
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,639
No offense, but that's the weirdest
tradition I've ever heard of.

82
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,039
And it wouldn't even work on
you because you're so pretty

83
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,799
that you'd look even
prettier with a shaved head.

84
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,428
So, it would defeat
the whole purpose.

85
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,904
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

86
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,751
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

87
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,906
Hey, guys.

88
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,783
Tucker. Come here. Drill.

89
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,911
I knew it.

90
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,628
I told you. Drill stays at home.

91
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,742
Thank you.

92
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,359
Now go be Jewish.

93
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,359
Why? It's so boring.

94
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,399
I have no idea. Ask the rabbis.

95
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,959
Shalom.

96
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,900
I got it right here.

97
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,239
Oh, come on.

98
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,439
Sorry, just give me a second!

99
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,559
Shalom, Mr. Bloom.

100
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,062
Hey, Rabbi Rosenberg.

101
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,919
Mr. Bloom, Rabbi Twersky

102
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,919
would like to see you in his
office if you have a moment.

103
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,359
Oh, you know, today I can't.

104
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,759
Today, believe it or not,

105
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,759
a moment is something
I just don't have.

106
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,119
I'm gonna have to take a rain check.

107
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,199
Speaking of rain, as you know,

108
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,119
every year to celebrate the
holiday of Tu Bishevat,

109
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,759
we ask the children to donate money

110
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,599
to have a tree planted in Israel.

111
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,639
Yeah, I heard about that, Rabbi.

112
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,679
But when you think
about it, how many trees

113
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,639
do they really need over there?

114
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,999
I feel like Israel is
pretty good on trees.

115
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,479
Which is why, Mr. Bloom,

116
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,950
we encourage the children to plant
a seedling in their own backyard.

117
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,062
You never picked up
your seedling, Mr. Bloom.

118
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,799
Oh, no, no, I'm fine.
Oh, there it is. Okay. Thank you.

119
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,984
Just try not to smoke it.

120
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,221
Clever.

121
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,759
Baruch Hashem.

122
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,151
Yes, bless God. Bless everybody.

123
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,988
I ask you, sir. How many
bangs did Jesus hear?

124
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,799
This entire case is
dependent on your testimony

125
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,509
that on the night of January 7th...

126
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,265
This shit is horrible.
In college, I did Othello.

127
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,679
We all did.

128
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,341
Yup.

129
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,839
Aidan, Paul.

130
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,799
Can I just speak to you both
here for a quick second?

131
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,031
Yeah, sure. Hey, Terry.

132
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,719
Uh... Didn't your agents call you?

133
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,959
We've decided to go
African-American with the role.

134
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,399
Oh. You've got to be kidding me, man.

135
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,479
I've been memorizing this all week.

136
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,551
Does he have to be
a dark black person?

137
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,908
What if he were light-skinned?

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,119
Uh...

139
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,679
I'm sorry, guys.

140
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,959
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What about Ortega?

141
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,239
Ortega, there's a guy on
the witness stand, Ortega.

142
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,230
He's an older Hispanic man.

143
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,581
Hola, señor.

144
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,945
I am on the witness stand
and I only heard one bang.

145
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,941
Uno bang.

146
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,679
There was only one uno bang.

147
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,519
Not three. Uno.

148
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,399
Aidan, please tell me you're not

149
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,279
trying to be an older Hispanic man.

150
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,879
I'm just trying to show
you my range, man.

151
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,519
I really, really need a part.

152
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,227
I'm sorry, guys, all right?

153
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,479
If it's any consolation,
I thought you were Hispanic.

154
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,505
- Gracias.
- De nada.

155
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,780
Fuck!

156
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,519
Oh, yeah, do me like that.

157
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,399
Come on, harder, harder! Oh, yeah.

158
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,947
Catch you at a bad time?

159
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,439
Dad, what the hell?

160
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,465
Trouble in the bedroom, Aidan?

161
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,639
Men have man needs.
Those man needs need to be met.

162
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,079
Well, Sarah doesn't really care
about my man needs right now, Dad.

163
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,199
We have a lot going on.

164
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,159
So, you're taking things into
your own hands, so to speak.

165
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,599
Hilarious. Why haven't you
paid the yeshiva tuition, Dad?

166
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,479
I have aggro rabbis
stalking me in crosswalks.

167
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,079
It's like an Orthodox zombie movie.

168
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,799
We need to talk. But can you
please clean yourself up first?

169
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,599
I can't talk to you with
your pants at your ankles.

170
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,261
Fine.

171
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,302
Kugel, no. Kugel!

172
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,359
Sorry.

173
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,719
I know you can't stand the dog.

174
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,239
He's usually so well trained.

175
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,239
If you trained that dog to
piss everywhere but the lawn,

176
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,559
then you did an incredible job.

177
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,425
Pool looks good.

178
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,466
What are you growing,
typhoid or hepatitis?

179
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,266
What's going on with the fence?

180
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,599
You have a nice little slice
of Mumbai back here, Aidan.

181
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,839
The yard has been this
way since we moved in.

182
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,999
Are you gonna comment on
it every time you see it?

183
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,359
I haven't gotten a decent check

184
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,719
since I did that dandruff commercial.

185
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,826
Ironically, you still have dandruff.

186
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,839
What is going on with
the tuition checks, Dad?

187
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,839
We had a deal.
You said you'd cover it

188
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,079
as long as you got to pick the school.

189
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,359
And you did.

190
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,759
You have your indoctrinated,

191
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,439
little religious grandchildren.

192
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,679
You cannot make me hound
you for these checks.

193
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,944
The cancer's back, Aidan.

194
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,067
I didn't want to worry
you till I knew for sure.

195
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,828
- But now you do.
- Now I do.

196
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,586
And it's pretty bad.

197
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,399
How bad is "pretty bad"?

198
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,439
It's metastasized
from my lungs, spreading.

199
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,959
Oh, my God.

200
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,622
Found this place out in Malibu.

201
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,719
Treats your own stem
cells and then injects

202
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,839
them right back into you.
Good as new.

203
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,229
But I'm going to have
to pay out of pocket.

204
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,399
So...

205
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,631
So, I can't afford the
school anymore, Aidan.

206
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,919
I'm down to my last savings and
I decided to spend it on this.

207
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,421
So, you win.

208
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:03,359
My father has cancer, my children
have to drop out of school,

209
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,639
and I don't have a job.
How could I possibly be winning?

210
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,079
God works in mysterious ways.

211
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,599
This is particularly mysterious.

212
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,023
Oh, one more thing.

213
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,839
I'm gonna be laid up for a while.

214
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,759
I'm gonna need you to watch Kugel.

215
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,504
Oh! There's so much
bad news all at once.

216
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,719
What do we do?

217
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,270
What do you mean, "What do we do?"
We move forward.

218
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,391
It's the only direction God gave us.

219
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,471
Hi, sweetie.

220
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,951
Noah!

221
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,830
I know you're in there.
I can hear you trolling.

222
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,159
Noah, I'm not leaving!

223
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,279
Go away!

224
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,067
Dude, I drove all the way out here.
Open the fucking door.

225
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,159
What's the password?

226
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,239
Um... Is it,

227
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,159
"Your father's dying and
I need to talk to you"?

228
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,639
I knew that was it.

229
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,427
Sunlight, Noah. Noah, sunlight.

230
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,319
Is Dad really dying again or
are you just crying wolf?

231
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,919
It's all over his body, Noah.
The wolf is here.

232
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,719
Kugel, no!

233
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,199
No, no, no, don't stop him.

234
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,159
I can't stand that fucking guy.

235
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,439
Get over here. Kugel!

236
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,541
Lie down.

237
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,941
Your can looks good.

238
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,079
You know when you make
fun of my trailer, Aidan,

239
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,999
you're making fun of
my inheritance from Mom.

240
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,679
She wanted me to live how I choose.

241
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,919
And to be free to pursue
the goals that I have.

242
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,239
And what are those goals?

243
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,559
I thought you were gonna, like,

244
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,199
develop an iPhone app or something.

245
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,359
No, no, fuck apps. Fuck apps.

246
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,759
It's a saturated market.
I'm gonna start blogging.

247
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,599
Look, I have two problems and one,

248
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,039
I think you might be
able to help me with.

249
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,199
- What?
- Kugel.

250
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,479
- Fuck off.
- Dude, I can't raise two kids

251
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,279
and go on auditions and
take care of this dog.

252
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,039
Absolutely not.

253
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,199
Are you kidding me?
This is our father.

254
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,719
Our father. You have
to rally with me.

255
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,599
Oh. Okay. So,
when you get old and sick,

256
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,239
everybody's just supposed to
forget that you were an asshole?

257
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,799
I know he's not easy.

258
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,599
Trust me, no one knows
that better than me.

259
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,879
What's the other one?

260
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,919
What?

261
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,479
You said that there were
two problems, Aidan.

262
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,479
I will help you with the
one that's not that dog.

263
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,119
The other one is that

264
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,719
he's gonna try an
experimental treatment now,

265
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,439
and he can't afford to send the
kids to the yeshiva anymore.

266
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,386
Well, it sounds like you
really got your hands full.

267
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,519
Live long and prosper.

268
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,399
- Are you serious?
- I gotta get back to work.

269
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,063
A blogger never rests.
Don't you dare leave that dog.

270
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,799
...as he searches for his first love.

271
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,586
What a beautiful tortoise.

272
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,319
Can I say something that's
probably gonna piss you off?

273
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,946
I can't wait.

274
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,826
Why don't you homeschool them?

275
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,348
Are you kidding me?
What are we, Amish?

276
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,759
I've been looking online and there's
a whole new movement out there.

277
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,239
Cities that public
schools are suffering,

278
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,902
some parents are
considering other options.

279
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,799
Dad, can we buy drugs
at our public school?

280
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,839
What?

281
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,679
Uncle Noah said he used to buy
drugs at his public school.

282
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,719
No, man, that was the '90s.

283
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,599
This is LA. There's a weed
pharmacy on every corner.

284
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,119
All you need is 50
bucks and a headache.

285
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,199
- Honey, don't tell him that.
- If you're implying

286
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,919
you want me to give up acting,
you should just say it.

287
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,399
I think you should give up acting.

288
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,839
I will not give up acting.

289
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,319
We can't afford private school,

290
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,679
you're afraid of public school.

291
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,119
It's the middle of the school year.

292
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,599
You want to just drop these two
little indoctrinated matzo balls

293
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,799
into a school that's ranked
last in the district?

294
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,985
I agree with you,
but what's your plan, Dad?

295
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,599
Grace, what's the Hebrew
word for charity again?

296
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,467
Tzedakah.

297
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,825
Tzedakah.

298
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,549
Mr. Bloom, Baruch Hashem.

299
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,030
Please have a seat.

300
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,102
Do you ever watch these YouTubes?

301
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,542
YouTube? Yes, I've seen YouTube.

302
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:51,547
This kitten will not allow his
brother to sleep, no matter what.

303
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,231
You know kittens,
they're always doing something.

304
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:00,199
Mr. Bloom, please,
can I help you today?

305
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,919
Well, Rabbi, as I'm sure you know,

306
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,519
my father has been paying
our tuition here at Hillel.

307
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,879
Unfortunately, he's taken ill

308
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,679
and he can no longer afford
to cover us anymore.

309
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,627
Oh, yes, I've been
counseling your father.

310
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,559
I am deeply sorry about his illness.

311
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,079
Thank you.

312
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,639
I hope you're not withdrawing
the children from this school.

313
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,039
That's the thing.

314
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,559
We could only afford to
go here with his help.

315
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,063
Ah, yes. You're the actor.

316
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,399
- Yes.
- Uh-huh.

317
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,586
And your wife provides for the family

318
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,199
while you act.

319
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,781
Yes.

320
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,239
But I was hoping that
you might consider

321
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,230
giving us a little

322
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,519
tzedakah.

323
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,022
A tzedakah.

324
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:04,759
Mr. Bloom, if you want
to buy a gallon of milk

325
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,559
when you only have enough
money for a glass of milk,

326
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:13,799
you must first take that
money from somewhere else.

327
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,999
So, maybe you decided that

328
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,743
this week you will give up honey.

329
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,119
I'm not a honey guy, but go on.

330
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,119
If I give you charity,

331
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:30,639
I must take away funds from
one of the several families

332
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,759
to whom we currently
provide assistance.

333
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,959
Families who actually
need the assistance.

334
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,879
Not just someone who's made
a choice to be an actor

335
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,639
and thusly cannot
provide for his family.

336
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,319
But what about my dream?

337
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,999
I mean, doesn't God believe
in my pursuit of happiness?

338
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,119
No! That's the Declaration
of Independence.

339
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,479
Thomas Jefferson cared
about your happiness.

340
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,519
God wants you to provide
for your family, Mr. Bloom.

341
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:10,823
God believes your family
deserves both milk and honey.

342
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,541
Well, thank you.

343
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,901
Thank you.

344
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,239
I'm sorry to interrupt, Rabbi.

345
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,185
I'm sorry to interrupt
everyone. Grace!

346
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,399
Tucker, wake up!

347
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,599
Grace, Tucker, come on.

348
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,359
Put a wiggle in it. Come on.

349
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,599
Let's go, please. So sorry,
everyone. It's beautiful.

350
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,105
Shalom. Sayonara. Keep it real.

351
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,199
But I don't want to leave school.
I like it there.

352
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,919
And what about all my friends?

353
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,799
You'll make new friends, okay?
Better friends.

354
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,439
It's a horrible idea.
You don't know anything.

355
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,159
What are you gonna teach them?
How to do the acting?

356
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,399
There's websites, Dad. There's books.

357
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,399
It's only till the end of
the semester. We'll be fine.

358
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,719
You're burdening them
with your fears.

359
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,199
Just 'cause you got beat up in the
public school doesn't mean they will.

360
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,279
You got beat up?

361
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,439
- No. No.
- Oh, yes.

362
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,999
Tell them the truth.
They picked on him.

363
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,759
With his Dungeons & Dragons

364
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,079
and scientific-fiction movies.

365
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,279
I got in one fight.

366
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,999
You marry a half-Jew, you provide
your children with absolutely

367
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,559
no sense of spirituality or
faith in a higher power.

368
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,079
Now, for dessert,
you spoon-feed them all your fears.

369
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,150
It's a mess, Aidan.

370
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:04,239
Sweetie, look at the
outfit I got you today.

371
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,959
How cute is this?

372
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,319
I'm not wearing that.

373
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,399
Really?

374
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,919
I thought it was so cute and...

375
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,959
Mom, do my clothes embarrass you?

376
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,759
No. No.

377
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,864
Really, honey, they don't.

378
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,479
No, I want you to be
whoever you want to be.

379
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,159
"Whomever."

380
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,230
Whomever.

381
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,309
Then why do you want me to dress
like I'm on the Disney Channel?

382
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,359
I just thought that since
you're not going to yeshiva

383
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:44,342
that you might want to try
something more colorful.

384
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,981
What do you think?

385
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,799
I think that...

386
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,702
That God is testing
my faith right now.

387
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,346
And I probably shouldn't
make any drastic changes.

388
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,999
I'm sorry, Mom.

389
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,839
No, don't be sorry. It's fine.

390
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,911
It's fine. Let's just
forget about it.

391
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,664
It's silly of me.

392
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,639
I'm gonna pray that God
helps Dad get a job and...

393
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,919
Mmm. Yeah.

394
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,981
...that Uncle Noah's
anti-depressants start to work.

395
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,550
And that you get happy, too.

396
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,542
I'm happy, sweetie.

397
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,582
Mom, no, you're not.

398
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,759
I know you're a hermit
and everything,

399
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,439
but if you don't stop that
fucking dog from barking,

400
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,879
I am going to roll your
trailer off the cliff.

401
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,959
Kugel, shut the fuck up!

402
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,079
Why are you wearing Muppet pants?

403
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,199
They're not Muppet pants.

404
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,159
I'm working on my
outfit for Comic-Con.

405
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,399
Are you a Furry?

406
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,039
I hate that term.

407
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,439
I'm a character designer
of full-size plush toys.

408
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,759
So you're a Furry.

409
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,919
Do you ever leave this trailer?

410
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,919
Are you always so abrasive?

411
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,039
Well, does your trailer
always smell like

412
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,399
the Burger King himself ate Grimace

413
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,519
and then shit him out all
over your living room?

414
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,079
Grimace is in Ronald
McDonald's posse.

415
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,319
Originally introduced in
November 1971 as "Evil Grimace."

416
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,982
You're mixing up your
fast-food character lore.

417
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,119
The fact that you know that

418
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,599
has told me everything I
need to know about you.

419
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,479
You know, when your
brother was six years old,

420
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,391
we thought something
was wrong with him.

421
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,319
I remember a psychologist at school

422
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,439
gave him this battery of tests.

423
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,599
When they come out, she says,

424
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,341
"He's not disabled. He's a genius."

425
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,119
I remember strutting around and I was
going about my business thinking,

426
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,145
"I'm the father of a genius."

427
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,439
Do you have any idea
how much pride I felt?

428
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,021
A lot.

429
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,507
I imagined us working together side
by side at the university one day.

430
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,199
High hopes.

431
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,719
Why is it that whenever we're alone,

432
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,159
all you want to talk about is Noah?

433
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,199
I can't even have a conversation
with him. I say hello, he says,

434
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,429
"How do you say
hello to me like that?"

435
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,679
Do you mind if I pick you
up after your treatment?

436
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,799
I have an audition that
I really want to go to.

437
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,559
This auditioning, when are
you gonna give that up?

438
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,319
I don't know, Dad. But not yet.

439
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,399
Well, you can hardly call
yourself head of the household.

440
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,719
- Thank you.
- I know it's 2014.

441
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,479
In my time, men would rather die

442
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,679
than let his wife work
her fingers to the bone

443
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,839
while he clowns around.

444
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,519
Okay, "clowns around."
You're forgetting

445
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,039
something that's very important,

446
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,399
and that is that Sarah loves her job.

447
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,439
She is living her dream.

448
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,387
Sometimes when I forget
to wear my underpants,

449
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,824
I get, like,
these little half-boners.

450
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,544
You know, like, aspirational boners.

451
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:23,823
"Someday I'm gonna grow up and
I'm gonna be a full-on boner."

452
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,271
Hmm. "Just have to work hard enough."

453
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,068
That was the half-boner talking.
I was doing his voice.

454
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,430
I figured that out, Jerry.

455
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,959
Can you please stop talking?

456
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,719
'Cause I have a
shit-ton of work to do.

457
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,905
And I, um, appreciate it.

458
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,879
Want a back massage?

459
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,839
Will you please shut the fuck up?

460
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,399
You're so fucking inappropriate.

461
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,426
This is not a frat house, Jerry.
It is a place of business.

462
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,950
Whoa. Easy, Jane Fonda.

463
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,119
Just trying to have some fun at work.

464
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,759
Believe it or not, I don't
want to know about your dick.

465
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,959
Well, my dick doesn't want
to know about you, either.

466
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,519
- Good.
- How's that?

467
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,263
Yeah. So now we're ignoring you.

468
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,039
Hi, Jesse.

469
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,159
Hi, Grace.

470
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,439
How come you're not in school?

471
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,959
Bomb scare. What about you?

472
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,959
We're gonna be homeschooled.

473
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,359
Are you Amish?

474
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,999
No, we're Jewish.

475
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,439
But we just can't afford
private school anymore.

476
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,559
But I thought Jews ran Hollywood.

477
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,239
I thought so, too.

478
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,039
Maybe we're in the wrong
tribe or something.

479
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,719
Anyway, it's just till the end of the year.

480
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,359
I'm gonna go to Roosevelt
for seventh grade.

481
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,999
- Me, too!
- Really?

482
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,150
- Yeah.
- Cool.

483
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,319
Hey, um, so my sister always has
this big end-of-the-year pool party.

484
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,319
It's usually pretty awesome.

485
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,821
Do you want to come?

486
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,559
No, thank you. I never
learned how to swim.

487
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,789
And I don't even have a bathing suit.

488
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,999
Why not?

489
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,159
Well, God says that a woman's

490
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,150
supposed to keep her body covered up.

491
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,145
Okay, well, I guess you got a few
months if you change your mind, so...

492
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,989
Right. Cool.

493
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,359
Yeah. Okay, well, I'll see you later.

494
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,439
Yeah. See ya.

495
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,479
Okay.

496
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,823
- Bye.
- Bye, Jesse.

497
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,199
Okay, good morning, students.

498
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,639
- Good morning.
- Goodbye.

499
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,799
Okay, we'll start with attendance.

500
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,159
- Grace.
- Here!

501
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,999
And Too-ker?

502
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,599
This is boring already.

503
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,999
Oh. We'll take that as a "here."

504
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,719
Okay, I wanna focus on what
you're doing in school.

505
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,159
Grace, what are you currently
working on in school?

506
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,199
Geometry.

507
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,639
Geometry, geometry

508
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,519
This is the song for geometry

509
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,879
Okay, who knows what this guy is?

510
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,719
- Triangle!
- Great!

511
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,839
No extra points for yelling,
but you are correct.

512
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,879
Yay, recess!

513
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,199
No, no, no, no recess. Back, back,
back, no recess. Thank you.

514
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,719
And can you please sit on
your ass and not your head?

515
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,439
An ass is a donkey.

516
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,319
That's correct.
You get an A in biology.

517
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,639
- Dad?
- Yes.

518
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,159
I'm in honors math.

519
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,519
We're learning things like supplementary
and complimentary angles,

520
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,399
determining the area of a
three-dimensional shape, circumferences.

521
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,879
I know all that, Grace.
We're starting with...

522
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,719
We're starting with some
of the basic stuff,

523
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,919
and then going to the
good stuff, you know?

524
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,879
You go see Sting in concert,

525
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,359
he's not gonna just jump
into The Police songs.

526
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,919
You're gonna have to
hear a couple hours of

527
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,879
some wacky stuff with the dizzery-do.

528
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,479
Dad, I have to take a choom.

529
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,559
What's a choom?

530
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,199
It's how we say "shit" in school.

531
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,279
- Swear jar!
- I don't have any money.

532
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,279
See, that's where the whole swear
jar thing falls apart for me.

533
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,919
I'm the only one
putting money into it.

534
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,719
It's Hebrew for "brown."

535
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,879
Oh.

536
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,119
Got it!

537
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,319
You are free to leave the
classroom for your brown. Enjoy.

538
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,959
Grace, is this triangle
complimentary?

539
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,719
Or is it one of those
supplementary guys?

540
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,879
A triangle can't be
complimentary or supplementary.

541
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,190
Only the angles that comprise
it can be judged that way.

542
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,262
Right. Good. Good, exactly.

543
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,999
The triangle that you drew,
albeit poorly, is isosceles,

544
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,759
meaning that at least two of
its sides are equal in length.

545
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,799
Right.

546
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,119
So, for example,

547
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:34,309
what angle is complimentary
to a 45-degree angle?

548
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,639
Well, if they're gonna add up to 90,

549
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,319
it would be a 45-degree angle.

550
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,439
- Correct.
- Yes!

551
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,863
Good. Now for a
supplementary angle...

552
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,599
- Hey! Hey!
- Tucker!

553
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,159
What are you doing, man?
We're in the middle of a lesson.

554
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,879
I lied about having to choom, Dad.

555
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,479
I just wanted to kill the triangle.

556
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,039
No! Well, turn it off.
We are in the middle of school.

557
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,319
This isn't fun time.

558
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,519
I was pretending
the triangle was Arab.

559
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,639
What? Oh, my God. Who told you that?

560
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,159
Not all Arabs are bad.

561
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,159
Levi Goldfarb said all
Arabs want to kill Jews.

562
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,799
Well, Levi Goldfarb is wrong.
That's not true at all.

563
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,319
Well, how do we know
which ones are bad?

564
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,519
It's complicated,

565
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,639
and I didn't know we were
gonna get there on day one,

566
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,359
but, um, for starters
there's al-Qaeda.

567
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,679
The black weatherman?

568
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,341
No, that's Al Roker.

569
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,479
Al Roker wants to kill Jews?

570
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,599
No, buddy, he's very good
friends with Matt Lauer.

571
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,879
I'm pretty sure he's Jewish.
We'll Google it.

572
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,319
Grace is the teacher?

573
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,199
Yes, Grace is the
teacher for the minute.

574
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,359
Grace is so boring!

575
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,079
- Don't say that.
- No, I'm not!

576
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,319
I want to be the teacher!

577
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,239
Okay, you can be.
What do you want to teach us?

578
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,999
- How to be an idiot.
- Don't say that.

579
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,719
I am not an idiot!
And you're in love with Jesse.

580
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,319
- No, she's not.
- No, I'm not!

581
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,199
Then why did you write his
name all over your notebook?

582
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,439
You wrote his name all
over your notebook?

583
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,519
- What is wrong with you?
- Yeah, you know what?

584
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,359
- That is my notebook!
- You should not look in her notebook.

585
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,719
Jesse's gonna put his penis on you!

586
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,839
- Stop fucking cursing!
- Swear jar!

587
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,679
We all ride a
merry-go-round of feelings.

588
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,199
Going round and round,

589
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,239
up and down,
from one emotion to another.

590
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,119
And I bet if you think
back over your day,

591
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,145
you'll realize that you've been sad,

592
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,584
confused, happy or excited
at least once already.

593
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,119
I know I have.

594
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,909
But one of the best things about
feelings is sharing them.

595
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,584
See you next time.

596
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,799
What's going on?

597
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,999
I know it looks weird,
but they're having a lesson.

598
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,585
Aidan, why are the children
duct-taped to chairs?

599
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,879
They wouldn't listen to me.

600
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,359
I couldn't get control
of them, Sarah.

601
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,519
They asked about al-Qaeda. I have to
work on this audition for tomorrow,

602
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,879
and LeVar Burton seems to be the
only thing that calms them down.

603
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,319
Fortunately for us, I have Roots.

604
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,279
Okay, this is not gonna work.

605
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,679
You can't just show the kids videos,

606
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,999
and you certainly can't
force them into learning.

607
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,119
Well, then what's your idea?

608
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,359
Because they're fighting
every single thing I try.

609
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,227
We need to regroup.

610
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,759
Why don't we go to dinner?

611
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,830
Who's gonna babysit?

612
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,519
Lego Death Star is worth
three hours of babysitting,

613
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,279
if, and only if, it's in the box,
and said box is in mint condition.

614
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,544
It is. It's brand-new.

615
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,300
Can I keep them taped up like that?

616
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,864
No. No.

617
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,304
I'll free them.
You've got three hours.

618
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,346
What's the happiest
you've ever seen me?

619
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,105
Surfing.

620
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,919
What? That was like 100 years ago.

621
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,390
It's the first thing
that came to my mind.

622
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,519
I remember I was lying on
the beach reading a book,

623
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,319
and you were taking those lessons.

624
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,159
And I was watching you

625
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,319
and you kept trying to get up,

626
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,346
trying to get up,
and then you finally got up.

627
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,230
And I couldn't see your face
'cause you were kinda far out.

628
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:10,229
I could just feel it, this elation,

629
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,959
this pure joy.

630
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,862
The happiest you've ever seen
me is a smile you never saw?

631
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,349
I guess, yeah. Is that weird?

632
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,959
I suppose it's beautiful
in a bizarre kind of way.

633
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,261
What's the happiest
you've ever seen me?

634
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,999
You were doing a Shakespeare
thing outside at Northwestern.

635
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,199
Romeo and Juliet.

636
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,781
Yeah.

637
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,359
And no one was there.

638
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,999
I mean, no one was there.

639
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,399
There were a few people that
were there, but I get the point.

640
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,559
It wasn't even a real show.

641
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,519
You were just, like,
in the middle of a soccer field.

642
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,879
It was a traveling production.

643
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,079
And it was really fucking
thrilling to watch.

644
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,948
'Cause you loved words.
You loved poetry.

645
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,383
But I do remember it
kinda made me feel sad.

646
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,506
Why?

647
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,119
Honey, I want to support you.

648
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,999
I really do believe in you.

649
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,559
Why did seeing me love
Shakespeare make you sad?

650
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,199
I don't know.

651
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,839
I was terrified that
I'd never ever find

652
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,439
that kind of passion in my life.

653
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,271
And the truth is, I haven't.

654
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,799
I input data into a spreadsheet.

655
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,999
Literally, a scanner
should be doing my job,

656
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,879
and there's just too much bureaucracy
for anyone to even notice.

657
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,399
One day you're gonna be running
that whole fucking place.

658
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,599
I don't want to run the
fucking water department.

659
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,959
Then what do you want to do?
I don't even know.

660
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,279
I don't know. And you know what?

661
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,359
I don't have a second
to figure it out,

662
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,319
because I'm on a fucking treadmill.

663
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,279
And if I stop, our kids don't eat.

664
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,748
And it's all on me.

665
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,639
I just...

666
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,599
I thought you supported my dream.

667
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,670
You said you supported my dream.

668
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,959
When did this relationship become

669
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,304
solely about supporting your dream?

670
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,426
Hello?

671
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,186
Yes?

672
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,745
Oh, my God.

673
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,267
Dr. Becker, what happened?

674
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,359
I told him the new-age
treatment was nonsense,

675
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,799
but desperate people
will try anything.

676
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,919
It didn't work?

677
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,039
The cancer's progressed.

678
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,519
He's having paraneoplastic symptoms,

679
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,119
his liver's beginning to fail.

680
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,479
Can we see him?

681
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:59,905
Well, he's sleeping, but he's
right in here in ICU. Come.

682
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,359
Okay, okay, let's just calm down.

683
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,439
What are you talking about, Noah?
Why would we not be calm?

684
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,999
Look, before you freak out,

685
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,399
I still get the Death Star.

686
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,061
What's happening, Noah?

687
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,919
This.

688
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,946
- Oh, my God!
- What the fuck!

689
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,599
I am tired of you guys
not listening to me.

690
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,719
I just want to go back to
yeshiva and be with my friends,

691
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,399
and I am sick and tired of Tucker

692
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,550
always teasing me about Jesse.

693
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,879
Now everyone will know who I am.

694
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,519
So you shaved your head?

695
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,039
Sweetie, your beautiful hair.

696
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,559
Your beautiful hair.

697
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,239
You said that I would still be
pretty even if I shaved my head!

698
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,119
- What?
- No, completely out of context.

699
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,239
What are you talking about?

700
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,399
I was talking about the
Orthodox wig thing.

701
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,879
This is not what I was talking about.

702
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,679
I was just innocently playing
video games with the boy when...

703
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,079
- Tucker!
- Tucker, great kid.

704
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,279
Really a lot smarter
than I thought...

705
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,799
- You let her shave her fucking head?
- No, no!

706
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,399
You know, they were just
having their normal banter.

707
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,759
I certainly didn't think that

708
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,919
she was gonna come out looking
like fucking Sinead O'Connor.

709
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,959
Okay, I shouldn't cry, right?

710
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,559
- No, don't cry. It's just hair.
- 'Cause it's just hair.

711
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,119
It'll grow back in, like, a year.

712
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,199
- Go to your room!
- What's going on?

713
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,759
- Don't go to your room.
- Go in the house!

714
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,559
- I'll go to your room.
- Go in the house!

715
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,159
- Go inside.
- Feel better. Feel better, kiddo.

716
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,999
And you get the fuck out of here.

717
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,599
What about our little Lego situation?

718
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:47,279
My child shaved her head
while you were babysitting.

719
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,759
You think you're getting
a Lego Death Star?

720
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,119
You're out of your fucking mind.

721
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,319
You're a fucking Indian giver.

722
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,479
You're a piece of shit Indian giver.

723
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,999
And by the way, do you know
where I just came from?

724
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,519
Your father lying
comatose in the hospital

725
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,999
with wires and veins and
the thing in his nose.

726
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,679
I thought he was on some sort of...

727
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,639
No, the treatment didn't work, man.
He's dying for real, okay?

728
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,799
How long does he have?

729
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,159
I don't know, but the fact
that you're asking that,

730
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,519
what, are you gonna procrastinate?

731
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,759
Cancer means dying, Noah,
and you need to wake up,

732
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,831
because life is happening
all around you.

733
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,319
Oh.

734
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,719
Nice to see you, Mr. Bloom.

735
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,959
Sorry it's under such
difficult circumstances.

736
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,621
I have something for you.

737
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,799
Sorry to throw all
of this at you now.

738
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,349
It does have to be dealt with
sooner rather than later.

739
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,225
He's very sick. Counsel the actor.

740
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:28,987
Come over here.
Don't be fooled by all this.

741
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,827
It's all to cover their
asses so nobody gets sued.

742
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,500
I'm fine.

743
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,479
So, Dad, I'm confused.

744
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,599
You said there was this
experimental treatment.

745
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,479
They told me from the beginning

746
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,267
it doesn't work for everyone.

747
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,919
I rolled the dice.

748
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,759
But did Dr. Becker give
you any new information?

749
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,359
Did he say anything about...

750
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,545
A few months. Maybe a year.

751
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,144
Or as long as it takes
them to finish the 405.

752
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,351
If I died every time he
said I was gonna die,

753
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,742
I'd have more lives than
Shirley MacLaine. Jesus.

754
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,670
Did you see that pitch?

755
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,589
If Collins doesn't pull a new
pitcher out of the bullpen soon,

756
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,782
I'm gonna yank all these tubes
and jump out the window.

757
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,902
Hey, is there any water over there?

758
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,424
Yeah.

759
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,383
You okay?

760
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,861
Yeah.

761
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,710
I mean, I guess, no.

762
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,759
It's funny, you spend your whole life

763
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,159
hoping it'll all mean something,

764
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,839
and ultimately it
really comes down to

765
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,719
one question in a
neatly folded pamphlet.

766
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,159
How should we deal with your bones?

767
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,550
Honey, maybe you shouldn't
be looking at that right now.

768
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,186
How are the kids?

769
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,319
Scared.

770
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,821
Yeah.

771
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,039
I just always imagined

772
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:19,386
I'd have a better handle on what
I believed by the time we had kids.

773
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,319
And we got pregnant so young,

774
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,319
and now I have these
little faces looking up

775
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,279
at me and I don't know what to say.

776
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,319
I know, I'm with you. Fuck if I know

777
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,231
what we're supposed to be doing here.

778
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,949
As parents or on Earth?

779
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,239
Can I say both?

780
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,746
Gracie, wake up, sleepyhead.

781
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,879
What's going on?

782
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,621
We're going on a field trip.

783
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,423
I made you a bowl
of cereal, but I ate it.

784
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:47,186
Is Grandpa gonna die?

785
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,239
It looks that way, sweetie.

786
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:55,062
Are we gonna bury him in
the backyard with Whiskers?

787
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,399
Oh, buddy, I don't think
we're allowed to do that.

788
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,159
We're gonna have to ask
Grandpa what he wants.

789
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,904
I think he'll want
to be with Whiskers.

790
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,582
All right, guys, here we are.

791
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:34,999
Follow me.

792
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,239
Shouldn't we set up our camp?

793
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,719
We'll do it later. This way.

794
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:38,799
What are we doing out here?

795
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,479
I'm showing you one of the
coolest places on Earth.

796
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,079
I'll race you to the top.

797
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,919
Wow! Look at those legs!

798
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,199
Lookit, the little legs are fastest!

799
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:54,102
This is it. This is the spot.

800
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,119
What is it?

801
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,959
This is the spot where I
had one of the deepest,

802
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,111
most sincere, spiritual
moments of my life.

803
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,701
The last time I had an epiphany,
it was right here.

804
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,426
What's an "aniffany"?

805
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,639
An epiphany is when
you realize something

806
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,319
that you really needed to realize.

807
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,959
You know, sometimes in life
you can get kinda stuck

808
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,359
and you feel like you should
have changed chapters by now,

809
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:22,147
but you can't.

810
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:26,559
Are you stuck because
Grandpa's dying?

811
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,559
Am I stuck because Grandpa's dying?

812
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,759
Uh, yeah.

813
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,119
I think that's one of the reasons.

814
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:36,305
And because you haven't worked
since that dandruff commercial?

815
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,903
That's in there, too.
Thanks for reminding me.

816
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,839
Well, the sun went down.

817
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,119
What do you guys say,
should we make a fire?

818
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,159
Yeah.

819
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,821
All right, let's do it.

820
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,229
Help him out, Grace, help him out.

821
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,988
Will Grandpa be able to
see us when he dies?

822
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,279
I don't know, buddy. I don't know.

823
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:07,181
Nobody knows what
happens when you die.

824
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,706
There's as many opinions
as there are people.

825
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:16,502
And some people will tell you with
absolute certainty they know.

826
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,545
But they're wrong?

827
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,479
No. No, I'm not saying they're wrong.

828
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,062
Right now I kinda
feel like they're lucky.

829
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:29,183
'Cause the rest of us, until we

830
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,119
see something that makes sense,

831
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:36,159
until we hear something we believe,

832
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,550
we're kinda left with nothing.

833
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,359
Tell us a ghost story.

834
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,399
I don't know any
ghost stories. Do you?

835
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,559
I'll think about it.

836
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,599
All right, you think on it.

837
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,119
I can think of one, too.

838
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,519
I know they usually end
with someone has a claw.

839
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,759
I could tell you something Grandma

840
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,039
used to say to me when I went to bed.

841
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,079
How about that?

842
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,199
- Okay.
- All right.

843
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,065
I remember a little bit.

844
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,239
"And indeed there will be time

845
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:06,903
"For the yellow smoke that
slides along the street

846
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:10,839

847
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,580
"There will be time

848
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,239
"There will be time

849
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:19,301
"To prepare a face to meet
the faces that you meet

850
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,428
"There will be time

851
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,679
"And time for all the

852
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:33,629

853
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:39,385
"Time for you and time for me

854
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,588
"And time yet for 100 indecisions

855
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:47,999

856
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,791
"Before the taking
of a toast and tea"

857
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,279
Wake up, sleepyheads.

858
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,270
It's time for school.

859
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,944
Did you have an epiphany?

860
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:19,542
No. But I did have
a really good idea.

861
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,599
You can pick any one you want.

862
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,590
- Any one?
- Any one.

863
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:35,670
Just as long as it is unique
and amazing like you.

864
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,945
Oh, hey, pal. Come on in.

865
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,581
Oh!

866
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:12,389
Just watching this kitten video
on YouTube. This kitten is crazy.

867
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,799
Sorry, can I talk to
you about something?

868
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,907
Sure. Come on in. Have a seat.
What's on your mind?

869
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,959
It's just that I'm
having some trouble

870
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:25,039
getting used to my cubicle partner.

871
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,544
- Jerry? But he's hilarious.
- Yeah.

872
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:35,425
It's just that he's a
little inappropriate and...

873
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,959
I know I'm relatively new here.

874
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:41,639
So I don't want to ruffle
anyone's status quo.

875
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,439
But I think it's time I let you know

876
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,039
that he's making me uncomfortable.

877
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,999
Okay, so what did he say?

878
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,119
Well, he started with saying that

879
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,270
when he's not wearing any underwear,

880
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:00,119
that he gets these
little half-boners.

881
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,621
Mmm-hmm.

882
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,159
He also made it talk to me.

883
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,359
Who?

884
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,199
His half-boner.

885
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,799
Well, what did it sound like?

886
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:14,279
I don't know.
It's like a high-pitched...

887
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,919
Like a ghost voice.

888
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:22,319
Okay, but he didn't do a black
guy voice or anything, did he?

889
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,026
He didn't do anything racial?

890
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,959
No, it was high-pitched.

891
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,559
- Good.
- Like a mouse.

892
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,599
Or, like I said, a ghost.

893
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,279
Like a ghost mouse.

894
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,799
Sure.

895
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,799
Okay, okay. Look, Sarah,

896
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,279
I know we don't always run things

897
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,599
according to the book around here,

898
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,519
but I think you need
to lighten up a little bit.

899
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,199
Nobody's trying to touch you.

900
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,079
No one's making their
penis talk like a rapper.

901
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:50,079
So, I'll tell you what. I am going
to move Jerry out of your cubicle

902
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,639
and I'm also gonna tell him
to tone it down a notch.

903
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:55,639
But you need to promise
to smile a little more.

904
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,347
You know, a little bit
more Hakuna matata.

905
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,639
I don't know what that means.

906
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,319
It means, "No worries for
the rest of your days."

907
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,399
No, I have two children,
I know it's from The Lion King.

908
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:08,639
I just don't understand how that
applies to the water department.

909
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,079
It means that you need to
lighten up a little bit, Sarah.

910
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,662
You've got something
everybody else wants.

911
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,999
Remind me what that is.

912
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,025
A job.

913
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:24,906
Right.

914
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,839
Well, I guess technically this
could qualify as art class.

915
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,159
Hey, bud, make sure you're cutting

916
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,799
along the lines here
that I drew, okay?

917
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,399
That's for the chest piece.
It's very special.

918
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,199
Aren't you a little old
for playing dress-up?

919
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,759
It's hardly playing dress-up, Aidan.

920
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:43,119
It's for Comic-Con.
The top prize is $1,000.

921
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,679
Not to mention the chance for
some congratulatory poontang

922
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,479
from a super-hot Furry I just met.

923
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,519
What's poontang?

924
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:49,679
It's what the astronauts drink.

925
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,559
- Can I have some poontang?
- One day.

926
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:52,879
It's only available in space.

927
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,506
Damn it.

928
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,879
So, hey, we're gonna meet
up at my house around 6:30

929
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,199
and then we'll go see Dad, okay?

930
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,199
Oh, yeah, right. I've been meaning
to talk to you about that, Aidan.

931
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,039
You know, I got a ton of work
here and plus, I'm not going.

932
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,279
What?

933
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,319
Dude, what's the point?
I haven't seen him for, like, a year.

934
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,879
I guess my tolerance for being called

935
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,399
a disappointment has
an expiration date.

936
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,839
You haven't spoken to Dad in a year?

937
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,159
No. The last time he called
me was on my birthday.

938
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,719
I think my present was a
20-minute thesis on why I suck.

939
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:24,109
So you're just gonna cut him off.

940
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,879
Dude, you gotta see this
from my perspective, okay?

941
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,159
You at least have
a wife and a family.

942
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,119
When he looks at me,
all he sees is failure.

943
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,679
Well, what about Grandma?

944
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:39,239
No. My mom believed in me.

945
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,839
With her, things were different.

946
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,799
She at least made
him a tad bit nicer.

947
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,879
But with my dad...

948
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,826
Nope, never gave him any
reason to be proud of me.

949
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,225
All right, let's try it on.

950
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:59,199
Well, what do you think?

951
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,861
- So cool.
- Awesome!

952
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,266
Aidan?

953
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:11,429
We both spent our entire lives
wishing we could be something great.

954
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,599
And now we're finally
called upon to do something

955
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:17,229
that requires some actual
bravery and you run and hide.

956
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:23,719
You know what the problem with
hiding in a fish bowl is, Noah?

957
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:25,631
Everyone can see you.

958
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:29,900
Come on, guys. Let's go see Grandpa.

959
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,823
Grace, come on.

960
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,279
Bye, Uncle Noah. I love you.

961
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,421
All right. Thanks. Thank you.

962
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:01,399
I'm lost in balloons.
Right in here. Right in...

963
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:04,519
Look who it is, Grandpa!

964
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,039
Give Grandpa a hug.

965
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:09,319
Hey. Thank you.

966
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,679
Got you some balloons.

967
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,639
Mommy will put those in the corner.

968
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,187
I'll take those.

969
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,221
What's wrong, Dad?

970
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,879
What'd these hippies do to your hair?

971
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,719
Oh, it's just temporary dye, Dad.
She was just having a little fun.

972
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:24,839
- Right, Gracie?
- Yeah.

973
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,866
Looks like you work in the
world's oldest profession.

974
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,199
What's the world's oldest profession?

975
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,399
Being an angel was the
very first job there was.

976
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,106
Beautiful angel.

977
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,439
I am your angel, Grandpa.

978
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,879
I daven a healing prayer
for you three times a day.

979
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,030
- Once in the morning, once...
- Grandpa!

980
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,839
I bought you a fart buzzer.

981
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,199
What's a fart buzzer?

982
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,519
It's this thing.

983
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,839
You press different buttons

984
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:50,079
and it makes different
funny fart noises.

985
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,959
You may choose any
fart you would like.

986
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,799
I choose for you the Ripper.

987
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,542
Oh, I see the
homeschooling's going well.

988
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:09,319
Tucker, do you know
your times tables yet?

989
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:11,639
No. But I know this.

990
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,519
I don't know if Grandpa's a
big fan of the fart buzzer.

991
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,279
- I'm gonna take the fart buzzer.
- Put that away.

992
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,759
You gotta learn those times tables.

993
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:21,199
Oh, he's just working
on addition, Dad.

994
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,119
Yeah. He's six.

995
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,399
I know my times tables.

996
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,359
Yeah, there you go. We got
someone who knows them there.

997
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:30,581
Good. Study hard.
Don't become an actor.

998
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,879
Well, maybe I'll take
the kids outside.

999
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,359
No, sweetie. Don't, no, no,
no one's going anywhere.

1000
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:37,039
Yeah, I think maybe
it's time to take them.

1001
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,919
It's fine when you're
playing around in college.

1002
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,264
But sooner or later you have
to provide for your family.

1003
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,669
You're gonna need those times tables.

1004
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,999
Well, maybe Tucker will have a wife

1005
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,279
who loves him and supports him.

1006
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,919
And will remind him of the answer
if he occasionally forgets.

1007
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:56,390
Maybe he'll marry someone
that enables his fantasies.

1008
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,999
Lets him sit around waiting
for a dream to come true

1009
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,788
while his children sit dumbfounded
by the edge of a muddy pool.

1010
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,302
Grace can't even swim,
for God's sakes.

1011
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:14,679
Um, grandpa,
I found something for you.

1012
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,079
Something that you're gonna need.

1013
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:19,470
What, my angel, my hope?

1014
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,759
What the hell am I gonna
do with welder's goggles?

1015
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,547
Well, here, put them on.

1016
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,999
You look good.

1017
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,959
Now, when you head into the white
light, you won't have to squint.

1018
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:41,146
So you can find Grandma.

1019
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,359
Guys, that was fantastic.

1020
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,861
Why don't you take a break?

1021
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,399
Terrific job.

1022
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,239
It was beautiful, you guys.

1023
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,469
- Really nice.
- Thanks.

1024
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,919
I'm not here to convert.

1025
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:15,263
Good, 'cause I've
already met my quota.

1026
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,185
Have a seat.

1027
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:24,399
You know, I was kosher
until I was 13.

1028
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,679
Really?

1029
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:26,919
Yeah.

1030
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:31,948
Yeah. My father told me that I was
officially a man at my Bar Mitzvah.

1031
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,439
So I told him that, as a man,

1032
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:37,079
I wanted to have a bacon
double cheeseburger.

1033
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,628
I think I saw his head explode.

1034
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:44,159
But to his credit, he let me eat

1035
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:47,311
whatever I wanted outside the house.

1036
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,991
I think I impressed
him with my logic.

1037
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:56,302
What brings you to temple, Aidan?

1038
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,959
When we were kids, my brother and I

1039
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,639
used to pretend we were these

1040
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,620
superhero space-men.

1041
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,039
We'd go out to the
woods behind our house

1042
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:10,279
and pretend it was
this mystical planet

1043
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:13,590
and we were the only ones
who could save everybody.

1044
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,706
But I've been thinking
about that a lot lately.

1045
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:23,839
Remembering those fantasies
for the first time in, like,

1046
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,479
14 years.

1047
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,186
What do you think it means?

1048
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,479
I don't know. And I'm even
embarrassed to say this out loud,

1049
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,506
but if I can't say it to you,
I can't say it to anybody.

1050
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:36,910
Do you think

1051
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:42,065
God is trying to tell me something?

1052
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,679
Trying to guide me in some way?

1053
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:50,185
And if you say He works in mysterious
ways, I will run out that door.

1054
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,869
Do you feel any spiritual
connection at all to anything?

1055
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,865
Infinity.

1056
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,279
Looking up at the sky with my kids

1057
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,879
and trying to explain to them
that it goes on forever.

1058
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:10,509
I do feel a spirituality in that.

1059
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,959
Could that be God?

1060
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:18,861
God can be whatever
you want him to be.

1061
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,039
You're getting tangled in semantics.

1062
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,919
Try not to get caught up in the
God who wants you to be kosher,

1063
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,741
and the God who wants
you to study the Torah.

1064
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:31,719
Start with God as
the infinite universe,

1065
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,279
and imagine that that force may be

1066
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,399
trying desperately to guide you

1067
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:39,905
through the most challenging
part of your life.

1068
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:44,750
Even if it has to appear to you
in the form of a space-man

1069
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,630
to get you to listen.

1070
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:01,519
Why does Grandpa have baby jellyfish?

1071
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,319
Those aren't jellyfish, buddy.

1072
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:06,879
Believe it or not,
those are contact lenses.

1073
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:10,999
Your grandpa saved all the
contact lenses he ever wore.

1074
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,119
Why?

1075
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:14,439
He said he just couldn't
bear to throw them out

1076
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,942
'cause it's everything he ever saw.

1077
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:18,999
It's weird, right?

1078
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,559
I know, but it's kinda
good-weird. I like it.

1079
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:23,679
Well, he must have
seen a lot of stuff.

1080
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,799
He did. If you think about it,
all those years,

1081
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:29,079
all the things that he saw with
his eyes through those lenses.

1082
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:32,439
Also, before he retired,
he was a microbiology professor.

1083
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:33,759
What's that?

1084
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,199
That's someone who studies things

1085
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,359
you can only see with a microscope.

1086
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:41,103
So, really, really,
really tiny things. Hey!

1087
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,879
I know the albums are fascinating,

1088
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,359
but I could use a little help
getting this place set up

1089
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:48,340
so it's nice and cozy for
when Grandpa comes home.

1090
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,380
So, if Grandpa's dying,
then why is he coming home?

1091
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:55,919
Because we don't want Grandpa
to be alone in a scary hospital.

1092
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,959
We want him to come home and
be with his family, be with us.

1093
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:03,101
So we're making him all cozy so
he's happy when he meets God?

1094
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:05,981
Yeah.

1095
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:12,319
Whoa! When did Grandpa
have this cool car?

1096
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,879
Look at that thing.

1097
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:19,669
That, my friends, is a '62 Cadillac.
Look at those fins.

1098
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,468
Look how happy he was, huh?

1099
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:24,239
Why, this was taken at a dealership.

1100
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,151
He could never afford that car.

1101
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:27,599
That sucks.

1102
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,226
It does suck.

1103
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,511
It's cool.

1104
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:37,679
Hello. Welcome to Aston Martin.

1105
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:41,679
Hello. Um, my name is Marco

1106
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:46,310
and I work for Sean "Puff
Daddy" "Dirty Money" Combs.

1107
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,599
Um, these are Puffy's children,

1108
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:51,199
and he's asked me to
come in and test drive

1109
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,590
the new Aston Martin DB9 Volante.

1110
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,839
Can I talk to you for a second?

1111
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,119
Of course.

1112
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:59,319
Please, come right here.

1113
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:00,901
Be good, children.

1114
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:02,879
I know what you're thinking.

1115
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,428
"Why are Puffy's kids white?"

1116
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,439
Valid question.

1117
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,519
Well, so many celebrities were
going and adopting black children.

1118
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:11,919
- You know what he went and did?
- Mmm-mmm.

1119
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:15,549
He went to Switzerland and adopted
these two skim-milk popsicles.

1120
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,359
Tucker! Do not.
Tucker, it's not funny.

1121
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:19,799
I know what you're trying to do.

1122
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:20,879
You do?

1123
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,479
Do you know how many
people walk in here

1124
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,719
and try to sweet-talk their way into

1125
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,559
test-driving one of these bad boys?

1126
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:29,904
- So annoying.
- Hey! I never fall for it.

1127
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:36,469
But I can see your daughter's sick.

1128
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:40,719
So, you know what?
I'm gonna make an exception.

1129
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,199
And you don't even
look good in the wig.

1130
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,559
So take it off, like, seriously.

1131
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:45,039
- No way.
- It's my wig.

1132
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:47,110
She is sick, isn't she?

1133
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:51,199
Have some respect.

1134
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,031
- So sick.
- Mmm...

1135
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,919
Okay, attendance.

1136
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,239
- Grace.
- Here!

1137
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,504
- Tucker.
- Here.

1138
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,759
- What's your name?
- Anthony.

1139
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,119
Anthony's here, too, Dad.

1140
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:05,359
All right, Anthony.
Welcome to our classroom.

1141
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:07,519
Now, kids, unless
you're on the Autobahn,

1142
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:10,079
you're never gonna get a
car like this up to speed.

1143
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,879
So in a city like LA,

1144
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,559
it's really about what it sounds like

1145
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:15,239
when you floor it from a full stop.

1146
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:17,559
Yes, but, kids, we're on
Robertson Boulevard.

1147
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,199
So there will be no flooring it

1148
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,119
from a full stop, will there be?

1149
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,588
- No, sir.
- Thank you.

1150
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:09,471
Did I scare you?

1151
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,759
I thought if I ever
saw you here alone,

1152
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:15,183
you'd be putting a
pillow over my face.

1153
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:16,999
I looked.

1154
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,919
You're lying on the
only two in the room.

1155
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,759
I've been watching the paramedics

1156
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:23,239
come and go for the last half-hour.

1157
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:25,639
And every few minutes
they race in at full speed

1158
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:27,639
doing everything they can
to save someone's life

1159
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:30,359
and then a few minutes later,

1160
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:33,511
they all walk outside
and smoke cigarettes.

1161
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:39,799
You never really think about
death until you're here.

1162
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:45,119
Chemicals pumping into your veins
while you watch Maury Povich.

1163
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:47,941
I'm unclear which one
is killing me faster.

1164
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:50,599
Can I offer you some saline?

1165
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:53,439
I'm glad to see you're
keeping your sense of humor.

1166
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,544
What else am I supposed to do?

1167
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,719
Eventually things get tragic enough

1168
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,904
and they circle back to comedy.

1169
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:03,703
Yeah.

1170
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:09,385
You know, I don't think
I ever told you this,

1171
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:16,030
but when I lost my sister, you were
the most helpful person to me.

1172
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:18,144
- Really?
- Yeah.

1173
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:23,183
I mean, I'm glad if I was, but I
don't even remember what I said.

1174
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:26,391
You said,

1175
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:30,399
"Nothing in life will call upon
us to be more courageous

1176
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,359
"than facing the fact that it ends.

1177
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:36,989
"But on the other side of
heartbreak is wisdom."

1178
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:39,439
I said that?

1179
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,101
Yeah.

1180
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,751
That was good advice.

1181
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:49,346
And now here I am,
a shiva waiting to happen.

1182
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:53,104
Well, the wisdom that came out for me

1183
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:58,421
was that the things left
unsaid stay with us forever.

1184
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:03,279
I wish nothing more

1185
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:06,386
than if I could tell my
sister how much I loved her

1186
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,507
and that I always idolized her.

1187
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,359
But we never said those things.

1188
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:14,067
We just weren't like that.

1189
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:20,589
And suddenly one day she's gone.

1190
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:30,519
And I have all these things to say,

1191
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:32,306
but no one to say them to.

1192
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,319
Both my boys know how I feel.

1193
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,504
Are you sure, Gabe?

1194
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:50,145
I told them I wanted to retire.

1195
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:53,151
I lied.

1196
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,624
They pushed me out.

1197
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:04,584
'Cause I wasn't keeping
up with technology.

1198
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:10,421
Don't let anyone push them out.

1199
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,999
Have you told them this?

1200
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,025
What is this?

1201
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,862
Is this an intervention?

1202
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:20,479
Did you come here to tell
me how I failed as a father?

1203
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:22,141
No!

1204
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:28,627
Not at all. You've raised
two incredible boys, Gabe.

1205
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:31,079
They may not have quick answers

1206
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:33,947
or awards on their mantles.

1207
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:38,384
In fact, neither one
of them has a mantle.

1208
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,264
But they're incredible,

1209
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,466
with big, sensitive hearts.

1210
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,439
And right now they need to know

1211
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:51,863
how much their father loves them.

1212
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:00,747
Barbara used to help you with
the hard part of parenting, right?

1213
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:06,708
She made everyone around her happy.

1214
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,982
She just brought out the best in me.

1215
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:21,759
I think if she were here right
now she'd tell you that

1216
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:25,548
your boys will remember this
time for the rest of their lives.

1217
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:33,020
It will shape who they are as men.

1218
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:44,151
You're gonna make a great
matriarch one day.

1219
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:54,945
I already am a great matriarch, Gabe.

1220
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:08,468
At least I'm working on it.

1221
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:18,799
Today, we are going to Mr. Miyagi
the shit out of this fence.

1222
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,159
Who's Mr. Miyagi?

1223
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:22,639
Mr. Miyagi is an older Asian man

1224
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,824
that taught me many life lessons.

1225
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,079
The point is I'm sick of
looking at this fence.

1226
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,599
Today we're gonna fix it.

1227
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,959
Tucker, where's your drill?

1228
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,303
- It's under my pillow.
- Please go get it.

1229
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:36,301
- Whoo-hoo!
- Okay, Grace, come up here.

1230
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,039
Hop on the diving board.

1231
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,666
Okay.

1232
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,199
You are going to recite this poem

1233
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:46,384
while Tucker and I work on the fence.

1234
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:48,399
Then we'll switch.

1235
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,839
This is weird.

1236
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:54,186
Think of it as a prayer you're
not expecting anyone to answer.

1237
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:57,879
All right, Tuck, good.
Come over here. Put the drill down.

1238
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:59,999
We're gonna use it later
when we put 'em back up.

1239
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,519
Come over here with this crowbar.

1240
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:06,119
And the point is to jam it in
here and then use your leverage.

1241
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:07,719
Slide your arms down. Yeah!

1242
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:09,599
Oh! You're a natural at this.

1243
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:13,229
Next up, we're gonna
re-plaster that pool.

1244
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:18,479
"Something there is that
doesn't love a wall

1245
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:22,039
"That sends the
frozen-ground-swell under it

1246
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:25,384
"And spills the upper
boulders in the sun

1247
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:28,559
"I let my neighbor
know beyond the hill

1248
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:31,159
"And on a day we
meet to walk the line

1249
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:34,391
"And set the wall
between us once again

1250
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:38,319
"Before I built a
wall I'd ask to know

1251
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,743
"What I was walling in or walling out

1252
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:43,707
"And to whom I was
like to give offense

1253
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:48,343
"Something there is
that doesn't love a wall

1254
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:51,269
"That wants it down"

1255
01:11:58,200 --> 01:11:59,781
Hey.

1256
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:03,380
- That's a load of colors.
- Uh-huh.

1257
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,941
What's going on back there?

1258
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,349
I'm comforting you.

1259
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:23,711
You've been going
through a lot lately.

1260
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:26,064
Thank you, baby.

1261
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:29,505
I really need to be
comforted right now.

1262
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:40,146
Good night all the moonlight ladies

1263
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:45,865
Rock-a-bye sweet baby James

1264
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:52,386
Deep greens and blues
are the colors I choose

1265
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:57,784
Won't you let me go
down in my dreams?

1266
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:03,581
And rock-a-bye sweet baby James

1267
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:16,519
Where are the kids?

1268
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:17,959
They're plastering the pool.

1269
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:20,064
Aidan!

1270
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,959
I'm on a break.
They don't deserve a break.

1271
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:25,303
They need to work harder.

1272
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:29,588
This is the little hand that took
so long to plaster anything.

1273
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:34,945
I missed you.

1274
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,719
What do you mean you missed me?
I've been right here.

1275
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:39,984
No, you haven't been.

1276
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:43,501
I haven't seen you in a while.

1277
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:48,461
But I'm glad you're here, Mr. Bloom.

1278
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:29,559
I am Khaleesi, Queen of the Dragons.

1279
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:31,710
You are Khaleesi

1280
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:35,559
and I am the brown guy who died.

1281
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:41,107
I can't remember my name,
but I think it might be Drago.

1282
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,750
This is awesome.

1283
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:48,744
I've never heard of post-sex
role-playing, but I like it.

1284
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:56,919
I have to tell you something,

1285
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:59,502
and I don't want you to go crazy.

1286
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:03,266
What?

1287
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:10,067
It's all under control,

1288
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:14,584
but I just feel like it's
something you should be aware of.

1289
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:18,421
Sarah, what?

1290
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:21,759
You know that guy Jerry

1291
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,989
that I share my cubicle with at work?

1292
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,501
Yeah?

1293
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,106
He's been acting kind
of inappropriate lately.

1294
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:32,959
Is he, like, trying to
touch you or something?

1295
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:35,781
No, no, no, nothing like that.

1296
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:40,630
It's more like doing stuff like

1297
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:44,029
making his penis talk.

1298
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:46,759
Are you fucking kidding me?

1299
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:49,119
Honey, honey, calm down.

1300
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:50,719
Well, did you talk to
Human Resources?

1301
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:55,430
I talked to my boss and he
told me to sing Hakuna Matata.

1302
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:58,346
Are you...

1303
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:01,959
Where does he live?
I'll go fucking talk to him.

1304
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:04,279
I don't need my husband
to come to my rescue.

1305
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:05,439
I can handle this.

1306
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,279
I feel like I should, like,
I have to talk to him.

1307
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:08,399
I wanna fucking kill him.

1308
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,479
You can't.

1309
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:11,319
I can't believe you're just
telling me about this now.

1310
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:15,142
Honey. I told you I didn't
want you to go crazy.

1311
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:25,221
Hey, hey. Hi, George.

1312
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:26,759
Hey, Dad.

1313
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:27,999
Yes.

1314
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,346
Hey. Oh, your lips
are so chapped, Dad.

1315
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:36,030
Here's some ice.
George is slacking on you.

1316
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:40,868
There you go. There you go.

1317
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:44,866
Much better. That feel good?

1318
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:50,159
Remember when that ice cream truck

1319
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:52,239
would come around
when you were little?

1320
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:53,319
Yeah.

1321
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:56,903
You and Noah would hear
the music and light up.

1322
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:01,626
And the three of us would chase
after him till he stopped.

1323
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,704
Were there fireflies?

1324
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,199
I can't remember.

1325
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:11,863
Dad, you know there's no
fireflies in Los Angeles.

1326
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,424
I wanna remember it with fireflies.

1327
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:21,119
What was that I always
used to get? I forgot.

1328
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:23,679
Your favorite was the toasted almond.

1329
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:24,999
- Toasted almond.
- Yes, sir.

1330
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,119
I'll have one of those.

1331
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:27,621
Okay.

1332
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:31,180
That's the last thing
I wanna taste, Aidan.

1333
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:36,230
Okay, you got a deal.
I'll bring it to you.

1334
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:41,026
Wouldn't it be great if your
brother could be there, too?

1335
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:45,820
That would be great, Dad.
That would be really, really great.

1336
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,504
You promise me.

1337
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:51,399
Promise me you'll try
to make that happen.

1338
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,311
Yeah. I...

1339
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:55,944
I need to see him.

1340
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:58,944
I wanna make amends.

1341
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:08,425
I promise.

1342
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,831
I promise you.

1343
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:17,311
Okay.

1344
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,467
Get some sleep.
Why don't you take a nap?

1345
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,799
Let me lead the way, Captain.

1346
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:31,302
Let me lead the way, Captain.

1347
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:34,959
Let me... These Ractonians.
It's Ractonian.

1348
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,879
Let me lead the way, Captain.

1349
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:40,463
These Ractonians could
be hiding anywhere.

1350
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:45,479
I'm sorry to bother you,
have you seen this show?

1351
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:47,982
No one's seen this show.

1352
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:50,519
It's an insult to sci-fi.

1353
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:53,079
Captain Kirk's probably
turning over in his grave.

1354
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:55,559
Well, technically Captain
Kirk isn't even born

1355
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:58,540
until 2233, but that's irrelevant.

1356
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,479
Sorry, I'm a bit of an aficionado

1357
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:05,268
and this dog shit is the reason
the genre gets no respect.

1358
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:08,822
Let me lead the way, Captain.

1359
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:11,429
Can I give you one thought, though?

1360
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:12,999
Sure.

1361
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,799
- I don't mean to be presumptuous at all.
- No. Yeah.

1362
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:18,065
But I just was listening to
you and I just thought...

1363
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:20,999
You're the first one off the ship.

1364
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,239
You don't even have a name.

1365
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:25,519
Okay, now we don't
have the whole script,

1366
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,679
but the guy has two
lines in the first act

1367
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:31,184
and he's gonna be the
first one off the ship.

1368
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:33,239
He's gonna die.

1369
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:34,519
Of course he's gonna die!

1370
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,679
He's seconds away from getting
his whole head blown off

1371
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:39,626
by a bunch of Ractonians, okay?

1372
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:41,239
So, just factor that in.

1373
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:43,359
- Amp up the fear a little bit.
- Right.

1374
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:47,023
This is probably the single
scariest moment of

1375
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:50,679
- Random Crew Member Number One's life.
- Absolutely.

1376
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:52,239
So, there's nothing
cavalier about it.

1377
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:55,550
- No. Right. Right.
- He's focused and terrified.

1378
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:58,222
- Thank you.
- Sure, just...

1379
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:00,759
Why are you helping me?

1380
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:01,879
I have no idea.

1381
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:04,559
It makes no sense, but,
you know, whatever.

1382
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:05,919
Careful, it could be kindness.

1383
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:10,039
Oh, God, I hope not. I'll get
eaten alive in this town.

1384
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:54,863
His outfit's amazing.

1385
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:57,348
That's his first costume?

1386
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:06,781
Yeah.

1387
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,439
Replacing your own pool filter

1388
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,999
is challenging, but a lot of fun.

1389
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,719
One thing's for certain.
You're gonna need some skilled helpers.

1390
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,599
That's really good, buddy.

1391
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:30,661
Yeah, get all that gross stuff off.
You're doing awesome.

1392
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,106
Hello?

1393
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:40,383
Yeah, yeah, put him on.

1394
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:45,426
Dad? Are you okay?

1395
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:52,991
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
I'm coming. I'm coming right now.

1396
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:55,310
Was that Grandpa?

1397
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:58,828
He wants me to bring
him a toasted almond.

1398
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,670
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

1399
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:07,799
I'm so glad we're neighbors.

1400
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:11,399
Yeah?

1401
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:12,919
I thought you might want to know

1402
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:15,959
that your father might pass
away at any moment now.

1403
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:17,825
I think you should come home.

1404
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:22,746
What's wrong?

1405
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:27,119
I've been talking to him a lot,
Noah, and he wants to apologize.

1406
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:29,539
He wants to make amends,
he wants to make things right.

1407
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,159
We've been over this, Aidan.

1408
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:34,628
Look, I've been thinking and...

1409
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:39,703
Maybe you don't realize this
until you have kids of your own,

1410
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:42,559
but being a father is really hard.

1411
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:45,039
Look, uh, Aidan, I gotta go.

1412
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,199
Please, Noah.

1413
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:47,279
Let me talk to him.

1414
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,270
- Not now, sweetie.
- No.

1415
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:50,781
Uncle Noah?

1416
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:52,879
Hi, it's Grace.

1417
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:55,223
Did Janine like the costume?

1418
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:57,679
Did she give you some poontang?

1419
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:00,319
Uh, yeah, she sure did.

1420
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:04,791
Uncle Noah, I've never asked
you for anything, have I?

1421
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:06,039
No.

1422
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:11,068
I didn't get mad when you
forgot my birthday or Hanukkah

1423
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:13,439
or that time you got drunk
and peed in my closet.

1424
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:16,799
Uh, well, Grace,
I got locked in there.

1425
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,559
Somebody locked me in there.

1426
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:21,062
I want you to come see Grandpa.

1427
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,865
Are you okay?

1428
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:33,591
Grace, um, can I tell you a secret?

1429
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,620
Yeah.

1430
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:41,103
I'm scared.

1431
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:49,906
Losing my mom was the hardest
thing I've ever been through.

1432
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:54,986
I don't know if I can take it again.

1433
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:59,308
I know that you're sad.

1434
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:04,264
But we're sad, too.

1435
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:10,307
And we should all be together.

1436
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:18,340
Listen.

1437
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:22,908
I know that you don't believe in God.

1438
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:28,869
But maybe you can believe in family.

1439
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:33,664
Uncle Noah?

1440
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:45,719
He hung up.

1441
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:47,506
What?

1442
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:51,865
Maybe we got disconnected.

1443
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:56,827
But it kind of felt like he hung up.

1444
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,351
Here it is.

1445
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:10,319
Dad, I think I see the guy who
sits next to Mommy at work.

1446
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:13,664
No. Did you ever hear
of the drink Kefir?

1447
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:15,719
Sounds gross.

1448
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:18,382
It isn't. Well,
I'm gonna get a Kefir.

1449
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,399
Okay, hold this.
I'm gonna go talk to him.

1450
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,359
Dad, not now. Grandpa!

1451
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:36,783
It's only gonna take a second.

1452
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:41,146
Are you into any of these products?

1453
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:42,359
I don't drink dairy.

1454
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:43,719
You don't drink dairy?

1455
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:45,519
How do you get all your protein?

1456
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:46,559
Vegetables.

1457
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:50,079
Don't take veggies. You never
had cream in your coffee?

1458
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:51,759
Depends on the cream.

1459
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:53,559
Don't you like your cake
with frosting on it?

1460
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:54,679
I do.

1461
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:56,919
Wouldn't you like
a milky, like, sweet,

1462
01:25:56,920 --> 01:26:00,039
like, strawberry kind of,
you know, yogurt?

1463
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:02,599
Excuse me, are you Jerry?

1464
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:04,759
The guy with the talking dick?

1465
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:08,879
Yeah. I told you.
Who the hell are you?

1466
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:12,359
My name is Aidan Bloom.
I'm Sarah's husband.

1467
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:13,479
Oh!

1468
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:15,239
Oh, hey.

1469
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:17,742
How you doing? Nice to meet you.

1470
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:19,959
I have been racking my brain trying

1471
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:22,439
to figure out how to
handle this situation.

1472
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:24,510
Situation?

1473
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:28,639
If you ever so much as
exhale near my wife again,

1474
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:31,079
I promise to sue you
for sexual harassment.

1475
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:36,108
Stay away from my wife,
you wretched piece of shit.

1476
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:51,159
Dad?

1477
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:54,399
That did not go as planned.

1478
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:55,599
Are you okay?

1479
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,119
I think you lost, Dad.

1480
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:59,270
Here, put this on your eye.

1481
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:04,189
We gotta go. Come on.

1482
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:09,919
Hey.

1483
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:12,479
Honey, oh, my God!
What happened to your eye?

1484
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:15,119
I ran into Jerry at the supermarket.

1485
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:17,349
Oh, my God.

1486
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:20,719
Hey, Dad, I'm here.

1487
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:25,589
Look, I'm here. Toasted almond.

1488
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:34,519
What happened to your eye?

1489
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:37,319
Oh. Don't worry about it, Dad.

1490
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:38,639
Don't worry about that at all.

1491
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:40,679
The point is I'm here, okay?

1492
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:44,039
I'm here and Sarah's here
and the kids are here.

1493
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:47,559
And the rabbis are here
and we all love you.

1494
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:50,279
I'm sorry, I don't think
Noah's gonna make it, Dad.

1495
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:52,350
I did everything I could.

1496
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,301
Hmm.

1497
01:28:57,640 --> 01:28:59,744
Thank you, Aidan.

1498
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:02,344
For what, Dad?

1499
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:10,104
For doing your best to hold this
family together when I couldn't.

1500
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:17,428
How did you get that shiner?

1501
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:22,870
I ran into someone who's been
harassing Sarah at work.

1502
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:25,191
So, yes.

1503
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:28,509
You went after him, huh?

1504
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:32,830
I tried.

1505
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:36,704
That takes guts.

1506
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:39,825
Good for you.

1507
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:43,109
You showed up.

1508
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:49,545
How are you feeling?

1509
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:54,069
I'm not afraid.

1510
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:57,869
Isn't that funny?

1511
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:01,542
I thought I'd be afraid.

1512
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:05,943
I think that's the bravest
thing I've ever heard.

1513
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:11,223
- Really?
- Yeah, I really do.

1514
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:14,039
You promise?

1515
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:15,666
I promise you.

1516
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:30,519
Do you see that

1517
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:33,785
or is God very different
than I imagined?

1518
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:40,028
Noah! That's Noah, Dad. You made it?

1519
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:43,546
Dad, it's Noah. He made it.

1520
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,743
Noah, you're a warrior.

1521
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:03,628
No, I just won a contest.

1522
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:09,144
But you won.

1523
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:12,545
Yeah.

1524
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,264
Yeah, Dad, I won.

1525
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:19,068
I'm so proud of you.

1526
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:25,982
I'm so tired.

1527
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,184
Hold my hands.

1528
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:40,545
Right here. Right here, Dad.

1529
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:42,745
We love you.

1530
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:48,304
If there's a next time,
I'll do better.

1531
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:52,110
So fast.

1532
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:57,904
Try to remember how fast it goes.

1533
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:04,910
When we were kids, Noah and I used
to pretend that we were heroes

1534
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:10,748
with swords, the only ones
who could save the day.

1535
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,504
But perhaps we set
the bar a little bit high.

1536
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:21,866
Maybe we're just the regular people.

1537
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:24,862
The ones who get saved.

1538
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:47,079
Hey!

1539
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:48,359
Oh, my God!

1540
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:52,359
Dude! This is because of you.
I got that part.

1541
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:54,079
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah.

1542
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:55,719
They fucked you up.

1543
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:57,119
Yeah, no, you were totally right.

1544
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,519
Soon as I get off the ship,
there's fucking Ractonians everywhere.

1545
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:00,679
I got crushed.

1546
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:02,999
By the way, what's your name?

1547
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,399
- I'm Aidan.
- Hey, I'm Paul.

1548
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,719
- Nice to meet you.
- No, thank you again for that note.

1549
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:09,621
I was just talking about you in a
meeting. I didn't have your number.

1550
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:13,119
I work with this little
theater company in Topanga.

1551
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:15,588
Have you ever given any
thought to teaching?

1552
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,279
Not... No, no.

1553
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:20,279
Well, look, we have these
classes for college kids

1554
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:21,559
and we're looking for somebody new.

1555
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:25,269
The pay is just okay,
but the people are amazing.

1556
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:27,584
You should come by
and give it a look.

1557
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:29,479
- Really?
- Yeah.

1558
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:31,599
They'd love you. Would you come by?

1559
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:32,879
That'd be really cool.
I'd be honored.

1560
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:34,599
- Really? You'll come?
- Yeah.

1561
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:35,999
I'd give you my number, but I doubt

1562
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,319
you have a phone
in your little onesie.

1563
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:40,039
Yeah, no, I don't, but I've
got places I can put things.

1564
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:42,199
- All right, let's do it.
- My trailer's right here.

1565
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:43,599
- Will you come with me just two seconds?
- Of course.

1566
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:45,101
- Yeah, thank you.
- Wonderful.

1567
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:47,159
The Blooms are willing to drop both

1568
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:49,999
the sexual harassment and
public-battery charges

1569
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:55,791
as long as we give her a year's
paid salary and you agree to this.

1570
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:59,279
Ostensibly, it's a sexual
harassment workshop.

1571
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:02,079
The Blooms are adamant
that you need to attend.

1572
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:03,839
What the hell is this?

1573
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:06,639
Well, it's typically a
three-month course,

1574
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:10,079
but the Blooms are insisting
that you take it seven times.

1575
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:13,823
Oh! Also, you're fired.

1576
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,559
- Hi.
- Hello.

1577
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:23,999
Are the Gilberts home?

1578
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,679
Nobody home.

1579
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:27,319
Oh, it's okay. I'm a
friend of the Gilberts

1580
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:31,870
and they asked me to come by and fix
the drain at the bottom of their pool.

1581
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,839
But I'm leaving.

1582
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:37,839
Oh, that's okay. I'll close the
gate behind me. Thank you.

1583
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:39,990
Mmm, AC feels good.

1584
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:45,839
Dad, this is so embarrassing.

1585
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:49,479
Don't worry. The Gilberts
are in St. Tropez all spring.

1586
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:51,839
It's their own fault for bragging.

1587
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:54,319
Now before I let school
out for the semester,

1588
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:57,471
we're gonna get you
ready for Jesse's party.

1589
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:03,799
I'm scared.

1590
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:05,347
I know.

1591
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:07,431
I want you to jump in.

1592
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:10,319
But I don't know
anything about swimming.

1593
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:14,029
I know, sweetheart. I want you to
jump in. I'm gonna be here for you.

1594
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:17,519
If I die, I'm gonna
be so pissed at you.

1595
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:19,465
We have a deal.

1596
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:26,385
Do it. Go for it.

1597
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:28,746
What lady is that, which doth
enrich the hand of yonder knight?
