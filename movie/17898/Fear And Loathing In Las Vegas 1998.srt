00:05:06,007 --> 00:05:07,382
Can you hear me?

158
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,717
Good.

159
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:09,927
很好

160

(EXCLAIMS)
I want you to have
all the background.

161
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,966
我必须跟你说清楚

162
00:05:12,013 --> 00:05:13,972
This is a very
ominous assignment

163
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,469
这是份苦差事…

164
00:05:14,056 --> 00:05:16,224
with overtones
of extreme personal danger.

165
00:05:15,572 --> 00:05:17,435
需要冒很大的险

166
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:18,226
I'm a Doctor of Journalism,
man.

167
00:05:17,573 --> 00:05:20,233
我是一名新闻学博士
这很重要，妈的！

168
00:05:18,311 --> 00:05:20,562
This is important,
goddamn it!
This is a fucking true story!

169
00:05:20,377 --> 00:05:22,639
这可是真的

170
00:05:20,646 --> 00:05:23,606
Shit! Hey, what're you doing?
Sit down. Get the fuck. . .

171
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:24,836
他妈的-

172
00:05:24,317 --> 00:05:26,651
Get your hands
off my fucking head !

173
00:05:24,981 --> 00:05:27,504
不要扯我的头发

174
00:05:26,736 --> 00:05:27,777
Now, now, now.

175
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:31,550
-冷静，冷静
-我们没法心灵相通
但这是为什么呢？

DUKE NARRATING: Our vibrations
were getting nasty, but why?

177
00:05:31,032 --> 00:05:32,907
Was there no communication
in this car?

178
00:05:31,687 --> 00:05:34,052
难道这辆车上的人
没有交际能力？

179
00:05:33,576 --> 00:05:36,036
Had we deteriorated
to the level of dumb beasts?

180
00:05:34,188 --> 00:05:37,053
我们不可能退化到
跟兽类一样了吧？

181
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,788
I want you to understand
that this man at the wheel
is my attorney.

182
00:05:37,191 --> 00:05:39,556
开车的那个是我的律师

183
00:05:38,873 --> 00:05:40,832
He's not just some dingbat
I found on the Strip, man.

184
00:05:39,694 --> 00:05:43,093
他可不是我随随便便
从斯德帕那个地方找来的傻子
他是个外地人

185
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,334
He's a foreigner.

186
00:05:42,418 --> 00:05:44,002
I think he's probably Samoan.

187
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:46,754
我猜他应该是萨摩亚人吧
这个可没什么关系，是吧？

188
00:05:44,128 --> 00:05:45,879
It doesn't matter,
though, does it?

189
00:05:46,505 --> 00:05:47,505
Are you prejudiced?

190
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:49,298
-你有种族偏见吗？
-不，不，没有

191
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,590
Hell, no.

192
00:05:48,674 --> 00:05:50,091
I didn't think so.

193
00:05:49,402 --> 00:05:51,265
我想不是吧

194
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:53,887
Because in spite of his race,
this man is extremely valuable
to me.

195
00:05:51,404 --> 00:05:54,770
除了他的血缘关系以外
对我来说，他还是非常重要的

196
00:05:53,971 --> 00:05:56,306
Oh, shit.
I forgot about the beer.
You want some?

197
00:05:54,908 --> 00:05:58,274
-妈的.我忘了我还拿着啤酒
你要来一点吗？-不用了

198
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,349
No.

199
00:05:57,433 --> 00:05:58,600
How about some ether?

200
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:00,500
-那要来点感情催化剂吗？
-什么？

201
00:05:58,809 --> 00:05:59,851
What?

202
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:03,688
Never mind.
All right, let's get right
to the heart of this thing.

203
00:06:00,645 --> 00:06:01,508
好了，没什么
我们现在切入正题吧

204

named Lacerda.

is check into my

As your attorney,
I advise you

252
00:07:08,705 --> 00:07:11,797
作为你的律师，我建议你
去租一辆高速的无顶蓬的车

00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:10,422
to rent a very fast car
with no top.

00:21:08,469 --> 00:21:10,298
妈的

783
00:21:08,677 --> 00:21:11,178
Holy shit. Oh, my God.

784
00:21:10,438 --> 00:21:12,301
我的上帝

785
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:13,931
(MAN CONTINUES
CHATTERING ON T.V.)

786
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:18,185
Hi. I'm Lacerda,
your photographer.

787
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:19,177
嗨，我是拉喀达
你们的摄影师

788
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,979
杜克？

789
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,234
Duke?
DUKE: Mmm-hmm.

790
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,981
在那后边

791
00:21:26,361 --> 00:21:27,653
Back there.

792
00:21:27,946 --> 00:21:29,113
Duke?

793
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:31,143
-北越看起来似乎想-
-杜克？杜克？

794
00:21:29,823 --> 00:21:31,240
Duke? Hi !

795
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:33,152
嗨

796
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:32,324
(LAUGHS)

797
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:35,035
Lacerda. Your photographer.

798
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,757
拉喀达，你们的摄影师

799
00:21:35,287 --> 00:21:36,829
You're not Portuguese, man !

800
00:21:35,893 --> 00:21:37,756
你不是葡萄牙人，老兄

801
00:21:36,913 --> 00:21:39,665
Hey, too bad you guys
missed the bikes checking in.

802
00:21:37,894 --> 00:21:40,655
真可怜，你们错过了
这场比赛的开幕式

803
00:21:39,749 --> 00:21:41,709
Oh, man, what a sight!

804
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:42,661
啊，那可真壮观

805
00:21:41,793 --> 00:21:45,713
Husquavarnas, Yamahas, DMZs.

806
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,631
-越野摩托，亚马哈车，DMZs车

807
00:21:46,756 --> 00:21:48,465
Kawasakis!

808
00:21:47,236 --> 00:21:49,202
川畸车

809
00:21:48,591 --> 00:21:51,302
Maicos. Pursang !

810
00:21:49,371 --> 00:21:51,998
-麦克斯车.帕甚车

811
00:21:51,386 --> 00:21:53,429
Swedish Fireballs.

812
00:21:52,174 --> 00:21:54,664
雅典燃烧弹

813
00:21:54,139 --> 00:21:56,765
Couple of Triumphs.
Here and there a CZ.

814
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:57,175
两辆胜利牌车
到处都是CZ车

815
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:59,268
All very, very fast.

816
00:21:57,311 --> 00:21:59,676
它们都非常快

817
00:21:59,811 --> 00:22:00,894
Very.

818
00:21:59,814 --> 00:22:01,677
非常非常快

819
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:03,564
What a race it's gonna be.

820
00:22:01,816 --> 00:22:04,044
这将是一场无比精彩的比赛

821
00:22:07,187 --> 00:22:10,553
是的

822
00:22:09,237 --> 00:22:10,362
Yeah.

823
00:22:14,075 --> 00:22:16,076
I'm gonna let myself out.

824
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,523
我自己出去

825
00:22:17,245 --> 00:22:19,288
We know what
you're up to, man.
Hmm?

826
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:19,659
我们知道你想做什么，伙计

827
00:22:30,467 --> 00:22:32,301
I'm gonna tell you. . .

828
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:33,132
我要告诉你-

829
00:22:32,552 --> 00:22:36,388
He's lying to us.
I could see it in his eyes.

830
00:22:33,275 --> 00:22:36,834
他在撒谎
我从他的眼神中看出这点

831
00:22:36,639 --> 00:22:37,765
Eyes?

832
00:22:36,979 --> 00:22:38,638
眼神？

833
00:22:38,725 --> 00:22:40,559
MAN ON T.V. : Late
battle reports indicate...

834
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,838
-最近从战场发回的报道显示-

835
00:22:40,643 --> 00:22:42,686
Panic now, Charlie.

836
00:22:43,438 --> 00:22:45,105
Turn this shit off.

837
00:22:43,985 --> 00:22:46,679
关掉这鬼东西

838
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:54,114
DUKE NARRATING: The racers
were ready at dawn.

839
00:22:52,226 --> 00:22:54,659
比赛一大早就开始了

840
00:22:54,199 --> 00:22:55,616
Very tense.

841
00:22:54,828 --> 00:22:56,691
非常激烈

842
00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:00,454
ln some circles, the Mint 400
is a far, far better thing
than the Super Bowl,

843
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:00,287
从某种程度上说Mint400
远比…

844
00:23:00,467 --> 00:23:03,366
超级杯，
肯塔基赛马会…

845
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,247
the Kentucky Derby

846
00:23:02,457 --> 00:23:04,917
and the Lower Oakland
Roller Derby Finals
all rolled into one.

847
00:23:03,469 --> 00:23:06,334
奥克兰赛马会总决赛要强得多

848
00:23:05,001 --> 00:23:06,543
Hey! Slow down !
This is a restricted area!

849
00:23:06,472 --> 00:23:08,335
停下！
这里不能随便出入！

850
00:23:06,628 --> 00:23:09,046
This race attracts
a very special breed.

851
00:23:08,473 --> 00:23:10,336
这场比赛吸引了
各方各面的人来看

852
00:23:09,339 --> 00:23:11,173
Fuck off.
All right.

853
00:23:10,475 --> 00:23:12,873
-滚开
-好的

854
00:23:11,674 --> 00:23:13,801
lt was time to get grounded,

855
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:16,376
现在该四周转转
了解这里的情况…

856
00:23:14,094 --> 00:23:15,719
to ponder this
rotten assignment

857
00:23:15,804 --> 00:23:17,388
and figure out
how to cope with it.

858
00:23:16,512 --> 00:23:18,877
考虑一下如何
来做这份工作了

859
00:23:17,472 --> 00:23:18,972
lt was time to do the job.

860
00:23:19,015 --> 00:23:20,878
要开始工作了

861
00:23:20,183 --> 00:23:21,642
Those of us
who had been up all night

862
00:23:21,017 --> 00:23:24,883
像我们这种彻夜不眠的人
早餐不需咖啡和油炸饼

863
00:23:21,726 --> 00:23:23,560
were in no mood
for coffee and donuts.

864
00:23:24,229 --> 00:23:26,188
We wanted strong drink.

865
00:23:25,021 --> 00:23:27,283
我们需要的是一些烈酒

866
00:23:26,314 --> 00:23:27,898
We were, after all

867
00:23:27,456 --> 00:23:29,319
毕竟，我们是…

868
00:23:27,982 --> 00:23:30,192
the absolute cream
of the national
sporting press.

869
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:31,424
是来做体育报道的

870
00:23:30,652 --> 00:23:31,902
MAN: Pull !

871
00:23:31,593 --> 00:23:33,456
拉，放！

872
00:23:32,404 --> 00:23:33,946
We were gathered here
in Las Vegas

873
00:23:33,595 --> 00:23:36,926
我们从四面八方聚到一起来
为的就是见证体育史上
这一历史时刻

874
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,864
for this very
special moment in sport.

875
00:23:36,491 --> 00:23:39,410
When it comes to
a thing like this,
they don't fool around.

876
00:23:37,031 --> 00:23:39,896
一旦开始工作
我们就会谨慎认真

877
00:23:39,869 --> 00:23:41,120
(SNORING)

878
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,832
It's just beautiful.

879
00:23:42,536 --> 00:23:45,401
这真是太美了

880
00:23:48,253 --> 00:23:50,421
Money plays. Money plays.

881
00:23:48,942 --> 00:23:51,272
来，赌一把啦，赌一把

882
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,256
Kill the body,
the head will die.

883
00:23:51,411 --> 00:23:54,742
人死了，大脑也就会死了
阿里-弗雷泽的比赛

884
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,966
Ali-Frazier fight.

885
00:23:54,342 --> 00:23:55,592
Crazy shit, man.

886
00:23:54,881 --> 00:23:58,144
-疯子
-60年代末的一场好戏

887
00:23:55,677 --> 00:23:57,052
A proper end to the '60s.

888
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,472
Ali beaten by
a human hamburger.

889
00:23:58,284 --> 00:24:01,149
阿里输了

890
00:24:00,974 --> 00:24:02,558
Both Kennedys
murdered by mutants.

891
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:04,080
-两个肯尼迪都是被人杀死的
-比赛开始了

892
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:03,767
MAN: Hey, they're starting !

893
00:24:03,852 --> 00:24:05,436
Oh, shit, they're starting.
Let's go!

894
00:24:04,222 --> 00:24:06,085
好的，开始了，我们走

895
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,354
MAN ON P.A. :

896
00:24:06,224 --> 00:24:08,087

With a purse of $50,000
going to the winner

900
00:24:12,695 --> 00:24:15,924
本赛获胜者可得五万元…

901
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,906
of this grueling,
gut-wrenching, dust-eating,

902
00:24:16,066 --> 00:24:18,532
这是一场挑战人体极限
勇气的考验…

903
00:24:18,032 --> 00:24:20,492
in-your-face
motocross extravaganza!

904
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:21,659
一场你们最喜欢的摩托车越野赛！

We've got
rooster tails going!

我们的勇士们出发了！

909
00:24:25,807 --> 00:24:28,638
我们在这儿为他们加油吧！

910
00:24:25,832 --> 00:24:28,167
We're here to spit
in your enemy's eye!

911
00:24:28,251 --> 00:24:29,251
There they go.

912
00:24:28,777 --> 00:24:30,936
比赛开始了

913
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:34,603
好的，我们的第二组十个
参赛队员也已经做好准备了

914
00:24:31,588 --> 00:24:34,089
All right, our second group
of 1 0 is getting in place.

915
00:24:34,174 --> 00:24:36,967
Kawasakis, Triumphs, Maicos.

916
00:24:34,748 --> 00:24:37,977
川崎车，胜利车，梅科斯车

917
00:24:37,051 --> 00:24:38,969
Here we are.
We're ready to go.

918
00:24:38,152 --> 00:24:41,381
好，准备
绿旗，出发

919
00:24:39,053 --> 00:24:40,929
lt's the green flag,
and they're off!

920
00:24:41,014 --> 00:24:44,099
Another great start
with a lot of dirt
happening on this hill!

921
00:24:41,487 --> 00:24:44,648
好，第二队狂狮出发了！

922
00:24:44,184 --> 00:24:45,976
All right, here we go
with the third group.

923
00:24:44,791 --> 00:24:48,520
现在是第三队，
他们要出发了

924
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,811
And they're off!

925
00:24:47,896 --> 00:24:51,482
Here we go.
Number 45 riding in
the number 4 position

926
00:24:48,661 --> 00:24:51,594
在第四起跑线的45号…

927
00:24:51,566 --> 00:24:54,109
is choking as the dust flies!

928
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:54,357
好像被灰尘窒息了！

929
00:24:54,194 --> 00:24:57,779
You'd better wet those
bandannas you got
stretched over your face!

930
00:24:54,498 --> 00:24:58,193
各位，大家最好是把手帕
打湿了围在脸上！

931
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:01,909
DUKE NARRATING: There was
something like 1 90 more bikes
waiting to start.

932
00:25:00,337 --> 00:25:03,202
好像还有190多辆车等着出发

933
00:25:01,993 --> 00:25:02,993
Give me a beer, man.

934
00:25:03,077 --> 00:25:04,620
They were due to go off,
1 0 at a time

935
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:06,205
-伙计，来杯啤酒
-他们一组十个人…

936
00:25:04,913 --> 00:25:06,872
every two minutes.

937
00:25:06,343 --> 00:25:08,206
每隔两分钟走一组

938
00:25:08,082 --> 00:25:09,750
BARTENDER: There you go,
buddy.

939
00:25:08,377 --> 00:25:10,240
你的

You can't park
on the sidewalk!

1099
00:29:00,847 --> 00:29:04,246
-你们不能停在人行道上！
-场面很火爆

1100
00:29:01,691 --> 00:29:02,733
Seems like a hot ticket.

1101
00:29:02,817 --> 00:29:04,025
Excuse me, sir?

1102
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,653
Drove all the way from L.A.
for this show.

1103
00:29:04,383 --> 00:29:07,043
我们专程从洛杉矶
赶来看这场表演

1104
00:29:07,219 --> 00:29:08,708
我们是黛比的朋友

1105
00:29:07,238 --> 00:29:08,822
We're friends of Debbie's.

Okay, bye.
We'll see you later.

00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,653

Bob Hope's turf,

(SINGING) Exchanging gIances

1115
00:29:19,229 --> 00:29:21,092
斯皮罗.阿格纽的地盘

1116
00:29:20,793 --> 00:29:24,504
The place fairly reeked
of high-grade Formica
and plastic palm trees.

1117
00:29:21,231 --> 00:29:25,563
这个地方到处都是高级的
丽光板和塑料棕o树

1118
00:29:25,173 --> 00:29:28,842
Clearly a high-class
refuge for big spenders.

1119
00:29:25,702 --> 00:29:29,033
很显然，是那些上流社会的人物
来挥金如土的地方

1120
00:29:30,511 --> 00:29:32,095
It's started.
Is she on stage?

1121
00:29:31,173 --> 00:29:34,265
-节目开始了，她会登台演出吗？
-会的，票都买完了

1122
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,680
MAN: She is. Sold out.

1123
00:29:33,765 --> 00:29:36,683
Sorry, sir.
Full house. I'm sorry, sir.

1124
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:37,309
对不起啦，先生，满堂红
不好意思啦，先生

1125
00:29:37,059 --> 00:29:38,935
We drove all the way
from L.A. for this show.

1126
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:40,309
我们是特意从洛杉矶
赶来看这场演出的

1127
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,188
I said there are
no seats left, sir,
at any price.

1128
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:43,813
-我已经说过了，没有座位了
-他妈的座位

1129
00:29:41,272 --> 00:29:42,439
Fuck seats!

1130
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:44,399
We're friends with Debbie.

1131
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:47,283
-我们跟黛比是朋友
我们还作过爱

1132
00:29:44,484 --> 00:29:46,067
I used to romp with her.

1133
00:29:48,946 --> 00:29:50,405
Are you prepared
to go to court?

1134
00:29:49,423 --> 00:29:52,549
-你想在法庭上见面？
-那可不一定

1135
00:29:50,531 --> 00:29:51,990
Well, that depends.

1136
00:29:52,074 --> 00:29:54,618
I wanna talk to you
for a second.

1137
00:29:52,692 --> 00:29:55,557
来，我们聊聊

1138
00:29:54,702 --> 00:29:57,788
Your attitude constitutes
a breach of faith.

1139
00:29:55,695 --> 00:29:58,719
-你的态度有些过火
-嗨

1140
00:29:58,956 --> 00:30:00,874
In Nevada, that's illegal.

1141
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:01,727
在内华达州，
这样说是违法的

1142
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,543
What's your name?

1143
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:06,626
-你叫什么？
-我的名字？托尼.皮扎卡特

1144
00:30:03,628 --> 00:30:05,629
My name? Tony Pizzacata.

TONY: What, may I ask,
is your name, sir?

1148
00:30:08,806 --> 00:30:11,171
请问您尊姓大名？

1149

GONZO: It's on my
driver's license.

我的驾驶证上有

1151
00:30:12,762 --> 00:30:16,306
I think we might be able
to squeeze you in, sir.

1152
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:16,675
我们也许可以让你进去，先生

1153
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,474
Thank you kindly.

1154
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,713
-谢谢你的关照
-你们必须站在后面

1155
00:30:17,558 --> 00:30:19,351
You'll have to
stand in the back.

1156
00:30:20,603 --> 00:30:23,897
After a lot of bad noise
he let us in for nothing

1157
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:25,016
一阵噪音过后
他就让我们进去了…

1158
00:30:24,565 --> 00:30:27,609
provided
we would stand quietly
in the back and not smoke.

1159
00:30:25,153 --> 00:30:28,143
只是让我们不要大声嚷嚷，
不要吸烟

which is interesting
because you can
actually watch yourself

有趣的是，你知道
自己的这种可怕的行为…

behaving in this terrible way
but you can't control it.

但是你却无法控制

1229
00:32:38,532 --> 00:32:41,785
You approach the turnstiles
and know that
when you get there

1230
00:32:39,304 --> 00:32:42,761
你正朝十字转门走去
而且知道到达时你要做些什么…

you have to give the man $2
or he won't let you inside.

给那个看门的两美元

-你听见自己在咕哝：
-他妈的教皇，我并没错

and turned us loose inside.

一个吸毒的人能应付这种事

(MAN CHATTERING)

Good mescaline comes on slow.

The first hour's all waiting.

1314

在第一个小时里
它们的效力都潜伏着…

1315
00:35:44,051 --> 00:35:46,219
And then about
halfway through
its second hour,

然后开始慢慢地进入
第二个阶段…

you start cursing
the creep who burned you
because nothing's happening.

你开始咒诅那个烧伤你的人

00:35:49,557 --> 00:35:51,558
And then, zang!

00:35:51,905 --> 00:35:54,235
我讨厌说这个

I hate to say this
but this place
is getting to me.

但这个地方已经
让我中邪了

I think I'm getting the fear.

我想我-
开始害怕了

1326
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:01,025
Nonsense.

1327
00:35:59,678 --> 00:36:02,543
胡说.我们来这儿是
为了找美国梦的

We came here to find
the American Dream.

1329
00:36:02,681 --> 00:36:06,012
我们已经起步了
难不成你现在还想打退堂鼓？

1330
00:36:02,736 --> 00:36:05,655
Now that we're
right in the vortex,
you wanna quit?

1331
00:36:05,739 --> 00:36:08,283
You must realize, man,
we've found the main nerve.

1332
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:09,015
你必须认识到，伙计
我们是无路可退的

1333
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:10,743
That's what
gives me the fear.

1334
00:36:09,152 --> 00:36:10,947
所以-
我才开始害怕

1335
00:36:10,828 --> 00:36:12,745
Oh, look!
What?

1336
00:36:11,088 --> 00:36:12,951
-看！
-什么？

1337
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:16,547
那儿，有两个女人在
在跟一个北极做爱

1338
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:16,457
There's two women
fucking a polar bear.

1339
00:36:16,542 --> 00:36:18,960
Don't tell me
those things.

1340
00:36:16,726 --> 00:36:19,091
不要跟我说那些事情

1341
00:36:19,044 --> 00:36:20,962
Not now, man.

1342
00:36:19,228 --> 00:36:22,059
不要在现-
现在，伙计

1343
00:36:21,964 --> 00:36:23,756
This is my last drink.

1344
00:36:22,164 --> 00:36:26,030
我不想再喝了
你可以借给我多少钱？

1345
00:36:23,883 --> 00:36:25,675
How much money
can you lend me?

1346
00:36:25,759 --> 00:36:27,343
Not much. Why?

1347
00:36:26,201 --> 00:36:27,758
不多，你想干什么？

1348
00:36:27,428 --> 00:36:29,345
I have to go.
Go?

-我想走
-走？

1350
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:31,472
Yeah. Leave the country.

1351
00:36:29,904 --> 00:36:33,100
-是的，离开这个鬼地方
-好的，现在平静下来

1352
00:36:31,557 --> 00:36:33,016
Oh, no. Calm down.

1353
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,601
You'll be straight
in a few hours.

1354
00:36:33,241 --> 00:36:36,698
过一会儿，你就会站直了
不要再坐下去了

1355
00:36:34,685 --> 00:36:36,144
Just sit down.
Sit the fuck down.

1356
00:36:36,228 --> 00:36:39,105
Don't fuck around, man.
This is serious.

1357
00:36:36,843 --> 00:36:39,708
不要乱闹，这很重要，伙计

1358
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:42,108
One more hour in this town,
I'll kill somebody.

1359
00:36:39,845 --> 00:36:42,710
让我在这里多待上一个小时
我肯定会杀人的

1360
00:36:42,848 --> 00:36:46,372
好吧，我借钱给你

1361
00:36:43,569 --> 00:36:45,904
Okay,
I'll lend you some money.

1362
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:48,713
我们会好一些吗？

1363
00:36:47,031 --> 00:36:48,531

00:36:48,887 --> 00:36:50,978
-我要马上离开这里
-好的

1365
00:36:48,908 --> 00:36:50,533
I wanna leave fast.
Okay.

我想会有很长一段路要走的

be a long walk.

Do they pay you
to screw that bear?

1373
00:37:00,931 --> 00:37:03,796
他们雇用你跟-
那头熊干，是不是？

1374
00:37:03,505 --> 00:37:06,132
What?

1375
00:37:03,934 --> 00:37:06,662
什么？什么？

1376
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,468
What the fuck
did he say to me?
He's drunk.

1377
00:37:06,803 --> 00:37:08,962
-他刚刚对我说了些什么？
-他喝多了

1378
00:37:08,552 --> 00:37:10,637
You'd better take care
of your friend.

你最好照顾好你的朋友

随便什么东西吧，我可以付-

Here, take this.
That should be enough.

1383
00:37:14,043 --> 00:37:16,009
拿着
这也许够了

1384
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:18,311
All right, come on.
Let's go downstairs
and gamble.

1385
00:37:16,144 --> 00:37:19,441
快下来
我们下楼去赌一把

fucking give up.

你们这些家伙是不会放弃的

1388
00:37:23,817 --> 00:37:25,568
Where'd he go?

1389
00:37:24,452 --> 00:37:26,509
他去哪了？

1390
00:37:25,861 --> 00:37:27,612
Where did he go?

1391
00:37:26,686 --> 00:37:28,151
他会在哪呢？

1392
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:33,989

-停下来？

1393
00:37:31,325 --> 00:37:33,493
When is this
thing gonna stop?
Stop?

1394
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:36,955
Stop it!
It won't stop.
It's never gonna stop, man.

1395
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:37,288
-让它停下来！
-它不会停下来的
永远都不会，伙计

1396
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:38,831
Don't move. You'll fall down.

1397

Where did he go? Oh.

00:37:42,433 --> 00:37:45,298
他会去哪了-

1402
00:37:44,546 --> 00:37:46,673
Come on. Let go.

1403
00:37:45,437 --> 00:37:47,300
快点，我们走吧

1404
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,217
Quick, like a bunny.
Hop! Hop!

1405
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:49,769
快点起来，不要像个傻瓜似的
快点，跳下去

1406
00:37:49,802 --> 00:37:51,552
Come on. Hop!
I can't!

1407
00:37:49,907 --> 00:37:51,770
-快点，跳下去！
-妈的！

1408
00:37:51,637 --> 00:37:55,098
Oh, you sniveling,
chicken shit bastard !
Stop it!

1409
00:37:51,909 --> 00:37:55,344
你在哭
你这个胆小鬼

1410
00:37:58,477 --> 00:38:00,061
All right.

1411
00:37:58,514 --> 00:38:00,003
好的

1412
00:38:05,621 --> 00:38:08,486
快点-
妈的

1413
00:38:06,777 --> 00:38:07,986
Fuck!

1414
00:38:08,445 --> 00:38:10,280
Come on.
You fell, you fell. Let's go.

1415
00:38:08,624 --> 00:38:10,419
起来，你摔倒了，你摔倒了
我们走吧

1416
00:38:10,364 --> 00:38:12,824
Son of a bitch.
You pushed me.

1417
00:38:10,558 --> 00:38:13,423
杂种，你推我了

1418
00:38:12,908 --> 00:38:14,575
Go away!
Come on.

1419
00:38:13,561 --> 00:38:15,151
-走开！
-走吧

1420
00:38:14,868 --> 00:38:17,287
All right. You stay here
and go to jail. I'm leaving.

1421
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:18,160
好吧，你就待在这等着
进监狱吧，我要走了

1422
00:38:18,163 --> 00:38:19,747
Come on, you fiend !

1423
00:38:18,298 --> 00:38:19,992
你这个魔王！

1424
00:38:19,832 --> 00:38:21,708
Step right over. . .
Nothing. I want nothing.

1425
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:21,996
-走开-
-什么都不要，我什么都不要

1426
00:38:21,792 --> 00:38:23,459
Did you see that?

1427
00:38:22,135 --> 00:38:23,998
你看到了吗？

1428
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,461
Come on.

1429
00:38:25,339 --> 00:38:28,535
有个杂种在后面踢了我一脚

1430
00:38:25,546 --> 00:38:27,922
Some son of a bitch
just kicked me in the back.

1431
00:38:28,007 --> 00:38:29,048
Probably the bartender.

1432
00:38:28,708 --> 00:38:32,074
也许是酒吧间男招待吧
因为你对女服务生说了坏话

1433
00:38:29,133 --> 00:38:31,175
Wanted to stomp you
for what you said
to the waitress.

1434
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:34,137
Holy moley! Holy moley!
Cows are gonna kill me!

1435
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:35,075
-游戏，游戏
-鸡可以杀了我

1436
00:38:34,221 --> 00:38:36,389
Bisexuals are gonna kill me.

1437
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,545
两性人也可以杀了我

1438
00:38:36,807 --> 00:38:38,433
Let's get out of here.
Where's the elevator?

1439
00:38:37,683 --> 00:38:40,048
我们出去
电梯在哪？

1440
00:38:38,517 --> 00:38:40,310
No, fuck! Don't go
near the elevator, man !

1441
00:38:40,185 --> 00:38:43,050
不要进电梯！
那是他们设下的陷阱

1442
00:38:40,394 --> 00:38:42,145
That's just what
they want us to do.

1443
00:38:42,229 --> 00:38:46,065
Trap us in a steel box,
take us down to the basement.
Come here.

1444
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:47,451
把我们困在那个铁笼子里面
把我们带到地下室去

1445

(GUN FIRING)

Don't run, man.

1447
00:38:49,893 --> 00:38:53,259
不要跑，伙计.
他们会找借口向我们开枪的

1448
00:38:50,696 --> 00:38:52,780
They'd like any excuse
to shoot us.

1449
00:38:55,534 --> 00:38:57,452
You drive. You drive.

1450
00:38:56,865 --> 00:38:58,728
你开车

1451
00:38:58,537 --> 00:39:01,748
I think there's
something wrong with me.

1452
00:38:58,866 --> 00:39:01,992
我好像有点问题

1453
00:39:06,306 --> 00:39:08,465
开错门了

1454
00:39:07,463 --> 00:39:09,339
Wrong door. Wrong door.

1455
00:39:08,575 --> 00:39:10,370
走错门了

This is not a good town
for psychedelic drugs.

这个城市并不适合吸毒

1458
00:39:13,427 --> 00:39:15,928
Extremely menacing vibrations
were all around us.

1459

四周都布满了陷阱

1460
00:39:16,889 --> 00:39:18,431
We finally made it
to the room,

1461
00:39:17,084 --> 00:39:20,779
我们总算找对了门
但是却打不开锁

1462
00:39:19,016 --> 00:39:21,017
but the key
wouldn't open the door.

1463
00:39:22,227 --> 00:39:24,604
Those bastards have changed
the lock on us, man.

1464

-那些杂种换了我们的锁
-已经换了？

1465
00:39:25,439 --> 00:39:26,731
Already?

1466
00:39:27,358 --> 00:39:29,984
They probably
searched the room, man.

1467
00:39:27,693 --> 00:39:31,059
他们极有可能
搜了我们的屋子

1468
00:39:30,611 --> 00:39:32,862
Jesus Christ,
we're finished.

天，我们完了

1470
00:39:35,657 --> 00:39:37,825
Move out of the way.
Look out! Look out!

That's better. That's better.

1480
00:39:50,112 --> 00:39:52,374
这一串是从哪来的？

1481
00:39:50,506 --> 00:39:52,757
Where did this one come from?

1482
00:39:54,649 --> 00:39:56,512
那是拉喀达的

1483
00:39:54,802 --> 00:39:56,219
That's Lacerda's.

1484
00:39:56,303 --> 00:39:58,971
Yeah. Yeah.
I thought we might need it.

1485
00:39:56,651 --> 00:39:58,514
我想，这对我们会有些用的

1486
00:39:59,431 --> 00:40:02,141
What for?

1487
00:39:59,854 --> 00:40:02,219
-干什么用？
-干什么用？

1488
00:40:02,226 --> 00:40:05,853
So we can go up there
and blast him out of bed

1489
00:40:02,355 --> 00:40:07,381
这样的话，我们就可以
去他的地方，用一根灭火水龙带
把他炸到天上去

1490
00:40:05,938 --> 00:40:07,355
with a fire hose, man.

1491
00:40:08,315 --> 00:40:10,691
I think we should leave
that poor bastard alone.

1492
00:40:08,895 --> 00:40:11,760
我想我们最好不要去惹他

1493
00:40:10,776 --> 00:40:12,527
He told me he was
gonna turn in early, so. . .

1494
00:40:11,897 --> 00:40:15,093
-他跟我说过，他一般
睡得很早，所以--我知道

1495
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:14,112
I knew it.

1496
00:40:14,655 --> 00:40:16,989
He got a hold
of my woman, man !

1497
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,666
他抢走了我的女人，伙计

1498
00:40:17,836 --> 00:40:21,202
你是说那个娇小金发女
跟那个摄影师搞到一块了？

1499

You mean that blonde groupie
with the film crew?

1500

妈的，想他鸡奸她吗？

1501
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:23,496
Shit.
Think he sodomized her?

1502

That's right.
Laugh about it.

1503
00:40:24,008 --> 00:40:25,871
肯定会，他一定很得意

1504
00:40:25,499 --> 00:40:26,833
He's gluing her eyes
shut right now, man.

made a fool of himself.

-我觉得你长得很像她

I think you look
just like him.

You think so?

1538
00:41:23,932 --> 00:41:25,892
You must be a rider.
Hmm?

1539
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,923
你一定是个骑手

1540
00:41:28,228 --> 00:41:30,271
She's speaking to you.

1541
00:41:28,565 --> 00:41:30,759
她在跟你说话

00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:36,633
你是第几个种类的？

种类？

Class?

1546
00:41:38,238 --> 00:41:40,239
What the fuck do you mean?

1716
00:46:29,613 --> 00:46:31,030
Oh, God.

1717
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,155
上帝

1718
00:46:32,295 --> 00:46:34,158
你把这些这幻药都吃了吗？

1719
00:46:32,532 --> 00:46:34,116
Did you eat all this acid?

1720

That's right. Music!

不错，音乐！

You better pray to God
there's some Thorazine
in that bag.

1723

你最好向上帝祈祷
那些袋子里有氯丙秦

Otherwise, you're in
bad fucking trouble.

-否则，你要有大麻烦了
-音乐，伙计，放录音带

1726

Music, man,
put that tape on !

1727
00:46:42,626 --> 00:46:45,127
What tape?
Jefferson Airplane.

-放什么录音带？
-杰弗逊飞机乐队.“”白兔''

1729
00:46:45,212 --> 00:46:46,754
I need a rising sound.

-声音大些
-你真是没药可救了

You're doomed.

Just do me one last favor,
will you?

1742
00:46:59,318 --> 00:47:01,945
可以帮我最后一个忙吗？

1743
00:47:01,645 --> 00:47:03,562
Give me two hours.
That's all I ask, man.

1744
00:47:02,088 --> 00:47:03,951
我只要你给我两个小时

让我在天亮前睡一会

1746

Two hours to sleep
before tomorrow.

1747
00:47:07,192 --> 00:47:08,943
This is fixed.

It's gonna be

这会是个不寻常的一天

I'll give you all

throw this thing into the tub

00:50:44,415 --> 00:50:46,745
-为什么不会？
-你这个杂种

1873
00:50:44,951 --> 00:50:46,368
You fucking bastard !

1874
00:50:46,453 --> 00:50:49,496
Hell, just a minute ago
you were asking me
to kill you.

1875
00:50:46,883 --> 00:50:51,408
几分钟前，你让我杀了你
现在你却想杀我

1876
00:50:49,706 --> 00:50:51,123
Now you wanna kill me.

1877
00:50:51,521 --> 00:50:54,579
不然你让我怎么做
去把警察叫来吗！

1878
00:50:51,541 --> 00:50:54,293
What l should do, goddamn it,
is call the fucking police!

1879
00:50:54,377 --> 00:50:56,795
Boy, are you upset.

1880
00:50:54,723 --> 00:50:57,315
你是不是晕头了

1881
00:50:58,214 --> 00:51:01,133
There'd be no point, man,
calling the cops.

1882
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,152
不可以叫警察，没门

1883
00:51:01,296 --> 00:51:03,159
我别无选择

1884
00:51:01,593 --> 00:51:03,510
There's no choice.

1885
00:51:03,297 --> 00:51:07,163
谁敢跟你这个满脑子都
装着迷幻剂又四处游荡的人
睡在一起.

1886
00:51:03,636 --> 00:51:06,805
l wouldn't dare go to sleep
with you wandering around
with a head full of acid

1887
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:09,266
wanting to slice me up
with that goddamn knife.

1888
00:51:07,301 --> 00:51:10,097
更何况，
你还要用刀把我割成肉片

1889
00:51:10,236 --> 00:51:13,101
谁说要把你割成肉片了？

1890
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:12,853
Who said anything
about slicing you up, man?

1891
00:51:15,315 --> 00:51:18,442
I just wanted to cut
a little "Z" in your forehead.

1892
00:51:15,574 --> 00:51:18,632
我只是想在你的额头上
打个Z''形的印记

1893
00:51:18,526 --> 00:51:19,985
(WHEEZING LAUGHTER)

1894
00:51:20,445 --> 00:51:21,862
Get back in the tub.

1895
00:51:20,879 --> 00:51:25,109
回到浴盆去
吃些胺红让自己平静下来

1896
00:51:22,363 --> 00:51:24,656
Eat some reds
and try to calm down.

1897
00:51:25,033 --> 00:51:27,451
Smoke some grass.
Shoot some fucking smack.

1898
00:51:25,217 --> 00:51:28,082
吸一些大麻，白粉

1899
00:51:27,702 --> 00:51:30,662
Shit, man, do whatever
you gotta do, but please,

1900
00:51:28,219 --> 00:51:31,585
去吧，你愿意干什么
就去干什么吧…

1901
00:51:31,331 --> 00:51:34,458
l need some fucking rest, man.
Please. Please.

1902
00:51:31,722 --> 00:51:35,157
我需要休息
伙计，拜?你，拜?了

1903
00:51:34,959 --> 00:51:36,668
Get up, you pig fucker!

1904
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:37,815
出去，你这头猪！

1905
00:51:37,961 --> 00:51:40,985
起来！起来！

1906
00:51:37,962 --> 00:51:40,005
Up! Up!

1907
00:51:40,673 --> 00:51:42,549
Well, I, uh. . .

1908
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:43,995
我-

1909
00:51:43,885 --> 00:51:45,010
Yeah.

1910
00:51:44,133 --> 00:51:45,996
是的

1911
00:51:46,805 --> 00:51:48,889
You need to get to work.

1912
00:51:47,235 --> 00:51:49,794
你还有工作要做

1913
00:51:49,474 --> 00:51:51,391
Goddamn, what a bummer.

1914
00:51:49,971 --> 00:51:52,028
天，真是个无赖

1915
00:51:52,018 --> 00:51:53,936
You scurvy shyster bastard.

1916
00:51:52,207 --> 00:51:54,070
你这个奸诈之徒

1917
00:51:54,208 --> 00:51:56,868
我是新闻博士，伙计

1918
00:51:54,312 --> 00:51:56,480
l'm a Doctor of Journalism,
man.

1919
00:51:56,564 --> 00:51:57,856
Go on.

1920
00:51:56,977 --> 00:51:58,840
快走

1921
00:51:58,817 --> 00:52:00,109
Don't let me keep you up.

1922
00:51:58,979 --> 00:52:01,002
我不会输给你的

1923
00:52:00,193 --> 00:52:02,194
Now...
Don't let me keep you up.

1924
00:52:01,148 --> 00:52:04,309
我不会输给你的

1925
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:06,073
Get in there
and clean your shorts!

1926
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:07,315
你的短裤是干净的吗

1927
00:52:06,157 --> 00:52:09,076
Clean your shorts, goddamn it,
like a big boy. Go on!

1928
00:52:07,452 --> 00:52:10,248
去洗干净，妈的
要像个乖宝宝！快去！

1929
00:52:10,161 --> 00:52:11,453
Pig!

1930
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:12,253
猪！

1931
00:52:15,193 --> 00:52:18,058
迷幻药已经在
他身体里发生了作用

1932
00:52:15,416 --> 00:52:17,209
DUKE NARRATING: The acid
had shifted gears on him.

1933
00:52:17,877 --> 00:52:19,128
The next phase
would probably be

1934
00:52:18,195 --> 00:52:22,061
接下来就该是
一些可怕的恶梦了

1935
00:52:19,212 --> 00:52:21,463
one of those
hellishly intense
introspective nightmares.

1936
00:52:21,548 --> 00:52:23,006
Must get some peace.

1937
00:52:22,199 --> 00:52:24,062
该有些宁静

1938
00:52:23,174 --> 00:52:25,926
DUKE NARRATING:
Four hours or so
of catatonic despair.

1939
00:52:24,234 --> 00:52:27,360
-大约会有四个小时左右的
紧张性精神失落症

1940
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:28,554
Damn drugs.

1941
00:52:27,538 --> 00:52:30,528
-该死的毒品

1942
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:31,849
Mmm?

1943
00:52:36,563 --> 00:52:38,981
lgnore the nightmare
in the bathroom.

1944
00:52:36,712 --> 00:52:40,373
我们就先不要谈
那浴室里的恶梦

1945
00:52:40,233 --> 00:52:42,943
Just another ugly refugee
from the love generation.

1946
00:52:40,515 --> 00:52:43,711
那只是人爱情
失意的另一个避难所

1947
00:52:44,737 --> 00:52:47,072
My attorney had
never been able
to accept the notion

1948
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,985
我的律师从没就不能
接受这个观点…

1949
00:52:47,157 --> 00:52:49,575
often espoused by
former drug abusers

1950
00:52:48,122 --> 00:52:50,487
他总是受到以前
毒品观点的影响…

1951
00:52:49,826 --> 00:52:52,119
that you can get a lot higher
without drugs than with them.

1952
00:52:50,624 --> 00:52:53,820
没有毒品的话
人可以上升到一个更高的境界

1953
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:55,497
And neither have l,
for that matter.

1954
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,823
而我也是

1955
00:52:55,665 --> 00:52:58,375
(SINGING)
When the truth is found

1956
00:52:58,459 --> 00:53:02,337
To be lies

1957
00:53:02,922 --> 00:53:05,549
And all the joy

1958
00:53:05,633 --> 00:53:09,469
Within you dies

1959
00:53:09,554 --> 00:53:12,973
Don't you want
somebody to love

1960
00:53:13,057 --> 00:53:16,685
Don't you need
somebody to love

1961
00:53:16,769 --> 00:53:20,355
Wouldn't you love
somebody to love

1962
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:25,110
You better find
somebody to love

1963
00:53:25,486 --> 00:53:27,112
Love

1964
00:53:29,532 --> 00:53:33,452
DUKE NARRATING: 1965.
The great San Francisco
acid wave.

1965
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:34,123
1965.旧金山的毒品风波

1966
00:53:33,745 --> 00:53:36,079
(SINGING)
When the garden flowers

1967
00:53:36,372 --> 00:53:38,916
l recall one night
in a place called the Matrix.

1968
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:41,368
我记起了一个叫
马特利克斯的地方，我在这-

1969
00:53:39,459 --> 00:53:40,459
There l was.

1970
00:53:41,169 --> 00:53:43,587
Mother of God. There l am.

1971
00:53:41,505 --> 00:53:44,872
圣母玛利亚！我在这

1972
00:53:44,839 --> 00:53:46,006
Holy fuck.

1973
00:53:45,009 --> 00:53:46,873
妈的

1974
00:53:46,883 --> 00:53:50,177
Clearly l was a victim
of the drug explosion,

1975
00:53:47,011 --> 00:53:51,242
很显然地，
我是毒品大爆炸的牺牲品…

1976
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:54,306
a natural street freak just
eating whatever came by.

1977
00:53:51,382 --> 00:53:55,045
一条自然的“街道怪诞思想”
会吃掉所有路过的人

1978
00:53:54,515 --> 00:54:00,020
Does anybody want some LSD?

1979
00:53:55,187 --> 00:54:00,090
有人想要迷幻药吗？

1980
00:54:00,225 --> 00:54:03,717
我这儿有…

1981
00:54:00,396 --> 00:54:05,317
I got all the makings
right here!

1982
00:54:03,771 --> 00:54:06,364
现成的！

1983
00:54:06,152 --> 00:54:11,156
(ECHOING)
All I need is a place
to cook.

1984
00:54:06,542 --> 00:54:12,309
我只需要
找个地方加工一下

1985
00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:18,121
l decided to eat only
half of the acid at first.

1986
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:18,910
我决定首先只
吃掉一半迷幻剂…

1987
00:54:18,206 --> 00:54:21,166
But l spilled the rest
on the sleeve of
my red woolen shirt.

1988
00:54:19,055 --> 00:54:22,786
然后把剩下的撒在
毛线衣的袖子上

1989
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:31,155
出什么问题了？

1990
00:54:27,507 --> 00:54:30,717
(ECHOING)
What's the trouble?

1991
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:34,269
我袖子上的…

1992
00:54:31,928 --> 00:54:36,890
(ECHOING) Well, all this
white stuff on my sleeve

1993
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:37,430
这些白色物品…

1994
00:54:38,876 --> 00:54:42,868
是迷幻药

1995
00:54:39,269 --> 00:54:42,312
is LSD.

1996
00:54:57,964 --> 00:55:00,693
运气很糟…

1997
00:54:58,288 --> 00:55:01,707
DUKE: With a bit of luck,
his life was ruined forever.

1998
00:55:00,832 --> 00:55:02,696
从此他的生命就被毁了…

1999
00:55:02,834 --> 00:55:07,567
他常想在他酒吧那扇窄门后…

2000
00:55:03,042 --> 00:55:07,045
Always thinking that just
behind some narrow door
in all his favorite bars,

2001
00:55:07,422 --> 00:55:12,634
men in red woolen shirts
are getting incredible kicks
from things he'll never know.

2002
00:55:07,707 --> 00:55:09,902
穿着红色毛衣的人…

2003
00:55:10,076 --> 00:55:13,943
从他根本就不知道的东西
身上得到一种难以置信的乐趣

2004
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:22,311
Strange memories
on this nervous night
in Las Vegas.

2005
00:55:19,687 --> 00:55:23,315
在拉斯维加斯度过的
这个紧张之夜，让我留下了
一种奇怪的记忆

2006
00:55:23,313 --> 00:55:26,398
Has it been five years? Six?

2007
00:55:23,457 --> 00:55:28,019
有五年？还是六年？

2008
00:55:27,984 --> 00:55:33,196
lt seems like a lifetime,
the kind of peak
that never comes again.

2009
00:55:28,163 --> 00:55:33,225
似乎有一辈子那么长
这种紧张再也没出现在我身上

2010
00:55:33,281 --> 00:55:35,657
(SINGING) Love is but a song
we're singing

2011
00:55:36,159 --> 00:55:38,493
San Francisco
in the middle '60s

2012
00:55:36,471 --> 00:55:38,904
六十年代中期，旧金山…

2013
00:55:38,703 --> 00:55:41,371
was a very special time
and place to be a part of,

2014
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:42,907
那是个特殊的年代
特殊的地方…

2015
00:55:42,832 --> 00:55:43,957
but no explanation.

2016
00:55:43,044 --> 00:55:45,637
-但是没有任何一种解释…

2017
00:55:44,042 --> 00:55:45,292
(SINGING) We can make
the mountains ring

2018

No mix of words
or music or memories

2019
00:55:45,815 --> 00:55:47,679
语言，音乐或者是记忆…

2020
00:55:47,462 --> 00:55:50,547
can touch
that sense of knowing
that you were there and alive

2021
00:55:47,783 --> 00:55:51,183
可以说得出你在
那里活过的那种感觉…

2022
00:55:51,007 --> 00:55:54,718
in that corner of time
in the world,
whatever it meant.

2023
00:55:51,353 --> 00:55:55,255
它只是这个世界上
一个时间的角落而矣

2027
00:56:04,854 --> 00:56:07,898
There was madness
in any direction,
at any hour.

你可以在
任何一个地方游行示威

2031
00:56:09,442 --> 00:56:10,901
You could strike sparks
anywhere.

(SINGING)
Try to love one another

2033
00:56:12,612 --> 00:56:14,321
There was a fantastic
universal sense

2034
00:56:13,711 --> 00:56:15,736
那个时候流行着一种感觉…

2035
00:56:14,405 --> 00:56:16,656
that whatever we were doing
was right,

2036
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,313
我们做的任何事情
都是对的
我们是赢家

2037
00:56:16,741 --> 00:56:18,283
that we were winning.

2038
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:21,244
And that, l think,
was the handle.

2039
00:56:19,551 --> 00:56:21,780
我想，也许那也算是
一种人生的赌注吧

2040
00:56:21,329 --> 00:56:23,288
(SINGING) Some may come
and some may go

2041
00:56:23,373 --> 00:56:26,625
That sense of inevitable
victory over the forces
of old and evil.

2042
00:56:23,788 --> 00:56:27,280
那种不可避免的成功感
超越了一切邪恶的力量

2043
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:30,588
跟军事是完全挂不上钩的-
我们根本就不需要那个

2044
00:56:27,502 --> 00:56:30,754
Not in any mean
or military sense,
we didn't need that.

2045
00:56:32,423 --> 00:56:34,508
Our energy would
simply prevail.

2046
00:56:32,664 --> 00:56:35,291
我们的敌人随时
都可能会强大起来

2047
00:56:35,435 --> 00:56:38,597
是的，我们那时动力十足

2048
00:56:35,676 --> 00:56:37,427
We had all the momentum.

2049
00:56:38,179 --> 00:56:41,681
We were riding the crest
of a high and beautiful wave.

2050
00:56:38,737 --> 00:56:42,172
我们正赶上了那次浪潮的高峰

2051
00:56:43,743 --> 00:56:48,509
所以现在，五年之后…

2052
00:56:43,935 --> 00:56:47,354
So now,
less than 5 years later,

2053
00:56:48,481 --> 00:56:51,483
you can go up a steep hill
in Las Vegas and look west

2054
00:56:48,649 --> 00:56:52,175
当你爬上拉斯维加斯
陡斜的小山坡向西望时…

2055
00:56:51,984 --> 00:56:54,111
and with the right kind
of eyes,

2056
00:56:52,353 --> 00:56:54,877
只要你用对角度…

2057
00:56:54,862 --> 00:56:57,030
you can almost see
the high-water mark,

2058
00:56:55,022 --> 00:56:57,990
就能望见高潮时期的那个标志…

2059
00:56:57,990 --> 00:57:02,327
that place where
the wave finally broke
and rolled back.

2060
00:56:58,158 --> 00:57:01,024
那个潮流涌来…

2061
00:57:01,161 --> 00:57:03,025
又激退的地方

What do you want?

I've got a gun.
It's not mine, really.
Get out.

DUKE NARRATING:
The decision to flee
came suddenly.

2093
00:57:55,386 --> 00:57:59,788
突然有了种想逃的感觉，
也许不是

2094
00:57:58,384 --> 00:57:59,426
Or maybe not.

2095
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:01,636
That cigarette you're smoking
about scared me half to death

2096
00:57:59,925 --> 00:58:03,883
也许是我一直
就在计划着要逃

2097
00:58:01,721 --> 00:58:05,807
Maybe l'd planned it
all along, subconsciously
waiting for the right moment.

2098
00:58:04,029 --> 00:58:06,326
只是在浅意识里一直
就在等这么一次机会

2099
00:58:06,058 --> 00:58:07,100
Mama told me not to come

2100
00:58:06,465 --> 00:58:09,262
我想，那张清单就是原因之一…

2101
00:58:07,185 --> 00:58:08,977
The bill was a factor,
l think,

2102
00:58:09,061 --> 00:58:10,312
because l had no money
to pay for it.

2103
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:12,131
因为我没钱支付

2104
00:58:10,396 --> 00:58:11,813
Mama told me not to come

2105
00:58:11,898 --> 00:58:13,315
Our room service tabs
had been running

2106
00:58:12,271 --> 00:58:16,138
我们的客房服务是
每小时29到36元…

2107
00:58:13,399 --> 00:58:16,401
somewhere between
29 and 36 dollars per hour

2108
00:58:16,276 --> 00:58:19,142
是48小时服务

2109
00:58:16,486 --> 00:58:19,654
for 48 consecutive hours.
lncredible.

2110
00:58:19,279 --> 00:58:21,143
真是难以置信

2111
00:58:19,739 --> 00:58:20,780
That ain't the way
to have fun, son

2112
00:58:20,865 --> 00:58:22,824
How could it happen?

2113
00:58:21,281 --> 00:58:23,145
这怎么可能呢？

2114
00:58:22,909 --> 00:58:25,160
But by the time
l asked this question,

2115
00:58:23,283 --> 00:58:27,582
但是现在已经没人
能回答这个问题了

2116
00:58:25,244 --> 00:58:27,496
there was no one around
to answer it.

2117
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:30,373
That rotten attorney of mine,
Dr. Gonzo, was gone.

2118
00:58:27,722 --> 00:58:30,781
我的那个死律师贡兹已经走了

2119
00:58:30,917 --> 00:58:32,584
He must have sensed trouble.

2120
00:58:30,958 --> 00:58:32,822
也许他早就知道会有麻烦了

2121
00:58:33,628 --> 00:58:35,462
Hmm? Oh. A "Z"?

2122
00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:36,592
一个“Z”？

2123
00:58:36,732 --> 00:58:38,699
惊慌

2124
00:58:37,215 --> 00:58:38,340
Panic.

2125
00:58:38,866 --> 00:58:43,632
它悄悄爬上我的脊梁骨
就像是吸过迷幻药后的颤抖

2126
00:58:39,717 --> 00:58:43,345
lt crept up my spine
like first-rising vibes
of an acid frenzy.

2127
00:58:43,772 --> 00:58:47,639
我开始接受这可怕的现实

2128
00:58:44,305 --> 00:58:46,890
All these horrible realities
began to dawn on me.

DUKE NARRATING: Here I was,
alone in Las Vegas,

2133
00:58:52,582 --> 00:58:55,573
一个人孤苦伶仃的待在
拉斯维加斯，完全被毒品扭曲

2134
00:58:54,232 --> 00:58:55,857
completely twisted on drugs.

2135
00:58:55,718 --> 00:58:58,948
没有现金
也没有替报社找到新闻报道…

2136
00:58:55,942 --> 00:58:58,985
No cash,
no story for the magazine,

2137
00:58:59,088 --> 00:59:04,491
而最最重要的是
我没钱支付饭店的清单

2138
00:58:59,153 --> 00:59:03,823
and on top of everything else
l had a gigantic goddamn
hotel bill to deal with.

2139
00:59:06,577 --> 00:59:10,038
l didn't even know
who'd won the race.
Maybe nobody.

我甚至不知道
谁赢了那场比赛

2141

也许没人赢

Stay calm. Stay calm.

2145
00:59:15,539 --> 00:59:18,769
冷静，冷静

2146
00:59:18,673 --> 00:59:20,757
l'm a relatively
respectable citizen.

2147
00:59:18,909 --> 00:59:21,172
我是个有名望的公民

2148
00:59:21,133 --> 00:59:24,469
Multiple felon, perhaps,
but certainly not dangerous.

2149
00:59:21,312 --> 00:59:24,280
很坏，也许，
但是我并不是危险人物

2150
00:59:24,416 --> 00:59:26,782
计程车

Luckily, l had taken
the soap and grapefruit

2153
00:59:26,918 --> 00:59:31,377
很幸运，我很早就把肥皂
以及葡萄和其它一些行李
放进车里了

2154
00:59:28,808 --> 00:59:31,560
and other luggage
out to the car
a few hours earlier.

2155
00:59:31,524 --> 00:59:32,990
现在-

2156
00:59:31,644 --> 00:59:34,896
Now, it was only a matter
of slipping the noose.

是时候逃了

2158
00:59:34,981 --> 00:59:36,982
Hey! Here, take this.
All right.

2159
00:59:35,126 --> 00:59:38,857
嘿，拿着

2160
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:43,022
-杜克先生，杜克先生！
-该死

Oh, shit.

-我们一直在找你
-比赛开始了，他们都等着我呢

We've been looking for you.

2165
00:59:45,575 --> 00:59:47,867
The game was up.
They had me.

2166
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:50,770
很多经典的书
都是在监狱写成的

2167
00:59:48,578 --> 00:59:50,996
Many fine books have been
written in prison, huh?

2168
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:53,037
-先生？
-什么？

2169
00:59:51,998 --> 00:59:53,498
Sir?
What?

2170
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:55,205
这是你的电报

2171
00:59:54,834 --> 00:59:56,209
This telegram came for you.

2172
00:59:55,348 --> 00:59:58,282
事实上，并不是给你的
是给一个叫汤普森的人

2173
00:59:56,294 --> 00:59:59,254
Actually, it's not for you.
It's for somebody named
Thompson.

2174
00:59:58,419 --> 01:00:01,717
但它上面也写了
由杜克先生转交''你-你-

2175
00:59:59,338 --> 01:00:00,797
But it says,
"Care of Raoul Duke."

2176
01:00:00,881 --> 01:00:03,300
Do you. . . Do you. . .
Does that mean anything?

-是的，是的，是很重要，谢谢你了

Yes, yes, it means a lot.
Thanks.

2179

我们查了一下登记薄

2180
01:00:06,012 --> 01:00:08,263
Yeah, I checked the register
for this man Thompson.

2181
01:00:08,347 --> 01:00:10,473
We don't show him,
but I figured he might
be part of your team.

但没他的记录，所以我们猜想，
他应该跟你是一道的

He is. Don't worry.
I'll get it to him.

-是的，不错，我会
转交给他的-好的

Dr. Gonzo's signature
on the telegram
from Los Angeles

01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:20,235
贡兹博士的签名是从洛杉矶来的
但据我们所知，他人在这

2189
01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:20,191
when we knew he was
right here in the hotel.

2190
01:00:20,276 --> 01:00:22,527
Right.
You did the right thing.

When will the doctor
be awake?

2201

Awake? What do you mean?

2203
01:00:36,959 --> 01:00:41,588
Well, my manager, Mr. Heem,
would like to meet him.

2204
01:00:39,096 --> 01:00:42,690
我们的经理黑姆先生
想见见他

2205
01:00:42,833 --> 01:00:45,266
也不是什么大不了的事-

2206
01:00:42,882 --> 01:00:47,218
It's nothing unusual,
Mr. Heem likes to meet
all of our large accounts,

you know?

比较大的客房，你明白吗？

是的，但如果我是你…

Of course, but if I were you,

2215
01:00:56,114 --> 01:00:58,445
我会等他吃完早餐后
再去找他…

2216
01:00:56,354 --> 01:00:58,271
I would leave the
doctor alone until after
he's eaten his breakfast

2217
01:00:58,356 --> 01:01:00,231
because he's
a very crude man.

It's actually from Thompson,
not to him.

Now, I've got to go.
I've gotta get to the race.

你为何用信号灯告诉他

01:04:24,337 --> 01:04:26,566
前面就有个休息的地方

2329
01:04:26,355 --> 01:04:29,607
I'd like you to
go up there, pull over
and get a few hours' sleep.

2330
01:04:26,706 --> 01:04:29,868
我希望你开车到那里后
停车去休息一会

2331
01:04:29,733 --> 01:04:31,025
That's not gonna help me.

2332
01:04:30,010 --> 01:04:31,977
那对我没什么大的帮助

2333
01:04:31,777 --> 01:04:34,946
I've been awake for too long,
three or four nights, maybe.
Can't even remember.

2334
01:04:32,112 --> 01:04:35,239
我知道也记不清有几个
晚上没睡了，也许三四个吧

2335
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:37,782
I go to sleep now,
I'm dead for 20 hours.

2336
01:04:35,382 --> 01:04:38,044
是的，我现在得睡会了
我已经精疲力竭了

2337
01:04:39,368 --> 01:04:42,287
What are you carrying
two cases of soap for, son?

2338
01:04:39,653 --> 01:04:42,486
你为什么要带上两盒肥皂？

2339
01:04:42,590 --> 01:04:44,956
我有洁癖，
喜欢让自己干干净净的

2340
01:04:42,705 --> 01:04:44,622
I wanna stay clean.

2341
01:04:45,092 --> 01:04:46,956
不

2342
01:04:45,833 --> 01:04:46,958
No.

2343
01:04:48,362 --> 01:04:50,056
是这样的

2344
01:04:48,544 --> 01:04:49,878
Here's how it is.

2345
01:04:50,129 --> 01:04:52,881
What I put in my book,
as of noon,

2346
01:04:50,198 --> 01:04:53,031
我已作下登记…

2347
01:04:52,965 --> 01:04:56,217
is that I apprehended you
for driving too fast.

2348
01:04:53,168 --> 01:04:56,365
你开车太快

2349
01:04:56,505 --> 01:04:59,702
我建议你到下一个休息区

2350
01:04:56,969 --> 01:05:00,221
(HUMMING)
I advised you to proceed
to the next rest area. . . Stop!

2351
01:04:59,841 --> 01:05:01,705
站住

2352
01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:10,315
I advised you to proceed
to the next rest area, your
stated destination, right?

2353
01:05:04,914 --> 01:05:07,780
我建议你到下一个休息区-

2354
01:05:07,917 --> 01:05:10,885
你的下一个目的地？

2355
01:05:12,443 --> 01:05:14,110
And take a long nap.

2356
01:05:12,556 --> 01:05:15,047
好好休息一下

2357
01:05:15,988 --> 01:05:17,655
Do I make myself clear?

2358
01:05:16,325 --> 01:05:18,691
我说的够清楚了吧

2359
01:05:18,532 --> 01:05:21,326
Well, how far is Baker?

2360
01:05:18,829 --> 01:05:21,763
离贝克还有多远？

2361
01:05:21,744 --> 01:05:25,288
I was sort of hoping to,
I don't know,
stop there for lunch.

2362
01:05:21,899 --> 01:05:25,231
我想在那儿停下吃午餐

2363
01:05:26,457 --> 01:05:27,999
It's not my jurisdiction.

2364
01:05:26,771 --> 01:05:28,635
这个不关我的事

2365
01:05:28,459 --> 01:05:31,419
City limits end 2.2 miles
beyond the rest area.

2366
01:05:28,773 --> 01:05:32,230
在休息区开车不得
超过2.2英里

2367
01:05:32,377 --> 01:05:34,276
做得到吗？

2368
01:05:32,379 --> 01:05:33,922
Can you make it that far?

2369
01:05:34,298 --> 01:05:35,506
I'll try.

2370
01:05:34,412 --> 01:05:36,504
我会尽力的

2371
01:05:36,425 --> 01:05:40,094
I've been wanting to go
to Baker for a long time.
Yeah. Heard a lot about it.

2372
01:05:36,648 --> 01:05:40,846
很久以来我就想去贝克了
久仰大名

2373
01:05:42,556 --> 01:05:44,098
Excellent seafood.

2374
01:05:42,754 --> 01:05:44,653
那里的海味不错

2375
01:05:46,352 --> 01:05:51,147
You know, I'm thinking,
a guy with your kind of mind
ought to try the land-crab.

2376
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:49,722
我想，像你这样的人…

2377
01:05:49,829 --> 01:05:52,626
应该去尝尝地蟹

2378
01:05:52,691 --> 01:05:54,067
Excellent seafood.

2379
01:05:52,766 --> 01:05:56,098
-很不错的海味
-地蟹

2380
01:05:54,151 --> 01:05:55,568
Land-crab.

2381
01:05:56,070 --> 01:05:58,279
All right. Why not?

2382
01:05:56,236 --> 01:05:59,500
好的，谢谢

2383
01:05:59,365 --> 01:06:01,157
Thanks for the tip.

2384
01:05:59,639 --> 01:06:01,868
谢谢你的小费

2385
01:06:01,784 --> 01:06:03,576
Look at me in the eyes.

2386
01:06:02,008 --> 01:06:04,033
看着我的眼睛

2387
01:06:07,206 --> 01:06:08,665
Everything all right?

2388
01:06:07,414 --> 01:06:09,278
有什么问题吗？

2389
01:06:12,378 --> 01:06:14,879
May I have a little kiss
before you go?

2390
01:06:12,652 --> 01:06:16,315
我可以在走之前吻你吗？

2391
01:06:16,382 --> 01:06:17,924
I'm very lonely here.

2392
01:06:16,457 --> 01:06:18,720
我在这儿很孤单

2393
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:22,804
(SINGING) Oh, Mama

2394
01:06:22,888 --> 01:06:25,974
Can this really be the end?

2395
01:06:26,225 --> 01:06:29,894
DUKE NARRATING: I feIt raped.
The pig had done me
on all fronts.

2396
01:06:26,434 --> 01:06:30,233
我感觉自己受了侮辱
那只猪吻了我的脸

2397
01:06:30,145 --> 01:06:33,481
And now he was going off
to chuckle about it on
the west side of town,

2398
01:06:30,372 --> 01:06:33,499
他现在一定在曼哈顿
西区吃吃地笑…

2399
01:06:33,565 --> 01:06:35,566
waiting for me
to make a run for L.A.

2400
01:06:33,642 --> 01:06:35,040
等着我逃回洛杉矶

2401
01:06:35,310 --> 01:06:37,072
休息区

2402
01:06:37,027 --> 01:06:38,111
Why, yes, Officer.

2403
01:06:37,313 --> 01:06:40,304
是的，长官
我会好好利用休息区的

2404
01:06:38,195 --> 01:06:40,196
Of course l'll take advantage
of that rest area.

2405
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:43,658
And l can't tell you how
grateful l am for this break
you wanna give me.

2406
01:06:40,449 --> 01:06:45,011
对于你给我的这段休息时间
我真不知道该怎么感谢才好

2407
01:06:44,868 --> 01:06:46,244
Get a grip, man.

2408
01:06:45,155 --> 01:06:48,021
好好把握自己，伙计

2409
01:06:47,955 --> 01:06:50,581
lf l boom straight for L.A.
he'll bust me for sure.

2410
01:06:48,158 --> 01:06:51,650
如果我直接回到洛杉矶
他肯定会逮捕我

2411
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:52,959
No.

2412
01:06:51,829 --> 01:06:55,321
不，现在还不是时候摊牌

2413
01:06:53,585 --> 01:06:55,420
This was not the time
for a showdown.

2414
01:06:57,506 --> 01:06:59,257
This was Death Valley.

2415
01:06:57,635 --> 01:06:59,660
这是死谷

2416
01:06:59,842 --> 01:07:01,259
(GASPING)

2417
01:07:02,219 --> 01:07:04,095
DUKE: Oh, fuck!

2418
01:07:02,273 --> 01:07:04,639
见鬼

2419
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:08,266
Sweet Jesus, it's him.
Oh, my God !

2420
01:07:04,776 --> 01:07:07,107
天，是他

2421
01:07:07,245 --> 01:07:09,611
上帝

2422
01:07:10,394 --> 01:07:12,395
(HUMMING)

2423
01:07:12,896 --> 01:07:14,439
(ENGINE STALLING)

2424
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:17,859
Shit! Come on,
you fucking bastard.

2425
01:07:14,853 --> 01:07:18,345
见鬼！
快走，你这该死的机器

2426
01:07:17,943 --> 01:07:21,571
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
I've got to go. I've got to. . .

2427
01:07:18,490 --> 01:07:21,652
上帝，上帝
我得走，我得走

2428
01:07:24,397 --> 01:07:26,557
他们抓住我了，他妈的

2429
01:07:24,575 --> 01:07:26,325
Well, they've nailed me,
goddamn it.

2430
01:07:26,410 --> 01:07:28,870
I'm trapped in
some stinking desert
crossroads called Baker.

2431
01:07:26,732 --> 01:07:29,098
这片讨厌的沙漠
我被困在一个叫贝克的十字路口

2432
01:07:28,954 --> 01:07:30,747
I don't have much time, man.
The fuckers are closing in.

2433
01:07:29,203 --> 01:07:31,898
我没有多少时间了
那群笨蛋快要来了

2434
01:07:30,831 --> 01:07:32,874
They'll hunt me down
like a fucking beast.

2435
01:07:32,039 --> 01:07:35,166
-他们会像野兽似的追捕我
-你是不是有点妄想狂

2436
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,709
GONZO:
You sound a little paranoid.

2437
01:07:34,793 --> 01:07:37,045
I need a fucking lawyer
immediately!

2438
01:07:35,309 --> 01:07:37,334
马上给我派个律师

2439
01:07:37,129 --> 01:07:39,881
What are you doing in Baker?
Didn't you get my telegram?

2440
01:07:37,477 --> 01:07:40,172
你在贝克做什么？
收到我的电报没有？

2441
01:07:39,965 --> 01:07:42,133
What telegram,
you worthless bastard?

2442
01:07:40,314 --> 01:07:44,750
什么电报，
你这个一无是处的王八蛋？

2443
01:07:43,093 --> 01:07:44,677
I'll cripple your ass
for this.

2444
01:07:44,762 --> 01:07:47,847
You brainless scumbag,
you're supposed to be
in Vegas.

2445
01:07:44,886 --> 01:07:48,013
没大脑的人渣
你现在应该在维加斯才对

2446
01:07:47,931 --> 01:07:50,099
I rented a suite
at the Flamingo.

2447
01:07:48,156 --> 01:07:50,248
我在佛朗明哥饭店
为你预订好了房间

2448
01:07:50,350 --> 01:07:54,103
You're supposed to be
covering the National District
Attorney's conference.

2449
01:07:50,391 --> 01:07:54,690
你得去国家检查官
会场弄回一份报道

2450
01:07:54,563 --> 01:07:57,398
l made all the reservations.
Everything is arranged.

2451
01:07:54,830 --> 01:07:58,925
我把一切事情都安排好了

2452
01:07:58,275 --> 01:08:01,986
Now, what the fuck are you
doing out there in the
middle of the desert?

2453
01:07:59,101 --> 01:08:02,468
你现在在那个荒无人烟的
沙漠做什么呢？

2454
01:08:02,446 --> 01:08:05,239
Nothing. Never mind.
It's all a big joke.

2455
01:08:02,571 --> 01:08:05,768
没什么，不用担心
不过是个玩笑

2456
01:08:05,657 --> 01:08:09,118
I'm actually. . .
I'm poolside at the
Flamingo right now,

2457
01:08:05,908 --> 01:08:09,343
事实上，我现在就在
佛朗明哥饭店…

2458
01:08:09,203 --> 01:08:11,954
talking through a portable
phone some dwarf brought
out from the casino.

2459
01:08:09,478 --> 01:08:12,344
用一个侏儒从娱乐场所
拿出来的便携式电话跟你通话

2460
01:08:12,039 --> 01:08:13,748
Yeah,
I have total credit here.

2461
01:08:12,482 --> 01:08:15,679
是的，我在这儿很受人敬重
你最好不要到这个地方来

2462
01:08:13,832 --> 01:08:16,334
Don't come anywhere near
this place, you bastard.

2463
01:08:15,818 --> 01:08:17,682
外国人在这里是很不受欢迎的

2464
01:08:16,418 --> 01:08:17,543
Foreigners
aren't welcome here.

2465
01:08:19,797 --> 01:08:22,715
DUKE NARRATING:
Well, this is
how the world works.

2466
01:08:20,090 --> 01:08:23,718
这个世界就是这么奇妙

2467
01:08:23,509 --> 01:08:26,427
All energy flows
according to the whims
of the Great Magnet.

2468
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:28,125
自有它自己的运转规律

2469
01:08:27,930 --> 01:08:29,972
What a fool l was to defy him.

2470
01:08:28,266 --> 01:08:30,893
跟它作对简直就是个傻瓜

2471
01:08:30,724 --> 01:08:34,018
l was going back to Vegas.
l had no choice.

2472
01:08:31,068 --> 01:08:34,161
我必须再回到维加斯
我别无选择

2473
01:08:34,103 --> 01:08:35,186
(GUN FIRING)

2474
01:08:35,139 --> 01:08:37,072
不要在内华达州赌博

2475
01:08:37,189 --> 01:08:39,148
l had to get rid of the Shark.

2476
01:08:37,476 --> 01:08:39,501
我要甩掉那个骗子

2477
01:08:39,316 --> 01:08:43,236
Too many people
might recognize it,
especially the Vegas police.

2478
01:08:39,645 --> 01:08:43,843
大多数人都应该认识到这一点
特别是维加斯的警察们

2479
01:08:44,947 --> 01:08:47,448
Luckily, my credit card
was still technically valid.

2480
01:08:45,249 --> 01:08:48,980
幸运的是，
我的信用卡还是有效的

2481
01:08:48,867 --> 01:08:51,494
Now this was
a superior machine.

2482
01:08:49,121 --> 01:08:52,283
现在的这个可是个
比较高级的机器

2483
01:08:52,204 --> 01:08:55,456
Ten grand worth
of gimmicks and
high-priced special effects.

2484
01:08:52,425 --> 01:08:56,292
它的利用价值已远远
超过租用它时的一万元

2485
01:08:56,166 --> 01:08:59,669
The rear windows leapt up
with a touch like
frogs in a dynamite pond.

2486
01:08:56,429 --> 01:08:59,796
它的后窗抬起时
感觉就像是池塘里的青蛙

2487
01:08:59,932 --> 01:09:03,299
仪表板上那些深奥的数字…

2488
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:03,214
The dashboard was
full of esoteric lights
and dials and meters

2489
01:09:03,298 --> 01:09:05,383
that l would
never understand.

2490
01:09:03,436 --> 01:09:04,766
我是怎么都不会看得懂的

2491
01:09:05,938 --> 01:09:07,495
如果那群猪在维加斯开会…

2492
01:09:06,385 --> 01:09:08,636
lf the pigs were
gathering in Vegas,

2493
01:09:08,141 --> 01:09:10,074
欢迎来拉斯维加斯
参加国家检查官会议

2494
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:11,389
l felt the drug culture
should be represented as well.

2495
01:09:10,477 --> 01:09:12,137
我感觉毒品文化也会来凑热闹

2496
01:09:12,015 --> 01:09:14,851
And there was a certain
bent appeal in the notion
of running a savage burn

2497
01:09:12,313 --> 01:09:15,213
这一定会在拉斯维加斯…

2498
01:09:14,935 --> 01:09:16,727
on one Las Vegas hotel,

2499
01:09:15,349 --> 01:09:17,213
一家旅馆里喧起一阵龙卷风…

2500
01:09:16,812 --> 01:09:19,897
and then just
wheeling across town
and checking into another.

2501
01:09:17,351 --> 01:09:20,548
然后再跨过另一个州
卷到另一个旅馆

2502
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:23,442
Me and 1 ,000 ranking cops
from all over America.

2503
01:09:20,689 --> 01:09:23,886
我和美国的警察
就都有事做了

2504
01:09:23,777 --> 01:09:26,821
Why not move confidently
into their midst?

2505
01:09:24,025 --> 01:09:27,051
我应该充满信心地
走到他们中间去

2506
01:09:26,905 --> 01:09:28,990
Welcome to
the Flamingo Hotel, sir.

2507
01:09:27,195 --> 01:09:30,652
欢迎来到佛朗明哥饭店

2508
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:31,075
(GRUNTING)

2509
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:33,130
先生？

2510
01:09:32,578 --> 01:09:35,037
Sir?
Yeah, hi. Right. Okay.

2511
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:35,133
好的，是，谢谢

2512
01:09:35,247 --> 01:09:37,331
(SINGING)
Let me stay in your arms

2513
01:09:37,416 --> 01:09:40,042
l'm addicted to your charms

2514
01:09:40,127 --> 01:09:43,171
You're getting to be
a habit with me

2515
01:09:45,174 --> 01:09:48,634
l used to think your love
was something that l

2516
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:50,136
Could take

2517
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:51,345
Or leave alone

2518
01:09:51,321 --> 01:09:54,118
我来的不是时候

2519
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:54,015
DUKE NARRATING: My arrivaI
was badly timed.

2520
01:09:54,099 --> 01:09:57,852
(SINGING) But now I couIdn't
do without my supply

2521
01:09:57,936 --> 01:10:01,063
l need you for my own

2522
01:10:01,131 --> 01:10:04,328
为什么吸毒者不知道这些事实

2523
01:10:07,471 --> 01:10:10,439
这个是我们要用到的模型…

2524
01:10:08,113 --> 01:10:09,780
This here model is one
that we had to use

2525
01:10:09,865 --> 01:10:13,159
when we took on
them little peckerheads
down there at Kent State.

2526
01:10:10,608 --> 01:10:14,008
我们在肯特州雇用了
那些家伙时

2527
01:10:14,036 --> 01:10:15,745
And this baby here. . .

2528
01:10:14,145 --> 01:10:16,578
这里的这个孩子-

2529
01:10:18,516 --> 01:10:21,450
我是密歇根州警察局局长

2530
01:10:18,624 --> 01:10:21,209
I'm a police chief
from Michigan.

2531
01:10:21,293 --> 01:10:23,169
Look, fella,
I have explained to you.

2532
01:10:21,587 --> 01:10:23,612
听着，伙计，
我得跟你说说我的情况

2533
01:10:23,253 --> 01:10:28,674
I have this postcard
which says that I have
a reservation in this hotel.

2534
01:10:23,756 --> 01:10:28,955
这张明信片上说
我有这个饭店的预订房间

2535
01:10:28,842 --> 01:10:32,553
I'm very sorry, sir,
but you're on the late list.

2536
01:10:29,094 --> 01:10:32,790
很抱歉，先生
但是你订单来的太晚了

2537
01:10:32,638 --> 01:10:36,515
And so, your reservation
has been transferred to. . .
It's okay.

2538
01:10:32,932 --> 01:10:37,231
-所以就被转到…
-不要着急

2539
01:10:37,309 --> 01:10:43,272
. . .the Moonlight Motel
which is just out on
Paradise Boulevard.

2540
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:41,066
到…月光汽车旅馆…

2541
01:10:41,207 --> 01:10:43,674
就在天堂林荫大道那边

2542
01:10:43,357 --> 01:10:45,566
We've already paid
for our goddamn room !

2543
01:10:43,811 --> 01:10:46,837
我们已经付过费用了

2544
01:10:45,651 --> 01:10:47,902
Well, it's actually a very
fine place of lodging,

2545
01:10:47,014 --> 01:10:50,005
那里的住房条件相当不错
从这里过16条街就可以了

2546
01:10:47,986 --> 01:10:52,240
and it's only
1 6 blocks from here.
It has a pool, sauna, steam.

2547
01:10:50,151 --> 01:10:52,084
那里有游泳池，
桑拿浴，蒸汽浴

2548
01:10:52,253 --> 01:10:54,584
你给我听清楚
你这个恶心的同性恋者！

2549
01:10:52,324 --> 01:10:54,200
You listen to me,
you filthy little faggot!

2550
01:10:54,284 --> 01:10:56,911
I want a manager down here,
now, now!

2551
01:10:54,722 --> 01:10:57,053
叫你们经理马上下来，马上！

2552
01:10:56,995 --> 01:10:59,789
Now, because I'm sick of
listening to your dog shit!

2553
01:10:57,191 --> 01:11:00,217
我讨厌再听到你的胡言乱语！

2554
01:10:59,873 --> 01:11:03,167
I am very sorry, sir.

2555
01:11:00,361 --> 01:11:03,352
我，非常抱歉，先生

2556
01:11:03,252 --> 01:11:04,919
Get off of me!
Get away from me!

2557
01:11:03,498 --> 01:11:06,364
-放开我，放开我！
-我去为你叫辆计程车？

2558
01:11:05,003 --> 01:11:06,128
Can I call you a cab?

2559
01:11:06,213 --> 01:11:08,172
Sure, and I'll call you
a cocksucker!

2560
01:11:06,501 --> 01:11:08,559
当然，我会叫你同性恋！

2561
01:11:08,257 --> 01:11:11,384
DUKE NARRATING: Of course,
l could hear what the
clerk was really saying.

2562
01:11:08,704 --> 01:11:11,467
是的，我很清楚地
听到那个服务生说

2563
01:11:11,607 --> 01:11:14,598
听着，你这个老不死的

2564
01:11:11,635 --> 01:11:14,387
Listen,
you fuzzy little shithead !

2565
01:11:14,743 --> 01:11:17,905
我一直在这里…

2566
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:17,515
I've been fucked around
in my time

2567
01:11:17,599 --> 01:11:19,809
by a fairly good cross section

2568
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:20,946
忍受着你这个…

2569
01:11:19,893 --> 01:11:23,020
of mean-tempered,
rule-crazy cops.

2570
01:11:21,083 --> 01:11:23,346
脾气暴躁，
有些疯狂的警察的胡闹…

2571
01:11:23,105 --> 01:11:26,357
And now, it's my turn.

2572
01:11:23,454 --> 01:11:26,616
现在…轮到我了

2573
01:11:28,235 --> 01:11:32,321
So fuck you, Officer.
I'm in charge.

2574
01:11:28,524 --> 01:11:32,653
去死吧，长官
我是主管

2575
01:11:32,572 --> 01:11:34,824
Hey, listen,
I really hate to interrupt,

2576
01:11:32,796 --> 01:11:34,660
抱歉，非常抱歉，打断你们…

2577
01:11:34,798 --> 01:11:37,322
但我得先解决我们的事

2578
01:11:34,908 --> 01:11:37,118
but I wonder if I could
just slide on through
and get out of your way.

2579
01:11:37,202 --> 01:11:38,786
The name is Duke. Raoul Duke.

2580
01:11:37,468 --> 01:11:40,095
我是杜克，我想我的律师
已经替我订好房间了

2581
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:41,163
I think my attorney
made the reservations.

2582
01:11:40,238 --> 01:11:42,501
杜克

2583
01:11:41,248 --> 01:11:42,540
Duke, Raoul.

2584
01:11:42,639 --> 01:11:44,664
是的，先生

2585
01:11:42,874 --> 01:11:44,375
Certainly, sir.

2586
01:11:44,501 --> 01:11:48,421
My bags. . . My bags are
out there in that white
Cadillac convertible there.

2587
01:11:44,809 --> 01:11:48,744
我的行李就在外面那辆
白色的卡迪拉克敞蓬车里

2588
01:11:48,505 --> 01:11:50,381
Maybe somebody could
bring it to the room for me.

2589
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,676
一会，可以让人替我送上去

2590
01:11:50,465 --> 01:11:55,052
Well, let me get
a quart of Wild Turkey,

2591
01:11:50,816 --> 01:11:55,185
好的，再给我来一瓶WildTurKey…

2592
01:11:55,287 --> 01:11:57,254
五分之二的巴卡第…

2593
01:11:55,387 --> 01:11:58,931
two-fifths of Bacardi,
some ice for the room,
and let's see. . .

2594
01:11:57,423 --> 01:12:00,085
-再给房间里送点冰块，
再想想--不要冲动！

2595
01:11:59,016 --> 01:12:00,099
You just calm down !

2596
01:12:00,183 --> 01:12:02,018
Shit, let's try
some lime chunks.
What do you think?

2597
01:12:00,226 --> 01:12:02,318
另外，来点酸橙
可以吧？

2598
01:12:02,461 --> 01:12:04,860
没问题

2599
01:12:02,644 --> 01:12:03,894
I say okay.

2600
01:12:04,997 --> 01:12:08,194
-你不用担心
-好的，冷静点

2601
01:12:05,689 --> 01:12:07,189
You don't worry
about a thing.

2602
01:12:07,274 --> 01:12:08,316
Now, calm down.

2603
01:12:08,335 --> 01:12:11,532
有什么事的话，尽管叫我-斯芬

2604
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:11,736
You don't hesitate
to call me, Sven.

2605
01:12:11,671 --> 01:12:13,535
好的，斯芬

2606
01:12:12,612 --> 01:12:13,821
All right, Sven.

2607
01:12:13,673 --> 01:12:16,506
非常感谢

2608
01:12:13,905 --> 01:12:15,114
(WAILING)

2609
01:12:15,198 --> 01:12:16,324
Thank you very much.

2610
01:12:16,408 --> 01:12:17,783
You. . . You. . .

2611
01:12:16,643 --> 01:12:19,509
-你-你-
-我理解，我理解，我理解

2612
01:12:17,868 --> 01:12:20,161
I know, I know, I know.
It's hideous.

2613
01:12:19,646 --> 01:12:23,240
这种事真是很讨厌
但一切都会好起来的，你不错

2614
01:12:20,245 --> 01:12:22,121
You're gonna be fine, though.
You're doing well.

2615
01:12:23,165 --> 01:12:25,041
I'll see you later. Wait.
Don't touch it.

2616
01:12:23,383 --> 01:12:25,247
再见
等等，不要碰

2617
01:12:25,125 --> 01:12:27,585
Good night. Pardon me.
Bye, Sven.

2618
01:12:25,419 --> 01:12:28,410
晚安，请让让，再见，斯芬

2619
01:12:27,711 --> 01:12:29,086
(CRYING)

2620
01:12:28,556 --> 01:12:33,185
看看你都做了些什么，
你都做了些什么

2621
01:12:29,629 --> 01:12:32,923
Look what you did !
Look what you did !

2622
01:12:33,008 --> 01:12:36,719
Goddamn you,
we wouldn't stay in this
hotel if you begged us!

2623
01:12:33,327 --> 01:12:36,955
妈的，现在就算你求我
我们也不住这家饭店了

2624
01:12:36,803 --> 01:12:40,431
(SINGING) Magic moments

2625
01:12:41,141 --> 01:12:45,269
When two hearts are caring

2626
01:12:45,812 --> 01:12:50,274
Magic moments

2627
01:12:50,567 --> 01:12:53,402
Memories we've been sharing

2628
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:55,673
家，温馨的家

2629
01:12:53,737 --> 01:12:56,530
Home, sweet home. Whoa.
What kind of sick shit. . .

Remember what happened
at the airport, okay?
Come on.

The child in the bedroom.

-房里的那个孩子
-露西

2715
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:35,022
Oh, Lucy.
I met her on the plane.

2716
01:15:33,554 --> 01:15:35,418
我是在飞机上遇到她的

2717
01:15:37,817 --> 01:15:40,444
Yeah.
She's a religious freak.

2718
01:15:38,026 --> 01:15:41,620
是的，她信教

2719
01:15:41,571 --> 01:15:44,198
I gave her a cap
before I realized. . .

2720
01:15:41,763 --> 01:15:44,560
我给了她点迷幻药-

2721
01:15:44,282 --> 01:15:46,325
Jesus, she's never even
had a drink.

2722
01:15:44,734 --> 01:15:47,327
天，后来才知道
她还从没喝过酒

2723
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:49,630
好吧，也许这是个解决的方法

2724
01:15:47,827 --> 01:15:49,328
DUKE: Well,
it'll probably work out.

2725
01:15:49,412 --> 01:15:52,289
We can keep her loaded,
and then peddle her ass
at the drug convention.

2726
01:15:49,771 --> 01:15:52,898
我们让她先沉迷在药品里
然后把她放到毒品大会上去叫卖

2727
01:15:52,374 --> 01:15:54,500
Yeah,
she's perfect for this gig.

2728
01:15:53,042 --> 01:15:55,771
不错，她很适合做这个

2729
01:15:55,627 --> 01:15:56,752
These cops'll go
50 bucks a head

2730
01:15:55,911 --> 01:15:59,938
这些警察会50元买袋毒品
然后干她

2731
01:15:56,836 --> 01:15:59,213
to beat her into submission
and then gang-fuck her.

2732
01:15:59,839 --> 01:16:02,007
We can set her up
in one of these
backstreet motels,

2733
01:16:00,082 --> 01:16:02,379
我们可以在后街小巷里开一家店…

2734
01:16:02,092 --> 01:16:04,260
hang pictures of Jesus
all over the room,

2735
01:16:02,519 --> 01:16:06,784
在房间里挂满耶稣像
然后让她跟那群猪干

2736
01:16:04,344 --> 01:16:06,554
and then turn these
fucking pigs loose on her.

2737
01:16:06,638 --> 01:16:08,889
Hell, she's strong, man.
She'll hold her own.

2738
01:16:06,923 --> 01:16:09,891
她很健康
一定吃得消

2739
01:16:11,194 --> 01:16:13,560
天，我知道你很恶心…

2740
01:16:11,309 --> 01:16:13,310
Jesus Christ,
I knew you were sick,

2741
01:16:13,395 --> 01:16:17,231
but I never expected to
hear you actually say
that kind of stuff.

2742
01:16:13,698 --> 01:16:17,463
但我并不想从你的嘴里
说出这么脏的话来

2743
01:16:17,315 --> 01:16:18,399
You filthy bastard.

2744
01:16:17,635 --> 01:16:21,764
-你这个王八蛋，-从经济学上
来讲，她是上帝送来的礼物

2745
01:16:18,483 --> 01:16:21,777
Straight economics, man.
This girl's a godsend.

2746
01:16:21,906 --> 01:16:24,739
妈的，
她一天就可以让我们赚一千

2747
01:16:22,487 --> 01:16:24,530
Shit. She could make us
a grand a day.

2748
01:16:24,614 --> 01:16:27,700
That's ugly, man.
Stop talking like that.

2749
01:16:24,876 --> 01:16:27,969
好了，这真是太可耻了
不要再说种话

2750
01:16:28,113 --> 01:16:31,411
我想她一次
至少可以干四个人

2751
01:16:28,743 --> 01:16:30,995
Well, I figure she can do
about four at a time.

2752
01:16:31,121 --> 01:16:35,416
If we keep her full of acid,
that's more like two grand
a day, maybe three.

2753
01:16:31,550 --> 01:16:35,679
只要我们让她吃足迷幻药
我们一天可以赚两千或更多

2754
01:16:38,824 --> 01:16:40,688
住口，伙计

2755
01:16:39,045 --> 01:16:40,421
Hold on, man.

2756
01:16:40,505 --> 01:16:43,465
What if I just jump on you
and beat the dog shit
out of you?

2757
01:16:40,826 --> 01:16:43,692
我真该把你揍一顿
让你不要再说这些屁话？

2758
01:16:43,592 --> 01:16:46,093
Would that make
you feel any better,
you filthy bastard?

2759
01:16:43,829 --> 01:16:46,524
你认为，
这样子是不是更好呢？

2760
01:16:46,177 --> 01:16:47,636
All right, listen to me.

2761
01:16:46,666 --> 01:16:48,530
好的，听我说

2762
01:16:48,471 --> 01:16:51,098
In a few hours,
she'll probably be sane
enough to work herself

2763
01:16:48,668 --> 01:16:51,431
几个小时后，她马上就会
清醒过来…

2764
01:16:51,182 --> 01:16:53,100
into some sort of towering
Jesus-based rage

2765
01:16:51,604 --> 01:16:55,403
她会很模糊地记起…

2766
01:16:53,184 --> 01:16:58,063
at the hazy recollection
of being seduced by
some kind of cruel Samoan

2767
01:16:55,508 --> 01:16:58,705
一个很野蛮的萨摩亚人诱使她…

2768
01:16:58,607 --> 01:17:00,065
who fed her liquor and LSD,

2769
01:16:58,846 --> 01:17:02,713
喝酒吃迷幻药
把她带到维加斯一家旅馆…

2770
01:17:00,525 --> 01:17:02,401
dragged her
to a Vegas hotel room

2771
01:17:02,485 --> 01:17:06,238
and then savagely
penetrated every orifice
in her little body

2772
01:17:02,851 --> 01:17:06,343
然后用他那异教徒的方式…

2773
01:17:06,323 --> 01:17:09,366
with his throbbing,
uncircumcised member.

2774
01:17:06,488 --> 01:17:09,547
践踏她幼小的身躯

2775
01:17:09,691 --> 01:17:11,988
这真是太恶心了

2776
01:17:09,868 --> 01:17:11,785
(WOMAN GASPING)
That's so ugly, man.

2777
01:17:11,870 --> 01:17:13,829
Well, fuck, truth hurts.
That's "Argh !"

2778
01:17:12,127 --> 01:17:14,117
-妈的，这是事实
-那真是太恶心了！

2779
01:17:13,913 --> 01:17:14,955
Yeah.
Argh !

2780
01:17:14,263 --> 01:17:16,526
-是的
-恶心！那真是太恶心了

2781
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:17,207
That's argh ! Argh !

-恶心！
-恶心？

如果他能知道发生了什么…

then he can rise one notch

convince himself

01:21:45,643 --> 01:21:49,438
then he becomes groovy.

2930
01:21:45,753 --> 01:21:49,449
然后就可以说
他进入最佳状态了

2931
01:21:49,591 --> 01:21:51,455
最佳状态

he can actually raise himself

01:21:53,362 --> 01:21:56,762
然后，过了这一阶段
他还可以提升自己…

-这个东西…

3095
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:11,295
可以让纯霉斯卡灵
看起来像啤酒

3096
01:26:06,737 --> 01:26:11,449
makes pure mescaline
seem like ginger beer, man.

3097
01:26:12,910 --> 01:26:14,619
Adrenochrome.

3098
01:26:13,106 --> 01:26:16,563
-肾上腺素红肾上腺素红？

3099
01:26:14,745 --> 01:26:16,454
Adrenochrome? Hmm.

3100
01:26:16,581 --> 01:26:17,789
(PHONE RINGS)

3101
01:26:24,130 --> 01:26:25,255
Hello.

3102
01:26:24,619 --> 01:26:27,314
喂

3103
01:26:27,258 --> 01:26:29,009
Hi, Lucy. God bless.

3104
01:26:27,456 --> 01:26:30,982
嗨，露西，上帝保佑

3105
01:26:29,552 --> 01:26:30,844
Hmm?

3106
01:26:30,928 --> 01:26:32,637
Yeah, it's me.

3107
01:26:31,126 --> 01:26:33,025
是的，是我

3108
01:26:32,722 --> 01:26:36,600
Hell, no,
I taught the bastard a lesson
he'll never forget.

3109
01:26:33,162 --> 01:26:36,996
什么？不.
我已经教训过那个杂种了

3110
01:26:36,934 --> 01:26:40,103
What? No, not dead.

3111
01:26:37,132 --> 01:26:40,294
什么？不，没死

3112
01:26:40,271 --> 01:26:43,481
But he won't be bothering
anybody for a while.

3113
01:26:40,437 --> 01:26:43,599
但他现在
不会烦任何一个人了

3114
01:26:43,566 --> 01:26:45,859
Yeah, I left him out there.

3115
01:26:43,739 --> 01:26:45,968
是的，我让他出去了

3116
01:26:45,943 --> 01:26:47,736
I stomped him.

3117
01:26:46,108 --> 01:26:49,771
我揍了他一顿
拔光了他所有的牙

3118
01:26:48,321 --> 01:26:50,030
I pulled all his teeth out.

3119
01:26:49,914 --> 01:26:51,778
我记得想上帝…

3120
01:26:50,114 --> 01:26:51,656
DUKE NARRATING:
l remember thinking,
"Jesus.

3121
01:26:51,741 --> 01:26:54,326
"What a terrible thing
to lay on somebody
with a head full of acid."

3122
01:26:51,948 --> 01:26:54,439
让一个人吃那么多迷幻药
是多么可怕的一件事啊

3123
01:26:54,410 --> 01:26:56,161
But we have a problem.

3124
01:26:54,584 --> 01:26:56,448
但我们遇到麻烦了

3125
01:26:56,245 --> 01:26:58,580
That bastard cashed
a bad check downstairs

3126
01:26:56,586 --> 01:27:00,817
那个杂种欠下了一屁股债
而且把你也牵涉进去了

3127
01:26:58,664 --> 01:27:00,707
and gave you as a reference.

3128
01:27:00,791 --> 01:27:03,168
They'll be
looking for both of you.

3129
01:27:00,957 --> 01:27:03,720
他们会找你们俩麻烦的

3130
01:27:03,669 --> 01:27:07,714
Yeah, I know,
Lucy, but you can't
judge a book by its cover.

3131
01:27:03,862 --> 01:27:07,854
是的，，露西，但你总不能
根据书的封面来判断它的内容

3132
01:27:07,798 --> 01:27:10,717
Some people are
just basically rotten.

3133
01:27:07,998 --> 01:27:10,761
有些人真的是很渣

3134
01:27:12,470 --> 01:27:14,429
Anyway, the last thing
in the world you wanna do

3135
01:27:12,571 --> 01:27:17,269
不管怎么样，
以后你不要再往这里打电话了

3136
01:27:14,513 --> 01:27:16,848
is call this hotel again.

3137
01:27:17,308 --> 01:27:19,309
They'll trace the call,
put you straight behind bars.

3138
01:27:17,409 --> 01:27:21,538
他们会窃听这个电话
然后把你抓起来

3139
01:27:19,393 --> 01:27:20,644
(BABBLING)

3140
01:27:21,562 --> 01:27:23,813
No, I'm moving
to the Tropicana right away.

3141
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:24,648
不，我会去热带天堂酒店

3142
01:27:26,150 --> 01:27:27,275
Hmm.

3143
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:30,445
I'll use a different name.
I'll let you know what it is.

3144
01:27:28,287 --> 01:27:31,619
我会用个假名
到时候再告诉你

3145
01:27:35,117 --> 01:27:36,660
I gotta get off.

3146
01:27:35,595 --> 01:27:37,926
我要走了

3147
01:27:37,703 --> 01:27:40,664
Probably have this phone
tapped, baby.

3148
01:27:38,064 --> 01:27:40,930
也许这个电话有分机

3149
01:27:40,957 --> 01:27:42,999
Yeah, I know,
it was horrible,
but it's all over now.

3150
01:27:41,067 --> 01:27:45,025
-是的，我知道.这很恐怖
但现在一切都过去了

3151
01:27:43,084 --> 01:27:44,292
(BANGING)

3152
01:27:45,044 --> 01:27:47,712
Oh, my God.
There's someone at the door.

3153
01:27:45,172 --> 01:27:48,106
上帝，有人在敲门

3154
01:27:47,797 --> 01:27:48,755
(SQUEALING)

3155
01:27:48,243 --> 01:27:52,145
有人在敲门

3156
01:27:48,839 --> 01:27:50,215
(WHISPERING)
There's someone at the door.

3157
01:27:50,299 --> 01:27:51,549
(BANGING)

3158
01:27:52,279 --> 01:27:55,577
救世主

3159
01:27:52,718 --> 01:27:54,719
Christ! Hey!

3160
01:27:55,388 --> 01:27:58,181
No! I'm innocent!
It was Duke!

3161
01:27:55,717 --> 01:27:58,514
不，我是无辜的，那是杜克

3162
01:27:58,266 --> 01:28:01,559
It was Duke! Lucy! Lucy!

3163
01:27:58,686 --> 01:28:02,053
是杜克，露西，露西

3164
01:28:01,644 --> 01:28:04,020
I love you ! I love you !

3165
01:28:04,188 --> 01:28:05,563
(SCREAMING)

3166
01:28:10,528 --> 01:28:11,861
Don't put that thing on me!

3167
01:28:10,566 --> 01:28:14,797
不要把那东西放在我身上

3168
01:28:11,946 --> 01:28:13,530
(SCREAMING)

3169
01:28:18,619 --> 01:28:22,038
Whoo. Oh.

3170
01:28:22,164 --> 01:28:23,873
Well. . .

3171
01:28:25,293 --> 01:28:27,377
That's that.

3172
01:28:25,682 --> 01:28:27,979
搞定

3173
01:28:27,628 --> 01:28:28,628
(GURGLING)

3174
01:28:28,118 --> 01:28:32,645
你以后再也不会
听到她的声音了

3175
01:28:28,713 --> 01:28:31,589
That's the last we should
be hearing from Lucy, man.

3176
01:28:32,508 --> 01:28:33,633
(EXHALES)

3177
01:28:35,428 --> 01:28:39,347
She's probably
stuffing herself down
the incinerator about now.

3178
01:28:35,492 --> 01:28:39,861
她现在一定吓得要死

3179
01:28:42,977 --> 01:28:44,602
You know what we need?

3180
01:28:43,035 --> 01:28:45,002
你知道我们需要什么吗？

3181
01:28:44,687 --> 01:28:46,271
We need some opium.

3182
01:28:45,137 --> 01:28:47,503
我们需要一些鸦片

3183
01:28:55,323 --> 01:28:56,406
(GURGLING)

3184
01:28:58,242 --> 01:29:00,285
DUKE NARRATING: I remember
slumping on the bed.

3185
01:28:58,584 --> 01:29:00,609
我记得从床上掉下来了

3186
01:29:00,369 --> 01:29:02,787
His performance
had given me a bad jolt.

3187
01:29:00,752 --> 01:29:03,118
他的表演让我有些晕

3188
01:29:02,955 --> 01:29:05,707
For a moment, l thought
his mind had snapped,

3189
01:29:03,256 --> 01:29:05,951
那一刻，我以为这种想法
一下抓住了我…

3190
01:29:05,791 --> 01:29:09,002
that he actually believed
he was being attacked
by invisible enemies.

3191
01:29:06,125 --> 01:29:09,025
他真的相信他被一个
看不见的敌人攻击了

3192
01:29:09,128 --> 01:29:12,528
但房间很快又安静下来了

3193
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:11,421
But the room was quiet again.

3194
01:29:13,866 --> 01:29:15,730
你从哪弄来这个的？

3195
01:29:13,883 --> 01:29:15,800
Where'd you get this?

3196
01:29:15,868 --> 01:29:19,132
不用紧张，
那可是真正的玩意儿

3197
01:29:15,885 --> 01:29:18,345
Never mind.
It's absolutely pure.

3198
01:29:19,273 --> 01:29:22,139
你最近在跟什么人鬼混？

3199
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:22,182
What kind of monster client
have you hooked up
with this time?

3200
01:29:22,266 --> 01:29:24,225
Satanism freak.

3201
01:29:22,276 --> 01:29:24,140
恶魔

3202
01:29:24,278 --> 01:29:27,144
这种东西只可能有一个来源-

3203
01:29:24,602 --> 01:29:26,269
I think there's only
one source for this stuff,

3204
01:29:26,354 --> 01:29:29,814
the adrenaline gland

3205
01:29:27,281 --> 01:29:30,078
是从一个活人身上…

3206
01:29:29,899 --> 01:29:33,151
from a living human body.

3207
01:29:30,218 --> 01:29:33,415
的腺里弄到的

3208
01:29:33,555 --> 01:29:37,991
我知道，那个家伙
没有现金付给我

3209
01:29:33,569 --> 01:29:35,028
I know.

3210
01:29:35,154 --> 01:29:37,364
The guy didn't have
any cash to pay me.

3211
01:29:37,990 --> 01:29:41,993
He offered me human blood,
said it would take me higher
than I'd ever been in my life.

3212
01:29:38,126 --> 01:29:41,960
他给了我一些血，
说会让我进入到一种
从没体验过的境界里

3213
01:29:42,064 --> 01:29:44,463
我以为他在开玩笑

3214
01:29:42,578 --> 01:29:44,537
I thought
he was kidding.
Oh.

3215
01:29:44,622 --> 01:29:48,583
So I told him I'd just
as soon have an ounce
or so of pure adrenochrome.

3216
01:29:44,634 --> 01:29:49,502
所以我就跟他说
我要一些少量的肾上腺素红…

3217
01:29:49,627 --> 01:29:52,420
Or maybe just
a fresh adrenaline gland

3218
01:29:49,639 --> 01:29:52,368
或者是一些新鲜的肾上腺…

3219
01:29:52,505 --> 01:29:53,963
to chew on.

3220
01:29:52,508 --> 01:29:54,372
考虑考虑吧

3221
01:29:54,131 --> 01:29:56,966
DUKE NARRATING: I couId
already feel the stuff
working on me.

3222
01:29:54,511 --> 01:29:57,308
我可以感觉到它已经
在我身体里起作用了

3223
01:29:57,093 --> 01:30:00,637
The first wave felt
like a combination
of mescaline and methedrine.

3224
01:29:57,446 --> 01:30:01,575
每一阵感觉就像霉斯卡灵
和梅太德林的双重效力

3225
01:30:01,472 --> 01:30:03,890
Maybe l should take a swim,
l thought.

3226
01:30:01,718 --> 01:30:04,185
我想，也许我该去游泳

3227
01:30:03,974 --> 01:30:05,809
Yes, sir.

3228
01:30:04,321 --> 01:30:06,185
是的，先生

3229
01:30:07,686 --> 01:30:12,357
They nailed this guy
for child molesting.

3230
01:30:08,259 --> 01:30:11,922
他们逮捕了他
说他骚扰儿童

3231
01:30:13,109 --> 01:30:14,943
He swore he didn't do it.

3232
01:30:13,531 --> 01:30:15,430
他发誓说他没有做过

3233
01:30:15,027 --> 01:30:18,947
"Why should I fuck
with children?" he said.
"They're too small."

3234
01:30:15,567 --> 01:30:19,366
“我干嘛要骚扰儿童？''
他说”他们末免也太小了点''

3235
01:30:19,031 --> 01:30:20,115
(WHINING)

3236
01:30:19,504 --> 01:30:21,870
天，我还能说些什么？

3237
01:30:20,199 --> 01:30:21,408
Christ, what could I say?

3238
01:30:21,492 --> 01:30:24,994
Even a goddamn werewolf
is entitled to legal counsel.

3239
01:30:22,007 --> 01:30:26,205
像这样一种恶魔都有权力
请一个辨护律师

3240
01:30:25,830 --> 01:30:28,206
I didn't dare to
turn the creep down.

3241
01:30:26,345 --> 01:30:29,371
会不怕吗

3242
01:30:30,949 --> 01:30:35,147
他也许会拿起一把刀
然后剖开我的…

3243
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:34,087
He might have
picked up a letter opener
and gone after my

3244
01:30:35,131 --> 01:30:36,214
pineal gland.

3245
01:30:35,287 --> 01:30:37,811
松果腺

3246
01:30:37,758 --> 01:30:39,592
You know?
Yeah.

3247
01:30:37,957 --> 01:30:39,890
-你知道吗？
-什么

3248
01:30:39,677 --> 01:30:41,761
Crazy.
Why not?

3249

-你被捕了！
-她一定是偷偷溜进来的

3425
01:35:54,616 --> 01:35:55,908
I was polishing my shoes
in the closet

3426
01:35:54,663 --> 01:35:58,030
我在壁橱里给我的鞋子打光
发现她偷偷溜进来
所以我就把她抓住了

sneaking in, so I took her.

you were just here

她说的也许是实话
可能不是他们一伙的

So do we.

I think we should
put her on the payroll,

that you say anything
about this to anybody

说一句这里的事…

you will go straight to prison
for the rest of your life.

01:37:03,471 --> 01:37:06,166
就准备后半生
待在监狱里去吧

but you'll have no problem
recognizing him.

will pay you in cash.

Oh, Lord ! I'd do just about
anything for that.

3500

You and a lot
of other people.

-到这边来

you say, "I fear nothing."

你就说“”我所向无敌''

to make up the room.

你不用担心这里的卫生

3518
01:37:57,781 --> 01:38:01,075
Just leave a pile of towels
and soap outside the door
exactly at midnight.

3519

只要每天午夜在门口
放上毛巾和肥皂就可以了

have to risk another

他小时候总想逃跑
然后进马戏团

Now the son of a bitch
owns the circus.

而他现在已经
拥有了整个戏团

of a whole lifestyle

3868
01:51:11,078 --> 01:51:13,944
李尔他记下的不过是
是他创造的…

3869
01:51:13,743 --> 01:51:15,285
that he helped create.

3870
01:51:14,082 --> 01:51:16,174
一个生活方式的幻想

3871
01:51:15,870 --> 01:51:18,330
A generation
of permanent cripples,

3872
01:51:16,318 --> 01:51:18,615
这一代他们是永久的跛子…

3873
01:51:18,414 --> 01:51:19,748
failed seekers,

3874
01:51:18,754 --> 01:51:20,653
他们探求失败…

3875
01:51:20,083 --> 01:51:24,127
who never understood
the essential old-mystic
fallacy of the acid culture.

3876
01:51:20,790 --> 01:51:25,055
他们永远都不会理解
这个古老神秘的毒品文化的本质：

3877
01:51:25,088 --> 01:51:26,546
The desperate assumption

3878
01:51:25,161 --> 01:51:28,061
这种绝望的设想
有些人…

3879
01:51:26,631 --> 01:51:29,841
that somebody
or at least some force

3880
01:51:28,231 --> 01:51:30,130
或者至少有某些力量…

3881
01:51:29,926 --> 01:51:32,678
is tending the light
at the end of the tunnel.

3882
01:51:30,266 --> 01:51:32,961
在这条隧道的心头看管着灯火

3883
01:51:35,338 --> 01:51:39,273
小心开车，马上回来

3884
01:51:39,602 --> 01:51:42,020
There was only one road
back to L.A.

3885
01:51:40,044 --> 01:51:42,307
为上唯一
一条能返回洛杉矶的公路

3886
01:51:42,105 --> 01:51:44,481
U.S. lnterstate 1 5.

3887
01:51:42,446 --> 01:51:45,380
美国州际15号道

3888
01:51:44,565 --> 01:51:48,485
Just a flat out
high-speed burn through
Baker and Barstow and Berdoo.

3889
01:51:45,517 --> 01:51:49,384
当你以高速疲惫不堪地
穿过贝克，巴斯托和帕多后

3890
01:51:48,945 --> 01:51:50,195
Then onto
the Hollywood Freeway,

3891
01:51:49,521 --> 01:51:52,045
就上了好莱坞高速公路
就陷入了一种狂乱的意识中…

3892
01:51:50,279 --> 01:51:51,571
straight into
frantic oblivion,

3893
01:51:51,656 --> 01:51:54,241
safety, obscurity.

3894
01:51:52,189 --> 01:51:54,418
安全，偏僻

3895
01:51:54,325 --> 01:51:57,327
Just another freak
in the freak kingdom.

3896
01:51:54,560 --> 01:51:57,619
只是另外一种奇怪的东西…
在这片奇怪的王国领土下


3897
01:51:57,412 --> 01:52:02,124
(SINGING) I was born
in a cross-fire hurricane

3898
01:52:04,293 --> 01:52:09,798
But l howled at my ma
in the driving rain

3899
01:52:11,384 --> 01:52:16,096
But it's all right now

3900
01:52:16,180 --> 01:52:18,390
ln fact, it's a gas

3901
01:52:18,474 --> 01:52:22,185
But it's all right

3902
01:52:22,270 --> 01:52:25,772
l'm Jumpin' Jack Flash.
lt's a gas, gas, gas.

3903
01:52:35,491 --> 01:52:40,662
l was raised by a toothless,
bearded hag

3904
01:52:42,832 --> 01:52:48,128
l was schooled with a strap
right across my back

3905
01:52:49,839 --> 01:52:54,593
But it's all right now

3906
01:52:54,677 --> 01:52:56,845
ln fact, it's a gas

3907
01:52:56,929 --> 01:53:00,682
But it's all right

3908
01:53:00,767 --> 01:53:04,561
l'm Jumpin' Jack Flash.
lt's a gas, gas, gas

3909
01:53:33,508 --> 01:53:38,929
l was drowned
l was washed up
and left for dead

3910
01:53:40,556 --> 01:53:42,849
l fell down to my feet

3911
01:53:42,934 --> 01:53:45,977
And l saw they bled

3912
01:53:46,062 --> 01:53:49,147
Yeah, yeah
l frowned

3913
01:53:49,232 --> 01:53:52,984
At the crumbs
of a crust of bread

3914
01:53:53,069 --> 01:53:56,071
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
l was crowned

3915
01:53:56,155 --> 01:53:59,908
With a spike
right through my head

3916
01:53:59,992 --> 01:54:01,326
Yeah, yeah, yeah

3917
01:54:01,410 --> 01:54:06,289
But it's all right now

3918
01:54:06,374 --> 01:54:08,333
ln fact, it's a gas

3919
01:54:08,417 --> 01:54:12,337
But it's all right

3920
01:54:12,421 --> 01:54:16,299
l'm Jumpin' Jack Flash.
lt's a gas, gas, gas

3921
01:54:19,679 --> 01:54:36,987
Jumpin' Jack Flash.
lt's a gas

3922
01:54:37,071 --> 01:54:40,448
Jumpin' Jack Flash.
lt's a gas.

3923
01:55:43,012 --> 01:55:45,722
(SINGING) Bright Iight city
gonna set my soul

3924
01:55:45,806 --> 01:55:49,017
lt's gonna set my soul on fire

3925
01:55:49,101 --> 01:55:52,103
l got a whole lotta money
that's a-ready to burn

3926
01:55:52,188 --> 01:55:55,273
So get those stakes up high

3927
01:55:55,358 --> 01:55:58,985
There's a thousand
pretty women waitin' out there

3928
01:55:59,070 --> 01:56:02,113
They're all waitin'
The devil may care

3929
01:56:02,198 --> 01:56:05,283
And l'm just a devil
with love to spare

3930
01:56:05,368 --> 01:56:08,703
So Viva Las Vegas

3931
01:56:08,788 --> 01:56:14,918
Viva Las Vegas

3932
01:56:16,837 --> 01:56:19,381
How l wish that
there were more

3933
01:56:19,465 --> 01:56:23,051
Than the 24 hours in the day

3934
01:56:23,135 --> 01:56:25,762
Even if l ran out of sleep

3935
01:56:25,846 --> 01:56:28,807
Boy, l wouldn't
sleep a minute away

3936
01:56:28,891 --> 01:56:32,394
Oh, there's blackjack
and poker
and the roulette wheel

3937
01:56:32,478 --> 01:56:35,772
A fortune won and lost
on every deal

3938
01:56:35,856 --> 01:56:38,650
All you need's a strong heart
and nerves of steel

3939
01:56:38,734 --> 01:56:42,278
So Viva Las Vegas

3940
01:56:42,363 --> 01:56:48,493
Viva Las Vegas

3941
01:56:48,577 --> 01:56:51,454
Viva Las Vegas
where the neon signs
are flashing

3942
01:56:51,539 --> 01:56:53,456
And the one-armed
bandits crashing

3943
01:56:53,541 --> 01:56:56,292
All those hopes
down the drain

3944
01:56:56,377 --> 01:56:59,254
Viva Las Vegas
turning day into nighttime

3945
01:56:59,338 --> 01:57:01,006
Turning night into daytime

3946
01:57:01,090 --> 01:57:05,260
lf you see it once
you'll never be the same again

3947
01:57:07,179 --> 01:57:10,181
l gotta keep on runnin'
Gonna have me some fun

3948
01:57:10,266 --> 01:57:13,393
lf it costs me
my very last dime

3949
01:57:13,477 --> 01:57:16,521
lf l wind up broke
then l'll always remember

3950
01:57:16,605 --> 01:57:19,357
That l had a swingin' time

3951
01:57:19,442 --> 01:57:23,069
Oh, l'm gonna give it

Lady Luck's with me,

01:57:26,198 --> 01:57:29,075
Got coke up my nose
