unless we have unlimited credit.

when the Stingray in front of us
killed a pedestrian.

162

We had trouble again
with the car rental agency.

Mr. Duke, we're all settled.

Hancock, you're on your way.

up materials and packing the car.

Then we ate some mescaline
and went swimming.

Our trip was different.

181
00:10:23,696 --> 00:10:25,628
It was to be

in the national character...

I needed something
to cut the limes, man.

756
00:40:38,149 --> 00:40:41,242
Limes?
What limes?

757
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:44,515
They didn't have any.
They don't grow in the desert.

We'd had a problem with her
in the elevator a few hours earlier.

[Duke Narrating] One of
the things you learn after years
of dealing with drug people...

833
00:44:30,636 --> 00:44:33,569
is that you can
turn your back on a person...

834
00:44:33,639 --> 00:44:36,572
but never turn your back
on a drug...

835
00:44:36,643 --> 00:44:39,770
especially when it's waving
a razor-sharp hunting knife in your eye.

What was the meaning
of this trip?

841
00:44:53,158 --> 00:44:56,593
Was I just roaming around
in a drug frenzy of some kind...

842
00:44:56,661 --> 00:45:00,595
or had I really come out here
to Las Vegas to work on a story?

00:57:39,736 --> 00:57:42,169
Don't move, man.
Be very still.

1060
00:57:42,238 --> 00:57:44,171
There we go.

1061
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,173
Say nothing
to no one, man.

1062
00:57:46,242 --> 00:57:49,403
# Open up the window
Let some air into this room #

1063
00:57:49,479 --> 00:57:53,914
[Duke Narrating] The decision
to flee came suddenly. Or maybe not.

1064
00:57:53,983 --> 00:57:58,043
- # That cigarette you're smokin'
'bout scared me half to death #
- Maybe I'd planned it all along,

1065
00:57:58,121 --> 00:58:00,487
subconsciously waiting
for the right moment.

1066
00:58:00,558 --> 00:58:03,424
- # Mama told me not to come #
- The bill was a factor, I think...

1067
00:58:03,494 --> 00:58:06,291
- because I had no money to pay for it.
- # Mama told me not to come #

1068
00:58:06,364 --> 00:58:10,299
Our room service tabs had been
running somewhere between
29 and 36 dollars per hour...

1069
00:58:10,367 --> 00:58:13,301
- # That ain't the way
to have fun, son #
- for 48 consecutive hours.

1070
00:58:13,371 --> 00:58:15,304
- Incredible.
- # That ain't the way to have fun #

1071
00:58:15,372 --> 00:58:17,305
How could it happen?

1072
00:58:17,374 --> 00:58:21,742
But by the time I asked this question,
there was no one around to answer it.

1073
00:58:21,813 --> 00:58:24,940
That rotten attorney of mine,
Dr. Gonzo, was gone.

1074
00:58:25,017 --> 00:58:26,950
He must have sensed trouble.

1075
00:58:27,018 --> 00:58:28,848
Hmm? Ohh.

1076
00:58:28,921 --> 00:58:30,751
A "Z"?

1077
00:58:30,823 --> 00:58:32,880
Panic.

1078
00:58:33,192 --> 00:58:37,786
It crept up my spine like
first-rising vibes of an acid frenzy.

1079
00:58:37,864 --> 00:58:41,799
- [Bell Dings]
- All these horrible realities
began to dawn on me.

1080
00:58:41,867 --> 00:58:44,595
[Duke]
Oh, fuck.

1081
00:58:44,671 --> 00:58:46,604
Here I was...

1082
00:58:46,673 --> 00:58:49,732
alone in Las Vegas,
completely twisted on drugs.

1083
00:58:49,809 --> 00:58:53,107
No cash,
no story for the magazine...

1084
00:58:53,181 --> 00:58:58,617
and on top of everything else
I had a gigantic goddamn
hotel bill to deal with.

1085
00:59:01,054 --> 00:59:03,453
I didn't even know
who'd won the race.

1086
00:59:03,524 --> 00:59:05,457
- Maybe nobody.
- [Arguing]

1087
00:59:05,526 --> 00:59:08,460
How would Horatio Alger
have handled this situation?

1088
00:59:09,631 --> 00:59:12,929
Stay calm.
Stay calm.

1089
00:59:13,001 --> 00:59:15,332
I'm a relatively
respectable citizen.

1090
00:59:15,404 --> 00:59:18,429
- Multiple felon, perhaps,
but certainly not dangerous.
- [Whistles]

1091
00:59:18,507 --> 00:59:20,940
- [Engine Revs]
- Taxi!

1092
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:25,536
Luckily I had taken the soap
and grapefruit and other luggage
out to the car earlier.

1093
00:59:25,614 --> 00:59:27,137
Now...

1094
00:59:27,216 --> 00:59:29,149
it was only a matter
of slipping the noose.

1095
00:59:29,218 --> 00:59:33,017
Hey! Here, take this.
All right.

1096
00:59:33,088 --> 00:59:37,182
- Mr. Duke! Mr. Duke!
- Oh, shit.

1097
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:41,559
- We've been looking for you.
- The game was up. They had me.

1098
00:59:41,631 --> 00:59:44,929
Many fine books have been written
in prison, huh?

1099
00:59:45,001 --> 00:59:47,194
- Sir?
- What?

1100
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:49,361
Um, this telegram
came for you.

1101
00:59:49,439 --> 00:59:52,429
Actually, it's not for you.
It's for somebody named, uh, Thompson.

1102
00:59:52,509 --> 00:59:55,875
But it says, "Care of Raoul Duke."
Do you... Do you...

1103
00:59:55,946 --> 00:59:58,936
- Does that mean anything?
- Yes, yes, it means a lot. Thanks.

1104
00:59:59,016 --> 01:00:02,450
- Yeah, I checked the register
for this man Thompson.
- [Engine Revs]

1105
01:00:02,521 --> 01:00:05,079
We don't show him, but I figured
he might be part of your team.

1106
01:00:05,157 --> 01:00:07,180
- He is. Don't worry. I'll get it to him.
- Yeah.

1107
01:00:07,259 --> 01:00:09,886
Um, what confused us
was, uh...

1108
01:00:09,961 --> 01:00:14,396
Dr. Gonzo's signature
on the telegram from Los Angeles
when we knew he was right here.

1109
01:00:14,465 --> 01:00:16,591
Right.
You did the right thing.

1110
01:00:16,668 --> 01:00:19,999
Never try to understand a press message.
About half the time, we use codes.

1111
01:00:20,072 --> 01:00:22,368
Especially with Dr. Gonzo.
See ya.

1112
01:00:22,441 --> 01:00:26,308
- Um, tell me.
- [Tires Screech]

1113
01:00:26,378 --> 01:00:28,936
When will the doctor
be awake?

1114
01:00:29,015 --> 01:00:33,007
- Awake? What do you mean?
- Well, um...

1115
01:00:33,086 --> 01:00:36,748
my manager, Mr. Heem,
would like to meet him.

1116
01:00:36,823 --> 01:00:39,313
It's nothing unusual, um...

1117
01:00:39,392 --> 01:00:43,418
Mr. Heem likes to meet
all of our large accounts...

1118
01:00:43,497 --> 01:00:45,759
put 'em on a personal basis,
you know?

1119
01:00:45,832 --> 01:00:48,025
Just a chat and a handshake.
You understand.

1120
01:00:48,101 --> 01:00:50,034
Of course,
but if I were you...

1121
01:00:50,105 --> 01:00:52,504
I would leave the doctor alone
until after he's eaten his breakfast...

1122
01:00:52,573 --> 01:00:54,506
because he's
a very crude man.

1123
01:00:54,576 --> 01:00:57,043
Jesus God!

1124
01:00:57,112 --> 01:00:59,602
- No!
- [Tires Screech]

1125
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:04,446
But he will be available,
huh, maybe later this morning?

1126
01:01:04,519 --> 01:01:08,545
Look, the telegram
is actually all scrambled.

1127
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:11,590
It's actually from Thompson,
not to him.

1128
01:01:11,659 --> 01:01:15,321
All right? Now, I've got to go.
I've gotta get to the race.

1129
01:01:15,398 --> 01:01:18,126
- B-But there's no hurry.
The race is over.
- Not for me.

1130
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:21,361
Well, um...
Let's have lunch!

1131
01:01:21,437 --> 01:01:23,927
Righty-o, man.
Righty-o.

- # Now, the bricks

Bad waves of paranoia.
Madness. Fear and loathing.

1134
01:01:34,817 --> 01:01:37,716
Intolerable vibrations
in this place. Get out.

1135
01:01:37,788 --> 01:01:39,721
The weasels were closing in.

1136
01:01:39,791 --> 01:01:42,019
I could smell the ugly brutes.

1137
01:01:42,092 --> 01:01:44,025
Do me one last favor, Lord.

1138
01:01:44,094 --> 01:01:47,655
Just give me five more high-speed hours
before You bring the hammer down.

1139
01:01:47,732 --> 01:01:52,896
Just let me get rid of this goddamn car
and off this horrible desert.

gonna have me on Your hands.

- Pull over! Pull over!
- Hey!

1146
01:02:20,866 --> 01:02:22,389
Good morning. How are you?
All right, man. Doing very well.

1147
01:02:27,207 --> 01:02:29,264
Few people understand the psychology
of dealing with a highway traffic cop.

1148
01:02:29,341 --> 01:02:33,867
Your normal speeder will panic
and immediately pull over to the side.

1149
01:02:33,947 --> 01:02:36,937
This is wrong.
It arouses contempt in the cop heart.

1150
01:02:38,518 --> 01:02:41,781
Make the bastard chase you.
He will follow.

1151
01:02:41,856 --> 01:02:45,586
But he won't know what to make
of your blinker signal that says
you're about to turn right.

1152
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:50,426
This is to let him know you're
pulling off for a proper place to talk.

1153
01:02:50,499 --> 01:02:52,865
It'll take him a moment
to realize he's about to make
a 180-degree turn, at speed.

1154
01:02:52,865 --> 01:02:55,231
It'll take him a moment
to realize he's about to make
a 180-degree turn, at speed.

1155
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:57,493
But you will be ready.
Brace for the "G"s.

1156
01:02:57,569 --> 01:02:59,660
Fast heel-toe work.

01:03:12,252 --> 01:03:15,118
Hi. How are you?

1160
01:03:17,357 --> 01:03:20,256
Just what in the hell
did you think you were doing?

1161
01:03:20,326 --> 01:03:23,725
I wanna know.
Let me see your license.

1162
01:03:23,796 --> 01:03:26,855
Oh, yeah, of course.
There you are.

01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:31,903
Oh, my gosh.

It's me.

May I please have that?

1166
01:03:42,216 --> 01:03:44,944
I knew I was fucked.

1167
01:03:50,959 --> 01:03:54,415
See you have two cases of beer,
a basket of grapefruit...

1168
01:03:54,496 --> 01:03:56,862
stack of T-shirts and towels,
light bulbs.

1169
01:03:58,768 --> 01:04:02,329
- You realize what you did
when you drive like that?
- Yeah, I know. I'm guilty.

1170
01:04:02,405 --> 01:04:05,931
I understand that. I knew it
was a crime. I did it anyway.

1171
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:08,975
Shit, why argue?
I'm a fucking criminal. Look at me.

1172
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:11,569
You have
a strange attitude.

1173
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:13,670
Maybe.

1174
01:04:13,749 --> 01:04:18,242
You know, I have a feeling
you need to take a nap.

1175
01:04:18,322 --> 01:04:20,618
There's a rest area
just up ahead.

1176
01:04:20,691 --> 01:04:23,920
I'd like you to go up there,
pull over and get a few hours' sleep.

1177
01:04:23,993 --> 01:04:26,016
That's not gonna help me.

1178
01:04:26,096 --> 01:04:29,292
I've been awake for too long.
Three or four nights, maybe.
Can't even remember.

1179
01:04:29,367 --> 01:04:32,095
I go to sleep now,
I'm dead for 20 hours.

1180

What are you carrying
two cases of soap for, son?

1181
01:04:36,573 --> 01:04:39,006
I wanna stay clean.

I advised you to proceed
to the next rest area...

01:05:01,901 --> 01:05:04,926

1190
01:05:06,505 --> 01:05:09,098
And take a long nap.

01:05:10,309 --> 01:05:12,742
Do I make myself clear?

1192

Well...
how far is Baker?

1193

I don't know, stop there for lunch.

beyond the rest area.

Can you make it that far?

1197
01:05:28,396 --> 01:05:30,555
I'll try.

1198
01:05:30,631 --> 01:05:34,895
I've been wanting to go to Baker for
a long time. Yeah. Heard a lot about it.

1199
01:05:36,737 --> 01:05:38,670
Excellent seafood.

You know, I'm thinkin',
a guy with your kind of mind...

1201
01:05:43,811 --> 01:05:46,677
ought to try
the land-crab.

1202
01:05:46,748 --> 01:05:50,147
- Excellent seafood.
- Land-crab.

1203
01:05:50,219 --> 01:05:53,550
All right. Why not?

1205
01:05:55,991 --> 01:05:58,082
Look at me in the eyes.

1206
01:06:01,396 --> 01:06:03,329
Everything all right?

1207
01:06:06,636 --> 01:06:10,366
May I have a little kiss
before you go?

1208
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:13,942
I'm very lonely here.

1209
01:06:14,210 --> 01:06:17,473
# Oh, Mama #

1210
01:06:17,546 --> 01:06:20,343
# Can this really
be the end #

1211
01:06:20,417 --> 01:06:24,284
I felt raped.
The pig had done me on all fronts.

1212
01:06:24,354 --> 01:06:27,550
And now he was going off to chuckle
about it on the west side of town...

1213
01:06:27,624 --> 01:06:30,091
waiting for me
to make a run for L.A.

1214
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:34,357
Why, yes, Officer. Of course
I'll take advantage of that rest area.

1215
01:06:34,432 --> 01:06:39,060
And I can't tell you how grateful
I am for this break you wanna give me.

1216
01:06:39,136 --> 01:06:42,070
Get a grip, man.

1217
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:45,701
If I boom straight for L.A.,
he'll bust me for sure.

1218
01:06:45,777 --> 01:06:49,371
No. This was not the time
for a showdown.

1219
01:06:51,616 --> 01:06:53,707
This was Death Valley.

Well, they've nailed me,
goddamn it.

1230
01:07:20,681 --> 01:07:23,114
I'm trapped in some stinking
desert crossroads called Baker.

1231
01:07:23,182 --> 01:07:25,945
I don't have much time, man.
The fuckers are closing in.

1232
01:07:26,021 --> 01:07:29,217
- They'll hunt me down
like a fucking beast.
- [Gonzo] You sound paranoid.

1233
01:07:29,289 --> 01:07:31,380
I need a fucking lawyer
immediately!

1234
01:07:31,458 --> 01:07:34,221
[Gonzo] What are you doing in Baker?
Didn't you get my telegram?

1235
01:07:34,295 --> 01:07:38,788
What telegram, you worthless bastard?
I'll cripple your ass for this.

1236
01:07:38,868 --> 01:07:42,064
You brainless scumbag,
you're supposed to be in Vegas.

1237
01:07:42,137 --> 01:07:44,296
I rented a suite
at the Flamingo.

1238
01:07:44,372 --> 01:07:48,740
You're supposed to be covering the
National District Attorney's conference.

1239
01:07:48,810 --> 01:07:52,972
- I made all the reservations.
Everything is arranged.
- [Bird Cawing]

1240
01:07:53,049 --> 01:07:56,483
Now, what the fuck are you doing out
there in the middle of the desert?

1241
01:07:56,552 --> 01:07:59,815
Nothing. Never mind.
It's all a big joke.

1242
01:07:59,889 --> 01:08:03,381
I'm actually, uh... I'm poolside
at the Flamingo right now...

1243
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:06,394
talking through a portable phone some
dwarf brought out from the casino.

1244
01:08:06,462 --> 01:08:09,725
Yeah, I have total credit here.
Don't come anywhere
near this place, you bastard.

1245
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:11,733
Foreigners
aren't welcome here.

1246
01:08:14,071 --> 01:08:17,767
Well, this is how
the world works.

1247
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:22,172
All energy flows according
to the whims of the Great Magnet.

1248
01:08:22,245 --> 01:08:24,940
What a fool I was
to defy him.

1249
01:08:25,015 --> 01:08:28,211
I was going back to Vegas.
I had no choice.

1250
01:08:31,456 --> 01:08:33,547
I had to get rid
of the Shark.

1251
01:08:33,625 --> 01:08:37,889
Too many people might recognize it,
especially the Vegas police.

1252
01:08:39,230 --> 01:08:43,029
Luckily, my credit card
was still technically valid.

1253
01:08:43,101 --> 01:08:46,330
Now this
was a superior machine.

1254
01:08:46,405 --> 01:08:50,340
Ten grand worth of gimmicks
and high-priced special effects.

1255
01:08:50,409 --> 01:08:53,843
The rear windows leapt up with a touch
like frogs in a dynamite pond.

1256
01:08:53,911 --> 01:08:57,345
The dashboard was full of esoteric
lights and dials and meters...

1257
01:08:57,416 --> 01:08:59,815
that I would never understand.

1258
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:02,547
If the pigs
were gathering in Vegas...

1259
01:09:02,622 --> 01:09:06,216
I felt the drug culture
should be represented as well.

1260
01:09:06,292 --> 01:09:09,259
And there was a certain bent appeal in
the notion of running a savage burn...

1261
01:09:09,330 --> 01:09:11,263
on one Las Vegas hotel...

1262
01:09:11,331 --> 01:09:14,594
and then just wheeling across town
and checking into another.

1263
01:09:14,667 --> 01:09:17,930
Me and a thousand ranking cops
from all over America.

1264
01:09:18,004 --> 01:09:21,096
Why not move confidently
into their midst?

1265
01:09:21,175 --> 01:09:24,701
- Welcome to the Flamingo Hotel, sir.

01:09:27,248 --> 01:09:29,181

down there at Kent State.

I'm a police chief
from Michigan.

Look, fella, I have
explained to you.

1282
01:10:17,734 --> 01:10:22,999
I have this postcard which says that
I have a reservation in this hotel.

1283
01:10:23,073 --> 01:10:26,838
I'm very sorry, sir,
but you're on the late list.

1284
01:10:26,912 --> 01:10:31,280
- So your reservation
has been transferred to...
- It's okay.

1285
01:10:31,348 --> 01:10:35,113
The... Moonlight Motel...

1286
01:10:35,187 --> 01:10:37,711
which is just out
on Paradise Boulevard.

1287
01:10:37,790 --> 01:10:40,882
We've already paid
for our goddamn room!

1288
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:44,052
It's actually a very fine
place of lodging, and it's
only 16 blocks from here.

1289
01:10:44,128 --> 01:10:46,151
It has a pool,
sauna, steam.

You listen to me,
you filthy little faggot!

1291

I want a manager down here,
now, now!

1295
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:02,606
Sure, and I'll call you
a cocksucker!

[Duke Narrating]
Of course, I could hear what

if I could slide on through.

that white Cadillac convertible there.

Maybe somebody could
bring it to the room for me.

- You just calm down!

- Montana.

Montana. Just to give
these portraits to Barbra.

I hadn't counted on this:

1353
01:14:10,247 --> 01:14:14,239
Finding my attorney on acid
and locked into some kind
of preternatural courtship.

Well...

brought the car around by now.

- Oh, Lucy.

I met her on the plane.

1375
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,662
Yeah.
She's a religious freak.

1376

I gave her a cap
before I realized...

even had a drink.

Well, it'll probably work out.

We can keep her loaded, and then
peddle her ass at the drug convention.

Yeah, she's perfect
for this gig.

to beat her into submission
and then gang-fuck her.

of these backstreet motels...

all over the room, and then turn

about four at a time.

be sane enough to work herself...

rage at the hazy recollection...

of being seduced by
some kind of cruel Samoan...

dragged her to a Vegas hotel room...

There's something wrong
with the motor.

# [Continues]

1839
01:41:37,553 --> 01:41:41,488
The mentality of Las Vegas
is so grossly atavistic...

1840
01:41:41,557 --> 01:41:45,219
that a really massive crime
often slips by unrecognized.

1841

North Vegas is where you go when you've

No hassles, no talk.

Just a place to rest

I wasn't even hungry.

The only chance now,

was the possibility that

01:51:36,387 --> 01:51:39,377
U.S. Interstate 15.

1956
01:51:39,456 --> 01:51:43,391
Just a flat out high-speed burn
through Baker and Barstow and Berdoo.

1957
01:51:43,461 --> 01:51:46,054
Then onto the Hollywood Freeway,
straight into frantic oblivion...

1958
01:51:46,130 --> 01:51:48,426
safety, obscurity.

1959
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:51,661
Just another freak...
in the freak kingdom.
