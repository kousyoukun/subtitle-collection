when the Stingray in front of us
killed a pedestrian.

with the car rental agency.

Hancock, you're on your way.

up materials and packing the car.

Then we ate some mescaline
and went swimming.

Our trip was different.

180
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,026

What limes?

756
00:40:46,814 --> 00:40:50,010

They don't grow in the desert.

[Duke Narrating] One of
the things you learn after years
of dealing with drug people...

832
00:44:36,143 --> 00:44:39,077
is that you can
turn your back on a person...

833
00:44:39,148 --> 00:44:42,081
but never turn your back
on a drug...

834
00:44:42,151 --> 00:44:45,278
especially when it's waving
a razor-sharp hunting knife in your eye.

What was the meaning
of this trip?

840
00:44:58,666 --> 00:45:02,101
Was I just roaming around
in a drug frenzy of some kind...

841
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:06,104
or had I really come out here
to Las Vegas to work on a story?

00:57:47,788 --> 00:57:49,721
There we go.

1060
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:51,723
Say nothing
to no one, man.

1061
00:57:51,791 --> 00:57:54,952
# Open up the window
Let some air into this room #

1062
00:57:55,029 --> 00:57:59,465
[Duke Narrating] The decision
to flee came suddenly. Or maybe not.

1063
00:57:59,533 --> 00:58:03,594
- # That cigarette you're smokin'
'bout scared me half to death #
- Maybe I'd planned it all along,

1064
00:58:03,672 --> 00:58:06,037
subconsciously waiting
for the right moment.

1065
00:58:06,108 --> 00:58:08,975
- # Mama told me not to come #
- The bill was a factor, I think...

1066
00:58:09,045 --> 00:58:11,842
- because I had no money to pay for it.
- # Mama told me not to come #

1067
00:58:11,915 --> 00:58:15,849
Our room service tabs had been
running somewhere between
29 and 36 dollars per hour...

1068
00:58:15,918 --> 00:58:18,853
- # That ain't the way
to have fun, son #
- for 48 consecutive hours.

1069
00:58:18,923 --> 00:58:20,855
- Incredible.
- # That ain't the way to have fun #

1070
00:58:20,924 --> 00:58:22,856
How could it happen?

1071
00:58:22,926 --> 00:58:27,294
But by the time I asked this question,
there was no one around to answer it.

1072
00:58:27,365 --> 00:58:30,491
That rotten attorney of mine,
Dr. Gonzo, was gone.

1073
00:58:30,569 --> 00:58:32,502
He must have sensed trouble.

1074
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:34,401
Hmm? Ohh.

1075
00:58:34,473 --> 00:58:36,304
A "Z"?

1076
00:58:36,375 --> 00:58:38,432
Panic.

1077
00:58:38,745 --> 00:58:43,339
It crept up my spine like
first-rising vibes of an acid frenzy.

1078
00:58:43,416 --> 00:58:47,352
- [Bell Dings]
- All these horrible realities
began to dawn on me.

1079
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:50,148
[Duke]
Oh, fuck.

1080
00:58:50,224 --> 00:58:52,157
Here I was...

1081
00:58:52,226 --> 00:58:55,285
alone in Las Vegas,
completely twisted on drugs.

1082
00:58:55,362 --> 00:58:58,660
No cash,
no story for the magazine...

1083
00:58:58,735 --> 00:59:04,171
and on top of everything else
I had a gigantic goddamn
hotel bill to deal with.

1084
00:59:06,608 --> 00:59:09,007
I didn't even know
who'd won the race.

1085
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:11,010
- Maybe nobody.
- [Arguing]

1086
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:14,015
How would Horatio Alger
have handled this situation?

1087
00:59:15,186 --> 00:59:18,484
Stay calm.
Stay calm.

1088
00:59:18,556 --> 00:59:20,887
I'm a relatively
respectable citizen.

1089
00:59:20,958 --> 00:59:23,984
- Multiple felon, perhaps,
but certainly not dangerous.
- [Whistles]

1090
00:59:24,062 --> 00:59:26,495
- [Engine Revs]
- Taxi!

1091
00:59:26,565 --> 00:59:31,092
Luckily I had taken the soap
and grapefruit and other luggage
out to the car earlier.

1092
00:59:31,169 --> 00:59:32,692
Now...

1093
00:59:32,772 --> 00:59:34,704
it was only a matter
of slipping the noose.

1094
00:59:34,774 --> 00:59:38,572
Hey! Here, take this.
All right.

1095
00:59:38,643 --> 00:59:42,738
- Mr. Duke! Mr. Duke!
- Oh, shit.

1096
00:59:42,816 --> 00:59:47,115
- We've been looking for you.
- The game was up. They had me.

1097
00:59:47,187 --> 00:59:50,485
Many fine books have been written
in prison, huh?

1098
00:59:50,557 --> 00:59:52,751
- Sir?
- What?

1099
00:59:52,827 --> 00:59:54,918
Um, this telegram
came for you.

1100
00:59:54,995 --> 00:59:57,986
Actually, it's not for you.
It's for somebody named, uh, Thompson.

1101
00:59:58,065 --> 01:00:01,432
But it says, "Care of Raoul Duke."
Do you... Do you...

1102
01:00:01,503 --> 01:00:04,493
- Does that mean anything?
- Yes, yes, it means a lot. Thanks.

1103
01:00:04,573 --> 01:00:08,007
- Yeah, I checked the register
for this man Thompson.
- [Engine Revs]

1104
01:00:08,078 --> 01:00:10,637
We don't show him, but I figured
he might be part of your team.

1105
01:00:10,715 --> 01:00:12,737
- He is. Don't worry. I'll get it to him.
- Yeah.

1106
01:00:12,816 --> 01:00:15,444
Um, what confused us
was, uh...

1107
01:00:15,519 --> 01:00:19,954
Dr. Gonzo's signature
on the telegram from Los Angeles
when we knew he was right here.

1108
01:00:20,024 --> 01:00:22,149
Right.
You did the right thing.

1109
01:00:22,225 --> 01:00:25,557
Never try to understand a press message.
About half the time, we use codes.

1110
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:27,927
Especially with Dr. Gonzo.
See ya.

1111
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:31,866
- Um, tell me.
- [Tires Screech]

1112
01:00:31,936 --> 01:00:34,495
When will the doctor
be awake?

1113
01:00:34,573 --> 01:00:38,566
- Awake? What do you mean?
- Well, um...

1114
01:00:38,644 --> 01:00:42,307
my manager, Mr. Heem,
would like to meet him.

1115
01:00:42,382 --> 01:00:44,872
It's nothing unusual, um...

1116
01:00:44,951 --> 01:00:48,977
Mr. Heem likes to meet
all of our large accounts...

1117
01:00:49,057 --> 01:00:51,318
put 'em on a personal basis,
you know?

1118
01:00:51,391 --> 01:00:53,584
Just a chat and a handshake.
You understand.

1119
01:00:53,661 --> 01:00:55,594
Of course,
but if I were you...

1120
01:00:55,665 --> 01:00:58,064
I would leave the doctor alone
until after he's eaten his breakfast...

1121
01:00:58,132 --> 01:01:00,066
because he's
a very crude man.

1122
01:01:00,136 --> 01:01:02,603
Jesus God!

1123
01:01:02,672 --> 01:01:05,162
- No!
- [Tires Screech]

1124
01:01:05,241 --> 01:01:10,006
But he will be available,
huh, maybe later this morning?

1125
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:14,105
Look, the telegram
is actually all scrambled.

1126
01:01:14,183 --> 01:01:17,151
It's actually from Thompson,
not to him.

1127
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:20,882
All right? Now, I've got to go.
I've gotta get to the race.

1128
01:01:20,959 --> 01:01:23,687
- B-But there's no hurry.
The race is over.
- Not for me.

1129
01:01:23,761 --> 01:01:26,922
Well, um...
Let's have lunch!

1130
01:01:26,998 --> 01:01:29,488
Righty-o, man.
Righty-o.

1131

- # Now, the bricks
lay on Grand Street #
- Jesus.

1132

Bad waves of paranoia.
Madness. Fear and loathing.

1133
01:01:40,379 --> 01:01:43,278
Intolerable vibrations
in this place. Get out.

1134
01:01:43,350 --> 01:01:45,283
The weasels were closing in.

1135
01:01:45,354 --> 01:01:47,582
I could smell the ugly brutes.

1136
01:01:47,655 --> 01:01:49,589
Do me one last favor, Lord.

1137
01:01:49,656 --> 01:01:53,218
Just give me five more high-speed hours
before You bring the hammer down.

1138
01:01:53,294 --> 01:01:58,459
Just let me get rid of this goddamn car
and off this horrible desert.

gonna have me on Your hands.

01:02:23,762 --> 01:02:26,356
- Pull over! Pull over!
- Hey!

1145
01:02:26,431 --> 01:02:27,954
Good morning. How are you?
All right, man. Doing very well.

1146
01:02:32,773 --> 01:02:34,829
Few people understand the psychology
of dealing with a highway traffic cop.

1147
01:02:34,907 --> 01:02:39,432
Your normal speeder will panic
and immediately pull over to the side.

1148
01:02:39,513 --> 01:02:42,503
This is wrong.
It arouses contempt in the cop heart.

1149
01:02:44,084 --> 01:02:47,347
Make the bastard chase you.
He will follow.

1150
01:02:47,422 --> 01:02:51,152
But he won't know what to make
of your blinker signal that says
you're about to turn right.

1151
01:02:51,226 --> 01:02:55,992
This is to let him know you're
pulling off for a proper place to talk.

1152
01:02:56,065 --> 01:02:58,431
It'll take him a moment
to realize he's about to make
a 180-degree turn, at speed.

1153
01:02:58,431 --> 01:03:00,798
It'll take him a moment
to realize he's about to make
a 180-degree turn, at speed.

1154
01:03:00,867 --> 01:03:03,060
But you will be ready.
Brace for the "G"s.

1155
01:03:03,135 --> 01:03:05,227
Fast heel-toe work.

1158
01:03:17,819 --> 01:03:20,685
Hi. How are you?

1159
01:03:22,925 --> 01:03:25,824
Just what in the hell
did you think you were doing?

1160
01:03:25,894 --> 01:03:29,293
I wanna know.
Let me see your license.

1161
01:03:29,364 --> 01:03:32,423
Oh, yeah, of course.
There you are.

01:03:35,538 --> 01:03:37,472
Oh, my gosh.

1163
01:03:41,946 --> 01:03:44,277
It's me.

1164
01:03:44,347 --> 01:03:46,279
May I please have that?

1165
01:03:47,786 --> 01:03:50,513
I knew I was fucked.

1166
01:03:56,528 --> 01:03:59,985
See you have two cases of beer,
a basket of grapefruit...

1167
01:04:00,065 --> 01:04:02,433
stack of T-shirts and towels,
light bulbs.

1168
01:04:04,338 --> 01:04:07,899
- You realize what you did
when you drive like that?
- Yeah, I know. I'm guilty.

1169
01:04:07,975 --> 01:04:11,502
I understand that. I knew it
was a crime. I did it anyway.

1170
01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:14,546
Shit, why argue?
I'm a fucking criminal. Look at me.

1171
01:04:14,615 --> 01:04:17,139
You have
a strange attitude.

1172
01:04:17,218 --> 01:04:19,241
Maybe.

1173
01:04:19,319 --> 01:04:23,813
You know, I have a feeling
you need to take a nap.

1174
01:04:23,892 --> 01:04:26,189
There's a rest area
just up ahead.

1175
01:04:26,263 --> 01:04:29,491
I'd like you to go up there,
pull over and get a few hours' sleep.

1176
01:04:29,565 --> 01:04:31,588
That's not gonna help me.

1177
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:34,863
I've been awake for too long.
Three or four nights, maybe.
Can't even remember.

1178
01:04:34,939 --> 01:04:37,667
I go to sleep now,
I'm dead for 20 hours.

1179
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:42,074
What are you carrying
two cases of soap for, son?

1180
01:04:42,145 --> 01:04:44,579
I wanna stay clean.

01:04:44,648 --> 01:04:46,582
No.

What I put in my book,

is that I apprehended you
for driving too fast.

I advised you to proceed
to the next rest area...

1188
01:05:07,474 --> 01:05:10,500
your stated destination, right?

1189
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:14,672
And take a long nap.

1190
01:05:15,882 --> 01:05:18,316
Do I make myself clear?

1191
01:05:18,386 --> 01:05:21,376
Well...
how far is Baker?

1192
01:05:21,456 --> 01:05:24,856
I was sort of hoping to,
I don't know, stop there for lunch.

It's not my jurisdiction.

beyond the rest area.

1195
01:05:31,933 --> 01:05:33,900
Can you make it that far?

1196
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:36,130
I'll try.

1197
01:05:36,207 --> 01:05:40,470
I've been wanting to go to Baker for
a long time. Yeah. Heard a lot about it.

1198
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:44,245
Excellent seafood.

You know, I'm thinkin',
a guy with your kind of mind...

1200
01:05:49,387 --> 01:05:52,253
ought to try
the land-crab.

1201
01:05:52,324 --> 01:05:55,723
- Excellent seafood.
- Land-crab.

1202
01:05:55,795 --> 01:05:59,126
All right. Why not?

1203

01:06:06,973 --> 01:06:08,905
Everything all right?

1206
01:06:12,212 --> 01:06:15,943
May I have a little kiss
before you go?

1207
01:06:16,017 --> 01:06:19,520
I'm very lonely here.

1208
01:06:19,787 --> 01:06:23,051
# Oh, Mama #

1209
01:06:23,123 --> 01:06:25,920
# Can this really
be the end #

1210
01:06:25,995 --> 01:06:29,862
I felt raped.
The pig had done me on all fronts.

1211
01:06:29,931 --> 01:06:33,129
And now he was going off to chuckle
about it on the west side of town...

1212
01:06:33,201 --> 01:06:35,669
waiting for me
to make a run for L.A.

1213
01:06:35,738 --> 01:06:39,935
Why, yes, Officer. Of course
I'll take advantage of that rest area.

1214
01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:44,638
And I can't tell you how grateful
I am for this break you wanna give me.

1215
01:06:44,714 --> 01:06:47,649
Get a grip, man.

1216
01:06:47,718 --> 01:06:51,279
If I boom straight for L.A.,
he'll bust me for sure.

1217
01:06:51,356 --> 01:06:54,950
No. This was not the time
for a showdown.

1218
01:06:57,196 --> 01:06:59,285
This was Death Valley.

1219

[Loud Grunt]

01:07:01,833 --> 01:07:04,266
Oh, fuck!

Sweet Jesus, it's him.

Come on, you fucking bastard.

1226
01:07:18,052 --> 01:07:21,282
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
I've got to go. I've got to...

# [Humming Resumes]

1228
01:07:23,925 --> 01:07:26,188
Well, they've nailed me,
goddamn it.

1229
01:07:26,262 --> 01:07:28,695
I'm trapped in some stinking
desert crossroads called Baker.

1230
01:07:28,763 --> 01:07:31,525
I don't have much time, man.
The fuckers are closing in.

1231
01:07:31,602 --> 01:07:34,798
- They'll hunt me down
like a fucking beast.
- [Gonzo] You sound paranoid.

1232
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:36,961
I need a fucking lawyer
immediately!

1233
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:39,802
[Gonzo] What are you doing in Baker?
Didn't you get my telegram?

1234
01:07:39,876 --> 01:07:44,370
What telegram, you worthless bastard?
I'll cripple your ass for this.

1235
01:07:44,449 --> 01:07:47,647
You brainless scumbag,
you're supposed to be in Vegas.

1236
01:07:47,718 --> 01:07:49,878
I rented a suite
at the Flamingo.

1237
01:07:49,954 --> 01:07:54,321
You're supposed to be covering the
National District Attorney's conference.

1238
01:07:54,392 --> 01:07:58,554
- I made all the reservations.
Everything is arranged.
- [Bird Cawing]

1239
01:07:58,632 --> 01:08:02,066
Now, what the fuck are you doing out
there in the middle of the desert?

1240
01:08:02,135 --> 01:08:05,398
Nothing. Never mind.
It's all a big joke.

1241
01:08:05,472 --> 01:08:08,963
I'm actually, uh... I'm poolside
at the Flamingo right now...

1242
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:11,977
talking through a portable phone some
dwarf brought out from the casino.

1243
01:08:12,044 --> 01:08:15,308
Yeah, I have total credit here.
Don't come anywhere
near this place, you bastard.

1244
01:08:15,383 --> 01:08:17,316
Foreigners
aren't welcome here.

1245
01:08:19,654 --> 01:08:23,350
Well, this is how
the world works.

1246
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:27,756
All energy flows according
to the whims of the Great Magnet.

1247
01:08:27,829 --> 01:08:30,524
What a fool I was
to defy him.

1248
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:33,795
I was going back to Vegas.
I had no choice.

1249
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,132
I had to get rid
of the Shark.

1250
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:43,474
Too many people might recognize it,
especially the Vegas police.

1251
01:08:44,815 --> 01:08:48,614
Luckily, my credit card
was still technically valid.

1252
01:08:48,687 --> 01:08:51,915
Now this
was a superior machine.

1253
01:08:51,991 --> 01:08:55,925
Ten grand worth of gimmicks
and high-priced special effects.

1254
01:08:55,994 --> 01:08:59,428
The rear windows leapt up with a touch
like frogs in a dynamite pond.

1255
01:08:59,497 --> 01:09:02,931
The dashboard was full of esoteric
lights and dials and meters...

1256
01:09:03,002 --> 01:09:05,401
that I would never understand.

1257
01:09:05,472 --> 01:09:08,133
If the pigs
were gathering in Vegas...

1258
01:09:08,208 --> 01:09:11,803
I felt the drug culture
should be represented as well.

1259
01:09:11,879 --> 01:09:14,846
And there was a certain bent appeal in
the notion of running a savage burn...

1260
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:16,850
on one Las Vegas hotel...

1261
01:09:16,917 --> 01:09:20,180
and then just wheeling across town
and checking into another.

1262
01:09:20,254 --> 01:09:23,516
Me and a thousand ranking cops
from all over America.

1263
01:09:23,591 --> 01:09:26,682
Why not move confidently
into their midst?

1264
01:09:26,762 --> 01:09:30,288
- Welcome to the Flamingo Hotel, sir.
- [Whimpers]

01:09:30,365 --> 01:09:32,765
- [Grunts, Clears Throat]
- Sir?

1266
01:09:32,836 --> 01:09:34,768
Yeah, hi. Right. Okay.

[Man] This here model
is one that we had to use...

1277
01:10:10,144 --> 01:10:13,635
when we took on them little peckerheads
down there at Kent State.

This baby here...

01:10:18,085 --> 01:10:21,075
I'm a police chief
from Michigan.

1280
01:10:21,157 --> 01:10:23,246
Look, fella, I have
explained to you.

1281
01:10:23,324 --> 01:10:28,589
I have this postcard which says that
I have a reservation in this hotel.

1282
01:10:28,664 --> 01:10:32,429
I'm very sorry, sir,
but you're on the late list.

1283
01:10:32,503 --> 01:10:36,870
- So your reservation
has been transferred to...
- It's okay.

1284
01:10:36,939 --> 01:10:40,704
The... Moonlight Motel...

1285
01:10:40,779 --> 01:10:43,302
which is just out
on Paradise Boulevard.

1286
01:10:43,381 --> 01:10:46,473
We've already paid
for our goddamn room!

1287
01:10:46,551 --> 01:10:49,643
It's actually a very fine
place of lodging, and it's
only 16 blocks from here.

1288
01:10:49,719 --> 01:10:51,743
It has a pool,
sauna, steam.

1289
01:10:51,824 --> 01:10:54,222
You listen to me,
you filthy little faggot!

1290
01:10:54,293 --> 01:10:56,692
I want a manager down here,
now, now!

1291
01:10:56,763 --> 01:10:59,855

- Can I call you a cab?

1294
01:11:06,072 --> 01:11:08,198
Sure, and I'll call you
a cocksucker!

1295
01:11:08,274 --> 01:11:11,106
[Duke Narrating]
Of course, I could hear what
the clerk was really saying.

1296
01:11:11,178 --> 01:11:14,237
Listen, you fuzzy
little shithead!

So fuck you, Officer.
I'm in charge.

Hey, listen, I really hate
to interrupt, but I wonder
if I could slide on through.

1303
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:39,735
The name is Raoul Duke. I think
my attorney made the reservations.

My bags... My bags are out there in
that white Cadillac convertible there.

1307
01:11:48,453 --> 01:11:50,318
Maybe somebody could
bring it to the room for me.

1308
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:54,790

- You just calm down!

01:11:59,799 --> 01:12:01,958
Shit, let's try some lime chunks.
What do you think?

01:12:02,034 --> 01:12:04,501
I say okay.

No more of that, okay?
That's my client, Lucy.

That's Mr. Duke,

He's paying for this suite, Lucy.

He's on our side.

- What's the name of that town?
- Montana.

1347
01:13:58,964 --> 01:14:02,695
Montana. Just to give
these portraits to Barbra.

01:14:15,849 --> 01:14:19,841
Finding my attorney on acid
and locked into some kind
of preternatural courtship.

Well...

brought the car around by now.

- Oh, Lucy.

I met her on the plane.

01:15:37,607 --> 01:15:41,269
Yeah.
She's a religious freak.

1375

I gave her a cap
before I realized...

even had a drink.

Well, it'll probably work out.

peddle her ass at the drug convention.

Yeah, she's perfect
for this gig.

to beat her into submission
and then gang-fuck her.

all over the room, and then turn

about four at a time.

be sane enough to work herself...

rage at the hazy recollection...

of being seduced by

dragged her to a Vegas hotel room...

without a tent.

- The top is completely jammed.
- You're right.

There's something wrong
with the motor.

# [Continues]

1838
01:41:43,243 --> 01:41:47,179
The mentality of Las Vegas
is so grossly atavistic...

1839
01:41:47,248 --> 01:41:50,909
that a really massive crime
often slips by unrecognized.

1840

North Vegas is where you go when you've

a fairly safe haven from our storms.

No hassles, no talk.

1844
01:42:15,413 --> 01:42:18,006
Just a place to rest
and regroup.

1845

I wasn't even hungry.

1846
01:42:20,685 --> 01:42:23,881
There was nothing in the atmosphere of

but I knew that our peace
was about to be shattered.

What was that?

What is this?

We'd abused every rule

Threatening the locals, abusing

The only chance now,
I felt...

was the possibility that
we'd gone to such excess...

old-mystic fallacy of the acid culture:

01:51:49,184 --> 01:51:51,777
Then onto the Hollywood Freeway,
straight into frantic oblivion...

1957
01:51:51,853 --> 01:51:54,149
safety, obscurity.

1958
01:51:54,223 --> 01:51:57,384
Just another freak...
in the freak kingdom.
