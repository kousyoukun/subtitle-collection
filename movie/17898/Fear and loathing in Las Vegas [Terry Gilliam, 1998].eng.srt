1
00:00:42,504 --> 00:00:45,665
<i>Raindrops on roses</i>

2
00:00:45,742 --> 00:00:48,941
<i>And whiskers on kittens</i>

3
00:00:49,331 --> 00:00:51,828
<i>Bright copper kettles</i>

4
00:00:51,906 --> 00:00:55,221
<i>And warm woolen mittens</i>

5
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,796
<i>Brown paper packages</i>

6
00:00:57,874 --> 00:01:00,410
<i>Tied up with strings</i>

7
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:03,296
<i>These are a few</i>

8
00:01:03,374 --> 00:01:08,211
<i>Of my favorite things</i>

9
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,140
<i>We were somewhere around Barstow,
on the edge of the desert,</i>

10
00:01:14,218 --> 00:01:15,857
<i>when the drugs began to take hold.</i>

11
00:01:29,276 --> 00:01:30,602
<i>I remember saying something like …</i>

12
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,123
I feel a bit lightheaded.

13
00:01:32,241 --> 00:01:34,113
Maybe you should drive.

14
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:39,964
<i>Suddenly there was a terrible roar all around us.</i>

15
00:01:40,042 --> 00:01:42,460
<i>And the sky was full of what looked like huge bats.</i>

16
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:45,464
<i>All swooping and screeching and diving around the car.</i>

17
00:01:45,542 --> 00:01:46,517
<i>And a voice was screaming …</i>

18
00:01:46,595 --> 00:01:48,467
Holy Jesus! What are
these goddamn animals?

19
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,003
<i>Come on, baby</i>

20
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:53,890
You say something?
Hmm?

21
00:01:54,553 --> 00:01:55,645
Never mind.

22
00:01:56,035 --> 00:01:57,362
It's your turn to drive.

23
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:00,365
<i>No point in mentioning these bats, I thought.</i>

24
00:02:00,443 --> 00:02:02,550
<i>The poor bastard'll see them soon enough.</i>

25
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,241
<i>Baby, I'm starting to feel human</i>

26
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,762
<i>Ohh, ohh, yeah</i>

27
00:02:06,841 --> 00:02:08,791
<i>Hey, hey, feel with me, baby</i>

28
00:02:08,907 --> 00:02:11,248
<i>'Cause I feel it coming on</i>

29
00:02:13,394 --> 00:02:15,890
Fucking pigs! Flying!

30
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:18,855
All right, let's see.

31
00:02:18,933 --> 00:02:22,600
<i>We had 2 bags of grass,
75 pellets of mescaline,</i>

32
00:02:22,677 --> 00:02:25,096
<i>5 sheets of
high-powered blotter acid,</i>

33
00:02:25,174 --> 00:02:27,281
<i>a salt shaker half full of cocaine,</i>

34
00:02:27,476 --> 00:02:31,221
<i>a whole galaxy of multicolored uppers,
downers, screamers, laughers.</i>

35
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:33,795
<i>Also, a quart of tequila, a quart of rum,</i>

36
00:02:33,873 --> 00:02:35,394
<i>a case of beer, a pint of raw ether …</i>

37
00:02:35,473 --> 00:02:36,409
Shit!

38
00:02:36,486 --> 00:02:38,047
<i>2 dozen amyls.</i>

39
00:02:38,398 --> 00:02:40,427
<i>Not that we needed all that for the trip,</i>

40
00:02:40,504 --> 00:02:42,962
<i>but once you get locked into a serious drug collection,</i>

41
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,419
<i>the tendency is to push it as far as you can.</i>

42
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:49,009
<i>The only thing that really worried me was the ether.</i>

43
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:50,802
<i>There is nothing in the world more helpless</i>

44
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:52,831
<i>and irresponsible and depraved</i>

45
00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:55,133
<i>than a man in the depths of an ether binge,</i>

46
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:58,019
<i>and I knew we'd get into that rotten stuff pretty soon.</i>

47
00:02:58,097 --> 00:02:59,891
<i>A House subcommittee report says,</i>

48
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,832
<i>illegal drugs killed 160 American GIs last year,</i>

49
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:05,938
<i>40 of them in Vietnam.</i>

50
00:03:06,015 --> 00:03:07,186
<i>Drugs …</i>

51
00:03:07,264 --> 00:03:08,434
<i>One toke over the line Sweet Jesus</i>

52
00:03:08,513 --> 00:03:09,916
One toke, man!

53
00:03:10,306 --> 00:03:12,960
<i>One toke over the line!</i>

54
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,314
<i>Sitting downtown at a railway station</i>

55
00:03:16,392 --> 00:03:18,928
<i>One toke over the line!</i>

56
00:03:19,005 --> 00:03:20,449
One toke, you poor fool?

57
00:03:20,527 --> 00:03:21,463
<i>Sweet, sweet Mary!</i>

58
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,803
Wait'll you see those goddamned bats, man.

59
00:03:24,428 --> 00:03:25,754
<i>Mine!</i>

60
00:03:26,846 --> 00:03:28,680
<i>One toke over the line</i>

61
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,034
Let's give that boy a lift.

62
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:33,517
What? No!

63
00:03:34,687 --> 00:03:36,520
Wait! We can't stop here.

64
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:38,158
This is bat country.

65
00:03:41,826 --> 00:03:44,868
Hot damn! I never rode
in a convertible before!

66
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,379
Is that right? Well, I guess you're
about ready then, aren't you?

67
00:03:48,457 --> 00:03:49,783
We're your friends.

68
00:03:49,861 --> 00:03:51,344
We're not like the others,
man. Really.

69
00:03:51,421 --> 00:03:53,957
No more of that talk or I'll put the
fucking leeches on you. Understand?

70
00:03:56,961 --> 00:03:58,092
Get in.

71
00:04:02,422 --> 00:04:04,411
<i>How long could we maintain, I wondered.</i>

72
00:04:04,996 --> 00:04:08,117
<i>How long before one of us starts
raving and jabbering at this boy?</i>

73
00:04:08,429 --> 00:04:09,911
<i>What will he think then?</i>

74
00:04:10,418 --> 00:04:13,421
<i>This same lonely desert was the last
known home of the Manson family.</i>

75
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:15,255
<i>Would he make that grim connection</i>

76
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,932
<i>when my attorney starts screaming about bats</i>

77
00:04:17,011 --> 00:04:19,039
<i>and huge manta rays coming down on the car?</i>

78
00:04:19,663 --> 00:04:23,525
<i>If so, well, we'll just have to cut
his head off and bury him somewhere.</i>

79
00:04:23,876 --> 00:04:26,684
<i>'Cause it goes without saying
that we can't turn him loose.</i>

80
00:04:27,153 --> 00:04:28,245
<i>He'd report us at once</i>

81
00:04:28,323 --> 00:04:30,312
<i>to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency</i>

82
00:04:30,391 --> 00:04:32,692
<i>and they'll run us down like dogs.</i>

83
00:04:33,121 --> 00:04:35,345
<i>Jesus, did I say that, or just think it?</i>

84
00:04:35,852 --> 00:04:38,621
<i>Was I talking?
Did they hear me?</i>

85
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:39,713
It's okay.

86
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,547
Just admiring the shape of your skull.

87
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:42,561
No, thanks!

88
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,941
<i>Maybe I'd better have a chat with this boy, I thought.
I have asthma!</i>

89
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,022
<i>Perhaps if I explain things, he'll rest easy.</i>

90
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,543
All right, listen.

91
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,845
There's one thing you should probably understand.

92
00:04:51,923 --> 00:04:53,210
Can you hear me?

93
00:04:53,366 --> 00:04:54,459
Good.

94
00:04:55,356 --> 00:04:57,462
I want you to have all the background.

95
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,374
This is a very ominous assignment

96
00:04:59,451 --> 00:05:01,480
with overtones of extreme personal danger.

97
00:05:01,753 --> 00:05:03,352
I'm a Doctor of Journalism, man.

98
00:05:03,431 --> 00:05:05,537
This is important, goddamn it!
This is a fucking true story!

99
00:05:05,615 --> 00:05:08,384
Shit! Hey, what're you doing?
Sit down. Get the fuck …

100
00:05:09,048 --> 00:05:11,232
Get your hands off my fucking head!

101
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,285
Now, now, now.

102
00:05:12,363 --> 00:05:14,860
<i>Our vibrations were getting nasty, but why?</i>

103
00:05:15,328 --> 00:05:17,083
<i>Was there no communication in this car?</i>

104
00:05:17,707 --> 00:05:20,009
<i>Had we deteriorated to the level of dumb beasts?</i>

105
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:22,583
I want you to understand that this
man at the wheel is my attorney.

106
00:05:22,662 --> 00:05:24,495
He's not just some dingbat I found on the Strip, man.

107
00:05:24,572 --> 00:05:25,899
He's a foreigner.

108
00:05:25,977 --> 00:05:27,459
I think he's probably Samoan.

109
00:05:27,576 --> 00:05:29,215
It doesn't matter, though, does it?

110
00:05:29,799 --> 00:05:30,736
Are you prejudiced?

111
00:05:30,814 --> 00:05:31,750
Hell, no.

112
00:05:31,828 --> 00:05:33,154
I didn't think so.

113
00:05:33,544 --> 00:05:36,704
Because in spite of his race,
this man is extremely valuable to me.

114
00:05:36,782 --> 00:05:38,967
Oh, shit. I forgot about the beer.
You want some?

115
00:05:39,045 --> 00:05:39,942
No.

116
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,112
How about some ether?

117
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:42,282
What?

118
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,871
Never mind.
All right, let's get right to the heart of this thing.

119
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,120
24 hours ago we were sitting …

120
00:05:47,197 --> 00:05:49,772
<i>… in the Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Heights Hotel.</i>

121
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,605
<i>In the patio section, of course.</i>

122
00:05:51,878 --> 00:05:55,077
<i>Drinking Singapore Slings with mescal on the side.</i>

123
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:59,173
<i>Hiding from the brutish realities
of this foul year of our Lord,</i>

124
00:05:59,251 --> 00:06:00,733
<i>1971.</i>

125
00:06:01,552 --> 00:06:02,801
Cops were going apeshit …

126
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:07,560
Perhaps this is the call you've been
waiting for all this time, sir.

127
00:06:08,691 --> 00:06:09,744
Perhaps.

128
00:06:10,018 --> 00:06:11,071
Yeah?

129
00:06:11,227 --> 00:06:12,163
Mmm-hmm.

130
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:15,127
Mmm. Really?
All right. Yeah?

131
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,780
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Oh, yeah. Okay. Bye.

132
00:06:18,326 --> 00:06:19,964
That was headquarters.
They want me to …

133
00:06:24,645 --> 00:06:25,737
Thank you.

134
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:29,951
They want me to go to Las Vegas at once.

135
00:06:30,028 --> 00:06:32,447
Make contact with a Portuguese photographer named Lacerda.

136
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,242
He'll have all the details.

137
00:06:34,476 --> 00:06:37,401
All I have to do is check into my soundproof suite.

138
00:06:37,674 --> 00:06:39,351
He'll seek me out.
What do you think?

139
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,106
Sounds like real trouble.

140
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,461
You're gonna need plenty of legal
advice before this thing is over.

141
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,514
Oh, yeah.

142
00:06:45,593 --> 00:06:46,684
As your attorney, I advise you

143
00:06:46,763 --> 00:06:48,285
to rent a very fast car with no top.

144
00:06:49,182 --> 00:06:51,288
And you'll need the cocaine.

145
00:06:51,365 --> 00:06:53,356
Tape recorder for special music.

146
00:06:54,057 --> 00:06:55,774
Acapulco shirts.

147
00:06:55,852 --> 00:06:58,738
Get the hell out of L.A.
for at least 48 hours.

148
00:06:59,323 --> 00:07:01,000
Blows my weekend.
Why?

149
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:03,848
'Cause, naturally, I'm gonna have to go with you.

150
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:07,945
And we're gonna have to arm ourselves to the teeth.

151
00:07:08,022 --> 00:07:10,168
Well, why not?

152
00:07:10,948 --> 00:07:14,303
I mean, if a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right.

153
00:07:14,888 --> 00:07:17,345
This is the American Dream in action.

154
00:07:18,281 --> 00:07:19,257
Wait!

155
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:25,225
Shit, we'd be fools not to ride this strange
torpedo all the way out to the end.

156
00:07:25,732 --> 00:07:27,995
Indeed. We must do it.

157
00:07:28,423 --> 00:07:29,711
What kind of story is this?

158
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:31,193
It's the Mint 400.

159
00:07:31,271 --> 00:07:33,494
The richest off-road race for motorcycles and dune buggies

160
00:07:33,573 --> 00:07:35,289
in the history of organized sport.

161
00:07:35,796 --> 00:07:38,683
It's a fantastic spectacle in
honor of some fatback grosero,

162
00:07:38,761 --> 00:07:41,492
who owns the luxurious Mint Hotel in downtown Las Vegas.

163
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:43,402
At least that's what the press release says, anyway.

164
00:07:43,481 --> 00:07:46,329
Well, as your attorney, I advise you to buy a motorcycle.

165
00:07:46,446 --> 00:07:48,746
How else can you cover a thing like this righteously?

166
00:07:48,825 --> 00:07:52,336
Well, we're gonna have to drum it up on our own.

167
00:07:52,647 --> 00:07:54,442
Pure Gonzo journalism.

168
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:57,797
Shit!

169
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:07,080
<i>Getting hold of the drugs and shirts had been no problem.</i>

170
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:09,461
<i>But the car and tape recorder
were not easy things to round up</i>

171
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:11,761
<i>at 6:30 on a Friday afternoon
in Hollywood.</i>

172
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,400
Sounds beautiful.

173
00:08:14,063 --> 00:08:15,585
Great. Hang on to it.

174
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,471
Fucking A, the gentleman has a major credit card!

175
00:08:18,549 --> 00:08:20,968
That's right, man.
Don't take any guff from these fucking swine.

176
00:08:21,046 --> 00:08:22,059
I just got through saying that.

177
00:08:22,138 --> 00:08:24,167
Do you realize who the fuck you're talking to?

178
00:08:24,634 --> 00:08:26,194
Right.
Do you?

179
00:08:27,403 --> 00:08:29,159
Be over in 30 minutes.

180
00:08:31,968 --> 00:08:33,294
<i>We're gonna need a sound store.</i>

181
00:08:33,372 --> 00:08:35,401
<i>We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.</i>

182
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:37,117
<i>Jesus Christ.
We will, man.</i>

183
00:08:37,507 --> 00:08:39,223
<i>You Samoans are all the same.</i>

184
00:08:39,301 --> 00:08:42,578
<i>You have no faith in the essential
decency of the white man's culture.</i>

185
00:08:43,827 --> 00:08:45,387
<i>The store was closed.</i>

186
00:08:45,464 --> 00:08:47,571
<i>But the salesman said he could wait if we hurry.</i>

187
00:08:49,054 --> 00:08:50,301
<i>But we were delayed en route</i>

188
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,330
<i>when a Stingray in front of us killed a pedestrian.</i>

189
00:08:54,592 --> 00:08:56,660
<i>We had trouble again with the car rental agency.</i>

190
00:08:56,738 --> 00:08:58,416
Hey, Mr. Duke,
we're all settled.

191
00:08:58,493 --> 00:09:00,756
If I could just get your John Hancock, you're on your way.

192
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:01,887
Yeah.

193
00:09:02,238 --> 00:09:04,344
Listen, you're gonna be real careful with this car, right?

194
00:09:04,423 --> 00:09:05,514
Oh, yeah, man. Of course.

195
00:09:05,593 --> 00:09:06,529
Good. Jeez …

196
00:09:07,075 --> 00:09:08,869
No, no, no!

197
00:09:13,356 --> 00:09:14,759
Holy smokes!

198
00:09:14,838 --> 00:09:16,983
You just backed over
a two-foot concrete abutment,

199
00:09:17,061 --> 00:09:18,231
you didn't even slow down.

200
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,962
What were you going about, I don't know,
45 miles an hour backwards?

201
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,561
Hey.
There's no harm done.

202
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:24,161
- Oh?
- I always test the transmission that way,

203
00:09:24,238 --> 00:09:25,253
the rear end for stress factors.

204
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:26,969
Boy, this is really a nice pen, man.

205
00:09:27,047 --> 00:09:28,529
Hey, listen, you …

206
00:09:28,608 --> 00:09:30,948
You fellows haven't been drinking, have you?

207
00:09:31,026 --> 00:09:32,782
No. Not me.
Oh.

208
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,030
We're responsible people.

209
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:35,239
Hey, hey, hey!

210
00:09:35,317 --> 00:09:37,463
Goddamn it, you've got my pen!

211
00:09:39,374 --> 00:09:41,168
Goddamn hippies!

212
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:44,874
<i>We spent the rest of that night</i>

213
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:46,552
<i>rounding up materials and packing the car.</i>

214
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:49,828
<i>Then we ate some mescaline and went swimming.</i>

215
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,236
<i>Our trip was different.</i>

216
00:09:54,314 --> 00:09:55,562
<i>It was to be a classic affirmation</i>

217
00:09:55,641 --> 00:09:57,903
<i>of everything right and true in the national character.</i>

218
00:09:57,981 --> 00:10:02,077
<i>A gross physical salute to the fantastic
possibilities of life in this country.</i>

219
00:10:02,155 --> 00:10:03,832
<i>But only for those with true grit.</i>

220
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,704
And we are chock full of that, man.

221
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:07,811
Damn right!

222
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:11,517
My attorney understands this concept,
despite his racial handicap.

223
00:10:12,063 --> 00:10:13,194
But do you?

224
00:10:14,325 --> 00:10:17,914
<i>He said he understood, but I could
see in his eyes that he didn't.</i>

225
00:10:18,226 --> 00:10:19,474
He was lying to me.

226
00:10:33,673 --> 00:10:34,648
Medicine!

227
00:10:34,726 --> 00:10:36,052
What?
Medicine!

228
00:10:36,131 --> 00:10:37,457
Medicine?
Oh, yeah, medicine. Right.

229
00:10:37,574 --> 00:10:38,549
Right here.

230
00:10:38,627 --> 00:10:41,124
Don't worry.
This man has a bad heart.

231
00:10:41,358 --> 00:10:42,801
Angina pectoris.

232
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:44,673
But we have a cure for it.
Here you go.

233
00:10:44,751 --> 00:10:46,117
All right.

234
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:49,159
Big whiff. Big whiff.
Big whiff, sonny boy.

235
00:10:49,238 --> 00:10:51,149
There you go. Much better.

236
00:10:51,656 --> 00:10:52,865
Now for the doctor.

237
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,338
What the …

238
00:11:07,922 --> 00:11:11,199
What the fuck are we doing out
here in the middle of the desert?

239
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:13,422
Somebody call the police.
We need help.

240
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,476
We need help.

241
00:11:14,554 --> 00:11:16,660
We need help. We need help.

242
00:11:25,086 --> 00:11:26,373
The truth.

243
00:11:27,465 --> 00:11:28,597
Truth?

244
00:11:29,845 --> 00:11:31,016
Now, we're going to Vegas …

245
00:11:31,093 --> 00:11:32,107
Vegas.

246
00:11:32,186 --> 00:11:35,540
To croak a scag baron named Savage Henry.

247
00:11:35,618 --> 00:11:36,554
It's true.

248
00:11:36,633 --> 00:11:39,987
Why? Because I've known him for
years but he ripped us off.

249
00:11:40,065 --> 00:11:41,938
And you know what that means.

250
00:11:42,015 --> 00:11:43,654
And you know what that means.
Right?

251
00:11:43,731 --> 00:11:44,668
No.

252
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:47,555
Savage Henry has cashed his check.

253
00:11:47,632 --> 00:11:49,193
Cashed his check.

254
00:11:49,895 --> 00:11:51,806
And we're gonna rip his lungs out.

255
00:11:52,938 --> 00:11:54,654
That bastard won't get away with this.

256
00:11:54,732 --> 00:11:58,009
I mean, what is going on in this
country when a scum sucker like that

257
00:11:58,087 --> 00:12:00,038
can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?

258
00:12:00,115 --> 00:12:01,129
Can you tell me that?

259
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:04,016
- Hey!
- Thanks for the ride! I like you guys!

260
00:12:04,094 --> 00:12:05,889
Really, don't worry about me!
Wait a minute!

261
00:12:05,966 --> 00:12:07,527
Come back and have a beer!

262
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:10,101
Shit. Fuck.

263
00:12:10,687 --> 00:12:11,700
I'm gonna miss him.

264
00:12:12,988 --> 00:12:14,626
Move over.
Did you see his eyes?

265
00:12:14,704 --> 00:12:16,889
We have to get out of California
before that kid finds a cop.

266
00:12:17,044 --> 00:12:18,800
Come on.
Scoot over, you fat bastard.

267
00:12:18,878 --> 00:12:20,478
We had a real freak on our hands!

268
00:12:20,555 --> 00:12:21,921
Oh, shit.

269
00:12:25,353 --> 00:12:28,006
<i>It was absolutely imperative that we get to the Mint Hotel</i>

270
00:12:28,084 --> 00:12:29,878
<i>before the deadline for press registration.</i>

271
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:33,038
<i>Otherwise we might have to pay for our suite.</i>

272
00:12:38,343 --> 00:12:39,436
Jesus!

273
00:12:39,982 --> 00:12:42,907
Did you see what God just did to us, man?

274
00:12:43,297 --> 00:12:44,663
God didn't do that.
You did it.

275
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,886
You're a fucking narcotics agent.
I knew it.

276
00:12:46,964 --> 00:12:48,602
That was our cocaine, you pig!

277
00:12:48,681 --> 00:12:50,280
You fucking pig, swine, whore!

278
00:12:50,357 --> 00:12:51,411
You better be careful.

279
00:12:52,192 --> 00:12:55,780
Plenty of vultures out here that'll
pick your bones clean before morning.

280
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,418
You fucking whore.

281
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:02,450
Here's your half
of the sunshine acid. Eat it.

282
00:13:02,528 --> 00:13:03,543
Yeah.

283
00:13:04,596 --> 00:13:05,727
Great.

284
00:13:06,936 --> 00:13:08,535
How long do I have?

285
00:13:08,614 --> 00:13:10,447
As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed

286
00:13:10,524 --> 00:13:12,670
or it'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there

287
00:13:12,749 --> 00:13:14,855
before you turn into a wild animal.

288
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,121
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

289
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:21,369
Are you ready for that?

290
00:13:21,447 --> 00:13:23,983
Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name

291
00:13:24,061 --> 00:13:26,948
with intent to commit capital
fraud and a head full of acid?

292
00:13:27,961 --> 00:13:29,288
I sure hope so.

293
00:13:29,756 --> 00:13:31,082
<i>30 minutes.</i>

294
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,721
<i>It was going to be very close.</i>

295
00:13:37,557 --> 00:13:39,352
<i>Well, she's all you'd ever want</i>

296
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,068
<i>She's the kind I'd like to flaunt</i>

297
00:13:41,147 --> 00:13:42,746
<i>And take to dinner</i>

298
00:13:42,901 --> 00:13:45,047
<i>Welcome to the Mint Hotel!</i>

299
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,646
<i>Well, she always knows her place</i>

300
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,714
<i>She's got style She's got grace</i>

301
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,469
<i>She's a winner</i>

302
00:13:52,225 --> 00:13:53,863
<i>She's a lady</i>

303
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,320
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa</i>

304
00:13:56,398 --> 00:13:57,686
<i>She's a lady</i>

305
00:13:57,764 --> 00:13:58,856
Hmm? Mmm.

306
00:13:58,934 --> 00:14:01,821
<i>Talking about my little lady</i>

307
00:14:01,938 --> 00:14:03,654
Come on, take the ticket.
We're busy here.

308
00:14:03,732 --> 00:14:04,785
<i>And the lady is mine</i>

309
00:14:04,863 --> 00:14:06,735
Come on, take the ticket.
Take it.

310
00:14:06,814 --> 00:14:08,374
Take the ticket.

311
00:14:10,441 --> 00:14:11,650
I need this, right?

312
00:14:11,963 --> 00:14:13,484
I'll remember your face.

313
00:14:15,395 --> 00:14:18,126
<i>There is no way of explaining the terror I felt.</i>

314
00:14:20,701 --> 00:14:23,509
<i>Attention, all Mint Hotel guests.</i>

315
00:14:23,587 --> 00:14:25,889
<i>Will the owner of a green Pinto</i>

316
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:29,165
<i>Minnesota license plate TG0432 …</i>

317
00:14:29,438 --> 00:14:31,116
<i>I was pouring sweat.</i>

318
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:33,651
<i>My blood is too thick for Nevada.</i>

319
00:14:33,964 --> 00:14:36,538
<i>I've never been able to properly
explain myself in this climate.</i>

320
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:41,024
<i>Okay. Be quiet, be calm.</i>

321
00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:45,315
<i>Name, rank and press affiliation.</i>

322
00:14:45,393 --> 00:14:46,329
<i>Nothing else.</i>

323
00:14:46,407 --> 00:14:49,177
… hamburger stand.
She was a waitress about 16 years old.

324
00:14:49,254 --> 00:14:51,751
They chopped her goddamn head off
right there in the parking lot.

325
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:54,677
Then they cut all kinds of holes
in her and sucked out the blood.

326
00:14:54,755 --> 00:14:56,706
They were after the pineal gland, I think.

327
00:14:56,783 --> 00:14:57,953
Yeah.

328
00:14:58,032 --> 00:14:59,241
No. How's your mama?

329
00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:00,723
<i>Ignore this terrible drug.</i>

330
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:02,790
<i>Yeah.</i>

331
00:15:03,063 --> 00:15:05,013
<i>Pretend it's not happening.</i>

332
00:15:06,262 --> 00:15:07,511
Hi there!

333
00:15:09,266 --> 00:15:10,475
My name?

334
00:15:13,088 --> 00:15:15,507
Raoul Duke!
On the list. Freelance.

335
00:15:15,585 --> 00:15:16,873
On the list, then?

336
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,433
Total coverage.

337
00:15:21,085 --> 00:15:23,543
I have my attorney …

338
00:15:26,741 --> 00:15:27,911
With me.

339
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:30,720
And I realize that his name is not on that list.

340
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,242
But we must have that suite!

341
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:34,387
Yes, we must have that suite.

342
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,610
What's the score here?

343
00:15:37,117 --> 00:15:38,443
What's next?

344
00:15:38,716 --> 00:15:40,667
Your suite isn't ready yet.

345
00:15:40,745 --> 00:15:43,397
But someone was looking for you.

346
00:15:43,983 --> 00:15:45,738
No! We haven't done
anything yet! Move!

347
00:15:45,816 --> 00:15:47,455
I can handle this.

348
00:15:48,391 --> 00:15:50,653
This man suffers from a bad heart.

349
00:15:50,732 --> 00:15:53,189
But I have plenty of medicine.
My name is Dr. Gonzo.

350
00:15:53,267 --> 00:15:56,193
Prepare our suite at once.
We'll be in the bar.

351
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,303
I don't know about you, but I'm
starting to feel that drink.

352
00:16:16,516 --> 00:16:18,973
Hey, beat it.
Beat it. Go on.

353
00:16:21,001 --> 00:16:22,952
Well, I like the way you did that.

354
00:16:24,005 --> 00:16:26,424
Come on. Come on. Come on.

355
00:16:26,502 --> 00:16:28,843
- What's that?
- Come on, come on. Let's get some peanuts.

356
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,066
- Peanuts?
- That's one thing that's good for you, man.

357
00:16:31,143 --> 00:16:32,704
Peanuts, man.
Jesus!

358
00:16:32,782 --> 00:16:34,694
2 Cuba Libres, beer and mescal on the side.

359
00:16:34,771 --> 00:16:36,097
You got it.

360
00:16:37,385 --> 00:16:39,258
I'll bet you're a Libra.
Mmm.

361
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,450
Who's Lacerda?
Lacerda?

362
00:16:47,527 --> 00:16:49,594
Yeah, he's waiting for us on the 12th floor.

363
00:16:49,673 --> 00:16:51,858
Room 1250. Lacerda.

364
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:54,237
<i>I couldn't remember.</i>

365
00:16:54,861 --> 00:16:57,123
<i>The name rang a bell, but I couldn't concentrate.</i>

366
00:16:57,865 --> 00:17:00,322
<i>Terrible things were happening all around us.</i>

367
00:17:02,194 --> 00:17:03,676
Buy us some golf shoes,

368
00:17:03,755 --> 00:17:05,939
otherwise we'll never get out of this place alive.

369
00:17:07,382 --> 00:17:09,294
Impossible to walk in this muck.

370
00:17:09,372 --> 00:17:10,971
No footing at all.

371
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:17,446
<i>Mr. Roger Pratt, please
call the hotel operator.</i>

372
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:23,180
<i>How can I bear to see your heart break?</i>

373
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:26,224
<i>To see your heart break</i>

374
00:17:26,301 --> 00:17:28,369
<i>Over me</i>

375
00:17:52,164 --> 00:17:55,167
<i>I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo</i>

376
00:17:55,246 --> 00:17:57,781
<i>and somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things.</i>

377
00:17:58,366 --> 00:18:01,447
<i>It won't be long now before they tear us to shreds.</i>

378
00:18:15,023 --> 00:18:16,153
Please!

379
00:18:16,543 --> 00:18:19,041
Tell them to get out their fucking golf shoes!

380
00:18:20,796 --> 00:18:23,175
Jesus God Almighty, look at that bunch over there, man.

381
00:18:23,253 --> 00:18:24,852
They've spotted us.

382
00:18:24,931 --> 00:18:26,764
That's the press table, man.

383
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,260
We're gonna have to sign in for our credentials.

384
00:18:31,406 --> 00:18:32,537
Okay?

385
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,540
Are you ready?
Hmm?

386
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:37,023
Are you ready?

387
00:18:37,842 --> 00:18:41,119
- Come on, hurry up.
- Wait! Wait, wait! Fucking don't leave me here!

388
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:44,318
Two club sandwiches,

389
00:18:44,396 --> 00:18:47,165
and 2 more club sandwiches.

390
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:51,261
One, two, three, four shrimp cocktails.

391
00:18:52,354 --> 00:18:54,108
Hmm?
And nine fresh grapefruit.

392
00:18:54,187 --> 00:18:56,020
Vitamin C.
Need all we can get.

393
00:18:56,137 --> 00:18:59,180
Four chicken … There's a big machine in the sky.

394
00:18:59,258 --> 00:19:01,013
Some kind of … Quart of rum.

395
00:19:01,091 --> 00:19:03,666
Well, electric snake coming straight at us.

396
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,109
Shoot it.

397
00:19:05,304 --> 00:19:07,488
Not yet.
I want to study its habits.

398
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:10,843
You motorcycle people sure are hearty eaters.

399
00:19:11,468 --> 00:19:13,730
I need the cart. I need
to return with the cart.

400
00:19:13,808 --> 00:19:16,772
Thank you, but the cart needs to go back with--
I'll be back!

401
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,684
You bastard.
I've been hit, man!

402
00:19:18,762 --> 00:19:20,830
I leave you alone for three minutes

403
00:19:20,907 --> 00:19:22,506
and you start waving that goddamn

404
00:19:22,585 --> 00:19:25,081
marlin spike around yelling about reptiles.

405
00:19:25,354 --> 00:19:26,564
What're you talking about, man?

406
00:19:26,641 --> 00:19:28,241
You scared the shit out of those people.

407
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:29,723
They were ready to call the cops.

408
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,868
Yes, sir, you were lucky I came back in time.

409
00:19:31,947 --> 00:19:33,311
Don't come near me.

410
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,029
Don't come fucking near me!

411
00:19:36,316 --> 00:19:37,252
Leave me alone.

412
00:19:37,329 --> 00:19:38,929
Hell, the only reason they gave us press passes

413
00:19:39,007 --> 00:19:40,840
was to get you out of there, man.

414
00:19:40,997 --> 00:19:42,557
Oh, God! What's that?

415
00:19:42,635 --> 00:19:44,936
That scene straightened me right out, man.

416
00:19:45,209 --> 00:19:46,808
Who's at the door?

417
00:19:48,915 --> 00:19:50,398
<i>As the bombing continues in Laos …</i>

418
00:19:50,475 --> 00:19:51,607
Just a minute.

419
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,610
Holy shit. Oh, my God.

420
00:19:57,379 --> 00:20:01,164
Hi. I'm Lacerda,
your photographer.

421
00:20:06,741 --> 00:20:07,756

Mmm-hmm.

422
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:10,019
Back there.

423
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,384
Duke?

424
00:20:12,047 --> 00:20:13,373
Duke? Hi!

425

Lacerda. Your photographer.

426

You're not Portuguese, man!

427
00:20:18,678 --> 00:20:21,253
Hey, too bad you guys missed the bikes checking in.

428
00:20:21,331 --> 00:20:23,165
Oh, man, what a sight!

429
00:20:23,242 --> 00:20:26,909
Husquavarnas, Yamahas, DMZs.

Kawasakis!

431

Swedish Fireballs.

433
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:37,246
Couple of Triumphs.
Here and there a CZ.

434
00:20:37,324 --> 00:20:39,587
All very, very fast.

435
00:20:40,094 --> 00:20:41,108
Very.

436
00:20:41,654 --> 00:20:43,605
What a race it's gonna be.

437
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:49,963
Yeah.

438
00:20:53,434 --> 00:20:55,307
I'm gonna let myself out.

439
00:20:56,399 --> 00:20:58,311
- We know what you're up to, man.
- Hmm?

440
00:21:08,765 --> 00:21:10,481
I'm gonna tell you …

441
00:21:10,715 --> 00:21:14,304
He's lying to us.
I could see it in his eyes.

442
00:21:14,538 --> 00:21:15,592
Eyes?

443

<i>Late battle reports indicate …</i>

<i>It was time to get grounded,</i>

00:22:52,643 --> 00:22:54,399
<i>And away we go!</i>

483
00:22:54,477 --> 00:22:56,583
<i>We've got rooster tails going!</i>

484
00:22:56,661 --> 00:22:58,846
<i>We're here to spit in your enemy's eye!</i>

485
00:22:58,924 --> 00:22:59,860
There they go.

486
00:23:02,045 --> 00:23:04,385
<i>All right, our second group of 10 is getting in place.</i>

487
00:23:04,463 --> 00:23:07,076
<i>Kawasakis, Triumphs, Maicos.</i>

488
00:23:07,154 --> 00:23:08,949
<i>Here we are.
We're ready to go.</i>

489
00:23:09,026 --> 00:23:10,782
<i>It's the green flag, and they're off!</i>

490
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,747
<i>Another great start with a lot
of dirt happening on this hill!</i>

491
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:15,502
<i>All right, here we go with the third group.</i>

492
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,218
<i>And they're off!</i>

493
00:23:17,297 --> 00:23:20,652
<i>Here we go.
Number 45 riding in the number 4 position</i>

494
00:23:20,729 --> 00:23:23,109
<i>is choking as the dust flies!</i>

495
00:23:23,187 --> 00:23:26,541
<i>You'd better wet those bandannas
you got stretched over your face!</i>

496
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:30,404
<i>There was something like 190 more bikes waiting to start.</i>

497
00:23:30,481 --> 00:23:31,417
Give me a beer, man.

498
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:32,939
<i>They were due to go off, 10 at a time</i>

499
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:35,045
<i>every two minutes.</i>

500
00:23:36,176 --> 00:23:37,737
There you go, buddy.

501
00:23:41,013 --> 00:23:44,407
- Goddamn it. What day is it? Saturday?
- Shit.

502
00:23:44,485 --> 00:23:46,007
More like Sunday.

503
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:51,975
Hello! Anyone?

504
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:53,964
Have you seen the race?

505
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:57,435
<i>By 10:00, they were spread out all over the course.</i>

506
00:23:57,865 --> 00:23:59,699
<i>It was no longer a race.</i>

507
00:23:59,933 --> 00:24:02,116
<i>Now it was an endurance contest.</i>

508
00:24:02,819 --> 00:24:04,497
<i>The idea of trying to cover this race</i>

509
00:24:04,574 --> 00:24:06,837
<i>in any conventional press sense was absurd.</i>

510
00:24:06,915 --> 00:24:09,255
Hey! It's pretty great, huh?
What?

511
00:24:09,879 --> 00:24:11,206
Come on in!

512
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:19,241
I'm just gonna try different
combinations of lenses and film

513
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,206
until I find something that works in this dust!

514
00:24:24,118 --> 00:24:25,366
What the hell?

515
00:24:26,536 --> 00:24:29,149
That's fucking machine guns, man.
They're firing at us.

516
00:24:29,228 --> 00:24:31,841
Machine guns.
It's a goddamn war zone!

517
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,167
Get us out of here quick!

518
00:24:33,284 --> 00:24:34,689
Quick, man!

519
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:36,561
We're gonna be killed, for fuck's sake!

520
00:24:36,639 --> 00:24:39,330
What the …
Oh, no. Oh, God. Oh, God.

521
00:24:39,409 --> 00:24:40,930
Oh, God.

522
00:24:42,646 --> 00:24:44,480
Where's the damn race?

523
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:46,469
Beats me, man.

524
00:24:46,664 --> 00:24:49,044
We're just good, patriotic Americans like yourself.

525
00:24:50,643 --> 00:24:52,750
What outfit you fellows with?

526
00:24:52,983 --> 00:24:55,714
Oh. The sporting press.
We're friendlies.

527
00:24:56,455 --> 00:24:57,781
Hired geeks.

528
00:25:01,878 --> 00:25:02,931
Yeah.

529
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:04,881
Let's go.

530
00:25:06,207 --> 00:25:07,456
Good luck, gentlemen.

531
00:25:07,533 --> 00:25:08,782
Get him!

532
00:25:09,016 --> 00:25:10,810
Freaks.
Take me back to the pits.

533
00:25:10,888 --> 00:25:12,995
No! No, no, no.
We have to go on.

534
00:25:13,073 --> 00:25:14,906
We need total coverage!

535
00:25:14,984 --> 00:25:16,349
<i>It was time, I felt,</i>

536
00:25:16,428 --> 00:25:18,690
<i>for an agonizing reappraisal of the whole scene.</i>

537
00:25:19,314 --> 00:25:20,445
You're fired.

538
00:25:21,889 --> 00:25:23,332
Awful jackass.

539
00:25:25,126 --> 00:25:26,374
All right.

540
00:25:26,453 --> 00:25:27,662
Just drive into the dust!

541
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,910
I never wanna see you again.

542
00:25:28,988 --> 00:25:31,446
Just drive into the dust!

543
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,616
Huh?

544
00:25:33,435 --> 00:25:34,371
Oh!

545
00:25:37,843 --> 00:25:40,066
<i>The race was definitely underway.</i>

546
00:25:40,379 --> 00:25:41,861
<i>I had witnessed the start.</i>

547
00:25:41,978 --> 00:25:43,499
<i>I was sure of that much.</i>

548
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,293
<i>But what now?</i>

549
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,361
<i>What comes next?</i>

550
00:25:54,655 --> 00:25:55,865
Put on the radio.

551
00:25:55,942 --> 00:25:57,113
Turn on the tape machine.

552
00:25:57,191 --> 00:25:59,103
Roll every goddamn window down.

553
00:25:59,376 --> 00:26:01,404
Let us taste this cool desert wind.

554
00:26:02,535 --> 00:26:05,149
Ah, yes.
This is what it's all about.

555
00:26:05,694 --> 00:26:07,294
<i>Total control now.</i>

556
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,337
<i>Tooling along the main drag on a Saturday night in Vegas.</i>

557
00:26:11,429 --> 00:26:13,419
<i>Two good old boys in a fire-apple red convertible.</i>

558
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:16,110
<i>Stoned, ripped …</i>

559
00:26:16,773 --> 00:26:18,880
<i>Twisted, good people.</i>

560
00:26:19,543 --> 00:26:21,727
Hot fuck.
That sounds heavy.

561
00:26:22,507 --> 00:26:24,418
29 cent hot dogs.

562
00:26:25,472 --> 00:26:27,149
What are we doing here?

563
00:26:27,227 --> 00:26:29,645
Are we here to entertain ourselves or do the job?

564
00:26:29,724 --> 00:26:31,284
Do the job, of course.

565
00:26:31,362 --> 00:26:32,416
Here we go.

566
00:26:32,493 --> 00:26:35,926
Crab Louie and a quart of muscatel for $20.

567
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:40,568
As your attorney, I advise you
to drive over to the Tropicana.

568
00:26:40,646 --> 00:26:43,338
Guy Lombardo. He's in the Blue
Room with his Royal Canadians.

569
00:26:43,415 --> 00:26:44,351
Why?

570
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:45,444
Why? Why what?

571
00:26:46,224 --> 00:26:49,969
Why should I pay my hard-earned
dollars to watch a fucking corpse?

572
00:26:50,047 --> 00:26:51,373
I don't know about you,

573
00:26:51,451 --> 00:26:54,221
but in my line of business it's important to be hep.

574
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,913
What the hell do you think you're doing?

575
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,487
This is not a parking area!
You've got to move your car!

576
00:26:59,565 --> 00:27:02,022
You can't park your car here.
Excuse me. Sir!

577
00:27:02,101 --> 00:27:03,154
What?

578
00:27:03,231 --> 00:27:04,207
You can't park … Hey!

579
00:27:04,285 --> 00:27:05,729
You can't park your car here!

580
00:27:05,806 --> 00:27:06,742
Why not?

581
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,302
Is this not a reasonable place to park?

582
00:27:08,381 --> 00:27:09,941
Reasonable?
You're on a sidewalk!

583
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,228
It's a sidewalk!

584
00:27:11,307 --> 00:27:13,023
This is not a parking area!
Debbie Reynolds?

585
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,583
You can't park on the sidewalk!

586
00:27:14,661 --> 00:27:15,637
Seems like a hot ticket.

587
00:27:15,714 --> 00:27:16,845
Excuse me, sir?

588
00:27:16,924 --> 00:27:19,303
Drove all the way from L.A.
for this show.

589
00:27:19,849 --> 00:27:21,332
We're friends of Debbie's.

590
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,389
Okay, bye.
We'll see you later.

591
00:27:25,466 --> 00:27:27,416
<i>This was Bob Hope's turf,</i>

592
00:27:27,495 --> 00:27:28,665
<i>Strangers in the night</i>

593
00:27:28,743 --> 00:27:30,888
<i>Frank Sinatra's, Spiro Agnew's.</i>

594
00:27:30,967 --> 00:27:32,449
<i>Exchanging glances</i>

595
00:27:32,527 --> 00:27:35,998
<i>The place fairly reeked of high-grade
Formica and plastic palm trees.</i>

596
00:27:36,623 --> 00:27:40,055
<i>Clearly a high-class
refuge for big spenders.</i>

597
00:27:41,615 --> 00:27:43,098
It's started.
Is she on stage?

598
00:27:43,176 --> 00:27:44,580
She is. Sold out.

599
00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:47,389
Sorry, sir.
Full house. I'm sorry, sir.

600
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,495
We drove all the way
from L.A. for this show.

601
00:27:49,574 --> 00:27:51,602
I said there are no seats left, sir, at any price.

602
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,772
Fuck seats!

603
00:27:53,201 --> 00:27:54,605
We're friends with Debbie.

604
00:27:54,684 --> 00:27:56,165
I used to romp with her.

605
00:27:58,857 --> 00:28:00,222
Are you prepared to go to court?

606
00:28:00,339 --> 00:28:01,705
Well, that depends.

607
00:28:01,782 --> 00:28:04,163
I wanna talk to you for a second.

608
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,128
Your attitude constitutes a breach of faith.

609
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:10,014
In Nevada, that's illegal.

610
00:28:11,496 --> 00:28:12,510
What's your name?

611
00:28:12,588 --> 00:28:14,461
My name? Tony Pizzacata.

612
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:16,372
Tony Pizzacata.

613
00:28:16,879 --> 00:28:18,907
What, may I ask, is your name, sir?

614
00:28:18,986 --> 00:28:21,014
It's on my driver's license.

615
00:28:21,131 --> 00:28:24,447
I think we might be able to squeeze you in, sir.

616
00:28:24,524 --> 00:28:25,539
Thank you kindly.

617
00:28:25,617 --> 00:28:27,295
You'll have to stand in the back.

618
00:28:28,465 --> 00:28:31,546
<i>After a lot of bad noise he let us in for nothing</i>

619
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:35,018
<i>provided we would stand quietly in the back and not smoke.</i>

620
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,383
Excellent.

621
00:28:37,203 --> 00:28:38,333
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

622
00:28:38,412 --> 00:28:41,142
<i>the Desert Inn is proud to present the one, the only,</i>

623
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:44,107
<i>the incomparable Miss Debbie Reynolds!</i>

624
00:28:44,341 --> 00:28:45,902
<i>Ooh, ooh</i>

625
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:48,008
<i>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen!</i>

626
00:28:48,085 --> 00:28:51,284
<i>It's wonderful to be here with all you fabulous people!</i>

627
00:28:51,986 --> 00:28:54,366
<i>Let's rock and roll!</i>

628
00:28:54,639 --> 00:28:56,121
<i>Sgt. Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band</i>

629
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,500
Hey!
What the hell's going on?

630
00:28:58,735 --> 00:29:00,100
Get them out!

631
00:29:00,256 --> 00:29:01,661
Come on, get out of here!

632
00:29:01,817 --> 00:29:03,338
Get them out.

633
00:29:03,844 --> 00:29:04,899
Out!

634
00:29:14,143 --> 00:29:17,342
Shit! We wandered into
a fucking time capsule there.

635
00:29:18,161 --> 00:29:19,565
Scumbag!

636
00:29:19,643 --> 00:29:23,271
I'll find where you live and burn
your house down, you piece of shit!

637
00:29:24,324 --> 00:29:26,002
What happened?
Oh.

638
00:29:26,509 --> 00:29:29,590
One of these days I'll toss a fucking bomb in that place.

639
00:29:42,619 --> 00:29:44,140
Oh, wait. You see that?

640
00:29:44,219 --> 00:29:45,700
This is the place, man.

641
00:29:45,973 --> 00:29:47,768
They'll never fuck with us here.

642
00:29:49,211 --> 00:29:51,435
Where's the ether?
Mescaline's not working.

643
00:29:51,669 --> 00:29:52,644
Oh.

644
00:29:55,648 --> 00:29:57,599
There we go. Right.

645
00:30:02,006 --> 00:30:03,800
Yeah. Why not?

646
00:30:05,946 --> 00:30:06,999
Yeah.

647
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,138
<i>Devil ether.</i>

648
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:18,350
<i>It makes you behave like the village
drunkard in some early Irish novel.</i>

649
00:30:18,429 --> 00:30:20,769
<i>Total loss of all basic motor skills.</i>

650
00:30:20,847 --> 00:30:23,577
<i>Blurred vision, no balance, numb tongue.</i>

651
00:30:23,694 --> 00:30:25,684
<i>The mind recoils in horror,</i>

652
00:30:25,762 --> 00:30:28,102
<i>unable to communicate with the spinal column,</i>

653
00:30:28,181 --> 00:30:30,170
<i>which is interesting because you
can actually watch yourself</i>

654
00:30:30,248 --> 00:30:33,642
<i>behaving in this terrible way but you can't control it.</i>

655
00:30:37,464 --> 00:30:40,507
<i>You approach the turnstiles and
know that when you get there</i>

656
00:30:40,585 --> 00:30:43,354
<i>you have to give the man $2 or he won't let you inside.</i>

657
00:30:43,433 --> 00:30:46,671
<i>But when you get there everything goes wrong.</i>

658
00:30:47,918 --> 00:30:49,245
<i>Some angry Rotarian shoves you</i>

659
00:30:49,323 --> 00:30:50,610
<i>and you think, "What's happening here?</i>

660
00:30:50,689 --> 00:30:51,859
<i>"What's going on?"</i>

661
00:30:51,936 --> 00:30:53,458
<i>And you hear yourself mumbling.</i>

662
00:30:53,536 --> 00:30:56,110
Dogs fucked the Pope.
No fault of mine.

663
00:30:58,295 --> 00:31:00,869
<i>Ether is the perfect drug for Las Vegas.</i>

664
00:31:01,221 --> 00:31:04,146
<i>In this town they love a drunk.
Fresh meat.</i>

665
00:31:04,224 --> 00:31:05,902
Come on, buddy. Come on.
Holy …

666
00:31:05,979 --> 00:31:09,763
<i>So they put us through the turnstiles
and turned us loose inside.</i>

667
00:31:10,387 --> 00:31:12,572
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

668
00:31:12,649 --> 00:31:14,405
<i>boys and girls,</i>

669
00:31:14,483 --> 00:31:17,487
<i>visitors of all ages,</i>

670
00:31:17,565 --> 00:31:21,700
<i>the Bazooko Casino Circus proudly presents,</i>

671
00:31:21,778 --> 00:31:24,782
<i>the Flying Fellinis!</i>

672
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:50,643
Oh, my God!

673
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,456
Fuck!

674
00:32:27,311 --> 00:32:28,677
Excuse me.

675
00:32:28,754 --> 00:32:31,017
Get out of my way, you …

676
00:32:34,645 --> 00:32:36,283
<i>A drug person can learn to cope with things like</i>

677
00:32:36,361 --> 00:32:39,248
<i>seeing their dead grandmother crawling
up their leg with a knife in her teeth,</i>

678
00:32:39,326 --> 00:32:41,823
<i>but nobody should be asked to handle this trip.</i>

679
00:32:42,603 --> 00:32:45,568
<i>Bazooko Circus is what the whole hep
world would be doing Saturday night</i>

680
00:32:45,645 --> 00:32:47,518
<i>if the Nazis had won the War.</i>

681
00:32:47,595 --> 00:32:49,039
<i>This was the Sixth Reich.</i>

682
00:32:49,117 --> 00:32:52,042
Place your bets! Where everyone's
a winner and nobody's a loser!

683
00:32:52,121 --> 00:32:56,216
Step right up and shoot the pasties off
the nipples of a 10-foot bull dyke

684
00:32:56,294 --> 00:32:58,089
and win a cotton candy goat!

685
00:33:03,823 --> 00:33:05,461
Step up to this fantastic machine!

686
00:33:05,539 --> 00:33:09,206
For just 99 cents, your likeness will appear 200 feet tall

687
00:33:09,284 --> 00:33:11,118
on a screen over downtown Las Vegas.

688
00:33:11,196 --> 00:33:13,497
For just 99 cents more you can have a voice message!

689
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:14,863
Say whatever you want, fellow!

690
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,227
Oh, they'll hear you, all right!

691
00:33:16,306 --> 00:33:18,256
You'll be 200 feet tall!

692
00:33:19,309 --> 00:33:21,064
<i>The ether was wearing off.</i>

693
00:33:21,143 --> 00:33:22,976
<i>The acid was long gone.</i>

694
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,434
<i>But the mescaline was running strong.</i>

695
00:33:26,565 --> 00:33:28,633
<i>Good mescaline comes on slow.</i>

696
00:33:28,866 --> 00:33:30,895
<i>The first hour's all waiting.</i>

697
00:33:30,973 --> 00:33:33,001
<i>And then about halfway through its second hour,</i>

698
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:36,044
<i>you start cursing the creep who burned
you because nothing's happening.</i>

699
00:33:36,122 --> 00:33:37,994
<i>And then, zang!</i>

700
00:33:38,501 --> 00:33:42,012
I hate to say this but this place is getting to me.

701
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:45,366
I think I'm getting the fear.

702
00:33:45,445 --> 00:33:46,849
Nonsense.

703
00:33:46,966 --> 00:33:48,370
We came here to find the American Dream.

704
00:33:48,448 --> 00:33:51,179
Now that we're right in the vortex, you wanna quit?

705
00:33:51,256 --> 00:33:53,637
You must realize, man, we've found the main nerve.

706
00:33:53,714 --> 00:33:55,937
That's what gives me the fear.

707
00:33:56,016 --> 00:33:57,810
Oh, look!
What?

708
00:33:58,551 --> 00:34:01,282
There's two women fucking a polar bear.

709
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,622
Don't tell me those things.

710
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,495
Not now, man.

711
00:34:06,431 --> 00:34:08,108
This is my last drink.

712
00:34:08,226 --> 00:34:09,903
How much money can you lend me?

713
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,463
Not much. Why?

714
00:34:11,541 --> 00:34:13,335
I have to go.
Go?

715
00:34:13,414 --> 00:34:15,324
Yeah. Leave the country.

716
00:34:15,403 --> 00:34:16,768
Oh, no. Calm down.

717
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,251
You'll be straight in a few hours.

718
00:34:18,329 --> 00:34:19,694
Just sit down.
Sit the fuck down.

719
00:34:19,772 --> 00:34:22,463
Don't fuck around, man.
This is serious.

720
00:34:22,542 --> 00:34:25,272
One more hour in this town, I'll kill somebody.

721
00:34:26,637 --> 00:34:28,822
Okay, I'll lend you some money.

722
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:31,279
Come with me.

723
00:34:31,631 --> 00:34:33,151
I wanna leave fast.
Okay.

724
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:36,233
Let's pay this bill, get up very slowly.

725
00:34:37,052 --> 00:34:38,886
I think it's gonna be a long walk.

726
00:34:38,964 --> 00:34:40,251
Light, sir?

727
00:34:42,396 --> 00:34:44,854
Do they pay you to screw that bear?

728
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:46,337
What?

729
00:34:46,687 --> 00:34:47,741
What?

730
00:34:47,897 --> 00:34:49,925
- What the fuck did he say to me?
- He's drunk.

731
00:34:50,003 --> 00:34:51,954
You'd better take care of your friend.

732
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:54,528
Madam, sir, baby, child, whatever, can I pay?

733
00:34:54,606 --> 00:34:56,517
Here, take this.
That should be enough.

734
00:34:56,596 --> 00:34:59,131
All right, come on.
Let's go downstairs and gamble.

735
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,202
You guys don't fucking give up.

736
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,918
Where'd he go?

737
00:35:06,191 --> 00:35:07,830
Where did he go?

738
00:35:11,302 --> 00:35:13,330
- When is this thing gonna stop?
- Stop?

739
00:35:13,447 --> 00:35:16,568
- Stop it!
- It won't stop. It's never gonna stop, man.

740
00:35:16,646 --> 00:35:18,323
Don't move. You'll fall down.

741
00:35:18,791 --> 00:35:20,430
Fuck, he's …

742
00:35:21,131 --> 00:35:23,589
Where did he go? Oh.

743
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:25,657
Come on. Let go.

744
00:35:25,812 --> 00:35:28,036
Quick, like a bunny.
Hop! Hop!

745
00:35:28,582 --> 00:35:30,220
Come on. Hop!
I can't!

746
00:35:30,299 --> 00:35:33,537
Oh, you sniveling, chicken shit bastard!
Stop it!

747
00:35:36,696 --> 00:35:38,178
All right.

748
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:45,590
Fuck!

749
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:47,736
Come on.
You fell, you fell. Let's go.

750
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:50,115
Son of a bitch.
You pushed me.

751
00:35:50,193 --> 00:35:51,753
Go away!
Come on.

752
00:35:52,026 --> 00:35:54,289
All right. You stay here
and go to jail. I'm leaving.

753
00:35:55,107 --> 00:35:56,590
Come on, you fiend!

754
00:35:56,668 --> 00:35:58,424
Step right over …
Nothing. I want nothing.

755
00:35:58,501 --> 00:36:00,061
Did you see that?

756
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:01,934
Come on.

757
00:36:02,012 --> 00:36:04,235
Some son of a bitch just kicked me in the back.

758
00:36:04,314 --> 00:36:05,289
Probably the bartender.

759
00:36:05,367 --> 00:36:07,278
Wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.

760
00:36:07,356 --> 00:36:10,048
Holy moley! Holy moley!
Cows are gonna kill me!

761
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,154
Bisexuals are gonna kill me.

762
00:36:12,544 --> 00:36:14,066
Let's get out of here.
Where's the elevator?

763
00:36:14,144 --> 00:36:15,821
No, fuck! Don't go
near the elevator, man!

764
00:36:15,899 --> 00:36:17,538
That's just what they want us to do.

765
00:36:17,615 --> 00:36:21,204
Trap us in a steel box, take us down to the basement.
Come here.

766
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:25,456
Don't run, man.

767
00:36:25,534 --> 00:36:27,484
They'd like any excuse to shoot us.

768
00:36:30,059 --> 00:36:31,854
You drive. You drive.

769
00:36:32,868 --> 00:36:35,872
I think there's something wrong with me.

770
00:36:41,216 --> 00:36:42,971
Wrong door. Wrong door.

771
00:36:43,595 --> 00:36:45,935
<i>This is not a good town for psychedelic drugs.</i>

772
00:36:46,794 --> 00:36:49,134
<i>Extremely menacing vibrations were all around us.</i>

773
00:36:50,031 --> 00:36:51,475
<i>We finally made it to the room,</i>

774
00:36:52,021 --> 00:36:53,893
<i>but the key wouldn't open the door.</i>

775
00:36:55,024 --> 00:36:57,248
Those bastards have changed the lock on us, man.

776
00:36:58,028 --> 00:36:59,237
Already?

777
00:36:59,823 --> 00:37:02,280
They probably searched the room, man.

778
00:37:02,865 --> 00:37:04,971
Jesus Christ, we're finished.

779
00:37:07,584 --> 00:37:09,613
Move out of the way.
Look out! Look out!

780
00:37:12,851 --> 00:37:15,230
Bolt everything!
Use all the chains!

781
00:37:17,571 --> 00:37:19,365
That's better. That's better.

782
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:23,578
Where did this one come from?

783
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:26,816
That's Lacerda's.

784
00:37:26,894 --> 00:37:29,390
Yeah. Yeah.
I thought we might need it.

785
00:37:29,819 --> 00:37:31,029
What for?

786
00:37:31,419 --> 00:37:32,355
What for?

787
00:37:32,433 --> 00:37:35,826
So we can go up there and blast him out of bed

788
00:37:35,905 --> 00:37:37,231
with a fire hose, man.

789
00:37:38,128 --> 00:37:40,351
I think we should leave that poor bastard alone.

790
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:42,068
He told me he was gonna turn in early, so …

791
00:37:42,146 --> 00:37:43,551
I knew it.

792
00:37:44,058 --> 00:37:46,242
He got a hold of my woman, man!

793
00:37:47,061 --> 00:37:49,986
You mean that blonde groupie with the film crew?

794
00:37:50,338 --> 00:37:52,327
Shit.
Think he sodomized her?

795
00:37:52,405 --> 00:37:54,122
That's right.
Laugh about it.

796
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,478
He's gluing her eyes shut right now, man.

797
00:37:55,526 --> 00:37:58,178
You goddamn honkies are all the same.

798
00:37:58,257 --> 00:38:00,714
You goddamn honkies are all the same.

799
00:38:02,157 --> 00:38:05,122
Jesus God Almighty, man, where'd you get that big fucker?

800
00:38:06,058 --> 00:38:07,930
Room service sent it up.

801
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:10,739
I needed something to cut the limes, man.

802
00:38:11,675 --> 00:38:13,899
Limes? What limes?

803
00:38:14,289 --> 00:38:15,342
They didn't have any.

804
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,215
They don't grow in the desert.

805
00:38:17,292 --> 00:38:19,321
That dirty toad bastard.

806
00:38:20,257 --> 00:38:22,949
Should've taken him out when I had a chance.

807
00:38:24,977 --> 00:38:26,654
Now he has her, man!

808
00:38:27,903 --> 00:38:30,048
He got a hold of my baby, yeah.

809
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,271
<i>I remembered the girl.</i>

810
00:38:32,701 --> 00:38:35,470
<i>We'd had a problem with her in the
elevator a few hours earlier.</i>

811
00:38:35,548 --> 00:38:37,888
<i>My attorney had made a fool of himself.</i>

812
00:38:38,668 --> 00:38:40,346
I think you look just like him.

813
00:38:40,463 --> 00:38:41,750
You think so?

814
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:50,684
You must be a rider.
Hmm?

815
00:38:52,868 --> 00:38:54,779
She's speaking to you.

816
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,826
What class are you in?

817
00:39:00,903 --> 00:39:02,035
Class?

818
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:04,102
What the fuck do you mean?

819
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,974
What do you ride?

820
00:39:06,091 --> 00:39:09,641
See, we're here getting a little footage on the race for

821
00:39:09,915 --> 00:39:11,591
a television series.

822
00:39:11,826 --> 00:39:14,127
I thought maybe we could use you.

823
00:39:15,336 --> 00:39:17,755
Oh, use me? I ride a …

824
00:39:18,067 --> 00:39:20,953
<i>"Mother of God," I thought.
Here it comes.</i>

825
00:39:21,032 --> 00:39:23,724
I ride the big fuckers.
You know? Big ones.

826
00:39:24,152 --> 00:39:26,259
The really big fuckers. Yeah.

827
00:39:26,649 --> 00:39:28,248
Vincent Black Shadow.

828
00:39:28,326 --> 00:39:30,121
We're with the factory team.

829
00:39:30,198 --> 00:39:31,408
Right.
Bullshit.

830
00:39:31,486 --> 00:39:32,500
What?

831
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:33,826
Bullshit.

832
00:39:34,256 --> 00:39:35,192
Hmm?

833
00:39:36,752 --> 00:39:38,195
I think there's some kind of ignorant,

834
00:39:38,274 --> 00:39:39,677
chicken shit … Move over, man.

835
00:39:39,756 --> 00:39:42,448
An ignorant chicken fucker in this town.

836
00:39:43,695 --> 00:39:45,451
You pink motherfucker.

837
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,415
I can show you better than I can tell you, ma'am.

838
00:39:48,493 --> 00:39:49,819
Got a light?

839
00:39:52,238 --> 00:39:53,447
No.

840
00:39:58,557 --> 00:40:00,781
You don't trust me, do you?
Huh?

841
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:04,097
- Put the smile away.
- It's okay. I know these guys.

842
00:40:04,175 --> 00:40:06,516
Keep trying me, jerk-off.
Keep trying me.

843
00:40:06,593 --> 00:40:07,725
You wanna impress her?

844
00:40:07,802 --> 00:40:08,934
Well, impress her with me.

845
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,743
Oh, fuck.

846
00:40:19,856 --> 00:40:22,392
No, you goddamn freak! Freak!

847
00:40:24,342 --> 00:40:26,683
The police will be coming after you.

848
00:40:26,994 --> 00:40:27,969
<i>For your love</i>

849

Put the knife away.

854
00:40:41,506 --> 00:40:42,637
I been walking all day.
Come on.

855
00:40:42,715 --> 00:40:44,704
It's in my pocket. Come on.

856
00:40:45,913 --> 00:40:47,006

00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:58,318
It's serious now, man.

861
00:41:00,346 --> 00:41:02,141
That girl understood, man.

862
00:41:04,442 --> 00:41:05,417
Whew.

863
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:07,602
She fell in love with me, man.

864
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:09,279
Eye contact, man.

865
00:41:11,074 --> 00:41:12,204
Wait.

866
00:41:18,563 --> 00:41:20,357
I should go up there and castrate that fucker.

867
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,308
I'll take the blame, man.

868
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:25,311
Let's just leave that weird fucker alone, man.
Come on.

869
00:41:26,131 --> 00:41:28,276
Have you made a deal with him?

870
00:41:28,783 --> 00:41:32,021
Did you put him on to her?
Huh? Huh?

871
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:34,908
Huh?

872
00:41:35,961 --> 00:41:37,404
All right, look …

873
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:40,720
You better put that goddamn blade away, man.

874
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:42,826
Get your fucking head straight.

875
00:41:42,904 --> 00:41:44,698
I'm gonna go get the car washed.

876
00:41:45,167 --> 00:41:46,337
<i>One of the things you learn</i>

877
00:41:46,415 --> 00:41:48,405
<i>after years of dealing with drug people,</i>

878
00:41:48,482 --> 00:41:50,628
<i>is that you can turn your back on a person,</i>

879
00:41:50,706 --> 00:41:53,436
<i>but never turn your back on a drug.</i>

880
00:41:53,632 --> 00:41:56,674
<i>Especially when it's waving a
razor-sharp hunting knife in your eye.</i>

<i>What was I doing out here?</i>

882
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:08,845
<i>What was the meaning of this trip?</i>

883
00:42:09,664 --> 00:42:12,277
<i>Was I just roaming around in a drug frenzy of some kind?</i>

884
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:15,905
<i>Or had I really come out here to
Las Vegas to work on a story?</i>

885
00:42:21,952 --> 00:42:24,643
<i>Who are these people, these faces?</i>

886
00:42:25,736 --> 00:42:27,139
<i>Where do they come from?</i>

887
00:42:28,309 --> 00:42:31,236
<i>They look like caricatures of
used car dealers from Dallas.</i>

888
00:42:31,313 --> 00:42:32,717
<i>And, sweet Jesus,</i>

889
00:42:32,796 --> 00:42:35,058
<i>there are a hell of a lot of them

<i>still humping the American Dream,</i>

891
00:42:38,803 --> 00:42:40,675
<i>that vision of the big winner somehow emerging</i>

892

<i>from the last-minute, pre-dawn

893

Twenty.
We change a 20.

894
00:42:47,306 --> 00:42:48,594
Thank you.

895
00:42:49,569 --> 00:42:51,168
Here we go.
Okay.

896
00:42:51,247 --> 00:42:53,821

00:42:58,697 --> 00:43:00,179
Oh, you bastard!

900
00:43:01,155 --> 00:43:02,169
Shit.
Sorry.

901
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:04,548
<i>No, no.
Calm down.</i>

902
00:43:05,094 --> 00:43:06,499
<i>Learn to enjoy losing.</i>

903
00:43:25,535 --> 00:43:27,719

904
00:43:27,798 --> 00:43:29,084
Don't touch that.
Leave it alone.

905
00:43:29,162 --> 00:43:30,528
Don't fuck with it, man!

Oh, God.

908
00:43:37,471 --> 00:43:38,953
Did you eat all this acid?

909
00:43:39,032 --> 00:43:40,553
That's right. Music!

910
00:43:41,216 --> 00:43:43,127
You better pray to God there's some Thorazine in that bag.

911
00:43:43,205 --> 00:43:44,493
Otherwise, you're in bad fucking trouble.

912
00:43:44,571 --> 00:43:46,521
Music, man, put that tape on!

913
00:43:46,911 --> 00:43:49,251
<i>- What tape?
- Jefferson Airplane. White Rabbit.</i>

914
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:50,773

You're doomed.

916
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,230
I'm leaving here in two hours.

All right, I'll do it!
I'll do it.

920
00:44:00,408 --> 00:44:02,085
I'll do it. Fuck, man.

921
00:44:02,164 --> 00:44:04,114
Just do me one last favor, will you?

922
00:44:04,699 --> 00:44:06,493
Give me two hours.
That's all I ask, man.

923
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:09,185
Two hours to sleep before tomorrow.

924
00:44:09,887 --> 00:44:11,526
This is fixed.

925

00:46:02,387 --> 00:46:03,634
Oh, fuck.

965
00:46:05,702 --> 00:46:08,823
I was beginning to think I was gonna have to go outside

966
00:46:08,901 --> 00:46:11,086
and get one of the goddamn maids to do it.

967
00:46:11,163 --> 00:46:13,504
Oh, no. I'll do it.

968
00:46:13,738 --> 00:46:15,337
Shit. What are friends for?

969
00:46:18,653 --> 00:46:21,032
<i>I think she'll know</i>

970
00:46:21,267 --> 00:46:22,320
You ready?

971
00:46:23,334 --> 00:46:24,816
<i>Where logic</i>

972
00:46:24,894 --> 00:46:25,869
Close your eyes.

973
00:46:25,948 --> 00:46:26,962
<i>And proportion</i>

974
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:27,975
Yeah, good boy.

975
00:46:28,054 --> 00:46:30,550
<i>Have fallen sloppy dead</i>

976
00:46:31,136 --> 00:46:32,813
Rabbit! White Rabbit!

977
00:46:32,891 --> 00:46:35,075
Quiet, goddamn it!
You're wasting my time!

978
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:38,547
Higher, man. Higher.

979
00:46:40,225 --> 00:46:41,200
<i>Remember</i>

980
00:46:41,278 --> 00:46:44,437
Okay, close those peepers.
Ten.

981
00:46:44,632 --> 00:46:46,895
<i>What the dormouse said</i>

982
00:46:47,246 --> 00:46:49,626
Nine. 111!

983
00:46:49,703 --> 00:46:50,679
<i>Feed your head</i>

984
00:46:50,756 --> 00:46:51,926
52!

985
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:53,955
<i>Feed your head</i>

986
00:46:54,034 --> 00:46:55,984
Hey! Hey! Hey!

987
00:47:22,743 --> 00:47:24,810
You bastard!

988
00:47:25,708 --> 00:47:28,127
<i>Mace! Mace, man.
You want this?</i>

989
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:32,418
You'd do that, wouldn't you?

990
00:47:32,495 --> 00:47:33,471
<i>Well, why not?</i>

991
00:47:33,548 --> 00:47:34,875
You fucking bastard!

992
00:47:34,953 --> 00:47:37,800
<i>Hell, just a minute ago you were asking me to kill you.</i>

993
00:47:37,996 --> 00:47:39,322
<i>Now you wanna kill me.</i>

994
00:47:39,712 --> 00:47:42,287
<i>What I should do, goddamn it, is call the fucking police!</i>

995
00:47:42,364 --> 00:47:44,627
Boy, are you upset.

996
00:47:45,953 --> 00:47:48,684
There'd be no point, man, calling the cops.

997
00:47:49,113 --> 00:47:50,907
<i>There's no choice.</i>

998
00:47:51,024 --> 00:47:53,988
<i>I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you
wandering around with a head full of acid</i>

999
00:47:54,067 --> 00:47:56,290
<i>wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife.</i>

1000
00:47:57,266 --> 00:47:59,645
Who said anything about slicing you up, man?

1001
00:48:01,947 --> 00:48:04,872
I just wanted to cut a little "Z" in your forehead.

1002
00:48:06,745 --> 00:48:08,071
<i>Get back in the tub.</i>

1003
00:48:08,538 --> 00:48:10,684
<i>Eat some reds and try to calm down.</i>

1004
00:48:11,035 --> 00:48:13,298
<i>Smoke some grass.
Shoot some fucking smack.</i>

1005
00:48:13,532 --> 00:48:16,301
<i>Shit, man, do whatever you gotta do, but please,</i>

1006
00:48:16,926 --> 00:48:19,851
<i>I need some fucking rest, man.
Please. Please.</i>

1007
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:21,918
<i>Get up, you pig fucker!</i>

1008
00:48:23,127 --> 00:48:25,039
<i>Up! Up!</i>

1009
00:48:25,663 --> 00:48:27,418
Well, I, uh …

1010
00:48:28,667 --> 00:48:29,720
Yeah.

1011
00:48:31,398 --> 00:48:33,348
You need to get to work.

1012
00:48:33,894 --> 00:48:35,688
Goddamn, what a bummer.

1013
00:48:36,273 --> 00:48:38,068
<i>You scurvy shyster bastard.</i>

1014
00:48:38,419 --> 00:48:40,448
<i>I'm a Doctor of Journalism, man.</i>

1015
00:48:40,525 --> 00:48:41,734
<i>Go on.</i>

1016
00:48:42,632 --> 00:48:43,842
Don't let me keep you up.

1017
00:48:43,919 --> 00:48:45,792
<i>Now … Don't let me keep you up.</i>

1018
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:49,419
<i>Get in there and clean your shorts!</i>

1019
00:48:49,497 --> 00:48:52,228
<i>Clean your shorts, goddamn it,
like a big boy. Go on!</i>

1020
00:48:53,242 --> 00:48:54,451
<i>Pig!</i>

1021
00:48:58,157 --> 00:48:59,835
<i>The acid had shifted gears on him.</i>

1022
00:49:00,458 --> 00:49:01,629
<i>The next phase would probably be</i>

1023
00:49:01,707 --> 00:49:03,813
<i>one of those hellishly intense introspective nightmares.</i>

1024
00:49:03,892 --> 00:49:05,256
Must get some peace.

1025
00:49:05,412 --> 00:49:07,987
<i>Four hours or so of catatonic despair.</i>

1026
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,445
Damn drugs.

1027
00:49:12,161 --> 00:49:13,527
Mmm?

1028
00:49:17,935 --> 00:49:20,197
<i>Ignore the nightmare in the bathroom.</i>

1029
00:49:21,367 --> 00:49:23,903
<i>Just another ugly refugee from the love generation.</i>

1030
00:49:25,579 --> 00:49:27,764
<i>My attorney had never been able to accept the notion</i>

1031
00:49:27,843 --> 00:49:30,105
<i>often espoused by former drug abusers</i>

1032
00:49:30,339 --> 00:49:32,484
<i>that you can get a lot higher
without drugs than with them.</i>

1033
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:35,644
<i>And neither have I, for that matter.</i>

1034
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,335
<i>When the truth is found</i>

1035
00:49:38,413 --> 00:49:42,041
<i>To be lies</i>

1036
00:49:42,587 --> 00:49:45,045
<i>And all the joy</i>

1037
00:49:45,123 --> 00:49:48,711
<i>Within you dies</i>

1038
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:51,988
<i>Don't you want somebody to love</i>

1039
00:49:52,066 --> 00:49:55,460
<i>Don't you need somebody to love</i>

1040
00:49:55,538 --> 00:49:58,892
<i>Wouldn't you love somebody to love</i>

1041
00:49:58,971 --> 00:50:03,340
<i>You better find somebody to love</i>

1042
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:05,212
<i>Love</i>

1043
00:50:07,474 --> 00:50:11,142
<i>1965.
The great San Francisco acid wave.</i>

1044
00:50:11,415 --> 00:50:13,599
<i>When the garden flowers</i>

1045
00:50:13,872 --> 00:50:16,252
<i>I recall one night in a place called the Matrix.</i>

1046
00:50:16,759 --> 00:50:17,695
<i>There I was.</i>

1047
00:50:18,358 --> 00:50:20,620
<i>Mother of God. There I am.</i>

1048
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:22,883
<i>Holy fuck.</i>

1049
00:50:23,702 --> 00:50:26,784
<i>Clearly I was a victim of the drug explosion,</i>

1050
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:30,645
<i>a natural street freak just eating whatever came by.</i>

1051
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:35,990
Does anybody want some LSD?

1052
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:40,944
I got all the makings right here!

1053
00:50:41,724 --> 00:50:46,405
All I need is a place to cook.

1054
00:50:50,345 --> 00:50:52,919
<i>I decided to eat only half of the acid at first.</i>

1055
00:50:52,997 --> 00:50:55,767
<i>But I spilled the rest on the
sleeve of my red woolen shirt.</i>

1056
00:51:01,696 --> 00:51:04,699
What's the trouble?

1057
00:51:05,831 --> 00:51:10,473
Well, all this white stuff on my sleeve

1058
00:51:12,697 --> 00:51:15,544
is LSD.

1059
00:51:30,484 --> 00:51:33,683
<i>With a bit of luck, his life was ruined forever.</i>

1060
00:51:34,931 --> 00:51:38,675
<i>Always thinking that just behind some
narrow door in all his favorite bars,</i>

1061
00:51:39,027 --> 00:51:43,903
<i>men in red woolen shirts are getting
incredible kicks from things he'll never know.</i>

1062
00:51:50,417 --> 00:51:52,953
<i>Strange memories on this nervous night in Las Vegas.</i>

1063
00:51:53,889 --> 00:51:56,775
<i>Has it been five years? Six?</i>

1064
00:51:58,258 --> 00:52:03,133
<i>It seems like a lifetime, the kind
of peak that never comes again.</i>

1065
00:52:03,212 --> 00:52:05,435
<i>Love is but a song we're singing</i>

1066
00:52:05,904 --> 00:52:08,087
<i>San Francisco in the middle '60s</i>

1067
00:52:08,283 --> 00:52:10,779
<i>was a very special time and place to be a part of,</i>

1068
00:52:12,145 --> 00:52:13,198
<i>but no explanation.</i>

1069
00:52:13,276 --> 00:52:14,446
<i>We can make the mountains ring</i>

1070
00:52:14,524 --> 00:52:16,396
<i>No mix of words or music or memories</i>

1071
00:52:16,475 --> 00:52:19,361
<i>can touch that sense of knowing
that you were there and alive</i>

1072
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:23,262
<i>in that corner of time in the world, whatever it meant.</i>

1073
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:26,461
<i>Though the bird is on the wing</i>

1074
00:52:27,084 --> 00:52:30,245
<i>And you may not know why</i>

1075
00:52:32,741 --> 00:52:35,589
<i>There was madness in any direction, at any hour.</i>

1076
00:52:35,666 --> 00:52:36,954
<i>Come on people, now</i>

1077
00:52:37,032 --> 00:52:38,397
<i>You could strike sparks anywhere.</i>

1078
00:52:38,475 --> 00:52:39,918
<i>Try to love one another</i>

1079
00:52:39,997 --> 00:52:41,596
<i>There was a fantastic universal sense</i>

1080
00:52:41,674 --> 00:52:43,780
<i>that whatever we were doing was right,</i>

1081
00:52:43,858 --> 00:52:45,301
<i>that we were winning.</i>

1082
00:52:46,355 --> 00:52:48,071
<i>And that, I think, was the handle.</i>

1083
00:52:48,149 --> 00:52:49,982
<i>Some may come and some may go</i>

1084
00:52:50,061 --> 00:52:53,103
<i>That sense of inevitable victory
over the forces of old and evil.</i>

1085
00:52:53,923 --> 00:52:56,965
<i>Not in any mean or military sense, we didn't need that.</i>

1086
00:52:58,525 --> 00:53:00,476
<i>Our energy would simply prevail.</i>

1087
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:03,206
<i>We had all the momentum.</i>

1088
00:53:03,908 --> 00:53:07,185
<i>We were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave.</i>

1089
00:53:09,292 --> 00:53:12,490
<i>So now, less than 5 years later,</i>

1090
00:53:13,543 --> 00:53:16,352
<i>you can go up a steep hill in Las Vegas and look west</i>

1091
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:18,810
<i>and with the right kind of eyes,</i>

1092
00:53:19,511 --> 00:53:21,540
<i>you can almost see
the high-water mark,</i>

1093
00:53:22,437 --> 00:53:26,494
<i>that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.</i>

1094
00:53:26,573 --> 00:53:28,445
<i>Try to love one another right now</i>

1095
00:53:41,942 --> 00:53:44,204
<i>Want some whiskey in your water?
Room service!</i>

1096
00:53:44,282 --> 00:53:45,842
<i>Some sugar in your tea?</i>

1097
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,846
<i>What's all these crazy questions they're asking me?</i>

1098
00:53:48,923 --> 00:53:49,899
Good morning, sir.

1099
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:51,225
<i>This is the craziest party there could ever be</i>

1100
00:53:51,304 --> 00:53:54,112
What do you want, man?
What do you want?

1101
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:55,595
Room service.
Get out.

1102
00:53:56,023 --> 00:53:56,998
<i>Mama told me not to come</i>

1103
00:53:57,076 --> 00:53:59,196
You're not mine. You're in the wrong room.
Get out! Get the fuck out!

1104
00:53:59,222 --> 00:54:01,446
I've got a gun. It's not mine, really.
Get out.

1105
00:54:01,523 --> 00:54:02,616
The … The … The … What?

1106
00:54:02,693 --> 00:54:03,825
The bill.
All right.

1107
00:54:03,903 --> 00:54:06,048
Will you sign for it?
Yeah, I'll get it. Hurry up.

1108
00:54:07,336 --> 00:54:08,935
Don't move, man.
Be very still. There we go.

1109
00:54:11,315 --> 00:54:12,601
Say nothing to no one, man.

1110
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:15,255
<i>Open up the window Let some air into this room</i>

1111
00:54:15,722 --> 00:54:18,024
<i>The decision to flee came suddenly.</i>

1112
00:54:18,921 --> 00:54:19,896
<i>Or maybe not.</i>

1113
00:54:19,974 --> 00:54:21,963
<i>That cigarette you're smoking
about scared me half to death</i>

1114
00:54:22,042 --> 00:54:25,864
<i>Maybe I'd planned it all along,
subconsciously waiting for the right moment.</i>

1115
00:54:26,098 --> 00:54:27,074
<i>Mama told me not to come</i>

1116
00:54:27,152 --> 00:54:28,829
<i>The bill was a factor, I think,</i>

1117
00:54:28,907 --> 00:54:30,078
<i>because I had no money to pay for it.</i>

1118
00:54:30,155 --> 00:54:31,482
<i>Mama told me not to come</i>

1119
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,886
<i>Our room service tabs had been running</i>

1120
00:54:32,964 --> 00:54:35,772
<i>somewhere between 29 and 36 dollars per hour</i>

1121
00:54:35,851 --> 00:54:38,815
<i>for 48 consecutive hours.
Incredible.</i>

1122
00:54:38,893 --> 00:54:39,868
<i>That ain't the way to have fun, son</i>

1123
00:54:39,947 --> 00:54:41,780
<i>How could it happen?</i>

1124
00:54:41,858 --> 00:54:43,964
<i>But by the time I asked this question,</i>

1125
00:54:44,042 --> 00:54:46,149
<i>there was no one around to answer it.</i>

1126
00:54:46,227 --> 00:54:48,840
<i>That rotten attorney of mine,
Dr. Gonzo, was gone.</i>

1127
00:54:49,348 --> 00:54:50,908
<i>He must have sensed trouble.</i>

1128
00:54:51,883 --> 00:54:53,599
Hmm? Oh. A "Z"?

1129
00:54:55,238 --> 00:54:56,291
<i>Panic.</i>

1130
00:54:57,578 --> 00:55:00,972
<i>It crept up my spine like
first-rising vibes of an acid frenzy.</i>

1131
00:55:01,869 --> 00:55:04,288
<i>All these horrible realities began to dawn on me.</i>

1132
00:55:04,365 --> 00:55:05,575
Oh, fuck.

1133
00:55:07,954 --> 00:55:10,685
<i>Here I was, alone in Las Vegas,</i>

1134
00:55:11,153 --> 00:55:12,674
<i>completely twisted on drugs.</i>

1135
00:55:12,753 --> 00:55:15,600
<i>No cash, no story for the magazine,</i>

1136
00:55:15,756 --> 00:55:20,124
<i>and on top of everything else I had a
gigantic goddamn hotel bill to deal with.</i>

1137
00:55:22,699 --> 00:55:25,937
<i>I didn't even know who'd won the race.
Maybe nobody.</i>

1138
00:55:27,029 --> 00:55:29,096
<i>How would Horatio Alger have handled this situation?</i>

1139
00:55:30,735 --> 00:55:32,997
<i>Stay calm. Stay calm.</i>

1140
00:55:34,012 --> 00:55:35,962
<i>I'm a relatively respectable citizen.</i>

1141
00:55:36,313 --> 00:55:39,434
<i>Multiple felon, perhaps, but certainly not dangerous.</i>

1142
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:41,189
Taxi!

1143
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:43,412
<i>Luckily, I had taken the soap and grapefruit</i>

1144
00:55:43,491 --> 00:55:46,066
<i>and other luggage out to the car a few hours earlier.</i>

1145
00:55:46,143 --> 00:55:49,186
<i>Now, it was only a matter of slipping the noose.</i>

1146
00:55:49,264 --> 00:55:51,137
Hey! Here, take this.
All right.

1147
00:55:53,672 --> 00:55:55,349
Mr. Duke! Mr. Duke!

1148
00:55:55,428 --> 00:55:57,144
Oh, shit.

1149
00:55:57,885 --> 00:55:59,094
We've been looking for you.

1150
00:55:59,172 --> 00:56:01,317
<i>The game was up.
They had me.</i>

1151
00:56:01,981 --> 00:56:04,243
Many fine books have been written in prison, huh?

1152
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:06,583
Sir?
What?

1153
00:56:07,832 --> 00:56:09,119
This telegram came for you.

1154
00:56:09,197 --> 00:56:11,967
Actually, it's not for you.
It's for somebody named Thompson.

1155
00:56:12,044 --> 00:56:13,410
But it says,
"Care of Raoul Duke."

1156
00:56:13,488 --> 00:56:15,751
Do you … Do you … Does that mean anything?

1157
00:56:15,828 --> 00:56:17,232
Yes, yes, it means a lot.
Thanks.

1158
00:56:18,286 --> 00:56:20,393
Yeah, I checked the register for this man Thompson.

1159
00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:22,459
We don't show him, but I figured
he might be part of your team.

1160
00:56:22,538 --> 00:56:23,981
He is. Don't worry.
I'll get it to him.

1161
00:56:24,059 --> 00:56:26,517
Yeah. What confused us was

1162
00:56:26,594 --> 00:56:29,131
Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles

1163
00:56:29,208 --> 00:56:31,548
when we knew he was right here in the hotel.

1164
00:56:31,627 --> 00:56:33,733
Right.
You did the right thing.

1165
00:56:33,889 --> 00:56:35,684
Never try to understand a press message.

1166
00:56:35,762 --> 00:56:38,493
About half the time, we use codes.
Especially with Dr. Gonzo.

1167
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:39,740
See you.
Tell me …

1168
00:56:43,875 --> 00:56:45,514
When will the doctor be awake?

1169
00:56:45,591 --> 00:56:47,074
Awake? What do you mean?

1170
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:51,560
Well, my manager, Mr. Heem,
would like to meet him.

1171
00:56:52,769 --> 00:56:56,826
It's nothing unusual, Mr. Heem likes
to meet all of our large accounts,

1172
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:00,103
put them on a personal basis, you know?

1173
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:01,858
Just a chat and a handshake.

1174
00:57:01,936 --> 00:57:03,224
You understand.

1175
00:57:03,341 --> 00:57:05,291
Of course, but if I were you,

1176
00:57:05,369 --> 00:57:07,163
I would leave the doctor alone until
after he's eaten his breakfast

1177
00:57:07,242 --> 00:57:08,996
because he's a very crude man.

1178
00:57:09,542 --> 00:57:10,713
Jesus God!

1179
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:12,703
No!

1180
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:17,657
But he will be available maybe later this morning?

1181
00:57:18,554 --> 00:57:21,675
Look, the telegram is actually all scrambled.

1182
00:57:22,494 --> 00:57:24,911
It's actually from Thompson, not to him.

1183
00:57:25,107 --> 00:57:28,345
All right? Now, I've got to go.
I've gotta get to the race.

1184
00:57:28,422 --> 00:57:30,139
But there's no hurry.
The race is over.

1185
00:57:30,217 --> 00:57:31,192
Not for me.

1186
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:33,923
Well, let's have lunch!

1187
00:57:34,391 --> 00:57:36,302
Righty-o, man. Righty-o.

1188
00:57:37,394 --> 00:57:40,320
<i>Now, the bricks lay on Grand Street</i>

1189
00:57:40,398 --> 00:57:45,157
<i>Jesus. Bad waves of paranoia.
Madness. Fear and loathing.</i>

1190
00:57:46,054 --> 00:57:48,161
<i>Intolerable vibrations in this place.</i>

1191
00:57:48,629 --> 00:57:53,466
<i>Get out. The weasels were closing in.
I could smell the ugly brutes.</i>

1192
00:57:54,558 --> 00:57:56,235
<i>Do me one last favor, Lord.</i>

1193
00:57:56,314 --> 00:57:57,757
<i>Just give me five more
high-speed hours</i>

1194
00:57:57,835 --> 00:57:59,473
<i>before You bring the hammer down.</i>

1195
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:02,321
<i>Just let me get rid of this goddamn
car and off this horrible desert.</i>

1196
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,416
<i>Oh, Mama</i>

1197
00:58:07,353 --> 00:58:10,084
<i>Is this really the end?</i>

1198
00:58:10,161 --> 00:58:11,331
<i>To be stuck inside of Mobile</i>

1199
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:12,424
Oh, you evil bastard.

1200
00:58:12,502 --> 00:58:13,516
<i>With the Memphis blues again</i>

1201
00:58:13,594 --> 00:58:15,388
This is Your work.
You better take care of me, Lord.

1202
00:58:15,505 --> 00:58:18,431
If You don't, You're gonna have me on Your hands.

1203
00:58:27,481 --> 00:58:28,651
Pull over!

1204
00:58:28,729 --> 00:58:29,704
Hey!
Pull over!

1205
00:58:29,782 --> 00:58:30,797
Good morning. How are you?

1206
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:32,708
All right, man.
Doing very well.

1207
00:58:35,244 --> 00:58:38,364
<i>Few people understand the psychology
of dealing with a highway traffic cop.</i>

1208
00:58:38,443 --> 00:58:41,329
<i>Your normal speeder will panic and
immediately pull over to the side.</i>

1209
00:58:41,875 --> 00:58:45,269
<i>This is wrong. It arouses
contempt in the cop heart.</i>

1210
00:58:46,049 --> 00:58:49,014
<i>Make the bastard chase you.
He will follow.</i>

1211
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:50,745
<i>But he won't know what to make of your blinker signal</i>

1212
00:58:50,768 --> 00:58:52,446
<i>that says you're about to turn right.</i>

1213
00:58:53,032 --> 00:58:55,879
<i>This is to let him know you're pulling
off for a proper place to talk.</i>

1214
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:58,610
<i>It'll take him a moment to realize</i>

1215
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:01,028
<i>that he's about to make
a 180-degree turn, at speed.</i>

1216
00:59:01,535 --> 00:59:05,397
<i>But you will be ready for him.
Brace for the "G" s. Fast heel-toe work.</i>

1217
00:59:05,747 --> 00:59:07,269
Shit! Shit!

1218
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,557
Hi. How are you?

1219
00:59:22,638 --> 00:59:24,979
Just what in the hell did you think you were doing?

1220
00:59:25,369 --> 00:59:28,099
I wanna know.
Let me see your license.

1221
00:59:28,724 --> 00:59:30,870
Oh, yeah, of course.
There you are.

1222
00:59:34,575 --> 00:59:35,824
Oh, my gosh.

1223
00:59:40,543 --> 00:59:41,675
It's me.

1224
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:44,873
May I please have that?

1225
00:59:45,887 --> 00:59:47,526
<i>I knew I was fucked.</i>

1226
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:57,590
See you have two cases of beer, a basket of grapefruit,

1227
00:59:57,668 --> 00:59:59,696
stack of T-shirts and towels,
light bulbs.

1228
01:00:01,529 --> 01:00:03,207
You realize what you did when you drive like that?

1229
01:00:03,285 --> 01:00:05,586
Yeah, I know. I'm guilty.
I understand that.

1230
01:00:05,937 --> 01:00:07,576
I knew it was a crime.
I did it anyway.

1231
01:00:08,239 --> 01:00:09,721
Shit, why argue?
I'm a fucking criminal.

1232
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,126
Look at me.

1233
01:00:11,594 --> 01:00:13,115
You have a strange attitude.

1234
01:00:13,427 --> 01:00:14,558
Maybe.

1235
01:00:15,299 --> 01:00:19,044
You know, I have a feeling you need to take a nap.

1236
01:00:19,669 --> 01:00:21,697
There's a rest area just up ahead.

1237
01:00:21,775 --> 01:00:24,817
I'd like you to go up there, pull
over and get a few hours' sleep.

1238
01:00:24,934 --> 01:00:26,143
That's not gonna help me.

1239
01:00:26,846 --> 01:00:29,811
I've been awake for too long, three or four nights, maybe.
Can't even remember.

1240
01:00:29,888 --> 01:00:32,463
I go to sleep now, I'm dead for 20 hours.

1241
01:00:33,945 --> 01:00:36,676
What are you carrying two cases of soap for, son?

1242
01:00:37,066 --> 01:00:38,860
I wanna stay clean.

1243
01:00:39,992 --> 01:00:41,045
No.

1244
01:00:42,527 --> 01:00:43,776
Here's how it is.

1245
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:46,584
What I put in my book, as of noon,

1246
01:00:46,662 --> 01:00:49,704
is that I apprehended you for driving too fast.

1247
01:00:50,407 --> 01:00:53,449
I advised you to proceed to the next rest area … Stop!

1248
01:00:57,740 --> 01:01:02,890
I advised you to proceed to the next rest
area, your stated destination, right?

1249
01:01:04,879 --> 01:01:06,439
And take a long nap.

1250
01:01:08,195 --> 01:01:09,755
Do I make myself clear?

1251
01:01:10,574 --> 01:01:13,188
Well, how far is Baker?

1252
01:01:13,578 --> 01:01:16,893
I was sort of hoping to, I don't
know, stop there for lunch.

1253
01:01:17,986 --> 01:01:19,429
It's not my jurisdiction.

1254
01:01:19,858 --> 01:01:22,627
City limits end 2.2 miles
beyond the rest area.

1255
01:01:23,524 --> 01:01:24,968
Can you make it that far?

1256
01:01:25,319 --> 01:01:26,450
I'll try.

1257
01:01:27,308 --> 01:01:30,741
- I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time.
- Yeah. Heard a lot about it.

1258
01:01:33,043 --> 01:01:34,486
Excellent seafood.

1259
01:01:36,593 --> 01:01:41,078
You know, I'm thinking, a guy with your
kind of mind ought to try the land-crab.

1260
01:01:42,521 --> 01:01:43,809
Excellent seafood.

1261
01:01:43,887 --> 01:01:45,213
Land-crab.

1262
01:01:45,682 --> 01:01:47,749
All right. Why not?

1263
01:01:48,763 --> 01:01:50,440
Thanks for the tip.

1264
01:01:51,026 --> 01:01:52,703
Look at me in the eyes.

1265
01:01:56,097 --> 01:01:57,462
Everything all right?

1266
01:02:00,934 --> 01:02:03,274
May I have a little kiss before you go?

1267
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:06,122
I'm very lonely here.

1268
01:02:07,838 --> 01:02:10,686
<i>Oh, Mama</i>

1269
01:02:10,763 --> 01:02:13,651
<i>Can this really be the end?</i>

1270
01:02:13,884 --> 01:02:17,317
<i>I felt raped.
The pig had done me on all fronts.</i>

1271
01:02:17,551 --> 01:02:20,672
<i>And now he was going off to chuckle
about it on the west side of town,</i>

1272
01:02:20,749 --> 01:02:22,622
<i>waiting for me
to make a run for L.A.</i>

1273
01:02:23,987 --> 01:02:25,002
<i>Why, yes, Officer.</i>

1274
01:02:25,079 --> 01:02:26,952
<i>Of course I'll take advantage of that rest area.</i>

1275
01:02:27,029 --> 01:02:30,190
<i>And I can't tell you how grateful I
am for this break you wanna give me.</i>

1276
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,608
<i>Get a grip, man.</i>

1277
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:36,665
<i>If I boom straight for L.A.
he'll bust me for sure.</i>

1278
01:02:37,757 --> 01:02:38,889
No.

1279
01:02:39,473 --> 01:02:41,190
<i>This was not the time for a showdown.</i>

1280
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:44,779
<i>This was Death Valley.</i>

1281
01:02:47,548 --> 01:02:49,304
Oh, fuck!

1282
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:53,205
Sweet Jesus, it's him.
Oh, my God!

1283
01:02:59,212 --> 01:03:02,177
Shit! Come on,
you fucking bastard.

1284
01:03:02,254 --> 01:03:05,648
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
I've got to go. I've got to …

1285
01:03:08,457 --> 01:03:10,094
Well, they've nailed me, goddamn it.

1286
01:03:10,173 --> 01:03:12,475
I'm trapped in some stinking
desert crossroads called Baker.

1287
01:03:12,552 --> 01:03:14,268
I don't have much time, man.
The fuckers are closing in.

1288
01:03:14,308 --> 01:03:16,219
They'll hunt me down like a fucking beast.

1289
01:03:16,336 --> 01:03:17,936
<i>You sound a little paranoid.</i>

1290
01:03:18,013 --> 01:03:20,120
I need a fucking lawyer immediately!

1291
01:03:20,198 --> 01:03:22,773
<i>What are you doing in Baker?
Didn't you get my telegram?</i>

1292
01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:24,879
What telegram, you worthless bastard?

1293
01:03:25,776 --> 01:03:27,258
I'll cripple your ass for this.

1294
01:03:27,337 --> 01:03:30,223
You brainless scumbag, you're supposed to be in Vegas.

1295
01:03:30,301 --> 01:03:32,329
I rented a suite at the Flamingo.

1296
01:03:32,563 --> 01:03:36,074
<i>You're supposed to be covering the
National District Attorney's conference.</i>

1297
01:03:36,503 --> 01:03:39,156
<i>I made all the reservations.
Everything is arranged.</i>

1298
01:03:39,975 --> 01:03:43,447
Now, what the fuck are you doing out
there in the middle of the desert?

1299
01:03:43,876 --> 01:03:46,489
Nothing. Never mind.
It's all a big joke.

1300
01:03:46,879 --> 01:03:50,117
I'm actually … I'm poolside at the Flamingo right now,

1301
01:03:50,196 --> 01:03:52,769
talking through a portable phone some
dwarf brought out from the casino.

1302
01:03:52,848 --> 01:03:54,447
Yeah, I have total credit here.

1303
01:03:54,525 --> 01:03:56,866
Don't come anywhere near this place, you bastard.

1304
01:03:56,944 --> 01:03:57,997
Foreigners aren't welcome here.

1305
01:04:00,104 --> 01:04:02,834
<i>Well, this is how the world works.</i>

1306
01:04:03,575 --> 01:04:06,305
<i>All energy flows according to
the whims of the Great Magnet.</i>

1307
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:09,621
<i>What a fool I was to defy him.</i>

1308
01:04:10,323 --> 01:04:13,405
<i>I was going back to Vegas.
I had no choice.</i>

1309
01:04:16,370 --> 01:04:18,203
<i>I had to get rid of the Shark.</i>

1310
01:04:18,359 --> 01:04:22,026
<i>Too many people might recognize
it, especially the Vegas police.</i>

1311
01:04:23,626 --> 01:04:25,966
<i>Luckily, my credit card was still technically valid.</i>

1312
01:04:27,292 --> 01:04:29,750
<i>Now this was a superior machine.</i>

1313
01:04:30,413 --> 01:04:33,455
<i>Ten grand worth of gimmicks and
high-priced special effects.</i>

1314
01:04:34,118 --> 01:04:37,395
<i>The rear windows leapt up with a
touch like frogs in a dynamite pond.</i>

1315
01:04:38,097 --> 01:04:40,711
<i>The dashboard was full of esoteric
lights and dials and meters</i>

1316
01:04:40,789 --> 01:04:42,739
<i>that I would never understand.</i>

1317
01:04:43,676 --> 01:04:45,782
<i>If the pigs were gathering in Vegas,</i>

1318
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:48,357
<i>I felt the drug culture should be represented as well.</i>

1319
01:04:48,941 --> 01:04:51,595
<i>And there was a certain bent appeal in
the notion of running a savage burn</i>

1320
01:04:51,672 --> 01:04:53,349
<i>on one Las Vegas hotel,</i>

1321
01:04:53,428 --> 01:04:56,314
<i>and then just wheeling across
town and checking into another.</i>

1322
01:04:56,782 --> 01:04:59,629
<i>Me and 1,000 ranking cops from all over America.</i>

1323
01:04:59,942 --> 01:05:02,790
<i>Why not move confidently into their midst?</i>

1324
01:05:02,867 --> 01:05:04,818
Welcome to the Flamingo Hotel, sir.

1325
01:05:08,173 --> 01:05:10,474
Sir?
Yeah, hi. Right. Okay.

1326
01:05:10,669 --> 01:05:12,619
<i>Let me stay in your arms</i>

1327
01:05:12,698 --> 01:05:15,155
<i>I'm addicted to your charms</i>

1328
01:05:15,233 --> 01:05:18,081
<i>You're getting to be a habit with me</i>

1329
01:05:19,953 --> 01:05:23,190
<i>I used to think your love was something that I</i>

1330
01:05:23,269 --> 01:05:24,595
<i>Could take</i>

1331
01:05:24,673 --> 01:05:25,726
<i>Or leave alone</i>

1332
01:05:25,804 --> 01:05:28,223
<i>My arrival was badly timed.</i>

1333
01:05:28,301 --> 01:05:31,812
<i>But now I couldn't do without my supply</i>

1334
01:05:31,889 --> 01:05:34,815
<i>I need you for my own</i>

1335
01:05:41,407 --> 01:05:42,967
This here model is one that we had to use

1336
01:05:43,046 --> 01:05:46,128
when we took on them little
peckerheads down there at Kent State.

1337
01:05:46,947 --> 01:05:48,546
And this baby here …

1338
01:05:51,238 --> 01:05:53,657
I'm a police chief from Michigan.

1339
01:05:53,734 --> 01:05:55,490
Look, fella, I have explained to you.

1340
01:05:55,567 --> 01:06:00,638
I have this postcard which says that
I have a reservation in this hotel.

1341
01:06:00,794 --> 01:06:04,266
I'm very sorry, sir, but you're on the late list.

1342
01:06:04,345 --> 01:06:07,972
- And so, your reservation has been transferred to...
- It's okay.

1343
01:06:08,713 --> 01:06:14,291
… the Moonlight Motel which is
just out on Paradise Boulevard.

1344
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:16,437
We've already paid for our goddamn room!

1345
01:06:16,515 --> 01:06:18,621
Well, it's actually a very fine place of lodging,

1346
01:06:18,699 --> 01:06:22,679
and it's only 16 blocks from here.
It has a pool, sauna, steam.

1347
01:06:22,756 --> 01:06:24,512
You listen to me, you filthy little faggot!

1348
01:06:24,589 --> 01:06:27,047
I want a manager down here, now, now!

1349
01:06:27,125 --> 01:06:29,739
Now, because I'm sick of listening to your dog shit!

1350
01:06:29,816 --> 01:06:32,898
I am very sorry, sir.

1351
01:06:32,977 --> 01:06:34,537
Get off of me!
Get away from me!

1352
01:06:34,614 --> 01:06:35,667
Can I call you a cab?

1353
01:06:35,746 --> 01:06:37,579
Sure, and I'll call you a cocksucker!

1354
01:06:37,658 --> 01:06:40,583
<i>Of course, I could hear what the clerk was really saying.</i>

1355
01:06:40,817 --> 01:06:43,392
Listen, you fuzzy little shithead!

1356
01:06:44,132 --> 01:06:46,317
I've been fucked around in my time

1357
01:06:46,395 --> 01:06:48,463
by a fairly good cross section

1358
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:51,466
of mean-tempered,
rule-crazy cops.

1359
01:06:51,544 --> 01:06:54,587
And now, it's my turn.

1360
01:06:56,342 --> 01:07:00,165
So fuck you, Officer.
I'm in charge.

1361
01:07:00,399 --> 01:07:02,506
Hey, listen, I really hate to interrupt,

1362
01:07:02,553 --> 01:07:04,705
but I wonder if I could just slide
on through and get out of your way.

1363
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:06,211
The name is Duke. Raoul Duke.

1364
01:07:06,289 --> 01:07:08,434
I think my attorney made the reservations.

1365
01:07:08,513 --> 01:07:09,722
Duke, Raoul.

1366
01:07:10,034 --> 01:07:11,438
Certainly, sir.

1367
01:07:11,555 --> 01:07:15,222
My bags … My bags are out there in
that white Cadillac convertible there.

1368
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:17,056
Maybe somebody could bring it to the room for me.

1369
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:21,424
Well, let me get a quart of Wild Turkey,

1370
01:07:21,736 --> 01:07:25,052
two-fifths of Bacardi, some ice
for the room, and let's see …

1371
01:07:25,131 --> 01:07:26,144
You just calm down!

1372
01:07:26,222 --> 01:07:27,939
Shit, let's try some lime chunks.
What do you think?

1373
01:07:28,524 --> 01:07:29,694
I say okay.

1374
01:07:31,372 --> 01:07:32,775
You don't worry about a thing.

1375
01:07:32,854 --> 01:07:33,829
Now, calm down.

1376
01:07:33,907 --> 01:07:37,028
You don't hesitate to call me, Sven.

1377
01:07:37,846 --> 01:07:38,978
All right, Sven.

1378
01:07:40,265 --> 01:07:41,319
Thank you very much.

1379
01:07:41,397 --> 01:07:42,684
You … You …

1380
01:07:42,762 --> 01:07:44,908
I know, I know, I know.
It's hideous.

1381
01:07:44,985 --> 01:07:46,741
You're gonna be fine, though.
You're doing well.

1382
01:07:47,716 --> 01:07:49,472
I'll see you later. Wait.
Don't touch it.

1383
01:07:49,549 --> 01:07:51,851
Good night. Pardon me.
Bye, Sven.

1384
01:07:53,762 --> 01:07:56,843
Look what you did!
Look what you did!

1385
01:07:56,922 --> 01:08:00,394
Goddamn you, we wouldn't stay
in this hotel if you begged us!

1386
01:08:00,471 --> 01:08:03,865
<i>Magic moments</i>

1387
01:08:04,528 --> 01:08:08,390
<i>When two hearts are caring</i>

1388
01:08:08,897 --> 01:08:13,071
<i>Magic moments</i>

1389
01:08:13,344 --> 01:08:15,997
<i>Memories we've been sharing</i>

1390
01:08:16,309 --> 01:08:18,922
Home, sweet home. Whoa.
What kind of sick shit …

1391
01:08:19,039 --> 01:08:20,639
Oh, shit!

1392
01:08:22,512 --> 01:08:24,149
Shit. What the fuck?

1393
01:08:24,578 --> 01:08:26,022
Stop, stop, stop.

1394
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:27,777
She's biting my leg off!

1395
01:08:27,856 --> 01:08:30,352
You degenerate pig. Please!

1396
01:08:30,429 --> 01:08:31,639
Can't be helped.

1397
01:08:31,717 --> 01:08:32,654
My fucking leg!

1398
01:08:32,731 --> 01:08:35,072
That's "Lucy In The Sky
With Diamonds."

1399
01:08:35,813 --> 01:08:37,763
Lucy, be cool, goddamn it.

1400
01:08:38,855 --> 01:08:41,625
Remember what happened at the airport, okay?
Come on.

1401
01:08:45,331 --> 01:08:48,569
No more of that, okay?
That's my client, Lucy.

1402
01:08:49,076 --> 01:08:51,845
That's Mr. Duke,
the famous journalist.

1403
01:08:52,625 --> 01:08:54,420
He's paying for this suite, Lucy.

1404
01:08:55,317 --> 01:08:56,643
He's on our side.

1405
01:08:57,541 --> 01:08:59,374
He loves artists.

1406
01:09:00,232 --> 01:09:02,885
Lucy paints portraits of Barbra Streisand.

1407
01:09:05,264 --> 01:09:06,434
Right?

1408
01:09:07,604 --> 01:09:09,399
I drew these from TV.

1409
01:09:10,101 --> 01:09:11,349
Really.

1410
01:09:11,895 --> 01:09:14,353
She came all the way down …

1411
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:17,201
- What's the name of that town?
- Montana.

1412
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:20,867
Montana.
Just to give these portraits to Barbra.

1413
01:09:22,350 --> 01:09:25,744
We're going over to the Americana
tonight to meet her backstage.

1414
01:09:25,938 --> 01:09:30,425
<i>I desperately needed peace, rest, sanctuary.</i>

1415
01:09:31,478 --> 01:09:34,169
<i>I hadn't counted on this, finding my attorney on acid</i>

1416
01:09:34,247 --> 01:09:36,743
<i>and locked into some kind of preternatural courtship.</i>

1417
01:09:37,016 --> 01:09:38,031
Well.

1418
01:09:39,357 --> 01:09:42,946
They must have brought the car around by now.

1419
01:09:43,531 --> 01:09:46,496
So why don't

1420
01:09:47,861 --> 01:09:50,904
ou-yay and I-ay

1421
01:09:52,113 --> 01:09:54,141
o-gay and et-gay the

1422
01:09:55,702 --> 01:09:59,057
uff-stay out of the unk-tray.

1423
01:10:04,947 --> 01:10:06,780
Absolutely. Yeah.

1424
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:08,613
Let's get the stuff.

1425
01:10:09,589 --> 01:10:11,071
We'll be right back, Lucy.

1426
01:10:12,436 --> 01:10:14,230
- Give me a kiss? One kiss, one kiss.
- No.

1427
01:10:14,464 --> 01:10:15,635
- No.
- One kiss.

1428
01:10:15,713 --> 01:10:16,766
No.
Why not?

1429
01:10:16,844 --> 01:10:18,677
No.
Okay.

1430
01:10:24,685 --> 01:10:26,011
Don't answer the phone.

1431
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:34,787
God bless.

1432
01:10:37,714 --> 01:10:39,937
Well, what are your plans?

1433
01:10:40,795 --> 01:10:41,926
Plans?

1434
01:10:42,199 --> 01:10:43,759
The child in the bedroom.

1435
01:10:44,111 --> 01:10:47,153
Oh, Lucy.
I met her on the plane.

1436
01:10:49,766 --> 01:10:52,224
Yeah.
She's a religious freak.

1437
01:10:53,277 --> 01:10:55,735
I gave her a cap before I realized …

1438
01:10:55,813 --> 01:10:57,725
Jesus, she's never even had a drink.

1439
01:10:59,128 --> 01:11:00,533
Well, it'll probably work out.

1440
01:11:00,611 --> 01:11:03,302
We can keep her loaded, and then
peddle her ass at the drug convention.

1441
01:11:03,381 --> 01:11:05,370
Yeah, she's perfect for this gig.

1442
01:11:06,423 --> 01:11:07,476
These cops'll go 50 bucks a head

1443
01:11:07,554 --> 01:11:09,778
to beat her into submission
and then gang-fuck her.

1444
01:11:10,363 --> 01:11:12,391
We can set her up in one of these backstreet motels,

1445
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:14,498
hang pictures of Jesus all over the room,

1446
01:11:14,576 --> 01:11:16,644
and then turn these fucking pigs loose on her.

1447
01:11:16,722 --> 01:11:18,828
Hell, she's strong, man.
She'll hold her own.

1448
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:22,963
Jesus Christ, I knew you were sick,

1449
01:11:23,041 --> 01:11:26,630
but I never expected to hear you
actually say that kind of stuff.

1450
01:11:26,707 --> 01:11:27,722
You filthy bastard.

1451
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:30,881
Straight economics, man.
This girl's a godsend.

1452
01:11:31,544 --> 01:11:33,456
Shit. She could make us
a grand a day.

1453
01:11:33,534 --> 01:11:36,421
That's ugly, man.
Stop talking like that.

1454
01:11:37,395 --> 01:11:39,503
Well, I figure she can do about four at a time.

1455
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:43,637
If we keep her full of acid, that's
more like two grand a day, maybe three.

1456
01:11:47,031 --> 01:11:48,318
Hold on, man.

1457
01:11:48,396 --> 01:11:51,165
What if I just jump on you and
beat the dog shit out of you?

1458
01:11:51,283 --> 01:11:53,623
Would that make you feel any better, you filthy bastard?

1459
01:11:53,701 --> 01:11:55,066
All right, listen to me.

1460
01:11:55,846 --> 01:11:58,304
In a few hours, she'll probably
be sane enough to work herself

1461
01:11:58,382 --> 01:12:00,177
into some sort of towering
Jesus-based rage

1462
01:12:00,254 --> 01:12:04,818
at the hazy recollection of being
seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan

1463
01:12:05,326 --> 01:12:06,691
who fed her liquor and LSD,

1464
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:08,875
dragged her to a Vegas hotel room

1465
01:12:08,953 --> 01:12:12,464
and then savagely penetrated
every orifice in her little body

1466
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:15,389
with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.

1467
01:12:15,858 --> 01:12:17,652
That's so ugly, man.

1468
01:12:17,730 --> 01:12:19,564
Well, fuck, truth hurts.
That's "Argh!"

1469
01:12:19,641 --> 01:12:20,617
Yeah.
Argh!

1470
01:12:20,695 --> 01:12:22,723
That's argh! Argh!

1471
01:12:23,075 --> 01:12:24,868
That's argh!
Argh?

1472
01:12:25,961 --> 01:12:27,522
I wanted to help her, man.

1473
01:12:28,731 --> 01:12:32,241
Well, you'll go straight to the gas chamber for this one.

1474
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:35,635
Even if you manage to beat that,
they'll still send you back to Nevada

1475
01:12:35,713 --> 01:12:37,702
for rape and consensual sodomy.

1476
01:12:38,210 --> 01:12:40,160
No, she's gotta go.

1477
01:12:41,018 --> 01:12:42,110
Shit.

1478
01:12:43,475 --> 01:12:45,699
It doesn't pay to try to help somebody these days, huh?

1479
01:12:51,317 --> 01:12:52,408
Let's go.

1480
01:12:53,267 --> 01:12:56,153
Yeah. Americana Hotel?
I need a reservation.

1481
01:12:56,582 --> 01:12:58,104
For my niece.

1482
01:12:59,079 --> 01:13:01,732
Look, I want her treated very gently.
She's an artist and …

1483
01:13:02,043 --> 01:13:03,252
Fuck off.

1484
01:13:03,331 --> 01:13:04,969
She might seem
a trifle high-strung.

1485
01:13:05,554 --> 01:13:09,806
She's doing her Masters' thesis
on, well, Barbra Streisand.

1486
01:13:09,884 --> 01:13:10,977
It's time to meet Barbra.

1487
01:13:11,054 --> 01:13:12,147
Last name?

1488
01:13:12,966 --> 01:13:15,228
I'd rather not say.
My brother's in politics.

1489
01:13:15,579 --> 01:13:16,905
Yeah, you understand.

1490
01:13:17,451 --> 01:13:19,909
<i>I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done.</i>

1491
01:13:21,079 --> 01:13:23,186
Yeah, yeah, righto.
Okay, yeah. Bye.

1492
01:13:29,934 --> 01:13:32,743
<i>Yummy, yummy, yummy I've got love in my tummy</i>

1493
01:13:32,821 --> 01:13:35,005
<i>And I feel like loving you</i>

1494
01:13:36,838 --> 01:13:39,647
<i>Love is such a sweet thing Good enough to eat</i>

1495
01:13:39,726 --> 01:13:42,183
<i>And it's just what I'm gonna do</i>

1496
01:13:42,261 --> 01:13:44,680
<i>Lucy was a potentially fatal millstone on both our necks.</i>

1497
01:13:44,757 --> 01:13:45,810
Hurry the fuck up!

1498
01:13:45,889 --> 01:13:48,541
<i>There was absolutely no choice but to cut her adrift …</i>

1499
01:13:48,619 --> 01:13:49,594
Jesus Christ. Take your time!

1500
01:13:49,672 --> 01:13:51,388
<i>… and hope her memory was fucked.</i>

1501
01:13:51,467 --> 01:13:53,027
Here's an extra 10 bucks, buddy.

1502
01:13:53,105 --> 01:13:54,549
Make sure she gets there safely.

1503
01:13:59,659 --> 01:14:00,868
That's that.

1504
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:05,354
Hey, man, take off slowly.
Don't attract attention.

1505
01:14:07,421 --> 01:14:11,361
<i>Yummy, yummy, yummy I've got love in my tummy</i>

1506
01:14:11,556 --> 01:14:13,702
Let's find a good seafood
restaurant and eat some red salmon.

1507
01:14:13,779 --> 01:14:16,393
I feel a powerful lust for red salmon.

1508
01:14:27,862 --> 01:14:30,826
Oh, no, man.
We're gonna be late. We gotta go.

1509
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:34,844
Goddamn mescaline.

1510
01:14:37,418 --> 01:14:40,149
Why the fuck can't they make it a little less pure?

1511
01:14:41,319 --> 01:14:46,079
<i>I welcome you to the third
National D.A.'s Convention</i>

1512
01:14:46,273 --> 01:14:48,536
<i>on Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs.</i>

1513
01:14:49,628 --> 01:14:51,813
<i>And now, without further ado,</i>

1514
01:14:51,890 --> 01:14:55,674
<i>the man who will define this cancer
eating at the heart of America.</i>

1515
01:14:56,181 --> 01:14:58,444
<i>Dr. L. Ron Bumquist.</i>

1516
01:15:05,816 --> 01:15:08,352
I saw these bastards in Easy Rider,
but I didn't believe they were real.

1517
01:15:08,429 --> 01:15:10,887
Not like this, man, not hundreds of them.

1518
01:15:11,746 --> 01:15:13,930
They're actually pretty nice
people once you get to know them.

1519
01:15:14,008 --> 01:15:16,778
Know them?
I know these people in my goddamn blood.

1520
01:15:16,855 --> 01:15:19,547
Don't say that word around here.
You'll get them excited.

1521
01:15:19,625 --> 01:15:20,639
You're right.

1522
01:15:20,718 --> 01:15:23,487
<i>The most efficient way for us to
do this is for each one of us</i>

1523
01:15:24,111 --> 01:15:28,324
<i>to try and attempt to imagine what it is like</i>

1524
01:15:28,402 --> 01:15:32,303
<i>inside of the possessed mind of the addict.</i>

1525
01:15:32,381 --> 01:15:33,668
Hmm?

1526
01:15:34,058 --> 01:15:37,101
<i>For example, a dope fiend</i>

1527
01:15:38,154 --> 01:15:42,484
<i>refers to the reefer butt as a "roach"</i>

1528
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:47,321
<i>because it resembles a cockroach.</i>

1529
01:15:48,764 --> 01:15:50,481
What the fuck are these people talking about?

1530
01:15:50,558 --> 01:15:53,913
You've got to be crazy on acid to think
a joint looks like a goddamn cockroach.

1531
01:15:54,811 --> 01:15:58,439
<i>… you will notice that I have distinguished four …</i>

1532
01:15:59,375 --> 01:16:04,680
<i>Four distinct states of being in
the cannabis or marijuana society.</i>

1533
01:16:05,694 --> 01:16:09,048
<i>They are cool, groovy,</i>

1534
01:16:09,127 --> 01:16:11,233
<i>hip and square.</i>

1535
01:16:11,389 --> 01:16:13,105
<i>Seldom, if ever …</i>

1536
01:16:13,379 --> 01:16:14,861
Too crazy, man. Too crazy.

1537
01:16:16,460 --> 01:16:18,956
We should get the hell out.
What a fucking nightmare.

1538
01:16:19,035 --> 01:16:21,726
<i>If he figures out what is happening</i>

1539
01:16:21,804 --> 01:16:24,027
<i>then he can rise one notch</i>

1540
01:16:24,106 --> 01:16:26,056
<i>and become hip.</i>

1541
01:16:26,758 --> 01:16:29,528
<i>And then if he can convince himself</i>

1542
01:16:29,605 --> 01:16:33,078
<i>to approve of what is happening,</i>

1543
01:16:33,779 --> 01:16:37,330
<i>then he becomes groovy.</i>

1544
01:16:37,563 --> 01:16:39,397
<i>Groovy.</i>

1545
01:16:40,879 --> 01:16:44,156
<i>And then, after that, he can actually raise himself</i>

1546
01:16:44,234 --> 01:16:46,692
<i>to the rank of cool.</i>

1547
01:16:46,769 --> 01:16:49,500
<i>He can become one of those</i>

1548
01:16:49,617 --> 01:16:51,373
<i>cool guys.</i>

1549
01:16:51,450 --> 01:16:53,401
Dr. Bumquist.

1550
01:16:53,752 --> 01:16:56,950
You think the anthropologist Margaret Mead's

1551
01:16:57,028 --> 01:16:58,900
strange behavior of late

1552
01:16:58,979 --> 01:17:01,865
could be explained by a private marijuana addiction?

1553
01:17:01,944 --> 01:17:02,918
Good question.

1554
01:17:04,167 --> 01:17:06,781
<i>I'm not really sure I can answer that.</i>

1555
01:17:06,859 --> 01:17:11,423
<i>But what I can tell you, sir,
is if Margaret Mead, at her age</i>

1556
01:17:12,086 --> 01:17:14,036
<i>smoked grass,</i>

1557
01:17:15,324 --> 01:17:17,313
<i>she'd have one hell of a trip.</i>

1558
01:17:22,111 --> 01:17:24,763
<i>One more layer of deviance to the woman.</i>

1559
01:17:24,841 --> 01:17:26,636
This is fuckin' bullshit.

1560
01:17:26,831 --> 01:17:28,625
I'll be out in the casino.

1561
01:17:32,292 --> 01:17:34,086
Shut up, man. Go to hell!

1562
01:17:35,139 --> 01:17:37,129
<i>Thank you very much.
Thank you.</i>

1563
01:17:37,363 --> 01:17:39,820
<i>Thank you. Thank you for having me. Projector, please.</i>

1564
01:17:40,211 --> 01:17:41,849
Excuse me.
All right.

1565
01:17:47,466 --> 01:17:49,144
<i>Know your dope fiend.</i>

1566
01:17:49,221 --> 01:17:51,523
<i>Your life may depend on it.</i>

1567
01:17:51,757 --> 01:17:55,268
<i>You will not be able to see his
eyes, because of Tea Shades,</i>

1568
01:17:55,345 --> 01:17:58,506
<i>but his knuckles will be white from inner tension.</i>

1569
01:17:58,896 --> 01:18:00,689
<i>And his pants will be crusted with semen</i>

1570
01:18:00,768 --> 01:18:04,200
<i>from constantly jacking off when
he can't find a rape victim.</i>

1571
01:18:05,059 --> 01:18:06,775
<i>He will stagger and babble when questioned.</i>

1572
01:18:07,945 --> 01:18:10,130
<i>He will not respect your badge.</i>

1573
01:18:10,208 --> 01:18:12,432
<i>The dope fiend fears nothing.</i>

1574
01:18:12,509 --> 01:18:16,020
<i>He will attack for no reason,
with any weapon at his command</i>

1575
01:18:16,449 --> 01:18:17,853
<i>including yours.</i>

1576
01:18:18,009 --> 01:18:18,985
Cheers.

1577
01:18:19,063 --> 01:18:21,677
<i>Beware. Any officer
apprehending</i>

1578
01:18:21,754 --> 01:18:23,627
<i>a suspected marijuana addict … Pardon me.</i>

1579
01:18:24,017 --> 01:18:27,138
<i>… should use all necessary force immediately.
Sorry. Pardon me.</i>

1580
01:18:27,215 --> 01:18:31,545
<i>One stitch in time on him will usually save nine</i>

1581
01:18:31,623 --> 01:18:33,379
<i>on you.</i>

1582
01:18:33,456 --> 01:18:34,978
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1583
01:18:35,056 --> 01:18:36,733
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

1584
01:18:37,163 --> 01:18:38,333
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1585
01:18:45,549 --> 01:18:46,525
Yeah?

1586
01:18:46,602 --> 01:18:49,255
Yes, Mr. Duke, hello.
You have one message.

1587
01:18:49,450 --> 01:18:50,581
Call Lucy …

1588
01:18:51,752 --> 01:18:53,507
<i>… at the Americana Hotel, room 1600.</i>

1589
01:18:53,585 --> 01:18:54,989
Oh, fuck.

1590
01:18:55,107 --> 01:18:56,433
Hello?

1591
01:18:56,706 --> 01:18:57,720
Lucy called.

1592
01:18:59,943 --> 01:19:02,323
What?
Lucy called.

1593
01:19:02,634 --> 01:19:04,195
What?
Lucy called, man.

1594
01:19:17,146 --> 01:19:20,345
<i>Those two men in the dock, they gave me the LSD</i>

1595
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:22,607
<i>and they took me to the hotel.</i>

1596
01:19:22,919 --> 01:19:25,728
<i>I don't know what they done to me, but I remember</i>

1597
01:19:25,806 --> 01:19:27,171
<i>it was horrible.</i>

1598
01:19:28,263 --> 01:19:29,784
<i>They gave you what?</i>

1599
01:19:29,863 --> 01:19:31,306
<i>LSD.</i>

1600
01:19:31,735 --> 01:19:33,295
<i>Castration!</i>

1601
01:19:34,894 --> 01:19:36,962
<i>Double castration!</i>

1602
01:19:39,342 --> 01:19:41,370
Where's my .357, man?
Who the fuck knows, man?

1603
01:19:43,047 --> 01:19:44,919
You can't leave me alone in this snake pit.

1604
01:19:45,583 --> 01:19:47,923
You bastard, what did you do
with my .357?

1605
01:19:49,874 --> 01:19:51,317
This room is in my name.

1606
01:19:51,395 --> 01:19:53,189
Well, tough titty.

1607
01:19:53,541 --> 01:19:55,178
Okay, goddamn it!

1608
01:19:57,169 --> 01:19:58,455
You're right.

1609
01:19:58,806 --> 01:20:02,240
She's my problem.
I'll call her, I'll get her off our backs.

1610
01:20:02,317 --> 01:20:03,604
It's gone too fucking far.

1611
01:20:03,683 --> 01:20:05,750
Well, I'll take that into consideration.

1612
01:20:05,828 --> 01:20:07,271
Relax.
Relax!

1613
01:20:07,349 --> 01:20:08,910
Let me handle this.

1614
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:13,435
Where are my shoes?

1615
01:20:13,551 --> 01:20:15,228
The Americana Hotel.
What did you do with my goddamn shoes?

1616
01:20:15,307 --> 01:20:16,829
Room 1600, please.

1617
01:20:16,906 --> 01:20:20,846
As your attorney, I advise you to take
a hit out of the little brown bottle

1618
01:20:20,924 --> 01:20:22,601
in my shaving kit.

1619
01:20:23,303 --> 01:20:24,863
You won't need much.

1620
01:20:26,698 --> 01:20:28,531
Just a tiny taste.

1621
01:20:28,608 --> 01:20:31,729
Let's have it.
Ah, there it is.

1622
01:20:35,825 --> 01:20:37,697
What is this shit?
That stuff

1623
01:20:37,970 --> 01:20:42,378
makes pure mescaline seem like ginger beer, man.

1624
01:20:43,744 --> 01:20:45,343
Adrenochrome.

1625
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:47,059
Adrenochrome? Hmm.

1626
01:20:54,237 --> 01:20:55,290
Hello.

1627
01:20:57,163 --> 01:20:58,801
Hi, Lucy. God bless.

1628
01:20:59,308 --> 01:21:00,517
Hmm?

1629
01:21:00,595 --> 01:21:02,194
Yeah, it's me.

1630
01:21:02,273 --> 01:21:05,901
Hell, no, I taught the bastard
a lesson he'll never forget.

1631
01:21:06,212 --> 01:21:09,177
What? No, not dead.

1632
01:21:09,333 --> 01:21:12,336
But he won't be bothering anybody for a while.

1633
01:21:12,415 --> 01:21:14,560
Yeah, I left him out there.

1634
01:21:14,638 --> 01:21:16,316
I stomped him.

1635
01:21:16,862 --> 01:21:18,461
I pulled all his teeth out.

1636
01:21:18,539 --> 01:21:19,982
<i>I remember thinking, "Jesus.</i>

1637
01:21:20,061 --> 01:21:22,479
<i>"What a terrible thing to lay on
somebody with a head full of acid."</i>

1638
01:21:22,557 --> 01:21:24,195
But we have a problem.

1639
01:21:24,273 --> 01:21:26,458
That bastard cashed a bad check downstairs

1640
01:21:26,535 --> 01:21:28,447
and gave you as a reference.

1641
01:21:28,525 --> 01:21:30,749
They'll be looking for both of you.

1642
01:21:31,216 --> 01:21:35,000
Yeah, I know, Lucy, but you can't
judge a book by its cover.

1643
01:21:35,078 --> 01:21:37,809
Some people are just basically rotten.

1644
01:21:39,448 --> 01:21:41,281
Anyway, the last thing in the world you wanna do

1645
01:21:41,358 --> 01:21:43,543
is call this hotel again.

1646
01:21:43,972 --> 01:21:45,845
They'll trace the call, put you straight behind bars.

1647
01:21:47,951 --> 01:21:50,057
No, I'm moving to the Tropicana right away.

1648
01:21:52,242 --> 01:21:53,295
Hmm.

1649
01:21:53,374 --> 01:21:56,260
I'll use a different name.
I'll let you know what it is.

1650
01:22:00,628 --> 01:22:02,073
I gotta get off.

1651
01:22:03,047 --> 01:22:05,817
Probably have this phone tapped, baby.

1652
01:22:06,090 --> 01:22:08,001
Yeah, I know, it was horrible, but it's all over now.

1653
01:22:09,913 --> 01:22:12,409
Oh, my God.
There's someone at the door.

1654
01:22:13,462 --> 01:22:14,750
There's someone at the door.

1655
01:22:17,090 --> 01:22:18,962
Christ! Hey!

1656
01:22:19,587 --> 01:22:22,200
No! I'm innocent!
It was Duke!

1657
01:22:22,279 --> 01:22:25,360
It was Duke! Lucy! Lucy!

1658
01:22:25,438 --> 01:22:27,661
I love you! I love you!

1659
01:22:33,747 --> 01:22:34,995
Don't put that thing on me!

1660
01:22:41,314 --> 01:22:44,513
Whoo. Oh.

1661
01:22:44,630 --> 01:22:46,229
Well …

1662
01:22:47,556 --> 01:22:49,506
That's that.

1663
01:22:50,755 --> 01:22:53,445
That's the last we should be hearing from Lucy, man.

1664
01:22:57,035 --> 01:23:00,701
She's probably stuffing herself
down the incinerator about now.

1665
01:23:04,095 --> 01:23:05,616
You know what we need?

1666
01:23:05,695 --> 01:23:07,177
We need some opium.

1667
01:23:18,372 --> 01:23:20,284
<i>I remember slumping on the bed.</i>

1668
01:23:20,361 --> 01:23:22,624
<i>His performance had given me a bad jolt.</i>

1669
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:25,355
<i>For a moment, I thought his mind had snapped,</i>

1670
01:23:25,432 --> 01:23:28,436
<i>that he actually believed he was
being attacked by invisible enemies.</i>

1671
01:23:28,826 --> 01:23:30,699
<i>But the room was quiet again.</i>

1672
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,794
Where'd you get this?

1673
01:23:34,873 --> 01:23:37,174
Never mind.
It's absolutely pure.

1674
01:23:38,422 --> 01:23:40,763
What kind of monster client have
you hooked up with this time?

1675
01:23:40,841 --> 01:23:42,674
Satanism freak.

1676
01:23:43,025 --> 01:23:44,585
I think there's only one source for this stuff,

1677
01:23:44,664 --> 01:23:47,901
the adrenaline gland

1678
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:51,022
from a living human body.

1679
01:23:51,412 --> 01:23:52,777
I know.

1680
01:23:52,894 --> 01:23:54,962
The guy didn't have any cash to pay me.

1681
01:23:55,547 --> 01:23:59,291
He offered me human blood, said it would take
me higher than I'd ever been in my life.

1682
01:23:59,838 --> 01:24:01,671
- I thought he was kidding.
- Oh.

1683
01:24:01,749 --> 01:24:05,455
So I told him I'd just as soon have
an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome.

1684
01:24:06,430 --> 01:24:09,043
Or maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland

1685
01:24:09,122 --> 01:24:10,487
to chew on.

1686
01:24:10,643 --> 01:24:13,295
<i>I could already feel the stuff working on me.</i>

1687
01:24:13,413 --> 01:24:16,728
<i>The first wave felt like a combination
of mescaline and methedrine.</i>

1688
01:24:17,508 --> 01:24:19,771
<i>Maybe I should take a swim, I thought.</i>

1689
01:24:19,849 --> 01:24:21,566
Yes, sir.

1690
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:27,690
They nailed this guy for child molesting.

1691
01:24:28,392 --> 01:24:30,108
He swore he didn't do it.

1692
01:24:30,186 --> 01:24:33,853
"Why should I fuck with children?" he said.
"They're too small."

1693
01:24:35,023 --> 01:24:36,155
Christ, what could I say?

1694
01:24:36,232 --> 01:24:39,509
Even a goddamn werewolf is entitled to legal counsel.

1695
01:24:40,290 --> 01:24:42,513
I didn't dare to turn the creep down.

1696
01:24:45,087 --> 01:24:48,013
He might have picked up a letter opener and gone after my

1697
01:24:48,988 --> 01:24:50,002
pineal gland.

1698
01:24:51,445 --> 01:24:53,162
You know?
Yeah.

1699
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:55,190
Crazy.
Why not?

1700
01:24:55,580 --> 01:24:58,272
Shit. We should get
some of that.

1701
01:24:58,779 --> 01:25:00,183
Just

1702
01:25:00,261 --> 01:25:01,783
eat a big handful and see what happens.

1703
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:04,318
Some of what?

1704
01:25:08,336 --> 01:25:10,130
Extract of pineal.

1705
01:25:10,209 --> 01:25:12,120
Sure, that's a good idea.

1706
01:25:12,744 --> 01:25:14,226
One whiff of that stuff will turn you

1707
01:25:14,304 --> 01:25:17,035
into something out of a goddamn

1708
01:25:18,284 --> 01:25:20,546
medical encyclopedia, man.

1709
01:25:22,613 --> 01:25:24,564
Beautiful fucking tits.

1710
01:25:24,915 --> 01:25:27,879
Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon.

1711
01:25:27,957 --> 01:25:30,181
You'd gain about 100 pounds in two hours.

1712
01:25:30,454 --> 01:25:32,092
Right!

1713
01:25:32,170 --> 01:25:34,433
Grow claws, bleeding warts.

1714
01:25:34,589 --> 01:25:36,032
Yes.

1715
01:25:36,110 --> 01:25:39,660
And then you'd notice about six huge, hairy tits

1716
01:25:39,737 --> 01:25:41,688
swelling up on your back.

1717
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,678
Fantastic!

1718
01:25:43,755 --> 01:25:45,355
You'd go blind.

1719
01:25:47,033 --> 01:25:49,099
Your body would turn to wax.

1720
01:25:49,723 --> 01:25:51,674
They'd have to put you in a wheelbarrow.

1721
01:25:51,752 --> 01:25:53,624
And when you scream for help,

1722
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:55,926
you'll sound like a raccoon.

1723
01:25:57,954 --> 01:26:00,646
Man, I'll try just about anything,

1724
01:26:00,763 --> 01:26:03,766
but I'd never in hell touch a pineal gland.

1725
01:26:03,845 --> 01:26:06,575
Finish the fucking story, man!

1726
01:26:06,653 --> 01:26:09,696
What happened?
What about the glands?

1727
01:26:09,969 --> 01:26:13,207
Jesus, that stuff got right on top of you, didn't it?

1728
01:26:13,284 --> 01:26:16,132
Look at your face.
You're about to explode.

1729
01:26:23,505 --> 01:26:25,104
Maybe you could just

1730
01:26:26,898 --> 01:26:28,810
shove me into the pool.

1731
01:26:28,888 --> 01:26:30,955
Man, if I put you in the pool right now,

1732
01:26:31,034 --> 01:26:33,179
you'll sink like a goddamn stone.

1733
01:26:33,803 --> 01:26:36,885
You took too much, man.
You took too much. Too much.

1734
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:41,605
Don't try and fight it.

1735
01:26:41,683 --> 01:26:44,920
You'll get brain bubbles, strokes, aneurysms.

1736
01:26:45,271 --> 01:26:47,612
You'll just wither up and die.

1737
01:26:50,928 --> 01:26:52,644
<i>They continue killing innocent people!</i>

1738
01:26:52,721 --> 01:26:56,272
<i>Allowing the hopes for peace and
freedom of millions of people</i>

1739
01:26:56,349 --> 01:26:57,754
<i>to be suffocated.</i>

1740
01:26:58,183 --> 01:27:01,030
<i>So tonight, to you,</i>

1741
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:03,683
<i>the great silent majority …</i>

1742
01:27:03,839 --> 01:27:05,400
<i>Sacrifice. Sacrifice.</i>

1743
01:27:05,477 --> 01:27:07,233
<i>Sacrifice.
Sacrifice. Sacrifice.</i>

1744
01:27:07,311 --> 01:27:10,119
<i>Sacrifice. Sacrifice.
Sacrifice. Sacrifice.</i>

1745
01:27:10,198 --> 01:27:11,602
<i>Sacrifice.</i>

1746
01:27:17,570 --> 01:27:22,875
<i>I feel the cottonwood whispering above</i>

1747
01:27:23,461 --> 01:27:26,698
<i>Tammy, Tammy</i>

1748
01:27:27,166 --> 01:27:29,389
<i>Tammy's in love</i>

1749
01:27:31,574 --> 01:27:33,173
<i>What kind
of rat-bastard psychotic</i>

1750
01:27:33,251 --> 01:27:35,748
<i>would play that song right now, at this moment?</i>

1751
01:27:37,074 --> 01:27:39,687
<i>Tammy, Tammy</i>

1752
01:27:39,766 --> 01:27:41,638
<i>When I came to,</i>

1753
01:27:41,872 --> 01:27:44,875
<i>the general back-alley ambience
of the suite was so rotten,</i>

1754
01:27:45,071 --> 01:27:46,904
<i>so incredibly foul.</i>

1755
01:27:48,776 --> 01:27:51,507
<i>How long had I been lying there?</i>

1756
01:27:51,663 --> 01:27:53,692
<i>All these signs of violence.</i>

1757
01:27:54,393 --> 01:27:55,369
<i>What had happened?</i>

1758
01:27:56,578 --> 01:27:58,411
<i>There was evidence in this room of excessive consumption</i>

1759
01:27:58,490 --> 01:28:03,482
<i>of almost every type of drug known
to civilized man since 1544 A.D.</i>

1760
01:28:09,997 --> 01:28:11,557
Oh, ah, Debbie.

1761
01:28:12,181 --> 01:28:13,274
Thank God.

1762
01:28:13,937 --> 01:28:17,174
Oh, Debbie. Hmm? Look.

1763
01:28:19,086 --> 01:28:21,075
<i>What kind of addict would need all these coconut husks</i>

1764
01:28:21,153 --> 01:28:23,104
<i>and crushed honeydew rinds?</i>

1765
01:28:23,259 --> 01:28:26,341
<i>Would the presence of junkies account
for all these uneaten French fries?</i>

1766
01:28:26,536 --> 01:28:29,306
<i>These puddles of glazed ketchup on the bureau?</i>

1767
01:28:29,384 --> 01:28:30,594
<i>Maybe so.</i>

1768
01:28:31,568 --> 01:28:33,012
<i>But then why all this booze</i>

1769
01:28:33,597 --> 01:28:35,196
<i>and these crude pornographic photos</i>

1770
01:28:35,275 --> 01:28:37,965
<i>smeared with mustard that had
dried to a hard, yellow crust?</i>

1771
01:28:38,044 --> 01:28:40,774
<i>These were not the hoofprints of
your normal God-fearing junkie.</i>

1772
01:28:41,203 --> 01:28:43,700
<i>It was too savage, too aggressive.</i>

1773
01:28:43,778 --> 01:28:45,417
Put your hands where I can see them.

1774
01:28:45,494 --> 01:28:47,757
What? What?
Jesus God, man. Huh?

1775
01:28:48,147 --> 01:28:50,292
Put your hands where I can see them.

1776
01:28:50,682 --> 01:28:52,477
Put your hands where I can see them!

1777
01:28:53,686 --> 01:28:56,339
<i>Grim memories and bad flashbacks.</i>

1778
01:28:56,807 --> 01:28:58,289
<i>Get a grip.</i>

1779
01:28:58,445 --> 01:28:59,927
<i>Maintain.</i>

1780
01:29:00,980 --> 01:29:04,179
<i>How many nights and weird mornings
had this shit been going on?</i>

1781
01:29:20,212 --> 01:29:22,747
<i>Something ugly had happened.
I was sure of it.</i>

1782
01:29:28,755 --> 01:29:31,914
Who is that?
Oh. Shit, that's me.

1783
01:29:36,595 --> 01:29:38,155
Help me!
The fuck!

1784
01:29:38,311 --> 01:29:39,443
What the fuck?

1785
01:29:40,535 --> 01:29:41,783
Oh, shit.

1786
01:29:45,021 --> 01:29:47,673
You're under arrest!
She must have used a pass key.

1787
01:29:47,790 --> 01:29:48,999
I was polishing my shoes in the closet

1788
01:29:49,078 --> 01:29:50,560
when I noticed her sneaking in, so I took her.

1789
01:29:50,638 --> 01:29:51,808
What made you do it?
Who paid you off?

1790
01:29:51,886 --> 01:29:53,173
Nobody! I'm the maid!

1791
01:29:53,252 --> 01:29:54,968
You're just as much a part of it as they are.

1792
01:29:55,046 --> 01:29:56,255
Part of what?

1793
01:29:56,334 --> 01:29:57,894
The goddamn dope ring.

1794
01:29:57,971 --> 01:29:59,493
You must know what's going on in this hotel.

1795
01:29:59,571 --> 01:30:01,131
Why do you think we're here?

1796
01:30:01,209 --> 01:30:02,808
I know you're the cops,

1797
01:30:02,925 --> 01:30:05,227
but I thought you were just here for the convention.

1798
01:30:05,305 --> 01:30:08,075
I swear. All I wanted to do
was clean up the room.

1799
01:30:08,621 --> 01:30:10,688
I don't know anything about no dope.

1800
01:30:10,767 --> 01:30:12,170
Come on, baby.

1801
01:30:12,249 --> 01:30:14,277
Don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman.

1802
01:30:14,355 --> 01:30:16,695
I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff.

1803
01:30:17,008 --> 01:30:18,568
Maybe she's telling the truth.

1804
01:30:19,036 --> 01:30:20,675
Maybe she's not part of it.

1805
01:30:20,752 --> 01:30:23,365
I swear I'm not. I swear.

1806
01:30:26,253 --> 01:30:28,046
In that case, maybe she can help.

1807
01:30:28,125 --> 01:30:30,387
Oh, yes, I'll help you all you want.

1808
01:30:30,777 --> 01:30:32,104
I hate dope.

1809
01:30:32,610 --> 01:30:33,625
So do we.

1810
01:30:33,703 --> 01:30:35,458
I think we should put her on the payroll,

1811
01:30:35,926 --> 01:30:37,487
see what she comes up with.

1812
01:30:37,565 --> 01:30:39,242
- You think you can handle it?
- What?

1813
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:41,309
One phone call every day.

1814
01:30:41,543 --> 01:30:43,026
Don't worry if it doesn't add up.

1815
01:30:43,338 --> 01:30:44,391
That's our problem.

1816
01:30:44,470 --> 01:30:46,069
You'd pay me for that?

1817
01:30:46,146 --> 01:30:47,902
You're damn right we would.

1818
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:51,334
But the first time that you say
anything about this to anybody

1819
01:30:51,451 --> 01:30:54,026
you will go straight to prison for the rest of your life.

1820
01:30:54,299 --> 01:30:55,352
What's your name?

1821
01:30:55,431 --> 01:30:56,835
Alice.
Prove it!

1822
01:30:58,122 --> 01:30:59,292
Okay.

1823
01:30:59,604 --> 01:31:01,555
Just ring Linen Service and ask for Alice.

1824
01:31:01,633 --> 01:31:02,998
All right, Alice.

1825
01:31:06,313 --> 01:31:10,058
You'll be contacted by Inspector Rock, Arthur Rock.

1826
01:31:10,878 --> 01:31:12,438
He'll be posing as a politician,

1827
01:31:12,516 --> 01:31:14,076
but you'll have no problem recognizing him.

1828
01:31:14,155 --> 01:31:18,055
That's right, Inspector Rock will pay you in cash.

1829
01:31:18,133 --> 01:31:20,045
$1,000 on the ninth of every month.

1830
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:22,931
Oh, Lord! I'd do just about
anything for that.

1831
01:31:23,009 --> 01:31:24,804
You and a lot of other people.

1832
01:31:24,881 --> 01:31:28,315
Come here. The password is,
"One hand washes the other."

1833
01:31:28,471 --> 01:31:32,098
The minute you hear that,
you say, "I fear nothing."

1834
01:31:32,371 --> 01:31:33,659
Say it.

1835
01:31:33,736 --> 01:31:34,906
I fear nothing.
Say it again!

1836
01:31:34,985 --> 01:31:36,311
I fear nothing!
Very good.

1837
01:31:36,623 --> 01:31:37,950
Get the fuck out of here.

1838
01:31:38,027 --> 01:31:40,056
Oh, yeah, listen.
Nice meeting you.

1839
01:31:41,460 --> 01:31:42,904
Don't bother to make up the room.

1840
01:31:42,981 --> 01:31:46,063
Just leave a pile of towels and soap
outside the door exactly at midnight.

1841
01:31:46,141 --> 01:31:48,559
That way we won't have to risk another

1842
01:31:48,638 --> 01:31:50,120
one of these little incidents, will we?

1843
01:31:50,198 --> 01:31:51,758
Whatever you say, gentlemen.

1844
01:31:51,836 --> 01:31:53,436
Thank God for decent people.

1845
01:31:54,216 --> 01:31:56,244
<i>- Say it again!
- I fear nothing!</i>

1846
01:31:56,751 --> 01:31:58,000
<i>Terrible gibberish.</i>

1847
01:31:58,077 --> 01:32:00,730
<i>Splintered memories looming up out of the time fog.</i>

1848
01:32:01,081 --> 01:32:03,071
<i>Just press play.</i>

1849
01:32:03,773 --> 01:32:05,645
<i>This is it, the American Dream.</i>

1850
01:32:05,723 --> 01:32:06,659
<i>Shit!</i>

1851
01:32:06,737 --> 01:32:08,047
<i>We're sitting on the main nerve right now.</i>

1852
01:32:08,102 --> 01:32:09,819
<i>Yeah, don't get me started.</i>

1853
01:32:10,326 --> 01:32:13,836
The owner always wanted to run away and
join the circus when he was a kid.

1854
01:32:13,915 --> 01:32:15,944
Now the son of a bitch owns the circus.

1855
01:32:16,997 --> 01:32:20,078
Ah, man, a real license to steal.

1856
01:32:20,156 --> 01:32:21,444
Oh, yeah.

1857
01:32:21,521 --> 01:32:23,198
The American Dream come true, man.

1858
01:32:23,277 --> 01:32:24,837
Pure Horatio Alger.

1859
01:32:25,461 --> 01:32:27,568
Yeah. Welcome
to the happy place.

1860
01:32:29,284 --> 01:32:32,639
Listen, let's get down to brass tacks here.

1861
01:32:33,107 --> 01:32:34,745
How much for the ape?

1862
01:32:34,979 --> 01:32:36,930
How much you got?

1863
01:32:37,281 --> 01:32:39,232
<i>How much do you think you'd take for the ape?</i>

1864
01:32:39,465 --> 01:32:41,415
<i>Just wait here.
I'll be back.</i>

1865
01:32:41,494 --> 01:32:44,419
<i>Madness.
It made no sense at all.</i>

1866
01:32:44,497 --> 01:32:46,330
<i>I desperately needed the facts.</i>

1867
01:32:54,288 --> 01:32:56,044
What the fuck is going on?

1868
01:32:56,121 --> 01:32:57,916
Where's the ape, man?
Where's the ape?

1869
01:32:57,994 --> 01:33:00,218
Forget about it.
He attacked an old man.

1870
01:33:00,373 --> 01:33:01,622
Bit off the head of the bartender,

1871
01:33:01,700 --> 01:33:04,236
then the cops came and took him away.

1872
01:33:05,796 --> 01:33:07,512
Is that your car?

1873
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:14,222
Somebody stop them!

1874
01:33:14,299 --> 01:33:15,821
You poor fools don't understand, do you?

1875
01:33:15,898 --> 01:33:18,279
This car is property of the World Bank.
That money goes to Italy.

1876
01:33:18,356 --> 01:33:20,892
You can't put on a circus without a tent.

1877
01:33:20,969 --> 01:33:23,778
The top is completely jammed.
You're right.

1878
01:33:24,363 --> 01:33:25,650
There's something wrong with the motor.

1879
01:33:25,729 --> 01:33:27,562
We're all riders of the storm.

1880
01:33:27,641 --> 01:33:30,488
Where are you, you fucking monkey?
You can't do that!

1881
01:33:32,750 --> 01:33:34,311
You people voted for Hubert Humphrey.

1882
01:33:34,389 --> 01:33:35,675
And you killed Jesus.

1883
01:33:35,793 --> 01:33:38,406
<i>There was every reason to believe
that we'd been heading for trouble,</i>

1884
01:33:38,484 --> 01:33:40,825
<i>that we'd pushed our luck a bit too far.</i>

1885
01:33:40,903 --> 01:33:43,477
Oh, gosh, shit! God!

1886
01:33:45,506 --> 01:33:47,456
Right. Uh …

1887
01:33:47,535 --> 01:33:49,407
The possibility

1888
01:33:49,485 --> 01:33:52,059
of physical and mental collapse

1889
01:33:52,606 --> 01:33:54,672
is now very real.

1890
01:33:55,258 --> 01:33:57,053
No sympathy for the devil.

1891
01:33:57,599 --> 01:33:59,353
Keep that in mind.

1892
01:33:59,666 --> 01:34:01,538
Uh, buy the ticket …

1893
01:34:02,162 --> 01:34:04,425
Uh, take the ride.

1894
01:34:08,131 --> 01:34:09,535
Hey, there.

1895
01:34:09,613 --> 01:34:11,993
You folks want to buy some heroin?

1896
01:34:18,858 --> 01:34:21,081
Hey, honkies! Goddamn it!

1897
01:34:21,159 --> 01:34:22,954
Pull ahead, will you?

1898
01:34:23,031 --> 01:34:26,269
I want to sell you some pure fucking scag!

1899
01:34:26,348 --> 01:34:28,766
Cheap! The real stuff.

1900
01:34:28,844 --> 01:34:32,238
I just got back from Vietnam.

1901
01:34:37,347 --> 01:34:38,479
Scag.

1902
01:34:40,546 --> 01:34:43,472
I want to sell you some pure fucking scag.

1903
01:34:43,667 --> 01:34:45,969
Shit! Fuck!

1904
01:34:47,022 --> 01:34:50,610
Now hear me, you bastard!
Pull over! I'll kill you!

1905
01:34:50,689 --> 01:34:52,093
<i>Pull over! Come on!</i>

1906
01:34:53,692 --> 01:34:55,291
Oh, shit. Oh, oh.

1907
01:35:03,288 --> 01:35:07,072
Okay. Let's see here.

1908
01:35:14,015 --> 01:35:17,682
<i>The mentality of Las Vegas is so grossly atavistic</i>

1909
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:21,193
<i>that a really massive crime often slips by unrecognized.</i>

1910
01:35:26,147 --> 01:35:29,697
<i>North Vegas is where you go when you've
fucked up once too often on the Strip.</i>

1911
01:35:29,891 --> 01:35:32,973
<i>And when you're not even welcome
in the cut-rate downtown places.</i>

1912
01:35:38,006 --> 01:35:41,828
<i>The North Star Coffee Lounge seemed like
a fairly safe haven from our storms.</i>

1913
01:35:41,907 --> 01:35:44,090
<i>No hassles, no talk.</i>

1914
01:35:44,169 --> 01:35:46,314
<i>Just a place to rest and regroup.</i>

1915
01:35:46,392 --> 01:35:48,108
<i>I wasn't even hungry.</i>

1916
01:35:48,771 --> 01:35:50,424
<i>There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star</i>

1917
01:35:50,449 --> 01:35:52,088
<i>to put me on my guard.</i>

1918
01:35:53,882 --> 01:35:56,144
Two glasses of ice water with ice.

1919
01:35:57,626 --> 01:35:59,616
Two glasses of ice water with ice.

1920
01:36:05,116 --> 01:36:06,248
Two.

1921
01:36:14,244 --> 01:36:16,974
<i>She looked like a burnt-out caricature of Jane Russell.</i>

1922
01:36:17,677 --> 01:36:20,017
<i>She was definitely in charge here.</i>

1923
01:36:24,347 --> 01:36:26,219
<i>He did it very casually,</i>

1924
01:36:26,298 --> 01:36:28,716
<i>but I knew that our peace was about to be shattered.</i>

1925
01:36:29,926 --> 01:36:31,369
What was that?

1926
01:36:42,251 --> 01:36:43,734
What is this?

1927
01:36:44,553 --> 01:36:45,645
It's a napkin.

1928
01:36:45,841 --> 01:36:46,972
Don't give me that bullshit.

1929
01:36:47,050 --> 01:36:49,820
I know what that means, you fat goddamn pimp bastard!

1930
01:36:51,496 --> 01:36:53,759
That's the name of a horse I used to own, ma'am.

1931
01:36:54,032 --> 01:36:55,203
What's wrong with you?

1932
01:36:55,514 --> 01:36:57,075
<i>The question mark was emphasized.</i>

1933
01:36:57,699 --> 01:36:59,142
You listen to me, you son of a bitch.

1934
01:36:59,221 --> 01:37:00,585
I gotta take a lot of shit in this place,

1935
01:37:00,664 --> 01:37:02,966
but I don't have to take it off no spic pimp!

1936
01:37:07,685 --> 01:37:09,987
Anybody that knows anything knows that.

1937
01:37:13,108 --> 01:37:15,448
Go on! Pay your check
and get out of here!

1938
01:37:15,526 --> 01:37:16,657
You want me to call the cops?

1939
01:37:16,735 --> 01:37:18,218
I'll call the fuck …

1940
01:37:18,490 --> 01:37:19,778
Oh, shit.

1941
01:37:24,420 --> 01:37:25,785
Fuck.

1942
01:37:29,061 --> 01:37:30,622
Want me to call the cops?

1943
01:37:55,275 --> 01:37:57,382
How much is that lemon meringue pie?

1944
01:37:57,459 --> 01:37:59,956
<i>Her eyes were turgid with fear,
but her brain was functioning</i>

1945
01:38:00,112 --> 01:38:01,750
<i>on some basic motor survival level.</i>

1946
01:38:01,828 --> 01:38:03,310
35 cents.

1947
01:38:03,389 --> 01:38:04,793
How much is that lemon meringue pie?

1948
01:38:04,910 --> 01:38:06,275
35 cents.

1949
01:38:06,354 --> 01:38:09,162
Whoo! What a waste of talent.

1950
01:38:09,513 --> 01:38:12,907
No, honey, I mean the whole pie.

1951
01:38:14,623 --> 01:38:15,833
The whole pie.

1952
01:38:18,836 --> 01:38:20,007
Hmm?

1953
01:38:27,457 --> 01:38:29,446
What, three?

1954
01:38:34,830 --> 01:38:37,716
Three? Four?

1955
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:41,656
Five? Hmm?

1956
01:38:42,007 --> 01:38:43,333
Five.

1957
01:39:07,753 --> 01:39:09,117
I'll be in the car.

1958
01:40:02,442 --> 01:40:05,562
<i>The sight of the blade had triggered bad memories.</i>

1959
01:40:05,679 --> 01:40:08,605
<i>The glazed look in her eyes said her throat had been cut.</i>

1960
01:40:08,683 --> 01:40:11,921
<i>She was still in the grip of paralysis when we left.</i>

1961
01:40:20,697 --> 01:40:22,257
<i>It was all over now.</i>

1962
01:40:22,609 --> 01:40:25,301
<i>We'd abused every rule that Vegas lived by.</i>

1963
01:40:25,964 --> 01:40:29,006
<i>Threatening the locals, abusing the tourists,</i>

1964
01:40:29,084 --> 01:40:30,918
<i>terrifying the help.</i>

1965
01:40:30,995 --> 01:40:32,712
<i>The only chance now, I felt</i>

1966
01:40:32,790 --> 01:40:35,599
<i>was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess</i>

1967
01:40:36,027 --> 01:40:38,524
<i>that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us</i>

1968
01:40:38,602 --> 01:40:40,280
<i>could possibly believe it.</i>

1969
01:40:40,826 --> 01:40:43,400
<i>Fifteen minutes to get my attorney to the airport,</i>

1970
01:40:43,985 --> 01:40:45,428
<i>could we make it?</i>

1971
01:40:46,131 --> 01:40:47,847
Christ!

1972
01:40:48,744 --> 01:40:50,188
No!

1973
01:40:51,046 --> 01:40:52,216
Oh, fuck!

1974
01:40:52,294 --> 01:40:54,127
Fuck.
Whoa, shit! Whoa, shit!

1975
01:40:54,206 --> 01:40:56,507
Oh, God. Oh, God.
You son of a bitch!

1976
01:40:56,585 --> 01:40:57,951
Oh, God.

1977
01:40:59,744 --> 01:41:01,734
You're going the wrong way.
The next left.

1978
01:41:02,007 --> 01:41:02,943
Stop!

1979
01:41:03,022 --> 01:41:05,362
Go! Fuck!

1980
01:41:09,302 --> 01:41:11,603
Take a right here.
Take a right here.

1981
01:41:20,341 --> 01:41:22,799
Goddamn it. We're lost.

1982
01:41:23,579 --> 01:41:26,426
What are we doing out here on this godforsaken road?

1983
01:41:27,167 --> 01:41:28,962
The airport's over there.

1984
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:31,692
Goddamn it! It's over there.

1985
01:41:32,472 --> 01:41:34,267
I've never missed a plane yet.

1986
01:41:56,150 --> 01:41:57,438
Hold on!

1987
01:42:03,016 --> 01:42:05,357
All right. I'm gonna drop you
right next to the plane.

1988
01:42:05,434 --> 01:42:07,970
Fuck you. I'm gonna have to take the blame.
They'll crucify me.

1989
01:42:08,047 --> 01:42:09,491
Right here, right here.

1990
01:42:09,569 --> 01:42:10,545
Ridiculous, man.

1991
01:42:10,622 --> 01:42:14,367
Just say you were hitchhiking to
the airport, and I picked you up.

1992
01:42:14,446 --> 01:42:15,499
You bastard.

1993
01:42:15,576 --> 01:42:16,669
Get out.

1994
01:42:26,654 --> 01:42:28,605
Hey, hey! Hey, listen.

1995
01:42:29,112 --> 01:42:31,218
Don't take any guff from these swine.

1996
01:42:31,452 --> 01:42:33,871
If you have any trouble, remember,

1997
01:42:34,066 --> 01:42:36,095
you can always send a telegram to the right people.

1998
01:42:36,173 --> 01:42:38,006
Yeah, explaining my position.

1999
01:42:38,162 --> 01:42:40,034
Some asshole wrote a poem about that once.

2000
01:42:40,659 --> 01:42:43,428
Probably good advice, if you have shit for brains.

2001
01:42:49,435 --> 01:42:53,493
<i>There he goes.
One of God's own prototypes.</i>

2002
01:42:54,273 --> 01:42:55,676
<i>A high-powered mutant
of some kind</i>

2003
01:42:55,755 --> 01:42:57,822
<i>never even considered for mass production.</i>

2004
01:42:58,329 --> 01:42:59,773
<i>Too weird to live,</i>

2005
01:43:00,007 --> 01:43:01,996
<i>and too rare to die.</i>

2006
01:43:21,539 --> 01:43:26,533
<i>There you stood on the edge of your feather</i>

2007
01:43:27,507 --> 01:43:31,369
<i>Expecting to fly</i>

2008
01:43:35,114 --> 01:43:37,884
<i>We're all wired into a survival trip now.</i>

2009
01:43:38,235 --> 01:43:40,614
<i>No more of the speed that fueled the '60s.</i>

2010
01:43:41,043 --> 01:43:43,618
<i>That was the fatal flaw in Tim Leary's trip.</i>

2011
01:43:44,202 --> 01:43:46,817
<i>He crashed around America, selling
"consciousness expansion"</i>

2012
01:43:47,011 --> 01:43:48,377
<i>without ever giving a thought</i>

2013
01:43:48,455 --> 01:43:50,327
<i>to the grim meat-hook realities that were lying in wait</i>

2014
01:43:50,405 --> 01:43:52,980
<i>for all those people who took him seriously.</i>

2015
01:43:53,721 --> 01:43:55,476
<i>All those pathetically eager acid freaks</i>

2016
01:43:55,555 --> 01:43:58,909
<i>who thought they could buy peace and
understanding for three bucks a hit.</i>

2017
01:43:59,573 --> 01:44:01,913
<i>But their loss and failure</i>

2018
01:44:02,263 --> 01:44:03,668
<i>is ours too.</i>

2019
01:44:04,487 --> 01:44:07,335
<i>What Leary took down with him was the
central illusion of a whole lifestyle</i>

2020
01:44:07,413 --> 01:44:08,856
<i>that he helped create.</i>

2021
01:44:09,402 --> 01:44:11,704
<i>A generation of permanent cripples,</i>

2022
01:44:11,781 --> 01:44:13,030
<i>failed seekers,</i>

2023
01:44:13,342 --> 01:44:17,125
<i>who never understood the essential
old-mystic fallacy of the acid culture.</i>

2024
01:44:18,023 --> 01:44:19,388
<i>The desperate assumption</i>

2025
01:44:19,466 --> 01:44:22,470
<i>that somebody or at least some force</i>

2026
01:44:22,548 --> 01:44:25,123
<i>is tending the light at the end of the tunnel.</i>

2027
01:44:31,598 --> 01:44:33,860
<i>There was only one road
back to L.A.</i>

2028
01:44:33,939 --> 01:44:36,162
<i>U.S. Interstate 15.</i>

2029
01:44:36,239 --> 01:44:39,907
<i>Just a flat out high-speed burn
through Baker and Barstow and Berdoo.</i>

2030
01:44:40,336 --> 01:44:41,506
<i>Then onto the Hollywood Freeway,</i>

2031
01:44:41,583 --> 01:44:42,793
<i>straight into frantic oblivion,</i>

2032
01:44:42,871 --> 01:44:45,290
<i>safety, obscurity.</i>

2033
01:44:45,368 --> 01:44:48,176
<i>Just another freak in the freak kingdom.</i>

2034
01:44:48,255 --> 01:44:52,663
<i>I was born
in a cross-fire hurricane</i>

2035
01:44:54,690 --> 01:44:59,840
<i>But I howled at my ma in the driving rain</i>

2036
01:45:01,322 --> 01:45:05,730
<i>But it's all right now</i>

2037
01:45:05,808 --> 01:45:07,875
<i>In fact, it's a gas</i>

2038
01:45:07,953 --> 01:45:11,425
<i>But it's all right</i>

2039
01:45:11,503 --> 01:45:14,780
<i>I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash.
It's a gas, gas, gas.</i>

2040
01:45:23,868 --> 01:45:28,706
<i>I was raised by a toothless, bearded hag</i>

2041
01:45:30,734 --> 01:45:35,688
<i>I was schooled with a strap right across my back</i>

2042
01:45:37,288 --> 01:45:41,735
<i>But it's all right now</i>

2043
01:45:41,812 --> 01:45:43,841
<i>In fact, it's a gas</i>

2044
01:45:43,919 --> 01:45:47,430
<i>But it's all right</i>

2045
01:45:47,508 --> 01:45:51,057
<i>I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash.
It's a gas, gas, gas</i>

2046
01:46:18,129 --> 01:46:23,200
