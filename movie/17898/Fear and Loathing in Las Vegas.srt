00:09:12,381 --> 00:09:14,711
You Samoans are all the same.

159
00:09:14,817 --> 00:09:19,718
You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.

160
00:09:19,855 --> 00:09:21,718
[Duke Narrating] The store was closed...

161
00:09:21,857 --> 00:09:24,722
but the salesman said he could wait if we'd hurry.

162
00:09:24,923 --> 00:09:26,856
- [Horns Honking] - [Sirens Wailing]

163
00:09:26,861 --> 00:09:30,090
But we were delayed en route when the Stingray in front of us killed a pedestrian.

164
00:09:31,398 --> 00:09:34,263
We had trouble again with the car rental agency.

165
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,766
Mr. Duke, we're all settled. If I could get your John Hancock, you're on your way.

166
00:09:37,903 --> 00:09:41,598
- Yeah. - You're gonna be real careful with this car, right?

167
00:09:41,773 --> 00:09:43,636
Oh, yeah, man. Of course.

168
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,645
[Tires Screech]

169
00:09:49,647 --> 00:09:52,512
[Panting] Holy smokes!

170
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:56,516
You just backed over a 2-foot concrete abutment, you didn't even slow down.

171
00:09:56,653 --> 00:09:59,677
What, were you going about, uh, oh, I don't know, 45 miles an hour backwards?

172
00:09:59,822 --> 00:10:01,685
- There's no harm done. - Oh?

173
00:10:01,824 --> 00:10:04,689
I always test the transmission that way, the rear end for stress factors.

174
00:10:04,827 --> 00:10:07,692
- Boy, this is really a nice pen, man. - Hey, uh, listen, you...

175
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:10,694
you fellas haven't been, uh, drinking, have you?

176
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,696
- No. Not me. - Oh. Well...

177
00:10:12,867 --> 00:10:15,732
- We're responsible people. - [Engine Revving, Tires Screeching]

178
00:10:15,869 --> 00:10:17,732
Damn it, you've got my pen!

179
00:10:19,206 --> 00:10:21,069
Goddamn hippies!

180
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:27,801
We spent the rest of that night rounding up materials and packing the car.

181
00:10:27,947 --> 00:10:30,812
Then we ate some mescaline and went swimming.

182
00:10:33,018 --> 00:10:34,881
Our trip was different.

183
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:36,882
It was to be a classic affirmation...

184
00:10:37,021 --> 00:10:39,886
of everything right and true in the national character...

185
00:10:40,024 --> 00:10:43,116
a gross physical salute to the fantastic possibilities of life in this country.

186
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,123
But only for those with true grit.

187
00:10:45,262 --> 00:10:47,558
And we are chock full of that, man.

188
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:50,200
Damn right!

189
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:53,724
My attorney understands this concept, despite his racial handicap.

190
00:10:53,869 --> 00:10:56,234
- But do you? - [Giggling]

191
00:10:56,372 --> 00:11:00,569
He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't.

192
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:03,607
- He was lying to me. - [Gonzo Screams]

193
00:11:05,024 --> 00:11:07,491
Ohh! Aaah!

194
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:15,755
Aaah! Aaah!

195
00:11:15,855 --> 00:11:17,718
Ohhhhh! Medicine!

196
00:11:17,857 --> 00:11:19,720
- What? - Medicine!

197
00:11:19,892 --> 00:11:22,484
Medicine? Oh, yeah, medicine! Right. Right here.

198
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:25,526
- [Shrieking] - Don't worry. This man has a bad heart.

199
00:11:25,664 --> 00:11:27,527
Angina pectoris.

200
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:30,498
But we have a cure for it. Here you go. All right.

201
00:11:30,634 --> 00:11:33,499
Big whiff. Big whiff. Big whiff, sonny boy.

202
00:11:33,637 --> 00:11:36,502
- Ah. There you go. Much better. - [Sighs]

203
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:39,129
- Now for the doctor. - [Groans Loudly]

204
00:11:42,862 --> 00:11:45,955
[Squealing]

205
00:11:51,853 --> 00:11:53,716
What the...

206
00:11:53,889 --> 00:11:57,288
What the fuck are we doing out here in the middle of the desert?

207
00:11:57,459 --> 00:12:00,187
Somebody call the police. We need help.

208
00:12:00,295 --> 00:12:03,262
- We need help. We need help. We need help. - [Horn Honks]

209
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,350
[Laughing]

210
00:12:12,004 --> 00:12:13,867
The truth.

211
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,803
Truth?

212
00:12:16,942 --> 00:12:19,136
We're goin' to Vegas...

213
00:12:19,277 --> 00:12:23,837
to croak a scag baron named Savage Henry.

214
00:12:23,981 --> 00:12:27,005
- It's true. - Why? Because I've known him for years...

215
00:12:27,185 --> 00:12:29,048
but he ripped us off.

216
00:12:29,187 --> 00:12:31,585
- [Duke] And you know what that means. - And you know what that means.

217
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:33,550
- Right? - No. - Mm-hmm.

218
00:12:33,657 --> 00:12:35,520
Savage Henry...

219
00:12:35,658 --> 00:12:37,521
has cashed his check.

220
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,525
- Cashed his check. - And we're gonna rip his lungs out.

221
00:12:40,663 --> 00:12:43,892
- [Hammer Clicking] - And eat them. That bastard won't get away with this.

222
00:12:44,033 --> 00:12:46,898
I mean, what is going on in this country...

223
00:12:47,035 --> 00:12:50,526
when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?

224
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,702
- Hey! - Thanks for the ride!

225
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:56,206
- Don't worry about me! [Giggling] - Wait a minute!

226
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:58,206
Come back and have a beer!

227
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:00,208
Shit.

228
00:13:00,378 --> 00:13:02,537
Fuck. I'm gonna miss him.

229
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:05,080
- Move over! - Did you see his eyes?

230
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:08,082
We have to get out of California before that kid finds a cop.

231
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:10,049
Scoot over, you fat bastard.

232
00:13:10,188 --> 00:13:13,554
- We had a real freak on our hands! - Oh, shit.

233
00:13:16,026 --> 00:13:19,289
[Duke Narrating] It was absolutely imperative that we get to the Mint Hotel...

234
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,293
before the deadline for press registration.

235
00:13:21,431 --> 00:13:24,627
Otherwise we might have to pay for our suite.

236
00:13:29,168 --> 00:13:30,406
[Screeches]

237
00:13:30,506 --> 00:13:34,906
Jesus! Did you see what God just did to us, man?

238
00:13:35,077 --> 00:13:37,442
God didn't do that. You did it.

239
00:13:37,578 --> 00:13:39,441
You're a narcotics agent. I knew it.

240
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:43,104
That was our cocaine, you fucking pig, swine, whore!

241
00:13:43,217 --> 00:13:45,479
You'd better be careful.

242
00:13:45,619 --> 00:13:49,382
Plenty of vultures out here that'll pick your bones clean before morning.

243
00:13:49,522 --> 00:13:52,216
- You fucking whore. - Hee hee hee.

244
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:56,082
Here's your half of the sunshine acid. Eat it.

245
00:13:56,228 --> 00:13:58,593
Yeah.

246
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:00,593
Great.

247
00:14:00,732 --> 00:14:02,721
How long do I have?

248
00:14:02,867 --> 00:14:05,732
As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed...

249
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:09,770
or it'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal.

Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name...

254
00:14:19,815 --> 00:14:23,306
with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid?

00:14:23,452 --> 00:14:25,475
I sure hope so.

I'll remember your face.

00:15:14,363 --> 00:15:17,660
[Duke Narrating] There is no way of explaining the terror I felt.

My blood is too thick for Nevada.

I've never been able to properly explain myself in this climate.

[Man Chattering]

282

[Duke Narrating] Okay. Be quiet, be calm.

They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot...

and cut all kinds of holes in her and sucked out the blood.

288

They were after the pineal gland, I think. Yeah.

Uh... Raoul Duke!

00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,610
Total coverage. Uh-huh.

298
00:16:24,457 --> 00:16:27,322

[Muttering] Must have that suite.

303

00:16:41,372 --> 00:16:43,100

Aah! No! We haven't done anything yet!

308

Aaah! [Whimpering]

Come on. Come on. Come on.

- What's that? - Come on, come on. Let's get some peanuts.

That's one thing that's good for you. Peanuts.

otherwise we'll never get out of this place alive.

335

Impossible to walk in this muck.

and somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things.

In some circles the Mint 400 is a far, far better thing...

with a purse of $50,000 going to the winner...

446
00:24:21,206 --> 00:24:23,672

in-your-face motocross extravaganza!

There they go. [Mutters]

We're ready to go. It's the green flag, and they're off!

455
00:24:46,627 --> 00:24:49,788
Another great start with a lot of dirt happening on this hill!

456
00:24:49,931 --> 00:24:53,660
All right, here we go with the third group. And they're off!

457

Number 45 riding in the number-four position...

458

is choking as the dust flies!

459
00:24:59,638 --> 00:25:03,333
You'd better wet those bandannas you got stretched over your face!

[Duke Narrating] There was something like 190 more bikes waiting to start.

462
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,345
- Gimme a beer, man. - They were due to go off, ten at a time...

463

every two minutes.

- Goddamn it. What day is it? Saturday? - Shit.

468
00:25:22,392 --> 00:25:24,255
- More like Sunday. - Ahh.

469
00:25:28,764 --> 00:25:30,627
Hello! Anyone?

470
00:25:30,766 --> 00:25:32,629
Have you seen the race?

471
00:25:32,767 --> 00:25:36,633

Now it was an endurance contest.

474
00:25:42,276 --> 00:25:46,711
The idea of trying to cover this race in any conventional press sense was absurd.

Are we here to entertain ourselves or do the job?

Do the job, of course.

This is not a parking area! You've got to move your car!

Is this not a reasonable place to park?

[Duke Narrating] One of the things you learn after years of dealing with drug people...

835
00:44:42,424 --> 00:44:45,289
is that you can turn your back on a person...

836
00:44:45,427 --> 00:44:48,292
but never turn your back on a drug...

What was the meaning of this trip?

843
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:08,276
Was I just roaming around in a drug frenzy of some kind...

844
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:12,280
or had I really come out here to Las Vegas to work on a story?

Where do they come from?

847
00:45:24,628 --> 00:45:27,824
They look like caricatures of used car dealers from Dallas...

848
00:45:27,963 --> 00:45:32,830
and, sweet Jesus, there are a hell of a lot of them at 4:30 on a Sunday morning...

Um, this telegram came for you.

1103

Actually, it's not for you. It's for somebody named, uh, Thompson.

01:00:04,246 --> 01:00:07,544
But it says, "Care of Raoul Duke." Do you... Do you...

Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles when we knew he was right here.

Right. You did the right thing.

- Awake? What do you mean? - Well, um...

1117
01:00:44,923 --> 01:00:48,517
my manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him.

1118

Mr. Heem likes to meet all of our large accounts...

1121
01:00:57,670 --> 01:00:59,796
Just a chat and a handshake. You understand.

Of course, but if I were you...

1123

I would leave the doctor alone until after he's eaten his breakfast...

Look, the telegram is actually all scrambled.

1129
01:01:20,461 --> 01:01:23,395
It's actually from Thompson, not to him.

Good morning. How are you? All right, man. Doing very well.

Few people understand the psychology of dealing with a highway traffic cop.

1150
01:02:41,071 --> 01:02:45,646
Your normal speeder will panic and immediately pull over to the side.

1151

This is wrong. It arouses contempt in the cop heart.

This is to let him know you're pulling off for a proper place to talk.

1156

It'll take him a moment to realize he's about to make a 180-degree turn, at speed.

1157
01:03:04,595 --> 01:03:06,962
It'll take him a moment to realize he's about to make a 180-degree turn, at speed.

01:08:36,895 --> 01:08:39,988
I was going back to Vegas. I had no choice.

1254
01:08:40,966 --> 01:08:42,899


1255
01:08:43,303 --> 01:08:45,328
I had to get rid of the Shark.

1256
01:08:45,472 --> 01:08:49,670
Too many people might recognize it, especially the Vegas police.

1257
01:08:51,076 --> 01:08:54,807
Luckily, my credit card was still technically valid.

1258
01:08:54,948 --> 01:08:58,110
Now this was a superior machine.

1259
01:08:58,252 --> 01:09:02,119
Ten grand worth of gimmicks and high-priced special effects.

1260
01:09:02,256 --> 01:09:05,623
The rear windows leapt up with a touch like frogs in a dynamite pond.

1261
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:09,126
The dashboard was full of esoteric lights and dials and meters...

1262
01:09:09,263 --> 01:09:10,593
that I would never understand.

1263
01:09:11,765 --> 01:09:13,322
If the pigs were gathering in Vegas...

1264
01:09:13,968 --> 01:09:15,901
I felt the drug culture should be represented as well.

1265
01:09:16,304 --> 01:09:17,964


1266
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:21,040
And there was a certain bent appeal in the notion of running a savage burn...

1267
01:09:21,176 --> 01:09:23,040
on one Las Vegas hotel...

1268
01:09:23,178 --> 01:09:26,375
and then just wheeling across town and checking into another.

1269
01:09:26,516 --> 01:09:29,713
Me and a thousand ranking cops from all over America.

1270
01:09:29,852 --> 01:09:32,878
Why not move confidently into their midst?

1271
01:09:33,022 --> 01:09:36,479
- Welcome to the Flamingo Hotel, sir. - [Whimpers]

1272
01:09:36,626 --> 01:09:38,957
- [Grunts, Clears Throat] - Sir?

1273
01:09:39,096 --> 01:09:40,960
Yeah, hi. Right. Okay.

1274
01:09:41,001 --> 01:09:43,492
# Let me stay in your arms #

1275
01:09:43,572 --> 01:09:46,095
# I'm addicted to your charms #

1276
01:09:46,173 --> 01:09:50,040
# You're gettin' to be a habit with me #

1277
01:09:51,847 --> 01:09:54,576
# I used to think your love was something that I #

1278
01:09:54,651 --> 01:09:56,982
# Could take #

1279
01:09:57,148 --> 01:09:59,945
- # Or leave alone # - My arrival was badly timed.

1280
01:09:59,989 --> 01:10:03,856
# But now I couldn't do without my supply #

1281
01:10:03,927 --> 01:10:06,794
# I need you for my own #

1282
01:10:06,958 --> 01:10:10,155
# [Continues Faintly]

1283
01:10:13,298 --> 01:10:16,266
[Man] This here model is one that we had to use...

1284
01:10:16,435 --> 01:10:19,835
when we took on them little peckerheads down there at Kent State.

1285
01:10:19,972 --> 01:10:22,405
This baby here...

1286
01:10:24,343 --> 01:10:27,277
I'm a police chief from Michigan.

1287
01:10:27,414 --> 01:10:29,439
Look, fella, I have explained to you.

1288
01:10:29,583 --> 01:10:34,782
I have this postcard which says that I have a reservation in this hotel.

1289
01:10:34,921 --> 01:10:38,617
I'm very sorry, sir, but you're on the late list.

1290
01:10:38,759 --> 01:10:43,058
- So your reservation has been transferred to... - It's okay.

1291
01:10:43,197 --> 01:10:46,893
The... Moonlight Motel...

1292
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:49,501
which is just out on Paradise Boulevard.

1293
01:10:49,638 --> 01:10:52,664
We've already paid for our goddamn room!

1294
01:10:52,841 --> 01:10:55,832
It's actually a very fine place of lodging, and it's only 16 blocks from here.

1295
01:10:55,978 --> 01:10:57,911
It has a pool, sauna, steam.

1296
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:00,411
You listen to me, you filthy little faggot!

1297
01:11:00,549 --> 01:11:02,880
I want a manager down here, now, now!

1298
01:11:03,018 --> 01:11:06,044
Because I'm sick of listening to your dog shit!

1299
01:11:06,188 --> 01:11:09,179
- [Continues Yelling] - I am... very sorry, sir.

1300
01:11:09,325 --> 01:11:12,191
- Get off of me! Get away from me! - Can I call you a cab?

1301
01:11:12,328 --> 01:11:14,386
Sure, and I'll call you a cocksucker!

1302
01:11:14,531 --> 01:11:17,294
[Duke Narrating] Of course, I could hear what the clerk was really saying.

1303
01:11:17,434 --> 01:11:20,425
Listen, you fuzzy little shithead!

1304
01:11:20,570 --> 01:11:23,732
I've been fucked around in my time...

1305
01:11:23,907 --> 01:11:26,773
by a fairly good cross section...

1306
01:11:26,910 --> 01:11:29,173
of mean-tempered, rule-crazy cops...

1307
01:11:29,281 --> 01:11:32,443
and now... it's my turn.

1308
01:11:34,351 --> 01:11:38,480
So fuck you, Officer. I'm in charge.

1309
01:11:38,623 --> 01:11:40,487
Hey, listen, I really hate to interrupt,

1310
01:11:40,625 --> 01:11:43,149
but I wonder if I could slide on through.

1311
01:11:43,295 --> 01:11:45,922
The name is Raoul Duke. I think my attorney made the reservations.

1312
01:11:46,065 --> 01:11:48,328
Duke, Raoul.

1313
01:11:48,466 --> 01:11:50,491
- [Bell Dings] - Certainly, sir.

1314
01:11:50,636 --> 01:11:54,571
My bags... My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible there.

1315
01:11:54,707 --> 01:11:56,503
Maybe somebody could bring it to the room for me.

1316
01:11:56,643 --> 01:12:01,012
Oh, yeah, uh, let me get a quart of Wild Turkey...

1317
01:12:01,114 --> 01:12:03,081
- [Arguing Continues] - Two-fifths of Bacardi...

1318
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:05,912
- some ice for the room, and let's see... - You just calm down!

1319
01:12:06,053 --> 01:12:08,145
Shit, let's try some lime chunks. What do you think?

1320
01:12:08,288 --> 01:12:10,687
I say okay.

1321
01:12:10,824 --> 01:12:14,021
- You don't worry about a thing. - Now, calm down.

1322
01:12:14,162 --> 01:12:17,359
You don't hesitate to call me... Sven.

1323
01:12:17,498 --> 01:12:19,362
All right, Sven.

1324
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:22,333
- [Bawling] - Thank you very much.

1325
01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:25,336
- You... You... - I know, I know, I know.

1326
01:12:25,473 --> 01:12:29,067
It's hideous. You're gonna be fine, though. You're doing well.

1327
01:12:29,210 --> 01:12:31,074
I'll see you later. Wait. Don't touch it.

1328
01:12:31,246 --> 01:12:34,237
- [Crying] - Good night. Pardon me. Bye, Sven.

1329
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:39,012
- [Loud Bawling] - Look what you did! Look what you did!

1330
01:12:39,154 --> 01:12:42,782
Goddamn you, we wouldn't stay in this hotel if you begged us!

1331
01:12:42,903 --> 01:12:46,998
# Magic moments #

1332
01:12:47,075 --> 01:12:51,669
# When two hearts are caring #

1333
01:12:51,747 --> 01:12:56,341
- # Magic moments # - [Door Hinges Creak]

1334

1335
01:13:01,645 --> 01:13:03,635
- Whoa. What kind of sick shit... - [Yelling]

1336
01:13:03,814 --> 01:13:06,077
Oh, shit! [Yells]

1337
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:08,114
- Shit. What the fuck? - [Grunting]

1338
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:10,084
Stop, stop, stop.

1339
01:13:10,222 --> 01:13:14,317
Ow! She's biting my leg off! You degenerate pig. Please!

1340
01:13:14,459 --> 01:13:16,085
- [Grunting Continues] - Can't be helped.

1341
01:13:16,229 --> 01:13:20,528
- My fucking leg! - That's "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."

1342
01:13:20,666 --> 01:13:23,657
Lucy, be cool, goddamn it.

1343
01:13:23,803 --> 01:13:27,260
Remember what happened at the airport, okay? Come on.

1344
01:13:30,777 --> 01:13:34,405
No more of that, okay? That's my client, Lucy.

1345
01:13:34,548 --> 01:13:38,450
That's Mr. Duke, the famous journalist.

1346
01:13:38,619 --> 01:13:41,110
He's paying for this suite, Lucy.

1347
01:13:41,255 --> 01:13:43,119
He's on our side.

1348
01:13:43,257 --> 01:13:46,020
He loves artists.

1349
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:50,013
Lucy paints portraits of Barbra Streisand.

1350
01:13:50,113 --> 01:13:53,450
Yeah. Right?

1351
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:56,729
Um, I drew these from TV.

1352
01:13:56,871 --> 01:13:58,929
Really.

1353
01:13:59,074 --> 01:14:02,406
[Gonzo] She came all the way down...

1354
01:14:02,545 --> 01:14:05,069
- What's the name of that town? - Montana.

1355
01:14:05,213 --> 01:14:08,876
Montana. Just to give these portraits to Barbra.

1356
01:14:10,553 --> 01:14:14,216
We're goin' over to the Americana tonight to meet her backstage.

1357
01:14:14,356 --> 01:14:17,256
[Duke Narrating] I desperately needed peace, rest...

1358
01:14:17,426 --> 01:14:19,757
sanctuary.

1359
01:14:19,896 --> 01:14:21,954
I hadn't counted on this:

1360
01:14:22,098 --> 01:14:26,033
Finding my attorney on acid and locked into some kind of preternatural courtship.

1361
01:14:26,085 --> 01:14:28,244
Well...

1362
01:14:28,406 --> 01:14:32,637
they must have, uh, brought the car around by now.

1363
01:14:32,777 --> 01:14:34,676
So...

1364
01:14:34,812 --> 01:14:37,439
why don't, uh...

1365
01:14:37,495 --> 01:14:41,590
ou-yay and... l-ay...

1366
01:14:41,667 --> 01:14:44,998
o-gay and, uh, et-gay the...

1367
01:14:45,071 --> 01:14:47,003
uff-stay...

01:14:47,074 --> 01:14:49,701
out of the unk-tray.

1369
01:14:56,202 --> 01:14:58,227
Absolutely. Yeah.

1370
01:14:58,370 --> 01:15:00,803
Let's get the stuff.

1371
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:03,567
We'll be right back, Lucy.

1372
01:15:03,710 --> 01:15:05,939
- Give me a kiss? One kiss, one kiss. - No.

1373
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:09,344
- No. No. - One kiss. Why not?

1374
01:15:09,482 --> 01:15:11,346
Okay.

1375
01:15:17,025 --> 01:15:19,584
Don't answer the phone.

1376
01:15:26,368 --> 01:15:28,232
God bless.

1377
01:15:28,286 --> 01:15:30,253
[Hinges Creaking]

1378
01:15:30,405 --> 01:15:33,431
[Sighs] Well, what are your plans?

1379
01:15:33,575 --> 01:15:35,701
Plans?

1380
01:15:35,844 --> 01:15:39,244
- The child in the bedroom. - Oh, Lucy.

1381
01:15:39,381 --> 01:15:41,245
I met her on the plane.

1382
01:15:43,853 --> 01:15:47,447
Yeah. She's a religious freak.

1383
01:15:47,590 --> 01:15:50,387
I gave her a cap before I realized...

1384
01:15:50,561 --> 01:15:53,154
Jesus, she's never even had a drink.

1385
01:15:53,297 --> 01:15:55,457
[Duke] Well, it'll probably work out.

1386
01:15:55,598 --> 01:15:58,725
We can keep her loaded, and then peddle her ass at the drug convention.

1387
01:15:58,869 --> 01:16:01,598
Yeah, she's perfect for this gig.

1388
01:16:01,738 --> 01:16:05,765
These cops'll go 50 bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang-fuck her.

1389
01:16:05,909 --> 01:16:08,206
We can set her up in one of these backstreet motels...

1390
01:16:08,346 --> 01:16:12,611
hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, and then turn these fucking pigs loose on her.

1391
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:15,718
Hell, she's strong, man. She'll hold her own.

1392
01:16:17,021 --> 01:16:19,387
Jesus Christ, I knew you were sick...

1393
01:16:19,525 --> 01:16:23,290
but I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff.

1394
01:16:23,462 --> 01:16:27,591
- You filthy bastard. - Straight economics, man. This girl's a godsend.

1395
01:16:27,733 --> 01:16:30,566
Shit. She could make us a grand a day.

1396
01:16:30,703 --> 01:16:33,796
That's ugly, man. Stop talking like that.

1397
01:16:33,940 --> 01:16:37,238
Well, I figure she can do about four at a time.

1398
01:16:37,377 --> 01:16:41,506
If we keep her full of acid, that's more like two grand a day, maybe three.

1399
01:16:41,602 --> 01:16:43,534
[Sinister Chuckling]

1400
01:16:44,651 --> 01:16:46,515
Hold on, man.

1401
01:16:46,653 --> 01:16:49,519
What if I just jump on you and beat the dog shit out of you?

1402
01:16:49,656 --> 01:16:52,351
Would that make you feel any better, you filthy bastard?

1403
01:16:52,493 --> 01:16:54,357
All right, listen to me.

1404
01:16:54,495 --> 01:16:57,258
In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself...

1405
01:16:57,431 --> 01:17:01,230
into some sort of towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection...

1406
01:17:01,335 --> 01:17:04,532

I was polishing my shoes in the closet when I noticed her sneaking in, so I took her.

Don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman.

I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff.

Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.

I swear I'm not. I swear.

- You think you can handle it? - What?

One phone call every day.

Don't worry if it doesn't add up. That's our problem.

But the first time that you say anything about this to anybody...

- Okay. - Just ring Linen Service and ask for Alice.

All right, Alice.

1766

You'll be contacted by Inspector Rock, Arthur Rock.

1767
01:37:29,485 --> 01:37:33,011
He'll be posing as a politician, but you'll have no problem recognizing him.

That's right, Inspector Rock will pay you in cash...

- $1,000 on the ninth of every month. - Oh, Lord!

I'd do just about anything for that.

- You and a lot of other people. - Come here.

The password is: "One hand washes the other."

The minute you hear that, you say, "I fear nothing."

- Say it. - I fear nothing.

Nice meeting you.

Don't bother to make up the room.

1779

Just leave a pile of towels and soap outside the door exactly at midnight.

That way we won't have to risk another one of these little incidents, will we?

Now the son of a bitch owns the circus.

[Laughing] How much you got?

How much do you think you'd take for the ape? Just wait here. I'll be back.

The mentality of Las Vegas is so grossly atavistic...

01:41:53,436 --> 01:41:57,030
that a really massive crime often slips by unrecognized.

You want me to call the cops? I'll call the fuck...

1875
01:44:02,407 --> 01:44:05,569
[Duke] Oh, shit.

1876
01:44:08,747 --> 01:44:10,578
[Duke] Fuck.

1877
01:44:13,018 --> 01:44:15,213
Want me to call the cops?

1878
01:44:30,587 --> 01:44:32,520
[Coughs]

1879
01:44:41,648 --> 01:44:43,843
How much is that lemon meringue pie?

1880
01:44:43,985 --> 01:44:46,885
Her eyes were turgid with fear, but her brain was functioning...

1881
01:44:47,022 --> 01:44:50,219
- on some basic motor survival level. - Thirty-five cents.

1882
01:44:50,324 --> 01:44:53,383
- How much is that lemon meringue pie? - Thirty-five cents.

1883
01:44:53,529 --> 01:44:57,157
Whoo! What a waste of talent.

1884
01:44:57,299 --> 01:45:00,860
No, honey, I mean the whole pie.

1885
01:45:02,672 --> 01:45:04,536
The whole pie.

1886
01:45:07,162 --> 01:45:09,096
- Hmm? - [Gasps]

1887
01:45:16,454 --> 01:45:19,081
What, three?

1888
01:45:24,128 --> 01:45:27,119
Three? Four?

1889
01:45:29,468 --> 01:45:31,435
Five? Hmm?

1890
01:45:31,570 --> 01:45:33,434
Five.

1891
01:45:59,332 --> 01:46:01,527
I'll be in the car.

1892
01:46:14,100 --> 01:46:16,034
[Quiet Sob]

1893
01:46:44,702 --> 01:46:46,636
[Gasps]

1894
01:46:53,712 --> 01:46:56,146
[Engine Starts]

1895
01:46:57,995 --> 01:47:01,259
The sight of the blade had triggered bad memories.

1896
01:47:01,399 --> 01:47:04,492
The glazed look in her eyes said her throat had been cut.

1897
01:47:04,670 --> 01:47:08,037
- She was still in the grip of paralysis when we left. - [Sobbing]

1898
01:47:08,161 --> 01:47:11,096
[Engine Revs]

1899
01:47:11,166 --> 01:47:13,098
[Tires Screeching]

1900
01:47:17,349 --> 01:47:19,509
It was all over now.

1901
01:47:19,651 --> 01:47:22,448
We'd abused every rule that Vegas lived by.

1902
01:47:22,589 --> 01:47:27,821
Threatening the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help.

1903
01:47:27,961 --> 01:47:30,224
The only chance now, I felt...

1904
01:47:30,364 --> 01:47:33,890
was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess...

1905
01:47:34,068 --> 01:47:36,831
that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us...

1906
01:47:36,937 --> 01:47:38,870
could possibly believe it.

1907
01:47:39,039 --> 01:47:41,734
Fifteen minutes to get my attorney to the airport...

1908
01:47:41,875 --> 01:47:44,342
but we'll make it.

1909
01:47:44,478 --> 01:47:47,344
Christ!

1910
01:47:47,482 --> 01:47:50,609
No! Oh, fuck!

1911
01:47:50,752 --> 01:47:53,118
- Fuck. - Whoa, shit! Whoa, shit!

1912
01:47:53,254 --> 01:47:56,245
Oh, God. Oh, God. You son of a bitch!

1913
01:47:56,391 --> 01:47:58,586
Oh, God.

1914
01:47:58,728 --> 01:48:02,755
- [Gonzo] You're going the wrong way. - [Duke] The next left.

1915
01:48:02,898 --> 01:48:05,491
Go! Fuck!

1916
01:48:09,505 --> 01:48:13,201
Take a right here. Take a right here.

1917
01:48:14,143 --> 01:48:18,078


1918
01:48:21,184 --> 01:48:23,981
[Gonzo] Goddamn it. We're lost.

1919
01:48:24,121 --> 01:48:27,852
What are we doing out here on this godforsaken road?

1920
01:48:27,991 --> 01:48:29,855
The airport's over there.

1921
01:48:29,994 --> 01:48:33,451
Goddamn it! It's over there.

1922
01:48:33,598 --> 01:48:36,293
- I've never missed a plane yet. - [Tires Screeching]

1923
01:48:43,868 --> 01:48:45,801
[Horn Honks]

1924
01:48:51,977 --> 01:48:54,706
[Grunting]

1925
01:48:58,958 --> 01:49:01,824
Hold on!

1926
01:49:06,833 --> 01:49:09,357
All right. I'm gonna drop you right next to the plane.

1927
01:49:09,502 --> 01:49:12,368
Fuck you. I'm gonna have to take the blame. They'll crucify me.

1928
01:49:12,540 --> 01:49:14,700
- Right here, right here. - Ridiculous, man.

1929
01:49:14,842 --> 01:49:18,607
Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport, and I picked you up.

1930
01:49:18,746 --> 01:49:21,112
- You bastard. - Get out.

1931
01:49:32,027 --> 01:49:34,017
Hey, hey! Hey, listen.

1932
01:49:34,163 --> 01:49:37,063
Don't take any guff from these swine.

1933
01:49:37,199 --> 01:49:39,894
If you have any trouble, remember:

1934
01:49:40,036 --> 01:49:42,902
You can always send a telegram to the right people.

1935
01:49:43,039 --> 01:49:47,066
Yeah, explaining my position. Some asshole wrote a poem about that once.

1936
01:49:47,210 --> 01:49:50,337
Probably good advice, if you have shit for brains.

1937
01:49:51,443 --> 01:49:53,534
[Wheezing Laugh]

1938
01:49:53,613 --> 01:49:56,047
[Coughing]

1939
01:49:56,120 --> 01:49:58,815
There he goes...

1940
01:49:58,957 --> 01:50:01,481
one of God's own prototypes.

1941
01:50:01,625 --> 01:50:06,084
A high-powered mutant of some kind never even considered for mass production.

1942
01:50:06,231 --> 01:50:09,495
- Too weird to live, and too rare to die. - Ugh!

1943
01:50:30,787 --> 01:50:35,917
# There you stood on the edge of your feather #

1944
01:50:37,194 --> 01:50:41,289
# Expecting to fly #

1945
01:50:44,471 --> 01:50:47,735
We're all wired into a survival trip now.

1946
01:50:49,076 --> 01:50:51,873
No more of the speed that fueled the '60s.

1947
01:50:52,046 --> 01:50:55,072
That was the fatal flaw in Tim Leary's trip.

1948
01:50:55,216 --> 01:50:58,207
He crashed around America, selling "consciousness expansion"...

1949
01:50:58,387 --> 01:51:01,480
without ever giving a thought to the grim meat-hook realities that were lying in wait...

1950
01:51:01,623 --> 01:51:05,080
for all those people who took him seriously.

1951
01:51:05,227 --> 01:51:07,422
All those pathetically eager acid freaks...

1952
01:51:07,563 --> 01:51:11,430
who thought they could buy peace and understanding for three bucks a hit.

1953
01:51:11,567 --> 01:51:14,091
But their loss and failure...

1954
01:51:14,237 --> 01:51:16,761
is ours too.

1955
01:51:16,905 --> 01:51:19,771
What Leary took down with him was the central illusion of a whole lifestyle...

1956
01:51:19,909 --> 01:51:22,001
that he helped create.

1957
01:51:22,145 --> 01:51:24,442
A generation of permanent cripples...

1958
01:51:24,581 --> 01:51:26,480
failed seekers...

1959
01:51:26,617 --> 01:51:30,882
who never understood the essential old-mystic fallacy of the acid culture:

1960
01:51:30,988 --> 01:51:33,888
The desperate assumption that somebody...

1961
01:51:34,058 --> 01:51:35,957
or at least some force...

1962
01:51:36,093 --> 01:51:38,788
is tending the light at the end of the tunnel.

1963
01:51:41,165 --> 01:51:45,100


1964
01:51:45,871 --> 01:51:48,134
There was only one road back to L.A.

1965
01:51:48,273 --> 01:51:51,207
U.S. Interstate 15.

1966
01:51:51,344 --> 01:51:55,211
Just a flat out high-speed burn through Baker and Barstow and Berdoo.

1967
01:51:55,348 --> 01:51:57,872
Then onto the Hollywood Freeway, straight into frantic oblivion...

1968
01:51:58,016 --> 01:52:00,245
safety, obscurity.

1969
01:52:00,387 --> 01:52:03,446
Just another freak... in the freak kingdom.
