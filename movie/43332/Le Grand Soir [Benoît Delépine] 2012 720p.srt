1
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,200
The Big Night.

3
00:01:41,804 --> 00:01:43,442
<i>Hey, Not, where are you going?</i>

4
00:01:43,757 --> 00:01:44,810
Do you care?

5
00:03:54,261 --> 00:03:55,222
There it is.

6
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,090
You know <i> understand me...</i>

7
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:10,336
<i>I love you,
my mommy, I love you...</i>

8
00:04:11,037 --> 00:04:15,010
<i>Even when the day will come,
your first white hair...</i>

9
00:04:15,411 --> 00:04:19,144
I'll look <i> yet
like a little boy...</i>

10
00:04:21,545 --> 00:04:22,324
It's me!

11
00:04:26,195 --> 00:04:30,995
<i>Unintelligible.</i>

12
00:05:08,635 --> 00:05:09,397
It's just a matter of money.

13
00:05:09,398 --> 00:05:11,755
Take it or not.
I'm not telling you to lend me money for.

14
00:05:11,756 --> 00:05:12,656
Depends on what you want.

15
00:05:12,657 --> 00:05:13,657
<i>Unintelligible.</i>

16
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,546
With 3 or 4%, you can get the Panasonic,
a bit more expensive it is true...

17
00:05:31,547 --> 00:05:34,308
But credit will lasts longer,
understand how important it is?

18
00:05:34,309 --> 00:05:37,916
And surrond, whatever they say,
you still have the Dolby Stereo,

19
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:39,456
But it's really something surrond
completely envelops.

20
00:05:39,457 --> 00:05:42,670
It can be up to 23 +1,
23 +1! You see?

21
00:05:42,671 --> 00:05:45,270
Do you call this bird,
which is kept in a single leg?

22
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:49,378
I think it's a flamingo,
but not a flamenco...

23
00:05:51,778 --> 00:05:54,169
They are birds
live in Africa...

24
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,050
We had seen a few in a
Lille zoo...

25
00:05:57,062 --> 00:05:58,498
Remember Dad?

26
00:05:58,499 --> 00:06:01,109
We had seen some Zoo in Lille.

27
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,935
Remember? We had a beer,

28
00:06:03,936 --> 00:06:06,625
And you said, "Look, it's going to fall".

29
00:06:07,026 --> 00:06:10,934
Moreover these birds,
than those seen in the gardens.

30
00:06:11,335 --> 00:06:15,871
And so,
I have the entire right leg,

31
00:06:15,872 --> 00:06:17,172
Very hard because...

32
00:06:21,373 --> 00:06:22,840
It depends on what you watch,
true.

33
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:25,665
"Who wants to be a millionaire?"
remains more or less true.

34
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:28,030
To change a car race,
if it's bad, you do not see the cars.

35
00:06:30,132 --> 00:06:33,197
The point is that if the sound
completely surrounds you, you're happy.

36
00:06:33,198 --> 00:06:35,020
With perfect surrond, know?

37
00:06:35,021 --> 00:06:36,321
It's just a matter of money.

38
00:06:36,322 --> 00:06:38,829
But between 13,000 and 15,000,
the difference is not so great.

39
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,906
What do you think?

40
00:06:39,907 --> 00:06:41,400
I, in any case,
I have no money.

41
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,486
But if I ask for a loan,
Yes I will have!

42
00:06:43,587 --> 00:06:46,248
Understand?
Only 3-4% more, nothing else.

43
00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:48,584
And seeing as the sound surrounds you,
worth.

44
00:07:00,001 --> 00:07:03,985
To define age...
Press button No. 2...

45
00:07:05,798 --> 00:07:09,445
With finger... many times...
as years...

46
00:07:09,446 --> 00:07:11,244
You want.

47
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,360
Dad do not look good.

48
00:07:14,807 --> 00:07:18,388
I'm fine, as a type,
still working...

49
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:23,077
When their children,
would have to pay for retirement.

50
00:07:23,478 --> 00:07:24,469
Not only this.

51
00:07:26,174 --> 00:07:27,519
Not rather, your back pain?

52
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,538
No?

53
00:07:30,055 --> 00:07:31,635
It is the disease of the century!

54
00:07:31,636 --> 00:07:33,678
Sometimes
can be for something very simple.

55
00:07:34,196 --> 00:07:35,548
A bad mattress...

56
00:07:35,549 --> 00:07:36,830
A bad mattress...

57
00:07:38,522 --> 00:07:41,269
You know I have to change mattress
least every five years?

58
00:07:42,892 --> 00:07:44,988
Jean-Pierre... for.

59
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:47,334
Ok. I understand.

60
00:07:47,335 --> 00:07:49,521
Do not talk about work.

61
00:07:49,822 --> 00:07:52,700
Of course with Ben,
to talk about work...

62
00:07:52,801 --> 00:07:55,129
Do not call me that. Ok?

63
00:07:55,364 --> 00:07:57,656
Nobody called me that in 15 years.

64
00:07:57,657 --> 00:07:59,457
Here! My Name is Not.

65
00:08:00,597 --> 00:08:02,494
Not! I forgot, Not!

66
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:08,985
Not? Okay,
you can go get your mother.

67
00:08:08,986 --> 00:08:09,986
Ok.

68
00:08:10,787 --> 00:08:11,877
Mom!

69
00:08:12,178 --> 00:08:13,753
Coming!

70
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,201
Met <i> happy...</i>

71
00:08:29,202 --> 00:08:31,511
Met <i> happy...</i>

72
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:34,914
Met <i> happy Lord, Lady...</i>

73
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:37,609
Met <i> happy!</i>

74
00:08:38,873 --> 00:08:43,091
We can no longer hold real candles,
by the new safety standards.

75
00:08:47,773 --> 00:08:48,849
Happy Birthday Mom!

76
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,118
Happy Birthday Mom!
Happy Birthday!

77
00:08:59,111 --> 00:09:00,251
Thank you.

78
00:09:00,829 --> 00:09:04,636
I dislike... well... birthdays.

79
00:09:06,237 --> 00:09:07,167
Bravo!

80
00:09:09,402 --> 00:09:11,112
I know it is annoying
for all...

81
00:09:11,113 --> 00:09:13,607
But you have to respect rules today
we are not in the Middle Ages.

82
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,950
And he criticizes, criticizes...

83
00:09:15,951 --> 00:09:18,229
But not for nothing,
if life expectancy increases.

84
00:09:20,155 --> 00:09:23,277
Hey, I'm on the street daily.

85
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:26,990
I searched,
but I've never seen life expectancy!

86
00:09:26,991 --> 00:09:28,256
For, I know your speech.

87
00:09:28,257 --> 00:09:30,331
I guess for you,
this is the enemy?

88
00:09:30,332 --> 00:09:33,588
But notice that there are thousands
of people who come here every day.

89
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:35,073
And not just because it is cheaper...

90
00:09:35,811 --> 00:09:37,039
But because there is life!

91
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,990
- Life?
- Yes.

92
00:09:38,868 --> 00:09:40,478
Hot for Summer
heat for the winter...

93
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:42,426
- And round security.
- Ah, the safety!

94
00:09:42,461 --> 00:09:45,391
It is one of the few places in the world,
where you can walk in regulated buildings...

95
00:09:45,392 --> 00:09:46,292
With people regulated...

96
00:09:46,293 --> 00:09:47,896
Surrounded regulated products.

97
00:09:50,244 --> 00:09:51,890
And your stupidity,
be regulated?

98
00:09:54,747 --> 00:09:56,010
That is easy.

99
00:09:58,923 --> 00:10:01,105
It'll take you.
I guess you have your pride.

100
00:11:07,032 --> 00:11:08,130
Yes?

101
00:11:08,131 --> 00:11:09,578
Safety place.

102
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:11,791
What are you doing here?

103
00:11:12,092 --> 00:11:14,072
- Eh?
- What are you doing here?

104
00:11:15,073 --> 00:11:17,273
- I need to rest.
- With the dog?

105
00:11:17,274 --> 00:11:18,174
Yes.

106
00:11:18,837 --> 00:11:19,987
What is race?

107
00:11:21,591 --> 00:11:23,279
- A pastor punk.
- Eh?

108
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,681
A pastor punk.

109
00:11:26,177 --> 00:11:27,404
It has English blood?

110
00:11:27,981 --> 00:11:30,264
- What?
- If the pastor has English blood punk?

111
00:11:30,265 --> 00:11:32,253
I think yes.

112
00:11:32,254 --> 00:11:35,013
- Having English blood, is to have class!
- Yes

113
00:11:35,048 --> 00:11:38,138
I hope your dog will have enough class
not to shit in the house.

114
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,378
- Yes.
- Yes?

115
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:40,500
- Promise?
- Yes.

116
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,823
Good night.

117
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,682
How <i> not enough orange?</i>

118
00:11:56,822 --> 00:11:59,919
<i>Course is orange,
I checked with the color catalog.</i>

119
00:12:03,261 --> 00:12:06,415
Is the orange <i> Grand Litter, right?</i>

120
00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:11,579
<i>Orange is orange,
Check the graphic card.</i>

121
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:12,916
<i>Will see which is the corresponding orange.</i>

122
00:12:12,917 --> 00:12:14,953
<i>Nothing to do with the Orange.</i>

123
00:12:14,954 --> 00:12:17,298
It is much more orange <i>
the orange of Orange.</i>

124
00:12:19,891 --> 00:12:23,624
<i>Well, now I have no time,
come rebates and...</i>

125
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,991
<i>I have clients who are waiting.
Ok?</i>

126
00:12:27,805 --> 00:12:30,981
<i>Well, talk to you later,
it later.</i>

127
00:12:33,597 --> 00:12:36,867
Bonzini?
I have to say something.

128
00:12:37,268 --> 00:12:38,735
He had a good weekend,
Mr. Director?

129
00:12:38,936 --> 00:12:42,423
- Bonzini?
- Yes, Sir.

130
00:12:42,424 --> 00:12:44,051
Bonzini are behind.

131
00:12:44,052 --> 00:12:45,995
I have problems with my daughter,
found no nanny.

132
00:12:45,996 --> 00:12:49,024
No, you are behind your target,
very late.

133
00:12:49,025 --> 00:12:50,712
And the assessment meeting is
after tomorrow.

134
00:12:51,315 --> 00:12:55,143
It Bonzini crisis.
Some are not made to survive.

135
00:12:55,965 --> 00:12:57,846
They are easily recognized,
Bonzini.

136
00:12:58,474 --> 00:13:00,293
Are overdue.

137
00:13:31,347 --> 00:13:33,307
Oh, enough, enough!

138
00:13:33,808 --> 00:13:34,907
What are you doing here?

139
00:13:36,842 --> 00:13:37,691
What are you doing here?

140
00:13:38,343 --> 00:13:41,613
Ando cart.
Do not shout so scared the dog.

141
00:13:41,614 --> 00:13:43,794
Ando cart.
8.6 ° to walk some shopping?

142
00:13:44,234 --> 00:13:47,967
You who know,
know where the shelf "beers and pellets"?

143
00:13:47,968 --> 00:13:50,457
- Do not tease me.
- I kid you not.

144
00:13:52,885 --> 00:13:54,698
I was thinking about what you said.

145
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:57,490
People come here,
because life comes for.

146
00:13:57,491 --> 00:13:59,344
Sleeping,
I thought you were right.

147
00:13:59,345 --> 00:14:02,192
They come to get some cold,
in hot...

148
00:14:02,393 --> 00:14:04,982
Some heat, when it's cold...

149
00:14:04,983 --> 00:14:06,687
And I thought: that's okay!

150
00:14:06,688 --> 00:14:08,987
Because I would be the only fool
to stay in the center?

151
00:14:08,988 --> 00:14:10,720
So I came to buy, you see.

152
00:14:10,721 --> 00:14:13,312
- I warn Benoit, if...
- Hey ..

153
00:14:13,313 --> 00:14:16,067
Not. My name is Benoit,
Not my name is important.

154
00:14:16,268 --> 00:14:20,359
If you mess, do not care if you are my
brother, call immediately to security.

155
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,343
Understand?

156
00:14:22,405 --> 00:14:25,085
- Is that clear?
- Yes, I am not of this kind.

157
00:14:25,086 --> 00:14:27,003
- Entered into your head, understand?
- Yes.

158
00:14:27,004 --> 00:14:30,329
If you mess-up.
I do not care that you're my brother.

159
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:32,831
These are the rules,
this is the norm.

160
00:14:33,014 --> 00:14:35,674
I give a shit about the brother.
Security soon!

161
00:14:35,676 --> 00:14:37,287
- Yeah, no problem.
- Dress the guard?

162
00:14:37,288 --> 00:14:39,700
Care. I do not care. A call.

163
00:14:40,101 --> 00:14:41,184
Vale.

164
00:14:44,412 --> 00:14:46,924
It is a very technical,
called "smart foam"...

165
00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:49,086
Fits every inch
its silhouette...

166
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:52,357
Which means total comfort,
and sleep for granted.

167
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,292
Look... Squeeze...

168
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:59,089
The foam takes the form,
and returns to its initial position.

169
00:14:59,556 --> 00:15:03,351
Look: fix, takes the form,
and the same again.

170
00:15:03,352 --> 00:15:05,672
Look: bind, now very strong...

171
00:15:05,673 --> 00:15:08,874
It takes the form,
and the same again.

172
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:12,357
I do not care.
I did not come to that.

173
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,699
And what came then?

174
00:15:15,113 --> 00:15:16,721
Need bedding?

175
00:15:16,722 --> 00:15:19,088
I come to test the mattresses...

176
00:15:19,745 --> 00:15:21,375
Taking references...

177
00:15:21,376 --> 00:15:23,321
The brands, prices...

178
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:27,125
So I come home,
buy it online...

179
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:28,519
But cheaper.

180
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,813
I see.

181
00:15:29,814 --> 00:15:32,713
You know what we do?
You're going to go.

182
00:15:33,852 --> 00:15:35,241
I'm staying.

183
00:15:36,088 --> 00:15:37,427
You go.

184
00:15:38,692 --> 00:15:40,203
I'm staying.

185
00:15:41,521 --> 00:15:42,143
Standing.

186
00:15:43,378 --> 00:15:46,046
No. I'm staying.

187
00:15:51,605 --> 00:15:53,360
Do not bother and go.

188
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,553
No.

189
00:16:10,605 --> 00:16:12,658
Yes, that's right.

190
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:13,926
Listen.

191
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,870
Listen to me please
is important.

192
00:16:20,982 --> 00:16:24,149
I'll have to leave
a little here.

193
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,150
I hear?

194
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,585
Because where I'm going,
do not accept dogs.

195
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:28,586
They are fools.

196
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:33,254
Here you are safe, is a roundabout
the safest place in the world.

197
00:16:33,255 --> 00:16:36,150
You will not have bad encounters,
is no longer a little noisy.

198
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:41,355
I leave a few pellets.

199
00:16:43,165 --> 00:16:44,140
That's it.

200
00:16:44,341 --> 00:16:46,064
And if you're thirsty...

201
00:16:49,351 --> 00:16:50,855
Since I opened...

202
00:16:50,856 --> 00:16:53,254
You push with your leg,
and lean...

203
00:16:53,255 --> 00:16:54,255
So, okay?

204
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:56,444
That's it.

205
00:16:59,316 --> 00:17:02,149
Do not get mad. Do not get mad.

206
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:04,539
It takes courage.
We are a family of two.

207
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,979
I will be back soon, okay?
Give me a kiss.

208
00:17:09,908 --> 00:17:11,023
I'm going!

209
00:17:12,095 --> 00:17:14,198
Do not eat all the pellets,
than once!

210
00:17:14,985 --> 00:17:17,650
No, do not do this.

211
00:17:17,651 --> 00:17:19,994
Be back soon, be back soon,
do not worry!

212
00:17:23,651 --> 00:17:25,875
Enough, I feel sorry,
I will return!

213
00:18:47,787 --> 00:18:49,187
Yes, honey, it's me.

214
00:18:50,305 --> 00:18:53,890
Called to say I have to go
coproprietarios a meeting of...

215
00:18:53,891 --> 00:18:55,823
And also tell you...

216
00:18:56,762 --> 00:19:00,595
I'm not stalking you.
I call quiet, no pressure.

217
00:19:00,996 --> 00:19:03,140
I understood that for now,
rather be alone.

218
00:19:05,351 --> 00:19:07,819
I swear I'm in my normal state,
I promise.

219
00:19:10,614 --> 00:19:11,892
Do not get angry.

220
00:19:12,093 --> 00:19:14,355
I'm talking normally,
or am I angry?

221
00:19:14,356 --> 00:19:16,219
Do not get angry.

222
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,977
For I tell you. I'm not angry,
for!

223
00:19:21,852 --> 00:19:23,903
But... To!

224
00:19:23,904 --> 00:19:26,537
Listen to me! I need to talk,
listen to me!

225
00:19:33,009 --> 00:19:35,184
What? But you!

226
00:19:35,185 --> 00:19:36,737
It's you! It's your fault!

227
00:19:36,738 --> 00:19:39,659
They are so used to come.
Always running...

228
00:19:39,694 --> 00:19:42,171
Because obviously no internet,
all you want...

229
00:19:42,206 --> 00:19:43,971
In short, it's your problem,
not mine...

230
00:19:44,006 --> 00:19:46,918
But I will say frankly:

231
00:19:47,446 --> 00:19:50,147
We must take the time
look at this...

232
00:19:50,182 --> 00:19:53,925
Because if seen after
you can eat as much as restaurant...

233
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,522
After shopping,
to account, it is our money.

234
00:19:56,757 --> 00:19:57,937
It's true!

235
00:19:57,972 --> 00:19:59,499
Yes, yes.

236
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,857
- Yes there are benefits on purchases...
- It's true...

237
00:20:02,858 --> 00:20:05,254
Now, this is good to go to the bathroom.

238
00:20:07,109 --> 00:20:08,335
It seems...

239
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,844
- Well, we...
- I wanted to ask...

240
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:14,211
- What is your name?
- Not.

241
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,931
I wanted to ask...

242
00:20:17,602 --> 00:20:20,089
He spoke of a drink,
or eating something...

243
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,697
Maybe we can make something...

244
00:20:22,298 --> 00:20:23,918
- Not now!
- Why?

245
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,414
When you finish shopping.

246
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,184
Then I finish shopping,
and I can...

247
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:29,349
Yes, of course!

248
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:32,049
I can choose my beer?

249
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:34,436
Sure if you want, why not we.

250
00:20:34,537 --> 00:20:35,940
Because for example, I...

251
00:20:35,994 --> 00:20:38,859
No, it means,
more time to take her home.

252
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,922
Or we can take together...

253
00:20:40,923 --> 00:20:42,029
Of course.

254
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,911
Personally...

255
00:20:43,912 --> 00:20:45,061
Look, here are the shelves...

256
00:20:45,062 --> 00:20:48,590
I did not want to go to the
shelves of alcohol, is chance...

257
00:20:48,591 --> 00:20:50,423
This is the same...

258
00:20:50,572 --> 00:20:53,642
I realized with bottles...

259
00:20:53,942 --> 00:20:55,934
From appetizer, or anything...

260
00:20:57,076 --> 00:20:59,227
That decreased the dose!

261
00:20:59,228 --> 00:21:01,346
Alcohol? I'll tell you.

262
00:21:01,381 --> 00:21:04,265
No, not of Alcohol,
I talk about the amount.

263
00:21:04,266 --> 00:21:05,549
The amount...

264
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:08,717
So instead of 1 liter,
There are 3/4.

265
00:21:09,805 --> 00:21:12,367
- They're unhappy...
- Sure!

266
00:21:12,402 --> 00:21:14,425
Look, all there!

267
00:21:15,937 --> 00:21:18,239
Well, that's...
And what is this?

268
00:21:19,796 --> 00:21:21,504
Here... eh...

269
00:21:21,805 --> 00:21:24,139
There are many options here!

270
00:21:25,126 --> 00:21:27,192
I was not expecting that.

271
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,766
I've never seen that.

272
00:21:31,352 --> 00:21:32,388
From this, take me.

273
00:21:32,395 --> 00:21:34,371
Yes, wait... I'm seeing if...

274
00:21:34,372 --> 00:21:36,584
From this, take me.
And it's super...

275
00:21:36,885 --> 00:21:38,640
Because there is the same with...

276
00:21:38,641 --> 00:21:40,240
Not the with...

277
00:21:40,275 --> 00:21:42,596
- The old cap, you know?
- Yes, yes, look...

278
00:21:42,597 --> 00:21:45,140
How convenient!
It seems very intelligent.

279
00:21:45,641 --> 00:21:47,924
But with...

280
00:21:48,025 --> 00:21:50,125
The old bottle...

281
00:21:50,126 --> 00:21:53,020
The new caps, and will not gas.

282
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:53,881
Yes, that's right.

283
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:56,178
It's cheaper. I took it.

284
00:21:56,179 --> 00:21:58,942
I give 6 then. Give me 3?

285
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:00,460
Yeah, okay.

286
00:22:01,161 --> 00:22:04,310
We deserved it.

287
00:22:50,197 --> 00:22:52,971
The carousel <i> the City</i>

288
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:57,083
I <i> smiles City...</i>

289
00:22:59,323 --> 00:23:01,245
Mom, have to do me a favor.

290
00:23:05,244 --> 00:23:08,720
Sorry but I'm with the girl,
and I can take to the store ..

291
00:23:09,838 --> 00:23:12,167
- But it can not be!
- Yes, you can be a mom...

292
00:23:12,168 --> 00:23:15,763
- So it was really...
- Mom, I beg you, you have to...

293
00:23:15,764 --> 00:23:17,741
- Mom, look at me...
- But how disgusting!

294
00:23:17,742 --> 00:23:20,057
- Disgusting!
- I have to do a favor.

295
00:23:20,058 --> 00:23:22,024
I have a little girl, I can not take with me...
Mom, listen to me!

296
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,458
Listen to me, listen to me!

297
00:23:23,459 --> 00:23:26,344
You see? Pregnant... at age 54!

298
00:23:26,345 --> 00:23:28,642
I understand mom is wrong,
but I'm in serious trouble...

299
00:23:28,643 --> 00:23:30,522
You have to care for the girl.

300
00:23:30,523 --> 00:23:32,271
I can not take to the store.
This is no time.

301
00:23:32,306 --> 00:23:34,191
- Understand?
- But...

302
00:23:34,192 --> 00:23:36,923
We also is our day off!

303
00:23:38,158 --> 00:23:40,139
- Come on!
- I do not know how!

304
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,378
Sure, you did us...

305
00:23:43,379 --> 00:23:46,620
Well, thanks... I leave it... I call.
Take care of the girl!

306
00:23:47,521 --> 00:23:52,536
Jean-Pierre!
I'm not your mother!

307
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:41,458
Salgo two minutes. Two minutes.

308
00:25:41,459 --> 00:25:44,432
I... eh...

309
00:26:16,465 --> 00:26:17,993
Didier, you copy?

310
00:26:18,294 --> 00:26:19,348
Yes, I hear you.

311
00:26:20,498 --> 00:26:24,232
There is a suspicious individual in
the gallery n ° 2. You can go see?

312
00:26:24,733 --> 00:26:26,243
Ok, I will.

313
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,316
Thank you.

314
00:26:30,758 --> 00:26:32,062
Okay, I'm watching.

315
00:26:33,828 --> 00:26:35,581
Follow it.

316
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:37,283
Come!

317
00:26:41,763 --> 00:26:43,460
Jean speaks, for Central...

318
00:26:43,461 --> 00:26:44,655
Forward.

319
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,485
I have nothing now,
in the fire via...

320
00:26:47,486 --> 00:26:49,628
You can go see?
Someone pushing a shopping weird...

321
00:26:49,663 --> 00:26:51,871
- You'll see and tell me?
- Ok, I will.

322
00:26:51,872 --> 00:26:53,383
Ok, thanks.

323
00:26:55,549 --> 00:26:57,344
Usually, I see.

324
00:26:57,545 --> 00:27:00,073
What is? Are cheese or what?

325
00:27:00,074 --> 00:27:02,998
Right, are cheeses.

326
00:27:03,969 --> 00:27:06,911
Ok... Stay with an eye on.

327
00:27:07,601 --> 00:27:08,688
Affirmative.

328
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:11,838
Have a penny?

329
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,237
Bourgeois!

330
00:27:15,238 --> 00:27:16,635
Comes organic, eh?

331
00:27:16,936 --> 00:27:20,695
Eat organic the bourgeois!
And your cancer will also be organic!

332
00:27:20,896 --> 00:27:23,061
And for chemo, I advise
the supermarket La Chinita!

333
00:27:30,587 --> 00:27:32,092
You are very tired, you.

334
00:27:32,093 --> 00:27:34,310
Look, look at them!

335
00:27:35,811 --> 00:27:38,336
Look at the fat there,
the chubby look.

336
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:41,030
Gordinflonita...

337
00:27:41,031 --> 00:27:43,914
It has a coin for the dog,
is having surgery...

338
00:27:45,952 --> 00:27:48,275
They will operate the dog,
have a penny?

339
00:27:48,276 --> 00:27:49,904
No, it has nothing...

340
00:27:50,305 --> 00:27:54,090
Eat, eat, eat...
They eat "light" and...

341
00:27:54,691 --> 00:27:57,952
Go to mourn in your cereal,
Porky!

342
00:28:00,908 --> 00:28:03,627
Dress? They eat "light"
but eat 10 times more!

343
00:28:05,068 --> 00:28:06,724
Pigs!

344
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,175
This means no?

345
00:28:17,376 --> 00:28:20,277
We sell things all year, but...

346
00:28:20,578 --> 00:28:22,807
It would be good also buy something,
from time to time!

347
00:28:53,496 --> 00:28:56,336
- I'm sick, I'm sick.
- No, get out of the car!

348
00:28:56,337 --> 00:28:58,333
Out of the car, come on! Hurry!

349
00:28:58,396 --> 00:29:01,364
- I left to shop?
- Yes, but out of the car, hurry!

350
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:03,149
- Ah! I'm very bad.
- Lie, and out of the car!

351
00:29:03,184 --> 00:29:04,790
- Bought yogurt?
- No, no.

352
00:29:06,163 --> 00:29:08,346
I go if I get a yogurt.

353
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:11,003
- And for the dog pellets?
- No, no more yogurt.

354
00:29:11,177 --> 00:29:12,651
- Look, what evil is.
- Bullshit!

355
00:29:13,792 --> 00:29:16,088
- Only for the dog pellets.
- Are you crazy!

356
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:18,416
Now get out. I take a yogurt.

357
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:22,987
You're crazy!

358
00:29:26,213 --> 00:29:27,776
I can take a little...

359
00:29:31,216 --> 00:29:34,350
What did you see?
What shameless!

360
00:29:35,735 --> 00:29:38,277
- I can not believe!
- Me neither.

361
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:40,168
Agent Central gallery.

362
00:29:40,469 --> 00:29:41,684
Forward.

363
00:29:42,611 --> 00:29:44,448
There's a guy in the gallery...

364
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,869
Sounds like a salesman...
is very rare...

365
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:49,354
It seems a little angry.

366
00:29:49,355 --> 00:29:51,011
You can go and see what happens?

367
00:29:51,012 --> 00:29:54,038
Take an object
a suspicious package...

368
00:29:54,239 --> 00:29:55,687
I fail to see what is...

369
00:29:55,811 --> 00:29:58,308
Okay, I'll check and find out.

370
00:29:58,409 --> 00:29:59,894
Appreciate it.

371
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,208
Go ahead, I'm listening.

372
00:30:03,209 --> 00:30:06,049
I'm in the place.
Indeed, he is very angry...

373
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:09,969
It addresses all customers.
I'll see what happens.

374
00:30:14,506 --> 00:30:16,006
A baby, please.

375
00:30:19,383 --> 00:30:21,340
- Ice?
- Yes.

376
00:30:27,516 --> 00:30:28,796
Thank you.

377
00:30:44,337 --> 00:30:46,764
Good morning.
I hear your order.

378
00:30:46,765 --> 00:30:50,621
I do not come to this.
I come to retrieve a girl...

379
00:30:50,622 --> 00:30:52,936
That will have to be stopped.

380
00:30:52,937 --> 00:30:55,199
I think it is further,
section deliveries.

381
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,146
In deliveries?

382
00:30:57,547 --> 00:30:59,112
Come.

383
00:31:00,015 --> 00:31:01,494
Nothing to do.

384
00:31:01,495 --> 00:31:02,938
He had said.

385
00:31:02,973 --> 00:31:06,250
It becomes totally crazy,
irresponsible...

386
00:31:06,251 --> 00:31:08,022
It is the second window.

387
00:31:08,313 --> 00:31:11,435
I believe if I tell you
never eat a hamburger?

388
00:31:12,381 --> 00:31:14,937
Menu "Giant", right?

389
00:31:14,938 --> 00:31:19,561
No, I am a girl who have
have let in a little red.

390
00:31:19,562 --> 00:31:21,564
Ah, are you?

391
00:31:21,565 --> 00:31:24,184
Nothing to do. Awesome.

392
00:31:24,219 --> 00:31:27,484
Thank you. Excuse me.

393
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:31,254
It's a shame. The last time, my
mother left her in a landfill.

394
00:31:31,355 --> 00:31:32,627
Sorry.

395
00:31:33,428 --> 00:31:36,483
My affection.
It's over, finished.

396
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:41,562
Ms know: perhaps lived more things today
you throughout your life.

397
00:31:42,882 --> 00:31:45,003
Finished my love.

398
00:31:45,004 --> 00:31:48,552
Mr. Attorney, if all this I have no
tuition, no longer understand anything.

399
00:31:51,477 --> 00:31:53,677
- Smells rich chips!
- What?

400
00:31:56,318 --> 00:32:00,549
Come here!
Come, do not be silly!

401
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:04,496
Do not get dumber than the product!
It's called smart foam.

402
00:32:04,497 --> 00:32:06,066
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand!

403
00:32:06,067 --> 00:32:08,760
- Let me alone!
- I appreciate!

404
00:32:12,645 --> 00:32:14,241
Look, look!

405
00:33:08,077 --> 00:33:09,366
No!

406
00:33:09,867 --> 00:33:11,624
Bonzini?

407
00:33:13,778 --> 00:33:18,551
I know it does not achieve,
but from there to linger, is exaggerated.

408
00:33:18,552 --> 00:33:20,446
Do not want to see more Bonzini.

409
00:33:20,847 --> 00:33:24,482
No way.
5 years ago I started working here.

410
00:33:24,517 --> 00:33:25,724
Do not exaggerate.

411
00:33:25,851 --> 00:33:27,885
- We accept your resignation, Bonzini.
- What?

412
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,739
I quit? Who you think I am?

413
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,622
I want my compensation,
my unemployment insurance.

414
00:33:42,302 --> 00:33:44,752
Yesterday afternoon,
Been there?

415
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,288
This is nonsense. What is this?

416
00:33:49,489 --> 00:33:51,701
It's not me.

417
00:33:52,002 --> 00:33:54,742
Are modified images...

418
00:33:57,436 --> 00:34:00,140
He says many rude,
and I say very few.

419
00:34:00,141 --> 00:34:02,626
<i>Enough Bonzini.</i>

420
00:34:03,327 --> 00:34:05,849
Wait <i> scores a goal bastard!</i>

421
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:11,458
Where is this?

422
00:34:11,459 --> 00:34:13,507
<i>Course I'm going to leave
your fucking job!</i>

423
00:34:13,508 --> 00:34:15,561
<i>Well, resigns if not happy!</i>

424
00:34:15,562 --> 00:34:17,066
It was a joke.

425
00:34:20,378 --> 00:34:24,025
<i>Waive this shit work...</i>

426
00:34:24,026 --> 00:34:25,026
Jean-Pierre <i> Bonzini.</i>

427
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:29,551
It's silly.

428
00:34:29,852 --> 00:34:31,841
It is sufficient, or do I?

429
00:34:32,433 --> 00:34:35,272
Renouncing <i> this shitty job,
Jean-Pierre Bonzini.</i>

430
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:40,564
It was a joke. It's absurd.
I did a little party and...

431
00:34:41,104 --> 00:34:42,603
Goodbye, Bonzini.

432
00:36:41,278 --> 00:36:43,359
I had a dream, 8.6 °.

433
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:49,644
No figurabas.
I do not like this.

434
00:36:51,813 --> 00:36:54,080
I do not like.

435
00:36:54,081 --> 00:36:56,289
I did not sleep enough.

436
00:37:03,069 --> 00:37:04,219
A coffee.

437
00:37:48,247 --> 00:37:50,326
Baila, soft legs.

438
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,282
Not feeling well, Bonzini?

439
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:58,921
I want my job.

440
00:37:59,022 --> 00:38:00,529
It's too late.

441
00:38:00,982 --> 00:38:03,285
Look there in his office...

442
00:38:03,286 --> 00:38:06,529
It Dupillon Renald,
the son of the founder of Grand Litter.

443
00:38:39,441 --> 00:38:42,447
I would like to open an account
for my daughter: Audrey Bonzini.

444
00:38:42,448 --> 00:38:43,941
It has 8 months.

445
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,244
How much to give?

446
00:38:46,945 --> 00:38:50,145
An initial deposit of 100 euros,
and then 10% of my salary.

447
00:38:50,146 --> 00:38:52,638
Now I'm like "pause"
so are 20 euros each month.

448
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:56,397
- There is nothing I see in your account.
- What?

449
00:38:56,398 --> 00:38:58,328
But I have 3000 euros in my account.

450
00:38:58,663 --> 00:39:01,220
Yes, but there were several twists.

451
00:39:01,221 --> 00:39:04,287
17h48: 610 euros for shoes...

452
00:39:04,288 --> 00:39:07,770
18h12: 348 euros a hairdresser...

453
00:39:07,805 --> 00:39:10,619
From new shoes for 426 euros...

454
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:15,493
Then, bodybuilding perineum
in a gym for 769 euros...

455
00:39:16,867 --> 00:39:21,478
1499 euros for a "Black and White
Adventures" in the Dominican Republic...

456
00:39:24,256 --> 00:39:27,590
And automatic transfers
10 euros monthly Tricot Foundation.

457
00:39:29,186 --> 00:39:31,656
His wife is not quite right
lately.

458
00:39:32,935 --> 00:39:35,143
Between us: never have
joint bank account...

459
00:39:35,144 --> 00:39:37,146
Love has to save some mystery.

460
00:42:40,797 --> 00:42:45,110
<i>What can you do now?
You can do nothing, eh?</i>

461
00:42:47,511 --> 00:42:49,532
<i>Do not bother me!</i>

462
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:30,876
Yes!

463
00:44:04,128 --> 00:44:05,751
Son of...

464
00:44:08,188 --> 00:44:09,487
Son of...

465
00:44:09,488 --> 00:44:11,434
Son of...

466
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,397
Daughter of...

467
00:44:15,265 --> 00:44:16,643
Grandson of...

468
00:44:17,733 --> 00:44:18,840
Son of...

469
00:44:20,518 --> 00:44:23,988
Today, if you're the son of someone famous,
You can not achieve anything.

470
00:44:24,738 --> 00:44:27,235
I do not know why I bother
in making curriculum.

471
00:44:31,381 --> 00:44:33,219
I am the son of a nobody.

472
00:44:33,655 --> 00:44:38,317
Jean-Pierre, just your mother and I,
I want to propose something.

473
00:44:39,887 --> 00:44:42,571
As you know, convey their work...

474
00:44:42,572 --> 00:44:45,715
It is the duty of co-
Returned to France.

475
00:44:47,169 --> 00:44:50,450
And the dream of all parents,
is seeing her son...

476
00:44:50,451 --> 00:44:53,245
Continue your work.

477
00:44:54,882 --> 00:44:57,318
The fisherman, would like
see his son fishing...

478
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:59,843
The farmer, cultivate your child...

479
00:45:00,329 --> 00:45:04,195
When your child blacksmith forge,
and patatero...

480
00:45:07,138 --> 00:45:08,875
Do not worry.

481
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:12,044
You are about to rebound.

482
00:45:12,764 --> 00:45:14,298
Sure you're going to rebound.

483
00:45:15,404 --> 00:45:17,321
Because you're...

484
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:20,207
A winner.

485
00:45:23,296 --> 00:45:24,874
You are at maturity.

486
00:45:30,784 --> 00:45:33,086
What you will achieve, sure.

487
00:45:33,871 --> 00:45:35,575
He has a wife...

488
00:45:36,276 --> 00:45:38,877
He...

489
00:45:39,606 --> 00:45:41,603
He... or rather has a daughter.

490
00:45:41,604 --> 00:45:43,454
He has a house...

491
00:45:44,359 --> 00:45:46,988
It has... several pants...

492
00:45:46,989 --> 00:45:48,854
Many pairs of shoes...

493
00:45:48,855 --> 00:45:51,047
Expect it warm in the house
when he returns from work...

494
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:52,151
And works well...

495
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:55,657
But now, is a little bad, see?

496
00:45:55,958 --> 00:45:57,168
Yes, it's there.

497
00:45:57,169 --> 00:46:00,847
He asked me to represent him,
so I'll give...

498
00:46:01,456 --> 00:46:03,334
His... his shorts...

499
00:46:03,435 --> 00:46:04,824
Yes, I really like this.

500
00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:07,960
Here, I can locate.
It's where my parents.

501
00:46:07,961 --> 00:46:10,954
My dad is CEO
the Patatería, there.

502
00:46:11,755 --> 00:46:12,536
Agree?

503
00:46:12,571 --> 00:46:13,895
Not to speak too fast.

504
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,396
She had a stroke...

505
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:17,050
Smoking a cigarette...

506
00:46:17,879 --> 00:46:20,523
So better contact me.

507
00:46:20,524 --> 00:46:23,376
If you have a job to Jean-Pierre,
my brother...

508
00:46:24,253 --> 00:46:26,630
Would be nice if it were a
permanent contract well paid.

509
00:46:27,915 --> 00:46:30,116
Because... is a brain. Ok?

510
00:46:30,317 --> 00:46:31,382
Thank you!

511
00:46:32,083 --> 00:46:33,322
You can not, sir.

512
00:46:34,235 --> 00:46:35,711
How it is possible?

513
00:46:37,424 --> 00:46:41,180
My brother works up to 7 hours a day,
you see?

514
00:46:41,181 --> 00:46:44,113
Is sacrificed,
and can not know...

515
00:46:44,148 --> 00:46:46,610
The manager of this store of shit!

516
00:46:46,611 --> 00:46:48,463
No Sir, is the crisis.

517
00:46:49,245 --> 00:46:49,985
What?

518
00:46:49,986 --> 00:46:51,668
- Is the crisis.
- The crisis!

519
00:46:54,315 --> 00:46:57,164
Are you making fun of me?
I see people with cars...

520
00:46:57,165 --> 00:46:59,799
Full of shit products,
very expensive, no crisis!

521
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,915
- Do not tell stories, I know...
- Calm down.

522
00:47:01,916 --> 00:47:03,607
Be right back.

523
00:47:03,608 --> 00:47:06,828
That's it! Go...

524
00:47:08,693 --> 00:47:10,357
Ya, right!

525
00:47:10,935 --> 00:47:13,318
No wonder
if after brain drain there!

526
00:47:13,319 --> 00:47:14,685
Because he school has less...

527
00:47:15,777 --> 00:47:18,174
Watch your penguin!
Dale, go get security!

528
00:47:18,931 --> 00:47:20,895
In any case we never
worked for Chinese!

529
00:47:20,896 --> 00:47:22,130
Long live the Dalai Lama!

530
00:47:22,231 --> 00:47:24,927
What the hell are you doing!
You fool! Come here!

531
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:31,689
Enough with your safety, okay!

532
00:47:43,425 --> 00:47:45,894
- Good morning.
- Good morning Mr. Bonzini.

533
00:47:49,252 --> 00:47:51,775
I was asked to tell you...

534
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:54,551
- His two sons...
- Yes?

535
00:47:54,586 --> 00:47:56,050
Not going well.

536
00:47:56,956 --> 00:47:58,321
How not going well?

537
00:47:58,571 --> 00:48:00,787
Well, not going well.

538
00:48:01,721 --> 00:48:04,209
- Not going well?
- No. Not going well.

539
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:08,295
That's not right.

540
00:48:12,025 --> 00:48:14,130
But... It will go well?

541
00:48:14,131 --> 00:48:19,159
No, it will not do well.
We are not going well at all.

542
00:48:20,788 --> 00:48:24,120
Or if you are walking...
But it will be wrong...

543
00:48:24,977 --> 00:48:28,115
- And you are ...?
- Yes, I will...

544
00:48:31,879 --> 00:48:34,083
This is not right at all.

545
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:40,828
- And you walk ...?
- Yes.

546
00:48:41,456 --> 00:48:43,853
- Yes .. If I walk...
- Really goes ...?

547
00:48:46,043 --> 00:48:47,307
Well wrong.

548
00:48:47,606 --> 00:48:50,494
- Yes, I'm...
- Go...

549
00:48:51,502 --> 00:48:54,915
Well...
I will say that it will do well.

550
00:48:54,916 --> 00:48:55,916
Okay.

551
00:50:24,897 --> 00:50:26,794
JUSTICE!

552
00:50:26,995 --> 00:50:28,654
JUSTICE!

553
00:50:41,807 --> 00:50:43,874
JUSTICE!

554
00:50:43,909 --> 00:50:47,701
JUSTICE!

555
00:51:17,619 --> 00:51:21,714
Take this can,
and press hard with your mouth.

556
00:51:23,074 --> 00:51:24,332
Agree?

557
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:26,920
Let me do.

558
00:51:26,921 --> 00:51:28,989
That's it. Squeeze.

559
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:31,009
It may hurt.

560
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:34,423
Ready?

561
00:51:47,726 --> 00:51:49,210
You were a cuckoo...

562
00:51:50,849 --> 00:51:54,106
And you're going to become an eagle,
my brother.

563
00:51:56,109 --> 00:51:57,647
You were a dung beetle...

564
00:51:59,695 --> 00:52:01,496
And you're going to become earwig.

565
00:52:03,353 --> 00:52:05,615
You were just a appetizer...

566
00:52:07,915 --> 00:52:10,100
And you will become a main course.

567
00:52:14,127 --> 00:52:15,762
Yes, I know.

568
00:52:16,752 --> 00:52:19,922
You thought your life was over?
But new is about to begin, brother.

569
00:52:23,738 --> 00:52:27,049
I'll put the ink.
Bleeds a little, but it's nothing.

570
00:52:27,698 --> 00:52:29,287
It is normal.

571
00:52:34,682 --> 00:52:36,727
Through this sacred act...

572
00:52:39,324 --> 00:52:40,920
I release you...

573
00:52:41,222 --> 00:52:42,748
Yoke...

574
00:52:42,749 --> 00:52:45,558
Job... Forever.

575
00:52:49,759 --> 00:52:52,877
We tightened, strong squeezes.

576
00:52:53,843 --> 00:52:55,687
You are free! You are free!

577
00:54:20,402 --> 00:54:25,337
Hey! I had a dream.
Danced really well in my dream.

578
00:54:25,538 --> 00:54:27,756
Congratulations!

579
00:54:37,673 --> 00:54:40,308
Hey, Diogenes!
Get up, we have to do!

580
00:54:47,219 --> 00:54:50,712
<i>Was born last night...</i>

581
00:54:53,763 --> 00:54:57,489
<i>Between heaven and earth...</i>

582
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,539
<i>never knew my mother...</i>

583
00:55:05,102 --> 00:55:07,394
<i>never knew my father...</i>

584
00:55:08,917 --> 00:55:11,965
<i>'m a butterfly...</i>

585
00:55:13,164 --> 00:55:16,066
<i>not know my name...</i>

586
00:55:21,388 --> 00:55:24,450
<i>'m a butterfly...</i>

587
00:55:39,089 --> 00:55:41,076
What did you do to my hair?

588
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:45,779
It's nothing. Just a scab.

589
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:48,720
- No need to touch but will stay.
- A scab of what?

590
00:55:48,721 --> 00:55:50,453
It's nothing,
is because you moved.

591
00:55:52,686 --> 00:55:54,086
And I left behind, no?

592
00:55:54,087 --> 00:55:55,766
No, well behind.

593
00:55:56,554 --> 00:55:58,975
- You cut back too?
- Should get you this thing.

594
00:55:58,976 --> 00:56:00,543
- The tie?
- Yes?

595
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:04,780
Yes, because if you're a wild dog,
not you stay with your belt.

596
00:56:10,424 --> 00:56:11,769
I can give some advice?

597
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:13,470
Yes, go ahead.

598
00:56:14,485 --> 00:56:16,594
You should take care.

599
00:56:17,466 --> 00:56:19,835
Because when you live on the street...

600
00:56:19,836 --> 00:56:23,077
And not only, but especially
if you live in the street...

601
00:56:23,078 --> 00:56:25,773
You have to watch,
have to take the time.

602
00:56:27,443 --> 00:56:28,410
- I understand?
- Yes.

603
00:56:30,827 --> 00:56:32,755
For example...

604
00:56:33,609 --> 00:56:35,548
Walk a little to see.

605
00:56:35,749 --> 00:56:37,371
- Walk?
- Yes.

606
00:56:37,372 --> 00:56:40,772
Where do you want to walk?
So later?

607
00:56:40,973 --> 00:56:43,048
Camino.

608
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:47,313
Is this okay?

609
00:56:48,715 --> 00:56:49,861
No, not right.

610
00:56:49,862 --> 00:56:52,005
- What is wrong?
- No, not right.

611
00:56:54,102 --> 00:56:55,900
You are very tense.

612
00:56:56,643 --> 00:57:00,386
Feel your neck? It's like cement.
Surely your heart beats.

613
00:57:00,387 --> 00:57:02,997
- Sure!
- Look at me.

614
00:57:02,998 --> 00:57:06,085
I'm relaxed. Is the sun...

615
00:57:07,634 --> 00:57:10,758
I totally loose. And way.

616
00:57:11,059 --> 00:57:13,297
My feet stick to the floor, you see?

617
00:57:13,298 --> 00:57:15,172
My arms are rubber...

618
00:57:16,572 --> 00:57:19,951
My brain is just available. Logical
because I do not know where I'm going.

619
00:57:19,952 --> 00:57:22,760
I am free, you know? I am free.

620
00:57:23,862 --> 00:57:24,962
Give you!

621
00:57:25,197 --> 00:57:28,182
- Path Like you?
- Dale!

622
00:57:28,183 --> 00:57:31,314
You'll see, is very...

623
00:57:36,344 --> 00:57:38,520
- So?
- Yeah, all right, and especially...

624
00:57:39,712 --> 00:57:43,067
You should not stay still.
Never, but you think about it.

625
00:57:43,068 --> 00:57:44,837
And if you think, you die.

626
00:57:44,838 --> 00:57:47,557
In addition, walking is healthy.

627
00:57:47,658 --> 00:57:49,741
Ever see a fat punk?

628
00:57:50,142 --> 00:57:51,563
No!

629
00:57:54,468 --> 00:57:56,603
- You are progressing.
- So?

630
00:57:56,604 --> 00:57:59,199
Dams, for here there everywhere.
Just tame.

631
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,518
No need to scare them.
View our faces?

632
00:58:02,738 --> 00:58:05,042
You have to sweeten your voice...

633
00:58:05,043 --> 00:58:06,941
Reach out and seem miserable.

634
00:58:07,805 --> 00:58:10,253
Lady, have a penny, to eat?

635
00:58:12,189 --> 00:58:13,879
Dale!

636
00:58:20,238 --> 00:58:23,395
Sorry Ms.
It would have a dime...

637
00:58:23,396 --> 00:58:25,778
No, no!

638
00:58:28,141 --> 00:58:29,380
What did I do?

639
00:58:30,858 --> 00:58:34,040
I did it just the way you said:
I relaxed...

640
00:58:39,441 --> 00:58:40,559
Sorry Ms...

641
00:58:41,235 --> 00:58:43,276
Leave it. Leave it!

642
00:58:43,943 --> 00:58:45,682
Not a hunchback!

643
00:58:45,683 --> 00:58:47,842
No wonder you never
you sold mattresses!

644
00:58:48,898 --> 00:58:51,288
You look like a hunchback!

645
00:58:51,289 --> 00:58:54,616
You have to look miserable,
but not a total idiot!

646
00:58:56,985 --> 00:58:59,369
No, that's enough!
I'll get the dog back.

647
00:59:01,713 --> 00:59:04,212
It's okay. It is the beginning.

648
00:59:05,063 --> 00:59:08,840
It's okay!
Let's find the dog, it will be easier.

649
00:59:08,841 --> 00:59:11,923
- Because the dog knows what to do?
- No, but pitiful dogs, come!

650
00:59:21,631 --> 00:59:22,773
Good morning.

651
00:59:31,197 --> 00:59:33,997
Forgiveness.
It would have a cigarette?

652
00:59:38,628 --> 00:59:39,862
A cigarette?

653
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:47,824
A cigarette. Smoking.

654
01:00:02,355 --> 01:00:05,586
Not take two more.
It's for my brother and me.

655
01:00:10,743 --> 01:00:12,377
I can stay with the pack?

656
01:00:38,899 --> 01:00:42,222
<i>Bravo! Dress, I tell you!</i>

657
01:00:45,594 --> 01:00:47,427
I'll introduce a cool guy.

658
01:00:47,428 --> 01:00:50,559
Reads the future in the brandy.
Never was wrong with me.

659
01:00:50,594 --> 01:00:51,896
- Is he here?
- Are here.

660
01:00:53,329 --> 01:00:55,269
He is very nervous.

661
01:01:03,213 --> 01:01:05,509
- I can?
- Wait!

662
01:01:07,174 --> 01:01:08,810
I can ask you something?

663
01:01:09,993 --> 01:01:14,079
Yes I will...

664
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:17,418
I will find work again?

665
01:01:23,519 --> 01:01:24,435
No!

666
01:01:26,289 --> 01:01:29,359
You will not find work
immediately...

667
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:35,122
But... will achieve getting...
a practice...

668
01:01:35,123 --> 01:01:38,838
Without renumbering,
in home care.

669
01:01:40,896 --> 01:01:42,574
All right.

670
01:01:45,964 --> 01:01:48,309
- Y...
- Wait.

671
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:51,597
Dale, ask your question.

672
01:01:51,932 --> 01:01:53,723
Will I live long?

673
01:02:01,258 --> 01:02:02,348
No!

674
01:02:03,603 --> 01:02:06,046
Less than Sor Teresa...

675
01:02:06,850 --> 01:02:09,648
But more than Benny Hill...

676
01:02:09,649 --> 01:02:12,350
And soon you'll get...

677
01:02:12,751 --> 01:02:16,119
A safe for adults...

678
01:02:17,370 --> 01:02:18,710
Disabled.

679
01:02:19,342 --> 01:02:20,609
Disabled.

680
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:23,101
Super, then. Super.

681
01:02:26,504 --> 01:02:28,228
Thank you!

682
01:02:30,994 --> 01:02:33,113
Will I meet a woman?

683
01:02:40,184 --> 01:02:41,642
I see...

684
01:02:43,082 --> 01:02:44,791
A beautiful woman...

685
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:47,203
Very cute.

686
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:52,953
- Yes?
- With Asian features...

687
01:02:53,829 --> 01:02:55,815
- Oh yeah?
- Yes.

688
01:02:56,633 --> 01:02:57,868
Look.

689
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:01,625
Deep.

690
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:13,933
Do not worry, I did not tell the truth.
The truth is too beautiful...

691
01:03:13,934 --> 01:03:16,761
For that you can stand.

692
01:03:30,336 --> 01:03:32,890
Have you heard from the boys?

693
01:03:32,991 --> 01:03:34,674
No, no.

694
01:03:51,735 --> 01:03:55,135
Jo! Off the current, fast!

695
01:03:59,276 --> 01:04:01,092
What are you doing?

696
01:04:02,048 --> 01:04:04,684
Dad, Mom, we are here!

697
01:04:07,626 --> 01:04:11,988
You're our father?
What do you mean?

698
01:04:16,196 --> 01:04:18,196
Well, I am your father.

699
01:04:24,585 --> 01:04:26,878
Mom...

700
01:04:29,869 --> 01:04:31,295
Is it true?

701
01:04:48,208 --> 01:04:50,772
Why?

702
01:04:51,373 --> 01:04:53,385
40 years were delayed to say...

703
01:04:56,772 --> 01:05:00,491
We wanted to tell
when they would be 18 years...

704
01:05:00,492 --> 01:05:03,859
But people never really...

705
01:05:03,894 --> 01:05:05,691
So we did not have the courage.

706
01:05:05,892 --> 01:05:08,024
And...

707
01:05:09,595 --> 01:05:12,248
Retaking Patatería business...

708
01:05:12,349 --> 01:05:16,192
We totally immersed.

709
01:05:17,030 --> 01:05:18,413
That's right!

710
01:05:30,213 --> 01:05:34,525
Both of his parents, because...
I do not know who they are...

711
01:05:34,526 --> 01:05:37,040
Because both times I was drunk...

712
01:05:37,341 --> 01:05:39,308
So... I do not know...

713
01:05:39,909 --> 01:05:41,862
Yeah, okay.

714
01:06:40,277 --> 01:06:42,477
Where can we go?

715
01:06:42,778 --> 01:06:46,686
We had no future,
Now we are not even past.

716
01:06:46,687 --> 01:06:47,939
Bravo!

717
01:06:48,174 --> 01:06:51,664
I told you:
It is best not to think.

718
01:06:51,865 --> 01:06:55,670
Go ahead, live the present.

719
01:07:00,286 --> 01:07:01,565
Silly!

720
01:07:02,615 --> 01:07:04,036
Silly!

721
01:07:06,237 --> 01:07:07,644
Silly!

722
01:07:08,953 --> 01:07:10,841
Silly!

723
01:07:28,482 --> 01:07:30,061
No one.

724
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:32,579
The shutters are closed.

725
01:07:34,983 --> 01:07:36,421
It means nothing.

726
01:08:00,875 --> 01:08:01,875
Good morning.

727
01:08:03,337 --> 01:08:05,121
Let's go, let's go!

728
01:08:08,645 --> 01:08:11,063
We walked to the stacker and...

729
01:08:11,098 --> 01:08:12,631
We had a gas corduroy.

730
01:08:13,521 --> 01:08:16,531
There are gas around here?

731
01:08:18,969 --> 01:08:19,569
No.

732
01:08:24,854 --> 01:08:26,890
You know, there...

733
01:08:26,891 --> 01:08:29,835
There are times when one,
not much mind...

734
01:08:29,836 --> 01:08:32,465
Looks like everything is going wrong...

735
01:08:32,466 --> 01:08:35,597
But, it's just...
an impression... actually.

736
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:39,207
Recently,
I was not right at all...

737
01:08:39,208 --> 01:08:42,263
And now... See?
I'm much better...

738
01:08:42,264 --> 01:08:44,376
Enjoying...

739
01:08:44,377 --> 01:08:46,801
It's something you think...

740
01:08:47,435 --> 01:08:50,329
How to say...
It's a radical solution...

741
01:08:50,641 --> 01:08:52,779
It is a much simpler solution...

742
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:55,032
A problem,
is surely more complex...

743
01:08:55,067 --> 01:08:59,028
I know your problem...
But surely it is more complex and...

744
01:08:59,064 --> 01:09:02,319
You pretend to be too simple,
against something that is complicated.

745
01:09:14,429 --> 01:09:17,078
Admitting that his idea...

746
01:09:20,103 --> 01:09:22,261
We are not criticizing the concept...

747
01:09:23,451 --> 01:09:26,031
But if I may make a criticism, because...

748
01:09:27,932 --> 01:09:30,174
Lack of originality...

749
01:09:31,475 --> 01:09:33,218
Of happiness...
Of chivalry said...

750
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:36,001
And no punk...

751
01:09:58,814 --> 01:10:00,854
Could have been a psychologist.

752
01:10:01,931 --> 01:10:03,500
See this?

753
01:10:04,001 --> 01:10:07,337
This is from that I share with you.

754
01:10:07,738 --> 01:10:10,469
Sure! Since I share with you.

755
01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:11,985
I feel more people.

756
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:14,731
See, you're right. Before...

757
01:10:14,732 --> 01:10:17,532
People were only leads...

758
01:10:17,533 --> 01:10:18,939
To sell mattresses...

759
01:10:19,187 --> 01:10:22,442
But since I'm with you,
I feel more...

760
01:10:23,253 --> 01:10:25,280
I felt that the guy was bad...

761
01:10:25,281 --> 01:10:26,706
And with some keywords...

762
01:10:26,707 --> 01:10:28,341
And it was thanks to you also.

763
01:10:29,517 --> 01:10:31,004
You said "not punk".

764
01:10:32,306 --> 01:10:35,389
I would not have done better.

765
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:37,913
I swear, you become...

766
01:10:37,914 --> 01:10:41,026
In a doctor of souls...
As the Indians...

767
01:10:41,227 --> 01:10:42,227
It's crazy...

768
01:10:45,534 --> 01:10:46,700
Dress, I'm not that dumb.

769
01:13:57,087 --> 01:13:58,001
Free!

770
01:14:16,253 --> 01:14:18,049
In these times...

771
01:14:18,050 --> 01:14:21,205
There is no life for children.

772
01:14:22,106 --> 01:14:25,216
Two children.
Two poor children...

773
01:14:25,317 --> 01:14:27,468
Lost.

774
01:14:27,739 --> 01:14:29,171
They are tiresome!

775
01:14:29,272 --> 01:14:33,891
They are tiresome,
but even more burdensome when not.

776
01:14:37,653 --> 01:14:39,160
On the other hand...

777
01:14:41,463 --> 01:14:44,014
We achieved what we wanted.

778
01:14:44,015 --> 01:14:46,807
They are free.

779
01:14:46,908 --> 01:14:49,591
With Jean-Pierre, was hard.

780
01:14:50,723 --> 01:14:53,231
But we did not?

781
01:14:59,465 --> 01:15:02,685
And we... What we're bored!

782
01:15:10,788 --> 01:15:12,419
Where are the people?

783
01:15:15,439 --> 01:15:16,888
I do not know.

784
01:15:17,519 --> 01:15:19,312
They're not in the factories...

785
01:15:20,174 --> 01:15:21,928
No longer on the field...

786
01:15:22,229 --> 01:15:23,842
They're not in the churches...

787
01:15:23,843 --> 01:15:25,166
Where are they?

788
01:15:25,367 --> 01:15:28,914
They are at home.
They are alone in their homes.

789
01:15:53,828 --> 01:15:56,338
- Where are we going?
- Come on.

790
01:15:56,339 --> 01:16:00,006
You know, the shortest path to freedom,
is a straight line.

791
01:16:00,007 --> 01:16:02,853
- You mean: right?
- Yes, progress.

792
01:16:02,854 --> 01:16:04,649
- Right, right?
- Yes!

793
01:16:04,650 --> 01:16:06,502
- Ok.
- What are you doing?

794
01:16:06,503 --> 01:16:08,480
- Well, I'm right.
- Stop!

795
01:16:09,081 --> 01:16:11,662
Right is right!

796
01:16:13,264 --> 01:16:15,761
Right, you're right, straight!

797
01:16:20,350 --> 01:16:21,858
What right idea to put a swimming pool!

798
01:16:25,868 --> 01:16:27,855
All that is yours is ours,
buddy!

799
01:16:35,047 --> 01:16:38,229
Sorry, sorry.
Only we, go straight.

800
01:16:38,430 --> 01:16:41,895
- This is private property!
- No! Your house belongs to the bank!

801
01:16:45,238 --> 01:16:47,902
- I'm calling the police!
- Yes, call the police!

802
01:16:47,903 --> 01:16:49,890
They are just like you,
have nothing to do.

803
01:16:50,091 --> 01:16:51,791
Criminals!

804
01:16:57,266 --> 01:16:58,831
It's us. We are up straight!

805
01:17:00,228 --> 01:17:01,969
We straight. Hello Mrs!

806
01:17:02,670 --> 01:17:04,132
Hey! They're in my house!

807
01:17:04,241 --> 01:17:06,323
- We're not at home!
- This is my house!

808
01:17:06,435 --> 01:17:10,033
I'll tell you something:
Your house is in a flood zone.

809
01:17:10,068 --> 01:17:11,439
Exactly! I fished here!

810
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:14,898
I caught fish of 10 pounds!

811
01:17:17,336 --> 01:17:19,700
If you listen well here. Come!

812
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:22,671
- You hear the river!
- Let's go!

813
01:17:26,553 --> 01:17:27,853
And she listens to the river!

814
01:17:28,054 --> 01:17:29,453
With this wonderful day...

815
01:17:29,488 --> 01:17:32,284
That is both the union
among youth...

816
01:17:32,319 --> 01:17:33,552
And experience...

817
01:17:33,587 --> 01:17:37,069
Between my daughter
and my old Latin teacher...

818
01:17:37,104 --> 01:17:39,421
Among Bénédicte and Quentin...

819
01:17:39,456 --> 01:17:42,884
Among the distilleries Bougnac and
Gerbaux the liquor stores...

820
01:17:42,885 --> 01:17:46,285
I'm the man...
Dad the happiest.

821
01:17:46,586 --> 01:17:49,581
I appreciate all be present...

822
01:17:50,515 --> 01:17:53,599
It's the start of a day
promises to be formidable.

823
01:17:54,346 --> 01:17:56,433
And they will not hesitate...

824
01:17:56,908 --> 01:17:58,605
All memories.

825
01:17:59,128 --> 01:18:00,297
Bravo!

826
01:18:15,095 --> 01:18:17,150
Caballero, please.

827
01:18:28,117 --> 01:18:30,984
<i>Beer! Beer!</i>

828
01:18:30,985 --> 01:18:33,623
<i>But what made me, Beer?</i>

829
01:18:34,289 --> 01:18:36,746
<i>Beer! Beer!</i>

830
01:18:36,747 --> 01:18:39,640
<i>Like my brother!</i>

831
01:19:36,171 --> 01:19:38,451
Sylvie, wanted to say...

832
01:19:38,652 --> 01:19:41,406
You were right...

833
01:19:41,407 --> 01:19:42,889
I'm an idiot.

834
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:45,505
But I've changed.

835
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,922
I'm more calm.
More mature, more responsible...

836
01:19:51,123 --> 01:19:54,525
All this got me thinking.

837
01:19:56,877 --> 01:20:01,686
I can not say anything,
is a little secret yet, but...

838
01:20:01,687 --> 01:20:03,441
I'm going to surprise you.

839
01:20:05,659 --> 01:20:09,262
I'll do anything.
And you'll be proud of me.

840
01:20:09,263 --> 01:20:12,524
What I will do for you,
by Audrey, for your future.

841
01:20:12,525 --> 01:20:16,955
To have a cleaner world,
he left it to get...

842
01:20:18,006 --> 01:20:19,115
That's it.

843
01:20:21,488 --> 01:20:23,469
Do not forget...

844
01:20:24,749 --> 01:20:26,655
From watching TV tonight.

845
01:20:27,732 --> 01:20:29,854
You'll be proud.

846
01:20:31,869 --> 01:20:35,506
You'll see what your father will do for you.
Your dad loves you.

847
01:20:40,035 --> 01:20:43,400
Words are nothing.
Come! To act!

848
01:20:48,069 --> 01:20:49,859
Why back here?

849
01:20:50,609 --> 01:20:52,222
If you think about it...

850
01:20:52,323 --> 01:20:55,041
It is in a place like this
we can light the fuse.

851
01:20:55,136 --> 01:20:56,826
As in Tunisia or Egypt.

852
01:20:57,692 --> 01:21:00,094
Let's not be silly a salesman!

853
01:21:00,813 --> 01:21:04,997
I remember you started to burn
and nobody cared.

854
01:21:06,077 --> 01:21:08,389
Yes, but that's because
need convincing...

855
01:21:08,489 --> 01:21:10,501
- Take them to think...
- And how?

856
01:21:11,210 --> 01:21:12,781
Wake.

857
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:18,989
With all your groups,
know many people?

858
01:21:18,990 --> 01:21:21,617
- Are you on Facebook?
- Yes.

859
01:21:21,652 --> 01:21:26,424
Well, you could use the network,
and convince people.

860
01:21:26,425 --> 01:21:28,878
How about it, eh?

861
01:21:28,979 --> 01:21:32,573
That would be great fondness.

862
01:21:32,774 --> 01:21:35,458
- What would you do for me?
- Yes.

863
01:21:36,365 --> 01:21:39,766
Then we are at 20h,
opposite the old Sodimac.

864
01:21:43,133 --> 01:21:47,110
- I call it?
- Goodbye, Mrs. Groupiant.

865
01:21:56,914 --> 01:21:58,430
You find it?

866
01:21:59,715 --> 01:22:01,643
"Life before it." Is this it?

867
01:22:01,844 --> 01:22:04,606
Yes, I changed the cap,
look inside.

868
01:22:04,807 --> 01:22:06,818
"Insurrection is coming."

869
01:22:07,828 --> 01:22:10,279
Hey, wait. Discreet.

870
01:22:11,081 --> 01:22:14,417
Now you have everything you need
to do what you want to do.

871
01:22:15,255 --> 01:22:17,305
Always took risks you, eh?

872
01:22:17,306 --> 01:22:19,500
You were the only union
at Grand Litter.

873
01:22:19,501 --> 01:22:22,236
So you do not actually stand.
As everyone.

874
01:22:22,537 --> 01:22:23,892
But it has changed.

875
01:22:24,589 --> 01:22:27,512
- Can we count on you?
- Do they do?

876
01:22:27,513 --> 01:22:30,717
Well, making a mess
at the mall!

877
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:33,013
Light the wick.

878
01:22:33,113 --> 01:22:35,411
Be the detonators
a great social explosion!

879
01:22:36,212 --> 01:22:39,011
- When you want to do?
- Tonight!

880
01:22:39,912 --> 01:22:44,150
Tonight...
I get people to dinner...

881
01:22:45,097 --> 01:22:49,081
And I think... It's never good
to get carried away by anger.

882
01:22:49,116 --> 01:22:50,401
Anger is a bad counselor.

883
01:22:51,522 --> 01:22:53,676
You have to wait it out.

884
01:22:55,235 --> 01:22:56,560
Coming or not?

885
01:22:58,140 --> 01:22:59,701
'Il Do my best.

886
01:22:59,702 --> 01:23:02,950
Go! Make an effort!
It is only 10 meters...

887
01:23:02,951 --> 01:23:03,938
Former Sodimac.

888
01:23:04,039 --> 01:23:06,619
- Come on!
- 'Ll Do my best.

889
01:23:09,838 --> 01:23:10,993
See you tonight!

890
01:23:24,438 --> 01:23:25,247
Knight!

891
01:23:26,233 --> 01:23:27,970
At 20h!

892
01:23:28,734 --> 01:23:31,606
At 20h, tonight...
There will be something...

893
01:23:33,351 --> 01:23:35,487
Today at 20h,
there will be something.

894
01:23:36,388 --> 01:23:37,980
Near Sodimac.

895
01:23:39,362 --> 01:23:41,089
In Sodimac tonight.

896
01:23:47,507 --> 01:23:49,539
It would have a yogurt?

897
01:23:50,702 --> 01:23:52,821
And today is at 20h,
in Sodimac.

898
01:23:52,922 --> 01:23:57,079
In the former parking lot.
And you have to tell more people, right?

899
01:23:58,074 --> 01:23:59,429
Advise, right?

900
01:24:27,001 --> 01:24:30,985
- Will come tonight?
- No, we have a drink, do not have time.

901
01:24:30,986 --> 01:24:33,096
We have to go see my mom.
No time.

902
01:24:33,097 --> 01:24:34,097
- Sorry.
- You have the key?

903
01:24:37,410 --> 01:24:40,253
- The things can change.
- Yes, I know.

904
01:24:46,829 --> 01:24:49,281
- It's tonight at 20h.
- Okay, okay.

905
01:24:49,382 --> 01:24:52,165
- In ancient Sodimac.
- Okay, thanks.

906
01:25:12,268 --> 01:25:13,633
Lady!

907
01:25:18,356 --> 01:25:21,262
I'm going to get stubborn.
It's too much for me!

908
01:25:23,913 --> 01:25:26,720
- And ...?
- Is progressing.

909
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:29,510
- We're good!
- Eh?

910
01:25:30,478 --> 01:25:33,472
- They are excited!
- Yes, super excited!

911
01:25:33,673 --> 01:25:36,016
Will explode!

912
01:25:55,927 --> 01:26:00,014
I stand: Not my name.

913
01:26:01,129 --> 01:26:04,673
I am the oldest punk with dog
Europe.

914
01:26:06,492 --> 01:26:09,974
And believe me...
It's not easy.

915
01:26:10,643 --> 01:26:12,023
I'm free...

916
01:26:12,670 --> 01:26:13,960
But it costs...

917
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:19,449
It's not easy...
It is not easy not to fall to the liter...

918
01:26:19,450 --> 01:26:22,646
It is not easy to beg
poor people...

919
01:26:23,495 --> 01:26:26,580
It's not easy being rejected
by women...

920
01:26:27,633 --> 01:26:29,471
It is not easy
actually be only...

921
01:26:30,541 --> 01:26:31,791
So...

922
01:26:32,957 --> 01:26:34,970
They will all agree
me to say that ..

923
01:26:34,971 --> 01:26:37,925
Now... ENOUGH!

924
01:26:38,516 --> 01:26:41,382
Enough! It has to stop,
because they are just like me...

925
01:26:41,383 --> 01:26:44,376
Underpaid, desconsideraros...

926
01:26:44,898 --> 01:26:47,300
And there is no one above
who cares about you.

927
01:26:47,717 --> 01:26:50,053
It is time that the pack yell!

928
01:26:50,054 --> 01:26:53,107
Because we are all punks with dogs.
All!

929
01:26:54,069 --> 01:26:57,210
So if like me
want to do something big...

930
01:26:57,211 --> 01:27:00,936
To join in the old parking
Sodimac...

931
01:27:00,937 --> 01:27:03,710
At 20h. Long live the...

933
01:27:15,539 --> 01:27:16,685
The 21hrs.

934
01:27:24,994 --> 01:27:28,532
Maybe too late to...

935
01:27:29,133 --> 01:27:32,024
Perhaps we had
have done it earlier.

936
01:27:32,125 --> 01:27:33,181
Yes.

937
01:27:34,455 --> 01:27:36,102
People working late...

938
01:27:36,303 --> 01:27:39,641
Having nanny is expensive...
Well, this is very...

939
01:27:39,742 --> 01:27:41,063
It stands to reason.

940
01:27:48,697 --> 01:27:51,125
We had not have done a weekday.

941
01:27:52,774 --> 01:27:55,705
Yes, but still...
I thought we would be more than two!

942
01:28:04,813 --> 01:28:06,024
Good afternoon sir.

943
01:28:06,786 --> 01:28:08,294
I was an idiot!

944
01:28:10,301 --> 01:28:13,167
I just wanted them away
Restaurant.

945
01:28:14,458 --> 01:28:17,283
- For Dad!
- This work made me an idiot.

946
01:28:19,330 --> 01:28:20,691
Hey, Dad?

947
01:28:22,693 --> 01:28:25,447
We did not think for a second
in your story.

948
01:28:28,955 --> 01:28:30,563
My kids good...

949
01:28:32,243 --> 01:28:33,367
My little children...

950
01:28:38,197 --> 01:28:39,296
Dad?

951
01:28:40,644 --> 01:28:43,120
Had to have warned us,
that life was so hard, you know?

952
01:28:43,459 --> 01:28:44,814
Yes, I know.

953
01:28:47,897 --> 01:28:50,967
- You know what to do?
- Go ahead.

954
01:28:51,701 --> 01:28:52,900
Follow.

955
01:28:53,812 --> 01:28:55,452
Follow what?

956
01:28:58,524 --> 01:29:00,569
I have a little idea for you.

957
01:29:48,196 --> 01:29:50,049
Not bad!

958
01:31:49,069 --> 01:31:54,723
The Big Night.
