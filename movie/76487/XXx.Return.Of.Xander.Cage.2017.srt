3
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,730
You know how I came up with the idea of Triple-X program?

4
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,330
Skateboards and swimming pools.

5
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,090
Augustus Gibbons Founder of the XXX Program

6
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,820
Single-handedly Stopped World War 3

7
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,770
Skateboards used to be stuck on the ground, unless in transportation.

8
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,480
In 1977 habits.

9
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,050
A big drought hit southern California.

10
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:03,280
Got so bad that rich urbanites could not afford to fill their swimming pools.

11
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,060
That's when the light clicked on. Some kid figured it out ...

12
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,330
He could escape these empty pools and get some real nasty air

13
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:15,340
Dogtown and Z-Boys. Have you seen it? It is a movie.

14
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,310
Does not matter.

15
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:20,610
Anyhow, our hero starts doing things on a board ...

16
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,130
and no one had ever seen.

17
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,860
Things the world thought were impossible.

18
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,700
Now that kid needed it, that draught.

19
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,220
The world needed those empty pools.

20
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,950
That's why Triple-X.

21
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,340
NEYMAR JR. XXX Active RECRUIT OF A GENIUS WITH BALL at his feet

22
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,330
Scored 100 goals by age 20

23
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,470
THOUGHT he was being recruting for THE AVENGERS

24
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:49,640
Do you feel safer today than you felt yesterday? I know I do not.

25
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,020
The biggest, most expensive military in the world ...

26
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,480
and we are still scared the shoes and tiny whitey bombs at the airport.

27
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,880
Why is that?

28
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,600
Beacuse the soldiers are built to take orders and fight in wars.

29
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,570
But we, my friend, are not at war.

30
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,400
We are at peril.

31
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,020
That's why Triple-X.

32
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,670
What's matter? You are on a diet? You're not hungry?

33
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:16,850
It's 7:30 in the morning.

34
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,340
So? It's lunch or dinner time somewhere in the world. Come up! Eat up!

35
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,710
You know who does feel safe? The man in charge. The world beaters.

36
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:28,890
The top chief par excellence ayatollahs with all the dollars.

37
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,720
And that's because those righteous bastard somewhere along the way ...

38
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,080
made a deal with the devil. They traded liberty for safety. And us ...

39
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,700
we the people

40
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,260
ended up losing both. That's why Triple-X.

41
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,590
While anybody else is stuck on the ground ...

42
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:48,280
we're doing shit on the board nobody's even seen before

43
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,400
Well, that's my pitch

44
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,520
I've always worked as spy better than a salesman

45
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,840
So, what do you say?

46
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,710
I'm not a hero. I'm just a footballer.

47
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,410
My bad.

48
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,560
So I leave you be there.

49
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:12,170
Who says that there is no such thing as free, meal

50
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,570
Down on the ground! Now! Give me the money!

51
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,370
Do not move!

52
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,880
Hurry up!

53
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,160
Goal!

54
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,550
And you say you're no hero.

55
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,890
I gotta call bullshit on that!

56
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,580
You're exactly the kind of hero the world needs.

57
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,120
At the end of the day, it comes down to the same question ...

58
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,910
I've been asking my wife every Friday night for the last 20 years.

59
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,270
Do you want some of this?

60
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,120
Or you just gonna...?

61
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,430
Return of the Xander Cage

62
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:15,380
CIA HEADQUARTERS NEW YORK CITY

63
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,840
access granted

64
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,440
Okay you may sit.

65
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,180
Gentlemen...

66
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:02,640
This is the device that crashed the satellite and killed Gibbons.

67
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,090
Nerds in the lab had coined it "Pandora's Box".

68
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:19,280
My team backtracked satellite's last signal input to Miami.

69
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,140
Some assholes leading the high life at the Ritz-Carlton pentahouse...

70
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,760
thought he could hold the world ransom.

71
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,680
Three flashbangs, two bullets and one body back later ...

72
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,450
we took custody of the device.

73
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,620
We must have over hundreds redundancies in place...

74
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,920
to prevent some punk with a laptop from hijacking satellites.

75
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,250
And Pandora's Box can bypass them all of them.

76
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,340
With of a push a button, it can eavesdrop on secured communications ...

77
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,840
corrupt military software, transmit false intelligence or ...

78
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,860
crash a satellite out of the sky like a goddamn tactical warhead.

79
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,680
One of you is behind this.

80
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,680
I am not leaving until I find out who.

81
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,790
You fight me with a book?

82
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,630
Here you go, brother! Chapter 1!

83
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:33,930
Page One!

84
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,100
Sheer habits.

85
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,390
You were late!

86
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,110
Just in time, boss.

87
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,500
They busted in here, step on our throats ...

88
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,510
and take the one device that can cause a global power shift.

89
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,950
So how do we get it back

90
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,850
These assholes just took our best of the best like they were in a Sunday brunch.

91
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,390
We need someone who move like them, fight like them.

92
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:46,700
We need someone who can walk into a tornado ...

93
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,080
and come out the other side like it was a damn gentle breeze.

94
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,620
Do you know someone like that?

95
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:56,890
No.

96
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,850
But Gibbons did.

97
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,570
DEFCON 1

98
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,600
Get down from there! What are you doing?

99
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,400
Xander!

100
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,400
Gracias, senor.

101
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,940
And here we go! We are on the way!

102
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,200
I knew you would do it, Xander. You brought the world to us.

103
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,180
The world is big, but always fits in your heart.

104
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,280
Take it with you always

105
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,750
Now, go, go.

106
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,570
Of course Xander Cage could pay the satellite company ...

107
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,520
just like a regular guy

108
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,130
What?

109
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,930
And line the pockets of some boardroom billionaires?

110
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,580
You know

111
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,370
These days, a regular guy can't afford to be a regular.

112
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,430
- Up. - Let's go.

113
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,600
Rule 1 Don't fall.

114
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:18,910
Santo Domingo. Dominican Republic.

115
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,060
Is the world getting smaller?

116
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,860
I know the feeling.

117
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,300
Running from your problems never works out.

118
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,100
You need a new plan.

119
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:49,660
I need a new map.

120
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,330
Do not say I did not warn you.

121
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,790
Oh boy.

122
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,670
Here we go again.

123
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,280
Get down. Do not move asshole

124
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,290
On your knees now, you son of bitch!

125
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:56,690
I want to comply, I really want to comply but you're confusing me.

126
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,430
"Do not move, asshole". "On your knees you son of bitch" Which is it?

127
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,610
- You have three seconds to comply! - You're not good at this.

128
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,710
One!

129
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,110
Two

130
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,080
Okay!

131
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,840
Come out, Frankesnstein!

132
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,860
Gibbons! Gibbons?

133
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:32,350
Olly, olly, oxen free.

134
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:38,700
You really do look different, Gibbons.

135
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,580
Did you lose weight?

136
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,900
Augustus always had such...well

137
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,670
not excatly nice things to say about you.

138
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,680
When did you realize it was all fake?

139
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,310
You mean the clown show?

140
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,110
You had a guy over there wearing thousand dollars beats...

141
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,470
where you can buy a knock-off for half the price.

142
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:01,240
Or the lady that was running to catch a bus that doesn't leave for two hours.

143
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:04,910
Or the security guard over there buying a soda with foreign currency?

144
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,090
You know what the kicker was?

145
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,100
Clearence from "It's a Wonderful Life".

146
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,820
You know the nice old man who sat down next to me with the bag of bombs?

147
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,790
Just happen he knows I spoke English.

148
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,560
Go figure.

149
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:21,270
- Bullets could have been real. - And the body armour would have been real.

150
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:25,860
I do not know you, but I don't like to be tested.

151
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:30,180
Gibbons never believed you were dead. He never stopped looking for you.

152
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,180
- Hell of a friend. - Yeah. Well, the joke's on him.

153
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,250
- Because we were never friends. - Trust me, he is not laughing.

154
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:41,260
Nor will he ever again for that matter.

155
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,490
I had never seen anything like it.

156
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:52,370
This group is lethal, and they do not care who or what gets it their way.

157
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:55,650
I was hoping you will be interested in headlining the next five card.

158
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,810
30 feet across, 90 feet down.

159
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,150
3 inches security glass?

160
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:05,300
No ropes, no line, no parachute.

161
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,480
I bet they had a blast.

162
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,360
We ran facial identification on every database in the world. Nothing.

163
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,920
Not even a match on a speeding ticket.

164
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,420
They are ghosts, in a day and age where

165
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,010
that kind of thing's almost impossible.

166
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,870
Okay

167
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,640
You get that I do not work for suits.

168
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,720
What makes you think I want to ruin all my life for?

169
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:28,850
No...

170
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,730
if you do not want do it for me ...

171
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,150
do it for Gibbons.

172
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:40,100
Your country needs you. Mr. Cage. The Triple-X program needs you

173
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,110
It's time to be a patriot.

174
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,480
By whose definition?

175
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:55,280
Last time I was patriotic, I got three strikes.

176
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,430
And there was only one man who believed in the underdog.

177
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:02,620
Patriotism is dead. There are only rebels and tyrants now.

178
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,440
So which are you?

179
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,540
I am Triple-X.

180
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,340
Welcome back, Triple-X.

181
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,920
Where are you going?

182
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:30,740
- London. - Why? What's in London?

183
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,040
Ghosthunter.

184
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,710
And possibly a fur coat.

185
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:18,270
I have forgotten how beautiful the view is up here.

186
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,730
Oh, see you found your coat.

187
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,320
Oh you promise take care of it for me

188
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,970
And I did

189
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,990
I'm looking for someone.

190
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,890
Since when did we have a business relationship?

191
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:34,710
You know, I get caught even touching a computer, my hour is up for 20.

192
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,180
Name your price.

193
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,930
You know I'm good for it.

194
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:44,050
Information like this doesn't have a price.

195
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:46,050
Ainsley, everything has a price.

196
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:48,080
Now, if you don't think you can pull it off,

197
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,260
if you'd lost your edge, just tell me and I'll understand.

198
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,140
You know what it is, Cage?

199
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,370
What?

200
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,170
I used to think you are the man

201
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,870
But now...

202
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,550
I do not know, maybe I feel that you're working for him

203
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,640
Come on

204
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,970
Nobody knows I'm here.

205
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,750
And you know how I am about keeping secrets.

206
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,990
So you say, but Interpol got these listening bugs.

207
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:14,820
I mean, they're practically invisible, real MI-6 kind of shit.

208
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,440
Disappear under your skin, underarms ...

209
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,030
tied around your balls like a Christmas bow.

210
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,660
unwrap me, then

211
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:31,390
You know, studies have proven that sexual consummation irrevocably ruins ...

212
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:34,380
nine out of ten relationships.

213
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,440
Lucky for me, you love to gamble.

214
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,850
Of course

215
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,450
not.

216
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,820
My friends on the other hand, adores the ***

217
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,860
***

218
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,330
The things I do for my country.

219
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,810
Like finding needles in a stack of needles.

220
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:32,180
Even though you are shackled by the queen...

221
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,440
you're still the best of the world.

222
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:35,830
Thank you.

223
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,360
Do yourself a favor. Burn this.

224
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:43,120
The words that I hear out in the streets, these ghosts caused real kind of trouble

225
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,890
They got training and they got funding ...

226
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,970
and they've got no problem running over anyone who gets in their way.

227
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:50,700
I can see you worry that I may get hurt.

228
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,710
I worry that you might get dead.

229
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:57,260
You know, I'm touched you can't imagine a world without me in it.

230
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,350
It would be less fun.

231
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,880
That's all I'm saying.

232
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:20,190
Your ghosts are hanging out in Philippines.

233
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,550
Figures they go to the Pacific.

234
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,250
Some jungle rave that's off the grid.

235
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,610
How the hell did you find them so quickly?

236
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,650
Undercover work.

237
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:09,730
Where is it? What did you do with Pandora's Box?

238
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,400
It's in a safe place.

239
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,740
That was not part of the plan.

240
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:22,970
After all these years, you are still shocked when I improvise?

241
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,520
No. But the mission was to destroy it.

242
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,620
It turns out there's a new mission.

243
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:31,370
I am not going to destroy the one thing that I can use to get what we want.

244
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:34,520
- The world is looking for us, Xiang! - Let them come!

245
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,640
You are worried about pawn sacrifice.

246
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,950
I get my eye on the king.

247
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,250
That's the problem.

248
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,290
You forgot the queen.

249
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:56,940
Royal Air Force Station Lakenheath, United Kingdom

250
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,800
After your success taking down Anarchy 99, Gibbons was handed a blank check.

251
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,140
Which is the long way of saying ...

252
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,310
he got you a new ride

253
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,450
The world went to another place since your death Cage.

254
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,920
On board drones, anti-air countermeasures ...

255
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,230
and fuel tanks big enough to circumnavigate the globe three times ...

256
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:21,030
without even landing.

257
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:28,730
You can check your coat. I promise you no one will dare steal it.

258
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,340
I can guarantee it can't walk off on its own.

259
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:34,990
Wheels up in ten, boys! which means you are already 7 minutes behind.

260
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:38,050
Is she always so much fun or just on special occasions?

261
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,370
No wonder our country in debt trillions of dollars.

262
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,930
Do you really need all these gadgets to get the bad guys?

263
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:55,800
We do not need any of it.

264
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,010
But it make catching more fun.

265
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,820
Xander Cage! Holy shit!

266
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:10,840
Live concert in one night only. This is crazy!

267
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,150
I was at Coachella and Guns N'Roses got back together.

268
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:16,490
but this is way cooler

269
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,880
Well, I was not actually there, but ...

270
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,640
I heard about it, you know?

271
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,360
I'm so talking. Oh my God.

272
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:26,150
Sorry, it's a bad habit. I get started and then ...

273
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:28,550
- I can not stop and I can not ... - Breathe.

274
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,660
Take your time. I know mouth-to-mouth if necessary.

275
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:40,120
Are you kidding me with those guns?

276
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,190
You look like the fucking Terminator!

277
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,960
I'm not talking about the first Terminator ...

278
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,290
but the second Terminator goes back to kill the first terminator.

279
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:47,830
It is the liquid metal guy.

280
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:52,000
Agent Claridge worked closely with Gibbons. She will handle support for the operation.

281
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,560
And a guy like you needs a lot of support.

282
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,010
What are you like? 220? 230?

283
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:00,350
Be honest. 250 is the hardest max for my swing.

284
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,040
- Oh come on. - I'm kidding.

285
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,070
It's not like I have a safe word or anything, it is "kumquat".

286
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,250
I never really think about it.

287
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,550
kumquat

288
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,290
What about you?

289
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,780
"Not safe" isn't in my vocabulary.

290
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,380
Touche, you're the Xander Cage.

291
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,460
Anything you need, Becky can source it within an hour.

292
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,640
Except for any sort of illegal drugs.

293
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,610
Those I'll have in 15 minutes.

294
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:24,890
Kidding.

295
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:30,060
But if you need a *** of purple ***, I'm not the girl to ask.

296
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,230
Okay, Cage, follow me. I'll introduce you to your ground team.

297
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:36,820
- Thank you, Becky. - Of course.

298
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,140
kumquat

299
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:44,260
Here comes the Red Bull freak show.

300
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,270
Xander Cage, I want you to meet Paul...

301
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:48,890
Donovan.

302
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,960
Captain Paul Donovan.

303
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,350
I know you. I saw you on TV.

304
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,880
The president gave him a medal. It must be pretty cool, right?

305
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:02,320
You guys must have some seriously cool stories to tell.

306
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,190
must have seen a lot.

307
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,740
I wonder:

308
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,490
How many have ever pulled a free-style triple back flip?

309
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:13,830
On a BMX bike before? All of you?

310
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:15,840
No, we do not play on bicycles.

311
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,500
Oh, you do not play on bikes?

312
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,570
any of you ever carved an R4

313
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,460
On a snowboard ...

314
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,170
while an avalanche is on your booty?

315
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:28,610
We're soldiers, hotshot, not slackers.

316
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,500
Okay, but you all ...

317
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,620
have HALO jumps over Eastern Europe ...

318
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:37,920
using a standard-issued armor dempolyed parachute system. Am I right?

319
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,120
No.

320
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:42,510
We're not all jack up on Mountain Dew and Red Bull, you asshole.

321
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,640
Where did you find this guy?

322
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,560
Oh there is the first time for everything.

323
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:58,200
What did you just do? I can not believe this shit.

324
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,280
I am not gonna have clowns watch my back.

325
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:05,990
I know I'm gonna regret asking you this, but who would you trust?

326
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:59,810
You know no one has this number.

327
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,840
So what do you up to these days?

328
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,000
Me? Moving in odds.

329
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:08,010

334
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:51,190
It was like that when I got here.

339
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,670
Do you hear me?

340
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,460
That guy got through!

341
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,400
What, Nyjah?

342
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,010
Ray and Burrito.

343
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,750
Chad, how are you, bro?

344
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,510
Roberta. I'll see you later.

345

DATED TAYLOR SWIFT AND LADY GAGA ... IN THE SAME NIGHT

347
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,400
SPECIAL SKILL fun to be around.

348
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:02,250
The good, the bad, the extreme...

349
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,360
and the completely insane

350
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:07,790
This is the team I can work with.

351
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,870
I'll make it easy for you.

352
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,860
These four assholes: very bad guys.

353
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,550
Pandora's Box: very bad thing.

354
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:30,550
You will land at Manila and you will requsition your own transportation to the island.

355
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:33,870
Why don't we just nuke this bitch in oil bean and car, eh?

356
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:37,170
Pandora's Box is one of a kind

357
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:39,130
It needs to be recovered intact.

358
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:41,530
Why? What does it do?

359
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:43,980
- Brainwave scrambler? - It killed Gibbons.

360
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,880
All you need to know. The rest is classfied.

361
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,110
Brainwave scrambler

362
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:49,510
Do you smell that?

363
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,800
It smells like the same shit in a different suit.

364
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,730
You think a dog knows how to work "Frisbee"?

365
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:58,320
The master says "fetch," and the bitch listens.

366
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:01,080
You'd look so sexy with a Frisbee in that mouth.

367
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,620
Sweetheart, this is not a game.

368
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,550
You're all my soldiers now.

369
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:09,630
- I'm not a soldier, I'm a parlour. - Do we look like soldiers?

370
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,330
Oh hell no.

371
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:14,610
- I drop your soldiers over Eastern Europe. - Why did you leave lassie behind?

372
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:17,650
This is my operation! You will listen to me.

373
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,220
The meeting is over.

374
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,390
Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln ... how was the play?

375
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,990
That's super strength body armor.

376
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:41,740
We got to tighten the belt ...

377
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,870
Over here.

378
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,600
I got this on.

379
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:48,810
What are you, my handler?

380
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,590
I am whatever you need.

381
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:52,880
I can handle anything.

382
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,790
And I got a tight grip.

383
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:57,370
And just for you know, I'm not a field agent.

384
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:00,500
I do not go out in the field. Ever.

385
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,730
That's where all the fun is.

386
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:05,480
Fun scares me.

387
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,590
People scare me, guns scare me.

388
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:10,840
People with guns really scare me, If I'm scared I can not do my job.

389
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,990
And if I can't do my job, then people die. And if people die, who does my tech supporting?

390
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:16,620
Literally no one.

391
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,230
But I'll make sure to keep you safe.

392
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:22,190
It ain't easy to keep me safe.

393
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:29,200
Yes, these badboys are my favorites.

394
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,590
They called Exogloves . *** new ground combat initiative.

395
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:37,500
pneumatic pistons drive the gears. qualdruple the speed, and power of the punches.

396
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:40,870
No no.

397
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,960
This is a multi-stage signal disrupter

398
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,460
It is very, very breakable

399
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,820
Can you tell me the real reason behind the crash?

400
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,030
Of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie?

401
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:53,970
Yes.

402
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,070
You're one of them, right?

403
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,510
Hey easy. Rocky.

404
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:01,340
I wasn't kidding when I say it because the force of these badboys

405
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,760
to cut a hole in a fucking plane.

406
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,470
Keep walking around. What can possibly go wrong?

407
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:11,060
- That's my style, though. - Yes, good. glad to hear.

408
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:15,050
You know? Actually...

409
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:18,020
I would rather if you...

410
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,290
That's refreshing. You actually know what you are doing down there.

411
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,190
Yes, that's what she said.

412
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:31,570
Caramoan Islands PHILIPPINES

413
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,470
Let them pass.

414
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,100
Need something, man?

415
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:30,230
I heard this is a perfect place to disappear for a few days ...

416
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:33,630
for my crew, no questions asked

417
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,410
My home is your home, if you pay good price.

418
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,920
Perfect.

419
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:39,170
Tennyson!

420
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:45,010
Figure you like this. I just happen to have the best *** in the South Pacific.

421
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,960
30% of the top gets you a finest hospitality package.

422
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:00,660
30% of the top? Can I get the girls for a weekend and two coconuts?

423
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,080
Ten percent.

424
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,560
10%?

425
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:09,880
I think looking the other island without laws, it happens all the time.

426
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:14,770
I'll tell you what to do. You turn around, go get your boat. You kiss my ass.

427
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:17,570
It's okay. Hanging on.

428
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,280
What do you think?

429
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:20,770
You talked me into it!

430
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,640
Eighteen percent!

431
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:25,390
You think this is a flea market?

432
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:28,980
You think we neighborhoods sell televisions and fake watches or something like that?

433
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:30,950
What's wrong with you, friend?

434
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,390
All right. 22.5%.

435
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,020
How do I give the half?

436
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,530
Twenty two...

437
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:46,210
and a half.

438
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:57,120
Hi man. Enjoy the party.

439
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,710
I like your style, man.

440
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:03,750
Stay on that boat, no matter what.

441
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:05,380
Adele, Nicks!

442
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,760
Well, guys, keep your ear bugs in.

443
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:14,420
Like always, Adele, you're my eyes in the sky.

444
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,090
Nicks, you are gonna show how we did.

445
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,310
You got this?

446
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:44,750
You just watch.

447
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,470
Can you keep this behind the bar, please?

448
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:11,140
What can I get you?

449
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,470
A cranberry club soda.

450
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,120
Make that two.

451
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,830
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

452
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:27,330
Stay focus.

453
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:29,370
Really?

454
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:38,640
Xander Cage. Back in action.

455
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:40,740
Did I ever leave?

456
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,520
Spot that clown.

457
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,740
Easier than we expected. Drinks all around.

458
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:16,410
That's him.

459
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:43,370
***. douche bag hunting season.

460
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:44,850
my favorite.

461
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,480
It is too early in the evening to slay someone.

462
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:50,740
- Let me fix it. - Oh come on.

463
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,400
The *** doesn't deserves a bullet? I think he does.

464
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,620
Is this a party or a funeral?

465
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:05,100
Either way, somebody is going to hang up tonight!

466
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:27,370
Told you he was fun having around.

467
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:56,090
At first I thought Special Forces.

468
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:58,440
But your inks all wrong.

469
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:00,620
CIA?

470
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:04,080
They would send in a drone to bomb us to hell.

471
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:05,910
MI6?

472
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:09,150
You are not kind of subtlety they prefer

473
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:15,280
You know the men who come to this island. They're on the run.

474
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:17,770
Hiding from the world.

475
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,810
But not you.

476
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:22,220
You are not here to hide.

477
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:24,710
You're looking for someone.

478
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:31,390
Who says I haven't already find it?

479
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:38,250
Do you want to scare me?

480
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:40,460
a little tremble will be nice.

481
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,120
Well...

482
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:46,890
considering one tremble to make you run away from here...

483
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:51,750
I'd say I'm close enough.

484
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,690
Does this means you're not making any breakfast in the morning?

485
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:00,490
I'd say a couple of inches off.

486
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:08,220
Bit of a stalemate.

487
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:10,050
Not if you drop the gun

488
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:12,450
I'm not the bad guy.

489
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:16,100
I don't believe in good guys.

490
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,240
Serena?

491
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,200
Who is he?

492
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:25,790
We just met.

493
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,610
But we got along famously until somebody ...

494
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:31,880
decided to interrupt

495
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:33,570
stick to the path

496
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:35,670
Here honey

497
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:38,690
There are a lot of unmarked graves on the island.

498
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:44,390
And I'll bet whoever sold you that shirt is one of them.

499
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:47,940
How long do you intend to push a look?

500
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,480
Until I get what I came for.

501
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:53,430
which is what exactly?

502
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:58,670
A damn stiff drink.

503
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:25,550
So, let's be real and talk about what we all really want.

504
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:34,820
I am only here for that.

505
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,640
In my minds, you guys can walk away nicely. unless you want to continue our foreplay?

506
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:42,890
Power like that doesn't belong in anyone's hands.

507
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:46,640
Just improvising.

508
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:58,550
Seriously? A grenade? What is this? Eastern Europe in 1990s?

509
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:00,190
Next, he's gonna send you a fax.

510
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:03,030
So you are willing to kill?

511
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:05,830
Just to keep that for yourself?

512
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:07,670
That's a wrong question to ask.

513
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:10,640
What's the right question?

514
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:14,670
"Are you willing to die for it?"

515
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:23,030
One grenade, three people.

516
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,840
I like the odds.

517
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:33,450
Two grenades, three people.

518
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,520
I'm loving these odds.

519
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:44,470
Have you never bled so much that when you open your eyes, all you see is red?

520
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:47,380
When you have fought in wars on every continent.

521
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:51,960
Come on X, just say the word, Let me put both these two arseholes out in the pasture.

522
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:53,380
Except death.

523
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:55,540
Our bodies are such fragile.

524
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:56,940
Let me shoot him.

525
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:58,650
Death sometimes just...

526
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:01,160
sneak on you

527
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,700
It's been a while since I played hot potato.

528
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:07,510
I'm in a hospital bed.

529
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:11,570
I'm barely conscious, delirious. Drowning in my own blood.

530
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:15,240
And all I can hear myself to think is "Today is the day"

531
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:17,200
"Today is the day you die"

532
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:19,960
I'm touched.

533
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:21,910
Can I have my jacket?

534
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:24,160
There is a man comes along, tells me the story ...

535
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:27,380
about a drought in California.

536
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:30,440
About skateboards and swimming pools.

537
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:34,180
About a man named Xander Cage.

538
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:37,010
Oh shit. He is Triple-X.

539
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:42,860
I heard he was dead.

540
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:47,540
Is he?

541
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:52,110
We are all Triple-X.

542
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:55,040
We just have different agenda.

543
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:57,500
She wants to destroy it.

544
00:49:58,910 --> 00:49:59,910
I'm going to use it.

545
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:05,090
And I will be damned if I am gonna let you take it back to NSA

546
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:12,970
Secret

547
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:29,030
Now it's a party.

548
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,330
Shit's about to go down.

549
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:53,040
You think that is for fun?

550
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:56,210
Turn off the music!

551
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:57,730
Stop it!

552
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,760
Everybody hands up!

553
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:10,050
Now!

554
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:12,310
On the floor!

555
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:16,700
First person to move, first person to die!

556
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:24,740
I moved.

557
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,050
I moved again.

558
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:33,730
I am still alive.

559
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:35,830
Shut up, "hero"!

560
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,070
All right.

561
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,240
Let's do this.

562
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:41,530
Do not move!

563
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:47,550
Well, I actually have what you want.

564
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:49,800
Pandora's box?

565
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,160
I got it right here.

566
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,200
But you're wrong though.

567
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:57,840
You take it from me, and you die first.

568
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:01,310
Then Lieutenant Leningrad, thinks he got you back

569
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:03,370
Then the two Ivans by the door.

570
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:06,180
Moscow Mule by the bar.

571
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:10,400
Then Igor on the stairs.

572
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,880
See where we are going with this?

573
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:16,340
But none of that matters.

574
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:19,280
Because like I said ...

575
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:24,100
if you take this from me, you die first.

576
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,140
I will take it from you, dead or alive.

577
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:33,570
If you hold it too tight, they cut your arm off.

578
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:35,470
Suit yourself.

579
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:45,820
Leningrad.

580
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:47,250
Hello Ivan.

581
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:48,600
The other Ivan.

582
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,450
Goodbye, Moscow Mule.

583
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:08,010
Igor. It's another one you owe me. X.

584
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:10,290
Read between the lines.

585
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:29,770
Tennyson! Some back will be nice.

586
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:32,910
Some back will be nice! Come on man!

587
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,830
X says I stay on the boat.

588
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:41,460
That was before the goddamn Russian invasion takes down ,man!

589
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,010
X says stay on the boat.

590
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:36,810
Do you want to play?

591
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:20,670
That doesn't belong in anyone's hands.

592
00:57:21,590 --> 00:57:24,430
If you want it. Come and get it.

593
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:30,090
Was that necessary?

594
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,540
It's what Gibbons would have wanted.

595
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,280
X!

596
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:42,860
X.

597
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:45,590
It happened again. Another satellite fell.

598
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:51,030
How's working as a team?

599
00:57:52,350 --> 00:57:54,460
That's what Gibbons would have wanted.

600
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:58,180
You in?

601
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:03,110
An explosion inside the Olympic Stadium rocks Moscow

602
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:04,980
Seven workers are now confirmed dead.

603
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:09,190
With at least 25 others injured in this senseless act of violence.

604
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:11,590
A source inside the Pentagon says ...

605
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:15,900
a rouge satellite may have been used as a weapon.

606
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:19,980
This means that Pandora's Box is not exactly classified.

607
00:58:20,450 --> 00:58:23,620
In a new video, released just moments ago, an anonymous group ...

608
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:27,980
is claiming to have the ability to use satellites as weapons. They claimed

609
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:32,600
quote "The violation of civil liberties of all citizens of the world ...

610
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:35,030
It is an atrocity that must be stopped "

611
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:40,380
Disable and dismantle all the world spy programs within the next 24 hours ...

612
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:43,770
or I will do it for you one satellite at a time.

613
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:46,910
There are 30,000 satellites orbiting the Earth at this moment.

614
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:51,850
I will drop one satellite every 24 hours until my demands are met.

615
00:58:52,370 --> 00:58:53,540
eyewitnesses in Moscow ...

616
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,540
- Was this always part of mission to you? - Of course not.

617
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:01,010
We were a new Triple-X team Gibbons created.

618
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:05,590
We discovered a high-level intelligence officer who was trying to manipulate satellites.

619
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:08,190
And even before we could unmask him

620
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:10,110
Gibbons was killed.

621
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,470
So you knew they were Triple-X all along

622
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:14,980
I needed you to retain a sense of objectivity.

623
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:19,260
I don't understand. If I destroyed Pandora's Box. What happened in Moscow?

624
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:21,600
If I am right, which I am ...

625
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:25,140
this box only had the ability to control one satellite.

626
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:26,690
What does that mean?

627
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:29,350
It means we have been chasing a prototype.

628
00:59:29,790 --> 00:59:32,310
- And these guys have the real one? - Yes.

629
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:43,740
Serena played us like fools.

630
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:46,380
betrayed us.

631
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:50,180
This is not about Serena. This is a war.

632
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:55,010
And either we stop today or we watch the world burn tomorrow. can't lose focus on that.

633
00:59:57,130 --> 00:59:59,910
Where were you have you been? You stopped ***

634
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:01,930
Your mom says hi.

635
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:04,480
tracker on board? Nobody saw you?

636
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:06,710
- No one ever sees me, boss - good.

637
01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:11,090
These suits control every spy satellites in the sky.

638
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:15,700
But, how often these seven men all sit in the same room together?

639
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:17,450
Almost never

640
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:20,610
And if you needed retinal scans ...

641
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:25,620
cellphone data dumps, biometrics of all the superpowers in the world...

642
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:28,230
Who would you target?

643
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:29,530
Shit

644
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:33,260
Who has that kind of power to actually set that in motion?

645
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:38,270
You're pissing up the wrong tree, Cage. I came looking for you, remember?

646
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:41,230
Oh, asshole.  We are going to have problems?

647
01:00:41,740 --> 01:00:44,060
Oh no problem. How was your trip?

648
01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:46,850
I'm just doing the maths.

649
01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:49,160
Oh yeah? What maths?

650
01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:52,590
Air velocity divided by distance.

651
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:56,840
So when I stuff you down the toilet, the search and rescue...

652
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,640
know where to find you between China and North Korea.

653
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:01,140
keep talking shit, man.

654
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:03,220
Hold that thought, GI Joe.

655
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:06,950
Roll it back

656
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:09,490
A little more.

657
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:10,680
more

658
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:14,730
A little more. stop.

659
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:17,530
Okay, when Xiang broke the window ...

660
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,800
He is the only one that did not flinch.

661
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:27,230
I need the president on the phone immediately

662
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:31,260
That's not gonna scrub off. You know that right? It was a quantum screen!

663
01:01:31,710 --> 01:01:34,980
It seems that the director of the CIA has been trying to destroy the world for years.

664
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:38,770
We have carte blanche to track this son of bitch down

665
01:01:39,370 --> 01:01:41,610
Do any of you know how to do it?

666
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:44,620
The same way Xiang and I found Pandora's Box in New York.

667
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:51,270
Pandora's box needs to be reconnecting itself because of the satellites orbit.

668
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:52,750
Excuse me.

669
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:55,960
All what we need to do is to track down the main signals.

670
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:59,140
and then we can approximate its location within a 20 mile radius.

671
01:02:04,810 --> 01:02:06,840
Of all the places in the world ...

672
01:02:07,330 --> 01:02:09,410
this fruit choose Detroit?

673
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:21,210
The blasts did take place in Moscow, but they were felt around the world.

674
01:02:21,810 --> 01:02:25,630
In the morning, *** the death toll of Moscow's tragedy has rised.

675
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:32,150
Let me guess. Everyone's jumping at the chance to dismantle their spy program.

676
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:34,430
No.

677
01:02:35,070 --> 01:02:38,590
The world is too stupid to realize that Moscow was a bluff.

678
01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:45,370
Okay, Triple-X, you will base at an NSA safe house.

679
01:02:45,790 --> 01:02:50,320
Becky will coordinate your bug communications, and have the signal disrupter on standby.

680
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:53,980
Mate, when I crashed the boat on shore to save your life ...

681
01:02:54,590 --> 01:02:55,670
Whatever bro

682
01:02:56,110 --> 01:03:00,810
Do you think that counts as crash #199 for me? You know, officially?

683
01:03:01,430 --> 01:03:03,100
Officially, you're deranged

684
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:07,030
Cool.

685
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,480
We will set up a triangulated signal tracking system around the city

686
01:03:10,730 --> 01:03:14,100
When Becky locks in its exact location, we make our move.

687
01:03:14,910 --> 01:03:17,760
What about you? How did you get involved in all this?

688
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:21,240
I dangled the skyscraper, and go to a year jail for it.

689
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:23,390
Jail?

690
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:26,560
Seems excessive.

691
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:29,240
The *** was 30 storeys tall.

692
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:31,680
Two million hits on YouTube.

693
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:34,000
And I served only half the sentence.

694
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:37,390
Let me guess. Gibbons to the rescue.

695
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:40,700
He said a lion like me doesn't belong in any kind of cage.

696
01:03:48,670 --> 01:03:52,030
I got mine after I left NSA.

697
01:03:52,730 --> 01:03:55,170
- What about that one your wrist? - London.

698
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:58,640
In 2009 climbed the Millennium Wheel.

699
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:00,670
Naked.

700
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:02,090
- Naked? - Yeah.

701
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,190
High school.

702
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,620
Oh no!

703
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:10,790
We all have our embarrassing moments.

704
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:15,880
What about that sexy one?

705
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:19,210
This? The phoenix out of the ashes.

706
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:21,510
18 hours in a chair in Mexico.

707
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:23,850
drank my body in tequila to get through it.

708
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:27,440
It is the most important one actually

709
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:32,130
It is when I decided to change the world instead of ...

710
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:34,050
rage against it.

711
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:41,990
We found him. We found Pandora's Box.

712
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:44,360
Xander, do you copy?

713
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,700
We are here. Okay, send Tennyson.

714
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:51,700
Looks like East 404, Congress streets. He is on the top floor.

715
01:04:59,010 --> 01:05:00,200
SELECT SATELLITE

716
01:05:02,250 --> 01:05:04,720
I'm sure activity with Pandora's Box. I can jam signal

717
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:08,120
but only a few minutes, so hurry.

718
01:05:11,470 --> 01:05:13,660
You got to get there fast and take this guy down.

719
01:05:17,810 --> 01:05:20,020
Not if we find him first.

720
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:28,520
Red light!

721
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:37,590
You know traffic signals are invented by big oil to waste fuel, drive up profits.

722
01:05:37,890 --> 01:05:40,750
If I say "yes", would you please slow down? Look out!

723
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:44,300
Wait.

724
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:49,110
Is this the part where you anticipate, then you got your eye on me, you don't trust me?

725
01:05:49,470 --> 01:05:51,050
Welcome to the moment.

726
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:06,340
Everyone needs back up.

727
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:11,120
Stop!

728
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:12,430
Stop!

729
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:18,850
Tennyson?

730
01:06:21,050 --> 01:06:22,610
A gridlock.

731
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:24,990
There it is.

732
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:28,060
If you run into trouble ...

733
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:29,830
dial nine.

734
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:31,950
It is an old Gibbons fail safe.

735
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:50,100
You crashed my party! stole my dance partner!

736
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:52,390
I will crash yours.

737
01:06:52,690 --> 01:06:53,690
Have fun.

738
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:56,350
This is not a party. This is a race.

739
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:12,450
- What the hell think you are you doing? - building a ramp.

740
01:07:23,830 --> 01:07:25,080
Go go go.

741
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,730
out of car! get out!

742
01:08:07,930 --> 01:08:08,930
- What are you doing? - Let's go!

743
01:09:12,130 --> 01:09:13,860
He is trying to reconnect.

744
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:18,320
Guys, I can only jam the signal for so long before he chooses another satellite. You have to hurry.

745
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,480
I have a plan.

746
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:24,630
Hold on!

747
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:26,430
"Hold on" is no goddamn a plan!

748
01:09:46,870 --> 01:09:47,870
Hi.

749
01:09:48,990 --> 01:09:50,440
Are you looking for someone?

750
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:02,270
That's 200!

751
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,070
Haha, come on.

752
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:32,760
No! Xander, you guys have to got to the top floor. He is trying to engage another satellite.

753
01:10:32,970 --> 01:10:33,970
Hurry!

754
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:49,600
fish in the barrel

755
01:11:03,730 --> 01:11:04,950
45 U.S.P

756
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:06,930
12 round mag.

757
01:11:08,570 --> 01:11:09,770
five left

758
01:11:15,820 --> 01:11:16,820
Three.

759
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,170
What the hell is going on out there?

760
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:47,170
Empty.

761
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:14,330
I got Xander in! Find the target, light them up.

762
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:19,970
Gibbons thought you'd be back.

763
01:12:21,130 --> 01:12:23,180
To be the hero we needed.

764
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:29,630
you take the box to NSA

765
01:12:30,030 --> 01:12:31,910
we are right back to where we started.

766
01:12:38,780 --> 01:12:40,390
This is touching.

767
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:45,440
Gibbons would be proud to see you two working together.

768
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:54,860
walking out of here, Xander.

769
01:12:58,160 --> 01:12:59,790
you wanna know secret?

770
01:13:00,430 --> 01:13:02,180
You forgot to put deodorant on?

771
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:07,460
I killed Gibbons because he was a self-righteous prick.

772
01:13:08,020 --> 01:13:09,220
Do you have a shot?

773
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,580
Adele, do you have eyes on the target?

774
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:14,250
I am switching to the thermal.

775
01:13:14,450 --> 01:13:17,400
I was never going to stop downing satellites

776
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:22,590
no matter what happened, you know why, because this world has turned ...

777
01:13:22,790 --> 01:13:24,900
Please, please tell me you have a shot

778
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:26,390
Damn it.

779
01:13:26,530 --> 01:13:28,640
He has turned the heat up. I can't see shit

780
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:31,260
X, can't see you guys. thermal is not good.

781
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:33,310
- Right? - I lost them in the heat.

782
01:13:33,510 --> 01:13:35,700
you want to see what's going on in this world?

783
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,720
- What are you gonna do about it? - easy.

784
01:13:40,770 --> 01:13:44,710
X. Keep him talking. I still don't have a shot

785
01:13:45,010 --> 01:13:48,920
We made it that way, people like Gibbons and two of you. And me.

786
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,060
We made it that way.

787
01:13:51,630 --> 01:13:55,160
What's the point of getting up in the morning if you're not gonna reboot the world

788
01:13:55,460 --> 01:13:56,570
right, okay, easy

789
01:13:56,770 --> 01:13:59,930
There's a war out there, a world war for our survival.

790
01:14:00,330 --> 01:14:02,450
You don't see it? Millions of people have died for nothing!

791
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:05,100
Read between the lines.

792
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:07,680
- Come on, isn't it right? - I'm going to be honest with you.

793
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:09,980
What has been bugging me this whole time

794
01:14:11,450 --> 01:14:14,880
is you have got something stuck in between your teeth.

795
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:17,620
- What? What the hell are you talking about? - I'm serious.

796
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,030
What the hell is wrong with you?

797
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:21,580
Right ... there.

798
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,400
Nice shot.

799
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:31,330
Was it ever a doubt?

800
01:14:31,870 --> 01:14:34,400
Yes, I confess I had my doubts.

801
01:14:37,130 --> 01:14:39,820
That's for talking shit about my friend Gibbons.

802
01:14:51,250 --> 01:14:54,280
Xiang! Get on your knees! On your knees!

803
01:14:55,620 --> 01:14:57,570
Hands! Hands!

804
01:14:58,270 --> 01:14:59,480
On your knees! Now!

805
01:15:01,910 --> 01:15:03,550
Just in time.

806
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:10,110
Watch out. Cage. keep this up, people might mistake you for one of the good guys.

807
01:15:13,450 --> 01:15:14,950
Hey, Suit.

808
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,030
You got what you wanted.

809
01:15:21,910 --> 01:15:23,600
We both know that he is not the bad guy.

810
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,420
You know who would we blame for Moscow?

811
01:15:26,130 --> 01:15:29,610
Better a living terrorist than a dead company man.

812
01:15:29,810 --> 01:15:31,380
See what I'm saying?

813
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:32,440
Let's go.

814
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:34,860
Back on the plane. I want wheels up in twenty.

815
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:36,200
Let's go boys.

816
01:15:42,310 --> 01:15:44,310
We recover Pandora's Box.

817
01:15:44,610 --> 01:15:47,250
They will send an extraction team to pick you guys up.

818
01:15:47,450 --> 01:15:49,180
But they are taking Xiang.

819
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:51,840
And Serena ...

820
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:54,940
you don't hear from me, remember, dial 9.

821
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:57,150
X takes care of its own.

822
01:15:57,610 --> 01:15:59,530
You gave it back to Marke, didn't you?

823
01:16:09,830 --> 01:16:12,950
nice place. spacious, expensive.

824
01:16:13,250 --> 01:16:14,350
Shut up.

825
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:25,100
Thank you, sir.

826
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:28,600
Yes, minimal casualties. Triple-X performed ...

827
01:16:28,810 --> 01:16:31,400
beyond any reasonable measured expectation.

828
01:16:45,150 --> 01:16:46,730
Let me guess.

829
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:50,400
That was my invitation to the Oval Office.

830
01:16:55,170 --> 01:16:58,590
10 minutes ago, the Triple-X program was officially shuttered.

831
01:16:59,090 --> 01:17:03,350
All active agents should be erased from record, and considered enemies of the state.

832
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:08,300
It is just never a good idea to point a gun on me.

833
01:17:13,270 --> 01:17:17,010
NSA extraction teams normally armed like they invading Fallujah?

834
01:17:17,410 --> 01:17:19,530
No, generally not. Watch the boys.

835
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:23,840
Shit.

836
01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:28,290
Oh, it's happening, isn't it? They're going to shoot at us, aren't they?

837
01:17:28,590 --> 01:17:29,970
- Let's go!

838
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:32,440
It's showtime.

839
01:17:32,610 --> 01:17:34,220
I guess we are on the same team now.

840
01:17:34,420 --> 01:17:35,660
Give me one.

841
01:17:37,430 --> 01:17:41,360
You know me. Wind me up, pointing the right direction.

842
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:43,050
Let's go!

843
01:17:43,350 --> 01:17:46,970
That shit is getting real! Does this happen when shit goes real?

844
01:17:47,170 --> 01:17:48,360
What do we do?

845
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,650
Just with bullets on.

846
01:17:51,270 --> 01:17:54,380
Sadly, the terriost activated Pandora's Box ...

847
01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:57,250
one last time before we could stop him.

848
01:17:57,550 --> 01:18:02,090
you and your entire team lost in the blast along with the device itself.

849
01:18:03,190 --> 01:18:05,920
If the world thinks Pandora's Box has gone

850
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:09,060
then they won't know we are using it to spy on them.

851
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:10,950
You're just another tyrant.

852
01:18:11,450 --> 01:18:13,230
No. patriot.

853
01:18:13,530 --> 01:18:15,490
Let me educate you on the difference.

854
01:18:16,190 --> 01:18:17,190
Xander!

855
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:20,860
Xander!

856
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:30,050
They say it is the last great adventure, cage. Be sure send me a postcard.

857
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:31,820
- engines hot! - Oh right let's go!

858
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:33,120
Xander!

859
01:18:33,860 --> 01:18:35,080
Xander Cage!

860
01:18:39,150 --> 01:18:40,750
- Go, go! - Everybody spread out!

861
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:42,960
Take cover! Move!

862
01:18:46,170 --> 01:18:47,760
There, take cover!

863
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:08,690
What a rush.

864
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:12,410
Damn, Becky, that's a body armor.

865
01:19:17,590 --> 01:19:20,810
Hey, I told you that you got no manners.

866
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:24,800
Did your mother ever teach you how to zip up your pants?

867
01:19:33,220 --> 01:19:34,220
Well

868
01:19:44,270 --> 01:19:45,270
Serena.

869
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:47,130
We're a bit busy now!

870
01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:51,410
Marke has got Pandora's Box. She is gonna drop a satellite on top of you.

871
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:55,060
She is going to drop a satellite on us!

872
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:58,310
Not if I jam the signal!

873
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:02,680
I need a power source!

874
01:20:04,420 --> 01:20:05,420
Go!

875
01:20:05,570 --> 01:20:07,410
Over there? By myself?

876
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:12,740
Go!

877
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:15,150
Cover me!

878
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:22,970
Hurry up! Over there!

879
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:36,090
I'll go low.

880
01:20:36,390 --> 01:20:37,710
I'll go high.

881
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:40,460
See if we can find G.I. Joe.

882
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:07,080
Are you getting signal interference?

883
01:21:59,710 --> 01:22:00,830
Shit.

884
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,190
Everyone needs back up, right?

885
01:22:13,650 --> 01:22:15,190
Yeah, I guess.

886
01:22:51,110 --> 01:22:52,510
Let's do this.

887
01:23:47,770 --> 01:23:49,020
Nicks!

888
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:51,950
- I got a plan. - No!

889
01:23:53,690 --> 01:23:54,760
No!

890
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:18,650
Listen, from now on, I make the plans, you act ***!

891
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:27,780
Oh shit.

892
01:26:09,810 --> 01:26:12,710
Oh my god, this is fucking awesome!

893
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:29,630
What's wrong asshole? Why do you come back?

894
01:26:29,930 --> 01:26:32,550
No, I just finally figure out that maths problem.

895
01:26:46,250 --> 01:26:48,540
It's gonna take two flushes.

896
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:57,930
Oh shit, way too many. Let's get out of here.

897
01:27:00,250 --> 01:27:01,280
Get back

898
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:03,960
Oh shit

899
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,230
I don't want to die

900
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:14,890
Forward, push!

901
01:27:17,150 --> 01:27:18,760
This is all we've got.

902
01:27:22,110 --> 01:27:23,960
I am out of bullets! You got any?

903
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:25,980
No, nothing.

904
01:27:28,390 --> 01:27:29,510
I am empty!

905
01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:35,350
We go on three.

906
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:19,340
What's up?

907
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:25,940
Rock, paper, scissors ... grenade launcher.

908
01:28:28,140 --> 01:28:29,320
Darius Stone.

909
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:31,440
DARIUS STONE XXX SINCE 2005

910
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:33,050
Former US Navy SEAL OFFICER

911
01:28:33,070 --> 01:28:36,020
Spent last 11 YEARS WAITING FOR SOMEONE to Dial 9

912
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:38,280
Triple-X since 2005.

913
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:40,370
Thanks for the assist!

914
01:28:40,670 --> 01:28:42,260
X takes care of its own.

915
01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:15,500
You got to be kidding.

916
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:35,040
SELECT SATELLITE

917
01:29:48,830 --> 01:29:50,090
We failed.

918
01:29:55,490 --> 01:29:58,900
Xander, Marke activated the satellite and it headed towards us.

919
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:01,430
I'm gonna have to take it to kamikaze style.

920
01:30:01,630 --> 01:30:04,850
Do not do it. It is suicide. Nobody could survive that fall.

921
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:07,280
Tell Nicks have that camera ready.

922
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:10,610
Low alto free fall, no chute and a big fireworks

923
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:19,140
They say it is the last great adventure.

924
01:30:31,770 --> 01:30:33,590
Make sure send a postcard.

925
01:30:57,380 --> 01:30:58,720
I live for this shit

926
01:31:14,730 --> 01:31:15,730
Shit.

927
01:32:32,470 --> 01:32:33,560
Nicks!

928
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:35,750
I hope you got that on camera.

929
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:40,940
If it ain't no video, it did not happen!

930
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:44,110
Oh, yeah. Hall of Fame right here, bro.

931
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:48,490
- You know, I could have done that, right? - Bullshit.

932
01:32:51,470 --> 01:32:52,920
What happened to Marke?

933
01:32:53,250 --> 01:32:54,920
The ground broke her fall.

934
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:25,280
Still you do not believe in good guys?

935
01:33:26,710 --> 01:33:28,840
It is okay to feel a little bad.

936
01:33:35,410 --> 01:33:36,930
How bad?

937
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:08,980
Now, that right there...

938
01:34:09,650 --> 01:34:11,740
that was a hell of an entrance

939
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:14,710
That's a hell of car.

940
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:18,690
Gibbons told me to keep an eye on it.

941
01:34:18,990 --> 01:34:21,680
He said I would know why when I need to know why.

942
01:34:23,570 --> 01:34:25,030
now I know why.

943
01:34:25,450 --> 01:34:27,690
It is exactly the way I left it.

944
01:34:27,990 --> 01:34:29,640
took it on a date or two

945
01:34:30,980 --> 01:34:32,910
X takes care of its own.

946
01:34:33,110 --> 01:34:35,100
That's why I figured you'll come through.

947
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:38,670
To get a chance to work with the legendary Xander Cage?

948
01:34:38,910 --> 01:34:40,600
Where do I sign up?

949
01:34:49,170 --> 01:34:54,030
You know you pissed a wrong damn picnic

950
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:56,530
The whole world will be looking for us

951
01:35:01,370 --> 01:35:03,650
I wouldn't have any other way.

952
01:36:38,870 --> 01:36:42,220
We thought we could end with Augustus' favorite song.

953
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:43,910
That's an impressive trick.

954
01:36:45,990 --> 01:36:48,040
Think you are the only one knows how to play dead?

955
01:36:50,810 --> 01:36:51,930
Gotcha.

956
01:36:56,010 --> 01:36:58,890
It's pretty surreal to be on my own funeral.

957
01:36:59,180 --> 01:37:01,630
And I think to myself:

958
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:04,930
What a wonderful World

959
01:37:05,550 --> 01:37:07,950
I love that song.

960
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:12,170
And it could be a wonderful world ...

961
01:37:12,570 --> 01:37:14,690
if we stop doing bad shit to it.

962
01:37:17,260 --> 01:37:20,080
If you wanted me out of retirement, you could have just asked, man.

963
01:37:20,700 --> 01:37:24,310
You've always responded to less subtle motivation.

964
01:37:26,510 --> 01:37:27,520
now what?

965
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:30,720
You keep being a rebel the world doesn't know it needs.

966
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:34,630
Watches the watchers, fight the enemy within.

967
01:37:34,830 --> 01:37:36,720
Damn, that's so complicated.

968
01:37:36,910 --> 01:37:38,000
Really?

969
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:40,900
Let me simplify for you.

970
01:37:41,390 --> 01:37:43,220
kick some ass

971
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:44,870
Get the girl.

972
01:37:45,620 --> 01:37:48,930
And try to look dope while you are doing it.

973
01:37:50,850 --> 01:37:52,850
You can do dope, can't you?

974
01:37:54,330 --> 01:37:55,950
Sure you can.

975
01:38:00,470 --> 01:38:01,470
Junior, let's go!

976
01:38:01,670 --> 01:38:03,860
I will see you there, X.

977
01:38:09,390 --> 01:38:11,490
I can definitely make that work.

978
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:22,100
