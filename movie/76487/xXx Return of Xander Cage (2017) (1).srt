1
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,490
知道我是如何想出 极限特工这个计划
You know how I came up with the idea for the Triple-X program?

2
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,780
滑板和泳池
Skateboards and swimming pools.

3
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,950
奥古斯·吉本斯 极限特工创办人

4
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,620
凭一己之力终结了第三次世界大战

5
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,460
滑板动作曾被局限在地面上 是属于青少年的交通工具
Skateboards used to be stuck on the ground. Adolescent transportation.

6
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,300
但在1977年改革了
Then 1977 happens.

7
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,760
南加州遭遇了特大旱灾
Big drought hits Southern California.

8
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,090
灾情之重 连那些有钱佬别墅的泳池都没有水
Got so bad, rich suburbanites couldn't afford to fill their swimming pools.

9
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,810
在这时候 有个小子灵机一动…
That's when the light clicked on. Some kid figured out

10
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,140
他想到自己可以在 空荡荡的泳池里用滑板半空跳跃
he could skate those empty pools and get some real nasty air.

11
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,150
你有看过电影 《狗镇和滑板少年》
Dogtown and Z-Boys. You ever seen it? It's a movie.

12
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,150
无所谓
Doesn't matter.

13
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,530
反正我们这位英雄 开始在滑板上…
Anyhow, our hero starts doing things on a board

14
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,030
做出各种 没人见识过的花招
that no one's ever seen before.

15
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,790
那是这世界上 意想不到的事
Things the world thought were impossible.

16
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,460
对那小子而言 干旱来的正是时候
Now, that kid needed that drought.

17
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,130
这世界也急需 那些空荡荡的泳池
The world needed those empty pools.

18
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,790
极限特工便诞生了
That's why Triple-X.

19
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,960
小内马尔 极限特工积极招聘者

20
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,050
擅长脚下功夫的天才 20岁时已射进100个龙门

21
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:45,140
他以为是被复仇者联盟征召

22
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,520
你今天比昨天感觉更有安全感吗 我倒不觉得如此
Do you feel safer today than you felt yesterday? I know I don't.

23
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,980
美军是这世上 最雄伟以及昂贵的军队…
The biggest, most expensive military in the world,

24
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,310
我们却被恐怖份子 惹得不得安宁
and we're still scared of shoe and tighty-whitey bombs at the airport.

25
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,690
为何会如此
Why is that?

26
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,360
因为士兵是训练来 服从命令和抗战
Because soldiers are built to take orders and fight wars.

27
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,370
但是 朋友 我们面临的并非战争
But we, my friend, are not at war.

28
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,200
我们面对的是恐怖威胁
We are at peril.

29
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,040
极限特工便诞生了
That's why Triple-X.

30
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,670
怎么了 你在节食 你不饿
What's the matter? You on a diet? You ain't hungry?

31
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,480
现在是早晨7点半
It's 7:30 in the morning.

32
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,340
那又如何 在世界的某处 已是午餐或晚餐时间了 吃吧
So? It's lunch or dinnertime somewhere in the world. Come on, eat up!

33
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:25,680
你知道谁才感觉到安全 手握公权者
You know who does feel safe? The men in charge. The world beaters.

34
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,930
掌握着权力的有钱人
The top-shelf, par excellence ayatollahs with all the dollahs.

35
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,680
因为那些混蛋 自以为合乎正道…
And that's because those righteous bastards, somewhere along the way,

36
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:38,020
与魔鬼做了交易 他们以自由来交换安全…
made a deal with the devil. They traded liberty for safety. And us,

37
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,520
而我们人民…
we the people,

38
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,190
却赔上了自由和安全 极限特工便诞生了
ended up losing both. That's why Triple-X.

39
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,530
正当大家还被 局限在地面时…
While everybody else is stuck on the ground,

40
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,200
我们已经在秀出各种 前所未闻的滑板花招
we're doing shit on the board nobody's ever even seen before.

41
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,040
这就是我的推销策略
Well, that's my pitch.

42
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,540
我当间谍远胜于 当个销售员
I always was a better spy than a salesman.

43
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,540
所以…你意下如何
So, what do you say?

44
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:01,210
我不是英雄 我只是一名足球员
I'm not a hero. I'm just a footballer.

45
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,380
那是我搞错了
My bad.

46
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,550
我不妨碍你了
So, Ill leave you be, then.

47
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,140
谁说这世上没有 免费的…一餐
Who said there's no such thing as a free meal?

48
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,570
全都趴下 把钱交出来
Down on the ground, now! Give me the money!

49
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,240
别动
Don't move! Hurry up!

50
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:29,740
动作快
Hurry up!

51
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,160
射进龙门
Goal!

52
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,500
你还说自己不是英雄
And you say you're no hero.

53
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,920
那真是一派胡言
I got to call bullshit on that!

54
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,680
你正是这世界需要 的英雄人物
You're exactly the kind of hero the world needs.

55
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,180
一切事物总归来说 还是围绕着同一个问题…
At the end of the day, it comes down to the same question

56
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,940
我在二十年以来 每个周五晚上都会问我太太
I've been asking my wife every Friday night for the last 20 years.

57
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,100
你想要亲热吗
Do you want some of this?

58
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,110
还是想要…
Or are you just gonna...

59
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,990
《极限特工3：终极回归》

60
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,000
纽约市 中央情报局总部

61
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,520
批准
Access granted.

62
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,490
请坐
Okay, you may sit.

63
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,080
各位…
Gentlemen,

64
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:03,670
这套仪器搞垮了卫星 也杀死了吉本斯
this is the device that crashed the satellite and killed Gibbons.

65
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,090
实验室内的知识份子 称这为"潘多拉魔盒"
Nerds in the lab have coined it "Pandora's Box.!!

66
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,350
我的团队回溯出 卫星最后信号来自迈阿密
My team backtracked the satellite's last signal input to Miami.

67
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,060
在丽思卡尔顿顶层公寓享乐的某位混蛋
Some asshole living the high life at the Ritz-Carlton penthouse

68
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,690
以为他可以只手遮天
thought he could hold the world ransom.

69
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,690
三颗眩晕手榴弹 两颗子弹 以及一个尸体袋后…
Three flashbangs, two bullets, and one body bag later,

70
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,440
我们接管了这套仪器
we took custody of the device.

71
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,700
我们设下了上百个 合适的冗余…
We must have over 100 redundancies in place

72
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,870
防止任何持有笔记本电脑 的骇客劫持卫星
to prevent some punk with a laptop from hijacking satellites.

73
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:39,240
潘多拉魔盒却能 轻易绕过所有防守设施
And Pandora's Box can bypass all of them.

74
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,420
只要按下按钮 就能轻易窃听保密通信…
With the push of a button, it can eavesdrop on secure communications,

75
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:50,880
损坏军事软件 传输虚假智能情报…
corrupt military software, transmit false intelligence, or

76
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,890
或是像该死的核武器 从天空中撞出一颗卫星
crash a satellite out of the sky like a goddamn tactical warhead.

77
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,760
这仪器一定 出自你们其中一人
One of you is behind this.

78
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,730
我在查出之前 誓不罢休
And I am not leaving here until I find out who.

79
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,860
你用书本来攻击我
You fight me with a book?

80
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,820
来吧 兄弟 第一章
Here you go, brother. Chapter one!

81
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:34,990
第一页
Page one!

82
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,240
世事难料
Shit happens.

83
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,430
你迟到了
You're late!

84
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,180
时间刚刚好 老板
Just in time, boss.

85
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,620
他们闯进来 掐着我们的脖子…
They bust in here, step on our throats,

86
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,710
盗走了足以毁灭世界 的单一仪器
and take the one device that can cause a global power shift.

87
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:36,210
我们要如何取回来
So, how do we get it back?

88
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,050
那班混蛋轻而易举地 击败了我们的精英部队
These assholes just took out the best of the best like it was Sunday brunch.

89
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,560
我们需要一个与他们 势均力敌的间谍
We need someone who can move like them, fight like them.

90
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:47,810
这个人能够与龙卷风 正面交锋…
We need someone who can walk into a tornado,

91
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,230
并将其当作 万分温和的微风
and come out the other side like it was a damn gentle breeze.

92
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,320
你认识这般人物吗
You know someone like that?

93
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,480
不认识
No.

94
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,570
吉本斯却认识
But Gibbons did.

95
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,350
第一级战备等级

96
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,280
–你在做什么 –那太疯狂了
- What you doing? - ThaVs loco, chico!

97
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,770
桑德
Xander!

98
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,190
桑德
Xander!

99
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,880
嘿 朋友…
Hey friend...

100
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,880
等等我
give me a second.

101
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,780
球赛开始
And here we go, we are undeiway!

102
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,510
桑德 我就知道你能办到 你把世界带给了我们
Xander! I knew you would do it, Xander. You brought the world to us.

103
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,970
世界这么大
The world is big,

104
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,520
但你可以把它放在心中
but always fits in your heart.

105
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,940
你要永远放眼世界
Take it with you always

106
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,730
快去看球赛吧
Go, go, go.

107
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,940
桑德·凯奇大可以 像个普通人一样…
Of course, Xander Cage can't pay the satellite company,

108
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,110
付费给卫星公司
just like a regularguy.

109
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,780
什么
What?

110
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,660
让那些亿万富翁 更加有钱
And line the pockets of some boardroom billionaires?

111
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,290
你是知道的…
You know,

112
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,340
人一旦变得平凡 就不再特别了
these days, a regular guy can't afford to be regular.

113
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,630
我们走吧
Let's go.

114
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,720
第一守则 不要滑倒

115
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:20,180
多米尼加共和国 圣多明哥

116
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,740
这世界变小了
World getting smaller?

117
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,540
我知道这感受
I know the feeling.

118
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:45,920
逃避问题是解决不了 任何事的
Running from your problems never works out.

119
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,790
你需要一套新的计划
You need a new plan.

120
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,380
我需要的是一份新的地图
I need a new map.

121
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,050
别说我没警告你
Don't say I didn't warn you.

122
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,520
不是吧
Oh, boy.

123
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,440
又来了
Here we go again.

124
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,810
别动 混蛋
Down! Get down! Don't move, asshole!

125
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:54,030
快跪下 你这王八蛋
On your knees now, you son of a bitch!

126
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:57,530
我是真心想妥协的 但被你搞乱了
Okay, okay. I want to comply. I really wanna comply. But you're confusing me.

127
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:02,120
"别动 混蛋"以及"跪下 王八蛋" 我该服从哪一项
"Don't move, you asshole." "On your knees, you son of a bitch.!! Which is it?

128
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,540
–你只有三秒钟时间 –你的做法不太有效
- You have three seconds to comply! - You're not good at this.

129
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,830
一
One!

130
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
二
Two!

131
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,810
好了
Okay!

132
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,640
现身吧 科学怪人
Come on out, Frankenstein!

133
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:30,520
吉本斯
Gibbons! Gibbons?

134
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:33,150
数到三 你可以出来了
Oily-oily-oxen-free.

135
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:39,320
哇 你看起来大不相同 吉本斯
You really do look different, Gibbons.

136
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,320
你瘦了吗
Did you lose weight?

137
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:44,330
奥古斯对你的评语…
Augustus always had such, well,

138
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,540
一向来都不太乐观
not exactly nice things to say about you.

139
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,330
你是在何时发现 这一切都是虚构的
When did you realize it was all fake?

140
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,090
你指的是你策划的这场闹剧
You mean the clown show?

141
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,880
你安排埋伏的人 戴着一副昂贵的名牌耳机
You had a guy over there wearing$1 ,000 Beats

142
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,590
冒牌货只需一半的价格 就能到手了
when you can buy the knockoff for half the price.

143
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,090
那位女士赶着去搭的巴士 两小时后才开走
Or the lady that was running to catch a bus that doesn't leave for two hours.

144
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:05,760
还有用外币 购买汽水的保安
Or the security guard over there buying a soda with foreign currency?

145
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,890
你知道最大的败笔是什么
You know what the kicker was?

146
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,890
《世界多么美好》演员的客串
Clarence from It's a Wonderful Life.

147
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:13,690
那位你安排坐在我旁边 拿着一袋炸弹的老好人
The nice old man that you had sit down next to me with the bag of bombs?

148
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,570
他就那么恰巧知道我会说英文
Just happened to know I spoke English.

149
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,400
真是令人难以预料
Go figure.

150
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:22,110
–子弹有可能是真实的 –那么防弹衣也肯定得是真的
- The bullets could've been real. - Then the body armor would've been real.

151
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,620
我不清楚你的意愿… 但我不喜欢被人试探
I don't know you, but... I don't like to be tested.

152
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:31,040
吉本斯一直深信你还活着 他从未放弃找寻你的下落
Gibbons never believed you were dead! Never stopped looking for you.

153
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,960
–他真的把你当成挚友 –那他真是个傻瓜
- Hell of a friend. - Yeah, well, the joke's on him.

154
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,090
–因为我们从来都不是朋友 –相信我 他此刻没机会后悔
- Cause we were never friends. - Trust me, he's not laughing.

155
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,220
他永远也得不到任何机会了
Nor will he ever again, for that matter.

156
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,270
我从未见识过如此猖狂 的攻击手法
I've never seen anything like it.

157
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:53,230
这班人手法残暴 无法无天
This group is lethal, and they don't care who or what gets in their way.

158
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,570
我希望你会有兴趣 加入反击队伍
I was hoping you'd be interested in headlining the next fight card.

159
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:59,740
七十英尺的横跨距离 加上九十英尺的高度
Seventy feet across, 90 feet down.

160
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,990
三寸厚的防盗玻璃
Three inches of security glass?

161
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,990
没有使用任何绳索或降落伞
No rope. No line. No chute.

162
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,330
他们肯定很享受这个过程
I bet they had a blast.

163
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:12,290
我们比对全世界的数据库 却得不到任何脸部辨识结果
We ran facial IDs on every database in the world. Nothing.

164
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,790
连超速罚单纪录也没有
Not even a match on a speeding ticket.

165
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,290
他们像是不存在的幽灵 但在现今的数码世界里…
They're ghosts, in a day and age where

166
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,840
这绝对没有可能
that kind of thing is almost impossible.

167
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:21,800
好的…
Okay,

168
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,470
你知道我不会为政府机构做事
you get that I don't work for suits.

169
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,640
我又为何要扫这班人的兴
What makes you think I'm gonna want to ruin all their fun?

170
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,770
好吧…
Well,

171
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,600
你若不为了我…
if you won't do it for me,

172
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,020
就当是为了吉本斯
do it for Gibbons.

173
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:41,030
你的国家需要你 凯奇先生 极限特工需要你
Your country needs you, Mr. Cage. The Triple-X program needs you.

174
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,990
你是时候当个爱国者了
It's time to be a patriot.

175
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:46,450
按照谁的定义
By whose definition?

176
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,210
我上一次表现爱国时 被判三振出局
The last time I was patriotic, I got three strikes.

177
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,340
只有一个人愿意 相信失败者
And there was only one man who believed in the underdog.

178
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:03,510
爱国主义已灭亡了 现在只有反叛者和暴君
Patriotism is dead. There's only rebels and tyrants now.

179
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,340
那你属于哪一者
So, which are you?

180
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,520
我是极限特工
I'm Triple-X.

181
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,360
欢迎归队 极限特工
Well, welcome back, Triple-X.

182
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,910
你要去哪
Where are you going?

183
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,700
–伦敦 –为何 伦敦有什么
- London. - Why? What's in London?

184
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,040
幽灵猎手
A ghost hunter.

185
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,660
或许还有我的貂皮大衣
And possibly my fur coat.

186
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:19,250
我忘了这里的景色 是如此诱人
I'd forgotten how beautiful the view is up here.

187
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,630
看来你找回了大衣
I see you found your coat.

188
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,300
你答应过帮我保管
Well, you promised to take care of it for me.

189
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,970
我的确遵守了承诺
And I did.

190
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,050
我是来找人的
So, I'm looking for someone.

191
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,930
我们之间何时建立了 商业关系
Since when have we had a business relationship?

192
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:35,770
我若被查到碰触电脑 会被判刑二十年
I get caught even touching a computer, my ass goes away for 20.

193
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,230
开价吧
Name your price.

194
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,940
你知道我一向公平交易
You know I'm good for it.

195
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,940
这类的情报是无价的
Information like this doesn't have a price.

196
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,150
艾尹司莉 一切都有价格
Ainsley, everything has a price.

197
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,150
当然 你若没把握执行…
Now, if you don't think you can pull itoff,

198
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,320
或是身手大不如前 我能够理解
if you lost your edge, just tell me and I'll understand.

199
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:54,160
凯奇 你知道我为何犹豫
You wanna know what it is, Cage?

200
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,140
为什么
What?

201
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,250
我曾经认为你无人能比
I used to think you were the man.

202
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,830
但现在…
But now,

203
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,580
我发现你也不过如此
I don't know, maybe I feel like you're just working for him.

204
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,840
别这样
Come on.

205
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,010
没人知道我来了这里
Nobody knows I'm here.

206
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,840
你知道我能保守秘密
And you know how I am about keeping secrets.

207
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:12,970
无论你怎么说 国际刑警装置了新的监听器
So you say, but Interpol's got these new listening bugs.

208
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,020
他们化作隐形人 高超的科技不输英国军情六处
They're practically invisible. Real M16 kind of shit.

209
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:18,480
监听器可以融入肌肤 或辅佐在手臂下…
Disappear on your skin, under your arms,

210
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:21,100
甚至隐藏在私密处…
tied around your balls like a Christmas bow.

211
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,650
你大可以搜身
Unwrap me, then.

212
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,620
你知道吗 有研究证明性爱接触…
You know, studies have proven that sexual consummation irrevocably ruins

213
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:35,490
会彻底摧毁大多数关系
nine out of 10 relationships.

214
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:38,370
幸运的是 你喜欢接受挑战
Lucky for me, you love to gamble.

215
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,000
当然…
Of course...

216
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:43,500
不行
not.

217
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:47,840
但我的朋友们喜欢 孤注一掷
My friends, on the other hand, adore stiff odds.

218
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,010
孤注一掷
Stiff odds?

219
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:22,540
我为国家所作的奉献
The things I do for my country.

220
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:28,880
这像是大海捞针
Like finding needles in a stack of needles.

221
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:33,220
你虽然在英女皇的管制下 得套上脚踝监视器…
Even though you're shackled by the Queen,

222
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,550
本领依旧首屈一指
you're still the best in the world.

223
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,010
谢谢
Thank you.

224
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:40,560
帮自己一个忙 烧了这个
Do yourself a favor. Burn this.

225
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:44,230
我打听到你在找的这班幽灵 极具危害性
The whispers I hear, these ghosts of yours are the real kind of trouble.

226
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,900
他们受过专业训练 幕后也有雄厚的资金
They've got training, they've got funding,

227
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,110
会不惜任何代价 消除阻扰他们的人
and they've got no problem running over anyone who gets in their way.

228
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,860
你担心我会受伤
Okay, so, you're worried that I mightget hurt?

229
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,900
我担心你会死
I'm worried you might get dead.

230
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:58,410
你为我的安慰担忧 令我感动
You know, I'm touched that you can imagine a world without me in it.

231
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,460
这世界少了我 肯定少了欢乐
It'll be a little less fun.

232
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,090
我要说的只有这些
That's all I'm saying.

233
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:21,100
你要找的那班幽灵 此刻正在菲律宾
Your ghosts are hanging out in the Philippines.

234
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:23,730
我早该料到他们会 躲到太平洋地带
Figures they'd go to the Pacific.

235
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,270
一个没有网络连接的荒野
Some jungle rave that's off the grid.

236
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:29,730
你是如何在短时间内查出的
How the hell did you find it so quickly?

237
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,900
卧底
Undercover work.

238
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,980
你把潘多拉魔盒藏在哪里
Where is it? What did you do with Pandora's Box?

239
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,150
在一个很安全的地方
It's in a safe place.

240
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,450
这不是计划的一部分
That wasn't a part of the plan.

241
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:23,540
经过这么多年 你依然对我的临时变动感到惊讶
After all these years, you're still shocked when I improvise?

242
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:26,210
不是 我们的任务是销毁它
No. But the mission was to destroy it.

243
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,330
看来另有计划
Turns out there's a new mission.

244
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,130
我是不会销毁能够 让我们达到目的工具
I'm not gonna destroy the one thing I can use to get what we want.

245
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:35,300
–全世界都在通缉我们 –让他们来找吧
- The whole world is looking for us, Xiang. - Let them come!

246
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:38,340
你只在乎棋盘里的 典当牺牲
You worry about pawn sacrifice.

247
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:40,840
我却瞄准了国王
I got my eye on the king.

248
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,010
这就是问题所在
That's the problem.

249
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,020
你遗忘了皇后的存在
You forgot the queen.

250
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:58,200
英国 莱肯希思 皇家空军基地

251
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:03,370
你成功消灭无政府99恐怖组织之后 吉本斯收到了一张空白支票
After your success taking down Anarchy 99, Gibbons was handed a blank check.

252
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,870
换句话说…
Which is the long way of saying

253
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,040
他替你购买了崭新的 代步工具
he got you a new ride.

254
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:12,210
凯奇 在你的死讯传出后 这世界经历了重大的提升
World went and got an upgrade since you died, Cage.

255
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:15,710
板载无人机 防空对策…
Onboard drones, anti-air countermeasures,

256
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:19,930
以及巨大容量的燃油舱 足够环球航行三遍
and fuel tanks big enough to circumnavigate the globe three times

257
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,180
也无需降落
without ever landing.

258
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:29,560
你可以把大衣挂在衣帽间 我担保没人敢偷
You can check your coat. I promise you, no one would dare steal it.

259
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:32,060
我不能担保貂皮大衣 不会自行溜走
I can't guarantee it won't walk off on its own.

260
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:35,730
十分钟后起飞 你们已经落后七分钟了
Wheels up in 10, boys! Which means you're already seven minutes behind.

261
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:38,860
她一向来都如此有趣 或只限于特别日子
Is she always this much fun, or just on special occasions?

262
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:52,250
难怪我们的国家 会欠下万亿美元债务
No wonder our country's in debt trillions of dollars.

263
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,630
你们真需要这些高端科技 来抓坏人
Do you really need all these gadgets to get the bad guys?

264
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,590
我们什么都不需要
We don't need any of it.

265
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,880
但这让逮捕过程 有趣多了
But it makes the catching a hell of a lot more fun.

266
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,640
桑德·凯奇 我的天啊
Xander Cage. Holy shit!

267
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:11,440
仅有一夜的独家现身 这太疯狂了
Live and in concert, one night only. This is crazy!

268
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:15,110
我参加过一场科切拉音乐节 那是枪与玫瑰乐团的复出表演…
I was at Coachella and Guns N' Roses got back together,

269
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,270
但远比不上这个
but this is way cooler.

270
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:19,780
我其实并没有亲身 参与音乐会…
Well, I wasn't actually there, but I, like,

271
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,570
但我略有所闻 知道吗
heard about it, you know?

272
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,280
天啊 我还在喋喋不休
I'm still talking. Oh, my God.

273
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:27,120
抱歉 这是我的坏习惯 我一开始说话…
I'm sorry, it's like a bad habit. I get started and then...

274
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,450
–就停不下来 无法… –呼吸
- and then I can't... - Breathe.

275
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,500
慢慢来 若有必要 我懂得人工呼吸
Take your time. I know mouth-to-mouth if necessary.

276
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,010
哇 这些肌肉是怎么一回事
Are you kidding me with those guns?

277
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,090
你就像是真人版的终结者
You're like the frickin' Terminator!

278
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,930
我指的不是第一代的终结者
And I'm not talking about the first Terminator,

279
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:47,180
而是第二代 返回来杀死他的那个
but the second Terminator that goes back to kill the first Terminator.

280
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,680

283

我能想象你这样的男性 一定需要大量的援助
And I beta guy like you needs a lot of support.

284
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,860
你多重 220还是230磅
What are you? Like 220? 230?

285
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:01,360
老实回答 我的吊床只能承受250磅
Be honest. 250 is the hard max for my swing.

286
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:02,860
–别这样 –我闹着玩的
- Come on. - I'm kidding.

It's not like I have a safe word, or anything. It's "kumquat."

288
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:08,120
我从未想过那类形式
Never really think about it.

00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,660
我的字典里没有"安全"这个词语
No. "Safe" isn't in my vocabulary.

292
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,330

I can handle anything.

386
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,730
我的抓力也很紧实
And I've got a tight grip.

387
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:58,280
顺道一提 我不是外勤探员
And just so you know, I am not a field agent.

388
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:01,280
我从未出过任务
I do not go out in the field. Ever.

389
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,620
那里才有乐趣
Now, that's where all the fun is.

390
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,290
是的 但我害怕有趣的事物

也害怕坏人跟枪支
People scare me. Guns scare me.

392

尤其是持有枪支的坏人 我一受到惊吓就无法做事
People with guns really scare me. And if I'm scared, I can't do my job.

393
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:15,920
接着就会连带害死人 大家都死光了 我还能支援谁
And if I can't do my job, then people die. And if people die, then who am I tech-supporting?

394
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,460
没有人
Literally no one.

395
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,130
但我会尽全力保护你的安全
But I will make sure to keep you safe.

396
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,090
那并非易事
It ain't easy to keep me safe.

397
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,810
是的 我最爱坏男孩了

气动会活塞驱动齿轮 令拳头有四倍的速度和力道
Pneumatic pistons drive the gears, quadruple the speed and power of your punches.

400
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,650
不要
Nope, nope.

401
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:44,820
这是多级信号干扰器
This is a multistage signal disruptor.

402
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:46,330
非常易碎
It's very, very breakable.

403
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,750
你能告诉我 泛美航班103在洛克比…
Can you tell me the real reason behind the crash of

404
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,960
真正坠机的原因
Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie?

405
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,960
可以
Yes.

406
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,960
你和外星人是一伙的 对吗
You're one of them, aren't you?

407
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:59,100
当心 拳王洛基
Easy there, Rocky.

408
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:02,260
我说过这手套有着 强大的力道…
I wasn't kidding when I said there's enough force in these bad boys

409
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:05,640
足以打爆机身
to probably punch a hole through the fricking plane.

410
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,350
继续胡闹啊 还能出什么差错
Keep screwing around. What could possibly go wrong?

411
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:11,850
–那正是我的风格 –好的 那真是庆幸
- That is my style, though. - Yeah, good. Glad to hear it.

412
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:15,850
你知道吗 其实…
You know, actually,

413
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:18,980
你还是别碰的好…
I would rather if you didn't...

414
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,200
真是惊喜 你真的知道如何操作底部
That's refreshing. You actually know what you're doing down there.

415
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:25,160
没错 她也曾那样说过
Yeah. That's what she said.

416
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:32,370
菲律宾 卡拉摩安岛

417
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,140
有事吗
You need something, man?

418
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,310
我听说这地方 最适合让我的组员…
Well, I heard this is a perfect place to disappear for a few days

419
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,640
不被质问地 消失几天时间
for my crew, no questions asked.

420
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:37,480
只要价钱谈拢 我家就是你家
Mi casa es su casa, if the price is right.

421
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:38,900
好极了
Perfect. Tennyson!

422
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:39,900
泰尼森
Tennyson!

423
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:46,070
你肯定会喜欢 我有南太平洋最好的武器
You're gonna like this. I just happen to have the best hardware in the South Pacific.

424
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
拿百分之三十来交换 我们这里尚好的待客礼仪
30% off the top gets you our finest hospitality package.

425
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:01,840
三十 有包括周末陪伴的女郎 再附送两棵椰子吗
30% off the top? Do I get the girls for a weekend and two coconuts?

426
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,920
百分之十
10%.

427
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,670
百分之十
10%?

428
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:11,010
你一定是瞄准了其他 无法无天的偏僻岛屿
You musVve been aiming at the other lawless, uncharted island down the block. Happens all the time.

429
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:15,770
不如这样吧 你转过身上船 滚远点
Here's what you do. You turn around, go get your boat. You can kiss my ass.

430
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,690
好吧 等等
Okay, hang on.

431
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,270
你意下如何
What do you think?

432
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,940
是你说的
You talked me into it!

433
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,690
百分之十八
18%!

434
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:26,280
你把这当成了跳蚤市场
You think this is a flea market?

435
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:29,950
你以为我们在聚集区 售卖冒牌电视机和手表
You think we're in the hood selling TVs and fake watches, or something like that?

436
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,950
你搞什么
What's wrong with you, man?

437
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:37,450
好吧 二十二加半
All right. Twenty-two and a half.

438
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,120
你要如何计算"加半"
How you gonna do "and a half"?

439
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:44,670
二十二…
Twenty-two

440
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:47,300
加半
and a half.

441
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:58,310
好吧 尽情享受派对
All right. Enjoy this party.

442
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,980
我喜欢你的风格 兄弟
I like your style, man.

443
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:04,820
无论如何都在船上待着
Stay on that boat, no matter what.

444
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,570
阿黛尔 尼克斯
Adele, Nicks!

445
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:11,910
各位 小心藏好耳机
All right, guys, keep your earbuds in.

446
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,580
阿黛尔 一如往常 你当我天上的眼睛
Like always, Adele, you're my eyes in the sky.

447
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,250
尼克斯 你来炒热气氛
Nicks, you're gonna show'em how we do it.

448
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:43,440
你行吗
You got this?

449
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,940
等着看吧
Just watch.

450
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,710
你能帮我挂在吧台后面吗
Can you keep this behind the bar for me?

451
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:12,300
要喝什么
- What can I get you? - A cranberry and club soda.

452
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:14,640
蔓越莓汁加苏打
A cranberry club soda.

453
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,050
来两杯吧
Make that two.

454
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:26,980
–谢谢 –不客气
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

455
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:28,400
专注点
Stay focused.

456
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,570
不是吧
Really?

457
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,830
桑德·凯奇重出江湖
Xander Cage. Back in action.

458
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:42,000
我有离开过吗
Did I ever leave?

459
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,130
该死的
Shit.

460
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:00,760
发现小丑了
Spotted our clown.

461
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:05,940
比想象中简单 请大家喝一杯庆祝吧
Easier than expected. Drinks all around.

462
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:17,530
是他
That's him.

463
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:44,730
你知道什么 这是猎杀混蛋的季节
What do you know? It's douchebag hunting season.

464
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:46,140
我最喜欢的捕猎项目
My favorite.

465
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:48,810
现在还没到 要杀人的时候
It's a little early in the evening to slay someone.

466
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:51,150
让我来补救吧
- Let me fix it. - Come on.

467
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:55,820
若那般舞艺还不足以被射死 我真不知道谁该死
If Dance Dance Revolution doesn't deserve a bullet, I don't know who does.

468
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,490
这到底是派对还是葬礼
Is this a party or a funeral? It's a party!

469
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,000
无论是哪一个 今晚都会有着了火的身体
Either way, somebody's getting turnt up tonight!

470
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:28,230
我说过他擅长制造欢乐
I told you he was fun to have around.

471
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:56,880
我起初以为你是特种部队一员
At first, I thought Special Forces.

472
00:44:57,550 --> 00:44:59,380
但你却布满纹身
But your ink's all wrong.

473
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:01,390
美国中央情报局
CIA?

474
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,890
若是他们 早就派来无人机炸死我们了
They would send in a drone, bomb us to hell.

475
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:06,890
英国军情六处
M16?

476
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:10,060
你不属于他们喜欢的低调类型
You're not the kind of subtle they prefer.

477
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:16,230
来这岛屿的人 大多都是通缉犯
You know, the men who come to this island, they're on the run.

478
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,570
为了躲避这世界的追击
Hiding from the world.

479
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,740
但你不是
But not you.

480
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:23,240
你不是来逃难的
You're not here to hide.

481
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,660
你为了寻人
You're looking for someone.

482
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:32,420
谁说我还没找到她
And who's to say I haven't already found her?

483
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:39,170
你这番话是想吓唬我
Was that meant to scare me?

484
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,430
你若配上几分颤抖 会更逼真
A little tremble would be nice.

485
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:43,930
这个嘛…
Well,

486
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:47,850
看在你只差一步就得 坡脚离开这里…
considering you're one tremble away from limping out of here...

487
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:52,440
我胜券在握
? . .I'd say I'm close enough.

488
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:55,610
你的意思是 明早不会帮我做早餐
Does this mean you're not making me breakfast in the morning?

489
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:01,450
你还差几寸距离
I'd say you're a couple inches off.

490
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:09,040
碰上僵局了
Bit of a stalemate.

491
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:11,040
只要你放下枪
Not if you drop the gun.

492
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:13,290
我不是坏人
I'm not the bad guy.

493
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:17,040
我不相信好人
I don't believe in good guys.

494
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,840
赛琳娜
Serena?

495
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:24,050
他是谁
Who is he?

496
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:26,720
我们才刚认识
We just met.

497
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:30,560
但相处愉快 直到被某人…
But we were getting along famously until somebody

498
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,980
蓄意打断
decided to interrupt.

499
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:34,650
安分点
Stick to the path.

500
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,400
拿去吧 亲爱的
Here, honey.

501
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,650
这岛屿上有众多 无名牌的坟墓
There's a lot of unmarked graves on the island.

502
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:45,490
我敢说卖你那件上衣的人 就是其中一具死尸
Ill bet whoever sold you that shirt is in one of them.

503
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,990
你打算嚣张多久
And how long do you intend to push your luck?

504
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:51,500
直到我到达目的
Until I get what I came for.

505
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:54,370
你的目的是什么
Which is what exactly?

506
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,710
最烈的酒
A damn stiff drink.

507
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:26,610
我们坦诚相见吧
So, let's be real and talk about what we all really want.

508
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,870
我为了那东西而来
I'm only here for that.

509
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:40,710
你们大可完好的离去 除非你想延续我们之前的调情
And in my mind, you guys could walk away nicely. Unless you want to continue our foreplay.

510
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,050
这般威力不该 属于任何人
Power like that doesn't belong in anyone's hands.

511
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:47,720
我不过即兴发表
Just improvising.

512
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:59,730
不是吧 手榴弹 这里是九十初年代的东欧吗
Mate, seriously? A grenade? Mate, seriously? A grenade? What is this? Eastern Europe in 1990s?

513
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:01,230
他接着会给你发传真
Next, he's gonna send you a fax.

514
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:04,070
你为了独吞那东西…
So, you're willing to kill

515
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:06,900
愿意杀人
just to keep that for yourself?

516
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,910
你问错问题了
That's the wrong question to ask.

517
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,740
要如何问才是正确的
What's the right question?

518
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:15,750
"你愿意为此死吗 "
"Are you willing to die for it?"

519
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,090
一颗手榴弹 三个人
One grenade, three people.

520
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:25,840
我喜欢孤注一掷
I like the odds.

521
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:34,600
两颗手榴弹 三个人
Two grenades, three people.

522
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:37,520
我爱死了这场胜算
I'm loving these odds.

523
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:45,440
你有试过流了大量的血 眼前只有一片血染
You ever bleed so much, when you open your eyes, all you see is red?

524
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:48,450
当你在每个陆地上 都战斗过…
When you have fought war on every continent...

525
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:52,950
只要你一声口令 我就让这班混蛋上西天
Come on, X, just say the word. Let me put both these assholes out to pasture.

526
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,450
你等待的只有死亡
...you expect death.

527
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:56,540
人的身体是脆弱不堪的
Our bodies are such fragile things.

528
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:57,620
让我来射死他
Come on. Let me shoot him.

529
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,620
死亡有时候会…
Death sometimes just

530
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:02,170
出其不意的发生
sneaks up on you.

531
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:05,630
我很久没玩"烫手山芋" 这游戏了
It's been a while since I played hot potato.

532
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:08,510
我躺在医院的病床上…
I'm in this hospital bed.

533
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:12,510
神志不清 出现幻觉 四周都是自己流的血
I'm barely conscious. Delirious. Drowning in my own blood.

534
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:16,310
我脑海里只听到 "就是今天了"
And all I can hear myself think is, !!Today!s the day.!!

535
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:18,140
"今天是你死亡的日子"
!!Today!s the day you die.!!

536
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:20,980
我很有感触
I'm touched.

537
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:22,900
我能要回大衣吗
Can I have my jacket, when you get a sec?

538
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,190
接着走来了一个男人…
Then a man comes along, tells me a story

539
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:28,490
告诉我一个关于加州干旱的故事…
about a drought in California.

540
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:31,490
其中还有滑板和泳池
About skateboards and swimming pools.

541
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:35,200
以及一个名为桑德·凯奇的男人
About a man named Xander Cage.

542
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:38,040
该死的 他是极限特工
Shit. He's Triple-X.

543
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:43,880
我听闻他死掉了
I heard he was dead.

544
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:48,550
是真的吗
Is he?

545
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:53,220
我们都是极限特工
We are all Triple-X.

546
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:56,180
只不过有不同的议程
We just have different agendas.

547
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:58,560
她想要销毁这东西
She wants to destroy it.

548
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:01,020
我想要加以利用
I'm gonna use it.

549
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:06,190
你若把这带回国家安全局 我们就玩完了
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna let you take it back to the NSA.

550
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:14,030
机密

551
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,090
派对现在开始
Now, it's a party.

552
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:50,070
老实点 老实点
Everybody, get down! Move! Move!

553
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,400
要出大事了
Shit's about to go down.

554
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:54,240
准备好狂欢了
You ready to have some fun?

555
00:50:55,410 --> 00:50:57,410
把音乐关掉
Turn off the music!

556
00:50:57,570 --> 00:50:58,660
停止
Stop it!

557
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:09,800
大家把手举起来
Everybody, hands up!

558
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:10,960
现在
Now!

559
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:13,510
趴下
On the floor!

560
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:17,850
第一个移动的人就得死
First person to move, first person to die!

561
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:25,810
我移动了
I moved.

562
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:33,280
我又移动了
I just moved again. I'm still alive.

563
00:51:33,610 --> 00:51:34,840
我还活着
I am still alive.

564
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:36,990
闭嘴吧"英雄 "
Shut up, "hero"!

565
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:39,280
好的
All right.

566
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:41,330
来吧
Let's do this.

567
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:42,660
别动
Don't move!

568
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:48,670
我手上有你要的东西
Okay, I actually have what you want.

569
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
潘多拉魔盒
Pandora's Box?

570
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:53,340
就在这里
I got it right here.

571
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:55,340
但你错了
But you're wrong, though.

572
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:59,010
你若从我这里拿走 就等着死吧
You take it from me, and you die first.

573
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:02,350
接着死的会是自以为能保卫你的 列宁格勒中尉
Then Lieutenant Leningrad, who thinks he's got your back.

574
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:04,640
再来就是看守门口 叫做埃文的两位士兵
Then the two Ivans by the door.

575
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:07,520
吧台的莫斯科骡子
Moscow Mule by the bar.

576
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:11,520
最后是楼梯旁的伊戈尔
And then Igor on the stairs.

577
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:14,030
你听清楚接下来会发生的事了
See where we're going with this?

578
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:17,530
但全都无所谓
But none of that matters.

579
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:20,530
因为我说过了…
Cause like I said,

580
00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:25,330
你若从我这里拿走… 就等着死吧
if you take this from me, you die first.

581
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:28,330
我不管你是生或死 都会把那东西抢走
Ill take it from you dead or alive.

582
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:34,710
你若是抓得太紧 我就切下你的手臂
And if you hold it too tight, I cut your arm off.

583
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:36,720
随你便吧
Suit yourself.

584
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:46,730
列宁格勒
Leningrad.

585
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:48,350
嗨 埃文
Hi, Ivan.

586
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:49,730
另一名埃文
Other Ivan.

587
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:01,200
再见了 莫斯科骡子
Bye-bye, Moscow Mule.

588
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:08,710
伊戈尔 你又欠我人情了 桑德
Igor. That's another one you owe me, X.

589
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:11,040
注意两指之间
Read between the lines.

590
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:30,560
泰尼森 你应该来支援我们的
Tennyson! Some back-up would be nice.

591
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:33,770
来支援我们 快啊
Some back-up would be nice! Come on, man!

592
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:35,730
桑德说过我得在船上待着
X said stay on the boat.

593
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:42,160
那是俄罗斯人入侵之前的事
That was before the goddamn Russian invasion touched down, man!

594
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:19,840
桑德说过我得在船上待着
X said stay on the boat.

595
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:37,610
你要加入游戏吗
You want to play?

596
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:21,540
这东西不属于任何人
That doesn't belong in anyone's hands.

597
00:57:22,290 --> 00:57:25,300
想要的话…就来抢走
You want it, come and get it.

598
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:30,930
有必要这样做吗
Was that necessary?

599
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:33,470
这会是吉本斯的意愿
It's what Gibbons would have wanted.

600
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:39,940
桑德
X!

601
00:57:42,770 --> 00:57:43,480
桑德
x.

602
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:46,480
又发生了 另一颗卫星跌落了
It happened again. Another satellite fell.

603
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:51,910
我们应该携手合作
Us working as a team.

604
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:55,410
这才是吉本斯的意愿
That's what Gibbons would've wanted.

605
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:59,080
你要加入吗
You in?

606
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:03,960
莫斯科奥林匹克体育场 发生爆炸事件
An explosion inside the Olympic Stadium rocks Moscow.

607
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:04,040
现场连线 卫星击中俄罗斯体育场

608
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:06,000
有七名员工已被证实死亡…
Seven workers are now confirmed dead,

609
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:10,170
这起毫无意义的暴力 也造成至少25位伤者
with at least 25 others injured in this senseless act of violence.

610
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:12,470
来自五角大楼的消息指出…
A source inside the Pentagon

611
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:16,930
一颗离群的卫星 已被用作武器
says a rogue satellite may have been used as a weapon.

612
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:20,850
看来潘多拉魔盒 并非机密档案
Guess this means Pandora's Box isn't exactly classified.

613
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:24,650
在刚发布的新视频中 一组匿名团体…
In a new video released just moments ago, an anonymous group

614
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:28,700
声称自己有能力把 卫星用作武器 他们道出…
is claiming to have the ability to use satellites as weapons.

615
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:33,490
"侵犯全世界市民的公民权利…"
They claim "that the violation of civil liberties "of all the citizens of the world

616
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:35,990
"是一项必须被阻止的暴行"
"is an atrocity that must be stopped."

617
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:41,460
在接下来的24小时内 禁止并拆除全世界的间谍程序…
Disable and dismantle all the world's spy programs within the next 24 hours,

618
00:58:41,870 --> 00:58:44,710
否则我就亲自动手 一次引爆一颗卫星
or I will do it for you one satellite at a time.

619
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:47,840
地球此刻被 三万颗卫星环绕着
There are 30,000 satellites orbiting the Earth at this moment.

620
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:52,840
我会每24小时落下一颗卫星 直到我的要求被达成
I will drop one satellite eveiy 24 hours until my demands are met.

621
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:54,550
在莫斯科的目击证人…
Eyewitnesses in Moscow...

622
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,470
–这也是你计划的一部分 –当然不是
- Was this always part of your mission, too? - Of course not.

623
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:01,890
我们是吉本斯新打造的 极限特工
We were a new Triple-X team Gibbons created.

624
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:06,520
我们查出一名高级智能官员 正试图操纵卫星
We discovered a high-level intelligence officer was trying to manipulate satellites.

625
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:09,190
但还来不及 掀开他的真面目…
And even before we could unmask him,

626
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:11,190
吉本斯就遭到毒手了
Gibbons was killed.

627
00:59:11,530 --> 00:59:13,530
原来你一早就知道 他们是极限特工
So, you knew they were Triple-X all along.

628
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:16,030
我需要你对这次行动 保留该有的客观感
I needed you to retain a sense of objectivity.

629
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:20,370
我不明白 潘多拉魔盒已被我销毁 为何会出现在莫斯科
I don't understand. If I destroyed Pandora's Box, what happened in Moscow?

630
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:22,540
我若没猜错的话…
If I'm right, which I am,

631
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:26,210
潘多拉魔盒只能 操控一颗卫星…
this box only ever had the ability to control one satellite.

632
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:27,710
那是什么意思
What does that mean?

633
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:30,380
我们追击的 不过是一个样板
It means we've been chasing a prototype.

634
00:59:30,590 --> 00:59:33,340
–真实的却落入了这班人手中 –没错
- And these guys have the real one? - Yeah.

635
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:44,850
我们被赛琳娜耍了
Serena played us for fools.

636
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:47,440
她背叛了我们
Betrayed us.

637
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:51,360
这不关系到赛琳娜 这是一场战争…
This isn't about Serena. This is war. And either

638
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:54,170
我们今天要是不制止他 明天世界就会被毁灭
we stop it today, or we watch the world burn tomorrow.

639
00:59:54,330 --> 00:59:56,350
- 我们得以大事为重 - 对
- Can't lose focus on that. - Yeah.

640
00:59:57,950 --> 01:00:01,040
你到哪去了 去寻欢作乐
Where you been? You stop off for the old rub-and-tug?

641
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,950
你母亲问候你
Your mom says hi.

642
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:05,540
你放置了追踪器 没被人发现
Tracker on board? Nobody saw you?

643
01:00:05,790 --> 01:00:07,790
–我一直都来去无踪 –很好
- Nobody ever sees me, boss. - Good.

644
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:12,210
这些官员操控着 所有在空中的卫星
Now, these suits control every spy satellite in the sky.

645
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:16,720
但这七员有多常机会 同时聚集在一个房间内
But how often do these seven men all sit in the same room together?

646
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:18,470
几乎没有过
Almost never.

647
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,640
若需要视网膜扫描…
And if you needed retinal scans,

648
01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:26,640
全世界握拳人士的 手机数据转储 生物识别…
cell phone data dumps, biometrics of all the superpowers in the world,

649
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:29,400
你会锁定谁
who would you target?

650
01:00:29,650 --> 01:00:30,480
该死的
Shit.

651
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:34,320
有谁握有聚集 那类资讯的权利
Who has that kind of power to actually set that in motion?

652
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:39,320
你怀疑错人了 是我来找你的 记得吗
You're pissing up the wrong tree, Cage. I came looking for you, remember?

653
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:42,240
嘿 混蛋 我们惹麻烦了
Yo, asshole. We gonna have problems?

654
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:45,160
没事 你的旅程还好吗
No problem. How was your trip?

655
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:47,920
我不过是做做算术罢了
I'm just doing the math.

656
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:50,250
是吗 何种算术
Yeah? What math?

657
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:53,670
空气速度除以距离
Air velocity divided by distance.

658
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:58,010
所以当我把你塞入马桶时 搜寻队伍会知道…
So, when I stuff you down the toilet, search and rescue will know where

659
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:00,340
得在中国和北韩之间 找到你
to find you between China and North Korea.

660
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:02,100
继续胡扯吧 小人物
Keep talking shit, little man.

661
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:04,430
切记你说的话 特种部队士兵
Hold that thought, G.l. Joe.

662
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:08,100
倒转
Roll it back.

663
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:10,520
多一些
A little more.

664
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:11,690
再多一些
More.

665
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:15,280
停止
A little more. Stop.

666
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:18,200
当翔撞破玻璃时…
Okay, when Xiang broke the window,

667
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:25,450
只有他临危不乱
he's the only one that didn't flinch.

668
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:27,960
替我接通总统
I need the President on the phone...

669
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:31,960
你知道那是清除不了的吗 我得把整个银幕换掉
That's not gonna come off, you know that, right? I'll have to replace the goddamn screen.

670
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:35,630
我早说过了 中央情报局局长想要毁灭世界
I've been saying the director of the CIA has been trying to destroy the world for years.

671
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:39,470
我们被全权委任 拘捕这个混蛋
Okay, we have carte blanche to track this son of a bitch down.

672
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:42,220
你们有谁知道该如何着手
Do any of you know how to do it?

673
01:01:42,550 --> 01:01:45,140
用回我和翔在纽约找出 潘多拉盒子的方法
The same way Xiang and I found Pandora's Box in New York.

674
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:51,980
由于卫星不间断的旋转 潘多拉盒子必须重复连接信号
Pandora's Box needs to keep reconnecting itself because the satellites orbit.

675
01:01:52,150 --> 01:01:53,400
请让一让
Excuse me.

676
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:56,650
我们只需查出 主要信号的来源…
All we need to do is track down the main signal,

677
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:59,900
就能锁定它在 20英里半径距离内的位置
and then we can approximate its location within a 20-mile radius.

678
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:00,990
密歇根州

679
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:04,410
底特律

680
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,580
在众多可以隐藏的地方…
Of all the places in the world to lay low,

681
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
这疯子竟然选择了底特律
this fruit loop chooses Detroit?

682
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:13,750
密歇根州 底特律

683
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:21,930
爆炸事件虽然发生在莫斯科 世界各地却感受到了余震
These blasts did take place in Moscow, but they were felt around the world.

684
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:26,350
莫斯科这场悲剧的 死亡人数持续增加
Good morning. As feared, the death toll in the Moscow tragedy is rising.

685
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:28,020
死伤之余…
In addition to the latest deaths..

686
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:32,850
让我猜想看 世界各国都趁机拆卸间谍程序
Let me guess. Everyone's jumping at the chance to dismantle their spy programs.

687
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:34,860
不是
No.

688
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:39,360
全世界没那么聪明 能看穿莫斯科事件是真实的
The world's too stupid to realize that Moscow wasn't a bluff.

689
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:46,120
极限特工 你们的基地将设在 国家安全局的安全屋
Okay, Triple-X, you will base out of an NSA safe house.

690
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:51,120
贝姬会通过耳机操控支援 并使信号中断器处于待机状态
Becky will coordinate earbud communications and have the signal disruptor on standby.

691
01:02:51,290 --> 01:02:54,710
当我为了救你一命 而把船撞击上岸…
Nicks, when I crashed the boat up on shore and saved your life...

692
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:56,380
随你便 兄弟
Yeah, whatever, bro.

693
01:02:56,630 --> 01:03:01,550
你说那次能正式算是 第199的车祸吗
.do you think that counts as crash 199 for me? You know, officially?

694
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:03,800
正式而言 你是个疯子
Officially, you're deranged.

695
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:07,550
好极了
Cool.

696
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:11,140
我们将设置一个三角形 的信号跟踪系统
We'll set up a triangulated signal tracking system around the city.

697
01:03:11,310 --> 01:03:14,900
贝姬一旦锁定他的正确位置 我们就开始行动
And when Becky locks in his exact location, we make our move.

698
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:18,400
那你呢 你是如何参与的
What about you? How did you get roped into all this?

699
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:22,070
我在摩天大楼上涂鸦 被判服刑一年监狱
I tagged a skyscraper and got a year in jail for it.

700
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,650
监狱
Jail?

701
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:26,820
太极端了
Seems excessive.

702
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:29,490
那涂鸦长达三十楼层高
The tag was 30 stories tall.

703
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,910
在网上的视频点阅率高达两百万
Two million hits on YouTube.

704
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,250
我也只服刑了一半时间
And I served only half the sentence.

705
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:37,540
让我猜想 吉本斯来拯救了你
Let me guess. Gibbons to the rescue.

706
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:40,920
他说像我这般野心 不适合被关在任何笼子里
Yup. He said a lion like me doesn't belong in any kind of cage.

707
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:52,350
我在离开国家安全局后纹上的
I got mine after I left the NSA.

708
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:55,440
–你手腕上的呢 –在伦敦
- What about that one on your wrist? - London.

709
01:03:55,770 --> 01:03:58,940
2009年 我成功登上千禧之轮
2009. I climbed the Millennium Wheel.

710
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:00,770
光着身子
Naked.

711
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:02,440
–光着 –没错
- Naked? - Yeah.

712
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:04,450
高中
High school.

713
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:07,870
不
No!

714
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:11,040
我们都有过不堪回首的往事
We all have our embarrassing moments.

715
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:16,290
那个性感的呢
What about that sexy one?

716
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:19,420
这个 浴火凤凰
This? Phoenix out of the ashes.

717
01:04:19,790 --> 01:04:21,800
我在墨西哥的一张椅子上 花了十八小时完成
Eighteen hours in a chair in Mexico.

718
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:24,210
我灌下了和我体重相等 的龙舌兰酒才能撑下去
I drank my bodyweight in tequila to get through it.

719
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,720
这也是最具意义的
It's the most important one, actually.

720
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:32,470
我是在那时候 决定要与世界为伍…
It's when I decided to change the world instead of

721
01:04:32,970 --> 01:04:34,350
而非对抗一切
rage against it.

722
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:41,900
我们找到他了 也查出潘多拉盒子的位置
We found him. We found Pandora's Box.

723
01:04:43,030 --> 01:04:44,690
桑德 有收到吗
Xander, do you copy?

724
01:04:45,190 --> 01:04:48,030
收到 派上泰尼森
We're here. Okay, send Tennyson.

725
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:52,030
404号东国会街 他在顶楼
Looks like East 404 Congress Street. He's on the top floor.

726
01:04:59,330 --> 01:05:00,420
选择卫星

727
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:05,010
我接收到潘多拉盒子有动静…
I'm showing activity in Pandora's Box. I can jam the signal,

728
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:08,430
我只能暂时制止信号几分钟时间 你们动作要快
but only for a few minutes, so hurry.

729
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,930
你们得赶紧抵达 将他压制
You've got to get there fast and take this guy down.

730
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:20,350
我们得先找到他
Not if we find him first.

731
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,860
红灯 红灯
Red light! Red light! Red light!

732
01:05:33,870 --> 01:05:38,040
交通信号是石油机构发明来 浪费燃料和增加利润的伎俩
Did you know traffic signals were invented by Big Oil

733
01:05:38,210 --> 01:05:41,130
我如果附和你 你能开慢点吗 小心
If I say yes, will you please just slow down? Look out!

734
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:44,630
等等
Wait.

735
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:49,550
你是否得在这一刻 担任婊子角色来警告我
Is this the part where you act the basic bitch and tell me you got your eye on me and that you don't trust me?

736
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:51,390
解答正确
Welcome to the moment.

737
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:06,780
每个人都需要后备
Everyone needs backup.

738
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,410
停停 停车
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

739
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:12,780
停停 停车
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

740
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:19,250
泰尼森
Tennyson?

741
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:23,000
交通大堵塞
Gridlocked.

742
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,420
在这里
There it is.

743
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:28,340
你若遇上麻烦…
If you run into trouble,

744
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:30,170
拨打9号
dial nine.

745
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:32,430
这是吉本斯老旧的紧急后备措施
It's an old Gibbons fail-safe.

746
01:06:47,610 --> 01:06:50,440
你打乱了我的计划 也偷走了我的拍档
You crashed my party! Stole my dance partner.

747
01:06:51,450 --> 01:06:52,780
我也来捣乱你
I'm gonna crash yours.

748
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:53,990
玩的开心
Have fun.

749
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:56,780
这不是派对 这是一场竞赛
This ain't a party. This is a race.

750
01:07:10,630 --> 01:07:12,970
–你在做什么 –搭建一个坡道
What the hell you think you're doing? Building a ramp.

751
01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:25,560
快去
Go, go, go!

752
01:08:06,230 --> 01:08:08,270
- 给我下车 下来 - 你要干什么
- Hey! Out of the car! Get out! - What are you doing?

753
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:09,440
快下车
Let's go!

754
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:14,460
该死的 他尝试重新连接
Shit. He's trying to reconnect it.

755
01:09:14,670 --> 01:09:17,950
我只能在他选择另一颗卫星前 短暂地阻塞信号
Guys, I can only jam the signal for so long before he chooses another satellite.

756
01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:18,870
你们得赶紧
You have to hurry.

757
01:09:20,470 --> 01:09:22,140
我有一个计划
I have a plan.

758
01:09:23,810 --> 01:09:25,140
等等
Hold on!

759
01:09:25,310 --> 01:09:27,020
"等等"才不是什么计划
"Hold on" ain't no goddamn plan!

760
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:32,550
不 不 不
No, no, no, no!

761
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:51,170
你在找人吗
You looking for someone?

762
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,890
第两百次的撞击
That's 200!

763
01:10:04,470 --> 01:10:06,390
第200次车祸 来自底特律的问候

764
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:23,740
来啊
Come on.

765
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:31,280
不 不 不
No, no, no...

766
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:33,380
桑德 你必须到达顶楼 他正在启动另一颗卫星
Xander, you gotto getto the top floor. He's trying to engage another satellite.

767
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:34,540
动作快
Huriy.

768
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:50,390
小事一桩
Fish in a barrel.

769
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:05,620
四十五口径 德国自动装填手枪
Forty-five U.S.P.

770
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:07,620
十二颗圆形弹匣
Twelve round mag.

771
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,540
仅剩五颗子弹
Five left.

772
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:17,460
三颗
Three.

773
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:34,810
发生了什么事
What the hell's going on out there?

774
01:11:46,990 --> 01:11:47,830
没子弹了
Empty.

775
01:12:11,850 --> 01:12:14,980
阿黛尔 桑德进屋了 找出目标位置并射击
Adele, Xander's in. Find the target, light him up.

776
01:12:19,110 --> 01:12:20,820
吉本斯深信你一定会返回
Gibbons thought you'd be back.

777
01:12:21,860 --> 01:12:23,860
来当我们需要的英雄角色
To be the hero we needed.

778
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:30,370
你若是把盒子还给 国家安全局…
You take the box to the NSA,

779
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:32,700
我们就功亏一篑了
and we're right back to where we started.

780
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:41,210
这真是令人感伤
This is touching.

781
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:46,300
吉本斯看到你们两人 携手合作一定会倍感欣慰
Gibbons would be proud to see you two working together.

782
01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:55,810
我不会有事的 桑德
I'm walking out of here, Xander.

783
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,060
你要知道一个秘密吗
You want to know a secret?

784
01:13:00,730 --> 01:13:02,570
你忘了涂抹体香剂
You forgot to put deodorant on?

785
01:13:04,070 --> 01:13:08,070
吉本斯是我杀的 他是个自以为正义的白痴
I killed Gibbons because he was a self-righteous prick.

786
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:08,970
能瞄准吗
Do you have a shot?

787
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:10,790
他还以为自己是正义的化身
He thought he had the right to police the world.

788
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:12,910
阿黛尔 瞄准目标了吗
Adele, do you have eyes on the target?

789
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:14,330
我转换至热瞄准范围
I'm switching to thermal.

790
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:17,750
我无论如何 都不会停止引爆卫星…
I was never going to stop downing satellites

791
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:22,920
你知道为何 因为这世界全是一派胡言
no matter what happened. You know why? Because this world has turned...

792
01:13:23,090 --> 01:13:25,340
拜托告诉我你找到射击点了
Please, please, please tell me you have a shot.

793
01:13:25,550 --> 01:13:26,380
该死的
Damn it.

794
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:29,050
他提升了屋内的温度 我什么也看不到
He's turned the heat up. I can't see shit.

795
01:13:29,260 --> 01:13:31,600
桑德 我看不见你们的位置 热瞄准范围不管用
X can't see you guys. Thermal's no good.

796
01:13:31,850 --> 01:13:33,720
–是吗 –你的温度太高 我看不见你
- Right? - I've lost you in the heat.

797
01:13:33,890 --> 01:13:35,440
你看不到世界的变化吗
You don't see what's going on in this world?

798
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:36,460
别激动
Take it easy.

799
01:13:38,890 --> 01:13:40,940
–你打算怎么做 –冷静
- So, what are you gonna do about it? - Easy.

800
01:13:41,110 --> 01:13:45,070
桑德 继续让他说话 我还没找到射击点
X, keep Chatty Cathy talking. I still don't have a shot.

801
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:49,280
一切都是我们造成的 是吉本斯和你们还有我
We made it that way. People like Gibbons and the two of you. And me.

802
01:13:49,450 --> 01:13:51,570
是我们搞砸的
We made it that way. I mean, come on.

803
01:13:51,910 --> 01:13:55,620
这世界若不被重整 每天活着有什么意义
What's the point of getting up in the morning if you're not gonna reboot the world, right?

804
01:13:55,790 --> 01:13:56,910
冷静下来
Okay. Easy.

805
01:13:57,080 --> 01:14:00,420
外头发生战争了 我们为了生存的战斗
There's a war out there. We're at war for our survival, you don't see it?

806
01:14:00,620 --> 01:14:02,790
成千上万的人死得毫无价值
Millions of people have died for nothing... It's their right.

807
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:05,590
看样子你又得欠我一命了
Read between the lines.

808
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:08,090
–我说对了吗 –我对你老实说吧
- Isn't it right? - I'm gonna be honest with you.

809
01:14:08,420 --> 01:14:10,430
一直让我心烦的事…
What's been bugging me this whole time

810
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:15,260
你牙缝中 夹了一些食物
is you've got something stuck in between your teeth.

811
01:14:15,430 --> 01:14:17,980
–你在胡说什么 –我是认真的
- What the hell are you talking about? - I'm serious.

812
01:14:18,270 --> 01:14:19,480
你怎么了
What the hell's wrong with you?

813
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:21,980
就在…这个位置
Right there.

814
01:14:28,740 --> 01:14:29,740
完美的射击
Nice shot.

815
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:31,240
你有迟疑过吗
Was there ever a doubt?

816
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:34,330
是的 我承认我有
Yeah, I confess, I had my doubts.

817
01:14:36,910 --> 01:14:39,830
这就是抹黑我朋友吉本斯的下场
That's for talking shit about my friend, Gibbons.

818
01:14:51,090 --> 01:14:54,180
翔 跪下
Xiang! Get on your knees! On your knees!

819
01:14:55,510 --> 01:14:57,510
手举起来
Hands! Hands!

820
01:14:58,140 --> 01:14:59,480
快跪下
On your knees, now.

821
01:15:01,770 --> 01:15:03,440
赶上了
Just in time.

822
01:15:05,610 --> 01:15:10,110
当心点 凯奇 你再继续这样会被误认为好人
Watch out, Cage. Keep this up, people might mistake you for one of the good guys.

823
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,870
嘿 政府官员
Hey, suit.

824
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:21,040
你达到目的了
You got what you wanted.

825
01:15:21,870 --> 01:15:23,540
我们都知道他不是坏人
We both know he's not the bad guy.

826
01:15:23,710 --> 01:15:25,460
那莫斯科一事该怪罪于谁
And who do we blame for Moscow?

827
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:29,550
活生生的恐怖分子 总好过一个死掉的政府官员
Better a living terrorist than a dead company man.

828
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,380
你明白我说什么了
You see what I'm saying?

829
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:34,970
回到机上 二十分钟后起飞
Let's go. Back on the plane. lwantwheels up in 20.

830
01:15:35,140 --> 01:15:36,140
走吧
Let's go, boys.

831
01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:44,400
我们夺回了潘多拉魔盒
We recovered Pandora's Box.

832
01:15:44,730 --> 01:15:47,360
他们会派来一组押解小队 来接送你们
They're gonna send an extraction team to pick you guys up.

833
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:49,190
但是翔被他们逮捕了
But they're taking Xiang.

834
01:15:50,190 --> 01:15:51,900
赛琳娜…
And, Serena,

835
01:15:52,070 --> 01:15:54,910
若收不到我的答复 切记 拨打9号
if you don't hear from me, remember, dial nine.

836
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:57,240
极限特工不会丢下彼此
Xtakes care of its own.

837
01:15:57,410 --> 01:15:59,580
你把盒子还给玛克了 对吗
You gave it back to Marke, didn't you?

838
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:12,920
这地方真不错 宽敞又昂贵
Nice place. Spacious. Expensive.

839
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:14,380
闭嘴
Shut up.

840
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:24,940
谢谢你 长官
Thank you, sir.

841
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:28,440
是的 少量的死伤人数…
Yes, minimal casualties. Triple-X performed

842
01:16:28,730 --> 01:16:31,440
极限特工的表现 超越了合理的范围
beyond any reasonable measure of expectation.

843
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,790
让我猜想
Let me guess.

844
01:16:48,290 --> 01:16:50,460
那通电话是要 邀约我到总统府
That was my invite to the Oval Office.

845
01:16:55,130 --> 01:16:58,640
在十分钟前 极限特工计划正式被瓦解了
As of 10 minutes ago, the Triple-X program was officially shuttered.

846
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:03,430
所有特工将从记录档案中删除 并轨列为国家的敌人
All active agents are to be erased from record and considered enemies of the state.

847
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:08,480
拿枪对准我 从来都不是好办法
It's just never a good idea to point a gun at me.

848
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:17,150
国家安全局的押解小队 通常都全副武装吗
Hey, are NSA extraction teams normally armed like they're invading Fallujah?

849
01:17:17,490 --> 01:17:19,780
通常不会 看守好这些男孩
No, generally not. Watch the boys.

850
01:17:22,950 --> 01:17:23,700
该死的
Shit.

851
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:26,520
噢 天哪 有麻烦了是不是
God, it's happening, isn't it?

852
01:17:26,670 --> 01:17:28,470
他们即将展开枪战 对吗
They're gonna start shooting at us, aren't they?

853
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:30,170
–动作快 –快走
- Come on! - Clear out, let's go!

854
01:17:31,630 --> 01:17:32,500
是时候上场了
It's showtime.

855
01:17:32,670 --> 01:17:34,340
我们现在同属一队了
I guess we're on the same team now.

856
01:17:34,510 --> 01:17:35,840
给我一支枪
Give me one.

857
01:17:37,630 --> 01:17:41,510
你知道我的风格 只要把我瞄准对的方向就行了
You know me. Wind me up, point me in the right direction.

858
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:43,310
大家走吧
Come on, let's go!

859
01:17:43,510 --> 01:17:47,180
情况变得严重了 是该这个样子吗
This shit is getting real, isn't it? Is this what happens when shit gets real?

860
01:17:47,230 --> 01:17:48,520
我们该怎么做
What do we do?

861
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:50,810
躲开子弹
Just be where the bullets aren't.

862
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:54,530
很遗憾的 恐怖份子再度启动潘多拉盒子…
Sadly, the terrorist activated Pandora's Box

863
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:57,360
但我们无法阻止他
one last time before we could stop him.

864
01:17:57,700 --> 01:18:02,320
你和整个团队在仪器爆炸时 全军覆没
You and your entire team were lost in the blast along with the device itself.

865
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:06,160
这世界若是认为 潘多拉魔盒被毁灭了…
If the world thinks Pandora's Box is gone,

866
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:09,210
就无法得知 我们正用来监督他们
then they won't know we're using it to spy on them.

867
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:11,210
你不过是另一个暴君
You're just another tyrant.

868
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:13,380
不 是爱国者
No. Patriot.

869
01:18:13,670 --> 01:18:15,710
让我来教育你这其中的分别
Let me educate you on the difference.

870
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:17,210
桑德
Xander!

871
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:21,010
桑德
Xander!

872
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:28,700
听说死亡是最终的历险记 凯奇
They say it's the last great adventure, Cage.

873
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,150
记得给我们寄明信片
Be sure and send a postcard.

874
01:18:30,390 --> 01:18:32,060
–发动引擎 –出发
- Engines hot! - Let's go!

875
01:18:32,230 --> 01:18:33,060
桑德
Xander!

876
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:35,230
桑德·凯奇
Xander Cage!

877
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:40,900
–快走 –分散
- Go, go! - Everybody, fan out!

878
01:18:41,070 --> 01:18:43,070
找掩护 快
Find cover! Move!

879
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:44,450
过去那里
Get behind there!

880
01:18:46,370 --> 01:18:47,910
快找掩护
- There, take cover! Okay, okay. - Get behind there!

881
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:08,930
真刺激
What a rush.

882
01:19:10,060 --> 01:19:12,730
该死的 贝姬 这防弹背心真了得
Damn, Becky, that's some body armor.

883
01:19:17,730 --> 01:19:21,110
嘿 都说了你这人没礼貌
Hey. I told you you got no manners.

884
01:19:22,450 --> 01:19:25,070
你母亲没教会你 要拉好拉链吗
Did your mother ever teach you howto zip up your pants?

885
01:19:33,290 --> 01:19:34,330
怎样
Well?

886
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:45,300
赛琳娜
Serena.

887
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:47,350
我们现在正忙着
We're a bit busy now!

888
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:51,600
玛克掌握了潘多拉魔盒 她即将在你们上方引爆卫星
Marke's got Pandora's Box. She's gonna drop a satellite on top of you.

889
01:19:52,810 --> 01:19:55,270
她即将对我们引爆卫星
She's gonna drop a satellite on us!

890
01:19:56,770 --> 01:19:58,610
我若把信号阻塞就引爆不了
Not if I jam the signal!

891
01:20:01,610 --> 01:20:02,950
我需要电源
I need a power source!

892
01:20:04,610 --> 01:20:05,610
快去
Go!

893
01:20:05,780 --> 01:20:07,660
我独自一人过去吗
Over there? By myself?

894
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:12,830
快
Go!

895
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,290
掩护我
Cover me!

896
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:18,290
快散开
Fan out!

897
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:19,390
快 快
Go, go!

898
01:20:21,510 --> 01:20:23,170
快过去
Hurry up, over there!

899
01:20:34,890 --> 01:20:36,230
我来应付下侧的攻势
I go low.

900
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:37,900
我负责上方
Ill go high.

901
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:40,690
看看是否能找到 那个特种部队士兵
See if I can't find G.I. Joe.

902
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:07,340
你有接收到干扰信号吗
Are you getting this interference?

903
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:01,230
该死的
Shit.

904
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:03,990
把他们干掉 快
Take'em out, now!

905
01:22:11,990 --> 01:22:13,620
每个人都需要后备 对吗
Everyone needs backup, right?

906
01:22:13,950 --> 01:22:15,450
我想是的
Yeah, I guess.

907
01:22:51,450 --> 01:22:52,820
我们开始吧
Let's do this.

908
01:23:48,210 --> 01:23:49,550
尼克斯
Nicks!

909
01:23:50,710 --> 01:23:52,420
–我想到一个计划 –不
- I've got a plan! - No!

910
01:23:54,050 --> 01:23:55,390
不
No, no, no!

911
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:19,200
听好了 从现在开始 我来策划 你来执行
Listen! From now on, I make the plans, you execute!

912
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:28,310
该死的
Shit.

913
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:13,480
天啊 这太棒了
Oh, my God, this is fucking awesome!

914
01:26:28,370 --> 01:26:30,330
怎么了 不反驳吗
What's wrong, hotshot? No witty comeback?

915
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:33,210
我刚刚算出了 算术的解答
I just finally figured out that math problem.

916
01:26:46,890 --> 01:26:49,230
我得把你冲下马桶两次
It's gonna take two flushes.

917
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:54,580
上 上
Go, go, go!

918
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,740
数量太多了 我们走吧
Shit. Way too many. Let's get out of here.

919
01:27:01,030 --> 01:27:02,070
跟我们走
Get back! Come on!

920
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:03,700
妈的
Shit!

921
01:27:05,410 --> 01:27:06,910
我会死掉的
Oh, my, God, I'm gonna die.

922
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:14,130
快走
Move!

923
01:27:14,290 --> 01:27:15,750
往前
Push forward!

924
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:19,550
我们只剩这些了
This is all we've got.

925
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:22,090
拿下他们
Pin'em! Pin'em down!

926
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:24,760
我没子弹了 你们有吗
Damn! I'm out of bullets. You got any?

927
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:26,760
什么也没剩
No. Nothing.

928
01:27:29,140 --> 01:27:30,270
我也是
I'm empty.

929
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,110
我们数到三就出动
- We go on three. - Okay.

930
01:28:18,690 --> 01:28:19,690
你好啊
Wassu p?

931
01:28:22,190 --> 01:28:26,200
石头剪刀布… 手榴弹发射器
Rock, paper, scissor, grenade launcher.

932
01:28:28,330 --> 01:28:29,660
达瑞斯·斯通
Darius Stone.

933
01:28:30,540 --> 01:28:31,750
达瑞斯·斯通 2005年加入极限特工

934
01:28:31,830 --> 01:28:33,040
前美国海军军官

935
01:28:33,370 --> 01:28:36,290
花了11年时间 等待有人拨打9号

936
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:38,670
2005年加入极限特工
Triple-X since 2005.

937
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,500
谢谢你的协助
Thanks for the assist.

938
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,670
极限特工不会丢下彼此
X takes care of its own.

939
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:15,830
开什么玩笑
You got to be kidding.

940
01:29:34,350 --> 01:29:35,020
选择卫星

941
01:29:49,110 --> 01:29:50,450
我们失败了
We failed.

942
01:29:55,910 --> 01:29:59,380
玛克启动了卫星 现在正朝着我们的方向
Xander, Marke activated the satellite and it's headed right for us.

943
01:29:59,750 --> 01:30:01,920
我要像神风敢死队 迎面对抗
I'm gonna have to take it out kamikaze style.

944
01:30:02,090 --> 01:30:05,300
不 那是自杀式袭击 没人能够撑过那种降落距离
Don't do it. It's suicide. Nobody could survive that fall.

945
01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:07,760
让尼克斯备好摄像机
Tell Nicks to have that camera ready.

946
01:30:08,090 --> 01:30:11,100
低轨道自由落体 没有滑槽和大烟花
Low-orbit freefall, no chute and big fireworks.

947
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:19,600
听说死亡是最终的历险记
They say it's the last great adventure.

948
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:33,990
记得给我们寄明信片
Be sure to send a postcard.

949
01:30:57,680 --> 01:30:59,180
我是为了这种刺激而活的
I live forthis shit.

950
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:15,990
该死的
Shit.

951
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:34,030
尼克斯…
Nicks,

952
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:36,240
希望你有拍摄下来
I hope you got that on camera!

953
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:41,410
若没拍到就不算数
If it ain't on video, it didn't happen!

954
01:32:41,580 --> 01:32:44,710
好极了 兄弟 这玩意足以登上名人堂了
Yeah. Hall of Fame shit right here, bro.

955
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:47,580
–你知道我也能做到 对吗 –胡扯
You know I could've done that, right?

956
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:49,020
- 省省吧你 - 闭嘴
- Bullshit. - Shut up.

957
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:53,420
玛克怎么了
What happened to Marke?

958
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:55,470
她也许摔死了
The ground broke her fall.

959
01:33:23,620 --> 01:33:25,830
还不相信好人
Still don't believe in good guys?

960
01:33:27,290 --> 01:33:29,340
你若是有点使坏 也没关系
It's okay if you're a little bad.

961
01:33:35,510 --> 01:33:37,010
要多坏
How bad?

962
01:34:07,370 --> 01:34:09,040
那个降落…
Now, that right there,

963
01:34:09,710 --> 01:34:11,840
真是超凡的入场
that was a hell of an entrance.

964
01:34:12,630 --> 01:34:14,710
那台车子真是超绝
That's a hell of a car.

965
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:18,720
吉本斯要我看守好
Yeah. Gibbons told me to keep an eye on it.

966
01:34:19,050 --> 01:34:21,720
他说我到时候 就会明白了
He said I'd know why when I need to know why.

967
01:34:23,060 --> 01:34:24,560
我现在总算明白
Now I know why.

968
01:34:25,060 --> 01:34:27,310
和当年一样 原封不动
It's exactly the way I left it.

969
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:29,310
我有开出去赴约过
Itook iton adateortwo.

970
01:34:30,690 --> 01:34:32,520
极限特工不会丢下彼此
X takes care of its own.

971
01:34:32,820 --> 01:34:34,820
所以你才会及时出现
That's why I figured you'd come through.

972
01:34:35,030 --> 01:34:38,360
能够跟传奇人物桑德·凯奇 一同共事
To get a chance to work with the legendary Xander Cage?

973
01:34:38,650 --> 01:34:40,360
要到何处报名
Where do I sign up?

974
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:54,000
你知道自己杠上了 不好惹的家伙
You know, you done pissed on the wrong damn picnic.

975
01:34:54,550 --> 01:34:56,510
我们会被全世界通缉
The whole world gonna be looking for us.

976
01:35:01,340 --> 01:35:03,680
我还是会做出同样的选择
I wouldn't have it any other way.

977
01:36:38,940 --> 01:36:42,150
我们用奥古斯最爱的歌 来做完结吧
We thought we'd end with Augustus' favorite song.

978
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:43,990
哇 这套把戏真了不起
That's an impressive trick.

979
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:45,530
干嘛
What?

980
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:48,160
只有你一人 懂得如何装死
Think you're the only one who knows how to play dead?

981
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,040
上当了吧
Gotcha.

982
01:36:56,170 --> 01:36:59,170
参加自己的葬礼 那种感觉真离奇
This is some pretty surreal shit, being at your own funeral.

983
01:36:59,590 --> 01:37:02,040
我心中想着
∮And I think to myself∮

984
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:05,290
这世界的确可以很美好
∮What a wonderful World∮

985
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:08,060
我 真是爱死这首歌了
I love that song.

986
01:37:10,310 --> 01:37:12,520
我们若不做那么多坏事…
And it could be a wonderful world,

987
01:37:13,020 --> 01:37:15,190
这世界的确可以很美好
if we just stopped doing bad shit to it.

988
01:37:17,810 --> 01:37:20,690
你若想要我重出江湖 大可以开口
If you wanted me out of retirement, you could've just asked me.

989
01:37:21,150 --> 01:37:24,990
你一向来不会动心于 微不足道的动机
You always responded to less subtle motivation.

990
01:37:27,160 --> 01:37:28,160
现在要做什么
Now what?

991
01:37:28,370 --> 01:37:31,370
你继续当这世界 真正需要的反叛角色吧
You keep being the rebel the world doesn't know it needs.

992
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:35,370
看守好政府官员 打击内奸
Watch the watchers. Fight the enemy within.

993
01:37:35,660 --> 01:37:37,370
那太复杂了
Damn, that's so complicated.

994
01:37:37,540 --> 01:37:38,710
是吗
Really?

995
01:37:39,710 --> 01:37:41,710
让我为你简化
Let me simplify it for you.

996
01:37:42,210 --> 01:37:44,010
当个了不起的人物
Kick some ass.

997
01:37:44,380 --> 01:37:45,720
赢取女孩的欢心
Get the girl.

998
01:37:46,510 --> 01:37:49,510
途中尽量显得潇洒
And tryto look dope while you're doing it.

999
01:37:51,720 --> 01:37:53,390
你懂得如何 "潇洒"对吗
You can do "dope," can't you?

1000
01:37:55,230 --> 01:37:56,690
你肯定行的
Sure you can.

1001
01:38:01,070 --> 01:38:02,400
小内马尔 我们走吧
Junior, let's bounce!

1002
01:38:02,690 --> 01:38:04,400
回头见 桑德
I'll see you later, X.

1003
01:38:09,910 --> 01:38:12,740
这绝对行
I can definitely make that work.

1004
01:38:25,630 --> 01:38:26,920
我们开始吧
Let's do this.

1005
01:38:40,810 --> 01:38:41,770
我被你耍了
You got me.

1006
01:38:44,110 --> 01:38:45,110
骗到你了
Gotcha.

1007
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:49,280
我是玩家 不是士兵
I'm not a soldier, I'm a bailer.

1008
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:22,190
回头见 桑德
I'll see you later, X.

1009
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:41,000
你肯定行的
Sure you can.

1010
01:39:50,170 --> 01:39:51,130
再见
Bye-bye.
