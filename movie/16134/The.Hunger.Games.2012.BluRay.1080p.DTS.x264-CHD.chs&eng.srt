00:00:33,996 --> 00:00:36,570
引自叛国罪条款：
From the Treaty of the Treason:

4
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,684
为使叛乱者赎罪，每个地区每年都要
In penance for their uprising,each district shall offer up

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
公开“抽签”选择一对年龄
在12-18岁的少年男女作为贡品
a male and female between the ages of 12 and 18 at a public 'reaping'.

6
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,260
这些贡品会被送至都城凯匹特监管
(注：凯匹特为施惠国的都城，对旗下12个行政区
具有绝对统治权，是“饥饿游戏”的始作俑者)
These Tributes shall be delivered to the custody of the Capitol.

7
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,893
然后送至竞技场，他们将在那里战斗至死
直到剩下最后一名胜利者
（注：竞技场，饥饿游戏每届都会选择全新的比赛
场地，由荒废土地改建而成；比赛后成为旅游胜地）
And then transferred to a public arena where they will Fight to the Death, until a lone victor remains.

8
00:00:58,144 --> 00:01:01,600
这个盛会自此永远地被称为
{\1c&H0080FF&}饥饿游戏{\r}
Henceforth and forevermore this pageant shall be known as The Hunger Games.

9
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:02,646
我想这是我们的传统
<i>I think it's our tradition.</i>

10
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,108
它源于我们国家历史上极其惨痛的那段经历
It comes out of a particularly painful
part of our history.

11
00:01:06,192 --> 00:01:07,276
是的
Yes, yes.

12
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,362
但它已经成为使我们能够治愈痛苦的方式
But it's been the way
we've been able to heal.

13
00:01:10,446 --> 00:01:12,615
起初，这是对叛乱行为的警示
At first, it was a reminder of the rebellion.

14
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:15,534
- 叛乱地区必须因此而付出代价
- 对
- It was a price the districts had to pay.
- Yes.

15
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:17,870
但我认为现在更成熟了一些
But I think it has grown from that.

16
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:21,373
这可以让我们团结在一起
I think it's something
that knits us all together.

17
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,461
作为连续三年的游戏制作者
This is your third year as Gamemaker.

18
00:01:27,463 --> 00:01:30,591
您的座右铭是什么？
What defines your personal signature?

19
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:34,720
不！不！
No! No!

21
00:01:36,806 --> 00:01:41,227
没事，别怕，你只是在做梦，一个梦罢了
It's okay. It's okay. You were just dreaming.
You were dreaming.

22
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:44,647
我梦见被选中了
It was me.

23
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:48,859
我知道，但是事实不是这样的
I know. I know. But it's not.

24
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:52,154
这是你的第一年，普利姆
你的名字只在那出现过一次
It's your first year, Prim.
Your name's only been in there once.

25
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:54,323
他们不会选你的
They're not gonna pick you.

26
00:01:54,824 --> 00:01:56,575
再去睡会吧
Try to go to sleep.

27
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:57,868
我睡不着
I can't.

28
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:01,372
试试吧，躺下就睡着了
Just try. Just try.

在草丛深处

你还记得这歌？很好
You remember that song? Okay.

34
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:36,157
把它唱完，我得出去下
You finish it. I've got to go.

35
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,283
去哪？
Where?

36
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,326
我必须得走了
I've just got to go.

37
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:42,454
不过我会回来的，我爱你
<i>But I'll be back. I love you</i>

38
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,840
我还是要把你炖了

41
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:05,014
你打算怎么猎杀它？
What are you gonna do with that
when you kill it?

42
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:10,519
该死，盖尔！这并不好笑！
Damn you, Gale! It's not funny!

43
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:13,647
对于重达100磅的鹿你还能怎么办？凯特尼普
（注:女主角叫Katniss，为印地安语的慈菇之意，是伴水而生的植物，
根部可食用。由于发音类似，盖尔昵称她为Catnip，意为猫薄荷）
What are you gonna do
with a 100-pound deer, Catnip?

44
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:16,275
今天是抽签日，到处都是维和部队
It's Reaping Day.
The place is crawling with Peacekeepers.

45
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,486
我本打算把它卖给维和部队的
I was gonna sell it to some Peacekeepers.

46
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,779
当然
Of course you were.

47
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:22,114
就像你不卖给他们似的
Like you don't sell to Peacekeepers.

48
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,532
不，不是今天
No. Not today.

49
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,618
这可是今年我看到的第一头鹿
现在什么都没了
It was the first deer I've seen in a year.
Now I have nothing.

50
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:27,828
好吧
Okay.

51
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:21,173
如果他们不看了呢？只有一年
假使大家都不看饥饿游戏了呢？
What if they did? Just one year.
What if everyone just stopped watching?

52
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,384
- 不会的，盖尔
- 如果他们不看了呢？如果我们不看了呢？
- They won't, Gale.
- What if they did? What if we did?

53
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:25,010
不会的
Won't happen.

54
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:27,179
你会为自己喜欢的选手加油
一旦被杀你就会哭个不停
You root for your favorites.
You cry when they get killed.

55
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,514
- 真恶心
- 盖尔
- It's sick.
- Gale.

56
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:30,974
如果没人看，他们就没这个游戏
If no one watches,
then they don't have a game.

57
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,518
再简单不过
It's as simple as that.

58
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,186
- 什么？
- 没什么
- What?
- Nothing.

59
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:38,315
- 好吧，你就笑我吧
- 我没笑你
- Fine. Laugh at me.
- I'm not laughing at you.

60
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:46,198
我们能做到，你知道吗？
We could do it, you know?

61
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,411
离开这，在树林里生活，这就是我们要做的
Take off, live in the woods.
It's what we do anyway.

62
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:51,537
他们会把我们抓回来的
They'd catch us.

63
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,247
也许不会
Well, maybe not.

64
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:57,376
割掉我们的舌头，甚至更糟
我们跑不出五英里
Cut out our tongues, or worse.
We wouldn't make it five miles.

65
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:00,295
不，我已经跑出五英里了，我走的那条路
No, I'd get five miles. I'd go that way.

66
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:03,048
我这还有普利姆，你也有弟弟
I have Prim, and you have your brothers.

67
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:04,133
他们可以一起来
They can come, too.

68
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:05,926
让普利姆到树林里生活？
Prim in the woods?

69
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,263
也许未必
Or maybe not.

70
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:12,474
我没要过孩子
I'm never having kids.

71
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,727
我也许会要，如果不在这儿生活的话
I might, if I didn't live here.

72
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:17,980
- 但你就在这生活
- 我知道，我是说假如
- But you do live here.
- I know, but if I didn't.

73
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:22,901
差点忘了
I forgot.

74
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:24,570
给
Here.

75
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:27,239
天呐！真的吗？
Oh, my God! Is this real?

76
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,825
当然是真的，我用一个松鼠换的
Yeah. Better be. Cost me a squirrel.

77
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,744
饥饿游戏快乐

“希望好运永远站在你这边”
"And may the odds be ever in your favor."

79
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:42,754
今天你名字被用多少次了？
How many times is your name in today?

80
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:44,173
42次
Forty-two.

81
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:48,010
我看好运并不站在我这边
Guess the odds aren't exactly in my favor.

82
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,747
谢谢，闺女
Thank you, girl.

83
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,131
这是什么？
What's this?

84
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:28,717
这是“自由梦幻”
That's a Mockingjay.

85
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,262
多少钱？
How much?

86
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:37,309
- 拿着吧，归你了
- 谢谢
- You keep it. It's yours.
- Thank you.

看看你！
Look at you!

00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,995
真漂亮
You look beautiful.

90
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,706
但最好把这个掖在后面，小鸭子
But you better tuck in that tail,little duck.

91
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,416
我也给你准备了点东西
I laid something out for you, too.

92
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:05,420
好的
Okay.

93
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,905
现在你也很漂亮了
Now you look beautiful, too.

94
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,699
真希望我能像你一样
Wish I looked like you.

95
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:37,953
不，我希望像你一样漂亮，小鸭子
No. l wish I looked like you, little duck.

96
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,545
嘿，想看看今天我给你带什么了吗？
Hey. You want to see what I got you today?

97
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,551
这是自由梦幻胸针，可以保护你
It's a Mockingjay pin. To protect you.

98
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:58,015
只要你戴着它，就不会有霉运
And as long as you have it,
nothing bad will happen to you.

99
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,267
好么？我保证
Okay? I promise.

100
00:10:58,075 --> 00:10:59,951
普利姆，没事的
Prim, it's okay. It's okay.

101
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:01,787
现在开始登记了，好吗？
Okay. It's time to sign in now. Okay?

102
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,997
他们会戳一下你的手指取一点点血
They're gonna prick your finger
just to take a little bit of blood.

103
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,207
- 你之前不是说…
- 我知道
- You didn't say...
- I know.

104
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,875
并不会很痛，一点点而已
It doesn't hurt much. Just a little.

105
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:10,879
好么？登记完去和那些小朋友坐一起
然后我会去找你，明白么？
Okay? Go sit down there with the little kids.
I'll find you after. Okay?

欢迎！欢迎，欢迎
<i>Welcome! Welcome, welcome.</i>

114
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:27,497
饥饿游戏快乐
<i>Happy Hunger Games.</i>

115
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:31,918
希望好运永远站在你这边
<i>And may the odds be ever in your favor.</i>

116
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:37,799
现在，开始之前，我们有一部特别的影片
<i>Now, before we begin,
we have a very special film.</i>

117
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:41,553
为了大家从凯匹特一路带回来的
<i>Brought to you all the way from The Capitol.</i>

118
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,392
战争，可怕的战争
War. Terrible war.

119
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:49,978
战争
<i>War.</i>

120
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:55,734
可怕的战争，寡妇、孤儿和失去母亲的孩子
<i>Terrible war.
Widows, orphans, a motherless child.</i>

121
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:59,446
暴动使我们的国家陷入内乱
<i>This was the uprising that rocked our land.</i>

122
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,492
13区背叛了一直哺育、热爱
<i>Thirteen districts rebelled against
the country that fed them,</i>

123
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,410
和保护他们的祖国
<i>loved them, protected them.</i>

124
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:09,372
同胞之前互相残杀直至所剩无几
<i>Brother turned on brother
until nothing remained.</i>

125
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:14,336
之后便迎来和平，这是一次艰难的战斗，惨痛的胜利
<i>And then came the peace,
hard fought, sorely won.</i>

126
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:18,715
人们浩劫余生，一个新纪元诞生了
<i>A people rose up from the ashes,
and a new era was born.</i>

127
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:23,678
但自由是需要付出代价的，叛徒被击败了
<i>But freedom has a cost.
And the traitors were defeated.</i>

128
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:28,350
做为国民我们发誓永远不会让悲剧重演
<i>We swore as a nation
we would never know this treason again.</i>

129
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:33,647
所以法律规定施惠国的不同区域每年
<i>And so it was decreed that each year
the various districts of Panem</i>

130
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,359
要奉上一对少年男女作为贡品
<i>would offer up, in tribute,
one young man and woman</i>

131
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:42,614
为了荣誉、勇气和奉献战斗至死
<i>to fight to the death in a pageant of honor,
courage, and sacrifice.</i>

132
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:46,993
唯一的幸存者会变得非常富有
<i>The lone victor, bathed in riches,
would serve as a reminder</i>

133
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:50,121
以此彰显我们的慷慨和宽恕
<i>of our generosity and our forgiveness.</i>

134
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:52,874
这就是我们铭记过往
<i>This is how we remember our past.</i>

135
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:57,003
保护未来的方式
<i>This is how we safeguard our future.</i>

136
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:58,672
我很喜欢这段话！
<i>I just love that!</i>

137
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:05,136
现在，是时候让我们选择
<i>Now, the time has come for us to select</i>

138
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:09,099
一对勇敢的年轻男女
<i>one courageous young man and woman</i>

139
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:17,065
作为第74届年度饥饿游戏12区荣誉代表了
<i>for the honor of representing District 12
in the 74th Annual Hunger Games.</i>

140
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,903
像往常一样，女士优先
<i>As usual, ladies first.</i>

141
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,598
普利姆罗斯·埃弗丁
<i>Primrose Everdeen.</i>

142
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,607
亲爱的，你在哪？
<i>Where are you, dear?</i>

143
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,525
上来吧
<i>Come on up.</i>

144
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:03,320
来吧
<i>Well, come on up.</i>

145
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,469
普利姆！普利姆！
Prim! Prim!

146
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,471
不，不！
No. No!

147
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:31,723
我当志愿者！我要当志愿者！
I volunteer! I volunteer!

148
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:34,476
我自愿作为贡品！
I volunteer as Tribute!

149
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:40,732
我们拥有一位志愿者，市长先生
<i>I believe we have</i> a <i>volunteer, Mr. Mayor.</i>

150
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,776
普利姆，你得马上离开这，快走
Prim, you need to get out of here.
You need to get out of here.

151
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,194
- 不！不！
- 去找妈妈！
- No!No!
- Go find Mom!

152
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,904
- 普利姆，现在去找妈妈，很抱歉
- 不！
- Prim, go find Mom right now. I'm so sorry.
- No!

153
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:49,449
- 去找妈妈，普利姆，快走！去找妈妈！
- 不！不！不！
- Go find Mom. Prim, leave! Go find Mom.
- No!No!No!

154
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:53,119
不！不！不！
- No!No!No!
- Come on.

155
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:56,414
12区出现了戏剧性的转变
<i>A dramatic turn of events here in District 12.</i>

156
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,292
好了
<i>Yes, well.</i>

157
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:03,254
12区史上第一位志愿者
带她上来
<i>District 12's very first volunteer.
Bring her up.</i>

158
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:08,843
来，亲爱的
Come on, dear.

159
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,105
你叫什么名字？
<i>What's your name?</i>

160
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:21,856
凯特尼斯·埃弗丁
<i>Katniss Everdeen.</i>

161
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,860
我打赌她一定是你妹妹，对吗？
<i>Well, I bet my hat that was your sister,
wasn't it?</i>

162
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,363
是的
<i>Yes.</i>

163
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:34,828
让我们对第一位志愿者，凯特尼斯·埃弗丁，报以热烈掌声!
<i>Let's have a big hand for
our very first volunteer, Katniss Everdeen.</i>

164
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,885
现在轮到男孩了
<i>And now for the boys.</i>

165
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,230
皮塔·麦拉克
<i>Peeta Mellark.</i>

166
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:27,505
人齐了
<i>Here we are.</i>

167
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:31,426
这就是我们12区的贡品
<i>Our Tributes from District 12.</i>

168
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,387
好了，你们俩握个手吧
<i>Well, go on, you two, shake hands.</i>

169
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,569
饥饿游戏快乐
<i>Happy Hunger Games.</i>

170
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:53,865
希望好运永远站在你这边
<i>And may the odds be ever in your favor.</i>

171
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:08,880
给你三分钟
You have three minutes.

172
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:13,593
没事的
It's okay.

173
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:18,264
普利姆，普利姆，没事
普利姆，我没多少时间了
Prim. Prim. It's okay.
Prim, I don't have much time.

174
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:22,894
普利姆，听着，你会没事的
不要从他们那拿走额外的食物
Prim. Listen. You're gonna be okay.
Don't take any extra food from them.

175
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,188
这不值得多次记录你的名字，好吗？
It isn't worth putting your name in
more times. Okay?

176
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:29,234
听着，普利姆，盖尔会带你玩的
你可以把羊奶酪卖掉
Listen, Prim. Gale will bring you game.
You can sell cheese from your goat.

177
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,903
要努力赢得比赛，也许你可以的
Just try to win. Maybe you can.

178
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:33,988
当然
Of course.

179
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:36,991
或许我能赢的，我很聪明，知道么？
And maybe I can. I am smart, you know?

180
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:39,828
- 你会打猎
- 对呀
- And you can hunt.
- Exactly.

181
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,836
保护你
To protect you.

182
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,676
谢谢
Thank you.

183
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:58,266
（注：所有12-18岁的少男少女均可申请
食物兑换卷，领取1人1年份的粮食与油）

184
00:18:59,421 --> 00:19:01,963
（这份优惠同样需要付出相应的代价
一张兑换券等于增加一次抽签名条）

185
00:19:03,124 --> 00:19:07,022
（对于穷人来说无异于提高自己成为贡品的几率
因此凯特尼斯在离开前嘱咐妹妹不要领取食物兑换券）

186
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,899
你不能再被选为贡品了
You can't tune out again.

187
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:13,862
- 不会的
- 不，你不能。别像爸爸死的时候一样
- I won't.
- No, you can't. Not like when Dad died.

188
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,613
我不能再到那了，你就是她的一切
I won't be there anymore. You're all she has.

189
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:18,741
无论你是怎么想的，你必须为了她去那，明白吗？
No matter what you feel, you have to
be there for her. Do you understand?

190
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,786
别哭
Don't cry.

191
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,458
别哭，别哭，别
Don't cry. Don't. Don't.

192
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,671
- 时间到了
- 普利姆，没事的
- It's time.
- Prim, it's okay.

193
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:35,633
- 普利姆，别担心，没事，普利姆
- 不！不！不！
- Prim, it's okay. It's okay, Prim.
- No!No!No!

194
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:37,677
我保证，普利姆
I promise, Prim.

195
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:56,613
- 我很好
- 我知道
- I'm fine.
- Yeah, I know.

196
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:57,906
真没事
I am.

197
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:02,827
听我说，你比他们任何一个人都优秀
Listen to me. You're stronger than they are.
You are.

198
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,162
- 弄一个弓
- 他们可能没有…
- Get to a bow.
- They may not have...

199
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:06,497
如果你足够优秀他们会想办法的
They will if you show them
how good you are.

200
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:08,708
人们只是想要一场好看的比赛
仅此而已
They just want a good show.
That's all they want.

201
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,627
如果他们没有弓，你就做一个，好么？
If they don't have a bow,
then you make one, okay?

202
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,211
你知道如何狩猎
You know how to hunt.

203
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:13,546
动物
Animals.

204
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:16,341
这没什么不同，凯特尼斯
It's no different, Katniss.

205
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:21,512
我们有24个人，盖尔，只有一个人能活着
There's 24 of us, Gale. Only one comes out.

206
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:23,765
这个人一定是你
Yeah. And it's gonna be you.

207
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:25,391
好了
Okay.

208
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,644
照顾好她们，盖尔
无论怎样，别让他们挨饿
Take care of them, Gale.
Whatever you do, don't let them starve.

209
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,771
- 走吧
- 我会尽快再见到你的，好吗？
- Let's go.
- I'll see you soon, okay?

210
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:34,692
你们俩会喜欢的
You two are in for a treat.

211
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:38,446
水晶吊灯，白金门把手，速度快极了
Crystal chandeliers, platinum doorknobs,
and it flies.

212
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,698
我们会在凯匹特停留不到两天
We'll be at The Capitol
in less than two days.

213
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:43,284
现在，在你做其他事之前…
Now, before you do anything else...

214
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,260
200英里每小时，几乎没什么感觉
<i>200 miles per hour,
and you can barely feel a thing.</i>

215
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:45,096
即使你们在这，哪怕只有一小会
I think it's one of the wonderful things about
this opportunity,

216
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:48,725
我想这次机遇也是一件很美妙的事情
that even though you're here
and even though it's just for a little while,

217
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,352
你们可以享受这里的一切
you get to enjoy all of this.

218
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:59,444
我去找黑密斯，他可能在酒吧车厢那
I'm going to find Haymitch.
He's probably in the bar car.

219
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:13,374
你之前见过他吗？
Have you ever met him?

220
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:17,420
黑密斯？
Haymitch?

221
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:25,887
你知道的，凯特尼斯，他是我们的导师，赢过一次比赛
You know, Katniss, he is our mentor.
He did win this thing once.

222
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,146
好吧，如果你不想和我交谈，我理解
Look, you know,
if you don't want to talk, I understand,

223
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:38,441
但我不认为想得到一点帮助有什么错的
but I just don't think there's anything wrong
with getting a little bit of help.

224
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,926
恭喜
Congratulations.

225
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,488
冰块呢？
Where's the ice?

226
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:28,449
不知道
I don't know.

227
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:35,957
可以坐下吗？
May I?

228
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:44,549
好的，我们什么时候开始？
Okay, so... So when do we start?

229
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,343
太心切了
So eager.

230
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:50,638
多数人都没这么猴急
Most of you aren't in such a hurry.

231
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:53,224
我想知道计划是什么，你是我俩的导师啊
Yeah. I wanna know what the plan is.
You're our mentor.

232
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:54,642
- 你应该…
- 导师？
- You're supposed to go...
- Mentor?

233
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,019
是啊，我们的导师
Yeah, our mentor.

234
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,772
你应该告诉我们如何获得赞助并给些建议
You're supposed to tell us
how to get sponsors and give us advice.

235
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:01,732
好吧
Okay.

236
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:07,155
做好有可能将死的准备
Embrace the probability
of your imminent death.

237
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:14,370
要知道，在你们心中，我救不了你们
And know, in your heart,
that there's nothing I can do to save you.

238
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,373
那你为什么还在这？
So why are you here then?

239
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:19,625
不愁吃喝
The refreshments.

240
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:21,169
好吧，够了
Okay, I think that's enough of that.

241
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:29,594
你把我的酒碰洒了，这可是条新裤子
You made me spill my drink.
These are brand new pants.

242
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:34,682
你懂的，等我回屋会把它喝完的
You know, I think I'll go
finish this in my room.

243
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:52,575
他快醒酒了
He's gonna come around.

244
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:53,784
没用的
It's no use.

245
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:55,786
我去和他谈谈
I'm gonna go talk to him.

246
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:05,838
我们有两位非常合适的16岁队员
<i>We have two very fit 16-year-olds.</i>

247
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:09,258
当然，他们总是能够提供优秀的竞争对手
<i>Of course, of course.
They always provide pretty good opponents.</i>

248
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:10,676
是啊
<i>Yes, yes, they do.</i>

249
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,637
- 还记得这一年吗？
- 当然
<i>- Do you remember this year?
- Of course.</i>

250
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,307
我最喜欢的比赛之一，阿瑞纳斯表现很棒
<i>One of my favorite years.
And one of my favorite Arenas.</i>

251
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:19,310
利用荒废城市里的碎石
<i>The use of the rubble in the ruined city...</i>

252
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,645
真令人兴奋
<i>Very exciting.</i>

253
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:22,313
这个时刻
<i>And this moment here,</i>

254
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:24,982
你永远不会忘记
<i>this moment is a moment
that you never forget.</i>

255
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:26,400
是的
<i>Yes.</i>

256
00:25:26,484 --> 00:25:29,570
当贡品变成胜利者的时刻
<i>The moment when a Tribute
becomes a victor.</i>

257
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:07,650
- 首先，你会被冻死
- 不会的，我可以点火
- You'd freeze to death first.
- No, because I'd light a fire.

258
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,360
是个找死的好办法
That's a good way to get killed.

259
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:11,028
什么找死的好办法？
What's a good way to get killed?

260
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:15,074
有意思，怎么不过来和我们一起聊聊？
Joy. Why don't you join us?

261
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:18,911
我只是给些生存建议
I was just giving some life-saving advice.

262
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:21,497
比如说？
Like what?

263
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,874
我刚才问他如何找到避难所
I was just asking about how to find shelter.

264
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:28,045
这些迟早有用，实际上你们还活着
Which would come in handy if,
in fact, you were still alive.

265
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:31,799
你怎么找到避难所的？
How do you find shelter?

266
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:34,010
果酱给我
Pass the jam.

267
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,678
你怎么找到避难所的？
How do you find shelter?

268
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:38,556
宝贝，让我喘口气吧
Give me a chance to wake up , sweetheart.

269
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:43,894
作为导师，这活可不轻松
This mentoring is very taxing stuff.

270
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,402
能把果酱递给我吗？
Can you pass the marmalade?

271
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:54,739
那可是红木！
That is mahogany!

272
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:58,993
看看你，对餐具垫发什么火
Look at you. Just killed a placemat.

273
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:02,747
你真想知道如何才能生存下来吗？
You really want to know how to stay alive?

274
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,000
你得让观众喜欢你
You get people to like you.

275
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:11,172
并不是你所期望的那样
Not what you were expecting?

276
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:17,470
当你处于游戏当中，你会挨饿挨冻
Well, when you're in the middle of
The Games and you're starving or freezing,

277
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:20,973
水、刀子，甚至是火柴
some water, a knife, or even some matches

278
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:23,559
都关乎你的生死
can mean the difference
between life and death.

279
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:27,063
这些东西取决于赞助商
And those things only come from sponsors.

280
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:31,734
想获得赞助商的青睐，你必须让观众喜欢你
And to get sponsors,
you have to make people like you.

281
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:38,240
宝贝，现在你离一个好的开头并不远了
And right now, sweetheart,
you're not off to a real good start.

282
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,576
就是那
There it is.

283
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:47,208
真壮观！
It's huge!

284
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:49,835
不可思议
That's incredible.

285
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:16,028
皮塔，我爱你
Peeta, I love you.

286
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,831
来，来啊
Come on. Come on.

287
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:35,297
你最好留着这把刀，他清楚自己在做什么
You better keep this knife.
He knows what he's doing.

288
00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:47,852
现在你已经看到他们了
<i>So now that you've seen them,</i>

289
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:50,729
你认为今年的新选手怎么样？
<i>what do you think about
this year's crop of recruits?</i>

290
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:54,024
有什么值得期待的亮点吗？
Are there any surprises
that we can expect this year?

291
00:28:54,108 --> 00:28:55,651
仅从抽签来看真的很难说
It's really hard to tell just from a Reaping,

292
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:59,155
- 但我认为这将是一场非常有趣的混战
- 没错
-but I think this is a very interesting mix.
- Yes.

293
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:01,449
而且这次还有一位边远区域的志愿者
And whenever you have a volunteer
from an outlying district,

294
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:03,868
这绝对是个看点
<i>that's something you can't ignore.</i>

295
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:32,480
那是什么？
What's that?

296
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:34,982
那是什么？
What's that?

297
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:37,234
我们只是在谈论在你见西纳之前
We're just saying we might need
to hose you down again

298
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:39,445
可能需要再帮你冲洗一遍
before we take you to Cinna.

299
00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:50,206
替妹妹作为贡品，这是我见过的最勇敢的行为
That was one of the bravest things
I've ever seen. With your sister?

300
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:52,500
- 我叫西纳
- 凯特尼斯
- My name's Cinna.
- Katniss.

301
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,044
对于你的遭遇感到很抱歉
I'm sorry that this happened to you,

302
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,087
我会尽我所能帮助你
and I'm here to help you
in any way that I can.

303
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,634
多数人只是恭喜我罢了
Most people just congratulate me.

304
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:04,011
我不会那么想
Well, I don't see the point in that.

305
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:08,057
今晚有贡品巡游活动
So tonight, they have the Tribute Parade.

306
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:12,102
我要让全世界看到你有多漂亮
I'm gonna take you out
and show you off to the world.

307
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:13,938
你在这就是为了打扮我？
So you're here to make me look pretty?

308
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,356
我是为了让观众对有个好印象
I'm here to help you make an impression.

309
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,276
通常他们根据贡品所在区域特点来打扮
Now, usually they dress people
in the clothes from their district.

310
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,737
- 好啊，我们那全是矿工
- 我不会那么干的
- Yeah, we're always coalminers.
- Yeah, but I don't wanna do that.

311
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,241
我要做的一定会令他们难忘
I wanna do something
that they're gonna remember.

312
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,868
他们跟你说过如何才能获得赞助商吗？
Did they explain
about trying to get sponsors?

313
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:30,663
说了，但我并不擅长交朋友
Yeah, but I'm not very good
at making friends.

314
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:32,331
走着瞧吧
We'll see.

315
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:36,126
我想有胆量的人
I just think somebody that brave

316
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:41,382
不应该穿得太随便，对吗？
shouldn't be dressed up
in some stupid costume, now should they?

317
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,219
希望如此
I hope not.

318
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:54,478
我保证这很安全
Okay, this is safe. I promise.

319
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:57,815
这不是真正的火焰，衣服是量身定做的
不会感到任何不适
It's not real fire. These suits are built
so you won't feel a thing.

320
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,149
看起来真的很合身
Looks pretty real to me.

321
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:00,818
就是这意思
Well, that's the idea.

322
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:01,902
准备好了吗？
You ready?

323
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:04,446
- 别害怕
- 我不怕
- Don't be afraid.
- I'm not afraid.

324
00:31:24,842 --> 00:31:30,264
超过10万人正迫不及待的等着观赏今年的贡品
Over 100,000 people craning
to get a glimpse of this year's Tributes.

325
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:33,350
赞助商们也是第一次看到这些贡品
<i>And the sponsors get to see the Tributes
for the first time.</i>

326
00:31:33,434 --> 00:31:36,353
此刻的重要性无需赘言
The importance of this moment
cannot be overstated.

327
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:42,651
很好
Very nice.

328
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:47,948
第一辆战车入场倒计时开始，15,14，13…
First chariot on my count, in 15, 14, 13...

329
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:53,954
来了，他们来啦，今年的贡品们
There they are. There they are.
This year's Tributes.

330
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:56,040
真令人激动
<i>It's the most exciting part.</i>

331
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:58,042
鸡皮疙瘩都起来了
<i>It just gives you goose bumps.</i>

332
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,252
太喜欢这些设计师了
<i>And don't you love how the stylists,</i>

333
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:04,631
他们是怎么把每个区域选手的特色
如此清晰呈现出来的？
they so clearly are able to
reflect the character of each district?

334
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,718
- 没错，第4区的选手来了
- 是啊
<i>- Right. Right. There's District 4.
- Yes.</i>

335
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:09,720
- 鱼类装扮
- 我看见了
<i>- Fishing.
- I get it.</i>

336
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,972
- 我喜欢
- 很不错
<i>- I like it.
- That's very good.</i>

337
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:17,102
在他们后面有两位电厂工人，对吗？
And behind them,
we have two power plant workers. Right?

338
00:32:17,186 --> 00:32:18,562
然后呢…
And then...

339
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,899
最后那个是什么？
What is that in the background?

340
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:49,843
来吧，他们喜欢这样。
Come on. They'll love it.

341
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:57,935
耶！
Yeah!

342
00:32:58,018 --> 00:32:59,478
看到了吗？我喜欢
<i>Now see that? I love that.</i>

343
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:02,272
两个年轻人高举紧握在一起的双手
<i>Two young people
holding their hands up, saying,</i>

344
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:06,151
喊着“我为来自12区感到自豪，我们不会被忽视的”
<i>"I'm proud I come from District 12.
We will not be overlooked."</i>

345
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:07,403
- 当然不会
- 真棒我喜欢
- Nope.
- I love that!

346
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:10,197
所有人的注意力都集中在他们身上
<i>People are sure gonna be paying attention
to them right now.</i>

347
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:14,326
准备好了
And we're ready.

348
00:33:14,535 --> 00:33:15,911
斯诺总统，该你了
<i>President Snow, you're live.</i>

349
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:47,651
欢迎
<i>Welcome.</i>

350
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:52,823
欢迎
<i>Welcome.</i>

351
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:57,286
贡品们，欢迎你们的到来！
<i>Tributes, we welcome you.</i>

352
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:04,334
对于你们的勇气和奉献精神我们深表敬意
<i>We salute your courage and your sacrifice.</i>

353
00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:10,090
祝愿你们
<i>And we wish you</i>

354
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:14,094
饥饿游戏快乐
<i>Happy Hunger Games.</i>

355
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:18,432
希望好运永远站在你这边
<i>And may the odds be ever in your favor.</i>

356
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:33,030
简直难以置信
That was amazing.

357
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:35,616
所有人都在讨论你们
We are all
anybody's going to be talking about.

358
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,367
真够大胆的
So brave.

359
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:39,578
你确信自己呆在我这团烈火旁会没事吗？
Are you sure you should be
near an open flame?

360
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:42,998
火焰道具吗？你确信…
Fake flame? Are you sure you...

361
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:54,551
咱们上楼吧
Let's go upstairs.

362
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:00,432
每个区域都有属于自己的楼层
So, each of the districts get their own floor.

363
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:03,977
因为你们来自12区，所以阁楼是你们的
And because you're from 12,
you get the penthouse.

364
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:12,486
来
Come on.

365
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:18,617
这是客厅
So this is the living room.

366
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:21,495
我知道
I know, I know.

367
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:24,998
你们的卧室在这
Now, your rooms are right over here.

368
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:28,835
在晚餐开始之前为什么不先去洗个澡呢？
Why don't you go clean yourselves up
a little before dinner?

369
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:50,208
两周内，会有23个人死掉
In two weeks, 23 of you will be dead.

370
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:52,252
只有一个幸存者
One of you will be alive.

371
00:36:52,336 --> 00:36:56,715
这取决于你们是否在意接下来的四天
Who that is depends on how well
you pay attention over the next four days,

372
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:59,384
尤其是我将要说的这些事
particularly to what I'm about to say.

373
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:02,554
首先，不要和其它选手打斗
First, no fighting with the other Tributes.

374
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:04,514
在竞技场你们有的是时间
You'll have plenty of time for that
in the Arena.

375
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:09,478
有四个必修练习，其余的是个人训练
There are four compulsory exercises.
The rest will be individual training.

376
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,564
我建议你们不要忽视生存技能
My advice is don't ignore the survival skills.

377
00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:14,232
每个人都想夺取利剑
Everybody wants to grab a sword,

378
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:17,027
但多数人都会死于自然因素
but most of you will die
from natural causes.

379
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:20,989
10%的人死于感染，20%的人死于脱水
10% from infection, 20% from dehydration.

380
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,950
暴晒能像刀子一样轻易致人死地
Exposure can kill as easily as a knife.

381
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:58,485
- 杰森，我的刀呢？
- 我没碰你的刀
- Jason, where's my knife, huh?
- I didn't touch your knife.

382
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:01,154
- 我就把刀放那了！
- 别碰我，我没拿你的刀！
- I put my knife right there!
- Don't touch me. I didn't touch your knife!

383
00:38:01,238 --> 00:38:02,781
- 你拿了！
- 我没拿！
- Yes, you took my knife!
- I didn't touch your knife!

384
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:04,449
- 你拿我的刀了，骗子！
- 我没拿
- You took my knife, you liar!
- I didn't touch your knife.

385
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:05,534
- 骗子！
- 我没拿！
- You liar!
- I didn't touch your knife!

386
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,744
臭小子！他拿我刀！
You little punk! He took my knife!

387
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:09,579
- 放开我！
- 我一直坐在这
- Get off me!
- I'm just sitting here.

388
00:38:09,663 --> 00:38:12,249
我现在就把你干掉，臭小子！
I'll finish you right now, kid!

389
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:14,042
好啊，我在竞技场等你
Actually, better yet, I'll wait for the Arena.

390
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:15,627
我第一个就去收拾你，给我小心点
You're the first one I get,
so watch your back.

391
00:38:19,423 --> 00:38:22,300
- 大家退后！
- 你知道你得罪谁了，臭小子！
- Everybody, back in line!
- You know who you're messing with, kid!

392
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:24,761
他是职业干这个的，知道什么意思吗？
He's a Career. You know what that is?

393
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:26,847
- 从第1区来的
- 还有第2区
- From District 1.
- And 2.

394
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:30,767
他们18岁前都在专门的培训机构训练
然后作为志愿者参赛
They train in a special academy
until they're 18. Then they volunteer.

395
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:34,062
这也就意味着他们很难对付
By that point, they're pretty lethal.

396
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:36,231
但他们没有任何特殊待遇
But they don't receive any special treatment.

397
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,817
实际上，他们和你们呆在相同的房间内
In fact, they stay in the exact
same apartment as you do.

398
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,903
他们没有餐后甜点可以吃，而你们却有
And I don't think they let them have dessert.
And you can.

399
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:44,698
他们实力有多强？
So how good are they?

400
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:49,286
显然他们很优秀，差不多每年都会获胜，但…
Obviously they're pretty good.
They win it almost every year, but...

401
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:50,620
差不多
Almost.

402
00:38:50,871 --> 00:38:52,873
他们太自大了
...they can be arrogant.

403
00:38:53,457 --> 00:38:56,960
自大是个严重问题
And arrogance can be a big problem.

404
00:38:59,296 --> 00:39:01,298
听说你会射箭
I hear you can shoot.

405
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,302
还好吧
I'm all right.

406
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:07,929
她射箭技术很好的，我爸买过她的松鼠
No, she's better than all right.
My father buys her squirrels.

407
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:12,058
他说她每次都是箭无虚发
He says she hits them
right in the eye every time.

408
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,645
- 皮塔很强壮
- 什么？
- Peeta's strong.
- What?

409
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:18,148
他可以把100磅的面粉举过头顶，我见过
He can throw a 100-pound sack
of flour right over his head. I've seen it.

410
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:20,609
好吧，我可不会用一袋面粉杀人
Okay, well, I'm not gonna kill
anybody with a sack of flour.

411
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,319
但你可以用更好的方式获胜
No, but you might have
a better chance of winning

412
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:23,653
如果有人拿刀过来
if somebody comes after you with a knife.

413
00:39:23,737 --> 00:39:26,782
我赢不了！赢不了！懂吗？
I have no chance of winning!
None! All right?

414
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:35,081
这是真的，大家都知道
It's true. Everybody knows it.

415
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:40,420
你知道我妈怎么说的吗？
You know what my mother said?

416
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:43,840
他说12区可能会有一个胜者
She said District 12
might finally have a winner.

417
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:46,009
但她说的不是我
But she wasn't talking about me.

418
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:49,471
是你
She was talking about you.

419
00:39:54,935 --> 00:39:56,686
我不太饿
I'm not very hungry.

420
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:35,851
我也吃完了
I'm done, too.

421
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,520
把那个金属东西扔过去
Throw that metal thing over there.

422
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:21,980
什么？
What?

423
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:27,193
不，黑密斯说过不让我们展露自己的才能
No. Haymitch said we're not supposed
to show our skills.

424
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:28,278
我不管黑密斯怎么说的
I don't care what Haymitch said.

425
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:30,405
那几个家伙视你为砧板鱼肉
Those guys are looking at you
like you're a meal.

426
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,573
扔过去
Throw it.

427
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:17,661
嗨
Hi.

428
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,621
嗨
Hey.

429
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:21,456
你怎么做到的？
How did you do that?

430
00:42:21,915 --> 00:42:25,251
我过去经常在面包店做蛋糕美化工作
I used to decorate the cakes
down at the bakery.

431
00:42:26,503 --> 00:42:27,921
给你看看
I'll show you.

432
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:31,257
看到了吗？
See?

433
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,052
看到了
Yeah.

434
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:37,931
有人跟着你
Hey, I think you have a shadow.

435
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:07,961
明天他们会把你们一个接一个的带进去
并且评估你们的能力
Tomorrow, they'll bring you in one by one
and evaluate you.

436
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,923
这点很重要，因为打分较高的意味着会有更多的赞助
This is important, because higher ratings
will mean sponsors.

437
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:14,718
是时候崭露头角了
This is the time to show them everything.

438
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:17,637
在那会有个弓，你一定要好好利用
There'll be a bow. Make sure you use it.

439
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:19,472
皮塔，你也一定要展示出你的力量
Peeta, you make sure to show your strength.

440
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:24,019
他们会从第1区开始，所以你们会排在最后
They'll start with District 1,
so the two of you will go last.

441
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:28,565
不知道该怎么说，总之一定要让他们记住你们
I don't know how else to put this.
Make sure they remember you.

442
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:42,287
凯特尼斯·埃弗丁
<i>Katniss Everdeen.</i>

443
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,425
嘿，凯特尼斯？
Hey, Katniss?

444
00:43:56,009 --> 00:43:57,802
好好表现
Shoot straight.

445
00:44:58,154 --> 00:44:59,781
凯特尼斯·埃弗丁
Katniss Everdeen.

446
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:02,909
12区的
District 12.

447
00:46:29,746 --> 00:46:30,914
嘿，嘿，嘿
Hey, hey, hey-

448
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:34,500
嘿，谁点的乳猪？谁点的乳猪？嘿！
Hey, who ordered this pig?
Who ordered this pig? Hey!

449
00:46:34,584 --> 00:46:35,877
你吃过乳猪没？
Did you get some pig yet?

450
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:56,522
谢谢，仅供您参考
Thank you for your consideration.

451
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:04,447
- 你疯了吗？
- 我太生气了
- Are you crazy?
- I just got mad.

452
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,657
生气？
Mad?

453
00:47:06,366 --> 00:47:11,454
你得意识到你的不良举动会影响整个团队
不只是你自己
You realize that your actions reflect badly
on all of us. Notjust you.

454
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:13,081
他们只是想要一场好看的比赛，没事的
They just want a good show. It's fine.

455
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:16,751
这么没礼貌你觉得会怎么样，西纳！
会怎么样？
How about it's just bad manners, Cinna!
How about that?

456
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:21,256
好吧，我希望你注意到我们的形势很严峻
Well, finally! I hope you noticed
we have a serious situation.

457
00:47:25,093 --> 00:47:27,136
干得漂亮，宝贝
Nice shooting, sweetheart.

458
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:32,642
当你射中苹果时他们什么反应？
What did they do when you shot the apple?

459
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,061
他们都惊呆了
Well, they looked pretty startled.

460
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:36,437
耶
Yeah.

461
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:40,984
你说什么来着？“谢谢…”
Now, what did you say? "Thanks for..."

462
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:42,652
- 谢谢，仅供您参考
- “…供您参考”
- Thanks for your consideration.
-"...your consideration."

463
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:45,071
天才！天才！
Genius! Genius.

464
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:49,826
如果游戏制作者想把我们踢出局的话
我想就没这么好笑了
I don't think we're gonna find this funny
if the Gamemakers decide to take it out...

465
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:51,369
踢谁？她？
On who? On her?

466
00:47:52,245 --> 00:47:53,663
还是他？
On him?

467
00:47:53,746 --> 00:47:56,749
我认为他们已经具备参赛资格了
放轻松，喝一杯
I think they already have.
Loosen your corset, have a drink.

468
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:00,420
我原本会不惜一切代价看到结果的
I would have given anything to see it.

469
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:04,173
正如你们所知道的，经过三天的仔细评估
<i>As you know, the Tributes were rated
on a scale of 1 to 12</i>

470
00:48:04,257 --> 00:48:07,093
1至12区的贡品评分结果出来了
<i>after three days of careful evaluation.</i>

471
00:48:07,302 --> 00:48:10,888
游戏管理人得知了一个非常意外的…
<i>The Gamekeepers would like
to acknowledge that it was an exceptional...</i>

472
00:48:11,431 --> 00:48:16,311
来自第1区的，漫威，9分
<i>From District 1, Marvel, with a score of nine.</i>

473
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:19,939
来自第2区的，卡托，10分
<i>From District 2, Cato, with a score of 10.</i>

474
00:48:20,023 --> 00:48:22,233
克劳芙，10分
<i>Clove, with a score of 10.</i>

475
00:48:22,317 --> 00:48:25,528
来自第3区的…
来自第4区的…
<i>From District 3...
From District 4, with a score of...</i>

476
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:26,988
来自第7区的
<i>From District 7...</i>

477
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:28,740
来自第8区的…
<i>From District 8...</i>

478
00:48:29,449 --> 00:48:32,118
茹，7分
<i>And Rue with a score of seven.</i>

479
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:33,911
最后一个区了
<i>Now our final district.</i>

480
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:38,666
来自第12区的，皮塔·麦拉克
<i>From District 12. Peeta Mellark.</i>

481
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:45,173
8分
<i>A score of eight.</i>

482
00:48:46,466 --> 00:48:47,759
- 棒极了
- 皮塔！
- Excellent.
- Peeta!

483
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:48,885
精彩
Bravo.

484
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:51,179
- 我们能做到的
- 干得好
- We can work with that.
- Good job.

485
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:54,974
最后一位
<i>And finally,</i>

486
00:48:57,477 --> 00:48:58,853
来自第12区的
<i>from District 12,</i>

487
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:03,232
凯特尼斯·埃弗丁
<i>Katniss E verdeen.</i>

488
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:08,488
分数是…
<i>With a score of...</i>

489
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:12,658
11分！
<i>Eleven.</i>

490
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:16,496
- 凯特尼斯！
- 难以置信！
- Katniss!
- Outstanding!

491
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:18,039
- 太好了！
- 11分？
- Yes!
- Eleven?

492
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:20,208
恭喜你
Congratulations.

493
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:21,626
我以为他们恨死我了
I thought they hated me.

494
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:23,044
他们喜欢你的勇气
They must have liked your guts.

495
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:27,256
敬凯特尼斯·埃弗丁，燃烧女孩！
To Katniss Everdeen, The Girl on Fire!

496
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:30,176
天呐
Goodness. We are.

497
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:31,511
有个11分？
An 11?

498
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:32,970
她应得的
She earned it.

499
00:49:33,054 --> 00:49:35,098
她把箭射在你脑袋上
She shot an arrow at your head.

500
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:36,474
是苹果上
Well, at an apple.

501
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:37,809
离你脑袋也不远了
Near your head.

502
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:39,852
坐下
Sit down.

503
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:48,194
塞内卡，你想想为什么我们要选出一名胜者？
Seneca, why do you think we have a winner?

504
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:52,031
您的意思是？
What do you mean?

505
00:49:52,949 --> 00:49:56,702
我的意思是为什么要一个人活下来？
I mean, why do we have a winner?

506
00:49:59,288 --> 00:50:01,207
如果我们只是威胁其它的区域
I mean, if we just wanted to
intimidate the districts,

507
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:05,878
为什么不随机选24个人组到一起让他们立刻比赛呢？
why not round up 24 of them at random
and execute them all at once?

508
00:50:05,962 --> 00:50:07,713
这样多块
Be a lot faster.

509
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:11,134
希望
Hope.

510
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:13,177
希望什么？
Hope?

511
00:50:13,261 --> 00:50:14,345
希望
Hope.

512
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:18,307
这是唯一强于恐惧的
It is the only thing stronger than fear.

513
00:50:19,809 --> 00:50:23,604
一点希望可以让人绝处逢生
希望太大的话是很危险的
A little hope is effective.
A lot of hope is dangerous.

514
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:26,983
火花可以有，但一定得能控制住
A spark is fine, as long as it's contained.

515
00:50:29,444 --> 00:50:30,445
所以…
So...

516
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:34,657
让一切都在可掌控的范围内
So contain it.

517
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:38,244
好的
Right.

518
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:41,581
她目不转睛的盯着我身上的珠宝
So she's staring at all my jewels.
She cannot take her eyes off of them.

519
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:44,083
- 是啊，从上到下打量一遍
- 说真的，这太无礼了
- Well, look at all that that you're wearing.
- Frankly, it was rude.

520
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:46,794
黑密斯，一起来吧
Haymitch, you should join us.

521
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:49,338
晚餐有你的最爱
We're having some of
your favorite for dinner.

522
00:50:49,422 --> 00:50:50,590
那太好了
Lovely.

523
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:56,554
- 皮塔呢？
- 他在房间里
- Where's Peeta?
- He's in his room.

524
00:50:56,637 --> 00:51:00,516
听着，明天是最后一天
Now, listen, tomorrow's the last day.

525
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,227
比赛前他们让我们和自己的队员呆在一起
And they let us work with our own Tributes
right before The Games,

526
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:06,105
所以咱俩9点前得呆在一起
so you and I will be going down at 9:00.

527
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,108
他呢？
What about him?

528
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:13,279
他说从现在开始想一个人训练
He says he wants to be trained
on his own from now on.

529
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:15,615
什么？
What?

530
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:21,162
这个时候还说这种事，赢家只有一个，别忘了
This kind of thing does happen at this point.
There's only one winner, right?

531
00:51:27,627 --> 00:51:29,712
巧克力草莓还没上来呢
We should have some
chocolate-covered strawberries.

532
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,631
- 噢，我喜欢吃
- 能不能行了
- Oh, my, yes.
- Please.

533
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:38,179
女士们，先生们，欢迎我们的节目主持人
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
your master of ceremonies,</i>

534
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:40,973
凯撒·弗里克曼
<i>Caesar Flickerman!</i>

535
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:47,521
谢谢大家！谢谢！
<i>Thank you! Thank you!</i>

536
00:51:49,065 --> 00:51:54,946
欢迎，欢迎观看第74届年度饥饿游戏大赛！
<i>Welcome, welcome, welcome
to the 74th Annual Hunger Games!</i>

537
00:51:56,155 --> 00:52:00,284
大约5分钟后，他们所有人都将到舞台上来
<i>Now, in about five minutes,
they're all going to be out here.</i>

538
00:52:00,368 --> 00:52:02,954
所有你们了解的选手们齐聚一堂
<i>All of the Tributes that you've heard about.</i>

539
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:04,413
激动吗？
<i>Are you excited?</i>

540
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:06,874
我听不见！
<i>Let me hear it!</i>

541
00:52:10,211 --> 00:52:11,462
太棒了
Amazing.

542
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:14,674
我并不觉得怎么样
I don't feel amazing.

543
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:16,676
难道你不觉得自己很漂亮吗？
Don't you know how beautiful you look?

544
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:18,594
不觉得，我也不知道怎么才能让别人喜欢上我
No. And I don't know
how to make people like me.

545
00:52:18,678 --> 00:52:21,264
- 你怎么讨别人喜欢的？
- 你已经让我喜欢上你了
- How do you make people like you?
- Well, you made me like you.

546
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:22,640
这不一样，我还不够好
That's different. I wasn't trying.

547
00:52:22,723 --> 00:52:26,727
就是这样，做自己就行，我会一直在那
Exactly. Just be yourself,
I'll be there the whole time.

548
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:30,356
你只要假装和我说话就行，好吗？
And just pretend
that you're talking to me. Okay?

549
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:31,691
好吧
Okay.

550
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:33,776
让我们瞧瞧她是否真的光芒闪耀
<i>Let's see if she does indeed shine.</i>

551
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:37,280
掌声欢迎格里姆！
<i>Let's have a warm round of applause
for Glimmer!</i>

552
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:43,494
格里姆，准备好了吗？
<i>Glimmer, are you prepared?</i>

553
00:52:43,703 --> 00:52:45,830
当然，凯撒，早就准备好了
<i>Yes, Caesar, I am very prepared.</i>

554
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:48,666
我喜欢，你很自信
<i>I like it. That's assurance.
That's self-assurance.</i>

555
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:49,959
- 难道你不觉得吗？
- 就像你看到的一样…
<i>- Don't you think?
- And, as you can see...</i>

556
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:51,836
我穿的是我们自己设计的服装
<i>...I'm wearing one of our own creations.</i>

557
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:54,714
请报以热烈掌声！
<i>A big round of applause!</i>

558
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:58,551
漫威！
Marvel!

559
00:53:01,721 --> 00:53:03,180
欢迎，克劳芙
<i>Welcome, Clove.</i>

560
00:53:03,264 --> 00:53:05,141
- 很荣幸代表我的区域参赛
- 你是个斗士
- It's an honor representing my district.
- You're a fighter.

561
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:07,643
我准备好了，我可不友善，随时出发
I'm prepared. I'm vicious. I'm ready to go.

562
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:10,062
卡托！
Cato!

563
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:13,649
我发现如果自己能够接受现在的情况
I find that if I can apply myself
to the situation present,

564
00:53:13,733 --> 00:53:15,026
我一定会有办法获胜的
I will be able to figure it out.

565
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:18,571
谢谢，很高兴见到你
非常感谢
<i>Thank you. Lovely to see you.
Thank you so much.</i>

566
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,492
你会爬树
<i>Good. So you can climb trees.</i>

567
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:25,953
动作很敏捷，你是猎人么？
You're pretty quick. And are you a hunter?

568
00:53:26,162 --> 00:53:27,621
还是收集果实的？
<i>A gatherer?</i>

569
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,506
从第12区来的，第12区…
<i>From District 12, District 12...</i>

570
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:40,760
被大家所熟知的燃烧女孩！
<i>You know her as The Girl on Fire!</i>

571
00:53:43,596 --> 00:53:46,682
我们称她为可爱的凯特尼斯·埃弗丁
<i>Well, we know her
as the lovely Katniss Everdeen!</i>

572
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:04,950
欢迎！欢迎！
<i>Welcome! Welcome.</i>

573
00:54:07,536 --> 00:54:08,788
欢迎！
<i>Welcome.</i>

574
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:13,125
那天你的入场很特别
<i>Well, that was quite an entrance
you made the other day.</i>

575
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:17,296
你说什么？
What?

576
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:21,092
我想某人有点紧张
I think someone's a little nervous.

577
00:54:22,927 --> 00:54:25,763
我是说在不久前贡品巡游那天
I said that was quite an entrance
that you made

578
00:54:25,846 --> 00:54:27,598
你的入场方式很特别
at the Tribute Parade the other day.

579
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:29,850
想和我们谈谈这个吗？
Do you want to tell us about it?

580
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:34,230
好，我只是希望别被烧死了
Well, I was just hoping that
I wouldn't burn to death.

581
00:54:42,738 --> 00:54:44,240
当你从战车上下来的时候
When you came out of that chariot,

582
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:47,827
不得不说，我的心脏都停止跳动了
I have to say, my heart stopped.

583
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:50,830
你们也有类似的感觉吧？
Did any of you experience this as well?

584
00:54:50,913 --> 00:54:52,331
心跳停止了
My heart stopped.

585
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:56,710
我也一样
So did mine.

586
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:01,799
和我说说那火焰吧，是真的吗？
Now, tell me about the flames. Are they real?

587
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:03,008
是的
Yes.

588
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:11,475
事实上今天我也带来了，你们想看吗？
In fact, I'm wearing them today.
Would you like to see?

589
00:55:12,685 --> 00:55:15,312
等一下，这安全吗？
Wait, wait, wait. Is it safe?

590
00:55:15,396 --> 00:55:16,689
当然
Yes.

591
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:18,357
观众们，你们是怎么想的？
What do you think, folks?

592
00:55:20,276 --> 00:55:21,318
我想一定会同意
I think that's a yes.

593
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:50,556
淡定，淡定
Steady. Steady.

594
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:53,058
太好看了，谢谢
Lovely. Thank you.

595
00:55:55,478 --> 00:55:58,689
真了不起，凯特尼斯，太了不起了
That was really something.
Katniss, that was something.

596
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:01,150
了不起，谢谢你的表演
That was something. Thank you for that.

597
00:56:03,402 --> 00:56:05,779
还有一个问题
I have one more question for you.

598
00:56:07,323 --> 00:56:08,782
关于你的妹妹
It's about your sister.

599
00:56:11,494 --> 00:56:17,583
当你在抽签日那天作为自愿者替她参赛的时候
我们都很感动
We were all very moved, I think, when
you volunteered for her at the Reaping.

600
00:56:19,752 --> 00:56:22,296
她和你告别了吗？
Did she come and say goodbye to you?

601
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,422
是的
Yes.

602
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:25,549
- 告别了
- 好的
- She did.
- She did.

603
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:31,430
最后你跟她说什么了？
And what did you say to her in the end?

604
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:36,936
我告诉她会尽全力赢得比赛
I told her that I would try to win.

605
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:40,773
为了她
That I would try to win for her.

606
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:43,275
当然
Of course you did.

607
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,737
你会尽力的
And try you will.

608
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:50,533
女士们，先生们，来自第12区的
Ladies and gentlemen, from District 12,

609
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:54,119
凯特尼斯·埃弗丁，燃烧女孩！
Katniss Everdeen, The Girl on Fire!

610
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,545
你做到了，亲爱的，不可思议
You did it, darling. That was incredible.

611
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:04,046
谢谢
Thank you.

612
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,590
干得漂亮，宝贝
Nice job, sweetheart.

613
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:08,634
谢谢
Thank you.

614
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:10,302
衣服不错
Nice dress, too.

615
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:15,015
- 没说你
- 请大家欢迎皮塔·莫拉克
<i>- Not yours.
- Please welcome Peeta Mellark!</i>

616
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,190
皮塔，欢迎
<i>Peeta, welcome.</i>

617
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:27,403
你怎么找到凯匹特的？别跟我说“看地图找的”
<i>How are you finding The Capitol?
And don't say, "With a map. "</i>

618
00:57:27,486 --> 00:57:30,114
当然不是，这里和家不一样
<i>It's different.
It's very different than back home.</i>

619
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:33,075
不一样，你指哪方面？举个例子
<i>Different. In what way? Give us an example.</i>

620
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:35,494
好的，淋浴感觉挺古怪的
<i>Okay. Well, the showers here are weird.</i>

621
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:36,996
- 淋浴？
- 是的
- The showers?
- Yes.

622
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:38,664
咱们的淋浴不一样
We have different showers.

623
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:42,751
有个问题想问你，凯撒
你闻我身上有玫瑰的味道嘛？
I have a question for you, Caesar.
Do I smell like roses to you?

624
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,672
- 再近一点
- 好
- Take a whiff?
- All right.

625
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:50,217
- 闻到了吗？
- 嗯，我闻起来有玫瑰的味道嘛？
- You see?
- Yes. Do I smell like it?

626
00:57:57,057 --> 00:57:59,560
- 你的闻起来一定比我强
- 那是，我在这呆的比你久
- You definitely smell better than I do.
- Well, I've lived here longer.

627
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:00,811
有道理
That makes sense.

628
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,943
真有趣，皮塔，和我说说
Very funny. So, Peeta, tell me,

629
00:58:09,028 --> 00:58:11,614
在家有没有对你来讲意义特殊的女孩子？
is there a special girl back home?

630
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:13,324
没，没有，算不上
No. No. Not really.

631
00:58:13,574 --> 00:58:17,620
没有？我一点也不信，看看这张脸
No? I don't believe it for a second.
Look at that face.

632
00:58:17,703 --> 00:58:21,665
像你这么帅的小伙子，皮塔，招了吧
Handsome man like you. Peeta, tell me.

633
00:58:24,043 --> 00:58:25,544
额，有…
Well, there...

634
00:58:26,045 --> 00:58:29,381
我一直迷恋着一个女孩
There is this one girl
that I've had a crush on forever.

635
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:34,595
但实际上我并不认为她能认识我，直到抽签日那天
But I don't think she actually recognized me
until the Reaping.

636
00:58:37,056 --> 00:58:39,224
我来告诉你吧，皮塔
Well, I'll tell you what, Peeta.

637
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:44,188
从竞技场走出去你就会赢得想要的东西
You go out there and you win this thing,

638
00:58:44,647 --> 00:58:47,900
当你回家的时候，他一定会和你在一起的
and when you get home,
she'll have to go out with you.

639
00:58:48,484 --> 00:58:49,610
对吗？朋友们
Right, folks?

640
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:56,492
谢谢，但我并不觉得获胜能帮什么忙
Thanks, but I don't think winning's
gonna help me at all.

641
00:58:56,575 --> 00:58:57,951
怎么呢？
And why not?

642
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:03,749
因为她和我都在这
Because she came here with me.

643
00:59:08,003 --> 00:59:09,588
真不走运
<i>Well, that's bad luck.</i>

644
00:59:10,089 --> 00:59:11,548
的确是这样
<i>Yeah, it is.</i>

645
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:16,595
- 祝你一切顺利
- 谢谢
<i>- And I wish you all the best of luck.
- Thank you.</i>

646
00:59:17,513 --> 00:59:19,056
皮塔·莫拉克
<i>Peeta Mellark.</i>

647
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:21,725
来自第12区！
<i>District 12!</i>

648
00:59:25,104 --> 00:59:26,772
刚才是怎么回事？
What the hell was that?

649
00:59:26,855 --> 00:59:28,857
之前你不和我说话，现在你又说喜欢我？
You don't talk to me,
and then you say you have a crush on me?

650
00:59:28,941 --> 00:59:31,026
你说你想独立训练，这是你想做的吗？
You say you want to train alone?
Is that how you want to play?

651
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:32,736
住手！住手！
Stop it! Stop it!

652
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:33,987
- 咱俩把话说清楚！
- 嘿！
- Let's start right now!
- Hey!

653
00:59:35,948 --> 00:59:38,117
- 他在帮你
- 他让我看起来很脆弱
- He did you a favor.
- He made me look weak.

654
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:42,037
他使你看起来令人满意
像你这种情况，不能伤心，宝贝
He made you look desirable,
which in your case, can't hurt, sweetheart.

655
00:59:42,121 --> 00:59:43,163
他说的对，凯特尼斯
He's right, Katniss.

656
00:59:43,247 --> 00:59:44,456
当然没错
Of course I'm right.

657
00:59:44,707 --> 00:59:47,960
我可以出卖你们这对倒霉情侣
Now, I can sell the star-crossed lovers
from District 12...

658
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:49,545
我俩不是情侣
We are not star-crossed lovers.

659
00:59:49,628 --> 00:59:51,380
这是电视节目！
It's a television show!

660
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:55,217
和他相爱也许会得到赞助商的青睐
And being in love with that boy
might just get you sponsors,

661
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,636
这样才能让你们保命
which could save your damn life.

662
00:59:58,887 --> 01:00:01,598
好吧，你还在这干什么？
Okay. Why don't you get out of here?

663
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:05,310
也许明天我能拯救你们两个
Maybe I can deliver you both
in one piece tomorrow.

664
01:00:05,394 --> 01:00:06,812
礼貌点！
Manners!

665
01:00:37,885 --> 01:00:39,178
你也没睡？
You, too?

666
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:42,347
嘿
Hey.

667
01:00:42,765 --> 01:00:43,932
睡不着吗？
Can't sleep?

668
01:00:44,016 --> 01:00:45,726
是啊，睡不着。
No. Of course not.

669
01:00:48,312 --> 01:00:50,397
对于你的追求我很抱歉
I'm sorry I went after you.

670
01:00:53,025 --> 01:00:55,360
你知道的，那只是在恭维你
You know, I meant that as a compliment.

671
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:57,070
我懂
I know.

672
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:09,958
听他们的话吧
Listen to them.

673
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:13,003
嗯
Yeah.

674
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:19,885
我只是不想让他们改变我
I just don't want them to change me.

675
01:01:22,805 --> 01:01:24,515
他们怎么改变你了？
How would they change you?

676
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:31,188
不知道，他们使我变得有点不像我了
I don't know.
They'd turn me into something I'm not.

677
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:36,443
我只是不想在游戏里变成另外一个人，你懂吗？
I just don't want to be
another piece in their game, you know?

678
01:01:38,529 --> 01:01:39,988
你的意思是不杀任何人？
You mean you won't kill anyone?

679
01:01:42,324 --> 01:01:43,325
不
No.

680
01:01:44,076 --> 01:01:46,829
我是说我确定不会杀人的，和其他人一样
I mean, I'm sure I would,
just like anybody else

681
01:01:46,912 --> 01:01:47,996
当比赛开始时
when the time came,

682
01:01:49,498 --> 01:01:53,418
我仍希望可以通过一种方式来向他们传达
but I just keep wishing
that I could think of a way to show them

683
01:01:53,502 --> 01:01:55,254
我并不属于他们
that they don't own me.

684
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:02,970
即使我要死了，我也要做我自己
If I'm gonna die, I want to still be me.

685
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,519
你觉得有道理吗？
Does that make any sense?

686
01:02:10,602 --> 01:02:11,728
是啊
Yeah.

687
01:02:13,981 --> 01:02:16,191
只是我还没想过这些
I just can't afford to think like that.

688
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:22,406
我还有妹妹
I have my sister.

689
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:25,951
我知道
Yeah, I know.

690
01:02:40,674 --> 01:02:42,926
咱们明天见吧
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

691
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:47,389
明天见
See you tomorrow.

692
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:17,502
他们会把所有物品放在丰饶角前面的开口处
（注：丰饶角，位于比赛起点的建筑，四周放有生存物资。）
They'll put all kinds of stuff right in front,
right in the mouth of the Cornucopia.

693
01:03:17,586 --> 01:03:20,339
在那还有一把弓箭，你别去拿它
There'll even be a bow there. Don't go for it.

694
01:03:20,422 --> 01:03:21,673
为什么不能拿？
Why not?

695
01:03:21,757 --> 01:03:23,967
游戏刚开始会有一场大屠杀
你会被卷进去的
It's a bloodbath.
They're trying to pull you in.

696
01:03:24,051 --> 01:03:25,469
这不是你一个人的游戏
That's not your game.

697
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:29,514
你要转身快跑，找个高地，寻找水源
You turn, run, find high ground,
look for water.

698
01:03:29,598 --> 01:03:31,808
水是你最好的新朋友
Water's your new best friend.

699
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:36,605
别提前走基座上走下来，他们会把你吹上天的
Don't step off that pedestal early
or they'll blow you sky high.

700
01:03:36,688 --> 01:03:37,940
我不会的
I won't.

701
01:03:49,993 --> 01:03:53,080
凯特尼斯，你能做到的
Katniss, you can do this.

702
01:04:01,213 --> 01:04:02,422
谢谢
Thanks.

703
01:04:07,302 --> 01:04:08,929
伸出手臂
Give me your arm.

704
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:14,434
伸出手臂
Give me your arm.

705
01:04:20,899 --> 01:04:22,734
- 伸出手臂
- 这是什么？
- Give me your arm.
- What is that?

706
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:26,989
追踪器
Your tracker.

707
01:04:28,532 --> 01:04:29,533
准备就绪
We're up.

708
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:31,118
准备就绪
We're up!

709
01:04:33,245 --> 01:04:37,499
好的，还有不到一分钟，伙计们
最后检查一遍
All right. Less than a minute, people.
Final checks.

710
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:39,918
还有15秒，准备起飞
There are 15 out. They are flying.

711
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:18,790
这
Here.

712
01:05:39,102 --> 01:05:40,437
谢谢
Thank you.

713
01:05:49,029 --> 01:05:50,530
30秒
<i>Thirty seconds.</i>

714
01:05:57,996 --> 01:06:02,000
我被禁止赌博
如果我可以下个赌注的话，一定赌你赢
I'm not allowed to bet,
but if I could, I'd bet on you.

715
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:15,305
20秒
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

716
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:29,444
10秒
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

717
01:06:55,303 --> 01:06:57,597
好的，他们进管道了
Okay, they're in the tubes.

718
01:07:37,888 --> 01:07:41,933
50, 49, 48, 47,

719
01:07:42,017 --> 01:07:46,354
46, 45, 44, 43,

720
01:07:46,438 --> 01:07:49,858
42, 41, 40,
42, 41, 40,

721
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:53,862
<i>39, 38, 37, 36,</i>

722
01:07:53,945 --> 01:07:58,158
<i>35, 34, 33, 32,</i>

723
01:07:58,617 --> 01:08:02,579
<i>31, 30, 29, 28,</i>

724
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:06,041
<i>27, 26, 25,</i>

725
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:09,169
<i>24, 23, 22...</i>

726
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:23,530
又是一次熟悉的噩耗
And, of course,
there's the familiar "boom" of the cannon,

727
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:26,658
屏幕上标记的是挑战失败的贡品
which marks the end
of another fallen Tribute.

728
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:28,451
8
...eight...


729
01:11:29,536 --> 01:11:30,537
9
...nine...


730
01:11:31,996 --> 01:11:32,997
10
...10...


731
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:35,208
11
...11...


732
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:38,044
12
...12.


733
01:13:20,605 --> 01:13:21,606
25？收到
Twenty-five? Got it.

734
01:13:26,361 --> 01:13:27,362
他在移动
He's moving now.

735
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:03,207
在第一个8小时内有13名选手挑战失败
Well, that makes 13 gone
in the first eight hours.

736
01:15:03,374 --> 01:15:06,669
克劳迪亚斯，我想我看到一个正在逐步形成联盟
And Claudius,
I think I see an alliance forming.

737
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:13,843
等下！你看到她的表情了吗？
Wait! Did you see the look on her face?

738
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:15,803
- 你怎么知道她在那？
- 看到火光了吗？
- How stupid can you get?
- A fire?

739
01:15:15,887 --> 01:15:19,349
“不！求求你，别杀我！不！”
"Oh, no! Please don't kill me! Oh, no!"

740
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:21,768
真令人印象深刻
That's actually a good impression.

741
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:23,269
嘿，小白脸！
Hey, lover boy!

742
01:15:24,771 --> 01:15:27,190
- 你确定她走的是这条路吗？
- 我确定
- You sure she went this way?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

743
01:15:28,232 --> 01:15:29,484
最好没错
You better be.

744
01:15:29,567 --> 01:15:32,528
那是她布置的陷阱，我在那后面找到的
Yeah, that was her snare
we found back there.

745
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:40,495
我们现在怎么不把他干掉呢？
Are you sure we shouldn't just kill him now?

746
01:15:40,578 --> 01:15:42,413
算了，有他在我们才能找到那女孩
Nah. He's our best chance of finding her.

747
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:44,874
走吧
Let's go.

748
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,145
先生？
Sir?

749
01:16:08,231 --> 01:16:10,441
她一直在竞技场的边缘徘徊
She is almost at the edge.

750
01:16:10,525 --> 01:16:13,111
离她最近的贡品也有2公里远
<i>Two kilometers away
from the nearest Tribute.</i>

751
01:16:13,194 --> 01:16:14,529
咱们得让她掉头
<i>Let's turn her around.</i>

752
01:17:15,214 --> 01:17:18,259
另一个准备，开始计时，1，2
Cueing another. On my count. One, two...

753
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:32,273
她往左侧去了
She's heading towards the left flank.

754
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:34,692
好的，能在那放棵树吗？
Okay. Can you give me a tree right there?

755
01:17:34,776 --> 01:17:37,403
可以，准备放树
Sure. Cueing tree.

756
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:30,790
她在那
She's almost there.

757
01:18:44,303 --> 01:18:46,639
露西娅，准备加农炮
Lucia, get a cannon ready.

758
01:18:58,693 --> 01:19:00,194
在那！她在那！
There she is! There she is!

759
01:19:02,947 --> 01:19:05,449
- 她是我的！
- 先到先得！
- She's mine!
- Not if I get her first!

760
01:19:09,996 --> 01:19:12,123
- 你往哪跑？
- 她是我的！
- Where you gonna go?
- Mine!

761
01:19:12,206 --> 01:19:14,750
把池塘翻个遍，一定要找到她
Fish out of the pond!
And someone found her.

762
01:19:21,132 --> 01:19:23,134
- 她在那！
- 耶！
- There she is!
- Yeah!

763
01:19:28,139 --> 01:19:29,599
我们来啦！
Here we go!

764
01:19:35,438 --> 01:19:37,815
- 往哪跑？
- 抓住他，卡托！
- Where you going, huh?
- Get her, Cato!

765
01:19:38,024 --> 01:19:39,483
你以为能跑哪去？
Where do you think you're going?

766
01:19:42,528 --> 01:19:44,405
往哪跑，宝贝
Where you going, baby?

767
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:46,908
3点钟方向
Three o'clock.

768
01:19:49,452 --> 01:19:51,537
- 你去哪，燃烧女孩？
- 我们抓到她了！
- Where you going, Girl on Fire?
- We got her!

769
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:53,164
埃弗丁小姐，我会抓住你的！
Miss Everdeen, I'm gonna get you!

770
01:19:53,247 --> 01:19:54,582
爬那么高无济于事的，凯特尼斯
That's not gonna help you up there, Katniss.

771
01:19:54,665 --> 01:19:56,375
你想往哪去啊？
Where are you going?

772
01:19:56,667 --> 01:19:59,211
- 去抓她！
- 你能行的
- Go get her, man!
- You are so done.

773
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:01,297
卡托，上！
Just get her, Cato!

774
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:02,381
- 他来抓你了，凯特尼斯
- 看把她急的
- He's gonna get you, Katniss.
- Look at her scurry.

775
01:20:03,382 --> 01:20:04,383
快逮到她了
Right up there.

776
01:20:05,259 --> 01:20:06,969
- 杀了她！
- 继续爬啊
- Kill her!
- Just go, keep going!

777
01:20:08,095 --> 01:20:09,847
加油，卡托
- Go, Cato.
- Come on, Cato.

778
01:20:09,931 --> 01:20:10,932
- 她就在那了
- 卡托！加油！卡托！
- She's right there.
- Go, Cato! Come on, Cato!

779
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:12,058
快到了
You got this.

780
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:13,100
爬啊！
Go! He's got this.

781
01:20:13,184 --> 01:20:15,686
- 杀了她，卡托！抓住她，卡托！
- 上啊！
- Kill her, Cato! Just get her, Cato!
- Go! Go!

782
01:20:15,770 --> 01:20:17,313
- 把她弄下来！
- 快爬啊！
- Take her down!
- Go! Go!

783
01:20:17,939 --> 01:20:19,273
- 就快到了，卡托！
- 加油，杀了她！
- You got this, Cato!
- Come on, kill her!

784
01:20:19,357 --> 01:20:20,775
我来取你小命了！
I'm coming for you!

785
01:20:20,858 --> 01:20:22,318
加油，卡托！
Come on, Cato!

786
01:20:26,489 --> 01:20:28,157
我自己来
I'll do it myself.

787
01:20:35,289 --> 01:20:36,791
让我来
Give me that before...

788
01:20:36,874 --> 01:20:38,918
- 把她射下来
- 加油，射啊！
- Get her.
- Come on. Come on, come on!

789
01:20:41,671 --> 01:20:44,048
你们应该把刀扔上来试试！
Maybe you should throw the sword!

790
01:20:44,507 --> 01:20:46,425
我们等她下来吧
Let's just wait her out.

791
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:52,598
过段时间她会下来的，否则就得饿死
She's gotta come down at some point.
It's that or starve to death.

792
01:20:52,682 --> 01:20:53,891
然后我们再找她算账
We'll just kill her then.

793
01:20:58,062 --> 01:20:59,230
好的
Okay.

794
01:21:00,231 --> 01:21:01,732
谁去生把火
Somebody make a fire.

795
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:16,247
- 我们就在这露营
- 快去生把火
- Let's make camp over here!
- Hurry up with the fire.

796
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:15,639
小孩子
Boys.

谢谢

01:25:05,142 --> 01:25:08,646
克劳迪亚斯，我想那些是杀人蜂，没错吧？
Claudius, I think those are tracker jackers
Am I wrong?

801
01:25:11,232 --> 01:25:14,026
- 它们相当有杀伤力
- 很致命
- Those things are very lethal.
- Very.

802
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:15,194
对于不了解的朋友，我再介绍一下
For those of you who don't know,

803
01:25:15,277 --> 01:25:20,532
杀人蜂是经过基因改良过的黄蜂
毒液可以引起灼热似的疼痛
tracker jackers are genetically engineered
wasps whose venom causes searing pain,

804
01:25:20,991 --> 01:25:26,163
强劲的幻觉，在极端情况下甚至可以导致死亡
<i>powerful hallucinations,
and in extreme cases, death.</i>

805
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:26,135
跑！
Run!

806
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:28,262
跑！
Run!

807
01:28:29,513 --> 01:28:30,681
快跑啊！
Run!

808
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:33,100
凯特尼斯，快跑！
Katniss, go!

809
01:28:33,934 --> 01:28:36,687
离开这，快走！
你在想什么，快走！
Get out of here! Go!
What are you doing? Go!

810
01:28:48,407 --> 01:28:52,995
不但极具杀伤力，而且只需一只杀人蜂的毒液
Not only is it lethal,
but the venom of a tracker jacker sting

811
01:28:54,037 --> 01:28:55,914
也能令人产生强劲的幻觉
can produce powerful hallucinations.

812
01:29:56,433 --> 01:30:00,729
妈妈，别只是坐在那看我！
说点什么吧！
Mom, don't just sit there and look at me!
Please say something!

813
01:30:01,313 --> 01:30:03,065
凯特尼斯，快跑！
Katniss, go!

814
01:30:04,525 --> 01:30:07,277
离开这，快走！
你在想什么，快走！
Get out of here! Go!
What are you doing? Go!

815
01:31:08,171 --> 01:31:09,256
茹？
Rue?

816
01:31:12,968 --> 01:31:15,387
没事，我不会伤害你的
It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you.

817
01:31:33,030 --> 01:31:34,531
我的也给你吧？
You want mine, too?

818
01:31:35,574 --> 01:31:37,200
不用了
No, that's okay.

819
01:31:38,285 --> 01:31:39,369
给
Here.

820
01:31:40,329 --> 01:31:41,496
谢谢
Thanks.

821
01:31:46,543 --> 01:31:48,170
我昏迷多久了？
How long was I asleep?

822
01:31:48,962 --> 01:31:52,174
好几天了，我帮你换了两次树叶
Couple of days. I changed your leaves twice.

823
01:31:54,384 --> 01:31:55,719
谢谢
Thank you.

824
01:31:57,429 --> 01:31:59,765
我昏迷这几天都发生什么了？
So what happened while I was out?

825
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:03,101
第1区的女孩和第10区的男孩
The girl from 1 and the boy from 10.

826
01:32:07,147 --> 01:32:09,399
和我一起来的男孩呢？
And the boy from my district?

827
01:32:10,317 --> 01:32:13,528
他没事，我想他沿着河边往下游走了
Yeah, he's okay.
I think he's down by the river.

828
01:32:16,907 --> 01:32:18,617
那些都是真的吗？
Is all of that true?

829
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:19,785
什么？
What?

830
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:21,870
你们俩？
You and him?

831
01:32:23,455 --> 01:32:25,457
卡托和其他人在哪？
So where are Cato and the others?

832
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:28,585
他们把所有补给品放在河边
They got all their supplies
down by the lake.

833
01:32:28,669 --> 01:32:30,837
堆成很大的锥型
<i>It's piled up in this great big pyramid.</i>

834
01:32:31,421 --> 01:32:33,256
听起来很诱人
That sounds tempting.

835
01:32:49,106 --> 01:32:51,149
这些树枝可以很快的燃烧起来
Now, this green stuff
is gonna smoke like crazy,

836
01:32:51,233 --> 01:32:53,944
一旦你点燃它了，就接着去点燃下一堆
so as soon as you light it,
move on to the next fire.

837
01:32:54,027 --> 01:32:56,530
点燃最后这堆后，我会在那跟你会合
Light this one last,
and I'll meet you back over there.

838
01:32:56,613 --> 01:32:57,823
好的
Right.

839
01:33:01,118 --> 01:33:04,204
然后当他们去抓我们的时候，我会摧毁他们的补给品
And then I'll destroy their stuff
while they're chasing us.

840
01:33:04,287 --> 01:33:06,540
一旦我们当中的一个被抓了，需要一个暗号
We need a signal
in case one of us gets held up.

841
01:33:06,623 --> 01:33:07,791
好，什么暗号？
Okay. Like what?

842
01:33:10,085 --> 01:33:11,753
看着
Here. Watch this.

843
01:33:17,467 --> 01:33:20,387
学舌鸟，太棒了
Mockingjays. That's great.

844
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:23,390
在家的时候，我们一直用它们做暗号
Back home,
we use them to signal all the time.

845
01:33:28,311 --> 01:33:29,521
你来试试
You try.

846
01:33:38,989 --> 01:33:40,699
很好，一旦我们听见这声音
Okay, so if we hear that,

847
01:33:40,782 --> 01:33:44,286
就表示我俩都没事，很快便会再见面的
it means we're okay
and we'll be back real soon.

848
01:33:44,369 --> 01:33:45,620
我们会没事的
We're gonna be okay.

849
01:33:51,543 --> 01:33:54,504
晚餐见
Hey, I'll see you for supper.

850
01:33:56,006 --> 01:33:57,966
- 好的
- 好的
-Okay-
-Okay-

851
01:34:26,328 --> 01:34:29,706
伙计们，看呐！这呢
过来，看这边！
Guys. Guys, look! Over here.
Come on, come on. Look!

852
01:34:33,877 --> 01:34:34,920
我们走
Let's go.

853
01:34:35,337 --> 01:34:38,089
你要保持警惕在我们回来之前别离开
You stay guard and don't move
until we can get back.

854
01:35:06,827 --> 01:35:09,955
我倒想看看她能否搞定这个陷阱
I want to see if she's gonna figure out
this booby trap.

855
01:35:10,247 --> 01:35:12,541
是啊，看起来这一大堆好吃的旁边
Yes. It seems they've reburied their mines

856
01:35:12,624 --> 01:35:15,210
埋了不少地雷
<i>around that big pile of goodies.</i>

857
01:35:27,430 --> 01:35:30,350
她一定能搞定的，不是么？
<i>She's certainly figured it out, hasn't she?</i>

858
01:37:38,186 --> 01:37:40,313
我不知道发生了什么
I don't know what happened.

859
01:37:40,397 --> 01:37:43,024
- 究竟是怎么回事？
- 我不知道
- What the hell happened?
- I don't know!

860
01:37:43,566 --> 01:37:44,567
补给品全毁了！
Our stuff!

861
01:38:41,458 --> 01:38:42,667

865
01:38:56,556 --> 01:38:58,933

01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:01,352

867
01:39:02,479 --> 01:39:03,688
凯特尼斯！
Katniss!

868
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:05,648
没事了
It's okay. It's okay.

869
01:39:14,866 --> 01:39:18,244
没事的，你很好，明白吗？
You're okay. You're okay. You're fine. See?

870
01:39:47,357 --> 01:39:49,484
会好起来的
It's okay. You're okay.

871
01:39:49,859 --> 01:39:52,445
一切都会好的
You're okay. You're okay.

872
01:40:00,036 --> 01:40:02,038
你把他们的食物毁掉了吗？
Did you blow up the food?

873
01:40:04,666 --> 01:40:06,209
片甲不留
Every bit of it.

874
01:40:09,546 --> 01:40:10,713
太好了
Good.

875
01:40:12,757 --> 01:40:14,634
你赢定了
You have to win.

876
01:40:23,893 --> 01:40:25,562
你能唱歌给我听吗？
Can you sing?

877
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:30,567
好的
Okay.

软软的绿枕头
<i>A soft green pillow</i>

882
01:40:55,258 --> 01:40:58,052
把头放上去
<i>Lay down your head</i>

883
01:40:58,761 --> 01:41:02,056
闭上你的眼
<i>and close your eyes</i>

884
01:41:02,932 --> 01:41:07,937
当你睁开眼，阳光……
<i>And when they open, the sun...</i>

885
01:41:56,778 --> 01:41:57,779
对不起
I'm sorry.

886
01:41:59,989 --> 01:42:01,491
对不起
I'm sorry.

别杀她，这样只能多一个牺牲者而已
<i>Don't kill her. You'll just create a martyr.</i>

889
01:45:00,294 --> 01:45:01,587
看起来我们已经有一个了
Well, it seems we've already got one.

890
01:45:01,671 --> 01:45:04,966
关于11区的传言我也听说了
如果按我说的做可以避免把你卷入是非
I hear these rumors out of District 11.
This could get away from you.

891
01:45:05,049 --> 01:45:06,217
你想怎么样？
What do you want?

892
01:45:07,093 --> 01:45:08,719
那有很多愤怒的群众
You have a lot of anger out there.

893
01:45:08,803 --> 01:45:11,848
我想你应该知道如何处理这帮暴徒
之前你也经历过
I know you know how to handle a mob.
You've done it before.

894
01:45:11,931 --> 01:45:16,769
如果你不能吓跑他们，就支持他们吧
If you can't scare them,
give them something to root for.

895
01:45:17,812 --> 01:45:18,813
比如？
Such as?

浪漫的爱情
Young love.

你怎么像个穷鬼一样？
So you like an underdog?

898
01:45:27,029 --> 01:45:28,322
大家都喜欢穷鬼
Everyone likes an underdog.

899
01:45:28,406 --> 01:45:29,657
我不喜欢
I don't.

900
01:45:31,367 --> 01:45:34,454
你去过那吗？10区？11区？12区？
Have you been out there? 10? 11? 12?

901
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:37,915
没去过
Not personally. No.

902
01:45:37,999 --> 01:45:39,417
我去过
Well, I have.

903
01:45:40,585 --> 01:45:42,545
那有很多穷人
There are lots of underdogs.

904

煤也不少
Lots of coal, too.

905
01:45:44,630 --> 01:45:47,967
农作物，矿产，都是我们需要的东西
Grow crops, minerals, things we need.

906
01:45:49,802 --> 01:45:52,054
穷人很多
There are lots of underdogs.

907
01:45:53,055 --> 01:45:55,016
我想如果你看到他们
And I think if you could see them,

908
01:45:56,392 --> 01:45:58,895
就不会支持他们了
you would not root for them either.

909
01:46:01,355 --> 01:46:02,732
我欣赏你
I like you.

910
01:46:06,068 --> 01:46:07,653
当心点
Be careful.

01:46:20,666 --> 01:46:25,505
只有1名获胜者的比赛规则暂定废除
<i>The regulations requiring a single victor
have been suspended.</i>

913
01:46:25,588 --> 01:46:27,924
从现在起，允许有两名胜者
<i>From now on, two victors may be crowned,</i>

914
01:46:28,007 --> 01:46:31,677
只要两人来自于同一区
<i>if both originate from the same district.</i>

915
01:46:31,761 --> 01:46:34,222
仅此通告
<i>This will be the only announcement.</i>

916
01:46:35,598 --> 01:46:36,891
皮塔
Peeta.

917
01:47:37,827 --> 01:47:40,329
天呐！皮塔！皮塔！
Oh, my God! Peeta! Peeta!

918
01:47:43,416 --> 01:47:44,417
嗨
Hi.

919
01:47:48,212 --> 01:47:49,672
没事了
It's okay.

920
01:48:04,687 --> 01:48:06,105
怎么弄的？
What was it?

921
01:48:06,397 --> 01:48:07,690
刀伤
A sword.

922
01:48:09,317 --> 01:48:10,860
糟透了，不是么？
It's bad, huh?

923
01:48:11,986 --> 01:48:13,696
会好起来的
It's gonna be fine.

924
01:48:26,375 --> 01:48:27,835
凯特尼斯
Katniss.

925
01:48:31,505 --> 01:48:32,965
- 凯特尼斯
- 不！
- Katniss.
- No!

926
01:48:34,300 --> 01:48:38,095
我不会离开你
再也不会那么做了
I'm not gonna leave you.
I'm not gonna do that.

927
01:48:45,686 --> 01:48:47,104
为什么？
Why not?

928
01:49:07,333 --> 01:49:09,919
在这没人会找到你
Nobody's gonna find you in here.

929
01:49:10,002 --> 01:49:11,962
他们已经发现我一次了
They already found me.

930
01:49:16,092 --> 01:49:17,968
我们会给你弄些药
We'll just get you some medicine.

931
01:49:18,052 --> 01:49:19,887
凯特尼斯，我没弄到多少降落伞补给
Katniss, I don't get many parachutes.

932
01:49:20,846 --> 01:49:22,098
我们会有办法的
We'll figure something out.

933
01:49:23,182 --> 01:49:24,517
比如说？
Like what?

934
01:49:25,559 --> 01:49:26,936
会有的
Something.

935
01:50:17,433 --> 01:50:19,959
[这也算接吻吗？ -黑密斯]
[YOU CALL THAT A KISS? - H]

936
01:50:28,289 --> 01:50:30,833
- 是药吗？
- 不，是汤
- Medicine?
- No. Soup.

937
01:50:31,667 --> 01:50:32,668
我来喂你吧
I'll do it.

938
01:50:43,345 --> 01:50:44,847
味道真好
That's nice.

939
01:50:46,849 --> 01:50:48,684
曾经你有恩于我
You fed me once.

940
01:50:51,771 --> 01:50:53,689
我一直在想
I think about that all the time.

941
01:50:55,483 --> 01:50:57,401
我怎么能把面包丢给你呢
How I tossed you that bread.

942
01:50:57,485 --> 01:50:59,153
- 皮塔
- 我应该把它送给你
- Peeta...
- I should have gone to you.

943
01:50:59,236 --> 01:51:01,489
我应该冒雨走到你面前然后……
I should have just gone out in the rain and...

944
01:51:04,575 --> 01:51:06,035
你好像有点发烧
You feel hot.

945
01:51:08,662 --> 01:51:10,706
我还记得第一次见到你是什么样子
I remember the first time I saw you.

946
01:51:11,957 --> 01:51:13,876
你梳两条辫子
Your hair was in two braids instead of one.

947
01:51:15,419 --> 01:51:18,464
我还记得当你在音乐课唱歌的时候
And I remember when you sang
in the music assembly.

948
01:51:18,547 --> 01:51:20,925
老师说“谁知道山谷之歌？”
"Who knows The Valley Song?”</i>
<i>The teacher said,

949
01:51:21,008 --> 01:51:23,135
你第一个把手举起来
And your hand shot straight up.

950
01:51:23,219 --> 01:51:24,303
别说了
Stop.

951
01:51:24,553 --> 01:51:28,390
从那之后，我每天都会看着你回家
After that,
I watched you going home every day.

952
01:51:31,393 --> 01:51:32,728
每天都是
Every day-

953
01:51:40,569 --> 01:51:42,404
说点什么吧
Well, say something.

954
01:51:45,491 --> 01:51:47,910
我不擅长和别人交流
I'm not good at saying something.

955
01:51:49,829 --> 01:51:51,205
那就到这来
Then come here.

956
01:51:52,873 --> 01:51:54,083
来吧
Please.

957
01:52:06,303 --> 01:52:08,180
即使我没有…
Even if I don't make it...

958
01:52:09,098 --> 01:52:10,182
别说了
Stop it.

959
01:52:16,438 --> 01:52:18,524
贡品请注意，贡品请注意
<i>Attention, Tributes. Attention.</i>

960
01:52:19,275 --> 01:52:22,194
明天日出时分，在丰饶角
<i>Commencing at sunrise,
there will be a feast tomorrow</i>

961
01:52:22,278 --> 01:52:23,863
会有一场盛筵
<i>at the Cornucopia.</i>

962
01:52:23,946 --> 01:52:27,032
想参加的话并不轻松
<i>This will be no ordinary occasion.</i>

963
01:52:27,116 --> 01:52:30,870
你们每个人都要拿出真本事
<i>Each of you needs something desperately.</i>

964
01:52:30,953 --> 01:52:34,915
我们是很慷慨的
<i>And we plan to be generous hosts.</i>

965
01:52:34,999 --> 01:52:36,542
会有你需要的药品
Your medicine.

966
01:52:36,625 --> 01:52:37,626
你别自己去
You're not going alone.

967
01:52:37,793 --> 01:52:39,879
你需要它，你现在无法行走
Yeah? You need it, and you can't walk.

968
01:52:39,962 --> 01:52:42,715
凯特尼斯，别为了我拿自己的性命冒险，我不会让你去的
Katniss, you're not gonna risk
your life for me. I'm not gonna let you.

969
01:52:42,798 --> 01:52:45,801
如果换做是你，也会这么做，不是吗？
You would do it for me. Wouldn't you?

970
01:52:47,761 --> 01:52:49,471
为什么要这么做？
Why are you doing this?

971
01:52:53,071 --> 01:52:55,928
（注：之前的降落伞里导师的
纸条上写着“这也算是接吻吗？”）

972
01:52:56,656 --> 01:53:01,500
（这句话的意思是提醒凯特尼斯即便做秀也要做足，
要想活命，必须和皮塔在一起，）

973
01:53:02,007 --> 01:53:05,517
（于是凯特尼斯回到山洞又给了皮塔深深的一吻。）

974
01:53:07,990 --> 01:53:10,242
现在我更不可能让你去了
Now there's no way I'm letting you go.

975
01:53:10,326 --> 01:53:11,327
皮塔…
Peeta...

976
01:53:11,410 --> 01:53:12,620
求你了
Please.

977
01:53:13,537 --> 01:53:14,622
留下吧
Stay.

978
01:53:19,752 --> 01:53:20,878
好吧
Okay.

979
01:53:22,338 --> 01:53:23,672
我不走
I'll stay.

980
01:54:52,761 --> 01:54:54,096
哦，天呐！
Oh, God!

981
01:55:25,461 --> 01:55:27,129
你的男朋友呢？
Where's lover boy?

982
01:55:29,798 --> 01:55:33,635
我知道了，你是为他而来的，对不对？
I see. You were gonna help him, right?

983
01:55:34,303 --> 01:55:38,891
太感人了。你知道吗，救不了你那位小朋友
是多么糟糕的一件事
Well, that's sweet. You know, it's too bad
that you couldn't help your little friend.

984
01:55:39,475 --> 01:55:41,810
她叫什么来着？
That little girl? What was her name again?

985
01:55:42,686 --> 01:55:43,771
茹？
Rue?

986
01:55:46,398 --> 01:55:48,442
就是她，是我们杀了她
Yeah, well, we killed her.

987
01:55:49,151 --> 01:55:52,196
现在我来干掉你
And now we're gonna kill you.

988
01:55:58,160 --> 01:55:59,453
你杀了她？
You kill her?

989
01:55:59,536 --> 01:56:00,746
- 不！
- 我听见你说的了！
- No!
- I heard you!

990
01:56:00,829 --> 01:56:02,748
- 卡托！卡托！
- 你说了她的名字！
- Cato! Cato!
- You said her name!

991
01:56:02,831 --> 01:56:04,083
是你说的！
You said her name!

992
01:56:14,843 --> 01:56:16,011
就这一次
Just this time, 12.

993
01:56:17,179 --> 01:56:18,222
为了茹
For Rue.

994
01:56:34,530 --> 01:56:37,866
皮塔，我找到药了
Peeta, I got it. I got the medicine.

995
01:56:38,158 --> 01:56:39,618
- 你怎么了
- 没怎么
- What happened to you?
- I'm fine.

996
01:56:39,701 --> 01:56:41,120
不，你受伤了，发生什么了？
No, you're not. What happened?

997
01:56:41,328 --> 01:56:43,622
2区的女孩，对我丢了一把飞刀，没事的
The girl from 2, she threw a knife. I'm okay.

998
01:56:43,705 --> 01:56:45,457
你就不应该去
你说过你不会去的
You shouldn't have gone.
You said you weren't gonna go.

999
01:56:45,541 --> 01:56:47,042
你的伤好像更糟了
You got worse.

1000
01:56:51,213 --> 01:56:52,214
对不起
I'm sorry.

1001
01:56:53,757 --> 01:56:55,300
你也需要抹一点
You need some of that, too.

1002
01:56:55,634 --> 01:56:56,885
我没事
I'm okay.

1003
01:56:59,888 --> 01:57:01,557
感觉好多了
That feels better.

1004
01:57:03,183 --> 01:57:05,310
好的，该你了
Okay. Now you.

1005
01:57:05,602 --> 01:57:08,230
- 我不用
- 来吧，你也抹点吧
- I'm okay.
- No, come on, you need it, too.

1006
01:57:08,313 --> 01:57:09,690
来
Come on.

1007
01:57:09,773 --> 01:57:11,066
好吧
All right.

1008
01:58:10,584 --> 01:58:11,585
嗨
Hi.

1009
01:58:14,713 --> 01:58:16,215
你痊愈得这么快
You're so much better.

1010
01:58:18,508 --> 01:58:19,843
哦，天呐！皮塔
Oh, my God, Peeta.

1011
01:58:20,969 --> 01:58:22,763
我感觉好像没受过伤一样
I hardly feel anything.

1012
01:58:23,972 --> 01:58:25,682
我们能回家了
We could go home.

1013
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:29,102
是的，我们是这组里仅存的两个人
We could. We're the only team left.

1014
01:58:29,728 --> 01:58:31,355
我们要回家了
We could go home.

1015
01:58:36,151 --> 01:58:37,819
我们现在得知斯瑞斯离开了
（注：斯瑞斯，11区男性参赛者，
他能活着的唯一依靠就是一身蛮力）
We know Thresh took off.

1016
01:58:37,903 --> 01:58:39,696
卡托会去丰饶角那
Cato's gonna be by the Cornucopia.

1017
01:58:39,780 --> 01:58:41,823
他不会到自己没去过的地方
He's not gonna go someplace
he doesn't know.

1018
01:58:41,907 --> 01:58:45,000
福克斯费斯不一定在哪呢
（注：福克斯费斯，5区女性参赛者，
靠头脑作战，擅长军事布局与策略）
Foxface, she could be anywhere.

1019
01:58:47,037 --> 01:58:50,249
咱们应该在这附近打猎
带的食物都吃光了
We should probably hunt around here.
We don't have any food left.

1020
01:58:50,332 --> 01:58:51,959
好吧，我来射箭吧
Okay, I'll take the bow.

1021
01:58:54,002 --> 01:58:56,505
开玩笑罢了，我去采点果子
I'm just kidding. I'll go pick some stuff.

1022
01:59:14,731 --> 01:59:15,899
皮塔？
Peeta?

1023
01:59:20,445 --> 01:59:21,571
皮塔？
Peeta?

1024
01:59:24,658 --> 01:59:25,826
皮塔！
Peeta!

1025
01:59:27,035 --> 01:59:28,078
皮塔！
Peeta!

1026
01:59:28,161 --> 01:59:29,288
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

1027
01:59:29,371 --> 01:59:31,164
- 我听到加农炮的声音了，我以为…
- 不
- I heard the cannon. I thought...
- No.

1028
01:59:31,248 --> 01:59:34,459
那是毒浆果，皮塔！吃它会要了你的命！
That's Nightlock, Peeta!
You'd be dead in a minute!

1029
01:59:34,543 --> 01:59:35,669
我不知道
I didn't know.

1030
01:59:35,752 --> 01:59:38,088
该死的，你差点吓死我了
You scared me to death. Damn you.

1031
01:59:38,922 --> 01:59:40,257
对不起
I'm sorry.

1032
01:59:41,675 --> 01:59:43,051
对不起
I'm sorry.

1033
01:59:51,143 --> 01:59:53,312
我还不知道她在一直跟踪我
I never even knew she was following me.

1034
01:59:53,395 --> 01:59:54,896
她真聪明
She's clever.

1035
01:59:55,147 --> 01:59:56,523
聪明极了
Too clever.

1036
01:59:57,858 --> 02:00:01,028
- 你在干什么？
- 也许卡托会喜欢这些浆果
- What are you doing?
- Maybe Cato likes berries, too.

1037
02:00:07,117 --> 02:00:08,618
现在几点了？
What time is it?

1038
02:00:08,702 --> 02:00:10,120
刚到下午
A little after noon.

1039
02:00:10,203 --> 02:00:11,288
为什么天色这么黑？
Why is it getting so dark?

1040
02:00:11,413 --> 02:00:13,040
看来要尽早结束这场争斗了
Must be in a hurry to end it.

1041
02:00:16,460 --> 02:00:19,004
- 准备好了吗， 露西娅？
- 在这，先生
- You ready, Lucia?
- Right here, sir.

1042
02:00:20,380 --> 02:00:22,090
很好，太棒了
Well, that's great.

1043
02:00:22,591 --> 02:00:23,967
- 可以把它放到竞技场吗？
- 没问题
- Now can you put that in the middle?
- Sure.

1044
02:00:33,143 --> 02:00:36,688
就是这样，效果一定不错
That's it. That's excellent.

1045
02:00:48,408 --> 02:00:50,077
你听见了吗？
Did you hear that?

1046
02:01:22,401 --> 02:01:23,652
那是什么声音？
What was that?

1047
02:01:24,778 --> 02:01:26,446
惨叫
It's the finale.

1048
02:01:41,837 --> 02:01:42,838
我们走吧
Let's go.

1049
02:02:51,907 --> 02:02:52,908
快跑
Go.

1050
02:03:10,133 --> 02:03:11,134
凯特尼斯！
Katniss!

1051
02:03:36,660 --> 02:03:37,911
上去！
Here!

1052
02:04:50,734 --> 02:04:53,194
来啊，射我啊
Go on. Shoot.

1053
02:04:55,655 --> 02:04:57,866
我们俩都掉下去，你就赢了
Then we both go down and you'd win.

1054
02:05:01,202 --> 02:05:05,624
来吧，反正我死定了
Go on. I'm dead anyway.

1055
02:05:10,629 --> 02:05:12,380
一向如此，对吗？
I always was, right?

1056
02:05:14,799 --> 02:05:16,843
直到现在我才知道
I didn't know that till now.

1057
02:05:20,180 --> 02:05:22,057
怎么会这样呢？这就是他们想要的吗？
How is that? Is that what they want?

1058
02:05:24,643 --> 02:05:26,645
- 不
- 不，不要
- No.
- No, no.

1059
02:05:28,355 --> 02:05:29,731
我也可以把他的脖子扭断的
I could still do this.

1060
02:05:31,232 --> 02:05:33,109
我会的
I could still do this.

1061
02:05:34,069 --> 02:05:35,945
再杀一个又能怎样
One more kill.

1062
02:05:38,198 --> 02:05:40,742
这使我唯一知道怎么做的事
It's the only thing I know how to do.

1063
02:05:41,076 --> 02:05:43,286
为我所在地的区域带来荣耀
Bring pride to my district.

1064
02:05:46,956 --> 02:05:48,750
这并不重要
Not that it matters.

1065
02:06:05,266 --> 02:06:06,434
求你了！
Please!

1066
02:06:08,186 --> 02:06:09,187
不！
No!

1067
02:06:15,944 --> 02:06:16,945
求你杀了我吧！
Please!

1068
02:07:04,492 --> 02:07:06,995
贡品请注意，贡品请注意
<i>Attention. Attention, Tributes.</i>

1069
02:07:07,162 --> 02:07:10,582
规则稍有变化
<i>There has been a slight rule change.</i>

1070
02:07:10,707 --> 02:07:12,584
之前允许同一区域的两人
<i>The previous revision,</i>

1071
02:07:12,667 --> 02:07:15,920
可作为胜者的规则
<i>allowing for two victors
from the same district,</i>

1072
02:07:16,004 --> 02:07:18,047
已被废除
<i>has been revoked.</i>

1073
02:07:19,215 --> 02:07:23,344
新规则规定只允许有一名胜者，祝你们好运
<i>Only one victor may be crowned. Good luck.</i>

1074
02:07:24,512 --> 02:07:27,515
希望好运永远站在你这边
<i>And may the odds be ever in your favor.</i>

1075
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:43,531
来吧
Go ahead.

1076
02:07:47,619 --> 02:07:49,496
只有一个人能回家
One of us should go home.

1077
02:07:50,330 --> 02:07:53,708
必须要有人作出牺牲，他们只要一个胜者
One of us has to die.
They have to have their victor.

1078
02:07:54,292 --> 02:07:55,376
不
No.

1079
02:07:56,586 --> 02:07:58,004
他们不能这样
They don't.

1080
02:07:59,839 --> 02:08:01,049
为什么总任由他们摆布？
Why should they?

1081
02:08:02,175 --> 02:08:03,885
- 不！
- 相信我
- No!
- Trust me.

1082
02:08:04,886 --> 02:08:06,137
相信我
Trust me.

1083
02:08:25,031 --> 02:08:26,449
一起来？
Together?

1084
02:08:27,992 --> 02:08:29,244
一起
Together.

1085
02:08:30,495 --> 02:08:31,579
好的
Okay.

1086
02:08:32,664 --> 02:08:33,832
1
One...


1087
02:08:36,084 --> 02:08:37,335
2
Two...


1088
02:08:43,424 --> 02:08:44,634
3
Three.

1089
02:08:46,302 --> 02:08:47,554
住手！
<i>Stop!</i>

1090
02:08:48,346 --> 02:08:49,597
住手！
<i>Stop!</i>

1091
02:08:53,059 --> 02:08:56,604
女士们，先生们，我来介绍一下
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
may I present the winners</i>

1092
02:08:57,480 --> 02:09:00,275
第74届年度饥饿游戏的胜者
<i>of the 74th Annual Hunger Games.</i>

1093
02:09:27,385 --> 02:09:29,304
他们对你并不满意
<i>They're not happy with you.</i>

1094
02:09:29,971 --> 02:09:32,015
为什么？因为我没死吗？
Why? Because I didn't die?

1095
02:09:32,473 --> 02:09:34,267
因为你让他们出丑了
Because you showed them up.

1096
02:09:35,143 --> 02:09:37,937
好吧，对不起，我没按规则办事
Well, I'm sorry
it didn't go the way they planned.

1097
02:09:38,021 --> 02:09:40,231
- 我对他们也不满意
- 凯特尼斯！
- I'm not very happy with them either.
- Katniss!

1098
02:09:40,857 --> 02:09:43,985
严肃一点，这不只是为了你自己
This is serious. Notjust for you.

1099
02:09:44,402 --> 02:09:46,529
他们不会就这么轻易罢手的
They don't take these things lightly.

1100
02:10:38,414 --> 02:10:40,750
当他们问你的时候，你就说控制不住自己
When they ask,
you say you couldn't help yourself.

1101
02:10:40,833 --> 02:10:43,211
你和这个男孩很恩爱
You were so in love with this boy

1102
02:10:43,294 --> 02:10:47,382
不敢想象没有他会是什么样子
that the thought of not being with him
was unthinkable.

1103
02:10:47,548 --> 02:10:51,761
如果失去他不如让我去死，明白吗？
You'd rather die than not be with him.
You understand?

1104
02:10:52,261 --> 02:10:56,724
当你在河边找到他的时候是什么感觉？
How did you feel
when you found him by that river?

1105
02:11:01,396 --> 02:11:03,648
感觉我是全世界最幸福的人
I felt like the happiest person in the world.

1106
02:11:07,777 --> 02:11:10,321
不敢想象没有他生活会变成什么样子
I couldn't imagine life without him.

1107
02:11:16,995 --> 02:11:18,621
你呢，皮塔？
And what about you, Peeta?

1108
02:11:19,747 --> 02:11:21,457
他救了我一命
She saved my life.

1109
02:11:21,541 --> 02:11:22,583
我们拯救了彼此
We saved each other.

1110
02:11:24,335 --> 02:11:28,840
女士们，先生们，第74届年度饥饿游戏总冠军是
Ladies and gentlemen,
the star-crossed lovers from District 12,

1111
02:11:28,923 --> 02:11:34,595
来自第12区的倒霉情侣！
this year's victors
of the 74th Annual Hunger Games!

1112
02:11:51,195 --> 02:11:52,697
恭喜你们
Congratulations.

1113
02:11:52,780 --> 02:11:54,115
谢谢
Thank you.

1114
02:11:59,954 --> 02:12:01,372
胸针很漂亮
What a lovely pin.

1115
02:12:01,456 --> 02:12:03,833
谢谢，这是我们区域的馈赠
Thank you. It's from my district.

1116
02:12:04,584 --> 02:12:06,878
他们一定会为你感到非常骄傲的
They must be very proud of you.

1117
02:12:19,682 --> 02:12:22,101
回去了我们会怎么样？
So what happens when we get back?

1118
02:12:23,478 --> 02:12:27,398
不知道，我想我们应该试着忘记这段经历
I don't know. I guess we try to forget.

1119
02:12:32,278 --> 02:12:34,155
我不想忘掉
I don't want to forget.

1120
02:13:25,582 --> 02:13:28,261
