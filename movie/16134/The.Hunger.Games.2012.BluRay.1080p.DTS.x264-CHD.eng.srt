00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:34,828
<i>Let's have a big hand for
our very first volunteer, Katniss Everdeen.</i>

162
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,885
<i>And now for the boys.</i>

163
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,230
<i>Peeta Mellark.</i>

164
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:27,505
<i>Here we are.</i>

165
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:31,426
<i>Our Tributes from District 12.</i>

166
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,387
<i>Well, go on, you two, shake hands.</i>

167
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,569
<i>Happy Hunger Games.</i>

168
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:53,865
<i>And may the odds be ever in your favor.</i>

169
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:08,880
You have three minutes.

170
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:13,593
It's okay.

171
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:18,264
Prim. Prim. It's okay.
Prim, I don't have much time.

172
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:22,894
Prim. Listen. You're gonna be okay.
Don't take any extra food from them.

173
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,188
It isn't worth putting your name in
more times. Okay?

174
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:29,234
Listen, Prim. Gale will bring you game.
You can sell cheese from your goat.

175
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,903
Just try to win. Maybe you can.

176
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:33,988
Of course.

177
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:36,991
And maybe I can. I am smart, you know?

178
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:39,828
- And you can hunt.
- Exactly.

179
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,836
To protect you.

180
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,676
Thank you.

181
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,899
You can't tune out again.

182
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:13,862
- I won't.
- No, you can't. Not like when Dad died.

183
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,613
I won't be there anymore. You're all she has.

184
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:18,741
No matter what you feel, you have to
be there for her. Do you understand?

185
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,786
Don't cry.

186
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,458
Don't cry. Don't. Don't.

187
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,671
- It's time.
- Prim, it's okay.

188
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:35,633
- Prim, it's okay. It's okay, Prim.
- No!No!No!

189
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:37,677
I promise, Prim.

190
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:56,613
- I'm fine.
- Yeah, I know.

191
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:57,906
I am.

192
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:02,827
Listen to me. You're stronger than they are.
You are.

193
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,162
- Get to a bow.
- They may not have...

194
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:06,497
They will if you show them
how good you are.

195
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:08,708
They just want a good show.
That's all they want.

196
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,627
If they don't have a bow,
then you make one, okay?

197
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,211
You know how to hunt.

198
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:13,546
Animals.

199
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:16,341
It's no different, Katniss.

200
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:21,512
There's 24 of us, Gale. Only one comes out.

201
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:23,765
Yeah. And it's gonna be you.

202
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:25,391
Okay.

203
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,644
Take care of them, Gale.
Whatever you do, don't let them starve.

204
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,771
- Let's go.
- I'll see you soon, okay?

205
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:34,692
You two are in for a treat.

206
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:38,446
Crystal chandeliers, platinum doorknobs,
and it flies.

207
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,698
We'll be at The Capitol
in less than two days.

208
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:43,284
Now, before you do anything else...

209
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,260
<i>200 miles per hour,
and you can barely feel a thing.</i>

210
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:45,096
I think it's one of the wonderful things about
this opportunity,

211
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:48,725
that even though you're here
and even though it's just for a little while,

212
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,352
you get to enjoy all of this.

213
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:59,444
I'm going to find Haymitch.
He's probably in the bar car.

214
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:13,374
Have you ever met him?

215
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:17,420
Haymitch?

216
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:25,887
You know, Katniss, he is our mentor.
He did win this thing once.

217
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,146
Look, you know,
if you don't want to talk, I understand,

218
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:38,441
but I just don't think there's anything wrong
with getting a little bit of help.

219
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,926
Congratulations.

220
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,488
Where's the ice?

221
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:28,449
I don't know.

222
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:35,957
May I?

223
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:44,549
Okay, so... So when do we start?

224
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,343
So eager.

225
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:50,638
Most of you aren't in such a hurry.

226
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:53,224
Yeah. I wanna know what the plan is.
You're our mentor.

227
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:54,642
- You're supposed to go...
- Mentor?

228
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,019
Yeah, our mentor.

229
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,772
You're supposed to tell us
how to get sponsors and give us advice.

230
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:01,732
Okay.

231
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:07,155
Embrace the probability
of your imminent death.

232
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:14,370
And know, in your heart,
that there's nothing I can do to save you.

233
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,373
So why are you here then?

234
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:19,625
The refreshments.

235
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:21,169
Okay, I think that's enough of that.

236
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:29,594
You made me spill my drink.
These are brand new pants.

237
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:34,682
You know, I think I'll go
finish this in my room.

238
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:52,575
He's gonna come around.

239
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:53,784
It's no use.

240
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:55,786
I'm gonna go talk to him.

241
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:05,838
<i>We have two very fit 16-year-olds.</i>

242
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:09,258
<i>Of course, of course.
They always provide pretty good opponents.</i>

243
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:10,676
<i>Yes, yes, they do.</i>

244
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,637
<i>- Do you remember this year?
- Of course.</i>

245
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,307
<i>One of my favorite years.
And one of my favorite Arenas.</i>

246
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:19,310
<i>The use of the rubble in the ruined city...</i>

247
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,645
<i>Very exciting.</i>

248
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:22,313
<i>And this moment here,</i>

249
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:24,982
<i>this moment is a moment
that you never forget.</i>

250
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:26,400
<i>Yes.</i>

251
00:25:26,484 --> 00:25:29,570
<i>The moment when a Tribute
becomes a victor.</i>

252
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:07,650
- You'd freeze to death first.
- No, because I'd light a fire.

253
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,360
That's a good way to get killed.

254
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:11,028
What's a good way to get killed?

255
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:15,074
Joy. Why don't you join us?

256
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:18,911
I was just giving some life-saving advice.

257
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:21,497
Like what?

258
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,874
I was just asking about how to find shelter.

259
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:28,045
Which would come in handy if,
in fact, you were still alive.

260
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:31,799
How do you find shelter?

261
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:34,010
Pass the jam.

262
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,678
How do you find shelter?

263
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:38,556
Give me a chance to wake up , sweetheart.

264
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:43,894
This mentoring is very taxing stuff.

265
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,402
Can you pass the marmalade?

266
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:54,739
That is mahogany!

267
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:58,993
Look at you. Just killed a placemat.

268
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:02,747
You really want to know how to stay alive?

269
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,000
You get people to like you.

270
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:11,172
Not what you were expecting?

271
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:17,470
Well, when you're in the middle of
The Games and you're starving or freezing,

272
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:20,973
some water, a knife, or even some matches

273
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:23,559
can mean the difference
between life and death.

274
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:27,063
And those things only come from sponsors.

275
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:31,734
And to get sponsors,
you have to make people like you.

276
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:38,240
And right now, sweetheart,
you're not off to a real good start.

277
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,576
There it is.

278
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:47,208
It's huge!

279
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:49,835
That's incredible.

280
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:16,028
Peeta, I love you.

281
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,831
Come on. Come on.

282
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:35,297
You better keep this knife.
He knows what he's doing.

283
00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:47,852
<i>So now that you've seen them,</i>

284
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:50,729
<i>what do you think about
this year's crop of recruits?</i>

285
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:54,024
Are there any surprises
that we can expect this year?

286
00:28:54,108 --> 00:28:55,651
It's really hard to tell just from a Reaping,

287
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:59,155
-but I think this is a very interesting mix.
- Yes.

288
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:01,449
And whenever you have a volunteer
from an outlying district,

289
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:03,868
<i>that's something you can't ignore.</i>

290
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:32,480
What's that?

291
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:34,982
What's that?

292
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:37,234
We're just saying we might need
to hose you down again

293
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:39,445
before we take you to Cinna.

294
00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:50,206
That was one of the bravest things
I've ever seen. With your sister?

295
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:52,500
- My name's Cinna.
- Katniss.

296
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,044
I'm sorry that this happened to you,

297
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,087
and I'm here to help you
in any way that I can.

298
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,634
Most people just congratulate me.

299
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:04,011
Well, I don't see the point in that.

300
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:08,057
So tonight, they have the Tribute Parade.

301
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:12,102
I'm gonna take you out
and show you off to the world.

302
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:13,938
So you're here to make me look pretty?

303
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,356
I'm here to help you make an impression.

304
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,276
Now, usually they dress people
in the clothes from their district.

305
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,737
- Yeah, we're always coalminers.
- Yeah, but I don't wanna do that.

306
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,241
I wanna do something
that they're gonna remember.

307
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,868
Did they explain
about trying to get sponsors?

308
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:30,663
Yeah, but I'm not very good
at making friends.

309
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:32,331
We'll see.

310
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:36,126
I just think somebody that brave

311
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:41,382
shouldn't be dressed up
in some stupid costume, now should they?

312
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,219
I hope not.

313
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:54,478
Okay, this is safe. I promise.

314
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:57,815
It's not real fire. These suits are built
so you won't feel a thing.

315
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,149
Looks pretty real to me.

316
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:00,818
Well, that's the idea.

317
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:01,902
You ready?

318
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:04,446
- Don't be afraid.
- I'm not afraid.

319
00:31:24,842 --> 00:31:30,264
Over 100,000 people craning
to get a glimpse of this year's Tributes.

320
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:33,350
<i>And the sponsors get to see the Tributes
for the first time.</i>

321
00:31:33,434 --> 00:31:36,353
The importance of this moment
cannot be overstated.

322
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:42,651
Very nice.

323
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:47,948
First chariot on my count, in 15, 14, 13...

324
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:53,954
There they are. There they are.
This year's Tributes.

325
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:56,040
<i>It's the most exciting part.</i>

326
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:58,042
<i>It just gives you goose bumps.</i>

327
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,252
<i>And don't you love how the stylists,</i>

328
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:04,631
they so clearly are able to
reflect the character of each district?

329
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,718
<i>- Right. Right. There's District 4.
- Yes.</i>

330
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:09,720
<i>- Fishing.
- I get it.</i>

331
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,972
<i>- I like it.
- That's very good.</i>

332
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:17,102
And behind them,
we have two power plant workers. Right?

333
00:32:17,186 --> 00:32:18,562
And then...

334
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,899
What is that in the background?

335
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:49,843
Come on. They'll love it.

336
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:57,935
Yeah!

337
00:32:58,018 --> 00:32:59,478
<i>Now see that? I love that.</i>

338
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:02,272
<i>Two young people
holding their hands up, saying,</i>

339
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:06,151
<i>"I'm proud I come from District 12.
We will not be overlooked."</i>

340
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:07,403
- Nope.
- I love that!

341
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:10,197
<i>People are sure gonna be paying attention
to them right now.</i>

342
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:14,326
And we're ready.

343
00:33:14,535 --> 00:33:15,911
<i>President Snow, you're live.</i>

344
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:47,651
<i>Welcome.</i>

345
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:52,823
<i>Welcome.</i>

346
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:57,286
<i>Tributes, we welcome you.</i>

347
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:04,334
<i>We salute your courage and your sacrifice.</i>

348
00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:10,090
<i>And we wish you</i>

349
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:14,094
<i>Happy Hunger Games.</i>

350
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:18,432
<i>And may the odds be ever in your favor.</i>

351
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:33,030
That was amazing.

352
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:35,616
We are all
anybody's going to be talking about.

353
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,367
So brave.

354
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:39,578
Are you sure you should be
near an open flame?

355
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:42,998
Fake flame? Are you sure you...

356
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:54,551
Let's go upstairs.

357
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:00,432
So, each of the districts get their own floor.

358
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:03,977
And because you're from 12,
you get the penthouse.

359
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:12,486
Come on.

360
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:18,617
So this is the living room.

361
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:21,495
I know, I know.

362
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:24,998
Now, your rooms are right over here.

363
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:28,835
Why don't you go clean yourselves up
a little before dinner?

364
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:50,208
In two weeks, 23 of you will be dead.

365
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:52,252
One of you will be alive.

366
00:36:52,336 --> 00:36:56,715
Who that is depends on how well
you pay attention over the next four days,

367
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:59,384
particularly to what I'm about to say.

368
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:02,554
First, no fighting with the other Tributes.

369
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:04,514
You'll have plenty of time for that
in the Arena.

370
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:09,478
There are four compulsory exercises.
The rest will be individual training.

371
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,564
My advice is don't ignore the survival skills.

372
00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:14,232
Everybody wants to grab a sword,

373
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:17,027
but most of you will die
from natural causes.

374
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:20,989
10% from infection, 20% from dehydration.

375
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,950
Exposure can kill as easily as a knife.

376
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:58,485
- Jason, where's my knife, huh?
- I didn't touch your knife.

377
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:01,154
- I put my knife right there!
- Don't touch me. I didn't touch your knife!

378
00:38:01,238 --> 00:38:02,781
- Yes, you took my knife!
- I didn't touch your knife!

379
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:04,449
- You took my knife, you liar!
- I didn't touch your knife.

380
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:05,534
- You liar!
- I didn't touch your knife!

381
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,744
You little punk! He took my knife!

382
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:09,579
- Get off me!
- I'm just sitting here.

383
00:38:09,663 --> 00:38:12,249
I'll finish you right now, kid!

384
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:14,042
Actually, better yet, I'll wait for the Arena.

385
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:15,627
You're the first one I get,
so watch your back.

386
00:38:19,423 --> 00:38:22,300
- Everybody, back in line!
- You know who you're messing with, kid!

387
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:24,761
He's a Career. You know what that is?

388
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:26,847
- From District 1.
- And 2.

389
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:30,767
They train in a special academy
until they're 18. Then they volunteer.

390
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:34,062
By that point, they're pretty lethal.

391
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:36,231
But they don't receive any special treatment.

392
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,817
In fact, they stay in the exact
same apartment as you do.

393
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,903
And I don't think they let them have dessert.
And you can.

394
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:44,698
So how good are they?

395
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:49,286
Obviously they're pretty good.
They win it almost every year, but...

396
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:50,620
Almost.

397
00:38:50,871 --> 00:38:52,873
...they can be arrogant.

398
00:38:53,457 --> 00:38:56,960
And arrogance can be a big problem.

399
00:38:59,296 --> 00:39:01,298
I hear you can shoot.

400
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,302
I'm all right.

401
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:07,929
No, she's better than all right.
My father buys her squirrels.

402
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:12,058
He says she hits them
right in the eye every time.

403
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,645
- Peeta's strong.
- What?

404
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:18,148
He can throw a 100-pound sack
of flour right over his head. I've seen it.

405
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:20,609
Okay, well, I'm not gonna kill
anybody with a sack of flour.

406
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,319
No, but you might have
a better chance of winning

407
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:23,653
if somebody comes after you with a knife.

408
00:39:23,737 --> 00:39:26,782
I have no chance of winning!
None! All right?

409
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:35,081
It's true. Everybody knows it.

410
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:40,420
You know what my mother said?

411
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:43,840
She said District 12
might finally have a winner.

412
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:46,009
But she wasn't talking about me.

413
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:49,471
She was talking about you.

414
00:39:54,935 --> 00:39:56,686
I'm not very hungry.

415
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:35,851
I'm done, too.

416
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,520
Throw that metal thing over there.

417
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:21,980
What?

418
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:27,193
No. Haymitch said we're not supposed
to show our skills.

419
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:28,278
I don't care what Haymitch said.

420
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:30,405
Those guys are looking at you
like you're a meal.

421
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,573
Throw it.

422
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:17,661
Hi.

423
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,621
Hey.

424
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:21,456
How did you do that?

425
00:42:21,915 --> 00:42:25,251
I used to decorate the cakes
down at the bakery.

426
00:42:26,503 --> 00:42:27,921
I'll show you.

427
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:31,257
See?

428
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,052
Yeah.

429
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:37,931
Hey, I think you have a shadow.

430
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:07,961
Tomorrow, they'll bring you in one by one
and evaluate you.

431
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,923
This is important, because higher ratings
will mean sponsors.

432
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:14,718
This is the time to show them everything.

433
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:17,637
There'll be a bow. Make sure you use it.

434
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:19,472
Peeta, you make sure to show your strength.

435
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:24,019
They'll start with District 1,
so the two of you will go last.

436
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:28,565
I don't know how else to put this.
Make sure they remember you.

437
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:42,287
<i>Katniss Everdeen.</i>

438
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,425
Hey, Katniss?

439
00:43:56,009 --> 00:43:57,802
Shoot straight.

440
00:44:58,154 --> 00:44:59,781
Katniss Everdeen.

441
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:02,909
District 12.

442
00:46:29,746 --> 00:46:30,914
Hey, hey, hey-

443
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:34,500
Hey, who ordered this pig?
Who ordered this pig? Hey!

444
00:46:34,584 --> 00:46:35,877
Did you get some pig yet?

445
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:56,522
Thank you for your consideration.

446
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:04,447
- Are you crazy?
- I just got mad.

447
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,657
Mad?

448
00:47:06,366 --> 00:47:11,454
You realize that your actions reflect badly
on all of us. Notjust you.

449
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:13,081
They just want a good show. It's fine.

450
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:16,751
How about it's just bad manners, Cinna!
How about that?

451
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:21,256
Well, finally! I hope you noticed
we have a serious situation.

452
00:47:25,093 --> 00:47:27,136
Nice shooting, sweetheart.

453
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:32,642
What did they do when you shot the apple?

454
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,061
Well, they looked pretty startled.

455
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:36,437
Yeah.

456
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:40,984
Now, what did you say? "Thanks for..."

457
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:42,652
- Thanks for your consideration.
-"...your consideration."

458
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:45,071
Genius! Genius.

459
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:49,826
I don't think we're gonna find this funny
if the Gamemakers decide to take it out...

460
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:51,369
On who? On her?

461
00:47:52,245 --> 00:47:53,663
On him?

462
00:47:53,746 --> 00:47:56,749
I think they already have.
Loosen your corset, have a drink.

463
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:00,420
I would have given anything to see it.

464
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:04,173
<i>As you know, the Tributes were rated
on a scale of 1 to 12</i>

465
00:48:04,257 --> 00:48:07,093
<i>after three days of careful evaluation.</i>

466
00:48:07,302 --> 00:48:10,888
<i>The Gamekeepers would like
to acknowledge that it was an exceptional...</i>

467
00:48:11,431 --> 00:48:16,311
<i>From District 1, Marvel, with a score of nine.</i>

468
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:19,939

469
00:48:20,023 --> 00:48:22,233
<i>Clove, with a score of 10.</i>

470
00:48:22,317 --> 00:48:25,528
<i>From District 3...
From District 4, with a score of...</i>

471
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:26,988
<i>From District 7...</i>

472
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:28,740
<i>From District 8...</i>

473
00:48:29,449 --> 00:48:32,118
<i>And Rue with a score of seven.</i>

474
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:33,911
<i>Now our final district.</i>

475
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:38,666
<i>From District 12. Peeta Mellark.</i>

476
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:45,173
<i>A score of eight.</i>

477
00:48:46,466 --> 00:48:47,759
- Excellent.
- Peeta!

478
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:48,885
Bravo.

479
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:51,179
- We can work with that.
- Good job.

480
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:54,974
<i>And finally,</i>

481
00:48:57,477 --> 00:48:58,853
<i>from District 12,</i>

482
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:03,232
<i>Katniss E verdeen.</i>

483
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:08,488
<i>With a score of...</i>

484
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:12,658
<i>Eleven.</i>

485
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:16,496
- Katniss!
- Outstanding!

486
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:18,039
- Yes!
- Eleven?

487
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:20,208
Congratulations.

488
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:21,626
I thought they hated me.

489
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:23,044
They must have liked your guts.

490
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:27,256
To Katniss Everdeen, The Girl on Fire!

491
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:30,176
Goodness. We are.

492
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:31,511
An 11?

493
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:32,970
She earned it.

494
00:49:33,054 --> 00:49:35,098
She shot an arrow at your head.

495
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:36,474
Well, at an apple.

496
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:37,809
Near your head.

497
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:39,852
Sit down.

498
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:48,194
Seneca, why do you think we have a winner?

499
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:52,031
What do you mean?

500
00:49:52,949 --> 00:49:56,702
I mean, why do we have a winner?

501
00:49:59,288 --> 00:50:01,207
I mean, if we just wanted to
intimidate the districts,

502
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:05,878
why not round up 24 of them at random
and execute them all at once?

503
00:50:05,962 --> 00:50:07,713
Be a lot faster.

504
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:11,134
Hope.

505
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:13,177
Hope?

506
00:50:13,261 --> 00:50:14,345
Hope.

507
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:18,307
It is the only thing stronger than fear.

508
00:50:19,809 --> 00:50:23,604
A little hope is effective.
A lot of hope is dangerous.

509
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:26,983
A spark is fine, as long as it's contained.

510
00:50:29,444 --> 00:50:30,445
So...

511
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:34,657
So contain it.

512
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:38,244
Right.

513
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:41,581
So she's staring at all my jewels.
She cannot take her eyes off of them.

514
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:44,083
- Well, look at all that that you're wearing.
- Frankly, it was rude.

515
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:46,794
Haymitch, you should join us.

516
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:49,338
We're having some of
your favorite for dinner.

517
00:50:49,422 --> 00:50:50,590
Lovely.

518
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:56,554
- Where's Peeta?
- He's in his room.

519
00:50:56,637 --> 00:51:00,516
Now, listen, tomorrow's the last day.

520
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,227
And they let us work with our own Tributes
right before The Games,

521
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:06,105
so you and I will be going down at 9:00.

522
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,108
What about him?

523
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:13,279
He says he wants to be trained
on his own from now on.

524
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:15,615
What?

525
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:21,162
This kind of thing does happen at this point.
There's only one winner, right?

526
00:51:27,627 --> 00:51:29,712
We should have some
chocolate-covered strawberries.

527
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,631
- Oh, my, yes.
- Please.

528
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:38,179
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
your master of ceremonies,</i>

529
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:40,973
<i>Caesar Flickerman!</i>

530
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:47,521
<i>Thank you! Thank you!</i>

531
00:51:49,065 --> 00:51:54,946
<i>Welcome, welcome, welcome
to the 74th Annual Hunger Games!</i>

532
00:51:56,155 --> 00:52:00,284
<i>Now, in about five minutes,
they're all going to be out here.</i>

533
00:52:00,368 --> 00:52:02,954
<i>All of the Tributes that you've heard about.</i>

534
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:04,413
<i>Are you excited?</i>

535
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:06,874
<i>Let me hear it!</i>

536
00:52:10,211 --> 00:52:11,462
Amazing.

537
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:14,674
I don't feel amazing.

538
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:16,676
Don't you know how beautiful you look?

539
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:18,594
No. And I don't know
how to make people like me.

540
00:52:18,678 --> 00:52:21,264
- How do you make people like you?
- Well, you made me like you.

541
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:22,640
That's different. I wasn't trying.

542
00:52:22,723 --> 00:52:26,727
Exactly. Just be yourself,
I'll be there the whole time.

543
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:30,356
And just pretend
that you're talking to me. Okay?

544
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:31,691
Okay.

545
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:33,776
<i>Let's see if she does indeed shine.</i>

546
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:37,280
<i>Let's have a warm round of applause
for Glimmer!</i>

547
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:43,494
<i>Glimmer, are you prepared?</i>

548
00:52:43,703 --> 00:52:45,830
<i>Yes, Caesar, I am very prepared.</i>

549
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:48,666
<i>I like it. That's assurance.
That's self-assurance.</i>

550
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:49,959
<i>- Don't you think?
- And, as you can see...</i>

551
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:51,836
<i>...I'm wearing one of our own creations.</i>

552
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:54,714
<i>A big round of applause!</i>

553
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:58,551
Marvel!

554
00:53:01,721 --> 00:53:03,180
<i>Welcome, Clove.</i>

555
00:53:03,264 --> 00:53:05,141
- It's an honor representing my district.
- You're a fighter.

556
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:07,643
I'm prepared. I'm vicious. I'm ready to go.

557
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:10,062
Cato!

558
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:13,649
I find that if I can apply myself
to the situation present,

559
00:53:13,733 --> 00:53:15,026
I will be able to figure it out.

560
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:18,571
<i>Thank you. Lovely to see you.
Thank you so much.</i>

561
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,492
<i>Good. So you can climb trees.</i>

562
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:25,953
You're pretty quick. And are you a hunter?

563
00:53:26,162 --> 00:53:27,621
<i>A gatherer?</i>

564
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,506
<i>From District 12, District 12...</i>

565
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:40,760
<i>You know her as The Girl on Fire!</i>

566
00:53:43,596 --> 00:53:46,682
<i>Well, we know her
as the lovely Katniss Everdeen!</i>

567
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:04,950
<i>Welcome! Welcome.</i>

568
00:54:07,536 --> 00:54:08,788
<i>Welcome.</i>

569
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:13,125
<i>Well, that was quite an entrance
you made the other day.</i>

570
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:17,296
What?

571
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:21,092
I think someone's a little nervous.

572
00:54:22,927 --> 00:54:25,763
I said that was quite an entrance
that you made

573
00:54:25,846 --> 00:54:27,598
at the Tribute Parade the other day.

574
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:29,850
Do you want to tell us about it?

575
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:34,230
Well, I was just hoping that
I wouldn't burn to death.

576
00:54:42,738 --> 00:54:44,240
When you came out of that chariot,

577
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:47,827
I have to say, my heart stopped.

578
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:50,830
Did any of you experience this as well?

579
00:54:50,913 --> 00:54:52,331
My heart stopped.

580
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:56,710
So did mine.

581
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:01,799
Now, tell me about the flames. Are they real?

582
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:03,008
Yes.

583
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:11,475
In fact, I'm wearing them today.
Would you like to see?

584
00:55:12,685 --> 00:55:15,312
Wait, wait, wait. Is it safe?

585
00:55:15,396 --> 00:55:16,689
Yes.

586
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:18,357
What do you think, folks?

587
00:55:20,276 --> 00:55:21,318
I think that's a yes.

588
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:50,556
Steady. Steady.

589
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:53,058
Lovely. Thank you.

590
00:55:55,478 --> 00:55:58,689
That was really something.
Katniss, that was something.

591
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:01,150
That was something. Thank you for that.

592
00:56:03,402 --> 00:56:05,779
I have one more question for you.

593
00:56:07,323 --> 00:56:08,782
It's about your sister.

594
00:56:11,494 --> 00:56:17,583
We were all very moved, I think, when
you volunteered for her at the Reaping.

595
00:56:19,752 --> 00:56:22,296
Did she come and say goodbye to you?

596
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,422
Yes.

597
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:25,549
- She did.
- She did.

598
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:31,430
And what did you say to her in the end?

599
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:36,936
I told her that I would try to win.

600
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:40,773
That I would try to win for her.

601
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:43,275
Of course you did.

602
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,737
And try you will.

603
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:50,533
Ladies and gentlemen, from District 12,

604
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:54,119
Katniss Everdeen, The Girl on Fire!

605
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,545
You did it, darling. That was incredible.

606
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:04,046
Thank you.

607
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,590
Nice job, sweetheart.

608
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:08,634
Thank you.

609
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:10,302
Nice dress, too.

610
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:15,015
<i>- Not yours.
- Please welcome Peeta Mellark!</i>

611
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,190
<i>Peeta, welcome.</i>

612
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:27,403
<i>How are you finding The Capitol?
And don't say, "With a map. "</i>

613
00:57:27,486 --> 00:57:30,114
<i>It's different.
It's very different than back home.</i>

614
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:33,075
<i>Different. In what way? Give us an example.</i>

615
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:35,494
<i>Okay. Well, the showers here are weird.</i>

616
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:36,996
- The showers?
- Yes.

617
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:38,664
We have different showers.

618
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:42,751
I have a question for you, Caesar.
Do I smell like roses to you?

619
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,672
- Take a whiff?
- All right.

620
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:50,217
- You see?
- Yes. Do I smell like it?

621
00:57:57,057 --> 00:57:59,560
- You definitely smell better than I do.
- Well, I've lived here longer.

622
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:00,811
That makes sense.

623
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,943
Very funny. So, Peeta, tell me,

624
00:58:09,028 --> 00:58:11,614
is there a special girl back home?

625
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:13,324
No. No. Not really.

626
00:58:13,574 --> 00:58:17,620
No? I don't believe it for a second.
Look at that face.

627
00:58:17,703 --> 00:58:21,665
Handsome man like you. Peeta, tell me.

628
00:58:24,043 --> 00:58:25,544
Well, there...

629
00:58:26,045 --> 00:58:29,381
There is this one girl
that I've had a crush on forever.

630
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:34,595
But I don't think she actually recognized me
until the Reaping.

631
00:58:37,056 --> 00:58:39,224
Well, I'll tell you what, Peeta.

632
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:44,188
You go out there and you win this thing,

633
00:58:44,647 --> 00:58:47,900
and when you get home,
she'll have to go out with you.

634
00:58:48,484 --> 00:58:49,610
Right, folks?

635
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:56,492
Thanks, but I don't think winning's
gonna help me at all.

636
00:58:56,575 --> 00:58:57,951
And why not?

637
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:03,749
Because she came here with me.

638
00:59:08,003 --> 00:59:09,588
<i>Well, that's bad luck.</i>

639
00:59:10,089 --> 00:59:11,548
<i>Yeah, it is.</i>

640
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:16,595
<i>- And I wish you all the best of luck.
- Thank you.</i>

641
00:59:17,513 --> 00:59:19,056
<i>Peeta Mellark.</i>

642
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:21,725
<i>District 12!</i>

643
00:59:25,104 --> 00:59:26,772
What the hell was that?

644
00:59:26,855 --> 00:59:28,857
You don't talk to me,
and then you say you have a crush on me?

645
00:59:28,941 --> 00:59:31,026
You say you want to train alone?
Is that how you want to play?

646
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:32,736
Stop it! Stop it!

647
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:33,987
- Let's start right now!
- Hey!

648
00:59:35,948 --> 00:59:38,117
- He did you a favor.
- He made me look weak.

649
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:42,037
He made you look desirable,
which in your case, can't hurt, sweetheart.

650
00:59:42,121 --> 00:59:43,163
He's right, Katniss.

651
00:59:43,247 --> 00:59:44,456
Of course I'm right.

652
00:59:44,707 --> 00:59:47,960
Now, I can sell the star-crossed lovers
from District 12...

653
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:49,545
We are not star-crossed lovers.

654
00:59:49,628 --> 00:59:51,380
It's a television show!

655
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:55,217
And being in love with that boy
might just get you sponsors,

656
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,636
which could save your damn life.

657
00:59:58,887 --> 01:00:01,598
Okay. Why don't you get out of here?

658
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:05,310
Maybe I can deliver you both
in one piece tomorrow.

659
01:00:05,394 --> 01:00:06,812
Manners!

660
01:00:37,885 --> 01:00:39,178
You, too?

661
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:42,347
Hey.

662
01:00:42,765 --> 01:00:43,932
Can't sleep?

663
01:00:44,016 --> 01:00:45,726
No. Of course not.

664
01:00:48,312 --> 01:00:50,397
I'm sorry I went after you.

665
01:00:53,025 --> 01:00:55,360
You know, I meant that as a compliment.

666
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:57,070
I know.

667
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:09,958
Listen to them.

668
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:13,003
Yeah.

669
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:19,885
I just don't want them to change me.

670
01:01:22,805 --> 01:01:24,515
How would they change you?

671
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:31,188
I don't know.
They'd turn me into something I'm not.

672
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:36,443
I just don't want to be
another piece in their game, you know?

673
01:01:38,529 --> 01:01:39,988
You mean you won't kill anyone?

674
01:01:42,324 --> 01:01:43,325
No.

675
01:01:44,076 --> 01:01:46,829
I mean, I'm sure I would,
just like anybody else

676
01:01:46,912 --> 01:01:47,996
when the time came,

677
01:01:49,498 --> 01:01:53,418
but I just keep wishing
that I could think of a way to show them

678
01:01:53,502 --> 01:01:55,254
that they don't own me.

679
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:02,970
If I'm gonna die, I want to still be me.

680
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,519
Does that make any sense?

681
01:02:10,602 --> 01:02:11,728
Yeah.

682
01:02:13,981 --> 01:02:16,191
I just can't afford to think like that.

683
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:22,406
I have my sister.

684
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:25,951
Yeah, I know.

685
01:02:40,674 --> 01:02:42,926
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

686
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:47,389
See you tomorrow.

687
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:17,502
They'll put all kinds of stuff right in front,
right in the mouth of the Cornucopia.

688
01:03:17,586 --> 01:03:20,339
There'll even be a bow there. Don't go for it.

689
01:03:20,422 --> 01:03:21,673
Why not?

690
01:03:21,757 --> 01:03:23,967
It's a bloodbath.
They're trying to pull you in.

691
01:03:24,051 --> 01:03:25,469
That's not your game.

692
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:29,514
You turn, run, find high ground,
look for water.

693
01:03:29,598 --> 01:03:31,808
Water's your new best friend.

694
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:36,605
Don't step off that pedestal early
or they'll blow you sky high.

695
01:03:36,688 --> 01:03:37,940
I won't.

696
01:03:49,993 --> 01:03:53,080
Katniss, you can do this.

697
01:04:01,213 --> 01:04:02,422
Thanks.

698
01:04:07,302 --> 01:04:08,929
Give me your arm.

699
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:14,434
Give me your arm.

700
01:04:20,899 --> 01:04:22,734
- Give me your arm.
- What is that?

701
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:26,989
Your tracker.

702
01:04:28,532 --> 01:04:29,533
We're up.

703
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:31,118
We're up!

704
01:04:33,245 --> 01:04:37,499
All right. Less than a minute, people.
Final checks.

705
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:39,918
There are 15 out. They are flying.

706
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:18,790
Here.

707
01:05:39,102 --> 01:05:40,437
Thank you.

708
01:05:49,029 --> 01:05:50,530
<i>Thirty seconds.</i>

709
01:05:57,996 --> 01:06:02,000
I'm not allowed to bet,
but if I could, I'd bet on you.

710
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:15,305
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

711
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:29,444
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

712
01:06:55,303 --> 01:06:57,597
Okay, they're in the tubes.

713
01:07:37,888 --> 01:07:41,933
50, 49, 48, 47,

714
01:07:42,017 --> 01:07:46,354
46, 45, 44, 43,

715
01:07:46,438 --> 01:07:49,858
42, 41, 40,

716
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:53,862
<i>39, 38, 37, 36,</i>

717
01:07:53,945 --> 01:07:58,158
<i>35, 34, 33, 32,</i>

718
01:07:58,617 --> 01:08:02,579
<i>31, 30, 29, 28,</i>

719
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:06,041
<i>27, 26, 25,</i>

720
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:09,169
<i>24, 23, 22...</i>

721
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:23,530
And, of course,
there's the familiar "boom" of the cannon,

722
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:26,658
which marks the end
of another fallen Tribute.

723
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:28,451
...eight...

724
01:11:29,536 --> 01:11:30,537
...nine...

725
01:11:31,996 --> 01:11:32,997
...10...

726
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:35,208
...11...

727
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:38,044
...12.

728
01:13:20,605 --> 01:13:21,606
Twenty-five? Got it.

729
01:13:26,361 --> 01:13:27,362
He's moving now.

730
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:03,207
Well, that makes 13 gone
in the first eight hours.

731
01:15:03,374 --> 01:15:06,669
And Claudius,
I think I see an alliance forming.

732
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:13,843
Wait! Did you see the look on her face?

733
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:15,803
- How stupid can you get?
- A fire?

734
01:15:15,887 --> 01:15:19,349
"Oh, no! Please don't kill me! Oh, no!"

735
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:21,768
That's actually a good impression.

736
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:23,269
Hey, lover boy!

737
01:15:24,771 --> 01:15:27,190
- You sure she went this way?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

738
01:15:28,232 --> 01:15:29,484
You better be.

739
01:15:29,567 --> 01:15:32,528
Yeah, that was her snare
we found back there.

740
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:40,495
Are you sure we shouldn't just kill him now?

741
01:15:40,578 --> 01:15:42,413
Nah. He's our best chance of finding her.

742
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:44,874
Let's go.

743
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,145
Sir?

744
01:16:08,231 --> 01:16:10,441
She is almost at the edge.

745
01:16:10,525 --> 01:16:13,111
<i>Two kilometers away
from the nearest Tribute.</i>

746
01:16:13,194 --> 01:16:14,529
<i>Let's turn her around.</i>

747
01:17:15,214 --> 01:17:18,259
Cueing another. On my count. One, two...

748
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:32,273
She's heading towards the left flank.

749
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:34,692
Okay. Can you give me a tree right there?

750
01:17:34,776 --> 01:17:37,403
Sure. Cueing tree.

751
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:30,790
She's almost there.

752
01:18:44,303 --> 01:18:46,639
Lucia, get a cannon ready.

753
01:18:58,693 --> 01:19:00,194
There she is! There she is!

754
01:19:02,947 --> 01:19:05,449
- She's mine!
- Not if I get her first!

755
01:19:09,996 --> 01:19:12,123
- Where you gonna go?
- Mine!

756
01:19:12,206 --> 01:19:14,750
Fish out of the pond!
And someone found her.

757
01:19:21,132 --> 01:19:23,134
- There she is!
- Yeah!

758
01:19:28,139 --> 01:19:29,599
Here we go!

759
01:19:35,438 --> 01:19:37,815
- Where you going, huh?
- Get her, Cato!

760
01:19:38,024 --> 01:19:39,483
Where do you think you're going?

761
01:19:42,528 --> 01:19:44,405
Where you going, baby?

762
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:46,908
Three o'clock.

763
01:19:49,452 --> 01:19:51,537
- Where you going, Girl on Fire?
- We got her!

764
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:53,164
Miss Everdeen, I'm gonna get you!

765
01:19:53,247 --> 01:19:54,582
That's not gonna help you up there, Katniss.

766
01:19:54,665 --> 01:19:56,375
Where are you going?

767
01:19:56,667 --> 01:19:59,211
- Go get her, man!
- You are so done.

768
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:01,297
Just get her, Cato!

769
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:02,381
- He's gonna get you, Katniss.
- Look at her scurry.

770
01:20:03,382 --> 01:20:04,383
Right up there.

771
01:20:05,259 --> 01:20:06,969
- Kill her!
- Just go, keep going!

772
01:20:08,095 --> 01:20:09,847
- Go, Cato.
- Come on, Cato.

773
01:20:09,931 --> 01:20:10,932
- She's right there.
- Go, Cato! Come on, Cato!

774
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:12,058
You got this.

775
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:13,100
Go! He's got this.

776
01:20:13,184 --> 01:20:15,686
- Kill her, Cato! Just get her, Cato!
- Go! Go!

777
01:20:15,770 --> 01:20:17,313
- Take her down!
- Go! Go!

778
01:20:17,939 --> 01:20:19,273
- You got this, Cato!
- Come on, kill her!

779
01:20:19,357 --> 01:20:20,775
I'm coming for you!

780
01:20:20,858 --> 01:20:22,318
Come on, Cato!

781
01:20:26,489 --> 01:20:28,157
I'll do it myself.

782
01:20:35,289 --> 01:20:36,791
Give me that before...

783
01:20:36,874 --> 01:20:38,918
- Get her.
- Come on. Come on, come on!

784
01:20:41,671 --> 01:20:44,048
Maybe you should throw the sword!

785
01:20:44,507 --> 01:20:46,425
Let's just wait her out.

786
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:52,598
She's gotta come down at some point.
It's that or starve to death.

787
01:20:52,682 --> 01:20:53,891
We'll just kill her then.

788
01:20:58,062 --> 01:20:59,230
Okay.

789

there will be a feast tomorrow</i>

955
01:52:22,278 --> 01:52:23,863
<i>at the Cornucopia.</i>

956
01:52:23,946 --> 01:52:27,032
<i>This will be no ordinary occasion.</i>

957
01:52:27,116 --> 01:52:30,870
<i>Each of you needs something desperately.</i>

958
01:52:30,953 --> 01:52:34,915
<i>And we plan to be generous hosts.</i>

959
01:52:34,999 --> 01:52:36,542
Your medicine.

960
01:52:36,625 --> 01:52:37,626
You're not going alone.

961
01:52:37,793 --> 01:52:39,879
Yeah? You need it, and you can't walk.

962
01:52:39,962 --> 01:52:42,715
Katniss, you're not gonna risk
your life for me. I'm not gonna let you.

963
01:52:42,798 --> 01:52:45,801
You would do it for me. Wouldn't you?

964
01:52:47,761 --> 01:52:49,471
Why are you doing this?

965
01:53:07,990 --> 01:53:10,242
Now there's no way I'm letting you go.

966
01:53:10,326 --> 01:53:11,327
Peeta...

967
01:53:11,410 --> 01:53:12,620
Please.

968
01:53:13,537 --> 01:53:14,622
Stay.

969
01:53:19,752 --> 01:53:20,878
Okay.

970
01:53:22,338 --> 01:53:23,672
I'll stay.

971
01:54:52,761 --> 01:54:54,096
Oh, God!

972
01:55:25,461 --> 01:55:27,129
Where's lover boy?

973
01:55:29,798 --> 01:55:33,635
I see. You were gonna help him, right?

974
01:55:34,303 --> 01:55:38,891
Well, that's sweet. You know, it's too bad
that you couldn't help your little friend.

975
01:55:39,475 --> 01:55:41,810
That little girl? What was her name again?

976
01:55:42,686 --> 01:55:43,771
Rue?

977
01:55:46,398 --> 01:55:48,442
Yeah, well, we killed her.

978
01:55:49,151 --> 01:55:52,196
And now we're gonna kill you.

979
01:55:58,160 --> 01:55:59,453
You kill her?

980
01:55:59,536 --> 01:56:00,746
- No!
- I heard you!

981
01:56:00,829 --> 01:56:02,748
- Cato! Cato!
- You said her name!

982
01:56:02,831 --> 01:56:04,083
You said her name!

983
01:56:14,843 --> 01:56:16,011
Just this time, 12.

984
01:56:17,179 --> 01:56:18,222
For Rue.

985
01:56:34,530 --> 01:56:37,866
Peeta, I got it. I got the medicine.

986
01:56:38,158 --> 01:56:39,618
- What happened to you?
- I'm fine.

987
01:56:39,701 --> 01:56:41,120
No, you're not. What happened?

988
01:56:41,328 --> 01:56:43,622
The girl from 2, she threw a knife. I'm okay.

989
01:56:43,705 --> 01:56:45,457
You shouldn't have gone.
You said you weren't gonna go.

990
01:56:45,541 --> 01:56:47,042
You got worse.

991
01:56:51,213 --> 01:56:52,214
I'm sorry.

992
01:56:53,757 --> 01:56:55,300
You need some of that, too.

993
01:56:55,634 --> 01:56:56,885
I'm okay.

994
01:56:59,888 --> 01:57:01,557
That feels better.

995
01:57:03,183 --> 01:57:05,310
Okay. Now you.

996
01:57:05,602 --> 01:57:08,230
- I'm okay.
- No, come on, you need it, too.

997
01:57:08,313 --> 01:57:09,690
Come on.

998
01:57:09,773 --> 01:57:11,066
All right.

999
01:58:10,584 --> 01:58:11,585
Hi.

1000
01:58:14,713 --> 01:58:16,215
You're so much better.

1001
01:58:18,508 --> 01:58:19,843
Oh, my God, Peeta.

1002
01:58:20,969 --> 01:58:22,763
I hardly feel anything.

1003
01:58:23,972 --> 01:58:25,682
We could go home.

1004
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:29,102
We could. We're the only team left.

1005
01:58:29,728 --> 01:58:31,355
We could go home.

1006
01:58:36,151 --> 01:58:37,819
We know Thresh took off.

1007
01:58:37,903 --> 01:58:39,696
Cato's gonna be by the Cornucopia.

1008
01:58:39,780 --> 01:58:41,823
He's not gonna go someplace
he doesn't know.

1009
01:58:41,907 --> 01:58:45,000
Foxface, she could be anywhere.

1010
01:58:47,037 --> 01:58:50,249
We should probably hunt around here.
We don't have any food left.

1011
01:58:50,332 --> 01:58:51,959
Okay, I'll take the bow.

1012
01:58:54,002 --> 01:58:56,505
I'm just kidding. I'll go pick some stuff.

1013
01:59:14,731 --> 01:59:15,899
Peeta?

1014
01:59:20,445 --> 01:59:21,571
Peeta?

1015
01:59:24,658 --> 01:59:25,826
Peeta!

1016
01:59:27,035 --> 01:59:28,078
Peeta!

1017
01:59:28,161 --> 01:59:29,288
Are you okay?

1018
01:59:29,371 --> 01:59:31,164
- I heard the cannon. I thought...
- No.

1019
01:59:31,248 --> 01:59:34,459
That's Nightlock, Peeta!
You'd be dead in a minute!

1020
01:59:34,543 --> 01:59:35,669
I didn't know.

1021
01:59:35,752 --> 01:59:38,088
You scared me to death. Damn you.

1022
01:59:38,922 --> 01:59:40,257
I'm sorry.

1023
01:59:41,675 --> 01:59:43,051
I'm sorry.

1024
01:59:51,143 --> 01:59:53,312
I never even knew she was following me.

1025
01:59:53,395 --> 01:59:54,896
She's clever.

1026
01:59:55,147 --> 01:59:56,523
Too clever.

1027
01:59:57,858 --> 02:00:01,028
- What are you doing?
- Maybe Cato likes berries, too.

1028
02:00:07,117 --> 02:00:08,618
What time is it?

1029
02:00:08,702 --> 02:00:10,120
A little after noon.

1030
02:00:10,203 --> 02:00:11,288
Why is it getting so dark?

1031
02:00:11,413 --> 02:00:13,040
Must be in a hurry to end it.

1032
02:00:16,460 --> 02:00:19,004
- You ready, Lucia?
- Right here, sir.

1033
02:00:20,380 --> 02:00:22,090
Well, that's great.

1034
02:00:22,591 --> 02:00:23,967
- Now can you put that in the middle?
- Sure.

1035
02:00:33,143 --> 02:00:36,688
That's it. That's excellent.

1036
02:00:48,408 --> 02:00:50,077
Did you hear that?

1037
02:01:22,401 --> 02:01:23,652
What was that?

1038
02:01:24,778 --> 02:01:26,446
It's the finale.

1039
02:01:41,837 --> 02:01:42,838
Let's go.

1040
02:02:51,907 --> 02:02:52,908
Go.

1041
02:03:10,133 --> 02:03:11,134
Katniss!

1042
02:03:36,660 --> 02:03:37,911
Here!

1043
02:04:50,734 --> 02:04:53,194
Go on. Shoot.

1044
02:04:55,655 --> 02:04:57,866
Then we both go down and you'd win.

1045
02:05:01,202 --> 02:05:05,624
Go on. I'm dead anyway.

1046
02:05:10,629 --> 02:05:12,380
I always was, right?

1047
02:05:14,799 --> 02:05:16,843
I didn't know that till now.

1048
02:05:20,180 --> 02:05:22,057
How is that? Is that what they want?

1049
02:05:24,643 --> 02:05:26,645
- No.
- No, no.

1050
02:05:28,355 --> 02:05:29,731
I could still do this.

1051
02:05:31,232 --> 02:05:33,109
I could still do this.

1052
02:05:34,069 --> 02:05:35,945
One more kill.

1053
02:05:38,198 --> 02:05:40,742
It's the only thing I know how to do.

1054
02:05:41,076 --> 02:05:43,286
Bring pride to my district.

1055
02:05:46,956 --> 02:05:48,750
Not that it matters.

1056
02:06:05,266 --> 02:06:06,434
Please!

1057
02:06:08,186 --> 02:06:09,187
No!

1058
02:06:15,944 --> 02:06:16,945
Please!

1059
02:07:04,492 --> 02:07:06,995
<i>Attention. Attention, Tributes.</i>

1060
02:07:07,162 --> 02:07:10,582
<i>There has been a slight rule change.</i>

1061
02:07:10,707 --> 02:07:12,584
<i>The previous revision,</i>

1062
02:07:12,667 --> 02:07:15,920
<i>allowing for two victors
from the same district,</i>

1063
02:07:16,004 --> 02:07:18,047
<i>has been revoked.</i>

1064
02:07:19,215 --> 02:07:23,344
<i>Only one victor may be crowned. Good luck.</i>

1065
02:07:24,512 --> 02:07:27,515
<i>And may the odds be ever in your favor.</i>

1066
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:43,531
Go ahead.

1067
02:07:47,619 --> 02:07:49,496
One of us should go home.

1068
02:07:50,330 --> 02:07:53,708
One of us has to die.
They have to have their victor.

1069
02:07:54,292 --> 02:07:55,376
No.

1070
02:07:56,586 --> 02:07:58,004
They don't.

1071
02:07:59,839 --> 02:08:01,049
Why should they?

1072
02:08:02,175 --> 02:08:03,885
- No!
- Trust me.

1073
02:08:04,886 --> 02:08:06,137
Trust me.

1074
02:08:25,031 --> 02:08:26,449
Together?

1075
02:08:27,992 --> 02:08:29,244
Together.

1076
02:08:30,495 --> 02:08:31,579
Okay.

1077
02:08:32,664 --> 02:08:33,832

One...

1078
02:08:36,084 --> 02:08:37,335

Two...

1079
02:08:43,424 --> 02:08:44,634

Three.

1080
02:08:46,302 --> 02:08:47,554
<i>Stop!</i>

1081
02:08:48,346 --> 02:08:49,597
<i>Stop!</i>

1082
02:08:53,059 --> 02:08:56,604
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
may I present the winners</i>

1083
02:08:57,480 --> 02:09:00,275
<i>of the 74th Annual Hunger Games.</i>

1084
02:09:27,385 --> 02:09:29,304
<i>They're not happy with you.</i>

1085
02:09:29,971 --> 02:09:32,015
Why? Because I didn't die?

1086
02:09:32,473 --> 02:09:34,267
Because you showed them up.

1087
02:09:35,143 --> 02:09:37,937
Well, I'm sorry
it didn't go the way they planned.

1088
02:09:38,021 --> 02:09:40,231
- I'm not very happy with them either.
- Katniss!

1089
02:09:40,857 --> 02:09:43,985
This is serious. Notjust for you.

1090
02:09:44,402 --> 02:09:46,529
They don't take these things lightly.

1091
02:10:38,414 --> 02:10:40,750
When they ask,
you say you couldn't help yourself.

1092
02:10:40,833 --> 02:10:43,211
You were so in love with this boy

1093
02:10:43,294 --> 02:10:47,382
that the thought of not being with him
was unthinkable.

1094
02:10:47,548 --> 02:10:51,761
You'd rather die than not be with him.
You understand?

1095
02:10:52,261 --> 02:10:56,724
How did you feel
when you found him by that river?

1096
02:11:01,396 --> 02:11:03,648
I felt like the happiest person in the world.

1097
02:11:07,777 --> 02:11:10,321
I couldn't imagine life without him.

1098
02:11:16,995 --> 02:11:18,621
And what about you, Peeta?

1099
02:11:19,747 --> 02:11:21,457
She saved my life.

1100
02:11:21,541 --> 02:11:22,583
We saved each other.

1101
02:11:24,335 --> 02:11:28,840
Ladies and gentlemen,
the star-crossed lovers from District 12,

1102
02:11:28,923 --> 02:11:34,595
this year's victors
of the 74th Annual Hunger Games!

1103
02:11:51,195 --> 02:11:52,697
Congratulations.

1104
02:11:52,780 --> 02:11:54,115
Thank you.

1105
02:11:59,954 --> 02:12:01,372
What a lovely pin.

1106
02:12:01,456 --> 02:12:03,833
Thank you. It's from my district.

1107
02:12:04,584 --> 02:12:06,878
They must be very proud of you.

1108
02:12:19,682 --> 02:12:22,101
So what happens when we get back?

1109
02:12:23,478 --> 02:12:27,398
I don't know. I guess we try to forget.

1110
02:12:32,278 --> 02:12:34,155
I don't want to forget.
