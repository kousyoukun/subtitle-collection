- Yes.

Did any of you experience this as well?

It's about your sister.

We were all very moved, I think, when
you volunteered for her at the Reaping.

Yes.

And what did you say to her in the end?

I told her that I would try to win.

Do I smell like roses to you?

You were so in love with this boy

1275
02:13:57,948 --> 02:14:02,035
that the thought of not being with him
was unthinkable.

1276
02:14:02,202 --> 02:14:06,414
You'd rather die than not be with him.
You understand?

1277
02:14:06,915 --> 02:14:11,378
How did you feel
when you found him by that river?

1278
02:14:16,049 --> 02:14:18,301
I felt like the happiest person in the world.

1279
02:14:22,430 --> 02:14:24,975
I couldn't imagine life without him.

1280
02:14:25,266 --> 02:14:26,309
Oh.

1281
02:14:31,648 --> 02:14:33,274
And what about you, Peeta?

1282
02:14:34,401 --> 02:14:36,111
She saved my life.

1283
02:14:36,194 --> 02:14:37,237
We saved each other.

1284
02:14:38,989 --> 02:14:43,493
CAESAR: Ladies and gentlemen,
the star-crossed lovers from District 12,

1285
02:14:43,576 --> 02:14:49,207
this year's victors
of the 74th Annual Hunger Games!

1286
02:14:49,290 --> 02:14:50,500
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

1287
02:15:05,849 --> 02:15:07,350
PRESIDENT SNOW: Congratulations.

1288
02:15:07,434 --> 02:15:08,768
Thank you.

1289
02:15:14,607 --> 02:15:16,026
What a lovely pin.

1290
02:15:16,109 --> 02:15:18,486
Thank you. It's from my district.

1291
02:15:19,237 --> 02:15:21,531
They must be very proud of you.

1292
02:15:34,335 --> 02:15:36,755
So what happens when we get back?

1293
02:15:38,131 --> 02:15:42,052
I don't know. I guess we try to forget.

1294
02:15:46,931 --> 02:15:48,808
I don't want to forget.

1295
02:15:52,103 --> 02:15:53,813
