1
00:00:58,510 --> 00:00:59,948
I think It's our tradition..

2
00:01:00,334 --> 00:01:01,798
It comes out of a

3
00:01:01,835 --> 00:01:04,168
particularly painful
part of our history.

4
00:01:04,204 --> 00:01:05,344
Yes. Yes.

5
00:01:05,345 --> 00:01:07,430
But it's been a way
we've been able to heal.

6
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:10,748
At first it was a
reminder of the rebellion

7
00:01:10,784 --> 00:01:13,265
It was the price the
Districts had to pay.

8
00:01:13,536 --> 00:01:15,350
But I think it has grown from that.

9
00:01:15,386 --> 00:01:17,434
I think It's a

10
00:01:17,747 --> 00:01:19,517
It's something that
nets us all together.

11
00:01:21,362 --> 00:01:23,717
This is your third year's game?

12
00:01:25,343 --> 00:01:28,072
What defines your personal signature?

13
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:35,747
Shhhh. It's okay.

14
00:01:35,783 --> 00:01:38,191
It's okay.
You're just dreaming.

15
00:01:38,227 --> 00:01:39,478
You're dreaming.

16
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:44,484
I know.

17
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:46,757
I know what It's like.

18
00:01:47,611 --> 00:01:49,347
It's your first..
Prim, your name's gonna

19
00:01:49,348 --> 00:01:51,080
be there once, they're
not gonna pick you!

20
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:54,144
Try to go to sleep.

21
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:55,718
I can't.

22
00:01:56,385 --> 00:01:57,634
Just try.

23
00:01:58,041 --> 00:01:59,291
Just try.

24
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:14,599
Deep in the meadow.

25
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:19,164
Under the willow.

26
00:02:19,675 --> 00:02:23,029
Hop in the grass.

27
00:02:23,446 --> 00:02:27,271
A soft green and pillow.

28
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,615
You remember that song?

29
00:02:30,948 --> 00:02:32,199
Ok.

30
00:02:32,345 --> 00:02:33,303
You finish it.

31
00:02:33,304 --> 00:02:34,225
I gotta go.

32
00:02:34,227 --> 00:02:35,477
Where?

33
00:02:36,014 --> 00:02:37,529
I just gotta go.

34
00:02:37,565 --> 00:02:39,045
But I'll be back.

35
00:02:39,082 --> 00:02:40,358
I love you.

36
00:02:48,945 --> 00:02:50,217
I'll still cook you.

37
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,503
What're you gonna do with
that when you kill it?

38
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:06,682
Damn you, Gale!

39
00:05:07,055 --> 00:05:08,374
It's not funny.

40
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:11,068
What're you gonna do with
a 100 pound deer, Katnip?

41
00:05:11,517 --> 00:05:13,841
It's Reaping Day, the place is
crawling with Peacekeepers.

42
00:05:13,956 --> 00:05:15,204
I was gonna sell it.

43
00:05:15,684 --> 00:05:17,060
From kisskeepers..

44
00:05:17,237 --> 00:05:18,278
Of course you were.

45
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,811
Like you don't sell the Peacekeepers.

46
00:05:19,848 --> 00:05:21,265
No! Not today.

47
00:05:21,302 --> 00:05:23,384
It's the first deer
I've seen in a year.

48
00:05:23,421 --> 00:05:24,285
Now, I have nothing.

49
00:05:24,286 --> 00:05:25,537
Okay.

50
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:18,946
What if they did? Just one you.
Why if everyone just stop watching?

51
00:06:18,982 --> 00:06:19,779
They won't, Gale.

52
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,051
What if they did? What if we did?

53
00:06:21,088 --> 00:06:22,338
Won't happen.

54
00:06:22,427 --> 00:06:25,335
You root for your favorite, you cry
when they get killed. It's sick.

55
00:06:25,372 --> 00:06:26,166
Gale.

56
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:27,313
If no one watches..

57
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,752
Then they don't have a game.
It's as simple as that.

58
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:30,700
What?

59
00:06:30,701 --> 00:06:31,952
Nothing.

60
00:06:32,973 --> 00:06:33,762
Fine, laught at..

61
00:06:33,763 --> 00:06:35,014
I'm not laughing at you.

62
00:06:41,558 --> 00:06:42,975
We could do it, you know?

63
00:06:45,685 --> 00:06:48,197
Take off. Live in the woods.
What we do anyway?

64
00:06:48,234 --> 00:06:49,082
They'd catch us.

65
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,332
Maybe not.

66
00:06:51,301 --> 00:06:53,052
Cut out our tongues or worse.

67
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:54,918
We wouldn't make it five miles.

68
00:06:54,934 --> 00:06:56,184
No, I get five miles.

69
00:06:57,096 --> 00:06:58,345
We'll go that way.

70
00:06:58,554 --> 00:07:00,524
I have Prim. You have your brothers.

71
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,635
They can come too.

72
00:07:01,636 --> 00:07:02,886
Prim in the woods?

73
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,983
Maybe not.

74
00:07:07,901 --> 00:07:09,298
I'm never having kids.

75
00:07:11,153 --> 00:07:12,153
Not might.

76
00:07:12,154 --> 00:07:13,209
If I don't live here.

77
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,248
But you do live here.

78
00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:15,500
I know, but if I didn't.

79
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,084
Oh, I forgot.

80
00:07:20,957 --> 00:07:21,915
Here.

81
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,167
Oh my God!

82
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:24,750
Is this real?

83
00:07:24,751 --> 00:07:25,917
Yeah. Better be.

84
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:27,273
Cost me a squirrel.

85
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:30,112
Happy Hunger Games.

86
00:07:30,148 --> 00:07:32,233
And be the odds be
ever in your favor.

87
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:39,225
How many times did
your name in today?

88
00:07:40,423 --> 00:07:41,674
Forty-two?

89
00:07:42,623 --> 00:07:44,663
I guess the odds aren't
exactly in my favor.

90
00:08:12,581 --> 00:08:13,831
Thank you girl.

91
00:08:22,366 --> 00:08:23,617
What's this?

92
00:08:24,157 --> 00:08:25,939
That's a.. Mocking Jay.

93
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,650
How much?

94
00:08:31,703 --> 00:08:32,669
You keep it.

95
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:33,921
It's yours.

96
00:08:33,942 --> 00:08:35,193
Thank you.

97
00:08:47,302 --> 00:08:48,551
Mom?

98
00:08:50,302 --> 00:08:52,293
Aww. Look at you.

99
00:08:52,678 --> 00:08:54,586
You look beautiful.

100
00:08:54,805 --> 00:08:57,064
Let's better tuck in
that tail by the back.

101
00:08:57,085 --> 00:08:58,795
Made something out for you two.

102
00:09:01,598 --> 00:09:02,849
Okay.

103
00:09:27,554 --> 00:09:29,196
How you look beautiful too.

104
00:09:29,232 --> 00:09:30,837
We should oughta pick you.

105
00:09:31,525 --> 00:09:33,058
Oh no.

106
00:09:33,308 --> 00:09:35,317
Here's how it will
pick you in the back.

107
00:09:41,227 --> 00:09:42,331
Breathe.

108
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,883
Wanna see what I got you today?

109
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,167
It's a Mocking Jay pin.

110
00:09:48,813 --> 00:09:50,064
To protect you.

111
00:09:51,406 --> 00:09:52,678
And as long as you have it.

112
00:09:53,178 --> 00:09:54,888
Nothing bad will happen to you.

113
00:09:55,357 --> 00:09:56,608
Okay?

114
00:09:56,618 --> 00:09:57,869
I promise.

115
00:10:53,545 --> 00:10:54,490
Shh.

116
00:10:54,491 --> 00:10:57,201
Shh. Prim, it's okay. It's okay. Shh.

117
00:10:57,238 --> 00:10:58,895
Okay, it's time to send her now.

118
00:10:58,931 --> 00:11:01,443
Okay, they will prick your finger
to take just a little bit of blood.

119
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,285
I'm scared.

120
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,162
Prim, it doesn't hurt
much. Just a little.

121
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,453
Okay?

122
00:11:05,454 --> 00:11:06,762
Go sit down there
with the little kids.

123
00:11:06,763 --> 00:11:08,070
I'll find you after okay?

124
00:11:08,425 --> 00:11:09,674
Next.

125
00:11:10,424 --> 00:11:11,675
Next.

126
00:11:23,201 --> 00:11:24,294
Go ahead.

127
00:11:24,295 --> 00:11:25,544
Next.

128
00:11:26,138 --> 00:11:27,389
Next.

129
00:11:38,227 --> 00:11:39,477
Next.

130
00:11:41,956 --> 00:11:43,207
Next.

131
00:12:19,075 --> 00:12:20,304
Welcome.

132
00:12:20,305 --> 00:12:22,189
Welcome. Welcome.

133
00:12:23,023 --> 00:12:24,712
Happy Hunger Games.

134
00:12:24,983 --> 00:12:26,139
And..

135
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,577
May the odds be ever in your favor.

136
00:12:31,036 --> 00:12:32,845
Now, before we begin.

137
00:12:32,881 --> 00:12:35,044
We have a very special film.

138
00:12:35,081 --> 00:12:38,831
Brought to you all the
way from the Capitol.

139
00:12:45,948 --> 00:12:47,199
War.

140
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:49,252
Terrible war.

141
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,366
With those..

142
00:12:50,367 --> 00:12:52,825
Orphan.. and motherless child.

143
00:12:53,492 --> 00:12:56,244
This was the uprising
that brought our land.

144
00:12:56,911 --> 00:13:00,390
13 Districts rebel against
the country that fed them.

145
00:13:01,745 --> 00:13:03,121
Protected them.

146
00:13:07,478 --> 00:13:09,091
Then came the peace.

147
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,377
Hard fought.

148
00:13:10,378 --> 00:13:11,380
Solely won.

149
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:12,311
The people.

150
00:13:12,312 --> 00:13:16,062
Rose up from the ashes
and a new era was born.

151
00:13:17,084 --> 00:13:18,918
The freedom has a cost.

152
00:13:19,095 --> 00:13:20,700
And the traitors was defeated.

153
00:13:20,878 --> 00:13:22,545
Peace-War as a nation.

154
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,493
We would never know
this treason again.

155
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,578
And so, it was decreed..

156
00:13:27,776 --> 00:13:28,838
That each year.

157
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:32,527
The various districts of Panem
would offer up in tribute..

158
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:34,165
One young man and woman.

159
00:13:34,202 --> 00:13:35,768
To fight to the death.

160
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:39,716
And it peg you to honor,
courage and sacrifice.

161
00:13:39,753 --> 00:13:41,074
The lone victor..

162
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,361
Bathe in riches..

163
00:13:42,395 --> 00:13:45,835
Will serve as our reminder
of our generosity.

164
00:13:45,871 --> 00:13:47,188
.. and our forgiveness.

165
00:13:47,407 --> 00:13:50,002
This is how we remember our past.

166
00:13:50,544 --> 00:13:53,984
This is how we safe guard our future.

167
00:13:54,202 --> 00:13:55,795
I just love that.

168
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,100
Now, the time has come to..

169
00:14:01,137 --> 00:14:02,329
..select..

170
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:06,445
..one courageous
young man and woman.

171
00:14:07,342 --> 00:14:10,779
For the honor of
representing District

172
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:14,219
12 in the 74th
Annual Hunger Games.

173
00:14:15,501 --> 00:14:16,814
As usual..

174
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,897
..ladies first.

175
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,772
Primrose Everdeen!

176
00:14:53,869 --> 00:14:55,119
Where are you?

177
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,610
Come on up.

178
00:14:58,484 --> 00:14:59,881
Well, come on up!

179
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,681
Prim!

180
00:15:23,848 --> 00:15:25,098
Prim!

181
00:15:25,776 --> 00:15:26,515
No!

182
00:15:26,516 --> 00:15:28,798
I volunteer!

183
00:15:30,287 --> 00:15:31,830
I volunteer as Tribute.

184
00:15:33,716 --> 00:15:35,936
I believe we have a volunteer.

185
00:15:37,654 --> 00:15:40,145
- You need to get out of here.
- No!

186
00:15:40,156 --> 00:15:41,212
- Go find mom!
- No!

187
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,511
- Prim, go find mom!
- No!

188
00:15:42,532 --> 00:15:43,318
I'm so sorry!

189
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:44,227
No!

190
00:15:44,228 --> 00:15:45,477
Noo!

191
00:15:45,772 --> 00:15:48,607
Noo! Nooo! Noooo!

192
00:15:50,055 --> 00:15:52,870
In mad of turn of events
here on District 12.

193
00:15:56,307 --> 00:16:00,080
District 12's very first volunteer.
Big breath.

194
00:16:04,404 --> 00:16:05,655
Come on dear.

195
00:16:15,617 --> 00:16:17,309
What's your name?

196
00:16:17,345 --> 00:16:19,002
Katniss Everdeen.

197
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,004
Well, I bet my hat
that was your sister.

198
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,292
Wasn't it?

199
00:16:23,985 --> 00:16:25,233
Yes.

200
00:16:26,224 --> 00:16:31,456
Let's have a big hand for our very
first volunteer, Katniss Everdeen.

201
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,971
And now..

202
00:16:46,242 --> 00:16:47,639
..for the boys.

203
00:16:57,797 --> 00:16:59,413
Peeta Mellark.

204
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,443
Here we are.

205
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:28,423
Our Tributes from District 12.

206
00:17:29,454 --> 00:17:31,508
Well, go on you two. Shake hands.

207
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,388
Happy Hunger Games.

208
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:50,630
And be the odds be
ever in your favor.

209
00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:04,770
You have 3 minutes.

210
00:18:10,594 --> 00:18:12,674
Prim, Prim, It's okay.

211
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,722
Shh. Prim, I don't have much time.

212
00:18:14,889 --> 00:18:16,283
Prim, listen.

213
00:18:17,232 --> 00:18:18,367
You're gonna be okay.

214
00:18:18,368 --> 00:18:19,791
Don't take any extra food for money.

215
00:18:19,827 --> 00:18:21,985
That doesn't worth putting
your name in more times, okay?

216
00:18:22,021 --> 00:18:23,270
Listen, Prim.

217
00:18:23,296 --> 00:18:25,818
Gale will bring you game.
He stuck cheese from your coat.

218
00:18:27,153 --> 00:18:28,945
Just try to win. Maybe you can.

219
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,342
Maybe I can, I am smart you know?

220
00:18:33,832 --> 00:18:35,145
You can hunt.

221
00:18:35,385 --> 00:18:36,636
Exactly.

222
00:18:42,908 --> 00:18:44,190
It's to protect you.

223
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:51,255
Thank you.

224
00:19:04,613 --> 00:19:06,052
You can't turn out again.

225
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:07,916
I won't

226
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:09,335
No, you can't.

227
00:19:09,512 --> 00:19:10,614
Not like when dad died.

228
00:19:10,615 --> 00:19:12,475
I won't be here anymore.
Your all she has.

229
00:19:12,512 --> 00:19:15,545
No matter what you feel, you will
be there for her. You understand?

230
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,368
Don't cry.

231
00:19:20,963 --> 00:19:22,777
Don't cry. Don't.

232
00:19:26,443 --> 00:19:27,308
It's time.

233
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:29,414
It's okay. Prim, it's okay.

234
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,499
No! No!

235
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:33,667
I promise Prim.

236
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:52,438
I'm fine.

237
00:19:52,474 --> 00:19:53,416
You don't know.

238
00:19:53,417 --> 00:19:54,668
I am.

239
00:19:55,205 --> 00:19:56,607
Listen to me.

240
00:19:56,643 --> 00:19:59,195
You're stronger than they are.
You are.

241
00:19:59,654 --> 00:20:02,520
Get to a bow. What will if you
show them how good you are?

242
00:20:03,031 --> 00:20:04,969
They just want a good show.
That's all they want.

243
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,828
If they don't have a bow,
then you make one.

244
00:20:06,829 --> 00:20:08,136
Okay? You know how to hunt.

245
00:20:08,866 --> 00:20:10,116
They're not animals.

246
00:20:11,992 --> 00:20:13,243
It's no different Katniss.

247
00:20:15,232 --> 00:20:17,608
There's 24 of us Gale
and only one comes out.

248
00:20:18,192 --> 00:20:19,233
Yeah.

249
00:20:19,234 --> 00:20:20,610
And it's gonna be you.

250
00:20:21,111 --> 00:20:21,962
Okay.

251
00:20:21,963 --> 00:20:23,183
Take care of them Gale.

252
00:20:23,184 --> 00:20:24,435
Whatever you do, don't
let them starve.

253
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:25,245
Let's go!

254
00:20:25,246 --> 00:20:26,727
I'll see you soon okay?

255
00:20:29,435 --> 00:20:30,727
You two haven't had trip?

256
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,400
Crystal chandeliers.

257
00:20:32,436 --> 00:20:33,760
Platinum donuts.

258
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:38,716
200 miles per hour and you
can barely feel a thing.

259
00:21:38,752 --> 00:21:41,268
I think It's rather a wonderful
thing is about this opportunity..

260
00:21:41,304 --> 00:21:44,973
That even though you're here and even
though it's just for a little while.

261
00:21:45,108 --> 00:21:48,233
You get to enjoy all of this.

262
00:21:51,246 --> 00:21:53,757
I'm going to find Haymitch.

263
00:21:53,794 --> 00:21:56,267
He's probably in the back car.

264
00:22:07,908 --> 00:22:09,159
You even met him?

265
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:13,649
Haymitch?

266
00:22:18,298 --> 00:22:19,911
You know, Katniss, he is our mentor.

267
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,475
He did witness things once.

268
00:22:28,988 --> 00:22:30,196
Look!

269
00:22:30,197 --> 00:22:32,104
You know if you don't want to talk,
I understand. But I just don't

270
00:22:32,105 --> 00:22:34,012
think there's anything wrong of
getting a little bit of help.

271
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:00,926
Congratulations.

272
00:23:20,121 --> 00:23:21,372
Where's the ice?

273
00:23:23,913 --> 00:23:25,466
I don't.. I don't know.

274
00:23:36,961 --> 00:23:38,887
Okay, so uh..

275
00:23:39,825 --> 00:23:41,264
..so when do we start?

276
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,107
Whoah.

277
00:23:42,108 --> 00:23:43,682
Why so eager?

278
00:23:44,192 --> 00:23:47,276
Most of you are in such a hurry.

279
00:23:47,922 --> 00:23:49,042
Yeah.
I wanna know what the plan is.

280
00:23:49,043 --> 00:23:50,198
You're our mentor,
you're supposed to go..

281
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:51,450
Encore.

282
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,799
Yeah.

283
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,664
Our mentor is supposed to tell us how
to get sponsors and give us advice.

284
00:23:55,956 --> 00:23:57,749
Oh, okay.

285
00:23:58,176 --> 00:23:59,427
Ummm..

286
00:23:59,656 --> 00:24:03,938
Embrace the probability
of your immanent death.

287
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,971
I know.

288
00:24:05,981 --> 00:24:07,253
Can your heart..

289
00:24:07,888 --> 00:24:10,461
that there's nothing I
can do to save you.

290
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,348
So why are you here then?

291
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,037
The refreshments.

292
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,434
Okay, I think that's enough.

293
00:24:21,976 --> 00:24:24,071
You made me spill my drink.

294
00:24:24,108 --> 00:24:25,862
Over my new pants.

295
00:24:26,946 --> 00:24:27,883
You know..

296
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:31,407
I think I'll go finish
this in my room.

297
00:24:46,881 --> 00:24:48,716
I shouldn't have come around.

298
00:24:48,752 --> 00:24:50,069
What? It's no use.

299
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:51,403
I'm gonna go talk to him.

300
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:02,126
We have two.. 16 year olds.

301
00:25:05,512 --> 00:25:06,762
Yes.

302
00:25:06,867 --> 00:25:08,764
Do you remember this year?

303
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,661
Aww. One of my favorite years.

304
00:25:10,692 --> 00:25:12,177
And one of my favorite arenas.

305
00:25:12,214 --> 00:25:14,963
The use of the rubble, the ruin city.

306
00:25:15,766 --> 00:25:16,880
Very exciting.

307
00:25:16,881 --> 00:25:18,434
From this moment here..

308
00:25:18,471 --> 00:25:19,402
..this moment..

309
00:25:19,403 --> 00:25:21,486
.. is the moment that
you never forget.

310
00:25:21,523 --> 00:25:22,465
The moment..

311
00:25:22,466 --> 00:25:23,717
..when a Tribute..

312
00:25:24,113 --> 00:25:25,624
..becomes a victor.

313
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,256
You'd freeze to death first.

314
00:26:02,293 --> 00:26:03,736
Because I didn't light a fire.

315
00:26:03,773 --> 00:26:05,492
Now that's a good
way to get killed.

316
00:26:05,529 --> 00:26:07,212
What's a good way to get killed?

317
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,639
Oh! Joy.

318
00:26:09,785 --> 00:26:11,473
Why don't you join us?

319
00:26:12,234 --> 00:26:14,913
I'm just saving a life-saving advice.

320
00:26:16,464 --> 00:26:17,693
Like what?

321
00:26:17,694 --> 00:26:19,997
I wa.. I was just asking
bout how to find shelter.

322
00:26:20,466 --> 00:26:24,550
Which would come in handy if
in fact you are still alive.

323
00:26:26,614 --> 00:26:28,011
How do you find shelter?

324
00:26:28,834 --> 00:26:30,236
Pass the jam.

325
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,907
How do you find shelter?

326
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,127
Give me a chance to
wake up sweetheart.

327
00:26:36,086 --> 00:26:37,858
This mentoring is very..

328
00:26:38,546 --> 00:26:40,191
..tax and stuff.

329
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,579
Can you pass the marmalade?

330
00:26:48,913 --> 00:26:50,925
That is mahogany.

331
00:26:51,456 --> 00:26:52,633
Look at you!

332
00:26:52,634 --> 00:26:55,146
Just killed a.. place mat!

333
00:26:56,582 --> 00:26:58,625
You really wanna know
how to stay alive?

334
00:27:00,199 --> 00:27:02,669
You get people to like you.

335
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:04,940
Oh!

336
00:27:05,065 --> 00:27:06,951
Not what you're expecting.

337
00:27:08,463 --> 00:27:10,672
When you're in the
middle of the games..

338
00:27:10,709 --> 00:27:13,474
..and you're starving or freezing,

339
00:27:13,511 --> 00:27:14,813
some water,

340
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,445
a knife or even some
matches can mean

341
00:27:17,446 --> 00:27:20,039
the difference between
life and death.

342
00:27:20,216 --> 00:27:23,061
And those things only
comes from Sponsors.

343
00:27:23,551 --> 00:27:28,385
And to get Sponsors, you have
to make people like you.

344
00:27:29,251 --> 00:27:31,241
And right now, sweetheart?

345
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,691
You're not off to a
really good start.

346
00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:36,638
There it is.

347
00:27:41,944 --> 00:27:43,193
It's huge.

348
00:27:44,047 --> 00:27:45,757
That's incredible.

349
00:28:20,572 --> 00:28:23,071
Come on.

350
00:28:27,678 --> 00:28:29,315
Better keep this knife.

351
00:28:29,763 --> 00:28:31,199
He knows what he's doing.

352
00:28:42,141 --> 00:28:43,929
So now that you've seen..

353
00:28:43,965 --> 00:28:46,684
..what do you think of
this years cropful troops?

354
00:28:46,757 --> 00:28:49,415
Are there any surprises that
we can expect this year?

355
00:28:50,217 --> 00:28:52,573
It's really hard to tell from
a Reaping but I think..

356
00:28:53,302 --> 00:28:54,697
..this is a very interesting mix.

357
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:55,561
Yes.

358
00:28:55,562 --> 00:28:57,803
Whenever you have a volunteer
from an outline district,

359
00:28:57,876 --> 00:28:59,533
it's something you can't ignore.

360
00:29:27,563 --> 00:29:28,814
What's that?

361
00:29:29,585 --> 00:29:30,836
What's that?

362
00:29:31,493 --> 00:29:33,252
We were just saying
we might need to hose

363
00:29:33,253 --> 00:29:35,014
you down again before
we take you to Cinna.

364
00:29:41,901 --> 00:29:44,674
That was all the bravest
thing I've ever seen.

365
00:29:46,508 --> 00:29:47,544
I am Cinna.

366
00:29:47,545 --> 00:29:48,780
Katniss.

367
00:29:48,781 --> 00:29:50,733
I'm sorry that this happened to you.

368
00:29:50,769 --> 00:29:52,854
And I'm here to help
you in any way I can.

369
00:29:55,387 --> 00:29:57,407
Most people just congratulate me.

370
00:29:57,626 --> 00:29:59,293
I don't see the point in that.

371
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:02,650
So tonight..

372
00:30:02,775 --> 00:30:04,130
..they have the Tribute Parade.

373
00:30:04,711 --> 00:30:06,817
Let me take you out and
show you after the wurl.

374
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:09,766
So you're here to
make me look pretty.

375
00:30:09,803 --> 00:30:11,476
I'm here to help you
make an impression.

376
00:30:12,383 --> 00:30:15,132
Now usually, they dress people in
their close to their district.

377
00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:16,351
Yeah. We're called minors.

378
00:30:16,352 --> 00:30:17,623
Yeah. But I don't want to do that.

379
00:30:18,885 --> 00:30:20,769
I'm gonna do something that
they're gonna remember.

380
00:30:21,374 --> 00:30:23,396
Did they explain about
trying to get sponsors?

381
00:30:24,105 --> 00:30:26,293
Yeah, but I'm not very
good at making friends.

382
00:30:26,648 --> 00:30:27,899
We'll see.

383
00:30:29,783 --> 00:30:31,930
I just think, somebody that brave..

384
00:30:33,181 --> 00:30:35,839
..shouldn't be dressed up on some
stupid costume as should they.

385
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:40,882
I hope not.

386
00:30:50,125 --> 00:30:53,500
It's not real fire. These suIt's are
built so you won't feel a thing.

387
00:30:53,896 --> 00:30:55,147
That's better on me.

388
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,481
The idea..

389
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,950
You ready?

390
00:30:57,961 --> 00:30:58,950
Don't be afraid.

391
00:30:58,951 --> 00:31:00,200
I'm not afraid.

392
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:23,257
Over one hundred
thousand people, craning

393
00:31:23,258 --> 00:31:26,053
to get a glimpse this
year's Tributes..

394
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:29,138
..and the Sponsors get to see
the Tributes for the first time.

395
00:31:29,175 --> 00:31:32,045
The importance of this moment
cannot be over stated.

396
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,611
They're nice.

397
00:31:38,809 --> 00:31:40,985
First cheered on my counting in 15..

398
00:31:41,022 --> 00:31:43,675
..14.. 13..

399
00:31:46,207 --> 00:31:47,998
Here they are. Here they are.

400
00:31:48,035 --> 00:31:49,635
This year's Tributes.

401
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:51,709
The most exciting run..

402
00:31:51,834 --> 00:31:53,934
..it just gives you goosebumps.

403
00:31:53,971 --> 00:31:55,996
Don't you love, how the stylist..

404
00:31:56,032 --> 00:31:58,216
..they so clearly
are able to reflect

405
00:31:58,217 --> 00:32:00,400
the character of each district.

406
00:32:01,848 --> 00:32:03,107
There's District 4!

407
00:32:03,973 --> 00:32:04,774
Fishing.

408
00:32:04,775 --> 00:32:05,988
I get it. I like it.

409
00:32:05,989 --> 00:32:07,240
That's very good.

410
00:32:08,236 --> 00:32:09,277
And behind them..

411
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:13,112
.. we have two power plant workers.

412
00:32:13,148 --> 00:32:14,399
And then..

413
00:32:15,248 --> 00:32:17,072
..what is that in the background?

414
00:32:44,466 --> 00:32:45,738
Come on. They'll love it.

415
00:32:53,793 --> 00:32:55,487
Now see that? I love that.

416
00:32:55,523 --> 00:32:57,790
Two young people,
holding their hands up!

417
00:32:57,827 --> 00:32:59,758
Saying, "I'm proud,
I'm from District 12!

418
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:01,692
We will not be overlooked!"

419
00:33:01,775 --> 00:33:03,052
I love that.

420
00:33:03,088 --> 00:33:06,286
We're gonna sure we'll be paying
attention to them right now!

421
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,747
And we're ready.

422
00:33:10,226 --> 00:33:12,008
President Snow, you're live!

423
00:33:41,946 --> 00:33:43,196
Welcome.

424
00:33:46,936 --> 00:33:48,281
Welcome.

425
00:33:49,657 --> 00:33:50,907
Tributes.

426
00:33:51,814 --> 00:33:53,086
We welcome you.

427
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:56,034
We salute..

428
00:33:56,544 --> 00:33:57,795
..the courage..

429
00:33:58,473 --> 00:34:00,005
..and your sacrifice.

430
00:34:04,234 --> 00:34:05,704
And we wish you..

431
00:34:07,705 --> 00:34:09,392
..happy Hunger Games.

432
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:14,645
And may the odds be
ever in your favor.

433
00:34:26,336 --> 00:34:28,363
That was amazing.

434
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,641
Oh, we are anybody's
going be talking about.

435
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,119
So brave.

436
00:34:33,192 --> 00:34:35,256
Are you sure you're
spinning up a new flame?

437
00:34:35,391 --> 00:34:36,642
Fake flame?

438
00:34:37,059 --> 00:34:38,435
Are you sure?

439
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,292
That's uh..

440
00:34:47,595 --> 00:34:49,083
..let's go upstairs.

441
00:34:53,836 --> 00:34:56,997
So each of the districts
got their own floor and

442
00:34:56,998 --> 00:35:00,161
because you're from 12,
you get the penthouse.

443
00:35:06,767 --> 00:35:08,018
Come on.

444
00:35:12,049 --> 00:35:14,186
So this is the living room.

445
00:35:14,864 --> 00:35:17,261
I know!

446
00:35:17,886 --> 00:35:20,240
Now, your rooms are right over here.

447
00:35:20,553 --> 00:35:25,139
Why don't you go clean yourselves
up a little before dinner.

448
00:36:41,717 --> 00:36:42,968
In two weeks..

449
00:36:43,177 --> 00:36:45,376
..23 of you will be dead.

450
00:36:45,939 --> 00:36:47,771
One of you will be alive.

451
00:36:47,907 --> 00:36:50,236
Who that is depends
on how well you pay

452
00:36:50,237 --> 00:36:52,566
attention over the
next four days.

453
00:36:52,701 --> 00:36:54,878
Particularly to what
I'm about to say.

454
00:36:55,034 --> 00:36:57,947
First. No fighting with
the other Tributes.

455
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:00,496
You'll have plenty of time
for that in the arena.

456
00:37:00,694 --> 00:37:05,080
There are four compulsory exercises,
the rest will be individual training.

457
00:37:05,116 --> 00:37:06,236
My advice is..

458
00:37:06,237 --> 00:37:08,201
Don't ignore the survival skills.

459
00:37:08,238 --> 00:37:10,664
Everybody wants to
grab a sword but most

460
00:37:10,665 --> 00:37:13,093
of you wil die from
natural causes.

461
00:37:13,129 --> 00:37:14,898
10% from infection.

462
00:37:14,935 --> 00:37:16,668
20% from dehydration.

463
00:37:16,845 --> 00:37:19,522
Exposure can kill as
easily as a knife.

464
00:37:52,034 --> 00:37:53,138
Where's my knife?

465
00:37:53,368 --> 00:37:54,159
Where did you put it?

466
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:54,941
I put my knife..

467
00:37:54,942 --> 00:37:56,193
Don't touch me..

468
00:37:56,318 --> 00:37:57,869
Fuck! You took my knife!

469
00:37:57,962 --> 00:37:59,974
I didn't touch your knife.
I didn't touch your kni..

470
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:00,932
You liar.

471
00:38:00,933 --> 00:38:02,011
You little punk!

472
00:38:02,012 --> 00:38:03,263
You took my knife.

473
00:38:03,508 --> 00:38:04,392
Get off me.

474
00:38:04,393 --> 00:38:05,642
Just sit here.

475
00:38:07,748 --> 00:38:09,598
I should better wait for the arena.

476
00:38:09,634 --> 00:38:11,719
You're the first one I get
so watch your back huh!

477
00:38:14,646 --> 00:38:15,943
Everybody back in line.

478
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,377
You know you're next to me Cato!

479
00:38:17,908 --> 00:38:19,190
Busy career.

480
00:38:19,305 --> 00:38:20,362
You know what that is?

481
00:38:20,363 --> 00:38:21,465
From District 1.

482
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:22,429
..and 2.

483
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:24,962
They've been trying to be
in a special academy till

484
00:38:24,964 --> 00:38:27,495
they're 18 and they volunteer.
By that point..

485
00:38:28,246 --> 00:38:29,243
..they're pretty lethal.

486
00:38:29,244 --> 00:38:31,803
But they don't receive
any special treatment.

487
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,393
In fact, they're staying at the
exact same apartment as you do.

488
00:38:34,529 --> 00:38:37,216
And I don't think left them
out for dessert and you can.

489
00:38:38,435 --> 00:38:39,947
So how good all that?

490
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:43,152
Obviously, they're pretty good.

491
00:38:43,153 --> 00:38:44,917
They won in almost
several year but..

492
00:38:44,953 --> 00:38:46,204
Almost..

493
00:38:46,397 --> 00:38:47,866
They can be arrogant.

494
00:38:48,773 --> 00:38:52,630
And arrogance can
be a big problem.

495
00:38:54,827 --> 00:38:56,078
I hear you can shoot..

496
00:38:59,121 --> 00:39:00,372
I'm alright.

497
00:39:00,382 --> 00:39:01,798
Actually, better than alright.

498
00:39:02,069 --> 00:39:03,601
I fed her by the squirrels.

499
00:39:04,602 --> 00:39:07,103
He say she hIt's em right
in the eye, everytime.

500
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,614
- Peeta's strong.
- What?

501
00:39:10,624 --> 00:39:12,167
He can throw a 100
pound sack of flour

502
00:39:12,168 --> 00:39:13,501
right in his head. I've seen it.

503
00:39:13,537 --> 00:39:15,997
Okay, well I cannot kill
anybody by a sack of flour.

504
00:39:16,034 --> 00:39:17,616
No, you might have a
better chance at winning

505
00:39:17,617 --> 00:39:19,200
when somebody comes
after you with a knife.

506
00:39:19,237 --> 00:39:22,150
I have no chance of winning.
None! Alright?

507
00:39:27,234 --> 00:39:28,746
It's true.

508
00:39:29,277 --> 00:39:30,528
Everybody knows it.

509
00:39:33,184 --> 00:39:34,601
You know what my mother said?

510
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:38,197
She said, "District 12 might
finally have a winner!"

511
00:39:39,531 --> 00:39:41,072
But she wasn't talking about me.

512
00:39:42,636 --> 00:39:43,886
She was talking about you.

513
00:39:50,023 --> 00:39:51,378
I'm not very hungry.

514
00:40:29,537 --> 00:40:30,872
I'm done too.

515
00:41:14,002 --> 00:41:15,491
Throw that metal
thing over there.

516
00:41:15,866 --> 00:41:17,117
What?

517
00:41:19,671 --> 00:41:20,597
No.

518
00:41:20,598 --> 00:41:22,037
Haymitch says we're not
supposed to show..

519
00:41:22,073 --> 00:41:23,322
I don't care what Haymitch said.

520
00:41:23,327 --> 00:41:25,474
Those guys are looking at
you like you're a meal.

521
00:41:25,787 --> 00:41:27,038
Throw it.

522
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:12,678
Hi.

523
00:42:13,627 --> 00:42:14,606
Hey.

524
00:42:14,607 --> 00:42:15,857
How did you do that?

525
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:18,159
I uh..

526
00:42:18,242 --> 00:42:20,348
I used to take care of the
cakes down at the bakery.

527
00:42:21,557 --> 00:42:22,808
I'll show you.

528
00:42:25,101 --> 00:42:26,349
See?

529
00:42:27,121 --> 00:42:28,079
Wow.

530
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,330
Yeah.

531
00:42:30,852 --> 00:42:32,718
I think you have a shadow.

532
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:01,290
Tomorrow.
They will bring you in one by one.

533
00:43:01,404 --> 00:43:02,864
And evaluate you.

534
00:43:03,374 --> 00:43:07,062
This is important because high
ratings will mean Sponsors.

535
00:43:07,099 --> 00:43:09,722
This is the time to
show them everything.

536
00:43:09,758 --> 00:43:12,347
There'll be a bow,
make sure you use it.

537
00:43:12,472 --> 00:43:14,585
Peeta, you make sure
to show your strength.

538
00:43:15,023 --> 00:43:19,130
They'll start with District 1
so the two of you will go last.

539
00:43:19,974 --> 00:43:21,791
Not on my house to put this..

540
00:43:21,827 --> 00:43:23,610
Make sure they remember you!

541
00:43:35,042 --> 00:43:37,239
Katniss Everdeen.

542
00:43:48,734 --> 00:43:49,984
Hey Katniss.

543
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:52,246
Shoot straight.

544
00:44:52,788 --> 00:44:54,435
Katniss Everdeen.

545
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:57,299
District 12.

546
00:46:48,484 --> 00:46:49,735
Thank you.

547
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:51,507
For your consideration.

548
00:46:56,915 --> 00:46:58,071
Are you crazy?

549
00:46:58,072 --> 00:46:59,191
I just got mad.

550
00:46:59,192 --> 00:47:00,443
Mad?!

551
00:47:01,115 --> 00:47:04,865
You realize that your actions
reflect badly on all of us.

552
00:47:04,902 --> 00:47:06,146
Not just you.

553
00:47:06,147 --> 00:47:07,596
They just want a good
show, it's fine.

554
00:47:07,794 --> 00:47:09,741
How bout just bad manners Cinna?

555
00:47:09,778 --> 00:47:11,138
How bout that?

556
00:47:11,524 --> 00:47:13,077
Well, finally!

557
00:47:13,296 --> 00:47:16,297
I hope you notice, we
have a serious situation.

558
00:47:19,485 --> 00:47:21,590
Nice shooting sweetheart!

559
00:47:22,945 --> 00:47:25,377
Wha.. Wha.. What did they..

560
00:47:25,378 --> 00:47:27,811
What did they do when
you shot the apple?

561
00:47:28,228 --> 00:47:29,843
Well, they look pretty startled.

562
00:47:33,291 --> 00:47:36,064
What did you say.. "Thanks for.. "

563
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,148
..consideration. Genius!

564
00:47:38,993 --> 00:47:39,784
Genius.

565
00:47:39,785 --> 00:47:42,118
How do you think you're
gonna find this funny?

566
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:44,452
If the game makers decided
to take it out..

567
00:47:44,489 --> 00:47:46,089
On who? On her?

568
00:47:46,714 --> 00:47:47,933
On him?

569
00:47:47,934 --> 00:47:49,308
I think they already have.

570
00:47:49,464 --> 00:47:52,080
Loosen your corset and have a drink.

571
00:47:52,372 --> 00:47:55,186
I would have given
anything to see it.

572
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:58,738
As you know the Tributes
are rated on a scale of

573
00:47:58,739 --> 00:48:01,740
1 to 12 after three days
of careful evaluation.

574
00:48:01,886 --> 00:48:04,315
The game keepers would
like to evaluate..

575
00:48:06,064 --> 00:48:09,107
From District 1, Marvel.

576
00:48:09,144 --> 00:48:12,026
The score of 9.

577
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:14,536
Cato, the score of 10.

578
00:48:14,577 --> 00:48:16,995
Clove, the score of 10.

579
00:48:17,871 --> 00:48:20,174
Four, score of..

580
00:48:20,268 --> 00:48:21,616
From District 7..

581
00:48:21,653 --> 00:48:22,966
From District..

582
00:48:24,008 --> 00:48:26,760
Rue, the score of 7.

583
00:48:28,738 --> 00:48:30,114
From District 12..

584
00:48:31,625 --> 00:48:35,107
Peeta Mellark..

585
00:48:37,054 --> 00:48:38,304
The score of..

586
00:48:38,836 --> 00:48:40,087
8.

587
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,891
Not bad. Bravo.

588
00:48:48,131 --> 00:48:49,549
And finally..

589
00:48:51,861 --> 00:48:53,476
From District 12..

590
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:56,989
Katniss Everdeen..

591
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,511
With the score of..

592
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:06,941
..eleven.

593
00:49:12,724 --> 00:49:14,100
Congratulations.

594
00:49:14,558 --> 00:49:15,895
I thought they hated me.

595
00:49:15,932 --> 00:49:17,485
They must have like you girl.

596
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:19,215
To Katniss Everdeen..

597
00:49:19,252 --> 00:49:21,842
The Girl On Fire!

598
00:49:24,539 --> 00:49:25,790
At eleven?

599
00:49:26,186 --> 00:49:27,207
She earned it.

600
00:49:27,208 --> 00:49:29,365
She shot an arrow at your head.

601
00:49:29,402 --> 00:49:30,652
Well, t'was an apple.

602
00:49:30,681 --> 00:49:31,929
..near your head.

603
00:49:32,772 --> 00:49:34,022
Sit down.

604
00:49:39,346 --> 00:49:40,597
Seneca..

605
00:49:41,369 --> 00:49:43,182
..why do you think we have a winner?

606
00:49:44,912 --> 00:49:46,163
What do you mean?

607
00:49:47,068 --> 00:49:48,558
I mean..

608
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,508
..why do we have a winner?

609
00:49:53,593 --> 00:49:55,531
I mean if we just
wanted to intimidate

610
00:49:55,533 --> 00:49:57,473
the Districts, why not round up

611
00:49:57,474 --> 00:50:01,356
24 of them at random and execute
them all at once. Way a lot faster..

612
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:05,471
Hope.

613
00:50:06,367 --> 00:50:07,618
Hope?

614
00:50:07,837 --> 00:50:09,088
Hope.

615
00:50:09,254 --> 00:50:13,119
It is the only thing..
stronger than fear.

616
00:50:13,807 --> 00:50:15,605
A little hope is effective.

617
00:50:15,642 --> 00:50:17,403
A lot of hope is dangerous.

618
00:50:17,862 --> 00:50:21,310
It's track is fine..
As long as it's contained.

619
00:50:24,082 --> 00:50:25,333
So..

620
00:50:25,875 --> 00:50:29,229
So.. contain it!

621
00:50:31,356 --> 00:50:32,606
Right.

622
00:50:32,982 --> 00:50:36,242
If she's staring at all my jewels,
she can't take her eye from..

623
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,290
Frankly.. it was rude.

624
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:40,813
Oh, Haymitch.
You should join us.

625
00:50:40,814 --> 00:50:43,296
We're having some of
your favorite dish.

626
00:50:43,672 --> 00:50:45,110
Oh, lovely.

627
00:50:48,883 --> 00:50:49,841
Where's Peeta?

628
00:50:49,842 --> 00:50:52,613
He's in his room. Now listen..

629
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,536
Tomorrow's the last day.

630
00:50:54,572 --> 00:50:57,464
When they let us walk with
our own Tributes right

631
00:50:57,466 --> 00:51:00,355
before the game so you and
I will be going down at 9.

632
00:51:02,023 --> 00:51:03,273
Well, what about him?

633
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:07,170
No, he says he wants to be
trained on his own from now on.

634
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:09,890
What?

635
00:51:10,296 --> 00:51:13,048
It's kind of thing does happen
at this point if there's..

636
00:51:13,963 --> 00:51:15,537
..only one winner. Right?

637
00:51:21,841 --> 00:51:23,790
We should have some
chocolate covered stoke.

638
00:51:28,699 --> 00:51:32,293
Ladies and gentlemen.
Your master of ceremonies..

639
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:37,098
Caesar Flickerman!

640
00:51:40,213 --> 00:51:41,985
Thank you!

641
00:51:43,027 --> 00:51:46,512
Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome.

642
00:51:46,548 --> 00:51:49,998
To the 74th Annual Hunger Games.

643
00:51:50,134 --> 00:51:54,186
Now, there are five minutes they
are all going to be out here.

644
00:51:54,384 --> 00:51:57,271
All of the Tributes
that you heard about.

645
00:51:57,308 --> 00:51:59,097
Are you excited?

646
00:51:59,134 --> 00:52:00,888
Let me hear it!

647
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:05,472
Amazing.

648
00:52:07,328 --> 00:52:08,787
I don't feel amazing.

649
00:52:08,901 --> 00:52:10,531
Don't you know how
beautiful you look?

650
00:52:10,567 --> 00:52:12,329
No. And I don't know
how to make people

651
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:14,090
like me, how do you
make people like you?

652
00:52:14,163 --> 00:52:15,163
Why do you made me like you?

653
00:52:15,164 --> 00:52:16,892
That's different.
I wasn't trying.

654
00:52:16,954 --> 00:52:18,016
Exactly.

655
00:52:18,018 --> 00:52:21,082
Just be yourself.
I'll be there the whole time.

656
00:52:21,118 --> 00:52:23,166
..and just pretend
you're talking to me.

657
00:52:23,437 --> 00:52:24,686
Okay?

658
00:52:25,124 --> 00:52:25,915
Okay.

659
00:52:25,916 --> 00:52:28,657
Let's see if she
does indeed shine.

660
00:52:28,658 --> 00:52:31,399
Let's have a warm round
of applause for Glimmer.

661
00:52:35,931 --> 00:52:37,640
Glimmer, are you prepared?

662
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:39,412
Yes Caesar, I am prepared.

663
00:52:39,448 --> 00:52:40,984
I like it, that's just..

664
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:49,039
Big round of applause.

665
00:52:51,394 --> 00:52:52,645
Marvel!

666
00:52:55,386 --> 00:52:57,135
Welcome Clove.

667
00:52:57,188 --> 00:52:58,532
It's an honor to
represent my district.

668
00:52:58,569 --> 00:52:59,355
So you're a fighter?

669
00:52:59,356 --> 00:53:01,805
I'm prepared, vicious
and I'm ready to go.

670
00:53:02,868 --> 00:53:04,117
Cato!

671
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,512
From District 12..

672
00:53:30,669 --> 00:53:32,831
You know her..

673
00:53:32,868 --> 00:53:37,431
..as the girl on fire!

674
00:53:37,525 --> 00:53:41,673
Where we know it's Katniss Everdeen!

675
00:54:10,412 --> 00:54:11,663
What?

676
00:54:13,007 --> 00:54:14,800
I think someone's a little nervous.

677
00:54:16,935 --> 00:54:19,317
I said that was quite and
entrance that you've

678
00:54:19,318 --> 00:54:21,698
made at the Tribute's
Parade the other day.

679
00:54:21,735 --> 00:54:22,983
Do you want to tell us about it?

680
00:54:24,604 --> 00:54:25,990
Well, I was just..

681
00:54:26,293 --> 00:54:28,315
..hoping that I
wouldn't burned it up!

682
00:54:36,724 --> 00:54:38,350
When you came out of that chariot..

683
00:54:38,387 --> 00:54:39,635
I have to say..

684
00:54:39,828 --> 00:54:42,027
My heart.. stopped.

685
00:54:42,163 --> 00:54:44,560
To earn you experiences as well.

686
00:54:44,977 --> 00:54:46,228
My heart stopped.

687
00:54:49,134 --> 00:54:50,499
So did mine.

688
00:54:53,126 --> 00:54:55,115
Now tell me bout the flames..
are they real?

689
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,085
Yes.

690
00:55:01,577 --> 00:55:03,378
In fact I'm wearing them today.

691
00:55:04,222 --> 00:55:05,473
Would you like to see?

692
00:55:06,411 --> 00:55:07,662
Wait, wait, wait.

693
00:55:08,141 --> 00:55:09,392
Is it safe?

694
00:55:10,985 --> 00:55:12,277
What do you think folks?

695
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:15,561
I think that's a yes!

696
00:55:49,302 --> 00:55:50,791
That was really something.

697
00:55:50,853 --> 00:55:52,875
Katniss, that was something.

698
00:55:53,584 --> 00:55:54,960
Thank you for that.

699
00:55:57,201 --> 00:55:58,825
I have one more question for you.

700
00:56:00,889 --> 00:56:02,515
It's about your sister..

701
00:56:05,173 --> 00:56:08,297
We are all very moved,
I think when..

702
00:56:09,038 --> 00:56:11,497
..you volunteered for
her at the Reaping.

703
00:56:13,601 --> 00:56:15,196
Does she come to say goodbye to you.

704
00:56:16,238 --> 00:56:17,489
Yes.

705
00:56:17,728 --> 00:56:19,354
She did.

706
00:56:21,989 --> 00:56:23,699
And what did you say to her?

707
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:25,398
In the end?

708
00:56:28,097 --> 00:56:30,138
I told her that I would try to win.

709
00:56:31,931 --> 00:56:33,838
That I will try to win for her.

710
00:56:35,256 --> 00:56:36,809
Of course you did.

711
00:56:38,881 --> 00:56:40,361
And try you will.

712
00:56:41,581 --> 00:56:44,831
Ladies and gentlemen,
from District 12,

713
00:56:44,832 --> 00:56:48,083
Katniss Everdeen,
The Girl On Fire!

714
00:56:54,115 --> 00:56:55,297
You did it darling.

715
00:56:55,298 --> 00:56:56,470
That was incredible.

716
00:56:56,471 --> 00:56:57,722
Thank you.

717
00:56:58,076 --> 00:57:00,421
Nice job sweetheart.

718
00:57:01,107 --> 00:57:02,326
Thank you.

719
00:57:02,327 --> 00:57:04,088
Nice dress too.

720
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:06,746
Are yours?

721
00:57:06,783 --> 00:57:08,568
Peeta Mellark!

722
00:57:14,874 --> 00:57:16,936
Peeta, welcome.

723
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:19,906
How are you finding the Capitol?
Don't say with a map.

724
00:57:21,241 --> 00:57:22,700
Uh, it's uh.. different.

725
00:57:22,736 --> 00:57:23,970
It's very different.

726
00:57:23,971 --> 00:57:26,335
Different? In what are?
Give us an example.

727
00:57:26,825 --> 00:57:29,514
Uh okay, well the
showers here are weird.

728
00:57:29,587 --> 00:57:30,347
Showers?

729
00:57:30,348 --> 00:57:31,139
Yes.

730
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:32,384
We have different showers.

731
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:34,104
I have a question for you Caesar.

732
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:35,787
Do I smell like roses to you?

733
00:57:38,184 --> 00:57:39,435
Um..

734
00:57:41,622 --> 00:57:42,387
Do I?

735
00:57:42,388 --> 00:57:43,184
Yeah.

736
00:57:43,185 --> 00:57:44,447
Do I smell like it?

737
00:57:50,792 --> 00:57:52,147
You definitely smell
better than I do.

738
00:57:52,184 --> 00:57:53,434
Well I live here longer.

739
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:01,129
So Peeta..

740
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:02,381
..tell me.

741
00:58:02,599 --> 00:58:04,682
Is there a special girl back home?

742
00:58:05,109 --> 00:58:07,283
No, not really.

743
00:58:07,319 --> 00:58:10,222
No? I don't believe it for a second.

744
00:58:10,258 --> 00:58:13,362
Look at that face.
Handsome man like you.. Peeta.

745
00:58:14,717 --> 00:58:15,968
Tell me.

746
00:58:17,803 --> 00:58:19,105
Well, there a..

747
00:58:19,771 --> 00:58:21,381
There's this one girl that..

748
00:58:21,417 --> 00:58:22,991
I had a crush on forever.

749
00:58:24,211 --> 00:58:28,024
But I don't think she actually
recognize me until the Reaping.

750
00:58:30,556 --> 00:58:31,712
Well..

751
00:58:31,713 --> 00:58:33,193
I'll tell you what Peeta.

752
00:58:34,507 --> 00:58:35,755
You go out there..

753
00:58:36,548 --> 00:58:37,923
..and you win this thing.

754
00:58:38,257 --> 00:58:39,617
And when you get home.

755
00:58:39,654 --> 00:58:41,582
She'll have to go out with you.

756
00:58:42,155 --> 00:58:43,404
Right folks?

757
00:58:46,645 --> 00:58:48,256
Thanks but I uh..

758
00:58:48,257 --> 00:58:49,866
I don't think winnings
gonna help me at all.

759
00:58:50,189 --> 00:58:51,438
And why not?

760
00:58:55,055 --> 00:58:56,608
Because she came here with me.

761
00:59:01,307 --> 00:59:02,953
Well, that's bad luck.

762
00:59:04,037 --> 00:59:05,330
Yeah. It is.

763
00:59:07,121 --> 00:59:09,122
And I wish you all the best of luck.

764
00:59:09,362 --> 00:59:10,612
Thank you.

765
00:59:11,071 --> 00:59:12,322
Peeta Mellark.

766
00:59:13,625 --> 00:59:14,915
District 12!

767
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:20,538
What the hell is that?!

768
00:59:20,575 --> 00:59:22,725
You don't talk to me and you
say you have a crush on me?

769
00:59:22,762 --> 00:59:24,877
You say you wanna train alone..
is that how you wanna play?

770
00:59:24,914 --> 00:59:26,360
Stop! Stop it!

771
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,806
Start right now.

772
00:59:29,557 --> 00:59:30,623
He did you a favor.

773
00:59:30,624 --> 00:59:31,618
He made me look weak.

774
00:59:31,619 --> 00:59:33,292
He made you look desirable.

775
00:59:33,329 --> 00:59:35,768
Which in your case,
can't hurt sweetheart!

776
00:59:35,804 --> 00:59:36,967
He's right Katniss.

777
00:59:36,968 --> 00:59:38,219
Of course, I'm right.

778
00:59:38,238 --> 00:59:41,717
Now I can sell the star cross
lovers from District 12.

779
00:59:41,754 --> 00:59:43,187
We are not star cross lovers.

780
00:59:43,223 --> 00:59:44,802
It's a television show.

781
00:59:45,219 --> 00:59:48,047
And being in love with
that boy might just get

782
00:59:48,048 --> 00:59:50,877
you Sponsors which could
save your damn life.

783
00:59:52,545 --> 00:59:55,211
Okay..
why don't you get out of here?

784
00:59:55,742 --> 00:59:58,619
Maybe acting to live save you
both to one piece tomorrow.

785
00:59:59,046 --> 01:00:00,297
Manners.

786
01:00:31,444 --> 01:00:32,694
You too?

787
01:00:33,974 --> 01:00:35,507
Oh, hey.

788
01:00:36,278 --> 01:00:37,475
Can't sleep?

789
01:00:37,477 --> 01:00:39,603
No, of course not.

790
01:00:41,675 --> 01:00:43,509
I'm sorry I went after you.

791
01:00:46,511 --> 01:00:47,971
You know I meant that
as a compliment.

792
01:00:49,365 --> 01:00:50,616
I know.

793
01:01:01,756 --> 01:01:03,007
Listen..

794
01:01:05,194 --> 01:01:06,444
Yeah?

795
01:01:10,676 --> 01:01:12,365
I just don't wanna change me.

796
01:01:16,261 --> 01:01:17,689
How did they change you?

797
01:01:21,325 --> 01:01:22,575
I don't know.

798
01:01:22,659 --> 01:01:24,410
I'm turning to something I'm not.

799
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:29,181
I just don't wanna be another
piece in their game, you know?

800
01:01:31,756 --> 01:01:33,528
You mean you won't kill anyone?

801
01:01:35,592 --> 01:01:36,840
No.

802
01:01:37,497 --> 01:01:39,206
I'm not yet sure I would.

803
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:41,583
Just like any by off
my time came with.

804
01:01:42,938 --> 01:01:44,557
Yeah, I just keep..

805
01:01:44,558 --> 01:01:46,177
wishing I could think
of a way to show them.

806
01:01:46,688 --> 01:01:47,939
That they don't own me.

807
01:01:52,077 --> 01:01:53,878
You know, if I'm gonna die.

808
01:01:55,056 --> 01:01:56,380
I wanna still be me.

809
01:02:02,089 --> 01:02:03,371
Does that make any sense?

810
01:02:03,997 --> 01:02:05,247
Yeah.

811
01:02:07,478 --> 01:02:09,383
I just can't afford
to think like that.

812
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:15,314
I miss my sister.

813
01:02:17,772 --> 01:02:19,023
Yeah I know.

814
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:35,164
Guess, I'll see you tomorrow.

815
01:02:39,052 --> 01:02:40,300
See you tomorrow.

816
01:03:05,654 --> 01:03:08,166
They put all kind of
stuff right in front.

817
01:03:08,202 --> 01:03:10,490
Right in the mouth of the Curnocopia.

818
01:03:10,896 --> 01:03:12,885
There'll even be a bow there.

819
01:03:12,922 --> 01:03:13,786
Don't go for it.

820
01:03:13,787 --> 01:03:14,750
Why not?

821
01:03:14,751 --> 01:03:16,830
It's a Bloodbath, they're
trying to pull you in.

822
01:03:16,831 --> 01:03:18,910
It's not your game.

823
01:03:19,012 --> 01:03:21,753
You turn, run, find
a high ground.

824
01:03:21,754 --> 01:03:24,494
Look for water.
Water's your new best friend.

825
01:03:25,693 --> 01:03:30,090
Don't step off that pedestal earlier
or they'll blow you sky high.

826
01:03:30,126 --> 01:03:31,377
I won't.

827
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:44,177
Katniss.

828
01:03:45,241 --> 01:03:46,867
You can do this.

829
01:03:54,494 --> 01:03:55,745
Thanks.

830
01:04:00,131 --> 01:04:01,444
Give me your arm.

831
01:04:06,279 --> 01:04:07,529
Give me your arm.

832
01:04:14,138 --> 01:04:15,255
Give me your arm.

833
01:04:15,256 --> 01:04:16,507
What is that?

834
01:04:18,722 --> 01:04:19,973
Your tracker.

835
01:04:27,871 --> 01:04:29,289
Less than a minute people!

836
01:04:29,954 --> 01:04:30,932
Final checks.

837
01:04:30,934 --> 01:04:33,310
So fifteen up, they are flying.

838
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:11,948
Here.

839
01:05:32,353 --> 01:05:33,601
Thank you.

840
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:44,221
30 seconds.

841
01:05:50,973 --> 01:05:52,984
I'm not allowed to bet.

842
01:05:53,453 --> 01:05:55,069
But if i could I'd bet on you!

843
01:06:06,874 --> 01:06:09,219
20 seconds.

844
01:06:20,962 --> 01:06:22,963
10 seconds.

845
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:50,922
Okay, they're in the tubes.

846
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:32,111
50..

847
01:07:32,112 --> 01:07:33,326
..49..

848
01:07:33,327 --> 01:07:34,467
..48..

849
01:07:34,468 --> 01:07:36,625
..47.. 46..

850
01:07:36,709 --> 01:07:38,752
..45.. 44..

851
01:07:38,788 --> 01:07:40,831
..43.. 42..

852
01:07:40,868 --> 01:07:42,915
..41.. 40..

853
01:07:42,951 --> 01:07:44,998
..39.. 38..

854
01:07:45,035 --> 01:07:47,081
..37.. 36..

855
01:07:47,117 --> 01:07:49,416
..35.. 34..

856
01:07:49,452 --> 01:07:51,714
..33.. 32..

857
01:07:51,870 --> 01:07:53,918
..31.. 30..

858
01:07:53,955 --> 01:07:56,001
..29.. 28

859
01:07:56,038 --> 01:07:58,133
..27.. 26..

860
01:07:58,169 --> 01:08:00,240
..25.. 24..

861
01:08:00,277 --> 01:08:02,312
..23.. 22..

862
01:11:11,796 --> 01:11:13,253
And of course..

863
01:11:13,847 --> 01:11:16,896
There's the familiar
boom of the cannon.

864
01:11:16,933 --> 01:11:20,224
Which marks the end of
another fallen Tribute.

865
01:14:51,863 --> 01:14:56,312
Well, that makes 13 gone
in the first eight hours.

866
01:14:56,349 --> 01:15:00,761
And Claudius, I think I
seen alliance forming.

867
01:15:09,879 --> 01:15:11,859
Please don't kill me. Oh no!

868
01:15:14,892 --> 01:15:16,143
Hey, loverboy!

869
01:15:17,288 --> 01:15:18,914
You sure she went this way?

870
01:15:18,950 --> 01:15:20,201
Yeah, I'm sure.

871
01:15:20,998 --> 01:15:22,249
You better be.

872
01:15:22,635 --> 01:15:24,321
Yeah. That was a steer
comb back there.

873
01:15:31,096 --> 01:15:33,069
Are you sure we shouldn't
just kill him now?

874
01:15:33,106 --> 01:15:35,044
Nah. He's our best
chance at finding her.

875
01:15:57,542 --> 01:15:58,792
Sir.

876
01:16:00,669 --> 01:16:03,087
She is almost at the edge.

877
01:16:03,295 --> 01:16:05,221
Two kilometers away from
the nearest Tribute.

878
01:16:06,024 --> 01:16:07,483
Let's turn her around.

879
01:17:07,837 --> 01:17:10,506
Killing another on my account.. one.

880
01:17:10,542 --> 01:17:11,793
Two.

881
01:17:22,655 --> 01:17:24,948
Uh, she's heading
towards the left flank.

882
01:17:24,984 --> 01:17:26,235
Okay.

883
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:28,950
Sure.

884
01:18:21,687 --> 01:18:23,105
She's almost there.

885
01:18:36,911 --> 01:18:40,330
Lucia, get a cannon ready.

886
01:18:51,041 --> 01:18:52,844
Oh there she is. There she is.

887
01:19:35,089 --> 01:19:36,350
What you got baby?

888
01:20:05,380 --> 01:20:06,642
Kill here Cato!

889
01:20:11,549 --> 01:20:13,498
I'm coming for you!

890
01:20:18,707 --> 01:20:20,000
I'll do it myself.

891
01:20:29,139 --> 01:20:29,940
Get her!

892
01:20:29,941 --> 01:20:31,192
Come on. Come on.

893
01:20:34,046 --> 01:20:35,995
Maybe you should throw the sword.

894
01:20:36,923 --> 01:20:38,174
Let's just wait her out.

895
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:43,425
She's gonna come down at some points.
That's gonne start her there.

896
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:51,511
Okay.

897
01:20:52,522 --> 01:20:53,794
Somebody make a fire.

898
01:23:45,708 --> 01:23:46,959
Thank you.

899
01:24:29,473 --> 01:24:30,807
Pssst.

900
01:24:32,225 --> 01:24:33,475
Pssst.

901
01:24:57,161 --> 01:25:00,265
Claudius. I think those are
trackerjackers. Am I wrong?

902
01:25:00,755 --> 01:25:02,006
Oooh.

903
01:25:03,350 --> 01:25:05,195
Those things are very lethal.

904
01:25:05,445 --> 01:25:06,434
Very.

905
01:25:06,435 --> 01:25:08,643
For those of you who don't know.

906
01:25:08,644 --> 01:25:10,853
Trackerjackers are genetically
engineered wasps.

907
01:25:10,889 --> 01:25:13,172
Whose venom causes serious pain.

908
01:25:13,208 --> 01:25:18,574
Powerful hallucinations and
in extreme cases, death.

909
01:28:17,137 --> 01:28:18,388
Run!

910
01:28:19,044 --> 01:28:20,295
Run!

911
01:28:21,838 --> 01:28:23,014
Run!

912
01:28:23,015 --> 01:28:24,723
Damn it. Go!

913
01:28:26,005 --> 01:28:28,444
Katniss, no! What're you doing?

914
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:29,757
Go!

915
01:28:40,603 --> 01:28:42,156
Hallow isn't lethal.

916
01:28:42,427 --> 01:28:45,273
But the venom of a
trackerjacker sting..

917
01:28:45,888 --> 01:28:49,419
..is enough to doze
off hallucinations.

918
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:52,806
Please do something.

919
01:29:53,390 --> 01:29:55,120
Katniss, go!

920
01:29:56,402 --> 01:30:00,643
Get out of here!
What're you doing? Go!

921
01:31:00,071 --> 01:31:01,322
Rue?

922
01:31:04,770 --> 01:31:06,927
It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you.

923
01:31:24,851 --> 01:31:26,100
You want mine too?

924
01:31:27,517 --> 01:31:28,768
No, that's okay.

925
01:31:30,175 --> 01:31:31,426
Here.

926
01:31:32,020 --> 01:31:33,271
Thanks.

927
01:31:38,230 --> 01:31:39,658
How long was I asleep?

928
01:31:40,450 --> 01:31:42,074
A couple of days.

929
01:31:42,606 --> 01:31:44,159
I change your leaves twice.

930
01:31:46,264 --> 01:31:47,515
Thank you.

931
01:31:49,068 --> 01:31:50,973
So what happened? When I was out?

932
01:31:52,297 --> 01:31:54,746
The girl from 1 and the boy from 10.

933
01:31:56,758 --> 01:31:58,007
And the uh..

934
01:31:58,893 --> 01:32:00,467
And the boy from my district?

935
01:32:02,155 --> 01:32:03,406
No, he's okay.

936
01:32:03,750 --> 01:32:05,303
I think he's down by the river.

937
01:32:08,813 --> 01:32:10,095
Is all about true?

938
01:32:10,742 --> 01:32:11,992
What?

939
01:32:12,472 --> 01:32:13,721
You and him.

940
01:32:15,336 --> 01:32:16,952
So where are Cato and the others?

941
01:32:17,442 --> 01:32:19,547
They got all their
supplies down by the lake.

942
01:32:20,173 --> 01:32:22,213
It's prod up in this
great big pyramid.

943
01:32:23,079 --> 01:32:24,475
That sounds tempting.

944
01:32:40,606 --> 01:32:43,092
Now this green stuff is
gonna smoke like crazy, so

945
01:32:43,093 --> 01:32:45,576
as soon as you light it.
Move on to the next fire.

946
01:32:45,612 --> 01:32:47,051
Light this one last.

947
01:32:47,087 --> 01:32:48,505
And I'll meet you back over here.

948
01:32:48,541 --> 01:32:49,792
Right.

949
01:32:53,808 --> 01:32:55,893
I'll destroy their stuff
while they're chasing us.

950
01:32:56,028 --> 01:32:58,446
We need a signal, in case
one of us gets held up.

951
01:32:58,483 --> 01:32:59,733
Okay. Like what?

952
01:33:01,884 --> 01:33:03,135
Here. Watch this.

953
01:33:09,251 --> 01:33:10,627
Mocking jays.

954
01:33:11,450 --> 01:33:12,252
That's great.

955
01:33:12,253 --> 01:33:14,316
Back home, we used them
to signal all the time..

956
01:33:19,922 --> 01:33:21,173
You try.

957
01:33:30,562 --> 01:33:35,459
Okay so, if we hear that means we're
okay and we'll be back real soon.

958
01:33:36,147 --> 01:33:37,397
We're gonna be okay.

959
01:33:43,243 --> 01:33:44,493
Hey.

960
01:33:44,796 --> 01:33:46,265
I'll see you for supper.

961
01:33:47,735 --> 01:33:50,151
Okay.

962
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:19,463
Guys, guys look!

963
01:34:19,599 --> 01:34:21,475
Come here. Come on, come on look!

964
01:34:25,915 --> 01:34:26,956
Let's go.

965
01:34:26,957 --> 01:34:28,800
You stay guard over till we get back.

966
01:34:58,687 --> 01:35:01,666
I wanna see if she's gonna
figure out this booby trap.

967
01:35:01,802 --> 01:35:04,199
Yes. It seems they
reburied their mines

968
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:06,596
around that big pile of goodies.

969
01:35:18,839 --> 01:35:21,841
She certainly figure
it out, haven't she?

970
01:38:32,219 --> 01:38:33,481
Katniss!

971
01:38:35,326 --> 01:38:36,743
Katniss!

972
01:38:38,807 --> 01:38:40,431
Katniss help!

973
01:38:41,848 --> 01:38:43,099
Katniss!

974
01:38:47,662 --> 01:38:50,143
Help me! Help!

975
01:38:51,456 --> 01:38:52,707
Katniss!

976
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:54,562
Katniss!

977
01:38:55,603 --> 01:38:56,853
It's okay.

978
01:39:05,836 --> 01:39:07,087
You're okay.

979
01:39:07,170 --> 01:39:08,139
You're alright.

980
01:39:08,140 --> 01:39:09,807
You're fine.. see?

981
01:39:38,317 --> 01:39:39,509
It's okay.

982
01:39:39,510 --> 01:39:40,761
You're okay.

983
01:39:40,943 --> 01:39:42,194
You're okay.

984
01:39:42,423 --> 01:39:43,672
You're okay.

985
01:39:50,695 --> 01:39:52,592
Did you blow up the food?

986
01:39:55,698 --> 01:39:56,949
Every bit of it.

987
01:40:00,491 --> 01:40:01,741
Good.

988
01:40:03,909 --> 01:40:05,838
You have to win.

989
01:40:20,395 --> 01:40:21,645
Okay.

990
01:40:29,085 --> 01:40:32,877
Deep in the meadow.

991
01:40:33,461 --> 01:40:37,099
Under the willow.

992
01:40:37,826 --> 01:40:41,146
A bed of grass.

993
01:40:41,183 --> 01:40:45,310
A soft, green pillow.

994
01:40:46,173 --> 01:40:49,238
Lay down your head.

995
01:40:49,748 --> 01:40:53,323
And close your eyes.

996
01:44:48,062 --> 01:44:49,641
Don't kill her.

997
01:44:49,678 --> 01:44:51,192
You just create a murder.

998
01:44:51,229 --> 01:44:52,485
It seems I've already got one.

999
01:44:52,521 --> 01:44:54,564
I heard this rumors
out on District 11.

1000
01:44:54,601 --> 01:44:56,003
This could get away from here.

1001
01:44:56,044 --> 01:44:57,399
What do you want?

1002
01:44:57,908 --> 01:45:00,238
There are a lot of
anger out there.

1003
01:45:00,239 --> 01:45:02,567
I know you know how to handle
a mod, you've done it before.

1004
01:45:02,682 --> 01:45:07,943
If you can't scare them.
Give them something to root for.

1005
01:45:08,850 --> 01:45:10,101
Such as?

1006
01:45:12,467 --> 01:45:13,716
Young love.

1007
01:45:15,644 --> 01:45:17,494
So you were like an underdog.

1008
01:45:17,531 --> 01:45:19,344
Everyone likes an underdog.

1009
01:45:19,381 --> 01:45:20,631
I don't.

1010
01:45:22,115 --> 01:45:23,522
How many are dead?

1011
01:45:23,876 --> 01:45:25,450
10? 11? 12?

1012
01:45:25,888 --> 01:45:26,762
Uh..

1013
01:45:26,763 --> 01:45:28,223
Not personally, no!

1014
01:45:28,848 --> 01:45:30,097
I have.

1015
01:45:31,368 --> 01:45:32,921
Lots of underdogs.

1016
01:45:33,453 --> 01:45:34,902
Not too cold too.

1017
01:45:35,413 --> 01:45:37,237
Row crops. Minerals.

1018
01:45:38,027 --> 01:45:39,382
Things we need.

1019
01:45:40,497 --> 01:45:42,665
There are lots of underdogs.

1020
01:45:43,801 --> 01:45:46,280
And I think if you could see them.

1021
01:45:47,145 --> 01:45:49,542
You would not root for them either.

1022
01:45:52,148 --> 01:45:53,563
Unlike you..

1023
01:45:56,763 --> 01:45:58,045
Be careful.

1024
01:46:09,121 --> 01:46:11,430
Attention Tributes. Attention!

1025
01:46:11,466 --> 01:46:16,297
The regulations required a single
victor has been.. suspended!

1026
01:46:16,334 --> 01:46:20,355
From now on, two victors maybe
crowned if both originate

1027
01:46:20,356 --> 01:46:24,378
from the same district.
This will be the only announcement.

1028
01:47:28,264 --> 01:47:29,838
Oh my God! Peeta!

1029
01:47:30,213 --> 01:47:31,464
Peeta!

1030
01:47:34,257 --> 01:47:35,508
Hi.

1031
01:47:38,653 --> 01:47:39,904
It's okay.

1032
01:47:55,399 --> 01:47:56,650
What was it?

1033
01:47:57,181 --> 01:47:58,432
The sword.

1034
01:47:59,910 --> 01:48:01,161
It's badly hurt.

1035
01:48:02,818 --> 01:48:04,069
It's gonna be fine.

1036
01:48:17,188 --> 01:48:18,438
Katniss..

1037
01:48:21,857 --> 01:48:22,685
Katniss..

1038
01:48:22,686 --> 01:48:23,935
No!

1039
01:48:24,961 --> 01:48:26,243
I'm not gonna leave you!

1040
01:48:27,067 --> 01:48:28,578
I'm not gonna do that.

1041
01:48:36,362 --> 01:48:37,613
Why not?

1042
01:48:57,713 --> 01:49:00,266
Nobody's gonna find you in here.

1043
01:49:00,506 --> 01:49:01,903
They already found me.

1044
01:49:06,080 --> 01:49:08,300
We just get you some medicine.

1045
01:49:08,519 --> 01:49:10,466
He can't.
They don't give so much parachutes.

1046
01:49:11,530 --> 01:49:12,780
We'll figure something out.

1047
01:49:13,802 --> 01:49:15,053
Like what?

1048
01:49:15,970 --> 01:49:17,221
Something.

1049
01:50:18,481 --> 01:50:19,763
Is that medicine?

1050
01:50:19,816 --> 01:50:20,742
No!

1051
01:50:20,743 --> 01:50:21,992
Soup.

1052
01:50:33,591 --> 01:50:35,123
Nice taste.

1053
01:50:37,185 --> 01:50:39,228
Do you fed - once?

1054
01:50:42,136 --> 01:50:43,887
I think about that all the time.

1055
01:50:46,011 --> 01:50:47,574
How I tossed you that bread.

1056
01:50:47,877 --> 01:50:48,637
Peeta.

1057
01:50:48,638 --> 01:50:50,524
I should've gone to you.

1058
01:50:50,525 --> 01:50:52,411
I should've just gone
out to the rain.

1059
01:50:55,160 --> 01:50:56,734
You feel hot.

1060
01:50:59,069 --> 01:51:01,110
I remember the first time I saw you.

1061
01:51:02,527 --> 01:51:05,060
Your hair was in two
braids instead of one.

1062
01:51:05,988 --> 01:51:07,270
I remember when you..

1063
01:51:07,624 --> 01:51:10,405
You sang in music as
simply the teacher said.

1064
01:51:10,426 --> 01:51:13,553
Who knows the pie song in
your head shut straight up!

1065
01:51:15,221 --> 01:51:16,751
After that..

1066
01:51:17,241 --> 01:51:19,211
I watched you going home everyday.

1067
01:51:21,879 --> 01:51:23,130
Everyday.

1068
01:51:31,174 --> 01:51:32,454
Well, say something.

1069
01:51:35,873 --> 01:51:37,499
I'm not gonna say something.

1070
01:51:40,290 --> 01:51:41,541
You can come here.

1071
01:51:43,469 --> 01:51:44,720
Please.

1072
01:51:56,640 --> 01:51:58,777
If I don't even make it.

1073
01:52:06,988 --> 01:52:09,448
Attention Tributes. Attention!

1074
01:52:09,484 --> 01:52:11,277
Commencing Insuberance.

1075
01:52:11,314 --> 01:52:14,303
There will be a feast
tomorrow at the Curnocopia.

1076
01:52:14,616 --> 01:52:17,305
This will be no ordinary occasion.

1077
01:52:17,341 --> 01:52:19,481
Each of you needs something.

1078
01:52:19,518 --> 01:52:21,014
Desperately.

1079
01:52:21,389 --> 01:52:23,515
And we planned to be..

1080
01:52:24,005 --> 01:52:25,318
..generous hosts.

1081
01:52:25,558 --> 01:52:26,809
You rather sit.

1082
01:52:28,287 --> 01:52:30,356
That we needed and you can't walk.

1083
01:52:30,392 --> 01:52:31,778
Promise me, you'll not gonna
risk your life for me.

1084
01:52:31,780 --> 01:52:33,165
I'm not gonna let you.

1085
01:52:33,373 --> 01:52:34,624
You would do it for me.

1086
01:52:35,456 --> 01:52:36,707
Wouldn't you?

1087
01:52:38,270 --> 01:52:39,583
Why are you doing this?

1088
01:53:00,746 --> 01:53:01,840
Peeta!

1089
01:53:01,841 --> 01:53:03,092
Please.

1090
01:53:03,832 --> 01:53:05,082
Stay.

1091
01:53:10,115 --> 01:53:11,365
Okay.

1092
01:53:12,418 --> 01:53:13,888
I'll stay.

1093
01:55:08,688 --> 01:55:09,939
No!

1094
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:17,035
Where's lover boy?

1095
01:55:20,183 --> 01:55:22,166
Oh I see.

1096
01:55:22,203 --> 01:55:23,964
You're gonna help him right?

1097
01:55:24,621 --> 01:55:25,872
That's sweet.

1098
01:55:26,049 --> 01:55:29,351
Now, it's too bad you couldn't
help your little friend.

1099
01:55:29,747 --> 01:55:32,634
That little girl..
what was her name again?

1100
01:55:33,124 --> 01:55:34,375
Rue?

1101
01:55:36,426 --> 01:55:38,646
Yeah. Well we killed her.

1102
01:55:39,428 --> 01:55:40,887
And now..

1103
01:55:41,356 --> 01:55:43,066
We're gonna kill you..

1104
01:55:48,609 --> 01:55:49,859
You kill her?

1105
01:55:49,896 --> 01:55:51,110
No!

1106
01:55:51,319 --> 01:55:53,344
Cato!

1107
01:55:53,380 --> 01:55:54,631
Shout her name!

1108
01:56:04,771 --> 01:56:06,563
Just this time twelve.

1109
01:56:07,408 --> 01:56:08,656
For Rue!

1110
01:56:24,339 --> 01:56:25,725
Peeta!

1111
01:56:25,762 --> 01:56:27,075
I got it.

1112
01:56:27,112 --> 01:56:28,540
I got the medicine.

1113
01:56:28,576 --> 01:56:29,931
What happened to you?

1114
01:56:29,968 --> 01:56:31,675
No, I'm not. What happened?

1115
01:56:31,790 --> 01:56:33,858
The girl from two, she threw a knife.
I'm okay.

1116
01:56:33,895 --> 01:56:35,813
You shouldn't have gone.
You said you aren't gonna go.

1117
01:56:35,849 --> 01:56:37,100
You got worse.

1118
01:56:44,035 --> 01:56:45,973
You get some of that too.

1119
01:56:46,010 --> 01:56:47,260
I'm okay.

1120
01:56:50,140 --> 01:56:51,391
That feels better.

1121
01:56:53,361 --> 01:56:54,496
Okay.

1122
01:56:54,497 --> 01:56:55,746
Are you?

1123
01:56:56,007 --> 01:56:56,756
I'm okay.

1124
01:56:56,757 --> 01:56:58,081
No, come on. You need it too.

1125
01:56:58,842 --> 01:57:00,092
Come on.

1126
01:58:03,209 --> 01:58:04,459
Oh.

1127
01:58:04,782 --> 01:58:06,033
You're so much better.

1128
01:58:08,710 --> 01:58:10,242
Oh my God, Peeta.

1129
01:58:11,243 --> 01:58:13,088
I couldn't feel anything.

1130
01:58:14,347 --> 01:58:15,597
We could go home.

1131
01:58:16,838 --> 01:58:18,589
We could. With all the team left.

1132
01:58:20,079 --> 01:58:21,330
We could go home.

1133
01:58:26,091 --> 01:58:27,884
We know - took off.

1134
01:58:28,061 --> 01:58:29,972
Cate's gonna be by
the Curnocopia.

1135
01:58:29,973 --> 01:58:31,885
He's not gonna go to
places he doesn't know.

1136
01:58:32,083 --> 01:58:33,969
Fox face, she could be anywhere.

1137
01:58:37,117 --> 01:58:40,179
We should probably hunt around here.
We don't have any food left.

1138
01:58:40,357 --> 01:58:42,264
Okay, uh, I'll take the bow.

1139
01:58:44,349 --> 01:58:45,597
I'm just kidding.

1140
01:59:04,897 --> 01:59:06,147
Peeta?

1141
01:59:10,315 --> 01:59:11,565
Peeta?

1142
01:59:14,744 --> 01:59:15,995
Peeta?

1143
01:59:16,965 --> 01:59:18,181
Peeta?

1144
01:59:18,182 --> 01:59:19,255
Are you okay?

1145
01:59:19,256 --> 01:59:20,736
I hear the cannon.

1146
01:59:21,184 --> 01:59:22,919
That's nightlock Peeta!

1147
01:59:22,956 --> 01:59:24,561
You will be dead in a minute.

1148
01:59:24,597 --> 01:59:25,821
I.. I didn't know.

1149
01:59:25,822 --> 01:59:27,073
You scare me to death.

1150
01:59:27,290 --> 01:59:28,541
Damn you.

1151
01:59:28,577 --> 01:59:29,828
I'm sorry.

1152
01:59:31,855 --> 01:59:33,104
I'm sorry.

1153
01:59:41,065 --> 01:59:43,066
I don't even knew, she
was following me.

1154
01:59:43,577 --> 01:59:44,828
She's clever.

1155
01:59:45,276 --> 01:59:46,527
Too clever.

1156
01:59:47,965 --> 01:59:49,140
What're you doing?

1157
01:59:49,141 --> 01:59:50,913
Maybe Cato likes berries too?

1158
01:59:56,841 --> 01:59:58,092
What time is it?

1159
01:59:58,488 --> 01:59:59,937
A little afternoon.

1160
01:59:59,974 --> 02:00:01,349
Why is it so dark?

1161
02:00:01,386 --> 02:00:03,470
Must be in a hurry to end it.

1162
02:00:06,335 --> 02:00:07,220
Ready Lusia?

1163
02:00:07,221 --> 02:00:08,555
Oh right here sir!

1164
02:00:10,316 --> 02:00:11,567
That's great.

1165
02:00:12,378 --> 02:00:13,681
Can you put that in the middle?

1166
02:00:13,717 --> 02:00:14,968
Sure.

1167
02:00:23,153 --> 02:00:24,404
That's it.

1168
02:00:25,645 --> 02:00:27,239
That's it. Excellent.

1169
02:00:37,492 --> 02:00:39,378
Did you hear that?

1170
02:01:12,442 --> 02:01:13,693
What was that?

1171
02:01:14,569 --> 02:01:15,859
It's the finale.

1172
02:01:31,792 --> 02:01:33,043
Let's go.

1173
02:03:26,281 --> 02:03:27,532
Here.

1174
02:04:40,110 --> 02:04:41,359
Go on.

1175
02:04:42,214 --> 02:04:43,465
Shoot.

1176
02:04:45,257 --> 02:04:46,988
And we both go down and you'd win.

1177
02:04:50,894 --> 02:04:52,145
Go on.

1178
02:04:53,844 --> 02:04:55,574
Dead anyway.

1179
02:05:00,210 --> 02:05:01,524
I always want a drink.

1180
02:05:04,409 --> 02:05:05,910
Until not so now.

1181
02:05:09,818 --> 02:05:11,507
How's that? Is that what you want?

1182
02:05:11,543 --> 02:05:12,792
Huh!

1183
02:05:14,298 --> 02:05:15,549
No!

1184
02:05:17,613 --> 02:05:19,322
I can still do this.

1185
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:22,718
I can still do it.

1186
02:05:23,646 --> 02:05:25,001
One more kill.

1187
02:05:27,575 --> 02:05:29,210
It's the only thing I know how to do.

1188
02:05:30,439 --> 02:05:32,962
Bring pride to the district.

1189
02:05:36,514 --> 02:05:37,765
Not that it matters.

1190
02:06:05,453 --> 02:06:06,704
Please..!

1191
02:06:54,085 --> 02:06:56,501
Attention. Attention Tributes.

1192
02:06:56,689 --> 02:06:59,993
There has been a slight rule change.

1193
02:07:00,212 --> 02:07:04,358
The previous provision
allowing for two victors

1194
02:07:04,359 --> 02:07:08,506
from the same district
has been revoked.

1195
02:07:08,543 --> 02:07:13,101
Only one victor maybe crowned.
Goodluck.

1196
02:07:14,018 --> 02:07:17,145
And may the odds be
ever in your favor.

1197
02:07:31,837 --> 02:07:33,088
Go ahead.

1198
02:07:36,964 --> 02:07:38,308
One of us should go home!

1199
02:07:39,819 --> 02:07:41,923
One of us has to die.
They had to have their victor.

1200
02:07:44,101 --> 02:07:45,352
No.

1201
02:07:46,207 --> 02:07:47,458
They don't.

1202
02:07:49,427 --> 02:07:50,676
Why should they?

1203
02:07:51,864 --> 02:07:52,697
No!

1204
02:07:52,698 --> 02:07:53,741
Trust me.

1205
02:07:54,376 --> 02:07:55,627
Trust me.

1206
02:08:14,654 --> 02:08:15,904
Together?

1207
02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:18,771
Together.

1208
02:08:20,011 --> 02:08:21,260
Okay.

1209
02:08:22,114 --> 02:08:23,365
One..

1210
02:08:25,669 --> 02:08:26,919
Two..

1211
02:08:32,984 --> 02:08:34,234
Three..

1212
02:08:35,933 --> 02:08:37,182
Stop!

1213
02:08:37,953 --> 02:08:39,204
Stop!

1214
02:08:42,571 --> 02:08:43,822
Ladies and gentlemen.

1215
02:08:44,789 --> 02:08:46,498
May I present the winners..

1216
02:08:47,030 --> 02:08:49,980
.. of the 74th Annual Hunger Games.

1217
02:09:16,634 --> 02:09:18,562
They're not happy with you.

1218
02:09:19,364 --> 02:09:20,865
Why? Because we didn't die?

1219
02:09:22,220 --> 02:09:23,471
Because you showed them all.

1220
02:09:24,470 --> 02:09:25,532
Well..

1221
02:09:25,533 --> 02:09:27,227
I'm sorry it didn't go
the way they planned.

1222
02:09:27,228 --> 02:09:28,920
You know I'm not very
happy with them either.

1223
02:09:28,957 --> 02:09:30,208
Katniss..

1224
02:09:30,348 --> 02:09:31,599
This is serious.

1225
02:09:32,181 --> 02:09:33,572
Not just for you.

1226
02:09:33,609 --> 02:09:35,276
They don't take this things lightly.

1227
02:10:28,597 --> 02:10:32,089
You say you couldn't help yourself.
You're so in love

1228
02:10:32,090 --> 02:10:35,578
with this boy that the dark
have not with the most..

1229
02:10:35,615 --> 02:10:37,303
Unthinkable..

1230
02:10:37,340 --> 02:10:41,436
You rather die.. than not
be with him you understand?

1231
02:10:41,472 --> 02:10:42,723
How did you feel?

1232
02:10:43,216 --> 02:10:46,302
When you found him by the river?

1233
02:10:50,585 --> 02:10:53,085
I felt like the happiest
person in the world.

1234
02:10:57,244 --> 02:10:59,149
I couldn't imagine life without him.

1235
02:11:05,736 --> 02:11:08,309
And what about you Peeta?

1236
02:11:08,820 --> 02:11:10,592
Damn, she just saved my life.

1237
02:11:10,628 --> 02:11:11,967
We saved each other.

1238
02:11:13,500 --> 02:11:14,748
Ladies and gentlemen.

1239
02:11:15,342 --> 02:11:19,673
The star cross lovers
of District 12, this

1240
02:11:19,674 --> 02:11:24,002
years victors of the 74th
Annual Hunger Games.

1241
02:11:40,466 --> 02:11:41,717
Congratulations.

1242
02:11:42,061 --> 02:11:43,312
Thank you.

1243
02:11:48,917 --> 02:11:50,272
What a lovely pin.

1244
02:11:50,668 --> 02:11:52,576
Thank you, it's from my district.

1245
02:11:53,950 --> 02:11:56,128
They must be very proud of you.

1246
02:12:08,842 --> 02:12:10,445
So what happens when we get back?

1247
02:12:12,613 --> 02:12:13,864
I don't know.

1248
02:12:15,052 --> 02:12:16,939
I guess I may try to forget.

1249
02:12:21,450 --> 02:12:23,264
I don't wanna forget.
