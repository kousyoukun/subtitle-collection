00:00:33,996 --> 00:00:36,570
引自叛國罪條款：
From the Treaty of the Treason:

4
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,684
為使叛亂者贖罪，每個地區每年都要
In penance for their uprising,each district shall offer up

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
公開「抽籤」選擇一對年齡
在12-18歲的少年男女作為貢品
a male and female between the ages of 12 and 18 at a public 'reaping'.

6
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,260
這些貢品會被送至都城凱匹特監管
(註：凱匹特為施惠國的都城，對旗下12個行政區
具有絕對統治權，是「飢餓遊戲」的始作俑者)
These Tributes shall be delivered to the custody of the Capitol.

7
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,893
然後送至競技場，他們將在那裏戰鬥至死
直到剩下最後一名勝利者
（註：競技場，飢餓遊戲每屆都會選擇全新的比賽
場地，由荒廢土地改建而成；比賽後成為旅遊勝地）
And then transferred to a public arena where they will Fight to the Death, until a lone victor remains.

8
00:00:58,144 --> 00:01:01,600
這個盛會自此永遠地被稱為
{\1c&H0080FF&}飢餓遊戲{\r}
Henceforth and forevermore this pageant shall be known as The Hunger Games.

9
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:02,646
我想這是我們的傳統
<i>I think it's our tradition.</i>

10
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,108
它源於我們國家歷史上極其慘痛的那段經歷
It comes out of a particularly painful
part of our history.

11
00:01:06,192 --> 00:01:07,276
是的
Yes, yes.

12
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,362
但它已經成為使我們能夠治癒痛苦的方式
But it's been the way
we've been able to heal.

13
00:01:10,446 --> 00:01:12,615
起初，這是對叛亂行為的警示
At first, it was a reminder of the rebellion.

14
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:15,534
- 叛亂地區必須因此而付出代價
- 對
- It was a price the districts had to pay.
- Yes.

15
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:17,870
但我認為現在更成熟了一些
But I think it has grown from that.

16
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:21,373
這可以讓我們團結在一起
I think it's something
that knits us all together.

17
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,461
作為連續三年的遊戲製作者
This is your third year as Gamemaker.

18
00:01:27,463 --> 00:01:30,591
您的座右銘是什麼？
What defines your personal signature?

19
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:34,720
不！不！
No! No!

21
00:01:36,806 --> 00:01:41,227
沒事，別怕，你只是在做夢，一個夢罷了
It's okay. It's okay. You were just dreaming.
You were dreaming.

22
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:44,647
我夢見被選中了
It was me.

23
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:48,859
我知道，但是事實不是這樣的
I know. I know. But it's not.

24
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:52,154
這是你的第一年，普利姆
你的名字只在那出現過一次
It's your first year, Prim.
Your name's only been in there once.

25
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:54,323
他們不會選你的
They're not gonna pick you.

26
00:01:54,824 --> 00:01:56,575
再去睡會吧
Try to go to sleep.

27
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:57,868
我睡不著
I can't.

28
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:01,372
試試吧，躺下就睡著了
Just try. Just try.

你還記得這歌？很好
You remember that song? Okay.

34
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:36,157
把它唱完，我得出去下
You finish it. I've got to go.

35
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,283
去哪？
Where?

36
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,326
我必須得走了
I've just got to go.

37
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:42,454
不過我會回來的，我愛你
<i>But I'll be back. I love you</i>

00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,840
我還是要把你燉了

你打算怎麼獵殺它？

when you kill it?

42
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:10,519
該死，蓋爾！這並不好笑！
Damn you, Gale! It's not funny!

43
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:13,647
對於重達100磅的鹿你還能怎麼辦？凱特尼普
（注:女主角叫Katniss，為印地安語的慈菇之意，是伴水而生的植物，
根部可食用。由於發音類似，蓋爾昵稱她為Catnip，意為貓薄荷）
What are you gonna do
with a 100-pound deer, Catnip?

44
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:16,275
今天是抽籤日，到處都是維和部隊
It's Reaping Day.
The place is crawling with Peacekeepers.

45
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,486
我本打算把它賣給維和部隊的
I was gonna sell it to some Peacekeepers.

46
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,779
當然
Of course you were.

47
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:22,114
就像你不賣給他們似的
Like you don't sell to Peacekeepers.

48
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,532
不，不是今天
No. Not today.

49
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,618
這可是今年我看到的第一頭鹿
現在什麼都沒了
It was the first deer I've seen in a year.
Now I have nothing.

50
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:27,828
好吧
Okay.

51
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:21,173
如果他們不看了呢？只有一年
假使大家都不看飢餓遊戲了呢？
What if they did? Just one year.
What if everyone just stopped watching?

52
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,384
- 不會的，蓋爾
- 如果他們不看了呢？如果我們不看了呢？
- They won't, Gale.
- What if they did? What if we did?

53
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:25,010
不會的
Won't happen.

54
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:27,179
你會為自己喜歡的選手加油
一旦被殺你就會哭個不停
You root for your favorites.
You cry when they get killed.

55
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,514
- 真噁心
- 蓋爾
- It's sick.
- Gale.

56
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:30,974
如果沒人看，他們就沒這個遊戲
If no one watches,
then they don't have a game.

57
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,518
再簡單不過
It's as simple as that.

58
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,186
- 什麼？
- 沒什麼
- What?
- Nothing.

59
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:38,315
- 好吧，你就笑我吧
- 我沒笑你
- Fine. Laugh at me.
- I'm not laughing at you.

60
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:46,198
我們能做到，你知道嗎？
We could do it, you know?

61
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,411
離開這，在樹林裏生活，這就是我們要做的
Take off, live in the woods.
It's what we do anyway.

62
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:51,537
他們會把我們抓回來的
They'd catch us.

63
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,247
也許不會
Well, maybe not.

64
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:57,376
割掉我們的舌頭，甚至更糟
我們跑不出五英里
Cut out our tongues, or worse.
We wouldn't make it five miles.

65
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:00,295
不，我已經跑出五英里了，我走的那條路
No, I'd get five miles. I'd go that way.

66
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:03,048
我這還有普利姆，你也有弟弟
I have Prim, and you have your brothers.

67
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:04,133
他們可以一起來
They can come, too.

68
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:05,926
讓普利姆到樹林裏生活？
Prim in the woods?

69
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,263
也許未必
Or maybe not.

70
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:12,474
我沒要過孩子
I'm never having kids.

71
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,727
我也許會要，如果不在這兒生活的話
I might, if I didn't live here.

72
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:17,980
- 但你就在這生活
- 我知道，我是說假如
- But you do live here.
- I know, but if I didn't.

73
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:22,901
差點忘了
I forgot.

74
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:24,570
給
Here.

75
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:27,239
天吶！真的嗎？
Oh, my God! Is this real?

76
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,825
當然是真的，我用一個松鼠換的
Yeah. Better be. Cost me a squirrel.

77
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,744
飢餓遊戲快樂
Happy Hunger Games.

"And may the odds be ever in your favor."

79

今天你名字被用多少次了？
How many times is your name in today?

80
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:44,173
42次
Forty-two.

81
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:48,010
我看好運並不站在我這邊
Guess the odds aren't exactly in my favor.

82
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,747
謝謝，閨女
Thank you, girl.

83
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,131
這是什麼？
What's this?

84
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:28,717
這是「自由夢幻」
That's a Mockingjay.

85
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,262
多少錢？
How much?

86
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:37,309
- 拿著吧，歸你了
- 謝謝
- You keep it. It's yours.
- Thank you.

看看你！
Look at you!

真漂亮
You look beautiful.

90
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,706
但最好把這個掖在後面，小鴨子
But you better tuck in that tail,little duck.

91
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,416
我也給你準備了點東西
I laid something out for you, too.

92
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:05,420
好的
Okay.

93
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,905
現在你也很漂亮了
Now you look beautiful, too.

94
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,699
真希望我能像你一樣
Wish I looked like you.

95
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:37,953
不，我希望像你一樣漂亮，小鴨子
No. l wish I looked like you, little duck.

96
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,545
嘿，想看看今天我給你帶什麼了嗎？
Hey. You want to see what I got you today?

97
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,551
這是自由夢幻胸針，可以保護你
It's a Mockingjay pin. To protect you.

98
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:58,015
只要你戴著它，就不會有霉運
And as long as you have it,
nothing bad will happen to you.

99
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,267
好麼？我保證
Okay? I promise.

100
00:10:58,075 --> 00:10:59,951
普利姆，沒事的
Prim, it's okay. It's okay.

101
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:01,787
現在開始登記了，好嗎？
Okay. It's time to sign in now. Okay?

102
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,997
他們會戳一下你的手指取一點點血
They're gonna prick your finger
just to take a little bit of blood.

103
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,207
- 你之前不是說…
- 我知道
- You didn't say...
- I know.

104
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,875
並不會很痛，一點點而已
It doesn't hurt much. Just a little.

105
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:10,879
好麼？登記完去和那些小朋友坐一起
然後我會去找你，明白麼？
Okay? Go sit down there with the little kids.
I'll find you after. Okay?

希望好運永遠站在你這邊
<i>And may the odds be ever in your favor.</i>

116
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:37,799
現在，開始之前，我們有一部特別的影片
<i>Now, before we begin,
we have a very special film.</i>

117
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:41,553
為了大家從凱匹特一路帶回來的
<i>Brought to you all the way from The Capitol.</i>

118
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,392
戰爭，可怕的戰爭
War. Terrible war.

119
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:49,978
戰爭
<i>War.</i>

120
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:55,734
可怕的戰爭，寡婦、孤兒和失去母親的孩子
<i>Terrible war.
Widows, orphans, a motherless child.</i>

121
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:59,446
暴動使我們的國家陷入內亂
<i>This was the uprising that rocked our land.</i>

122
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,492
13區背叛了一直哺育、熱愛
<i>Thirteen districts rebelled against
the country that fed them,</i>

123
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,410
和保護他們的祖國
<i>loved them, protected them.</i>

124
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:09,372
同胞之前互相殘殺直至所剩無幾
<i>Brother turned on brother
until nothing remained.</i>

125
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:14,336
之後便迎來和平，這是一次艱難的戰鬥，慘痛的勝利
<i>And then came the peace,
hard fought, sorely won.</i>

126
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:18,715
人們浩劫餘生，一個新紀元誕生了
<i>A people rose up from the ashes,
and a new era was born.</i>

127
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:23,678
但自由是需要付出代價的，叛徒被擊敗了
<i>But freedom has a cost.
And the traitors were defeated.</i>

128
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:28,350
做為國民我們發誓永遠不會讓悲劇重演
<i>We swore as a nation
we would never know this treason again.</i>

129
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:33,647
所以法律規定施惠國的不同區域每年
<i>And so it was decreed that each year
the various districts of Panem</i>

130
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,359
要奉上一對少年男女作為貢品
<i>would offer up, in tribute,
one young man and woman</i>

131
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:42,614
為了榮譽、勇氣和奉獻戰鬥至死
<i>to fight to the death in a pageant of honor,
courage, and sacrifice.</i>

132
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:46,993
唯一的倖存者會變得非常富有
<i>The lone victor, bathed in riches,
would serve as a reminder</i>

133
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:50,121
以此彰顯我們的慷慨和寬恕
<i>of our generosity and our forgiveness.</i>

134
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:52,874
這就是我們銘記過往
<i>This is how we remember our past.</i>

135
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:57,003
保護未來的方式
<i>This is how we safeguard our future.</i>

136
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:58,672
我很喜歡這段話！
<i>I just love that!</i>

137
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:05,136
現在，是時候讓我們選擇
<i>Now, the time has come for us to select</i>

138
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:09,099
一對勇敢的年輕男女
<i>one courageous young man and woman</i>

139
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:17,065
作為第74屆年度飢餓遊戲12區榮譽代表了
<i>for the honor of representing District 12
in the 74th Annual Hunger Games.</i>

140
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,903
像往常一樣，女士優先
<i>As usual, ladies first.</i>

141
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,598
普利姆羅斯·埃弗丁
<i>Primrose Everdeen.</i>

142
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,607
親愛的，你在哪？
<i>Where are you, dear?</i>

143
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,525
上來吧
<i>Come on up.</i>

144
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:03,320
來吧
<i>Well, come on up.</i>

145
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,469
普利姆！普利姆！
Prim! Prim!

146
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,471
不，不！
No. No!

147
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:31,723
我當志願者！我要當志願者！
I volunteer! I volunteer!

148
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:34,476
我自願作為貢品！
I volunteer as Tribute!

149
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:40,732
我們擁有一位志願者，市長先生
<i>I believe we have</i> a <i>volunteer, Mr. Mayor.</i>

150
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,776
普利姆，你得馬上離開這，快走
Prim, you need to get out of here.
You need to get out of here.

151
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,194
- 不！不！
- 去找媽媽！
- No!No!
- Go find Mom!

152
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,904
- 普利姆，現在去找媽媽，很抱歉
- 不！
- Prim, go find Mom right now. I'm so sorry.
- No!

153
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:49,449
- 去找媽媽，普利姆，快走！去找媽媽！
- 不！不！不！
- Go find Mom. Prim, leave! Go find Mom.
- No!No!No!

154
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:53,119
不！不！不！
- No!No!No!
- Come on.

155
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:56,414
12區出現了戲劇性的轉變
<i>A dramatic turn of events here in District 12.</i>

156
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,292
好了
<i>Yes, well.</i>

157
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:03,254
12區史上第一位志願者
帶她上來
<i>District 12's very first volunteer.
Bring her up.</i>

158
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:08,843
來，親愛的
Come on, dear.

159
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,105
你叫什麼名字？
<i>What's your name?</i>

160
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:21,856
凱特尼斯·埃弗丁
<i>Katniss Everdeen.</i>

161
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,860
我打賭她一定是你妹妹，對嗎？
<i>Well, I bet my hat that was your sister,
wasn't it?</i>

162
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,363
是的
<i>Yes.</i>

163
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:34,828
讓我們對第一位志願者，凱特尼斯·埃弗丁，報以熱烈掌聲!
<i>Let's have a big hand for
our very first volunteer, Katniss Everdeen.</i>

164
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,885
現在輪到男孩了
<i>And now for the boys.</i>

165
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,230
皮塔·麥拉克
<i>Peeta Mellark.</i>

166
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:27,505
人齊了
<i>Here we are.</i>

167
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:31,426
這就是我們12區的貢品
<i>Our Tributes from District 12.</i>

168
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,387
好了，你們倆握個手吧
<i>Well, go on, you two, shake hands.</i>

169
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,569
飢餓遊戲快樂
<i>Happy Hunger Games.</i>

170
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:53,865
希望好運永遠站在你這邊
<i>And may the odds be ever in your favor.</i>

171
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:08,880
給你三分鐘
You have three minutes.

172
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:13,593
沒事的
It's okay.

173
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:18,264
普利姆，普利姆，沒事
普利姆，我沒多少時間了
Prim. Prim. It's okay.
Prim, I don't have much time.

174
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:22,894
普利姆，聽著，你會沒事的
不要從他們那拿走額外的食物
Prim. Listen. You're gonna be okay.
Don't take any extra food from them.

175
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,188
這不值得多次記錄你的名字，好嗎？
It isn't worth putting your name in
more times. Okay?

176
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:29,234
聽著，普利姆，蓋爾會帶你玩的
你可以把羊奶酪賣掉
Listen, Prim. Gale will bring you game.
You can sell cheese from your goat.

177
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,903
要努力贏得比賽，也許你可以的
Just try to win. Maybe you can.

178
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:33,988
當然
Of course.

179
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:36,991
或許我能贏的，我很聰明，知道麼？
And maybe I can. I am smart, you know?

180
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:39,828
- 你會打獵
- 對呀
- And you can hunt.
- Exactly.

181
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,836
保護你
To protect you.

182
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,676
謝謝
Thank you.

183
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:58,266
（註：所有12-18歲的少男少女均可申請
食物兌換卷，領取1人1年份的糧食與油）

184
00:18:59,421 --> 00:19:01,963
（這份優惠同樣需要付出相應的代價
一張兌換券等於增加一次抽籤名條）

185
00:19:03,124 --> 00:19:07,022
（對於窮人來說無異於提高自己成為貢品的幾率
因此凱特尼斯在離開前囑咐妹妹不要領取食物兌換券）

186
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,899
你不能再被選為貢品了
You can't tune out again.

187
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:13,862
- 不會的
- 不，你不能。別像爸爸死的時候一樣
- I won't.
- No, you can't. Not like when Dad died.

188
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,613
我不能再到那了，你就是她的一切
I won't be there anymore. You're all she has.

189
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:18,741
無論你是怎麼想的，你必須為了她去那，明白嗎？
No matter what you feel, you have to
be there for her. Do you understand?

190
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,786
別哭
Don't cry.

191
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,458
別哭，別哭，別
Don't cry. Don't. Don't.

192
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,671
- 時間到了
- 普利姆，沒事的
- It's time.
- Prim, it's okay.

193
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:35,633
- 普利姆，別擔心，沒事，普利姆
- 不！不！不！
- Prim, it's okay. It's okay, Prim.
- No!No!No!

194
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:37,677
我保證，普利姆
I promise, Prim.

195
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:56,613
- 我很好
- 我知道
- I'm fine.
- Yeah, I know.

196
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:57,906
真沒事
I am.

197
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:02,827
聽我說，你比他們任何一個人都優秀
Listen to me. You're stronger than they are.
You are.

198
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,162
- 弄一個弓
- 他們可能沒有…
- Get to a bow.
- They may not have...

199
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:06,497
如果你足夠優秀他們會想辦法的
They will if you show them
how good you are.

200
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:08,708
人們只是想要一場好看的比賽
僅此而已
They just want a good show.
That's all they want.

201
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,627
如果他們沒有弓，你就做一個，好麼？
If they don't have a bow,
then you make one, okay?

202
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,211
你知道如何狩獵
You know how to hunt.

203
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:13,546
動物
Animals.

204
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:16,341
這沒什麼不同，凱特尼斯
It's no different, Katniss.

205
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:21,512
我們有24個人，蓋爾，只有一個人能活著
There's 24 of us, Gale. Only one comes out.

206
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:23,765
這個人一定是你
Yeah. And it's gonna be you.

207
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:25,391
好了
Okay.

208
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,644
照顧好她們，蓋爾
無論怎樣，別讓他們挨餓
Take care of them, Gale.
Whatever you do, don't let them starve.

209
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,771
- 走吧
- 我會盡快再見到你的，好嗎？
- Let's go.
- I'll see you soon, okay?

210
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:34,692
你們倆會喜歡的
You two are in for a treat.

211
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:38,446
水晶吊燈，白金門把手，速度快極了
Crystal chandeliers, platinum doorknobs,
and it flies.

212
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,698
我們會在凱匹特停留不到兩天
We'll be at The Capitol
in less than two days.

213
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:43,284
現在，在你做其他事之前…
Now, before you do anything else...

214
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,260
200英里每小時，幾乎沒什麼感覺
<i>200 miles per hour,
and you can barely feel a thing.</i>

215
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:45,096
即使你們在這，哪怕只有一小會
I think it's one of the wonderful things about
this opportunity,

216
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:48,725
我想這次機遇也是一件很美妙的事情
that even though you're here
and even though it's just for a little while,

217
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,352
你們可以享受這裏的一切
you get to enjoy all of this.

218
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:59,444
我去找黑密斯，他可能在酒吧車廂那
I'm going to find Haymitch.
He's probably in the bar car.

219
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:13,374
你之前見過他嗎？
Have you ever met him?

220
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:17,420
黑密斯？
Haymitch?

221
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:25,887
你知道的，凱特尼斯，他是我們的導師，贏過一次比賽
You know, Katniss, he is our mentor.
He did win this thing once.

222
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,146
好吧，如果你不想和我交談，我理解
Look, you know,
if you don't want to talk, I understand,

223
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:38,441
但我不認為想得到一點幫助有什麼錯的
but I just don't think there's anything wrong
with getting a little bit of help.

224
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,926
恭喜
Congratulations.

225
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,488
冰塊呢？
Where's the ice?

226
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:28,449
不知道
I don't know.

227
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:35,957
可以坐下嗎？
May I?

228
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:44,549
好的，我們什麼時候開始？
Okay, so... So when do we start?

229
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,343
太心切了
So eager.

230
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:50,638
多數人都沒這麼猴急
Most of you aren't in such a hurry.

231
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:53,224
我想知道計劃是什麼，你是我倆的導師啊
Yeah. I wanna know what the plan is.
You're our mentor.

232
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:54,642
- 你應該…
- 導師？
- You're supposed to go...
- Mentor?

233
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,019
是啊，我們的導師
Yeah, our mentor.

234
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,772
你應該告訴我們如何獲得贊助並給些建議
You're supposed to tell us
how to get sponsors and give us advice.

235
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:01,732
好吧
Okay.

236
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:07,155
做好有可能將死的準備
Embrace the probability
of your imminent death.

237
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:14,370
要知道，在你們心中，我救不了你們
And know, in your heart,
that there's nothing I can do to save you.

238
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,373
那你為什麼還在這？
So why are you here then?

239
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:19,625
不愁吃喝
The refreshments.

240
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:21,169
好吧，夠了
Okay, I think that's enough of that.

241
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:29,594
你把我的酒碰灑了，這可是條新褲子
You made me spill my drink.
These are brand new pants.

242
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:34,682
你懂的，等我回屋會把它喝完的
You know, I think I'll go
finish this in my room.

243
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:52,575
他快醒酒了
He's gonna come around.

244
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:53,784
沒用的
It's no use.

245
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:55,786
我去和他談談
I'm gonna go talk to him.

246
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:05,838
我們有兩位非常合適的16歲隊員
<i>We have two very fit 16-year-olds.</i>

247
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:09,258
當然，他們總是能夠提供優秀的競爭對手
<i>Of course, of course.
They always provide pretty good opponents.</i>

248
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:10,676
是啊
<i>Yes, yes, they do.</i>

249
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,637
- 還記得這一年嗎？
- 當然
<i>- Do you remember this year?
- Of course.</i>

250
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,307
我最喜歡的比賽之一，阿瑞納斯表現很棒
<i>One of my favorite years.
And one of my favorite Arenas.</i>

251
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:19,310
利用荒廢城市裏的碎石
<i>The use of the rubble in the ruined city...</i>

252
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,645
真令人興奮
<i>Very exciting.</i>

253
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:22,313
這個時刻
<i>And this moment here,</i>

254
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:24,982
你永遠不會忘記
<i>this moment is a moment
that you never forget.</i>

255
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:26,400
是的
<i>Yes.</i>

256
00:25:26,484 --> 00:25:29,570
當貢品變成勝利者的時刻
<i>The moment when a Tribute
becomes a victor.</i>

257
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:07,650
- 首先，你會被凍死
- 不會的，我可以點火
- You'd freeze to death first.
- No, because I'd light a fire.

258
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,360
是個找死的好辦法
That's a good way to get killed.

259
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:11,028
什麼找死的好辦法？
What's a good way to get killed?

260
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:15,074
有意思，怎麼不過來和我們一起聊聊？
Joy. Why don't you join us?

261
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:18,911
我只是給些生存建議
I was just giving some life-saving advice.

262
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:21,497
比如說？
Like what?

263
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,874
我剛才問他如何找到避難所
I was just asking about how to find shelter.

264
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:28,045
這些遲早有用，實際上你們還活著
Which would come in handy if,
in fact, you were still alive.

265
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:31,799
你怎麼找到避難所的？
How do you find shelter?

266
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:34,010
果醬給我
Pass the jam.

267
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,678
你怎麼找到避難所的？
How do you find shelter?

268
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:38,556
寶貝，讓我喘口氣吧
Give me a chance to wake up , sweetheart.

269
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:43,894
作為導師，這活可不輕鬆
This mentoring is very taxing stuff.

270
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,402
能把果醬遞給我嗎？
Can you pass the marmalade?

271
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:54,739
那可是紅木！
That is mahogany!

272
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:58,993
看看你，對餐具墊發什麼火
Look at you. Just killed a placemat.

273
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:02,747
你真想知道如何才能生存下來嗎？
You really want to know how to stay alive?

274
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,000
你得讓觀眾喜歡你
You get people to like you.

275
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:11,172
並不是你所期望的那樣
Not what you were expecting?

276
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:17,470
當你處於遊戲當中，你會挨餓挨凍
Well, when you're in the middle of
The Games and you're starving or freezing,

277
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:20,973
水、刀子，甚至是火柴
some water, a knife, or even some matches

278
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:23,559
都關乎你的生死
can mean the difference
between life and death.

279
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:27,063
這些東西取決於贊助商
And those things only come from sponsors.

280
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:31,734
想獲得贊助商的青睞，你必須讓觀眾喜歡你
And to get sponsors,
you have to make people like you.

281
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:38,240
寶貝，現在你離一個好的開頭並不遠了
And right now, sweetheart,
you're not off to a real good start.

282
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,576
就是那
There it is.

283
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:47,208
真壯觀！
It's huge!

284
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:49,835
不可思議
That's incredible.

285
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:16,028
皮塔，我愛你
Peeta, I love you.

286
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,831
來，來啊
Come on. Come on.

287
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:35,297
你最好留著這把刀，他清楚自己在做什麼
You better keep this knife.
He knows what he's doing.

288
00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:47,852
現在你已經看到他們了
<i>So now that you've seen them,</i>

289
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:50,729
你認為今年的新選手怎麼樣？
<i>what do you think about
this year's crop of recruits?</i>

290
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:54,024
有什麼值得期待的亮點嗎？
Are there any surprises
that we can expect this year?

291
00:28:54,108 --> 00:28:55,651
僅從抽籤來看真的很難說
It's really hard to tell just from a Reaping,

292
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:59,155
- 但我認為這將是一場非常有趣的混戰
- 沒錯
-but I think this is a very interesting mix.
- Yes.

293
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:01,449
而且這次還有一位邊遠區域的志願者
And whenever you have a volunteer
from an outlying district,

294
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:03,868
這絕對是個看點
<i>that's something you can't ignore.</i>

295
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:32,480
那是什麼？
What's that?

296
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:34,982
那是什麼？
What's that?

297
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:37,234
我們只是在談論在你見西納之前
We're just saying we might need
to hose you down again

298
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:39,445
可能需要再幫你沖洗一遍
before we take you to Cinna.

299
00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:50,206
替妹妹作為貢品，這是我見過的最勇敢的行為
That was one of the bravest things
I've ever seen. With your sister?

300
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:52,500
- 我叫西納
- 凱特尼斯
- My name's Cinna.
- Katniss.

301
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,044
對於你的遭遇感到很抱歉
I'm sorry that this happened to you,

302
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,087
我會盡我所能幫助你
and I'm here to help you
in any way that I can.

303
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,634
多數人只是恭喜我罷了
Most people just congratulate me.

304
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:04,011
我不會那麼想
Well, I don't see the point in that.

305
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:08,057
今晚有貢品巡遊活動
So tonight, they have the Tribute Parade.

306
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:12,102
我要讓全世界看到你有多漂亮
I'm gonna take you out
and show you off to the world.

307
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:13,938
你在這就是為了打扮我？
So you're here to make me look pretty?

308
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,356
我是為了讓觀眾對有個好印象
I'm here to help you make an impression.

309
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,276
通常他們根據貢品所在區域特點來打扮
Now, usually they dress people
in the clothes from their district.

310
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,737
- 好啊，我們那全是礦工
- 我不會那麼幹的
- Yeah, we're always coalminers.
- Yeah, but I don't wanna do that.

311
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,241
我要做的一定會令他們難忘
I wanna do something
that they're gonna remember.

312
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,868
他們跟你說過如何才能獲得贊助商嗎？
Did they explain
about trying to get sponsors?

313
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:30,663
說了，但我並不擅長交朋友
Yeah, but I'm not very good
at making friends.

314
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:32,331
走著瞧吧
We'll see.

315
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:36,126
我想有膽量的人
I just think somebody that brave

316
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:41,382
不應該穿得太隨便，對嗎？
shouldn't be dressed up
in some stupid costume, now should they?

317
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,219
希望如此
I hope not.

318
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:54,478
我保證這很安全
Okay, this is safe. I promise.

319
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:57,815
這不是真正的火焰，衣服是量身定做的
不會感到任何不適
It's not real fire. These suits are built
so you won't feel a thing.

320
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,149
看起來真的很合身
Looks pretty real to me.

321
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:00,818
就是這意思
Well, that's the idea.

322
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:01,902
準備好了嗎？
You ready?

323
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:04,446
- 別害怕
- 我不怕
- Don't be afraid.
- I'm not afraid.

324
00:31:24,842 --> 00:31:30,264
超過10萬人正迫不及待的等著觀賞今年的貢品
Over 100,000 people craning
to get a glimpse of this year's Tributes.

325
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:33,350
贊助商們也是第一次看到這些貢品
<i>And the sponsors get to see the Tributes
for the first time.</i>

326
00:31:33,434 --> 00:31:36,353
此刻的重要性無需贅言
The importance of this moment
cannot be overstated.

327
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:42,651
很好
Very nice.

328
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:47,948
第一輛戰車入場倒計時開始，15,14，13…
First chariot on my count, in 15, 14, 13...

329
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:53,954
來了，他們來啦，今年的貢品們
There they are. There they are.
This year's Tributes.

330
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:56,040
真令人激動
<i>It's the most exciting part.</i>

331
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:58,042
雞皮疙瘩都起來了
<i>It just gives you goose bumps.</i>

332
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,252
太喜歡這些設計師了
<i>And don't you love how the stylists,</i>

333
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:04,631
他們是怎麼把每個區域選手的特色
如此清晰呈現出來的？
they so clearly are able to
reflect the character of each district?

334
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,718
- 沒錯，第4區的選手來了
- 是啊
<i>- Right. Right. There's District 4.
- Yes.</i>

335
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:09,720
- 魚類裝扮
- 我看見了
<i>- Fishing.
- I get it.</i>

336
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,972
- 我喜歡
- 很不錯
<i>- I like it.
- That's very good.</i>

337
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:17,102
在他們後面有兩位電廠工人，對嗎？
And behind them,
we have two power plant workers. Right?

338
00:32:17,186 --> 00:32:18,562
然後呢…
And then...

339
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,899
最後那個是什麼？
What is that in the background?

340
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:49,843
來吧，他們喜歡這樣。
Come on. They'll love it.

341
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:57,935
耶！
Yeah!

342
00:32:58,018 --> 00:32:59,478
看到了嗎？我喜歡
<i>Now see that? I love that.</i>

343
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:02,272
兩個年輕人高舉緊握在一起的雙手
<i>Two young people
holding their hands up, saying,</i>

344
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:06,151
喊著「我為來自12區感到自豪，我們不會被忽視的」
<i>"I'm proud I come from District 12.
We will not be overlooked."</i>

345
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:07,403
- 當然不會
- 真棒我喜歡
- Nope.
- I love that!

346
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:10,197
所有人的注意力都集中在他們身上
<i>People are sure gonna be paying attention
to them right now.</i>

347
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:14,326
準備好了
And we're ready.

348
00:33:14,535 --> 00:33:15,911
斯諾總統，該你了
<i>President Snow, you're live.</i>

349
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:47,651
歡迎
<i>Welcome.</i>

350
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:52,823
歡迎
<i>Welcome.</i>

351
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:57,286
貢品們，歡迎你們的到來！
<i>Tributes, we welcome you.</i>

352
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:04,334
對於你們的勇氣和奉獻精神我們深表敬意
<i>We salute your courage and your sacrifice.</i>

353
00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:10,090
祝願你們
<i>And we wish you</i>

354
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:14,094
飢餓遊戲快樂
<i>Happy Hunger Games.</i>

355
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:18,432
希望好運永遠站在你這邊
<i>And may the odds be ever in your favor.</i>

356
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:33,030
簡直難以置信
That was amazing.

357
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:35,616
所有人都在討論你們
We are all
anybody's going to be talking about.

358
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,367
真夠大膽的
So brave.

359
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:39,578
你確信自己呆在我這團烈火旁會沒事嗎？
Are you sure you should be
near an open flame?

360
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:42,998
火焰道具嗎？你確信…
Fake flame? Are you sure you...

361
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:54,551
咱們上樓吧
Let's go upstairs.

362
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:00,432
每個區域都有屬於自己的樓層
So, each of the districts get their own floor.

363
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:03,977
因為你們來自12區，所以閣樓是你們的
And because you're from 12,
you get the penthouse.

364
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:12,486
來
Come on.

365
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:18,617
這是客廳
So this is the living room.

366
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:21,495
我知道
I know, I know.

367
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:24,998
你們的臥室在這
Now, your rooms are right over here.

368
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:28,835
在晚餐開始之前為什麼不先去洗個澡呢？
Why don't you go clean yourselves up
a little before dinner?

369
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:50,208
兩周內，會有23個人死掉
In two weeks, 23 of you will be dead.

370
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:52,252
只有一個倖存者
One of you will be alive.

371
00:36:52,336 --> 00:36:56,715
這取決於你們是否在意接下來的四天
Who that is depends on how well
you pay attention over the next four days,

372
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:59,384
尤其是我將要說的這些事
particularly to what I'm about to say.

373
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:02,554
首先，不要和其它選手打鬥
First, no fighting with the other Tributes.

374
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:04,514
在競技場你們有的是時間
You'll have plenty of time for that
in the Arena.

375
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:09,478
有四個必修練習，其餘的是個人訓練
There are four compulsory exercises.
The rest will be individual training.

376
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,564
我建議你們不要忽視生存技能
My advice is don't ignore the survival skills.

377
00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:14,232
每個人都想奪取利劍
Everybody wants to grab a sword,

378
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:17,027
但多數人都會死於自然因素
but most of you will die
from natural causes.

379
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:20,989
10%的人死於感染，20%的人死於脫水
10% from infection, 20% from dehydration.

380
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,950
暴曬能像刀子一樣輕易致人死地
Exposure can kill as easily as a knife.

381
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:58,485
- 傑森，我的刀呢？
- 我沒碰你的刀
- Jason, where's my knife, huh?
- I didn't touch your knife.

382
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:01,154
- 我就把刀放那了！
- 別碰我，我沒拿你的刀！
- I put my knife right there!
- Don't touch me. I didn't touch your knife!

383
00:38:01,238 --> 00:38:02,781
- 你拿了！
- 我沒拿！
- Yes, you took my knife!
- I didn't touch your knife!

384
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:04,449
- 你拿我的刀了，騙子！
- 我沒拿
- You took my knife, you liar!
- I didn't touch your knife.

385
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:05,534
- 騙子！
- 我沒拿！
- You liar!
- I didn't touch your knife!

386
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,744
臭小子！他拿我刀！
You little punk! He took my knife!

387
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:09,579
- 放開我！
- 我一直坐在這
- Get off me!
- I'm just sitting here.

388
00:38:09,663 --> 00:38:12,249
我現在就把我幹掉，臭小子！
I'll finish you right now, kid!

389
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:14,042
好啊，我在競技場等你
Actually, better yet, I'll wait for the Arena.

390
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:15,627
我第一個就去收拾你，給我小心點
You're the first one I get,
so watch your back.

391
00:38:19,423 --> 00:38:22,300
- 大家退後！
- 你知道你得罪誰了，臭小子！
- Everybody, back in line!
- You know who you're messing with, kid!

392
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:24,761
他是職業幹這個的，知道什麼意思嗎？
He's a Career. You know what that is?

393
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:26,847
- 從第1區來的
- 還有第2區
- From District 1.
- And 2.

394
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:30,767
他們18歲前都在專門的培訓機構訓練
然後作為志願者參賽
They train in a special academy
until they're 18. Then they volunteer.

395
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:34,062
這也就意味著他們很難對付
By that point, they're pretty lethal.

396
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:36,231
但他們沒有任何特殊待遇
But they don't receive any special treatment.

397
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,817
實際上，他們和你們呆在相同的房間內
In fact, they stay in the exact
same apartment as you do.

398
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,903
他們沒有餐後甜點可以吃，而你們卻有
And I don't think they let them have dessert.
And you can.

399
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:44,698
他們實力有多強？
So how good are they?

400
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:49,286
顯然他們很優秀，差不多每年都會獲勝，但…
Obviously they're pretty good.
They win it almost every year, but...

401
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:50,620
差不多
Almost.

402
00:38:50,871 --> 00:38:52,873
他們太自大了
...they can be arrogant.

403
00:38:53,457 --> 00:38:56,960
自大是個嚴重問題
And arrogance can be a big problem.

404
00:38:59,296 --> 00:39:01,298
聽說你會射箭
I hear you can shoot.

405
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,302
還好吧
I'm all right.

406
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:07,929
她射箭技術很好的，我爸買過她的松鼠
No, she's better than all right.
My father buys her squirrels.

407
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:12,058
他說她每次都是箭無虛發
He says she hits them
right in the eye every time.

408
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,645
- 皮塔很強壯
- 什麼？
- Peeta's strong.
- What?

409
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:18,148
他可以把100磅的麵粉舉過頭頂，我見過
He can throw a 100-pound sack
of flour right over his head. I've seen it.

410
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:20,609
好吧，我可不會用一袋麵粉殺人
Okay, well, I'm not gonna kill
anybody with a sack of flour.

411
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,319
但你可以用更好的方式獲勝
No, but you might have
a better chance of winning

412
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:23,653
如果有人拿刀過來
if somebody comes after you with a knife.

413
00:39:23,737 --> 00:39:26,782
我贏不了！贏不了！懂嗎？
I have no chance of winning!
None! All right?

414
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:35,081
這是真的，大家都知道
It's true. Everybody knows it.

415
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:40,420
你知道我媽怎麼說的嗎？
You know what my mother said?

416
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:43,840
他說12區可能會有一個勝者
She said District 12
might finally have a winner.

417
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:46,009
但她說的不是我
But she wasn't talking about me.

418
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:49,471
是你
She was talking about you.

419
00:39:54,935 --> 00:39:56,686
我不太餓
I'm not very hungry.

420
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:35,851
我也吃完了
I'm done, too.

421
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,520
把那個金屬東西扔過去
Throw that metal thing over there.

422
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:21,980
什麼？
What?

423
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:27,193
不，黑密斯說過不讓我們展露自己的才能
No. Haymitch said we're not supposed
to show our skills.

424
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:28,278
我不管黑密斯怎麼說的
I don't care what Haymitch said.

425
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:30,405
那幾個傢伙視你為砧板魚肉
Those guys are looking at you
like you're a meal.

426
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,573
扔過去
Throw it.

427
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:17,661
嗨
Hi.

428
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,621
嗨
Hey.

429
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:21,456
你怎麼做到的？
How did you do that?

430
00:42:21,915 --> 00:42:25,251
我過去經常在麵包店做蛋糕美化工作
I used to decorate the cakes
down at the bakery.

431
00:42:26,503 --> 00:42:27,921
給你看看
I'll show you.

432
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:31,257
看到了嗎？
See?

433
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,052
看到了
Yeah.

434
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:37,931
有人跟著你
Hey, I think you have a shadow.

435
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:07,961
明天他們會把你們一個接一個的帶進去
並且評估你們的能力
Tomorrow, they'll bring you in one by one
and evaluate you.

436
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,923
這點很重要，因為打分較高的意味著會有更多的贊助
This is important, because higher ratings
will mean sponsors.

437
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:14,718
是時候嶄露頭角了
This is the time to show them everything.

438
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:17,637
在那會有個弓，你一定要好好利用
There'll be a bow. Make sure you use it.

439
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:19,472
皮塔，你也一定要展示出你的力量
Peeta, you make sure to show your strength.

440
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:24,019
他們會從第1區開始，所以你們會排在最後
They'll start with District 1,
so the two of you will go last.

441
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:28,565
不知道該怎麼說，總之一定要讓他們記住你們
I don't know how else to put this.
Make sure they remember you.

442
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:42,287
凱特尼斯·埃弗丁
<i>Katniss Everdeen.</i>

443
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,425
嘿，凱特尼斯？
Hey, Katniss?

444
00:43:56,009 --> 00:43:57,802
好好表現
Shoot straight.

445
00:44:58,154 --> 00:44:59,781
凱特尼斯·埃弗丁
Katniss Everdeen.

446
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:02,909
12區的
District 12.

447
00:46:29,746 --> 00:46:30,914
嘿，嘿，嘿
Hey, hey, hey-

448
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:34,500
嘿，誰點的乳豬？誰點的乳豬？嘿！
Hey, who ordered this pig?
Who ordered this pig? Hey!

449
00:46:34,584 --> 00:46:35,877
你吃過乳豬沒？
Did you get some pig yet?

450
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:56,522
謝謝，僅供您參考
Thank you for your consideration.

451
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:04,447
- 你瘋了嗎？
- 我太生氣了
- Are you crazy?
- I just got mad.

452
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,657
生氣？
Mad?

453
00:47:06,366 --> 00:47:11,454
你得意識到你的不良舉動會影響整個團隊
不只是你自己
You realize that your actions reflect badly
on all of us. Notjust you.

454
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:13,081
他們只是想要一場好看的比賽，沒事的
They just want a good show. It's fine.

455
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:16,751
這麼沒禮貌你覺得會怎麼樣，西納！
會怎麼樣？
How about it's just bad manners, Cinna!
How about that?

456
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:21,256
好吧，我希望你注意到我們的形勢很嚴峻
Well, finally! I hope you noticed
we have a serious situation.

457
00:47:25,093 --> 00:47:27,136
幹得漂亮，寶貝
Nice shooting, sweetheart.

458
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:32,642
當你射中蘋果時他們什麼反應？
What did they do when you shot the apple?

459
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,061
他們都驚呆了
Well, they looked pretty startled.

460
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:36,437
耶
Yeah.

461
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:40,984
你說什麼來著？「謝謝…」
Now, what did you say? "Thanks for..."

462
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:42,652
- 謝謝，僅供您參考
- 「…供您參考」
- Thanks for your consideration.
-"...your consideration."

463
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:45,071
天才！天才！
Genius! Genius.

464
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:49,826
如果遊戲製作者想把我們踢出局的話
我想就沒這麼好笑了
I don't think we're gonna find this funny
if the Gamemakers decide to take it out...

465
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:51,369
踢誰？她？
On who? On her?

466
00:47:52,245 --> 00:47:53,663
還是他？
On him?

467
00:47:53,746 --> 00:47:56,749
我認為他們已經具備參賽資格了
放輕鬆，喝一杯
I think they already have.
Loosen your corset, have a drink.

468
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:00,420
我原本會不惜一切代價看到結果的
I would have given anything to see it.

469
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:04,173
正如你們所知道的，經過三天的仔細評估
<i>As you know, the Tributes were rated
on a scale of 1 to 12</i>

470
00:48:04,257 --> 00:48:07,093
1至12區的貢品評分結果出來了
<i>after three days of careful evaluation.</i>

471
00:48:07,302 --> 00:48:10,888
遊戲管理人得知了一個非常意外的…
<i>The Gamekeepers would like
to acknowledge that it was an exceptional...</i>

472
00:48:11,431 --> 00:48:16,311
來自第1區的，漫威，9分
<i>From District 1, Marvel, with a score of nine.</i>

473
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:19,939
來自第2區的，卡托，10分
<i>From District 2, Cato, with a score of 10.</i>

474
00:48:20,023 --> 00:48:22,233
克勞芙，10分
<i>Clove, with a score of 10.</i>

475
00:48:22,317 --> 00:48:25,528
來自第3區的…
來自第4區的…
<i>From District 3...
From District 4, with a score of...</i>

476
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:26,988
來自第7區的
<i>From District 7...</i>

477
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:28,740
來自第8區的…
<i>From District 8...</i>

478
00:48:29,449 --> 00:48:32,118
茹，7分
<i>And Rue with a score of seven.</i>

479
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:33,911
最後一個區了
<i>Now our final district.</i>

480
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:38,666
來自第12區的，皮塔·麥拉克
<i>From District 12. Peeta Mellark.</i>

481
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:45,173
8分
<i>A score of eight.</i>

482
00:48:46,466 --> 00:48:47,759
- 棒極了
- 皮塔！
- Excellent.
- Peeta!

483
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:48,885
精彩
Bravo.

484
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:51,179
- 我們能做到的
- 幹得好
- We can work with that.
- Good job.

485
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:54,974
最後一位
<i>And finally,</i>

486
00:48:57,477 --> 00:48:58,853
來自第12區的
<i>from District 12,</i>

487
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:03,232
凱特尼斯·埃弗丁
<i>Katniss E verdeen.</i>

488
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:08,488
分數是…
<i>With a score of...</i>

489
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:12,658
11分！
<i>Eleven.</i>

490
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:16,496
- 凱特尼斯！
- 難以置信！
- Katniss!
- Outstanding!

491
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:18,039
- 太好了！
- 11分？
- Yes!
- Eleven?

492
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:20,208
恭喜你
Congratulations.

493
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:21,626
我以為他們恨死我了
I thought they hated me.

494
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:23,044
他們喜歡你的勇氣
They must have liked your guts.

495
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:27,256
敬凱特尼斯·埃弗丁，燃燒女孩！
To Katniss Everdeen, The Girl on Fire!

496
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:30,176
天吶
Goodness. We are.

497
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:31,511
有個11分？
An 11?

498
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:32,970
她應得的
She earned it.

499
00:49:33,054 --> 00:49:35,098
她把箭射在你腦袋上
She shot an arrow at your head.

500
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:36,474
是蘋果上
Well, at an apple.

501
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:37,809
離你腦袋也不遠了
Near your head.

502
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:39,852
坐下
Sit down.

503
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:48,194
塞內卡，你想想為什麼我們要選出一名勝者？
Seneca, why do you think we have a winner?

504
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:52,031
您的意思是？
What do you mean?

505
00:49:52,949 --> 00:49:56,702
我的意思是為什麼要一個人活下來？
I mean, why do we have a winner?

506
00:49:59,288 --> 00:50:01,207
如果我們只是威脅其它的區域
I mean, if we just wanted to
intimidate the districts,

507
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:05,878
為什麼不隨機選24個人組到一起讓他們立刻比賽呢？
why not round up 24 of them at random
and execute them all at once?

508
00:50:05,962 --> 00:50:07,713
這樣多塊
Be a lot faster.

509
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:11,134
希望
Hope.

510
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:13,177
希望什麼？
Hope?

511
00:50:13,261 --> 00:50:14,345
希望
Hope.

512
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:18,307
這是唯一強於恐懼的
It is the only thing stronger than fear.

513
00:50:19,809 --> 00:50:23,604
一點希望可以讓人絕處逢生
希望太大的話是很危險的
A little hope is effective.
A lot of hope is dangerous.

514
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:26,983
火花可以有，但一定得能控制住
A spark is fine, as long as it's contained.

515
00:50:29,444 --> 00:50:30,445
所以…
So...

516
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:34,657
讓一切都在可掌控的範圍內
So contain it.

517
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:38,244
好的
Right.

518
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:41,581
她目不轉睛的盯著我身上的珠寶
So she's staring at all my jewels.
She cannot take her eyes off of them.

519
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:44,083
- 是啊，從上到下打量一遍
- 說真的，這太無禮了
- Well, look at all that that you're wearing.
- Frankly, it was rude.

520
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:46,794
黑密斯，一起來吧
Haymitch, you should join us.

521
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:49,338
晚餐有你的最愛
We're having some of
your favorite for dinner.

522
00:50:49,422 --> 00:50:50,590
那太好了
Lovely.

523
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:56,554
- 皮塔呢？
- 他在房間裏
- Where's Peeta?
- He's in his room.

524
00:50:56,637 --> 00:51:00,516
聽著，明天是最後一天
Now, listen, tomorrow's the last day.

525
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,227
比賽前他們讓我們和自己的隊員呆在一起
And they let us work with our own Tributes
right before The Games,

526
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:06,105
所以咱倆9點前得呆在一起
so you and I will be going down at 9:00.

527
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,108
他呢？
What about him?

528
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:13,279
他說從現在開始想一個人訓練
He says he wants to be trained
on his own from now on.

529
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:15,615
什麼？
What?

530
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:21,162
這個時候還說這種事，贏家只有一個，別忘了
This kind of thing does happen at this point.
There's only one winner, right?

531
00:51:27,627 --> 00:51:29,712
巧克力草莓還沒上來呢
We should have some
chocolate-covered strawberries.

532
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,631
- 噢，我喜歡吃
- 能不能行了
- Oh, my, yes.
- Please.

533
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:38,179
女士們，先生們，歡迎我們的節目主持人
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
your master of ceremonies,</i>

534
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:40,973
凱撒·弗裏克曼
<i>Caesar Flickerman!</i>

535
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:47,521
謝謝大家！謝謝！
<i>Thank you! Thank you!</i>

536
00:51:49,065 --> 00:51:54,946
歡迎，歡迎觀看第74屆年度飢餓遊戲大賽！
<i>Welcome, welcome, welcome
to the 74th Annual Hunger Games!</i>

537
00:51:56,155 --> 00:52:00,284
大約5分鐘後，他們所有人都將到舞台上來
<i>Now, in about five minutes,
they're all going to be out here.</i>

538
00:52:00,368 --> 00:52:02,954
所有你們瞭解的選手們齊聚一堂
<i>All of the Tributes that you've heard about.</i>

539
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:04,413
激動嗎？
<i>Are you excited?</i>

540
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:06,874
我聽不見！
<i>Let me hear it!</i>

541
00:52:10,211 --> 00:52:11,462
太棒了
Amazing.

542
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:14,674
我並不覺得怎麼樣
I don't feel amazing.

543
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:16,676
難道你不覺得自己很漂亮嗎？
Don't you know how beautiful you look?

544
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:18,594
不覺得，我也不知道怎麼才能讓別人喜歡上我
No. And I don't know
how to make people like me.

545
00:52:18,678 --> 00:52:21,264
- 你怎麼討別人喜歡的？
- 你已經讓我喜歡上你了
- How do you make people like you?
- Well, you made me like you.

546
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:22,640
這不一樣，我還不夠好
That's different. I wasn't trying.

547
00:52:22,723 --> 00:52:26,727
就是這樣，做自己就行，我會一直在那
Exactly. Just be yourself,
I'll be there the whole time.

548
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:30,356
你只要假裝和我說話就行，好嗎？
And just pretend
that you're talking to me. Okay?

549
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:31,691
好吧
Okay.

550
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:33,776
讓我們瞧瞧她是否真的光芒閃耀
<i>Let's see if she does indeed shine.</i>

551
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:37,280
掌聲歡迎格裏姆！
<i>Let's have a warm round of applause
for Glimmer!</i>

552
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:43,494
格裏姆，準備好了嗎？
<i>Glimmer, are you prepared?</i>

553
00:52:43,703 --> 00:52:45,830
當然，凱撒，早就準備好了
<i>Yes, Caesar, I am very prepared.</i>

554
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:48,666
我喜歡，你很自信
<i>I like it. That's assurance.
That's self-assurance.</i>

555
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:49,959
- 難道你不覺得嗎？
- 就像你看到的一樣…
<i>- Don't you think?
- And, as you can see...</i>

556
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:51,836
我穿的是我們自己設計的服裝
<i>...I'm wearing one of our own creations.</i>

557
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:54,714
請報以熱烈掌聲！
<i>A big round of applause!</i>

558
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:58,551
漫威！
Marvel!

559
00:53:01,721 --> 00:53:03,180
歡迎，克勞芙
<i>Welcome, Clove.</i>

560
00:53:03,264 --> 00:53:05,141
- 很榮幸代表我的區域參賽
- 你是個鬥士
- It's an honor representing my district.
- You're a fighter.

561
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:07,643
我準備好了，我可不友善，隨時出發
I'm prepared. I'm vicious. I'm ready to go.

562
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:10,062
卡托！
Cato!

563
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:13,649
我發現如果自己能夠接受現在的情況
I find that if I can apply myself
to the situation present,

564
00:53:13,733 --> 00:53:15,026
我一定會有辦法獲勝的
I will be able to figure it out.

565
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:18,571
謝謝，很高興見到你
非常感謝
<i>Thank you. Lovely to see you.
Thank you so much.</i>

566
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,492
你會爬樹
<i>Good. So you can climb trees.</i>

567
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:25,953
動作很敏捷，你是獵人麼？
You're pretty quick. And are you a hunter?

568
00:53:26,162 --> 00:53:27,621
還是收集果實的？
<i>A gatherer?</i>

569
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,506
從第12區來的，第12區…
<i>From District 12, District 12...</i>

570
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:40,760
被大家所熟知的燃燒女孩！
<i>You know her as The Girl on Fire!</i>

571
00:53:43,596 --> 00:53:46,682
我們稱她為可愛的凱特尼斯·埃弗丁
<i>Well, we know her
as the lovely Katniss Everdeen!</i>

572
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:04,950
歡迎！歡迎！
<i>Welcome! Welcome.</i>

573
00:54:07,536 --> 00:54:08,788
歡迎！
<i>Welcome.</i>

574
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:13,125
那天你的入場很特別
<i>Well, that was quite an entrance
you made the other day.</i>

575
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:17,296
你說什麼？
What?

576
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:21,092
我想某人有點緊張
I think someone's a little nervous.

577
00:54:22,927 --> 00:54:25,763
我是說在不久前貢品巡遊那天
I said that was quite an entrance
that you made

578
00:54:25,846 --> 00:54:27,598
你的入場方式很特別
at the Tribute Parade the other day.

579
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:29,850
想和我們談談這個嗎？
Do you want to tell us about it?

580
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:34,230
好，我只是希望別被燒死了
Well, I was just hoping that
I wouldn't burn to death.

581
00:54:42,738 --> 00:54:44,240
當你從戰車上下來的時候
When you came out of that chariot,

582
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:47,827
不得不說，我的心臟都停止跳動了
I have to say, my heart stopped.

583
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:50,830
你們也有類似的感覺吧？
Did any of you experience this as well?

584
00:54:50,913 --> 00:54:52,331
心跳停止了
My heart stopped.

585
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:56,710
我也一樣
So did mine.

586
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:01,799
和我說說那火焰吧，是真的嗎？
Now, tell me about the flames. Are they real?

587
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:03,008
是的
Yes.

588
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:11,475
事實上今天我也帶來了，你們想看嗎？
In fact, I'm wearing them today.
Would you like to see?

589
00:55:12,685 --> 00:55:15,312
等一下，這安全嗎？
Wait, wait, wait. Is it safe?

590
00:55:15,396 --> 00:55:16,689
當然
Yes.

591
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:18,357
觀眾們，你們是怎麼想的？
What do you think, folks?

592
00:55:20,276 --> 00:55:21,318
我想一定會同意
I think that's a yes.

593
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:50,556
淡定，淡定
Steady. Steady.

594
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:53,058
太好看了，謝謝
Lovely. Thank you.

595
00:55:55,478 --> 00:55:58,689
真了不起，凱特尼斯，太了不起了
That was really something.
Katniss, that was something.

596
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:01,150
了不起，謝謝你的表演
That was something. Thank you for that.

597
00:56:03,402 --> 00:56:05,779
還有一個問題
I have one more question for you.

598
00:56:07,323 --> 00:56:08,782
關於你的妹妹
It's about your sister.

599
00:56:11,494 --> 00:56:17,583
當你在抽籤日那天作為自願者替她參賽的時候
我們都很感動
We were all very moved, I think, when
you volunteered for her at the Reaping.

600
00:56:19,752 --> 00:56:22,296
她和你告別了嗎？
Did she come and say goodbye to you?

601
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,422
是的
Yes.

602
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:25,549
- 告別了
- 好的
- She did.
- She did.

603
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:31,430
最後你跟她說什麼了？
And what did you say to her in the end?

604
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:36,936
我告訴她會盡全力贏得比賽
I told her that I would try to win.

605
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:40,773
為了她
That I would try to win for her.

606
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:43,275
當然
Of course you did.

607
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,737
你會盡力的
And try you will.

608
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:50,533
女士們，先生們，來自第12區的
Ladies and gentlemen, from District 12,

609
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:54,119
凱特尼斯·埃弗丁，燃燒女孩！
Katniss Everdeen, The Girl on Fire!

610
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,545
你做到了，親愛的，不可思議
You did it, darling. That was incredible.

611
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:04,046
謝謝
Thank you.

612
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,590
幹得漂亮，寶貝
Nice job, sweetheart.

613
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:08,634
謝謝
Thank you.

614
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:10,302
衣服不錯
Nice dress, too.

615
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:15,015
- 沒說你
- 請大家歡迎皮塔·莫拉克
<i>- Not yours.
- Please welcome Peeta Mellark!</i>

616
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,190
皮塔，歡迎
<i>Peeta, welcome.</i>

617
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:27,403
你怎麼找到凱匹特的？別跟我說「看地圖找的」
<i>How are you finding The Capitol?
And don't say, "With a map. "</i>

618
00:57:27,486 --> 00:57:30,114
當然不是，這裏和家不一樣
<i>It's different.
It's very different than back home.</i>

619
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:33,075
不一樣，你指哪方面？舉個例子
<i>Different. In what way? Give us an example.</i>

620
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:35,494
好的，淋浴感覺挺古怪的
<i>Okay. Well, the showers here are weird.</i>

621
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:36,996
- 淋浴？
- 是的
- The showers?
- Yes.

622
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:38,664
咱們的淋浴不一樣
We have different showers.

623
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:42,751
有個問題想問你，凱撒
你聞我身上有玫瑰的味道嘛？
I have a question for you, Caesar.
Do I smell like roses to you?

624
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,672
- 再近一點
- 好
- Take a whiff?
- All right.

625
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:50,217
- 聞到了嗎？
- 嗯，我聞起來有玫瑰的味道嘛？
- You see?
- Yes. Do I smell like it?

626
00:57:57,057 --> 00:57:59,560
- 你的聞起來一定比我強
- 那是，我在這呆的比你久
- You definitely smell better than I do.
- Well, I've lived here longer.

627
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:00,811
有道理
That makes sense.

628
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,943
真有趣，皮塔，和我說說
Very funny. So, Peeta, tell me,

629
00:58:09,028 --> 00:58:11,614
在家有沒有對你來講意義特殊的女孩子？
is there a special girl back home?

630
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:13,324
沒，沒有，算不上
No. No. Not really.

631
00:58:13,574 --> 00:58:17,620
沒有？我一點也不信，看看這張臉
No? I don't believe it for a second.
Look at that face.

632
00:58:17,703 --> 00:58:21,665
像你這麼帥的小伙子，皮塔，招了吧
Handsome man like you. Peeta, tell me.

633
00:58:24,043 --> 00:58:25,544
額，有…
Well, there...

634
00:58:26,045 --> 00:58:29,381
我一直迷戀著一個女孩
There is this one girl
that I've had a crush on forever.

635
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:34,595
但實際上我並不認為她能認識我，直到抽籤日那天
But I don't think she actually recognized me
until the Reaping.

636
00:58:37,056 --> 00:58:39,224
我來告訴你吧，皮塔
Well, I'll tell you what, Peeta.

637
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:44,188
從競技場走出去你就會贏得想要的東西
You go out there and you win this thing,

638
00:58:44,647 --> 00:58:47,900
當你回家的時候，他一定會和你在一起的
and when you get home,
she'll have to go out with you.

639
00:58:48,484 --> 00:58:49,610
對嗎？朋友們
Right, folks?

640
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:56,492
謝謝，但我並不覺得獲勝能幫什麼忙
Thanks, but I don't think winning's
gonna help me at all.

641
00:58:56,575 --> 00:58:57,951
怎麼呢？
And why not?

642
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:03,749
因為她和我都在這
Because she came here with me.

643
00:59:08,003 --> 00:59:09,588
真不走運
<i>Well, that's bad luck.</i>

644
00:59:10,089 --> 00:59:11,548
的確是這樣
<i>Yeah, it is.</i>

645
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:16,595
- 祝你一切順利
- 謝謝
<i>- And I wish you all the best of luck.
- Thank you.</i>

646
00:59:17,513 --> 00:59:19,056
皮塔·莫拉克
<i>Peeta Mellark.</i>

647
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:21,725
來自第12區！
<i>District 12!</i>

648
00:59:25,104 --> 00:59:26,772
剛才是怎麼回事？
What the hell was that?

649
00:59:26,855 --> 00:59:28,857
之前你不和我說話，現在你又說喜歡我？
You don't talk to me,
and then you say you have a crush on me?

650
00:59:28,941 --> 00:59:31,026
你說你想獨立訓練，這是你想做的嗎？
You say you want to train alone?
Is that how you want to play?

651
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:32,736
住手！住手！
Stop it! Stop it!

652
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:33,987
- 咱倆把話說清楚！
- 嘿！
- Let's start right now!
- Hey!

653
00:59:35,948 --> 00:59:38,117
- 他在幫你
- 他讓我看起來很脆弱
- He did you a favor.
- He made me look weak.

654
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:42,037
他使你看起來令人滿意
像你這種情況，不能傷心，寶貝
He made you look desirable,
which in your case, can't hurt, sweetheart.

655
00:59:42,121 --> 00:59:43,163
他說的對，凱特尼斯
He's right, Katniss.

656
00:59:43,247 --> 00:59:44,456
當然沒錯
Of course I'm right.

657
00:59:44,707 --> 00:59:47,960
我可以出賣你們這對倒霉情侶
Now, I can sell the star-crossed lovers
from District 12...

658
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:49,545
我倆不是情侶
We are not star-crossed lovers.

659
00:59:49,628 --> 00:59:51,380
這是電視節目！
It's a television show!

660
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:55,217
和他相愛也許會得到贊助商的青睞
And being in love with that boy
might just get you sponsors,

661
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,636
這樣才能讓你們保命
which could save your damn life.

662
00:59:58,887 --> 01:00:01,598
好吧，你還在這幹什麼？
Okay. Why don't you get out of here?

663
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:05,310
也許明天我能拯救你們兩個
Maybe I can deliver you both
in one piece tomorrow.

664
01:00:05,394 --> 01:00:06,812
禮貌點！
Manners!

665
01:00:37,885 --> 01:00:39,178
你也沒睡？
You, too?

666
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:42,347
嘿
Hey.

667
01:00:42,765 --> 01:00:43,932
睡不著嗎？
Can't sleep?

668
01:00:44,016 --> 01:00:45,726
是啊，睡不著。
No. Of course not.

669
01:00:48,312 --> 01:00:50,397
對於你的追求我很抱歉
I'm sorry I went after you.

670
01:00:53,025 --> 01:00:55,360
你知道的，那只是在恭維你
You know, I meant that as a compliment.

671
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:57,070
我懂
I know.

672
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:09,958
聽他們的話吧
Listen to them.

673
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:13,003
嗯
Yeah.

674
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:19,885
我只是不想讓他們改變我
I just don't want them to change me.

675
01:01:22,805 --> 01:01:24,515
他們怎麼改變你了？
How would they change you?

676
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:31,188
不知道，他們使我變得有點不像我了
I don't know.
They'd turn me into something I'm not.

677
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:36,443
我只是不想在遊戲里變成另外一個人，你懂嗎？
I just don't want to be
another piece in their game, you know?

678
01:01:38,529 --> 01:01:39,988
你的意思是不殺任何人？
You mean you won't kill anyone?

679
01:01:42,324 --> 01:01:43,325
不
No.

680
01:01:44,076 --> 01:01:46,829
我是說我確定不會殺人的，和其他人一樣
I mean, I'm sure I would,
just like anybody else

681
01:01:46,912 --> 01:01:47,996
當比賽開始時
when the time came,

682
01:01:49,498 --> 01:01:53,418
我仍希望可以通過一種方式來向他們傳達
but I just keep wishing
that I could think of a way to show them

683
01:01:53,502 --> 01:01:55,254
我並不屬於他們
that they don't own me.

684
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:02,970
即使我要死了，我也要做我自己
If I'm gonna die, I want to still be me.

685
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,519
你覺得有道理嗎？
Does that make any sense?

686
01:02:10,602 --> 01:02:11,728
是啊
Yeah.

687
01:02:13,981 --> 01:02:16,191
只是我還沒想過這些
I just can't afford to think like that.

688
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:22,406
我還有妹妹
I have my sister.

689
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:25,951
我知道
Yeah, I know.

690
01:02:40,674 --> 01:02:42,926
咱們明天見吧
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

691
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:47,389
明天見
See you tomorrow.

692
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:17,502
他們會把所有物品放在豐饒角前面的開口處
（註：豐饒角，位於比賽起點的建築，四周放有生存物資。）
They'll put all kinds of stuff right in front,
right in the mouth of the Cornucopia.

693
01:03:17,586 --> 01:03:20,339
在那還有一把弓箭，你別去拿它
There'll even be a bow there. Don't go for it.

694
01:03:20,422 --> 01:03:21,673
為什麼不能拿？
Why not?

695
01:03:21,757 --> 01:03:23,967
遊戲剛開始會有一場大屠殺
你會被捲進去的
It's a bloodbath.
They're trying to pull you in.

696
01:03:24,051 --> 01:03:25,469
這不是你一個人的遊戲
That's not your game.

697
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:29,514
你要轉身快跑，找個高地，尋找水源
You turn, run, find high ground,
look for water.

698
01:03:29,598 --> 01:03:31,808
水是你最好的新朋友
Water's your new best friend.

699
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:36,605
別提前走基座上走下來，他們會把你吹上天的
Don't step off that pedestal early
or they'll blow you sky high.

700
01:03:36,688 --> 01:03:37,940
我不會的
I won't.

701
01:03:49,993 --> 01:03:53,080
凱特尼斯，你能做到的
Katniss, you can do this.

702
01:04:01,213 --> 01:04:02,422
謝謝
Thanks.

703
01:04:07,302 --> 01:04:08,929
伸出手臂
Give me your arm.

704
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:14,434
伸出手臂
Give me your arm.

705
01:04:20,899 --> 01:04:22,734
- 伸出手臂
- 這是什麼？
- Give me your arm.
- What is that?

706
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:26,989
追蹤器
Your tracker.

707
01:04:28,532 --> 01:04:29,533
準備就緒
We're up.

708
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:31,118
準備就緒
We're up!

709
01:04:33,245 --> 01:04:37,499
好的，還有不到一分鐘，夥計們
最後檢查一遍
All right. Less than a minute, people.
Final checks.

710
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:39,918
還有15秒，準備起飛
There are 15 out. They are flying.

711
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:18,790
這
Here.

712
01:05:39,102 --> 01:05:40,437
謝謝
Thank you.

713
01:05:49,029 --> 01:05:50,530
30秒
<i>Thirty seconds.</i>

714
01:05:57,996 --> 01:06:02,000
我被禁止賭博
如果我可以下個賭注的話，一定賭你贏
I'm not allowed to bet,
but if I could, I'd bet on you.

715
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:15,305
20秒
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

716
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:29,444
10秒
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

717
01:06:55,303 --> 01:06:57,597
好的，他們進管道了
Okay, they're in the tubes.

718
01:07:37,888 --> 01:07:41,933
50, 49, 48, 47,

719
01:07:42,017 --> 01:07:46,354
46, 45, 44, 43,

720
01:07:46,438 --> 01:07:49,858
42, 41, 40,
42, 41, 40,

721
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:53,862
<i>39, 38, 37, 36,</i>

722
01:07:53,945 --> 01:07:58,158
<i>35, 34, 33, 32,</i>

723
01:07:58,617 --> 01:08:02,579
<i>31, 30, 29, 28,</i>

724
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:06,041
<i>27, 26, 25,</i>

725
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:09,169
<i>24, 23, 22...</i>

726
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:23,530
又是一次熟悉的噩耗
And, of course,
there's the familiar "boom" of the cannon,

727
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:26,658
屏幕上標記的是挑戰失敗的貢品
which marks the end
of another fallen Tribute.

728
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:28,451
8
...eight...


729
01:11:29,536 --> 01:11:30,537
9
...nine...


730
01:11:31,996 --> 01:11:32,997
10
...10...


731
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:35,208
11
...11...


732
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:38,044
12
...12.


733
01:13:20,605 --> 01:13:21,606
25？收到
Twenty-five? Got it.

734
01:13:26,361 --> 01:13:27,362
他在移動
He's moving now.

735
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:03,207
在第一個8小時內有13名選手挑戰失敗
Well, that makes 13 gone
in the first eight hours.

736
01:15:03,374 --> 01:15:06,669
克勞迪亞斯，我想我看到一個正在逐步形成聯盟
And Claudius,
I think I see an alliance forming.

737
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:13,843
等下！你看到她的表情了嗎？
Wait! Did you see the look on her face?

738
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:15,803
- 你怎麼知道她在那？
- 看到火光了嗎？
- How stupid can you get?
- A fire?

739
01:15:15,887 --> 01:15:19,349
「不！求求你，別殺我！不！」
"Oh, no! Please don't kill me! Oh, no!"

740
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:21,768
真令人印象深刻
That's actually a good impression.

741
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:23,269
嘿，小白臉！
Hey, lover boy!

742
01:15:24,771 --> 01:15:27,190
- 你確定她走的是這條路嗎？
- 我確定
- You sure she went this way?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

743
01:15:28,232 --> 01:15:29,484
最好沒錯
You better be.

744
01:15:29,567 --> 01:15:32,528
那是她佈置的陷阱，我在那後面找到的
Yeah, that was her snare
we found back there.

745
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:40,495
我們現在怎麼不把他幹掉呢？
Are you sure we shouldn't just kill him now?

746
01:15:40,578 --> 01:15:42,413
算了，有他在我們才能找到那女孩
Nah. He's our best chance of finding her.

747
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:44,874
走吧
Let's go.

748
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,145
先生？
Sir?

749
01:16:08,231 --> 01:16:10,441
她一直在競技場的邊緣徘徊
She is almost at the edge.

750
01:16:10,525 --> 01:16:13,111
離她最近的貢品也有2公里遠
<i>Two kilometers away
from the nearest Tribute.</i>

751
01:16:13,194 --> 01:16:14,529
咱們得讓她掉頭
<i>Let's turn her around.</i>

752
01:17:15,214 --> 01:17:18,259
另一個準備，開始計時，1，2
Cueing another. On my count. One, two...

753
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:32,273
她往左側去了
She's heading towards the left flank.

754
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:34,692
好的，能在那放棵樹嗎？
Okay. Can you give me a tree right there?

755
01:17:34,776 --> 01:17:37,403
可以，準備放樹
Sure. Cueing tree.

756
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:30,790
她在那
She's almost there.

757
01:18:44,303 --> 01:18:46,639
露西婭，準備加農炮
Lucia, get a cannon ready.

758
01:18:58,693 --> 01:19:00,194
在那！她在那！
There she is! There she is!

759
01:19:02,947 --> 01:19:05,449
- 她是我的！
- 先到先得！
- She's mine!
- Not if I get her first!

760
01:19:09,996 --> 01:19:12,123
- 你往哪跑？
- 她是我的！
- Where you gonna go?
- Mine!

761
01:19:12,206 --> 01:19:14,750
把池塘翻個遍，一定要找到她
Fish out of the pond!
And someone found her.

762
01:19:21,132 --> 01:19:23,134
- 她在那！
- 耶！
- There she is!
- Yeah!

763
01:19:28,139 --> 01:19:29,599
我們來啦！
Here we go!

764
01:19:35,438 --> 01:19:37,815
- 往哪跑？
- 抓住他，卡托！
- Where you going, huh?
- Get her, Cato!

765
01:19:38,024 --> 01:19:39,483
你以為能跑哪去？
Where do you think you're going?

766
01:19:42,528 --> 01:19:44,405
往哪跑，寶貝
Where you going, baby?

767
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:46,908
3點鐘方向
Three o'clock.

768
01:19:49,452 --> 01:19:51,537
- 你去哪，燃燒女孩？
- 我們抓到她了！
- Where you going, Girl on Fire?
- We got her!

769
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:53,164
埃弗丁小姐，我會抓住你的！
Miss Everdeen, I'm gonna get you!

770
01:19:53,247 --> 01:19:54,582
爬那麼高無濟於事的，凱特尼斯
That's not gonna help you up there, Katniss.

771
01:19:54,665 --> 01:19:56,375
你想往哪去啊？
Where are you going?

772
01:19:56,667 --> 01:19:59,211
- 去抓她！
- 你能行的
- Go get her, man!
- You are so done.

773
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:01,297
卡托，上！
Just get her, Cato!

774
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:02,381
- 他來抓你了，凱特尼斯
- 看把她急的
- He's gonna get you, Katniss.
- Look at her scurry.

775
01:20:03,382 --> 01:20:04,383
快逮到她了
Right up there.

776
01:20:05,259 --> 01:20:06,969
- 殺了她！
- 繼續爬啊
- Kill her!
- Just go, keep going!

777
01:20:08,095 --> 01:20:09,847
加油，卡托
- Go, Cato.
- Come on, Cato.

778
01:20:09,931 --> 01:20:10,932
- 她就在那了
- 卡托！加油！卡托！
- She's right there.
- Go, Cato! Come on, Cato!

779
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:12,058
快到了
You got this.

780
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:13,100
爬啊！
Go! He's got this.

781
01:20:13,184 --> 01:20:15,686
- 殺了她，卡托！抓住她，卡托！
- 上啊！
- Kill her, Cato! Just get her, Cato!
- Go! Go!

782
01:20:15,770 --> 01:20:17,313
- 把她弄下來！
- 快爬啊！
- Take her down!
- Go! Go!

783
01:20:17,939 --> 01:20:19,273
- 就快到了，卡托！
- 加油，殺了她！
- You got this, Cato!
- Come on, kill her!

784
01:20:19,357 --> 01:20:20,775
我來取你小命了！
I'm coming for you!

785
01:20:20,858 --> 01:20:22,318
加油，卡托！
Come on, Cato!

786
01:20:26,489 --> 01:20:28,157
我自己來
I'll do it myself.

787
01:20:35,289 --> 01:20:36,791
讓我來
Give me that before...

788
01:20:36,874 --> 01:20:38,918
- 把她射下來
- 加油，射啊！
- Get her.
- Come on. Come on, come on!

789
01:20:41,671 --> 01:20:44,048
你們應該把刀扔上來試試！
Maybe you should throw the sword!

790
01:20:44,507 --> 01:20:46,425
我們等她下來吧
Let's just wait her out.

791
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:52,598
過段時間她會下來的，否則就得餓死
She's gotta come down at some point.
It's that or starve to death.

792
01:20:52,682 --> 01:20:53,891
然後我們再找她算賬
We'll just kill her then.

793
01:20:58,062 --> 01:20:59,230
好的
Okay.

794
01:21:00,231 --> 01:21:01,732
誰去生把火
Somebody make a fire.

795
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:16,247
- 我們就在這露營
- 快去生把火
- Let's make camp over here!
- Hurry up with the fire.

796
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:15,639
小孩子
Boys.

797

謝謝
Thank you.

01:25:05,142 --> 01:25:08,646
克勞迪亞斯，我想那些是殺人蜂，沒錯吧？
Claudius, I think those are tracker jackers
Am I wrong?

801
01:25:11,232 --> 01:25:14,026
- 它們相當有殺傷力
- 很致命
- Those things are very lethal.
- Very.

802
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:15,194
對於不瞭解的朋友，我再介紹一下
For those of you who don't know,

803
01:25:15,277 --> 01:25:20,532
殺人蜂是經過基因改良過的黃蜂
毒液可以引起灼熱似的疼痛
tracker jackers are genetically engineered
wasps whose venom causes searing pain,

804
01:25:20,991 --> 01:25:26,163
強勁的幻覺，在極端情況下甚至可以導致死亡
<i>powerful hallucinations,
and in extreme cases, death.</i>

805
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:26,135
跑！
Run!

806
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:28,262
跑！
Run!

807
01:28:29,513 --> 01:28:30,681
快跑啊！
Run!

808
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:33,100
凱特尼斯，快跑！
Katniss, go!

809
01:28:33,934 --> 01:28:36,687
離開這，快走！
你在想什麼，快走！
Get out of here! Go!
What are you doing? Go!

810
01:28:48,407 --> 01:28:52,995
不但極具殺傷力，而且只需一隻殺人蜂的毒液
Not only is it lethal,
but the venom of a tracker jacker sting

811
01:28:54,037 --> 01:28:55,914
也能令人產生強勁的幻覺
can produce powerful hallucinations.

812
01:29:56,433 --> 01:30:00,729
媽媽，別只是坐在那看我！
說點什麼吧！
Mom, don't just sit there and look at me!
Please say something!

813
01:30:01,313 --> 01:30:03,065
凱特尼斯，快跑！
Katniss, go!

814
01:30:04,525 --> 01:30:07,277
離開這，快走！
你在想什麼，快走！
Get out of here! Go!
What are you doing? Go!

815
01:31:08,171 --> 01:31:09,256
茹？
Rue?

816
01:31:12,968 --> 01:31:15,387
沒事，我不會傷害你的
It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you.

817
01:31:33,030 --> 01:31:34,531
我的也給你吧？
You want mine, too?

818
01:31:35,574 --> 01:31:37,200
不用了
No, that's okay.

819
01:31:38,285 --> 01:31:39,369
給
Here.

820
01:31:40,329 --> 01:31:41,496
謝謝
Thanks.

821
01:31:46,543 --> 01:31:48,170
我昏迷多久了？
How long was I asleep?

822
01:31:48,962 --> 01:31:52,174
好幾天了，我幫你換了兩次樹葉
Couple of days. I changed your leaves twice.

823
01:31:54,384 --> 01:31:55,719
謝謝
Thank you.

824
01:31:57,429 --> 01:31:59,765
我昏迷這幾天都發生什麼了？
So what happened while I was out?

825
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:03,101
第1區的女孩和第10區的男孩
The girl from 1 and the boy from 10.

826
01:32:07,147 --> 01:32:09,399
和我一起來的男孩呢？
And the boy from my district?

827
01:32:10,317 --> 01:32:13,528
他沒事，我想他沿著河邊往下遊走了
Yeah, he's okay.
I think he's down by the river.

828
01:32:16,907 --> 01:32:18,617
那些都是真的嗎？
Is all of that true?

829
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:19,785
什麼？
What?

830
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:21,870
你們倆？
You and him?

831
01:32:23,455 --> 01:32:25,457
卡托和其他人在哪？
So where are Cato and the others?

832
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:28,585
他們把所有補給品放在河邊
They got all their supplies
down by the lake.

833
01:32:28,669 --> 01:32:30,837
堆成很大的錐型
<i>It's piled up in this great big pyramid.</i>

834
01:32:31,421 --> 01:32:33,256
聽起來很誘人
That sounds tempting.

835
01:32:49,106 --> 01:32:51,149
這些樹枝可以很快的燃燒起來
Now, this green stuff
is gonna smoke like crazy,

836
01:32:51,233 --> 01:32:53,944
一旦你點燃它了，就接著去點燃下一堆
so as soon as you light it,
move on to the next fire.

837
01:32:54,027 --> 01:32:56,530
點燃最後這堆後，我會在那跟你會合
Light this one last,
and I'll meet you back over there.

838
01:32:56,613 --> 01:32:57,823
好的
Right.

839
01:33:01,118 --> 01:33:04,204
然後當他們去抓我們的時候，我會摧毀他們的補給品
And then I'll destroy their stuff
while they're chasing us.

840
01:33:04,287 --> 01:33:06,540
一旦我們當中的一個被抓了，需要一個暗號
We need a signal
in case one of us gets held up.

841
01:33:06,623 --> 01:33:07,791
好，什麼暗號？
Okay. Like what?

842
01:33:10,085 --> 01:33:11,753
看著
Here. Watch this.

843
01:33:17,467 --> 01:33:20,387
學舌鳥，太棒了
Mockingjays. That's great.

844
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:23,390
在家的時候，我們一直用它們做暗號
Back home,
we use them to signal all the time.

845
01:33:28,311 --> 01:33:29,521
你來試試
You try.

846
01:33:38,989 --> 01:33:40,699
很好，一旦我們聽見這聲音
Okay, so if we hear that,

847
01:33:40,782 --> 01:33:44,286
就表示我倆都沒事，很快便會再見面的
it means we're okay
and we'll be back real soon.

848
01:33:44,369 --> 01:33:45,620
我們會沒事的
We're gonna be okay.

849
01:33:51,543 --> 01:33:54,504
晚餐見
Hey, I'll see you for supper.

850
01:33:56,006 --> 01:33:57,966
- 好的
- 好的
-Okay-
-Okay-

851
01:34:26,328 --> 01:34:29,706
夥計們，看吶！這呢
過來，看這邊！
Guys. Guys, look! Over here.
Come on, come on. Look!

852
01:34:33,877 --> 01:34:34,920
我們走
Let's go.

853
01:34:35,337 --> 01:34:38,089
你要保持警惕在我們回來之前別離開
You stay guard and don't move
until we can get back.

854
01:35:06,827 --> 01:35:09,955
我倒想看看她能否搞定這個陷阱
I want to see if she's gonna figure out
this booby trap.

855
01:35:10,247 --> 01:35:12,541
是啊，看起來這一大堆好吃的旁邊
Yes. It seems they've reburied their mines

856
01:35:12,624 --> 01:35:15,210
埋了不少地雷
<i>around that big pile of goodies.</i>

857
01:35:27,430 --> 01:35:30,350
她一定能搞定的，不是麼？
<i>She's certainly figured it out, hasn't she?</i>

858
01:37:38,186 --> 01:37:40,313
我不知道發生了什麼
I don't know what happened.

859
01:37:40,397 --> 01:37:43,024
- 究竟是怎麼回事？
- 我不知道
- What the hell happened?
- I don't know!

860
01:37:43,566 --> 01:37:44,567
補給品全毀了！
Our stuff!

861
01:38:41,458 --> 01:38:42,667
凱特尼斯！
Katniss!

862
01:38:44,377 --> 01:38:45,962
凱特尼斯！
Katniss!

863
01:38:47,547 --> 01:38:49,299
凱特尼斯，救命！
Katniss, help!

864
01:38:50,508 --> 01:38:51,926
凱特尼斯！
Katniss!

865
01:38:56,556 --> 01:38:58,933
凱特尼斯！救救我！
Katniss! Help!

866
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:01,352
凱特尼斯！
Katniss!

867
01:39:02,479 --> 01:39:03,688
凱特尼斯！
Katniss!

868
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:05,648
沒事了
It's okay. It's okay.

869
01:39:14,866 --> 01:39:18,244
沒事的，你很好，明白嗎？
You're okay. You're okay. You're fine. See?

870
01:39:47,357 --> 01:39:49,484
會好起來的
It's okay. You're okay.

871
01:39:49,859 --> 01:39:52,445
一切都會好的
You're okay. You're okay.

872
01:40:00,036 --> 01:40:02,038
你把他們的食物毀掉了嗎？
Did you blow up the food?

873
01:40:04,666 --> 01:40:06,209
片甲不留
Every bit of it.

874
01:40:09,546 --> 01:40:10,713
太好了
Good.

875
01:40:12,757 --> 01:40:14,634
你贏定了
You have to win.

876
01:40:23,893 --> 01:40:25,562
你能唱歌給我聽嗎？
Can you sing?

877
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:30,567
好的
Okay.

878
01:40:37,991 --> 01:40:41,911
在草叢深處
<i>Deep in the meadow</i>

879
01:40:42,412 --> 01:40:46,082
在柳樹下
<i>Under the willows</i>

880
01:40:46,833 --> 01:40:49,669
草墊床
<i>A bed of grass</i>

881
01:40:50,253 --> 01:40:54,299
軟軟的綠枕頭
<i>A soft green pillow</i>

882
01:40:55,258 --> 01:40:58,052
把頭放上去
<i>Lay down your head</i>

883
01:40:58,761 --> 01:41:02,056
閉上你的眼
<i>and close your eyes</i>

884
01:41:02,932 --> 01:41:07,937
當你睜開眼，陽光……
<i>And when they open, the sun...</i>

885
01:41:56,778 --> 01:41:57,779
對不起
I'm sorry.

886
01:41:59,989 --> 01:42:01,491
對不起
I'm sorry.

887
01:43:27,155 --> 01:43:28,745
[11區]
[DISTRICT 11]

888
01:44:57,667 --> 01:45:00,211
別殺她，這樣只能多一個犧牲者而已
<i>Don't kill her. You'll just create a martyr.</i>

889
01:45:00,294 --> 01:45:01,587
看起來我們已經有一個了
Well, it seems we've already got one.

890
01:45:01,671 --> 01:45:04,966
關於11區的傳言我也聽說了
如果按我說的做可以避免把你捲入是非
I hear these rumors out of District 11.
This could get away from you.

891
01:45:05,049 --> 01:45:06,217
你想怎麼樣？
What do you want?

892
01:45:07,093 --> 01:45:08,719
那有很多憤怒的群眾
You have a lot of anger out there.

893
01:45:08,803 --> 01:45:11,848
我想你應該知道如何處理這幫暴徒
之前你也經歷過
I know you know how to handle a mob.
You've done it before.

894
01:45:11,931 --> 01:45:16,769
如果你不能嚇跑他們，就支持他們吧
If you can't scare them,
give them something to root for.

895
01:45:17,812 --> 01:45:18,813
比如？
Such as?

896
01:45:21,774 --> 01:45:23,443
浪漫的愛情
Young love.

897
01:45:24,819 --> 01:45:26,946
你怎麼像個窮鬼一樣？
So you like an underdog?

898
01:45:27,029 --> 01:45:28,322
大家都喜歡窮鬼
Everyone likes an underdog.

899
01:45:28,406 --> 01:45:29,657
我不喜歡
I don't.

900
01:45:31,367 --> 01:45:34,454
你去過那嗎？10區？11區？12區？
Have you been out there? 10? 11? 12?

901
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:37,915
沒去過
Not personally. No.

902
01:45:37,999 --> 01:45:39,417
我去過
Well, I have.

903
01:45:40,585 --> 01:45:42,545
那有很多窮人
There are lots of underdogs.

904
01:45:42,628 --> 01:45:44,297
煤也不少
Lots of coal, too.

905
01:45:44,630 --> 01:45:47,967
農作物，礦產，都是我們需要的東西
Grow crops, minerals, things we need.

906
01:45:49,802 --> 01:45:52,054
窮人很多
There are lots of underdogs.

907
01:45:53,055 --> 01:45:55,016
我想如果你看到他們
And I think if you could see them,

908
01:45:56,392 --> 01:45:58,895
就不會支持他們了
you would not root for them either.

909
01:46:01,355 --> 01:46:02,732
我欣賞你
I like you.

910
01:46:06,068 --> 01:46:07,653
當心點
Be careful.

911
01:46:18,331 --> 01:46:20,583
貢品請注意，貢品請注意
<i>Attention, Tributes. Attention.</i>

912
01:46:20,666 --> 01:46:25,505
只有1名獲勝者的比賽規則暫定廢除
<i>The regulations requiring a single victor
have been suspended.</i>

913
01:46:25,588 --> 01:46:27,924
從現在起，允許有兩名勝者
<i>From now on, two victors may be crowned,</i>

914
01:46:28,007 --> 01:46:31,677
只要兩人來自於同一區
<i>if both originate from the same district.</i>

915
01:46:31,761 --> 01:46:34,222
僅此通告
<i>This will be the only announcement.</i>

916
01:46:35,598 --> 01:46:36,891
皮塔
Peeta.

917
01:47:37,827 --> 01:47:40,329
天吶！皮塔！皮塔！
Oh, my God! Peeta! Peeta!

918
01:47:43,416 --> 01:47:44,417
嗨
Hi.

919
01:47:48,212 --> 01:47:49,672
沒事了
It's okay.

920
01:48:04,687 --> 01:48:06,105
怎麼弄的？
What was it?

921
01:48:06,397 --> 01:48:07,690
刀傷
A sword.

922
01:48:09,317 --> 01:48:10,860
糟透了，不是麼？
It's bad, huh?

923
01:48:11,986 --> 01:48:13,696
會好起來的
It's gonna be fine.

924
01:48:26,375 --> 01:48:27,835
凱特尼斯
Katniss.

925
01:48:31,505 --> 01:48:32,965
- 凱特尼斯
- 不！
- Katniss.
- No!

926
01:48:34,300 --> 01:48:38,095
我不會離開你
再也不會那麼做了
I'm not gonna leave you.
I'm not gonna do that.

927
01:48:45,686 --> 01:48:47,104
為什麼？
Why not?

928
01:49:07,333 --> 01:49:09,919
在這沒人會找到你
Nobody's gonna find you in here.

929
01:49:10,002 --> 01:49:11,962
他們已經發現我一次了
They already found me.

930
01:49:16,092 --> 01:49:17,968
我們會給你弄些藥
We'll just get you some medicine.

931
01:49:18,052 --> 01:49:19,887
凱特尼斯，我沒弄到多少降落傘補給
Katniss, I don't get many parachutes.

932
01:49:20,846 --> 01:49:22,098
我們會有辦法的
We'll figure something out.

933
01:49:23,182 --> 01:49:24,517
比如說？
Like what?

934
01:49:25,559 --> 01:49:26,936
會有的
Something.

935
01:50:17,433 --> 01:50:19,959
[這也算接吻嗎？ -黑密斯]
[YOU CALL THAT A KISS? - H]

936
01:50:28,289 --> 01:50:30,833
- 是藥嗎？
- 不，是湯
- Medicine?
- No. Soup.

937
01:50:31,667 --> 01:50:32,668
我來餵你吧
I'll do it.

938
01:50:43,345 --> 01:50:44,847
味道真好
That's nice.

939
01:50:46,849 --> 01:50:48,684
曾經你有恩於我
You fed me once.

940
01:50:51,771 --> 01:50:53,689
我一直在想
I think about that all the time.

941
01:50:55,483 --> 01:50:57,401
我怎麼能把麵包丟給你呢
How I tossed you that bread.

942
01:50:57,485 --> 01:50:59,153
- 皮塔
- 我應該把它送給你
- Peeta...
- I should have gone to you.

943
01:50:59,236 --> 01:51:01,489
我應該冒雨走到你面前然後……
I should have just gone out in the rain and...

944
01:51:04,575 --> 01:51:06,035
你好像有點發燒
You feel hot.

945
01:51:08,662 --> 01:51:10,706
我還記得第一次見到你是什麼樣子
I remember the first time I saw you.

946
01:51:11,957 --> 01:51:13,876
你梳兩條辮子
Your hair was in two braids instead of one.

947
01:51:15,419 --> 01:51:18,464
我還記得當你在音樂課唱歌的時候
And I remember when you sang
in the music assembly.

948
01:51:18,547 --> 01:51:20,925
老師說「誰知道山谷之歌？」
"Who knows The Valley Song?」</i>
<i>The teacher said,

949
01:51:21,008 --> 01:51:23,135
你第一個把手舉起來
And your hand shot straight up.

950
01:51:23,219 --> 01:51:24,303
別說了
Stop.

951
01:51:24,553 --> 01:51:28,390
從那之後，我每天都會看著你回家
After that,
I watched you going home every day.

952
01:51:31,393 --> 01:51:32,728
每天都是
Every day-

953
01:51:40,569 --> 01:51:42,404
說點什麼吧
Well, say something.

954
01:51:45,491 --> 01:51:47,910
我不擅長和別人交流
I'm not good at saying something.

955
01:51:49,829 --> 01:51:51,205
那就到這來
Then come here.

956
01:51:52,873 --> 01:51:54,083
來吧
Please.

957
01:52:06,303 --> 01:52:08,180
即使我沒有…
Even if I don't make it...

958
01:52:09,098 --> 01:52:10,182
別說了
Stop it.

959
01:52:16,438 --> 01:52:18,524
貢品請注意，貢品請注意
<i>Attention, Tributes. Attention.</i>

960
01:52:19,275 --> 01:52:22,194
明天日出時分，在豐饒角
<i>Commencing at sunrise,
there will be a feast tomorrow</i>

961
01:52:22,278 --> 01:52:23,863
會有一場盛筵
<i>at the Cornucopia.</i>

962
01:52:23,946 --> 01:52:27,032
想參加的話並不輕鬆
<i>This will be no ordinary occasion.</i>

963
01:52:27,116 --> 01:52:30,870
你們每個人都要拿出真本事
<i>Each of you needs something desperately.</i>

964
01:52:30,953 --> 01:52:34,915
我們是很慷慨的
<i>And we plan to be generous hosts.</i>

965
01:52:34,999 --> 01:52:36,542
會有你需要的藥品
Your medicine.

966
01:52:36,625 --> 01:52:37,626
你別自己去
You're not going alone.

967
01:52:37,793 --> 01:52:39,879
你需要它，你現在無法行走
Yeah? You need it, and you can't walk.

968
01:52:39,962 --> 01:52:42,715
凱特尼斯，別為了我拿自己的性命冒險，我不會讓你去的
Katniss, you're not gonna risk
your life for me. I'm not gonna let you.

969
01:52:42,798 --> 01:52:45,801
如果換做是你，也會這麼做，不是嗎？
You would do it for me. Wouldn't you?

970
01:52:47,761 --> 01:52:49,471
為什麼要這麼做？
Why are you doing this?

971
01:52:53,071 --> 01:52:55,928
（註：之前的降落傘裏導師的
紙條上寫著「這也算是接吻嗎？」）

972
01:52:56,656 --> 01:53:01,500
（這句話的意思是提醒凱特尼斯即便做秀也要做足，
要想活命，必須和皮塔在一起，）

973
01:53:02,007 --> 01:53:05,517
（於是凱特尼斯回到山洞又給了皮塔深深的一吻。）

974
01:53:07,990 --> 01:53:10,242
現在我更不可能讓你去了
Now there's no way I'm letting you go.

975
01:53:10,326 --> 01:53:11,327
皮塔…
Peeta...

976
01:53:11,410 --> 01:53:12,620
求你了
Please.

977
01:53:13,537 --> 01:53:14,622
留下吧
Stay.

978
01:53:19,752 --> 01:53:20,878
好吧
Okay.

979
01:53:22,338 --> 01:53:23,672
我不走
I'll stay.

980
01:54:52,761 --> 01:54:54,096
哦，天吶！
Oh, God!

981
01:55:25,461 --> 01:55:27,129
你的男朋友呢？
Where's lover boy?

982
01:55:29,798 --> 01:55:33,635
我知道了，你是為他而來的，對不對？
I see. You were gonna help him, right?

983
01:55:34,303 --> 01:55:38,891
太感人了。你知道嗎，救不了你那位小朋友
是多麼糟糕的一件事
Well, that's sweet. You know, it's too bad
that you couldn't help your little friend.

984
01:55:39,475 --> 01:55:41,810
她叫什麼來著？
That little girl? What was her name again?

985
01:55:42,686 --> 01:55:43,771
茹？
Rue?

986
01:55:46,398 --> 01:55:48,442
就是她，是我們殺了她
Yeah, well, we killed her.

987
01:55:49,151 --> 01:55:52,196
現在我來幹掉你
And now we're gonna kill you.

988
01:55:58,160 --> 01:55:59,453
你殺了她？
You kill her?

989
01:55:59,536 --> 01:56:00,746
- 不！
- 我聽見你說的了！
- No!
- I heard you!

990
01:56:00,829 --> 01:56:02,748
- 卡托！卡托！
- 你說了她的名字！
- Cato! Cato!
- You said her name!

991
01:56:02,831 --> 01:56:04,083
是你說的！
You said her name!

992
01:56:14,843 --> 01:56:16,011
就這一次
Just this time, 12.

993
01:56:17,179 --> 01:56:18,222
為了茹
For Rue.

994
01:56:34,530 --> 01:56:37,866
皮塔，我找到藥了
Peeta, I got it. I got the medicine.

995
01:56:38,158 --> 01:56:39,618
- 你怎麼了
- 沒怎麼
- What happened to you?
- I'm fine.

996
01:56:39,701 --> 01:56:41,120
不，你受傷了，發生什麼了？
No, you're not. What happened?

997
01:56:41,328 --> 01:56:43,622
2區的女孩，對我丟了一把飛刀，沒事的
The girl from 2, she threw a knife. I'm okay.

998
01:56:43,705 --> 01:56:45,457
你就不應該去
你說過你不會去的
You shouldn't have gone.
You said you weren't gonna go.

999
01:56:45,541 --> 01:56:47,042
你的傷好像更糟了
You got worse.

1000
01:56:51,213 --> 01:56:52,214
對不起
I'm sorry.

1001
01:56:53,757 --> 01:56:55,300
你也需要抹一點
You need some of that, too.

1002
01:56:55,634 --> 01:56:56,885
我沒事
I'm okay.

1003
01:56:59,888 --> 01:57:01,557
感覺好多了
That feels better.

1004
01:57:03,183 --> 01:57:05,310
好的，該你了
Okay. Now you.

1005
01:57:05,602 --> 01:57:08,230
- 我不用
- 來吧，你也抹點吧
- I'm okay.
- No, come on, you need it, too.

1006
01:57:08,313 --> 01:57:09,690
來
Come on.

1007
01:57:09,773 --> 01:57:11,066
好吧
All right.

1008
01:58:10,584 --> 01:58:11,585
嗨
Hi.

1009
01:58:14,713 --> 01:58:16,215
你痊癒得這麼快
You're so much better.

1010
01:58:18,508 --> 01:58:19,843
哦，天吶！皮塔
Oh, my God, Peeta.

1011
01:58:20,969 --> 01:58:22,763
我感覺好像沒受過傷一樣
I hardly feel anything.

1012
01:58:23,972 --> 01:58:25,682
我們能回家了
We could go home.

1013
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:29,102
是的，我們是這組裏僅存的兩個人
We could. We're the only team left.

1014
01:58:29,728 --> 01:58:31,355
我們要回家了
We could go home.

1015
01:58:36,151 --> 01:58:37,819
我們現在得知斯瑞斯離開了
（註：斯瑞斯，11區男性參賽者，
他能活著的唯一依靠就是一身蠻力）
We know Thresh took off.

1016
01:58:37,903 --> 01:58:39,696
卡托會去豐饒角那
Cato's gonna be by the Cornucopia.

1017
01:58:39,780 --> 01:58:41,823
他不會到自己沒去過的地方
He's not gonna go someplace
he doesn't know.

1018
01:58:41,907 --> 01:58:45,000
福克斯費斯不一定在哪呢
（註：福克斯費斯，5區女性參賽者，
靠頭腦作戰，擅長軍事佈局與策略）
Foxface, she could be anywhere.

1019
01:58:47,037 --> 01:58:50,249
咱們應該在這附近打獵
帶的食物都吃光了
We should probably hunt around here.
We don't have any food left.

1020
01:58:50,332 --> 01:58:51,959
好吧，我來射箭吧
Okay, I'll take the bow.

1021
01:58:54,002 --> 01:58:56,505
開玩笑罷了，我去採點果子
I'm just kidding. I'll go pick some stuff.

1022
01:59:14,731 --> 01:59:15,899
皮塔？
Peeta?

1023
01:59:20,445 --> 01:59:21,571
皮塔？
Peeta?

1024
01:59:24,658 --> 01:59:25,826
皮塔！
Peeta!

1025
01:59:27,035 --> 01:59:28,078
皮塔！
Peeta!

1026
01:59:28,161 --> 01:59:29,288
你沒事吧？
Are you okay?

1027
01:59:29,371 --> 01:59:31,164
- 我聽到加農炮的聲音了，我以為…
- 不
- I heard the cannon. I thought...
- No.

1028
01:59:31,248 --> 01:59:34,459
那是毒漿果，皮塔！吃它會要了你的命！
That's Nightlock, Peeta!
You'd be dead in a minute!

1029
01:59:34,543 --> 01:59:35,669
我不知道
I didn't know.

1030
01:59:35,752 --> 01:59:38,088
該死的，你差點嚇死我了
You scared me to death. Damn you.

1031
01:59:38,922 --> 01:59:40,257
對不起
I'm sorry.

1032
01:59:41,675 --> 01:59:43,051
對不起
I'm sorry.

1033
01:59:51,143 --> 01:59:53,312
我還不知道她在一直跟蹤我
I never even knew she was following me.

1034
01:59:53,395 --> 01:59:54,896
她真聰明
She's clever.

1035
01:59:55,147 --> 01:59:56,523
聰明極了
Too clever.

1036
01:59:57,858 --> 02:00:01,028
- 你在幹什麼？
- 也許卡托會喜歡這些漿果
- What are you doing?
- Maybe Cato likes berries, too.

1037
02:00:07,117 --> 02:00:08,618
現在幾點了？
What time is it?

1038
02:00:08,702 --> 02:00:10,120
剛到下午
A little after noon.

1039
02:00:10,203 --> 02:00:11,288
為什麼天色這麼黑？
Why is it getting so dark?

1040
02:00:11,413 --> 02:00:13,040
看來要盡早結束這場爭鬥了
Must be in a hurry to end it.

1041
02:00:16,460 --> 02:00:19,004
- 準備好了嗎， 露西婭？
- 在這，先生
- You ready, Lucia?
- Right here, sir.

1042
02:00:20,380 --> 02:00:22,090
很好，太棒了
Well, that's great.

1043
02:00:22,591 --> 02:00:23,967
- 可以把它放到競技場嗎？
- 沒問題
- Now can you put that in the middle?
- Sure.

1044
02:00:33,143 --> 02:00:36,688
就是這樣，效果一定不錯
That's it. That's excellent.

1045
02:00:48,408 --> 02:00:50,077
你聽見了嗎？
Did you hear that?

1046
02:01:22,401 --> 02:01:23,652
那是什麼聲音？
What was that?

1047
02:01:24,778 --> 02:01:26,446
慘叫
It's the finale.

1048
02:01:41,837 --> 02:01:42,838
我們走吧
Let's go.

1049
02:02:51,907 --> 02:02:52,908
快跑
Go.

1050
02:03:10,133 --> 02:03:11,134
凱特尼斯！
Katniss!

1051
02:03:36,660 --> 02:03:37,911
上去！
Here!

1052
02:04:50,734 --> 02:04:53,194
來啊，射我啊
Go on. Shoot.

1053
02:04:55,655 --> 02:04:57,866
我們倆都掉下去，你就贏了
Then we both go down and you'd win.

1054
02:05:01,202 --> 02:05:05,624
來吧，反正我死定了
Go on. I'm dead anyway.

1055
02:05:10,629 --> 02:05:12,380
一向如此，對嗎？
I always was, right?

1056
02:05:14,799 --> 02:05:16,843
直到現在我才知道
I didn't know that till now.

1057
02:05:20,180 --> 02:05:22,057
怎麼會這樣呢？這就是他們想要的嗎？
How is that? Is that what they want?

1058
02:05:24,643 --> 02:05:26,645
- 不
- 不，不要
- No.
- No, no.

1059
02:05:28,355 --> 02:05:29,731
我也可以把他的脖子扭斷的
I could still do this.

1060
02:05:31,232 --> 02:05:33,109
我會的
I could still do this.

1061
02:05:34,069 --> 02:05:35,945
再殺一個又能怎樣
One more kill.

1062
02:05:38,198 --> 02:05:40,742
這使我唯一知道怎麼做的事
It's the only thing I know how to do.

1063
02:05:41,076 --> 02:05:43,286
為我所在地的區域帶來榮耀
Bring pride to my district.

1064
02:05:46,956 --> 02:05:48,750
這並不重要
Not that it matters.

1065
02:06:05,266 --> 02:06:06,434
求你了！
Please!

1066
02:06:08,186 --> 02:06:09,187
不！
No!

1067
02:06:15,944 --> 02:06:16,945
求你殺了我吧！
Please!

1068
02:07:04,492 --> 02:07:06,995
貢品請注意，貢品請注意
<i>Attention. Attention, Tributes.</i>

1069
02:07:07,162 --> 02:07:10,582
規則稍有變化
<i>There has been a slight rule change.</i>

1070
02:07:10,707 --> 02:07:12,584
之前允許同一區域的兩人
<i>The previous revision,</i>

1071
02:07:12,667 --> 02:07:15,920
可作為勝者的規則
<i>allowing for two victors
from the same district,</i>

1072
02:07:16,004 --> 02:07:18,047
已被廢除
<i>has been revoked.</i>

1073
02:07:19,215 --> 02:07:23,344
新規則規定只允許有一名勝者，祝你們好運
<i>Only one victor may be crowned. Good luck.</i>

1074
02:07:24,512 --> 02:07:27,515
希望好運永遠站在你這邊
<i>And may the odds be ever in your favor.</i>

1075
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:43,531
來吧
Go ahead.

1076
02:07:47,619 --> 02:07:49,496
只有一個人能回家
One of us should go home.

1077
02:07:50,330 --> 02:07:53,708
必須要有人作出犧牲，他們只要一個勝者
One of us has to die.
They have to have their victor.

1078
02:07:54,292 --> 02:07:55,376
不
No.

1079
02:07:56,586 --> 02:07:58,004
他們不能這樣
They don't.

1080
02:07:59,839 --> 02:08:01,049
為什麼總任由他們擺佈？
Why should they?

1081
02:08:02,175 --> 02:08:03,885
- 不！
- 相信我
- No!
- Trust me.

1082
02:08:04,886 --> 02:08:06,137
相信我
Trust me.

1083
02:08:25,031 --> 02:08:26,449
一起來？
Together?

1084
02:08:27,992 --> 02:08:29,244
一起
Together.

1085
02:08:30,495 --> 02:08:31,579
好的
Okay.

1086
02:08:32,664 --> 02:08:33,832
1
One...


1087
02:08:36,084 --> 02:08:37,335
2
Two...


1088
02:08:43,424 --> 02:08:44,634
3
Three.

1089
02:08:46,302 --> 02:08:47,554
住手！
<i>Stop!</i>

1090
02:08:48,346 --> 02:08:49,597
住手！
<i>Stop!</i>

1091
02:08:53,059 --> 02:08:56,604
女士們，先生們，我來介紹一下
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
may I present the winners</i>

1092
02:08:57,480 --> 02:09:00,275
第74屆年度飢餓遊戲的勝者
<i>of the 74th Annual Hunger Games.</i>

1093
02:09:27,385 --> 02:09:29,304
他們對你並不滿意
<i>They're not happy with you.</i>

1094
02:09:29,971 --> 02:09:32,015
為什麼？因為我沒死嗎？
Why? Because I didn't die?

1095
02:09:32,473 --> 02:09:34,267
因為你讓他們出醜了
Because you showed them up.

1096
02:09:35,143 --> 02:09:37,937
好吧，對不起，我沒按規則辦事
Well, I'm sorry
it didn't go the way they planned.

1097
02:09:38,021 --> 02:09:40,231
- 我對他們也不滿意
- 凱特尼斯！
- I'm not very happy with them either.
- Katniss!

1098
02:09:40,857 --> 02:09:43,985
嚴肅一點，這不只是為了你自己
This is serious. Notjust for you.

1099
02:09:44,402 --> 02:09:46,529
他們不會就這麼輕易罷手的
They don't take these things lightly.

1100
02:10:38,414 --> 02:10:40,750
當他們問你的時候，你就說控制不住自己
When they ask,
you say you couldn't help yourself.

1101
02:10:40,833 --> 02:10:43,211
你和這個男孩很恩愛
You were so in love with this boy

1102
02:10:43,294 --> 02:10:47,382
不敢想像沒有他會是什麼樣子
that the thought of not being with him
was unthinkable.

1103
02:10:47,548 --> 02:10:51,761
如果失去他不如讓我去死，明白嗎？
You'd rather die than not be with him.
You understand?

1104
02:10:52,261 --> 02:10:56,724
當你在河邊找到他的時候是什麼感覺？
How did you feel
when you found him by that river?

1105
02:11:01,396 --> 02:11:03,648
感覺我是全世界最幸福的人
I felt like the happiest person in the world.

1106
02:11:07,777 --> 02:11:10,321
不敢想像沒有他生活會變成什麼樣子
I couldn't imagine life without him.

1107
02:11:16,995 --> 02:11:18,621
你呢，皮塔？
And what about you, Peeta?

1108
02:11:19,747 --> 02:11:21,457
他救了我一命
She saved my life.

1109
02:11:21,541 --> 02:11:22,583
我們拯救了彼此
We saved each other.

1110
02:11:24,335 --> 02:11:28,840
女士們，先生們，第74屆年度飢餓遊戲總冠軍是
Ladies and gentlemen,
the star-crossed lovers from District 12,

1111
02:11:28,923 --> 02:11:34,595
來自第12區的倒霉情侶！
this year's victors
of the 74th Annual Hunger Games!

1112
02:11:51,195 --> 02:11:52,697
恭喜你們
Congratulations.

1113
02:11:52,780 --> 02:11:54,115
謝謝
Thank you.

1114
02:11:59,954 --> 02:12:01,372
胸針很漂亮
What a lovely pin.

1115
02:12:01,456 --> 02:12:03,833
謝謝，這是我們區域的饋贈
Thank you. It's from my district.

1116
02:12:04,584 --> 02:12:06,878
他們一定會為你感到非常驕傲的
They must be very proud of you.

1117
02:12:19,682 --> 02:12:22,101
回去了我們會怎麼樣？
So what happens when we get back?

1118
02:12:23,478 --> 02:12:27,398
不知道，我想我們應該試著忘記這段經歷
I don't know. I guess we try to forget.

1119
02:12:32,278 --> 02:12:34,155
我不想忘掉
I don't want to forget.

1120
02:13:25,582 --> 02:13:28,261
