<i>- I'm giving you a choice:</i>

3
00:01:08,185 --> 00:01:11,594
<i>- Either put on these glasses
or start eating that trashcan.</i>

4
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:16,112
I already am eating from
the trashcan all the time.

5
00:01:16,287 --> 00:01:19,477
The name of this trashcan
is ideology.

6
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:23,608
The material force
of ideology -

7
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:29,120
makes me not see
what I'm effectively eating.

8
00:01:29,295 --> 00:01:33,022
It's not only our reality
which enslaves us.

9
00:01:33,197 --> 00:01:35,924
The tragedy of
our predicament -

10
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:38,928
when we are within
ideology, is that -

11
00:01:39,103 --> 00:01:42,818
when we think that we
escape it into our dreams -

12
00:01:42,993 --> 00:01:46,543
at that point we
are within ideology.

13
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:29,721
'They Live' from 1988
is definitely one of the -

14
00:02:29,896 --> 00:02:34,111
forgotten masterpieces
of the Hollywood left.

15
00:02:36,806 --> 00:02:39,960
It tells the story of
John Nada.

16
00:02:40,135 --> 00:02:43,139
'Nada' of course is Spanish
means 'nothing'.

17
00:02:43,314 --> 00:02:48,101
A pure subject, deprived
of all substantial content.

18
00:02:48,276 --> 00:02:52,764
A homeless worker in L.A.
who, drifting around -

19
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,943
one day enters into
an abandoned church -

20
00:02:56,118 --> 00:03:01,565
and finds there a strange
box full of sunglasses.

21
00:03:05,307 --> 00:03:10,102
And when he put one of them on
walking along the L.A. streets -

22
00:03:10,277 --> 00:03:13,015
he discovers
something weird;

23
00:03:14,183 --> 00:03:20,520
That these glasses function like
critique-of-ideology glasses.

24
00:03:25,953 --> 00:03:31,165
They allow you to see
the real message beneath -

25
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:36,328
all the propaganda, publicity
glitz, posters and so on.

26
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:43,252
You see a large publicity
board telling you -

27
00:03:43,427 --> 00:03:45,500
have your holiday
of a lifetime -

28
00:03:45,675 --> 00:03:47,260
and when you
put the glasses on -

29
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:52,492
you just see just on the white
background a gray inscription.

30
00:03:54,273 --> 00:03:58,573
We live, so we are told,
in a post-ideological society.

31
00:03:58,748 --> 00:04:01,701
We are interpolated,
that is to say -

32
00:04:01,876 --> 00:04:04,404
addressed by
social authority -

33
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:09,589
not as subjects who should
do their duty, sacrifice themselves -

34
00:04:09,764 --> 00:04:12,410
but subjects of pleasures.

35
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,583
Realise your true potential.

36
00:04:15,758 --> 00:04:17,631
Be yourself.

37
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,812
Lead a satisfying life.

38
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:28,865
When you put the
glasses on -

39
00:04:30,376 --> 00:04:33,551
you see dictatorship
in democracy.

40
00:04:33,726 --> 00:04:40,017
It's the invisible order which
sustains your apparent freedom.

41
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:44,841
The explanation for the existence
of these strange ideology glasses -

42
00:04:45,016 --> 00:04:49,872
is the standard story of the
'Invasion of the Body Snatchers'.

43
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:57,187
Humanity is already under
the control of aliens.

44
00:04:57,362 --> 00:04:59,398
<i>- Hey buddy!</i>

45
00:04:59,573 --> 00:05:01,685
<i>You gonna pay for that or what?</i>

46
00:05:06,452 --> 00:05:09,247
<i>- Look buddy, I don't want
no hassle today.</i>

47
00:05:09,422 --> 00:05:11,822
<i>- Either pay for it
or put it back.</i>

48
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,137
According to our common sense -

49
00:05:17,312 --> 00:05:22,224
we think that ideology is
something blurring, confusing -

50
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,592
our straight view.

51
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:30,301
Ideology should be glasses
which distort our view -

52
00:05:30,476 --> 00:05:35,793
and the critique of ideology
should be the opposite -

53
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:40,539
like, you take off the glasses
so that you can finally see -

54
00:05:40,714 --> 00:05:43,266
the way things really are.

55
00:05:43,441 --> 00:05:46,386
This precisely, and here
the pessimism of -

56
00:05:46,561 --> 00:05:48,188
the film, of 'They Live' -

57
00:05:48,363 --> 00:05:52,458
is well justified, this precisely
is the ultimate illusion:

58
00:05:52,633 --> 00:05:56,807
Ideology is not simply
imposed on ourselves

59
00:05:56,982 --> 00:06:03,707
Ideology is our spontaneous
relationship to our social world -

60
00:06:03,882 --> 00:06:06,906
how we perceive each meaning
and so on and so on.

61
00:06:07,081 --> 00:06:11,285
We in a way
enjoy our ideology.

62
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,383
<i>- Alright.</i>

63
00:06:12,558 --> 00:06:15,512
To step out of ideology -

64
00:06:15,687 --> 00:06:18,295
it hurts.
It's a painful experience.

65
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,764
you must force yourself to do it.

66
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:24,970
This is rendered in a
wonderful way with -

67
00:06:25,145 --> 00:06:26,885
a further scene in the film -

68
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:33,472
where John Nada tries to force
his best friend, John Armitage -

69
00:06:33,647 --> 00:06:36,287
to also put the glasses on.

70
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:38,414
<i>- I don't want to fight you.
- Come on!</i>

71
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:39,779
<i>- I don't want to fight you.
- Come on!</i>

72
00:06:39,954 --> 00:06:41,194
<i>- Stop it!
- No!</i>

73
00:06:41,369 --> 00:06:44,112
And it's the weirdest
scene in the film.

74
00:06:44,287 --> 00:06:45,890
The fight takes eight,
nine minutes.

75
00:06:46,065 --> 00:06:47,573
<i>- Put on the glasses!</i>

76
00:06:47,748 --> 00:06:51,795
It may appear irrational
because why does this guy -

77
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,559
reject so violently to
put the glasses on?

78
00:06:54,734 --> 00:06:59,931
It is as if he is well aware
that spontaneously he lives -

79
00:07:00,106 --> 00:07:04,547
in a lie. That the glasses
will make him see the truth -

80
00:07:04,722 --> 00:07:07,296
but that this truth
can be painful.

81
00:07:07,471 --> 00:07:12,136
Can shatter many
of your illusions.

82
00:07:14,085 --> 00:07:16,560
This is a paradox
we have to accept.

83
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:20,203
<i>- Put the glasses on!
Put 'em on!</i>

84
00:07:20,378 --> 00:07:24,405
The extreme violence
of liberation.

85
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,429
You must be forced
to be free.

86
00:07:27,604 --> 00:07:30,991
If you trust simply your
spontaneous sense of -

87
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,173
well-being or whatever -

88
00:07:32,348 --> 00:07:33,755
you will never get free.

89
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:34,984
<i>- Look!</i>

90
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:37,490
Freedom hurts.

91
00:07:41,282 --> 00:07:44,688
The basic insight
of psychoanalysis -

92
00:07:44,863 --> 00:07:51,535
is to distinguish between
enjoyment and simple pleasures.

93
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,682
They are not the same.

94
00:07:55,604 --> 00:08:00,666
Enjoyment is precisely enjoyment
in disturbed pleasure -

95
00:08:00,841 --> 00:08:03,729
even enjoyment in pain.

96
00:08:03,904 --> 00:08:08,991
And this excessive factor
disturbs the apparently simple -

97
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:14,928
relationship between
duty and pleasures.

98
00:08:16,823 --> 00:08:22,176
This is also a space
where ideology up to -

99
00:08:22,176 --> 00:08:26,429
and especially religious
ideology, operates.

100
00:08:29,181 --> 00:08:32,916
This brings me to maybe
my favourite example -

101
00:08:33,091 --> 00:08:37,501
the great classical Hollywood film
'The Sound of Music'.

102
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:44,399
We all know it's the story
of a nun who is too alive -

103
00:08:44,574 --> 00:08:46,648
with too much energy -

104
00:08:46,823 --> 00:08:49,048
ultimately sexual energy,

105
00:08:49,223 --> 00:08:52,861
to be constrained
to the role of a nun.

106
00:08:53,036 --> 00:08:55,604
<i>- Oh, Reverend Mother.
I'm so sorry. I just couldn't -</i>

107
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:57,633
<i>help myself. The gates
we're open and</i>

108
00:08:57,808 --> 00:08:59,070
<i>the hills were beckoning</i>
<i>and before I...</i>

109
00:08:59,245 --> 00:09:01,706
<i>- Maria, I haven't summoned
you here for apologies.</i>

110
00:09:01,881 --> 00:09:04,072
<i>- Oh, please mother do let me
ask for forgiveness.</i>

111
00:09:04,247 --> 00:09:06,809
<i>- One, two three.
One, two, three.</i>

112
00:09:06,984 --> 00:09:09,478
<i>- One, two, three.
Step together. Now...</i>

113
00:09:09,653 --> 00:09:14,003
So, Mother Superior sends her
to the Von Trapp family -

114
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:16,821
where she takes care
of the children -

115
00:09:16,996 --> 00:09:18,860
<i>- Under.</i>

116
00:09:19,035 --> 00:09:23,102
<i>- Kurt, we'll have to practice...
- Do allow me will you?</i>

117
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,583
and at the same time,
of course, falls in love -

118
00:09:27,758 --> 00:09:30,408
with the baron Von Trapp.

119
00:09:35,657 --> 00:09:37,875
And Maria gets too
disturbed by it -

120
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:42,086
cannot control it,
returns to the convent -

121
00:09:42,261 --> 00:09:43,801
<i>- Oh there were times when
we would look at each other...</i>

122
00:09:43,976 --> 00:09:46,035
<i>- Oh, Mother,
I could hardly breathe.</i>

123
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,506
<i>- Did you let him
see how you felt?</i>

124
00:09:47,681 --> 00:09:49,866
<i>- If I did I didn't know it.
That's what's been -</i>

125
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,379
<i>torturing me, I was there
on God's errand.</i>

126
00:09:52,554 --> 00:09:56,189
No wonder that in old
communist Yugoslavia -

127
00:09:56,364 --> 00:10:00,090
where I saw this film
for the first time -

128
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:04,223
exactly this scene,
or more precisely -

129
00:10:04,398 --> 00:10:08,387
the song which follows this
strange hedonist, if you want, -

130
00:10:08,648 --> 00:10:10,762
advice from the mother superior:

131
00:10:10,937 --> 00:10:13,850
"Go back, seduce the guy,
follow this path" -

132
00:10:14,025 --> 00:10:16,618
"do not betray your desire..."

133
00:10:16,793 --> 00:10:21,619
Namely the song which begins
with "Climb every mountain";

134
00:10:21,794 --> 00:10:25,537
The song which is an
almost embarrassing display -

135
00:10:25,712 --> 00:10:27,741
and affirmation of desire.

136
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:31,162
This three minutes were censored.

137
00:10:31,337 --> 00:10:35,557
<i>- Climb every mountain.</i>

138
00:10:35,732 --> 00:10:39,853
<i>- Search high and low.</i>

139
00:10:40,028 --> 00:10:44,303
<i>- Follow every by-way</i>

140
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:48,101
<i>- Every path you know.</i>

141
00:10:48,276 --> 00:10:52,357
I think the sensor was
a very intelligent man.

142
00:10:52,532 --> 00:10:55,641
He knew, as probably
an atheist communist, -

143
00:10:55,816 --> 00:11:01,298
where the power of attraction
of catholic religion resides.

144
00:11:02,148 --> 00:11:06,017
<i>- 'Till you find your dream.</i>

145
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:11,388
If you read intelligent
catholic propagandists -

146
00:11:11,563 --> 00:11:16,747
and if you really try to discern
what deal are they offering you?

147
00:11:16,922 --> 00:11:21,604
It's not to prohibit,
in this case sexual pleasures.

148
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:25,454
It's a much more cynical
contract, as it were, -

149
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:29,904
between the church as
an institution and the believer -

150
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,951
troubled with, in this case,
sexual desires.

151
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:38,489
It is this hidden obscene
permission that you get -

152
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:41,139
You are covered by
the divine 'Big Other' -

153
00:11:41,314 --> 00:11:43,322
you can do
what ever you want.

154
00:11:43,497 --> 00:11:45,380
Enjoy.

155
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:50,395
<i>- A dream that will need...</i>

156
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:53,145
This obscene contract
does not belong -

157
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,695
to Christianity as such.

158
00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:02,035
It belongs to catholic church
as an institution.

159
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:06,797
It is the logic of institution
at its purest.

160
00:12:06,972 --> 00:12:10,820
<i>- Climb every mountain.</i>

161
00:12:10,995 --> 00:12:18,365
This is again a key
to the functioning of ideology.

162
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:23,160
Not only the explicit message:
renounce, suffer and so on -

163
00:12:23,335 --> 00:12:26,547
but the true hidden message:

164
00:12:26,722 --> 00:12:31,016
Pretend to renounce and
you can get it all.

165
00:12:34,466 --> 00:12:39,347
My psychoanalytic friends are
telling me that typically today -

166
00:12:39,522 --> 00:12:44,367
patients who come to the analyst
to resolve their problems -

167
00:12:44,542 --> 00:12:49,243
feel guilty, not because of
excessive pleasures -

168
00:12:49,418 --> 00:12:53,493
not because they indulge in
pleasures which go against -

169
00:12:53,668 --> 00:12:57,443
their sense of duty or
morality, or what-so-ever.

170
00:12:57,618 --> 00:13:02,693
On the contrary, they feel
guilty for not enjoying enough.

171
00:13:02,868 --> 00:13:06,113
For not being able to enjoy.

172
00:13:40,976 --> 00:13:44,803
Oh my god, one is thirsty
in the desert and -

173
00:13:44,978 --> 00:13:48,555
what to drink but Coke?

174
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,200
The perfect commodity.
Why?

175
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:54,595
It was already Marx who
long ago emphasized that -

176
00:13:54,770 --> 00:14:00,274
a commodity is never just a simple
object that we buy and consume.

177
00:14:01,033 --> 00:14:06,041
A commodity is an object
full of theological -

178
00:14:06,216 --> 00:14:09,126
even metaphysical niceties.

179
00:14:09,301 --> 00:14:14,876
Its presence always reflects
an invisible transcendence.

180
00:14:15,051 --> 00:14:22,826
And the classical publicity for Coke
quite openly refers to this -

181
00:14:23,001 --> 00:14:25,576
absent, invisible quality.

182
00:14:25,751 --> 00:14:29,826
Coke is 'The Real Thing' or
'Coke - That's it'.

183
00:14:30,001 --> 00:14:32,264
What is that 'it', the 'real thing'?

184
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:37,514
It's not just another positive
property of Coke -

185
00:14:37,689 --> 00:14:41,191
something that can be
described or pinpointed -

186
00:14:41,366 --> 00:14:42,764
through chemical analysis -

187
00:14:42,939 --> 00:14:46,710
it's that mysterious
'something more'.

188
00:14:47,356 --> 00:14:52,708
The indescribable excess
which is the Object-Cause -

189
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,997
of my Desire.

190
00:14:56,436 --> 00:15:00,575
In our post-modern,
how ever we call them, societies -

191
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,464
we are obliged to enjoy.

192
00:15:05,085 --> 00:15:09,928
Enjoyment becomes a kind or
a weird perverted duty.

193
00:15:11,764 --> 00:15:14,780
The paradox of Coke is that
you are thirsty -

194
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,455
you drink it but,
as everyone knows -

195
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,959
the more you drink it
the more thirsty you get.

196
00:15:21,134 --> 00:15:28,171
A desire is never simply
the desire for certain thing.

197
00:15:28,346 --> 00:15:31,839
It's always also a desire
for desire itself.

198
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:36,404
A desire to continue to desire.

199
00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:40,988
Perhaps the ultimate
horror of a desire is -

200
00:15:41,163 --> 00:15:43,891
to be fully filled-in, met -

201
00:15:44,066 --> 00:15:46,988
so that I desire no longer.

202
00:15:47,163 --> 00:15:51,485
The ultimate melancholic
experience is the experience -

203
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:56,101
of a loss of desire itself.

204
00:15:56,276 --> 00:16:01,642
It's not that in some return
to a previous era -

205
00:16:01,817 --> 00:16:04,871
of natural consummation -

206
00:16:05,046 --> 00:16:09,310
where we got rid of this excess
and were only consuming -

207
00:16:09,485 --> 00:16:10,831
for actual needs -

208
00:16:11,006 --> 00:16:13,945
like you were thirsty,
you drank water, and so on.

209
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,543
We cannot return to that.

210
00:16:15,718 --> 00:16:18,365
The excess is with us forever.

211
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,864
So, let's have a drink of Coke.

212
00:16:24,222 --> 00:16:25,921
It's getting warm.

213
00:16:26,071 --> 00:16:29,406
It's no longer 'The Real Coke'
and that's the problem.

214
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:35,900
You know, this passage from
sublime to excremental dimension.

215
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:40,770
When it's cold, properly served,
it has a certain attraction -

216
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,814
all of a sudden
this can change into shit.

217
00:16:43,964 --> 00:16:48,088
It's the elementary dialectics
of commodities.

218
00:16:48,338 --> 00:16:52,029
We are not talking about
objective, factual properties -

219
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:58,013
of a commodity. We are talking
only here about that elusive surplus.

220
00:17:05,978 --> 00:17:08,225
'Kinder Surprise egg'.

221
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,929
A quite astonishing commodity.

222
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:16,169
The surprise of the 'Kinder
Surprise egg' is that -

223
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:21,148
this excessive object,
the cause of your desire -

224
00:17:21,298 --> 00:17:25,772
is here materialized.
In the guise of an object -

225
00:17:25,922 --> 00:17:30,692
a plastic toy which fills in
the inner void -

226
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:32,598
of the chocolate egg.

227
00:17:32,748 --> 00:17:37,758
The whole delicate balance
is between these two dimensions:

228
00:17:37,908 --> 00:17:42,008
What you bought, the chocolate
egg, and the surplus -

229
00:17:42,158 --> 00:17:44,893
probably made in some Chinese
gulag or whatever -

230
00:17:44,943 --> 00:17:47,486
the surplus that
you get for free.

231
00:17:47,636 --> 00:17:54,733
I don't think that the chocolate
frame is here just to send you -

232
00:17:54,883 --> 00:17:58,828
on a deeper voyage towards
the inner treasure -

233
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:04,888
the, what Plato calls the 'Agalma'
which makes you a worthy person, -

234
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:08,544
which makes a commodity
the desirable commodity -

235
00:18:08,694 --> 00:18:11,494
I think it's the other around.

236
00:18:11,544 --> 00:18:17,546
We should aim at the higher goal,
the gold in the middle of an object -

237
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:22,174
precisely in order to
be able to enjoy the surface.

238
00:18:22,324 --> 00:18:26,377
This is what is the
anti-metaphysical lesson, -

239
00:18:26,552 --> 00:18:30,279
which is difficult to accept.

240
00:18:49,524 --> 00:18:54,440
What does this famous
'Ode to Joy' stand for?

241
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:58,021
It's usually perceived as
a kind of ode to humanity -

242
00:18:58,171 --> 00:19:03,890
as such to the brotherhood
and freedom of all people.

243
00:19:03,966 --> 00:19:08,730
And what strikes the eye here
is the universal adaptability -

244
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,912
of this well-known melody.

245
00:19:18,062 --> 00:19:20,613
It can be used
by political movements -

246
00:19:20,763 --> 00:19:24,106
which are totally opposed
to each other.

247
00:19:24,356 --> 00:19:31,944
In Nazi Germany it was widely used
to celebrate great public events.

248
00:19:32,294 --> 00:19:35,525
In Soviet Union
Beethoven was lionized -

249
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:39,109
and the 'Ode to Joy' was
performed almost as -

250
00:19:39,284 --> 00:19:42,647
a kind of a communist song.

251
00:19:44,556 --> 00:19:49,265
In China during the time
of the great Cultural Revolution -

252
00:19:49,415 --> 00:19:52,620
when almost all western
music was prohibited -

253
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:55,328
the 9th symphony
was accepted.

254
00:19:55,478 --> 00:20:00,597
It was allowed to play it as a piece
of progressive bourgeois music.

255
00:20:08,058 --> 00:20:11,781
At the extreme right
in South Rhodesia -

256
00:20:11,956 --> 00:20:13,484
before it became Zimbabwe -

257
00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:15,466
it proclaimed independence
to be able -

258
00:20:15,641 --> 00:20:19,546
to postpone the
abolishment of apartheid.

259
00:20:20,318 --> 00:20:22,377
Therefore those couple of
years of independence -

260
00:20:22,552 --> 00:20:26,019
South Rhodesia, again
the melody of 'Ode to Joy' -

261
00:20:26,194 --> 00:20:31,788
with changed lyrics of course,
was the anthem of the country.

262
00:20:40,378 --> 00:20:42,071
At the opposite end -

263
00:20:42,246 --> 00:20:45,849
when Abimael Guzman
President Gonzalo -

264
00:20:46,024 --> 00:20:50,573
the leader of 'Sendero Luminoso',
the 'Shining Path' -

265
00:20:50,748 --> 00:20:54,504
the extreme leftist
guerrilla in Peru.

266
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:57,968
When he was asked by
a journalist which piece of music -

267
00:20:58,143 --> 00:21:00,201
is his favourite,
he claimed -

268
00:21:00,376 --> 00:21:05,732
again Beethoven's 9th
symphony 'Ode to Joy'.

269
00:21:08,154 --> 00:21:10,235
When Germany was
still divided -

270
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:14,160
and their team was appearing
together at the Olympics -

271
00:21:14,918 --> 00:21:19,311
when one of the Germans
won golden medal -

272
00:21:20,187 --> 00:21:22,337
again Old to Joy
was played -

273
00:21:22,512 --> 00:21:26,647
instead of either East or
West German national anthem.

274
00:21:26,822 --> 00:21:31,327
And even now today
'Ode to Joy' is the unofficial -

275
00:21:31,502 --> 00:21:35,809
anthem of European union.

276
00:21:54,869 --> 00:22:00,803
So it's truly that we can imagine
a kind of a perverse scene of -

277
00:22:00,978 --> 00:22:04,359
universal fraternity
where Osama Bin Laden is -

278
00:22:04,534 --> 00:22:08,127
embracing President Bush,
Saddam is embracing -

279
00:22:08,302 --> 00:22:12,656
Fidel Castro, white races
is embracing Mao Tse Tung -

280
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,869
and all together they
sing 'Ode to Joy'.

281
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:22,363
It works. And this is how
every ideology has to work.

282
00:22:22,538 --> 00:22:24,588
It's never just meaning.

283
00:22:24,763 --> 00:22:29,851
It always has to also work
as an empty container -

284
00:22:30,026 --> 00:22:33,015
open to all
possible meanings.

285
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:36,947
It's, you know, that
gut feeling that we feel -

286
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,799
when we experience something
pathetic and we say:

287
00:22:39,974 --> 00:22:43,617
"Oh my God, I am so moved,
there is something so deep."

288
00:22:43,792 --> 00:22:45,864
But you never know
what this depth is.

289
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:48,310
It's a void.

290
00:22:48,485 --> 00:22:50,736
Now, of course
there is a catch here.

291
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:54,497
The catch is that of course
this neutrality of a frame -

292
00:22:54,672 --> 00:22:59,837
is never as neutral
as it appears.

293
00:23:03,637 --> 00:23:06,365
Here, I think the
perspective of Alex from -

294
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,947
the 'Clockwork Orange' enters.

295
00:23:09,122 --> 00:23:12,723
<i>- We were all feeling a bit
shagged and fagged and fashed.</i>

296
00:23:12,898 --> 00:23:16,215
<i>- It having been an evening of
some small energy expenditure -</i>

297
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,501
oh my brothers.

298
00:23:17,676 --> 00:23:20,495
<i>- So we got rid of the auto
and stopped off at The Korova -</i>

299
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,060
for a nightcap.

300
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:28,192
Why is Alex, this ultimate
cynical delinquent, the hero of -

301
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:32,031
'Clockwork Orange',
why is he so fascinated -

302
00:23:32,206 --> 00:23:33,248
overwhelmed -

303
00:23:33,423 --> 00:23:38,615
when he sees the lady
singing Beethoven's 'Ode to Joy'?

304
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:41,033
<i>- And it was like for a moment,
oh my brothers, -</i>

305
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:44,321
<i>some great bird had
flown into the milk bar -</i>

306
00:23:44,496 --> 00:23:47,824
<i>and I felt all the malanky
little hairs on my plott -</i>

307
00:23:47,999 --> 00:23:51,493
<i>standing endwise and
the shivers crawling up -</i>

308
00:23:51,668 --> 00:23:55,807
<i>like slow malanky lizards,
and then down again.</i>

309
00:23:55,982 --> 00:23:58,652
<i>- Because I knew
what she sang.</i>

310
00:23:58,827 --> 00:24:03,410
<i>- It was a bit from the glorious
ninth by Ludwig van.</i>

311
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:09,115
Whenever an ideological
text says: "all humanity" -

312
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:12,193
"unite in brotherhood,
joy" and so on, -

313
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:13,737
you should always ask:

314
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:16,571
"Ok, ok, ok, but are this all,
really all?" -

315
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:19,411
"or is someone excluded?"

316
00:24:19,586 --> 00:24:23,223
I think Alex the delinquent
from Clockwork Orange -

317
00:24:23,398 --> 00:24:27,473
identifies with this
place of exclusion.

318
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:32,649
And the great genius
of Beethoven is that -

319
00:24:32,824 --> 00:24:36,264
he literally states
this exclusion.

320
00:24:36,439 --> 00:24:40,114
All of a sudden the whole
tone changes into a kind of -

321
00:24:40,289 --> 00:24:42,828
a carnavalesque rythm.

322
00:24:43,003 --> 00:24:47,741
It's no longer this
sublime beauty.

323
00:24:49,665 --> 00:24:52,566
<i>- Excuse me brother,
I ordered this two weeks ago -</i>

324
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,582
<i>can you see if
it's arrived yet please?</i>

325
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,173
<i>- Just a minute.</i>

326
00:25:03,023 --> 00:25:07,583
We hear this vulgar music
precisely when Alex enters -

327
00:25:07,758 --> 00:25:11,457
a shopping arcade and
we can see from his movements -

328
00:25:11,632 --> 00:25:13,507
that now he feels at home.

329
00:25:13,682 --> 00:25:17,492
He is like fish in the water.

330
00:25:22,818 --> 00:25:23,801
<i>- Pardon me ladies.</i>

331
00:25:23,976 --> 00:25:25,851
Beethoven is not the
cheap celebrator -

332
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:28,101
of the brotherhood
of humanity and so on, -

333
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:31,028
we are one big happy family
enjoying freedom, -

334
00:25:31,203 --> 00:25:32,599
dignity, and so on.

335
00:25:32,774 --> 00:25:34,220
<i>-  Enjoying that are
you my darling?</i>

336
00:25:34,395 --> 00:25:37,264
The first part, which is falsely
celebrated today, -

337
00:25:37,439 --> 00:25:39,414
you hear it in
all official events -

338
00:25:39,589 --> 00:25:42,533
is clearly identified
with Beethoven -

339
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:46,815
as ideology, and then
the second part tells -

340
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:51,265
the true story of that which
disturbs the official ideology -

341
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,807
and of the failure
of the offical ideology -

342
00:25:54,982 --> 00:25:57,524
to constrain it,
to tame it.

343
00:25:57,699 --> 00:26:01,441
This is why Beethoven
was doing something -

344
00:26:01,616 --> 00:26:03,937
which may appear
difficult to do.

345
00:26:04,112 --> 00:26:07,607
He was already in
the purely musical work -

346
00:26:07,782 --> 00:26:10,976
practicing critique
of ideology.

347
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:18,580
If the classical ideology
functioned in the way -

348
00:26:18,755 --> 00:26:22,064
designated by Marx
in his nice formula -

349
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:23,614
from Capital Volume One:

350
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:25,714
<i>"Sie wissen es nicht,
aber sie tun es."</i>

351
00:26:25,889 --> 00:26:27,276
"They don't know
what they are doing" -

352
00:26:27,451 --> 00:26:29,659
"but they are
none the less doing it."

353
00:26:29,834 --> 00:26:34,274
Cynical ideology functions
in the mode of -

354
00:26:34,449 --> 00:26:36,928
"I know very well
what I am doing"

355
00:26:37,103 --> 00:26:39,997
"but I am still none
the less doing it."

356
00:26:43,928 --> 00:26:48,589
This paradoxical constellation
is staged in a beautiful way -

357
00:26:48,764 --> 00:26:53,504
in the famous song 'Officer Krupke'
in Bernstein's and Sondheim's -

358
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,101
'West Side Story'.

359
00:26:55,276 --> 00:26:56,891
<i>- Hey you!</i>

360
00:26:57,066 --> 00:26:59,311
<i>- Who me, officer Krupke?
- Yeah you!</i>

361
00:26:59,486 --> 00:27:00,811
<i>- Give me one good
reason for not -</i>

362
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:03,947
<i>dragging you down
to station house, you punk.</i>

363
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,477
<i>- Dear...</i>

364
00:27:05,652 --> 00:27:08,614
<i>kindly Sergeant Krupke,
you gotta understand -</i>

365
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:11,771
<i>it's just our bringin' up-ke,
that gets us out of hand.</i>

366
00:27:11,946 --> 00:27:15,064
<i>- Our mothers all are junkies,
our fathers all are drunks.</i>

367
00:27:15,239 --> 00:27:17,936
<i>- Golly Moses,
natcherly we're punks!</i>

368
00:27:18,111 --> 00:27:21,463
<i>-Gee, Officer Krupke,
we're very upset.</i>

369
00:27:21,638 --> 00:27:22,387
<i>- We never had the...</i>

370
00:27:22,562 --> 00:27:26,853
The delinquent gang enact
a whole explanation, -

371
00:27:27,028 --> 00:27:31,854
as a musical number of course,
of why they are delinquents.

372
00:27:32,029 --> 00:27:34,804
<i>- ...there is good,
there is untapped good!</i>

373
00:27:34,979 --> 00:27:36,382
<i>- Like inside,
the worst of us is good!</i>

374
00:27:36,557 --> 00:27:38,793
Addressing the police officer Krupke, -

375
00:27:38,968 --> 00:27:42,783
who is not there but all is
addressed at the police officer.

376
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:44,033
<i>- ...toucthin' good story.</i>

377
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:45,583
<i>- Lemme tell it to the world!</i>

378
00:27:45,758 --> 00:27:47,440
<i>- Just tell it to the judge.</i>

379
00:27:47,615 --> 00:27:50,760
So one of them adopts
the position of a judge:

380
00:27:54,186 --> 00:27:57,531
<i>- Dear kindly Judge, your Honor,
my parents treat me rough.</i>

381
00:27:57,706 --> 00:28:00,381
<i>- With all their marijuana,
they won't give me a puff.</i>

382
00:28:00,556 --> 00:28:02,719
Then the psychological
explanation:

383
00:28:02,894 --> 00:28:04,169
<i>- ...he shouldn't be here.</i>

384
00:28:04,344 --> 00:28:07,758
<i>- This boy don't need a couch,
He needs a useful career.</i>

385
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:10,909
<i>- Society's played him
a terrible trick -</i>

386
00:28:11,084 --> 00:28:12,659
<i>und sociologically
he's sick!</i>

387
00:28:12,834 --> 00:28:13,795
<i>- I am sick!</i>

388
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:14,815
<i>- We are sick, we are sick...</i>

389
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:20,684
The paradox here is how can
you know all this and still do it?

390
00:28:20,859 --> 00:28:24,724
This is the cynical
functioning of ideology.

391
00:28:24,899 --> 00:28:29,388
They're never what they appear
to be cynical brutal delinquents.

392
00:28:29,563 --> 00:28:32,645
They always have
a tiny private dream.

393
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,922
This dream can be many things.

394
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:41,435
It can even be something
quite ordinary.

395
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:47,052
Let's take the English riots
of august 2011.

396
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:50,493
The standard liberal explanation
really sounds like -

397
00:28:50,668 --> 00:28:53,893
a repetition of
'Officer Krupke' song.

398
00:28:54,068 --> 00:28:59,675
We cannot just condemn this
riot as delinquent vandalism.

399
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:03,529
You have to see how these people
live in practically ghettos -

400
00:29:03,704 --> 00:29:05,115
isolated communities -

401
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:08,315
no proper family life,
no proper education.

402
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:12,389
They don't even have a prospect
of a regular employment.

403
00:29:12,564 --> 00:29:17,168
But this is not enough
because man is not simply -

404
00:29:17,343 --> 00:29:21,234
a product of objective
circumstances.

405
00:29:22,834 --> 00:29:29,051
We all have this margin
of freedom in deciding -

406
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:34,824
how we subjectivise these
objective circumstances -

407
00:29:34,999 --> 00:29:37,491
which will of course
determine us.

408
00:29:37,666 --> 00:29:44,716
How we react to them by
constructing our own universe.

409
00:29:45,146 --> 00:29:49,046
The conservative solution
is we need more police.

410
00:29:49,221 --> 00:29:52,197
We need courts, which pass
severe judgements.

411
00:29:52,372 --> 00:29:55,816
I think this solution
is too simple.

412
00:29:56,701 --> 00:30:00,219
If I listen closely to some of
David Cameron's statements -

413
00:30:00,394 --> 00:30:03,248
it looked as if ok,
they are beating people, -

414
00:30:03,423 --> 00:30:06,612
burning houses, but the
truly horrible thing is -

415
00:30:06,787 --> 00:30:10,586
that they were taking objects
without paying for them.

416
00:30:10,761 --> 00:30:13,155
The ultimate things
that we can imagine.

417
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:16,035
In a very limited way,
Cameron was right -

418
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:19,637
there was no
ideological justification.

419
00:30:19,812 --> 00:30:24,937
It is the reaction of people
who are totally caught into -

420
00:30:25,112 --> 00:30:30,484
the predominant ideology
but have no ways to realise -

421
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:34,815
what this ideology demands
of them so it's kind of -

422
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:41,822
a wild acting out within this
ideological space of consumerism.

423
00:30:42,672 --> 00:30:45,360
Even if we are dealing
with apparently -

424
00:30:45,535 --> 00:30:48,424
totally non-ideological
brutality, -

425
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:52,793
I just want to burn houses,
to get objects.

426
00:30:52,968 --> 00:30:58,111
It is the result of a very specific
social and ideological -

427
00:30:58,286 --> 00:31:02,668
constellation where big ideology,
striving for justice -

428
00:31:02,843 --> 00:31:06,259
equality etc,
disintegrates.

429
00:31:06,434 --> 00:31:10,100
The only functioning ideology
is pure consumerism -

430
00:31:10,275 --> 00:31:15,130
and then no wonder what you
get as a form of protest.

431
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:19,265
Every violent acting out
is a sign that -

432
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,547
there is something you are not
able to put into words.

433
00:31:23,722 --> 00:31:27,949
Even the most brutal violence
is the enacting -

434
00:31:28,124 --> 00:31:32,328
of a certain
symbolic deadlock.

435
00:31:34,424 --> 00:31:37,971
The great thing about
the 'Taxi Driver' -

436
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:43,643
is that it brings this brutal
outburst of violence -

437
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:48,318
to it's radical
suicidal dimension.

438
00:31:51,825 --> 00:31:53,257
We are not dealing
here with something -

439
00:31:53,432 --> 00:32:00,099
which simply concerns
the fragile psychology -

440
00:32:00,274 --> 00:32:04,976
of a distorted person,
what Travis in Taxi Driver is.

441
00:32:05,151 --> 00:32:08,513
It has something to do
with ideology.

442
00:32:08,688 --> 00:32:11,063
<i>- Listen you fuckers,
you screw-heads.</i>

443
00:32:11,238 --> 00:32:13,815
<i>- Here is a man who would
not take it anymore.</i>

444
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,877
<i>- Who would not let...</i>

445
00:32:16,052 --> 00:32:19,435
<i>- Listen you fuckers,
you screw-heads.</i>

446
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:22,576
<i>- Here is a man who would
not take it anymore.</i>

447
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:24,880
<i>- A man who stood up
against the scum -</i>

448
00:32:25,055 --> 00:32:27,341
<i>the cunts, the dogs,
the filth, the shit.</i>

449
00:32:27,516 --> 00:32:30,313
- Here is someone
who stood up.

450
00:32:30,488 --> 00:32:33,741
In the 'Taxi Driver',
Travis, the hero -

451
00:32:33,916 --> 00:32:38,932
is bothered by the young prostitute
played by Jody Foster.

452
00:32:39,107 --> 00:32:43,305
What bothers him are,
of course as is always the case -

453
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,829
precisely his fantasies.

454
00:32:46,004 --> 00:32:47,551
Fantasies of her.

455
00:32:47,726 --> 00:32:52,180
Victim who of her
hidden pleasures...

456
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,449
And fantasies are not just
a private matter of individuals.

457
00:32:57,624 --> 00:33:03,913
Fantasies are the central stuff
our ideologies are made of.

458
00:33:04,088 --> 00:33:05,989
<i>- Don't look at him.</i>

459
00:33:06,164 --> 00:33:10,107
Fantasy is in psychoanalytical
perspective -

460
00:33:10,282 --> 00:33:12,417
fundamentally a lie.

461
00:33:12,592 --> 00:33:14,764
Not a lie in the sense that
it's just a fantasy -

462
00:33:14,939 --> 00:33:18,521
but not a reality
but a lie in the sense that -

463
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:23,945
fantasy covers up a certain
gap in consistency.

464
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,683
When things are blurred,
when we cannot really get -

465
00:33:26,858 --> 00:33:32,712
to know things, fantasy
provides an easy answer.

466
00:33:35,484 --> 00:33:40,464
The usual mode of fantasy
is to construct a scene -

467
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:43,352
not a scene where
I get what I desire -

468
00:33:43,527 --> 00:33:50,589
but a scene in which I imagine
myself as desired by others.

469
00:33:53,102 --> 00:33:57,077
'Taxi Driver' is an
unacknowledged remake of -

470
00:33:57,252 --> 00:34:00,104
perhaps the greatest
of John Ford's westerns -

471
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:03,234
his late classic 'The Searchers'.

472
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:07,856
<i>- I take many...?
- Scalps.</i>

473
00:34:12,224 --> 00:34:15,459
In both films,
the hero tries to save -

474
00:34:15,634 --> 00:34:23,272
a young woman who is perceived
as a victim of brutal abuse.

475
00:34:27,777 --> 00:34:30,583
In the Searchers the
young Nathalie Wood -

476
00:34:30,758 --> 00:34:33,932
was kidnapped and lived
for a couple of years -

477
00:34:34,107 --> 00:34:39,137
as the wife of an Indian chief.

478
00:34:39,312 --> 00:34:41,911
In Taxi driver
the young Jodie Foster -

479
00:34:42,086 --> 00:34:44,796
is controlled by
a ruthless pimp.

480
00:34:44,971 --> 00:34:47,172
<i>- You walk out with those
fucking creeps and lowlifes -</i>

481
00:34:47,347 --> 00:34:49,072
<i>and degenerates
out on the streets -</i>

482
00:34:49,247 --> 00:34:51,909
<i>and you sell your little pussy
for nothing man?</i>

483
00:34:52,084 --> 00:34:54,085
<i>For some low life pimp?</i>

484
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,148
<i>Stands in a hall?</i>

485
00:34:57,323 --> 00:34:58,549
<i>- I'm the- I'm square?</i>

486
00:34:58,724 --> 00:35:00,485
<i>-  You're the one
that's square man.</i>

487
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,235
<i>- I don't go screw and
fuck with a bunch of killers -</i>

488
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,756
<i>and junkies the way you do.</i>

489
00:35:03,931 --> 00:35:09,501
The task is always to save
the perceived victim.

490
00:35:10,626 --> 00:35:14,541
But what really drives
this violence of the hero -

491
00:35:14,716 --> 00:35:19,597
is a deep suspicion that
the victim is not simply a victim.

492
00:35:19,772 --> 00:35:23,095
That the victim, effectively
in a perverted way -

493
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:29,026
enjoys or participates in what
appears as her victimhood.

494
00:35:29,201 --> 00:35:31,266
So that, to put it very simply -

495
00:35:31,441 --> 00:35:35,691
she doesn't want to be redeemed,
she resists it.

496
00:35:43,095 --> 00:35:45,323
<i>- Let's go home Debby.</i>

497
00:35:49,602 --> 00:35:52,301
And this is the big problem -

498
00:35:52,476 --> 00:35:55,138
if I make an immediate jump
to the political dimension -

499
00:35:55,313 --> 00:35:58,274
the big problem of American
military interventions -

500
00:35:58,449 --> 00:36:01,608
especially so-called
humanitarian interventions.

501
00:36:01,783 --> 00:36:08,392
From Iraq to already
Vietnam half a century ago.

502
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:11,035
We try to help them -

503
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:15,469
but what if they really
did not want our help?

504
00:36:15,644 --> 00:36:17,517
The result of this
debilitating deadlock -

505
00:36:17,692 --> 00:36:20,428
can only be an
outburst of violence.

506
00:36:24,752 --> 00:36:27,238
We do get, towards
the end of the film -

507
00:36:27,413 --> 00:36:31,142
Travis exploding
in a killing spree.

508
00:36:31,317 --> 00:36:36,865
Killing the pimps, all the
people around the young girl.

509
00:36:42,315 --> 00:36:46,310
Violence is never
just abstract violence.

510
00:36:46,485 --> 00:36:51,344
It's a kind of brutal
intervention in the real -

511
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:56,679
to cover up a certain
impotence concerning -

512
00:36:56,854 --> 00:36:59,366
what we may call
cognitive mapping.

513
00:36:59,541 --> 00:37:03,632
You lack a clear picture
of what's going on.

514
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:05,618
Where are we?

515
00:37:05,793 --> 00:37:10,279
Exactly the same holds
for the terrifying outburst of -

516
00:37:10,454 --> 00:37:16,849
violence; Anders Behring Breivik's
murder spree in Oslo.

517
00:37:17,024 --> 00:37:19,964
Exploding a bomb in front
of the government building -

518
00:37:20,139 --> 00:37:23,164
and then killing dozens
of young members -

519
00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:24,956
of the social democratic party -

520
00:37:25,131 --> 00:37:27,996
in an island close to Oslo.

521
00:37:30,617 --> 00:37:33,188
Many commentators
tried to dismiss this as -

522
00:37:33,363 --> 00:37:36,580
a clear case of personal insanity.

523
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:41,486
But I think Breivik's manifesto
is well worth reading.

524
00:37:41,661 --> 00:37:47,380
It is palpably clear
there how this violence -

525
00:37:47,555 --> 00:37:52,985
that Breivik not only theorised
about but also enacted -

526
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:57,102
is a reaction
to the impenetrability -

527
00:37:57,277 --> 00:38:00,052
and confusion of global capital.

528
00:38:00,227 --> 00:38:05,806
It's exactly like Travis Bickle's
killing spree -

529
00:38:05,981 --> 00:38:09,550
at the end of the 'Taxi Driver'.

530
00:38:12,198 --> 00:38:14,245
When he is there,
barely alive -

531
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:18,085
he symbolically with
his fingers points a gun -

532
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,069
at his own head.

533
00:38:20,244 --> 00:38:24,169
Clear sign that all this
violence was basically suicidal.

534
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,898
He was on the right path,
in a way -

535
00:38:28,073 --> 00:38:30,266
Travis in the 'Taxi Driver'.

536
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:32,314
You should have the
outburst of violence -

537
00:38:32,489 --> 00:38:35,045
and you should
direct it at yourself -

538
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:40,314
but in a very specific way
at what in yourself -

539
00:38:40,489 --> 00:38:45,445
change you, ties you
to the ruling ideology.

540
00:38:57,229 --> 00:38:59,888
<i>- Pippin? Pippin?</i>

541
00:39:00,063 --> 00:39:02,704
In Steven Spielberg's Jaws -

542
00:39:02,879 --> 00:39:08,346
a shark starts to attack
people on the beach.

543
00:39:08,521 --> 00:39:10,906
What does this attack mean?

544
00:39:11,081 --> 00:39:14,281
What does the shark stand for?

545
00:39:18,342 --> 00:39:21,191
There were different,
even mutually exclusive -

546
00:39:21,366 --> 00:39:23,718
answers to this question.

547
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,253
On the one hand
some critics claimed -

548
00:39:32,428 --> 00:39:37,020
that obviously the shark stands
for the foreign threat -

549
00:39:37,195 --> 00:39:39,516
to ordinary Americans.

550
00:39:39,691 --> 00:39:43,719
The shark is a metaphor
for either natural disaster -

551
00:39:43,894 --> 00:39:46,961
storms or immigrants
threatening -

552
00:39:47,136 --> 00:39:49,479
United States citizens
and so on.

553
00:39:49,654 --> 00:39:52,935
On the other hand
it's interesting to note that -

554
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:55,559
Fidel Castro,
who loves the film -

555
00:39:55,734 --> 00:39:59,199
once said that for him
it was obvious that -

556
00:39:59,374 --> 00:40:02,049
Jaws is kind of
a leftist Marxist film -

557
00:40:02,224 --> 00:40:05,176
and that the shark
is a metaphor for -

558
00:40:05,351 --> 00:40:12,017
brutal big capital
exploiting ordinary Americans.

559
00:40:13,867 --> 00:40:16,656
So which is
the right answer?

560
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:21,912
I claim none of them and
at the same time all of them.

561
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:25,453
Ordinary Americans, as ordinary
people in all countries -

562
00:40:25,628 --> 00:40:27,942
have a multitude of fears.

563
00:40:28,117 --> 00:40:29,948
We fear all kind of things.

564
00:40:30,123 --> 00:40:34,150
We fear maybe,
immigrants or people -

565
00:40:34,325 --> 00:40:37,400
whom we perceive as lower
than ourselves attacking us,

566
00:40:37,575 --> 00:40:40,792
robbing us. We fear people
raping our children.

567
00:40:40,967 --> 00:40:44,118
We fear natural disasters,
tornados, earthquakes, -

568
00:40:44,293 --> 00:40:48,208
tsunamis, we fear
corrupted politicians.

569
00:40:48,383 --> 00:40:51,458
We fear big companies
which can basically -

570
00:40:51,633 --> 00:40:54,785
do with us
whatever they want.

571
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:01,938
The function of the shark
is to unite all these fears

572
00:41:02,113 --> 00:41:05,411
so that we can in away
trade all these fears

573
00:41:05,586 --> 00:41:07,970
for one fear alone.

574
00:41:10,406 --> 00:41:11,805
<i>- Smile you son of a...</i>

575
00:41:17,557 --> 00:41:23,187
In this way our experience
of reality gets much simpler.

576
00:41:23,362 --> 00:41:26,763
Why am I mentioning this?
Because isn't it that -

577
00:41:26,938 --> 00:41:31,168
for example, the most extreme
case of ideology -

578
00:41:31,343 --> 00:41:33,854
maybe in the history
of humanity -

579
00:41:34,029 --> 00:41:37,541
the Nazi fascist anti-Semitism -

580
00:41:37,716 --> 00:41:39,944
work precisely in
the same way?

581
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:43,673
Imagine an ordinary
German citizen -

582
00:41:43,848 --> 00:41:46,400
in the late 20s early 30s.

583
00:41:46,575 --> 00:41:50,237
His situation is,
in an abstract way -

584
00:41:50,412 --> 00:41:53,091
the same as that
of a small child.

585
00:41:53,266 --> 00:41:55,028
He's totally perplexed.

586
00:41:55,203 --> 00:41:59,261
Social authority, symbolic
order is telling him -

587
00:41:59,436 --> 00:42:02,891
you are a German worker,
banker, whatever, -

588
00:42:03,066 --> 00:42:04,876
but nothing functions.

589
00:42:05,051 --> 00:42:06,991
What does society
want from him?

590
00:42:07,166 --> 00:42:09,494
Why is everything
going wrong?

591
00:42:09,669 --> 00:42:11,567
The way he perceives
the situation -

592
00:42:11,742 --> 00:42:13,493
is that newspapers
lie to him.

593
00:42:13,668 --> 00:42:15,708
He lost his work
because of inflation.

594
00:42:15,883 --> 00:42:21,085
He lost all his
money in the bank.

595
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:24,095
His moral degradation
and so on...

596
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:26,249
So what's the
meaning of this all?

597
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:41,141
The original fascist
dream is to -

598
00:42:41,316 --> 00:42:44,101
of course as the dream
of every ideology -

599
00:42:44,276 --> 00:42:47,871
to have a cake
and to eat it.

600
00:42:48,841 --> 00:42:52,243
As it was often pointed
out, fascism is, -

601
00:42:52,418 --> 00:42:56,724
at it's most elementary,
a conservative revolution

602
00:42:56,899 --> 00:42:58,928
Revolution; economic
development, -

603
00:42:59,103 --> 00:43:01,168
modern industry, yes.

604
00:43:01,343 --> 00:43:03,941
But a revolution which
would none the less -

605
00:43:04,116 --> 00:43:11,465
maintain or even reassert
a traditional hierarchal society.

606
00:43:15,806 --> 00:43:18,143
A society which is
modern, efficient, -

607
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:20,667
but at the same time
controlled by -

608
00:43:20,842 --> 00:43:25,921
hierarchal values with no
class or other antagonisms.

609
00:43:29,581 --> 00:43:33,004
Now, they have a problem
here, the fascists, -

610
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:37,996
but antagonism, class
struggle and other dangers -

611
00:43:38,171 --> 00:43:42,035
is something inherent
to capitalism.

612
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:44,359
Modernisation,
industrialisation, -

613
00:43:44,534 --> 00:43:46,515
as we know from
the history of capitalism, -

614
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:50,491
means disintegration
of old stable relations.

615
00:43:50,666 --> 00:43:53,115
It means social conflicts.

616
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:59,058
Instability is the way
capitalism functions.

617
00:44:00,045 --> 00:44:03,787
So how to solve
this problem? Simple.

618
00:44:03,962 --> 00:44:08,097
You need to generate
an ideological narrative -

619
00:44:08,272 --> 00:44:12,215
which explains how
things went wrong -

620
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:16,353
in a society, not
as a result of the -

621
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:20,335
inherent tensions in the
development of this society -

622
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:25,597
but as the result
of a foreign intruder.

623
00:44:27,678 --> 00:44:34,501
Things were ok until Jews
penetrated our social body.

624
00:44:34,676 --> 00:44:38,476
The way to restore the
health of our social body -

625
00:44:38,651 --> 00:44:42,635
is to eliminate the Jews.

626
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:48,179
It's the same operation
as with -

627
00:44:48,354 --> 00:44:50,014
the shark in jaws.

628
00:44:50,189 --> 00:44:52,629
You have a multitude
of fears -

629
00:44:52,804 --> 00:44:56,128
and this multiplicity
of fears confuses you -

630
00:44:56,303 --> 00:44:58,099
Like you simply
don't know -

631
00:44:58,274 --> 00:45:00,129
what's the meaning
of all this confusion.

632
00:45:00,304 --> 00:45:03,364
And you replace this
confused multitude -

633
00:45:03,539 --> 00:45:06,145
with one clear figure:

634
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:10,093
the Jew. And everything
becomes clear.

635
00:45:10,268 --> 00:45:12,618
<i>- The search for cuts in</i>
<i>the social security provision -</i>

636
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:16,163
<i>to lone parent families</i>
<i>in part spurred this report.</i>

637
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:17,821
<i>The social security</i>
<i>department fears -</i>

638
00:45:17,996 --> 00:45:19,056
<i>that the accelerating budget -</i>

639
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:20,614
<i>for single mothers</i>
<i>on benefits -</i>

640
00:45:20,789 --> 00:45:22,555
<i>could reach nearly</i>
<i>5 billion pounds -</i>

641
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:24,167
<i>by the end of the decade.</i>

642
00:45:24,342 --> 00:45:26,046
<i>But the issue</i>
<i>of the lone parent -</i>

643
00:45:26,221 --> 00:45:27,812
<i> has increasingly been</i>
<i>seen as the heart -</i>

644
00:45:27,987 --> 00:45:30,382
<i>of John Major's back to </i>
<i>basics crusade.</i>

645
00:45:30,557 --> 00:45:34,414
Remember I think around
two, three decades ago -

646
00:45:34,589 --> 00:45:37,028
when the prime minister of
the United Kingdom was -

647
00:45:37,203 --> 00:45:38,711
John Major -

648
00:45:38,886 --> 00:45:41,502
there was a kind of
ideological campaign -

649
00:45:41,677 --> 00:45:44,116
to return to
morality and so on.

650
00:45:44,291 --> 00:45:48,502
And all the evils of society -

651
00:45:48,677 --> 00:45:52,401
were embodied in the
conservative narrative -

652
00:45:52,576 --> 00:45:55,633
in the figure of -

653
00:45:56,475 --> 00:45:59,180
unemployed single mother.

654
00:45:59,355 --> 00:46:02,237
Like there is violence
in our suburbs?

655
00:46:02,412 --> 00:46:04,939
Of course, because single
unemployed mothers -

656
00:46:05,114 --> 00:46:07,465
cannot take care
of their children -

657
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,810
don't properly educate
them and so on.

658
00:46:11,095 --> 00:46:14,553
We have a lack in our budget,
not enough money, -

659
00:46:14,728 --> 00:46:18,895
of course, because we have
to support unwed -

660
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:21,817
single mothers
and so on and so on.

661
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:24,699
In an ideological edifice -

662
00:46:24,874 --> 00:46:28,155
you need some pseudo
concrete image like this -

663
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:30,237
to fixate your imagination -

664
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:33,159
and then this image
can mobilise us.

665
00:46:39,228 --> 00:46:43,528
Imagine ideology
as a kind of a filter.

666
00:46:43,703 --> 00:46:47,648
A frame, so that if
you look at the same -

667
00:46:47,823 --> 00:46:51,813
ordinary reality through
that frame -

668
00:46:51,988 --> 00:46:54,338
everything changes.
In what sense?

669
00:46:54,513 --> 00:46:59,345
It's not that the frame
actually adds anything;

670
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:05,678
It's just that the frame opens
the abyss of suspicion.

671
00:47:12,944 --> 00:47:15,826
If we look at the anti-Semitic
image of the Jew -

672
00:47:16,001 --> 00:47:18,362
it's crucial to notice how
contradictory this figure -

673
00:47:18,537 --> 00:47:19,944
of the Jew is.

674
00:47:32,261 --> 00:47:35,142
Jews are at the same time
extra intellectual -

675
00:47:35,317 --> 00:47:37,502
like mathematicians,
whatever, -

676
00:47:37,677 --> 00:47:39,083
and vulgar.

677
00:47:45,064 --> 00:47:47,501
Not washing regularly.

678
00:47:53,172 --> 00:47:57,204
Seducing innocent girls all the
time and so on and so on.

679
00:48:55,286 --> 00:48:57,725
This is typical for racism.

680
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:02,023
You try to imagine how
the other enjoys -

681
00:49:02,198 --> 00:49:06,232
all the secret orgies or
whatever, because in racism -

682
00:49:06,407 --> 00:49:09,554
the other is not
simply an enemy, -

683
00:49:09,729 --> 00:49:13,630
Usually it is also
invested with -

684
00:49:13,805 --> 00:49:17,529
some specific
perverse enjoyment or -

685
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:20,763
in an inverted way,
the other can be someone -

686
00:49:20,938 --> 00:49:25,327
who tries to steal from us
our enjoyment, our...

687
00:49:25,502 --> 00:49:29,844
to disturb, as we usually
put it; our way of life.

688
00:49:31,837 --> 00:49:34,631
We should be here
very precise -

689
00:49:34,806 --> 00:49:38,926
not to fall into the usual
trap of disqualifying -

690
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:44,420
all elements out of which
the Nazi ideological edifice -

691
00:49:44,595 --> 00:49:49,869
is composed, to disqualify all
them as proto-fascist.

692
00:49:52,837 --> 00:49:55,692
We should never forget that
the large majority -

693
00:49:55,867 --> 00:50:00,529
of these elements which we
today associate with fascism -

694
00:50:00,704 --> 00:50:04,401
were taken from
the workers' movement.

695
00:50:07,989 --> 00:50:12,863
This idea of large numbers of
people marching together -

696
00:50:13,038 --> 00:50:18,135
this idea of strict bodily
discipline as our duty;

697
00:50:19,154 --> 00:50:24,072
the Nazis directly took this over
from social democracy -

698
00:50:24,247 --> 00:50:25,979
from the left.

699
00:50:26,154 --> 00:50:28,679
Let me just take some other
central concepts -

700
00:50:28,854 --> 00:50:30,274
of the Nazi world-view;

701
00:50:30,449 --> 00:50:32,445
the solidarity of the people.

702
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:35,901
My God, there is nothing bad
in this notion as such.

703
00:50:36,876 --> 00:50:40,553
The problem is solidarity
to what kind of people?

704
00:50:40,728 --> 00:50:43,698
If by people you mean
'Volksgemeinschaft' -

705
00:50:43,873 --> 00:50:45,737
the organic community
of people -

706
00:50:45,912 --> 00:50:48,661
where then the enemy
is automatically -

707
00:50:48,836 --> 00:50:50,876
the foreign intruder, -

708
00:50:51,051 --> 00:50:54,066
in this case
we are in Nazism.

709
00:50:56,990 --> 00:51:03,104
The crucial thing is to locate
ideology where it belongs.

710
00:51:03,279 --> 00:51:05,939
Let's take a clear example.

711
00:51:06,114 --> 00:51:09,439
The well known song
'Tomorrow Belongs To Me' -

712
00:51:09,614 --> 00:51:11,610
from the film 'Cabaret'.

713
00:51:11,785 --> 00:51:17,963
<i>- The sun on the meadow</i>
<i>is summery warm -</i>

714
00:51:18,138 --> 00:51:24,761
<i>the stag in the forest</i>
<i>runs free... </i>

715
00:51:24,936 --> 00:51:28,453
Some of my friends after
seeing the film, -

716
00:51:28,628 --> 00:51:30,173
Bob Fosse's 'Cabaret' -

717
00:51:30,348 --> 00:51:33,027
thought that after
they heard this song -

718
00:51:33,202 --> 00:51:36,712
they finally understood
what at it's deepest -

719
00:51:36,887 --> 00:51:41,713
as to its emotional impact,
what fascism is.

720
00:51:41,888 --> 00:51:46,580
But I think this precisely
is the mistake to be avoided.

721
00:51:47,587 --> 00:51:51,070
This song is rather ordinary
popular song.

722
00:51:51,245 --> 00:51:54,259
Incidentally it was composed
while they were -

723
00:51:54,434 --> 00:51:57,280
shooting the movie
by a Jewish couple.

724
00:51:57,455 --> 00:51:59,085
Nice irony.

725
00:51:59,882 --> 00:52:04,162
If you look not only at the
music, at the way it is sung, -

726
00:52:04,337 --> 00:52:06,595
but even at the words:

727
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:10,204
"awakening of a nation,
tomorrow belongs to me..."

728
00:52:10,379 --> 00:52:13,939
One can well imagine with
a slight change of words -

729
00:52:14,114 --> 00:52:17,254
radically leftist,
communist song.

730
00:52:20,191 --> 00:52:26,359
<i>- But soon says the whisper;</i>
<i>arise, arise...</i>

731
00:52:33,744 --> 00:52:36,807
The German hard rock
band 'Rammstein' -

732
00:52:36,982 --> 00:52:40,416
are often accused of flirting,
playing with -

733
00:52:40,591 --> 00:52:43,479
the Nazi militaristic
iconography.

734
00:52:43,654 --> 00:52:46,416
But if one observes
closely their show -

735
00:52:46,591 --> 00:52:49,647
one can see very nicely
what they are doing.

736
00:52:49,822 --> 00:52:55,018
Exemplarily in one of their best
known songs 'Reise Reise'.

737
00:53:02,865 --> 00:53:06,473
<i>- Reise, reise,
Seemann reise -</i>

738
00:53:06,648 --> 00:53:10,124
<i>Jeder tut's auf seine Weise -</i>

739
00:53:10,299 --> 00:53:13,725
<i>Der eine stößt den</i>
<i>Speer zum Mann -</i>

740
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:16,880
<i>- Der andere zum Fische dann.</i>

741
00:53:17,055 --> 00:53:20,488
<i>- Reise, reise,</i>
<i>Seemann reise...</i>

742
00:53:20,663 --> 00:53:23,803
The minimal elements
of the Nazi ideology -

743
00:53:23,978 --> 00:53:27,160
enacted by 'Rammstein'
are something like

744
00:53:27,335 --> 00:53:31,608
pure elements of
libidinal investment.

745
00:53:39,748 --> 00:53:42,434
Enjoyment has to be,
as it were, -

746
00:53:42,609 --> 00:53:46,084
condensed in some
minimal tics: gestures, -

747
00:53:46,259 --> 00:53:50,154
which do not have any
precise ideological meaning.

748
00:53:51,204 --> 00:53:54,141
What 'Rammstein' does is -

749
00:53:54,316 --> 00:53:59,596
it liberates these elements
from their Nazi articulations.

750
00:54:00,183 --> 00:54:05,890
It allows us to enjoy them in
their pre-ideological state.

751
00:54:17,681 --> 00:54:22,506
The way to fight Nazism
is to enjoy these elements, -

752
00:54:22,681 --> 00:54:24,688
ridiculous as they
may appear, -

753
00:54:24,863 --> 00:54:29,010
by suspending the
Nazi horizon of meaning.

754
00:54:29,185 --> 00:54:34,381
This way you undermine
Nazism from within.

755
00:54:55,949 --> 00:54:58,802
So how does none the less
ideology do this?

756
00:54:58,977 --> 00:55:03,796
How does it articulate
pre-ideological elements?

757
00:55:03,971 --> 00:55:09,747
These elements can also be
seen as a kind of a bribe.

758
00:55:09,922 --> 00:55:15,209
The way ideology pays us to
seduce us into it's edifice.

759
00:55:15,384 --> 00:55:18,230
These bribes can be
purely libidinal bribes, -

760
00:55:18,405 --> 00:55:21,041
all those tics which are
condensed enjoyment.

761
00:55:21,216 --> 00:55:24,356
Or they can be explicit
discursive elements like -

762
00:55:24,531 --> 00:55:30,231
notions of solidarity
of collective discipline, -

763
00:55:30,406 --> 00:55:34,091
struggle for one's destiny
and so on and so on.

764
00:55:34,266 --> 00:55:39,588
All these in itself are
free floating elements -

765
00:55:39,763 --> 00:55:45,882
which open themselves to
different ideological fields.

766
00:55:46,057 --> 00:55:52,517
Let's turn to the high point
of our consumerism.

767
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:57,141
Let me take a drink...

768
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:02,381
Some of it ??
'Starbucks' coffee.

769
00:56:02,556 --> 00:56:07,416
I am regularly drinking it,
I must admit it.

770
00:56:07,591 --> 00:56:11,578
But are we aware that
when we buy a cappuccino -

771
00:56:11,753 --> 00:56:16,869
from 'Starbucks', we also buy
quite a lot of ideology.

772
00:56:17,044 --> 00:56:18,565
Which ideology?

773
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:21,545
You know when you enter
a 'Starbucks' store -

774
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,371
it's usually always displayed
in some posters there, -

775
00:56:24,546 --> 00:56:25,809
their message which is:

776
00:56:25,984 --> 00:56:29,354
Yes our cappuccino is more
expensive than others -

777
00:56:29,529 --> 00:56:31,820
but - and then
comes the story:

778
00:56:31,995 --> 00:56:35,622
We give one percent of
all our income to some -

779
00:56:35,797 --> 00:56:38,910
Guatemala children
to keep them healthy.

780
00:56:39,085 --> 00:56:42,250
For the water supply
for some Sahara farmers, -

781
00:56:42,425 --> 00:56:46,874
or to save the forests, to enable
organic growing coffee...

782
00:56:47,049 --> 00:56:48,364
whatever, whatever.

783
00:56:48,539 --> 00:56:52,320
Now I admire the ingeniosity
of this solution.

784
00:56:52,495 --> 00:56:56,892
In the old days of
pure simple consumerism -

785
00:56:57,067 --> 00:57:00,232
you bought a product
and then you felt bad.

786
00:57:00,407 --> 00:57:02,903
My God, I'm just
a consumerist -

787
00:57:03,078 --> 00:57:05,164
while people are
starving in Africa.

788
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:10,096
So the idea was you had to
do something to counteract -

789
00:57:10,271 --> 00:57:12,562
your pure distractive
consumerism.

790
00:57:12,737 --> 00:57:14,926
For example, I don't know,
you contribute -

791
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:16,724
to charity and so on.

792
00:57:16,899 --> 00:57:22,735
What 'Starbucks' enables you
is to be a consumerist and -

793
00:57:23,762 --> 00:57:26,331
be a consumerist without
any bad conscience -

794
00:57:26,506 --> 00:57:29,517
because the price
for the counter measure, -

795
00:57:29,692 --> 00:57:31,418
for fighting consumerism -

796
00:57:31,593 --> 00:57:35,168
is already included into
the price of a commodity.

797
00:57:35,343 --> 00:57:37,840
Like you pay a little bit more
and you are not just -

798
00:57:38,015 --> 00:57:44,621
a consumerist but you do also
your duty towards environment -

799
00:57:44,796 --> 00:57:48,886
the poor starving people in
Africa and so on and so on.

800
00:57:49,061 --> 00:57:52,585
It's, I think, the ultimate
form of consumerism.

801
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:56,901
We should not simply
oppose a principal life -

802
00:57:57,076 --> 00:58:04,710
dedicated to duty and enjoying
our small pleasures.

803
00:58:04,885 --> 00:58:07,895
Let's take today's capitalism.

804
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:11,954
We have, on the one hand,
the demands of the circulation -

805
00:58:12,129 --> 00:58:16,732
of the capital which push us
towards profit making -

806
00:58:16,907 --> 00:58:22,075
expansion, exploitation and
destruction of nature and, -

807
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:25,775
on the other hand,
ecological demands:

808
00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:30,142
let's think about our posterity
and about our own survival, -

809
00:58:30,317 --> 00:58:34,714
let's take care of
nature and so on.

810
00:58:34,889 --> 00:58:38,362
In this opposition between
ruthless pursuit of -

811
00:58:38,537 --> 00:58:43,243
capitalist expansion and
ecological awareness -

812
00:58:43,418 --> 00:58:46,582
duty, a strange perverted
duty of course -

813
00:58:46,757 --> 00:58:52,542
duty is on the side
of capitalism, -

814
00:58:52,717 --> 00:58:57,680
as many perspicuous
analysts noted.

815
00:58:57,855 --> 00:59:03,588
Capitalism has a strange
religious structure.

816
00:59:03,763 --> 00:59:07,544
It is propelled by this
absolute demand:

817
00:59:07,719 --> 00:59:13,093
capital has to circulate to
reproduce itself to expand -

818
00:59:13,268 --> 00:59:15,764
to multiply itself and
for this goal -

819
00:59:15,939 --> 00:59:19,104
anything can be sacrificed,
up to our lives, -

820
00:59:19,279 --> 00:59:21,005
up to nature and so on.

821
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:24,807
Here we have a strange
unconditional injunction.

822
00:59:24,982 --> 00:59:27,222
A true capitalist is a miser
who is ready -

823
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:32,000
to sacrifice everything
for this perverted duty.

824
00:59:40,374 --> 00:59:43,765
What we see here in
Mojave desert -

825
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:47,824
at this resting place for
abandoned planes -

826
00:59:47,999 --> 00:59:53,013
is the other side of
capitalist dynamics.

827
00:59:56,198 --> 00:59:59,384
Capitalism is all
the time in crisis.

828
00:59:59,559 --> 01:00:04,162
This is precisely why it appears
almost indestructible.

829
01:00:04,337 --> 01:00:06,525
Crisis is not its obstacle.

830
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,683
It is what pushes
it forwards -

831
01:00:08,858 --> 01:00:12,279
towards permanent
self-revolutionising -

832
01:00:12,454 --> 01:00:16,030
permanent, extended
self-reproduction, -

833
01:00:16,205 --> 01:00:17,879
always new products.

834
01:00:18,054 --> 01:00:22,555
The other invisible side
of it is waste, -

835
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:26,511
tremendous amount of waste.

836
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:31,237
We shouldn't react to
these heaps of waste -

837
01:00:31,412 --> 01:00:36,426
by trying to somehow
get rid of it.

838
01:00:37,505 --> 01:00:42,283
Maybe the first thing to do
is to accept this waste.

839
01:00:42,458 --> 01:00:45,777
To accept that there
are things out there -

840
01:00:45,952 --> 01:00:48,706
which serve nothing.

841
01:00:48,881 --> 01:00:54,203
To break out of this eternal
cycle of functioning.

842
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:04,273
The German philosopher
Walter Benjamin -

843
01:01:04,448 --> 01:01:07,150
said something very deep.

844
01:01:07,325 --> 01:01:10,592
He said that we
experience history, -

845
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:13,572
what does it mean for us to
be historical beings, -

846
01:01:13,747 --> 01:01:18,350
not when we are engaged in
things, when things move, -

847
01:01:18,525 --> 01:01:21,638
only when we see
this, again, -

848
01:01:21,813 --> 01:01:25,183
rest waste of culture being
half retaken by nature, -

849
01:01:25,358 --> 01:01:32,119
at that point we get an intuition
of what history means.

850
01:01:35,305 --> 01:01:38,284
Maybe this also accounts
for the redemptic value -

851
01:01:38,459 --> 01:01:41,316
of post-catastrophic movies -

852
01:01:41,491 --> 01:01:45,015
like 'I Am Legend' and so on.

853
01:01:45,529 --> 01:01:49,279
We see the devastated
human environment, -

854
01:01:49,454 --> 01:01:52,105
half empty factories,
machines falling apart, -

855
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,622
half empty stores.

856
01:01:54,797 --> 01:01:58,373
What we experience
at this moment, -

857
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:01,507
the psychoanalytic term
for it would have been -

858
01:02:01,682 --> 01:02:04,024
the 'Inertia of the Real' -

859
01:02:04,199 --> 01:02:08,751
this mute presence
beyond meaning.

860
01:02:10,241 --> 01:02:11,628
What moments like -

861
01:02:11,803 --> 01:02:14,608
confronting planes
here in Mojave Desert -

862
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:16,950
bring to us is
maybe a chance -

863
01:02:17,125 --> 01:02:20,825
for an authentic
passive experience.

864
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,062
Maybe without this
properly artistic -

865
01:02:24,237 --> 01:02:26,990
moment of
authentic passivity -

866
01:02:27,165 --> 01:02:30,638
nothing new can emerge.

867
01:02:32,128 --> 01:02:37,368
Maybe something new only
emerges through the failure, -

868
01:02:37,543 --> 01:02:40,913
the suspension of proper
functioning of the -

869
01:02:41,088 --> 01:02:43,996
existing network of our life -

870
01:02:44,171 --> 01:02:46,873
where we are.

871
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:54,323
Maybe this is what we need
more than ever today.

872
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:13,435
What does the wreck of
the 'Titanic' stand for?

873
01:03:15,593 --> 01:03:17,597
We all know the
standard reading -

874
01:03:17,772 --> 01:03:21,480
of the impact of
the sinking of the Titanic.

875
01:03:21,655 --> 01:03:25,765
Not only the film
but the real accident.

876
01:03:26,433 --> 01:03:30,543
This sinking had such an
impact because it happened -

877
01:03:30,718 --> 01:03:36,606
in a society still at that point
in all its glitz and glory -

878
01:03:36,781 --> 01:03:41,281
unaware of the decay that
awaited it in the near future;

879
01:03:41,456 --> 01:03:44,313
the World Wars and so on.

880
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:46,604
But there is something
in excess -

881
01:03:46,779 --> 01:03:48,731
of this entire field
of meanings -

882
01:03:48,906 --> 01:03:51,762
which is the very
fascinating presence -

883
01:03:51,937 --> 01:03:56,438
of the ruin of the Titanic
at the bottom of the ocean.

884
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,524
When James Cameron
organised -

885
01:04:01,699 --> 01:04:03,939
a trip to the real
wreck of titanic -

886
01:04:04,114 --> 01:04:07,432
he also made a similar remark.

887
01:04:07,607 --> 01:04:10,977
When the explorers
approached the wreck, -

888
01:04:11,152 --> 01:04:14,317
they had this almost
metaphysical experience -

889
01:04:14,492 --> 01:04:17,143
that they are approaching
a forbidden territory -

890
01:04:17,318 --> 01:04:21,766
in which the sacred and
the obscene overlap.

891
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:23,513
<i>- Yeah, Roger that.</i>
<i>Ok drop down -</i>

892
01:04:23,688 --> 01:04:25,825
<i>and go into the first</i>
<i>class gangway door. </i>

894
01:04:27,747 --> 01:04:31,271
Every effective political,
ideological symbol  -

895
01:04:31,446 --> 01:04:35,124
or symptom has to rely
on this dimension of -

896
01:04:35,299 --> 01:04:38,156
petrified enjoyment.

897
01:04:38,331 --> 01:04:44,115
Of the frozen grimace of
an excessive pleasure in pain.

898
01:04:59,631 --> 01:05:03,228
What am I doing here
in the middle of the ocean -

899
01:05:03,403 --> 01:05:07,389
alone in a boat surrounded
by frozen corpses?

900
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:08,571
<i>- Jack?</i>

901
01:05:08,746 --> 01:05:13,246
am in a scene from
James Cameron's 'Titanic' -

902
01:05:13,421 --> 01:05:14,428
<i>- Jack?</i>

903
01:05:14,603 --> 01:05:21,158
which is the supreme case of
ideology in recent Hollywood.

904
01:05:22,186 --> 01:05:25,525
Why? Beause
of the imminent -

905
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:27,837
tension to the story
of the film.

906
01:05:28,012 --> 01:05:29,430
<i>??I don't know this dance.</i>
<i>??Neither do I.</i>

907
01:05:29,605 --> 01:05:31,896
<i>- Just go with it.</i>
<i>Don't think.</i>

908
01:05:32,071 --> 01:05:33,746
We have at least three levels.

909
01:05:33,921 --> 01:05:37,496
First there is what people
ironically refer to as -

910
01:05:37,671 --> 01:05:41,452
James Cameron's
Hollywood Marxism -

911
01:05:43,251 --> 01:05:48,953
this ridiculous fake sympathy
with lower classes.

912
01:05:50,649 --> 01:05:52,601
Up there, first class
passengers -

913
01:05:52,776 --> 01:05:56,197
they are mostly evil,
egotistic, cowardly -

914
01:05:56,372 --> 01:05:58,818
<i>- You know I don't</i>
<i>like that, Rose. </i>

915
01:05:58,993 --> 01:06:00,976
Embodied in Kate
Winslet's fiancé -

916
01:06:01,151 --> 01:06:03,442
played by Billy Zane.
<i>- She knows.</i>

917
01:06:03,801 --> 01:06:06,422
This whole narrative
is sustained -

918
01:06:06,597 --> 01:06:09,761
by a much more
reactionary myth.

919
01:06:12,998 --> 01:06:15,875
<i>- Did you see</i>
<i>those guys' faces?</i>

920
01:06:16,050 --> 01:06:20,704
We should ask what role does
the iceberg hitting the ship -

921
01:06:20,879 --> 01:06:23,992
play in the development
of the love story?

922
01:06:24,167 --> 01:06:28,770
<i>- When the ship docks</i>
<i>I'm getting off with you. </i>

923
01:06:29,695 --> 01:06:31,905
<i>- This is crazy. </i>
<i>- I know.</i>

924
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:35,450
My claim is here
a slightly cynical one.

925
01:06:35,625 --> 01:06:38,584
This would have been
the true catastrophe.

926
01:06:38,759 --> 01:06:43,156
We can imagine how maybe
after two three weeks of -

927
01:06:43,331 --> 01:06:46,033
of intense sex in New York -

928
01:06:46,208 --> 01:06:49,475
the ove affair would
somehow fade away.

929
01:06:49,650 --> 01:06:52,096
<i>- As a paying customer -</i>

930
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:55,795
<i>I expect to get what I want.</i>

931
01:06:58,518 --> 01:07:02,268
Kate Winslet is
an upper class girl -

932
01:07:02,443 --> 01:07:06,225
in psychological
distress confused, -

933
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,666
her ego is in shatters.

934
01:07:09,841 --> 01:07:12,903
and the function
of Leonardo Dicaprio -

935
01:07:13,078 --> 01:07:15,832
<i>- Over on the bed,</i>
<i>the couch.</i>

936
01:07:16,007 --> 01:07:23,384
is simply that he helps her
to reconstitute her ego.

937
01:07:23,559 --> 01:07:25,799
<i>- Good. Lie down. </i>

938
01:07:25,974 --> 01:07:28,984
Her self image, literally
he draws her image.

939
01:07:29,159 --> 01:07:30,217
<i>- Tell me when it looks right.</i>

940
01:07:30,392 --> 01:07:32,118
<i>- Put your arm back</i>
<i>the way it was.</i>

941
01:07:32,293 --> 01:07:35,972
It's really a new version
of one of the old -

942
01:07:36,147 --> 01:07:39,157
favourite imperialist myths.

943
01:07:39,332 --> 01:07:42,343
The idea being that when
the upper class people -

944
01:07:42,518 --> 01:07:44,809
lose their vitality -

945
01:07:44,984 --> 01:07:48,559
they need a contact
with lower classes.

946
01:07:48,734 --> 01:07:53,902
Basically ruthlessly exploiting
them in a vampire like way -

947
01:07:54,077 --> 01:07:57,088
as it were sucking
from them the life energy.

948
01:07:57,263 --> 01:08:01,557
Revitalised they can join their
secluded upper class life.

949
01:08:01,732 --> 01:08:04,537
<i>- My heart was pounding</i>
<i>the whole time. </i>

950
01:08:04,712 --> 01:08:09,059
<i>- It was the most erotic</i>
<i>moment of my life. </i>

951
01:08:12,244 --> 01:08:16,251
<i>- Up until then at least.</i>
The ship hits the iceberg -

952
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:23,033
not immediately after sex but
when the couple goes up -

953
01:08:23,208 --> 01:08:27,606
to the open space and
decide to stay together.

954
01:08:27,914 --> 01:08:31,202
<i>- Oh yes. Hey look at this.</i>

955
01:08:33,309 --> 01:08:35,723
You know, often in history -

956
01:08:35,898 --> 01:08:39,525
the event which may
appear as a catastrophe -

957
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:41,940
saves persons or an idea,

958
01:08:42,115 --> 01:08:44,971
elevating it into a myth.

959
01:08:45,146 --> 01:08:48,105
Remember the intervention
of the Soviet army -

960
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:53,962
and other Warsaw backed armies
in 1968 in Czechoslovakia -

961
01:08:55,144 --> 01:08:58,997
to strangle the so
called Prague Spring.

962
01:08:59,172 --> 01:09:02,593
The attempt of the Czech
democratic communists -

963
01:09:02,768 --> 01:09:07,012
to introduce a more
human faced socialism.

964
01:09:07,783 --> 01:09:11,584
Usually we perceive this
brutal Soviet intervention -

965
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:15,900
as something that destroyed
the brief dream of Prague Spring.

966
01:09:16,075 --> 01:09:19,137
I think it saved the dream.

967
01:09:20,216 --> 01:09:23,658
Either Czechoslovakia would
have turned into an ordinary -

968
01:09:23,833 --> 01:09:26,638
liberal capitalist state -

969
01:09:26,813 --> 01:09:29,669
or at a certain point which
was usually the fate of -

970
01:09:29,844 --> 01:09:33,420
reformist communists,
the communist in power -

971
01:09:33,595 --> 01:09:35,680
would be obliged
to set a certain limit.

972
01:09:35,855 --> 01:09:38,249
Ok, you had you fun,
your freedom -

973
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:43,078
that's enough, now we
again define the limits.

974
01:09:43,253 --> 01:09:47,086
Again, the paradox is precisely
the Soviet intervention -

975
01:09:47,261 --> 01:09:50,323
saved the dream of
the possibility of -

976
01:09:50,498 --> 01:09:52,686
another communism
and so on and so on.

977
01:09:52,861 --> 01:09:55,152
So, here again -

978
01:09:55,769 --> 01:09:58,851
through the temporal
catastrophe -

979
01:09:59,026 --> 01:10:02,962
we have a love story
which is at it were, -

980
01:10:03,137 --> 01:10:07,329
redeemed in it's idea,
saved for eternity.

981
01:10:08,819 --> 01:10:11,541
We can ultimately
read the catastrophe -

982
01:10:11,716 --> 01:10:14,244
as a desperate manoeuvre -

983
01:10:14,419 --> 01:10:18,221
to save the illusion
of eternal love.

984
01:10:22,125 --> 01:10:25,876
We can see how ideology
works effectively here.

985
01:10:26,051 --> 01:10:28,650
We have two
superficial levels.

986
01:10:28,825 --> 01:10:33,069
All the fascination of
the accident, then -

987
01:10:33,244 --> 01:10:36,665
the love story - but all this
which is quite acceptable -

988
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:39,131
for our liberal
progressive minds, -

989
01:10:39,306 --> 01:10:42,522
all this is just a trap.

990
01:10:42,697 --> 01:10:46,016
Something to lower
our attention -

991
01:10:46,191 --> 01:10:49,972
threshold, as it were,
to open us up -

992
01:10:50,147 --> 01:10:55,058
to be ready to accept the
true conservative message -

993
01:10:55,233 --> 01:10:59,785
of rich people having tried
to revitalise themselves -

994
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:05,796
by ruthlessly appropriating the
vitality of the poor people.

995
01:11:05,971 --> 01:11:07,029
<i>- There's no one here sir.</i>

996
01:11:07,204 --> 01:11:09,701
There is a wonderful detail
which tells everything.

997
01:11:09,876 --> 01:11:10,934
<i>- Come back.</i>

998
01:11:11,109 --> 01:11:14,016
When Kate Winslet notices
that Leonardo Dicaprio -

999
01:11:14,191 --> 01:11:17,510
is dead she, of course,
starts to shout:

1000
01:11:17,685 --> 01:11:19,667
"I will never let go,
I will never let go."

1001
01:11:19,842 --> 01:11:22,853
while at the same moment -
<i>- I will never let go.</i>

1002
01:11:23,028 --> 01:11:26,552
<i>- I promise.</i>
she pushes him off.

1003
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:32,872
He is what we may call ironically
a vanishing mediator.

1004
01:11:34,464 --> 01:11:36,930
This logic of the
production of the couple -

1005
01:11:37,105 --> 01:11:39,910
has a long history
in Hollywood.

1006
01:11:40,085 --> 01:11:41,503
Whatever the story is about, -

1007
01:11:41,678 --> 01:11:44,329
it may be about the end of
the world, an asteroid -

1008
01:11:44,504 --> 01:11:47,925
threatening the very
survival of humanity -

1009
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:50,494
or a great war whatever.

1010
01:11:50,669 --> 01:11:54,964
As a rule we always
have a couple whose -

1011
01:11:55,139 --> 01:11:59,279
link is threatened and
who somehow through -

1012
01:11:59,454 --> 01:12:04,880
this ordeal at the end
happily gets together.

1013
01:12:06,472 --> 01:12:09,658
This logic does not hold
only for Hollywood films.

1014
01:12:18,032 --> 01:12:21,474
In the late forties,
in Soviet Union, -

1015
01:12:21,649 --> 01:12:24,197
they produced arguably
one of the most expensive -

1016
01:12:24,372 --> 01:12:25,585
film of all times:

1017
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,793
'The Fall of Berlin'.

1018
01:12:28,616 --> 01:12:31,698
The chronicle of the
second World War -

1019
01:12:31,873 --> 01:12:33,240
from the Soviet standpoint.

1020
01:12:33,415 --> 01:12:35,757
And it's incredible how
closely this film -

1021
01:12:35,932 --> 01:12:39,970
also follows the logic of
the production of a couple.

1022
01:12:40,638 --> 01:12:42,487
The story begins just before -

1023
01:12:42,662 --> 01:12:44,440
the German attack
on the Soviet Union -

1024
01:12:44,615 --> 01:12:47,317
when the model worker
who is in love -

1025
01:12:47,492 --> 01:12:52,763
with a local girl but is too
shy to propose to her, -

1026
01:12:52,938 --> 01:12:57,592
is called to Moscow to get
a medal from Comrade Stalin.

1027
01:12:58,414 --> 01:13:03,501
There Stalin notices his
confusion, distress, -

1028
01:13:03,676 --> 01:13:06,070
and Stalin gives
him some advice -

1029
01:13:06,245 --> 01:13:08,279
which poetry
to quote and so on.

1030
01:13:08,454 --> 01:13:11,259
This part unfortunately
was lost -

1031
01:13:11,434 --> 01:13:15,060
because in the background
of this scene there was Beria -

1032
01:13:15,235 --> 01:13:17,681
a Soviet politician who
after Stalin's death -

1033
01:13:17,856 --> 01:13:19,736
became a 'non-person' -

1034
01:13:19,911 --> 01:13:22,099
was shot as a traitor.

1035
01:13:22,274 --> 01:13:26,312
But we know from the
screenplay what was there.

1036
01:13:26,487 --> 01:13:29,087
If Stalin gives you love
advice it has to succeed -

1037
01:13:29,262 --> 01:13:32,220
so the couple embraces.

1038
01:13:40,492 --> 01:13:44,088
He tells her probably
to make love.

1039
01:13:48,815 --> 01:13:51,333
At that very moment
there is the triumphant -

1040
01:13:51,508 --> 01:13:54,210
violent entrance
of the obstacle:

1041
01:13:54,385 --> 01:13:58,217
German planes come,
dropping bombs.

1042
01:14:08,338 --> 01:14:09,983
The girl is taken prisoner.

1043
01:14:15,737 --> 01:14:18,152
The boy of course joins
the Red Army -

1044
01:14:18,327 --> 01:14:21,594
and we follow him through
all the great battles.

1045
01:14:21,769 --> 01:14:26,012
The idea being that in a
deeper logic of the film, -

1046
01:14:26,187 --> 01:14:28,581
what these battles
were about -

1047
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:32,126
was really to
recreate the couple.

1048
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:35,363
The boy has to get his girl.

1049
01:14:35,538 --> 01:14:37,726
This is what happens
at the end -

1050
01:14:37,901 --> 01:14:41,559
but in a very strange
way which reconfirms -

1051
01:14:41,734 --> 01:14:46,152
Stalin's role as the supreme
divine matchmaker.

1052
01:14:49,954 --> 01:14:53,756
The scene itself, Stalin
emerging himself into -

1053
01:14:53,931 --> 01:14:58,072
a crowd of ordinary people
never happened.

1054
01:14:58,247 --> 01:15:01,360
Stalin was totally paranoid
about flying, -

1055
01:15:01,535 --> 01:15:03,775
about taking planes.

1056
01:15:03,950 --> 01:15:08,758
But none the less when he
saw this scene he cried.

1057
01:15:19,239 --> 01:15:24,017
Of course he himself as you
know, wrote the lines.

1058
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:27,305
When the couple
encounters each other -

1059
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:31,158
the girl first sees Stalin, -

1060
01:15:31,333 --> 01:15:34,498
then she turns around
and, surprised, -

1061
01:15:34,673 --> 01:15:35,885
sees her lover -

1062
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:38,968
for whom she was waiting
all the time of the war.

1063
01:15:41,434 --> 01:15:44,106
So it's only through
the presence of Stalin -

1064
01:15:44,281 --> 01:15:46,983
that the couple
gets reunited.

1065
01:15:59,878 --> 01:16:02,293
This is how ideology works.

1066
01:16:02,468 --> 01:16:04,759
Not the explicit
ideology of the film -

1067
01:16:04,934 --> 01:16:06,814
which we hear at the
end Stalin saying:

1068
01:16:06,989 --> 01:16:09,435
now all the free people
will enjoy peace -

1069
01:16:09,610 --> 01:16:10,668
and so on and so on.

1070
01:16:10,843 --> 01:16:15,651
But precisely ideology
at its more fundamental.

1071
01:16:17,706 --> 01:16:22,227
This apparently totally
subordinated motive -

1072
01:16:22,402 --> 01:16:24,282
unimportant in itself, -

1073
01:16:24,457 --> 01:16:29,574
the story of a couple, this is
what is the key element, -

1074
01:16:29,749 --> 01:16:32,862
which holds the
entire film together, -

1075
01:16:33,037 --> 01:16:37,897
that small surplus element
which attracts us, -

1076
01:16:38,072 --> 01:16:40,774
which maintains
our attention.

1077
01:16:40,949 --> 01:16:44,165
This is how ideology works.

1078
01:16:45,501 --> 01:16:47,351
<i>- Nice.</i>

1079
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:51,255
<i>- Everything clean.</i>

1080
01:16:51,739 --> 01:16:53,670
<i>- Oiled.</i>

1081
01:16:55,519 --> 01:16:58,345
<i>- So that your action</i>
<i>is beautiful.</i>

1082
01:17:02,044 --> 01:17:03,277
<i>- Smooth, Charlene.</i>

1083
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:05,281
We usually think that
military discipline -

1084
01:17:05,456 --> 01:17:09,340
is just a matter of mindlessly
following orders.

1085
01:17:09,515 --> 01:17:11,498
Obeying the rules.

1086
01:17:11,673 --> 01:17:14,324
You don't think you do
what is your duty.

1087
01:17:14,499 --> 01:17:15,865
It's not as simple as that.

1088
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:20,797
If we do this, we just
become machines.

1089
01:17:20,972 --> 01:17:23,417
There has to be
something more.

1090
01:17:23,592 --> 01:17:27,591
This more can have
two basic forms.

1091
01:17:27,766 --> 01:17:33,086
The first more benign form
is an ironic distance.

1092
01:17:33,261 --> 01:17:36,174
Best epitomised by the
well known movie -

1093
01:17:36,349 --> 01:17:38,634
and TV series 'M.A.S.H.'

1094
01:17:38,809 --> 01:17:39,942
<i>- Hawkeye?</i>

1095
01:17:40,117 --> 01:17:42,506
Where the military
doctors are involved -

1096
01:17:42,681 --> 01:17:45,123
in sexual escapades, -

1097
01:17:45,298 --> 01:17:47,845
make jokes all the time.

1098
01:17:48,211 --> 01:17:51,142
Some people took Robert
Altman's movie 'M.A.S.H.' -

1099
01:17:51,317 --> 01:17:55,800
as a kind of antimilitaristic,
satiric product -

1100
01:17:55,975 --> 01:17:57,161
but it's not.

1101
01:17:57,336 --> 01:18:00,039
We should always bear
in mind that these -

1102
01:18:00,214 --> 01:18:02,499
soldiers with all their
practical jokes, -

1103
01:18:02,674 --> 01:18:05,220
making fun of the
serious and so on -

1104
01:18:05,395 --> 01:18:08,413
operated perfectly
as soldiers.

1105
01:18:08,588 --> 01:18:10,664
They did their duty.

1106
01:18:10,839 --> 01:18:13,019
<i>- This one's for you, babe.</i>

1107
01:18:13,194 --> 01:18:17,206
Much more ominous
is a kind of obscene -

1108
01:18:17,381 --> 01:18:22,597
obscene supplement to
pure military discipline.

1109
01:18:22,772 --> 01:18:26,260
In practically all movies
about U.S. Marines, -

1110
01:18:26,435 --> 01:18:29,819
the best-known embodiment
of this obscenity -

1111
01:18:29,994 --> 01:18:32,593
are marching chants.

1112
01:18:32,768 --> 01:18:36,518
A mixture of nonsense:
<i>- I don't know but I've been told.</i>

1113
01:18:36,693 --> 01:18:39,239
<i>- Eskimo pussy is mighty cold.</i>

1114
01:18:39,414 --> 01:18:41,647
And obscenity.

1115
01:18:43,165 --> 01:18:48,294
This is not undermining,
making fun of military discipline.

1116
01:18:49,445 --> 01:18:53,161
It is it's inner most constituent.

1117
01:18:53,336 --> 01:18:57,016
You take this obscene
supplement away -

1118
01:18:57,191 --> 01:19:01,796
and military machine
stops working.

1119
01:19:01,971 --> 01:19:05,041
<i>- Well, no shit. </i>
<i>- What have we got here? </i>

1120
01:19:05,216 --> 01:19:07,397
<i>- A fucking comedian?</i>
<i>- Private Joker. </i>

1121
01:19:07,572 --> 01:19:09,437
<i>- I admire your honesty.</i>

1122
01:19:09,612 --> 01:19:11,112
<i>- Hell, I like you. </i>
<i>- You can come over -</i>

1123
01:19:11,287 --> 01:19:13,939
<i>to my house and</i>
<i>fuck my sister.</i>

1124
01:19:14,410 --> 01:19:15,980
<i>- You little scum bag!</i>

1125
01:19:16,155 --> 01:19:18,596
<i>- I've got your name!</i>
<i>- I've got your ass!</i>

1126
01:19:18,771 --> 01:19:20,742
<i>- You will not laugh.</i>
<i>- You will not cry.</i>

1127
01:19:20,917 --> 01:19:23,307
<i>- You will learn by the numbers.</i>
<i>- I will teach you.</i>

1128
01:19:23,482 --> 01:19:25,348
<i>- Now get up!</i>
<i>- Get on your feet!</i>

1129
01:19:25,767 --> 01:19:28,436
<i>- You had best unfuck yourself</i>
<i>or I will unscrew -</i>

1130
01:19:28,611 --> 01:19:30,477
<i>your head and shit</i>
<i>down your neck.</i>

1131
01:19:30,652 --> 01:19:32,204
<i>- Sir, yes, sir!</i>
<i>- Private Joker -</i>

1132
01:19:32,379 --> 01:19:34,402
<i>why don't you join</i>
<i>my beloved corps?</i>

1133
01:19:34,577 --> 01:19:36,966
I think that the
drill sergeant, -

1134
01:19:37,141 --> 01:19:43,177
the way it is played in
an exemplary way in -

1135
01:19:43,352 --> 01:19:45,864
Stanley Kubrick's
'Full Metal Jacket' -

1136
01:19:46,039 --> 01:19:49,580
that the drill sergeant
is rather a tragic figure.

1137
01:19:49,755 --> 01:19:52,877
I always like to imagine
him as the person who -

1138
01:19:53,052 --> 01:19:56,959
after his work returns home,
is quite decent and so on.

1139
01:19:57,134 --> 01:19:59,000
<i>- This is my rifle,</i>
<i>this is my gun.</i>

1140
01:19:59,175 --> 01:20:02,769
All this obscene shouting
is just a show put on -

1141
01:20:02,944 --> 01:20:05,647
not so much to impress
ordinary soldiers -

1142
01:20:05,822 --> 01:20:08,787
whom he is training
as to bribe them -

1143
01:20:08,962 --> 01:20:11,614
with bits of enjoyment.

1144
01:20:13,445 --> 01:20:16,638
It's not just a question
of these obscenities, -

1145
01:20:16,813 --> 01:20:18,522
which sustains the
military machinery;

1146
01:20:18,731 --> 01:20:22,186
it's another more general rule
which holds for -

1147
01:20:22,361 --> 01:20:25,692
military communities,
but even more -

1148
01:20:25,867 --> 01:20:29,355
I would say, for all
human communities.

1149
01:20:29,530 --> 01:20:33,071
From the largest nations,
ethnic groups, -

1150
01:20:33,246 --> 01:20:36,212
up to small university
departments and so on.

1151
01:20:36,387 --> 01:20:40,346
You don't only have
explicit rules.

1152
01:20:40,521 --> 01:20:45,475
You always, in order to become
part of a community, -

1153
01:20:45,650 --> 01:20:49,191
you need some implicit
unwritten rules -

1154
01:20:49,366 --> 01:20:52,122
which are never
publicly recognised -

1155
01:20:52,297 --> 01:20:55,315
but are absolutely crucial
as the point of -

1156
01:20:55,490 --> 01:20:58,193
the identification
of a group.

1157
01:21:00,444 --> 01:21:03,113
In the U.K. everyone
knows about -

1158
01:21:03,288 --> 01:21:05,520
the obscene
unwritten rituals, -

1159
01:21:05,695 --> 01:21:10,544
which regulate life
in public schools.

1160
01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:12,201
<i>- That'll be all. Thank</i>
<i>you, Finchley.</i>

1161
01:21:12,376 --> 01:21:14,261
<i>- I want to see all whips</i>
<i>in my study after break.</i>

1162
01:21:14,436 --> 01:21:16,615
<i>- Right, sir.</i>
<i>- Oh, how was India? Enjoy it?</i>

1163
01:21:16,790 --> 01:21:17,871
<i>- Jolly good.</i>
<i>- Bridges!</i>

1164
01:21:18,046 --> 01:21:20,436
<i>- I'll labor night and day...</i>

1165
01:21:20,611 --> 01:21:25,303
Just think about Lindsay
Anderson's classic 'If...'.

1166
01:21:26,350 --> 01:21:28,391
The public life
is democratic -

1167
01:21:28,566 --> 01:21:31,270
we have professors who
interact with their pupils, -

1168
01:21:31,445 --> 01:21:35,090
nice atmosphere,
teaching friendship, -

1169
01:21:35,265 --> 01:21:36,922
spirit of cooperation -

1170
01:21:37,097 --> 01:21:39,905
but then we all know
what happens -

1171
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:42,417
beneath the surface.

1172
01:21:46,343 --> 01:21:50,320
Older pupils torturing, sexually
abusing the younger.

1173
01:21:50,495 --> 01:21:55,554
This same mixture of obscenity
and sadistic violence.

1174
01:21:57,072 --> 01:21:59,427
And again what is
crucial here is -

1175
01:21:59,602 --> 01:22:02,358
we should not simply
put all the blame -

1176
01:22:02,533 --> 01:22:06,545
or all the enjoyment
on the older pupils.

1177
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:11,150
The victims even are -

1178
01:22:11,325 --> 01:22:15,494
part of this infernal
cycle of obscenity.

1179
01:22:16,174 --> 01:22:19,681
Its as if in order to really be
a member of a community -

1180
01:22:19,856 --> 01:22:21,879
you have to render
you hands dirty.

1181
01:22:22,054 --> 01:22:26,328
And I think even the
Abu Ghraib scandal -

1182
01:22:26,503 --> 01:22:30,253
of American soldiers
torturing or -

1183
01:22:30,428 --> 01:22:33,759
especially humiliating
Iraqi prisoners -

1184
01:22:33,934 --> 01:22:35,696
is to be read in this way.

1185
01:22:35,871 --> 01:22:39,150
It's not simply, we the
arrogant Americans -

1186
01:22:39,325 --> 01:22:41,192
are humiliating others.

1187
01:22:41,367 --> 01:22:44,646
What Iraqi soldiers
experienced there -

1188
01:22:44,821 --> 01:22:48,414
was the staging of
the obscene underside -

1189
01:22:48,589 --> 01:22:51,868
of the American
military culture.

1190
01:22:53,961 --> 01:22:57,677
In 'Full Metal Jacket' it's
the character of 'Joker' -

1191
01:22:57,852 --> 01:22:59,195
played by
Matthew Modine -

1192
01:22:59,370 --> 01:23:02,388
who is close to what we
would call a normal soldier.

1193
01:23:02,563 --> 01:23:05,162
A 'M.A.S.H.' type of soldier.

1194
01:23:05,528 --> 01:23:07,935
He has proper
ironic distance.

1195
01:23:08,110 --> 01:23:10,447
He proves, at
the end, militarily, -

1196
01:23:10,622 --> 01:23:13,274
the most efficient soldier.

1197
01:23:20,234 --> 01:23:21,595
Returning back to me.

1198
01:23:21,770 --> 01:23:24,578
Why then will I soon
shoot myself?

1199
01:23:24,753 --> 01:23:27,457
Something went wrong
there. But what?

1200
01:23:27,632 --> 01:23:28,765
<i>- Lock and load!</i>

1201
01:23:28,940 --> 01:23:32,743
I did not just run amok.

1202
01:23:33,266 --> 01:23:35,412
<i>- Order.</i>

1203
01:23:37,035 --> 01:23:39,023
<i>- This is my rifle.</i>

1204
01:23:39,198 --> 01:23:42,616
<i>- There are many like it,</i>
<i>but this one is mine.</i>

1205
01:23:42,791 --> 01:23:45,827
But I got too
directly identified -

1206
01:23:46,002 --> 01:23:47,973
with these obscene rituals.

1207
01:23:48,148 --> 01:23:49,595
I lost the distance.

1208
01:23:49,770 --> 01:23:51,584
I took them seriously.

1209
01:23:51,759 --> 01:23:53,607
<i>- What in the name</i>
<i>of Jesus H. Christ -</i>

1210
01:23:53,782 --> 01:23:55,771
<i>are you animals doing</i>
<i>in my head?</i>

1211
01:23:55,946 --> 01:23:58,545
If you get too close to it -

1212
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:01,685
if you over
identify with it -

1213
01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:04,930
if you really immediately
become the voice -

1214
01:24:05,105 --> 01:24:08,908
of this super ego,
it's self destructive.

1215
01:24:09,083 --> 01:24:10,478
You kill people around you -

1216
01:24:10,653 --> 01:24:13,513
you end up
killing yourself.

1217
01:24:35,547 --> 01:24:37,431
<i>- Oh, shh, shh, shh.</i>

1218
01:24:37,606 --> 01:24:41,304
<i>- So you think Batman's made
Gotham a better place? Hm?</i>

1219
01:24:41,775 --> 01:24:43,397
<i>- Look at me.</i>

1220
01:24:43,572 --> 01:24:45,281
<i>- Look at me!</i>

1221
01:24:49,259 --> 01:24:52,818
<i>- You see, this is how crazy
Batman's made Gotham.</i>

1222
01:24:52,993 --> 01:24:55,121
<i>- You want order in Gotham -</i>

1223
01:24:55,296 --> 01:24:59,517
<i>Batman must take off his
mask and turn himself in.</i>

1224
01:24:59,692 --> 01:25:03,599
<i>- Oh, and every day he
doesn't, people will die.</i>

1225
01:25:03,774 --> 01:25:05,692
<i>- Starting tonight.</i>

1226
01:25:05,867 --> 01:25:07,211
<i>- I'm a man of my word.</i>

1227
01:25:07,386 --> 01:25:10,821
So who is Joker?

1228
01:25:11,450 --> 01:25:16,631
<i>- If we're gonna play games...</i>
Which is the lie he is opposing?

1229
01:25:17,416 --> 01:25:19,667
<i>- ...I'm gonna need</i>
<i>a cup of coffee.</i>

1230
01:25:19,842 --> 01:25:24,063
<i>- Ah, the 'good cop,</i>
<i>bad cop' routine?</i>

1231
01:25:24,238 --> 01:25:25,738
<i>- Not exactly.</i>

1232
01:25:25,913 --> 01:25:30,867
The truly disturbing thing
about The Dark Knight -

1233
01:25:31,042 --> 01:25:39,293
is that it elevates lie into
a general social principal, -

1234
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:41,648
into the principal
of organisation -

1235
01:25:41,823 --> 01:25:43,741
of our social political life.

1236
01:25:43,916 --> 01:25:47,928
As if our societies
can remain stable, -

1237
01:25:48,103 --> 01:25:50,650
can function, only
if based on a lie.

1238
01:25:50,825 --> 01:25:53,685
As if telling the truth,
and this telling the truth -

1239
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:58,710
embodies in Joker
means distraction.

1240
01:25:58,885 --> 01:26:00,751
Disintegration of
the social order.

1241
01:26:00,926 --> 01:26:02,111
<i>- Never start with the head.</i>

1242
01:26:02,286 --> 01:26:03,810
<i>- The victim gets all fuzzy.</i>

1243
01:26:03,985 --> 01:26:05,618
<i>- He can't feel the next...</i>

1244
01:26:05,793 --> 01:26:09,229
Toward the end it is
as if lie functions -

1245
01:26:09,404 --> 01:26:12,160
as a hot potato passing from -

1246
01:26:12,335 --> 01:26:14,777
one person's hand to
another person's hand.

1247
01:26:14,952 --> 01:26:17,394
First there is Harvey Dent.

1248
01:26:18,807 --> 01:26:20,481
<i>- So be it. Take the Batman</i>
<i>into custody...</i>

1249
01:26:20,656 --> 01:26:23,622
The public prosecutor
who lies.

1250
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:27,024
<i>- I am the Batman.</i>
Claiming that he is the real -

1251
01:26:27,199 --> 01:26:31,629
person behind Batman's mask.
That he is Batman.

1252
01:26:32,833 --> 01:26:34,299
Then we have Gordon, -

1253
01:26:34,474 --> 01:26:37,125
honest policeman,
Batman's friend, who -

1254
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:41,469
fakes, stages his
own death.

1255
01:26:48,639 --> 01:26:52,040
<i>- Five dead.</i>
<i>Two of them cops.</i>

1256
01:26:52,215 --> 01:26:53,820
<i>- You can't sweep that off.</i>

1257
01:26:53,995 --> 01:26:59,263
At the end, Batman himself
takes upon himself -

1258
01:26:59,438 --> 01:27:02,298
<i>- But the Joker cannot win.</i>
the crimes, murders committed -

1259
01:27:02,473 --> 01:27:06,695
by Harvey Dent, the public
prosecutor turned criminal -

1260
01:27:06,870 --> 01:27:09,887
<i>- Gotham needs</i>
<i>its true hero.</i>

1261
01:27:10,830 --> 01:27:15,731
in order to maintain
the trust of the public -

1262
01:27:15,906 --> 01:27:18,104
into the legal system.

1263
01:27:18,279 --> 01:27:21,454
The idea is if the ordinary
public were to learn -

1264
01:27:21,629 --> 01:27:25,309
how corrupt was or
is the very core of our -

1265
01:27:25,484 --> 01:27:28,624
legal system then everything
would have collapsed -

1266
01:27:28,799 --> 01:27:32,549
so we need a lie
to maintain order.

1267
01:27:32,724 --> 01:27:34,329
<i>- A hero.</i>

1268
01:27:34,504 --> 01:27:38,149
<i>- Not the hero we deserved,</i>
<i>but the hero we needed.</i>

1269
01:27:38,324 --> 01:27:42,179
<i>- Nothing less than</i>
<i>a knight, shining.</i>

1270
01:27:42,354 --> 01:27:43,854
There's nothing new in this.

1271
01:27:44,029 --> 01:27:47,046
This is an old
conservative wisdom -

1272
01:27:47,221 --> 01:27:51,338
asserted long ago by
philosophers from Plato -

1273
01:27:51,513 --> 01:27:54,059
especially, and then
Immanuel Kant,

1274
01:27:54,234 --> 01:27:55,996
Edmond Burke and
so on and so on.

1275
01:27:56,171 --> 01:27:59,555
This idea that the truth
is too strong.

1276
01:27:59,730 --> 01:28:03,428
That a politician should
be a cynicist who, -

1277
01:28:03,603 --> 01:28:07,039
although he
knows what is true,

1278
01:28:07,214 --> 01:28:11,749
tells to ordinary people what
Plato called 'a noble fable' -

1279
01:28:11,924 --> 01:28:13,058
a lie.

1280
01:28:13,233 --> 01:28:17,977
<i>- Um, the United States</i>
<i>knows that Iraq -</i>

1281
01:28:18,152 --> 01:28:20,803
<i>has weapons of</i>
<i>mass destruction. </i>

1282
01:28:20,978 --> 01:28:22,740
<i>- The U.K. knows</i>
<i>that they have -</i>

1283
01:28:22,915 --> 01:28:24,048
<i>weapons of mass destruction.</i>

1284
01:28:24,223 --> 01:28:25,985
<i>- Any country on</i>
<i>the face of the earth -</i>

1285
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:27,869
<i>with an active</i>
<i>intelligence program -</i>

1286
01:28:28,044 --> 01:28:31,271
<i>knows that Iraq has weapons</i>
<i>of mass destruction.</i>

1287
01:28:31,446 --> 01:28:34,568
<i>- Which could be activated</i>
<i>within forty five minutes -</i>

1288
01:28:34,743 --> 01:28:37,185
<i>including against his</i>
<i>own Shia population.</i>

1289
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:40,587
<i>The choice is his and</i>
<i>if he does not disarm -</i>

1290
01:28:40,762 --> 01:28:44,407
<i>the United States of America</i>
<i>will lead a coalition -</i>

1291
01:28:44,582 --> 01:28:47,338
<i>and disarm him</i>
<i>in the name of peace.</i>

1292
01:28:47,757 --> 01:28:50,897
Let's be frank.
We can have a state -

1293
01:28:51,072 --> 01:28:53,304
public system of power -

1294
01:28:53,479 --> 01:28:57,230
as legitimate as you want
submitted to critical press, -

1295
01:28:57,405 --> 01:29:00,161
democratic elections and
so on and so on, -

1296
01:29:00,336 --> 01:29:03,824
apparently just
serves us.

1297
01:29:03,999 --> 01:29:06,912
But nonetheless, if you
look closely into -

1298
01:29:07,087 --> 01:29:12,774
how even the most democratic
state power functions -

1299
01:29:12,949 --> 01:29:16,123
in order for it to display
true authority, -

1300
01:29:16,298 --> 01:29:19,787
and power needs authority,
there has to be, as it were, -

1301
01:29:19,962 --> 01:29:24,916
between the lines all the
time this message of:

1302
01:29:25,091 --> 01:29:27,951
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, we are
legalised through elections" -

1303
01:29:28,126 --> 01:29:32,191
"but basically we can do with
you whatever we want."

1304
01:29:32,976 --> 01:29:35,592
<i>- Because that's what</i>
<i>needs to happen. </i>

1305
01:29:36,377 --> 01:29:39,989
<i>- Because sometimes,</i>
<i>truth isn't good enough. </i>

1306
01:29:41,192 --> 01:29:43,548
<i>- Sometimes people</i>
<i>deserve more. </i>

1307
01:29:46,635 --> 01:29:48,415
<i>- Sometimes people</i>
<i>deserve -</i>

1308
01:29:48,590 --> 01:29:50,404
<i>to have their</i>
<i>faith rewarded. </i>

1309
01:29:50,579 --> 01:29:52,654
One of the
great platitudes -

1310
01:29:52,829 --> 01:29:54,015
which are popular today -

1311
01:29:54,190 --> 01:29:58,916
when we are confronted
with acts of violence -

1312
01:29:59,091 --> 01:30:03,279
is to refer to Theodore
Dostoïevsky's -

1313
01:30:03,454 --> 01:30:06,366
famous statement from
'The Brothers Karamazov':

1314
01:30:06,541 --> 01:30:10,710
"If there is no God then
everything id permitted."

1315
01:30:10,885 --> 01:30:13,867
Well, the first problem with
this statement is that -

1316
01:30:14,042 --> 01:30:17,217
Dostoïevsky, of crouse,
never made it.

1317
01:30:17,696 --> 01:30:20,514
he first one who used
this phrase as -

1318
01:30:20,689 --> 01:30:22,747
allegedly made by
Dostoïevsky was -

1319
01:30:22,922 --> 01:30:24,980
Jean-Paul Sartre in -43 -

1320
01:30:25,155 --> 01:30:28,809
but the main
point is that this -

1321
01:30:28,984 --> 01:30:31,946
statement is simply wrong.

1322
01:30:32,121 --> 01:30:35,456
Even a brief look at our
predicament today -

1323
01:30:35,631 --> 01:30:37,742
clearly tells us this.

1324
01:30:41,305 --> 01:30:43,060
It is precisely:

1325
01:30:43,235 --> 01:30:48,058
if there is God, that
everything is permitted -

1326
01:30:48,233 --> 01:30:51,036
to those who not
only believe in God -

1327
01:30:51,211 --> 01:30:54,545
but who perceive
themselves as instruments, -

1328
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:57,736
direct instruments
of the divine will.

1329
01:30:59,278 --> 01:31:03,000
If you posit or perceive
or legitimise yourself -

1330
01:31:03,175 --> 01:31:05,765
as a direct instrument
of the divine will -

1331
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:10,657
then of course all narrow
petty moral considerations -

1332
01:31:10,832 --> 01:31:13,156
disappear.

1333
01:31:15,602 --> 01:31:18,261
How can you even think
in such narrow terms -

1334
01:31:18,436 --> 01:31:22,674
when you are a direct
instrument of God?

1335
01:31:23,046 --> 01:31:26,609
This is how so-called religious
fundamentalists work, -

1336
01:31:26,784 --> 01:31:28,683
but not only them.

1337
01:31:28,858 --> 01:31:32,724
Every form of so called
totalitarianism -

1338
01:31:32,899 --> 01:31:36,553
works like that even
if it is presented -

1339
01:31:36,728 --> 01:31:40,381
or if it presents
itself as atheist.

1340
01:31:40,556 --> 01:31:42,083
Let's take Stalinism.

1341
01:31:42,258 --> 01:31:47,932
Officially Stalinism was based
on atheist Marxist theory, -

1342
01:31:48,107 --> 01:31:52,877
but if we look closely at
the subjective experience -

1343
01:31:53,052 --> 01:31:57,450
of a Stalinist
political agent, -

1344
01:31:57,625 --> 01:31:59,562
leader, we see that -

1345
01:31:59,737 --> 01:32:02,236
it's not a position of
an arrogant master, -

1346
01:32:02,411 --> 01:32:04,097
who can do
whatever he wants.

1347
01:32:04,272 --> 01:32:08,244
It's on the contrary the
position of a perfect servant.

1348
01:32:08,419 --> 01:32:12,339
In a Stalinist universe
there definitely is -

1349
01:32:12,514 --> 01:32:16,380
what in psychoanalytic theory
we call the 'Big Other'.

1350
01:33:25,346 --> 01:33:28,271
This 'Big Other' in the
Stalinist universe -

1351
01:33:28,446 --> 01:33:30,558
has many names.

1352
01:33:32,100 --> 01:33:34,599
The best known of them
are the necessity of -

1353
01:33:34,774 --> 01:33:37,257
historical progress
towards communism -

1354
01:33:37,432 --> 01:33:39,916
simply history.

1355
01:33:40,091 --> 01:33:41,884
History itself is the 'Big Other'.

1356
01:33:42,059 --> 01:33:46,510
History as the necessary
succession of historical stages.

1357
01:34:09,747 --> 01:34:13,044
A communist experiences
himself as simply -

1358
01:34:13,219 --> 01:34:17,138
an instrument whose
function is to actualise -

1359
01:34:17,313 --> 01:34:19,637
a historical necessity.

1360
01:34:23,944 --> 01:34:26,550
The people, the
mythic people -

1361
01:34:26,725 --> 01:34:30,591
whose instrument the
totalitarian leader is -

1362
01:34:30,766 --> 01:34:35,589
are never simply the actually
existing individuals -

1363
01:34:35,764 --> 01:34:37,291
groups of people and so on.

1364
01:34:37,466 --> 01:34:42,076
It's some kind of imagined
idealised point of reference -

1365
01:34:42,251 --> 01:34:46,490
which works even when,
for example in -

1366
01:34:46,665 --> 01:34:49,362
rebellions against
the communist rule, -

1367
01:34:49,537 --> 01:34:51,329
like in Hungary -56, -

1368
01:34:51,504 --> 01:34:55,795
when the large majority
of actually resisting people -

1369
01:34:55,970 --> 01:34:59,305
raises up, is opposed
to the regime.

1370
01:34:59,837 --> 01:35:03,293
They can still say: "no,
these are just individuals" -

1371
01:35:03,468 --> 01:35:06,058
"they are not
the true people."

1372
01:35:06,377 --> 01:35:07,813
When you are accused
of: "My God" -

1373
01:35:07,988 --> 01:35:10,099
"How could you have been doing
all of these horrible things?"

1374
01:35:10,274 --> 01:35:12,014
You could have said,
and this is the -

1375
01:35:12,189 --> 01:35:14,300
standard Stalinist excuse:

1376
01:35:14,475 --> 01:35:17,544
"Of course my heart bleeds
for all the poor victims, -

1377
01:35:17,719 --> 01:35:20,468
"I am not fully
responsible for it" -

1378
01:35:20,643 --> 01:35:24,403
"I was only acting on
behalf of the 'Big Other'".

1379
01:35:31,103 --> 01:35:33,975
"As for myself, I like cats,"

1380
01:35:34,150 --> 01:35:35,570
"small children",
whatever -

1381
01:35:35,745 --> 01:35:37,856
this is always part
of the iconography of -

1382
01:35:38,031 --> 01:35:39,824
a Stalinist leader.

1383
01:35:40,887 --> 01:35:43,758
Lenin in Stalinism is
always presented as -

1384
01:35:43,933 --> 01:35:47,428
someone who likes small
children and cats.

1385
01:35:47,603 --> 01:35:48,603
The implication being -

1386
01:35:48,778 --> 01:35:51,894
Lenin had to order many
killings and so on, but -

1387
01:35:52,069 --> 01:35:53,489
but his heart
was not there -

1388
01:35:53,664 --> 01:35:55,829
this was his duty
as instrument of -

1389
01:35:56,004 --> 01:35:59,019
historical progress and
so on and so on.

1390
01:36:00,136 --> 01:36:02,742
The way to undermine
Stalinism is not simply -

1391
01:36:02,917 --> 01:36:05,241
to make fun of the
leader which can be, -

1392
01:36:05,416 --> 01:36:07,846
up to a point
even tolerated.

1393
01:36:08,021 --> 01:36:11,409
It is to undermine
this very reference, -

1394
01:36:11,584 --> 01:36:15,329
mythic reference which
legitimises the Stalinist leader:

1395
01:36:15,833 --> 01:36:16,886
the people.

1396
01:36:37,198 --> 01:36:39,485
This is how I read -

1397
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:43,632
the by far best work
of Milos Forman -

1398
01:36:43,807 --> 01:36:46,982
his early Czech films.

1399
01:36:59,425 --> 01:37:02,084
'Black Peter', the 'Loves
of a Blond' -

1400
01:37:02,259 --> 01:37:05,168
and 'Firemen's Ball'
where he mocks -

1401
01:37:05,343 --> 01:37:08,465
precisely the
ordinary people.

1402
01:37:10,964 --> 01:37:13,091
In their daily
conformission, -

1403
01:37:13,266 --> 01:37:16,122
stupidity, egotistic lust -

1404
01:37:16,297 --> 01:37:18,249
and so on and so on.

1405
01:37:28,405 --> 01:37:31,648
It may appear that this is
something very arrogant -

1406
01:37:31,823 --> 01:37:34,573
but no, I think that
this is the way to -

1407
01:37:34,748 --> 01:37:38,455
undermine the entire structure
of the Stalinist universe.

1408
01:37:38,630 --> 01:37:41,645
To demonstrate not that
leaders are not leaders, -

1409
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:43,241
they are always ready to say:
Oh, but we are just" -

1410
01:37:43,416 --> 01:37:44,783
"ordinary people like you."

1411
01:37:44,958 --> 01:37:48,558
No! That there is no
mythic people -

1412
01:37:48,733 --> 01:37:52,705
which serves as the
ultimate legitimisation.

1413
01:38:02,755 --> 01:38:05,095
So what is the 'Big Other'?

1414
01:38:05,270 --> 01:38:10,572
This basic element of
every ideological edifice?

1415
01:38:10,747 --> 01:38:14,560
It has two quite
contradictory aspects.

1416
01:38:14,735 --> 01:38:16,208
On the one hand,
of course, -

1417
01:38:16,383 --> 01:38:20,143
the 'Big Other' is the secret
order of things like -

1418
01:38:20,318 --> 01:38:23,440
divine reason, fate
or whatever, -

1419
01:38:23,615 --> 01:38:26,099
which is controlling
our destiny.

1420
01:38:26,274 --> 01:38:28,545
But it is maybe the least
interesting aspect -

1421
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:30,178
of the 'Big Other' -

1422
01:38:30,353 --> 01:38:32,426
as the agents, which
guarantees meaning -

1423
01:38:32,601 --> 01:38:33,809
of what we are doing.

1424
01:38:35,138 --> 01:38:37,478
Much more interesting
is the 'Big Other' -

1425
01:38:37,653 --> 01:38:40,987
as the order of appearances.

1426
01:38:42,742 --> 01:38:45,241
Many things which
are prohibited -

1427
01:38:45,416 --> 01:38:47,581
are not simply
prohibited but -

1428
01:38:47,756 --> 01:38:51,728
they should not happen
for the 'Big Other'.

1429
01:38:53,430 --> 01:38:56,035
A supreme
example of this -

1430
01:38:56,210 --> 01:38:59,864
agency of the 'Big Other'
as the agency of -

1431
01:39:00,039 --> 01:39:04,862
appearance is the
prattling busybody -

1432
01:39:05,037 --> 01:39:09,967
in David Lean's masterpiece,
the 'Brief Encounter'.

1433
01:39:10,142 --> 01:39:11,988
At the very beginning
of the film, -

1434
01:39:12,163 --> 01:39:15,337
the two lovers, Celia Johnson
and Trevor Howard, -

1435
01:39:15,512 --> 01:39:18,528
arrange for their last
meeting in a cafeteria -

1436
01:39:18,703 --> 01:39:20,389
of a small train station.

1437
01:39:20,564 --> 01:39:22,250
<i>- Laura, what a lovely surprise.</i>

1438
01:39:22,425 --> 01:39:23,425
<i>- Oh, Dolly.</i>

1439
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:25,228
<i>- My dear, I've been shopping</i>
<i>till I'm dropping.</i>

1440
01:39:25,403 --> 01:39:27,195
<i>- My feet are nearly off,</i>
<i>and my throat's parched.</i>

1441
01:39:27,370 --> 01:39:28,685
<i>- l thought of having</i>
<i>tea in Spindle's -</i>

1442
01:39:28,860 --> 01:39:30,333
<i>but l was terrified</i>
<i>of losing the train.</i>

1443
01:39:30,508 --> 01:39:33,364
<i>- Oh, dear.</i>
<i>- This is Dr. Harvey.</i>

1444
01:39:33,539 --> 01:39:35,278
<i>- How do you do?</i>
<i>- Would you be a perfect dear -</i>

1445
01:39:35,453 --> 01:39:36,873
<i>and get me my cup of tea?</i>
<i>l really don't think l could</i>

1446
01:39:37,048 --> 01:39:38,357
<i>drag my poor old bones</i>
<i>over to the counter.</i>

1447
01:39:38,532 --> 01:39:40,914
Why is this situation
so interesting?

1448
01:39:41,089 --> 01:39:45,647
Because on the one hand we
cannot but experience -

1449
01:39:45,822 --> 01:39:49,635
this annoying lady as
a brutal intruder.

1450
01:39:49,810 --> 01:39:51,124
<i>- There's your train.</i>
<i>- Yes, l know.</i>

1451
01:39:51,299 --> 01:39:52,347
<i>- Oh, aren't you coming</i>
<i>with us?</i>

1452
01:39:52,522 --> 01:39:53,729
<i>- No, l go in the opposite</i>
<i>direction.</i>

1453
01:39:53,904 --> 01:39:55,218
<i>- My practice is in Churley.</i>
<i>- Oh, I see.</i>

1454
01:39:55,393 --> 01:39:56,813
<i>- I'm a general practitioner</i>
<i>at the moment.</i>

1455
01:39:56,988 --> 01:39:58,462
<i>- Dr. Harvey's going out</i>
<i>to Africa next week.</i>

1456
01:39:58,637 --> 01:39:59,791
<i>- Oh, how thrilling.</i>

1457
01:39:59,966 --> 01:40:03,992
Instead of the two lovers
being allowed at least their -

1458
01:40:04,167 --> 01:40:06,066
final moments alone -

1459
01:40:06,241 --> 01:40:08,246
they have to maintain
the appearances -

1460
01:40:08,421 --> 01:40:10,426
that nothing is happening
between them, -

1461
01:40:10,601 --> 01:40:13,085
that they are just acquaintances
and so on and so on.

1462
01:40:18,668 --> 01:40:20,423
<i>-  He'll have to run,</i>
<i>or he'll miss it.</i>

1463
01:40:20,598 --> 01:40:22,550
<i>- He's got to get right over</i>
<i>to the other platform.</i>

1464
01:40:23,081 --> 01:40:26,272
This precisely is the function
of the 'Big Other'.

1465
01:40:26,447 --> 01:40:30,260
We need for our stability,
a figure of 'Big Other' -

1466
01:40:30,435 --> 01:40:33,504
for whom we maintain
appearances.

1467
01:40:33,679 --> 01:40:35,508
<i>- And l arrived at the station</i>
<i>with exactly half -</i>

1468
01:40:35,683 --> 01:40:38,449
<i>a minute to spare.
My dear, l flew.</i>

1469
01:40:38,624 --> 01:40:41,958
But are things really
as simple as that?

1470
01:40:42,133 --> 01:40:44,245
The next scene, the
scene of Celia Johnson -

1471
01:40:44,420 --> 01:40:47,169
totally desperate, she knows
she will never again -

1472
01:40:47,344 --> 01:40:48,765
see her lover.

1473
01:40:48,940 --> 01:40:50,413
<i>- Yes, he's a nice creature.</i>

1474
01:40:50,588 --> 01:40:53,922
<i>- You known him long?</i>
<i>- No, not very long.</i>

1475
01:40:54,507 --> 01:40:55,715
<i>- l hardly know him</i>
<i>at all, really.</i>

1476
01:40:55,890 --> 01:40:58,533
<i>- Well, my dear, I've always</i>
<i>had a passion for doctors.</i>

1477
01:40:58,708 --> 01:41:02,643
Then we hear the line of
Celia Johnson's thought.

1478
01:41:03,068 --> 01:41:05,621
<i>- I wish I could trust you.</i>

1479
01:41:06,046 --> 01:41:08,864
<i>- I wish you were</i>
<i>a wise, kind friend -</i>

1480
01:41:09,039 --> 01:41:10,710
<i>instead of a gossiping</i>
<i>acquaintance I've known -</i>

1481
01:41:10,885 --> 01:41:13,437
<i>casually for years and never</i>
<i>particularly cared for.</i>

1482
01:41:13,612 --> 01:41:16,628
What is the nature of this
deadlock of Celia Johnson?

1483
01:41:16,803 --> 01:41:19,978
She is split between
the two figures -

1484
01:41:20,153 --> 01:41:22,902
in the film
of the Big Other.

1485
01:41:23,434 --> 01:41:26,039
On the one hand
it's her husband, -

1486
01:41:26,214 --> 01:41:28,857
the ideal listener, but -

1487
01:41:29,032 --> 01:41:32,314
it's out of question
to confess to him.

1488
01:41:40,715 --> 01:41:42,310
<i>- Fred.</i>

1489
01:41:42,736 --> 01:41:44,597
<i>- Fred.</i>

1490
01:41:45,341 --> 01:41:46,937
<i>- Dear Fred.</i>

1491
01:41:47,734 --> 01:41:50,287
<i>- There's so much that</i>
<i>I want to say to you.</i>

1492
01:41:51,031 --> 01:41:53,105
<i>- You're the only one in the</i>
<i>world with enough wisdom -</i>

1493
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,966
<i>and gentleness</i>
<i>to understand.</i>

1494
01:41:56,029 --> 01:41:58,263
<i>- Wild horses wouldn't drag </i>
<i>me away from England -</i>

1495
01:41:58,438 --> 01:42:00,071
<i>and home and all the</i>
<i>things I'm used to.</i>

1496
01:42:00,246 --> 01:42:02,783
<i>- l mean, one has one's roots</i>
<i>after all, hasn't one?</i>

1497
01:42:02,958 --> 01:42:04,591
<i>- Oh, yes, one has</i>
<i>one's roots.</i>

1498
01:42:04,962 --> 01:42:08,206
On the other hand you
have here this stupid -

1499
01:42:08,381 --> 01:42:11,184
person who is available
as a confessor -

1500
01:42:11,359 --> 01:42:14,853
but there is not even
an elementary trust.

1501
01:42:15,028 --> 01:42:17,246
<i>- I wish you'd stop talking.</i>

1502
01:42:17,421 --> 01:42:20,436
<i>- I wish you'd stop prying and</i>
<i>trying to find things out.</i>

1503
01:42:20,611 --> 01:42:22,297
<i>- I wish you were dead.</i>
<i>No, l don't mean that.</i>

1504
01:42:22,472 --> 01:42:24,850
<i>- That was silIy and unkind -</i>

1505
01:42:25,232 --> 01:42:27,721
<i>but l wish you'd stop talking.</i>
<i>- My dear, all her hair -</i>

1506
01:42:27,896 --> 01:42:30,060
<i> came out, and she said the</i>
<i>social life was quite, -</i>

1507
01:42:30,235 --> 01:42:32,772
<i>quite horrid. Provincial, you know,</i>
<i>and very nouveau riche.</i>

1508
01:42:32,947 --> 01:42:34,102
<i>- Oh, Dolly.</i>
<i>- What's the matter, dear?</i>

1509
01:42:34,277 --> 01:42:35,596
<i>Are you feeling ill again?</i>

1510
01:42:35,771 --> 01:42:37,824
So that's the tragedy
of our predicament.

1511
01:42:37,999 --> 01:42:41,014
In order to fully
exist as individuals -

1512
01:42:41,189 --> 01:42:44,099
we need the fiction
of a 'Big Other'.

1513
01:42:44,274 --> 01:42:48,512
There must be an agency
which, as it were, -

1514
01:42:48,687 --> 01:42:50,852
registers our predicament.

1515
01:42:51,027 --> 01:42:56,328
An agency where the truth of
ourselves will be inscribed, -

1516
01:42:56,503 --> 01:42:59,360
accepted. An agency
to which to confess.

1517
01:42:59,535 --> 01:43:02,603
But what if there is
no such agency?

1518
01:43:02,778 --> 01:43:08,559
This was the utmost despair
of many women raped -

1519
01:43:08,734 --> 01:43:10,898
in the post Yugoslav war -

1520
01:43:11,073 --> 01:43:12,972
in Bosnia in
the early nineties.

1521
01:43:13,147 --> 01:43:16,588
They survived their
terrible predicament -

1522
01:43:16,763 --> 01:43:19,938
and what kept them alive was
the idea I must survive -

1523
01:43:20,113 --> 01:43:21,533
to tell the truth.

1524
01:43:21,708 --> 01:43:26,691
If when if they survived they
made a terrible discovery;

1525
01:43:26,866 --> 01:43:29,562
there is no one to
really listen to them.

1526
01:43:29,737 --> 01:43:32,381
Either some ignorant
bored social worker -

1527
01:43:32,556 --> 01:43:34,348
or some relative -

1528
01:43:34,523 --> 01:43:37,645
who usually made
obscene insinuations like -

1529
01:43:37,820 --> 01:43:39,559
are you sure you were not
enjoying a little bit -

1530
01:43:39,734 --> 01:43:41,053
the rape and so on
and so on.

1531
01:43:41,228 --> 01:43:44,611
They discovered
the truth of what -

1532
01:43:44,786 --> 01:43:48,386
Jacques Lacan claims:
there is no 'Big Other'.

1533
01:43:48,561 --> 01:43:51,417
There may be
a virtual 'Big Other' -

1534
01:43:51,592 --> 01:43:53,225
to whom you
cannot confess.

1535
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:56,734
There may be a 'Real Other' -

1536
01:43:56,909 --> 01:43:58,383
but it's never
the virtual one.

1537
01:43:58,558 --> 01:44:01,414
We are alone.

1538
01:44:18,163 --> 01:44:21,513
I think Kafka was right
when he said that -

1539
01:44:21,688 --> 01:44:26,140
for a modern secular
non-religious man -

1540
01:44:27,203 --> 01:44:31,404
bureaucracy, state bureaucracy
is the only remaining -

1541
01:44:31,579 --> 01:44:35,232
contact with the
dimension of the divine.

1542
01:44:39,273 --> 01:44:42,038
It is in this scene
from 'Brazil' -

1543
01:44:42,213 --> 01:44:44,272
that we see
the intimate link -

1544
01:44:44,447 --> 01:44:47,675
between bureaucracy
and enjoyment.

1545
01:44:48,472 --> 01:44:51,184
What the impenetrable
omnipotence of -

1546
01:44:51,359 --> 01:44:53,258
bureaucracy harbours -

1547
01:44:53,433 --> 01:44:55,332
is divine enjoyment.

1548
01:45:00,437 --> 01:45:02,404
<i>- My name's Lowry,</i>
<i>Mr. Warren, Sam Lowry.</i>

1549
01:45:02,617 --> 01:45:05,754
The intense rush of
bureaucratic engagement -

1550
01:45:05,929 --> 01:45:07,296
serves nothing.

1551
01:45:07,471 --> 01:45:09,269
<i>- Glad to have you on board.</i>

1552
01:45:11,231 --> 01:45:15,804
It is the performance of
it's very purposelessness -

1553
01:45:17,240 --> 01:45:19,739
that generates
an intense enjoyment -

1554
01:45:19,914 --> 01:45:23,514
ready to reproduce
itself forever.

1555
01:45:29,151 --> 01:45:30,799
<i>- Between you and</i>
<i>me, Lowry, this... no, no!</i>

1556
01:45:30,974 --> 01:45:32,713
<i>...departement... tell Records</i>
<i>to get stuffed!</i>

1557
01:45:32,888 --> 01:45:34,362
<i>...is about to be</i>
<i>upgraded and the..</i>

1558
01:45:34,537 --> 01:45:37,074
<i>- Ah!</i>

1559
01:45:37,249 --> 01:45:38,403
<i>- Here we are.</i>

1560
01:45:38,578 --> 01:45:41,381
<i>- Your very own number</i>
<i>on your very own door.</i>

1561
01:45:41,556 --> 01:45:44,252
<i>- And behind that door,</i>
<i>your very own office.</i>

1562
01:45:44,427 --> 01:45:47,549
<i>- Congratulations, DZ-015.</i>

1563
01:45:47,724 --> 01:45:49,303
<i>Welcome to the team.</i>

1564
01:45:49,478 --> 01:45:52,653
<i>- Yes. No. Cancel that.</i>
<i>Send to copies to Finance.</i>

1565
01:45:52,828 --> 01:45:55,578
The adverse of that is
a wonderful scene -

1566
01:45:55,753 --> 01:45:58,662
more towards the
beginning of the film.

1567
01:45:58,837 --> 01:46:00,736
<i>- Harry Tuttle, heating</i>
<i>engineer, at your service.</i>

1568
01:46:00,911 --> 01:46:03,394
The hero who has a problem
in his apartment -

1569
01:46:03,569 --> 01:46:08,234
with plumbing tries to get
the State agency to fix it.

1570
01:46:08,409 --> 01:46:10,520
<i>- Are you from</i>
<i>Central Services?</i>

1571
01:46:10,695 --> 01:46:13,498
Of course, two guys come,
they just want forms -

1572
01:46:13,673 --> 01:46:15,784
to fill in, they do nothing.

1573
01:46:15,959 --> 01:46:17,539
<i>- I called</i>
<i>Central Services.</i>

1574
01:46:17,714 --> 01:46:21,527
And then the ultimate
subversive figure comes;

1575
01:46:21,702 --> 01:46:25,621
a kind of clandestine plumber,
played by Robert Deniro, -

1576
01:46:25,796 --> 01:46:28,918
<i>- Just a minute. What was that</i>
<i>business with the gun?</i>

1577
01:46:29,093 --> 01:46:31,949
<i>- Just a precaution, sir.</i>
<i>Just a precaution.</i>

1578
01:46:32,124 --> 01:46:35,086
who tells him: "Just tell me
what is the problem" -

1579
01:46:35,261 --> 01:46:37,532
and promise quickly
to fix it.

1580
01:46:37,707 --> 01:46:42,318
This of course is the ultimate
offense to bureaucracy.

1581
01:46:42,493 --> 01:46:44,711
<i>- Are you telling me</i>
<i>this is illegal?</i>

1582
01:46:50,772 --> 01:46:52,102
<i>- Thanks.</i>

1583
01:46:52,277 --> 01:46:55,026
<i>- Listed kid, we're all in
it together.</i>

1584
01:46:55,201 --> 01:46:56,201
<i>- Go on.</i>

1585
01:46:56,376 --> 01:46:59,121
In the ordinary
theological universe -

1586
01:46:59,296 --> 01:47:01,886
your duty is imposed
onto you by God -

1587
01:47:02,061 --> 01:47:04,758
or society or another
higher authority, and -

1588
01:47:04,933 --> 01:47:07,575
your responsibility
is to do it.

1589
01:47:09,065 --> 01:47:12,095
But in a radically
atheist universe -

1590
01:47:12,270 --> 01:47:16,349
you are not only responsible
for doing your duty, -

1591
01:47:16,524 --> 01:47:20,816
you are also responsible
for deciding -

1592
01:47:20,991 --> 01:47:22,836
what is your duty.

1593
01:47:25,708 --> 01:47:28,952
There is always
in our subjectivity, -

1594
01:47:29,127 --> 01:47:31,557
in the way we
experience ourselves -

1595
01:47:31,732 --> 01:47:35,598
a minimum of hysteria.

1596
01:47:35,773 --> 01:47:39,001
Hysteria is what? Hysteria
is the way -

1597
01:47:39,176 --> 01:47:42,883
we question our social,
symbolic identity.

1598
01:47:43,058 --> 01:47:46,180
<i>- You're sure it's God? You're</i>
<i>sure it's not the devil?</i>

1599
01:47:46,552 --> 01:47:49,424
<i>- I'm not sure. I'm not</i>
<i>sure of anything.</i>

1600
01:47:49,599 --> 01:47:51,710
<i>- If it's the devil, the devil</i>
<i>can be cast out.</i>

1601
01:47:51,885 --> 01:47:53,518
<i>- But what if it's God?</i>

1602
01:47:53,693 --> 01:47:56,070
<i>- You can't cast out</i>
<i>God, can you?</i>

1603
01:47:56,708 --> 01:48:00,431
What is hysteria at
it's most elementary?

1604
01:48:00,803 --> 01:48:04,419
It's a question addressed
at the authority which -

1605
01:48:04,594 --> 01:48:06,758
which defines my identity.

1606
01:48:06,933 --> 01:48:12,554
It's: "Why am I what you are
telling me that I am?"

1607
01:48:13,139 --> 01:48:16,596
In psychoanalytic theory,
hysteria is much more -

1608
01:48:16,771 --> 01:48:18,722
subversive than perversion.

1609
01:48:18,897 --> 01:48:21,594
A pervert has no
uncertainties while again -

1610
01:48:21,769 --> 01:48:24,359
the hysterical position
is that of a doubt -

1611
01:48:24,534 --> 01:48:27,603
which is an extremely
productive position.

1612
01:48:27,778 --> 01:48:32,175
All new inventions come
from hysterical questioning -

1613
01:48:32,350 --> 01:48:36,163
and the unique character
of Christianity is that -

1614
01:48:36,338 --> 01:48:39,673
it transposes this
hysterical questioning -

1615
01:48:39,848 --> 01:48:43,555
onto God himself
as a subject.

1616
01:48:48,340 --> 01:48:51,477
<i>- Who's that? Who's following</i>
<i>me? Is that you? </i>

1617
01:48:53,551 --> 01:48:56,635
This is the ingenious
idea of -

1618
01:48:56,810 --> 01:48:59,719
'The Last Temptation of Christ' -

1619
01:49:03,017 --> 01:49:05,834
as Kazantzakis' novel and
Scorsese's film, -

1620
01:49:06,009 --> 01:49:09,557
namely the idea that
when Jesus Christ -

1621
01:49:09,732 --> 01:49:13,758
in his youth is told
that he is -

1622
01:49:13,933 --> 01:49:17,958
not only the Son of God,
but basically God himself, -

1623
01:49:18,133 --> 01:49:20,138
he doesn't simply accept it.

1624
01:49:20,313 --> 01:49:23,807
This is for Jesus Christ, boy, -

1625
01:49:23,982 --> 01:49:26,626
traumatic news like, my God,
why am I dead?

1626
01:49:26,801 --> 01:49:28,327
Am I really dead?

1627
01:49:31,464 --> 01:49:34,070
How did we come to
that unique point, -

1628
01:49:34,245 --> 01:49:38,430
which I think, makes
Christianity an exception?

1629
01:49:39,653 --> 01:49:43,003
t all began with
the Book of Job -

1630
01:49:43,178 --> 01:49:46,672
as we all know things
turn out bad for Job.

1631
01:49:46,847 --> 01:49:48,108
He loses everything.

1632
01:49:48,283 --> 01:49:52,681
His house, his family, his
possessions and so on.

1633
01:49:53,053 --> 01:49:56,509
hree friends visit him
and each of them -

1634
01:49:56,684 --> 01:50:01,082
tries to justify
Job's misfortunes.

1635
01:50:01,561 --> 01:50:03,847
The greatness of Job is that -

1636
01:50:04,022 --> 01:50:08,739
he does not accept this
deeper meaning.

1637
01:50:10,069 --> 01:50:15,546
When, towards the end of the Book
of Job, God himself appears, -

1638
01:50:16,184 --> 01:50:19,427
God gives right to Job.

1639
01:50:19,602 --> 01:50:22,724
He says everything that the
theological friends -

1640
01:50:22,899 --> 01:50:25,223
were telling Job is false;

1641
01:50:25,398 --> 01:50:27,776
everything that job
was saying is true.

1642
01:50:27,951 --> 01:50:30,488
No meaning in catastrophes.

1643
01:50:32,827 --> 01:50:37,294
Here we have the first step
in the direction of -

1644
01:50:37,469 --> 01:50:40,856
delegitimizing suffering.

1645
01:50:43,462 --> 01:50:46,812
<i>- Father stay with me,</i>
<i>don't leave me.</i>

1646
01:50:51,012 --> 01:50:54,469
The contrast between
Judaism and Christianity -

1647
01:50:54,644 --> 01:50:59,946
is the contrast between
anxiety and love.

1648
01:51:04,891 --> 01:51:09,145
The idea is that the Jewish
God is the God of the -

1649
01:51:09,320 --> 01:51:13,771
abyss of the other's desire.
Terrible things happen, -

1650
01:51:13,946 --> 01:51:17,280
God is in charge
but we do not -

1651
01:51:17,455 --> 01:51:21,854
know what the 'Big Other',
God, wants from us.

1652
01:51:22,029 --> 01:51:25,523
What is the divine desire?

1653
01:51:27,862 --> 01:51:30,574
To designate this
traumatic experience -

1654
01:51:30,749 --> 01:51:34,775
Lacan used the Italian
phrase 'che voglio'?

1655
01:51:34,950 --> 01:51:37,859
"What do you want?"
This terrifying question:

1656
01:51:38,034 --> 01:51:40,624
but what do you
want from me?

1657
01:51:44,346 --> 01:51:48,334
The idea is that Judaism
persists in this -

1658
01:51:48,509 --> 01:51:52,269
anxiety, like God remains
this enigmatic -

1659
01:51:52,444 --> 01:51:54,236
terrifying other.

1660
01:51:54,411 --> 01:51:57,108
And then Christianity
resolves -

1661
01:51:57,283 --> 01:51:59,713
the tension through love.

1662
01:51:59,888 --> 01:52:03,154
By sacrificing his son,
God demonstrates -

1663
01:52:03,329 --> 01:52:05,084
that he loves us.

1664
01:52:05,259 --> 01:52:07,211
So it's a kind
of a imaginary, -

1665
01:52:07,386 --> 01:52:11,040
sentimental even
resolution of a situation -

1666
01:52:11,215 --> 01:52:14,177
of radical anxiety.

1667
01:52:33,532 --> 01:52:36,935
<i>- Father, forgive them.</i>

1668
01:52:37,110 --> 01:52:39,115
If this were to be the
case then Christianity -

1669
01:52:39,290 --> 01:52:42,678
would have been a kind of
ideological, reversal -

1670
01:52:42,853 --> 01:52:45,868
or pacification of the
deep, much more -

1671
01:52:46,043 --> 01:52:48,633
shattering Jewish insight.

1672
01:52:48,808 --> 01:52:51,877
but I think one can read
the Christian gesture -

1673
01:52:52,052 --> 01:52:54,961
in a much more radical way.

1674
01:52:56,716 --> 01:52:59,428
This is what the sequence
of crucifixion -

1675
01:52:59,603 --> 01:53:02,276
in Scorsese's film shows us.

1676
01:53:02,451 --> 01:53:06,438
What dies on the
cross is precisely -

1677
01:53:06,613 --> 01:53:09,456
this guarantee
of the 'Big Other'.

1678
01:53:09,631 --> 01:53:13,930
The message of Christianity
is here radically atheist.

1679
01:53:14,105 --> 01:53:17,051
It's the death of Christ
is not any kind of -

1680
01:53:17,226 --> 01:53:19,965
redemption of commercial
affair in the sense of -

1681
01:53:20,140 --> 01:53:22,618
Christ suffers to
pay for our sins.

1682
01:53:22,793 --> 01:53:25,011
Pay to whom?
For what? And so on.

1683
01:53:25,186 --> 01:53:29,173
It's simply the disintegration
of the God which -

1684
01:53:29,348 --> 01:53:33,491
guarantees the meaning
of our lives.

1685
01:53:33,666 --> 01:53:36,093
And that's the meaning
of that famous phrase:

1686
01:53:36,268 --> 01:53:38,226
"Eli Eli lama sabachthani?"

1687
01:53:38,401 --> 01:53:41,868
"Father, why have you
forsaken me?"

1688
01:53:43,845 --> 01:53:50,140
<i>- Father, why have you</i>
<i>forsaken me?</i>

1689
01:53:57,943 --> 01:54:00,805
Just before Christ's
death, we get -

1690
01:54:00,980 --> 01:54:03,771
what in psychoanalytic
terms we call -

1691
01:54:03,946 --> 01:54:07,100
subjective destitution.

1692
01:54:08,349 --> 01:54:11,262
Stepping out totally of
the domain of -

1693
01:54:11,437 --> 01:54:14,176
symbolic identification

1694
01:54:15,580 --> 01:54:19,794
cancelling or suspending
the entire field -

1695
01:54:19,969 --> 01:54:21,563
of symbolic authority, -

1696
01:54:21,738 --> 01:54:24,893
the entire field
of the 'Big Other'.

1697
01:54:30,564 --> 01:54:32,749
Of course, we cannot know -

1698
01:54:32,924 --> 01:54:37,535
what God wants from us
because there is no God.

1699
01:54:42,426 --> 01:54:45,079
This is the Jesus Christ
who says, -

1700
01:54:45,254 --> 01:54:49,553
among other things,
"I bring to earth not peace."

1701
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:51,530
"If you don't hate your
father, your mother" -

1702
01:54:51,705 --> 01:54:53,247
"you are not my follower."

1703
01:54:53,422 --> 01:54:56,368
Of course this does not mean
that you should actively -

1704
01:54:56,543 --> 01:54:58,189
hate or kill your parents.

1705
01:54:58,364 --> 01:55:01,467
I think that family relations
stand here for -

1706
01:55:01,642 --> 01:55:04,485
hierarchic social relations.

1707
01:55:04,660 --> 01:55:06,617
The message of Christ is:

1708
01:55:06,792 --> 01:55:10,987
I'm dying but my death
itself is good news.

1709
01:55:11,162 --> 01:55:14,630
It means you are alone,
left to your freedom, -

1710
01:55:14,805 --> 01:55:17,439
be in the Holy Ghost, -

1711
01:55:17,959 --> 01:55:21,601
Holy Spirit, which is just
the community of believers.

1712
01:55:21,776 --> 01:55:23,474
It's wrong to think that -

1713
01:55:23,649 --> 01:55:28,052
the second coming will be
that Christ as a figure will -

1714
01:55:28,227 --> 01:55:30,029
return somehow.

1715
01:55:30,204 --> 01:55:33,099
Christ is already here when -

1716
01:55:33,274 --> 01:55:36,844
believers form an
emancipatory collective.

1717
01:55:37,019 --> 01:55:39,654
This is why I claim that -

1718
01:55:40,278 --> 01:55:43,712
that the only way really
to be an atheist -

1719
01:55:43,887 --> 01:55:46,729
is to go through Christianity.

1720
01:55:46,904 --> 01:55:50,527
Christianity is much
more atheist than -

1721
01:55:50,702 --> 01:55:54,221
the usual atheism which -

1722
01:55:54,396 --> 01:55:56,874
can claim there is no
God and so on -

1723
01:55:57,049 --> 01:56:00,308
but none the less
retains a certain trust -

1724
01:56:00,483 --> 01:56:03,117
into the 'Big Other', this
'Big Other' can be called -

1725
01:56:03,292 --> 01:56:06,187
natural necessity,
evolution or whatever.

1726
01:56:06,362 --> 01:56:10,453
We humans are none
the less reduced to a -

1727
01:56:11,025 --> 01:56:15,448
position within a harmonious
whole of evolution or whatever, -

1728
01:56:15,623 --> 01:56:18,569
but the difficult thing
to accept is again -

1729
01:56:18,744 --> 01:56:20,598
that there is no 'Big Other'.

1730
01:56:20,773 --> 01:56:26,165
No point of reference which
guarantees meaning.

1731
01:56:40,264 --> 01:56:45,154
We are in John
Frankenheimer's Seconds, -

1732
01:56:45,329 --> 01:56:49,264
a neglected Hollywood
masterpiece from 1966 -

1733
01:56:49,439 --> 01:56:52,334
from the very heart
of the hippy era -

1734
01:56:52,509 --> 01:56:55,507
which preached
unrestrained hedonism.

1735
01:56:55,682 --> 01:56:59,253
Realise your dreams,
enjoy life fully.

1736
01:56:59,428 --> 01:57:03,571
The film is the story of a late
middle age businessman -

1737
01:57:03,746 --> 01:57:07,005
leading a gray totally
alienated life -

1738
01:57:07,180 --> 01:57:09,710
and then he decides
at some point -

1739
01:57:09,885 --> 01:57:12,155
that he has enough of it.

1740
01:57:12,330 --> 01:57:15,589
Through one of his
friends he contacts -

1741
01:57:15,764 --> 01:57:18,971
a mysterious agency,
which offers him a deal.

1742
01:57:19,146 --> 01:57:22,196
They will reorganise
his life so that -

1743
01:57:22,371 --> 01:57:24,590
so that he will be reborn.

1744
01:57:32,290 --> 01:57:34,578
<i>- The cost runs in the</i>
<i>neighborhood of -</i>

1745
01:57:34,753 --> 01:57:36,660
<i>thirty thousand dollars.</i>
<i>I know this seems -</i>

1746
01:57:36,835 --> 01:57:39,833
<i>rather high but in</i>
<i>addition to the rather -</i>

1747
01:57:40,008 --> 01:57:43,111
<i>extensive cosmetic</i>
<i>renovation by way of -</i>

1748
01:57:43,286 --> 01:57:46,336
<i>plastic surgery for you,</i>
<i>CPS has to provide -</i>

1749
01:57:46,511 --> 01:57:49,146
<i>a fresh corpse that</i>
<i>perfectly matches your -</i>

1750
01:57:49,321 --> 01:57:52,423
<i>physical dimensions and</i>
<i>medical specifications.</i>

1751
01:57:52,598 --> 01:57:53,672
<i>- CPS?</i>

1752
01:57:53,847 --> 01:57:56,273
<i>- Oh, Cadaver</i>
<i>Procurement Section.</i>

1753
01:57:56,689 --> 01:58:01,424
They use some corpse; they
change it to look like -

1754
01:58:01,599 --> 01:58:05,846
his own body. They plant this
corpse, stage a pseudo accident -

1755
01:58:06,021 --> 01:58:08,395
so that police think he is dead.

1756
01:58:08,570 --> 01:58:10,476
<i>- Now, mister Wilson, you</i>
<i>represent something -</i>

1757
01:58:10,651 --> 01:58:12,713
<i>of a milestone around here.</i>

1758
01:58:14,118 --> 01:58:19,165
And then, the agency
organises an ultimate life -

1759
01:58:21,974 --> 01:58:25,044
in a nice villa somewhere
around L.A. -

1760
01:58:25,219 --> 01:58:28,997
they even organise a nice
lady who conveniently -

1761
01:58:29,172 --> 01:58:31,755
stumbles upon him when
he is taking a walk -

1762
01:58:31,930 --> 01:58:33,836
along the beach.

1763
01:58:36,073 --> 01:58:38,310
He is thus reborn...

1764
01:58:38,830 --> 01:58:41,275
no longer as a boring
business man but as a -

1765
01:58:41,450 --> 01:58:44,553
modernist painter -

1766
01:58:44,728 --> 01:58:45,783
<i>- Tony Wilson.</i>

1767
01:58:45,958 --> 01:58:47,726
called Tony Wilson -

1768
01:58:47,901 --> 01:58:52,721
played by none other
than Rock Hudson.

1769
01:58:56,987 --> 01:59:00,473
So, the woman, Nora,
his new love, -

1770
01:59:00,648 --> 01:59:04,011
tries to engage him in life,
even takes him to some -

1771
01:59:05,519 --> 01:59:08,016
wine orgy where
people get drunk, -

1772
01:59:08,191 --> 01:59:10,358
dance naked and so on.

1773
01:59:10,533 --> 01:59:13,011
Everything seems ok -

1774
01:59:15,092 --> 01:59:20,971
but Tony Wilson starts
to miss his old life.

1775
01:59:22,428 --> 01:59:27,110
More and more he is
haunted by his past.

1776
01:59:27,285 --> 01:59:29,711
Finally he breaks down, -

1777
01:59:29,886 --> 01:59:32,781
approaches again
the agency -

1778
01:59:32,956 --> 01:59:35,590
telling them that
he wants to return -

1779
01:59:35,765 --> 01:59:38,035
to his old life.

1780
01:59:40,533 --> 01:59:43,498
The boss of this
mysterious company, -

1781
01:59:43,673 --> 01:59:46,048
a kind of kindly cruel, -
<i>- Hello son.</i>

1782
01:59:46,223 --> 01:59:48,441
superego paternal figure -

1783
01:59:48,616 --> 01:59:50,626
tells him the truth.

1784
01:59:50,801 --> 01:59:53,799
He disappointed them
by not being able to -

1785
01:59:53,974 --> 01:59:56,765
adapt himself to
his new life.

1786
01:59:56,940 --> 01:59:59,314
<i>- You know, I sure hoped</i>
<i>you'd make it, -</i>

1787
01:59:59,489 --> 02:00:01,655
<i>find your dream come true.</i>

1788
02:00:01,830 --> 02:00:02,830
<i>- What?</i>

1789
02:00:03,005 --> 02:00:05,089
<i>- I said, I sure hoped</i>
<i>you'd make it -</i>

1790
02:00:05,264 --> 02:00:07,274
<i>find your dream come true.</i>

1791
02:00:07,449 --> 02:00:10,708
<i>- You can call it wishful</i>
<i>thinking, son -</i>

1792
02:00:10,883 --> 02:00:12,945
<i>but life is built on wishing.</i>

1793
02:00:13,120 --> 02:00:15,650
<i>- You've got to just keep</i>
<i>plugging away at them.</i>

1794
02:00:15,825 --> 02:00:17,887
<i>- You can't give up...</i>

1795
02:00:18,356 --> 02:00:22,465
<i>and you can't let the mistakes</i>
<i>jeopardize the dream.</i>

1796
02:00:22,640 --> 02:00:24,026
So what went wrong here?

1797
02:00:24,201 --> 02:00:26,627
The problem was
that his past -

1798
02:00:26,802 --> 02:00:29,801
in it's material
existence was erased.

1799
02:00:29,976 --> 02:00:31,674
<i>- Well, here's your</i>
<i>transportation.</i>

1800
02:00:31,849 --> 02:00:33,078
<i>- What?</i>
<i>- Surgery, sir.</i>

1801
02:00:33,253 --> 02:00:37,690
He lived in a totally new
environment, new job, -

1802
02:00:37,865 --> 02:00:39,634
new friends and so on.

1803
02:00:39,809 --> 02:00:43,536
What remained the same
were his dreams -

1804
02:00:43,711 --> 02:00:47,542
because when the company
organised his rebirth, -

1805
02:00:47,717 --> 02:00:51,132
when the company
provided a new existence -

1806
02:00:51,307 --> 02:00:54,617
for him they simply
followed his dreams.

1807
02:00:54,792 --> 02:00:57,999
His dreams were
wrong dreams -

1808
02:00:58,174 --> 02:01:02,681
and this is quite a deep lesson
for the theory of ideology.

1809
02:01:02,856 --> 02:01:04,502
<i>- Just remember, son. We've</i>
<i>got to keep plugging away -</i>

1810
02:01:04,677 --> 02:01:07,676
<i>at the dream. The mistakes teach</i>
<i>us how. It wasn't wasted.</i>

1811
02:01:07,851 --> 02:01:09,059
<i>Remember that.</i>

1812
02:01:09,234 --> 02:01:12,462
On the way to the operation
hall, he discovers -

1813
02:01:12,637 --> 02:01:14,543
the horrible truth.

1814
02:01:14,718 --> 02:01:19,902
He will not be reborn
but he will be used as a -

1815
02:01:20,077 --> 02:01:25,104
cadaver for another person
who wants to be reborn.

1816
02:01:29,025 --> 02:01:31,139
We should draw a line
of distinction -

1817
02:01:31,314 --> 02:01:34,001
within the very field
of our dreams.

1818
02:01:36,238 --> 02:01:39,307
Between those who
are the right dreams -

1819
02:01:39,482 --> 02:01:43,261
pointing towards a dimension
effectively beyond -

1820
02:01:43,436 --> 02:01:47,163
our existing society
and the wrong dreams:

1821
02:01:47,338 --> 02:01:50,025
the dreams which
are just an idealised -

1822
02:01:50,200 --> 02:01:53,563
consumerist reflection, -

1823
02:01:53,738 --> 02:01:56,892
mirror image of our society.

1824
02:01:59,285 --> 02:02:02,147
We are not simply
submitted to our dreams -

1825
02:02:02,322 --> 02:02:05,164
they just come from
some unfathomable -

1826
02:02:05,339 --> 02:02:08,442
depths and we can't
do anything about it.

1827
02:02:08,617 --> 02:02:11,511
This is the basic lesson
of psychoanalysis -

1828
02:02:11,686 --> 02:02:13,488
and fiction cinema.

1829
02:02:13,663 --> 02:02:16,714
We are responsible
for our dreams.

1830
02:02:16,889 --> 02:02:19,731
Our dreams stage
our desires -

1831
02:02:19,906 --> 02:02:23,321
and our desires are
not objective facts.

1832
02:02:23,496 --> 02:02:26,286
We created them,
we sustained them, -

1833
02:02:26,461 --> 02:02:28,680
we are responsible for them.

1834
02:02:28,855 --> 02:02:31,385
This is an area of ancient
lakebeds deposited -

1835
02:02:31,560 --> 02:02:33,778
five to ten million years ago.

1836
02:02:37,108 --> 02:02:40,802
The scene of mass orgy
in 'Zabriskie Point' -

1837
02:02:40,977 --> 02:02:43,975
is a nice metaphor
of what went wrong -

1838
02:02:44,150 --> 02:02:47,409
with the 1960s
hippy revolution.

1839
02:02:49,802 --> 02:02:54,796
It's crucial that 'Zabriskie Point'
was made in 1970 -

1840
02:02:54,971 --> 02:02:57,866
when the authentic
revolutionary energy -

1841
02:02:58,041 --> 02:03:03,069
of the sixties was already
losing its strength.

1842
02:03:04,369 --> 02:03:07,543
This orgy is somewhere
between subversion -

1843
02:03:07,718 --> 02:03:10,248
of the existing
social order -

1844
02:03:10,423 --> 02:03:13,838
and already the
full estheticised -

1845
02:03:14,013 --> 02:03:16,648
reincorporation
of this allegedly -

1846
02:03:16,823 --> 02:03:22,214
transgressive activities into
the hegemonic ideology.

1847
02:03:23,203 --> 02:03:26,012
Although Antonioni
meant this -

1848
02:03:26,187 --> 02:03:30,382
as a kind of transcendence
of the existing constraints, -

1849
02:03:30,557 --> 02:03:33,452
we can easily
imagine this shot -

1850
02:03:33,627 --> 02:03:36,730
in some publicity campaign.

1851
02:03:37,822 --> 02:03:40,839
The first step to freedom
is not just to -

1852
02:03:41,014 --> 02:03:44,117
change reality to
fit your dreams -

1853
02:03:44,292 --> 02:03:46,458
it's to change
the way you dream.

1854
02:03:46,633 --> 02:03:50,516
and again this hurts
because all satisfactions -

1855
02:03:50,691 --> 02:03:54,314
we have come from
our dreams.

1856
02:03:54,522 --> 02:03:56,759
<i>- The great supreme</i>
<i>commander chairman Mao -</i>

1857
02:03:56,934 --> 02:03:59,361
<i>issued a world shaking
call to us:</i>

1858
02:03:59,536 --> 02:04:02,170
<i>you should pay attention</i>
<i>to state affairs -</i>

1859
02:04:02,345 --> 02:04:05,291
<i>and carry the great proletarian</i>
<i>Cultural Revolution -</i>

1860
02:04:05,466 --> 02:04:07,008
<i>through to the end.</i>

1861
02:04:09,870 --> 02:04:12,263
One of the big problems
of all great -

1862
02:04:12,438 --> 02:04:16,217
revolutionary movements
of the 20th century -

1863
02:04:16,392 --> 02:04:19,338
such as Russia,
Cuba or China, -

1864
02:04:19,513 --> 02:04:22,824
is that they did change
the social body -

1865
02:04:25,269 --> 02:04:29,796
but the egalitarian communist
society was never realised.

1866
02:04:29,971 --> 02:04:32,813
The dreams remained
the old dreams -

1867
02:04:32,988 --> 02:04:36,767
and they turned into
the ultimate nightmare.

1868
02:04:37,652 --> 02:04:40,513
Now what remains of
the radical left -

1869
02:04:40,688 --> 02:04:42,958
waits for a magical event -

1870
02:04:43,133 --> 02:04:47,306
when the true revolutionary
agent will finally awaken.

1871
02:04:47,481 --> 02:04:51,422
While the depressing lesson of
the last decades is that -

1872
02:04:51,597 --> 02:04:55,553
capitalism has been the true
revolutionising force.

1873
02:04:55,728 --> 02:04:59,153
Even as it serves only itself.

1874
02:05:02,303 --> 02:05:07,568
How come it is easier for us to
imagine the end of all life on earth -

1875
02:05:07,743 --> 02:05:09,934
an asteroid hitting the planet -

1876
02:05:10,109 --> 02:05:14,408
than a modest change
in our economic order?

1877
02:05:14,583 --> 02:05:19,505
Perhaps the time has come
to set our possibilities straight -

1878
02:05:19,680 --> 02:05:23,522
and to become realists
by way of demanding -

1879
02:05:23,697 --> 02:05:28,318
what appears as impossible
in the economic domain.

1880
02:05:30,152 --> 02:05:34,536
The surprising explosion of
Occupy Wall Street protests -

1881
02:05:34,711 --> 02:05:37,437
the mass mobilisation in Greece -

1882
02:05:37,612 --> 02:05:39,997
the crowds on Tahrir square -

1883
02:05:40,172 --> 02:05:45,203
they all bear witness for the hidden
potential for a different future.

1884
02:05:45,378 --> 02:05:48,979
There is no guarantee that
this future will arrive.

1885
02:05:49,154 --> 02:05:53,096
No train of history on which
we simply have to take a ride.

1886
02:05:53,271 --> 02:05:57,949
It depends on us,
on our will.

1887
02:06:04,489 --> 02:06:08,737
In revolutionary
upheavals some energy -

1888
02:06:08,912 --> 02:06:13,751
or rather some utopian dreams
take place, they explode -

1889
02:06:13,926 --> 02:06:19,816
and even if the actual result
of a social upheaval is just a -

1890
02:06:19,991 --> 02:06:27,387
commercialised every day life,
this excess of energy, -

1891
02:06:27,562 --> 02:06:33,272
what gets lost in the result,
persists not in reality, but -

1892
02:06:33,447 --> 02:06:38,306
as a dream haunting us
waiting to be redeemed.

1893
02:06:38,481 --> 02:06:41,108
In this sense,
whenever we are engaged

1894
02:06:41,300 --> 02:06:43,795
in radical
emancipatory politics -

1895
02:06:43,970 --> 02:06:48,651
we should never forget
as Walter Benjamin put it -

1896
02:06:49,732 --> 02:06:50,732
almost a century ago -

1897
02:06:50,907 --> 02:06:55,836
that every revolution, if it is an
authentic revolution, -

1898
02:06:56,011 --> 02:06:59,127
is not only directed
towards the future -

1899
02:06:59,302 --> 02:07:05,310
but it redeems also
the past failed revolutions.

1900
02:07:05,485 --> 02:07:10,177
All the ghosts as it were; the living
dead of the past revolution -

1901
02:07:10,352 --> 02:07:14,821
which are roaming around,
unsatisfied will finally -

1902
02:07:14,996 --> 02:07:18,868
find their home
in the new freedom.

1903
02:07:19,656 --> 02:07:24,193

1904
02:10:06,760 --> 02:10:11,002
I may be freezing to death
but you'll never get rid of me.

1905
02:10:11,252 --> 02:10:16,208
All the ice in the world
cannot kill a true idea.

1906
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:20,058
