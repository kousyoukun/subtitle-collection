1
00:01:04,563 --> 00:01:06,631
That was a bomb.

2
00:01:10,669 --> 00:01:14,872
No word as to
whether it was an ied
or a specific car bomb.

3
00:01:15,474 --> 00:01:17,175
Over 10 fatalities reported.

4
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:22,113
Sources within isaf suggest
that isi may be involved.

5
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:26,784
Did these phones just
go down or did that
fucker hang up on me?

6
00:01:28,253 --> 00:01:32,390
Good thing that x was bodgy
or I'd be flying right now!

7
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,298
I can't hear you, honey.

8
00:01:40,632 --> 00:01:44,102
I need to talk to ed Faber.

9
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,839
Well, then who is
fronting the show?

10
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:48,840
I can't hear you!

11
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:52,376
Hey, that's my ass!
Do you have a mother?

12
00:02:02,855 --> 00:02:04,088
Hello!

13
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,423
Fu...

14
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:22,573
Listen up.
Iraq two is happening.

15
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:25,209
The network is
stretched thin. All our
talent is going there.

16
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:29,247
We need people, any
people, to fill the void
in Afghanistan.

17
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:32,450
And you folks here
are all the unmarried,

18
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:34,886
childless personnel
in this bureau.

19
00:02:39,491 --> 00:02:42,693
For those of you
who are behind
the scenes, there are

20
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:45,863
opportunities to be on camera.

21
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:49,200
Kim, are you going
to be joining in?

22
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:51,936
The travel or the crying?

23
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:54,972
Um, hopefully, the travel.

24
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:55,907
I'll think about it.

25
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:58,242
The success
of operation mongoose

26
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:01,012
has overshadowed
the real lesson
to be learned,

27
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,749
that the Taliban are
far from vanquished.

28
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:05,850
And as the drums of war

29
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:06,584
beat ever louder in Iraq,

30
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:12,490
the NATO mission
in Afghanistan grows
increasingly uncertain.

31
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,629
Tanya vanderpoel, outside
lashkar gah, Afghanistan,

32
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:21,132
vbc world news.

33
00:03:23,635 --> 00:03:25,136
Hey.

34
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:26,837
I got you! Hey.

35
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:29,440
Uh, when do you get
back from Houston?

36
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:31,609
I think on
Tuesday. Why?

37
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:35,780
Uh, because I'm going
to Afghanistan on Tuesday.

38
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:39,550
You're going
to Afghanistan on Tuesday?

39
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,284
Yeah.

40
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,553
But you write news copy.

41
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,754
Wait. For how long?

42
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:47,525
- Like, three months.
- What?

43
00:03:53,031 --> 00:03:54,532
Kim!

44
00:03:55,867 --> 00:03:57,335
Hey!

45
00:03:57,836 --> 00:04:00,571
I can't believe this worked out!

46
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:01,839
Hey, you want to have a quickie

47
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,741
on the changing table
in the bathroom?

48
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,376
Yeah, I don't think
i could get it up

49
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,378
with that little
koala looking at me.

50
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,914
Also, they're boarding already.

51
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,349
Hey, don't worry.
Just go. Go, go, go.

52
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:15,586
Oh, shoot, I...
I copied a key
for you, so...

53
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,187
Plants, mail.

54
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,956
Anything else
I'm forgetting?
I think that's it.

55
00:04:19,491 --> 00:04:20,224
This is crazy.

56
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,993
Listen, I think it's impressive.

57
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,327
Starting a new career?

58
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,929
It's gonna be great.

59
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,365
And listen, in three months...

60
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,033
"I'll be back."

61
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,234
No, that's terrible! No.

62
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:33,004
Don't remember
me like that. No.

63
00:04:33,805 --> 00:04:36,207
Bye. Okay. Okay.

64
00:04:38,443 --> 00:04:42,313
It's not my job.
I'm a producer.
General news. Enron.

65
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:43,948
These coalminers
in Pennsylvania,

66
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,416
but you probably
didn't see that.

67
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,151
'Cause we got two
wars going on now,

68
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:49,687
so, uh, I know how
to set up a bgan

69
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,222
and no one will sue if I die

70
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:55,359
so I got an expedited visa,
like, two days ago,

71
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:58,963
and I guess now
I'm a war reporter.

72
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,700
Shit dick!

73
00:05:03,702 --> 00:05:04,402
Corkscrew landing.

74
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:07,938
In case
a missile is fired
at the aircraft!

75
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:13,144
Kabul international airport.

76
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,147
K.I.A.! "Killed in
action."

77
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:20,484
Once again, we thank you
for flying with us.

78
00:05:30,796 --> 00:05:32,163
Sorry.

79
00:05:32,431 --> 00:05:33,998
Uh, sorry.

80
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:35,666
Shit.

81
00:05:38,236 --> 00:05:41,038
No, thank you.
No, thank you.

82
00:05:43,508 --> 00:05:45,142
Miss Baker?

83
00:05:45,677 --> 00:05:47,311
I am fahim.

84
00:05:47,412 --> 00:05:50,081
Oh, fahim, hi!
Pleased to meet you.

85
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,249
The car is over here and we go.

86
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,622
She says, uh...
"Welcome to Afghanistan."

87
00:05:58,924 --> 00:05:59,523
Okay, let's go.

88
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:02,493
Here is your local mobile.
The number is on the back.

89
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,029
Yeah, I ordered
some money last week.
Still in the post.

90
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,331
I'll fix you up next week.
Okay.

91
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,768
Yes, the air
here takes some
getting used to.

92
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,570
It's quite polluted with feces.

93
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,772
Ah, here she is!
How are you, Kim?

94
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,674
Welcome to the Stan.
My name's nic.

95
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:17,975
I'll be doing
your security.
I'll take your bag.

96
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:21,612
Fahim. The police are giving
me shit for parking here.

97
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:23,314
They just want money.

98
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,349
Wait, oh, no. Um,
do you need money?

99
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,118
Because the network
gave me money.

100
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,421
No, keep that on you!
No, no,
no! Kim, please!

101
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,763
Piss off, that's it!
That's it! Hey! Hey!

102
00:06:38,997 --> 00:06:41,866
- I'm sorry. Sorry.
- Piss off!

103
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:55,946
Remember that we
are at altitude here,

104
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:58,816
so drink plenty of water
while you acclimatize.

105
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,451
Where did you learn English?

106
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:03,287
At medical school.
I was a doctor.

107
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,855
Listen, rest up tonight.

108
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:08,392
Tomorrow, I'll drive you
to the base for your embed.

109
00:07:08,894 --> 00:07:09,460
And just one bag,

110
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,929
but make sure
you pack extra
socks and knickers.

111
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,666
That's like, um,
it's like "panties," yeah?

112
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:17,368
Mmm-hmm.

113
00:07:18,003 --> 00:07:20,037
So, you've been
embedded before, then?

114
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:23,340
Not really. We all did
hostile-zone training in 2001.

115
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:27,411
They taught us to
open our mouths
if we get mortared...

116
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:29,647
That kind of stuff.

117
00:07:29,848 --> 00:07:31,649
Okay.

118
00:07:41,026 --> 00:07:42,626
G'day, qadar.

119
00:07:54,206 --> 00:07:57,575
The feces smell
all the way to here.

120
00:08:03,882 --> 00:08:06,517
Your room, Kim, is upstairs.

121
00:08:11,423 --> 00:08:12,656
Yeah, they're bloody addicted.

122
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:15,359
That one melted a laptop
downloading porno.

123
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:16,861
Jaweed, yes,

124
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:19,730
he likes to watch
men with donkeys.

125
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,265
Hi.
Hi.

126
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,100
It's unfortunate.

127
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:25,302
Kim, this is tall Brian.

128
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:26,537
Brian hooper.
Tall Brian.

129
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:27,438
Hi.
I'm your shooter.

130
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,440
So, is there another Brian
around here

131
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,142
somewhere that
you're taller than?

132
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,345
Short Brian.
Works for reuters.

133
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,314
Couldn't one of
you just be "Brian"?

134
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:39,917
Fair enough.
Didn't think of that.

135
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,819
Also short Brian's dead.

136
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,989
- Oh, fuck. Really?
- Yes.

137
00:08:45,123 --> 00:08:48,726
Anyway, welcome
to the fun house.

138
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,701
Home sweet home.

139
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,371
This is your room.

140
00:09:02,374 --> 00:09:04,308
Is there a shower?

141
00:09:32,604 --> 00:09:34,471
A nation accustomed to war

142
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:37,641
once again seeks
a return to normality.

143
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:42,580
And nothing symbolizes that
effort more than this place,

144
00:09:43,014 --> 00:09:44,148
the Kabul zoo.

145
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,383
No, he didn't. The zoo?

146
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:47,885
Go back to wapping.

147
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,353
You fucking tourist!

148
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:53,290
Uh, shit. Sorry.
I'm trying to
find the shower?

149
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,092
You're the new girl.

150
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,828
Oh, my god.
Uh... Kim Baker.

151
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,797
Just got here from New York.

152
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,998
I'm Tanya. Oh, my god,

153
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,567
it's so nice to have another
woman in the house!

154
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:06,103
I love that lippy color.
What is that?

155
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,271
No, they're just really chapped.

156
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,407
Oh, you poor thing.
Can I get you anything?

157
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:14,278
I'm sorry, I'm freaking out
because I saw your

158
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,282
special about your embed in
korengal, and it was amazing.

159
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,384
Thank you.
That's so sweet.

160
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:23,621
Where's the shower?
Yes. This way.

161
00:10:24,623 --> 00:10:26,223
Can I ask a favor, Kim?

162
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:29,126
And absolutely
feel free to say no.
Yeah, sure.

163
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:29,893
I hate to even bring it up.

164
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:32,830
I feel so rude
even asking this.
No, it's fine.

165
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:35,933
Can I fuck your security guys?

166
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:38,135
What? Oh.

167
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,170
By all means, yeah.

168
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:41,171
Yeah? I mean,
i wouldn't ask,

169
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:43,107
it's just that for some reason,

170
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:45,042
the vbc use
an American contractor

171
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,578
and, I mean, no offense,
but they're all, like,

172
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,046
goatees and "fat-strong."

173
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:51,715
You know? But the aussies
and kiwis are so hot.

174
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,684
Right. I get it.
Be my guest.

175
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,786
You sure? Don't just
say that to be polite.

176
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:56,754
No, I wouldn't. I'm not.

177
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:59,590
Even nic? You don't
want nic for yourself?

178
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,158
Nic?

179
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,860
No. I don't. No.

180
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:05,562
That's... no, that
would never happen.
So you're good.

181
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:09,166
Hey! No, Kim,
don't say that.
You could have nic.

182
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:13,037
In Afghanistan,
you're a serious
piece of ass.

183
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,238
Thank you. That's nice.

184
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,040
Because you're what,
i mean, you're like,

185
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:19,410
a seven, a six or
seven in New York?

186
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:22,212
Here, you're a nine.

187
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,114
Borderline ten.

188
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:26,316
It's called "Kabul cute."

189
00:11:27,252 --> 00:11:30,020
What are you here, like a 15?

190
00:11:31,456 --> 00:11:32,823
Yeah.

191
00:11:33,658 --> 00:11:34,591
Huh.

192
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:37,795
The thing is, I have a very
serious boyfriend at home,

193
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:38,896
so, you're good.

194
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,097
All right, well, come talk
to me in two months

195
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:43,901
when your pussy's
eating your leg.
Shower's that way.

196
00:11:53,244 --> 00:11:54,511
How you doing?

197
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:57,715
It's bananas here.
It's, um...

198
00:11:57,982 --> 00:12:01,085
My nose is running.
There's shit in the air,

199
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:02,820
literally.

200
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,221
And

201
00:12:04,289 --> 00:12:06,457
I don't think I can do this.

202
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,392
Do what?

203
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,893
Kim?

204
00:12:10,528 --> 00:12:12,062
I don't think I can do this.

205
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,798
Can you see...
I don't... hello?

206
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,967
Shit.

207
00:12:30,815 --> 00:12:35,919
I'm sorry, colonel,
i can't accept gifts
as a journalist.

208
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:36,954
Okay.

209
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,188
So lodging, transport,

210
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,791
chow and protection,
that's all you can accept?

211
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:42,159
I'll do my best
to stay objective.

212
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:45,462
I don't care if
you can do your job.
I care if my men can.

213
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:49,533
Are you familiar with
the term "four-ten-four",
miss Baker?

214
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,701
I am not, colonel.

215
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:53,504
It refers to women
who are fours back home

216
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:54,905
become tens when they ship out

217
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:59,009
and when they're
back stateside, they
become fours again.

218
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:00,177
Are you saying I'm a four?

219
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:04,214
I'm saying you carry
an orange fucking backpack.

220
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:08,719
I've seen people
with actual experience
make bad decisions here.

221
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,321
So while you're outside
the wire with my men,

222
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:14,658
you will in no way
distract them,
understood?

223
00:13:14,859 --> 00:13:17,594
Are you asking me not
to sleep with your soldiers?

224
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,863
No, not "soldiers."
Marines.

225
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:20,864
You're not here to sleep with

226
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:24,568
or perform jobs of any
type on my marines.

227
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,470
Clear copy, miss Baker?

228
00:13:26,838 --> 00:13:27,971
Copy that.
Good.

229
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:31,508
We'll get you out to
a fob as soon as we
find a ride for you.

230
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,943
In the meantime,
captain stern here

231
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,412
will see to it that
you get a wet hootch.

232
00:13:36,181 --> 00:13:37,314
A what?

233
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,416
It's a tent with a shower.

234
00:13:39,918 --> 00:13:42,452
Unless you'd
prefer a dry hootch.

235
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:44,354
I would not, sir.

236
00:14:42,513 --> 00:14:44,214
Sorry.

237
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:47,718
Could you just...
State
your name and rank?

238
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,987
Gunnery sergeant
Clinton j. Hurd.

239
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,456
All right. Uh... dang it!

240
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,725
So, do you believe
the afghani people

241
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,194
are happy about
our presence here?

242
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,795
No, Afghans are the people.

243
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:02,132
Afghanis is the currency.

244
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:03,834
That's right.
I knew that. Thank you.

245
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,136
What do you believe
your mission to be here?

246
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:07,504
Ma'am, you got
a sticker on your pants.

247
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:10,540
It's bugging
the shit out
of me. Ma'am...

248
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:11,842
Fahim.

249
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,076
What inspired you
to enlist originally?

250
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:18,982
I'm a big fan of
the movie predator with
Arnold Schwarzenegger.

251
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:20,284
We're the same height.

252
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:23,654
Do you think the war
in Iraq has affected
your resources here?

253
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:27,791
I'm sorry, ma'am,
I'm not authorized to
answer that question.

254
00:15:28,326 --> 00:15:31,795
I'd say we're both
on the wrong side
of persia, ma'am.

255
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:33,730
Iraq is where you
get some right now.

256
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:34,564
Here just has shit all.

257
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:37,367
Are you guys getting
outside the wire much?

258
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:39,269
Yes, ma'am.
Most days. Uh...

259
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:42,572
You know, we help out with
community projects and all.

260
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:44,808
And Wells. Uh...

261
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,811
And sometimes at night
we shoot the big gun,

262
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:50,147
but, you know,
it's quiet here.
Jesus!

263
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,282
We don't wear ibas on the fob.

264
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,918
I don't even chamber
a round in my weapon
anymore, because,

265
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,789
you know, I figure
accidental discharge is
scarier than the Taliban.

266
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:03,460
With Iraq, do you feel
like people have forgotten
about Afghanistan?

267
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,328
Oh, well...

268
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:08,332
Yes, ma'am. I'd say that
surely is the word for it.

269
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,468
This here's a forgotten war.

270
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,071
It's capital f, capital w.

271
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:17,274
What's your, uh...
Your name and rank?

272
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:22,012
I'm Lance corporal coughlin,
India company 3-5.

273
00:16:23,348 --> 00:16:24,681
Thank you.

274
00:16:31,122 --> 00:16:33,523
Kim. Your hair.

275
00:16:35,393 --> 00:16:37,494
Thanks, fahim.
Mmm-hmm.

276
00:16:38,463 --> 00:16:40,630
You really are a fixer.

277
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:46,870
Moon's out.

278
00:16:48,272 --> 00:16:49,439
Hmm.

279
00:16:49,674 --> 00:16:51,208
It's beautiful.

280
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:02,185
What does that mean?

281
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:05,989
It means, "oh, what
a terrible event!"
Uh-huh.

282
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:06,723
Miss Baker.

283
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,859
Colonel hollanek
is coming to
Norton tomorrow

284
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,327
to check on some
of our prt work.

285
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,996
And you and your crew
are clear to tag along.

286
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:14,164
Great, thanks.

287
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,066
Rolls out at zero-six.

288
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,136
That's 6:00 A.M.
i know that, yeah.

289
00:17:19,704 --> 00:17:21,705
Fire!

290
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,775
Come on, let's go!
Get this shit together!
We gotta move!

291
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,543
Fucking hands out
of your pockets!

292
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,278
You think you're
in the fucking army?

293
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,881
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

294
00:17:31,983 --> 00:17:32,682
What is this?

295
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,651
Uh, that's my supplies.
Camera stuff.

296
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:35,886
You fucking kidding me?

297
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:40,323
This is an orange
ruck. No, ma'am.
Not on my vehicle.

298
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:42,092
The girl at the north face store

299
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,126
said it was,
like, military grade.

300
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:46,229
Well, where are you
gonna hide it?
Inside a fucking sunset?

301
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:50,434
I mean, even
the Dutch army
don't wear orange.

302
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,002
Fix it.

303
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,504
How do I fix it?

304
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:56,073
Rapono!

305
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:13,990
Got to stay hydrated, ma'am.

306
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:16,560
Coughlin.
I didn't recognize you.

307
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:18,962
That's 'cause I'm
in warrior mode.

308
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:21,364
It makes me taller.

309
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,068
Enjoy the ride, ma'am.

310
00:18:48,893 --> 00:18:51,528
I'm dying to
know who blew up my well.

311
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,363
Working on it, colonel.

312
00:18:53,764 --> 00:18:56,199
That was a nice
fucking well, corporal.

313
00:19:00,972 --> 00:19:02,305
What'd he say?

314
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,377
What's that mean?

315
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:10,280
He wants to know
if you are the Russians.

316
00:19:11,415 --> 00:19:13,316
The Russians?
Mmm.

317
00:19:13,951 --> 00:19:15,285
No!

318
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:18,121
No, sir. That was
20 years ago.

319
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:19,956
And we're here to help.

320
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:23,994
And I'm black.

321
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:34,838
If we fix the well,
you can't blow it up.

322
00:19:35,673 --> 00:19:38,475
Kim, I was
talking to some
of the younger men.

323
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,410
They say
the Taliban
came at night.

324
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:43,213
I don't care. No.
I drank too much water
and I have to pee.

325
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:46,316
Stop. Stop.
I am engaged
to be married.

326
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:49,452
Okay, fahim,
i know you like your
women to be, like,

327
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,755
beautiful, mysterious
Ikea bags, okay?

328
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:55,759
But we urinate, doctor.
Out of our vaginas.

329
00:19:56,527 --> 00:19:58,028
You think you urinate out the...

330
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,763
No. I know it's
a separate thing!

331
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:00,797
God! Just please help me.

332
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,732
There is nowhere for you to go.

333
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:04,401
I cannot ask
these men about this.

334
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:05,902
And I'm not allowed
to talk to the women.

335
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:10,173
Fine. Forget it. I'll hold it.
Women are tough, right?

336
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,517
Are you okay, ma'am?

337
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,386
- Gosh, damn it, man.
- This is a new one.

338
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:27,924
I was cursing your
name at 0-stupid-30, but
I'm glad I came out today.

339
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:31,194
Would you not have
gone on patrol today
if I weren't here?

340
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:33,196
No, I'd be back in
Norton filling hescos.

341
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:34,331
Copy that.

342
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,367
We're still 5 Mikes.
It must be one hairy dump.

343
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:40,604
No, I'm just getting
my pants on.
Damn it, sergeant hurd.

344
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:41,705
Whatever.

345
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:42,973
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

346
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,107
Marine!

347
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:46,276
Make a hole, Baker.

348
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,783
Move out!

349
00:21:22,513 --> 00:21:25,115
Why are we stopping?

350
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,916
The lead vehicle bottomed out.

351
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:30,654
Okay!
Heads on a swivel!

352
00:21:31,155 --> 00:21:33,223
Didn't we come this way?

353
00:21:33,391 --> 00:21:35,058
We most surely did.

354
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:41,464
Contact left!
Stay in the vehicle!

355
00:21:44,402 --> 00:21:48,538
Shit! Hot! Hot bullet things!

356
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:55,812
Kim, don't get out
of the car! Kim!

357
00:22:00,117 --> 00:22:01,451
Whoa!

358
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:04,287
Get down behind
the engine block!

359
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,523
Stay there! Stay there!

360
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,958
Kim.

361
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,760
Get back in the car!

362
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:23,473
No, please, Kim!

363
00:22:37,955 --> 00:22:39,923
Ma'am, I asked you to stay put!

364
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:42,192
Those assholes
tried to shoot us!

365
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,361
Jesus!

366
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,229
You have got to be shitting me!

367
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:49,699
You just shot
a javelin at
a fucking car!

368
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,701
That's an $80,000
piece of ordnance!

369
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:55,472
Can any of you
geniuses tell me the
kelley blue book value

370
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:58,908
of a 1989 Toyota pickup?

371
00:23:09,687 --> 00:23:13,356
Oorah, Baker. Get some.

372
00:23:17,328 --> 00:23:19,829
I hope you got all
that on film, ma'am.

373
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:22,699
'Cause that right there,
that's what we do best.

374
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:23,767
Hearts and minds.

375
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:27,203
That's the two best places
to shoot somebody.

376
00:23:31,475 --> 00:23:32,075
What?

377
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,710
I told you to stay in the car.

378
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:36,479
Okay, I'll get back in the car.

379
00:23:36,547 --> 00:23:38,915
The marines don't have
much to say about Iraq.

380
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:42,819
Their mantra is that
they are focused on
doing the job here.

381
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,854
And even though,
as we saw firsthand,

382
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:47,690
attacks against
coalition forces are up,

383
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:51,127
corporal coughlin
told me earlier that
he is still not planning

384
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:54,898
to lock and load his weapon
when he is out on patrol.

385
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,901
Our own Kim Baker
reporting for us live.

386
00:24:01,939 --> 00:24:03,406
Welcome!

387
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,545
Wow, good job,
Kim! Ruthless!

388
00:24:10,247 --> 00:24:13,817
Bitch, we are going
out tonight! Whoo!

389
00:24:41,111 --> 00:24:43,413
It's okay. It's okay. Here.

390
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:49,319
It's okay. It's all right.

391
00:24:58,462 --> 00:25:00,396
Why don't I know who you are?

392
00:25:01,398 --> 00:25:04,834
You're what, like, 42?

393
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:05,335
Sold.

394
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,569
Why have I never heard of you?

395
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:10,206
Yeah, I haven't done
a lot of overseas reporting.

396
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:14,244
I've done mostly
domestic reportage.

397
00:25:15,246 --> 00:25:15,979
"Reportage"?

398
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:18,414
Domestic reportage.

399
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:22,485
Look, everyone in
the kabubble is
full of shit. It's okay.

400
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:23,119
Half the accents are fake.

401
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:28,057
The whole "I'm
ex-special forces" wankers
are flat out lying.

402
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:30,260
"Reportage"?

403
00:25:31,896 --> 00:25:34,397
Oh, Christ, what is this?

404
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,599
I really shouldn't have
my back to the door.

405
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:37,700
It's bad tradecraft,

406
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:41,271
but it's worth it to
talk to you two ladies.

407
00:25:42,473 --> 00:25:44,107
Fuck off.
Ugh.

408
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:45,942
You got it.

409
00:25:46,877 --> 00:25:49,279
Champagne?

410
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:50,880
Thank you.

411
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:51,314
Finish this,

412
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:53,650
and then we'll go
meet some friends
in wazir akbar Khan.

413
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:56,753
And I am warning you now,
do not sleep with iain.

414
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:59,122
Who is iain?
He's a proper asshole.

415
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:01,591
Shall we?
Yeah.

416
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:03,259
Is that a cab?

417
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:08,898
Is your full name Shakira?

418
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,701
'Cause I thought it was
a Colombian nickname.

419
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:12,669
Why would you think that?

420
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:13,603
Because of the singer.

421
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:18,508
No, I know.
I'm kidding. No, it's
arabic for "thankful."

422
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,943
Kim is American
for "white lady."

423
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:24,280
Actually, "Kim"
means "who" in turkish.

424
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:26,015
"Who's that white lady?"

425
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:27,183
It's Kim.

426
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:30,019
That's so you can
remember my name.

427
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:32,922
So... this is iain.
Iain, Kim.

428
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:37,026
Kim. Kim. Kim.
Kim, nice work.

429
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:40,263
You sit next to the
only two women in a
country the size of Texas

430
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,633
that remind a man
that you're really
only okay looking.

431
00:26:44,168 --> 00:26:46,736
Well, she said
you were an asshole,

432
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,438
but that's really
above and beyond.

433
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,238
Who said that?
Tanya.

434
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,607
No. No. No.
I don't think so.

435
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,508
A lot of women find me
very charming, Kim.

436
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,478
No, not biological women.
Oh, really?

437
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,312
Women who think that an accent

438
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:59,248
is the same thing
as a personality, maybe.
Oh!

439
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,883
Nae, haud yer wheesht.

440
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:03,786
Go bile yer heid, ya wee bampot.

441
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:07,824
I bet you're wetter
than a submarine
with screen doors now.

442
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:09,058
Oh!

443
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,927
I got that from a pickup book.

444
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,629
Jesus.
Oh, yeah.

445
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:13,863
Mmm.

446
00:27:14,064 --> 00:27:14,964
So what's your deal?

447
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,733
You got chucked over by some guy

448
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,067
so you think, "forget him.

449
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:20,003
"I'm gonna go discover
the wonders of the east,

450
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:22,939
"and I'm gonna
fuck a Scottish guy
and write a book."

451
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:25,141
I'm Scottish, by the way.

452
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,313
Cheers.

453
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,048
Cheers.

454
00:27:35,886 --> 00:27:37,520
- Cheers.
- Salud.

455
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:40,023
- Cheers.
- To Kim!

456
00:27:41,592 --> 00:27:43,793
Is this your first night out?

457
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:45,328
Yes.

458
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,330
It is, actually.

459
00:27:48,432 --> 00:27:51,334
That little bastard!

460
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:51,801
Oh, no, Kim.

461
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:55,004
You didn't give egg boy
money, did you?

462
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:59,242
Hey! Egg boy! Hey!
You're a little shitbird!

463
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,111
I hope you get salmonella!

464
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:04,247
Oh!

465
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:05,982
I gave him, like, $100!

466
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,517
$100?
What?

467
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,887
I'd give you my eggs for $100.

468
00:28:11,622 --> 00:28:12,255
Where are we going?

469
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:15,525
A whorehouse.
You're going to love it.

470
00:28:18,929 --> 00:28:20,329
You see that?

471
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:23,299
It's a brothel
and a Chinese restaurant.

472
00:28:36,246 --> 00:28:37,914
Do you remember this video?

473
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,451
Everybody was drawings.

474
00:28:44,221 --> 00:28:46,389
Me? Oh, no, thank you.

475
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:50,593
Look, a month ago,
i was writing a story
about corn syrup.

476
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:51,794
Okay? I was not happy.

477
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:55,131
I didn't think
there was anything else
out there for me.

478
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:55,832
Just death.

479
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:58,534
Then this came along and...

480
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:03,372
Wenge, do you guys
have regular
access to healthcare?

481
00:29:13,784 --> 00:29:14,650
He called me a fenian bastard.

482
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:18,121
I fuckin' showed him
what for, kicked
his teeth in, the cunt.

483
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:21,290
Oi, Tanya?
What's her story?

484
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:25,595
She has a boyfriend.
And she's unconscious, okay?

485
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,664
Not that either of
those things have ever
stopped you before.

486
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:30,399
That's not true.
That's not true.

487
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:32,902
Firstly, I'm afraid
of boyfriends.
Mmm-hmm.

488
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:35,171
Secondly, I'm a gentleman.

489
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:40,143
What? According to
no less an authority
than grace mugabe.

490
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:41,444
I held a door open for her once.

491
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,247
Let me just
have a little peekaboo.

492
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:45,214
Get out!

493
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:47,650
Actually, not bad.

494
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:50,920
- I think I missed one.
- Stop!

495
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:54,223
Il y a du monde
au balcon. Pas mal.

496
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:55,158
Kim?

497
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,492
You all right there, mate?

498
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:58,027
Oh, wouldn't you like to know?

499
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,862
Hey. I'm just talking
about her safety.

500
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:04,200
Nic here does
security for Kim, iain.

501
00:30:11,508 --> 00:30:13,242
Right, well!

502
00:30:13,477 --> 00:30:16,212
I'm off. Excuse me.

503
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:17,146
Excused.
Good night.

504
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,882
- Bye, darling!
- Good night.

505
00:30:22,252 --> 00:30:24,654
The best, nic!

506
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:39,168
Oh, that's Oprah.

507
00:30:50,981 --> 00:30:51,647
Hello.

508
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:55,017
It's fahim.
Are you ready to go?

509
00:30:55,219 --> 00:30:57,119
Go where, dude?
It's Saturday.

510
00:30:57,121 --> 00:31:00,056
Friday is the only day off
in the islamic week.

511
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:01,057
We have interviews.

512
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:03,392
No! That was not made
clear. That's... no.

513
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:05,094
That's bullshit, fahim. No.

514
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:07,630
Kim, today we are
meeting Ali massoud sadiq.

515
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:11,467
I sent research.
He's likely to be
Attorney General.

516
00:31:17,341 --> 00:31:19,175
Please hold.
Please come outside.

517
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:22,712
This is against
what I believe
as an American.

518
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,947
I am sorry, but we have to go.

519
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:26,382
Oh, my shoes. Shit.

520
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:29,652
You wish to interview
me, Mr. ahmadzai?

521
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:33,289
I do, Mr. sadiq.
Yes, on camera.

522
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:35,091
Mr. ahmadzai,

523
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:37,193
I am a person of,

524
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:39,428
of no consequence.

525
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,363
Well, you soon might be

526
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:43,466
the second most powerful
person in Afghanistan.

527
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:43,933
Mr. ahmadzai,

528
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:47,336
I run a small department
inside the interior ministry.

529
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:50,706
What possible interest
could I be to the Americans?

530
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:54,577
Because your ministry
for the prevention of vice

531
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:55,912
and the encouragement of virtue

532
00:31:55,914 --> 00:32:01,384
sounds a lot like
the Taliban's old
ministry of vice and virtue.

533
00:32:03,654 --> 00:32:05,388
Don't you think?

534
00:32:13,697 --> 00:32:16,098
- Kim Baker.
Mmm-hmm.

535
00:32:19,069 --> 00:32:21,704
When the Taliban was in power,

536
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:24,473
they enforced their
version of sharia.

537
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:25,541
One of their edicts
was a rule that

538
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:27,910
all men must shave
the hair of their pubis.

539
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:32,915
They would walk
the streets carrying
a small wooden rod,

540
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:33,516
a dowel,

541
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:36,986
which they would
roll along the front
of a man's trousers.

542
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:42,558
If a man's pubic hair
was long enough to
curl around the dowel,

543
00:32:43,527 --> 00:32:45,895
they would beat him.

544
00:32:46,697 --> 00:32:48,130
Now, I ask you,

545
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,733
do I look like a man
to walk the streets

546
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:54,303
carrying a
hair-of-the-pubis dowel?

547
00:32:55,005 --> 00:32:57,039
No, sir, you do not.

548
00:32:57,641 --> 00:33:01,911
I returned to this
country to save it.

549
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:03,879
I am a friend of America.

550
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:05,681
Which is why you should
let me interview you,

551
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:08,584
so people can understand that.

552
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:11,420
I like you, Kim.

553
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:13,089
I like your mouthiness.

554
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:15,691
That is a word, yes?

555
00:33:16,093 --> 00:33:18,594
It reminds me of
my time living in London.

556
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:23,299
You make me feel
like a young man
again.

557
00:33:23,633 --> 00:33:26,168
But I do not know you.

558
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:31,374
How can we
get to know
each other, Kim?

559
00:33:33,877 --> 00:33:35,044
Hmm?

560
00:33:38,415 --> 00:33:41,117
Yes, excellent, Kim!

561
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:45,788
Put a turban on her,
she'd make
a very handsome boy.

562
00:34:21,491 --> 00:34:23,926
How are you?
You okay there?

563
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:26,328
What the hell was that?

564
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,631
It's probably
just a wedding
somewhere nearby.

565
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,800
They like to shoot off
guns at weddings here.

566
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:32,902
You get it, you're from Florida.

567
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,036
Funny.

568
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:35,905
When was the last
time I saw you?

569
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:36,906
Since June?

570
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:40,109
I'm sorry that I didn't
get back last month.

571
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:42,478
I can be in New York
by Thursday.

572
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,248
I miss you and I want
to see you. And I...

573
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,283
I have...

574
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:49,952
Oh, not again.

575
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:53,756
I hate this fucking airport.

576
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,759
Can I bring you guys
anything from New York?

577
00:34:56,761 --> 00:35:00,096
Just bring us back
a six pack, eh?

578
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,665
- This is Kim.
- Kim Baker?

579
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:04,867
It is sadiq.

580
00:35:05,635 --> 00:35:07,903
Mr. sadiq, hi.

581
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:11,240
How about an interview
with pacha Khan?

582
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:12,908
Pacha Khan, the warlord?

583
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:15,244
Pacha Khan is a businessman.

584
00:35:15,412 --> 00:35:16,011
Would you like that?

585
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:19,815
Uh, yeah. Yeah. But I'm
on my way to New York
to see my boyfriend.

586
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:22,218
You will be the first
western journalist

587
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,354
to interview him
since the Soviet war.

588
00:35:26,256 --> 00:35:28,591
Shall we say tomorrow?

589
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:37,333
Okay, yes, of course.
Thank you.

590
00:35:39,035 --> 00:35:41,170
What?
Back in the car.

591
00:35:43,607 --> 00:35:45,241
Wait here.

592
00:35:51,848 --> 00:35:53,682
It's okay, come.

593
00:36:52,142 --> 00:36:53,309
Hmm.

594
00:36:56,713 --> 00:36:58,113
Okay. Yes.
Yeah?

595
00:36:58,115 --> 00:36:59,582
Okay.

596
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:06,088
Pacha Khan, thank you
for your kind hospitality.

597
00:37:22,906 --> 00:37:24,273
What?

598
00:37:25,575 --> 00:37:27,109
No.

599
00:37:28,578 --> 00:37:30,246
Oh, Kim. Cheers.

600
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,380
Hi.

601
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:31,880
What a rush, yeah?

602
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:36,685
Pacha Khan, yeah.
It's like, adrenaline.
Everyone was...

603
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:38,020
Good job.

604
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:39,054
Yeah, it went well.

605
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:42,591
But, you know, I was...
I was in the...

606
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:43,826
The New Zealand sas back home.

607
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:46,729
And today felt
like jumping out
of an airplane.

608
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:50,933
Or like, you know,
like having sex.

609
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:56,739
Kim!

610
00:37:57,274 --> 00:38:00,843
Tanya's got scotch.
It won't last long, so...

611
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:04,046
Nic, you're welcome,
too, you big cunt!

612
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:08,284
That's a term of
affection, by the way.

613
00:38:08,685 --> 00:38:13,422
You were
supposed to be in
New York, sneaky girl.

614
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:16,725
Yeah, Chris is
not super pleased.

615
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:19,461
Chris can suck a fat one.

616
00:38:20,864 --> 00:38:22,731
I'm trying to see if
they put my story up,

617
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:25,401
but this Internet
connection is the worst!

618
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:27,970
Oh, goddamn it, jaweed!

619
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,405
Oh, Christ!

620
00:38:29,472 --> 00:38:30,172
- Really?
- Wow.

621
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:34,009
Although, donkeys aside,
he's a good fixer.
Mmm.

622
00:38:34,544 --> 00:38:37,813
Oh, no, thanks.
Morning shows.

623
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,916
You have something they
want for the mornings?

624
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:45,587
Maybe. I don't know. Maybe.

625
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:46,221
Hmm.

626
00:38:46,223 --> 00:38:48,590
That's what I'm trying to see.

627
00:38:48,658 --> 00:38:52,695
You know, I heard
that he has contacts
in the tribals.

628
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:56,031
Like real Taliban contacts.

629
00:38:56,299 --> 00:38:57,633
- Jaweed?
- Jaweed.

630
00:38:57,635 --> 00:39:00,369
- No fucking way.
- Mmm, apparently.

631
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:04,106
Would you do that?
Would you go down there?

632
00:39:07,344 --> 00:39:10,045
Yeah, sure, if it
was the right call.

633
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:12,948
Yeah, but how do you know
if it's the right call?

634
00:39:15,485 --> 00:39:17,986
Fuck, man, I don't know.

635
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:19,755
That is why we drink, do drugs

636
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:23,225
and shag strangers
in restaurant bathrooms.

637
00:39:44,514 --> 00:39:45,748
Kim, are you okay?
What's going on?

638
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,950
Oh, shoot. Oh, sorry,
what time is it?

639
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:49,218
I don't know.
I'm in Seattle.

640
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,020
God, I thought you got shot
at a wedding or something.

641
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:53,155
Jesus, Kim!
No.

642
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:55,190
Sorry. So, just real quick...

643
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:56,492
I want you to come visit me.

644
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:57,760
In Afghanistan? Really?

645
00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:58,927
I mean, I've got tons of miles.

646
00:39:58,929 --> 00:39:59,595
I could fly you first class.

647
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:01,864
I have to look at a
calendar. I don't think
I can do it this month.

648
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:03,399
I'm here until,
like, at least the 15th.

649
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,433
But when I get back maybe...

650
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:07,269
Who is in your bed, Chris?
What?

651
00:40:07,537 --> 00:40:09,371
No, that's my bag.

652
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:12,141
Look in the mirror, dipshit.

653
00:40:12,976 --> 00:40:16,345
My god. You motherfucker.
Unbelievable. Unbelievable!

654
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:17,479
You calm the fuck down!

655
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:19,448
Listen, you haven't
been home in months.

656
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,416
You forgot my fucking birthday!

657
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,184
Oh, right, it's my
fault. Great, Chris.
You're a genius.

658
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:24,420
And I kept your stupid
fucking plants alive,

659
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:28,023
but you let this relationship
wither and die!

660
00:40:28,324 --> 00:40:31,760
Ugh! Did you
have that prepared?

661
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:32,494
What?
Pussy!

662
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:33,729
You know what?
Have fun in Seattle.

663
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:35,130
You should go to the
rock 'n' roll museum.

664
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:37,199
It sucks.
You'll fit right in.

665
00:40:57,353 --> 00:40:59,621
Are you shitting me?

666
00:41:06,996 --> 00:41:07,896
Fahim.

667
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:10,265
Let's apply for another embed.

668
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:12,000
Because I want to
get out of Kabul.

669
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:16,038
I just need to get out of Kabul.

670
00:41:16,973 --> 00:41:19,208
I need "me time",
exactly. That's...

671
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,576
See? I told you
that o magazine

672
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:24,379
would increase your
understanding of women.

673
00:41:34,457 --> 00:41:37,059
Hey, you guys
are 3-5, right?

674
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:39,261
Do you know a corporal coughlin?

675
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:39,795
No, ma'am.

676
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:43,165
Sorry, but I've only
been here for
a couple months.

677
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,168
Ma'am, if you set one foot
in front of the other,

678
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:50,272
there's less chance
you lose both feet
if we hit an ied.

679
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,711
Vides, make ready.

680
00:42:01,351 --> 00:42:03,719
Man, we are
definitely losing
the war

681
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:06,221
when it comes to
this particular well.

682
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:08,323
I swear to god,
they blow up another well,

683
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:09,591
I take another
pair of boots off.

684
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:12,594
It's like fucking
musical chairs.

685
00:42:13,296 --> 00:42:15,497
Hey, do I have to
buy a dress
for your wedding?

686
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:19,568
No. Whatever you
wear in Kabul is fine.

687
00:42:19,936 --> 00:42:22,037
Yeah?
Yes.

688
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:27,109
The only thing I ask
is that you make sure
my friend is there.

689
00:42:28,545 --> 00:42:31,079
Aw, your friend is me.

690
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:34,216
I get it.

691
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:31,740
Mount up!
Jesus, stern!

692
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:35,611
General, excuse me.
Hey. General, do you
have a minute?

693
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:36,912
Not now, Baker.

694
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:38,080
It's just...

695
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:40,916
The Taliban haven't been
destroying the well here.

696
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:44,019
The women of the village
are destroying it.

697
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:46,121
Or so they tell me.

698
00:43:48,224 --> 00:43:50,826
We dug that well
several times
for the women

699
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:52,794
so they don't have
to walk to the river.

700
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,563
But they want to
walk to the river.

701
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:57,199
It's their only
chance to be social

702
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:59,201
and gossip and,
you know, hang out.

703
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:02,170
I think that they
have a bunch of
old Soviet landmines,

704
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:06,308
and they just prop one up
and throw rocks at it.

705
00:44:18,121 --> 00:44:20,689
Kim, did you ever feel like
you're Manning that tollgate

706
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:24,493
and the engineer's yelling,
"i got pig iron,
i got pig iron"?

707
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,429
No. I don't know
what that means.
But it's very folksy.

708
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:29,931
Also, the women, obviously,
they don't want the men

709
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:31,266
to know about this,
so they are hoping

710
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:34,603
that you would just refuse
to repair the well this time.

711
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:35,170
Well, they're in luck.

712
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:38,540
That's exactly what
i told the mullah, so...

713
00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:42,778
Well done, Baker.

714
00:44:43,246 --> 00:44:45,047
Hooyah, general.

715
00:44:45,815 --> 00:44:48,283
Marines say "oorah."

716
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:50,352
The Navy says "hooyah."

717
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:53,055
Don't mix those two up.
Got it.

718
00:44:53,389 --> 00:44:55,857
Have a good...
Have a good ride.

719
00:45:19,315 --> 00:45:20,582
Kim.

720
00:45:23,319 --> 00:45:24,553
Kim.

721
00:45:28,758 --> 00:45:29,991
Sorry.

722
00:45:42,538 --> 00:45:45,240
You look beautiful!
You look beautiful!

723
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:46,541
Oh, my god.

724
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,482
- Oh, my god.
- Oh, no!

725
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:55,016
Kim!

726
00:45:56,419 --> 00:45:57,319
What the dick?

727
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:59,187
Why did fahim tell me
i could dress like this?

728
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:01,857
Well, he didn't
want you to have to
go buy something.

729
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:04,126
Oh, my god. I only washed
the front of my hair.

730
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:05,861
Here.
You know what?

731
00:46:06,195 --> 00:46:08,063
I'm going to let you
have one of these.

732
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:09,564
Thank you.

733
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:10,832
Now I look great.

734
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:12,200
Now you're ready.

735
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:13,468
Now I'm ready to party.

736
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:14,636
Oh, she likes it.

737
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:17,672
- Sure.
- Oh, wow. Well...

738
00:46:35,391 --> 00:46:39,895
It was worse than
a unibrow. It went all
the way into his hair.

739
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:42,864
We all have some reason
for being here.

740
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:44,599
What's your reason?

741
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:45,267
What is yours?

742
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:46,601
I don't have a good one.
I'm just here.

743
00:46:46,603 --> 00:46:48,770
Come on, she just told
her unibrow story.

744
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:50,572
I just... I don't have one.

745
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:51,940
Come on.

746
00:46:53,109 --> 00:46:57,879
I was at the gym after work
one night. Stationary bike.

747
00:46:57,881 --> 00:47:01,082
Okay? The same
bike every day.

748
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:03,752
And I notice this

749
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:04,653
indentation in the carpet,

750
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,721
it's, like, a foot
in front of my bike.

751
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:11,092
And I realize that it's from
where my bike used to be.

752
00:47:13,162 --> 00:47:17,666
I have done thousands
of miles on this bike

753
00:47:18,067 --> 00:47:20,168
and I have gone backwards.

754
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,938
I have literally gone backwards.

755
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:23,805
I just

756
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:27,108
wanted to blow everything up.
I just wanted out of my job,

757
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:31,546
writing news scripts for
dumb pretty people to read.

758
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:33,381
I wanted...

759
00:47:33,516 --> 00:47:35,183
out of having to decide whether

760
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:39,521
I should just
marry my mildly
depressive boyfriend.

761
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,223
And that's it.

762
00:47:41,691 --> 00:47:44,359
I just... I couldn't
look at that

763
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,595
fucking carpet anymore.

764
00:47:49,699 --> 00:47:51,900
Oh...

765
00:47:53,169 --> 00:47:56,304
Well, that is
officially the most

766
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:58,640
American white lady
story I've ever heard.

767
00:47:58,642 --> 00:48:01,409
- Shut up.
- It is.

768
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:02,377
You know what?
Fuck that.

769
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:07,282
You are a battle-tested
foreign correspondent.

770
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:10,485
You're a solid Kabul 9.5.

771
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:12,654
And you are fucking
single, all right?

772
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:16,558
So that lady back at
the gym, she's dead.

773
00:48:16,959 --> 00:48:18,894
This is your life.

774
00:48:41,617 --> 00:48:44,019
Despite Taliban threats,
election observers

775
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:46,187
are reporting
high voter turnout,

776
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:47,255
especially in cities.

777
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,257
A British fighter-bomber
last week

778
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,026
reduced this compound to rubble.

779
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:55,163
Not to cooperate.
Oh, god. Christ, there's a...

780
00:48:56,265 --> 00:48:58,133
Bahzo! There's a bahzo here!

781
00:48:58,135 --> 00:49:01,503
The surprise visit
from secretary of
defense Donald rumsfeld.

782
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:04,673
Today, Kabul's first
licensed female driver,

783
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:07,842
gulbahar yousofy, hits the road.

784
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,281
That sucks.
That sucks for women.

785
00:49:15,685 --> 00:49:17,218
Thank you.

786
00:49:19,455 --> 00:49:20,822
Congratulations
on your promotion,

787
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:22,390
Mr. Attorney General.
Thank you.

788
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:24,059
As I said, we could have
done this over the phone.

789
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:26,928
I'm just looking
for a statement on
sharia in kandahar.

790
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:28,897
I understand that
you are no longer

791
00:49:28,899 --> 00:49:31,466
with your special friend Chris.

792
00:49:32,601 --> 00:49:33,468
Who told you that?

793
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,869
Very little happens
in Afghanistan

794
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:38,707
that Ali massoud sadiq
does not know about.

795
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:40,175
Very little.

796
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:41,676
May I show you something?

797
00:49:41,678 --> 00:49:43,078
Of course.

798
00:49:48,884 --> 00:49:50,819
You have a bed in your office.

799
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,153
Yes.

800
00:49:52,455 --> 00:49:54,823
There is a bed here now.

801
00:49:56,759 --> 00:50:01,763
So, no comment on
sharia in kandahar or...

802
00:50:06,102 --> 00:50:06,701
No comment.

803
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:09,504
We are going to
isaf later, yes?
I don't know.

804
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:12,207
Pressers and
"right of boom" crap.
Who cares?

805
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:13,508
We need
to enterprise
something. Okay?

806
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,478
We need to get
out of the bubble.

807
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,179
Oh, that hit the net.

808
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,248
The what?
It hit the net.

809
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,150
The invisible net?
Yes.

810
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:23,218
My point.
Let's go. Bullshit.

811
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:26,221
You know, Kim, the reason
that your village well
story got traction is

812
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:29,357
because it wasn't a bang-bang,
it was about women's rights.

813
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,326
It was a brilliant piece, that.

814
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:32,861
Oh, fucking hell.

815
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:35,196
We should go to kandahar.

816
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:35,697
No, too dangerous.

817
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,833
No way. It's a wee bit
fluid down there these days,

818
00:50:38,835 --> 00:50:39,334
security-wise.

819
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:41,436
Yeah, it might
be a bit much
for you, eh, nic?

820
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:42,437
You're a bit late to the whole

821
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:43,838
"kandahar's gone
to shit" party.
You know?

822
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,940
What about the woman thing
where the sharia law is back?

823
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:47,809
And there was
a firebombing there
the other day.

824
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:48,910
Yeah, I think
it's worth the risk.

825
00:50:48,912 --> 00:50:50,311
Iain, that's easy for
you to say, mate,

826
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:53,314
sitting there in your
cozzie taking photos
of the fucking garden.

827
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:55,917
Look, Nicky,
i know you've been
specially trained

828
00:50:55,919 --> 00:50:59,054
to protect New Zealand from,
what, fucking dolphins?

829
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,922
But I'm not exactly
a war zone virgin, you know?

830
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:04,559
I was kidnapped by
the aig when they
were still called that.

831
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,294
Why dolphins?

832
00:51:06,296 --> 00:51:07,829
What do dolphins got to
do with New Zealand?

833
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:09,097
Nothing to do
with it. I'm just...

834
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:10,131
White pointers and sharks,

835
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:10,965
but the dolphins
never hurt anyone.

836
00:51:10,967 --> 00:51:13,668
I know they've not
hurt anyone, mate.
I'm just making the point...

837
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:15,070
I'm not gonna protect my country

838
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,305
from an animal that
hasn't hurt anyone.

839
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:18,673
Oh, Jesus Christ.

840
00:51:18,675 --> 00:51:20,909
Dolphins? What a joke.

841
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,510
I'll come with you
in the car if there's room.

842
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:25,313
Oh, great,
we're all going
to kandahar!

843
00:51:26,849 --> 00:51:30,452
I can make some calls.
We can take my car.

844
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:32,620
Kim, if we are
going to kandahar,

845
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:35,924
you will need to
buy some new clothes.

846
00:51:36,158 --> 00:51:37,692
I can't...

847
00:51:45,801 --> 00:51:49,871
Ah! It's so pretty,
i don't even want to vote.

848
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:20,401
I'm flipping you the bird
in here right now.

849
00:52:20,403 --> 00:52:21,803
- Is this your car, fahim?
- Yes.

850
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:23,438
This is a fucking piece of shit.

851
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,807
I think it's very nice.

852
00:52:29,879 --> 00:52:31,779
No one is staring
at me. It's weird.

853
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:35,383
You are in the blue prison now.

854
00:53:08,317 --> 00:53:10,285
Fahim, what does
the graffiti say?

855
00:53:10,287 --> 00:53:12,787
"No education for woman."

856
00:53:16,825 --> 00:53:18,960
Brian.
Huh?

857
00:53:40,416 --> 00:53:42,517
Fahim, what's going on up there?

858
00:53:44,987 --> 00:53:46,821
The Taliban used to do this.

859
00:53:46,956 --> 00:53:50,225
Execute the radios
and televisions.

860
00:53:53,862 --> 00:53:56,231
Oh, shit!

861
00:54:00,402 --> 00:54:01,669
Get out of the way!

862
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:02,604
Move on! Move on!

863
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:05,807
You guys can't go
out there, but I can.

864
00:54:10,946 --> 00:54:13,815
- Kim, come back.
- Kim, wait! Come back.

865
00:54:55,557 --> 00:54:58,559
Kim, now.
We must hurry.
We must hurry.

866
00:55:13,709 --> 00:55:15,643
Get in the car!

867
00:55:18,013 --> 00:55:20,014
Get out of here!

868
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:26,487
That was a men's
park, Kim! Men only!

869
00:55:27,923 --> 00:55:29,324
Fuck!

870
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,594
Bebakhshid, fahim.

871
00:55:40,169 --> 00:55:41,936
Coalition capacity,

872
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:42,704
priorities and support.

873
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:48,810
Let's look now at
the 12 first-tier drivers
in the current coin paradigm.

874
00:55:49,211 --> 00:55:49,544
Shit.

875
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:51,446
Tactical and institutional...

876
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:53,247
is always in purple,

877
00:55:53,249 --> 00:55:55,116
and noting as such...

878
00:55:55,417 --> 00:55:56,784
Kim Baker.

879
00:55:56,786 --> 00:55:58,119
Sir, do you have a minute?

880
00:55:58,121 --> 00:55:59,954
If I'm
understanding
this briefing,

881
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:01,422
I have all
the fucking time
in the world.

882
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:04,325
Okay.
Well, I'm covering
the girls' school

883
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:05,126
in kandahar that was firebombed

884
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:08,830
and I'm wondering
if you could give me
something, on background,

885
00:56:08,832 --> 00:56:12,200
just about the security
situation here

886
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:14,369
and the state of
the war in general.

887
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:15,870
Yeah, I can give you something:

888
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:17,171
This war is like
fucking a gorilla.

889
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:20,308
You keep going till
the gorilla wants to stop.

890
00:56:20,676 --> 00:56:22,744
I think I can paraphrase that.

891
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:24,746
Knock yourself out.

892
00:56:37,793 --> 00:56:44,065
You know, Afghanistan
produces 90% of the
world's narcotic opiates.

893
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:46,067
- So they say.
- Mmm.

894
00:56:46,502 --> 00:56:49,570
When I worked in the hospital,

895
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:52,507
these men, heroin addicts,

896
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:55,109
would come in with a child.

897
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:58,813
They'd say,
"oh, my son,
he broke his arm."

898
00:56:58,914 --> 00:57:01,749
And while we were
tending to the child,

899
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:04,051
the men would
steal our morphine.

900
00:57:04,053 --> 00:57:08,856
And we would wonder
how the arm got
broken to begin with.

901
00:57:08,858 --> 00:57:11,793
What are we
talking about, fahim?

902
00:57:12,961 --> 00:57:13,327
Hmm.

903
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:17,498
The human body
produces its own heroin.

904
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,067
In fact, when
the fight-or-flight instinct

905
00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:22,036
is activated in
the hypothalamus,

906
00:57:22,038 --> 00:57:28,142
your body releases endorphins,
dopamine and norepinephrine.

907
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:32,647
That is heroin, cocaine
and amphetamine, all at once.

908
00:57:32,649 --> 00:57:36,918
Okay, great. Are we
having the Afghan version
of this conversation,

909
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:37,919
where in New York we would have

910
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:41,322
gotten to the point,
like, five minutes ago?

911
00:57:43,692 --> 00:57:46,060
There is a reason to
believe that a person

912
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:49,330
can get addicted to
this type of high.

913
00:57:49,798 --> 00:57:52,400
Soldiers, athletes...

914
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:54,635
War reporters. Got it.

915
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:58,573
An addict always
needs a greater
and greater dosage.

916
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:02,910
And then people
make mistakes,
people get hurt.

917
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:05,780
I get it. You're
a newlywed. I can

918
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:09,250
probably get them
to go up to $125 a day.

919
00:58:16,658 --> 00:58:18,693
Let us have the

920
00:58:18,927 --> 00:58:23,364
American version of
this conversation.

921
00:58:23,465 --> 00:58:24,866
Okay.

922
00:58:25,767 --> 00:58:28,636
I do not want to
work with you anymore.

923
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:31,372
No, okay, wait.
Fahim, I know I fucked up.

924
00:58:31,374 --> 00:58:34,141
I do not think you do.

925
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:35,343
Hear me out.

926
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:36,244
Kim, no.

927
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:41,215
I am now married.
I want to have children.

928
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:42,884
It will not happen again.
It's not gonna...

929
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:49,223
"I ride after a deer
and find myself
chased by a hog.

930
00:58:49,391 --> 00:58:51,659
"I plot to get what I want

931
00:58:52,094 --> 00:58:53,594
"and I end up in prison.

932
00:58:53,596 --> 00:58:57,932
"I dig pits to trap
others and I fall in.

933
00:58:57,934 --> 00:59:01,569
"I should be
suspicious of
what I want."

934
00:59:02,437 --> 00:59:05,106
I don't know what that means.

935
00:59:09,177 --> 00:59:10,745
You do.

936
00:59:17,619 --> 00:59:18,920
Fahim?

937
01:00:01,496 --> 01:00:03,798
I can't breathe in here.

938
01:00:04,266 --> 01:00:06,100
Time to take a walk.

939
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:08,302
I have to go outside.

940
01:00:08,537 --> 01:00:10,972
I have to go home.

941
01:00:35,897 --> 01:00:36,864
Shit.

942
01:00:36,866 --> 01:00:38,733
It's the wrong house.

943
01:00:43,672 --> 01:00:45,339
Oh, shit.

944
01:01:08,497 --> 01:01:10,164
Kim?

945
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:12,500
What the hell are you doing?

946
01:01:16,238 --> 01:01:17,071
Here.

947
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:21,842
Kim, sip that.
Okay? You all right?

948
01:01:22,177 --> 01:01:25,613
Keep sipping that.
You're all right. It's okay.

949
01:01:25,615 --> 01:01:27,348
It's okay. Hey.

950
01:01:27,582 --> 01:01:28,783
Hey, it's all right.

951
01:01:28,785 --> 01:01:31,886
Oi. Now, that there
was a bit of fun.

952
01:01:31,888 --> 01:01:33,220
Are you mental?
Okay, mate...

953
01:01:33,222 --> 01:01:35,056
I'm not your mate.
I'm gonna ask you again,

954
01:01:35,058 --> 01:01:36,023
are you fucking mental?

955
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:37,825
Come on, iain,
it's not his fault.

956
01:01:37,827 --> 01:01:39,126
What's your job again? Hmm?

957
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:40,961
Because if I hadn't
come back to see you lot

958
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:42,163
because I stole a bottle of sake

959
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:43,531
from a Japanese travel writer...

960
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:44,398
Wait, you have sake?

961
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,133
You could've
killed her, "mate!"

962
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:48,335
Oh, fuck off.

963
01:01:48,704 --> 01:01:51,505
Jesus! What the
fuck?

964
01:01:51,507 --> 01:01:53,541
Dude, what the fuck?

965
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:55,910
Did you fucking sucker punch me?

966
01:01:55,912 --> 01:01:57,378
You broke my nose.

967
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,780
You fucking American?
Are you a yank?

968
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:02,383
I'm Canadian, you asshole.
Ugh.

969
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,718
I almost fucked a Canadian?

970
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,821
I'd stay down if i
were you, ya wee cunt.

971
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:09,690
And that's not
a term of affection.

972
01:02:10,425 --> 01:02:12,126
Fuck that.

973
01:02:22,504 --> 01:02:25,072
Oh, god! Mmm.

974
01:02:26,508 --> 01:02:28,175
Ow!

975
01:02:28,177 --> 01:02:28,709
Wait.
Oh, fuck.

976
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:33,380
Iain, don't carry me around.
I'm not a fucking baby.

977
01:02:33,382 --> 01:02:35,883
Ah!
Goddamn it.

978
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:38,085
What the fuck are you doing?

979
01:02:42,157 --> 01:02:44,358
Take it off.
I'm fucking
trying to take it off!

980
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,794
Oh, god, I'm gonna put it
in you so fucking hard,

981
01:02:46,796 --> 01:02:48,429
you're gonna
fucking get it.
Shh. Don't talk.

982
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:49,897
I want everything in your mouth.

983
01:02:49,899 --> 01:02:50,564
Iain, just shut it.

984
01:02:50,566 --> 01:02:53,234
I'll take you
lying down, come on.

985
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:56,103
Do you have one of those
weird little penises?

986
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:58,405
No! This is how
i want to go.

987
01:02:58,407 --> 01:03:01,075
No, I don't want to see myself.

988
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:02,510
Roll off!

989
01:03:02,512 --> 01:03:04,979
Okay, fuck it.

990
01:03:06,582 --> 01:03:09,350
Oh, god, I fucking...

991
01:03:09,352 --> 01:03:09,884
What are you doing?

992
01:03:09,886 --> 01:03:13,020
I'm just putting my fucking
finger in your mouth.

993
01:03:13,022 --> 01:03:13,487
Shh. No!

994
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:16,757
Come on, just put
everything in your mouth.

995
01:03:17,492 --> 01:03:19,160
Do you want me to go?

996
01:03:19,162 --> 01:03:20,661
No.

997
01:03:34,576 --> 01:03:36,677
There's aught like a good shag.

998
01:03:36,679 --> 01:03:39,413
Okay, let's try to
be adults here.

999
01:03:39,415 --> 01:03:40,514
I think we were.

1000
01:03:40,516 --> 01:03:44,285
Obviously this was just
a kabubble thing, right?

1001
01:03:44,287 --> 01:03:45,319
Just a

1002
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:49,056
fun mistake where one
of us had an orgasm.

1003
01:03:49,058 --> 01:03:53,027
I mean, we're both
in a really bad place.
And then you

1004
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:55,162
punched nic.

1005
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:57,698
I don't know.
It's endorphins, right?

1006
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,034
Nope, that's not what this is.

1007
01:04:00,036 --> 01:04:02,136
No, you don't
need to be gallant.

1008
01:04:02,138 --> 01:04:04,305
I'm serious.

1009
01:04:04,806 --> 01:04:08,475
I fancy you, Kim Baker.

1010
01:04:08,977 --> 01:04:09,777
I do.

1011
01:04:09,779 --> 01:04:13,781
Of all the dozens of women
in this country, I chose you.

1012
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:16,016
No, you didn't,
because this is not me.

1013
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:16,884
I would never do this.

1014
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:19,453
Precisely. Because
you're not you anymore.

1015
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:21,755
You're in the kabubble.
You said so yourself.

1016
01:04:21,757 --> 01:04:24,725
Don't fucking hide.

1017
01:04:25,093 --> 01:04:27,761
Kim, you know the frog
in the pot of water?

1018
01:04:27,763 --> 01:04:31,365
You raise
the temperature
bit by bit,

1019
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:33,500
the frog doesn't notice?

1020
01:04:34,069 --> 01:04:35,002
That's what this place

1021
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:37,004
and that's what this job
does to all of us.

1022
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:41,575
It changes your perception
of what's normal until...

1023
01:04:42,978 --> 01:04:45,179
until here we are.

1024
01:04:45,814 --> 01:04:47,348
You know the frog boils to death

1025
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:49,383
at the end of that, right?
Nope.

1026
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:51,018
Yeah.
Nope.

1027
01:04:57,626 --> 01:05:00,127
Is that my toothbrush?

1028
01:05:00,295 --> 01:05:01,595
Ugh!

1029
01:05:01,597 --> 01:05:04,865
What's going on
with my kandahar piece, ed?

1030
01:05:04,867 --> 01:05:06,400
Jerry killed it.

1031
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:07,134
Wait, who killed it?

1032
01:05:07,136 --> 01:05:09,670
Jerry Taub,
head of the network, Kim.

1033
01:05:09,672 --> 01:05:11,372
What happened to Angela?
She left.

1034
01:05:11,374 --> 01:05:14,608
She's running a website
for women or something.

1035
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:18,479
Look, I can't sell
Afghanistan in
Monday meetings.

1036
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:22,116
Your war's got chronic
same-shit-different-day-itis.

1037
01:05:22,118 --> 01:05:24,585
Great. What am i
even doing here, ed?

1038
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:27,655
I wouldn't ask
that too loudly, Kim.

1039
01:05:27,657 --> 01:05:32,393
Though I'd be thrilled to have
you back at your old desk.

1040
01:05:37,732 --> 01:05:39,733
That's all I got.

1041
01:05:42,203 --> 01:05:46,173
Hey, I heard that nic quit
and you fucked iain!

1042
01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:46,840
Whoa, hold on.

1043
01:05:46,842 --> 01:05:49,310
Listen, the iain thing
is not a thing, okay?

1044
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:51,345
We have the same
size hands. I can't.

1045
01:05:51,347 --> 01:05:54,548
It's just work has been
a little frustrating.

1046
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:55,182
Yeah. I get it.

1047
01:05:55,184 --> 01:05:57,551
Because Afghanistan
doesn't rate anymore.

1048
01:05:57,553 --> 01:05:58,552
That is bullshit.

1049
01:05:58,554 --> 01:06:00,788
You've got to find
your own luck here, babe,

1050
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,423
you know that.

1051
01:06:05,126 --> 01:06:06,627
What?

1052
01:06:07,395 --> 01:06:08,495
What? What is that?

1053
01:06:08,497 --> 01:06:11,365
Hey! You're hooking up
Tanya in the tribals?

1054
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:12,633
What the fuck, jaweed?

1055
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:13,934
Her network will pay me triple.

1056
01:06:13,936 --> 01:06:16,337
I taught you how to clear
your Internet history, okay?

1057
01:06:16,339 --> 01:06:18,272
What has vanderpoel
ever done for you?

1058
01:06:18,274 --> 01:06:19,273
Give me a break, man.

1059
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:21,942
Whatever. You owe me.
What else do you have?

1060
01:06:21,944 --> 01:06:22,843
You're ghilzai, right?

1061
01:06:22,845 --> 01:06:24,411
Do you have any
other connections

1062
01:06:24,413 --> 01:06:25,879
to members of
the ghilzai family?

1063
01:06:25,881 --> 01:06:27,448
You mean hekmatyar?
Maybe.

1064
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:30,117
Are you fucking
crazy, Kim? Please.

1065
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:33,020
Hey! Nabil! Hey.

1066
01:06:33,022 --> 01:06:34,955
Are you still in touch
with that isi guy

1067
01:06:34,957 --> 01:06:37,558
who says he knows
who killed Abdul haq?

1068
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:40,894
That guy?
He's dead two years.

1069
01:06:54,642 --> 01:06:55,909
Hey.

1070
01:07:03,952 --> 01:07:06,020
Oh, for fuck's sake.

1071
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,788
Mrs. mackelpie.

1072
01:07:12,027 --> 01:07:12,693
Twice?

1073
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:14,128
Two and a half, actually.

1074
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:15,162
Ugh!

1075
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:17,831
I don't remember
what happened last night.

1076
01:07:17,833 --> 01:07:19,933
Kabul happened,
my wee froggy in the pot.

1077
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:22,803
Did I not wear
a headscarf?
Where's my phone?

1078
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:24,738
I believe I threw your
mobile in my cupboard.

1079
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:25,239
Why?

1080
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:27,241
Because mid-coitus
you tried to call Tanya

1081
01:07:27,243 --> 01:07:30,077
about some bloody
wild goose chase
in the tribals.

1082
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:31,111
I told you about that?

1083
01:07:31,113 --> 01:07:32,046
Mmm. Well, it was hard
to understand you

1084
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:35,749
once you asked me
to stuff your knickers
in your mouth.

1085
01:07:36,484 --> 01:07:38,619
I'm joking, Kim.
That didn't happen.

1086
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:40,487
Fuck. I am...

1087
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:42,856
I am fucking losing it.

1088
01:07:43,058 --> 01:07:44,191
I need a win.

1089
01:07:44,193 --> 01:07:45,125
Christ, if you're that hard up,

1090
01:07:45,127 --> 01:07:47,494
I'll share my badakhshan
thing with you.

1091
01:07:47,496 --> 01:07:48,295
What badakhshan thing?

1092
01:07:48,297 --> 01:07:51,165
You know China
won the contract to
mine for gold up there.

1093
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:53,734
They built roads, airport,
housing, all that.

1094
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:55,936
Well, guess whose
responsibility it is

1095
01:07:55,938 --> 01:07:58,305
to protect
the investment
of red China

1096
01:07:58,307 --> 01:08:00,007
in this restive nation?

1097
01:08:00,009 --> 01:08:04,378
American troops, Chinese gold.
Oh, iain, that's really good.

1098
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:05,212
People are gonna get mad.

1099
01:08:05,214 --> 01:08:06,814
Just waiting for
my guy to give me
the green light.

1100
01:08:06,816 --> 01:08:10,084
You pay for the trip,
I'll share the story
with you. Easy peasy.

1101
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:13,387
Really? Thank you. That's...

1102
01:08:14,022 --> 01:08:14,888
I owe you one.

1103
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:17,591
Well, how about a half of one?

1104
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:19,026
And then we can
make it an even three.

1105
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:21,695
Yeah. Or I could
buy you breakfast.

1106
01:08:21,697 --> 01:08:24,331
Or a half of one
and we can make
it an even three.

1107
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:27,768
I think breakfast is of
equal monetary value.

1108
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,770
My middle name is eoghan.

1109
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:32,106
Which is erse... shut up.

1110
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,807
It's erse for Owen.

1111
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:34,975
"Oo-hee"?
Mmm-hmm.

1112
01:08:34,977 --> 01:08:37,244
Iain "oo-hee."
Don't bother.

1113
01:08:37,246 --> 01:08:38,145
Where is bin laden?

1114
01:08:38,147 --> 01:08:39,913
People think he's
in Pakistan, right?

1115
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:40,414
Yeah.

1116
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:42,683
You've got egg in
your beard. Hang on.

1117
01:08:42,685 --> 01:08:43,417
Thank you.

1118
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:46,487
Your national animal
is the unicorn.

1119
01:08:46,489 --> 01:08:47,054
I think it's romantic.

1120
01:08:47,056 --> 01:08:49,490
That is the national animal
of the kingdom I ruled

1121
01:08:49,492 --> 01:08:50,591
when I was eight.

1122
01:08:50,593 --> 01:08:52,593
Who's your
favorite three stooge?

1123
01:08:52,595 --> 01:08:56,897
Um, Larry. Because
he's put upon in a way
that I identify with.

1124
01:08:56,899 --> 01:09:00,200
He's the art Garfunkel, right?

1125
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:00,634
Yeah.

1126
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:04,538
So, I thought I might
like to hang out
with you for a bit.

1127
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:06,640
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

1128
01:09:06,741 --> 01:09:08,876
Do you really want to
know what I want to do?

1129
01:09:08,878 --> 01:09:09,743
Yeah. Okay.

1130
01:09:09,745 --> 01:09:11,612
I'd like to kiss you.

1131
01:09:14,716 --> 01:09:16,216
Who knew?

1132
01:09:19,988 --> 01:09:21,221
Here's my little man.

1133
01:09:21,223 --> 01:09:23,457
No, iain, don't. It's a scam.

1134
01:09:23,459 --> 01:09:25,692
Do you think so? Really?

1135
01:09:25,694 --> 01:09:28,061
I know it's a scam,
Kim. So what?

1136
01:09:28,063 --> 01:09:31,131
He's still
begging in the street.
Hey, abrahaim.

1137
01:09:31,533 --> 01:09:33,400
There's my boy.

1138
01:09:43,578 --> 01:09:45,946
I knew I'd win you over.

1139
01:09:51,319 --> 01:09:52,686
Jesus!

1140
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:02,763
What the fuck, jaweed?
Are they coming or not?

1141
01:10:03,064 --> 01:10:04,498
Here they are.

1142
01:10:09,370 --> 01:10:10,971
There they are.

1143
01:10:10,973 --> 01:10:15,309
4-6800, line six north.

1144
01:10:19,581 --> 01:10:21,081
Standing by approval.

1145
01:10:21,083 --> 01:10:22,783
We are clear to engage target.

1146
01:10:22,785 --> 01:10:25,452
Roger. Clear to
engage target.

1147
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:34,761
It is him. That's my guy.

1148
01:10:34,763 --> 01:10:37,197
If we go anywhere,
jaweed, we take our vehicle.

1149
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:38,232
No carpooling.

1150
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:39,933
All right. Okay.

1151
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:50,043
Shit! Shit!

1152
01:10:50,478 --> 01:10:51,812
Stay calm.

1153
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:00,120
Splash.

1154
01:11:00,122 --> 01:11:01,388
Cease laser. Safe laser.

1155
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:03,557
Laser off. Laser safe.

1156
01:11:27,049 --> 01:11:30,117
I'm looking for
someone. Excuse me.

1157
01:11:36,924 --> 01:11:39,026
Oh, my god. Tanya.
Hi.

1158
01:11:39,028 --> 01:11:40,827
Jesus.
Oy.

1159
01:11:42,130 --> 01:11:44,031
Jaweed's dead.

1160
01:11:44,033 --> 01:11:45,265
Andy's in surgery.

1161
01:11:45,267 --> 01:11:47,134
I know. Iain
talked to Colin.

1162
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:48,302
Jesus!

1163
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,203
I know. It's fucked.

1164
01:11:51,973 --> 01:11:54,541
You know, Colin was rolling.

1165
01:11:55,076 --> 01:11:57,644
What, like, rolling-rolling?
You have tape?

1166
01:11:57,646 --> 01:11:59,146
He got the whole fucking thing.

1167
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:03,483
I'm going to go live
with it as soon as
they let me out of here.

1168
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:07,187
Can you fucking believe it?

1169
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:09,022
Hey.

1170
01:12:09,024 --> 01:12:10,490
Hi.

1171
01:12:10,758 --> 01:12:11,958
Aye.

1172
01:12:12,193 --> 01:12:13,894
- How are you?
- You doing all right?

1173
01:12:15,731 --> 01:12:17,064
Holy shit!

1174
01:12:17,066 --> 01:12:18,732
And as we watch it
again there, Susanna,

1175
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:23,203
you can actually see
the hellfire missile
right before it detonates.

1176
01:12:27,608 --> 01:12:29,409
What is going on
with badakhshan?

1177
01:12:29,411 --> 01:12:31,578
Ah, snow's killing us.

1178
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:32,546
So unless your network wants

1179
01:12:32,548 --> 01:12:34,281
to stump up the money
for the helicopter,

1180
01:12:34,283 --> 01:12:36,750
we'll have to wait till
they clear the passes.

1181
01:12:36,752 --> 01:12:39,052
Kim, we have a bit
of a situation outside.

1182
01:12:39,054 --> 01:12:40,253
Oh.

1183
01:12:40,488 --> 01:12:41,154
What?

1184
01:12:41,156 --> 01:12:43,357
I just need you
to see something.

1185
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:44,624
Sorry to interrupt.

1186
01:12:44,626 --> 01:12:46,159
Did he say what he wanted?

1187
01:12:46,161 --> 01:12:47,794
I don't know.

1188
01:12:51,999 --> 01:12:53,166
Fuck.

1189
01:12:57,205 --> 01:12:59,706
Qadar. Qadar,
it's okay. You can go in.

1190
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:01,174
He just wants to talk to me.

1191
01:13:01,176 --> 01:13:02,642
Okay. Okay.
It's okay.

1192
01:13:02,644 --> 01:13:05,545
Oh, please, do not cover
your hair on my account.

1193
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:06,780
It's such beautiful hair.

1194
01:13:06,782 --> 01:13:09,116
It's like the hide
of a fine horse.

1195
01:13:09,118 --> 01:13:12,285
Sadiq, what are you doing here?

1196
01:13:12,453 --> 01:13:16,623
I was just going home
from closing a woman brothel

1197
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:18,058
when I told my driver,

1198
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:22,829
"mahboobullah, this is
where my best friend
Kimberly lives!"

1199
01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:27,134
But she has been
a bad friend lately.

1200
01:13:27,869 --> 01:13:30,003
She does not call.

1201
01:13:30,005 --> 01:13:33,373
She does not
invite me to her party.

1202
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:34,207
I'm sorry,

1203
01:13:34,209 --> 01:13:36,510
but I didn't think
the Attorney General

1204
01:13:36,512 --> 01:13:38,779
of the islamic
Republic of Afghanistan

1205
01:13:38,781 --> 01:13:40,580
went to parties at guesthouses.

1206
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:42,215
And why not?

1207
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:44,518
I am still a man, no?

1208
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,353
I love music.

1209
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:49,322
I love to dance!

1210
01:13:59,567 --> 01:14:00,767
But

1211
01:14:00,902 --> 01:14:04,337
even though
you have been
a bad friend,

1212
01:14:04,872 --> 01:14:06,940
I want you to be happy.

1213
01:14:08,009 --> 01:14:10,744
Do you have a special friend?

1214
01:14:11,546 --> 01:14:13,180
Because

1215
01:14:14,148 --> 01:14:17,851
I would love to be
your special friend.

1216
01:14:18,853 --> 01:14:20,954
Would you like that, Kim?

1217
01:14:23,491 --> 01:14:25,325
You're a bad friend.

1218
01:14:25,693 --> 01:14:27,294
You are a bad friend.

1219
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:31,765
In America, I would get
a book deal out of this shit!

1220
01:14:31,767 --> 01:14:33,733
You can't just do this, okay?

1221
01:14:33,735 --> 01:14:35,602
I haven't been on
the air in months!

1222
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:40,574
My best friend
here almost died,
and I am jealous of her!

1223
01:14:40,576 --> 01:14:42,476
And I am just...

1224
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:45,879
Fuck this! All of it!

1225
01:15:09,638 --> 01:15:11,438
That was a bomb.

1226
01:15:12,874 --> 01:15:13,940
Hello! So, wait!

1227
01:15:13,942 --> 01:15:16,543
Who is fronting the show?

1228
01:15:16,545 --> 01:15:17,744
Tucker? No, I don't
know who that is.

1229
01:15:17,746 --> 01:15:21,348
Okay, well, I could go
live for the overnights,
but this is...

1230
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:25,852
"Satellite time?"
No, I have a
dedicated feed.

1231
01:15:26,787 --> 01:15:27,921
Since when?

1232
01:15:27,923 --> 01:15:29,389
This is Tucker wang.

1233
01:15:29,391 --> 01:15:30,056
This is Kim Baker.

1234
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:32,726
Why am I being told that
i don't have a sat hookup?

1235
01:15:32,728 --> 01:15:34,761
Because you're on
the hourly plan now.

1236
01:15:34,763 --> 01:15:36,863
And either way,
the show is full tonight.

1237
01:15:36,865 --> 01:15:37,764
No. Who is your boss?

1238
01:15:37,766 --> 01:15:39,933
I want to talk to
this Jerry whatever, Taub.

1239
01:15:39,935 --> 01:15:42,602
Okay, look, Jerry has
mentioned Afghanistan
to me once,

1240
01:15:42,604 --> 01:15:44,604
and mentioned it to know why
the only good story to come

1241
01:15:44,606 --> 01:15:46,573
out of there in a year
was on another network.

1242
01:15:46,575 --> 01:15:49,209
What, Tanya's thing?
No, I've got shit like that.

1243
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:51,211
I'm waiting for
the snow to melt!

1244
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:52,012
I want to talk to Jerry.

1245
01:15:52,014 --> 01:15:54,180
If I could just get
you to get me a story

1246
01:15:54,182 --> 01:15:55,782
that somebody would care about,

1247
01:15:55,784 --> 01:15:57,551
it would be fine.
But meanwhile...

1248
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:58,351
Okay, what if i come to New York

1249
01:15:58,353 --> 01:16:00,487
and I burst into
Jerry's office?
How about that?

1250
01:16:00,489 --> 01:16:02,689
Well, that might look
like I hadn't done my job.

1251
01:16:02,691 --> 01:16:05,058
Perfect. See you Wednesday.

1252
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:06,259
Cunt.

1253
01:16:09,664 --> 01:16:12,098
Kim.

1254
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:15,135
Kim, look at these dogs.

1255
01:16:15,970 --> 01:16:17,337
How does this end?

1256
01:16:17,339 --> 01:16:20,106
A bucket of cold water,
i suppose.

1257
01:16:23,578 --> 01:16:24,377
No.

1258
01:16:24,379 --> 01:16:26,413
Um...

1259
01:16:27,949 --> 01:16:29,816
How does this

1260
01:16:30,685 --> 01:16:32,319
end?

1261
01:16:33,888 --> 01:16:37,591
Uh, I don't really know, Kim.

1262
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:41,928
We grow old together?
Get a cottage in the country?

1263
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:43,563
Raise chickens?

1264
01:16:43,565 --> 01:16:44,931
Eat scrambled eggs
off each other?

1265
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:48,168
Look, we're good, aren't we?
We'll always have Kabul.

1266
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:50,270
No, we won't.
We won't "always have" it

1267
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:51,771
because I have to go home.

1268
01:16:51,773 --> 01:16:52,839
No, this is home.

1269
01:16:52,841 --> 01:16:56,943
I have to go to
New York City
and justify my life

1270
01:16:56,945 --> 01:16:58,745
to somebody named Jerry

1271
01:16:58,747 --> 01:17:01,848
before he takes
it all away, and I

1272
01:17:02,583 --> 01:17:07,921
cannot go back to sitting
at a goddamn desk. I can't.

1273
01:17:07,923 --> 01:17:09,422
Aye. Listen...

1274
01:17:09,424 --> 01:17:12,158
No one can take
it away from you.

1275
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:12,993
Not all of it.

1276
01:17:12,995 --> 01:17:15,462
Whatever happens,
you'll have me.

1277
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:19,399
That's a very nice
thing to say, but...

1278
01:17:19,401 --> 01:17:20,867
But what?

1279
01:17:31,245 --> 01:17:36,049
Following
a fatal traffic accident
involving a coalition truck,

1280
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:37,017
long simmering frustration

1281
01:17:37,019 --> 01:17:41,221
today boiled over
into violence and despair.

1282
01:17:41,223 --> 01:17:42,255
They kill us!

1283
01:17:42,257 --> 01:17:44,057
They kill us and
they break our hearts!

1284
01:17:44,059 --> 01:17:47,093
And I also give this message
to president Hamid karzai:

1285
01:17:47,095 --> 01:17:50,430
What the hell is happening here?

1286
01:18:09,817 --> 01:18:12,519
Okay, I don't care
who the hell's in there.
I'm Kim Baker.

1287
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:15,088
Go on in, Kim.
Jerry's expecting you.

1288
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:17,957
Well, that's
fucking unsatisfying.

1289
01:18:17,959 --> 01:18:19,492
Can I take your bag?

1290
01:18:19,494 --> 01:18:21,161
Yes. Please.

1291
01:18:21,562 --> 01:18:23,163
Would you care for some water?

1292
01:18:23,165 --> 01:18:24,464
Yes.

1293
01:18:35,142 --> 01:18:35,742
I should've googled you.

1294
01:18:35,744 --> 01:18:40,346
I've been... I've been
using all the wrong
swear words.

1295
01:18:40,614 --> 01:18:42,782
Well, I hope
i didn't ruin
your big moment.

1296
01:18:42,784 --> 01:18:45,318
Look, geri, I don't know what
Tucker has been telling you.

1297
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:48,221
He said that you're
upset about the air
time you're getting.

1298
01:18:48,223 --> 01:18:51,858
That's just wrong,
because this is
not about me.

1299
01:18:51,860 --> 01:18:54,060
My frustration is
with our priorities

1300
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:56,629
and what's best for the network.

1301
01:18:56,631 --> 01:19:00,166
Isn't deciding what's best
for the network my job?

1302
01:19:01,535 --> 01:19:02,936
I'm just saying,

1303
01:19:02,938 --> 01:19:05,405
as journalists, we have
an obligation to this story.

1304
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:09,309
And Afghanistan should be
on our air more, period.

1305
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:10,744
With the resources
we have over there,

1306
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:13,279
Afghanistan should
definitely be
on our air more.

1307
01:19:13,281 --> 01:19:17,183
But the problem is,
as much as everyone
loves the troops,

1308
01:19:17,185 --> 01:19:21,654
they don't actually
want to watch them
on the news anymore.

1309
01:19:21,656 --> 01:19:22,689
They just don't.

1310
01:19:22,691 --> 01:19:25,391
So I can't give
Afghanistan more air.

1311
01:19:25,393 --> 01:19:29,662
Which means I need
to give Afghanistan
fewer resources.

1312
01:19:29,664 --> 01:19:32,899
That's what's
best for the network.

1313
01:19:32,901 --> 01:19:34,434
Geri...

1314
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:36,035
You have that call now.

1315
01:19:38,439 --> 01:19:39,973
I'm not trying to be a bitch.

1316
01:19:39,975 --> 01:19:41,074
Okay, let me
pitch you something.

1317
01:19:41,076 --> 01:19:43,009
All right, the Chinese
mining concession...

1318
01:19:43,011 --> 01:19:43,443
Jesus!

1319
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:45,145
Look, the last person
who got any kind of

1320
01:19:45,147 --> 01:19:46,513
bounce out of Afghanistan

1321
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:47,981
was your friend
Tanya vanderpoel.

1322
01:19:47,983 --> 01:19:52,085
She's actually
got me over a barrel
thanks to that drone story.

1323
01:19:52,087 --> 01:19:54,020
What do you mean,
"over a barrel"?

1324
01:19:54,022 --> 01:19:55,789
She's London, Kim.

1325
01:19:56,891 --> 01:19:59,492
You're hiring Tanya.
Yes.

1326
01:20:00,194 --> 01:20:02,762
I assumed you two
flew here together.

1327
01:20:04,331 --> 01:20:06,032
She's here.

1328
01:20:07,969 --> 01:20:13,006
I'm sorry, you started
talking to her before
the uav strike?

1329
01:20:13,008 --> 01:20:14,974
Is uav a drone?

1330
01:20:16,477 --> 01:20:17,710
Hello! Where are you going?

1331
01:20:17,712 --> 01:20:20,980
No, I'm only here
for a few days.

1332
01:20:21,115 --> 01:20:22,982
Oh, I know.

1333
01:20:24,718 --> 01:20:26,085
Oh, fuck.

1334
01:20:26,087 --> 01:20:27,754
I don't know what to say to you.

1335
01:20:27,756 --> 01:20:30,089
Ducky, I'm sorry.
I fucked up.

1336
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:31,391
Did you go to the tribals

1337
01:20:31,393 --> 01:20:33,092
because you were in
a contract negotiation?

1338
01:20:33,094 --> 01:20:35,461
Dude, I'm not
stealing your job, okay?

1339
01:20:35,463 --> 01:20:39,165
Tanya, this is not
about my fucking job.

1340
01:20:39,567 --> 01:20:41,134
We have to make
good calls, right?

1341
01:20:41,136 --> 01:20:44,070
And now Andy lost an eye
and jaweed is dead.

1342
01:20:44,072 --> 01:20:46,372
Christ, man, we've both
fucking made mistakes!

1343
01:20:46,374 --> 01:20:50,543
No. Tell me you
didn't go to the tribals
because of a contract.

1344
01:20:50,545 --> 01:20:54,647
You would have done
exactly what I did
if jaweed had gone to you.

1345
01:20:54,649 --> 01:20:56,683
No. I'm not you.

1346
01:21:02,389 --> 01:21:05,225
Do you remember
your first embed?

1347
01:21:05,726 --> 01:21:08,228
You interviewed a young marine?

1348
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:08,928
Coughlin? Yes. What?

1349
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:12,165
Yeah, well, after they
aired your story,

1350
01:21:12,167 --> 01:21:17,003
where you used
his soundbite about
not loading his rifle,

1351
01:21:17,005 --> 01:21:19,539
they sent him to helmand.

1352
01:21:19,607 --> 01:21:22,242
And he got his legs blown off.

1353
01:21:22,910 --> 01:21:24,544
So I hear.

1354
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:31,718
See you in Kabul.

1355
01:22:00,547 --> 01:22:04,083
I'm not really surprised
she chased the story.

1356
01:22:04,085 --> 01:22:06,452
That's what we do.
That's what you do.

1357
01:22:06,454 --> 01:22:07,854
I would do it.

1358
01:22:10,591 --> 01:22:11,991
Sorry.

1359
01:22:11,993 --> 01:22:14,661
Goddamn it, I'm tired.

1360
01:22:14,663 --> 01:22:15,561
You booked your return yet?

1361
01:22:15,563 --> 01:22:17,897
'Cause you could come through
Glasgow if you wanted.

1362
01:22:17,899 --> 01:22:18,998
I'll meet you.
What?

1363
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,767
No. What about badakhshan?

1364
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:22,035
Badakhshan, that will keep

1365
01:22:22,037 --> 01:22:24,304
because the fucking pass
is still snowed in.

1366
01:22:24,306 --> 01:22:27,473
I need that story.
I need a hit, all right?

1367
01:22:27,475 --> 01:22:29,542
I need something
so that geri doesn't decide

1368
01:22:29,544 --> 01:22:31,644
I'm more useful as
an ottoman in
her fucking office.

1369
01:22:31,646 --> 01:22:34,681
What you need, Kim,
is some time
out of the bubble.

1370
01:22:34,683 --> 01:22:37,684
You'd better get ready.
I'm fucking
making love to you

1371
01:22:37,686 --> 01:22:41,354
to bagpipe versions
of sade songs.

1372
01:22:43,123 --> 01:22:44,157
Yeah, okay.

1373
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:46,659
Really? You'll meet
me in Glasgow?

1374
01:22:46,794 --> 01:22:49,195
Yeah, I'll meet you in Glasgow.

1375
01:22:49,197 --> 01:22:51,564
I'll get the next flight.
Okay.

1376
01:22:51,566 --> 01:22:54,033
Bye.
Bye.

1377
01:23:03,243 --> 01:23:03,776
Hey, Antoine.

1378
01:23:03,778 --> 01:23:07,613
Where have you come from?
I thought you
were in badakhshan.

1379
01:23:07,615 --> 01:23:10,450
I was. Drove
back overnight.

1380
01:23:10,452 --> 01:23:12,719
Wait, what?
The pass is open?

1381
01:23:12,721 --> 01:23:14,988
Oui. For now.

1382
01:23:28,769 --> 01:23:30,136
Cheers.

1383
01:23:50,991 --> 01:23:52,925
Oh, Christ.

1384
01:24:10,044 --> 01:24:11,511
Mmm-hmm.

1385
01:24:14,848 --> 01:24:15,882
Aye, thank you.

1386
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:19,118
Yeah, I get it.
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

1387
01:24:43,143 --> 01:24:45,078
Oh, Jesus.

1388
01:24:45,279 --> 01:24:47,180
Oh, shit.

1389
01:24:54,955 --> 01:24:58,658
Welcome to
Glasgow international airport.

1390
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:01,761
Outside temperature's
18 degrees celsius.

1391
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:03,429
Local time is 15 hours.

1392
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:06,766
There will be
an airline representative
to assist you to your luggage.

1393
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:09,902
Once again, thank you
for flying with us...

1394
01:25:10,838 --> 01:25:12,772
Oh, my god.

1395
01:25:24,551 --> 01:25:25,751
Leaving a message for Susan.

1396
01:25:25,753 --> 01:25:27,987
Woodward,
I'm back in Kabul again.

1397
01:25:27,989 --> 01:25:29,489
I'm trying to get
information about

1398
01:25:29,491 --> 01:25:30,389
the disappearance
of iain mackelpie,

1399
01:25:30,391 --> 01:25:32,592
so if someone at reuters
can please call me back.

1400
01:25:32,594 --> 01:25:35,261
Call to let me know
that you've
received this message.

1401
01:25:35,263 --> 01:25:36,829
Thank you.

1402
01:25:52,913 --> 01:25:54,847
Who kidnaps a Scottish
freelance photographer?

1403
01:25:54,849 --> 01:25:57,917
The whole point
of kidnapping is
to get money, right?

1404
01:25:57,919 --> 01:25:58,651
As far as I understand,

1405
01:25:58,653 --> 01:26:00,586
iain was just in
the wrong place
at the wrong time.

1406
01:26:00,588 --> 01:26:03,422
Can this half-assed
country not even do
kidnapping right?

1407
01:26:03,424 --> 01:26:06,459
Isaf does not think
this was an
upper-tier organization.

1408
01:26:06,461 --> 01:26:09,562
So these men will
probably try to sell
him to someone else.

1409
01:26:09,564 --> 01:26:12,965
And then there
will be some talking,
you know.

1410
01:26:12,967 --> 01:26:16,135
Oh, my god, fahim.
They're gonna kill him.

1411
01:26:16,236 --> 01:26:18,237
No, they will not, Kim,

1412
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:20,006
inshallah.

1413
01:26:21,308 --> 01:26:25,545
Now is when you're supposed
to say "i told you so."

1414
01:26:34,988 --> 01:26:36,589
Fuck!

1415
01:26:43,664 --> 01:26:48,100
Ramadan has ended.
They are slaughtering lambs.

1416
01:27:07,588 --> 01:27:08,821
May I speak with him?

1417
01:27:08,823 --> 01:27:10,323
The general's busy.

1418
01:27:13,527 --> 01:27:16,262
Really, general?
The elliptical?

1419
01:27:16,396 --> 01:27:18,598
I have bad knees.

1420
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:23,502
I'm guessing you
didn't come here
for the smell of balls.

1421
01:27:23,504 --> 01:27:26,072
Everybody get the fuck out!

1422
01:27:30,777 --> 01:27:33,045
They believe that
he may have been sold

1423
01:27:33,047 --> 01:27:34,513
to another organization

1424
01:27:34,515 --> 01:27:37,049
somewhere in that same region.

1425
01:27:40,287 --> 01:27:43,389
That's a pretty big ask, Baker.

1426
01:27:44,224 --> 01:27:47,159
There's a real-time
clock on this.

1427
01:27:48,028 --> 01:27:50,696
I'm sorry, i can't help you.

1428
01:27:58,672 --> 01:28:00,806
You know, it's just a shame that

1429
01:28:00,808 --> 01:28:02,775
y'all don't get
credit for all these

1430
01:28:02,777 --> 01:28:04,277
high-profile
things that you do.

1431
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:07,013
You know, especially with
seals and delta out there.

1432
01:28:07,015 --> 01:28:08,547
I mean, what week
goes by that you don't see

1433
01:28:08,549 --> 01:28:11,617
those assholes
on TV, am I right?

1434
01:28:11,818 --> 01:28:15,388
And then next
time congress votes
on a Pentagon budget

1435
01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:19,125
and there's this pesky little
10% line item for the marines,

1436
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:22,628
next thing you know,
you guys are just
part of the Navy.

1437
01:28:22,630 --> 01:28:24,430
Although, sir,
you would look
spectacular

1438
01:28:24,432 --> 01:28:27,099
in one of those
pretty white uniforms.

1439
01:28:31,471 --> 01:28:33,272
God, you know what?

1440
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:36,208
It's just occurring to me
that, unlike jsoc,

1441
01:28:36,210 --> 01:28:37,977
you guys allow reporter embeds.

1442
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:42,581
Which means that
a cameraman could go
on a forecon mission.

1443
01:28:42,583 --> 01:28:46,719
Don't you think that would be
great for the corps, sir?

1444
01:28:46,721 --> 01:28:49,055
That kind of exposure?

1445
01:28:50,023 --> 01:28:52,124
Pretty good for you, too.

1446
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:54,293
Look, we don't go in blind.

1447
01:28:54,295 --> 01:28:57,430
We have to know
what we're doing
and where we're going.

1448
01:28:57,432 --> 01:28:58,564
It's the way we work.

1449
01:28:58,566 --> 01:29:01,500
We're not likely to
get an address, but...

1450
01:29:01,502 --> 01:29:03,002
When you have
something concrete,

1451
01:29:03,004 --> 01:29:05,137
come back and we'll get kinetic.

1452
01:29:10,644 --> 01:29:12,678
Ugh!

1453
01:29:14,748 --> 01:29:18,617
Please tell Mr. sadiq
that his "special
friend" is here.

1454
01:29:18,619 --> 01:29:21,020
What can I get
for you? Some tea?
The new PlayStation?

1455
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:25,091
No, thank you. I just need
a moment of your time.
Ah.

1456
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:28,728
We still friends, sadiq?

1457
01:29:28,730 --> 01:29:31,997
Well, that is up to you, Kim.

1458
01:29:31,999 --> 01:29:33,399
Because you once told me

1459
01:29:33,401 --> 01:29:36,569
that nothing happens here
that you don't know about.

1460
01:29:36,571 --> 01:29:38,738
So you must know about my friend

1461
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:41,006
iain mackelpie
getting kidnapped.

1462
01:29:41,008 --> 01:29:41,874
I did hear about this, yes.

1463
01:29:41,876 --> 01:29:42,775
Yeah, well, everybody
heard about it,

1464
01:29:42,777 --> 01:29:47,646
but a powerful man
such as yourself must
actually know something.

1465
01:29:47,648 --> 01:29:50,282
Or your friend pacha Khan
knows something.

1466
01:29:50,284 --> 01:29:51,851
Or his friend does.

1467
01:29:51,853 --> 01:29:52,218
Of course.

1468
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:55,921
I could make some inquiries,
but I can only do this

1469
01:29:55,923 --> 01:29:58,657
for a very special friend.

1470
01:30:16,276 --> 01:30:19,612
I have a video that I think
you should watch, sadiq.

1471
01:30:19,614 --> 01:30:22,748
You push the little triangle.

1472
01:30:23,016 --> 01:30:26,252
You can watch
video on the phone?

1473
01:30:29,556 --> 01:30:31,157
What is this?

1474
01:30:31,992 --> 01:30:33,959
It looks like
the Attorney General

1475
01:30:33,961 --> 01:30:36,262
of the islamic
Republic of Afghanistan

1476
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:37,496
dancing in the street

1477
01:30:37,498 --> 01:30:39,799
with a western enemy of islam

1478
01:30:39,801 --> 01:30:42,535
at a party where
alcohol was served.

1479
01:30:42,769 --> 01:30:44,403
I've never touched
alcohol in my life!

1480
01:30:44,405 --> 01:30:47,106
Well, I'm just saying
how it looks.

1481
01:30:54,515 --> 01:30:57,049
It's a good idea, right?

1482
01:30:57,617 --> 01:30:59,885
It's a great idea!

1483
01:31:00,287 --> 01:31:01,821
It's fucking Ace!

1484
01:31:04,090 --> 01:31:06,058
Good on ya, Kim!

1485
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:11,163
Let's go, load up!
Let's go, move, move, move!

1486
01:31:23,310 --> 01:31:26,979
You drink Tennessee whiskey,
miss Baker?

1487
01:31:27,881 --> 01:31:29,148
Yeah.

1488
01:31:31,384 --> 01:31:33,285
Outstanding.

1489
01:33:19,859 --> 01:33:22,061
Tall Brian? What the fuck?

1490
01:33:34,374 --> 01:33:36,875
Hang tight, sir.
I'm gonna get you
that ride.

1491
01:33:36,877 --> 01:33:38,911
Thank you.

1492
01:33:42,382 --> 01:33:45,784
What happened
to the army, Dr. brydon?

1493
01:33:48,356 --> 01:33:50,222
I am the army.

1494
01:33:54,928 --> 01:33:56,662
Thank you, Kim.

1495
01:33:56,664 --> 01:33:58,197
How are you?

1496
01:33:58,199 --> 01:33:59,999
I've had worse kidnappings.

1497
01:34:02,602 --> 01:34:05,804
Mackelpie is being
treated for minor injuries.

1498
01:34:05,806 --> 01:34:07,206
Again, this incredible footage

1499
01:34:07,208 --> 01:34:09,441
was produced
by our very own Kim Baker.

1500
01:34:09,443 --> 01:34:12,478
Just incredible.
Way to go, Kim!

1501
01:34:12,646 --> 01:34:16,882
If you want to kidnap
someone fucking twice,

1502
01:34:16,884 --> 01:34:17,549
you do a Toyota.

1503
01:34:17,551 --> 01:34:19,418
Fucking not as
interesting as it got

1504
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:21,387
when they fucking
pulled out a burqa.

1505
01:34:21,389 --> 01:34:22,554
It's too fucking long for me!

1506
01:34:22,556 --> 01:34:24,490
I don't know who
the woman was
it belonged to.

1507
01:34:24,492 --> 01:34:26,158
I'm not fucking 6'2", right?

1508
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:27,793
I'm dragging this
fucking thing along,

1509
01:34:27,795 --> 01:34:29,294
thinking
the only consolation is,

1510
01:34:29,296 --> 01:34:31,330
at least if I'm a fucking woman,

1511
01:34:31,332 --> 01:34:34,833
I'm not gonna get buggered,
you know what I'm saying?

1512
01:34:40,807 --> 01:34:43,142
So anyway, I took
a little something,
actually.

1513
01:34:43,144 --> 01:34:45,010
I went to
the gift shop at Taliban.

1514
01:34:45,012 --> 01:34:46,712
I'm afraid all I could get

1515
01:34:46,714 --> 01:34:48,514
was that.

1516
01:35:11,938 --> 01:35:14,173
It's a shame you're going.
Hmm?

1517
01:35:14,175 --> 01:35:18,210
Well, I hope at least
they're flying you
first class.

1518
01:35:18,212 --> 01:35:21,747
Geri doesn't
like me that much.
But she does like me now,

1519
01:35:21,749 --> 01:35:23,716
so while I have this juice,

1520
01:35:23,718 --> 01:35:25,918
I've got to leverage it
into something better.

1521
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:27,386
Yes!

1522
01:35:27,388 --> 01:35:28,487
Yes, wait, Iraq.

1523
01:35:28,489 --> 01:35:29,555
I'll come with you.

1524
01:35:29,557 --> 01:35:32,958
No, actually, Pakistan.
That's where
the real shooting shit is.

1525
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:33,892
It's like
the wild west out there.

1526
01:35:33,894 --> 01:35:37,763
Actually, I told geri
that I want New York or D.C.

1527
01:35:42,902 --> 01:35:44,436
No, I did.

1528
01:35:44,871 --> 01:35:46,739
No, really, where are you going?

1529
01:35:46,741 --> 01:35:48,607
New York or D.C.

1530
01:35:50,477 --> 01:35:51,810
Why?

1531
01:35:52,879 --> 01:35:55,180
You can still come with me.

1532
01:36:00,854 --> 01:36:03,088
Because I think
there's plenty of good work

1533
01:36:03,090 --> 01:36:04,456
to be done in the real world,

1534
01:36:04,458 --> 01:36:06,391
and the kabubble
is well-established.

1535
01:36:06,393 --> 01:36:09,061
Is this about me going
to badakhshan without you?

1536
01:36:09,063 --> 01:36:11,830
'Cause you would have done
exactly the same thing.

1537
01:36:11,832 --> 01:36:14,933
And, hey, what, i forgive you!

1538
01:36:17,203 --> 01:36:18,637
This is not about you.

1539
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:21,473
It's not about badakhshan,
or Glasgow,

1540
01:36:21,475 --> 01:36:24,109
or the cottage
with the chickens.

1541
01:36:24,811 --> 01:36:26,378
What chickens?

1542
01:36:32,619 --> 01:36:35,287
It's okay.
I know you're not gonna come.

1543
01:36:38,591 --> 01:36:41,527
I just have to get out of here
before it's too late.

1544
01:36:42,662 --> 01:36:44,496
What do you mean?

1545
01:36:45,732 --> 01:36:48,767
I started to feel
like this was normal.

1546
01:36:51,271 --> 01:36:53,672
You know it's not, right?

1547
01:37:10,390 --> 01:37:12,658
Come to New York and get it.

1548
01:37:12,959 --> 01:37:16,762
Remember, you're like
a six in Manhattan.

1549
01:37:49,462 --> 01:37:51,363
How's your baby?

1550
01:37:51,831 --> 01:37:53,365
Which one?

1551
01:37:53,499 --> 01:37:55,868
You have two?
Yes.

1552
01:37:57,470 --> 01:37:59,872
Irish twins.

1553
01:38:01,307 --> 01:38:03,542
No, they are very good.

1554
01:38:03,544 --> 01:38:07,079
The younger one, the boy,
he's very strong.

1555
01:38:07,081 --> 01:38:08,347
Mmm.
Mmm.

1556
01:38:08,349 --> 01:38:10,782
I bet the girl is strong, too.

1557
01:38:10,784 --> 01:38:12,484
She's stronger.

1558
01:38:41,581 --> 01:38:43,515
So, um,

1559
01:38:44,217 --> 01:38:47,486
those men in the hospital,
the addicts...

1560
01:38:48,621 --> 01:38:50,856
Any of them ever get better?

1561
01:38:50,858 --> 01:38:53,992
Have a happy ending?

1562
01:39:04,771 --> 01:39:08,607
In my culture, we would hug.

1563
01:40:33,259 --> 01:40:34,526
Hey.

1564
01:40:34,727 --> 01:40:37,629
You know,
I miss it. The Stan.

1565
01:40:37,631 --> 01:40:39,031
Yeah, I miss it, too.

1566
01:40:39,033 --> 01:40:41,767
Actually, I tried to go back

1567
01:40:41,901 --> 01:40:44,002
but even the army
wouldn't take me.

1568
01:40:44,004 --> 01:40:47,839
I mean, the army!
I mean, that's just hurtful.

1569
01:40:50,410 --> 01:40:53,245
Well, I'm very sorry
for what happened to you.

1570
01:40:53,247 --> 01:40:56,748
So if there's anything
that you want to say to me,

1571
01:40:56,750 --> 01:40:58,016
that's why I'm here.

1572
01:40:58,018 --> 01:41:00,218
That's why I came here.

1573
01:41:00,319 --> 01:41:01,653
Ma'am,

1574
01:41:02,388 --> 01:41:06,992
I lost my legs
because of an ied,
not because of you.

1575
01:41:08,261 --> 01:41:10,429
I appreciate that,
but if I hadn't quoted you,

1576
01:41:10,431 --> 01:41:12,998
you wouldn't have
been transferred.

1577
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,300
No, really, you can say
whatever you want to me.

1578
01:41:15,302 --> 01:41:15,901
That's why I'm here.

1579
01:41:15,903 --> 01:41:17,402
Okay, well,
then let's say you're right.

1580
01:41:17,404 --> 01:41:18,937
It's still not
'cause of you, ma'am.

1581
01:41:18,939 --> 01:41:23,175
Some 12-year-old haji
had to plant that bomb.

1582
01:41:23,177 --> 01:41:26,278
And, hell, you know,
if bin laden's parents

1583
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:27,212
hadn't have gotten divorced,

1584
01:41:27,214 --> 01:41:31,249
maybe none of us would've been
in the Stan to begin with.

1585
01:41:32,018 --> 01:41:35,554
And the Taliban, they wouldn't
have even been there for ubl

1586
01:41:35,556 --> 01:41:39,091
if brezhnev hadn't have gone
and fouled up Afghanistan

1587
01:41:39,093 --> 01:41:41,026
in the first place.

1588
01:41:41,260 --> 01:41:45,230
And the British empire. Yeah.

1589
01:41:45,232 --> 01:41:46,364
And Kim Baker.

1590
01:41:46,366 --> 01:41:47,799
Okay, I deserve that.

1591
01:41:47,801 --> 01:41:53,572
Goddamn! Once you got no legs,
everyone takes everything so serious.

1592
01:41:54,108 --> 01:41:58,944
I mean, there's only
so much any of us
have any control of,

1593
01:41:59,278 --> 01:42:00,912
good or bad.

1594
01:42:00,914 --> 01:42:04,816
If you didn't learn
that in Afghanistan, you
were not paying attention.

1595
01:42:04,818 --> 01:42:07,119
So, you're not gonna yell at me?

1596
01:42:07,121 --> 01:42:10,255
I mean, ma'am...

1597
01:42:11,457 --> 01:42:13,792
Kim, you've got to move on.

1598
01:42:14,393 --> 01:42:17,362
You're giving yourself
way too much credit.

1599
01:42:17,597 --> 01:42:20,065
You embrace the suck,

1600
01:42:20,666 --> 01:42:23,235
you move the fuck forward.

1601
01:42:28,508 --> 01:42:31,576
What other fucking
choice do we have?

1602
01:42:34,514 --> 01:42:36,648
Do I hear swearing over there?

1603
01:42:36,650 --> 01:42:39,618
How are you standing there
the one time I curse?

1604
01:42:39,620 --> 01:42:40,318
"One time."
I mean...

1605
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:43,021
It's true. He had a good
long run in the military.

1606
01:42:43,023 --> 01:42:45,157
Don't cover up for him.

1607
01:42:45,159 --> 01:42:46,825
So, Kim, are you
gonna stay for dinner?

1608
01:42:46,827 --> 01:42:48,994
Of course she will.

1609
01:43:09,715 --> 01:43:11,116
Bye!

1610
01:43:11,217 --> 01:43:15,187
Say bye to Kim. Bye, Kim!
Say bye.

1611
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:36,942
Colonel, the Afghan
national army missed

1612
01:43:36,944 --> 01:43:38,109
yet another benchmark
for preparedness.

1613
01:43:38,111 --> 01:43:40,979
How do you think
that will affect
our draw down in the region?

1614
01:43:40,981 --> 01:43:44,316
There needs to be
a revision to the previously
announced draw down

1615
01:43:44,318 --> 01:43:46,384
or our future exit strategy.

1616
01:43:46,386 --> 01:43:47,586
Thank you, colonel Roberts.

1617
01:43:47,588 --> 01:43:48,386
Thank you. My pleasure.

1618
01:43:48,388 --> 01:43:50,755
Coming up,
a look at the war on terror

1619
01:43:50,757 --> 01:43:53,592
that's close to home
for those of us who cover it.

1620
01:43:53,594 --> 01:43:55,627
From London,
I'll be joined
by award-winning

1621
01:43:55,629 --> 01:43:57,862
combat photographer,
iain mackelpie.

1622
01:43:57,864 --> 01:43:59,698
His new book, conflict zone,

1623
01:43:59,700 --> 01:44:01,700
chronicles
a decade spent working

1624
01:44:01,702 --> 01:44:03,969
in the middle east
and Afghanistan.

1625
01:44:03,971 --> 01:44:05,270
That's when we return.

1626
01:44:05,272 --> 01:44:08,673
And we're clear.
Back in 40.

1627
01:44:08,675 --> 01:44:09,140
Hi, iain.

1628
01:44:09,142 --> 01:44:11,376
Hi. Was I supposed
to say something then

1629
01:44:11,378 --> 01:44:12,877
when you introduced me?
Nope.

1630
01:44:12,879 --> 01:44:16,648
Nope. Just sit up, smile.

1631
01:44:17,216 --> 01:44:19,217
I can't smile.
My face feels weird.

1632
01:44:19,219 --> 01:44:21,353
No, you're fine.
You look good.

1633
01:44:21,355 --> 01:44:22,821
Thank you for
coming on the show.

1634
01:44:22,823 --> 01:44:24,122
No, please.
Thanks for having me.

1635
01:44:24,124 --> 01:44:26,758
I got it. Okay, yeah. Got it.

1636
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:28,960
You know, they got me
on this book tour
at the moment.

1637
01:44:28,962 --> 01:44:30,962
I'm gonna be in New York
at the end of the month,

1638
01:44:30,964 --> 01:44:32,931
if you'd fancy a coffee.

1639
01:44:32,933 --> 01:44:37,969
We're back
in five, four, three...
