那是炸彈爆炸的聲音
That was a bomb.

5
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,820
（2006年阿富汗喀布爾）

6
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,710
還不清楚是簡易爆炸裝置 還是特製的汽車炸彈
No word as to whether it was an IED or a specific car bomb.

7
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,950
傷亡人數超過十人

來自ISAF的消息稱 此事也許和ISI有關
Sources within ISAF suggest that ISI may be involved.

9
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,720
這些電話是打不通 還是那混蛋掛了我的電話？
Did these phones just go down or did that fucker hang up on me?

10
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,220
好在X很狡猾 不然我現在就在飛機上了
Good thing that X was bodgy or I'd be flying right now!

11
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,130
我聽不見，親愛的
I can't hear you, honey.

12
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,900
我找艾德·法伯爾
I need to talk to Ed Faber.

13
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,050
那麼是誰在主持？
Well, then who is fronting the show?

14
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,480
我聽不清
I can't hear you!

15
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,110
嘿，那是我的屁股
Hey, that's my ass!

16
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,580
你有媽教嗎？
Do you have a mother?

17
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,380
別用你的屁股碰我的手
Don't put your ass on my hand!

18
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,720
閉嘴，你這死驢臉
Shut up, donkey pussy!

19
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,450
賤貨，公交車
Whore! Dog-washer!

20
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,890
我的老二在你耳朵裏
My cock in your ear!

21
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,220
我的老二在你耳朵裏 我要戳爛你的臭嘴
My cock in your ear! I shit on your lips!

22
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,890
你吃屎去吧
Eat a fart!

23
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,120
喂
Hello!

24

該死...
Fu...

25
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,090
（三年前）

26
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,500
（新聞一部製作人：金姆·貝克）

27
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,480
聽著，伊拉克戰爭正在進行
<i>Listen up. Iraq Two is happening.</i>

28
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:26,450
那裏的關係網已經飽和了 我們所有的人才都去了那裏
The network is stretched thin. All our talent is going there.

29
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,850
我們需要人手填補 阿富汗的空缺，任何人都行
We need people, any people, to fill the void in Afghanistan.

30
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,950
在座的各位都是本公司
And you folks here are all the unmarried,

31
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,000
未婚且沒有孩子的人員
childless personnel in this bureau.

32
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,200
對於那些一直從事幕後工作的人來說
For those of you who are behind the scenes, there are

33
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,430
這是一個走到鏡頭前的機會
opportunities to be on camera.

34
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,500
金姆，你願意一起嗎？
Kim, are you going to be joining in?

35
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,770
一起去還是一起哭？
The travel or the crying?

36
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,200
希望是一起去
Um, hopefully, the travel.

37
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,940
我會考慮的
I'll think about it.

38
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,010
貓鼬行動的成功進行
<i>The success of Operation Mongoose</i>

39
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,780
讓人們忽略了極為重要的一個事實
<i>has overshadowed the real lesson to be learned,</i>

40
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,020
那就是塔利班組織根本未被征服
<i>that the Taliban are far from vanquished.</i>

41
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,180
隨著戰鬥的鼓聲
<i>And as the drums of war</i>

42
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,890
（戰鬥的號角） 在伊拉克愈演愈烈
<i>beat ever louder in Iraq,</i>

43
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,360
北約在阿富汗的任務 變得越來越靠不住
<i>the NATO mission in Afghanistan grows increasingly uncertain.</i>

44
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,300
以上是VBC環球新聞的 譚雅·范德普爾
<i>Tanya Vanderpoel, outside Lashkar Gah, Afghanistan,</i>

45
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,970
從阿富汗拉什卡爾加為您發回的報道
<i>VBC World News.</i>

46
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,000
嘿
Hey.

47
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,380
（愛你，金姆姨媽） 接通了，嘿
I got you! Hey.

48
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,040
你什麼時候從休斯頓回來？
Uh, when do you get back from Houston?

49
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,380
我想是週二，問這個幹嘛？
<i>I think on Tuesday. Why?</i>

50
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:36,550
因為我週二要去阿富汗
Uh, because I'm going to Afghanistan on Tuesday.

51
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,560
你週二要去阿富汗？
<i>You're going to Afghanistan on Tuesday?</i>

52
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:40,920
是的
Yeah.

53
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,890
但你是負責編輯新聞的
<i>But you write news copy.</i>

54
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,400
等等，要去多久？
<i>Wait. For how long?</i>

55
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,370
- 大概三個月 - 什麼？
- Like, three months. <i>- What?</i>

56
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,370
金姆
Kim!

57
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,170
嘿
Hey!

58
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,840
真不敢相信這事成了
I can't believe this worked out!

59
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,510
嘿，你想去衛生間的
Hey, you want to have a quickie

60
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,850
可調桌那兒來一發嗎？
on the changing table in the bathroom?

61
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,880
那個小樹袋熊看著我
Yeah, I don't think I could get it up

62
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,390
我可提不起性趣
with that little koala looking at me.

63
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,610
要開始登記了
Also, they're boarding already.

64
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,280
嘿，別擔心，去吧，去吧
Hey, don't worry. Just go. Go, go, go.

65
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,690
對了，我...我給你配了鑰匙
Oh, shoot, I... I copied a key for you, so...

66
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,920
澆花，信件
Plants, mail.

67
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,790
- 還有什麼需要處理的？ - 我想就那些了
- Anything else I'm forgetting? - I think that's it.

68
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,630
這太瘋狂了
This is crazy.

69
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,530
聽著，我覺得這令人驕傲
Listen, I think it's impressive.

70
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,870
開始新的職業生涯？
Starting a new career?

71
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,300
這會很棒的
It's gonna be great.

72
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,960
聽著，不到三個月
And listen, in three months...

73
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,410
我就回來了
"I'll be back."

74
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,770
不，那太糟了，不
No, that's terrible! No.

75
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,870
別那樣記住我，不
Don't remember me like that. No.

76
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,050
再見，好的，好的
Bye. Okay. Okay.

77
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,890
這不是我的工作，我是個製片人 是安然公司負責新聞的
It's not my job. I'm a producer. General news. Enron.

78
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,450
報道賓夕法尼亞州煤礦工人們的消息
These coalminers in Pennsylvania,

79
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,960
但你也許沒看過
but you probably didn't see that.

80
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,650
因為我們在進行兩場戰爭
'Cause we got two wars going on now,

81
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,160
我知道怎麼設置局域網
so, uh, I know how to set up a BGAN

82
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,930
我死了也沒人會上訴
and no one will sue if I die

83
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,830
所以我兩天前辦了 一張加快簽證
so I got an expedited visa, like, two days ago,

84
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,770
我想現在我是戰地記者
and I guess now I'm a war reporter.

85
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,570
真該死
Shit dick!

86
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,270
螺旋形降落
Corkscrew landing.

87
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,470
以免導彈擊中飛機
In case a missile is fired at the aircraft!

88
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,810
喀布爾國際機場
Kabul International Airport.

89
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,320
簡稱KIA，「在行動中被殺"

車子就在這，我們走吧
The car is over here and we go.

99
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,360
戴上你的頭巾，不要臉的婊子
Cover your head, shameless whore!

100
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,460
她說"歡迎來到阿富汗"
She says, uh... "Welcome to Afghanistan."

101
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,360
好的，我們走
Okay, let's go.

102
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,660
這是你在這裏使用的手機 號碼就在後面
Here is your local mobile. The number is on the back.

103
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,530
是的，我上周要了一些錢 現在還沒到
Yeah, I ordered some money last week. Still in the post.

104
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,300
- 我下周給你答覆 - 好的
- I'll fix you up next week. - Okay.

105
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,200
是的，這裏的空氣得 花點時間才能適應
Yes, the air here takes some getting used to.

106
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,180
有一股排泄物的味道
It's quite polluted with feces.

107
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,410
她來了，你好嗎，金姆？
Ah, here she is! How are you, Kim?

108
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,380
歡迎來到斯坦，我叫尼克
Welcome to the Stan. My name's Nic.

109
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:18,850
我負責你的安全 我來給你拿包
I'll be doing your security. I'll take your bag.

110
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,550
法希姆，警察對我停車在這 唧唧歪歪了
Fahim. The police are giving me shit for parking here.

111
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,890
他們只想要錢
They just want money.

112
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:28,050
等等，不，你需要錢嗎？ 因為他們給我錢了
Wait, oh, no. Um, do you need money? Because the network gave me money.

113
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,250
- 不，你留著 - 不不不，金姆，拜託
- No, keep that on you! - No, no, no! Kim, please!

114
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,600
滾開，好了，好了，嘿，嘿
Piss off, that's it! That's it! Hey! Hey!

115
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,700
- 很抱歉，抱歉 - 滾開
- I'm sorry. Sorry. - Piss off!

116
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,780
要記住我們在高海拔地區
Remember that we are at altitude here,

117
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,190
所以要記得喝夠飲水
so drink plenty of water while you acclimatize.

118
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,950
你在哪學的英語？
Where did you learn English?

119
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,390
在醫學院，我以前是醫生
At medical school. I was a doctor.

120
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,700
聽著，今晚好好休息
Listen, rest up tonight.

121
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,230
明天，我送你去你入駐的基地
Tomorrow, I'll drive you to the base for your embed.

122
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,260
只能帶一個袋子
And just one bag,

123
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,400
要多帶襪子和短褲
but make sure you pack extra socks and knickers.

124
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,540
我指的是"短內褲"，懂嗎？
That's like, um, it's like "panties," yeah?

125
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,180
Mmm-hmm.

126
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,870
那麼，你之前去部隊體驗過生活嗎？
So, you've been embedded before, then?

127
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,280
也不是，我們在2001年 接受過在敵方地區生存的訓練
Not really. We all did hostile-zone training in 2001.

128
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:27,440
他們教我們在被人 抓住時要記得配合
They taught us to open our mouths if we get mortared...

129
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,480
諸如此類的東西
That kind of stuff.

130
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,480
好的
Okay.

131
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,460
日安，卡達爾
G'day, Qadar.

132
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,300
（達裏語）

133
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,610
一路上都是排泄物的氣味
The feces smell all the way to here.

134
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,350
金姆，你的房間在樓上
Your room, Kim, is upstairs.

135
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,470
是的，他們很喜歡這個
Yeah, they're bloody addicted.

136
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,690
那個傢伙就曾因為下毛片 把電腦活活下爆炸了
That one melted a laptop downloading porno.

137
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,530
我是賈維德

138
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,830
他喜歡看人獸片

139
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,460
- 嗨 - 嗨
- Hi. - Hi.

140
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,370
太不幸了
It's unfortunate.

141
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,640
金姆，這位是高布萊恩
Kim, this is Tall Brian.

142
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,870
我是布萊恩·霍珀，高布萊恩

143
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,000
- 嗨 - 我是你的攝影師
- Hi. - I'm your shooter.

144
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,980
那麼，這附近還有一個比你矮的 名叫布萊恩的人？
So, is there another Brian around here somewhere that you're taller than?

145
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,620
矮布萊恩，路透社的人
Short Brian. Works for Reuters.

146
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,150
你們中不能有一個就叫"布萊恩"嗎？
Couldn't one of you just be "Brian"?

147
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,290
說的對，我沒想過
Fair enough. Didn't think of that.

148
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,950
對了，矮布萊恩死了
Also Short Brian's dead.

149
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,830
- 該死，真的嗎？ - 是的
- Oh, fuck. Really? - Yes.

150
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,560
總之，歡迎來到遊樂園
Anyway, welcome to the Fun House.

151
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,530
甜蜜之家
Home sweet home.

152
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,200
這是你的房間
This is your room.

153
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,140
有洗澡的地方嗎？
Is there a shower?

154
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,100
一個習慣於戰爭的民族
<i>A nation accustomed to war</i>

155
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,080
再次迫切需要回歸正軌
<i>once again seeks a return to normality.</i>

156
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,420
沒有哪個地方比這裏 更具有象徵意義
<i>And nothing symbolizes that effort more than this place,</i>

157
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,780
喀布爾動物園
<i>the Kabul Zoo.</i>

158
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,690
不，不是吧，動物園？
No, he didn't. The zoo?

159
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,090
回去睡吧
Go back to Wapping.

160
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,460
你這該死的遊客
You fucking tourist!

161
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,530
該死，抱歉，我想找洗澡的地兒
Uh, shit. Sorry. I'm trying to find the shower?

162
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,930
你是那新來的姑娘
You're the new girl.

163
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,200
我的天，我是金姆·貝克
Oh, my God. Uh... Kim Baker.

164
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,070
我剛從紐約到這裏
Just got here from New York.

165
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,800
我是譚雅，我的天
I'm Tanya. Oh, my God,

166
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,240
這裏多一個女人真是太好了
it's so nice to have another woman in the house!

167
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,610
我喜歡你的唇彩，是什麼牌子的？
I love that lippy color. What is that?

168
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,940
不，那些是真正的裂痕
No, they're just really chapped.

169
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,110
可憐的傢伙，我能幫你什麼？
Oh, you poor thing. Can I get you anything?

170
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:15,210
抱歉，我嚇壞了 因為我看過
I'm sorry, I'm freaking out because I saw your

171
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,620
你在克倫加爾插隊的 特別報道，那太棒了
special about your embed in Korengal, and it was amazing.

172
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,950
謝謝你，說的真好
Thank you. That's so sweet.

173
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,460
- 在哪能洗澡？ - 好的，走這邊
- Where's the shower? - Yes. This way.

174
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,090
我能請你幫個忙嗎，金姆？
Can I ask a favor, Kim?

175
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,460
- 你不用勉強答應 - 好的，問吧
- And absolutely feel free to say no. - Yeah, sure.

176
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,760
我也不想提及
I hate to even bring it up.

177
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,240
- 我感覺這樣很魯莽 - 不，沒事的
- I feel so rude even asking this. - No, it's fine.

178
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,830
我能上你的安保人員嗎？
Can I fuck your security guys?

179
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,970
什麼？
What? Oh.

180
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,570
請你自便
By all means, yeah.

181
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,670
是嗎？我是說，我也不想這樣
Yeah? I mean, I wouldn't ask,

182
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,650
但是因為一些原因
it's just that for some reason,

183
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,910
VBC採用了美國的承包商
the VBC use an American contractor

184
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,950
我無意冒犯，但是他們都
and, I mean, no offense, but they're all, like,

185
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,850
留著山羊鬍，又胖又壯實
goatees and "fat-strong."

186
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,290
你懂嗎？但是澳洲人 和新西蘭人很火辣
You know? But the Aussies and Kiwis are so hot.

187
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,330
好的，我懂了，別客氣
Right. I get it. Be my guest.

188
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,090
你確定？別因為講禮貌才那麼說
You sure? Don't just say that to be polite.

189
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,430
不，是真的，是真的
No, I wouldn't. I'm not.

190
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,690
包括尼克？你不把尼克 留給自己用嗎？
Even Nic? You don't want Nic for yourself?

191
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,320
尼克？
Nic?

192
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,960
不，我不想，不
No. I don't. No.

193
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,330
那是不可能發生的 所以你不用客氣
That's... No, that would never happen. So you're good.

194
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:10,170
嘿，不，金姆，別那樣說 你可以上了尼克
Hey! No, Kim, don't say that. You could have Nic.

195
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,340
在阿富汗，你可是個大美人
In Afghanistan, you're a serious piece of ass.

196
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,000
謝謝，真會說話
Thank you. That's nice.

197
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,610
因為你是，我是說
Because you're what, I mean, you're like,

198
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,620
你在紐約大概能打六七分？
a seven, a six or seven in New York?

199
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,350
在這裏，你能打九分
Here, you're a nine.

200
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,480
甚至是十分
Borderline ten.

201
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,150
這叫做"喀布爾的美"
It's called "Kabul Cute."

202
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,860
你在這裏是不是15分？
What are you here, like a 15?

203
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,650
是的
Yeah.

204
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,640
Huh.

205
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,970
關鍵是，我在家有男友
The thing is, I have a very serious boyfriend at home,

206
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,630
所以，你不用客氣
so, you're good.

207
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,000
好的，那就過兩個月再來找我
All right, well, come talk to me in two months

208
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,740
到時候你就知道什麼叫慾求不滿了 洗澡去那邊
when your pussy's eating your leg. Shower's that way.

209
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,980
你好嗎？
How you doing?

210
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,550
這裏太蕭條了
It's bananas here. It's, um...

211
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,350
空氣中一直充斥著一股屎尿味
My nose is running. There's shit in the air,

212
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,830
是真的
literally.

213
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,060
還有
And.

214
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,700
我想我做不到
I don't think I can do this.

215
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,230
做什麼？
<i>Do what?</i>

216
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,720
金姆？
<i>Kim?</i>

217
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,560
我認為我做不到
I don't think I can do this.

218
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,660
你能看到...我不，喂
<i>Can you see... I don't... Hello?</i>

219
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:16,830
見鬼
Shit.

220
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:30,910
（帕爾旺省巴格拉姆空軍基地）

221
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:35,920
抱歉，上校，作為一名記者 我是不能接受禮物的
I'm sorry, Colonel, I can't accept gifts as a journalist.

222
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,220
好的
Okay.

223
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,920
那麼寄宿，交通運輸
So lodging, transport,

224
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,520
食物和保護 就是你所能接受的東西？
chow and protection, that's all you can accept?

225
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,260
我將盡力保持客觀
I'll do my best to stay objective.

226
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,400
我不在乎你是否能完成任務 我在乎的是我的手下能否完成
I don't care if you can do your job. I care if my men can.

227
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,730
貝克小姐，你熟悉"四十四」理論嗎？
Are you familiar with the term "four-ten-four", Miss Baker?

228
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,210
沒聽說過，上校
I am not, Colonel.

229
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,110
指的是在祖國能打四分的女人
It refers to women who are fours back home

230
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,080
到了國外就能得十分
become tens when they ship out

231
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,050
當他們回到美國本土 就又只能打四分了
and when they're back stateside, they become fours again.

232
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,610
你的意思是我能打四分？
Are you saying I'm a four?

233
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:04,450
我說的是你背著 一個該死的橙色背包
I'm saying you carry an orange fucking backpack.

234
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:09,390
我看過不少人在這個 地方做了錯誤的決定
I've seen people with actual experience make bad decisions here.

235
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:12,090
所以當你和我的人在 外面執行任務時
So while you're outside the wire with my men,

236
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,500
就千萬不要讓他們分心，明白嗎？
you will in no way distract them, understood?

237
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,960
你是在讓我別和你的士兵們上床嗎？
Are you asking me not to sleep with your soldiers?

238
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,270
不，不是士兵們，是海軍陸戰隊員
No, not "soldiers." Marines.

239
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,500
你來這裏不是為了睡遍
You're not here to sleep with

240
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,810
或者勾引遍我的陸戰隊員
or perform jobs of any type on my Marines.

241
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,310
明白了嗎，貝克小姐？
Clear copy, Miss Baker?

242
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,910
- 懂了 - 很好
- Copy that. - Good.

243
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:32,010
只要我們找到合適的時機 就會把你送走的
We'll get you out to a FOB as soon as we find a ride for you.

244
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,640
在此期間，斯特恩上尉
In the meantime, Captain Stern here

245
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,240
將會盡量為你安排"一瓶濕的烈酒"
will see to it that you get a wet hootch.

246
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,250
什麼？
A what?

247
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,250
是指能洗澡的帳篷
It's a tent with a shower.

248
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,650
除非你更願意做不帶 沐浴設施的帳篷
Unless you'd prefer a dry hootch.

249
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,200
我不願意，長官
I would not, sir.

250
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,580
抱歉
Sorry.

251
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,990
你能說出你的名字和軍銜嗎？
Could you just... State your name and rank?

252
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,350
三級軍士長克林頓·J·赫德
Gunnery Sergeant Clinton J. Hurd.

253
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,020
好的，該死的
All right. Uh... Dang it!

254
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:57,430
那麼，你認為阿富汗尼人 喜歡我們在這嗎？
So, do you believe the Afghani people are happy about our presence here?

255
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,430
不，阿富汗人才是指人
No, Afghans are the people.

256
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:02,770
阿富汗尼是貨幣名稱
Afghanis is the currency.

257
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,670
沒錯，我知道，謝謝你
That's right. I knew that. Thank you.

258
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,770
你在這裏是為了執行什麼任務？
What do you believe your mission to be here?

259
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,210
女士，你的褲子上有張貼紙
Ma'am, you got a sticker on your pants.

260
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,370
這讓我犯強迫癥了，女士
It's bugging the shit out of me. Ma'am...

261
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,450
法希姆
Fahim.

262
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,380
你是因為什麼入伍的？
What inspired you to enlist originally?

263
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:19,220
我是阿諾·施瓦辛格的影片 《鐵血戰士》的忠實粉絲
I'm a big fan of the movie <i>Predator</i> with Arnold Schwarzenegger.

264
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,690
我們一樣高
We're the same height.

265
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,800
你認為伊拉克的戰爭 影響到了你們這裏的環境嗎？
Do you think the war in Iraq has affected your resources here?

266
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,630
抱歉，女士，我無權回答那個問題
I'm sorry, ma'am, I'm not authorized to answer that question.

267
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,530
我得說我們都想錯了波斯
I'd say we're both on the wrong side of Persia, ma'am.

268
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,970
伊拉克還算是好的
Iraq is where you get some right now.

269
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,230
這裏簡直不能忍
Here just has shit all.

270
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,940
你們經常出去巡邏嗎？
Are you guys getting outside the wire much?

271
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,070
是的，女士，大部分時候...
Yes, ma'am. Most days. Uh...

272
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,770
我們會出去幫助 社區工程的建設之類的
You know, we help out with community projects and all.

273
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,040
還有挖井...
And wells. Uh...

274
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,550
有時候晚上我們會 和武裝勢力發生衝突
And sometimes at night we shoot the big gun,

275
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,650
- 但是，這裏很和平 - 天啊
- but, you know, it's quiet here. - Jesus!

276
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,160
我們甚至不穿防彈衣
We don't wear IBAs on the FOB.

277
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,160
我甚至不給武器裝彈藥，因為
I don't even chamber a round in my weapon anymore, because,

278
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,930
你懂得，我覺得走火 比塔利班還可怕
you know, I figure accidental discharge is scarier than the Taliban.

279
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,490
因為伊拉克的戰爭 你覺得人們忘了阿富汗的事了嗎？
With Iraq, do you feel like people have forgotten about Afghanistan?

280
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,260
這個嘛...
Oh, well...

281
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:08,170
是的，夫人，我覺得這是 十分貼切的描述
Yes, ma'am. I'd say that surely is the word for it.

282
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,840
這裏進行的是一場被遺忘的戰爭
This here's a forgotten war.

283
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,500
並不是頭等重要的
It's capital F, capital W.

284
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,340
你的名字和軍銜？
What's your, uh... Your name and rank?

285
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,850
我是印第安3-5連隊的 一等兵考夫林
I'm Lance Corporal Coughlin, India Company 3-5.

286
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,510
謝謝你
Thank you.

287
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,350
金姆，你的頭髮
Kim. Your hair.

288
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,330
謝謝，法希姆
- Thanks, Fahim. - Mmm-hmm.

289
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,470
你真可靠
You really are a fixer.

290
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,710
月亮出來了
Moon's out.

291
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,240
Hmm.

292
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,040
很美
It's beautiful.

293
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,390
舔我的蛋吧
Suck my dick!

294
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,890
那是什麼意思？
What does that mean?

295
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,330
意思是"真可怕"
- It means, "Oh, what a terrible event!" - Uh-huh.

296
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,490
貝克小姐
Miss Baker.

297
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,400
霍蘭尼克上校明天要去諾頓
Colonel Hollanek is coming to Norton tomorrow

298
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,990
檢查一下我們的任務進展情況
to check on some of our PRT work.

299
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,130
你和你的組員們可以跟隨前往
And you and your crew are clear to tag along.

300
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,900
- 很好，謝謝 - 零六出發
- Great, thanks. - Rolls out at zero-six.

301
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,970
- 就是早上六點 - 我知道，是的
- That's 6:00 a.m. - I know that, yeah.

302
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,810
開火
Fire!

303
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,380
快點，我們走 整理好東西，我們得走了
Come on, let's go! Get this shit together! We gotta move!

304
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,210
交出你的背包
Fucking hands out of your pockets!

305
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,810
你覺得你這是在陸軍部隊嗎？
You think you're in the fucking Army?

306
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,710
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

307
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,250
這是什麼？
What is this?

308
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,880
是我的物資和攝像器材
Uh, that's my supplies. Camera stuff.

309
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,760
你在逗我嗎？
You fucking kidding me?

310
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:40,820
這是個橙色的袋子 不，夫人，不準帶上我的車
This is an orange ruck. No, ma'am. Not on my vehicle.

311
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:44,340
樂斯菲斯店的售貨員 說過這是軍方級別的東西
The girl at the North Face store said it was, like, military grade.

312
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,000
那你要把它藏在哪？ 藏在日落的餘暉里嗎？
Well, where are you gonna hide it? Inside a fucking sunset?

313
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,410
連荷蘭的軍隊都 不帶橙色的裝備
I mean, even the Dutch Army don't wear orange.

314
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,840
處理好
Fix it.

315
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,680
我要怎麼處理？
How do I fix it?

316
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,910
拉波諾
Rapono!

317
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:14,420
得保持水分，女士
Got to stay hydrated, ma'am.

318
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,760
考夫林，我都沒認出你來
Coughlin. I didn't recognize you.

319
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,400
那是因為我現在是勇者模式
That's 'cause I'm in warrior mode.

320
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,200
讓我顯得更高大
It makes me taller.

321
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,900
好好享受吧，女士
Enjoy the ride, ma'am.

322
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,800
我很想知道誰炸了我的水井
I'm dying to know who blew up my well.

323
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,240
正在調查，上校
Working on it, Colonel.

324
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,310
那可是很幸運的水井，下士
That was a nice fucking well, Corporal.

325
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,670
（達裏語）

326
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,140
他說什麼？
What'd he say?

327
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,150
那是什麼意思？
What's that mean?

328
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,120
他想知道你是不是俄羅斯人
He wants to know if you are the Russians.

329
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,160
俄羅斯人？
- The Russians? - Mmm.

330
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,820
不
No!

331
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,360
不，先生，那是20年前的事了
No, sir. That was 20 years ago.

332
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,800
我們是來幫忙的
And we're here to help.

333
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,830
我是黑人
And I'm black.

334
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,760
現在俄羅斯人都變黑了
The Russians are blacks now.

335
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,670
如果我們把水井修好 你們就不能炸毀它
If we fix the well, you can't blow it up.

336
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,040
金姆，我剛才和一些年輕人談過
Kim, I was talking to some of the younger men.

337
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,380
他們說塔利班晚上來過
They say the Taliban came at night.

338
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,820
我不在乎，我喝太多水了 我得撒尿
I don't care. No. I drank too much water and I have to pee.

339
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,790
別說了，別說了，我就要結婚了
Stop. Stop. I am engaged to be married.

340
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,020
好的，法希姆，我知道你理想中的女人
Okay, Fahim, I know you like your women to be, like,

341
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,460
是美麗而神秘的存在，好嗎？
beautiful, mysterious IKEA bags, okay?

342
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,630
但我們確實要從陰道撒尿
But we urinate, Doctor. Out of our vaginas.

343
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,630
你認為你的尿液是從...
You think you urinate out the...

344
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,070
不，我知道這是不一樣的
No. I know it's a separate thing!

345
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,370
天啊，幫幫我
God! Just please help me.

346
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,340
這裏沒有上廁所的地兒
There is nowhere for you to go.

347
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,140
我不能去問那些男人
I cannot ask these men about this.

348
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,740
而我也不能和那些女人搭話
And I'm not allowed to talk to the women.

349
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,010
好的，算了吧，我忍著 女人是很堅強的，對吧？
Fine. Forget it. I'll hold it. Women are tough, right?

350
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,390
你沒事吧，女士？
Are you okay, ma'am?

351
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,890
天啊，該死的，夥計，這是新的
Gosh, damn it, man. This is a new one.

352
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:27,760
我本來很不爽你的都來 但今天我很樂意出來
I was cursing your name at 0-stupid-30, but I'm glad I came out today.

353
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,830
如果不是我 你今天就不用巡邏嗎？
Would you not have gone on patrol today if I weren't here?

354
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,890
是的，我要回諾頓挖戰壕
No, I'd be back in Norton filling HESCOs.

355
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,200
收到
Copy that.

356
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:38,330
還早著呢，這次肯定是大生意
We're still 5 mikes. It must be one hairy dump.

357
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,710
不，我才剛穿上衣服 該死的，赫德軍士
No, I'm just getting my pants on. Damn it, Sergeant Hurd.

358
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,040
隨便
Whatever.

359
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,210
抱歉，抱歉，抱歉
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

360
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,340
出發
Marine!

361
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,110
讓個洞出來，貝克
Make a hole, Baker.

362
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,620
出發
Move out!

363
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,720
為什麼停下了？
Why are we stopping?

364
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,450
領頭的車子爆胎了
The lead vehicle bottomed out.

365
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:30,500
好的，注意警戒
Okay! Heads on a swivel!

366
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,060
這條路不是走過嗎？
Didn't we come this way?

367
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,460
應該是的
We most surely did.

368
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,570
- 有人襲擊 - 呆在車裏
- Contact left! - Stay in the vehicle!

369
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,400
該死，熱，熱彈殼
Shit! Hot! Hot bullet things!

370
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:55,650
金姆，別下車，金姆
Kim, don't get out of the car! Kim!

371
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,990
Whoa!

372
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,530
給我趴到發動機後面去
Get down behind the engine block!

373
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,430
呆在那，呆在那
Stay there! Stay there!

374
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,170
金姆
Kim.

375
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,600
回到車上去
Get back in the car!

376
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,310
不，拜託，金姆
No, please, Kim!

377
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,500
女士，我讓你呆著別動
Ma'am, I asked you to stay put!

378
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,030
那些混蛋想打死我們
Those assholes tried to shoot us!

379
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:44,800
老天爺
Jesus!

380
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,900
你肯定是在逗我
You have got to be shitting me!

381
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,200
你用一發導彈就為了炸一輛車
You just shot a Javelin at a fucking car!

382
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,680
那可是價值八萬美金的東西
That's an $80,000 piece of ordnance!

383
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,840
你們中哪個天才能告訴我
Can any of you geniuses tell me the Kelley Blue Book value

384
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,750
一輛89年的豐田皮卡多少錢？
of a 1989 Toyota pickup?

385
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,190
貝克，不錯
Oorah, Baker. Get some.

386
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,730
希望你都拍下來了，女士
I hope you got all that on film, ma'am.

387
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,900
因為那可是我們最強力的火力
'Cause that right there, that's what we do best.

388
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,440
心和理智
Hearts and minds.

389
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:27,340
是兩個最適合打擊的地方
That's the two best places to shoot somebody.

390
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,540
什麼？
What?

391
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,280
我說過讓你呆在車裏
I told you to stay in the car.

392
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,360
好的，我回車上去
Okay, I'll get back in the car.

393
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,680
陸戰隊員們對於 伊拉克沒什麼好說的
<i>The Marines don't have much to say about Iraq.</i>

394
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,530
他們的理由是他們把 注意力都放在這裏的工作上
<i>Their mantra is that they are focused on doing the job here.</i>

395
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,590
雖然如此，如我們所見的
<i>And even though, as we saw firsthand,</i>

396
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,930
針對聯合軍隊的襲擊結束了
<i>attacks against coalition forces are up,</i>

397
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:52,200
考夫林下士之前就告訴我 他依然不準備
<i>Corporal Coughlin told me earlier that he is still not planning</i>

398
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,600
在巡邏土中為武器裝彈
<i>to lock and load his weapon when he is out on patrol.</i>

399
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,110
以上是本臺記者金姆·貝克 從現場發回的報道
<i>Our own Kim Baker reporting for us live.</i>

400
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,240
歡迎
Welcome!

401
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,380
做的好，金姆，太殘忍了
Wow, good job, Kim! Ruthless!

402
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,950
賤貨，我們今晚要出去玩
Bitch, we are going out tonight! Whoo!

403
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:43,250
沒事的，沒事的，給你
It's okay. It's okay. Here.

404
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:49,160
沒事的，會好的
It's okay. It's all right.

405
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,270
為什麼我不知道你是誰
Why don't I know who you are?

406
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,830
你現在42歲了？
You're what, like, 42?

407
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:05,930
差不多
Sold.

408
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,340
為什麼我從未聽說過你？
Why have I never heard of you?

409
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:10,810
是的，我沒做過多少 海外的報道
Yeah, I haven't done a lot of overseas reporting.

410
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:14,110
大部分做的是國內的報告文學
I've done mostly domestic <i>reportage.</i>

411
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,480
報告文學？
<i>"Reportage"?</i>

412
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:19,390
國內報告文學
Domestic <i>reportage.</i>

413
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,820
聽著，這裏的人都這樣，沒事的
Look, everyone in the Kabubble is full of shit. It's okay.

414
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,060
有一半人的口音是假裝的
Half the accents are fake.

415
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:28,160
所謂的"特種部隊的經歷"都是假的
The whole "I'm ex-Special Forces" wankers are flat out lying.

416
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,130
報告文學
<i>"Reportage"?</i>

417
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,030
天啊，這是怎麼回事？
Oh, Christ, what is this?

418
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,840
我不該偷聽你們的談話
I really shouldn't have my back to the door.

419
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,380
那是很糟糕的技術
It's bad tradecraft,

420
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,140
但是很值得和你們兩位談談
but it's worth it to talk to you two ladies.

421
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,150
滾開
- Fuck off. - Ugh.

422
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,810
明白了
You got it.

423
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,340
香檳？
Champagne?

424
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:50,820
謝謝你
Thank you.

425
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,180
把這喝完
Finish this,

426
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,520
然後我們去阿克巴漢區見幾個朋友
and then we'll go meet some friends in Wazir Akbar Khan.

427
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:57,320
現在我先警告你 不要和伊安上床
And I am warning you now, do not sleep with lain.

428
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,360
- 伊安是誰？ - 他是個大混蛋
- Who is lain? - He's a proper asshole.

429
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,430
- 可以走了嗎？ - 是的
- Shall we? - Yeah.

430
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,090
那是出租車嗎？
Is that a cab?

431
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,600
你的全名就是夏奇拉？
Is your full name Shakira?

432
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,070
我還因為那是哥倫比亞的綽號呢
'Cause I thought it was a Colombian nickname.

433
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,270
你為何那麼想？
Why would you think that?

434
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:14,440
因為那個歌手
Because of the singer.

435
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:19,040
不，我知道，我開玩笑的 不，那是"感恩"的阿拉伯語
No, I know. I'm kidding. No, it's Arabic for "thankful."

436
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,740
金姆在美國是"冰美人"的意思
Kim is American for "white lady."

437
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:24,360
事實上，金姆在土耳其語裏 是誰的意思
Actually, "Kim" means "who" in Turkish.

438
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,250
"那個冰美人是誰？"
"Who's that white lady?"

439
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,760
是金姆
It's Kim.

440
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:30,350
你就那樣記住我的名字
That's so you can remember my name.

441
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,120
這位是伊安，伊安，這位是金姆
So... This is Iain. Iain, Kim.

442
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:38,040
金姆，金姆，金姆，做得好
Kim. Kim. Kim. Kim, nice work.

443
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,200
坐在和德克薩斯一般大的 國家唯一的兩個女性身邊
You sit next to the only two women in a country the size of Texas

444
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,470
真的能證明一個男人的帥氣
that remind a man that you're really only okay looking.

445
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,280
她說你是個混蛋
Well, she said you were an asshole,

446
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,640
但那真的有點過了
but that's really above and beyond.

447
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,770
- 誰說的？ - 譚雅
- Who said that? - Tanya.

448
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:51,280
不不，我可不這麼想
No. No. No. I don't think so.

449
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:53,110
很多女人都覺得我很有魅力
A lot of women find me very charming, Kim.

450
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:55,880
- 不，那不是生物學上的女人 - 是嗎？
- No, not biological women. - Oh, really?

451
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,290
而是那種認為口音
Women who think that an accent

452
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,410
和人性是
is the same thing

453
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,960
一碼事的女人
- as a personality, maybe. - Oh!

454
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:01,460
你真是能說
<i>Nae, haud yer wheesht.</i>

455
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,590
真是讓人惱怒啊
<i>Go bile yer heid, ya wee bampot.</i>

456
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:07,990
我打賭你的下面 現在濕的不成樣子了
I bet you're wetter than a submarine with screen doors now.

457
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,080
Oh!

458
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,130
我是從書上學的
I got that from a pickup book.

459
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,640
- 天啊 - 是的
- Jesus. - Oh, yeah.

460
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,720
Mmm.

461
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,460
你是怎麼想的？
So what's your deal?

462
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,100
你被一些人愛撫著
You got chucked over by some guy

463
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,800
所以你想著"忘了他
so you think, "Forget him."

464
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,900
我要發現東方的美好
"I'm gonna go discover the wonders of the East,"

465
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:23,280
我要上一個蘇格蘭男人 然後寫本書"
"and I'm gonna fuck a Scottish guy and write a book."

466
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,980
我就是蘇格蘭人
I'm Scottish, by the way.

467
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,410
乾杯
Cheers.

468
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,920
乾杯
Cheers.

469
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,920
- 乾杯 - 乾杯
- Cheers. <i>- Salud.</i>

470
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,860
- 乾杯 - 敬金姆
- Cheers. - To Kim!

471
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,760
這是你第一晚出來嗎？
Is this your first night out?

472
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,360
是的
Yes.

473
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,160
是真的
It is, actually.

474
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,500
那個小混蛋
That little bastard!

475
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,600
不，金姆
Oh, no, Kim.

476
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,270
你該不會給他錢了吧？
You didn't give Egg Boy money, did you?

477
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,340
嘿，混蛋，嘿 你真是個小混蛋
Hey! Egg Boy! Hey! You're a little shitbird!

478
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,510
去死吧

479
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:02,280
祝你消化不良
I hope you get salmonella!

480
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,110
天啊
Oh!

481
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:06,180
我給了他一百塊
I gave him, like, $100!

482
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,730
- 一百塊？ - 什麼？
- $100? - What?

483
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,720
一百塊我也干
I'd give you my eggs for $100.

484
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,060
我們去哪？
Where are we going?

485
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,630
妓院，你會喜歡的
A whorehouse. You're going to love it.

486
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,300
看到了嗎？
You see that?

487
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,300
這裏是妓院，也是中餐館
It's a brothel and a Chinese restaurant.

488
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:37,750
你記得那視頻嗎？
Do you remember this video?

489
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:41,320
大家都喜歡
Everybody was drawings.

490
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,830
我？不，謝謝
Me? Oh, no, thank you.

491
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:50,870
聽著，一個月前 我在寫關於玉米糖漿的故事
Look, a month ago, I was writing a story about corn syrup.

492
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,730
好嗎？我不開心
Okay? I was not happy.

493
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:55,200
我認為我這輩子就那樣了
I didn't think there was anything else out there for me.

494
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,570
只能等死
Just death.

495
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,840
然後這件事發生了...
Then this came along and...

496
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,610
我不在乎
I don't care.

497
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,380
你們會定期去檢查身體嗎？
Wenge, do you guys have regular access to healthcare?

498
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:15,420
他叫我混蛋
He called me a Fenian bastard.

499
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,860
為此我把他的牙打沒了
I fuckin' showed him what for, kicked his teeth in, the cunt.

500
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,200
譚雅？她有什麼故事？
Oi, Tanya? What's her story?

501
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:26,600
她有男友，她現在神志不清，好嗎？
She has a boyfriend. And she's unconscious, okay?

502
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:29,140
這兩個條件以前可阻止不了你
Not that either of those things have ever stopped you before.

503
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:31,110
不是的，不是的
That's not true. That's not true.

504
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,240
首先，我害怕男友們
- Firstly, I'm afraid of boyfriends. - Mmm-hmm.

505
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,370
其次，我是個紳士
Secondly, I'm a gentleman.

506
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:40,610
什麼？根據某些人的記錄
What? According to no less an authority than Grace Mugabe.

507
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,210
我是幫女士開過門的
I held a door open for her once.

508
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,480
讓我玩玩躲貓貓
Let me just have a little peekaboo.

509
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,890
走開
Get out!

510
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,760
這樣不壞
Actually, not bad.

511
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,950
- 我想我錯過了 - 住手
- I think I missed one. - Stop!

512
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,300
這樣挺好的，來吧
<i>Il y a du monde au balcon. Pas mal.</i>

513
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,560
金姆？
Kim?

514
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,070
你沒事吧，夥計？
You all right there, mate?

515
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,630
你為什麼要知道？
Oh, wouldn't you like to know?

516
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,400
嘿，我只是關心她的安危
Hey. I'm just talking about her safety.

517
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:04,070
尼克是金姆的保鏢
Nic here does security for Kim, Iain.

518
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,080
好的，好吧
Right, well!

519
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,280
我走了，失陪
I'm off. Excuse me.

520
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,640
- 失陪 - 晚安
- Excused. - Good night.

521
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,750
- 再見，親愛的 - 再見
- Bye, darling! - Good night.

522
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:24,490
最好的尼克
The best, Nic!

523
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
那是歐普拉
Oh, that's Oprah.

524
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,280
喂
Hello.

525
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,850
是我，法希姆，你準備好出發了嗎？
It's Fahim. Are you ready to go?

526
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,860
去哪，夥計，今天週六
Go where, dude? It's Saturday.

527
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,300
週五是穆斯林人唯一的休息日
Friday is the only day off in the Islamic week.

528
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,800
我沒得去採訪
We have interviews.

529
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,700
不，那可說不通，那...不
No! That was not made clear. That's... No.

530
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,790
那是廢話，不行
That's bullshit, Fahim. No.

531
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,640
金姆，今天我們要去見 阿里·馬蘇德·薩迪克
Kim, today we are meeting Ali Massoud Sadiq.

532
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,470
我做了研究，他就要成為司法部長了
<i>I sent research. He's likely to be Attorney General.</i>

533
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:19,880
- 請等等 - 請你出來
- Please hold. - Please come outside.

534
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:23,180
這和我們美國人的做法不同
This is against what I believe as an American.

535
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,250
抱歉，但我們必須得去
I am sorry, but we have to go.

536
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,150
我的鞋子，該死
<i>Oh, my shoes. Shit.</i>

537
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:29,720
你想採訪我，阿赫邁德賽先生？
You wish to interview me, Mr. Ahmadzai?

538
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:33,160
是的，薩迪克先生 還得拍攝下來
I do, Mr. Sadiq. Yes, on camera.

539
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,330
阿赫邁德賽先生
Mr. Ahmadzai,

540
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:37,390
我只是一個
I am a person of,

541
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:39,730
一個小人物而已
of no consequence.

542
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,070
你很快也許就能成為
Well, you soon might be

543
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,610
阿富汗第二權利的人
the second most powerful person in Afghanistan.

544
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,870
阿赫邁德賽先生
Mr. Ahmadzai,

545
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:48,240
我負責了內政部的一個小部門
I run a small department inside the Interior Ministry.

546
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:51,440
美國人為何對我感興趣？
What possible interest could I be to the Americans?

547
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:55,040
因為你所在的部門 對於預防暴力
Because your Ministry for the Prevention of Vice

548
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,020
和提倡美德的做法
and the Encouragement of Virtue

549
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:01,220
聽起來和之前塔利班的手段很像
sounds a lot like the Taliban's old Ministry of Vice and Virtue.

550
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,230
你認為呢？
Don't you think?

551
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:15,940
金姆·貝克
- Kim Baker. - Mmm-hmm.

552
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:22,240
當塔利班掌權的時候
When the Taliban was in power,

553
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,940
他們有自己的伊斯蘭教法
they enforced their version of sharia.

554
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,310
其中一條法令規定
One of their edicts was a rule that

555
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:29,050
所有的男子必須剃光陰毛
all men must shave the hair of their pubis.

556
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,920
他們會帶著一小把 木質標尺上大街
They would walk the streets carrying a small wooden rod,

557
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,650
像個木釘
a dowel,

558
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:38,060
然後用它在男人的褲子上滾動
which they would roll along the front of a man's trousers.

559
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:42,400
如果某個男人的陰毛 長到影響了木釘的滾動
If a man's pubic hair was long enough to curl around the dowel,

560
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:45,730
他們就會打他
they would beat him.

561
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:47,960
現在，我問你
Now, I ask you,

562
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,410
我看起來像是那種
do I look like a man to walk the streets

563
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,140
會帶著木釘上街的人嗎？
carrying a hair-of-the-pubis dowel?

564
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,910
不，先生，你不像
No, sir, you do not.

565
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,240
我回到這個國家是為了拯救它
I returned to this country to save it.

566
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,620
我是美國的朋友
I am a friend of America.

567
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,160
所以你才更應該讓我採訪你啊
Which is why you should let me interview you,

568
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,420
這樣大家才能明白這點
so people can understand that.

569
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,660
金姆，我很喜歡你
I like you, Kim.

570
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,750
我喜歡你叫囂
I like your mouthiness.

571
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,530
- 這詞沒說錯吧？ - 沒錯，沒錯
That is a word, yes?

572
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,530
這讓我回想起了住在倫敦的時候
It reminds me of my time living in London.

573
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:23,130
你讓我又找了年輕的感覺
You make me feel like a young man again.

574
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,970
但我不瞭解你
But I do not know you.

575
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:31,210
我們怎麼才能互相瞭解，金姆？
How can we get to know each other, Kim?

576
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:34,880
嗯？
Hmm?

577
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,950
對，棒極了，金姆！
Yes, excellent, Kim!

578
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,730
給她戴塊穆斯林頭巾 她就能成為一個帥氣的男孩了
Put a turban on her, she'd make a very handsome boy.

579
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,060
你好嗎？你在那邊還好嗎？
<i>How are you? You okay there?</i>

580
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,230
那是什麼聲音？
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

581
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:29,430
可能這附近有人辦婚禮吧
It's probably just a wedding somewhere nearby.

582
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:31,410
他們喜歡在婚禮上鳴槍慶祝
They like to shoot off guns at weddings here.

583
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,030
你知道的，你可是弗羅裏達人
You get it, you're from Florida.

584
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,610
有意思
<i>Funny.</i>

585
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,080
我上一次見你是什麼時候了？
<i>When was the last time I saw you?</i>

586
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,580
6月？
<i>Since June?</i>

587
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:40,170
抱歉我上個月沒回去
I'm sorry that I didn't get back last month.

588
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,220
我週四會在紐約
I can be in New York by Thursday.

589
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,280
我很想你，也很想見你，而且我...
I miss you and I want to see you. And I...

590
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,760
我得...
I have...

591
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:49,790
又停電
Oh, not again.

592
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,930
我討厭這該死的機場
I hate this fucking airport.

593
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,520
要我從紐約給你們帶點什麼嗎？
Can I bring you guys anything from New York?

594
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:00,040
給我們帶份6罐精選紅酒就行了
Just bring us back a six pack, eh?

595
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,570
- 我是金姆 - 金姆·貝克？
- This is Kim. <i>- Kim Baker?</i>

596
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,710
我是薩迪克
It is Sadiq.

597
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,970
薩迪克先生，嗨
Mr. Sadiq, hi.

598
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:11,480
採訪一次巴夏·汗怎麼樣？
How about an interview with Pacha Khan?

599
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,310
巴夏·汗，那個軍閥？
Pacha Khan, the warlord?

600
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:15,080
巴夏·汗是個商人
<i>Pacha Khan is a businessman.</i>

601
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,980
你願意嗎？
Would you like that?

602
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,490
好，行啊，但我現在 正在去紐約，見我男朋友的路上
Uh, yeah. Yeah. But I'm on my way to New York to see my boyfriend.

603
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,890
你會成為從蘇維埃戰爭之後
<i>You will be the first Western journalist</i>

604
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:25,230
採訪他的第一個西方記者
<i>to interview him since the Soviet War.</i>

605
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:28,430
明天怎麼樣？
<i>Shall we say tomorrow?</i>

606
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:37,170
好，行，當然，謝謝
Okay, yes, of course. Thank you.

607
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,010
- 怎麼了？ - 回車裏去
- What? - Back in the car.

608
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,080
在這等著
Wait here.

609
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,180
（達裏語）

610
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,520
沒事了，來吧
It's okay, come.

611
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:19,470
（帕施圖語）

612
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,110
她是穆斯林嗎？
She is a Muslim?

613
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,720
對
Yes.

614
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,560
她有為我禱告嗎？
Have her pray for me.

615
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,430
巴夏·汗，她是個土耳其人
She is Turkish.

616
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,840
反正你也聽不懂她的話
You wouldn't understand her anyway.

617
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,140
嗯
Hmm.

618
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,320
- 好，可以了 - 好！
- Okay. Yes. - Yeah?

619
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,410
好
Okay.

620
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:06,050
巴夏·汗，謝謝您的盛情款待
Pacha Khan, thank you for your kind hospitality.

621
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,150
（啪施圖語）

622
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:10,600
給她戴塊穆斯林頭巾 她就能成為一個帥氣的男孩了！
Put a turban on her and she would make a handsome boy!

623
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,110
怎麼了？
What?

624
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:26,880
沒什麼
No.

625
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,220
金姆，祝賀
Oh, Kim. Cheers.

626
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,580
嗨
Hi.

627
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,710
感覺很棒吧？
What a rush, yeah?

628
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:36,750
巴夏·汗？是啊 感覺腎上腺素飆升，大家都...
Pacha Khan, yeah. It's like, adrenaline. Everyone was...

629
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:38,230
好極了
Good job.

630
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,590
是啊，挺順利的
Yeah, it went well.

631
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:42,760
但，你知道，我...我當時...
But, you know, I was... I was in the...

632
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,730
正坐在回家的新西蘭航空的飛機上
The New Zealand SAS back home.

633
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:47,300
而今天就像跳飛機一樣
And today felt like jumping out of an airplane.

634
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:50,770
或者說，你知道的，就像做愛
Or like, you know, like having sex.

635
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,570
金姆！
Kim!

636
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:00,750
譚雅買了威士忌 那個不會持續太久，所以...
Tanya's got scotch. It won't last long, so...

637
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:04,750
尼克，我們也歡迎你，大混球！
Nic, you're welcome, too, you big cunt!

638
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,120
對了，這其實是個親昵的詞
That's a term of affection, by the way.

639
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,890
小賤人，你這時候不是應該在紐約嘛
You were supposed to be in New York, sneaky girl.

640
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:17,060
是啊，克裏斯真的超級不爽
Yeah, Chris is not super pleased.

641
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,470
克裏斯肯定氣炸了
Chris can suck a fat one.

642
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,400
我想看看他們有沒有刊登我的故事
I'm trying to see if they put my story up,

643
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,840
但是網絡一直連接不上！
but this Internet connection is the worst!

644
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,000
見鬼，賈維德！
Oh, Goddamn it, Jaweed!

645
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,240
天吶！
Oh, Christ!

646
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,140
真的嗎？
- Really? - Wow.

647
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,480
不過，話說回來
Although, donkeys aside,

648
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:33,810
他是個很棒的中間人
- he's a good fixer. - Mmm.

649
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:38,450
不了，謝謝，還要準備早間節目
Oh, no, thanks. Morning shows.

650
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:41,020
你有他們早上想看到的東西？
You have something they want for the mornings?

651
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,430
也許吧，我不知道，可能吧
Maybe. I don't know. Maybe.

652
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,650
嗯
Hmm.

653
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,430
那是我想弄明白的事
That's what I'm trying to see.

654
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:53,000
你知道，我聽說他已經聯繫上了部落
You know, I heard that he has contacts in the Tribals.

655
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:55,870
和真正的塔利班份子聯繫上了
Like real Taliban contacts.

656
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,040
- 賈維德？ - 賈維德
- Jaweed? - Jaweed.

657
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,870
- 不會吧 - 顯然啊
- No fucking way. - Mmm, apparently.

658
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,940
你會幹嗎？你會去那嗎？
Would you do that? Would you go down there?

659
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,290
是啊，當然，只要時機合適
Yeah, sure, if it was the right call.

660
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,790
是啊，但你怎麼知道時機合不合適？
Yeah, but how do you know if it's the right call?

661
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,360
操，我也不知道
Fuck, man, I don't know.

662
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:20,520
這不就是我們為什麼喝酒，嗑藥
That is why we drink, do drugs

663
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:23,070
和陌生人在餐廳衛生間亂搞的原因嗎？
and shag strangers in restaurant bathrooms.

664
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:43,050
（克裏斯正在呼叫）

665
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,480
金姆，你沒事吧？怎麼了？
<i>Kim, are you okay? What's going on?</i>

666
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,580
天吶，抱歉，幾點了？
Oh, shoot. Oh, sorry, what time is it?

667
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,250
我不知道，我現在西雅圖
<i>I don't know. I'm in Seattle.</i>

668
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:52,390
老天，我還以為你在婚禮上中槍了呢
<i>God, I thought you got shot at a wedding or something.</i>

669
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:53,520
- 上帝啊，金姆！ - 沒有
<i>- Jesus, Kim!</i> - No.

670
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:55,560
抱歉，長話短說吧...
Sorry. So, just real quick...

671
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,900
我希望你來看我
I want you to come visit me.

672
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,200
去阿富汗看你？真的？
<i>In Afghanistan? Really?</i>

673
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,270
我積攢了很多里程
I mean, I've got tons of miles.

674
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,360
我可以給你買頭等艙的票
I could fly you first class.

675
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:02,600
我得看看日程，估計這個月沒戲
<i>I have to look at a calendar. I don't think I can do it this month.</i>

676
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,830
我要在這待到至少15號
<i>I'm here until, like, at least the 15th.</i>

677
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,040
不過，等我回去後，可能...
<i>But when I get back maybe...</i>

678
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,100
- 克裏斯，誰在你床上？ - 什麼？
- Who is in your bed, Chris? <i>- What?</i>

679
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:09,740
不，那是我的包
<i>No, that's my bag.</i>

680
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,010
自己看鏡子吧，人渣
Look in the mirror, dipshit.

681
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:16,750
老天，你這個混蛋 真不可思議，不可思議！
My God. You motherfucker. Unbelievable. Unbelievable!

682
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,190
你他媽的給我冷靜點！
<i>You calm the fuck down!</i>

683
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,020
聽著，你都幾個月沒在家了
<i>Listen, you haven't been home in months.</i>

684
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,250
你他媽連我的生日都忘了
<i>You forgot my fucking birthday!</i>

685
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:22,920
對，都是我的錯，好極了 克裏斯，你真是個天才
Oh, right, it's my fault. Great, Chris. You're a genius.

686
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,220
我還在幫你養那些愚蠢的植物
<i>And I kept your stupid fucking plants alive,</i>

687
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,860
而你卻讓我們之間的感情枯萎死亡
<i>but you let this relationship wither and die!</i>

688
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:31,930
這些臺詞都是你事先想好的嗎？
Ugh! Did you have that prepared?

689
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,030
- 什麼？ - 人渣！
<i>- What?</i> - Pussy!

690
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:34,400
知道嗎？祝你在西雅圖玩的愉快
You know what? Have fun in Seattle.

691
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,600
你應該去參觀搖滾博物館
You should go to the Rock 'n' Roll Museum.

692
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,040
那糟透了，正好適合你
It sucks. You'll fit right in.

693
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,460
你是在逗我嗎？
Are you shitting me?

694
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,260
法希姆
Fahim.

695
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:10,310
我們再申請一次植入吧
Let's apply for another embed.

696
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,570
因為我想離開喀布爾
Because I want to get out of Kabul.

697
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:15,910
我就是需要離開喀布爾
I just need to get out of Kabul.

698
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,810
我需要「自我放鬆」，沒錯
I need "me time", exactly. That's...

699
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,180
瞧？我早跟你說了，奧普拉雜誌
See? I told you that <i>O</i> magazine

700
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:24,260
能提升你對女人的理解
would increase your understanding of women.

701
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:37,530
嘿，你們是3-5部隊的吧？
Hey, you guys are 3-5, right?

702
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,500
你認識考夫林下士嗎？
Do you know a Corporal Coughlin?

703
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:40,590
不認識，女士
No, ma'am.

704
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:43,140
抱歉，我才來2個月
Sorry, but I've only been here for a couple months.

705
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
女士，如果你把一隻腳 放在另一隻腳的前面
Ma'am, if you set one foot in front of the other,

706
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:50,100
那當我們撞到簡易爆炸裝置時 你失去雙腿的可能性會更小
there's less chance you lose both feet if we hit an IED.

707
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:55,790
各位，準備
<i>Vides, make ready.</i>

708
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:04,350
老天，如果是這種戰爭
Man, we are definitely losing the war

709
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:06,620
那我們輸定了
when it comes to this particular well.

710
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,960
我對天發誓，他們又炸了一口井
I swear to God, they blow up another well,

711
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,230
我又弄丟了一雙鞋
I take another pair of boots off.

712
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,460
那他媽的就像搶椅子遊戲
It's like fucking musical chairs.

713
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:16,070
嘿，我要不要為你的婚禮買條禮服？
Hey, do I have to buy a dress for your wedding?

714
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,410
不用，在喀布爾，你穿什麼都行
No. Whatever you wear in Kabul is fine.

715
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:22,240
- 是嗎？ - 是的
- Yeah? - Yes.

716
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,980
我唯一的請求是 希望你確保我的朋友們能到場
The only thing I ask is that you make sure my friend is there.

717
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,980
你朋友就是我啊
Aw, your friend is me.

718
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:34,060
我明白了
I get it.

719
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,680
（帕施圖語）

720
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,770
- 趕緊的！ - 老天，斯特恩！
- Mount up! - Jesus, Stern!

721
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:35,780
將軍，抱歉，嘿，將軍，你有空嗎？
General, excuse me. Hey. General, do you have a minute?

722
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,290
- 現在不行，貝克 - 只是...
- Not now, Baker. - It's just...

723
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,590
這裏的井不是塔利班份子摧毀的
The Taliban haven't been destroying the well here.

724
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:44,250
而村子裏的女人們正在摧毀它
The women of the village are destroying it.

725
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,960
他們是這麼跟我說的
Or so they tell me.

726
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,500
我們為那些女人挖了好幾次那口井
We dug that well several times for the women

727
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:53,300
這樣她們就不用跋涉到河邊去
so they don't have to walk to the river.

728
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:55,130
但她們想到河邊去
But they want to walk to the river.

729
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:57,770
那是她們唯一能交友
It's their only chance to be social

730
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:00,140
聊天，你知道，一起聚聚的機會
and gossip and, you know, hang out.

731
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:02,940
我覺得她們有很多過去的蘇維埃地雷
I think that they have a bunch of old Soviet landmines,

732
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,140
她們只需要埋下一顆 再在上面扔個小石子
and they just prop one up and throw rocks at it.

733
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:21,630
金姆，你是否感覺 你在為那個關卡配備人手
Kim, did you ever feel like you're manning that tollgate

734
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:24,600
然後工程師喊著： 「我找到了生鐵，我找到了生鐵」
and the engineer's yelling, "I got pig iron, I got pig iron"?

735
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:28,270
不，我不明白這話是什麼意思 但聽著很有民間風味
No. I don't know what that means. But it's very folksy.

736
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:30,500
同時，那些女人顯然不希望男人們
Also, the women, obviously, they don't want the men

737
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,170
瞭解這一點，所以她們希望
to know about this, so they are hoping

738
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:34,840
你這一次會拒絕修理那口井
that you would just refuse to repair the well this time.

739
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:35,940
好吧，她們走運了
Well, they're in luck.

740
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,380
我正是這麼跟穆拉說的，所以...
That's exactly what I told the mullah, so...

741
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:42,610
幹的好，貝克
Well done, Baker.

742
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:44,890
呼呀，將軍
Hooyah, General.

743
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:48,520
陸戰隊員是說「嗚啦」
Marines say "Oorah."

744
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:50,820
海軍才說「呼呀」
The Navy says "Hooyah."

745
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,890
- 別把這倆混淆了 - 明白
- Don't mix those two up. - Got it.

746
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:55,690
祝你...祝你一路順風
Have a good... Have a good ride.

747
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:20,410
金姆
Kim.

748
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:24,380
金姆
Kim.

749
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:29,820
抱歉
Sorry.

750
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,270
- 你簡直美呆啦！ - 你才美的不行呢！
- You look beautiful! - You look beautiful!

751
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:46,370
天吶
Oh, my God.

752
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:53,420
- 天吶 - 噢，不！
- Oh, my God. - Oh, no!

753
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:54,860
金姆！
Kim!

754
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,960
什麼情況？
What the dick?

755
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:00,090
為什麼法希姆跟我說，我可以隨便穿？
Why did Fahim tell me I could dress like this?

756
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:02,690
他不希望你為此破費
Well, he didn't want you to have to go buy something.

757
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,560
老天，我都只洗了留海
Oh, my God. I only washed the front of my hair.

758
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:05,690
給，知道嗎？
Here. You know what?

759
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,200
我準備送給一個這個
I'm going to let you have one of these.

760
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:09,540
謝謝
Thank you.

761
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,200
現在我看起來棒極了
Now I look great.

762
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:12,470
現在你準備好了
Now you're ready.

763
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:13,640
現在我準備好派對了
Now I'm ready to party.

764
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:14,770
噢，她喜歡
Oh, she likes it.

765
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,710
- 當然 - 哇，那個...
- Sure. - Oh, wow. Well...

766
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,730
那比一字眉還糟 眉毛直接插進他頭髮裏了
It was worse than a unibrow. It went all the way into his hair.

767
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:41,970
我們之所以會在這
We all have some reason

768
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:43,130
都是出於某些原因的
for being here.

769
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:44,730
你的原因是什麼？
What's your reason?

770
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,830
你的呢？
What is yours?

771
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:47,240
我沒什麼好理由，我才剛到
I don't have a good one. I'm just here.

772
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:49,140
拜託，她剛都跟你講了 她的一字眉故事了
Come on, she just told her unibrow story.

773
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,610
我只是...我真的沒有
I just... I don't have one.

774
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:51,770
拜託
Come on.

775
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:57,990
有天晚上下班，我去了健身房 騎健身腳踏車
I was at the gym after work one night. Stationary bike.

776
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,320
每天都騎那同一輛車
Okay? The same bike every day.

777
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:04,090
然後我注意到
And I notice this

778
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:05,250
地毯上的壓痕
indentation in the carpet,

779
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,800
大概在我腳踏車前方一英尺
it's, like, a foot in front of my bike.

780
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:10,930
然後我發現那是我腳踏車原來的位置
And I realize that it's from where my bike used to be.

781
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:17,500
我已經在這輛車上騎了幾千公里了
I have done thousands of miles on this bike

782
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,600
結果我卻在倒退
and I have gone backwards.

783
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,940
毫不誇張的，我是在倒退
I have literally gone backwards.

784
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,210
我就是...
I just

785
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,940
想擺脫一切，我只想辭掉我的工作
wanted to blow everything up. I just wanted out of my job,

786
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:31,820
為百姓們寫點可讀的新聞
writing news scripts for dumb pretty people to read.

787
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,220
我希望...
I wanted...

788
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:36,290
不再去決定我是否應該
out of having to decide whether

789
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:39,630
嫁給我那個輕度抑鬱癥男友
I should just marry my mildly depressive boyfriend.

790
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,060
就這樣
And that's it.

791
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:44,670
我...我無法再直視
I just... I couldn't look at that

792
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:46,460
那塊該死的地毯了
fucking carpet anymore.

793
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:51,740
噢...
Oh...

794
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,980
好吧，事實上，這是我
Well, that is officially the most

795
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,240
聽過的最美國白人女性的故事
American white lady story I've ever heard.

796
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:01,680
- 得了吧 - 是真的
- Shut up. - It is.

797
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:03,050
知道嗎？去他媽的
You know what? Fuck that.

798
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:07,650
你是一個國外前線駐地記者
You are a battle-tested foreign correspondent.

799
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:11,020
你是一個頑強的喀布爾9.5
You're a solid Kabul 9.5.

800
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,390
而且你他媽還單身，對嗎？
And you are fucking single, all right?

801
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:16,400
所以，健身房的那個女人 她已經死了
So that lady back at the gym, she's dead.

我之前也說過，我們本可以 在電話裏完成這次談話
As I said, we could have done this over the phone.

818
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,440
我只是想找一份關於坎大哈的 伊斯蘭教法的聲明
I'm just looking for a statement on sharia in Kandahar.

819
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:29,400
我得知，你已經和你特別的朋友
I understand that you are no longer

在阿富汗發生的事

很少
Very little.

00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:41,750
我能給你看點東西嗎？
May I show you something?

826
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:42,910
當然
Of course.

827

你的辦公室裏有張床
You have a bed in your office.

這裏有張床
There is a bed here now.

那麼，對於坎大哈的伊斯蘭教法 不做評論還是...
So, no comment on sharia in Kandahar or...

831
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:07,680
無可奉告
No comment.

832
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:10,210
- 我們待會兒要去維和部隊嗎？ - 我不知道
- We are going to ISAF later, yes? - I don't know.

833

記者和爆炸的梗，誰在乎呢？
Pressers and "right of boom" crap. Who cares?

834
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:14,140
我們需要來點冒險，好嗎？
We need to enterprise something. Okay?

835
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:16,280
我們需要走出泡沫
We need to get out of the bubble.

- My point. - Let's go. Bullshit.

840
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:27,150
金姆，你知道，你那個鄉村水井的故事 之所以有吸引力
You know, Kim, the reason that your village well story got traction is

841
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:29,790
不是因為它很轟動 而是因為它關乎女性權益
because it wasn't a bang-bang, it was about women's rights.

842
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:31,660
那是篇很棒的文章
It was a brilliant piece, that.

843
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,000
見鬼
Oh, fucking hell.

844
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:35,370
我們應該去坎大哈
We should go to Kandahar.

845
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:36,630
不，太危險了
No, too dangerous.

846
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,900
不行，聽說那裏最近發生了液體洩漏
No way. It's a wee bit fluid down there these days,

847
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,140
安全起見
security-wise.

848
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,970
對，對你來說可能太冒險了 對吧，尼克？
Yeah, it might be a bit much for you, eh, Nic?

849
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:43,040
你這想法有點遲了
You're a bit late to the whole.

850
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:44,710
坎大哈現在已經成了屎坑了 知道嗎？
"Kandahar's gone to shit" party. You know?

851
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,750
那等伊斯蘭教法恢復 那女人們怎麼辦？
What about the woman thing where the sharia law is back?

852
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,480
而且那天，那裏還發生了燃燒彈爆炸
And there was a firebombing there the other day.

853
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:49,580
對，我覺得這值得冒險
Yeah, I think it's worth the risk.

854
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,380
伊安，夥計，你說的輕巧
Iain, that's easy for you to say, mate,

855
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:54,320
穿著你的泳衣躺在那 給該死的花園拍照片
sitting there in your cozzie taking photos of the fucking garden.

856
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:56,720
聽著，尼克，我知道你受過專門訓練
Look, Nicky, I know you've been specially trained

857
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:59,490
用於保護新西蘭的什麼來著 見鬼的海豚？
to protect New Zealand from, what, fucking dolphins?

858
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,920
但我其實不是沒去過戰區的 知道嗎？
But I'm not exactly a war zone virgin, you know?

859
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:04,660
我曾在AIG還叫AIG的時候 被他們綁架過
I was kidnapped by the AIG when they were still called that.

860
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,170
為什麼是海豚？
Why dolphins?

861
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:08,370
海豚和新西蘭有什麼關係
What do dolphins got to do with New Zealand?

862
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:09,410
沒關係，我只是...
Nothing to do with it. I'm just...

863
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,670
白色指針和鯊魚
White pointers and sharks,

864
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:11,760
但海豚從沒傷害過任何人
but the dolphins never hurt anyone.

865
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:14,280
夥計，我知道它們不傷人 我只是想說明...
I know they've not hurt anyone, mate. I'm just making the point...

866
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:15,610
我不會通過保護一種
I'm not gonna protect my country

867
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,440
從不傷人的動物來保護祖國
from an animal that hasn't hurt anyone.

868
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:18,710
老天
Oh, Jesus Christ.

869
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,710
海豚？開玩笑
Dolphins? What a joke.

870
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:23,380
如果車裏還坐的下，我可以跟你去
I'll come with you in the car if there's room.

871
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,180
那太好了，我們要去坎大哈了
Oh, great, we're all going to Kandahar!

872
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:30,690
我先打幾個電話 咱們可以開我的車去
I can make some calls. We can take my car.

873
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:33,260
金姆，如果我們要去坎大哈
Kim, if we are going to Kandahar,

874
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:35,760
你會需要買些新衣服
you will need to buy some new clothes.

875
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,530
不行...
I can't...

876
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,710
漂亮極了，我甚至都不想選舉了
Ah! It's so pretty, I don't even want to vote.

877
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:19,770
我現在其實在裏面朝你做鬼臉
I'm flipping you the bird in here right now.

878
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:22,340
- 法希姆，這是你的車嗎？ - 是啊
- Is this your car, Fahim? - Yes.

879
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:23,810
這簡直就是一堆破爛啊
This is a fucking piece of shit.

880
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,640
我覺得挺好的啊
I think it's very nice.

881
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:32,320
沒人在盯著我看，好奇怪
No one is staring at me. It's weird.

882
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:35,260
你現在處於藍色的監牢內
You are in the Blue Prison now.

883
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:10,390
法希姆，這些塗鴉寫的是什麼？
Fahim, what does the graffiti say?

884
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:12,990
「女人不許受教育」
"No education for woman."

885
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,800
br伊安
- Brian. - Huh?

886
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:42,360
法希姆，那邊發生了什麼？
Fahim, what's going on up there?

887
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:46,660
塔利班以前經常這樣
The Taliban used to do this.

888
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:50,060
處決收音機和電視
Execute the radios and televisions.

889

（達裏語）

890
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:56,070
見鬼！
Oh, shit!

891
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,860
（達裏語）

892
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:01,900
讓開！
Get out of the way!

893
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,270
讓讓，讓讓！
Move on! Move on!

894
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:05,680
你們不能出去，我可以
You guys can't go out there, but I can.

895
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:09,420

901
00:54:56,590 --> 00:54:58,400
金姆，快，我們必須快點 我們必須快點
Kim, now. We must hurry. We must hurry.

902
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:15,470

Get in the car!

903
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,850
快離開這！
Get out of here!

904
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:26,330
那是男人的場地，金姆 只有男人能去！
That was a men's park, Kim! Men only!

905
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:29,160
操！
Fuck!

貝卡希德，法希姆
<i>Bebakhshid,</i> Fahim.

coalition capacity,

908
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:43,800
優先權和支持
priorities and support.

909
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:48,640
我們現在來看看排行前12的 通行貨比
Let's look now at the 12 first-tier drivers in the current COIN paradigm.

910
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:50,280
該死
Shit.

911
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:52,190
戰術和制度性
Tactical and institutional...

912
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,520
總是難以執行
is always in purple,

913
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:54,960
沒有像這樣...
and noting as such...

914
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:57,120
金姆·貝克
Kim Baker.

915
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:58,560
先生，你現在有空嗎？
Sir, do you have a minute?

916
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:00,530
如果我能聽懂簡要內容
If I'm understanding this briefing,

917
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:02,330
那我有的是時間
I have all the fucking time in the world.

918
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:04,800
好吧，我今天去了坎大哈
Okay. Well, I'm covering the girls' school

919
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:06,200
被燃燒彈燒燬的女校
in Kandahar that was firebombed

920
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:09,360
我在想，你是否能為我提供些參考
and I'm wondering if you could give me something, on background,

921
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:12,870
就關於這裏的安全形勢
just about the security situation here

922
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:14,810
和總體的戰況
and the state of the war in general.

923
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,380
對，我可以給你些參考
Yeah, I can give you something.

924
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:17,880
這場戰場就像一隻大猩猩
This war is like fucking a gorilla.

925
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:20,140
除非大猩猩想停 否則你就要一直打下去
You keep going till the gorilla wants to stop.

926
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:23,150
我覺得我能聽懂這句的意思
I think I can paraphrase that.

927
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,590
趕緊離開那
<i>Knock yourself out.</i>

928
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:44,400
你知道，阿富汗生產的鴉片類麻醉劑 佔全世界比重的90%
You know, Afghanistan produces 90% of the world's narcotic opiates.

929
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:45,910
他們也是這麼說的
- So they say. - Mmm.

930
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:49,910
我在醫院工作的時候
When I worked in the hospital,

931
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,010
這些男人，海洛因依賴者
these men, heroin addicts,

932
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:55,850
會帶一個孩子來
would come in with a child.

933
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:58,680
他們說，「噢，我兒子摔斷了胳膊」
They'd say, "Oh, my son, he broke his arm."

934
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,220
在我們照顧孩子的時候
And while we were tending to the child,

935
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,520
那些男人就會偷我們的嗎啡
the men would steal our morphine.

936
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:09,390
然後我們會開始猜測 這胳膊是怎麼斷的
And we would wonder how the arm got broken to begin with.

937
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:11,630
法希姆，你想說的是什麼？
What are we talking about, Fahim?

938
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:13,960
嗯
Hmm.

939
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:18,270
人體會產生自身的海洛因
The human body produces its own heroin.

940
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,640
事實上，爭鬥或逃避的直覺
In fact, when the fight-or-flight instinct

941
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:22,940
是作用於下丘腦的
is activated in the hypothalamus,

942
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:28,040
你的身體會釋放內啡肽 多巴胺和降腎上腺素
your body releases endorphins, dopamine and norepinephrine.

943
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:33,780
那就好比是同時攝入海洛因，可卡因 和安非他明
That is heroin, cocaine and amphetamine, all at once.

944
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:37,420
好吧，我們這段阿富汗式的對話
Okay, great. Are we having the Afghan version of this conversation,

945
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:38,590
如果在紐約，是否就能
where in New York we would have

946
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,160
在5分鐘前，就已經明白意思了？
gotten to the point, like, five minutes ago?

947
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:46,560
我們有理由相信一個人
There is a reason to believe that a person

948
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:49,160
會沉迷於這種興奮
can get addicted to this type of high.

949
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,640
士兵，運動員...
Soldiers, athletes...

950
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:54,680
戰地記者，明白
War reporters. Got it.

951
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:59,470
一種癮對劑量的需要總是會越來越大
An addict always needs a greater and greater dosage.

952
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:03,450
然後人們就會犯錯，會受傷
And then people make mistakes, people get hurt.

953
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:06,460
我明白了，你剛結婚，我也許
I get it. You're a newlywed. I can

954
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:09,080
可以讓他們每天得到125美金
probably get them to go up to $125 a day.

955
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,530
咱們還是
Let us have the

956
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:23,200
用美國的方式來談話吧
American version of this conversation.

957
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,700
好吧
Okay.

958
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:29,310
我已經不想再和你合作了
I do not want to work with you anymore.

959
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:31,640
不，好，等等，法希姆 我知道我搞砸了
No, okay, wait. Fahim, I know I fucked up.

960
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:34,180
我覺得你不知道
I do not think you do.

961
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:36,450
- 聽我說 - 金姆，不
- Hear me out. - Kim, no.

962
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:41,890
我剛結婚，我想生孩子
I am now married. I want to have children.

963
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:43,980
那種事不會再發生了，不會了...
It will not happen again. It's not gonna...

964
00:58:44,050 --> 00:58:49,060
我以為自己在追一頭鹿 結果發現自己正在被一隻鬣狗追
"I ride after a deer and find myself chased by a hog."

965
00:58:49,790 --> 00:58:51,500
「我計劃了我想要的
"I plot to get what I want"

966
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:54,330
結果卻進了監獄
"and I end up in prison."

967
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:57,900
我挖陷阱想誘捕他人 結果自己卻落入其中
"I dig pits to trap others and I fall in."

968
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:01,400
我應該懷疑我想要的是否正確」
"I should be suspicious of what I want."

969
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:04,970
我不明白這話的意思
I don't know what that means.

970
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,580
你明白
You do.

971
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:18,750
法希姆？
Fahim?

972
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:03,630
我在這有些呼吸不過來了
I can't breathe in here.

973
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:05,970
該去散個步了
Time to take a walk.

974
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:08,140
我得到外面去
I have to go outside.

975
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:10,810
我得回家
I have to go home.

976
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,240
（達裏語）

977
01:00:16,370 --> 01:00:19,080
戴上你的頭巾
Put on your headscarf.

978
01:00:35,930 --> 01:00:37,130
該死
Shit.

979
01:00:37,230 --> 01:00:38,570
走錯門了
It's the wrong house.

980
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,180
見鬼
Oh, shit.

981
01:01:08,590 --> 01:01:10,500
金姆？
Kim?

982
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,340
你在幹嘛呢？
What the hell are you doing?

983
01:01:16,370 --> 01:01:17,610
給
Here.

984
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:21,670
金姆，喝點水，好嗎？你沒事吧？
Kim, sip that. Okay? You all right?

985
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:25,780
繼續喝，沒事的，都沒事了
Keep sipping that. You're all right. It's okay.

986
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,190
沒事了，嘿
It's okay. Hey.

987
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:29,320
嘿，都沒事了
Hey, it's all right.

988
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:32,450
喂，有點意思啊
Oi. Now, that there was a bit of fun.

989
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:33,860
- 你有病啊？ - 好吧，夥計...
- Are you mental? - Okay, mate...

990
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:35,360
我不是你的夥計，我再問你一遍
I'm not your mate. I'm gonna ask you again,

991
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:36,490
你他媽的有病嗎？
are you fucking mental?

992
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:39,830
- 算了，伊安，那不是他的錯 - 你的職責是什麼？
- Come on, lain, it's not his fault. - What's your job again? Hmm?

993
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:41,460
因為如果我因為 從一個日本旅行作家那
Because if I hadn't come back to see you lot

994
01:01:41,530 --> 01:01:42,660
偷了一瓶清酒
because I stole a bottle of sake

995
01:01:42,730 --> 01:01:43,800
而沒有回來找你...
from a Japanese travel writer...

996
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:44,970
等等，你有清酒？
Wait, you have sake?

997
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:46,510
你可能會害死她，夥計！
you could've killed her, "mate!"

998
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:48,170
滾開
Oh, fuck off.

999
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:51,970
老天！媽的！
Jesus! What the fuck?

1000
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:53,810
夥計，你他媽的幹什麼？
Dude, what the fuck?

1001
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:56,040
你他媽的剛是揍了我嗎？
Did you fucking sucker punch me?

1002
01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:57,550
你弄斷了我的鼻子
You broke my nose.

1003
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:00,250
- 你他媽的是美國人嗎？ - 你是美國佬嗎？
- You fucking American? - Are you a Yank?

1004
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:02,260
我是加拿大人，混蛋
- I'm Canadian, you asshole. - Ugh.

1005
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:04,350
我差點和一個加拿大人上床了？
I almost fucked a Canadian?

1006
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:07,330
我要是你，就躺著不動，孬種
I'd stay down if I were you, ya wee cunt.

1007
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:09,520
這不是什麼親昵的詞
And that's not a term of affection.

1008
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:12,000
媽的
Fuck that.

1009
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:24,910
天吶！
Oh, God! Mmm.

1010
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:28,220
噢！
Ow!

1011
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,540
- 等等 - 操
- Wait. - Oh, fuck.

1012
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:33,280
伊安，別抱著我走啊，我又不是嬰兒
Iain, don't carry me around. I'm not a fucking baby.

1013
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,250
見鬼
- Ah! - Goddamn it.

1014
01:02:36,350 --> 01:02:38,020
你在幹什麼？
What the fuck are you doing?

1015
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:45,230
- 脫掉 - 我在努力脫掉！
- Take it off. - I'm fucking trying to take it off!

1016
01:02:45,290 --> 01:02:47,530
老天，我要用力地干你
Oh, God, I'm gonna put it in you so fucking hard,

1017
01:02:47,590 --> 01:02:48,940
- 一定讓你爽翻天 - 噓，別出聲
- you're gonna fucking get it. - Shh. Don't talk.

1018
01:02:49,030 --> 01:02:50,100
我想要你嘴裏的一切
I want everything in your mouth.

1019
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,230
伊安，閉嘴
Iain, just shut it.

1020
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,940
我帶你躺下，來
I'll take you lying down, come on.

1021
01:02:54,030 --> 01:02:56,740
你有那種奇小的陰莖嗎？
Do you have one of those weird little penises?

1022
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,940
不！我喜歡這種姿勢
No! This is how I want to go.

1023
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:01,070
不，我不想看見自己
No, I don't want to see myself.

1024
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:02,710
走開！
Roll off!

1025
01:03:02,810 --> 01:03:04,810
好吧，舔它
Okay, fuck it.

1026
01:03:06,910 --> 01:03:09,550
老天，我真他媽的...
Oh, God, I fucking...

1027
01:03:09,610 --> 01:03:10,650
你在幹嘛？
What are you doing?

1028
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:13,160
我只是把手指放進你的嘴裏
I'm just putting my fucking finger in your mouth.

1029
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:14,250
噓，不！
Shh. No!

1030
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:15,390
來吧，用你的嘴吞下全部
Come on, just put everything in your mouth.

1031
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:19,130
你想走了嗎？
Do you want me to go?

1032
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:20,500
不
No.

1033
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:36,950
你下面的毛毛很蓬鬆
There's aught like a good shag.

1034
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,450
好吧，我們都成熟點
Okay, let's try to be adults here.

1035
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:41,110
我覺得我們很成熟啊
I think we were.

1036
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:44,260
顯然，這只是一時衝動，對嗎？
Obviously this was just a Kabubble thing, right?

1037
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,350
當我們
Just a

1038
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:49,330
其中一人高潮時，那只是個有趣的錯誤
fun mistake where one of us had an orgasm.

1039
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:52,870
我是說，我們倆當時都很火大 然後你就
I mean, we're both in a really bad place. And then you

1040
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:55,360
揍了尼克
punched Nic.

1041
01:03:55,830 --> 01:03:57,530
我不知道，是內啡肽在作祟，對嗎？
I don't know. It's endorphins, right?

1042
01:03:59,030 --> 01:04:00,510
不，不是
Nope, that's not what this is.

1043
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,310
不，你不用獻慇勤
No, you don't need to be gallant.

1044
01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:04,140
我是認真的
I'm serious.

1045
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:08,310
我很喜歡你，金姆·貝克
I fancy you, Kim Baker.

1046
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:10,210
真的
I do.

1047
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:14,380
這個國家有那麼多的女人 我偏偏選了你
Of all the dozens of women in this country, I chose you.

1048
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,290
不，你沒有，因為這不是我
No, you didn't, because this is not me.

1049
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:17,450
是我絕對不會幹出這種事
I would never do this.

1050
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:20,120
確切地說，正因為你已經不再是你了
Precisely. Because you're not you anymore.

1051
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:22,170
你是一時衝動，你自己也說了
You're in the Kabubble. You said so yourself.

1052
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:24,560
別躲起來
Don't fucking hide.

1053
01:04:25,890 --> 01:04:28,390
金姆，你聽說過溫水煮青蛙嗎？
Kim, you know the frog in the pot of water?

1054
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:31,630
你一點一點地升高溫度
You raise the temperature bit by bit,

1055
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:33,330
而青蛙並沒有意識到這點
the frog doesn't notice?

1056
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,810
那就是這個地方
That's what this place

1057
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:37,850
和這份工作對我們的所作所為
and that's what this job does to all of us.

1058
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:41,410
它改變了你以前對正常的知覺
It changes your perception of what's normal until...

1059
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:45,010
直到我們變成這樣
until here we are.

1060
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:47,890
你知道青蛙最終
You know the frog boils to death

1061
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:49,550
- 被煮死了，對吧？ - 不
- at the end of that, right? - Nope.

1062
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:50,850
- 是 - 不
- Yeah. - Nope.

1063
01:04:57,990 --> 01:04:59,990
那是我的牙刷嗎？
Is that my toothbrush?

1064
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:01,400
Ugh!

1065
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:05,110
艾德，我坎大哈的那篇報道 是怎麼回事？
<i>What's going on with my Kandahar piece, Ed?</i>

1066
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,700
傑瑞封殺了它
<i>Jerry killed it.</i>

1067
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:07,770
等等，誰？
Wait, who killed it?

1068
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:10,370
傑瑞·陶布，網絡總監啊，金姆
<i>Jerry Taub, head of the network, Kim.</i>

1069
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:12,210
- 安吉拉人呢？ - 她走了
- What happened to Angela? <i>- She left.</i>

1070
01:05:12,270 --> 01:05:15,550
她現在正在為女性還是什麼的 運營一個網站
<i>She's running a website for women or something.</i>

1071
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:19,380
聽著，在週一的會議上 我沒辦法打阿富汗的牌
<i>Look, I can't sell Afghanistan in Monday meetings.</i>

1072
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:22,790
你的戰地報道變得有些冗長 而且每天都一樣
<i>Your war's got chronic same-shit-different-day-itis.</i>

1073
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:25,230
好極了，艾德，那我還在這幹什麼？
Great. What am I even doing here, Ed?

1074
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:28,560
金姆，這個我就不問了
<i>I wouldn't ask that too loudly, Kim.</i>

1075
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:32,230
我想你應該會很高興 能回到你昔日的辦公桌邊吧
<i>Though I'd be thrilled to have you back at your old desk.</i>

1076
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:39,560
我說完了
That's all I got.

1077
01:05:43,030 --> 01:05:46,410
嘿，我聽說尼克不幹了 你還和伊安上了床！
Hey, I heard that Nic quit and you fucked Iain!

1078
01:05:46,470 --> 01:05:47,540
等等
Whoa, hold on.

1079
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:49,880
聽著，伊安的事不要再提了，好嗎？
Listen, the Iain thing is not a thing, okay?

1080
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:52,080
我們手的大小相同，我不能
We have the same size hands. I can't.

1081
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:54,780
只是工作讓你有些崩潰
It's just work has been a little frustrating.

1082
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:55,910
我能理解
Yeah. I get it.

1083
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:57,760
因為阿富汗的新聞已經不叫座了
Because Afghanistan doesn't rate anymore.

1084
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:59,260
胡扯
That is bullshit.

1085
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:00,920
寶貝，你在這找到了自己的幸運
You've got to find your own luck here, babe,

1086
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:02,260
你知道的
you know that.

1087
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:06,460
怎麼了？
What?

1088
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:09,170
怎麼？那是什麼？
What? What is that?

1089
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:11,640
嘿！你正在部落和譚雅聯繫？
Hey! You're hooking up Tanya in the Tribals?

1090
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:13,140
賈維德，你搞什麼？
What the fuck, Jaweed?

1091
01:06:13,230 --> 01:06:14,900
她的網站會付給我三倍的薪水
Her network will pay me triple.

1092
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,840
我教過你怎麼清楚網絡瀏覽記錄吧？
I taught you how to clear your Internet history, okay?

1093
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:18,510
范德普爾以前對你做過什麼？
What has Vanderpoel ever done for you?

1094
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:19,980
夥計，給我消停會兒吧
Give me a break, man.

1095
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:22,180
我不管，你欠我的，你還有什麼？
Whatever. You owe me. What else do you have?

1096
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:23,340
你是吉爾扎伊人，對嗎？ （阿富汗帕坦人的一支）
You're Ghilzai, right?

1097
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:24,850
你和吉爾扎伊家族的其他成員
Do you have any other connections

1098
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:26,290
有什麼聯繫嗎？
to members of the Ghilzai family?

1099
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:27,980
- 你是說希克馬蒂亞爾嗎？ - 也許
- You mean Hekmatyar? - Maybe.

1100
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:30,360
金姆，你瘋了嗎？拜託
Are you fucking crazy, Kim? Please.

1101
01:06:31,950 --> 01:06:33,660
嘿！納比奧，嘿
Hey! Nabil! Hey.

1102
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:35,590
你跟ISI的，說他知道
Are you still in touch with that ISI guy

1103
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:38,290
誰殺了阿卜杜爾·哈克的那個人有聯繫嗎？
who says he knows who killed Abdul Haq?

1104
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:41,100
那個人？他兩年前就死了
That guy? He's dead two years.

1105
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:55,780
嘿
Hey.

1106
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:06,190
噢，天啊
Oh, for fuck's sake.

1107
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:07,630
麥克凱爾皮夫人
Mrs. MacKelpie.

1108
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:13,190
兩次？
Twice?

1109
01:07:13,290 --> 01:07:14,240
其實是兩次半
Two and a half, actually.

1110
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:15,330
噢
Ugh!

1111
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:18,460
我不記得昨晚發生什麼了
I don't remember what happened last night.

1112
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:20,870
跟喀布爾那次一樣 我被溫水煮青蛙了
Kabul happened, my wee froggy in the pot.

1113
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:23,500
我戴頭巾了嗎？我的手機在哪？
Did I not wear a headscarf? Where's my phone?

1114
01:07:23,570 --> 01:07:24,670
我應該扔進壁櫥裏了
I believe I threw your mobile in my cupboard.

1115
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:25,840
為什麼？
Why?

1116
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:28,180
因為半途中你想打電話給譚雅
Because mid-coitus you tried to call Tanya

1117
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:30,340
說什麼部落裏的追鵝比賽
about some bloody wild goose chase in the Tribals.

1118
01:07:30,410 --> 01:07:31,720
我跟你說過那個？
I told you about that?

1119
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:32,880
嗯，你讓我把內褲塞你嘴裏後
Mmm. Well, it was hard to understand you

1120
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:35,580
我基本聽不清楚你想說什麼
once you asked me to stuff your knickers in your mouth.

1121
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:38,820
開玩笑的，金姆，沒有那回事
I'm joking, Kim. That didn't happen.

1122
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:40,760
見鬼，我...
Fuck. I am...

1123
01:07:40,850 --> 01:07:42,700
我要輸了
I am fucking losing it.

1124
01:07:43,250 --> 01:07:44,730
我需要個勝利
I need a win.

1125
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:45,890
天啊，要是你那麼堅持
Christ, if you're that hard up,

1126
01:07:45,990 --> 01:07:47,730
我可以把我在巴達克山的故事分享給你
I'll share my Badakhshan thing with you.

1127
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:49,200
什麼巴達克山的故事
What Badakhshan thing?

1128
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:51,870
你知道中國贏得了在那裏 挖金礦的合同
You know China won the contract to mine for gold up there.

1129
01:07:51,930 --> 01:07:54,430
他們建造公路，機場，房屋所有那一切
They built roads, airport, housing, all that.

1130
01:07:54,530 --> 01:07:56,570
猜猜保護紅色中國
Well, guess whose responsibility it is

1131
01:07:56,670 --> 01:07:58,580
在那動盪地區財產的責任
to protect the investment of Red China

1132
01:07:58,670 --> 01:08:00,550
在誰身上？
in this restive nation?

1133
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:04,680
美國士兵，中國黃金，噢，伊安 這故事太棒了
American troops, Chinese gold. Oh, Iain, that's really good.

1134
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:05,950
人們會氣死的
People are gonna get mad.

1135
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,890
我就等上面開綠燈了
Just waiting for my guy to give me the green light.

1136
01:08:08,010 --> 01:08:10,420
你付路費，我就把故事分享給你，簡單
You pay for the trip, I'll share the story with you. Easy peasy.

1137
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:13,220
真的？謝謝，那太...
Really? Thank you. That's...

1138
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:15,260
我欠你一次
I owe you one.

1139
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:18,200
剩下那半次呢？
Well, how about a half of one?

1140
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:19,560
我們可以補上算3次
And then we can make it an even three.

1141
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:21,760
好吧，或者我能請你吃早飯
Yeah. Or I could buy you breakfast.

1142
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:25,070
或者補上半次，我們就算3次扯平了
Or a half of one and we can make it an even three.

1143
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:28,110
我覺得早餐在金錢上有同樣的價值
I think breakfast is of equal monetary value.

1144
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,110
我的中名是歐漢
My middle name is Eoghan.

1145
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,270
是蘇格蘭語，閉嘴的意思
Which is Erse... Shut up.

1146
01:08:32,370 --> 01:08:33,940
「讓歐文閉嘴」
It's Erse for Owen.

1147
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:35,450
- 歐希？ - 嗯哼
- "Oo-hee"? - Mmm-hmm.

1148
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:37,450
- 伊安·歐希？ - 算了
- Iain "Oo-hee." - Don't bother.

1149
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:38,780
本拉登在哪？
Where is Bin Laden?

1150
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:39,910
人們以為他在巴基斯坦，對吧
People think he's in Pakistan, right?

1151
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:40,980
對
Yeah.

1152
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:42,790
你鬍子上有雞蛋，等等
You've got egg in your beard. Hang on.

1153
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:43,950
謝謝
Thank you.

1154
01:08:44,050 --> 01:08:46,760
你的國獸是獨角獸？
Your national animal is the unicorn.

1155
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:47,820
我覺得這挺浪漫
I think it's romantic.

1156
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,920
那是我8歲時統治的
That is the national animal of the kingdom I ruled

1157
01:08:49,990 --> 01:08:51,090
王國的國獸
when I was eight.

1158
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:53,160
三個臭皮匠你最喜歡誰
Who's your favorite Three Stooge?

1159
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:57,730
拉裏，因為他的風格我最認同
Um, Larry. Because he's put upon in a way that I identify with.

1160
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,280
他是個藝術狂對吧
He's the Art Garfunkel, right?

1161
01:09:00,330 --> 01:09:01,740
對
Yeah.

1162
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:04,800
所以我覺得我想跟你再一起呆一會
So, I thought I might like to hang out with you for a bit.

1163
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:06,470
好啊，好
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

1164
01:09:07,470 --> 01:09:08,970
你真的想知道我想做什麼嗎
Do you really want to know what I want to do?

1165
01:09:09,070 --> 01:09:10,020
想啊
Yeah. Okay.

1166
01:09:10,110 --> 01:09:11,450
我想親你
I'd like to kiss you.

1167
01:09:14,910 --> 01:09:16,080
誰猜得到呢
Who knew?

1168
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:21,620
這是我的小夥計
Here's my little man.

1169
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:23,830
不，伊安，這是騙局
No, Iain, don't. It's a scam.

1170
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:26,160
你這麼想嗎？真的？
Do you think so? Really?

1171
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:28,830
我知道這是不是騙局，金姆 可那又怎麼樣？
I know it's a scam, Kim. So what?

1172
01:09:28,930 --> 01:09:30,960
他還是在街上乞討 嘿，亞伯拉罕
He's still begging in the street. Hey, Abrahaim.

1173
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:33,270
好孩子
There's my boy.

1174
01:09:44,010 --> 01:09:45,780
我就知道能贏得你的心
I knew I'd win you over.

1175
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:52,520
天啊
Jesus!

1176
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:02,640
怎麼回事，賈維德？他們來不來？
What the fuck, Jaweed? Are they coming or not?

1177
01:10:03,290 --> 01:10:04,330
來了
Here they are.

1178
01:10:10,070 --> 01:10:11,210
他們來了
<i>There they are.</i>

1179
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:15,150
4-6800，北方6號線
4-6800, line six north.

1180
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:21,320
等待許可
Standing by approval.

1181
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:23,150
可以攻擊目標
We are clear to engage target.

1182
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:25,320
收到，可以攻擊目標
Roger. Clear to engage target.

1183
01:10:33,190 --> 01:10:34,760
是他，我的人
It is him. That's my guy.

1184
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:37,330
要是我們要去什麼地方 必須開自己的車
If we go anywhere, Jaweed, we take our vehicle.

1185
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:38,530
決不共用車子
No carpooling.

1186
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:39,770
好
All right. Okay.

1187
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:49,880
見鬼
Shit! Shit!

1188
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:52,020
冷靜
Stay calm.

1189
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:54,750
冷靜

1190
01:10:59,450 --> 01:11:00,450
命中
Splash.

1191
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:01,930
減弱激光
Cease laser. Safe laser.

1192
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:03,690
激光關閉，激光安全
Laser off. Laser safe.

1193
01:11:27,610 --> 01:11:29,960
我在找個人，不好意思
I'm looking for someone. Excuse me.

1194
01:11:37,390 --> 01:11:39,230
- 天啊，譚雅 - 嗨
- Oh, my God. Tanya. - Hi.

1195
01:11:39,290 --> 01:11:40,670
天啊
- Jesus. - Oy.

1196
01:11:42,290 --> 01:11:44,170
賈維德死了
Jaweed's dead.

1197
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,670
安迪在手術室
Andy's in surgery.

1198
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,110
我知道，伊安跟科林談過了
I know. Iain talked to Colin.

1199
01:11:47,230 --> 01:11:48,610
天啊
Jesus!

1200
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:50,080
我知道，這很操蛋
I know. It's fucked.

1201
01:11:52,470 --> 01:11:54,420
你知道，科林在拍
You know, Colin was rolling.

1202
01:11:55,810 --> 01:11:58,150
那種拍攝？你有帶子？
What, like, rolling-rolling? You have tape?

1203
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:00,420
整件事他都拍到了
He got the whole fucking thing.

1204
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:03,320
他們一讓我離開這我就要播出去
I'm going to go live with it as soon as they let me out of here.

1205
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:07,160
你能相信嗎
Can you fucking believe it?

1206
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:08,990
嘿
Hey.

1207
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:10,330
嗨
Hi.

1208
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:11,790
嗨
Aye.

1209
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:14,300
- 你好嗎 - 你還好嗎
- How are you? - You doing all right?

1210
01:12:16,090 --> 01:12:17,770
見鬼
Holy shit!

1211
01:12:17,830 --> 01:12:19,930
蘇珊娜，實際上在我們看的時候
<i>And as we watch it again there, Susanna,</i>

1212
01:12:20,030 --> 01:12:23,600
你能看到地獄火導彈爆炸之前的瞬間
<i>you can actually see the Hellfire missile right before it detonates.</i>

1213
01:12:28,170 --> 01:12:29,670
巴達克山怎麼了？
What is going on with Badakhshan?

1214
01:12:29,770 --> 01:12:32,020
啊，那雪簡直要命
Ah, snow's killing us.

1215
01:12:32,110 --> 01:12:33,280
除非你的檯曆
So unless your network wants

1216
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:34,950
想拿出坐直升機的錢
to stump up the money for the helicopter,

1217
01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:37,390
不然你就得等道路開放
we'll have to wait till they clear the passes.

1218
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:39,020
金姆，外面有點情況
Kim, we have a bit of a situation outside.

1219
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:40,120
噢
Oh.

1220
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:41,790
什麼
What?

1221
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:43,560
我只是需要你看個東西
I just need you to see something.

1222
01:12:43,690 --> 01:12:45,130
抱歉打擾了
Sorry to interrupt.

1223
01:12:45,190 --> 01:12:46,360
他說他要什麼了嗎
Did he say what he wanted?

1224
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:47,630
我不知道
I don't know.

1225
01:12:52,030 --> 01:12:53,370
操
Fuck.

1226
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:00,040
卡達爾，卡達爾，沒事，你能進去
Qadar. Qadar, it's okay. You can go in.

1227
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:01,480
他只是想跟我談談
He just wants to talk to me.

1228
01:13:01,570 --> 01:13:03,310
- 好了，好了 - 沒事
- Okay. Okay. - It's okay.

1229
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:05,880
求你了，看在我的份上別遮住頭髮
Oh, please, do not cover your hair on my account.

1230
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:07,320
這麼美麗的頭髮
It's such beautiful hair.

1231
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:09,590
簡直就像駿馬的鬃毛
It's like the hide of a fine horse.

1232
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:12,160
薩迪克，你在這幹什麼
Sadiq, what are you doing here?

1233
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:16,900
我剛關了一家妓院，正在回家路上
I was just going home from closing a woman brothel

1234
01:13:16,990 --> 01:13:19,060
我跟我的司機說
when I told my driver,

1235
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:23,540
馬勃布拉，這是我最好的朋友 金伯利住的地方
"Mahboobullah, this is where my best friend Kimberly lives!"

1236
01:13:23,590 --> 01:13:27,010
但她最近一直是壞朋友
But she has been a bad friend lately.

1237
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:29,840
她不來電話
She does not call.

1238
01:13:30,570 --> 01:13:33,240
不邀請我參加她的派對
She does not invite me to her party.

1239
01:13:33,570 --> 01:13:34,780
對不起
I'm sorry,

1240
01:13:34,870 --> 01:13:37,080
但我覺得阿富汗伊斯蘭共和國的
but I didn't think the Attorney General

1241
01:13:37,170 --> 01:13:39,380
司法部長應該不會去客人家
of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan

1242
01:13:39,510 --> 01:13:40,720
參加派對吧
went to parties at guesthouses.

1243
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:42,520
為什麼不會？
And why not?

1244
01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:44,690
我還是個人，不是嗎
I am still a man, no?

1245
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:46,700
我愛音樂
I love music.

1246
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:49,200
我愛跳舞
I love to dance!

1247
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:00,600
但是
But

1248
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:04,200
雖然你是壞朋友
even though you have been a bad friend,

1249
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,770
我還是想要你快樂
I want you to be happy.

1250
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:10,580
你有特別的朋友嗎
Do you have a special friend?

1251
01:14:11,710 --> 01:14:13,050
因為
Because.

1252
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:17,720
我很想當你特別的朋友
I would love to be your special friend.

1253
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:20,790
你願意嗎，金姆？
Would you like that, Kim?

1254
01:14:23,790 --> 01:14:25,170
你是壞朋友
You're a bad friend.

1255
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:28,130
你是個壞朋友
You are a bad friend.

1256
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:32,140
要在美國，我會把這些都寫成書
In America, I would get a book deal out of this shit!

1257
01:14:32,230 --> 01:14:34,300
你不能這樣，好嗎
You can't just do this, okay?

1258
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,570
我已經幾個月沒播出節目了
I haven't been on the air in months!

1259
01:14:36,630 --> 01:14:40,410
我最好的朋友差點死掉 我還在嫉妒她
My best friend here almost died, and I am jealous of her!

1260
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:42,310
我就是...
And I am just...

1261
01:14:43,070 --> 01:14:45,750
都去死吧，全都去死
Fuck this! All of it!

1262
01:15:09,930 --> 01:15:11,440
那是個炸彈
That was a bomb.

1263
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:14,510
你好，等等
Hello! So, wait!

1264
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:17,050
誰在演出最前面？
Who is fronting the show?

1265
01:15:17,140 --> 01:15:18,980
塔克？我不知道那是誰
Tucker? No, I don't know who that is.

1266
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:22,350
好，我可以通宵直播，但這...
Okay, well, I could go live for the overnights, but this is...

1267
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:25,690
「衛星時間」？ 不，我有準確消息
"Satellite time?" No, I have a dedicated feed.

1268
01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:28,460
什麼時候開始？
Since when?

1269
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:29,620
我是塔克·王
<i>This is Tucker Wang.</i>

1270
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:30,860
我是金姆·貝克
This is Kim Baker.

1271
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,460
我為什麼聽說我沒有衛星轉播
Why am I being told that I don't have a sat hookup?

1272
01:15:33,620 --> 01:15:35,470
因為你現在加入計時工資制了
<i>Because you're on the hourly plan now.</i>

1273
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:37,130
反正這節目今晚要播
<i>And either way, the show is full tonight.</i>

1274
01:15:37,230 --> 01:15:38,470
不，你的上級是誰
No. Who is your boss?

1275
01:15:38,530 --> 01:15:40,910
我要跟這個傑瑞什麼陶布聊聊
I want to talk to this Jerry whatever, Taub.

1276
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:43,640
好吧，聽我說，傑瑞跟我 提到過一次阿富汗
<i>Okay, look, Jerry has mentioned Afghanistan to me once,</i>

1277
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:45,540
還提到過知道為什麼一年之內
<i>and mentioned it to know why the only good story to come</i>

1278
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:47,340
報道出來的好故事 都是另一個臺的
<i>out of there in a year was on another network.</i>

1279
01:15:47,410 --> 01:15:49,720
什麼？譚雅那些？ 不，我有那樣的故事
What, Tanya's thing? No, I've got shit like that.

1280
01:15:49,810 --> 01:15:51,510
我在等冰雪融化
I'm waiting for the snow to melt!

1281
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:53,050
我要跟傑瑞談談
I want to talk to Jerry.

1282
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:54,710
如果你能給我一個
<i>If I could just get you to get me a story</i>

1283
01:15:54,810 --> 01:15:56,380
別人關心的故事
<i>that somebody would care about,</i>

1284
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,050
那就可以了，同時...
<i>it would be fine. But meanwhile...</i>

1285
01:15:58,150 --> 01:15:59,090
好吧，我直接去紐約
Okay, what if I come to New York

1286
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:01,220
衝進傑瑞的辦公室呢？ 那怎麼樣？
and I burst into Jerry's office? How about that?

1287
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:03,060
那樣會顯得我沒幹好我的工作
<i>Well, that might look like I hadn't done my job.</i>

1288
01:16:03,150 --> 01:16:05,030
完美，星期三見
Perfect. See you Wednesday.

1289
01:16:05,090 --> 01:16:06,090
混蛋
Cunt.

1290
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:11,940
金姆
Kim.

1291
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:15,010
金姆，看看這些狗
Kim, look at these dogs.

1292
01:16:16,230 --> 01:16:17,870
這要怎麼收場？
How does this end?

1293
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:19,940
估計一桶冷水吧
A bucket of cold water, I suppose.

1294
01:16:23,670 --> 01:16:24,680
不
No.

1295
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:26,240
呃
Um...

1296
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:29,680
這個要怎麼
How does this

1297
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,190
結束
end?

1298
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:37,690
我真的不知道，金姆
Uh, I don't really know, Kim.

1299
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:42,270
我們一起變老？在鄉下買幢小屋？
We grow old together? Get a cottage in the country?

1300
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:44,030
養雞？
Raise chickens?

1301
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,730
互相喂炒蛋吃？
Eat scrambled eggs off each other?

1302
01:16:45,860 --> 01:16:48,870
我們挺好的，不是嗎 我們總有喀布爾
Look, we're good, aren't we? We'll always have Kabul.

1303
01:16:48,930 --> 01:16:50,610
不，沒有，我們不是「總有」
No, we won't. We won't "always have" it

1304
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:51,910
因為我要回家了
because I have to go home.

1305
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:53,610
不，這是家
No, this is home.

1306
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:57,210
我要去紐約調整我的生活
I have to go to New York City and justify my life

1307
01:16:57,270 --> 01:16:59,280
為了一個叫傑瑞的傢伙
to somebody named Jerry

1308
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:01,720
在他奪走一切之前，然後我...
before he takes it all away, and I

1309
01:17:03,450 --> 01:17:07,790
我不能回去坐在辦公桌後面，我不能
cannot go back to sitting at a goddamn desk. I can't.

1310
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:09,960
聽我說
Aye. Listen...

1311
01:17:10,050 --> 01:17:12,300
沒人能從你身邊奪走什麼
No one can take it away from you.

1312
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:13,600
什麼都不行
Not all of it.

1313
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:15,670
不管發生什麼，你有我
Whatever happens, you'll have me.

1314
01:17:16,230 --> 01:17:19,400
這種話聽著舒服，但是...
That's a very nice thing to say, but...

1315
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:20,740
但是什麼？
But what?

1316
01:17:32,610 --> 01:17:36,420
捲入兩輛卡車相撞的致命事件
<i>Following a fatal traffic accident involving a coalition truck,</i>

1317
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,750
並經歷了長期壓抑沮喪之後
<i>long simmering frustration</i>

1318
01:17:37,850 --> 01:17:41,420
今天情緒終於爆發成暴力和絕望
<i>today boiled over into violence and despair.</i>

1319
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:42,930
他們殺死我們
<i>They kill us!</i>

1320
01:17:42,990 --> 01:17:44,990
他們殺死我們，傷我們的心
<i>They kill us and they break our hearts!</i>

1321
01:17:45,090 --> 01:17:47,660
我也要把這些話送給 哈米德·卡爾扎伊總統
<i>And I also give this message to President Hamid Karzai.</i>

1322
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:50,170
這裏到底出了什麼事
<i>What the hell is happening here?</i>

1323
01:18:11,050 --> 01:18:13,050
我不在乎那裏面是誰，我是金姆·貝克
Okay, I don't care who the hell's in there. I'm Kim Baker.

1324
01:18:13,150 --> 01:18:15,690
進去吧，金姆，傑瑞在等你
Go on in, Kim. Jerry's expecting you.

1325
01:18:15,790 --> 01:18:18,200
真是讓人不爽
Well, that's fucking unsatisfying.

1326
01:18:18,290 --> 01:18:19,630
能替你拿包嗎
Can I take your bag?

1327
01:18:19,690 --> 01:18:21,000
好，謝謝
Yes. Please.

1328
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:23,200
你需要喝點水嗎
Would you care for some water?

1329
01:18:23,290 --> 01:18:24,300
要
Yes.

1330
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:36,510
我應該谷歌一下你的
I should've Googled you.

1331
01:18:36,570 --> 01:18:40,180
我一直...一直在用各種 錯誤的罵人語言
I've been... I've been using all the wrong swear words.

1332
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:43,720
希望沒有毀掉你的重要時刻
Well, I hope I didn't ruin your big moment.

1333
01:18:43,810 --> 01:18:46,560
聽我說，蓋裏，我不知道 塔克跟你說了什麼
Look, Geri, I don't know what Tucker has been telling you.

1334
01:18:46,650 --> 01:18:49,060
他說你對自己的播出時間不滿意
He said that you're upset about the air time you're getting.

1335
01:18:49,150 --> 01:18:52,430
不是那樣的，這不是為了我
That's just wrong, because this is not about me.

1336
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:54,560
我擔心的是我們的優先方向
My frustration is with our priorities

1337
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:56,660
以及電視臺的最大利益
and what's best for the network.

1338
01:18:57,490 --> 01:19:00,000
決定對電臺最好的策略 難道不是我的工作嗎
Isn't deciding what's best for the network my job?

1339
01:19:01,830 --> 01:19:03,180
我只是說
I'm just saying,

1340
01:19:03,830 --> 01:19:06,210
作為記者，我們對這個故事有義務
as journalists, we have an obligation to this story.

1341
01:19:06,270 --> 01:19:09,840
阿富汗應該暫時多上一些新聞
And Afghanistan should be on our air more, period.

1342
01:19:09,910 --> 01:19:11,580
憑借我們在那裏的資源
With the resources we have over there,

1343
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:14,180
阿富汗絕對應該多上節目
Afghanistan should definitely be on our air more.

1344
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:18,390
但問題是，只要大家都愛士兵
But the problem is, as much as everyone loves the troops,

1345
01:19:18,450 --> 01:19:21,900
他們就不會想再在電視上 看到大兵出現
they don't actually want to watch them on the news anymore.

1346
01:19:21,950 --> 01:19:23,120
他們就是不想看
They just don't.

1347
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:26,230
所以我不能給阿富汗更多播出時間
So I can't give Afghanistan more air.

1348
01:19:26,290 --> 01:19:30,260
這意味著我需要給阿富汗 更少的資源
Which means I need to give Afghanistan fewer resources.

1349
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:32,860
那才是對檯曆最好的
That's what's best for the network.

1350
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:34,780
蓋裏
Geri...

1351
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:35,870
你有個電話
You have that call now.

1352
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:40,440
我不是想當壞人
I'm not trying to be a bitch.

1353
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:41,710
好吧，跟你說件事
Okay, let me pitch you something.

1354
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:43,050
好了，中國礦產讓步...
All right, the Chinese mining concession...

1355
01:19:43,110 --> 01:19:44,110
天啊
Jesus!

1356
01:19:44,210 --> 01:19:45,450
聽著，上一個從阿富汗
Look, the last person who got any kind of

1357
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:47,110
得到過消息的人
bounce out of Afghanistan

1358
01:19:47,210 --> 01:19:48,950
就是你的朋友譚雅·范德普爾
was your friend Tanya Vanderpoel.

1359
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:52,390
多虧了那個無人機故事 他還幫我擺脫了一個困境
She's actually got me over a barrel thanks to that drone story.

1360
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:54,230
擺脫困境是什麼意思
What do you mean, "over a barrel"?

1361
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:55,630
她在倫敦，金姆
She's London, Kim.

1362
01:19:57,390 --> 01:19:59,330
- 你要請譚雅 - 對
- You're hiring Tanya. - Yes.

1363
01:20:00,790 --> 01:20:02,600
我以為你們是一起飛過來的
I assumed you two flew here together.

1364
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:05,900
她在這
She's here.

1365
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:13,180
對不起，在UAV攻擊之前 你就跟她有聯繫了？
I'm sorry, you started talking to her before the UAV strike?

1366
01:20:13,270 --> 01:20:14,810
UAV無人機？
Is UAV a drone?

1367
01:20:16,910 --> 01:20:18,080
你好，你去哪？
Hello! Where are you going?

1368
01:20:18,410 --> 01:20:20,820
不，我只在這呆幾天
No, I'm only here for a few days.

1369
01:20:21,310 --> 01:20:22,810
我知道
Oh, I know.

1370
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:25,990
該死
Oh, fuck.

1371
01:20:26,650 --> 01:20:28,250
我不知道要跟你說什麼
I don't know what to say to you.

1372
01:20:28,350 --> 01:20:30,420
對不起，我搞砸了
Ducky, I'm sorry. I fucked up.

1373
01:20:30,490 --> 01:20:32,090
你去部落是不是
Did you go to the Tribals

1374
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,790
因為要去商量合同？
because you were in a contract negotiation?

1375
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:36,100
夥計，我不會偷走你的工作，好嗎
Dude, I'm not stealing your job, okay?

1376
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:39,000
譚雅，這跟我的工作沒關係
Tanya, this is not about my fucking job.

1377
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:41,840
我們必須打幾個有質量的電話，好嗎
We have to make good calls, right?

1378
01:20:41,930 --> 01:20:44,710
安迪失去了個眼睛，賈維德死了
And now Andy lost an eye and Jaweed is dead.

1379
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:47,440
天啊，我們都犯過錯
Christ, man, we've both fucking made mistakes!

1380
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:50,610
不，告訴我你去部落 不是為了合同
No. Tell me you didn't go to the Tribals because of a contract.

1381
01:20:51,710 --> 01:20:54,850
如果賈維德去找你，你會做 跟我完全相同的事
You would have done exactly what I did if Jaweed had gone to you.

1382
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:56,520
不，我不是你
No. I'm not you.

1383
01:21:03,050 --> 01:21:05,060
記不記得你第一次外勤？
Do you remember your first embed?

1384
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:08,460
你採訪了一個年輕的海軍陸戰隊員？
You interviewed a young Marine?

1385
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:09,530
考夫林？對
Coughlin? Yes. What?

1386
01:21:09,630 --> 01:21:13,130
他們播出你的故事後
Yeah, well, after they aired your story,

1387
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:17,370
你用了一小段他說步槍沒有上膛的話
where you used his soundbite about not loading his rifle,

1388
01:21:17,470 --> 01:21:19,380
他們把他送到赫爾曼德去了
they sent him to Helmand.

1389
01:21:20,070 --> 01:21:22,070
他在那被炸斷了腿
And he got his legs blown off.

1390
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,380
我是這麼聽說的
So I hear.

1391
01:21:30,050 --> 01:21:31,550
喀布爾見
See you in Kabul.

1392
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:04,690
她追蹤這個故事我並不感到吃驚
<i>I'm not really surprised she chased the story.</i>

1393
01:22:04,850 --> 01:22:06,560
那就是我們的工作 那就是你的工作
That's what we do. That's what you do.

1394
01:22:06,620 --> 01:22:07,690
換成我也會去
I would do it.

1395
01:22:10,690 --> 01:22:12,190
對不起
Sorry.

1396
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:15,030
該死，我累了
Goddamn it, I'm tired.

1397
01:22:15,090 --> 01:22:16,400
你訂了回程機票嗎
You booked your return yet?

1398
01:22:16,460 --> 01:22:18,270
因為如果願意你可以來格拉斯哥
'Cause you could come through Glasgow if you wanted.

1399
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:19,310
- 我會去找你 - 什麼？
<i>- I'll meet you.</i> - What?

1400
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:21,100
不，巴達克山怎麼樣？
No. What about Badakhshan?

1401
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:22,730
巴達克山，那可以等等
Badakhshan, that will keep

1402
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:25,280
因為該死的山路還被大雪封著
because the fucking pass is still snowed in.

1403
01:22:25,370 --> 01:22:28,110
我需要那個故事，我需要 一次成功，好嗎
I need that story. I need a hit, all right?

1404
01:22:28,210 --> 01:22:30,310
我需要點東西，這樣蓋裏就不會認為
I need something so that Geri doesn't decide

1405
01:22:30,410 --> 01:22:32,720
我不如她辦公室裏那個土耳其惡人有用
I'm more useful as an ottoman in her fucking office.

1406
01:22:32,780 --> 01:22:35,720
金姆，你需要的是站在局外看事情
What you need, Kim, is some time out of the bubble.

1407
01:22:35,780 --> 01:22:38,230
你最好做好準備，因為我要
<i>You'd better get ready. I'm fucking making love to you</i>

1408
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:41,230
用風笛版的薩德歌曲向你表白
to bagpipe versions of Sade songs.

1409
01:22:43,390 --> 01:22:44,630
好吧
Yeah, okay.

1410
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:46,500
真的？你會去格拉斯哥找我？
Really? You'll meet me in Glasgow?

1411
01:22:47,290 --> 01:22:49,790
好，我去格拉斯哥
Yeah, I'll meet you in Glasgow.

1412
01:22:49,890 --> 01:22:51,500
- 我搭下一班飛機 - 好
<i>- I'll get the next flight.</i> - Okay.

1413
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:53,900
- 拜拜 - 拜拜
- Bye. <i>- Bye.</i>

1414
01:23:03,570 --> 01:23:04,750
嘿，安托萬
Hey, Antoine.

1415
01:23:04,810 --> 01:23:07,690
你從哪來的？ 我還以為你在巴達克山
Where have you come from? I thought you were in Badakhshan.

1416
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:10,920
本來是，連夜飛回來的
I was. Drove back overnight.

1417
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:12,860
等等，什麼？通路打開了？
Wait, what? The pass is open?

1418
01:23:12,950 --> 01:23:14,830
對，暫時的
<i>Oui.</i> For now.

1419
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,100
乾杯
Cheers.

1420
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:52,800
天啊
Oh, Christ.

1421
01:23:55,790 --> 01:23:56,830
不好意思
Excuse me.

1422
01:23:58,660 --> 01:23:59,700
昆都士在附近嗎
Kunduz near?

1423
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:01,130
遠嗎？
Far?

1424
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,850
我想租輛車
I'd like to rent a car.

1425
01:24:10,370 --> 01:24:11,380
嗯哼
Mmm-hmm.

1426
01:24:11,710 --> 01:24:13,650
（達裏語）

1427
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:16,390
謝謝
Aye, thank you.

1428
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:18,990
我知道了，多謝
Yeah, I get it. Thank you. Thanks a lot.

1429
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:44,910
天啊
Oh, Jesus.

1430
01:24:45,510 --> 01:24:47,180
該死
Oh, shit.

1431
01:24:56,190 --> 01:24:58,530
（蘇格蘭格拉斯哥） 歡迎來到格拉斯哥國際機場
<i>Welcome to Glasgow International Airport.</i>

1432
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:02,440
目前室外溫度為16攝氏度
<i>Outside temperature's 18 degrees Celsius.</i>

1433
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:04,600
當地時間下午3點
<i>Local time is 15 hours.</i>

1434
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:07,540
將會有空乘協助您取行李
<i>There will be an airline representative to assist you to your luggage.</i>

1435
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,740
再次感謝搭乘..
<i>Once again, thank you for flying with us...</i>

1436
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:10,580
（布萊恩：伊安失蹤）

1437
01:25:11,070 --> 01:25:12,600
天啊
Oh, my God.

1438
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:14,080
（特裏：伊安被綁架）

1439
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:17,940
（Br伊安：他的大巴被埋伏）

1440
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,420
給蘇珊留言
Leaving a message for Susan.

1441
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:28,620
伍德沃德，我又會喀布爾了
Woodward, I'm back in Kabul again.

1442
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:29,960
我想查出些關於
I'm trying to get information about

1443
01:25:30,050 --> 01:25:31,290
伊安·麥克凱爾皮消失的消息
the disappearance of Iain MacKelpie,

1444
01:25:31,390 --> 01:25:33,490
所以如果路透社有人能幫忙 請回我電話
so if someone at Reuters can please call me back.

1445
01:25:33,590 --> 01:25:35,400
收到這條信息請打電話告訴我
Call to let me know that you've received this message.

1446
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:36,670
謝謝
Thank you.

1447
01:25:53,740 --> 01:25:55,950
誰會綁架一個蘇格蘭來的自由攝影師？
Who kidnaps a Scottish freelance photographer?

1448
01:25:56,010 --> 01:25:58,190
綁架都是為了錢，對吧？
The whole point of kidnapping is to get money, right?

1449
01:25:58,280 --> 01:25:59,490
在我看來
As far as I understand,

1450
01:25:59,580 --> 01:26:01,490
伊安只是錯誤的時間 出現在了錯誤的地點
Iain was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

1451
01:26:01,590 --> 01:26:04,360
這一團糟的國家現在連 綁架都幹不好了嗎
Can this half-assed country not even do kidnapping right?

1452
01:26:04,450 --> 01:26:07,460
ISAF不認為這是有高度組織的行為
ISAF does not think this was an upper-tier organization.

1453
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:10,330
所以這些人可能會想辦法 把他賣給別人
So these men will probably try to sell him to someone else.

1454
01:26:10,430 --> 01:26:13,530
然後就要找人聊聊了
And then there will be some talking, you know.

1455
01:26:13,630 --> 01:26:15,970
天啊，法希姆，他們會殺了他的
Oh, my God, Fahim. They're gonna kill him.

1456
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:18,340
不，他們不會的
No, they will not, Kim,

1457
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:19,850
聽天由命
<i>inshallah.</i>

1458
01:26:22,140 --> 01:26:25,380
現在你應該想說「我早說過了」吧
Now is when you're supposed to say "I told you so."

1459
01:26:35,150 --> 01:26:36,460
操
Fuck!

1460
01:26:44,660 --> 01:26:47,970
齋月結束了，他們在宰羊羔
Ramadan has ended. They are slaughtering lambs.

1461
01:27:07,980 --> 01:27:09,050
我能跟他聊聊嗎
May I speak with him?

1462
01:27:09,150 --> 01:27:10,150
將軍很忙
The general's busy.

1463
01:27:14,090 --> 01:27:16,090
不是吧？將軍？橢圓機？
Really, General? The elliptical?

1464
01:27:16,660 --> 01:27:18,440
我膝蓋不好
I have bad knees.

1465
01:27:20,830 --> 01:27:23,870
你應該不是來這聞汗味的吧
I'm guessing you didn't come here for the smell of balls.

1466
01:27:23,930 --> 01:27:25,910
所有人都出去
Everybody get the fuck out!

1467
01:27:31,510 --> 01:27:33,350
他們相信他可能被賣給
They believe that he may have been sold

1468
01:27:33,410 --> 01:27:34,950
同一區域的
to another organization

1469
01:27:35,050 --> 01:27:36,890
另一個組織了
somewhere in that same region.

1470
01:27:41,020 --> 01:27:43,220
這個忙有點大，貝克
That's a pretty big ask, Baker.

1471
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:47,030
時間緊迫
There's a real-time clock on this.

1472
01:27:48,590 --> 01:27:50,540
對不起，我幫不了你
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

1473
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:01,380
你知道，真可惜
You know, it's just a shame that

1474
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:03,280
你幹了這麼多高調的事
y'all don't get credit for all these

1475
01:28:03,370 --> 01:28:05,110
卻沒有把功名都攬下來
high-profile things that you do.

1476
01:28:05,210 --> 01:28:07,710
特別是外面還有三角洲 和海豹突擊隊
You know, especially with SEALs and Delta out there.

1477
01:28:07,780 --> 01:28:09,050
一星期之後你就沒法
I mean, what week goes by that you don't see

1478
01:28:09,110 --> 01:28:11,460
在電視上看到那些傢伙了，對嗎
those assholes on TV, am I right?

1479
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:16,320
然後下一次國會就五角大樓預算投票
And then next time Congress votes on a Pentagon budget

1480
01:28:16,420 --> 01:28:20,090
海軍陸戰隊預算又會被小小的 削減10%
and there's this pesky little 10% line item for the Marines,

1481
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:23,230
接下來你們就只能被併入海軍了
next thing you know, you guys are just part of the Navy.

1482
01:28:23,290 --> 01:28:25,000
不過，長官，你穿著漂亮的白色軍裝
Although, sir, you would look spectacular

1483
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:26,940
看上去非常帥氣
in one of those pretty white uniforms.

1484
01:28:31,770 --> 01:28:33,110
天啊，你知道嗎
God, you know what?

1485
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:36,650
只是在我看來，和JSOC不同
It's just occurring to me that, unlike JSOC,

1486
01:28:36,740 --> 01:28:38,950
你們允許記者隨軍
you guys allow reporter embeds.

1487
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:42,920
這意味著攝影師能參加戰鬥任務
Which means that a cameraman could go on a FORECON mission.

1488
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:46,620
你不認為這對軍隊很好嗎，長官
Don't you think that would be great for the Corps, sir?

1489
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:48,930
那種曝光？
That kind of exposure?

1490
01:28:50,450 --> 01:28:51,960
對你也挺好的
Pretty good for you, too.

1491
01:28:53,590 --> 01:28:55,190
聽著，我們不會盲目出擊
Look, we don't go in blind.

1492
01:28:55,290 --> 01:28:57,700
我們必須知道自己在幹什麼 要到什麼地方去
We have to know what we're doing and where we're going.

1493
01:28:57,790 --> 01:28:59,210
這是我們辦事的方式
It's the way we work.

1494
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:01,970
我們不太可能得到地址，但是...
We're not likely to get an address, but...

1495
01:29:02,030 --> 01:29:03,510
當你有確鑿的證據
When you have something concrete,

1496
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:04,980
再回來，我們會馬上行動
come back and we'll get kinetic.

1497
01:29:10,940 --> 01:29:12,510
噢
Ugh!

1498
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:19,520
請告訴薩迪克先生他的 「特別朋友」來了
Please tell Mr. Sadiq that his "special friend" is here.

1499
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:21,990
我能為你做點什麼？泡茶？ 新的PS遊戲機？
What can I get for you? Some tea? The new PlayStation?

1500
01:29:22,050 --> 01:29:23,690
不，謝謝，我只需要一些你的時間
No, thank you. I just need a moment of your time.

1501
01:29:23,790 --> 01:29:24,960
啊
Ah.

1502
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:29,130
我們還是朋友嗎，薩迪克
We still friends, Sadiq?

1503
01:29:29,190 --> 01:29:32,300
那取決於你，金姆
Well, that is up to you, Kim.

1504
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:34,210
因為你曾經告訴我
Because you once told me

1505
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:37,040
這裏發生的事你全都知道
that nothing happens here that you don't know about.

1506
01:29:37,130 --> 01:29:39,200
那你一定知道我的朋友
So you must know about my friend.

1507
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:41,340
伊安·麥克凱爾皮被綁架
Iain MacKelpie getting kidnapped.

1508
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:42,470
我聽說過，對
I did hear about this, yes.

1509
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:43,750
人人都聽說過
Yeah, well, everybody heard about it,

1510
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:48,310
但你這樣位高權重的人 肯定真正知道什麼
but a powerful man such as yourself must actually know something.

1511
01:29:48,380 --> 01:29:50,520
或者你的朋友巴夏·汗 會知道什麼
Or your friend Pacha Khan knows something.

1512
01:29:50,580 --> 01:29:51,890
或者他的朋友
Or his friend does.

1513
01:29:51,980 --> 01:29:53,150
當然
Of course.

1514
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:56,220
我能打聽一下，但只能為了
I could make some inquiries, but I can only do this

1515
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:58,490
非常特別的朋友去做
for a very special friend.

1516
01:30:17,170 --> 01:30:20,020
我有段視頻你應該看看，薩迪克
I have a video that I think you should watch, Sadiq.

1517
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:22,580
按那小三角就行
You push the little triangle.

1518
01:30:23,750 --> 01:30:26,090
你能在手機上看視頻？
You can watch video on the phone?

1519
01:30:29,850 --> 01:30:31,030
這是什麼？
What is this?

1520
01:30:32,590 --> 01:30:34,540
看上去是阿富汗
It looks like the Attorney General

1521
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:36,540
伊斯蘭共和國的司法部長
of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan

1522
01:30:36,590 --> 01:30:37,900
在街頭
dancing in the street

1523
01:30:38,030 --> 01:30:40,370
和伊斯蘭的西方敵人
with a Western enemy of Islam

1524
01:30:40,430 --> 01:30:42,380
在有酒的派對上跳舞
at a party where alcohol was served.

1525
01:30:43,430 --> 01:30:44,940
我這輩子都沒碰過酒
I've never touched alcohol in my life!

1526
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,950
我只是說這看上去給人的印象
Well, I'm just saying how it looks.

1527
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:56,890
這是個好主意，對吧？
It's a good idea, right?

1528
01:30:57,880 --> 01:30:59,720
這是個絕妙的主意
It's a great idea!

1529
01:31:00,550 --> 01:31:01,650
簡直無敵
It's fucking ace!

1530
01:31:04,390 --> 01:31:05,890
幹得好，金姆
Good on ya, Kim!

1531
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:11,000
我們走，上飛機，走
Let's go, load up! Let's go, move, move, move!

1532
01:31:24,140 --> 01:31:26,810
你喝田納西威士忌嗎，貝克小姐
You drink Tennessee whiskey, Miss Baker?

1533
01:31:27,980 --> 01:31:28,980
喝
Yeah.

1534
01:31:31,610 --> 01:31:33,120
太棒了
Outstanding.

1535
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:21,890
Br伊安？怎麼回事？
Tall Brian? What the fuck?

1536
01:33:35,210 --> 01:33:37,210
坐好了，先生，我去幫你叫車
Hang tight, sir. I'm gonna get you that ride.

1537
01:33:37,270 --> 01:33:38,750
謝謝
Thank you.

1538
01:33:43,110 --> 01:33:45,620
軍隊怎麼了，布萊登醫生
What happened to the army, Dr. Brydon?

1539
01:33:48,550 --> 01:33:50,050
我就是軍隊
I am the army.

1540
01:33:55,230 --> 01:33:56,900
謝謝，金姆
Thank you, Kim.

1541
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:58,230
你好嗎
How are you?

1542
01:33:58,660 --> 01:33:59,830
我經歷過更慘的綁架
I've had worse kidnappings.

1543
01:34:03,730 --> 01:34:04,800
麥克凱爾皮只受了些輕傷
<i>MacKelpie is being treated for minor injuries.</i>

1544
01:34:06,270 --> 01:34:07,980
但這些難以置信的視頻
<i>Again, this incredible footage</i>

1545
01:34:08,070 --> 01:34:09,950
是由我臺記者金姆·貝克拍攝
<i>was produced by our very own Kim Baker.</i>

1546
01:34:10,010 --> 01:34:12,320
太了不起了，真厲害，金姆
<i>Just incredible. Way to go, Kim!</i>

1547
01:34:13,410 --> 01:34:17,020
要是你想綁架一個人兩次
If you want to kidnap someone fucking twice,

1548
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:18,110
就得開豐田車
you do a Toyota.

1549
01:34:18,180 --> 01:34:21,860
完全沒有他們把你從 長袍裏拖出來那麼有趣
Fucking not as interesting as it got when they fucking pulled out a burqa.

1550
01:34:21,950 --> 01:34:23,520
這對我來說太久了
It's too fucking long for me!

1551
01:34:23,620 --> 01:34:25,190
我都不知道那是哪個女人的
I don't know who the woman was it belonged to.

1552
01:34:25,290 --> 01:34:26,860
我又不是才6英尺2英吋高
I'm not fucking 6'2", right?

1553
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:29,940
我一直拖著這該死的東西 唯一值得安慰的就是
I'm dragging this fucking thing along, thinking the only consolation is,

1554
01:34:29,990 --> 01:34:32,130
至少我不是該死的女人
at least if I'm a fucking woman,

1555
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:34,940
我不會被強姦，懂我的意思嗎
I'm not gonna get buggered, you know what I'm saying?

1556
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:43,780
總之，我看著就有點那樣
So anyway, I took a little something, actually.

1557
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:45,340
我還去了塔利班的禮品店
I went to the gift shop at Taliban.

1558
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:46,680
恐怕我只買到了
I'm afraid all I could get

1559
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:48,350
那些
was that.

1560
01:35:12,470 --> 01:35:14,970
- 真可惜你要走了 - 嗯
- It's a shame you're going. - Hmm?

1561
01:35:15,140 --> 01:35:19,250
希望他們至少讓你坐頭等艙
Well, I hope at least they're flying you first class.

1562
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:22,050
蓋裏沒那麼喜歡我 但現在她喜歡我了
Geri doesn't like me that much. But she does like me now,

1563
01:35:22,150 --> 01:35:24,350
所以，趁我現在還受寵
so while I have this juice,

1564
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:26,190
我得讓生活變得更好
I've got to leverage it into something better.

1565
01:35:26,250 --> 01:35:27,520
對
Yes!

1566
01:35:27,580 --> 01:35:28,890
對，等等，伊拉克
Yes, wait, Iraq.

1567
01:35:28,990 --> 01:35:30,590
我跟你一起去
I'll come with you.

1568
01:35:30,690 --> 01:35:33,500
不，是巴基斯坦吧 那裏到處都是槍聲
No, actually, Pakistan. That's where the real shooting shit is.

1569
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:34,830
簡直就跟狂野西部一樣
It's like the Wild West out there.

1570
01:35:34,890 --> 01:35:37,770
實際上，我跟蓋裏說我想去紐約 或者華盛頓
Actually, I told Geri that I want New York or D.C.

1571
01:35:43,030 --> 01:35:44,270
我真的說了
No, I did.

1572
01:35:45,570 --> 01:35:46,950
不，你要去哪？
No, really, where are you going?

1573
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:48,450
紐約或者華盛頓
New York or D.C.

1574
01:35:50,540 --> 01:35:51,680
為什麼？
Why?

1575
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:55,020
你還是可以跟我一起走
You can still come with me.

1576
01:36:01,550 --> 01:36:03,460
因為我覺得在現實世界
Because I think there's plenty of good work

1577
01:36:03,550 --> 01:36:05,030
還有很多事可以做
to be done in the real world,

1578
01:36:05,090 --> 01:36:07,130
而喀布爾現在還不錯
and the Kabubble is well-established.

1579
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:09,860
這是為了報復我不帶你 一個人去巴達克山嗎
Is this about me going to Badakhshan without you?

1580
01:36:09,930 --> 01:36:12,460
因為如果是你也會做同樣的事
'Cause you would have done exactly the same thing.

1581
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:14,770
嘿，我原諒你
And, hey, what, I forgive you!

1582
01:36:17,530 --> 01:36:19,210
這不是因為你
This is not about you.

1583
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:21,940
也不是為了巴達克山或者格拉斯哥
It's not about Badakhshan, or Glasgow,

1584
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:23,950
或者養雞的小屋
or the cottage with the chickens.

1585
01:36:25,070 --> 01:36:26,210
什麼雞
What chickens?

1586
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:35,130
沒事，我知道你不會來
It's okay. I know you're not gonna come.

1587
01:36:39,490 --> 01:36:41,400
我只是得在一切太遲之前離開這
I just have to get out of here before it's too late.

1588
01:36:42,990 --> 01:36:44,340
什麼意思？
What do you mean?

1589
01:36:46,430 --> 01:36:48,600
我開始覺得這都是正常的
I started to feel like this was normal.

1590
01:36:51,670 --> 01:36:53,510
你知道這不正常，對吧？
You know it's not, right?

1591
01:37:10,820 --> 01:37:12,490
來紐約你就明白
Come to New York and get it.

1592
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:16,600
記住，現在曼哈頓是6點
Remember, you're like a six in Manhattan.

1593
01:37:49,690 --> 01:37:51,190
你的孩子怎麼樣？
How's your baby?

1594
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:53,200
哪個？
Which one?

1595
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:55,710
- 你有兩個？ - 對啊
- You have two? - Yes.

1596
01:37:57,800 --> 01:37:59,710
愛爾蘭雙胞胎
Irish twins.

1597
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:04,310
他們都很好
No, they are very good.

1598
01:38:04,370 --> 01:38:07,150
小的是男孩，非常有力氣
The younger one, the boy, he's very strong.

1599
01:38:07,310 --> 01:38:08,520
- 嗯 - 嗯
- Mmm. - Mmm.

1600
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:10,880
女孩肯定也很有力氣
I bet the girl is strong, too.

1601
01:38:10,980 --> 01:38:12,320
她力氣更大
She's stronger.

1602
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:43,350
那麼
So, um,

1603
01:38:44,910 --> 01:38:47,360
醫院那些人，那些成癮患者...
those men in the hospital, the addicts...

1604
01:38:49,050 --> 01:38:51,090
他們中有人好起來了嗎？
Any of them ever get better?

1605
01:38:51,190 --> 01:38:53,860
有人得到幸福的結局嗎？
Have a happy ending?

1606
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:08,440
在我的文化中，我們會擁抱
In my culture, we would hug.

1607
01:40:33,290 --> 01:40:34,360
嘿
Hey.

1608
01:40:35,630 --> 01:40:37,470
你知道，我懷念阿富汗
<i>You know, I miss it. The Stan.</i>

1609
01:40:38,030 --> 01:40:39,470
我也懷念
Yeah, I miss it, too.

1610
01:40:39,530 --> 01:40:41,630
實際上我還試過回去
Actually, I tried to go back

1611
01:40:42,630 --> 01:40:44,310
但連軍隊都不肯帶我去
but even the Army wouldn't take me.

1612
01:40:44,970 --> 01:40:48,010
軍隊啊，太傷人了
I mean, the Army! I mean, that's just hurtful.

1613
01:40:51,210 --> 01:40:54,050
你發生的事我很抱歉
Well, I'm very sorry for what happened to you.

1614
01:40:54,140 --> 01:40:56,990
如果有什麼你想對我說的
So if there's anything that you want to say to me,

1615
01:40:57,050 --> 01:40:58,050
我就是為此而來
that's why I'm here.

1616
01:40:58,380 --> 01:41:00,050
我就為這來的
That's why I came here.

1617
01:41:00,420 --> 01:41:01,490
女士
Ma'am,

1618
01:41:03,250 --> 01:41:06,830
我是因為路邊炸彈失去的雙腿 不是因為你
I lost my legs because of an IED, not because of you.

1619
01:41:09,060 --> 01:41:11,230
謝謝你這麼說，但如果不是 我引用你的話
I appreciate that, but if I hadn't quoted you,

1620
01:41:11,330 --> 01:41:13,670
你也不會被調走
you wouldn't have been transferred.

1621
01:41:13,830 --> 01:41:15,540
不，真的，你想對我說什麼都行
No, really, you can say whatever you want to me.

1622
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:16,670
我就是為這來的
That's why I'm here.

1623
01:41:16,730 --> 01:41:18,040
好吧，那這麼說吧，你是對的
Okay, well, then let's say you're right.

1624
01:41:18,100 --> 01:41:19,200
這依然不是因為你，女士
It's still not 'cause of you, ma'am.

1625
01:41:19,670 --> 01:41:23,850
一個12歲的教徒安裝了那個炸彈
Some 12-year-old haji had to plant that bomb.

1626
01:41:23,910 --> 01:41:26,720
你知道，如果本拉登的父母
And, hell, you know, if Bin Laden's parents

1627
01:41:26,780 --> 01:41:28,080
沒有結婚
hadn't have gotten divorced,

1628
01:41:28,180 --> 01:41:31,090
也許我們所有人一開始就不會去那
maybe none of us would've been in the Stan to begin with.

1629
01:41:33,020 --> 01:41:36,550
然後塔利班，他們也不會 在那跟UBL打
And the Taliban, they wouldn't have even been there for UBL

1630
01:41:36,620 --> 01:41:39,260
要是總統和五角大樓一開始
if Brezhnev hadn't have gone and fouled up Afghanistan

1631
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:40,860
就沒在阿富汗搗亂
in the first place.

1632
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:45,360
當然還有大英帝國
And the British Empire. Yeah.

1633
01:41:45,430 --> 01:41:46,600
還有金姆·貝克
And Kim Baker.

1634
01:41:46,700 --> 01:41:48,140
好吧，我是活該
Okay, I deserve that.

1635
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:51,740
見鬼，你的腿一沒了
Goddamn! Once you got no legs,

1636
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:53,640
人人都那麼嚴肅
everyone takes everything so serious.

1637
01:41:54,970 --> 01:41:58,780
我們中只有很少的人能稍稍掌控
I mean, there's only so much any of us have any control of,

1638
01:41:59,540 --> 01:42:02,110
好或者壞
good or bad.

1639
01:42:02,210 --> 01:42:05,390
如果你在阿富汗沒學到那些 你就是沒認真
If you didn't learn that in Afghanistan, you were not paying attention.

1640
01:42:05,450 --> 01:42:07,660
所以你不會衝我大吼大叫？
So, you're not gonna yell at me?

1641
01:42:07,750 --> 01:42:10,090
我是說，女士
I mean, ma'am...

1642
01:42:11,890 --> 01:42:13,630
金姆，你得走出過去
Kim, you've got to move on.

1643
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:17,230
你給自己攬的負擔太多了
You're giving yourself way too much credit.

1644
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:19,910
你擁抱壞事
You embrace the suck,

1645
01:42:21,060 --> 01:42:23,070
你得往前走
you move the fuck forward.

1646
01:42:29,140 --> 01:42:31,410
我們還有什麼選擇？
What other fucking choice do we have?

1647
01:42:35,240 --> 01:42:36,590
我是不是聽到髒話了？
Do I hear swearing over there?

1648
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:39,980
為什麼每次我罵人你都會站在邊上
How are you standing there the one time I curse?

1649
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:41,120
- 就一次 - 我是說
- "One time." - I mean...

1650
01:42:41,180 --> 01:42:42,320
真的，他在軍隊
It's true. He had a good

1651
01:42:42,420 --> 01:42:43,420
一直表現都很好
long run in the military.

1652
01:42:43,490 --> 01:42:45,120
別提他打掩護
Don't cover up for him.

1653
01:42:45,820 --> 01:42:46,990
那麼金姆，你留下吃晚飯嗎
So, Kim, are you gonna stay for dinner?

1654
01:42:47,090 --> 01:42:48,830
當然了
Of course she will.

1655
01:43:09,780 --> 01:43:10,950
再見
Bye!

1656
01:43:11,850 --> 01:43:15,020
- 和金姆拜拜，拜拜 - 說拜拜
- Say bye to Kim. Bye, Kim! - Say bye.

1657
01:43:35,140 --> 01:43:37,640
上校，阿富汗國民軍有錯過了
<i>Colonel, the Afghan National Army missed</i>

1658
01:43:37,710 --> 01:43:39,210
一個準備的時間節點
<i>yet another benchmark for preparedness.</i>

1659
01:43:39,310 --> 01:43:42,310
你認為這對我們從該區域撤軍 會產生什麼樣的影響？
<i>How do you think that will affect our draw down in the region?</i>

1660
01:43:42,380 --> 01:43:44,720
我們需要重新審視之前的撤軍策略
<i>There needs to be a revision to the previously announced draw down</i>

1661
01:43:44,810 --> 01:43:46,850
或者未來的生存戰略
<i>or our future exit strategy.</i>

1662
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:47,920
謝謝，羅伯茨上校
<i>Thank you, Colonel Roberts.</i>

1663
01:43:48,050 --> 01:43:49,050
謝謝，非常榮幸
<i>Thank you. My pleasure.</i>

1664
01:43:49,150 --> 01:43:51,600
接下來，看看發生在
<i>Coming up, a look at the war on terror</i>

1665
01:43:51,690 --> 01:43:54,330
我們家園附近的反恐戰爭 以及那些參戰的人們
<i>that's close to home for those of us who cover it.</i>

1666
01:43:54,390 --> 01:43:56,340
獲獎戰地攝影師伊安·麥克凱爾皮
<i>From London, I'll be joined by award-winning</i>

1667
01:43:56,390 --> 01:43:58,370
將從倫敦與我們連線
<i>combat photographer, Iain MacKelpie.</i>

1668
01:43:58,430 --> 01:44:00,240
他的新書《衝突區》
<i>His new book,</i> Conflict Zone,

1669
01:44:00,330 --> 01:44:02,280
記述了他在中東以及阿富汗
<i>chronicles a decade spent working</i>

1670
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:04,240
10年的工作見聞
<i>in the Middle East and Afghanistan.</i>

1671
01:44:04,330 --> 01:44:06,070
馬上回來
<i>That's when we return.</i>

1672
01:44:06,170 --> 01:44:08,740
好的，40秒後回歸
<i>And we're clear. Back in 40.</i>

1673
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:09,840
嗨，伊安
<i>Hi, Iain.</i>

1674
01:44:09,910 --> 01:44:11,910
嗨，你介紹我的時候
<i>Hi. Was I supposed to say something then</i>

1675
01:44:12,010 --> 01:44:13,250
- 我要不要說點什麼 - 不
<i>- when you introduced me? - Nope.</i>

1676
01:44:13,340 --> 01:44:16,520
不用，坐直了微笑就行
<i>Nope. Just sit up, smile.</i>

1677
01:44:17,950 --> 01:44:19,720
我不能笑，笑起來臉上太奇怪了
<i>I can't smile. My face feels weird.</i>

1678
01:44:19,850 --> 01:44:21,920
不，沒事的，看著不錯
<i>No, you're fine. You look good.</i>

1679
01:44:22,020 --> 01:44:23,430
謝謝你上節目
<i>Thank you for coming on the show.</i>

1680
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:24,860
不，拜託，謝謝你邀請我
<i>No, please. Thanks for having me.</i>

1681
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:26,920
好了，知道
<i>I got it. Okay, yeah. Got it.</i>

1682
01:44:27,860 --> 01:44:29,860
你知道，他們現在給我 安排了個旅行簽售
<i>You know, they got me on this book tour at the moment.</i>

1683
01:44:29,930 --> 01:44:31,300
我月底會去紐約
<i>I'm gonna be in New York at the end of the month,</i>

1684
01:44:31,390 --> 01:44:33,030
要不要一起喝杯咖啡
<i>if you'd fancy a coffee.</i>

1685
