00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,878
That was a bomb.

3
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,112
No word as to whether it was
an IED or a specific car bomb.

4
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,356
Over 10 fatalities reported.

5
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,468
Sources within ISAF suggest
that ISI may be involved.

6
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,109
Did these phones just go down or did
that fucker hang up on me?

7
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,597
Good thing that X was bodgy
or I'd be flying right now!

8
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,558
I can't hear you, honey.

9
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,273
I need to talk to Ed Faber.

10
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,436
Well, then who is fronting the show?

11
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,873
I can't hear you!

12
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,518
Hey, that's my ass!

13
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,016
Do you have a mother?

14
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,758
Don't put your ass on my hand!

15
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,115
Shut up, donkey pussy!

16
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,838
Whore! Dog-washer!

17
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,273
My cock in your ear!

18
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,656
My cock in your ear!
I shit on your lips!

19
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,272
Eat a fart!

20
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,509

<i>Listen up. Iraq Two is happening.</i>

23
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,838
The network is stretched thin.
All our talent is going there.

24
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,230
We need people, any people,
to fill the void in Afghanistan.

25
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,352
And you folks here are all the unmarried,

26
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,396
childless personnel in this bureau.

27
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,599
For those of you who are
behind the scenes, there are

28
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,797
opportunities to be on camera.

29
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,912
Kim, are you going to be joining in?

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,150
The travel or the crying?

31
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,588
Um, hopefully, the travel.

32
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,312
I'll think about it.

33
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,391
<i>The success
of Operation Mongoose</i>

34
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,153
<i>has overshadowed
the real lesson to be learned,</i>

35
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,391
<i>that the Taliban are far from vanquished.</i>

36
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,589
<i>And as the drums of war</i>

37
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,272

00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,751
I got you! Hey.

43
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,434
Uh, when do you get back from Houston?

44
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,750
<i>I think on Tuesday. Why?</i>

45
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,953
Uh, because I'm going

<i>You're going

Yeah.

00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,793
<i>Wait. For how long?</i>

50
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,758
- Like, three months.
<i>- What?</i>

51
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,749
Kim!

52
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,555
Hey!

53
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,360
I can't believe this worked out!

54
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,879
Hey, you want to have a quickie

55
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,480
on the changing table in the bathroom?

56
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,278
Yeah, I don't think I could get it up

57
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,840
with that little koala looking at me.

58
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,032
Also, they're boarding already.

59
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,678
Hey, don't worry. Just go. Go, go, go.

60
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,070
Oh, shoot,
I... I copied a key for you, so...

61
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,309
Plants, mail.

62
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,440
- Anything else I'm forgetting?
- I think that's it.

63
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,080
This is crazy.

64
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,917
Listen, I think it's impressive.

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,296
Starting a new career?

66
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,719
It's gonna be great.

67
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,360
And listen, in three months...

68
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,856
"I'll be back."

69
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,154
No, that's terrible! No.

70
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,231
Don't remember me like that. No.

71
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,431
Bye. Okay. Okay.

72
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,276
It's not my job. I'm a producer.
General news. Enron.

73
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,839
These coalminers in Pennsylvania,

74
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,353
but you probably didn't see that.

75
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,078
'Cause we got two wars going on now,

76
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,549
so, uh, I know how to set up a BGAN

77
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,312
and no one will sue if I die

78
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,234
so I got an expedited visa,
like, two days ago,

79
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,153
and I guess now I'm a war reporter.

80
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,957
Shit dick!

81
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,679
Corkscrew landing.

82

<i>Once again,

Sorry.

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,228
Uh, sorry.

88
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,915
Shit.

89
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,275
No, thank you. No, thank you.

90
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,349

91
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,519
I am Fahim.

92

Oh, Fahim, hi! Pleased to meet you.

93
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,280
The car is over here and we go.

94
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,749
Cover your head, shameless whore!

95
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,839
She says, uh...
"Welcome to Afghanistan."

96
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,748
Okay, let's go.

97
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,037
Here is your local mobile.
The number is on the back.

98
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,976
Yeah, I ordered some money last week.
Still in the post.

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,672
- I'll fix you up next week.
- Okay.

100
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,594
Yes, the air here
takes some getting used to.

101
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,557
It's quite polluted with feces.

102
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,790
Ah, here she is! How are you, Kim?

103
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,751
Welcome to the Stan. My name's Nic.

104
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,296
I'll be doing your security.
I'll take your bag.

105
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,959
Fahim. The police are giving
me shit for parking here.

106
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,271
They just want money.

107
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,433
Wait, oh, no. Um, do you need money?
Because the network gave me money.

108
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,801
- No, keep that on you!
- No, no, no! Kim, please!

109
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,996
Piss off, that's it! That's it! Hey! Hey!

110
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,070
- I'm sorry. Sorry.
- Piss off!

111
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,190
Remember that we are at altitude here,

112
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,555
so drink plenty of water
while you acclimatize.

113
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,358
Where did you learn English?

114
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,795
At medical school. I was a doctor.

115
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,077
Listen, rest up tonight.

116
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,628
Tomorrow, I'll drive you
to the base for your embed.

117
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,675
And just one bag,

118
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,796
but make sure you pack
extra socks and knickers.

119
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,913
That's like, um, it's like "panties," yeah?

120
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,588
Mmm-hmm.

121
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,230
So, you've been embedded before, then?

122
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,670
Not really. We all did
hostile-zone training in 2001.

123
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,832
They taught us to
open our mouths if we get mortared...

124
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,878
That kind of stuff.

125
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,879
Okay.

126
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,874
G'day, Qadar.

127
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,994
The feces smell
all the way to here.

128
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,751
Your room, Kim, is upstairs.

129
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,840
Yeah, they're bloody addicted.

130
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,115
That one melted a laptop
downloading porno.

131
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,918
Jaweed, yes,

132
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,235
he likes to watch men with donkeys.

133
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,833
- Hi.
- Hi.

134
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,757
It's unfortunate.

135
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,030
Kim, this is Tall Brian.

136
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,269
Brian Hooper. Tall Brian.

137
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,395
- Hi.
- I'm your shooter.

138
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,359
So, is there another Brian around here
somewhere that you're taller than?

139
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,992
Short Brian. Works for Reuters.

140
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,555
Couldn't one of you just be "Brian"?

141
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,669
Fair enough. Didn't think of that.

142
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,318
Also Short Brian's dead.

143
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,189
- Oh, fuck. Really?
- Yes.

144
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,953
Anyway, welcome to the Fun House.

145
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,919
Home sweet home.

146
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,599
This is your room.

147
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,519
Is there a shower?

148
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,576
<i>A nation accustomed to war</i>

149
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,478
<i>once again seeks a return to normality.</i>

150
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,789
<i>And nothing symbolizes that
effort more than this place,</i>

151
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,198
<i>the Kabul Zoo.</i>

152
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,077
No, he didn't. The zoo?

153
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,479
Go back to Wapping.

154
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,879
You fucking tourist!

155
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,910
Uh, shit. Sorry.
I'm trying to find the shower?

156
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,319
You're the new girl.

157
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,593
Oh, my God. Uh... Kim Baker.

158
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,432
Just got here from New York.

159
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,198
I'm Tanya. Oh, my God,

160
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,635
it's so nice to have another
woman in the house!

161
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,995
I love that lippy color. What is that?

162
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,360
No, they're just really chapped.

163
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,512
Oh, you poor thing.
Can I get you anything?

164
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,593
I'm sorry, I'm freaking out
because I saw your

165
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,990
special about your embed in
Korengal, and it was amazing.

166
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,350
Thank you. That's so sweet.

167
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,829
- Where's the shower?
- Yes. This way.

168
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,476
Can I ask a favor, Kim?

169
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,875
- And absolutely feel free to say no.
- Yeah, sure.

170
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,154
I hate to even bring it up.

171
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,595
- I feel so rude even asking this.
- No, it's fine.

172
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,234
Can I fuck your security guys?

173
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,351
What? Oh.

174
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,952
By all means, yeah.

175
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,136
Yeah? I mean, I wouldn't ask,

176
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,037
it's just that for some reason,

177
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,270
the VBC use an American contractor

178
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,316
and, I mean, no offense,
but they're all, like,

179
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,237
goatees and "fat-strong."

180
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,669
You know? But the Aussies
and Kiwis are so hot.

181
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,716
Right. I get it. Be my guest.

182
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,520
You sure? Don't just say that to be polite.

183
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,788
No, I wouldn't. I'm not.

184
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,110
Even Nic? You don't want
Nic for yourself?

185
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,713
Nic?

186
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,360
No. I don't. No.

187
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,710
That's... No, that would never happen.
So you're good.

188
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,554
Hey! No, Kim, don't say that.
You could have Nic.

189
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,757
In Afghanistan,
you're a serious piece of ass.

190
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,398
Thank you. That's nice.

191
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,056
Because you're what, I mean, you're like,

192
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,992
a seven, a six or seven in New York?

193
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,754
Here, you're a nine.

194
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,876
Borderline ten.

195
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,552
It's called "Kabul Cute."

196
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,231
What are you here, like a 15?

197
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,035
Yeah.

198
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,040
Huh.

199
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,348
The thing is, I have a very
serious boyfriend at home,

200
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,998
so, you're good.

201
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,456
All right, well, come talk
to me in two months

202
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,153
when your pussy's eating your leg.
Shower's that way.

203
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,359
How you doing?

204
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,954
It's bananas here. It's, um...

205
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,754
My nose is running.
There's shit in the air,

206
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,193
literally.

207
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,429
And.

208
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,076
I don't think I can do this.

209
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,633
<i>Do what?</i>

210
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,120
<i>Kim?</i>

211
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,958
I don't think I can do this.

212
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,031
<i>Can you see... I don't... Hello?</i>

213
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,235
Shit.

214
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,313
I'm sorry, Colonel,
I can't accept gifts as a journalist.

215
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,594
Okay.

216
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,318
So lodging, transport,

217
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,914
chow and protection,
that's all you can accept?

218
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,672
I'll do my best to stay objective.

219
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,797
I don't care if you can do your job.
I care if my men can.

220
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,117
Are you familiar with the term
"four-ten-four", Miss Baker?

221
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,593
I am not, Colonel.

222
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,513
It refers to women
who are fours back home

223
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,477
become tens when they ship out

224
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,438
and when they're back stateside,
they become fours again.

225
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,994
Are you saying I'm a four?

226
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,830
I'm saying you carry
an orange fucking backpack.

227
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,754
I've seen people with actual experience
make bad decisions here.

228
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,479
So while you're outside
the wire with my men,

229
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,915
you will in no way
distract them, understood?

230
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,350
Are you asking me not
to sleep with your soldiers?

231
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,635
No, not "soldiers." Marines.

232
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,920
You're not here to sleep with

233
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,197
or perform jobs of any type
on my Marines.

234
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,713
Clear copy, Miss Baker?

235
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,278
- Copy that.
- Good.

236
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,433
We'll get you out to a FOB
as soon as we find a ride for you.

237
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,033
In the meantime, Captain Stern here

238
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,760
will see to it that you get a wet hootch.

239
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,640
A what?

240
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,633
It's a tent with a shower.

241
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,036
Unless you'd prefer a dry hootch.

242
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,599
I would not, sir.

243
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,998
Sorry.

244
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,354
Could you just...
State your name and rank?

245
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,751
Gunnery Sergeant Clinton J. Hurd.

246
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,400
All right. Uh... Dang it!

247
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,832
So, do you believe the Afghani people
are happy about our presence here?

248
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,832
No, Afghans are the people.

249
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,151
Afghanis is the currency.

250
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,032
That's right. I knew that. Thank you.

251
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,190
What do you believe
your mission to be here?

252
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,656
Ma'am, you got a sticker on your pants.

253
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,750
It's bugging the shit out of me. Ma'am...

254
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,839
Fahim.

255
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,751
What inspired you to enlist originally?

256
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,595
I'm a big fan of the movie <i>Predator</i>
with Arnold Schwarzenegger.

257
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,079
We're the same height.

258
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,196
Do you think the war in Iraq
has affected your resources here?

259
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,033
I'm sorry, ma'am, I'm not authorized
to answer that question.

260
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,916
I'd say we're both
on the wrong side of Persia, ma'am.

261
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,416
Iraq is where you get some right now.

262
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,634
Here just has shit all.

263
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,314
Are you guys getting
outside the wire much?

264
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,476
Yes, ma'am. Most days. Uh...

265
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,154
You know, we help out with
community projects and all.

266
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,435
And wells. Uh...

267
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,918
And sometimes at night
we shoot the big gun,

268
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,036
- but, you know, it's quiet here.
- Jesus!

269
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,549
We don't wear IBAs on the FOB.

270
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,552
I don't even chamber a round
in my weapon anymore, because,

271
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,315
you know, I figure accidental discharge
is scarier than the Taliban.

272
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,915
With Iraq, do you feel like people have
forgotten about Afghanistan?

273
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,638
Oh, well...

274
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,558
Yes, ma'am. I'd say that
surely is the word for it.

275
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,230
This here's a forgotten war.

276
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,914
It's capital F, capital W.

277
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,753
What's your, uh... Your name and rank?

278
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,235
I'm Lance Corporal Coughlin,
India Company 3-5.

279
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,920
Thank you.

280
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,751
Kim. Your hair.

281
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,713
- Thanks, Fahim.
- Mmm-hmm.

282
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,838
You really are a fixer.

283
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,119
Moon's out.

284
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,640
Hmm.

285
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,429
It's beautiful.

286
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,799
Suck my dick!

287
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,269
What does that mean?

288
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,710
- It means, "Oh, what a terrible event!"
- Uh-huh.

289
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,875
Miss Baker.

290
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,791
Colonel Hollanek
is coming to Norton tomorrow

291
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,393
to check on some of our PRT work.

292
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,516
And you and your crew
are clear to tag along.

293
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,313
- Great, thanks.
- Rolls out at zero-six.

294
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,351
- That's 6:00 a.m.
- I know that, yeah.

295
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,198
Fire!

296
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,856
Come on, let's go!
Get this shit together! We gotta move!

297
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,598
Fucking hands out of your pockets!

298
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,193
You think you're in the fucking Army?

299
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,112
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

300
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,669
What is this?

301
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,273
Uh, that's my supplies. Camera stuff.

302
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,157
You fucking kidding me?

303
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,199
This is an orange ruck.
No, ma'am. Not on my vehicle.

304
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,716
The girl at the North Face store
said it was, like, military grade.

305
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,394
Well, where are you gonna hide it?
Inside a fucking sunset?

306
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,790
I mean, even the Dutch Army
don't wear orange.

307
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,233
Fix it.

308
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,031
How do I fix it?

309
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,309
Rapono!

310
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,832
Got to stay hydrated, ma'am.

311
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,150
Coughlin. I didn't recognize you.

312
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,789
That's 'cause I'm in warrior mode.

313
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,598
It makes me taller.

314
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,271
Enjoy the ride, ma'am.

315
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,190
I'm dying to
know who blew up my well.

316
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,599
Working on it, Colonel.

317
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,711
That was a nice fucking well, Corporal.

318
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,560
What'd he say?

319
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,552
What's that mean?

320
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,517
He wants to know
if you are the Russians.

321
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,553
- The Russians?
- Mmm.

322
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,232
No!

323
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,754
No, sir. That was 20 years ago.

324
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,193
And we're here to help.

325
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,232
And I'm black.

326
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,160
The Russians are blacks now.

327
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,074
If we fix the well, you can't blow it up.

328
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,434
Kim, I was talking
to some of the younger men.

329
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,795
They say the Taliban came at night.

330
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,200
I don't care. No. I drank
too much water and I have to pee.

331
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,153
Stop. Stop. I am engaged to be married.

332
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,433
Okay, Fahim,
I know you like your women to be, like,

333
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,829
beautiful, mysterious IKEA bags, okay?

334
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,992
But we urinate, Doctor.
Out of our vaginas.

335
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,999
You think you urinate out the...

336
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,479
No. I know it's a separate thing!

337
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,754
God! Just please help me.

338
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,717
There is nowhere for you to go.

339
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,518
I cannot ask these men about this.

340
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,216
And I'm not allowed to talk to the women.

341
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,391
Fine. Forget it. I'll hold it.
Women are tough, right?

342
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,794
Are you okay, ma'am?

343
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,400
Gosh, damn it, man. This is a new one.

344
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,157
I was cursing your name at 0-stupid-30,
but I'm glad I came out today.

345
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,194
Would you not have gone
on patrol today if I weren't here?

346
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,316
No, I'd be back in Norton filling HESCOs.

347
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,656
Copy that.

348
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,717
We're still 5 mikes.
It must be one hairy dump.

349
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,075
No, I'm just getting my pants on.
Damn it, Sergeant Hurd.

350
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,428
Whatever.

351
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,600
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

352
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,715
Marine!

353
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,512
Make a hole, Baker.

354
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,033
Move out!

355
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,109
Why are we stopping?

356
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,838
The lead vehicle bottomed out.

357
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,878
Okay! Heads on a swivel!

358
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,438
Didn't we come this way?

359
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,877
We most surely did.

360
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,956
- Contact left!
- Stay in the vehicle!

361
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,795
Shit! Hot! Hot bullet things!

362
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,033
Kim, don't get out of the car! Kim!

363
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,392
Whoa!

364
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,914
Get down behind the engine block!

365
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,797
Stay there! Stay there!

366
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,556
Kim.

367
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,959
Get back in the car!

368
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,710
No, please, Kim!

369
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,877
Ma'am, I asked you to stay put!

370
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,439
Those assholes tried to shoot us!

371
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,195
Jesus!

372
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,316
You have got to be shitting me!

373
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,597
You just shot a Javelin at a fucking car!

374
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,069
That's an $80,000 piece of ordnance!

375
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,232
Can any of you geniuses tell me
the Kelley Blue Book value

376
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,153
of a 1989 Toyota pickup?

377
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,597
Oorah, Baker. Get some.

378
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,120
I hope you got all that on film, ma'am.

379
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,316
'Cause that right there,
that's what we do best.

380
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,833
Hearts and minds.

381
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,718
That's the two best places
to shoot somebody.

382
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,915
What?

383
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,678
I told you to stay in the car.

384
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,716
Okay, I'll get back in the car.

385
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,760
<i>The Marines don't have
much to say about Iraq.</i>

386
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,910
<i>Their mantra is that
they are focused on doing the job here.</i>

387
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,991
<i>And even though, as we saw firsthand,</i>

388
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,311
<i>attacks against coalition forces are up,</i>

389
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,597
<i>Corporal Coughlin told me earlier
that he is still not planning</i>

390
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,990
<i>to lock and load his weapon
when he is out on patrol.</i>

391
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,514
<i>Our own Kim Baker reporting for us live.</i>

392
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,634
Welcome!

393
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,753
Wow, good job, Kim! Ruthless!

394
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,352
Bitch, we are going out tonight! Whoo!

395
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,638
It's okay. It's okay. Here.

396
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,555
It's okay. It's all right.

397
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,634
Why don't I know who you are?

398
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,232
You're what, like, 42?

399
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,320
Sold.

400
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,719
Why have I never heard of you?

401
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,196
Yeah, I haven't done
a lot of overseas reporting.

402
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,477
I've done mostly domestic <i>reportage.</i>

403
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,875
<i>"Reportage"?</i>

404
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,793
Domestic <i>reportage.</i>

405
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,197
Look, everyone in the Kabubble
is full of shit. It's okay.

406
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,474
Half the accents are fake.

407
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:27,553
The whole "I'm ex-Special Forces"
wankers are flat out lying.

408
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,518
<i>"Reportage"?</i>

409
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,439
Oh, Christ, what is this?

410
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,240
I really shouldn't have
my back to the door.

411
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,753
It's bad tradecraft,

412
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,513
but it's worth it to
talk to you two ladies.

413
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,513
- Fuck off.
- Ugh.

414
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,199
You got it.

415
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,756
Champagne?

416
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,193
Thank you.

417
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,549
Finish this,

418
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,915
and then we'll go meet some friends
in Wazir Akbar Khan.

419
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,719
And I am warning you now,
do not sleep with lain.

420
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,756
- Who is lain?
- He's a proper asshole.

421
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,836
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

422
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,515
Is that a cab?

423
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,992
Is your full name Shakira?

424
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,469
'Cause I thought it was
a Colombian nickname.

425
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,675
Why would you think that?

426
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,896
Because of the singer.

427
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:18,436
No, I know. I'm kidding.
No, it's Arabic for "thankful."

428
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,158
Kim is American for "white lady."

429
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,710
Actually, "Kim"
means "who" in Turkish.

430
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,638
"Who's that white lady?"

431
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,153
It's Kim.

432
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,708
That's so you can remember my name.

433
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,514
So... This is Iain. Iain, Kim.

434
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,390
Kim. Kim. Kim. Kim, nice work.

435
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,593
You sit next to the only two women
in a country the size of Texas

436
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,875
that remind a man
that you're really only okay looking.

437
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,674
Well, she said you were an asshole,

438
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,096
but that's really above and beyond.

439
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,155
- Who said that?
- Tanya.

440
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,673
No. No. No. I don't think so.

441
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,512
A lot of women find me
very charming, Kim.

442
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,273
- No, not biological women.
- Oh, really?

443
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,679
Women who think that an accent

444
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,795
is the same thing

445
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,359
- as a personality, maybe.
- Oh!

446
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,896
<i>Nae, haud yer wheesht.</i>

447
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,990
<i>Go bile yer heid, ya wee bampot.</i>

448
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,397
I bet you're wetter than a submarine
with screen doors now.

449
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,480
Oh!

450
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,518
I got that from a pickup book.

451
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,033
- Jesus.
- Oh, yeah.

452
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,120
Mmm.

453
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,869
So what's your deal?

454
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,473
You got chucked over by some guy

455
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,192
so you think, "Forget him."

456
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,271
"I'm gonna go discover
the wonders of the East,"

457
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,669
"and I'm gonna fuck a Scottish guy
and write a book."

458
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,352
I'm Scottish, by the way.

459
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,798
Cheers.

460
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,313
Cheers.

461
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,312
- Cheers.
<i>- Salud.</i>

462
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,271
- Cheers.
- To Kim!

463
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,152
Is this your first night out?

464
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,753
Yes.

465
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,558
It is, actually.

466
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,913
That little bastard!

467
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Oh, no, Kim.

468
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,640
You didn't give Egg Boy
money, did you?

469
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,755
Hey! Egg Boy! Hey!
You're a little shitbird!

470
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,672
I hope you get salmonella!

471
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,478
Oh!

472
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,592
I gave him, like, $100!

473
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,113
- $100?
- What?

474
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,114
I'd give you my eggs for $100.

475
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,469
Where are we going?

476
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,994
A whorehouse.
You're going to love it.

477
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,669
You see that?

478
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,670
It's a brothel
and a Chinese restaurant.

479
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,200
Do you remember this video?

480
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,713
Everybody was drawings.

481
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,190
Me? Oh, no, thank you.

482
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,236
Look, a month ago,
I was writing a story about corn syrup.

483
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,117
Okay? I was not happy.

484
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,589
I didn't think there was anything else
out there for me.

485
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,954
Just death.

486
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,296
Then this came along and...

487
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,992
I don't care.

488
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,755
Wenge, do you guys have
regular access to healthcare?

489
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,896
He called me a Fenian bastard.

490
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,230
I fuckin' showed him what for,
kicked his teeth in, the cunt.

491
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,551
Oi, Tanya? What's her story?

492
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,992
She has a boyfriend.
And she's unconscious, okay?

493
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,548
Not that either of those things
have ever stopped you before.

494
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,517
That's not true. That's not true.

495
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,636
- Firstly, I'm afraid of boyfriends.
- Mmm-hmm.

496
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,756
Secondly, I'm a gentleman.

497
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,999
What? According to no less
an authority than Grace Mugabe.

498
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,593
I held a door open for her once.

499
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,875
Let me just
have a little peekaboo.

500
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,279
Get out!

501
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,157
Actually, not bad.

502
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,354
- I think I missed one.
- Stop!

503
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,669
<i>Il y a du monde au balcon. Pas mal.</i>

504
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,954
Kim?

505
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,439
You all right there, mate?

506
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,033
Oh, wouldn't you like to know?

507
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,792
Hey. I'm just talking about her safety.

508
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,429
Nic here does security for Kim, Iain.

509
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,473
Right, well!

510
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,676
I'm off. Excuse me.

511
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,040
- Excused.
- Good night.

512
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,111
- Bye, darling!
- Good night.

513
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,876
The best, Nic!

514
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,392
Oh, that's Oprah.

515
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,680
Hello.

516
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,228
It's Fahim. Are you ready to go?

517
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,230
Go where, dude? It's Saturday.

518
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,669
Friday is the only day off
in the Islamic week.

519
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,159
We have interviews.

520
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,077
No! That was not made clear.
That's... No.

521
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,196
That's bullshit, Fahim. No.

522
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,999
Kim, today we are meeting
Ali Massoud Sadiq.

523
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,839
<i>I sent research.
He's likely to be Attorney General.</i>

524
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,271
- Please hold.
- Please come outside.

525
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,557
This is against what I believe
as an American.

526
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,631
I am sorry, but we have to go.

527
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,512
<i>Oh, my shoes. Shit.</i>

528
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,114
You wish to interview me, Mr. Ahmadzai?

529
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,552
I do, Mr. Sadiq. Yes, on camera.

530
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,712
Mr. Ahmadzai,

531
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,791
I am a person of,

532
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,110
of no consequence.

533
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,474
Well, you soon might be

534
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,994
the second most powerful
person in Afghanistan.

535
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,274
Mr. Ahmadzai,

536
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,636
I run a small department
inside the Interior Ministry.

537
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,837
What possible interest
could I be to the Americans?

538
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:54,435
Because your Ministry
for the Prevention of Vice

539
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,391
and the Encouragement of Virtue

540
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,598
sounds a lot like the Taliban's
old Ministry of Vice and Virtue.

541
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,599
Don't you think?

542
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,311
- Kim Baker.
- Mmm-hmm.

543
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,634
When the Taliban was in power,

544
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,359
they enforced their version of sharia.

545
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,776
One of their edicts was a rule that

546
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,439
all men must shave
the hair of their pubis.

547
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:32,314
They would walk the streets
carrying a small wooden rod,

548
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,072
a dowel,

549
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,436
which they would roll
along the front of a man's trousers.

550
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:41,752
If a man's pubic hair was long enough
to curl around the dowel,

551
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,111
they would beat him.

552
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,349
Now, I ask you,

553
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,794
do I look like a man to walk the streets

554
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,519
carrying a hair-of-the-pubis dowel?

555
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,278
No, sir, you do not.

556
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,633
I returned to this country to save it.

557
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,990
I am a friend of America.

558
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,616
Which is why you should
let me interview you,

559
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,790
so people can understand that.

560
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,033
I like you, Kim.

561
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,151
I like your mouthiness.

562
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,120
That is a word, yes?

563
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,914
It reminds me of my time
living in London.

564
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,510
You make me feel
like a young man again.

565
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,351
But I do not know you.

566
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,598
How can we
get to know each other, Kim?

567
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,280
Hmm?

568
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,310
Yes, excellent, Kim!

569
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,114
Put a turban on her,
she'd make a very handsome boy.

570
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,472
<i>How are you? You okay there?</i>

571
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,696
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

572
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,836
It's probably
just a wedding somewhere nearby.

573
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,797
They like to shoot off
guns at weddings here.

574
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,438
You get it, you're from Florida.

575
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,993
<i>Funny.</i>

576
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,479
<i>When was the last time I saw you?</i>

577
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,959
<i>Since June?</i>

578
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,554
I'm sorry that I didn't
get back last month.

579
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,591
I can be in New York by Thursday.

580
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,672
I miss you and I want to see you. And I...

581
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,159
I have...

582
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,196
Oh, not again.

583
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,312
I hate this fucking airport.

584
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,120
Can I bring you guys
anything from New York?

585
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,389
Just bring us back a six pack, eh?

586
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,951
- This is Kim.
<i>- Kim Baker?</i>

587
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,071
It is Sadiq.

588
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,390
Mr. Sadiq, hi.

589
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,872
How about an interview
with Pacha Khan?

590
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,712
Pacha Khan, the warlord?

591
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,472
<i>Pacha Khan is a businessman.</i>

592
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,394
Would you like that?

593
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,870
Uh, yeah. Yeah. But I'm on my way
to New York to see my boyfriend.

594
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,269
<i>You will be the first Western journalist</i>

595
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,590
<i>to interview him since the Soviet War.</i>

596
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,797
<i>Shall we say tomorrow?</i>

597
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,552
Okay, yes, of course. Thank you.

598
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,399
- What?
- Back in the car.

599
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,469
Wait here.

600
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,913
It's okay, come.

601
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,479
She is a Muslim?

602
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,109
Yes.

603
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,957
Have her pray for me.

604
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,833
She is Turkish.

605
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,240
You wouldn't understand her anyway.

606
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,520
Hmm.

607
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,713
- Okay. Yes.
- Yeah?

608
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,835
Okay.

609
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,428
Pacha Khan, thank you
for your kind hospitality.

610
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,996
Put a turban on her and she
would make a handsome boy!

611
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,515
What?

612
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,274
No.

613
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,599
Oh, Kim. Cheers.

614
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,999
Hi.

615
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,115
What a rush, yeah?

616
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,159
Pacha Khan, yeah.
It's like, adrenaline. Everyone was...

617
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,593
Good job.

618
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,999
Yeah, it went well.

619
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:42,152
But, you know, I was... I was in the...

620
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,112
The New Zealand SAS back home.

621
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,714
And today felt like
jumping out of an airplane.

622
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:50,157
Or like, you know, like having sex.

623
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,949
Kim!

624
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,119
Tanya's got scotch.
It won't last long, so...

625
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,157
Nic, you're welcome, too, you big cunt!

626
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,511
That's a term of affection, by the way.

627
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,272
You were supposed to be
in New York, sneaky girl.

628
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,437
Yeah, Chris is not super pleased.

629
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,875
Chris can suck a fat one.

630
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,797
I'm trying to see if they put my story up,

631
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,235
but this Internet connection is the worst!

632
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,396
Oh, Goddamn it, Jaweed!

633
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,629
Oh, Christ!

634
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,559
- Really?
- Wow.

635
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,868
Although, donkeys aside,

636
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,188
- he's a good fixer.
- Mmm.

637
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,836
Oh, no, thanks. Morning shows.

638
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,428
You have something
they want for the mornings?

639
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,798
Maybe. I don't know. Maybe.

640
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,035
Hmm.

641
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,798
That's what I'm trying to see.

642
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,397
You know, I heard
that he has contacts in the Tribals.

643
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,278
Like real Taliban contacts.

644
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,439
- Jaweed?
- Jaweed.

645
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,274
- No fucking way.
- Mmm, apparently.

646
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,313
Would you do that?
Would you go down there?

647
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,675
Yeah, sure, if it was the right call.

648
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,240
Yeah, but how do you know
if it's the right call?

649
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,756
Fuck, man, I don't know.

650
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,910
That is why we drink, do drugs

651
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,468
and shag strangers
in restaurant bathrooms.

652
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,936
<i>Kim, are you okay? What's going on?</i>

653
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,996
Oh, shoot. Oh, sorry, what time is it?

654
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,672
<i>I don't know. I'm in Seattle.</i>

655
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,856
<i>God, I thought you got shot
at a wedding or something.</i>

656
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,915
<i>- Jesus, Kim!</i>
- No.

657
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,951
Sorry. So, just real quick...

658
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,268
I want you to come visit me.

659
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,588
<i>In Afghanistan? Really?</i>

660
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,736
I mean, I've got tons of miles.

661
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,816
I could fly you first class.

662
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,056
<i>I have to look at a calendar.
I don't think I can do it this month.</i>

663
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,296
<i>I'm here until, like, at least the 15th.</i>

664
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,440
<i>But when I get back maybe...</i>

665
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,511
- Who is in your bed, Chris?
<i>- What?</i>

666
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,152
<i>No, that's my bag.</i>

667
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,390
Look in the mirror, dipshit.

668
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,153
My God. You motherfucker.
Unbelievable. Unbelievable!

669
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,559
<i>You calm the fuck down!</i>

670
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,392
<i>Listen, you haven't
been home in months.</i>

671
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,696
<i>You forgot my fucking birthday!</i>

672
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,376
Oh, right, it's my fault.
Great, Chris. You're a genius.

673
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,595
<i>And I kept your stupid
fucking plants alive,</i>

674
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,240
<i>but you let this relationship
wither and die!</i>

675
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,317
Ugh! Did you have that prepared?

676
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,400
<i>- What?</i>
- Pussy!

677
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,856
You know what? Have fun in Seattle.

678
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,056
You should go to the
Rock 'n' Roll Museum.

679
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,399
It sucks. You'll fit right in.

680
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,838
Are you shitting me?

681
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,635
Fahim.

682
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,711
Let's apply for another embed.

683
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,952
Because I want to get out of Kabul.

684
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,271
I just need to get out of Kabul.

685
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,195
I need "me time", exactly. That's...

686
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,599
See? I told you that <i>O</i> magazine

687
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,638
would increase your
understanding of women.

688
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,914
Hey, you guys are 3-5, right?

689
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,871
Do you know a Corporal Coughlin?

690
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
No, ma'am.

691
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,514
Sorry, but I've only been here
for a couple months.

692
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,392
Ma'am, if you set one foot
in front of the other,

693
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,472
there's less chance
you lose both feet if we hit an IED.

694
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,153
<i>Vides, make ready.</i>

695
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,750
Man, we are definitely losing the war

696
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,990
when it comes to this particular well.

697
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,351
I swear to God,
they blow up another well,

698
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,696
I take another pair of boots off.

699
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,836
It's like fucking musical chairs.

700
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,477
Hey, do I have to buy a dress
for your wedding?

701
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,791
No. Whatever you wear in Kabul is fine.

702
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,631
- Yeah?
- Yes.

703
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:26,355
The only thing I ask is that
you make sure my friend is there.

704
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,350
Aw, your friend is me.

705
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,439
I get it.

706
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,150
- Mount up!
- Jesus, Stern!

707
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,193
General, excuse me.
Hey. General, do you have a minute?

708
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,669
- Not now, Baker.
- It's just...

709
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,954
The Taliban haven't been
destroying the well here.

710
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,640
The women of the village
are destroying it.

711
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,358
Or so they tell me.

712
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,915
We dug that well several times
for the women

713
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,672
so they don't have to walk to the river.

714
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,518
But they want to walk to the river.

715
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,160
It's their only chance to be social

716
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,515
and gossip and, you know, hang out.

717
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,313
I think that they have a bunch
of old Soviet landmines,

718
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,551
and they just prop one up
and throw rocks at it.

719
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,995
Kim, did you ever feel like
you're manning that tollgate

720
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,953
and the engineer's yelling,
"I got pig iron, I got pig iron"?

721
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,633
No. I don't know what that means.
But it's very folksy.

722
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,915
Also, the women, obviously,
they don't want the men

723
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,558
to know about this, so they are hoping

724
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:34,234
that you would just refuse
to repair the well this time.

725
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,320
Well, they're in luck.

726
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,795
That's exactly what
I told the mullah, so...

727
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,993
Well done, Baker.

728
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,279
Hooyah, General.

729
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,909
Marines say "Oorah."

730
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,195
The Navy says "Hooyah."

731
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,271
- Don't mix those two up.
- Got it.

732
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,078
Have a good... Have a good ride.

733
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,835
Kim.

734
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,800
Kim.

735
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,200
Sorry.

736
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,670
- You look beautiful!
- You look beautiful!

737
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:45,760
Oh, my God.

738
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,791
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no!

739
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,239
Kim!

740
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,354
What the dick?

741
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,476
Why did Fahim tell me
I could dress like this?

742
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,074
Well, he didn't want you
to have to go buy something.

743
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,000
Oh, my God. I only washed
the front of my hair.

744
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,200
Here. You know what?

745
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,656
I'm going to let you have one of these.

746
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,908
Thank you.

747
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,599
Now I look great.

748
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,874
Now you're ready.

749
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,029
Now I'm ready to party.

750
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,155
Oh, she likes it.

751
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,360
- Sure.
- Oh, wow. Well...

752
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,111
It was worse than a unibrow.
It went all the way into his hair.

753
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,416
We all have some reason

754
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,509
for being here.

755
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,113
What's your reason?

756
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,235
What is yours?

757
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,696
I don't have a good one. I'm just here.

758
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,551
Come on, she just told her unibrow story.

759
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,993
I just... I don't have one.

760
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,149
Come on.

761
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:57,393
I was at the gym after work
one night. Stationary bike.

762
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,713
Okay? The same bike every day.

763
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,473
And I notice this

764
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,629
indentation in the carpet,

765
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,280
it's, like, a foot in front of my bike.

766
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,316
And I realize that it's from
where my bike used to be.

767
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:16,915
I have done thousands
of miles on this bike

768
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,996
and I have gone backwards.

769
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,310
I have literally gone backwards.

770
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,594
I just

771
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,317
wanted to blow everything up.
I just wanted out of my job,

772
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,188
writing news scripts for
dumb pretty people to read.

773
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,633
I wanted...

774
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,670
out of having to decide whether

775
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,991
I should just marry
my mildly depressive boyfriend.

776
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,473
And that's it.

777
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,034
I just... I couldn't look at that

778
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,832
fucking carpet anymore.

779
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,158
Oh...

780
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,351
Well, that is officially the most

781
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,635
American white lady
story I've ever heard.

782
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,075
- Shut up.
- It is.

783
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,428
You know what? Fuck that.

784
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:07,036
You are a battle-tested
foreign correspondent.

785
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:10,396
You're a solid Kabul 9.5.

786
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,789
And you are fucking single, all right?

787
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,792
So that lady back at the gym, she's dead.

788
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,119
This is your life.

789
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,076

00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,429
Thank you.

801
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,953
Congratulations on your promotion,

802
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,696
- Mr. Attorney General.
- Thank you.

803
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,336
As I said, we could have
done this over the phone.

804
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,828
I'm just looking for a statement
on sharia in Kandahar.

805
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,797
I understand that you are no longer

806
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,711
with your special friend Chris.

807
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,315
Who told you that?

808
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,913
Very little happens in Afghanistan

809
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,231
that Ali Massoud Sadiq
does not know about.

810
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,389
Very little.

811
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,109
May I show you something?

812
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,269
Of course.

813
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,239
You have a bed in your office.

814
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,389
Yes.

815
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,037
There is a bed here now.

816
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,998
So, no comment
on sharia in Kandahar or...

817
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,073
No comment.

818
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,594
- We are going to ISAF later, yes?
- I don't know.

819
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,228
Pressers and "right of boom" crap.
Who cares?

820
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,616
We need to enterprise something. Okay?

821
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,676
We need to get out of the bubble.

822
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,639
Oh, that hit the net.

823
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,832
- The what?
- It hit the net.

824
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,151
- The invisible net?
- Yes.

825
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,912
- My point.
- Let's go. Bullshit.

826
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,616
You know, Kim, the reason that your
village well story got traction is

827
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,154
because it wasn't a bang-bang,
it was about women's rights.

828
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,038
It was a brilliant piece, that.

829
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,394
Oh, fucking hell.

830
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,749
We should go to Kandahar.

831
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:35,989
No, too dangerous.

832
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,315
No way. It's a wee bit
fluid down there these days,

833
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,515
security-wise.

834
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,400
Yeah, it might
be a bit much for you, eh, Nic?

835
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,496
You're a bit late to the whole.

836
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,160
"Kandahar's gone
to shit" party. You know?

837
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,216
What about the woman thing
where the sharia law is back?

838
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,936
And there was a firebombing
there the other day.

839
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,056
Yeah, I think it's worth the risk.

840
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,798
Iain, that's easy for you to say, mate,

841
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,713
sitting there in your cozzie taking
photos of the fucking garden.

842
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,109
Look, Nicky,
I know you've been specially trained

843
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,873
to protect New Zealand from,
what, fucking dolphins?

844
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,316
But I'm not exactly
a war zone virgin, you know?

845
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,039
I was kidnapped by the AIG
when they were still called that.

846
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,553
Why dolphins?

847
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,816
What do dolphins got to do
with New Zealand?

848
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,856
Nothing to do with it. I'm just...

849
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,029
White pointers and sharks,

850
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,256
but the dolphins never hurt anyone.

851
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,736
I know they've not hurt anyone, mate.
I'm just making the point...

852
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,040
I'm not gonna protect my country

853
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,832
from an animal that hasn't hurt anyone.

854
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,114
Oh, Jesus Christ.

855
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,119
Dolphins? What a joke.

856
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,816
I'll come with you
in the car if there's room.

857
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,558
Oh, great, we're all going to Kandahar!

858
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,072
I can make some calls.
We can take my car.

859
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,630
Kim, if we are going to Kandahar,

860
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,149
you will need to buy some new clothes.

861
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,909
I can't...

862
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,072
Ah! It's so pretty,
I don't even want to vote.

863
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,240
I'm flipping you the bird
in here right now.

864
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,816
- Is this your car, Fahim?
- Yes.

865
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,256
This is a fucking piece of shit.

866
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,032
I think it's very nice.

867
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,712
No one is staring at me. It's weird.

868
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,633
You are in the Blue Prison now.

869
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,960
Fahim, what does the graffiti say?

870
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,390
"No education for woman."

871
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,152
- Brian.
- Huh?

872
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,759
Fahim, what's going on up there?

873
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,029
The Taliban used to do this.

874
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,474
Execute the radios and televisions.

875
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,471
Oh, shit!

876
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,376
Get out of the way!

877
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,674
Move on! Move on!

878
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,035
You guys can't go
out there, but I can.

879
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,350
- Kim, come back.
- Kim, wait! Come back.

880
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,800
Kim, now.
We must hurry. We must hurry.

881
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,873
Get in the car!

882
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,232
Get out of here!

883
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,708
That was a men's park, Kim! Men only!

884
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,549
Fuck!

885
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,791
<i>Bebakhshid,</i> Fahim.

886
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,559
coalition capacity,

887
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,198
priorities and support.

888
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:48,036
Let's look now at the 12 first-tier
drivers in the current COIN paradigm.

889
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:49,680
Shit.

890
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,591
Tactical and institutional...

891
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:52,976
is always in purple,

892
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,319
and noting as such...

893
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:56,513
Kim Baker.

894
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,953
Sir, do you have a minute?

895
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,912
If I'm understanding this briefing,

896
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,718
I have all the fucking time in the world.

897
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,155
Okay.
Well, I'm covering the girls' school

898
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,594
in Kandahar that was firebombed

899
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,752
and I'm wondering if you could
give me something, on background,

900
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:12,276
just about the security situation here

901
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,191
and the state of the war in general.

902
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,753
Yeah, I can give you something.

903
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,273
This war is like fucking a gorilla.

904
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,510
You keep going till
the gorilla wants to stop.

905
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,511
I think I can paraphrase that.

906
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,993
<i>Knock yourself out.</i>

907
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:43,793
You know, Afghanistan produces
90% of the world's narcotic opiates.

908
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:45,313
- So they say.
- Mmm.

909
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:49,318
When I worked in the hospital,

910
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:52,392
these men, heroin addicts,

911
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,233
would come in with a child.

912
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:58,073
They'd say,
"Oh, my son, he broke his arm."

913
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:01,594
And while we were tending to the child,

914
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,910
the men would steal our morphine.

915
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:08,798
And we would wonder
how the arm got broken to begin with.

916
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,030
What are we talking about, Fahim?

917
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:13,360
Hmm.

918
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:17,672
The human body
produces its own heroin.

919
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,035
In fact, when the fight-or-flight instinct

920
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:22,350
is activated in the hypothalamus,

921
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:27,434
your body releases endorphins,
dopamine and norepinephrine.

922
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:33,190
That is heroin, cocaine
and amphetamine, all at once.

923
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,795
Okay, great. Are we having
the Afghan version of this conversation,

924
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,096
where in New York we would have

925
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,554
gotten to the point,
like, five minutes ago?

926
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,956
There is a reason
to believe that a person

927
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,548
can get addicted to this type of high.

928
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:52,028
Soldiers, athletes...

929
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,076
War reporters. Got it.

930
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:58,879
An addict always needs
a greater and greater dosage.

931
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,839
And then people
make mistakes, people get hurt.

932
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:05,832
I get it. You're a newlywed. I can

933
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,480
probably get them
to go up to $125 a day.

934
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,918
Let us have the

935
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:22,595
American version of this conversation.

936
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,115
Okay.

937
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:28,673
I do not want to work with you anymore.

938
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,030
No, okay, wait.
Fahim, I know I fucked up.

939
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,554
I do not think you do.

940
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,830
- Hear me out.
- Kim, no.

941
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:41,270
I am now married.
I want to have children.

942
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:43,351
It will not happen again. It's not gonna...

943
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:48,474
"I ride after a deer
and find myself chased by a hog."

944
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,878
"I plot to get what I want"

945
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,717
"and I end up in prison."

946
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:57,315
"I dig pits to trap others and I fall in."

947
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,794
"I should be suspicious of what I want."

948
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:04,351
I don't know what that means.

949
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:09,993
You do.

950
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:18,160
Fahim?

951
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,038
I can't breathe in here.

952
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,353
Time to take a walk.

953
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:07,552
I have to go outside.

954
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,196
I have to go home.

955
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,479
Put on your headscarf.

956
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:36,514
Shit.

957
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:37,953
It's the wrong house.

958
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,593
Oh, shit.

959
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,911
Kim?

960
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,718
What the hell are you doing?

961
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:16,994
Here.

962
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:21,073
Kim, sip that. Okay? You all right?

963
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:25,158
Keep sipping that.
You're all right. It's okay.

964
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:26,593
It's okay. Hey.

965
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:28,776
Hey, it's all right.

966
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:31,837
Oi. Now, that there was a bit of fun.

967
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:33,240
- Are you mental?
- Okay, mate...

968
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:34,816
I'm not your mate.
I'm gonna ask you again,

969
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:35,875
are you fucking mental?

970
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:39,236
- Come on, lain, it's not his fault.
- What's your job again? Hmm?

971
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,896
Because if I hadn't
come back to see you lot

972
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,136
because I stole a bottle of sake

973
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,296
from a Japanese travel writer...

974
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,355
Wait, you have sake?

975
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:45,873
you could've killed her, "mate!"

976
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,552
Oh, fuck off.

977
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:51,354
Jesus! What the fuck?

978
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,280
Dude, what the fuck?

979
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,431
Did you fucking sucker punch me?

980
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:56,953
You broke my nose.

981
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,630
- You fucking American?
- Are you a Yank?

982
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,671
- I'm Canadian, you asshole.
- Ugh.

983
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,758
I almost fucked a Canadian?

984
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:06,718
I'd stay down if I were you, ya wee cunt.

985
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:08,910
And that's not a term of affection.

986
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:11,359
Fuck that.

987
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,316
Oh, God! Mmm.

988
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:27,593
Ow!

989
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:28,909
- Wait.
- Oh, fuck.

990
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:32,669
Iain, don't carry me around.
I'm not a fucking baby.

991
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:35,628
- Ah!
- Goddamn it.

992
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:37,392
What the fuck are you doing?

993
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,696
- Take it off.
- I'm fucking trying to take it off!

994
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,915
Oh, God, I'm gonna put it
in you so fucking hard,

995
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,376
- you're gonna fucking get it.
- Shh. Don't talk.

996
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,576
I want everything in your mouth.

997
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:50,635
Iain, just shut it.

998
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:53,314
I'll take you lying down, come on.

999
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,113
Do you have one of those
weird little penises?

1000
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,350
No! This is how I want to go.

1001
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,476
No, I don't want to see myself.

1002
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,079
Roll off!

1003
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,231
Okay, fuck it.

1004
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:08,914
Oh, God, I fucking...

1005
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,069
What are you doing?

1006
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,549
I'm just putting my fucking
finger in your mouth.

1007
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:13,640
Shh. No!

1008
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,400
Come on, just put
everything in your mouth.

1009
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:18,514
Do you want me to go?

1010
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:19,919
No.

1011
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,312
There's aught like a good shag.

1012
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:38,830
Okay, let's try to be adults here.

1013
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,513
I think we were.

1014
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:43,638
Obviously this was just
a Kabubble thing, right?

1015
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:44,755
Just a

1016
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:48,711
fun mistake where one
of us had an orgasm.

1017
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:52,273
I mean, we're both in a really bad place.
And then you

1018
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,750
punched Nic.

1019
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:56,958
I don't know. It's endorphins, right?

1020
01:03:58,440 --> 01:03:59,919
Nope, that's not what this is.

1021
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,672
No, you don't need to be gallant.

1022
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,518
I'm serious.

1023
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:07,717
I fancy you, Kim Baker.

1024
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:09,634
I do.

1025
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:13,795
Of all the dozens of women
in this country, I chose you.

1026
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,677
No, you didn't, because this is not me.

1027
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:16,829
I would never do this.

1028
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:19,520
Precisely. Because
you're not you anymore.

1029
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,556
You're in the Kabubble.
You said so yourself.

1030
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:23,949
Don't fucking hide.

1031
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,788
Kim, you know the frog
in the pot of water?

1032
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:30,997
You raise the temperature bit by bit,

1033
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:32,712
the frog doesn't notice?

1034
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,199
That's what this place

1035
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,236
and that's what this job does to all of us.

1036
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:40,790
It changes your perception
of what's normal until...

1037
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,392
until here we are.

1038
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:47,273
You know the frog boils to death

1039
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:48,952
- at the end of that, right?
- Nope.

1040
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:50,234
- Yeah.
- Nope.

1041
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,396
Is that my toothbrush?

1042
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:00,800
Ugh!

1043
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:04,514
<i>What's going on
with my Kandahar piece, Ed?</i>

1044
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,079
<i>Jerry killed it.</i>

1045
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,160
Wait, who killed it?

1046
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,748
<i>Jerry Taub, head of the network, Kim.</i>

1047
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:11,592
- What happened to Angela?
<i>- She left.</i>

1048
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:14,911
<i>She's running a website
for women or something.</i>

1049
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:18,749
<i>Look, I can't sell
Afghanistan in Monday meetings.</i>

1050
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:22,196
<i>Your war's got chronic
same-shit-different-day-itis.</i>

1051
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:24,589
Great. What am I even doing here, Ed?

1052
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:27,956
<i>I wouldn't ask that too loudly, Kim.</i>

1053
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:31,635
<i>Though I'd be thrilled to have
you back at your old desk.</i>

1054
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,953
That's all I got.

1055
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:45,796
Hey, I heard that Nic quit
and you fucked Iain!

1056
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:46,915
Whoa, hold on.

1057
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,275
Listen, the Iain thing
is not a thing, okay?

1058
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,476
We have the same size hands. I can't.

1059
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:54,199
It's just work has been
a little frustrating.

1060
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:55,315
Yeah. I get it.

1061
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,152
Because Afghanistan
doesn't rate anymore.

1062
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:58,639
That is bullshit.

1063
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,376
You've got to find
your own luck here, babe,

1064
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:01,628
you know that.

1065
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:05,868
What?

1066
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:08,553
What? What is that?

1067
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:11,029
Hey! You're hooking up
Tanya in the Tribals?

1068
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:12,519
What the fuck, Jaweed?

1069
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,272
Her network will pay me triple.

1070
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,296
I taught you how to clear
your Internet history, okay?

1071
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:17,912
What has Vanderpoel ever done for you?

1072
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,353
Give me a break, man.

1073
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:21,596
Whatever. You owe me.
What else do you have?

1074
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:22,749
You're Ghilzai, right?

1075
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,239
Do you have any other connections

1076
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,673
to members of the Ghilzai family?

1077
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,398
- You mean Hekmatyar?
- Maybe.

1078
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:29,755
Are you fucking crazy, Kim? Please.

1079
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:33,032
Hey! Nabil! Hey.

1080
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:34,957
Are you still in touch with that ISI guy

1081
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:37,679
who says he knows
who killed Abdul Haq?

1082
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,479
That guy?
He's dead two years.

1083
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:55,155
Hey.

1084
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,656
Oh, for fuck's sake.

1085
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:06,999
Mrs. MacKelpie.

1086
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:12,589
Twice?

1087
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:13,696
Two and a half, actually.

1088
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:14,720
Ugh!

1089
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:17,828
I don't remember
what happened last night.

1090
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:20,269
Kabul happened,
my wee froggy in the pot.

1091
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:22,874
Did I not wear a headscarf?
Where's my phone?

1092
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,136
I believe I threw your mobile
in my cupboard.

1093
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:25,229
Why?

1094
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:27,550
Because mid-coitus
you tried to call Tanya

1095
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:29,716
about some bloody wild goose chase
in the Tribals.

1096
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:31,114
I told you about that?

1097
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,336
Mmm. Well, it was hard
to understand you

1098
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:34,999
once you asked me
to stuff your knickers in your mouth.

1099
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:38,192
I'm joking, Kim. That didn't happen.

1100
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,157
Fuck. I am...

1101
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:42,071
I am fucking losing it.

1102
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:44,113
I need a win.

1103
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,336
Christ, if you're that hard up,

1104
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:47,112
I'll share my Badakhshan thing with you.

1105
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,599
What Badakhshan thing?

1106
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:51,274
You know China won the contract
to mine for gold up there.

1107
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:53,828
They built roads, airport,
housing, all that.

1108
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,956
Well, guess whose responsibility it is

1109
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:57,951
to protect the investment of Red China

1110
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:59,917
in this restive nation?

1111
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:04,069
American troops, Chinese gold.
Oh, Iain, that's really good.

1112
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,349
People are gonna get mad.

1113
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:07,376
Just waiting for my guy
to give me the green light.

1114
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,896
You pay for the trip,
I'll share the story with you. Easy peasy.

1115
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:12,593
Really? Thank you. That's...

1116
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:14,629
I owe you one.

1117
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:17,558
Well, how about a half of one?

1118
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:19,016
And then we can make it an even three.

1119
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:21,156
Yeah. Or I could buy you breakfast.

1120
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:24,429
Or a half of one
and we can make it an even three.

1121
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:27,518
I think breakfast
is of equal monetary value.

1122
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,511
My middle name is Eoghan.

1123
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,670
Which is Erse... Shut up.

1124
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:33,352
It's Erse for Owen.

1125
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:34,828
- "Oo-hee"?
- Mmm-hmm.

1126
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:36,831
- Iain "Oo-hee."
- Don't bother.

1127
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:38,194
Where is Bin Laden?

1128
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,376
People think he's in Pakistan, right?

1129
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:40,400
Yeah.

1130
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:42,198
You've got egg in your beard. Hang on.

1131
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:43,349
Thank you.

1132
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:46,159
Your national animal is the unicorn.

1133
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:47,240
I think it's romantic.

1134
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:49,311
That is the national animal
of the kingdom I ruled

1135
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:50,536
when I was eight.

1136
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,551
Who's your favorite Three Stooge?

1137
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:57,113
Um, Larry. Because he's put upon
in a way that I identify with.

1138
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:59,668
He's the Art Garfunkel, right?

1139
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:01,113
Yeah.

1140
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:04,192
So, I thought I might
like to hang out with you for a bit.

1141
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:05,872
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

1142
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,456
Do you really want to
know what I want to do?

1143
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:09,480
Yeah. Okay.

1144
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:10,839
I'd like to kiss you.

1145
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:15,469
Who knew?

1146
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:20,994
Here's my little man.

1147
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:23,230
No, Iain, don't. It's a scam.

1148
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:25,550
Do you think so? Really?

1149
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:28,234
I know it's a scam, Kim. So what?

1150
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:30,356
He's still begging in the street.
Hey, Abrahaim.

1151
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:32,639
There's my boy.

1152
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:45,152
I knew I'd win you over.

1153
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:51,915
Jesus!

1154
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:01,992
What the fuck, Jaweed?
Are they coming or not?

1155
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:03,715
Here they are.

1156
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:10,656
<i>There they are.</i>

1157
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:14,514
4-6800, line six north.

1158
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:20,713
Standing by approval.

1159
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:22,518
We are clear to engage target.

1160
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:24,716
Roger. Clear to engage target.

1161
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,158
It is him. That's my guy.

1162
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:36,776
If we go anywhere,
Jaweed, we take our vehicle.

1163
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:37,915
No carpooling.

1164
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,149
All right. Okay.

1165
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,271
Shit! Shit!

1166
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:51,394
Stay calm.

1167
01:10:58,880 --> 01:10:59,880
Splash.

1168
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:01,313
Cease laser. Safe laser.

1169
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:03,072
Laser off. Laser safe.

1170
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,355
I'm looking for someone. Excuse me.

1171
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:38,591
- Oh, my God. Tanya.
- Hi.

1172
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:40,079
- Jesus.
- Oy.

1173
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:43,557
Jaweed's dead.

1174
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:45,073
Andy's in surgery.

1175
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:46,479
I know. Iain talked to Colin.

1176
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:47,993
Jesus!

1177
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:49,433
I know. It's fucked.

1178
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,791
You know, Colin was rolling.

1179
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:57,555
What, like, rolling-rolling?
You have tape?

1180
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:59,790
He got the whole fucking thing.

1181
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:02,713
I'm going to go live with it
as soon as they let me out of here.

1182
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,550
Can you fucking believe it?

1183
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,393
Hey.

1184
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:09,709
Hi.

1185
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:11,195
Aye.

1186
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:14,000
- How are you?
- You doing all right?

1187
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:17,152
Holy shit!

1188
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:19,310
<i>And as we watch it
again there, Susanna,</i>

1189
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:22,989
<i>you can actually see the Hellfire
missile right before it detonates.</i>

1190
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,073
What is going on with Badakhshan?

1191
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:31,390
Ah, snow's killing us.

1192
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:32,674
So unless your network wants

1193
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:34,376
to stump up the money for the helicopter,

1194
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,789
we'll have to wait
till they clear the passes.

1195
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,496
Kim, we have a bit of a situation outside.

1196
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,520
Oh.

1197
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,149
What?

1198
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:42,958
I just need you
to see something.

1199
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:44,513
Sorry to interrupt.

1200
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:45,816
Did he say what he wanted?

1201
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:46,989
I don't know.

1202
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:52,759
Fuck.

1203
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:59,436
Qadar. Qadar, it's okay. You can go in.

1204
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,873
He just wants to talk to me.

1205
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,672
- Okay. Okay.
- It's okay.

1206
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:05,270
Oh, please, do not cover
your hair on my account.

1207
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:06,713
It's such beautiful hair.

1208
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,995
It's like the hide of a fine horse.

1209
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:11,514
Sadiq, what are you doing here?

1210
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:16,270
I was just going home
from closing a woman brothel

1211
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:18,476
when I told my driver,

1212
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:22,917
"Mahboobullah, this is
where my best friend Kimberly lives!"

1213
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,390
But she has been a bad friend lately.

1214
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:29,232
She does not call.

1215
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:32,633
She does not invite me to her party.

1216
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:34,188
I'm sorry,

1217
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:36,475
but I didn't think the Attorney General

1218
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,755
of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan

1219
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,120
went to parties at guesthouses.

1220
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:41,918
And why not?

1221
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,070
I am still a man, no?

1222
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:46,071
I love music.

1223
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:48,549
I love to dance!

1224
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
But

1225
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:03,594
even though you have been a bad friend,

1226
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,158
I want you to be happy.

1227
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:09,957
Do you have a special friend?

1228
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:12,433
Because.

1229
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:17,113
I would love to be your special friend.

1230
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:20,193
Would you like that, Kim?

1231
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:24,553
You're a bad friend.

1232
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:27,510
You are a bad friend.

1233
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:31,513
In America, I would get
a book deal out of this shit!

1234
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,716
You can't just do this, okay?

1235
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:35,950
I haven't been on the air in months!

1236
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:39,794
My best friend here almost died,
and I am jealous of her!

1237
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:41,713
And I am just...

1238
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:45,119
Fuck this! All of it!

1239
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:10,833
That was a bomb.

1240
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:13,914
Hello! So, wait!

1241
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,434
Who is fronting the show?

1242
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:18,351
Tucker? No, I don't know who that is.

1243
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:21,750
Okay, well, I could go live
for the overnights, but this is...

1244
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:25,071
"Satellite time?"
No, I have a dedicated feed.

1245
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:27,839
Since when?

1246
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,096
<i>This is Tucker Wang.</i>

1247
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:30,269
This is Kim Baker.

1248
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,828
Why am I being told that
I don't have a sat hookup?

1249
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,831
<i>Because you're on
the hourly plan now.</i>

1250
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:36,600
<i>And either way, the show is full tonight.</i>

1251
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:37,834
No. Who is your boss?

1252
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:40,309
I want to talk to this
Jerry whatever, Taub.

1253
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:43,040
<i>Okay, look, Jerry has
mentioned Afghanistan to me once,</i>

1254
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,016
<i>and mentioned it to know why
the only good story to come</i>

1255
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,776
<i>out of there in a year
was on another network.</i>

1256
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,109
What, Tanya's thing?
No, I've got shit like that.

1257
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:50,918
I'm waiting for the snow to melt!

1258
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,433
I want to talk to Jerry.

1259
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:54,176
<i>If I could just get
you to get me a story</i>

1260
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:55,792
<i>that somebody would care about,</i>

1261
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:57,438
<i>it would be fine. But meanwhile...</i>

1262
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:58,576
Okay, what if I come to New York

1263
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:00,636
and I burst into Jerry's office?
How about that?

1264
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:02,536
<i>Well, that might look
like I hadn't done my job.</i>

1265
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,391
Perfect. See you Wednesday.

1266
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:05,520
Cunt.

1267
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:11,357
Kim.

1268
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,391
Kim, look at these dogs.

1269
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:17,278
How does this end?

1270
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:19,351
A bucket of cold water, I suppose.

1271
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:24,080
No.

1272
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:25,639
Um...

1273
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:29,073
How does this

1274
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:31,548
end?

1275
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:37,071
Uh, I don't really know, Kim.

1276
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:41,674
We grow old together?
Get a cottage in the country?

1277
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:43,398
Raise chickens?

1278
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:45,112
Eat scrambled eggs off each other?

1279
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:48,232
Look, we're good, aren't we?
We'll always have Kabul.

1280
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:49,992
No, we won't. We won't "always have" it

1281
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:51,274
because I have to go home.

1282
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:52,998
No, this is home.

1283
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:56,595
I have to go to
New York City and justify my life

1284
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:58,671
to somebody named Jerry

1285
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:01,115
before he takes it all away, and I

1286
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:07,197
cannot go back to sitting
at a goddamn desk. I can't.

1287
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,351
Aye. Listen...

1288
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:11,670
No one can take it away from you.

1289
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:12,988
Not all of it.

1290
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:15,076
Whatever happens, you'll have me.

1291
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:18,797
That's a very nice thing to say, but...

1292
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,109
But what?

1293
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,788
<i>Following a fatal traffic accident
involving a coalition truck,</i>

1294
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:37,108
<i>long simmering frustration</i>

1295
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:40,795
<i>today boiled over
into violence and despair.</i>

1296
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,313
<i>They kill us!</i>

1297
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,391
<i>They kill us and they break our hearts!</i>

1298
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:47,074
<i>And I also give this message
to President Hamid Karzai.</i>

1299
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:49,549
<i>What the hell is happening here?</i>

1300
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,536
Okay, I don't care
who the hell's in there. I'm Kim Baker.

1301
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:15,074
Go on in, Kim. Jerry's expecting you.

1302
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:17,594
Well, that's fucking unsatisfying.

1303
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:18,999
Can I take your bag?

1304
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:20,399
Yes. Please.

1305
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,656
Would you care for some water?

1306
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:23,680
Yes.

1307
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:35,920
I should've Googled you.

1308
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,549
I've been... I've been using all the
wrong swear words.

1309
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:43,110
Well, I hope
I didn't ruin your big moment.

1310
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:45,953
Look, Geri, I don't know what
Tucker has been telling you.

1311
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:48,429
He said that you're upset
about the air time you're getting.

1312
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:51,836
That's just wrong,
because this is not about me.

1313
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:53,956
My frustration is with our priorities

1314
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:56,031
and what's best for the network.

1315
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:59,394
Isn't deciding what's best
for the network my job?

1316
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:02,559
I'm just saying,

1317
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:05,595
as journalists, we have
an obligation to this story.

1318
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:09,229
And Afghanistan should be
on our air more, period.

1319
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:10,992
With the resources we have over there,

1320
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,548
Afghanistan should
definitely be on our air more.

1321
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:17,758
But the problem is,
as much as everyone loves the troops,

1322
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:21,270
they don't actually want to watch
them on the news anymore.

1323
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:22,509
They just don't.

1324
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:25,638
So I can't give Afghanistan more air.

1325
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:29,679
Which means I need
to give Afghanistan fewer resources.

1326
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:32,228
That's what's best for the network.

1327
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:34,159
Geri...

1328
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:35,240
You have that call now.

1329
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:39,839
I'm not trying to be a bitch.

1330
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,176
Okay, let me pitch you something.

1331
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:42,496
All right, the Chinese
mining concession...

1332
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:43,520
Jesus!

1333
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:44,896
Look, the last person who got any kind of

1334
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:46,512
bounce out of Afghanistan

1335
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,352
was your friend Tanya Vanderpoel.

1336
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:51,750
She's actually got me over a barrel
thanks to that drone story.

1337
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:53,600
What do you mean, "over a barrel"?

1338
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:55,033
She's London, Kim.

1339
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:58,716
- You're hiring Tanya.
- Yes.

1340
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,997
I assumed you two flew here together.

1341
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:05,279
She's here.

1342
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:12,592
I'm sorry, you started
talking to her before the UAV strike?

1343
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:14,193
Is UAV a drone?

1344
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:17,474
Hello! Where are you going?

1345
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:20,189
No, I'm only here for a few days.

1346
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:22,199
Oh, I know.

1347
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,389
Oh, fuck.

1348
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:27,632
I don't know what to say to you.

1349
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:29,796
Ducky, I'm sorry. I fucked up.

1350
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:31,472
Did you go to the Tribals

1351
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:33,240
because you were
in a contract negotiation?

1352
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:35,470
Dude, I'm not stealing your job, okay?

1353
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:38,393
Tanya, this is not about my fucking job.

1354
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:41,232
We have to make good calls, right?

1355
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:44,118
And now Andy lost an eye
and Jaweed is dead.

1356
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:46,839
Christ, man, we've both
fucking made mistakes!

1357
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:49,992
No. Tell me you didn't go to the Tribals
because of a contract.

1358
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:54,237
You would have done exactly what I did
if Jaweed had gone to you.

1359
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,912
No. I'm not you.

1360
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:04,471
Do you remember your first embed?

1361
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:07,831
You interviewed a young Marine?

1362
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:08,920
Coughlin? Yes. What?

1363
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,515
Yeah, well, after they aired your story,

1364
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:16,752
where you used his soundbite
about not loading his rifle,

1365
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:18,751
they sent him to Helmand.

1366
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:21,471
And he got his legs blown off.

1367
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:23,793
So I hear.

1368
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:30,953
See you in Kabul.

1369
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:04,072
<i>I'm not really
surprised she chased the story.</i>

1370
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:05,958
That's what we do. That's what you do.

1371
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:07,075
I would do it.

1372
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:11,559
Sorry.

1373
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:14,399
Goddamn it, I'm tired.

1374
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:15,799
You booked your return yet?

1375
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:17,736
'Cause you could come through
Glasgow if you wanted.

1376
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:18,760
<i>- I'll meet you.</i>
- What?

1377
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,518
No. What about Badakhshan?

1378
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:22,113
Badakhshan, that will keep

1379
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:24,668
because the fucking pass
is still snowed in.

1380
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:27,513
I need that story.
I need a hit, all right?

1381
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,716
I need something
so that Geri doesn't decide

1382
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:32,075
I'm more useful as
an ottoman in her fucking office.

1383
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:35,112
What you need, Kim,
is some time out of the bubble.

1384
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,589
<i>You'd better get ready.
I'm fucking making love to you</i>

1385
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:40,592
to bagpipe versions of Sade songs.

1386
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:44,034
Yeah, okay.

1387
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:45,917
Really? You'll meet me in Glasgow?

1388
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:49,194
Yeah, I'll meet you in Glasgow.

1389
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:50,918
<i>- I'll get the next flight.</i>
- Okay.

1390
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:53,271
- Bye.
<i>- Bye.</i>

1391
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:04,109
Hey, Antoine.

1392
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:07,078
Where have you come from?
I thought you were in Badakhshan.

1393
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:10,313
I was. Drove back overnight.

1394
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,277
Wait, what? The pass is open?

1395
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:14,237
<i>Oui.</i> For now.

1396
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:29,469
Cheers.

1397
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:52,159
Oh, Christ.

1398
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:56,235
Excuse me.

1399
01:23:58,040 --> 01:23:59,109
Kunduz near?

1400
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:00,515
Far?

1401
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:08,234
I'd like to rent a car.

1402
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:10,795
Mmm-hmm.

1403
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:15,793
Aye, thank you.

1404
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:18,354
Yeah, I get it. Thank you. Thanks a lot.

1405
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:44,312
Oh, Jesus.

1406
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:46,552
Oh, shit.

1407
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:57,915
<i>Welcome to

Oh, my God.

1413
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:25,840
Leaving a message for Susan.

1414
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:28,030
Woodward, I'm back in Kabul again.

1415
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:29,416
I'm trying to get information about

1416
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:30,736
the disappearance of Iain MacKelpie,

1417
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:32,910
so if someone at Reuters
can please call me back.

1418
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,856
Call to let me know
that you've received this message.

1419
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:36,074
Thank you.

1420
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:55,350
Who kidnaps a Scottish
freelance photographer?

1421
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:57,590
The whole point of kidnapping
is to get money, right?

1422
01:25:57,680 --> 01:25:58,874
As far as I understand,

1423
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:00,936
Iain was just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

1424
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,758
Can this half-assed country
not even do kidnapping right?

1425
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:06,832
ISAF does not think
this was an upper-tier organization.

1426
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:09,718
So these men will
probably try to sell him to someone else.

1427
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:12,951
And then there
will be some talking, you know.

1428
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:15,349
Oh, my God, Fahim.
They're gonna kill him.

1429
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,752
No, they will not, Kim,

1430
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:19,239
<i>inshallah.</i>

1431
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:24,796
Now is when you're supposed
to say "I told you so."

1432
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:35,834
Fuck!

1433
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:47,350
Ramadan has ended.
They are slaughtering lambs.

1434
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:08,429
May I speak with him?

1435
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:09,560
The general's busy.

1436
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,511
Really, General? The elliptical?

1437
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:17,837
I have bad knees.

1438
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:23,272
I'm guessing you didn't come here
for the smell of balls.

1439
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:25,316
Everybody get the fuck out!

1440
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:32,711
They believe that he may have been sold

1441
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:34,358
to another organization

1442
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:36,271
somewhere in that same region.

1443
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:42,595
That's a pretty big ask, Baker.

1444
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:46,390
There's a real-time clock on this.

1445
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,911
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

1446
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:00,756
You know, it's just a shame that

1447
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:02,671
y'all don't get credit for all these

1448
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:04,512
high-profile things that you do.

1449
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:07,068
You know, especially with
SEALs and Delta out there.

1450
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:08,496
I mean, what week
goes by that you don't see

1451
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:10,829
those assholes on TV, am I right?

1452
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:15,710
And then next time Congress
votes on a Pentagon budget

1453
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:19,475
and there's this pesky little
10% line item for the Marines,

1454
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:22,597
next thing you know,
you guys are just part of the Navy.

1455
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:24,398
Although, sir, you would look spectacular

1456
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:26,311
in one of those pretty white uniforms.

1457
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:32,513
God, you know what?

1458
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:36,029
It's just occurring to me
that, unlike JSOC,

1459
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:38,315
you guys allow reporter embeds.

1460
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:42,314
Which means that a cameraman
could go on a FORECON mission.

1461
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:45,997
Don't you think that would be
great for the Corps, sir?

1462
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:48,311
That kind of exposure?

1463
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:51,353
Pretty good for you, too.

1464
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:54,598
Look, we don't go in blind.

1465
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:57,114
We have to know what we're doing
and where we're going.

1466
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:58,599
It's the way we work.

1467
01:28:58,680 --> 01:29:01,353
We're not likely to get an address, but...

1468
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,919
When you have something concrete,

1469
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,353
come back and we'll get kinetic.

1470
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:11,912
Ugh!

1471
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:18,914
Please tell Mr. Sadiq
that his "special friend" is here.

1472
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,389
What can I get for you? Some tea?
The new PlayStation?

1473
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:23,136
No, thank you.
I just need a moment of your time.

1474
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:24,354
Ah.

1475
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:28,512
We still friends, Sadiq?

1476
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:31,672
Well, that is up to you, Kim.

1477
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:33,591
Because you once told me

1478
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:36,433
that nothing happens here
that you don't know about.

1479
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:38,590
So you must know about my friend.

1480
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:40,716
Iain MacKelpie getting kidnapped.

1481
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:41,880
I did hear about this, yes.

1482
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:43,216
Yeah, well, everybody heard about it,

1483
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:47,711
but a powerful man such as yourself
must actually know something.

1484
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:49,916
Or your friend Pacha Khan
knows something.

1485
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,274
Or his friend does.

1486
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,509
Of course.

1487
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:55,632
I could make some inquiries,
but I can only do this

1488
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:57,870
for a very special friend.

1489
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:19,393
I have a video that I think
you should watch, Sadiq.

1490
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:21,994
You push the little triangle.

1491
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:25,469
You can watch
video on the phone?

1492
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:30,389
What is this?

1493
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,911
It looks like the Attorney General

1494
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:35,917
of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan

1495
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,274
dancing in the street

1496
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:39,755
with a Western enemy of Islam

1497
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,751
at a party where alcohol was served.

1498
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:44,360
I've never touched alcohol in my life!

1499
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:46,351
Well, I'm just saying how it looks.

1500
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:56,271
It's a good idea, right?

1501
01:30:57,280 --> 01:30:59,111
It's a great idea!

1502
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:01,069
It's fucking ace!

1503
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:05,273
Good on ya, Kim!

1504
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:10,391
Let's go, load up!
Let's go, move, move, move!

1505
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:26,199
You drink Tennessee whiskey,
Miss Baker?

1506
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:28,400
Yeah.

1507
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,513
Outstanding.

1508
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:21,272
Tall Brian? What the fuck?

1509
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:36,591
Hang tight, sir.
I'm gonna get you that ride.

1510
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:38,113
Thank you.

1511
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:45,034
What happened
to the army, Dr. Brydon?

1512
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:49,439
I am the army.

1513
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:56,272
Thank you, Kim.

1514
01:33:56,360 --> 01:33:57,588
How are you?

1515
01:33:58,080 --> 01:33:59,229
I've had worse kidnappings.

1516
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:05,360
<i>MacKelpie is being
treated for minor injuries.</i>

1517
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:07,352
<i>Again, this incredible footage</i>

1518
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:09,317
<i>was produced
by our very own Kim Baker.</i>

1519
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:11,715
<i>Just incredible. Way to go, Kim!</i>

1520
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:16,429
If you want to kidnap
someone fucking twice,

1521
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:17,520
you do a Toyota.

1522
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:21,275
Fucking not as interesting as it got
when they fucking pulled out a burqa.

1523
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:22,918
It's too fucking long for me!

1524
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,656
I don't know who
the woman was it belonged to.

1525
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:26,336
I'm not fucking 6'2", right?

1526
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:29,318
I'm dragging this fucking thing along,
thinking the only consolation is,

1527
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:31,516
at least if I'm a fucking woman,

1528
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:34,319
I'm not gonna get buggered,
you know what I'm saying?

1529
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,150
So anyway, I took
a little something, actually.

1530
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:44,753
I went to the gift shop at Taliban.

1531
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:46,068
I'm afraid all I could get

1532
01:34:46,240 --> 01:34:47,753
was that.

1533
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:14,354
- It's a shame you're going.
- Hmm?

1534
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:18,638
Well, I hope at least
they're flying you first class.

1535
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:21,439
Geri doesn't like me that much.
But she does like me now,

1536
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:23,750
so while I have this juice,

1537
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:25,656
I've got to leverage it
into something better.

1538
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:26,908
Yes!

1539
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,274
Yes, wait, Iraq.

1540
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:29,998
I'll come with you.

1541
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:32,878
No, actually, Pakistan.
That's where the real shooting shit is.

1542
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:34,256
It's like the Wild West out there.

1543
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:37,158
Actually, I told Geri
that I want New York or D.C.

1544
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:43,668
No, I did.

1545
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:46,359
No, really, where are you going?

1546
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:47,839
New York or D.C.

1547
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:51,069
Why?

1548
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:54,398
You can still come with me.

1549
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:02,871
Because I think
there's plenty of good work

1550
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:04,393
to be done in the real world,

1551
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:06,516
and the Kabubble is well-established.

1552
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:09,234
Is this about me going
to Badakhshan without you?

1553
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:11,880
'Cause you would have done
exactly the same thing.

1554
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:14,155
And, hey, what, I forgive you!

1555
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:18,592
This is not about you.

1556
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:21,359
It's not about Badakhshan, or Glasgow,

1557
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:23,351
or the cottage with the chickens.

1558
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:25,595
What chickens?

1559
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:34,517
It's okay. I know you're not gonna come.

1560
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:40,960
I just have to get out of here
before it's too late.

1561
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:43,753
What do you mean?

1562
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:47,990
I started to feel like this was normal.

1563
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:52,911
You know it's not, right?

1564
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:11,878
Come to New York and get it.

1565
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:15,993
Remember, you're like a six
in Manhattan.

1566
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:50,593
How's your baby?

1567
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:52,588
Which one?

1568
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:55,111
- You have two?
- Yes.

1569
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:59,111
Irish twins.

1570
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:03,679
No, they are very good.

1571
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:06,513
The younger one, the boy,
he's very strong.

1572
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:07,908
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

1573
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:10,271
I bet the girl is strong, too.

1574
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:11,713
She's stronger.

1575
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:42,718
So, um,

1576
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:46,709
those men in the hospital, the addicts...

1577
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:50,476
Any of them ever get better?

1578
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:53,233
Have a happy ending?

1579
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:07,832
In my culture, we would hug.

1580
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:33,749
Hey.

1581
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,831
<i>You know,
I miss it. The Stan.</i>

1582
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:38,839
Yeah, I miss it, too.

1583
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:40,990
Actually, I tried to go back

1584
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:43,678
but even the Army wouldn't take me.

1585
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:47,397
I mean, the Army!
I mean, that's just hurtful.

1586
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:53,433
Well, I'm very sorry
for what happened to you.

1587
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:56,353
So if there's anything
that you want to say to me,

1588
01:40:56,440 --> 01:40:57,440
that's why I'm here.

1589
01:40:57,800 --> 01:40:59,438
That's why I came here.

1590
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:00,875
Ma'am,

1591
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:06,195
I lost my legs because of an IED,
not because of you.

1592
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:10,630
I appreciate that,
but if I hadn't quoted you,

1593
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:13,029
you wouldn't have been transferred.

1594
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:14,976
No, really, you can say
whatever you want to me.

1595
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,035
That's why I'm here.

1596
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:17,496
Okay, well, then let's say you're right.

1597
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:18,960
It's still not 'cause of you, ma'am.

1598
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:23,238
Some 12-year-old haji
had to plant that bomb.

1599
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:26,118
And, hell, you know,
if Bin Laden's parents

1600
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:27,474
hadn't have gotten divorced,

1601
01:41:27,560 --> 01:41:30,472
maybe none of us would've been
in the Stan to begin with.

1602
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:35,949
And the Taliban, they wouldn't
have even been there for UBL

1603
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:38,679
if Brezhnev hadn't have gone
and fouled up Afghanistan

1604
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:40,239
in the first place.

1605
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:44,755
And the British Empire. Yeah.

1606
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:45,989
And Kim Baker.

1607
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:47,559
Okay, I deserve that.

1608
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:51,109
Goddamn!
Once you got no legs,

1609
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:53,031
everyone takes
everything so serious.

1610
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:58,188
I mean, there's only so much
any of us have any control of,

1611
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:01,514
good or bad.

1612
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:04,751
If you didn't learn that in Afghanistan,
you were not paying attention.

1613
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:07,070
So, you're not gonna yell at me?

1614
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:09,469
I mean, ma'am...

1615
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:13,032
Kim, you've got to move on.

1616
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:16,590
You're giving yourself
way too much credit.

1617
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:19,271
You embrace the suck,

1618
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:22,431
you move the fuck forward.

1619
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:30,790
What other fucking choice do we have?

1620
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:36,120
Do I hear swearing over there?

1621
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:39,394
How are you standing there
the one time I curse?

1622
01:42:39,480 --> 01:42:40,515
- "One time."
- I mean...

1623
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:41,715
It's true. He had a good

1624
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:42,856
long run in the military.

1625
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:44,518
Don't cover up for him.

1626
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:46,456
So, Kim, are you gonna stay for dinner?

1627
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:48,232
Of course she will.

1628
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:10,309
Bye!

1629
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:14,437
- Say bye to Kim. Bye, Kim!
- Say bye.

1630
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:37,034
<i>Colonel, the Afghan
National Army missed</i>

1631
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:38,640

1633
