1
00:01:04,816 --> 00:01:06,442
That was a bomb.

2
00:01:11,698 --> 00:01:14,659
No word as to whether it was an IED
or a specific car bomb.

3
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:17,912
Over 10 fatalities reported.

4
00:01:17,996 --> 00:01:23,084
Sources within ISAF suggest
that ISI may be involved.

5
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:26,754
Did these phones just go down
or did that fucker hang up on me?

6
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:32,260
Good thing that X was bodgy
or I'd be flying right now!

7
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:40,101
I can't hear you, honey.

8
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:43,187
I need to talk to Ed Faber.

9
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:47,984
Well, then who is fronting the show?

10
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:49,444
I can't hear you!

11
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:52,363
Hey, that's my ass!
Do you have a mother?

12
00:01:52,655 --> 00:01:54,365
Don't put your ass on my hand!

13
00:01:54,449 --> 00:01:56,701
Shut up, donkey pussy!

14
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:58,411
Whore! Dog-washer!

15
00:01:58,536 --> 00:01:59,871
My cock in your ear!

16
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:01,205
My cock in your ear!
I shit on your lips!

17
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:02,832
Eat a fart!

18
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:04,125
Hello!

19
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:05,209
Fu...

20
00:02:19,766 --> 00:02:23,478
<i>Listen up. Iraq Two is happening.</i>

21
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:26,397
The network is stretched thin.
All our talent is going there.

22
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:29,817
We need people, any people,
to fill the void in Afghanistan.

23
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:32,904
And you folks here
are all the unmarried,

24
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:34,947
childless personnel in this bureau.

25
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:43,164
For those of you who are
behind the scenes, there are

26
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:46,376
opportunities to be on camera.

27
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:49,504
Kim, are you going to be joining in?

28
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:51,756
The travel or the crying?

29
00:02:52,674 --> 00:02:55,176
Hopefully, the travel.

30
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:56,886
I'll think about it.

31
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:59,013
<i>The success of Operation Mongoose</i>

32
00:02:59,097 --> 00:03:01,724
<i>has overshadowed
the real lesson to be learned,</i>

33
00:03:01,808 --> 00:03:05,019
<i>that the Taliban are
far from vanquished.</i>

34
00:03:05,103 --> 00:03:06,187
<i>And as the drums of war</i>

35
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,855
<i>beat ever louder in Iraq,</i>

36
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:12,318
<i>the NATO mission in Afghanistan
grows increasingly uncertain.</i>

37
00:03:16,406 --> 00:03:19,242
<i>Tanya Vanderpoel, outside
Lashkar Gah, Afghanistan,</i>

38
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:20,952
<i>VBC World News.</i>

39
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:24,956
<i>Hey-</i>

40
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:27,333
I got you! Hey.

41
00:03:27,417 --> 00:03:30,002
When do you get back from Houston?

42
00:03:30,086 --> 00:03:32,338
<i>I think on Tuesday. Why'?</i>

43
00:03:32,422 --> 00:03:36,509
Because I'm going
to Afghanistan on Tuesday.

44
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:39,554
<i>You're going
to Afghanistan on Tuesday'?</i>

45
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:40,888
Yeah.

46
00:03:40,972 --> 00:03:42,849
<i>But you write news copy.</i>

47
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:44,350
<i>Wait. For how long?</i>

48
00:03:44,434 --> 00:03:47,311
- Like, three months.
- What?

49
00:03:53,151 --> 00:03:54,318
Kim!

50
00:03:55,987 --> 00:03:57,155
Hey!

51
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:00,408
I can't believe this worked out!

52
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,828
Hey, you want to have a quickie
on the changing table in the bathroom?

53
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:07,331
Yeah, I don't think I could get it up
with that little koala looking at me.

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,585
Also, they're boarding already.

55
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:12,253
Hey, don't worry. Just go. Go, go, go.

56
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:15,631
Shoot, I... I copied a key for you, so...

57
00:04:15,715 --> 00:04:16,883
Plants, mail.

58
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:18,760
- Anything else I'm forgetting?
- I think that's it.

59
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:20,595
This is crazy.

60
00:04:20,678 --> 00:04:22,472
Listen, I think it's impressive.

61
00:04:22,555 --> 00:04:23,806
Start a new career?

62
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,266
It's gonna be great.

63
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:27,935
And listen, in three months...

64
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:29,353
<i>"I'll</i> be back."

65
00:04:29,437 --> 00:04:30,772
No, that's terrible! No.

66
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:32,815
Don't remember me like that. No.

67
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:36,027
Bye. Okay. Okay.

68
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:41,282
It's not my job. I'm a producer.

69
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:42,825
General news. Enron.

70
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:45,953
These coalminers in Pennsylvania,
but you probably didn't see that.

71
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:47,622
'Cause we got two wars going on now,

72
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:50,124
so, I know how to set up a BGAN

73
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,876
and no one will sue if I die

74
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,797
so I got an expedited visa,
like, two days ago,

75
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,716
and I guess now I'm a war reporter.

76
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:02,512
Shit dick!

77
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,223
Corkscrew landing.

78
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:08,434
In case a missile is fired at the aircraft!

79
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,773
Kabul International Airport.

80
00:05:13,898 --> 00:05:16,275
K.l.A.! "Killed In Action."

81
00:05:17,193 --> 00:05:20,279
<i>Once again,
we thank you for flying with us.</i>

82
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:31,958
Sorry.

83
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:33,793
Sorry.

84
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:35,461
Shit.

85
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:40,842
No, thank you. No, thank you.

86
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:44,929
Miss Baker?

87
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:47,098
I am Fahim.

88
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:50,518
Fahim, hi! Pleased to meet you.

89
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:52,144
The car is over here and we go.

90
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,356
Cover your head, shameless whore!

91
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:58,442
She says... "Welcome to Afghanistan."

92
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,361
Okay, let's go.

93
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:03,656
Here is your local mobile.
The number is on the back.

94
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:05,533
Yeah, I ordered some money
last week. Still in the post.

95
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:07,285
- I'll fix you up next week.
- Okay.

96
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:11,163
Yes, the air here
takes some getting used to.

97
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:13,124
It's quite polluted with feces.

98
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,376
Here she is! How are you, Kim?

99
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:17,378
Welcome to the Stan. My name's Nic.

100
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:18,880
I'll be doing your security.
I'll take your bag.

101
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:21,591
Fahim. The police are giving
me shit for parking here.

102
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:23,885
They just want money.

103
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:28,055
Wait, oh, no. Do you need money?
Because the network gave me money.

104
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:30,266
- No, keep that on you!
- No, no, no! Kim, please!

105
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,608
Piss off, that's it! That's it! Hey! Hey!

106
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:41,694
- I'm sorry. Sorry.
- Piss off!

107
00:06:54,707 --> 00:06:56,792
Remember that we are at altitude here,

108
00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:59,170
so drink plenty of water
while you acclimatize.

109
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:00,922
Where did you learn English?

110
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:03,341
At medical school. I was a doctor.

111
00:07:03,758 --> 00:07:05,635
Listen, rest up tonight.

112
00:07:05,718 --> 00:07:08,179
Tomorrow, I'll drive you
to the base for your embed.

113
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,350
And just one bag, but make sure
you pack extra socks and knickers.

114
00:07:12,642 --> 00:07:15,519
That's like, it's like "panties," yeah?

115
00:07:18,648 --> 00:07:20,816
So, you've been
embedded before, then?

116
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,278
Not really. We all did
hostile-zone training in 2001.

117
00:07:24,362 --> 00:07:27,406
They taught us to open our
mouths if we get mortared...

118
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:29,450
That kind of stuff.

119
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:31,452
Okay.

120
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:42,421
<i>G' day , Qadar.</i>

121
00:07:54,976 --> 00:07:57,561
The feces smell all the way to here.

122
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,320
Your room, Kim, is upstairs.

123
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:13,411
Yeah, they're bloody addicted.

124
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:15,663
That one melted a laptop
downloading porno.

125
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:17,498
Jaweed, yes,

126
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,792
he likes to watch men with donkeys.

127
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,419
- Hi.
- Hi.

128
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:23,337
It's unfortunate.

129
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:25,589
Kim, this is Tail Brian.

130
00:08:25,715 --> 00:08:26,882
Brian Hooper. Tall Brian.

131
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:28,009
- Hi.
- I'm your shooter.

132
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:31,971
So, is there another Brian around here
somewhere that you're taller than?

133
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:34,598
Short Brian. Works for Reuters.

134
00:08:34,974 --> 00:08:37,143
Couldn't one of you just be "Brian"?

135
00:08:37,977 --> 00:08:40,271
Fair enough. Didn't think of that.

136
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:41,939
Also Short Brian's dead.

137
00:08:42,398 --> 00:08:44,817
- Fuck. Really?
- Yes.

138
00:08:45,735 --> 00:08:48,571
Anyway, welcome to the Fun House.

139
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:57,538
Home sweet home.

140
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:00,166
This is your room.

141
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:04,128
Is there a shower?

142
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:35,076
<i>A nation accustomed to war</i>

143
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:38,037
<i>once again seeks a return to normality.</i>

144
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:42,374
<i>And nothing symbolizes that
effort more than this place,</i>

145
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:44,794
<i>the Kabul Zoo.</i>

146
00:09:44,877 --> 00:09:46,670
No, he didn't. The zoo?

147
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:49,465
- Go back to Wapping.
- You fucking tourist!

148
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:53,469
Shit. Sorry.
I'm trying to find the shower?

149
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:54,887
You're the new girl.

150
00:09:55,513 --> 00:09:58,140
My God. Kim Baker.

151
00:09:58,224 --> 00:10:00,017
Just got here from New York.

152
00:10:00,101 --> 00:10:01,769
I'm Tanya. Oh, my God,

153
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:04,188
it's so nice to have another
woman in the house!

154
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,565
I love that lippy color. What is that?

155
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:07,942
No, they're just really chapped.

156
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:11,112
You poor thing. Can I get you anything?

157
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:15,157
I'm sorry, I'm freaking out
because I saw your

158
00:10:15,241 --> 00:10:18,577
special about your embed in
Korengal, and it was amazing.

159
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:20,913
Thank you. That's so sweet.

160
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:23,415
- Where's the shower?
- Yes. This way.

161
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:27,044
Can I ask a favor, Kim?

162
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:29,421
- And absolutely feel free to say no.
- Yeah, sure.

163
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:30,714
I hate to even bring it up.

164
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:33,175
- I feel so rude even asking this.
- No, it's fine.

165
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:35,803
Can I fuck your security guys?

166
00:10:36,095 --> 00:10:37,930
What?

167
00:10:38,848 --> 00:10:40,516
By all means, yeah.

168
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:41,642
Yeah? I mean, I wouldn't ask,

169
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,602
it's just that for some reason,

170
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:45,855
the VBC use an American contractor

171
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:47,898
and, I mean, no offense,
but they're all, like,

172
00:10:47,982 --> 00:10:49,817
goatees and "fat-strong".

173
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,236
You know? But the Aussies
and Kiwis are <i>so</i> hot.

174
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,321
Right. I get it. Be my guest.

175
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:56,031
You sure? Don't just
say that to be polite.

176
00:10:56,115 --> 00:10:57,366
No, I wouldn't. I'm not.

177
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,660
Even Nic? You don't want
Nic for yourself?

178
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,328
<i>We?</i>

179
00:11:01,412 --> 00:11:03,914
No.ldonW.No.

180
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,292
That's... No, that would never happen.
So you're good.

181
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:10,129
Hey! No, Kim, don't say that.
You could have Nic.

182
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:13,299
In Afghanistan,
you're a serious piece of ass.

183
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:14,967
Thank you. That's nice.

184
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,552
Because you're what,
I mean, you're like,

185
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:19,555
a seven, a six or seven in New York?

186
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:22,308
Here, you're a nine.

187
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:24,435
Borderline ten.

188
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:26,103
It's called "Kabul Cute."

189
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:29,815
What are you here, like a 15?

190
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:32,610
Yeah.

191
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:37,948
The thing is, I have a very
serious boyfriend at home,

192
00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:39,575
so, you're good.

193
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:40,951
All right, well, come talk
to me in two months

194
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:43,704
when your pussy's eating your leg.
Shower's that way.

195
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:54,924
<i>How you doing?</i>

196
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,509
It's bananas here. It's...

197
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:01,305
My nose is running.
There's shit in the air,

198
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:02,765
literally.

199
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:04,016
And

200
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:06,644
I don't think I can do this.

201
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:08,187
<i>Do what?</i>

202
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:09,688
<i>Kim?</i>

203
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:12,483
I don't think I can do this.

204
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:14,568
<i>Can you see... I don't... Hello?</i>

205
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:16,737
Shit.

206
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:35,881
I'm sorry, Colonel,
I can't accept gifts as a journalist.

207
00:12:35,965 --> 00:12:37,174
Okay.

208
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:38,884
So lodging, transport,

209
00:12:38,968 --> 00:12:41,470
chow and protection,
that's all you can accept?

210
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,222
I'll do my best to stay objective.

211
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:46,350
I don't care if you can do your job.
I care if my men can.

212
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:49,687
Are you familiar with the term
"four-ten-four", Miss Baker?

213
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,188
I am not, Colonel.

214
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:54,066
It refers to women
who are fours back home

215
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:56,026
become tens when they ship out

216
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:59,029
and when they're back stateside,
they become fours again.

217
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:00,572
Are you saying I'm a four?

218
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:04,410
I'm saying you carry
an orange fucking backpack.

219
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:09,331
I've seen people with actual experience
make bad decisions here.

220
00:13:09,415 --> 00:13:12,042
So while you're outside
the wire with my men,

221
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:14,461
you will in no way
distract them, understood?

222
00:13:15,713 --> 00:13:17,923
Are you asking me not
to sleep with your soldiers?

223
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:20,217
No, not "soldiers". Marines.

224
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:21,468
You're not here to sleep with

225
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:24,763
or perform jobs of any type
on my Marines.

226
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,265
Clear copy, Miss Baker?

227
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:28,851
- Copy that.
- Good.

228
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:31,979
We'll get you out to a FOB
as soon as we find a ride for you.

229
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:35,232
In the meantime, Captain Stern here
will see to it that you get a wet hootch.

230
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:37,234
A what?

231
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:39,236
It's a tent with a shower.

232
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:42,614
Unless you'd prefer a dry hootch.

233
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:44,158
I would not, sir.

234
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:44,551
Sorry.

235
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:47,930
Could you just...
State your name and rank?

236
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:50,307
Gunnery Sergeant Clinton J. Hurd.

237
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:52,976
All right. Dang it!

238
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:57,398
So, do you believe the Afghani people
are happy about our presence here?

239
00:14:57,648 --> 00:14:59,400
No, Afghans are the people.

240
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:02,736
Afghanis is the currency.

241
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,613
That's right. I knew that. Thank you.

242
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,740
What do you believe
your mission to be here?

243
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:08,158
Ma'am, you got a sticker on your pants.

244
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:10,327
It's bugging the shit out of me. Ma'am...

245
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:12,413
Fahim.

246
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:14,331
What inspired you to enlist originally?

247
00:15:14,415 --> 00:15:19,169
I'm a big fan of the movie Predator
with Arnold Schwarzenegger.

248
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:20,629
We're the same height.

249
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:24,758
Do you think the war in Iraq
has affected your resources here?

250
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:27,594
I'm sorry, ma'am, I'm not authorized
to answer that question.

251
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:32,474
I'd say we're both on the
wrong side of Persia, ma'am.

252
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:33,934
Iraq is where you get some right now.

253
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:35,185
Here just has shit all.

254
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:37,896
Are you guys getting
outside the wire much?

255
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,023
Yes, ma'am. Most days.

256
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:42,776
You know, we help out with
community projects and all.

257
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,987
And wells.

258
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:48,490
And sometimes at night
we shoot the big gun,

259
00:15:48,574 --> 00:15:50,617
-but, you know, it's quiet here.
- Jesus!

260
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:53,120
We don't wear IBAs on the FOB.

261
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:56,123
I don't even chamber a round
in my weapon anymore, because,

262
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:59,877
you know, I figure accidental discharge
is scarier than the Taliban.

263
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,464
With Iraq, do you feel like people
have forgotten about Afghanistan?

264
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:05,215
Well...

265
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:08,135
Yes, ma'am. I'd say that
surely is the word for it.

266
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,805
This here's a forgotten war.

267
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:14,475
It's capital F, capital W.

268
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:17,311
What's your... Your name and rank?

269
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:21,815
I'm Lance Corporal Coughlin,
India Company 3-5.

270
00:16:23,484 --> 00:16:24,485
Thank you.

271
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:33,327
Kim. Your hair.

272
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:37,289
Thanks, Fahim.

273
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:40,417
You really are a fixer.

274
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:46,673
Moon's out.

275
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,011
It's beautiful.

276
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,395
Suck my dick!

277
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:02,856
What does that mean?

278
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,276
It means, "What a terrible event!"

279
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:07,444
Miss Baker.

280
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:09,363
Colonel Hollanek is coming
to Norton tomorrow

281
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:10,948
to check on some of our PRT work.

282
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,116
And you and your crew
are clear to tag along.

283
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,869
- Great, thanks.
- Rolls out at zero-six.

284
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:18,956
- That's 6:00 a.m.
- I know that, yeah.

285
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:21,208
Fire!

286
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:25,337
Come on, let's go!
Get this shit together! We gotta move!

287
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,214
Fucking hands out of your pockets!

288
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:28,799
You think you're in the fucking Army?

289
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:33,220
What is this?

290
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:34,888
That's my supplies. Camera stuff.

291
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:36,723
You fucking kidding me?

292
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:40,769
This is an orange ruck.
No, ma'am. Not on my vehicle.

293
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:44,273
The girl at the North Face store
said it was, like, military grade.

294
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:46,942
Well, where are you gonna hide it?
Inside a fucking sunset?

295
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:50,404
I mean, even the Dutch Army
don't wear orange.

296
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:51,822
Fix it.

297
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,616
How do I fix it?

298
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,867
Rapono!

299
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:14,428
Got to stay hydrated, ma'am.

300
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:16,722
Coughlin. I didn't recognize you.

301
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:19,349
That's 'cause I'm in warrior mode.

302
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:21,184
It makes me taller.

303
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:24,855
Enjoy the ride, ma'am.

304
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:51,757
I'm dying to know who blew up my well.

305
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,175
Working on it, Colonel.

306
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:56,261
That was a nice fucking well, Corporal.

307
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:02,059
What'd he say?

308
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:08,065
What's that mean?

309
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:10,067
He wants to know
if you are the Russians.

310
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:13,070
<i>The Russians?</i>

311
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:15,781
No!

312
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:18,325
No, sir. That was 20 years ago.

313
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:19,743
And we're here to help.

314
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,789
And I'm black.

315
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,752
<i>The Russians are</i> blacks <i>now.</i>

316
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,633
If we fix the well, you can't blow it up.

317
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:39,012
Kim, I was talking to some
of the younger men.

318
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:41,348
They say the Taliban came at night.

319
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,767
I don't care. No. I drank
too much water and I have to pee.

320
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:46,770
Stop. Stop. I am engaged to be married.

321
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:50,023
Okay, Fahim,
I know you like your women to be, like,

322
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:52,401
beautiful, mysterious IKEA bags, okay?

323
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:55,570
But we urinate, Doctor.
Out of our vaginas.

324
00:19:57,072 --> 00:19:58,573
You think you urinate out the...

325
00:19:58,657 --> 00:20:00,033
No. I know it's a separate thing!

326
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:01,368
God! Just please help me.

327
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:03,286
There is nowhere for you to go.

328
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,080
I cannot ask these men about this.

329
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:06,707
And I'm not allowed
to talk to the women.

330
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,960
Fine. Forget it. I'll hold it.
Women are tough, right?

331
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:20,345
Are you okay, ma'am?

332
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:23,849
Gosh, damn it, man.
This is a new one.

333
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:27,728
I was cursing your name at 0-stupid-30,
but I'm glad I came out today.

334
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:31,773
Would you not have gone
on patrol today if I weren't here?

335
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:33,859
No, I'd be back in Norton
filling HESCOs.

336
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:35,152
Copy that.

337
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:38,280
We're still 5 mikes.
It must be one hairy dump.

338
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:40,657
No, I'm just getting my pants on.
Damn it, Sergeant Hurd.

339
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:41,992
Whatever.

340
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:44,327
- Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
- Marine!

341
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:46,079
Make a hole, Baker.

342
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:53,587
Move out!

343
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,660
Why are we stopping?

344
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:27,412
The lead vehicle bottomed out.

345
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:30,457
Okay! Heads on a swivel!

346
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,043
Didn't we come this way?

347
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:35,462
We most surely did.

348
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:41,551
- Contact left!
- Stay in the vehicle!

349
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:48,350
Shit! Hot! Hot bullet things!

350
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:55,607
Kim, don't get out of the car! Kim!

351
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,491
Get down behind the engine block!

352
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:06,368
Stay there! Stay there!

353
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:09,162
Kim.

354
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:10,580
Get back in the car!

355
00:22:21,216 --> 00:22:23,260
No, please, Kim!

356
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:40,443
Ma'am, I asked you to stay put!

357
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:41,987
<i>Those assholes tried to</i> shoot <i>us!</i>

358
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:44,739
<i>Jesus).!</i>

359
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:46,867
You have got to be shitting me!

360
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,161
You just shot a Javelin at a fucking car!

361
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:52,622
That's an $80,000 piece of ordnance!

362
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:55,792
Can any of you geniuses
tell me the Kelley Blue Book value

363
00:22:55,876 --> 00:22:58,712
of a 1989 Toyota pickup?

364
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:13,143
Oorah, Baker. Get some.

365
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:20,692
I hope you got all that on film, ma'am.

366
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:22,903
'Cause that right there,
that's what we do best.

367
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:24,404
Hearts and minds.

368
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:27,324
That's the two best places
to shoot somebody.

369
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:32,495
What?

370
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:34,247
I told you to stay in the car.

371
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:36,291
Okay, I'll get back in the car.

372
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,668
<i>The Marines don't have
much to say about Iraq.</i>

373
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:43,465
<i>Their mantra is that they are
focused on doing the job here.</i>

374
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:45,592
<i>And even though, as we saw firsthand,</i>

375
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:48,929
<i>attacks against coalition forces are up,</i>

376
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:52,140
<i>Corporal Coughlin told me earlier
that he is still not planning</i>

377
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:55,560
<i>to lock and load his weapon
when he is out on patrol.</i>

378
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:58,063
<i>Our own Kim Baker reporting for us live.</i>

379
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:03,193
Welcome!

380
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:08,365
Wow, good job, Kim! Ruthless!

381
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:13,912
Bitch, we are going out tonight!

382
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:43,233
It's okay. It's okay. Here.

383
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:49,114
It's okay. It's all right.

384
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:00,208
Why don't I know who you are?

385
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:04,796
You're what, like, 42?

386
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:05,880
Sold.

387
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:07,298
Why have I never heard of you?

388
00:25:07,382 --> 00:25:10,760
Yeah, I haven't done
a lot of overseas reporting.

389
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:14,055
I've done mostly domestic reportage.

390
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,433
<i>UReportagenr?</i>

391
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:19,352
<i>Domestic reportage.</i>

392
00:25:19,644 --> 00:25:22,772
Look, everyone in the Kabubble
is full of shit. It's okay.

393
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:24,024
Half the accents are fake.

394
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:28,111
The whole "I'm ex-Special Forces"
wankers are flat out lying.

395
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:29,738
<i>UReportagenr?</i>

396
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:34,993
Oh, Christ, what is this?

397
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:36,786
I really shouldn't have
my back to the door.

398
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,371
It's bad tradecraft,

399
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:41,082
but it's worth it to talk to you two ladies.

400
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:44,085
Fuck off.

401
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:45,754
You got it.

402
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:49,299
Champagne?

403
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:50,800
Thank you.

404
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:52,135
Finish this,

405
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:54,471
and then we'll go meet some friends
in Wazir Akbar Khan.

406
00:25:54,554 --> 00:25:57,265
And I am warning you now,
do not sleep with lain.

407
00:25:57,348 --> 00:25:59,309
- Who is lain?
- He's a proper asshole.

408
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:01,394
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

409
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,063
Is that a cab?

410
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:09,569
Is your full name Shakira?

411
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:12,030
'Cause I thought it was
a Colombian nickname.

412
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:13,239
Why would you think that?

413
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:14,407
Because of the singer.

414
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:18,995
No, I know. I'm kidding.
No, it's Arabic for "thankful."

415
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,914
Kim is American for "white lady".

416
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:24,542
Actually, "Kim" means "who" in Turkish.

417
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:26,211
"Who's that white lady?"

418
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:27,712
It's Kim.

419
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:30,298
That's so you can remember my name.

420
00:26:30,465 --> 00:26:33,093
So... This is lain. lain, Kim.

421
00:26:34,552 --> 00:26:37,972
Kim. Kim. Kim. Kim, nice work.

422
00:26:38,306 --> 00:26:41,142
You sit next to the only two women
in a country the size of Texas

423
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:43,436
that remind a man that you're
really only okay looking.

424
00:26:44,813 --> 00:26:47,273
Well, she said
you were an asshole,

425
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:48,608
but that's really above and beyond.

426
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:49,776
- Who said that?
- Tanya.

427
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:51,236
No. No. No. I don't think so.

428
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:53,113
A lot of women
find me very charming, Kim.

429
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:55,824
- No, not biological women.
- Oh, really?

430
00:26:55,907 --> 00:26:57,242
Women who think that an accent

431
00:26:57,325 --> 00:26:59,911
is the same thing
as a personality, maybe.

432
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:03,540
<i>Nae, haud yer wheesht.
Go bile yer heid, ya wee bampot.</i>

433
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:08,002
I bet you're wetter than a submarine
with screen doors now.

434
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:11,131
I got that from a pickup book.

435
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:12,674
- Jesus.
- Oh, yeah.

436
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:15,426
So what's your deal?

437
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,053
You got chucked over by some guy

438
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:18,763
so you think, "Forget him.

439
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:20,849
"I'm gonna go discover
the wonders of the East,

440
00:27:20,932 --> 00:27:23,226
"and I'm gonna fuck a Scottish guy
and write a book."

441
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:24,936
I'm Scottish, by the way.

442
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:30,358
Cheers.

443
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:31,860
Cheers.

444
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:37,907
<i>- Cheers.
- Salud.</i>

445
00:27:37,991 --> 00:27:39,826
- Cheers.
- To Kim!

446
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,331
- Is this your first night out?
- Yes.

447
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,125
It is, actually.

448
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,462
That little bastard!

449
00:27:51,546 --> 00:27:52,547
Oh, no, Kim.

450
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:55,258
You didn't give Egg Boy
money, did you?

451
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,345
Hey! Egg Boy! Hey!
You're a little shitbird!

452
00:28:00,555 --> 00:28:02,223
I hope you get salmonella!

453
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:06,144
I gave him, like, $100!

454
00:28:06,227 --> 00:28:07,687
-$100?
- What?

455
00:28:08,146 --> 00:28:10,690
I'd give you my eggs for $100.

456
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:13,026
Where are we going?

457
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:15,612
A whorehouse. You're going to love it.

458
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:20,283
You see that?

459
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:23,286
It's a brothel and a Chinese restaurant.

460
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:37,759
Do you remember this video?

461
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:41,304
Everybody was drawings.

462
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:46,809
Me? Oh, no, thank you.

463
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,855
Look, a month ago,
I was writing a story about corn syrup.

464
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:52,732
Okay? I was not happy.

465
00:28:52,815 --> 00:28:55,193
I didn't think there was anything else
out there for me.

466
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:56,653
Just death.

467
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:57,820
Then this came along and...

468
00:28:57,904 --> 00:28:59,614
I don't care

469
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:03,368
Wenge, do you guys have
regular access to healthcare?

470
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,421
He called me a Fenian bastard.

471
00:29:15,505 --> 00:29:18,841
I fuckin' showed him what for,
kicked his teeth in, the cunt.

472
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:22,178
Oi, Tanya? What's her story?

473
00:29:22,262 --> 00:29:26,599
She has a boyfriend.
And she's unconscious, okay?

474
00:29:26,683 --> 00:29:29,143
Not that either of those things
have ever stopped you before.

475
00:29:29,227 --> 00:29:31,104
That's not true. That's not true.

476
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:32,563
Firstly, I'm afraid of boyfriends.

477
00:29:33,314 --> 00:29:35,358
Secondly, I'm a gentleman.

478
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:40,613
What? According to no less
an authority than Grace Mugabe.

479
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:42,198
I held a door open for her once.

480
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:44,492
Let me just have a little peekaboo.

481
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:45,868
Get out!

482
00:29:45,952 --> 00:29:47,745
Actually, not bad.

483
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:50,957
- I think I missed one.
- Stop!

484
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:54,294
<i>H y a du monde au balcon. Pas mal.</i>

485
00:29:54,377 --> 00:29:55,545
Kim?

486
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:57,046
You all right there, mate?

487
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,631
Wouldn't you like to know?

488
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:00,383
Hey. I'm just talking about her safety.

489
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:04,053
Nic here does security for Kim, lain.

490
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:13,062
Right, well!

491
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:16,274
I'm off. Excuse me.

492
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:17,650
- Excused.
- Good night.

493
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:19,736
- Bye, darling!
- Good night.

494
00:30:22,447 --> 00:30:24,490
The best, Nic!

495
00:30:36,002 --> 00:30:39,005
Oh, that's Oprah.

496
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:52,268
Hello.

497
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:54,854
It's Fahim. Are you ready to go?

498
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:57,857
Go where, dude? It's Saturday.

499
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,318
Friday is the only day off
in the Islamic week.

500
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:01,819
We have interviews.

501
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:03,696
No! That was not made clear.
That's... No.

502
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,782
That's bullshit, Fahim. No.

503
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:08,618
Kim, today we are meeting
Ali Massoud Sadiq.

504
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:11,454
<i>I sent research.
He's likely to be Attorney General.</i>

505
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,879
- Please hold.
- Please come outside.

506
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:23,174
This is against what I believe
as an American.

507
00:31:23,257 --> 00:31:25,259
I am sorry, but we have to go.

508
00:31:25,343 --> 00:31:27,136
<i>My shoes. Shit.</i>

509
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,722
You wish to interview me,
Mr. Ahmadzai?

510
00:31:30,223 --> 00:31:33,142
I do, Mr. Sadiq. Yes, on camera.

511
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,311
Mr. Ahmadzai,

512
00:31:35,395 --> 00:31:37,397
lam a person of,

513
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,732
Of no consequence.

514
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:41,067
Well, you soon might be

515
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:43,611
the second most powerful
person in Afghanistan.

516
00:31:43,694 --> 00:31:44,862
Mr. Ahmadzai,

517
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:48,241
I run a small department
inside the Interior Ministry.

518
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:51,452
What possible interest
could I be to the Americans?

519
00:31:51,536 --> 00:31:55,039
Because your Ministry
for the Prevention of Vice

520
00:31:55,164 --> 00:31:56,999
and the Encouragement of Virtue

521
00:31:57,083 --> 00:32:01,212
sounds a lot like the Taliban's old
Ministry of Vice and Virtue.

522
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:05,216
Don't you think?

523
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,935
Kim Baker.

524
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:22,233
When the Taliban was in power,

525
00:32:22,316 --> 00:32:24,944
they enforced their version of sharia.

526
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:26,320
One of their edicts was a rule that

527
00:32:26,404 --> 00:32:29,031
all men must shave
the hair of their pubis.

528
00:32:29,157 --> 00:32:32,910
They would walk the streets
carrying a small wooden rod,

529
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:34,662
a dowel,

530
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:38,040
which they would roll along
the front of a man's trousers.

531
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:42,378
If a man's pubic hair was long enough
to curl around the dowel,

532
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,715
they would beat him.

533
00:32:46,883 --> 00:32:47,967
Now, I ask you,

534
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:51,387
do I look like a man to walk the streets

535
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:54,140
carrying a hair-of-the-pubis dowel?

536
00:32:55,308 --> 00:32:56,893
No, sir, you do not.

537
00:32:58,227 --> 00:33:02,231
I returned to this country to save it.

538
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:04,609
I am a friend of America.

539
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:06,152
Which is why you should let me
interview you,

540
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:08,404
so people can understand that.

541
00:33:10,198 --> 00:33:11,657
I like you, Kim.

542
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:13,743
I like your mouthiness.

543
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:15,536
That is a word, yes?

544
00:33:16,913 --> 00:33:19,540
It reminds me of my time
living in London.

545
00:33:19,624 --> 00:33:22,376
You make me feel like
a young man again.

546
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:25,963
But I do not know you.

547
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:31,219
How can we
get to know each other, Kim?

548
00:33:38,768 --> 00:33:40,937
Yes, excellent, Kim!

549
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:45,733
Put a turban on her,
she'd make a very handsome boy.

550
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:24,063
<i>How are you'? You okay there?</i>

551
00:34:26,107 --> 00:34:27,233
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

552
00:34:27,316 --> 00:34:29,443
It's probably just
a wedding somewhere nearby.

553
00:34:29,527 --> 00:34:31,404
They like to shoot off guns
at weddings here.

554
00:34:31,487 --> 00:34:33,030
You get it, you're from Florida.

555
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:34,615
<i>Funny.</i>

556
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:36,075
<i>When was the last time I saw you'?</i>

557
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:37,577
<i>Since June?</i>

558
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:40,162
I'm sorry that I didn't
get back last month.

559
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:43,207
I can be in New York by Thursday.

560
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:46,294
I miss you and I want to see you. And I...

561
00:34:46,377 --> 00:34:47,753
<i>Wave...</i>

562
00:34:47,837 --> 00:34:49,797
Not again.

563
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:54,927
I hate this fucking airport.

564
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:57,597
Can I bring you guys
anything from New York?

565
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,016
Just bring us back a six pack?

566
00:35:00,725 --> 00:35:02,560
- This is Kim.
- Kim Baker?

567
00:35:02,852 --> 00:35:04,687
It is Sadiq.

568
00:35:05,855 --> 00:35:07,982
Mr. Sadiq, hi.

569
00:35:08,566 --> 00:35:11,485
How about an interview
with Pacha Khan?

570
00:35:11,569 --> 00:35:13,321
Pacha Khan, the warlord?

571
00:35:13,404 --> 00:35:15,072
<i>Pacha Khan is a businessman.</i>

572
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:16,991
Would you like that?

573
00:35:17,074 --> 00:35:20,494
Yeah. Yeah. But I'm on my way
to New York to see my boyfriend.

574
00:35:20,578 --> 00:35:25,207
<i>You will be the first Western journalist
to interview him since the Soviet War.</i>

575
00:35:26,584 --> 00:35:28,419
<i>Shall we say tomorrow?</i>

576
00:35:34,258 --> 00:35:37,178
Okay, yes, of course. Thank you.

577
00:35:39,597 --> 00:35:41,015
- What?
- Back in the car.

578
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:45,061
Wait here.

579
00:35:52,068 --> 00:35:53,527
It's okay, come.

580
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:21,097
She is a Muslim?

581
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:29,730
Yes

582
00:36:31,691 --> 00:36:33,567
Have her pray for me.

583
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,453
She is Turkish.

584
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:48,833
You wouldn't understand her anyway.

585
00:36:56,966 --> 00:36:58,300
- Okay. Yes.
- Yeah?

586
00:36:58,384 --> 00:36:59,427
Okay.

587
00:37:03,556 --> 00:37:06,267
Pacha Khan, thank you
for your kind hospitality.

588
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:10,646
Put a turban on her and she
would make a handsome boy!

589
00:37:22,992 --> 00:37:24,118
What?

590
00:37:25,661 --> 00:37:26,871
No.

591
00:37:28,873 --> 00:37:31,584
- Kim. Cheers.
- Hi.

592
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:32,710
What a rush, yeah?

593
00:37:32,793 --> 00:37:36,756
Pacha Khan, yeah.
It's like, adrenaline. Everyone was...

594
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:38,215
Good job.

595
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:39,592
Yeah, it went well.

596
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:42,762
But, you know, I was... I was in the...

597
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:44,722
The New Zealand SAS back home.

598
00:37:44,889 --> 00:37:47,308
And today felt like
jumping out of an airplane.

599
00:37:47,725 --> 00:37:50,770
Or like, you know, like having sex.

600
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:56,567
Kim!

601
00:37:58,068 --> 00:38:00,738
Tanya's got scotch.
It won't last long, so...

602
00:38:01,572 --> 00:38:04,742
Nic, you're welcome, too, you big cunt!

603
00:38:04,867 --> 00:38:08,120
That's a term of affection, by the way.

604
00:38:09,705 --> 00:38:13,876
You were supposed to be
in New York, sneaky girl.

605
00:38:14,001 --> 00:38:17,046
Yeah, Chris is not super pleased.

606
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:19,465
Chris can suck a fat one.

607
00:38:21,592 --> 00:38:25,805
I'm trying to see if they put my story up,
but this Internet connection is the worst!

608
00:38:26,806 --> 00:38:29,225
- Goddamn it, Jaweed!
- Christ!

609
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:31,143
Really?

610
00:38:31,227 --> 00:38:33,813
Although, donkeys aside,
he's a good fixer.

611
00:38:35,064 --> 00:38:38,442
No, thanks. Morning shows.

612
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:41,028
You have something
they want for the mornings?

613
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:45,407
Maybe. I don't know. Maybe.

614
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:48,410
That's what I'm trying to see.

615
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,998
You know, I heard
that he has contacts in the Tribals.

616
00:38:53,082 --> 00:38:55,876
Like real Taliban contacts.

617
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,045
- Jaweed?
- Jaweed.

618
00:38:58,379 --> 00:39:00,881
- No fucking way.
- Apparently.

619
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:03,926
Would you do that?
Would you go down there?

620
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:10,266
Yeah, sure, if it was the right call.

621
00:39:10,933 --> 00:39:12,768
Yeah, but how do you know
if it's the right call?

622
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,357
Fuck, man, I don't know.

623
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,526
That is why we drink, do drugs

624
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:23,070
and shag strangers
in restaurant bathrooms.

625
00:39:45,301 --> 00:39:46,468
<i>Kim, are you okay'? What's going on'?</i>

626
00:39:46,552 --> 00:39:48,596
Oh, shoot. Sorry, what time is it?

627
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:50,264
<i>I don't know. I'm in Seattle.</i>

628
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:52,391
<i>God, I thought you got shot
at a wedding or something.</i>

629
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:53,517
<i>- Jesus, Kim!
- No.</i>

630
00:39:53,642 --> 00:39:55,561
Sorry. So, just real quick...

631
00:39:55,644 --> 00:39:58,188
- I <i>want you to come</i> visit <i>me.
- In Afghanistan? Really?</i>

632
00:39:58,314 --> 00:39:59,273
I mean, I've got tons of miles.

633
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:00,357
I could fly you first class.

634
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:02,610
<i>I have to look at a calendar.
I don't think I can do it this month.</i>

635
00:40:02,693 --> 00:40:03,819
<i>I'm here until, like, at least the 15th.</i>

636
00:40:03,903 --> 00:40:05,029
<i>But when I get back maybe...</i>

637
00:40:05,112 --> 00:40:07,114
- Who is in your bed, Chris?
- What?

638
00:40:08,157 --> 00:40:09,742
<i>No, that's my bag.</i>

639
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:11,994
Look in the mirror, dipshit.

640
00:40:13,913 --> 00:40:16,749
My God. You motherfucker.
Unbelievable. Unbelievable!

641
00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:18,167
<i>You calm the fuck down!</i>

642
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,002
<i>Listen, you haven't
been home in months.</i>

643
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:21,253
<i>You forgot my fucking birthday!</i>

644
00:40:21,337 --> 00:40:22,922
Right, it's my fault.
Great, Chris. You're a genius.

645
00:40:23,005 --> 00:40:25,215
<i>And I kept your stupid
fucking plants alive,</i>

646
00:40:25,299 --> 00:40:27,843
<i>but you let this relationship
wither and die!</i>

647
00:40:30,012 --> 00:40:31,931
Did you have that prepared?

648
00:40:32,014 --> 00:40:33,015
<i>- What?
- Pussy!</i>

649
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:34,391
You know what? Have fun in Seattle.

650
00:40:34,475 --> 00:40:35,601
You should go to the
Rock 'n' Roll Museum.

651
00:40:35,684 --> 00:40:37,019
It sucks. You'll fit right in.

652
00:40:57,706 --> 00:40:59,458
Are you shitting me?

653
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:08,258
Fahim.

654
00:41:08,384 --> 00:41:10,302
Let's apply for another embed.

655
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:12,554
Because I want to get out of Kabul.

656
00:41:12,638 --> 00:41:15,891
I just need to get out of Kabul.

657
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:19,812
I need "me time", exactly. That's...

658
00:41:19,895 --> 00:41:21,188
See? I told you that <i>O</i> magazine

659
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:24,233
would increase your
understanding of women.

660
00:41:35,077 --> 00:41:37,538
Hey, you guys are 3-5, right?

661
00:41:37,621 --> 00:41:39,498
Do you know a Corporal Coughlin?

662
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:40,582
No, ma'am.

663
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:43,127
Sorry, but I've only been here
for a couple months.

664
00:41:44,003 --> 00:41:47,006
Ma'am, if you set one foot
in front of the other,

665
00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:50,092
there's less chance you lose
both feet if we hit an IED.

666
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:55,764
<i>Vides, make ready.</i>

667
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:06,608
Man, we are definitely losing the war
when it comes to this particular well.

668
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:08,944
I swear to God,
they blow up another well,

669
00:42:09,028 --> 00:42:10,237
I take another pair of boots off.

670
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,448
It's like fucking musical chairs.

671
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:16,076
Hey, do I have to buy a dress
for your wedding?

672
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,413
No. Whatever you wear in Kabul is fine.

673
00:42:20,247 --> 00:42:22,249
- Yeah?
- Yes.

674
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:26,962
The only thing I ask is that
you make sure my friend is there.

675
00:42:28,881 --> 00:42:30,966
Your friend is me.

676
00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:34,053
I get it.

677
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:32,778
- Mount up!
- Jesus, Stern!

678
00:43:32,945 --> 00:43:35,781
General, excuse me. Hey.
General, do you have a minute?

679
00:43:35,864 --> 00:43:38,283
- Not now, Baker.
-It's just...

680
00:43:38,951 --> 00:43:41,578
The Taliban haven't been
destroying the well here.

681
00:43:41,662 --> 00:43:44,248
The women of the village
are destroying it.

682
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:45,958
Or so they tell me.

683
00:43:49,253 --> 00:43:51,505
We dug that well several times
for the women

684
00:43:51,588 --> 00:43:53,298
so they don't have to walk to the river.

685
00:43:53,382 --> 00:43:55,134
But they want to walk to the river.

686
00:43:55,217 --> 00:43:57,761
It's their only chance to be social

687
00:43:57,845 --> 00:44:00,139
and gossip and, you know, hang out.

688
00:44:00,222 --> 00:44:02,933
I think that they have a bunch
of old Soviet landmines,

689
00:44:03,016 --> 00:44:06,145
and they just prop one up
and throw rocks at it.

690
00:44:19,241 --> 00:44:21,618
Kim, did you ever feel like
you're manning that tollgate

691
00:44:21,702 --> 00:44:24,580
and the engineer's yelling,
"I got pig iron, I got pig iron"?

692
00:44:25,497 --> 00:44:28,250
No. I don't know what that means.
But it's very folksy.

693
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:30,502
Also, the women, obviously,
they don't want the men

694
00:44:30,586 --> 00:44:32,171
to know about this, so they are hoping

695
00:44:32,254 --> 00:44:34,840
that you would just refuse
to repair the well this time.

696
00:44:34,923 --> 00:44:35,924
Well, they're in luck.

697
00:44:36,049 --> 00:44:38,385
That's exactly what
I told the mullah, so...

698
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:42,598
Well done, Baker.

699
00:44:43,557 --> 00:44:44,892
Hooyah, General.

700
00:44:46,185 --> 00:44:48,520
Marines say "Oorah".

701
00:44:48,604 --> 00:44:50,814
The Navy says "Hooyah".

702
00:44:50,898 --> 00:44:52,900
- Don't mix those two up.
- Got it.

703
00:44:53,942 --> 00:44:55,694
Have a good... Have a good ride.

704
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:20,427
Kim.

705
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:24,389
Kim.

706
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:29,811
Sorry.

707
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,285
- You look beautiful!
- You look beautiful!

708
00:45:45,369 --> 00:45:46,370
Oh, my God.

709
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,418
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no!

710
00:45:53,502 --> 00:45:54,836
Kim!

711
00:45:56,672 --> 00:45:57,965
What the dick?

712
00:45:58,048 --> 00:46:00,092
Why did Fahim tell me
I could dress like this?

713
00:46:00,175 --> 00:46:02,678
Well, he didn't want you
to have to go buy something.

714
00:46:02,761 --> 00:46:04,554
Oh, my God. I only washed
the front of my hair.

715
00:46:04,638 --> 00:46:05,681
Here. You know what?

716
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:09,518
- I'm going to let you have one of these.
- Thank you.

717
00:46:09,893 --> 00:46:12,479
- Now I look great.
- Now you're ready.

718
00:46:12,562 --> 00:46:14,773
- Now I'm ready to party.
- Oh, she likes it.

719
00:46:16,608 --> 00:46:17,693
- Sure.
- Oh, wow. Well...

720
00:46:36,545 --> 00:46:39,715
It was worse than a unibrow.
It went all the way into his hair.

721
00:46:40,799 --> 00:46:43,135
We all have some reason
for being here.

722
00:46:43,218 --> 00:46:44,720
What's your reason?

723
00:46:44,803 --> 00:46:45,846
What is yours?

724
00:46:45,929 --> 00:46:47,222
I don't have a good one. I'm just here.

725
00:46:47,306 --> 00:46:49,141
Come on, she just told
her unibrow story.

726
00:46:49,224 --> 00:46:50,600
I just... I don't have one.

727
00:46:50,684 --> 00:46:51,768
Come on.

728
00:46:54,062 --> 00:46:57,983
I was at the gym after work
one night. Stationary bike.

729
00:46:58,483 --> 00:47:01,320
Okay? The same bike every day.

730
00:47:01,403 --> 00:47:04,072
And I notice this

731
00:47:04,156 --> 00:47:05,240
indentation in the carpet,

732
00:47:05,324 --> 00:47:06,783
it's, like, a foot in front of my bike.

733
00:47:07,659 --> 00:47:10,912
And I realize that it's from
where my bike used to be.

734
00:47:13,915 --> 00:47:17,502
I have done thousands of miles
on this bike

735
00:47:18,462 --> 00:47:20,589
and I have gone backwards.

736
00:47:20,672 --> 00:47:22,924
I have literally gone backwards.

737
00:47:23,008 --> 00:47:24,217
I just

738
00:47:24,801 --> 00:47:27,929
wanted to blow everything up.
I just wanted out of my job,

739
00:47:28,013 --> 00:47:31,808
writing news scripts for dumb
pretty people to read.

740
00:47:31,892 --> 00:47:33,226
I wanted...

741
00:47:34,186 --> 00:47:36,271
...out of having to decide whether

742
00:47:36,355 --> 00:47:39,608
I should just marry my mildly
depressive boyfriend.

743
00:47:39,733 --> 00:47:41,068
And that's it.

744
00:47:42,194 --> 00:47:44,654
I just... I couldn't look at that

745
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:46,448
fucking carpet anymore.

746
00:47:53,705 --> 00:47:56,958
Well, that is officially the most

747
00:47:57,042 --> 00:47:59,252
American white lady story
I've ever heard.

748
00:47:59,336 --> 00:48:01,671
- Shut up.
- It is.

749
00:48:01,797 --> 00:48:07,636
You know what? Fuck that. You are
a battle-tested foreign correspondent.

750
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:11,014
You're a solid Kabul 9.5.

751
00:48:11,098 --> 00:48:13,392
And you are fucking single, all right?

752
00:48:13,475 --> 00:48:16,395
So that lady back at the gym,
she's dead.

753
00:48:17,229 --> 00:48:18,730
This is your life.

754
00:48:42,546 --> 00:48:44,673
<i>Despite Taliban threats,
election observers</i>

755
00:48:44,756 --> 00:48:46,466
<i>are reporting high voter turnout,</i>

756
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:47,926
<i>especially in cities.</i>

757
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:51,888
<i>A British fighter-bomber last week
reduced this compound to rubble.</i>

758
00:48:51,972 --> 00:48:55,016
<i>...not to cooperate.
Oh, God. Christ, there's a...</i>

759
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:59,271
<i>Bahzo! There's</i> a <i>bahzo here!</i>

760
00:48:59,354 --> 00:49:02,357
<i>The surprise visit from
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.</i>

761
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:05,235
<i>Today, Kabul's
first licensed female driver,</i>

762
00:49:05,318 --> 00:49:07,988
<i>Gulbahar Yousofy, hits the road.</i>

763
00:49:10,532 --> 00:49:13,118
<i>That sucks. That sucks for women.</i>

764
00:49:15,871 --> 00:49:17,038
Thank you.

765
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:21,543
Congratulations on your promotion,

766
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:23,253
- Mr. Attorney General.
- Thank you.

767
00:49:23,336 --> 00:49:24,880
As I said, we could have
done this over the phone.

768
00:49:24,963 --> 00:49:27,424
I'm just looking for a statement
on sharia in Kandahar.

769
00:49:27,507 --> 00:49:31,303
I understand that you are no longer
with your special friend Chris.

770
00:49:32,888 --> 00:49:33,930
Who told you that?

771
00:49:34,014 --> 00:49:35,515
Very little happens in Afghanistan

772
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,852
that Ali Massoud Sadiq
does not know about.

773
00:49:38,935 --> 00:49:40,020
Very little.

774
00:49:40,562 --> 00:49:42,898
- May I show you something?
- Of course.

775
00:49:49,362 --> 00:49:50,822
You have a bed in your office.

776
00:49:50,906 --> 00:49:51,990
Yes.

777
00:49:52,824 --> 00:49:54,659
There is a bed here now.

778
00:49:57,496 --> 00:50:01,583
So, no comment
on sharia in Kandahar or...

779
00:50:06,254 --> 00:50:07,672
No comment.

780
00:50:07,756 --> 00:50:10,217
- We are going to ISAF later, yes?
- I don't know.

781
00:50:10,342 --> 00:50:12,844
Pressers and "right of boom" crap.
Who cares?

782
00:50:12,928 --> 00:50:14,137
We need
to enterprise something. Okay?

783
00:50:14,221 --> 00:50:16,264
We need to get out of the bubble.

784
00:50:16,848 --> 00:50:18,225
That hit the net.

785
00:50:18,683 --> 00:50:20,435
- The what?
- It hit the net.

786
00:50:20,769 --> 00:50:22,771
- The invisible net?
- Yes.

787
00:50:22,854 --> 00:50:24,523
- My point.
- Let's go. Bullshit.

788
00:50:24,606 --> 00:50:27,150
You know, Kim, the reason that
your village well story got traction is

789
00:50:27,234 --> 00:50:29,778
because it wasn't a bang-bang,
it was about women's rights.

790
00:50:29,903 --> 00:50:31,655
It was a brilliant piece, that.

791
00:50:31,738 --> 00:50:32,989
Oh, fucking hell.

792
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:36,618
- We should go to Kandahar.
- No, too dangerous.

793
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:38,912
No way. It's a wee bit
fluid down there these days,

794
00:50:38,995 --> 00:50:40,121
security-wise.

795
00:50:40,205 --> 00:50:41,957
Yeah, it might be
a bit much for you, Nic?

796
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,041
You're a bit late to the whole

797
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:44,709
"Kandahar's gone to shit" party.
You know?

798
00:50:44,793 --> 00:50:46,753
What about the woman thing
where the sharia law is back?

799
00:50:46,836 --> 00:50:48,463
And there was a firebombing
the other day.

800
00:50:48,547 --> 00:50:49,548
Yeah, I think it's worth the risk.

801
00:50:49,631 --> 00:50:51,383
That's easy for you to say, mate,

802
00:50:51,466 --> 00:50:54,261
sitting there in your cozzie
taking photos of the fucking garden.

803
00:50:54,344 --> 00:50:56,721
Look, Nicky, I know
you've been specially trained

804
00:50:56,805 --> 00:50:59,432
to protect New Zealand from,
what, fucking dolphins?

805
00:50:59,849 --> 00:51:01,893
But I'm not exactly
a war zone virgin, you know?

806
00:51:01,977 --> 00:51:04,604
I was kidnapped by the AIG
when they were still called that.

807
00:51:04,688 --> 00:51:06,147
Why dolphins?

808
00:51:06,982 --> 00:51:08,316
What do dolphins got to do
with New Zealand?

809
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,401
Nothing to do with it. I'm just...

810
00:51:09,484 --> 00:51:10,610
White pointers and sharks,

811
00:51:10,694 --> 00:51:11,736
but the dolphins never hurt anyone.

812
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:14,239
I know they've not hurt anyone, mate.
I'm just making the point...

813
00:51:14,322 --> 00:51:17,409
I'm not gonna protect my country
from an animal that hasn't hurt anyone.

814
00:51:17,492 --> 00:51:18,660
<i>Oh, Jesus Christ.</i>

815
00:51:18,994 --> 00:51:21,663
Dolphins? What a joke.

816
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:23,331
I'll come with you
in the car if there's room.

817
00:51:23,415 --> 00:51:25,125
Oh, great, we're all going to Kandahar!

818
00:51:27,544 --> 00:51:30,630
I can make some calls.
We can take my car.

819
00:51:31,006 --> 00:51:33,258
Kim, if we are going to Kandahar,

820
00:51:33,341 --> 00:51:35,719
you will need to buy some new clothes.

821
00:51:36,344 --> 00:51:37,512
I can't...

822
00:51:46,563 --> 00:51:49,691
It's so pretty, I don't even want to vote.

823
00:52:18,094 --> 00:52:20,972
I'm flipping you the bird
in here right now.

824
00:52:21,056 --> 00:52:22,307
- Is this your car, Fahim?
- Yes.

825
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:23,808
This is a fucking piece of shit.

826
00:52:23,892 --> 00:52:25,602
I think it's very nice.

827
00:52:30,565 --> 00:52:32,275
No one is staring at me. It's weird.

828
00:52:32,359 --> 00:52:35,195
You are in the Blue Prison now.

829
00:53:08,978 --> 00:53:10,355
Fahim, what does the graffiti say?

830
00:53:10,897 --> 00:53:12,941
"No education for woman."

831
00:53:17,028 --> 00:53:18,780
Brian.

832
00:53:40,969 --> 00:53:42,303
Fahim, what's going on up there?

833
00:53:45,432 --> 00:53:46,641
The Taliban used to do this.

834
00:53:47,517 --> 00:53:50,019
Execute the radios and televisions.

835
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:56,025
Oh, shit!

836
00:54:00,864 --> 00:54:01,865
Get out of the way!

837
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:03,241
Move on! Move on!

838
00:54:03,324 --> 00:54:05,618
You guys can't go out there, but I can.

839
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:13,918
- Kim, come back.
- Kim, wait! Come back.

840
00:54:56,544 --> 00:54:58,379
Kim, now.
We must hurry. We must hurry.

841
00:55:13,937 --> 00:55:15,438
Get in the car!

842
00:55:18,233 --> 00:55:19,818
Get out of here!

843
00:55:22,487 --> 00:55:26,282
That was a men's park, Kim! Men only!

844
00:55:27,951 --> 00:55:29,118
Fuck!

845
00:55:31,454 --> 00:55:33,414
<i>Bebakhshid, Fahim.</i>

846
00:55:40,755 --> 00:55:42,173
...coalition capacity,

847
00:55:42,257 --> 00:55:43,758
priorities and support.

848
00:55:44,092 --> 00:55:48,596
Let's look now at the 12 first-tier drivers
in the current COIN paradigm.

849
00:55:49,264 --> 00:55:50,223
Shit.

850
00:55:50,306 --> 00:55:52,141
Tactical and institutional...

851
00:55:52,267 --> 00:55:53,476
...is always in purple,

852
00:55:53,601 --> 00:55:54,936
and noting as such...

853
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:58,523
- Kim Baker.
- Sir, do you have a minute?

854
00:55:58,773 --> 00:56:02,277
If I'm understanding this briefing,
I have all the fucking time in the world.

855
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,779
Okay. Well,
I'm covering the girls' school

856
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:06,155
in Kandahar that was firebombed

857
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:09,325
and I'm wondering if you could
give me something, on background,

858
00:56:09,409 --> 00:56:12,871
just about the security situation here

859
00:56:12,954 --> 00:56:14,789
and the state of the war in general.

860
00:56:14,873 --> 00:56:17,876
Yeah, I can give you something:
This war is like fucking a gorilla.

861
00:56:17,959 --> 00:56:20,128
You keep going till
the gorilla wants to stop.

862
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:23,131
I think I can paraphrase that.

863
00:56:23,214 --> 00:56:24,549
<i>Knock yourself out.</i>

864
00:56:39,105 --> 00:56:44,360
You know, Afghanistan produces
90% of the world's narcotic opiates.

865
00:56:44,444 --> 00:56:45,862
So they say.

866
00:56:46,988 --> 00:56:49,866
When I worked in the hospital,

867
00:56:49,949 --> 00:56:52,952
these men, heroin addicts,

868
00:56:53,036 --> 00:56:55,788
would come in with a child.

869
00:56:55,872 --> 00:56:58,625
They'd say, "Oh, my son,
he broke his arm."

870
00:56:59,667 --> 00:57:02,170
And while we were tending to the child,

871
00:57:02,253 --> 00:57:04,505
the men would steal our morphine.

872
00:57:05,173 --> 00:57:09,344
And we would wonder how
the arm got broken to begin with.

873
00:57:09,427 --> 00:57:11,596
What are we talking about, Fahim?

874
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:18,227
The human body
produces its own heroin.

875
00:57:18,353 --> 00:57:22,899
In fact, when the fight-or-flight instinct
is activated in the hypothalamus,

876
00:57:23,024 --> 00:57:28,029
your body releases endorphins,
dopamine and norepinephrine.

877
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:33,785
That is heroin, cocaine
and amphetamine, all at once.

878
00:57:33,868 --> 00:57:37,372
Okay, great. Are we having
the Afghan version of this conversation,

879
00:57:37,455 --> 00:57:38,539
wherein New York we would have

880
00:57:38,665 --> 00:57:41,125
gotten to the point, like,
five minutes ago?

881
00:57:44,462 --> 00:57:46,547
There is a reason
to believe that a person

882
00:57:46,631 --> 00:57:49,133
can get addicted to this type of high.

883
00:57:50,134 --> 00:57:52,637
Soldiers, athletes...

884
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,639
War reporters. Got it.

885
00:57:55,473 --> 00:57:59,435
An addict always needs
a greater and greater dosage.

886
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:03,398
And then people make mistakes,
people get hurt.

887
00:58:03,481 --> 00:58:06,401
I get it. You're a newlywed. I can

888
00:58:06,484 --> 00:58:09,070
probably get them
to go up to $125 a day.

889
00:58:16,828 --> 00:58:18,496
Let us have the

890
00:58:19,497 --> 00:58:23,167
American version of this conversation.

891
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:24,669
Okay.

892
00:58:26,421 --> 00:58:29,257
I do not want to work with you anymore.

893
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:31,592
No, okay, wait.
Fahim, I know I fucked up.

894
00:58:31,676 --> 00:58:34,178
I do not think you do.

895
00:58:34,262 --> 00:58:36,389
- Hear me out.
- Kim, no.

896
00:58:37,098 --> 00:58:41,853
I am now married.
I want to have children.

897
00:58:41,936 --> 00:58:43,938
It will not happen again. It's not gonna...

898
00:58:44,022 --> 00:58:49,027
"I ride after a deer and find
myself chased by a hog.

899
00:58:49,777 --> 00:58:51,446
"I plot to get what I want

900
00:58:52,488 --> 00:58:54,282
"and I end up in prison.

901
00:58:54,365 --> 00:58:57,869
"I dig pits to trap others and I fall in.

902
00:58:58,786 --> 00:59:01,372
"I should be suspicious of what I want."

903
00:59:02,915 --> 00:59:04,917
I don't know what that means.

904
00:59:09,213 --> 00:59:10,548
You do.

905
00:59:17,722 --> 00:59:18,723
Fahim?

906
01:00:01,974 --> 01:00:03,601
I can't breathe in here.

907
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:05,937
Time to take a walk.

908
01:00:06,437 --> 01:00:08,106
I have to go outside.

909
01:00:08,856 --> 01:00:10,775
I have to go home.

910
01:00:16,364 --> 01:00:19,075
Put on your headscarf

911
01:00:35,883 --> 01:00:37,135
Shit.

912
01:00:37,218 --> 01:00:38,553
It's the wrong house.

913
01:00:43,808 --> 01:00:45,143
Oh, shit.

914
01:01:08,583 --> 01:01:10,459
Kim?

915
01:01:10,585 --> 01:01:12,295
What the hell are you doing?

916
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:17,550
Here.

917
01:01:17,633 --> 01:01:21,637
Kim, sip that. Okay? You all right?

918
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:25,725
Keep sipping that.
You're all right. It's okay.

919
01:01:25,808 --> 01:01:27,143
It's okay. Hey.

920
01:01:28,102 --> 01:01:29,270
Hey, it's all right.

921
01:01:29,353 --> 01:01:32,440
Oi. Now, that there was a bit of fun.

922
01:01:32,523 --> 01:01:33,816
- Are you mental?
- Okay, mate...

923
01:01:33,941 --> 01:01:35,318
I'm not your mate.
I'm gonna ask you again,

924
01:01:35,401 --> 01:01:36,444
are you fucking mental?

925
01:01:36,527 --> 01:01:39,780
- Come on, lain, it's not his fault.
- What's your job again?

926
01:01:39,864 --> 01:01:41,407
Because if I hadn't come back
to see you lot

927
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:43,784
because I stole a bottle of sake
from a Japanese travel writer...

928
01:01:43,868 --> 01:01:44,911
Wait, you have sake?

929
01:01:44,994 --> 01:01:46,454
...you could've killed her, "mate!"

930
01:01:46,537 --> 01:01:48,122
Oh, fuck off.

931
01:01:49,332 --> 01:01:50,791
Jesus! What the fuck?

932
01:01:52,251 --> 01:01:53,794
Dude, what the fuck?

933
01:01:54,003 --> 01:01:56,005
Did you fucking sucker punch me?

934
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:57,506
You broke my nose.

935
01:01:58,049 --> 01:02:00,218
- You fucking American?
- Are you a Yank?

936
01:02:00,301 --> 01:02:02,220
I'm Canadian, you asshole.

937
01:02:02,762 --> 01:02:04,305
I almost fucked a Canadian?

938
01:02:04,388 --> 01:02:07,308
I'd stay down if I were you, ya wee cunt.

939
01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:09,477
And that's not a term of affection.

940
01:02:10,603 --> 01:02:11,938
<i>Fuck that.</i>

941
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:24,867
Oh, God!

942
01:02:28,412 --> 01:02:29,497
- Wait.
- Oh, fuck.

943
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:33,251
Iain, don't carry me around.
I'm not a fucking baby.

944
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:36,212
Goddamn it.

945
01:02:36,295 --> 01:02:37,964
What the fuck are you doing?

946
01:02:43,094 --> 01:02:45,179
- Take it off.
- I'm fucking trying to take it off!

947
01:02:45,263 --> 01:02:47,473
Oh, God, I'm gonna put it
in you so fucking hard,

948
01:02:47,556 --> 01:02:48,933
-you're gonna fucking get it.
- Don't talk.

949
01:02:49,016 --> 01:02:51,185
- I want everything in your mouth.
-lain, just shut it.

950
01:02:51,269 --> 01:02:53,896
I'll take you lying down, come on.

951
01:02:54,021 --> 01:02:56,691
Do you have one of those
weird little penises?

952
01:02:56,774 --> 01:02:58,943
No! This is how I want to go.

953
01:02:59,026 --> 01:03:01,028
No, I don't want to see myself.

954
01:03:01,153 --> 01:03:02,655
Roll off!

955
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:04,782
Okay, fuck it.

956
01:03:06,867 --> 01:03:09,495
Oh, God, I fucking...

957
01:03:09,578 --> 01:03:10,621
What are you doing?

958
01:03:10,705 --> 01:03:13,124
I'm just putting my fucking
finger in your mouth.

959
01:03:13,207 --> 01:03:14,208
No!

960
01:03:14,292 --> 01:03:16,294
Come on, just put everything
in your mouth.

961
01:03:17,795 --> 01:03:20,464
- Do you want me to go?
- No.

962
01:03:35,187 --> 01:03:36,897
There's aught like a good shag.

963
01:03:37,231 --> 01:03:39,400
Okay, let's try to be adults here.

964
01:03:39,567 --> 01:03:41,068
I think we were.

965
01:03:41,319 --> 01:03:44,196
Obviously this was just
a Kabubble thing, right?

966
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:45,323
Just a

967
01:03:46,032 --> 01:03:49,285
fun mistake
where one of us had an orgasm.

968
01:03:49,994 --> 01:03:52,830
I mean, we're both in a really bad place.
And then you

969
01:03:53,164 --> 01:03:55,333
punched Nic.

970
01:03:55,791 --> 01:03:57,501
I don't know. It's endorphins, right?

971
01:03:59,003 --> 01:04:00,463
Nope, that's not what this is.

972
01:04:00,546 --> 01:04:02,256
No, you don't need to be gallant.

973
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:04,091
I'm serious.

974
01:04:05,092 --> 01:04:08,262
I fancy you, Kim Baker.

975
01:04:09,013 --> 01:04:10,181
I do.

976
01:04:10,765 --> 01:04:14,352
Of all the dozens of women
in this country, I chose you.

977
01:04:14,435 --> 01:04:16,228
No, you didn't, because this is not me.

978
01:04:16,312 --> 01:04:17,438
I would never do this.

979
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:20,066
Precisely. Because you're
not you anymore.

980
01:04:20,149 --> 01:04:22,109
You're in the Kabubble.
You said so yourself.

981
01:04:22,193 --> 01:04:24,528
Don't fucking hide.

982
01:04:25,863 --> 01:04:28,366
Kim, you know the frog
in the pot of water?

983
01:04:28,449 --> 01:04:31,577
You raise the temperature bit by bit,

984
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:33,287
the frog doesn't notice?

985
01:04:34,372 --> 01:04:35,748
That's what this place

986
01:04:35,831 --> 01:04:37,792
and that's what this job
does to all of us.

987
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:41,379
It changes your perception
of what's normal until...

988
01:04:43,297 --> 01:04:44,965
...until here we are.

989
01:04:46,467 --> 01:04:47,843
You know the frog boils to death

990
01:04:47,927 --> 01:04:49,512
-at the end of that, right?
- Nope.

991
01:04:49,595 --> 01:04:50,805
- Yeah.
- Nope.

992
01:04:57,937 --> 01:04:59,939
Is that my toothbrush?

993
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:05,069
<i>What's going on
with my Kandahar piece, Ed'?</i>

994
01:05:05,152 --> 01:05:06,654
<i>Jerry killed it.</i>

995
01:05:06,737 --> 01:05:07,738
Wait, who killed it?

996
01:05:07,822 --> 01:05:10,324
<i>Jerry Taub, head of the network, Kim.</i>

997
01:05:10,408 --> 01:05:12,159
- What happened to Angela?
- She <i>left.</i>

998
01:05:12,243 --> 01:05:15,496
<i>She's running a website
for women or something.</i>

999
01:05:15,579 --> 01:05:19,333
<i>Look, I can't sell Afghanistan
in Monday meetings.</i>

1000
01:05:19,417 --> 01:05:22,753
<i>Your war's got chronic
same-shit-different-day-itis.</i>

1001
01:05:22,837 --> 01:05:25,172
Great. What am I even doing here, Ed?

1002
01:05:25,256 --> 01:05:28,509
<i>I wouldn't ask that too loudly, Kim.</i>

1003
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:32,179
<i>Though I'd be thrilled to have
you back at your old desk.</i>

1004
01:05:38,018 --> 01:05:39,520
That's all I got.

1005
01:05:42,982 --> 01:05:46,360
Hey, I heard that Nic quit
and you fucked lain!

1006
01:05:46,444 --> 01:05:47,486
Whoa, hold on.

1007
01:05:47,570 --> 01:05:49,822
Listen, the lain thing
is not a thing, okay?

1008
01:05:49,905 --> 01:05:52,032
We have the same size hands. I can't.

1009
01:05:52,116 --> 01:05:54,743
It's just work has been
a little frustrating.

1010
01:05:54,827 --> 01:05:55,870
Yeah. I get it.

1011
01:05:55,953 --> 01:05:57,705
Because Afghanistan
doesn't rate anymore.

1012
01:05:57,788 --> 01:05:59,206
That is bullshit.

1013
01:05:59,290 --> 01:06:00,875
You've got to find
your own luck here, babe,

1014
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:02,209
you know that.

1015
01:06:05,212 --> 01:06:06,422
What?

1016
01:06:07,673 --> 01:06:09,133
What? What is that?

1017
01:06:09,216 --> 01:06:11,594
Hey! You're hooking up
Tanya in the Tribals?

1018
01:06:11,677 --> 01:06:13,095
What the fuck, Jaweed?

1019
01:06:13,179 --> 01:06:14,847
Her network will pay me triple.

1020
01:06:14,972 --> 01:06:16,807
I taught you how to clear
your Internet history, okay?

1021
01:06:16,891 --> 01:06:18,476
What has Vanderpoel
ever done for you?

1022
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:19,935
Give me a break, man.

1023
01:06:20,019 --> 01:06:22,146
Whatever. You owe me.
What else do you have?

1024
01:06:22,229 --> 01:06:23,314
You're Ghilzai, right?

1025
01:06:23,397 --> 01:06:26,233
Do you have any other connections
to members of the Ghilzai family?

1026
01:06:26,317 --> 01:06:27,985
- You mean Hekmatyar?
- Maybe.

1027
01:06:28,068 --> 01:06:30,362
Are you fucking crazy, Kim? Please.

1028
01:06:31,906 --> 01:06:33,616
Hey! Nabil! Hey.

1029
01:06:33,699 --> 01:06:35,534
Are you still in touch with that ISI guy

1030
01:06:35,618 --> 01:06:38,245
who says he knows
who killed Abdul Haq?

1031
01:06:38,329 --> 01:06:41,081
That guy? He's dead two years.

1032
01:06:54,595 --> 01:06:55,721
Hey.

1033
01:07:04,772 --> 01:07:06,190
Oh, for fuck's sake.

1034
01:07:06,273 --> 01:07:07,608
Mrs. MacKelpie.

1035
01:07:12,071 --> 01:07:14,240
- Twice?
- Two and a half, actually.

1036
01:07:15,950 --> 01:07:18,452
I don't remember
what happened last night.

1037
01:07:18,536 --> 01:07:20,871
Kabulhappened,
my wee froggy in the pot.

1038
01:07:20,955 --> 01:07:23,457
Did I not wear a headscarf?
Where's my phone?

1039
01:07:23,541 --> 01:07:24,625
I believe I threw your mobile
in my cupboard.

1040
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:25,793
Why?

1041
01:07:25,876 --> 01:07:28,128
Because mid-coitus
you tried to call Tanya

1042
01:07:28,254 --> 01:07:30,297
about some bloody wild goose chase
in the Tribals.

1043
01:07:30,381 --> 01:07:31,715
I told you about that?

1044
01:07:31,799 --> 01:07:32,883
Well, it was hard to understand you

1045
01:07:32,967 --> 01:07:35,553
once you asked me to stuff
your knickers in your mouth.

1046
01:07:37,012 --> 01:07:38,806
I'm joking, Kim. That didn't happen.

1047
01:07:38,931 --> 01:07:40,724
Fuck. I am...

1048
01:07:40,808 --> 01:07:42,643
I am fucking losing it.

1049
01:07:43,227 --> 01:07:44,728
I need a win.

1050
01:07:44,812 --> 01:07:45,854
Christ, if you're that hard up,

1051
01:07:45,938 --> 01:07:47,731
I'll share my Badakhshan thing with you.

1052
01:07:47,815 --> 01:07:49,149
What Badakhshan thing?

1053
01:07:49,233 --> 01:07:51,819
You know China won the contract
to mine for gold up there.

1054
01:07:51,902 --> 01:07:54,405
They built roads, airport,
housing, all that.

1055
01:07:54,488 --> 01:07:58,534
Well, guess whose responsibility it is
to protect the investment of Red China

1056
01:07:58,617 --> 01:08:00,494
in this restive nation?

1057
01:08:00,995 --> 01:08:04,665
American troops, Chinese gold.
Oh, lain, that's really good.

1058
01:08:04,748 --> 01:08:05,916
People are gonna get mad.

1059
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,835
Just waiting for my guy
to give me the green light.

1060
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:10,421
You pay for the trip,
I'll share the story with you. Easy peasy.

1061
01:08:10,504 --> 01:08:13,173
Really? Thank you. That's...

1062
01:08:14,174 --> 01:08:15,217
I owe you one.

1063
01:08:15,342 --> 01:08:18,137
Well, how about a half of one?

1064
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:19,513
And then we can make it an even three.

1065
01:08:19,597 --> 01:08:21,724
Yeah. Or I could buy you breakfast.

1066
01:08:22,683 --> 01:08:25,019
Or a half of one and we can
make it an even three.

1067
01:08:25,102 --> 01:08:28,105
I think breakfast
is of equal monetary value.

1068
01:08:28,188 --> 01:08:30,107
My middle name is Eoghan.

1069
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:32,276
Which is Erse... Shut up.

1070
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:33,902
It's Erse for Owen.

1071
01:08:34,194 --> 01:08:35,446
"Oo-hee"?

1072
01:08:35,529 --> 01:08:37,448
-Iain "Oo-hee".
- Don't bother.

1073
01:08:37,531 --> 01:08:38,782
Where is Bin Laden?

1074
01:08:38,866 --> 01:08:39,867
People think he's in Pakistan, right?

1075
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:40,951
Yeah.

1076
01:08:41,035 --> 01:08:42,786
You've got egg in your beard. Hang on.

1077
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:43,954
Thank you.

1078
01:08:44,038 --> 01:08:46,707
Your national animal is the unicorn.

1079
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:47,791
I think it's romantic.

1080
01:08:47,875 --> 01:08:49,877
That is the national animal
of the kingdom I ruled

1081
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,045
when I was eight.

1082
01:08:51,128 --> 01:08:53,130
Who's your favorite Three Stooge?

1083
01:08:54,548 --> 01:08:57,718
Larry. Because he's put upon
in a way that I identify with.

1084
01:08:58,552 --> 01:09:00,220
He's the Art Garfunkel, right?

1085
01:09:00,304 --> 01:09:01,680
Yeah.

1086
01:09:01,764 --> 01:09:04,767
So, I thought I might like to
hang out with you for a bit.

1087
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:06,435
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

1088
01:09:07,436 --> 01:09:08,937
Do you really want to know
what I want to do?

1089
01:09:09,021 --> 01:09:09,980
Yeah. Okay.

1090
01:09:10,064 --> 01:09:11,398
I'd like to kiss you.

1091
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:16,028
Who knew?

1092
01:09:20,366 --> 01:09:21,575
Here's my little man.

1093
01:09:21,659 --> 01:09:23,786
No, lain, don't. It's a scam.

1094
01:09:23,869 --> 01:09:26,121
Do you think so? Really?

1095
01:09:26,205 --> 01:09:28,832
I know it's a scam, Kim. So what?

1096
01:09:28,916 --> 01:09:30,918
He's still begging in the street.
Hey, Abrahaim.

1097
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:33,212
There's my boy.

1098
01:09:43,972 --> 01:09:45,766
I knew I'd win you over.

1099
01:09:51,355 --> 01:09:52,481
<i>Jesus).!</i>

1100
01:09:59,655 --> 01:10:02,574
What the fuck, Jaweed?
Are they coming or not?

1101
01:10:03,242 --> 01:10:04,284
Here they are.

1102
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,208
<i>There they are.</i>

1103
01:10:11,291 --> 01:10:15,129
4-6800, line six north.

1104
01:10:19,925 --> 01:10:21,301
Standing by approval.

1105
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:23,137
We are clear to engage target.

1106
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:25,264
Roger. Clear to engage target.

1107
01:10:33,147 --> 01:10:34,732
It is him. That's my guy.

1108
01:10:35,649 --> 01:10:37,276
If we go anywhere,
Jaweed, we take our vehicle.

1109
01:10:37,359 --> 01:10:38,485
No carpooling.

1110
01:10:38,569 --> 01:10:39,737
All right. Okay.

1111
01:10:48,036 --> 01:10:49,872
Shit! Shit!

1112
01:10:50,789 --> 01:10:51,999
Stay calm.

1113
01:10:59,465 --> 01:11:00,466
Splash.

1114
01:11:00,549 --> 01:11:01,925
Cease laser. Safe laser.

1115
01:11:02,009 --> 01:11:03,677
Laser off. Laser safe.

1116
01:11:27,618 --> 01:11:29,953
I'm looking for someone. Excuse me.

1117
01:11:37,377 --> 01:11:39,213
- Oh, my God. Tanya.
- Hi.

1118
01:11:39,296 --> 01:11:40,672
- Jesus.

1119
01:11:42,299 --> 01:11:44,176
Jaweed's dead.

1120
01:11:44,301 --> 01:11:47,095
- Andy's in surgery.
- I know. lain talked to Colin.

1121
01:11:47,221 --> 01:11:50,057
- Jesus!
- I know. It's fucked.

1122
01:11:52,476 --> 01:11:54,394
You know, Colin was rolling.

1123
01:11:55,813 --> 01:11:58,148
What, like, rolling-rolling?
You have tape?

1124
01:11:58,232 --> 01:12:00,400
He got the whole fucking thing.

1125
01:12:00,484 --> 01:12:03,320
I'm going to go live with it
as soon as they let me out of here.

1126
01:12:04,905 --> 01:12:07,157
Can you fucking believe it?

1127
01:12:07,491 --> 01:12:08,992
Hey.

1128
01:12:09,159 --> 01:12:10,327
Hi.

1129
01:12:10,744 --> 01:12:11,787
Aye.

1130
01:12:12,913 --> 01:12:14,289
- How are you?
- You doing all right?

1131
01:12:16,083 --> 01:12:17,751
Holy shit!

1132
01:12:17,835 --> 01:12:19,920
<i>And as we watch it
again there, Susanna,</i>

1133
01:12:20,045 --> 01:12:23,590
<i>you can actually see the Hellfire missile
right before it detonates.</i>

1134
01:12:28,178 --> 01:12:29,680
What is going on with Badakhshan?

1135
01:12:29,763 --> 01:12:32,015
Snow's killing us.

1136
01:12:32,099 --> 01:12:33,267
So unless your network wants

1137
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:34,935
to stump up the money
for the helicopter,

1138
01:12:35,018 --> 01:12:37,396
we'll have to wait
till they clear the passes.

1139
01:12:37,479 --> 01:12:39,022
Kim, we have
a bit of a situation outside.

1140
01:12:40,607 --> 01:12:41,775
What?

1141
01:12:41,859 --> 01:12:43,569
I just need you to see something.

1142
01:12:43,694 --> 01:12:45,112
Sorry to interrupt.

1143
01:12:45,195 --> 01:12:47,614
- Did he say what he wanted?
- I don't know.

1144
01:12:52,035 --> 01:12:53,370
Fuck.

1145
01:12:57,916 --> 01:13:00,043
Qadar. Qadar, it's okay. You can go in.

1146
01:13:00,127 --> 01:13:01,461
He just wants to talk to me.

1147
01:13:01,587 --> 01:13:03,297
- Okay. Okay.
-It's okay.

1148
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:05,883
Please, do not cover
your hair on my account.

1149
01:13:05,966 --> 01:13:07,301
It's such beautiful hair.

1150
01:13:07,384 --> 01:13:09,595
It's like the hide of a fine horse.

1151
01:13:09,678 --> 01:13:12,139
Sadiq, what are you doing here?

1152
01:13:13,473 --> 01:13:16,894
I was just going home
from closing a woman brothel

1153
01:13:16,977 --> 01:13:19,062
when I told my driver,

1154
01:13:19,146 --> 01:13:23,525
"Mahboobullah, this is where
my best friend Kimberly lives!"

1155
01:13:23,609 --> 01:13:26,987
But she has been a bad friend lately.

1156
01:13:28,155 --> 01:13:29,823
She does not call.

1157
01:13:30,574 --> 01:13:33,243
She does not invite me to her party.

1158
01:13:33,577 --> 01:13:34,786
I'm sorry,

1159
01:13:34,870 --> 01:13:39,374
but I didn't think the Attorney General
of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan

1160
01:13:39,499 --> 01:13:40,709
went to parties at guesthouses.

1161
01:13:40,792 --> 01:13:42,502
And why not?

1162
01:13:42,586 --> 01:13:44,671
I am still a man, no?

1163
01:13:44,755 --> 01:13:46,673
I love music.

1164
01:13:46,757 --> 01:13:49,176
I love to dance!

1165
01:13:59,603 --> 01:14:00,604
But

1166
01:14:01,688 --> 01:14:04,191
eventhough
you have been a bad friend,

1167
01:14:05,192 --> 01:14:06,777
I want you to be happy.

1168
01:14:08,695 --> 01:14:10,572
Do you have a special friend?

1169
01:14:11,698 --> 01:14:13,033
Because

1170
01:14:14,952 --> 01:14:17,704
I would love to be your special friend.

1171
01:14:19,289 --> 01:14:20,791
Would you like that, Kim?

1172
01:14:23,794 --> 01:14:25,170
You're a bad friend.

1173
01:14:26,046 --> 01:14:28,131
You are a bad friend.

1174
01:14:28,215 --> 01:14:32,135
In America, I would get
a book deal out of this shit!

1175
01:14:32,219 --> 01:14:34,304
You can't just do this, okay?

1176
01:14:34,388 --> 01:14:36,556
I haven't been on the air in months!

1177
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:40,394
My best friend here almost died,
and I am jealous of her!

1178
01:14:40,811 --> 01:14:42,312
And I am just...

1179
01:14:43,063 --> 01:14:45,732
Fuck this! All of it!

1180
01:15:09,923 --> 01:15:11,425
That was a bomb.

1181
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:14,511
Hello! So, wait!

1182
01:15:14,594 --> 01:15:17,055
Who is fronting the show?

1183
01:15:17,139 --> 01:15:18,974
Tucker? No, I don't know who that is.

1184
01:15:19,057 --> 01:15:22,352
Okay, well, I could go live
for the overnights, but this is...

1185
01:15:22,436 --> 01:15:25,689
"Satellite time?"
No, I have a dedicated feed.

1186
01:15:27,024 --> 01:15:28,442
Since when?

1187
01:15:28,608 --> 01:15:29,609
<i>This is Tucker Wang.</i>

1188
01:15:29,735 --> 01:15:30,861
This is Kim Baker.

1189
01:15:30,944 --> 01:15:33,447
Why am I being told that
I don't have a sat hookup?

1190
01:15:33,613 --> 01:15:35,449
<i>Because you're on the hourly plan now.</i>

1191
01:15:35,574 --> 01:15:37,117
<i>And either way, the show is full tonight.</i>

1192
01:15:37,242 --> 01:15:38,452
No. Who is your boss?

1193
01:15:38,535 --> 01:15:40,912
I want to talk to this
Jerry whatever, Taub.

1194
01:15:41,079 --> 01:15:43,623
<i>Okay, look, Jerry has mentioned
Afghanistan to me once,</i>

1195
01:15:43,707 --> 01:15:45,542
<i>and mentioned it to know why
the only good story to come</i>

1196
01:15:45,625 --> 01:15:47,335
<i>out of there in</i> a <i>year
was on another network.</i>

1197
01:15:47,419 --> 01:15:49,713
What, Tanya's thing?
No, I've got shit like that.

1198
01:15:49,796 --> 01:15:51,506
I'm waiting for the snow to melt!

1199
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:53,050
I want to talk to Jerry.

1200
01:15:53,133 --> 01:15:56,386
<i>If I could just get you to get me</i> a <i>story
that somebody would care about,</i>

1201
01:15:56,470 --> 01:15:58,055
<i>it would be fine. But meanwhile...</i>

1202
01:15:58,138 --> 01:15:59,097
Okay, what if I come to New York

1203
01:15:59,181 --> 01:16:01,224
and I burst into Jerry's office?
How about that?

1204
01:16:01,308 --> 01:16:03,060
<i>Well, that might look
like I hadn't done my job.</i>

1205
01:16:03,143 --> 01:16:05,020
Perfect. See you Wednesday.

1206
01:16:05,103 --> 01:16:06,104
Cunt.

1207
01:16:10,067 --> 01:16:11,943
Kim.

1208
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:14,988
Kim, look at these dogs.

1209
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:17,866
How does this end?

1210
01:16:17,949 --> 01:16:19,951
A bucket of cold water, I suppose.

1211
01:16:23,663 --> 01:16:24,664
No.

1212
01:16:28,168 --> 01:16:29,669
How does this

1213
01:16:30,921 --> 01:16:32,172
end?

1214
01:16:34,508 --> 01:16:37,677
I don't really know, Kim.

1215
01:16:38,512 --> 01:16:42,265
We grow old together?
Get a cottage in the country?

1216
01:16:42,349 --> 01:16:44,017
Raise chickens?

1217
01:16:44,101 --> 01:16:45,727
Eat scrambled eggs off each other?

1218
01:16:45,852 --> 01:16:48,855
Look, we're good, aren't we?
We'll always have Kabul.

1219
01:16:48,939 --> 01:16:50,607
No, we won't. We won't "always have" it

1220
01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:51,900
because I have to go home.

1221
01:16:52,025 --> 01:16:53,610
No, this is home.

1222
01:16:53,693 --> 01:16:57,197
I have to go to New York City
and justify my life

1223
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,282
to somebody named Jerry

1224
01:16:59,366 --> 01:17:01,701
before he takes it all away, and I

1225
01:17:03,453 --> 01:17:07,791
cannot go back to sitting
at a goddamn desk. I can't.

1226
01:17:08,125 --> 01:17:09,960
Aye. Listen...

1227
01:17:10,043 --> 01:17:12,295
No one can take it away from you.

1228
01:17:12,379 --> 01:17:13,588
Not all of it.

1229
01:17:13,713 --> 01:17:15,674
Whatever happens, you'll have me.

1230
01:17:16,216 --> 01:17:19,386
That's a very nice thing to say, but...

1231
01:17:19,553 --> 01:17:20,720
But what?

1232
01:17:32,607 --> 01:17:36,403
<i>Following a fatal traffic accident
involving a coalition truck,</i>

1233
01:17:36,486 --> 01:17:37,737
<i>long simmering frustration</i>

1234
01:17:37,863 --> 01:17:41,408
<i>today boiled over
into violence and despair.</i>

1235
01:17:41,491 --> 01:17:42,909
<i>They kill us!</i>

1236
01:17:42,993 --> 01:17:44,995
<i>They kill us and they break our hearts!</i>

1237
01:17:45,078 --> 01:17:47,664
<i>And I also give this message
to President Hamid Karzai:</i>

1238
01:17:47,747 --> 01:17:50,167
<i>What the hell is happening here?</i>

1239
01:18:11,062 --> 01:18:13,064
Okay, I don't care
who the hell's in there. I'm Kim Baker.

1240
01:18:13,148 --> 01:18:15,692
Go on in, Kim. Jerry's expecting you.

1241
01:18:15,775 --> 01:18:18,195
Well, that's fucking unsatisfying.

1242
01:18:18,278 --> 01:18:20,989
- Can I take your bag?
- Yes. Please.

1243
01:18:22,115 --> 01:18:24,284
- Would you care for some water?
- Yes.

1244
01:18:35,503 --> 01:18:36,504
I should've Googled you.

1245
01:18:36,588 --> 01:18:39,674
I've been... I've been using
all the wrong swear words.

1246
01:18:41,635 --> 01:18:43,720
Well, I hope
I didn't ruin your big moment.

1247
01:18:43,803 --> 01:18:46,556
Look, Geri, I don't know what
Tucker has been telling you.

1248
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:49,059
He said that you're upset
about the air time you're getting.

1249
01:18:49,142 --> 01:18:52,437
That's just wrong,
because this is not about me.

1250
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:56,650
My frustration is with our priorities
and what's best for the network.

1251
01:18:57,484 --> 01:18:59,986
Isn't deciding what's best
for the network my job?

1252
01:19:01,821 --> 01:19:03,156
I'm just saying,

1253
01:19:03,823 --> 01:19:06,201
as journalists, we have
an obligation to this story.

1254
01:19:06,284 --> 01:19:09,829
And Afghanistan should be
on our air more, period.

1255
01:19:09,913 --> 01:19:11,581
With the resources we have over there,

1256
01:19:11,665 --> 01:19:14,167
Afghanistan should definitely
be on our air more.

1257
01:19:14,251 --> 01:19:18,380
But the problem is, as much as
everyone loves the troops,

1258
01:19:18,463 --> 01:19:21,883
they don't actually want to watch them
on the news anymore.

1259
01:19:21,967 --> 01:19:23,134
They just don't.

1260
01:19:23,426 --> 01:19:26,221
So I can't give Afghanistan more air.

1261
01:19:26,304 --> 01:19:30,267
Which means I need to give
Afghanistan fewer resources.

1262
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:32,852
That's what's best for the network.

1263
01:19:33,770 --> 01:19:35,855
- Geri...
- You have that call now.

1264
01:19:38,942 --> 01:19:40,443
I'm not trying to be a bitch.

1265
01:19:40,527 --> 01:19:41,695
Okay, let me pitch you something.

1266
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:43,029
All right, the Chinese
mining concession...

1267
01:19:43,113 --> 01:19:44,114
<i>Jesus).!</i>

1268
01:19:44,197 --> 01:19:45,448
Look, the last person
who got any kind of

1269
01:19:45,532 --> 01:19:47,117
bounce out of Afghanistan

1270
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:48,952
was your friend Tanya Vanderpoel.

1271
01:19:49,035 --> 01:19:52,372
She's actually got me over a barrel
thanks to that drone story.

1272
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:54,207
What do you mean, "over a barrel"?

1273
01:19:54,291 --> 01:19:55,625
She's London, Kim.

1274
01:19:57,377 --> 01:19:59,337
- You're hiring Tanya.
- Yes.

1275
01:20:00,797 --> 01:20:02,590
I assumed you two flew here together.

1276
01:20:04,551 --> 01:20:05,885
She's here.

1277
01:20:08,972 --> 01:20:13,184
I'm sorry, you started talking
to her before the UAV strike?

1278
01:20:13,268 --> 01:20:14,811
Va
drone?

1279
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:18,064
Hello! Where are you going?

1280
01:20:18,398 --> 01:20:20,817
No, I'm only here for a few days.

1281
01:20:21,318 --> 01:20:22,819
Oh, I know.

1282
01:20:24,904 --> 01:20:26,031
Fuck.

1283
01:20:26,698 --> 01:20:28,283
I don't know what to say.

1284
01:20:28,408 --> 01:20:30,452
Ducky, I'm sorry. I fucked up.

1285
01:20:30,535 --> 01:20:32,078
Did you go to the Tribals

1286
01:20:32,203 --> 01:20:33,830
because you were
in a contract negotiation?

1287
01:20:33,913 --> 01:20:36,124
Dude, I'm not stealing your job, okay?

1288
01:20:36,207 --> 01:20:39,044
Tanya, this is not about my fucking job.

1289
01:20:40,211 --> 01:20:41,838
We have to make good calls, right?

1290
01:20:41,921 --> 01:20:44,758
And now Andy lost an eye
and Jaweed is dead.

1291
01:20:44,841 --> 01:20:47,469
Christ, man, we've both
fucking made mistakes!

1292
01:20:47,552 --> 01:20:50,597
No. Tell me you didn't go to the Tribals
because of a contract.

1293
01:20:51,765 --> 01:20:54,851
You would have done exactly what I did
if Jaweed had gone to you.

1294
01:20:54,934 --> 01:20:56,561
No. I'm not you.

1295
01:21:03,109 --> 01:21:05,111
Do you remember your first embed?

1296
01:21:06,446 --> 01:21:08,448
You interviewed a young Marine?

1297
01:21:08,573 --> 01:21:09,574
Coughlin? Yes. What?

1298
01:21:09,657 --> 01:21:13,161
Yeah, well, after they aired your story,

1299
01:21:13,244 --> 01:21:17,374
where you used his soundbite
about not loading his rifle,

1300
01:21:17,457 --> 01:21:19,417
they sent him to Helmand.

1301
01:21:20,126 --> 01:21:22,128
And he got his legs blown off.

1302
01:21:23,088 --> 01:21:24,422
So I hear.

1303
01:21:30,053 --> 01:21:31,554
See you in Kabul.

1304
01:22:01,751 --> 01:22:04,671
<i>Pm not really surprised
she chased the story.</i>

1305
01:22:04,838 --> 01:22:06,548
That's what we do. That's what you do.

1306
01:22:06,631 --> 01:22:07,674
I would do it.

1307
01:22:10,677 --> 01:22:12,178
Sorry.

1308
01:22:12,345 --> 01:22:15,014
Goddamn it, I'm tired.

1309
01:22:15,098 --> 01:22:16,391
You booked your return yet?

1310
01:22:16,474 --> 01:22:18,268
'Cause you could come through
Glasgow if you wanted.

1311
01:22:18,351 --> 01:22:19,310
<i>- I'll meet you.
- What?</i>

1312
01:22:19,394 --> 01:22:21,104
No. What about Badakhshan?

1313
01:22:21,187 --> 01:22:22,730
Badakhshan, that will keep

1314
01:22:22,814 --> 01:22:25,275
because the fucking pass
is still snowed in.

1315
01:22:25,358 --> 01:22:28,111
I need that story. I need a hit, all right?

1316
01:22:28,194 --> 01:22:30,321
I need something
so that Geri doesn't decide

1317
01:22:30,405 --> 01:22:32,699
I'm more useful as an ottoman
in her fucking office.

1318
01:22:32,782 --> 01:22:35,702
What you need, Kim,
is some time out of the bubble.

1319
01:22:35,785 --> 01:22:38,204
<i>You'd better get ready.
I'm fucking making love to you</i>

1320
01:22:38,288 --> 01:22:41,207
to bagpipe versions of Sade songs.

1321
01:22:43,376 --> 01:22:44,627
Yeah, okay.

1322
01:22:44,711 --> 01:22:46,504
Really? You'll meet me in Glasgow?

1323
01:22:47,297 --> 01:22:49,799
Yeah, I'll meet you in Glasgow.

1324
01:22:49,883 --> 01:22:51,509
<i>- I'll get the next flight.
- Okay.</i>

1325
01:22:51,885 --> 01:22:53,887
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>

1326
01:23:03,563 --> 01:23:04,731
Hey, Antoine.

1327
01:23:04,814 --> 01:23:07,692
Where have you come from?
I thought you were in Badakhshan.

1328
01:23:08,067 --> 01:23:10,904
I was. Drove back overnight.

1329
01:23:10,987 --> 01:23:14,824
- Wait, what? The pass is open?
<i>- Oui.</i> For now.

1330
01:23:29,005 --> 01:23:30,089
Cheers.

1331
01:23:51,444 --> 01:23:52,779
Oh, Christ.

1332
01:23:55,782 --> 01:23:56,824
Excuse me.

1333
01:23:58,660 --> 01:23:59,702
Kunduz near?

1334
01:24:00,078 --> 01:24:01,120
Far?

1335
01:24:06,417 --> 01:24:08,836
I'd like to rent a car.

1336
01:24:15,051 --> 01:24:16,386
Aye, thank you.

1337
01:24:16,511 --> 01:24:18,972
Yeah, I get it. Thank you. Thanks a lot.

1338
01:24:43,246 --> 01:24:44,914
<i>Oh, Jesus.</i>

1339
01:24:45,498 --> 01:24:47,166
Oh, shit.

1340
01:24:56,175 --> 01:24:58,511
<i>Welcome to
Glasgow International Airport.</i>

1341
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:02,432
<i>Outside temperatures
18 degrees Celsius.</i>

1342
01:25:02,515 --> 01:25:04,601
<i>Local time is 15 hours.</i>

1343
01:25:04,684 --> 01:25:07,520
<i>There will be an airline representative
to assist you to your luggage.</i>

1344
01:25:07,604 --> 01:25:09,731
<i>Once again, thank you
for flying with us...</i>

1345
01:25:11,065 --> 01:25:12,609
Oh, my God.

1346
01:25:25,121 --> 01:25:26,414
Leaving a message for Susan.

1347
01:25:26,497 --> 01:25:28,625
Woodward, I'm back in Kabul again.

1348
01:25:28,708 --> 01:25:31,294
I'm trying to get information about
the disappearance of lain MacKelpie,

1349
01:25:31,377 --> 01:25:33,504
so if someone at Reuters
can please call me back.

1350
01:25:33,588 --> 01:25:35,381
Call to let me know
that you've received this message.

1351
01:25:35,465 --> 01:25:36,674
Thank you.

1352
01:25:53,733 --> 01:25:55,943
Who kidnaps a Scottish
freelance photographer?

1353
01:25:56,027 --> 01:25:58,196
The whole point of kidnapping
is to get money, right?

1354
01:25:58,279 --> 01:25:59,489
As far as I understand,

1355
01:25:59,572 --> 01:26:01,491
lain was just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

1356
01:26:01,574 --> 01:26:04,369
Can this half-assed country
not even do kidnapping right?

1357
01:26:04,452 --> 01:26:07,455
ISAF does not think this was
an upper-tier organization.

1358
01:26:07,538 --> 01:26:10,333
So these men will probably try
to sell him to someone else.

1359
01:26:10,416 --> 01:26:13,544
And then there will be some talking,
you know.

1360
01:26:13,628 --> 01:26:15,963
Oh, my God, Fahim.
They're gonna kill him.

1361
01:26:16,589 --> 01:26:18,341
No, they will not, Kim,

1362
01:26:18,424 --> 01:26:19,842
<i>inshallah.</i>

1363
01:26:22,136 --> 01:26:25,390
Now is when you're supposed
to say "I told you so".

1364
01:26:35,149 --> 01:26:36,442
Fuck!

1365
01:26:44,659 --> 01:26:47,954
Ramadan has ended.
They are slaughtering lambs.

1366
01:27:07,974 --> 01:27:10,143
- May I speak with him?
- The general's busy.

1367
01:27:14,105 --> 01:27:16,107
Really, General? The elliptical?

1368
01:27:16,649 --> 01:27:18,443
I have bad knees.

1369
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:23,865
I'm guessing you didn't come
here for the smell of balls.

1370
01:27:23,948 --> 01:27:25,908
Everybody get the fuck out!

1371
01:27:31,497 --> 01:27:33,332
They believe that
he may have been sold

1372
01:27:33,416 --> 01:27:34,959
to another organization

1373
01:27:35,042 --> 01:27:36,878
somewhere in that same region.

1374
01:27:41,007 --> 01:27:43,217
That's a pretty big ask, Baker.

1375
01:27:44,844 --> 01:27:47,013
There's a real-time clock on this.

1376
01:27:48,598 --> 01:27:50,516
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

1377
01:27:59,233 --> 01:28:01,360
You know, it's just a shame that

1378
01:28:01,444 --> 01:28:05,114
y'all don't get credit for all these
high-profile things that you do.

1379
01:28:05,198 --> 01:28:07,700
You know, especially with
SEALs and Delta out there.

1380
01:28:07,784 --> 01:28:09,035
I mean, what week goes by
they don't see

1381
01:28:09,118 --> 01:28:11,454
those assholes on TV, am I right?

1382
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:16,334
And then next time Congress votes
on a Pentagon budget

1383
01:28:16,417 --> 01:28:20,087
and there's this pesky little
10% line item for the Marines,

1384
01:28:20,171 --> 01:28:23,216
next thing you know,
you guys are just part of the Navy.

1385
01:28:23,299 --> 01:28:25,009
Although, sir,
you would look spectacular

1386
01:28:25,092 --> 01:28:26,928
in one of those pretty white uniforms.

1387
01:28:31,766 --> 01:28:33,100
God, you know what?

1388
01:28:34,227 --> 01:28:36,646
It's just occurring to me
that, unlike JSOC,

1389
01:28:36,729 --> 01:28:38,940
you guys allow reporter embeds.

1390
01:28:39,065 --> 01:28:42,902
Which means that a cameraman
could go on a FORECON mission.

1391
01:28:43,569 --> 01:28:46,614
Don't you think that would be
great for the Corps, sir?

1392
01:28:47,073 --> 01:28:48,908
That kind of exposure?

1393
01:28:50,451 --> 01:28:51,953
Pretty good for you, too.

1394
01:28:53,579 --> 01:28:55,206
Look, we don't go in blind.

1395
01:28:55,289 --> 01:28:57,708
We have to know what we're
doing and where we're going.

1396
01:28:57,792 --> 01:28:59,210
It's the way we work.

1397
01:28:59,293 --> 01:29:01,963
We're not likely to get an address, but...

1398
01:29:02,046 --> 01:29:04,966
When you have something concrete,
come back and we'll get kinetic.

1399
01:29:15,768 --> 01:29:19,522
Please tell Mr. Sadiq
that his "special friend" is here.

1400
01:29:19,605 --> 01:29:21,983
What can I get for you?
Some tea? The new PlayStation?

1401
01:29:22,066 --> 01:29:24,944
No, thank you. I just need
a moment of your time.

1402
01:29:27,530 --> 01:29:29,115
We still friends, Sadiq?

1403
01:29:29,198 --> 01:29:32,285
Well, that is up to you, Kim.

1404
01:29:32,368 --> 01:29:34,203
Because you once told me

1405
01:29:34,287 --> 01:29:37,039
that nothing happens here
that you don't know about.

1406
01:29:37,123 --> 01:29:41,335
So you must know about my friend
lain MacKelpie getting kidnapped.

1407
01:29:41,419 --> 01:29:42,461
I did hear about this, yes.

1408
01:29:42,545 --> 01:29:43,754
Yeah, well, everybody heard about it,

1409
01:29:43,838 --> 01:29:48,301
but a powerful man such as yourself
must actually know something.

1410
01:29:48,384 --> 01:29:50,511
Or your friend Pacha Khan
knows something.

1411
01:29:50,595 --> 01:29:53,139
- Or his friend does.
- Of course.

1412
01:29:53,222 --> 01:29:56,225
I could make some inquiries,
but I can only do this

1413
01:29:56,309 --> 01:29:58,477
for a very special friend.

1414
01:30:17,163 --> 01:30:19,999
I have a video that I think
you should watch, Sadiq.

1415
01:30:20,082 --> 01:30:22,585
You push the little triangle.

1416
01:30:23,753 --> 01:30:26,088
You can watch video on the phone?

1417
01:30:29,842 --> 01:30:31,010
What is this?

1418
01:30:32,595 --> 01:30:36,515
It looks like the Attorney General
of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan

1419
01:30:36,599 --> 01:30:37,892
dancing in the street

1420
01:30:38,017 --> 01:30:40,353
with a Western enemy of Islam

1421
01:30:40,436 --> 01:30:42,355
at a party where alcohol was served.

1422
01:30:43,439 --> 01:30:44,941
I've never touched alcohol in my life!

1423
01:30:45,024 --> 01:30:46,943
Well, I'm just saying how it looks.

1424
01:30:54,951 --> 01:30:56,869
It's a good idea, right?

1425
01:30:57,870 --> 01:30:59,705
It's a great idea!

1426
01:31:00,539 --> 01:31:01,666
It's fucking ace!

1427
01:31:04,377 --> 01:31:05,878
Good on ya, Kim!

1428
01:31:07,755 --> 01:31:11,008
Let's go, load up!
Let's go, move, move, move!

1429
01:31:24,146 --> 01:31:26,816
You drink Tennessee whiskey,
Miss Baker?

1430
01:31:27,984 --> 01:31:28,985
Yeah.

1431
01:31:31,612 --> 01:31:33,114
Outstanding.

1432
01:33:20,262 --> 01:33:21,889
Tall Brian? What the fuck?

1433
01:33:35,194 --> 01:33:37,196
Hang tight, sir.
I'm gonna get you that ride.

1434
01:33:37,279 --> 01:33:38,739
Thank you.

1435
01:33:43,119 --> 01:33:45,621
What happened
to the army, Dr. Brydon?

1436
01:33:48,541 --> 01:33:50,042
I am the army.

1437
01:33:55,214 --> 01:33:56,882
Thank you, Kim.

1438
01:33:56,966 --> 01:33:58,217
How are you?

1439
01:33:58,676 --> 01:33:59,844
I've had worse kidnappings.

1440
01:34:03,722 --> 01:34:04,807
<i>MacKelpie is being
treated for minor injuries.</i>

1441
01:34:06,267 --> 01:34:07,977
<i>Again, this incredible footage</i>

1442
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:09,937
<i>was produced
by our very own Kim Baker.</i>

1443
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:12,314
<i>Just incredible. Way to go, Kim!</i>

1444
01:34:13,399 --> 01:34:17,027
If you want to kidnap someone
fucking twice,

1445
01:34:17,111 --> 01:34:18,112
you do a Toyota.

1446
01:34:18,195 --> 01:34:21,866
Fucking not as interesting as it got
when they fucking pulled out a burqa.

1447
01:34:21,949 --> 01:34:23,534
It's too fucking long for me!

1448
01:34:23,617 --> 01:34:25,202
I don't know who
the woman was it belonged to.

1449
01:34:25,286 --> 01:34:26,871
I'm not fucking 6'2", right?

1450
01:34:26,954 --> 01:34:29,915
I'm dragging this fucking thing along,
thinking the only consolation is,

1451
01:34:29,999 --> 01:34:32,126
at least if I'm a fucking woman,

1452
01:34:32,209 --> 01:34:34,920
I'm not gonna get buggered,
you know what I'm saying?

1453
01:34:41,594 --> 01:34:43,762
So anyway, I took
a little something, actually.

1454
01:34:43,846 --> 01:34:45,347
I went to the gift shop at Taliban.

1455
01:34:45,431 --> 01:34:46,682
I'm afraid all I could get

1456
01:34:46,849 --> 01:34:48,350
was that.

1457
01:35:12,458 --> 01:35:14,084
It's a shame you're going.

1458
01:35:15,127 --> 01:35:19,256
Well, I hope at least they're
flying you first class.

1459
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:22,051
Geri doesn't like me that much.
But she does like me now,

1460
01:35:22,134 --> 01:35:24,345
so while I have this juice,

1461
01:35:24,470 --> 01:35:26,180
I've got to leverage it
into something better.

1462
01:35:26,263 --> 01:35:27,514
Yes!

1463
01:35:27,598 --> 01:35:28,891
Yes, wait, Iraq.

1464
01:35:28,974 --> 01:35:30,601
I'll come with you.

1465
01:35:30,684 --> 01:35:33,479
No, actually, Pakistan.
That's where the real shooting shit is.

1466
01:35:33,562 --> 01:35:34,813
It's like the Wild West out there.

1467
01:35:34,897 --> 01:35:37,816
Actually, I told Geri
that I want New York or D.C.

1468
01:35:43,030 --> 01:35:44,281
No, I did.

1469
01:35:45,574 --> 01:35:46,951
No, really, where are you going?

1470
01:35:47,034 --> 01:35:48,452
New York or D.C.

1471
01:35:50,537 --> 01:35:51,664
Why?

1472
01:35:53,290 --> 01:35:55,000
You can still come with me.

1473
01:36:01,548 --> 01:36:03,467
Because I think
there's plenty of good work

1474
01:36:03,550 --> 01:36:05,010
to be done in the real world,

1475
01:36:05,094 --> 01:36:07,137
and the Kabubble is well-established.

1476
01:36:07,221 --> 01:36:09,848
Is this about me going
to Badakhshan without you?

1477
01:36:09,932 --> 01:36:12,476
'Cause you would have done
exactly the same thing.

1478
01:36:12,559 --> 01:36:14,436
And, hey, what, I forgive you!

1479
01:36:17,523 --> 01:36:19,191
This is not about you.

1480
01:36:19,316 --> 01:36:21,944
It's not about Badakhshan, or Glasgow,

1481
01:36:22,027 --> 01:36:23,946
or the cottage with the chickens.

1482
01:36:25,072 --> 01:36:26,198
What chickens?

1483
01:36:33,330 --> 01:36:35,124
It's okay. I know you're not gonna come.

1484
01:36:39,503 --> 01:36:41,380
I just have to get out of here
before it's too late.

1485
01:36:43,007 --> 01:36:44,341
What do you mean?

1486
01:36:46,427 --> 01:36:48,595
I started to feel like this was normal.

1487
01:36:51,682 --> 01:36:53,517
You know it's not, right?

1488
01:37:10,826 --> 01:37:12,494
Come to New York and get it.

1489
01:37:13,746 --> 01:37:16,582
Remember, you're like a six
in Manhattan.

1490
01:37:49,698 --> 01:37:51,200
How's your baby?

1491
01:37:51,950 --> 01:37:53,202
Which one?

1492
01:37:53,786 --> 01:37:55,704
- You have two?
- Yes.

1493
01:37:57,790 --> 01:37:59,708
Irish twins.

1494
01:38:01,627 --> 01:38:04,296
No, they are very good.

1495
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:07,132
The younger one, the boy,
he's very strong.

1496
01:38:08,884 --> 01:38:10,886
I bet the girl is strong, too.

1497
01:38:10,969 --> 01:38:12,304
She's stronger.

1498
01:38:41,667 --> 01:38:43,335
So,

1499
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:47,339
those men in the hospital, the addicts...

1500
01:38:49,049 --> 01:38:51,093
Any of them ever get better?

1501
01:38:51,176 --> 01:38:53,846
Have a happy ending?

1502
01:39:05,441 --> 01:39:08,444
In my culture, we would hug.

1503
01:40:33,278 --> 01:40:34,363
Hey.

1504
01:40:35,614 --> 01:40:37,449
<i>You know, I miss it. The Stan.</i>

1505
01:40:38,033 --> 01:40:39,451
Yeah, I miss it, too.

1506
01:40:39,535 --> 01:40:41,620
Actually, I tried to go back

1507
01:40:42,621 --> 01:40:44,289
but even the Army wouldn't take me.

1508
01:40:44,957 --> 01:40:48,001
I mean, the Army!
I mean, that's just hurtful.

1509
01:40:51,213 --> 01:40:54,049
Well, I'm very sorry
for what happened to you.

1510
01:40:54,132 --> 01:40:56,969
So if there's anything
that you want to say to me,

1511
01:40:57,052 --> 01:40:58,053
that's why I'm here.

1512
01:40:58,387 --> 01:41:00,055
That's why I came here.

1513
01:41:00,430 --> 01:41:01,473
Ma'am,

1514
01:41:03,267 --> 01:41:06,812
I lost my legs because of an IED,
not because of you.

1515
01:41:09,064 --> 01:41:11,233
I appreciate that,
but if I hadn't quoted you,

1516
01:41:11,316 --> 01:41:13,652
you wouldn't have been transferred.

1517
01:41:13,819 --> 01:41:15,529
No, really, you can say
whatever you want to me.

1518
01:41:15,612 --> 01:41:16,655
That's why I'm here.

1519
01:41:16,738 --> 01:41:18,031
Okay, well, then let's say you're right.

1520
01:41:18,115 --> 01:41:19,199
It's still not 'cause of you, ma'am.

1521
01:41:19,658 --> 01:41:23,829
Some 12-year-old haji
had to plant that bomb.

1522
01:41:23,912 --> 01:41:26,707
And, hell, you know,
if Bin Laden's parents

1523
01:41:26,790 --> 01:41:28,083
hadn't have gotten divorced,

1524
01:41:28,166 --> 01:41:31,086
maybe none of us would've been
in the Stan to begin with.

1525
01:41:33,005 --> 01:41:36,550
And the Taliban, they wouldn't
have even been there for UBL

1526
01:41:36,633 --> 01:41:39,261
if Brezhnev hadn't have gone
and fouled up Afghanistan

1527
01:41:39,344 --> 01:41:40,846
in the first place.

1528
01:41:41,763 --> 01:41:45,350
And the British Empire. Yeah.

1529
01:41:45,434 --> 01:41:46,602
And Kim Baker.

1530
01:41:46,685 --> 01:41:48,145
Okay, I deserve that.

1531
01:41:49,396 --> 01:41:53,650
Goddamn! Once you got no legs,
everyone takes everything so serious.

1532
01:41:54,985 --> 01:41:58,780
I mean, there's only so much
any of us have any control of,

1533
01:41:59,531 --> 01:42:02,117
good or bad.

1534
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:05,370
If you didn't learn that in Afghanistan,
you were not paying attention.

1535
01:42:05,454 --> 01:42:07,664
So, you're not gonna yell at me?

1536
01:42:07,748 --> 01:42:10,083
I mean, ma'am...

1537
01:42:11,877 --> 01:42:13,629
Kim, you've got to move on.

1538
01:42:15,130 --> 01:42:17,215
You're giving yourself
way too much credit.

1539
01:42:17,966 --> 01:42:19,885
You embrace the suck,

1540
01:42:21,053 --> 01:42:23,055
you move the fuck forward.

1541
01:42:29,144 --> 01:42:31,396
What other fucking choice do we have?

1542
01:42:35,233 --> 01:42:36,568
Do I hear swearing over there?

1543
01:42:37,486 --> 01:42:39,988
How are you standing there
the one time I curse?

1544
01:42:40,072 --> 01:42:41,114
-"One time".
- I mean...

1545
01:42:41,198 --> 01:42:43,158
It's true. He had a good
long run in the military.

1546
01:42:43,241 --> 01:42:45,118
Don't cover up for him.

1547
01:42:45,827 --> 01:42:46,995
So, Kim, are you gonna stay for dinner?

1548
01:42:47,079 --> 01:42:48,830
Of course she will.

1549
01:43:09,768 --> 01:43:10,936
Bye!

1550
01:43:11,853 --> 01:43:15,023
Say bye to Kim. Say bye. Bye, Kim!

1551
01:43:35,127 --> 01:43:37,629
<i>Colonel, the Afghan
National Army missed</i>

1552
01:43:37,713 --> 01:43:39,214
<i>yet another benchmark
for preparedness.</i>

1553
01:43:39,297 --> 01:43:42,300
