1
00:00:03,574 --> 00:00:05,341
You almost died.
Yes.

2
00:00:05,342 --> 00:00:06,443
Don't do it again.

3
00:00:06,444 --> 00:00:08,177
Previously on "Scandal"...

4
00:00:08,178 --> 00:00:09,246
what do you want?
I want a divorce.

5
00:00:09,247 --> 00:00:11,046
I would like to marry you.

6
00:00:11,047 --> 00:00:13,515
Whatever's wrong, don't say
you're marrying Edison.

7
00:00:13,516 --> 00:00:15,049
You're willing to bring down
the whole Republic

8
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,019
'cause you feel guilty!

9
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,620
And if what we did gets out?

10
00:00:17,621 --> 00:00:19,989
Then it gets out,
and we are brought to justice.

11
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,624
You are not the president.

12
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:23,993
Hollis Doyle rigged the voting machines.

13
00:00:23,994 --> 00:00:25,529
It's a go.
We all helped cover it up.

14
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,164
Mellie? Cyrus? Olivia?

15
00:00:28,165 --> 00:00:30,466
I told Edison I wouldn't marry him.

16
00:00:30,467 --> 00:00:32,101
I changed my mind about that.

17
00:00:32,102 --> 00:00:34,070
What?
Don't wait for me.

18

19
00:01:21,985 --> 00:01:24,286
Honey, I'm back.

20
00:01:24,287 --> 00:01:26,021
Do you have it?

21
00:01:26,022 --> 00:01:27,623
It's 7:00 in the morning.

22
00:01:27,624 --> 00:01:30,125
Do you have it or not?

23
00:01:30,126 --> 00:01:31,227
Yes.

24
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:37,467
You didn't sleep at all
last night. Maybe you should--

25
00:01:37,468 --> 00:01:38,934
don't.

26
00:01:38,935 --> 00:01:41,338
Okay.

27
00:02:06,263 --> 00:02:08,531
What are you doing?

28
00:02:08,532 --> 00:02:11,300
I thought you could use
a little morning pick-me-up.

29
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:13,469
Mellie--
Shh.

30
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,237
You don't have to do anything.

31
00:02:15,238 --> 00:02:16,906
I'll do all the work.

32
00:02:16,907 --> 00:02:18,240
Mellie...

33
00:02:32,522 --> 00:02:34,924
Ignore it.

34
00:02:36,226 --> 00:02:38,460
Yes?!

35
00:02:38,461 --> 00:02:40,062
Mr. President?

36
00:02:41,498 --> 00:02:43,198
Cyrus, you're in my bathroom.

37
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,967
Yes, sir, Mr. President.

38
00:02:44,968 --> 00:02:46,436
I'm as unhappy about that as you are.

39
00:02:46,437 --> 00:02:49,538
I sent two aides, and neither
had the courage to knock.

40
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:50,540
Sir?

41
00:02:51,608 --> 00:02:54,543
Hi, Cyrus.

42
00:02:54,544 --> 00:02:57,179
Good morning... ma'am.

43
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,481
A-All set for
the christening tomorrow?

44
00:02:59,482 --> 00:03:02,918
Yes. Thank you. Sir?

45
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,987
You have bad news.

46
00:03:04,988 --> 00:03:06,923
Four Americans have been
kidnapped abroad.

47
00:03:25,342 --> 00:03:26,875
Oh, God.

48
00:03:26,876 --> 00:03:28,612
Oh, God.

49
00:03:31,514 --> 00:03:34,017
Oh, God, Oh, God, oh, God.

50
00:03:35,185 --> 00:03:36,919
Mr. Rosen? Police!

51
00:03:46,096 --> 00:03:47,496
Mr. Rosen?

52
00:03:47,497 --> 00:03:49,431
Be right there!

53
00:03:49,432 --> 00:03:51,200
Mr. Rosen?

54
00:03:51,201 --> 00:03:52,969
I'm officer Drew.
This is officer Bristol.

55
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,404
Hello. Hi. Uh, I'm sorry.

56
00:03:55,405 --> 00:03:56,640
Took a second to answer the door.

57
00:03:56,641 --> 00:03:59,608
I had to, uh, throw some pants on.

58
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:01,577
Anyway, what can I do for you?

59
00:04:01,578 --> 00:04:03,612
We got a call
from one of your neighbors.

60
00:04:03,613 --> 00:04:05,482
Said they heard a disturbance
coming from your place.

61
00:04:05,483 --> 00:04:08,017
Really? No, uh...
not that I--

62
00:04:08,018 --> 00:04:10,052
No. I don't--

63
00:04:10,053 --> 00:04:12,054
what kind of disturbance?

64
00:04:12,055 --> 00:04:14,256
A woman screaming.
A fight of some sort.

65
00:04:14,257 --> 00:04:17,660
No. No. Uh, no fight.
Uh...

66
00:04:17,661 --> 00:04:19,528
maybe the TV was on too loud.

67
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:20,929
I don't hear the TV.

68
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,332
I turned it off
when I heard you knocking.

69
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,868
No one else was here last night
or early this morning?

70
00:04:25,869 --> 00:04:28,404
Just you?
Yep. Yep. Uh-huh.

71
00:04:28,405 --> 00:04:30,973
Just me. I-I live alone.

72
00:04:30,974 --> 00:04:34,143
All right, Mr. Rosen.
Thank you for your time.

73
00:04:34,144 --> 00:04:37,147
I will be sure to keep the TV down.

74
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,569
This tape arrived at our embassy
in Kashfar an hour ago.

75
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,571
"Head up.
Look into the camera."

76
00:05:02,572 --> 00:05:04,372
The guys with the guns are
Kashfar liberation front,

77
00:05:04,373 --> 00:05:06,274
a local terror group
affiliated with Al Qaeda.

78
00:05:06,275 --> 00:05:07,909
Most of them can't even read the koran.

79
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,612
Thugs with an excuse to wreak havoc.

80
00:05:09,613 --> 00:05:10,979
"tell them what you are.

81
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,615
Tell them what agency
you work for."

82
00:05:12,616 --> 00:05:14,183
what do they want?

83
00:05:14,184 --> 00:05:15,616
The release of Moktada Al Far.

84
00:05:15,617 --> 00:05:17,587
Local Leader, picked up
last year, now in Gitmo.

85
00:05:17,588 --> 00:05:20,255
We don't negotiate with
terrorists. They know that.

86
00:05:20,256 --> 00:05:22,559
"speak into the camera, you bitch."

87
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,426
If he's not released in 48 hours,

88
00:05:24,427 --> 00:05:26,394
they say they'll start shooting
these guys, one per day.

89
00:05:26,395 --> 00:05:27,595
What's he saying?

90
00:05:27,596 --> 00:05:29,430
"Speak, you godless American whore.

91
00:05:29,431 --> 00:05:30,667
Tell them who you work for." I work
for the international red cross.

92
00:05:30,668 --> 00:05:32,901
I was delivering medical supplies.

93
00:05:36,406 --> 00:05:37,574
What about the family?

94
00:05:37,575 --> 00:05:39,274
We're waiting on that, sir.

95
00:05:39,275 --> 00:05:41,477
They deserve to know.
What are we waiting for?

96
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:43,512
It's complicated.
And why is that?

97
00:05:43,513 --> 00:05:45,280
Because they're ours, sir.

98
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:47,050
Are you saying that they're spies?

99
00:05:47,051 --> 00:05:50,285
They're our top C.I.A. assets
in the region, Mr. President.

100
00:05:50,286 --> 00:05:52,921
You want to tell me how these
two-bit junior Jihadis

101
00:05:52,922 --> 00:05:55,057
got their hands
on legitimate U.S. operatives?

102
00:05:55,058 --> 00:05:57,560
We don't know--
Well, find the hell out!

103
00:06:00,496 --> 00:06:02,632
I'd like a large coffee
and a bran muffin, please.

104
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:03,665
Okay.

105
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,567
No. Make that banana nut.

106
00:06:05,568 --> 00:06:08,070
Ah, hell, make it a doughnut.

107
00:06:08,071 --> 00:06:09,605
Ooh.

108
00:06:09,606 --> 00:06:11,640
Sorry about that.

109
00:06:11,641 --> 00:06:15,410
Is it okay? Did I, uh...
I short-circuit your life?

110
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:18,647
My life is
still intact. Thank you.

111
00:06:18,648 --> 00:06:20,549
Good. Well,
how about a doughnut?

112
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,050
The doughnuts here are amazing.

113
00:06:22,051 --> 00:06:24,653
They are the unsung heroes
of the pastry case.

114
00:06:24,654 --> 00:06:27,390
I'm good. Thank you.
Sure.

115
00:06:30,393 --> 00:06:31,894
So, what do you do?

116
00:06:33,396 --> 00:06:35,464
Okay, come on.

117
00:06:35,465 --> 00:06:36,933
Top-Secret
government official?

118
00:06:36,934 --> 00:06:39,034
C.I.A.? N.S.A.?

119
00:06:39,035 --> 00:06:40,268
You know, this place
is like a--

120
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:42,172
like a "who's who?"
of high-powered D.C.

121
00:06:42,173 --> 00:06:45,507
Once, I saw the vice president
take someone else's latte.

122
00:06:45,508 --> 00:06:47,075
I did.

123
00:06:47,076 --> 00:06:48,277
Not cool.

124
00:06:48,278 --> 00:06:50,379
What do you do?

125
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,147
Me? Nothing.

126
00:06:52,148 --> 00:06:53,515
I sell office supplies.

127
00:06:53,516 --> 00:06:55,951
No, you don't.
Sure, I do. Yeah.

128
00:06:55,952 --> 00:06:58,288
I can get you a great deal
on, uh, protractors in bulk.

129
00:06:58,289 --> 00:06:59,955
Hmm.

130
00:06:59,956 --> 00:07:01,456
I'm a tour guide.

131
00:07:01,457 --> 00:07:03,559
Up on that double-Decker
bus all day.

132
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,593
Did you know there's a typo
in the inaugural address

133
00:07:05,594 --> 00:07:07,497
on the right wall
of the Lincoln memorial?

134
00:07:07,498 --> 00:07:08,664
Mnh.
Mm.

135
00:07:08,665 --> 00:07:10,933
That is a very impressive
fake job you have.

136
00:07:10,934 --> 00:07:12,901
Likewise.

137
00:07:18,508 --> 00:07:20,642
Hello?

138
00:07:20,643 --> 00:07:23,912
David Rosen just called.
He's in trouble.

139
00:07:23,913 --> 00:07:26,148
Her name is Wendy.
Was Wendy.

140
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:27,584
Wendy Westerberg.
25 years old.

141
00:07:27,585 --> 00:07:30,485
Came to D.C. five years ago
from Allentown to attend G.W.

142
00:07:30,486 --> 00:07:33,155
Dropped out her junior year.
No social network presence.

143
00:07:33,156 --> 00:07:35,189
Where'd she work? So far
zero employment history.

144
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,490
But she lives on Mintwood Place.

145
00:07:36,491 --> 00:07:37,594
Rent's probably about 4 grand a month.

146
00:07:37,595 --> 00:07:39,328
Find out how she swings it.

147
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:41,629
Did you know her well? A little.
We hung out a few times.

148
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,566
She's a regular at Mcghee's on prospect.

149
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:45,133
Did you have sex with her?

150
00:07:45,134 --> 00:07:47,135
David, you need to tell me everything.

151
00:07:47,136 --> 00:07:48,471
Your life could depend on it.

152
00:07:48,472 --> 00:07:50,906
Yes, we had sex.

153
00:07:50,907 --> 00:07:53,442
It's the last thing
I remember before--

154
00:07:53,443 --> 00:07:55,277
I didn't kill her.

155
00:07:55,278 --> 00:07:56,410
I didn't kill her.

156
00:07:56,411 --> 00:07:57,513
What's David been up to?

157
00:07:57,514 --> 00:07:59,581
After losing his job
as an A.U.S.A.

158
00:07:59,582 --> 00:08:01,249
And being blackballed
by the justice department

159
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,486
due to a series of embarrassing
high-profile failures,

160
00:08:03,487 --> 00:08:06,154
Mr. Rosen knocked on just
about every door on k street

161
00:08:06,155 --> 00:08:07,455
and the hill looking for work.

162
00:08:07,456 --> 00:08:09,290
When none of those doors opened,
he tried forming

163
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,094
his own firm,
working out of his apartment.

164
00:08:11,095 --> 00:08:13,662
Made business cards and everything. Mm.

165
00:08:13,663 --> 00:08:16,498
I didn't even know they made,
uh, stock this thin.

166
00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:18,333
The phone never rang.

167
00:08:18,334 --> 00:08:19,635
Pupils are dilated.

168
00:08:19,636 --> 00:08:21,535
Also you see how they're
turned inward? Yeah.

169
00:08:21,536 --> 00:08:22,870
My pupils are turned inward?
You got roofied.

170
00:08:22,871 --> 00:08:24,307
I'd say seven, eight hours ago.

171
00:08:24,308 --> 00:08:27,009
No lividity or rigor mortis,
so Wendy here's pretty fresh.

172
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,077
I'd say she died an hour ago, maybe two.

173
00:08:29,078 --> 00:08:31,580
Oh, thank God. Thank God.
I knew I couldn't--

174
00:08:31,581 --> 00:08:32,980
are we moving her?
Moving her?!

175
00:08:32,981 --> 00:08:34,115
If we're moving her, we gotta move now.

176
00:08:34,116 --> 00:08:35,416
Moving her means
the killer might go free.

177
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:37,186
We're not moving her!
Everybody, hold on.

178
00:08:37,187 --> 00:08:38,954
David, you've been set up.

179
00:08:38,955 --> 00:08:40,388
Professionally, by the looks of it.

180
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:42,158
Now you tell me you lied to the police.

181
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,458
I panicked. I did.

182
00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:45,059
But I cannot tamper with a crime scene.

183
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,494
We can try to help you sell the truth,

184
00:08:46,495 --> 00:08:48,162
try to explain away
your lies to the cops,

185
00:08:48,163 --> 00:08:49,563
dead woman lying in your bed,

186
00:08:49,564 --> 00:08:51,434
but you have to ask yourself,
will the police believe you?

187
00:08:51,435 --> 00:08:53,535
Will they work overtime
getting to the bottom

188
00:08:53,536 --> 00:08:55,536
of this mystery, or will they
go for the easy arrest?

189
00:08:55,537 --> 00:08:57,238
But moving the body has its own risks.

190
00:08:57,239 --> 00:08:58,942
It's illegal, and it makes it
Harder for the police

191
00:08:58,943 --> 00:09:02,911
to find the real killer,
so tell us what you want.

192
00:09:02,912 --> 00:09:05,047
Either way,

193
00:09:05,048 --> 00:09:06,883
we'll help you fight this.

194
00:09:08,484 --> 00:09:10,619
Do it.

195
00:09:13,189 --> 00:09:14,555
You got her jewelry?
Electronics, too.

196
00:09:14,556 --> 00:09:15,589
Laptop?
No laptop.

197
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,226
She has one.
There's a power cord.

198
00:09:17,227 --> 00:09:19,561
I looked everywhere.
Fine. Break that lamp.

199
00:09:19,562 --> 00:09:21,497
Why? Needs to look like a "B" And "E."

200
00:09:21,498 --> 00:09:23,165
it won't throw off the examiners,

201
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,601
but it'll buy us more time with the cops.

202
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,504
What happens next?
You go to work.

203
00:09:29,505 --> 00:09:31,374
You have a job, right?
Yes, I have a job.

204
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,275
No thanks to any of you.

205
00:09:33,276 --> 00:09:34,610
Who can tell me

206
00:09:34,611 --> 00:09:37,446
the three branches of government?

207
00:09:37,447 --> 00:09:39,482
Anybody?

208
00:09:41,951 --> 00:09:44,120
How about just one?

209
00:09:47,156 --> 00:09:48,458
David's bank statements.

210
00:09:48,459 --> 00:09:50,625
There was only one recent
deposit, for $5,000.

211
00:09:50,626 --> 00:09:53,128
Who's Eugenia Bergman?
David's grandmother.

212
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:55,263
She paid his rent last month.

213
00:09:55,264 --> 00:09:57,366
We ruined David's life.

214
00:09:57,367 --> 00:09:59,202
So you go to your job
just like nothing ever happened,

215
00:09:59,203 --> 00:10:01,470
because, David...

216
00:10:01,471 --> 00:10:03,506
nothing happened.

217
00:10:05,074 --> 00:10:06,509
What are you looking for?

218
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,610
We need spatter for the sheets,
for the walls.

219
00:10:08,611 --> 00:10:10,313
We need fresh blood.

220
00:10:12,915 --> 00:10:15,484
Here.

221
00:10:15,485 --> 00:10:16,652
You said you wanted to learn cleanup.

222
00:10:16,653 --> 00:10:19,255
This is cleanup.

223
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,194
Wait! Eyes open.
You can't miss.

224
00:10:26,195 --> 00:10:27,363
She's already dead.

225
00:10:27,364 --> 00:10:30,099
It's not her I'm worried about.

226
00:10:35,471 --> 00:10:38,374
You're a natural.

227
00:10:52,926 --> 00:10:54,960
He's in a meeting. There's
nothing on the schedule.

228
00:10:54,961 --> 00:10:56,897
You think I make this
stuff up to amuse you?

229
00:10:56,898 --> 00:10:59,399
Louise, who's he meeting with?

230
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,402
Together we will resolve this crisis.

231
00:11:02,403 --> 00:11:04,537
And may we become
better friends in the process.

232
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,807
I didn't think that was
possible, Mr. Ambassador.

233
00:11:06,808 --> 00:11:08,808
Keep me posted.

234
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:10,010
You got--Thank you.

235
00:11:12,613 --> 00:11:14,880
You met the ambassador
to Kashfar without me, sir?

236
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:16,817
I saved you an hour
of your life--

237
00:11:16,818 --> 00:11:19,552
An hour I wasted trying to get
the Kashfaris to step up

238
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,420
and take responsibility
for their own security.

239
00:11:21,421 --> 00:11:22,723
You didn't want me in the meeting.

240
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,724
Can I help you with something?

241
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:27,761
Is there something we need to discuss?

242
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,366
You tell me, Cy.

243
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,938
I guess not.

244
00:11:42,943 --> 00:11:44,577
I'm in!

245
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:45,946
Wendy's cell was stolen at the scene,

246
00:11:45,947 --> 00:11:47,714
but I hacked into the cloud.

247
00:11:47,715 --> 00:11:49,681
There's nothing on her finances
yet, but it looks like

248
00:11:49,682 --> 00:11:51,717
she was uploading a bunch
of photos from her phone

249
00:11:51,718 --> 00:11:53,821
almost every night.
Okay, let's see 'em.

250
00:11:56,023 --> 00:11:57,725
Uh, these are a bunch
of pictures of, uh...

251
00:11:57,726 --> 00:11:59,993
men. Lots and lots
of naked--

252
00:11:59,994 --> 00:12:02,362
Hey.
She wasn't a fan of faces.

253
00:12:02,363 --> 00:12:03,862
If she was sleeping with all these guys,

254
00:12:03,863 --> 00:12:06,331
maybe one of them got jealous.
Is that's someone's--

255
00:12:06,332 --> 00:12:07,568
Hairy baby arm? No.

256
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:08,702
Abby.

257
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,638
Oh, right.

258
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:13,772
The good news is it doesn't
seem like we have to worry

259
00:12:13,773 --> 00:12:14,940
about any doormen or cabbies.

260
00:12:14,941 --> 00:12:16,708
Bad news?
The bartender at Mcghee's

261
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:18,977
definitely remembers Wendy and
that she left with David.

262
00:12:18,978 --> 00:12:20,679
Cops will be coming with a warrant.

263
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,347
Well, they won't find anything
at his place.

264
00:12:22,348 --> 00:12:23,749
We were thorough. How long till
they find her at her home?

265
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,719
Well, based on the ambient
temperature in her apartment,

266
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,620
two days, three Max.

267
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,689
I've got Quinn on surveillance.

268
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:30,923
She's good at it.

269
00:12:30,924 --> 00:12:32,726
So we have at least two days
to Figure out

270
00:12:32,727 --> 00:12:34,394
who all these men are

271
00:12:34,395 --> 00:12:35,996
and if any of them
might have wanted Wendy dead.

272
00:12:35,997 --> 00:12:37,997
She ordered Cable. Wendy
ordered Cable. What?

273
00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:41,400
Cable guy came.
Her neighbor left him in.

274
00:12:41,401 --> 00:12:43,070
So we just went from having
two days to find out

275
00:12:43,071 --> 00:12:45,805
who framed David...
to having two hours.

276
00:12:47,674 --> 00:12:49,610
It's like a puzzle.
A thousand-Piece puzzle.

277
00:12:49,611 --> 00:12:51,744
Of man parts.
We don't have time,

278
00:12:51,745 --> 00:12:53,280
we don't have names.
We don't have numbers.

279
00:12:53,281 --> 00:12:54,847
What do we have?
Location stamps.

280
00:12:54,848 --> 00:12:56,848
Huck can pin the location
where each photo was taken.

281
00:12:56,849 --> 00:12:58,717
We know where they live.
We know their names.

282
00:12:58,718 --> 00:13:00,485
Like this guy here--
Based on the location stamp

283
00:13:00,486 --> 00:13:01,753
of where the photo was taken

284
00:13:01,754 --> 00:13:03,424
and some spring break shots on Facebook,

285
00:13:03,425 --> 00:13:04,924
I'm gonna say he's Chase Coleman,

286
00:13:04,925 --> 00:13:06,658
bike messenger for beltway courier

287
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:09,027
until six months ago, when
clients' sensitive materials

288
00:13:09,028 --> 00:13:10,064
were leaked to the "times."

289
00:13:10,065 --> 00:13:11,664
Bitch put something in my drink.

290
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:12,898
Stole my messenger bag.

291
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:14,768
Next thing I know,
I can't get hired anywhere,

292
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:16,769
and I'm selling my bike.

293
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:19,739
Please take one. I have to
get rid of 500 by noon.

294
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,074
Jason Davies.

295
00:13:21,075 --> 00:13:22,675
Photo was snapped at a duplex.

296
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:26,279
The only other male resident
is a norm dinova, born 1928.

297
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,282
So unless old normy keeps
himself in Amazing shape...

298
00:13:29,283 --> 00:13:30,782
the sad thing is I actually thought

299
00:13:30,783 --> 00:13:32,686
we kinda had something,
and then two weeks

300
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,387
after we start bangin',

301
00:13:34,388 --> 00:13:36,456
my club's all over the frickin' news.

302
00:13:36,457 --> 00:13:38,290
Davies owns the Luna lounge
on 9th street.

303
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,325
They had that big drug bust
the "post" Broke last month.

304
00:13:40,326 --> 00:13:41,727
They've all had some kind of thing.

305
00:13:41,728 --> 00:13:43,362
That guy was connected
to the massage parlor bust.

306
00:13:43,363 --> 00:13:44,863
Ah, this is the guy that had an affair

307
00:13:44,864 --> 00:13:46,298
with his daughter's
best friend--

308
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:47,633
Congressional Aide, remember?

309
00:13:47,634 --> 00:13:49,036
Wendy wasn't just sleeping
with these guys.

310
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:51,904
She was digging up dirt, exposing secrets.
But... why?

311
00:13:51,905 --> 00:13:54,307
Yeah. I paid her
for some stories.

312
00:13:54,308 --> 00:13:57,910
I mean, what's a few g's for
seven front-Page bylines, huh?

313
00:13:57,911 --> 00:14:00,013
I am really sorry she's dead.

314
00:14:00,014 --> 00:14:01,714
Good source.

315
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,916
So Wendy--She's some kind
of story whore?

316
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:06,486
She targets men with access
to sensitive information,

317
00:14:06,487 --> 00:14:07,953
tries to get it out of them through sex.

318
00:14:07,954 --> 00:14:09,588
If that doesn't work, she roofies them,

319
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:11,523
digs for dirt herself, and sells
it to the highest bidder.

320
00:14:11,524 --> 00:14:13,759
Now we know how she made rent.
Huck says the cops

321
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,362
are at the bar talking to the bartender.

322
00:14:15,363 --> 00:14:17,897
Their next stop is gonna be David.
I'm on it.

323
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:20,667
So, David, what secret
is she getting from you?

324
00:14:20,668 --> 00:14:21,935
What did she want from you?

325
00:14:21,936 --> 00:14:24,570
What do you think she wanted from me?

326
00:14:24,571 --> 00:14:26,439
That we faked the moon landing?

327
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,741
That a Starbucks tall is really a small?

328
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,643
She wanted defiance, liv.

329
00:14:30,644 --> 00:14:34,747
She wanted to know why
a grand jury had been convened.

330
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,049
What did you tell her?

331
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,617
Nothing.
I didn't get the chance.

332
00:14:37,618 --> 00:14:39,584
Next thing I knew, I was
waking up covered in blood,

333
00:14:39,585 --> 00:14:40,752
framed for her murder.

334
00:14:40,753 --> 00:14:42,556
Because apparently I am the single most

335
00:14:42,557 --> 00:14:44,557
unlucky schmuck...

336
00:14:48,028 --> 00:14:50,663
Or because that's the way you wanted it.

337
00:14:50,664 --> 00:14:52,398
What?
You won.

338
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,732
Defiance is dead, and so am I.

339
00:14:53,733 --> 00:14:55,067
So why isn't it enough
to ruin my career?

340
00:14:55,068 --> 00:14:56,601
Why do you have to throw
the rest of my life

341
00:14:56,602 --> 00:14:57,703
on the fire, too?

342
00:14:57,704 --> 00:14:58,906
Are you actually
suggesting--

343
00:14:58,907 --> 00:15:00,606
Unless you haven't won yet.

344
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,474
Or maybe you didn't win until just now.

345
00:15:02,475 --> 00:15:04,611
Or rather until you planted
a dead girl in my bed.

346
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,412
I'm the last loose end, aren't I?

347
00:15:06,413 --> 00:15:09,483
Lock me up, and you have
nothing more to worry about.

348
00:15:17,658 --> 00:15:20,059
I only have a minute.
He's watching me, liv.

349
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,594
He's not watching you.

350
00:15:21,595 --> 00:15:23,362
The president is watching me.

351
00:15:23,363 --> 00:15:24,832
I feel like every time
I leave to see you,

352
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,467
he knows where I'm going and he
adds another mark against me.

353
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,636
Can we not talk about him?

354
00:15:31,605 --> 00:15:33,072
What did you need?

355
00:15:33,073 --> 00:15:34,975
Did you have David Rosen
framed for murder?

356
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:36,676
No offense.
None taken.

357
00:15:36,677 --> 00:15:38,579
Why would I have David Rosen
framed for murder?

358
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,646
To put defiance to bed once and for all.

359
00:15:40,647 --> 00:15:43,649
I can't say it's the worst idea
I've ever heard, but no. No?

360
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,053
No. Defiance is over, Liv.
It died with Verna.

361
00:15:49,623 --> 00:15:52,859
I know things are bad
between you and Fitz, but...

362
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,661
I-I'm sorry about
the christening, by the way.

363
00:15:55,662 --> 00:15:57,831
I'll have you in
and out in an hour or two.

364
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,833
You'll barely have to see him.

365
00:16:01,635 --> 00:16:02,903
What?

366
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:09,475
I think... he knows.

367
00:16:09,476 --> 00:16:11,511
I think he knows what we did.
I'm pretty sure.

368
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,545
Liv, there's no way-- I
haven't slept in ten months.

369
00:16:13,546 --> 00:16:15,949
I have our last conversation
on a loop in my head

370
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,483
all night every night.

371
00:16:17,484 --> 00:16:19,720
I think he knows what we did, Cyrus.

372
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,058
My minute is up.
I have to get back.

373
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:26,692
Are you--
I'm fine.

374
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,631
Cyrus.
What?

375
00:16:31,965 --> 00:16:34,001
Defiance isn't ever going to be over.

376
00:16:44,823 --> 00:16:46,425
Where are we?

377
00:16:50,395 --> 00:16:52,497
We just ran out of time.

378
00:17:05,823 --> 00:17:06,822
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

379
00:17:06,823 --> 00:17:07,989
You kiss?

380
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,726
You give that monkey a kiss?

381
00:17:09,727 --> 00:17:12,061
Give daddy a kiss?

382
00:17:12,062 --> 00:17:14,797
What do you want?

383
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:16,967
- is he in there?
- Shh. It's baby time.

384
00:17:16,968 --> 00:17:19,468
He can play with that baby for hours.

385
00:17:19,469 --> 00:17:21,038
I don't know how he does it.
I don't have the patience.

386
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,905
Me, either.

387
00:17:22,906 --> 00:17:24,541
Mellie.

388
00:17:26,543 --> 00:17:28,544
Something has to be done.

389
00:17:28,545 --> 00:17:30,413
He can't keep this up.

390
00:17:30,414 --> 00:17:31,748
What do you propose we do, Cyrus?

391
00:17:31,749 --> 00:17:33,382
I have tried everything.

392
00:17:33,383 --> 00:17:34,852
Right now I'm just trying
to keep him focused and calm

393
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,619
so that he can run the country.

394
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,989
Sometimes I think that baby is
all that's holding him together.

395
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,425
He knows about defiance.

396
00:17:44,061 --> 00:17:45,728
No.

397
00:17:45,729 --> 00:17:47,563
No. This is about Olivia.

398
00:17:47,564 --> 00:17:49,066
Something happened, and they're done,

399
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:50,633
and he just needs time to adjust.

400
00:17:50,634 --> 00:17:52,335
That's what I thought, too.

401
00:17:52,336 --> 00:17:55,504
But it's been almost a year.
This isn't just about Olivia.

402
00:17:55,505 --> 00:17:57,840
So he's drinking more than usual.

403
00:17:57,841 --> 00:17:59,674
We can handle that.
I am handling that.

404
00:17:59,675 --> 00:18:01,645
He could bathe in scotch for all I care.

405
00:18:01,646 --> 00:18:03,379
That's not the problem.

406
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:07,516
The problem is, he's not
using me like he's supposed to.

407
00:18:07,517 --> 00:18:09,384
I'm the guard dog, I'm the bad cop,

408
00:18:09,385 --> 00:18:10,785
I'm the Dragon that gets released.

409
00:18:10,786 --> 00:18:12,656
I run the meetings and make the calls

410
00:18:12,657 --> 00:18:14,490
and help him come to decisions.

411
00:18:14,491 --> 00:18:15,791
Except I'm not.

412
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:18,861
He's isolating himself.
He's shutting me out.

413
00:18:18,862 --> 00:18:21,530
He's running for the country,
for real, on his own.

414
00:18:21,531 --> 00:18:23,367
He doesn't trust us, Mellie.

415
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:25,434
I've tried talking to him.

416
00:18:25,435 --> 00:18:27,603
Try again.

417
00:18:27,604 --> 00:18:30,439
I will. After I get him through
your daughter's christening.

418
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,408
Whose brilliant Idea was that?

419
00:18:32,409 --> 00:18:34,944
Olivia Pope as godmother?
Mellie...

420
00:18:34,945 --> 00:18:38,481
It's not just my... problem here.

421
00:18:38,482 --> 00:18:41,284
If I'm right, if he knows
about defiance,

422
00:18:41,285 --> 00:18:42,919
it's both of us he doesn't trust.

423
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,588
And if he doesn't trust us
when he gets tired and thirsty

424
00:18:45,589 --> 00:18:47,323
and goes looking for water,

425
00:18:47,324 --> 00:18:49,592
he's going to drink
from someone else's trough.

426
00:18:49,593 --> 00:18:51,360
He needs somewhere to lean,

427
00:18:51,361 --> 00:18:52,996
he's going to lean on someone else.

428
00:18:52,997 --> 00:18:55,364
He's going to start trusting
someone else,

429
00:18:55,365 --> 00:18:58,000
and once that happens,
someone else is going to be

430
00:18:58,001 --> 00:19:00,504
riding our horse across the finish line.

431
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:09,512
Um... boo!

432
00:19:09,513 --> 00:19:11,481
What do you see? Hmm?

433
00:19:11,482 --> 00:19:12,815
Um... boo!

434
00:19:12,816 --> 00:19:14,817
And back to our story that led the hour.

435
00:19:14,818 --> 00:19:16,753
The White House has issued
a statement regarding

436
00:19:16,754 --> 00:19:19,322
the four American Aide workers
who went missing

437
00:19:19,323 --> 00:19:21,490
near Kashfar City yesterday morning.

438
00:19:21,491 --> 00:19:23,526
And while some reports
suggest the Americans

439
00:19:23,527 --> 00:19:26,062
may have been captured by rebel forces,

440
00:19:26,063 --> 00:19:28,664
the White House is denying
those claims, saying--

441
00:19:30,467 --> 00:19:32,936
Any news?
Nothing.

442
00:19:34,338 --> 00:19:36,572
Is David gonna go down for this?

443
00:19:36,573 --> 00:19:39,342
Not if I can help it.

444
00:19:39,343 --> 00:19:40,843
Abby.

445
00:19:40,844 --> 00:19:44,314
Are you--
I'm fine. I'm--I'm fine.

446
00:19:49,386 --> 00:19:50,586
Work helps.

447
00:19:50,587 --> 00:19:52,488
So does exercise--

448
00:19:52,489 --> 00:19:54,524
Stuff that numbs you keeps you
from thinking too much.

449
00:19:54,525 --> 00:19:57,360
Dating also helps, but...

450
00:19:57,361 --> 00:19:59,729
it also helps to remember
that he hates you,

451
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,498
and it helps to try to hate him, too.

452
00:20:01,499 --> 00:20:04,333
And that works for you?

453
00:20:04,334 --> 00:20:06,869
I was talking about you and David.

454
00:20:08,505 --> 00:20:10,406
Someone keeps calling Wendy.

455
00:20:10,407 --> 00:20:12,407
I've been monitoring her
cell phone activity just in case

456
00:20:12,408 --> 00:20:14,743
anything interesting came up,
and today something did--

457
00:20:14,744 --> 00:20:16,544
Four calls, all from the same line.

458
00:20:16,545 --> 00:20:18,346
Can we track the number?
I already did.

459
00:20:18,347 --> 00:20:19,916
They're coming from
the joint chiefs' office.

460
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:21,418
In the Pentagon.

461
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:26,455
It's a fishing expedition.
They got nothing--No case.

462
00:20:26,456 --> 00:20:27,857
They're grasping at air.

463
00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:30,426
So you? You do exactly what was
done to you as a A.U.S.A.

464
00:20:30,427 --> 00:20:31,928
Guy comes in with his lawyer, clams up,

465
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:33,429
flat-out refuses
to play ball.

466
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,464
Probably annoyed you to no end, right?

467
00:20:35,465 --> 00:20:38,567
Now see, that's how we do this.

468
00:20:38,568 --> 00:20:41,037
Say nothing, do nothing,
admit to nothing.

469
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:43,573
Let me do the talking,
and we'll be fine.

470
00:20:44,574 --> 00:20:46,409
Good. Just like that.

471
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,677
You got it.

472
00:20:48,678 --> 00:20:49,880
These past several months
have been very difficult

473
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:51,447
for you, haven't they, David?

474
00:20:51,448 --> 00:20:52,883
You don't have to answer that.
I mean, if I were fired,

475
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:54,617
gosh, I'd be so frustrated.

476
00:20:54,618 --> 00:20:56,619
And not just frustrated, but angry.

477
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,722
The kind of anger that just
sits there and doesn't go away.

478
00:20:59,723 --> 00:21:00,889
Are you angry, David?

479
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,524
You don't have to answer that, either.

480
00:21:02,525 --> 00:21:04,025
In fact, my client doesn't have
to answer any--

481
00:21:04,026 --> 00:21:05,393
Do you remember the case
I was working on

482
00:21:05,394 --> 00:21:06,530
when I got fired, Mike?

483
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,564
We referred to it internally
as defiance.

484
00:21:08,565 --> 00:21:11,301
What are you doing? Defiance is the county
in Ohio that elected our president.

485
00:21:11,302 --> 00:21:13,502
Not by an honest accounting of votes,

486
00:21:13,503 --> 00:21:16,372
the case alleged, but through
an illegal manipulation--

487
00:21:16,373 --> 00:21:17,505
Voting machines.

488
00:21:17,506 --> 00:21:18,973
Okay, I need to, um,
speak with m--

489
00:21:18,974 --> 00:21:20,708
It's a bold claim, and I say "Claim"...

490
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:22,043
because it never
saw the inside of a courtroom.

491
00:21:22,044 --> 00:21:23,513
You wanna know why?
David, please.

492
00:21:23,514 --> 00:21:26,482
Because I was an idiot.
Are you an idiot, too, Mike?

493
00:21:26,483 --> 00:21:29,885
Your theory of the crime
is that I, David Rosen,

494
00:21:29,886 --> 00:21:32,054
the man whose job you're now occupying,

495
00:21:32,055 --> 00:21:33,690
whose chair you're now sitting in,

496
00:21:33,691 --> 00:21:36,492
your longtime colleague
with extensive legal training

497
00:21:36,493 --> 00:21:38,828
and no prior record whatsoever

498
00:21:38,829 --> 00:21:40,396
picked up a woman at a bar

499
00:21:40,397 --> 00:21:41,696
and then brought her to my place,

500
00:21:41,697 --> 00:21:43,333
where I promptly stabbed her to death.

501
00:21:43,334 --> 00:21:45,434
Because that's what I am--
a stabber.

502
00:21:45,435 --> 00:21:47,337
Give me a knife and I'll stab anything.

503
00:21:47,338 --> 00:21:49,004
Oh, how I love to stab.

504
00:21:49,005 --> 00:21:51,007
Which is why, when I finished
stabbing her in my apartment,

505
00:21:51,008 --> 00:21:53,409
I carried the body to her place

506
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,411
and stabbed it some more.

507
00:21:55,412 --> 00:21:57,880
Why settle for a crime of passion

508
00:21:57,881 --> 00:22:00,416
when a burglary gone wrong
is so easy to stage?

509
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:01,916
You were the last person
She was seen with.

510
00:22:01,917 --> 00:22:03,485
By a bartender who's routinely drunk

511
00:22:03,486 --> 00:22:04,821
for the last two-Thirds
of his shift.

512
00:22:04,822 --> 00:22:06,522
Trust me, I'm a regular.

513
00:22:06,523 --> 00:22:10,025
Which in evidentiary terms means
you have absolutely nothing.

514
00:22:10,026 --> 00:22:13,496
So if you want to keep this job,
stay in This nice Office,

515
00:22:13,497 --> 00:22:15,998
look out at that beautiful
view of the mall every day

516
00:22:15,999 --> 00:22:18,634
and put yourself on the fast
track to Attorney General,

517
00:22:18,635 --> 00:22:20,436
don't be an idiot.

518
00:22:20,437 --> 00:22:24,440
Leave me alone
and forget this ever happened.

519
00:22:24,441 --> 00:22:26,374
Because only an idiot pursues cases

520
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:27,744
he stands no chance of winning.

521
00:22:27,745 --> 00:22:30,312
I learned that the hard way.
If I were you,

522
00:22:30,313 --> 00:22:31,947
I'd spare myself that shame.

523
00:22:31,948 --> 00:22:33,717
And since I'm under no legal obligation

524
00:22:33,718 --> 00:22:35,985
to continue this
bizarre and humiliating visit

525
00:22:35,986 --> 00:22:37,454
to my old office...

526
00:22:38,922 --> 00:22:40,356
I'll leave you to it.

527
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:43,859
Well...

528
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,761
That was fun.

529
00:22:45,762 --> 00:22:48,597
We should, uh, do it again soon.

530
00:22:48,598 --> 00:22:50,700
I expect we will.

531
00:22:57,307 --> 00:22:59,775
I'm looking for a captain Jacob Ballard.

532
00:22:59,776 --> 00:23:01,443
You found him.

533
00:23:01,444 --> 00:23:03,979
You could have just called me...

534
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,513
or run into me accidentally
at the coffee place.

535
00:23:05,514 --> 00:23:07,282
You didn't have to come
all the way down to the Pentagon

536
00:23:07,283 --> 00:23:08,552
just to ask me out.

537
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,287
That's a hike.

538
00:23:18,705 --> 00:23:20,906
She was stabbed to death?
Oh, my God.

539
00:23:20,907 --> 00:23:23,909
Do they know--
Who did it? No.

540
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:27,662
No idea.
Was she working on a story?

541
00:23:27,663 --> 00:23:29,365
Maybe trying to get
some information from you?

542
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,966
Are you a detective?
No.

543
00:23:31,967 --> 00:23:33,502
'cause you sound like a detective.

544
00:23:33,503 --> 00:23:35,503
I'm not a detective.

545
00:23:35,504 --> 00:23:37,806
Well, then why are you asking me
detective-like questions?

546
00:23:37,807 --> 00:23:39,507
I can't tell you that.
Ahh.

547
00:23:39,508 --> 00:23:41,543
I know Wendy traded in secrets.

548
00:23:41,544 --> 00:23:42,912
Was there anything she had on you,

549
00:23:42,913 --> 00:23:45,280
anything you might have leaked to her?

550
00:23:45,281 --> 00:23:47,549
So even though you're not a detective,

551
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,584
I'm some kind of suspect here?

552
00:23:49,585 --> 00:23:50,818
At this point,

553
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:52,988
I think everyone
in her phone log is a suspect.

554
00:23:55,357 --> 00:23:56,657
She came to me a month ago

555
00:23:56,658 --> 00:23:58,358
with some information
she wanted to sell.

556
00:23:58,359 --> 00:24:00,627
I didn't take it very seriously
until a couple of days ago

557
00:24:00,628 --> 00:24:01,862
when something I was working on

558
00:24:01,863 --> 00:24:03,463
Suddenly made
that information pertinent.

559
00:24:03,464 --> 00:24:04,533
What were you working on?

560
00:24:04,534 --> 00:24:06,334
My turn.

561
00:24:06,335 --> 00:24:07,468
Classified.

562
00:24:07,469 --> 00:24:09,571
Unlike you, I don't have the choice

563
00:24:09,572 --> 00:24:11,472
about what I can and cannot say.

564
00:24:11,473 --> 00:24:13,842
Were you going to buy
the information she was selling?

565
00:24:15,945 --> 00:24:18,546
I work at intel
for the joint chiefs of staff.

566
00:24:18,547 --> 00:24:21,583
We are not in the business
of paying for information.

567
00:24:21,584 --> 00:24:23,452
Even though she knew
something you didn't?

568
00:24:23,453 --> 00:24:26,788
An assumption I can neither
confirm nor deny.

569
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:28,891
By the way, shouldn't
the police have her phone log?

570
00:24:28,892 --> 00:24:30,326
How do you have it, too?

571
00:24:31,393 --> 00:24:33,027
I can't tell.
Can't tell me.

572
00:24:34,463 --> 00:24:36,598
Well, since you're not
able to tell me anything,

573
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:38,766
and I'm not able to tell you anything,

574
00:24:38,767 --> 00:24:40,401
I guess we're done here.

575
00:24:40,402 --> 00:24:41,836
I guess we are.

576
00:24:41,837 --> 00:24:43,604
Unless you'd like
to go out to dinner with me.

577
00:24:43,605 --> 00:24:45,574
Then we can not talk
about all sorts of things.

578
00:24:45,575 --> 00:24:48,676
Sorry.
I don't think so.

579
00:24:48,677 --> 00:24:51,546
You sure?
I can be very unhelpful.

580
00:24:51,547 --> 00:24:54,250
Oh, I'm sure you can.

581
00:25:00,555 --> 00:25:01,888
We can't get human intelligence

582
00:25:01,889 --> 00:25:03,690
on where the hostages are being held.

583
00:25:03,691 --> 00:25:05,459
The guys they grabbed
were our eyes and ears

584
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,828
on the ground there.
But the N.S.A. picked up chatter

585
00:25:07,829 --> 00:25:09,529
from a small city in the northeast

586
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:10,964
after a recon overflight, we pinpointed

587
00:25:10,965 --> 00:25:12,635
the building where the hostages
are being held.

588
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,271
Degree of confidence? High. These K.L.F.
Guys like to talk.

589
00:25:18,374 --> 00:25:19,674
Send in a S.E.A.L. team.

590
00:25:19,675 --> 00:25:22,010
Mr. President,
can we just take a breath

591
00:25:22,011 --> 00:25:23,544
to consider other options?

592
00:25:23,545 --> 00:25:25,414
It'd be faster to let
the Kashfari military handle it.

593
00:25:25,415 --> 00:25:27,582
I wouldn't trust them to watch my dog.

594
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:29,752
And no one in Their government
can even know about this.

595
00:25:29,753 --> 00:25:31,786
If I may, s--
Enough.

596
00:25:31,787 --> 00:25:33,554
How soon can we dispatch a team?

597
00:25:33,555 --> 00:25:35,424
They're locked and loaded,
sir, just awaiting your go.

598
00:25:35,425 --> 00:25:38,294
Mr. President, please, a word?

599
00:25:41,363 --> 00:25:42,696
There's a way that this works.

600
00:25:42,697 --> 00:25:44,364
If you pulled me out of the sit room

601
00:25:44,365 --> 00:25:46,233
to give me a civics lesson,
or to tell me I'm ticking--

602
00:25:46,234 --> 00:25:47,534
Your job is to process
all of the various opinions--

603
00:25:47,535 --> 00:25:49,236
Here we go. Should I
get a notebook and pencil?

604
00:25:49,237 --> 00:25:50,873
No, sir. I simply--
Then make your point.

605
00:25:50,874 --> 00:25:53,374
You've been isolating me,
shutting me out.

606
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:56,744
I've been waiting to address it with
you until-- Make your point, Cyrus.

607
00:25:56,745 --> 00:25:59,480
You can't do this alone.
No one can.

608
00:25:59,481 --> 00:26:02,517
You're my bulldog, my Dragon.

609
00:26:02,518 --> 00:26:04,552
Is that today's rehashed speech?

610
00:26:04,553 --> 00:26:06,420
You're isolating me,
and it's bad business.

611
00:26:06,421 --> 00:26:08,390
It's bad for the country.
It's bad...

612
00:26:08,391 --> 00:26:10,725
for me, Mr. President.

613
00:26:10,726 --> 00:26:12,927
It makes it very hard for me
to do my job.

614
00:26:12,928 --> 00:26:15,530
And my job is simply
to make yours easier,

615
00:26:15,531 --> 00:26:18,433
So, please, will you let-- Are we
done discussing your hurt feelings?

616
00:26:18,434 --> 00:26:20,336
Because I would like to get back
to saving American lives.

617
00:26:20,337 --> 00:26:21,836
Can we do that?
Will you let us?

618
00:26:21,837 --> 00:26:23,404
Yes, Mr. President.
Excellent.

619
00:26:23,405 --> 00:26:25,840
Now, what's your take?

620
00:26:25,841 --> 00:26:27,508
It's my opinion

621
00:26:27,509 --> 00:26:29,345
that it's too early
to send in a s.E.A.L. Team.

622
00:26:29,346 --> 00:26:30,745
We need to be careful.

623
00:26:30,746 --> 00:26:33,848
We need to contain this situation.

624
00:26:33,849 --> 00:26:38,453
Allow the Kashfaris some time
to gather intel on the ground,

625
00:26:38,454 --> 00:26:41,456
so we can be better prepared
when and if the time comes

626
00:26:41,457 --> 00:26:43,524
to pull the trigger on an extraction.

627
00:26:43,525 --> 00:26:45,993
Fine. We'll hold off.

628
00:26:45,994 --> 00:26:47,628
For now.

629
00:26:47,629 --> 00:26:50,398
All right.

630
00:26:50,399 --> 00:26:52,967
Great.

631
00:26:52,968 --> 00:26:54,669
We're done.

632
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:57,373
Very good, Mr. President.

633
00:27:04,246 --> 00:27:06,447
She was on to
something big--Wendy.

634
00:27:06,448 --> 00:27:08,282
Ahh.

635
00:27:08,283 --> 00:27:09,883
A high-level military
intelligence officer

636
00:27:09,884 --> 00:27:11,487
was desperate to talk to her
the day she died.

637
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,820
He wouldn't tell me why,

638
00:27:12,821 --> 00:27:14,488
which means she was on to something big.

639
00:27:14,489 --> 00:27:16,258
And I'm willing to bet
whatever she was on to

640
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,393
is why she's dead now.
It's why you were framed.

641
00:27:18,394 --> 00:27:19,994
How much do I owe you?
What?

642
00:27:19,995 --> 00:27:21,964
For your services.
Or did you take a commission

643
00:27:21,965 --> 00:27:23,798
when I sold my soul to the devil?

644
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:26,801
Your troubles aren't over.
Not by a long shot.

645
00:27:26,802 --> 00:27:28,436
But you and I are.

646
00:27:28,437 --> 00:27:30,839
Everything you've ever done
for as long as I've known you

647
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,875
has been tailor-made
to hurt me, so I'm done.

648
00:27:33,876 --> 00:27:36,444
I'm done with you,
I'm done with your people.

649
00:27:36,445 --> 00:27:38,246
So how much, Olivia?
David--

650
00:27:38,247 --> 00:27:39,948
How much?!

651
00:27:43,452 --> 00:27:45,454
You can't afford me.

652
00:28:40,069 --> 00:28:41,869
Mint?

653
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,203
What?

654
00:28:43,204 --> 00:28:45,372
Mint.
You smell like alcohol.

655
00:28:45,373 --> 00:28:47,742
You're Ella's godfather.
We're going to her christening.

656
00:28:47,743 --> 00:28:49,911
You can't smell like alcohol.

657
00:28:54,382 --> 00:28:56,083
You know, don't you?

658
00:28:56,084 --> 00:28:58,320
About defiance.

659
00:28:59,854 --> 00:29:02,990
You feel betrayed, and I am sorry.

660
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,225
It was--There was a decision
made in a moment--

661
00:29:05,226 --> 00:29:06,760
I don't want to discuss it.

662
00:29:06,761 --> 00:29:08,996
You deserve to be president, Fitz.

663
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,864
No, I don't.

664
00:29:10,865 --> 00:29:12,866
But that doesn't matter,
because here I am.

665
00:29:12,867 --> 00:29:14,801
Fitz, if you had been a part of
that conversation-- But I wasn't.

666
00:29:14,802 --> 00:29:16,738
No one asked me, and I said
I don't want to discuss it.

667
00:29:16,739 --> 00:29:18,340
No, you just want to drink.

668
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:23,844
You're shutting Cyrus out.

669
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,813
He's not stupid.

670
00:29:25,814 --> 00:29:27,814
He knows he's on the outside.
He's your chief of staff.

671
00:29:27,815 --> 00:29:29,117
If you're gonna try to tell me
how to run the country

672
00:29:29,118 --> 00:29:30,718
that you helped steal
for me--

673
00:29:30,719 --> 00:29:32,853
I was going to say you're right.

674
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,855
You're right to shut Cyrus out.

675
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:37,158
You are right.

676
00:29:41,329 --> 00:29:43,732
It was Cyrus.

677
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,169
Cyrus... pushed
and he plotted and he planned

678
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:53,774
and he dug his heels in, and he made us.

679
00:29:53,775 --> 00:29:56,110
I wanted you to be president.
I did.

680
00:29:56,111 --> 00:30:01,448
I am unashamed of how much
I wanted the White House for us.

681
00:30:01,449 --> 00:30:03,884
And I can be an animal if I need to be.

682
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,053
I'm proud to rip the flesh off anyone

683
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,422
who comes between me and...

684
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:15,330
Cyrus... stole the election.

685
00:30:17,365 --> 00:30:21,835
He decided, and he got Liv on board

686
00:30:21,836 --> 00:30:24,805
and Verna and... me.

687
00:30:24,806 --> 00:30:26,774
He got me.

688
00:30:26,775 --> 00:30:30,010
It was Cyrus.

689
00:30:30,011 --> 00:30:32,479
I'm not trying to excuse what I did.

690
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,815
I'm not trying to say
I didn't have a part.

691
00:30:34,816 --> 00:30:36,884
I'm just saying you're right.

692
00:30:36,885 --> 00:30:38,786
To shut him out.

693
00:30:38,787 --> 00:30:42,956
To not trust him.

694
00:30:42,957 --> 00:30:45,326
I think you're right.

695
00:30:47,228 --> 00:30:49,164
Because...

696
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,967
It was Cyrus.

697
00:30:58,973 --> 00:31:00,974
You have me.

698
00:31:00,975 --> 00:31:03,244
You can trust me.

699
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:17,357
I'm thinking of sending
an extraction team into Kashfar.

700
00:31:17,358 --> 00:31:19,761
I need those guys to come back alive.

701
00:31:22,163 --> 00:31:24,933
I think you should trust your instincts.

702
00:31:27,902 --> 00:31:30,704
I need to know
I'm making the right call.

703
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:34,775
You are the president.
Any call you make is right.

704
00:31:34,776 --> 00:31:36,410
And if it doesn't work out,

705
00:31:36,411 --> 00:31:38,412
we'll figure out what the next step is.

706
00:31:38,413 --> 00:31:40,782
We can do this.

707
00:31:54,863 --> 00:31:56,865
It's gonna be all right.

708
00:32:13,381 --> 00:32:15,883
Hi, Darling.

709
00:32:15,884 --> 00:32:18,785
Don't worry. The ceremony
will be short and sweet.

710
00:32:18,786 --> 00:32:21,388
They abbreviate for the godless.
Call the secretary.

711
00:32:21,389 --> 00:32:23,824
Tell him to send in
the S.E.A.L. team.

712
00:32:23,825 --> 00:32:25,093
Do it before the ceremony.

713
00:32:25,094 --> 00:32:27,794
I thought we agreed
to take a breath on this.

714
00:32:27,795 --> 00:32:29,162
Take as many breaths as you like,

715
00:32:29,163 --> 00:32:30,865
then recount them in your memoirs.

716
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:33,101
Call in that S.E.A.L. team.
Now.

717
00:32:39,841 --> 00:32:42,743
Hey, James. How are ya?

718
00:32:50,852 --> 00:32:53,119
How fortunate is baby Ella?

719
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,720
To have such fine examples of leadership

720
00:32:54,721 --> 00:32:56,357
and commitment to our lord and savior.

721
00:32:56,358 --> 00:33:00,694
Ella Margaret Novak Beene...

722
00:33:00,695 --> 00:33:03,897
I baptize you
in the name of the father...

♪ I love you ♪

728
00:33:13,107 --> 00:33:14,274
amen.

729
00:33:14,275 --> 00:33:16,810
Amen.

730
00:33:16,811 --> 00:33:18,046
Ella won't remember today.

731
00:33:18,047 --> 00:33:20,147
She won't remember
all of you cooing over her.

732
00:33:20,148 --> 00:33:22,450
She won't remember the president
of the United States

733
00:33:22,451 --> 00:33:24,084
holding her.

734
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,485
I hope to God she won't remember
the temper tantrum I threw

735
00:33:26,486 --> 00:33:28,022
when I found out the Japanese peonies

736
00:33:28,023 --> 00:33:30,123
would not arrive in time
for the ceremony.

737
00:33:30,124 --> 00:33:32,693
It is, however, etched
deeply into my memories.

738
00:33:34,796 --> 00:33:37,898
She won't remember, but I hope
all of you will remind her.

739
00:33:37,899 --> 00:33:39,801
Not about the absence of the peonies,

740
00:33:39,802 --> 00:33:43,804
but about how she was
surrounded by love.

741
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:48,475
To Ella. To family.

742
00:33:48,476 --> 00:33:50,277
Thank you.

We both did.

777
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,751
It won't happen again.

778
00:35:53,388 --> 00:35:56,024
I was talking about defiance.

779
00:36:00,728 --> 00:36:04,131
That wasn't a mistake.

780
00:36:04,132 --> 00:36:05,400
That was betrayal.

781
00:36:07,635 --> 00:36:08,969
We are done

782
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:11,070
I may not be able to control
my erections around you,

783
00:36:11,071 --> 00:36:12,607
but that does not mean I want you.

784
00:36:12,608 --> 00:36:15,576
We... are done.

785
00:36:17,812 --> 00:36:21,449
Sir, it's a go. Right now.

786
00:36:30,391 --> 00:36:32,425
First floor secure.
Advancing towards target.

787
00:36:32,426 --> 00:36:34,060
Based on heat-sensored
satellite imagery,

788
00:36:34,061 --> 00:36:35,928
we're expecting anywhere
from five to eight

789
00:36:35,929 --> 00:36:37,532
enemy combatants guarding the hostages

790
00:36:37,533 --> 00:36:40,100
in the northwest corner
of the second floor.

791
00:36:40,101 --> 00:36:41,803
Centcom, we've reached the target.

792
00:36:41,804 --> 00:36:44,137
Alpha, you're a go.

793
00:36:44,138 --> 00:36:47,541
Fire in the hole!

794
00:36:47,542 --> 00:36:48,643
This is it.

795
00:36:52,847 --> 00:36:54,749
Whiskey tango foxtrot!
It's empty!

796
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,116
No hostages.

797
00:36:56,117 --> 00:36:57,483
What the hell?
All clear.

798
00:36:57,484 --> 00:36:58,751
Alpha Bravo ten, awaiting orders.

799
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,019
Tell them to abort.
Centcom, do you copy?

800
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,122
Charlie Mike?
This could be a trap.

801
00:37:01,123 --> 00:37:02,989
Get them out of there now!

802
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:04,491
Centcom, abort.
Do you copy?

803
00:37:04,492 --> 00:37:06,393
Copy. Relaying order now.

804
00:37:06,394 --> 00:37:08,895
"E" and "E"! Echo Echo, go, go, go!
Move, move!

805
00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:10,630
Stay on your six.

806
00:37:10,631 --> 00:37:11,730
Alpha Bravo, go two.

807
00:37:12,734 --> 00:37:14,434
What the hell just happened?

808
00:37:14,435 --> 00:37:16,838
How did we send a s.E.A.L. Team
to the wrong address?

809
00:37:16,839 --> 00:37:18,371
We didn't.
How did this happen?

810
00:37:18,372 --> 00:37:21,408
Permission to clear
the room, Mr. President?

811
00:37:21,409 --> 00:37:22,677
Go ahead.

812
00:37:32,854 --> 00:37:35,922
Sir... we have a mole.

813
00:37:35,923 --> 00:37:37,891
Damn it.

814
00:37:37,892 --> 00:37:39,024
I'll get the director
of national intelligence

815
00:37:39,025 --> 00:37:40,126
over here right now.

816
00:37:40,127 --> 00:37:41,762
We'll start an internal investigation.

817
00:37:41,763 --> 00:37:43,096
Hold off.
What?

818
00:37:43,097 --> 00:37:44,764
Hold off.
But, sir--

819
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:46,134
Are you having trouble hearing lately?

820
00:37:46,135 --> 00:37:48,935
When I say "Stand down,"
I mean stand down.

821
00:37:48,936 --> 00:37:50,437
We've got a mole.

822
00:37:50,438 --> 00:37:52,106
I need to think about how to proceed.

823
00:37:52,107 --> 00:37:53,773
Sir--

824
00:37:53,774 --> 00:37:55,543
I need to figure out who I can trust.

825
00:38:03,384 --> 00:38:04,885
Since when do you knock?

826
00:38:04,886 --> 00:38:06,887
I'm sorry.

827
00:38:06,888 --> 00:38:08,522
Really? For which part?

828
00:38:08,523 --> 00:38:10,424
All of it.

829
00:38:11,726 --> 00:38:13,827
Don't be. I'm fine.

830
00:38:13,828 --> 00:38:15,829
David-- I'm fine. Never been better.

831
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:17,062
Found my calling--

832
00:38:17,063 --> 00:38:18,799
Molding the young minds of America.

833
00:38:20,968 --> 00:38:22,937
Good night, Abby.

834
00:38:44,892 --> 00:38:46,126
What is that?

835
00:38:46,127 --> 00:38:47,727
Wendy's flash drive.

836
00:38:47,728 --> 00:38:49,030
She had just started downloading

837
00:38:49,031 --> 00:38:51,064
my defiance files when she died.

838
00:38:51,065 --> 00:38:53,067
Whoever killed her probably
didn't even know it was there.

839
00:38:53,068 --> 00:38:54,802
Take a look.

840
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:58,739
Click on the one titled
"Albatross."

841
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:03,944
There's over 350 pages
of high-Level,

842
00:39:03,945 --> 00:39:07,013
classified military intelligence
on there.

843
00:39:07,014 --> 00:39:09,816
Nuclear missile locations.
Black sites.

844
00:39:09,817 --> 00:39:13,486
The coordinates for
the president's wartime bunkers.

845
00:39:13,487 --> 00:39:15,522
There's six of them in the country,

846
00:39:15,523 --> 00:39:17,024
just in case they ever
ask it on "Jeopardy!"

847
00:39:17,025 --> 00:39:19,025
This is a major security breach.

848
00:39:19,026 --> 00:39:21,861
No civilian should have
their hands on this stuff.

849
00:39:21,862 --> 00:39:24,698
I think this is your something big.

850
00:39:24,699 --> 00:39:26,800
I would love to forget
about this whole thing.

851
00:39:26,801 --> 00:39:28,703
I would love to forget I ever met Wendy.

852
00:39:28,704 --> 00:39:31,137
I'd love to forget I ever met you.

853
00:39:31,138 --> 00:39:33,840
But now... I need you,

854
00:39:33,841 --> 00:39:36,876
because I'd be really
terrible at prison.

855
00:39:36,877 --> 00:39:39,045
That's if I'm lucky enough
to live that long.

856
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:41,014
You're not just here for you.

857
00:39:41,015 --> 00:39:43,149
I know you, David.
This is about justice.

858
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,986
This is about dusting off the white hat

859
00:39:44,987 --> 00:39:48,422
and putting it back where it belongs.

860
00:40:10,978 --> 00:40:13,013
Baby's asleep.

861
00:40:13,014 --> 00:40:15,949
Thought we could pick up
where we left off yesterday.

862
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,017
No.

863
00:40:17,018 --> 00:40:17,952
Fitz--
No.

864
00:40:17,953 --> 00:40:19,953
No. No.
Come on. It'll be fun.

865
00:40:19,954 --> 00:40:22,889
No. No. Mellie, damn it, I said no!

866
00:40:24,859 --> 00:40:27,460
I'm sorry.

867
00:40:27,461 --> 00:40:28,962
I'm sorry.

868
00:40:28,963 --> 00:40:31,699
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

869
00:40:33,968 --> 00:40:35,970
I'm sorry.

870
00:41:28,422 --> 00:41:30,890
Hello?
It's Olivia Pope.

871
00:41:30,891 --> 00:41:32,093
Ah, I thought you might call.

872
00:41:32,094 --> 00:41:33,827
Oh, yeah? Why is that?

873
00:41:33,828 --> 00:41:35,594
Because that's what beautiful women do

874
00:41:35,595 --> 00:41:36,929
when I invite them
to have dinner with me.

875
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:38,899
You're assuming I called to accept.

876
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,934
I'm a high-ranking
intelligence officer.

877
00:41:40,935 --> 00:41:42,669
They train me to read people.

878
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,939
Where should we go?
Got any ideas?

879
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,506
There's a quiet little

880
00:41:46,507 --> 00:41:49,809
French place on Connecticut
everyone's raving about.

881
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:51,045
Quiet's not really my thing.

882
00:41:51,046 --> 00:41:53,880
No? I had four brothers and two sisters.

883
00:41:53,881 --> 00:41:57,450
Quiet, uh...
quiet freaks me out.

884
00:41:57,451 --> 00:41:59,919
So what is your thing?

885
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,855
Honestly?

886
00:42:01,856 --> 00:42:03,957
People watching.

887
00:42:03,958 --> 00:42:06,793
It's got its own category on Zagat.

888
00:42:06,794 --> 00:42:08,395
So does late-night dancing,

889
00:42:08,396 --> 00:42:10,697
but I'm guessing
that's not in the cards.

890
00:42:10,698 --> 00:42:12,465
Depends how much wine I drink.

891
00:42:12,466 --> 00:42:13,833
Really?

892
00:42:13,834 --> 00:42:16,036
Well, then maybe we should
go to that French place.

893
00:42:16,037 --> 00:42:19,507
How does, uh... how's 8:00
on Friday sound?

894
00:42:21,675 --> 00:42:23,576
8:00 on Friday
sounds perfect.

895
00:42:23,577 --> 00:42:25,912
Good.

896
00:42:25,913 --> 00:42:27,815
Well, I will see you then, Olivia Pope.

897
00:42:27,816 --> 00:42:30,384
See you then, Captain Ballard.

897
00:42:31,305 --> 00:42:37,397
