When the Taliban was in power,

00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,359
they enforced their version of sharia.

625
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,776
One of their edicts was a rule that

626

all men must shave
the hair of their pubis.

627

a dowel,

629

along the front of a man's trousers.

If a man's pubic hair was long enough
to curl around the dowel,

they would beat him.

do I look like a man to walk the streets

No. Whatever you wear in Kabul is fine.

- Yes.

Hey. General, do you have a minute?

- Not now, Baker.
- It's just...

812
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,954
The Taliban haven't been
destroying the well here.

813
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,640
The women of the village
are destroying it.

Or so they tell me.

815
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,915
We dug that well several times
for the women

816
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,672
so they don't have to walk to the river.

817
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,518
But they want to walk to the river.

818
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,160
It's their only chance to be social

820
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,313
I think that they have a bunch
of old Soviet landmines,

821
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,551

and throw rocks at it.

Kim, did you ever feel like
you're manning that tollgate

823
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,953
and the engineer's yelling,
"I got pig iron, I got pig iron"?

824
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,633
No. I don't know what that means.
But it's very folksy.

825
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,915
Also, the women, obviously,
they don't want the men

826
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,558
to know about this, so they are hoping

827
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:34,234
that you would just refuse
to repair the well this time.

828
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,320
Well, they're in luck.

That's just wrong,

I'm just saying,

1498
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:05,595
as journalists, we have
an obligation to this story.

1499
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:09,229
And Afghanistan should be
on our air more, period.

1500
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:10,992
With the resources we have over there,

1501
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,548
Afghanistan should
definitely be on our air more.

1502
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:17,758
But the problem is,
as much as everyone loves the troops,

1503
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:21,270
they don't actually want to watch
them on the news anymore.

So I can't give Afghanistan more air.

I went to the gift shop at Taliban.
