00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,500
You will get nothing from me, young man.

3
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,250
I worked too hard in this
life to let someone...

4
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,500
Do you wanna end up dead?

5
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,500
No, no, please, don't hurt me.

6
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,250
Are you fucking kidding me?

7
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,000
No!

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,750
Not on my watch, motherfucker.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,750
Do you wanna die right now?

10
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:44,500
I'll die here!

11
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,250
No, please, God!

12
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,000
Shut up!

13
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,750
I'm not gonna give you anything!

14
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,500
On your ass I'll pull the trigger

15
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,000
if you don't shut your mouth!

16
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,250
You're hurting me, you're hurting me!

17
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,500
Did I hurt you?

18
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,000
Do you like to hurt an old man, do you?

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,250
Now give me your fucking wallet.

20
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,750
No, please don't hit!

21
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,250
No!
No, somebody help me!

22
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,250
Help!

23
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,250
Help me!

24
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,000
Shut up your fucking mouth!

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,500
Help me!

26
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,500
God, where is everybody?

27
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,000
Is there nobody in this fucking world,

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,500
who can help me, for God's sake?

29
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,000
Elders like you always bring money.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Where is your fucking wallet?

31
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,750
Now give me your fucking wallet!

32
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,000
Where is your fucking wallet?

33
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,500
Right now, where is it?

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,500
Fuck you!

35
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,250
I'll fuck you if you don't
give me your wallet.

36
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,000
Oh..I know your face!

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,250
May I please speak with Laird?

38
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,500
No?
Okay.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,500
No, just tell him Wade called, thank you.

40
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,750
Help please!
Somebody must be hearing me!

41
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,500
Give me your wallet!

42
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,500
Can you hear me?

43
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,500
Help!

44
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,000
Shut up!

45
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,750
Help!

46
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,750
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

47
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,000
Wow, nice suit!

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,500
Zip it, Stan Lee!

49
00:02:09,424 --> 00:02:13,324
♪ I can see a new horizon ♪
♪ underneath the blazin' sky ♪

50
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:18,048
♪ I'll be where the eagle's flying ♪
♪ higher and higher ♪

51
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,750
Oh, Jesus!

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,750
Oh, that's not good.

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
No, no, no.

54
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,500
Oh, you're not gonna walk that one off.

55
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,750
Oh, that's so gross.

56
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,250
I'm so sorry.

57
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,750
I... I spent way too long in
the phone booth.

58
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,500
If I'm being honest with myself,
I should have just called 911.

59
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,500
Well,

60
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,500
none of that matters now.

61
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,000
I think we're both,

62
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,250
missing the real point here.

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,700
What the fuck is a phone booth
doing on a street corner?

64
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,500
Didn't those disappear in '98?

65
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,500
Suppose I could have just used my cell.

66
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,550
What do you think...Oh!

67
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,250
A Cherry Garcia ice cream?

68
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,750
You gonna eat this?

69
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,250
Don't answer now.

70
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,500
Just rest.

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,250
Actually I made a call.

72
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,500
The stupid costumer.

73
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,750
His name is Laird.
He usually helps me put the suit on.

74
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,250
I don't know how the
other guys do it so quickly.

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,750
You probably wouldn't
be dead if it was Logan.

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What's he gotta change into?

77
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,500
Guy wears a fucking tank
top and a pair of jeans.

78
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,000
Yeah.

79
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,250
Want to get my tank top on?

80
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,500
Bit of perspiration, Have a nice, little...

81
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,500
crime-fighting spree, yeah.

82
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,250
Happy Hug-A-Koala Day...
