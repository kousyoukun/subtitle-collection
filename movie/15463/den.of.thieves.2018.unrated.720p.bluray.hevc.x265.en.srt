1
00:02:07,602 --> 00:02:09,668
No, no, no, bro! We're not here for you!
Don't even think about it!

2
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,405
Don't you move,
motherfucker!

3
00:02:11,407 --> 00:02:13,777
Hands away from the weapon, bro!
Fucking relax!

4
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:18,245
3170. We're being held up.

5
00:02:18,247 --> 00:02:21,281
Armor piercing rounds
are chambered in this firearm!

6
00:02:21,283 --> 00:02:24,251
Please don't be the asshole
who forces me to use them.

7
00:02:24,253 --> 00:02:26,387
Take your foot off the gas,

8
00:02:26,389 --> 00:02:29,621
press the unlock button,
and step out of the vehicle,

9
00:02:29,623 --> 00:02:31,590
or we will forcibly
remove you!

10
00:02:31,592 --> 00:02:34,897
Fucking do it! Now!

11
00:02:35,464 --> 00:02:37,266
Your choice! Go!

12
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,952
What the fuck!

13
00:02:57,954 --> 00:02:59,986
He fucking went for his gun.

14
00:02:59,988 --> 00:03:02,158
He spilled his fucking coffee.

15
00:03:10,664 --> 00:03:11,966
Shit.

16
00:03:11,968 --> 00:03:12,969
Gardena, 30 seconds out.

17
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:15,068
Copy.

18
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,638
Thirty out. Hustle!

19
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,744
- Pop it.
- Ready.

20
00:03:33,355 --> 00:03:34,454
Man on!

21
00:03:39,194 --> 00:03:40,660
Out of fucking time.

22
00:03:40,662 --> 00:03:42,329
Prepare to engage.

23
00:03:42,331 --> 00:03:43,864
Contact right!

24
00:03:43,866 --> 00:03:46,432
Range 100. Suppressive fire.

25
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,114
Contact left!

26
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:04,687
Dispatch, 10-97.
LAPD is on scene.

27
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:19,502
We are under heavy fire!

28
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:42,658
Fuck!

29
00:04:49,765 --> 00:04:50,933
Motherfucker!

30
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:01,777
Whoa, whoa.
I got you. I got you.

31
00:05:18,794 --> 00:05:20,964
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

32
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,615
What the fuck was that?

33
00:05:43,617 --> 00:05:45,085
Did you see him go
for his gun?

34
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:48,291
I don't know.
I just saw Bosco lit him up.

35
00:05:54,796 --> 00:05:57,063
Take the second left
into the tunnel.

36
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,969
Hug the airport.
Take the tunnel.

37
00:06:18,154 --> 00:06:19,651
Go right on Doty.

38
00:06:19,653 --> 00:06:20,856
Right on Doty.

39
00:07:29,058 --> 00:07:30,991
Make sure you take care
of those weapons.

40
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:33,063
I don't want any
accidental discharges.

41
00:07:34,596 --> 00:07:36,830
- What are you looking at him for?
- Ray.

42
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,097
I'm not talking to him.
I'm talking to you.

43
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:39,402
What the fuck was that?

44
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:49,275
What else
did you fuck up, huh?

45
00:07:51,212 --> 00:07:53,116
You sure you were clean
all the way home?

46
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,118
Catch any tails?

47
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,260
Where did Marcus
take those rounds?

48
00:08:07,429 --> 00:08:09,597
Femoral artery. He's done.

49
00:08:13,234 --> 00:08:15,436
Well, we knew the risks.

50
00:08:15,438 --> 00:08:17,440
Shit popped off.
We handled it. That's it.

51
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:25,782
Hey, B.

52
00:08:26,948 --> 00:08:28,948
Get back over there.

53
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,084
See who responded.
It was probably LASD.

54
00:08:31,086 --> 00:08:33,618
They'll supersede Gardena,

55
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,126
but if it's Major Crimes,
we've got a problem.

56
00:08:43,466 --> 00:08:45,731
All clear? No GPS?

57
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,803
It's one of the old models, man.
We good.

58
00:08:49,972 --> 00:08:51,639
We've got to
get this patched up.

59
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:53,476
We need this clean.

60
00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:01,418
You good?

61
00:09:04,153 --> 00:09:05,822
We're cop killers now.

62
00:09:31,678 --> 00:09:33,282
Well, that looks
like it hurt.

63
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:35,951
No?

64
00:09:37,684 --> 00:09:39,518
Good morning,
fellow officers.

65
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,854
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

66
00:09:40,856 --> 00:09:41,955
Yeah?

67
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:43,891
I take it he's a bad guy.

68
00:09:43,893 --> 00:09:45,690
You mean the guy
with the black body armor,

69
00:09:45,692 --> 00:09:47,693
shotgun, and gas mask?

70
00:09:47,695 --> 00:09:50,297
That's very funny.
We know who he is yet?

71
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:51,300
Rough night?

72
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,966
Yes. Next subject?

73
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,801
You're not looking
so hot there, bubba.

74
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,738
I think he
looks amazing.

75
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,173
You better start downing the POM juice,
big man. We've got a piss test Friday.

76
00:10:01,175 --> 00:10:03,042
Thursday.

77
00:10:03,044 --> 00:10:05,244
What, like you Mormons have been
drinking wheatgrass all fucking month?

78
00:10:05,246 --> 00:10:06,713
Please.

79
00:10:06,715 --> 00:10:08,382
You got another one of those?
I'm fucking starving.

80
00:10:08,384 --> 00:10:09,917
Yeah, there's a
couple that don't have blood.

81
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,652
I think it's one of the
pinkies with the sprinkles.

82
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,821
- That's some real donut.
- Okay, what's the tally?

83
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,356
Those are horrendous, dude.

84
00:10:17,358 --> 00:10:19,759
We've got four dead, six on
the way to the hospital.

85
00:10:19,761 --> 00:10:21,762
- But they'll be all right.
- Fuck.

86
00:10:21,764 --> 00:10:24,564
Ambushed them as they
were coming to get breakfast.

87
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:26,233
Surrounded the truck.

88
00:10:26,235 --> 00:10:28,902
This poor fool right here was trying
to do what he gets paid to do.

89
00:10:28,904 --> 00:10:32,272
AP rounds blasted through
the windshield took him out.

90
00:10:32,274 --> 00:10:36,075
They took the truck, Gardena police
lost them under Hawthorne Municipal.

91
00:10:36,077 --> 00:10:37,444
They knew the route.

92
00:10:37,446 --> 00:10:40,413
Picked it because it was
next to Municipal Airport,

93
00:10:40,415 --> 00:10:43,919
knew the restricted air space
meant no ghetto bird air support.

94
00:10:45,586 --> 00:10:48,854
We're dealing with a different
animal here, boys.

95
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:51,191
Talk to the armored car company?
What was the haul?

96
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:53,759
They were en route to a bank
pickup for a Fed drop.

97
00:10:53,761 --> 00:10:55,121
But there was nothing
in the truck.

98
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:56,799
Nothing in the truck?

99
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:00,803
They stole a fucking
empty armored truck?

100
00:11:01,102 --> 00:11:02,402
Yup.

101
00:11:04,273 --> 00:11:06,273
Why the fireworks?

102
00:11:06,275 --> 00:11:09,396
One of the vics said the messenger went
for his gun. That's when it popped off.

103
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:11,611
Genius.

104
00:11:11,613 --> 00:11:13,613
Okay, the SUV,
what have we got?

105
00:11:13,615 --> 00:11:15,382
That's a cold car.

106
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:18,584
VIN's been pried off. Plates are stolen.
No prints on it.

107
00:11:18,586 --> 00:11:20,253
They bleach-bombed it.

108
00:11:20,255 --> 00:11:25,492
Right. Take it to SID. Tent that fucker.
Swab it. Detail it.

109
00:11:33,968 --> 00:11:37,269
Ah, fuck. I can't deal with
this retard factory this early.

110
00:11:37,271 --> 00:11:38,971
One of you guys handle it?

111
00:11:38,973 --> 00:11:40,108
It's all you, bro.

112
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,143
Thank you.

113
00:11:43,145 --> 00:11:45,745
All right, witnesses,
donut shop guy?

114
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,413
He saw them, and they
looked right at him,

115
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,151
but, for some reason,
they left him alone.

116
00:11:52,487 --> 00:11:55,855
Okay, pull all video surveillance and
plate readers. Do a Palantir run.

117
00:11:55,857 --> 00:11:57,157
Talk to DOT, okay?

118
00:11:57,159 --> 00:12:00,426
Pull it all together,
and meet me at the office.

119
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,332
And find me
that fucking truck.

120
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:10,170
Big Nick, original gangsta
cop in the flesh.

121
00:12:10,172 --> 00:12:12,439
Lobbin' Bob. Huh?

122
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:14,177
How's that
mean tennis game?

123
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:21,181
Look at you, man.

124
00:12:21,183 --> 00:12:23,016
Where'd you pick that up?
Nice suit.

125
00:12:23,018 --> 00:12:26,385
Well, not where you're shopping.
I can't afford it.

126
00:12:26,387 --> 00:12:28,821
I mean, how does
a county sheriff

127
00:12:28,823 --> 00:12:31,523
pay for such a beautiful
piece of men's fashion?

128
00:12:31,525 --> 00:12:33,893
You kidding me? This piece of shit?
Nah, this is garbage.

129
00:12:33,895 --> 00:12:35,128
Look at you.

130
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,163
This thing's tits!

131
00:12:37,165 --> 00:12:40,532
You must pull all kinds
of ass sporting that, no?

132
00:12:40,534 --> 00:12:42,634
Nick, you know what?
I can't. I can't.

133
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:46,406
It's too early in the morning
for your fucking circus.

134
00:12:46,408 --> 00:12:48,709
You just threw
a donut in the hot zone.

135
00:12:48,711 --> 00:12:50,476
- No. I did not.
- Yeah, you did.

136
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,545
I did?
That was fucking wrong.

137
00:12:52,547 --> 00:12:54,880
It was. I don't like you, Nick, or
how you handle police business...

138
00:12:54,882 --> 00:12:56,684
Hey, hey, hey.
What's up with that?

139
00:12:57,486 --> 00:12:59,051
I like you.

140
00:12:59,053 --> 00:13:01,220
Aside from the fact
that you're a vegetarian.

141
00:13:01,222 --> 00:13:03,724
Vegan! I'm a vegan.

142
00:13:03,726 --> 00:13:05,825
- Vegetarians, they eat milk...
- Yeah, sorry to hear that.

143
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,893
What are you
doing here anyway, huh?

144
00:13:07,895 --> 00:13:11,600
No legal tender was stolen.
It isn't Federal.

145
00:13:12,735 --> 00:13:13,936
Yet.

146
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,673
You're pausing
for dramatic effect?

147
00:13:21,576 --> 00:13:23,246
You're such a big,
bad lieutenant.

148
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:26,178
- I know. I know.
- Yeah.

149
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,917
Can I go now, Dad?
I'm kind of hungry.

150
00:13:35,924 --> 00:13:38,457
So Gardena showed up,
and they secured the scene,

151
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:41,594
and then these clowns
took over.

152
00:13:41,596 --> 00:13:43,229
Who are they, LASD?

153
00:13:43,231 --> 00:13:46,099
Yeah, Sheriff's. They must be.
Look at this clown right here.

154
00:13:46,101 --> 00:13:47,370
He seemed to be in charge.

155
00:14:02,317 --> 00:14:04,316
You recognize him?

156
00:14:04,318 --> 00:14:06,485
He played football at South.

157
00:14:06,487 --> 00:14:09,458
Remember Endo?
Filipino dude the cops killed?

158
00:14:09,792 --> 00:14:11,224
Yeah.

159
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:13,225
That's the cop
who blasted him.

160
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,128
Runs Major Crimes.

161
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,966
Get to know your enemy, boys.

162
00:14:26,308 --> 00:14:28,774
Who's running this crew?

163
00:14:28,776 --> 00:14:31,344
Probably two, three guys
that can pull this off, max.

164
00:14:31,346 --> 00:14:36,316
Why steal an armored truck
with nothing in it?

165
00:14:36,318 --> 00:14:38,484
Bad tip,
they probably botched it.

166
00:14:38,486 --> 00:14:39,952
Why didn't they dump it then?

167
00:14:39,954 --> 00:14:42,122
- I'll check the salvage yards.
- All of them.

168
00:14:42,124 --> 00:14:46,359
And how'd they know about a transfer
from the casino to the Fed,

169
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:50,695
especially one that wasn't scheduled
through the regular carrier? How?

170
00:14:50,697 --> 00:14:53,200
It was an inside job, bro.
It had to be.

171
00:14:53,202 --> 00:14:56,168
Oh, fuck.
Give me the Pepto.

172
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,839
Okay, inside job, but where?

173
00:14:58,841 --> 00:15:02,677
Right? Was it the casino, the bank, the
Fed, the fucking donut shop? Where?

174
00:15:03,846 --> 00:15:05,280
What about Merrimen?

175
00:15:08,682 --> 00:15:10,349
When did he parole again?

176
00:15:10,351 --> 00:15:13,155
- Eight months ago.
- Eight months ago?

177
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,690
We need to find
that fucking truck.

178
00:15:17,692 --> 00:15:19,725
Have we still got a tail
on that Wilson kid?

179
00:15:19,727 --> 00:15:21,061
Yeah.

180
00:15:21,063 --> 00:15:22,061
The one who was
hanging out with Merrimen?

181
00:15:22,063 --> 00:15:23,695
What bar did he work in?

182
00:15:23,697 --> 00:15:26,699
- Hofbrau.
- Ziggy's Hofbrau.

183
00:15:26,702 --> 00:15:28,037
Let's pay him a visit.

184
00:15:38,413 --> 00:15:41,550
Some Wi-Fi? No?
We better check his videos.

185
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:45,721
- Thanks.
- All right.

186
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,388
Wolfgang, talk to me.

187
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,422
- Donnie, I'm tapped out.
- No problem.

188
00:15:50,424 --> 00:15:52,057
Put it on my tab, all right?

189
00:15:52,059 --> 00:15:53,658
- Of course, man, I got you.
- Thank you.

190
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,896
Have a good night.

191
00:16:07,074 --> 00:16:08,173
Are we doing this?

192
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,778
Yeah, man. All right, man.

193
00:16:10,577 --> 00:16:12,578
To money and women.

194
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,783
That we don't have.

195
00:16:17,251 --> 00:16:19,618
How do you remember
everybody's order like that?

196
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,221
I can't remember
the last four of my social.

197
00:16:22,223 --> 00:16:24,090
Lots of reps man.

198
00:16:24,092 --> 00:16:26,692
I'm in complete control of my environment.
People don't even know.

199
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,263
- Hey, man, time to go.
- Okay.

200
00:16:30,265 --> 00:16:31,433
Wrap it up.

201
00:16:32,768 --> 00:16:34,968
- Just a little bit.
- Yeah, yeah.

202
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,373
- Ziggy's going to kill me.
- Shit, not going to finish.

203
00:16:39,274 --> 00:16:40,443
A gift.

204
00:16:41,076 --> 00:16:42,374
How about a tip?

205
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,109
We got you last time.

206
00:16:44,111 --> 00:16:45,611
Oh, yeah, you got me last...

207
00:16:45,613 --> 00:16:47,049
That's not how it works.

208
00:16:50,485 --> 00:16:53,655
Okay, really? Zoo animals.

209
00:16:59,126 --> 00:17:00,395
Need change?

210
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,132
That's for you, Fräulein.

211
00:17:05,133 --> 00:17:06,434
Thanks.

212
00:17:07,802 --> 00:17:10,635
Are there always
so many cops in here?

213
00:17:10,637 --> 00:17:13,006
Last place
I'd think they'd be.

214
00:17:13,008 --> 00:17:16,075
Yeah, this their spot.
You know, cheap liquor.

215
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,010
Right.

216
00:17:18,012 --> 00:17:21,016
Yeah, there also is a lot of
shady cats in here, huh?

217
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:26,318
Yeah, it's kind of neutral
grounds, you know?

218
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,656
Rick's in Casablanca
type shit.

219
00:17:30,657 --> 00:17:33,360
You must've heard
some stories in this place.

220
00:17:33,362 --> 00:17:36,829
You know, give him a couple of
drinks, steak on his plate,

221
00:17:36,831 --> 00:17:38,596
some nice women around him,

222
00:17:38,598 --> 00:17:40,302
he'll tell you
his darkest secrets.

223
00:17:41,501 --> 00:17:43,004
Loose lips sink ships.

224
00:17:43,704 --> 00:17:45,174
Ain't that the truth.

225
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,277
Mmm, what about you?

226
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:53,479
Pull a lot of pussy
in here? Yeah?

227
00:17:53,481 --> 00:17:54,546
Come on.

228
00:17:54,548 --> 00:17:56,352
- I do well for myself.
- Yeah.

229
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:58,653
I'd fuck you.

230
00:18:01,521 --> 00:18:02,791
Kidding.

231
00:18:07,895 --> 00:18:09,130
All right.

232
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:12,634
I'm out.

233
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,871
See you later, man.

234
00:18:17,873 --> 00:18:19,241
Yeah.

235
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,044
Look forward to it.

236
00:18:49,603 --> 00:18:51,741
- Fräulein.
- Dude, what the fuck are you...

237
00:19:10,258 --> 00:19:12,057
What the fuck?

238
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:33,113
What's up, gangster?

239
00:19:33,115 --> 00:19:34,213
Oh, Peaches.

240
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:37,584
Oh, Fräulein, you're up.

241
00:19:39,087 --> 00:19:40,955
Sit down.
You sit right there.

242
00:19:44,126 --> 00:19:45,959
What you walking
so slow for, nigga?

243
00:19:45,961 --> 00:19:48,463
I want you to sit right there.
That's you right there.

244
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,169
- Look here. There's cigarettes.
- Yeah.

245
00:19:55,136 --> 00:19:57,470
Borracho!

246
00:19:57,472 --> 00:19:59,641
I think y'all got me
confused with somebody.

247
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,315
Why my pants wet?

248
00:20:09,984 --> 00:20:12,683
Come on, man, if you and
your Uncle Tom over here

249
00:20:12,685 --> 00:20:14,787
are into some
homo shit, I'm good.

250
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:16,125
Y'all just kill me now.

251
00:20:16,991 --> 00:20:18,461
You pissed yourself, bubba.

252
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,493
It happens.

253
00:20:21,495 --> 00:20:24,831
I had one of the girls here
clean you up, so you're good.

254
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:27,166
But y'all got the wrong dude.

255
00:20:27,168 --> 00:20:29,500
You got me confused
with someone.

256
00:20:29,502 --> 00:20:32,005
But I'm going to let you know
now, I ain't the one.

257
00:20:32,007 --> 00:20:33,671
What'd you say?

258
00:20:33,673 --> 00:20:35,507
Dude something?

259
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:38,512
No, we're not mistaking you for anybody.
Don't be a fucking smartass.

260
00:20:40,014 --> 00:20:42,680
Arrested at 17 for GTA.

261
00:20:42,682 --> 00:20:45,151
Tried and convicted
as an adult.

262
00:20:45,153 --> 00:20:46,517
We know exactly who you are.

263
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:48,653
Did a stint at county
for attempted manslaughter.

264
00:20:48,655 --> 00:20:51,623
Fastest speeding ticket
in California history.

265
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,791
That's nice.

266
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,863
Fucking genius, man.
How fast were you going?

267
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,631
178.

268
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:02,738
Speed demon!

269
00:21:05,373 --> 00:21:07,039
What did you say to the cop
who pulled you over?

270
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:08,201
What reason did you give him?

271
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,077
Told him they'd
just paved the road.

272
00:21:13,248 --> 00:21:14,814
- I like him.
- Ballsy.

273
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:16,216
Me gusta.

274
00:21:16,218 --> 00:21:18,418
You may have a little pecker
for a black dude.

275
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:22,387
You may be a bed-wetter, but you've
got some fucking style, buddy.

276
00:21:22,389 --> 00:21:26,425
All right, girls, time to go.

277
00:21:26,427 --> 00:21:28,760
Grab your shoes. Grab your shit.
Let's go.

278
00:21:28,762 --> 00:21:30,095
Time to go home
to your babies.

279
00:21:30,097 --> 00:21:32,017
- All right, thanks for stopping by.
- Excuse me.

280
00:21:39,941 --> 00:21:43,175
You check this out, hot rod.
You're a two-striker.

281
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:45,777
You need to fucking look at me
when I'm talking to you.

282
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:50,415
You're one mistake away from getting
sex in the ass every time you shower.

283
00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:53,920
Some of them niggas
got gas pumps.

284
00:21:53,922 --> 00:21:58,790
Now, personally, that shit don't
sound like a lot of fun to me.

285
00:21:58,792 --> 00:22:00,762
What you think?
How you feel about that?

286
00:22:03,097 --> 00:22:06,199
Look, the dude in that picture
is not even a regular at my bar.

287
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:10,870
Like, I've seen him a few times, but,
you know, I don't associate myself...

288
00:22:17,611 --> 00:22:18,948
Do you know what this means?

289
00:22:20,949 --> 00:22:23,316
It means I am
a member of a clique.

290
00:22:23,318 --> 00:22:25,317
It's kind of like
being in a gang.

291
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:28,954
Sort of like a gang,
only we have badges,

292
00:22:28,956 --> 00:22:31,826
which means you are done.

293
00:22:33,127 --> 00:22:34,329
He ain't lying.

294
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,300
Let me ask you this.

295
00:22:41,302 --> 00:22:44,503
Okay, do we look like the
types who will arrest you?

296
00:22:44,505 --> 00:22:47,609
Put you in handcuffs,
drag you down to the station?

297
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,810
I'm asking you
a fucking question.

298
00:22:51,812 --> 00:22:53,845
No. Not at all.

299
00:22:53,847 --> 00:22:56,449
Right, exactly.

300
00:22:56,451 --> 00:22:59,822
We just shoot you.
It's less paperwork.

301
00:23:02,123 --> 00:23:03,459
So tell me,

302
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,964
what the fuck are you doing
hanging out in that crew?

303
00:23:10,865 --> 00:23:12,464
You're a pussy.

304
00:23:12,466 --> 00:23:14,665
Those dudes are bad dudes.

305
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:18,770
Great thieves
but straight convicts.

306
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:21,672
What's Merrimen doing drinking
beers with the likes of you for?

307
00:23:21,674 --> 00:23:22,842
Talk shop?

308
00:23:22,844 --> 00:23:24,810
You gonna hit
the fucking Hofbrau?

309
00:23:24,812 --> 00:23:27,880
Take the place down, score, like,
what, two grand in ones and fives?

310
00:23:27,882 --> 00:23:29,315
Is that what's afoot?
I'll answer that for you.

311
00:23:29,317 --> 00:23:30,986
No, it fucking isn't.

312
00:23:32,854 --> 00:23:35,387
I don't know what crew
you're speaking about, man.

313
00:23:35,389 --> 00:23:37,356
This dude just comes to
my bar where I work...

314
00:23:37,358 --> 00:23:40,662
Stop. Shut up.

315
00:23:47,667 --> 00:23:49,402
Come on, man. This is
some weird shit. Just...

316
00:23:49,404 --> 00:23:52,305
You listen to me, fuckface.

317
00:23:52,307 --> 00:23:54,039
We don't give
a shit about you.

318
00:23:56,845 --> 00:23:58,377
You in Merrimen's crew?

319
00:24:00,547 --> 00:24:02,680
Huh? You hit the stadium?

320
00:24:04,385 --> 00:24:06,184
You talky-talky now?

321
00:24:06,186 --> 00:24:07,554
Yes, please.

322
00:24:13,728 --> 00:24:14,763
Fuck!

323
00:24:22,737 --> 00:24:24,202
I'm just the driver!

324
00:24:24,204 --> 00:24:26,772
I'm just the driver!

325
00:24:26,774 --> 00:24:29,574
They don't give me no gun.
I don't do no gangster shit.

326
00:24:29,576 --> 00:24:31,943
They asked me to drive,
so that's what I do.

327
00:24:31,945 --> 00:24:34,546
That's it. Fuck!

328
00:24:34,548 --> 00:24:37,450
Why did Merrimen hijack
an empty armored car?

329
00:24:37,452 --> 00:24:39,085
I don't know, all right?

330
00:24:39,087 --> 00:24:40,952
They keep me in the dark
for shit like this.

331
00:24:40,954 --> 00:24:42,220
If the cops come down on me,

332
00:24:42,222 --> 00:24:44,257
I can't tell them shit
if I don't know shit.

333
00:24:44,259 --> 00:24:46,557
Now y'all can hook me up
to a lie detector,

334
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,795
a fucking polygraph,
whatever y'all got.

335
00:24:48,797 --> 00:24:51,864
I'm telling you what I know,
and that's all you'll get.

336
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:53,769
Please, just let me
the fuck go.

337
00:24:55,936 --> 00:24:59,107
Fuck y'all, man.
Let me go.

338
00:25:00,942 --> 00:25:04,110
Well, I thought that was
relatively convincing, hmm?

339
00:25:04,112 --> 00:25:05,314
Good stuff.

340
00:25:07,281 --> 00:25:08,561
All right,
when did you meet him?

341
00:25:09,451 --> 00:25:11,083
What do I get out of this?

342
00:25:11,085 --> 00:25:15,124
What do you get out of this?
Well, your freedom for one.

343
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:17,826
Two,

344
00:25:20,327 --> 00:25:21,797
you're not the bad guys.

345
00:25:22,628 --> 00:25:23,799
We are.

346
00:25:29,337 --> 00:25:32,603
Couple months ago,
they came through the bar,

347
00:25:32,605 --> 00:25:34,973
and I served them
a few drinks.

348
00:25:34,975 --> 00:25:36,641
We started talking.

349
00:25:36,643 --> 00:25:38,478
This is my boy, Bosco.

350
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,949
My brother for life.
We deployed together.

351
00:25:42,349 --> 00:25:44,118
Hey, the kid can drive.

352
00:25:45,652 --> 00:25:47,487
Okay.

353
00:25:47,489 --> 00:25:50,489
Donnie, tell him about
the Trans Am Series.

354
00:25:50,491 --> 00:25:53,661
Drove Trans Am Series, like
he said, for about a season.

355
00:25:54,362 --> 00:25:55,831
What were their names?

356
00:25:56,964 --> 00:25:58,665
Hawaiian dude,

357
00:25:59,834 --> 00:26:01,870
he had a homie,
Bosco, white boy.

358
00:26:03,537 --> 00:26:07,105
He was in the military,
and he worked for DWP.

359
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,144
I told him I needed
some extra money,

360
00:26:10,043 --> 00:26:12,010
so he gave me a job.

361
00:26:12,012 --> 00:26:14,348
Who's that? Merrimen?

362
00:26:15,516 --> 00:26:16,985
Merrimen.

363
00:26:17,952 --> 00:26:19,852
Ray Merrimen.

364
00:26:27,693 --> 00:26:29,495
So what's up with this dude?

365
00:26:29,497 --> 00:26:30,731
It's Marcus' boy.

366
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:35,699
Worked with him
over at the Hofbrau.

367
00:26:35,702 --> 00:26:38,336
Say he did some time
with him at Wayside.

368
00:26:38,338 --> 00:26:39,539
He was a Marine for a minute.

369
00:26:42,542 --> 00:26:44,678
Say the nigga can drive.
He be cool.

370
00:26:46,047 --> 00:26:49,751
All right,
let's check him out.

371
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:53,385
Real smart dude.

372
00:26:53,387 --> 00:26:55,723
He had just got out of prison
from what I could tell.

373
00:27:02,062 --> 00:27:03,397
You ready to roll, Ray?

374
00:27:04,065 --> 00:27:05,067
514!

375
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,775
Come on, let's cuff them up.

376
00:27:31,925 --> 00:27:33,261
See you soon, Ray.

377
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:40,766
No, you won't.

378
00:27:40,768 --> 00:27:42,401
Where'd you meet him?

379
00:27:42,403 --> 00:27:45,136
It was in Carson,
at the Hawaiian dude's house.

380
00:27:48,276 --> 00:27:50,442
- Donnie, what's good, man?
- What's up?

381
00:27:50,444 --> 00:27:52,213
- Come on, man. Follow me.
- Yeah, yeah.

382
00:27:54,915 --> 00:27:56,117
Hey.

383
00:27:57,285 --> 00:27:59,451
Oh, shit. What's up?

384
00:27:59,453 --> 00:28:01,455
- Donnie, beer?
- Yeah, yeah.

385
00:28:02,588 --> 00:28:03,624
Thank you. Thank you.

386
00:28:12,633 --> 00:28:14,501
So you spent
some time at Wayside?

387
00:28:15,168 --> 00:28:16,603
Yeah, a little bit.

388
00:28:18,306 --> 00:28:20,475
What do they serve
for breakfast on Fridays?

389
00:28:26,013 --> 00:28:27,979
Silver dollar pancakes.

390
00:28:27,981 --> 00:28:29,151
Three of them.

391
00:28:31,318 --> 00:28:32,320
Where you from?

392
00:28:32,787 --> 00:28:33,855
Hawthorne.

393
00:28:35,822 --> 00:28:37,358
So you can drive, huh?

394
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,492
Oh, I can drive.

395
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,533
Drive.

396
00:28:48,535 --> 00:28:50,504
You might want to
put that seat belt on.

397
00:29:33,881 --> 00:29:37,883
He liked how I drove, so, a
week later, I did my first gig.

398
00:29:37,885 --> 00:29:39,887
We hit this rave at a stadium.

399
00:30:09,951 --> 00:30:11,219
Got one.

400
00:30:32,306 --> 00:30:34,809
Minus the dye pack,
is the count all good?

401
00:30:37,411 --> 00:30:38,947
The count is on.

402
00:30:44,385 --> 00:30:46,951
That's a lot of money
right there, bro.

403
00:30:46,953 --> 00:30:48,953
Why don't we
just call it a day?

404
00:30:48,955 --> 00:30:50,823
Really?

405
00:30:50,825 --> 00:30:53,258
You want three in hot bills,

406
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:56,295
you looking over your shoulder
for the rest of your life,

407
00:30:56,297 --> 00:30:58,333
or would you rather
have 30 clean?

408
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,935
I'm just saying.

409
00:31:02,669 --> 00:31:04,672
Let's just call it quits
while we're ahead.

410
00:31:07,441 --> 00:31:08,477
Put it away.

411
00:31:09,477 --> 00:31:10,779
We're trading up.

412
00:31:14,182 --> 00:31:17,152
All right. Fuck it.
Let's do it.

413
00:31:18,452 --> 00:31:20,185
What happened to the cash?

414
00:31:20,187 --> 00:31:21,521
I don't know.

415
00:31:22,155 --> 00:31:23,624
They don't tell me.

416
00:31:24,657 --> 00:31:26,160
They don't talk much.

417
00:31:28,662 --> 00:31:31,664
Yeah, people with things to
hide never have much to say.

418
00:31:34,468 --> 00:31:37,873
So am I under arrest,
or can I leave?

419
00:31:40,808 --> 00:31:43,275
Nah, you just keep
doing your thing.

420
00:31:43,277 --> 00:31:44,545
We'll be in touch.

421
00:32:02,029 --> 00:32:03,996
Yeah?

422
00:32:03,998 --> 00:32:07,169
Horsepower, be at 1st and
Central at 0800. Don't be late.

423
00:33:41,295 --> 00:33:42,297
Jesus Christ!

424
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:46,666
You scared the shit out of me,
babe. Can't do that.

425
00:33:47,501 --> 00:33:49,170
What are you doing right now?

426
00:33:54,507 --> 00:33:56,144
You erasing your recent calls?

427
00:33:59,347 --> 00:34:02,146
My phone? What do you mean?

428
00:34:02,148 --> 00:34:04,983
I don't know how to work this
fucking thing. You know that.

429
00:34:04,985 --> 00:34:07,319
I don't know how to work this
fucking thing. You know that.

430
00:34:07,321 --> 00:34:08,489
Come on.

431
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:13,491
Babe, we really have
to go through this right now?

432
00:34:13,493 --> 00:34:14,527
Where you been?

433
00:34:17,832 --> 00:34:20,167
It's 6:00 a.m.
Where have you been?

434
00:34:21,368 --> 00:34:23,134
Been at work?

435
00:34:23,136 --> 00:34:27,006
Surveillance? Robbing drug dealers?
Because you smell like a stripper.

436
00:34:27,008 --> 00:34:28,509
Of course, I was at work.

437
00:34:33,646 --> 00:34:34,967
It's funny
'cause I got this text.

438
00:34:37,318 --> 00:34:38,686
What was so hot then?

439
00:34:39,352 --> 00:34:40,722
Is that a work text?

440
00:34:47,194 --> 00:34:49,693
You fucked up.
You text me instead.

441
00:34:52,565 --> 00:34:53,868
Who does that?

442
00:34:59,874 --> 00:35:03,042
It's street theater, babe.
It's not what it looks like.

443
00:35:03,044 --> 00:35:04,078
I'm sorry.

444
00:35:05,011 --> 00:35:06,214
Me too.

445
00:35:18,225 --> 00:35:20,028
Fuck.

446
00:35:21,928 --> 00:35:23,428
We're going
to go to Auntie's house

447
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,830
because Daddy's got to do
a little work on the house.

448
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,265
And we have
something else to do.

449
00:35:27,267 --> 00:35:28,568
- Come on.
- What the fuck?

450
00:35:29,536 --> 00:35:31,203
Hey, yo.

451
00:35:31,205 --> 00:35:33,071
It's gonna be too loud
for you guys, okay?

452
00:35:33,073 --> 00:35:35,406
- Deb? Deb?
- Will you put this on?

453
00:35:35,408 --> 00:35:36,774
- Is Daddy coming with us?
- What are you doing, Deb?

454
00:35:36,776 --> 00:35:39,044
What the fuck are you doing?

455
00:35:39,046 --> 00:35:40,545
- It will be too loud for you guys.
- Wifey, wifey.

456
00:35:40,547 --> 00:35:42,082
Seriously,
what are you doing?

457
00:35:43,084 --> 00:35:44,548
Is Daddy coming with us?

458
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,350
No, Daddy does not have
enough time for us right now.

459
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,754
- Seriously... That's nice. That's nice.
- Can you put this on here?

460
00:35:48,756 --> 00:35:50,788
Hey, honey.
Mommy didn't mean that, okay?

461
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:53,759
Hey, sweetie, come here.
Mommy didn't mean that, okay?

462
00:35:53,761 --> 00:35:57,065
She didn't mean that, okay?
Sweetie, you okay?

463
00:35:58,466 --> 00:35:59,797
Yeah, great. Great.

464
00:35:59,799 --> 00:36:02,100
Hey. Come here, honey.

465
00:36:02,102 --> 00:36:03,601
I'm not going to be able
to make it right now,

466
00:36:03,603 --> 00:36:05,770
but I'm gonna come
a little later, okay?

467
00:36:05,772 --> 00:36:07,272
All right. Come here.
Give me a hug.

468
00:36:07,274 --> 00:36:09,207
- Time to go right now.
- Christ sake.

469
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:10,776
Will you slow it down
a second?

470
00:36:10,778 --> 00:36:12,143
Give Daddy some rest.
He's real tired.

471
00:36:12,145 --> 00:36:13,779
- Right, hon?
- What...

472
00:36:13,781 --> 00:36:16,985
Deb. Deb. Deb, will you
slow it down a second?

473
00:36:18,118 --> 00:36:19,617
- We're going to walk this way...
- Deb.

474
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:21,886
Okay, watch your step.
Here we go.

475
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,288
Deb, can you slow it...

476
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:25,655
Okay. Come on.

477
00:36:25,657 --> 00:36:27,426
Let's go. We're going to
put your sister in first.

478
00:36:27,428 --> 00:36:29,761
Here we go. Okay, baby, ready?

479
00:36:29,763 --> 00:36:31,763
Sweetie, it's going to be
okay, sweetie. Okay?

480
00:36:31,765 --> 00:36:33,630
Let's go.

481
00:36:33,632 --> 00:36:36,767
Okay, put your bags in there. You
wanna put your sister in the seat?

482
00:36:36,769 --> 00:36:37,838
Where's the pink bag?

483
00:36:38,973 --> 00:36:41,105
Have you lost
your fucking mind?

484
00:36:41,107 --> 00:36:43,174
Oh, great language right
in front of my daughter.

485
00:36:43,176 --> 00:36:44,608
Great fathering!

486
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,477
Nice. Nice. Dropping F-bombs
in front of my daughters.

487
00:36:46,479 --> 00:36:49,448
- My kids, huh? My kids?
- Great fathering!

488
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:52,486
Gonna find a guy whose cock
actually gets hard for me.

489
00:36:53,821 --> 00:36:55,622
Deb, Deb, Deb. Stop!

490
00:36:56,523 --> 00:36:57,826
Please don't do this.

491
00:36:59,659 --> 00:37:01,196
Please.

492
00:37:13,807 --> 00:37:17,142
This is a little hard. You're just
scared right now, okay? You're confused.

493
00:37:17,144 --> 00:37:18,145
Okay...

494
00:37:21,214 --> 00:37:23,055
Out of the way, Nick.
Get out of the way, Nick.

495
00:37:25,218 --> 00:37:27,517
Get the fuck
out of here, you fucker!

496
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:29,120
You motherfucker!

497
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:33,225
You get back! You understand
me, you motherfucker?

498
00:37:34,361 --> 00:37:35,695
- Stay away from us!
- Nice. Nice.

499
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:37,664
Good. Good.

500
00:37:44,904 --> 00:37:46,874
Okay. Mommy's okay.

501
00:37:56,249 --> 00:37:57,550
See you later.

502
00:38:03,723 --> 00:38:05,193
Perfect.

503
00:38:08,695 --> 00:38:10,064
Morning.

504
00:38:29,883 --> 00:38:32,550
Ran the prints on CAL-ID.

505
00:38:32,552 --> 00:38:34,953
Got a hit on our
dead guy from Angel City.

506
00:38:34,955 --> 00:38:38,555
- Check your e-mail.
- All right.

507
00:38:38,557 --> 00:38:41,626
Name's Marcus Rhodes,
from Oakland.

508
00:38:41,628 --> 00:38:44,561
ATF was looking for him
for gun charges.

509
00:38:44,563 --> 00:38:46,765
And more to the point
that you were making before,

510
00:38:46,767 --> 00:38:50,534
he was stationed at Twentynine Palms
the same time Merrimen was there.

511
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,457
This is good.
Give me the book on Merrimen.

512
00:38:56,075 --> 00:38:57,411
Look to your right.

513
00:38:58,379 --> 00:38:59,944
You know what that is?

514
00:38:59,946 --> 00:39:02,480
It's the bank for banks.

515
00:39:02,482 --> 00:39:05,951
Los Angeles branch
of the Federal Reserve.

516
00:39:05,953 --> 00:39:08,089
It's the only bank
that's never been robbed.

517
00:39:15,828 --> 00:39:18,430
All the surrounding streets
are wired for sound and image.

518
00:39:18,432 --> 00:39:21,433
Stand across the street and stare
at the building for two minutes,

519
00:39:21,435 --> 00:39:24,236
you'll have security on your ass
asking you politely to leave.

520
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:26,138
If they see your face again,

521
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:29,308
every Secret Service agent in the
country is going to be looking for you.

522
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:30,311
The place is case-proof.

523
00:39:33,013 --> 00:39:36,948
There have been
53 break-in attempts.

524
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:38,752
Not one has
got past the lobby.

525
00:39:42,156 --> 00:39:43,791
That's why
we're going to rob it.

526
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:47,091
Okay, here we go.

527
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,361
Laguna Niguel was in '06.

528
00:39:49,363 --> 00:39:52,964
Got caught for that, get sent
up to USP Victorville SHU

529
00:39:52,966 --> 00:39:55,834
until June of '16.
Now give me the unsolved book.

530
00:39:55,836 --> 00:39:57,868
As soon as
you enter the lobby,

531
00:39:57,870 --> 00:40:00,471
computers run you through every law
enforcement database in the country.

532
00:40:00,473 --> 00:40:02,639
If you've got outstanding
parking tickets,

533
00:40:02,641 --> 00:40:05,508
they're going to know about it before you
get through the first level of security.

534
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:07,946
All the employees wear
security swipe cards

535
00:40:07,948 --> 00:40:10,181
that grant them access through
the first set of man-traps.

536
00:40:10,183 --> 00:40:13,185
Access is severely restricted.

537
00:40:13,187 --> 00:40:15,453
Two stories below street level
is the vault floor.

538
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:16,657
By the way,

539
00:40:18,157 --> 00:40:19,357
his crimey...

540
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:20,461
- Levoux?
- Levoux.

541
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,060
He serve with Merrimen?

542
00:40:23,062 --> 00:40:26,330
Not only that, but they played football
in high school at Long Beach Poly.

543
00:40:26,332 --> 00:40:28,734
- You've got to be shitting me.
- No.

544
00:40:28,736 --> 00:40:32,303
Central Security, it's
the nerve center for the Fed.

545
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:36,207
This is where the armored cars
come in, drop off the money tubs.

546
00:40:36,209 --> 00:40:38,410
Money tubs are handed off
to the Fed employees.

547
00:40:38,412 --> 00:40:44,015
At any one time, there's anywhere between
500 and 800 billion dollars in there,

548
00:40:44,017 --> 00:40:47,650
every millimeter of it covered by
cameras, sensors, and motion detectors.

549
00:40:47,652 --> 00:40:49,354
Yeah. What did they
specialize in?

550
00:40:49,356 --> 00:40:52,991
I got this from the HR desk
at Twentynine Palms.

551
00:40:52,993 --> 00:40:56,594
Close Quarter Battle Unit. Both
saw combat in the Middle East.

552
00:40:56,596 --> 00:41:01,031
Levoux specializes in explosives, where
Merrimen specializes in soldiering,

553
00:41:01,033 --> 00:41:03,901
both MARSOC fast Marines.

554
00:41:03,903 --> 00:41:05,736
But there's a hitch.

555
00:41:05,738 --> 00:41:09,040
The serial number of every bill is
recorded in the Fed's database.

556
00:41:09,042 --> 00:41:10,442
So, if a note goes missing,

557
00:41:10,444 --> 00:41:11,942
they're going to know
exactly which one it is.

558
00:41:11,944 --> 00:41:14,677
They're going to flag it.
If that bill comes up again,

559
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:17,680
whoever recirculates that cash, no
matter where they are in the world,

560
00:41:17,682 --> 00:41:18,917
that person can be tracked.

561
00:41:18,919 --> 00:41:21,218
Okay. Bosco,
the peckerwood?

562
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:24,388
He's a Huntington Beach kid,
also MARSOC Marines.

563
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:27,091
He did comms with them.
He had a solid career.

564
00:41:27,093 --> 00:41:29,227
But he didn't serve together
with the other guys.

565
00:41:29,229 --> 00:41:31,863
He was the Wood Rep at Victorville
when Merrimen was there.

566
00:41:31,865 --> 00:41:33,864
That's where they linked up.

567
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:37,601
Donnie was a Marine for a
year and a half, then discharged.

568
00:41:37,603 --> 00:41:39,303
So, the way I see it,

569
00:41:39,305 --> 00:41:41,071
that's the way all these niggas
ended up working together.

570
00:41:41,073 --> 00:41:44,308
There's only two passports on the
streets, sports and military.

571
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:47,078
Every time the Fed receives
a deposit from a bank,

572
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,980
first thing they do is send that
money up to the count rooms.

573
00:41:49,982 --> 00:41:52,317
They run the notes
through the counting machines.

574
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:54,084
They're accomplishing
two things here.

575
00:41:54,086 --> 00:41:56,653
First, they're double-checking the
accuracy of the bank's deposit.

576
00:41:56,655 --> 00:41:58,223
If the bank is off at all,

577
00:41:58,225 --> 00:42:00,058
they're going to credit or
debit the account accordingly.

578
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:05,796
Two, they're separating newer, fit
currency from old unfit bills.

579
00:42:05,798 --> 00:42:08,433
But most importantly, they're
erasing the serial numbers

580
00:42:08,435 --> 00:42:10,734
of the old bills
from the Fed system.

581
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:14,637
Once those numbers are erased, to
the Fed, to the rest of the world,

582
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:16,942
that money
has ceased to exist.

583
00:42:16,944 --> 00:42:18,508
Wait, let's look at
the unsolved cases.

584
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:22,913
In '04, you have the Boller
National Bank Hollywood job, okay?

585
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,615
They tunneled through
the sewer system.

586
00:42:24,617 --> 00:42:28,686
Sophisticated, skill set,
someone with access, unsolved.

587
00:42:28,688 --> 00:42:32,357
Okay, in '05, you have the
Fuerte armored car depot job.

588
00:42:32,359 --> 00:42:34,459
Blew the depot vault
with shaped charges.

589
00:42:34,461 --> 00:42:36,428
In the $100 count room alone,

590
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:41,098
an average of $30 million is
designated as unfit every day.

591
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,599
Between 4:00 p.m.
and 5:00 p.m.,

592
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:44,938
all the cash gets shot out
to the shredder.

593
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:46,808
It's all destroyed.

594
00:42:48,174 --> 00:42:54,044
$30 million
turned to dust in seconds.

595
00:42:54,046 --> 00:42:56,348
It's then picked up by the
Fed's waste management company

596
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:57,718
and brought out to the dump.

597
00:42:59,386 --> 00:43:01,386
If we can get to
those unfit bills

598
00:43:01,388 --> 00:43:04,688
before they go to the shredders
and get out clean...

599
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:07,459
You got $30 million
nobody is looking for.

600
00:43:07,461 --> 00:43:08,659
Bingo.

601
00:43:08,661 --> 00:43:11,029
In '06,
you have Laguna Niguel.

602
00:43:11,031 --> 00:43:14,697
Same thing, only this time Merrimen
gets unlucky with the tail-light.

603
00:43:14,699 --> 00:43:19,703
Goes to prison till 2016. Now in
that time, while he was in prison,

604
00:43:19,705 --> 00:43:22,806
how many highly sophisticated,
well-executed heists do we have?

605
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:24,541
None, but you're
on a roll. Keep going.

606
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:28,480
The counter guy at the donut shop?
Witness to the whole thing.

607
00:43:28,482 --> 00:43:29,549
They left him. Why?

608
00:43:32,419 --> 00:43:36,020
Because they shoot uniforms,
not unarmed civilians.

609
00:43:36,022 --> 00:43:37,758
Exactly what
they were trained to do.

610
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:40,327
Gangbangers, these are not.

611
00:43:41,261 --> 00:43:45,763
Okay, these are our guys.

612
00:43:45,765 --> 00:43:49,736
We nail these guys,
we solve all these cases.

613
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:52,707
This is the crew.

614
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:57,444
You still haven't told us how
you can get past that security.

615
00:43:58,946 --> 00:44:00,748
We're not going in this way.

616
00:44:03,283 --> 00:44:04,952
We're going in that way.

617
00:44:14,928 --> 00:44:16,727
What's going on
with Fräulein?

618
00:44:16,729 --> 00:44:18,631
We can move on him
anytime we want.

619
00:44:20,632 --> 00:44:22,566
- I pay minimum wage.
- Okay.

620
00:44:22,568 --> 00:44:25,937
Plus $3 for delivery.
And you split the tip with me.

621
00:44:25,939 --> 00:44:28,073
You start Wednesday, 11:00.

622
00:44:28,075 --> 00:44:29,808
Thank you.

623
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:31,776
I don't really like the
food there, but I'm down to go,

624
00:44:31,778 --> 00:44:33,877
- but you've got to pay this time.
- I'm not paying it.

625
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:35,312
What?

626
00:44:35,314 --> 00:44:37,982
- I pay every fucking time.
- What?

627
00:44:37,984 --> 00:44:39,317
Get off your wallet, buddy.

628
00:44:39,319 --> 00:44:40,986
No, I forgot my wallet today,
boys. I'm sorry.

629
00:44:40,988 --> 00:44:42,754
- Again?
- Yeah, again.

630
00:44:42,756 --> 00:44:44,055
Got an alligator arm.

631
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:47,424
I sat down at blackjack
with $5, and I made $160.

632
00:44:47,426 --> 00:44:49,062
Nicholas O'Brien?

633
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:52,096
Yeah?

634
00:44:52,098 --> 00:44:54,100
I suggest you take these.

635
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:56,669
You're being served.

636
00:44:57,803 --> 00:44:59,136
You kidding me?

637
00:44:59,138 --> 00:45:00,473
I'm afraid not.

638
00:45:02,675 --> 00:45:03,778
What's going on?

639
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,977
You all right, bro?

640
00:45:06,979 --> 00:45:08,448
Yeah, I guess
I'm getting divorced.

641
00:45:09,648 --> 00:45:11,084
He say divorced?

642
00:45:12,852 --> 00:45:14,120
Yo.

643
00:45:15,821 --> 00:45:17,821
Welcome to the fucking club.

644
00:45:17,823 --> 00:45:19,658
Now, go handle your business,
big man.

645
00:45:38,144 --> 00:45:40,712
There's a closer view.

646
00:45:40,714 --> 00:45:43,381
There was a rolling blackout in
this quadrant four days ago.

647
00:45:43,383 --> 00:45:45,316
Yeah, they've been happening a
lot over the last few months.

648
00:45:45,318 --> 00:45:47,017
Okay.

649
00:45:47,019 --> 00:45:49,453
They say they have full backup
power, but actually they don't.

650
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:52,655
- They go into brown-out.
- Yeah, prioritize the grid.

651
00:45:52,657 --> 00:45:55,693
Priority, of course, is the vault.
So everything in there stays intact.

652
00:45:55,695 --> 00:45:58,363
But anything that is peripheral,
like cameras in the hallway,

653
00:45:58,365 --> 00:46:01,532
shredders in the count rooms,
everything else cuts out.

654
00:46:01,534 --> 00:46:05,069
To time it during another rolling blackout
is going to be fucking impossible.

655
00:46:05,071 --> 00:46:07,872
- So you want to simulate it?
- Can we?

656
00:46:07,874 --> 00:46:09,908
Break in, have them go brown
for about two minutes.

657
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:13,078
I'd say yes, but I'd like
to have data to be sure.

658
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,644
Great.

659
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:17,047
Once we breach the count room,
only thing left is the cameras.

660
00:46:17,049 --> 00:46:18,883
They run on their
own power supply,

661
00:46:18,885 --> 00:46:21,486
so they're unaffected
by the brown-out.

662
00:46:21,488 --> 00:46:25,089
The solve here is
we run an EMP burst.

663
00:46:25,091 --> 00:46:28,525
Should take out the cameras
and motion for about 30 feet.

664
00:46:28,527 --> 00:46:30,563
Where you get all this
information from?

665
00:46:32,399 --> 00:46:34,565
You don't have to
worry about that.

666
00:46:34,567 --> 00:46:36,270
Just trust me
when I say it's solid.

667
00:46:37,937 --> 00:46:39,738
How we doing
with the Telecal hook?

668
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:42,109
Couple days.
Shouldn't be a problem.

669
00:46:44,377 --> 00:46:46,258
How many handlers do you need?

670
00:46:52,051 --> 00:46:53,491
Uh, gate B right now.

671
00:46:55,554 --> 00:46:58,259
Strolling right into
the Federal Reserve.

672
00:47:04,296 --> 00:47:06,232
Force leaving loading dock B.

673
00:47:19,145 --> 00:47:20,147
ID?

674
00:47:28,388 --> 00:47:29,589
Sign in, please.

675
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:41,664
Keep this on you
at all times.

676
00:47:41,666 --> 00:47:44,437
Second bay of elevators.
Cafeteria's level 2.

677
00:47:48,174 --> 00:47:49,443
Buzz him in. He's good.

678
00:47:50,977 --> 00:47:52,480
Smells good.

679
00:47:53,914 --> 00:47:55,149
He's good. Let him in.

680
00:48:14,801 --> 00:48:17,501
- Sharon?
- That's me.

681
00:48:17,503 --> 00:48:20,004
- How you all doing?
- Good. How you are doing today?

682
00:48:20,006 --> 00:48:22,443
- He's fine.
- Thank you.

683
00:48:23,176 --> 00:48:24,641
She ain't getting none.

684
00:48:24,643 --> 00:48:27,044
Shut up. Really?

685
00:48:27,046 --> 00:48:29,379
Y'all have a good day.
I'm gonna stay out of it.

686
00:48:29,381 --> 00:48:31,648
- We will now.
- You have a wonderful day.

687
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:35,018
Lunch. Dessert.
Lunch. Dessert.

688
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:36,022
Bye, sunshine.

689
00:49:08,321 --> 00:49:09,423
There he goes.

690
00:49:20,834 --> 00:49:22,870
My gosh.

691
00:49:34,714 --> 00:49:35,716
- Oh, he's here.
- Okay.

692
00:49:44,057 --> 00:49:46,790
Damn, girl looking fine.

693
00:49:46,792 --> 00:49:49,294
Thank you.
You look amazing.

694
00:49:49,296 --> 00:49:51,428
How are you?

695
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:53,263
- Looking good.
- Thank you.

696
00:49:53,265 --> 00:49:55,299
- This is my mom. This is Rolando.
- Hi.

697
00:49:55,301 --> 00:49:57,868
- Nice to meet you. Rolando.
- Hi, I'm Malia. Nice to meet you.

698
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:00,270
- I see where you get your looks from.
- Thank you.

699
00:50:02,776 --> 00:50:03,975
Thank you.

700
00:50:03,977 --> 00:50:05,812
- Can I take that?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

701
00:50:07,446 --> 00:50:10,147
Rolando,
this is my dad.

702
00:50:10,149 --> 00:50:13,453
What's up, Mr. Levoux?
Nice to meet you.

703
00:50:16,289 --> 00:50:18,657
Let me holler at him
for a second.

704
00:50:20,894 --> 00:50:22,328
Let me talk to you, bruh.

705
00:50:30,403 --> 00:50:33,473
Honey, don't worry about it.
Okay? They're just gonna talk.

706
00:50:41,612 --> 00:50:43,281
So here's what's up.

707
00:50:43,283 --> 00:50:45,249
For the past 16 years,

708
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:47,919
my daughter's safety and protection
has been my responsibility

709
00:50:47,921 --> 00:50:50,120
and my responsibility only.

710
00:50:50,122 --> 00:50:54,327
Now, for the first time in her life, I see
I've got to hand you that responsibility.

711
00:50:55,461 --> 00:50:56,794
Don't fuck up,

712
00:50:56,796 --> 00:50:58,495
or your mama
will weep as she has

713
00:50:58,497 --> 00:51:01,434
to wheel your ass around every
day the rest of your life.

714
00:51:04,203 --> 00:51:08,171
Now I worked on this, because I want to
say this to you as nice as possible.

715
00:51:08,173 --> 00:51:09,673
Do you understand?

716
00:51:09,675 --> 00:51:12,009
Yeah. Yes, sir.

717
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:19,317
It's all right.
It's all right.

718
00:51:19,319 --> 00:51:21,185
Listen. Listen.

719
00:51:21,187 --> 00:51:23,788
All he's trying to say is,
it's wonderful to meet you,

720
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:25,859
and he wants you
to have a beautiful evening.

721
00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:29,129
I'll see you at 11:30.

722
00:51:29,863 --> 00:51:31,361
Yeah. Yeah.

723
00:51:31,363 --> 00:51:34,133
11:30. Yeah. 11:30.
Good choice.

724
00:51:41,874 --> 00:51:43,542
I think he got
the picture, bro.

725
00:52:22,247 --> 00:52:24,015
Beers and sake,
let's go.

726
00:52:24,017 --> 00:52:26,453
- Have wine.
- What the fuck?

727
00:53:00,585 --> 00:53:01,586
Hey.

728
00:53:02,588 --> 00:53:03,623
Buddy.

729
00:53:05,556 --> 00:53:06,890
Donnie, right?

730
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,792
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

731
00:53:08,794 --> 00:53:10,659
Yeah, spotted you at the gym
the other day, yeah?

732
00:53:10,661 --> 00:53:12,263
Yeah, man. How you doing?

733
00:53:12,265 --> 00:53:13,834
What's up, fellows?

734
00:53:17,102 --> 00:53:18,570
You play football
at Long Beach Poly?

735
00:53:19,272 --> 00:53:20,407
You look familiar.

736
00:53:21,473 --> 00:53:23,077
No, I'm not from around here.

737
00:53:26,078 --> 00:53:28,314
What are you doing here?
You work around here?

738
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:32,415
Enjoying my dinner, man.

739
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:33,783
- Really?
- Yeah.

740
00:53:33,785 --> 00:53:34,787
Food here sucks.

741
00:53:36,356 --> 00:53:40,626
Yeah. Yeah,
we come here for the ass.

742
00:53:45,999 --> 00:53:47,501
So I'll see ya
at the gym, man.

743
00:53:52,104 --> 00:53:55,105
Yeah. Definitely.

744
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:56,477
Have a good night.

745
00:54:03,614 --> 00:54:07,151
Number 55, right?
That's how I remember you.

746
00:54:07,153 --> 00:54:09,289
We wore the same
number, 55, right?

747
00:54:10,022 --> 00:54:11,554
I went to South Torrance.

748
00:54:11,556 --> 00:54:14,457
Yeah, we played you guys
a couple of times.

749
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:17,127
You and all those
fat-ass Samoans.

750
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:20,530
Yeah, they were big,
but, man, lazy motherfuckers.

751
00:54:20,532 --> 00:54:21,969
Probably all that Spam.

752
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:25,902
Yeah, we fucking
crushed you guys.

753
00:54:25,904 --> 00:54:28,908
Crushed you guys when I was there.
Crushed you guys when you were there.

754
00:54:29,709 --> 00:54:31,178
Still crushing you guys.

755
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:35,812
We've got family here, bro.

756
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,480
Don't really appreciate
you popping off.

757
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:40,718
All right. All right, man.
No need to get all agro.

758
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,523
Was I being rude?
Was I being rude?

759
00:54:44,923 --> 00:54:47,024
- What?
- Let's go order, bro.

760
00:54:47,026 --> 00:54:48,859
Hey, look, man, listen.

761
00:54:48,861 --> 00:54:52,366
You've got a beautiful family.
Everything's all good. Excuse us.

762
00:54:55,734 --> 00:54:56,903
Kampai.

763
00:54:58,337 --> 00:54:59,740
See you at the gym, Donnie.

764
00:55:01,107 --> 00:55:02,508
Have a good night, ladies.

765
00:55:30,736 --> 00:55:31,805
You a cop?

766
00:55:33,572 --> 00:55:35,776
No. Are you?

767
00:55:44,583 --> 00:55:45,651
Get out of the car.

768
00:55:54,626 --> 00:55:55,628
Go!

769
00:56:15,646 --> 00:56:16,913
- Where's the wire?
- Come on, man.

770
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:18,650
I'm not wearing
a fucking wire, man.

771
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:22,752
Man, I'm not wearing
no fucking wire.

772
00:56:27,693 --> 00:56:28,829
Get up.

773
00:56:38,337 --> 00:56:40,437
How does he know you?

774
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:42,275
Don't tell me
it's from the fucking gym.

775
00:56:43,876 --> 00:56:45,843
Look, I don't know him.

776
00:56:45,845 --> 00:56:46,847
Smoke this punk.

777
00:56:50,883 --> 00:56:53,650
Talk, motherfucker.

778
00:56:53,652 --> 00:56:55,819
I'm not no cop, all right?

779
00:56:55,821 --> 00:56:57,721
Now he came to me.
He know you.

780
00:56:57,723 --> 00:57:00,690
He know all of you.
But I ain't tell him shit.

781
00:57:00,692 --> 00:57:02,292
He was sweating me.
I ain't seen him since.

782
00:57:02,294 --> 00:57:03,863
I thought he'd leave us alone.

783
00:57:12,037 --> 00:57:13,505
So how much do they know?

784
00:57:15,341 --> 00:57:16,343
Nothing.

785
00:57:17,576 --> 00:57:19,343
I ain't tell them shit.

786
00:57:19,345 --> 00:57:21,879
I don't know nothing anyway.

787
00:57:21,881 --> 00:57:24,718
And you know I'm the last
person that would fuck this up.

788
00:57:26,819 --> 00:57:28,889
Now, if we've got to
call it off, I get it.

789
00:57:30,022 --> 00:57:31,725
But I know
I ain't tell them shit.

790
00:57:55,348 --> 00:57:58,418
Friday. Make sure
he knows it's on.

791
00:58:25,912 --> 00:58:27,944
So good.

792
00:58:27,946 --> 00:58:30,783
It's true though. It's true.

793
00:58:31,417 --> 00:58:32,819
Okay.

794
00:58:33,386 --> 00:58:34,553
Okay.

795
00:58:44,397 --> 00:58:45,830
How you doing, Nick?

796
00:58:48,935 --> 00:58:50,968
- I'm Nick.
- Hello.

797
00:58:50,970 --> 00:58:53,140
- How are you?
- Good.

798
00:58:57,675 --> 00:58:59,276
What's for...

799
00:58:59,278 --> 00:59:01,779
- What's for dinner?
- You smell like alcohol, Nick.

800
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:07,753
Relax.

801
00:59:08,652 --> 00:59:10,622
I already ate.

802
00:59:17,330 --> 00:59:19,330
Give me a pen, stud.

803
00:59:19,332 --> 00:59:21,499
Nick, I was gonna call you.

804
00:59:21,501 --> 00:59:23,033
I was gonna take you
to dinner next week.

805
00:59:23,035 --> 00:59:25,038
Just give me a fucking pen.

806
00:59:43,055 --> 00:59:44,390
Thanks, Rudd.

807
00:59:46,657 --> 00:59:49,395
- I'm gonna hit the...
- No, you're not.

808
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:57,803
How's the wine?

809
01:00:00,339 --> 01:00:01,673
Good?

810
01:00:05,410 --> 01:00:07,545
That's pretty fucking good.

811
01:00:09,247 --> 01:00:11,047
So I imagine
I just...

812
01:00:11,049 --> 01:00:14,888
What, just sign
anywhere, yeah?

813
01:00:15,554 --> 01:00:17,187
Okay.

814
01:00:17,189 --> 01:00:20,758
And I imagine it's assumed
that if you were ever

815
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:24,693
to touch one of my girls
or, say, talk to them

816
01:00:24,695 --> 01:00:26,565
or, you know,
even look at them,

817
01:00:28,033 --> 01:00:31,234
I go boom-boom. You
know what I'm saying?

818
01:00:31,236 --> 01:00:32,736
But, I mean, that's
self-evident, right?

819
01:00:32,738 --> 01:00:35,572
There's no need to put that
in the contract, is there?

820
01:00:35,574 --> 01:00:36,895
- No, I didn't think so.
- Nick...

821
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:44,383
Can you please go, Nick?

822
01:00:45,417 --> 01:00:47,552
- That's enough, Nick.
- Sure.

823
01:00:52,556 --> 01:00:53,591
Come on.

824
01:00:55,127 --> 01:00:57,594
Come here. Give me a hug.

825
01:00:57,596 --> 01:01:00,100
Come on. We'll save
a fortune in therapy.

826
01:01:05,770 --> 01:01:06,906
Come on. Give me a hug.

827
01:01:09,075 --> 01:01:11,741
There you go, huh, hoss?

828
01:01:11,743 --> 01:01:14,644
You've just always got to make
a spectacle out of everything.

829
01:01:14,646 --> 01:01:16,446
There you go.

830
01:01:16,448 --> 01:01:17,917
Yeah, pretty much.

831
01:01:19,118 --> 01:01:21,653
All right, Nick.
I think it's time to go.

832
01:01:22,888 --> 01:01:24,156
Come on, Nick, let's go.

833
01:01:27,592 --> 01:01:29,792
Call the fucking cops.
That's what I'm saying.

834
01:01:29,794 --> 01:01:32,296
- Call the fucking cops.
- I'm sorry, but it's time for you to go.

835
01:01:32,298 --> 01:01:33,630
Call the cops.

836
01:01:33,632 --> 01:01:36,265
- I'm sorry...
- Don't fucking touch me.

837
01:01:36,267 --> 01:01:38,901
- I'm sorry.
- Do not fucking touch me.

838
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:40,940
- Come on, Nick.
- Just, please go.

839
01:01:55,153 --> 01:01:56,856
Take your time.

840
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:06,699
What happened to you?

841
01:02:14,839 --> 01:02:16,809
Borracho, what do you think?

842
01:02:17,877 --> 01:02:19,843
What the fuck was that?

843
01:02:19,845 --> 01:02:21,145
You spotted me at the gym?

844
01:02:21,147 --> 01:02:22,782
Tranquillo. All right?

845
01:02:25,183 --> 01:02:26,852
Sit down.

846
01:02:30,189 --> 01:02:32,189
I'll take it, Freddy.

847
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:34,461
Just give us a minute, okay?

848
01:02:37,695 --> 01:02:40,531
Look, they're not going to off
you with this much heat, okay?

849
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:43,668
When's this happening?

850
01:02:44,136 --> 01:02:45,372
Friday.

851
01:02:46,337 --> 01:02:48,138
Where?

852
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:50,343
I don't know yet.
All I can tell you is Friday.

853
01:02:51,042 --> 01:02:52,709
TGIF, huh?

854
01:02:52,711 --> 01:02:54,480
You're protecting me on this.

855
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,316
Fräulein,

856
01:02:58,049 --> 01:02:59,185
we got your back, bro.

857
01:03:00,352 --> 01:03:02,022
Don't worry about a thing.

858
01:03:04,556 --> 01:03:05,759
Fuck.

859
01:03:08,194 --> 01:03:10,029
Better wear your vest.

860
01:03:10,895 --> 01:03:12,198
We're in.

861
01:08:31,917 --> 01:08:34,718
Z?

862
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:37,420
Pico Rivera Savings,
Montebello Town Center.

863
01:08:37,422 --> 01:08:39,188
Copy that, boss.
See you at 0800.

864
01:08:39,190 --> 01:08:40,524
Tell the crew.

865
01:08:45,595 --> 01:08:47,698
I did what you told me to.

866
01:10:45,284 --> 01:10:46,786
There you go.
Good job there.

867
01:10:54,325 --> 01:10:55,559
McKenna!

868
01:11:03,202 --> 01:11:06,903
Hey, sweetie. Hey, sweetie.

869
01:11:06,905 --> 01:11:09,973
How are you? Good?

870
01:11:09,975 --> 01:11:11,144
What are you doing?

871
01:11:12,343 --> 01:11:15,010
Well, you know,
I was on my way to work

872
01:11:15,012 --> 01:11:18,715
and thought I'd come by and say
hello to my little monkey.

873
01:11:18,717 --> 01:11:20,583
Is that okay?

874
01:11:20,585 --> 01:11:22,751
How's everything
at school? Okay?

875
01:11:22,753 --> 01:11:24,588
- Yes, it's good.
- Yeah?

876
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:28,425
And what about Auntie's house?

877
01:11:28,427 --> 01:11:30,229
Mommy and Cassady,
are they good?

878
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:38,734
What about the honey-bear?
Honey-bear good?

879
01:11:38,736 --> 01:11:40,906
Yeah? You miss me?

880
01:11:45,944 --> 01:11:49,011
All right, Pookie,
better get back to class.

881
01:11:49,013 --> 01:11:51,014
When am I going
to see you again?

882
01:11:51,016 --> 01:11:54,686
Soon, sweetheart.
I'm gonna see you soon.

883
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,357
I want to come home.

884
01:12:01,226 --> 01:12:02,561
Me too.

885
01:12:04,096 --> 01:12:06,799
All right, you better
get back to class, okay?

886
01:12:07,865 --> 01:12:09,202
But I'm gonna see you later.

887
01:12:10,101 --> 01:12:11,236
Promise?

888
01:12:13,939 --> 01:12:15,574
I promise.

889
01:12:17,641 --> 01:12:19,477
Come on.

890
01:12:22,613 --> 01:12:26,118
Recess is over.
Come on, kids. Come line up.

891
01:12:27,319 --> 01:12:28,921
Go on, Pookie.

892
01:12:29,587 --> 01:12:30,987
Bye, Daddy.

893
01:12:30,989 --> 01:12:32,325
Come on, McKenna.

894
01:12:34,591 --> 01:12:36,127
Come on, honey.

895
01:13:51,203 --> 01:13:52,805
Jock up.

896
01:14:00,677 --> 01:14:02,181
Tac up, brother.

897
01:14:05,383 --> 01:14:07,416
No Fed?

898
01:14:07,418 --> 01:14:09,087
Change of plans.

899
01:14:10,756 --> 01:14:12,822
Pay attention.

900
01:14:12,824 --> 01:14:15,864
Always keep your finger off the trigger
until you're going to shoot somebody.

901
01:14:16,261 --> 01:14:19,561
If and when that happens,
safety selector switch.

902
01:14:19,563 --> 01:14:21,400
One for semi,
two for full auto.

903
01:14:40,684 --> 01:14:42,117
Mag release.

904
01:14:42,119 --> 01:14:44,219
Out with the old,
in with the new.

905
01:14:44,221 --> 01:14:46,456
Tug it. Make sure
it's in there good.

906
01:14:46,458 --> 01:14:49,058
Slap the bolt home,
you're ready for round two.

907
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:52,127
Other than that, keep this thing
pointed at the fucking floor.

908
01:14:52,129 --> 01:14:53,466
- You understand?
- Got it.

909
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:56,202
Go put your shit on.

910
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:20,292
- Magazine, Borracho?
- Yeah.

911
01:15:51,521 --> 01:15:53,658
- We good?
- We good.

912
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:31,894
Suspects arriving on location.

913
01:16:31,896 --> 01:16:34,162
We've got nothing for the DA. They
haven't committed a crime yet.

914
01:16:34,164 --> 01:16:36,299
They clear the bank,
we take them down.

915
01:16:36,301 --> 01:16:37,903
- Stand by.
- Roger that.

916
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:50,345
Broad fucking daylight.

917
01:16:50,347 --> 01:16:51,548
They're packing big.

918
01:16:53,885 --> 01:16:57,521
Ooh, shit. Look at these
motherfuckers.

919
01:17:02,726 --> 01:17:04,894
Get down on the ground!
Get down on the ground!

920
01:17:04,896 --> 01:17:07,362
Down on the ground! Get
down on the fucking ground!

921
01:17:07,364 --> 01:17:08,430
Freeze!

922
01:17:08,432 --> 01:17:10,032
Freeze! Don't move!
Stay right there!

923
01:17:10,034 --> 01:17:11,069
Freeze!

924
01:17:11,936 --> 01:17:13,269
Freeze!

925
01:17:13,271 --> 01:17:15,203
- You two! Move! Get over there!
- Get over here!

926
01:17:15,205 --> 01:17:17,075
Hurry up!

927
01:17:18,944 --> 01:17:20,777
Get out here, now!

928
01:17:20,779 --> 01:17:24,083
Move there now! Go! Go! Go!

929
01:17:25,249 --> 01:17:28,052
Move back!
Stay right there! Now!

930
01:17:29,287 --> 01:17:31,056
Eyes to the floor!

931
01:17:34,092 --> 01:17:35,724
Listen up!

932
01:17:35,726 --> 01:17:37,859
Everybody pay the fuck
attention!

933
01:17:37,861 --> 01:17:39,295
Eyes to the ground!

934
01:17:39,297 --> 01:17:41,530
'Cause I'm only
going to say this once!

935
01:17:41,532 --> 01:17:44,701
If you cooperate,
if you follow directions,

936
01:17:44,703 --> 01:17:48,770
you will not be hurt. We are
here for money, not for you.

937
01:17:48,772 --> 01:17:50,872
I want everybody lined up
on the counter. Let's go!

938
01:17:50,874 --> 01:17:52,144
Move down!

939
01:17:52,877 --> 01:17:54,410
Move down! Let's go!

940
01:17:54,412 --> 01:17:57,279
Everybody behind the counter,
come out front! Let's go!

941
01:17:57,281 --> 01:18:00,084
Keep your eyes down
and your mouths shut.

942
01:18:00,885 --> 01:18:02,986
On my command,

943
01:18:02,988 --> 01:18:07,090
reach inside your pockets,
remove your cell phones,

944
01:18:07,092 --> 01:18:09,826
and put your hands in the air.

945
01:18:09,828 --> 01:18:12,330
Everybody take
two steps forward.

946
01:18:14,065 --> 01:18:16,001
Now go down on your knees.

947
01:18:18,903 --> 01:18:20,838
All right! Cell phones
right in here.

948
01:18:21,239 --> 01:18:22,404
On me.

949
01:18:22,406 --> 01:18:23,638
Let's go.
Put them in the box.

950
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:24,842
Tie them up.

951
01:18:27,412 --> 01:18:29,478
Go! Go! Go!

952
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:31,647
There will be
no heroics today.

953
01:18:31,649 --> 01:18:34,183
You guys go ahead
and get comfortable.

954
01:18:34,185 --> 01:18:36,118
We're going to
be here for a while.

955
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:38,289
Anybody need to
use the bathroom?

956
01:18:39,457 --> 01:18:40,993
Take a piss on yourself.

957
01:18:49,467 --> 01:18:50,501
Hey.

958
01:18:57,007 --> 01:18:59,509
You. Get up.

959
01:19:00,845 --> 01:19:01,847
Stop.

960
01:19:06,116 --> 01:19:07,453
Sit down.

961
01:19:13,223 --> 01:19:14,522
All right, I need you
to calm down right now.

962
01:19:14,524 --> 01:19:16,995
Hey! Look at me.

963
01:19:18,363 --> 01:19:19,365
Take a deep breath.

964
01:19:22,533 --> 01:19:24,067
Good.

965
01:19:24,069 --> 01:19:26,702
I know you already triggered
the silent alarms.

966
01:19:26,704 --> 01:19:28,570
So I need you
to pick up the phone,

967
01:19:28,572 --> 01:19:32,540
dial 911 dispatch,
and explain the following.

968
01:19:32,542 --> 01:19:34,212
Go ahead and write this down.

969
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:40,483
There's a 211 in progress,
and we have hostages.

970
01:19:40,485 --> 01:19:43,251
Within one hour, they need
to deliver $10 million

971
01:19:43,253 --> 01:19:46,554
in unmarked small denomination
bills to this bank

972
01:19:46,556 --> 01:19:49,590
inside a department helicopter
loaded with fuel.

973
01:19:49,592 --> 01:19:54,162
Tell them we plan on killing one hostage
every hour until our demands are met.

974
01:19:54,164 --> 01:19:56,364
No cops are to
approach the bank.

975
01:19:56,366 --> 01:19:59,567
And if a negotiator
even tries to contact us,

976
01:19:59,569 --> 01:20:01,739
we will automatically kill
another hostage.

977
01:20:03,107 --> 01:20:05,576
Is that clear?
You got it all?

978
01:20:08,679 --> 01:20:10,182
Go ahead
and pick up the phone.

979
01:20:15,787 --> 01:20:18,187
Any available units,
we have a bank 211 in progress...

980
01:20:18,189 --> 01:20:19,521
Shit.

981
01:20:19,523 --> 01:20:20,688
at the Pico Rivera Savings
in Montebello

982
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:24,093
at 2891 Wilcox and Atlantic.

983
01:20:24,095 --> 01:20:25,693
- Suspects are armed...
- What the fuck?

984
01:20:25,695 --> 01:20:27,764
and have taken hostages
and are refusing a negotiator.

985
01:20:27,766 --> 01:20:30,233
What the fuck is going on?
That's not their MO.

986
01:20:30,235 --> 01:20:33,634
Call in, tell them we're on scene,
have suspects under surveillance,

987
01:20:33,636 --> 01:20:35,203
and to back the fuck off.

988
01:20:35,205 --> 01:20:38,474
This is LASD, we have surveillance
on the bank. Stand down.

989
01:20:38,476 --> 01:20:41,911
I repeat,
have all units stand down.

990
01:20:41,913 --> 01:20:43,813
It's bullshit. I can
hear them already.

991
01:20:45,083 --> 01:20:46,603
What the fuck are they doing?

992
01:20:52,056 --> 01:20:53,255
Stop!

993
01:20:53,257 --> 01:20:54,558
Get out!

994
01:21:06,436 --> 01:21:08,473
What the fuck
are you guys doing, huh?

995
01:21:10,074 --> 01:21:11,407
Asshole!

996
01:21:11,409 --> 01:21:13,276
What the fuck are you doing?
What's going on?

997
01:21:13,278 --> 01:21:15,243
You were running surveillance,
and you let this shit go down?

998
01:21:15,245 --> 01:21:18,313
It's our fucking case. We've been
surveilling these guys for weeks.

999
01:21:18,315 --> 01:21:19,647
That's what surveillance is!

1000
01:21:19,649 --> 01:21:22,318
They commit a crime,
and then we stop them.

1001
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:23,654
Go. Go to the vault.

1002
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:25,622
Open it.

1003
01:21:40,503 --> 01:21:41,973
Let's go. Come.

1004
01:21:45,310 --> 01:21:46,644
Sit. Sit down.

1005
01:21:54,118 --> 01:21:56,684
I'm going to put this
on speaker phone.

1006
01:21:56,686 --> 01:21:58,187
You're going to answer,
but don't use any names.

1007
01:21:58,189 --> 01:21:59,490
You understand?

1008
01:22:03,227 --> 01:22:04,492
Hello?

1009
01:22:04,494 --> 01:22:06,862
Hello, this is the Los Angeles
Police Department.

1010
01:22:06,864 --> 01:22:08,629
Who am I speaking with?

1011
01:22:08,631 --> 01:22:10,032
This is the branch manager.

1012
01:22:10,034 --> 01:22:12,033
Sir, I need to speak
with the person in charge.

1013
01:22:12,035 --> 01:22:13,969
You are.

1014
01:22:13,971 --> 01:22:17,172
Okay, good. Well, let me introduce myself.
I'm Officer Parada...

1015
01:22:17,174 --> 01:22:22,211
I don't give a fuck who you are.
Are our demands being met?

1016
01:22:22,213 --> 01:22:23,345
Who am I talking with now?

1017
01:22:23,347 --> 01:22:24,880
Answer the question.

1018
01:22:24,882 --> 01:22:26,580
It's being worked on
as we speak.

1019
01:22:26,582 --> 01:22:27,817
But you need to understand...

1020
01:22:27,819 --> 01:22:29,053
You just killed a hostage.

1021
01:22:30,387 --> 01:22:31,890
God damn it!

1022
01:22:38,561 --> 01:22:41,363
- Get up. Get up!
- No! No! No!

1023
01:22:41,365 --> 01:22:43,064
Come on, move!

1024
01:22:43,066 --> 01:22:45,434
I didn't do anything. Please.
What are you doing?

1025
01:22:45,436 --> 01:22:49,908
- Come on.
- No! No! No!

1026
01:22:54,244 --> 01:22:55,377
Fuck!

1027
01:22:55,379 --> 01:22:57,246
- You were on it, huh?
- Shit!

1028
01:22:57,248 --> 01:22:58,679
You're so full of shit,
O'Brien...

1029
01:22:58,681 --> 01:23:00,581
You heard the demands,
you stupid motherfucker!

1030
01:23:00,583 --> 01:23:03,752
- Yeah.
- You put a negotiator on? Christ!

1031
01:23:03,754 --> 01:23:05,254
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me?

1032
01:23:05,256 --> 01:23:06,421
Yeah, fuck you!

1033
01:23:06,423 --> 01:23:08,390
Fucking nice haircut,
you fucking idiot.

1034
01:23:08,392 --> 01:23:09,858
Who are you
fucking pushing now?

1035
01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:11,227
Are you fucking kidding?

1036
01:23:11,229 --> 01:23:13,362
- Get SWAT rolling right now!
- You fucking pussy.

1037
01:23:13,364 --> 01:23:15,096
Fucking Lobbin' Bob is angry!

1038
01:23:15,098 --> 01:23:17,433
- All right, boss, let's go. Let's go.
- Shitheads!

1039
01:23:17,435 --> 01:23:19,534
- Let's go.
- Fuck!

1040
01:23:19,536 --> 01:23:21,103
We've got a situation
going on...

1041
01:23:21,105 --> 01:23:22,140
Shit!

1042
01:23:24,275 --> 01:23:26,111
What the fuck are you
doing, Merrimen?

1043
01:23:37,288 --> 01:23:38,754
Yeah?

1044
01:23:38,756 --> 01:23:41,256
This is the Police Department.
Please don't hang up.

1045
01:23:41,258 --> 01:23:42,959
My name's Danny,

1046
01:23:42,961 --> 01:23:45,294
I'll be your only contact. Nobody
else is going to call you.

1047
01:23:45,296 --> 01:23:47,295
Is this the person in charge?

1048
01:23:47,297 --> 01:23:49,064
This is the branch manager.

1049
01:23:49,066 --> 01:23:52,634
I'm speaking on the
man in charge's behalf.

1050
01:23:52,636 --> 01:23:54,635
Do you have a name,
branch manager?

1051
01:23:56,306 --> 01:23:59,777
Listen. They've already killed
one of the hostages. A woman.

1052
01:24:00,979 --> 01:24:02,978
They will not
speak to you again.

1053
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:06,482
If you call back again before their
demands are met, they'll kill another.

1054
01:24:06,484 --> 01:24:08,483
Just send what they want.

1055
01:24:08,485 --> 01:24:10,452
The money and the chopper
are en route,

1056
01:24:10,454 --> 01:24:12,121
but it's going to take
a little bit of time.

1057
01:24:12,123 --> 01:24:15,360
You need to give me at least
90 minutes. Is this doable?

1058
01:24:17,627 --> 01:24:19,630
Okay. Don't call back.

1059
01:24:44,888 --> 01:24:46,154
What's the prefix here?

1060
01:24:46,156 --> 01:24:47,491
562. It's Long Beach.

1061
01:24:54,498 --> 01:24:56,197
Hello?

1062
01:24:56,199 --> 01:24:57,401
You watching?

1063
01:25:02,039 --> 01:25:03,040
Yup.

1064
01:25:08,212 --> 01:25:10,293
So how the hell are you going
to get out of this one?

1065
01:25:11,848 --> 01:25:13,351
Not sure yet.

1066
01:25:17,488 --> 01:25:19,690
Did you get my number
from her cell?

1067
01:25:26,497 --> 01:25:28,100
I ain't cuffing up.

1068
01:25:30,699 --> 01:25:32,337
That's okay.

1069
01:25:33,738 --> 01:25:36,274
I didn't bring
my cuffs anyway.

1070
01:25:38,008 --> 01:25:39,744
Yeah, I can see that.

1071
01:26:00,097 --> 01:26:01,631
Was that who I think it was?

1072
01:26:02,299 --> 01:26:03,467
Yup.

1073
01:26:10,606 --> 01:26:12,140
We've got a chopper
that's gonna come down.

1074
01:26:12,142 --> 01:26:13,903
The chopper is going to land
right over here.

1075
01:26:21,918 --> 01:26:26,157
I've got two-door entry on one.
One-door entry on two.

1076
01:26:27,792 --> 01:26:28,794
Breaching!

1077
01:26:35,833 --> 01:26:37,469
Well, they just
blew the vault.

1078
01:26:38,136 --> 01:26:39,503
What the fuck?

1079
01:26:49,946 --> 01:26:51,313
Federal Reserve,
accounts receiving.

1080
01:26:51,315 --> 01:26:53,148
Hey, it's Al at Alameda.

1081
01:26:53,150 --> 01:26:55,818
We have a drop at Pico Rivera
we need to schedule.

1082
01:26:55,820 --> 01:26:57,786
How's Wednesday at 2:00?

1083
01:26:57,788 --> 01:27:00,156
That works. You're confirmed
for 2:00 p.m. the 18th.

1084
01:27:00,158 --> 01:27:02,358
Great. Thanks.

1085
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:03,929
- We're here, yeah?
- Yeah, that's us.

1086
01:27:05,163 --> 01:27:06,530
So what is this?

1087
01:27:07,498 --> 01:27:09,031
This is the sewer line,

1088
01:27:09,033 --> 01:27:11,803
and according to this map right
here, it's all cemented up.

1089
01:27:32,022 --> 01:27:33,382
Hey, where are we
with the chopper?

1090
01:27:34,191 --> 01:27:36,358
We're waiting on clearance.

1091
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:38,359
Relax, they're not
going anywhere.

1092
01:27:38,361 --> 01:27:41,696
To hell with clearance.
We've got to move.

1093
01:27:41,698 --> 01:27:43,135
O'Brien, hey!

1094
01:27:44,533 --> 01:27:47,202
Is he off his meds?

1095
01:27:47,204 --> 01:27:49,205
Tell him to get
the fuck back here!

1096
01:27:49,207 --> 01:27:50,706
Will you shut the fuck up?

1097
01:27:50,708 --> 01:27:51,877
Oh, fuck you.

1098
01:28:02,052 --> 01:28:04,585
We better go back him up.

1099
01:28:04,587 --> 01:28:06,154
Nick's heading to the front.
We're on the move.

1100
01:28:06,156 --> 01:28:07,159
Here we go.

1101
01:28:12,829 --> 01:28:14,832
- Fuck!
- Is he serious?

1102
01:28:38,088 --> 01:28:39,420
Everybody okay?

1103
01:28:39,422 --> 01:28:40,758
Yes.

1104
01:28:46,595 --> 01:28:51,133
Please, Lord, please,
let me see my family again.

1105
01:29:06,284 --> 01:29:07,484
- Nick!
- Sheriff's Department.

1106
01:29:08,785 --> 01:29:09,952
Nick!

1107
01:29:09,954 --> 01:29:10,989
Clear!

1108
01:29:14,257 --> 01:29:15,625
Clear!

1109
01:29:23,266 --> 01:29:25,470
- The fuck?
- Nick, what's your location?

1110
01:29:29,339 --> 01:29:30,640
What's your location?

1111
01:29:39,150 --> 01:29:41,317
Hey, this is Al
at Alameda again.

1112
01:29:41,319 --> 01:29:43,852
I forgot to schedule a drop
at the Pico Rivera Savings.

1113
01:29:43,854 --> 01:29:45,490
What do you have open today?

1114
01:29:53,030 --> 01:29:55,530
Ghetto Bird, this is Silverback.
We confirmed?

1115
01:29:55,532 --> 01:29:59,003
Check. Appointment's at 2:45.
That's in two minutes.

1116
01:30:12,882 --> 01:30:14,151
Pico Rivera.

1117
01:30:22,827 --> 01:30:24,692
Horsepower all set?

1118
01:30:24,694 --> 01:30:26,197
Yeah, I'm ready to go.

1119
01:30:40,510 --> 01:30:42,044
They got you
on a new route?

1120
01:30:42,046 --> 01:30:44,912
Yeah. Yeah, they just
switched us over this week.

1121
01:30:44,914 --> 01:30:48,648
All right. Let me
get you guys' IDs, man.

1122
01:30:48,650 --> 01:30:51,388
Yeah, sure. There you go.

1123
01:30:58,995 --> 01:31:00,397
All right.

1124
01:31:01,231 --> 01:31:02,730
You're good to go.

1125
01:31:02,732 --> 01:31:04,972
- All right, thank you.
- Open the gate. Have a good one.

1126
01:31:46,409 --> 01:31:47,412
Oh, fuck.

1127
01:31:57,587 --> 01:31:59,955
Pico Rivera Savings? 2.2?

1128
01:31:59,957 --> 01:32:01,456
Yup, that's us.

1129
01:32:01,458 --> 01:32:02,825
Bring her up.

1130
01:32:02,827 --> 01:32:04,796
All right, ready.
One, two, three.

1131
01:32:12,101 --> 01:32:14,104
- Sign here.
- You got it.

1132
01:32:15,439 --> 01:32:16,775
You're new here, Mark?

1133
01:32:17,807 --> 01:32:19,010
Yes, sir.

1134
01:32:21,244 --> 01:32:22,677
You guys running
a little bit late.

1135
01:32:22,679 --> 01:32:25,784
Yeah, we ran into
some traffic, so...

1136
01:32:27,485 --> 01:32:29,117
I don't know where they had
you guys routed before,

1137
01:32:29,119 --> 01:32:31,420
but we run a tight, tight ship
around here,

1138
01:32:31,422 --> 01:32:33,822
so, if you're going to be
late, have base call it in.

1139
01:32:33,824 --> 01:32:35,290
Yeah, no problem.
That's my fault. I just...

1140
01:32:35,292 --> 01:32:37,661
Just have them call.

1141
01:32:38,661 --> 01:32:39,798
On me.

1142
01:33:18,667 --> 01:33:21,370
Hey, Luigi. Alameda's on deck.
Check them in.

1143
01:33:21,372 --> 01:33:22,538
Copy that.

1144
01:33:23,039 --> 01:33:24,341
New guys.

1145
01:33:25,507 --> 01:33:27,177
I'm going to
step out for a minute.

1146
01:33:54,570 --> 01:33:55,903
How you guys doing today?

1147
01:33:55,905 --> 01:33:57,708
- Good. All right.
- Good.

1148
01:34:03,613 --> 01:34:04,779
How you doing?

1149
01:34:04,781 --> 01:34:07,416
- All right, how are you?
- Good, thank you.

1150
01:34:07,418 --> 01:34:08,953
Sign that for me, please.

1151
01:34:11,587 --> 01:34:13,588
All hundreds?

1152
01:34:13,590 --> 01:34:16,394
The first one's all hundreds.
The second one is mixed.

1153
01:34:17,394 --> 01:34:18,859
We're a little backed up.

1154
01:34:18,861 --> 01:34:20,429
All right, do what you can.

1155
01:34:20,431 --> 01:34:22,696
Guys want to hang out, get a Coke
or something? Appreciate you.

1156
01:34:22,698 --> 01:34:23,699
Thank you.

1157
01:34:34,244 --> 01:34:36,576
We're going to need access
to the recording off-site.

1158
01:34:36,578 --> 01:34:38,279
Can you get that to us?

1159
01:34:38,281 --> 01:34:40,251
- Understood.
- You need professional help.

1160
01:34:40,985 --> 01:34:42,117
Desperately.

1161
01:34:42,119 --> 01:34:44,789
My bad last time.
Your crime scene.

1162
01:35:11,949 --> 01:35:14,983
Silverback, this
is Horsepower. I'm in.

1163
01:35:14,985 --> 01:35:18,521
Greenpeace, this is Silverback.
Horsepower is in.

1164
01:35:20,289 --> 01:35:22,658
Roger that, Silverback.
Lights out.

1165
01:35:30,833 --> 01:35:32,369
Okay, here we go.

1166
01:35:35,471 --> 01:35:37,839
Johnny, we're fucking brown
again, man.

1167
01:35:37,841 --> 01:35:39,944
Got to shut down. Pull them
out of the count rooms.

1168
01:35:41,044 --> 01:35:43,510
We're going brown.

1169
01:35:43,512 --> 01:35:46,073
We've got to shut down for a bit.
All teams go ahead and take 10.

1170
01:35:56,126 --> 01:35:57,192
Luigi, come on.

1171
01:35:57,194 --> 01:35:59,563
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1172
01:36:12,342 --> 01:36:14,212
They went to brown.
They're clearing out.

1173
01:36:16,413 --> 01:36:18,214
- Let's lock it down.
- Copy.

1174
01:36:23,685 --> 01:36:25,022
Get ready to go.

1175
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:39,201
Powering up EMP now.

1176
01:36:45,507 --> 01:36:46,742
All clear here.

1177
01:36:46,744 --> 01:36:47,745
Good to go.

1178
01:36:50,881 --> 01:36:52,115
You're clear. Go.

1179
01:37:00,190 --> 01:37:01,857
Shit. Check something out.

1180
01:37:01,859 --> 01:37:03,425
What do you think it is?

1181
01:37:03,427 --> 01:37:05,096
Are the cameras up
in the 100 room?

1182
01:37:05,863 --> 01:37:07,596
Uh, negative.

1183
01:37:13,137 --> 01:37:15,303
555-0143.

1184
01:37:15,305 --> 01:37:16,441
It's taking too long.

1185
01:37:17,473 --> 01:37:18,773
Tasty Orders.

1186
01:37:18,775 --> 01:37:20,108
This is Sharon at the Fed.

1187
01:37:20,110 --> 01:37:22,376
Now, we ordered almost
an hour and a half ago.

1188
01:37:22,378 --> 01:37:24,246
Now, I only have so much time
on my lunch break.

1189
01:37:24,248 --> 01:37:26,447
It coming!
Be there in a few minute!

1190
01:37:26,449 --> 01:37:28,049
They just called
for the Chinese.

1191
01:37:28,051 --> 01:37:29,153
Hurry it up.

1192
01:37:32,587 --> 01:37:34,322
Motion is out in there too.

1193
01:37:34,324 --> 01:37:35,625
Yeah, man, we're still brown.

1194
01:37:37,727 --> 01:37:40,295
You know, we better override.
Power it up.

1195
01:37:40,297 --> 01:37:41,299
All right.

1196
01:37:43,666 --> 01:37:44,765
Done.

1197
01:37:44,767 --> 01:37:46,337
Okay. Better get
that count too.

1198
01:37:58,248 --> 01:38:00,816
Shit, here comes security.
Get down. Get down.

1199
01:38:00,818 --> 01:38:03,488
Hey, man, we got to check this 100 count.
Motion went off.

1200
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:12,660
Luigi...

1201
01:38:12,662 --> 01:38:14,165
Step on it.
Step on it, quick.

1202
01:38:16,466 --> 01:38:17,598
Yeah?

1203
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,033
- Luigi.
- Yeah?

1204
01:38:19,035 --> 01:38:22,304
Damn, dude! Luigi, you're
stepping on the line, man!

1205
01:38:22,306 --> 01:38:23,971
Say again? Russell?

1206
01:38:23,973 --> 01:38:26,643
Hey, dumb-dumb. You've got to
let go of the push to talk.

1207
01:38:29,511 --> 01:38:31,314
What the hell is
going on here today?

1208
01:38:34,818 --> 01:38:36,184
Luigi, man. He's stepping
all over the line.

1209
01:38:36,186 --> 01:38:37,684
He's hot-micing
like a motherfucker.

1210
01:38:37,686 --> 01:38:40,221
He's in the cafeteria.
Go ahead and get him.

1211
01:38:40,223 --> 01:38:42,193
All right. Roger that.
I'm stepping out.

1212
01:38:50,900 --> 01:38:52,135
You're clear. Go.

1213
01:39:00,377 --> 01:39:01,379
Holy shit.

1214
01:39:38,949 --> 01:39:40,749
Luigi, you're hot-micing.

1215
01:39:40,751 --> 01:39:42,683
You've got to let go of the talk button.
You're stepping on the line.

1216
01:39:42,685 --> 01:39:44,684
Dude, it's not me.

1217
01:39:44,686 --> 01:39:47,255
Come on, we've got to check the 100 count.
Let's go. Get Junior. Let's go.

1218
01:39:47,257 --> 01:39:48,924
Switch to line five.

1219
01:39:48,926 --> 01:39:51,167
You got about a minute and a
half, two minutes. Let's go.

1220
01:40:19,622 --> 01:40:20,725
They're back. Get out.

1221
01:41:00,196 --> 01:41:02,263
Luigi, you see anything, man?

1222
01:41:02,265 --> 01:41:04,198
Yeah, we're good. There's
nothing back there but dust.

1223
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:06,134
What am I looking for?

1224
01:41:06,136 --> 01:41:07,769
Don't worry about it, man. I'm gonna
juice up the room. Run the count,

1225
01:41:07,771 --> 01:41:09,771
- and make sure we're good, all right?
- Copy that.

1226
01:41:10,639 --> 01:41:12,840
Where are you?

1227
01:41:12,842 --> 01:41:14,711
This is Horsepower.
I'm in the vents.

1228
01:41:21,784 --> 01:41:23,486
Greenpeace, you're done.
Cut out.

1229
01:41:26,957 --> 01:41:29,555
We are back up, brother.

1230
01:41:29,557 --> 01:41:31,729
All teams,
back to the count room.

1231
01:41:34,196 --> 01:41:35,830
Get on with LAPD Central.

1232
01:41:35,832 --> 01:41:38,966
Tell them we're running
surveillance at 8th and Grand.

1233
01:41:38,968 --> 01:41:42,036
Request a Code 5. We do not
wanna spook the suspects.

1234
01:41:42,038 --> 01:41:44,039
Copy that.
Putting in a Code 5.

1235
01:41:46,208 --> 01:41:49,010
Am I tripping or
was this full before?

1236
01:41:49,012 --> 01:41:50,381
Let's just check the count.

1237
01:42:20,342 --> 01:42:21,412
$712,200.

1238
01:42:23,446 --> 01:42:24,882
$712,200.

1239
01:42:25,915 --> 01:42:28,185
Russell, the count is on.

1240
01:42:29,753 --> 01:42:32,019
All right, roger that. Go
ahead and clock out Alameda.

1241
01:42:32,021 --> 01:42:33,423
Take Alameda out.

1242
01:42:55,610 --> 01:42:57,411
The count was good.

1243
01:42:57,413 --> 01:42:59,580
But both of your bins
were half-full.

1244
01:42:59,582 --> 01:43:01,249
Sorry?

1245
01:43:01,251 --> 01:43:03,119
Your bins,
they were half-full.

1246
01:43:04,488 --> 01:43:05,920
That's how we got them.

1247
01:43:05,922 --> 01:43:09,724
Next time, just put it
in a cash sack.

1248
01:43:09,726 --> 01:43:11,425
Makes things a lot easier.

1249
01:43:11,427 --> 01:43:13,728
Try and work smart, not hard.

1250
01:43:13,730 --> 01:43:15,330
Okay, sounds good.
Thanks for the advice.

1251
01:45:03,272 --> 01:45:07,075
We would tip you, honey, but that
just took too damn long, okay?

1252
01:45:07,077 --> 01:45:09,317
I'm the only guy they've got
delivering today. I'm sorry.

1253
01:45:35,604 --> 01:45:37,975
Sorry, guys, let me see
your drop confirmation again.

1254
01:45:39,876 --> 01:45:41,145
- All right.
- There you go.

1255
01:45:57,559 --> 01:45:59,129
Chinese food guy?

1256
01:45:59,829 --> 01:46:01,398
Go on. Buzz him in.

1257
01:46:06,802 --> 01:46:07,937
Hold him there.

1258
01:46:11,141 --> 01:46:12,276
2-4-5.

1259
01:46:19,114 --> 01:46:20,450
Yeah, send him through.

1260
01:46:23,253 --> 01:46:25,756
Come here for a sec, buddy.

1261
01:46:28,490 --> 01:46:30,327
Yeah, man, I don't
have you signed in.

1262
01:46:34,263 --> 01:46:36,096
Where's your name?

1263
01:46:36,098 --> 01:46:39,166
Come on, man, I signed my name with
a dude from the last shift, man.

1264
01:46:39,168 --> 01:46:40,436
I don't know what to tell you.

1265
01:46:45,307 --> 01:46:47,011
Damn you finicky.

1266
01:46:48,144 --> 01:46:49,608
- I'm getting my money back.
- Okay.

1267
01:46:49,610 --> 01:46:51,678
- I'm getting my money back.
- Okay.

1268
01:46:51,680 --> 01:46:52,682
That's all I need.

1269
01:46:58,053 --> 01:47:00,020
All right, you boys
are good to go.

1270
01:47:00,022 --> 01:47:01,554
- Thank you very much, Officer.
- Take it easy.

1271
01:47:01,556 --> 01:47:03,060
- You have a good day.
- All right.

1272
01:47:09,732 --> 01:47:12,035
- Go on. Get out of here.
- Thank you.

1273
01:47:15,671 --> 01:47:17,473
Yes, security in
the lobby, please.

1274
01:47:26,749 --> 01:47:27,881
Lobby.

1275
01:47:27,883 --> 01:47:29,884
Yeah, did you see
a delivery guy?

1276
01:47:29,886 --> 01:47:32,256
Red shirt, light skin.
About 6 foot.

1277
01:47:33,689 --> 01:47:35,759
- Wait, what?
- Stop him.

1278
01:47:40,163 --> 01:47:43,067
You got eyes on the 1-2 side?
We'll cover the 3-4 corner.

1279
01:47:44,066 --> 01:47:45,534
Copy that.

1280
01:47:57,881 --> 01:48:00,081
Got held up at security.
What's your location?

1281
01:48:00,083 --> 01:48:02,950
South on Grand,
just past Vernon.

1282
01:48:02,952 --> 01:48:05,585
Go right on Gage.
Right on Gage.

1283
01:48:05,587 --> 01:48:06,622
Copy that.

1284
01:48:27,877 --> 01:48:29,777
Move! Let's go! Get out!

1285
01:48:29,779 --> 01:48:32,246
- Come on, move! Move! Here we go!
- It's cool.

1286
01:48:32,248 --> 01:48:34,460
- Come on, get down! Go! Go! Go!
- It's cool. I'm cool, man.

1287
01:48:34,484 --> 01:48:35,819
Be cool, bro. Cool.

1288
01:48:37,552 --> 01:48:38,955
Fuck.

1289
01:48:58,341 --> 01:49:00,107
There he is. There he is.
Red shirt. Two blocks ahead.

1290
01:49:00,109 --> 01:49:01,908
Eyes on suspect.

1291
01:49:01,910 --> 01:49:06,013
Walking eastbound on 9th, approaching
Hill, south side of street.

1292
01:49:06,015 --> 01:49:08,448
Pull up in front of him,
in front of him.

1293
01:49:08,450 --> 01:49:10,084
Let's get this motherfucker.

1294
01:49:10,086 --> 01:49:11,806
Let's ram his bitch-ass
into the gate first.

1295
01:49:14,490 --> 01:49:16,959
Get in the fucking car!
Come on. Get in.

1296
01:49:18,761 --> 01:49:20,030
Fuck.

1297
01:49:20,497 --> 01:49:21,596
Hit him!

1298
01:49:30,538 --> 01:49:32,608
Motherfucker.

1299
01:49:49,292 --> 01:49:51,972
All right, let's go. Let's go. Let's
get it done as quick as we can.

1300
01:49:56,833 --> 01:49:58,799
Little fuck.

1301
01:49:58,801 --> 01:50:01,238
Where is he?
Where the fuck is he, asshole?

1302
01:50:02,204 --> 01:50:03,207
Fuck.

1303
01:50:05,874 --> 01:50:07,743
Fucking... Fucker!

1304
01:50:09,677 --> 01:50:12,547
Give me the burner phone.
Where the fuck is he?

1305
01:50:16,819 --> 01:50:18,986
Pacific Horizon Salvage.

1306
01:50:18,988 --> 01:50:21,524
In South Gate.
That's the rally point.

1307
01:50:30,833 --> 01:50:32,699
Silverback, go.

1308
01:50:32,702 --> 01:50:34,238
Horsepower's burned.

1309
01:50:36,204 --> 01:50:37,705
Repeat that. I can't hear you.

1310
01:50:37,707 --> 01:50:39,907
Horsepower is burned.

1311
01:50:39,909 --> 01:50:41,544
He's done.

1312
01:50:42,912 --> 01:50:44,714
I'm still clean.
Where am I going, bro?

1313
01:51:04,299 --> 01:51:06,200
Fuck!

1314
01:51:06,202 --> 01:51:08,135
Let's go. Let's go.
You guys got it all?

1315
01:51:08,137 --> 01:51:09,769
- Yes, it's all in.
- Pick it up.

1316
01:51:09,771 --> 01:51:10,774
It's good.

1317
01:51:12,874 --> 01:51:16,810
Pacific Horizon Salvage.
South Gate, Alameda Corridor.

1318
01:51:16,812 --> 01:51:18,382
10-4. Headed to you.

1319
01:51:25,221 --> 01:51:26,701
What happened
to the other two?

1320
01:51:30,658 --> 01:51:32,296
They got burned.

1321
01:51:57,954 --> 01:51:59,319
Eyes on suspects.

1322
01:51:59,321 --> 01:52:01,024
Black, four-door Suburban!

1323
01:52:06,796 --> 01:52:08,663
Heading southbound on Alameda.

1324
01:52:11,199 --> 01:52:15,438
Approaching Slauson Avenue. I need
you to parallel me on Santa Fe.

1325
01:52:25,047 --> 01:52:26,882
We got some traffic up ahead.
What's going on?

1326
01:52:28,150 --> 01:52:29,452
Corridor's backed up.

1327
01:52:36,359 --> 01:52:39,160
We just turned down Alameda Corridor,
heading south.

1328
01:52:48,471 --> 01:52:49,572
Shit.

1329
01:52:58,646 --> 01:53:00,647
Coming up on suspect,
six o'clock.

1330
01:53:00,649 --> 01:53:02,049
Shit.

1331
01:53:02,051 --> 01:53:04,218
Right lane is closed up ahead.

1332
01:53:04,220 --> 01:53:07,356
I repeat, right lane is
closed up ahead.

1333
01:53:12,195 --> 01:53:14,495
You guys see that?

1334
01:53:14,497 --> 01:53:16,565
Twenty, 30 cars back.
What is that?

1335
01:53:20,569 --> 01:53:21,838
Is that...

1336
01:53:26,708 --> 01:53:28,744
Okay, we're at
a stop, stop, stop.

1337
01:53:30,913 --> 01:53:32,581
Fuck backup.
We've got to move now.

1338
01:53:33,449 --> 01:53:34,751
Fuck.

1339
01:53:42,124 --> 01:53:43,225
Yup.

1340
01:53:49,265 --> 01:53:50,597
That's them.

1341
01:53:56,305 --> 01:53:58,537
- Give me my vest.
- Yeah.

1342
01:53:58,539 --> 01:54:00,110
Yeah, here we go.

1343
01:54:03,780 --> 01:54:06,279
Okay, we've got them pinched in. We've
got to move before it opens up.

1344
01:54:06,281 --> 01:54:07,615
Cuff him up.

1345
01:54:17,559 --> 01:54:20,126
Be advised, suspects wearing
body armor.

1346
01:54:20,128 --> 01:54:22,929
No center mass shots.
Limb and head shots only.

1347
01:54:22,931 --> 01:54:24,171
Copy that.
Go around right here.

1348
01:54:28,905 --> 01:54:30,407
It's jammed up.

1349
01:54:37,511 --> 01:54:39,514
Good? Okay, let's go.

1350
01:54:50,426 --> 01:54:52,326
- Oh, shit.
- What?

1351
01:54:52,328 --> 01:54:53,528
They're getting
out of the car.

1352
01:54:59,368 --> 01:55:01,001
Z, go down the right.

1353
01:55:01,003 --> 01:55:04,004
Gus, Borracho, center with me.

1354
01:55:04,006 --> 01:55:06,609
Murph, stay on the left.
Don't come in.

1355
01:55:07,509 --> 01:55:09,111
- Pass me the saw.
- Fuck.

1356
01:55:11,512 --> 01:55:13,115
Let's go.

1357
01:55:14,016 --> 01:55:15,185
Stay down. Stay down.

1358
01:55:42,577 --> 01:55:43,914
Get down. Get down.

1359
01:55:48,183 --> 01:55:50,383
- Sheriff's Department. Stay down.
- Get down. Get down.

1360
01:55:57,760 --> 01:55:59,995
- Get down.
- Sheriff's Department, stay down.

1361
01:56:03,164 --> 01:56:05,334
Get down. Get down.
Stay by the engine block.

1362
01:56:08,670 --> 01:56:10,207
Get down behind the wheel.

1363
01:56:17,747 --> 01:56:19,427
Sheriff's Department.
Lady, get in the car.

1364
01:56:25,288 --> 01:56:26,388
Oh, shit.

1365
01:56:29,091 --> 01:56:30,360
Borracho!

1366
01:56:36,766 --> 01:56:37,801
Moving!

1367
01:56:40,436 --> 01:56:41,438
Moving.

1368
01:57:00,455 --> 01:57:04,291
Gus, Murph, you two go across
and cut them off, okay?

1369
01:57:04,293 --> 01:57:06,730
Tony Z, you ready?

1370
01:57:07,463 --> 01:57:08,798
Let's go.

1371
01:57:31,586 --> 01:57:32,621
Moving!

1372
01:57:37,493 --> 01:57:38,495
Move!

1373
01:57:43,698 --> 01:57:45,936
Moving. Moving.

1374
01:57:51,007 --> 01:57:52,375
Mag change!

1375
01:57:58,980 --> 01:57:59,982
Moving.

1376
01:58:04,986 --> 01:58:06,056
Mag change.

1377
01:58:18,400 --> 01:58:19,401
Moving!

1378
01:58:24,639 --> 01:58:25,874
Go! Go! Peel off!

1379
01:58:36,217 --> 01:58:37,350
Tony, you okay?

1380
01:58:37,352 --> 01:58:39,055
- Yeah, go! Go!
- You okay?

1381
01:58:40,021 --> 01:58:41,024
Fuck!

1382
01:58:46,061 --> 01:58:47,062
Go!

1383
01:58:55,037 --> 01:58:56,039
Cover!

1384
01:59:01,110 --> 01:59:02,112
Move.

1385
01:59:12,221 --> 01:59:13,390
Fuck!

1386
01:59:30,205 --> 01:59:31,637
Brick wall! Brick wall!

1387
01:59:31,639 --> 01:59:33,109
Behind the brick building!

1388
02:01:20,882 --> 02:01:22,316
My kids...

1389
02:01:23,819 --> 02:01:25,321
You're in His hands now.

1390
02:01:26,422 --> 02:01:27,723
You hear me?

1391
02:02:17,306 --> 02:02:18,308
Fuck!

1392
02:04:00,541 --> 02:04:01,744
Don't do it.

1393
02:04:28,771 --> 02:04:30,403
Told you.

1394
02:04:45,586 --> 02:04:47,521
Yeah. You did.

1395
02:05:50,785 --> 02:05:52,187
What the fuck?

1396
02:06:03,498 --> 02:06:04,698
You see this?

1397
02:06:05,833 --> 02:06:07,169
Here. Do those.

1398
02:06:12,341 --> 02:06:13,342
Oh, shit.

1399
02:06:20,015 --> 02:06:23,352
So what? They were going to
make fucking snow globes?

1400
02:06:24,519 --> 02:06:26,355
Like 10,000 of them?

1401
02:06:35,563 --> 02:06:37,464
You check on the boys?

1402
02:06:37,466 --> 02:06:39,534
Yeah, I'm going
to roll to the hospital.

1403
02:06:44,205 --> 02:06:46,476
You gonna call
Borracho's wife?

1404
02:06:55,150 --> 02:06:56,252
Yeah.

1405
02:06:59,421 --> 02:07:00,890
All right.

1406
02:07:03,025 --> 02:07:04,559
This won't go to Harbor.

1407
02:07:23,511 --> 02:07:25,281
I'm sorry you lost
one of your guys.

1408
02:07:27,248 --> 02:07:28,447
Thanks.

1409
02:07:28,449 --> 02:07:29,916
You all right?

1410
02:07:29,918 --> 02:07:31,354
Yeah, I'm okay.

1411
02:07:32,753 --> 02:07:34,120
Yeah.

1412
02:07:34,122 --> 02:07:37,293
Nick, you've got to stop
smoking, man.

1413
02:07:38,092 --> 02:07:39,095
Here.

1414
02:07:40,928 --> 02:07:42,297
It's organic.

1415
02:07:50,771 --> 02:07:53,408
You know everything was accounted
for at the Fed, right?

1416
02:07:55,811 --> 02:07:57,146
Apparently so.

1417
02:09:27,735 --> 02:09:29,204
Hey, is Donnie around?

1418
02:09:31,138 --> 02:09:32,208
He quit.

1419
02:09:34,709 --> 02:09:36,311
So you haven't
seen him anywhere?

1420
02:09:37,645 --> 02:09:39,215
I said he quit.

1421
02:09:40,047 --> 02:09:41,249
Two days ago.

1422
02:09:56,897 --> 02:09:58,234
You want a beer?

1423
02:09:58,999 --> 02:10:01,901
Very much so. Like 50.

1424
02:10:08,243 --> 02:10:09,945
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1425
02:10:24,692 --> 02:10:27,359
Did you see that new chick?
Little fat-ass?

1426
02:10:27,361 --> 02:10:30,132
The new girl who
works down the hall?

1427
02:10:31,266 --> 02:10:33,699
What's going on, gentlemen?

1428
02:10:33,702 --> 02:10:35,702
- Gentlemen, good to see you.
- Yo!

1429
02:10:35,704 --> 02:10:39,875
- Good to see you.
- Your wife know where you are?

1430
02:10:55,289 --> 02:10:56,655
How did you get that job?

1431
02:10:56,657 --> 02:10:57,959
Can you actually count?

1432
02:10:59,627 --> 02:11:01,795
I'm in complete
control of my environment.

1433
02:11:01,797 --> 02:11:02,897
People don't even know.

1434
02:11:31,860 --> 02:11:33,595
Fucking Fräulein.

1435
02:11:43,171 --> 02:11:45,205
What's going on, boys?

1436
02:11:45,207 --> 02:11:46,541
How you doing? You good?

1437
02:11:47,507 --> 02:11:48,675
Some beers?

1438
02:11:49,177 --> 02:11:50,710
Hey, guv.

1439
02:11:50,712 --> 02:11:52,314
A round of beers for my mates.

1440
02:11:53,280 --> 02:11:55,014
And for you?

1441
02:11:55,016 --> 02:11:56,018
I'm easy.

1442
02:12:01,021 --> 02:12:02,190
I don't know.

1443
02:12:02,723 --> 02:12:03,726
Surprise me.

1444
02:12:06,861 --> 02:12:08,297
I can do that.

1445
02:12:09,529 --> 02:12:11,199
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1446
02:12:12,199 --> 02:12:13,733
So why you come to me?

1447
02:12:13,735 --> 02:12:15,401
You're a beast, man.

1448
02:12:15,403 --> 02:12:16,969
Plus, you're the only one
that can pull this off.

1449
02:12:16,971 --> 02:12:18,904
Listen.

1450
02:12:18,906 --> 02:12:20,874
We do this, I call the shots.

1451
02:12:20,876 --> 02:12:22,577
My crew, my job, not yours.

1452
02:12:23,577 --> 02:12:25,377
Got it?

1453
02:12:25,379 --> 02:12:27,539
- Completely understand.
- That's the way it has to be.

1454
02:12:28,717 --> 02:12:30,049
That's it.

1455
02:12:30,051 --> 02:12:31,650
It's my baby.

1456
02:12:31,652 --> 02:12:32,887
That's what I've got.

1457
02:12:34,555 --> 02:12:36,389
How did you get
a hold of all this stuff?

1458
02:12:36,391 --> 02:12:38,758
You got this all at that bar?

1459
02:12:38,760 --> 02:12:40,262
Collected it over time.

1460
02:12:53,673 --> 02:12:54,776
Job for Superman.

1461
02:13:08,123 --> 02:13:10,223
Cheers.

1462
02:13:10,225 --> 02:13:12,425
Thank you. I love when
you call me Princess.

1463
02:13:13,762 --> 02:13:15,130
You work across the street?

1464
02:13:15,797 --> 02:13:16,799
Yeah.

1465
02:13:17,464 --> 02:13:19,098
Diamond exchange?

1466
02:13:19,100 --> 02:13:20,102
That's right.

1467
02:13:23,939 --> 02:13:25,207
Beer's on me.
