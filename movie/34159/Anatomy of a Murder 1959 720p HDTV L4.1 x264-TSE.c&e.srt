00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,500
《桃色血案》

3
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,110
“铁城”

4
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,900
嗨，托伊伯尔。
Hi, Toybull.

5
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,260
嘿，看到你朋友刚驾车回城了，麦卡锡先生。
Hey, your pal just drove into town, Mr. McCarthy.

6
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,210
再给我来一杯，托伊伯尔。
I'll have one more, Toybull.

7
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,510
恐怕我得明天才能付你酒钱。
I'm afraid I'll have to pay my bar bill tomorrow.

8
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,640
我信得过你，麦卡锡先生。
You're good with me, Mr. McCarthy.

9
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,650
谢谢你，托伊伯尔。
Thank you, Toybull.

10
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,610
晚安，托伊伯尔。
Good night, Toybull.

11
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,250
晚安，麦卡锡先生。
Good night, Mr. McCarthy.

12
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:58,420
“保罗・比格勒，律师”

13
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,800
我是接线员。
Operator.

14
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,180
接线员，给我接…
Operator, I want...

15
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,410
雷鸣湾489号。
489 Thunder Bay.

16
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,820
我想和曼尼昂夫人通话。
I want to speak to Mrs. Manion.

17
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,120
曼-尼-昂。
M-A-N-I-O-N.

18
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,290
我是保罗・比格勒。
This is Paul Biegler speaking.

19
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,420
铁城700号。
Iron City 700.

20
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,630
反正你会看。
You do that.

21
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,330
既然你已经偷看了，那么你就…
After you sneak a peek, why, you...

22
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,810
打开你看到的东西吧。
uncork whatever you find.

23
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,320
- 要替你倒点儿吗？
- 荣幸之至。
- Shall I pour?
- Be a privilege.

24
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,020
乐意效劳，先生。
My pleasure, sir.

25
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,620
你和这个士兵单打独斗啊。
You fought this soldier by yourself.

26
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,900
你一直在独斟独饮，保利。
You've been drinking alone, Paulie.

27
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,060
我不喜欢你那样。
I don't like that.

28
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,730
放下你的石头，律师，你自己也
住在玻璃房子里【咱们彼此彼此】。
Drop the stone, counselor.
You live in a glass house.

29
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:47,200
我屋子的窗户很久以前就都被打破了，
所以我想说什么就可以说什么。
My windows have been busted long ago, 
so I can say as I please.

30
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,270
想来根意大利雪茄吗？
Have an Italian cigar?

31
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,540
不，谢谢。
No, thanks.

32
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:56,320
那些发出臭味的植物【抽雪茄】
是你堕落的另一个象征。
Those stinkweeds are another 
sign of your decadence.

33
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,850
保利，这是事实啊。
Paulie, it's a fact.

34
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,360
自从米奇・罗德威克将你
挤出地方检察官办公室，
Since Mitch Lodwick beat you out of 
the office of public prosecutor...

35
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,260
你就成了个废人。
you haven't been worth salt for peanuts.

36
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,530
当然我也理解你的感受。
Not that I don't understand how you feel.

37
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,670
一个人如果从他用了很久的办公室里
被挤了出来，
A man gets beat out of an office 
he's held for a long time...

38
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,340
那么他会觉得遭到了圈内人的摒弃。
he feels his community has deserted him.

39
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,810
他会觉得周围的人对他轻蔑地指指戳戳。
The finger of scorn is pointed at him.

40
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,810
只有孤寂的心灵才会理解我的痛苦。
None but the lonely hearts shall know my anguish.

41
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,980
保利，你是个出色的律师，
你应该表现得像那么回事。
Paulie, you're a good lawyer.
You ought to make like one.

42
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,090
你应该呆在这儿，时刻准备为客户服务，
而不是四处钓钓鱼，或演奏那些…
Be here ready for clients, 
not out fishing and playing that...

43
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,790
唧唧歪歪的爵士乐。
rooty-tooty jazz.

44
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,660
噢，我还是有谋生手段的。
Oh, I'm making a living.

45
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,730
我干些非实质性的活儿――
I run a few abstracts--

46
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,820
时不时地给那些闹离婚的男女们提提建议，
how to divorce Jane Doe 
from John Doe every once in a while.

47
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,530
或是对那些欠债不还的人给些警告。
Threaten a few deadbeats.

48
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,500
而在夜里，我则坐下来喝一杯波旁威士忌，
And in the evening, 
I sit around and drink bourbon whisky...

49
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:49,560
和帕内尔・埃米特・麦卡锡一起研习法律，
and read law with Parnell Emmitt McCarthy...

50
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,040
他是个了不起的人。
one of the world's great men.

51
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,910
那可是对我的溢美之词，保利。
That was a kind word, Paulie.

52
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,780
你知道…
You know...

53
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,780
我以前可能是还不错。
I might have been.

54
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:03,020
这也是为什么我不愿意看到
你的才华被一些庸才所忽略的原因。
That's one of the reasons I hate to see 
your talent pushed aside by lesser men.

55
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,560
我看着你，仿佛看到了多年以前的自己，
I look at you, and I see myself years ago...

56
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,050
那时我也沉醉在那些年久发黄的书籍
所散发出的气味里，
with the same love for the smell 
of the old brown books...

57
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,260
和这样落满灰尘的办公室里。
and the dusty office.

58
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,130
这些是我们的玫瑰，
Here's the rose.

59
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,600
我们的百合，我们亲爱的狼犬。
A lily. A sweet lupine.

60
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:22,040
《美国最高法院报告》。
The United States Supreme Court reports.

61
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,040
那么…
Well...

62
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:27,710
今晚我们读些什么呢，律师？
what shall we read this evening, counselor?

63
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,680
来点儿大法官霍尔姆斯的报告如何？
How about a little Chief Justice Holmes?

64
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:38,050
让大法官稍等一会儿，我可能有客户。
Keep Chief Justice on hold for a moment.
I might have a client.

65
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,650
- 我在等一个电话。你好！
- 比格勒先生吗？
- Waiting for a call. Hello?
- Mr. Biegler?

66
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,890
- 噢，是的，我是保罗・比格勒。
- 你当事人的电话。
- This is Paul Biegler speaking.
- It's your party.

67
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,230
- 喂？曼尼昂夫人吗？
- 什么？
- Hello? Mrs. Manion?
- What?

68
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,960
比格勒先生？
Mr. Biegler?

69
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,400
抱歉刚才没能接通你。
你收到我的留言啦？
I'm sorry I missed you a while ago.
Did you get my message?

70
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,990
- 那是谁？叫什么名字？
- 请稍等一会儿。
- Who is that? What is that name?
- Just a minute, please.

71
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,630
好像电话不太清楚。别挂掉。
We seem to have a bad connection. Hold on.

72
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,110
是个女人，叫曼尼昂。
梅达说她想找我。
It's a woman, name of Manion.
Maida took a message from her.

73
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,080
- 住在雷鸣湾？
- 对，是的。
- In Thunder Bay?
- Uh-huh.

74
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,110
要是她想让你替他丈夫出庭，就说“好的”。
If she wants you to represent her husband, say yes.

75
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,520
- 可是我还不知道这是怎么回事。
- 当作你已经知道好了，先答应了她再说！
- I don't know what it's all about.
- Pretend you do and say yes.

76
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,980
- 喂？
- 比格勒先生？
- Hello?
- Mr. Biegler?

77
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:10,420
噢，是的，现在好多了。
是的，我听得很清楚。
Oh, yes. This is much better now.
Yes, I can hear you fine.

78
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,220
整个下午我一直在等你的电话。
I've waited for your call all afternoon.

79
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:16,230
噢，对不起，我才刚回来。
Yes, well, I just got in a few moments ago,

80
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,850
你看到报上登的我丈夫的事儿了？
毛毛，别这样。
You've read about my husband? 
Muffy, please.

81
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,330
是的。
Yes.

82
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,400
比格勒先生，你读过报上登的
我丈夫的事情吗？毛毛，别这样。
Mr. Biegler, have you read 
about my husband? Muffy, please,

83
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:28,270
唔…嗯，是的，我读了一些。
Well, uh, yes, I have, a little.

84
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,670
- 你会为他辩护吗？
- 呃，我不知道。
- Will you defend him?
- I don't know.

85
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,940
- 我得再多了解一些情况。
- 你愿意和他谈谈吗？
- I'd have to know more about it.
- Will you talk to him?

86
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:36,950
比格勒先生，他现在被关在县监狱。
明天上午你可以见他吗？
Mr. Biegler, he's in the county jail.
Will you see him in the morning?

87
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:40,880
他非常盼望能见到你，
因为有人竭力向他推荐你。
He's very anxious to see you.
You've been so highly recommended.

88
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,720
是吗？
I have?

89
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,990
是的，有人向他提到的你，
你愿意见他吗？
Yes, someone told him about you, 
Will you see him?

90
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,890
好的，我想可以。我明天上午去见他。
I suppose I could. I'll see him tomorrow morning.

91
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,290
- 你想让我也一起去吗？
- 那太好了。
- Would you want me there too?
- I think that'd be fine.

92
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,660
那就10点钟见吧。
Let's make it about 10:00.

93
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,240
谢谢，太谢谢你了！
Thank you, Thank you so much.

94
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,640
嗯，不用那么客气。再见。
Yes, you're quite welcome. Bye.

95
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,330
那么，这究竟是怎么回事？
Now, what's this all about?

96
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,470
有个叫巴尼・奎尔的家伙强奸了曼尼昂夫人。
A man named Barney Quill raped Mrs. Manion.

97
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,810
她的丈夫，他是陆军中尉――
Her husband, he's a lieutenant in the army--

98
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,780
在雷鸣湾有个临时基地，炮兵之类的――
there's a temporary base in Thunder Bay, 
a gunnery or something--

99
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,580
这个中尉来到奎尔的旅店，向他连开了五枪，
The lieutenant goes to Quill's place 
and plugs Mr. Quill about five times...

100
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,520
铅头中毒致使奎尔先生当场殒命。
which causes Mr. Quill to promptly die 
of lead poisoning.

101
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,720
- 这是何时发生的事？
- 几个晚上之前吧。
- When did this happen?
- A couple of nights ago.

102
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,890
要是你没有外出去某个
鸟不拉屎的死水潭钓鱼的话，
If you hadn't been out fishing 
in some godforsaken backwater...

103
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,500
你早就应该听说了。
you'd have known about it.

104
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,670
- 早上好，梅达。
- 噢，你总算回来了。
- Morning, Maida.
- Oh, there it is.

105
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,680
- 怎么啦？
- 报纸。
- What?
- The newspaper.

106
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:48,040
我以为他们可能不再送报来了，
因为我们没付账单。
I thought maybe they didn't bring it.
We haven't paid the bill.

107
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,910
- 你看到我留的条了吗？
- 是的。我们可能会接这个案子。
- Did you get my note?
- Uh-huh. We may be on the case.

108
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:54,250
在去和曼尼昂中尉谈话前，
我正多读点有关案子的情况。
I'm just reading up on it now
before talking to Lt. Manion.

109
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,120
他没回自己家吗？
Doesn't he ever go home?

110
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,210
嗯，你是说帕内尔？
我们昨晚呆到很晚。
Oh, you mean Parnell?
We were up late last night.

111
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,090
像是如此。
Is that a fact?

112
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:04,490
我想你最好取消我今天所有的预约。
I think maybe you better cancel 
all my appointments for today.

113
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,260
还有什么预约？大家都以为
你搬到林子里去住了。
What appointments? People think 
you've migrated into the woods.

114
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,270
如果冰箱里再放些鱼的话，
那么它就会自个儿…
If this refrigerator gets any more
fish in it, it'll swim upstream...

115
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,600
游到上游去产卵了。
and spawn all by itself.

116
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,940
对不起，能稍微打断你一下吗？
May I have your attention for a moment, please?

117
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,780
我昨天看了一下你的支票本。
I was going over your checkbook yesterday.

118
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,010
我开不出给我的薪水了。
I can't pay me my salary.

119
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,590
你怎么把沃尔克夫妇的离婚诉讼费花光的？
What did you do with the fee 
for the Walkers' divorce?

120
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,990
拿去帮着往某个铀矿里掺假啦？
Help salt a uranium mine or something?

121
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:36,820
- 仅买了些生活必需品。
- 比如说那艘舷外马达艇。
- Bought a few bare necessities.
- Like a new outboard motor.

122
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:40,090
我希望我也能被归入必需品之列。
I wish I could be classed as a necessity.

123
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,600
- 要烤面包吗？
- 不…不了。我会…呃…
- Aren't you gonna have your toast?
- No, no, I'll, uh--

124
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,140
我会打电话给你，告诉你事情的进展情况。
I'll call you, let you know how things are going.

125
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,730
小心别让他的“紫心勋章”收买了你。
Don't let him pay you off in Purple Hearts.

126
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,440
那些职业当兵的穷得丁当响。
Those professional soldiers never have a dime.

127
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:55,140
我知道的，我以前嫁过一个。
I ought to know. I was married to one.

128
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,970
对不起，你是曼尼昂夫人？
Beg your pardon. Are you Mrs. Manion?

129
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,370
- 你好。
- 我是保罗・比格勒。
- Hi.
- I'm Paul Biegler.

130
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,410
- 我叫劳拉。
- 你好。
- I'm Laura.
- How do you do?

131
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,780
- 这是毛毛。
- 噢，毛毛。
- This is Muff.
- Oh, Muff.

132
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,780
监狱就在那边。
The jail's right here.

133
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,470
你挺高哈。
You're tall.

134
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,650
- 你好，保利！
- 嗨，苏罗。
- Hello, Paulie!
- Hi, Sulo.

135
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,660
你在这儿等着，毛毛。
You wait here, Muffy.

136
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,600
- 见到你真高兴，保利。
- 你怎么样？
- Good to see you, Paulie.
- How you feeling?

137
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,460
还行。我想你是来见那个当兵的吧。
Fine. I guess you come for the soldier boy.

138
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,330
没错。我们可不可以
在警官的办公室里进行谈话呢？
Yeah. Do you think it'd be all right 
if we talk in the sheriff's office?

139
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,500
噢，当然可以，保利。我把他带过来。
Oh, sure, Paulie. I'll bring him down.

140
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,410
你不介意把眼镜摘掉吧，曼尼昂夫人？
Would you mind taking your glasses off, Mrs. Manion?

141
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,530
天哪！那是巴尼・奎尔干的吗？
Did Barney Quill do that to you?

142
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,600
是的，远不止这些。
Mm-hmm. More than that.

143
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,600
你应该看看，全身上下都有。
You should see. All over.

144
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,430
要是你觉得那样更自在一点的话，
你还是戴上吧。
You can put them back on 
if it's more comfortable for you.

145
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,480
这位是保利・比格勒。
保利，这就是你要的人。
This is Paulie Biegler.
This is the bucko, Paulie.

146
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,910
- 你好。
- 嗨，曼尼。
- Hello, there.
- Hi, Manny.

147
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,920
嗨，劳拉。
Hello, Laura.

148
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:47,020
曼尼昂夫人，今天下午2点左右，
你可以去我办公室见我吗？
Mrs. Manion, can you meet me down in
my office about 2:00 this afternoon?

149
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,150
地址是巴恩汉西街305号。
It's 305 West Barnham.

150
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,290
- 当然可以。
- 那好。
- Of course.
- Fine.

151
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,990
你需要什么东西吗，亲爱的？
Is there anything I can get you, hon?

152
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,000
不需要什么，亲爱的。
I'm all right, hon.

153
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,330
到里面来。
Right in here.

154
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,450
通缉犯，前十名。
Wanted. The big ten.

155
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,660
人们评出了最佳服饰女士前十名，
They got the ten best-dressed dames...

156
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,190
最佳球队前十名，最佳曲子前十名，
the ten top teams, the ten top tunes...

157
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,020
而这里是最高通缉犯前十名。
and now the ten most wanted.

158
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:27,400
嗯，别这么说，那也是一种美国梦。
那些家伙也算是成功了。
Don't knock it. That's the American dream.
Those boys made the grade.

159
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,800
你曾经是…
You were the...

160
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,930
这个地区的检察官，是吗？
district attorney around here, weren't you?

161
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,100
嗯哼，干了十年。
Ten years.

162
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,230
那么你干辩护律师有什么经验呢？
What's your experience as a defense lawyer?

163
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:41,140
- 不算很多。
- 我怎么知道你能应付我的案子？
- Not very much.
- How do I know you can handle my case?

164
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,150
我想你当然不知道。
I guess you don't know.

165
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,220
何不妨我们谈谈呢？
Shall we talk about it?

166
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,750
只能这样了。
I suppose so.

167
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,490
行了，中尉。别这么灰心丧气。
Come on, Lieutenant. Don't be so bored.

168
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:55,960
你知道，也许没有哪个律师
能够应付你的案子，
It might very well be that no lawyer 
can handle your case...

169
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,260
如果你的目标是想完全逃脱罪责的话。
if you mean getting you off scot-free.

170
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,560
你大概忘了巴尼・奎尔强奸了我的妻子。
You seemed to be forgetting 
Barney Quill raped my wife.

171
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,760
不成文的【道德】法律是站在我这一边的。
I have the unwritten law on my side.

172
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,630
不成文法只是一个神话，中尉。
The unwritten law's a myth, Lieutenant.

173
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,440
根本没有什么不成文法这回事儿。
There is no such thing as the unwritten law.

174
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,510
任何人只要犯了谋杀罪，
而且这种说法得到了证实，
And anyone who commits a murder 
on the theory that it does exist...

175
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:15,710
那么他就会被关入州监狱，
在里面吃喝拉撒，
has just bought himself room and board 
in the state penitentiary.

176
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,540
也许得终身服刑。
Maybe for life.

177
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:22,650
了解了这些，也许我们接着可以…
Now, with that in mind, 
perhaps we can proceed with a...

178
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,220
从一些问答开始――
few questions and answers that--

179
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:28,490
也就是…呃…
能借你打火机用一下吗？
That, uh--
Can I borrow your lighter?

180
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:35,860
我们可以开始一些个问答，
那也许会有助于你的辩护。
We can proceed with a few questions and 
answers that might help your defense.

181
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,640
当然也有可能没什么用。
But it probably won't be.

182
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,940
是啊，打火机不错。
Yes. Nice lighter.

183
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,750
- 好吧。
- 你多大了？
- Okay.
- How old are you?

184
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:53,320
- 二十八岁。
- 服役多少年了？
- Twenty-eight.
- How long have you been in the service?

185
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,410
50年参的军。
Since '50.

186
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,080
- 参加过战斗吗？
- 韩战。
- You see any action?
- Korea.

187
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,560
- 授过勋吗？
- 很多。
- Have any decorations?
- Plenty.

188
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,220
- 这是你的第一次婚姻？
- 不是。
- Is this your first marriage?
- No.

189
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,360
这不是在证人席上，
你不必只回答“是”或“不是”。
You're not on the witness stand.
You don't have to answer yes or no.

190
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:10,530
多给我讲一点你们的婚姻状况。
Just give me the matrimonial rundown.

191
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,830
- 有必要吗？
- 有没有必要得由我说了算。
- Is this necessary?
- I'll be the judge of that.

192
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,130
我的第一个妻子和我离了婚。
My first wife divorced me.

193
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,970
说我虐待了她。
Charged cruelty.

194
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,810
其实只是些在床上吃吃饼干之类的事，
你知道，都是些鸡毛蒜皮的小事儿。
Eating crackers in bed.
You know, the usual stuff.

195
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,440
事实的真相是…
Truth was...

196
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:29,080
我在朝鲜时她有了另一个家伙。
she found another guy when I was in Korea.

197
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,690
四年前我在佐治亚州遇见了劳拉。
I met Laura four years ago in Georgia.

198
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,320
在她离婚后我们就马上结婚了。
We were married right after her divorce.

199
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,900
你认识她丈夫吗？
Did you know the husband?

200
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,270
- 他是我手下的。
- 你是说你们是伙伴？
- He was in my outfit down there.
- You mean, you were buddies?

201
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,770
好吧，我不接着问了，
可能显得有些不合时宜。
I'll withdraw the question.
It's a little old-fashioned.

202
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:51,400
你们两个的婚姻中
有没有孩子来自于哪一方呢？
Have there been any children 
by or from any of these marriages?

203
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,710
- 没有。
- 对将来有什么打算吗？
- No.
- Any present prospects?

204
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,080
没什么特别的，直到出了巴尼・奎尔这件事。
Not unless Barney Quill started something.

205
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,340
你用什么枪打的奎尔？
What kind of a gun did you use?

206
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:02,790
战争后留下的，是把鲁格尔手枪。
现在在警察这儿。
War souvenir. A Luger.
The police have it now.

207
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:06,020
我想你读过报纸上登的
有关你案子的那些事吧？
I suppose you've read the newspapers, 
the stories about your case.

208
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:09,820
- 读过一些。
- 那它们是不是基本属实呢？
- Some of them.
- Are they substantially correct?

209
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:13,020
- 是的。
- 那么你并没有看见奎尔强奸并殴打你的妻子？
- Yes.
- And you didn't see Quill rape and beat your wife?

210
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:15,190
是的，没有。
No. No.

211
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,630
当她回来后…
When she got back...

212
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,710
回到我们的车房后，她告诉我所发生的事。
to the trailer, she told me what had happened.

213
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:22,600
在你去奎尔的酒吧并杀死他之前，
那有多长时间？
And how long was it before you went 
over to Quill's and killed him?

214
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,570
我不知道精确的时间，可能有一小时吧。
I don't know exactly. Maybe an hour.

215
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,110
那么长时间，嗯？
That long, huh?

216
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:30,670
报纸上说你妻子自愿接受测谎仪测试。
The newspapers say that your wife 
volunteered to take a lie detector test.

217
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,180
- 这你知道吗？
- 我也是从报纸上读到的，她也是这样跟我说的。
- Do you know anything about this?
- Only what I read and what she told me.

218
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,810
你知道测谎仪的测试结果吗？
Do you know how the lie detector test turned out?

219
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,320
他们没告诉她。
They didn't tell her.

220
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,790
- 什么事，苏罗？
- 监狱里的中饭好了。
- Yes, Sulo?
- We got lunch served for the jail.

221
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:45,690
- 你想和我们一起吃吗？
- 你姐姐还在监狱里做饭？
- You want to eat with us?
- Your sister still cook for the jail?

222
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,700
噢，是的，她还在做。
Oh, sure. She cooks.

223
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,960
那么请转达我对她的问候，苏罗。
Well, you give her my compliments, Sulo.

224
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,040
我在市里还有个午餐约会。
I've got a luncheon date downtown.

225
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,230
- 走好，比格勒先生。
- 午饭后我会回来。
- Nice going, Mr. Biegler.
- I'll be back after lunch.

226
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,800
你瞧，如果刚才有所冒犯的话，请你原谅。
Look, I'm sorry if I offended you a while ago.

227
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,850
不，你没有。
No, you're not.

228
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,250
行了，伙计。
Come on, bucko.

229
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,910
谢谢。
Thank you.

230
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,290
把盐递给我，保利。
Pass the salt, Paulie.

231
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,520
谢谢。
Thank you.

232
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,290
你有没有给中尉好好地上一课呢？
Did you give the lieutenant the well known lecture?

233
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:24,030
如果你是问我有没有教他编个谎，回答是“没有”。
If you mean, did I coach him into a phony story, no.

234
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,930
也许你太单纯了，保罗，
Maybe you're too pure, Paul.

235
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,810
对法律中所固有的缺陷来说，你太单纯了。
Too pure for the natural impurities of the law.

236
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,940
要么你就给中尉个机会，
让他另外请人替他辩护；
Could be that you owe the lieutenant 
the chance to find a defense.

237
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,710
要么你就稍微点拨他一下，给他指条道，
Could also be that you might guide him 
a little, show him the way...

238
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,980
让他自己决定何去何从。
and let him decide if he wants to take it.

239
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,610
- 要盐吗？
- 不，我还没剥完。
- Want some salt?
- No, I'm not ready.

240
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,120
总之，我不是做这家伙律师的合适人选。
Anyway, I'm not the right lawyer for this fellow.

241
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,490
他有点傲慢，有点敌意……
He's insolent, hostile--

242
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:52,120
你没必要喜欢上他，替他辩护就成。
You don't have to love him. Just defend him.

243
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,260
怎么回事儿？你不缺钱啦？
What's the matter? Don't you need a fee?

244
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:59,230
你知道吗？我倒是认为
你可能有点害怕了。
You know something? I think 
you might be a little bit afraid.

245
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:03,170
- 害怕什么？
- 害怕你可能会栽在这上面。
- Afraid of what?
- That you might get licked.

246
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:10,210
你知道比费城律师【精明的律师】
更加狡猾的是谁吗？
You know, there's only one thing more 
devious than a Philadelphia lawyer...

247
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,410
那就是爱尔兰律师【麦卡锡是爱尔兰姓】。
and that's an Irish lawyer.

248
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,040
把盐给我。
Pass the salt.

249
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,790
放下来，放下来。
Put it down.

250
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:30,160
- 嗨，你好。
- 我通常只对叫我保罗的人打招呼。
- Hello there.
- I usually answer to the name Paul.

251
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,170
你还有别的笑话吗？
You gonna have some more jokes?

252
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,300
除非你想成为滑稽演员。
Not unless you want to be the comic.

253
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:38,100
噢，我给你带了些烟卷。
Oh, I brought you some cigarettes.

254
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,110
- 哦，谢谢了！
- 讲和了？
- Oh, thanks.
- Peace?

255
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:43,200
- 当然。
- 那好，很好。那么中尉…
- Sure.
- Fine, fine. Now, Lieutenant...

256
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,620
有四种方式我可以替谋杀案辩护：
there are four ways I can defend murder.

257
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,310
第一，那不是谋杀，
那是自杀或者事故；
Number one, it wasn't murder.
It was suicide or accidental.

258
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:53,420
第二，不是你干的；
第三，可以证明你的合法性，
Number two, you didn't do it.
Number three, you were legally justified...

259
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,690
比如说为了保护你的家人或是正当防卫；
like the protection of your home or self-defense.

260
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,700
第四，你有杀人的理由。
Number four, the killing was excusable.

261
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,500
那么我符合这美好前景的哪一条呢？
Where do I fit in to this rosy picture?

262
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,870
我先来告诉你你不符合哪一条吧：
其实前三条你都不符合。
I'll tell you where you don't fit in.
You don't fit in any of the first three.

263
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,880
为什么？为什么不能证明
我杀死强奸我妻子的人是合法的？
Why? Why wouldn't I be legally justified 
in killing the man who raped my wife?

264
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,640
时间因素。
Time element.

265
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,080
如果你是当场抓住他的，
那么也许可以证明你开枪合法，
If you'd caught him in the act, 
the shooting might have been justified...

266
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,150
但是你并没有当场抓住他，
而且你有时间叫警察，
but you didn't catch him in the act, 
and you had time to bring the police...

267
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,910
这你也没做。
and you didn't do that either.

268
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,920
你会因谋杀而被判有罪――
预谋的、报复性的谋杀罪。
You're guilty of murder--
premeditated and with vengeance.

269
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,220
在任何法庭，这都是一级谋杀罪。
That's first-degree murder in any court of law.

270
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,890
- 你是不是想让我服罪？
- 如果我建议你认罪，我会告诉你的。
- Are you telling me to plead guilty?
- When I advise a cop out, you'll know.

271
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,660
- 认罪？
- 就是服罪并请求宽恕。
- Cop out?
- That's plead guilty and ask for mercy.

272
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,170
如果你这不是在建议我认罪，
那么你是在建议我干嘛？
If you're not telling me to cop out, 
what are you telling me to do?

273
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,170
我没建议你干任何事情。
I'm not telling you to do anything.

274
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:40,360
我只是想让你了解下法律上是怎么说的。
I just want you to understand the letter of the law.

275
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,770
- 那你就继续。
- 继续什么？
- Go on.
- Go on with what?

276
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,740
继续你想说的啊。
Whatever it is you're getting at.

277
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:57,350
你知道，你很聪明，中尉。
You know, you're very bright, Lieutenant.

278
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:02,420
那就让我们看看你究竟能有多聪明。
Now let's see how really bright you can be.

279
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,390
好吧，那我就加把劲。
Well, I'm working at it.

280
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,770
好的，听着，因为你妻子遭到强奸，
All right. Now, because your wife was raped...

281
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,270
在法庭上，会形成有利于你的氛围。
you'll have a favorable atmosphere in the courtroom.

282
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:17,170
如果所有情况都属实的话，
你会受到同情。
The sympathy will be with you 
if all the facts are true.

283
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,870
你所需要的是某种法律上的借口，
这样陪审团就会站在你的角度上同情你。
What you need is a legal peg so the jury 
can hang their sympathy in your behalf.

284
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,480
你明白我的意思吗？
You follow me?

285
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,420
那么你的合法借口是什么呢，中尉？
What's your legal excuse, Lieutenant?

286
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,920
你杀死巴尼・奎尔的合法借口是什么？
What's your legal excuse for killing Barney Quill?

287
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:37,290
没有正当理由哈？
Not justification?

288
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,830
没有正当理由。
Not justification.

289
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,470
借口。
Excuse.

290
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,610
正当的借口。
Just excuse.

291
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,090
有什么借口呢？
What excuses are there?

292
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,860
我怎么知道？是你把奎尔干掉的。
How should I know?
You're the one that plugged Quill.

293
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,800
- 我当时可能【气】疯了。
- 什么意思？
- I must've been mad.
- How's that?

294
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:17,530
我说我当时可能【气】疯了。
I said I must've been mad.

295
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:24,300
不，恶劣情绪不能作为借口。
No, bad temper's no excuse.

296
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:29,450
我是说，我可能发疯了。
I mean, I must've been crazy.

297
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:36,520
这样是不是有点希望了？
Am I getting warmer?

298
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,090
好吧，我们回头再见。
Okay. See you around.

299
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,960
这样是不是有点希望了？
Am I getting warmer?

300
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:49,000
在我和你妻子谈过以后，咱们再聊吧。
I'll tell you that after I talk to your wife.

301
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,830
与此同时，你好好回想一下
你当时怎样个发疯法。
In the meantime, see if you can 
remember just how crazy you were.

302
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:02,140
曼尼昂夫人来了吗？
Is Mrs. Manion here yet?

303
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,440
她已经等了很长时间了。
She's been waiting quite a while.

304
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,750
她把你的所有唱片集都过了一遍，
从迪克西兰【南方爵士乐】到布鲁贝克【爵士乐作曲家】。
She's been through all your albums, 
from Dixieland to Brubeck.

305
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,480
你认为她怎么样？
What do you think of her?

306
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:13,320
很温柔、易相处，是那种男人
喜欢占、而且去占她便宜的…
Soft. Easy. The kind men like 
to take advantage of...

307
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,150
女人。
and do.

308
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,200
你拿到钱啦？
Did you get any money?

309
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,390
- 钱。
- 噢，没有。
- Money.
- Oh. Oh, no.

310
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,630
我还没决定是否接这个案子。
I haven't decided to take the case yet.

311
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,230
你知道，有时你真令我感到意外。
You know, you surprise me sometimes.

312
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:28,240
为什么？我一直是这样的。
Why? I've been around.

313
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,650
我…呃…
I, uh...

314
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,330
希望你不介意。
hope you don't mind.

315
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,220
我想我们最好谈谈。
I think we'd better talk.

316
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,590
你好像是个有趣的律师。
You're a funny kind of a lawyer.

317
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,070
我是说这音乐。
The music, I mean.

318
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:57,140
律师就不能喜欢音乐了吗？
Aren't lawyers supposed to like music?

319
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,800
唔，不是这种音乐。
Well, not that kind of music.

320
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:03,710
哦，那我就承认好了，
我是个有趣的律师。
Oh. I guess that settles it.
I'm a funny kind of lawyer.

321
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,640
你老家在哪里，曼尼昂夫人？
Where's your home, Mrs. Manion?

322
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:08,370
你在哪儿上的学？
你在哪儿长大的？
Where did you go to school?
Where did you live when you were young?

323
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,750
没有什么特别固定的地方，
我们总是四处搬迁。
No place in particular.
We sort of moved around.

324
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:15,180
我父亲是流动工人，流动建筑工人，
主要是建造水坝。
My father was a construction boomer.
Building dams, mostly.

325
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,890
你可以喊我劳拉。
You can call me Laura.

326
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,230
那么你家人还健在吗，劳拉？
Is your family still alive, Laura?

327
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,660
不在了。
No.

328
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,030
我不知道，我应该有香烟的，
不知道放哪儿了。
I don't know. I have some 
cigarettes around here someplace.

329
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,290
- 你想抽烟吗？
- 不，我是想给你找一根。
- Do you want a cigarette?
- No, I want to offer you one.

330
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,800
- 你可以帮我点上。
- 噢，当然。
- You could light it for me.
- Oh, yes.

331
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,540
给你。
Here.

332
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,730
和你丈夫的一样哈。
That's just like your husband's.

333
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,710
他给了我这个因为我喜欢他用的那种。
He gave me this because I liked the one he had.

334
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:44,480
他就是这样，总是送我礼物。
He's like that. 
He gives me presents all the time.

335
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,910
- 你们婚姻很幸福？
- 是的。
- Do you have a happy marriage?
- Yes.

336
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,790
那么你的第一次婚姻出了什么问题？
What went wrong with the first marriage?

337
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:55,020
唔，问题出在我喜欢上了曼尼。
Well, what when wrong is when I went for Manny.

338
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:57,100
哇喔，你可够坦诚的。
Well, that's honest enough.

339
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,890
当然不只是因为这个。
就像我刚才说的，我习惯了四处为家，可是…
It was more than just that.
Like I said, I grew up on the move, and...

340
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,560
杰克――就是我的第一个丈夫――
杰克不喜欢搬家。
Jack-- that was my first husband--
Jack didn't like to move.

341
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,930
甚至有好的机会，他都不愿意迁居。
He wouldn't even take a transfer 
when he had the chance.

342
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,010
我感到很无聊。
I was really bored.

343
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:12,670
曼尼喜欢动。只要有机会，
我们就一直东奔西走。
Manny likes to go. We're always going 
whenever we get the chance.

344
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,800
我们到过许多地方。
我感到口渴。
We've been all over.
I'm thirsty.

345
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,970
要水呢，还是来杯啤酒？
Water, or would a beer do?

346
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,750
我想啤酒最好了。
I think a beer would do fine.

347
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:23,050
梅达，给我拿瓶啤酒来，行吗？
Maida, bring me a bottle of beer, will you?

348
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,390
- 你结婚了吗？
- 没有。
- Are you married?
- No.

349
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:30,890
不错啊。
That's nice.

350
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,790
你没结婚，一个人守着
这么大的房子干什么呢？
What do you do alone in this house 
if you aren't married?

351
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,630
唔，这是祖上留下来的住宅，
我是这个家族的最后一位。
Well, it's a family home, 
and I'm the last of the family.

352
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,640
- 给你啤酒。
- 谢谢。
- There you are.
- Thank you.

353
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:42,570
- 你不来一杯吗？
- 不，现在不喝。
- Aren't you having one?
- No, not right now.

354
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,240
给你。
There you are.

355
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:49,470
能不能用那个烟灰缸给毛毛也来点儿？
他喜欢喝啤酒。
Could Muff have a little 
in that ashtray? He loves beer.

356
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:52,210
你想给你的小狗喝啤酒？
You want a beer for the dog?

357
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,290
好吧，给你。
Well, here we are.

358
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,590
喝完他就该睡了。
He'll go to sleep now.

359
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,360
- 他是不是很乖巧？
- 是的。
- Isn't he cute?
- Yeah.

360
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,430
怎么样？你准备好了吗？
How about it? Are you ready?

361
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:14,500
我的意思是，你准备好
告诉我案子的情况了吗？
I mean, are you ready 
to tell me the story?

362
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,510
我知道你什么意思。
I know what you mean.

363
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:21,210
好吧，那么你就把和州警谈过的
所有事情都和我谈谈吧，
Now, suppose you tell me everything 
you told the state police...

364
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:24,250
还有你没有告诉州警的所有事情。
plus everything you didn't tell the state police.

365
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,590
- 从何谈起？
- 你什么时候离开家去奎尔的酒吧的？
- Where should I begin?
- When did you leave for Quill's bar?

366
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:33,150
吃完晚饭后就去了，
我想大约在8点半左右。
Right after dinner. 
About 8:30, I guess.

367
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,590
曼尼从射击场回家时已经很晚了，
Manny was late getting home 
from the firing range...

368
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:38,460
于是我们一起吃了晚饭，
然后他就倒头睡了。
so we had dinner, 
he laid down and went to sleep.

369
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,360
我几乎一整天都闷在车房内，所以我就…
I hadn't been out of the trailer all day, so...

370
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:44,160
我带上毛毛和一只便携灯，走路去了酒吧。
I took Muff and a flashlight 
and walked over to the bar.

371
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,100
我要了一杯酒，玩了会儿弹球机。
I bought a drink and played the pinball machine.

372
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:50,700
- 酒吧里人很多吗？
- 唔…不多。
- Many people in the bar?
- Mm-mm. Not many.

373
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:53,400
巴尼走了过来，让我和他比赛游戏。
Barney came over and challenged me to a game.

374
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:56,680
- 输了就喝酒，你知道？
- 你和巴尼很熟吗？
- For drinks, you know?
- How well did you know Barney?

375
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:00,450
唔，酒吧是他开的，
曼尼和我有时会去，仅此而已。
Well, he owned this bar where 
Manny and I went sometimes, that's all.

376
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,520
他有没有向你调过情呢？
Had he ever made a pass at you?

377
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,920
没有，从没有这样的事。
No. Nothing like that at all.

378
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,620
那晚他喝了很多吗？
Was he drinking heavily that night?

379
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,530
看上去没有，至少他和我玩球时看不出来。
Didn't seem to be. At least 
not when we were playing pinball.

380
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,390
你在那儿就一直和他在一起吗？
Were you with him the whole time you were there?

381
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,560
不，还有其他人也在玩。
No, there were other people playing too.

382
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:19,160
你是什么时候离开酒吧的？
And what time did you leave the bar?

383
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,670
嗯，我想大约在11点左右。
Oh, about 11:00, I guess.

384
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:25,970
我从边门离开的。
毛毛带着便携灯，
I left by the side door.
Muff was carrying the flashlight.

385
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,100
他用嘴巴夹着。他太乖了，
He carries it in his mouth. He's so cute...

386
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:29,910
走在前面用便携灯开路。
running along ahead with the light shining.

387
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:33,010
- 他清醒吗？
- 毛毛？当然他很清醒。
- Was he sober?
- Muff? Of course he was sober.

388
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,810
噢，你这是开玩笑，是吗？
Oh, you're joking now, aren't you?

389
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,190
是的，我是开玩笑。请继续。
Yes, I'm joking. Go on.

390
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,820
这时，巴尼不知从哪儿冒了出来，
Well, Barney came from somewhere.

391
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:42,690
不是从我离开的那道门。
Not the door I left by.

392
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,590
他说他和我同路，可以开车送我回家。
And he said he was going my way 
and he could drive me home.

393
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,630
他说夜里经常有野熊出没，
我不应该独自走回家。
He said the bears had been prowling 
around, and I oughtn't to walk home.

394
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,030
野熊在夜里从林子里出来觅食。
The bears come out of the woods at night to scavenge.

395
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,110
但是它们不会伤害到谁，不是吗？
They're harmless enough, aren't they?

396
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:56,770
是的，要是在白天我也不会感到害怕，
Yeah, I suppose I wouldn't have been 
afraid in the daylight...

397
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,070
但是夜里就不一样了，你知道。
but the dark isn't the same.

398
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:02,170
是的，我理解。
于是你就坐进了巴尼的车里……
Yes, I know. I know.
Now, you got into Barney's car--

399
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,580
我坐了进去，他开着车，
直接回了停放车房的公园。
I got in and he drove 
straight to the trailer park.

400
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,780
- 他没提什么事吗？
- 没有，没说什么。
- He made overtures?
- No, nothing.

401
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:10,880
当我们到达公园时，
自动大门已经关上了。
When we got to the trailer park, 
the auto gate was closed.

402
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:14,620
莱蒙先生大概会在11点
或稍晚一点关上大门。
Mr. Lemon closes it about 11:00 
or a little after.

403
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:17,290
于是我就谢了巴尼，想从车里出来，
So I thanked Barney and started 
to get out of the car...

404
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,230
但是他说我没必要走一段路，
but he said that there wasn't 
any need for me to walk...

405
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:23,130
他可以从另一条道送我进公园。
that he could drive me 
into the park on another road.

406
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,400
我不知道还有另一条道，但是…
I didn't know there was another road, but...

407
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,340
没容我回答愿不愿意，他就接着开了。
he drove on before I could say yes or no.

408
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,000
- 你害怕了吗？
- 没有。
- Were you alarmed?
- No.

409
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,140
我通常不害怕男人。
I'm not usually afraid of men.

410
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:36,810
不管怎么说，他没碰过我，
甚至一路上他都没说什么。
And anyway, he hadn't touched me 
or even said anything out of the way.

411
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,650
唔，女人是不是都有某种天生的直觉，
Well, doesn't a woman sort of instinctively know...

412
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,310
会感受到不怀好意的男人？
when a fellow's on the make?

413
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,390
噢，当然，我经常碰到这样的男人。
Oh, sure, but that's only usual with me.

414
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:48,950
我是说，各种各样的男人，
从我还是孩子时就见过。
With men, I mean. Almost all men.
Ever since I was a kid.

415
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,500
比如说你，你也有兴趣……
You, for instance. You're interested...

416
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,500
但是没有理由要害怕你。
but there's no reason to be afraid of you.

417
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,620
巴尼也给我这样的感觉。
It was like that with Barney.

418
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,900
噢，曼尼昂夫人，请相信我，
我对你一点也没有……
Well, Mrs. Manion, believe me,
I'm not in the least--

419
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,200
叫我劳拉。
Call me Laura.

420
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:06,580
劳拉，我的兴趣仅限于
帮助你的丈夫，没有别的。
Laura, I'm only interested 
in helping your husband. Nothing more.

421
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,150
我不是说你想怎么样。
I don't mean you'd try anything.

422
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:13,010
我只是说你…你看我的样子。
I just mean it's--it's the way 
you look at me.

423
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:17,020
唔，不看着你那倒是很难。
It would be very difficult 
not to look at you.

424
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,920
哦，你是说我的穿着吗？
你不喜欢吗？
Oh, the way I dress, you mean?
You don't like it?

425
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:22,790
噢，我喜欢，很喜欢。
Oh, I love it. I just love it.

426
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:26,960
噢，我们还是言归正传吧。
Now, we'd better keep moving 
along with this thing.

427
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:31,020
那么，那晚你穿的什么？
Now, how were you dressed that night?

428
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,870
噢，像这样的一件厚运动衫和一条裙子。
Oh, in a sweater like this and a skirt.

429
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:36,410
其它的呢…还有什么？
And the rest-- what about that?

430
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:40,810
内衣吗？我穿了连身薄衬衣、短衬裤和胸罩。
Underneath? I had on a slip and panties and a bra.

431
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:43,640
- 没系腰带？
- 我不需要腰带。
- No girdle?
- I don't need a girdle.

432
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,610
你认为我需要系腰带吗？
Do you think I do?

433
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,780
我不知道，我哪知道。
我怎么会知……
I don't know. I don't know.
How should I--

434
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:53,120
听着，我只关心一些事实，
Look, I'm only concerned with a few facts...

435
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:55,620
那些可能有助于我
替你丈夫进行辩护的事实。
that might be of help to me 
in the defense of your husband.

436
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:58,320
- 仅此而已。
- 那好，我不系腰带。
- That's all.
- Well, I don't wear one.

437
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:01,020
好的，没系腰带，好的。
Okay. No girdle. Okay.

438
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:02,430
行了，接着说。
All right. Go on.

439
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:06,270
然后他就离开了大路，
拐进了林中的小径，
Well, he turned off the highway 
into a lane in the woods...

440
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:08,640
他把车停了下来，关上了灯。
and he stopped the car and turned off the lights.

441
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,370
然后他就抓住我，对我说：
And then he grabbed me, and he said...

442
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,710
“我想要强奸你。”他就是这样说的。
"I'm going to rape you," just like that.

443
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:16,780
- 他用的这些词吗？
- 原文复述。
- Did he use those words?
- Exactly those words.

444
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,320
毛毛叫了起来，
于是他把他扔出了窗子。
Muff began to bark, 
so he threw him out the window.

445
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:22,880
我可以听见小毛毛在车外呜呜直叫。
I could hear little Muffy whining 
outside the car all through it.

446
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:26,520
巴尼开始试图占有我，
And Barney began to try to get at me...

447
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:29,790
我奋力想把他挡开，但是他太强壮了。
and I fought him off as best I could, 
but he was terribly strong.

448
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,190
你喊叫了吗？你呼救了吗？
Did you cry out? Did you scream?

449
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,990
在林子里面，喊叫也没什么用处。
Didn't seem to be much use 
out there in the woods.

450
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,530
他开始冲着我大骂，比如…
He began to shout names at me, like...

451
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,970
“军中荡妇”之类的。
"Army slut" and other names.

452
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:42,630
然后他仰着身子，用拳头猛打我。
And then he drew back 
and hit me with his fist.

453
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,470
他又打了几下，我就不再挣扎了。
He hit me again, and I didn't fight anymore.

454
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:49,410
我可能已经失去了一半意识，但是…
I must have been only half-conscious, but...

455
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:53,210
我知道他扯掉了我的内裤，
做了他想做的事。
I know that he tore my panties off 
and did what he wanted.

456
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,410
但是报纸上说医生检查过你，
Now, the newspaper said 
that a doctor examined you...

457
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,490
说他们并不认为你受到过强奸。
and said that he didn't think you'd been raped.

458
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:02,360
我不管医生怎么说。
女人不会把这样的事情弄错的。
I don't care what the doctor thought.
A woman doesn't mistake these things.

459
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,450
好吧，好吧。请继续。
All right. All right. Now, go ahead.

460
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,800
然后，我…
Well, I--

461
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,930
我不确定接着发生了什么，
我肯定晕过去了。但是…
I don't know exactly what happened then.
I must've fainted. But...

462
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,230
接下来我所记得的事是，
车子又动了起来。
the next thing I remember, 
the car was moving.

463
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,140
巴尼开得很快，
Barney was driving very fast...

464
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,370
他喘着粗气，
and he was breathing hard...

465
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,910
丑陋的喘气声。
an ugly, gasping sound.

466
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,510
我们又上了通往公园的主路，
We were on the main road to the trailer park...

467
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:28,420
他在大门旁疾转车身，停了下来。
and he swung in by the gate and stopped.

468
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,890
我打开车门想下车，
毛毛衔着便携灯先跳了下去。
I opened the door to get out.
Muffy jumped out first with a flashlight.

469
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,520
嗯，等一下，
Now, wait a minute.

470
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:37,560
我想你刚才说过在林子里
他把毛毛扔出了车外。
I thought you said he'd thrown Muff 
out of the car back in the woods.

471
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:40,100
噢，是的，但是我们回到那儿时
毛毛也在车上。
Well, he did, but Muff was in the car 
when we got back.

472
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,220
他可能让毛毛回到了车上。
我记不太清了。
He must've let him back in.
I don't remember.

473
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:45,830
好吧。你打开了车门，
毛毛先下了车。然后呢？
All right. You opened the door,
and Muff got out first. All right.

474
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,730
我刚想下车，
Before I could get out...

475
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,210
巴尼一把抓住了我，
说他要把我所有的衣服撕掉，
Barney grabbed me and said he was gonna 
tear all my clothes off...

476
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,900
并又开始向我袭击。
and attacked me again.

477
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:55,340
我挣脱开他逃了出来。
我看见毛毛穿过了篱笆上的一个开口，
I got away and ran. I could see Muff 
through an opening in the fence.

478
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:58,580
他衔着便携灯，来来回回地奔跑着。
He was scooting back and forth with a flashlight.

479
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:02,850
巴尼从背后抓住了我，我摔倒在地。
Barney caught me from behind, 
and I fell to the ground.

480
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:05,790
他压在我上面，又开始用拳头打我。
He fell on top of me and began 
to beat me again with his fists.

481
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,720
我想他可能会杀了我。
I thought he was going to kill me.

482
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:12,420
我大声尖叫，不知怎的
我又站了起来开始猛跑。
I screamed and somehow got 
to my feet again and ran.

483
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,430
我跑过篱笆门，
I went through the opening in the fence...

484
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:17,560
跟着毛毛，他一直带着便携灯跑在我前面。
and followed Muffy, who was running 
along ahead with the flashlight.

485
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:20,600
我跟着便携灯的灯光，
直到来到我们的车房跟前。
And I kept following the light 
until he led me to our trailer.

486
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,770
那么你再没见过巴尼了吗？
And you didn't see Barney again?

487
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:25,370
无论死活，我再也没见过他。
Never laid eyes on him again, dead or alive.

488
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,510
好吧，我…呃…
Well, I, uh--

489
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:30,640
我想暂且到此为止吧。
I think that's enough for now.

490
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:33,950
我有的是时间，只要你愿意。
I've got lots of time. All you want.

491
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,890
- 我怎样才能联系到你？
- 我仍然住在雷鸣湾，
- Where can I reach you?
- I'm still in Thunder Bay...

492
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:40,150
但是上午我可以开车进城来。
but I can drive down again in the morning.

493
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:46,860
- 还有什么要补充吗？
- 没有。
- Was there something else?
- No.

494
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,480
- 谢谢你允许我放那些唱片。
- 噢，不用客气。
- Thanks for letting me play the records.
- Oh, you're very welcome.

495
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,480
非常感谢，再见。
Thanks a lot. Bye.

496
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:10,460
- 那是谁？
- 案子里的女人。
- Who's that?
- The lady in the case.

497
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:16,920
- 你不想接这个案子，哈？
- 唔，我不知道。
- You're not going to take the case?
- I don't know.

498
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:20,000
那得看明天曼尼昂会跟我说些什么。
That depends on what Manion
has to tell me tomorrow.

499
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,530
他正绞尽脑汁呢。
He's thinking things out.

500
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,690
噢，是啊，这样就对了。
Oh, well, that's more like it.

501
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,800
听着，要是我接了这个案子，
我想你也加入进来。
Now, if I take the case, 
I want you in it.

502
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,310
我？加入一起凶杀大案？
Me, in a big murder case?

503
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:37,710
噢，保利，让这样一个泡在威士忌里的
酒鬼插手案子，会毁了你的。
The sight of this whisky-drinking man 
at the lawyer's table would ruin you.

504
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,250
我需要你。
I need you.

505
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,820
你真心的吗？
You mean that?

506
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,950
他不真心就不会邀请你了。
Why else would he say it?

507
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:48,520
我很高兴在庭外和你一起工作，但是…
I'd be glad to work with you 
outside of the courtroom, but...

508
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:51,490
- 不能在法庭内。
- 随你的便。
- not in the courtroom.
- Suit yourself about that.

509
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,530
不管怎样，我都指望着依靠你了。
Either way, I'm gonna have 
to be able to depend on you.

510
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:58,470
你会把酒戒了吗？
Will you lay off the booze?

511
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:06,140
我不知道。
I don't know.

512
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,240
我不知道能否做到，保利。
I don't know about that, Paulie.

513
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,370
你为什么不知道？
Why don't you know?

514
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,480
你认为我戒不了酒？
Do you think I couldn't lay off the booze?

515
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:18,490
试过没有？
Ever tried it?

516
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,360
试试看。
Try it.

517
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:29,730
我从未接触过谋杀大案，
I never been on a big murder case.

518
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,460
这辈子没碰到过一次。
Not once in all my life.

519
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,800
全看你的了，帕内尔。
It's up to you, Parn.

520
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,950
今晚你会过来吗？
Will you be around tonight?

521
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:47,350
是的。是的，我会过来。
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be around.

522
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:59,120
你知道，梅达，亲爱的，
You know, Maida, darling...

523
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:02,170
我做得到，
I might manage it.

524
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,581
我又会成为一个货真价实的律师。
I might manage to be a real lawyer again.

525
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,200
至少先做一阵子再说。
For a little while, anyway.

526
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,410
我努力回想着，
I tried remembering.

527
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:18,280
但仍有些细节我记不起来了。
There were still some pieces missing.

528
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:21,610
我记得…
I remember...

529
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,080
我拿着枪去了奎尔的酒吧，
going to Quill's bar with a gun...

530
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:28,550
我记得吧台后面奎尔的那张脸，
and I remember Quill's face behind the bar...

531
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:33,190
但是其它的事情我就记不起来了，
甚至都不知道怎样回的家。
but I don't remember anything else, 
not even going home.

532
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:37,530
你不记得怎样开的枪吗？
打了五枪，那么大噪音可很难忘啊。
Don't you remember firing the gun?
Five shots, that's a lot of noise to forget.

533
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:41,470
是的，我记得听见了枪声，
但是那好像跟我没有关系似的。
Yeah, I remember hearing shots, 
but they don't seem connected with me.

534
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:46,600
它们听上去很遥远，
像是另外一个人开的枪。
They seemed far away, like 
somebody else was doing the shooting.

535
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:55,450
曼尼昂中尉，我决定接手你的案子。
Lt. Manion, I'll take your case.

536
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,810
噢，谢谢。谢谢你，比格勒先生。
Oh, thanks. Thanks, Mr. Biegler.

537
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,080
好的。那么现在我们来聊聊费用问题。
All right. Now, there's 
the little matter of the fee.

538
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,320
三千美元，还是相当公道的吧，是吗？
Three thousand dollars.
That's reasonable enough, isn't it?

539
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:07,020
噢，没问题，非常公道。但是我得
以后再付给你，现在我一文不名。
Oh, sure. More than reasonable. I'll 
have to pay later. Right now I'm broke.

540
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:09,720
- 你什么？
- 我身无分文，一无所有。
- You're what?
- I'm broke. I'm flat busted.

541
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:11,820
别说三千美元，就是三个美元我也拿不出来。
I don't have three dollars, much less 3,000.

542
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:16,030
- 你可以筹集一点吗？
- 噢，可以的，一旦我出了监狱。
- Can you raise it?
- Oh, yes, as soon as I get out of jail.

543
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,400
下个星期的发薪日，
But next week's payday.

544
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:22,310
我可以先付你150美元，
I'll be able to give you $150...

545
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:25,270
如果你能把我弄出去，
我会给你打个剩余款项的期票。
and if you get me off, I'll give you 
a promissory note for the rest.

546
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,050
好吧，你知道要是我先得不到
一半费用的话，我就会撒手不管了？
All right, now suppose I don't go along
with you unless you pay me half the fee?

547
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:33,220
呃，那我就去找法庭指定的律师好了。
Well, I'll have to take a lawyer the court appoints.

548
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:37,020
我有了辩护借口，对吗？精神错乱。
I got my defense now, right? Insanity.

549
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:39,820
我想我先四处想想办法，
把你保出去再说。
I think I'll stick around, 
make damn sure you get off.

550
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:43,020
- 该如何做呢？
- 我们需要个精神病专家。
- Where do we start?
- We're going to need a psychiatrist.

551
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:48,700
你我都没什么钱，
你认为军队会帮你一把吗？
Neither of us has any money. Do you 
think the army'll stir one up for you?

552
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,140
我认识个五角大楼的上校，我给他写封信。
I know a colonel in the Pentagon.
I'll write a letter.

553
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,800
很好，马上写。苏罗！
Good. Do that. Sulo.

554
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,240
你现在去哪儿？
Where are you going now?

555
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:02,750
我现在先去见你的妻子。
I'm going to see your wife, for one thing.

556
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:04,940
怎么？你昨天不是见过她了吗？
Why? Didn't you see her yesterday?

557
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:07,020
没错，见过。
That's right. I did.

558
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,280
她是个漂亮女人，你的妻子。
She's a very pretty woman, your wife.

559
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,460
时间长了当丈夫的也会熟视无睹。
A man gets used to the way his wife looks.

560
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,290
我想是的。回头见。
I guess he does. I'll see you.

561
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:27,000
“检察官”

562
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,110
请进！保利，请进来！
Come on in, Paulie. Come on in.

563
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,010
自从你从这儿搬出去以后
就没回来过，不是吗？
You haven't been in here 
since you vacated, have you?

564
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,550
老地方都认不出来了吧，嗯？
Hardly recognize the old place, huh?

565
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:43,320
玛丽帮我装修的，
她刚好学完她的室内装饰课。
Mary did it for me. She just finished 
her decorators' course.

566
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,620
聪明的姑娘，非常聪明的姑娘。
瞧瞧这个。
Smart girl. Very smart girl.
Look at this.

567
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:48,420
- 根据毕加索真迹印刷的画。
- 噢，真不错。
- A real, genuine Picasso print.
- That's very nice.

568
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:51,730
这个，试试这把椅子。
你动都不用动。
And here. Try this chair.
It sort of does things for you.

569
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:53,390
坐下去。
Sit right down.

570
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,430
感觉很棒，是吗？
他们说对神经有好处。
Great, isn't it?
Good for the nerves, they say.

571
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,870
- 怎么把它关掉？
- 这儿。
- How do you shut it off?
- Here.

572
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:01,970
起来吧。感觉爽多啦？
Here we are. Feel better?

573
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,980
感觉快被震散了。
I feel all shook up.

574
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:10,380
米奇，我来是为了跟你打个招呼，
我现在全权接手了曼尼昂的案子。
Mitch, I just dropped in to tell you
I've got both feet in the Manion case.

575
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:12,610
- 你会让他认罪宽刑，是吗？
- 不。
- You're going to cop out, aren't you?
- No.

576
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,920
那你可犯错了，保罗，
一开庭就会结案的。
That's a mistake. 
It's open and shut.

577
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,620
唔，也许吧。我们走着瞧好了。
Well, maybe. We'll see.

578
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,920
梅特兰法官还在医院里，
也许你也同意…
Judge Maitland's still in the hospital.
Maybe you'd like to agree...

579
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,050
延期开庭等他回来。
to a continuance until he gets back.

580
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,130
如果现在就审理这个案子，
上面就会胡乱指派个法官，
If we go with the case now, 
we'll have to try before...

581
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:25,460
我们就不得不由他来主持庭审。
some grab-bag judge they'll send in.

582
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,930
- 就我而言，我希望是梅特兰法官。
- 是的，我也是。
- Me, I'd rather have Maitland.
- So would I.

583
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,100
但是那也意味着在开庭之前，
我的委托人得在监狱里…
But that'd also mean my client 
would lie around in jail...

584
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:33,610
再耗上两到三个月。
for another two, three months before the trial.

585
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:37,340
因此，要是你能收回谋杀指控，
改成一般杀人指控，
Now, if you'll drop the charge 
down to manslaughter...

586
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:40,540
那么我就可以将他保释出来，
否则的话我不同意延期审理。
so I can get him out on bail,
we'll agree to a continuance.

587
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:43,010
如果你仍然是地方检察官，你不会这样做吧。
You wouldn't do that if you were still D.A.

588
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,180
我不知道，也许会。
I don't know. I might.

589
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:48,250
我会的，因为那台万能的测谎仪
对他妻子进行了测试，
I might, since a big, fat 
lie detector test on his wife...

590
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,620
结果证实了强奸的说法。
is giving proof to the rape story.

591
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:53,220
- 陪审团会站在他一边的。
- 你怎么知道测谎仪的结…
- He'd have the jury with him.
- How did you know what the lie--

592
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,030
- 你诈我的，是吗？
- 是的，你上当了。
- I bit, didn't I?
- Yeah, you did.

593
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:58,760
不管怎么说，测谎仪的测试结果
是不能作为可接受的证据的。
Anyway, the result of a lie detector 
test isn't admissible evidence.

594
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:02,360
- 你不能用它。
- 是不能用，但是它具有道德上的分量。
- You can't use it.
- No, but it carries moral weight.

595
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,030
米奇，我要是你，
我不会太喜欢坐那把椅子。
Mitch, I wouldn't sit 
in that chair too much.

596
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,230
它会把人的脑瓜颠松的。
It could shake a fellow's brains loose.

597
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,330
我们回头再见。
I'll see you later.

598
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,350
他记得你，保罗，他喜欢你。
He remembers you, Paul. He likes you.

599
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,550
他喜欢我冰箱里的啤酒。
He likes the beer in my icebox.

600
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,950
今天这身行头又有何贵干呢？
要去猎杀野牛？
What's the occasion today.
A buffalo hunt?

601
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,900
这些都是在亚利桑那时买的，
我们曾在那儿驻防。
I bought these in Arizona 
when we were stationed there.

602
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,020
穿着潇洒吗？我觉着穿着很潇洒。
Aren't they smart? I think they're very smart.

603
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:33,190
这儿，坐到我车里去。
Here, we can sit in my car.

604
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,100
给你。
Here you are.

605
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,980
到后面去，毛毛。
Here you go, Muff.

606
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,270
我又想起了几件事。
Several things have occurred to me.

607
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,480
那些，呃…
The, uh--

608
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:53,020
那些被巴尼・奎尔撕烂的内衣…
The undergarments Barney Quill tore off--

609
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,490
现在在哪儿？在警察那儿？
Who has them now? The police?

610
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,560
你是说我的内裤吗？
You mean my panties?

611
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,720
好吧。你的内裤呢？
All right. Your panties.

612
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,660
后来我也没再见到过。
I haven't seen them since.

613
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,490
我把撕烂的裙子和运动衫交给了警察，然后…
I gave the torn skirt and sweater 
to the police, and then...

614
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,230
和他们一道，回到那条深入林子的小径，
去寻找我的内裤，
I went with them up that lane into
the woods to look for the panties...

615
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,960
但是我们什么也没找到，除了我的眼镜。
but we couldn't find anything but my glasses.

616
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:13,730
你的眼镜？你是说发生这一切的时候，
你一直戴着眼镜？
Your glasses? You mean you were 
wearing glasses through all that?

617
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,470
不，眼镜在盒子里，我拿在手上。
No, I had them in a case in my hand.

618
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,380
我阅读时戴，还有玩弹球机之类的也戴着。
I wear them for reading, 
playing pinball, things like that.

619
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,910
我想是在挣扎着下车时丢掉的。
I must have tried to get 
out of the car and dropped them.

620
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:26,220
你可能有兴趣知道…
You might be interested to know...

621
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,780
你的测谎结果对你有利。
that your lie detector test 
turned out in your favor.

622
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:32,520
当然对我有利，
我早该告诉你会是这样的结果。
Of course it did.
I could've told you it would.

623
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,600
- 你一点都不担心吗？
- 不担心。
- You weren't worried about it?
- No.

624
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,930
我为什么要担心？
Why should I be?

625
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:41,470
你想不想担心什么事情呢？
Would you like to have something to worry about?

626
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:42,830
问得真可笑。
Silly.

627
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:46,070
譬如说你丈夫正透过
他牢房的窗户望着我们？
Like your husband watching us 
from his cell window?

628
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,870
好了。
All right.

629
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:53,780
好了，看到就看到了吧。
All right, let's have it.

630
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,010
- 他向你说什么了吗？
- 说了很多。
- Did he say something to you?
- Just enough.

631
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:01,020
- 你怕他吗？
- 是的。
- Are you afraid of him?
- Yes.

632
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:04,710
这就是为什么你自愿接受
测谎仪的测试吗？为了给他看？
Is that why you volunteered 
for a lie detector test? For him?

633
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:09,120
- 是的。
- 他有妒忌的理由吗？
- Yeah.
- Does he have reason to be jealous?

634
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:12,220
在我们结婚之前，他就经常妒忌。
He was jealous even before we were married.

635
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:14,800
我应该早就料到会变成这样的。
I should've known how it would be.

636
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,770
有意思的是，他还喜欢拿我炫耀。
It's funny, though. He likes to show me off.

637
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:20,100
他喜欢我打扮得漂漂亮亮。
He likes me to dress the way I do.

638
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:23,770
可是要是男人的目光都集中到我身上，
他又会变得很愤怒。
And then he gets furious 
if a man pays any attention to me.

639
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,040
我曾想过要离开他，但是我做不到。
I've tried to leave him, but I can't.

640
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,410
他一乞求，我就让步了。
He begs, I give in.

641
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:33,080
好了，如果你以为我忘了
刚才的提问，我没有忘。
Now, if you think I've forgotten 
my question, I haven't.

642
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:36,160
- 可我忘了。
- 好吧，
- I have.
- All right.

643
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,560
那我再问一遍：
Then I'll ask it again.

644
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,720
你丈夫有没有嫉妒的任何理由呢？
Does your husband have any reason to be jealous?

645
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,820
没有。
No.

646
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:47,700
一次也没有，从来没有。
Not once. Not ever.

647
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:18,730
“雷鸣湾旅店”

648
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:15,020
“巴尼・奎尔赢得
上半岛【密歇根】手枪比武赛”

649
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:01,880
“通向大厅”

650
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,770
嗨，喜欢这地方，是吗？
Hi. Like the place all right?

651
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,240
我正在看这些照片。
I was just looking at these pictures.

652
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:13,840
- 那是巴尼・奎尔，是吗？
- 是的，巴尼・奎尔。
- That was Barney Quill, wasn't it?
- That's right. Barney Quill.

653
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:16,380
- 我是保罗・比格勒，我是……
- 我知道你是谁。
- I'm Paul Biegler. I'm--
- I know who you are.

654
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,580
我在铁城见过你。
I've seen you around Iron City.

655
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:20,550
你还没告诉我你的名字。
You didn't tell me your name.

656
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:23,060
帕盖特。我们5点才开门。
Paquette. We don't open till 5:00.

657
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,680
没关系，我可以等。
That's all right. I can wait.

658
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:27,420
我还没发疟疾。
I don't have the shakes yet.

659
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:30,120
那天晚上你在这儿干活，对吗？
You were on the job that night, weren't you...

660
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:32,260
巴尼・奎尔被杀的那个晚上。
the night Barney Quill was killed.

661
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:34,660
就像报上登的那样，我在场。
Like the newspaper said, I was present.

662
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:38,170
你是那个在外面阻止曼尼昂中尉的人。
You were the fellow who stopped Lt. Manion outside.

663
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:40,170
是的。
That's right.

664
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:43,400
他用枪指着我说：
“你也想吃几颗吗，小子？”
He pointed the gun at me and said, 
"You want some too, buster?"

665
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:46,910
你回答说“不”，因为你的名字不叫“小子”。
And you said no, because your name isn't buster.

666
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:51,540
- 那有什么可笑的吗，比格勒先生？
- 不，我不是这个意思，对不起。
- Wasn't anything funny about it.
- No, there wasn't. I'm sorry.

667
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:55,110
当巴尼・奎尔被杀时，
你在哪儿，帕盖特先生？
Where were you when Barney Quill 
was killed, Mr. Paquette?

668
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,920
我想你不愿意聊那天晚上的事，是吗？
I gather you don't want 
to talk about that night, huh?

669
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:03,260
没错，我不想再谈起它。
That's right. I don't want to talk about it.

670
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,800
但是在法庭上你还是得跟我谈，
为什么不现在就谈谈呢？
You'll have to talk to me 
about it in court. Why not now?

671
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,770
因为我现在可以不谈，
这个理由够充分吗？
'Cause I don't have to now. 
Reason enough, okay?

672
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:11,900
那好吧。
Okay.

673
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:16,770
天哪，这个老巴尼看上去
像是个蛮主，是吗？
Boy, old Barney, he was kind of
a rugged character, wasn't he?

674
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:21,110
曾是职业拳击手，满身肌肉，
喜欢玩枪，还有……
Ex-prizefighter, muscle man,
fancy with guns, and--

675
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,550
他付清了债务，开了这家清白的旅店。
He paid his debts. Ran a clean place.

676
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:26,350
- 对我来说，我喜欢他。
- 这地方现在归你啦？
- Me, I liked him.
- You run the place now?

677
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:30,150
不，我只是在这儿干活。
现在由玛丽掌管。
No, I just work here.
Mary's running things.

678
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,490
玛丽？她是巴尼的妻子吗？
Mary? Was that Barney's wife?

679
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:35,620
不，他没有妻子。玛丽帮他经营。
No, he didn't have a wife. Mary was his manager.

680
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:39,670
噢，是吗。我想知道谁继承了这地方。
Oh. All right.
I wonder who's gonna inherit the place?

681
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:43,200
- 我想是玛丽吧。
- 嗯，又是玛丽。
- Mary, I guess.
- Mary again.

682
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,200
那有什么不对劲吗？
What's the matter with that?

683
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:48,330
你的意思是玛丽有什么不对劲吗？
我可不知道玛丽有什么不对劲。
You mean, what's the matter with Mary?
I don't know what's the matter with her.

684
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,540
她叫玛丽什么？
Mary what?

685
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,310
皮兰特，玛丽・皮兰特。
Pilant. Mary Pilant.

686
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:56,440
她就在后面的小间里。
我们不应该在这里聊我们的顾客。
She's in the back booth.
We don't talk about our customers here.

687
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:58,980
但是我们要聊的话，我们不聊……
But if we did--which we don't--

688
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:03,090
那就是她，她就是玛丽・皮兰特。
That's her. That's Mary Pilant.

689
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:16,700
- 你认识曼尼昂中尉的妻子吗？
- 当然认识，我也认识中尉本人。
- Do you know Lt. Manion's wife?
- Sure. I know the lieutenant too.

690
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,670
他是个好的长官，她人也不错。
He's a good officer. She's all right too.

691
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:22,040
很友善，好孩子。
Friendly. Good kid.

692
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:24,080
你知道什么？住嘴！
What do you know about it? Knock it off.

693
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:27,080
我又没说什么。她是个迷人的女子。
这样说有什么不对吗？
I didn't mean anything. She's a dish.
What's the matter with that?

694
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:30,210
你想给这位律师留下错误的印象吗？
Do you want this lawyer to get wrong ideas?

695
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,910
中尉会有多少机会呢，麦卡锡先生？
What chance has the lieutenant got, Mr. McCarthy?

696
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:38,120
我要说机会很大，如果有多几个
你这样的了解他的证人的话。
Pretty good, I'd say, with a couple 
of character witnesses like you.

697
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:41,350
我很愿意帮他，我当然愿意。
但是我们马上要搬走了。
I'd like to help him out. I sure would.
But we're moving out.

698
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,520
整个部队，去柏林。
The whole outfit. Berlin.

699
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:48,930
告诉我，那个旅店里的女孩是谁？
Tell me, who is this babe at the hotel?

700
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:53,340
她叫玛丽・皮兰特，
她是奎尔的私人财产。
Name's Mary Pilant.
She was Quill's private property.

701
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,600
- 你想要个桌子吗，先生？
- 是的。
- Would you like a table, sir?
- Yes, please.

702
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:18,480
- 你是一个人吗？
- 我在等另外两位。
- Will you be alone?
- I'll be joined by two others.

703
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:21,950
- 要把你帽子挂起来吗？
- 噢，谢谢，非常感谢。
- May I take your hat?
- Thank you very much.

704
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:33,220
- 指甲修得怎样？
- 你想要知道谁我都可以告诉你。
- How was the manicure?
- Ask me any questions about anybody.

705
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:38,300
- 我探到了所有消息。
- 那你跟我说说有个叫玛丽・皮兰特的女人吧。
- I've got all the dope.
- Can you tell me about Mary Pilant?

706
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,230
小菜一碟。玛丽・皮兰特可能是也可能不是…
Easy. Mary Pilant may or may not have been...

707
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:44,530
已故的巴尼・奎尔的情人。
the mistress of the late B. Quill.

708
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,230
指甲修剪师支持情人的说法，
The manicurist is in favor 
of the mistress theory...

709
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,210
而美发师却反对这种说法。
but the hairdresser's against it.

710
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:53,940
但是，他们都一致同意
那俩人的关系的确有点不明不白。
However, they both agree that some sort 
of hanky-panky must have been going on.

711
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,170
- 等会儿再说。
- 要菜单吗？
- To be continued.
- Menu?

712
00:47:56,270 --> 00:47:58,000
谢谢。
Thank you.

713
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,890
- 她很漂亮哈？
- 是啊，很漂亮。
- Pretty, huh?
- Yes, very pretty.

714
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,860
继续，接着说。
What? What?

715
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:06,330
唔…是这样，有一种说法是…
Anyway, there's one story that says that...

716
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,410
那一晚巴尼攻击曼尼昂夫人，
从某种意义上来说…
Barney's wild night with 
Mrs. Manion was somehow...

717
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:11,500
是由玛丽・皮兰特引起的。
triggered by Mary Pilant.

718
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:15,480
似乎她当时和一个当兵的在一起，
到处闲逛，引得巴尼怒不可遏。
Seems she'd been running around with 
some soldier, and Barney blew his stack.

719
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:18,980
- 巴尼把自己灌得烂醉，最后就爆发了。
- 玛丽・皮兰特是本地人吗？
- He got tanked up and exploded.
- Is Mary Pilant local?

720
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,420
不，她是加拿大人，巴尼带她来这儿的，
No, she's a Canadian.
Barney brought her in here...

721
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,150
可能是为了装点门面，
她留了下来接着帮他打理生意。
to sort of dress up the place, 
and she stayed on to manage it for him.

722
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:27,850
- 看起来她干得不赖。
- 岂止不赖，
- Looks like she's done all right.
- Better than all right.

723
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,690
- 旅店快是她的了。
- 哦？
- She's in for the estate.
- Oh?

724
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:33,190
她看上去不像个坏人，不是吗？
She doesn't look like a bad sort, does she?

725
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,360
嗯？哪里？
Hmm? Where?

726
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:38,770
你什么意思，“哪里”？
那个拿着菜单的美人就是。
What do you mean, "where"?
The pretty one with the menus.

727
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:40,500
就是这儿的那个姑娘吗？
This girl right here?

728
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:48,800
唔，皮兰特小姐，我可以自我介绍一下吗？
Miss Pilant, may I introduce myself?

729
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:51,140
我是保罗・比格勒，曼尼昂中尉的律师，
I'm Paul Biegler, attorney for Lt. Manion...

730
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:53,580
这位是拉特利奇小姐，
这位是麦卡锡先生，都是我的同事。
and this is Miss Rutledge 
and Mr. McCarthy, my associates.

731
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,410
- 你好！
- 我想你能不能和我们坐一分钟呢？
- How do you do.
- Could you sit with us for a minute?

732
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,550
- 好的，我可以坐一会儿。
- 谢谢。
- Yes, I can take a minute.
- Thank you.

733
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:04,190
我想向你了解一些事情，
如果你不介意的话。
I'd like to ask you a few things, 
if you don't mind.

734
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:06,490
什么样的事情，比格勒先生？
What sort of things, Mr. Biegler?

735
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,260
嗯，比如说你的雇主
奎尔先生是一个怎样的人。
Well, like what kind of a man
your employer was, Mr. Quill.

736
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:13,200
- 一个非常好的人。
- 如果那是事实的话，那你如何解释…
- A very nice man.
- If that's true, how do you explain...

737
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,570
发生在曼尼昂中尉妻子身上的事儿？
what happened with Lt. Manion's wife?

738
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:18,570
我压根不知道在曼尼昂中尉妻子身上
发生了什么事，
I don't know what happened 
with Lt. Manion's wife...

739
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,140
所以我也真的没有什么
可以解释的了，不是吗？
so there really isn't anything 
for me to explain, is there?

740
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:24,680
你对已故的奎尔先生的忠诚
非常令人动容，皮兰特小姐。
Your loyalty to the dead Mr. Quill 
is very touching, Miss Pilant.

741
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:27,180
巴尼在这儿可以说是
人见人爱，比格勒先生。
Barney was well liked here 
by everyone, Mr. Biegler.

742
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:30,620
噢，那么一定是人人都很有雅量，
可以无视他犯的小小过失，
It's very generous of everyone 
to overlook his faults...

743
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:32,720
比如说强奸他人妻子之类的事。
like raping other men's wives.

744
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,220
原谅我失陪了。
If you'll pardon me.

745
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:37,890
你们选好了的话，
服务小姐会过来听你们点菜。
The waitress will take your order 
when you're ready.

746
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,050
很高兴认识你们，比格勒先生，
Nice to have met you, Mr. Biegler...

747
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,390
麦卡锡先生，拉特利奇夫人。
Mr. McCarthy, Mrs. Rutledge.

748
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,330
你刚喝了杜松子酒，中尉。
You just drew gin, Lieutenant.

749
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:51,810
- 二十。
- 曼尼昂？
- Twenty.
- Manion?

750
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:57,810
- 有什么消息吗，中尉？
- 是的。
- Any word, Lieutenant?
- Yeah.

751
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,610
这是华盛顿来的。
This, from Washington.

752
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,520
他们同意派个医生过来替我作证，
但是有个条件：
They'll let a doctor come and testify, 
but there's a string on it.

753
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:07,720
他们想让我去底特律的
一家军队医院先做检查。
They want me to go to an army hospital
in Detroit for an examination.

754
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:11,590
他们不明白你正在监狱里吗？
而且以你的控罪不能保释？
Doesn't the army understand that you're
in jail on a non-bailable offense?

755
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:13,660
军队只能帮这么多忙了。
That's it, as far as the army's concerned.

756
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,530
我不知道该怎么做，我会想想办法的。
I don't know how I can get around this.
I'll try and think of something.

757
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:19,970
我说，我妻子已经两天没来看我了。
你见到她了吗？
Look, my wife hasn't been here 
in two days. Have you seen her?

758
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:23,300
- 没有，最近没见过。
- 她究竟去哪儿了？
- No, not for a while.
- Where the hell is she?

759
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:25,340
你还是多担心担心其它事情吧，中尉。
You've got other things to worry about, Lieutenant.

760
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,140
我会和你妻子联系，转告她你想见她。
I'll get in touch with your wife.
I'll tell her you miss her.

761
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:30,150
是的，请转告她。
Yeah, you tell her that.

762
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,080
- 谢谢，苏罗。
- 没事，保利。
- Thanks, Sulo.
- Okay, Paulie.

763
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,290
我理解你的感觉，中尉。
I know just how you feel, Lieutenant.

764
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:44,120
要是我有那样的尤物在外面的话，
我也会抓狂的。
I'd be tearing my hair out too 
if I had something like that outside.

765
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:48,030
什么样的尤物在外面？
Something like what outside?

766
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:52,660
你知道我的意思，那种放荡无羁的尤物。
You know what I mean. Something like 
that running around on the loose.

767
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:01,270
怎么啦，小子们，谁弄的动静？
Now, what's the big noise, buckos?

768
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:06,610
是我，笨伯。我的肘撞在这该死的铁杠上了。
It's me, dummy. I hit my elbow 
on this lousy iron bar.

769
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:10,590
那是不是要给你些酒精搽搽呢？
You want some rubbing alcohol maybe?

770
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:12,780
给点波旁威士忌就行了。
A little bourbon might help.

771
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:16,360
闭嘴，小子们，闭嘴！
Knock it off, buckos.

772
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:18,490
我们把牌玩完吧，中尉。
Let's finish the game, Lieutenant.

773
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:22,770
“醉眼乐队”

774
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,890
嘿，你可真是个疯狂的律师。
Hey, what a crazy lawyer we got.

775
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,260
你好，保利。他们就是这样叫你的吧？保利？
Hiya, Paulie. That's what 
they call you, isn't it? Paulie?

776
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:58,330
疯狂的律师，疯狂的名字。
That's a crazy name for a crazy lawyer.

777
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:11,570
- 谢谢你让我和你一起弹，“醉眼”。
- 嗨，你不是就想颠儿了吧？
- Thanks for letting me sit in, Pie-Eye.
- Hey, you're not splitting the scene?

778
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,980
- 我是说你想走了吗？
- 不 ，我过会儿回来。
- I mean, you're not cuttin' out?
- No, I'll be back.

779
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:37,010
嗨，保利。伙计们，这位是曼尼的律师。 
Hi, Paulie. Fellows, this is Manny's lawyer.

780
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:38,570
- 嗨，你好！
- 不想坐下吗？
- Hi. How are you?
- Sit down, won't you?

781
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:41,040
抱歉，现在不行。曼尼昂夫人，
I'm sorry, I can't right now. Mrs. Manion...

782
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:43,380
我可以到外面和你谈会儿吗？
may I talk to you for a moment outside?

783
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:47,080
曼尼昂夫人？我还以为
我们早就不用这么正式了。
Mrs. Manion? I thought we dropped 
the formalities a long time ago.

784
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:50,020
我想或许我们还是重新
变得正式一点好，这很重要。
I think maybe we'd better pick 'em 
up again. It's important.

785
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,450
- 好吧，我跟你走。
- 好吧，这边来。
- All right. I'll go with you.
- All right. Come on.

786
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,750
嘿，你还会回来，对吗？
Hey. You're coming back, aren't you?

787
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:56,760
你说呢？
What do you think?

788
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:08,330
回头见，“醉眼”。
See you later, Pie-Eye.

789
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:09,910
好的。
Okay.

790
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:21,040
- 你收到我的电话留言啦？
- 是的，但是我很忙。
- Did you get my phone message?
- Yeah, but I got busy.

791
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:23,180
为什么你没去看你丈夫？
Why haven't you been to see your husband?

792
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:25,190
不明白为什么要每天去看他。
I don't see why I have to see him every day.

793
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:27,480
我认为你每天都去是个不错的主意。
I think it would be a very good idea if you did.

794
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:29,960
好吧，我会每天去看他。行了吧？
All right, I'll see him every day. Okay?

795
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:33,050
- 不，还不行。你的车在哪儿？
- 我跟他们一起来的。
- No, not okay. Where's your car?
- I came with them.

796
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:36,220
- 我的车就在那儿，跟我来。
- 慢着，我朋友还在里面呢！
- Mine's right over here. Come on.
- Wait. I've got friends inside.

797
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:39,770
- 什么朋友不朋友的，你现在就回家去。
- 你以为你是谁？
- Friends or not, you're going home.
- Who do you think you are?

798
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:42,530
我是那位想帮你丈夫
打赢官司的律师，记起来了？
I'm the lawyer trying to beat a rap 
for your husband, remember?

799
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,770
- 那又怎么……
- 你听好了！你听好了！
- What's that got to do with--
- You listen to me.

800
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,540
在结案之前，你必须是一个温顺的小娇妻，
Until this trial's over, you're 
going to be a meek little housewife...

801
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:50,550
戴一副角质架的眼镜；
with horn-rimmed spectacles...

802
00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:53,280
你必须远离这些男人和路边酒馆，
and you're going to stay away 
from men and juke joints...

803
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:55,680
不再喝酒和玩弹球游戏；
and booze and pinball machines...

804
00:53:55,790 --> 00:53:59,750
你必须穿着裙服和低跟的鞋子，
你必须束着腰带。
and you're going to wear a skirt
and low-heeled shoes and a girdle.

805
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:02,190
特别是要束腰带。
你看，劳拉……
And especially a girdle.
Look, Laura...

806
00:54:02,290 --> 00:54:05,130
相信我，我通常并不讨厌女士们
富于魅力的摇曳身姿，
believe me, I don't usually 
complain of an attractive jiggle...

807
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:08,320
但是你最好还是将你的摇曳身姿
留给你丈夫去观赏吧，
but you save that jiggle 
for your husband to look at...

808
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:10,290
要是我能尽快把他弄出监狱的话。
if and when I get him out of jail.

809
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:12,100
行了，我们走吧。
Come on. Let's go.

810
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:17,530
我很抱歉，真的很抱歉。
再怎么样，我也不想毁掉曼尼的机会。
I'm sorry. I really am. I wouldn't 
hurt Manny's chances for anything.

811
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,540
走吧。
Come on.

812
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,010
这里是巴尼殴打你的地方吗？
Is this about where Barney knocked you down?

813
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:02,350
是的，就在这里。
Yeah, right over here.

814
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:04,610
那儿的篱笆上有道门，
毛毛咬着便携灯…
Over there's the opening in the fence 
where Muffy was running...

815
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,990
在那儿跑进跑出。
back and forth with the flashlight.

816
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:11,890
你们的车房在哪儿？
Where's your trailer?

817
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,900
在那边山上。
Up there on the hill.

818
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:22,600
这是我最喜欢的地方。
This is my favorite place.

819
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:31,070
有时我会等曼尼熟睡后
一个人走出来，就这样坐着。
Sometimes when Manny was sleeping 
I'd come out here and just sit.

820
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:35,280
我不得不从车房里出来，
我受不了被关在里面的感觉。
I had to get out of that trailer.
I couldn't stand being cooped up.

821
00:55:37,790 --> 00:55:42,520
我…我感到孤独，包罗，非常孤独。
I'm-- I'm lonely, Paul. I'm awful lonely.

822
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:46,360
要是不孤独的话我也不会
去路边酒馆了，你知道。
I wouldn't have gone to that roadhouse 
if it weren't for that, you know.

823
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:50,330
也许你应该开始准备着习惯孤独了。
Maybe you were getting in 
some good practice being lonely.

824
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:52,830
你的意思是也许曼尼出不了狱？
You mean you think maybe Manny won't get off?

825
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:55,960
那得取决于陪审团，
你永远也说不准他们会如何裁决。
That'll be up to the jury, 
and you can never tell about them.

826
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:59,100
如果他出不了狱，还有一种方式可以了结这一切。
If he didn't, it'd be one way to end it.

827
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:01,400
不，我不是这个意思。我…
No, I don't mean that.

828
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:04,970
有时我也会这样想，
但是我真的不愿意这样做。
I may think it sometimes, 
but I don't really want it.

829
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:21,630
你好，亲爱的，你想我了吗？
Hello, sweetie. Did you miss me?

830
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:23,960
当然你想我了。
Of course you missed me.

831
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,670
你想进去吗，保罗？
You wanna come in, Paul?

832
00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:31,210
如果你愿意，你可以进去，你知道。
You can if you want to, you know.

833
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:34,740
不了，谢谢，劳拉。
No thank you, Laura.

834
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:38,210
对不起，我刚才不得不扫了你的兴在那儿。
I'm sorry I had to spoil your fun 
over at that place.

835
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:41,950
晚安，劳拉。
Good night, Laura.

836
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:43,610
晚安。
Good night.

837
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:13,510
注意，注意，注意！
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.

838
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:18,610
铁峭壁县巡回法庭现在开庭。
The circuit court for the county 
of Iron Cliffs is now in session.

839
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,620
你们可以坐下。
You can be seated.

840
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:29,960
你们有些人可能不认识我，
我的名字是威弗。
For those of you I haven't met, 
my name is Weaver.

841
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:32,700
我从本州南面过来，将临时主持本庭，
I'm from downstate,
and I'm sitting temporarily...

842
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:37,140
因为你们杰出的梅特兰法官
正身患重疾有待康复。
while your good Judge Maitland
is recovering from a severe illness.

843
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:40,430
我想没有必要作宏篇大论
来介绍我的办案方式，
There's no need to dwell 
at length upon my methods.

844
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:43,240
因为所有法官都大同小异。
One judge is quite like another.

845
00:57:43,350 --> 00:57:47,080
也许细微的差别在于
他们消化力（领悟力）的强弱，
The only difference is maybe 
in the state of their digestions...

846
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:50,590
或者是不是很容易在法官席上昏昏欲睡。
or their proclivities for sleeping on the bench.

847
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:54,070
就我而言，我可以消化掉铁铸的猪。
For myself, I can digest pig iron.

848
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:56,560
当然，也许我时不时地会打个盹，
And while I might appear to doze occasionally...

849
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:59,120
但是，你们会发现我也很容易被弄醒，
you'll find that I'm easily awakened...

850
00:57:59,230 --> 00:58:02,670
特别是被一个好律师的精妙的
particularly if shaken gently by a good lawyer...

851
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:05,430
法律观点轻轻摇醒。
with a nice point of law.

852
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,800
现在我们来看一下待判决的刑事诉讼表。
We will now take up the criminal docket.

853
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:13,000
案子一：对克拉伦斯・马迪根提起的公诉――
Case number one--
The People v. Clarence Madigan--

854
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:16,050
在夜间强行侵入他人住宅。
breaking and entering in the nighttime.

855
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:19,050
被告起立上前？
Will the defendant rise and come forward?

856
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:21,050
是我，法官大人。
That's me, Your Honor.

857
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:31,620
密歇根州，铁峭壁县法庭：
State of Michigan, court of Iron Cliffs...

858
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:35,600
我，米切尔・罗德威克，地方检察官，
前来铁峭壁县法庭…
I, Mitchell Lodwick, prosecuting 
attorney, come into Iron Cliffs...

859
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:38,730
指证克拉伦斯・马迪根，
and give the court to understand
that one Clarence Madigan...

860
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:42,330
别名“一口闷”・马迪根、
别名“老烟枪”・马迪根，
alias "One-Shot" Madigan,
alias "Smoky" Madigan...

861
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:44,740
确实强行侵入了卡斯帕・卡茨的住宅，
did break and enter the dwelling house 
of Casper Katz...

862
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:47,670
并在前述的建筑物内，犯下了盗窃罪。
and did there commit the felony 
of larceny on said premises.

863
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:51,550
马迪根先生有辩护律师吗？
Does Mr. Madigan have an attorney?

864
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:55,480
噢，没有。一个人得有钱才能
买得起律师的时间啊。
No. A man's gotta have money to ask 
them fellas the time of day.

865
00:58:55,590 --> 00:58:57,490
马迪根先生，如果你没有钱，
Mr. Madigan, if you're impoverished...

866
00:58:57,590 --> 00:59:00,720
我有义务给你指派个律师。
it's my duty to appoint an attorney 
on your behalf.

867
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:02,880
我想没必要麻烦了，法官大人。
I wouldn't bother, Your Honor.

868
00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:06,290
我偷了威士忌，罪责难逃。
I stole the whisky. I'm guilty as hell.

869
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,760
是一整箱贵重的波旁威士忌，法官大人。
It was a full case of expensive bourbon, Your Honor.

870
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:10,560
你把这些威士忌卖掉了吗？
Did you sell this whisky?

871
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:12,160
噢，不，我喝掉了。
No. I drank it.

872
00:59:12,170 --> 00:59:14,070
- 都喝掉啦？
- 你不信吗，法官？
- All of it?
- You bet, Judge.

873
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:17,830
你知不知道你因犯此罪而不得不接受惩罚？
Are you aware that it will be 
necessary to punish you for this crime?

874
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,410
我罪有应得，法官大人。
It was worth it.

875
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:22,440
好吧，我接受你的服罪，马迪根先生。
Well, I'll accept your plea of guilty, Mr. Madigan.

876
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:25,270
判决会过后下达。
现在你可以回到位子上去了。
You'll be sentenced later. 
You may now return to your place.

877
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:27,180
谢谢，法官大人。
Thanks, Your Honor.

878
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,390
案子二：
Case number two--

879
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:33,890
对弗雷德里克・曼尼昂的公诉，
The People v. Frederick Manion,

880
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:36,190
罪名是――蓄意杀人。
The charge-- murder.

881
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:40,920
我是保罗・比格勒，被告律师。
我的正式材料已交法庭归档。
Paul Biegler for the defendant.
My formal appearance is already on file.

882
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:43,520
这些人当中哪一位是你的委托人呢，比格勒先生？
Which of these men is your client, Mr. Biegler?

883
00:59:43,630 --> 00:59:45,190
一个都不是。
None of them.

884
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:48,600
庭警，你能把在押人带上来吗？
Sheriff, will you produce the prisoner?

885
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:52,610
呃…我，恐怕我做不到，法官大人。
Well, I-- I'm afraid I can't do that, Your Honor.

886
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:55,680
是不是有谁可以给我解释一下，
我可没有未卜先知的本领。
Perhaps someone should explain.
I'm not clairvoyant.

887
00:59:55,780 --> 01:00:00,050
被告现在正在底特律
接受精神病医生的检查，法官大人。
The defendant is in Detroit 
being examined by a psychiatrist.

888
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:02,180
在允许被告离开他的司法属地之前，
Shouldn't the court have been consulted...

889
01:00:02,190 --> 01:00:05,220
是不是应该征得法庭的同意呢？
before the defendant 
was allowed to leave its jurisdiction?

890
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:08,250
法官大人，在这起案子里，
我们涉及到军方。
Your Honor, we're dealing 
with the army in this matter.

891
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:11,490
他们说这是唯一的时机
可以提供给我们他们的精神病专家。
This is the only crack they would 
give us at one of their psychiatrists.

892
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:16,290
法庭当时没有参与，而且情况紧急，
我们得马上带被告去见精神病医生。
The court was not present. It was urgent 
we get the defendant to a psychiatrist.

893
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,700
那么公诉人对此有什么意见呢？
What does the attorney for the people say to this?

894
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:20,530
就我所知，这没有问题。
It was done with my knowledge.

895
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:25,570
我总是听说这儿――我们美丽半岛的
上半州――是一个奇怪的地方。
I've always heard this Upper Pennisula 
of our fair state was a queer place.

896
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:29,780
如果允许被控一级谋杀罪的嫌疑犯
逍遥外出在这儿是家常便饭的话，
If it's customary here to allow a man 
charged with first degree murder...

897
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:34,510
那么我作为一个外来者，
似乎并不合适向你们指出…
to wander about at will, I don't suppose 
it behooves an outsider to point out...

898
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:38,540
没有那条法律规定
会支持这样奇怪的自由。
that the law makes no provision 
for such quaint liberalism.

899
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:43,350
法官大人，被告在随行警官的监管之下，
今天下午返回。
The defendant is in the care of a deputy
and will be returned this afternoon.

900
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:47,060
我们将在被告回来之后，正式传讯他。
We'll formally arraign the defendant on his return.

901
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:50,660
为了记录的需要，你能否给我提一下
他会以什么理由抗辩呢？
For the sake of the docket, 
can you give me a clue to his plea?

902
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:53,960
被告愿意放弃听取犯罪指控，
并对被控罪名不进行答辩。
The defendant will waive reading 
of the information and stand mute.

903
01:00:54,070 --> 01:00:56,500
以“无罪”抗辩记录在案。
A plea of "not guilty" will be entered.

904
01:00:56,610 --> 01:01:01,310
弗雷德里克・曼尼昂之案将列于
待判决的刑事诉讼表的第一例。
The case of Frederick Manion will be
placed first on the trial docket.

905
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:14,560
你能抓紧点吗，保利？
要是有人告诉那个法官…
Can you hurry it up, Paulie?
If somebody tells that judge...

906
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:18,420
在押人在火车站四处闲荡，
他会给我颜色瞧的。
the prisoner was lounging around the 
rail station, he'll give me the works.

907
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:21,430
只需个把分钟。到这边来。
This will just take a minute. Come on over here.

908
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,900
那么中尉，检查结果怎么样呢？
Well, Lieutenant, how'd things turn out?

909
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,470
- 我有临时性精神错乱。
- 他这样跟你说的？
- I was temporarily insane.
- Did he tell you that?

910
01:01:30,570 --> 01:01:33,630
是的。他说会给你写封信。
Yeah. Says he's gonna write you a letter.

911
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:36,680
我自己也记了点。
I took some notes on my own.

912
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:38,770
医生的名字是史密斯。
The doctor's name is Smith.

913
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:42,840
我希望是“安纳托利・路德维希・史密斯”，
或者是“路德维希・冯・史密斯”，
Anatole Ludwig Smith or 
Ludwig von Smith, I hope.

914
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:45,280
那样的名字容易唬住陪审团。
A name like that would impress the jury.

915
01:01:45,390 --> 01:01:48,820
可惜只是平白的“马修・史密斯”。
他说当我向奎尔开枪时，
Just plain Matthew Smith.
He said that when I shot Quill...

916
01:01:48,930 --> 01:01:53,790
- 我患有“习惯性分裂反应”症。
- “习惯性分裂反应”。
- I was suffering from "dissociative reaction".
- "dissociative reaction".

917
01:01:54,030 --> 01:01:57,160
- 听上去很不错，是吗，搭档？
- 是啊，用听得懂的英语解释一下呢？
- Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?
- What does it mean?

918
01:01:57,170 --> 01:02:01,660
意思是“我当时产生了无法抑制的
枪击奎尔的冲动。”
It means "I had an irresistible 
impulse to shoot Quill."

919
01:02:04,770 --> 01:02:06,260
这下行了，是不是？
That's okay, isn't it?

920
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:10,640
他有没有说你在枪击奎尔时，
是否丧失了分辨是非的能力？
What did he say about your knowing 
the difference between right and wrong?

921
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:14,340
我想他没有说。怎么，这很重要吗？
I don't think he said anything.
Why, is that important?

922
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:17,680
我们最好别让警官再等了。
你还是走吧。
We'd better not keep 
the sheriff waiting. You'd better go.

923
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:25,460
谢谢你，警官。
Thank you, Sheriff.

924
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:41,170
你有否听说过密歇根州的法庭
曾将“无法抑制的冲动”接受成精神错乱？
Ever heard of a Michigan court accepting
"irresistible impulse" as insanity?

925
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:44,370
没有。或许我们改成“正当防卫”更好一些。
No. Maybe we'd better switch to self-defense.

926
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:47,540
这样的话即使米奇・罗德威克
也会让我们丢尽脸面。
Even Mitch Lodwick would make 
a monkey out of us then.

927
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:50,740
- 该死的草莓苏打水。
- 要花生吗？
- Damn strawberry soda.
- Want a peanut?

928
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:51,620
不，谢谢。
No thanks.

929
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,020
嗯，明天是星期六。
Well, tomorrow's Saturday.

930
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:59,290
开庭之前我们只有一个周末了。
你想什么时候开始工作呢？
We just have a weekend before the trial.
When do you want to start working?

931
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,630
明天上午，一大早。
Tomorrow morning, early.

932
01:03:57,150 --> 01:03:59,590
- 保利。
- 嘿，听听这个，帕内尔。
- Paulie.
- Hey, listen to this, Parn.

933
01:03:59,690 --> 01:04:02,850
你先慢着。我才找到这个：
Never mind that. Just find...

934
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:08,190
对德费（62岁）的公诉案，
密歇根案宗，486页，1886年。
People v. Durfee, 62, 
Michigan, 486, Year 1886.

935
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:11,700
就是这个！我手里的《全美诉讼报告》
也有此案。听着：
That's it. I have it right here 
in the A.L.R. Listen.

936
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:14,830
“大多数州都接受‘是非判断’的测试，
尽管这并不被认为…
"The right and wrong test, 
though deemed unscientific...

937
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:16,840
是一种科学的方法，除非…”
is adhered to by most states but--"

938
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:20,030
注意这个“除非”，
“除非被控犯罪的人…
Now listen to this "but"--
"but the fact that one accused...

939
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:23,270
确实有能力知道…
of committing a crime 
may have been able to comprehend...

940
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:26,180
他的行为所导致后果的性质，
the nature and the consequences of this act...

941
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,720
即他明确知道那是错误的行为。
and to know that it was wrong.

942
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:32,580
- 然而，…”
- 可爱永恒的“然而”。
- Nevertheless--"
- Sweet enduring word "Nevertheless."

943
01:04:32,690 --> 01:04:35,920
“然而，如果那是由于某种…
"Nevertheless, if he was forced to its execution...

944
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:41,160
无力控制的冲动…无力控制的冲动
所强行导致的行为，
by an impulse-- by an impulse 
which he was powerless to control...

945
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:43,860
那么他就可以免于受到惩罚。”
he will be excused from punishment."

946
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:47,600
密歇根州最高法院确实接受过
“无法抑制的冲动”的说法。
The Michigan Supreme Court 
did accept irresistible impulse.

947
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:49,230
这就是先例。
This is precedent.

948
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:51,830
天哪，我想我们确实有了些依据。
Boy, I think we've got a hold of something here.

949
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:54,410
亲爱的1886年的老德费。
Good old Durfee, 1886.

950
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:57,280
你的苏打水怎么样？给我点纸。
How about that? Give me a pad.

951
01:04:57,380 --> 01:05:01,040
现在这草莓苏打水也开始变味了，
喝着像是真正的波旁威士忌。
This strawberry soda is beginning 
to taste like real bourbon whisky.

952
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:04,850
是啊，那也别喝醉了，
我们还有一帮子陪审团要说服呢，
Well, don't get drunk yet.
We've got to convince a jury...

953
01:05:04,850 --> 01:05:08,210
要让他们相信我们的委托人确实
产生了“无法抑制的冲动”。
that our client was irresistibly impulsed.

954
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:10,520
记住这点。
Remember that.

955
01:05:10,530 --> 01:05:14,790
陪审团的女士们和先生们，
在开始之前，
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, 
before we proceed further...

956
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:18,830
我有必要核查一下你们作为…
it will be necessary for me 
to examine you on your qualifications...

957
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:20,990
陪审员的资格。
to sit as jurors.

958
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:23,600
请记住你们都宣过誓。
Will you please remember 
that you are under oath?

959
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:26,110
你们都是合法公民吗？
Are all of you citizens?

960
01:05:26,210 --> 01:05:28,870
如果不是请举手。
Will you please raise your hand if you are not?

961
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:46,760
你们当中有治安法官或执法人员吗？
Are there any justices of the peace 
or law enforcement officers among you?

962
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:48,850
没有。
No.

963
01:05:48,970 --> 01:05:51,700
你们当中有没有人和任何执法人员…
Are any of you related by blood or marriage...

964
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:55,290
- 有血缘或婚姻上的关系？
- 没有。
- to any law enforcement officer?
- No.

965
01:05:55,870 --> 01:05:59,870
资格检查就到此了。
下面我来检查陪审团的合法性。
So much for qualifications.
I will now examine for cause.

966
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:02,210
你们当中有没有任何人
和公诉人米切尔・罗德威克…
Do any of you have any business pending...

967
01:06:02,310 --> 01:06:05,910
- 有任何未决的纠纷？
- 没有。
- with the prosecuting attorney, Mitchell Lodwick?
- No.

968
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:10,120
你们当中有没有任何人
和被告辩护律师保罗・比格勒…
Do any of you have any business 
pending with Paul Biegler...

969
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:12,810
- 有任何未决的纠纷？
- 没有。
- attorney for the defense?
- No.

970
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:15,450
你们当中有没有任何人认识被告，
Are any of you acquainted with the defendant...

971
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:17,870
- 他现在正坐在比格勒先生左边？
- 没有。
- sitting there on Mr. Biegler's left?
- No.

972
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:20,530
“这家伙是州检查总长办公室的，
我见过他的表现。千万留神！”

973
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:23,500
请被告的妻子，劳拉・曼尼昂站起来好吗？
Will Mrs. Laura Manion, 
the defendant's wife, please stand?

974
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:27,170
- 你们当中有没有任何人认识曼尼昂夫人？
- 没有。
- Do any of you know Mrs. Manion?
- No.

975
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:31,000
谢谢，曼尼昂夫人，你可以坐下了。
Thank you, Mrs. Manion. You may be seated.

976
01:06:31,510 --> 01:06:33,870
辩护律师可以对陪审团的合法性提出质询。
Counsel may challenge the jury for cause.

977
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:39,470
大人，在辩方质询之前，
我可以向法庭介绍克劳德・丹瑟吗？
Before counsel's challenge, may I 
introduce Claude Dancer to the court?

978
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:42,680
来自州府兰辛的丹瑟先生
是州检查总长助理。
Mr. Dancer is an assistant 
attorney general from Lansing.

979
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:45,580
鉴于这起案子的奇特性质，
Because of the peculiar nature of this case...

980
01:06:45,690 --> 01:06:49,420
我请求了检查总长
指派丹瑟先生参与起诉过程。
I requested the attorney general to let 
Mr. Dancer sit in with the prosecution.

981
01:06:49,530 --> 01:06:52,390
久闻你的大名，丹瑟先生。
Your reputation precedes you, Mr. Dancer.

982
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,460
你的参与是本庭的荣誉。
It's a privilege to have you in my court.

983
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:57,590
谢谢，我想对我也必有收益。
Thank you. I'm sure it'll be instructive.

984
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:00,190
陪审团当中有没有任何人和州检查总长办公室
Do any of you have any business pending...

985
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:03,500
- 有任何未决的纠纷？
- 没有。
- before the attorney general's office?
- No.

986
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:08,040
我得就我以前贬损上半州和…
I must apologize for my disparaging remarks...

987
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:10,910
这儿的习惯的评论做出道歉。
about the Upper Pennisula and its customs.

988
01:07:10,910 --> 01:07:16,420
我很少碰到谋杀案的陪审团用不到半天时间
就可以选定并宣誓就职的情况。
I've seldom seen a murder jury selected 
and sworn in less than half a day.

989
01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:19,450
你们完全赢得了我的心，先生们。
You have won my heart completely, gentlemen.

990
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:22,850
丹瑟先生，你要求休庭，
你有什么问题吗？
Mr. Dancer, you asked for the recess.
What's your problem?

991
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:25,790
我只是想提一个小小的建议。
It was a little suggestion I wanted to make.

992
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:29,460
- 愿意洗耳恭听。
- 既然辩方以精神错乱作为抗辩理由，
- By all means.
- Since the defense plea is insanity...

993
01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:31,900
控方已经雇了一个精神病医生，
the prosecution has retained a psychiatrist.

994
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,060
因为根据法律，我们有权要求
用我们自己的医生…
Under the statute, we have a right 
to petition for a mental exam...

995
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:37,160
为被告作精神检查。
of the defendant by our own doctor.

996
01:07:37,270 --> 01:07:41,300
- 你熟悉这条法律吗，比格勒先生？
- 呃…呃，知道一些吧。
- Are you familiar with that statute?
- Uh-huh. Moderately.

997
01:07:41,410 --> 01:07:44,340
我想要是为此提出正式的书面申请的话，
只会耽搁正事，
I think it would only delay things 
to file a formal petition...

998
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:49,020
因此为什么我们不可以坐在一起，
只是非正式地请求法官大人…
so why don't we informally agree 
to ask His Honor for an adjournment...

999
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:52,350
暂缓个一到两天，
好让我们的医生看一下被告。
only a day or so, and our doctor
can visit with the defendant.

1000
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:55,020
我想这样对谁都省事儿。
你认为呢，比格勒先生？
It would save everyone time.
Don't you think so?

1001
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:57,120
- 是的，我想是这样。
- 很好。
- I'm sure it will.
- Good.

1002
01:07:57,130 --> 01:08:01,390
但是假如你非要提出正式的书面申请，
Suppose you just go ahead 
and file that formal petition anyway.

1003
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:05,590
当然你现在有点晚了，是吗？
也许法官大人可以对你网开一面。
Of course, you're a little late.
Maybe His Honor will overlook that.

1004
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:10,160
那么，我就会让陪审团认为，
你其实认为我们的精神错乱辩护是有些道理的。
Then I'd like the jury to see that you 
think our insanity plea has some merit.

1005
01:08:10,270 --> 01:08:13,400
其实的确没有必要让我们的医生
为你的委托人作检查。
There really won't be any need 
for our doctor to examine your client.

1006
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:15,410
当然，我那只是想遵循通常的程序而已。
Naturally, I was only following the usual procedure.

1007
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:16,940
当然，我也会全力支持。
Naturally, I'm all for it.

1008
01:08:17,050 --> 01:08:20,170
- 那么你是否要提出书面申请呢，丹瑟先生？
- 是的，大人……
- Do you wish to file the petition?
- Yes, Your Honor--

1009
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:23,180
- 不必了。
- 噢，是的，的确没有必要了。
- That won't be necessary.
- That's right.

1010
01:08:23,290 --> 01:08:27,980
小规模战斗结束，
我们开始加入大规模的战场吧。
Skirmish over. Shall we join now 
on the field of battle?

1011
01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:35,190
奎尔的身上留有五处枪伤。
The body of Quill had sustained five gunshot wounds.

1012
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:38,270
其中一颗子弹穿透心脏。
One of the bullets had passed through the heart.

1013
01:08:38,370 --> 01:08:41,800
依我之见，他几乎即刻殒命，
Death, in my opinion, was almost instantaneous...

1014
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:44,030
由这一枪直接导致。
and was directly caused by this wound.

1015
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:47,300
拉希德医生，可以给我详尽的报告吗？
Dr. Raschid, may I have your detailed report?

1016
01:08:47,410 --> 01:08:48,570
当然。
Certainly.

1017
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:52,340
我请求这份报告作为公诉方的
一号呈堂证物，记入本案。
I ask that this report be marked 
People's Exhibit One for identification.

1018
01:08:52,450 --> 01:08:54,510
接受并记入本案。
So received and marked.

1019
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:57,710
公诉方给辩护方一份报告的副本。
The people hand the defense a copy of the report.

1020
01:08:57,820 --> 01:09:00,020
辩护人可以交叉质询了。
Counsel may cross-examine.

1021
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:03,990
拉希德医生，你的主要目的是确认死亡原因，
Dr. Raschid, your primary purpose 
was to ascertain the cause of death.

1022
01:09:04,090 --> 01:09:06,190
- 是吗？
- 是的。
- Was it not?
- Yes.

1023
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:09,460
但是我在你的这份报告里
读到你检查过死者，
And yet I read in your report here
that you checked to determine...

1024
01:09:09,570 --> 01:09:14,090
以确定他是否产生过精子。
whether spermatogenesis was occurring 
in the body of the deceased.

1025
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:15,800
反对，法官大人。
Objection.

1026
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:19,240
公诉方传唤这位证人
只是为了确认死亡原因。
The people call this witness 
only to show the cause of death.

1027
01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:21,970
法官大人，这份报告是
作为一个整体成为证物的，
Your Honor, the entire report
was offered as evidence...

1028
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:25,050
报告中包含有精子产生的内容。
and the report contains this information 
about spermatogenesis.

1029
01:09:25,150 --> 01:09:26,310
反对无效，罗德威克先生。
Overruled, Mr. Lodwick.

1030
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:28,610
证人请回答。
The witness may answer.

1031
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:31,850
是的，我为死者做了那项检查。
Yes, I made that examination on the deceased.

1032
01:09:31,950 --> 01:09:34,920
那么能不能告诉法庭你的发现呢？
And now would you tell the court your findings.

1033
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:37,960
死者死亡之前，产生过精子。
Spermatogenesis was occurring at the time of death.

1034
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:41,720
换句话说，死者生前并不是不育的，
In other words, the deceased in life was not sterile.

1035
01:09:41,830 --> 01:09:43,890
- 他可以产生后代。
- 是这样的。
- He could produce children.
- That is correct.

1036
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,940
那么医生，如果一个女人声称
她和某位男子…
Now, Doctor, if a woman says 
that she has had intercourse...

1037
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:50,530
发生过性关系，
而这名男子又被证明具有生殖能力，
with a certain man 
and the man is proved fertile...

1038
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:53,270
那么即使在这个女子的体内
没有发现性行为的证据，
even though no evidence 
is found in the woman's body...

1039
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:55,740
一个律师――就说某个公诉人吧――
could a lawyer--say a prosecuting attorney--

1040
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:59,340
他能不能以此作为这名女子撒谎的证据呢？
could he use this as evidence 
that the woman is lying?

1041
01:09:59,450 --> 01:10:03,850
法官大人，我反对这样的质问方式。
Your Honor, I object to this line of questioning.

1042
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:08,520
我们在此并不关心某男某女是否发生过关系。
We're not concerned with if there has 
been relations with a man and a woman.

1043
01:10:08,530 --> 01:10:12,120
法官大人，既然精子产生的检查已经做了，
As long as an examination 
for spermatogenesis has been made...

1044
01:10:12,230 --> 01:10:14,220
至少我们也有权知道为什么要做吧。
at least we're entitled to know why.

1045
01:10:14,330 --> 01:10:15,760
反对无效，请回答。
Overruled. You may answer.

1046
01:10:15,870 --> 01:10:18,660
是的，控方可以用那个结果，
Yes, prosecution could use that...

1047
01:10:18,770 --> 01:10:22,170
尽管那并不能确凿地证明她撒了谎。
though it certainly would not be 
conclusive that she was lying.

1048
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:23,740
为什么不能？
Why not?

1049
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:27,140
可以有多种原因导致她身上没有留下证据：
There could be several reasons 
why the test on her was negative.

1050
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:30,270
用了避孕工具，
The use of a contraceptive...

1051
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:34,150
或者可能是男方没有完成性行为。
or possibly there was no completion 
on the part of the man.

1052
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:37,780
关于尸检，有没有人要求你做检查来确定…
Now this postmortem, 
were you also asked to determine...

1053
01:10:37,890 --> 01:10:41,320
死者在他死之前不久是否达到过性高潮？
if the deceased had reached a 
sexual climax shortly before his death?

1054
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:43,950
- 没有，先生。
- 那么你能不能做这样的检查呢？
- No, sir.
- Could you have made this determination?

1055
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:45,580
噢，能的。
Oh, yes.

1056
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:48,260
所以你只被要求做那样一种检查，
So, you were only asked to make such an examination...

1057
01:10:48,270 --> 01:10:51,830
那种可能会对控方有利的检查，
而对辩方有利的检查一概不做。
that might be useful to the prosecution, 
none that might help the defense?

1058
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:53,760
我反对，法官大人。
I object, Your Honor.

1059
01:10:53,870 --> 01:10:55,600
这个问题具有挑衅性。
The question is argumentative.

1060
01:10:55,710 --> 01:11:00,110
辩方律师企图攻击公诉方代表的意图。
Counsel is trying to impugn the intent 
of the representatives of the people.

1061
01:11:00,210 --> 01:11:03,410
比格勒先生，你应该意识到
这个问题是不适当的。
Mr. Biegler, you must be aware 
that the question is improper.

1062
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:06,170
我撤回这个问题并就此道歉。
I withdraw the question and apologize.

1063
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:08,610
这个问题及回答将从法庭记录里删除，
The question and answer will be stricken...

1064
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:12,880
陪审团将忽略这个问题及其回答。
and the jury will disregard 
both the question and the answer.

1065
01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:14,220
我问完了。
That's all.

1066
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,120
我不用再质询证人了。
No redirect.

1067
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:19,390
公诉方现在传唤劳埃德・伯克。
The people now call Lloyd Burke.

1068
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:21,900
请证人举步上前。
Will the witness step forward, please?

1069
01:11:25,670 --> 01:11:29,830
陪审团怎么可能忽略已经听到的内容？
How can a jury disregard what it's already heard?

1070
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:31,840
- 他们不能，中尉。
- 你能不能在上帝面前…
- They can't, Lieutenant.
- Do you solemnly swear...

1071
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:33,930
庄严宣誓，你即将作出的证词…
the testimony you shall give shall be the truth...

1072
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:37,310
将是事实，完全是事实，
除了事实没有别的？
the whole truth and nothing 
but the truth, so help you God?

1073
01:11:37,410 --> 01:11:40,280
- 我宣誓。
- 请坐下。
- I do.
- Sit down, please.

1074
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:44,580
- 请陈述你的职业，伯克先生。
- 我是广告摄影师。
- Will you state your profession?
- I'm a commercial photographer.

1075
01:11:44,690 --> 01:11:47,160
你是不是受到警察的邀约，
Were you called upon by the police...

1076
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:50,950
在死者伯纳德・奎尔的遗体
搬离死亡现场…
to take photographs of the body 
of the deceased Bernard Quill...

1077
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:54,000
之前和之后，为他拍摄遗体照片？
before and after he was removed
from the scene of death?

1078
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:55,360
是的，先生。
Yes, sir.

1079
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:58,520
这些死者的照片是你拍的吗？
Were these photographs of the deceased made by you?

1080
01:12:02,970 --> 01:12:04,530
是的。
They were.

1081
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:09,480
书记官请记下这些照片，
作为公诉方的呈堂证物282-D。
The recorder will please mark 
these People's Exhibit 282-D.

1082
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:13,140
可将照片提交辩方检查。
Photos are tendered to the defense for examination.

1083
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:16,420
公诉方提议照片被法庭接受为证物。
请辩方询问证人。
And the people move their admission 
as evidence. Your witness.

1084
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:18,320
没有问题，没有异议。
No questions. No objections.

1085
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:21,150
保罗，那天晚上他也拍了我的照片。
Paul, he took pictures of me that night too.

1086
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:22,520
请等一下，伯克先生。
Just a minute, Mr. Burke.

1087
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:31,200
伯克先生，这些照片作为证物提交给法庭，
那么那天晚上你是否只拍了这些照片呢？
These photos offered as evidence, are
they the only ones you took that night?

1088
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:33,390
唔…呃…不。
Why, no.

1089
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:35,470
我想其它照片你洗不出来，是这样吗？
I suppose the others didn't turn out?

1090
01:12:35,570 --> 01:12:38,300
我拍的照都可以洗出来。
All my pictures turn out.

1091
01:12:38,410 --> 01:12:41,100
噢，当然。我求你原谅。
Of course. I beg your pardon.

1092
01:12:41,210 --> 01:12:44,040
那么你有没有把其它照片交给警方呢？
Did you give the other pictures to the police?

1093
01:12:44,150 --> 01:12:45,610
是的，我交了。
I did.

1094
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:47,640
那么伯克先生，那些是什么照片呢？
What were they?

1095
01:12:47,650 --> 01:12:50,850
是无关的照片吗？也许是月亮的照片？
Were they side shots or a shot of the moon perhaps...

1096
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:53,680
或者是一头黑熊在雷鸣湾的垃圾箱内的刨食照？
or a black bear scavenging the Thunder Bay dump?

1097
01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:57,620
我反对，法官大人。
我看不出其它的照片与本案有关。
I object. I can't see how 
other photographs are relevant.

1098
01:12:57,730 --> 01:13:02,630
引入照片是为了显示死者由于暴力而致死。
The photos were introduced to show 
the deceased met with a violent death.

1099
01:13:02,730 --> 01:13:06,190
法官大人，我想任何与这起案子
有联系的照片，都应该与本案有关。
I should think any photo pertaining 
to the case would be relevant.

1100
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:09,200
你说得有道理，比格勒先生，请继续。
The point is good, Mr. Biegler. Continue.

1101
01:13:09,310 --> 01:13:12,040
那些其它的照片拍的什么呢，伯克先生？
What were these other photographs of?

1102
01:13:12,940 --> 01:13:14,530
曼尼昂中尉的妻子。
Lieutenant Manion's wife.

1103
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:18,810
你是说那些照片显示了那晚
巴尼・奎尔被杀后她的样子吗？
You mean they showed how she looked
after Barney Quill was killed?

1104
01:13:18,910 --> 01:13:21,820
- 是的。
- 法官大人，她当时的样子与本案无关。
- Yes.
- How she looked is irrelevant.

1105
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:25,410
没有证据将曼尼昂夫人的样子
和这个谋杀案相联系。
There's no evidence to connect
Mrs. Manion's appearance to this murder.

1106
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,680
- 支持。
- 我很抱歉，法官大人。
- Sustained.
- I'm sorry.

1107
01:13:27,790 --> 01:13:31,160
我只是想确认一下控方没有扣留证物。
I just wanted to make sure prosecution 
wasn't withholding evidence.

1108
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:32,920
你们听听！
Now look here!

1109
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:36,400
我抗议被告律师对控方动机所作的…
I protest to the defense attorney's persistent attacks...

1110
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:38,490
持续不断的攻击。
on the motives of the prosecution.

1111
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:43,370
陪审团将忽略被告律师所说的这句话。
The jury will disregard the mark 
made by the defense attorney.

1112
01:13:43,470 --> 01:13:46,310
没有理由相信控方…
There's no reason to believe 
that the prosecution...

1113
01:13:46,410 --> 01:13:47,970
有不诚实的行为。
has not acted in good faith.

1114
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,990
那我向控方道歉，还有向法庭道歉。
My apologies to the prosecution and to the court.

1115
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:54,460
但是法官大人，既然谈到了抗议，
But Your Honor, as long as protests are being made...

1116
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:57,120
那我也想抗议一下。
I'd like to make a protest myself.

1117
01:13:57,230 --> 01:14:02,500
我完全乐意在任何时间、任何地点，
和这两位律界巨擘切磋交流，
I'm perfectly willing to take on these
two legal giants anytime, anyplace...

1118
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:05,440
但是他们得一个个来，这样才能显得公平嘛。
but in all fairness it ought to be one at a time.

1119
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:08,980
我不希望这两个家伙
同时向我投出漫无目标的乱球。
I don't want these two fellas pitching 
knuckleballs at me at the same time.

1120
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:12,480
在我看来你干得虽然不算尽善尽美，
但已相当不错了，比格勒先生，
It seems to me you're batting 
close to a thousand...

1121
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:14,980
你的意思很明确。
but your point is well taken.

1122
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:17,680
不管你们俩哪一位开始询问证人，
Whichever attorney opens with the witness...

1123
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:22,420
那么只有他一个人可以继续询问
这个证人，直到证人离席。
he alone shall continue with that 
witness until the witness is excused.

1124
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:25,050
谢谢您，法官大人。没有问题了。
Thank you, Your Honor. No more questions.

1125
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:26,960
没有问题。
No questions.

1126
01:14:37,470 --> 01:14:40,200
- 喔哦，我们进展很顺利，对吗？
- 帕内尔在哪儿？
- My, we're drawing well, aren't we?
- Where's Parnell?

1127
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:42,330
帕内尔？怎么，他不在这儿吗？
Parnell? Isn't he here?

1128
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:45,500
没有，他不在这儿，
也不在他租的房子里，整晚都不在。
No, he's not here, not in his rooming 
house and hasn't been there all night.

1129
01:14:45,610 --> 01:14:47,640
你是最后一个见到他的，他去哪儿了？
You were the last to see him. Where is he?

1130
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:51,740
- 我答应他不说的，所以你别问了。
- 他不会又开始喝上了吧？
- I promised not to tell, so don't ask.
- He hasn't fallen off the wagon?

1131
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:54,450
- 不，他没酗酒。
- 那他去哪儿了呢？
- No, he was sober.
- Has he gone somewhere?

1132
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:57,250
他的确借了我的车去干什么了。
He did borrow my car for something or other.

1133
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:00,490
你的车？那太明智了。
他有20年没开过车了，
Your car? That was smart.
He hasn't driven a car in 20 years.

1134
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,690
他会杀了他自己的。他究竟去哪儿啦？
He'll kill himself. Now where's he gone?

1135
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:05,130
我得言而有信。
My word is my bond.

1136
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:28,330
“慢行，距加拿大海关检查站半英里”

1137
01:15:30,390 --> 01:15:33,790
早上好，女士们、先生们。
可以开始了。
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. 
You may proceed.

1138
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:36,300
法官大人，
Your Honor...

1139
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:40,030
辩方注意到控方的桌旁，坐着第三个人。
the defense notices a third person 
at the prosecution's table.

1140
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:43,540
我们想知道是否法庭能透露点信息，
告诉我们他是谁，以满足我们的好奇？
We're wondering if the court shares 
our curiosity as to just who he is?

1141
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:45,540
我正准备给大家介绍。
I was about to introduce him.

1142
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:49,580
法官大人，这位先生是格雷戈里・哈考特医生。
Your Honor, this gentlemen is Dr. W. Gregory Harcourt.

1143
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:53,710
哈考特医生是公诉方为此案请的精神病医生。
Dr. Harcourt is the people's psychiatrist in this case.

1144
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:58,250
我们请求允许哈考特医生
作为一名观察员，坐在我们桌旁。
We ask that Dr. Harcourt be allowed 
to sit at our table as an observer.

1145
01:15:58,350 --> 01:16:00,080
你想让他观察什么呢？
What are you going to have him observe--

1146
01:16:00,190 --> 01:16:03,630
是金牛星座呢，还是大黄蜂的一生？
the constellation of Taurus 
or the life and times of a bumblebee?

1147
01:16:03,730 --> 01:16:06,490
当然是观察被告啦。
To observe the defendant, of course.

1148
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:09,860
噢，那没问题。辩方不反对，法官大人。
That's fine. The defense has no objection.

1149
01:16:09,970 --> 01:16:12,060
我只是想说我松了一口气，
I just wish to express my relief...

1150
01:16:12,170 --> 01:16:16,870
因为新的成员还好不是从
州府兰辛来的司法增援部队。
that the new recruit is not additional
legal reinforcements from Lansing.

1151
01:16:16,970 --> 01:16:19,300
传阿尔方斯・帕盖特出庭。
Call Alphonse Paquette.

1152
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:27,580
请举起右手。
Raise your right hand.

1153
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:30,520
你能不能在上帝面前庄严宣誓，
Do you solemnly swear the testimony 
you give in this case...

1154
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:34,150
你即将为本庭所作的证词将是事实，
完全是事实，除了事实没有别的？
shall be the whole truth and nothing 
but the truth, so help you God?

1155
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:36,160
- 我宣誓。
- 请坐下。
- I do.
- Take a seat, please.

1156
01:16:38,690 --> 01:16:42,220
- 请报上你的姓名。
- 阿尔方斯・帕盖特。
- Will you state your name?
- Alphonse Paquette.

1157
01:16:42,330 --> 01:16:46,530
- 你在“雷鸣湾旅店”工作是吗，帕盖特先生？
- 我是那里的酒吧侍者。
- You work at the Thunder Bay Inn?
- I'm bartender there.

1158
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:50,000
在巴尼・奎尔被弗雷德里克・曼尼昂
开枪打死的那个晚上，你是不是在工作？
Were you working the night that Barney 
Quill was shot by Frederick Manion?

1159
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:52,510
- 我在工作。
- 你看到开枪过程了吗？
- I was.
- Were you witness to the shooting?

1160
01:16:52,610 --> 01:16:53,840
我看到了。
I was.

1161
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:57,670
能不能请你用自己的语言，
告诉我们当时发生的情况？
Will you tell us please 
in your own words what happened?

1162
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:01,310
当曼尼昂中尉进来时，
我在靠近门口的一张桌子旁。
I was at a table by the door
when Lt. Manion came in.

1163
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:04,210
- 你当时一看到就认出那是曼尼昂中尉？
- 是的。
- Did you know Lt. Manion by sight and name?
- Yes.

1164
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,220
请继续。
Go ahead.

1165
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:10,780
他进来后朝吧台走去并开始射击。
Well, he came in and walked 
over to the bar and began to shoot.

1166
01:17:10,890 --> 01:17:13,490
他一边朝吧台走一边向巴尼开枪，
He shot Barney when he came up to the bar...

1167
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:17,460
在巴尼倒下后，他仍然向
吧台后面的巴尼不停地射击。
and when Barney fell he kept on shooting 
at Barney behind the bar.

1168
01:17:17,570 --> 01:17:19,470
然后他转过身子，走了出去。
Then he turned around and walked out.

1169
01:17:19,570 --> 01:17:23,800
在曼尼昂中尉进入酒吧时，他的举止如何？
When Lt. Manion entered the bar, 
how did he appear to you?

1170
01:17:23,910 --> 01:17:28,470
唔，他走得不急不慢，
好像是早有准备，你可以这么说。
Well, he walked slow, kind of deliberate 
I guess you could say.

1171
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:30,670
他和巴尼・奎尔说话了吗？
Did he speak to Barney Quill?

1172
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:34,040
一个字都没说，就这样走了过去，拔出了枪…
Not a word. Just walked over 
and pulled out his gun...

1173
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:35,620
“砰”。
and bang.

1174
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:38,850
- 然后他就走了出去。
- 是的。
- And then he walked out?
- Yes.

1175
01:17:38,950 --> 01:17:42,120
他走出去时，看上去怎么样？
When he walked out, how did he appear to you?

1176
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:44,720
他看上去和他进来时一样，
He seemed just like he did when he walked in--

1177
01:17:44,830 --> 01:17:47,060
好像他是个邮差，来送了一封信。
like he was the mailman delivering the mail.

1178
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:50,530
当曼尼昂中尉走出酒吧时，你做了什么？
When Lt. Manion walked out of the bar, 
what did you do?

1179
01:17:50,630 --> 01:17:53,900
唔，一切发生得太快，我想我当时懵了。
Well, it happened so fast, I guess I was stunned.

1180
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,870
- 然后我就跑出去追他。
- 你在外面看到他了吗？
- But then I ran out after him.
- Did you find him outside?

1181
01:17:56,970 --> 01:17:59,870
- 是的，先生，他正离开。
- 你和他说话了吗？
- Yes, sir. He was walking away.
- Did you speak to him?

1182
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:03,930
是的，先生。我说：“中尉，出了这样的事，
你最好还是别跑。”
Yes, sir. I said, "Lieutenant, 
you'd better not run away from this."

1183
01:18:04,050 --> 01:18:06,480
他回答你了吗？
Did he reply to you?

1184
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:10,070
他说：“你也想吃几颗吗，小子？”
He said, "Do you want some too, buster?"

1185
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:12,180
他拿枪对着你了吗？
Was he pointing the gun at you?

1186
01:18:12,290 --> 01:18:16,090
他拿枪指着我的方向，但是枪口朝着下面。
He was holding the gun in my direction, 
but the muzzle was low.

1187
01:18:16,190 --> 01:18:20,320
当他说“你也想吃几颗吗，小子？”的时候，
When he said, "Do you want some too, buster?"...

1188
01:18:20,430 --> 01:18:22,330
他的语调是怎样的？
how was that expressed?

1189
01:18:22,430 --> 01:18:25,330
他是喊出来的？歇斯底里的？
Did he shout it? Was it hysterical?

1190
01:18:25,430 --> 01:18:28,130
粗着嗓子说的？声音里有颤抖吗？
Was he hoarse? Did his voice tremble?

1191
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:32,430
没有，先生。他说的时候冷静镇定，
并直勾勾地看着我。
No, sir. He just said it 
cool and hard and looked right at me.

1192
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:35,570
就你所能判断而言，他看起来…
Did he appear to you, as far as you could tell...

1193
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:38,840
是不是完全处于清醒状态？
to be in complete possession of his faculties?

1194
01:18:38,950 --> 01:18:42,380
- 是的，先生，我是这样认为的。
- 你来质询吧。
- Yes, sir, as far as I could tell.
- Your witness.

1195
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:47,110
帕盖特先生，那天晚上你在酒吧见到过
曼尼昂夫人，也就是曼尼昂中尉的妻子吗？
Mr. Paquette, did you see Laura Manion 
in the bar that night?

1196
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:50,450
法官大人，他又来了！
这是非实质的，与本案无关。
There he goes again.
This is immaterial and irrelevant.

1197
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:54,430
法官大人，我不明白为什么控方
那么容易激动，我还没说什么呢。
I don't see why the prosecution's 
so jumpy. I haven't gone any place yet.

1198
01:18:54,530 --> 01:18:58,400
我们先看看他想说什么，
然后再来反对，罗德威克先生。
Let's see where he's going 
before we start objecting.

1199
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:00,560
你可以继续，比格勒先生。
You may proceed.

1200
01:19:00,670 --> 01:19:03,330
那天晚上你在酒吧见过曼尼昂夫人吗？
Did you see Mrs. Manion in the bar that night?

1201
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:07,310
- 她在那儿。
- 那天晚上巴尼・奎尔离开过酒吧吗？
- She was there.
- Did Barney Quill leave that night?

1202
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:09,780
- 是的。
- 你记不记得他是什么时候回来的？
- Yes.
- Do you remember when he returned?

1203
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:11,810
我想他大概半夜的时候回来的。
I think he came back around midnight.

1204
01:19:11,910 --> 01:19:15,470
那么他是从哪个入口进来的？
他是从大厅的门进来的呢？
Now from which entrance did he come?
Did he come from the lobby entrance...

1205
01:19:15,580 --> 01:19:18,180
还是从外面的门进来的？
or come from that outside entrance?

1206
01:19:18,290 --> 01:19:20,480
大厅的门进来的。
It was from the lobby.

1207
01:19:20,590 --> 01:19:23,390
- 那时他的举止如何？
- 你什么意思？
- And how did he appear to you then?
- How do you mean?

1208
01:19:23,490 --> 01:19:26,760
在控方问你有关曼尼昂中尉的举止的问题时，
You understood the prosecution well 
when he asked you that question...

1209
01:19:26,860 --> 01:19:28,760
你倒是理解得很透彻。
about Lt. Manion's appearance.

1210
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:32,200
噢，他看上去就像老巴尼，和平常一样。
Oh, well, he was just old Barney, like usual.

1211
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:37,700
你的意思是他还是那个
和蔼朴实的、温和可靠的、
You mean he was just good old 
sober, reliable, gentle...

1212
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:40,400
高尚中坚的、平易近人的老巴尼。
salt-of-the-earth, friend-to-man Barney.

1213
01:19:40,510 --> 01:19:42,640
法官大人，法官大人，这算什么问题？
Your Honor, what kind of a question is that?

1214
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:45,110
我收回我的问题好了，法官大人。
I withdraw the question, Your Honor.

1215
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:51,940
帕盖特先生，巴尼离开酒吧后，
他有没有换过衣服？
Had Barney changed his clothes 
since he left the bar?

1216
01:19:52,050 --> 01:19:53,280
我不记得了。
I don't remember.

1217
01:19:53,390 --> 01:19:56,380
也许他回来时的衣服和离开时的不一样，
Might his clothing have been different 
when he returned--

1218
01:19:56,490 --> 01:19:59,090
也就是说，他有没有可能换过衣服？
that is, might he have changed his clothes?

1219
01:19:59,190 --> 01:20:01,090
说不好，我没注意。
I didn't notice.

1220
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:03,360
那天晚上巴尼喝酒了吗？
Was Barney drinking that night?

1221
01:20:03,470 --> 01:20:07,700
他和客人聊天时总会喝上几口。
Well, he always had a few shots
while he was talking to the customers.

1222
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:11,260
- 他很友善。
- 噢，当然，可爱的老巴尼。
- He's friendly.
- Oh, sure, he was. Good old Barney.

1223
01:20:11,370 --> 01:20:15,140
那么你说可爱的老巴尼通常会喝多少酒呢？
Now how many shots would you say
good old Barney usually had?

1224
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:16,800
我不知道准确的有多少。
I don't know.

1225
01:20:16,910 --> 01:20:19,610
那晚他没有喝过头吗，帕盖特先生？
Wasn't he in fact pretty loaded that night?

1226
01:20:19,710 --> 01:20:22,770
反对，法官大人。即使死者酩酊大醉，
Objection. Even if the deceased was dead drunk...

1227
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:24,780
也不能作为被控罪名的辩护理由。
it's no defense to this charge.

1228
01:20:24,890 --> 01:20:28,820
反对有效。我建议你停止这方面问题，比格勒先生。
Sustained. I suggest you get off this.

1229
01:20:28,830 --> 01:20:33,830
帕盖特先生，你怎么称呼一个
对女性有着贪得无厌兴趣的男人？
What would you call a man with 
an insatiable penchant for women?

1230
01:20:33,930 --> 01:20:35,620
一个什么？
A what?

1231
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:39,390
兴趣、欲望、喜好、热情。
A penchant, a desire, taste, passion.

1232
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:42,600
呃，花花公子，我想是。
Well, a ladies man, I guess.

1233
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:44,930
或者叫大白痴更合适。
Or maybe just a damn fool.

1234
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:49,370
你只要回答问题就行了，帕盖特先生。
Just answer the questions.

1235
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:52,240
俏皮话留给律师们去说好了。
The attorneys will provide the wisecracks.

1236
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:56,180
哈，对那样的男人你还有什么
其它的叫法吗，帕盖特先生？
Well, what else would you 
call a man like that?

1237
01:20:56,280 --> 01:21:00,550
- 我们不明白这样问话的目的是什么。
- 我看你明白得很，罗德威克先生。
- We can't see the drift of this.
- You mean you do see.

1238
01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:01,820
你可以回答。
You may answer.

1239
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,320
你能想起其它的名字吗，帕盖特先生？
Can you think of another name?

1240
01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:06,120
浪荡公子。
Woman chaser.

1241
01:21:06,230 --> 01:21:08,820
- 还有呢？
- 情圣？
- Try again.
- Masher?

1242
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:10,860
噢，算了吧，帕盖特先生。
Oh, come now.

1243
01:21:10,970 --> 01:21:14,400
情圣追逐的是穿着鲸须束胸、
头戴发网的女人。
Mashers went out with 
whalebone corsets and hairnets.

1244
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:16,400
你没听说过“色狼”的说法吗？
Did you ever hear the expression "wolf"?

1245
01:21:16,510 --> 01:21:19,200
当然，我听说过，只是一时没想到而已。
Sure, I heard that. It just slipped my mind.

1246
01:21:19,310 --> 01:21:21,400
“一时没想到而已”，当然你会记不起来了，
Well, naturally, it would...

1247
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:24,640
有那些老掉牙的“情圣”这样的词
在你脑子里哐当乱响。
clanking around in there with all those 
rusty old "mashers."

1248
01:21:24,650 --> 01:21:27,880
你认识的人当中有没有
可以被称为色狼的呢，帕盖特先生？
Have you ever known a man 
you could call a wolf?

1249
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:30,950
- 我不确定。
- 巴尼・奎尔是色狼吗，帕盖特先生？
- I'm not sure.
- Was Barney Quill a wolf?

1250
01:21:31,050 --> 01:21:32,610
- 我说不好。
- 还是不愿意说？
- I couldn't say.
- Or wouldn't?

1251
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:34,620
- 反对！
- 反对有效。
- Objection.
- Sustained.

1252
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:38,160
他已经回答了你的问题，
他说他说不好。
The question was answered.
He said he couldn't tell you.

1253
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:43,220
帕盖特先生，当巴尼从不知道哪边回来后，
Mr. Paquette, when Barney returned
from wherever he had gone...

1254
01:21:43,330 --> 01:21:45,700
- 他有没有让你离开吧台的工作？
- 是的。
- did he relieve you at the bar?
- Yes.

1255
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:48,960
- 他怎么对你说的？
- 他说：“交给我吧。”
- And what did he say then?
- He said, "I'll take over."

1256
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:52,510
你从吧台后面出来后，你去哪儿啦？
When you came out from behind the bar, 
where did you go?

1257
01:21:52,610 --> 01:21:55,370
我去了彼德森夫妇坐着的桌子。
I went over to the table 
where the Pedersons were sitting.

1258
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:59,440
你作证说曼尼昂中尉进来时，你在门边上。
Now you testified that you were 
by the door when Lt. Manion came in.

1259
01:21:59,550 --> 01:22:02,520
你在门边的原因是不是因为
彼德森夫妇的桌子在那儿？
Is that the reason you were by the door, 
because the Pedersons' table was there?

1260
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:04,050
是的。
Yes.

1261
01:22:04,150 --> 01:22:07,750
在曼尼昂中尉进来之前，你在那儿多长时间？
And how long was it before Lt. Manion came in?

1262
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:10,950
我不知道确切长短，大概30分钟吧。
I don't know exactly. Maybe 30 minutes.

1263
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:13,720
在那段时间里，你一直呆在
彼德森夫妇的桌旁？
And you remained at the Pedersons' 
table all that time?

1264
01:22:13,830 --> 01:22:18,200
- 是的，他们是我的朋友。
- 在那桌子旁边有窗子吗？
- Yes, they're friends of mine.
- Is there a window beside that table?

1265
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:20,270
- 我想有。
- 你想有。
- I think so.
- You think so.

1266
01:22:20,370 --> 01:22:23,530
你在“雷鸣湾旅店”工作
多长时间了，帕盖特先生？
How long have you worked 
at the Thunder Bay Inn?

1267
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:25,400
大概六七年了吧。
About six, seven years.

1268
01:22:25,510 --> 01:22:27,670
桌旁的这扇窗户会不会…
Does this window beside the table...

1269
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:33,340
突然消失和出现，像个幽灵似地游移不定？
suddenly vanish and reappear and
come and go in a ghostly fashion?

1270
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:35,210
它一直在那儿。
It's there all the time.

1271
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:39,380
当你在那儿和朋友聊天时，
你有没有朝窗外看？
While you were talking to your friends there, 
did you look out of the window?

1272
01:22:39,490 --> 01:22:43,220
- 可能看过。
- 当你朝窗外看时，你有没有刻意想看到什么东西？
- I might have.
- Were you looking for something special?

1273
01:22:43,330 --> 01:22:45,350
没有，我没有刻意想看到什么东西。
No, I wasn't looking for anything.

1274
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:49,920
巴尼・奎尔没有让你到窗边留意曼尼昂中尉？
Didn't Barney Quill tell you to go to 
that window and look out for Lt. Manion?

1275
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:56,330
他有没有让你注意曼尼昂中尉？
Did he tell you to look out for Lt. Manion?

1276
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:59,500
他没有这么说。
He did not.

1277
01:22:59,610 --> 01:23:03,440
帕盖特先生，巴尼是个神枪手，是吗？
打枪很厉害。
Barney was quite a marksmen, 
wasn't he, with guns?

1278
01:23:03,550 --> 01:23:07,080
- 他赢过好多射击奖，是吗？
- 是的。
- He won a lot of prizes?
- Yes.

1279
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:09,980
他在吧台后面放有枪吗？
Did he keep any guns behind the bar?

1280
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:17,320
可能有吧。
He might have.

1281
01:23:17,330 --> 01:23:21,430
在吧台下面，有三个藏手枪的架子，
这是事实吗，帕盖特先生？
Isn't it a fact there are three 
concealed pistol racks behind the bar?

1282
01:23:21,430 --> 01:23:25,260
法官大人，被告的抗辩理由是
精神错乱，而非正当防卫。
The defendant's plea is one of insanity, 
not self-defense.

1283
01:23:25,370 --> 01:23:29,200
我确信比格勒先生没有忘记这一点，罗德威克先生。
I'm sure Mr. Biegler hasn't forgotten
that fact, Mr. Lodwick.

1284
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:30,770
你可以回答。
You may answer.

1285
01:23:30,870 --> 01:23:33,170
在吧台下面，有没有藏着枪架？
Are there concealed gun racks behind the bar?

1286
01:23:33,270 --> 01:23:34,500
有。
Yes.

1287
01:23:34,610 --> 01:23:37,770
那么有多少人知道有这些枪架？
And how many people know about these gun racks?

1288
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:40,140
- 我说不准。
- 那么巴尼有没有…
- I couldn't say.
- Isn't it a fact...

1289
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:44,410
偶尔会从这些架子里取出手枪
在手指上转着圈玩儿，
that Barney would take the guns out
of the racks and twirl them...

1290
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:48,220
以向他的客人们展示他的技巧？
to demonstrate his skill to the patrons?

1291
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:50,260
- 我不记得了。
- 噢，得了吧，
- I don't remember.
- Come on.

1292
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:53,620
努力想想！你自己没有看到他玩过吗？
Try and remember. 
Did you ever see him do that yourself?

1293
01:23:53,730 --> 01:23:57,100
- 看他玩过一两次吧。
- 行了，帕盖特先生。
- Once or twice he did.
- That's all.

1294
01:23:57,200 --> 01:24:00,260
- 没有其它问题了。
- 证人可以退下了。
- No further questions.
- The witness may step down.

1295
01:24:00,370 --> 01:24:02,600
传唤乔治・莱蒙。
Call George Lemon.

1296
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:10,970
比格勒现在四处出击。
Biegler's going off in all directions.

1297
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:13,310
他究竟想干什么？
What's he getting at?

1298
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:19,720
我的感觉是他在担心我们要干的。
I have a feeling he's afraid 
of what we'll get at.

1299
01:24:19,820 --> 01:24:22,690
比格勒先生出于某种原因，正制造烟幕。
Mr. Biegler's putting up 
a smoke screen for some reason.

1300
01:24:22,790 --> 01:24:25,520
- 我宣誓。
- 请坐下。
- I do.
- Take a seat please.

1301
01:24:27,030 --> 01:24:30,460
- 请报上你的姓名。
- 乔治・莱蒙。
- Will you state your name, please?
- George Lemon.

1302
01:24:30,570 --> 01:24:32,470
你做什么工作，莱蒙先生？
What kind of work do you do?

1303
01:24:32,570 --> 01:24:35,700
我是雷鸣湾旅游公园的管理员。
I'm caretaker of the tourist park in Thunder Bay.

1304
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:37,830
我负责那个地方的整洁和秩序。
I see the place is clean and orderly.

1305
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:40,370
我看着他们进进出出，
并在夜里锁好大门。
I check people in and out 
and lock the gate at night.

1306
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:43,740
你向谁负责这份工作呢？
And what is your authority for these duties?

1307
01:24:43,850 --> 01:24:47,610
我受雇于马斯顿镇区，
我还是代理治安官，
I'm paid by Madison Township 
and I'm also a deputy sheriff.

1308
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:49,150
某种荣誉性质的。
Just courtesy, sort of.

1309
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:52,950
15日夜晚你有没有见过曼尼昂中尉？
Did you see Lt. Manion on the night of the 15th?

1310
01:24:52,950 --> 01:24:55,620
- 就是巴尼・奎尔被杀的那个晚上？
- 见过，先生。
- The night Barney Quill was killed?
- Yes, sir.

1311
01:24:56,660 --> 01:25:01,120
你能不能告诉法庭你是怎样以及何时…
Will you tell the court about how and when...

1312
01:25:01,230 --> 01:25:03,660
见到曼尼昂中尉的？
you saw Lt. Manion.

1313
01:25:03,770 --> 01:25:06,860
大约凌晨1点的时候我被一阵敲门声闹醒。
About 1:00 a.m. a knock on my door waked me up.

1314
01:25:06,970 --> 01:25:09,530
我打开门看见曼尼昂中尉站在那儿。
I went to the door and Lt. Manion was standing there.

1315
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:14,440
他说：“你最好把我抓起来，莱蒙先生，
因为我刚杀了巴尼・奎尔。”
He said, "You better take me, Mr. Lemon, 
because I just shot Barney Quill."

1316
01:25:14,540 --> 01:25:17,740
我告诉他先回他的车房里，
我会给州警打电话。
I told him to go back to his trailer 
and that I would call the state police.

1317
01:25:17,850 --> 01:25:21,710
当曼尼昂中尉让你抓他的时候，
在你看来他的举止如何？
How did Lt. Manion appear to you 
when he asked you to take him?

1318
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:25,410
他说了他想说的，然后他按我说的做了，
没有惊慌失措的样子。
He said what he had to say 
and did what I told him. No fuss.

1319
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:29,010
就你所能判断而言，他看起来是不是…
Did he appear to you to be--
as far as you could tell--

1320
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:31,350
完全处于清醒状态？
in complete possession of his faculties?

1321
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:33,590
在我看来，是的，先生。
As far as I could tell, yes, sir.

1322
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:37,260
轮到你了。
Take the witness.

1323
01:25:37,370 --> 01:25:40,730
莱蒙先生，你到曼尼昂的车房去了吗？
Mr. Lemon, did you go to the Manions' trailer?

1324
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:43,800
- 是的，先生。
- 你在车房见到曼尼昂夫人了吗？
- Yes, sir.
- Did you see Mrs. Manion at the trailer?

1325
01:25:43,910 --> 01:25:47,400
- 是的，先生。
- 她看上去怎么样？
- Yes, sir.
- What was her appearance?

1326
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:49,740
她当时一团糟。
She was a mess.

1327
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:51,070
反对。
Objection.

1328
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:55,380
没有证据显示曼尼昂夫人的样子和本案有关。
No evidence has been introduced to make 
Mrs. Manion's appearance relevant.

1329
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:59,040
也没有证据显示巴尼・奎尔的样子和本案有关，
No evidence has been introduced to make 
Barney Quill's appearance relevant...

1330
01:25:59,150 --> 01:26:01,380
但那时你倒不反对对此提问。
but you didn't object to the question then.

1331
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:04,930
是否那是因为你知道巴尼・奎尔
在强奸和殴打了…
Is that because you know Barney Quill 
bathed and changed...

1332
01:26:05,030 --> 01:26:07,820
这位可怜的女士之后，
洗了澡换了衣服？
after he raped and beat hell
out of this poor woman?

1333
01:26:07,930 --> 01:26:11,300
法官大人，在这个法庭上，似乎人人
都受到了审判，除了曼尼昂先生。我必须抗议……
Your Honor, everybody in this court
is being tried except Mr. Manion.

1334
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:16,230
你给我听好了，这是对一起谋杀案进行的
交叉质询，而不是一场高中生之间的辩论！
Now listen, this is a cross-examination
murder case, not a high school debate!

1335
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:20,500
你和丹瑟想干什么？轻率地将这个士兵
送入大牢你们就满意啦？
What are you trying to do, 
railroad this soldier into the clink?

1336
01:26:20,510 --> 01:26:22,740
比格勒先生，你是个有资历的律师，
Mr. Biegler, you are an experienced attorney...

1337
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:25,570
你不应该有这样失控的发作。
and you know better than to make such an outburst.

1338
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:28,870
我不会容忍这样的放纵。
I will not tolerate intemperance of this sort.

1339
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:31,910
如果你再一次试探本庭的忍耐度，
If you once again try the patience of this court...

1340
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:34,360
我会判你藐视法庭。
I shall hold you in contempt.

1341
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:37,520
对不起，
Sorry.

1342
01:26:37,630 --> 01:26:39,720
法官大人，
Your Honor...

1343
01:26:39,830 --> 01:26:43,260
我向您道歉，不会再发生了。
I apologize and it won't happen again.

1344
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:45,390
从记录中删除证人的回答，
The witness's answer will be stricken...

1345
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:48,370
陪审团不要考虑他的回答。
and the jury will disregard the answer.

1346
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:51,230
你可以继续了，比格勒先生。
Now you may proceed, Mr. Biegler.

1347
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:52,310
好的，先生。
Yes, sir.

1348
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:58,910
莱蒙先生，那天晚上曼尼昂中尉
将你弄醒并自首之前，
On the night when Lt. Manion 
awakened you and turned himself in...

1349
01:26:58,910 --> 01:27:03,080
你有没有被其它动静吵醒过――
有没有其它事情打搅过你的睡梦？
had you been awakened before-- had
anything else disturbed your slumbers?

1350
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:05,550
- 没有，先生。
- 士兵们没有唱歌？
- No, sir.
- There were no soldiers singing?

1351
01:27:05,650 --> 01:27:08,210
没有，先生。10点后公园里没有人唱歌。
No, sir. Not in my park after 10:00.

1352
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:12,560
- 也没有女人的叫声。
- 嗯，有叫声从大门方向传过来。
- There were no women screaming?
- Those screams were down by the gate.

1353
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,190
反对！反对！
Objection!

1354
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:17,200
我看不出现在有何反对的理由，罗德威克先生。
I see no reason for objecting yet.

1355
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:20,390
跟我们说说那些叫声吧，莱蒙先生。
Tell us about those screams.

1356
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:23,990
我自己并没听到。
公园里有几个俄亥俄来的旅游者，
I didn't hear them myself. There were 
tourists from Ohio in the park...

1357
01:27:24,110 --> 01:27:26,570
他们听到了喊叫，第二天告诉我的。
and they heard them and told me 
about it the next day.

1358
01:27:26,670 --> 01:27:29,580
- 现在轮到你了，罗德威克先生。
- 这一证词无法律资格，
- Now, Mr. Lodwick.
- This testimony is incompetent...

1359
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:33,740
是与本案无关的道听途说，
是非实质性的、非决定性的……
hearsay, irrelevant, immaterial, inconclusive--

1360
01:27:33,850 --> 01:27:37,880
我可受够了。证人交给你吧，罗德威克先生。
Well, that's too much for me.
The witness is yours, Mr. Lodwick.

1361
01:27:37,890 --> 01:27:40,010
嗯？噢…呃…
Huh?

1362
01:27:40,020 --> 01:27:42,080
我没问题了。
No questions.

1363
01:27:42,190 --> 01:27:44,250
证人可以退席了。
The witness may step down.

1364
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:46,160
传唤你的下一个证人。
Call your next witness.

1365
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:50,490
詹姆士・德构警探。
Detective Sergeant James Durgo.

1366
01:27:52,270 --> 01:27:54,830
- 嗨，保利。
- 嗨，詹姆士。过来。
- Hi, Paulie.
- Hi, Jim. Come here.

1367
01:27:56,540 --> 01:27:59,470
庭审一休息，你就打电话给
那位军队里的精神病医生，
As soon as we break, you'd better phone 
that army psychiatrist.

1368
01:27:59,570 --> 01:28:02,270
- 告诉他后天到达这儿。
- 行。
- Tell him to be here day after tomorrow.
- Will do.

1369
01:28:02,380 --> 01:28:05,740
你能不能告诉我帕内尔去哪儿啦？
Will you please tell me where Parnell has gone?

1370
01:28:05,850 --> 01:28:07,780
不行。
Won't do.

1371
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:10,180
那么你被解雇了。
Well, you're fired.

1372
01:28:10,290 --> 01:28:12,950
在你没付我薪水之前，你不能解雇我。
You can't fire me till you pay me.

1373
01:28:13,050 --> 01:28:15,280
…州警警探，詹姆士・德构。
Detective Sergeant James Durgo of the state police.

1374
01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:18,620
在巴尼・奎尔被杀的那个晚上，
你是否接到雷鸣湾的代理治安官…
Were you called to Thunder Bay by 
Deputy Sheriff Lemon of Thunder Bay...

1375
01:28:18,730 --> 01:28:20,660
莱蒙的电话，让你去雷鸣湾？
on the night Barney Quill was killed?

1376
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:24,530
是的，先生。我和我的搭档一起，
第一个赶到那儿。
Yes, sir. My companion officer and I
were the first to be called in.

1377
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:28,300
德构警探，当你们赶到曼尼昂的
车房时，谁在那儿？
When you arrived at the Manion 
trailer, who was there?

1378
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,630
曼尼昂中尉和他的妻子在那里。
Lt. Manion and his wife were there.

1379
01:28:30,740 --> 01:28:33,970
曼尼昂中尉对你说了些什么？
What did Lt. Manion say to you?

1380
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:37,340
他说他妻子和巴尼・奎尔有了点麻烦。
He said that his wife had had 
some trouble with Barney Quill.

1381
01:28:37,450 --> 01:28:40,210
他去酒店向奎尔开了枪。
He had gone to the tavern and shot Quill.

1382
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:43,610
他问我们奎尔是否还活着。
我们告诉他他已经死了。
He asked us whether Quill was dead 
or not. We told him he was.

1383
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:46,650
曼尼昂中尉听到这一消息后有什么反应？
How did Lt. Manion take this information?

1384
01:28:46,750 --> 01:28:48,520
他看上去并不吃惊。
He didn't seem surprised.

1385
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:50,520
然后你们干了什么，德构警探？
What did you do then?

1386
01:28:50,630 --> 01:28:52,530
我问他要他用过的枪。
I asked for the gun he'd used.

1387
01:28:52,630 --> 01:28:56,720
那晚你有没有将曼尼昂中尉
带到这儿的铁城县监狱？
Did you take Lt. Manion to the county 
jail here in Iron City that same night?

1388
01:28:56,830 --> 01:28:59,530
是的，先生。我们和他妻子一起，
驾车将中尉带到这里。
Yes, sir. We drove the Lieutenant 
down with his wife.

1389
01:28:59,630 --> 01:29:04,730
在通往铁城的路上，
中尉有没有进一步说他开枪的事？
On the drive to Iron City, did Manion 
talk further about the shooting?

1390
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:08,400
他说如果有机会让他重新选择的话，
他仍然会这么做。
He remarked that if he had the whole 
thing to do over, he'd still do it.

1391
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:12,170
在所有这期间――在车房里，
在驱车来铁城的路上，
During all this, at the trailer, 
the drive to Iron City...

1392
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:14,180
曼尼昂中尉看上去怎么样？
how did Lt. Manion appear to you?

1393
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:18,980
他大部分时间都很沉默，
看上去头脑也很清楚。
He was very quiet most of the time.
Seemed clearheaded.

1394
01:29:19,090 --> 01:29:23,290
你是不是说他完全处于清醒状态？
Would you say he was in complete
possession of his faculties?

1395
01:29:23,390 --> 01:29:25,990
- 在我看来是这样。
- 你来问证人。
- Seemed so to me.
- Your witness.

1396
01:29:26,090 --> 01:29:29,890
德构警官，你作证说曼尼昂中尉跟你说…
Sergeant Durgo, you testified 
that Lt. Manion told you...

1397
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:35,300
在他得知他妻子和奎尔有了点麻烦后
他开枪打的巴尼・奎尔。
he shot Barney Quill after he learned 
his wife had some trouble with Quill.

1398
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:38,840
曼尼昂中尉用的是“有了点麻烦”这些词吗？
Were these the words Lt. Manion used, "some trouble"?

1399
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:41,270
不，先生，这些是我的话，不是他的用词。
No, sir. Those were my words, not his.

1400
01:29:41,380 --> 01:29:44,370
那么这是你自己的主意吗，
到这里来用你自己的词？
And was it your notion to come here 
and use your own words?

1401
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:46,140
不，先生，不是的。
No, sir.

1402
01:29:46,250 --> 01:29:48,550
那么是不是此法庭在座的某位…
And was the suggestion to call it "some trouble"...

1403
01:29:48,650 --> 01:29:51,580
建议你这样说的呢，“有了点麻烦”？
made by somebody here in the courtroom?

1404
01:29:53,390 --> 01:29:54,510
是的，先生，是这样的。
Yes, sir.

1405
01:29:55,890 --> 01:30:00,620
好的，警官，你能不能告诉法庭，
在描述他妻子所碰到的麻烦时，
Sergeant, would you tell the court 
what words Lt. Manion actually used...

1406
01:30:00,730 --> 01:30:03,030
曼尼昂中尉实际上是怎么说的？
to describe the trouble his wife had had?

1407
01:30:03,130 --> 01:30:05,730
反对，法官大人。他又来了不是。
Objection. We've been over this before.

1408
01:30:05,830 --> 01:30:08,960
这个问题和本庭所讨论的任何论点无关。
This information would not be relevant 
to any issues before the court.

1409
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:11,660
我的“有了点麻烦”的问题是由…
This statement concerning some trouble 
was brought out...

1410
01:30:11,770 --> 01:30:14,640
你对控方证人德构警官的初度询问而引起的。
during the direct examination of Sergeant Durgo.

1411
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:17,940
到现在为止，只要和劳拉・曼尼昂有关的证词，
Up to now, you've adroitly restricted all testimony...

1412
01:30:18,050 --> 01:30:20,140
你都敏捷地进行限制。
as far as Laura Manion's concerned.

1413
01:30:20,250 --> 01:30:23,550
很好，猫腻开始藏不住了，
那就让我们彻底揭开来看看好了。
All right, the cat's out of the bag.
It's fair game for me to chase it.

1414
01:30:23,650 --> 01:30:27,110
这种说法很令人不快，比格勒先生，
不要太过分了。
This is a sore point, Mr. Biegler,
and it's getting sorer.

1415
01:30:27,220 --> 01:30:29,420
我想听听控方的意见。
I'd like to hear from the prosecution.

1416
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:34,020
辩方的任务是证明被告开枪时的“临时性精神错乱”。
Burden is on defense to prove temporary 
insanity at the time of the shooting.

1417
01:30:34,130 --> 01:30:38,060
因此，如果导致辩方声称的精神错乱的原因
是本案的关键所在的话，
Now, if the reason for the alleged
insanity is important to this case...

1418
01:30:38,170 --> 01:30:40,690
那么应该把这个关键问题交给一个能胜任的证人――
then that is a matter for a competent witness--

1419
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:44,430
一个人类精神方面问题的专家――来处理。
an expert on the subject of the human mind.

1420
01:30:44,540 --> 01:30:47,200
而辩方一直在做的却是…
What the defense is trying to do...

1421
01:30:47,310 --> 01:30:50,000
引入一些耸人听闻的材料，
is introduce some sensational material...

1422
01:30:50,110 --> 01:30:53,650
其目的就是为了隐匿真正的问题。
for the purposes of obscuring the real issues.

1423
01:30:53,650 --> 01:30:58,650
法官大人，要是陪审团不先搞清楚
这整个审判背后的原因――
How can the jury accurately estimate 
the testimony being given here...

1424
01:30:58,650 --> 01:31:00,000
曼尼昂中尉为什么要杀死巴尼・奎尔，
那么他们怎么能准确判断…
unless they first know the reason 
behind this whole trial--

1425
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,870
在这里给出的这些证词呢？
why Lt. Manion shot Barney Quill?

1426
01:31:02,870 --> 01:31:06,830
而控方却试图将动机和行为分离。
The prosecution would like to separate
the motive from the act.

1427
01:31:06,940 --> 01:31:11,940
这就像是要把一个苹果的核心取出来，
却不想破坏苹果的表皮。
That's like trying to take the core 
from an apple without breaking the skin.

1428
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:16,990
而我们辩护的核心就是：
被告的“临时性精神错乱”，
Now the core of our defense is that 
the defendant's temporary insanity...

1429
01:31:17,090 --> 01:31:20,450
是由所谓的和奎尔“有了点麻烦”所导致的。
was triggered by the so-called trouble with Quill.

1430
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:22,680
因此我请求法庭…
And I beg the court--

1431
01:31:22,790 --> 01:31:28,090
我…我请求法庭，允许我把这个苹果切了进去。
I-- I beg the court to let me cut into the apple.

1432
01:31:29,030 --> 01:31:32,860
我仍然坚持我们的反对，法官大人。
Our objection still stands, Your Honor.

1433
01:31:46,150 --> 01:31:48,380
反对无效。
Objection overruled.

1434
01:31:54,660 --> 01:31:57,960
德构警官，请告诉法庭…
Sergeant Durgo, tell the court...

1435
01:31:58,060 --> 01:32:02,050
曼尼昂中尉是如何描述
他妻子和奎尔的麻烦的。
how Lt. Manion described 
the trouble his wife had with Quill.

1436
01:32:02,170 --> 01:32:05,600
他告诉我们奎尔强奸了他的妻子。
He told us that Quill had raped his wife.

1437
01:32:05,700 --> 01:32:10,700
那么你能不能大概回忆一下，关于强奸
曼尼昂中尉说了些什么？
Now, can you recall generally what 
Lt. Manion told you about this rape?

1438
01:32:10,810 --> 01:32:14,940
好的，先生。他说他一吃完饭就去睡了。
Yes, sir. He said he'd been asleep 
right after dinner.

1439
01:32:15,050 --> 01:32:19,110
他被一阵喧闹吵醒――是叫喊声，他认为。
He was waked up by some noise--
screams he thought.

1440
01:32:19,220 --> 01:32:23,210
他起床打开了车房门，走了出去。
He got up, opened the trailer door 
and went outside.

1441
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:26,350
他妻子从黑暗里跑了出来，倒在他的手臂里。
His wife came running out of the dark 
and fell into his arms.

1442
01:32:26,460 --> 01:32:29,720
你在车房见到他妻子时，她看上去怎样？
As you saw his wife in the trailer, 
how did she look?

1443
01:32:29,830 --> 01:32:32,920
她有点歇斯底里，她被打得很厉害。
She was a little hysterical.
She'd been pretty badly beaten up.

1444
01:32:33,030 --> 01:32:35,930
她的脸和双臂有大块乌青的瘀伤。
She had big black bruises 
all over her face and arms.

1445
01:32:36,030 --> 01:32:39,200
曼尼昂夫人告诉你强奸和殴打的情况了吗？
Did Mrs. Manion tell you 
about this rape and beating?

1446
01:32:39,300 --> 01:32:42,170
- 是的。
- 她带你去事发地点了？
- She did.
- Did she take you to where it happened?

1447
01:32:42,270 --> 01:32:43,740
是的，先生，在第二天上午。
Yes, the next morning.

1448
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:49,110
你有没有发现什么呢？任何与曼尼昂夫人
告诉你的情况有关的什么证据？
Did you find anything there pertaining 
to the story Mrs. Manion told you?

1449
01:32:49,210 --> 01:32:54,210
在林中的小径上，我们发现了
一些轮胎印和一些狗的足印，
On the lane in the woods we found 
some tire tracks and some dog tracks...

1450
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:58,880
还有一只皮质的盒子，
里面是一副角质架的眼镜。
and a leather case with 
some horn-rimmed glasses inside.

1451
01:32:58,990 --> 01:33:01,620
我们也试着找…
We also looked for...

1452
01:33:01,730 --> 01:33:04,790
曼尼昂夫人的一件内衣，但是没找到。
a certain undergarment of Mrs. Manion's, 
but we didn't find it.

1453
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:08,890
请双方律师到法官席前来。
Will the attorneys for both sides 
approach the bench?

1454
01:33:11,940 --> 01:33:15,770
比格勒先生，你最终还是
把你的强奸带进了这个案子。
Mr. Biegler, you've finally got 
your rape into the case.

1455
01:33:15,870 --> 01:33:19,830
我认为从现在起，陪审团必须了解所有的细节。
I think all the details should now 
be made clear to the jury.

1456
01:33:19,940 --> 01:33:23,670
- 你同意吗，罗德威克先生？
- 完全同意。
- Do you agree, Mr. Lodwick?
- Absolutely.

1457
01:33:23,780 --> 01:33:27,270
刚才提到的“内衣”到底是什么东西？
What exactly was the undergarment just referred to?

1458
01:33:27,380 --> 01:33:29,110
内裤，法官大人。
Panties, Your Honor.

1459
01:33:29,220 --> 01:33:32,660
- 你觉得它在后面还会出现吗？
- 是的，大人。
- Do you expect this to come up again?
- Yes, sir.

1460
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:37,060
“内裤”这个词听上去有点轻浮。
There's a certain light connotation 
attached to the word "panties."

1461
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:39,320
我们可以想一个其它的词代替吗?
Can we find another name for them?

1462
01:33:39,430 --> 01:33:42,160
我从没听过我妻子还有什么其它的叫法。
I never heard my wife call them anything else.

1463
01:33:42,270 --> 01:33:45,430
- 你呢，比格勒先生。
- 我是单身，法官大人。
- Mr. Biegler?
- I'm a bachelor, Your Honor.

1464
01:33:45,540 --> 01:33:48,270
真太有用了。丹瑟先生？
That's a great help. Mr. Dancer?

1465
01:33:48,370 --> 01:33:53,240
大战时我到过海外，法官大人，
我知道法文里怎么说。
I was overseas during the war.
I learned a French word.

1466
01:33:53,340 --> 01:33:55,610
但是我担心那个词有点挑逗性。
I'm afraid that might be slightly suggestive.

1467
01:33:55,710 --> 01:33:57,700
大部分法文单词都有点挑逗性。
Most French words are.

1468
01:33:57,810 --> 01:34:01,150
好吧，先生们，回到你们的座位上。
All right, gentlemen, back to your places.

1469
01:34:01,250 --> 01:34:06,150
为了有助于陪审团理解，
特别是为了旁听的观众，
For the benefit of the jury, but more 
especially for the spectators...

1470
01:34:06,260 --> 01:34:10,160
在上面的证词中所提到的“内衣”，
严格的说是指…
the undergarment referred to 
in the testimony was, to be exact...

1471
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:13,290
曼尼昂夫人的内裤。
Mrs. Manion's panties.

1472
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:19,970
我希望你们停止窃笑，下不为例。
I wanted you to get your snickering over and done with.

1473
01:34:20,070 --> 01:34:24,340
这条内裤在此番庭审过程中，将还会被提及，
This pair of panties will be mentioned 
again in the course of this trial.

1474
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:27,840
到时候在我的法庭上，不允许出现任何笑声，
And when it happens, there will not be 
one laugh, one snicker...

1475
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:32,100
不允许窃笑，不允许痴笑，甚至不允许暗笑。
one giggle or even one smirk in my courtroom.

1476
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:35,710
鉴于这条内裤已经引起了一名男子的暴死，
There isn't anything comic about a pair of panties...

1477
01:34:35,820 --> 01:34:39,310
也有可能导致另一名男子的囚禁，
which figure in the violent death of one man...

1478
01:34:39,420 --> 01:34:43,620
它其实没有任何喜剧色彩。
and the possible incarceration of another.

1479
01:34:43,730 --> 01:34:45,460
继续，比格勒先生。
Proceed, Mr. Biegler.

1480
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:47,690
你有没有给曼尼昂夫人做测谎仪测试？
Did you give Mrs. Manion a lie detector test?

1481
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:51,260
反对。测谎仪测试在法庭上
不能作为可接受的证据。
Objection. A polygraph test is 
inadmissible evidence in our courts.

1482
01:34:51,370 --> 01:34:54,740
我只是问他有没有做，
我又没问他测试结果。
I only asked if he gave the test.
I didn't ask the results.

1483
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:56,740
你可以回答这个问题。
He may answer that.

1484
01:34:56,840 --> 01:34:59,870
在她的要求下，我给她做了测谎仪测试。
I gave her a lie detector test at her request.

1485
01:34:59,980 --> 01:35:03,470
那么，在经过了所有这些调查之后，
你相信曼尼昂夫人吗？
Now after all this investigation, 
did you believe Mrs. Manion?

1486
01:35:03,580 --> 01:35:06,180
- 我相信。
- 甚至在做了测谎仪测试之后？
- I did.
- Even after the lie detector test?

1487
01:35:06,180 --> 01:35:11,640
法官大人，我反对这个提问！那是被告律师
明目张胆地利用卑鄙而狡猾的逃避手段。
That question constitutes flagrant 
subterfuge on part of the defense.

1488
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:13,350
反对有效。
Objection sustained.

1489
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:17,990
陪审团的女士们先生们，测谎仪测试…
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, 
a polygraph or lie detector test...

1490
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:20,000
不能作为可接受的证据，
is not admissible in evidence...

1491
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:22,220
因为从来没有人否定…
because no one has ever been quite sure...

1492
01:35:22,330 --> 01:35:26,100
有人可以对测谎仪撒谎并通过测试。
that some people couldn't lie 
to a lie detector and get away with it.

1493
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:27,830
继续，比格勒先生。
Go ahead.

1494
01:35:27,940 --> 01:35:31,930
总之，德构警官，以你自己心智和头脑判断，
In any case, you yourself 
in your own heart and mind...

1495
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:34,670
你非常确信曼尼昂夫人是诚实的？
are quite convinced of Mrs. Manion's honesty?

1496
01:35:34,780 --> 01:35:37,340
- 是的，先生。
- 我问完了。
- Yes, sir.
- That's all.

1497
01:35:38,620 --> 01:35:41,970
请等一会儿。
好的，当然。
Just a moment. 
Yes, of course.

1498
01:35:43,950 --> 01:35:48,860
德构警官，除了在林间小径，
你有没有在别的地方搜寻过那条内裤？
Did you look for the panties elsewhere 
other than the lane in the woods?

1499
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:52,190
我们还搜查了巴尼・奎尔的轿车，
和他旅店的房间。
We looked in Barney Quill's car, 
his room in the hotel.

1500
01:35:52,300 --> 01:35:53,760
我们没有找到内裤。
We didn't find them.

1501
01:35:53,860 --> 01:35:57,430
你知道曼尼昂夫人为什么
要求接受测谎仪测试吗？
Do you know why Mrs. Manion 
requested a lie detector test?

1502
01:35:57,530 --> 01:35:59,430
- 我记得她曾说过。
- 说过什么？
- I know what she said.
- What?

1503
01:35:59,540 --> 01:36:03,400
她想让大家相信她的话，
因为她知道那样会有助于他丈夫。
She wanted everyone to believe her story 
because she knew it'd help her husband.

1504
01:36:03,410 --> 01:36:05,170
那是她给你的唯一理由吗？
Was that the only reason she gave?

1505
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:09,580
她说她已经向她丈夫起过誓，
她希望别的人也都相信她。
Said she swore to her husband. Said she 
wanted everyone else to believe it too.

1506
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:11,580
请稍等一下，法官大人。
One moment, please.

1507
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:17,910
问问他她以何种方式起的誓。
Ask him in what manner she swore.

1508
01:36:18,020 --> 01:36:21,320
那么曼尼昂夫人有没有说
她是怎样向她丈夫起的誓？
Did Mrs. Manion say how 
she had sworn to her husband?

1509
01:36:21,420 --> 01:36:25,360
说了，先生。她说她以《玫瑰经》起的誓。
Yes, sir. She said she had sworn on a rosary.

1510
01:36:25,460 --> 01:36:30,300
德构警官，那条林中小径，
是干什么用的？它通向哪里？
This lane in the woods, 
what's it used for, where does it go?

1511
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:33,600
以前是运伐木用的，不通向哪里，是死路。
It used to be a logging road.
It doesn't go anyplace, just stops.

1512
01:36:33,700 --> 01:36:35,600
现在谁会用呢？
Who uses it now?

1513
01:36:35,710 --> 01:36:37,940
我想是孩子们去公园玩时用的路。
I think it's a road kids drive down to park.

1514
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:40,670
- 你的意思是那是一条情人小径？
- 我想是的。
- You mean it's a lovers' lane?
- I think so.

1515
01:36:40,780 --> 01:36:43,340
- 你来问吧，比格勒先生。
- 没有问题了。
- The witness is yours.
- No more questions.

1516
01:36:43,350 --> 01:36:47,180
- 证人可以退下了。
- 鉴于法官大人您裁定…
- The witness may step down.
- In view of evidence concerning rape...

1517
01:36:47,190 --> 01:36:49,550
涉及强奸的证据可以纳入本案，
which Your Honor has ruled admissible...

1518
01:36:49,550 --> 01:36:51,480
公诉方请求30分钟休庭，
the prosecution asks for a 30-minute recess...

1519
01:36:51,490 --> 01:36:55,080
以便我方带另一位证人出庭，
尽管我们原本并没有安排。
in order to bring in another witness 
we had not anticipated using?

1520
01:36:55,080 --> 01:36:57,790
好的。休庭30分钟。
All right. We'll take a 30-minute recess.

1521
01:36:57,790 --> 01:36:59,280
现在休庭。
Recess.

1522
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:08,670
为什么你没有告诉我那什么《玫瑰经》？
Why didn't you tell me about that rosary?

1523
01:37:10,010 --> 01:37:11,910
我忘了。
I forgot it.

1524
01:37:12,010 --> 01:37:16,570
我们没忘。曼尼说也许我们不应该再提起此事。
We didn't forget it. Manny said maybe 
we shouldn't tell that again.

1525
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:20,580
因为这看上去像有别的问题――
像是我不相信她。
It might have looked like something 
else-- like I didn't believe her.

1526
01:37:21,750 --> 01:37:26,920
- 你还有什么事没告诉我？
- 什么都告诉你了，所有事都告诉你了。
- How much more didn't you tell me?
- We told you everything else.

1527
01:37:27,020 --> 01:37:29,050
是这样吗，劳拉？
Is that right, Laura?

1528
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:31,320
噢，是的，所有的事。
Oh, yes, everything else.

1529
01:37:31,430 --> 01:37:33,590
好的，听着，你们两个。
Now get this, both of you.

1530
01:37:33,700 --> 01:37:37,630
当你们走上证人席时，
我希望你们讲出事实。
When you get up on that stand, 
I want you to tell the truth.

1531
01:37:37,730 --> 01:37:40,230
我希望你们除了事实，不讲别的。
I don't want you to tell anything but the truth.

1532
01:37:40,340 --> 01:37:45,210
你们不要试着撒谎，不要试着隐瞒任何事情，
否则的话你们会被生吞活剥的。
Don't try and lie or conceal anything 
or you get skinned alive.

1533
01:37:45,310 --> 01:37:48,340
丹瑟那伙计就要出场了。
This fellow Dancer's gonna move in.

1534
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:12,060
东比埃尔医生，今年8月15日夜晚，
Dr. Dompierre, did you have occasion 
to come to the county jail...

1535
01:38:12,170 --> 01:38:14,530
你有没有来过本县的监狱？
on the night of August 15 this year?

1536
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:17,270
- 来过。
- 谁招你到监狱来的？
- I did.
- Who called you to the jail?

1537
01:38:17,370 --> 01:38:20,780
- 警方当局。
- 他们让你来干什么？
- The police authorities.
- What did they want you to do?

1538
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:23,850
他们想让我在弗雷德里克・曼尼昂夫人身上，
They wanted me to make a test 
for the presence of sperm...

1539
01:38:23,950 --> 01:38:26,310
做有没有精子的测试。
on the person of a Mrs. Frederick Manion.

1540
01:38:26,420 --> 01:38:30,220
- 我做了测试。
- 你做了测试，你的结论是什么？
- I made the test.
- What was your conclusion?

1541
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:33,850
- 阴性，没有精子。
- 你的证人，比格勒先生。
- Negative. There was none.
- Your witness.

1542
01:38:34,930 --> 01:38:39,760
医生，在你做这些测试的时候，
你有没有注意到曼尼昂夫人身上的瘀伤痕迹？
In making these tests, did you notice
any bruises or marks on Mrs. Manion?

1543
01:38:39,860 --> 01:38:41,130
注意到了。
I did.

1544
01:38:41,230 --> 01:38:43,720
有没有人要求你鉴定这些瘀伤的原因？
Were you asked to determine 
the reason for these bruises?

1545
01:38:43,830 --> 01:38:47,770
- 没有。
- 你在哪儿做的实验来检测有没有精子？
- I was not.
- Where did you do the lab work?

1546
01:38:47,870 --> 01:38:50,170
市内的“圣玛格丽特医院”。
St. Margaret's Hospital in the city.

1547
01:38:50,270 --> 01:38:54,330
- 谁为你准备的显微镜用的玻璃片？
- 医院里的技师。
- Who worked up the slides for you?
- Technician at the hospital.

1548
01:38:54,440 --> 01:38:56,500
那么是否由病理学家…
Wouldn't it have been better...

1549
01:38:56,610 --> 01:39:00,610
或这方面的专家来准备这些玻璃片更加好呢？
to have these slides worked up by 
a pathologist or expert in this field?

1550
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:03,310
是的，可是警方催得很急。
Yes, but the police were in a hurry.

1551
01:39:03,310 --> 01:39:06,550
我碰巧认识那个一大早7点
就来上班的年轻小伙儿。
I happened to know this young fella 
came on at 7:00 in the morning.

1552
01:39:06,550 --> 01:39:09,350
由于测试的结果是判断强奸疑问的关键，
Wouldn't it have been especially better 
to wait for the expert...

1553
01:39:09,350 --> 01:39:12,260
那么等待专家来做，是否显得尤其重要呢？
if the possible question of rape hung on the result?

1554
01:39:12,350 --> 01:39:16,460
- 也许是吧。
- 医生，8月16日的晚报上说…
- It would have been.
- In the newspaper of August 16...

1555
01:39:16,570 --> 01:39:19,630
你没有发现强奸的证据，那是事实吗？
it was stated that you found 
no evidence of rape, is that true?

1556
01:39:19,740 --> 01:39:22,100
不是事实。我没有说过那样的话。
It is not true. I made no such statement.

1557
01:39:22,210 --> 01:39:26,160
那么关于曼尼昂夫人有否遭到强奸，
你有自己的见解吗？
But did you form an opinion as to 
whether Mrs. Manion had been raped?

1558
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:28,370
- 没有。
- 为什么没有？
- No.
- Why didn't you form an opinion?

1559
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:32,710
因为对于一个成熟的已婚女子来说，
你不可能判断她是否遭到强奸。
It's impossible to tell if a mature 
married woman has been raped.

1560
01:39:32,820 --> 01:39:34,340
我问完了。
That's all.

1561
01:39:34,350 --> 01:39:38,980
医生，关于她最近和男人是否发生过关系，
你是怎么看的呢？
Did you have an opinion about whether 
she had any recent relations with a man?

1562
01:39:39,090 --> 01:39:42,290
唔，因为没有发现精子，
Well, as far as no sperm was present...

1563
01:39:42,390 --> 01:39:44,830
所以看起来她最近没有和男人有过关系。
it didn't appear she had 
a recent relation with a man.

1564
01:39:44,930 --> 01:39:47,620
- 我问完了。
- 我还有一个问题，医生。
- That's all.
- Just one more question, Doctor.

1565
01:39:47,730 --> 01:39:50,170
在她体内没有发现精子，并不意味着…
The fact that no evidence was present in her body...

1566
01:39:50,270 --> 01:39:52,600
她没有被强奸，是这样吗？
does not mean that she was not raped, does it?

1567
01:39:52,700 --> 01:39:53,900
是的。
No.

1568
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,670
你知道在法律上强奸罪是怎么构成的吗？
Do you know what constitutes rape under the law?

1569
01:39:56,670 --> 01:39:57,870
知道，先生。
Yes, sir.

1570
01:39:57,970 --> 01:40:02,310
侵害就足够构成强奸，
没有说一定要完成。
Violation is sufficient for rape.
There need not be a completion.

1571
01:40:02,410 --> 01:40:04,970
- 没有问题了。
- 证人可以退下。
- No further questions.
- The witness may step down.

1572
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:08,480
公诉方再次传唤阿尔方斯・帕盖特到证人席。
The people recall Alphonse Paquette to the stand.

1573
01:40:08,590 --> 01:40:12,390
法官大人，既然辩方律师
硬要加进强奸的问题，
Since counsel for the defense 
has forced the question of rape...

1574
01:40:12,490 --> 01:40:15,940
那么有必要从帕盖特先生那里
获得额外的证词。
it becomes necessary to take this 
additional testimony from Mr. Paquette.

1575
01:40:16,030 --> 01:40:18,630
你的宣誓仍然有效，帕盖特先生。
You're still under oath, Mr. Paquette.

1576
01:40:18,730 --> 01:40:20,130
帕盖特先生，
Mr. Paquette...

1577
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:24,960
请你观察一下那儿
坐在被告桌后面的曼尼昂夫人，
would you take a look at Mrs. Manion
seated there behind the defense table.

1578
01:40:25,070 --> 01:40:27,500
发生枪击的那个晚上，
她也是这样穿戴的吗？
Was she dressed in this manner 
the night of the shooting?

1579
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:29,870
- 不是。
- 她是怎样穿戴的？
- No.
- How was she dressed?

1580
01:40:29,870 --> 01:40:34,770
她穿了条相当紧的裙子，
还有运动衫之类的，像粘在身上。
She had on a real tight skirt and 
sweater kind of thing, sort of glued on.

1581
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:37,510
她穿了双红色的高跟鞋。
She was wearing red shoes with high heels.

1582
01:40:37,610 --> 01:40:41,020
- 她穿长筒袜了吗？
- 没有，她光着腿。
- Was she wearing hose?
- No, she was bare-legged.

1583
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:43,880
- 她戴帽子没有？
- 没有。
- Was she wearing a hat?
- No.

1584
01:40:43,990 --> 01:40:47,650
帕盖特先生，在那顶帽子下面，
曼尼昂夫人是哪一种头发？
What kind of hair does Mrs. Manion 
have under that hat?

1585
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:51,250
噢，我们非常乐意向法庭展示
曼尼昂夫人的头发。
We'd be very happy to show the court 
Mrs. Manion's hair.

1586
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:54,260
曼尼昂夫人，请将你的帽子摘掉好吗？
Mrs. Manion, would you take off your hat, please?

1587
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,590
谢谢，比格勒先生。
Thank you, Mr. Biegler.

1588
01:40:59,700 --> 01:41:03,000
帕盖特先生，那晚她戴眼镜了吗？
Was she wearing glasses that night?

1589
01:41:03,110 --> 01:41:05,600
我想她玩弹球游戏时戴着的。
I think she was when she played pinball.

1590
01:41:05,710 --> 01:41:10,140
考虑到紧身的裙子、紧身的运动衫、
还有光着的腿，
Considering the tight skirt and 
the tight sweater and the bare legs...

1591
01:41:10,250 --> 01:41:13,370
她看上去的效果怎么样？
what was the result in her appearance?

1592
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:18,010
在你看来她是不是故意打扮得妖冶迷人？
Would you say her appearance was 
deliberately voluptuous and enticing?

1593
01:41:18,020 --> 01:41:19,880
可以说是曲线毕露吧。
You could see everything she had.

1594
01:41:19,890 --> 01:41:23,480
法官大人，辩方愿意承认
当穿着非正式的衣服时，
The defense will concede that 
Mrs. Manion when dressed informally...

1595
01:41:23,590 --> 01:41:26,790
曼尼昂夫人的美的确今人眩目，我们……
is an astonishingly beautiful woman and we--

1596
01:41:26,900 --> 01:41:29,160
曼尼昂夫人，请站起来好吗？
Mrs. Manion, stand up, please, will you?

1597
01:41:29,260 --> 01:41:31,460
事实是…把你的眼镜摘下…
As a matter of fact-- Take your glasses off.

1598
01:41:31,570 --> 01:41:35,800
事实是，非常容易理解为什么
他丈夫会暂时性地失去理智，
It's pretty easy to understand why her 
husband became temporarily deranged...

1599
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:39,670
当他看到这样一个美人
被一头野兽殴打和凌辱！
when he saw such beauty bruised 
and torn by a beast!

1600
01:41:39,680 --> 01:41:41,770
法官大人，我抗议。
Your Honor, I protest.

1601
01:41:41,780 --> 01:41:43,940
比格勒先生也许是我见过的…
Mr. Biegler is perhaps the least disciplined...

1602
01:41:44,050 --> 01:41:47,450
在法庭上最不守纪律的
和最颠三倒四的律师。
and the most completely out of order 
attorney I've ever seen in a courtroom.

1603
01:41:47,550 --> 01:41:50,450
陪审团会无视比格勒先生的措辞。
The jury will ignore Mr. Biegler's oration.

1604
01:41:54,050 --> 01:41:57,020
曼尼昂夫人那天晚上酒喝得多吗？
Was Mrs. Manion drinking heavily that night?

1605
01:41:57,120 --> 01:42:01,180
我自己给了她六杯，
巴尼过来后又给了她一些。
I sold her six drinks myself and 
Barney came over and got more for her.

1606
01:42:01,290 --> 01:42:04,230
- 我不记得有多少了。
- 她是不是有点醉了呢？
- I don't remember how many.
- Would you say she was tight?

1607
01:42:04,330 --> 01:42:07,290
- 当然她已经喝高了。
- 她怎样的举止让你觉得她已经喝高了呢？
- She was high, all right.
- What did she do to make you think that?

1608
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:10,400
她脱掉了鞋子，光着脚走路。
She took off her shoes and went barefooted.

1609
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:14,730
她玩弹球时，她舞动着身子和游戏机说话。
When she played pinball, she'd swish 
around to give the machine English.

1610
01:42:14,730 --> 01:42:18,130
你的意思是她抖动着臀部？
You mean she was flipping her hips around?

1611
01:42:18,140 --> 01:42:20,330
- 是的。
- 还有呢？
- Yeah.
- Anything else?

1612
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:26,140
每当赢得一个高分，她就蹦蹦跳跳，
大呼小叫，女人一般都这样。
When she made a good score, she jumped 
up and down and squealed like women do.

1613
01:42:26,150 --> 01:42:28,510
那晚她和巴尼・奎尔玩过弹球，
She was playing pinball with Barney Quill that night.

1614
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:29,710
- 是吗？
- 是的。
- Wasn't she?
- Yes.

1615
01:42:29,820 --> 01:42:32,120
她对巴尼・奎尔的态度如何？
What was her attitude toward Barney Quill?

1616
01:42:32,220 --> 01:42:35,280
- 很友好，我想你可以这样说。
- 你是说不仅仅是很友好？
- Friendly.
- More than friendly, would you say?

1617
01:42:35,390 --> 01:42:38,120
- 我想是的。
- 为什么你会这样认为？
- I thought so.
- Why did you think so?

1618
01:42:38,230 --> 01:42:41,250
因为他像是靠在他身上。
She'd kind of lean on him.

1619
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:43,260
有几次她还用臀部撞他。
A couple of times she bumped him with her hip.

1620
01:42:45,150 --> 01:42:49,310
在你看来曼尼昂夫人是不是
在设法引诱巴尼・奎尔？
Would you say that Mrs. Manion 
was making a play for Barney Quill?

1621
01:42:49,420 --> 01:42:52,860
反对！这是个引起证人
做出猜测回答的问题，法官大人。
Objection. That calls for an assumption 
on the part of the witness.

1622
01:42:52,860 --> 01:42:55,460
我撤回问题。那么在你看来…
I withdraw the question. Would you say...

1623
01:42:55,460 --> 01:42:58,260
曼尼昂夫人和巴尼・奎尔是不是很随随便便？
Mrs. Manion was free and easy with Barney Quill?

1624
01:42:58,260 --> 01:43:00,260
- 是的。
- 你来问吧，比格勒先生。
- I would.
- Your witness.

1625
01:43:00,260 --> 01:43:01,870
帕盖特先生，
Mr. Paquette...

1626
01:43:01,870 --> 01:43:06,100
公诉方律师问你曼尼昂夫人是否“有点醉”，
the attorney for the people 
asked you if Mrs. Manion was "tight"...

1627
01:43:06,210 --> 01:43:08,640
你回答说她“喝高了”。
and you said that she was "high."

1628
01:43:08,650 --> 01:43:12,410
那么从一个酒吧侍者的观点来看，
这两者的区别是什么呢？
Now, speaking as a bartender, 
what's the distinction between the two?

1629
01:43:12,410 --> 01:43:17,120
- 我不明白你想问什么。
- 唔…我的意思是，当我们说一个人“有点醉”的时候，
- I don't understand.
- When we say a person's "tight"...

1630
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:21,490
我们通常是指他喝得有点麻木了，是这样吗？
we usually mean they're a little stupid 
with the drink, isn't that so?

1631
01:43:21,490 --> 01:43:23,260
我想是这样，对。
I guess so.

1632
01:43:23,260 --> 01:43:27,390
要是说他“喝高了”，
那是指他很愉快，很享受。
And if they're "high" they're gay 
and enjoying themselves.

1633
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:29,760
换句话说，曼尼昂夫人当时很快乐。
In other words, Mrs. Manion was happy.

1634
01:43:29,770 --> 01:43:32,500
在“雷鸣湾旅店”很快乐有什么不对吗？
Is there anything wrong with being happy 
in Thunder Bay Inn?

1635
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:33,460
不。
No.

1636
01:43:33,470 --> 01:43:36,600
雷鸣湾本身就是一个度假胜地，不是吗？
Thunder Bay itself is a resort, isn't it?

1637
01:43:36,710 --> 01:43:39,670
- 游泳，钓鱼，诸如此类的。
- 是的。
- Swimming, fishing, that sort of thing.
- Yes.

1638
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:43,240
那么在雷鸣湾见到一位赤着脚的女士
有什么非同寻常的吗？
Is there anything unusual about seeing 
a barefooted woman in Thunder Bay?

1639
01:43:43,350 --> 01:43:44,270
不。
No.

1640
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:46,980
因此曼尼昂夫人在雷鸣湾脱掉她的鞋子，
So Mrs. Manion's taking her shoes off 
in Thunder Bay...

1641
01:43:46,980 --> 01:43:49,950
并不意味着她有失体统，是吗？
that doesn't mean she's being unladylike, does it?

1642
01:43:49,950 --> 01:43:52,050
- 我想是的。
- 是还是不是？
- I guess not.
- Yes or no?

1643
01:43:52,050 --> 01:43:53,850
是！
No!

1644
01:43:55,360 --> 01:44:00,390
你还作证说曼尼昂夫人大呼小叫，
Now, you testified that Mrs. Manion was squealing...

1645
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:02,700
蹦蹦跳跳，
and jumping up and down...

1646
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:05,970
舞动着――我想那是你的说法――
and swishing her-- I think that 
was the expression you used--

1647
01:44:05,970 --> 01:44:08,330
在弹球机旁舞动着臀部。
swishing her hips around the pinball machine.

1648
01:44:08,340 --> 01:44:12,010
那么她有没有引起骚乱呢？
她有没有吸引众人的注意力呢？
Now, was she creating a disturbance?
Was she attracting a crowd?

1649
01:44:12,010 --> 01:44:12,410
没有。
No.

1650
01:44:12,410 --> 01:44:15,670
在酒吧的所有男人，是不是都站成一圈，
看着曼尼昂夫人呢？
Were the men at the bar all 
standing around watching Mrs. Manion?

1651
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:18,160
- 不是。
- 但是你却非常注意曼尼昂夫人，
- No.
- But you were very conscious of her.

1652
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:21,080
你如此注意她，以至于你能够
告诉我们她的所有举动？
Conscious enough so that you can tell us 
all about her actions?

1653
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:22,780
- 是的。
- 我确信巴尼・奎尔…
- Yes.
- And certainly Barney Quill...

1654
01:44:22,790 --> 01:44:26,890
他也非常注意曼尼昂夫人，因为他和她
在玩弹球游戏，你同意吗？
he was conscious of her because 
he was playing pinball with her, right?

1655
01:44:26,890 --> 01:44:27,290
同意。
Yes.

1656
01:44:27,290 --> 01:44:31,520
因此，似乎只有你和巴尼・奎尔敏锐地注意…
So it seems that only you 
and Barney Quill were acutely aware...

1657
01:44:31,530 --> 01:44:34,830
到了曼尼昂夫人，她的举止和穿着。
of Mrs. Manion and her actions and her appearance.

1658
01:44:34,830 --> 01:44:37,560
也许可爱的老巴尼走了过来，
从你手里要过些喝的，
Maybe good old Barney when he came up 
to get some drinks from you...

1659
01:44:37,570 --> 01:44:41,970
也许他朝你眨眨眼说：“阿尔方斯，
我要做了这个宝贝，我要强奸她。”
maybe he winked and said, "Alphonse, 
I'm gonna take this babe and rape her."

1660
01:44:41,970 --> 01:44:44,040
- 不！他没有！
- 是啊，也许你回答说：
- No, he didn't.
- Maybe you said...

1661
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:46,060
“替我也做她一次，老板。”
"Do it once for me, boss."

1662
01:44:46,060 --> 01:44:48,260
反对！反对！这个问题……
Objection.

1663
01:44:48,260 --> 01:44:50,400
没有问题了！
No more questions!

1664
01:44:51,010 --> 01:44:55,150
这样的混战已经持续了整整一天了，
我想本法庭也快受不了了。
The court's had about all of this 
dogfight it can take for one day.

1665
01:44:55,150 --> 01:44:58,590
我相信陪审团也一样感到
精疲力尽、饥肠辘辘。
And I'm sure the jury is 
equally tired and hungry.

1666
01:44:58,590 --> 01:45:02,790
明天是辩护方的主辩，
我希望辩方律师加快一点，
Tomorrow the defense takes over 
and with expedition, prayer...

1667
01:45:02,790 --> 01:45:04,890
收敛一点，自我约束一点，
and a little self-discipline 
on the part of counsel...

1668
01:45:04,900 --> 01:45:07,830
这样也许到周六晚上，我们就可以结束了。
perhaps we can reach an end by Saturday night.

1669
01:45:07,830 --> 01:45:10,030
现在休庭吧。
Will you adjourn court?

1670
01:45:10,630 --> 01:45:12,560
注意，注意，注意，
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.

1671
01:45:12,570 --> 01:45:16,270
本法庭现在休庭，
明天上午9点继续开庭。
This court stands adjourned 
until 9:00 tomorrow morning.

1672
01:45:57,260 --> 01:46:00,260
他就撞了一下，没什么特别严重的。
He's banged up a little, but there 
doesn't seem to be anything else.

1673
01:46:00,260 --> 01:46:02,360
我们再观察他一两天吧。
We'd like to watch him for a day or so.

1674
01:46:02,860 --> 01:46:04,960
他损坏了什么东西吗？
How much damage did he do?

1675
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:07,480
撞坏了一道大门和一扇谷仓的门。
Wrecked a gate and a barn door.

1676
01:46:08,260 --> 01:46:10,690
而且他没有驾照。
He hasn't got a driver's license.

1677
01:46:11,860 --> 01:46:15,700
当他能动时，他必须去普通治安法庭报道，
He'll have to appear 
in the J.P. court when he's able...

1678
01:46:15,700 --> 01:46:17,300
老傻瓜。
the old fool.

1679
01:46:17,300 --> 01:46:19,700
对死者厚道点。
Speak kindly of the dead.

1680
01:46:19,700 --> 01:46:21,970
能让我和尸体单独呆一会儿吗？
Mind if I have a minute with the corpse?

1681
01:46:21,970 --> 01:46:23,530
当然，保利。
Sure.

1682
01:46:27,240 --> 01:46:30,280
说说看，你到底在忙活什么呢，
Now, was it worth trying to kill yourself...

1683
01:46:30,280 --> 01:46:33,380
连老命都不要了？
for whatever it is you've been up to?

1684
01:46:33,380 --> 01:46:35,380
庭审进行得如何？
How is the trial going?

1685
01:46:35,380 --> 01:46:38,620
我整出不少动静，丹瑟针锋相对。
I'm making a lot of noise 
and Dancer's racking up all the points.

1686
01:46:38,620 --> 01:46:42,050
可是快点啊，你究竟去哪儿啦？
But come on. Where have you been?

1687
01:46:42,050 --> 01:46:46,330
奎尔从北面的圣玛丽急流市【安大略】
雇来的玛丽・皮兰特。
Quill hired Mary Pilant up north 
of Sault St. Marie.

1688
01:46:46,330 --> 01:46:50,730
我感到奇怪的是他为何大老远地
跑这么多路去雇某个人为他工作。
Struck me funny he'd go all the way up 
there to hire somebody to work for him.

1689
01:46:50,730 --> 01:46:52,900
于是我也去那里打探了一下。
I've been up there nosing around.

1690
01:46:52,900 --> 01:46:55,130
你发现什么有用的东西了吗？
Did you find anything useful?

1691
01:46:55,140 --> 01:46:58,260
我查到了她的出生证。
Not until I looked up her birth certificate.

1692
01:46:58,260 --> 01:47:02,010
1934年，她出生于安大略的盲人河，
Born Blind River, Ontario, 1934...

1693
01:47:02,010 --> 01:47:03,970
未婚所生。
out of wedlock.

1694
01:47:04,010 --> 01:47:08,110
母亲是一个女侍者，叫西蒙妮・皮兰特。
Mother was a waitress, Simone Pilant.

1695
01:47:08,120 --> 01:47:12,610
父亲是伐木工人，叫巴尼・奎尔。
Father was a lumberjack named Barney Quill.

1696
01:47:19,830 --> 01:47:23,800
- 我想见玛丽・皮兰特小姐。
- 已经很晚了，先生。
- I'd like to see Miss Mary Pilant.
- It's late, mister.

1697
01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:25,930
我知道，我知道。但这事很重要。
I know. This is important.

1698
01:47:25,930 --> 01:47:28,270
- 真的很重要？
- 真的很重要。
- Real important?
- Real important.

1699
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:35,270
- 是我。
- 皮兰特小姐，抱歉把你吵醒了。
- Yes?
- Miss Pilant, sorry if I woke you.

1700
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:37,480
有个人想见你，说有重要事情。
There's a guy to see you.
Says it's real important.

1701
01:47:37,480 --> 01:47:39,780
- 你的名……
- 保罗・比格勒。
- What's your--
- Paul Biegler.

1702
01:47:39,780 --> 01:47:43,080
- 我不想见他。
- 好的。
- I don't wish to see him,
- Okay.

1703
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:46,120
她说那事不够重要。
She said it's not important enough.

1704
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:50,260
好吧，那你再给她打过去，告诉她
我提到了安大略的盲人河。
Call her back and tell her I mentioned 
Blind River, Ontario.

1705
01:47:50,260 --> 01:47:52,560
我会在酒吧里。
I'll be in the bar.

1706
01:48:08,310 --> 01:48:09,660
晚上好，阿尔方斯。
Good evening, Alphonse.

1707
01:48:09,860 --> 01:48:12,690
喝点什么还是仅四下瞅瞅？
Drinking or just snooping?

1708
01:48:12,700 --> 01:48:16,650
唔，我想我两样都会做一点儿。
你看先给我来点啤酒怎么样？
I think I'll try a little of both.
What do you say we start with a beer.

1709
01:48:21,860 --> 01:48:24,790
本店请客。
你只能得到这些――一瓶啤酒。
On the house.
And that's all you get-- a beer.

1710
01:48:24,790 --> 01:48:26,860
没有问题，没有回答。
No questions, no answers.

1711
01:48:26,860 --> 01:48:29,430
我只是个律师，想做好我的工作。
I'm just a lawyer trying to do my job.

1712
01:48:29,430 --> 01:48:31,770
你有什么好怕的呢，嗯？
What are you so afraid of?

1713
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:36,760
我们坐到那边去，行吗？
Let's sit over there, please.

1714
01:48:42,740 --> 01:48:47,210
皮兰特小姐，我得向你道歉，
因为我上次来这儿时不是太有礼貌。
Miss Pilant, I owe you an apology.
I was rough when I was here before.

1715
01:48:48,220 --> 01:48:50,320
我不知道巴尼・奎尔是你父亲。
I didn't know Barney Quill was your father.

1716
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:52,860
你不是为了向我道歉才来的吧。
You didn't come here just to apologize.

1717
01:48:52,860 --> 01:48:55,260
不是，但是道歉是目的之一。
No, but the apology was part of it.

1718
01:48:55,260 --> 01:48:59,990
开诚布公地说，我是希望
能够和你达成一点谅解。
To tell you the truth, I was hoping 
it would thaw you out a little bit.

1719
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,260
我希望你做的，就是听我说几句话，就几分钟。
All I want you to do is listen to me, 
just for a few minutes.

1720
01:49:04,260 --> 01:49:09,230
我需要一些强有力的证据，用来支持
劳拉・曼尼昂有关强奸的说法。
I need some strong evidence to back up 
Laura Manion's story about the rape.

1721
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:12,740
公诉方会严厉抨击这一说法。
The prosecution's gonna attack 
that story pretty hard.

1722
01:49:12,740 --> 01:49:15,340
如果陪审团认定她在撒谎，
And if the jury thinks she's lying...

1723
01:49:15,340 --> 01:49:18,260
那么他们的裁决就会对曼尼昂不利，你明白吗？
that could turn the decision against Manion.

1724
01:49:18,260 --> 01:49:20,380
那么她没有撒谎吗？
Isn't she lying?

1725
01:49:20,380 --> 01:49:23,260
巴尼没有做过她说的事，他不可能做。
Barney didn't do what she said he did.
He couldn't have.

1726
01:49:23,260 --> 01:49:27,520
- 关于你父亲你了解多少？
- 了解一切。
- What did you know about your father?
- All I needed to know.

1727
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:31,590
他精心照顾我，也精心照顾我妈妈，直到她去世。
He took care of me and my mother 
for as long as she lived.

1728
01:49:31,590 --> 01:49:34,960
当我需要他时，他总是在我身旁。
He was always there when I needed him.

1729
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:37,630
这就是我了解的父亲，比格勒先生。
That's what I know about my father, Mr. Biegler.

1730
01:49:37,630 --> 01:49:39,930
那会支持劳拉・曼尼昂的说法吗？
Will that back up Laura Manion's story?

1731
01:49:39,940 --> 01:49:43,070
我不是想和你过不去，我也不想伤害你。
I don't want to get at you, hurt you.

1732
01:49:43,070 --> 01:49:45,900
我很赞赏你对你父亲的爱。
I appreciate your affection for your father.

1733
01:49:46,010 --> 01:49:51,540
但是作为一个律师，我见得太多了，
人不可能简单地划分为好人和坏人，
But as a lawyer I've had to learn 
that people aren't just good or bad...

1734
01:49:51,650 --> 01:49:53,640
人是多方面的。
but people are many things.

1735
01:49:53,650 --> 01:49:57,280
我有种感觉，巴尼・奎尔就是多方面的。
And I kind of have a feeling 
Barney Quill was many things.

1736
01:49:57,290 --> 01:50:00,380
- 我不想再听下去了。
- 请别走，请听我说完好吗？
- I don't want to hear any more.
- No, please. Hear me out.

1737
01:50:00,390 --> 01:50:04,360
我相信巴尼跟阿尔・帕盖特
谈过那晚发生的事。
I believe that Barney told Al Paquette 
what happened that night.

1738
01:50:04,360 --> 01:50:07,660
他让他去那扇窗子旁等着曼尼昂。
And he told him to go to this window 
and wait for Manion.

1739
01:50:07,660 --> 01:50:12,500
巴尼呆在吧台后面，
紧挨着枪架，就那样等着。
Barney stayed behind the bar 
next to a gun rack, just waiting.

1740
01:50:12,500 --> 01:50:16,000
曼尼昂走了进来，
刚一迈进那道门就开枪射击，
Manion came in and fired 
the minute he got inside that door...

1741
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,800
第一枪就正好穿过巴尼的心脏。
and the first shot 
went right through Barney's heart.

1742
01:50:18,810 --> 01:50:21,140
下面是我想请你帮我做的。
Now here's what I want you to do.

1743
01:50:21,140 --> 01:50:24,140
我想请你试着说服阿尔，
I want you to try to persuade Al 
to come to the court...

1744
01:50:24,150 --> 01:50:28,880
作为辩方证人出庭，让他告诉法庭
那晚巴尼告诉他的事――
as a defense witness and tell the court
what Barney told him that night--

1745
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:31,850
也就是他强奸和殴打曼尼昂夫人的事实。
that he raped and assaulted Mrs. Manion.

1746
01:50:31,850 --> 01:50:36,620
阿尔不会把那样的事隐瞒起来。
要真是那样的话，他为什么不把它说出来？
Al wouldn't conceal a thing like that.
Why wouldn't he tell it if it were true?

1747
01:50:36,630 --> 01:50:39,920
我不知道，我不知道。但是我知道这个。
I don't know. But I know this.

1748
01:50:39,930 --> 01:50:43,600
每个人都会爱什么事情或者什么人。
Everybody loves something or someone.

1749
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:47,930
譬如说我，我爱钓鱼，
还有一个叫帕内尔的老家伙。
Me, I love fishing and an old guy 
by the name of Parnell.

1750
01:50:47,940 --> 01:50:51,540
曼尼昂爱他的自由。
他希望能获得更多一点的自由。
Manion loves his freedom.
He'd like to have a little more of it.

1751
01:50:51,540 --> 01:50:55,670
巴尼爱你，也许阿尔也爱着你。
Barney loved you. Maybe so does Al.

1752
01:50:55,680 --> 01:50:57,840
我不会怪他，
I wouldn't blame him.

1753
01:50:57,850 --> 01:51:01,650
因为他不想伤害你，
或是不想让你知道巴尼的真相――
But he doesn't want to hurt you or 
for you to know the truth about Barney--

1754
01:51:01,650 --> 01:51:03,850
即他可能会变得很危险和残忍。
that he could be dangerous and brutal.

1755
01:51:03,850 --> 01:51:08,480
那么，你能不能就问一下阿尔，
直接了当地问他一下。
Now, if you just ask Al--
if you just ask him right straight out.

1756
01:51:08,980 --> 01:51:10,300
阿尔。
Al.

1757
01:51:18,300 --> 01:51:22,300
阿尔，比格勒先生知道了巴尼是我父亲。
Al, Mr. Biegler knows that Barney was my father.

1758
01:51:23,510 --> 01:51:27,310
他认为关于我父亲被杀的那个晚上，
你知道一些事――
He thinks you know something
about the night my father was killed--

1759
01:51:27,310 --> 01:51:29,140
一些你不愿说出来的事。
something you won't tell.

1760
01:51:29,140 --> 01:51:33,510
律师，我已经告诉过你一次，
那么我再告诉你――没有问题，没有回答。
Lawyer, I told you once and I'll tell 
you again-- No questions, no answers.

1761
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:35,270
慢着，阿尔！
Wait.

1762
01:51:37,260 --> 01:51:40,620
我父亲强奸了曼尼昂夫人吗？
Did my father rape Mrs. Manion?

1763
01:51:40,620 --> 01:51:42,950
巴尼不会伤害一个女人。
Barney wouldn't hurt a woman.

1764
01:51:44,460 --> 01:51:48,760
有没有什么原因
使你不愿告诉我事实真相？
Is there any reason you wouldn't
tell me the truth about that?

1765
01:51:49,260 --> 01:51:51,260
什么原因？
What reason?

1766
01:51:57,040 --> 01:51:59,200
还有别的事吗，比格勒先生？
Anything else?

1767
01:51:59,740 --> 01:52:02,740
我给你和阿尔留下最后判决的通行证，
I'm going to leave a pass 
for you and Al at the trial.

1768
01:52:02,740 --> 01:52:06,610
或许你们乐意去看看
曼尼昂中尉被判有罪。
You might like to watch 
Lt. Manion get convicted.

1769
01:52:06,620 --> 01:52:08,980
你会四下散布玛丽是巴尼女儿的消息吗？
You going to spread it around 
about Mary being Barney's kid?

1770
01:52:08,980 --> 01:52:12,750
不，我不会四下散布，阿尔。
谢谢你的啤酒。
No, I'm not going to spread it 
around, Al. Thank you for the beer.

1771
01:52:12,750 --> 01:52:14,450
晚安，皮兰特小姐。
Good night, Miss Pilant.

1772
01:52:18,430 --> 01:52:21,390
好吧，现在让我们来谈谈《玫瑰经》这事。
All right. Let's get at this rosary thing.

1773
01:52:21,400 --> 01:52:24,560
前面的证词说你妻子以《玫瑰经》向你起誓，
It's been testified that your wife 
swore to you on a rosary...

1774
01:52:24,570 --> 01:52:27,100
说她遭到巴尼・奎尔强奸。
that she'd been raped by Barney Quill.

1775
01:52:27,100 --> 01:52:30,250
是你要求你妻子以《玫瑰经》起誓的吗？
Did you ask your wife to swear on a rosary?

1776
01:52:30,840 --> 01:52:34,140
当时我妻子表现得歇斯底里，说话语无伦次。
My wife was hysterical.
She wasn't making much sense.

1777
01:52:34,140 --> 01:52:37,280
我想要是我让她以《玫瑰经》的名义起誓，
I thought if I asked her to take 
an oath on a rosary...

1778
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:40,280
或许可以使她平静下来，
使她脑子变得清楚一点。
it might serve to calm her, 
make her think more clearly.

1779
01:52:40,280 --> 01:52:42,380
《玫瑰经》有用吗？
Did the rosary help?

1780
01:52:42,380 --> 01:52:44,980
她能够开始告诉我
所发生事情的详细情况了。
She was able to tell me 
in detail what had happened.

1781
01:52:44,990 --> 01:52:48,250
好的，接着说。
然后你做了什么，中尉？
All right. Go on from there.
What did you do then, Lieutenant?

1782
01:52:49,060 --> 01:52:51,420
唔，我…
Well, I--

1783
01:52:51,430 --> 01:52:54,930
我让她躺到床上，
我去找了块冷的布…
I had her lie on the bed, 
and I got some cold cloths...

1784
01:52:54,930 --> 01:52:56,920
敷在她头上。
for her head.

1785
01:52:57,130 --> 01:53:00,960
然后，呃…噢，对了，
我给了她一杯白兰地。
And, uh-- Oh, yes. 
I gave her a drink of brandy.

1786
01:53:02,900 --> 01:53:06,540
过了一会儿，她安静了下来，
慢慢地睡着了。
After a while, she became calm, 
seemed to go to sleep.

1787
01:53:07,610 --> 01:53:10,010
然后我走到壁橱旁，
Then I went to the closet...

1788
01:53:10,010 --> 01:53:12,260
取出了我的枪，装上子弹。
I got my gun, and I loaded it.

1789
01:53:12,260 --> 01:53:15,280
你当时想着要去杀巴尼・奎尔吗？
Was it in your mind to kill Barney Quill?

1790
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:16,540
没有。
No.

1791
01:53:16,550 --> 01:53:19,640
那么你为什么会走到壁橱旁，
取出枪并装上子弹呢？
Then why did you go to the closet 
and get your gun and load it?

1792
01:53:19,650 --> 01:53:23,260
我知道我得去奎尔的酒吧，
我想我可能会用得着。
I knew I had to go to Quill's place.
I thought I might need it.

1793
01:53:23,260 --> 01:53:24,960
为什么？
Why?

1794
01:53:25,260 --> 01:53:27,960
我知道奎尔先生在吧台后面藏着好多枪。
I knew Mr. Quill kept guns behind the bar.

1795
01:53:27,960 --> 01:53:29,730
我害怕他会向我开枪。
I was afraid he might shoot me.

1796
01:53:29,730 --> 01:53:31,730
你做什么会使他向你开枪？
Might shoot you if you did what?

1797
01:53:31,730 --> 01:53:34,730
你准备去干什么？
What were you going to do?

1798
01:53:34,740 --> 01:53:36,970
我不太肯定。
I'm not sure.

1799
01:53:36,970 --> 01:53:39,740
我记得当时我想的是…
I remember having some idea...

1800
01:53:39,740 --> 01:53:42,110
先找到他，
of finding him...

1801
01:53:42,110 --> 01:53:45,260
然后抓住他，接着再叫警察。
and holding him while I call the police.

1802
01:53:45,260 --> 01:53:47,150
唔，那位先生，那位叫什么来着…
Well, that Mr. Whatshisname--

1803
01:53:47,150 --> 01:53:50,310
对了，莱蒙先生，
他是旅游公园那儿的治安官。
Mr. Lemon at the tourist court there, 
he was a deputy sheriff.

1804
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:52,820
你为什么没有叫上他跟你一起去？
Why didn't you get him to go with you?

1805
01:53:52,820 --> 01:53:54,950
也许是因为一直以来，他看上去只是…
Maybe because he always seemed to be just...

1806
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:57,550
公园的一个老管理员。
the old caretaker of the park.

1807
01:53:58,530 --> 01:54:02,090
也许是因为我当时除了想
找到巴尼・奎尔，脑子里…
Maybe because I wasn't thinking 
about anything too clearly...

1808
01:54:02,100 --> 01:54:04,260
想不太清其它的事情。
except finding Barney Quill.

1809
01:54:04,260 --> 01:54:08,030
在你去酒吧之前，你为什么
不拿起电话，给警察打电话？
Why didn't you go to a phone, call 
the police before you went to the bar?

1810
01:54:08,040 --> 01:54:10,300
我不知道。
I don't know.

1811
01:54:10,310 --> 01:54:13,600
我可能有点晕了，
I was in sort of a daze.

1812
01:54:13,610 --> 01:54:16,610
看到那么可怕的事情发生在我妻子身上。
It was a horrible thing to see 
what had been done to my wife.

1813
01:54:16,610 --> 01:54:18,870
你说可能有点晕了，
Now, you say you were in sort of a daze.

1814
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:22,640
那么当你到达酒吧时，
你看到酒吧里有好多人吗？
When you got to the bar, 
did you see that the bar was crowded?

1815
01:54:24,650 --> 01:54:28,050
我没注意到酒吧里的任何人，
I didn't see anyone at the bar...

1816
01:54:28,060 --> 01:54:30,950
除了巴尼・奎尔。
except Barney Quill.

1817
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:34,420
- 他是我看见的唯一一个人。
- 他在干什么？
- He was the only person I saw.
- What was he doing?

1818
01:54:35,260 --> 01:54:39,100
我想他就站在那儿，在吧台后面。
I think he was just standing there behind the bar.

1819
01:54:39,100 --> 01:54:43,360
那么他有没有想要取枪威胁你呢？
Now, did he make a threatening move to get a gun?

1820
01:54:43,370 --> 01:54:46,900
我不知道，可能吧，我不知道。
I don't know. May have. I don't know.

1821
01:54:46,910 --> 01:54:49,940
好吧，你说你去那里找他，
All right. Now, you say you went there to find him...

1822
01:54:49,940 --> 01:54:51,980
想抓住他交给警察。
to hold him for the police.

1823
01:54:51,980 --> 01:54:54,280
那又为什么向他开枪？
Why did you shoot him?

1824
01:54:55,750 --> 01:54:58,260
我不记得向他开枪了。
I don't remember shooting him.

1825
01:54:59,090 --> 01:55:02,090
在你离开酒吧时，
你记不记得阿尔方斯・帕盖特…
Now, when you left the bar, 
do you remember Alphonse Paquette...

1826
01:55:02,090 --> 01:55:04,160
走向你，想阻止你说：
coming up to you and stopping you and saying...

1827
01:55:04,160 --> 01:55:07,190
“出了这样的事，你最好还是别跑。”
你回答他：
"You'd better not run away from this,"
and you replied...

1828
01:55:07,200 --> 01:55:09,420
“你也想吃几颗吗，小子？”
"You want some too, buster?"

1829
01:55:09,430 --> 01:55:11,100
还记得吗？
Remember that?

1830
01:55:11,600 --> 01:55:16,260
我只有些模糊的印象
好像是有人跟我说过话，
I seem to have a vague recollection 
of somebody speaking to me...

1831
01:55:17,310 --> 01:55:21,040
但是我不记得他对我说了什么，
或我对他说了什么。
but I don't remember what I said 
or what was said to me.

1832
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:24,480
你什么时候意识到你开枪打了奎尔？
When did you realize that you'd shot Quill?

1833
01:55:26,710 --> 01:55:29,310
我去厨房取水喝，
I was getting a drink of water.

1834
01:55:29,320 --> 01:55:32,480
因为我记得我的嗓子干得生疼。
I remember my throat was so dry it hurt.

1835
01:55:33,820 --> 01:55:37,460
当我放下玻璃杯，看见那把抢
放在厨房的水槽上，
And when I put the glass down, 
I saw the gun on the kitchen sink...

1836
01:55:37,460 --> 01:55:39,720
在水龙头旁边。
beside the tap.

1837
01:55:39,730 --> 01:55:41,830
我发现枪是空的。
I noticed the gun was empty.

1838
01:55:42,730 --> 01:55:45,730
我想让你给法庭和陪审团演示一下，
Now, I'd like you to show the court and jury...

1839
01:55:47,500 --> 01:55:50,690
你怎么知道这把枪是空的。
just how you knew this gun was empty.

1840
01:55:50,710 --> 01:55:53,300
嗯，要是这个小部件…
Well, this gadget here...

1841
01:55:53,310 --> 01:55:57,270
处于这个位置，那么你就知道
你打完了最后一发子弹。
when it sticks up, 
you know the last round's been fired.

1842
01:55:57,280 --> 01:56:02,480
曼尼昂中尉，在你开枪的那个晚上，
你爱你妻子吗？
On the night of the shooting,
did you love your wife?

1843
01:56:02,480 --> 01:56:06,120
- 当然，先生。
- 你现在仍然爱她吗？
- Yes, sir.
- Do you still love her?

1844
01:56:09,260 --> 01:56:11,560
非常爱。
Very much.

1845
01:56:11,660 --> 01:56:13,890
证人是你的了，丹色先生。
The witness is yours, Mr. Dancer.

1846
01:56:13,900 --> 01:56:19,460
曼尼昂中尉，你杀过多少人？
How many men have you killed?

1847
01:56:19,470 --> 01:56:21,900
喂，拜托了！
Now, wait a minute!

1848
01:56:21,900 --> 01:56:25,340
法官大人，一个人的战争记录――
就曼尼昂中尉的情况而言，是一份出色的记录――
Your Honor, a man's war record--
in Lt. Manion's case, a great record--

1849
01:56:25,340 --> 01:56:27,470
显然不应该用来反对他。
certainly shouldn't be used against him.

1850
01:56:27,480 --> 01:56:30,510
法官大人，我和诸位一样，也非常爱国，
I'm as patriotic as the next man...

1851
01:56:30,510 --> 01:56:33,140
但是简单的事实是：
战争会改变一个人，
but the simple truth is, 
war can condition a man...

1852
01:56:33,150 --> 01:56:35,410
让他变得嗜杀。
to killing other men.

1853
01:56:35,420 --> 01:56:38,110
我只是想判断一下
中尉因战争而改变的程度，
I simply want to determine 
how conditioned the lieutenant may be...

1854
01:56:38,120 --> 01:56:41,680
是否轻易就用武器对付其他人。
to the use of firearms on other human beings.

1855
01:56:41,690 --> 01:56:45,640
我也不喜欢这个问题，比格勒先生，
但是我也看不出有什么理由不让他问。
I don't like the question, Mr. Biegler,
but I don't see how I can exclude it.

1856
01:56:45,660 --> 01:56:47,460
让他回答吧。
Let him answer.

1857
01:56:47,460 --> 01:56:51,260
我知道在朝鲜时，我至少杀过四个人――
I know I killed at least four men in Korea--

1858
01:56:51,260 --> 01:56:53,260
三个是用手雷，
three with a hand grenade...

1859
01:56:53,260 --> 01:56:55,560
一个是用我的自动武器。
and one with my service automatic.

1860
01:56:55,570 --> 01:56:59,470
也许我还杀过其他人，
一个战士并不总能知道。
I may have killed others.
A soldier doesn't always know.

1861
01:56:59,470 --> 01:57:01,800
那么中尉，在这些杀人行动中，
Now, Lieutenant, in these acts of killing...

1862
01:57:01,810 --> 01:57:05,540
你有没有发生过遗忘的现象呢，
就像你在杀死巴尼・奎尔时那样？
did you ever have a lapse of memory such 
as you had when you killed Barney Quill?

1863
01:57:05,550 --> 01:57:08,740
- 没有，先生。
- 那么在战场上，你有没有发生过遗忘现象？
- No, sir.
- Did you ever have one during battle?

1864
01:57:08,750 --> 01:57:10,410
- 没有，先生。
- 你有没有经常处于…
- No, sir.
- Were you ever submitted...

1865
01:57:10,420 --> 01:57:13,260
枪林弹雨之下，经常连续几个小时大汗淋漓，
to a constant barrage, 
constantly in a sweat for many hours...

1866
01:57:13,260 --> 01:57:15,550
- 经常不停地进攻和防守？
- 无数次。
- constantly under attack or attacking?
- Many times.

1867
01:57:15,560 --> 01:57:19,020
你是否曾因震弹症、战斗疲劳症、
神经官能症、或精神病接受过治疗？
Were you ever treated for shell shock,
battle fatigue, neuroses or psychoses?

1868
01:57:19,030 --> 01:57:21,290
- 没有，先生。
- 在战争期间，你有没有经历过…
- No, sir.
- Did you ever experience...

1869
01:57:21,300 --> 01:57:23,990
任何异常的精神状态？
any unusual mental state during the war?

1870
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,330
唔，我的确记得有一种非常强烈的冲动。
Well, I do remember having one great urge.

1871
01:57:26,330 --> 01:57:29,770
- 那是什么？
- 离开这鬼地方回家。
- What was that?
- To get the hell out and go home.

1872
01:57:30,270 --> 01:57:32,930
你最好还是别忘了你现在…
You would do well to consider the seriousness...

1873
01:57:32,940 --> 01:57:34,740
所处境遇的严重性。
of the situation you're in.

1874
01:57:34,740 --> 01:57:37,830
- 对不起，法官大人。
- 我倒是和中尉有同感，
- I'm sorry, Your Honor.
- I sympathize with the lieutenant.

1875
01:57:37,850 --> 01:57:41,940
我估计他现在对于离开监狱，
大概也有类似的冲动。
I expect he has the same feeling 
about getting out of jail.

1876
01:57:41,950 --> 01:57:44,260
我的要点是，中尉，在你参与战争的整个期间，
But the main point here is that at no time...

1877
01:57:44,260 --> 01:57:46,910
没有任何一刻记录过你有精神方面的异常，
during your war service did you have
a record of mental disturbance.

1878
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:49,260
你总是处于完全清醒的状态。
You were always in complete possession 
of your faculties.

1879
01:57:49,260 --> 01:57:51,690
是的，先生，你说得对。
Yes, sir. That's right.

1880
01:57:51,690 --> 01:57:54,590
- 没有问题了。
- 我也不用再质询了，法官大人。
- No more questions.
- No redirect, Your Honor.

1881
01:57:54,600 --> 01:57:57,130
请退席。传你的下一位证人。
Step down, please. Call your next witness.

1882
01:57:57,130 --> 01:57:59,980
我们传劳拉・曼尼昂上证人席。
We call Laura Manion to the stand.

1883
01:58:11,980 --> 01:58:15,280
- 上楼梯后朝右拐。
- 谢谢。
- Up these stairs and to the right.
- Thanks.

1884
01:58:21,290 --> 01:58:24,020
当你告诉你丈夫所发生的事之后，
隔了多久他…
How long after you told 
your husband what had happened...

1885
01:58:24,030 --> 01:58:26,260
离开的车房？
did he leave the trailer?

1886
01:58:26,260 --> 01:58:28,350
我不知道确切有多久，
I don't know exactly.

1887
01:58:28,360 --> 01:58:30,120
一切都模模糊糊的。
Everything was kind of fuzzy.

1888
01:58:30,130 --> 01:58:32,890
我头很晕，我躺到了床上。
I was faint, and I laid down on the bed.

1889
01:58:32,900 --> 01:58:35,070
他坐在我旁边。
He sat beside me.

1890
01:58:35,070 --> 01:58:38,100
我隐约记得他起身离开。
I vaguely remember his getting up and going out.

1891
01:58:38,110 --> 01:58:40,800
我也记得我当时想，
他是不是叫医生去了，
I remember wondering 
if he was going for a doctor...

1892
01:58:40,810 --> 01:58:43,110
后来他就回来了。
and then he came back in.

1893
01:58:43,110 --> 01:58:45,980
感觉就像是只有几秒钟，但是肯定不止。
It seemed like just a few seconds, 
but it must have been longer.

1894
01:58:45,980 --> 01:58:48,470
我可能睡过去了。
I must've gone to sleep.

1895
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:51,480
当他回来后，他坐在我床边，
When he came back in, he sat on the bed...

1896
01:58:51,490 --> 01:58:53,610
手里拿着把枪。
and he had a gun in his hand.

1897
01:58:53,620 --> 01:58:56,260
我说：“你要干什么？”
And I said, "What are you going to do?"

1898
01:58:56,720 --> 01:58:59,820
他说：“我想我已经干了，
And he said, "I think I've already done it.

1899
01:58:59,830 --> 01:59:02,120
我想我杀了巴尼・奎尔。”
I think I've killed Barney Quill."

1900
01:59:02,130 --> 01:59:05,720
你能肯定他说的不是“我杀了巴尼・奎尔”？
Are you sure he didn't say, 
"I've killed Barney Quill"?

1901
01:59:05,730 --> 01:59:08,320
肯定，我记得很清楚，
No, I remember distinctly.

1902
01:59:08,340 --> 01:59:10,330
“我想我杀了巴尼・奎尔。”
"I think I've killed Barney Quill."

1903
01:59:10,340 --> 01:59:12,400
然后你干什么了？
Then what did you do?

1904
01:59:12,410 --> 01:59:16,770
我用双手抱着他，开始哭了起来，
I put my arms around him and began to cry...

1905
01:59:16,780 --> 01:59:19,780
我说：“你最好去找莱蒙先生。”
and I said, "You'd better go to Mr. Lemon."

1906
01:59:19,780 --> 01:59:21,870
我丈夫说：“我忘了这个。”
And my husband said, "I forgot about that."

1907
01:59:21,880 --> 01:59:24,710
他什么意思？他忘了什么？
What did he mean? Forgot about what?

1908
01:59:24,720 --> 01:59:28,310
他的意思是他忘了
莱蒙先生也是一名治安官。
He meant he'd forgotten 
Mr. Lemon was a deputy sheriff.

1909
01:59:28,320 --> 01:59:31,260
他说：“好的，我去向莱蒙先生自首。”
And he said, "Yes, I'll go 
turn myself in to Mr. Lemon."

1910
01:59:31,260 --> 01:59:32,620
好的，知道了。
Yes, I see.

1911
01:59:32,630 --> 01:59:36,030
法官大人，就此证人
目前我没有进一步的问题了。
Your Honor, I have no other 
direct questions at this time.

1912
01:59:36,030 --> 01:59:39,120
但是因为我敢肯定，
各位很难想象到一条小狗…
But since I'm sure it's difficult 
to visualize the part...

1913
01:59:39,130 --> 01:59:41,900
在那晚所起的作用，
a little dog played on this night...

1914
01:59:41,900 --> 01:59:45,730
所以我希望给我几分钟，
向法庭展示这只出色的小动物。
I should like a few minutes to show 
the court this remarkable little animal.

1915
01:59:45,740 --> 01:59:47,730
公诉方反对吗？
Do the people object?

1916
01:59:47,740 --> 01:59:49,740
我可以肯定，要是我们反对的话，法官大人，
I'm sure that if we raise 
an objection, Your Honor...

1917
01:59:49,740 --> 01:59:53,450
比格勒先生又会宣称
我们敌视所有幼小的、毛茸茸的动物。
Mr. Biegler will declare that we are
haters of all small, furry animals.

1918
01:59:53,680 --> 01:59:57,140
幸亏那个造物不会开口说话。
A creature that cannot talk 
will be a welcome relief.

1919
01:59:57,150 --> 01:59:59,260
把狗带进来。
Bring in the dog.

1920
01:59:59,260 --> 02:00:04,280
谢谢，大人。请庭警带狗进来好吗？
Thank you, sir. Will the deputy 
bring in the dog, please?

1921
02:00:17,060 --> 02:00:19,730
把他放在那儿吧。
You can put him right there.

1922
02:00:20,840 --> 02:00:23,740
嗨，毛毛！过来！过来！
Hey, Muff!. Come on!

1923
02:00:24,410 --> 02:00:26,660
真乖！
That's a boy.

1924
02:00:27,260 --> 02:00:31,240
现在我问曼尼昂夫人要个便携灯给小狗。
And now I'll ask Mrs. Manion 
to bring a flashlight for the dog.

1925
02:00:41,960 --> 02:00:46,570
我要法庭注意，小狗把灯打开了。
I'll ask the court to notice 
that the dog turned on the light.

1926
02:00:55,440 --> 02:00:58,810
很容易看出来，毛毛不知道谁是他的敌人。
It's easy to see that Muff doesn't know 
who his enemies are.

1927
02:00:58,810 --> 02:01:01,070
- 把狗带出去吧。
- 好的，大人。
- Remove the dog, please.
- Yes, sir.

1928
02:01:01,080 --> 02:01:03,940
- 证人回到证人席。
- 走吧，毛毛。
- The witness will resume the stand.
- There we go, Muff.

1929
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:11,550
曼尼昂夫人，我要祝贺你有
这样一只训练有素的宠物。
May I congratulate you 
on your well trained pet.

1930
02:01:11,560 --> 02:01:14,590
我也想说，我很高兴看到你今天不再…
May I also say I'm pleased to see 
you're not today...

1931
02:01:14,600 --> 02:01:16,960
将你可爱的头发藏在帽子下面了。
hiding your lovely hair under a hat.

1932
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:20,760
法官大人，从兰辛来的检查总长助理
算是在大献殷勤呢，
Your Honor, is the assistant attorney 
general from Lansing pitching woo...

1933
02:01:20,770 --> 02:01:24,600
- 还算是在交叉质询证人？
- 让我们切入正题吧。
- or is he going to cross-examine?
- Let's get on with it.

1934
02:01:24,610 --> 02:01:27,040
曼尼昂夫人，结婚之前你的职业是什么？
Mrs. Manion, what was your occupation 
before you were married?

1935
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:30,040
- 家庭主妇。
- 那么之前你结过婚？
- Housewife.
- Then you've been married before?

1936
02:01:30,040 --> 02:01:34,510
- 是的，一次。
- 我猜你第一个丈夫去世了？
- Yes, once.
- I suppose your first husband died?

1937
02:01:34,520 --> 02:01:35,840
没有。
No.

1938
02:01:35,850 --> 02:01:38,650
你是和你第一个丈夫离婚后
才和曼尼昂中尉结婚的吗？
Did you divorce your first husband 
to marry Lt. Manion?

1939
02:01:38,650 --> 02:01:40,450
法官大人，如果对方律师想知道曼尼昂夫人的…
Your Honor, if counsel wants 
to know the grounds...

1940
02:01:40,450 --> 02:01:42,820
离婚理由的话，就让他直截了当问好了。
for Mrs. Manion's divorce, 
let him ask that question.

1941
02:01:42,820 --> 02:01:44,650
你离婚的理由是什么？
What were the grounds for divorce?

1942
02:01:44,660 --> 02:01:47,820
- 精神折磨。
- 自然。那么你离婚后多久…
- Mental cruelty.
- Naturally. And how long after...

1943
02:01:47,830 --> 02:01:50,560
和曼尼昂中尉结的婚？
your divorce was it that 
you married Lt. Manion?

1944
02:01:50,570 --> 02:01:52,390
呃…我不太确定。
I'm not sure.

1945
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:55,560
我可以为丹瑟先生替证人回忆一下吗？
May I refresh the witness' memory 
for Mr. Dancer?

1946
02:01:55,570 --> 02:01:57,800
- 愿意洗耳恭听。
- 我相信她告诉过我，
- By all means.
- I believe she told me...

1947
02:01:57,810 --> 02:02:01,140
他们在离婚三天之后结的婚。
that they were married three days 
after the divorce.

1948
02:02:01,140 --> 02:02:03,510
谢谢，比格勒先生。
是这样的吗，曼尼昂夫人？
Thank you, Mr. Biegler. 
Is that correct, Mrs. Manion?

1949
02:02:03,510 --> 02:02:04,440
是的。
Yes.

1950
02:02:04,450 --> 02:02:07,640
那么除非你闪电般地就完成了恋爱结婚，
Then unless yours was a whirlwind courtship...

1951
02:02:07,650 --> 02:02:10,840
你在离婚之前，就一定已经认识了
曼尼昂中尉，是吗？
you must have known Lt. Manion 
before your divorce, did you?

1952
02:02:10,850 --> 02:02:11,840
是的。
Yes.

1953
02:02:11,850 --> 02:02:16,580
曼尼昂夫人，你的宗教信仰是什么？
Mrs. Manion, what is your religious affiliation?

1954
02:02:16,590 --> 02:02:20,060
- 我是天主教徒。
- 规规矩矩的天主教徒？
- I'm a Catholic.
- Catholic in good standing?

1955
02:02:20,060 --> 02:02:22,060
噢，不，因为离婚，你知道。
Well, no. The divorce, you know.

1956
02:02:22,060 --> 02:02:24,920
你是说因为离婚和再婚，
你被逐出了教会？
You mean you were excommunicated 
because of the divorce and remarriage.

1957
02:02:24,930 --> 02:02:26,060
是的。
Yes.

1958
02:02:26,070 --> 02:02:28,860
曼尼昂夫人，在你看来一个天主教徒，
Mrs. Manion, wouldn't you say that a Catholic...

1959
02:02:28,870 --> 02:02:32,600
如果她可以轻快地无视她的教会的
最主要的规定之一，
who can blithely ignore one of
the cardinal rules of her church...

1960
02:02:32,610 --> 02:02:36,260
那么她是否也很容易
无视在一件教会的人造物品――
could also easily ignore an oath 
taken on one of its artifacts...

1961
02:02:36,260 --> 02:02:39,240
比如说《玫瑰经》――上起的誓呢？
say, an oath taken on a rosary?

1962
02:02:40,260 --> 02:02:42,580
我不认为那是事实。
I don't think that's true.

1963
02:02:42,580 --> 02:02:46,550
那么你不认为这样一个人的诚实性很不可靠吗？
Wouldn't you think there'd be some doubt 
about the integrity of such a person?

1964
02:02:46,850 --> 02:02:48,450
我不知道。
I don't know.

1965
02:02:48,860 --> 02:02:51,590
我所知道的是《玫瑰经》的确对我意味着什么。
All I know is the rosary means something to me.

1966
02:02:51,690 --> 02:02:56,030
知道了。那么我问一点其它的事情。
I see. Well, I'll pass on to something else.

1967
02:02:56,030 --> 02:02:58,300
曼尼昂夫人，你作证说你丈夫…
Mrs. Manion, you testified that your husband...

1968
02:02:58,300 --> 02:03:00,630
在发生枪击的那个晚上，工作到很晚才回家。
came home late from his work 
on the night of the shooting.

1969
02:03:00,640 --> 02:03:02,640
对他回来晚了，你是不是有点生气？
Were you a little angry about his being late?

1970
02:03:02,640 --> 02:03:06,300
- 我想我是有点不愉快。
- 你们吵架了吗？
- I guess I was a little put out.
- Did you have an argument?

1971
02:03:06,310 --> 02:03:08,310
没有大吵，只有一点。
Not much. A little.

1972
02:03:08,310 --> 02:03:10,570
当你离开车房去旅店，
When you left the trailer to go to the inn...

1973
02:03:10,580 --> 02:03:13,700
- 你丈夫知道你走了吗？
- 他睡着了。
- did your husband know you were going?
- He was asleep.

1974
02:03:13,710 --> 02:03:15,980
你没让他知道就走了，部分原因…
Was part of your reason for going 
without his knowledge...

1975
02:03:15,980 --> 02:03:18,580
是不是因为你很恼火？
because you were vexed?

1976
02:03:18,890 --> 02:03:22,920
唔，我熨了一整天衣服，我……
Well, I'd been ironing all day, and I--

1977
02:03:22,920 --> 02:03:25,520
- 是的，我想是这样。
- 法官大人，对方律师…
- Yes, I guess that's true.
- Your Honor, the counsel...

1978
02:03:25,530 --> 02:03:27,920
故意挡住我的视线，不让我看到证人。
has deliberately cut off my view of the witness.

1979
02:03:27,930 --> 02:03:31,730
对不起，比格勒先生，
我没想着要干预你向她发暗号。
I'm sorry, Mr. Biegler. I wouldn't want 
to interfere with your signals to her.

1980
02:03:31,730 --> 02:03:34,390
我反对这一结论，说我向证人发暗号。
I object to the implication 
I was signaling the witness.

1981
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:37,490
这是我见过的最卑鄙的法庭上的伎俩。
This is the shabbiest courtroom trick 
I've ever seen.

1982
02:03:37,510 --> 02:03:41,770
- 你还太嫩，比格勒先生。
- 法官大人，我请求法庭就我的反对做出裁决。
- You haven't lived, Mr. Biegler.
- I ask for a rule on my objection.

1983
02:03:41,780 --> 02:03:44,370
丹瑟先生，你能否注意一下，别挡在…
Mr. Dancer, will you be careful 
not to place yourself...

1984
02:03:44,380 --> 02:03:46,470
比格勒先生和他的证人之间？
between Mr. Biegler and his witness?

1985
02:03:46,480 --> 02:03:48,550
当然，法官大人。
Of course, Your Honor.

1986
02:03:48,550 --> 02:03:51,450
- 还有别的吗，比格勒先生？
- 你再做一次，
- Anything else, Mr. Biegler?
- You do it once more...

1987
02:03:51,450 --> 02:03:55,890
我会把你一拳揍出去，
直到你落入苏必利尔湖中心。
I'll punch you all the way out 
into the middle of Lake Superior.

1988
02:03:55,890 --> 02:03:58,150
先生们，先生们，
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.

1989
02:03:58,160 --> 02:04:00,450
这种吵闹必须终止。
This rowing has got to stop.

1990
02:04:00,460 --> 02:04:04,500
你们任何一位下次再有这样
不合时宜的发言，那我就不客气了。
The next one of you that speaks 
out of turn will have me to deal with.

1991
02:04:04,500 --> 02:04:06,830
现在继续你的交叉质询。
Get on with your cross-examination.

1992
02:04:06,830 --> 02:04:10,170
如果你丈夫是醒着的话，
你还会去旅店吗？
Would you have gone to the inn 
if your husband had been awake?

1993
02:04:10,170 --> 02:04:13,670
- 他可能会和我一起去。
- 但是你还会一个人去吗？
- He probably would have gone with me.
- But would you have gone alone?

1994
02:04:13,670 --> 02:04:18,010
- 不会，要是他不让我去的话。
- 那他会不会不让你去呢？
- Not if he didn't want me to.
- Would he have not wanted you to?

1995
02:04:18,010 --> 02:04:20,710
我不能肯定。我不知道怎样回答。
I'm not sure. I don't know how to answer that.

1996
02:04:20,720 --> 02:04:23,410
你曾经在夜里一个人
去过“雷鸣湾旅店”吗？
Had you ever gone to 
the Thunder Bay Inn, or...

1997
02:04:23,420 --> 02:04:26,420
或雷鸣湾的其它地方吗？
elsewhere in Thunder Bay alone at night?

1998
02:04:26,420 --> 02:04:29,750
- 去过，有几次。
- 你丈夫知道你去过吗？
- Yes, sometimes.
- Did your husband know you were going?

1999
02:04:29,760 --> 02:04:32,990
不都知道。他睡得很早，
Not always. He goes to sleep early...

2000
02:04:32,990 --> 02:04:35,820
有的时候我有点心神不宁。
and sometimes I'm restless.

2001
02:04:35,830 --> 02:04:39,730
- 在这种情况下你会去哪儿？
- 我会沿着湖边散一会儿步，
- Where did you go on these occasions?
- I'd take a walk by the lake, or...

2002
02:04:39,730 --> 02:04:43,290
或是去玩宾果游戏，也许去旅店。
go into the bingo place, maybe to the inn.

2003
02:04:43,300 --> 02:04:46,100
你去和另外的男人约会过吗？
You ever go to meet another man?

2004
02:04:46,110 --> 02:04:48,160
没有，没约会过。我从不那样。
No, I didn't. I never did that.

2005
02:04:48,180 --> 02:04:51,140
曼尼昂夫人，你是说
像你这样一个可爱的女人，
You mean to say, Mrs. Manion, 
a lovely women like yourself...

2006
02:04:51,150 --> 02:04:54,650
一个迷人的、孤独的、心神不宁
的女人，一次也没有和……
attractive to men, lonely, restless, 
that you never once met--

2007
02:04:54,650 --> 02:04:57,740
反对，法官大人。证人已经回答了
关于其他男人的问题，
Objection, Your Honor. The witness has 
answered the question about other men.

2008
02:04:57,750 --> 02:05:00,620
对方律师现在是在
向陪审团作隐匿的暗示。
The counsel is now making 
a veiled suggestion to the jury.

2009
02:05:00,620 --> 02:05:02,710
我撤回问题。
I withdraw the question.

2010
02:05:02,720 --> 02:05:07,260
曼尼昂夫人，在这些偶尔发生在
夜幕下的短途旅游过程中，
Mrs. Manion, on these occasional 
excursions into the night...

2011
02:05:07,260 --> 02:05:09,890
你总是独来独往的吗？
did you always go and return home alone?

2012
02:05:09,900 --> 02:05:11,430
当然。
Of course.

2013
02:05:11,430 --> 02:05:13,800
可是曼尼昂夫人，你前面的证词说…
Mrs. Manion, you testified 
that the reason you got...

2014
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:17,530
你上巴尼・奎尔车的原因
是由于你害怕一个人回家。
into Barney Quill's car was because
you were afraid to go home alone.

2015
02:05:17,540 --> 02:05:19,600
为什么这一晚上那么特别，让你害怕了呢？
Why were you so frightened on this night?

2016
02:05:19,610 --> 02:05:24,140
我说过那是因为他告诉我
有黑熊在附近出没。
I said that it was because he told me 
bears had been seen around.

2017
02:05:24,150 --> 02:05:26,440
那是你第一次听说…
Was this the first time you heard that...

2018
02:05:26,450 --> 02:05:28,740
雷鸣湾有黑熊四处觅食吗？
bears came around Thunder Bay for scraps?

2019
02:05:28,750 --> 02:05:31,410
- 不是。
- 你以前见到过黑熊吗？
- No.
- Had you seen the bears before?

2020
02:05:31,420 --> 02:05:32,480
见过。
Yes.

2021
02:05:32,490 --> 02:05:35,090
哦，这只是你头一次感到害怕了？
Oh, this was just the first time 
you were afraid of them.

2022
02:05:35,090 --> 02:05:37,420
不，我一直感到害怕的。
No, I was always afraid of them.

2023
02:05:37,430 --> 02:05:40,320
噢，这只是你头一次感到如此害怕，
以至于让一个男人…
Oh, this was just the first time 
you were enough afraid to allow...

2024
02:05:40,330 --> 02:05:43,290
带你回家，尽管这只是
你众多的夜晚潜行中的一次。
a man to take you home 
from one of your evening prowls.

2025
02:05:43,290 --> 02:05:46,760
反对，用“潜行”这个词会误导陪审团。
Objection. Use of the word "prowls."
Meant to mislead the jury.

2026
02:05:46,770 --> 02:05:49,930
- 反对有效。
- 好吧，我道歉，曼尼昂夫人，
- Sustained.
- I apologize, Mrs. Manion.

2027
02:05:49,940 --> 02:05:52,800
我没有想暗示你是个女猎手的意思。
I didn't mean to imply that 
you were a huntress.

2028
02:05:52,810 --> 02:05:55,570
是不是你头一次感到如此害怕，
以至于让一个男人…
Was this the first time that
you were enough afraid to allow a man...

2029
02:05:55,580 --> 02:05:58,870
带你回家，尽管这只是
你众多的夜晚漫步中的一次？
to take you home 
from one of your evening walks?

2030
02:05:58,880 --> 02:06:01,810
呃，不是这样的，
Well, it wasn't just that.

2031
02:06:01,820 --> 02:06:03,620
- 是……
- 噢，别这样，曼尼昂夫人，
- It was--
- Oh, come now, Mrs. Manion.

2032
02:06:03,620 --> 02:06:06,350
你应该能够直接了当地回答这个问题，
这是个足够简单的问题。
You should be able to answer that 
straight off. That's a simple question.

2033
02:06:06,350 --> 02:06:09,120
法官大人，对方律师总是打断证人的回答，
Your Honor, how can the witness 
answer straight off...

2034
02:06:09,120 --> 02:06:11,420
这样如何能让她直接了当地回答问题？
when the counsel keeps interrupting the answer?

2035
02:06:11,430 --> 02:06:14,690
在我看来，证人是回答得有点慢，比格勒先生。
The witness seemed a little 
slow to me, Mr. Biegler.

2036
02:06:14,700 --> 02:06:17,730
但是，在她完整回答完之前，别打断她。
However, let her complete her answers 
before you interrupt.

2037
02:06:17,730 --> 02:06:20,300
当然，法官大人。但是总的来说，
比格勒先生的反对，
Of course, Your Honor. In any case, 
Mr. Biegler's objection...

2038
02:06:20,300 --> 02:06:23,390
给了曼尼昂夫人足够多的思考时间，
好让她想出个答案回答我的问题。
has given Mr. Manion sufficient time 
to think of an answer to my question.

2039
02:06:23,400 --> 02:06:25,400
你已经想出个答案了，是吗？
You've thought of one, haven't you?

2040
02:06:25,410 --> 02:06:28,940
我想说的是，我当时不想得罪奎尔先生，
What I was going to say was that 
I didn't want to offend Mr. Quill...

2041
02:06:28,940 --> 02:06:32,260
不想让他以为我怕他或不喜欢他，
by making him think that I was
afraid of him or didn't like him.

2042
02:06:32,260 --> 02:06:35,840
当我丈夫和我过去在他的酒吧时，
他对我们也很友善。
He's been very pleasant to my husband
and me when we'd been in his bar.

2043
02:06:35,850 --> 02:06:37,940
这答案很棒，曼尼昂夫人，真的很棒。
That's very good, Mrs. Manion. 
Very good, indeed.

2044
02:06:37,950 --> 02:06:41,020
- 法官大人，拜托！
- 公诉方律师…
- Your Honor, please.
- The attorney for the people...

2045
02:06:41,020 --> 02:06:43,890
请你提出论点而不是做出评论。
will reserve his comments for the arguments.

2046
02:06:43,890 --> 02:06:47,190
那我问你这个问题，曼尼昂夫人。
I will ask you this question, Mrs. Manion.

2047
02:06:47,190 --> 02:06:52,360
这是你第一次在夜晚
坐进巴尼・奎尔的车里吗？
Was this the first time you had been 
in Barney Quill's car at night?

2048
02:06:54,800 --> 02:06:58,270
曼尼昂夫人，你听清问题了吗？
Mrs. Manion, did you hear the question?

2049
02:06:58,270 --> 02:07:00,740
是的，我听清了。
Yes, I heard.

2050
02:07:00,740 --> 02:07:03,740
是的，这是第一次。
Yes, it was the first time.

2051
02:07:03,740 --> 02:07:06,540
你能稍微提高点声音吗，曼尼昂夫人？
Would you raise your voice a little, Mrs. Manion?

2052
02:07:06,550 --> 02:07:09,840
我说这是第一次。
I said it was the first time.

2053
02:07:09,850 --> 02:07:12,140
曼尼昂夫人，
Now, Mrs. Manion...

2054
02:07:12,150 --> 02:07:14,750
我非常挂念那条失踪的内裤。
I'm quite concerned about the lost panties.

2055
02:07:14,760 --> 02:07:18,120
你能不能向法庭描述一下这件衣服呢？
Would you describe this article 
of clothing to the courtroom?

2056
02:07:19,360 --> 02:07:22,330
它是尼龙的，边上有花边；
They were nylon, and had lace up the sides.

2057
02:07:22,330 --> 02:07:24,900
裤子上有个标签，
上面印着我购买的地方――
There was a label in them 
of the place I got them--

2058
02:07:24,900 --> 02:07:28,530
- “亚利桑那凤凰城时髦商店”。
- 内裤的颜色是什么？
- The Smart Shop in Phoenix, Arizona.
- What was the color of the panties?

2059
02:07:28,540 --> 02:07:30,570
- 我相信是白色。
- 你相信？
- I believe, white.
- You believe?

2060
02:07:30,570 --> 02:07:32,970
我有白色的和粉色的，
也有可能是粉色的。
I have white and pink.
They may have been pink.

2061
02:07:32,970 --> 02:07:34,770
你不确定？你没检查一下你的内衣，
You're not sure?
Haven't you checked your lingerie...

2062
02:07:34,780 --> 02:07:36,840
看看到底缺了哪条内裤？
to see which pair of panties is missing?

2063
02:07:36,840 --> 02:07:38,740
- 没有。
- 你丈夫因为工作回家晚了，
- No.
- When your husband came home late...

2064
02:07:38,750 --> 02:07:43,080
然后你们发生了一点小的口角，
这时你已经穿好衣准备外出了吗？
from work, and you had this little spat, 
were you already dressed to go out?

2065
02:07:43,080 --> 02:07:45,080
- 没有。
- 那你什么时候穿的衣服？
- No.
- When did you dress?

2066
02:07:45,090 --> 02:07:46,910
晚饭后，他睡觉时。
After dinner, when he was asleep.

2067
02:07:46,920 --> 02:07:49,420
有证人说你在酒吧时
没有穿长袜，是这样的吗？
It's been stated here that you were 
bare legged in the bar. Is that true?

2068
02:07:49,430 --> 02:07:50,920
是的
Yes.

2069
02:07:50,930 --> 02:07:53,650
出于对你丈夫的怒气，
你匆匆忙忙地离开了车房，
In your anger at your husband and 
your haste to get out of the trailer...

2070
02:07:53,660 --> 02:07:55,560
也许当时你也没有穿任何内裤。
perhaps you didn't put on any panties either.

2071
02:07:55,560 --> 02:07:58,600
反对。证人已经作证说她当时穿了什么。
Objection. Witness has already testified 
of what she was wearing.

2072
02:07:58,600 --> 02:08:01,260
- 反对有效。
- 你总是穿内裤的吗，曼尼昂夫人？
- Sustained.
- Do you always wear panties?

2073
02:08:01,260 --> 02:08:04,260
法官大人，我反对这样的质询方式。
Your Honor, I object to this 
line of questioning.

2074
02:08:04,260 --> 02:08:06,970
曼尼昂夫人平时是怎么做的并不重要，
It's immaterial what Mrs. Manion 
does all the time.

2075
02:08:06,970 --> 02:08:09,410
在她受到侵害的那个晚上，她穿着内裤，
On the night she was attacked, 
she was wearing panties...

2076
02:08:09,410 --> 02:08:11,510
我们关心这个就足够了。
and that's all we're concerned with.

2077
02:08:11,510 --> 02:08:15,850
法官大人，曼尼昂夫人看起来有点
不确定她穿了一条什么样的内裤。
Mrs. Manion seems a little bit uncertain 
about the kind of panties she wore.

2078
02:08:15,850 --> 02:08:19,010
既然这条内裤还没被找到，
所以我提出有可能…
And since these panties have not been 
found, I submit that it's possible...

2079
02:08:19,020 --> 02:08:21,590
她没穿任何内裤，所以忘了。
she wasn't wearing any and has forgotten.

2080
02:08:21,590 --> 02:08:25,960
- 这就是我问话的目的。
- 你回答吧，曼尼昂夫人。
- That's all I'm trying to get at.
- You may answer, Mrs. Manion.

2081
02:08:25,960 --> 02:08:29,260
你总是穿内裤的吗？
You always wear panties?

2082
02:08:29,260 --> 02:08:31,060
不是。
No.

2083
02:08:31,170 --> 02:08:34,260
那么在什么情况下你不穿内裤？
当你一个人在夜里外出时？
On what occasions don't you wear them?
When you go out alone at night?

2084
02:08:34,270 --> 02:08:38,270
不，不，不！反对！他说他就问一件事情，
现在他又得寸进尺了。
No, no. Objection. He says he's going 
after one thing and goes after another.

2085
02:08:38,270 --> 02:08:40,300
我要说反对有效。
I'll sustain the objection.

2086
02:08:40,310 --> 02:08:44,000
删除最后两个问题和曼尼昂夫人的回答。
Strike out the last two questions 
in Mrs. Manion's answer.

2087
02:08:44,010 --> 02:08:48,550
丹瑟先生，立即抛开内裤，
你造成的损害够多了。
Now, Mr. Dancer, get off the panties.
You've done enough damage.

2088
02:08:48,550 --> 02:08:50,640
好的，法官大人。
Yes, Your Honor.

2089
02:08:50,650 --> 02:08:54,850
曼尼昂夫人，你丈夫是一个容易嫉妒的人吗？
Mrs. Manion, is your husband a jealous man?

2090
02:08:54,860 --> 02:08:58,260
- 他爱我。
- 当然，但是他是否极度地嫉妒？
- He loves me.
- I'm sure, but is he overly jealous?

2091
02:08:58,260 --> 02:09:01,090
法官大人，证人如何回答这样的问题？
Your Honor, how can the witness 
answer that question?

2092
02:09:01,100 --> 02:09:03,130
嫉妒的标准是什么？
What's the norm of jealousy?

2093
02:09:03,130 --> 02:09:06,260
你能不能换一个
不同一点的问题呢，丹瑟先生？
Can you put your question 
a little differently, Mr. Dancer?

2094
02:09:06,270 --> 02:09:09,260
- 你丈夫有没有因为嫉妒的爆发而打过你？
- 不，法官大人。
- Has your husband struck you in a rage?
- No, Your Honor.

2095
02:09:09,260 --> 02:09:12,530
我认为丹瑟先生这是在下套子。
这个问题究竟和本案有什么关系？
I think Mr. Dancer's fishing now.
What's the relevance of this question?

2096
02:09:12,540 --> 02:09:14,770
法官大人，比格勒先生
搬了石头砸了自己的脚。
Your Honor, the shoe is 
squeezing Mr. Biegler's foot.

2097
02:09:14,780 --> 02:09:16,780
用他自己话来说，这不是一场
高中生之间的辩论，
In his own words, this is 
not a high school debate.

2098
02:09:16,780 --> 02:09:19,040
这是对一起谋杀案进行的交叉质询。
This is a cross-examination in a murder trial.

2099
02:09:19,050 --> 02:09:21,350
继续，丹瑟先生。
Proceed, Mr. Dancer.

2100
02:09:22,050 --> 02:09:28,550
曼尼昂夫人，你参加过在雷鸣湾的社交活动吗？
Did you ever go out socially in Thunder Bay?

2101
02:09:28,760 --> 02:09:30,690
参加过几次吧。
Yes, a few times.

2102
02:09:30,690 --> 02:09:33,660
在你丈夫的部队开来雷鸣湾时，巴尼・奎尔…
When your husband's outfit moved 
to Thunder Bay, didn't Barney Quill...

2103
02:09:33,660 --> 02:09:36,660
是不是为军官和太太们搞过个鸡尾酒会？
throw a cocktail party 
for the officers and their wives?

2104
02:09:36,660 --> 02:09:37,260
是的。
Yes.

2105
02:09:37,260 --> 02:09:40,460
在这个晚会上，你丈夫是不是打过一个少尉？
Didn't your husband strike a young 
second lieutenant at this party?

2106
02:09:41,270 --> 02:09:44,530
有一点小的扭打，没什么。
There was a little scuffle. It wasn't much.

2107
02:09:44,540 --> 02:09:47,900
- 因为什么原因？
- 我想我不记得了。
- What was it about?
- I'm not sure I remember.

2108
02:09:47,910 --> 02:09:51,900
- 是因为当时喝得太多，记不起来了？
- 不，我没喝多。
- Were you too drunk to remember?
- No, I was not.

2109
02:09:52,950 --> 02:09:55,070
我想那是因为…
I think it was because...

2110
02:09:55,080 --> 02:09:59,180
当我和我丈夫跳舞时，
少尉老是想插进来。
the lieutenant was cutting in too much
when I was dancing with my husband.

2111
02:09:59,190 --> 02:10:02,450
紧接着在阳台上，
你丈夫有没有打你耳光，
Shortly after on the verandah, didn't
your husband slap you hard enough...

2112
02:10:02,460 --> 02:10:04,860
下手如此之重把你打得靠到了墙上？
so that you fell against the wall?

2113
02:10:07,260 --> 02:10:10,230
- 他喝了很多。
- 那是因为嫉妒的爆发吗？
- He was drinking.
- Wasn't this a jealous rage?

2114
02:10:10,230 --> 02:10:13,490
- 我不知道！
- 你记得为什么他会打你？
- I don't know!
- Do you remember why he struck you?

2115
02:10:13,500 --> 02:10:14,250
是的。
Yes.

2116
02:10:14,250 --> 02:10:18,100
不是出于他对你的愤怒吗，
因为他认为你在怂恿那位年轻人？
Wasn't he enraged at you because he 
thought you'd encouraged the young man?

2117
02:10:18,110 --> 02:10:21,510
- 他可能是这样想的。
- 曼尼昂夫人，有人看见了整个事件过程。
- He might have thought so.
- There are witnesses to this affair.

2118
02:10:21,510 --> 02:10:24,260
我想再问你一次，这是不是嫉妒的爆发？
I'll ask you again. Wasn't this a jealous rage?

2119
02:10:24,260 --> 02:10:26,910
我想你可以这样说。
I guess you could call it that.

2120
02:10:28,020 --> 02:10:30,940
现在我问你，
Now I'll ask you.

2121
02:10:31,650 --> 02:10:34,180
在枪击的那个晚上，
On the night of the shooting...

2122
02:10:34,190 --> 02:10:36,090
你穿了什么？
what did you swear?

2123
02:10:36,090 --> 02:10:38,690
以《玫瑰经》的名义，你起的什么誓？
What oath did you take on the rosary?

2124
02:10:39,530 --> 02:10:43,430
- 关于巴尼・奎尔强奸我的事。
- 为什么你要以《玫瑰经》的名义发誓说…
- It was about Barney Quill raping me.
- Why did you swear on the rosary...

2125
02:10:43,430 --> 02:10:45,760
他强奸了你？
that he raped you?

2126
02:10:45,770 --> 02:10:48,490
原因我丈夫已经说过――
因为我当时有点歇斯底里！
For the reason my husband said--
because I was hysterical!

2127
02:10:48,500 --> 02:10:51,260
那是他给出的他让你发誓的理由，
那么你为什么要发誓呢？
That was the reason he gave for asking 
you to swear. What was it for swearing?

2128
02:10:51,260 --> 02:10:53,260
- 好让他相信我。
- 为什么他会不相信你？
- So he'd believe me.
- Why shouldn't he?

2129
02:10:53,260 --> 02:10:56,540
反对！用《玫瑰经》的理由已经明确了，
Objection! The reason for the use 
of the rosary has been established.

2130
02:10:56,540 --> 02:10:58,260
这些问题都是非实质性的。
These questions are immaterial.

2131
02:10:58,260 --> 02:11:01,940
不，我想我愿意听听答案，比格勒先生。
No, I think I'll take the answer, Mr. Biegler.

2132
02:11:01,950 --> 02:11:05,910
我再问你一次，曼尼昂夫人，
为什么他不相信你？
I'll ask you again, Mrs. Manion.
Why shouldn't he believe you?

2133
02:11:07,420 --> 02:11:09,260
因为当时我说话语无伦次！
Because I wasn't making much sense!

2134
02:11:09,260 --> 02:11:11,550
他会认为你对这样的事情撒谎吗？
Did he think you'd lie about a thing like that?

2135
02:11:11,560 --> 02:11:15,260
反对，法官大人！曼尼昂中尉已经
作过证说他当时的想法！
Objection, Your Honor! Lt. Manion had 
already testified as to what he thought!

2136
02:11:15,260 --> 02:11:19,260
- 反对有效。
- 那天晚上你丈夫打你了吗？
- Sustained.
- Did your husband strike you that night?

2137
02:11:19,270 --> 02:11:21,600
他打你了吗那晚？
Did he hit you that night?

2138
02:11:23,400 --> 02:11:26,000
他…他…
Well, he--

2139
02:11:26,010 --> 02:11:29,470
他也许因为我的歇斯底里打了我一记耳光。
He may have slapped me because I was hysterical.

2140
02:11:29,480 --> 02:11:32,040
你是不是发了假誓好让他不再打你？
Didn't you swear to a lie to keep him 
from hitting you again?

2141
02:11:32,050 --> 02:11:34,040
不，我没有，我没有发假誓！
No, I didn't! I did not!

2142
02:11:34,050 --> 02:11:37,340
也有可能他在大门外面就已经把你打了个半死，
因为他正好逮住你和巴尼・奎尔从情人小径兜风回家？
Hadn't he already beaten you up when he 
caught you coming home with Quill?

2143
02:11:37,350 --> 02:11:41,680
反对！反对！证人已经作证说
她是被巴尼・奎尔殴打的！
Objection! The witness has already 
testified she was beaten by Quill!

2144
02:11:41,690 --> 02:11:43,920
安静，安静。
Quiet. Quiet.

2145
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:46,320
没有问题了。
No more questions.

2146
02:11:46,730 --> 02:11:49,390
我想这位证人已经受够了，法官大人。
I think the witness has had enough, Your Honor.

2147
02:11:49,400 --> 02:11:52,970
证人可以退下了。
下面是午餐休庭。
The witness may step down. 
We'll recess for lunch.

2148
02:11:54,670 --> 02:11:57,170
休庭到下午1点。
Recess until 1:00.

2149
02:11:59,810 --> 02:12:02,210
对不起，亲爱的，你表现得很好。
I'm sorry, baby. You were fine.

2150
02:12:35,010 --> 02:12:36,970
史密斯医生。
Dr. Smith.

2151
02:12:37,260 --> 02:12:39,740
我是来接你的。我叫……
I've come to meet you. My name is--

2152
02:12:39,950 --> 02:12:42,780
- 对不起，你认错人了。
- 也许我是你要找的人。
- I'm sorry. You've been mistaken.
- Maybe I'm the one you're looking for.

2153
02:12:42,780 --> 02:12:44,750
你是比格勒先生吗？
Are you Mr. Biegler?

2154
02:12:44,850 --> 02:12:47,320
不，我是他这个案子的同事。
No, I'm his associate in the case.

2155
02:12:47,420 --> 02:12:50,290
- 别跟我说你就是史密斯医生。
- 就是我。
- Don't tell me you're Dr. Smith.
- That's me.

2156
02:12:50,290 --> 02:12:52,590
军方的精神病医生？
The army psychiatrist?

2157
02:12:52,590 --> 02:12:54,960
也许你估计我会穿军服。
Maybe you expected me to be in uniform.

2158
02:12:54,960 --> 02:12:57,260
不，
No.

2159
02:12:57,260 --> 02:12:59,790
我没料到你那么年轻。
I didn't expect anybody so young.

2160
02:12:59,800 --> 02:13:01,700
我四十了。
I'm 40.

2161
02:13:01,800 --> 02:13:04,740
我估计你可能有…
I sort of hoped you'd...

2162
02:13:04,840 --> 02:13:07,340
一把胡子，戴一个单片眼镜。
have a beard and wear a monocle.

2163
02:13:07,340 --> 02:13:09,530
噢，是这样啊。
I see.

2164
02:13:09,540 --> 02:13:11,940
这样是不是好点？
Is that better?

2165
02:13:12,050 --> 02:13:14,810
你今天下午出庭。
You're on the stand this afternoon.

2166
02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:19,750
医生，你是否已经就弗雷德里克・曼尼昂…
Doctor, have you formed an opinion 
as to Frederick Manion's...

2167
02:13:19,750 --> 02:13:22,790
在他杀巴尼・奎尔那晚的
精神和情绪状态形成意见了呢？
mental and emotional state 
at the time he killed Barney Quill?

2168
02:13:22,790 --> 02:13:24,520
- 是的。
- 你的意见是什么？
- I have.
- And what is that opinion?

2169
02:13:24,530 --> 02:13:27,620
在他开枪的时候，
他患有“临时性精神错乱”症。
He was temporarily insane 
at the time of the shooting.

2170
02:13:27,630 --> 02:13:29,920
在他开枪的时候，你相信他有…
At the time of the shooting, 
do you believe he was able...

2171
02:13:29,930 --> 02:13:32,160
分辨是非的能力吗？
to distinguish right from wrong?

2172
02:13:32,170 --> 02:13:35,330
也许有，也许没有。
这没有太大的区别。
He may or may not have been.
It doesn't make too much difference.

2173
02:13:35,340 --> 02:13:38,500
好吧，医生，你能不能尽可能清楚地…
Now, Doctor, as clearly as you can...

2174
02:13:38,510 --> 02:13:42,170
解释一下弗雷德里克・曼尼昂的
“临时性精神错乱”？
will you explain 
Frederick Manion's temporary insanity?

2175
02:13:42,180 --> 02:13:45,300
这又被称为“习惯性分裂反应”，指的是…
It is known as dissociative reaction...

2176
02:13:45,310 --> 02:13:47,740
一种精神上的震撼，它会产生…
a psychic shock which creates...

2177
02:13:47,750 --> 02:13:50,150
一种几乎是无法抗拒的紧张，
an almost overwhelming tension...

2178
02:13:50,150 --> 02:13:53,150
处于震撼中的人必须释放掉这种紧张。
which the person in shock must alleviate.

2179
02:13:53,150 --> 02:13:55,780
在曼尼昂中尉的这个案例中，他是个战士，
In Lt. Manion's case, a soldier...

2180
02:13:55,790 --> 02:13:58,720
所以他自然会诉诸于行动。
it is only natural that he would turn to action.

2181
02:13:58,730 --> 02:14:01,390
只有对巴尼・奎尔采取…
Only direct, simple action...

2182
02:14:01,400 --> 02:14:04,950
直截了当的、简单的行动，
才能释放掉这种无法忍受的紧张。
against Barney Quill would relieve 
this unbearable tension.

2183
02:14:04,970 --> 02:14:08,690
这并不特别罕见。例如在战场上，
一些更加异乎寻常的壮举，
This is not too uncommon. For example, 
in combat, some of the more...

2184
02:14:08,700 --> 02:14:11,640
就是发生在这样一种精神状态下。
remarkable heroics take place 
in this state of mind.

2185
02:14:11,640 --> 02:14:15,870
有没有一个更加容易理解的名字
指的是“习惯性分裂反应”？
Is there another name for dissociative
reaction that we might recognize?

2186
02:14:15,880 --> 02:14:19,280
有，它又被称为“无法抑制的冲动”。
Yes, it has been known as irresistible impulse.

2187
02:14:19,280 --> 02:14:22,610
医生，一个人要是被这种
“无法抑制的冲动”所控制，
Now, Doctor, a man in the grip
of irresistible impulse...

2188
02:14:22,620 --> 02:14:25,080
那么他还可能会征询邻居的建议，
would he be likely to go 
to his neighbor for advice...

2189
02:14:25,090 --> 02:14:27,880
或者打电话给警察寻求帮助吗？
or call up the police to come to his aid?

2190
02:14:27,890 --> 02:14:30,820
- 完全不相容。
- 是的，可是我们的这个人…
- Completely incompatible.
- Yes, but our man...

2191
02:14:30,820 --> 02:14:33,550
在他动身去找奎尔之前，
was able to think of going and taking out a gun...

2192
02:14:33,560 --> 02:14:36,030
他能够想着去取出枪来上好子弹。
and loading it before setting out to find Quill.

2193
02:14:36,030 --> 02:14:40,530
那是他的心理意识在起作用，
即使他弄不到枪，他也无论如何要去的。
That's his conscious mind working, but 
he'd go even if a gun wasn't available.

2194
02:14:40,530 --> 02:14:44,260
一个被“习惯性分裂反应”控制的人，
他看上去是怎么样的？
How would a man look 
in the grip of dissociative reaction?

2195
02:14:44,270 --> 02:14:48,400
他可能显得死一般的平静，
极度的从容谨慎。
He might appear to be deadly calm, 
fiercely deliberate.

2196
02:14:48,410 --> 02:14:51,070
嗯哼，你会不会形容他的行为…
Mm-hmm. Would you describe his behavior...

2197
02:14:51,080 --> 02:14:54,010
就像是一个邮差，来送了一封信？
as being like a mailman delivering the mail?

2198
02:14:54,010 --> 02:14:58,250
这个比喻不赖，像个邮差，
他有件活儿要干，他就会去干。
That's not bad. Like a mailman, he would 
have a job to do, and he would do it.

2199
02:14:59,820 --> 02:15:02,390
- 你的证人。
- 医生，
- Your witness.
- Doctor...

2200
02:15:02,390 --> 02:15:04,920
你发现弗雷德里克・曼尼昂有精神病吗？
did you find any psychosis in Frederick Manion?

2201
02:15:04,930 --> 02:15:06,960
- 没有。
- 神经官能症呢？
- I did not.
- Any neuroses?

2202
02:15:06,960 --> 02:15:08,990
我没发现他有神经官能症的病史。
I found no history of neuroses.

2203
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:12,060
妄想症的病史呢？
Any history of delusion?

2204
02:15:12,070 --> 02:15:14,070
- 没有。
- 失去记忆？
- None.
- Loss of memory?

2205
02:15:14,070 --> 02:15:17,300
- 这起案子之前没有。
- 你有没有发现……
- Not before this instance.
- Did you find any history--

2206
02:15:17,300 --> 02:15:21,740
- 你们看见玛丽・皮兰特了吗？
- 她午饭后没有回来。
- Can you spot Mary Pilant?
- She didn't come back after lunch.

2207
02:15:21,740 --> 02:15:24,500
我想你得放弃那个证人了。
I think you'd better give up on that one.

2208
02:15:24,510 --> 02:15:27,410
医生，你说被告可能有、也可能没有…
Doctor, you stated that the defendant 
might or might not...

2209
02:15:27,410 --> 02:15:29,480
分辨是非的能力，
have been able to distinguish...

2210
02:15:29,480 --> 02:15:32,310
但是这并没有什么区别。
the difference between right and wrong,
but it wouldn't have made a difference.

2211
02:15:32,320 --> 02:15:34,550
- 你是那样说的，我说得没错吧？
- 大致可以这么说吧。
- Am I right? Is that what you said?
- Approximately, yes.

2212
02:15:34,550 --> 02:15:36,590
你的意思是在他开枪的时候，
Did you mean that at the time of the shooting...

2213
02:15:36,590 --> 02:15:38,560
他可能知道什么是对什么是错？
he could have known the difference 
between right and wrong?

2214
02:15:38,560 --> 02:15:40,560
可能吧，是的。
He might have, yes.

2215
02:15:40,560 --> 02:15:42,490
史密斯医生，
Dr. Smith...

2216
02:15:42,500 --> 02:15:45,530
如果被告能够知道他在做的事情，
if the defendant could have known 
what he was doing...

2217
02:15:45,530 --> 02:15:48,070
而且他能够意识到这事是错的，
那么你怎么可以跑到这儿来…
and could have known it was wrong,
how can you come here...

2218
02:15:48,070 --> 02:15:50,260
作证说他是正当的精神错乱？
and testify that he was legally insane?

2219
02:15:50,270 --> 02:15:52,840
我没说他是正当的精神错乱，
I'm not saying he was legally insane.

2220
02:15:52,840 --> 02:15:54,870
我说的是在他的精神状态下，
I'm saying that in his mental condition...

2221
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:57,500
知不知道对错没有任何实质的区别。
it would not have made any difference
whether he knew right from wrong.

2222
02:15:57,510 --> 02:16:00,300
他无论如何都会向奎尔开枪。
He would still have shot Quill.

2223
02:16:00,320 --> 02:16:06,260
史密斯医生，你的这个意见
是否就是你对本案最终的证词？
Are you willing to rest your testimony 
in this case on this opinion?

2224
02:16:06,260 --> 02:16:08,550
是的，我就是这个意见。
Yes, I am.

2225
02:16:09,560 --> 02:16:12,450
法官大人，我想请求短暂休庭。
Your Honor, I'd like to ask for a short recess.

2226
02:16:12,460 --> 02:16:16,280
公诉方律师想在法庭议事室
和比格勒先生面议。
The attorneys for the people would like 
to meet with Mr. Biegler in chambers.

2227
02:16:16,290 --> 02:16:17,200
比格勒先生？
Mr. Biegler?

2228
02:16:17,200 --> 02:16:20,360
- 悉听尊便，法官大人。
- 短暂休庭。
- Glad to oblige, Your Honor.
- Short recess.

2229
02:16:20,370 --> 02:16:22,740
陪审团请留在原位。
The jury will remain.

2230
02:16:33,510 --> 02:16:35,710
总有一天，我会惊世骇俗，
Someday, I'm going to horrify tradition...

2231
02:16:35,720 --> 02:16:38,310
在那个神圣的法庭内，放出一团…
and lay a dense, blue cloud...

2232
02:16:38,320 --> 02:16:41,510
由燃烧的烟草产生的浓厚的蓝色烟云。
of tobacco smoke in that hallowed courtroom.

2233
02:16:41,520 --> 02:16:43,890
你心里想什么呢，丹瑟先生？
What's on your mind, Mr. Dancer?

2234
02:16:43,890 --> 02:16:46,320
法官大人，鉴于史密斯医生的证词，
我想也许辩方…
Your Honor, in view of Dr. Smith's 
testimony, I thought perhaps...

2235
02:16:46,330 --> 02:16:48,390
可能希望改变他们的辩护请求。
the defense might like to change their plea.

2236
02:16:48,400 --> 02:16:51,290
- 改成什么？
- 当然是服罪。
- Change it to what?
- Guilty, of course.

2237
02:16:51,300 --> 02:16:53,330
不，我们仍想拼尽全力。
No, we'll still go for broke.

2238
02:16:53,330 --> 02:16:55,990
见鬼，保利，你知道在密歇根，
一个家伙除非他不能明辨是非，
Hell, Paulie, you know a guy's 
not considered legally nuts...

2239
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,130
否则的话他不会被认作是正当的疯子。
in Michigan unless 
he didn't know right from wrong.

2240
02:16:58,140 --> 02:17:02,700
- 为什么你不就此了结了呢？
- 法官大人，您可以翻到486页吗？
- Why don't you get this over with?
- Your Honor, will you turn to page 486?

2241
02:17:02,710 --> 02:17:07,270
- 那是什么？
- 看起来像是一本法律书，罗德威克先生。
- What's that?
- Appears to be a law book, Mr. Lodwick.

2242
02:17:08,750 --> 02:17:10,870
噢，对不起，法官大人。
Oh, I'm sorry, Your Honor.

2243
02:17:10,880 --> 02:17:13,510
有时我制作这些玩意儿来帮助我思考。
I make those things to help me think sometimes.

2244
02:17:13,520 --> 02:17:15,990
- 钓鲈鱼用的？
- 不，钓青蛙用的。
- For perch?
- No, it was for frog.

2245
02:17:15,990 --> 02:17:18,020
他引证了哪个案例，法官？
What case is he citing?

2246
02:17:18,020 --> 02:17:20,320
在我们那地方，我们用叉子叉青蛙。
We gig frogs in my part of the country.

2247
02:17:20,330 --> 02:17:23,120
这里也一样。我自己喜欢钓鳟鱼，
It's the same up here.
I'm a trout man, myself...

2248
02:17:23,130 --> 02:17:25,260
但是这是个新的窍门我想试一下。
but this is a new wrinkle I'm gonna try.

2249
02:17:25,260 --> 02:17:29,260
在南面的拜尤，他们就用这个。
其方法是，准备一根很长的杆子，
They do it in the Bayou, down South.
The idea, they get a big, long pole...

2250
02:17:29,260 --> 02:17:31,630
和一根十磅的线，然后就…
and about a ten-pound line, just sort of...

2251
02:17:31,640 --> 02:17:33,800
在船上沿着河岸漂流，
drift along a high bank in a boat.

2252
02:17:33,810 --> 02:17:37,810
当你看见石头缝里有只大个的老牛蛙，
Then you see that big, old bullfrog in the crevice...

2253
02:17:37,810 --> 02:17:40,000
你就把这玩意飘到它的前方。
and sort of float this along in front of him.

2254
02:17:40,010 --> 02:17:42,840
啪！它的老舌头一吐出来，
Pop! That old tongue of his snaps out, and--

2255
02:17:42,850 --> 02:17:44,920
那么蛙腿就到你晚餐桌上了。
You've got frog legs for supper.

2256
02:17:44,920 --> 02:17:47,010
- 噢，老天哪！
- 您留着吧。
- I'll be darned.
- Why don't you keep it?

2257
02:17:47,020 --> 02:17:49,950
- 有时间玩玩。
- 谢谢，我会的。
- Try it sometime.
- Thanks. I will.

2258
02:17:49,960 --> 02:17:52,290
四百八十六页。
Four eighty-six.

2259
02:17:53,130 --> 02:17:57,560
- 那是什么，法官大人？
- 对德费的公诉案，1886年。
- What is it, Your Honor?
- People v, Durfee, 1886.

2260
02:17:57,560 --> 02:18:00,290
看起来像是一个先例。
Looks like a precedent.

2261
02:18:00,300 --> 02:18:02,390
你愿意读一下吗，丹瑟先生？
Would you like to read it?

2262
02:18:03,400 --> 02:18:07,400
不，谢谢，法官大人。
我想我记起这个案子了。
No, thank you, Your Honor.
I think I recall the case.

2263
02:18:08,110 --> 02:18:11,040
我们咬钩了…
We're hooked...

2264
02:18:11,040 --> 02:18:13,340
像那只青蛙。
like the frog.

2265
02:18:15,450 --> 02:18:18,680
哈考特医生，你在哪儿受的大学教育？
Dr. Harcourt, where did you receive 
your university training?

2266
02:18:18,750 --> 02:18:20,790
马里兰州巴尔的摩市的约翰霍普金斯大学。
Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, Maryland.

2267
02:18:20,790 --> 02:18:22,950
你现在在哪儿从业？
And where do you practice now?

2268
02:18:22,960 --> 02:18:26,650
我是“邦德州立精神病院”的医务监督。
I'm the medical superintendent of the 
Bonder State Hospital for the Insane.

2269
02:18:26,660 --> 02:18:28,960
在这里有人指出，
It's been stated here that...

2270
02:18:28,960 --> 02:18:31,960
“习惯性分裂反应”或“无法抑制的冲动”
dissociative reaction, or irresistible impulse...

2271
02:18:31,970 --> 02:18:34,900
在参加过战斗的士兵当中并不罕见。
is not uncommon among soldiers in combat.

2272
02:18:34,900 --> 02:18:37,730
- 你同意这种说法吗？
- 同意，
- Do you agree with that statement?
- I do...

2273
02:18:37,740 --> 02:18:39,830
但不是像史密斯医生所说的那样。
but not as it was put by Dr. Smith.

2274
02:18:39,840 --> 02:18:43,710
- 你和史密斯医生的分歧在哪里？
- “习惯性分裂反应”…
- Where would you depart from Dr. Smith?
- Dissociative reaction...

2275
02:18:43,710 --> 02:18:47,540
不会无缘无故突然出现，之后又倏地离去。
is not something that comes out of 
the blue and disappears as quickly.

2276
02:18:47,550 --> 02:18:51,880
即使在参加过战斗的士兵当中，
它也只可能发生在那些…
It can only occur, 
even among soldiers in combat...

2277
02:18:51,890 --> 02:18:55,920
长期处于精神神经症状态的个体身上。
if the individual has a psychoneurotic 
condition of long standing.

2278
02:18:55,920 --> 02:18:59,690
前面有证词说，对被告的精神病检查，
It's been testified here that 
a psychiatric exam of the defendant...

2279
02:18:59,690 --> 02:19:02,450
没有证据表明他患有神经官能症，
showed no evidence of neuroses...

2280
02:19:02,460 --> 02:19:04,790
也没有“习惯性分裂反应”的病史。
and no history of dissociative reaction.

2281
02:19:04,800 --> 02:19:06,860
你还听证人说过，
You've further heard it testified...

2282
02:19:06,870 --> 02:19:08,960
在枪击的那个晚上，被告的行为…
that the defendant's behavior 
on the night of the shooting...

2283
02:19:08,970 --> 02:19:11,630
冷静而直接。
was cool and direct.

2284
02:19:11,640 --> 02:19:14,400
作为一名观察员，你记得这些证词吧？
As an observer, do you remember this testimony?

2285
02:19:14,400 --> 02:19:15,310
记得。
Yes.

2286
02:19:15,310 --> 02:19:18,640
由此，你是否形成了有关被告
在发生枪击那晚的…
From this, have you formed an opinion
about the defendant's sanity...

2287
02:19:18,650 --> 02:19:20,680
精神状况的意见了呢？
on the night of the shooting?

2288
02:19:20,680 --> 02:19:24,720
是的，我的意见是他完全处于清醒状态，
I'm of the opinion that he was in 
possession of his faculties...

2289
02:19:24,720 --> 02:19:27,480
因此他并没有受到自己的
无意识情绪的控制。
so that he was not dominated 
by his unconscious mind.

2290
02:19:27,490 --> 02:19:31,420
换句话说，他也没有受到
“无法抑制的冲动”的控制？
In other words, he was not 
in the grip of irresistible impulse.

2291
02:19:31,420 --> 02:19:33,750
- 在我看来，他没有。
- 谢谢你，医生。你的证人，比格勒先生。
- In my opinion, he was not.
- Thank you. Your witness.

2292
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:37,850
哈考特医生，精神病学试图探究的是人类…
Dr. Harcourt, psychiatry is an effort 
to probe into the dark...

2293
02:19:37,860 --> 02:19:39,930
隐秘的、未知的精神世界。
undiscovered world of the mind.

2294
02:19:39,930 --> 02:19:43,300
在那里，世界可以是圆的，也可以是方的。
And in there, the world 
might be round, it could be square.

2295
02:19:43,300 --> 02:19:47,100
你的意见有可能是错的，而史密斯医生的意见
有可能是对的。是这样的吗？
Your opinion could be wrong, Dr. Smith's 
could be right. Is that true?

2296
02:19:47,110 --> 02:19:49,870
要是我不同意的话，会显得我很不专业。
I'd be a poor doctor 
if I didn't agree with that.

2297
02:19:49,880 --> 02:19:53,380
但是，我相信我的意见是对的。
But I believe my opinion to be right.

2298
02:19:53,380 --> 02:19:55,880
你认为你有可能改变看法吗，
Do you think you might've changed your opinion...

2299
02:19:55,880 --> 02:19:58,910
要是你也像史密斯医生那样为被告做过检查？
if you'd examined the defendant as Dr. Smith did?

2300
02:19:59,390 --> 02:20:02,120
- 我相信不会吧。
- 但是史密斯医生的意见…
- I don't believe so.
- But Dr. Smith's opinion...

2301
02:20:02,220 --> 02:20:04,310
是在更可靠的情况下形成的，不是吗？
was made under better circumstances, wasn't it?

2302
02:20:04,420 --> 02:20:07,260
如果你的意思是指他可以检查这个人，是的。
If you mean that he was able to 
examine the man, yes.

2303
02:20:07,260 --> 02:20:10,660
- 是这个意思。谢谢，医生。
- 好了，哈考特医生。
- Yeah. Thank you, Doctor.
- That's all, Dr. Harcourt.

2304
02:20:10,660 --> 02:20:14,630
- 还有什么辩驳的吗？
- 我们的处境不妙，米奇。
- Is there more rebuttal?
- We're over a barrel, Mitch.

2305
02:20:14,630 --> 02:20:17,330
我们必须用他。
We have to use him.

2306
02:20:17,340 --> 02:20:20,070
我们传杜温・米勒出庭。
We call Duane Miller to the stand.

2307
02:20:20,070 --> 02:20:22,500
请庭警带证人进来好吗？
Will the sheriff please bring in the witness?

2308
02:20:28,720 --> 02:20:31,260
他会说什么？
What can he tell?

2309
02:20:31,260 --> 02:20:33,840
什么都没有。
Nothing.

2310
02:20:33,850 --> 02:20:36,150
他没什么可以说的。
He can't tell anything.

2311
02:20:46,600 --> 02:20:50,070
举起你的右手。
你能不能在上帝面前庄严宣誓，
Raise your right hand. Do you swear 
the testimony you give in this cause...

2312
02:20:50,070 --> 02:20:53,140
你即将为本庭所作的证词将是事实，
完全是事实，除了事实没有别的？
shall be the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?

2313
02:20:53,140 --> 02:20:54,740
我宣誓。
I do.

2314
02:20:57,010 --> 02:21:01,410
- 请报上你的姓名。
- 杜温・米勒，大伙儿都叫我杜克。
- State your name, please.
- Duane Miller. Most folks call me Duke.

2315
02:21:01,410 --> 02:21:03,410
目前你住在那里，米勒先生？
Where do you presently reside?

2316
02:21:03,420 --> 02:21:05,580
就在街对面的监狱里。
Across the alley in the jail.

2317
02:21:05,590 --> 02:21:07,880
你认识被告弗雷德里克・曼尼昂吗？
You know the defendant, Frederick Manion?

2318
02:21:07,890 --> 02:21:10,820
是的，在过去几个星期里我认识他的，
他的牢房就在我旁边。
Yeah, I got to know him in the past 
few weeks. His cell's next to mine.

2319
02:21:10,820 --> 02:21:13,390
你和中尉最后一次谈话都谈了些什么？
What was the last conversation 
you had with the lieutenant?

2320
02:21:13,390 --> 02:21:17,090
除了今天早晨的打招呼，
最后一次是在昨天晚上。
Except for "hello" this morning, 
the last time was last night.

2321
02:21:17,100 --> 02:21:20,860
- 昨天晚上你们谈到他的审判啦？
- 是的，有一些。
- Did you discuss his trial last night?
- Yeah, some.

2322
02:21:20,870 --> 02:21:24,030
你能不能告诉法庭，曼尼昂中尉
对于他的审判都说了些什么？
Would you tell the court what Lt. Manion 
had to say about the trial?

2323
02:21:24,040 --> 02:21:27,630
嗯，我说：“你的事情怎么样啦，中尉？”
Well, I said, "Are things looking up, Lieutenant?"

2324
02:21:27,640 --> 02:21:30,740
他说：“我搞掂啦，伙计。”
And he said, "I got it made, buster."

2325
02:21:30,740 --> 02:21:33,410
他说：“我骗过了我的律师，
He said, "I fooled my lawyer...

2326
02:21:33,410 --> 02:21:35,140
我骗过了那个查脑瓜子的，
I fooled that head-shrinker...

2327
02:21:35,150 --> 02:21:37,810
我也会骗过陪审团的那帮玉米棒子【傻冒】。”
and I'm gonna fool 
that bunch of corn cobs on the jury."

2328
02:21:37,820 --> 02:21:41,880
撒谎！你个下流的、卑劣的骗子！
Liar! You're a lousy, stinkin' liar!

2329
02:21:42,820 --> 02:21:45,320
镇静，沉住气。
Take it easy, now.

2330
02:21:45,430 --> 02:21:48,390
我为我的委托人道歉，法官大人。
I apologize for my client, Your Honor.

2331
02:21:48,400 --> 02:21:52,260
但是他的爆发应该情有可原，因为控方居然…
Yet his outburst is almost excusable, 
since the prosecution has seen fit...

2332
02:21:52,260 --> 02:21:55,890
让一名罪犯出席作证，以控告一名美军军官。
to put a felon on the stand to testify
against an officer in the U.S. Army.

2333
02:21:55,900 --> 02:22:00,370
法官大人，我不知道谁是更加恶劣的违法者，
曼尼昂还是他的律师。
Your Honor, I don't know who's the 
worse offender, Manion or his lawyer.

2334
02:22:00,370 --> 02:22:02,840
我们快接近尾声了。
We're close to the end.

2335
02:22:02,840 --> 02:22:05,430
看在老天的份上，在这最后的几小时里，
In the name of heaven, let's have peace...

2336
02:22:05,450 --> 02:22:08,480
让我们心平气和、谦恭礼貌点。
and courtesy for these last few hours.

2337
02:22:08,480 --> 02:22:13,260
丹瑟先生，你继续你的质询
但不要发表评论。
Mr. Dancer, you will continue 
your interrogation without comment.

2338
02:22:13,260 --> 02:22:16,650
比格勒先生，你不要一有机会就放炮。
Mr. Biegler, you will not sound off 
at every opportunity.

2339
02:22:16,660 --> 02:22:20,050
被告在座位上坐好，把嘴巴闭上。
And the defendant will remain seated 
in his chair and keep his mouth shut.

2340
02:22:20,060 --> 02:22:22,450
- 现在继续吧。
- 米勒先生，
- Now go ahead.
- Mr. Miller...

2341
02:22:22,460 --> 02:22:25,260
你肯定曼尼昂中尉说的是：
are you certain that Lt. Manion said...

2342
02:22:25,270 --> 02:22:27,560
“我搞掂啦，伙计”？
"I've got it made, buster"?

2343
02:22:27,570 --> 02:22:30,430
- 他就是这么说的。
- 米勒先生，曼尼昂中尉还说了其它什么吗？
- That's what he said.
- Did Lt. Manion say anything else?

2344
02:22:30,440 --> 02:22:33,010
是的，先生。他说他出去后，
Yes, sir. He said when he got out...

2345
02:22:33,010 --> 02:22:35,540
要做的第一件事就是
一脚把那个婊子…
the first thing he was gonna do 
was kick that bitch...

2346
02:22:35,540 --> 02:22:38,440
从这儿踢到天国去。
from here to kingdom come.

2347
02:22:38,450 --> 02:22:41,840
- 他指的是谁？
- 他妻子。
- To whom was he referring?
- To his wife.

2348
02:22:42,350 --> 02:22:44,240
你的证人，比格勒先生。
Your witness.

2349
02:22:44,850 --> 02:22:47,650
- 你为什么入狱，米勒先生？
- 纵火。
- What are you in jail for, Mr. Miller?
- Arson.

2350
02:22:47,750 --> 02:22:49,740
我认罪了，正等候判决。
I copped out, and I'm waiting for a sentence.

2351
02:22:49,860 --> 02:22:51,850
你还犯有多少其它的罪？
How many other offenses have you committed?

2352
02:22:51,960 --> 02:22:55,260
小时候进过教养院，就这些了。
I was in reform school as a kid, but that's all.

2353
02:22:55,360 --> 02:22:58,300
法官大人，我想看一下这个人的犯罪记录。
Your Honor, I'd like to see 
this man's criminal record.

2354
02:22:58,400 --> 02:23:00,260
你有他的记录吗，罗德威克先生？
Do you have his record, Mr. Lodwick?

2355
02:23:00,260 --> 02:23:02,370
有，大人。
Yes, sir.

2356
02:23:02,770 --> 02:23:04,330
给你。
Here it is.

2357
02:23:07,140 --> 02:23:09,970
你的记录显示你曾六次入狱，
Your record shows you've been 
in prison six times...

2358
02:23:09,980 --> 02:23:12,600
在三个不同的州――
in three different states--

2359
02:23:12,610 --> 02:23:16,260
三项纵火罪，两项致命武器袭击罪，
three times for arson, twice for assault 
with a deadly weapon...

2360
02:23:16,260 --> 02:23:18,260
一项盗窃罪。
once for larceny.

2361
02:23:20,190 --> 02:23:23,260
记录还显示了你在四座城市监狱服过短刑，
Also shows you've done short stretches 
in four city jails...

2362
02:23:23,260 --> 02:23:25,920
受到的指控是有伤风化的暴露，
on charges of indecent exposure...

2363
02:23:25,930 --> 02:23:28,150
窗口偷窥，作伪证，
window-peeping, perjury...

2364
02:23:28,160 --> 02:23:31,260
和扰乱治安。
and disorderly conduct.

2365
02:23:31,260 --> 02:23:34,060
这是你的真实记录吗？
Is this your true record?

2366
02:23:34,070 --> 02:23:35,930
那些玩意儿从没对过。
Them things are never right.

2367
02:23:35,940 --> 02:23:38,330
你是怎么透信息给控方的，
How did you get the ear of the prosecution...

2368
02:23:38,340 --> 02:23:41,740
说想告诉他们你和曼尼昂中尉的谈话？
in order to tell them about the 
conversation you had with Lt. Manion?

2369
02:23:41,740 --> 02:23:44,830
- 地方检察官把我们带到他办公室。
- 带谁到他办公室？
- The D.A. was taking us into his office.
- Taking who into his office?

2370
02:23:44,840 --> 02:23:48,260
- 我们监狱里的犯人。
- 一下子都去，还是一次一个？
- Us prisoners in the jail.
- All at once, or one at a time?

2371
02:23:48,260 --> 02:23:51,260
一次一个。他和那个律师…
One at a time. Him and that other lawyer...

2372
02:23:51,260 --> 02:23:55,280
把我们带到他办公室，
问我们有关曼尼昂中尉的问题。
took us to his office and asked us 
questions about Lt. Manion.

2373
02:23:55,290 --> 02:23:58,650
有没有人允诺你，如果你出庭作证，
将对你从轻发落？
Were you promised a lighter sentence
if you went on the witness stand?

2374
02:23:58,660 --> 02:24:01,850
- 法官大人，公诉方反对……
- 反对无效。回答问题。
- Your Honor, the people object to--
- Overruled. Answer the question.

2375
02:24:01,860 --> 02:24:05,450
- 没人允诺我任何事情。
- 你以为那会对你自己的麻烦有帮助，
- I wasn't promised anything.
- You thought it'd help your troubles...

2376
02:24:05,470 --> 02:24:07,900
要是捏造一个这样的故事
来取悦地方检察官。
if you dreamed up this story 
to please the D.A.

2377
02:24:07,900 --> 02:24:10,870
- 我没捏造什么。
- 你肯定那都是曼尼昂中尉说的？
- I didn't dream up nothin'.
- You're sure that's what Manion said?

2378
02:24:10,870 --> 02:24:14,060
- 是的，我肯定。
- 就像你对你的犯罪记录一样肯定？
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- As sure as you were about your record?

2379
02:24:14,070 --> 02:24:18,030
呃，那个我想我可能是有点搞错了。
Well, I guess I kind of goofed on that one.

2380
02:24:19,150 --> 02:24:21,740
法官大人，我不想再问这人什么问题了，
Your Honor, I don't feel I can dignify...

2381
02:24:21,750 --> 02:24:24,410
这让我感到丢脸。
this creature with any more questions.

2382
02:24:24,420 --> 02:24:26,950
把证人带走。
Take the witness away.

2383
02:24:26,990 --> 02:24:29,150
比格勒先生，你想和你的委托人商议一下吗？
Would you like a conference with your client?

2384
02:24:29,160 --> 02:24:32,380
我可以看出来上一个证人
完全出乎你们的意料。
I can see how the last witness 
was quite a surprise.

2385
02:24:32,390 --> 02:24:34,760
不用了，法官大人，我们不需要商议。
No, Your Honor. We don't need a conference.

2386
02:24:34,760 --> 02:24:37,720
我想现在再传曼尼昂中尉上证人席。
I'll recall Lt. Manion to the stand right now.

2387
02:24:45,570 --> 02:24:49,100
你听了这个米勒的证词。
Now, you've heard the testimony of this Miller.

2388
02:24:49,940 --> 02:24:52,810
- 有哪部分是事实吗？
- 没有。
- Is any part of it true?
- None.

2389
02:24:53,680 --> 02:24:58,010
中尉，你知道为什么他会跑到这儿来
编出个这样的故事吗？
Lieutenant, do you have any idea why he 
might come here with a tale like that?

2390
02:24:58,020 --> 02:25:00,320
不知道，先生。
No, sir.

2391
02:25:01,450 --> 02:25:03,960
你和这个人谈过话吗？
Have you ever talked with this man?

2392
02:25:03,960 --> 02:25:05,620
是的。
Yes.

2393
02:25:05,630 --> 02:25:07,820
你们谈了什么？
What did you talk about?

2394
02:25:09,500 --> 02:25:11,760
没什么要紧的事。
Nothing important.

2395
02:25:11,760 --> 02:25:15,430
肯定没有谈过我个人的生活或我的感觉。
Certainly, nothing about 
my personal life or my feelings.

2396
02:25:15,440 --> 02:25:17,590
我想知道的就这些。
That's all I wanted to know.

2397
02:25:17,600 --> 02:25:20,330
曼尼昂中尉，
Lt. Manion...

2398
02:25:20,340 --> 02:25:23,470
你和米勒之间有没有过…
have you ever had any sort of...

2399
02:25:23,480 --> 02:25:26,240
什么过节？
trouble with Miller?

2400
02:25:26,850 --> 02:25:29,680
我不知道。你什么意思？
有没有争吵之类的事情？
I don't know. What do you mean?
An argument? Something like that?

2401
02:25:29,680 --> 02:25:33,880
你有没有攻击――肢体上攻击过他？
Did you ever attack-- physically attack him?

2402
02:25:34,820 --> 02:25:37,390
你的律师不可能替你回答这个问题，中尉。
Your lawyer can't answer 
the question for you, Lieutenant.

2403
02:25:37,390 --> 02:25:42,120
- 你有没有肢体上攻击过米勒？
- 严格地说，那称不上是攻击。
- Did you ever physically attack Miller?
- I wouldn't call it an attack, exactly.

2404
02:25:42,130 --> 02:25:44,260
有一天我把他的头按到栏杆上过。
I pushed his head against the bars one day.

2405
02:25:44,260 --> 02:25:47,460
- 为什么？
- 因为他说了我妻子的坏话。
- Why?
- He said something ugly about my wife.

2406
02:25:47,470 --> 02:25:51,260
你还记得你按着他的头往栏杆上撞吗？
Do you remember pushing or bumping 
his head against the bars?

2407
02:25:51,260 --> 02:25:53,400
当然，我刚告诉过你。
Sure. I just told you.

2408
02:25:53,410 --> 02:25:55,940
那么这不算是“习惯性分裂反应”，嗯？
Then this was not dissociative reaction.

2409
02:25:55,940 --> 02:25:57,970
被告没有资格回答这个问题。
The defendant isn't qualified to answer that.

2410
02:25:57,980 --> 02:26:00,810
- 反对有效。
- 曼尼昂中尉，
- Sustained.
- Lt. Manion...

2411
02:26:00,810 --> 02:26:03,260
你对巴尼・奎尔所做的反应，
wasn't your action against Barney Quill 
much the same...

2412
02:26:03,260 --> 02:26:05,940
是不是和你对米勒，
和对那个你在鸡尾酒会上…
as your action against Miller 
and against the lieutenant...

2413
02:26:05,950 --> 02:26:08,280
打了的少尉，所做的反应相同呢？
that you struck at the cocktail party?

2414
02:26:08,290 --> 02:26:12,920
都是在盛怒之下产生了有意识的、
蓄意的伤害或杀戮的欲望。
All in the heat of anger with a willful, 
conscious desire to hurt or kill?

2415
02:26:12,930 --> 02:26:15,560
我不记得我对奎尔所做的反应了。
I don't remember my action against Quill.

2416
02:26:16,400 --> 02:26:20,230
你知道你妻子和巴尼・奎尔是相好
有多长时间了？
How long had you known that your wife 
was running around with Barney Quill?

2417
02:26:21,270 --> 02:26:24,260
我从不知道有这样的事情。
I never knew anything like that.

2418
02:26:24,260 --> 02:26:26,230
我信任我妻子。
I trust my wife.

2419
02:26:27,110 --> 02:26:29,830
我想你时不时地打她
那只是为了找点乐子。
I suppose you just beat her up 
occasionally for the fun of it.

2420
02:26:29,840 --> 02:26:33,260
没有道理允许问这样的问题。
Nothing has been established
to permit a question like that.

2421
02:26:33,260 --> 02:26:35,440
他总是在暗指什么却不明确观点。
He keeps implying things 
without getting to the point.

2422
02:26:35,450 --> 02:26:38,880
就让他直接问中尉，
他有没有殴打过他妻子？
Let him ask the lieutenant, 
did he ever beat his wife?

2423
02:26:38,890 --> 02:26:40,850
我要说反对有效。
I'll sustain the objection.

2424
02:26:40,850 --> 02:26:43,780
你能重新表述一下你的问题吗，丹瑟先生？
Would you like to rephrase 
your question, Mr. Dancer?

2425
02:26:45,090 --> 02:26:47,320
不用了。谢谢，法官大人。
No thank you, Your Honor.

2426
02:26:47,330 --> 02:26:49,330
我问完了。
I've finished.

2427
02:26:49,330 --> 02:26:52,690
那我来问好了。曼尼昂中尉，你有没有…
Then I'll ask him. Did you, Lt. Manion...

2428
02:26:52,700 --> 02:26:55,930
在发生枪击的那个晚上，或任何其它时候
殴打过你的妻子？
ever beat your wife on the night
of the shooting or any other time?

2429
02:26:55,940 --> 02:26:57,970
- 没有，先生。
- 在你心里有没有一丝的疑问，
- No, sir.
- Is there any doubt in your mind...

2430
02:26:57,970 --> 02:27:00,470
怀疑巴尼・奎尔强奸了你的妻子？
that Barney Quill raped Mrs. Manion?

2431
02:27:00,470 --> 02:27:02,470
- 没有，先生。
- 就这些。
- No, sir.
- That's all.

2432
02:27:02,480 --> 02:27:04,280
请退席，中尉。
Step down, Lieutenant.

2433
02:27:09,980 --> 02:27:12,940
- 大事不妙？
- 相当糟糕。
- We hurt?
- We're hurt bad.

2434
02:27:18,490 --> 02:27:22,360
法官大人，我知道时间已经很紧，
所以我不想请求休庭。
Your Honor, I know time is pressing.
I don't want to ask for a recess.

2435
02:27:22,360 --> 02:27:24,400
但是我想离开法庭一下，就一会儿。
I would like to leave the courtroom for a moment.

2436
02:27:24,400 --> 02:27:27,060
如果那很重要的话，我们可以给你一分钟。
If it's important, we can be at ease for a minute.

2437
02:27:27,070 --> 02:27:29,260
谢谢您，大人。
Thank you, sir.

2438
02:27:29,500 --> 02:27:32,070
这太不合规矩了，法官大人。
This is highly irregular, Your Honor.

2439
02:27:32,070 --> 02:27:35,770
没有理由据此整出个联邦大案来【小题大做】。
There's no reason to make a federal case out of it.

2440
02:27:46,490 --> 02:27:50,020
非常感谢，法官大人。
我们现在有了另一位反驳证人。
Thank you very much, Your Honor.
We now have another rebuttal witness.

2441
02:27:50,020 --> 02:27:52,420
辩方传玛丽・皮兰特出庭。
The defense calls Mary Pilant to the stand.

2442
02:27:52,430 --> 02:27:54,620
法官大人，我们必须抗议这整个安排。
We must protest this whole affair.

2443
02:27:54,630 --> 02:27:57,560
尊贵的辩方律师冲出去进行了秘密商议，
The noble defense attorney rushes out 
to a secret conference...

2444
02:27:57,560 --> 02:28:00,630
而现在却在最后一刻
戏剧性地把证人带下了过道。
and now the last-minute witness is being
brought dramatically down the aisle.

2445
02:28:00,630 --> 02:28:03,760
这整个事情很显然受到了操控，
目的是不正当地激起陪审团的兴趣。
The whole thing has obviously been
rigged to unduly excite the jury.

2446
02:28:03,770 --> 02:28:06,340
这是比格勒先生的又一个陈腐鄙俗的诡计。
It's another cornball trick.

2447
02:28:06,340 --> 02:28:09,700
法官大人，我不会怪丹瑟先生
有被占了便宜的感觉。
Your Honor, I don't blame Mr. Dancer 
for feeling put-upon.

2448
02:28:09,710 --> 02:28:12,780
我只是个卑微的地方律师，
想做的只是尽我所能，
I'm just a humble country lawyer 
trying to do the best I can...

2449
02:28:12,780 --> 02:28:16,280
全力对抗这位从大都市兰辛来的
才华横溢的检察官。
against this brilliant prosecutor 
from the big city of Lansing.

2450
02:28:16,280 --> 02:28:18,750
让证人宣誓。
Swear the witness.

2451
02:28:18,750 --> 02:28:22,650
请举起你的右手。你能不能
在上帝面前庄严宣誓，
Raise your right hand. Do you swear
the testimony you shall give...

2452
02:28:22,660 --> 02:28:26,560
你即将为本庭所作的证词将是事实，
完全是事实，除了事实没有别的？
shall be the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?

2453
02:28:26,560 --> 02:28:28,860
- 我宣誓。
- 请坐下。
- I do.
- Sit down, please.

2454
02:28:31,630 --> 02:28:34,720
- 你住在哪儿，皮兰特小姐？
- 雷鸣湾的“雷鸣湾旅店”。
- Where do you live, Miss Pilant?
- At Thunder Bay Inn in Thunder Bay.

2455
02:28:34,730 --> 02:28:38,100
- 你在那儿住了多长时间了？
- 两年了。
- And how long have you lived there?
- For two years.

2456
02:28:38,100 --> 02:28:41,170
- 你的职业是什么？
- 我管理这家旅店。
- And what's your profession?
- I manage the inn.

2457
02:28:41,170 --> 02:28:45,900
皮兰特小姐，“雷鸣湾旅店”的洗衣房是怎样运作的？
Now, Miss Pilant, how is the laundry 
handled at Thunder Bay Inn?

2458
02:28:45,910 --> 02:28:47,940
有个斜道将衣服滑入洗衣间。
It's chuted down to the laundry room.

2459
02:28:47,950 --> 02:28:50,740
二楼的滑道在什么位置？
Where is the location of that chute 
on the second floor?

2460
02:28:50,750 --> 02:28:54,380
- 在42号和43号房之间。
- 谁住在那两个房间？
- Between room 42 and 43.
- Who lives in those rooms?

2461
02:28:54,390 --> 02:28:58,150
我住42号，奎尔先生住43号。
I live in 42. Mr. Quill lived in 43.

2462
02:28:58,160 --> 02:29:00,730
如果奎尔先生从大厅出来，
Would Mr. Quill, coming up from the lobby...

2463
02:29:00,730 --> 02:29:04,930
走回他的房间，是不是必定经过那个滑道口？
have to pass by the mouth of that chute 
on the way to his room?

2464
02:29:04,930 --> 02:29:05,530
是的。
Yes.

2465
02:29:05,530 --> 02:29:09,260
那么当他经过时，是不是很容易
把什么东西丢入那个滑道？
Would it be very easy for him to drop 
something into that chute as he passed?

2466
02:29:09,260 --> 02:29:10,130
是的。
Yes.

2467
02:29:10,140 --> 02:29:14,100
你是否有的时候也到
下面的洗衣房去看看呢？
Have you ever had occasion to go 
down into the laundry at any time?

2468
02:29:14,110 --> 02:29:17,510
是的，我的工作之一就是
在衣服洗完烘干之后，
Yes. Part of my job is to sort 
various pieces of laundry...

2469
02:29:17,510 --> 02:29:20,100
将送洗的衣服分类整好。
as they come out of the wash-and-dry machine.

2470
02:29:20,110 --> 02:29:23,260
你能不能告诉法庭，
在奎尔先生被杀后的第二天，
Would you tell the court what you found 
among those pieces of laundry...

2471
02:29:23,260 --> 02:29:25,770
你在这些衣服里面发现了什么？
the day after Mr. Quill was killed?

2472
02:29:25,790 --> 02:29:28,120
我发现了一条女人的内裤。
I found a pair of women's panties.

2473
02:29:28,120 --> 02:29:31,190
- 你把内裤怎么样了？
- 我把它扔到了破衣箱里。
- And what did you do with them?
- I threw them in the rag bin.

2474
02:29:31,190 --> 02:29:34,620
你什么时候意识到这条内裤的重要性的？
When did you learn the significance 
of those panties?

2475
02:29:34,630 --> 02:29:37,660
这儿，今天上午，在法庭里。
Here. This morning, in the courtroom.

2476
02:29:37,660 --> 02:29:39,760
然后你就回家把它从破衣箱里取了出来？
And then you went home 
and got them out of the rag bin?

2477
02:29:39,760 --> 02:29:40,330
是的。
Yes.

2478
02:29:40,330 --> 02:29:42,300
你把它带来了吗？
Did you bring them with you?

2479
02:29:42,300 --> 02:29:43,410
是的。
Yes.

2480
02:29:45,510 --> 02:29:48,940
我提供这件女性内衣…
I offer this article of lingerie...

2481
02:29:48,940 --> 02:29:51,370
作为辩方的一号呈堂证物。
as Exhibit Number One for the defense.

2482
02:29:51,380 --> 02:29:55,710
它是白色的，边上有花边，
They're white, they have lace up the side...

2483
02:29:55,720 --> 02:29:58,080
被严重撕坏，
and they're badly torn...

2484
02:29:58,080 --> 02:30:01,920
像是被一双有力的大手扯烂的。
as if they've been ripped apart by powerful hands.

2485
02:30:01,920 --> 02:30:04,260
标签上印着――
The label reads...

2486
02:30:05,290 --> 02:30:07,990
“亚利桑那凤凰城时髦商店”。
"Smart Shop, Phoenix, Arizona."

2487
02:30:07,990 --> 02:30:11,430
如果没有反对，该物品将被接受为证物。
If there is no objection, the exhibit 
will be received in evidence.

2488
02:30:11,430 --> 02:30:14,620
- 我问完了，皮兰特小姐。
- 你曾和罗德威克先生交谈过…
- That's all, Miss Pilant.
- Do you ever talk to Mr. Lodwick...

2489
02:30:14,630 --> 02:30:16,670
巴尼・奎尔之死吗？
about the death of Barney Quill?

2490
02:30:16,670 --> 02:30:19,700
是的，在奎尔先生被杀后，他来过旅店几次。
He came to the hotel several times 
after Mr. Quill was killed.

2491
02:30:19,710 --> 02:30:23,100
你是否告诉过罗德威克先生你不相信
巴尼・奎尔强奸了曼尼昂夫人？
Did you tell Mr. Lodwick that you didn't 
believe Barney Quill raped Mrs. Manion?

2492
02:30:23,110 --> 02:30:27,310
- 是的，我是这样告诉他的。
- 皮兰特小姐，你和被告律师比格勒先生谈过吗？
- Yes, I told him that.
- Did you ever talk to Mr. Biegler?

2493
02:30:27,310 --> 02:30:27,910
是的。
Yes.

2494
02:30:27,910 --> 02:30:30,360
内容是否也和奎尔被杀有关？
Was this also in connection 
with the shooting of Quill?

2495
02:30:30,360 --> 02:30:30,710
是的。
Yes.

2496
02:30:30,720 --> 02:30:33,260
你是否告诉过他你不相信
巴尼・奎尔强奸了曼尼昂夫人？
Did you tell him you didn't believe 
Barney Quill had raped Mrs. Manion?

2497
02:30:33,260 --> 02:30:33,550
是的。
Yes.

2498
02:30:33,550 --> 02:30:35,680
- 你和他谈过几次？
- 两次。
- How many times did you talk to him?
- Twice.

2499
02:30:35,690 --> 02:30:37,980
- 最后一次是什么时候？
- 昨天晚上。
- When was the last time?
- Last night.

2500
02:30:37,990 --> 02:30:40,390
那么你现在改变主意啦？
你现在相信…
And have you now changed your mind?
Do you now believe...

2501
02:30:40,390 --> 02:30:42,760
巴尼・奎尔强奸过曼尼昂夫人？
Barney Quill raped Mrs. Manion?

2502
02:30:42,760 --> 02:30:44,920
我现在不知道，我想有可能吧。
I don't know now. I think he might have.

2503
02:30:44,930 --> 02:30:47,090
你什么时候改变的主意？昨天晚上？
When did you change your mind? Last night?

2504
02:30:47,100 --> 02:30:50,070
- 不，是在这儿，今天上午。
- 什么时候给你的裤子？
- No, it was here, this morning.
- When were you given the panties?

2505
02:30:50,070 --> 02:30:52,360
- 昨天晚上吗？
- 不，且慢！先且慢！
- Was that last night?
- Just wait a minute!

2506
02:30:52,370 --> 02:30:55,340
用适当的形式反对，比格勒先生。
Use the proper form of objection, Mr. Biegler.

2507
02:30:55,340 --> 02:30:59,430
转念一想，我不反对了。
我想让陪审团听听她的回答。
On second thought, I don't object.
I'd like the jury to hear her answer.

2508
02:30:59,450 --> 02:31:02,040
- 证人可以回答。
- 不。
- The witness may answer.
- No.

2509
02:31:02,050 --> 02:31:04,980
没人在昨天晚上或任何其他时候给过我内裤，
I was not given the panties last night 
or at any other time.

2510
02:31:04,980 --> 02:31:07,920
- 我自己发现的，就像我刚才说的那样。
- 你是事实上知道…
- I found them exactly as I said.
- Do you know for a fact...

2511
02:31:07,920 --> 02:31:10,890
巴尼・奎尔把那条内裤
丢进了滑道呢，还只是你的推测？
that Barney Quill dropped the panties
down the chute, or did you assume it?

2512
02:31:10,890 --> 02:31:13,420
- 我推测的。
- 你有没有想过有可能某个其他的人…
- I assumed it.
- Had you thought maybe someone else...

2513
02:31:13,430 --> 02:31:16,990
把内裤放那儿的，一个想让内裤
在洗衣房被发现的人？
might have put the panties there
who wanted them found in the laundry?

2514
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:18,500
我还没那样想过。
I hadn't thought of that.

2515
02:31:18,500 --> 02:31:22,430
在比格勒先生的所谓
“无法抑制的冲动”的控制之下，
And in the grip of what Mr. Biegler 
might call irresistible impulse...

2516
02:31:22,440 --> 02:31:25,160
你气冲冲地拿着内裤跑到这儿，
目的是想拷问…
you rushed in here with the panties
because you wanted to crucify...

2517
02:31:25,170 --> 02:31:27,260
已故的巴尼・奎尔的人格，是不是这样？
the dead Barney Quill, isn't that true?

2518
02:31:27,260 --> 02:31:30,260
- 不，我想这是我的责任……
- 你的自尊心受到了伤害，是不是？
- No, I thought it was my duty--
- Your pride was hurt, wasn't it?

2519
02:31:30,260 --> 02:31:33,280
- 我不明白你在说什么。
- 法官大人，他想把证人搞糊涂了。
- I don't know what you mean.
- He's trying to confuse the witness.

2520
02:31:33,280 --> 02:31:35,850
让他问她能理解的问题。
Let him ask her a question she can understand.

2521
02:31:35,850 --> 02:31:39,940
是的，丹瑟先生，我自己也想知道你的用意所在。
Yes, Mr. Dancer. I myself would like 
to know what you're driving at.

2522
02:31:39,950 --> 02:31:43,390
皮兰特小姐，当你发现了那条内裤，
Miss Pilant, when you found the panties...

2523
02:31:43,390 --> 02:31:46,720
你的第一个念头是巴尼・奎尔
可能强奸了曼尼昂夫人呢，
was your first thought that Barney Quill 
might have raped Mrs. Manion...

2524
02:31:46,730 --> 02:31:50,730
还是他可能和曼尼昂夫人有了一腿？
or was it that he might have been
stepping out with Mrs. Manion?

2525
02:31:50,730 --> 02:31:52,890
他什么意思，我不知道他什么意思。
I don't know what he means.

2526
02:31:52,900 --> 02:31:57,560
丹瑟先生，我再一次要求你，
问证人直接的问题。
Mr. Dancer, once again I must ask you to 
put straight questions to the witness.

2527
02:31:57,570 --> 02:32:01,100
这个就是直接的问题，法官大人：
Here is a straight question, Your Honor.

2528
02:32:01,110 --> 02:32:03,870
皮兰特小姐，你是巴尼・奎尔的情人吗？
Miss Pilant, are you Barney Quill's mistress?

2529
02:32:03,880 --> 02:32:05,870
不！不，我不是！
No. No, I was not!

2530
02:32:05,880 --> 02:32:07,970
在雷鸣湾人人都知道你和奎尔住在一起。
It's common knowledge in Thunder Bay 
you were living with Quill.

2531
02:32:07,980 --> 02:32:12,050
- 这不是事实。巴尼・奎尔是……
- 是什么，皮兰特小姐？
- That's not true. Barney Quill was--
- Was what, Miss Pilant?

2532
02:32:12,050 --> 02:32:15,720
巴尼・奎尔是什么，皮兰特小姐？
Barney Quill was what, Miss Pilant?

2533
02:32:16,720 --> 02:32:19,680
巴尼・奎尔是我的父亲。
Barney Quill was my father.

2534
02:32:30,740 --> 02:32:32,960
没有问题了。
No more questions.

2535
02:32:32,970 --> 02:32:34,970
我没有问题。
That's all for me.

2536
02:32:34,970 --> 02:32:37,970
证人可以退下了。
The witness may step down.

2537
02:32:37,980 --> 02:32:40,670
现在休庭15分钟，随后，
We will recess for 15 minutes, after which...

2538
02:32:40,680 --> 02:32:43,080
我们将聆听双方的总结陈词。
we will hear the closing arguments.

2539
02:32:43,080 --> 02:32:47,540
如果有可能，我希望陪审团
在黄昏之前作出裁决。
If possible, I would like to charge 
the jury before nightfall.

2540
02:33:03,260 --> 02:33:05,570
你想他们会一直弄到深夜吗？
Think they're gonna stay out all night?

2541
02:33:20,590 --> 02:33:23,550
谁能不能说点什么？
Can't somebody say something?

2542
02:33:24,960 --> 02:33:27,550
你想让我说什么，梅达，亲爱的？
What do you want me to say, Maida, darling?

2543
02:33:27,560 --> 02:33:30,890
跟我说我们会赢。
Tell me we're gonna win.

2544
02:33:30,900 --> 02:33:34,930
我还指望着拿到中尉的期票呢。
I'm counting on getting that 
promissory note from the lieutenant.

2545
02:33:34,930 --> 02:33:39,260
我希望可以靠它先借点钱。
我需要一台新的打字机。
I hope I can borrow some money on it.
I need a new typewriter.

2546
02:33:39,260 --> 02:33:43,500
有一半时间，我的打字机
打不出“第”和“事”。
Half the time, the "p" and the "f" 
don't strike on mine.

2547
02:33:43,510 --> 02:33:46,260
“第一部分当事人”有时被打成…
"Party of the first part" sometimes comes out...

2548
02:33:46,260 --> 02:33:48,800
“一部分当人”。
"arty of the irst art."

2549
02:33:48,810 --> 02:33:51,640
根本没道理嘛，让人哭笑不得。
Doesn't make sense. It's embarrassing.

2550
02:33:51,650 --> 02:33:54,120
“一部分当人”？
"Arty of the irst art"?

2551
02:33:54,120 --> 02:33:56,350
我有点喜欢这个，
I kind of like that.

2552
02:33:56,360 --> 02:33:58,880
很有意味。
Has a ring to it.

2553
02:34:01,390 --> 02:34:04,490
十二个人走进个房间。
Twelve people go off into a room.

2554
02:34:05,600 --> 02:34:09,630
十二个不同的头脑，
十二种不同的心情，
Twelve different minds, 
twelve different hearts...

2555
02:34:09,640 --> 02:34:13,100
十二条不同的生活轨迹；
and twelve different walks of life.

2556
02:34:13,110 --> 02:34:17,110
十二双眼睛和耳朵，有不同的形状和大小。
Twelve sets of eyes, ears, shapes and sizes.

2557
02:34:17,110 --> 02:34:20,110
这十二个人，
And these twelve people...

2558
02:34:20,110 --> 02:34:23,310
被要求对另一个人作出判决，
are asked to judge another human being...

2559
02:34:23,320 --> 02:34:26,850
这个人也完全不同于他们，
就像他们之间互不相同。
as different from them 
as they are from each other.

2560
02:34:26,850 --> 02:34:30,510
而在他们判决时，
他们必须变成一个头脑――
And in their judgment, 
they must become of one mind.

2561
02:34:30,520 --> 02:34:33,350
一致同意。
Unanimous.

2562
02:34:33,360 --> 02:34:37,760
这是人类混乱不堪的心灵
所能做到的奇迹之一，
That's one of the miracles of man's 
disorganized soul that they can do it.

2563
02:34:38,800 --> 02:34:41,290
而且在大多数情况下，做得不错。
And most instances, do it right well.

2564
02:34:42,970 --> 02:34:46,140
上帝保佑陪审员们。
God bless juries.

2565
02:34:46,970 --> 02:34:50,030
我不知道要是我在陪审团里，我会怎么做。
I don't know what I'd do if I were on that jury.

2566
02:34:53,280 --> 02:34:55,580
我真的不知道。
I really don't know.

2567
02:34:56,720 --> 02:34:58,240
你呢？
Do you?

2568
02:35:02,690 --> 02:35:04,690
我喜欢那个，保利。
I loved that, Paulie.

2569
02:35:04,690 --> 02:35:08,690
我喜欢那什么“卑微的地方律师”之说，
I loved that "humble country lawyer" bit.

2570
02:35:08,690 --> 02:35:11,920
你让丹瑟【舞者】先生翩翩起舞了。
You had Mr. Dancer dancing.

2571
02:35:11,930 --> 02:35:13,930
我担心他会跳到最后。
I'm afraid he got in the last dance.

2572
02:35:13,930 --> 02:35:16,370
他的总结是我听过的最好的法庭总结陈词。
That's the best summary I've ever heard 
in a courtroom.

2573
02:35:16,370 --> 02:35:19,670
我还是更喜欢你的，保利。
I liked yours much better, Paulie.

2574
02:35:24,260 --> 02:35:27,140
你非得弹那玩意儿吗？
你不会弹《丹尼小子》…
Do you have to play that stuff?
Can't you play "Danny Boy"...

2575
02:35:27,150 --> 02:35:29,640
或《甜蜜的茵尼斯弗利岛》？
or "Sweet Isle of Innisfree"?

2576
02:35:43,330 --> 02:35:47,560
保罗・比格勒办公室。
好的，先生，这就过去。
Paul Biegler's office.
Yes, sir. Right away.

2577
02:35:47,570 --> 02:35:49,870
他们好了。
They're ready.

2578
02:35:59,260 --> 02:36:01,410
嗨，亲爱的。
Hey, sweetie.

2579
02:36:02,480 --> 02:36:03,760
接着走。
Go on.

2580
02:36:05,260 --> 02:36:07,440
- 陪审团已经进去了。
- 是啊，我听说了。
- The jury's coming in.
- Yeah, I heard.

2581
02:36:07,450 --> 02:36:10,520
你可以告诉我可爱的丈夫我在车里等他。
You can tell my loving husband 
I'll be waiting in the car.

2582
02:36:10,520 --> 02:36:13,720
- 你肯定他会出来？
- 噢，当然！
- You're sure he's gonna come out?
- Oh, sure!

2583
02:36:13,730 --> 02:36:17,390
他运气好，有的人运气就是好。
He's lucky. Some people have all the luck.

2584
02:36:17,400 --> 02:36:22,060
你可以告诉他我在等他把我踢到天国去。
You can tell him I'm waiting 
to get kicked to kingdom come.

2585
02:36:22,070 --> 02:36:24,130
噢！嘿，亲爱的，
Oh! Hey, sweetie...

2586
02:36:24,140 --> 02:36:27,000
我有件纪念品给你。
I have a souvenir for you.

2587
02:36:28,040 --> 02:36:30,130
呃，你最好还是自己留着。
You'd better keep that thing.

2588
02:36:30,140 --> 02:36:32,840
也许什么时候你又会用得着，谁知道呢。
You might need it again sometime. 
You never know.

2589
02:36:32,850 --> 02:36:35,070
是的，是不知道，对吗？
No, you don't, do you?

2590
02:36:35,080 --> 02:36:37,710
噢，我喜欢你，保利。
Oh, I like you, Paulie.

2591
02:36:44,060 --> 02:36:47,960
我提醒在场的各位不要打断判决过程，
I warn all those present not 
to interrupt the taking of the verdict.

2592
02:36:47,960 --> 02:36:50,530
一旦出现这样的迹象，我将中止判决，
I will stop the proceedings 
and clear the courtroom...

2593
02:36:50,530 --> 02:36:53,300
进行清场。
if there is any demonstration.

2594
02:37:01,840 --> 02:37:03,930
开始吧，书记官先生。
Proceed, Mr. Clerk.

2595
02:37:03,940 --> 02:37:06,600
陪审员们，你们是否已经就裁决取得一致意见？
Members of the jury, 
have you agreed upon a verdict...

2596
02:37:06,610 --> 02:37:10,110
- 如果是的话，谁是你们的代言人？
- 我们已经取得一致，我是陪审团主席。
- and if so, who will speak for you?
- We have. I'm the foreman.

2597
02:37:10,120 --> 02:37:12,420
被告起立。
The defendant will rise.

2598
02:37:14,850 --> 02:37:17,260
- 你们的裁决是什么？
- 我们认为被告…
- What is your verdict?
- We find the defendant...

2599
02:37:17,260 --> 02:37:20,090
无罪，理由是精神错乱。
not guilty by reason of insanity.

2600
02:37:25,360 --> 02:37:27,760
梅达给了你那张期票单，是吗？
Maida gave you that promissory note, didn't she?

2601
02:37:27,770 --> 02:37:30,730
就在这儿，就等我们快乐的委托人签字了。
Right here, ready to be signed by our happy client.

2602
02:37:31,840 --> 02:37:35,770
你知道，有一阵子我觉得透过威士忌酒瓶，
这世界看上去更加美好，
You know, I used to think the world 
looked better through a glass of whisky.

2603
02:37:35,770 --> 02:37:37,940
但其实不然。
It doesn't.

2604
02:37:37,940 --> 02:37:41,070
我想我会保持这样的状态，感觉不错。
I think I'll keep it this way. Looks nice.

2605
02:37:41,910 --> 02:37:45,260
嗯，通过这个案子，我有一个收获――
Well, I got one good thing out of this case--

2606
02:37:45,260 --> 02:37:49,280
一个新的法律伙伴，如果他也同意的话。
a new law partner, if it's all right with him.

2607
02:37:49,290 --> 02:37:53,150
把他的名字刻在你的招牌上，
他会感到非常自豪的。
He'd be mighty proud to have his name 
on a shingle with yours.

2608
02:38:22,960 --> 02:38:26,320
我猜你们是来找曼尼昂中尉的，
是吗，比格勒先生？
I guess you're looking for Lt. Manion, 
aren't you, Mr. Biegler?

2609
02:38:26,330 --> 02:38:28,720
他让我把这个条子转给你。
He gave me this note for you.

2610
02:38:29,900 --> 02:38:34,020
我真替曼尼昂夫人难过，她哭得厉害。
I felt real sorry for Mrs. Manion.
She was crying.

2611
02:38:34,030 --> 02:38:37,800
他们把这儿搞得一团糟，是不是？
嗯，我得忙我的去了。
Left a mess, didn't they?
Well, we'd better get busy here.

2612
02:38:37,800 --> 02:38:41,840
“亲爱的比格勒先生，
非常抱歉我的突然离去，
"Dear Mr. Biegler, 
so sorry that I had to leave suddenly.

2613
02:38:41,840 --> 02:38:44,870
因为我的‘无法抑制的冲动’症又犯了。
I was seized by an irresistible impulse.

2614
02:38:44,880 --> 02:38:47,540
弗雷德里克・曼尼昂。”
Frederick Manion."

2615
02:38:47,550 --> 02:38:50,570
这下我们究竟怎么去见梅达呢？
How in the world are we gonna face Maida?

2616
02:38:51,780 --> 02:38:55,880
杜松子酒。我就知道那家伙有什么地方不对劲。
Gin. I knew there was something wrong with that guy.

2617
02:38:55,890 --> 02:38:58,620
还从没见过一个喝杜松子酒的你可以信任的。
Never saw a gin drinker yet you could trust.

2618
02:38:59,730 --> 02:39:02,820
搭档，你说我们去见我们的
第一位委托人怎么样？
Partner, what do you say 
we go and see our first client?

2619
02:39:02,830 --> 02:39:05,020
- 那会是谁？
- 玛丽・皮兰特。
- Who might that be?
- Mary Pilant.

2620
02:39:05,030 --> 02:39:07,720
我们去帮她打理巴尼・奎尔的财产。
We're gonna administer Barney Quill's estate.

2621
02:39:07,730 --> 02:39:11,570
这就是我说的“善恶有报，人人难逃”。
Now, that's what I call poetic justice for everybody.
