1
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:18,452
Thank you very much, sir.

2
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:20,746
You did a wonderful job. Wonderful.

3
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:23,459
Shh. Shh.

4
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:24,459
We did it, Pete. We did it.

5
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:28,756
- For a moment, we had our doubts.
- Shh.

6
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:32,259
To continue, you've listened
to a long and complex case...

7
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,136
murder in the first degree.

8
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:39,136
A premeditated murder is the most serious
charge tried in our criminal courts.

9
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:40,018
You've listened to the testimony.

10
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:43,018
You've had the law read to you
and interpreted as it applies in this case.

11
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:48,021
It's now your duty to sit down and try
and separate the facts from the fancy.

12
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:52,280
One man is dead.
Another man's life is at stake.

13
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,280
If there's a reasonable doubt in your minds
as to the guilt of the accused...

14
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,367
a reasonable doubt...

15
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,247
then you must bring me
a verdict of not guilty.

16
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,208
Now if, however,
there's no reasonable doubt...

17
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:08,208
then you must in good conscience
find the accused guilty.

18
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:13,212
However you decide,
your verdict must be unanimous.

19
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:16,425
In the event
that you find the accused guilty...

20
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:20,306
the bench will not entertain
a recommendation for mercy.

21
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:23,306
The death sentence
is mandatory in this case.

22
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:27,316
You're faced with a grave responsibility.
Thank you, gentlemen.

23
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,316
The alternate jurors are excused.

24
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,360
The jury will now retire.

25
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,360
Try this one. See if I can get it...

26
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,697
It's a muggy day.

27
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,132
Hey. Oh, oh.

28
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:02,132
- Piece of gum?
- No, thanks.

29
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,302
This thing is...

30
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,471
- Huh?
- ...move it.

31
00:05:07,723 --> 00:05:09,723
- Come on, I'll give you a hand.
- Give me a hand with that.

32
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,942
That's it.

33
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,651
- You know something?
- Yeah?

34
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,487
I called the weather bureau this morning.

35
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,487
This is gonna be
the hottest day of the year.

36
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,156
Could be.

37
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:26,156
Boy, you'd think they'd at least
air-condition these places.

38
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:29,158
- What is your name, sir?
- Oh, it's, uh - That one, yeah.

39
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,081
Thank you very much.

40
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,081
Okay, gentlemen, everybody's here.

41
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,836
Now, if there's anything you want,
I'll be right outside the door.

42
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,601
- Just knock.
- Okay, thanks. We will.

43
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,601
Good morning.

44
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,437
I never knew they locked the door.

45
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,437
Sure they lock the door.
What'd you think?

46
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,690
I don't know.
It just never occurred to me.

47
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:03,613
What's that for?

48
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,574
Oh, I thought we might want
to vote by ballot.

49
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:08,495
Great idea. Maybe we can
get him elected senator.

50
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,495
Just in case, you know.

51
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,750
- Î—ow'd you like it?
- Oh, I don't know.

52
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,713
It was pretty interesting.

53
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,713
Yeah? I almost fell asleep.

54
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:24,425
I mean, I've never been
on a jury before.

55
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:27,305
No? I've sat on many juries.

56
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:31,305
What gets me is the way
those lawyers talk and talk and talk...

57
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,307
even when it's an open-and-shut case
like this one.

58
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,353
Did you ever hear
so much talk about nothin'?

59
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,314
Well, I guess they're entitled.

60
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,314
Yeah. They're entitled.
It's the system, but...

61
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:45,154
If you ask me, I'd slap those tough kids
down before they start any trouble.

62
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,154
It would save us a lot of time and money.

63
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,324
- Hey, let's get started, huh?
- That's a good idea.

64
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:51,661
- Yeah, let's get goin', huh?
- We probably all got things to do here.

65
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,661
I figured we'd start out with a five-minute break.
There's one gentleman in the bathroom.

66
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,790
- Mr. Foreman.
- Huh?

67
00:06:55,831 --> 00:06:58,709
- Are, uh - Are we gonna sit in order?
- Gee, I don't know.

68
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,466
I, uh - Well, I guess so.

69
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,009
Uh, you're in my seat.

70
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,009
- Oh. Excuse me.
- That's all right.

71
00:07:11,555 --> 00:07:13,555
Hey, that's not a bad view, huh?

72
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,480
What did you think of the case?

73
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,480
I mean, it had a lot of interest for me.

74
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,608
No real... dead spots.
You know what I mean?

75
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,156
I tell you, we were lucky
to get a murder case.

76
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,156
I figured us for an assault or burglary.

77
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,036
Boy, they can be the dullest.

78
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,036
Hey.

79
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,081
That the Woolworth Building?

80
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,081
That's right.

81
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,084
Isn't that funny?

82
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,213
You know, I've lived here all my life.
I've never been inside that.

83
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,213
If you had to sort out all that junk...

84
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,382
Like that thing with the movies.

85
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,550
- Yeah. You can say that again.
- And what about that business with the knife?

86
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,598
I mean, asking grown-up people
to believe that kind of jazz, huh?

87
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,142
Well, I expected that.
You know what we're dealing with.

88
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,142
Yeah, I guess so.

89
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,064
Well, your horn works.
Now try your lights.

90
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,064
- What do you got, a cold?
- And how.

91
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,608
These hot-weather colds can kill you.

92
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:08,404
I can hardly touch my nose.
You know what I mean?

93
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:11,033
I sure do. I just got over one.

94
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,033
Aw, come on. Mr.
Foreman, let's go here, huh?

95
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,579
Well, that guy's still in the bathroom.

96
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,499
Hey, what's new? I didn't get a chance
to see a paper this morning.

97
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,499
Hmm?

98
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,170
I was only wondering
how the market closed.

99
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,170
You got a seat on the Exchange?

100
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,798
I'm a broker.

101
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:32,261
I run a messenger service -
the Beck and Call Company.

102
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,261
The name is my wife's idea.

103
00:08:34,471 --> 00:08:38,184
Got 37 men working.
Started with nothing.

104
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,184
Okay, men, let's take our seats, huh?

105
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,442
Yeah, we can all get outta here
pretty quick, huh?

106
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:49,442
I don't know about the rest of you, but I happen
to have tickets to that ball game tonight.

107
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,655
Yanks and Cleveland.

108
00:08:51,655 --> 00:08:53,533
Yeah, we got this kid,
Modjelewski, in there.

109
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,284
Ooh, he's a real bull, this kid.

110
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,284
You know - Phoom!

111
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,495
A real jug handle. You know?

112
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,167
Phoom!

113
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,167
You're a real baseball fan, aren't you?
Huh? Yeah.

114
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,129
Where do we sit here?

115
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:09,129
Well, I thought we'd sit in order,
you know, by jury numbers.

116
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,298
One, two, three, four, five -
so on, around the table.

117
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,135
If that's okay with you gentlemen.

118
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,135
- Sure.
- What's the difference?

119
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:17,303
- I think it's reasonable to sit in order.
- Let it be.

120
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,432
- Number 12. Do I sit down here?
- Yeah. That's 12. We go around...

121
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:23,104
- We start with you. One, right?
- One, yeah. Two, three, four, five, six.

122
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,104
What was your impression
of the prosecuting attorney?

123
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,317
Okay. Two. You're two.

124
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,317
I beg pardon?

125
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:32,567
I thought he was really sharp, the way
he handled all those points one by one.

126
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,033
Logical sequence.
I was very impressed.

127
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:39,033
I think he - he did an expert job.

128
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,120
A lot of drive too, you know?
Real drive.

129
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,206
- Okay, fellas, can we hold it down a minute?
- Sure.

130
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,043
Uh, fellas.

131
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:49,043
Say, we'd like to get started.
Gentleman at the window.

132
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,173
- We'd like to get started.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

133
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:57,179
Pretty tough to figure, isn't it?
Kid kills his father - bing, just like that.

134
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,179
Aw, listen, you analyze the figures,
you'll see it happens all the time.

135
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,849
They let those kids
run wild up there.

136
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,645
Well, maybe it serves 'em right.
You know what I mean?

137
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,313
Is - Is everyone here?

138
00:10:06,313 --> 00:10:08,232
The old man is inside.

139
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,232
Oh. Would you, uh,
knock on the door for him?

140
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,943
You a Yankee fan?

141
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:14,447
No. Baltimore.

142
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:16,243
- Baltimore?
- Yeah.

143
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,243
That's like being hit in the head
with a crowbar once a day.

144
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:23,538
Who have they got?

145
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,375
No, I mean, who have they got
besides good groundskeepers?

146
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,003
Say, uh, we'd like to get started.

147
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:31,003
Oh, forgive me, gentlemen.
I - I didn't mean to keep you waiting.

148
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,716
Baltimore?

149
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,594
Okay, gentlemen,
if I can have your attention.

150
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,594
You fellas can handle this thing
any way that you want to.

151
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,225
I'm, um - You know,
I'm not gonna make any rules.

152
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:45,225
Uh, we can, well, discuss it first
and, uh, then vote on it.

153
00:10:45,602 --> 00:10:48,355
That's, of course, uh -
That's, uh, one way.

154
00:10:48,355 --> 00:10:51,355
And, uh, well, we can
vote on it right now, and...

155
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,400
I think it's customary
to take a preliminary vote.

156
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:57,657
Yeah, let's - Let's vote. Who knows?
Maybe we all can get outta here, huh?

157
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,451
Uh-huh.

158
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:02,451
Okay, then I think that, uh...

159
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,581
Of course you know that we have
a first-degree murder charge here...

160
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,581
and if we vote the accused guilty...

161
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,086
uh, we've got to send him
to the chair.

162
00:11:11,086 --> 00:11:14,086
- Um, that's mandatory.
- I think we know that.

163
00:11:14,923 --> 00:11:16,759
- Let's see who's where.
- We might as well.

164
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,759
- Okay. Uh, anyone doesn't want to vote?
- All right with me.

165
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:26,436
Okay. Then, uh, just remember that this
has to be 12 to nothing either way.

166
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,436
Um, that's the law.

167
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:30,105
Okay, are we ready?

168
00:11:30,105 --> 00:11:33,105
Now, all those voting guilty,
please raise your hands.

169
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:40,113
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

170
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,620
eight, nine, 10, 11.

171
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,620
Okay. That's 11 guilty.

172
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,293
Those voting not guilty.

173
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,293
One. Right.

174
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,461
That's 11 guilty. One not guilty.

175
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,341
Well, now we know where we are.

176
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:01,054
Boy, oh, boy. There's always one.

177
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,054
So, what do we do now?

178
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,351
Well, I guess we talk.

179
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,351
Boy, oh, boy.

180
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,066
You really think he's innocent?

181
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,066
I don't know.

182
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,654
I mean, you sat in court with the rest of us.
You heard what we did.

183
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,654
The kid's a dangerous killer.
You could see it.

184
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,573
He's 18 years old.

185
00:12:21,573 --> 00:12:23,573
Well, that's old enough. Î—e...

186
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,495
He stabbed his own father
four inches into the chest.

187
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,495
They proved it
a dozen different ways in court.

188
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,458
Would you like me to list them for you?

189
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,458
No.

190
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,004
Then what do you want?

191
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,004
- I just want to talk.
- What's there to talk about?

192
00:12:38,006 --> 00:12:39,006
Eleven men in here think he's guilty.

193
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,426
No one had to think about it twice
except you.

194
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,056
I want to ask you something.
Do you believe his story?

195
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,056
I don't know whether I believe it or not.
Maybe I don't.

196
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,519
So how come you vote not guilty?

197
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,519
Well, there were 11 votes for guilty.

198
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,356
It's not easy to raise my hand
and send a boy off to die...

199
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:56,356
without talking about it first.

200
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,238
- Well, now, who says it's easy?
- No one.

201
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,238
What, just because I voted fast?

202
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,490
I honestly think the guy's guilty.

203
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,870
You couldn't change my mind
if you talked for a hundred years.

204
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,456
I'm not trying to change your mind.
It's just that...

205
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,456
We're talking about somebody's life here.

206
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,792
We can't decide it in five minutes.
Supposing we're wrong.

207
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,462
"Supposing we're wrong."

208
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,462
Supposing this whole building
should fall down on my head.

209
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,384
- You can suppose anything.
- That's right.

210
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,219
Look, what's the difference
how long it takes?

211
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,219
Suppose we do it in five minutes.
So what?

212
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,099
Let's take an hour.

213
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,099
The ball game doesn't start till 8:00.

214
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:33,065
Hmm?

215
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,065
Who's got something to say?

216
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,485
I'm willing to sit for an hour.

217
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,279
Great. I heard
a pretty good story last night.

218
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,073
That's not why we're sitting here.

219
00:13:45,073 --> 00:13:48,073
All right, then you tell me.
What are we sitting here for?

220
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,706
I don't know. Maybe no reason.

221
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:56,251
Look, this kid's been kicked around
all of his life...

222
00:13:56,251 --> 00:14:00,251
you know, born in a slum,
mother dead since he was nine.

223
00:14:00,255 --> 00:14:02,255
He lived for a year and a half
in an orphanage when his...

224
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:05,549
his father was serving a jail term
for forgery.

225
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,553
It's not a very happy beginning.

226
00:14:07,971 --> 00:14:10,182
He's a - a wild, angry kid.

227
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,182
That's all he's ever been.
And you know why?

228
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:15,772
'Cause he's been hit on the head
by somebody once a day every day.

229
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,066
He's had a -
He's had a pretty miserable 18 years.

230
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:21,066
I - I just think we owe him a few words.
That's all.

231
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,110
I don't mind telling you this, mister.
We don't owe him a thing.

232
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:27,739
He got a fair trial, didn't he?
What do you think that trial cost?

233
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,078
- He's lucky he got it. You know what I mean?
- You know it.

234
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,078
Now, look, we're all grown-ups in here.

235
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,457
We heard the facts, didn't we?

236
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:39,336
You're not gonna tell me that we're supposed
to believe this kid, knowing what he is.

237
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,336
Listen, I've lived among them
all my life.

238
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:45,217
You can't believe a word they say.
You know that.

239
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,135
I mean, they're born liars.

240
00:14:47,135 --> 00:14:50,135
- Only an ignorant man can believe that.
- Now listen...

241
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,476
Do you think you were born
with a monopoly on the truth?

242
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:56,144
I think certain things should be
pointed out to this man.

243
00:14:56,144 --> 00:14:58,144
- Come on. This isn't Sunday.
- We don't need a sermon.

244
00:14:58,313 --> 00:15:00,313
- Come on.
- We have a job to do. Now let's do it.

245
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,488
Rice Pops.
It's a product I work on at the agency.

246
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:08,198
"The breakfast with the built-in bounce."

247
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,198
- I wrote that line.
- Very catchy.

248
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:12,160
- Yeah.
- Say, do you mind?

249
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,160
Oh, I'm sorry.

250
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,499
I have this habit of doodling.
Keeps me thinking clearly.

251
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,293
Yeah, we have all this work to do.

252
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:20,086
- There's no point staying here forever.
- Sorry.

253
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,086
Okay. Um...

254
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,259
perhaps if the gentleman down there
who's disagreeing with us...

255
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,259
Well, perhaps you could tell us why.
You know, let us know what you're thinking.

256
00:15:29,636 --> 00:15:32,097
And we might be able to show you
where you're mixed up.

257
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,097
Well, look, maybe -
Maybe this is an idea.

258
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,351
Now, I haven't given it much thought,
but it seems to me...

259
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:40,351
that it's up to the group of us to convince
this gentleman that he's wrong and we're right.

260
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:43,818
Now, maybe if we each took
a couple of minutes just to...

261
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,321
Well, it was just a quick idea.

262
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:47,321
No, no, no. That's a good one.

263
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:50,033
Uh, suppose we go
once around the table.

264
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,033
- I guess you're first.
- Oh.

265
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,873
Well, uh...

266
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,335
Well, it-it's hard to put into words.

267
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:02,335
I just think he's guilty.

268
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,005
I thought it was obvious
from the word "go."

269
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,005
I mean, nobody proved otherwise.

270
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,216
Nobody has to prove otherwise.

271
00:16:08,216 --> 00:16:10,216
The burden of proof's on the prosecution.

272
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:13,096
The defendant doesn't even
have to open his mouth.

273
00:16:13,096 --> 00:16:16,096
- That's in the Constitution.
- Oh, well, sure, I know that.

274
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,062
Uh, what I meant was, is...

275
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,062
Well, I just think he's guilty.

276
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,148
I-I mean, somebody saw him do it.

277
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:28,072
Okay. Uh, here's what I think,
and I have no personal feelings about this.

278
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:31,072
I just want to talk about facts.

279
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,240
Number one.

280
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:39,123
The old man lived downstairs under the room
where the killing took place.

281
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,123
At 10 minutes after 12:00
on the night of the killing...

282
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:45,087
he heard loud noises,
said it sounded like a fight.

283
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,048
And he heard the kid yell out,
"I'm gonna kill ya."

284
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,048
A second later,
he heard a body hit the floor.

285
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,220
Ran to the door, opened it up...

286
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,220
saw the kid running down the stairs
and out of the house.

287
00:16:54,721 --> 00:16:56,099
Called the police.

288
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:58,099
They came in, found the old man
with a knife in his chest.

289
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:02,187
The coroner fixed the time of death
around midnight.

290
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:05,187
Now these are facts.
You can't refute facts.

291
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,357
The kid is guilty.

292
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,609
I'm just as sentimental as the next fella.

293
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:13,657
I know he's only 18, but he's still
gotta pay for what he did.

294
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,201
I'm with you.

295
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,201
Okay. Are you finished?

296
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,372
- Yeah.
- Right. Next.

297
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,372
It is obvious, to me anyway,
that the boy's entire story was flimsy.

298
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,666
He claimed he was at the movies
during the time of the killing...

299
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,587
and yet, one hour later, he couldn't
remember the names of the films he saw...

300
00:17:27,587 --> 00:17:29,507
- or who played in them.
- That's right.

301
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,507
And no one saw him going in
or out of the theater.

302
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,594
Listen, what about the woman
across the street?

303
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,594
If her testimony don't prove it,
nothing does.

304
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,391
That's right. She was the one
who actually saw the killing.

305
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,391
- Now, fellas, please.
- Let's go in order here, huh?

306
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,230
Just a minute. Here's a woman...

307
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,230
Here's a woman who was lying in bed.
She can't sleep.

308
00:17:46,773 --> 00:17:48,773
She's dying with the heat.
You know what I mean?

309
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,694
Anyway, she looks out the window...

310
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:54,365
and right across the street she sees
the kid stick the knife into his father.

311
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:57,326
The time is 12:10 on the nose.

312
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,287
Everything fits.

313
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:01,204
Look, she's known the kid all his life.

314
00:18:01,204 --> 00:18:03,204
His window is right opposite hers
across the el tracks...

315
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,167
and she swore she saw him do it.

316
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,167
- Through the windows of the passing el train.
- Right.

317
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:12,174
This el train had no passengers on it.
It was just being moved downtown.

318
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:15,174
The lights were out, remember?
And they proved in court that, at night...

319
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,178
you can look through the windows
of an el train when the lights are out...

320
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,098
and see what's happening
on the other side.

321
00:18:20,098 --> 00:18:22,019
- They proved it.
- I'd like to ask you something.

322
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,019
You don't believe the boy's story.
How come you believe the woman's?

323
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,192
She's one of them too, isn't she?

324
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,192
You're a pretty smart fella, aren't you?

325
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,278
- Okay, gentlemen.
- Now, now.

326
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,073
- Now, gentlemen.
- Come on. Sit down. Sit down.

327
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,073
Oh, what's he so wise about?
I'm telling you.

328
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,038
- Okay, now come on.
- Now we're not gonna get anywhere fighting.

329
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,038
Whose turn is it next?

330
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,372
Oh, uh, his. Number five.

331
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,006
Okay, may I - Can I pass? It...

332
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,006
Well, uh, that's your privilege.

333
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,133
Uh, how about the next gentleman?

334
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:00,096
Oh. Well, uh, I don't know.

335
00:19:00,096 --> 00:19:04,096
I started to be convinced, you know,
very early in the case.

336
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:09,105
You see, I was looking for a motive.
That's very important.

337
00:19:09,105 --> 00:19:13,105
Because if you don't have a motive,
where's your case, right?

338
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,402
Anyway, that, uh, testimony
from those people...

339
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:19,571
in the apartment across the hall
from the kid's apartment...

340
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,036
that was very powerful.

341
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:24,036
Didn't they say something about a -
a fight and an argument...

342
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:29,417
between the old man and his son
around about, uh, 7:00 that night?

343
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:31,417
- I mean, I could be wrong, but I -
- It was 8:00.

344
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,089
It was 8:00. That's right.
They heard an argument.

345
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,089
They couldn't hear what it was about.

346
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,924
Then they heard
the father hit the boy twice.

347
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:40,012
Finally they saw the boy
run angrily out of the house.

348
00:19:41,012 --> 00:19:42,012
What does that prove?

349
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:46,434
Well, it don't exactly prove anything.
It's just part of the picture.

350
00:19:46,434 --> 00:19:49,434
Well, you said it provided a motive.
The prosecuting attorney said the same thing.

351
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,438
I don't think
that was a very strong motive.

352
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:55,443
This boy's been hit so many times in his
life that violence is practically a...

353
00:19:55,443 --> 00:19:57,443
It's a normal state of affairs with him.

354
00:19:57,904 --> 00:20:02,201
I just - I can't see two slaps in the face
provoking him into committing murder.

355
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,201
It may have been two too many.
Everyone has a breaking point.

356
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,332
Anything else?

357
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,045
- No.
- Okay.

358
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,045
Uh, how about you?

359
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,135
I don't know. It's all been said.

360
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,135
You can talk here forever.
It's still the same thing.

361
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:26,018
This kid is five for 0.

362
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:28,018
Well, look at his record.

363
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,271
When he was 10,
he was in children's court.

364
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,148
He threw a rock at a teacher.

365
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:35,148
When he was 15, he was in reform school.

366
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,444
He stole a car.

367
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,030
He's been arrested for mugging.

368
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,030
He was picked up twice for knife fighting.

369
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:44,115
Oh, yeah, they say
he's real handy with a knife.

370
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:47,163
Oh, this is a very fine boy.

371
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:50,163
Ever since he was five years old,
his father beat him up regularly.

372
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,249
- He used his fists.
- Well, so would I.

373
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,336
A kid like that?

374
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:57,009
It's these kids, the way they are nowadays.

375
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:03,009
When I was a kid,
I used to call my father "sir."

376
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,306
That's right. "Sir."

377
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,306
Do you ever hear a kid
call his father that any more?

378
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,349
Fathers don't seem to think
it's important any more.

379
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,065
- You got any kids?
- Three.

380
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:15,065
I got one.

381
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,784
Twenty-two years old.

382
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,246
When he was nine years old,
he ran away from a fight.

383
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:32,085
I saw it. I was so embarrassed
I almost threw up.

384
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:38,085
I said, "I'm gonna make a man out of you
if I have to break you in two trying."

385
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,135
Well, I made a man out of him.

386
00:21:44,135 --> 00:21:46,135
When he was 16, we had a fight.

387
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,688
Hit me in the jaw.
He was a big kid.

388
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:55,688
Haven't seen him for two years.

389
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:59,692
Kids.

390
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,241
Work your heart out.

391
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,241
Well, let's get going.

392
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,576
I think we're missing the point here.

393
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:13,499
This boy, let's say he's the product
of a broken home and a filthy neighborhood.

394
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:17,169
We can't help that. We're here to decide
whether he's innocent or guilty...

395
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,169
not to go into the reasons
why he grew up the way he did.

396
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,172
He was born in a slum.
Slums are breeding grounds for criminals.

397
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,926
I know it, and so do you.

398
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:29,723
It's no secret children from slum backgrounds
are potential menaces to society.

399
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,723
- Now I think -
- Brother, you can say that again.

400
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:34,603
The kids who crawl out of these places
are real trash.

401
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,603
- I don't want any part of them. I'm telling you.
- Listen, mister. Listen.

402
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:40,734
- I, uh - I've lived in a slum all my life.
- Wait a minute.

403
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:44,238
Please, I - I played in backyards
that were filled with garbage.

404
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:46,238
I mean, maybe you can still
smell it on me.

405
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,365
Now, listen, sonny.

406
00:22:47,782 --> 00:22:49,452
- Come on now.
- There's nothing personal about this.

407
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:51,078
- No, there was something personal.
- Aw, come on, fella. He didn't mean you.

408
00:22:52,078 --> 00:22:54,078
Let's not be so sensitive.

409
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:56,166
This sensitivity I can understand.

410
00:22:56,166 --> 00:23:00,166
Okay, look, let's stop the arguing.
We're only wasting time, and...

411
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:04,425
Look, your turn down there.
Let's go.

412
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:08,345
Oh, I didn't expect a turn. I thought
you were all gonna try to convince me.

413
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,181
- Wasn't that the idea?
- Check. That was the idea.

414
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:12,181
- Oh, I forgot about that. He's right.
- What difference does it make?

415
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,474
He's the one who's keeping us in here.
Let's hear what he's got to say.

416
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,688
Oh, now wait a minute.
We decided to do this a certain way.

417
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:19,397
I think we ought to stick to that way.

418
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:21,397
Oh, stop being a kid, will you?

419
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,483
- What do you mean "a kid"?
- What do you think I mean?

420
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,568
K-I-D. Kid.

421
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:31,535
What? Listen, just because I'm trying
to keep this thing organized?

422
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,535
Here, you take it.
You take on the responsibility.

423
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,705
I'll just - I'll keep my mouth shut.
That's all.

424
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,705
What are you getting so hot about?
Calm down, will you?

425
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,210
Don't tell me to calm down.

426
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,210
Here. You wanna take the chair,
just take the chair. That's all.

427
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,420
- Did you ever see such a thing?
- See if you can keep it running.

428
00:23:43,963 --> 00:23:45,008
- Listen, you think it's funny or something?
- Hey, forget it, fella.

429
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:47,008
The whole thing's unimportant.
Come on.

430
00:23:47,675 --> 00:23:50,675
- Unimportant? Oh, here, you try it.
- No, nobody wants to change.

431
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:52,722
You're doing a beautiful job.
Sit down.

432
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:55,643
Yeah, you're doing great.
Just great, fella.

433
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:57,479
You stay in there and pitch. You know?

434
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,191
All right. Let's hear from somebody.

435
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:06,191
Well, if you want me to tell you how I
feel about it, it's all right with me.

436
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,362
Boy, I don't care what you do.

437
00:24:08,571 --> 00:24:11,534
All right, I don't have anything brilliant.

438
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:13,534
I only know as much as you do.

439
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:17,580
According to the testimony,
the boy looks guilty. Maybe he is.

440
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:21,377
I sat there in court for six days
listening while the evidence built up.

441
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,171
Everybody sounded so positive, you know?

442
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,171
I-I began to get a peculiar feeling
about this trial.

443
00:24:26,714 --> 00:24:28,714
I mean, nothing is that positive.

444
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,095
There are a lot of questions
I'd have liked to ask.

445
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:33,095
I don't know. Maybe they wouldn't
have meant anything, but...

446
00:24:33,888 --> 00:24:35,888
I began to get the feeling
that the defense counsel...

447
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:38,519
wasn't conducting a thorough-enough
cross-examination.

448
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:41,519
I mean, he - he let too many things go by,
little things that...

449
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,817
What little things? Listen,
when these fellas don't ask questions...

450
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:47,403
it's because they know the answers already
and they figure they'll be hurt.

451
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:51,403
Maybe it's also possible for a lawyer
to be just plain stupid, isn't it?

452
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:52,406
I mean it's possible.

453
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,538
You sound like you met
my brother-in-law once.

454
00:24:57,538 --> 00:25:00,084
I - I kept putting myself
in the kid's place.

455
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,084
I'd have asked for another lawyer, I think.

456
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:06,295
I mean, if I was on trial for my life...

457
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:11,801
I'd want my lawyer to tear the prosecution
witnesses to shreds, or at least try to.

458
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:15,307
Look, there was one alleged eyewitness
to this killing.

459
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:19,307
Someone else claims he heard the killing,
saw the boy run out afterwards.

460
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,768
And there was a lot
of circumstantial evidence.

461
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:25,566
But actually, those two witnesses
were the entire case for the prosecution.

462
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,442
Supposing they're wrong.

463
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:29,319
What do you mean
supposing they're wrong?

464
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,279
What's the point
of having witnesses at all?

465
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,279
- Could they be wrong?
- What are you trying to say?

466
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,617
Those people sat on the stand under oath.

467
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,243
They're only people.
People make mistakes.

468
00:25:37,243 --> 00:25:38,243
Could they be wrong?

469
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:42,747
- Well, no, I don't think so.
- Do you know so?

470
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,667
Oh, come on.
Nobody can know a thing like that.

471
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:46,461
This isn't an exact science.

472
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:47,461
That's right. It isn't.

473
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,804
Okay, let - Let's get to the point.

474
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,473
What about the switch knife
they found in the old man's chest?

475
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,473
Uh, wait-wait a minute.
There's some people who haven't talked yet.

476
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,061
- Shouldn't we go in order?
- They'll get a chance to talk.

477
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,061
Be quiet a second, will you?

478
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,480
What about it, this...

479
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:10,402
the knife this fine upright boy
admitted buying the night of the killing?

480
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,402
Let's talk about it.

481
00:26:11,819 --> 00:26:14,155
All right, let's talk about it.
Let's get it in here and look at it.

482
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,155
I'd like to see it again.
Mr. Foreman?

483
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:19,161
- We all saw what it looks like.
- Why do we have to see it again?

484
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:21,161
The gentleman has a right
to see exhibits in evidence.

485
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:24,332
Say, could you bring us the knife?

486
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,336
- Knife?
- Yeah. Thank you.

487
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:31,336
The knife and the way it was bought
is pretty strong evidence, don't you think?

488
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,424
- I do.
- Good.

489
00:26:33,424 --> 00:26:35,010
Now, suppose we take these facts
one at a time.

490
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:39,010
One. The boy admitted going out of the house
at 8:00 on the night of the murder...

491
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,347
after being slapped several times
by his father.

492
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:44,185
No, no. No, he didn't say "slapped."
He said "punched."

493
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:46,185
There's a difference
between a slap and a punch.

494
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:49,357
After being hit several times
by his father.

495
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:51,357
Two. He went directly
to a neighborhood junk shop...

496
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,693
- where he bought one of those -
- Switch knives.

497
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:55,904
Switchblade knives.

498
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,865
This wasn't what you'd call
an ordinary knife.

499
00:26:57,865 --> 00:27:00,452
It had a very unusual carved handle
and blade.

500
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,037
The storekeeper who sold it to him...

501
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:05,037
said it was the only one of its kind
he had ever had in stock.

502
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:09,086
Three. He met some friends of his
in front of a tavern about 8:45.

503
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:10,086
Am I right so far?

504
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:12,671
- Yes, you are.
- You bet he is.

505
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:16,134
He talked with his friends for about
an hour, leaving them at 9:45.

506
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:19,134
During this time,
they saw the switch knife.

507
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,056
Four.

508
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,056
They identified the death weapon
in court...

509
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:26,144
as that very same knife.

510
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,022
Five. Î—e arrived home at about 10:00.

511
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,022
Now this is where the stories
offered by the State and the boy...

512
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:33,442
begin to diverge slightly.

513
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:36,113
He claims that he went to a movie
at about 11:30...

514
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:40,113
returning home at 3:10 to find his
father dead and himself arrested.

515
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:42,241
He also claims that
the two detectives who arrested him...

516
00:27:42,368 --> 00:27:44,368
threw him down a half a flight of stairs.

517
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:46,664
Now, what happened to the switch knife?

518
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:49,375
He claims that it fell through a hole
in his pocket on the way to the movies...

519
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:54,131
sometime between 11:30 and 3:10
and that he never saw it again.

520
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:56,131
Now there's a tale, gentlemen.

521
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:59,174
I think it's quite clear that the boy
never went to the movies that night.

522
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,761
No one in the house
saw him go out at 11:30.

523
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,390
No one at the theater identified him.

524
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,390
He couldn't even remember
the names of the pictures he saw.

525
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,355
- What actually happened is this.
- Thank you.

526
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,355
The boy stayed home,
had another fight with his father...

527
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,445
stabbed him to death and left the
house at 10 minutes after 12:00.

528
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:20,281
He even remembered to wipe the knife
clean of fingerprints.

529
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,281
Now are you trying to tell me
that this knife...

530
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,992
really fell through a hole
in the boy's pocket...

531
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:27,455
someone picked it up off the street,
went to the boy's house...

532
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:30,209
and stabbed his father with it
just to test its sharpness?

533
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,209
No. I'm just saying it's possible
the boy lost his knife...

534
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,294
and that somebody else stabbed his father
with a similar knife.

535
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:35,587
It's just possible.

536
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,384
Take a look at this knife.

537
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,384
It's a very unusual knife.

538
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,305
I've never seen one like it.

539
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:46,182
Neither had the storekeeper
who sold it to the boy.

540
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:49,182
Aren't you asking us to accept
a pretty incredible coincidence?

541
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,228
I'm just saying a coincidence is possible.

542
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,646
And I say it's not possible.

543
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:01,573
Where did that come from?

544
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,032
- Where'd you get that?
- It's the same knife.

545
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,032
What do you think you're doing?

546
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,327
Where did you get it?

547
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,327
I went out walking
for a couple of hours last night.

548
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:10,663
I walked through the boy's neighborhood.

549
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,749
I bought that at a little pawnshop
just two blocks from the boy's house.

550
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:15,378
It cost six dollars.

551
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:18,378
It's against the law
to buy or sell switchblade knives.

552
00:29:18,589 --> 00:29:20,589
That's right. I broke the law.

553
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:24,012
Listen, you pulled a real bright trick.
Now, supposing you tell me what it proves.

554
00:29:25,012 --> 00:29:27,012
Maybe there are 10 knives like that.
So what?

555
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,059
- Maybe there are.
- Well, what does it mean?

556
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:33,059
You found another knife like it.
What's that, the discovery of the age or something?

557
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,439
You mean you're asking us to believe
that somebody else did the stabbing...

558
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,733
with exactly the same kind of knife?

559
00:29:37,733 --> 00:29:38,068
The odds are a million-to-one.

560
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:41,068
- It's possible.
- But not very probable.

561
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,075
Okay, fellas, let's take our seats.

562
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:46,075
There's no point in standing around
all over the place.

563
00:29:48,744 --> 00:29:52,249
You know, it's interesting that he'd find a
knife exactly like the one the boy bought.

564
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:55,085
What's interesting about it?
"Interesting."

565
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:56,045
Well, I don't know.
I just thought it was interesting.

566
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,045
There are still 11 of us here
who think he's guilty.

567
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,299
- Right.
- What do you think you're gonna accomplish?

568
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,218
You're not gonna change anybody's mind.

569
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,218
So if you wanna be stubborn
and hang this jury, go ahead.

570
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,267
The kid will be tried again
and found guilty sure as he's born.

571
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,227
That's probably right.

572
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:15,227
So what are you gonna do?
You know, we could be here all night.

573
00:30:15,521 --> 00:30:18,521
It's only one night. A boy may die.

574
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:21,487
Well, why don't we just
set up house here, huh?

575
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:23,030
Someone send for Potsy the policeman
and get a pinochle deck...

576
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,030
and, uh, we'll just
sweat the whole thing out right here.

577
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:31,035
- I don't think he ought to joke about it.
- What do you want me to do about it?

578
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:34,163
Oh, listen! I don't see what all this stuff
about the knife's got to do with anything.

579
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,916
Somebody saw the kid stab his father.
What more do we need?

580
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,797
You guys can talk the ears right off my head.
You know what I mean?

581
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:43,592
I got three garages of mine goin' to pot
while you're talking.

582
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:45,344
So let's get done and get outta here.

583
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:48,344
The knife was very important to the
district attorney. He spent a whole day...

584
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:51,391
He's a 15th assistant or something.
What does he know about it?

585
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,391
Hey, let's hold it down.

586
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,147
These side arguments
are only slowing us up.

587
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,147
Well, what about it?

588
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,034
You're the only one.

589
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,034
I have a proposition
to make to all of you.

590
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:13,162
I'm gonna call for another vote.

591
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:20,374
I want you 11 men to vote
by secret written ballot.

592
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:22,671
I'll abstain.

593
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,675
If there are 11 votes for guilty,
I won't stand alone.

594
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:29,675
We'll take in a guilty verdict
to the judge right now.

595
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:34,931
But if anyone votes not guilty,
we stay here and talk it out.

596
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,980
Well, that's it.
If you want to try it, I'm ready.

597
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,526
All right. Let's do it the hard way.

598
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:44,526
Okay, that sounds fair.
Everyone agreed?

599
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,528
- Anyone doesn't agree?
- Fine, fine. Let's go.

600
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:47,696
Here, pass these along.

601
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:49,647
Is that the right time?

602
00:32:21,647 --> 00:32:47,553
"Guilty."

603
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:54,263
"Not guilty."

604
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:55,263
"Guilty."

605
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:57,517
Boy, how do you like that?

606
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,061
Oh, and another chap flaps his wings.

607
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,061
All right, who was it?
Come on. I want to know.

608
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:05,232
Excuse me. This was a secret ballot.

609
00:33:05,232 --> 00:33:06,232
We all agreed on that, no?

610
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,070
If the gentleman wanted
to remain secret...

611
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,030
Secret? What do you mean secret?

612
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:14,030
There are no secrets in a jury room.
I know who it was.

613
00:33:14,992 --> 00:33:16,992
Brother, you really are something.

614
00:33:16,994 --> 00:33:18,080
You sit here, vote guilty
like the rest of us...

615
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,080
and then some golden-voiced preacher
starts tearin' your poor heart out...

616
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:25,459
about some underprivileged kid
just couldn't help becomin' a murderer...

617
00:33:25,836 --> 00:33:27,422
and you change your vote.

618
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,422
If that isn't the most sick...

619
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:33,386
Why don't you drop a quarter
in his collection box?

620
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,386
Oh, now just wait a minute.

621
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,098
Listen, you can't talk to me like that.

622
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,017
- No. Who do you think you are?
- Calm down. Calm down.

623
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,017
No. Who does he think he is?
Did you hear him?

624
00:33:41,435 --> 00:33:44,435
- It doesn't matter. He's very excitable. Sit down.
- Excitable? You bet I'm excitable!

625
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,901
We're trying to put a guilty man
in the chair where he belongs!

626
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:50,654
Someone starts telling us fairy tales,
and we're listenin'!

627
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:52,489
Hey, uh, come on, huh?

628
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:54,489
What made you change your vote?

629
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,201
He didn't change his vote.

630
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:57,201
I did.

631
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,452
- Oh, fine.
- I knew it.

632
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:01,496
Would you like me to tell you why?

633
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,500
No, I wouldn't like you to tell me why.

634
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,127
I'd like to make it clear anyway,
if you don't mind.

635
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,127
Do we have to listen to this?

636
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,547
The man wants to talk.

637
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,215
Thank you.

638
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:14,215
This gentleman has been
standing alone against us.

639
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,635
Now, he doesn't say
the boy is not guilty.

640
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,014
He just isn't sure.

641
00:34:19,014 --> 00:34:21,014
Well, it's not easy to stand alone
against the ridicule of others.

642
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:25,146
So he gambled for support,
and I gave it to him.

643
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,146
I respect his motives.

644
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,570
The boy on trial is probably guilty,
but, uh, I want to hear more.

645
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,447
Right now, the vote is 10 to two.

646
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:35,447
I'm talking here!
You have no right to leave this room!

647
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,742
He can't hear you. He never will.

648
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,498
Let's sit down.

649
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,498
Shall we continue?

650
00:34:45,791 --> 00:34:48,085
Well, I - I think we ought
to take a break.

651
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:52,085
You know, one man's inside,
and I think we ought to wait for him.

652
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:55,298
Okay.

653
00:34:55,342 --> 00:34:57,342
Looks like we're really
hung up here, huh?

654
00:34:58,472 --> 00:35:00,472
And that thing with the old man,
that was pretty unexpected.

655
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:05,481
I wish I could figure out some way
we could break it up.

656
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:11,027
You know, in advertising -
I told you I worked in an agency.

657
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,027
Mm-hmm.

658
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,110
Well, there's some pretty strange people
working there.

659
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:17,197
Well, they're not strange really, I guess.

660
00:35:17,364 --> 00:35:19,076
It's just that they have peculiar ways
of expressing themselves.

661
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,076
You know what I mean.

662
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,371
Of course, I suppose it's the same
in your business too, huh?

663
00:35:24,371 --> 00:35:25,371
What do you do?

664
00:35:25,956 --> 00:35:28,210
- I'm a watchmaker.
- Oh, really?

665
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:31,210
Well, I imagine the finest watchmakers
in the world come from Europe, huh?

666
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:34,505
Anyway, as I was telling you, in an
agency, when we reach a point like this...

667
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:38,177
I'm telling him about, in an ad agency, when
a point like this is reached in a meeting...

668
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:40,177
there's always some character
ready with an idea, see.

669
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,889
And it kills me.

670
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,518
It's the weirdest thing in the world...

671
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:47,518
the way they sometimes precede their idea
with a little phrase, see, like...

672
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:50,938
Some account exec will get up,
and he'll say, uh...

673
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,858
"Okay, here's an idea.

674
00:35:52,858 --> 00:35:56,570
Let's, uh, run it up the flagpole
and see if anyone salutes it."

675
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:59,570
I mean, it's idiotic, but it's funny, huh?

676
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:04,288
I, uh
- I got a little excited back there. I...

677
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,288
didn't mean to get nasty.

678
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:11,878
I'm glad you're not one of those
lets these emotional appeals influence him.

679
00:36:12,878 --> 00:36:15,394
Uh...

680
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:31,394
I don't know what's the matter with that fan.
Can't seem to get it to start.

681
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:35,110
â™ª Be, be, be â™ª

682
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,110
â™ª Ba, ba, ba, ba, bum â™ªâ™ª

683
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:39,779
Eh!

684
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:43,117
Hey, you a salesman?

685
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:44,117
I'm an architect.

686
00:36:45,452 --> 00:36:46,452
Hmm.

687
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,043
You know what the soft sell is?

688
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,043
Boy, you got it. Believe me.

689
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,132
I got a different technique.

690
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:59,010
Laughs, drinks, jokes.

691
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,010
Tricks. You know?

692
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:04,096
Yeah.

693
00:37:05,764 --> 00:37:07,393
"Hit 'em where they live."
That's my motto.

694
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:12,393
I made 27 grand last year
sellin' marmalade.

695
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:15,695
That's not bad. I mean,
you know, considering marmalade.

696
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:20,657
Hey, what are you
gettin' outta this - kicks?

697
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,327
Or did somebody bump you on the head
one time and you haven't gotten over it?

698
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:27,038
Maybe.

699
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:30,038
You know, you do-gooders are all alike.

700
00:37:30,664 --> 00:37:33,420
You're always blowing your stacks
over some guy that fanned.

701
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,007
But what are you wasting our time for?

702
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:43,007
Why don't you donate five dollars to the
cause, and maybe it'll make you feel better.

703
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,347
This kid is guilty, pal.

704
00:37:48,682 --> 00:37:51,186
It's as plain as the nose on your face.

705
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:53,186
So why don't we stop
wasting our time here?

706
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,521
We're gonna all get sore throats
if we keep it up, you know?

707
00:37:56,523 --> 00:37:58,523
What difference does it make
if you get it here or at the ball game?

708
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,860
Oh, no difference, pal.

709
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:04,585
No difference at all.

710
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:18,545
Nice bunch of guys, huh?

711
00:38:18,545 --> 00:38:20,545
Oh, they're about the same
as anyone else.

712
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:23,719
Phew! Boy, what a murderous day.

713
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,719
You think we'll be much longer?

714
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,556
I don't know.

715
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,556
Aw, he's guilty for sure.

716
00:38:30,557 --> 00:38:32,184
Not a doubt in the whole world.

717
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:34,184
We should -
Should've been done already.

718
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,315
Oh, I don't mind, you know.

719
00:38:38,315 --> 00:38:40,315
Hmm. Beats workin'.

720
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,405
Uh...

721
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:50,119
You think he's not guilty, huh?

722
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,119
I don't know. It's possible.

723
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:56,583
Well, I don't know you, but I'm bettin'
you never been wronger in your life.

724
00:38:56,583 --> 00:38:59,086
You're wasting your time.
You ought to wrap it up.

725
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:01,086
Supposing you were the one
who was on trial.

726
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,050
Well, I'm not used to supposing.

727
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:08,050
I'm just a workingman.
My boss does the supposing. But...

728
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:10,349
Well, I'll try one.

729
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:17,349
Supposing you talk us all out of this, and,
uh, the kid really did knife his father. Huh?

730
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,322
Are you ready?

731
00:39:27,322 --> 00:39:28,322
Hup.

732
00:39:28,615 --> 00:39:29,615
That one.

733
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,202
Sorry, blue eyes.

734
00:39:32,202 --> 00:39:35,202
- Well, where else -
- Okay, fellas, let's take our seats.

735
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,706
Looks like we'll be here
for dinner, huh?

736
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,170
Okay, now let's -
Let's get down to business.

737
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,170
Now, who wants to start it off?

738
00:39:41,628 --> 00:39:43,130
- I would.
- Okay, go.

739
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,130
You down there.

740
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,262
The old man who lived downstairs says he
heard the kid yell out, "I'm gonna kill ya."

741
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:51,262
A second later,
he heard the body hit the floor.

742
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:55,934
Now, he ran to the door and he saw the kid
running down the stairs and out of the house.

743
00:39:55,934 --> 00:39:57,394
What does that mean to you?

744
00:39:57,394 --> 00:40:00,394
I was wondering how clearly the old man could
have heard the boy's voice through the ceiling.

745
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,856
He didn't hear it through the ceiling.
The window was open.

746
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:04,902
So was the one upstairs.
It was a hot night, remember?

747
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,320
Well, it was another apartment.

748
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,320
It's not that easy to identify a voice,
particularly a shouting voice.

749
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,657
- He identified it in court.
- That's right.

750
00:40:10,657 --> 00:40:12,202
And don't forget the lady
across the street.

751
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:14,079
She looked right in the open window
and saw the boy stab his father.

752
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,079
- Now, I mean, isn't that enough for you?
- No, it isn't.

753
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,623
Boy, how do you like this guy, huh?

754
00:40:19,666 --> 00:40:21,585
It's like talking into a dead phone.

755
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:24,585
She said she saw the killing through the
windows of a moving elevated train.

756
00:40:24,838 --> 00:40:28,425
There were six cars on the train.
She saw the killing through the last two cars.

757
00:40:28,425 --> 00:40:30,344
She remembered
the most insignificant details.

758
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,344
I don't see how you can argue with that.

759
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:37,472
Has anybody here any idea
how long it would take an el...

760
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,362
Hey!

761
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,159
This isn't a game.

762
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,159
- Did you see him?
- Hey.

763
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,329
- The nerve.
- All right, listen...

764
00:40:57,329 --> 00:41:00,329
- The absolute nerve.
- Forget it. It's not important.

765
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,666
- "This isn't a game"?
- Calm down.

766
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:06,130
- Who does he think he is?
- I'm telling you, forget it now.

767
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:09,130
Has anybody any idea how long
it takes an elevated train...

768
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,469
going at medium speed
to pass a given point?

769
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,429
- What has that to do with anything?
- How long? Take a guess.

770
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:16,181
- I wouldn't have the slightest idea.
- What do you think?

771
00:41:16,181 --> 00:41:18,059
I don't know. Maybe 10, 12 seconds?

772
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,059
I think that's a pretty good guess.
Anyone else?

773
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,690
- That sounds right to me.
- Come on. What's the guessing game for?

774
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,608
- What do you say?
- Ten seconds is about right.

775
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,608
All right. Say 10 seconds.
What are you getting at?

776
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:32,610
This. It takes a six-car el train
10 seconds to pass a given point.

777
00:41:32,739 --> 00:41:36,077
Now let's say the given point is the open window
of the room where the killing took place.

778
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:40,077
You can reach out of that window
and almost touch the el tracks, right?

779
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,041
Now let me ask you this.

780
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,041
Has anyone here
ever lived near the el tracks?

781
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:48,088
Well, uh, I just finished painting an
apartment that overlooked an el line.

782
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,088
- I was there for three days.
- What was it like?

783
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,092
- What do you mean?
- Noisy?

784
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:53,092
Oh, brother. Don't matter though.
We were all punchy.

785
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:56,389
I lived in a second-floor apartment
near the el line once.

786
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:59,389
When the window was open and the train
goes by, the noise is almost unbearable.

787
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:02,436
- You can hardly hear yourself think.
- All right, you can't hear yourself think.

788
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:04,436
- Will you get to the point?
- I will. Now just a minute.

789
00:42:04,938 --> 00:42:08,650
Let's take two pieces of testimony
and try to put them together.

790
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:12,650
First. The old man in the
apartment downstairs.

791
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:15,490
He says he heard the boy say
"I'm gonna kill you"...

792
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:18,327
and a split second later
heard a body hit the floor.

793
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,327
- One second later, right?
- That's right.

794
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:26,085
Second. The woman across the street swore
positively she looked out of the window...

795
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:29,085
and saw the killing through the last two
cars of the passing elevated train, right?

796
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,505
- The last two cars.
- What are you giving us here?

797
00:42:31,925 --> 00:42:33,342
Now, just a minute.

798
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:37,342
We've agreed that it takes 10 seconds
for a train to pass a given point.

799
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:41,018
Since the woman saw the killing
through the last two cars...

800
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:46,018
we can assume that the body
hit the floor just as the train went by.

801
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:51,065
Therefore, the train had been roaring
by the old man's window...

802
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:55,197
a full 10 seconds
before the body hit the floor.

803
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:57,197
The old man,
according to his own testimony...

804
00:42:57,492 --> 00:43:00,492
"I'm gonna kill you," body hitting
the floor a split second later...

805
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:02,039
would have had to hear the boy
make this statement...

806
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,039
with the el roaring past his nose.

807
00:43:04,998 --> 00:43:06,626
It's not possible he could've heard it.

808
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:08,626
- That's idiotic. Of course he heard it.
- Do you think he could've heard it?

809
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:11,338
He said he yelled at the top of his voice.
That's good enough for me.

810
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:13,338
Even if he heard something, he still
couldn't have identified the voice.

811
00:43:13,675 --> 00:43:14,675
With the el roaring by?

812
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:17,344
You're talking about a matter of seconds!
Nobody can be that accurate.

813
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:21,184
I think testimony that could put a boy into
the electric chair should be that accurate.

814
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:26,184
You know something?
I don't think he could've heard it.

815
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:28,186
Maybe he didn't hear it.
I mean, with all that el noise.

816
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,565
Oh, what are you people talking about?

817
00:43:30,565 --> 00:43:32,565
Well, it stands to reason
he couldn't have heard it.

818
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,693
Why should he lie?
What's he got to gain?

819
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,695
Attention maybe.

820
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,989
You keep coming in
with these bright sayings!

821
00:43:38,992 --> 00:43:42,119
Why don't you send 'em in to a paper?
They pay three dollars apiece.

822
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,119
What are you talking to him
like that for?

823
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:48,289
Guy talks like that to an old man
really ought to get stepped on, you know?

824
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,793
You ought to have more respect, mister.

825
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:56,184
If you say stuff like that to him again,
I'm gonna lay you out.

826
00:44:06,184 --> 00:44:09,184
Now you go ahead.
You - You say anything you like.

827
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:13,230
Why do you think
the old man might lie?

828
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:16,358
It was just that I looked at him
for a very long time.

829
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:20,405
The seams of his jacket was split,
under the shoulder.

830
00:44:20,742 --> 00:44:22,409
Or did you notice that?

831
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:24,409
I mean, to come to court like that.

832
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:26,789
Why...

833
00:44:27,789 --> 00:44:31,753
He was a very old man
in a torn jacket.

834
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:34,380
And he walked very slowly
to the stand.

835
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:39,380
He was dragging his left leg
and trying to hide it...

836
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,304
because he was ashamed.

837
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:45,304
I think I know this man
better than anyone here.

838
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:52,106
This is a quiet, frightened,
insignificant old man who...

839
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:54,106
who has been nothing all his life...

840
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:56,070
who has never had recognition...

841
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:59,070
or his name in the newspapers.

842
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:02,115
Nobody knows him.

843
00:45:02,115 --> 00:45:04,115
Nobody quotes him.

844
00:45:04,242 --> 00:45:08,039
Nobody seeks his advice after 75 years.

845
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:12,039
Gentlemen, that's a very sad thing -
to be nothing.

846
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:17,590
A man like this needs to be quoted,
to be listened to.

847
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,590
To be quoted just once.

848
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:22,012
Very important to him.

849
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:25,012
It would be so hard for him
to recede into the background...

850
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,307
- Wait a minute.
- When there was a chance...

851
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:30,268
What are you trying to do - tell us he'd
lie just so he could be important once?

852
00:45:30,268 --> 00:45:32,268
No. He wouldn't really lie.

853
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,525
But perhaps he made himself believe
he heard those words...

854
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,525
and recognized the boy's face.

855
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:41,197
That's the most fantastic story
I've ever heard.

856
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:44,197
How can you make up a thing like that?
What do you know about it?

857
00:45:53,291 --> 00:45:55,291
Oh, uh, does anybody
want a cough drop?

858
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,420
- No, thanks.
- I'll take one.

859
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:01,342
You can say what you like. I still don't
see how anybody can think he's not guilty.

860
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:03,342
There's something else
I'd like to talk about for a minute.

861
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,637
Thanks.

862
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:08,016
I think we've proved that the old man couldn't
have heard the boy say "I'm gonna kill you."

863
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,016
- But supposing -
- You didn't prove it at all.

864
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:13,563
- What are you talking about?
- Supposing he really did hear it.

865
00:46:13,563 --> 00:46:15,065
This phrase, how many times
have all of us used it?

866
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:17,065
Probably thousands.

867
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,360
"I could kill you for that, darling."

868
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,360
"Junior, you do that once more,
and I'm gonna kill you."

869
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:22,362
"Get in there, Rocky, and kill him."

870
00:46:22,737 --> 00:46:24,699
We say it every day. That doesn't mean
we're really gonna kill anybody.

871
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:26,576
Wait a minute.
What are you trying to give us here?

872
00:46:26,576 --> 00:46:30,371
The phrase was "I'm gonna kill you."
The kid yelled it at the top of his lungs.

873
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:31,371
Don't tell me he didn't mean it.

874
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,166
Anybody says a thing like that
the way he said it, they mean it.

875
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,166
Well, gee, now I don't know.

876
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:40,505
I remember I was arguing with a guy I work
next to at the bank a couple weeks ago.

877
00:46:40,505 --> 00:46:42,340
He called me an idiot, so I yelled at him.

878
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:45,340
Now listen! This guy's trying to make you
believe things that aren't so.

879
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:47,385
The kid said he was gonna kill him,
and he did kill him.

880
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:50,554
Let me ask you this. Do you really think the
boy would shout out a thing like that...

881
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:52,476
so the whole neighborhood could hear him?

882
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,394
I don't think so.
He's much too bright for that.

883
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:59,233
Bright? He's a common ignorant slob.
He don't even speak good English.

884
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:02,233
"He doesn't even speak good English."

885
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:08,409
Mr. Foreman, I'd like
to change my vote to not guilty.

886
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:09,409
You what?

887
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:12,246
- You heard me.
- Are you sure?

888
00:47:13,246 --> 00:47:14,246
Yeah, I'm sure.

889
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:17,293
The vote is nine to three,
favor of guilty.

890
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:20,132
Well, if this isn't the living end. Huh?

891
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:26,132
What are you basing it on -
the stories this guy made up?

892
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:29,512
You ought to write for one of those
kooky detective magazines.

893
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:31,849
You'd make a fortune.

894
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:35,769
For crying out loud. The kid's own lawyer
knew he didn't stand a chance.

895
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,438
Right from the beginning,
his own lawyer knew it.

896
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:39,315
You could see it.

897
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:42,315
Boy, oh, boy. I'm tellin' you,
this guy here is really something.

898
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:45,612
Look, the kid had a lawyer, didn't he?

899
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:48,532
He presented his case, not you.
How come you got so much to say?

900
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:51,452
- Look, lawyers aren't infallible, you know.
- Baltimore, please. Huh?

901
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:53,246
He was court-appointed.

902
00:47:53,246 --> 00:47:55,164
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It could mean a lot of things.

903
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:58,164
It could mean he didn't want the case,
or he resented being appointed.

904
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:00,418
It's the kind of case
that brings him nothing...

905
00:48:00,418 --> 00:48:03,418
no money, no glory,
not even much chance of winning.

906
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:06,463
That's not a very promising situation
for a young lawyer.

907
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:09,467
He'd really have to believe in his client
to put up any kind of a good case...

908
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:11,469
and, as you pointed out a minute ago,
obviously he didn't.

909
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:14,474
Of course he didn't. Huh.

910
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:16,474
Who the heck could?

911
00:48:16,851 --> 00:48:19,851
Except maybe
some guy's mother or somebody. I...

912
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,190
Ah, look.
Will you look at the time, huh?

913
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:24,190
- Come on. For crying out -
- Pardon me.

914
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:27,237
- I have made some notes here -
- Notes.

915
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:29,237
And I would like to -
please, to say something.

916
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:32,284
- Yeah.
- I have been listening very carefully.

917
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:36,284
And, uh, it seems to me that this man
has some very good points to make.

918
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:41,501
From what was presented at the trial,
the boy looks guilty on the surface.

919
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:45,501
- But maybe if we go deeper?
- Oh, come on, will ya?

920
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:47,050
There is a question I would like to ask.

921
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:51,050
Let us assume that the boy
really did commit the murder.

922
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:54,429
Now, this happened
at 10 minutes after 12:00.

923
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:57,393
Now, how was he caught by the police?

924
00:48:57,393 --> 00:49:01,393
He came back home, uh, at 3:00 or so...

925
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:05,818
and he was captured by two detectives
in the hallway of his house.

926
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:10,489
Now, my question is,
if he really had killed his father...

927
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:13,489
why would he come back home
three hours later?

928
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,746
Wouldn't he be afraid of being caught?

929
00:49:16,746 --> 00:49:18,581
He came home to get his knife.

930
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:21,208
It's not nice to go around leaving knives
sticking in people's chests.

931
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,045
- Yeah, especially relatives.
- Yeah.

932
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:26,045
I don't see anything funny about it.

933
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,009
The boy knew the knife could be identified
as the one he had just bought.

934
00:49:30,009 --> 00:49:32,009
He had to get it before the police did.

935
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:36,260
But if he knew the knife could be identified,
why did he leave it there in the first place?

936
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:40,226
Well, I think we can assume
the boy ran out in a state of panic...

937
00:49:40,226 --> 00:49:42,226
after having just killed his father.

938
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:45,688
When he finally calmed down,
he realized he had left his knife there.

939
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:48,733
Ah. This then depends
on your definition of panic.

940
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:51,197
He would have had to be
calm enough to see to it...

941
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:53,197
that there were no fingerprints
left on the knife.

942
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:57,865
Now, where did this panic start
and where did it end?

943
00:49:57,994 --> 00:50:00,456
Look, you voted guilty.
What side are ya on?

944
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:04,085
I don't believe I have to be loyal
to one side or the other.

945
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:05,085
I'm simply asking questions.

946
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,047
Well, this is just off the top of my head,
but, uh...

947
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:11,047
well, if I were the boy
and I'd done the stabbing and everything...

948
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:13,634
I'd take a chance
and go back for the knife.

949
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,429
I'll bet he figured that nobody
had seen him running out...

950
00:50:16,429 --> 00:50:18,016
and that the body wouldn't be discovered
till the next day.

951
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,016
Well, after all,
it was the middle of the night.

952
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:23,143
I'll bet he'd figured nobody
would find the body till the next day.

953
00:50:23,728 --> 00:50:25,728
Pardon. This is my whole point.

954
00:50:25,815 --> 00:50:29,610
The woman across the street testified that
the moment after she saw the killing...

955
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:32,279
that is, a moment
after the train went by...

956
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:35,279
she screamed
and then went to telephone the police.

957
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:38,365
Now, the boy certainly
must have heard the scream...

958
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:42,414
so he knew
that somebody saw something.

959
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:45,291
I just don't think
that he would have gone back.

960
00:50:45,291 --> 00:50:48,128
Two things. One, in his state of panic,
he may not have heard the scream.

961
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:49,128
Perhaps it wasn't very loud.

962
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,342
Two, if he did hear it, he may not
have connected it with his own act.

963
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:56,342
Remember, he lived in a neighborhood
where screams were fairly commonplace.

964
00:50:56,469 --> 00:50:58,014
- There's your answer.
- Maybe.

965
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,014
Maybe the boy did kill his father,
didn't hear the scream...

966
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:05,771
did run out in a panic,
did calm down three hours later...

967
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,481
and come back to get the knife,
risking being caught by the police.

968
00:51:08,481 --> 00:51:11,481
Maybe all of those things happened,
but maybe they didn't.

969
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:14,320
I think there's enough doubt that we can
wonder whether he was there at all...

970
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,072
during the time the killing took place.

971
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:17,072
What do you mean doubt?
What are you talking about?

972
00:51:17,907 --> 00:51:19,702
Didn't the old man see him
running out of the house?

973
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:21,579
He's twisting the facts, I'm telling you.

974
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:24,579
Did or didn't the old man see the kid
running out of the house at 12:10?

975
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:26,001
Well, did or didn't he?

976
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:30,001
- He says he did.
- "Says he did"? Boy! How do you like that?

977
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:33,295
- Now, look, witnesses can make mistakes.
- Sure, when you want them to, they do.

978
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,340
Or when he wants them to, they do.
You know what I mean?

979
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:37,594
- Keep the yelling down!
- Oh, you keep saying that.

980
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:39,387
Maybe what we need
is a little yelling in here.

981
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:41,181
These guys
keep going off every which way.

982
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,181
Did hear the scream.
Didn't hear the scream.

983
00:51:43,184 --> 00:51:46,184
What difference does it make? You people
are talking only about the little details.

984
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:48,023
You're forgetting the important stuff.
I mean, all of a sudden, everybody here...

985
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:51,023
- I want to call for another vote.
- I'm talking here!

986
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:55,032
There's another vote called for.
Now let's take our seats.

987
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:01,032
I never saw so much time
spent on nothing.

988
00:52:01,659 --> 00:52:03,454
It only takes a second.

989
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:07,454
Okay. I guess the fastest way
is to find out who's voting not guilty.

990
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,958
Now, all those voting not guilty,
please raise your hands.

991
00:52:11,961 --> 00:52:15,632
Still the same.
One, two, three not guilty. Nine guilty.

992
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,384
So, now where are we?

993
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:20,384
I'm telling you, we can yackety-yack until
next Tuesday. Where's it all getting us?

994
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:23,724
Pardon. I vote not guilty.

995
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:26,724
Oh!

996
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:30,188
What are ya talking about? I mean,
we're all going crazy in here or something.

997
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:33,068
The kid is guilty.
Why don't you listen to the facts?

998
00:52:34,068 --> 00:52:36,068
Tell him, will ya?
Now this is getting to be a joke.

999
00:52:36,402 --> 00:52:39,402
The vote is eight to four,
favor of guilty.

1000
00:52:39,697 --> 00:52:43,452
What is this, love your underprivileged
brother week or something?

1001
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:45,038
I want you to get up and tell me
why you changed your vote.

1002
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:50,038
- Come on. Give me your reasons.
- I don't have to defend my decision to you.

1003
00:52:50,416 --> 00:52:52,253
There is a reasonable doubt in my mind.

1004
00:52:52,253 --> 00:52:55,253
What reasonable doubt? That's nothing but words.
Here, look at this.

1005
00:52:55,338 --> 00:53:00,338
The kid you just decided isn't guilty
was seen ramming this into his father.

1006
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:02,344
Now, what about this,
Mr. Reasonable Doubt?

1007
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,181
That's not the knife.
Don't you remember?

1008
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:07,181
Oh, brilliant.

1009
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,434
I'm telling ya, this is the craziest.

1010
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:11,063
I mean, what are we supposed to believe?

1011
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:14,063
I mean, you're sittin' here, you're pulling
stories out of thin air, you know?

1012
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:18,779
A guy like this, if he's, uh, sitting
ringside at the Dempsey-Firpo fight...

1013
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:21,322
he'd be trying to tell you that, uh...

1014
00:53:21,322 --> 00:53:23,322
Look. Now, what about the old man?

1015
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:26,452
Are we supposed to believe that he
didn't get up and run to his door...

1016
00:53:26,452 --> 00:53:29,452
and see the kid tearing down the steps
15 seconds after the killing?

1017
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:32,083
He's just saying so to be important, right?

1018
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:34,083
- I mean, what's the point of the whole thing?
- Wait. Hold it a second, will you?

1019
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:37,255
Oh, and the Baltimore rooter
is heard from again now...

1020
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:39,255
and pop-ups are fallin' for base hits
wherever we look.

1021
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,300
Hold it a second. Now, look -
Did the old man say he ran to the door?

1022
00:53:42,635 --> 00:53:45,635
Ran, walked. What's the difference? He got on, didn't he?
I mean, he got there, didn't he?

1023
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:48,309
- No, now wait a second.
- He said he ran. At least I think he did.

1024
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:51,309
Look, I don't remember what he said, but I
don't see how he could have run to the door.

1025
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:54,273
Î—e said he went
from his bedroom to the front door.

1026
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:55,273
- Now, isn't that enough?
- Where was the bedroom?

1027
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:58,318
- It was down the hall somewhere.
- I thought you remembered everything.

1028
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:00,318
- Don't you remember that?
- No.

1029
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,654
Mr. Foreman, I'd like to see
a diagram of the apartment.

1030
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:06,284
- Why don't we just have 'em run the trial all over again
so you can get everything straight? - Mr. Foreman.

1031
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:08,284
How come you're the only one in this room
wants to see exhibits all the time?

1032
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:11,789
- I want to see this one too.
- And I'd like to stop wasting time.

1033
00:54:11,789 --> 00:54:14,710
If we're gonna start wading through all that
nonsense about where the body was found...

1034
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:16,710
We're not,
not unless somebody else wants to.

1035
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:18,547
But I'd like to find out if an old man...

1036
00:54:18,547 --> 00:54:20,007
who drags one foot when he walks
'cause he had a stroke last year...

1037
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:23,007
can get from his bedroom
to his front door in 15 seconds.

1038
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,262
- He said 20 seconds.
- Î—e said 15.

1039
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:27,262
He said 20 seconds.
What are you trying to distort...

1040
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:30,514
- He said 15.
- How does he know how long 15 seconds is?

1041
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:32,603
You can't judge a thing like that.

1042
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:34,063
- He said 15 seconds.
- He was very positive about it.

1043
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:37,063
He was an old man.
Half the time he was confused.

1044
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:39,326
How could he be positive about anything?

1045
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:51,326
I don't see what you're going to prove here.
The man said he saw the boy running out.

1046
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:53,538
Well, let's see
if the details bear him out.

1047
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,751
As soon as the body hit the floor,
he said he heard footsteps upstairs...

1048
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:58,503
running toward the front door...

1049
00:54:58,503 --> 00:55:01,503
heard the upstairs door open,
the footsteps start down the stairs.

1050
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:03,673
He said he got to his own front door
as fast as he could...

1051
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:05,052
and he swore it couldn't have been
more than 15 seconds.

1052
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:07,052
Now, if the killer
began running immediately...

1053
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:10,099
- Maybe he didn't.
- The old man said he did.

1054
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:12,099
You ought to be at Atlantic City
at that hairsplitters convention.

1055
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:16,103
Hey, why don't you stop makin'
smart remarks all the time, huh?

1056
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:19,313
My friend, for your three dollars a day,
you have to listen to everything, you know?

1057
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:21,318
Now that you've got that thing in here,
what about it?

1058
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,318
All right. Here's the apartment
where the killing took place.

1059
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:26,570
The old man's apartment
was directly beneath and exactly the same.

1060
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:29,699
Here are the el tracks, the bedroom,
living room, kitchen, bathroom.

1061
00:55:29,994 --> 00:55:31,079
Here's the hall. Here are the stairs.

1062
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,079
Now, the old man
was in this bedroom right here.

1063
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:37,166
He says he crossed to the door
and walked down the hall...

1064
00:55:37,166 --> 00:55:40,166
opened the front door just in time
to see the boy running down the stairs.

1065
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:43,211
- Am I right so far?
- That's the story, for the 19th time.

1066
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:47,260
- Fifteen seconds after the body hit the floor.
- Correct.

1067
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,260
Now, let's see. It was...

1068
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:53,387
It's 12 feet from the bed to the door.
The hall is 43 feet.

1069
00:55:53,474 --> 00:55:56,474
He would have had to walk 12 feet,
open the bedroom door...

1070
00:55:56,769 --> 00:56:00,481
walk 43 feet down and open the front door
all in 15 seconds.

1071
00:56:00,481 --> 00:56:03,277
- Do you think he could have done it?
- Sure he could have done it.

1072
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:05,277
He can walk only very slowly.
They had to help him into the witness chair.

1073
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:07,697
You make it sound like a long walk.

1074
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:10,117
For an old man who had a stroke,
it is a long walk.

1075
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:13,117
- Oh! What are you doing?
- I'm gonna try it, see how long it took him.

1076
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:16,123
What do you mean, you want to try it?
Why didn't his lawyer bring it up if it's so important?

1077
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:20,123
- Maybe he just didn't think about it, huh?
- What do you mean, didn't think of it? You think the man's an idiot or something?

1078
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:22,463
- It's an obvious thing.
- Did you think of it?

1079
00:56:22,463 --> 00:56:24,213
Listen, smart guy.
Don't matter whether I thought of it.

1080
00:56:24,213 --> 00:56:26,213
He didn't bring it up because he knew it would
hurt his case. What do you think of that?

1081
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:30,471
Maybe he didn't bring it up because it would have
meant bullying and badgering a helpless old man.

1082
00:56:30,471 --> 00:56:33,471
You know that doesn't sit very well with a jury.
Most lawyers avoid it if they can.

1083
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:36,684
- So, what kind of a bum is he then?
- That's what I've been asking, buddy.

1084
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:39,684
Pass me that chair, will you?
Those two chairs are the old man's bed.

1085
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:42,775
I just paced off 12 feet across the room.
This will be the bedroom door.

1086
00:56:42,775 --> 00:56:45,485
Oh, that's crazy.
You can't recreate a thing like that.

1087
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:47,485
- I'd like to see it.
- The hall was 43 feet.

1088
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,074
I'll pace from that wall and back again.

1089
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:54,074
Look, this is absolutely insane.
What are you wasting everybody's time in here for?

1090
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:57,835
According to you, it'll only take 15 seconds.
Now, we can spare that, see.

1091
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:03,586
Come on. Knock it off.

1092
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:05,172
Okay.

1093
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:07,172
Okay. Okay, killer.

1094
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:08,219
Yeah.

1095
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:13,219
Will you stand right there
and mark the front door?

1096
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:15,347
It was chain-locked according
to the testimony, remember?

1097
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:18,184
- Has anybody got a watch with a second hand?
- I have.

1098
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:20,184
When you want me to start, stamp your foot.
That'll be the body falling.

1099
00:57:20,686 --> 00:57:22,686
You can time me from there.

1100
00:57:22,688 --> 00:57:24,688
What are we gonna do, play charades now?

1101
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,858
- Come on! What are we waiting for?
- Okay, I'm ready.

1102
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:28,985
Well, I want to wait
till the second hand reaches 60.

1103
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,621
Oh, come on.

1104
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:40,083
Come on. Speed it up.
He could walk twice as fast as that.

1105
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:44,083
You want me to walk faster than that,
I will.

1106
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:03,436
Lock. Door. Stop.

1107
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:05,065
- Right.
- What's the time?

1108
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:09,065
Uh, exactly 41 seconds.

1109
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:11,402
This is what I think happened.

1110
00:58:11,737 --> 00:58:14,657
The old man heard the fight between the boy
and his father a few hours earlier.

1111
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:17,577
Then when he's lying in bed, he heard the
body hit the floor in the boy's apartment...

1112
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:21,164
heard the woman scream from across the street,
got to his front door as fast as he could...

1113
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:23,164
heard somebody racing down the stairs
and assumed it was the boy.

1114
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,751
- I think that's possible.
- Assumed?

1115
00:58:25,751 --> 00:58:28,338
Oh.

1116
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:34,338
Brother, I've seen all kinds of dishonesty in
my day, but this little display takes the cake.

1117
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:39,182
You all come in here with your hearts bleeding all
over the floor about slum kids and injustice.

1118
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,182
You listen to some fairy tales.

1119
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:43,268
Suddenly you start getting through
to some of these old ladies.

1120
00:58:43,644 --> 00:58:46,644
Well, you're not getting through to me.
I've had enough.

1121
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,690
What's the matter with you guys?

1122
00:58:48,817 --> 00:58:51,612
You all know he's guilty!
He's got to burn!

1123
00:58:51,612 --> 00:58:53,487
You're letting him slip
through our fingers.

1124
00:58:53,487 --> 00:58:55,487
"Slip through our fingers"?
Are you his executioner?

1125
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,619
I'm one of 'em!

1126
00:58:58,619 --> 00:59:00,536
Perhaps you'd like to pull the switch.

1127
00:59:00,536 --> 00:59:02,536
For this kid, you bet I would.

1128
00:59:02,623 --> 00:59:05,623
I feel sorry for you. What it must
feel like to want to pull the switch.

1129
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:10,751
Ever since you walked into this room, you've been
acting like a self-appointed public avenger.

1130
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:15,135
You want to see this boy die because you
personally want it, not because of the facts.

1131
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:17,135
- You're a sadist.
- You...

1132
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:21,307
Let me go!
I'll kill him. I'll kill him!

1133
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:23,025
You don't really mean
you'll kill me, do you?

1134
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:33,025
Is there anything wrong, gentlemen?
I heard some noise.

1135
00:59:33,445 --> 00:59:37,445
Oh, no. Everything's all right. We're just
- You know, friendly little argument. It's...

1136
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:40,204
Um, listen, we're through with that diagram.
You can take it if you want.

1137
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:43,204
Here you are. Thank you.

1138
00:59:49,418 --> 00:59:51,275
What are you lookin' at?

1139
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:14,275
I suppose somebody
has to start it off again.

1140
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:18,197
- I beg pardon.
- "I beg pardon." What are you so polite about?

1141
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:20,197
For the same reason you're not.

1142
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:22,288
It's the way I was brought up.

1143
01:00:24,288 --> 01:00:26,288
This fighting...

1144
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,289
That's not why we are here, to fight.

1145
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:30,416
We have a responsibility.

1146
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:36,632
This, I have always thought,
is a remarkable thing about democracy...

1147
01:00:36,632 --> 01:00:38,632
that we are...

1148
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:42,389
Uh, what is the word?

1149
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:45,389
Notified.
That we are notified by mail...

1150
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:49,559
to come down to this place
to decide on the guilt or innocence...

1151
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:54,108
of a man we have never heard of before.

1152
01:00:54,108 --> 01:00:58,108
We have nothing to gain or lose
by - by our verdict.

1153
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:02,572
This is one of the reasons
why we are strong.

1154
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:06,164
We should not make it a personal thing.

1155
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:09,043
Thank you.

1156
01:01:11,043 --> 01:01:13,043
If nobody else has an idea,
I may have a cutie here.

1157
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:16,255
I mean, I haven't given it much thought,
but let's throw it out on the stoop...

1158
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:17,255
and see if the cat licks it up.

1159
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:20,806
- The cat licks it up?
- Yeah. If the boy...

1160
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:26,016
Look how dark it's getting out there.

1161
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:29,016
I'll bet we're gonna have a storm now.

1162
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:33,233
Boy, oh, boy. It's really hot, huh?

1163
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:38,233
Pardon me, but don't you ever sweat?

1164
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:41,445
No, I don't.

1165
01:01:41,697 --> 01:01:43,697
Well, listen. I, uh...

1166
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:46,036
I was wondering if, uh, maybe...

1167
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:49,036
maybe we should take another vote.

1168
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:53,414
Oh, great. Maybe we can follow this one up
with a little dancing and refreshments, huh?

1169
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:55,380
- Hmm.
- Mr. Foreman?

1170
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:59,007
Well, that's okay with me.
Anyone doesn't want to vote?

1171
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:03,007
- Hey, come on. Come on.
- I'm sorry.

1172
01:02:03,302 --> 01:02:06,302
I think we ought to have an open ballot -
call out our votes, you know.

1173
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:09,184
Let's see who stands where.

1174
01:02:09,184 --> 01:02:11,184
That sounds fair to me.
Anyone object?

1175
01:02:14,438 --> 01:02:17,150
Okay. I'll call off your jury numbers.
One.

1176
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:20,028
Oh, that's me. I vote guilty.

1177
01:02:21,028 --> 01:02:22,028
Two?

1178
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,905
Not guilty.

1179
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:27,786
- Number three?
- Guilty.

1180
01:02:28,786 --> 01:02:30,786
Number four?

1181
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:33,708
Guilty.

1182
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:36,545
- Number five?
- Not guilty.

1183
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:40,545
- Number six?
- Not guilty.

1184
01:02:41,842 --> 01:02:43,592
Number seven?

1185
01:02:43,592 --> 01:02:45,387
Guilty.

1186
01:02:45,387 --> 01:02:47,387
Number eight?

1187
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:49,514
Not guilty.

1188
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:53,516
- Number nine?
- Not guilty.

1189
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:55,481
- Number 10?
- Guilty.

1190
01:02:57,481 --> 01:02:59,481
Number 11?

1191
01:02:59,608 --> 01:03:01,527
Not guilty.

1192
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:03,527
Number 12?

1193
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:06,365
Number 12.

1194
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:07,365
Guilty.

1195
01:03:13,789 --> 01:03:15,789
The vote is now six to six.

1196
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:19,547
Yeah, right.
And we go into extra innings here, huh?

1197
01:03:21,547 --> 01:03:26,135
Six to six. I'm telling you, some of you
people in here must be out of your minds.

1198
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:27,054
A kid like that.

1199
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:31,054
I don't think the kind of boy he is
has anything to do with it.

1200
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:33,391
The facts are supposed
to determine the case.

1201
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:35,559
Don't give me that!
I'm sick and tired of facts!

1202
01:03:35,811 --> 01:03:37,811
You can twist them any way you like.
You know what I mean?

1203
01:03:37,898 --> 01:03:40,567
That's exactly the point
this gentleman has been making.

1204
01:03:40,567 --> 01:03:43,155
- Oh!
- I mean, you keep shouting at the top of your lungs.

1205
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:47,155
I'd like to be a few years younger.

1206
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:49,157
That man gets on my...

1207
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:55,373
- My, it's hot in here, isn't it?
- Do you want a drink of water?

1208
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:59,373
No. No, thanks. Thanks.

1209
01:04:06,927 --> 01:04:08,802
It's gonna rain.

1210
01:04:08,802 --> 01:04:11,306
Well, how'd you figure that out, killer?

1211
01:04:12,306 --> 01:04:14,266
How come you changed your vote?

1212
01:04:14,266 --> 01:04:16,266
Well, it just seemed to me
there was room for doubt.

1213
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:18,063
You haven't got a leg to stand on.
You know that, I hope.

1214
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:22,063
I don't feel that way.
There were a lot of details that never came out.

1215
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:25,150
- Yeah. Well, good luck.
- Oh, come on. You're like everybody else.

1216
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:27,240
You think too much.
You get mixed up.

1217
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:33,240
- You know what I mean?
- Now, listen. I don't think you have any right...

1218
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:35,286
Loudmouth.

1219
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:31,262
Look at that come down, will you?

1220
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:34,222
You know...

1221
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:36,222
this reminds me of a storm we had last...

1222
01:05:36,807 --> 01:05:40,353
Oh, when was that? November...

1223
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:43,353
I don't know. Something.
It was quite a storm we had there.

1224
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:45,523
It was right in the middle of a game.

1225
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:48,695
Uh, we were behind 7-6...

1226
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:51,364
but we just started to move the ball,
right off the tackle.

1227
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:54,242
Started cutting right -
slash here and slash right in...

1228
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:56,119
cut right through.

1229
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:58,119
And, uh...

1230
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:00,083
We had this kid Slattery, you know?

1231
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:05,083
A real - He was an ox.
You know, a real ox.

1232
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:08,130
I wish I had another one just like him.

1233
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:12,130
I forgot to tell you. I'm the assistant head
coach at the Andrew J. McCorkle High School.

1234
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:14,719
- Oh, yeah?
- That's out in Queens.

1235
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:17,724
And, uh, anyway...

1236
01:06:17,724 --> 01:06:19,724
we're starting to move along real nice.

1237
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:23,356
Their whole line is just -
they're just coming apart.

1238
01:06:24,356 --> 01:06:28,193
And it starts to come down
cats and dogs, just like this.

1239
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:30,112
Just whoosh - you know, right down.

1240
01:06:32,112 --> 01:06:35,112
Well, that was murder, you know?

1241
01:06:35,574 --> 01:06:38,244
I swear, I - I nearly bawled.

1242
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:40,244
You just - You couldn't go nowhere.

1243
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,806
Well.

1244
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:01,067
Hey, what is it with this fan here?
How come...

1245
01:07:09,067 --> 01:07:10,067
Hey! Î—uh?

1246
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:14,197
Must have been
on the same switch with the lights.

1247
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:18,034
Well, things are looking up here, huh?

1248
01:07:19,034 --> 01:07:20,034
Yeah, huh?

1249
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:27,050
Boy. That's better.

1250
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,050
Hey!

1251
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:37,306
Two points.

1252
01:07:41,306 --> 01:07:43,306
Any of you guys ever go to the Garden?

1253
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:48,565
That's a damn stupid thing to do.

1254
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:50,565
Oh, I'm sorry. I, uh...

1255
01:07:51,775 --> 01:07:53,775
You know?

1256
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:56,449
Pardon me.

1257
01:07:57,449 --> 01:07:59,449
Well, how do you like it?
Even Steven.

1258
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:02,327
Pretty surprising, isn't it?

1259
01:08:02,327 --> 01:08:03,327
Yes.

1260
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:09,210
Say, that business before,
when that tall guy - what's-his-name...

1261
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:11,005
was trying to bait me -
That doesn't prove anything.

1262
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:14,005
I'm a pretty excitable person.

1263
01:08:14,673 --> 01:08:18,595
I mean, where does he come off calling me
a public avenger, sadist and everything?

1264
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:22,181
Anyone in his right mind
would blow his stack, huh?

1265
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:24,181
He was just trying to bait me.

1266
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:26,354
He did an excellent job.

1267
01:08:29,354 --> 01:08:31,354
I'll tell you what I think.
We're going nowhere here.

1268
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:34,277
I'm ready to walk into court right now
and declare a hung jury.

1269
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:36,195
There's no point in this thing
going on any more.

1270
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:37,195
Yeah. I go for that too.

1271
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:40,533
Listen, let's take it in to the judge and let
the kid take his chances with 12 other guys.

1272
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:43,453
I don't think the judge will accept a hung jury.
We haven't been in here very long.

1273
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:45,204
Well, let's find out.

1274
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:46,204
I'm not in favor of that.

1275
01:08:46,997 --> 01:08:50,292
Listen. This kid wouldn't stand a chance
with another jury, and you know it.

1276
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:53,212
Come on! We're hung. Nobody's gonna
change his vote. Let's take it inside.

1277
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:55,212
You still don't think there's room
for reasonable doubt?

1278
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:56,506
No, I don't.

1279
01:08:56,882 --> 01:08:58,259
Pardon.

1280
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:01,259
Maybe you don't fully understand
the term "reasonable doubt."

1281
01:09:01,595 --> 01:09:04,225
What do you mean I don't understand?

1282
01:09:05,225 --> 01:09:07,225
Boy, how do ya like this guy?

1283
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:08,020
I'm tellin' ya, they're all alike.

1284
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:11,020
They come over here, running for their life,
and before they can take a deep breath...

1285
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:14,399
they're telling us how
to run the show, huh?

1286
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:16,277
Boy, the arrogance of this guy.

1287
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:20,277
Hey, all right. Let's stop
the arguing for about two minutes in here.

1288
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:23,408
Now, who's got something
constructive to say?

1289
01:09:23,408 --> 01:09:26,037
I'd like to go over something,
if you gentlemen don't mind.

1290
01:09:27,037 --> 01:09:29,037
An important point for the prosecution
was the fact...

1291
01:09:29,791 --> 01:09:32,627
that after the boy claimed
he'd been at the movies...

1292
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:34,627
during the hours
that the killing took place...

1293
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:38,675
couldn't remember the names of the movies
or the stars who appeared in them.

1294
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:41,261
This gentleman here has put up that point
in here several times.

1295
01:09:41,261 --> 01:09:42,261
That's correct.

1296
01:09:42,804 --> 01:09:44,764
It was the only alibi the boy offered...

1297
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:47,350
and he himself couldn't back it up
with any details at all.

1298
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:50,350
Putting yourself in the boy's place,
do you think you could remember details...

1299
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:54,231
after an upsetting experience such as
being slapped in the face by your father?

1300
01:09:54,231 --> 01:09:57,231
I think so, if there were
any special details to remember.

1301
01:09:57,527 --> 01:10:00,527
The boy couldn't remember the names of the movies
he saw because be wasn't there that night.

1302
01:10:00,779 --> 01:10:02,779
According to
the police testimony in court...

1303
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:06,118
the boy was questioned by the detectives
in the kitchen of his apartment...

1304
01:10:06,118 --> 01:10:09,118
while the body of his father
was lying on the floor in the bedroom.

1305
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:11,122
Do you think you could remember details
under those circumstances?

1306
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:13,791
- I do.
- Under great emotional stress?

1307
01:10:13,877 --> 01:10:16,462
- Under great emotional stress.
- He remembered them correctly in court.

1308
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:18,462
He named the pictures
and the stars who played in them.

1309
01:10:18,506 --> 01:10:21,506
Yes. His lawyer took great pains
to bring that out.

1310
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:24,386
He had three months from the night
of the murder to the day of the trial...

1311
01:10:24,386 --> 01:10:26,096
in which to memorize them.

1312
01:10:26,096 --> 01:10:28,096
It's not difficult for a lawyer to find out
what played at a particular theater...

1313
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:30,601
on a particular night.

1314
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:34,314
I'll take the testimony of the policemen who
interrogated the boy right after the murder...

1315
01:10:34,314 --> 01:10:36,314
when he couldn't remember
a thing about the movies...

1316
01:10:36,815 --> 01:10:38,815
great emotional stress or not.

1317
01:10:38,818 --> 01:10:42,195
- I'd like to ask you a personal question.
- Go ahead.

1318
01:10:42,195 --> 01:10:45,195
- Where were you last night?
- I was home.

1319
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:48,161
- How about the night before that?
- Come on! What is this?

1320
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:49,161
No, it's all right.

1321
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:52,206
I left the office at 8:30
and went straight home and to bed.

1322
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:53,206
And the night before that?

1323
01:10:53,957 --> 01:10:56,461
That was, uh, Tuesday night?

1324
01:10:56,461 --> 01:10:58,461
The night of the bridge tournament.
I played bridge.

1325
01:10:58,546 --> 01:10:59,546
Monday night?

1326
01:10:59,963 --> 01:11:03,177
When you get down
to New Year's Eve, 1954, let me know, huh?

1327
01:11:05,177 --> 01:11:07,177
Monday night?

1328
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:11,389
Monday night, uh,
my wife and I went to the movies.

1329
01:11:11,475 --> 01:11:13,185
- What did you see?
- The Scarlet Circle.

1330
01:11:13,185 --> 01:11:16,185
- It was a clever whodunit.
- What was the second feature?

1331
01:11:16,521 --> 01:11:19,233
The, um...

1332
01:11:19,233 --> 01:11:21,233
I'll tell you in a minute. The, uh...

1333
01:11:21,985 --> 01:11:26,239
Remarkable Mrs., uh, something...

1334
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:28,239
The...

1335
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:31,537
Mrs. Bainbridge.
The Remarkable Mrs. Bainbridge.

1336
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:34,537
I saw that.
It's called The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge.

1337
01:11:35,582 --> 01:11:37,043
Uh, yes. The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge.
I think that's right.

1338
01:11:38,043 --> 01:11:40,043
Who was in The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge?

1339
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:44,384
Barbara... Long, I think it was.

1340
01:11:44,384 --> 01:11:46,384
A dark, very pretty girl.

1341
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,305
Ling or Long - something like that.

1342
01:11:50,305 --> 01:11:53,305
- Who else?
- I'd never heard of them before.

1343
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:58,105
It was a very inexpensive second feature
with, uh, unknown...

1344
01:11:58,105 --> 01:12:01,105
And you weren't under
an emotional stress, were you?

1345
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:06,153
No.

1346
01:12:06,363 --> 01:12:08,363
I wasn't.

1347
01:12:09,908 --> 01:12:11,743
I think the point is made.

1348
01:12:11,743 --> 01:12:14,579
Big point!

1349
01:12:14,579 --> 01:12:16,579
You can talk till your tongue
is draggin' on the floor.

1350
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:20,003
The boy is guilty, period.
You know what I mean, my friend?

1351
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:24,003
- Who's got those cough drops?
- They're all gone, my friend.

1352
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:28,259
Oh, boy. Look at that rain.

1353
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:30,055
There goes your ball game.

1354
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:33,055
It's only a shower.

1355
01:12:33,557 --> 01:12:35,557
Besides, they got the infield covered.

1356
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:38,774
Right. Say, could I see that knife
a second, please?

1357
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:44,193
Well, we're still tied up six to six.

1358
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:46,193
Who's got a suggestion?

1359
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:48,279
It's five after 6:00.
Let's get some dinner.

1360
01:12:48,363 --> 01:12:50,363
Why don't we wait till 7:00,
give it another hour, huh?

1361
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:53,118
Okay with me.

1362
01:12:53,118 --> 01:12:55,118
Uh, there's something I'd like to say.

1363
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:58,000
I mean, it's been bothering me a little,
and as long as we're stuck.

1364
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Well, there was this whole business
about the stab wound and how it was made...

1365
01:13:02,962 --> 01:13:04,671
the downward angle of it, you know?

1366
01:13:04,671 --> 01:13:06,671
Don't tell me we're gonna
start with that again.

1367
01:13:06,757 --> 01:13:08,467
They've been over it and over it.

1368
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:10,467
Well, I know they did,
but I don't go along with it.

1369
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:14,845
Now, the boy was 5 feet 7 inches tall.
His father was 6'2...

1370
01:13:14,931 --> 01:13:17,185
That's a difference of seven inches.

1371
01:13:17,185 --> 01:13:19,185
It's a very awkward thing to stab down
into the chest of someone...

1372
01:13:19,936 --> 01:13:21,023
who's more than half a foot
taller than you are.

1373
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:24,023
Give me that.

1374
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:27,233
I'll give you a demonstration.
Somebody get up.

1375
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,404
You...

1376
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:37,622
I want you to watch this 'cause
I don't want to have to do it again.

1377
01:13:37,622 --> 01:13:40,457
I'll make myself about six
or seven inches shorter, okay?

1378
01:13:40,457 --> 01:13:43,385
- It's about right. Maybe a little more.
- Okay. A little more.

1379
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:53,385
That's not funny.

1380
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:59,394
Now, nobody's hurt. Right?

1381
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:02,394
Right. Nobody hurt.

1382
01:14:05,649 --> 01:14:10,529
Now, this is the way I'd stab a man
who was taller than I was.

1383
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:12,073
Look at the angle - down and in.

1384
01:14:13,073 --> 01:14:15,073
And this is the way it was done.

1385
01:14:15,243 --> 01:14:17,243
Now tell me I'm wrong.

1386
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:23,126
- Down and in. I guess there's no argument.
- Hold it a minute, will ya?

1387
01:14:23,126 --> 01:14:24,126
Can you give me that?

1388
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:27,962
Boy, I hate these things.

1389
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:29,715
- Did you ever see a knife fight?
- No.

1390
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:31,384
- You?
- No.

1391
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:34,261
Anybody here ever see a knife fight?

1392
01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:37,140
Well, I have.
You know, on my back stoop...

1393
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:39,140
the lot across the street, backyard.

1394
01:14:39,559 --> 01:14:41,060
Switchblades came
with the neighborhood where I lived.

1395
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:45,060
It's funny I never thought of it before.
I guess you try to forget those things.

1396
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:48,398
- How do you use a switchblade?
- Well, you'd never use it like this.

1397
01:14:50,528 --> 01:14:52,528
See, you use too much time
switching hands.

1398
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:57,573
Here's how - underhanded.

1399
01:14:59,787 --> 01:15:02,787
Anyone who's ever used a switch knife
wouldn't handle it any other way.

1400
01:15:02,914 --> 01:15:05,626
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

1401
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:07,545
That's why they're made to open like that.

1402
01:15:07,545 --> 01:15:10,256
- You'd say the boy was pretty handy with a knife?
- Mm-hmm.

1403
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:13,256
You think he could have made
the kind of wound that killed his father?

1404
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:17,509
No. Not with the experience he'd had
all his life handling these things.

1405
01:15:17,512 --> 01:15:19,512
I feel he'd have gone for him underhanded.

1406
01:15:19,599 --> 01:15:22,599
How do you know? Were you
in the room when the father was killed?

1407
01:15:22,726 --> 01:15:24,726
No. Neither was anybody else.

1408
01:15:24,811 --> 01:15:28,106
So what are you giving us all this
mumbo jumbo for? I don't believe it.

1409
01:15:28,106 --> 01:15:31,106
I don't think you can determine what type of
wound the boy might or might not have made...

1410
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:34,154
simply because he knew
how to handle a knife.

1411
01:15:34,154 --> 01:15:36,154
What do you think?

1412
01:15:36,573 --> 01:15:38,573
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

1413
01:15:38,743 --> 01:15:40,743
I don't know.

1414
01:15:44,789 --> 01:15:46,789
How about you?

1415
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:50,712
I don't know about the rest of them, but I'm getting a
little tired of this yackety-yackin' back and forth.

1416
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:54,257
It's gettin' us nowhere.
So I guess I'll have to break it up.

1417
01:15:54,257 --> 01:15:56,257
I change my vote to not guilty.

1418
01:15:56,886 --> 01:16:00,305
- You what?
- You heard me. I've had enough.

1419
01:16:00,305 --> 01:16:02,305
What do you mean you've had enough?
That's no answer!

1420
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:06,850
Hey, listen. You just take care
of yourself, huh? You know?

1421
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:10,895
He's right. That's not an answer.

1422
01:16:10,942 --> 01:16:13,942
What kind of a man are you?

1423
01:16:13,985 --> 01:16:17,198
You have sat here and voted guilty
with everyone else...

1424
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:21,198
because there are some baseball tickets
burning a hole in your pocket.

1425
01:16:21,534 --> 01:16:25,534
And now you've changed your vote because you
say you're sick of all the talking here?

1426
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:28,333
Now listen, buddy!

1427
01:16:28,333 --> 01:16:33,088
Who tells you that you have the right
to play like this with a man's life?

1428
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:35,088
- Don't you care -
- Now wait a minute!

1429
01:16:35,675 --> 01:16:39,675
- You can't talk like that to me!
- I can talk like that to you.

1430
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:41,721
If you want to vote not guilty...

1431
01:16:41,721 --> 01:16:44,182
then do it because you are convinced
the man is not guilty...

1432
01:16:44,182 --> 01:16:45,060
not because you've had enough.

1433
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:48,060
And if you think he is guilty,
then vote that way.

1434
01:16:48,729 --> 01:16:51,024
Or don't you have the guts
to do what you think is right?

1435
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:54,024
- Now listen.
- Guilty or not guilty?

1436
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:58,069
- I told you, not guilty.
- Why?

1437
01:17:00,323 --> 01:17:01,033
Look, I don't have to...

1438
01:17:02,033 --> 01:17:05,033
You do have to! Say it! Why?

1439
01:17:05,246 --> 01:17:07,216
All right. I don't, uh, think he's guilty.

1440
01:17:17,216 --> 01:17:18,216
I want another vote.

1441
01:17:18,926 --> 01:17:21,511
Okay. There's another vote called for.

1442
01:17:21,511 --> 01:17:24,472
I guess the quickest way is a show of hands.
Anyone object?

1443
01:17:24,472 --> 01:17:27,310
Okay. All those voting not guilty,
raise your hands.

1444
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:33,310
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

1445
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:37,319
eight.

1446
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:44,036
Um, nine.

1447
01:17:45,036 --> 01:17:50,036
Um, all those voting guilty,
raise your hands.

1448
01:17:50,123 --> 01:17:52,123
One, two, three.

1449
01:17:52,585 --> 01:17:55,087
Well, the vote's nine to three
in favor of acquittal.

1450
01:17:56,087 --> 01:17:58,087
I don't understand you people!

1451
01:17:58,341 --> 01:18:00,341
I mean, all these picky little points
you keep bringing up.

1452
01:18:00,592 --> 01:18:03,012
They don't mean nothing!
You saw this kid just like I did.

1453
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:07,012
You're not gonna tell me you believe
that phony story about losing the knife...

1454
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,600
and that business
about being at the movies.

1455
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:12,685
Look, you know how these people lie.
It's born in them.

1456
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:14,771
I mean, what the heck.
I don't have to tell you.

1457
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:16,899
They don't know what the truth is.

1458
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:20,738
And let me tell you, they don't need
any real big reason to kill someone either.

1459
01:18:20,738 --> 01:18:22,573
No, sir.

1460
01:18:22,573 --> 01:18:25,573
They get drunk!
Oh, they're real big drinkers, all of 'em.

1461
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:28,701
You know that.
And bang - someone's lying in the gutter.

1462
01:18:28,953 --> 01:18:31,041
Well, nobody's blaming them for it.
That's the way they are, by nature.

1463
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:34,041
You know what I mean? Violent!

1464
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:35,210
Where are you going?

1465
01:18:35,795 --> 01:18:38,795
Î—uman life don't mean
as much to them as it does to us.

1466
01:18:39,798 --> 01:18:42,798
Look! They're lushing it up
and fighting all the time...

1467
01:18:42,885 --> 01:18:44,885
and if somebody gets killed,
so somebody gets killed!

1468
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:46,430
They don't care!

1469
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:48,430
Oh, sure, there's some good things
about 'em too.

1470
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:50,724
Look, I'm the first one to say that.

1471
01:18:50,768 --> 01:18:54,145
I've known a couple who were okay, but
that's the exception, you know what I mean?

1472
01:18:54,145 --> 01:18:57,145
Most of 'em, it's like they have no feelings.
They can do anything.

1473
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:00,653
What's going on here?

1474
01:19:00,653 --> 01:19:02,653
I'm - I'm trying to tell ya...

1475
01:19:02,779 --> 01:19:04,779
you're making a big mistake, you people.

1476
01:19:04,864 --> 01:19:07,578
This kid is a liar!
I know it. I know all about them.

1477
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:11,578
Listen to me.
They're no good.

1478
01:19:11,831 --> 01:19:14,210
There's not a one of 'em who's any good.

1479
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:18,210
I mean, what -
What's happening in here?

1480
01:19:18,753 --> 01:19:21,216
I'm speaking my piece, and you...

1481
01:19:22,216 --> 01:19:23,216
Listen to me.

1482
01:19:24,969 --> 01:19:26,511
I...

1483
01:19:26,511 --> 01:19:28,055
We're - This kid on trial here, his type...

1484
01:19:29,055 --> 01:19:31,018
Well, don't you know about them?

1485
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:36,018
Th-There's - There's a danger here.

1486
01:19:36,564 --> 01:19:38,564
These people are dangerous.

1487
01:19:38,731 --> 01:19:41,731
They're... wild.

1488
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:43,860
Listen to me.

1489
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:46,282
- Listen.
- I have.

1490
01:19:46,282 --> 01:19:49,204
Now sit down
and don't open your mouth again.

1491
01:19:53,204 --> 01:19:55,204
I was only trying to... tell you.

1492
01:20:32,453 --> 01:20:36,453
It's always difficult to keep personal
prejudice out of a thing like this.

1493
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:41,463
Wherever you run into it,
prejudice always obscures the truth.

1494
01:20:43,463 --> 01:20:45,463
I don't really know what the truth is.

1495
01:20:45,925 --> 01:20:48,136
I don't suppose anybody
will ever really know.

1496
01:20:50,136 --> 01:20:54,136
Nine of us now seem to feel
that the defendant is innocent.

1497
01:20:54,182 --> 01:20:57,182
But we're just gambling on probabilities.

1498
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:59,269
We may be wrong.

1499
01:20:59,313 --> 01:21:01,313
We may be trying to let
a guilty man go free.

1500
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:03,317
I don't know.

1501
01:21:03,317 --> 01:21:05,317
Nobody really can.

1502
01:21:05,402 --> 01:21:07,402
But we have a reasonable doubt...

1503
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:11,449
and that's something
that's very valuable in our system.

1504
01:21:11,449 --> 01:21:15,449
No jury can declare a man guilty
unless it's sure.

1505
01:21:17,456 --> 01:21:19,456
We nine can't understand...

1506
01:21:19,917 --> 01:21:22,462
how you three are still so sure.

1507
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:25,462
- Maybe you can tell us.
- I'll try.

1508
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:30,426
You've made some excellent points, but I
still believe the boy is guilty of murder...

1509
01:21:30,426 --> 01:21:32,220
and I have two reasons.

1510
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:35,220
One, the evidence
given by the woman across the street...

1511
01:21:35,431 --> 01:21:38,143
who actually saw the murder committed.

1512
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:40,143
As far as I'm concerned,
that's the most important testimony.

1513
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:44,149
And two, the fact that she
described the stabbing by saying...

1514
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:49,149
she saw the boy raise his arm over his head
and stab down into the father's chest.

1515
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:51,863
She saw him do it the wrong way.

1516
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:53,990
That's absolutely right.

1517
01:21:53,993 --> 01:21:56,662
Let's talk about this woman for a moment.

1518
01:21:56,662 --> 01:21:59,662
She said she went to bed
about 11:00 that night.

1519
01:21:59,832 --> 01:22:03,502
Her bed was next to the window,
and she could look out while lying down...

1520
01:22:03,502 --> 01:22:07,502
and see directly into the boy's room
across the street.

1521
01:22:07,672 --> 01:22:10,384
She tossed and turned for over an hour,
unable to sleep.

1522
01:22:10,384 --> 01:22:14,384
Finally, she turned toward the window
at about 10 minutes after 12:00...

1523
01:22:14,637 --> 01:22:19,637
and, as she looked out, she saw the killing
through the windows of a passing el train.

1524
01:22:19,851 --> 01:22:22,645
She said the lights went out
immediately after the killing...

1525
01:22:22,645 --> 01:22:27,444
but that she got a good look at the boy
in the act of stabbing his father.

1526
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:32,032
As far as I can see it,
this is unshakable testimony.

1527
01:22:33,032 --> 01:22:35,032
- Well, that's the whole case.
- What do you think?

1528
01:22:41,081 --> 01:22:42,081
How about you?

1529
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:46,376
I-I don't know.

1530
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:48,006
So much evidence to sift.

1531
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:50,006
This is a pretty complicated business.

1532
01:22:51,050 --> 01:22:54,050
Frankly, I don't see
how you can vote for acquittal.

1533
01:22:54,927 --> 01:22:57,347
It's not so easy to arrange
all the evidence in order.

1534
01:22:57,347 --> 01:22:59,347
You can throw out
all the other evidence!

1535
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:03,145
The woman saw him do it!
What else do you want?

1536
01:23:03,145 --> 01:23:05,104
- Yeah, well, maybe -
- Let's vote on it.

1537
01:23:05,104 --> 01:23:07,104
Okay. There's another vote called for.

1538
01:23:07,358 --> 01:23:09,275
Anybody object?

1539
01:23:09,275 --> 01:23:12,275
All right. I'm changing my vote.
He's guilty.

1540
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:14,404
Anybody else?
The vote is eight to four.

1541
01:23:14,907 --> 01:23:18,577
Why is this such a personal triumph
for you - this one vote?

1542
01:23:18,577 --> 01:23:22,122
Okay. I say we're a hung jury.
I say we take it in to the judge.

1543
01:23:22,122 --> 01:23:24,122
Î—ow about it?
I want to hear arguments.

1544
01:23:24,917 --> 01:23:27,671
You, you're the leader of the cause.
What about it?

1545
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:31,590
Let's go over it again.

1546
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:33,590
We've been over it again!

1547
01:23:33,591 --> 01:23:38,471
The boy in the gray flannel suit here is bouncin'
backwards and forwards like a tennis ball.

1548
01:23:38,471 --> 01:23:42,269
No point in getting nasty
and trying to turn this into a contest.

1549
01:23:44,269 --> 01:23:45,269
Okay.

1550
01:23:45,813 --> 01:23:48,813
Maybe we can talk about
setting some kind of time limit.

1551
01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:51,777
Yeah, once around for the deal, huh?

1552
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:55,613
It's a quarter after 6:00.

1553
01:23:55,613 --> 01:23:57,613
Someone before mentioned 7:00.

1554
01:23:57,658 --> 01:24:00,118
I think that's a point at which
we might begin to discuss...

1555
01:24:00,118 --> 01:24:03,118
the question of whether
we're a hung jury or not.

1556
01:24:03,454 --> 01:24:05,454
Don't you feel well?

1557
01:24:06,457 --> 01:24:08,457
I feel perfectly well, thank you.

1558
01:24:08,502 --> 01:24:11,296
I was saying that 7:00
would be a reasonable time.

1559
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:14,296
Uh, the reason I asked about that
was because, uh...

1560
01:24:14,298 --> 01:24:15,298
you were rubbing your nose like...

1561
01:24:15,967 --> 01:24:18,720
Oh, I'm sorry for interrupting...

1562
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,015
but you made a gesture
that reminded me of something.

1563
01:24:22,015 --> 01:24:24,015
I'm trying to settle something here.
Do you mind?

1564
01:24:24,143 --> 01:24:26,143
Well, I think this is important.

1565
01:24:27,229 --> 01:24:29,105
Thank you.

1566
01:24:29,105 --> 01:24:31,105
Now then,
I'm sure you'll pardon me for this...

1567
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:34,817
but I was wondering why
you were rubbing your nose like that.

1568
01:24:34,819 --> 01:24:36,572
Oh, come on, will ya?

1569
01:24:36,572 --> 01:24:40,572
At this point, I happen to be talking
to the gentleman sitting next to you!

1570
01:24:40,826 --> 01:24:44,162
Now, why were you rubbing
your nose like that?

1571
01:24:44,162 --> 01:24:48,162
Well, if it's any of your business, I was
rubbing it because it bothers me a little.

1572
01:24:48,332 --> 01:24:49,042
Oh. I'm sorry.

1573
01:24:50,042 --> 01:24:53,006
- Is it - Is it because of your eyeglasses?
- It is.

1574
01:24:54,006 --> 01:24:55,006
Now can we get on to something else?

1575
01:24:55,841 --> 01:25:00,511
Your eyeglasses made those two
deep impressions on the sides of your nose.

1576
01:25:00,511 --> 01:25:02,511
I hadn't noticed that before.

1577
01:25:02,765 --> 01:25:06,350
- That must be annoying.
- It is very annoying.

1578
01:25:06,350 --> 01:25:08,350
Well, I wouldn't know about that.

1579
01:25:08,353 --> 01:25:11,353
I've never worn eyeglasses.
Twenty-twenty.

1580
01:25:11,774 --> 01:25:14,235
Listen, will you come on already
with the optometrist bit?

1581
01:25:16,235 --> 01:25:19,235
The woman who testified
that she saw the killing...

1582
01:25:19,864 --> 01:25:23,411
had those same marks
on the sides of her nose.

1583
01:25:24,411 --> 01:25:26,411
Holy smokes! You know, he's right.

1584
01:25:26,704 --> 01:25:28,457
Please.

1585
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:32,293
Just give me a minute,
and I'll be finished.

1586
01:25:32,293 --> 01:25:35,213
I don't know if anyone else
noticed that about her.

1587
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:39,135
I didn't think of it then,
but I've been going over her face...

1588
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:42,135
in my mind.

1589
01:25:42,345 --> 01:25:44,345
She had those same marks.

1590
01:25:45,349 --> 01:25:49,349
- She kept rubbing them in court.
- He's right. She did do that a lot.

1591
01:25:50,561 --> 01:25:55,317
This woman was about, uh -
about 45 years old.

1592
01:25:55,317 --> 01:25:59,317
She was making a tremendous effort
to look 35...

1593
01:25:59,363 --> 01:26:01,363
for her first public appearance.

1594
01:26:01,657 --> 01:26:04,657
Heavy makeup, dyed hair...

1595
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:08,956
brand-new clothes that should have
been worn by a younger woman.

1596
01:26:08,956 --> 01:26:10,707
No glasses.

1597
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:12,458
No, women do that.

1598
01:26:12,458 --> 01:26:14,458
See if you can get the
mental picture of it.

1599
01:26:14,962 --> 01:26:16,880
What do you mean, no glasses?

1600
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,675
How do you know whether she wore glasses?
Just 'cause she was rubbing her nose?

1601
01:26:19,675 --> 01:26:21,675
Now, she had those marks. I saw 'em.

1602
01:26:21,969 --> 01:26:23,969
So what?
What do ya think that means?

1603
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:27,265
- Listen, I'm getting so sick of your yelling in here!
- Come on. Forget it.

1604
01:26:27,265 --> 01:26:30,265
Hey, listen. Listen, he's right.
I saw them too.

1605
01:26:30,351 --> 01:26:33,351
I was the closest one to her. She had these,
uh - these things on the side of her nose.

1606
01:26:33,564 --> 01:26:36,564
- What do you call those on the side?
- Well, what point are you making here?

1607
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:40,820
She had dyed hair, marks on her nose.
Well, what does that mean?

1608
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:45,703
Could those marks be made
by anything other than eyeglasses?

1609
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:51,122
No, they couldn't.

1610
01:26:51,122 --> 01:26:53,122
I didn't see any marks!

1611
01:26:54,751 --> 01:26:56,545
I did.

1612
01:26:56,545 --> 01:26:59,171
Strange, but I didn't
think about it before.

1613
01:26:59,171 --> 01:27:01,171
Well, what about the lawyer?
Why didn't he say something?

1614
01:27:01,382 --> 01:27:04,382
There are 12 people in here
concentrating on this case.

1615
01:27:04,386 --> 01:27:06,386
Eleven of us didn't think of it either.

1616
01:27:06,555 --> 01:27:09,555
Well, what about the district attorney?
Do you think he'd pull a trick like that?

1617
01:27:09,807 --> 01:27:11,807
Have her testify without her glasses?

1618
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:15,810
Did you ever see a woman who had to wear glasses and
didn't want to because she thinks they spoil her looks?

1619
01:27:15,814 --> 01:27:19,400
Okay. She had marks on her nose.

1620
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:23,154
I'm giving you that.
From glasses, right?

1621
01:27:23,154 --> 01:27:27,154
She didn't want to wear 'em out of the house
so people would think she's gorgeous.

1622
01:27:27,408 --> 01:27:31,079
But when she saw this kid killing his
father, she was in the house alone.

1623
01:27:32,079 --> 01:27:34,079
That's all.

1624
01:27:34,373 --> 01:27:38,087
- Do you wear glasses when you go to bed?
- No, I don't.

1625
01:27:40,087 --> 01:27:42,087
No one wears eyeglasses to bed.

1626
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:45,090
It's logical to assume that she wasn't
wearing them when she was in bed...

1627
01:27:45,176 --> 01:27:46,011
tossing and turning, trying to fall asleep.

1628
01:27:47,011 --> 01:27:49,011
- How do you know?
- I don't know! I'm guessing.

1629
01:27:49,430 --> 01:27:51,430
I'm also guessing that she probably
didn't put her glasses on...

1630
01:27:51,975 --> 01:27:54,185
when she turned
to look casually out of the window.

1631
01:27:54,185 --> 01:27:56,021
And she herself testified the killing
took place just as she looked out.

1632
01:27:57,021 --> 01:28:00,021
The lights went off a split second later.
She couldn't have had time to put them on then.

1633
01:28:00,149 --> 01:28:01,149
- Wait a second.
- Here's another guess.

1634
01:28:01,859 --> 01:28:05,030
Maybe she honestly thought she saw the boy
kill his father. I say she only saw a blur.

1635
01:28:06,030 --> 01:28:09,030
How do you know what she saw?
How does he know all that?

1636
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:12,537
How do you know what kind of glasses she wore?
Maybe they were sunglasses.

1637
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:15,247
Maybe she was farsighted.
What do you know about it?

1638
01:28:15,247 --> 01:28:18,247
I only know the woman's eyesight
is in question now.

1639
01:28:18,585 --> 01:28:24,585
She had to be able to identify a person
60 feet away, at night, without glasses.

1640
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:27,260
You can't send someone off to die
on evidence like that.

1641
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:29,260
Oh, don't give me that.

1642
01:28:29,345 --> 01:28:31,345
Don't you think the woman
might have made a mistake?

1643
01:28:31,597 --> 01:28:34,100
- No.
- It's not possible?

1644
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:35,100
No, it's not possible.

1645
01:28:38,689 --> 01:28:40,689
Is it possible?

1646
01:28:41,733 --> 01:28:43,572
Not guilty.

1647
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:50,324
Do you think he's guilty?

1648
01:28:50,324 --> 01:28:52,079
I think he's guilty.

1649
01:28:55,079 --> 01:28:56,079
Do you?

1650
01:28:59,626 --> 01:29:02,626
No. I'm convinced.

1651
01:29:02,753 --> 01:29:04,422
Not guilty.

1652
01:29:04,422 --> 01:29:06,298
What's the matter with you?

1653
01:29:06,298 --> 01:29:08,298
I have a reasonable doubt now.

1654
01:29:08,301 --> 01:29:09,301
Eleven to one.

1655
01:29:09,927 --> 01:29:12,927
Well, what about all the other evidence?
What about all that stuff?

1656
01:29:12,930 --> 01:29:15,100
The knife, the whole business!

1657
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:18,100
Well, you said we could throw out
all the other evidence.

1658
01:29:23,774 --> 01:29:25,774
Well, what do we do now?

1659
01:29:28,947 --> 01:29:30,698
You're alone.

1660
01:29:30,698 --> 01:29:34,698
I don't care whether I'm alone or not!
It's my right.

1661
01:29:37,706 --> 01:29:39,009
It's your right.

1662
01:29:49,009 --> 01:29:51,009
Well, what do you want?
I say he's guilty.

1663
01:29:53,055 --> 01:29:56,055
- We want to hear your arguments.
- I gave you my arguments.

1664
01:29:57,391 --> 01:29:59,391
We're not convinced.

1665
01:29:59,603 --> 01:30:02,480
We want to hear them again.

1666
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:04,154
We have as much time as it takes.

1667
01:30:10,154 --> 01:30:14,154
Everything - Every single thing
that took place in that courtroom...

1668
01:30:14,701 --> 01:30:16,701
but I mean everything -
says he's guilty.

1669
01:30:16,703 --> 01:30:19,703
What do you think,
I'm an idiot or something?

1670
01:30:20,832 --> 01:30:22,001
Why don't you take that stuff
about the old man?

1671
01:30:23,001 --> 01:30:26,001
The old man who lived there
and heard everything.

1672
01:30:27,838 --> 01:30:29,591
Or this business about the knife.

1673
01:30:29,591 --> 01:30:31,591
What? 'Cause he found another one
exactly like it?

1674
01:30:31,676 --> 01:30:35,096
The old man saw him
right there on the stairs!

1675
01:30:35,096 --> 01:30:37,096
What's the difference
how many seconds it was?

1676
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:41,100
Every single thing.

1677
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:45,520
The knife falling through
a hole in his pocket.

1678
01:30:45,774 --> 01:30:49,194
You can't prove he didn't get to the door.

1679
01:30:49,194 --> 01:30:51,194
Sure, you can take all the time,
hobble around the room.

1680
01:30:51,695 --> 01:30:54,201
But you can't prove it!

1681
01:30:56,201 --> 01:30:59,201
And what about this business
of the el and the movies?

1682
01:30:59,912 --> 01:31:02,041
There's a phony deal
if I ever heard one.

1683
01:31:03,041 --> 01:31:07,041
I'll bet ya $5,000
I'd remember the movies I saw.

1684
01:31:07,337 --> 01:31:09,337
I'm telling ya,
everything that's gone on...

1685
01:31:09,672 --> 01:31:13,592
has been twisted and turned!

1686
01:31:13,592 --> 01:31:15,592
This business with the glasses?

1687
01:31:15,761 --> 01:31:21,393
How do you know she didn't have them on?
This woman testified in open court!

1688
01:31:21,393 --> 01:31:25,393
And what about hearing the kid yell, huh?

1689
01:31:25,438 --> 01:31:28,438
I'm telling ya, I've got
all the facts here.

1690
01:31:29,859 --> 01:31:31,113
Here. Ah...

1691
01:31:34,113 --> 01:31:36,113
Well, that's it!
That's the whole case.

1692
01:31:43,832 --> 01:31:45,711
Well?

1693
01:31:47,711 --> 01:31:49,711
Say something!

1694
01:31:54,842 --> 01:31:58,096
You lousy bunch of bleeding hearts.

1695
01:31:59,096 --> 01:32:01,096
You're not gonna intimidate me.

1696
01:32:01,099 --> 01:32:03,099
I'm entitled to my opinion.

1697
01:32:06,979 --> 01:32:11,113
Rotten kids.
You work your life out!

1698
01:32:16,113 --> 01:32:18,113
I can't keep...

1699
01:32:22,746 --> 01:32:24,292
No.

1700
01:32:28,292 --> 01:32:30,292
Not guilty.

1701
01:32:33,506 --> 01:32:35,177
Not guilty.

1702
01:32:38,177 --> 01:32:39,177
Not...

1703
01:32:50,356 --> 01:32:52,180
Um, we're ready now.

1704
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:47,180
Hey!

1705
01:34:52,186 --> 01:34:53,186
What's your name?

1706
01:34:53,938 --> 01:34:55,523
Davis.

1707
01:34:55,523 --> 01:34:57,523
My name's McCardle.

1708
01:34:59,778 --> 01:35:01,529
Well, so long.

1709
01:35:01,529 --> 01:35:03,000
So long.
