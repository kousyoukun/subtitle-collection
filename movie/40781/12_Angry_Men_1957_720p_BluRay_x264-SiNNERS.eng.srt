1
00:00:47,286 --> 00:00:50,312


2
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:08,235
You did a wonderful job. Wonderful!

3
00:01:14,847 --> 00:01:20,149
You've listened to a long and complex case, murder in the first degree.

4
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:25,222
Premeditated murder is the most serious charge tried in our criminal courts.

5
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:29,918
You've listened to the testimony. You've had the law interpreted to you.

6
00:01:30,095 --> 00:01:34,759
lt is now your duty to sit down and separate the facts from the fancy.

7
00:01:34,933 --> 00:01:39,131
One man is dead. Another man's life is at stake.

8
00:01:39,304 --> 00:01:43,263
lf there's a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused...

9
00:01:43,442 --> 00:01:48,175
...a reasonable doubt, then you must bring me a verdict of not guilty.

10
00:01:48,347 --> 00:01:52,340
lf there's no reasonable doubt, you must in good conscience...

11
00:01:52,518 --> 00:01:55,282
...find the accused guilty.

12
00:01:55,454 --> 00:01:59,254
However you decide, your verdict must be unanimous.

13
00:01:59,424 --> 00:02:05,886
lf you find the accused guilty, the bench will not consider any mercy.

14
00:02:06,064 --> 00:02:09,522
The death sentence is mandatory in this case.

15
00:02:10,002 --> 00:02:15,065
You are faced with a grave responsibility. Thank you, gentlemen.

16
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,403
The alternate jurors are excused.

17
00:02:23,415 --> 00:02:26,111
The jury will now retire.

18
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:05,083


19
00:04:46,191 --> 00:04:47,681
Piece of gum?

20
00:04:47,859 --> 00:04:52,489
-No, thanks. -This thing isn't moving.

21
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,501
Give me a hand. That's it.

22
00:05:03,007 --> 00:05:06,340
You know something? l called the weather bureau.

23
00:05:06,511 --> 00:05:10,174
This is going to be the hottest day of the year.

24
00:05:10,348 --> 00:05:14,375
-You'd think they'd air-condition. -What is your name, sir?

25
00:05:14,552 --> 00:05:16,782
-lt's that one. -Thank you very much.

26
00:05:16,955 --> 00:05:19,856
Okay, gentlemen. Everybody's here.

27
00:05:20,024 --> 00:05:24,791
lf there's anything you want, l'll be right outside the door. Just knock.

28
00:05:37,742 --> 00:05:40,404
l never knew they locked the door.

29
00:05:40,578 --> 00:05:43,638
Sure they lock the door. What'd you think?

30
00:05:43,815 --> 00:05:46,875
l don't know. lt just never occurred to me.

31
00:05:47,685 --> 00:05:51,553
-What's that for? -l thought we might vote by ballot.

32
00:05:51,723 --> 00:05:55,523
Great idea. Maybe we can get him elected senator.

33
00:06:01,866 --> 00:06:05,632
-How'd you like it? -l don't know. lt was interesting.

34
00:06:05,803 --> 00:06:08,237
Yeah? l almost fell asleep.

35
00:06:08,406 --> 00:06:14,276
-l've never been on a jury before. -Yeah? l've sat on many juries.

36
00:06:14,445 --> 00:06:19,542
What gets me is how the lawyers talk, even when it's an open-and-shut case.

37
00:06:19,717 --> 00:06:23,483
-Ever hear so much talk about nothing? -They're entitled.

38
00:06:23,655 --> 00:06:26,556
They're entitled. lt's the system.

39
00:06:26,724 --> 00:06:31,058
l'd slap those tough kids down before they start any trouble.

40
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:33,129
lt'd save us time and money.

41
00:06:33,298 --> 00:06:35,163
-Let's get started. -Good idea.

42
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,961
Let's get going. We all have things to do.

43
00:06:38,136 --> 00:06:42,197
Let's start with a five-minute break. One man's in the bathroom.

44
00:06:42,373 --> 00:06:47,174
-Are we going to sit normal? -l don't know. l guess so.

45
00:06:51,616 --> 00:06:53,049
You're in my seat.

46
00:06:53,218 --> 00:06:55,618
-Excuse me. -That's all right.

47
00:06:57,689 --> 00:07:00,089
Hey, that's not a bad view, huh?

48
00:07:02,994 --> 00:07:05,258
What'd you think of the case?

49
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:11,494
lt had a lot of interest for me. No real dead spots, you know what l mean?

50
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:14,194
We were lucky to get a murder case.

51
00:07:14,372 --> 00:07:18,741
l figured us for an assault or burglary. They can be the dullest.

52
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:24,671
-Hey, is that the Woolworth Building? -That's right.

53
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:29,409
l've lived here all my life, and l've never been inside that.

54
00:07:29,587 --> 00:07:33,717
You had to sort out that junk, like the thing with the movies.

55
00:07:33,891 --> 00:07:36,826
Yeah. What about that business with the knife?

56
00:07:36,995 --> 00:07:39,896
Asking grown-up people to believe that jaZZ.

57
00:07:40,064 --> 00:07:44,364
-l expected that. Look what we've got. -Yeah, l guess so.

58
00:07:44,636 --> 00:07:48,936
Well, your horn works, now try your lights. What've you got, a cold?

59
00:07:49,107 --> 00:07:54,443
These hot-weather colds can kill you. l can hardly touch my nose, you know?

60
00:07:54,612 --> 00:07:58,048
l sure do. l just got over one.

61
00:07:58,216 --> 00:08:02,812
-Come on, Mr. Foreman, let's go here. -The guy's still in the bathroom.

62
00:08:02,987 --> 00:08:06,650
What's new? l didn't get a chance to see a paper.

63
00:08:06,824 --> 00:08:11,955
-l was wondering how the market closed. -You got a seat on the exchange?

64
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,722
l'm a broker.

65
00:08:13,898 --> 00:08:18,267
l run a messenger service. The Beck and Call Company.

66
00:08:18,436 --> 00:08:24,136
The name is my wife's idea. l got 37 men working, started with nothing.

67
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:27,801
Okay, men. Let's take our seats.

68
00:08:30,682 --> 00:08:35,813
Yeah. We can all get out pretty quick. l have tickets to tonight's ball game.

69
00:08:35,987 --> 00:08:37,579
Yanks and Cleveland.

70
00:08:37,755 --> 00:08:42,920
Yeah, we got this kid, Modjelewski, in there. He's a real bull, this kid.

71
00:08:43,661 --> 00:08:46,255
A real jug handle. You know?

72
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,657
You're a real baseball fan, aren't you?

73
00:08:50,835 --> 00:08:52,166
Where do we sit?

74
00:08:52,337 --> 00:08:55,329
l thought we'd sit in order. By jury numbers.

75
00:08:55,506 --> 00:08:59,340
One, two, three and so on around the table, if that's okay.

76
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,343
-What's the difference? -lt's reasonable.

77
00:09:02,513 --> 00:09:05,107
-Let it be. -Twelve is to your right?

78
00:09:05,283 --> 00:09:09,049
-Well, we go around clockwise. -Start with you, one, two....

79
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,656
What was your impression of the prosecuting attorney?

80
00:09:13,324 --> 00:09:14,621
l beg pardon?

81
00:09:14,792 --> 00:09:19,058
l thought he was sharp, the way he hammered all those points one by one...

82
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,063
...in a logical sequence. l was very impressed.

83
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:28,468
-l think he did an expert job. -A lot of drive too, real drive.

84
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,971
-Fellows. Can we hold it down? -Sure.

85
00:09:31,142 --> 00:09:36,239
Say, we'd like to get started. Gentleman at the window.

86
00:09:37,148 --> 00:09:39,343
-We'd like to get started. -l'm sorry.

87
00:09:39,517 --> 00:09:43,248
Pretty tough to figure, isn't it, kid kills his father?

88
00:09:43,421 --> 00:09:45,981
Listen, you see that all the time.

89
00:09:46,157 --> 00:09:51,026
They let those kids run wild. Well, maybe it serves him right, you know?

90
00:09:51,195 --> 00:09:54,358
-ls everyone here? -The old man is inside.

91
00:09:54,532 --> 00:09:57,501
-Would you knock on the door for him? -Yeah.

92
00:09:57,668 --> 00:10:00,865
-You a Yankee fan? -No. Baltimore.

93
00:10:01,606 --> 00:10:03,039
Baltimore?

94
00:10:04,175 --> 00:10:08,305
That's like being hit in the head with a crowbar once a day.

95
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:12,313
What've they got? Who they got besides good groundskeepers?

96
00:10:12,483 --> 00:10:14,280
We'd like to get started.

97
00:10:14,452 --> 00:10:17,751
Forgive me. l didn't mean to keep you waiting.

98
00:10:17,922 --> 00:10:19,651
Baltimore!

99
00:10:19,824 --> 00:10:22,384
Okay, gentlemen. lf l can have your attention.

100
00:10:23,294 --> 00:10:28,322
You fellows can handle this any way you want. l'm not going to make any rules.

101
00:10:28,499 --> 00:10:34,404
We can discuss it first and then vote on it. Of course, that's one way.

102
00:10:34,572 --> 00:10:37,268
And, well, we can vote on it right now.

103
00:10:37,442 --> 00:10:40,104
l think a preliminary vote is customary.

104
00:10:40,278 --> 00:10:44,977
Yeah, let's vote. Who knows, maybe we can all get out of here.

105
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:51,648
Okay, then. Of course you know that we have a first-degree murder charge...

106
00:10:51,823 --> 00:10:57,887
...and if we vote the accused guilty, we've got to send him to the chair.

107
00:10:58,362 --> 00:11:00,626
-That's mandatory. -We know that.

108
00:11:00,798 --> 00:11:04,859
-Yeah. Let's see who's where. -Anyone doesn't want to vote?

109
00:11:05,036 --> 00:11:07,027
lt's all right with me.

110
00:11:07,738 --> 00:11:13,802
Remember that this has to be 1 2 to nothing, either way. That's the law.

111
00:11:13,978 --> 00:11:20,110
Okay, are we ready? Now, all those voting guilty, please raise your hands.

112
00:11:23,187 --> 00:11:27,715
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

113
00:11:27,892 --> 00:11:33,262
...eight, nine, ten, eleven. Okay, that's eleven guilty.

114
00:11:33,431 --> 00:11:35,456
Who's voting not guilty?

115
00:11:36,133 --> 00:11:41,469
One. Right. Eleven, guilty. One, not guilty.

116
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:47,771
-Well, now we know where we are. -Boy, oh, boy, there's always one.

117
00:11:47,945 --> 00:11:50,106
So, what do we do now?

118
00:11:50,815 --> 00:11:53,545
-l guess we talk. -Boy, oh, boy.

119
00:11:53,718 --> 00:11:56,152
You really think he's innocent?

120
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,817
-l don't know. -You sat in court with the rest of us.

121
00:12:02,994 --> 00:12:05,792
You could see the kid's a dangerous killer.

122
00:12:05,963 --> 00:12:09,399
-He's 1 8 years old. -Well, that's old enough.

123
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:12,297
He stabbed his own father in the chest.

124
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:17,237
They proved it a doZen ways in court. Would you like me to list them?

125
00:12:17,408 --> 00:12:18,670
No.

126
00:12:19,143 --> 00:12:22,112
-Then what do you want? -l just want to talk.

127
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:27,616
Talk about what? Eleven say, ''guilty.'' Nobody has to think about it but you.

128
00:12:27,785 --> 00:12:30,811
l want to ask you. Do you believe his story?

129
00:12:30,988 --> 00:12:35,425
-l don't know if l do. Maybe l don't. -So how come you vote not guilty?

130
00:12:35,593 --> 00:12:39,222
With 1 1 votes for guilty, it's not easy to raise my hand...

131
00:12:39,397 --> 00:12:42,457
...and send a boy to die without talking about it.

132
00:12:42,633 --> 00:12:45,761
-Well, now, who says it's easy? -No one.

133
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:50,832
What, just because l voted fast? l honestly think the guy's guilty.

134
00:12:51,008 --> 00:12:53,670
Talking for 1 00 years couldn't change my mind.

135
00:12:53,844 --> 00:12:58,781
l'm not trying to. lt's just that we're talking about somebody's life.

136
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,009
Supposing we're wrong!

137
00:13:01,185 --> 00:13:05,588
Supposing this building should fall. You could suppose anything.

138
00:13:05,756 --> 00:13:07,155
That's right.

139
00:13:07,358 --> 00:13:11,692
What's the difference how long? Suppose we do it in 5 minutes?

140
00:13:12,463 --> 00:13:16,729
Let's take an hour. The ball game doesn't start until 8:00.

141
00:13:21,973 --> 00:13:25,374
-Who's got something to say? -l'll sit for an hour.

142
00:13:25,543 --> 00:13:30,845
-Great. l heard a pretty good story-- -That's not why we're sitting here.

143
00:13:31,015 --> 00:13:35,782
All right, then you tell me. What are we sitting here for?

144
00:13:35,953 --> 00:13:42,222
l don't know, maybe no reason. This kid's been kicked around all his life.

145
00:13:42,393 --> 00:13:46,261
You know, born in a slum, mother dead since he was 9.

146
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:51,663
A year and a half in an orphanage when his father was in jail for forgery.

147
00:13:51,836 --> 00:13:57,775
That's not a very happy beginning. He's a wild, angry kid. And you know why?

148
00:13:57,942 --> 00:14:01,878
Because he's been hit on the head by somebody every day.

149
00:14:02,046 --> 00:14:07,211
He's had a pretty miserable 1 8 years. l think we owe him a few words.

150
00:14:07,385 --> 00:14:11,879
We don't owe him a thing. He got a fair trial, didn't he?

151
00:14:12,056 --> 00:14:16,755
What do you think that trial cost? He's lucky he got it, you know?

152
00:14:16,927 --> 00:14:21,091
Look, we're all grownups in here. We heard the facts, didn't we?

153
00:14:21,265 --> 00:14:25,201
We're not supposed to believe this kid, knowing what he is.

154
00:14:25,369 --> 00:14:31,069
l've lived among them. You can't believe what they say. You know that.

155
00:14:31,242 --> 00:14:35,303
-They're born liars. -Only an ignorant man can believe that.

156
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:37,572
-Listen. -Were you born...

157
00:14:37,748 --> 00:14:42,378
...with a monopoly on the truth? Certain things must be pointed out to him.

158
00:14:42,553 --> 00:14:47,422
-We don't need a sermon. -We have a job to do, let's do it.

159
00:14:47,591 --> 00:14:51,220
Rice Pops. lt's a product l work on at the agency.

160
00:14:51,395 --> 00:14:54,887
''The breakfast with the built-in bounce.'' l wrote that.

161
00:14:55,066 --> 00:14:56,431
-Very catchy. -Yeah.

162
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,797
-Do you mind? -l'm sorry.

163
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:02,438
Doodling keeps me thinking clearly.

164
00:15:02,606 --> 00:15:05,837
We have work. There's no point staying forever.

165
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:12,176
Okay. Now, perhaps if the gentleman down there who's disagreeing with us...

166
00:15:12,349 --> 00:15:17,912
...perhaps you could say why. We might show you where you're mixed-up.

167
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:21,650
Maybe this is an idea. l haven't given it much thought.

168
00:15:21,826 --> 00:15:26,957
lt seems it's up to us to convince him that he's wrong and we're right.

169
00:15:27,131 --> 00:15:31,966
Maybe if we each took a couple of minutes just to-- lt was just an idea.

170
00:15:32,136 --> 00:15:37,141
No, no, no. That's a good one. Suppose we go once around the table.

171
00:15:37,141 --> 00:15:39,041
l guess you're first.

172
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:48,213
lt's hard to put into words. l just think he's guilty.

173
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:52,378
l thought it was obvious from the word go. Nobody proved otherwise.

174
00:15:52,556 --> 00:15:56,515
Nobody has to. The burden of proof is on the prosecution.

175
00:15:56,694 --> 00:16:00,994
The defendant doesn't have to speak. That's in the Constitution.

176
00:16:01,165 --> 00:16:04,760
Sure, l know that. What l meant was--

177
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:09,801
Well, l just think he's guilty. Somebody saw him do it.

178
00:16:09,974 --> 00:16:15,173
Okay. Here's what l think, and l have no personal feelings about this...

179
00:16:15,346 --> 00:16:17,974
...l just want to talk about facts.

180
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:19,548
Number one:

181
00:16:20,851 --> 00:16:25,083
The old man lived under the room where the killing took place.

182
00:16:25,256 --> 00:16:30,717
At 1 2:1 0, on the night of the killing, he heard loud noises, like a fight.

183
00:16:30,895 --> 00:16:33,887
And he heard the kid yell, ''l'm gonna kill you.''

184
00:16:34,065 --> 00:16:36,465
A second later, a body hit the floor.

185
00:16:36,634 --> 00:16:40,730
Ran to the door and saw the kid run down the stairs and leave.

186
00:16:40,905 --> 00:16:45,035
Called the police. They found the man with a knife in his chest.

187
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:48,508
The coroner fixed the time of death around midnight.

188
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:53,446
These are facts. You can't refute facts. The kid is guilty.

189
00:16:53,617 --> 00:16:57,553
l'm as sentimental as the next fellow. l know he's only 1 8.

190
00:16:57,722 --> 00:17:00,885
-He's still got to pay for it. -l'm with you.

191
00:17:01,058 --> 00:17:03,583
Okay, you finished?

192
00:17:03,761 --> 00:17:05,126
-Yeah. -Next.

193
00:17:05,296 --> 00:17:08,754
lt is obvious that the boy's entire story was flimsy.

194
00:17:08,933 --> 00:17:11,026
He claimed he was at the movies...

195
00:17:11,202 --> 00:17:14,797
...yet he couldn't remember the film's names or actors.

196
00:17:14,972 --> 00:17:17,873
-That's right. -No one saw him going in or out.

197
00:17:18,042 --> 00:17:21,876
What about the testimony of the woman across the street?

198
00:17:22,046 --> 00:17:26,608
-She was the one who saw the killing. -Now, fellows. Let's go in order.

199
00:17:26,784 --> 00:17:32,381
Just a minute. Here's a woman who's lying in bed. She can't sleep.

200
00:17:32,556 --> 00:17:34,922
She's dying with the heat, you know?

201
00:17:35,092 --> 00:17:41,429
She looks out the window and sees the kid stick the knife into his father.

202
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:47,094
The time is 1 2:1 0. Everything fits. She's known the kid all his life.

203
00:17:47,271 --> 00:17:50,832
His window is across the El tracks. She saw him do it.

204
00:17:51,008 --> 00:17:53,738
Through the windows of a passing El train.

205
00:17:54,045 --> 00:17:57,981
This El train had no passengers. lt was being moved downtown.

206
00:17:58,149 --> 00:17:59,707
The lights were out.

207
00:17:59,884 --> 00:18:03,081
They proved that you can look through the windows...

208
00:18:03,254 --> 00:18:06,746
...when the lights are out and see the other side.

209
00:18:06,924 --> 00:18:08,721
l'd like to ask you something.

210
00:18:08,893 --> 00:18:15,196
You don't believe the boy's story, why the woman's? She's one of ''them'' too.

211
00:18:16,233 --> 00:18:20,169
-You're a smart fellow, aren't you? -Gentlemen, gentlemen.

212
00:18:20,337 --> 00:18:24,671
-Come on. Sit down, sit down. -What's he so wise about?

213
00:18:24,842 --> 00:18:29,302
Come on, we're not going to get anywhere fighting. Whose turn is it?

214
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,108
His, number five.

215
00:18:35,453 --> 00:18:37,580
Can l pass?

216
00:18:38,122 --> 00:18:43,150
Well, that's your privilege. How about the next gentleman?

217
00:18:44,328 --> 00:18:50,756
Well, l don't know. l started to be convinced very early in the case.

218
00:18:50,935 --> 00:18:54,029
You see, l was looking for a motive.

219
00:18:54,205 --> 00:18:59,609
lt's important because if you don't have a motive, where's your case?

220
00:18:59,777 --> 00:19:05,306
That testimony from the people across the hall from the kid's apartment...

221
00:19:05,483 --> 00:19:07,474
...that was very powerful.

222
00:19:07,651 --> 00:19:11,109
Didn't they say something about a fight, an argument...

223
00:19:11,288 --> 00:19:16,851
...between the old man and his son, around 7:00? l could be wrong, but l--

224
00:19:17,027 --> 00:19:18,892
-lt was 8:00. -That's right.

225
00:19:19,063 --> 00:19:22,191
They heard an argument, couldn't hear about what.

226
00:19:22,366 --> 00:19:24,960
They heard the father hit the boy twice.

227
00:19:25,136 --> 00:19:29,129
They saw the boy run angry out of the house. What's that prove?

228
00:19:29,306 --> 00:19:32,673
lt don't prove anything. lt's part of the picture.

229
00:19:32,843 --> 00:19:37,542
You said it provided a motive. l don't think it was a very strong motive.

230
00:19:37,715 --> 00:19:43,915
This boy has been hit so many times that violence is normal to him.

231
00:19:44,088 --> 00:19:48,650
l can't see two slaps in the face provoking him into committing murder.

232
00:19:48,826 --> 00:19:52,762
lt may have been two too many. Everyone has a breaking point.

233
00:19:54,298 --> 00:19:55,788
Anything else?

234
00:19:56,734 --> 00:20:00,830
-No. -Okay. How about you?

235
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,538
l don't know. lt's all been said.

236
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:09,571
You can talk here forever. lt's still the same thing.

237
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,175
This kid is 5 for 0.

238
00:20:13,017 --> 00:20:14,780
Well, look at his record.

239
00:20:14,952 --> 00:20:19,082
At 1 0, he was in children's court. He threw a rock at a teacher.

240
00:20:19,256 --> 00:20:23,352
When he was 1 5, he was in reform school. He stole a car.

241
00:20:23,527 --> 00:20:25,825
He's been arrested for mugging.

242
00:20:25,996 --> 00:20:31,229
He was picked up twice for knife fighting. He's real handy with a knife.

243
00:20:31,402 --> 00:20:33,063
This is a very fine boy.

244
00:20:33,237 --> 00:20:37,731
Since he was 5, his father beat him up regularly with his fists.

245
00:20:37,908 --> 00:20:40,138
So would l. A kid like that....

246
00:20:40,311 --> 00:20:44,441
lt's these kids, the way they are nowadays.

247
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:51,144
When l was a kid, l used to call my father ''sir.'' That's right. Sir.

248
00:20:51,322 --> 00:20:56,385
-You hear a kid call his father that? -Fathers don't think it's important.

249
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,154
-You got any kids? -Three.

250
00:21:00,097 --> 00:21:01,689
l got one.

251
00:21:03,033 --> 00:21:05,558
He's 22 years old.

252
00:21:10,808 --> 00:21:14,608
When he was 9 years old, he ran away from a fight.

253
00:21:15,246 --> 00:21:19,342
l saw it. l was so embarrassed l almost threw up.

254
00:21:20,351 --> 00:21:25,880
l said, ''l'll make a man out of you if l have to break you in two trying.''

255
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:33,059
Well, l made a man out of him. When he was 1 6, we had a fight.

256
00:21:33,731 --> 00:21:37,292
He hit me in the jaw. He was a big kid.

257
00:21:39,737 --> 00:21:42,501
l haven't seen him for two years.

258
00:21:44,975 --> 00:21:46,602
Kids.

259
00:21:47,578 --> 00:21:50,138
Work your heart out....

260
00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:55,778
-Well, let's get going. -l think we're missing the point.

261
00:21:55,953 --> 00:22:00,481
He's from a broken home in a filthy neighborhood. We can't help that.

262
00:22:00,658 --> 00:22:05,960
We decide if he's innocent or guilty, not to go into how he grew up.

263
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:10,726
He was born in a slum, breeding grounds for criminals. We all know it.

264
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:15,634
lt's no secret. Children from slums are potential menaces to society.

265
00:22:15,806 --> 00:22:17,967
-Now, l-- -You can say that again.

266
00:22:18,142 --> 00:22:22,511
The kids from those places are trash. l don't want any part of them.

267
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:26,138
Listen, l've lived in a slum all my life.

268
00:22:26,317 --> 00:22:27,944
-Wait a minute. -Please!

269
00:22:28,118 --> 00:22:30,951
l played in back yards filled with garbage.

270
00:22:31,121 --> 00:22:33,817
-Maybe you can smell it on me. -Listen.

271
00:22:33,991 --> 00:22:36,892
-There's nothing personal. -lt was personal.

272
00:22:37,061 --> 00:22:40,053
He didn't mean you. Let's not be so sensitive.

273
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:44,633
-This sensitivity l can understand. -Okay, let's stop the arguing.

274
00:22:44,802 --> 00:22:50,604
We're only wasting time. lt's your turn down there. Let's go.

275
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:55,508
l thought you were all trying to convince me. Wasn't that the idea?

276
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,510
-That was the idea. -l forgot.

277
00:22:57,681 --> 00:23:01,310
He's the one who's keeping us here. Let's hear him.

278
00:23:01,485 --> 00:23:05,353
We decided to do this a certain way. We ought to stick to it.

279
00:23:05,522 --> 00:23:08,252
-Stop being a kid. -What do you mean, ''a kid''?

280
00:23:08,425 --> 00:23:12,225
What do you think l mean? K-l-D, kid.

281
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:17,460
Just because l'm trying to keep organiZed?

282
00:23:17,634 --> 00:23:21,570
You take it. Take the responsibility. l'll keep my mouth shut.

283
00:23:21,739 --> 00:23:24,003
Why are you getting hot? Calm down.

284
00:23:24,174 --> 00:23:27,302
Don't tell me to calm down. Just take the chair.

285
00:23:27,478 --> 00:23:29,810
Did you ever see such a thing?

286
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:33,438
-You think it's funny? -Forget it. lt's unimportant.

287
00:23:33,617 --> 00:23:36,984
-Unimportant? You try it. -No, nobody wants to change.

288
00:23:37,154 --> 00:23:41,591
-You're doing a beautiful job. Sit down -Yeah, you're doing great.

289
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:44,057
Just stay in there and pitch.

290
00:23:44,461 --> 00:23:47,430
All right, let's hear from somebody.

291
00:23:48,065 --> 00:23:52,229
lf you want me to say how l feel about it, it's all right with me.

292
00:23:52,403 --> 00:23:54,371
Boy, l don't care what you do.

293
00:23:54,538 --> 00:23:59,475
All right, l don't have anything brilliant. l know as much as you do.

294
00:23:59,643 --> 00:24:03,340
According to testimony, the boy looks guilty. Maybe he is.

295
00:24:03,514 --> 00:24:08,076
l sat there in court for six days listening while the evidence built up.

296
00:24:08,252 --> 00:24:12,882
Everybody sounded so positive. l got a peculiar feeling about this trial.

297
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:17,356
Nothing is that positive. There are questions l'd have liked to ask.

298
00:24:17,528 --> 00:24:19,689
Maybe they'd have meant nothing.

299
00:24:19,863 --> 00:24:25,267
But l felt that the defense wasn't doing a thorough cross-examination.

300
00:24:25,436 --> 00:24:29,031
-He let things go by, little things. -What little things?

301
00:24:29,206 --> 00:24:33,700
When fellows don't ask questions, it's because they know the answers.

302
00:24:33,877 --> 00:24:37,506
lt's also possible for a lawyer to be stupid, isn't it?

303
00:24:37,681 --> 00:24:42,345
-l mean, it's possible. -Sounds like you met my brother-in-law.

304
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,212
l kept putting myself in the kid's place.

305
00:24:47,925 --> 00:24:52,828
l'd have asked for another lawyer. l mean, if l was on trial for my life...

306
00:24:52,996 --> 00:24:57,660
...l'd want my lawyer to tear their witnesses to shreds, or try to.

307
00:24:57,835 --> 00:25:01,931
Look, there was one alleged eyewitness to this killing.

308
00:25:02,105 --> 00:25:05,905
Someone else heard the killing, saw the boy run afterwards...

309
00:25:06,076 --> 00:25:08,567
...and there was circumstantial evidence.

310
00:25:08,745 --> 00:25:13,239
Those two witnesses were the entire case. Supposing they're wrong?

311
00:25:13,417 --> 00:25:17,148
What do you mean? What's the point of having witnesses?

312
00:25:17,321 --> 00:25:18,879
Could they be wrong?

313
00:25:19,056 --> 00:25:21,616
Those people sat on the stand under oath.

314
00:25:21,792 --> 00:25:25,592
They're people. People make mistakes. Could they be wrong?

315
00:25:25,762 --> 00:25:28,595
-Well, no. l don't think so. -Do you know so?

316
00:25:28,765 --> 00:25:32,223
Nobody can know that. This isn't an exact science.

317
00:25:32,469 --> 00:25:39,009
That's right, it isn't.

318
00:25:39,009 --> 00:25:44,811
Let's get to the point. What about the switch knife in the old man's chest?

319
00:25:44,982 --> 00:25:47,143
Wait. Some people haven't talked.

320
00:25:47,317 --> 00:25:51,344
-Shouldn't we go in order? -They'll get a chance. Be quiet.

321
00:25:51,522 --> 00:25:57,654
What about this knife the boy admitted buying that night? Let's talk about it.

322
00:25:57,828 --> 00:26:01,059
All right, let's talk about it. Let's look at it.

323
00:26:01,231 --> 00:26:03,756
-Mr. Foreman. -We saw what it looks like.

324
00:26:03,934 --> 00:26:08,496
-Why do we have to see it again? -He has a right to see evidence.

325
00:26:09,606 --> 00:26:12,404
-Could you bring us the knife? -All right.

326
00:26:14,344 --> 00:26:17,609
The knife is strong evidence, don't you think?

327
00:26:17,781 --> 00:26:19,248
-l do. -Good.

328
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:21,976
Suppose we take the facts one at a time.

329
00:26:22,152 --> 00:26:27,590
One: The boy left the house at 8:00 after being slapped by his father.

330
00:26:27,758 --> 00:26:32,354
No, he didn't say, ''slapped.'' He said, ''punched.'' There's a difference.

331
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:35,259
After being hit several times by his father.

332
00:26:35,432 --> 00:26:39,198
Two: He went to a neighborhood junk shop and bought a....

333
00:26:39,369 --> 00:26:41,735
-Switch knife. -Switchblade knife.

334
00:26:41,905 --> 00:26:46,638
This wasn't an ordinary knife. lt had an unusual carved handle and blade.

335
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:51,270
The storekeeper said it was the only one of its kind he'd ever had.

336
00:26:51,448 --> 00:26:56,545
Three: He met some friends in front of a tavern about 8:45. Am l right?

337
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,813
-Yes, you are. -You bet he is.

338
00:26:58,989 --> 00:27:02,083
He talked with his friends, leaving them at 9:45.

339
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:05,160
During this time, they saw the switch knife.

340
00:27:05,329 --> 00:27:11,757
Four: They identified the death weapon in court as that very same knife.

341
00:27:11,935 --> 00:27:14,802
Five: He arrived home at about 1 0:00.

342
00:27:14,972 --> 00:27:19,341
This is where the stories by the state and the boy begin to diverge.

343
00:27:19,509 --> 00:27:22,000
He claims he went to a movie at 1 1 :30...

344
00:27:22,179 --> 00:27:26,377
...returning at 3:1 0 to find his father dead and himself arrested.

345
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:30,816
He also claims the two detectives threw him down a flight of stairs.

346
00:27:30,988 --> 00:27:35,789
What happened to the knife? He claims it fell through a hole in his pocket...

347
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:40,259
...sometime between 1 1 :30 and 3:1 0 and that he never saw it again.

348
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:45,458
Now there's a tale. l think it's clear that the boy never went to the movies.

349
00:27:45,636 --> 00:27:49,538
No one saw him go out at 1 1 :30. No one in the theater saw him.

350
00:27:49,706 --> 00:27:52,641
He couldn't remember the names of the pictures.

351
00:27:54,478 --> 00:27:57,641
What happened is this. The boy stayed home.

352
00:27:57,814 --> 00:28:03,150
Had a fight with his father, stabbed him and left the house at 1 2:1 0.

353
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,289
He even wiped the knife clean of fingerprints.

354
00:28:06,456 --> 00:28:10,984
Are you saying that this knife fell through a hole in the boy's pocket?

355
00:28:11,161 --> 00:28:14,927
Someone picked it up, went to the house and stabbed his father...

356
00:28:15,098 --> 00:28:16,395
...to test its sharpness?

357
00:28:16,566 --> 00:28:22,004
lt's possible he lost it and his father was stabbed with a similar knife.

358
00:28:22,172 --> 00:28:24,003
Take a look at this knife.

359
00:28:25,509 --> 00:28:27,500
lt's a very unusual knife.

360
00:28:27,678 --> 00:28:32,172
l've never seen one like it. Neither had the storekeeper who sold it.

361
00:28:32,349 --> 00:28:35,045
lsn't that a pretty incredible coincidence?

362
00:28:35,419 --> 00:28:39,048
-l'm saying a coincidence is possible. -l say it's not.

363
00:28:45,629 --> 00:28:48,792
-Where did that come from? -lt's the same knife.

364
00:28:48,966 --> 00:28:52,458
-What do you think you're doing? -Where did you get it?

365
00:28:52,636 --> 00:28:56,766
l went out walking last night through the boy's neighborhood.

366
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:01,934
l bought it at a pawnshop two blocks from the boy's house. lt cost $6.

367
00:29:02,112 --> 00:29:04,979
lt's against the law to buy a switchblade.

368
00:29:05,148 --> 00:29:08,481
-l broke the law. -You pulled a real bright trick.

369
00:29:08,652 --> 00:29:13,180
Tell me what it proves. Maybe there are 1 0 knives like that. So what?

370
00:29:13,357 --> 00:29:15,848
-Maybe there are. -What does it mean?

371
00:29:16,026 --> 00:29:19,223
You found a knife like it. ls that some big discovery?

372
00:29:19,396 --> 00:29:23,526
We're to believe somebody else did it with a similar knife?

373
00:29:23,734 --> 00:29:26,635
-The odds are a million-to-1 . -lt's possible.

374
00:29:26,803 --> 00:29:28,930
But not very probable.

375
00:29:29,106 --> 00:29:34,339
Okay. Let's take our seats. There's no point in standing around all over....

376
00:29:34,578 --> 00:29:38,173
lt's interesting that he'd find a knife like the boy's.

377
00:29:38,348 --> 00:29:42,842
-What's interesting about it? -l don't know. l just thought it was.

378
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,511
There's 1 1 of us who think he's guilty.

379
00:29:45,689 --> 00:29:49,147
What will you accomplish? You won't change our minds.

380
00:29:49,326 --> 00:29:55,663
Be stubborn and hang this jury. He'll be tried again and found guilty.

381
00:29:56,466 --> 00:29:59,867
-You're probably right. -So, what are you gonna do?

382
00:30:00,037 --> 00:30:04,736
-We could be here all night. -lt's only one night. A boy may die.

383
00:30:04,908 --> 00:30:07,502
Why don't we just set up house here?

384
00:30:07,677 --> 00:30:13,843
Someone send the policeman for a pinochle deck, and we'll sweat it out.

385
00:30:14,017 --> 00:30:17,612
-He shouldn't joke about it. -What do you want me to do?

386
00:30:17,788 --> 00:30:22,555
What's the knife got to do with it? Somebody saw the kid stab his father.

387
00:30:22,726 --> 00:30:26,856
What more do we need? You guys can talk the ears off my head.

388
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:31,467
l got three garages going to pot. Let's get done and get out of here.

389
00:30:31,635 --> 00:30:35,401
The knife was important to the district attorney. He spent--

390
00:30:35,572 --> 00:30:41,943
-He's a 1 5th assistant. What's he know? -These arguments are slowing us up.

391
00:30:44,181 --> 00:30:47,582
Well, what about it? You're the only one.

392
00:30:54,925 --> 00:31:00,522
l have a proposition to make to you. l'm going to call for another vote.

393
00:31:01,331 --> 00:31:06,496
l want you 1 1 men to vote by secret written ballot.

394
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:11,607
l'll abstain. lf there are 1 1 votes for guilty, l won't stand alone.

395
00:31:11,775 --> 00:31:15,302
We'll take in a guilty verdict to the judge right now.

396
00:31:16,813 --> 00:31:21,614
But if anyone votes not guilty, we'll stay here and talk it out.

397
00:31:24,054 --> 00:31:28,218
-lf you want to try it, l'm ready. -Let's do it the hard way.

398
00:31:28,391 --> 00:31:32,157
That sounds fair. Everyone agreed? Anyone doesn't agree?

399
00:31:32,329 --> 00:31:36,129
-Here, pass these along. -ls that the right time?

400
00:32:07,664 --> 00:32:08,961
''Guilty.''

401
00:32:11,535 --> 00:32:12,797
''Guilty.''

402
00:32:14,871 --> 00:32:16,236
''Guilty.''

403
00:32:18,441 --> 00:32:19,840
''Guilty.''

404
00:32:21,077 --> 00:32:22,339
''Guilty.''

405
00:32:24,214 --> 00:32:25,511
''Guilty.''

406
00:32:27,417 --> 00:32:28,714
''Guilty.''

407
00:32:29,786 --> 00:32:31,083
''Guilty.''

408
00:32:32,122 --> 00:32:33,521
''Guilty.''

409
00:32:38,028 --> 00:32:39,552
''Not guilty.''

410
00:32:40,063 --> 00:32:41,394
''Guilty.''

411
00:32:41,565 --> 00:32:46,025
-Boy, how do you like that? -And another chap flips his wings.

412
00:32:46,203 --> 00:32:48,797
All right, who was it? l want to know.

413
00:32:48,972 --> 00:32:52,772
Excuse me. lt was a secret ballot. We all agreed on that.

414
00:32:52,943 --> 00:32:57,039
-lf the gentleman wants it secret-- -What do you mean, ''secret''?

415
00:32:57,214 --> 00:33:00,809
There are no secrets in a jury room. l know who it was.

416
00:33:00,984 --> 00:33:02,713
You really are something.

417
00:33:02,886 --> 00:33:08,586
You sit here, vote guilty, and some preacher tears your poor heart out...

418
00:33:08,758 --> 00:33:13,627
...about a kid who couldn't help being a murderer, and you change your vote.

419
00:33:13,797 --> 00:33:15,526
lf that isn't the most--

420
00:33:15,665 --> 00:33:19,123
Why don't you drop a quarter in his collection box?

421
00:33:19,302 --> 00:33:23,033
Now, just wait a minute. You can't talk to me like that.

422
00:33:23,206 --> 00:33:26,073
-Who do you think you are? -Calm down.

423
00:33:26,409 --> 00:33:28,468
He's very excitable. Sit down.

424
00:33:28,645 --> 00:33:33,639
You bet l am! We're trying to put a man in the chair where he belongs.

425
00:33:33,817 --> 00:33:36,342
He tells us fairy tales, and we listen.

426
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:38,282
Hey. Come on, huh?

427
00:33:38,455 --> 00:33:43,222
-What made you change your vote? -He didn't change his vote. l did.

428
00:33:44,027 --> 00:33:45,358
-Fine. -l knew it.

429
00:33:45,528 --> 00:33:49,533
-Would you like me to tell you why? -No, l wouldn't.

430
00:33:49,533 --> 00:33:53,697
-l'd like to make it clear anyway. -Do we have to listen to this?

431
00:33:53,871 --> 00:33:56,897
-The man wants to talk. -Thank you.

432
00:33:57,074 --> 00:34:00,407
This gentleman has been standing alone against us.

433
00:34:00,577 --> 00:34:04,809
Now he doesn't say the boy's not guilty. He just isn't sure.

434
00:34:04,982 --> 00:34:07,780
lt's not easy to stand alone against ridicule.

435
00:34:07,951 --> 00:34:12,650
So he gambled for support, and l gave it to him. l respect his motives.

436
00:34:12,823 --> 00:34:15,417
The boy on trial is probably guilty.

437
00:34:15,592 --> 00:34:19,221
But l want to hear more. Right now the vote is 1 0 to 2.

438
00:34:19,396 --> 00:34:22,763
-You have no right to leave-- -He can't hear you.

439
00:34:22,933 --> 00:34:25,595
He never will. Let's sit down.

440
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,535
Shall we continue?

441
00:34:31,708 --> 00:34:33,801
l think we ought to take a break.

442
00:34:33,977 --> 00:34:39,882
You know, one man's inside, and l think we ought to wait for him. Okay.

443
00:34:41,251 --> 00:34:43,879
Looks like we're really hung up here.

444
00:34:44,421 --> 00:34:47,720
That thing with the old man, that was unexpected.

445
00:34:48,826 --> 00:34:52,318
l wish l could figure out some way we could break it up.

446
00:34:54,031 --> 00:34:58,297
You know, in advertising-- l told you l worked in an agency?

447
00:34:58,469 --> 00:35:01,199
There are some strange people working there.

448
00:35:01,371 --> 00:35:06,900
They're not strange, l guess. They just have peculiar ways of expressing themselves.

449
00:35:07,077 --> 00:35:10,069
l suppose it's the same in your business too?

450
00:35:10,247 --> 00:35:12,738
-What do you do? -l'm a watchmaker.

451
00:35:12,916 --> 00:35:17,182
Really? l imagine the finest watchmakers come from Europe, huh?

452
00:35:17,354 --> 00:35:20,323
ln an agency when we reach a point like this--

453
00:35:20,491 --> 00:35:24,018
ln an ad agency, when a point like this is reached...

454
00:35:24,194 --> 00:35:28,722
...always some character ready with an idea, see? And it kills me....

455
00:35:28,899 --> 00:35:33,632
lt's the weirdest thing, the way they precede their idea with a phrase.

456
00:35:33,804 --> 00:35:38,537
Some account exec will get up and he'll say, ''Okay, here's an idea.

457
00:35:38,709 --> 00:35:43,442
Let's run it up the flagpole and see if anyone salutes it.''

458
00:35:43,614 --> 00:35:45,582
lt's idiotic, but it's funny.

459
00:35:45,749 --> 00:35:47,546
Hey...

460
00:35:47,718 --> 00:35:51,017
...l got a little excited back there.

461
00:35:51,221 --> 00:35:53,746
l didn't mean to get nasty.

462
00:35:53,924 --> 00:35:58,793
Glad you're not one of those that lets these emotional appeals influence him.

463
00:36:13,844 --> 00:36:16,938
l don't know what's the matter with that fan.

464
00:36:26,757 --> 00:36:31,285
-Hey, you a salesman? -l'm an architect.

465
00:36:32,863 --> 00:36:35,354
You know what the ''soft sell'' is?

466
00:36:37,935 --> 00:36:41,393
Well, you got it, believe me.

467
00:36:41,572 --> 00:36:43,904
l got a different technique.

468
00:36:44,074 --> 00:36:48,704
Laughs, drinks, jokes, tricks, you know?

469
00:36:49,046 --> 00:36:50,877
Yeah.

470
00:36:51,748 --> 00:36:54,979
Hit 'em where they live, that's my motto.

471
00:36:55,352 --> 00:36:59,584
l made 27 grand last year selling marmalade. That's not bad.

472
00:36:59,756 --> 00:37:02,623
l mean, you know, considering marmalade.

473
00:37:04,761 --> 00:37:07,559
What are you getting out of this? Kicks?

474
00:37:07,965 --> 00:37:11,924
Did somebody bump your head, and you haven't gotten over it?

475
00:37:12,102 --> 00:37:16,471
-Maybe. -You do-gooders are all alike.

476
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,542
You're always blowing your stacks over some guy that fanned.

477
00:37:22,312 --> 00:37:24,906
Well, what are you wasting our time for?

478
00:37:25,082 --> 00:37:29,951
Donate 5 dollars to the cause, and maybe it'll make you feel better.

479
00:37:32,322 --> 00:37:36,884
This kid is guilty, pal. lt's as plain as the nose on your face.

480
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,460
So why don't we stop wasting our time?

481
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:42,258
We're gonna all get sore throats.

482
00:37:42,432 --> 00:37:46,198
What difference is it if you get it here or at the ball game?

483
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:51,364
No difference, pal. No difference at all.

484
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:07,656
-Nice bunch of guys, huh? -They're about the same as anyone else.

485
00:38:07,824 --> 00:38:12,727
Boy, what a murderous day. You think it'll be much longer?

486
00:38:12,896 --> 00:38:14,557
l don't know.

487
00:38:14,731 --> 00:38:18,189
He's guilty for sure. Not a doubt in the whole world.

488
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:21,064
We should've been done already.

489
00:38:22,906 --> 00:38:27,502
l don't mind, you know. Beats working.

490
00:38:33,817 --> 00:38:38,481
-You think he's not guilty, huh? -l don't know. lt's possible.

491
00:38:38,655 --> 00:38:42,421
l don't know you, but l'm betting you've never been wronger.

492
00:38:42,592 --> 00:38:44,958
You're wasting your time.

493
00:38:45,128 --> 00:38:47,892
Supposing you were the one that was on trial?

494
00:38:48,065 --> 00:38:50,556
Well, l'm not used to supposing.

495
00:38:50,734 --> 00:38:54,226
l'm just a working man. My boss does the supposing...

496
00:38:54,404 --> 00:38:55,928
...but l'll try one.

497
00:38:57,107 --> 00:39:00,270
Supposing you talk us all out of this...

498
00:39:00,444 --> 00:39:03,811
...and the kid really did knife his father, huh?

499
00:39:12,022 --> 00:39:13,387
Ready?

500
00:39:15,459 --> 00:39:17,757
Sorry, blue eyes.

501
00:39:18,195 --> 00:39:21,255
-One of those. -Okay, let's take our seats.

502
00:39:21,431 --> 00:39:23,490
Looks like we'll be here for dinner.

503
00:39:23,667 --> 00:39:27,159
Okay, let's get down to business. Who wants to start?

504
00:39:27,337 --> 00:39:28,770
-l will. -Okay, go.

505
00:39:28,939 --> 00:39:33,376
You. The old man who lived downstairs says he heard the kid yell:

506
00:39:33,543 --> 00:39:37,502
''l'm gonna kill you.'' A second later he heard the body fall.

507
00:39:37,681 --> 00:39:40,946
He ran to the door, and he saw the kid running out.

508
00:39:41,118 --> 00:39:42,881
What does that mean to you?

509
00:39:43,053 --> 00:39:46,511
How clearly could he have heard through the ceiling?

510
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:50,649
He didn't hear it through the ceiling. The window was open.

511
00:39:50,827 --> 00:39:56,026
-lt's not that easy to identify a voice. -He identified it in court.

512
00:39:56,199 --> 00:40:00,636
Don't forget the lady across the street. She saw the boy stab his father.

513
00:40:00,804 --> 00:40:03,432
-lsn't that enough for you? -No, it isn't.

514
00:40:03,607 --> 00:40:07,065
lt's like talking into a dead phone.

515
00:40:07,244 --> 00:40:10,475
She saw the killing through the windows of a train.

516
00:40:10,647 --> 00:40:14,515
There are six cars. She saw the killing through the last two.

517
00:40:14,684 --> 00:40:18,176
She remembered insignificant details. How can you argue?

518
00:40:18,355 --> 00:40:23,486
Has anybody here any idea how long it would take an El--?

519
00:40:33,036 --> 00:40:34,731
This isn't a game.

520
00:40:39,109 --> 00:40:42,010
Did you see him? The nerve!

521
00:40:42,179 --> 00:40:44,374
-Listen-- -The absolute nerve.

522
00:40:44,548 --> 00:40:47,745
-All right, forget it. -This isn't a game?

523
00:40:47,918 --> 00:40:50,409
-Calm down. -Who does he think he is?

524
00:40:50,587 --> 00:40:51,849
Forget it now.

525
00:40:52,022 --> 00:40:57,460
Has anybody any idea how long it takes an elevated train to pass a given point?

526
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:01,658
-l wouldn't have the slightest idea. -What do you think?

527
00:41:01,831 --> 00:41:04,527
l don't know. Maybe 1 0, 1 2 seconds?

528
00:41:04,701 --> 00:41:06,362
That's good. Anyone else?

529
00:41:06,536 --> 00:41:09,164
-Sounds right. -Why the guessing game?

530
00:41:09,339 --> 00:41:11,102
-And you? -1 0 seconds.

531
00:41:11,274 --> 00:41:14,334
All right, say 1 0 seconds. What are you getting at?

532
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:18,310
lt takes a six-car El train 1 0 seconds to pass a point.

533
00:41:18,481 --> 00:41:22,645
Say the point is the window of the room where the killing took place.

534
00:41:22,819 --> 00:41:25,982
You can reach out and almost touch the tracks.

535
00:41:26,155 --> 00:41:29,955
Let me ask you this: Has anyone ever lived near the tracks?

536
00:41:30,126 --> 00:41:33,857
l just painted an apartment that overlooked an El line.

537
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,861
-What's it like? -What do you mean?

538
00:41:36,032 --> 00:41:37,863
-Noisy? -Oh, brother!

539
00:41:38,034 --> 00:41:41,970
-Don't matter, we're all punchy. -l lived near the El line once.

540
00:41:42,138 --> 00:41:45,073
When a train passes, the noise is unbearable.

541
00:41:45,241 --> 00:41:48,904
-You can hardly hear yourself think. -Get to the point.

542
00:41:49,078 --> 00:41:50,545
l will. Just a minute.

543
00:41:50,713 --> 00:41:54,205
Let's take two testimonies and put them together.

544
00:41:54,384 --> 00:41:58,150
First, the old man in the apartment downstairs.

545
00:41:58,321 --> 00:42:01,620
He heard the boy say, ''l'm going to kill you''...

546
00:42:01,791 --> 00:42:04,988
...and a second later heard a body hit the floor.

547
00:42:05,161 --> 00:42:07,061
-That's right. -Second...

548
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:11,633
...the woman swore positively she looked out of the window...

549
00:42:11,801 --> 00:42:16,067
...and saw the killing through the last two cars of the train.

550
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:18,833
-What are you giving us? -Just a minute.

551
00:42:19,008 --> 00:42:24,105
We've agreed that it takes 1 0 seconds for a train to pass a given point.

552
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,511
Since she saw the killing through the last two cars...

553
00:42:27,683 --> 00:42:32,746
...we can assume that the body hit the floor just as the train went by.

554
00:42:32,922 --> 00:42:37,188
Therefore the train had been roaring by the old man's window...

555
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,761
...a full 1 0 seconds before the body hit the floor.

556
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:43,763
According to his testimony, ''l'm gonna kill you''...

557
00:42:43,933 --> 00:42:46,128
...body hits the floor a second later...

558
00:42:46,302 --> 00:42:50,398
...he would have had to hear the boy with the El roaring past.

559
00:42:50,573 --> 00:42:53,474
-He couldn't have heard it. -Of course he did.

560
00:42:53,643 --> 00:42:56,771
-You think so? -He yelled at the top of his voice.

561
00:42:56,946 --> 00:43:00,143
He couldn't have identified the voice with the El passing.

562
00:43:00,316 --> 00:43:03,149
You're talking about seconds. Nobody's that accurate.

563
00:43:03,319 --> 00:43:08,586
l think testimony that could put a boy in the chair should be that accurate.

564
00:43:09,926 --> 00:43:14,158
-l don't think he heard it. -Maybe he didn't, with all that noise.

565
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:16,161
What are you talking about?

566
00:43:16,332 --> 00:43:20,393
-lt stands to reason he couldn't hear. -Why should he lie?

567
00:43:20,903 --> 00:43:22,530
Attention, maybe.

568
00:43:22,705 --> 00:43:25,868
You come up with these bright sayings. Send them to a paper.

569
00:43:26,042 --> 00:43:30,809
-They pay $3 apiece. -What are you talking to him like that for?

570
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:34,746
A guy talks like that to an old man ought to get stepped on.

571
00:43:34,917 --> 00:43:37,351
You ought to have more respect, mister.

572
00:43:37,553 --> 00:43:42,923
You say stuff like that to him again, l'm gonna lay you out.

573
00:43:52,235 --> 00:43:55,864
Now, you go ahead. You say anything you like.

574
00:43:56,038 --> 00:43:59,007
Why do you think the old man might lie?

575
00:43:59,175 --> 00:44:03,134
lt was just that l looked at him for a very long time.

576
00:44:03,312 --> 00:44:06,475
Seemed the jacket was split under the shoulder.

577
00:44:06,649 --> 00:44:11,382
Or did you notice that? l mean, to come to court like that.

578
00:44:13,789 --> 00:44:17,520
He was a very old man in a torn jacket.

579
00:44:17,693 --> 00:44:21,094
And he walked very slowly to the stand.

580
00:44:21,264 --> 00:44:25,223
He was dragging his left leg and trying to hide it...

581
00:44:25,401 --> 00:44:28,029
...'cause he was ashamed.

582
00:44:28,204 --> 00:44:32,231
l think l know this man better than anyone here.

583
00:44:32,408 --> 00:44:36,811
This is a quiet, frightened, insignificant old man...

584
00:44:36,979 --> 00:44:40,471
...who has been nothing all his life.

585
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:45,587
Who's never had recognition or his name in the newspapers.

586
00:44:45,755 --> 00:44:50,021
Nobody knows him. Nobody quotes him.

587
00:44:50,192 --> 00:44:54,754
Nobody seeks his advice after 75 years.

588
00:44:54,931 --> 00:44:59,425
Gentlemen, that's a very sad thing, to mean nothing.

589
00:44:59,602 --> 00:45:02,093
A man like this needs to be quoted.

590
00:45:02,271 --> 00:45:08,642
To be listened to. To be quoted just once, very important to him.

591
00:45:08,811 --> 00:45:11,644
lt would be so hard for him to recede into--

592
00:45:11,814 --> 00:45:15,682
You're telling us he'd lie just so he could be important once?

593
00:45:15,851 --> 00:45:18,718
No. He wouldn't really lie.

594
00:45:18,888 --> 00:45:24,588
Maybe he made himself believe he heard those words and recogniZed the boy.

595
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,024
That's a fantastic story.

596
00:45:27,196 --> 00:45:31,292
How can you make up a thing like that? What do you know about it?

597
00:45:39,108 --> 00:45:41,133
Does anybody want a cough drop?

598
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:43,335
-No, thanks. -l'll take one.

599
00:45:43,512 --> 00:45:47,107
l still don't see how anybody can think he's not guilty.

600
00:45:47,283 --> 00:45:51,310
There's something else l'd like to talk about for a minute.

601
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:55,116
We proved he couldn't hear the boy say, ''l'm gonna kill you.''

602
00:45:55,291 --> 00:45:59,284
-You didn't prove it at all. -Supposing he really did hear it.

603
00:45:59,462 --> 00:46:03,296
This phrase, how many times have all of us used it? Thousands.

604
00:46:03,466 --> 00:46:08,494
-You didn't prove it at all. -Supposing he really did hear it.

605
00:46:08,671 --> 00:46:12,266
-lt doesn't mean we're gonna-- -What are you trying to do?

606
00:46:12,441 --> 00:46:16,969
The phrase was, ''l'm gonna kill you.'' Don't tell me he didn't mean it.

607
00:46:17,146 --> 00:46:20,081
Anybody says that the way he did, they mean it.

608
00:46:20,249 --> 00:46:21,841
Gee, now, l don't know.

609
00:46:22,018 --> 00:46:25,385
l was arguing with a guy l work with a few weeks ago.

610
00:46:25,554 --> 00:46:28,148
He called me an idiot, so l yelled at him.

611
00:46:28,324 --> 00:46:31,487
He's trying to make you believe things that aren't so.

612
00:46:31,661 --> 00:46:33,322
Kid said he'd kill him and did.

613
00:46:33,496 --> 00:46:38,160
You think the boy would shout that so the whole neighborhood could hear?

614
00:46:38,334 --> 00:46:40,165
He's much too bright.

615
00:46:40,336 --> 00:46:45,035
Bright? He's a common, ignorant slob. He don't even speak good English.

616
00:46:45,207 --> 00:46:48,768
He doesn't even speak good English.

617
00:46:50,379 --> 00:46:54,748
Mr. Foreman, l'd like to change my vote to not guilty.

618
00:46:54,917 --> 00:46:56,885
-You what? -You heard me.

619
00:46:57,053 --> 00:47:00,489
-Are you sure? -Yeah, l'm sure.

620
00:47:00,656 --> 00:47:03,181
9 to 3, favor of guilty.

621
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:07,022
Well, if this isn't the living end, huh?

622
00:47:09,932 --> 00:47:13,390
What are you basing it on, stories this guy made up?

623
00:47:13,569 --> 00:47:17,630
You should write for a detective magaZine, you'd make a fortune.

624
00:47:17,807 --> 00:47:21,368
The kid's own lawyer knew he didn't stand a chance.

625
00:47:21,544 --> 00:47:24,877
Right from the beginning, his own lawyer knew.

626
00:47:25,047 --> 00:47:29,416
Boy, oh, boy. l'm telling you, this guy here is really something.

627
00:47:29,585 --> 00:47:32,315
The kid had a lawyer. He presented his case.

628
00:47:32,488 --> 00:47:36,083
-How come you got so much to say? -Lawyers aren't infallible.

629
00:47:36,258 --> 00:47:39,750
-He was court appointed. -What's that supposed to mean?

630
00:47:39,929 --> 00:47:42,420
lt could mean he didn't want the case...

631
00:47:42,598 --> 00:47:45,829
...or he resented it. The case brings him nothing.

632
00:47:46,001 --> 00:47:49,232
No money, no glory, not even much chance of winning.

633
00:47:49,405 --> 00:47:52,374
Not a very promising situation for a young lawyer.

634
00:47:52,541 --> 00:47:57,342
He'd really have to believe in his client to put up a case. He didn't.

635
00:47:57,513 --> 00:48:02,678
Of course he didn't. Who the heck could?

636
00:48:02,852 --> 00:48:05,616
Maybe some guy's mother or somebody....

637
00:48:05,788 --> 00:48:08,916
Aw, look, will you look at the time? Come on.

638
00:48:09,091 --> 00:48:13,027
Pardon me. l have made some notes here...

639
00:48:13,195 --> 00:48:15,925
...and l would like, please, to say something.

640
00:48:16,098 --> 00:48:18,498
l have been listening very carefully...

641
00:48:18,667 --> 00:48:22,660
...and it seems that this man has some very good points to make.

642
00:48:22,838 --> 00:48:27,832
From what was presented at the trial, the boy looks guilty on the surface.

643
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:31,446
-But maybe if we go deeper--? -Come on, will you?

644
00:48:31,614 --> 00:48:33,844
There's a question l'd like to ask.

645
00:48:34,016 --> 00:48:37,281
Let us assume that the boy did commit the murder.

646
00:48:37,453 --> 00:48:40,718
Now this happened at 1 0 minutes after 1 2.

647
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:43,256
Now, how was he caught by the police?

648
00:48:43,425 --> 00:48:47,794
He came back home at 3:00 or so...

649
00:48:47,963 --> 00:48:51,592
...and he was captured by two detectives in his house.

650
00:48:51,767 --> 00:48:56,261
Now, my question is, if he really had killed his father...

651
00:48:56,438 --> 00:48:59,669
...why did he come back home three hours later?

652
00:48:59,842 --> 00:49:02,606
Wouldn't he be afraid of being caught?

653
00:49:02,778 --> 00:49:06,942
He came for his knife. lt's not nice to leave knives sticking in chests.

654
00:49:07,116 --> 00:49:09,778
Yeah, especially relatives'.

655
00:49:10,019 --> 00:49:12,222
l don't see anything funny. He knew the knife could be...

656
00:49:12,222 --> 00:49:13,689
l don't see anything funny. He knew the knife could be...

657
00:49:13,856 --> 00:49:17,986
...identified as his. He had to get it before the police did.

658
00:49:18,161 --> 00:49:23,098
lf he knew it could be identified, why did he leave it in the first place?

659
00:49:23,266 --> 00:49:28,329
We can assume the boy ran out in a panic after having killed his father.

660
00:49:28,504 --> 00:49:31,769
When he calmed down, he realiZed he'd left his knife.

661
00:49:31,941 --> 00:49:34,705
This depends on your definition of panic.

662
00:49:34,877 --> 00:49:39,576
He'd have had to be calm enough to leave no fingerprints on the knife.

663
00:49:39,749 --> 00:49:43,742
Now, where did this panic start and where did it end?

664
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,684
You voted guilty. What side are you on?

665
00:49:46,856 --> 00:49:51,725
l don't have to be loyal to one side or the other. l'm just asking questions.

666
00:49:51,894 --> 00:49:55,022
This is just off the top of my head, but....

667
00:49:55,198 --> 00:49:59,532
lf l were him and l'd done the stabbing, l'd go back for the knife.

668
00:49:59,702 --> 00:50:04,969
He figured nobody saw him leave and the body wouldn't be found till the next day.

669
00:50:05,141 --> 00:50:06,768
lt was the middle of the night.

670
00:50:06,943 --> 00:50:11,505
-He figured nobody would find the body. -Pardon. This is my whole point.

671
00:50:11,681 --> 00:50:15,378
The woman testified that the moment after the killing--

672
00:50:15,551 --> 00:50:17,781
A moment after the train passed...

673
00:50:17,954 --> 00:50:21,117
...she screamed and went to telephone the police.

674
00:50:21,291 --> 00:50:24,624
Now, the boy certainly must have heard the scream.

675
00:50:24,794 --> 00:50:28,195
So he knew that somebody saw something.

676
00:50:28,364 --> 00:50:31,060
l don't think he would have gone back.

677
00:50:31,234 --> 00:50:35,568
ln his panic, he may not have heard the scream. Perhaps it wasn't loud.

678
00:50:35,738 --> 00:50:39,139
Or he may not have connected the scream with his act.

679
00:50:39,309 --> 00:50:42,107
Screams were commonplace in his neighborhood.

680
00:50:42,278 --> 00:50:44,712
-There's your answer. -Maybe.

681
00:50:44,881 --> 00:50:48,339
Maybe he did kill his father, didn't hear the scream...

682
00:50:48,518 --> 00:50:51,180
...ran out in a panic, calmed down later...

683
00:50:51,354 --> 00:50:54,289
...and came to get the knife, risking capture.

684
00:50:54,457 --> 00:50:57,358
Maybe that happened, but maybe it didn't.

685
00:50:57,527 --> 00:51:01,463
There's enough doubt that we can wonder whether he was there.

686
00:51:01,631 --> 00:51:05,032
What are you talking about? The old man saw him run.

687
00:51:05,201 --> 00:51:07,226
He's twisting the facts.

688
00:51:07,403 --> 00:51:10,804
Did or didn't the old man see the kid at 1 2:1 0?

689
00:51:10,973 --> 00:51:13,771
-Well, did or didn't he? -He says he did.

690
00:51:13,943 --> 00:51:17,401
-Says he did? -Look, witnesses can make mistakes.

691
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:21,107
Sure, when you want them to, and when he wants them to.

692
00:51:21,284 --> 00:51:24,845
-Keep the yelling down. -Maybe what we need is yelling.

693
00:51:25,021 --> 00:51:28,787
These guys keep going off. Did hear the scream, didn't.

694
00:51:28,958 --> 00:51:32,394
You people are talking only about the little details.

695
00:51:32,562 --> 00:51:34,792
You're forgetting the important stuff.

696
00:51:34,964 --> 00:51:36,989
-l want another vote. -l'm talking.

697
00:51:37,166 --> 00:51:42,126
There's another vote called for. Now let's take our seats.

698
00:51:44,707 --> 00:51:47,335
l never saw so much time spent on nothing.

699
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:50,104
lt only takes a second.

700
00:51:50,279 --> 00:51:53,737
The fastest way is to find out who's voting not guilty.

701
00:51:53,916 --> 00:51:57,249
All those voting not guilty, raise your hands.

702
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:01,249
Still the same. One, two, three, not guilty. Nine, guilties.

703
00:52:01,424 --> 00:52:04,723
l tell you, we can yackety-yak till next Tuesday.

704
00:52:04,894 --> 00:52:06,521
Where's it all getting us?

705
00:52:06,696 --> 00:52:10,029
Pardon. l vote not guilty.

706
00:52:12,135 --> 00:52:15,832
What's he talking about? We're all going craZy in here.

707
00:52:16,005 --> 00:52:19,771
The kid is guilty. Why don't you listen to the facts?

708
00:52:19,942 --> 00:52:22,035
This is getting to be a joke.

709
00:52:22,211 --> 00:52:25,442
The vote is 8 to 4, favor of guilty.

710
00:52:25,615 --> 00:52:29,483
What is this, ''Love Your Underprivileged Brother Week''?

711
00:52:29,652 --> 00:52:33,281
Tell me why you changed your vote. Give me reasons.

712
00:52:33,456 --> 00:52:37,916
l don't have to defend my decision. There's reasonable doubt in my mind.

713
00:52:38,094 --> 00:52:41,120
What doubt? That's just words. Look at this.

714
00:52:41,297 --> 00:52:46,132
The kid you decided isn't guilty was seen ramming this into his father.

715
00:52:46,302 --> 00:52:51,433
-What about it, Mr. Reasonable Doubt? -That's not the knife. Remember?

716
00:52:51,607 --> 00:52:53,302
Brilliant.

717
00:52:53,476 --> 00:52:55,569
l tell you, this is the craZiest.

718
00:52:55,745 --> 00:53:00,705
What are we supposed to believe? You're pulling stories out of thin air.

719
00:53:00,983 --> 00:53:04,612
This guy, if he's ringside at the Dempsey-Firpo fight...

720
00:53:04,787 --> 00:53:07,119
...he'd be trying to tell you that....

721
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:11,693
What about the old man? We're to believe he didn't run to his door...

722
00:53:11,861 --> 00:53:15,194
...and see the kid leave 1 5 seconds after the killing?

723
00:53:15,364 --> 00:53:18,026
He's just saying so to be important, right?

724
00:53:18,201 --> 00:53:20,362
-What's the point? -Hold it.

725
00:53:20,536 --> 00:53:25,166
The Baltimore rooter is heard from. And pop-ups are falling for base hits.

726
00:53:25,341 --> 00:53:28,139
Now, did the old man say he ran to the door?

727
00:53:28,311 --> 00:53:31,371
Ran, walked, what's the difference? He got there.

728
00:53:31,547 --> 00:53:34,607
-Wait a sec-- -He said he ran. l think he did.

729
00:53:34,784 --> 00:53:37,378
l don't see how he could have run.

730
00:53:37,553 --> 00:53:40,351
He said he went from his bedroom to the door.

731
00:53:40,523 --> 00:53:42,684
-Where was the bedroom? -Down the hall.

732
00:53:42,859 --> 00:53:46,317
You remember everything, don't you remember that?

733
00:53:46,496 --> 00:53:49,056
No. l'd like to see a diagram of the apartment.

734
00:53:49,232 --> 00:53:51,894
Why don't we have them run the trial again?

735
00:53:52,068 --> 00:53:54,127
You're the only one wants to see exhibits.

736
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:57,295
-l wanna see it too. -And l wanna stop wasting time.

737
00:53:57,473 --> 00:54:00,465
lf we're gonna wade through the nonsense about the body--

738
00:54:00,643 --> 00:54:05,046
We're not, but l'd like to find out if an old man whose foot drags...

739
00:54:05,214 --> 00:54:09,173
...could get from his bed to his front door in 1 5 seconds.

740
00:54:09,352 --> 00:54:10,751
-Twenty. -He said 1 5.

741
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,184
He said 20. What are you trying to distort?

742
00:54:13,356 --> 00:54:14,618
He said 1 5.

743
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:17,987
How does he know how long 1 5 seconds is?

744
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,492
He said 1 5 seconds. He was positive.

745
00:54:20,663 --> 00:54:23,325
He was old. Half the time, he was confused.

746
00:54:23,499 --> 00:54:26,093
How could he be positive about anything?

747
00:54:34,141 --> 00:54:38,134
l don't see what you're going to prove. The man saw the boy.

748
00:54:38,345 --> 00:54:40,370
Let's see if the details bear him out.

749
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:45,017
He said he heard footsteps, upstairs, running toward the front door.

750
00:54:45,218 --> 00:54:48,346
Heard the door open, the footsteps start down.

751
00:54:48,555 --> 00:54:52,889
He got to his door and swore it couldn't be more than 1 5 seconds.

752
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:55,255
-The killer began running-- -He didn't.

753
00:54:55,429 --> 00:54:56,987
The old man said he did.

754
00:54:57,164 --> 00:55:00,429
You ought to be at that hairsplitter's convention.

755
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,091
Why don't you stop making smart remarks?

756
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:05,295
My friend, for your $3 a day--

757
00:55:05,472 --> 00:55:07,838
Now that you've got that, what about it?

758
00:55:08,008 --> 00:55:09,703
Here's where the killing took place.

759
00:55:09,876 --> 00:55:13,505
The old man's apartment was beneath it and exactly the same.

760
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,649
Here are the tracks, living room, bathroom.

761
00:55:16,817 --> 00:55:21,117
Here's the hall. Here's the stairs. The old man was in this bedroom.

762
00:55:21,288 --> 00:55:23,984
He crossed to the door, walked down the hall...

763
00:55:24,157 --> 00:55:28,025
...opened the door in time to see the boy running down the stairs.

764
00:55:28,195 --> 00:55:30,425
That's the story for the 1 9th time.

765
00:55:30,597 --> 00:55:32,997
1 5 seconds after the body hit the floor.

766
00:55:33,166 --> 00:55:36,101
-Correct. -Now, let's see, it was....

767
00:55:36,269 --> 00:55:40,205
lt's 1 2 feet from the bed to the door. The hall is 43 feet.

768
00:55:40,373 --> 00:55:43,467
He would have had to walk 1 2 feet, open the door...

769
00:55:43,643 --> 00:55:47,272
...walk 43 feet down and open the front door in 1 5 seconds.

770
00:55:47,447 --> 00:55:49,415
-Do you think he could have done it? -Sure.

771
00:55:49,583 --> 00:55:52,484
He can walk only slowly. They had to help him.

772
00:55:52,652 --> 00:55:54,381
You make it sound like a long walk.

773
00:55:54,554 --> 00:55:57,955
For an old man who had a stroke, it is a long walk.

774
00:55:58,125 --> 00:56:00,491
-What are you doing? -l'm gonna try it.

775
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:03,652
What? Why didn't his lawyer bring it up?

776
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:06,958
-Maybe he didn't think of it. -What do you mean?

777
00:56:07,134 --> 00:56:08,726
-lt's obvious. -Did you think of it?

778
00:56:08,902 --> 00:56:12,133
He didn't bring it up, because it would hurt his case.

779
00:56:12,305 --> 00:56:13,294
What do you think of that?

780
00:56:13,473 --> 00:56:17,273
He didn't bring it up, because it would have meant bullying an old man.

781
00:56:17,444 --> 00:56:20,675
That doesn't sit well with a jury. Lawyers avoid it.

782
00:56:20,847 --> 00:56:23,372
-What kind of bum is he? -That's what l've been asking.

783
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:25,074
Pass me that chair.

784
00:56:25,252 --> 00:56:28,221
Those chairs are the bed. l paced off 1 2 feet.

785
00:56:28,388 --> 00:56:32,654
-This will be the bedroom door. -You can't re-create a thing like that.

786
00:56:32,826 --> 00:56:37,229
-l'd like to see it. -l'll pace to that wall and back again.

787
00:56:37,998 --> 00:56:41,297
What are you wasting everybody's time in here for?

788
00:56:41,468 --> 00:56:46,269
Look, according to you, it'll only take 1 5 seconds. Now, we can spare that.

789
00:56:48,175 --> 00:56:50,336
Come on, knock it off.

790
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:55,004
Okay. Okay, Killer. Yeah.

791
00:56:58,051 --> 00:57:00,110
Stand there and mark the door.

792
00:57:00,387 --> 00:57:02,617
lt was chain-locked, remember?

793
00:57:02,789 --> 00:57:04,814
-Got a watch with a second hand? -l have.

794
00:57:04,991 --> 00:57:09,394
You want me to start, stamp your foot. You can time me from there.

795
00:57:09,563 --> 00:57:13,192
-What are we gonna do, play charades? -What are we waiting for?

796
00:57:13,366 --> 00:57:16,358
l want to wait until the second hand reaches 60.

797
00:57:16,536 --> 00:57:18,333
Come on.

798
00:57:24,477 --> 00:57:28,709
Come on. Speed it up. He could walk twice as fast as that.

799
00:57:28,882 --> 00:57:32,113
You want me to walk faster than that? l will.

800
00:57:48,301 --> 00:57:51,498
-Lock. Door. Stop. -Right.

801
00:57:51,671 --> 00:57:56,267
-What's the time? -Exactly 41 seconds.

802
00:57:56,443 --> 00:57:58,308
-41 ? -Here's what l think happened.

803
00:57:58,478 --> 00:58:01,345
The old man heard the fight hours earlier.

804
00:58:01,514 --> 00:58:04,244
Then in bed, he heard a body hit the floor...

805
00:58:04,417 --> 00:58:07,853
...heard the scream. Got to his door as fast as he could...

806
00:58:08,021 --> 00:58:10,421
...heard somebody and assumed it was the boy.

807
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:13,650
-l think that's possible. -Assumed?

808
00:58:15,128 --> 00:58:21,067
l've seen all kinds of dishonesty, but this little display takes the cake.

809
00:58:21,234 --> 00:58:26,035
You come in here with your hearts bleeding about slum kids and injustice.

810
00:58:26,206 --> 00:58:30,472
You listen to some fairy tales. You get through to these old ladies.

811
00:58:30,644 --> 00:58:33,442
You're not getting through me. l've had enough.

812
00:58:33,613 --> 00:58:36,776
What's the matter with you? You know he's guilty!

813
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:40,010
You're letting him slip through our fingers.

814
00:58:40,186 --> 00:58:43,747
-Are you his executioner? -l'm one of them.

815
00:58:45,225 --> 00:58:49,389
-And you'd like to pull the switch. -For this kid, you bet l would.

816
00:58:49,562 --> 00:58:53,430
l feel sorry for you. What it must feel like to want to pull the switch.

817
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:57,502
Since you walked in, you've been acting like a public avenger.

818
00:58:57,671 --> 00:59:01,903
You want to see this boy die because you personally want it.

819
00:59:02,075 --> 00:59:04,168
You're a sadist.

820
00:59:04,644 --> 00:59:08,080
Let me go! l'll kill him. l'll kill him!

821
00:59:08,248 --> 00:59:11,706
You don't really mean you'll kill me, do you?

822
00:59:17,891 --> 00:59:20,451
Anything wrong? l heard some noise.

823
00:59:20,627 --> 00:59:24,620
No. Everything's all right. Just a friendly little argument.

824
00:59:24,798 --> 00:59:28,734
We're through with that diagram. You can take it if you want.

825
00:59:28,902 --> 00:59:31,769
Here you are. Thank you.

826
00:59:36,276 --> 00:59:38,744
What are you looking at?

827
00:59:58,798 --> 01:00:01,790
-l suppose somebody has to start. -l beg pardon.

828
01:00:01,968 --> 01:00:04,960
''l beg pardon''? What are you so polite about?

829
01:00:05,138 --> 01:00:10,075
For the same reason you're not. lt's the way l was brought up.

830
01:00:11,211 --> 01:00:15,045
This fighting, that's not why we are here, to fight.

831
01:00:15,215 --> 01:00:18,707
We have a responsibility.

832
01:00:18,885 --> 01:00:23,345
This, l have always thought, is a remarkable thing about democracy.

833
01:00:23,523 --> 01:00:26,492
That we are--

834
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:30,220
What is the word? Notified.

835
01:00:30,397 --> 01:00:34,060
That we are notified by mail to come down to this place...

836
01:00:34,234 --> 01:00:40,366
...to decide on the guilt or innocence of a man we have never heard of before.

837
01:00:41,007 --> 01:00:46,274
We have nothing to gain or lose by our verdict.

838
01:00:46,446 --> 01:00:50,678
This is one of the reasons why we are strong.

839
01:00:50,884 --> 01:00:54,786
We should not make it a personal thing.

840
01:00:55,121 --> 01:00:56,884
Thank you.

841
01:00:58,224 --> 01:01:00,249
lf nobody has an idea, l might.

842
01:01:00,427 --> 01:01:04,386
Let's throw it out on the stoop and see if the cat licks it up.

843
01:01:04,564 --> 01:01:08,466
-''The cat licks it up''? -Yeah.

844
01:01:11,638 --> 01:01:14,040
Look how dark it's getting.

845
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:17,032
l bet we're gonna have a storm now.

846
01:01:18,111 --> 01:01:21,376
Boy, oh, boy, it's really hot.

847
01:01:22,181 --> 01:01:26,117
Pardon me, but don't you ever sweat?

848
01:01:26,286 --> 01:01:28,379
No, l don't.

849
01:01:28,688 --> 01:01:33,216
Listen, l was wondering if...

850
01:01:33,393 --> 01:01:36,419
...maybe we should take another vote.

851
01:01:36,596 --> 01:01:41,659
Great. Maybe we can follow this one up with a little dancing and refreshments.

852
01:01:41,834 --> 01:01:44,769
-Mr. Foreman? -Well, that's okay with me.

853
01:01:44,938 --> 01:01:46,769
Anyone doesn't want to vote?

854
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:50,068
-Hey, come on. -What? l'm sorry.

855
01:01:50,243 --> 01:01:53,679
We ought to have an open ballot. Call out our votes.

856
01:01:53,846 --> 01:01:57,373
-Let's see who stands where. -That sounds fair to me.

857
01:01:57,550 --> 01:01:59,882
Anyone object?

858
01:02:01,287 --> 01:02:05,189
Okay, l'll call off your jury numbers. One?

859
01:02:05,358 --> 01:02:09,590
That's me. l vote guilty. Two?

860
01:02:09,963 --> 01:02:11,260
Not guilty.

861
01:02:11,798 --> 01:02:13,095
Number three?

862
01:02:13,666 --> 01:02:15,258
Guilty.

863
01:02:15,568 --> 01:02:17,661
Number four?

864
01:02:18,972 --> 01:02:20,269
Guilty.

865
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:21,839
Number five?

866
01:02:22,342 --> 01:02:24,310
Not guilty.

867
01:02:24,477 --> 01:02:26,274
Number six?

868
01:02:26,446 --> 01:02:27,743
Not guilty.

869
01:02:28,648 --> 01:02:30,411
Number seven?

870
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:32,217
Guilty.

871
01:02:32,385 --> 01:02:34,182
Number eight?

872
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:36,488
Not guilty.

873
01:02:37,123 --> 01:02:38,488
Number nine?

874
01:02:38,691 --> 01:02:40,181
Not guilty.

875
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:41,622
Number 1 0?

876
01:02:41,794 --> 01:02:43,352
Guilty.

877
01:02:44,364 --> 01:02:46,332
Number 1 1 ?

878
01:02:46,499 --> 01:02:48,399
Not guilty.

879
01:02:48,568 --> 01:02:49,865
Number 1 2?

880
01:02:50,903 --> 01:02:53,167
Number 1 2?

881
01:02:53,339 --> 01:02:54,704
Guilty.

882
01:03:00,813 --> 01:03:02,781
The vote is now 6 to 6.

883
01:03:02,949 --> 01:03:07,613
Yeah, and we go into extra innings here, huh?

884
01:03:08,021 --> 01:03:09,386
Six to six.

885
01:03:09,555 --> 01:03:12,956
Some of you people in here must be out of your minds.

886
01:03:13,126 --> 01:03:14,593
A kid like that.

887
01:03:14,761 --> 01:03:18,162
l don't think the kind of boy he is has anything to do with it.

888
01:03:18,331 --> 01:03:21,266
-The facts determine the case. -Don't give me that.

889
01:03:21,434 --> 01:03:24,369
l'm tired of facts. You can twist them any way.

890
01:03:24,537 --> 01:03:27,870
That's the point this gentleman has been making.

891
01:03:28,041 --> 01:03:31,568
l mean, you keep shouting at the top of your lungs!

892
01:03:32,078 --> 01:03:37,175
l'd like to be a few years younger. That man gets on my....

893
01:03:39,452 --> 01:03:42,012
-lt's hot in here. -Want a drink of water?

894
01:03:42,188 --> 01:03:45,988
No. No, thanks. Thanks.

895
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,563
lt's gonna rain.

896
01:03:55,735 --> 01:03:58,727
Well, how did you figure that out, Killer?

897
01:03:59,172 --> 01:04:01,140
How come you changed your vote?

898
01:04:01,307 --> 01:04:03,798
lt seemed to me there was room for doubt.

899
01:04:03,976 --> 01:04:07,139
-You haven't got a leg to stand on. -l don't feel that way.

900
01:04:07,313 --> 01:04:10,305
-A lot of details never came out. -Well, good luck.

901
01:04:10,483 --> 01:04:16,012
Come on. You're like everybody else. You think too much, you get mixed-up.

902
01:04:16,189 --> 01:04:20,216
-You know what l mean? -l don't think you have any right--

903
01:04:20,393 --> 01:04:22,486
Loudmouth.

904
01:05:15,348 --> 01:05:18,545
Look at that come down, will you?

905
01:05:19,252 --> 01:05:24,212
You know, this reminds me of a storm we had last....

906
01:05:25,391 --> 01:05:28,758
Was that November? l don't know, something.

907
01:05:28,928 --> 01:05:32,955
lt was quite a storm we had. lt was in the middle of a game.

908
01:05:33,266 --> 01:05:36,861
We were behind, 7 to 6, but we'd started to move the ball.

909
01:05:37,036 --> 01:05:44,306
Made a real tackle there. Started to cut right, slash right in and cut.

910
01:05:45,545 --> 01:05:48,605
We had this kid, Slattery.

911
01:05:48,948 --> 01:05:52,247
He was a real ox, a real ox.

912
01:05:52,418 --> 01:05:55,012
l wish l had another one just like him.

913
01:05:55,188 --> 01:05:59,716
l'm the assistant head coach at the Andrew J. McCorkle High School.

914
01:05:59,892 --> 01:06:01,723
Yeah, that's out in Queens.

915
01:06:01,894 --> 01:06:06,524
And anyway, we're starting to move along real nice.

916
01:06:06,699 --> 01:06:11,102
And, you know, their whole line is just coming apart.

917
01:06:11,337 --> 01:06:14,898
lt starts to come down cats and dogs, just like this.

918
01:06:15,074 --> 01:06:18,908
Just, whoosh, right down.

919
01:06:19,078 --> 01:06:22,309
Well, that was murder, you know?

920
01:06:22,481 --> 01:06:27,817
l swear, l nearly bawled. You just couldn't go nowhere.

921
01:06:28,754 --> 01:06:30,016
Yeah.

922
01:06:45,738 --> 01:06:49,105
Hey, what is it with this fan here? How come...?

923
01:06:56,182 --> 01:06:57,911
Hey, huh?

924
01:06:59,151 --> 01:07:01,949
Must have been on the switch with the lights.

925
01:07:02,121 --> 01:07:05,648
Well, things are looking up here, huh?

926
01:07:05,891 --> 01:07:07,449
Yeah.

927
01:07:12,198 --> 01:07:15,167
Boy, it's better.

928
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:24,567
Hey, two points.

929
01:07:28,281 --> 01:07:31,148
Any of you guys ever go to the Garden?

930
01:07:32,485 --> 01:07:35,352
That's a damned stupid thing to do.

931
01:07:35,655 --> 01:07:38,351
l'm sorry, l....

932
01:07:38,724 --> 01:07:39,986
You know?

933
01:07:41,827 --> 01:07:43,795
Pardon me.

934
01:07:44,397 --> 01:07:49,096
Well, how do you like it? Even-steven. Pretty surprising, isn't it?

935
01:07:49,268 --> 01:07:50,826
Yes.

936
01:07:52,505 --> 01:07:55,963
Say, that business when that tall guy, what's his name...

937
01:07:56,142 --> 01:08:00,135
...was trying to bait me, now, that doesn't prove anything.

938
01:08:00,313 --> 01:08:05,546
Where does he come off calling me a public avenger, sadist and everything?

939
01:08:05,718 --> 01:08:08,983
Anyone in his right mind would blow his stack.

940
01:08:09,155 --> 01:08:11,350
He was just trying to bait me.

941
01:08:11,524 --> 01:08:14,220
He did an excellent job.

942
01:08:16,295 --> 01:08:20,891
l tell you, we're going nowhere here. l'm ready to declare a hung jury.

943
01:08:21,067 --> 01:08:24,161
-There's no point in going on. -l go for that too.

944
01:08:24,337 --> 01:08:27,170
Let the kid take his chances with 1 2 other guys.

945
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:30,366
l don't think the judge will accept a hung jury.

946
01:08:30,543 --> 01:08:33,569
-Well, let's find out. -l'm not in favor of that.

947
01:08:33,746 --> 01:08:37,045
This kid wouldn't stand a chance with another jury.

948
01:08:37,216 --> 01:08:39,980
We're hung. Nobody's gonna change his vote.

949
01:08:40,152 --> 01:08:43,644
-You still don't think there's doubt? -No, l don't.

950
01:08:43,823 --> 01:08:48,385
Pardon. Maybe you don't fully understand the term ''reasonable doubt.''

951
01:08:49,028 --> 01:08:52,020
What do you mean l don't understand?

952
01:08:52,198 --> 01:08:55,565
Boy, how do you like this guy? They're all alike.

953
01:08:55,735 --> 01:08:58,568
They come here, and before they take a breath...

954
01:08:58,738 --> 01:09:01,172
...they're telling us how to run the show.

955
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:03,069
The arrogance of this guy.

956
01:09:03,242 --> 01:09:07,702
Hey, all right. Let's stop the arguing for about two minutes in here.

957
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:09,677
Who's got something to say?

958
01:09:10,383 --> 01:09:13,875
l'd like to go over something if you don't mind.

959
01:09:14,053 --> 01:09:18,683
An important point for the prosecution was that after the boy claimed...

960
01:09:18,858 --> 01:09:21,383
...he'd been at the movies during the killing...

961
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:25,462
...he couldn't remember the movies or the stars in them.

962
01:09:25,765 --> 01:09:28,199
This gentleman has put up that point.

963
01:09:28,367 --> 01:09:31,359
Correct. lt was the only alibi the boy offered.

964
01:09:31,537 --> 01:09:34,028
And he couldn't back it up with details.

965
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:35,875
Do you think you could remember details...

966
01:09:35,875 --> 01:09:37,502
Do you think you could remember details...

967
01:09:37,676 --> 01:09:41,009
...after being slapped in the face by your father?

968
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:44,240
l think so. lf there were any special details.

969
01:09:44,416 --> 01:09:47,579
The boy couldn't remember, because he wasn't there.

970
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:52,853
The boy was questioned by detectives in the kitchen of his apartment...

971
01:09:53,025 --> 01:09:55,926
...while the body of his father was on the floor.

972
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:59,030
Could you remember under those circumstances?

973
01:09:59,198 --> 01:10:01,666
-Under great stress? -Under great stress.

974
01:10:01,834 --> 01:10:05,031
He remembered in court. He named the pictures and stars.

975
01:10:05,204 --> 01:10:08,605
Yes. His lawyer took great pains to bring that out.

976
01:10:08,774 --> 01:10:12,767
He had months from the murder to the trial to memoriZe them.

977
01:10:12,945 --> 01:10:17,314
lt's not difficult to find out what played at a particular theater.

978
01:10:17,483 --> 01:10:21,146
l'll take the testimony of the boy right after the murder...

979
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:25,586
...when he couldn't remember the movies, great stress or not.

980
01:10:25,991 --> 01:10:29,051
-l'd like to ask you a question. -Go ahead.

981
01:10:29,228 --> 01:10:32,288
-Where were you last night? -l was home.

982
01:10:32,464 --> 01:10:34,955
-How about the night before? -What is this?

983
01:10:35,134 --> 01:10:36,396
No, it's all right.

984
01:10:36,602 --> 01:10:38,934
l left the office at 8:30 and went home.

985
01:10:39,104 --> 01:10:43,302
-The night before that? -That was Tuesday night.

986
01:10:43,475 --> 01:10:46,376
-The night of the bridge tournament. -Monday?

987
01:10:46,545 --> 01:10:51,039
When you get down to New Year's Eve, 1 954, let me know, huh?

988
01:10:52,017 --> 01:10:54,144
Monday night?

989
01:10:55,154 --> 01:10:58,180
Monday night my wife and l went to the movies.

990
01:10:58,357 --> 01:11:01,292
-TheScarletCircle -What did you see? -The Scarlet Circle.

991
01:11:01,493 --> 01:11:04,257
-What was the second feature? -The....

992
01:11:06,031 --> 01:11:08,625
l'll tell you in a minute.

993
01:11:08,801 --> 01:11:13,898
The Remarkable Mrs.... Something....

994
01:11:15,641 --> 01:11:18,201
The Remarkable Mrs. Bainbridge.

995
01:11:18,377 --> 01:11:22,336
l saw that. lt's called The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge.

996
01:11:22,514 --> 01:11:24,709
Yes, that's right.

997
01:11:24,883 --> 01:11:27,283
TheAmazingMrs.Bainbridge Who was in The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge?

998
01:11:27,453 --> 01:11:33,824
Barbara Long, l think it was. A dark, very pretty girl.

999
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:37,024
Lind or Long, something like that.

1000
01:11:37,196 --> 01:11:40,359
-Who else? -l'd never heard of them before.

1001
01:11:40,532 --> 01:11:44,832
lt was a very inexpensive second feature with unknown....

1002
01:11:45,004 --> 01:11:48,804
And you weren't under an emotional stress, were you?

1003
01:11:50,943 --> 01:11:55,107
No, l wasn't.

1004
01:11:56,715 --> 01:12:00,913
-l think the point is made. -Big point.

1005
01:12:01,387 --> 01:12:05,221
Talk till your tongue is on the floor. The boy is guilty.

1006
01:12:05,391 --> 01:12:07,723
You know what l mean, my friend?

1007
01:12:07,893 --> 01:12:11,886
-You got those cough drops? -They're all gone, my friend.

1008
01:12:13,365 --> 01:12:17,665
Boy, look at that rain. There goes your ball game.

1009
01:12:17,836 --> 01:12:20,202
lt's only a shower.

1010
01:12:20,372 --> 01:12:22,806
Besides, they got the infield covered.

1011
01:12:22,975 --> 01:12:26,843
Say, could l see that knife a second, please?

1012
01:12:28,414 --> 01:12:32,851
We're still tied up, 6 to 6. Who's got a suggestion?

1013
01:12:33,018 --> 01:12:37,284
-lt's after 6, let's get dinner. -Wait until 7:00. Give it an hour.

1014
01:12:37,456 --> 01:12:38,889
Okay with me.

1015
01:12:39,925 --> 01:12:42,086
There's something l'd like to say.

1016
01:12:42,261 --> 01:12:45,662
lt's been bothering me, and as long as we're stuck....

1017
01:12:45,831 --> 01:12:49,631
This business about the stab wound and how it was made.

1018
01:12:49,802 --> 01:12:53,203
-The downward angle of it. -Don't start that again.

1019
01:12:53,372 --> 01:12:57,399
-They've been over it. -l know, but l don't go along with it.

1020
01:12:57,576 --> 01:13:01,603
The boy is 5'7'' tall. His father was 6'2''.

1021
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:03,975
A difference of 7 inches.

1022
01:13:04,149 --> 01:13:08,381
lt's awkward to stab down into someone who's a half-foot taller.

1023
01:13:08,554 --> 01:13:10,852
Give me that.

1024
01:13:11,023 --> 01:13:14,891
l'll give you a demonstration. Somebody get up.

1025
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:24,061
Watch this because l don't want to do it again.

1026
01:13:24,236 --> 01:13:27,034
l'll make myself 7 inches shorter. Okay?

1027
01:13:27,206 --> 01:13:31,336
-lt's about right. Maybe a little more. -Okay. A little more.

1028
01:13:42,588 --> 01:13:45,614
Now.... Nobody's hurt.

1029
01:13:45,858 --> 01:13:49,760
-Right? -Right. Nobody hurt.

1030
01:13:52,331 --> 01:13:57,132
Now, this is the way l'd stab a man who was taller than l was.

1031
01:13:57,302 --> 01:13:59,793
Look at the angle, down and in.

1032
01:13:59,972 --> 01:14:04,602
And this is the way it was done. Now tell me l'm wrong.

1033
01:14:06,445 --> 01:14:09,710
-Down and in. There's no argument. -Hold it, will you?

1034
01:14:09,882 --> 01:14:12,009
Will you give me that?

1035
01:14:12,684 --> 01:14:14,447
Boy, l hate these things.

1036
01:14:14,653 --> 01:14:16,280
-Ever see a knife fight? -No.

1037
01:14:16,455 --> 01:14:17,945
-You? -No.

1038
01:14:18,123 --> 01:14:20,921
Anybody here ever see a knife fight?

1039
01:14:21,093 --> 01:14:22,082
Well, l have.

1040
01:14:22,261 --> 01:14:26,163
You know, my back stoop, the lot across the street, back yard.

1041
01:14:26,331 --> 01:14:28,925
Switchblades came with the neighborhood.

1042
01:14:29,101 --> 01:14:31,865
l never thought of it. You try to forget.

1043
01:14:32,037 --> 01:14:36,667
-How do you use a switchblade? -Well, you'd never use it like this.

1044
01:14:37,242 --> 01:14:40,678
See, you lose too much time switching hands.

1045
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:44,474
Here's how, underhanded.

1046
01:14:46,351 --> 01:14:49,752
Anyone who's used a switch knife wouldn't handle it any other way.

1047
01:14:49,922 --> 01:14:52,254
-Are you sure? -l'm sure.

1048
01:14:52,424 --> 01:14:56,861
-That's why they open like that. -The boy was handy with the knife?

1049
01:14:57,029 --> 01:14:59,964
You think he could have made the wound?

1050
01:15:00,132 --> 01:15:04,193
No. Not with the experience he'd had handling these things.

1051
01:15:04,369 --> 01:15:07,497
-He'd have gone for him underhanded. -How do you know?

1052
01:15:07,673 --> 01:15:11,507
-Were you there in the room? -No. Neither was anybody else.

1053
01:15:11,677 --> 01:15:14,771
What are you giving us all this mumbo jumbo for?

1054
01:15:14,947 --> 01:15:18,439
l don't think you can determine what wound the boy made...

1055
01:15:18,617 --> 01:15:20,812
...because he knew how to handle a knife.

1056
01:15:20,986 --> 01:15:23,147
What do you think?

1057
01:15:23,422 --> 01:15:25,549
-l don't know. -What do you mean?

1058
01:15:25,724 --> 01:15:27,521
l don't know.

1059
01:15:31,563 --> 01:15:33,497
How about you?

1060
01:15:33,665 --> 01:15:37,157
l don't know about the rest, but l'm tired of this.

1061
01:15:37,336 --> 01:15:40,828
lt's getting us nowhere, so l guess l'll break it up.

1062
01:15:41,006 --> 01:15:43,531
l change my vote to not guilty.

1063
01:15:43,709 --> 01:15:46,974
-You what? -You heard me. l've had enough.

1064
01:15:47,145 --> 01:15:49,045
What? That's no answer.

1065
01:15:49,448 --> 01:15:53,350
Hey, listen, you just take care of yourself, huh? You know?

1066
01:15:53,518 --> 01:15:57,352
He's right. That's not an answer.

1067
01:15:57,723 --> 01:16:00,556
What kind of a man are you?

1068
01:16:00,726 --> 01:16:03,889
You sat here and voted guilty with everyone else...

1069
01:16:04,062 --> 01:16:08,158
...because there are baseball tickets burning a hole in your pocket.

1070
01:16:08,333 --> 01:16:13,168
And now you've changed your vote because you're sick of all the talking.

1071
01:16:13,338 --> 01:16:14,862
Now listen, buddy.

1072
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:19,773
Who tells you you have the right to play like this with a man's life?

1073
01:16:19,945 --> 01:16:22,277
-Don't you care? -Now wait a minute.

1074
01:16:22,447 --> 01:16:26,383
-You can't talk like that to me. -l can talk like that to you.

1075
01:16:26,551 --> 01:16:29,714
lf you vote not guilty, do it because you're convinced...

1076
01:16:29,888 --> 01:16:32,618
...the man is not guilty, not because you've had enough.

1077
01:16:32,791 --> 01:16:35,419
lf you think he is guilty, vote that way.

1078
01:16:35,827 --> 01:16:38,625
Don't you have the guts to do what is right?

1079
01:16:38,797 --> 01:16:40,992
-Now listen-- -Guilty or not guilty?

1080
01:16:41,933 --> 01:16:45,369
-l told you. Not guilty. -Why?

1081
01:16:47,139 --> 01:16:48,697
Look, l don't have to--

1082
01:16:48,874 --> 01:16:51,900
You do have to! Say it! Why?

1083
01:16:52,077 --> 01:16:56,036
All right, l don't think he's guilty.

1084
01:17:03,989 --> 01:17:08,050
-l want another vote. -Okay. Another vote is called for.

1085
01:17:08,226 --> 01:17:11,093
The quickest way is a show of hands.

1086
01:17:11,262 --> 01:17:14,993
Okay. All those voting not guilty, raise your hands.

1087
01:17:15,166 --> 01:17:21,127
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

1088
01:17:23,074 --> 01:17:24,666
...eight.

1089
01:17:29,914 --> 01:17:31,609
Nine.

1090
01:17:33,585 --> 01:17:36,679
All those voting guilty, raise your hands.

1091
01:17:36,855 --> 01:17:39,221
One, two, three.

1092
01:17:39,391 --> 01:17:42,724
The vote's 9 to 3 in favor of acquittal.

1093
01:17:42,894 --> 01:17:44,885
l don't understand you people.

1094
01:17:45,063 --> 01:17:48,590
All these picky points you bring up don't mean nothing.

1095
01:17:48,767 --> 01:17:50,667
You saw this kid like l did.

1096
01:17:50,835 --> 01:17:54,236
You believe that story about losing the knife...

1097
01:17:54,406 --> 01:17:56,374
...and that business about the movies?

1098
01:17:56,541 --> 01:17:59,408
These people lie. lt's born in them.

1099
01:17:59,577 --> 01:18:03,445
l don't have to tell you. They don't know what the truth is.

1100
01:18:03,615 --> 01:18:09,076
And let me tell you, they don't need any real big reason to kill someone.

1101
01:18:09,254 --> 01:18:13,281
They get drunk. They're real big drinkers, all of them.

1102
01:18:13,458 --> 01:18:16,791
Bang, someone's in the gutter. Nobody's blaming them.

1103
01:18:16,961 --> 01:18:21,022
That's the way they are, by nature. You know what l mean? Violent.

1104
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:22,461
Where are you going?

1105
01:18:22,634 --> 01:18:26,468
Human life don't mean as much to them as it does to us.

1106
01:18:26,638 --> 01:18:32,941
They're fighting all the time, and if somebody gets killed, they don't care.

1107
01:18:33,111 --> 01:18:37,172
There's good things about them. l'm the first one to say that.

1108
01:18:37,348 --> 01:18:40,909
l've known a couple who were okay, but that's the exception.

1109
01:18:41,086 --> 01:18:44,578
Most of them have no feelings. They can do anything.

1110
01:18:44,756 --> 01:18:47,384
What's going on here?

1111
01:18:47,892 --> 01:18:52,386
l'm trying to tell you you're making a big mistake. This kid is a liar.

1112
01:18:52,564 --> 01:18:55,590
l know it. l know all about them.

1113
01:18:56,301 --> 01:19:01,705
Listen to me, they're no good. There's not one of them who is any good.

1114
01:19:02,874 --> 01:19:05,308
l mean, what's happening in here?

1115
01:19:05,477 --> 01:19:08,844
l'm speaking my piece, and you--

1116
01:19:09,013 --> 01:19:11,140
Listen to me.

1117
01:19:14,185 --> 01:19:18,952
This kid on trial here, his type. Well, don't you know about them?

1118
01:19:19,691 --> 01:19:23,127
There's a danger here.

1119
01:19:23,294 --> 01:19:25,262
These people are dangerous.

1120
01:19:25,430 --> 01:19:28,422
They're wild.

1121
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,329
Listen to me.

1122
01:19:30,502 --> 01:19:32,834
-Listen. -l have.

1123
01:19:33,004 --> 01:19:37,236
Now sit down and don't open your mouth again.

1124
01:19:39,811 --> 01:19:43,804
Sometimes.... l tell you....

1125
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:24,317
lt's always difficult to keep personal prejudice out of a thing like this.

1126
01:20:24,489 --> 01:20:29,358
Wherever you run into it, prejudice always obscures the truth.

1127
01:20:30,161 --> 01:20:32,561
l don't really know what the truth is.

1128
01:20:32,730 --> 01:20:36,666
l don't suppose anybody will ever really know.

1129
01:20:36,834 --> 01:20:40,668
Nine of us now seem to feel that the defendant is innocent...

1130
01:20:40,838 --> 01:20:45,741
...but we're just gambling on probabilities. We may be wrong.

1131
01:20:45,910 --> 01:20:49,641
We may be trying to let a guilty man go free. l don't know.

1132
01:20:49,814 --> 01:20:54,274
Nobody really can, but we have a reasonable doubt...

1133
01:20:54,452 --> 01:20:58,218
...and that's something that's very valuable in our system.

1134
01:20:58,389 --> 01:21:03,884
No jury can declare a man guilty unless it's sure.

1135
01:21:04,195 --> 01:21:09,326
We nine can't understand how you three are still so sure.

1136
01:21:10,268 --> 01:21:13,431
-Maybe you can tell us. -l'll try.

1137
01:21:13,705 --> 01:21:17,266
You've made some points, but l believe the boy is guilty...

1138
01:21:17,442 --> 01:21:19,000
...and l have two reasons.

1139
01:21:19,177 --> 01:21:24,672
One: The evidence given by the woman who actually saw the murder committed.

1140
01:21:24,849 --> 01:21:27,545
That's the most important testimony.

1141
01:21:27,719 --> 01:21:32,156
Two: The fact that she described the stabbing by saying she saw the boy...

1142
01:21:32,323 --> 01:21:36,521
...raise his arm over his head and stab down into the father's chest

1143
01:21:36,694 --> 01:21:40,653
-She saw him do it, the wrong way. -That's absolutely right.

1144
01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:43,292
Let's talk about this woman.

1145
01:21:43,468 --> 01:21:46,596
She said she went to bed about 1 1 :00 that night.

1146
01:21:46,771 --> 01:21:50,229
Her bed was next to the window, and she could look out...

1147
01:21:50,408 --> 01:21:54,367
...and see directly into the boy's room across the street.

1148
01:21:54,545 --> 01:21:57,036
She tossed and turned for over an hour.

1149
01:21:57,215 --> 01:22:01,379
Finally, she turned toward the window at about 1 2:1 0...

1150
01:22:01,552 --> 01:22:03,042
...and as she looked out...

1151
01:22:03,221 --> 01:22:06,622
...she saw the killing through the windows of a train.

1152
01:22:06,791 --> 01:22:09,351
She said the lights went out after the killing...

1153
01:22:09,527 --> 01:22:15,227
...but that she got a good look at the boy in the act of stabbing his father.

1154
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:19,769
As far as l can see it, this is unshakable testimony.

1155
01:22:19,937 --> 01:22:24,169
-Well, that's the whole case. -What do you think?

1156
01:22:27,879 --> 01:22:30,143
How about you?

1157
01:22:31,549 --> 01:22:33,744
l don't know.

1158
01:22:33,918 --> 01:22:37,718
So much evidence to sift. This is a complicated business.

1159
01:22:37,889 --> 01:22:41,689
Frankly, l don't see how you can vote for acquittal.

1160
01:22:41,859 --> 01:22:44,259
lt's not easy to arrange the evidence.

1161
01:22:44,429 --> 01:22:47,421
Throw out the other evidence. The woman saw him.

1162
01:22:47,598 --> 01:22:49,896
What else do you want?

1163
01:22:50,068 --> 01:22:51,797
-Maybe-- -Let's vote on it.

1164
01:22:51,969 --> 01:22:55,996
Okay. There's another vote called for. Anyone object?

1165
01:22:56,174 --> 01:22:59,075
All right. l'm changing my vote. He's guilty.

1166
01:22:59,477 --> 01:23:01,672
Anybody else? The vote is 8 to 4.

1167
01:23:01,846 --> 01:23:05,247
Why is this such a personal triumph? lt's one vote.

1168
01:23:05,416 --> 01:23:08,874
l say we're a hung jury. l say we take it to the judge.

1169
01:23:09,053 --> 01:23:11,851
How about it? l want to hear arguments.

1170
01:23:12,023 --> 01:23:15,390
You, you're the leader of the cause, what about it?

1171
01:23:16,527 --> 01:23:20,156
-Let's go over it again. -We've been over it again.

1172
01:23:20,331 --> 01:23:25,166
The boy in the suit here is bouncing backwards and forwards like a ball.

1173
01:23:25,336 --> 01:23:30,774
No point in getting nasty. You keep trying to turn this into a contest.

1174
01:23:31,242 --> 01:23:32,504
Okay.

1175
01:23:32,677 --> 01:23:35,612
Maybe we can talk about setting a time limit?

1176
01:23:35,780 --> 01:23:38,544
Yeah, once around for the deal, huh?

1177
01:23:38,716 --> 01:23:44,518
lt's a quarter after 6. Someone before mentioned 7:00.

1178
01:23:44,689 --> 01:23:50,127
That's a point at which we can discuss whether it's a hung jury or not.

1179
01:23:50,461 --> 01:23:55,262
-Don't you feel well? -l feel perfectly well, thank you.

1180
01:23:55,433 --> 01:23:58,266
l was saying that 7:00 would be a reasonable--

1181
01:23:58,436 --> 01:24:03,271
The reason l asked about that was because you rub your nose like--

1182
01:24:03,441 --> 01:24:08,777
l'm sorry, but you made a gesture that reminded me of something.

1183
01:24:08,946 --> 01:24:13,883
-l'm trying to settle something here. -Well, l think this is important.

1184
01:24:14,352 --> 01:24:15,876
Thank you.

1185
01:24:16,053 --> 01:24:18,578
Now, l'm sure you'll pardon me for this...

1186
01:24:18,756 --> 01:24:21,953
...but l was wondering why you rub your nose like that.

1187
01:24:22,126 --> 01:24:23,388
Come on!

1188
01:24:23,561 --> 01:24:27,588
l happen to be talking to the gentleman sitting next to you!

1189
01:24:27,765 --> 01:24:30,791
Now, why were you rubbing your nose like that?

1190
01:24:31,335 --> 01:24:35,328
Well, l was rubbing it because it bothers me a little.

1191
01:24:35,506 --> 01:24:39,135
l'm sorry. ls it because of your eyeglasses?

1192
01:24:39,310 --> 01:24:41,846
lt is. Now can we get on to something else?

1193
01:24:41,846 --> 01:24:42,574
lt is. Now can we get on to something else?

1194
01:24:42,746 --> 01:24:47,274
Your eyeglasses made those deep impressions on the sides of your nose.

1195
01:24:47,451 --> 01:24:51,012
l hadn't noticed that before. That must be annoying.

1196
01:24:51,188 --> 01:24:53,179
lt is very annoying.

1197
01:24:53,357 --> 01:24:59,193
Well, l wouldn't know about that. l've never worn eyeglasses. 20l20.

1198
01:24:59,363 --> 01:25:02,924
Will you come on already with the optometrist bit?

1199
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:06,592
The woman who testified that she saw the killing...

1200
01:25:06,770 --> 01:25:11,070
...had those same marks on the sides of her nose.

1201
01:25:11,275 --> 01:25:14,938
-Holy smokes. You know, he's right. -Quiet, please.

1202
01:25:15,112 --> 01:25:19,048
Just give me a minute, and l'll be finished.

1203
01:25:19,216 --> 01:25:22,014
l don't know if anyone else noticed that.

1204
01:25:22,186 --> 01:25:28,352
l didn't think of it then, but l've been going over her face in my mind.

1205
01:25:29,159 --> 01:25:33,425
She had those same marks. She kept rubbing them in court.

1206
01:25:33,998 --> 01:25:36,262
He's right. She did do that a lot.

1207
01:25:37,434 --> 01:25:42,064
This woman was about 45 years old.

1208
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:48,303
She was making a tremendous effort to look 35 for her public appearance.

1209
01:25:48,512 --> 01:25:51,811
Heavy makeup, dyed hair...

1210
01:25:51,982 --> 01:25:55,713
...new clothes that should have been worn by a younger woman.

1211
01:25:55,886 --> 01:26:02,121
No glasses. Women do that. See if you can get the mental picture of it.

1212
01:26:02,293 --> 01:26:05,262
What do you mean, no glasses? How do you know?

1213
01:26:05,429 --> 01:26:08,626
-Because she was rubbing her nose? -She had those marks.

1214
01:26:09,033 --> 01:26:12,469
-What do you think that means? -l'm sick of your yelling--

1215
01:26:12,636 --> 01:26:13,967
Come on, forget it.

1216
01:26:14,138 --> 01:26:18,541
Listen. He's right. l saw them too. l was the closest one to her.

1217
01:26:18,709 --> 01:26:21,769
She had these things on her nose. What do you call those?

1218
01:26:21,946 --> 01:26:26,110
What point are you making? She had dyed hair and marks on her nose.

1219
01:26:26,283 --> 01:26:27,614
What does that mean?

1220
01:26:27,785 --> 01:26:33,519
Could these marks be made by anything other than eyeglasses?

1221
01:26:35,659 --> 01:26:37,889
No, they couldn't.

1222
01:26:38,062 --> 01:26:41,361
l didn't see any marks.

1223
01:26:41,632 --> 01:26:45,864
l did. Strange, but l didn't think about it before.

1224
01:26:46,036 --> 01:26:48,527
What about the lawyer? Why didn't he say something?

1225
01:26:48,706 --> 01:26:53,302
There are 1 2 people in here. Eleven of us didn't think of it either.

1226
01:26:53,477 --> 01:26:55,104
What about the D.A.?

1227
01:26:55,279 --> 01:26:58,510
Do you think he'd have her testify without glasses?

1228
01:26:58,682 --> 01:27:03,085
Ever see a woman who didn't want glasses, because they spoil her looks?

1229
01:27:03,253 --> 01:27:06,188
Okay. She had marks on her nose.

1230
01:27:06,357 --> 01:27:09,952
l'm giving you that. From glasses, right?

1231
01:27:10,127 --> 01:27:14,359
She didn't want to wear them so people would think she's gorgeous.

1232
01:27:14,531 --> 01:27:18,968
But when she saw this kid killing his father, she was alone.

1233
01:27:19,136 --> 01:27:21,001
That's all.

1234
01:27:21,338 --> 01:27:23,431
Do you wear glasses to bed?

1235
01:27:23,607 --> 01:27:28,772
No, l don't. No one wears eyeglasses to bed.

1236
01:27:28,946 --> 01:27:33,474
lt's logical to assume that she wasn't wearing them when she was in bed.

1237
01:27:33,650 --> 01:27:35,948
-How do you know? -l'm guessing.

1238
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:40,648
l'm guessing she didn't put her glasses on when she looked out the window.

1239
01:27:40,824 --> 01:27:43,987
She testified the killing took place just as she looked.

1240
01:27:44,161 --> 01:27:46,652
She couldn't have had time to put them on.

1241
01:27:46,830 --> 01:27:48,525
-Wait-- -Here's another guess.

1242
01:27:48,699 --> 01:27:52,658
She honestly thought she saw the boy. l say she saw a blur.

1243
01:27:52,836 --> 01:27:56,533
How do you know what she saw? How does he know all that?

1244
01:27:56,707 --> 01:28:01,007
How do you know what kind of glasses she wore? Maybe she was farsighted.

1245
01:28:01,178 --> 01:28:05,774
-What do you know about it? -The woman's sight is in question now.

1246
01:28:05,949 --> 01:28:11,478
She had to identify a person 60 feet away, at night, without glasses.

1247
01:28:11,655 --> 01:28:14,920
You can't send someone to die on evidence like that.

1248
01:28:15,092 --> 01:28:16,286
Don't give me that.

1249
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:19,258
-You think she might've made a mistake? -No.

1250
01:28:19,596 --> 01:28:22,497
-lt's not possible? -No, it's not possible.

1251
01:28:25,636 --> 01:28:28,127
ls it possible?

1252
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:30,731
Not guilty.

1253
01:28:34,511 --> 01:28:36,843
Do you think he's guilty?

1254
01:28:37,214 --> 01:28:39,876
l think he's guilty.

1255
01:28:41,985 --> 01:28:43,919
Do you?

1256
01:28:46,523 --> 01:28:47,854
No.

1257
01:28:48,025 --> 01:28:50,960
l'm convinced. Not guilty.

1258
01:28:51,128 --> 01:28:54,825
-What's the matter with you? -l have a reasonable doubt now.

1259
01:28:54,998 --> 01:28:56,556
lt's 1 1 to 1 .

1260
01:28:56,767 --> 01:29:01,727
What about all the other evidence? The knife, the whole business?

1261
01:29:01,905 --> 01:29:05,636
You said we could throw out all the other evidence.

1262
01:29:10,614 --> 01:29:13,344
Well, what do we do now?

1263
01:29:15,919 --> 01:29:17,318
You're alone.

1264
01:29:17,988 --> 01:29:22,152
l don't care whether l'm alone or not. lt's my right.

1265
01:29:24,595 --> 01:29:26,563
lt's your right.

1266
01:29:35,772 --> 01:29:38,741
Well, what do you want? l say he's guilty.

1267
01:29:39,877 --> 01:29:44,007
-We want to hear your arguments. -l gave you my arguments.

1268
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:48,544
We're not convinced. We want to hear them again.

1269
01:29:49,186 --> 01:29:52,121
We have as much time as it takes.

1270
01:29:56,927 --> 01:29:58,258
Everything.

1271
01:29:58,428 --> 01:30:03,365
Every single thing that took place in that courtroom says he's guilty.

1272
01:30:03,534 --> 01:30:06,560
What do you think, l'm an idiot or something?

1273
01:30:07,538 --> 01:30:10,234
Why don't you take that stuff about the old man...

1274
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:13,898
...who lived there and heard everything?

1275
01:30:14,578 --> 01:30:18,514
This business about the knife. Because we found another one?

1276
01:30:18,682 --> 01:30:21,981
The old man saw him right there, on the stairs.

1277
01:30:22,152 --> 01:30:25,315
What's the difference how many seconds it was?

1278
01:30:25,856 --> 01:30:28,689
Every single thing.

1279
01:30:29,326 --> 01:30:32,557
The knife falling through a hole in his pocket.

1280
01:30:32,729 --> 01:30:35,994
You can't prove he didn't get to the door.

1281
01:30:36,166 --> 01:30:41,001
Sure you can take time, hobble around the room, but you can't prove it.

1282
01:30:43,407 --> 01:30:46,672
What about this business of the El and the movies?

1283
01:30:46,843 --> 01:30:49,812
There's a phony deal if l ever heard one.

1284
01:30:49,980 --> 01:30:54,178
l'll bet you $5000 l'd remember the movies l saw.

1285
01:30:54,351 --> 01:31:00,312
l'm telling you, everything that's gone on has been twisted and turned.

1286
01:31:00,490 --> 01:31:02,515
This business with the glasses.

1287
01:31:02,693 --> 01:31:08,188
How do you know she didn't have them on? This woman testified in open court.

1288
01:31:08,365 --> 01:31:10,993
And what about hearing the kid yell?

1289
01:31:12,336 --> 01:31:16,102
l'm telling you, l've got all the facts here.

1290
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:18,039
Here.

1291
01:31:20,978 --> 01:31:23,947
That's it, that's the whole case.

1292
01:31:30,687 --> 01:31:32,018
Well?

1293
01:31:34,558 --> 01:31:36,526
Say something!

1294
01:31:41,798 --> 01:31:45,791
You lousy bunch of bleeding hearts.

1295
01:31:45,969 --> 01:31:51,134
You're not going to intimidate me. l'm entitled to my opinion.

1296
01:31:54,044 --> 01:31:58,640
Rotten kid. You work your life out!

1297
01:32:09,326 --> 01:32:11,055
No....

1298
01:32:15,165 --> 01:32:17,133
Not guilty.

1299
01:32:20,370 --> 01:32:22,167
Not guilty.

1300
01:32:37,688 --> 01:32:39,622
We're ready now.

1301
01:34:32,869 --> 01:34:34,234
Hey!

1302
01:34:39,042 --> 01:34:41,943
-What's your name? -Davis.

1303
01:34:42,179 --> 01:34:44,340
My name's McCardle.

1304
01:34:46,716 --> 01:34:48,252
-Well, so long. -So long.

1305
01:34:48,252 --> 01:34:49,810
-Well, so long. -So long.
