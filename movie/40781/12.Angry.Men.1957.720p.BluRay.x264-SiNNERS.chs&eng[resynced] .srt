地方法院

3
00:01:18,781 --> 00:01:22,046
你做的很好，非常好

4
00:01:28,658 --> 00:01:33,960
漫长复杂的审理程序已经结束 这是一宗一级谋杀案

5
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:39,033
预谋杀人在刑事诉讼中 是刑责最重的罪名

6
00:01:39,201 --> 00:01:43,729
你们都已经听过证词 也明明白法律条文的规定

7
00:01:43,906 --> 00:01:48,570
现在你们必须坐下来 好好地厘清这宗案子的真伪

8
00:01:48,744 --> 00:01:52,942
在本案中已有一人身亡 另一个人的生死掌握在你们手上

9
00:01:53,115 --> 00:01:57,074
如果你们能提出合理的怀疑 无法确认被告是否有罪...

10
00:01:57,253 --> 00:02:01,986
基于这个合理的怀疑 你们必须做出无罪的判决

11
00:02:02,158 --> 00:02:06,151
如果你们找不出合理的怀疑 你们必须基于良知...

12
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:09,093
判决被告有罪

13
00:02:09,265 --> 00:02:13,065
然而你们的决定必须一致

14
00:02:13,235 --> 00:02:19,697
如果你们裁定被告有罪 本庭将会对他施以严厉的惩罚

15
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:23,333
最高的刑罚会是死刑

16
00:02:23,813 --> 00:02:28,876
这是一项沉重的责任 谢谢各位

17
00:02:29,051 --> 00:02:32,214
后备陪审员可以离去

18
00:02:37,226 --> 00:02:39,922
陪审团请退下

19
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,894
12怒汉

20
00:05:00,002 --> 00:05:01,492
要来块口香糖吗？

21
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:06,300
- 我不要，谢谢 - 这扇窗户卡住了

22
00:05:08,911 --> 00:05:12,312
快来帮帮我 好了

23
00:05:16,818 --> 00:05:20,151
你知道吗？ 我打电话问过气象局

24
00:05:20,322 --> 00:05:23,985
今天将是今年中最热的一天

25
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:28,186
- 我还以为这里有空调 - 先生，请问尊姓大名？

26
00:05:28,363 --> 00:05:30,593
- 就是那个 - 谢谢你

27
00:05:30,766 --> 00:05:33,667
好了，各位，大家都到了

28
00:05:33,835 --> 00:05:38,602
如果你们需要别的东西 我就在外面，尽管叫我

29
00:05:51,553 --> 00:05:54,215
我不知道他们会锁上门

30
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:57,449
他们当然会锁门 你以为他们会怎么做？

31
00:05:57,626 --> 00:06:00,686
我不知道 我只是从来没想过会有这种事

32
00:06:01,496 --> 00:06:05,364
- 那是什么东西？ - 我还以为我们要投票表决

33
00:06:05,534 --> 00:06:09,334
好主意 或许我们该选他当参议员

34
00:06:15,677 --> 00:06:19,443
- 你觉得如何？ - 我不知道，挺有趣的

35
00:06:19,614 --> 00:06:22,048
是吗？我差点就睡着了

36
00:06:22,217 --> 00:06:28,087
- 我从来没有当过陪审员 - 是吗？我有很多次的经验

37
00:06:28,256 --> 00:06:33,353
律师们说的话让我很火大 凶手是谁真的是太明显了

38
00:06:33,528 --> 00:06:37,294
- 你听过这么多无聊的话吗？ - 那是他们的工作

39
00:06:37,466 --> 00:06:40,367
一点都没错，这就是司法系统

40
00:06:40,535 --> 00:06:44,869
我觉得现在孩子得吃点苦头 才不敢惹麻烦

41
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,940
这能帮我们省下时间跟金钱

42
00:06:47,109 --> 00:06:48,974
- 开始裁决吧 - 好主意

43
00:06:49,144 --> 00:06:51,772
大家动作快一点 我们还有很多工作要做

44
00:06:51,947 --> 00:06:56,008
先等一下 还有一个人在洗手间里

45
00:06:56,184 --> 00:07:00,985
- 我们照常规坐吗？ - 我不知道，应该是吧

46
00:07:05,427 --> 00:07:06,860
你坐到我的位置了

47
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:09,429
- 对不起 - 没关系

48
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,900
这里的风景还不错吧

49
00:07:16,805 --> 00:07:19,069
你对这个案子有什么看法？

50
00:07:19,241 --> 00:07:25,305
我觉得很有趣，一点都不无聊 你瞭解我的意思吧

51
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,005
能遇上谋杀案算我们运气好

52
00:07:28,183 --> 00:07:32,552
我还以为我们会遇上伤害案 或窃盗案，那真的很无聊

53
00:07:34,022 --> 00:07:38,482
- 那是伍尔沃斯大楼吗？ - 没错

54
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:43,220
我从小到大都住在纽约 却从来没有去过那里

55
00:07:43,398 --> 00:07:47,528
你们得抽丝剥茧地把案情弄清楚 就跟电影上演的一样

56
00:07:47,702 --> 00:07:50,637
对，关于凶刀 又是怎么一回事呢？

57
00:07:50,806 --> 00:07:53,707
他们竟要我们这些成年人 去相信那种胡言乱语

58
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:58,175
- 我早就知道事情会变成这样 - 你说的对

59
00:07:58,447 --> 00:08:02,747
你的鼻子通了，现在来看看 你的眼睛吧，你感冒了吗？

60
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:08,254
因为太热引起的感冒真是要人命 我只要一摸鼻子就会觉得很痛

61
00:08:08,423 --> 00:08:11,859
我真的瞭解，我感冒才刚好

62
00:08:12,027 --> 00:08:16,623
- 快点，团长先生，要开始了 - 那家伙还在洗手间里

63
00:08:16,798 --> 00:08:20,461
有什么消息吗？ 我还没有空看文件

64
00:08:20,635 --> 00:08:25,766
- 不知道今天的股市指数是多少？ - 你是做股票的？

65
00:08:25,941 --> 00:08:27,533
我是股票经纪人

66
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:32,078
我开了一间传呼公司 叫做贝克传呼公司

67
00:08:32,247 --> 00:08:37,947
公司名字是我太太取的 我白手起家，现在雇了37个人

68
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,612
好了，大家快坐下

69
00:08:44,493 --> 00:08:49,624
好了，我们可以很快离开这里 我已经买好今晚的球赛门票

70
00:08:49,798 --> 00:08:51,390
是洋基队对克利夫兰队的比赛

71
00:08:51,566 --> 00:08:56,731
本案的被告是摩杰路斯基 这孩子简直无药可救

72
00:08:57,472 --> 00:09:00,066
他应该被关进牢里，你知道吗？

73
00:09:01,977 --> 00:09:04,468
你真的很喜欢看棒球，对吧？

74
00:09:04,646 --> 00:09:05,977
我们要坐在哪里？

75
00:09:06,148 --> 00:09:09,140
我想我们得依照 陪审员的编号坐下

76
00:09:09,317 --> 00:09:13,151
一、二、三，以此类推 沿着桌子坐下，希望大家别介意

77
00:09:13,321 --> 00:09:16,154
- 那有什么差别呢？ - 听起来挺合理的

78
00:09:16,324 --> 00:09:18,918
- 就这么办吧 - 十二号要坐在你的右手边吗？

79
00:09:19,094 --> 00:09:22,860
- 对，沿着顺时钟方向坐下 - 从你开始，一、二....

80
00:09:23,031 --> 00:09:26,467
你对检察官的印象如何？

81
00:09:27,135 --> 00:09:28,432
你说什么？

82
00:09:28,603 --> 00:09:32,869
我觉得他很尖锐 像连珠炮似地提出问题...

83
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,874
但前后顺序相当有逻辑 让我留下了深刻的印象

84
00:09:36,044 --> 00:09:42,279
- 我觉得他非常专业 - 也非常有冲劲

85
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,782
- 大夥们，请安静 - 没问题

86
00:09:44,953 --> 00:09:50,050
我们就要开始了 站在窗户旁边的先生

87
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,154
- 我们就要开始了 - 对不起

88
00:09:53,328 --> 00:09:57,059
这真的很难懂，对吧？ 那孩子杀了他的父亲

89
00:09:57,232 --> 00:09:59,792
听我说，这种事常发生

90
00:09:59,968 --> 00:10:04,837
养子不教父之过 或许那是他活该

91
00:10:05,006 --> 00:10:08,169
- 大家都到了吗？ - 那老头还在洗手间里

92
00:10:08,343 --> 00:10:11,312
- 麻烦你去叫他过来好吗？ - 没问题

93
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:14,676
- 你是洋基队的球迷吗？ - 不，我支持巴尔的摩队

94
00:10:15,417 --> 00:10:16,850
巴尔的摩队？

95
00:10:17,986 --> 00:10:22,116
那就像是每天 头都会被铁橇敲上一记

96
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:26,124
除了他们的外野手还不错之外 他们有什么厉害的？

97
00:10:26,294 --> 00:10:28,091
我们要开始了

98
00:10:28,263 --> 00:10:31,562
对不起 我不是故意要你们等我

99
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:33,462
巴尔的摩队！

100
00:10:33,635 --> 00:10:36,195
好了，各位 请注意听我说

101
00:10:37,105 --> 00:10:42,133
你们想要怎么做都可以 我不打算制定任何规则

102
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:48,215
我们可以先进行讨论再来表决 那是一种可行的方法

103
00:10:48,383 --> 00:10:51,079
当然啰 我们也可以立刻进行表决

104
00:10:51,253 --> 00:10:53,915
我想依照惯例 我们得先进行假投票

105
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:58,788
我们来投票吧，谁知道呢 或许我们可以立刻离开这里

106
00:10:59,361 --> 00:11:05,459
好吧，大家都知道 这是一宗一级谋杀案...

107
00:11:05,634 --> 00:11:11,698
如果我们裁决被告有罪 那等于是送他坐上电椅

108
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:14,437
- 那是必然的结果 - 我们知道

109
00:11:14,609 --> 00:11:18,670
- 好了，现在来表决吧 - 有人反对进行表决吗？

110
00:11:18,847 --> 00:11:20,838
我没意见

111
00:11:21,549 --> 00:11:27,613
记住，不论如何 我们都得达成共识，那是规定

112
00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:33,921
大家都准备好了吗？ 认为他“有罪”的人请举手

113
00:11:36,998 --> 00:11:41,526
一、二、三、四 五、六、七...

114
00:11:41,703 --> 00:11:47,073
八、九、十、十一 十一个人认为他有罪

115
00:11:47,242 --> 00:11:49,267
认为他“无罪”的人请举手

116
00:11:49,944 --> 00:11:55,280
一票，好吧 十一票有罪，一票无罪

117
00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:01,582
- 至少现在我们有结论了 - 天啊，总是会出现唱反调的人

118
00:12:01,756 --> 00:12:03,917
我们现在该怎么办呢？

119
00:12:04,626 --> 00:12:07,356
- 我猜我们得好好讨论一下 - 天啊

120
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:09,963
你真的觉得他是无辜的？

121
00:12:13,101 --> 00:12:16,628
- 我不知道 - 你跟我们一样坐在法庭里

122
00:12:16,805 --> 00:12:19,603
你应该可以看得出来 那孩子是个危险的杀手

123
00:12:19,774 --> 00:12:23,210
- 他才十八岁 - 他已经够大了

124
00:12:23,378 --> 00:12:26,108
他拿刀子往他父亲的胸口戳去 把他给杀了

125
00:12:26,281 --> 00:12:31,048
在法庭上他们不断证明了这一点 你要我一一跟你说明吗？

126
00:12:31,219 --> 00:12:32,481
不必了

127
00:12:32,954 --> 00:12:35,923
- 你到底想怎么样？ - 我只是想谈一谈

128
00:12:36,091 --> 00:12:41,427
你想谈什么？十一票“有罪” 除了你，大家都达成了共识

129
00:12:41,596 --> 00:12:44,622
我想问你 你真的相信他的说词？

130
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:49,236
- 我不知道，或许我不相信 - 你为什么会认为他“无罪”？

131
00:12:49,404 --> 00:12:53,033
十一个人都认为他“有罪” 我真的很难举起手...

132
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:56,268
送这个孩子坐电椅 完全不去讨论这件事

133
00:12:56,444 --> 00:12:59,572
- 谁说这很容易了？ - 没人

134
00:13:00,081 --> 00:13:04,643
你以为我是胡乱举手的吗？ 我真的觉得那孩子有罪

135
00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:07,481
就算谈上一百年 也无法改变我的想法

136
00:13:07,655 --> 00:13:12,592
我不想改变你 但这个判决攸关一条人命

137
00:13:12,761 --> 00:13:14,820
假设我们错了呢

138
00:13:14,996 --> 00:13:19,399
假设这栋房子会倒塌 什么事都是有可能的

139
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:20,966
一点都没错

140
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:25,503
要花多少时间又有什么差别 或许我们花五分钟就能解决此事

141
00:13:26,274 --> 00:13:30,540
我们可以花一小时来讨论 球赛八点才会开始

142
00:13:35,784 --> 00:13:39,185
- 谁有意见？ - 如果只有一小时应该没关系

143
00:13:39,354 --> 00:13:44,656
- 太棒了，我已经听过所有说法- -  - 那不是我们坐在这里的原因

144
00:13:44,826 --> 00:13:49,593
好吧，请你告诉我 我们为什么要坐在这里？

145
00:13:49,764 --> 00:13:56,033
我不知道，或许那是没有原因的 这孩子老是被踢来踢去

146
00:13:56,204 --> 00:14:00,072
他在贫民窟出生 九岁时母亲就过世了

147
00:14:00,241 --> 00:14:05,474
他在孤儿院待过一年半 当时他父亲因为伪造文书罪入狱

148
00:14:05,647 --> 00:14:11,586
他是先天不良，他是个 充满愤怒的野孩子，为什么？

149
00:14:11,753 --> 00:14:15,689
因为每天都会有人打他

150
00:14:15,857 --> 00:14:21,022
他过了悲惨的十八年 我觉得我们该给他一个机会

151
00:14:21,196 --> 00:14:25,690
我们什么都不欠他 他得到公平的审判了，不是吗？

152
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:30,566
你觉得那场审判要花掉多少钱 他有这样的机会就已经够幸运了

153
00:14:30,738 --> 00:14:34,902
听着，大家都是成年人 我们都听到了实际经过，对吧？

154
00:14:35,076 --> 00:14:39,012
我们不该相信那孩子的说法 我们都知道他是什么样的人

155
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:44,880
我跟那样的人生活过，你不能相信 他们说的话，你知道的

156
00:14:45,053 --> 00:14:49,114
- 他们一生下来就是骗子 - 只有无知的人才会相信那些话

157
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,383
- 听我说 - 你天生就...

158
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:56,189
相信真理吗？ 有足够的证据能证明他的罪行

159
00:14:56,364 --> 00:15:01,233
- 我们不需要听你训话 - 我们还有工作要做，快开始吧

160
00:15:01,402 --> 00:15:05,031
这是爆米花，我的公司 负责推销这种产品

161
00:15:05,206 --> 00:15:08,698
“天生充满活力的早餐” 这句广告词是我写的

162
00:15:08,877 --> 00:15:10,242
- 真的很传神 - 没错

163
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:13,608
- 请安静 - 对不起

164
00:15:13,781 --> 00:15:16,249
随手涂鸭反而能让我沉淀思绪

165
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:19,648
我们还有事要做 没有必要把时间耗在这里

166
00:15:19,821 --> 00:15:25,987
好吧，坐在那边的先生 不同意我们的看法...

167
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,723
如果你可以告诉我们为什么 或许我们能告诉你你哪里弄错了

168
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,461
这方法挺不错的 我并没有想太多，但....

169
00:15:35,637 --> 00:15:40,768
似乎我们得说服他 他错了，我们才是对的

170
00:15:40,942 --> 00:15:45,777
或许我们该花几分钟的时间 好好地- - ，那只是我的提议

171
00:15:45,947 --> 00:15:50,952
不，你的提议很棒 我们照顺序一一发言吧

172
00:15:50,952 --> 00:15:52,852
从你先来

173
00:15:56,791 --> 00:16:02,024
这真的很难说出个为什么 我就是觉得他有罪

174
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:06,189
从证词来看一切非常明显 没有人能证明他无罪

175
00:16:06,367 --> 00:16:10,326
也没有人该那么做 该证明他无罪的人是检察官

176
00:16:10,505 --> 00:16:14,805
被告不必发言 那是宪法规定的权利

177
00:16:14,976 --> 00:16:18,571
我知道，但我的意思是- - 

178
00:16:19,881 --> 00:16:23,612
我就是觉得他有罪 有目击者看到他杀人

179
00:16:23,785 --> 00:16:28,984
好了，这就是我的想法 对本案我并没有个人偏见...

180
00:16:29,157 --> 00:16:31,785
我只是想讨论事实

181
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,359
首先：

182
00:16:34,662 --> 00:16:38,894
住在凶案现场 楼下的那个老人

183
00:16:39,067 --> 00:16:44,528
在凶案发生当晚的十二点十分 他听到类似发生争执的吵闹声

184
00:16:44,706 --> 00:16:47,698
他听到那个孩子大叫着 “我要杀了你”

185
00:16:47,876 --> 00:16:50,276
一秒钟后他听见有人摔倒的声音

186
00:16:50,445 --> 00:16:54,541
于是他跑到门口 看到那孩子冲下楼梯离开

187
00:16:54,716 --> 00:16:58,846
他打电话报警 警方发现死者胸口插了一把刀

188
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:02,319
法医推测死亡时间 大约是午夜

189
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:07,257
这些都是事实，你无法反驳事实 那孩子有罪

190
00:17:07,428 --> 00:17:11,364
我跟其他人一样有同情心 我知道那孩子只有十八岁

191
00:17:11,533 --> 00:17:14,696
- 但他还是得付出代价 - 我同意你的说法

192
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:17,394
好了，你说完了吗？

193
00:17:17,572 --> 00:17:18,937
- 我说完了 - 下一位

194
00:17:19,107 --> 00:17:22,565
很明显地那孩子的说词 根本都是在瞎编

195
00:17:22,744 --> 00:17:24,837
他说案发时他在看电影...

196
00:17:25,013 --> 00:17:28,608
但他完全想不起来 那部电影跟演员们的名字

197
00:17:28,783 --> 00:17:31,684
- 没错 - 没有人看到他进出电影院

198
00:17:31,853 --> 00:17:35,687
住在对街的那个女人 所做出的证词呢？

199
00:17:35,857 --> 00:17:40,419
- 她看到他杀人 - 好了，请大家照顺序来

200
00:17:40,595 --> 00:17:46,192
等一下，案发时这个女人 躺在床上，她睡不着

201
00:17:46,367 --> 00:17:48,733
她热到受不了，你明白吧？

202
00:17:48,903 --> 00:17:55,240
她从窗户往外看，看到那孩子 将刀子插进他父亲的胸口

203
00:17:55,410 --> 00:18:00,905
时间是十二点十分，完全吻合 她是看着那孩子长大的

204
00:18:01,082 --> 00:18:04,643
他家跟她家只隔了一条电车轨道 她目睹他杀人的经过

205
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:07,549
当时刚好 有一列电车经过

206
00:18:07,856 --> 00:18:11,792
这辆电车上没有乘客 它是要开到市区去的

207
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,518
当时车上的灯光全暗

208
00:18:13,695 --> 00:18:16,892
律师证明了透过电车车窗 的确可以看到东西...

209
00:18:17,065 --> 00:18:20,557
只要灯光是暗的 你可以看到另一边的景象

210
00:18:20,735 --> 00:18:22,532
我想问你一个问题

211
00:18:22,704 --> 00:18:29,007
你不相信那孩子，为什么会相信 这个女人呢？她跟他是一样的

212
00:18:30,044 --> 00:18:33,980
- 你以为自己很聪明，对吧？ - 各位

213
00:18:34,148 --> 00:18:38,482
- 好了，坐下吧 - 他有什么好得意的？

214
00:18:38,653 --> 00:18:43,113
好了，我们不是来吵架的 现在轮到谁了？

215
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,919
轮到他了，他是五号

216
00:18:49,264 --> 00:18:51,391
我可以弃权吗？

217
00:18:51,933 --> 00:18:56,961
那是你的权利 下一位

218
00:18:58,139 --> 00:19:04,567
我不知道，打从一开始 我就相信他有罪

219
00:19:04,746 --> 00:19:07,840
我一直在寻找他的犯罪动机

220
00:19:08,016 --> 00:19:13,420
这真的很重要，没有犯罪动机 案子就无法成立

221
00:19:13,588 --> 00:19:19,117
住在那孩子家对面的人 在法庭上做出的证词...

222
00:19:19,294 --> 00:19:21,285
非常有力

223
00:19:21,462 --> 00:19:24,920
何况他们提到 死者跟他儿子...

224
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:30,662
约七点时曾发生过争吵 或许我错了，但我- - 

225
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:32,703
- 是八点才对 - 没错

226
00:19:32,874 --> 00:19:36,002
他们听到了争吵声 却听不清楚到底发生了什么事

227
00:19:36,177 --> 00:19:38,771
他们听到死者 打了他儿子两下

228
00:19:38,947 --> 00:19:42,940
他们看到那孩子愤怒地冲出家门 那能证明什么呢？

229
00:19:43,117 --> 00:19:46,484
那无法证明任何事 那只是事实的一部份

230
00:19:46,654 --> 00:19:51,353
你说那证明了凶手有杀人动机 但我觉得这样的动机不够强烈

231
00:19:51,526 --> 00:19:57,726
这孩子常常被打 暴力对他来说是司空见惯的事

232
00:19:57,899 --> 00:20:02,461
我不觉得被打了两个耳光 就足以让他气到去杀人

233
00:20:02,637 --> 00:20:06,573
或许他真的被逼到受不了 每个人都有极限

234
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:09,599
你还有话要说吗？

235
00:20:10,545 --> 00:20:14,641
- 没有了 - 好吧，你呢？

236
00:20:16,551 --> 00:20:19,349
我不知道，话都被他们说完了

237
00:20:19,821 --> 00:20:23,382
我们可以一直耗下去 结论还是一样的

238
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,986
这个孩子真的杀了人

239
00:20:26,828 --> 00:20:28,591
看看他的记录

240
00:20:28,763 --> 00:20:32,893
他十岁就进了少年法庭 因为他对老师丢石头

241
00:20:33,067 --> 00:20:37,163
十五岁时进感化院 因为他偷了一部车子

242
00:20:37,338 --> 00:20:39,636
他曾因抢劫被捕

243
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:45,040
还曾因持刀械斗被抓过两次 他的确是个用刀高手

244
00:20:45,213 --> 00:20:46,874
他的确是个好孩子

245
00:20:47,048 --> 00:20:51,542
从五岁开始 他老爸就会对他饱以老拳

246
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:53,949
有那种孩子我也会那么做....

247
00:20:54,122 --> 00:20:58,252
现在的孩子 都是那个样子

248
00:20:59,961 --> 00:21:04,955
我小时候 都会叫我爸爸“父亲大人”

249
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:10,196
- 现在哪个孩子会那样叫老爸？ - 现在的爸爸也不在乎

250
00:21:10,371 --> 00:21:12,965
- 你有孩子吗？ - 我有三个小孩

251
00:21:13,908 --> 00:21:15,500
我有一个儿子

252
00:21:16,844 --> 00:21:19,369
他今年二十二岁了

253
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:28,419
他九岁大时 因为打输别人逃之夭夭

254
00:21:29,057 --> 00:21:33,153
我目睹那一幕觉得丢脸丢到家了 我差点没有吐出来

255
00:21:34,162 --> 00:21:39,691
我说“我要让你变成一个男子汉 就算我得磨掉你的小命”

256
00:21:41,102 --> 00:21:46,870
我的确让他变成一个男子汉 他十六岁时我们打了一架

257
00:21:47,542 --> 00:21:51,103
他打中了我的下巴 我儿子非常高大

258
00:21:53,548 --> 00:21:56,312
我两年没有见到他

259
00:21:58,786 --> 00:22:00,413
现在的孩子

260
00:22:01,389 --> 00:22:03,949
总是让父母伤透了心....

261
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,589
- 我们继续吧 - 我想我们忘了真正的重点

262
00:22:09,764 --> 00:22:14,292
他来自破碎家庭，住在贫民窟 关于那一点我们爱莫能助

263
00:22:14,469 --> 00:22:19,771
我们要决定他到底有没有罪 这跟他的成长背景无关

264
00:22:19,941 --> 00:22:24,537
他生于贫民窟，那是犯罪的温床 我们都知道这一点

265
00:22:24,712 --> 00:22:29,445
那不是秘密，来自贫民窟的孩子 出了社会很可能会变成恶棍

266
00:22:29,617 --> 00:22:31,778
- 现在我- -  - 你可以再说一次

267
00:22:31,953 --> 00:22:36,322
来自那种地方的孩子都是垃圾 我不想跟他们被归为同类

268
00:22:36,491 --> 00:22:39,949
听我说 我一直都住在贫民窟里

269
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,755
- 等一下 - 拜托

270
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:44,762
我小时候在塞满垃圾的 后院里玩耍

271
00:22:44,932 --> 00:22:47,628
- 你还可以在我身上闻到臭味 - 听我说

272
00:22:47,802 --> 00:22:50,703
- 这件事无关私人恩怨 - 我觉得有关

273
00:22:50,872 --> 00:22:53,864
他说的人不是你 别那么敏感

274
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:58,444
- 我能瞭解那样的感觉 - 好了，大家别吵了

275
00:22:58,613 --> 00:23:04,415
我们只是在浪费时间 现在轮到你了，说吧

276
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:09,319
我还以为你们想要说服我 那不是你们的原意吗？

277
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,321
- 一点都没错 - 我忘了

278
00:23:11,492 --> 00:23:15,121
是他害得我们被困在这里 我们听听他的说法吧

279
00:23:15,296 --> 00:23:19,164
既然我们已经决定好要这么做 我们应该要坚持下去

280
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:22,063
- 别孩子气了 - 你是什么意思？“孩子气”

281
00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:26,036
你听不懂我的意思吗？ 孩- 子- 气

282
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:31,271
我只是想有条不紊地 把事情办完

283
00:23:31,445 --> 00:23:35,381
只要你愿意接下这份工作 我可以把嘴巴闭上

284
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,814
你为什么要那么生气？冷静点

285
00:23:37,985 --> 00:23:41,113
别叫我冷静 快来主持会议

286
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:43,621
你们看过这种事吗？

287
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:47,249
- 你觉得很有趣吗？ - 算了吧，那一点都不重要

288
00:23:47,428 --> 00:23:50,795
- 不重要？你来试试看 - 不，大家都不想改变现状

289
00:23:50,965 --> 00:23:55,402
- 你做的非常好，请坐 - 对，你表现的很好

290
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,868
你仍然是会议的主持人

291
00:23:58,272 --> 00:24:01,241
好吧，我们来听听别人的说法

292
00:24:01,876 --> 00:24:06,040
如果你们要我说出我的感觉 我一点都不在意

293
00:24:06,214 --> 00:24:08,182
天啊，我不在乎你做了什么

294
00:24:08,349 --> 00:24:13,286
好吧，我没有任何的至理名言 我知道的事跟你们一样多

295
00:24:13,454 --> 00:24:17,151
根据证词，那孩子是有罪的 或许人真的是他杀的

296
00:24:17,325 --> 00:24:21,887
六天来我坐在法庭上 听到目击者接连不断提出证词

297
00:24:22,063 --> 00:24:26,693
大家的语气都十分肯定 对于这次审判我有很特别的感觉

298
00:24:26,867 --> 00:24:31,167
话不要说的太硬了 我想要提出一些问题

299
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:33,500
或许它们毫无意义

300
00:24:33,674 --> 00:24:39,078
但我觉得被告 并没有做过完整的交叉讯问

301
00:24:39,247 --> 00:24:42,842
- 他遗漏了一些小细节 - 什么小细节？

302
00:24:43,017 --> 00:24:47,511
律师不提出问题 是因为他们已经知道了答案

303
00:24:47,688 --> 00:24:51,317
也很可能是因为 那个律师是大笨蛋，对吧？

304
00:24:51,492 --> 00:24:56,156
- 那是有可能的 - 听起来你已经见过我大舅子了

305
00:24:57,531 --> 00:25:01,023
我一直让自己 站在那孩子的角度来想

306
00:25:01,736 --> 00:25:06,639
我会去请另一个律师来帮我辩护 这场审判攸关我的生死...

307
00:25:06,807 --> 00:25:11,471
我会希望我的律师反驳 目击者的证词，至少他该试试看

308
00:25:11,646 --> 00:25:15,742
听着，这件凶案 有一个目击证人

309
00:25:15,916 --> 00:25:19,716
还有一个人听到凶案发生过程 事后还看到那孩子冲出屋外...

310
00:25:19,887 --> 00:25:22,378
同时还出现了 间接证据

311
00:25:22,556 --> 00:25:27,050
这个案子有两个证人 如果他们都错了呢？

312
00:25:27,228 --> 00:25:30,959
你是什么意思？ 那不是证人的责任吗？

313
00:25:31,132 --> 00:25:32,690
如果他们错了呢？

314
00:25:32,867 --> 00:25:35,427
他们在坐上证人席前 都发过了誓

315
00:25:35,603 --> 00:25:39,403
他们只是人，人难免会犯错 如果他们都错了呢？

316
00:25:39,573 --> 00:25:42,406
- 不，我不那么认为 - 你真的那么想吗？

317
00:25:42,576 --> 00:25:46,034
没有人可以确定那一点 我们又不是在做科学论证

318
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:52,820
没错，你说的对

319
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:58,622
现在来谈正事，插在死者胸口的 摺叠刀又是怎么一回事？

320
00:25:58,793 --> 00:26:00,954
等一下，有人还没有发言

321
00:26:01,128 --> 00:26:05,155
- 我们不该照顺序来吗？ - 大家都会有机会说话，安静

322
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:11,465
那孩子承认当晚他买了这把刀 又是怎么一回事？我们来谈谈吧

323
00:26:11,639 --> 00:26:14,870
好吧，我们来谈一谈 现在来看看那把凶刀

324
00:26:15,042 --> 00:26:17,567
- 团长先生 - 我们都看过凶刀

325
00:26:17,745 --> 00:26:22,307
- 为什么还要再看一次呢？ - 他有权利要求审视证物

326
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:26,215
- 麻烦你把凶刀拿过来 - 没问题

327
00:26:28,155 --> 00:26:31,420
凶刀是一项强而有力的证据 你不那么认为吗？

328
00:26:31,592 --> 00:26:33,059
- 你说的一点都没错 - 很好

329
00:26:33,227 --> 00:26:35,787
我们得一样样地 来检视所有的事实

330
00:26:35,963 --> 00:26:41,401
一，那孩子在八点钟离开家里 因为他父亲打了他两巴掌

331
00:26:41,569 --> 00:26:46,165
不，他没说他被“打巴掌” 他说“他被揍”，那是不一样的

332
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:49,070
他长期受到父亲的殴打

333
00:26:49,243 --> 00:26:53,009
二，他跑到附近的二手货店 买了一把....

334
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,546
- 摺叠刀 - 摺叠刀

335
00:26:55,716 --> 00:27:00,449
这不是一把普通的刀子，刀柄上 刻了漂亮的图案，刀锋与众不同

336
00:27:00,621 --> 00:27:05,081
店主说他的店里只有一把这样的刀子

337
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:10,356
三，八点四十五分左右 他在酒吧前遇到一些朋友，对吧？

338
00:27:10,531 --> 00:27:12,624
- 你说的对 - 一点都没错

339
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,894
他跟朋友一起聊天 在九点四十五分时离开

340
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:18,971
在这段时间里 他的朋友看到了摺叠刀

341
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:25,568
四，他们在法庭指认那把刀子 就是凶手使用的凶刀

342
00:27:25,746 --> 00:27:28,613
五，大约十点时他回到家里

343
00:27:28,783 --> 00:27:33,152
从此原告律师跟被告的说词 开始出现分歧

344
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,811
被告说他在十一点三十分时 出门去看电影...

345
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:40,188
凌晨三点十分回到家发现 父亲已经死了，他遭到逮捕

346
00:27:40,361 --> 00:27:44,627
他还说逮捕他的两名警官 将他丢下楼梯

347
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:49,600
那把刀子又是怎么一回事？ 他说刀子从口袋的破洞掉了出去...

348
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:54,070
约在十一点半到三点十分之间 之后他再也没有看到那把刀子

349
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:59,269
他根本在说谎，事实非常明显 那孩子没有去看电影

350
00:27:59,447 --> 00:28:03,349
没有人看到他十一点半时离家 电影院里有没有人见过他

351
00:28:03,517 --> 00:28:06,452
他完全不记得 那部电影的名字

352
00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:11,452
真正的事实是 那孩子一直待在家里

353
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:16,961
他跟父亲发生争执 他杀了父亲，在十二点十分离家

354
00:28:17,131 --> 00:28:20,100
他甚至还把刀子的指纹 擦的一干二净

355
00:28:20,267 --> 00:28:24,795
你说这把刀子 从那孩子口袋的破洞掉出来

356
00:28:24,972 --> 00:28:28,738
有人捡起它，跑到他家 用它杀死他父亲...

357
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:30,206
只为了测试刀子锐不锐利？

358
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:35,815
很可能是他的刀子不见了 有人用类似的刀子杀了他父亲

359
00:28:35,983 --> 00:28:37,814
请看看这把刀子

360
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,311
它是一把与众不同的刀子

361
00:28:41,489 --> 00:28:45,983
我从来没有看过这样的刀子 卖出它的店主也那么说

362
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,856
这未免太巧了吧？

363
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:52,859
- 我的意思是或许就是这么巧 - 我可不那么认为

364
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,603
- 你从哪里弄来那个玩意？ - 这把刀子跟凶刀完全一样

365
00:29:02,777 --> 00:29:06,269
- 你到底在做什么？ - 你去哪里拿到那把刀子？

366
00:29:06,447 --> 00:29:10,577
我昨天晚上出去散步 刚好经过那孩子住的社区

367
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:15,745
我在离那孩子家两条街远的当铺 买下它，只花了我六块钱

368
00:29:15,923 --> 00:29:18,790
买卖摺叠刀是违法的

369
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:22,292
- 我犯了法 - 你这招真的是太妙了

370
00:29:22,463 --> 00:29:26,991
那能证明什么，或许还有十把 类似凶刀的刀子，那又怎么样？

371
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,659
- 或许是有 - 那是什么意思？

372
00:29:29,837 --> 00:29:33,034
你找到一把类似的刀子 那是了不起的大发现吗？

373
00:29:33,207 --> 00:29:37,337
我们得相信有人 拿类似的刀子杀了他父亲？

374
00:29:37,545 --> 00:29:40,446
- 机率只有百万分之一 - 那是有可能的

375
00:29:40,614 --> 00:29:42,741
但可能性不是很大

376
00:29:42,917 --> 00:29:48,150
好吧，大家请坐下 我们不必站着说话....

377
00:29:48,389 --> 00:29:51,984
他能找到类似凶刀的刀子 真的是太有趣了

378
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:56,653
- 哪里很有趣了？ - 我不知道，我就是觉得有趣

379
00:29:56,831 --> 00:29:59,322
我们十一个人 都认为他有罪

380
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,958
你到底想做什么？ 你无法改变我们的想法

381
00:30:03,137 --> 00:30:09,474
就算你坚持到底 他还是会被判有罪

382
00:30:10,277 --> 00:30:13,678
- 或许你说的对 - 你打算要怎么做呢？

383
00:30:13,848 --> 00:30:18,547
- 我们可能一整晚都会耗在这里 - 只是一夜，可是那孩子会没命的

384
00:30:18,719 --> 00:30:21,313
我们为什么不干脆在这里扎营？

385
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:27,654
去跟那个警察说他可以休息了 我们会在这里耗上一阵子

386
00:30:27,828 --> 00:30:31,423
- 他不该拿这件事开玩笑 - 你要我怎么做？

387
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:36,366
这跟那把刀子有什么关系？ 有人目睹那孩子杀了自己的父亲

388
00:30:36,537 --> 00:30:40,667
你还需要什么证据？ 我真的不想再听你们废话了

389
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:45,278
我还要跑三家修车厂 赶快把事情办好离开这里吧

390
00:30:45,446 --> 00:30:49,212
对检察官来说那把刀子很重要 他花了- - 

391
00:30:49,383 --> 00:30:55,754
- 他只是个小角色，他懂什么？ - 我们把时间浪费在争吵上

392
00:30:57,992 --> 00:31:01,393
怎么样呢？ 只有你认为他无罪

393
00:31:08,736 --> 00:31:14,333
我要提出一项建议 我们何不再投一次票

394
00:31:15,142 --> 00:31:20,307
我要你们十一个人 以书面的方式来做秘密投票

395
00:31:20,481 --> 00:31:25,418
我弃权，如果你们全都 认为他“有罪”，我会赞同你们

396
00:31:25,586 --> 00:31:29,113
我们可以立刻向法官 提出有罪的判决

397
00:31:30,624 --> 00:31:35,425
但只要有人做出“无罪”的判决 我们就得待在这里把事情弄清楚

398
00:31:37,865 --> 00:31:42,029
- 如果你们愿意，我准备好了 - 让我们再度受苦吧

399
00:31:42,202 --> 00:31:45,968
听起来很公平，大家都同意吗？ 有人反对吗？

400
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:49,940
- 好了，请帮忙传下去 - 那个时钟准吗？

401
00:32:21,475 --> 00:32:22,772
“有罪”

402
00:32:25,346 --> 00:32:26,608
“有罪”

403
00:32:28,682 --> 00:32:30,047
“有罪”

404
00:32:32,252 --> 00:32:33,651
“有罪”

405
00:32:34,888 --> 00:32:36,150
“有罪”

406
00:32:38,025 --> 00:32:39,322
“有罪”

407
00:32:41,228 --> 00:32:42,525
“有罪”

408
00:32:43,597 --> 00:32:44,894
“有罪”

409
00:32:45,933 --> 00:32:47,332
“有罪”

410
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:53,363
“无罪”

411
00:32:53,874 --> 00:32:55,205
“有罪”

412
00:32:55,376 --> 00:32:59,836
- 天啊，怎么会这样？ - 又有一个混蛋在搞破坏

413
00:33:00,014 --> 00:33:02,608
好了，是谁干的？我想要知道

414
00:33:02,783 --> 00:33:06,583
对不起，这是秘密投票 大家都说好了

415
00:33:06,754 --> 00:33:10,850
- 如果他不想被公开- -  - 你是什么意思？“秘密”

416
00:33:11,025 --> 00:33:14,620
陪审团室里没有任何秘密 我知道是谁干的

417
00:33:14,795 --> 00:33:16,524
你真的是很厉害

418
00:33:16,697 --> 00:33:22,397
你坐在这里投票认为他“有罪” 那家伙的胡言乱语说动了你...

419
00:33:22,569 --> 00:33:27,438
他认为那孩子不可能杀人 于是你改变了心意

420
00:33:27,608 --> 00:33:29,337
那真的太- - 

421
00:33:29,476 --> 00:33:32,934
你为什么不丢些铜板 到他的破碗去呢？

422
00:33:33,113 --> 00:33:36,844
等一下 你不能那样子跟我说话

423
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:39,884
- 你以为你是什么东西？ - 冷静点

424
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,279
他太激动了，快坐下

425
00:33:42,456 --> 00:33:47,450
我当然很激动，我们要把 一个罪有应得的家伙送上电椅

426
00:33:47,628 --> 00:33:50,153
他满口胡言乱语，我们相信了

427
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:52,093
少来了

428
00:33:52,266 --> 00:33:57,033
- 你为什么要改变心意？ - 改变心意的人不是他，是我

429
00:33:57,838 --> 00:33:59,169
- 太棒了 - 我就知道

430
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:03,344
- 你要我告诉你为什么吗？ - 我不想听

431
00:34:03,344 --> 00:34:07,508
- 我想把话说清楚 - 我们非得听这些废话不可吗？

432
00:34:07,682 --> 00:34:10,708
- 他有话想说 - 谢谢你

433
00:34:10,885 --> 00:34:14,218
这位先生一直孤军奋战地 跟我们对抗

434
00:34:14,388 --> 00:34:18,620
他并没有说那孩子无罪 他只是说他无法确定他有罪

435
00:34:18,793 --> 00:34:21,591
要孤军奋战对抗荒谬的言论 并不容易

436
00:34:21,762 --> 00:34:26,461
所以他孤注一掷争取支持 我支持他因为我赞同他的动机

437
00:34:26,634 --> 00:34:29,228
那个孩子或许真的杀了人

438
00:34:29,403 --> 00:34:33,032
但我想听到更多的证词 现在的票数是十比二

439
00:34:33,207 --> 00:34:36,574
- 你没有权利离开- -  - 他不会听你说话

440
00:34:36,744 --> 00:34:39,406
他死都不会听的，我们坐下吧

441
00:34:43,651 --> 00:34:45,346
可以继续了吗？

442
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:47,612
我觉得我们应该休息一下

443
00:34:47,788 --> 00:34:53,693
有人进了洗手间 我觉得我们应该等他

444
00:34:55,062 --> 00:34:57,690
看来我们真的被困在这里了

445
00:34:58,232 --> 00:35:01,531
那老头会做出那种事 真是令人意想不到

446
00:35:02,637 --> 00:35:06,129
真希望我能想出办法 突破这个困局

447
00:35:07,842 --> 00:35:12,108
你知道吗？在广告界- -  我提过我在广告公司工作吗？

448
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,010
有一些怪人在那里工作

449
00:35:15,182 --> 00:35:20,711
我觉得他们一点都不奇怪 只是他们表达自己的方式很特别

450
00:35:20,888 --> 00:35:23,880
我猜在你那一行 也是一样的吧？

451
00:35:24,058 --> 00:35:26,549
- 你是做哪一行的？ - 我是个钟表匠

452
00:35:26,727 --> 00:35:30,993
真的吗？ 我以为最棒的钟表匠都在欧洲

453
00:35:31,165 --> 00:35:34,134
在公司里 要是遇到这种情形- - 

454
00:35:34,302 --> 00:35:37,829
在广告公司里 要是遇到这种情形...

455
00:35:38,005 --> 00:35:42,533
总会有人想出妙点子来 我真的都快笑死了....

456
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:47,443
那真的很奇怪，他们总是 用一句话来说出自己的心声

457
00:35:47,615 --> 00:35:52,348
总会有个广告业务人员站起来说 好了，我想到一个点子

458
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:57,253
我们把它升上旗杆 看看会不会有人向它敬礼

459
00:35:57,425 --> 00:35:59,393
虽然挺蠢的，但很好笑

460
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,357
嘿...

461
00:36:01,529 --> 00:36:04,828
我刚刚太激动了一点

462
00:36:05,032 --> 00:36:07,557
我无意要为难大家

463
00:36:07,735 --> 00:36:12,604
还好你不是那一种 会被情绪影响的人

464
00:36:27,655 --> 00:36:30,749
我不知道 那个电扇到底是哪里有问题

465
00:36:40,568 --> 00:36:45,096
- 你是业务员吗？ - 我是建筑师

466
00:36:46,674 --> 00:36:49,165
你知道什么叫做“软性推销”？

467
00:36:51,746 --> 00:36:55,204
你有这个技能，相信我

468
00:36:55,383 --> 00:36:57,715
我用的技巧跟别人不一样

469
00:36:57,885 --> 00:37:02,515
说说笑话，陪客人喝几杯 耍耍小手段，你懂吧？

470
00:37:02,857 --> 00:37:04,688
我懂

471
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:08,790
抓住他们生活的脉动 那就是我的名言

472
00:37:09,163 --> 00:37:13,395
去年我靠卖橘皮果酱 赚了两万七，成绩还不错

473
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:16,434
毕竟我卖的 可是橘皮果酱

474
00:37:18,572 --> 00:37:21,370
待在这里能得到什么好处？ 刺激吗？

475
00:37:21,776 --> 00:37:25,735
难不成有人撞到你的头 你到现在还耿耿于怀吗？

476
00:37:25,913 --> 00:37:30,282
- 或许是吧 - 你们全都是不切实际的家伙

477
00:37:30,451 --> 00:37:34,353
老是把自己的快乐 建立在别人的痛苦上

478
00:37:36,123 --> 00:37:38,717
你为什么 要浪费我们的时间？

479
00:37:38,893 --> 00:37:43,762
捐点钱做好事 或许能让你觉得舒服点

480
00:37:46,133 --> 00:37:50,695
这个孩子有罪 那简直是再明显不过了

481
00:37:50,871 --> 00:37:53,271
我们为什么还要继续浪费时间？

482
00:37:53,441 --> 00:37:56,069
吵到最后大家的喉咙都痛了

483
00:37:56,243 --> 00:38:00,009
你被困在这里或是去看球赛 那又有什么差别呢？

484
00:38:00,181 --> 00:38:05,175
没有差别，兄弟 完全没有差别

485
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:21,467
- 他们还挺不错的，对吧？ - 他们跟其他人都一样

486
00:38:21,635 --> 00:38:26,538
天啊，今天真的是够惨的了 你觉得这样还会继续很久吗？

487
00:38:26,707 --> 00:38:28,368
我不知道

488
00:38:28,542 --> 00:38:32,000
他绝对有罪 全世界没有一个人会怀疑

489
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:34,875
我们早该做出裁决

490
00:38:36,717 --> 00:38:41,313
我并不介意，这比上班好玩多了

491
00:38:47,628 --> 00:38:52,292
- 你认为他无罪，对吧？ - 我不知道，或许是吧

492
00:38:52,466 --> 00:38:56,232
我不认识你 但我很肯定你从未犯过错

493
00:38:56,403 --> 00:38:58,769
你是在浪费你的时间

494
00:38:58,939 --> 00:39:01,703
如果接受审判的人是你自己呢？

495
00:39:01,876 --> 00:39:04,367
我不想回答假设性的问题

496
00:39:04,545 --> 00:39:08,037
我只是一个上班族 要动脑筋的人是我老板...

497
00:39:08,215 --> 00:39:09,739
但我会试试看的

498
00:39:10,918 --> 00:39:14,081
假设你真的可以 说服我们每一个人...

499
00:39:14,255 --> 00:39:17,622
但那孩子真的拿刀子 杀了他父亲呢？

500
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:27,198
准备好了吗？

501
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,568
对不起，大帅哥

502
00:39:32,006 --> 00:39:35,066
- 随便挑一个 - 好了，大家坐下吧

503
00:39:35,242 --> 00:39:37,301
看来我们得留在这里吃晚餐

504
00:39:37,478 --> 00:39:40,970
好了，快点来谈正式 谁想第一个发言？

505
00:39:41,148 --> 00:39:42,581
- 我有话要说 - 请说

506
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:47,187
听着，住在凶案现场楼下的老头 说他听到那孩子大叫着

507
00:39:47,354 --> 00:39:51,313
“我要杀了你” 一秒后他听到有人摔倒的声音

508
00:39:51,492 --> 00:39:54,757
他跑到门口 看到那孩子夺门而出

509
00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:56,692
你们想到了什么呢？

510
00:39:56,864 --> 00:40:00,322
隔了一层天花板 他能听得多清楚呢？

511
00:40:00,501 --> 00:40:04,460
他并非透过天花板听到争吵声 那时窗户是打开的

512
00:40:04,638 --> 00:40:09,837
- 要听清楚对方的声音并不容易 - 他在庭上指认出那孩子的声音

513
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:14,447
别忘了住在对街的女士 她看到那孩子拿刀刺死他父亲

514
00:40:14,615 --> 00:40:17,243
- 难道对你来说这还不够吗？ - 的确是不够

515
00:40:17,418 --> 00:40:20,876
这简直就是在对牛弹琴

516
00:40:21,055 --> 00:40:24,286
她是透过电车的车窗 看到凶案发生的经过

517
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:28,326
电车一共有六节车厢，她透过 最后两节车厢目睹凶案经过

518
00:40:28,495 --> 00:40:31,987
她记得所有的细节 那是无庸置疑的证据

519
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:37,297
你们曾经想过 电车要花多少时间- - ？

520
00:40:46,847 --> 00:40:48,542
这不是在玩游戏

521
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,821
你看到了吗？他胆子真大

522
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:58,185
- 听我说- -  - 他简直是胆大包天

523
00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:01,556
- 好了，别这样 - 这不是在玩游戏吗？

524
00:41:01,729 --> 00:41:04,220
- 冷静点 - 他以为他是什么东西？

525
00:41:04,398 --> 00:41:05,660
别闹了

526
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:11,271
你们曾经想过电车要花多少时间 才能完全通过某一点吗？

527
00:41:11,271 --> 00:41:15,469
- 我不知道 - 你觉得呢？

528
00:41:15,642 --> 00:41:18,338
我不知道，或许十到十二秒吧

529
00:41:18,512 --> 00:41:20,173
很不错，其他人呢？

530
00:41:20,347 --> 00:41:22,975
- 他说的有道理 - 我们为什么要玩猜谜游戏？

531
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,913
- 你觉得呢？ - 十秒钟吧

532
00:41:25,085 --> 00:41:28,145
好吧，假设真的是十秒钟 你想表达什么呢？

533
00:41:28,321 --> 00:41:32,121
有六节车厢的电车 要花十秒钟才能通过某一个点

534
00:41:32,292 --> 00:41:36,456
假设那一点就是 发生凶案的房间窗口

535
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:39,793
在那里一伸手 几乎就可以摸到铁轨

536
00:41:39,966 --> 00:41:43,766
我要问你们一个问题 你们之中有人曾住在铁轨旁边吗？

537
00:41:43,937 --> 00:41:47,668
我刚油漆完一间 可以俯视电车线的公寓

538
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:49,672
- 那是什么样的感觉呢？ - 你是什么意思？

539
00:41:49,843 --> 00:41:51,674
- 很吵吗？ - 天啊

540
00:41:51,845 --> 00:41:55,781
- 那不重要，因为大家都昏沉沉的 - 我曾经住在电车线附近

541
00:41:55,949 --> 00:41:58,884
只要有电车通过 噪音大到令人难以忍受

542
00:41:59,052 --> 00:42:02,715
- 甚至吵得你无法思考 - 请你说重点

543
00:42:02,889 --> 00:42:04,356
我会的，稍安勿躁

544
00:42:04,524 --> 00:42:08,016
请回想一下两个证人的证词 把它们拼凑在一起

545
00:42:08,195 --> 00:42:11,961
首先是住在 楼下公寓的老人

546
00:42:12,132 --> 00:42:15,431
他听到那孩子说 “我要杀了你”...

547
00:42:15,602 --> 00:42:18,799
一秒后他听到 有人摔倒在地的声音

548
00:42:18,972 --> 00:42:20,872
- 没错 - 第二点...

549
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:25,444
那女人发誓说 当她从窗户往外看时...

550
00:42:25,612 --> 00:42:29,878
她透过电车最后两节车厢 看到凶案发生的经过

551
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:32,644
- 你到底想说什么？ - 等一下

552
00:42:32,819 --> 00:42:37,916
我们都同意电车得花十秒钟 才能完全通过某一点

553
00:42:38,091 --> 00:42:41,322
因为她是透过最后两节车厢 看到凶案发生的经过...

554
00:42:41,494 --> 00:42:46,557
我们可以推测出 死者是在电车经过时倒在地上

555
00:42:46,733 --> 00:42:50,999
因此电车经过老人家窗口时 发出轰隆隆的噪音...

556
00:42:51,171 --> 00:42:54,572
过了十秒后 死者倒在地上

557
00:42:54,741 --> 00:42:57,574
他说他听到被告说“我要杀了你”

558
00:42:57,744 --> 00:42:59,939
一秒后听到有人跌在地上...

559
00:43:00,113 --> 00:43:04,209
所以他听到那孩子说话的同时 电车刚好经过他家窗口

560
00:43:04,384 --> 00:43:07,285
- 他不可能听得到 - 他真的听到了

561
00:43:07,454 --> 00:43:10,582
- 你相信他的说法？ - 那孩子是扯着喉咙大叫

562
00:43:10,757 --> 00:43:13,954
当时刚好有电车通过 他不可能认得出那孩子的声音

563
00:43:14,127 --> 00:43:16,960
这是在几秒内发生的事 没有人可以测量的那么准确

564
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:22,397
我认为能送那孩子上电椅的证词 必须非常准确才行

565
00:43:23,737 --> 00:43:27,969
- 我认为他根本就听不出来 - 或许那么吵他真的听不出来

566
00:43:28,141 --> 00:43:29,972
你在胡说什么？

567
00:43:30,143 --> 00:43:34,204
- 他的确可能会听不清楚 - 他为什么要说谎？

568
00:43:34,714 --> 00:43:36,341
或许他想引起别人的注意

569
00:43:36,516 --> 00:43:39,679
你既然想出这么多理论 把它们卖给报社吧

570
00:43:39,853 --> 00:43:44,620
- 一份稿费是三块钱 - 你为什么要那样子对他说话？

571
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:48,557
会那样子跟老人说话的人 应该要受到谴责

572
00:43:48,728 --> 00:43:51,162
你得学着去尊敬别人，先生

573
00:43:51,364 --> 00:43:56,734
你敢再那样子跟他说话 我一定会给你好看

574
00:44:06,046 --> 00:44:09,675
好了 你想说什么就说吧

575
00:44:09,849 --> 00:44:12,818
你觉得那个老人 为什么要说谎呢？

576
00:44:12,986 --> 00:44:16,945
我在法庭上 一直盯着他看

577
00:44:17,123 --> 00:44:20,286
他穿的外套 在肩膀的部份裂开了

578
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:25,193
你们注意到了吗？ 我是说他上法庭却穿成那个样子

579
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:31,331
他是个穿着破外套的老头子

580
00:44:31,504 --> 00:44:34,905
而且他走上证人席的步伐缓慢

581
00:44:35,075 --> 00:44:39,034
他的左脚一跛一跛的 却努力地想要掩饰它...

582
00:44:39,212 --> 00:44:41,840
因为他觉得自己很丢脸

583
00:44:42,015 --> 00:44:46,042
我认为我比你们任何一个人 都瞭解那个老头子

584
00:44:46,219 --> 00:44:50,622
他是个安静，怯懦 不起眼的老头子...

585
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:54,282
一辈子无所成

586
00:44:54,461 --> 00:44:59,398
没有人认得他 他的名字也没有上过报

587
00:44:59,566 --> 00:45:03,832
没有人认得他，也不会听他说话

588
00:45:04,003 --> 00:45:08,565
七十五年来 没有人征询过他的意见

589
00:45:08,742 --> 00:45:13,236
各位，默默无闻 是一件令人伤感的事

590
00:45:13,413 --> 00:45:15,904
像他那样的人 会希望别人去询问他的意见

591
00:45:16,082 --> 00:45:22,453
有人会听他说话，询问他的意见 即使只有一次对他来说都很重要

592
00:45:22,622 --> 00:45:25,455
要他放弃这个机会 真的很难- - 

593
00:45:25,625 --> 00:45:29,493
你的意思是他说谎 只为了体会当大人物的滋味

594
00:45:29,662 --> 00:45:32,529
不，事实上他不算是说谎

595
00:45:32,699 --> 00:45:38,399
或许他幻想他真的听到那些话 认为凶手就是那个男孩

596
00:45:38,571 --> 00:45:40,835
这个说法太妙了

597
00:45:41,007 --> 00:45:45,103
你怎么编得出这样的故事 你又知道多少呢？

598
00:45:52,919 --> 00:45:54,944
谁想吃喉糖？

599
00:45:55,121 --> 00:45:57,146
- 我不要，谢谢 - 给我一颗吧

600
00:45:57,323 --> 00:46:00,918
我还是不明白 你们为什么会认为他无罪

601
00:46:01,094 --> 00:46:05,121
还有一件事 我想跟你们讨论一下

602
00:46:05,298 --> 00:46:08,927
我们证明了那老头听不到 那孩子说“我要杀了你”

603
00:46:09,102 --> 00:46:13,095
- 你根本没有证明任何事 - 假设他真的听到了

604
00:46:13,273 --> 00:46:17,107
你们有多常说这句话呢？ 应该超过好几千次吧

605
00:46:17,277 --> 00:46:22,305
- 你根本没有证明任何事 - 假设他真的听到了

606
00:46:22,482 --> 00:46:26,077
- 那不代表我们真的要- -  - 你到底想做什么？

607
00:46:26,252 --> 00:46:30,780
他说“我要杀了你” 别告诉我他不是这个意思

608
00:46:30,957 --> 00:46:33,892
任何人像他那样说话 都是认真的

609
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:35,652
天啊，现在我真的不知道了

610
00:46:35,829 --> 00:46:39,196
几个星期前 我跟一位工作夥伴发生争执

611
00:46:39,365 --> 00:46:41,959
他骂我是白痴 于是我对他破口大骂

612
00:46:42,135 --> 00:46:45,298
他要你们去相信他编的故事

613
00:46:45,472 --> 00:46:47,133
被告放话要杀人，他真的动手了

614
00:46:47,307 --> 00:46:51,971
那孩子如果真的想杀人 他会到处嚷嚷让邻居知道吗？

615
00:46:52,145 --> 00:46:53,976
他太聪明了

616
00:46:54,147 --> 00:46:58,846
聪明？他只是个不学无术的混混一般的 他连英语都说不好

617
00:46:59,018 --> 00:47:02,579
甚至连正确的语法都不会

618
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:08,559
团长先生，我改变了心意 那个孩子应该是“无罪”

619
00:47:08,728 --> 00:47:10,696
- 你说什么？ - 你都听到了

620
00:47:10,864 --> 00:47:14,300
- 你确定？ - 我非常确定

621
00:47:14,467 --> 00:47:16,992
九比三，有罪那一方占优势

622
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:20,833
但这还不是最后的结论，对吧

623
00:47:23,743 --> 00:47:27,201
你为什么会相信 这个家伙编出来的故事？

624
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:31,441
你应该去写侦探小说 你一定可以大赚一票的

625
00:47:31,618 --> 00:47:35,179
连那孩子的律师都知道 他根本没有胜诉的机会

626
00:47:35,355 --> 00:47:38,688
从一开始 他的律师就知道了

627
00:47:38,858 --> 00:47:43,227
天啊，听我说 这个家伙真的很厉害

628
00:47:43,396 --> 00:47:46,126
那孩子请了律师 应该由他来帮他打官司

629
00:47:46,299 --> 00:47:49,894
- 为什么你有那么多的话可说？ - 律师的话并不完全是正确的

630
00:47:50,069 --> 00:47:53,561
- 他是法庭指派的律师 - 那是什么意思？

631
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:56,231
他很可能 并不想出庭打这场官司...

632
00:47:56,409 --> 00:47:59,640
虽然他真的出庭了 从这个案子他捞不到任何好处

633
00:47:59,812 --> 00:48:03,043
赚不到钱，得不到名声 连胜诉的机会都是微乎其微

634
00:48:03,216 --> 00:48:06,185
对一位年轻律师来说 这不是一个好案子

635
00:48:06,352 --> 00:48:11,153
他得去相信他的客户是无罪的 但他并没有那么做

636
00:48:11,324 --> 00:48:16,489
他当然不会那么做 谁会那么做呢？

637
00:48:16,663 --> 00:48:19,427
或许某人的妈妈 或是某个人....

638
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,727
听我说，现在已经很晚了 别再耗下去了

639
00:48:22,902 --> 00:48:26,838
对不起 我做了一些笔记...

640
00:48:27,006 --> 00:48:29,736
我有一些话 想要告诉你们

641
00:48:29,909 --> 00:48:32,309
我一直非常仔细地 在听证人陈述证词...

642
00:48:32,478 --> 00:48:36,471
看起来这位先生 说的话非常有道理

643
00:48:36,649 --> 00:48:41,643
从法庭上的证词看来 这孩子似乎是有罪

644
00:48:41,821 --> 00:48:45,257
- 如果我们深入去- -  - 少来了

645
00:48:45,425 --> 00:48:47,655
我有一个问题

646
00:48:47,827 --> 00:48:51,092
假设那个孩子 真的杀了人

647
00:48:51,264 --> 00:48:54,529
案发的时间 是十二点十分

648
00:48:54,701 --> 00:48:57,067
他是如何被警方逮捕的呢？

649
00:48:57,236 --> 00:49:01,605
他是在三点左右 回到家里...

650
00:49:01,774 --> 00:49:05,403
在家里 被两名警官逮捕

651
00:49:05,578 --> 00:49:10,072
我的问题是 如果他真的杀了他的父亲...

652
00:49:10,249 --> 00:49:13,480
为什么他会在 三个小时后回到家里？

653
00:49:13,653 --> 00:49:16,417
难道他不怕会被逮到吗？

654
00:49:16,589 --> 00:49:20,753
他是回来拿刀子的，他不想 让刀子继续插在死者胸口上

655
00:49:20,927 --> 00:49:23,589
对，而且死的人是他老爸

656
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:26,033
我一点都不觉得好笑 他知道会有人指认出...

657
00:49:26,033 --> 00:49:27,500
我一点都不觉得好笑 他知道会有人指认出...

658
00:49:27,667 --> 00:49:31,797
那是他的刀子 他得抢在警察前面拿走刀子

659
00:49:31,972 --> 00:49:36,909
如果他知道凶刀会被指认出来 案发时他为什么要把它留在现场？

660
00:49:37,077 --> 00:49:42,140
我们可以假设那孩子杀了父亲后 慌张地逃离现场

661
00:49:42,315 --> 00:49:45,580
他冷静下来后 才发现他把刀子留在现场

662
00:49:45,752 --> 00:49:48,516
这得视你对慌张的定义 来做判断

663
00:49:48,688 --> 00:49:53,387
他必须非常地冷静 才会想到要把刀子的指纹擦干净

664
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:57,553
他什么时候感到慌张 又在什么时候冷静下来的呢？

665
00:49:57,731 --> 00:50:00,495
你投了“有罪”一票 你到底站在哪一边

666
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:05,536
我不必效忠于任何一边 我只是提出了我的疑问

667
00:50:05,705 --> 00:50:08,833
这真的已经超出了我的理解范围 但是....

668
00:50:09,009 --> 00:50:13,343
如果我是他，我真的杀了人 我会回案发现场取回刀子

669
00:50:13,513 --> 00:50:18,780
他认为没有人看到他离开现场 尸体要到隔天才会被发现

670
00:50:18,952 --> 00:50:20,579
那时是三更半夜的

671
00:50:20,754 --> 00:50:25,316
- 他认为没有人会发现尸体 - 对不起，那就是我的重点

672
00:50:25,492 --> 00:50:29,189
那女人在法庭上说 在凶案发生之后- - 

673
00:50:29,362 --> 00:50:31,592
在电车经过后不久...

674
00:50:31,765 --> 00:50:34,928
她放声大叫 并且打电话报警

675
00:50:35,102 --> 00:50:38,435
那个孩子一定 听到了尖叫声

676
00:50:38,605 --> 00:50:42,006
他一定知道 有人看到了他杀人

677
00:50:42,175 --> 00:50:44,871
我想他是打死都不会回家的

678
00:50:45,045 --> 00:50:49,379
或许他太过惊慌没有听到尖叫声 或许她没有叫得很大声

679
00:50:49,549 --> 00:50:52,950
或许他没有想到 她是看到他杀人才会放声大叫

680
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,918
在他住的地方 听见尖叫声是司空见惯的事

681
00:50:56,089 --> 00:50:58,523
- 事情就是那么简单 - 或许是吧

682
00:50:58,692 --> 00:51:02,150
或是他真的杀了他父亲 他没有听到尖叫声...

683
00:51:02,329 --> 00:51:04,991
他慌张地冲出屋子 事后他冷静下来...

684
00:51:05,165 --> 00:51:08,100
冒着被抓的风险 回家去拿他的刀子

685
00:51:08,268 --> 00:51:11,169
或许这就是事实 或许根本不是这么一回事

686
00:51:11,338 --> 00:51:15,274
还有很多疑点能让我们去怀疑 案发时他到底在不在现场

687
00:51:15,442 --> 00:51:18,843
你在胡说什么？ 那个老头子看到他冲出屋外

688
00:51:19,012 --> 00:51:21,037
他是在扭曲事实

689
00:51:21,214 --> 00:51:24,615
十二点十分时 那个老人到底有没有看到被告？

690
00:51:24,784 --> 00:51:27,582
- 他到底有没有看到？ - 他说他看到了

691
00:51:27,754 --> 00:51:31,212
- 他说他看到了 - 听着，证人也是会犯错的

692
00:51:31,391 --> 00:51:34,918
没错，那都是你在胡说八道 他根本没有说谎

693
00:51:35,095 --> 00:51:38,656
- 小声一点 - 或许我们该大声地说出来

694
00:51:38,832 --> 00:51:42,598
这些家伙越来越过份了 他到底听到了尖叫声吗？

695
00:51:42,769 --> 00:51:46,205
你们只会去讨论 那些微乎其微的小细节

696
00:51:46,373 --> 00:51:48,603
却忘了最重要的事

697
00:51:48,775 --> 00:51:50,800
- 我提议再投一次票 - 我在说话吔

698
00:51:50,977 --> 00:51:55,937
有人要求再投一次票 大家请坐下

699
00:51:58,518 --> 00:52:01,146
我从来没看过 有人把时间浪费在这种小事上

700
00:52:01,321 --> 00:52:03,915
只要一下子就好了

701
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:07,548
最快的方法是先表决 “无罪”的部份

702
00:52:07,727 --> 00:52:11,060
要投“无罪”一票的人 请举手

703
00:52:11,431 --> 00:52:15,060
还是一样，三票无罪 九票有罪

704
00:52:15,235 --> 00:52:18,534
听我说，再这样耗下去 我们得在这里待到下星期二

705
00:52:18,705 --> 00:52:20,332
这对我们有什么好处呢？

706
00:52:20,507 --> 00:52:23,840
对不起，我要投“无罪”一票

707
00:52:25,946 --> 00:52:29,643
他在胡说什么？ 大家全都疯了

708
00:52:29,816 --> 00:52:33,582
那个孩子有罪 你们为什么不愿意相信事实？

709
00:52:33,753 --> 00:52:35,846
这个案子会变成一个大笑话

710
00:52:36,022 --> 00:52:39,253
票数是八比四 有罪占优势

711
00:52:39,426 --> 00:52:43,294
这是怎么一回事 “支持弱势团体周”到了吗？

712
00:52:43,463 --> 00:52:47,092
告诉我你为什么会改变心意 把理由给我说清楚

713
00:52:47,267 --> 00:52:51,727
我不必为我的决定辩护 我心里头出现了合理的怀疑

714
00:52:51,905 --> 00:52:54,931
什么怀疑？证词非常明确 听我说

715
00:52:55,108 --> 00:52:59,943
有人看到你认为无罪的那个孩子 拿刀杀了他的父亲

716
00:53:00,113 --> 00:53:05,244
- 那又是怎么一回事？ - 那并不是凶刀，你还记得吗？

717
00:53:05,418 --> 00:53:07,113
太棒了

718
00:53:07,287 --> 00:53:09,380
我得告诉你们这件事太疯狂了

719
00:53:09,556 --> 00:53:14,516
我们到底要相信什么？ 你们凭空编出许多故事

720
00:53:14,794 --> 00:53:18,423
这家伙要是看过 丹柏西跟佛波的比赛...

721
00:53:18,598 --> 00:53:20,930
或许他会告诉你们....

722
00:53:21,101 --> 00:53:25,504
那个老头又是怎么一回事？ 我们要相信他没有跑到门边...

723
00:53:25,672 --> 00:53:29,005
在案发后十五秒 他没有看到那孩子冲出屋外？

724
00:53:29,175 --> 00:53:31,837
他那么说只是想引人注意，对吧？

725
00:53:32,012 --> 00:53:34,173
- 你到底想说什么？ - 等一下

726
00:53:34,347 --> 00:53:38,977
巴尔的摩队的球迷欢声雷动 球员击出安打现场纸花四射

727
00:53:39,152 --> 00:53:41,950
那个老头说 他跑到了门口

728
00:53:42,122 --> 00:53:45,182
他用跑的或用走的又有什么差别 总之他是到了门口

729
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:48,418
- 等一下- -  - 我确定他说他是用跑的

730
00:53:48,595 --> 00:53:51,189
他根本就没办法跑步

731
00:53:51,364 --> 00:53:54,162
他说他从房间 跑到了门口

732
00:53:54,334 --> 00:53:56,495
- 他的房间在哪里？ - 就在走廊的尽头

733
00:53:56,670 --> 00:54:00,128
你记得所有的细节 却不记得那一点？

734
00:54:00,307 --> 00:54:02,867
我是不记得了 我想看看那栋公寓的配置图

735
00:54:03,043 --> 00:54:05,705
我们为什么 不叫他们再开一次庭？

736
00:54:05,879 --> 00:54:07,938
只有你想看公寓的配置图

737
00:54:08,114 --> 00:54:11,106
- 我也想看 - 我不想再浪费时间了

738
00:54:11,284 --> 00:54:14,276
如果我们要把时间 浪费在这些胡言乱语上- - 

739
00:54:14,454 --> 00:54:18,857
这不是在浪费时间，我想要知道 一个跛脚的老人...

740
00:54:19,025 --> 00:54:22,984
能不能在十五秒内 从他的房间跑到门口

741
00:54:23,163 --> 00:54:24,562
- 是二十秒才对 - 他说十五秒

742
00:54:24,731 --> 00:54:26,995
他要二十秒 你为什么要扭曲事实？

743
00:54:27,167 --> 00:54:28,429
他说十五秒

744
00:54:28,601 --> 00:54:31,798
他怎么会知道 十五秒到底是多久？

745
00:54:31,971 --> 00:54:34,303
他说十五秒 他非常肯定

746
00:54:34,474 --> 00:54:37,136
他是个老头子 他的脑袋有一半的时间不太清楚

747
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:39,904
他怎么能那么肯定 他看到的事都是对的？

748
00:54:47,152 --> 00:54:51,145
我不知道你想证明什么 这老头的确看到那个孩子了

749
00:54:51,356 --> 00:54:53,381
我们来看看他说的话是不是真的

750
00:54:53,591 --> 00:54:58,028
他说他听到楼上传来脚步声 脚步声一路传到了门口

751
00:54:58,229 --> 00:55:01,357
他听到门打开的声音 还听到有人冲下楼

752
00:55:01,566 --> 00:55:05,900
他跑到大门口 非常肯定整个过程只有十五秒

753
00:55:06,071 --> 00:55:08,266
- 凶手拔腿就跑- -  - 他没有那么说

754
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,998
那老头真的是那么说的

755
00:55:10,175 --> 00:55:13,440
你应该去参加 吹毛求疵大会

756
00:55:13,611 --> 00:55:16,102
你为什么 还要装出自以为聪明的样子？

757
00:55:16,281 --> 00:55:18,306
当陪审员一天只能赚三块钱- - 

758
00:55:18,483 --> 00:55:20,849
现在你害我们被困在这里 你到底有什么好处？

759
00:55:21,019 --> 00:55:22,714
这就是案发现场

760
00:55:22,887 --> 00:55:26,516
老人的家就在楼下 隔局完全是一样的

761
00:55:26,691 --> 00:55:29,660
这是走道，客厅，浴室

762
00:55:29,828 --> 00:55:34,128
这是走廊，楼梯 当时老人在他的卧房里

763
00:55:34,299 --> 00:55:36,995
他打开了房门 一路冲到走廊的另一端...

764
00:55:37,168 --> 00:55:41,036
他及时打开大门 看到那孩子冲下楼梯

765
00:55:41,206 --> 00:55:43,436
他一再陈述着这样的证词

766
00:55:43,608 --> 00:55:46,008
离他听到有人倒在地上的声音 只差了十五秒

767
00:55:46,177 --> 00:55:49,112
- 没错 - 现在让我们来看看....

768
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:53,216
床铺离房门有十二尺 走廊有四十三尺长

769
00:55:53,384 --> 00:55:56,478
他得走上十二尺的距离 打开房门...

770
00:55:56,654 --> 00:56:00,283
走过四十三尺长的走廊 再打开大门，一共只花掉十五秒

771
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:02,426
- 你觉得他办得到吗？ - 当然可以

772
00:56:02,594 --> 00:56:05,495
他走起路来非常慢 还要法警来扶他

773
00:56:05,663 --> 00:56:07,392
你讲得好像这条路很远

774
00:56:07,565 --> 00:56:10,966
对一个中过风的老人来说 这段路的确很远

775
00:56:11,136 --> 00:56:13,502
- 你在做什么？ - 我打算亲自实验一下

776
00:56:13,671 --> 00:56:16,663
什么？ 他的律师为什么不那么做？

777
00:56:16,841 --> 00:56:19,969
- 或许他没有想到这一点 - 你是什么意思？

778
00:56:20,145 --> 00:56:21,737
- 这太明显了 - 而你就想到了这一点？

779
00:56:21,913 --> 00:56:25,144
他没有提出这一点 因为这对他很不利

780
00:56:25,316 --> 00:56:26,305
你觉得呢？

781
00:56:26,484 --> 00:56:30,284
他没有提出这一点 因为那证明了老人在说谎

782
00:56:30,455 --> 00:56:33,686
陪审团不喜欢这样的事 律师会尽量避免发生这种事

783
00:56:33,858 --> 00:56:36,383
- 他到底是个什么样的人？ - 我一直在问这个问题

784
00:56:36,561 --> 00:56:38,085
请把那张椅子拿过来给我

785
00:56:38,263 --> 00:56:41,232
我们用这些椅子来代表床 我要量出十二尺的距离

786
00:56:41,399 --> 00:56:45,665
- 这里就是房门口 - 你不能那样子重建现场

787
00:56:45,837 --> 00:56:50,240
- 我知道答案是什么 - 我要走到那道墙边再走回来

788
00:56:51,009 --> 00:56:54,308
你为什么要浪费大家的时间 把我们困在这里？

789
00:56:54,479 --> 00:56:59,280
根据你的说法这个部份 只花十五秒，我们要证明这一点

790
00:57:01,186 --> 00:57:03,347
喂，别吹了

791
00:57:03,521 --> 00:57:08,015
好吧，大天才

792
00:57:11,062 --> 00:57:13,121
你站在那里当大门

793
00:57:13,398 --> 00:57:15,628
还记得吗？当时大门上了门链

794
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,825
- 谁的手表有秒针？ - 我的手表有

795
00:57:18,002 --> 00:57:22,405
你准备好后就跺脚暗示我 然后开始帮我计时

796
00:57:22,574 --> 00:57:26,203
- 我们要来玩比手划脚的游戏吗？ - 我们还在等什么？

797
00:57:26,377 --> 00:57:29,369
我得等到秒针归零 才能开始计时

798
00:57:29,547 --> 00:57:31,344
少来了

799
00:57:37,488 --> 00:57:41,720
快一点 他走起路来的速度比你快两倍

800
00:57:41,893 --> 00:57:45,124
你要我走快一点吗？ 没问题

801
00:58:01,312 --> 00:58:04,509
- 开锁，打开门，停 - 好

802
00:58:04,682 --> 00:58:09,278
- 时间是多少？ - 四十一秒整

803
00:58:09,454 --> 00:58:11,319
- 四十一秒？ - 我想这才是真正的事实

804
00:58:11,489 --> 00:58:14,356
案发数小时前 老人听到了争吵声

805
00:58:14,525 --> 00:58:17,255
后来他躺在床上 听到有人倒在地上的声音...

806
00:58:17,428 --> 00:58:20,864
他听到了尖叫声 拼了老命地跑到大门口...

807
00:58:21,032 --> 00:58:23,432
他听到了脚步声 以为是那个孩子

808
00:58:23,601 --> 00:58:26,661
- 我想那是有可能的 - 那都是他的推测

809
00:58:28,139 --> 00:58:34,078
我看过各式各样的骗局 但你的示范真的是太惊人了

810
00:58:34,245 --> 00:58:39,046
你们带着一份热忱 去同情那些小混混跟非正义

811
00:58:39,217 --> 00:58:43,483
你们听到他编出来的故事 完全忘了什么才是真相

812
00:58:43,655 --> 00:58:46,453
你是骗不过我的 我受够了

813
00:58:46,624 --> 00:58:49,787
你们是怎么了？ 你们知道那孩子有罪！

814
00:58:49,961 --> 00:58:53,021
你们要让他逃过法律的制裁

815
00:58:53,197 --> 00:58:56,758
- 你是他的刽子手吗？ - 我是其中一个

816
00:58:58,236 --> 00:59:02,400
- 你想亲自按下开关 - 我的确想亲自帮那孩子行刑

817
00:59:02,573 --> 00:59:06,441
我为你感到遗憾 只有疯子才想亲自按下电椅开关

818
00:59:06,611 --> 00:59:10,513
你一走进这里 就一付想替天行道的模样

819
00:59:10,682 --> 00:59:14,914
你出自一片私心 想看到那孩子被判死刑

820
00:59:15,086 --> 00:59:17,179
你是个虐待狂

821
00:59:17,655 --> 00:59:21,091
放开我，我要杀了他 我要杀了他

822
00:59:21,259 --> 00:59:24,717
你该不会 真的想杀了我吧？

823
00:59:30,902 --> 00:59:33,462
怎么了？我听到吵闹声

824
00:59:33,638 --> 00:59:37,631
没事 我们只是起了一点小争执

825
00:59:37,809 --> 00:59:41,745
我们已经看过了配置图 请你把它拿走

826
00:59:41,913 --> 00:59:44,780
拿去吧，谢谢你

827
00:59:49,287 --> 00:59:51,755
你们在看什么？

828
01:00:11,809 --> 01:00:14,801
- 我想得有人站出来发言 - 对不起

829
01:00:14,979 --> 01:00:17,971
“对不起”？ 你干嘛变得那么有礼貌？

830
01:00:18,149 --> 01:00:23,086
就跟你没有礼貌的理由一样 我从小就是个有礼貌的人

831
01:00:24,222 --> 01:00:28,056
我们会来这里 不是来吵架的

832
01:00:28,226 --> 01:00:31,718
我们肩负着重责大任

833
01:00:31,896 --> 01:00:36,356
我一直觉得 这就是民主社会的优点

834
01:00:36,534 --> 01:00:39,503
我们- - 

835
01:00:40,171 --> 01:00:43,231
该怎么说呢？我们被通知

836
01:00:43,408 --> 01:00:47,071
我们收到信 被通知要来这里...

837
01:00:47,245 --> 01:00:53,377
决定一个跟我们 素昧平生的人到底有没有罪

838
01:00:54,018 --> 01:00:59,285
不论做出什么样的判决 我们都拿不到好处，也没有损失

839
01:00:59,457 --> 01:01:03,689
那就是我们的国家 能这么强大的原因

840
01:01:03,895 --> 01:01:07,797
我们不应该把这件事 跟私人的感觉扯上关系

841
01:01:08,132 --> 01:01:09,895
谢谢

842
01:01:11,235 --> 01:01:13,260
如果没有人想发言，我有个主意

843
01:01:13,438 --> 01:01:17,397
现在把事情摊在阳光下 看看我们能不能得到结论

844
01:01:17,575 --> 01:01:21,477
- “得到结论” - 没错

845
01:01:24,649 --> 01:01:27,051
外面的天色非常暗

846
01:01:27,051 --> 01:01:30,043
我猜应该是要下大雨了

847
01:01:31,122 --> 01:01:34,387
天啊，真的好热

848
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:39,128
对不起，你从来都不流汗吗？

849
01:01:39,297 --> 01:01:41,390
我不流汗的

850
01:01:41,699 --> 01:01:46,227
听着，我在想...

851
01:01:46,404 --> 01:01:49,430
或许我们该再投一次票

852
01:01:49,607 --> 01:01:54,670
太棒了，或许我们接下来 该跳个舞，吃点东西来庆祝一下

853
01:01:54,845 --> 01:01:57,780
- 团长先生？ - 我没有意见

854
01:01:57,949 --> 01:01:59,780
有人反对进行投票吗？

855
01:01:59,951 --> 01:02:03,079
- 来吧 - 什么？对不起

856
01:02:03,254 --> 01:02:06,690
我们应该做公开投票 表明自己的意愿

857
01:02:06,857 --> 01:02:10,384
- 来看看每个人的立场是什么 - 我觉得听起来挺公平的

858
01:02:10,561 --> 01:02:12,893
有人反对吗？

859
01:02:14,298 --> 01:02:18,200
好吧，我会照编号来叫大家，一号

860
01:02:18,369 --> 01:02:22,601
我是一号，我投“有罪”，二号？

861
01:02:22,974 --> 01:02:24,271
无罪

862
01:02:24,809 --> 01:02:26,106
三号？

863
01:02:26,677 --> 01:02:28,269
有罪

864
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:30,672
四号？

865
01:02:31,983 --> 01:02:33,280
有罪

866
01:02:33,451 --> 01:02:34,850
五号？

867
01:02:35,353 --> 01:02:37,321
无罪

868
01:02:37,488 --> 01:02:39,285
六号？

869
01:02:39,457 --> 01:02:40,754
无罪

870
01:02:41,659 --> 01:02:43,422
七号？

871
01:02:43,761 --> 01:02:45,228
有罪

872
01:02:45,396 --> 01:02:47,193
八号？

873
01:02:47,531 --> 01:02:49,499
无罪

874
01:02:50,134 --> 01:02:51,499
九号？

875
01:02:51,702 --> 01:02:53,192
无罪

876
01:02:53,371 --> 01:02:54,633
十号？

877
01:02:54,805 --> 01:02:56,363
有罪

878
01:02:57,375 --> 01:02:59,343
十一号？

879
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:01,410
无罪

880
01:03:01,579 --> 01:03:02,876
十二号？

881
01:03:03,914 --> 01:03:06,178
十二号？

882
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:07,715
有罪

883
01:03:13,824 --> 01:03:15,792
现在的票数是六比六

884
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:20,624
没错，我们现在 要打延长赛了，对吧？

885
01:03:21,032 --> 01:03:22,397
六比六

886
01:03:22,566 --> 01:03:25,967
你们之中有些人一定是疯了

887
01:03:26,137 --> 01:03:27,604
像他那样的孩子没救了

888
01:03:27,772 --> 01:03:31,173
我觉得他是什么样的孩子 跟这件事无关

889
01:03:31,342 --> 01:03:34,277
- 事实可以决定一切 - 少拿那一套来唬我

890
01:03:34,445 --> 01:03:37,380
我厌倦了事实 反正到最后你也会扭曲一切

891
01:03:37,548 --> 01:03:40,881
那就是这个先生所强调的重点

892
01:03:41,052 --> 01:03:44,579
你一直扯着嗓门 对我们大吼大叫的

893
01:03:45,089 --> 01:03:50,186
真希望我能年轻个几岁 那家伙害得我....

894
01:03:52,463 --> 01:03:55,023
- 真的好热喔 - 你要喝点水吗？

895
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:58,999
不用了，谢谢你

896
01:04:06,811 --> 01:04:08,574
快下雨了

897
01:04:08,746 --> 01:04:11,738
你怎么知道呢？ 大天才

898
01:04:12,183 --> 01:04:14,151
你为什么会改变心意？

899
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:16,809
这个案子看起来 真的有值得质疑的地方

900
01:04:16,987 --> 01:04:20,150
- 你根本就是墙头草 - 我不那么认为

901
01:04:20,324 --> 01:04:23,316
- 很多的细节并没有查清楚 - 祝你好运

902
01:04:23,494 --> 01:04:29,023
少来了，你跟其他人一样 你想的太多反而被弄迷糊了

903
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:33,227
- 你瞭解我的意思吗？ - 我不认为你有权利- - 

904
01:04:33,404 --> 01:04:35,497
大嘴巴

905
01:05:28,359 --> 01:05:31,556
看看这场大雨

906
01:05:32,263 --> 01:05:37,223
你知道吗？这让我想起 之前遇到的一场西北雨....

907
01:05:38,402 --> 01:05:41,769
那是十一月的事吗？ 我不知道，可能是吧

908
01:05:41,939 --> 01:05:45,966
那场雨下的真大 当时球赛进行到一半

909
01:05:46,277 --> 01:05:49,872
我们以六比七落后 那时由我们来进攻

910
01:05:50,047 --> 01:05:57,317
做出了一个漂亮的擒抱 开始切往右边，一路往前冲

911
01:05:58,556 --> 01:06:01,616
队上有个孩子姓史拉特利

912
01:06:01,959 --> 01:06:05,258
他就跟一头蛮牛一样

913
01:06:05,429 --> 01:06:08,023
我巴不得能找到 另一个跟他一模一样的球员

914
01:06:08,199 --> 01:06:12,727
我是安德鲁麦柯克高中 足球位的助理总教练

915
01:06:12,903 --> 01:06:14,734
那所学校在皇后区

916
01:06:14,905 --> 01:06:19,535
总之我们的攻势 非常地顺利

917
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:24,113
你知道的 对手的防守阵线开始崩溃

918
01:06:24,348 --> 01:06:27,909
突然间天空开始下起大雨 雨势就跟这场雨一样大

919
01:06:28,085 --> 01:06:31,919
那场雨来的很突然

920
01:06:32,089 --> 01:06:35,320
那真是要人命，你知道吗？

921
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:40,828
我发誓那时我差点要疯了 你真的是一点办法都没有

922
01:06:41,765 --> 01:06:43,027
没错

923
01:06:58,749 --> 01:07:02,116
这个电扇到底是怎么一回事？ 怎么会...

924
01:07:09,193 --> 01:07:10,922
嘿，看

925
01:07:12,162 --> 01:07:14,960
原来是要从电灯的开关 来启动它

926
01:07:15,132 --> 01:07:18,659
局势开始好转了，对吧

927
01:07:18,902 --> 01:07:20,460
没错

928
01:07:25,209 --> 01:07:28,178
天啊，凉快多了

929
01:07:34,051 --> 01:07:37,578
进了

930
01:07:41,292 --> 01:07:44,159
你们去过花园广场吗？

931
01:07:45,496 --> 01:07:48,363
那么做真的是太蠢了

932
01:07:48,666 --> 01:07:51,362
对不起，我....

933
01:07:51,735 --> 01:07:52,997
你知道吗？

934
01:07:54,838 --> 01:07:56,806
对不起

935
01:07:57,408 --> 01:08:02,107
你觉得如何呢？现在是平分 令人跌破眼镜吧

936
01:08:02,279 --> 01:08:03,837
没错

937
01:08:05,516 --> 01:08:08,974
那个叫什么来着的高个儿...

938
01:08:09,153 --> 01:08:13,146
想要引我上钩时 但那无法证明任何事

939
01:08:13,324 --> 01:08:18,557
他为什么要说我想替天行道 还骂我虐待狂？

940
01:08:18,729 --> 01:08:21,994
谁敢不顺他的心 就会被他狠狠地修理一顿

941
01:08:22,166 --> 01:08:24,361
他只是想引我上钩

942
01:08:24,535 --> 01:08:27,231
他做的太好了

943
01:08:29,306 --> 01:08:33,902
我得告诉你，我们无法做出结论 我准备宣布本案将成为悬判

944
01:08:34,078 --> 01:08:37,172
- 我们无法再继续谈下去 - 我赞成你的说法

945
01:08:37,348 --> 01:08:40,181
把那个孩子 交给下一批陪审员来处理

946
01:08:40,351 --> 01:08:43,377
我不认为法官会接受 悬判的判决

947
01:08:43,554 --> 01:08:46,580
- 我们走着瞧吧 - 我不打算那么做

948
01:08:46,757 --> 01:08:50,056
把本案交给下一批陪审员 那孩子是死路一条

949
01:08:50,227 --> 01:08:52,991
我们无法做出结论 没有人能改变那家伙的决定

950
01:08:53,163 --> 01:08:56,655
- 你还是觉得这个案子很合理？ - 没错

951
01:08:56,834 --> 01:09:01,396
对不起，或许你不瞭解 “合理怀疑”的意思

952
01:09:02,039 --> 01:09:05,031
你说我不瞭解是什么意思？

953
01:09:05,209 --> 01:09:08,576
天啊，你对这家伙有什么看法 他们全都是一个样子

954
01:09:08,746 --> 01:09:11,579
他们来到这里 他们椅子都还没有坐热...

955
01:09:11,749 --> 01:09:14,183
就急着告诉我们 该怎么做出判决

956
01:09:14,351 --> 01:09:16,080
这个家伙真的是太傲慢了

957
01:09:16,253 --> 01:09:20,713
好吧，请大家暂时 停止争执

958
01:09:20,891 --> 01:09:22,688
谁想发表有建设性的意见？

959
01:09:23,394 --> 01:09:26,886
如果大家不介意的话 我有一些话想说

960
01:09:27,064 --> 01:09:31,694
对检方来说有一件事非常重要 那个孩子说...

961
01:09:31,869 --> 01:09:34,394
案发时 他人在电影院里...

962
01:09:34,571 --> 01:09:38,473
他不记得那部电影 及片中演员的名字

963
01:09:38,776 --> 01:09:41,210
这位先生提到了重点

964
01:09:41,378 --> 01:09:44,370
没错，那是被告 提出的唯一不在场证明

965
01:09:44,548 --> 01:09:47,039
但他无法说明 所有的细节

966
01:09:47,351 --> 01:09:48,886
你觉得 被自己的父亲打了巴掌后...

967
01:09:48,886 --> 01:09:50,513
你觉得 被自己的父亲打了巴掌后...

968
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:54,020
你可以记得起 这些小事吗？

969
01:09:54,191 --> 01:09:57,251
我想应该可以 只要这些细节很特别

970
01:09:57,427 --> 01:10:00,590
那孩子什么都记不起来 因为他根本不在电影院里

971
01:10:01,131 --> 01:10:05,864
警方在那孩子家里的厨房 讯问他...

972
01:10:06,036 --> 01:10:08,937
当时他父亲的尸体还躺在地上

973
01:10:09,106 --> 01:10:12,041
在那种情况下 你还想起任何事吗？

974
01:10:12,209 --> 01:10:14,677
- 在那么大的压力下？ - 一点都没错

975
01:10:14,845 --> 01:10:18,042
他在法庭上想起所有细节 说出电影跟演员的名字

976
01:10:18,215 --> 01:10:21,616
对，他的律师花了一番力气 才让他说出来

977
01:10:21,785 --> 01:10:25,778
从案发到接受审判 他有好几个月的时间回想细节

978
01:10:25,956 --> 01:10:30,325
要查出某家电影院 当时在放映那部电影并不难

979
01:10:30,494 --> 01:10:34,157
我相信那个孩子 在案发后...

980
01:10:34,331 --> 01:10:38,597
记不起电影名字的证词 不论他当时是否承受极大的压力

981
01:10:39,002 --> 01:10:42,062
- 我想问你一个问题 - 请说

982
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:45,299
- 昨天晚上你在哪里？ - 我在家里

983
01:10:45,475 --> 01:10:47,966
- 前天晚上呢？ - 这是什么意思？

984
01:10:48,145 --> 01:10:49,407
没关系，我不在意

985
01:10:49,613 --> 01:10:51,945
我八点半下班 然后就回家了

986
01:10:52,115 --> 01:10:56,313
- 大前天晚上呢？ - 那是星期二晚上

987
01:10:56,486 --> 01:10:59,387
- 那天我去打桥牌了 - 星期一晚上呢？

988
01:10:59,556 --> 01:11:04,050
回想到1954年的新年除夕时 再来叫我

989
01:11:05,028 --> 01:11:07,155
星期一晚上吗？

990
01:11:08,165 --> 01:11:11,191
星期一晚上 我跟我太太去看电影

991
01:11:11,368 --> 01:11:14,303
- 你们看了哪部电影

992
01:11:14,504 --> 01:11:17,268
- 第二部是什么呢？ - 是....

993
01:11:19,042 --> 01:11:21,636
我待会再告诉你

994
01:11:21,812 --> 01:11:26,909
《TheRemarkableMrs》.... 什么来着....

995
01:11:28,652 --> 01:11:31,212
《TheRemarkableMrs.Bainbridge.》

996
01:11:31,388 --> 01:11:35,347
我看过那部电影，它叫做 《TheAmazingMrs.Bainbridge.》

997
01:11:35,525 --> 01:11:37,720
没错

998
01:11:37,894 --> 01:11:40,294
的主角是谁呢？

999
01:11:40,464 --> 01:11:46,835
芭芭拉隆格 我觉得她是个漂亮的黑美人

1000
01:11:47,771 --> 01:11:50,035
她应该是姓林德或隆格

1001
01:11:50,207 --> 01:11:53,370
- 还有谁呢？ - 我从来没有听过他们的名字

1002
01:11:53,543 --> 01:11:57,843
它是一部低成本的二线电影 请了名不见经传....

1003
01:11:58,015 --> 01:12:01,815
当时你并没有承受 极大的情绪压力吧

1004
01:12:03,954 --> 01:12:08,118
没有

1005
01:12:09,726 --> 01:12:13,924
- 我想重点大家都瞭解了 - 好大的重点喔

1006
01:12:14,398 --> 01:12:18,232
你爱怎么说随便你 那孩子还是有罪

1007
01:12:18,402 --> 01:12:20,734
你瞭解我的意思吗？

1008
01:12:20,904 --> 01:12:24,897
- 你还有喉糖吗？ - 已经吃完了

1009
01:12:26,376 --> 01:12:30,676
天啊，雨下的还真大 看来你的球赛应该会取消

1010
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:33,213
这只是一场阵雨

1011
01:12:33,383 --> 01:12:35,817
而且内野一定会盖上防水布

1012
01:12:35,986 --> 01:12:39,854
我能再看看那把刀子吗？

1013
01:12:41,425 --> 01:12:45,862
现在票数还是六比六平手 有人有任何建议吗？

1014
01:12:46,029 --> 01:12:50,295
- 已经过了六点，去吃晚餐吧 - 等到七点再说，再谈一小时吧

1015
01:12:50,467 --> 01:12:51,900
我没有意见

1016
01:12:52,936 --> 01:12:55,097
我有一件事想说

1017
01:12:55,272 --> 01:12:58,673
这件事一直让我觉得很困扰 既然我们被困在这里....

1018
01:12:58,842 --> 01:13:02,642
对于死者的致命伤 跟其成因我一直觉得不太对劲

1019
01:13:02,813 --> 01:13:06,214
- 伤口的角度向下 - 你们又来了

1020
01:13:06,383 --> 01:13:10,410
- 律师们已经讨论过这一点 - 我知道，但我就是觉得不对劲

1021
01:13:10,587 --> 01:13:14,614
那孩子五尺七寸高 他父亲是六尺二寸高

1022
01:13:14,791 --> 01:13:16,986
他们的身高相差七寸

1023
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:21,392
要往下刺伤一个比你高半尺的人 不是一件很简单的事

1024
01:13:21,565 --> 01:13:23,863
请把刀子递给我

1025
01:13:24,034 --> 01:13:27,902
我来示范给你们看 麻烦哪位过来一下

1026
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:37,072
大家仔细看着 我不会再示范第二次

1027
01:13:37,247 --> 01:13:40,045
我会往下蹲 让自己比他矮上七寸，好吗？

1028
01:13:40,217 --> 01:13:44,347
- 大概是这样，还要再低一点 - 好了，再蹲低一点

1029
01:13:55,599 --> 01:13:58,625
别担心....我不会来真的

1030
01:13:58,869 --> 01:14:02,771
- 是吗？ - 没有人会受伤的

1031
01:14:05,342 --> 01:14:10,143
我就是这样 刺伤比我高的人

1032
01:14:10,313 --> 01:14:12,804
你们看看这个角度是往下压的

1033
01:14:12,983 --> 01:14:17,613
他就是这样杀了他父亲 你们可以说我错了

1034
01:14:19,456 --> 01:14:22,721
- 角度往下压，一定不会错的 - 请等一下

1035
01:14:22,893 --> 01:14:25,020
麻烦你把刀子递给我

1036
01:14:25,695 --> 01:14:27,458
天啊，我恨透这些事了

1037
01:14:27,664 --> 01:14:29,291
- 你看过别人互砍的样子吗？ - 没有

1038
01:14:29,466 --> 01:14:30,956
- 你呢？ - 没有

1039
01:14:31,134 --> 01:14:33,932
有人看过别人互砍的样子吗？

1040
01:14:34,104 --> 01:14:35,093
我看过

1041
01:14:35,272 --> 01:14:39,174
当时我曲着身体 他们在对街的院子里械斗

1042
01:14:39,342 --> 01:14:41,936
在我住的社区里 拥有摺叠刀不是稀奇的事

1043
01:14:42,112 --> 01:14:44,876
我不想去想起这种事 一直都努力地想忘了它

1044
01:14:45,048 --> 01:14:49,678
- 你都是怎么使用摺叠刀的？ - 没有人会这样使用摺叠刀

1045
01:14:50,253 --> 01:14:53,689
这样子要亮出刀子 会浪费掉太多时间

1046
01:14:54,391 --> 01:14:57,485
大家都是这样向下拿着刀子

1047
01:14:59,362 --> 01:15:02,763
使用摺叠刀的人 都是这样拿刀子的

1048
01:15:02,933 --> 01:15:05,265
- 你确定？ - 我非常确定

1049
01:15:05,435 --> 01:15:09,872
- 那样子才能把刀子弹开 - 那孩子对使用刀子非常熟悉

1050
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:12,975
你觉得他有办法 那样杀死他父亲吗？

1051
01:15:13,143 --> 01:15:17,204
不可能，除非经过练习 不然他不可能是那样拿刀子的

1052
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:20,508
- 他一定是偷偷地攻击他的 - 你怎么知道？

1053
01:15:20,684 --> 01:15:24,518
- 你当时也在现场吗？ - 不，当时现场没有其他人

1054
01:15:24,688 --> 01:15:27,782
你凭什么告诉我们 这些凭空杜撰的事？

1055
01:15:27,958 --> 01:15:31,450
我不认为你可以 判定那孩子是怎么杀人的...

1056
01:15:31,628 --> 01:15:33,823
因为他知道如何使用刀子

1057
01:15:33,997 --> 01:15:36,158
你觉得呢？

1058
01:15:36,433 --> 01:15:38,560
- 我不知道 - 你是什么意思？

1059
01:15:38,735 --> 01:15:40,532
我不知道

1060
01:15:44,574 --> 01:15:46,508
你呢？

1061
01:15:46,676 --> 01:15:50,168
我不知道其他人是怎么想的 但我已经厌倦了这种情况

1062
01:15:50,347 --> 01:15:53,839
这样子下去是不会有结论的 我想我要做出突破

1063
01:15:54,017 --> 01:15:56,542
我要改变决定，投“无罪”一票

1064
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:59,985
- 你说什么？ - 你都听到了，我受够了

1065
01:16:00,156 --> 01:16:02,056
什么？那不是答案

1066
01:16:02,459 --> 01:16:06,361
听着，你只要搞定 你自己就好了，你知道吗？

1067
01:16:06,529 --> 01:16:10,363
他说的对，那不是答案

1068
01:16:10,734 --> 01:16:13,567
你到底是什么样的人？

1069
01:16:13,737 --> 01:16:16,900
你刚刚还投“有罪”一票 赞同其他人的意见...

1070
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:21,169
只因为你急着要去看球赛

1071
01:16:21,344 --> 01:16:26,179
现在你改变了心意 因为你厌倦了这些讨论

1072
01:16:26,349 --> 01:16:27,873
听我说，兄弟

1073
01:16:28,051 --> 01:16:32,784
谁告诉你你有权 这样子玩弄别人的生命？

1074
01:16:32,956 --> 01:16:35,288
- 你不在乎吗？ - 等一下

1075
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:39,394
- 你不能那样子跟我说话 - 我当然可以那样子跟你说话

1076
01:16:39,562 --> 01:16:42,725
如果你要投“无罪”一票 必须是因为你相信...

1077
01:16:42,899 --> 01:16:45,629
被告的确是无罪的 而不是因为你觉得厌烦

1078
01:16:45,802 --> 01:16:48,430
如果你觉得他有罪 你得坚持下去

1079
01:16:48,838 --> 01:16:51,636
难道你没有种 去做你认为是对的事吗？

1080
01:16:51,808 --> 01:16:54,003
- 听我说- -  - 你认为他有罪或无罪

1081
01:16:54,944 --> 01:16:58,380
- 我说过了他无罪 - 为什么？

1082
01:17:00,150 --> 01:17:01,708
听着，我不必- - 

1083
01:17:01,885 --> 01:17:04,911
你非说出来不可，为什么？

1084
01:17:05,088 --> 01:17:09,047
好吧，我不认为他有罪

1085
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,061
- 我要求再投一次票 - 好的，有人要求再投一次票

1086
01:17:21,237 --> 01:17:24,104
最快的方法是举手

1087
01:17:24,273 --> 01:17:28,004
好吧，认为被告“无罪”的人 请举手

1088
01:17:28,177 --> 01:17:34,138
一，二，三，四 五，六，七...

1089
01:17:36,085 --> 01:17:37,677
八

1090
01:17:42,925 --> 01:17:44,620
九

1091
01:17:46,596 --> 01:17:49,690
认为被告“有罪”的人 请举手

1092
01:17:49,866 --> 01:17:52,232
一，二，三

1093
01:17:52,402 --> 01:17:55,735
票数是九比三 无罪的一方占优势

1094
01:17:55,905 --> 01:17:57,896
我搞不清楚你们这些人

1095
01:17:58,074 --> 01:18:01,601
你们提出的那些细节 根本一点都不重要

1096
01:18:01,778 --> 01:18:03,678
你们跟我都看到了那个孩子

1097
01:18:03,846 --> 01:18:07,247
你们相信 他说他的刀子不见了...

1098
01:18:07,417 --> 01:18:09,385
案发时他在看电影的说词

1099
01:18:09,552 --> 01:18:12,419
这些人在说谎 那是他们天生的劣根性

1100
01:18:12,588 --> 01:18:16,456
不必我来提醒你们 他们根本不知道什么是事实

1101
01:18:16,626 --> 01:18:22,087
听我说 那些人杀人是不必有理由的

1102
01:18:22,265 --> 01:18:26,292
他们喝醉了 他们全都烂醉如泥

1103
01:18:26,469 --> 01:18:29,802
突然间有人倒在水沟里 没有人怪他们

1104
01:18:29,972 --> 01:18:34,033
那就是他们天生的劣根性 你们懂吗？他们有暴力倾向

1105
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:35,472
你要去哪里？

1106
01:18:35,645 --> 01:18:39,479
他们的想法跟我们一样 人命是不值钱的

1107
01:18:39,649 --> 01:18:45,952
他们老是打成一团 就算有人死了，他们也不在乎

1108
01:18:46,122 --> 01:18:50,183
他们之间还是有好人 我是第一个会那么说的人

1109
01:18:50,359 --> 01:18:53,920
我认识一两个还不错的混混 但那是例外

1110
01:18:54,097 --> 01:18:57,589
大部份的人都很无情 他们什么事都做得出来

1111
01:18:57,767 --> 01:19:00,395
这是怎么一回事？

1112
01:19:00,903 --> 01:19:05,397
我试着告诉你们 你们犯了大错，那孩子是骗子

1113
01:19:05,575 --> 01:19:08,601
我知道，我太瞭解那些人了

1114
01:19:09,312 --> 01:19:14,716
听我说，他们都是大坏蛋 他们之中根本没有好人

1115
01:19:15,885 --> 01:19:18,319
这到底是怎么一回事？

1116
01:19:18,488 --> 01:19:21,855
我说出我的想法，你们- - 

1117
01:19:22,024 --> 01:19:24,151
听我说

1118
01:19:27,196 --> 01:19:31,963
被告是个小混混 难道你们不瞭解他们那种人吗？

1119
01:19:32,702 --> 01:19:36,138
他们是危险人物

1120
01:19:36,305 --> 01:19:38,273
这些人很危险

1121
01:19:38,441 --> 01:19:41,433
他们真疯狂

1122
01:19:41,611 --> 01:19:43,340
听我说

1123
01:19:43,513 --> 01:19:45,845
- 听着 - 我在听

1124
01:19:46,015 --> 01:19:50,247
请你坐下 把你的嘴巴闭上

1125
01:19:52,822 --> 01:19:56,815
有时候....我告诉你....

1126
01:20:32,061 --> 01:20:37,328
面对这种事 要排除个人的偏见真的很难

1127
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:42,369
不论去到哪里 偏见总是遮蔽了真相

1128
01:20:43,172 --> 01:20:45,572
我真的不知道真相是什么

1129
01:20:45,741 --> 01:20:49,677
我想应该没有任何人 知道真相是什么

1130
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:53,679
我们九个人现在觉得 被告是无辜的...

1131
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:58,752
但我们是在赌一个可能性 或许我们错了

1132
01:20:58,921 --> 01:21:02,652
我们或许会放走一个杀人犯 我不知道

1133
01:21:02,825 --> 01:21:07,285
没有人知道 但我们有合理的怀疑...

1134
01:21:07,463 --> 01:21:11,229
那是我们的司法制度中 非常珍贵的一部份

1135
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:16,895
除非十分确定 陪审团无法判决被告有罪

1136
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:22,337
我们九个人不瞭解 你们三个为什么还那么地确定

1137
01:21:23,279 --> 01:21:26,442
- 或是你们可以好好解释一下 - 我会的

1138
01:21:26,716 --> 01:21:30,277
有说地方你的确很有说服力 但我相信那孩子有罪...

1139
01:21:30,453 --> 01:21:32,011
原因有二

1140
01:21:32,188 --> 01:21:37,683
一是目赌凶案经过的那位女士 在法庭上做出的证词

1141
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:40,556
那是最重要的证词

1142
01:21:40,730 --> 01:21:45,167
二是她描述她看到的凶案经过 她说她看到那个孩子...

1143
01:21:45,334 --> 01:21:49,532
双手高举过头 拿刀往他父亲的胸口刺下

1144
01:21:49,705 --> 01:21:53,664
- 她看到他杀了人 - 一点都没错

1145
01:21:54,210 --> 01:21:56,303
我们来谈谈这位女士

1146
01:21:56,479 --> 01:21:59,607
她说案发当晚 她大约在十一点上床睡觉

1147
01:21:59,782 --> 01:22:03,240
她的床就在窗户旁边 只要她一往外看...

1148
01:22:03,419 --> 01:22:07,378
她可以看到那孩子 在对街的房间

1149
01:22:07,556 --> 01:22:10,047
那晚她翻来覆去 大约一个小时

1150
01:22:10,226 --> 01:22:14,390
大约在十二点十分 她转身面向窗户...

1151
01:22:14,563 --> 01:22:16,053
她往外一看...

1152
01:22:16,232 --> 01:22:19,633
透过电车车窗 看到杀人的经过

1153
01:22:19,802 --> 01:22:22,362
她说在凶案发生后 四周是一片漆黑...

1154
01:22:22,538 --> 01:22:28,238
但她非常清楚地看到 那孩子拿刀刺向他父亲

1155
01:22:28,411 --> 01:22:32,780
在我的看法里 这项证词坚不可破

1156
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:37,180
- 就是那么一回事 - 你有什么看法？

1157
01:22:40,890 --> 01:22:43,154
你觉得呢？

1158
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,755
我不知道

1159
01:22:46,929 --> 01:22:50,729
很多证词都有待调查 这是一个很复杂的案子

1160
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:54,700
老实说我不明白 你们为什么会认为他无罪？

1161
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:57,270
要安排这样的证词 并不容易

1162
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:00,432
抛开其他的证据不谈 那位女士真的看到他了

1163
01:23:00,609 --> 01:23:02,907
你还要什么样的证据呢？

1164
01:23:03,079 --> 01:23:04,808
- 或许- -  - 我们来投票吧

1165
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:09,007
好吧，有人要求再度投票 有人反对吗？

1166
01:23:09,185 --> 01:23:12,086
好吧，我改变了心意 他有罪

1167
01:23:12,488 --> 01:23:14,683
其他人呢？现在票数是八比四

1168
01:23:14,857 --> 01:23:18,258
为什么你那么得意呢？ 那只是一票

1169
01:23:18,427 --> 01:23:21,885
我说过此案会形成悬判 这样子告诉法官吧

1170
01:23:22,064 --> 01:23:24,862
你们觉得如何呢？ 我想听听大家的意见

1171
01:23:25,034 --> 01:23:28,401
这都是你惹出来的 你觉得如何呢？

1172
01:23:29,538 --> 01:23:33,167
- 我们再来讨论一次 - 我们已经讨论过了

1173
01:23:33,342 --> 01:23:38,177
那孩子像球一样 被我们踢来踢去

1174
01:23:38,347 --> 01:23:43,785
我们不该再折磨他了 你只是想为自己争一口气

1175
01:23:44,253 --> 01:23:45,515
好吧

1176
01:23:45,688 --> 01:23:48,623
或许我们该应该 订出一个最后期限

1177
01:23:48,791 --> 01:23:51,555
时间一到我们就得做出结论

1178
01:23:51,727 --> 01:23:57,529
现在是六点十五分 之前有人提过七点要吃晚餐

1179
01:23:57,700 --> 01:24:03,138
我们就讨论到七点 不论这个案子会不会形成悬判

1180
01:24:03,472 --> 01:24:08,273
- 你不舒服吗？ - 我很好，谢谢你

1181
01:24:08,444 --> 01:24:11,277
我觉得讨论到七点 是个合理的- - 

1182
01:24:11,447 --> 01:24:16,282
我会那么说是因为 你一直在按摩你的鼻子- - 

1183
01:24:16,452 --> 01:24:21,788
对不起，你的动作 让我想起了一件事

1184
01:24:21,957 --> 01:24:26,894
- 我正在说服大家订出规则来 - 我觉得这件事非常重要

1185
01:24:27,363 --> 01:24:28,887
谢谢你

1186
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:31,589
我相信 你会原谅我这么说...

1187
01:24:31,767 --> 01:24:34,964
我一直在想 你为什么要那样按摩你的鼻子

1188
01:24:35,137 --> 01:24:36,399
少来了

1189
01:24:36,572 --> 01:24:40,599
我是在跟 坐在你隔壁的先生说话

1190
01:24:40,776 --> 01:24:43,802
你为什么要那样按摩你的鼻子？

1191
01:24:44,346 --> 01:24:48,339
我会这么做 是因为我觉得鼻子很痛

1192
01:24:48,517 --> 01:24:52,146
对不起 那是因为你戴眼镜的关系吗？

1193
01:24:52,321 --> 01:24:54,857
没错 我们可以谈正事了吗？

1194
01:24:54,857 --> 01:24:55,585
没错 我们可以谈正事了吗？

1195
01:24:55,757 --> 01:25:00,285
你的眼镜在鼻梁侧面 压出那些很深的印子

1196
01:25:00,462 --> 01:25:04,023
我之前没有注意到 那应该会很痛

1197
01:25:04,199 --> 01:25:06,190
你说的对

1198
01:25:06,368 --> 01:25:12,204
我不瞭解那种感觉 我的视力很好，没有戴过眼镜

1199
01:25:12,374 --> 01:25:15,935
请你别谈这些 眼科医生才会关心的事，好吗？

1200
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:19,603
出庭作证 说她看到凶案经过的那位女士...

1201
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:24,081
鼻梁侧面 也有相同的印子

1202
01:25:24,286 --> 01:25:27,949
- 天啊，他说的对 - 请安静

1203
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:32,059
再给我一点时间 让我把话说完

1204
01:25:32,227 --> 01:25:35,025
我不知道其他人是否注意到

1205
01:25:35,197 --> 01:25:41,363
那时我并不在意 但我的脑海中一直浮现她的脸庞

1206
01:25:42,170 --> 01:25:46,436
她脸上也有这样的印子 她在法庭上也一直在按摩鼻子

1207
01:25:47,009 --> 01:25:49,273
他说的对，她的确常常那么做

1208
01:25:50,445 --> 01:25:55,075
这位女士大约是四十五岁

1209
01:25:55,250 --> 01:26:01,314
她很努力让自己 看起来只有三十五岁的样子

1210
01:26:01,523 --> 01:26:04,822
她化了浓妆，染了头发...

1211
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:08,724
穿上年轻女孩 才会穿的新衣服

1212
01:26:08,897 --> 01:26:15,132
她没有戴眼镜，女人常那么做 你们应该能瞭解她们的心态

1213
01:26:15,304 --> 01:26:18,273
你是什么意思？ 你怎么知道她有戴眼镜？

1214
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:21,637
- 就因为她会按摩鼻子吗？ - 她脸上也有那种印子

1215
01:26:22,044 --> 01:26:25,480
- 你觉得那代表什么意思？ - 我厌倦了你总是大吼大叫- - 

1216
01:26:25,647 --> 01:26:26,978
好了，别激动

1217
01:26:27,149 --> 01:26:31,552
听着，他说的对，我也看到了 我是最靠近她的人

1218
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:34,780
她鼻子上也有那些印子 这是叫什么来着的？

1219
01:26:34,957 --> 01:26:39,121
你想要证明什么？ 她染了头发，鼻子上有印子

1220
01:26:39,294 --> 01:26:40,625
那代表什么意思？

1221
01:26:40,796 --> 01:26:46,530
这些印子可能是除了眼镜以外 的其他东西造成的吗？

1222
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:50,900
不可能

1223
01:26:51,073 --> 01:26:54,372
我没看到她鼻子上有印子

1224
01:26:54,643 --> 01:26:58,875
我看到了，奇怪的是 我之前没有想到这一点

1225
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:01,538
律师呢？ 他为什么没有提出质疑？

1226
01:27:01,717 --> 01:27:06,313
这个房间里有十二个人 有十一个人也没有想到这一点

1227
01:27:06,488 --> 01:27:08,115
检察官呢？

1228
01:27:08,290 --> 01:27:11,521
你觉得是他要她 在出庭时拿下眼镜吗？

1229
01:27:11,693 --> 01:27:16,096
有些女人不喜欢戴眼镜 因为戴上眼镜她们会变得很丑

1230
01:27:16,264 --> 01:27:19,199
好吧，她的鼻子上有印子

1231
01:27:19,368 --> 01:27:22,963
我承认这一点 那是眼镜造成的，对吧？

1232
01:27:23,138 --> 01:27:27,370
她不想戴上眼镜 那样子大家会觉得她很漂亮

1233
01:27:27,542 --> 01:27:31,979
但她看到那孩子杀死他父亲时 她是一个人待在房里

1234
01:27:32,147 --> 01:27:34,012
就是那样

1235
01:27:34,349 --> 01:27:36,442
你会戴着眼镜睡觉吗？

1236
01:27:36,618 --> 01:27:41,783
我不会那么做 没有人会戴着眼镜睡觉

1237
01:27:41,957 --> 01:27:46,485
所以我们可能合理地推论 她躺在床上时并没有戴眼镜

1238
01:27:46,661 --> 01:27:48,959
- 你怎么知道？ - 那是我的推论

1239
01:27:49,131 --> 01:27:53,659
我推论她往窗外看去时 并没有戴眼镜

1240
01:27:53,835 --> 01:27:56,998
她作证说 案发时她刚好往窗外看去

1241
01:27:57,172 --> 01:27:59,663
她根本没有时间 把眼镜戴上

1242
01:27:59,841 --> 01:28:01,536
- 等一下- -  - 还有另一个推论

1243
01:28:01,710 --> 01:28:05,669
她真的认为她看到了那个孩子 但我觉得她只看到模糊的影子

1244
01:28:05,847 --> 01:28:09,544
你怎么知道她看到了什么？ 他怎么会知道那么多事？

1245
01:28:09,718 --> 01:28:14,018
你怎么知道她戴的是哪一种眼镜？ 或许她得的是远视？

1246
01:28:14,189 --> 01:28:18,785
- 你怎么会知道？ - 那个女人的视力现在成了争议

1247
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:24,489
她得在昏暗的夜色中不戴眼镜 辨识出六十尺外的人

1248
01:28:24,666 --> 01:28:27,931
只靠这样的证据 你不能让一个人坐上电椅

1249
01:28:28,103 --> 01:28:29,297
少来这一套

1250
01:28:29,471 --> 01:28:32,269
- 你觉得她看错了吗？ - 不

1251
01:28:32,607 --> 01:28:35,508
- 那是不可能的吗？ - 那是不可能的

1252
01:28:38,647 --> 01:28:41,138
这可能吗？

1253
01:28:41,683 --> 01:28:43,742
他是无罪的

1254
01:28:47,522 --> 01:28:49,854
你觉得他有罪吗？

1255
01:28:50,225 --> 01:28:52,887
我觉得他有罪

1256
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:56,930
你呢？

1257
01:28:59,534 --> 01:29:00,865
他无罪

1258
01:29:01,036 --> 01:29:03,971
我被说服了，他无罪

1259
01:29:04,139 --> 01:29:07,836
- 你是怎么了？ - 我现在有了合理的怀疑

1260
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:09,567
现在是十一比一

1261
01:29:09,778 --> 01:29:14,738
其他的证据又是怎么一回事？ 那把凶刀跟其他的证据呢？

1262
01:29:14,916 --> 01:29:18,647
你说过我们可以抛开 其他的证据

1263
01:29:23,625 --> 01:29:26,355
我们现在该怎么办？

1264
01:29:28,930 --> 01:29:30,329
你只剩下一个人

1265
01:29:30,999 --> 01:29:35,163
我不在乎自己是不是孤军奋战 这是我的权利

1266
01:29:37,606 --> 01:29:39,574
这是你的权利

1267
01:29:48,783 --> 01:29:51,752
你们打算怎么办？ 我认为他有罪

1268
01:29:52,888 --> 01:29:57,018
- 我们要听听你的说法 - 我该说的都说了

1269
01:29:57,459 --> 01:30:01,555
我们不相信你的说法 我们想再听一次

1270
01:30:02,197 --> 01:30:05,132
我们有的是时间

1271
01:30:09,938 --> 01:30:11,269
所有的证据

1272
01:30:11,439 --> 01:30:16,376
在法庭上做出的所有证词 都证明他有罪

1273
01:30:16,545 --> 01:30:19,571
难道你们认为我是白痴吗？

1274
01:30:20,549 --> 01:30:23,245
你们为什么不相信...

1275
01:30:23,451 --> 01:30:26,909
住在楼下的老人听到了声音？

1276
01:30:27,589 --> 01:30:31,525
你们推翻了凶刀的理论 就因为我们找到了类似的刀子？

1277
01:30:31,693 --> 01:30:34,992
那个老人看到他 从楼上冲了下来

1278
01:30:35,163 --> 01:30:38,326
他到底花了几秒跑到门口 那有什么差别？

1279
01:30:38,867 --> 01:30:41,700
所有的证据

1280
01:30:42,337 --> 01:30:45,568
刀子从他口袋的破洞 掉了出去

1281
01:30:45,740 --> 01:30:49,005
你不能证明 他没有夺门而出

1282
01:30:49,177 --> 01:30:54,012
你可以量时间，蹒跚地走来走去 但你无法证明那一点

1283
01:30:56,418 --> 01:30:59,683
关于电车 跟电影院又是怎么一回事呢？

1284
01:30:59,854 --> 01:31:02,823
我非常确定 那都是他编出来的谎言

1285
01:31:02,991 --> 01:31:07,189
我跟你赌五千块 我可以记得我看过的电影

1286
01:31:07,362 --> 01:31:13,323
我告诉你们 所有的事实都遭到了扭曲

1287
01:31:13,501 --> 01:31:15,526
关于眼镜的理论

1288
01:31:15,704 --> 01:31:21,199
你怎么知道当时她没有戴眼镜？ 这位女士在法庭上作证

1289
01:31:21,376 --> 01:31:24,004
还有那孩子的喊叫声呢？

1290
01:31:25,347 --> 01:31:29,113
我告诉你们 我知道什么才是事实

1291
01:31:29,651 --> 01:31:31,050
好了

1292
01:31:33,989 --> 01:31:36,958
够了，这就是事实

1293
01:31:43,698 --> 01:31:45,029
你们觉得呢？

1294
01:31:47,569 --> 01:31:49,537
快说啊

1295
01:31:54,809 --> 01:31:58,802
你们是一群狠心的混蛋

1296
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:04,145
你们无法威胁我 我要坚持我的想法

1297
01:32:07,055 --> 01:32:11,651
该死的孩子，你毁了自己的一生

1298
01:32:22,337 --> 01:32:24,066
不....

1299
01:32:28,176 --> 01:32:30,144
他无罪

1300
01:32:33,381 --> 01:32:35,178
他无罪

1301
01:32:50,699 --> 01:32:52,633
我们准备好了

1302
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:47,245
嘿

1303
01:34:52,053 --> 01:34:54,954
- 你叫什么名字？ - 我是戴维斯

1304
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:57,351
我叫迈卡迪

1305
01:34:59,727 --> 01:35:01,263
- 再见了 - 再见

1306
01:35:01,263 --> 01:35:02,821
- 再见了 - 再见

5
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:18,661
Thank you very much, sir.

6
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:20,913
You did a wonderful job. Wonderful.

7
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:23,374
Shh. Shh.

8
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:24,876
We did it, Pete. We did it.

9
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:28,671
- For a moment, we had our doubts.
- Shh.

10
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:32,175
To continue, you've listened
to a long and complex case...

11
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,051
murder in the first degree.

12
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:39,098
A premeditated murder is the most serious
charge tried in our criminal courts.

13
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:40,933
You've listened to the testimony.

14
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:43,936
You've had the law read to you
and interpreted as it applies in this case.

15
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:48,024
It's now your duty to sit down and try
and separate the facts from the fancy.

16
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:52,487
One man is dead.
Another man's life is at stake.

17
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,283
If there's a reasonable doubt in your minds
as to the guilt of the accused...

18
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,285
a reasonable doubt...

19
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,163
then you must bring me
a verdict of not guilty.

20
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,123
Now if, however,
there's no reasonable doubt...

21
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:08,085
then you must in good conscience
find the accused guilty.

22
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:13,341
However you decide,
your verdict must be unanimous.

23
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:16,803
In the event
that you find the accused guilty...

24
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:20,223
the bench will not entertain
a recommendation for mercy.

25
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:23,518
The death sentence
is mandatory in this case.

26
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:27,313
You're faced with a grave responsibility.
Thank you, gentlemen.

27
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,359
The alternate jurors are excused.

28
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,367
The jury will now retire.

29
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:39,362
Try this one. See if I can get it...

30
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,448
It's a muggy day.

31
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,079
Hey. Oh, oh.

32
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,218
- Piece of gum?
- No, thanks.

33
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,387
This thing is...

34
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,097
- Huh?
- ...move it.

35
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,892
- Come on, I'll give you a hand.
- Give me a hand with that.

36
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,310
That's it.

37
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,567
- You know something?
- Yeah?

38
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,403
I called the weather bureau this morning.

39
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,405
This is gonna be
the hottest day of the year.

40
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,073
Could be.

41
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,075
Boy, you'd think they'd at least
air-condition these places.

42
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,495
- What is your name, sir?
- Oh, it's, uh - That one, yeah.

43
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,997
Thank you very much.

44
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,833
Okay, gentlemen, everybody's here.

45
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,752
Now, if there's anything you want,
I'll be right outside the door.

46
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,088
- Just knock.
- Okay, thanks. We will.

47
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,810
Good morning.

48
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,353
I never knew they locked the door.

49
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,605
Sure they lock the door.
What'd you think?

50
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,109
I don't know.
It just never occurred to me.

51
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:03,529
What's that for?

52
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,489
Oh, I thought we might want
to vote by ballot.

53
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:08,242
Great idea. Maybe we can
get him elected senator.

54
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,246
Just in case, you know.

55
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:17,877
- Ηow'd you like it?
- Oh, I don't know.

56
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,628
It was pretty interesting.

57
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,672
Yeah? I almost fell asleep.

58
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:24,341
I mean, I've never been
on a jury before.

59
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:27,136
No? I've sat on many juries.

60
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:31,223
What gets me is the way
those lawyers talk and talk and talk...

61
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,476
even when it's an open-and-shut case
like this one.

62
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,269
Did you ever hear
so much talk about nothin'?

63
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,229
Well, I guess they're entitled.

64
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,774
Yeah. They're entitled.
It's the system, but...

65
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:45,071
If you ask me, I'd slap those tough kids
down before they start any trouble.

66
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:47,239
It would save us a lot of time and money.

67
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,866
- Hey, let's get started, huh?
- That's a good idea.

68
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,577
- Yeah, let's get goin', huh?
- We probably all got things to do here.

69
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,705
I figured we'd start out with a five-minute break.
There's one gentleman in the bathroom.

70
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,748
- Mr. Foreman.
- Huh?

71
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,626
- Are, uh - Are we gonna sit in order?
- Gee, I don't know.

72
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,461
I, uh - Well, I guess so.

73
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:06,926
Uh, you're in my seat.

74
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,011
- Oh. Excuse me.
- That's all right.

75
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,307
Hey, that's not a bad view, huh?

76
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,396
What did you think of the case?

77
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,524
I mean, it had a lot of interest for me.

78
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,735
No real... dead spots.
You know what I mean?

79
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,072
I tell you, we were lucky
to get a murder case.

80
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,116
I figured us for an assault or burglary.

81
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,451
Boy, they can be the dullest.

82
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,329
Hey.

83
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,997
That the Woolworth Building?

84
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,999
That's right.

85
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,668
Isn't that funny?

86
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,129
You know, I've lived here all my life.
I've never been inside that.

87
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,297
If you had to sort out all that junk...

88
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,466
Like that thing with the movies.

89
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:50,553
- Yeah. You can say that again.
- And what about that business with the knife?

90
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,514
I mean, asking grown-up people
to believe that kind of jazz, huh?

91
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,058
Well, I expected that.
You know what we're dealing with.

92
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,602
Yeah, I guess so.

93
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,396
Well, your horn works.
Now try your lights.

94
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,524
- What do you got, a cold?
- And how.

95
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,818
These hot-weather colds can kill you.

96
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,320
I can hardly touch my nose.
You know what I mean?

97
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:11,949
I sure do. I just got over one.

98
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,785
Aw, come on. Mr.
Foreman, let's go here, huh?

99
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,495
Well, that guy's still in the bathroom.

100
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,415
Hey, what's new? I didn't get a chance
to see a paper this morning.

101
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,583
Hmm?

102
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,085
I was only wondering
how the market closed.

103
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,880
You got a seat on the Exchange?

104
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,715
I'm a broker.

105
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:32,178
I run a messenger service -
the Beck and Call Company.

106
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,388
The name is my wife's idea.

107
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:38,100
Got 37 men working.
Started with nothing.

108
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:41,353
Okay, men, let's take our seats, huh?

109
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,358
Yeah, we can all get outta here
pretty quick, huh?

110
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:49,653
I don't know about the rest of you, but I happen
to have tickets to that ball game tonight.

111
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,572
Yanks and Cleveland.

112
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,449
Yeah, we got this kid,
Modjelewski, in there.

113
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,201
Ooh, he's a real bull, this kid.

114
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,411
You know - Phoom!

115
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,747
A real jug handle. You know?

116
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,082
Phoom!

117
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,501
You're a real baseball fan, aren't you?
Huh? Yeah.

118
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,045
Where do we sit here?

119
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:09,215
Well, I thought we'd sit in order,
you know, by jury numbers.

120
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,717
One, two, three, four, five -
so on, around the table.

121
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,052
If that's okay with you gentlemen.

122
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,220
- Sure.
- What's the difference?

123
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:17,348
- I think it's reasonable to sit in order.
- Let it be.

124
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,683
- Number 12. Do I sit down here?
- Yeah. That's 12. We go around...

125
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:23,020
- We start with you. One, right?
- One, yeah. Two, three, four, five, six.

126
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,439
What was your impression
of the prosecuting attorney?

127
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,233
Okay. Two. You're two.

128
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,484
I beg pardon?

129
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:32,738
I thought he was really sharp, the way
he handled all those points one by one.

130
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,950
Logical sequence.
I was very impressed.

131
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:39,036
I think he - he did an expert job.

132
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,122
A lot of drive too, you know?
Real drive.

133
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,291
- Okay, fellas, can we hold it down a minute?
- Sure.

134
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:45,960
Uh, fellas.

135
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:49,505
Say, we'd like to get started.
Gentleman at the window.

136
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,342
- We'd like to get started.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

137
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:57,096
Pretty tough to figure, isn't it?
Kid kills his father - bing, just like that.

138
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,765
Aw, listen, you analyze the figures,
you'll see it happens all the time.

139
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,767
They let those kids
run wild up there.

140
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,561
Well, maybe it serves 'em right.
You know what I mean?

141
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,230
Is - Is everyone here?

142
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,148
The old man is inside.

143
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,859
Oh. Would you, uh,
knock on the door for him?

144
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,903
You a Yankee fan?

145
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:14,530
No. Baltimore.

146
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,949
- Baltimore?
- Yeah.

147
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,786
That's like being hit in the head
with a crowbar once a day.

148
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:23,789
Who have they got?

149
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,292
No, I mean, who have they got
besides good groundskeepers?

150
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,918
Say, uh, we'd like to get started.

151
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:31,046
Oh, forgive me, gentlemen.
I - I didn't mean to keep you waiting.

152
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,632
Baltimore?

153
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:36,510
Okay, gentlemen,
if I can have your attention.

154
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,555
You fellas can handle this thing
any way that you want to.

155
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,141
I'm, um - You know,
I'm not gonna make any rules.

156
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:45,519
Uh, we can, well, discuss it first
and, uh, then vote on it.

157
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,272
That's, of course, uh -
That's, uh, one way.

158
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:51,317
And, uh, well, we can
vote on it right now, and...

159
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,902
I think it's customary
to take a preliminary vote.

160
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,573
Yeah, let's - Let's vote. Who knows?
Maybe we all can get outta here, huh?

161
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,366
Uh-huh.

162
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:02,536
Okay, then I think that, uh...

163
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,497
Of course you know that we have
a first-degree murder charge here...

164
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,666
and if we vote the accused guilty...

165
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:11,003
uh, we've got to send him
to the chair.

166
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,840
- Um, that's mandatory.
- I think we know that.

167
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,675
- Let's see who's where.
- We might as well.

168
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,554
- Okay. Uh, anyone doesn't want to vote?
- All right with me.

169
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:26,352
Okay. Then, uh, just remember that this
has to be 12 to nothing either way.

170
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,895
Um, that's the law.

171
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:30,022
Okay, are we ready?

172
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:33,108
Now, all those voting guilty,
please raise your hands.

173
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:40,616
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

174
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,536
eight, nine, 10, 11.

175
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:47,539
Okay. That's 11 guilty.

176
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,124
Those voting not guilty.

177
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,378
One. Right.

178
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,755
That's 11 guilty. One not guilty.

179
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,257
Well, now we know where we are.

180
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:01,512
Boy, oh, boy. There's always one.

181
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,348
So, what do we do now?

182
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,266
Well, I guess we talk.

183
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,684
Boy, oh, boy.

184
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,603
You really think he's innocent?

185
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,608
I don't know.

186
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,569
I mean, you sat in court with the rest of us.
You heard what we did.

187
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,780
The kid's a dangerous killer.
You could see it.

188
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,490
He's 18 years old.

189
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,659
Well, that's old enough. Ηe...

190
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,412
He stabbed his own father
four inches into the chest.

191
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,747
They proved it
a dozen different ways in court.

192
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:31,375
Would you like me to list them for you?

193
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,751
No.

194
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,920
Then what do you want?

195
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,923
- I just want to talk.
- What's there to talk about?

196
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,341
Eleven men in here think he's guilty.

197
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,677
No one had to think about it twice
except you.

198
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,972
I want to ask you something.
Do you believe his story?

199
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,766
I don't know whether I believe it or not.
Maybe I don't.

200
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,435
So how come you vote not guilty?

201
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,437
Well, there were 11 votes for guilty.

202
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,273
It's not easy to raise my hand
and send a boy off to die...

203
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,442
without talking about it first.

204
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,944
- Well, now, who says it's easy?
- No one.

205
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,406
What, just because I voted fast?

206
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,908
I honestly think the guy's guilty.

207
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,786
You couldn't change my mind
if you talked for a hundred years.

208
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,872
I'm not trying to change your mind.
It's just that...

209
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,708
We're talking about somebody's life here.

210
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,877
We can't decide it in five minutes.
Supposing we're wrong.

211
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,378
"Supposing we're wrong."

212
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,464
Supposing this whole building
should fall down on my head.

213
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,549
- You can suppose anything.
- That's right.

214
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,135
Look, what's the difference
how long it takes?

215
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,804
Suppose we do it in five minutes.
So what?

216
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,015
Let's take an hour.

217
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,017
The ball game doesn't start till 8:00.

218
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:33,896
Hmm?

219
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,900
Who's got something to say?

220
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,401
I'm willing to sit for an hour.

221
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:42,196
Great. I heard
a pretty good story last night.

222
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,364
That's not why we're sitting here.

223
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,619
All right, then you tell me.
What are we sitting here for?

224
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,705
I don't know. Maybe no reason.

225
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:56,168
Look, this kid's been kicked around
all of his life...

226
00:13:56,252 --> 00:14:00,172
you know, born in a slum,
mother dead since he was nine.

227
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,466
He lived for a year and a half
in an orphanage when his...

228
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,469
his father was serving a jail term
for forgery.

229
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,888
It's not a very happy beginning.

230
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,098
He's a - a wild, angry kid.

231
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,892
That's all he's ever been.
And you know why?

232
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:15,687
'Cause he's been hit on the head
by somebody once a day every day.

233
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,981
He's had a -
He's had a pretty miserable 18 years.

234
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:21,026
I - I just think we owe him a few words.
That's all.

235
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,655
I don't mind telling you this, mister.
We don't owe him a thing.

236
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:27,824
He got a fair trial, didn't he?
What do you think that trial cost?

237
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,994
- He's lucky he got it. You know what I mean?
- You know it.

238
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,413
Now, look, we're all grown-ups in here.

239
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,374
We heard the facts, didn't we?

240
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:39,253
You're not gonna tell me that we're supposed
to believe this kid, knowing what he is.

241
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,713
Listen, I've lived among them
all my life.

242
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:45,133
You can't believe a word they say.
You know that.

243
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,052
I mean, they're born liars.

244
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:50,472
- Only an ignorant man can believe that.
- Now listen...

245
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,392
Do you think you were born
with a monopoly on the truth?

246
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:56,061
I think certain things should be
pointed out to this man.

247
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,230
- Come on. This isn't Sunday.
- We don't need a sermon.

248
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,566
- Come on.
- We have a job to do. Now let's do it.

249
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,653
Rice Pops.
It's a product I work on at the agency.

250
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:08,115
"The breakfast with the built-in bounce."

251
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,825
- I wrote that line.
- Very catchy.

252
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,077
- Yeah.
- Say, do you mind?

253
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,870
Oh, I'm sorry.

254
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,415
I have this habit of doodling.
Keeps me thinking clearly.

255
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,208
Yeah, we have all this work to do.

256
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:20,002
- There's no point staying here forever.
- Sorry.

257
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,296
Okay. Um...

258
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,174
perhaps if the gentleman down there
who's disagreeing with us...

259
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,553
Well, perhaps you could tell us why.
You know, let us know what you're thinking.

260
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,014
And we might be able to show you
where you're mixed up.

261
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,765
Well, look, maybe -
Maybe this is an idea.

262
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,268
Now, I haven't given it much thought,
but it seems to me...

263
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:40,772
that it's up to the group of us to convince
this gentleman that he's wrong and we're right.

264
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,400
Now, maybe if we each took
a couple of minutes just to...

265
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,236
Well, it was just a quick idea.

266
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:47,779
No, no, no. That's a good one.

267
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:50,949
Uh, suppose we go
once around the table.

268
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:53,910
- I guess you're first.
- Oh.

269
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,329
Well, uh...

270
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,291
Well, it-it's hard to put into words.

271
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:02,336
I just think he's guilty.

272
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,921
I thought it was obvious
from the word "go."

273
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,506
I mean, nobody proved otherwise.

274
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,133
Nobody has to prove otherwise.

275
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,469
The burden of proof's on the prosecution.

276
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:13,013
The defendant doesn't even
have to open his mouth.

277
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:16,224
- That's in the Constitution.
- Oh, well, sure, I know that.

278
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,268
Uh, what I meant was, is...

279
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:22,064
Well, I just think he's guilty.

280
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,857
I-I mean, somebody saw him do it.

281
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:28,987
Okay. Uh, here's what I think,
and I have no personal feelings about this.

282
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:31,239
I just want to talk about facts.

283
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,368
Number one.

284
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:39,039
The old man lived downstairs under the room
where the killing took place.

285
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,249
At 10 minutes after 12:00
on the night of the killing...

286
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:45,003
he heard loud noises,
said it sounded like a fight.

287
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,964
And he heard the kid yell out,
"I'm gonna kill ya."

288
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,342
A second later,
he heard a body hit the floor.

289
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,135
Ran to the door, opened it up...

290
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,638
saw the kid running down the stairs
and out of the house.

291
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,014
Called the police.

292
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:58,767
They came in, found the old man
with a knife in his chest.

293
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:02,104
The coroner fixed the time of death
around midnight.

294
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:05,273
Now these are facts.
You can't refute facts.

295
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,526
The kid is guilty.

296
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,611
I'm just as sentimental as the next fella.

297
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:13,573
I know he's only 18, but he's still
gotta pay for what he did.

298
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,117
I'm with you.

299
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,744
Okay. Are you finished?

300
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,287
- Yeah.
- Right. Next.

301
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,582
It is obvious, to me anyway,
that the boy's entire story was flimsy.

302
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,876
He claimed he was at the movies
during the time of the killing...

303
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,504
and yet, one hour later, he couldn't
remember the names of the films he saw...

304
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,423
- or who played in them.
- That's right.

305
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,800
And no one saw him going in
or out of the theater.

306
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,510
Listen, what about the woman
across the street?

307
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,887
If her testimony don't prove it,
nothing does.

308
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,306
That's right. She was the one
who actually saw the killing.

309
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,809
- Now, fellas, please.
- Let's go in order here, huh?

310
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,146
Just a minute. Here's a woman...

311
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,690
Here's a woman who was lying in bed.
She can't sleep.

312
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,692
She's dying with the heat.
You know what I mean?

313
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,610
Anyway, she looks out the window...

314
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:54,281
and right across the street she sees
the kid stick the knife into his father.

315
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:57,242
The time is 12:10 on the nose.

316
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,202
Everything fits.

317
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:01,121
Look, she's known the kid all his life.

318
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,331
His window is right opposite hers
across the el tracks...

319
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,083
and she swore she saw him do it.

320
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,836
- Through the windows of the passing el train.
- Right.

321
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:12,090
This el train had no passengers on it.
It was just being moved downtown.

322
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:15,093
The lights were out, remember?
And they proved in court that, at night...

323
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,596
you can look through the windows
of an el train when the lights are out...

324
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,015
and see what's happening
on the other side.

325
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,934
- They proved it.
- I'd like to ask you something.

326
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,687
You don't believe the boy's story.
How come you believe the woman's?

327
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,522
She's one of them too, isn't she?

328
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:32,194
You're a pretty smart fella, aren't you?

329
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,695
- Okay, gentlemen.
- Now, now.

330
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,989
- Now, gentlemen.
- Come on. Sit down. Sit down.

331
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,617
Oh, what's he so wise about?
I'm telling you.

332
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,953
- Okay, now come on.
- Now we're not gonna get anywhere fighting.

333
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,288
Whose turn is it next?

334
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,208
Oh, uh, his. Number five.

335
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,213
Okay, may I - Can I pass? It...

336
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,049
Well, uh, that's your privilege.

337
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,260
Uh, how about the next gentleman?

338
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:00,013
Oh. Well, uh, I don't know.

339
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:04,309
I started to be convinced, you know,
very early in the case.

340
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:09,022
You see, I was looking for a motive.
That's very important.

341
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:13,318
Because if you don't have a motive,
where's your case, right?

342
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,488
Anyway, that, uh, testimony
from those people...

343
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,616
in the apartment across the hall
from the kid's apartment...

344
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,952
that was very powerful.

345
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:24,830
Didn't they say something about a -
a fight and an argument...

346
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:29,334
between the old man and his son
around about, uh, 7:00 that night?

347
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,878
- I mean, I could be wrong, but I -
- It was 8:00.

348
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:34,005
It was 8:00. That's right.
They heard an argument.

349
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,841
They couldn't hear what it was about.

350
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,884
Then they heard
the father hit the boy twice.

351
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:40,929
Finally they saw the boy
run angrily out of the house.

352
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,597
What does that prove?

353
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:46,351
Well, it don't exactly prove anything.
It's just part of the picture.

354
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,354
Well, you said it provided a motive.
The prosecuting attorney said the same thing.

355
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,690
I don't think
that was a very strong motive.

356
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:55,360
This boy's been hit so many times in his
life that violence is practically a...

357
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,821
It's a normal state of affairs with him.

358
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:02,117
I just - I can't see two slaps in the face
provoking him into committing murder.

359
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,787
It may have been two too many.
Everyone has a breaking point.

360
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,417
Anything else?

361
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:12,961
- No.
- Okay.

362
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,796
Uh, how about you?

363
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,592
I don't know. It's all been said.

364
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,762
You can talk here forever.
It's still the same thing.

365
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:26,933
This kid is five for 0.

366
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:28,894
Well, look at his record.

367
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,187
When he was 10,
he was in children's court.

368
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:33,064
He threw a rock at a teacher.

369
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:35,442
When he was 15, he was in reform school.

370
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,360
He stole a car.

371
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:39,946
He's been arrested for mugging.

372
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:42,032
He was picked up twice for knife fighting.

373
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,200
Oh, yeah, they say
he's real handy with a knife.

374
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:47,078
Oh, this is a very fine boy.

375
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:50,165
Ever since he was five years old,
his father beat him up regularly.

376
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,667
- He used his fists.
- Well, so would I.

377
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,252
A kid like that?

378
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:57,505
It's these kids, the way they are nowadays.

379
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:03,178
When I was a kid,
I used to call my father "sir."

380
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,221
That's right. "Sir."

381
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,265
Do you ever hear a kid
call his father that any more?

382
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,851
Fathers don't seem to think
it's important any more.

383
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:12,687
- You got any kids?
- Three.

384
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:15,398
I got one.

385
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,652
Twenty-two years old.

386
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,535
When he was nine years old,
he ran away from a fight.

387
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:32,415
I saw it. I was so embarrassed
I almost threw up.

388
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:38,713
I said, "I'm gonna make a man out of you
if I have to break you in two trying."

389
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,134
Well, I made a man out of him.

390
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,304
When he was 16, we had a fight.

391
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,266
Hit me in the jaw.
He was a big kid.

392
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:55,772
Haven't seen him for two years.

393
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:59,985
Kids.

394
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:03,655
Work your heart out.

395
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:07,492
Well, let's get going.

396
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,911
I think we're missing the point here.

397
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:13,415
This boy, let's say he's the product
of a broken home and a filthy neighborhood.

398
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:17,085
We can't help that. We're here to decide
whether he's innocent or guilty...

399
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,088
not to go into the reasons
why he grew up the way he did.

400
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,882
He was born in a slum.
Slums are breeding grounds for criminals.

401
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,843
I know it, and so do you.

402
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:29,639
It's no secret children from slum backgrounds
are potential menaces to society.

403
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:31,891
- Now I think -
- Brother, you can say that again.

404
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:34,519
The kids who crawl out of these places
are real trash.

405
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,855
- I don't want any part of them. I'm telling you.
- Listen, mister. Listen.

406
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:40,650
- I, uh - I've lived in a slum all my life.
- Wait a minute.

407
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:44,154
Please, I - I played in backyards
that were filled with garbage.

408
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:46,281
I mean, maybe you can still
smell it on me.

409
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,699
Now, listen, sonny.

410
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,367
- Come on now.
- There's nothing personal about this.

411
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:51,995
- No, there was something personal.
- Aw, come on, fella. He didn't mean you.

412
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,164
Let's not be so sensitive.

413
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:56,082
This sensitivity I can understand.

414
00:22:56,167 --> 00:23:00,795
Okay, look, let's stop the arguing.
We're only wasting time, and...

415
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:04,090
Look, your turn down there.
Let's go.

416
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:08,261
Oh, I didn't expect a turn. I thought
you were all gonna try to convince me.

417
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,096
- Wasn't that the idea?
- Check. That was the idea.

418
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:12,390
- Oh, I forgot about that. He's right.
- What difference does it make?

419
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:14,809
He's the one who's keeping us in here.
Let's hear what he's got to say.

420
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,604
Oh, now wait a minute.
We decided to do this a certain way.

421
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:19,314
I think we ought to stick to that way.

422
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,399
Oh, stop being a kid, will you?

423
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:23,485
- What do you mean "a kid"?
- What do you think I mean?

424
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,195
K-I-D. Kid.

425
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:31,451
What? Listen, just because I'm trying
to keep this thing organized?

426
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,661
Here, you take it.
You take on the responsibility.

427
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,622
I'll just - I'll keep my mouth shut.
That's all.

428
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:37,707
What are you getting so hot about?
Calm down, will you?

429
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:39,125
Don't tell me to calm down.

430
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,336
Here. You wanna take the chair,
just take the chair. That's all.

431
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,880
- Did you ever see such a thing?
- See if you can keep it running.

432
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,924
- Listen, you think it's funny or something?
- Hey, forget it, fella.

433
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:47,592
The whole thing's unimportant.
Come on.

434
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:50,804
- Unimportant? Oh, here, you try it.
- No, nobody wants to change.

435
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:52,639
You're doing a beautiful job.
Sit down.

436
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:55,558
Yeah, you're doing great.
Just great, fella.

437
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:57,519
You stay in there and pitch. You know?

438
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,688
All right. Let's hear from somebody.

439
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:06,277
Well, if you want me to tell you how I
feel about it, it's all right with me.

440
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,488
Boy, I don't care what you do.

441
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:11,449
All right, I don't have anything brilliant.

442
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:13,660
I only know as much as you do.

443
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:17,497
According to the testimony,
the boy looks guilty. Maybe he is.

444
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:21,751
I sat there in court for six days
listening while the evidence built up.

445
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,087
Everybody sounded so positive, you know?

446
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,631
I-I began to get a peculiar feeling
about this trial.

447
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,800
I mean, nothing is that positive.

448
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,010
There are a lot of questions
I'd have liked to ask.

449
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:33,805
I don't know. Maybe they wouldn't
have meant anything, but...

450
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,849
I began to get the feeling
that the defense counsel...

451
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:38,434
wasn't conducting a thorough-enough
cross-examination.

452
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:41,896
I mean, he - he let too many things go by,
little things that...

453
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,732
What little things? Listen,
when these fellas don't ask questions...

454
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:47,318
it's because they know the answers already
and they figure they'll be hurt.

455
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:51,322
Maybe it's also possible for a lawyer
to be just plain stupid, isn't it?

456
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:52,699
I mean it's possible.

457
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,450
You sound like you met
my brother-in-law once.

458
00:24:57,538 --> 00:25:00,248
I - I kept putting myself
in the kid's place.

459
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,210
I'd have asked for another lawyer, I think.

460
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:06,838
I mean, if I was on trial for my life...

461
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:11,718
I'd want my lawyer to tear the prosecution
witnesses to shreds, or at least try to.

462
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:15,763
Look, there was one alleged eyewitness
to this killing.

463
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:19,684
Someone else claims he heard the killing,
saw the boy run out afterwards.

464
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,895
And there was a lot
of circumstantial evidence.

465
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:25,481
But actually, those two witnesses
were the entire case for the prosecution.

466
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,358
Supposing they're wrong.

467
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:29,235
What do you mean
supposing they're wrong?

468
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,196
What's the point
of having witnesses at all?

469
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,907
- Could they be wrong?
- What are you trying to say?

470
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:35,533
Those people sat on the stand under oath.

471
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:37,160
They're only people.
People make mistakes.

472
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,953
Could they be wrong?

473
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:42,665
- Well, no, I don't think so.
- Do you know so?

474
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,584
Oh, come on.
Nobody can know a thing like that.

475
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,377
This isn't an exact science.

476
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:47,795
That's right. It isn't.

477
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,720
Okay, let - Let's get to the point.

478
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,389
What about the switch knife
they found in the old man's chest?

479
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,892
Uh, wait-wait a minute.
There's some people who haven't talked yet.

480
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,977
- Shouldn't we go in order?
- They'll get a chance to talk.

481
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,396
Be quiet a second, will you?

482
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:06,773
What about it, this...

483
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:10,318
the knife this fine upright boy
admitted buying the night of the killing?

484
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,736
Let's talk about it.

485
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,072
All right, let's talk about it.
Let's get it in here and look at it.

486
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:15,907
I'd like to see it again.
Mr. Foreman?

487
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:19,077
- We all saw what it looks like.
- Why do we have to see it again?

488
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:21,120
The gentleman has a right
to see exhibits in evidence.

489
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:24,791
Say, could you bring us the knife?

490
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,668
- Knife?
- Yeah. Thank you.

491
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:31,589
The knife and the way it was bought
is pretty strong evidence, don't you think?

492
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:33,341
- I do.
- Good.

493
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,927
Now, suppose we take these facts
one at a time.

494
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:39,264
One. The boy admitted going out of the house
at 8:00 on the night of the murder...

495
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:41,266
after being slapped several times
by his father.

496
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:44,102
No, no. No, he didn't say "slapped."
He said "punched."

497
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:46,604
There's a difference
between a slap and a punch.

498
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:49,274
After being hit several times
by his father.

499
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:51,609
Two. He went directly
to a neighborhood junk shop...

500
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:53,820
- where he bought one of those -
- Switch knives.

501
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:55,905
Switchblade knives.

502
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,782
This wasn't what you'd call
an ordinary knife.

503
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,368
It had a very unusual carved handle
and blade.

504
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,953
The storekeeper who sold it to him...

505
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:05,164
said it was the only one of its kind
he had ever had in stock.

506
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:09,002
Three. He met some friends of his
in front of a tavern about 8:45.

507
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:10,586
Am I right so far?

508
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:12,797
- Yes, you are.
- You bet he is.

509
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:16,050
He talked with his friends for about
an hour, leaving them at 9:45.

510
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:19,095
During this time,
they saw the switch knife.

511
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,972
Four.

512
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,474
They identified the death weapon
in court...

513
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:26,060
as that very same knife.

514
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,938
Five. Ηe arrived home at about 10:00.

515
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:31,357
Now this is where the stories
offered by the State and the boy...

516
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:33,359
begin to diverge slightly.

517
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:36,029
He claims that he went to a movie
at about 11:30...

518
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:40,158
returning home at 3:10 to find his
father dead and himself arrested.

519
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:42,285
He also claims that
the two detectives who arrested him...

520
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,662
threw him down a half a flight of stairs.

521
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:46,581
Now, what happened to the switch knife?

522
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,292
He claims that it fell through a hole
in his pocket on the way to the movies...

523
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:54,047
sometime between 11:30 and 3:10
and that he never saw it again.

524
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:56,090
Now there's a tale, gentlemen.

525
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:59,677
I think it's quite clear that the boy
never went to the movies that night.

526
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:01,721
No one in the house
saw him go out at 11:30.

527
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,306
No one at the theater identified him.

528
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,516
He couldn't even remember
the names of the pictures he saw.

529
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:10,271
- What actually happened is this.
- Thank you.

530
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:13,566
The boy stayed home,
had another fight with his father...

531
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,362
stabbed him to death and left the
house at 10 minutes after 12:00.

532
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:20,198
He even remembered to wipe the knife
clean of fingerprints.

533
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:22,909
Now are you trying to tell me
that this knife...

534
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:24,911
really fell through a hole
in the boy's pocket...

535
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:27,372
someone picked it up off the street,
went to the boy's house...

536
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:30,124
and stabbed his father with it
just to test its sharpness?

537
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,210
No. I'm just saying it's possible
the boy lost his knife...

538
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,504
and that somebody else stabbed his father
with a similar knife.

539
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:35,797
It's just possible.

540
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,465
Take a look at this knife.

541
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:41,594
It's a very unusual knife.

542
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,221
I've never seen one like it.

543
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:46,099
Neither had the storekeeper
who sold it to the boy.

544
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:49,143
Aren't you asking us to accept
a pretty incredible coincidence?

545
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,562
I'm just saying a coincidence is possible.

546
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,147
And I say it's not possible.

547
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,489
Where did that come from?

548
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,949
- Where'd you get that?
- It's the same knife.

549
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:04,534
What do you think you're doing?

550
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:06,244
Where did you get it?

551
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,579
I went out walking
for a couple of hours last night.

552
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:10,665
I walked through the boy's neighborhood.

553
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,751
I bought that at a little pawnshop
just two blocks from the boy's house.

554
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:15,294
It cost six dollars.

555
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:18,506
It's against the law
to buy or sell switchblade knives.

556
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,842
That's right. I broke the law.

557
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:24,929
Listen, you pulled a real bright trick.
Now, supposing you tell me what it proves.

558
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,098
Maybe there are 10 knives like that.
So what?

559
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,976
- Maybe there are.
- Well, what does it mean?

560
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,354
You found another knife like it.
What's that, the discovery of the age or something?

561
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,773
You mean you're asking us to believe
that somebody else did the stabbing...

562
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:37,650
with exactly the same kind of knife?

563
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:38,985
The odds are a million-to-one.

564
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:41,779
- It's possible.
- But not very probable.

565
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,991
Okay, fellas, let's take our seats.

566
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:46,701
There's no point in standing around
all over the place.

567
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:52,165
You know, it's interesting that he'd find a
knife exactly like the one the boy bought.

568
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:55,001
What's interesting about it?
"Interesting."

569
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:56,961
Well, I don't know.
I just thought it was interesting.

570
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,838
There are still 11 of us here
who think he's guilty.

571
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,215
- Right.
- What do you think you're gonna accomplish?

572
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,134
You're not gonna change anybody's mind.

573
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,595
So if you wanna be stubborn
and hang this jury, go ahead.

574
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,723
The kid will be tried again
and found guilty sure as he's born.

575
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,143
That's probably right.

576
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:15,438
So what are you gonna do?
You know, we could be here all night.

577
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:18,774
It's only one night. A boy may die.

578
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:21,402
Well, why don't we just
set up house here, huh?

579
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:23,946
Someone send for Potsy the policeman
and get a pinochle deck...

580
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:26,532
and, uh, we'll just
sweat the whole thing out right here.

581
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:31,078
- I don't think he ought to joke about it.
- What do you want me to do about it?

582
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:34,832
Oh, listen! I don't see what all this stuff
about the knife's got to do with anything.

583
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:37,835
Somebody saw the kid stab his father.
What more do we need?

584
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,713
You guys can talk the ears right off my head.
You know what I mean?

585
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:43,508
I got three garages of mine goin' to pot
while you're talking.

586
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:45,259
So let's get done and get outta here.

587
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:48,763
The knife was very important to the
district attorney. He spent a whole day...

588
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,307
He's a 15th assistant or something.
What does he know about it?

589
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,850
Hey, let's hold it down.

590
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:55,269
These side arguments
are only slowing us up.

591
00:30:58,148 --> 00:30:59,524
Well, what about it?

592
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,108
You're the only one.

593
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,077
I have a proposition
to make to all of you.

594
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:13,913
I'm gonna call for another vote.

595
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:20,586
I want you 11 men to vote
by secret written ballot.

596
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:22,713
I'll abstain.

597
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,591
If there are 11 votes for guilty,
I won't stand alone.

598
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:29,470
We'll take in a guilty verdict
to the judge right now.

599
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:34,642
But if anyone votes not guilty,
we stay here and talk it out.

600
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,898
Well, that's it.
If you want to try it, I'm ready.

601
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:42,441
All right. Let's do it the hard way.

602
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:44,443
Okay, that sounds fair.
Everyone agreed?

603
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,612
- Anyone doesn't agree?
- Fine, fine. Let's go.

604
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:47,738
Here, pass these along.

605
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:49,574
Is that the right time?

606
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:47,465
"Guilty."

607
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:54,180
"Not guilty."

608
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:55,681
"Guilty."

609
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:57,433
Boy, how do you like that?

610
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,977
Oh, and another chap flaps his wings.

611
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:02,813
All right, who was it?
Come on. I want to know.

612
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,149
Excuse me. This was a secret ballot.

613
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,776
We all agreed on that, no?

614
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,986
If the gentleman wanted
to remain secret...

615
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:10,946
Secret? What do you mean secret?

616
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:14,241
There are no secrets in a jury room.
I know who it was.

617
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,911
Brother, you really are something.

618
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,996
You sit here, vote guilty
like the rest of us...

619
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:22,375
and then some golden-voiced preacher
starts tearin' your poor heart out...

620
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:25,753
about some underprivileged kid
just couldn't help becomin' a murderer...

621
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,338
and you change your vote.

622
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,548
If that isn't the most sick...

623
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:33,302
Why don't you drop a quarter
in his collection box?

624
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:35,346
Oh, now just wait a minute.

625
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,014
Listen, you can't talk to me like that.

626
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:38,933
- No. Who do you think you are?
- Calm down. Calm down.

627
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,352
No. Who does he think he is?
Did you hear him?

628
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:44,897
- It doesn't matter. He's very excitable. Sit down.
- Excitable? You bet I'm excitable!

629
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:47,817
We're trying to put a guilty man
in the chair where he belongs!

630
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:50,569
Someone starts telling us fairy tales,
and we're listenin'!

631
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:52,405
Hey, uh, come on, huh?

632
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:54,407
What made you change your vote?

633
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:56,117
He didn't change his vote.

634
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:57,368
I did.

635
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,412
- Oh, fine.
- I knew it.

636
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:01,455
Would you like me to tell you why?

637
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,416
No, I wouldn't like you to tell me why.

638
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,043
I'd like to make it clear anyway,
if you don't mind.

639
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:07,628
Do we have to listen to this?

640
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:09,463
The man wants to talk.

641
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:11,132
Thank you.

642
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:14,552
This gentleman has been
standing alone against us.

643
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:16,887
Now, he doesn't say
the boy is not guilty.

644
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,931
He just isn't sure.

645
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:21,851
Well, it's not easy to stand alone
against the ridicule of others.

646
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:25,062
So he gambled for support,
and I gave it to him.

647
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:26,856
I respect his motives.

648
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,485
The boy on trial is probably guilty,
but, uh, I want to hear more.

649
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,362
Right now, the vote is 10 to two.

650
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:35,698
I'm talking here!
You have no right to leave this room!

651
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,658
He can't hear you. He never will.

652
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:39,326
Let's sit down.

653
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,708
Shall we continue?

654
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,002
Well, I - I think we ought
to take a break.

655
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:52,214
You know, one man's inside,
and I think we ought to wait for him.

656
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:55,259
Okay.

657
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,094
Looks like we're really
hung up here, huh?

658
00:34:58,472 --> 00:35:00,806
And that thing with the old man,
that was pretty unexpected.

659
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:05,352
I wish I could figure out some way
we could break it up.

660
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:11,942
You know, in advertising -
I told you I worked in an agency.

661
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,027
Mm-hmm.

662
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,112
Well, there's some pretty strange people
working there.

663
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:17,281
Well, they're not strange really, I guess.

664
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,992
It's just that they have peculiar ways
of expressing themselves.

665
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,327
You know what I mean.

666
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,621
Of course, I suppose it's the same
in your business too, huh?

667
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,873
What do you do?

668
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,125
- I'm a watchmaker.
- Oh, really?

669
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:31,420
Well, I imagine the finest watchmakers
in the world come from Europe, huh?

670
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:34,507
Anyway, as I was telling you, in an
agency, when we reach a point like this...

671
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:38,093
I'm telling him about, in an ad agency, when
a point like this is reached in a meeting...

672
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:40,805
there's always some character
ready with an idea, see.

673
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,848
And it kills me.

674
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:44,433
It's the weirdest thing in the world...

675
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:47,853
the way they sometimes precede their idea
with a little phrase, see, like...

676
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:50,856
Some account exec will get up,
and he'll say, uh...

677
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:52,775
"Okay, here's an idea.

678
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:56,487
Let's, uh, run it up the flagpole
and see if anyone salutes it."

679
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:59,698
I mean, it's idiotic, but it's funny, huh?

680
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:04,286
I, uh
- I got a little excited back there. I...

681
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,039
didn't mean to get nasty.

682
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:11,710
I'm glad you're not one of those
lets these emotional appeals influence him.

683
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:15,130
Uh...

684
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:31,105
I don't know what's the matter with that fan.
Can't seem to get it to start.

685
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:35,025
♪ Be, be, be ♪

686
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,194
♪ Ba, ba, ba, ba, bum ♪♪

687
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:39,697
Eh!

688
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:43,033
Hey, you a salesman?

689
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:44,618
I'm an architect.

690
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:46,787
Hmm.

691
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:49,123
You know what the soft sell is?

692
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,961
Boy, you got it. Believe me.

693
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,339
I got a different technique.

694
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,925
Laughs, drinks, jokes.

695
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,261
Tricks. You know?

696
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:04,305
Yeah.

697
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,975
"Hit 'em where they live."
That's my motto.

698
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:12,146
I made 27 grand last year
sellin' marmalade.

699
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:15,482
That's not bad. I mean,
you know, considering marmalade.

700
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:20,487
Hey, what are you
gettin' outta this - kicks?

701
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,242
Or did somebody bump you on the head
one time and you haven't gotten over it?

702
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:27,036
Maybe.

703
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:30,581
You know, you do-gooders are all alike.

704
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:33,334
You're always blowing your stacks
over some guy that fanned.

705
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,255
But what are you wasting our time for?

706
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:43,052
Why don't you donate five dollars to the
cause, and maybe it'll make you feel better.

707
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:48,599
This kid is guilty, pal.

708
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,101
It's as plain as the nose on your face.

709
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:53,437
So why don't we stop
wasting our time here?

710
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,440
We're gonna all get sore throats
if we keep it up, you know?

711
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,817
What difference does it make
if you get it here or at the ball game?

712
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:02,780
Oh, no difference, pal.

713
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:04,657
No difference at all.

714
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:18,462
Nice bunch of guys, huh?

715
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,839
Oh, they're about the same
as anyone else.

716
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:23,717
Phew! Boy, what a murderous day.

717
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,762
You think we'll be much longer?

718
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,472
I don't know.

719
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,474
Aw, he's guilty for sure.

720
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,101
Not a doubt in the whole world.

721
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:34,728
We should -
Should've been done already.

722
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,232
Oh, I don't mind, you know.

723
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,734
Hmm. Beats workin'.

724
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:45,572
Uh...

725
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:50,035
You think he's not guilty, huh?

726
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,954
I don't know. It's possible.

727
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:56,500
Well, I don't know you, but I'm bettin'
you never been wronger in your life.

728
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,003
You're wasting your time.
You ought to wrap it up.

729
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:01,255
Supposing you were the one
who was on trial.

730
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,966
Well, I'm not used to supposing.

731
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:08,554
I'm just a workingman.
My boss does the supposing. But...

732
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:10,139
Well, I'll try one.

733
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:17,021
Supposing you talk us all out of this, and,
uh, the kid really did knife his father. Huh?

734
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,239
Are you ready?

735
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,532
Hup.

736
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:29,533
That one.

737
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,285
Sorry, blue eyes.

738
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,622
- Well, where else -
- Okay, fellas, let's take our seats.

739
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,624
Looks like we'll be here
for dinner, huh?

740
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:40,085
Okay, now let's -
Let's get down to business.

741
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,545
Now, who wants to start it off?

742
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,047
- I would.
- Okay, go.

743
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:45,215
You down there.

744
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,178
The old man who lived downstairs says he
heard the kid yell out, "I'm gonna kill ya."

745
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:51,889
A second later,
he heard the body hit the floor.

746
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:55,851
Now, he ran to the door and he saw the kid
running down the stairs and out of the house.

747
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,311
What does that mean to you?

748
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,773
I was wondering how clearly the old man could
have heard the boy's voice through the ceiling.

749
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,900
He didn't hear it through the ceiling.
The window was open.

750
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:04,818
So was the one upstairs.
It was a hot night, remember?

751
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:06,236
Well, it was another apartment.

752
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:08,906
It's not that easy to identify a voice,
particularly a shouting voice.

753
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,574
- He identified it in court.
- That's right.

754
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,117
And don't forget the lady
across the street.

755
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:14,995
She looked right in the open window
and saw the boy stab his father.

756
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,539
- Now, I mean, isn't that enough for you?
- No, it isn't.

757
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:19,583
Boy, how do you like this guy, huh?

758
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,502
It's like talking into a dead phone.

759
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:24,755
She said she saw the killing through the
windows of a moving elevated train.

760
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:28,342
There were six cars on the train.
She saw the killing through the last two cars.

761
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,260
She remembered
the most insignificant details.

762
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:32,387
I don't see how you can argue with that.

763
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:37,017
Has anybody here any idea
how long it would take an el...

764
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,277
Hey!

765
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,862
This isn't a game.

766
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,410
- Did you see him?
- Hey.

767
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:57,246
- The nerve.
- All right, listen...

768
00:40:57,330 --> 00:41:00,582
- The absolute nerve.
- Forget it. It's not important.

769
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:02,626
- "This isn't a game"?
- Calm down.

770
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:06,046
- Who does he think he is?
- I'm telling you, forget it now.

771
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:09,466
Has anybody any idea how long
it takes an elevated train...

772
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:11,385
going at medium speed
to pass a given point?

773
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,345
- What has that to do with anything?
- How long? Take a guess.

774
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:16,098
- I wouldn't have the slightest idea.
- What do you think?

775
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,058
I don't know. Maybe 10, 12 seconds?

776
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,727
I think that's a pretty good guess.
Anyone else?

777
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:23,605
- That sounds right to me.
- Come on. What's the guessing game for?

778
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,524
- What do you say?
- Ten seconds is about right.

779
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,526
All right. Say 10 seconds.
What are you getting at?

780
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:32,656
This. It takes a six-car el train
10 seconds to pass a given point.

781
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:36,994
Now let's say the given point is the open window
of the room where the killing took place.

782
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:40,372
You can reach out of that window
and almost touch the el tracks, right?

783
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,957
Now let me ask you this.

784
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,293
Has anyone here
ever lived near the el tracks?

785
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:48,005
Well, uh, I just finished painting an
apartment that overlooked an el line.

786
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:49,756
- I was there for three days.
- What was it like?

787
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,008
- What do you mean?
- Noisy?

788
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:53,635
Oh, brother. Don't matter though.
We were all punchy.

789
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,305
I lived in a second-floor apartment
near the el line once.

790
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:59,433
When the window was open and the train
goes by, the noise is almost unbearable.

791
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:02,352
- You can hardly hear yourself think.
- All right, you can't hear yourself think.

792
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,855
- Will you get to the point?
- I will. Now just a minute.

793
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:08,567
Let's take two pieces of testimony
and try to put them together.

794
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:12,738
First. The old man in the
apartment downstairs.

795
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:15,407
He says he heard the boy say
"I'm gonna kill you"...

796
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:18,243
and a split second later
heard a body hit the floor.

797
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:19,912
- One second later, right?
- That's right.

798
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:26,001
Second. The woman across the street swore
positively she looked out of the window...

799
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:29,421
and saw the killing through the last two
cars of the passing elevated train, right?

800
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,840
- The last two cars.
- What are you giving us here?

801
00:42:31,925 --> 00:42:33,258
Now, just a minute.

802
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:37,763
We've agreed that it takes 10 seconds
for a train to pass a given point.

803
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:41,934
Since the woman saw the killing
through the last two cars...

804
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:46,980
we can assume that the body
hit the floor just as the train went by.

805
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:51,526
Therefore, the train had been roaring
by the old man's window...

806
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:55,113
a full 10 seconds
before the body hit the floor.

807
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:57,407
The old man,
according to his own testimony...

808
00:42:57,492 --> 00:43:00,410
"I'm gonna kill you," body hitting
the floor a split second later...

809
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:02,955
would have had to hear the boy
make this statement...

810
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,915
with the el roaring past his nose.

811
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,541
It's not possible he could've heard it.

812
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:08,794
- That's idiotic. Of course he heard it.
- Do you think he could've heard it?

813
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:11,255
He said he yelled at the top of his voice.
That's good enough for me.

814
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,590
Even if he heard something, he still
couldn't have identified the voice.

815
00:43:13,675 --> 00:43:14,800
With the el roaring by?

816
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:17,261
You're talking about a matter of seconds!
Nobody can be that accurate.

817
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:21,974
I think testimony that could put a boy into
the electric chair should be that accurate.

818
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:26,103
You know something?
I don't think he could've heard it.

819
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:28,522
Maybe he didn't hear it.
I mean, with all that el noise.

820
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,482
Oh, what are you people talking about?

821
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,609
Well, it stands to reason
he couldn't have heard it.

822
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:34,611
Why should he lie?
What's he got to gain?

823
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:36,905
Attention maybe.

824
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,907
You keep coming in
with these bright sayings!

825
00:43:38,992 --> 00:43:42,035
Why don't you send 'em in to a paper?
They pay three dollars apiece.

826
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,329
What are you talking to him
like that for?

827
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:48,709
Guy talks like that to an old man
really ought to get stepped on, you know?

828
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,627
You ought to have more respect, mister.

829
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:56,216
If you say stuff like that to him again,
I'm gonna lay you out.

830
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:09,146
Now you go ahead.
You - You say anything you like.

831
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:13,275
Why do you think
the old man might lie?

832
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,778
It was just that I looked at him
for a very long time.

833
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:20,657
The seams of his jacket was split,
under the shoulder.

834
00:44:20,742 --> 00:44:22,326
Or did you notice that?

835
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,911
I mean, to come to court like that.

836
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:26,663
Why...

837
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:31,668
He was a very old man
in a torn jacket.

838
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:34,629
And he walked very slowly
to the stand.

839
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:39,426
He was dragging his left leg
and trying to hide it...

840
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,178
because he was ashamed.

841
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:45,724
I think I know this man
better than anyone here.

842
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:52,022
This is a quiet, frightened,
insignificant old man who...

843
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:54,483
who has been nothing all his life...

844
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:56,985
who has never had recognition...

845
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:59,154
or his name in the newspapers.

846
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:02,032
Nobody knows him.

847
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,159
Nobody quotes him.

848
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:08,205
Nobody seeks his advice after 75 years.

849
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,918
Gentlemen, that's a very sad thing -
to be nothing.

850
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:17,964
A man like this needs to be quoted,
to be listened to.

851
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:20,550
To be quoted just once.

852
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:22,511
Very important to him.

853
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:25,430
It would be so hard for him
to recede into the background...

854
00:45:25,515 --> 00:45:27,224
- Wait a minute.
- When there was a chance...

855
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:30,185
What are you trying to do - tell us he'd
lie just so he could be important once?

856
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,896
No. He wouldn't really lie.

857
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,441
But perhaps he made himself believe
he heard those words...

858
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:38,735
and recognized the boy's face.

859
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:41,113
That's the most fantastic story
I've ever heard.

860
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:44,241
How can you make up a thing like that?
What do you know about it?

861
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:55,335
Oh, uh, does anybody
want a cough drop?

862
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,671
- No, thanks.
- I'll take one.

863
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:01,258
You can say what you like. I still don't
see how anybody can think he's not guilty.

864
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:03,844
There's something else
I'd like to talk about for a minute.

865
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,554
Thanks.

866
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:08,932
I think we've proved that the old man couldn't
have heard the boy say "I'm gonna kill you."

867
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,600
- But supposing -
- You didn't prove it at all.

868
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:13,478
- What are you talking about?
- Supposing he really did hear it.

869
00:46:13,563 --> 00:46:15,981
This phrase, how many times
have all of us used it?

870
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:17,566
Probably thousands.

871
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,276
"I could kill you for that, darling."

872
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,278
"Junior, you do that once more,
and I'm gonna kill you."

873
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:22,654
"Get in there, Rocky, and kill him."

874
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:24,614
We say it every day. That doesn't mean
we're really gonna kill anybody.

875
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:26,491
Wait a minute.
What are you trying to give us here?

876
00:46:26,576 --> 00:46:30,287
The phrase was "I'm gonna kill you."
The kid yelled it at the top of his lungs.

877
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:31,705
Don't tell me he didn't mean it.

878
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,082
Anybody says a thing like that
the way he said it, they mean it.

879
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:35,625
Well, gee, now I don't know.

880
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:40,422
I remember I was arguing with a guy I work
next to at the bank a couple weeks ago.

881
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:42,257
He called me an idiot, so I yelled at him.

882
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:45,302
Now listen! This guy's trying to make you
believe things that aren't so.

883
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:47,471
The kid said he was gonna kill him,
and he did kill him.

884
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:50,515
Let me ask you this. Do you really think the
boy would shout out a thing like that...

885
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,392
so the whole neighborhood could hear him?

886
00:46:52,477 --> 00:46:54,311
I don't think so.
He's much too bright for that.

887
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:59,149
Bright? He's a common ignorant slob.
He don't even speak good English.

888
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:02,068
"He doesn't even speak good English."

889
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:08,325
Mr. Foreman, I'd like
to change my vote to not guilty.

890
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:09,826
You what?

891
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:12,329
- You heard me.
- Are you sure?

892
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,664
Yeah, I'm sure.

893
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:17,209
The vote is nine to three,
favor of guilty.

894
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:20,086
Well, if this isn't the living end. Huh?

895
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:26,885
What are you basing it on -
the stories this guy made up?

896
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:29,846
You ought to write for one of those
kooky detective magazines.

897
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:31,765
You'd make a fortune.

898
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:35,268
For crying out loud. The kid's own lawyer
knew he didn't stand a chance.

899
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,354
Right from the beginning,
his own lawyer knew it.

900
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:39,231
You could see it.

901
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:42,901
Boy, oh, boy. I'm tellin' you,
this guy here is really something.

902
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:45,529
Look, the kid had a lawyer, didn't he?

903
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:48,448
He presented his case, not you.
How come you got so much to say?

904
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:51,368
- Look, lawyers aren't infallible, you know.
- Baltimore, please. Huh?

905
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:53,161
He was court-appointed.

906
00:47:53,246 --> 00:47:55,080
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It could mean a lot of things.

907
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:58,416
It could mean he didn't want the case,
or he resented being appointed.

908
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:00,335
It's the kind of case
that brings him nothing...

909
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:03,380
no money, no glory,
not even much chance of winning.

910
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:06,383
That's not a very promising situation
for a young lawyer.

911
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:09,386
He'd really have to believe in his client
to put up any kind of a good case...

912
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:11,471
and, as you pointed out a minute ago,
obviously he didn't.

913
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:14,391
Of course he didn't. Huh.

914
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:16,768
Who the heck could?

915
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:19,771
Except maybe
some guy's mother or somebody. I...

916
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,107
Ah, look.
Will you look at the time, huh?

917
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:24,734
- Come on. For crying out -
- Pardon me.

918
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:27,153
- I have made some notes here -
- Notes.

919
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:29,864
And I would like to -
please, to say something.

920
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:32,200
- Yeah.
- I have been listening very carefully.

921
00:48:32,285 --> 00:48:36,705
And, uh, it seems to me that this man
has some very good points to make.

922
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:41,418
From what was presented at the trial,
the boy looks guilty on the surface.

923
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:45,589
- But maybe if we go deeper?
- Oh, come on, will ya?

924
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:47,966
There is a question I would like to ask.

925
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:51,344
Let us assume that the boy
really did commit the murder.

926
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:54,764
Now, this happened
at 10 minutes after 12:00.

927
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:57,309
Now, how was he caught by the police?

928
00:48:57,393 --> 00:49:01,896
He came back home, uh, at 3:00 or so...

929
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:05,734
and he was captured by two detectives
in the hallway of his house.

930
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:10,405
Now, my question is,
if he really had killed his father...

931
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:13,700
why would he come back home
three hours later?

932
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,661
Wouldn't he be afraid of being caught?

933
00:49:16,746 --> 00:49:18,496
He came home to get his knife.

934
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:21,124
It's not nice to go around leaving knives
sticking in people's chests.

935
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,960
- Yeah, especially relatives.
- Yeah.

936
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:26,296
I don't see anything funny about it.

937
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,924
The boy knew the knife could be identified
as the one he had just bought.

938
00:49:30,009 --> 00:49:32,177
He had to get it before the police did.

939
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:36,723
But if he knew the knife could be identified,
why did he leave it there in the first place?

940
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:40,143
Well, I think we can assume
the boy ran out in a state of panic...

941
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,604
after having just killed his father.

942
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:45,649
When he finally calmed down,
he realized he had left his knife there.

943
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:48,652
Ah. This then depends
on your definition of panic.

944
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:51,112
He would have had to be
calm enough to see to it...

945
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:53,782
that there were no fingerprints
left on the knife.

946
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:57,911
Now, where did this panic start
and where did it end?

947
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,372
Look, you voted guilty.
What side are ya on?

948
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:04,000
I don't believe I have to be loyal
to one side or the other.

949
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:05,877
I'm simply asking questions.

950
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:08,963
Well, this is just off the top of my head,
but, uh...

951
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:11,549
well, if I were the boy
and I'd done the stabbing and everything...

952
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:13,760
I'd take a chance
and go back for the knife.

953
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,346
I'll bet he figured that nobody
had seen him running out...

954
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,932
and that the body wouldn't be discovered
till the next day.

955
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,059
Well, after all,
it was the middle of the night.

956
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:23,645
I'll bet he'd figured nobody
would find the body till the next day.

957
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,730
Pardon. This is my whole point.

958
00:50:25,815 --> 00:50:29,526
The woman across the street testified that
the moment after she saw the killing...

959
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:32,195
that is, a moment
after the train went by...

960
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:35,281
she screamed
and then went to telephone the police.

961
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:38,743
Now, the boy certainly
must have heard the scream...

962
00:50:38,828 --> 00:50:42,330
so he knew
that somebody saw something.

963
00:50:42,415 --> 00:50:45,208
I just don't think
that he would have gone back.

964
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:48,044
Two things. One, in his state of panic,
he may not have heard the scream.

965
00:50:48,129 --> 00:50:49,796
Perhaps it wasn't very loud.

966
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,258
Two, if he did hear it, he may not
have connected it with his own act.

967
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:56,386
Remember, he lived in a neighborhood
where screams were fairly commonplace.

968
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,930
- There's your answer.
- Maybe.

969
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,891
Maybe the boy did kill his father,
didn't hear the scream...

970
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:05,687
did run out in a panic,
did calm down three hours later...

971
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,398
and come back to get the knife,
risking being caught by the police.

972
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:11,401
Maybe all of those things happened,
but maybe they didn't.

973
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:14,237
I think there's enough doubt that we can
wonder whether he was there at all...

974
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:15,989
during the time the killing took place.

975
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,824
What do you mean doubt?
What are you talking about?

976
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,617
Didn't the old man see him
running out of the house?

977
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:21,494
He's twisting the facts, I'm telling you.

978
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:24,914
Did or didn't the old man see the kid
running out of the house at 12:10?

979
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:26,916
Well, did or didn't he?

980
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:30,211
- He says he did.
- "Says he did"? Boy! How do you like that?

981
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:33,256
- Now, look, witnesses can make mistakes.
- Sure, when you want them to, they do.

982
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,592
Or when he wants them to, they do.
You know what I mean?

983
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:37,510
- Keep the yelling down!
- Oh, you keep saying that.

984
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:39,304
Maybe what we need
is a little yelling in here.

985
00:51:39,388 --> 00:51:41,097
These guys
keep going off every which way.

986
00:51:41,182 --> 00:51:43,099
Did hear the scream.
Didn't hear the scream.

987
00:51:43,184 --> 00:51:46,352
What difference does it make? You people
are talking only about the little details.

988
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:48,938
You're forgetting the important stuff.
I mean, all of a sudden, everybody here...

989
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:51,399
- I want to call for another vote.
- I'm talking here!

990
00:51:51,484 --> 00:51:55,153
There's another vote called for.
Now let's take our seats.

991
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:01,576
I never saw so much time
spent on nothing.

992
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,369
It only takes a second.

993
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:07,874
Okay. I guess the fastest way
is to find out who's voting not guilty.

994
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,710
Now, all those voting not guilty,
please raise your hands.

995
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:15,548
Still the same.
One, two, three not guilty. Nine guilty.

996
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:17,300
So, now where are we?

997
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:20,804
I'm telling you, we can yackety-yack until
next Tuesday. Where's it all getting us?

998
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:23,640
Pardon. I vote not guilty.

999
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:26,726
Oh!

1000
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:30,104
What are ya talking about? I mean,
we're all going crazy in here or something.

1001
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:33,983
The kid is guilty.
Why don't you listen to the facts?

1002
00:52:34,068 --> 00:52:36,319
Tell him, will ya?
Now this is getting to be a joke.

1003
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:39,614
The vote is eight to four,
favor of guilty.

1004
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:43,368
What is this, love your underprivileged
brother week or something?

1005
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:45,954
I want you to get up and tell me
why you changed your vote.

1006
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:50,333
- Come on. Give me your reasons.
- I don't have to defend my decision to you.

1007
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,168
There is a reasonable doubt in my mind.

1008
00:52:52,253 --> 00:52:55,255
What reasonable doubt? That's nothing but words.
Here, look at this.

1009
00:52:55,339 --> 00:53:00,260
The kid you just decided isn't guilty
was seen ramming this into his father.

1010
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:02,345
Now, what about this,
Mr. Reasonable Doubt?

1011
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,098
That's not the knife.
Don't you remember?

1012
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,350
Oh, brilliant.

1013
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,727
I'm telling ya, this is the craziest.

1014
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:11,980
I mean, what are we supposed to believe?

1015
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:14,899
I mean, you're sittin' here, you're pulling
stories out of thin air, you know?

1016
00:53:14,984 --> 00:53:18,695
A guy like this, if he's, uh, sitting
ringside at the Dempsey-Firpo fight...

1017
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:21,239
he'd be trying to tell you that, uh...

1018
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:23,700
Look. Now, what about the old man?

1019
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:26,369
Are we supposed to believe that he
didn't get up and run to his door...

1020
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:29,455
and see the kid tearing down the steps
15 seconds after the killing?

1021
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,000
He's just saying so to be important, right?

1022
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:34,878
- I mean, what's the point of the whole thing?
- Wait. Hold it a second, will you?

1023
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:37,171
Oh, and the Baltimore rooter
is heard from again now...

1024
00:53:37,256 --> 00:53:39,215
and pop-ups are fallin' for base hits
wherever we look.

1025
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,552
Hold it a second. Now, look -
Did the old man say he ran to the door?

1026
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:45,597
Ran, walked. What's the difference? He got on, didn't he?
I mean, he got there, didn't he?

1027
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:48,224
- No, now wait a second.
- He said he ran. At least I think he did.

1028
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:51,728
Look, I don't remember what he said, but I
don't see how he could have run to the door.

1029
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:54,188
Ηe said he went
from his bedroom to the front door.

1030
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:55,899
- Now, isn't that enough?
- Where was the bedroom?

1031
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:58,234
- It was down the hall somewhere.
- I thought you remembered everything.

1032
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,570
- Don't you remember that?
- No.

1033
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,864
Mr. Foreman, I'd like to see
a diagram of the apartment.

1034
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:06,200
- Why don't we just have 'em run the trial all over again
so you can get everything straight? - Mr. Foreman.

1035
00:54:06,285 --> 00:54:08,912
How come you're the only one in this room
wants to see exhibits all the time?

1036
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:11,706
- I want to see this one too.
- And I'd like to stop wasting time.

1037
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,626
If we're gonna start wading through all that
nonsense about where the body was found...

1038
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:16,669
We're not,
not unless somebody else wants to.

1039
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:18,463
But I'd like to find out if an old man...

1040
00:54:18,547 --> 00:54:20,924
who drags one foot when he walks
'cause he had a stroke last year...

1041
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:23,426
can get from his bedroom
to his front door in 15 seconds.

1042
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,178
- He said 20 seconds.
- Ηe said 15.

1043
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:27,430
He said 20 seconds.
What are you trying to distort...

1044
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:30,767
- He said 15.
- How does he know how long 15 seconds is?

1045
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:32,518
You can't judge a thing like that.

1046
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:34,979
- He said 15 seconds.
- He was very positive about it.

1047
00:54:35,064 --> 00:54:37,273
He was an old man.
Half the time he was confused.

1048
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:39,651
How could he be positive about anything?

1049
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:51,454
I don't see what you're going to prove here.
The man said he saw the boy running out.

1050
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:53,706
Well, let's see
if the details bear him out.

1051
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,668
As soon as the body hit the floor,
he said he heard footsteps upstairs...

1052
00:54:56,752 --> 00:54:58,419
running toward the front door...

1053
00:54:58,504 --> 00:55:01,589
heard the upstairs door open,
the footsteps start down the stairs.

1054
00:55:01,674 --> 00:55:03,800
He said he got to his own front door
as fast as he could...

1055
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:05,969
and he swore it couldn't have been
more than 15 seconds.

1056
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:07,720
Now, if the killer
began running immediately...

1057
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:10,014
- Maybe he didn't.
- The old man said he did.

1058
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:12,809
You ought to be at Atlantic City
at that hairsplitters convention.

1059
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:16,229
Hey, why don't you stop makin'
smart remarks all the time, huh?

1060
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:19,440
My friend, for your three dollars a day,
you have to listen to everything, you know?

1061
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:21,234
Now that you've got that thing in here,
what about it?

1062
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,486
All right. Here's the apartment
where the killing took place.

1063
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:26,614
The old man's apartment
was directly beneath and exactly the same.

1064
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:29,909
Here are the el tracks, the bedroom,
living room, kitchen, bathroom.

1065
00:55:29,994 --> 00:55:31,995
Here's the hall. Here are the stairs.

1066
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,330
Now, the old man
was in this bedroom right here.

1067
00:55:34,415 --> 00:55:37,083
He says he crossed to the door
and walked down the hall...

1068
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:40,128
opened the front door just in time
to see the boy running down the stairs.

1069
00:55:40,212 --> 00:55:43,548
- Am I right so far?
- That's the story, for the 19th time.

1070
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:47,176
- Fifteen seconds after the body hit the floor.
- Correct.

1071
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:49,303
Now, let's see. It was...

1072
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:53,391
It's 12 feet from the bed to the door.
The hall is 43 feet.

1073
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:56,686
He would have had to walk 12 feet,
open the bedroom door...

1074
00:55:56,770 --> 00:56:00,398
walk 43 feet down and open the front door
all in 15 seconds.

1075
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:03,192
- Do you think he could have done it?
- Sure he could have done it.

1076
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:05,862
He can walk only very slowly.
They had to help him into the witness chair.

1077
00:56:05,946 --> 00:56:07,613
You make it sound like a long walk.

1078
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:10,033
For an old man who had a stroke,
it is a long walk.

1079
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:13,536
- Oh! What are you doing?
- I'm gonna try it, see how long it took him.

1080
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:16,998
What do you mean, you want to try it?
Why didn't his lawyer bring it up if it's so important?

1081
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:20,752
- Maybe he just didn't think about it, huh?
- What do you mean, didn't think of it? You think the man's an idiot or something?

1082
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:22,378
- It's an obvious thing.
- Did you think of it?

1083
00:56:22,463 --> 00:56:24,130
Listen, smart guy.
Don't matter whether I thought of it.

1084
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,424
He didn't bring it up because he knew it would
hurt his case. What do you think of that?

1085
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:30,386
Maybe he didn't bring it up because it would have
meant bullying and badgering a helpless old man.

1086
00:56:30,471 --> 00:56:33,806
You know that doesn't sit very well with a jury.
Most lawyers avoid it if they can.

1087
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:36,601
- So, what kind of a bum is he then?
- That's what I've been asking, buddy.

1088
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:39,729
Pass me that chair, will you?
Those two chairs are the old man's bed.

1089
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:42,690
I just paced off 12 feet across the room.
This will be the bedroom door.

1090
00:56:42,775 --> 00:56:45,401
Oh, that's crazy.
You can't recreate a thing like that.

1091
00:56:45,486 --> 00:56:47,695
- I'd like to see it.
- The hall was 43 feet.

1092
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,781
I'll pace from that wall and back again.

1093
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:54,911
Look, this is absolutely insane.
What are you wasting everybody's time in here for?

1094
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:57,872
According to you, it'll only take 15 seconds.
Now, we can spare that, see.

1095
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:03,503
Come on. Knock it off.

1096
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:05,088
Okay.

1097
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:07,215
Okay. Okay, killer.

1098
00:57:07,299 --> 00:57:08,883
Yeah.

1099
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:13,262
Will you stand right there
and mark the front door?

1100
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:15,848
It was chain-locked according
to the testimony, remember?

1101
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:18,101
- Has anybody got a watch with a second hand?
- I have.

1102
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:20,603
When you want me to start, stamp your foot.
That'll be the body falling.

1103
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:22,605
You can time me from there.

1104
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,774
What are we gonna do, play charades now?

1105
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,901
- Come on! What are we waiting for?
- Okay, I'm ready.

1106
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:28,903
Well, I want to wait
till the second hand reaches 60.

1107
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,905
Oh, come on.

1108
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:40,623
Come on. Speed it up.
He could walk twice as fast as that.

1109
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:44,544
You want me to walk faster than that,
I will.

1110
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:03,896
Lock. Door. Stop.

1111
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:05,982
- Right.
- What's the time?

1112
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:09,318
Uh, exactly 41 seconds.

1113
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:11,654
This is what I think happened.

1114
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:14,574
The old man heard the fight between the boy
and his father a few hours earlier.

1115
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:17,493
Then when he's lying in bed, he heard the
body hit the floor in the boy's apartment...

1116
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:21,080
heard the woman scream from across the street,
got to his front door as fast as he could...

1117
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:23,749
heard somebody racing down the stairs
and assumed it was the boy.

1118
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:25,668
- I think that's possible.
- Assumed?

1119
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:28,254
Oh.

1120
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:34,302
Brother, I've seen all kinds of dishonesty in
my day, but this little display takes the cake.

1121
00:58:34,386 --> 00:58:39,098
You all come in here with your hearts bleeding all
over the floor about slum kids and injustice.

1122
00:58:39,183 --> 00:58:41,184
You listen to some fairy tales.

1123
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:43,561
Suddenly you start getting through
to some of these old ladies.

1124
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:46,606
Well, you're not getting through to me.
I've had enough.

1125
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,733
What's the matter with you guys?

1126
00:58:48,817 --> 00:58:51,527
You all know he's guilty!
He's got to burn!

1127
00:58:51,612 --> 00:58:53,404
You're letting him slip
through our fingers.

1128
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:55,698
"Slip through our fingers"?
Are you his executioner?

1129
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,450
I'm one of 'em!

1130
00:58:58,619 --> 00:59:00,453
Perhaps you'd like to pull the switch.

1131
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,538
For this kid, you bet I would.

1132
00:59:02,623 --> 00:59:05,875
I feel sorry for you. What it must
feel like to want to pull the switch.

1133
00:59:06,752 --> 00:59:10,671
Ever since you walked into this room, you've been
acting like a self-appointed public avenger.

1134
00:59:10,756 --> 00:59:15,051
You want to see this boy die because you
personally want it, not because of the facts.

1135
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:17,303
- You're a sadist.
- You...

1136
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:21,224
Let me go!
I'll kill him. I'll kill him!

1137
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:23,726
You don't really mean
you'll kill me, do you?

1138
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:33,361
Is there anything wrong, gentlemen?
I heard some noise.

1139
00:59:33,445 --> 00:59:37,448
Oh, no. Everything's all right. We're just
- You know, friendly little argument. It's...

1140
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:40,826
Um, listen, we're through with that diagram.
You can take it if you want.

1141
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:43,871
Here you are. Thank you.

1142
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,504
What are you lookin' at?

1143
01:00:12,276 --> 01:00:14,318
I suppose somebody
has to start it off again.

1144
01:00:14,403 --> 01:00:18,114
- I beg pardon.
- "I beg pardon." What are you so polite about?

1145
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:20,283
For the same reason you're not.

1146
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:22,368
It's the way I was brought up.

1147
01:00:24,288 --> 01:00:26,205
This fighting...

1148
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:28,332
That's not why we are here, to fight.

1149
01:00:28,417 --> 01:00:30,793
We have a responsibility.

1150
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:36,549
This, I have always thought,
is a remarkable thing about democracy...

1151
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,509
that we are...

1152
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:42,305
Uh, what is the word?

1153
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:45,474
Notified.
That we are notified by mail...

1154
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:49,895
to come down to this place
to decide on the guilt or innocence...

1155
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:54,025
of a man we have never heard of before.

1156
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:58,654
We have nothing to gain or lose
by - by our verdict.

1157
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:02,700
This is one of the reasons
why we are strong.

1158
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:06,829
We should not make it a personal thing.

1159
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:09,832
Thank you.

1160
01:01:11,043 --> 01:01:13,336
If nobody else has an idea,
I may have a cutie here.

1161
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:16,172
I mean, I haven't given it much thought,
but let's throw it out on the stoop...

1162
01:01:16,256 --> 01:01:17,882
and see if the cat licks it up.

1163
01:01:17,966 --> 01:01:20,301
- The cat licks it up?
- Yeah. If the boy...

1164
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:26,932
Look how dark it's getting out there.

1165
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:29,477
I'll bet we're gonna have a storm now.

1166
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:33,731
Boy, oh, boy. It's really hot, huh?

1167
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:38,027
Pardon me, but don't you ever sweat?

1168
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:41,614
No, I don't.

1169
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,699
Well, listen. I, uh...

1170
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:46,952
I was wondering if, uh, maybe...

1171
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:49,330
maybe we should take another vote.

1172
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:53,709
Oh, great. Maybe we can follow this one up
with a little dancing and refreshments, huh?

1173
01:01:53,794 --> 01:01:55,586
- Hmm.
- Mr. Foreman?

1174
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:59,924
Well, that's okay with me.
Anyone doesn't want to vote?

1175
01:02:00,008 --> 01:02:03,219
- Hey, come on. Come on.
- I'm sorry.

1176
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:06,806
I think we ought to have an open ballot -
call out our votes, you know.

1177
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,100
Let's see who stands where.

1178
01:02:09,184 --> 01:02:11,685
That sounds fair to me.
Anyone object?

1179
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:17,149
Okay. I'll call off your jury numbers.
One.

1180
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:20,945
Oh, that's me. I vote guilty.

1181
01:02:21,029 --> 01:02:22,822
Two?

1182
01:02:22,906 --> 01:02:24,407
Not guilty.

1183
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:27,785
- Number three?
- Guilty.

1184
01:02:28,787 --> 01:02:30,329
Number four?

1185
01:02:31,832 --> 01:02:33,624
Guilty.

1186
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:36,460
- Number five?
- Not guilty.

1187
01:02:37,546 --> 01:02:40,840
- Number six?
- Not guilty.

1188
01:02:41,842 --> 01:02:43,509
Number seven?

1189
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,302
Guilty.

1190
01:02:45,387 --> 01:02:47,430
Number eight?

1191
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:49,181
Not guilty.

1192
01:02:50,517 --> 01:02:53,436
- Number nine?
- Not guilty.

1193
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,688
- Number 10?
- Guilty.

1194
01:02:57,482 --> 01:02:59,525
Number 11?

1195
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,444
Not guilty.

1196
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:03,028
Number 12?

1197
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:06,282
Number 12.

1198
01:03:06,366 --> 01:03:07,867
Guilty.

1199
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,875
The vote is now six to six.

1200
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:19,128
Yeah, right.
And we go into extra innings here, huh?

1201
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:26,051
Six to six. I'm telling you, some of you
people in here must be out of your minds.

1202
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:27,970
A kid like that.

1203
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:31,307
I don't think the kind of boy he is
has anything to do with it.

1204
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:33,476
The facts are supposed
to determine the case.

1205
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,728
Don't give me that!
I'm sick and tired of facts!

1206
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:37,813
You can twist them any way you like.
You know what I mean?

1207
01:03:37,898 --> 01:03:40,483
That's exactly the point
this gentleman has been making.

1208
01:03:40,567 --> 01:03:43,486
- Oh!
- I mean, you keep shouting at the top of your lungs.

1209
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:47,072
I'd like to be a few years younger.

1210
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:49,074
That man gets on my...

1211
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:55,289
- My, it's hot in here, isn't it?
- Do you want a drink of water?

1212
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:59,084
No. No, thanks. Thanks.

1213
01:04:06,927 --> 01:04:08,719
It's gonna rain.

1214
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:11,055
Well, how'd you figure that out, killer?

1215
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:14,183
How come you changed your vote?

1216
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:16,685
Well, it just seemed to me
there was room for doubt.

1217
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:18,979
You haven't got a leg to stand on.
You know that, I hope.

1218
01:04:19,064 --> 01:04:22,066
I don't feel that way.
There were a lot of details that never came out.

1219
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:25,694
- Yeah. Well, good luck.
- Oh, come on. You're like everybody else.

1220
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:27,988
You think too much.
You get mixed up.

1221
01:04:29,241 --> 01:04:33,202
- You know what I mean?
- Now, listen. I don't think you have any right...

1222
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:35,871
Loudmouth.

1223
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:31,093
Look at that come down, will you?

1224
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:34,138
You know...

1225
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:36,724
this reminds me of a storm we had last...

1226
01:05:36,808 --> 01:05:40,269
Oh, when was that? November...

1227
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:43,439
I don't know. Something.
It was quite a storm we had there.

1228
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:45,899
It was right in the middle of a game.

1229
01:05:45,984 --> 01:05:48,611
Uh, we were behind 7-6...

1230
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:51,280
but we just started to move the ball,
right off the tackle.

1231
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:54,158
Started cutting right -
slash here and slash right in...

1232
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:56,035
cut right through.

1233
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:58,621
And, uh...

1234
01:05:58,705 --> 01:06:00,914
We had this kid Slattery, you know?

1235
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:05,461
A real - He was an ox.
You know, a real ox.

1236
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:08,047
I wish I had another one just like him.

1237
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:12,635
I forgot to tell you. I'm the assistant head
coach at the Andrew J. McCorkle High School.

1238
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:14,803
- Oh, yeah?
- That's out in Queens.

1239
01:06:14,888 --> 01:06:17,640
And, uh, anyway...

1240
01:06:17,724 --> 01:06:19,808
we're starting to move along real nice.

1241
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:23,062
Their whole line is just -
they're just coming apart.

1242
01:06:24,356 --> 01:06:28,108
And it starts to come down
cats and dogs, just like this.

1243
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:30,819
Just whoosh - you know, right down.

1244
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:35,491
Well, that was murder, you know?

1245
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:38,160
I swear, I - I nearly bawled.

1246
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:40,579
You just - You couldn't go nowhere.

1247
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,165
Well.

1248
01:06:58,807 --> 01:07:01,308
Hey, what is it with this fan here?
How come...

1249
01:07:09,067 --> 01:07:10,818
Hey! Ηuh?

1250
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:14,196
Must have been
on the same switch with the lights.

1251
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:18,367
Well, things are looking up here, huh?

1252
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:20,536
Yeah, huh?

1253
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:27,376
Boy. That's better.

1254
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,551
Hey!

1255
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:37,302
Two points.

1256
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:43,308
Any of you guys ever go to the Garden?

1257
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:48,480
That's a damn stupid thing to do.

1258
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:50,733
Oh, I'm sorry. I, uh...

1259
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:53,152
You know?

1260
01:07:54,863 --> 01:07:56,363
Pardon me.

1261
01:07:57,449 --> 01:07:59,783
Well, how do you like it?
Even Steven.

1262
01:07:59,868 --> 01:08:02,244
Pretty surprising, isn't it?

1263
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:03,829
Yes.

1264
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:09,126
Say, that business before,
when that tall guy - what's-his-name...

1265
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:11,920
was trying to bait me -
That doesn't prove anything.

1266
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:14,590
I'm a pretty excitable person.

1267
01:08:14,674 --> 01:08:18,510
I mean, where does he come off calling me
a public avenger, sadist and everything?

1268
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:22,097
Anyone in his right mind
would blow his stack, huh?

1269
01:08:22,182 --> 01:08:24,475
He was just trying to bait me.

1270
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:26,560
He did an excellent job.

1271
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:31,565
I'll tell you what I think.
We're going nowhere here.

1272
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:34,193
I'm ready to walk into court right now
and declare a hung jury.

1273
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:36,111
There's no point in this thing
going on any more.

1274
01:08:36,196 --> 01:08:37,529
Yeah. I go for that too.

1275
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:40,449
Listen, let's take it in to the judge and let
the kid take his chances with 12 other guys.

1276
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:43,368
I don't think the judge will accept a hung jury.
We haven't been in here very long.

1277
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:45,120
Well, let's find out.

1278
01:08:45,205 --> 01:08:46,914
I'm not in favor of that.

1279
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:50,209
Listen. This kid wouldn't stand a chance
with another jury, and you know it.

1280
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:53,128
Come on! We're hung. Nobody's gonna
change his vote. Let's take it inside.

1281
01:08:53,213 --> 01:08:55,422
You still don't think there's room
for reasonable doubt?

1282
01:08:55,507 --> 01:08:56,799
No, I don't.

1283
01:08:56,883 --> 01:08:58,175
Pardon.

1284
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:01,512
Maybe you don't fully understand
the term "reasonable doubt."

1285
01:09:01,596 --> 01:09:04,139
What do you mean I don't understand?

1286
01:09:05,225 --> 01:09:07,184
Boy, how do ya like this guy?

1287
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:08,936
I'm tellin' ya, they're all alike.

1288
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:11,855
They come over here, running for their life,
and before they can take a deep breath...

1289
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:14,316
they're telling us how
to run the show, huh?

1290
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,193
Boy, the arrogance of this guy.

1291
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:20,864
Hey, all right. Let's stop
the arguing for about two minutes in here.

1292
01:09:20,949 --> 01:09:23,325
Now, who's got something
constructive to say?

1293
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:26,954
I'd like to go over something,
if you gentlemen don't mind.

1294
01:09:27,038 --> 01:09:29,706
An important point for the prosecution
was the fact...

1295
01:09:29,791 --> 01:09:32,543
that after the boy claimed
he'd been at the movies...

1296
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:34,628
during the hours
that the killing took place...

1297
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:38,590
couldn't remember the names of the movies
or the stars who appeared in them.

1298
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:41,176
This gentleman here has put up that point
in here several times.

1299
01:09:41,261 --> 01:09:42,719
That's correct.

1300
01:09:42,804 --> 01:09:44,680
It was the only alibi the boy offered...

1301
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:47,266
and he himself couldn't back it up
with any details at all.

1302
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:50,602
Putting yourself in the boy's place,
do you think you could remember details...

1303
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:54,147
after an upsetting experience such as
being slapped in the face by your father?

1304
01:09:54,232 --> 01:09:57,442
I think so, if there were
any special details to remember.

1305
01:09:57,527 --> 01:10:00,696
The boy couldn't remember the names of the movies
he saw because be wasn't there that night.

1306
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,823
According to
the police testimony in court...

1307
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:06,034
the boy was questioned by the detectives
in the kitchen of his apartment...

1308
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:09,037
while the body of his father
was lying on the floor in the bedroom.

1309
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:11,707
Do you think you could remember details
under those circumstances?

1310
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:13,792
- I do.
- Under great emotional stress?

1311
01:10:13,877 --> 01:10:16,378
- Under great emotional stress.
- He remembered them correctly in court.

1312
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:18,422
He named the pictures
and the stars who played in them.

1313
01:10:18,506 --> 01:10:21,675
Yes. His lawyer took great pains
to bring that out.

1314
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:24,303
He had three months from the night
of the murder to the day of the trial...

1315
01:10:24,387 --> 01:10:26,013
in which to memorize them.

1316
01:10:26,097 --> 01:10:28,765
It's not difficult for a lawyer to find out
what played at a particular theater...

1317
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:30,517
on a particular night.

1318
01:10:30,602 --> 01:10:34,229
I'll take the testimony of the policemen who
interrogated the boy right after the murder...

1319
01:10:34,314 --> 01:10:36,732
when he couldn't remember
a thing about the movies...

1320
01:10:36,816 --> 01:10:38,734
great emotional stress or not.

1321
01:10:38,818 --> 01:10:42,112
- I'd like to ask you a personal question.
- Go ahead.

1322
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:45,449
- Where were you last night?
- I was home.

1323
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:48,076
- How about the night before that?
- Come on! What is this?

1324
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:49,494
No, it's all right.

1325
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:52,122
I left the office at 8:30
and went straight home and to bed.

1326
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:53,874
And the night before that?

1327
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:56,376
That was, uh, Tuesday night?

1328
01:10:56,461 --> 01:10:58,462
The night of the bridge tournament.
I played bridge.

1329
01:10:58,546 --> 01:10:59,880
Monday night?

1330
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:03,175
When you get down
to New Year's Eve, 1954, let me know, huh?

1331
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:07,137
Monday night?

1332
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:11,391
Monday night, uh,
my wife and I went to the movies.

1333
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:13,101
- What did you see?
- The Scarlet Circle.

1334
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:16,438
- It was a clever whodunit.
- What was the second feature?

1335
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:19,149
The, um...

1336
01:11:19,233 --> 01:11:21,902
I'll tell you in a minute. The, uh...

1337
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:26,156
Remarkable Mrs., uh, something...

1338
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,700
The...

1339
01:11:28,785 --> 01:11:31,453
Mrs. Bainbridge.
The Remarkable Mrs. Bainbridge.

1340
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:34,289
I saw that.
It's called The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge.

1341
01:11:35,583 --> 01:11:37,960
Uh, yes. The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge.
I think that's right.

1342
01:11:38,044 --> 01:11:40,545
Who was in The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge?

1343
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:44,299
Barbara... Long, I think it was.

1344
01:11:44,384 --> 01:11:46,385
A dark, very pretty girl.

1345
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,222
Ling or Long - something like that.

1346
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:53,517
- Who else?
- I'd never heard of them before.

1347
01:11:53,601 --> 01:11:58,021
It was a very inexpensive second feature
with, uh, unknown...

1348
01:11:58,106 --> 01:12:01,233
And you weren't under
an emotional stress, were you?

1349
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:06,279
No.

1350
01:12:06,364 --> 01:12:08,031
I wasn't.

1351
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:11,660
I think the point is made.

1352
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:14,496
Big point!

1353
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,748
You can talk till your tongue
is draggin' on the floor.

1354
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:20,919
The boy is guilty, period.
You know what I mean, my friend?

1355
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:24,256
- Who's got those cough drops?
- They're all gone, my friend.

1356
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:28,510
Oh, boy. Look at that rain.

1357
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:30,971
There goes your ball game.

1358
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:33,473
It's only a shower.

1359
01:12:33,558 --> 01:12:35,726
Besides, they got the infield covered.

1360
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:38,979
Right. Say, could I see that knife
a second, please?

1361
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:44,109
Well, we're still tied up six to six.

1362
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:46,194
Who's got a suggestion?

1363
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:48,280
It's five after 6:00.
Let's get some dinner.

1364
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:50,824
Why don't we wait till 7:00,
give it another hour, huh?

1365
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:53,035
Okay with me.

1366
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:55,287
Uh, there's something I'd like to say.

1367
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:58,915
I mean, it's been bothering me a little,
and as long as we're stuck.

1368
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,878
Well, there was this whole business
about the stab wound and how it was made...

1369
01:13:02,962 --> 01:13:04,588
the downward angle of it, you know?

1370
01:13:04,672 --> 01:13:06,673
Don't tell me we're gonna
start with that again.

1371
01:13:06,758 --> 01:13:08,383
They've been over it and over it.

1372
01:13:08,468 --> 01:13:10,761
Well, I know they did,
but I don't go along with it.

1373
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:14,848
Now, the boy was 5 feet 7 inches tall.
His father was 6'2...

1374
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:17,100
That's a difference of seven inches.

1375
01:13:17,185 --> 01:13:19,853
It's a very awkward thing to stab down
into the chest of someone...

1376
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:21,938
who's more than half a foot
taller than you are.

1377
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:24,149
Give me that.

1378
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:27,027
I'll give you a demonstration.
Somebody get up.

1379
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,322
You...

1380
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:37,537
I want you to watch this 'cause
I don't want to have to do it again.

1381
01:13:37,622 --> 01:13:40,373
I'll make myself about six
or seven inches shorter, okay?

1382
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:43,585
- It's about right. Maybe a little more.
- Okay. A little more.

1383
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:53,804
That's not funny.

1384
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:59,726
Now, nobody's hurt. Right?

1385
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:02,187
Right. Nobody hurt.

1386
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:10,445
Now, this is the way I'd stab a man
who was taller than I was.

1387
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:12,989
Look at the angle - down and in.

1388
01:14:13,074 --> 01:14:15,158
And this is the way it was done.

1389
01:14:15,243 --> 01:14:17,410
Now tell me I'm wrong.

1390
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:23,041
- Down and in. I guess there's no argument.
- Hold it a minute, will ya?

1391
01:14:23,126 --> 01:14:24,960
Can you give me that?

1392
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:27,879
Boy, I hate these things.

1393
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:29,631
- Did you ever see a knife fight?
- No.

1394
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:31,299
- You?
- No.

1395
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:34,177
Anybody here ever see a knife fight?

1396
01:14:34,262 --> 01:14:37,055
Well, I have.
You know, on my back stoop...

1397
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:39,474
the lot across the street, backyard.

1398
01:14:39,559 --> 01:14:41,977
Switchblades came
with the neighborhood where I lived.

1399
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:45,313
It's funny I never thought of it before.
I guess you try to forget those things.

1400
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:48,775
- How do you use a switchblade?
- Well, you'd never use it like this.

1401
01:14:50,528 --> 01:14:52,821
See, you use too much time
switching hands.

1402
01:14:54,574 --> 01:14:57,075
Here's how - underhanded.

1403
01:14:59,787 --> 01:15:02,831
Anyone who's ever used a switch knife
wouldn't handle it any other way.

1404
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:05,542
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

1405
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:07,460
That's why they're made to open like that.

1406
01:15:07,545 --> 01:15:10,172
- You'd say the boy was pretty handy with a knife?
- Mm-hmm.

1407
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:13,425
You think he could have made
the kind of wound that killed his father?

1408
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:17,429
No. Not with the experience he'd had
all his life handling these things.

1409
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:19,514
I feel he'd have gone for him underhanded.

1410
01:15:19,599 --> 01:15:22,642
How do you know? Were you
in the room when the father was killed?

1411
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:24,728
No. Neither was anybody else.

1412
01:15:24,812 --> 01:15:28,023
So what are you giving us all this
mumbo jumbo for? I don't believe it.

1413
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:31,359
I don't think you can determine what type of
wound the boy might or might not have made...

1414
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:34,070
simply because he knew
how to handle a knife.

1415
01:15:34,155 --> 01:15:36,489
What do you think?

1416
01:15:36,574 --> 01:15:38,658
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

1417
01:15:38,743 --> 01:15:40,577
I don't know.

1418
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:46,791
How about you?

1419
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:50,629
I don't know about the rest of them, but I'm getting a
little tired of this yackety-yackin' back and forth.

1420
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:54,174
It's gettin' us nowhere.
So I guess I'll have to break it up.

1421
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:56,801
I change my vote to not guilty.

1422
01:15:56,886 --> 01:16:00,222
- You what?
- You heard me. I've had enough.

1423
01:16:00,306 --> 01:16:02,766
What do you mean you've had enough?
That's no answer!

1424
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:06,811
Hey, listen. You just take care
of yourself, huh? You know?

1425
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:10,857
He's right. That's not an answer.

1426
01:16:10,942 --> 01:16:13,902
What kind of a man are you?

1427
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:17,113
You have sat here and voted guilty
with everyone else...

1428
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:21,451
because there are some baseball tickets
burning a hole in your pocket.

1429
01:16:21,535 --> 01:16:25,789
And now you've changed your vote because you
say you're sick of all the talking here?

1430
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:28,250
Now listen, buddy!

1431
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:33,004
Who tells you that you have the right
to play like this with a man's life?

1432
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:35,590
- Don't you care -
- Now wait a minute!

1433
01:16:35,675 --> 01:16:39,678
- You can't talk like that to me!
- I can talk like that to you.

1434
01:16:39,762 --> 01:16:41,638
If you want to vote not guilty...

1435
01:16:41,722 --> 01:16:44,099
then do it because you are convinced
the man is not guilty...

1436
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:45,976
not because you've had enough.

1437
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:48,645
And if you think he is guilty,
then vote that way.

1438
01:16:48,729 --> 01:16:51,940
Or don't you have the guts
to do what you think is right?

1439
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:54,276
- Now listen.
- Guilty or not guilty?

1440
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:58,655
- I told you, not guilty.
- Why?

1441
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:01,950
Look, I don't have to...

1442
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:05,161
You do have to! Say it! Why?

1443
01:17:05,246 --> 01:17:07,706
All right. I don't, uh, think he's guilty.

1444
01:17:17,216 --> 01:17:18,842
I want another vote.

1445
01:17:18,926 --> 01:17:21,428
Okay. There's another vote called for.

1446
01:17:21,512 --> 01:17:24,389
I guess the quickest way is a show of hands.
Anyone object?

1447
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:27,392
Okay. All those voting not guilty,
raise your hands.

1448
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:33,481
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

1449
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:37,986
eight.

1450
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:44,034
Um, nine.

1451
01:17:45,036 --> 01:17:50,040
Um, all those voting guilty,
raise your hands.

1452
01:17:50,124 --> 01:17:52,500
One, two, three.

1453
01:17:52,585 --> 01:17:55,086
Well, the vote's nine to three
in favor of acquittal.

1454
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:58,256
I don't understand you people!

1455
01:17:58,341 --> 01:18:00,508
I mean, all these picky little points
you keep bringing up.

1456
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:03,928
They don't mean nothing!
You saw this kid just like I did.

1457
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:07,515
You're not gonna tell me you believe
that phony story about losing the knife...

1458
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,601
and that business
about being at the movies.

1459
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:12,687
Look, you know how these people lie.
It's born in them.

1460
01:18:12,772 --> 01:18:14,814
I mean, what the heck.
I don't have to tell you.

1461
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:16,858
They don't know what the truth is.

1462
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:20,653
And let me tell you, they don't need
any real big reason to kill someone either.

1463
01:18:20,738 --> 01:18:22,489
No, sir.

1464
01:18:22,573 --> 01:18:25,617
They get drunk!
Oh, they're real big drinkers, all of 'em.

1465
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:28,870
You know that.
And bang - someone's lying in the gutter.

1466
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:31,956
Well, nobody's blaming them for it.
That's the way they are, by nature.

1467
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:34,125
You know what I mean? Violent!

1468
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:35,710
Where are you going?

1469
01:18:35,795 --> 01:18:38,797
Ηuman life don't mean
as much to them as it does to us.

1470
01:18:39,799 --> 01:18:42,801
Look! They're lushing it up
and fighting all the time...

1471
01:18:42,885 --> 01:18:44,886
and if somebody gets killed,
so somebody gets killed!

1472
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:46,346
They don't care!

1473
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:48,640
Oh, sure, there's some good things
about 'em too.

1474
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:50,683
Look, I'm the first one to say that.

1475
01:18:50,768 --> 01:18:54,062
I've known a couple who were okay, but
that's the exception, you know what I mean?

1476
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:57,899
Most of 'em, it's like they have no feelings.
They can do anything.

1477
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:00,568
What's going on here?

1478
01:19:00,653 --> 01:19:02,695
I'm - I'm trying to tell ya...

1479
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:04,781
you're making a big mistake, you people.

1480
01:19:04,865 --> 01:19:07,867
This kid is a liar!
I know it. I know all about them.

1481
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:11,746
Listen to me.
They're no good.

1482
01:19:11,831 --> 01:19:14,165
There's not a one of 'em who's any good.

1483
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:18,670
I mean, what -
What's happening in here?

1484
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:21,005
I'm speaking my piece, and you...

1485
01:19:22,216 --> 01:19:23,883
Listen to me.

1486
01:19:24,969 --> 01:19:26,428
I...

1487
01:19:26,512 --> 01:19:28,972
We're - This kid on trial here, his type...

1488
01:19:29,056 --> 01:19:31,057
Well, don't you know about them?

1489
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:36,479
Th-There's - There's a danger here.

1490
01:19:36,564 --> 01:19:38,648
These people are dangerous.

1491
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:41,776
They're... wild.

1492
01:19:41,861 --> 01:19:43,778
Listen to me.

1493
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:46,197
- Listen.
- I have.

1494
01:19:46,282 --> 01:19:49,284
Now sit down
and don't open your mouth again.

1495
01:19:53,205 --> 01:19:55,957
I was only trying to... tell you.

1496
01:20:32,453 --> 01:20:36,748
It's always difficult to keep personal
prejudice out of a thing like this.

1497
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:41,878
Wherever you run into it,
prejudice always obscures the truth.

1498
01:20:43,464 --> 01:20:45,840
I don't really know what the truth is.

1499
01:20:45,925 --> 01:20:48,843
I don't suppose anybody
will ever really know.

1500
01:20:50,137 --> 01:20:54,098
Nine of us now seem to feel
that the defendant is innocent.

1501
01:20:54,183 --> 01:20:57,185
But we're just gambling on probabilities.

1502
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:59,229
We may be wrong.

1503
01:20:59,313 --> 01:21:01,689
We may be trying to let
a guilty man go free.

1504
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:03,233
I don't know.

1505
01:21:03,317 --> 01:21:05,318
Nobody really can.

1506
01:21:05,402 --> 01:21:07,779
But we have a reasonable doubt...

1507
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:11,366
and that's something
that's very valuable in our system.

1508
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:15,995
No jury can declare a man guilty
unless it's sure.

1509
01:21:17,456 --> 01:21:19,832
We nine can't understand...

1510
01:21:19,917 --> 01:21:22,627
how you three are still so sure.

1511
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:25,463
- Maybe you can tell us.
- I'll try.

1512
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:30,343
You've made some excellent points, but I
still believe the boy is guilty of murder...

1513
01:21:30,427 --> 01:21:32,136
and I have two reasons.

1514
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:35,348
One, the evidence
given by the woman across the street...

1515
01:21:35,432 --> 01:21:38,059
who actually saw the murder committed.

1516
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:40,728
As far as I'm concerned,
that's the most important testimony.

1517
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:44,065
And two, the fact that she
described the stabbing by saying...

1518
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:49,779
she saw the boy raise his arm over his head
and stab down into the father's chest.

1519
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:51,906
She saw him do it the wrong way.

1520
01:21:51,991 --> 01:21:53,908
That's absolutely right.

1521
01:21:53,993 --> 01:21:56,578
Let's talk about this woman for a moment.

1522
01:21:56,662 --> 01:21:59,747
She said she went to bed
about 11:00 that night.

1523
01:21:59,832 --> 01:22:03,418
Her bed was next to the window,
and she could look out while lying down...

1524
01:22:03,502 --> 01:22:07,589
and see directly into the boy's room
across the street.

1525
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:10,300
She tossed and turned for over an hour,
unable to sleep.

1526
01:22:10,384 --> 01:22:14,554
Finally, she turned toward the window
at about 10 minutes after 12:00...

1527
01:22:14,638 --> 01:22:19,767
and, as she looked out, she saw the killing
through the windows of a passing el train.

1528
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:22,562
She said the lights went out
immediately after the killing...

1529
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:27,442
but that she got a good look at the boy
in the act of stabbing his father.

1530
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:32,280
As far as I can see it,
this is unshakable testimony.

1531
01:22:33,032 --> 01:22:35,700
- Well, that's the whole case.
- What do you think?

1532
01:22:41,081 --> 01:22:42,749
How about you?

1533
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:46,836
I-I don't know.

1534
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:48,921
So much evidence to sift.

1535
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:50,965
This is a pretty complicated business.

1536
01:22:51,050 --> 01:22:54,844
Frankly, I don't see
how you can vote for acquittal.

1537
01:22:54,928 --> 01:22:57,263
It's not so easy to arrange
all the evidence in order.

1538
01:22:57,348 --> 01:22:59,390
You can throw out
all the other evidence!

1539
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:03,061
The woman saw him do it!
What else do you want?

1540
01:23:03,145 --> 01:23:05,021
- Yeah, well, maybe -
- Let's vote on it.

1541
01:23:05,105 --> 01:23:07,273
Okay. There's another vote called for.

1542
01:23:07,358 --> 01:23:09,192
Anybody object?

1543
01:23:09,276 --> 01:23:12,320
All right. I'm changing my vote.
He's guilty.

1544
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:14,822
Anybody else?
The vote is eight to four.

1545
01:23:14,907 --> 01:23:18,493
Why is this such a personal triumph
for you - this one vote?

1546
01:23:18,577 --> 01:23:22,038
Okay. I say we're a hung jury.
I say we take it in to the judge.

1547
01:23:22,122 --> 01:23:24,832
Ηow about it?
I want to hear arguments.

1548
01:23:24,917 --> 01:23:27,418
You, you're the leader of the cause.
What about it?

1549
01:23:29,672 --> 01:23:31,506
Let's go over it again.

1550
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:33,508
We've been over it again!

1551
01:23:33,592 --> 01:23:38,388
The boy in the gray flannel suit here is bouncin'
backwards and forwards like a tennis ball.

1552
01:23:38,472 --> 01:23:42,308
No point in getting nasty
and trying to turn this into a contest.

1553
01:23:44,269 --> 01:23:45,728
Okay.

1554
01:23:45,813 --> 01:23:48,856
Maybe we can talk about
setting some kind of time limit.

1555
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:51,067
Yeah, once around for the deal, huh?

1556
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:55,530
It's a quarter after 6:00.

1557
01:23:55,614 --> 01:23:57,573
Someone before mentioned 7:00.

1558
01:23:57,658 --> 01:24:00,034
I think that's a point at which
we might begin to discuss...

1559
01:24:00,119 --> 01:24:03,371
the question of whether
we're a hung jury or not.

1560
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:05,123
Don't you feel well?

1561
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:08,418
I feel perfectly well, thank you.

1562
01:24:08,502 --> 01:24:11,212
I was saying that 7:00
would be a reasonable time.

1563
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:14,215
Uh, the reason I asked about that
was because, uh...

1564
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:15,883
you were rubbing your nose like...

1565
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:18,636
Oh, I'm sorry for interrupting...

1566
01:24:18,721 --> 01:24:21,931
but you made a gesture
that reminded me of something.

1567
01:24:22,015 --> 01:24:24,058
I'm trying to settle something here.
Do you mind?

1568
01:24:24,143 --> 01:24:26,144
Well, I think this is important.

1569
01:24:27,229 --> 01:24:29,021
Thank you.

1570
01:24:29,106 --> 01:24:31,733
Now then,
I'm sure you'll pardon me for this...

1571
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:34,736
but I was wondering why
you were rubbing your nose like that.

1572
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:36,487
Oh, come on, will ya?

1573
01:24:36,572 --> 01:24:40,742
At this point, I happen to be talking
to the gentleman sitting next to you!

1574
01:24:40,826 --> 01:24:44,078
Now, why were you rubbing
your nose like that?

1575
01:24:44,163 --> 01:24:48,249
Well, if it's any of your business, I was
rubbing it because it bothers me a little.

1576
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:49,959
Oh. I'm sorry.

1577
01:24:50,043 --> 01:24:53,921
- Is it - Is it because of your eyeglasses?
- It is.

1578
01:24:54,006 --> 01:24:55,757
Now can we get on to something else?

1579
01:24:55,841 --> 01:25:00,428
Your eyeglasses made those two
deep impressions on the sides of your nose.

1580
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:02,680
I hadn't noticed that before.

1581
01:25:02,765 --> 01:25:06,267
- That must be annoying.
- It is very annoying.

1582
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:08,269
Well, I wouldn't know about that.

1583
01:25:08,353 --> 01:25:11,689
I've never worn eyeglasses.
Twenty-twenty.

1584
01:25:11,774 --> 01:25:14,317
Listen, will you come on already
with the optometrist bit?

1585
01:25:16,236 --> 01:25:19,781
The woman who testified
that she saw the killing...

1586
01:25:19,865 --> 01:25:23,409
had those same marks
on the sides of her nose.

1587
01:25:24,411 --> 01:25:26,621
Holy smokes! You know, he's right.

1588
01:25:26,705 --> 01:25:28,372
Please.

1589
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:32,210
Just give me a minute,
and I'll be finished.

1590
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:35,129
I don't know if anyone else
noticed that about her.

1591
01:25:35,214 --> 01:25:39,091
I didn't think of it then,
but I've been going over her face...

1592
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:42,261
in my mind.

1593
01:25:42,346 --> 01:25:44,347
She had those same marks.

1594
01:25:45,349 --> 01:25:49,519
- She kept rubbing them in court.
- He's right. She did do that a lot.

1595
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:55,233
This woman was about, uh -
about 45 years old.

1596
01:25:55,317 --> 01:25:59,278
She was making a tremendous effort
to look 35...

1597
01:25:59,363 --> 01:26:01,572
for her first public appearance.

1598
01:26:01,657 --> 01:26:04,909
Heavy makeup, dyed hair...

1599
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:08,871
brand-new clothes that should have
been worn by a younger woman.

1600
01:26:08,956 --> 01:26:10,623
No glasses.

1601
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:12,375
No, women do that.

1602
01:26:12,459 --> 01:26:14,877
See if you can get the
mental picture of it.

1603
01:26:14,962 --> 01:26:16,796
What do you mean, no glasses?

1604
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,590
How do you know whether she wore glasses?
Just 'cause she was rubbing her nose?

1605
01:26:19,675 --> 01:26:21,884
Now, she had those marks. I saw 'em.

1606
01:26:21,969 --> 01:26:23,886
So what?
What do ya think that means?

1607
01:26:23,971 --> 01:26:27,181
- Listen, I'm getting so sick of your yelling in here!
- Come on. Forget it.

1608
01:26:27,266 --> 01:26:30,268
Hey, listen. Listen, he's right.
I saw them too.

1609
01:26:30,352 --> 01:26:33,479
I was the closest one to her. She had these,
uh - these things on the side of her nose.

1610
01:26:33,564 --> 01:26:36,774
- What do you call those on the side?
- Well, what point are you making here?

1611
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:40,736
She had dyed hair, marks on her nose.
Well, what does that mean?

1612
01:26:40,821 --> 01:26:45,116
Could those marks be made
by anything other than eyeglasses?

1613
01:26:48,704 --> 01:26:51,038
No, they couldn't.

1614
01:26:51,123 --> 01:26:53,124
I didn't see any marks!

1615
01:26:54,751 --> 01:26:56,460
I did.

1616
01:26:56,545 --> 01:26:59,088
Strange, but I didn't
think about it before.

1617
01:26:59,172 --> 01:27:01,299
Well, what about the lawyer?
Why didn't he say something?

1618
01:27:01,383 --> 01:27:04,302
There are 12 people in here
concentrating on this case.

1619
01:27:04,386 --> 01:27:06,470
Eleven of us didn't think of it either.

1620
01:27:06,555 --> 01:27:09,724
Well, what about the district attorney?
Do you think he'd pull a trick like that?

1621
01:27:09,808 --> 01:27:11,684
Have her testify without her glasses?

1622
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:15,730
Did you ever see a woman who had to wear glasses and
didn't want to because she thinks they spoil her looks?

1623
01:27:15,814 --> 01:27:19,317
Okay. She had marks on her nose.

1624
01:27:19,401 --> 01:27:23,070
I'm giving you that.
From glasses, right?

1625
01:27:23,155 --> 01:27:27,325
She didn't want to wear 'em out of the house
so people would think she's gorgeous.

1626
01:27:27,409 --> 01:27:31,996
But when she saw this kid killing his
father, she was in the house alone.

1627
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:34,290
That's all.

1628
01:27:34,374 --> 01:27:38,377
- Do you wear glasses when you go to bed?
- No, I don't.

1629
01:27:40,088 --> 01:27:42,006
No one wears eyeglasses to bed.

1630
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:45,092
It's logical to assume that she wasn't
wearing them when she was in bed...

1631
01:27:45,177 --> 01:27:46,928
tossing and turning, trying to fall asleep.

1632
01:27:47,012 --> 01:27:49,347
- How do you know?
- I don't know! I'm guessing.

1633
01:27:49,431 --> 01:27:51,891
I'm also guessing that she probably
didn't put her glasses on...

1634
01:27:51,975 --> 01:27:54,101
when she turned
to look casually out of the window.

1635
01:27:54,186 --> 01:27:56,938
And she herself testified the killing
took place just as she looked out.

1636
01:27:57,022 --> 01:28:00,066
The lights went off a split second later.
She couldn't have had time to put them on then.

1637
01:28:00,150 --> 01:28:01,776
- Wait a second.
- Here's another guess.

1638
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:05,947
Maybe she honestly thought she saw the boy
kill his father. I say she only saw a blur.

1639
01:28:06,031 --> 01:28:09,617
How do you know what she saw?
How does he know all that?

1640
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:12,453
How do you know what kind of glasses she wore?
Maybe they were sunglasses.

1641
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:15,164
Maybe she was farsighted.
What do you know about it?

1642
01:28:15,248 --> 01:28:18,501
I only know the woman's eyesight
is in question now.

1643
01:28:18,585 --> 01:28:24,715
She had to be able to identify a person
60 feet away, at night, without glasses.

1644
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:27,176
You can't send someone off to die
on evidence like that.

1645
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:29,261
Oh, don't give me that.

1646
01:28:29,346 --> 01:28:31,514
Don't you think the woman
might have made a mistake?

1647
01:28:31,598 --> 01:28:34,016
- No.
- It's not possible?

1648
01:28:34,101 --> 01:28:35,726
No, it's not possible.

1649
01:28:38,689 --> 01:28:40,606
Is it possible?

1650
01:28:41,733 --> 01:28:43,401
Not guilty.

1651
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:50,241
Do you think he's guilty?

1652
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:52,326
I think he's guilty.

1653
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:56,747
Do you?

1654
01:28:59,626 --> 01:29:02,670
No. I'm convinced.

1655
01:29:02,754 --> 01:29:04,338
Not guilty.

1656
01:29:04,423 --> 01:29:06,215
What's the matter with you?

1657
01:29:06,299 --> 01:29:08,217
I have a reasonable doubt now.

1658
01:29:08,301 --> 01:29:09,844
Eleven to one.

1659
01:29:09,928 --> 01:29:12,847
Well, what about all the other evidence?
What about all that stuff?

1660
01:29:12,931 --> 01:29:15,016
The knife, the whole business!

1661
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:18,019
Well, you said we could throw out
all the other evidence.

1662
01:29:23,775 --> 01:29:25,943
Well, what do we do now?

1663
01:29:28,947 --> 01:29:30,614
You're alone.

1664
01:29:30,699 --> 01:29:34,535
I don't care whether I'm alone or not!
It's my right.

1665
01:29:37,706 --> 01:29:39,874
It's your right.

1666
01:29:49,009 --> 01:29:51,427
Well, what do you want?
I say he's guilty.

1667
01:29:53,055 --> 01:29:56,390
- We want to hear your arguments.
- I gave you my arguments.

1668
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:59,518
We're not convinced.

1669
01:29:59,603 --> 01:30:02,396
We want to hear them again.

1670
01:30:02,481 --> 01:30:04,482
We have as much time as it takes.

1671
01:30:10,155 --> 01:30:14,617
Everything - Every single thing
that took place in that courtroom...

1672
01:30:14,701 --> 01:30:16,619
but I mean everything -
says he's guilty.

1673
01:30:16,703 --> 01:30:19,163
What do you think,
I'm an idiot or something?

1674
01:30:20,832 --> 01:30:22,917
Why don't you take that stuff
about the old man?

1675
01:30:23,001 --> 01:30:26,170
The old man who lived there
and heard everything.

1676
01:30:27,839 --> 01:30:29,507
Or this business about the knife.

1677
01:30:29,591 --> 01:30:31,592
What? 'Cause he found another one
exactly like it?

1678
01:30:31,676 --> 01:30:35,012
The old man saw him
right there on the stairs!

1679
01:30:35,097 --> 01:30:37,932
What's the difference
how many seconds it was?

1680
01:30:39,101 --> 01:30:41,102
Every single thing.

1681
01:30:42,521 --> 01:30:45,689
The knife falling through
a hole in his pocket.

1682
01:30:45,774 --> 01:30:49,110
You can't prove he didn't get to the door.

1683
01:30:49,194 --> 01:30:51,612
Sure, you can take all the time,
hobble around the room.

1684
01:30:51,696 --> 01:30:54,281
But you can't prove it!

1685
01:30:56,201 --> 01:30:59,829
And what about this business
of the el and the movies?

1686
01:30:59,913 --> 01:31:02,957
There's a phony deal
if I ever heard one.

1687
01:31:03,041 --> 01:31:07,253
I'll bet ya $5,000
I'd remember the movies I saw.

1688
01:31:07,337 --> 01:31:09,588
I'm telling ya,
everything that's gone on...

1689
01:31:09,673 --> 01:31:13,509
has been twisted and turned!

1690
01:31:13,593 --> 01:31:15,678
This business with the glasses?

1691
01:31:15,762 --> 01:31:21,308
How do you know she didn't have them on?
This woman testified in open court!

1692
01:31:21,393 --> 01:31:25,354
And what about hearing the kid yell, huh?

1693
01:31:25,438 --> 01:31:28,691
I'm telling ya, I've got
all the facts here.

1694
01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:31,735
Here. Ah...

1695
01:31:34,114 --> 01:31:36,615
Well, that's it!
That's the whole case.

1696
01:31:43,832 --> 01:31:45,416
Well?

1697
01:31:47,711 --> 01:31:49,712
Say something!

1698
01:31:54,843 --> 01:31:58,429
You lousy bunch of bleeding hearts.

1699
01:31:59,097 --> 01:32:01,015
You're not gonna intimidate me.

1700
01:32:01,099 --> 01:32:03,601
I'm entitled to my opinion.

1701
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:11,275
Rotten kids.
You work your life out!

1702
01:32:16,114 --> 01:32:18,073
I can't keep...

1703
01:32:22,746 --> 01:32:24,413
No.

1704
01:32:28,293 --> 01:32:30,127
Not guilty.

1705
01:32:33,506 --> 01:32:35,174
Not guilty.

1706
01:32:38,178 --> 01:32:39,803
Not...

1707
01:32:50,357 --> 01:32:52,524
Um, we're ready now.

1708
01:34:46,181 --> 01:34:47,848
Hey!
