(MAN LAUGHING)

6
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:19,105
To continue, you've listened
to a long and complex case,

7
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:21,077
murder in the first degree.

8
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:26,175
Premeditated murder is the most
serious charge tried in our criminal courts.

9
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:27,913
You've listened to the testimony,

10
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:31,047
you've had the law read to you
and interpreted as it applies in this case.

11
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:32,419
It's now your duty to sit down

12
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:34,925
and try and separate
the facts from the fancy.

13
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:39,890
One man is dead.
Another man's life is at stake.

14
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:44,197
If there's a reasonable doubt in your
minds as to the guilt of the accused,

15
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:48,798
a reasonable doubt, then you must
bring me a verdict of not guilty.

16
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:53,010
Lf, however, there's no reasonable doubt,
then you must, in good conscience,

17
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:55,904
find the accused guilty.

18
00:01:56,382 --> 00:02:00,216
However you decide,
your verdict must be unanimous.

19
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,721
In the event that
you find the accused guilty,

20
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:07,122
the bench will not entertain
a recommendation for mercy.

21
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,787
The death sentence
is mandatory in this case.

You know something?
I called the Weather Bureau this morning.

31

This is going to be
the hottest day of the year.

32
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:13,011
You'd think they'd at least
air-condition these places.

- What is your name, sir?
- Oh, it's that one. Yeah.

Thank you very much.
Okay, gentlemen. Everybody's here.

00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,481
Now, if there's anything you want,
I'll be right outside the door. Just knock.

I never knew they locked the door.

00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,408
Sure they lock the door.
What did you think?

40
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,579
I don't know. It just never occurred to me.

41
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:50,479
What's that for?

42
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,517
Oh, I thought
we might want to vote by ballot.

43
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:56,577
Great idea.
Maybe we can get him elected senator.

- How'd you like it?
- Oh, I don't know.

It was pretty interesting.

46
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:11,262
- Yeah? I almost fell asleep.
- I mean, I've never been on a jury before.

47
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,566
No? I've sat on many juries.

48
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:18,001
What gets me is the way
those lawyers talk and talk and talk,

49
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,306
even when it's an open-and-shut case
like this one.

50
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,244
I mean, did you ever hear
so much talk about nothing?

51

Well, I guess they're entitled.

52
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:28,543
They're entitled.
It's the system, but, if you ask me,

53
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:32,317
I'd slap those tough kids down
before they start any trouble.

No real dead spots.
You know what I mean?

I tell you,
we were lucky to get a murder case.

And, well, we can vote on it
right now, then.

Yeah, let's vote. Who knows?
Maybe we can all get out of here.

Uh-huh.

140
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:50,381
Okay. Then I think that,
of course, you know that

we have
a first-degree murder charge here,

we've got to send him to the chair.

Yeah, let's see who's where.

- Okay. Anyone doesn't want to vote?
- It's fine with me.

146
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:13,962
Okay, then, just remember that this
has to be twelve to nothing, either way.

147
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:16,974
That's the law. Okay, are we ready?

please raise your hands.

eight, nine, ten, eleven.

151
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,322
Okay, that's eleven guilty.

152
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,595
Those voting not guilty?

153
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,055
One. Right.

154
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:44,559
Eleven guilty, one not guilty.
Well, now we know where we are.

155
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,662
Boy, oh, boy! There's always one.

156
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:51,568
So, what do we do now?

157
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:54,737
- I guess we talk.
- Boy, oh, boy!

158
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:57,645
You really think he's innocent?

159
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,011
I don't know.

160
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:04,589
You sat in court with the rest of us.
You heard what we did.

161
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,851
The kid's a dangerous killer,
you could see it.

162
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,417
- He's 18 years old.
- Well, that's old enough.

163
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:13,362
He stabbed his own father
four inches into the chest.

164
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,900
They proved it
a dozen different ways in court.

165
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:20,097
- Would you like me to list them for you?
- No.

166
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:23,198
- Then what do you want?
- I just want to talk.

167
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:26,301
What's there to talk about?
Eleven men in here think he's guilty.

168
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,710
No one had to think about it twice,
except you.

169
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:31,908
I want to ask you something.
Do you believe his story?

170
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:34,542
I don't know whether I believe it or not.
Maybe I don't.

171
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:36,644
So how come you vote not guilty?

172
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,451
There were 11 votes for guilty.

173
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:39,854
It's not easy to raise my hand

174
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,417
and send a boy off to die
without talking about it first.

175
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,089
- Well, now, who says it's easy?
- No one.

176
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:52,032
What? Just because I voted fast?
I honestly think the guy is guilty.

177
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,629
Couldn't change my mind
if you talked for 100 years.

178
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,504
I'm not trying to change your mind.
It's just that...

179
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,171
We're talking about somebody's life here.
We can't decide it in five minutes.

180
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,441
- Supposing we're wrong?
- Supposing we're wrong.

181
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,312
Supposing this building
should fall down on my head?

182
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:08,011
- You can suppose anything.
- That's right.

183
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,578
What's the difference how long it takes?

184
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:13,453
Supposing we do it in five minutes?
So what?

185
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:18,292
Let's take an hour.
The ball game doesn't start till 8:00.

186
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:26,366
- Who's got something to say?
- I'm willing to sit for an hour.

187
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,940
Great. I heard a pretty good story
last night...

188
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,066
That's not why we're sitting here.

189
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:35,606
All right, then you tell me.
What are we sitting here for?

190
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,246
I don't know. Maybe no reason.

191
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:43,247
Look, this kid's been
kicked around all of his life.

192
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:47,121
You know, born in a slum,
mother dead since he was nine.

193
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,716
He lived for a year and a half
in an orphanage

194
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:52,525
when his father was
serving a jail term for forgery.

195
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:55,099
That's not a very happy beginning.

196
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:58,637
He's a wild, angry kid, that's all
he's ever been. And you know why?

197
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:02,969
Because he's been hit on the head
by somebody once a day, every day.

198
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:05,908
He's had a pretty miserable 18 years.

199
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,241
I just think
we owe him a few words, that's all.

200
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,680
I don't mind telling you this, mister.
We don't owe him a thing.

201
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:12,910
He got a fair trial, didn't he?

202
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:17,751
What do you think that trial cost?
He's lucky he got it. Know what I mean?

203
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:22,317
Look, we're all grown-ups in here.
We heard the facts, didn't we?

204
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,828
You're not going to tell me
that we're supposed to believe this kid,

205
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,363
knowing what he is.

206
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,660
Listen, I've lived among them all my life.

207
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:33,966
You can't believe a word they say.
You know that. I mean, they're born liars.

208
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:37,474
- Only an ignorant man can believe that.
- Now, listen...

209
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:40,272
Do you think you were born
with a monopoly on the truth?

210
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,075
I think certain things
should be pointed out to this man.

211
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,275
JUROR #7: Come on, this isn't Sunday.
We don't need a sermon.

212
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,614
JUROR #1: Come on, we have a job to do,
now let's do it.

213
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:52,590
Rice Pops.
It's a product I work on at the agency.

214
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:55,182
"The breakfast with the built-in bounce."

215
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,319
- I wrote that line.
- Very catchy.

216
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:00,830
- Say, do you mind?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

217
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,423
I have this habit of doodling.

218
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:05,094
- It keeps me thinking clearly.
- We have all this work to do.

219
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:07,001
- There's no point staying here forever.
- I'm sorry.

220
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,130
Okay.

221
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:13,140
Now perhaps if the gentleman down there
who's disagreeing with us,

222
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,644
well, perhaps you could tell us why.

223
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,271
You know, let us know
what you're thinking

224
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,112
and we might be able to show you
where you're mixed up.

225
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:22,483
Well, look, maybe this is an idea.
Now, I haven't given it much thought,

226
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:26,217
but it seems to me that it's up to
the group of us to convince this gentleman

227
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:27,758
that he's wrong and we're right.

228
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,728
Now, maybe if we each took
a couple of minutes just to...

229
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:35,766
- Well, it was just a quick idea.
- No, no, no. That's a good one.

230
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,802
Supposing we go once around the table?

231
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,137
I guess you're first.

232
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,007
Well I...

233
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,509
It's hard to put into words.

234
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,443
I just think he's guilty.

235
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:53,746
I thought it was obvious from the word go.
I mean, nobody proved otherwise.

236
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:57,754
Nobody has to prove otherwise.
The burden of proof's on the prosecution.

237
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:01,485
The defendant doesn't even have to
open his mouth. That's in the Constitution.

238
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:05,620
Oh, well, sure, I know that.
What I meant was, is...

239
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:10,761
Well, I just think he's guilty.
I mean, somebody saw him do it.

240
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:16,000
Okay. Here's what I think,
and I have no personal feelings about this.

241
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:18,440
I just want to talk about facts.

242
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:20,575
Number one.

243
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:26,145
The old man lived downstairs under
the room where the killing took place.

244
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:29,687
At 12:10 on the night of the killing,
he heard loud noises.

245
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:32,052
Said it sounded like a fight.

246
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:35,024
And he heard the kid yell out,
"I'm going to kill you."

247
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,561
A second later,
he heard a body hit the floor.

248
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,925
Ran to the door, opened it up,

249
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:41,932
saw the kid running down the stairs
and out of the house.

250
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:45,697
Called the police. They came in and found
the old man with the knife in his chest.

251
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:49,035
The coroner fixed
the time of death around midnight.

252
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:54,204
Now, these are facts.
You can't refute facts. The kid is guilty.

253
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:58,774
I'm just as sentimental as the next fellow.
I know he's only 18.

254
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:02,149
- But he's still got to pay for what he did.
- JUROR #7: I'm with you.

255
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:04,745
JUROR #1: Okay. Are you finished?

256
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,222
- Yeah.
- Right. Next.

257
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:09,852
It is obvious to me, anyway,
that the boy's entire story was flimsy.

258
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,793
He claimed he was at the movies
during the time of the killing

259
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:13,023
and yet one hour later,

260
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,692
he couldn't remember the names
of the films he saw or who played in them.

261
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:17,496
- JUROR #3: That's right.
- And no one saw him

262
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:18,900
going in or out of the theater.

263
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:20,733
Listen, what about
the woman across the street?

264
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,034
If her testimony
don't prove it, nothing does.

265
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,576
That's right. She was the one
who actually saw the killing.

266
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:27,770
JUROR #1: Now, fellows, please.
Let's go in order here, huh?

267
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,179
Just a minute. Here's a woman...

268
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:34,946
Here's a woman who's lying in bed.
She can't sleep. She's dying with the heat.

269
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,214
You know what I mean?

270
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,949
Anyway she looks out the window,
and right across the street

271
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,323
she sees the kid
stick the knife into his father.

272
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:45,955
The time is 12:10 on the nose.
Everything fits.

273
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,192
Look, she's known the kid all his life.

274
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,530
His window is right opposite hers
across the El tracks,

275
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,035
and she swore she saw him do it.

276
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:54,162
Through the windows of a passing El train.

277
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,969
Right. This El train
had no passengers on it.

278
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,135
It was just being moved downtown.

279
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,372
The lights were out, remember?
And they proved in court that at night

280
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,813
you can look through the windows
of an El train when the lights are out

281
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,977
and see what's happening
on the other side. They proved it.

282
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,987
I'd like to ask you something.

283
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,819
You don't believe the boy's story.
How come you believe the woman's?

284
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,393
She's one of them, too, isn't she?

285
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:18,988
You're a pretty smart fellow, aren't you?

286
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,032
JUROR #1: Okay, gentlemen.
Now, gentlemen.

287
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:25,536
- Come on, sit down. Sit down.
- What's he so wise about? I'm telling you...

288
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:29,095
JUROR #1: Okay, now come on. Now
we're not going to get anywhere fighting.

289
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:32,974
- Whose turn is it next?
- Oh, his. Number five.

290
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:39,143
Can I pass?

291
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,947
JUROR #1: Well, that's your privilege.

292
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,147
How about the next gentleman?

293
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:47,316
Oh. Well, I don't know.

294
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:51,954
I started to be convinced,
you know, very early in the case.

295
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:55,192
You see, I was looking for a motive.

296
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,360
That's very important
because if you don't have a motive,

297
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,903
where's your case, right?

298
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:03,334
Anyway, that testimony from those people

299
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:06,673
in the apartment
across the hall from the kid's apartment,

300
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:08,973
that was very powerful.

301
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:12,050
Didn't they say something
about a fight, an argument,

302
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:16,212
between the old man and his son
around about 7:00 that night?

303
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,050
I mean, I could be wrong but...

304
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,818
- It was 8:00, not 7:00.
- It was 8:00, that's right.

305
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,860
They heard an argument.
They couldn't hear what it was about.

306
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:25,862
Then they heard
the father hit the boy twice.

307
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:29,730
Finally they saw the boy run, angry,
out of the house. What does that prove?

308
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:33,236
It don't exactly prove anything.
It's just part of the picture.

309
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,737
You said it provided a motive.

310
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,330
The prosecuting attorney
said the same thing.

311
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:38,739
I don't think
that was a very strong motive.

312
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:42,302
This boy has been hit so many times
in his life that violence is practically...

313
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:44,974
It's a normal state of affairs with him.

314
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:49,577
I just can't see two slaps in the face
provoking him into committing murder.

315
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:53,454
It may have been two too many.
Everyone has a breaking point.

316
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,555
JUROR #1: Anything else?

317
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:01,797
- No.
- JUROR #1: Okay. How about you?

318
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:06,135
I don't know. It's all been said.

319
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:10,807
You can talk here forever.
It's still the same thing.

320
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,134
This kid is 5 for 0.

321
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:15,943
Well, look at his record.

322
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,346
When he was 10,
he was in children's court.

323
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,145
He threw a rock at a teacher.

324
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:24,018
When he was 15, he was in reform school.
He stole a car.

325
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,124
He's been arrested for mugging.

326
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,160
He was picked up twice for knife fighting.

327
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:34,062
They say he's real handy with a knife.
Oh, this is a very fine boy.

328
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,260
Ever since he was five years old,
his father beat him up regularly.

329
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:38,927
He used his fists.

330
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:41,267
So would I. A kid like that?

331
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:44,501
It's these kids,
the way they are nowadays.

332
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:50,911
When I was a kid,
I used to call my father "Sir".

333
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:54,383
That's right, "Sir". Do you ever hear
a kid call his father that anymore?

334
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:56,977
JUROR #8: Fathers don't seem to think
it's important anymore.

335
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:59,919
- You got any kids?
- Three.

336
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:02,820
I got one.

337
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:06,097
He's 22 years old.

338
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,167
When he was nine years old,
he ran away from a fight.

339
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,638
I saw it.
I was so embarrassed, I almost threw up.

340
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:26,511
I said, "I'm going to make a man out
of you if I have to break you in two trying."

341
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,446
Well, I made a man out of him.

342
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,591
When he was 16, we had a fight.

343
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,929
Hit me in the jaw. He was a big kid.

344
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:43,599
I haven't seen him for two years.

345
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,131
Kids.

346
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,607
You work your heart out...

347
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,874
Well, let's get going.

348
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,914
JUROR #4: I think
we're missing the point here.

349
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:58,414
This boy, let's say he's the product

350
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,451
of a broken home
and a filthy neighborhood.

351
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:01,610
We can't help that.

352
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,120
We're here to decide
whether he's innocent or guilty.

353
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:07,316
Not to go into the reasons
why he grew up the way he did.

354
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:10,054
He was born in a slum.
Slums are breeding grounds for criminals.

355
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,857
I know it and so do you.

356
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:14,056
It's no secret that
children from slum backgrounds

357
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,101
are potential menaces to society.
Now, I think...

358
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:18,965
Brother, you can say that again.

359
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:21,665
The kids who crawl out
of these places are real trash.

360
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:23,172
I don't want any part of them,
I'm telling you.

361
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:24,765
Listen, I...

362
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,139
I've lived in a slum all my life.

363
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:29,008
- JUROR #10: Wait a minute.
- Please. I...

364
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,947
I've played in backyards
that were filled with garbage.

365
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,746
- Maybe you can still smell it on me.
- Now, listen, sonny...

366
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,413
- Come on, now. There's nothing personal.
- No, there was something personal.

367
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:41,014
Come on, fellow. He didn't mean you.
Let's not be so sensitive.

368
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:43,454
This sensitivity I can understand.

369
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:47,999
Okay, look. Let's stop the arguing.
We're only wasting time.

370
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,901
Your turn down there. Let's go.

371
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,596
I didn't expect a turn.
I thought you were all going

372
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,230
to try to convince me.
Wasn't that the idea?

373
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:58,707
- Check, that was the idea.
- I forgot about that. He's right.

374
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,937
What difference does it make?
He's the one who's keeping us in here.

375
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,604
- Let's hear what he's got to say.
- Now, wait a minute.

376
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,979
We decided to do this a certain way.
I think we ought to stick to that way.

377
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:08,211
Oh, stop being a kid, will you?

378
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,550
- What do you mean, "a kid"?
- What do you think I mean?

379
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:12,247
K-l-D, kid.

380
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:18,456
Listen, just because I'm trying
to keep this thing organized?

381
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,622
Here, you take it.
You take on the responsibility.

382
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,723
I'll just keep my mouth shut, that's all.

383
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,927
What are you getting so hot about?
Calm down, will you?

384
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:27,231
Don't tell me to calm down.
Here, you want to take the chair?

385
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:28,363
Just take the chair, that's all.

386
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:30,703
- See if you can keep it running.
- Did you ever see such a thing?

387
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,970
- Listen, you think it's funny or something?
- Hey, forget it, fellow.

388
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,739
The whole thing's unimportant. Come on.

389
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:36,211
Unimportant? Well, here, you try it.

390
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:39,681
No. Nobody wants to change.
You're doing a beautiful job. Sit down.

391
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:44,620
JUROR #7: Yeah, you're doing great. Just
great, fellow. You stay in there and pitch.

392
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:49,024
All right, let's hear from somebody.

393
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:53,086
JUROR #8: Well, if you want me to tell you
how I feel about it, it's all right with me.

394
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:57,892
- Boy, I don't care what you do.
- All right. I don't have anything brilliant.

395
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,768
I only know as much as you do.

396
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:04,501
According to the testimony,
the boy looks guilty. Maybe he is.

397
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:09,342
I sat there in court for six days
listening while the evidence built up.

398
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,279
Everybody sounded so positive.

399
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:15,547
I began to get a peculiar feeling about
this trial. I mean, nothing is that positive.

400
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:18,145
There are a lot of questions
I'd have liked to ask.

401
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:21,020
I don't know, maybe they wouldn't have
meant anything but...

402
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,855
I began to get the feeling
that the defense counsel

403
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:26,624
wasn't conducting a thorough enough
cross-examination. I'm not...

404
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:28,892
He let too many things go by. Little things.

405
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,594
What little things? Listen, when
these fellows don't ask questions,

406
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:34,729
it's because they know the answers
already and they figure they'll be hurt.

407
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,640
Maybe. It's also possible for a lawyer
to be just plain stupid, isn't it?

408
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:39,903
I mean, it's possible.

409
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:42,946
You sound like you met
my brother-in-law once.

410
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:47,447
I kept putting myself in the kid's place.

411
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:51,314
I'd have asked for another lawyer, I think.

412
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:53,948
I mean, if I was on trial for my life,

413
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:58,758
I'd want my lawyer to tear the prosecution
witnesses to shreds, or at least try to.

414
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:03,301
Look, there was one alleged eyewitness
to this killing.

415
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:07,098
Someone else claims he heard the killing,
saw the boy run out afterwards,

416
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:09,070
and there was
a lot of circumstantial evidence.

417
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:12,837
But actually those two witnesses
were the entire case for the prosecution.

418
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:14,571
Supposing they're wrong?

419
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,476
What do you mean,
"Supposing they're wrong?"

420
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:18,208
What's the point
of having witnesses at all?

421
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:20,181
Could they be wrong?

422
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,583
What are you trying to say?
Those people sat on the stand under oath.

423
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,382
They're only people.
People make mistakes.

424
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:26,150
Could they be wrong?

425
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:29,791
- Well, no. I don't think so.
- Do you know so?

426
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:31,760
Oh, come on,
nobody can know a thing like that.

427
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,421
This isn't an exact science.

428
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,000
That's right, it isn't.

429
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:42,699
Okay, let's get to the point.

430
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:45,640
What about the switch knife
they found in the old man's chest?

431
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:47,678
Wait a minute, there's some people
who haven't talked yet.

432
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:48,837
Shouldn't we go in order?

433
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:52,383
They'll get a chance to talk.
Be quiet a second, will you?

434
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:53,781
Well, what about it?

435
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:57,548
The knife this fine, upright boy
admitted buying the night of the killing?

436
00:25:57,656 --> 00:26:00,022
- Let's talk about it.
- All right. Let's talk about it.

437
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:01,149
Let's get it in here and look at it.

438
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:04,717
- I'd like to see it again. Mr. Foreman?
- JUROR #3: We all saw what it looks like.

439
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:06,228
Why do we have to see it again?

440
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:09,494
JUROR #4: The gentleman has a right
to see exhibits and evidence.

441
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:12,231
- Say, could you bring us the knife?
- The knife?

442
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:13,770
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Sure.

443
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:18,704
The knife and the way it was bought
is pretty strong evidence, don't you think?

444
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,471
- I do.
- Good.

445
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:23,013
Now suppose we take
these facts one at a time.

446
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:25,173
One, the boy admitted going
out of the house at 8:00

447
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:26,307
on the night of the murder

448
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,443
after being slapped
several times by his father.

449
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:31,113
No, no, no, he didn't say "slapped."
He said "punched."

450
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:33,690
There's a difference
between a slap and a punch.

451
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:36,386
After being hit several times by his father.

452
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:40,328
Two, he went directly to a neighborhood
junk shop where he bought one of those...

453
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,525
- Switch knives.
- Switchblade knives.

454
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:44,831
This wasn't what
you'd call an ordinary knife.

455
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,700
It had a very unusual
carved handle and blade.

456
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:50,434
The storekeeper who sold it to him
said it was the only one of its kind

457
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:52,339
he had ever had in stock.

458
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:56,346
Three, he met some friends of his
in front of a tavern about 8:45.

459
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,710
Am I right so far?

460
00:26:57,816 --> 00:26:59,943
- Yes, you are.
- You bet he is.

461
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:03,214
He talked with his friends
for about an hour, leaving them at 9:45.

462
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:06,313
During this time,
they saw the switch knife.

463
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:12,556
Four, they identified the death weapon
in court as that very same knife.

464
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:15,992
Five, he arrived home at about 10:00.

465
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:17,728
Now, this is where the stories offered by

466
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:20,532
the State and the boy
begin to diverge slightly.

467
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,233
He claims that he went
to a movie at about 11:30,

468
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:27,277
returning home at 3:10 to find
his father dead and himself arrested.

469
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:29,609
JUROR #8: He also claims that
the two detectives who arrested him

470
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:31,773
threw him down a half a flight of stairs.

471
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:33,680
Now, what happened to the switch knife?

472
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:36,447
He claims that it fell through a hole
in his pocket on the way to the movie,

473
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:39,546
sometime between 11:30 and 3:10,

474
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:43,253
and that he never saw it again.
Now, there is a tale, gentlemen.

475
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:46,797
I think it's quite clear that the boy
never went to the movies that night.

476
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:48,798
No one in the house
saw him go out at 11:30.

477
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,299
No one at the theater identified him.

478
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:53,235
He couldn't even remember
the names of the pictures he saw.

479
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,303
JUROR #4: What actually happened is this.

480
00:27:57,409 --> 00:28:00,742
The boy stayed home,
had another fight with his father,

481
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:04,440
stabbed him to death
and left the house at 12:10.

482
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:07,313
He even remembered to
wipe the knife clean of fingerprints.

483
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:11,321
Now are you trying to tell me
that this knife really fell through a hole

484
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:13,357
in the boy's pocket,
someone picked it up off the street,

485
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:14,447
went to the boy's house

486
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,119
and stabbed his father with it
just to test its sharpness?

487
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:19,389
No, I'm just saying
it's possible the boy lost his knife

488
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:21,761
and that somebody else
stabbed his father with a similar knife.

489
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:25,063
- It's just possible.
- Take a look at this knife.

490
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:28,697
It's a very unusual knife.

491
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:30,399
I've never seen one like it.

492
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:33,238
Neither had the storekeeper
who sold it to the boy.

493
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:36,177
Aren't you asking us to accept
a pretty incredible coincidence?

494
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:40,741
- I'm just saying a coincidence is possible.
- And I say it's not possible.

495
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,290
JUROR #7: Where did that come from?

496
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,726
- It's the same knife!
- What do you think you're doing?

497
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,354
Where did you get it?

498
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:55,626
I went out walking
for a couple of hours last night.

499
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,759
I walked through the boy's neighborhood.

500
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:01,134
I bought that at a little pawn shop
just two blocks from the boy's house.

501
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,139
It cost $6.

502
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,903
It's against the law
to buy or sell switchblade knives.

503
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:09,639
- That's right. I broke the law.
- Listen, you pulled a real bright trick.

504
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,012
Now supposing you tell me what it proves.

505
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:14,142
Maybe there are 10 knives like that.
So what?

506
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:17,050
- Maybe there are!
- What does it mean?

507
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:18,816
You found another knife like it.
What's that?

508
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,515
The discovery of the age or something?

509
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:23,059
You mean you're asking us to believe
that somebody else did the stabbing

510
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:24,594
with exactly the same kind of knife?

511
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:27,426
- The odds are a million-to-one.
- It's possible!

512
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:29,796
But not very probable.

513
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:31,801
JUROR #1: Okay, fellows.
Let's take our seats.

514
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:34,633
There's no point
standing around all over the place.

515
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,538
You know,
it's interesting that he'd find a knife

516
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:39,200
exactly like the one the boy bought.

517
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:42,006
What's interesting about it? Interesting!

518
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,910
Well, I don't know,
I just thought it was interesting.

519
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:46,279
There are still 11 of us here
who think he's guilty.

520
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:48,147
JUROR #10: Right. What do you think
you're going to accomplish?

521
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:50,050
You're not going
to change anybody's mind.

522
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:52,680
So if you want to be stubborn
and hang this jury, go ahead.

523
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,487
The kid will be tried again
and found guilty, sure as he's born.

524
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,327
You're probably right.

525
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,160
So, what are you going to do?
We could be here all night.

526
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,494
JUROR #9: It's only one night.
A boy may die.

527
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,438
Well, why don't we just set up house here?

528
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,031
Someone send for Potsy the policeman
to get a pinochle deck

529
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:14,134
and we'll just sweat
the whole thing out right here.

530
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:18,038
- I don't think he ought to joke about it.
- What do you want me to do about it?

531
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,776
Listen, I don't see what all this stuff

532
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:21,909
about the knife
has got to do with anything.

533
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,989
Somebody saw the kid stab his father.
What more do we need?

534
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:27,785
You guys can talk the ears
right off my head, you know what I mean?

535
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:30,622
I got three garages of mine
going to pot while you're talking.

536
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:32,320
So let's get done and get out of here.

537
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:35,661
The knife was very important to the
district attorney. He spent a whole day...

538
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:38,395
He's a 15th assistant or something.
What does he know about it?

539
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,800
JUROR #1: Hey, let's hold it down.

540
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:42,668
These side arguments
are only slowing us up.

541
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:48,506
- Well, what about it?
- JUROR #3: You're the only one.

542
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:59,250
I have a proposition to make to all of you.

543
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:02,190
I'm going to call for another vote.

544
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:07,697
I want you 11 men
to vote by secret written ballot.

545
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:12,666
I'll abstain. If there are 11 votes for guilty,
I won't stand alone.

546
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:17,070
We'll take in a guilty verdict
to the judge right now.

547
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:22,902
But if anyone votes not guilty,
we stay here and talk it out.

548
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:29,720
- That's it. If you want to try it, I'm ready.
- All right. Let's do it the hard way.

549
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:32,813
That sounds fair. Everyone agreed?
Anyone doesn't agree?

550
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:34,892
Fine, let's go. Pass these along.

551
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:10,694
"Guilty."

552
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,097
"Guilty."

553
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:17,661
"Guilty."

554
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,197
"Guilty."

555
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,967
"Guilty."

556
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:26,970
"Guilty."

557
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:30,241
"Guilty."

558
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:32,281
"Guilty."

559
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:34,885
"Guilty."

560
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,890
"Not guilty."

561
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:42,516
"Guilty."

562
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:46,859
- Boy, how do you like that?
- And another chap flips his wings!

563
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,934
All right. Who was it?
Come on, I want to know.

564
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:53,800
Excuse me. This was a secret ballot.
We all agreed on that, no?

565
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:56,100
If the gentleman
wants it to remain secret...

566
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:57,970
Secret? What do you mean, "secret"?

567
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:00,840
There are no secrets in a jury room.
I know who it was.

568
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,909
Brother, you really are something.

569
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:06,176
You sit here, vote guilty like the rest of us,

570
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:09,617
then some golden-voiced preacher
starts tearing your poor heart out

571
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:12,918
about some underprivileged kid
just couldn't help becoming a murderer

572
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:16,687
and you change your vote.
If that isn't the most sickening...

573
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:19,695
Why don't you drop a quarter
in his collection box?

574
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:24,199
Oh, now just wait a...
Listen, you can't talk to me like that.

575
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:25,326
Who do you think you are?

576
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:27,996
- Calm down, calm down. It doesn't matter.
- Who does he think he is?

577
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:31,439
- He's very excitable. Sit down.
- "Excitable"? You bet I'm excitable!

578
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:34,739
We're trying to put a guilty man
in the chair, where he belongs.

579
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,679
Someone starts telling us fairytales
and we're listening!

580
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:39,511
JUROR #1: Hey, come on.

581
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:44,316
- What made you change your vote?
- He didn't change his vote. I did.

582
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:46,549
JUROR #10: Oh, fine.
JUROR #7: I knew it.

583
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:50,559
- Would you like me to tell you why?
- No, I wouldn't like you to tell me why.

584
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:53,186
Well, I'd like to make it clear anyway,
if you don't mind.

585
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:54,730
Do we have to listen to this?

586
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:58,165
- The man wants to talk.
- Thank you.

587
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:01,670
This gentleman has been
standing alone against us.

588
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:04,037
Now he doesn't say the boy is not guilty.

589
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:08,909
He just isn't sure. It's not easy to stand
alone against the ridicule of others.

590
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:13,950
So he gambled for support,
and I gave it to him. I respect his motives.

591
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:18,546
The boy on trial is probably guilty,
but I want to hear more.

592
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:20,419
Right now, the vote is 10-2.

593
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,652
I'm talking here!
You have no right to leave this room!

594
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,025
He can't hear you. He never will.
Let's sit down.

595
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:35,028
- Shall we continue?
- Well, I think we ought to take a break.

596
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:39,633
You know, one man's inside
and I think we ought to wait for him.

597
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,840
Looks like we're really hung up here, huh?

598
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:49,953
I mean, that thing with the old man,
that was pretty unexpected.

599
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:53,421
Wish I could figure out some way
we could break it up.

600
00:34:55,593 --> 00:35:00,053
You know, in advertising...
I told you I worked in an agency?

601
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:02,132
You know, there's some
pretty strange people working there.

602
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,097
Well, they're not strange, really.

603
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:06,864
I guess it's just they have peculiar ways
of expressing themselves.

604
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:08,131
You know what I mean.

605
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:11,367
Well, of course, I suppose it's the same
in your business too, huh?

606
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:14,070
- What do you do?
- I'm a watchmaker.

607
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:18,274
Really? I imagine the finest watchmakers
in the world come from Europe.

608
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:19,474
Well, anyway, as I was telling you,

609
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:21,552
in an agency,
when we reach a point like this...

610
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:24,815
I'm telling him about in an ad agency when
a point like this is reached in a meeting,

611
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:28,289
there's always some character
ready with an idea, see.

612
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:30,917
And it kills me.
It's the weirdest thing in the world

613
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:35,021
the way they sometimes precede
their idea with a phrase, see, like,

614
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:38,000
some account exec
will get up and he'll say,

615
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:44,337
"Okay, here's an idea. Let's run it up
the flagpole and see if anyone salutes it."

616
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,876
I mean, it's idiotic, but it's funny.

617
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:50,505
Hey, I got a little excited back there.

618
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:54,244
I didn't mean to get nasty.

619
00:35:55,153 --> 00:36:00,216
Glad you're not one of those who lets
these emotional appeals influence him.

620
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:19,169
I don't know what's the matter
with that fan. Can't seem to get it started.

621
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,741
(SCATTING)

622
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:31,412
- Are you a salesman?
- I'm an architect.

623
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:36,721
You know what the soft sell is?

624
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:41,462
Well, you've got it, believe me.

625
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:44,965
I've got a different technique.

626
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:49,096
Laughs, drinks, jokes, tricks. You know?

627
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,009
Yeah.

628
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:55,742
"Hit them where they live,"
that's my motto.

629
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:59,848
I made 27 grand last year
selling marmalade.

630
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:03,284
That's not bad.
I mean, you know, considering marmalade.

631
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:08,120
What are you getting out of this? Kicks?

632
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:13,128
Or did somebody bump you on the head
one time and you haven't gotten over it?

633
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:17,327
- Maybe.
- You know, you do-gooders are all alike.

634
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:21,298
You're always blowing your stacks
over some guy that fanned.

635
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:26,035
But what are you wasting our time for?

636
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:30,477
Why don't you donate $5 to the cause
and maybe it'll make you feel better.

637
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:35,643
This kid is guilty, pal.

638
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:38,317
It's as plain as the nose on your face.

639
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,583
So why don't
we stop wasting our time here?

640
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:43,455
We're going to all get sore throats
if we keep it up.

641
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:46,894
What difference does it make
if you get it here or at the ball game?

642
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,228
No difference, pal.

643
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,069
No difference at all.

644
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:55,069
(WHISTLING)

645
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:08,749
- Nice bunch of guys, huh?
- They're about the same as anyone else.

646
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:11,321
Boy, what a murderous day.

647
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:15,082
- Do you think we'll be much longer?
- I don't know.

648
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:20,359
He's guilty for sure.
Not a doubt in the whole world.

649
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:23,194
We should've been done already.

650
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:26,468
Oh, I don't mind, you know.

651
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,538
Beats working.

652
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:32,603
(MUTTERS)

653
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:39,415
- You think he's not guilty, huh?
- I don't know. It's possible.

654
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:43,545
Well, I don't know you, but I'm betting
you've never been wronger in your life.

655
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:46,214
You're wasting your time.
You ought to wrap it up.

656
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,122
Supposing you were the one
that was on trial?

657
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:52,218
Well, I'm not used to supposing.
I'm just a working man.

658
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,458
My boss does the supposing.

659
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:57,500
But I'll try one.

660
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:01,667
Supposing you talk us all out of this

661
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:05,469
and the kid really did knife his father, huh?

662
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:15,018
Are you ready?

663
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,417
Sorry, blue eyes.

664
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,314
Well, where else?

665
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:22,392
JUROR #1: Okay, fellows.
Let's take our seats.

666
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:26,930
- Looks like we'll be here for dinner, huh?
- Okay, now let's get down to business.

667
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,056
- Now who wants to start it off?
- I will.

668
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:32,067
- Okay, go.
- You, down there.

669
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:33,932
The old man who lived downstairs says

670
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,972
he heard the kid yell out,
"I'm going to kill you."

671
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:38,701
A second later,
he heard the body hit the floor.

672
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:42,108
Now he ran to the door and he saw
the kid running down the stairs

673
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,272
and out of the house.
What does that mean to you?

674
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,974
I was wondering how clearly the old man

675
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:47,880
could have heard
the boy's voice through the ceiling.

676
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:49,680
He didn't hear it through the ceiling.
The window was open.

677
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:51,880
So was the one upstairs.
It was a hot night, remember?

678
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:54,549
It was another apartment.
It's not that easy to identify a voice,

679
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:55,750
particularly a shouting voice.

680
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,293
JUROR #12: He identified it in court.

681
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,124
JUROR #3: That's right, and don't forget
the lady across the street,

682
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,994
she looked right in the open window
and saw the boy stab his father.

683
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,533
- Isn't that enough for you?
- No, it isn't.

684
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:08,332
Boy, how do you like this guy?
It's like talking into a dead phone.

685
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:09,736
JUROR #4: She said she saw the killing

686
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,705
through the windows
of a moving elevated train.

687
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:15,267
There were six cars on the train. She saw
the killing through the last two cars.

688
00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:16,778
She remembered
the most insignificant details.

689
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:19,213
I don't see how you can argue with that.

690
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:24,379
Has anybody here any idea
how long it would take an el...

691
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:36,428
This isn't a game.

692
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:42,336
Did you see him?

693
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,534
- The nerve! The absolute nerve!
- JUROR #1: All right. Listen to me.

694
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:49,340
- All right. Forget it. It's not important.
- "This isn't a game"?

695
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,883
- Who does he think he is?
- Forget it now.

696
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:57,249
Has anybody any idea how long it takes
an elevated train going at medium speed

697
00:40:57,354 --> 00:40:58,582
to pass a given point?

698
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:00,486
- What has that to do with anything?
- How long? Take a guess.

699
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:02,957
- I wouldn't have the slightest idea.
- What do you think?

700
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:06,791
- I don't know, maybe 10, 12 seconds?
- I think that's a pretty good guess.

701
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:08,558
- JUROR #11: Anyone else?
- That sounds right to me.

702
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,463
JUROR #10: Come on.
What's the guessing game for?

703
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:12,331
- What do you say?
- Ten seconds is about right.

704
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:14,461
All right. Say 10 seconds.
What are you getting at?

705
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:19,600
This. It takes a six-car El train
10 seconds to pass a given point.

706
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,304
Now, let's say the given point
is the open window of the room

707
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:24,005
where the killing took place.

708
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:27,311
You can reach out of that window
and almost touch the El tracks, right?

709
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:31,115
Now let me ask you this. Has anyone
here ever lived near the El tracks?

710
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:34,919
Well, I just finished painting an apartment
that overlooked an El line.

711
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:36,287
I was there for three days.

712
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:38,452
- What was it like? Noisy?
- What do you mean? Oh, brother!

713
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:40,388
No matter, though. We were punchy.

714
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,126
I lived in a second floor apartment
near the El line once.

715
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:46,203
When the window's open and the train
goes by, the noise is almost unbearable.

716
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:47,668
You can hardly hear yourself think.

717
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:49,170
JUROR #3: All right, you can't
hear yourself think.

718
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,833
- Will you get to the point?
- I will, now just a minute.

719
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:55,537
Let's take two pieces of testimony
and try to put them together.

720
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:59,810
First, the old man
in the apartment downstairs.

721
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:02,249
He says he heard the boy say,
"I'm going to kill you,"

722
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,083
and a split-second later
heard a body hit the floor.

723
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,781
- One second later, right?
- JUROR #2: That's right.

724
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:10,884
Second, the woman
across the street swore positively

725
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:13,896
she looked out of the window
and saw the killing

726
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:16,489
through the last two cars
of a passing elevated train, right?

727
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,567
The last two cars.

728
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:18,692
JUROR #3: Well, what are
you giving us here?

729
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:20,133
Now, just a minute.

730
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:25,504
We've agreed that it takes 10 seconds
for a train to pass a given point.

731
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:28,840
Since the woman saw the killing
through the last two cars,

732
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:34,213
we can assume that the body hit
the floor just as the train went by.

733
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:38,379
Therefore, the train had been
roaring by the old man's window

734
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:42,016
a full 10 seconds
before the body hit the floor.

735
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:44,287
The old man,
according to his own testimony,

736
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,364
"I'm going to kill you,"
body hitting the floor a split-second later,

737
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:49,955
would have had to hear
the boy make this statement

738
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,932
with the El roaring past his nose!

739
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:53,298
It's not possible he could have heard it.

740
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:54,632
That's idiotic, of course he heard it.

741
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:55,762
You think he could have heard it?

742
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:57,033
He said he yelled at the top of his voice,

743
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:59,132
- that's good enough for me...
- Even if he heard something,

744
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,404
he still couldn't have identified
the voice with the El roaring by.

745
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:04,606
You're talking about a matter of seconds!
Nobody can be that accurate.

746
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:07,343
Well, I think testimony
that could put a boy into the electric chair

747
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:09,419
should be that accurate.

(MAN MUTTERING)

749
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:13,021
Can I tell you something?
I don't think he could have heard it.

750
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:15,455
Maybe he didn't hear it.
I mean, with all that El noise.

JUROR #3: What are you people
talking about?

752
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:19,353
JUROR #5: Well, it stands to reason
he couldn't have heard it.

753
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:23,859
- Why should he lie? What's he got to gain?
- Attention, maybe.

You keep coming in
with these bright sayings.

Why don't you send them in to a paper?
They pay $3 apiece!

What are you talking to him like that for?

757
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:35,612
A guy talks like that to an old man
really ought to get stepped on, you know.

758
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:38,648
You ought to have more respect, mister.

759

You say stuff like that to him again,
I'm going to lay you out.

Now you go ahead.
You say anything you like.

Why do you think the old man might lie?

762

It was just that
I looked at him for a very long time.

763
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:07,673
The seam of his jacket was split,
under the shoulder.

I mean, to come to court like that.

(JUROR #10 COUGHING)

766
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:18,218
He was a very old man in a torn jacket,

767
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:22,092
and he walked very slowly to the stand.

768
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:26,388
He was dragging his left leg
and trying to hide it

769
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,397
because he was ashamed.

I think I know this man
better than anyone here.

Who has never had recognition
or his name in the newspapers.

Nobody knows him. Nobody quotes him.

Nobody seeks his advice after 75 years.

Gentlemen, that's a very sad thing,
to mean nothing.

778
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:05,399
A man like this needs to be quoted,
to be listened to.

779
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:09,939
To be quoted just once,
very important to him.

780
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,941

just so he could be important once?

783

No. He wouldn't really lie.

784
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:23,043
But perhaps he made himself
believe he heard those words

785
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:25,553
and recognized the boy's face.

I've ever heard.

There's something else I'd like
to talk about for a minute. Thanks.

I think we've proved that

the boy say,
"I'm going to kill you." But supposing...

You didn't prove it at all!
What are you talking about?

795
00:45:58,122 --> 00:46:00,488
Wait. Supposing he really did hear it?

796

This phrase, how many times
have all of us used it? Probably thousands.

and I'm going to kill you."

"Get in there, Rocky, and kill him."
We say it everyday.

800

That doesn't mean
we're really gonna kill anybody.

Wait a minute.
What are you trying to give us here?

The phrase was, "I'm going to kill you."

The kid yelled it at the top of his lungs.

804
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:18,508
Don't tell me he didn't mean it.

805
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,009

the way he said it, they mean it!

Well, gee, now I don't know.

807

I remember I was arguing with the guy

808
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:27,306
I work next to at the bank
a couple of weeks ago.

809
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:29,180
He called me an idiot, so I yelled at him.

810
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:32,187
Now listen, this guy is trying
to make you believe things that aren't so!

811
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,689
The kid said he was going to kill him
and he did kill him.

812

Let me ask you this, do you really think

813
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:37,420
the boy would shout it out a thing like that

814
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:39,428
so the whole neighborhood
could hear him?

815
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:41,464
I don't think so.
He's much too bright for that.

816
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:44,159
Bright? He's a common, ignorant slob.

817
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:46,429
He don't even speak good English.

818
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:49,768
He doesn't even speak good English.

change my vote to not guilty.

- You heard me.

821
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:01,743
- JUROR #1: Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

822
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:04,286
The vote is 9-3 in favor of guilty.

823
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:06,856
Well, if this isn't the living end!

824
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:14,553
What are you basing it on?
Stories this guy made up?

825
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,656
You ought to write for
one of those kooky detective magazines,

826
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:18,894
you'd make a fortune.

827
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:22,494
For crying out loud, the kid's own lawyer
knew he didn't stand a chance.

828
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:26,133
Right from the beginning,
his own lawyer knew, and you could see it.

829
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:30,077
Boy, oh, boy, I'm telling you.
This guy here is really something.

830
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:33,844
Look, the kid had a lawyer, didn't he?
He presented his case, not you.

831
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:35,384
How come you got so much to say?

832
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:36,975
JUROR #5: Look, lawyers aren't infallible,
you know.

833
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:39,647
- Baltimore, please.
- He was court-appointed.

834
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:42,281
- Now what's that supposed to mean?
- Well, it could mean a lot of things.

835
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:45,793
It could mean he didn't want the case
or he resented being appointed.

836
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:46,954
It's the kind of case
that brings you nothing,

837
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:50,397
no money, no glory,
not even much chance of winning.

838
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:53,526
That's not a very promising
situation for a young lawyer.

839
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:56,401
He'd really have to believe in his client
to put up any kind of a good case

840
00:47:56,506 --> 00:47:58,440
and as you pointed out
a minute ago, obviously he didn't.

841
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,510
Of course he didn't.

842
00:48:01,578 --> 00:48:03,739
Who the heck could?

843
00:48:03,847 --> 00:48:06,680
Except maybe some guy's mother
or somebody, I...

844
00:48:06,783 --> 00:48:10,150
Oh, look. Will you look at the time?
Come on, for crying...

845
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:17,023
Pardon me. I have made some notes here,
and I would like, please, to say something.

846
00:48:17,127 --> 00:48:20,062
I have been listening very carefully and

847
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:23,724
it seems to me that this man
has some very good points to make.

848
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:28,294
From what was presented at the trial,
the boy looks guilty, on the surface.

849
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:32,603
- But maybe if we go deeper...
- Come on, will you?

850
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:35,041
There is a question I would like to ask.

851
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:38,376
Let us assume that the boy
really did commit the murder.

852
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:41,815
Now, this happened at 12:10.

853
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:44,251
Now, how was he caught by the police?

854
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:48,984
He came back home at 3:00 or so,

855
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:52,721
and he was captured by two detectives
in the hallway of his house.

856
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:57,459
Now, my question is,
if he really had killed his father,

857
00:48:57,567 --> 00:49:00,764
why would he come back home
three hours later?

858
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:03,840
Wouldn't he be afraid of being caught?

859
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,465
He came home to get his knife.

860
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:08,066
It's not nice to go around leaving knives
sticking in people's chests.

861
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:10,976
Yeah, especially relatives'.

862
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:13,242
JUROR #4: I don't see anything funny
about it.

863
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:17,012
The boy knew the knife could be
identified as the one he had just bought.

864
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,179
He had to get it before the police did.

865
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,416
JUROR #11: But if he knew
the knife could be identified,

866
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:24,187
why did he leave it there in the first place?

867
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:27,127
Well, I think we can assume
the boy ran out in a state of panic

868
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:29,755
after having just killed his father.

869
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:32,858
When he finally calmed down,
he realized he'd left his knife there.

870
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,939
This, then, depends on
your definition of "panic."

871
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:39,133
He would have had to be calm enough
to see to it that there were no fingerprints

872
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:40,903
left on the knife.

873
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:44,469
Now, where did this panic start
and where did it end?

874
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:47,812
Look, you voted guilty.
What side are you on?

875
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:51,081
I don't believe I have to be loyal
to one side or the other.

876
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:53,019
I'm simply asking questions.

877
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:56,388
Well, this is just off the top of my head,

878
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,552
but if I were the boy
and I'd done the stabbing and everything

879
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,789
I'd take a chance and go back for the knife.

880
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:03,331
I'll bet he figured that
nobody had seen him running out

881
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:06,129
and that the body
wouldn't be discovered till the next day.

882
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:07,999
After all, it was the middle of the night.

883
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:10,471
I'll bet he figured nobody would
find the body till the next day.

884
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:12,701
Pardon. This is my whole point.

885
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:16,506
The woman across the street testified
that the moment after she saw the killing,

886
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:19,047
that is, a moment after the train went by,

887
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:22,243
she screamed,
and then went to telephone the police.

888
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:25,844
Now, the boy certainly
must have heard the scream,

889
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:28,447
so he knew that
somebody saw something.

890
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,960
I just don't think
that he would have gone back.

891
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:35,190
Two things. One, in his state of panic,
he may not have heard the scream.

892
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:36,890
Perhaps it wasn't very loud.

893
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,299
Two, if he did hear it, he may not
have connected it with his own acts.

894
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:43,305
Remember, he lived in a neighborhood
where screams were fairly commonplace.

895
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:47,935
- There's your answer.
- Maybe. Maybe the boy did kill his father.

896
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:50,377
Didn't hear the scream,
did run out in a panic,

897
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,280
did calm down three hours later
and come back to get the knife,

898
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:55,373
risking being caught by the police.

899
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:58,545
Maybe all of those things happened,
but maybe they didn't.

900
00:50:58,655 --> 00:51:00,350
I think there's enough doubt
that we can wonder

901
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:02,789
whether he was there at all
during the time the killing took place.

902
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,520
What do you mean, "doubt"?
What are you talking about?

903
00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:06,425
Didn't the old man see him
running out of the house?

904
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:08,430
He's twisting the facts. I'm telling you.

905
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:11,865
Did or didn't the old man see the kid
running out of the house at 12:10?

906
00:51:11,968 --> 00:51:14,903
- Well, did or didn't he?
- He says he did.

907
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:17,439
Says he did? Boy, how do you like that?

908
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:20,510
- Look, witnesses can make mistakes.
- Sure, when you want them to they do.

909
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:22,373
Or when he wants them to they do!
You know what I mean?

910
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:24,379
- Keep the yelling down.
- Oh, you keep saying that.

911
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:26,142
Maybe what we need
is a little yelling in here.

912
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:28,046
These guys keep
going off every which way.

913
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:30,051
Did hear the scream,
didn't hear the scream,

914
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:31,643
what difference does it make?

915
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,586
You people are talking
only about the little details.

916
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:35,749
You're forgetting the important stuff.
I mean, all of a sudden...

917
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:38,259
- I'm gonna call for another vote.
- I'm talking here!

918
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:40,556
Another vote called for.

919
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:42,962
Now let's take our seats.

920
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:48,529
I never saw
so much time spent on nothing.

921
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:51,505
It only takes a second.

922
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:54,907
JUROR #1: Okay, I guess the fastest way is
to find out who's voting not guilty.

923
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:58,947
All those voting not guilty,
please raise your hands.

924
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:02,610
Still the same. One, two, three not guilty.
Nine guilty.

925
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:03,686
JUROR #7: So now where are we?

926
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,846
I'll tell you,
we can yakety-yak here till next Tuesday.

927
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,753
Where's it all getting us?

928
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:10,759
Pardon. I vote not guilty.

929
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:12,556
(JURORS EX CLAIMING)

930
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:13,763
What are you talking about? I mean,
we're all going crazy in here or something.

931
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:17,062
What are you talking about? I mean,
we're all going crazy in here or something.

932
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:21,069
The kid is guilty.
Why don't you listen to the facts?

933
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:23,537
Tell him, will you?
This is getting to be a joke.

934
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,803
JUROR #1: The vote is 8-4 in favor of guilty.

935
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:29,174
Hey, what is this?
"Love Your Underprivileged Brother" week

936
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:30,678
or something?

937
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,941
I want you to get up
and tell me why you changed your vote.

938
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:34,482
Come on, now, give me reasons.

939
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:39,112
I don't have to defend my decision to you.
There is a reasonable doubt in my mind.

940
00:52:39,222 --> 00:52:40,985
What reasonable doubt?
That's nothing but words.

941
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:42,353
Here, look at this.

942
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:47,362
The kid you just decided isn't guilty
was seen ramming this into his father!

943
00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:49,364
Now what about this,
Mr. Reasonable Doubt?

944
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:52,196
That's not the knife, don't you remember?

945
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:56,762
- Oh, brilliant!
- I'm telling you, this is the craziest.

946
00:52:56,873 --> 00:52:58,898
I mean, what are we supposed to believe?

947
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,705
You're sitting here, you're pulling stories
out of thin air, you know?

948
00:53:02,078 --> 00:53:05,878
A guy like this, if he's sitting ringside
at the Dempsey-Firpo fight,

949
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:08,314
he'd be trying to tell you that...

950
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:10,750
Look. Now what about the old man?

951
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:13,220
Are we supposed to believe
that he didn't get up and run to his door

952
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:16,349
and see the kid tearing down the steps
15 seconds after the killing?

953
00:53:16,459 --> 00:53:19,257
He's just saying so to be important, right?

954
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:21,023
- What's the point of the whole thing?
- Hold on a second.

955
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:23,759
And the Baltimore rooter
is heard from again, now.

956
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,732
And pop-ups are falling for base hits
wherever we look.

957
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:27,462
Hey, hold on a second. Now, look.

958
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:30,938
- Did the old man say he ran to the door?
- Ran, walked, what's the difference?

959
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,168
- He got there, didn't he?
- No, well, wait a second...

960
00:53:33,276 --> 00:53:35,403
He said he ran. At least, I think he did.

961
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:36,774
Look, I don't remember what he said,

962
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,404
but I don't see
how he could have run to the door.

963
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:42,144
He said he went from his bedroom
to the front door. Now, isn't that enough?

964
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:43,913
- Where was the bedroom?
- It was down the hall somewhere.

965
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,386
I thought you remembered everything.
Don't you remember that?

966
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:50,050
No. Mr. Foreman,
I'd like to see a diagram of the apartment.

967
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,219
JUROR #7: Look, why don't we have him
run the trial all over again, so...

968
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:53,489
- Mr. Foreman!
- How come you're the only one

969
00:53:53,597 --> 00:53:55,724
in this room who wants to see exhibits
all the time?

970
00:53:55,832 --> 00:53:58,426
- JUROR #5: I want to see this one, too.
- And I'd like to stop wasting time.

971
00:53:58,535 --> 00:54:00,332
JUROR #4: If we're going to start
wading through all that nonsense

972
00:54:00,437 --> 00:54:01,631
about where the body was found.

973
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:03,171
JUROR #8: We're not.
Not unless somebody else wants to.

974
00:54:03,273 --> 00:54:06,765
But I'd like to find out if an old man
who drags one foot when he walks

975
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:07,865
because he had a stroke last year

976
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:10,276
can get from his bedroom
to his front door in 15 seconds.

977
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:11,711
- He said 20 seconds.
- He said 15.

978
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:14,283
He said 20 seconds.
What are you trying to distort?

979
00:54:14,384 --> 00:54:15,851
JUROR #11: He said 15.

980
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:17,977
How does he know
how long 15 seconds is?

981
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,214
You can't judge a thing like that.

982
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:21,722
JUROR #9: He said 15 seconds.
He was very positive about it.

983
00:54:21,825 --> 00:54:24,123
He was an old man!
Half the time he was confused!

984
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:27,128
How could he be positive about anything?

985
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:35,861
I don't see
what you're going to prove here.

986
00:54:35,972 --> 00:54:38,406
The man said he saw the boy running out.

987
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:42,137
Well, let's see if the details bear him out.
As soon as the body hit the floor,

988
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:45,237
he said he heard footsteps upstairs,
running toward the front door.

989
00:54:45,348 --> 00:54:48,613
Heard the upstairs door open,
the footsteps start down the stairs.

990
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:50,379
He said he got to his own front door
as fast as he could

991
00:54:50,487 --> 00:54:53,081
and he swore it couldn't have been
more than 15 seconds.

992
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:54,713
Now if the killer
began running immediately...

993
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:56,883
- JUROR #12: Maybe he didn't.
- The old man said he did.

994
00:54:56,993 --> 00:54:59,791
JUROR #7: You ought to be at Atlantic City
at that hair-splitters' convention.

995
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:03,354
Hey, why don't you stop making
smart remarks all the time, huh?

996
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,730
My friend, for your $3 a day,
you have to listen to everything.

997
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:07,928
JUROR #10: Now that you got that thing
in here, what about it?

998
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:09,869
All right, here's the apartment
where the killing took place.

999
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:13,568
The old man's apartment was
directly beneath and exactly the same.

1000
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:16,976
Here are the El tracks, the bedroom,
living room, kitchen, bathroom,

1001
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,014
here's the hall, here are the stairs.

1002
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:21,345
Now, the old man was
in this bedroom right here.

1003
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:24,011
He says he crossed to the door,
walked down the hall,

1004
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,644
opened the front door just in time

1005
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:28,280
to see the boy running down the stairs.
Am I right so far?

1006
00:55:28,391 --> 00:55:30,552
JUROR #3: That's the story,
for the 19th time.

1007
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:34,221
- 15 seconds after the body hit the floor.
- JUROR #11: Correct.

1008
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:36,356
Now, let's see. It was...

1009
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:40,402
It's 12 feet from the bed to the door.
The hall is 43 feet.

1010
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:43,700
He would have had to walk 12 feet,
open the bedroom door,

1011
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:47,208
walk 43 feet down
and open the front door, all in 15 seconds.

1012
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:49,801
- You think he could have done it?
- JUROR #10: Sure he could have done it.

1013
00:55:49,913 --> 00:55:51,244
JUROR #11: He can walk only very slowly.

1014
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:52,645
They had to help him
into the witness chair.

1015
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:54,512
JUROR #3: You make it sound
like a long walk.

1016
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:57,814
JUROR #9: For an old man who had
a stroke, it is a long walk.

1017
00:55:58,321 --> 00:56:00,585
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to try it. See how long it took.

1018
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:01,748
JUROR #3: What do you mean,
you want to try it?

1019
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,689
Why didn't his lawyer bring it up
if it's so important?

1020
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:04,817
JUROR #5: Maybe he just didn't
think about it.

1021
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:05,986
What do you mean he didn't think of it?

1022
00:56:06,096 --> 00:56:07,154
Do you think the man's an idiot

1023
00:56:07,263 --> 00:56:08,958
- or something? It's an obvious thing.
- Did you think of it?

1024
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:10,054
Listen, smart guy. It don't matter whether

1025
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:11,224
I thought of it. He didn't bring it up

1026
00:56:11,334 --> 00:56:13,268
because he knew it'd hurt his case.
What do you think of that?

1027
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,337
Maybe he didn't bring it up

1028
00:56:14,471 --> 00:56:17,440
because it would have meant bullying
and badgering a helpless old man.

Those two chairs are the old man's bed.

I'll pace from that wall and back again.

wasting everybody's time in here for?

and his father a few hours earlier.

Then when he's lying in his bed,

he heard the body hit the floor
in the boy's apartment,

(SIGHING)

1175
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:18,145
Look at that come down, will you?

1176
01:05:19,448 --> 01:05:22,975
You know, this reminds me
of a storm we had last...

1177
01:05:25,488 --> 01:05:28,184
Was it November?
I don't know. Something.

1178
01:05:28,991 --> 01:05:32,927
It was quite a storm we had.
It was right in the middle of a game.

1179
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:35,589
We were behind 7-6.

1180
01:05:35,698 --> 01:05:38,223
But we'd just started to move the ball,
made a real tackle.

1181
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:42,998
It sort of cut right in, slash through,
slashed right in, cut right through.

1182
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:44,231
And...

1183
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:47,766
We had this kid, Slattery.

1184
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:51,712
He was an ox. You know, a real ox.

1185
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:55,016
I wish I had another one just like him.

1186
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:59,611
I forgot to tell you. I'm the assistant head
coach at Andrew J. McCorkle High School.

1187
01:05:59,722 --> 01:06:01,485
- Really?
- That's out in Queens.

1188
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:06,894
And anyway,
we're starting to move along real nice.

1189
01:06:06,996 --> 01:06:10,159
You know, their whole line
is just coming apart.

1190
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,995
And it starts to come down,
cats and dogs, just like this.

1191
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:17,731
Just... You know, right down.

1192
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:21,532
Well, it was murder, you know?

1193
01:06:22,678 --> 01:06:26,580
I swear, I nearly bawled.
We couldn't go nowhere.

1194
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:29,579
(SIGHING)

1195
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:48,861
Hey, what is it with this fan here?
How come...

1196
01:06:55,945 --> 01:06:57,242
(EX CLAIMS)

1197
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:02,183
Must have been
on the same switch with the lights.

1198
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:04,878
Well, things are looking up here, huh?

1199
01:07:06,055 --> 01:07:07,113
Yeah.

1200
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:14,091
Boy, that's better.

1201
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:23,398
Hey! Two points.

1202
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:30,278
Any of you guys ever go to the Garden?

1203
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:35,014
That's a damn stupid thing to do.

1204
01:07:35,818 --> 01:07:37,615
Oh, I'm sorry. I...

1205
01:07:39,088 --> 01:07:40,316
You know?

1206
01:07:41,924 --> 01:07:43,221
Pardon me.

1207
01:07:44,593 --> 01:07:48,689
Well, how do you like it? Even-steven.
Pretty surprising, isn't it?

1208
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:50,422
Yes.

1209
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:57,603
That business before, when that tall guy,
what's-his-name, was trying to bait me?

1210
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:01,708
That doesn't prove anything.
I'm a pretty excitable person.

1211
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:05,679
Where does he come off calling me
a public avenger, a sadist, and everything?

1212
01:08:05,781 --> 01:08:08,750
Anyone in his right mind
would blow his stack.

1213
01:08:09,218 --> 01:08:11,413
He was just trying to bait me.

1214
01:08:11,554 --> 01:08:13,488
He did an excellent job.

1215
01:08:16,325 --> 01:08:18,589
I'll tell you what I think,
we're going nowhere here.

1216
01:08:18,694 --> 01:08:21,128
I'm ready to walk into court right now
and declare a hung jury.

1217
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:22,788
There's no point in
this thing going on anymore.

1218
01:08:22,898 --> 01:08:24,126
Yeah, I go for that, too.

1219
01:08:24,233 --> 01:08:25,666
Listen, let's take it in to the judge and

1220
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:27,463
let the kid take his chances
with 12 other guys.

1221
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:29,037
I don't think the judge will accept
a hung jury.

1222
01:08:29,138 --> 01:08:30,605
We haven't been in here very long.

1223
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:33,834
- Well, let's find out.
- JUROR #11: I am not in favor of that.

1224
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:37,140
Listen, this kid wouldn't stand a chance
with another jury, and you know it.

1225
01:08:37,246 --> 01:08:39,214
Come on, we're hung.
Nobody's gonna change his vote.

1226
01:08:39,315 --> 01:08:40,339
Let's take it inside.

1227
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:42,474
You still don't think
there's room for reasonable doubt?

1228
01:08:42,585 --> 01:08:43,677
No, I don't.

1229
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:48,813
Pardon. Maybe you don't fully understand
the term "reasonable doubt".

1230
01:08:49,191 --> 01:08:51,751
What do you mean, I don't understand?

1231
01:08:52,194 --> 01:08:55,721
How do you like this guy?
I'm telling you, they're all alike.

1232
01:08:55,831 --> 01:08:58,891
They come over here, running for their life,
and before they can take a deep breath,

1233
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:01,435
they're telling us how to run the show.

1234
01:09:01,537 --> 01:09:04,404
- Boy, the arrogance of this guy!
- JUROR #1: All right.

1235
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:07,873
Let's stop the arguing
for about two minutes in here.

1236
01:09:08,043 --> 01:09:10,409
Now, who's got
something constructive to say?

1237
01:09:10,513 --> 01:09:14,108
I'd like to go over something,
if you gentlemen don't mind.

1238
01:09:14,216 --> 01:09:17,982
An important point
for the prosecution was the fact that

1239
01:09:18,087 --> 01:09:19,816
after the boy claimed
he'd been at the movies

1240
01:09:19,922 --> 01:09:21,549
during the hours
that the killing took place,

1241
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:23,215
he couldn't remember
the names of the movies

1242
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:25,759
or the stars who appeared in them.

1243
01:09:25,861 --> 01:09:28,329
This gentleman here has brought up
that point in here several times.

1244
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:29,863
That's correct.

1245
01:09:29,965 --> 01:09:31,626
It was the only alibi the boy offered,

1246
01:09:31,734 --> 01:09:34,396
and he himself couldn't back it up
with any details at all.

1247
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:37,734
Putting yourselves in the boy's place,
do you think you could remember details

1248
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,137
after an upsetting experience

1249
01:09:39,241 --> 01:09:41,266
such as being slapped in the face
by your father?

1250
01:09:41,377 --> 01:09:44,505
I think so, if there were
any special details to remember.

1251
01:09:44,613 --> 01:09:46,444
The boy couldn't remember the names
of the movies he saw,

1252
01:09:46,549 --> 01:09:48,073
because he wasn't there that night.

1253
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:49,845
According to the police testimony in court,

1254
01:09:49,952 --> 01:09:53,012
the boy was questioned by the detectives
in the kitchen of his apartment,

1255
01:09:53,122 --> 01:09:56,182
while the body of his father
was lying on the floor in the bedroom.

1256
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:58,760
Do you think you could remember details
under those circumstances?

1257
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:00,726
- I do.
- Under great emotional stress?

1258
01:10:00,829 --> 01:10:03,320
- Under great emotional stress.
- He remembered them correctly in court.

1259
01:10:03,432 --> 01:10:05,297
He named the pictures
and the stars who played in them.

1260
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:08,734
Yes. His lawyer took great pains
to bring that out.

1261
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:10,600
He had three months
from the night of the murder

1262
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:12,936
to the day of the trial
in which to memorize them.

1263
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:14,600
It's not difficult for a lawyer to find out

1264
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:17,508
what played at a particular theater
on a particular night.

1265
01:10:17,613 --> 01:10:19,171
I'll take the testimony of the policeman

1266
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:21,272
who interrogated the boy
right after the murder,

1267
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:25,877
when he couldn't remember a thing about
the movies, great emotional stress or not.

1268
01:10:25,988 --> 01:10:29,219
- I'd like to ask you a personal question.
- Go ahead.

1269
01:10:29,325 --> 01:10:32,453
- Where were you last night?
- I was home.

1270
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:33,789
How about the night before that?

1271
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:36,490
- JUROR #10: Come on. What is this?
- No, it's all right.

1272
01:10:36,599 --> 01:10:39,090
I left the office at 8:30
and went straight home and to bed.

1273
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:43,069
- And the night before that?
- That was Tuesday night.

1274
01:10:43,539 --> 01:10:45,530
The night of the bridge tournament.
I played bridge.

1275
01:10:45,641 --> 01:10:46,699
Monday night?

1276
01:10:46,809 --> 01:10:50,370
JUROR #7: When you get down
to New Year's Eve 1954, let me know.

1277
01:10:52,014 --> 01:10:53,447
Monday night?

1278
01:10:55,217 --> 01:10:58,448
Monday night,
my wife and I went to the movies.

1279
01:10:58,554 --> 01:11:00,044
- What did you see?
<i>- The Scarlet Circle.</i>

1280
01:11:00,155 --> 01:11:01,747
It is a very clever whodunit.

1281
01:11:01,857 --> 01:11:04,348
- What was the second feature?
- The...

1282
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:11,463
I'll tell you in a minute.
<i>The Remarkable Mrs...</i>

1283
01:11:12,568 --> 01:11:13,933
Something...

1284
01:11:15,838 --> 01:11:18,500
<i>Mrs. Bainbridge.</i>
<i>The Remarkable Mrs. Bainbridge.</i>

1285
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:21,872
I saw that.
It's called <i>The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge.</i>

1286
01:11:22,511 --> 01:11:24,911
Yes. <i>The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge.</i>
I think that's right.

1287
01:11:25,014 --> 01:11:27,448
Who was in <i>The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge?</i>

1288
01:11:27,549 --> 01:11:32,748
Barbara Long, I think it was.
A dark, very pretty girl.

1289
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:38,055
- Ling, or Long. Something like that.
- Who else?

1290
01:11:38,193 --> 01:11:40,457
I'd never heard of them before.

1291
01:11:40,663 --> 01:11:44,190
It was a very inexpensive
second feature, with unknown...

1292
01:11:45,067 --> 01:11:48,332
And you weren't under
an emotional stress, were you?

1293
01:11:50,839 --> 01:11:51,863
No.

1294
01:11:53,375 --> 01:11:54,603
I wasn't.

1295
01:11:56,898 --> 01:11:59,799
- I think the point is made.
- Big point.

1296
01:12:01,435 --> 01:12:05,371
You can talk till your tongue is dragging
on the floor. The boy is guilty. Period.

1297
01:12:05,473 --> 01:12:07,566
Know what I mean, my friend?

1298
01:12:07,875 --> 01:12:11,402
- You got those cough drops?
- They're all gone, my friend.

1299
01:12:13,281 --> 01:12:16,773
Oh, boy. Look at that rain.
There goes your ball game.

1300
01:12:18,052 --> 01:12:19,747
It's only a shower.

1301
01:12:20,454 --> 01:12:23,048
Besides, they got the infield covered.

1302
01:12:23,157 --> 01:12:26,058
Say, could I see that knife
a second, please?

1303
01:12:28,629 --> 01:12:32,395
Well, we're still tied up 6-6.
Who's got a suggestion?

1304
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:34,931
It's 6:05. Let's get some dinner.

1305
01:12:35,036 --> 01:12:37,561
Why don't we wait till 7:00?
Give it another hour.

1306
01:12:37,672 --> 01:12:39,105
Okay with me.

1307
01:12:39,207 --> 01:12:41,869
There's something I'd like to say.

1308
01:12:41,976 --> 01:12:45,878
I mean, it's been bothering me a little,
and as long as we're stuck...

1309
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:49,882
There was this whole business about
the stab wound and how it was made.

1310
01:12:49,984 --> 01:12:51,281
The downward angle of it, you know?

1311
01:12:51,385 --> 01:12:53,478
Don't tell me
we're gonna start with that again.

1312
01:12:53,588 --> 01:12:55,055
They've been over it and over it.

1313
01:12:55,156 --> 01:12:57,556
I know they did,
but I don't go along with it.

1314
01:12:57,658 --> 01:13:01,594
Now, the boy was 5'7" tall.
His father was 6'2".

1315
01:13:01,863 --> 01:13:04,263
That's a difference of seven inches.

1316
01:13:04,365 --> 01:13:06,492
It's a very awkward thing
to stab down into the chest

1317
01:13:06,601 --> 01:13:08,592
of someone who's more than half a foot
taller than you are.

1318
01:13:08,703 --> 01:13:10,136
Give me that.

1319
01:13:11,038 --> 01:13:14,064
I'll give you a demonstration.
Somebody get up.

1320
01:13:21,782 --> 01:13:24,182
I want you to watch this
'cause I don't wanna have to do it again.

1321
01:13:24,285 --> 01:13:27,277
I'll make myself about
six or seven inches shorter. Okay?

1322
01:13:27,388 --> 01:13:31,256
- That's about right. Maybe a little more.
- Okay, a little more.

1323
01:13:38,399 --> 01:13:39,832
(ALL YELLING)

1324
01:13:42,737 --> 01:13:44,602
Now, nobody's hurt.

1325
01:13:46,107 --> 01:13:48,166
- Right?
- Right. Nobody hurt.

1326
01:13:52,446 --> 01:13:56,906
Now, this is the way I'd stab a man
who was taller than I was.

1327
01:13:57,418 --> 01:13:59,784
Look at the angle. Down and in.

1328
01:14:00,154 --> 01:14:03,646
And this is the way it was done.
Now tell me I'm wrong.

1329
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:07,925
Down and in. I guess there's no argument.

1330
01:14:08,029 --> 01:14:09,894
Hold on a minute, will you?

1331
01:14:09,997 --> 01:14:11,828
Will you give me that?

1332
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:14,668
Boy, I hate these things.

1333
01:14:14,769 --> 01:14:16,430
- Did you ever see a knife fight?
- No.

1334
01:14:16,537 --> 01:14:17,697
- You?
- No.

1335
01:14:18,172 --> 01:14:20,663
Anybody here ever see a knife fight?

1336
01:14:21,175 --> 01:14:25,908
Well, I have. You know, on my back stoop,
the lot across the street, backyard.

1337
01:14:26,347 --> 01:14:29,077
Switchblades came
with the neighborhood where I lived.

1338
01:14:29,183 --> 01:14:32,016
Funny I never thought of it before.
I guess you try to forget those things.

1339
01:14:32,119 --> 01:14:36,215
- How do you use a switchblade?
- Well, you'd never use it like this.

1340
01:14:37,358 --> 01:14:40,327
See, you'd lose too much time
switching hands.

1341
01:14:41,462 --> 01:14:43,589
Here's how. Underhanded.

1342
01:14:46,801 --> 01:14:49,964
Anyone who's ever used a switch knife
wouldn't handle it any other way.

1343
01:14:50,071 --> 01:14:52,005
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

1344
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:54,271
It's why they're made to open like that.

1345
01:14:54,375 --> 01:14:57,139
You'd say the boy was pretty handy
with a knife?

1346
01:14:57,244 --> 01:15:00,270
You think he could have made
the kind of wound that killed his father?

1347
01:15:00,381 --> 01:15:04,408
No. Not with the experience he got
all his life handling these things.

1348
01:15:04,518 --> 01:15:06,315
I feel he'd have gone for him underhanded.

1349
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:07,717
How do you know?

1350
01:15:07,822 --> 01:15:09,619
Were you in the room
when the father was killed?

1351
01:15:09,724 --> 01:15:11,487
No. Neither was anybody else.

1352
01:15:11,592 --> 01:15:15,119
Then what are you giving us all this
mumbo jumbo for? I don't believe it.

1353
01:15:15,229 --> 01:15:17,060
JUROR #4: I don't think you can determine
what type of wound

1354
01:15:17,164 --> 01:15:18,495
the boy might or might not have made

1355
01:15:18,599 --> 01:15:20,533
simply because he knew
how to handle a knife.

1356
01:15:20,634 --> 01:15:24,195
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

1357
01:15:24,305 --> 01:15:27,433
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- I don't know.

1358
01:15:31,712 --> 01:15:33,179
How about you?

1359
01:15:33,748 --> 01:15:34,908
I don't know about the rest of them,

1360
01:15:35,016 --> 01:15:37,484
but I'm getting a little tired
of this yakkety-yakking back and forth.

1361
01:15:37,585 --> 01:15:41,043
It's getting us nowhere.
So I guess I'll have to break it up.

1362
01:15:41,155 --> 01:15:43,623
I'm changing my vote to not guilty.

1363
01:15:43,924 --> 01:15:46,859
- You're what?
- You heard me. I've had enough.

1364
01:15:47,094 --> 01:15:49,358
What do you mean you've had enough?
That's no answer.

1365
01:15:49,463 --> 01:15:52,159
Listen, you just take care of yourself.

1366
01:15:52,633 --> 01:15:54,464
- You know?
- JUROR #11: He's right.

1367
01:15:55,336 --> 01:15:57,099
That's not an answer.

1368
01:15:57,872 --> 01:15:59,931
What kind of a man are you?

1369
01:16:00,975 --> 01:16:04,138
You have sat here and
voted guilty with everyone else

1370
01:16:04,245 --> 01:16:08,409
because there are some baseball tickets
burning a hole in your pocket.

1371
01:16:08,516 --> 01:16:13,385
Now you have changed your vote because
you say you're sick of all the talking here?

1372
01:16:13,487 --> 01:16:15,045
JUROR #7: Now, listen, buddy...

1373
01:16:15,156 --> 01:16:19,889
Who tells you that you have the right
to play like this with a man's life?

1374
01:16:19,994 --> 01:16:22,462
- Don't you care...
- Now, wait a minute.

1375
01:16:22,563 --> 01:16:26,590
- You can't talk like that to me.
- I can talk like that to you.

1376
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:28,497
If you want to vote not guilty,

1377
01:16:28,602 --> 01:16:30,968
then do it because you are convinced
the man is not guilty,

1378
01:16:31,072 --> 01:16:32,801
not because you've had enough.

1379
01:16:32,907 --> 01:16:35,876
And if you think he is guilty,
then vote that way.

1380
01:16:35,976 --> 01:16:38,911
Or don't you have the guts
to do what you think is right?

1381
01:16:39,013 --> 01:16:41,573
- Now, listen...
- Guilty or not guilty?

1382
01:16:41,949 --> 01:16:45,043
- I told you. Not guilty.
- Why?

1383
01:16:47,321 --> 01:16:51,382
- Look, I don't have to...
- You do have to. Say it. Why?

1384
01:16:52,293 --> 01:16:55,160
I don't think he's guilty.

1385
01:17:04,171 --> 01:17:05,604
I want another vote.

1386
01:17:05,706 --> 01:17:08,266
JUROR #1: Okay,
that's another vote called for.

1387
01:17:08,375 --> 01:17:11,401
I guess the quickest way
is a show of hands. Anyone object?

1388
01:17:11,512 --> 01:17:14,777
Okay, all those voting not guilty,
raise your hands.

1389
01:17:15,182 --> 01:17:17,616
One, two, three,

1390
01:17:17,751 --> 01:17:20,777
four, five, six, seven,

1391
01:17:23,424 --> 01:17:24,550
eight.

1392
01:17:30,064 --> 01:17:31,122
Nine.

1393
01:17:33,734 --> 01:17:36,532
All those voting guilty, raise your hands.

1394
01:17:36,871 --> 01:17:38,429
One, two, three.

1395
01:17:39,473 --> 01:17:42,977
Well, the vote's 9-3 in favor of acquittal.

1396
01:17:43,110 --> 01:17:45,203
I don't understand you people!

1397
01:17:45,312 --> 01:17:48,873
All these picky little points you keep
bringing up, they don't mean nothing!

1398
01:17:48,983 --> 01:17:50,951
You saw this kid just like I did.

1399
01:17:51,051 --> 01:17:54,452
You're not gonna tell me you believe that
phony story about losing the knife

1400
01:17:54,555 --> 01:17:56,682
and that business
about being at the movies!

1401
01:17:56,790 --> 01:17:59,623
Look, you know how these people lie.
It's born in them.

1402
01:17:59,727 --> 01:18:03,754
What the heck? I don't have to tell you.
They don't know what the truth is!

1403
01:18:03,864 --> 01:18:07,630
And let me tell you, they don't need
any real big reason to kill someone, either.

1404
01:18:07,735 --> 01:18:12,672
No, sir. They get drunk.
They're real big drinkers, all of them.

1405
01:18:12,773 --> 01:18:15,867
You know that. And bang!
Someone's lying in the gutter.

1406
01:18:15,976 --> 01:18:19,002
Nobody's blaming them for it.
That's the way they are, by nature.

1407
01:18:19,113 --> 01:18:22,344
You know what I mean? Violent.
Where are you going?

1408
01:18:22,616 --> 01:18:26,052
Human life don't mean
as much to them as it does to us.

1409
01:18:26,921 --> 01:18:29,685
Look, they're lushing it up
and fighting all the time,

1410
01:18:29,790 --> 01:18:33,123
and if somebody gets killed,
so somebody gets killed! They don't care!

1411
01:18:33,227 --> 01:18:35,559
Sure, there's some good things
about them, too.

1412
01:18:35,663 --> 01:18:37,290
Look, I'm the first one to say that.

1413
01:18:37,398 --> 01:18:39,127
I've known a couple who were okay,

1414
01:18:39,233 --> 01:18:41,064
but that's the exception.
You know what I mean?

1415
01:18:41,168 --> 01:18:44,865
Most of them, it's like they have
no feelings! They can do anything!

1416
01:18:44,972 --> 01:18:46,735
What's going on here?

1417
01:18:47,608 --> 01:18:51,544
I'm trying to tell you.
You're making a big mistake, you people.

1418
01:18:51,745 --> 01:18:55,078
This kid is a liar. I know it.
I know all about them.

1419
01:18:56,684 --> 01:19:00,916
Listen to me. They're no good.
There's not one of them who's any good.

1420
01:19:03,157 --> 01:19:07,890
I mean, what's happening in here?
I speak my piece, and you...

1421
01:19:09,196 --> 01:19:10,629
Listen to me.

1422
01:19:13,467 --> 01:19:14,434
(STUTTERING) We're...

1423
01:19:14,535 --> 01:19:18,562
This kid on trial here. His type.
Well, don't you know about them?

1424
01:19:19,907 --> 01:19:22,375
There's a... There's a danger here.

1425
01:19:23,611 --> 01:19:27,513
These people are dangerous. They're wild.

1426
01:19:28,949 --> 01:19:31,247
Listen to me. Listen to me.

1427
01:19:32,086 --> 01:19:35,749
I have. Now, sit down
and don't open your mouth again.

1428
01:19:40,227 --> 01:19:42,627
Some of the time... I tell you.

1429
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:23,860
It's always difficult to keep personal
prejudice out of a thing like this.

1430
01:20:24,772 --> 01:20:28,572
Wherever you run into it,
prejudice always obscures the truth.

1431
01:20:30,377 --> 01:20:32,937
I don't really know what the truth is.

1432
01:20:33,047 --> 01:20:36,141
I don't suppose anybody
will ever really know.

1433
01:20:36,984 --> 01:20:40,681
Nine of us now seem to feel
that the defendant is innocent.

1434
01:20:41,221 --> 01:20:45,248
But we're just gambling on probabilities.
We may be wrong.

1435
01:20:46,226 --> 01:20:51,357
We may be trying to let a guilty man
go free. I don't know. Nobody really can.

1436
01:20:52,266 --> 01:20:54,530
But we have a reasonable doubt,

1437
01:20:54,868 --> 01:20:58,269
and that's something
that's very valuable in our system.

1438
01:20:58,372 --> 01:21:02,604
No jury can declare a man guilty
unless it's sure.

1439
01:21:04,411 --> 01:21:09,178
We nine can't understand
how you three are still so sure.

1440
01:21:10,351 --> 01:21:12,717
- Maybe you can tell us.
- I'll try.

1441
01:21:13,787 --> 01:21:15,448
You've made some excellent points,

1442
01:21:15,556 --> 01:21:18,650
but I still believe the boy is guilty
of murder, and I have two reasons.

1443
01:21:19,326 --> 01:21:22,193
One, the evidence given by
the woman across the street,

1444
01:21:22,296 --> 01:21:24,890
who actually saw the murder committed.

1445
01:21:25,165 --> 01:21:27,725
As far as I'm concerned,
that's the most important testimony.

1446
01:21:27,835 --> 01:21:30,360
And two, the fact that
she described the stabbing

1447
01:21:30,471 --> 01:21:33,736
by saying she saw the boy
raise his arm over his head

1448
01:21:33,841 --> 01:21:36,435
and stab down into the father's chest.

1449
01:21:36,744 --> 01:21:40,441
- She saw him do it, the wrong way.
- That's absolutely right.

1450
01:21:41,248 --> 01:21:43,546
JUROR #4: Let's talk about
this woman for a moment.

1451
01:21:43,650 --> 01:21:46,710
She said she went to bed
about 11:00 that night.

1452
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:50,381
Her bed was next to the window,
and she could look out while lying down

1453
01:21:50,491 --> 01:21:53,927
and see directly into the boy's room
across the street.

1454
01:21:54,595 --> 01:21:57,257
She tossed and turned for over an hour,
unable to sleep.

1455
01:21:57,364 --> 01:22:01,460
Finally, she turned toward the window
at about 12:10,

1456
01:22:01,602 --> 01:22:06,767
and as she looked out, she saw the killing
through the windows of a passing El train.

1457
01:22:06,940 --> 01:22:09,465
She said the lights went out
immediately after the killing,

1458
01:22:09,576 --> 01:22:14,445
but that she got a good look at the boy
in the act of stabbing his father.

1459
01:22:15,516 --> 01:22:19,077
As far as I can see it,
this is unshakeable testimony.

1460
01:22:20,087 --> 01:22:22,988
- Well, that's the whole case.
- What do you think?

1461
01:22:27,895 --> 01:22:29,385
How about you?

1462
01:22:31,899 --> 01:22:37,804
I don't know. So much evidence to sift.
This is a pretty complicated business.

1463
01:22:37,938 --> 01:22:41,237
Frankly, I don't see
how you can vote for acquittal.

1464
01:22:42,176 --> 01:22:44,371
It's not so easy to arrange
all the evidence in order.

1465
01:22:44,478 --> 01:22:46,207
JUROR #3: You can throw out
all the other evidence!

1466
01:22:46,313 --> 01:22:49,339
The woman saw him do it!
What else do you want?

1467
01:22:50,083 --> 01:22:52,074
- Well, maybe...
- JUROR #8: Let's vote on it.

1468
01:22:52,186 --> 01:22:55,519
JUROR #1: Okay, there's another vote
called for. Anyone object?

1469
01:22:56,323 --> 01:22:59,417
All right. I'm changing my vote.
He's guilty.

1470
01:22:59,626 --> 01:23:01,821
Anybody else? The vote is 8-4.

1471
01:23:01,929 --> 01:23:05,262
Why is this such a personal triumph
for you, this one vote?

1472
01:23:05,699 --> 01:23:09,157
Okay. I say we're a hung jury.
I say we take it in to the judge.

1473
01:23:09,269 --> 01:23:11,829
How about it? I wanna hear arguments.

1474
01:23:12,039 --> 01:23:15,270
You, you're the leader of the cause.
What about it?

1475
01:23:16,944 --> 01:23:18,411
Let's go over it again.

1476
01:23:18,512 --> 01:23:22,346
We've been over it again.
The boy in the gray flannel suit here

1477
01:23:22,449 --> 01:23:25,247
is bouncing backwards and forwards
like a tennis ball.

1478
01:23:25,352 --> 01:23:30,085
There's no point in getting nasty.
You keep trying to turn this into a contest.

1479
01:23:31,525 --> 01:23:32,651
Okay.

1480
01:23:32,759 --> 01:23:35,694
Maybe we can talk about
setting some kind of time limit.

1481
01:23:35,796 --> 01:23:38,287
Yeah. Once around for the deal, huh?

1482
01:23:38,966 --> 01:23:44,529
It's 6:15. Someone before mentioned 7:00.

1483
01:23:44,872 --> 01:23:47,272
I think that's a point at which
we might begin to discuss the question

1484
01:23:47,374 --> 01:23:49,865
of whether we're a hung jury or not.

1485
01:23:50,611 --> 01:23:52,340
Don't you feel well?

1486
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:55,473
I feel perfectly well, thank you.

1487
01:23:55,582 --> 01:23:58,380
I was saying that 7:00
would be a reasonable time...

1488
01:23:58,485 --> 01:24:00,715
The reason I asked about that

1489
01:24:00,821 --> 01:24:02,880
was because you were
rubbing your nose like...

1490
01:24:02,990 --> 01:24:05,720
Oh, I'm sorry for interrupting.

1491
01:24:05,859 --> 01:24:09,056
But you made a gesture
that reminded me of something.

1492
01:24:09,162 --> 01:24:11,153
I'm trying to settle something here.
Do you mind?

1493
01:24:11,265 --> 01:24:13,460
Well, I think this is important.

1494
01:24:14,501 --> 01:24:18,835
Thank you. Now, then,
I'm sure you'll pardon me for this,

1495
01:24:18,939 --> 01:24:22,238
but I was wondering
why you rub your nose like that?

1496
01:24:22,342 --> 01:24:23,468
JUROR #3: Come on, will you?

1497
01:24:23,577 --> 01:24:27,911
At this point, I happen to be talking
to the gentleman sitting next to you.

1498
01:24:28,015 --> 01:24:30,984
Now, why were you rubbing
your nose like that?

1499
01:24:31,585 --> 01:24:35,248
If it's any of your business, I was
rubbing it because it bothers me a little.

1500
01:24:35,355 --> 01:24:39,382
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is it because of your eyeglasses?

1501
01:24:39,493 --> 01:24:42,758
It is.
Now could we get onto something else?

1502
01:24:42,863 --> 01:24:47,527
Your eyeglasses made those two deep
impressions on the sides of your nose.

1503
01:24:47,634 --> 01:24:51,092
I hadn't noticed that before.
That must be annoying.

1504
01:24:51,538 --> 01:24:53,267
It is very annoying.

1505
01:24:53,574 --> 01:24:58,910
I wouldn't know about that.
I've never worn eyeglasses. 20/20.

1506
01:24:59,012 --> 01:25:02,607
Listen, will you come on already
with the optometrist bit?

1507
01:25:03,250 --> 01:25:06,310
The woman who testified
that she saw the killing

1508
01:25:06,987 --> 01:25:10,115
had those same marks
on the sides of her nose.

1509
01:25:11,458 --> 01:25:13,426
JUROR #5: Holy smokes!
You know, he's right.

1510
01:25:13,527 --> 01:25:18,464
Please. Just give me a minute,
and I'll be finished.

1511
01:25:19,333 --> 01:25:22,325
I don't know if anyone else
noticed that about her.

1512
01:25:22,436 --> 01:25:28,204
I didn't think of it then, but I've been
going over her face in my mind.

1513
01:25:29,443 --> 01:25:33,971
She had those same marks.
She kept rubbing them in court.

1514
01:25:34,147 --> 01:25:36,547
He's right. She did do that a lot.

1515
01:25:37,584 --> 01:25:41,486
This woman was about 45 years old.

1516
01:25:42,422 --> 01:25:45,789
She was making
a tremendous effort to look 35,

1517
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:51,520
for her first public appearance.
Heavy make-up. Dyed hair.

1518
01:25:52,132 --> 01:25:56,034
Brand-new clothes that should have
been worn by a younger woman.

1519
01:25:56,136 --> 01:26:01,938
No glasses. Well, women do that.
See if you can get a mental picture of her.

1520
01:26:02,142 --> 01:26:03,973
What do you mean, no glasses?

1521
01:26:04,077 --> 01:26:05,567
How do you know
whether she wore glasses?

1522
01:26:05,679 --> 01:26:09,206
- Just 'cause she was rubbing her nose?
- She had those marks. I saw them.

1523
01:26:09,316 --> 01:26:10,977
So what? What do you think that means?

1524
01:26:11,084 --> 01:26:12,779
Listen, I'm getting so sick
of your yelling in here...

1525
01:26:12,886 --> 01:26:14,251
Come on. Forget it.

1526
01:26:14,354 --> 01:26:18,723
Hey, listen. Listen, he's right. I saw
them too. I was the closest one to her.

1527
01:26:18,825 --> 01:26:20,690
She had these things
on the side of her nose.

1528
01:26:20,794 --> 01:26:22,159
What do you call those, on the side?

1529
01:26:22,396 --> 01:26:23,863
What point are you making here?

1530
01:26:23,964 --> 01:26:27,866
She had dyed hair, marks on her nose.
What does that mean?

1531
01:26:28,001 --> 01:26:32,097
Could those marks be made
by anything other than eyeglasses?

1532
01:26:35,742 --> 01:26:37,369
No. They couldn't.

1533
01:26:38,211 --> 01:26:40,076
JUROR #3: I didn't see any marks!

1534
01:26:41,948 --> 01:26:45,543
I did.
Strange, but I didn't think about it before.

1535
01:26:46,053 --> 01:26:48,321
What about the lawyer?
Why didn't he say something?

1536
01:26:48,321 --> 01:26:48,685
What about the lawyer?
Why didn't he say something?

1537
01:26:48,789 --> 01:26:51,519
There are 12 people in here
concentrating on this case.

1538
01:26:51,625 --> 01:26:55,026
- Eleven of us didn't think of it either.
- What about the district attorney?

1539
01:26:55,128 --> 01:26:58,825
You think he'd pull a trick like that?
Have her testify without her glasses?

1540
01:26:58,932 --> 01:27:00,593
Did you ever see a woman
who had to wear glasses

1541
01:27:00,701 --> 01:27:03,261
and didn't want to
because she thinks they spoil her looks?

1542
01:27:03,370 --> 01:27:07,670
Okay, she had marks on her nose.
I'm giving you that.

1543
01:27:08,241 --> 01:27:10,141
From glasses, right?

1544
01:27:10,243 --> 01:27:11,710
She didn't wanna wear them
out of the house

1545
01:27:11,812 --> 01:27:14,212
so people would think she's gorgeous.

1546
01:27:14,815 --> 01:27:19,149
But when she saw this kid killing
his father, she was in the house alone.

1547
01:27:19,252 --> 01:27:20,583
That's all.

1548
01:27:21,455 --> 01:27:23,446
Do you wear glasses when you go to bed?

1549
01:27:23,657 --> 01:27:25,215
No, I don't.

1550
01:27:27,327 --> 01:27:29,090
No one wears eyeglasses to bed.

1551
01:27:29,196 --> 01:27:30,993
JUROR #8: It's logical to assume
that she wasn't wearing them

1552
01:27:31,098 --> 01:27:33,828
when she was in bed, tossing and turning,
trying to fall asleep.

1553
01:27:33,967 --> 01:27:36,333
- How do you know?
- I don't know. I'm guessing.

1554
01:27:36,436 --> 01:27:38,996
I'm also guessing that
she probably didn't put her glasses on

1555
01:27:39,106 --> 01:27:40,971
when she turned and looked
casually out of the window.

1556
01:27:41,074 --> 01:27:44,271
And she herself testified the killing
took place just as she looked out.

1557
01:27:44,377 --> 01:27:45,708
The lights went off a split-second later.

1558
01:27:45,812 --> 01:27:47,370
She couldn't have had time to
put them on then.

1559
01:27:47,481 --> 01:27:48,812
- JUROR #3: Wait a second...
- Here's another guess.

1560
01:27:48,915 --> 01:27:51,247
Maybe she honestly thought
she saw the boy kill his father.

1561
01:27:51,351 --> 01:27:52,943
I say she only saw a blur.

1562
01:27:53,053 --> 01:27:56,216
How do you know what she saw?
How does he know all that?

1563
01:27:56,923 --> 01:27:58,515
How do you know what kind of
glasses she wore?

1564
01:27:58,625 --> 01:27:59,649
Maybe they were sunglasses!

1565
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:02,422
Maybe she was far-sighted!
What do you know about her?

1566
01:28:02,629 --> 01:28:05,655
I only know the woman's eyesight
is in question now.

1567
01:28:05,766 --> 01:28:11,636
She had to be able to identify a person
60 feet away, at night, without glasses.

1568
01:28:11,738 --> 01:28:14,639
You can't send someone off to die
on evidence like that.

1569
01:28:14,741 --> 01:28:16,504
Don't give me that.

1570
01:28:16,610 --> 01:28:18,544
Don't you think the woman
might have made a mistake?

1571
01:28:18,645 --> 01:28:19,737
No.

1572
01:28:19,846 --> 01:28:22,644
- It's not possible?
- No, it's not possible.

1573
01:28:25,819 --> 01:28:27,309
Is it possible?

1574
01:28:28,822 --> 01:28:30,153
Not guilty.

1575
01:28:34,628 --> 01:28:36,596
Do you think he's guilty?

1576
01:28:37,430 --> 01:28:39,159
I think he's guilty.

1577
01:28:42,135 --> 01:28:43,295
Do you?

1578
01:28:46,740 --> 01:28:47,729
No.

1579
01:28:48,208 --> 01:28:50,938
I'm convinced. Not guilty.

1580
01:28:51,344 --> 01:28:55,041
- JUROR #3: What's the matter with you?
- I have a reasonable doubt now.

1581
01:28:55,282 --> 01:28:56,715
It's eleven to one.

1582
01:28:56,817 --> 01:29:00,048
What about all the other evidence?
What about all that stuff?

1583
01:29:00,153 --> 01:29:02,087
(STUTTERING) The knife?
The whole business?

1584
01:29:02,189 --> 01:29:05,716
Well, you said we could
throw out all the other evidence.

1585
01:29:10,931 --> 01:29:12,922
JUROR #7: Well, what do we do now?

1586
01:29:16,069 --> 01:29:17,502
You're alone.

1587
01:29:18,138 --> 01:29:21,471
I don't care whether I'm alone or not.
It's my right.

1588
01:29:24,945 --> 01:29:26,503
It's your right.

1589
01:29:36,056 --> 01:29:38,854
Well, what do you want? I say he's guilty.

1590
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:43,755
- We want to hear your arguments.
- I gave you my arguments.

1591
01:29:44,698 --> 01:29:47,758
We're not convinced.
We want to hear them again.

1592
01:29:49,502 --> 01:29:51,868
We have as much time as it takes.

1593
01:29:57,310 --> 01:30:01,838
Everything. Every single thing
that took place in that courtroom,

1594
01:30:01,948 --> 01:30:03,813
but I mean everything, says he's guilty.

1595
01:30:03,917 --> 01:30:06,886
What do you think?
I'm an idiot or something?

1596
01:30:08,021 --> 01:30:09,989
Why don't you take that stuff
about the old man.

1597
01:30:10,090 --> 01:30:13,253
The old man who lived there
and heard everything!

1598
01:30:14,928 --> 01:30:16,156
Or this business about the knife.

1599
01:30:16,263 --> 01:30:18,731
What? 'Cause he found
another one exactly like it?

1600
01:30:18,832 --> 01:30:21,892
The old man saw him!
Right there, on the stairs.

1601
01:30:22,202 --> 01:30:25,171
What's the difference
how many seconds it was?

1602
01:30:26,339 --> 01:30:28,034
Every single thing.

1603
01:30:29,509 --> 01:30:32,535
The knife falling through a hole
in his pocket.

1604
01:30:32,913 --> 01:30:35,711
You can't prove he didn't get to the door!

1605
01:30:36,316 --> 01:30:41,117
Sure, you can take all the time, hobble
around the room, but you can't prove it!

1606
01:30:43,723 --> 01:30:47,056
And what about this business of the EI?
And the movies?

1607
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:49,958
There's a phony deal if I ever heard one.

1608
01:30:50,163 --> 01:30:54,327
I'll bet you $5,000
I'd remember the movies I saw.

1609
01:30:54,434 --> 01:30:59,804
I'm telling you, everything that's gone on
has been twisted and turned!

1610
