Premeditated murder

to you and interpreted
as it applies in this case

It's now your duty to sit down

then you must bring me
a verdict of not guilty.

If, however, there's no
reasonable doubt, then you
must, in good conscience,

find the accused guilty.

You fellows can
handle this thing
any way that you want to.

154
00:10:32,192 --> 00:10:34,695
I'm... You know,
I'm not going
to make any rules.

155
00:10:35,195 --> 00:10:38,198
We can, well,
discuss it first,
and then vote on it.

156
00:10:38,198 --> 00:10:40,701
That's, of course...
That's one way.

157
00:10:40,701 --> 00:10:43,670
And, well, we can vote on it
right now, then.

158
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:46,673
I think it's customary
to take a preliminary vote.

159
00:10:46,673 --> 00:10:48,675
Yeah, let's vote.

160
00:10:48,675 --> 00:10:50,761
Who knows?
Maybe we can all
get out of here.

161
00:10:50,761 --> 00:10:51,762
Uh-huh.

162
00:10:51,762 --> 00:10:55,766
Okay. Then I think that,
of course, you know that

163
00:10:55,766 --> 00:10:58,268
we have a first-degree
murder charge here,

164
00:10:58,268 --> 00:11:00,854
and if we vote
the accused guilty,

165
00:11:01,355 --> 00:11:03,857
we've got to send
him to the chair.

166
00:11:04,858 --> 00:11:05,859
That's mandatory.

167
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:06,860
I think we
know that.

168
00:11:07,361 --> 00:11:09,363
Yeah, let's se
e who's where.

169
00:11:09,363 --> 00:11:10,864
JUROR #1: Okay.
Anyone doesn't want to vote?

170
00:11:10,864 --> 00:11:14,201
JUROR #12:
It's fine with me.

171
00:11:14,201 --> 00:11:19,706
Okay, then, just remember
that this has to be 12
to nothing, either way.

172
00:11:19,706 --> 00:11:22,576
That's the law.
Okay, are we ready?

173
00:11:23,076 --> 00:11:26,580
All those voting guilty,
please raise your hands.

174
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:33,587
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

175
00:11:34,588 --> 00:11:37,674
eight, nine, ten, eleven.

176
00:11:37,674 --> 00:11:40,177
.
Okay, that's 11 guilty

177
00:11:40,177 --> 00:11:42,179
Those voting not guilty?

178
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:45,182
One. Right.

179
00:11:45,182 --> 00:11:48,185
.
11 guilty,
one not guilty

180
00:11:48,185 --> 00:11:49,936
Well, now we know
where we are.

181
00:11:50,437 --> 00:11:53,440
.
Boy, oh, boy!
There's always one

182
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,441
)
(CHUCKLING

183
00:11:54,441 --> 00:11:56,943
So, what do we do now?

184
00:11:57,444 --> 00:11:58,445
I guess we talk.

185
00:11:58,445 --> 00:12:00,447
JUROR #10: Boy, oh, boy!

186
00:12:00,447 --> 00:12:03,250
You really think
he's innocent?

187
00:12:05,752 --> 00:12:07,754
I don't know.

188
00:12:07,754 --> 00:12:10,173
You sat in court
with the rest of us.
You heard what we did.

189
00:12:10,173 --> 00:12:12,292
The kid's a dangerous killer,
you could see it.

190
00:12:12,292 --> 00:12:14,177
He's 18 years old.

191
00:12:14,177 --> 00:12:16,179
Well, that's old enough.

192
00:12:16,179 --> 00:12:19,015
.
He stabbed his own father
four inches into the chest

193
00:12:19,015 --> 00:12:21,518
They proved it a dozen
different ways in court.

194
00:12:21,518 --> 00:12:23,520
Would you like me
to list them for you?

195
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,439
No.

196
00:12:25,939 --> 00:12:27,441
Then what
do you want?

197
00:12:27,441 --> 00:12:28,942
I just want to talk.

198
00:12:28,942 --> 00:12:30,444
What's there
to talk about?

199
00:12:30,444 --> 00:12:31,945
11 men in here
think he's guilty.

200
00:12:31,945 --> 00:12:34,448
No one had to think
about it twice,
except you.

201
00:12:34,448 --> 00:12:35,449
I want to ask
you something.

202
00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:37,451
Do you believe
his story?

203
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:39,953
I don't know whether
I believe it or not.
Maybe I don't.

204
00:12:39,953 --> 00:12:42,406
So how come you
vote not guilty?

205
00:12:42,406 --> 00:12:43,907
There were 11 vote
s for guilty.

206
00:12:43,907 --> 00:12:45,409
It's not easy
to raise my hand

207
00:12:45,409 --> 00:12:48,912
and send a boy off
to die without talking
about it first.

208
00:12:48,912 --> 00:12:50,414
Well, now,
who says it's easy?

209
00:12:50,414 --> 00:12:51,415
No one.

210
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,918
What? Just because
I voted fast?

211
00:12:54,918 --> 00:12:57,421
I honestly think
the guy is guilty.

212
00:12:57,421 --> 00:12:59,923
Couldn't change my mind
if you talked for 100 years.

213
00:13:00,424 --> 00:13:01,425
I'm not trying
to change your mind.

214
00:13:01,925 --> 00:13:02,926
It's just that...

215
00:13:02,926 --> 00:13:04,928
We're talking about
somebody's life here.

216
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:07,431
We can't decide it
in five minutes.
Supposing we're wrong?

217
00:13:07,431 --> 00:13:08,932
Supposing we're wrong.

218
00:13:08,932 --> 00:13:10,934
Supposing this building
should fall down on my head?

219
00:13:10,934 --> 00:13:12,436
You can suppose anything.

220
00:13:12,436 --> 00:13:13,937
That's right.

221
00:13:13,937 --> 00:13:16,323
What's the difference
how long it takes?

222
00:13:16,323 --> 00:13:18,942
Supposing we do it
in five minutes?
So what?

223
00:13:18,942 --> 00:13:22,245
Let's take an hour.
The ball game
doesn't start till 8:00.

224
00:13:28,835 --> 00:13:30,170
Who's got
something to say?

225
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,088
I'm willing
to sit for an hour.

226
00:13:32,088 --> 00:13:34,591
Great. I heard
a pretty good stor
y last night...

227
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:37,511
That's not why
we're sitting here.

228
00:13:37,511 --> 00:13:39,513
All right,
then you tell me.

229
00:13:39,513 --> 00:13:41,214
What are we
sitting here for?

230
00:13:42,716 --> 00:13:45,218
I don't know.
Maybe no reason.

231
00:13:45,218 --> 00:13:48,722
Look, this kid's
been kicked around
all of his life.

232
00:13:48,722 --> 00:13:52,726
You know, born in a slum,
mother dead since he was nine.

233
00:13:52,726 --> 00:13:54,227
He lived for a year and a half
in an orphanage

234
00:13:54,728 --> 00:13:58,231
when his father was
serving a jail term
for forgery.

235
00:13:58,231 --> 00:14:00,734
That's not a very
happy beginning.

236
00:14:00,734 --> 00:14:04,237
He's a wild, angry kid,
that's all he's ever been.
And you know why?

237
00:14:04,237 --> 00:14:08,742
Because he's been hit
on the head by somebody
once a day, every day.

238
00:14:08,742 --> 00:14:11,244
He's had a pretty
miserable 18 years.

239
00:14:11,745 --> 00:14:13,747
I just think we owe him
a few words, that's all.

240
00:14:13,747 --> 00:14:17,167
I don't mind telling
you this, mister.
We don't owe him a thing.

241
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:18,668
He got a fair trial,
didn't he?

242
00:14:18,668 --> 00:14:20,170
What do you think
that trial cost?

243
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:23,173
He's lucky he got it.
Know what I mean?

244
00:14:23,173 --> 00:14:26,176
Look, we're all
grown-ups in here.

245
00:14:26,176 --> 00:14:27,677
We heard the facts,
didn't we?

246
00:14:28,178 --> 00:14:30,180
You're not going to tell m
e that we're supposed
to believe this kid,

247
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,681
knowing what he is.

248
00:14:32,182 --> 00:14:34,184
.
Listen, I've lived
among them all my life

249
00:14:34,184 --> 00:14:36,186
You can't believe
a word they say.

250
00:14:36,186 --> 00:14:39,689
.
You know that.
I mean, they're born liars

251
00:14:39,689 --> 00:14:41,691
Only an ignorant man
can believe that.

252
00:14:42,192 --> 00:14:43,193
Now, listen...

253
00:14:43,193 --> 00:14:45,695
Do you think you were born
with a monopoly on the truth?

254
00:14:45,695 --> 00:14:48,698
I think certain things
should be pointed out
to this man.

255
00:14:48,698 --> 00:14:50,700
JUROR #7: Come on,
this isn't Sunday.
We don't need a sermon.

256
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,004
JUROR #1: Come on, we have
a job to do, now let's do it.

257
00:14:54,004 --> 00:14:58,258
Rice Pops. It's a product
I work on at the agency.

258
00:14:58,258 --> 00:15:01,761
"The breakfast with
the built-in bounce."
I wrote that line.

259
00:15:01,761 --> 00:15:02,762
Very catchy.

260
00:15:02,762 --> 00:15:04,764
Say, do you mind?

261
00:15:04,764 --> 00:15:06,516
Oh, I'm sorry.

262
00:15:06,516 --> 00:15:09,019
I have this habit of doodling.
It keeps me thinking clearly

263
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,521
We have all this work
to do. There's no poin
t staying here forever.

264
00:15:11,521 --> 00:15:12,522
I'm sorry.

265
00:15:12,522 --> 00:15:14,524
Okay.

266
00:15:14,524 --> 00:15:18,528
Now perhaps if
the gentleman down there
who's disagreeing with us,

267
00:15:18,528 --> 00:15:20,030
well, perhaps you
could tell us why.

268
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,032
You know, let us know
what you're thinking

269
00:15:22,032 --> 00:15:24,534
and we might be
able to show you
where you're mixed up.

270
00:15:24,534 --> 00:15:26,536
Well, look,
maybe this is an idea.

271
00:15:26,536 --> 00:15:28,038
Now, I haven't
given it much thought,

272
00:15:28,038 --> 00:15:31,541
but it seems to me that
it's up to the group of us
to convince this gentleman

273
00:15:32,042 --> 00:15:33,159
that he's wrong
and we're right.

274
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:37,163
Now, maybe if we each
took a couple of minutes
just to...

275
00:15:37,163 --> 00:15:38,665
Well, it was just
a quick idea.

276
00:15:38,665 --> 00:15:41,501
No, no, no.
That's a good one.

277
00:15:41,501 --> 00:15:43,587
JUROR #1: Supposing we go
once around the table?

278
00:15:43,587 --> 00:15:45,589
I guess you're first.

279
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,591
Well I...

280
00:15:49,593 --> 00:15:52,095
It's hard to put into words.

281
00:15:53,096 --> 00:15:55,098
I just think he's guilty.

282
00:15:55,098 --> 00:15:57,601
I thought it was obvious
from the word go.

283
00:15:58,101 --> 00:15:59,185
I mean,
nobody proved otherwise.

284
00:15:59,686 --> 00:16:03,189
Nobody has to prove otherwise.
The burden of proof's on
the prosecution.

285
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:07,193
.
The defendant doesn't even
have to open his mouth.
That's in the Constitution

286
00:16:07,193 --> 00:16:12,449
Oh, well, sure, I know that.
What I meant was, is...

287
00:16:12,782 --> 00:16:16,286
.
Well, I just think
he's guilty. I mean,
somebody saw him do it

288
00:16:16,286 --> 00:16:21,291
Okay. Here's what I think,
and I have no
personal feelings about this.

289
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,927
I just want to
talk about facts.

290
00:16:24,928 --> 00:16:27,430
Number one.

291
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:31,434
The old man lived downstairs
under the room where
the killing took place.

292
00:16:31,935 --> 00:16:35,438
At 12:10 on the night
of the killing,
he heard loud noises.

293
00:16:35,438 --> 00:16:37,440
Said it sounded like a fight.

294
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,443
And he heard
the kid yell out,
"I'm going to kill you."

295
00:16:40,443 --> 00:16:42,946
A second later,
he heard a body
hit the floor.

296
00:16:42,946 --> 00:16:44,447
Ran to the door,
opened it up,

297
00:16:44,948 --> 00:16:47,450
saw the kid running
down the stairs
and out of the house.

298
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:51,454
Called the police. They came
in and found the old man
with the knife in his chest.

299
00:16:51,454 --> 00:16:54,457
The coroner fixed
the time of death
around midnight.

300
00:16:54,457 --> 00:16:56,459
Now, these are facts.

301
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,963
You can't refute facts.
The kid is guilty.

302
00:17:00,463 --> 00:17:04,467
I'm just as sentimental
as the next fellow.
I know he's only 18.

303
00:17:04,467 --> 00:17:05,969
But he's still got to
pay for what he did.

304
00:17:05,969 --> 00:17:07,887
JUROR #7: I'm with you.

305
00:17:07,887 --> 00:17:10,390
JUROR #1: Okay.
Are you finished?

306
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,891
Yeah.
JUROR #1: Right. Next.

307
00:17:11,891 --> 00:17:15,395
It is obvious to me, anyway,
that the boy's entire story
was flimsy.

308
00:17:15,395 --> 00:17:17,397
He claimed he was
at the movies during
the time of the killing

309
00:17:17,397 --> 00:17:18,898
and yet one hour later,

310
00:17:19,399 --> 00:17:20,900
he couldn't remember
the names of the films he saw
or who played in them.

311
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,901
JUROR #3: That's right.

312
00:17:22,402 --> 00:17:24,237
And no one saw him
going in or out
of the theater.

313
00:17:24,738 --> 00:17:26,239
Listen, what about
the woman across
the street?

314
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:28,742
If her testimony
don't prove it,
nothing does.

315
00:17:28,742 --> 00:17:30,744
That's right. She was the one
who actually saw the killing.

316
00:17:31,244 --> 00:17:33,279
JUROR #1: Now, fellows,
please. Let's go in
order here, huh?

317
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:35,281
Just a minute.
Here's a woman...

318
00:17:35,281 --> 00:17:36,783
(COUGHING)

319
00:17:36,783 --> 00:17:38,284
Here's a woman
who's lying in bed.

320
00:17:38,284 --> 00:17:41,287
She can't sleep.
She's dying with the heat.
You know what I mean?

321
00:17:41,287 --> 00:17:44,290
Anyway she looks
out the window,
and right across the street

322
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:47,794
she sees the kid
stick the knife
into his father.

323
00:17:47,794 --> 00:17:51,297
The time is
12:10 on the nose.
Everything fits.

324
00:17:51,798 --> 00:17:53,800
Look, she's known
the kid all his life.

325
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,302
His window is
right opposite hers
across the El tracks,

326
00:17:56,302 --> 00:17:57,804
and she swore
she saw him do it.

327
00:17:57,804 --> 00:17:59,806
Through the windows
of a passing El train.

328
00:17:59,806 --> 00:18:02,525
Right. This El train
had no passengers on it.

329
00:18:02,525 --> 00:18:04,527
It was just being
moved downtown.

330
00:18:04,527 --> 00:18:06,529
The lights were out,
remember?

331
00:18:06,529 --> 00:18:08,031
And they proved
in court that at night

332
00:18:08,031 --> 00:18:10,533
you can look through
the windows of an El train
when the lights are out

333
00:18:10,533 --> 00:18:13,703
and see what's happening
on the other side.
They proved it.

334
00:18:13,703 --> 00:18:15,705
I'd like to ask
you something.

335
00:18:15,705 --> 00:18:18,208
You don't believe the boy'
s story. How come you believ
e the woman's?

336
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:21,161
She's one of them,
too, isn't she?

337
00:18:23,163 --> 00:18:24,881
You're a pretty
smart fellow, aren't you?

338
00:18:24,881 --> 00:18:26,382
JUROR #1: Okay, gentlemen.
Now, gentlemen.

339
00:18:26,883 --> 00:18:28,885
Come on, sit down.
Sit down.

340
00:18:28,885 --> 00:18:31,387
What's he so wise about?
I'm telling you...

341
00:18:31,387 --> 00:18:34,390
JUROR #1: Okay, now come on.
Now we're not going to get
anywhere fighting.

342
00:18:34,891 --> 00:18:35,892
Whose turn is it next?

343
00:18:35,892 --> 00:18:38,645
Oh, his.
Number five.

344
00:18:42,398 --> 00:18:44,901
Can I pass?

345
00:18:44,901 --> 00:18:47,403
JUROR #1: Well,
that's your privilege.

346
00:18:47,403 --> 00:18:49,739
How about the next gentleman?

347
00:18:49,739 --> 00:18:52,659
Oh. Well, I don't know.

348
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:57,664
I started to be convinced,
you know,
very early in the case.

349
00:18:57,664 --> 00:19:00,667
You see,
I was looking
for a motive.

350
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:03,670
That's very important
because if you
don't have a motive,

351
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,172
where's your case, right?

352
00:19:06,172 --> 00:19:08,675
Anyway, that testimony
from those people

353
00:19:09,175 --> 00:19:12,178
in the apartment
across the hall from
the kid's apartment,

354
00:19:12,178 --> 00:19:14,681
.
that was very powerful

355
00:19:14,681 --> 00:19:17,684
,
Didn't they say something
about a fight, an argument

356
00:19:17,684 --> 00:19:21,721
between the old man
and his son around
about 7:00 that night?

357
00:19:21,721 --> 00:19:23,723
I mean, I could be
wrong but...

358
00:19:23,723 --> 00:19:25,225
It was 8:00, not 7:00.
It was 8:00, that's right.

359
00:19:25,225 --> 00:19:28,228
They heard an argument.
They couldn't hear
what it was about.

360
00:19:28,728 --> 00:19:30,230
Then they heard the father
hit the boy twice.

361
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,232
(COUGHING)

362
00:19:32,232 --> 00:19:35,235
Finally they saw the boy run,
angry, out of the house.
What does that prove?

363
00:19:35,235 --> 00:19:37,237
It don't exactly
prove anything.

364
00:19:37,237 --> 00:19:38,738
.
It's just part
of the picture

365
00:19:38,738 --> 00:19:40,240
You said it
provided a motive.

366
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,741
The prosecuting attorney
said the same thing.

367
00:19:41,741 --> 00:19:44,244
I don't think
that was a very
strong motive.

368
00:19:44,244 --> 00:19:47,747
This boy has been hit so many
times in his life that
violence is practically...

369
00:19:47,747 --> 00:19:50,750
It's a normal state
of affairs with him.

370
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:55,054
I just can't see two slaps
in the face provoking him
into committing murder.

371
00:19:55,054 --> 00:19:58,925
It may have been two
too many. Everyone has
a breaking point.

372
00:20:00,927 --> 00:20:01,928
JUROR #1: Anything else?

373
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:04,430
(SIGHING) No.

374
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,933
JUROR #1: Okay. How about you?

375
00:20:09,435 --> 00:20:11,437
I don't know.
It's all been said.

376
00:20:12,939 --> 00:20:14,941
You can talk here forever.
It's still the same thing.

377
00:20:16,442 --> 00:20:18,444
This kid is 5 for 0.

378
00:20:19,445 --> 00:20:21,447
Well, look at his record.

379
00:20:21,447 --> 00:20:23,950
When he was 10,
he was in children's court.

380
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,451
He threw a rock at a teacher.

381
00:20:25,952 --> 00:20:27,954
When he was 15,
he was in reform school.

382
00:20:28,454 --> 00:20:29,956
He stole a car.

383
00:20:30,456 --> 00:20:32,458
He's been arrested
for mugging.

384
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:34,460
He was picked up
twice for knife fighting.

385
00:20:34,961 --> 00:20:37,463
They say he's real
handy with a knife.

386
00:20:37,964 --> 00:20:39,465
Oh, this is a very fine boy.

387
00:20:39,465 --> 00:20:42,969
Ever since he was five years
old, his father beat him up
regularly.

388
00:20:42,969 --> 00:20:44,470
He used his fists.

389
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,973
So would I.
A kid like that?

390
00:20:46,973 --> 00:20:50,276
It's these kids,
the way they are nowadays.

391
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:56,282
When I was a kid,
I used to call
my father "Sir".

392
00:20:56,783 --> 00:20:59,786
That's right, "Sir".
Do you ever hear a kid
call his father that anymore?

393
00:20:59,786 --> 00:21:02,288
JUROR #8: Fathers don't
seem to think it's
important anymore.

394
00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:04,290
You got any kids?

395
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,291
JUROR #8: Three.

396
00:21:06,793 --> 00:21:08,294
I got one.

397
00:21:09,796 --> 00:21:11,798
He's 22 years old.

398
00:21:17,303 --> 00:21:21,808
When he was nine years old
, he ran away from a fight.

399
00:21:21,808 --> 00:21:26,813
I saw it.
I was so embarrassed,
I almost threw up.

400
00:21:26,813 --> 00:21:31,818
I said, "I'm going to make
a man out of you if I have
to break you in two trying."

401
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,322
Well, I made
a man out of him.

402
00:21:36,823 --> 00:21:39,325
.
When he was 16
, we had a fight

403
00:21:40,326 --> 00:21:43,329
Hit me in the jaw.
He was a big kid.

404
00:21:46,332 --> 00:21:49,252
I haven't seen
him for two years.

405
00:21:50,253 --> 00:21:51,254
(SCOFFS)

406
00:21:51,254 --> 00:21:52,755
Kids.

407
00:21:54,257 --> 00:21:56,292
You work your heart out...

408
00:21:58,795 --> 00:22:00,179
Well, let's get going.

409
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:02,682
JUROR #4: I think we're
missing the point here.

410
00:22:02,682 --> 00:22:05,768
This boy, let's say he's
the product of a broken home
and a filthy neighborhood.

411
00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:07,270
We can't help that.

412
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,772
We're here to decide
whether he's
innocent or guilty.

413
00:22:09,772 --> 00:22:12,775
Not to go into the reasons
why he grew up the way he did.

414
00:22:12,775 --> 00:22:15,778
He was born in a slum.
Slums are breeding
grounds for criminals.

415
00:22:15,778 --> 00:22:17,780
I know it and so do you.

416
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:22,285
It's no secret that children
from slum backgrounds are
potential menaces to society.

417
00:22:22,285 --> 00:22:24,287
Now, I think...
Brother,
you can say that again.

418
00:22:24,787 --> 00:22:27,290
The kids who crawl
out of these places
are real trash.

419
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,791
I don't want
any part of them,
I'm telling you.

420
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:30,793
Listen, I...

421
00:22:30,793 --> 00:22:32,795
I've lived in
a slum all my life.

422
00:22:32,795 --> 00:22:34,297
JUROR #10: Wait a minute.
Please. I...

423
00:22:34,797 --> 00:22:37,300
I've played in backyards
that were filled with garbage.

424
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,801
Maybe you can
still smell it on me.

425
00:22:39,302 --> 00:22:40,303
JUROR #10: Now,
listen, sonny...

426
00:22:40,303 --> 00:22:41,637
JUROR #1: Come on, now.
There's nothing personal.

427
00:22:41,637 --> 00:22:43,506
.
No, there was
something personal

428
00:22:43,506 --> 00:22:46,509
Come on, fellow.
He didn't mean you.
Let's not be so sensitive.

429
00:22:46,509 --> 00:22:49,012
This sensitivity
I can understand.

430
00:22:49,012 --> 00:22:53,316
Okay, look.
Let's stop the arguing.
We're only wasting time.

431
00:22:55,018 --> 00:22:58,021
Your turn down there.
Let's go.

432
00:22:58,021 --> 00:23:00,523
I didn't expect a turn.
I thought you were all
going to try to convince me.

433
00:23:01,024 --> 00:23:02,025
Wasn't that the idea?

434
00:23:02,025 --> 00:23:03,026
JUROR #12: Check,
that was the idea.

435
00:23:03,026 --> 00:23:04,527
I forgot about that.
He's right.

436
00:23:05,028 --> 00:23:06,529
What difference does
it make? He's the one
who's keeping us in here.

437
00:23:06,529 --> 00:23:08,031
Let's hear what
he's got to say.

438
00:23:08,031 --> 00:23:10,033
Now, wait a minute.
We decided to do
this a certain way.

439
00:23:10,033 --> 00:23:11,534
I think we ought
to stick to that way.

440
00:23:11,534 --> 00:23:13,536
Oh, stop being a kid,
will you?

441
00:23:14,037 --> 00:23:15,038
What do you mean,
"a kid"?

442
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:17,540
.
What do you think
I mean? K-I-D, kid

443
00:23:21,544 --> 00:23:24,047
Listen, just because
I'm trying to keep
this thing organized?

444
00:23:24,047 --> 00:23:26,049
Here, you take it.
You take on
the responsibility.

445
00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:28,051
I'll just keep my
mouth shut, that's all.

446
00:23:28,551 --> 00:23:30,553
What are you
getting so hot about?
Calm down, will you?

447
00:23:30,553 --> 00:23:32,555
Don't tell me to calm down.
Here, you want to take
the chair?

448
00:23:33,056 --> 00:23:34,057
Just take the chair,
that's all.

449
00:23:34,524 --> 00:23:36,025
See if you can keep
it running.
Did you ever see such a thing?

450
00:23:36,526 --> 00:23:38,027
Listen, you think
it's funny or something?

451
00:23:38,027 --> 00:23:40,029
Hey, forget it, fellow.
The whole thing's
unimportant. Come on.

452
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:42,031
Unimportant? Well,
here, you try it.

453
00:23:42,031 --> 00:23:45,034
No. Nobody wants to change.
You're doing a beautiful job.
Sit down.

454
00:23:45,535 --> 00:23:51,040
JUROR #7: Yeah, you're doing
great. Just great, fellow.
You stay in there and pitch.

455
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,544
All right,
let's hear from somebody.

456
00:23:54,544 --> 00:23:59,048
JUROR #8: Well, if you want me
to tell you how I feel about
it, it's all right with me.

457
00:23:59,048 --> 00:24:01,050
Boy, I don't care
what you do.

458
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:03,753
All right. I don't
have anything brilliant.

459
00:24:03,753 --> 00:24:06,255
I only know as
much as you do.

460
00:24:06,255 --> 00:24:10,259
According to the testimony,
the boy looks guilty.
Maybe he is.

461
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:14,764
I sat there in court
for six days listening
while the evidence built up.

462
00:24:14,764 --> 00:24:16,766
Everybody sounded
so positive.

463
00:24:16,766 --> 00:24:19,268
I began to get a peculiar
feeling about this trial.

464
00:24:19,268 --> 00:24:22,271
I mean,
nothing is that positive.

465
00:24:22,271 --> 00:24:23,773
There are a lot of questions
I'd have liked to ask.

466
00:24:23,773 --> 00:24:26,776
I don't know,
maybe they wouldn't have
meant anything but...

467
00:24:26,776 --> 00:24:28,277
I began to get the feeling
that the defense counsel

468
00:24:28,277 --> 00:24:32,281
wasn't conducting a thorough
enough cross-examination.
I'm not...

469
00:24:32,281 --> 00:24:34,283
He let too many things go by.
Little things.

470
00:24:34,283 --> 00:24:35,701
?
What little things

471
00:24:35,701 --> 00:24:37,703
Listen, when these fellows
don't ask questions,

472
00:24:37,703 --> 00:24:40,423
it's because they know
the answers already and
they figure they'll be hurt.

473
00:24:40,423 --> 00:24:43,926
Maybe. It's also possible
for a lawyer to be just
plain stupid, isn't it?

474
00:24:44,427 --> 00:24:45,378
I mean, it's possible.

475
00:24:45,378 --> 00:24:47,380
You sound like you met
my brother-in-law once.

476
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,381
(CHUCKLES)

477
00:24:48,381 --> 00:24:49,882
(COUGHING)

478
00:24:50,383 --> 00:24:52,885
I kept putting myself
in the kid's place.

479
00:24:54,887 --> 00:24:56,889
I'd have asked for
another lawyer, I think.

480
00:24:56,889 --> 00:24:59,392
I mean, if I was on trial
for my life,

481
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:04,397
I'd want my lawyer to tear
the prosecution witnesses
to shreds, or at least try to.

482
00:25:04,397 --> 00:25:08,901
Look, there was one
alleged eyewitness
to this killing.

483
00:25:08,901 --> 00:25:12,405
Someone else claims he heard
the killing, saw the boy run
out afterwards,

484
00:25:12,405 --> 00:25:14,407
.
and there was a lot
of circumstantial evidence

485
00:25:14,907 --> 00:25:18,411
But actually those two
witnesses were the entire
case for the prosecution.

486
00:25:18,411 --> 00:25:20,329
Supposing they're wrong?

487
00:25:20,329 --> 00:25:21,831
What do you mean,
"Supposing they're wrong?"

488
00:25:22,331 --> 00:25:23,833
What's the point
of having witnesses at all?

489
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:25,835
Could they be wrong?

490
00:25:25,835 --> 00:25:28,337
What are you trying to say?
Those people sat on
the stand under oath.

491
00:25:28,337 --> 00:25:32,341
They're only people.
People make mistakes.
Could they be wrong?

492
00:25:32,341 --> 00:25:33,843
Well, no.
I don't think so.

493
00:25:33,843 --> 00:25:35,344
?
Do you know so

494
00:25:35,344 --> 00:25:37,346
Oh, come on,
nobody can know
a thing like that.

495
00:25:37,346 --> 00:25:39,065
This isn't an
exact science.

496
00:25:39,065 --> 00:25:41,484
That's right, it isn't.

497
00:25:45,821 --> 00:25:48,324
Okay, let's get
to the point.

498
00:25:48,324 --> 00:25:51,327
What about the switch knif
e they found in
the old man's chest?

499
00:25:51,327 --> 00:25:53,329
Wait a minute,
there's some people
who haven't talked yet.

500
00:25:53,329 --> 00:25:54,830
Shouldn't we
go in order?

501
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:57,833
They'll get a chance to talk.
Be quiet a second, will you?

502
00:25:57,833 --> 00:25:59,835
Well, what about it?

503
00:25:59,835 --> 00:26:03,172
The knife this fine,
upright boy admitted buyin
g the night of the killing?

504
00:26:03,172 --> 00:26:04,507
Let's talk about it.

505
00:26:04,507 --> 00:26:05,508
All right.
Let's talk about it.

506
00:26:05,508 --> 00:26:06,509
Let's get it in here
and look at it.

507
00:26:07,009 --> 00:26:08,594
I'd like to see it again.
Mr. Foreman?

508
00:26:08,594 --> 00:26:11,681
JUROR #3: We all saw what
it looks like. Why do we
have to see it again?

509
00:26:11,681 --> 00:26:15,685
JUROR #4: The gentleman
has a right to see
exhibits and evidence.

510
00:26:16,185 --> 00:26:17,687
Say, could you
bring us the knife
?
The knife?

511
00:26:17,687 --> 00:26:20,940
Yeah. Thank you.
Sure.

512
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:24,443
The knife and the way it
was bought is pretty strong
evidence, don't you think?

513
00:26:24,443 --> 00:26:25,945
I do.
Good.

514
00:26:25,945 --> 00:26:28,447
Now suppose we take
these facts one at a time.

515
00:26:28,447 --> 00:26:31,951
One, the boy admitted going
out of the house at 8:00
on the night of the murder

516
00:26:31,951 --> 00:26:33,953
after being slapped
several times by his father.

517
00:26:33,953 --> 00:26:36,455
No, no, no,
he didn't say "slapped."
He said "punched."

518
00:26:36,956 --> 00:26:39,458
.
There's a difference
between a slap and a punch

519
00:26:39,458 --> 00:26:41,961
After being hit
several times by his father.

520
00:26:41,961 --> 00:26:45,464
Two, he went directly to
a neighborhood junk shop where
he bought one of those...

521
00:26:45,464 --> 00:26:46,465
Switch knives.

522
00:26:46,966 --> 00:26:48,467
Switchblade knives.

523
00:26:48,467 --> 00:26:50,469
This wasn't what you'd
call an ordinary knife.

524
00:26:50,469 --> 00:26:53,472
It had a very unusual
carved handle and blade.

525
00:26:53,472 --> 00:26:54,974
The storekeeper
who sold it to him

526
00:26:54,974 --> 00:26:57,977
said it was the only one
of its kind he had ever
had in stock.

527
00:26:57,977 --> 00:27:01,981
Three, he met some friends
of his in front of a tavern
about 8:45.

528
00:27:01,981 --> 00:27:02,982
Am I right so far?

529
00:27:02,982 --> 00:27:03,983
Yes, you are.

530
00:27:04,483 --> 00:27:05,985
You bet he is.

531
00:27:05,985 --> 00:27:08,988
He talked with his friends
for about an hour,
leaving them at 9:45.

532
00:27:08,988 --> 00:27:11,991
During this time,
they saw the switch knife.

533
00:27:11,991 --> 00:27:18,914
Four, they identified
the death weapon in court
as that very same knife.

534
00:27:18,914 --> 00:27:21,417
Five, he arrived
home at about 10:00.

535
00:27:21,417 --> 00:27:23,919
Now, this is where
the stories offered
by the State and the boy

536
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,921
begin to diverge slightly.

537
00:27:25,921 --> 00:27:28,924
He claims that he went
to a movie at about 11:30,

538
00:27:28,924 --> 00:27:32,928
returning home at 3:10
to find his father dead
and himself arrested.

539
00:27:32,928 --> 00:27:34,930
JUROR #8: He also claims
that the two detectives
who arrested him

540
00:27:35,431 --> 00:27:37,433
threw him down
a half a flight of stairs.

541
00:27:37,433 --> 00:27:39,435
Now, what happened
to the switch knife?

542
00:27:39,435 --> 00:27:41,937
He claims that it fell
through a hole in his pocket
on the way to the movie,

543
00:27:41,937 --> 00:27:44,940
sometime between
11:30 and 3:10,

544
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,942
and that he
never saw it again.

545
00:27:46,942 --> 00:27:48,944
Now, there is a tale,
gentlemen.

546
00:27:48,944 --> 00:27:52,448
I think it's quite clear
that the boy never went
to the movies that night.

547
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:54,450
No one in the house
saw him go out at 11:30.

548
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:55,951
No one at the theater
identified him.

549
00:27:55,951 --> 00:27:57,953
He couldn't even remember
the names of the pictures
he saw.

550
00:27:58,454 --> 00:27:59,455
(DOOR OPENING)

551
00:28:00,956 --> 00:28:02,742
What actually
happened is this.

552
00:28:02,742 --> 00:28:06,162
The boy stayed home,
had another fight
with his father,

553
00:28:06,162 --> 00:28:10,166
stabbed him to death
and left the house at 12:10.

554
00:28:10,166 --> 00:28:12,668
He even remembered
to wipe the knife
clean of fingerprints.

555
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:17,089
Now are you trying to tell me
that this knife
really fell through a hole

556
00:28:17,089 --> 00:28:19,091
in the boy's pocket,
someone picked it
up off the street,

557
00:28:19,091 --> 00:28:22,595
went to the boy's house
and stabbed his father with it
just to test its sharpness?

558
00:28:22,595 --> 00:28:25,097
No, I'm just saying
it's possible
the boy lost his knife

559
00:28:25,097 --> 00:28:27,099
and that somebody else
stabbed his father
with a similar knife.

560
00:28:27,099 --> 00:28:28,601
.
It's just possible

561
00:28:28,601 --> 00:28:30,152
Take a look at this knife.

562
00:28:32,154 --> 00:28:36,158
It's a very unusual knife.
I've never seen one like it.

563
00:28:36,158 --> 00:28:38,661
Neither had the storekeeper
who sold it to the boy.

564
00:28:38,661 --> 00:28:41,831
Aren't you asking us
to accept a pretty
incredible coincidence?

565
00:28:41,831 --> 00:28:43,833
I'm just saying
a coincidence is possible.

566
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,335
And I say
it's not possible.

567
00:28:52,425 --> 00:28:53,876
Where did
that come from?

568
00:28:53,876 --> 00:28:55,378
It's the same knife!

569
00:28:55,378 --> 00:28:57,380
What do you
think you're doing?

570
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,798
Where did you get it?

571
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:01,300
I went out walking
for a couple of hours
last night.

572
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,302
I walked through
the boy's neighborhood.

573
00:29:03,302 --> 00:29:06,806
I bought that at a little
pawn shop just two blocks
from the boy's house.

574
00:29:06,806 --> 00:29:08,474
It cost $6.

575
00:29:08,974 --> 00:29:11,193
It's against the law
to buy or sell
switchblade knives.

576
00:29:11,694 --> 00:29:13,062
That's right.
I broke the law.

577
00:29:13,062 --> 00:29:15,030
Listen, you pulled
a real bright trick.

578
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:17,533
Now supposing you
tell me what it proves.

579
00:29:17,533 --> 00:29:19,618
Maybe there are 10
knives like that.
So what?

580
00:29:19,618 --> 00:29:20,953
Maybe there are!

581
00:29:20,953 --> 00:29:22,455
What does it mean?

582
00:29:22,455 --> 00:29:24,457
You found another knife
like it. What's that?

583
00:29:24,457 --> 00:29:26,041
The discovery of
the age or something?

584
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:28,544
You mean you're asking us
to believe that somebody else
did the stabbing

585
00:29:28,544 --> 00:29:29,879
?
with exactly
the same kind of knife

586
00:29:30,329 --> 00:29:31,664
The odds are a million-to-one.

587
00:29:31,664 --> 00:29:32,998
It's possible!

588
00:29:32,998 --> 00:29:34,917
But not very probable.

589
00:29:35,418 --> 00:29:37,253
JUROR #1: Okay, fellows.
Let's take our seats.

590
00:29:37,253 --> 00:29:41,173
There's no point
standing around
all over the place.

591
00:29:41,173 --> 00:29:43,175
You know,
it's interesting
that he'd find a knife

592
00:29:43,175 --> 00:29:44,677
exactly like the one
the boy bought.

593
00:29:44,677 --> 00:29:47,680
What's interesting
about it? Interesting!

594
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,682
Well, I don't know,
I just thought it
was interesting.

595
00:29:49,682 --> 00:29:52,017
.
There are still 11 of us
here who think he's guilty

596
00:29:52,017 --> 00:29:53,519
JUROR #10: Right.
What do you think you're
going to accomplish?

597
00:29:54,019 --> 00:29:55,521
You're not going
to change anybody's mind.

598
00:29:55,521 --> 00:29:58,023
So if you want to be stubborn
and hang this jury, go ahead.

599
00:29:58,524 --> 00:30:01,527
The kid will be tried
again and found guilty
, sure as he's born.

600
00:30:03,028 --> 00:30:05,030
You're probably right.

601
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:08,033
So, what are you going to do?
We could be here all night.

602
00:30:08,033 --> 00:30:11,537
JUROR #9: It's only one night.
A boy may die.

603
00:30:11,537 --> 00:30:14,039
Well, why don't we
just set up house here?

604
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:16,542
Someone send for
Potsy the policeman
to get a pinochle deck

605
00:30:16,542 --> 00:30:19,345
and we'll just sweat
the whole thing out
right here.

606
00:30:19,345 --> 00:30:20,546
(LAUGHING)

607
00:30:20,546 --> 00:30:23,048
I don't think he
ought to joke about it.

608
00:30:23,048 --> 00:30:24,550
What do you want
me to do about it?

609
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:27,553
Listen, I don't see what all
this stuff about the knife
has got to do with anything.

610
00:30:27,553 --> 00:30:30,556
Somebody saw the kid
stab his father.
What more do we need?

611
00:30:30,556 --> 00:30:33,559
You guys can talk the ears
right off my head,
you know what I mean?

612
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:36,061
I got three garages of mine
going to pot
while you're talking.

613
00:30:36,061 --> 00:30:38,063
So let's get done
and get out of here.

614
00:30:38,063 --> 00:30:41,567
The knife was very important
to the district attorney.
He spent a whole day...

615
00:30:41,567 --> 00:30:44,069
He's a 15th assistant
or something.
What does he know about it?

616
00:30:44,069 --> 00:30:45,571
JUROR #1: Hey,
let's hold it down.

617
00:30:45,571 --> 00:30:48,073
These side arguments
are only slowing us up.

618
00:30:50,626 --> 00:30:53,629
JUROR #1: Well, what about it?
You're the only one.

619
00:31:01,637 --> 00:31:04,640
I have a proposition
to make to all of you.

620
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,643
I'm going to call
for another vote.

621
00:31:07,643 --> 00:31:13,766
I want you 11 men to vote
by secret written ballot.

622
00:31:13,766 --> 00:31:18,354
I'll abstain. If there
are 11 votes for guilty,
I won't stand alone.

623
00:31:18,354 --> 00:31:23,609
.
We'll take in
a guilty verdict
to the judge right now

624
00:31:23,609 --> 00:31:25,611
But if anyone
votes not guilty,

625
00:31:25,611 --> 00:31:28,113
we stay here
and talk it out.

626
00:31:30,616 --> 00:31:33,118
That's it. If you want
to try it, I'm ready.

627
00:31:33,118 --> 00:31:35,037
JUROR #7: All right.
Let's do it the hard way.

628
00:31:35,538 --> 00:31:38,541
That sounds fair.
Everyone agreed?
Anyone doesn't agree?

629
00:31:38,541 --> 00:31:40,376
Fine, let's go.
Pass these along.

630
00:32:14,293 --> 00:32:16,295
"Guilty."

631
00:32:18,297 --> 00:32:19,798
"Guilty."

632
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,302
"Guilty."

633
00:32:25,304 --> 00:32:26,805
"Guilty."

634
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,341
"Guilty."

635
00:32:30,843 --> 00:32:32,728
"Guilty."

636
00:32:34,063 --> 00:32:35,564
"Guilty."

637
00:32:36,565 --> 00:32:37,566
"Guilty."

638
00:32:39,068 --> 00:32:40,569
"Guilty."

639
00:32:44,657 --> 00:32:46,659
"Not guilty."

640
00:32:46,659 --> 00:32:48,160
JUROR #1: "Guilty."

641
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,162
Boy, how do you like that?

642
00:32:50,162 --> 00:32:52,164
And another chap
flips his wings!

643
00:32:52,665 --> 00:32:55,668
All right. Who was it?
Come on, I want to know.

644
00:32:55,668 --> 00:32:59,171
Excuse me.
This was a secret ballot.
We all agreed on that, no?

645
00:32:59,672 --> 00:33:01,674
If the gentleman
wants it to remain secret...

646
00:33:01,924 --> 00:33:03,258
Secret? What do you mean,
"secret"?

647
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:06,261
There are no secrets
in a jury room.
I know who it was.

648
00:33:07,763 --> 00:33:09,264
Brother, you really
are something.

649
00:33:09,765 --> 00:33:11,767
You sit here, vote guilty
like the rest of us,

650
00:33:11,767 --> 00:33:15,270
then some golden-voiced
preacher starts tearing
your poor heart out

651
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,772
about some
underprivileged kid

652
00:33:16,772 --> 00:33:20,275
just couldn't help
becoming a murderer
and you change your vote.

653
00:33:20,275 --> 00:33:22,277
If that isn't
the most sickening...

654
00:33:22,277 --> 00:33:25,781
Why don't you drop a quarter
in his collection box?

655
00:33:25,781 --> 00:33:29,568
Oh, now just wait a...
Listen, you can't
talk to me like that.

656
00:33:30,069 --> 00:33:31,070
Who do you
think you are?

657
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,121
Calm down, calm down.

658
00:33:32,121 --> 00:33:33,622
JUROR #5: Who does
he think he is?
It doesn't matter.

659
00:33:33,622 --> 00:33:35,040
He's very excitable.
Sit down.

660
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,042
"Excitable"?
You bet I'm excitable!

661
00:33:37,042 --> 00:33:40,329
We're trying to put
a guilty man in the chair,
where he belongs.

662
00:33:40,329 --> 00:33:43,215
Someone starts
telling us fairytales
and we're listening!

663
00:33:43,215 --> 00:33:44,883
JUROR #1: Hey, come on.

664
00:33:45,384 --> 00:33:47,219
What made you
change your vote?

665
00:33:47,219 --> 00:33:49,555
He didn't change his vote.
I did.

666
00:33:50,055 --> 00:33:52,091
JUROR #10: Oh, fine.
JUROR #7: I knew it.

667
00:33:52,091 --> 00:33:54,143
Would you like me
to tell you why?

668
00:33:54,143 --> 00:33:56,095
No, I wouldn't
like you to tell me why.

669
00:33:56,095 --> 00:33:58,597
Well, I'd like to
make it clear anyway,
if you don't mind.

670
00:33:58,597 --> 00:34:00,099
?
Do we have to
listen to this

671
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:02,101
The man
wants to talk.

672
00:34:02,101 --> 00:34:03,602
Thank you.

673
00:34:03,602 --> 00:34:07,106
This gentleman has been
standing alone against us.

674
00:34:07,106 --> 00:34:09,608
Now he doesn't say
the boy is not guilty.

675
00:34:09,608 --> 00:34:11,610
.
He just isn't sure

676
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:14,613
It's not easy to stand
alone against the ridicule
of others.

677
00:34:14,613 --> 00:34:19,618
So he gambled for support,
and I gave it to him.
I respect his motives.

678
00:34:19,618 --> 00:34:24,123
The boy on trial
is probably guilty,
but I want to hear more.

679
00:34:24,123 --> 00:34:26,125
Right now,
the vote is 10-2.

680
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:28,260
!
I'm talking here!
You have no right
to leave this room

681
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:31,764
He can't hear you.
He never will.
Let's sit down.

682
00:34:36,552 --> 00:34:38,554
Shall we
continue?

683
00:34:38,554 --> 00:34:40,556
Well, I think we
ought to take a break.

684
00:34:40,556 --> 00:34:44,059
You know, one man's inside
and I think we
ought to wait for him.

685
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:50,983
Looks like we're
really hung up here, huh?

686
00:34:50,983 --> 00:34:55,487
I mean,
that thing with the old man,
that was pretty unexpected.

687
00:34:55,487 --> 00:34:58,490
Wish I could figure out
some way we could break it up.

688
00:34:59,992 --> 00:35:00,993
(CHUCKLES)

689
00:35:00,993 --> 00:35:02,995
You know,
in advertising...

690
00:35:02,995 --> 00:35:04,496
I told you I worke
d in an agency?

691
00:35:04,496 --> 00:35:05,998
Mmm-hmm.

692
00:35:05,998 --> 00:35:07,499
You know, there's
some pretty strange
people working there.

693
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,501
Well, they're not strange,
really.

694
00:35:09,501 --> 00:35:12,504
I guess it's just
they have peculiar ways
of expressing themselves.

695
00:35:12,504 --> 00:35:14,006
You know
what I mean.

696
00:35:14,506 --> 00:35:17,009
Well, of course,
I suppose it's the same
in your business too, huh?

697
00:35:17,009 --> 00:35:18,510
What do you do?

698
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,012
I'm a watchmaker.

699
00:35:20,012 --> 00:35:24,016
Really? I imagine the finest
watchmakers in the world come
from Europe.

700
00:35:24,016 --> 00:35:27,019
Well, anyway, as I was telling
you, in an agency, when we
reach a point like this...

701
00:35:27,019 --> 00:35:31,023
I'm telling him about in an
ad agency when a point like
this is reached in a meeting,

702
00:35:31,023 --> 00:35:34,026
there's always some character
ready with an idea, see.

703
00:35:34,026 --> 00:35:36,445
And it kills me.
It's the weirdest
thing in the world

704
00:35:36,445 --> 00:35:40,449
the way they sometimes
precede their idea
with a phrase, see, like,

705
00:35:40,449 --> 00:35:43,452
some account exec
will get up and he'll say,

706
00:35:43,452 --> 00:35:46,955
"Okay, here's an idea. Let's

707
00:35:46,955 --> 00:35:49,958
"run it up the flagpole
and see if anyone salutes it."

708
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:52,344
I mean, it's idiotic,
but it's funny.

709
00:35:52,344 --> 00:35:55,848
Hey, I got a little
excited back there.

710
00:35:56,348 --> 00:36:00,352
I didn't mean
to get nasty.

711
00:36:00,853 --> 00:36:04,356
Glad you're not one of those
who lets these emotional
appeals influence him.

712
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:23,742
I don't know what's
the matter with that fan.
Can't seem to get it started.

713
00:36:25,244 --> 00:36:26,745
(SCATTING)

714
00:36:33,252 --> 00:36:35,254
Are you a salesman?

715
00:36:35,754 --> 00:36:37,256
I'm an architect.

716
00:36:39,758 --> 00:36:41,260
You know what
the soft sell is?

717
00:36:44,763 --> 00:36:46,765
Well, you've got it,
believe me.

718
00:36:48,267 --> 00:36:50,269
I've got
a different technique.

719
00:36:50,769 --> 00:36:54,773
Laughs, drinks, jokes,
tricks. You know?

720
00:36:55,774 --> 00:36:58,277
Yeah.

721
00:36:58,277 --> 00:37:01,780
"Hit them where they live,
" that's my motto.

722
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:05,284
I made 27 grand last year
selling marmalade.

723
00:37:05,284 --> 00:37:08,787
That's not bad.
I mean, you know,
considering marmalade.

724
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:15,210
What are you getting
out of this? Kicks?

725
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:18,714
?
Or did somebody bump you
on the head one time and
you haven't gotten over it

726
00:37:18,714 --> 00:37:20,716
Maybe.

727
00:37:20,716 --> 00:37:23,218
You know, you do-gooders
are all alike.

728
00:37:23,218 --> 00:37:26,722
You're always blowing
your stacks over some
guy that fanned.

729
00:37:28,724 --> 00:37:31,727
But what are you
wasting our time for?

730
00:37:31,727 --> 00:37:36,231
Why don't you donate $5
to the cause and maybe
it'll make you feel better.

731
00:37:39,234 --> 00:37:41,236
This kid is guilty, pal.

732
00:37:41,737 --> 00:37:43,739
It's as plain as
the nose on your face.

733
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:46,241
So why don't we stop
wasting our time here?

734
00:37:46,241 --> 00:37:48,744
We're going to all get
sore throats if we keep it up.

735
00:37:49,244 --> 00:37:51,246
What difference does it make
if you get it here
or at the ball game?

736
00:37:52,748 --> 00:37:54,750
No difference, pal.

737
00:37:55,751 --> 00:37:57,753
No difference at all.

738
00:37:59,254 --> 00:38:00,255
(WHISTLING)

739
00:38:09,264 --> 00:38:10,766
Nice bunch of guys
, huh?

740
00:38:11,266 --> 00:38:13,185
They're about
the same as anyone else.

741
00:38:13,185 --> 00:38:14,186
(SIGHING)

742
00:38:14,186 --> 00:38:17,689
Boy,
what a murderous day.

743
00:38:17,689 --> 00:38:19,191
Do you think
we'll be much longer?

744
00:38:19,191 --> 00:38:21,193
I don't know.

745
00:38:21,193 --> 00:38:25,697
He's guilty for sure.
Not a doubt in
the whole world.

746
00:38:26,198 --> 00:38:27,699
We should've
been done already.

747
00:38:29,701 --> 00:38:30,702
Oh, I don't mind,
you know.

748
00:38:30,702 --> 00:38:32,204
(CHUCKLES)

749
00:38:32,204 --> 00:38:34,206
Beats working.

750
00:38:36,708 --> 00:38:38,210
Uh...

751
00:38:40,712 --> 00:38:42,714
You think he's
not guilty, huh?

752
00:38:42,714 --> 00:38:45,217
I don't know.
It's possible.

753
00:38:45,217 --> 00:38:49,221
Well, I don't know you,
but I'm betting you've never
been wronger in your life.

754
00:38:49,221 --> 00:38:51,723
You're wasting your time.
You ought to wrap it up.

755
00:38:51,723 --> 00:38:54,726
Supposing you were the one
that was on trial?

756
00:38:54,726 --> 00:38:58,230
Well, I'm not used
to supposing. I'm just
a working man.

757
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:01,233
My boss does
the supposing.

758
00:39:01,233 --> 00:39:03,735
But I'll try one.

759
00:39:03,735 --> 00:39:07,239
Supposing you talk
us all out of this

760
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:09,741
and the kid really did
knife his father, huh?

761
00:39:18,633 --> 00:39:20,635
Are you ready?

762
00:39:22,137 --> 00:39:24,139
Sorry, blue eyes.

763
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:25,640
Well, where else?

764
00:39:26,141 --> 00:39:28,143
JUROR #1: Okay, fellows.
Let's take our seats.

765
00:39:28,143 --> 00:39:30,145
Looks like we'll be
here for dinner, huh?

766
00:39:30,145 --> 00:39:32,147
Okay, now let's
get down to business.

767
00:39:32,647 --> 00:39:33,648
Now who wants
to start it off?

768
00:39:33,648 --> 00:39:34,649
I will.

769
00:39:34,649 --> 00:39:35,650
Okay, go.

770
00:39:36,151 --> 00:39:37,652
You, down there.

771
00:39:37,652 --> 00:39:39,654
The old man who
lived downstairs says

772
00:39:39,654 --> 00:39:41,656
he heard the kid yell out,
"I'm going to kill you."

773
00:39:41,656 --> 00:39:44,159
A second later,
he heard the body
hit the floor.

774
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:46,161
Now he ran to
the door and he saw

775
00:39:46,661 --> 00:39:48,163
the kid running down
the stairs and out
of the house.

776
00:39:48,163 --> 00:39:49,664
What does that mean to you?

777
00:39:49,664 --> 00:39:51,666
I was wondering how
clearly the old man

778
00:39:51,666 --> 00:39:53,168
could have heard
the boy's voice
through the ceiling.

779
00:39:53,668 --> 00:39:55,170
He didn't hear it
through the ceiling.
The window was open.

780
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:57,172
So was the one upstairs.
It was a hot night, remember?

781
00:39:57,672 --> 00:40:00,175
It was another apartment.
It's not that easy
to identify a voice,

782
00:40:00,175 --> 00:40:01,176
particularly
a shouting voice.

783
00:40:01,176 --> 00:40:03,178
JUROR #12:
He identified it in court.

784
00:40:03,178 --> 00:40:05,180
JUROR #3: That's right,
and don't forget
the lady across the street,

785
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,681
she looked right
in the open window

786
00:40:06,681 --> 00:40:08,683
and saw the boy stab
his father. Isn't that
enough for you?

787
00:40:08,683 --> 00:40:10,185
No, it isn't.

788
00:40:10,185 --> 00:40:12,187
Boy, how do you
like this guy?

789
00:40:12,187 --> 00:40:13,688
It's like talking
into a dead phone.

790
00:40:14,189 --> 00:40:15,690
JUROR #4: She said she
saw the killing through

791
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:17,192
the windows of
a moving elevated train.

792
00:40:17,192 --> 00:40:20,612
There were six cars on
the train. She saw the killing
through the last two cars.

793
00:40:21,113 --> 00:40:22,614
She remembered the most
insignificant details.

794
00:40:22,614 --> 00:40:24,616
I don't see how you
can argue with that.

795
00:40:24,616 --> 00:40:29,905
Has anybody here any idea
how long it would take
an el...

796
00:40:39,798 --> 00:40:42,050
This isn't a game.

797
00:40:45,337 --> 00:40:47,756
Did you see him?

798
00:40:47,756 --> 00:40:49,758
The nerve!
JUROR #1: All right.
Listen to me.

799
00:40:49,758 --> 00:40:50,759
The absolute nerve!

800
00:40:51,259 --> 00:40:52,761
All right. Forget it.
It's not important.

801
00:40:52,761 --> 00:40:54,763
"This isn't a game"?

802
00:40:54,763 --> 00:40:57,315
Who does he think he is?

803
00:40:57,315 --> 00:40:58,316
JUROR #1: Forget it now.

804
00:40:58,316 --> 00:41:01,319
Has anybody any idea
how long it takes

805
00:41:01,319 --> 00:41:04,072
an elevated train
going at medium speed
to pass a given point?

806
00:41:04,072 --> 00:41:05,574
.
What has that to do
with anything?
How long? Take a guess

807
00:41:06,074 --> 00:41:07,075
I wouldn't have
the slightest idea.

808
00:41:07,075 --> 00:41:08,577
What do you think?

809
00:41:08,577 --> 00:41:11,079
I don't know,
maybe 10, 12 seconds?

810
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,081
I think that's
a pretty good guess.
Anyone else?

811
00:41:13,081 --> 00:41:14,082
JUROR #11:
That sounds right to me.

812
00:41:14,583 --> 00:41:16,084
JUROR #10: Come on.
What's the guessing game for?

813
00:41:16,084 --> 00:41:18,086
What do you say?
Ten seconds
is about right.

814
00:41:18,086 --> 00:41:20,088
All right. Say 10 seconds.
What are you getting at?

815
00:41:20,088 --> 00:41:25,093
This. It takes a six-car
El train 10 seconds to pas
s a given point.

816
00:41:25,093 --> 00:41:26,595
Now, let's say
the given point

817
00:41:26,595 --> 00:41:29,598
.
is the open window
of the room where
the killing took place

818
00:41:29,598 --> 00:41:32,601
You can reach out of that
window and almost touch
the El tracks, right?

819
00:41:33,101 --> 00:41:36,605
Now let me ask you this.
Has anyone here ever
lived near the El tracks?

820
00:41:36,605 --> 00:41:40,609
.
Well, I just finished
painting an apartment
that overlooked an El line

821
00:41:40,609 --> 00:41:42,110
.
I was there
for three days

822
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:44,112
What was it like? Noisy?
What do you mean?
Oh, brother!

823
00:41:44,112 --> 00:41:46,114
No matter, though.
We were punchy.

824
00:41:46,114 --> 00:41:48,617
I lived in a second floor
apartment near the El line
once.

825
00:41:48,617 --> 00:41:51,620
When the window's open and
the train goes by, the noise
is almost unbearable.

826
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,121
You can hardly
hear yourself think.

827
00:41:53,121 --> 00:41:54,623
JUROR #3: All right, you can't
hear yourself think.

828
00:41:54,623 --> 00:41:55,624
Will you get to the point?

829
00:41:55,624 --> 00:41:57,542
I will, now just a minute.

830
00:41:57,542 --> 00:42:01,046
Let's take two pieces
of testimony and try
to put them together.

831
00:42:01,046 --> 00:42:05,550
First, the old man
in the apartment downstairs.

832
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:07,552
He says he heard the boy say,
"I'm going to kill you,"

833
00:42:08,053 --> 00:42:10,555
.
and a split-second later
heard a body hit the floor

834
00:42:10,555 --> 00:42:12,557
One second later,
right?
JUROR #2: That's right.

835
00:42:12,557 --> 00:42:16,561
Second, the woman
across the street
swore positively

836
00:42:16,561 --> 00:42:19,564
she looked out of the window
and saw the killing

837
00:42:19,564 --> 00:42:22,067
through the last two cars
of a passing
elevated train, right?

838
00:42:22,067 --> 00:42:23,068
The last two cars.

839
00:42:23,568 --> 00:42:24,069
JUROR #3: Well,
what are you giving us here?

840
00:42:24,569 --> 00:42:26,071
Now, just a minute.

841
00:42:26,071 --> 00:42:31,076
We've agreed that it takes
10 seconds for a train
to pass a given point.

842
00:42:31,076 --> 00:42:34,579
Since the woman saw
the killing through
the last two cars,

843
00:42:34,579 --> 00:42:39,584
we can assume that the bod
y hit the floor just as
the train went by.

844
00:42:40,085 --> 00:42:44,089
Therefore, the train
had been roaring by
the old man's window

845
00:42:44,089 --> 00:42:47,592
a full 10 seconds
before the body
hit the floor.

846
00:42:47,592 --> 00:42:49,594
The old man,
according to
his own testimony,

847
00:42:50,095 --> 00:42:53,098
"I'm going to kill you,"
body hitting the floor
a split-second later,

848
00:42:53,098 --> 00:42:55,600
t
would have had to hear
the boy make this statemen

849
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,469
with the El roaring
past his nose!

850
00:42:57,469 --> 00:42:58,720
It's not possible he
could have heard it.

851
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,222
That's idiotic,
of course he heard it.

852
00:43:00,222 --> 00:43:01,723
You think he
could have heard it?

853
00:43:02,224 --> 00:43:03,725
He said he yelled at
the top of his voice,
that's good enough for me...

854
00:43:03,725 --> 00:43:05,227
Even if he heard something
, he still couldn't have

855
00:43:05,227 --> 00:43:06,728
.
identified the voice
with the El roaring by

856
00:43:07,229 --> 00:43:09,981
You're talking about
a matter of seconds!
Nobody can be that accurate.

857
00:43:10,482 --> 00:43:12,984
Well, I think testimony
that could put a boy
into the electric chair

858
00:43:12,984 --> 00:43:16,238
should be that accurate.

859
00:43:16,238 --> 00:43:18,740
Can I tell you something?
I don't think he
could have heard it.

860
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:20,709
Maybe he didn't hear it.
I mean, with all that
El noise.

861
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:22,661
JUROR #3: What are you
people talking about?

862
00:43:23,161 --> 00:43:25,247
JUROR #5: Well, it stands
to reason he couldn't
have heard it.

863
00:43:25,247 --> 00:43:27,749
Why should he lie?
What's he got to gain?

864
00:43:27,749 --> 00:43:29,634
Attention, maybe.

865
00:43:29,634 --> 00:43:31,586
You keep coming in
with these bright sayings.

866
00:43:31,586 --> 00:43:34,723
Why don't you send
them in to a paper?
They pay $3 apiece!

867
00:43:34,723 --> 00:43:37,726
What are you talking
to him like that for?

868
00:43:37,726 --> 00:43:41,229
A guy talks like that to a
n old man really ought to ge
t stepped on, you know.

869
00:43:41,229 --> 00:43:44,232
You ought to have
more respect, mister.

870
00:43:44,232 --> 00:43:49,237
You say stuff like tha
t to him again, I'm goin
g to lay you out.

871
00:43:58,747 --> 00:44:02,284
Now you go ahead.
You say anything you like.

872
00:44:02,784 --> 00:44:05,787
Why do you think
the old man might lie?

873
00:44:05,787 --> 00:44:09,791
It was just that I looked
at him for a very long time.

874
00:44:09,791 --> 00:44:13,295
The seam of his jacket
was split, under the shoulder.

875
00:44:13,295 --> 00:44:17,299
Did you notice that?
I mean, to come to court
like that.

876
00:44:17,299 --> 00:44:18,800
(JUROR #10 COUGHING)

877
00:44:20,302 --> 00:44:24,306
He was a very old man
in a torn jacket,

878
00:44:24,306 --> 00:44:27,809
and he walked very
slowly to the stand.

879
00:44:27,809 --> 00:44:31,813
He was dragging his left leg
and trying to hide it

880
00:44:31,813 --> 00:44:34,816
.
because he was ashamed

881
00:44:34,816 --> 00:44:38,820
I think I know this man
better than anyone here.

882
00:44:39,321 --> 00:44:41,823
This is a quiet, frightened,

883
00:44:41,823 --> 00:44:44,326
insignificant old man

884
00:44:44,826 --> 00:44:47,329
who has been
nothing all his life.

885
00:44:47,329 --> 00:44:52,334
Who has never had recognition
or his name in the newspapers.

886
00:44:52,334 --> 00:44:56,838
Nobody knows him.
Nobody quotes him.

887
00:44:56,838 --> 00:45:01,343
Nobody seeks his advice
after 75 years.

888
00:45:01,343 --> 00:45:05,764
Gentlemen,
that's a very sad thing,
to mean nothing.

889
00:45:06,264 --> 00:45:10,769
A man like this
needs to be quoted,
to be listened to.

890
00:45:11,269 --> 00:45:15,273
To be quoted just once,
very important to him.

891
00:45:15,774 --> 00:45:18,276
It would be so hard for him
to recede into the background.

892
00:45:18,777 --> 00:45:19,778
JUROR #7: Wait a minute.
What are you trying to do?

893
00:45:19,778 --> 00:45:22,280
Tell us he'd lie
just so he could
be important once?

894
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,283
No. He wouldn't really lie.

895
00:45:25,283 --> 00:45:28,787
But perhaps he made himself
believe he heard those words

896
00:45:28,787 --> 00:45:31,423
and recognized
the boy's face.

897
00:45:31,423 --> 00:45:33,925
That's the most fantastic
story I've ever heard.

898
00:45:33,925 --> 00:45:36,878
How can you make up
a thing like that?
What do you know about it?

899
00:45:46,721 --> 00:45:47,889
Does anybody
want a cough drop?

900
00:45:47,889 --> 00:45:49,891
No, thanks.
JUROR #8: I'll take one.

901
00:45:49,891 --> 00:45:51,393
JUROR #12: You can
say what you like,

902
00:45:51,393 --> 00:45:53,945
but I still don't see
how anybody can
think he's not guilty.

903
00:45:53,945 --> 00:45:56,448
There's something else
I'd like to talk about
for a minute.

904
00:45:56,448 --> 00:45:57,949
Thanks.

905
00:45:57,949 --> 00:45:59,951
I think we've proved that
the old man couldn't have
heard the boy say,

906
00:46:00,452 --> 00:46:01,953
"I'm going to kill you."
But supposing...

907
00:46:01,953 --> 00:46:03,455
?
You didn't prove it at all
! What are you talking about

908
00:46:03,955 --> 00:46:05,957
Wait. Supposing he
really did hear it?

909
00:46:05,957 --> 00:46:09,961
This phrase, how many time
s have all of us used it?
Probably thousands.

910
00:46:09,961 --> 00:46:11,963
"I could kill you
for that, darling."

911
00:46:12,464 --> 00:46:13,965
"Junior, you do that once more
and I'm going to kill you."

912
00:46:13,965 --> 00:46:15,834
"Get in there, Rocky,
and kill him."
We say it everyday.

913
00:46:15,834 --> 00:46:17,335
That doesn't mean
we're really gonna
kill anybody.

914
00:46:17,335 --> 00:46:18,837
Wait a minute. What are you
trying to give us here?

915
00:46:19,337 --> 00:46:20,338
The phrase was,
"I'm going to kill you."

916
00:46:20,839 --> 00:46:22,841
The kid yelled it at
the top of his lungs.

917
00:46:22,841 --> 00:46:24,342
Don't tell me he
didn't mean it.

918
00:46:24,843 --> 00:46:26,344
Anybody says a thing
like that the way he said it,
they mean it!

919
00:46:26,845 --> 00:46:28,263
Well, gee,
now I don't know.

920
00:46:28,763 --> 00:46:30,765
o
I remember I was arguing
with the guy I work next t

921
00:46:30,765 --> 00:46:32,767
at the bank a couple
of weeks ago.

922
00:46:32,767 --> 00:46:34,769
He called me an idiot,
so I yelled at him.

923
00:46:34,769 --> 00:46:37,856
Now listen, this guy is trying
to make you believe things
that aren't so!

924
00:46:37,856 --> 00:46:40,158
The kid said he was going
to kill him and he did
kill him.

925
00:46:40,158 --> 00:46:41,659
Let me ask you this,
do you really think

926
00:46:41,659 --> 00:46:43,161
the boy would shout it
out a thing like that

927
00:46:43,161 --> 00:46:45,163
so the whole neighborhood
could hear him?

928
00:46:45,163 --> 00:46:46,998
I don't think so.
He's much too bright for that.

929
00:46:46,998 --> 00:46:49,501
Bright? He's a common,
ignorant slob.

930
00:46:50,001 --> 00:46:52,003
He don't even
speak good English.

931
00:46:52,003 --> 00:46:54,506
.
He doesn't even
speak good English

932
00:46:57,091 --> 00:47:00,462
Mr. Foreman, I'd like to
change my vote to not guilty.

933
00:47:01,463 --> 00:47:02,464
You what?

934
00:47:02,464 --> 00:47:03,465
You heard me.

935
00:47:03,465 --> 00:47:05,467
JUROR #1: Are you sure?

936
00:47:05,967 --> 00:47:07,302
Yeah, I'm sure.

937
00:47:07,302 --> 00:47:09,771
The vote is 9-3
in favor of guilty.

938
00:47:09,771 --> 00:47:12,440
Well, if this isn't
the living end!

939
00:47:16,444 --> 00:47:19,948
What are you basing it on?
Stories this guy made up?

940
00:47:19,948 --> 00:47:21,950
You ought to write for
one of those kooky
detective magazines,

941
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:24,369
you'd make a fortune.

942
00:47:24,369 --> 00:47:27,872
For crying out loud,
the kid's own lawyer knew
he didn't stand a chance.

943
00:47:28,373 --> 00:47:31,876
Right from the beginning,
his own lawyer knew,
and you could see it.

944
00:47:31,876 --> 00:47:35,880
Boy, oh, boy,
I'm telling you. This guy
here is really something.

945
00:47:36,381 --> 00:47:37,799
Look, the kid had a lawyer
, didn't he?

946
00:47:38,299 --> 00:47:39,801
He presented
his case, not you.

947
00:47:39,801 --> 00:47:40,802
How come you got
so much to say?

948
00:47:41,302 --> 00:47:42,303
JUROR #5: Look, lawyers
aren't infallible, you know.

949
00:47:42,804 --> 00:47:43,805
Baltimore, please.

950
00:47:43,805 --> 00:47:45,306
He was court-appointed.

951
00:47:45,306 --> 00:47:46,307
Now what's that
supposed to mean?

952
00:47:46,808 --> 00:47:48,259
Well, it could
mean a lot of things.

953
00:47:48,259 --> 00:47:51,262
It could mean he didn't
want the case or he
resented being appointed.

954
00:47:51,262 --> 00:47:52,764
It's the kind of case
that brings you nothing,

955
00:47:52,764 --> 00:47:55,767
no money, no glory,
not even much
chance of winning.

956
00:47:56,267 --> 00:47:59,270
That's not a very promising
situation for a young lawyer.

957
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:01,773
He'd really have to believ
e in his client to put up
any kind of a good case

958
00:48:02,273 --> 00:48:03,658
and as you pointed out
a minute ago,
obviously he didn't.

959
00:48:04,158 --> 00:48:06,160
Of course he didn't.

960
00:48:07,161 --> 00:48:09,163
Who the heck could?

961
00:48:09,163 --> 00:48:12,166
Except maybe
some guy's mother
or somebody, I...

962
00:48:12,166 --> 00:48:15,587
Oh, look.
Will you look at the time?
Come on, for crying...

963
00:48:16,087 --> 00:48:19,090
Pardon me.
I have made
some notes here,

964
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:22,594
and I would like,
please, to say something.

965
00:48:22,594 --> 00:48:25,597
I have been listening
very carefully and

966
00:48:25,597 --> 00:48:29,100
it seems to me that this man
has some very good points
to make.

967
00:48:29,601 --> 00:48:31,603
From what was
presented at the trial,

968
00:48:31,603 --> 00:48:33,605
the boy looks guilty,
on the surface.

969
00:48:34,105 --> 00:48:36,107
But maybe if we go deeper...

970
00:48:36,107 --> 00:48:38,109
Come on, will you?

971
00:48:38,109 --> 00:48:40,612
There is a question
I would like to ask.

972
00:48:40,612 --> 00:48:44,115
Let us assume that the boy
really did commit the murder.

973
00:48:44,115 --> 00:48:47,118
Now, this happened at 12:10.

974
00:48:47,535 --> 00:48:49,537
Now, how was he
caught by the police?

975
00:48:50,038 --> 00:48:54,542
He came back home
at 3:00 or so,

976
00:48:54,542 --> 00:48:58,046
and he was captured
by two detectives
in the hallway of his house.

977
00:48:58,546 --> 00:49:03,051
Now, my question is,
if he really had
killed his father,

978
00:49:03,051 --> 00:49:06,054
why would he come back hom
e three hours later?

979
00:49:06,554 --> 00:49:09,557
Wouldn't he be afraid
of being caught?

980
00:49:09,557 --> 00:49:11,059
He came home
to get his knife.

981
00:49:11,059 --> 00:49:13,561
It's not nice to go around
leaving knives sticking
in people's chests.

982
00:49:13,561 --> 00:49:15,563
Yeah, especially relatives'.

983
00:49:15,563 --> 00:49:16,564
(LAUGHING)

984
00:49:16,564 --> 00:49:19,434
JUROR #4: I don't see
anything funny about it.

985
00:49:19,434 --> 00:49:22,437
The boy knew the knife could
be identified as the one he
had just bought.

986
00:49:22,437 --> 00:49:24,939
He had to get it
before the police did.

987
00:49:24,939 --> 00:49:26,941
JUROR #11: But if he knew
the knife could be identified,

988
00:49:26,941 --> 00:49:29,944
why did he leave it there
in the first place?

989
00:49:29,944 --> 00:49:32,447
Well, I think we can assum
e the boy ran out
in a state of panic

990
00:49:32,947 --> 00:49:35,249
after having just
killed his father.

991
00:49:35,249 --> 00:49:38,169
When he finally calmed down,
he realized he'd
left his knife there.

992
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:41,673
"
This, then, depends on
your definition of "panic.

993
00:49:41,673 --> 00:49:42,674
He would have had
to be calm enough

994
00:49:43,174 --> 00:49:46,177
to see to it that
there were no fingerprints
left on the knife.

995
00:49:46,678 --> 00:49:50,431
?
Now, where did this panic
start and where did it end

996
00:49:50,431 --> 00:49:53,518
Look, you voted guilty
. What side are you on?

997
00:49:53,518 --> 00:49:56,521
I don't believe I have
to be loyal to one side
or the other.

998
00:49:56,521 --> 00:49:58,773
I'm simply asking questions.

999
00:49:58,773 --> 00:50:02,060
Well, this is just
off the top of my head,

1000
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:04,062
g
but if I were the boy
and I'd done
the stabbing and everythin

1001
00:50:04,062 --> 00:50:06,564
I'd take a chance and
go back for the knife.

1002
00:50:06,564 --> 00:50:09,067
I'll bet he figured
that nobody had seen
him running out

1003
00:50:09,067 --> 00:50:11,569
and that the body wouldn't be
discovered till the next day.

1004
00:50:11,569 --> 00:50:13,571
After all, it was
the middle of the night.

1005
00:50:13,571 --> 00:50:16,124
I'll bet he figured nobody
would find the body till
the next day.

1006
00:50:16,124 --> 00:50:18,376
Pardon.
This is my whole point.

1007
00:50:18,376 --> 00:50:19,877
The woman across
the street testified

1008
00:50:20,378 --> 00:50:21,879
that the moment after
she saw the killing,

1009
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:24,382
that is, a moment
after the train went by,

1010
00:50:24,882 --> 00:50:27,885
she screamed,
and then went to
telephone the police.

1011
00:50:27,885 --> 00:50:31,389
Now, the boy certainly
must have heard the scream,

1012
00:50:31,389 --> 00:50:34,892
so he knew that
somebody saw something.

1013
00:50:34,892 --> 00:50:37,395
I just don't think
that he would have gone back.

1014
00:50:37,395 --> 00:50:40,898
Two things. One, in his state
of panic, he may not have
heard the scream.

1015
00:50:40,898 --> 00:50:42,400
Perhaps it wasn't
very loud.

1016
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,903
Two, if he did hear it,
he may not have connected it
with his own acts.

1017
00:50:45,903 --> 00:50:48,906
Remember, he lived in a
neighborhood where screams
were fairly commonplace.

1018
00:50:48,906 --> 00:50:49,774
There's your answer.

1019
00:50:50,274 --> 00:50:53,277
Maybe. Maybe the boy
did kill his father.

1020
00:50:53,778 --> 00:50:55,780
Didn't hear the scream,
did run out in a panic,

1021
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:57,782
did calm down

1022
00:50:57,782 --> 00:50:59,784
three hours later
and come back
to get the knife,

1023
00:50:59,784 --> 00:51:01,285
risking being
caught by the police.

1024
00:51:01,285 --> 00:51:04,288
Maybe all of those things
happened, but maybe
they didn't.

1025
00:51:04,288 --> 00:51:05,790
I think there's enough doubt
that we can wonder

1026
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:08,292
whether he was there at all
during the time
the killing took place.

1027
00:51:08,292 --> 00:51:10,294
?
What do you mean, "doubt"?
What are you talking about

1028
00:51:10,294 --> 00:51:11,796
Didn't the old man see him
running out of the house?

1029
00:51:11,796 --> 00:51:13,798
He's twisting the facts.
I'm telling you.

1030
00:51:14,298 --> 00:51:17,301
Did or didn't the old man
see the kid running out
of the house at 12:10?

1031
00:51:17,301 --> 00:51:19,303
?
Well, did or didn't he

1032
00:51:19,303 --> 00:51:20,304
.
He says he did

1033
00:51:20,805 --> 00:51:22,807
Says he did?
Boy, how do you like that?

1034
00:51:23,307 --> 00:51:24,308
Look, witnesses
can make mistakes.

1035
00:51:24,308 --> 00:51:25,810
Sure, when you
want them to they do.

1036
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:27,812
Or when he wants
them to they do!
You know what I mean?

1037
00:51:27,812 --> 00:51:29,814
Keep the yelling down.

1038
00:51:29,814 --> 00:51:31,816
Oh, you keep saying that.
Maybe what we need
is a little yelling in here.

1039
00:51:31,816 --> 00:51:33,818
These guys keep
going off every which way.

1040
00:51:33,818 --> 00:51:35,820
Did hear the scream,
didn't hear the scream,

1041
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:37,321
what difference
does it make?

1042
00:51:37,321 --> 00:51:39,240
You people are talking
only about
the little details.

1043
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,242
You're forgetting
the important stuff.
I mean, all of a sudden...

1044
00:51:41,242 --> 00:51:42,243
I'm gonna call
for another vote.

1045
00:51:42,744 --> 00:51:43,745
I'm talking here!

1046
00:51:43,745 --> 00:51:46,247
Another vote
called for.

1047
00:51:46,247 --> 00:51:48,249
Now let's take
our seats.

1048
00:51:51,252 --> 00:51:54,255
I never saw so much
time spent on nothing.

1049
00:51:54,255 --> 00:51:57,141
It only takes a second.

1050
00:51:57,141 --> 00:52:00,645
JUROR #1: Okay, I guess
the fastest way is to find
out who's voting not guilty.

1051
00:52:00,645 --> 00:52:04,649
All those voting not guilty,
please raise your hands.

1052
00:52:04,649 --> 00:52:08,152
Still the same.
One, two, three not guilty
. Nine guilty.

1053
00:52:08,152 --> 00:52:09,654
JUROR #7: So now where are we?

1054
00:52:09,654 --> 00:52:11,155
I'll tell you,
we can yakety-yak
here till next Tuesday.

1055
00:52:11,656 --> 00:52:13,157
Where's it all getting us?

1056
00:52:13,157 --> 00:52:16,160
Pardon. I vote not guilty.

1057
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:19,030
(JURORS EXCLAIMING)

1058
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:20,414
What are you talking about?

1059
00:52:20,414 --> 00:52:22,750
I mean, we're all going
crazy in here or something.

1060
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:26,754
The kid is guilty.
Why don't you
listen to the facts?

1061
00:52:26,754 --> 00:52:28,756
Tell him, will you?
This is getting to be a joke.

1062
00:52:29,257 --> 00:52:32,260
JUROR #1: The vote is 8-4
in favor of guilty.

1063
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:36,264
Hey, what is this? "Love Your
Underprivileged Brother"
week or something?

1064
00:52:36,264 --> 00:52:38,266
I want you to get up
and tell me why you
changed your vote.

1065
00:52:38,766 --> 00:52:39,767
Come on, now,
give me reasons.

1066
00:52:40,268 --> 00:52:42,770
I don't have to defend
my decision to you.

1067
00:52:43,271 --> 00:52:44,772
There is a reasonable
doubt in my mind.

1068
00:52:44,772 --> 00:52:46,774
What reasonable doubt?
That's nothing but words.

1069
00:52:46,774 --> 00:52:47,775
.
Here, look at this

1070
00:52:47,775 --> 00:52:49,777
The kid you just
decided isn't guilty

1071
00:52:49,777 --> 00:52:52,780
was seen ramming
this into his father!

1072
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:54,782
Now what about this,
Mr. Reasonable Doubt?

1073
00:52:54,782 --> 00:52:57,785
That's not the knife,
don't you remember?

1074
00:52:57,785 --> 00:52:59,787
Oh, brilliant!

1075
00:53:00,288 --> 00:53:02,290
I'm telling you,
this is the craziest.

1076
00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:04,292
I mean, what are we
supposed to believe?

1077
00:53:04,292 --> 00:53:07,628
You're sitting here,
you're pulling stories
out of thin air, you know?

1078
00:53:07,628 --> 00:53:11,632
A guy like this,
if he's sitting ringside
at the Dempsey-Firpo fight,

1079
00:53:11,632 --> 00:53:13,634
he'd be trying to
tell you that...

1080
00:53:14,135 --> 00:53:16,137
Look. Now what
about the old man?

1081
00:53:16,137 --> 00:53:18,639
Are we supposed to believe
that he didn't get up
and run to his door

1082
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:21,642
and see the kid
tearing down the steps
15 seconds after the killing?

1083
00:53:22,143 --> 00:53:24,645
He's just saying so
to be important, right?

1084
00:53:24,645 --> 00:53:26,647
What's the point
of the whole thing?
Hold on a second.

1085
00:53:26,647 --> 00:53:29,150
And the Baltimore rooter
is heard from again, now.

1086
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:31,152
And pop-ups are
falling for base hits
wherever we look.

1087
00:53:31,652 --> 00:53:33,154
Hey, hold on a second.
Now, look.

1088
00:53:33,154 --> 00:53:35,156
Did the old man say
he ran to the door?

1089
00:53:35,156 --> 00:53:36,657
Ran, walked,
what's the difference?

1090
00:53:36,657 --> 00:53:38,776
He got there, didn't he?
No, well, wait a second...

1091
00:53:38,776 --> 00:53:40,778
He said he ran.
At least, I think he did.

1092
00:53:41,279 --> 00:53:42,280
Look, I don't
remember what he said,

1093
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,781
but I don't see how he
could have run to the door.

1094
00:53:44,282 --> 00:53:47,785
He said he went from his
bedroom to the front door.
Now, isn't that enough?

1095
00:53:47,785 --> 00:53:49,287
Where was the bedroom?
It was down
the hall somewhere.

1096
00:53:49,787 --> 00:53:51,789
I thought you
remembered everything.
Don't you remember that?

1097
00:53:51,789 --> 00:53:55,293
.
No. Mr. Foreman,
I'd like to see
a diagram of the apartment

1098
00:53:55,293 --> 00:53:57,795
JUROR #7: Look, why don't we
have him run the trial all
over again, so...

1099
00:53:57,795 --> 00:53:59,297
Mr. Foreman!
How come you'r
e the only one

1100
00:53:59,297 --> 00:54:00,798
in this room who
wants to see exhibits
all the time?

1101
00:54:01,132 --> 00:54:02,099
I want to see
this one, too.

1102
00:54:02,099 --> 00:54:04,101
And I'd like to
stop wasting time.

1103
00:54:04,101 --> 00:54:06,103
If we're going
to start wading throug
h all that nonsense

1104
00:54:06,103 --> 00:54:07,104
.
about where
the body was found

1105
00:54:07,104 --> 00:54:08,606
.
We're not. Not unless
somebody else wants to

1106
00:54:08,606 --> 00:54:10,608
But I'd like to
find out if an old man

1107
00:54:10,608 --> 00:54:13,611
who drags one foot when he
walks because he had a stroke
last year

1108
00:54:13,611 --> 00:54:15,613
can get from his bedroom
to his front door
in 15 seconds.

1109
00:54:16,113 --> 00:54:17,114
.
He said 20 seconds.
He said 15

1110
00:54:17,615 --> 00:54:19,617
He said 20 seconds.
What are you
trying to distort?

1111
00:54:20,117 --> 00:54:21,619
JUROR #11: He said 15.

1112
00:54:21,619 --> 00:54:23,621
How does he know
how long 15 seconds is?

1113
00:54:23,621 --> 00:54:25,122
You can't judge
a thing like that.

1114
00:54:25,122 --> 00:54:27,124
JUROR #9: He said 15 seconds.
He was very positive about it.

1115
00:54:27,124 --> 00:54:29,627
He was an old man!
Half the time
he was confused!

1116
00:54:29,627 --> 00:54:32,630
How could he be
positive about anything?

1117
00:54:40,004 --> 00:54:41,505
I don't see what you'r
e going to prove here.

1118
00:54:41,505 --> 00:54:44,008
The man said he saw
the boy running out.

1119
00:54:44,008 --> 00:54:46,010
Well, let's see if
the details bear him out.

1120
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:47,511
As soon as
the body hit the floor,

1121
00:54:48,012 --> 00:54:51,015
he said he heard footsteps
upstairs, running toward
the front door.

1122
00:54:51,015 --> 00:54:54,018
Heard the upstairs door open,
the footsteps
start down the stairs.

1123
00:54:54,018 --> 00:54:56,020
He said he got to his own
front door as fast as he could

1124
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:58,522
and he swore it
couldn't have been
more than 15 seconds.

1125
00:54:58,522 --> 00:55:00,024
Now if the killer
began running immediately...

1126
00:55:00,524 --> 00:55:01,525
.
JUROR #12: Maybe he didn't

1127
00:55:01,525 --> 00:55:03,027
The old man said he did.

1128
00:55:03,027 --> 00:55:05,529
.
You ought to be at
Atlantic City at that
hair-splitters' convention

1129
00:55:05,529 --> 00:55:09,033
Hey, why don't you stop
making smart remarks
all the time, huh?

1130
00:55:09,033 --> 00:55:11,535
My friend, for your $3 a day,
you have to listen
to everything.

1131
00:55:11,535 --> 00:55:13,287
Now that you got
that thing in here,
what about it?

1132
00:55:13,788 --> 00:55:15,289
All right,
here's the apartment
where the killing took place.

1133
00:55:15,289 --> 00:55:19,293
The old man's apartmen
t was directly beneath
and exactly the same.

1134
00:55:19,293 --> 00:55:22,296
Here are the El tracks,
the bedroom, living room,
kitchen, bathroom,

1135
00:55:22,797 --> 00:55:24,298
here's the hall,
here are the stairs.

1136
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:26,801
.
Now, the old man was
in this bedroom right here

1137
00:55:26,801 --> 00:55:29,303
He says he
crossed to the door,
walked down the hall,

1138
00:55:29,804 --> 00:55:31,305
opened the front
door just in time

1139
00:55:31,305 --> 00:55:33,808
to see the boy
running down the stairs.
Am I right so far?

1140
00:55:33,808 --> 00:55:36,227
JUROR #3: That's the story,
for the 19th time.

1141
00:55:36,227 --> 00:55:38,229
15 seconds after
the body hit the floor
.

1142
00:55:38,729 --> 00:55:39,814
JUROR #11: Correct.

1143
00:55:39,814 --> 00:55:41,816
Now, let's see. It was...

1144
00:55:41,816 --> 00:55:45,820
It's 12 feet from
the bed to the door.
The hall is 43 feet.

1145
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:49,323
He would have had
to walk 12 feet,
open the bedroom door,

1146
00:55:49,323 --> 00:55:52,660
walk 43 feet down
and open the front door,
all in 15 seconds.

1147
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:54,078
You think he
could have done it
?

1148
00:55:54,078 --> 00:55:55,579
JUROR #10:
Sure he could have done it.

1149
00:55:55,579 --> 00:55:56,881
JUROR #11: He can
walk only very slowly.

1150
00:55:56,881 --> 00:55:58,299
They had to help him
into the witness chair.

1151
00:55:58,299 --> 00:55:59,800
JUROR #3: You make it soun
d like a long walk.

1152
00:56:00,301 --> 00:56:03,304
For an old man
who had a stroke,
it is a long walk.

1153
00:56:03,804 --> 00:56:04,805
What are you doing?

1154
00:56:04,805 --> 00:56:06,307
I'm going to try it.
See how long it took.

1155
00:56:06,307 --> 00:56:07,808
?
What do you mean,
you want to try it

1156
00:56:07,808 --> 00:56:09,310
Why didn't his
lawyer bring it up
if it's so important?

1157
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:10,311
Maybe he just
didn't think about it.

1158
00:56:10,311 --> 00:56:11,812
What do you mean he
didn't think of it?

1159
00:56:11,812 --> 00:56:12,813
Do you think the man's
an idiot or something?

1160
00:56:12,813 --> 00:56:14,315
It's an obvious thing.
Did you think of it?

1161
00:56:14,815 --> 00:56:16,317
Listen, smart guy.
It don't matter whethe
r I thought of it.

1162
00:56:16,317 --> 00:56:17,818
He didn't bring it up
because he knew
it'd hurt his case.

1163
00:56:17,818 --> 00:56:19,320
What do you
think of that?

1164
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,105
Maybe he didn't bring
it up because it would
have meant bullying

1165
00:56:21,105 --> 00:56:23,107
and badgering
a helpless old man.

1166
00:56:23,107 --> 00:56:24,608
You know that doesn't
sit very well with a jury.

1167
00:56:24,608 --> 00:56:26,494
Most lawyers
avoid it if they can.

1168
00:56:26,494 --> 00:56:27,995
So what kind of
a bum is he then?

1169
00:56:28,496 --> 00:56:30,498
That's what I've
been asking, buddy.
Pass me that chair, will you?

1170
00:56:30,998 --> 00:56:31,999
Those two chairs
are the old man's bed.

1171
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,001
I just paced off 12
feet across the room.

1172
00:56:34,001 --> 00:56:35,503
This will be
the bedroom door.

1173
00:56:35,503 --> 00:56:38,005
That's crazy.
You can't recreate
a thing like that.

1174
00:56:38,506 --> 00:56:41,509
The hall was 43 feet.
I'll pace from that
wall and back again.

1175
00:56:43,511 --> 00:56:47,515
This is absolutely insane.
What are you wasting
everybody's time in here for?

1176
00:56:47,515 --> 00:56:50,518
According to you, it'll only
take 15 seconds. Now we can
spare that, see.

00:56:53,554 --> 00:56:56,057
Come on. Knock it off.

1179
00:56:56,057 --> 00:56:59,060
Okay. Okay,
okay, killer.

1180
00:57:00,061 --> 00:57:01,062
Yeah.

1181
00:57:03,564 --> 00:57:05,900
Will you stand right there
and mark the front door?

1182
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:08,402
It was chain-locked
according to the testimony,
remember.

1183
00:57:08,402 --> 00:57:09,904
Has anybody got a watch
with a second hand?

1184
00:57:09,904 --> 00:57:11,155
I have.
When you want me to start,

1185
00:57:11,155 --> 00:57:12,623
stamp your foot.
That'll be the body falling.

1186
00:57:13,124 --> 00:57:15,126
You can time me from there.

to do, play Charades now?

Okay, I'm ready.

What are we waiting for?

1190

speed it up. He can walk
twice as fast as that.

1194

If you want me to walk
faster than that, I will.

What's the time?

1198
00:57:59,003 --> 00:58:02,006
Exactly... 41 seconds.

41!

1200
00:58:03,207 --> 00:58:04,208
Here is what I
think happened.

1201
00:58:04,208 --> 00:58:05,209
The old man heard the fight

1202
00:58:05,209 --> 00:58:07,211
between the boy
and his father
a few hours earlier.

1203
00:58:07,211 --> 00:58:08,212
Then when he's
lying in his bed,

1204
00:58:08,212 --> 00:58:10,214
he heard the body
hit the floor in
the boy's apartment,

1205
00:58:10,214 --> 00:58:11,715
heard the woman scream
from across the street,

1206
00:58:12,216 --> 00:58:13,717
got to his front door
as fast as he could,

1207
00:58:13,717 --> 00:58:16,220
.
heard somebody
racing down the stairs
and assumed it was the boy

1208
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:18,305
I think that's possible.
"Assumed"?

(LAUGHING)

1210

Brother, I've seen all kinds
of dishonesty in my day,

1211
00:58:23,811 --> 00:58:26,814
but this little display
takes the cake.

1212

r
You all come in here
with your hearts
bleeding all over the floo

about slum kids
and injustice.

1214
00:58:31,819 --> 00:58:33,821
You listen to
some fairytales.

1215
00:58:33,821 --> 00:58:36,323
Suddenly,
you start getting through
to some of these old ladies.

1216
00:58:36,323 --> 00:58:38,826
Well, you're not
getting through to me.
I've had enough.

1217
00:58:39,326 --> 00:58:41,328
What's the matter
with you guys?

1218
00:58:41,328 --> 00:58:43,714
You all know he's guilty!
He's got to burn!

1219
00:58:43,714 --> 00:58:45,666
You're letting him
slip through our fingers.

1220
00:58:45,666 --> 00:58:48,385
"Slip through our fingers"
? Are you his executioner?

1221
00:58:48,385 --> 00:58:51,055
I'm one of them.

1222
00:58:51,055 --> 00:58:52,806
Perhaps you'd like
to pull the switch.

1223
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:54,892
For this kid,
you bet I would.

1224
00:58:55,176 --> 00:58:59,013
I feel sorry for you.
What it must feel like
to wanna pull the switch.

1225
00:58:59,013 --> 00:59:00,564
Ever since you
walked into this room,

1226
00:59:00,564 --> 00:59:02,933
you've been acting like
a self-appointed
public avenger.

1227
00:59:02,933 --> 00:59:05,402
You want to see this boy die
because you personally
want it,

1228
00:59:05,402 --> 00:59:07,321
not because of the facts.

1229
00:59:07,321 --> 00:59:08,822
You're a sadist.

1230

1231
00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:13,360
Let me go!
I'll kill him! I'll kill him!

1232
00:59:13,861 --> 00:59:16,864
You don't really mean
you'll kill me, do you?

1233
00:59:23,504 --> 00:59:26,006
Anything wrong, gentlemen?
I heard some noise.

1234
00:59:26,006 --> 00:59:28,008
No, everything's all right.
We're just...

1235
00:59:28,008 --> 00:59:30,010
Friendly little argument.

Listen, we're through
with that diagram.

1237
00:59:32,012 --> 00:59:35,432
You can take it if you want.
Here you are.

1238
00:59:35,432 --> 00:59:36,433
Thank you.

01:00:07,581 --> 01:00:10,584
"I beg pardon."
What are you
so polite about?

1243
01:00:10,584 --> 01:00:12,586
For the same
reason you're not.

1244

It's the way I
was brought up.

1246
01:00:18,592 --> 01:00:20,594
That's not why we
are here, to fight.

We have a responsibility.

1248

This, I have always thought,
is a remarkable thing
about democracy.

1249
01:00:29,019 --> 01:00:30,521
That we are...

1250
01:00:32,523 --> 01:00:34,525
What is the word?

1251
01:00:34,525 --> 01:00:39,029
Notified.
That we are notified by mail
to come down to this place

1252
01:00:39,530 --> 01:00:42,533
to decide on
the guilt or innocence

1253
01:00:42,533 --> 01:00:46,537
of a man we have
never heard of before.

1254
01:00:46,537 --> 01:00:52,042
We have nothing
to gain or lose
by our verdict.

1255
01:00:52,042 --> 01:00:55,045
This is one of the reasons
why we are strong.

1256
01:00:56,547 --> 01:00:59,550
We should not make
it a personal thing.

1257
01:01:00,551 --> 01:01:02,052
Thank you.

1258

, I might have a cutie here.

1259

I mean, I haven't
given it much thought,

1260
01:01:07,558 --> 01:01:10,060
.
but let's throw it dow
n on the stoop and see
if the cat licks it up

It's really hot, huh?

01:01:27,628 --> 01:01:30,130
Pardon me,
but don't you
ever sweat?

1268
01:01:31,632 --> 01:01:34,134
No, I don't.

1269
01:01:34,134 --> 01:01:39,139
Listen,
I was wondering if...

1270
01:01:39,139 --> 01:01:41,642
Maybe we should
take another vote.

1271
01:01:41,642 --> 01:01:46,647
Great. Maybe we can follow
this one up with a little
dancing and refreshments.

1272
01:01:47,147 --> 01:01:48,732
Mr. Foreman?

1273
01:01:48,732 --> 01:01:51,735
Well, that's okay with me.
Anyone doesn't wanna vote?

1274

Hey, come on.

I think we ought to
have an open ballot.
Call out our votes, you know?

1277
01:01:59,493 --> 01:02:01,495
Let's see who stands where.

1278
01:02:01,495 --> 01:02:04,498
Well, that sounds fair to me.
Anyone object?

the kind of boy he is
has anything to do with it

to determine the case.

figure that out, killer?

changed your vote?

You haven't got
a leg to stand on.
You know that, I hope.

1324
01:04:11,291 --> 01:04:12,793
I don't feel that way.

1325
01:04:12,793 --> 01:04:14,294
There were a lot
of details that
never came out.

1326
01:04:14,795 --> 01:04:15,796
Yeah, well, good luck.

1327
01:04:15,796 --> 01:04:18,298
Come on. You're like
everybody else.

1328
01:04:18,298 --> 01:04:20,300
You think too much,
you get mixed up.

1329
01:04:21,802 --> 01:04:23,303
You know what I mean?

1330
01:04:23,303 --> 01:04:25,305
Listen, I don't think
you have any right...

1331
01:04:26,306 --> 01:04:27,307
Loudmouth.

1332
01:04:41,321 --> 01:04:42,823
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

1333
01:05:21,194 --> 01:05:24,698
Look at that
come down, will you?

1334
01:05:25,198 --> 01:05:28,702
You know, this reminds me
of a storm we had last...

1335
01:05:29,202 --> 01:05:30,704
Oh...

1336
01:05:31,204 --> 01:05:32,706
Was it November?

1337
01:05:33,206 --> 01:05:34,708
I don't know. Something.

1338
01:05:34,708 --> 01:05:38,712
It was quite a storm we had.
It was right
in the middle of a game.

1339
01:05:38,712 --> 01:05:41,214
.
We were behind 7-6

1340
01:05:41,214 --> 01:05:43,717
But we'd just started
to move the ball,
made a real tackle.

1341
01:05:43,717 --> 01:05:45,719
It sort of cut right in,
slash through,

1342
01:05:45,719 --> 01:05:48,722
slashed right in,
cut right through.

1343
01:05:48,722 --> 01:05:49,723
And...

1344
01:05:51,224 --> 01:05:53,226
We had this kid,
Slattery.

1345
01:05:54,728 --> 01:05:57,731
He was an ox.
You know, a real ox.

1346
01:05:58,231 --> 01:06:00,734
I wish I had another one
just like him.

1347
01:06:00,734 --> 01:06:03,236
I forgot to tell you.
I'm the assistant head coach

1348
01:06:03,737 --> 01:06:05,238
at Andrew J. McCorkle
High School.

1349
01:06:05,238 --> 01:06:07,240
Really?
That's out in Queens.

1350
01:06:07,741 --> 01:06:12,245
And anyway,
we're starting to
move along real nice.

1351
01:06:12,746 --> 01:06:16,750
You know, their whole line
is just coming apart.

1352
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:20,621
And it starts to come down
, cats and dogs,
just like this.

1353
01:06:20,621 --> 01:06:23,123
Just... You know,
right down.

1354
01:06:24,625 --> 01:06:28,128
Well, it was murder,
you know?

1355
01:06:28,128 --> 01:06:32,132
.
I swear,
I nearly bawled.
We couldn't go nowhere

1356
01:06:51,451 --> 01:06:54,454
Hey, what is it
with this fan here
? How come...

1357
01:07:01,461 --> 01:07:03,463
Hey!

1358
01:07:03,463 --> 01:07:04,464
(CHUCKLES)

1359
01:07:04,965 --> 01:07:07,467
Must have been on
the same switch
with the lights.

1360
01:07:07,968 --> 01:07:10,470
Well, things are
looking up here, huh?

1361
01:07:11,471 --> 01:07:12,472
Yeah.

1362
01:07:17,978 --> 01:07:19,479
Boy, that's better.

1363
01:07:26,486 --> 01:07:28,989
Hey! Two points.

1364
01:07:33,994 --> 01:07:35,912
Any of you guys
ever go to the Garden?

1365
01:07:37,948 --> 01:07:40,701
That's a damn
stupid thing to do.

1366
01:07:41,201 --> 01:07:43,203
Oh, I'm sorry. I...

1367
01:07:44,705 --> 01:07:45,789
You know?

1368
01:07:47,541 --> 01:07:49,926
Pardon me.

1369
01:07:49,926 --> 01:07:54,431
Well, how do you like it?
Even-steven.
Pretty surprising, isn't it?

1370
01:07:54,931 --> 01:07:55,932
Yes.

1371
01:07:58,435 --> 01:08:01,438
That business before,
when that tall guy,

1372
01:08:01,438 --> 01:08:03,440
what's-his-name,
was trying to bait me?

1373
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,442
.
That doesn't
prove anything

1374
01:08:05,442 --> 01:08:07,444
I'm a pretty
excitable person.

1375
01:08:07,444 --> 01:08:11,448
Where does he come off
calling me a public avenger,
a sadist, and everything?

1376
01:08:11,448 --> 01:08:14,451
Anyone in his right mind
would blow his stack.

1377
01:08:14,951 --> 01:08:16,953
He was just
trying to bait me.

1378
01:08:16,953 --> 01:08:18,955
He did an excellent job.

1379
01:08:21,792 --> 01:08:24,294
I'll tell you what I think
, we're going nowhere here.

1380
01:08:24,294 --> 01:08:26,797
I'm ready to walk
into court right now
and declare a hung jury.

1381
01:08:26,797 --> 01:08:28,298
There's no point in
this thing going on anymore.

1382
01:08:28,298 --> 01:08:29,800
Yeah, I go for that, too.

1383
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:31,301
Listen, let's take it
in to the judge

1384
01:08:31,301 --> 01:08:32,803
and let the kid take
his chances with 12
other guys.

1385
01:08:33,303 --> 01:08:34,805
I don't think
the judge will
accept a hung jury.

1386
01:08:34,805 --> 01:08:36,306
We haven't been
in here very long.

1387
01:08:36,306 --> 01:08:37,808
Well, let's find out.

1388
01:08:37,808 --> 01:08:39,309
JUROR #11: I am no
t in favor of that.

1389
01:08:39,309 --> 01:08:42,813
Listen, this kid wouldn't
stand a chance with
another jury, and you know it.

1390
01:08:42,813 --> 01:08:44,815
Come on, we're hung.
Nobody's gonna
change his vote.

1391
01:08:44,815 --> 01:08:46,316
Let's take it inside.

1392
01:08:46,316 --> 01:08:47,818
You still don't think
there's room for
reasonable doubt?

1393
01:08:48,318 --> 01:08:49,936
No, I don't.

1394
01:08:49,936 --> 01:08:54,691
Pardon. Maybe you
don't fully understand
the term "reasonable doubt".

1395
01:08:54,691 --> 01:08:57,694
What do you mean,
I don't understand?

1396
01:08:57,694 --> 01:09:00,197
How do you like this guy?

1397
01:09:00,197 --> 01:09:01,198
I'm telling you,
they're all alike.

1398
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:03,200
They come over here,
running for their life,

1399
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:04,201
and before they can
take a deep breath,

1400
01:09:04,701 --> 01:09:07,204
they're telling us
how to run the show.

1401
01:09:07,204 --> 01:09:08,255
Boy, the arrogance
of this guy!

1402
01:09:08,755 --> 01:09:09,756
JUROR #1: All right.

1403
01:09:10,257 --> 01:09:13,260
Let's stop the arguing
for about two minutes in here.

1404
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:15,962
Now, who's got something
constructive to say?

1405
01:09:15,962 --> 01:09:19,466
I'd like to go
over something,
if you gentlemen don't mind.

1406
01:09:19,966 --> 01:09:23,470
An important point
for the prosecutio
n was the fact that

1407
01:09:23,470 --> 01:09:25,472
s
after the boy claimed
he'd been at the movie

1408
01:09:25,472 --> 01:09:26,973
during the hours
that the killing took place,

1409
01:09:26,973 --> 01:09:28,975
s
he couldn't remember
the names of the movie

1410
01:09:28,975 --> 01:09:31,478
or the stars who
appeared in them.

1411
01:09:31,478 --> 01:09:33,980
This gentleman here ha
s brought up that point
in here several times.

1412
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:35,482
That's correct.

1413
01:09:35,482 --> 01:09:36,983
It was the only
alibi the boy offered,

1414
01:09:37,484 --> 01:09:39,986
and he himself
couldn't back it up
with any details at all.

1415
01:09:39,986 --> 01:09:41,571
,
Putting yourselves
in the boy's place

1416
01:09:41,571 --> 01:09:44,574
do you think you
could remember details
after an upsetting experience

1417
01:09:44,574 --> 01:09:46,576
?
such as being slapped
in the face by your father

1418
01:09:47,077 --> 01:09:50,080
I think so, if there were
any special details
to remember.

1419
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:52,082
The boy couldn't
remember the names
of the movies he saw,

1420
01:09:52,082 --> 01:09:53,834
because he wasn't
there that night.

1421
01:09:53,834 --> 01:09:55,335
According to the polic
e testimony in court,

1422
01:09:55,335 --> 01:09:58,338
the boy was questioned by
the detectives in the kitchen
of his apartment,

1423
01:09:58,839 --> 01:10:01,842
while the body of his father
was lying on the floor
in the bedroom.

1424
01:10:01,842 --> 01:10:04,344
Do you think you
could remember details
under those circumstances?

1425
01:10:04,344 --> 01:10:06,146
I do.
Under great
emotional stress?

1426
01:10:06,479 --> 01:10:07,480
Under great emotional stress.

1427
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:08,982
.
He remembered them
correctly in court

1428
01:10:08,982 --> 01:10:10,984
He named the pictures
and the stars
who played in them.

1429
01:10:10,984 --> 01:10:14,487
Yes. His lawyer took
great pains to bring that out.

1430
01:10:14,487 --> 01:10:15,989
He had three months
from the night of the murder

1431
01:10:15,989 --> 01:10:18,491
to the day of the trial
in which to memorize them.

1432
01:10:18,491 --> 01:10:19,993
It's not difficult
for a lawyer to find out

1433
01:10:19,993 --> 01:10:22,996
what played at a particular
theater on a particular night.

1434
01:10:22,996 --> 01:10:24,497
I'll take the testimony
of the policeman

1435
01:10:24,998 --> 01:10:27,000
who interrogated the boy
right after the murder,

1436
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:31,371
when he couldn't remember
a thing about the movies,
great emotional stress or not.

1437
01:10:31,371 --> 01:10:33,874
I'd like to ask you
a personal question.

1438
01:10:33,874 --> 01:10:34,875
Go ahead.

1439
01:10:34,875 --> 01:10:36,877
Where were you
last night?

1440
01:10:36,877 --> 01:10:37,878
I was home.

1441
01:10:37,878 --> 01:10:39,379
How about the nigh
t before that?

1442
01:10:39,379 --> 01:10:40,881
JUROR #10: Come on
. What is this?

1443
01:10:40,881 --> 01:10:42,182
No, it's all right.

1444
01:10:42,182 --> 01:10:44,684
I left the office at 8:30
and went straight home
and to bed.

1445
01:10:44,684 --> 01:10:46,186
And the night before that?

1446
01:10:46,686 --> 01:10:49,189
That was Tuesday night.

1447
01:10:49,189 --> 01:10:51,141
The night of
the bridge tournament.
I played bridge.

1448
01:10:51,141 --> 01:10:52,642
Monday night?

1449
01:10:52,642 --> 01:10:55,812
JUROR #7: When you get down
to New Year's Eve 1954,
let me know.

1450
01:10:57,814 --> 01:10:59,316
Monday night?

1451
01:11:00,817 --> 01:11:03,820
Monday night,
my wife and I
went to the movies.

1452
01:11:04,321 --> 01:11:05,822
What did you see?
The Scarlet Circle.

1453
01:11:05,822 --> 01:11:07,207
It is a very clever whodunit.

1454
01:11:07,207 --> 01:11:08,708
What was the second feature?

1455
01:11:09,209 --> 01:11:10,160
The...

1456
01:11:11,661 --> 01:11:14,164
I'll tell you in a minute.

1457
01:11:14,664 --> 01:11:17,167
The Remarkable Mrs...

1458
01:11:18,168 --> 01:11:19,669
Something...

1459
01:11:21,171 --> 01:11:24,140
Mrs. Bainbridge.
The Remarkable
Mrs. Bainbridge.

1460
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:27,928
I saw that. It's called
The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge.

1461
01:11:27,928 --> 01:11:30,230
Yes. The Amazing
Mrs. Bainbridge.
I think that's right.

1462
01:11:30,647 --> 01:11:32,732
Who was in The Amazing
Mrs. Bainbridge?

1463
01:11:33,233 --> 01:11:38,238
Barbara Long, I think it was.
A dark, very pretty girl.

1464
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:42,575
Ling, or Long.
Something like that.

1465
01:11:42,575 --> 01:11:43,576
Who else?

1466
01:11:43,910 --> 01:11:46,329
I'd never heard
of them before.

1467
01:11:46,329 --> 01:11:50,283
It was a very inexpensive
second feature,
with unknown...

1468
01:11:50,784 --> 01:11:53,837
And you weren't under
an emotional stress,
were you?

1469
01:11:56,339 --> 01:11:57,340
No.

1470
01:11:58,842 --> 01:12:00,343
I wasn't.

1471
01:12:02,448 --> 01:12:03,949
I think the point is made.

1472
01:12:03,949 --> 01:12:06,952
Big point.

1473
01:12:06,952 --> 01:12:10,956
You can talk till your tongue
is dragging on the floor.
The boy is guilty. Period.

1474
01:12:10,956 --> 01:12:13,459
Know what I mean,
my friend?

1475
01:12:13,459 --> 01:12:14,877
You got those
cough drops?

1476
01:12:14,877 --> 01:12:16,879
They're all gone, my friend.

1477
01:12:18,931 --> 01:12:20,933
Oh, boy.
Look at that rain.

1478
01:12:20,933 --> 01:12:22,434
.
There goes
your ball game

1479
01:12:23,435 --> 01:12:25,938
It's only a shower.

1480
01:12:25,938 --> 01:12:28,440
Besides, they got
the infield covered.

1481
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:31,810
Say, could I see that knife
a second, please?

1482
01:12:34,279 --> 01:12:38,283
?
Well, we're still
tied up 6-6.
Who's got a suggestion

1483
01:12:38,784 --> 01:12:40,285
It's 6:05.
Let's get some dinner.

1484
01:12:40,786 --> 01:12:43,288
Why don't we wait till 7:00?
Give it another hour.

1485
01:12:43,288 --> 01:12:44,790
Okay with me.

1486
01:12:44,790 --> 01:12:47,159
There's something
I'd like to say.

1487
01:12:47,659 --> 01:12:51,163
I mean, it's been
bothering me a little,
and as long as we're stuck...

1488
01:12:51,663 --> 01:12:55,167
There was this whole business
about the stab wound and how
it was made.

1489
01:12:55,667 --> 01:12:56,668
The downward
angle of it, you know?

1490
01:12:56,668 --> 01:12:59,171
Don't tell me
we're gonna start
with that again.

1491
01:12:59,171 --> 01:13:00,672
They've been
over it and over it.

1492
01:13:00,672 --> 01:13:03,175
I know they did,
but I don't go along with it.

1493
01:13:03,175 --> 01:13:07,179
Now, the boy was 5'7" tall
. His father was 6'2".

1494
01:13:07,179 --> 01:13:09,681
That's a difference
of seven inches.

1495
01:13:09,681 --> 01:13:12,184
It's a very awkward thing
to stab down into the chest

1496
01:13:12,184 --> 01:13:14,186
of someone who's
more than half a foot
taller than you are.

1497
01:13:14,186 --> 01:13:16,688
Give me that.

1498
01:13:16,688 --> 01:13:19,608
I'll give you a demonstration.
Somebody get up.

1499
01:13:27,449 --> 01:13:29,952
I want you to watch this
'cause I don't wanna
have to do it again.

1500
01:13:29,952 --> 01:13:32,955
I'll make myself about
six or seven inches shorter.
Okay?

1501
01:13:32,955 --> 01:13:34,456
That's about right.
Maybe a little more.

1502
01:13:34,456 --> 01:13:36,458
Okay, a little more.

1503
01:13:43,966 --> 01:13:45,467
(ALL YELLING)

1504
01:13:48,470 --> 01:13:49,972
.
Now, nobody's hurt

1505
01:13:51,473 --> 01:13:52,474
Right?

1506
01:13:52,975 --> 01:13:53,976
Right. Nobody hurt.

1507
01:13:57,980 --> 01:14:02,985
Now, this is the way
I'd stab a man who was
taller than I was.

1508
01:14:02,985 --> 01:14:05,487
Look at the angle.
Down and in.

1509
01:14:05,487 --> 01:14:07,489
And this is
the way it was done.

1510
01:14:07,489 --> 01:14:08,991
Now tell me I'm wrong.

1511
01:14:11,994 --> 01:14:13,495
Down and in.
I guess there'
s no argument.

1512
01:14:13,495 --> 01:14:15,497
Hold on a minute,
will you?

1513
01:14:15,497 --> 01:14:17,499
Will you give me that?

1514
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,419
Boy, I hate these things.

1515
01:14:20,419 --> 01:14:21,920
Did you ever see
a knife fight?
No.

1516
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:23,422
.
You?
No

1517
01:14:23,922 --> 01:14:26,425
Anybody here ever
see a knife fight?

1518
01:14:26,925 --> 01:14:31,930
Well, I have. You know,
on my back stoop, the lot
across the street, backyard.

1519
01:14:31,930 --> 01:14:34,433
Switchblades came
with the neighborhood
where I lived.

1520
01:14:34,933 --> 01:14:35,934
Funny I never
thought of it before.

1521
01:14:36,435 --> 01:14:37,436
I guess you try to
forget those things.

1522
01:14:37,436 --> 01:14:38,937
How do you
use a switchblade?

1523
01:14:38,937 --> 01:14:40,939
Well, you'd never
use it like this.

1524
01:14:42,941 --> 01:14:45,944
See, you'd lose too much
time switching hands.

1525
01:14:46,945 --> 01:14:48,947
Here's how. Underhanded.

1526
01:14:52,451 --> 01:14:54,453
e
Anyone who's ever
used a switch knif

1527
01:14:54,453 --> 01:14:55,454
wouldn't handle
it any other way.

1528
01:14:55,454 --> 01:14:57,956
Are you sure?
I'm sure.

1529
01:14:57,956 --> 01:14:59,958
.
It's why they're
made to open like that

1530
01:14:59,958 --> 01:15:01,460
You'd say the boy
was pretty handy
with a knife?

1531
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:03,462
Mmm-hmm.

1532
01:15:03,462 --> 01:15:05,964
You think he could have
made the kind of wound
that killed his father?

1533
01:15:05,964 --> 01:15:09,968
No. Not with the experience
he got all his life handling
these things.

1534
01:15:09,968 --> 01:15:11,970
I feel he'd have gone
for him underhanded.

1535
01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:13,472
How do you know?

1536
01:15:13,472 --> 01:15:14,973
Were you in the room
when the father was killed?

1537
01:15:15,474 --> 01:15:16,975
No. Neither was anybody else.

1538
01:15:17,476 --> 01:15:20,479
Then what are you giving us
all this mumbo jumbo for?
I don't believe it.

1539
01:15:20,979 --> 01:15:22,481
I don't think
you can determine
what type of wound

1540
01:15:22,481 --> 01:15:23,982
the boy might or
might not have made

1541
01:15:23,982 --> 01:15:26,485
simply because he knew
how to handle a knife.

1542
01:15:26,485 --> 01:15:28,487
What do you think?

1543
01:15:28,987 --> 01:15:29,988
I don't know.

1544
01:15:29,988 --> 01:15:30,989
What do you mean,
you don't know?

1545
01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:32,991
I don't know.

1546
01:15:37,295 --> 01:15:39,297
How about you?

1547
01:15:39,297 --> 01:15:40,799
I don't know about
the rest of them,

1548
01:15:40,799 --> 01:15:42,801
but I'm getting a little
tired of this yakkety-yakking
back and forth.

1549
01:15:43,301 --> 01:15:46,805
It's getting us nowhere.
So I guess I'll
have to break it up.

1550
01:15:46,805 --> 01:15:49,224
I'm changing my vote
to not guilty.

1551
01:15:49,224 --> 01:15:50,726
You're what?

1552
01:15:50,726 --> 01:15:52,511
You heard me.
I've had enough.

1553
01:15:52,511 --> 01:15:54,930
What do you mean
you've had enough?
That's no answer.

1554
01:15:54,930 --> 01:15:58,100
Listen, you just
take care of yourself.

1555
01:15:58,100 --> 01:15:59,101
You know?

1556
01:15:59,101 --> 01:16:00,686
.
He's right

1557
01:16:00,686 --> 01:16:03,188
That's not an answer.

1558
01:16:03,188 --> 01:16:06,191
What kind of
a man are you?

1559
01:16:06,692 --> 01:16:09,695
You have sat here
and voted guilty
with everyone else

1560
01:16:09,695 --> 01:16:13,699
because there are some
baseball tickets burning
a hole in your pocket.

1561
01:16:14,199 --> 01:16:18,920
Now you have changed your vote
because you say you're sick
of all the talking here?

1562
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:20,922
Now, listen, buddy...

1563
01:16:20,922 --> 01:16:25,260
Who tells you that you have
the right to play like this
with a man's life?

1564
01:16:25,677 --> 01:16:28,180
.
Don't you care...
Now, wait a minute

1565
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:29,548
You can't talk
like that to me.

1566
01:16:29,548 --> 01:16:32,050
I can talk like that to you.

1567
01:16:32,050 --> 01:16:34,052
If you want to
vote not guilty,

1568
01:16:34,052 --> 01:16:36,555
then do it because
you are convinced
the man is not guilty,

1569
01:16:36,555 --> 01:16:38,557
not because
you've had enough.

1570
01:16:38,557 --> 01:16:41,309
And if you think he is guilty,
then vote that way.

1571
01:16:41,309 --> 01:16:44,312
Or don't you have the guts
to do what you think is right?

1572
01:16:44,312 --> 01:16:45,313
Now, listen...

1573
01:16:45,781 --> 01:16:47,399
Guilty or not guilty?

1574
01:16:47,399 --> 01:16:49,818
I told you. Not guilty.

1575
01:16:49,818 --> 01:16:51,286
Why?

1576
01:16:52,788 --> 01:16:54,156
Look, I don't have to...

1577
01:16:54,623 --> 01:16:56,825
You do have to. Say it. Why?

1578
01:16:57,826 --> 01:17:00,829
I don't think he's guilty.

1579
01:17:09,504 --> 01:17:11,506
I want another vote.

1580
01:17:11,506 --> 01:17:14,009
JUROR #1: Okay, that's
another vote called for.

1581
01:17:14,009 --> 01:17:17,012
I guess the quickest way
is a show of hands.
Anyone object?

1582
01:17:17,012 --> 01:17:20,565
Okay,
all those voting not guilty,
raise your hands.

1583
01:17:20,565 --> 01:17:23,068
One, two, three,

1584
01:17:23,435 --> 01:17:26,104
four, five, six, seven,

1585
01:17:29,107 --> 01:17:30,108
eight.

1586
01:17:34,246 --> 01:17:35,580
Um...

1587
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:36,581
Nine.

1588
01:17:39,167 --> 01:17:42,420
All those voting guilty,
raise your hands.

1589
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:43,922
One, two, three.

1590
01:17:44,923 --> 01:17:48,627
Well, the vote's 9-3
in favor of acquittal.

1591
01:17:48,627 --> 01:17:50,629
I don't understand you people!

1592
01:17:50,629 --> 01:17:54,633
All these picky little points
you keep bringing up,
they don't mean nothing!

1593
01:17:54,633 --> 01:17:56,635
You saw this kid
just like I did.

1594
01:17:56,635 --> 01:18:00,138
You're not gonna tell me you
believe that phony story about
losing the knife

1595
01:18:00,138 --> 01:18:02,140
and that business
about being at the movies!

1596
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:05,143
Look, you know how
these people lie.
It's born in them.

1597
01:18:05,143 --> 01:18:07,145
What the heck?
I don't have to tell you.

1598
01:18:07,145 --> 01:18:09,147
They don't know
what the truth is!

1599
01:18:09,147 --> 01:18:11,149
And let me tell you,
they don't need

1600
01:18:11,149 --> 01:18:13,151
any real big reason
to kill someone, either.

1601
01:18:13,151 --> 01:18:16,154
.
No, sir.
They get drunk

1602
01:18:16,154 --> 01:18:18,156
They're real big drinkers,
all of them.

1603
01:18:18,156 --> 01:18:21,159
You know that.
And bang! Someone's
lying in the gutter.

1604
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:24,663
Nobody's blaming them
for it. That's the way
they are, by nature.

1605
01:18:24,663 --> 01:18:26,665
You know what I mean?
Violent.

1606
01:18:26,665 --> 01:18:28,166
Where are you going?

1607
01:18:28,166 --> 01:18:32,170
Human life don't mean
as much to them
as it does to us.

1608
01:18:32,671 --> 01:18:35,173
Look, they're lushing it u
p and fighting all the time,

1609
01:18:35,173 --> 01:18:38,677
and if somebody gets killed,
so somebody gets killed!
They don't care!

1610
01:18:38,677 --> 01:18:41,179
Sure, there's some good things
about them, too.

1611
01:18:41,179 --> 01:18:43,181
Look, I'm the firs
t one to say that.

1612
01:18:43,181 --> 01:18:45,684
I've known a couple
who were okay,
but that's the exception.

1613
01:18:45,684 --> 01:18:47,185
You know what I mean?

1614
01:18:47,185 --> 01:18:50,605
Most of them, it's lik
e they have no feelings!
They can do anything!

1615
01:18:50,605 --> 01:18:53,108
What's going on here?

1616
01:18:53,108 --> 01:18:55,110
I'm trying
to tell you.

1617
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:57,112
You're making a big mistake,
you people.

1618
01:18:57,612 --> 01:19:00,615
This kid is a liar.
I know it.
I know all about them.

1619
01:19:02,117 --> 01:19:04,119
Listen to me.
They're no good.

1620
01:19:04,119 --> 01:19:06,121
There's not one of the
m who's any good.

1621
01:19:08,623 --> 01:19:11,126
I mean, what's happening
in here?

1622
01:19:11,126 --> 01:19:13,628
I speak my piece,
and you...

1623
01:19:14,629 --> 01:19:16,131
Listen to me.

1624
01:19:19,134 --> 01:19:20,135
We're...

1625
01:19:20,135 --> 01:19:22,137
This kid on trial here
. His type.

1626
01:19:22,137 --> 01:19:24,139
Well, don't you
know about them?

1627
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:28,143
There's a...
There's a danger here.

1628
01:19:29,144 --> 01:19:33,148
These people are dangerous
. They're wild.

1629
01:19:34,649 --> 01:19:37,652
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

1630
01:19:37,652 --> 01:19:41,656
I have. Now, sit down
and don't open
your mouth again.

1631
01:19:45,660 --> 01:19:48,163
Some of the time...
I tell you.

1632
01:20:24,916 --> 01:20:30,422
It's always difficult
to keep personal prejudice
out of a thing like this.

1633
01:20:30,422 --> 01:20:33,925
Wherever you run into it,
prejudice always
obscures the truth.

1634
01:20:35,927 --> 01:20:38,430
I don't really know
what the truth is.

1635
01:20:38,430 --> 01:20:42,434
I don't suppose anybody
will ever really know.

1636
01:20:42,434 --> 01:20:46,438
Nine of us now seem
to feel that the defendant
is innocent.

1637
01:20:46,938 --> 01:20:51,443
But we're just
gambling on probabilities.
We may be wrong.

1638
01:20:51,943 --> 01:20:55,447
We may be trying to le
t a guilty man go free.
I don't know.

1639
01:20:55,447 --> 01:20:57,449
Nobody really can.

1640
01:20:57,949 --> 01:21:00,452
,
But we have
a reasonable doubt

1641
01:21:00,452 --> 01:21:03,872
.
and that's something
that's very
valuable in our system

1642
01:21:03,872 --> 01:21:08,376
No jury can
declare a man guilty
unless it's sure.

1643
01:21:09,878 --> 01:21:14,883
We nine can't understand
how you three
are still so sure.

1644
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:16,801
Maybe you can tell us.

1645
01:21:17,302 --> 01:21:18,303
I'll try.

1646
01:21:19,304 --> 01:21:20,805
You've made some
excellent points,

1647
01:21:21,306 --> 01:21:24,809
but I still believe the bo
y is guilty of murder,
and I have two reasons.

1648
01:21:24,809 --> 01:21:27,812
One, the evidence given by
the woman across the street,

1649
01:21:27,812 --> 01:21:30,815
who actually saw
the murder committed.

1650
01:21:30,815 --> 01:21:33,318
As far as I'm concerned,
that's the most
important testimony.

1651
01:21:33,318 --> 01:21:35,820
And two, the fact that
she described the stabbing

1652
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:39,324
d
by saying she saw the boy
raise his arm over his hea

1653
01:21:39,324 --> 01:21:42,327
.
and stab down into
the father's chest

1654
01:21:42,327 --> 01:21:44,329
She saw him do it,
the wrong way.

1655
01:21:44,329 --> 01:21:46,581
That's absolutely right.

1656
01:21:46,581 --> 01:21:49,084
Let's talk about
this woman for a moment.

1657
01:21:49,084 --> 01:21:52,587
She said she went to bed
about 11:00 that night.

1658
01:21:52,587 --> 01:21:54,089
Her bed was
next to the window,

1659
01:21:54,089 --> 01:21:56,091
and she could look
out while lying down

1660
01:21:56,091 --> 01:22:00,095
and see directly
into the boy's room
across the street.

1661
01:22:00,095 --> 01:22:02,464
She tossed and
turned for over an hour,
unable to sleep.

1662
01:22:02,964 --> 01:22:06,968
Finally, she turned toward
the window at about 12:10,

1663
01:22:06,968 --> 01:22:09,471
and as she looked out,
she saw the killing

1664
01:22:09,971 --> 01:22:12,474
through the windows
of a passing El train.

1665
01:22:12,474 --> 01:22:14,976
She said the lights went out
immediately after the killing,

1666
01:22:14,976 --> 01:22:20,982
but that she got a good
look at the boy in the act
of stabbing his father.

1667
01:22:20,982 --> 01:22:24,486
As far as I can see it,
this is unshakeable testimony.

1668
01:22:25,487 --> 01:22:27,489
Well, that's the whole case.

1669
01:22:27,489 --> 01:22:28,823
What do you think?

1670
01:22:33,795 --> 01:22:35,296
How about you?

1671
01:22:37,298 --> 01:22:41,302
I don't know.
So much evidence to sift.

1672
01:22:41,803 --> 01:22:43,171
This is a pretty
complicated business.

1673
01:22:43,171 --> 01:22:47,759
Frankly, I don't see
how you can
vote for acquittal.

1674
01:22:47,759 --> 01:22:49,761
It's not so easy to arrang
e all the evidence in order.

1675
01:22:49,761 --> 01:22:51,763
JUROR #3: You can throw out
all the other evidence!

1676
01:22:51,763 --> 01:22:55,767
The woman saw him do it!
What else do you want?

1677
01:22:55,767 --> 01:22:57,769
Well, maybe...
JUROR #8: Let's vote on it.

1678
01:22:57,769 --> 01:23:01,823
JUROR #1: Okay, there's
another vote called for.
Anyone object?

1679
01:23:01,823 --> 01:23:04,993
All right.
I'm changing my vote.
He's guilty.

1680
01:23:04,993 --> 01:23:07,495
Anybody else?
The vote is 8-4.

1681
01:23:07,495 --> 01:23:11,116
?
Why is this such
a personal triumph
for you, this one vote

1682
01:23:11,116 --> 01:23:14,619
Okay. I say we're
a hung jury. I say we
take it in to the judge.

1683
01:23:14,619 --> 01:23:17,622
.
How about it?
I wanna hear arguments

1684
01:23:17,622 --> 01:23:20,592
You, you're the leader
of the cause. What about it?

1685
01:23:22,594 --> 01:23:24,179
.
Let's go over it again

1686
01:23:24,179 --> 01:23:27,932
We've been over it again.
The boy in the gray flanne
l suit here

1687
01:23:27,932 --> 01:23:30,602
is bouncing
backwards and forwards
like a tennis ball.

1688
01:23:30,602 --> 01:23:33,054
There's no point
in getting nasty.

1689
01:23:33,054 --> 01:23:35,557
You keep trying to
turn this into a contest.

1690
01:23:37,058 --> 01:23:38,560
Okay.

1691
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:41,062
.
Maybe we can talk
about setting some
kind of time limit

1692
01:23:41,479 --> 01:23:44,199
Yeah. Once around
for the deal, huh?

1693
01:23:44,699 --> 01:23:50,371
It's 6:15. Someone
before mentioned 7:00.

1694
01:23:50,371 --> 01:23:52,874
I think that's a point
at which we might begin
to discuss the question

1695
01:23:52,874 --> 01:23:55,577
of whether we're
a hung jury or not.

1696
01:23:56,077 --> 01:23:57,745
Don't you feel well?

1697
01:23:58,746 --> 01:24:01,249
I feel perfectly well,
thank you.

1698
01:24:01,249 --> 01:24:03,751
I was saying that 7:00
would be a reasonable time...

1699
01:24:04,252 --> 01:24:08,256
The reason I asked about that
was because you were
rubbing your nose like...

1700
01:24:08,756 --> 01:24:11,259
Oh, I'm sorry
for interrupting.

1701
01:24:11,259 --> 01:24:14,762
But you made a gesture
that reminded me
of something.

1702
01:24:14,762 --> 01:24:16,764
I'm trying to settle
something here. Do you mind?

1703
01:24:16,764 --> 01:24:19,817
Well, I think
this is important.

1704
01:24:19,817 --> 01:24:24,322
Thank you. Now, then,
I'm sure you'll
pardon me for this,

1705
01:24:24,322 --> 01:24:27,825
but I was wondering
why you rub your
nose like that?

1706
01:24:27,825 --> 01:24:29,327
Come on, will you?

1707
01:24:29,327 --> 01:24:33,331
At this point, I happen
to be talking to the gentleman
sitting next to you.

1708
01:24:33,331 --> 01:24:37,202
Now, why were you rubbing
your nose like that?

1709
01:24:37,202 --> 01:24:40,705
If it's any of your business,
I was rubbing it because it
bothers me a little.

1710
01:24:40,705 --> 01:24:42,707
Oh, I'm sorry.

1711
01:24:43,208 --> 01:24:44,709
Is it because of
your eyeglasses?

1712
01:24:45,210 --> 01:24:46,211
It is.

1713
01:24:46,711 --> 01:24:48,179
Now could we get
onto something else?

1714
01:24:48,179 --> 01:24:53,184
Your eyeglasses made those
two deep impressions on
the sides of your nose.

1715
01:24:53,184 --> 01:24:55,186
I hadn't noticed
that before.

1716
01:24:55,186 --> 01:24:57,188
That must be annoying.

1717
01:24:57,188 --> 01:24:59,190
It is very annoying.

1718
01:24:59,190 --> 01:25:00,692
I wouldn't know
about that.

1719
01:25:01,192 --> 01:25:04,696
I've never worn eyeglasses
. 20/20.

1720
01:25:04,696 --> 01:25:08,449
Listen, will you
come on already
with the optometrist bit?

1721
01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:12,453
The woman who testified
that she saw the killing

1722
01:25:12,453 --> 01:25:15,957
had those same marks
on the sides of her nose.

1723
01:25:16,991 --> 01:25:18,993
Holy smokes!
You know, he's right.

1724
01:25:18,993 --> 01:25:24,966
Please.
Just give me a minute,
and I'll be finished.

1725
01:25:24,966 --> 01:25:27,969
I don't know if anyone else
noticed that about her.

1726
01:25:27,969 --> 01:25:33,975
I didn't think of it then,
but I've been going over
her face in my mind.

1727
01:25:34,976 --> 01:25:36,978
She had those same marks.

1728
01:25:37,478 --> 01:25:39,347
She kept rubbing them
in court.

1729
01:25:39,847 --> 01:25:42,150
He's right.
She did do that a lot.

1730
01:25:43,151 --> 01:25:47,655
This woman was
about 45 years old.

1731
01:25:48,156 --> 01:25:52,160
She was making a
tremendous effort to look 35,

1732
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:54,245
for her first
public appearance.

1733
01:25:54,245 --> 01:25:57,749
Heavy make-up. Dyed hair.

1734
01:25:57,749 --> 01:26:01,753
Brand-new clothes that
should have been worn
by a younger woman.

1735
01:26:01,753 --> 01:26:04,672
No glasses.
Well, women do that.

1736
01:26:04,672 --> 01:26:07,542
See if you can get
a mental picture of her.

1737
01:26:07,542 --> 01:26:09,510
What do you mean, no glasses?

1738
01:26:09,510 --> 01:26:11,012
How do you know
whether she wore glasses?

1739
01:26:11,012 --> 01:26:12,764
Just 'cause she
was rubbing her nose?

1740
01:26:12,764 --> 01:26:14,549
She had those marks.
I saw them.

1741
01:26:15,049 --> 01:26:16,551
So what?
What do you think
that means?

1742
01:26:16,551 --> 01:26:18,553
Listen, I'm getting so sic
k of your yelling in here...

1743
01:26:18,553 --> 01:26:19,804
Come on. Forget it.

1744
01:26:19,804 --> 01:26:23,057
.
Hey, listen. Listen,
he's right. I saw them too

1745
01:26:23,558 --> 01:26:26,060
I was the closest one to her.
She had these things
on the side of her nose.

1746
01:26:26,561 --> 01:26:27,695
What do you call those
, on the side?

1747
01:26:27,695 --> 01:26:29,197
What point are
you making here?

1748
01:26:29,697 --> 01:26:33,234
She had dyed hair,
marks on her nose.
What does that mean?

1749
01:26:33,735 --> 01:26:37,705
Could those marks be made
by anything other
than eyeglasses?

1750
01:26:41,075 --> 01:26:43,578
No. They couldn't.

1751
01:26:43,578 --> 01:26:45,580
I didn't see
any marks!

1752
01:26:47,582 --> 01:26:49,083
I did.

1753
01:26:49,083 --> 01:26:51,386
Strange, but I didn't
think about it before.

1754
01:26:51,386 --> 01:26:53,971
What about the lawyer?
Why didn't he say something?

1755
01:26:54,472 --> 01:26:56,974
There are 12 people in here
concentrating on this case.

1756
01:26:56,974 --> 01:26:58,976
11 of us didn't
think of it either.

1757
01:26:58,976 --> 01:27:00,428
What about
the district attorney?

1758
01:27:00,428 --> 01:27:02,430
You think he'd pull
a trick like that?

1759
01:27:02,430 --> 01:27:04,482
Have her testify
without her glasses?

1760
01:27:04,482 --> 01:27:05,983
Did you ever see a woman
who had to wear glasses

1761
01:27:05,983 --> 01:27:08,853
and didn't want to
because she thinks
they spoil her looks?

1762
01:27:08,853 --> 01:27:13,858
Okay, she had marks
on her nose. I'm giving
you that.

1763
01:27:13,858 --> 01:27:15,860
From glasses, right?

1764
01:27:15,860 --> 01:27:20,365
.
She didn't wanna wear them
out of the house so people
would think she's gorgeous

1765
01:27:20,365 --> 01:27:24,869
.
But when she saw this kid
killing his father,
she was in the house alone

1766
01:27:24,869 --> 01:27:27,038
That's all.

1767
01:27:27,038 --> 01:27:28,956
Do you wear glasses
when you go to bed?

1768
01:27:28,956 --> 01:27:30,958
No, I don't.

1769
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:34,462
No one wears
eyeglasses to bed.

1770
01:27:34,962 --> 01:27:36,464
JUROR #8: It's logical
to assume that she wasn't
wearing them

1771
01:27:36,464 --> 01:27:39,267
when she was in bed,
tossing and turning,
trying to fall asleep.

1772
01:27:39,267 --> 01:27:40,351
How do you know?

1773
01:27:40,351 --> 01:27:41,853
I don't know.
I'm guessing.

1774
01:27:41,853 --> 01:27:44,355
I'm also guessing that
she probably didn't
put her glasses on

1775
01:27:44,856 --> 01:27:46,357
.
when she turned and looked
casually out of the window

1776
01:27:46,357 --> 01:27:49,861
And she herself testified
the killing took place
just as she looked out.

1777
01:27:49,861 --> 01:27:51,362
The lights went off
a split-second later.

1778
01:27:51,362 --> 01:27:52,864
She couldn't have had
time to put them on then.

1779
01:27:52,864 --> 01:27:54,365
Wait a second...
Here's another guess.

1780
01:27:54,365 --> 01:27:56,868
Maybe she honestly
thought she saw
the boy kill his father.

1781
01:27:56,868 --> 01:27:58,369
I say she only saw a blur.

1782
01:27:58,369 --> 01:28:02,573
How do you know what she saw?
How does he know all that?

1783
01:28:02,573 --> 01:28:05,076
!
How do you know what kind
of glasses she wore?
Maybe they were sunglasses

1784
01:28:05,076 --> 01:28:07,829
?
Maybe she was far-sighted!
What do you know about her

1785
01:28:08,329 --> 01:28:11,215
I only know
the woman's eyesight
is in question now.

1786
01:28:11,215 --> 01:28:16,971
She had to be able to identify
a person 60 feet away,
at night, without glasses.

1787
01:28:17,388 --> 01:28:20,341
You can't send
someone off to die
on evidence like that.

1788
01:28:20,341 --> 01:28:22,226
.
Don't give me that

1789
01:28:22,226 --> 01:28:24,178
Don't you think the woman
might have made a mistake?

1790
01:28:24,178 --> 01:28:25,146
No.

1791
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:26,681
It's not possible?

1792
01:28:26,681 --> 01:28:27,982
No, it's not possible.

1793
01:28:31,352 --> 01:28:32,854
Is it possible?

1794
01:28:34,355 --> 01:28:35,857
Not guilty.

1795
01:28:40,361 --> 01:28:42,363
Do you think
he's guilty?

1796
01:28:42,864 --> 01:28:44,866
I think he's guilty.

1797
01:28:47,869 --> 01:28:48,870
Do you?

1798
01:28:52,373 --> 01:28:53,875
No.

1799
01:28:53,875 --> 01:28:56,878
I'm convinced. Not guilty.

1800
01:28:56,878 --> 01:28:58,880
?
What's the matter with you

1801
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,882
I have a reasonable
doubt now.

1802
01:29:00,882 --> 01:29:02,467
.
It's 11 to one

1803
01:29:02,467 --> 01:29:05,470
What about all
the other evidence?
What about all that stuff?

1804
01:29:05,470 --> 01:29:07,438
?
The knife?
The whole business

1805
01:29:07,939 --> 01:29:11,442
Well, you said we could
throw out all
the other evidence.

1806
01:29:16,697 --> 01:29:18,566
JUROR #7: Well,
what do we do now?

1807
01:29:21,569 --> 01:29:23,788
You're alone.

1808
01:29:23,788 --> 01:29:26,791
I don't care whether
I'm alone or not.
It's my right.

1809
01:29:30,661 --> 01:29:32,046
It's your right.

1810
01:29:41,973 --> 01:29:44,559
Well, what do you want?
I say he's guilty.

1811
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:47,228
We want to hear
your arguments.

1812
01:29:47,728 --> 01:29:49,230
I gave you my arguments.

1813
01:29:49,981 --> 01:29:51,983
We're not convinced.

1814

.
We want to hear them again

1815
01:29:55,236 --> 01:29:57,522
We have as much
time as it takes.

1816
01:30:03,027 --> 01:30:07,532
Everything. Every single
thing that took place
in that courtroom,

1817
01:30:07,532 --> 01:30:09,534
but I mean everything,
says he's guilty.

1818
01:30:09,534 --> 01:30:11,836
What do you think?
I'm an idiot or something?

1819
01:30:13,337 --> 01:30:15,339
Why don't you take that stuff
about the old man.

1820
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:18,843
The old man who lived there
and heard everything!

1821
01:30:20,344 --> 01:30:21,846
Or this business
about the knife.

1822
01:30:21,846 --> 01:30:24,348
What? 'Cause he found
another one exactly like it?

1823
01:30:24,348 --> 01:30:27,852
The old man saw him!
Right there, on the stairs.

1824
01:30:27,852 --> 01:30:30,855
What's the difference
how many seconds it was?

1825
01:30:31,856 --> 01:30:33,357
Every single thing.

1826
01:30:35,359 --> 01:30:38,362
The knife falling through
a hole in his pocket.

1827
01:30:38,362 --> 01:30:41,866
You can't prove he
didn't get to the door!

1828
01:30:41,866 --> 01:30:44,368
Sure, you can take all
the time, hobble around
the room,

1829
01:30:44,368 --> 01:30:46,370
but you can't prove it!

1830
01:30:49,290 --> 01:30:52,793
And what about this
business of the El?
And the movies?

1831
01:30:52,793 --> 01:30:55,796
There's a phony deal
if I ever heard one.

1832
01:30:55,796 --> 01:30:59,800
I'll bet you $5,000
I'd remember
the movies I saw.

1833
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:05,806
I'm telling you,
everything that's gone on
has been twisted and turned!

1834
01:31:06,307 --> 01:31:09,727
This business with
the glasses? How do you know
she didn't have them on?

1835
01:31:09,727 --> 01:31:12,730
This woman testified
in open court!

1836
01:31:14,231 --> 01:31:17,735
And what about hearing
the kid yell? Huh?

1837
01:31:18,235 --> 01:31:21,238
I'm telling you,
I've got all the facts here.

Well, that's it.
That's the whole case.

01:31:36,537 --> 01:31:37,538
Well?
