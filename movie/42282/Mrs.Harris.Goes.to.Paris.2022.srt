你想对她好点。

138
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:13,147
她只是去赢了台球而已。
She's only gone and won the pools.

139
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:19,721
艾达，你打算怎么办?

我打算买条裙子。

单身,紫小姐吗?

149
00:15:57,024 --> 00:16:00,695
嗯哼。没人给我收拾残局。

150
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,399
——啊。早上,纽康比先生。
-Ah. -Morning, Mr. Newcombe.

Mrs. Harris, I, uh... I don't believe you've met my niece, Samantha.

嗯,纽康比先生。
Um, Mr. Newcombe.

如果你知道有谁需要我的帮助…也许是你的一个侄女?
If you know of anyone who could use me services-- um... one of your nieces, perhaps?

155
00:16:20,214 --> 00:16:22,684
萨曼莎，H夫人是谨慎的灵魂。
Samantha, Mrs. H is the soul of discretion.

156
00:16:22,717 --> 00:16:25,787
要不是我把手上的指甲油，谁也不会知道她来过。
One would never know she'd been but for the polish on my knobs.

157
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,021

试镜的事很抱歉，亲爱的。
Sorry about the audition, love.

161
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:11,893
我不知道我为什么要麻烦你。
Oh, I don't know why I bother.

162
00:18:11,926 --> 00:18:14,494
“太年轻”。“太老了”。

163
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:16,831
“太高了”。“太胖。”

164
00:18:16,864 --> 00:18:18,600
你们说得很对，宝贝儿。
You're just right, ducks.

165
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:21,201
我二十岁……三。
I'm twenty... three.

166
00:18:21,903 --> 00:18:23,838
再过几年，我就完了。

哦，你有足够的时间。
Oh, you've plenty of time.

168

你无法想象那是什么感觉，哈里斯太太，总是要担心自己的长相。
You can't imagine what it's like, Mrs. Harris, always having to worry about your looks.

169
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:38,519
灰姑娘，你为什么给他们带破布?
Hey, Cinderella, why'd you bring them rags?

170
00:18:38,553 --> 00:18:42,657
我要去参加舞会……当我买衣服的时候。
I will go to the ball... when I get me dress.

171

哦，麻烦来了。
Oh, here comes trouble with a capital "A."

172

你好,阿奇。
Hello, Archie.

173
00:18:46,527 --> 00:18:48,495
艾达，就是我要找的女孩。
Ada, the very girl I was after.

174
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:50,430
我能为你做什么，鸭子?-别让我激动。
-What can I do for you, ducks? -Now, don't get me excited.

175
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:51,866
你知道我心脏有问题。
You know I've got a dodgy ticker.

176
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:53,300
哦，去你的。
Oh, get away with you.

177
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,737
她的计划比你大。
She got bigger plans than you.

178
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,170
我看得出来。
I can see that.

179
00:18:57,204 --> 00:19:00,541
那么，你能帮我照看一下春天和夏天吗?
So, would you mind doing me a favor and look after Spring and Summer?

180
00:19:00,575 --> 00:19:05,245
因为辛西娅，她不是狗最好的朋友。
Because Cynthia there's not exactly a dog's best friend.

181
00:19:07,949 --> 00:19:09,449
继续。
Go on.

182
00:19:10,985 --> 00:19:13,186
谢谢你！

187
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:27,702
这就是我们，维。

188
00:19:27,735 --> 00:19:28,970
看不见的女人。
The invisible women.

189
00:19:29,003 --> 00:19:30,538
为自己说话。
Speak for yourself.

00:19:31,773 --> 00:19:33,975
他们看到我来了。
They see me coming. ♪ Mm! ♪

191
00:19:42,684 --> 00:19:43,685
噢!
Oh!

192
00:19:43,718 --> 00:19:45,787
对不起，小姐。
Beg your pardon, milady.

193
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:52,527
夫人，这是我的账户。
Milady, um, my account.

194
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,829
我想知道你能不能结账。
I was wondering if you might settle up.

195
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:56,898
哦，很抱歉，哈里斯太太。
Oh, I'm so sorry, Mrs. Harris.

196
00:19:56,931 --> 00:19:58,866
恐怕我忘了去趟银行了。
I'm afraid I forgot to pop to the bank.

197
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,367
这场婚礼简直是场噩梦。
This wedding is a nightmare.

198
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,770
每个人都同意了。
Everybody has said yes.

199
00:20:02,804 --> 00:20:07,240
哦,嗯…你不会介意等到下个星期吧?
Oh, um... you wouldn't mind waiting until next week, would you?

200
00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:14,649
嗯，呃，事情是这样的，事情有点紧迫，因为我需要…哦，时间到了吗?
Well, uh, the thing is, it's become a bit pressing because I need to... Oh, is that the time?

201
00:20:14,682 --> 00:20:19,520
事实上，哈里斯太太，恐怕我得减少你的工作时间了。
Actually, Mrs. Harris, I'm afraid I'm going to have to reduce your hours.

202
00:20:19,554 --> 00:20:24,692
减少?请n不。夫人,请…现在我们都得节约，不是吗?
Reduce? N-No, please. Milady, please... Well, we all have to economize these days, don't we?

203
00:20:24,726 --> 00:20:25,827
对不起。
Sorry.

204
00:21:13,808 --> 00:21:17,645
我知道你在那里，女人，在黑暗和寒冷中。
I know you're there, woman, in the dark and cold.

205
00:21:20,114 --> 00:21:22,850
我没事，小维。
I'm all right, Vi.

206
00:21:24,585 --> 00:21:27,588
阿奇让我们自由进入白城了。
Archie has got us free into White City.

207
00:21:27,622 --> 00:21:29,389
哦，不，我还得补呢。
Oh, no, I've got all this mending.

208
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:31,859
-Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah。n不。不,不,六世。
-Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah. -N-No. No, no, Vi.

209
00:21:31,893 --> 00:21:33,326
6哦。
Vi... Oh.

210
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,062
给我们找点乐子。
Have us a bit of fun.

211
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:00,688
哦,上帝。看。
Oh, good Lord. Look.

212
00:22:00,721 --> 00:22:02,056
这是一个信号。
It's a sign.

213
00:22:02,089 --> 00:22:03,825
你有好小费吗?
You got a good tip?

214
00:22:03,858 --> 00:22:05,358
是啊!
Yeah!

215
00:22:05,392 --> 00:22:07,094
是的,我有!
Yeah, I have!

216
00:22:07,128 --> 00:22:10,097
——嗯…excu……借口……-嗨。
- Um... excu... excuse... - Hey.

217
00:22:10,131 --> 00:22:12,834
原谅我。-艾达，你想赌一把吗?
-Excuse me. -Ada, you fancy a flutter?

218
00:22:12,867 --> 00:22:15,335
-是的。什么会呢?
-Yeah. -What'll it be?

219
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:19,874
100英镑赌6号。
100 quid on number six.

220
00:22:21,843 --> 00:22:23,644
赢。
To win.

221
00:22:23,678 --> 00:22:24,846
一吨?
A ton?

222
00:22:24,879 --> 00:22:27,114
看在麦克的份上，艾达，不，把它收起来。
For the love of Mike, Ada, no, put it away.

223
00:22:27,148 --> 00:22:29,550
没有。6号。
No. Number six.

224
00:22:29,584 --> 00:22:31,886
请高级时装。-狗是一袋骨头。
-Haute Couture, please. -The dog's a bag of bones.

225
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,988
它屁股上插着火箭是赢不了的。
It couldn't win with a rocket up its arse.

226
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:35,455
你告诉她，阿奇。
You tell her, Archie.

227
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:36,991
她疯了。
She's lost her marbles.

228
00:22:37,024 --> 00:22:38,759
不，这是高级时装。
No, it's Haute Couture.

229
00:22:38,793 --> 00:22:40,628
这是一个信号。怎么可能是别的呢?
It's a sign. How could it be anything else?

230
00:22:40,661 --> 00:22:42,864
艾达，姑娘，我干这行很久了，好吗?
Ada, girl, I've been doing this a long time, all right?

231
00:22:42,897 --> 00:22:44,165
征兆不能赢得比赛。
Signs don't win races.

232
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:46,868
直到今晚，他们才知道。
Not till tonight, they didn't.

233
00:22:49,704 --> 00:22:51,138
我的钱很好。
My money's good.

234
00:22:51,172 --> 00:22:53,774
算,请。
Count it, please.

235
00:22:56,443 --> 00:22:58,679
是的。
Yeah.

236
00:23:06,187 --> 00:23:08,022
这里。
Here.

237
00:23:08,055 --> 00:23:10,423
我们开始吧。这很好。
Here we go. That's good.

238
00:23:10,457 --> 00:23:12,793
哦，我们有个好地方。正确的。
Oh, we got a good spot. Right.

239
00:23:20,201 --> 00:23:22,536
哦。祝我好运吧。
Oh. Wish me luck.

240
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,506
-哦,艾达。-来吧，高级时装。
-Oh, Ada. -Come on, Haute Couture.

241
00:23:35,783 --> 00:23:38,185
哦，看，她领先了!
Oh, look, she's in the lead!

242
00:23:38,219 --> 00:23:39,654
来吧!
Come on!

243
00:23:40,955 --> 00:23:42,790
这是在前面。
It's in front.

244
00:23:42,823 --> 00:23:44,926
来吧!
Come on!

245
00:24:06,747 --> 00:24:11,085
是聪明伯爵，蓝条纹和暴风湾。
It's Clever Count, Blue Streak, and Stormy Bay.

246
00:24:11,118 --> 00:24:16,123
你看，高级定制刚醒过来记起她来这里的目的。
And would you look at that-- Haute Couture has just woken up and remembered what she's here for.

247
00:24:29,971 --> 00:24:34,108
嗯…向你脱帽致敬，姑娘。
Well... Hats off to you, girl.

248
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:36,010
你大胆尝试了。
You went for it.

249
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:38,980
我去找圣约翰救护车。
I'll go find a St John's Ambulance.

250
00:24:39,013 --> 00:24:40,915
他们可能喝了很多白兰地。
They might have a tot of brandy.

251
00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:43,584
给我。
For me.

252
00:24:43,617 --> 00:24:46,454
你说得对，维，那些钱。
You were right, Vi-- all that money.

253
00:24:47,588 --> 00:24:49,824
我的艾迪会为我感到羞耻的。
My Eddie'd be ashamed of me.

254
00:24:51,025 --> 00:24:53,027
我马上回来，好吗?
I'll be right back, huh?

255
00:24:57,631 --> 00:25:00,935
做梦没有错，艾达?
Nothing wrong with dreaming, Ada, hmm?

256
00:25:00,968 --> 00:25:05,506
当我来到伦敦时，街道上铺满了我的梦想。
When I came to London, the streets were paved with my dreams.

257
00:25:10,778 --> 00:25:13,247
这就是你。
That's what you are.

258
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,583
你是一个梦想家。
You're a dreamer.

259
00:25:15,616 --> 00:25:17,785
就像你脸上的鼻子一样清楚。
Plain as the nose on your face.

260
00:25:51,886 --> 00:25:55,623
算了吧，小维，我没事。
Give over, Vi. I'm all right.

261
00:25:55,656 --> 00:25:57,258
哈里斯太太吗?
Mrs. Harris?

262
00:25:57,291 --> 00:25:59,360
爱德华·哈里斯夫人?
Mrs. Edward Harris?

263
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:01,629
是关于你丈夫的。
It's about your husband.

264
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:05,633
请坐下。
Sit down, please.

265
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,838
哈里斯中士直到4月19日才被宣布失踪。
Sergeant Harris wasn't declared missing in action until April the 19th.

266
00:26:10,871 --> 00:26:13,074
是的，我就是那时收到电报的。
Uh, yeah, that's when I got the telegram.

267
00:26:13,107 --> 00:26:15,209
这是他生日的第二天。
It's a day after his birthday.

268
00:26:15,242 --> 00:26:17,344
啊,是的。
Ah, yes.

269
00:26:17,378 --> 00:26:30,991
据我们所知，波罗利马326号航班在1944年3月2日坠毁，这意味着哈里斯中士在他死后的近七周内都有工资。
Well, um, as we now know, Flight Polo Lima 326 crashed on March the 2nd, 1944, meaning that Sergeant Harris was paid for almost seven weeks after his death.

270
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:35,329
一天六先令。
At, um, six shillings a day.

271
00:26:35,362 --> 00:26:38,099
你来就是要告诉我这个吗?
Is that what you come to tell me?

272
00:26:38,132 --> 00:26:40,601
经过了这么久。
After all this time.

273
00:26:41,268 --> 00:26:42,937
我的艾迪欠你工资?
That my Eddie owes you back pay?

274
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,972
他这辈子从没欠过一分钱。
When he never owed a penny in his life.

275
00:26:45,005 --> 00:26:47,408
当他为国王和国家放弃生命的时候。
When he give up his life for king and country.

276
00:26:47,441 --> 00:26:48,976
你胆子真大。
You got a nerve.

277
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:52,146
来我家，喝我的茶，抹黑他的名声。
Coming into my home, drinking my tea, blackening his name.

278
00:26:52,179 --> 00:26:54,381
-恩……-你要多少钱?
-Um... -How much do you want?

279
00:26:54,415 --> 00:26:56,050
多少钱?然后你就可以走了。
How much? And then you can leave.

280
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:57,818
我觉得你想错了。
I-I think you've got the wrong end of the stick.

281
00:26:57,852 --> 00:27:04,692
哦,我吗?好吧，我马上就会告诉你你把棍子塞到哪里去，如果你不小心的话。-哦,天啊,没有。嗯,我,嗯…我是来给你钱的，哈里斯太太，
Oh, have I? Well, I'll tell you where you can shove your stick in a minute, -if you don't watch out. -Oh, golly, no. Um, I, uh... I'm here to give you money, Mrs. Harris,

282
00:27:04,725 --> 00:27:08,929
-不是要从你那里拿走。-我受够了…你想说什么?
-not-not to take it from you. -I've had enough of... What'd you say?

283
00:27:08,963 --> 00:27:10,998
等号左边。好。
Y-Yes. Righto.

284
00:27:11,031 --> 00:27:16,237
你应该从1944年就开始领取战争遗孀的抚恤金。
Uh, you should have been receiving a-a war widow's pension since 1944.

285
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:20,107
算上那一点扣除额，这笔钱可真不少。
It comes to quite a tidy sum, uh, with that small deduction.

286
00:27:20,975 --> 00:27:23,144
只要你没有再婚。
So long as you haven't remarried.

287
00:27:23,177 --> 00:27:24,879
哦,给结束了。
Oh, give over.

288
00:27:24,912 --> 00:27:28,249
他随时都可能回来，我就会像个十足的查理。
He might have come back any minute, I'd have looked a right Charlie.

289
00:27:28,282 --> 00:27:32,686
嗯…嗯…
Uh... well...

290
00:27:34,722 --> 00:27:37,658
我想你最好坐下来。
I suppose you'd better sit down.

291
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:40,261
还是喝杯茶吧。
Have that cup of tea after all.

292
00:27:40,294 --> 00:27:42,296
嗯,没有牛奶。
Um, no milk.

293
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:45,432
她这辈子从没做过坏事，先生。
She's never done a thing wrong her whole life, sir.

294
00:27:45,466 --> 00:27:50,037
她因为一件衣服有点发疯，但现在没事了。
She went a bit crazy on account of some dress, but she's fine now.

295
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,206
没什么好担心的。
Nothing to worry about.

296
00:27:57,344 --> 00:27:59,180
——哦,你好。-哈里斯太太?
- Oh, hello. - Mrs. Harris?

297
00:27:59,213 --> 00:28:01,315
你是来告诉我我拿到王冠了吗?
You come to tell me I got the crown jewels?

298
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:02,850
她还是神志不清。
She's still not right in the head.

299
00:28:02,883 --> 00:28:09,356
几乎。你交上来的那个钻石夹子，它的主人想奖励你做一个诚实的公民。
Almost. That diamond clip you handed in-- the owner wants to give you a reward for being an honest citizen.

300
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:12,726
噢!先生，她太诚实了。
Oh! She is, sir, honest to a fault.

301
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,328
进来喝杯茶吧。
Come in and have a cup of tea.

302
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:15,930
请不要介意。谢谢你！
Don't mind if I do. Thank you.

303
00:28:15,963 --> 00:28:17,464
来吧，维，我们可以搞个聚会。
Oh, come on, Vi. We can have a knees-up.

304
00:28:17,498 --> 00:28:18,999
喂，等等我。
Oi, wait for me.

305
00:28:19,033 --> 00:28:21,402
还有，你最好把香槟开了。
And, uh, you might want to break out the bubbly.

306
00:28:21,435 --> 00:28:23,103
你今天又走运了吗，阿奇?
You having another lucky day, Archie?

307
00:28:23,137 --> 00:28:25,239
事实上，我是，你也是。
As a matter of fact, I am, and so are you.

308
00:28:25,272 --> 00:28:26,974
消息传的很快。
News travels fast.

309
00:28:27,007 --> 00:28:31,478
所以，你赌那条两条腿的狗…哦,y-yeah,不要…别担心那个。
So, that bet you put on that two-legged dog... Oh, y-yeah, don't... don't worry about that.

310
00:28:31,513 --> 00:28:32,980
我恢复理智了。
I've come to me senses.

311
00:28:33,013 --> 00:28:38,018
没有，老板在那里，所以我不得不拿钱，但我设法保留了10英镑。
No, the boss was there, so I had to take the money, but I managed to hold back a tenner.

312
00:28:38,052 --> 00:28:39,987
你不该那么做，阿奇。
You shouldn't have done that, Archie.

313
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,488
你会惹上麻烦的。
You could have got into trouble.

314
00:28:41,523 --> 00:28:43,290
没问题吧，哈里斯太太?
All tickety-boo, Mrs. Harris?

315
00:28:44,491 --> 00:28:46,528
哦，对不起，我不知道你有客人。
Oh, sorry, I didn't realize you had company.

316
00:28:46,561 --> 00:28:48,963
你好。这是怎么回事?
Hello. What's going on here?

317
00:28:48,996 --> 00:28:50,364
——哦。-看在麦克的份上
- Oh. - For the love of Mike.

318
00:28:50,397 --> 00:28:52,933
-回头见-不，阿奇，阿奇
- Uh, I'll see you later. - Uh, no, Archie, Archie.

319
00:28:52,967 --> 00:28:54,502
能给我点时间吗?
Uh, can you just give me a moment?

320
00:28:54,536 --> 00:28:56,370
它的个人。
It-it's personal.

321
00:28:56,403 --> 00:28:58,739
-水壶响了?——啊,好。
-That the kettle calling? -Ah, righto.

322
00:29:00,508 --> 00:29:02,343
这是怎么呢的东西了?
What's going on? Something up?

323
00:29:02,376 --> 00:29:03,811
说来话长。
It's a long story.

324
00:29:03,844 --> 00:29:04,912
你刚才说什么?
What were you saying?

325
00:29:04,945 --> 00:29:08,983
所以，我拿了你的钱，把赌注压在了上一场比赛上。
So, I took your money and put it on a sure thing in the last race.

326
00:29:09,016 --> 00:29:14,755
和,嗯……把木桩拿回来，再多拿一点。
And, um... ... your stake back and a wee bit more.

327
00:29:15,956 --> 00:29:18,125
不，阿奇，我不能。
Oh, n-no, Archie, I couldn't.

328
00:29:18,158 --> 00:29:20,928
-我…-你的钱。把它。
-I... -It's your money. Take it.

329
00:29:20,961 --> 00:29:22,396
我不能留着它，女人。
I can't keep it, woman.

330
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:25,032
那里的PC Plod会有我的执照。来吧。
PC Plod in there would have my license. Come on.

331
00:29:28,302 --> 00:29:31,038
答应我在军团酒吧跳支舞。
Just promise me a dance at the Legion.

332
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:36,410
谢谢你,阿奇。
Thanks, Archie.

333
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:38,145
感谢。
Much obliged.

334
00:29:43,284 --> 00:29:44,385
啊呀。
Blimey.

335
00:30:03,237 --> 00:30:04,838
我们飞行吗?
Are we flying?

336
00:30:06,106 --> 00:30:08,576
女士们先生们，我们非常抱歉。
We're terribly sorry, ladies and gentlemen.

337
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,612
好像有一个引擎有毛病。
There seems to be a fault with one engine.

338
00:30:10,645 --> 00:30:14,315
在我们试图解决这个问题时，将会有轻微的延迟。
There will be a slight delay while we try and fix the problem.

339
00:30:14,348 --> 00:30:16,150
延迟?
Delay?

340
00:30:16,183 --> 00:30:18,018
多久?
How long?

341
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:21,822
我得在一天内往返。
I've got to be there and back in a day.

342
00:30:35,102 --> 00:30:37,371
哦,上帝。
Oh, God.

343
00:30:43,177 --> 00:30:44,378
巴黎。
Paris.

344
00:31:10,037 --> 00:31:12,406
好了，巴黎，我来了。
Righto, Paris, here I come.

345
00:31:16,644 --> 00:31:19,079
这是一条很长的路。
It's a fair old walk.

346
00:31:47,709 --> 00:31:51,513
哦。嗯…你好。
Oh. Um... bonjour.

347
00:31:53,046 --> 00:31:54,582
请求你的原谅吗?
Beg your pardon?

348
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,320
嘿。
Hey.

349
00:32:01,589 --> 00:32:04,124
谢谢你！是的。
Thank you. Yeah.

350
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:10,297
我是来买裙子的。
Um, I'm here to buy a dress.

351
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:11,432
迪奥。
From Dior.

352
00:32:11,465 --> 00:32:13,033
迪奥吗?
Dior?

353
00:32:13,066 --> 00:32:15,402
啊,是的。我也。
Ah, oui. Me also.

354
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:21,576
离迪奥远吗?
Is it far-- Dior?

355
00:32:21,609 --> 00:32:25,045
哦……20分钟。
Oh... 20 minutes.

356
00:32:25,078 --> 00:32:27,981
但你喝完酒，两小时后。
Uh, but after you take wine, two hours.

357
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,187
我陪你去。
I walk you there.

358
00:32:34,221 --> 00:32:37,024
明天早上,是吗?
Tomorrow morning, eh?

359
00:32:40,394 --> 00:32:41,428
哦，不，不，谢谢。
Oh, no, no, thanks.

360
00:32:41,462 --> 00:32:43,430
不,我不能。
I couldn't, no.

361
00:32:47,769 --> 00:32:50,304
好吧，接着说。
All right, go on, then.

362
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:57,645
哦,天哪。
Oh, blimey.

363
00:33:14,194 --> 00:33:16,764
为什么街上有这么多垃圾?
Why is all this rubbish on the streets?

364
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:22,002
大老板作弊……——工人,是吗?-是的,是的。
The big boss cheats... -The worker, yes? -Yeah, yeah.

365
00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:26,006
工人说:“没有了。”
The worker say, "No more."

366
00:33:27,809 --> 00:33:29,443
清洁工罢工了?
The binmen are on strike?

367
00:33:29,476 --> 00:33:31,278
啊,是的。
Ah, yes.

368
00:33:31,311 --> 00:33:36,250
现在整个巴黎，呃，闻起来，呃... ...嗯,喜欢我。
Now all Paris, uh, smells, uh... ...uh, like me.

369
00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:43,290
哦,上帝。
Oh, God.

370
00:33:46,594 --> 00:33:49,062
你是一个高尚的女人。
You are a noble woman.

371
00:33:49,096 --> 00:33:52,767
记住，在法国，工人就是国王。
And remember, in France, the worker is king.

372
00:34:12,319 --> 00:34:14,154
哦,小姐!
Oh, miss!

373
00:34:15,155 --> 00:34:16,624
你没事吧，亲爱的?
You all right, love?

374
00:34:19,259 --> 00:34:20,728
-你受伤了吗?-不。对不起。
-Did you hurt yourself? -No. Sorry.

375
00:34:20,762 --> 00:34:21,796
谢谢你！

376
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:23,831
——你确定吗?-是的。
-Are you sure? -Yes.

377
00:34:23,865 --> 00:34:25,567
哦。
Oh.

378
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,100
小姐?
Miss?

379
00:34:27,735 --> 00:34:29,469
小姐!
Miss!

380
00:34:39,246 --> 00:34:41,381
没有,小姐。
No, miss.

381
00:34:41,415 --> 00:34:43,083
奥奥!小姐!
Ooh-ooh! Miss!

382
00:34:43,685 --> 00:34:44,686
小姐?
Miss?

383
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,688
给你。
Here you go.

384
00:34:46,721 --> 00:34:48,188
又一次，你救了我，夫人。
Once again, you save me, madame.

385
00:34:48,221 --> 00:34:49,891
——哦。——我很抱歉。我很晚。
- Oh. - I'm sorry. I'm very late.

386
00:34:49,924 --> 00:34:51,593
-哦。-谢谢。
-Oh. -Thank you.

387
00:34:51,626 --> 00:34:53,861
没关系。只要你没事就行。
It's all right. As long as you're in one piece.

388
00:34:55,563 --> 00:34:57,097
哦。
Ooh.

389
00:35:08,643 --> 00:35:10,344
哦,嗯…
Ooh, uh...

390
00:35:29,797 --> 00:35:32,232
哦。对不起,亲爱的。
Oh. Excuse me, dear.

391
00:35:32,265 --> 00:35:35,302
我在哪里可以找到连衣裙?
Where would I find the frocks?

392
00:35:35,335 --> 00:35:37,404
恐怕您取错地址了，夫人。
I fear you have the wrong address, madame.

393
00:35:37,437 --> 00:35:39,272
我会叫人给你带路。
I will call someone to show you the way.

394
00:35:39,306 --> 00:35:40,541
没有。不,不。
No. No, no.

395
00:35:40,575 --> 00:35:42,376
对不起。我——我……我想买一件连衣裙。
Sorry. I'm-I'm... I'm after a frock.

396
00:35:42,409 --> 00:35:44,244
其中一个500磅重。
One of them 500-pound ones.

397
00:35:44,277 --> 00:35:48,215
请您在这边等一下，马上会有人来接待您的。
Please, if you could wait over here, somebody will attend you directly.

398
00:36:01,328 --> 00:36:02,764
现在,坚持下去。原谅我。
Now, hang on. Excuse me.

399
00:36:02,797 --> 00:36:06,199
夫人，我是第一个来的，在这些人出现之前。
Madame, I-I was here first, before any of this lot.

400
00:36:06,233 --> 00:36:08,435
你没听说过排队吗?
Ain't you heard of queuing?

401
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:15,409
对不起。看,我很抱歉。
Excuse me. Look, I'm sorry.

402
00:36:15,442 --> 00:36:20,848

-Please. -I'm-I'm... I'm not one to make a fuss, but where I come from, shopgirls are pleased to be of service.

403
00:36:20,882 --> 00:36:23,216
女店员吗?
Shopgirls?

404
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:28,690
这位女士想买一件衣服。

00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,395
让我送你出去吧。
Uh, please let me escort you out.

408
00:36:35,429 --> 00:36:37,565
不，不，不，不，等一下。
No, no, no, no, no, hang on a minute.

409
00:36:37,598 --> 00:36:39,266
我已经英里。
I've come miles.

410
00:36:39,299 --> 00:36:42,970
擦地板时省下的每一分钱我都不知道是为了买这件衣服。
Saved every penny scrubbing floors and I don't know what so I can buy this frock.

411
00:36:43,004 --> 00:36:45,506
一件克里斯汀·迪奥(Christian Dior)的礼服可不贵。
A Christian Dior gown is not for pennies.

412
00:36:47,441 --> 00:36:49,342
正确的。
Right.

413
00:36:50,611 --> 00:36:54,816
如果你觉得我没钱…在那里。
If you think I ain't got the money... there.

414
00:36:54,849 --> 00:36:56,383
哦拉l。
Oh là l.

415
00:36:59,887 --> 00:37:01,455
你是迪奥先生吗?
Are you Mr. Dior?

416
00:37:01,488 --> 00:37:03,725
不，我是财务部的福维尔先生。
Oh, oh, no, I'm Mr. Fauvel, accounts.

417
00:37:03,758 --> 00:37:05,492
让我来帮你……
Let me help you with the...

不好意思，chère女士，但如果您能作为我的客人来参观藏品将是我的荣幸。
Excuse me, chère madame, but it would be my honor to have you view the collection as my guest.

419
00:37:18,873 --> 00:37:20,474
你就在那里。

420
00:37:21,876 --> 00:37:23,611
谢谢。

424
00:38:00,815 --> 00:38:02,449
谢谢你！
Thank you.

425
00:38:24,371 --> 00:38:28,943
当你看到你想要的裙子时，你可以把号码写在这里。
When you see the dress you want, you can write the number down here.

426
00:38:28,976 --> 00:38:31,444
哦。
Oh.

427
00:38:39,419 --> 00:38:41,856
我只是在欣赏你的扣眼。
Oh, I was just admiring your buttonhole.

428
00:38:41,889 --> 00:38:42,957
哦。
Oh.

429
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,959
-路易斯调研。——啊?

430
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,694
是的,它是可爱的。适当的气味。
Yes, it's lovely. Proper scent.

431
00:38:46,727 --> 00:38:48,629
你是玫瑰鉴赏家吗?
Are you a connoisseur of roses?

432
00:38:48,663 --> 00:38:52,365
我丈夫埃迪在科文特花园的花市工作。
My husband Eddie worked at Covent Garden, the flower market.

433
00:38:52,399 --> 00:38:55,002
你知道，他总是带些零零碎碎的东西回家。
He was always bringing home odds and ends, you know.

434
00:38:55,036 --> 00:38:57,505
玫瑰是我的最爱。
Roses are me favorite.

435
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,009
你想给你老婆买条裙子吗?

436
00:39:02,043 --> 00:39:04,377
哦。幸运的女人。

438
00:39:07,114 --> 00:39:08,983
哦，请原谅，先生。

439
00:39:09,016 --> 00:39:10,751
我笨拙的木屐。
My clumsy clogs.

440
00:39:11,819 --> 00:39:13,654
我的艾迪和所有人。
My Eddie and all.

441
00:39:13,688 --> 00:39:19,727
哦,嗯…但是的，我和我妻子会一起来。
Oh, um... But yes, uh, my wife and I would come here together.

442
00:39:20,528 --> 00:39:22,530
我喜欢看漂亮的衣服。
I like to see beautiful clothes.

443
00:39:22,563 --> 00:39:24,732
当然还有美女。
And beautiful women, of course.

444
00:40:03,804 --> 00:40:06,207
哦，又来了。
Oh, here we go.

445
00:40:22,023 --> 00:40:23,824

什么号码的?-73年。

452
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:25,579
金星。是的。-73年。金星。

00:43:30,077 --> 00:43:32,012
哦,是的。

456
00:44:34,241 --> 00:44:36,076
万岁!
Bravo!

457
00:44:37,044 --> 00:44:38,312
那个家伙是谁?
Who's that bloke?

458
00:44:38,345 --> 00:44:41,248
那是大师本人，迪奥先生。
Well, that's the master himself, Monsieur Dior.

459
00:44:41,282 --> 00:44:42,783
继续。
Go on.

460
00:44:45,886 --> 00:44:49,089
他看起来像我的送奶工。
He looks like my milkman.

461
00:44:55,162 --> 00:44:56,497
祝你好运，夫人。
Well, good luck, madame.

462
00:44:56,531 --> 00:44:58,332
我希望你能找到你想要的。
I hope you find what you're looking for.

463
00:44:58,365 --> 00:45:03,938
哦,好吧…这里。
Oh, well... Here.

464
00:45:08,309 --> 00:45:10,244
你不想留着它吗?
You do not wish to keep it?

465
00:45:11,111 --> 00:45:14,114
是的,这是可爱的没办法。谢谢你！
Yeah, it's-it's lovely. Thank you.

466
00:45:15,115 --> 00:45:16,884
很高兴认识你。
Enchanté.

467
00:45:22,156 --> 00:45:24,024
我不介意。
Don't mind me.

468
00:45:26,827 --> 00:45:28,362
是的,夫人?-哦。
-Yes, madame? -Oh.

469
00:45:28,395 --> 00:45:30,130
你选好了吗?
Have you made your selection?

470
00:45:30,164 --> 00:45:35,402
是的。嗯…请89号。诱惑。
Yes. Um... Number 89, please. Temptation.

471
00:45:35,436 --> 00:45:36,971
当然。
Of course.

472
00:45:37,004 --> 00:45:38,839
你的名字,请。哈里斯。
-Your name, please. -Harris.

473
00:45:38,872 --> 00:45:40,874
Ada哈里斯太太。
Mrs. Ada Harris.

474
00:45:44,311 --> 00:45:45,879
我的道歉,夫人。
My apologies, madame.

475
00:45:45,913 --> 00:45:47,881
-Excusez-moi。-哦,是的。
-Excusez-moi. -Oh, yeah.

476
00:45:56,591 --> 00:45:59,793
——啊。-哦。哈哈。
-Ah. -Oh. Ta-da.

477
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:07,835
哈里斯夫人，我很遗憾……《诱惑》有个难题。
Madame Harris, I regret... Well, there is a difficulty with Temptation.

478
00:46:07,868 --> 00:46:09,870
看来是阿瓦隆夫人要求的。
It seems Madame Avallon demands it.

479
00:46:09,903 --> 00:46:12,172
那是怎么做到的呢?你只有一条裙子?
How's that work, then? You only got the one dress?

480
00:46:12,206 --> 00:46:14,875
对不起。夫人坚持独享。
I'm sorry. Madame insists on exclusivity.

481
00:46:14,908 --> 00:46:17,978
阿瓦隆夫人是我们最忠实的客户之一。
Madame Avallon is one of our most devoted clients.

482
00:46:18,012 --> 00:46:20,247
她的丈夫被称为“垃圾之王”。
And her husband is known as "The King of Rubbish."

483
00:46:20,281 --> 00:46:25,019
但如果你不买任何东西就离开了，我们会很遗憾的。
But we would be so sorry if you were to leave Maison Dior without a purchase.

484
00:46:25,052 --> 00:46:27,154
你还在卡片上写了73号。
And you also wrote number 73 on your card.

485
00:46:27,187 --> 00:46:28,289
-哦。金星。
-Oh. -Vénus.

486
00:46:28,322 --> 00:46:30,958
是啊，我从没想过有比这更美的东西。
Yeah, I never thought nothing could be more beautiful.

487
00:46:30,991 --> 00:46:32,527
直到我看到《诱惑》。
Not till I saw Temptation.

488
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,428
不错的选择，夫人。
An excellent choice, madame.

489
00:46:34,461 --> 00:46:36,297
是的。多少钱?
Yeah. How much is it?

490
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:39,601
Vénus是60万法郎。
Vénus is 600,000 francs.

491
00:46:39,634 --> 00:46:42,036
430磅。
430 pounds.

492
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:45,272
包起来。我还要赶飞机。
Wrap it up. I got a plane to catch.

493
00:46:45,306 --> 00:46:47,041
我已经晚了一天了。
I'm a day late as it is.

494
00:46:47,074 --> 00:46:48,909
哦，这件礼服不能给你。
Oh, you cannot have this gown.

495
00:46:48,942 --> 00:46:51,546
别告诉我有人想要独家的。
Oh, don't tell me someone wants that exclusive and all.

496
00:46:51,579 --> 00:46:55,983
哈里斯夫人，每件衣服都是为客户量身定做的。
Mais Madame Harris, every dress is made and fitted individually for the client.

497
00:46:56,016 --> 00:46:58,352
是的，这是高级时装。
Yes, this is haute couture.

498
00:46:58,385 --> 00:47:04,325
当然，我们会完全按照你看到的复制Vénus，但问题是……给我做一个?
We will, of course, reproduce Vénus exactly as you saw it, but the thing is... Make me one?

499
00:47:04,358 --> 00:47:05,560
那要花多长时间?
How long's that gonna take?

500
00:47:05,593 --> 00:47:07,194
嗯，至少两周。
Well, at least two weeks.

501
00:47:07,227 --> 00:47:09,129
哦。至少。
Ooh. At least.

502
00:47:09,163 --> 00:47:11,031
有几个配件是必要的。
Several fittings are necessary.

503
00:47:11,065 --> 00:47:12,600
什么，离开我的族人两周吗?
What, leave my people for a fortnight?

504
00:47:12,634 --> 00:47:14,935
他们会找别人，然后我就流落街头了。
They'd find someone else, and then I'd be out on the streets.

505
00:47:14,968 --> 00:47:16,437
欢迎，欢迎，去机场。
Vite, vite, to the airport, then.

506
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:18,939
如果你误了航班，我不会原谅自己的。
I would not forgive myself if you missed your flight.

507
00:47:18,972 --> 00:47:21,108
什么，没有我的裙子吗?-Excusez-moi。
-What, without my dress? -Excusez-moi.

508
00:47:22,677 --> 00:47:25,045
也许你可以给朋友打个电话?
Perhaps there is a friend you can call?

509
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:27,582
可以帮你打扫卫生的人。
Someone who can assist you with your cleaning.

510
00:47:27,615 --> 00:47:30,518
小维在那儿，但我已经试过她的耐心了。
Well, uh, there's Vi, but I've tried her patience enough as it is.

511
00:47:30,552 --> 00:47:31,985
总之，她不在电话上。
Anyway, she's not on the phone.

512
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:33,887
我们可以给她发个电报。
Uh, we might send her a telegram.

513
00:47:37,257 --> 00:47:43,197
哈里斯太太，也许你可以鼓励裁剪工和裁缝工作得快一点。
Uh, Mrs. Harris, uh, it might be possible to encourage the cutter and seamstress to work a little faster.

514
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:46,400
六世夫人也许可以给你一个星期的时间?
And Madame Vi could fill you in for one week, perhaps?

515
00:47:47,535 --> 00:47:51,506
嗯…你真好，但是我不能。
Well... you're kind, but I can't.

516
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:54,108
总之，我没地方住。
Anyway, I got nowhere to stay.

517
00:47:54,942 --> 00:47:56,877
我只好不去了。
I'll have to give it a miss.

518
00:47:59,279 --> 00:48:01,115
我姐姐不在。
My sister is away.

519
00:48:01,148 --> 00:48:07,888
如果你……可以接受，你可以住在我那，我姐姐的房间。
If you... would accept, um, you could stay at my place, uh, in my sister's room.

520
00:48:09,022 --> 00:48:12,059
你真是个天使，不是吗?
You're a proper angel, aren't you?

521
00:48:12,727 --> 00:48:14,294
这是我的荣幸。
It'll be my pleasure.

522
00:48:14,328 --> 00:48:15,630
我们可以马上给你量尺寸。
Um, we can have your measurements taken at once.

523
00:48:15,663 --> 00:48:17,164
好吗，科尔伯特夫人?
N'est-ce pas, Madame Colbert?

524
00:48:26,073 --> 00:48:27,441
哈里斯夫人。来了。
Come, Madame Harris. Come.

525
00:48:27,474 --> 00:48:28,942
-哦。-我们必须快点。
-Oh. -We must be quick.

526
00:48:28,976 --> 00:48:30,244
如果你们褶。
S'il vous plaît.

527
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:37,951
哦。
Oh.

528
00:48:37,985 --> 00:48:39,554
布拉沃,夫人。布拉沃。
-Bravo, madame. -Bravo.

529
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:48,429
-请,夫人。-哦。
-Please, madame. -Oh.

530
00:48:48,462 --> 00:48:51,965
当你在伍尔沃斯买一件连衣裙时，你不会听到这样的欢呼。
You don't get all this hoo-ha when you buy a frock down Woolworths.

531
00:48:51,999 --> 00:48:55,603
我可以告诉你，这种事在这里也不是每天都发生的。
Well, I can tell you such things do not happen every day here, either.

532
00:48:55,637 --> 00:48:57,938
啊，那位必须穿裙子的女士……
Ah, the lady who must have her dress...

533
00:49:00,642 --> 00:49:02,276
你的外套,请。
Your coat, please.

534
00:49:02,309 --> 00:49:04,011
哦。
Oh.

535
00:49:05,647 --> 00:49:08,949
等开襟羊毛衫。-是的,我。。
-Et le cardigan. -Yeah, me cardy.

536
00:49:10,618 --> 00:49:12,486
非常感谢。
Thank you very much.

537
00:49:14,556 --> 00:49:16,089
哦。
Oh.

538
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:32,473
夫人有模特的身材。
Madame has the proportions of a model.

539
00:49:33,741 --> 00:49:35,543
更像是铁路模型。

540
00:49:37,044 --> 00:49:38,680
其中一个曲线部分。

00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:53,628
哦。
Oh.

545

我可以载你一程吗?

好吧，如果不麻烦的话。

他是你的朋友吗，福维尔先生?
Is he a friend of yours, Mr. Fauvel?

552
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:15,382
没有。不，我只知道福维尔先生是签支票的人。
No. No, I-I know Mr. Fauvel only as the hand that signs my check.

553
00:50:15,415 --> 00:50:17,017
哦。
Oh.

554
00:50:17,652 --> 00:50:19,219
哦。
Oh.

555
00:50:19,253 --> 00:50:22,155
être和néant。
L'être et le néant.

556
00:50:22,189 --> 00:50:24,424
是"存在与不存在"
It's, uh, "Being and Not Being."

557
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:28,530
我自己也喜欢沉浸在有趣的神秘故事中。
I like to curl up with a juicy mystery meself.

00:51:03,598 --> 00:51:05,499
这是歌剧。
That's the opera.

562
00:51:18,913 --> 00:51:20,582
我帮您拿行李好吗?
May I help you with your luggage?

563
00:51:20,615 --> 00:51:23,283
里面什么都没有。
Nothing in it yet.

564
00:51:23,317 --> 00:51:26,186
哦。这是,不是吗?
Oh. That's something, innit?

565
00:51:36,631 --> 00:51:38,231
哦。
Ooh.

566
00:51:42,336 --> 00:51:45,172
我觉得他姐姐不知道拖把在哪。
I don't think his sister knows where the mop is.

567
00:51:46,641 --> 00:51:49,343
一定有簸箕和刷子。
There must be a dustpan and brush somewhere.

568
00:51:54,281 --> 00:51:57,685
嗯…哦。
Uh... Oh.

569
00:52:01,789 --> 00:52:03,791
你不用这么做的，亲爱的。
Oh, you don't have to do that, love.

570
00:52:03,825 --> 00:52:06,226
你一定有更重要的事要做。
You must have better things to do.

571
00:52:06,259 --> 00:52:08,195
不,不是真的。
No, not really.

572
00:52:08,228 --> 00:52:12,700
在défilé之后，总有一种空虚的感觉。
After the défilé, there's always a certain feeling of emptiness.

573
00:52:12,734 --> 00:52:13,901
哦。
Oh.

574
00:52:13,935 --> 00:52:15,670
好吧,鸭子。
All right, ducks.

575
00:52:16,671 --> 00:52:19,439
哦。啊哈。
Oh. Aha.

576
00:52:19,473 --> 00:52:22,275
现在我们开始工作了。
Now we're in business.

577
00:52:28,549 --> 00:52:30,317
哦。
Oh.

578
00:52:32,352 --> 00:52:34,589
-哈里斯太太?——你好,爱。
- Mrs. Harris? - Hello, love.

579
00:52:36,289 --> 00:52:37,759
小姐。
Mademoiselle.

580
00:52:37,792 --> 00:52:39,259
她是个好工人。
She's a good worker.

581
00:52:39,292 --> 00:52:41,963
我总能给你找份工作，我的姑娘，如果你当不成模特的话。
I can always find you a job, my girl, if the modeling don't work out.

582
00:52:46,233 --> 00:52:48,301
不,不。
No, no.

583
00:52:52,907 --> 00:52:55,342
噢!噢!
Oh! Oh!

584
00:53:02,449 --> 00:53:03,818
M-Mrs。哈里斯做了晚饭。
M-Mrs. Harris has cooked the dinner.

585
00:53:03,851 --> 00:53:08,388
你看起来需要一顿丰盛的大餐，你们俩。
You look like you could do with a good square meal, the pair of you.

586
00:53:08,422 --> 00:53:10,424
娜塔莎小姐还有别的事要做。
Well, Mademoiselle Natasha has other engagements.

587
00:53:10,457 --> 00:53:13,293
我相信迪奥的形象总是出现在派对或首映式上。
I'm sure the face of Dior is always at a party or premiere.

588
00:53:13,326 --> 00:53:15,663
稍后会有一个soirée。
There's a soirée later.

589
00:53:16,731 --> 00:53:19,199
来吧。Grub。
Come on. Grub's up.

590
00:53:24,005 --> 00:53:26,339
我们到了。
Here we are.

591
00:53:26,373 --> 00:53:28,341
别让它凉了。
Don't let it get cold.

592
00:53:32,847 --> 00:53:35,248
好胃口。好胃口。
-Bon appétit. -Bon appétit.

593
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:38,452
埃迪最喜欢的。
My Eddie's favorite.

594
00:53:38,485 --> 00:53:40,822
要是再来点肉汁就更好了。
Be even better if we had a bit of gravy.

595
00:53:41,789 --> 00:53:43,591
嗯，这道菜叫什么名字?
Um, and what's the dish named?

596
00:53:43,624 --> 00:53:46,359
面拖烤肉。
Toad-in-the-hole.

597
00:53:51,398 --> 00:53:54,736
多好的书啊，福维尔先生。
What a lot of books, Mr. Fauvel.

598
00:53:54,769 --> 00:53:56,336
哦。
Oh.

599
00:53:56,369 --> 00:53:58,740
娜塔莎有个谋杀悬疑案。
Natasha's got a corker, a murder-mystery.

600
00:53:58,773 --> 00:54:00,273
鸭子,你不?
Don't you, ducks?

601
00:54:03,878 --> 00:54:04,846
我们应该说英语。
We should speak English.

602
00:54:04,879 --> 00:54:05,880
哦,是的。当然。
Oh, yeah. Of course.

603
00:54:05,913 --> 00:54:11,552
我很想知道娜塔莎小姐在读一本书法国哲学家让-保罗·萨特写的。-哦。
Um, I-I'm interested to learn that Mademoiselle Natasha is reading a book -by the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. -Oh.

604
00:54:11,586 --> 00:54:13,788
作者要求我们考虑服务员的情况。
The author asks us to consider the case of the waiter.

605
00:54:13,821 --> 00:54:17,658
服务员就是服务员，还是只是服务员的一种表达?
Is the waiter the waiter, or is it just an expression of what the waiter is?

606
00:54:17,692 --> 00:54:21,763
同样的，我是会计吗，还是你的外在印象?
Um, similarly, am I the accountant, or is that an outward impression?

607
00:54:21,796 --> 00:54:29,737
娜塔莎小姐是最美丽，最精致神圣的巴黎模特，还是…还是说表象背后另有其人?
Um, is Mademoiselle Natasha only the most beautiful, the most exquisitely divine Parisian model, or... Or is there another person behind the facade?

608
00:54:30,671 --> 00:54:31,739
是的。
Yes.

609
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:37,879
哈里斯太太是清洁工吗，还是她的存在更有意义?
Is Mrs. Harris the cleaner, or is there more to define her existence?

610
00:54:37,912 --> 00:54:39,412
完全一样。
Exactement.

611
00:54:39,446 --> 00:54:41,916
我是巴特西的清洁工。没有秘密。
I'm a cleaner from Battersea. No mystery there.

612
00:54:41,949 --> 00:54:45,385
不，你是一个梦想着世界上最漂亮礼服的清洁工。
Uh, no, you're a cleaner who dreams of the most beautiful gown in the world.

613
00:54:45,418 --> 00:54:47,454
哦,梦,是吗?
Oh, dreams, eh?

614
00:54:48,623 --> 00:54:52,794
天知道维收到那封电报会说什么。
God knows what Vi is gonna say when she gets that blooming telegram.

615
00:55:04,806 --> 00:55:06,607
哈里斯太太吗?
Mrs. Harris?

616
00:55:06,641 --> 00:55:09,577
请随便穿我妹妹的衣服。
Uh, please help yourself to my sister's clothes.

哦,谢谢你,爱。嗯，我还好。
Oh, thanks, love. Um, I'm all right.

618
00:55:14,381 --> 00:55:16,316
呃，她会坚持的。
Uh, she would insist.

619
00:55:17,852 --> 00:55:19,120
晚安
Good night.

620
00:55:19,153 --> 00:55:20,721
晚上,爱。
Night, love.

621
00:55:20,755 --> 00:55:22,590
甜蜜的梦想。
Sweet dreams.

622
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,175
噢!
Ooh!

623
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:16,376
站直,夫人。
Stand straight, madame.

624
00:56:17,578 --> 00:56:20,982
——哦!——不,但是……保持不动。你为什么要搬家?
- Oh! - Non, mais... Keep still. Why do you move?

625
00:56:21,015 --> 00:56:22,583
对不起。对不起。
Sorry. Sorry.

626
00:56:26,654 --> 00:56:27,955
玛格丽特公主吗?
Princess Margaret?

627
00:56:27,989 --> 00:56:29,489
哦，我喜欢她。
Oh, I like her.

628
00:56:29,523 --> 00:56:30,925
你可以从她的眼睛里看到一丝调皮。
You can see a little bit of mischief in her eye.

629
00:56:30,958 --> 00:56:34,795
我们尊贵的客户要求我们谨慎行事。
Our distinguished clients demand our utmost discretion.

630
00:56:38,065 --> 00:56:39,867
今天就到这里。
That's all for today.

631
00:56:41,535 --> 00:56:43,871
只要一点点，就能帮上大忙，不是吗?
Little bit of that one goes a long way, don't it?

632
00:56:43,905 --> 00:56:45,506
她吃什么?
What's eating her?

633
00:56:45,539 --> 00:56:47,909
客户越重要，就越困难。
Well, the more grand the client, the more difficult.

634
00:56:47,942 --> 00:56:53,514
必须始终满足他们的愿望，即使这意味着重新开始。
Their wishes must be accommodated always, even if it means starting afresh.

635
00:56:53,547 --> 00:56:55,616
-他们在交货前不付款。-哦!
-And they do not pay until delivery. -Oh!

636
00:56:55,650 --> 00:56:56,684
如果。
If then.

637
00:56:56,717 --> 00:56:59,186
有那么多薪水要找。
There are so many salaries to find.

638
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:04,558
布料、辫子、刺绣、纽扣都必须是最好的。
The fabric, braid, embroidery, buttons all must be the very best.

639
00:57:04,592 --> 00:57:06,193
每个人都有压力:
The pressure is on everyone:

640
00:57:06,227 --> 00:57:15,670
对福维尔先生和帐目，对科尔伯特夫人和女裁缝，甚至对迪奥先生本人，总是有这样的压力。
on Mr. Fauvel and the accounts, on Madame Colbert and the seamstresses, even on Monsieur Dior himself, always such pressure.

641
00:57:15,703 --> 00:57:19,674
难怪福维尔先生看到我的小手提包这么高兴。
Well, no wonder Mr. Fauvel was so pleased to see my little handbag.

642
00:57:19,707 --> 00:57:25,813
事实上，哈里斯夫人，我们都担心迪奥品牌不能一直这样下去。
Well, in truth, Madame Harris, all of us fear the House of Dior cannot keep going this way.

643
00:57:42,129 --> 00:57:43,597
是的,先生。
Oui, monsieur.

644
00:57:54,942 --> 00:57:56,610
你没事吧，亲爱的?
You all right, love?

645
00:57:58,245 --> 00:58:00,214
醒来吧,醒来吧。
Wakey, wakey.

646
00:58:00,247 --> 00:58:02,183
他们在找你。
They're calling for you.

647
00:58:02,216 --> 00:58:03,884
哦。
Oh.

648
00:58:03,918 --> 00:58:05,987
嗯,我很抱歉。
Um, I'm sorry.

649
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:07,588
-我只是太累了。-嗯。
-I'm just tired. -Mm-hmm.

650
00:58:07,621 --> 00:58:09,657
你可以休个假。
You could do with a little holiday.

651
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:11,625
它已经给我带来了好处。
It's doing me the power of good already.

652
00:58:11,659 --> 00:58:14,028
是的，那太好了。
Yes, that would be nice.

653
00:58:15,129 --> 00:58:19,734
独自一人在海边，没有人……对不起。
By myself at the seaside, where nobody... I'm sorry.

654
00:58:19,767 --> 00:58:21,769
我必须走了。谢谢你！-哦。
-I must go. Thank you. -Oh.

655
00:58:39,153 --> 00:58:40,921
谢谢你！
Thank you.

656
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:44,959
夫人，您试穿得怎么样?
How was your fitting, madame?

657
00:58:44,992 --> 00:58:46,193
哦。
Oh.

658
00:58:46,227 --> 00:58:48,629
这不是我的老朋友罗斯巴德先生吗。
Well, if it isn't my old pal, Mr. Rosebud.

659
00:58:48,662 --> 00:58:51,665
很遗憾我们没有好好介绍一下。

00:58:55,202 --> 00:58:57,538
艾达·哈里斯，巴特西的寡妇。
Ada Harris, widow of Battersea.

663
00:58:58,172 --> 00:58:59,673
这个好人是谁?
Who's this fine fella?

664
00:58:59,707 --> 00:59:01,242
这是雀巢巧伴伴。-哦。
-This is Nesquik. -Oh.

665
00:59:01,275 --> 00:59:04,645
那么，我相信迪奥先生满足了你的愿望?
So, I trust Monsieur Dior fulfills your heart's desire?

666
00:59:04,678 --> 00:59:06,747
哦，他们真是太好了。

667
00:59:07,681 --> 00:59:10,584
路易丝调研。我忘了名字。

668
00:59:10,618 --> 00:59:13,554
哦，我得给你看样东西。
Oh, I must show you something.

669
00:59:14,321 --> 00:59:16,724
拜托，我不会耽误你太久的。

671
00:59:31,739 --> 00:59:33,941
我妻子很喜欢Marché aux Fleurs。
My wife adored the Marché aux Fleurs.

672
00:59:35,242 --> 00:59:38,079
我们几乎到最后才回来。
We came here almost until the end.

673
00:59:38,112 --> 00:59:40,247
到现在已经七年了。
It's been seven years now.

674
00:59:40,281 --> 00:59:42,750
我们在修补，但我们不会忘记。
We mend, but we don't forget.

675
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:51,859
当你向全世界展示你的迪奥连衣裙时，它将是完美的。——哦。
When you display your Dior dress to the world, - it will be perfection. - Oh.

676
00:59:54,228 --> 00:59:56,163
我朋友维觉得我疯了。
My pal Vi thinks I'm barmy.

677
00:59:58,265 --> 01:00:00,034
“你要那件衣服干什么?”
"What do you want that dress for?

678
01:00:00,067 --> 01:00:02,236
你打算什么时候穿?”
When are you gonna wear it?"

679
01:00:02,269 --> 01:00:07,675
我不怀疑你想要这么好的礼服，即使只是为了你的眼睛。
Oh, I do not question your desire for a gown of such quality, even if it is for your eyes alone.

680
01:00:07,708 --> 01:00:10,111
不，不，恰恰相反，我明白。
No, no, on the contrary, I understand.

681
01:00:10,144 --> 01:00:18,886
你看，像这样的一朵玫瑰或像你这样漂亮的一件礼服，它们……它们使我们回忆起青春如花的日子。
You see, a rose like this one or a beautiful gown such as yours, they... they recall the days when we were in the full flower of our youth.

682
01:00:19,753 --> 01:00:22,189
喂，先别把我一笔勾销。
Oi, don't write me off just yet.

683
01:00:24,058 --> 01:00:27,261
-哦，万分抱歉。-哦,不。
- Oh, a thousand apologies. - Oh, no.

684
01:00:27,294 --> 01:00:29,630
请允许我赔罪。
Please, allow me to make amends.

685
01:00:30,431 --> 01:00:34,101
你今晚有安排吗?
Have you any arrangements for tonight?

686
01:00:43,244 --> 01:00:44,378
瞧。
Voilà.

687
01:00:44,411 --> 01:00:46,013
噢,谢谢你。
Oh, thank you.

688
01:00:58,159 --> 01:00:59,293
来点香槟?
Some champagne?

689
01:00:59,326 --> 01:01:00,427
哦，好的，请。
Uh, oh, yes, please.

690
01:01:00,461 --> 01:01:01,962
就一滴
Just a drop.

691
01:01:03,097 --> 01:01:04,331
谢谢你！
Thank you.

692
01:01:04,365 --> 01:01:06,233
现在，你一定要尝尝鱼子酱。
Now, you-you must try the caviar.

693
01:01:06,267 --> 01:01:07,768
哦。好吧
Oh. Right.

694
01:01:07,801 --> 01:01:09,904
干杯。干杯。
-Cheers. -Cheers.

695
01:01:15,409 --> 01:01:17,178
-不错吧?-嗯。
-Nice, huh? -Mm.

696
01:01:17,211 --> 01:01:18,479
哦,哦,你好!
Uh, oh, hello!

697
01:01:20,347 --> 01:01:23,317
我觉得你这身打扮骗不了任何人。你呢?
I don't think that getup's gonna fool anyone. Do you?

698
01:01:30,224 --> 01:01:31,959
可爱的女孩。
Lovely girls.

699
01:01:31,992 --> 01:01:33,494
嗯。很快，你就会看到多么可爱。
Hmm. Soon, you'll see how lovely.

700
01:01:40,502 --> 01:01:43,237
噢!哦。稳定。
Ooh! Oh. Steady on.

701
01:01:50,844 --> 01:01:52,813
天啊，她们是靠自己赚钱的。
Blimey, they earn their keep, them girls.

702
01:01:52,846 --> 01:01:57,218
至少我打扫的时候，不用笑着脱衣服了。
Well, least when I'm cleaning, I don't have to smile and strip as well.

703
01:02:00,387 --> 01:02:02,089
晚安,哈里斯太太。
Bonsoir, Mrs. Harris.

704
01:02:02,122 --> 01:02:03,490
娜塔莎。你好,爱。
Natasha. Hello, love.

705
01:02:03,525 --> 01:02:04,959
你好。
Hello.

706
01:02:04,992 --> 01:02:06,894
晚上好,小姐。
Bonsoir, mademoiselle.

707
01:02:06,927 --> 01:02:08,829
你愿意和我们一起去吗?-嗯,是的,请。
-Would you like to join us? -Uh, yes, please.

708
01:02:08,862 --> 01:02:10,231
那你和谁一起来的?
Who are you here with, then?

709
01:02:10,264 --> 01:02:11,966
投资者。
Investors.

710
01:02:11,999 --> 01:02:13,968
我逃离了，但只是片刻。
I escape but only for a moment.

711
01:02:14,001 --> 01:02:17,171
他们不会让你整天整夜都在做。
They don't half keep you at it, all day and all night as well.

712
01:02:17,204 --> 01:02:19,974
对于Maison Dior来说，这是我的义务。
For Maison Dior, this is my obligation.

713
01:02:20,007 --> 01:02:22,376
好吧，迪奥不仅仅是长袍。
Ah, well, Dior is not just about gowns.

714
01:02:22,409 --> 01:02:34,054
它还讲述了巴黎的优雅、颓废和精明，还有……而你，娜塔莎小姐，你是这顶迪奥王冠上的明珠。
It's also about elegance and decadence and the savoir-vivre of Paris, and... and you, Mademoiselle Natasha, you are the jewel of this Dior crown.

715
01:02:34,088 --> 01:02:36,457
嗯，我更喜欢待在家里看书。
Well, I would prefer to be at home with a book.

716
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:38,125
你这么说真有趣。
It's funny you should say that.

717
01:02:38,158 --> 01:02:40,261
我把福维尔先生留在家里看书了。
I've left Mr. Fauvel at home reading a book.

718
01:02:40,294 --> 01:02:45,266
它被称为…“好管闲事”?就像这样。
It was called... "Nosy"? Something like that.

719
01:02:45,299 --> 01:02:47,935
恶心?不知道。
-La nausée? -Don't know.

720
01:02:48,969 --> 01:02:53,907
与萨特和知识分子的世界相比，他为什么容忍时装店呢?
Why does he tolerate the fashion house compared to his world of Sartre and the intellect?

721
01:02:54,576 --> 01:02:57,011
我想他有他的理由。
Well, I-I think he has his reasons.

722
01:03:04,885 --> 01:03:06,220
你喜欢这个节目吗?
Do you enjoy the show?

723
01:03:06,253 --> 01:03:11,892
是的,一个…最后那个，她…她和我蒂尔达阿姨长得一模一样。
Yeah, the one... the one at the end, she... she's a dead ringer for my Aunt Tilda.

724
01:03:11,925 --> 01:03:13,460
从后面。
From behind.

725
01:03:16,463 --> 01:03:19,033
这很好，但我该走了。
Well, this was lovely, but I should go.

726
01:03:19,066 --> 01:03:20,434
谢谢你！
Thank you.

727
01:03:20,467 --> 01:03:22,269
哦，等一下，亲爱的。
Oh, just-just a minute, love.

728
01:03:22,303 --> 01:03:23,571
你的刘海
Your fringe.

729
01:03:23,605 --> 01:03:25,372
有一点差距。
There's a little gap.

730
01:03:25,406 --> 01:03:27,174
就是这样。
That's it.

731
01:03:28,008 --> 01:03:29,544
你取得了胜利。
You have made a conquest.

732
01:03:29,577 --> 01:03:31,312
哦，去你的。
Oh, get away with you.

733
01:03:31,345 --> 01:03:34,448
你敢追逐自己的梦想，哈里斯太太。
You dare to follow your dreams, Mrs. Harris.

734
01:03:34,481 --> 01:03:36,216
布拉沃。-哦。
-Bravo. -Oh.

735
01:03:37,451 --> 01:03:38,952
再见,爱。
Bye, love.

736
01:03:38,986 --> 01:03:41,556
晚上好。晚安,娜塔莎。
-Bonsoir. -Bonsoir, Natasha.

737
01:03:44,626 --> 01:03:46,594
有的是更多的香槟吗?-哦，就一小滴。
-Some more champagne? -Oh, just a drop.

738
01:03:46,628 --> 01:03:49,430
我九点半要去试衣。
I've got me fitting at 9:30.

739
01:04:58,232 --> 01:04:59,667
哦,上帝!
Oh, God!

740
01:05:01,603 --> 01:05:04,071
哦,戈登•班尼特!
Oh, Gordon Bennett!

741
01:05:05,239 --> 01:05:06,306
哦,哦!
Oh, oh!

742
01:05:07,241 --> 01:05:08,308
噢!噢!
Oh! Oh!

743
01:05:10,444 --> 01:05:12,146
小心!
Careful!

744
01:05:14,114 --> 01:05:16,450
哦,哦,哦!
Oh, oh, oh!

745
01:05:17,217 --> 01:05:18,285
噢!
Oh!

746
01:05:32,099 --> 01:05:33,467
我真不敢相信。
I can't believe this.

747
01:05:40,708 --> 01:05:42,342
对不起!
Sorry!

748
01:05:45,045 --> 01:05:48,248
对不起。对不起。
Sorry. Sorry.

749
01:05:49,082 --> 01:05:51,586
我很抱歉。-不,不,不。
-I'm so sorry. -No, no, no.

750
01:05:51,619 --> 01:05:53,420
这是不可能的，完全不可能。
This is not possible, not at all.

751
01:05:53,454 --> 01:05:58,258
不不不，求你了，我…我从不迟到。我…R-Really,我不是。我从不迟到。对不起。
No, no, no, please, I-I'm... I'm never late. I... R-Really, I'm not. I'm never late. Sorry.

752
01:05:58,292 --> 01:06:00,595
你要求我们"请，请，请"
You demand of us, "Vite, vite, vite,"

753
01:06:00,628 --> 01:06:02,597
但你一点也不尊重。
but you have no respect.

754
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:05,466
不，这是不可能的。
No, this cannot be done.

755
01:06:05,499 --> 01:06:07,434
不客气。
Not at all.

756
01:06:07,468 --> 01:06:09,336
现在我离开了。
Now I depart.

757
01:06:09,369 --> 01:06:11,205
这是完成了。
This is finished.

758
01:06:11,238 --> 01:06:13,474

760
01:06:15,042 --> 01:06:17,377
Carré先生拒绝继续。
Monsieur Carré refuses to proceed.

761
01:06:17,411 --> 01:06:19,079
我该怎么办?
What can I do?

762
01:06:19,112 --> 01:06:23,217
没有。不，当然，我…不,我理解。
No. No, of course, I... No, I understand.

763
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:25,352
是的，我当然喜欢。我做的事。
Yeah, of course I do. I do.

764
01:06:27,154 --> 01:06:29,289
迪奥，这不仅仅是一件礼服。
Dior, it's-it's not just a gown.

765
01:06:29,323 --> 01:06:34,729
这是,嗯……都是优雅和精明之类的。
It's, um... It's all the elegance and-and the savvy and all that.

我看看能不能退还您的押金。
I will see what can be done to return your deposit.

768
01:06:39,601 --> 01:06:42,369
不,我不…

769
01:06:47,407 --> 01:06:53,548
我…我不希望…我不要押金。
I-I... I don't want... I don't want me deposit.

770
01:06:56,283 --> 01:06:58,418
香槟查理，对吧?
Right Champagne Charlie, aren't I?

771
01:06:58,452 --> 01:07:01,154
我活该，过着奢侈的生活。

我很尊重你们，尊重你们所有人。

你好,夫人。-你好。

786
01:09:17,692 --> 01:09:19,560
这不是缝纫。

01:09:20,427 --> 01:09:21,929
它在制造月光

788
01:09:23,831 --> 01:09:25,733
我上天堂了吗?
Have I gone to heaven?

01:10:40,041 --> 01:10:46,446
从le maître推出他的第一个系列开始，十年来我日日夜夜都站在迪奥先生的肩膀旁。
I have stood at Monsieur Dior's shoulder day and night for ten years, since le maître unveiled his first collection.

但还有你，哈里斯太太。

哦。干杯。

你为什么到这儿来，哈里斯太太?

At the Vienna Opera Ball or Queen Charlotte's?

Will you wear it to polish floors, or will you keep it shut in your little wardrobe?

807
01:11:59,821 --> 01:12:03,591
迪奥连衣裙的设计是为了让人惊讶和愉悦。
A Dior dress is designed to astonish and delight.

808
01:12:03,624 --> 01:12:05,793
你打算怎么做，哈里斯太太?
How will you do that, Mrs. Harris?

809
01:12:05,827 --> 01:12:11,464
你……请原谅我这么说，但你是无名小卒，隐形人。
You... Forgive me for saying this, but you are nobody, invisible.

810
01:12:11,498 --> 01:12:14,602
你要如何赋予这条裙子应有的生命?
How will you give this dress the life it deserves?

811
01:12:16,871 --> 01:12:18,773
这是我的梦想。
It's my dream.

812
01:12:19,807 --> 01:12:21,909
我的钱和别人的一样好。
And my money's as good as anybody else's.

813
01:12:21,943 --> 01:12:23,811
当然可以。嗯。
Bien sûr. Hmm.

814
01:12:23,845 --> 01:12:27,447
你可以买到你的梦想，但你会用它来做什么呢?
You may buy your dream, but what will you do with it?

815
01:12:29,482 --> 01:12:31,786
是的,可以。
Oui, entrez.

816
01:12:32,687 --> 01:12:36,023
哈里斯太太，这是给你的。
Mrs. Harris, these are for you.

817
01:12:36,057 --> 01:12:37,424
哦。
Ooh.

818
01:12:37,457 --> 01:12:39,727
来自侯爵先生。
From Monsieur le Marquis.

819
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,762
哦。
Oh.

820
01:12:41,796 --> 01:12:44,599
他希望你明天来喝茶。
He wishes that you visit for tea tomorrow.

821
01:12:44,632 --> 01:12:46,466
查萨尼侯爵?
Le Marquis de Chassagne?

822
01:12:46,499 --> 01:12:48,970
但是…他收到没有。
But... he receives nobody.

823
01:12:49,937 --> 01:12:52,372
但我是个无名小卒，不是吗?
But I am nobody, aren't I?

824
01:13:00,982 --> 01:13:04,652
我从没想过像迪奥这样的地方会有问题。
I never thought a place like Dior would have problems.

825
01:13:05,519 --> 01:13:09,891
我看到那件衣服，就想起了梦想和童话。
I saw that dress, and I thought of dreams and fairy tales.

826
01:13:09,924 --> 01:13:12,760
是的，我们就像一个童话故事。
Yes, we are like a fairy tale.

827
01:13:12,793 --> 01:13:15,563
可爱但不真实。
Lovely but not real.

828
01:13:15,596 --> 01:13:17,565
今天有这个位置吗?
Is there a place for that today?

829
01:13:17,598 --> 01:13:19,767
哦，我们需要梦想。
Oh, we need our dreams.

830
01:13:20,568 --> 01:13:22,536
现在更是如此。
Now more than ever.

831
01:13:31,545 --> 01:13:33,948
如果你能拥有这个，为什么还需要迪奥?
If you can have this, why do you need Dior?

832
01:13:33,981 --> 01:13:37,618
高级时装对我们和我们的客户来说是一种虚荣。
Haute couture is a vanity for us and our clients.

833
01:13:37,652 --> 01:13:41,188
事实上，我不认为迪奥品牌能存活下来。
In truth, I don't think the House of Dior can survive.

834
01:13:41,222 --> 01:13:43,591
不，亲爱的，那太悲剧了。
No, love, that would be a tragedy.

835
01:13:43,624 --> 01:13:45,593
你不能让这种事发生。
You can't allow that to happen.

836
01:13:45,626 --> 01:13:50,598
好吧，我有个主意，但这需要一种新的思维方式。
Well, I have an idea, but it requires a new way of thinking.

837
01:13:50,631 --> 01:13:52,199
什么?霸道靴挡道了?
What? Bossy Boots in the way?

838
01:13:52,233 --> 01:13:55,503
科尔伯特夫人，她守卫着神庙。
Madame Colbert, she guards the temple.

839
01:13:55,536 --> 01:13:57,939
她让一个清洁女工买了一件迪奥礼服。
She let a cleaning lady buy a Dior gown.

840
01:13:57,972 --> 01:13:59,073
有钱能使鬼推磨
Money talks.

841
01:13:59,106 --> 01:14:02,843
是的，你知道上面写了什么，所以你得做点什么。
Yes, and you know what it says, so you have to do something about it.

842
01:14:02,877 --> 01:14:05,680
我知道你可以。你真聪明。
I know you can. You're ever so clever.

843
01:14:06,614 --> 01:14:08,149
你是唯一相信的人。
You're the only one who believes.

844
01:14:12,987 --> 01:14:16,090
这是怎么回事?
What's going on here?

845
01:14:16,123 --> 01:14:17,959
看起来像首映。
It looks like a premiere.

846
01:14:17,992 --> 01:14:19,093
噢!
Ooh!

847
01:14:19,126 --> 01:14:21,862
哦,令人兴奋。
Oh, exciting.

848
01:14:22,863 --> 01:14:24,966
哦，那是吉恩·法布尔，电影明星。
Oh, that's Jean Fabre, the movie star.

849
01:14:28,269 --> 01:14:30,204
难道他不知道吗?
Mm, and don't he know it?

850
01:14:40,948 --> 01:14:43,751
哦,这是娜塔莎!噢!
Oh, it's Natasha! Oh!

851
01:14:50,658 --> 01:14:53,027
娜塔莎!奥奥!-你在干什么?不,不。
-Natasha! Ooh-ooh! -What are you doing? No, no.

852
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:55,262
-娜塔莎!——没有。
- Natasha! - No.

853
01:14:55,296 --> 01:14:57,098
你好。
Hello.

854
01:14:57,131 --> 01:14:58,265
晚上好，哈里斯太太。
Good evening, Mrs. Harris.

855
01:14:58,299 --> 01:14:59,967
你看起来可爱。
You look lovely.

856
01:15:00,001 --> 01:15:01,736
谢谢你！
Thank you.

857
01:15:01,769 --> 01:15:03,771
晚上好,先生Fauvel。
Bonsoir, Monsieur Fauvel.

858
01:15:05,639 --> 01:15:09,777
晚上好。我们不知道你是…我们只是路过。
Bonsoir. Um, we didn't know you were, uh... We were just passing.

859
01:15:10,978 --> 01:15:13,247
你们俩今晚有什么安排?
So, what are you two doing this evening?

860
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:15,182
——哦,嗯…哦。娜塔莎。
- Oh, well... Oh. - Natasha.

861
01:15:15,216 --> 01:15:17,318
我很抱歉。我必须走了。
I'm sorry. I-I must go.

862
01:15:17,351 --> 01:15:18,686
很高兴见到你。
It was great to see you.

863
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:20,788
哦,是的。再见,爱。
Oh, yeah. Ta-ta, love.

864
01:15:32,666 --> 01:15:34,935
我想这只是个摆设。
I think it's just for show.

865
01:15:35,803 --> 01:15:37,772
我不确定他是否适合结婚。
I'm not sure that he's the marrying kind.

866
01:15:37,805 --> 01:15:45,246
哈里斯太太，我求你了，在我被羞辱致死之前，你别再搞这一套了。-哦…请。够了!
Mrs. Harris, I-I beg of you, you-you need to stop this coupling thing -before I die of humiliation. -Oh... Please. Enough!

867
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:47,148
好吧。我不是聋子。
All right. I'm not deaf.

868
01:15:48,349 --> 01:15:50,084
我当然爱娜塔莎了。
Of course I'm in love with Natasha.

869
01:15:50,117 --> 01:15:51,685
我是说，谁不是呢?
I mean, who isn't?

870
01:15:51,719 --> 01:15:55,589
对不起，但生活不全是月光和电影。
I'm sorry, but life is not all moonlight and movies.

871
01:15:55,623 --> 01:15:57,224
为什么不能呢?
Why can't it be?

872
01:15:57,258 --> 01:16:00,194
我一个人待了太久，希望自己的生命快点结束。
I've spent too long on my own, wishing my life away.

873
01:16:00,227 --> 01:16:02,163
你不会想做同样的事情。
You don't want to do the same thing.

874
01:16:03,397 --> 01:16:07,768
哈里斯太太，我觉得你的浪漫梦想很适合巴黎。
Mrs. Harris, I think your dreams of romance fit Paris very well.

875
01:16:08,669 --> 01:16:12,573
原谅我，但也许是你想恋爱。
Forgive me, but perhaps it is you who wishes to be in love.

876
01:16:13,674 --> 01:16:15,843
你必须关注自己的内心。
You who must attend to your own heart.

877
01:16:22,683 --> 01:16:25,086
来吧，艾迪，说点什么，亲爱的。
Come on, Eddie, say something, love.

878
01:16:27,721 --> 01:16:30,991
试着理解一下，因为我做不到。
Try and make some sense of this, 'cause I can't.

879
01:16:36,397 --> 01:16:38,599
这都是你干的。
This is all your doing.

880
01:16:40,701 --> 01:16:43,637
准备好带你女朋友去巴黎。
Coming up with the readies to get your girl to Paris.

881
01:16:47,174 --> 01:16:48,876
巴黎。
Paris.

882
01:16:53,047 --> 01:16:54,949
满足一个人吗?
To meet someone?

883
01:16:59,153 --> 01:17:00,688
啊。
Ah.

884
01:17:03,157 --> 01:17:04,391
好吗?
Shall we?

885
01:17:17,104 --> 01:17:21,175
迪奥的姑娘们说我的裙子快做好了。
The girls at Dior say my dress is almost finished.

886
01:17:21,208 --> 01:17:23,644
是的。可能明天吧。
Yeah. Maybe tomorrow.

887
01:17:24,445 --> 01:17:27,148
然后我会…我要回家了。
And then I'll be... I'll be back off home.

888
01:17:31,252 --> 01:17:32,453
是的,它是可爱的。
Yeah, it's lovely.

889
01:17:32,486 --> 01:17:35,689
真的,真的可爱。
Really, really lovely.

890
01:17:35,723 --> 01:17:38,159
欢迎那个垃圾女人来她家。
That rubbish lady's welcome to hers.

891
01:17:39,426 --> 01:17:41,095
讽刺的是。
And here's the irony.

892
01:17:41,128 --> 01:17:50,037
迪奥先生为美丽的女人创作了精美的诗歌，赞美她们的清新和完美，却看到她们被老女人带走了。
Monsieur Dior makes exquisite poems for beautiful women in celebration of their freshness and perfection only to see them carried away by old frumps.

893
01:17:51,338 --> 01:17:53,073
就像那个可怕的阿瓦隆夫人。
Like that dreadful Madame Avallon.

894
01:17:53,107 --> 01:17:55,176
哦,是的。
Oh, yeah.

895
01:17:55,209 --> 01:18:03,217
然而，当然，也有一些人保持着某种难以言喻的魅力，一种难以言喻的诱惑。
Whereas, of course, there are those who retain a certain je ne sais quoi, an indefinable allure.

896
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:04,985
啊。
Ah.

897
01:18:05,019 --> 01:18:08,756
请允许我为您奉上一壶英国茶。
Allow me to present to you a pot of English tea.

898
01:18:08,789 --> 01:18:10,324
哦，就是这份工作。
Oh, just the job.

899
01:18:10,357 --> 01:18:12,393
嗯。谢谢,玛丽亚。
Hmm. Merci, Maria.

900
01:18:12,426 --> 01:18:14,795
现在我们让锅冲泡。
And now we let the pot brew.

901
01:18:14,828 --> 01:18:16,964
-这是正确的形式吗?——的票。
-Is that the correct form, yes? -That's the ticket.

902
01:18:16,997 --> 01:18:19,066
我得给你织个茶壶套。
I'll have to knit you a tea cozy.

903
01:18:20,067 --> 01:18:30,110
是的，出于我一直不清楚的原因，我在6岁时被送到温莎的一所寄宿学校，在那里我养成了喝茶和所有英国东西的习惯。
Yes, for reasons that were never clear to me, I was sent as a boy of six to a boarding school in Windsor, and that's where I acquired a taste for tea and of all things English.

904
01:18:31,245 --> 01:18:34,815
在等待的同时，我想让你看样东西。
While we wait, there's something I would like you to see.

905
01:18:34,848 --> 01:18:36,917
跟我来。
Come with me.

906
01:18:42,524 --> 01:18:43,891
在那里。
There.

907
01:18:43,924 --> 01:18:45,859
哦。哦。
Oh. Oh.

908
01:18:45,893 --> 01:18:48,095
才六岁，你这个可怜的小家伙。
Six years old, you poor mite.

909
01:18:48,128 --> 01:18:51,098
嗯，家里也好不到哪里去。
Well, home was not much better.

910
01:18:51,131 --> 01:18:52,499
但是，是的，我受苦了。
But yes, I suffered.

911
01:18:52,534 --> 01:18:54,902
我是个弱小的小男孩，总是被欺负。
I was a weak little boy, perpetually bullied.

912
01:18:54,935 --> 01:18:57,071
哦。
Oh.

913
01:18:58,138 --> 01:19:05,547
你知道吗，我一见到你，我就感觉到我内心的共鸣。
You know, as soon as I saw you, I felt this connection in my heart.

914
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:11,819
我不知道，也许吧……你的微笑，你的善良，你的……你的英语幽默。
I don't know, perhaps... your smile, your kindness, your... your English humor.

915
01:19:11,852 --> 01:19:17,157
我知道你让我想起了一个人，一个对我很重要的人，但是谁呢?
I knew you reminded me of someone, someone very dear to me, but who?

916
01:19:17,191 --> 01:19:24,532
直到昨天，当我翻看我的记忆时，我才意识到有一个人在照顾着我。
And only yesterday, as I searched my memories, did I realize there was a person who took care of me.

917
01:19:24,566 --> 01:19:31,506
她的生活是一种不知疲倦的苦役，但她还是找到时间安慰我，擦干我的眼泪。
Her life was one of tireless drudgery, and yet she found the time to comfort me and dry my tears.

918
01:19:31,539 --> 01:19:36,143
她叫马多克斯太太，但我们以前都叫她莫普斯太太。
Her name was Mrs. Maddox, but we used to call her Mrs. Mops.

919
01:19:36,176 --> 01:19:37,911
在那里。
There.

920
01:19:41,949 --> 01:19:45,286
我让你想起了莫普斯太太?
I-I remind you of Mrs. Mops?

921
01:19:45,319 --> 01:19:47,354
——啊,是的。——清洁吗?
-Ah, yes. -The cleaner?

922
01:19:48,322 --> 01:19:54,361
莫普斯太太擦干我的眼泪，让我重新微笑起来，就像你这几天做的那样，哈里斯太太。
Mrs. Mops dried my tears and made me smile again, as you have, Mrs. Harris, these past few days.

923
01:19:55,929 --> 01:19:59,233
我真希望我的戴尔芬能认识你。
I do wish my Delphine could have known you.

924
01:20:00,602 --> 01:20:06,006
你们看，你们安慰有需要的人，却不求回报。
You see, you give comfort to those in need without asking anything in return.

925
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:08,842
是这样吗?
Is that right?

926
01:20:09,943 --> 01:20:12,046
你是这么看我的吗?
Is that how you see me?

927
01:20:12,079 --> 01:20:14,281
你知道我们之间为什么有联系了吧?
You see why there is a connection between us?

928
01:20:16,317 --> 01:20:20,454
现在，让我们来喝一杯英国茶，好吗?
Now, let's have a nice cup of English tea, shall we?

929
01:20:20,487 --> 01:20:24,291
不用了，谢谢。
Uh, no, thank you.

930
01:20:25,627 --> 01:20:27,194
我最好还是走吧。
I'd best be getting along.

931
01:20:27,227 --> 01:20:29,330
他们在沙龙等我。
They're expecting me at the salon.

932
01:21:11,939 --> 01:21:13,474
玛格丽特?
Marguerite?

933
01:21:15,409 --> 01:21:16,944
有什么事吗?
What's the matter?

934
01:21:23,384 --> 01:21:25,052
在你去。
In you go.

935
01:21:27,488 --> 01:21:29,691
你放了这些女孩是怎么回事?
What's this about you letting all these girls go?

936
01:21:29,724 --> 01:21:31,024
哦。你没事吧，亲爱的?
Ooh. You all right, love?

937
01:21:31,058 --> 01:21:34,461
如果他们像你一样免费工作，那就没有必要了。
It would not be necessary if they worked for free, as you do.

938
01:21:34,495 --> 01:21:37,264
他们需要自己的工作。他们还要养家糊口。
They need their jobs. They've got families to feed.

939
01:21:37,297 --> 01:21:38,365
Excusez-moi。
Excusez-moi.

940
01:21:38,399 --> 01:21:41,603
是的，这很令人难过，但这与你无关。
Yes, it is very sad, but this is not of your concern.

941
01:21:41,636 --> 01:21:43,404
好吧，我们走着瞧。
Well, we'll see about that.

942
01:21:43,437 --> 01:21:47,307
拜托，夫人，你已经查遍了这里的每一个角落。
Please, madame, you have reached into every corner of this establishment.

943
01:21:47,341 --> 01:21:50,545
我坚持要求你尊重我们的隐私。
Now, I insist that you respect our privacy.

944
01:21:50,578 --> 01:21:52,012
嗯。
Hmm.

945
01:21:52,045 --> 01:21:53,648
你要去哪儿，哈里斯太太?
Where are you going, Mrs. Harris?

946
01:21:53,681 --> 01:21:55,449
去见老板。
To see the boss.

947
01:21:55,482 --> 01:21:57,351
你不能。不  -来吧，姑娘们。
-You cannot. No. -Come on, girls.

948
01:21:57,384 --> 01:21:59,486
——请。没有。,跟我来。轻快地,急速地。
- Please. No. - Follow me. Vite, vite.

949
01:22:03,157 --> 01:22:04,559
来吧，姑娘们。来吧。
Here we go, girls. Come on.

950
01:22:04,592 --> 01:22:05,959
下来的工具。
Down tools.

951
01:22:05,993 --> 01:22:07,995
来吧，到我后面去。加入我们的行列。
Come on, get behind me. Join us.

952
01:22:08,028 --> 01:22:09,564
是啊，今天有个很重要的工作。
Yeah, got a really important job today.

953
01:22:09,597 --> 01:22:11,298
-哦，你看起来很可爱，但别这样。夫人。哈里斯!
-Ooh, you look lovely, but come on. -Mrs. Harris!

954
01:22:11,331 --> 01:22:13,967
-来帮我做这件事。夫人。哈里斯!
-Come and do this for me. -Mrs. Harris!

955
01:22:14,001 --> 01:22:15,670
你必须马上停止这一切。
You must stop this at once.

956
01:22:15,703 --> 01:22:17,505
你根本不知道自己在做什么。
You have no idea what you are doing.

957
01:22:17,539 --> 01:22:18,972
哦，是的，我喜欢。
Oh, yes, I do.

958
01:22:19,006 --> 01:22:20,374
这叫罢工。
It's called a strike.

959
01:22:22,577 --> 01:22:24,144
好了，女士们，来吧。
Right, ladies, come on.

960
01:22:24,178 --> 01:22:26,113
跟我来。没时间了，亲爱的。
Follow me. No time for that, dear.

961
01:22:26,146 --> 01:22:28,382
Oi !没必要推推搡搡。来吧。
Oi! No need to push and shove. Come on.

962
01:22:34,087 --> 01:22:36,957
站起来，André。有工作要做。
On your feet, André. There's work to be done.

963
01:22:48,402 --> 01:22:50,605
哈里斯太太，我求你了，别这么做。
Mrs. Harris, I beg of you, do not do this.

964
01:22:50,638 --> 01:22:58,445
这是你的机会，André，你一生中有多少机会?-不,看…迪奥先生，请占用您十分钟时间。
This is your chance, André, and how many chances -do you get in your lifetime? -No, look... Monsieur Dior, ten minutes of your time, please.

965
01:22:58,479 --> 01:23:01,448
这就是福维尔先生拯救公司所需要的一切。
That's all Mr. Fauvel needs to save the company.

966
01:23:01,482 --> 01:23:07,454
我吗?我怎么…继续,宠物。你能做到的。告诉他你的计划。
Me? What do I-I... Go on, pet. You can do it. Tell him your plan.

967
01:23:07,488 --> 01:23:09,456
-嗯……——去。
-Uh... -Go on.

968
01:23:22,670 --> 01:23:29,777
而不是世界来到蒙田大道，迪奥必须走出世界，为所有人提供一系列的商品。
Rather than the world coming to Avenue Montaigne, Dior must go out to the world with a range of goods available to all.

969
01:23:29,811 --> 01:23:36,383
香水，丝袜，奢侈品…普通女人都能负担得起。
Uh, perfume, stockings, luxury that... that the ordinary woman can afford.

970
01:23:45,292 --> 01:23:46,426
是的。
Oui.

971
01:23:51,833 --> 01:23:53,300
什么?
What?

972
01:23:54,536 --> 01:23:56,336
哦,对了。
Oh, right.

973
01:23:56,370 --> 01:23:58,438
祝你好运,爱。
Good luck, love.

974
01:24:23,731 --> 01:24:25,465
谢谢。
Merci.

975
01:24:52,894 --> 01:24:59,701
但今天，出现了一个新的女性，一个现代女性，她知道自己想要什么，并且需要有能力购买它。
But today, there's a new woman, a modern woman who knows what she wants and needs to be able to buy it.

976
01:24:59,734 --> 01:25:02,235
今天，请来了哈里斯太太。
Today, there's Mrs. Harris.

977
01:25:02,269 --> 01:25:04,171
哦。
Oh.

978
01:25:04,204 --> 01:25:11,512
maître同意我们的计划意味着，我们将需要更多的工作，而不是失去工作。
The maître's agreement to our plan means that, far from losing jobs, we will need more.

979
01:25:11,546 --> 01:25:13,881
很多很多更多。
Many, many more.

980
01:25:24,525 --> 01:25:26,259
万岁!
Bravo!

981
01:25:48,516 --> 01:25:50,450
你确定是这条街吗?
Are you sure this is the right street?

982
01:25:50,484 --> 01:25:53,253
必须。这是我每个月给她寄支票的地方。
Must be. This is where I send her check every month.

983
01:25:53,286 --> 01:25:54,922
里面不会有一点灰尘。
There won't be a speck of dust inside.

984
01:25:54,956 --> 01:25:57,357
你可以用你的生命打赌。
You can bet your life.

985
01:25:58,225 --> 01:26:01,294
这是它。
This is it.

986
01:26:06,901 --> 01:26:08,201
没有。
No.

987
01:26:08,235 --> 01:26:09,570
让我安静点。
Leave me in peace.

988
01:26:09,604 --> 01:26:10,772
只是一个字。
Just a word.

989
01:26:10,805 --> 01:26:12,974
为什么?我承认。
Why? I concede.

990
01:26:13,007 --> 01:26:15,442
胜利属于你，哈里斯太太。
The victory is yours, Mrs. Harris.

991
01:26:39,634 --> 01:26:43,705
我丈夫，他在战争中受伤了。
My husband-- he was damaged in the war.

992
01:26:43,738 --> 01:26:45,272
他需要经常照顾。
He requires constant care.

993
01:26:45,305 --> 01:26:47,642
你要么做，要么付钱。
Which you either do or pay for.

994
01:26:47,675 --> 01:26:49,443
难怪你有那么多正面。
No wonder you got all that front on you.

995
01:26:49,476 --> 01:26:51,546
请说你想说的。
Say what you want, please.

996
01:26:51,579 --> 01:26:54,582
夫人，我很抱歉冒犯了你。
Madame, I'm so sorry to have offended you.

997
01:26:54,615 --> 01:27:03,725
我非常尊重你，我从来没有想过要强迫你改变……你描述的未来很有意义，但我不想参与其中。
I hold you in the highest regard, and it was never my intention to force a change on... The future you describe makes perfect sense, but I want no part of it.

998
01:27:03,758 --> 01:27:05,860
哦,不,请。
Uh, no, please.

999
01:27:05,893 --> 01:27:07,360
你绝不能想到离开。
You must not think of leaving.

1000
01:27:07,394 --> 01:27:12,499
也许我在这个岗位上呆得太久了，太久了，我是伟人背后的隐形女人。
Perhaps I have been too long in my post, too long the invisible woman behind the great man.

1001
01:27:12,533 --> 01:27:14,001
战斗说话。
Fighting talk.

1002
01:27:14,035 --> 01:27:15,570
你走到哪里,女孩。
You go, girl.

1003
01:27:15,603 --> 01:27:19,874
我不像你是革命者，哈里斯太太。
I'm not a revolutionary like you, Mrs. Harris.

1004
01:27:19,907 --> 01:27:22,442
我只想一个人待着。
I simply wish to be left alone.

1005
01:27:23,376 --> 01:27:30,585
嗯,那是……这些都很好，上帝知道这是你应得的，但你知道没有你，一切都会崩溃，不是吗?
Well, that's... that's all fine and dandy, and Lord knows you deserve it, but you know it'll fall apart without you, don't you?

1006
01:27:30,618 --> 01:27:32,720
相信我，我见过很多次了。
Trust me, I've seen it over and over.

1007
01:27:32,754 --> 01:27:36,624
当女士起身离开时，男士不会坚持十分钟。
When the lady ups and leaves, the gent don't last ten minutes.

1008
01:27:37,759 --> 01:27:39,694
你需要的。
You're needed.

1009
01:27:39,727 --> 01:27:41,662
现在更是如此。
Now more than ever.

1010
01:27:41,696 --> 01:27:44,331
还有谁能让这一切保持原样?
Who else is gonna keep things up to scratch?

1011
01:27:44,364 --> 01:27:46,701
不是André或迪奥先生。
Not André or Monsieur Dior.

1012
01:27:46,734 --> 01:27:49,537
两个男人知道什么?
What would two men know about that?

1013
01:27:50,538 --> 01:27:53,808
你和我，你知道，我们是一模一样的。
You and me, you know, we're two peas in a pod.

1014
01:27:53,841 --> 01:27:57,912
我们清理每个人的混乱，使花园的一切可爱。
We clean up everybody's mess and make everything in the garden lovely.

1015
01:27:57,945 --> 01:27:59,446
我们是他们的依靠。
We're the ones they rely on.

1016
01:27:59,479 --> 01:28:05,385
他们甚至不知道我们在做什么，但就像鸡蛋一样确定，没有我们，一切都会变糟。
They don't even know what we do, but as sure as eggs is eggs, without us, it all goes tits up.

1017
01:28:11,959 --> 01:28:16,396
也许需要和le maître谈一谈。
Perhaps a conversation with le maître is required.

1018
01:28:18,132 --> 01:28:20,601
也许。
Perhaps.

1019
01:28:21,702 --> 01:28:24,539
明天，你告诉娜塔莎你的感受。
And tomorrow, you tell Natasha how you feel.

1020
01:28:24,572 --> 01:28:27,108
但是娜塔莎小姐已经离开迪奥了。
Oh, but Mademoiselle Natasha has left Dior.

1021
01:28:27,141 --> 01:28:29,544
她的离开巴黎。
She's leaving Paris.

1022
01:28:29,577 --> 01:28:33,648
和你一样，哈里斯太太，她也想追随自己的梦想。
Like you, Mrs. Harris, she wishes to follow her dream.

1023
01:28:38,553 --> 01:28:40,453
继续找,爱。她一定在这附近。
Keep looking, love. She's got to be here somewhere.

1024
01:28:40,487 --> 01:28:42,089
她走了。这是最好的选择。
She's gone. It's for the best.

1025
01:28:42,123 --> 01:28:48,095
如果你不这样做，你马上就会被狠狠地揍一顿。坚持下去。
You're gonna get yourself a good clip round the ear in a minute if you don't... Hang on.

1026
01:28:48,129 --> 01:28:50,463
等一下。我知道。
Hang on a minute. I know.

1027
01:29:00,041 --> 01:29:01,576
这里。
Here.

1028
01:29:03,978 --> 01:29:05,646
哦。
Oh.

1029
01:29:06,647 --> 01:29:07,648
哦。
Oh.

1030
01:29:07,682 --> 01:29:09,717
哦。夫人迪奥。
Oh. Madame Dior.

1031
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:10,985
Magnifique。
Magnifique.

1032
01:29:11,018 --> 01:29:13,721
哦，好吧，你自己也不错。
Oh, well, not so bad yourself.

1033
01:29:15,455 --> 01:29:17,658
我们在找一个女孩。
Uh, we're looking for a girl.

1034
01:29:17,692 --> 01:29:21,762
嗯,她是……她有点不高兴。
Um, she's... she's a bit upset.

1035
01:29:22,763 --> 01:29:23,898
嗯…
Um...

1036
01:29:26,901 --> 01:29:29,604
她是迪奥的模特。
She's a Dior model.

1037
01:29:33,541 --> 01:29:35,442
-哦,娜塔莎。娜塔莎。
-Oh, Natasha. -Natasha.

1038
01:29:41,716 --> 01:29:44,018
这种生活，不适合我。
This life, it's-it's not for me.

1039
01:29:44,051 --> 01:29:46,020
不，当然不是。
No, of course it isn't.

1040
01:29:46,053 --> 01:29:49,190
被困在底座上，像个漂亮的洋娃娃一样被游行。
Stuck on a pedestal, paraded around like a beautiful doll.

1041
01:29:49,223 --> 01:29:52,026
谁都看得出来她不想要。
Anyone can see the girl doesn't want it.

1042
01:29:52,059 --> 01:29:54,461
哈里斯太太说得对。
Mrs. Harris is right.

1043
01:29:54,494 --> 01:29:56,496
我不是这样的人。
It's not who I am.

1044
01:29:56,530 --> 01:30:02,770
正如萨特所说，你会发现自己在être-en-soi和être-pour-soi之间存在矛盾。
As Sartre would say, y-you find yourself conflicted between être-en-soi et être-pour-soi.

1045
01:30:03,671 --> 01:30:05,907
介于"自为"和"自在"之间
Between "for itself" and "in itself."

1046
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:13,648
Être-en-soi是人类生活中涉及意识的那些方面，而物理事实则是être-pour-soi。
Être-en-soi being those aspects of human life that involves consciousness, whereas physical facts are être-pour-soi.

1047
01:30:16,483 --> 01:30:19,053
在这种情况下，事物就会变成原来的样子。
In which case, things would be what they are not.

1048
01:30:19,086 --> 01:30:20,688
完全一样。
Exactement.

1049
01:30:20,721 --> 01:30:24,926
事物是它不是的东西，而不是它不是的东西。
Things are what they are not, and they're not what they're not.

1050
01:30:30,665 --> 01:30:34,235
André，看在上帝的份上，亲她就行了。
André, for God's sake, just kiss her.

1051
01:30:34,268 --> 01:30:36,871
是的。看在上帝的份上，吻我吧。
Yes. For God's sake, just kiss me.

1052
01:30:40,007 --> 01:30:41,876
嗯。
Hmm.

1053
01:31:02,863 --> 01:31:05,700
你没在巴黎找到真爱吗，迪奥夫人?
You did not find love in Paris, Madame Dior?

1054
01:31:05,733 --> 01:31:08,602
-哦,不。没有。——哦。
- Oh, no. No. - Oh.

1055
01:31:11,272 --> 01:31:17,878
我以为已经太晚了，但是... ...现在我不那么确定了。
I thought it was too late, but... ...now I'm not so sure.

1056
01:32:16,370 --> 01:32:18,672
——你好,爱。——你好,艾达。
- Hello, love. - Hello, Ada.

1057
01:32:54,108 --> 01:32:57,678
哦。好吧，好吧。
Oh. All right, all right.

1058
01:32:57,711 --> 01:32:59,013
戈登·班尼特。
Gordon Bennett.

1059
01:32:59,046 --> 01:33:01,315
好吧。
All right.

1060
01:33:01,348 --> 01:33:03,184
好吧。
All right.

1061
01:33:03,217 --> 01:33:04,685
哦,你好,爱。进来。
Oh, hello, love. Come in.

1062
01:33:04,718 --> 01:33:06,087
谢天谢地你回来了。
Oh, thank God you're back.

1063
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:07,388
哦，好吧，没多久。
Oh, well, not long.

1064
01:33:07,421 --> 01:33:08,956
你想喝杯茶吗?
Do you want a cuppa?

1065
01:33:08,989 --> 01:33:10,391
没有时间。
No time.

1066
01:33:10,424 --> 01:33:12,726
-这是紧急情况-哦。正确的。
-This is an emergency. -Oh. Right.

1067
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:15,629
好吧，深呼吸，告诉我怎么回事。
Okay, well, deep breath and tell me what's up.

1068
01:33:15,663 --> 01:33:21,635
我不能去，但如果我不去…你知道吗，给人留下好印象很重要?
I can't go, but if I don't... Oh, it's so important to make a good impression, you know?

1069
01:33:21,669 --> 01:33:23,871
我做的事。你想给谁留下好印象?
I do. Who you trying to impress?

1070
01:33:23,904 --> 01:33:25,840
制片人科恩戈尔德先生。
Mr. Korngold, the producer.

1071
01:33:25,873 --> 01:33:28,242
我要和他一起去Café皇家酒店参加晚宴。
I'm to partner him to the big dinner at the Café Royal.

1072
01:33:28,275 --> 01:33:30,177
-哦。-每个人都会去。
-Ooh. -Everybody will be there.

1073
01:33:30,211 --> 01:33:32,146
这是一个无价的机会。
It's a priceless opportunity.

1074
01:33:32,179 --> 01:33:33,848
但看。
But look.

1075
01:33:38,085 --> 01:33:43,724
哦，是啊，是有点…有点皱巴巴的，但我们可以马上蒸出来，亲爱的。
Oh, well, yeah, it's a bit... it's a bit crumpled, but we can steam that out in a jiffy, love.

1076
01:33:43,757 --> 01:33:45,893
你不要担心。-不,看。
-Don't you worry. -No, look.

1077
01:33:45,926 --> 01:33:47,094
哦。
Oh.

1078
01:33:47,995 --> 01:33:51,932
哦,亲爱的。是啊，不好好泡一泡是洗不出来的。
Oh, dear. Yeah, that's not gonna come out without a good, long soak.

1079
01:33:51,966 --> 01:33:54,702
我不知道缎子会不会喜欢。
I'm not sure the satin's gonna like that.

1080
01:33:54,735 --> 01:33:55,903
你没有别的了吗?
Ain't you got another one?

1081
01:33:55,936 --> 01:33:57,171
那件可爱的蓝色连衣裙怎么样?
What about that lovely blue dress?

1082
01:33:57,204 --> 01:33:59,240
-在洗衣店。-哦。
-It's at the cleaner's. -Oh.

1083
01:33:59,273 --> 01:34:01,142
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my God.

1084
01:34:01,175 --> 01:34:03,878
我要死了。
I'm going to die.

1085
01:34:03,911 --> 01:34:05,880
好吧。来吧,现在。这就够了。
All right. Come on, now. That's enough.

1086
01:34:05,913 --> 01:34:08,382
没人想听。
Nobody wants to hear that.

1087
01:34:08,415 --> 01:34:10,417
但你不明白。
But you don't understand.

1088
01:34:10,451 --> 01:34:13,220
科恩戈尔德的女孩几乎都成了明星。
Nearly all Mr. Korngold's girls become stars.

1089
01:34:13,254 --> 01:34:18,726
这是我摆脱窠臼的机会，让自己最终被人看到。
It's my chance to lift myself out of the rut and be seen at last.

1090
01:34:18,759 --> 01:34:21,395
被人看见并不代表一切，亲爱的。
Well, being seen isn't everything, love.

1091
01:34:21,428 --> 01:34:24,131
对我来说是。
It is for me.

1092
01:34:37,211 --> 01:34:39,813
来吧。站起来。
Come on. Stand up.

1093
01:34:39,847 --> 01:34:41,248
今天是你的幸运日。
It's your lucky day.

1094
01:34:41,282 --> 01:34:43,217
什么?
What?

1095
01:34:43,250 --> 01:34:44,818
为什么?
Why?

1096
01:34:45,452 --> 01:34:46,954
因为我想我能帮你。
'Cause I think I can help you.

1097
01:34:46,987 --> 01:34:48,455
你刚说你不能。
You just said you couldn't.

1098
01:34:48,489 --> 01:34:51,225
如果你不起来，我什么也做不了。
I can't do anything if you don't get up.

1099
01:34:55,963 --> 01:34:56,931
正确的。
Right.

1100
01:34:56,964 --> 01:34:59,833
脱掉你的衣服。你可以借我的衣服。
Take off your clothes. You can borrow my dress.

1101
01:35:03,170 --> 01:35:04,805
别荒谬。
Don't be ridiculous.

1102
01:35:04,838 --> 01:35:07,441
照我说的做，少说点废话。
Just do as I say, and a bit less of your nonsense.

1103
01:35:07,474 --> 01:35:09,743
走吧，到屏幕后面去。
Go on, behind the screen.

1104
01:35:18,252 --> 01:35:20,087
哈里斯太太吗?
Mrs. Harris?

1105
01:35:27,194 --> 01:35:29,163
哦。
Oh.

1106
01:35:29,196 --> 01:35:31,432
你们看起来很可爱，鸭子们。
You look lovely, ducks.

1107
01:35:31,465 --> 01:35:33,867
只是机票。
Just the ticket.

1108
01:35:34,935 --> 01:35:36,837
你的旅行怎么样?我应该问。
How was your trip? I should've asked.

1109
01:35:36,870 --> 01:35:38,973
-你去哪儿了?-哦。
-Where did you go? -Oh.

1110
01:35:39,006 --> 01:35:42,109
巴黎。是的,它是……你说过你只离开一天。
Paris. Yeah, it was... You said you'd only be gone a day.

1111
01:35:42,142 --> 01:35:44,345
没有你，一切都毁了。
Everything went to pieces without you.

1112
01:35:44,378 --> 01:35:45,813
这是不可思议的。
It was magical.

1113
01:35:45,846 --> 01:35:48,449
你知道我平时有多爱整洁。
I mean, you know how tidy I am-- normally.

1114
01:35:48,482 --> 01:35:50,150
那么浪漫。
So romantic.

1115
01:35:51,151 --> 01:35:52,486
太太H。
Mrs. H.

1116
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:54,121
你的黑马。
You dark horse.

1117
01:35:54,154 --> 01:35:56,123
哦。
Oh.

1118
01:35:57,559 --> 01:35:58,993
哦,上帝。这是他。
Oh, God. That's him.

1119
01:35:59,026 --> 01:36:01,996
哦。那么，他知道该去哪儿了?
Oh. He knew where to come, then?

1120
01:36:02,830 --> 01:36:05,266
我就知道你会救我，亲爱的。
I knew you'd rescue me, darling.

1121
01:36:05,299 --> 01:36:06,534
你是我的仙女教母。
You're my fairy godmother.

1122
01:36:37,464 --> 01:36:39,300
你好。
Hello.

1123
01:36:50,144 --> 01:36:51,945
彭罗斯小姐吗?
Miss Penrose?

1124
01:36:53,548 --> 01:36:55,949
哦。
Oh.

1125
01:37:22,109 --> 01:37:26,246
亲爱的H太太，很抱歉这件衣服，但请不要担心。
Dear Mrs. H, Sorry about the dress, but please don't worry.

1126
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:27,414
我很好。
I'm okay.

1127
01:37:31,018 --> 01:37:36,457
我正对着镜子检查我的口红，突然全身着火了。
I was checking my lipstick in the mirror when suddenly I went up in flames.

1128
01:37:42,996 --> 01:37:47,368
如果不是一个乐于助人的朋友来救我，我可能已经被烧成脆皮了。
I might have burnt to a crisp if a helpful friend hadn't come to my rescue.

1129
01:37:53,541 --> 01:37:56,276
科恩戈尔德先生说我应该起诉。
Mr. Korngold says I should sue.

1130
01:37:57,478 --> 01:37:59,313
去我妈妈家休养了。
Gone to my mum's to recover.

1131
01:39:56,731 --> 01:39:58,365
艾达?
Ada?

1132
01:39:58,398 --> 01:40:00,100
你在吗?
You there?

1133
01:40:01,703 --> 01:40:03,738
是的。
Yeah.

1134
01:40:03,771 --> 01:40:05,507
对不起,Vi。
Sorry, Vi.

1135
01:40:12,547 --> 01:40:15,650
你放弃了吗，女人?
You give up the ghost, woman?

1136
01:40:15,683 --> 01:40:18,252
你想把我们吓死吗?
You want to scare us to death?

1137
01:40:18,285 --> 01:40:20,254
好吧，阿奇?
Oh, all right, Archie?

1138
01:40:20,855 --> 01:40:23,725
抱歉弄坏了你的门。
Uh, sorry about your door.

1139
01:40:23,758 --> 01:40:28,095
呃，她是…最好的意图。
Uh, she was, um... Best intentions and all.

1140
01:40:31,533 --> 01:40:33,801
我去拿杯玻璃杯，好吗?
I'll get some glass, yeah?

1141
01:40:33,835 --> 01:40:35,803
把它修理得像新的一样。
Fix it up good as new.

1142
01:40:35,837 --> 01:40:37,271
谢谢你！
Thank you.

1143
01:40:50,350 --> 01:40:52,787
好吧，没必要说什么。
Well, there's no need to say a word.

1144
01:40:52,820 --> 01:40:54,589
你是著名的。
You're famous.

1145
01:40:54,622 --> 01:40:58,125
至少你放弃一切去买的那条裙子是。
At least the dress you gave up everything to go and get is.

1146
01:40:58,158 --> 01:41:01,261
你为什么要给那个没用的女孩?
Why you give it to that no-good girl, eh?

1147
01:41:01,295 --> 01:41:04,666
你太软弱了，这是事实。
You're too soft, and that's the truth.

1148
01:41:05,667 --> 01:41:08,068
它必须被看到。
It had to be seen.

1149
01:41:08,836 --> 01:41:11,071
只有正确的。
It's only right.

1150
01:41:12,472 --> 01:41:14,709
哦,六世。
Oh, Vi.

1151
01:41:14,742 --> 01:41:17,277
我一直没能穿上它。
I never got to wear it.

1152
01:41:17,912 --> 01:41:19,614
甚至没有一次。
Not even once.

1153
01:41:20,615 --> 01:41:23,551
哦，艾达，亲爱的。
Oh, Ada, my darling.

1154
01:41:24,552 --> 01:41:27,454
我很抱歉，嗯?
I'm so sorry, eh?

1155
01:41:28,590 --> 01:41:30,357
嘿。
Hey.

1156
01:41:30,390 --> 01:41:32,694
我们不需要华丽的礼服。
We don't need no fancy dresses.

1157
01:41:32,727 --> 01:41:40,100
我们去军团舞会上摇尾羽，他们都会看着我们的。
We'll go shake our tail feather down at the Legion Dance, and they'll all be looking at us.

1158
01:41:42,770 --> 01:41:44,371
哦。
Aw.

1159
01:41:49,844 --> 01:41:51,613
早上好，纽科姆先生。
Oh, morning, Mr. Newcombe.

1160
01:41:51,646 --> 01:41:52,880
假期愉快吗，哈里斯太太?
Enjoy your holiday, Mrs. Harris?

1161
01:41:52,914 --> 01:41:54,247
非常感谢。
Very much, thank you.

1162
01:41:54,281 --> 01:41:56,216
想念你对这地方的感觉。
Missed your touch about the place.

1163
01:41:56,249 --> 01:41:57,885
哦。
Oh.

1164
01:41:57,919 --> 01:41:59,687
你还好吗?
Are you quite all right?

1165
01:42:01,656 --> 01:42:03,490
今天不太舒服。
Not quite meself today.

1166
01:42:04,324 --> 01:42:06,360
甚至不知道那是谁。
Not sure who that is, even.

1167
01:42:06,393 --> 01:42:09,496
有点生存危机。
Bit of an existential crisis.

1168
01:42:10,297 --> 01:42:12,634
巴黎会这样对待你的。
Paris will do that to you.

1169
01:42:12,667 --> 01:42:14,636
振作点，H太太。
Chin up, Mrs. H.

1170
01:42:14,669 --> 01:42:16,771
革命即将到来。
The revolution is coming.

1171
01:42:49,837 --> 01:42:53,574
你读过那个穿着迪奥礼服自焚的女孩吗?
Did you read about the girl who set fire to herself in a Dior gown?

1172
01:42:53,608 --> 01:42:57,679
我想这是可怕的宣传噱头。
Ghastly publicity stunt, I suppose.

1173
01:42:57,712 --> 01:43:00,347
这是多么的浪费。
What a waste.

1174
01:43:06,386 --> 01:43:08,723
你能接受我的通知吗，唐顿夫人?
Will you please accept my notice, Lady Dant?

1175
01:43:10,390 --> 01:43:14,729
我要求你在本周末之前全部结清你的账目。
I will require full and final settlement of your account by the end of the week.

1176
01:43:14,762 --> 01:43:15,830
你不能离开我。
You can't leave me.

1177
01:43:16,998 --> 01:43:21,636
你可以像对待人渣一样对待别人并期望得到忠诚回报的日子已经过去了。
Them days are over when you can treat people like scum and expect loyalty in return.

1178
01:43:23,470 --> 01:43:25,740
是的。美好的一天,夫人。
Yeah. Good day, milady.

1179
01:43:27,340 --> 01:43:29,242
那就这样吧。
There you go.

1180
01:43:31,278 --> 01:43:33,715
马上就好了。
Be right as rain in no time.

1181
01:43:35,650 --> 01:43:37,819
那是谁呢?
Who's that, then?

1182
01:43:43,658 --> 01:43:44,859
Ada哈里斯夫人?
Mrs. Ada Harris?

1183
01:43:44,892 --> 01:43:47,360
请在这里‘。-哦。
-Sign here, please. -Oh.

1184
01:43:53,568 --> 01:43:55,970
-谢谢。——莫”。有更多的。
-Thank you. -Just a mo'. There's more.

1185
01:43:56,003 --> 01:43:57,538
更多?
More?

1186
01:44:02,877 --> 01:44:04,779
哦。
Oh.

1187
01:44:05,646 --> 01:44:07,380
你确定吗?今天不是我的生日。
Are you sure? It's not me birthday.

1188
01:44:07,414 --> 01:44:08,716
你是艾达·哈里斯吗?
You are Ada Harris?

1189
01:44:08,750 --> 01:44:11,284
嗯，我也不确定。
Well, not sure about that, either.

1190
01:45:00,001 --> 01:45:09,510
Chère哈里斯夫人，我们希望您返回伦敦的旅途愉快，但我们被社交版上的一张照片所困扰。
Chère Madame Harris, We hope your return journey to London was pleasant, but we were troubled by a photo we saw in the social pages.

1191
01:45:09,544 --> 01:45:14,582
我们立刻意识到你又一次太好了。
We knew immediately that once again you had been too kind.

1192
01:45:16,851 --> 01:45:21,421
看来垃圾大王是在偷工人的东西。
It seems the rubbish king was stealing from his workers.

1193
01:45:21,454 --> 01:45:23,490
乔治!乔治!
Georges! Georges!

1194
01:45:23,524 --> 01:45:29,864
自从他的资产被查封后，阿瓦隆夫人就没能参加最后一次试衣，也没能付清礼服的账单。
Since his assets were seized, Madame Avallon failed to attend her final fitting or settle the bill for her dress.

1195
01:45:30,865 --> 01:45:35,903
当然，我们保留了你所有的尺寸，很快就能为你修改。
We kept all your measurements, of course, and were quickly able to alter it for you.

1196
01:45:35,937 --> 01:45:41,008
如果它需要任何最后的调整，我们知道你有能力自己做这些。
If it needs any final adjustments, we know you have the skill to do these yourself.

1197
01:45:45,112 --> 01:45:48,115
我们都认为这是我们最起码能做的。
We all agreed it was the least we could do.

1198
01:45:48,149 --> 01:45:51,384
宣传的结果是订单大大增加。
The publicity has resulted in a great increase in orders.

1199
01:45:58,993 --> 01:46:03,898
毫无疑问，你会认出这些花是玛格丽特公主的花蕾。
You will no doubt recognize these blooms as Princess Margaret's Delight.

1200
01:46:03,931 --> 01:46:10,771
我们希望你喜欢这些花，也希望你的新衣服远离明火。
