你想对她好点。

她只是去赢了赌局而已。

139
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:19,721
艾达，你打算怎么办?

If you know of anyone who could use me services... um... one of your nieces, perhaps?

155
00:16:20,214 --> 00:16:22,684
萨曼莎，H夫人是谨慎的化身。
Samantha, Mrs. H is the soul of discretion.

156
00:16:22,717 --> 00:16:25,787
要不是我把我的把手擦得锃亮，谁也不会知道她是谁。
One would never know she'd been but for the polish on my knobs.

157
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,021

试镜的事很抱歉，亲爱的。

161
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:11,893
我不知道我为什么要麻烦你。
Oh, I don't know why I bother.

162
00:18:11,926 --> 00:18:14,494
“太年轻”。“太老了”。
"Too young." "Too old."

163
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:16,831
“太高了”。“太胖。”

164
00:18:16,864 --> 00:18:18,600
你说得对，宝贝儿。

165
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:21,201
我二十岁……三。

166
00:18:21,903 --> 00:18:23,838
再过几年，我就完了。

哦，你的时间很充裕。
Oh, you've plenty of time.

你无法想象这是什么感觉，哈里斯太太，总是担心自己的外表。
You can't imagine what it's like, Mrs. Harris, always having to worry about your looks.

169
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:38,519
灰姑娘，你为什么带破衣服来?
Hey, Cinderella, why'd you bring them rags?

170
00:18:38,553 --> 00:18:42,657
我要去参加舞会……等我穿好衣服。
I will go to the ball... when I get me dress.

171
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:45,492
麻烦来了，大写的" a "
Oh, here comes trouble with a capital "A."

172
00:18:45,526 --> 00:18:46,493
你好,阿奇。

00:18:46,527 --> 00:18:48,495
艾达，我要找的那个女孩。
Ada, the very girl I was after.

174
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:50,440
-我能为你做什么，宝贝儿?-别让我激动
- What can I do for you, ducks? - Now, don't get me excited.

175
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:51,866
你知道我心脏不好。
You know I've got a dodgy ticker.

176
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:53,300
哦，走开。

177
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,737
她比你有更大的计划。
She got bigger plans than you.

178
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,170
我看得出来。
I can see that.

179
00:18:57,204 --> 00:19:00,551
你能帮我个忙照看一下春夏吗?
So, would you mind doing me a favor and look after Spring and Summer?

180
00:19:00,575 --> 00:19:05,245
辛西娅，因为狗并不是最好的朋友。
Because Cynthia there's not exactly a dog's best friend.

181
00:19:07,949 --> 00:19:09,449
继续。

182
00:19:10,985 --> 00:19:13,186

191

请原谅，夫人。

夫人，这是我的账户。

我想知道你能不能结账。

195
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:56,898
哦，我很抱歉，哈里斯太太。

196
00:19:56,931 --> 00:19:58,866
恐怕我忘记去银行了。

197
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,367
这场婚礼简直是噩梦。
This wedding is a nightmare.

198
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,770
每个人都说可以。
Everybody has said yes.

199
00:20:02,804 --> 00:20:07,240
哦,嗯…你不会介意等到下个星期吧?
Oh, um... you wouldn't mind waiting until next week, would you?

200
00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:14,649
呃，事情是这样的，现在有点紧迫，因为我需要…哦，是这个时间吗?
Well, uh, the thing is, it's become a bit pressing because I need to... Oh, is that the time?

201
00:20:14,682 --> 00:20:19,520
事实上，哈里斯太太，恐怕我要减少你的工作时间了。
Actually, Mrs. Harris, I'm afraid I'm going to have to reduce your hours.

202
00:20:19,554 --> 00:20:24,692
减少?请n不。夫人,请…现在我们都得节约，不是吗?
Reduce? N-No, please. Milady, please... Well, we all have to economize these days, don't we?

203
00:20:24,726 --> 00:20:25,827
对不起。

我知道你在那里，女人，在黑暗和寒冷中。
I know you're there, woman, in the dark and cold.

205
00:21:20,114 --> 00:21:22,850
我没事，小维。

206
00:21:24,585 --> 00:21:27,588
阿奇把我们送进了白城。

不，我还得补呢。

208

——Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah。- n不。不,不,六世。
- Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah. - N-No. No, no, Vi.

209

给我们找点乐子。

211
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:00,688

212
00:22:00,721 --> 00:22:02,056
这是一个信号。
It's a sign.

213

是的,我有!

216
00:22:07,128 --> 00:22:10,097
——嗯…excu……借口……-嗨。
- Um... excu... excuse... - Hey.

217
00:22:10,131 --> 00:22:12,834
——对不起。-艾达，你想赌一把吗?
- Excuse me. - Ada, you fancy a flutter?

218
00:22:12,867 --> 00:22:15,335
-是的。-要什么?
- Yeah. - What'll it be?

219
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:19,874
6号赌100英镑。

220
00:22:21,843 --> 00:22:23,644
赢。
To win.

221
00:22:23,678 --> 00:22:24,846
一吨?

222
00:22:24,879 --> 00:22:27,114
看在迈克的份上，艾达，不，收起来。
For the love of Mike, Ada, no, put it away.

223
00:22:27,148 --> 00:22:29,550
没有。6号。

224
00:22:29,584 --> 00:22:31,886
-请给我高级时装。-这只狗就像一袋骨头。
- Haute Couture, please. - The dog's a bag of bones.

225
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,988
屁股上有火箭它是赢不了的。
It couldn't win with a rocket up its arse.

226
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:35,455
你告诉她，阿奇。

227
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:36,991
她失去理智了。
She's lost her marbles.

228
00:22:37,024 --> 00:22:38,759
不，这是高级时装。
No, it's Haute Couture.

229
00:22:38,793 --> 00:22:40,628
这是一个信号。怎么会是别的呢?
It's a sign. How could it be anything else?

230
00:22:40,661 --> 00:22:42,864
艾达，我干这行很久了，好吗?
Ada, girl, I've been doing this a long time, all right?

231
00:22:42,897 --> 00:22:44,165
标志不能赢得比赛。
Signs don't win races.

232
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:46,868
直到今晚，他们才知道。
Not till tonight, they didn't.

233
00:22:49,704 --> 00:22:51,138
我的钱很好。

我们开始吧。这很好。

哦。祝我好运吧。

哦，看，她领先了!

245
00:24:06,747 --> 00:24:11,085
《聪明的伯爵》《蓝色条纹》《暴风雨湾》
It's Clever Count, Blue Streak, and Stormy Bay.

246
00:24:11,118 --> 00:24:16,123
你看…高级定制刚刚醒来，想起了她来这里的目的。
And would you look at that... Haute Couture has just woken up and remembered what she's here for.

247
00:24:29,971 --> 00:24:34,108
嗯…向你致敬，姑娘。
Well... Hats off to you, girl.

248
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:36,010
你去争取了。
You went for it.

249
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:38,980
我去找圣约翰救护车。
I'll go find a St John's Ambulance.

250
00:24:39,013 --> 00:24:40,915
他们可能喝了很多白兰地。
They might have a tot of brandy.

251
00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:43,584
给我。
For me.

252
00:24:43,617 --> 00:24:46,454
你是对的，维…那么多钱。
You were right, Vi... All that money.

253
00:24:47,588 --> 00:24:49,824
我的埃迪会为我感到羞耻。
My Eddie'd be ashamed of me.

254
00:24:51,025 --> 00:24:53,027
我马上回来，好吗?
I'll be right back, huh?

255
00:24:57,631 --> 00:25:00,935
做梦也没什么，艾达，对吧?
Nothing wrong with dreaming, Ada, hmm?

256
00:25:00,968 --> 00:25:05,506
当我来到伦敦，街道上铺满了我的梦想。
When I came to London, the streets were paved with my dreams.

257
00:25:10,778 --> 00:25:13,247
这就是你。
That's what you are.

258
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,583
你是一个梦想家。
You're a dreamer.

259
00:25:15,616 --> 00:25:17,785
就像你脸上的鼻子一样明显。
Plain as the nose on your face.

260
00:25:51,886 --> 00:25:55,623
算了吧，小维，我没事。
Give over, Vi. I'm all right.

261
00:25:55,656 --> 00:25:57,258
哈里斯太太吗?
Mrs. Harris?

262
00:25:57,291 --> 00:25:59,360
爱德华·哈里斯夫人?
Mrs. Edward Harris?

263
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:01,629
是关于你丈夫的。
It's about your husband.

264
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:05,633
请坐下。
Sit down, please.

265
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,838
哈里斯中士直到4月19日才被宣布在行动中失踪。
Sergeant Harris wasn't declared missing in action until April the 19th.

266
00:26:10,871 --> 00:26:13,074
是啊，我就是那时收到电报的。
Uh, yeah, that's when I got the telegram.

267
00:26:13,107 --> 00:26:15,209
那天是他生日的第二天。
It's a day after his birthday.

268
00:26:15,242 --> 00:26:17,344
啊,是的。
Ah, yes.

269
00:26:17,378 --> 00:26:30,991
我们现在知道，波罗·利马326号航班坠毁于1944年3月2日，也就是说哈里斯中士死后被支付了近七周的工资。
Well, um, as we now know, Flight Polo Lima 326 crashed on March the 2nd, 1944, meaning that Sergeant Harris was paid for almost seven weeks after his death.

270
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:35,329
一天六先令。
At, um, six shillings a day.

271
00:26:35,362 --> 00:26:38,099
这就是你来告诉我的吗?
Is that what you come to tell me?

272
00:26:38,132 --> 00:26:40,601
过了这么久。
After all this time.

273
00:26:41,268 --> 00:26:42,937
我的埃迪欠你工资吗?
That my Eddie owes you back pay?

274
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,972
他这辈子一分钱都没欠过。
When he never owed a penny in his life.

275
00:26:45,005 --> 00:26:47,408
当他为国王和国家牺牲自己的生命。
When he give up his life for king and country.

276
00:26:47,441 --> 00:26:48,976
你胆子真大。
You got a nerve.

277
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:52,146
来我家，喝我的茶，抹黑他的名声。
Coming into my home, drinking my tea, blackening his name.

278
00:26:52,179 --> 00:26:54,381
——嗯…-你想要多少?
- Um... - How much do you want?

279
00:26:54,415 --> 00:26:56,050
多少钱?然后你就可以走了。
How much? And then you can leave.

280
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:57,828
我觉得你理解错了。
I-I think you've got the wrong end of the stick.

281
00:26:57,852 --> 00:27:04,692
哦,我吗?我马上就告诉你，你可以把棍子插哪儿-如果你不小心的话。-天啊，不。嗯,我,嗯…我是来给你钱的，哈里斯太太，
Oh, have I? Well, I'll tell you where you can shove your stick in a minute, - if you don't watch out. - Oh, golly, no. Um, I, uh... I'm here to give you money, Mrs. Harris,

282
00:27:04,725 --> 00:27:08,929
-不是要从你那里拿走-我受够了…你想说什么?
- not-not to take it from you. - I've had enough of... What'd you say?

283
00:27:08,963 --> 00:27:10,998
好的，没问题
Y-Yes. Righto.

284
00:27:11,031 --> 00:27:16,237
你应该从1944年就开始领取战争寡妇抚恤金了。
Uh, you should have been receiving a-a war widow's pension since 1944.

285
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:20,107
算上那点小小的折扣，这是一笔不小的数目。
It comes to quite a tidy sum, uh, with that small deduction.

286
00:27:20,975 --> 00:27:23,144
只要你没再婚就行。
So long as you haven't remarried.

287
00:27:23,177 --> 00:27:24,879
算了吧
Oh, give over.

288
00:27:24,912 --> 00:27:28,249
他随时都有可能回来，我看起来就像个查理。
He might have come back any minute, I'd have looked a right Charlie.

289
00:27:28,282 --> 00:27:32,686
嗯…嗯…
Uh... well...

290
00:27:34,722 --> 00:27:37,658
我想你最好坐下。
I suppose you'd better sit down.

291
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:40,261
还是喝杯茶吧。
Have that cup of tea after all.

292
00:27:40,294 --> 00:27:42,296
嗯,没有牛奶。
Um, no milk.

293
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:45,432
她这辈子从没做过什么错事，先生。
She's never done a thing wrong her whole life, sir.

294
00:27:45,466 --> 00:27:50,037
她因为一件衣服有点发疯，但现在没事了。
She went a bit crazy on account of some dress, but she's fine now.

295
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,206
没什么好担心的。
Nothing to worry about.

296
00:27:57,344 --> 00:27:59,180
——哦,你好。-哈里斯太太?
- Oh, hello. - Mrs. Harris?

297
00:27:59,213 --> 00:28:01,315
你是来告诉我我拿到王冠了吗?
You come to tell me I got the crown jewels?

298
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:02,850
她还是神志不清。
She's still not right in the head.

299
00:28:02,883 --> 00:28:09,356
几乎。你交上来的那个钻石夹子…老板想奖励你做一个诚实的公民。
Almost. That diamond clip you handed in... The owner wants to give you a reward for being an honest citizen.

300
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:12,726
噢!她太诚实了，先生。
Oh! She is, sir, honest to a fault.

301
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,328
进来喝杯茶吧。
Come in and have a cup of tea.

302
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:15,930
请不要介意。谢谢你！
Don't mind if I do. Thank you.

303
00:28:15,963 --> 00:28:17,474
来吧，小维，我们可以来个聚会。
Oh, come on, Vi. We can have a knees-up.

304
00:28:17,498 --> 00:28:18,999
喂，等等我。
Oi, wait for me.

305
00:28:19,033 --> 00:28:21,402
还有，你最好把香槟开了。
And, uh, you might want to break out the bubbly.

306
00:28:21,435 --> 00:28:23,103
今天又走运了吗，阿奇?
You having another lucky day, Archie?

307
00:28:23,137 --> 00:28:25,239
事实上，我是，你也是。
As a matter of fact, I am, and so are you.

308
00:28:25,272 --> 00:28:26,974
消息传的很快。
News travels fast.

309
00:28:27,007 --> 00:28:31,478
所以，你在两条腿的狗身上下的赌注…哦,y-yeah,不要…别担心。
So, that bet you put on that two-legged dog... Oh, y-yeah, don't... don't worry about that.

310
00:28:31,513 --> 00:28:32,980
我恢复理智了。
I've come to me senses.

311
00:28:33,013 --> 00:28:38,018
没有，老板在那里，所以我不得不拿钱，但我设法保留了10英镑。
No, the boss was there, so I had to take the money, but I managed to hold back a tenner.

312
00:28:38,052 --> 00:28:39,987
你不该那么做的，阿奇。
You shouldn't have done that, Archie.

313
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,488
你可能会惹上麻烦。
You could have got into trouble.

314
00:28:41,523 --> 00:28:43,290
一切都很顺利，哈里斯太太?
All tickety-boo, Mrs. Harris?

315
00:28:44,491 --> 00:28:46,528
哦，对不起，我不知道你有客人。
Oh, sorry, I didn't realize you had company.

316
00:28:46,561 --> 00:28:48,963
你好。这是怎么回事?
Hello. What's going on here?

317
00:28:48,996 --> 00:28:50,364
——哦。-看在迈克的份上。
- Oh. - For the love of Mike.

318
00:28:50,397 --> 00:28:52,933
-待会见-不，阿奇，阿奇
- Uh, I'll see you later. - Uh, no, Archie, Archie.

319
00:28:52,967 --> 00:28:54,502
能让我单独待会儿吗?
Uh, can you just give me a moment?

320
00:28:54,536 --> 00:28:56,370
这是私事。
It-it's personal.

321
00:28:56,403 --> 00:28:58,739
-是水壶在叫吗?——是的。
- That the kettle calling? - Ah, righto.

322
00:29:00,508 --> 00:29:02,343
怎么了? 出什么事了吗?
What's going on? Something up?

323
00:29:02,376 --> 00:29:03,811
说来话长。
It's a long story.

324
00:29:03,844 --> 00:29:04,912
你刚才说什么?
What were you saying?

325
00:29:04,945 --> 00:29:08,983
所以，我拿了你的钱，把赌注压在了最后一场有把握的比赛上。
So, I took your money and put it on a sure thing in the last race.

326
00:29:09,016 --> 00:29:14,755
,嗯…把你的木桩拿回来，再加一点。
And, um... your stake back and a wee bit more.

327
00:29:15,956 --> 00:29:18,125
不，阿奇，我不能。
Oh, n-no, Archie, I couldn't.

328
00:29:18,158 --> 00:29:20,928
——我……-这是你的钱。拿着。
- I... - It's your money. Take it.

329
00:29:20,961 --> 00:29:22,396
我不能留着它，女人。
I can't keep it, woman.

330
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:25,032
PC Plod 在那里会有我的执照。来吧。
PC Plod in there would have my license. Come on.

331
00:29:28,302 --> 00:29:31,038
答应我在军团跳支舞。
Just promise me a dance at the Legion.

332
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:36,410
谢谢你,阿奇。
Thanks, Archie.

333
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:38,145
感谢。
Much obliged.

334
00:29:43,284 --> 00:29:44,385
啊呀。
Blimey.

335
00:30:03,237 --> 00:30:04,838
我们在飞吗?
Are we flying?

336
00:30:06,106 --> 00:30:08,576
女士们先生们，我们非常抱歉。
We're terribly sorry, ladies and gentlemen.

337
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,612
好像有一个引擎出了故障。
There seems to be a fault with one engine.

338
00:30:10,645 --> 00:30:14,315
在我们试图解决这个问题时，会有一点延迟。
There will be a slight delay while we try and fix the problem.

339
00:30:14,348 --> 00:30:16,150
延迟?
Delay?

340
00:30:16,183 --> 00:30:18,018
多久?
How long?

341
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:21,822
我得在一天之内来回。
I've got to be there and back in a day.

342
00:30:35,102 --> 00:30:37,371
哦,上帝。
Oh, God.

343
00:30:43,177 --> 00:30:44,378
巴黎。
Paris.

344
00:31:10,037 --> 00:31:12,406
好了，巴黎，我来了。
Righto, Paris, here I come.

345
00:31:16,644 --> 00:31:19,079
这是一条很长的路。
It's a fair old walk.

346
00:31:47,709 --> 00:31:51,513
哦。嗯…你好。
Oh. Um... bonjour.

347
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:53,036
英国人?
English?

348
00:31:53,046 --> 00:31:54,582
请求你的原谅吗?
Beg your pardon?

349
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:57,206
一个英国女人。
An Englishwoman.

00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,320
嘿。

351

谢谢你！是的。

00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:10,297
我是来买裙子的。
Um, I'm here to buy a dress.

353
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:11,432
迪奥的。
From Dior.

354
00:32:11,465 --> 00:32:13,033
迪奥?

355
00:32:13,066 --> 00:32:15,402
啊,是的。我也是。
Ah, oui. Me also.

356
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:21,576
离迪奥远吗?
Is it far... Dior?

357
00:32:21,609 --> 00:32:25,045
哦……20分钟。
Oh... 20 minutes.

358
00:32:25,078 --> 00:32:27,981
但你喝完酒，两小时后。
Uh, but after you take wine, two hours.

359
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,187
我陪你去。

360
00:32:34,221 --> 00:32:37,024
明天早上,是吗?
Tomorrow morning, eh?

361
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:40,292
你饿了吗?
Are you hungry?

362
00:32:40,394 --> 00:32:41,428
哦，不，不，谢谢。
Oh, no, no, thanks.

363

不,我不能

364
00:32:47,769 --> 00:32:50,304
好吧，接着说。
All right, go on, then.

365
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:57,645
哦,天哪。
Oh, blimey.

366
00:33:14,194 --> 00:33:16,764
街上为什么有这么多垃圾?
Why is all this rubbish on the streets?

367
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:21,958
大老板作弊……-那个工人，是吗?-是的,是的。
The big boss cheats... - The worker, yes? - Yeah, yeah.

368
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:24,169
嗯,没有。这是结束了。
Well, no. It's over.

369
00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:25,962
工人说:“不要了。”
The worker say, "No more."

370
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:27,756
他们已经受够了。
They've had enough.

371
00:33:27,809 --> 00:33:29,443
收垃圾的人罢工了?
The binmen are on strike?

372
00:33:29,476 --> 00:33:31,278
啊,是的。
Ah, yes.

373
00:33:31,311 --> 00:33:36,250
现在整个巴黎，呃，闻起来…嗯,喜欢我。
Now all Paris, uh, smells, uh... uh, like me.

374
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:40,018
我们到了，我们到了。
Here we are, we've arrived.

375
00:33:40,144 --> 00:33:42,062
伟大的迪奥品牌。

376
00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:43,290

你是一个高贵的女人。

379
00:33:49,096 --> 00:33:52,767
记住，在法国，工人就是国王。
And remember, in France, the worker is king.

380
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:08,446
尽你所能拖住他们。她不会太久的，我肯定。
Hold them back as best you can. She won't be long, I'm sure.

381
00:34:11,175 --> 00:34:12,175
对不起,夫人。
Excuse me, Madame.

382
00:34:12,319 --> 00:34:14,154
哦,小姐!
Oh, miss!

00:34:15,155 --> 00:34:16,624
你还好吗，亲爱的?笨拙的女孩!

384
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:19,258
André，这是怎么回事?我可能会受伤的!
André, what is going on? I could have been hurt!

385
00:34:19,259 --> 00:34:20,728

388
00:34:23,865 --> 00:34:25,567
哦。

00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,100
小姐?
Miss?

390
00:34:27,735 --> 00:34:29,469
小姐!
Miss!

391
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,240
-你还好吗?-别碰我!
- Are you all right? - Don't touch me!

392
00:34:39,246 --> 00:34:41,381
没有,小姐。
No, miss.

393
00:34:41,415 --> 00:34:43,083
奥奥!小姐!
Ooh-ooh! Miss!

394
00:34:43,685 --> 00:34:44,686
小姐?
Miss?

395
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,688
给你。
Here you go.

396
00:34:46,721 --> 00:34:48,188
你又一次救了我，夫人。
Once again, you save me, madame.

397
00:34:48,221 --> 00:34:49,891
——哦。——我很抱歉。我很晚。

——哦。——谢谢。
- Oh. - Thank you.

399
00:34:51,626 --> 00:34:53,861
没关系。只要你没受伤就行。
It's all right. As long as you're in one piece.

400
00:34:55,563 --> 00:34:57,097
哦。
Ooh.

401
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:00,349

402
00:35:08,643 --> 00:35:10,344
哦,嗯…

403
00:35:29,797 --> 00:35:32,232
哦。对不起,亲爱的。
Oh. Excuse me, dear.

404
00:35:32,265 --> 00:35:35,302
我在哪里可以找到这些衣服?
Where would I find the frocks?

541
00:46:30,991 --> 00:46:32,527
直到我看到《诱惑》。
Not till I saw Temptation.

542
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,428
选得好，夫人。
An excellent choice, madame.

543
00:46:34,461 --> 00:46:36,297
是的。多少钱?
Yeah. How much is it?

544
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:39,601
Vénus是60万法郎。
Vénus is 600,000 francs.

545
00:46:39,634 --> 00:46:42,036
430磅。
430 pounds.

546
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:45,272
包起来。我还要赶飞机。
Wrap it up. I got a plane to catch.

547
00:46:45,306 --> 00:46:47,041
我已经晚了一天了。
I'm a day late as it is.

548
00:46:47,074 --> 00:46:48,909
哦，你不能要这件礼服。
Oh, you cannot have this gown.

549
00:46:48,942 --> 00:46:51,546
别告诉我有人想要独占一切。
Oh, don't tell me someone wants that exclusive and all.

550
00:46:51,579 --> 00:46:55,983
哈里斯夫人，每件衣服都是为客户量身定做的。
Mais Madame Harris, every dress is made and fitted individually for the client.

551
00:46:56,016 --> 00:46:58,352
是的，这是高级时装。
Yes, this is haute couture.

552
00:46:58,385 --> 00:47:04,325
当然，我们将复制您看到的Vénus，但问题是……给我做一个?
We will, of course, reproduce Vénus exactly as you saw it, but the thing is... Make me one?

553
00:47:04,358 --> 00:47:05,560
那要花多长时间?
How long's that gonna take?

554
00:47:05,593 --> 00:47:07,194
好吧，至少两周。
Well, at least two weeks.

555
00:47:07,227 --> 00:47:09,129
哦。至少。
Ooh. At least.

556
00:47:09,163 --> 00:47:11,031
有必要装几件。
Several fittings are necessary.

557
00:47:11,065 --> 00:47:12,600
什么，离开我的人两周吗?
What, leave my people for a fortnight?

558
00:47:12,634 --> 00:47:14,944
他们会找别人，然后我就流落街头了。
They'd find someone else, and then I'd be out on the streets.

559
00:47:14,968 --> 00:47:16,437
那就去机场吧。
Vite, vite, to the airport, then.

560
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:18,939
如果你错过了航班，我不会原谅自己的。
I would not forgive myself if you missed your flight.

561
00:47:18,972 --> 00:47:21,108
-什么，不穿我的裙子?——Excusez-moi。
- What, without my dress? - Excusez-moi.

562
00:47:22,677 --> 00:47:25,045
也许你可以给你的朋友打电话?
Perhaps there is a friend you can call?

563
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:27,582
一个能帮你打扫卫生的人。
Someone who can assist you with your cleaning.

564
00:47:27,615 --> 00:47:30,528
维有，但我已经考验过她的耐心了。
Well, uh, there's Vi, but I've tried her patience enough as it is.

565
00:47:30,552 --> 00:47:31,985
总之，她不在电话上。
Anyway, she's not on the phone.

566
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:33,887
我们可以给她发个电报。
Uh, we might send her a telegram.

567
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:36,688
是的。是的,没错。
Yes. Yes, exactly.

568
00:47:37,257 --> 00:47:43,197
哈里斯太太，也许可以鼓励裁缝师和裁缝加快工作速度。
Uh, Mrs. Harris, uh, it might be possible to encourage the cutter and seamstress to work a little faster.

569
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:46,400
维夫人能给你一周时间吗?
And Madame Vi could fill you in for one week, perhaps?

570
00:47:47,535 --> 00:47:51,506
嗯…你真好，但我不能。
Well... you're kind, but I can't.

571
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:54,108
总之，我没地方住。
Anyway, I got nowhere to stay.

572
00:47:54,942 --> 00:47:56,877
我只好不去了。
I'll have to give it a miss.

573
00:47:59,279 --> 00:48:01,115
我妹妹不在。
My sister is away.

574
00:48:01,148 --> 00:48:07,888
如果你……可以接受，你可以住在我那，我姐姐的房间。
If you... would accept, um, you could stay at my place, uh, in my sister's room.

575
00:48:09,022 --> 00:48:12,059
你是个真正的天使，不是吗?
You're a proper angel, aren't you?

576
00:48:12,727 --> 00:48:14,294
这是我的荣幸。
It'll be my pleasure.

577
00:48:14,328 --> 00:48:15,639
我们可以马上给你量尺寸。
Um, we can have your measurements taken at once.

578
00:48:15,663 --> 00:48:17,164
怎么了，科尔伯特夫人?
N'est-ce pas, Madame Colbert?

579
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:18,386
工作室无事可做。
The atelier has nothing to do.

580
00:48:18,438 --> 00:48:19,832
但为了这一个订单?
But to devote itself to this one order?

581
00:48:19,856 --> 00:48:25,653
现金交易，夫人。考虑到我们的情况下……很好，福维尔先生。看来现在是你说了算了。
A cash sale, Madame. Given our circumstances... Very well, Monsieur Fauvel. It seems you are in charge now.

582
00:48:26,073 --> 00:48:27,441
哈里斯夫人。来了。
Come, Madame Harris. Come.

583
00:48:27,474 --> 00:48:28,942
——哦。-我们必须快点。
- Oh. - We must be quick.

584
00:48:28,976 --> 00:48:30,244
如果你们褶。
S'il vous plaît.

585
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:33,161
你去。不要只是站在那里。
Off you go. Don't just stand there.

586
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:37,951
哦。
Oh.

587
00:48:37,985 --> 00:48:39,554
-布拉沃,夫人。-布拉沃。

588
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:48,429
——请夫人。——哦。
- Please, madame. - Oh.

589
00:48:48,462 --> 00:48:51,965
当你买了一件Woolworths羽绒服，就不会有这么多的欢呼了。
You don't get all this hoo-ha when you buy a frock down Woolworths.

590
00:48:51,999 --> 00:48:55,603
我可以告诉你，这种事在这里也不是每天都有。
Well, I can tell you such things do not happen every day here, either.

591
00:48:55,637 --> 00:48:59,019
啊，那位必须穿裙子的女士……快,快,快。
Ah, the lady who must have her dress... Quick, quick, quick.

592
00:49:00,642 --> 00:49:02,276
你的外套,请。

593
00:49:02,309 --> 00:49:04,011

598
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:24,962
八十二年。
Eighty-two.

599
00:49:28,216 --> 00:49:29,550
六十二年。
Sixty-two.

600
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:32,473
这位夫人有着模特的身材比例。
Madame has the proportions of a model.

601
00:49:33,741 --> 00:49:35,543
更像是铁路模型。
Model railway, more like.

602
00:49:37,044 --> 00:49:38,680
弯曲的部分之一
One of the curvy bits.

603
00:49:41,415 --> 00:49:42,717
噢,谢谢你。
Oh, thank you.

604
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:44,752
非常感谢。
Thank you very much.

605
00:49:50,525 --> 00:49:52,092
夫人呢?
Madame?

606
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:53,628
哦。
Oh.

607
00:49:53,661 --> 00:49:54,762
我可以载你一程吗?
May I give you a lift?

608
00:49:54,796 --> 00:49:58,365
哦，好吧，如果不麻烦的话。
Oh, well, if it's no bother.

609
00:49:58,398 --> 00:49:59,066
没有。
No.

610
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:02,402
我要去福维尔先生家。
Uh, I'm going to Mr. Fauvel's.

611
00:50:04,171 --> 00:50:05,507
18,是的。这很简单。
The 18th, yes. That's easy.

612
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:08,208
-哦，原谅我这么乱。——哦。
- Oh, forgive the mess. - Oh.

613
00:50:09,209 --> 00:50:11,546
他是你的朋友吗，福维尔先生?
Is he a friend of yours, Mr. Fauvel?

614
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:15,382
没有。不，我只知道福维尔先生是给我签支票的人。
No. No, I-I know Mr. Fauvel only as the hand that signs my check.

615
00:50:15,415 --> 00:50:17,017
哦。
Oh.

616
00:50:17,652 --> 00:50:19,219
哦。
Oh.

617
00:50:19,253 --> 00:50:22,155
L’être et le néant。
L'être et le néant.

618
00:50:22,189 --> 00:50:24,424
就是《存在与不存在》
It's, uh, "Being and Not Being."

619
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:28,530
我自己也喜欢蜷缩在一个多汁的谜团里。
I like to curl up with a juicy mystery meself.

620
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,610
哦，看，那是埃菲尔铁塔。
Oh, look, there's the Eiffel Tower.

621
00:50:51,184 --> 00:50:53,453
哦,太可爱了。
Oh, that's lovely.

622
00:51:01,596 --> 00:51:03,565
哦。
Oh.

623
00:51:03,598 --> 00:51:05,499
这是歌剧。
That's the opera.

624
00:51:18,913 --> 00:51:20,582
我帮您拿行李好吗?
May I help you with your luggage?

625
00:51:20,615 --> 00:51:23,283
里面什么都没有。
Nothing in it yet.

626
00:51:23,317 --> 00:51:26,186
哦。这是,不是吗?
Oh. That's something, innit?

627
00:51:36,631 --> 00:51:38,231
哦。
Ooh.

628
00:51:42,336 --> 00:51:45,172
我觉得他妹妹不知道拖把在哪里。
I don't think his sister knows where the mop is.

629
00:51:46,641 --> 00:51:49,343
一定有个簸箕和刷子。
There must be a dustpan and brush somewhere.

630
00:51:54,281 --> 00:51:57,685
嗯…哦。
Uh... Oh.

631
00:52:01,789 --> 00:52:03,791
你不用这么做的，亲爱的。
Oh, you don't have to do that, love.

632
00:52:03,825 --> 00:52:06,226
你一定有更重要的事情要做。
You must have better things to do.

633
00:52:06,259 --> 00:52:08,195
不,不是真的。
No, not really.

634
00:52:08,228 --> 00:52:12,700
défilé之后，总有一种空虚的感觉。
After the défilé, there's always a certain feeling of emptiness.

635
00:52:12,734 --> 00:52:13,901
哦。
Oh.

636
00:52:13,935 --> 00:52:15,670
好吧,鸭子。
All right, ducks.

637
00:52:16,671 --> 00:52:19,439

现在我们开始工作了。

639
00:52:28,549 --> 00:52:30,317
哦。
Oh.

640
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:32,351
发生了什么事?
What's happened?

641
00:52:32,352 --> 00:52:34,589
-哈里斯太太?——你好,爱。
- Mrs. Harris? - Hello, love.

642
00:52:36,289 --> 00:52:37,759
小姐。
Mademoiselle.

643
00:52:37,792 --> 00:52:39,259
她是个好工人。
She's a good worker.

644
00:52:39,292 --> 00:52:42,068
我总能给你找份工作，姑娘，如果你当模特不合适的话。
I can always find you a job, my girl, if the modeling don't work out.

645
00:52:43,703 --> 00:52:48,301
我很尴尬，你看到了……不,不。
I am embarrassed beyond words that you have seen the state of... No, no.

646
00:52:48,541 --> 00:52:52,211

I haven't had time to... No, please, it was nothing.

噢!噢!请允许我……——我很抱歉。-不，对不起。
Oh! Oh! Allow me... - I'm sorry. - No, I'm sorry.

648
00:52:57,049 --> 00:52:58,759
不，是我，我不应该……
No, it's me, I shouldn't have...

649
00:53:02,449 --> 00:53:03,827
M-Mrs。哈里斯做了晚饭。
M-Mrs. Harris has cooked the dinner.

650
00:53:03,851 --> 00:53:08,388
你们看起来需要一顿丰盛的大餐，你们俩。
You look like you could do with a good square meal, the pair of you.

651
00:53:08,422 --> 00:53:10,424
娜塔莎小姐还有别的事要做。
Well, Mademoiselle Natasha has other engagements.

652
00:53:10,457 --> 00:53:13,293
我相信迪奥的形象总是出现在派对或首映礼上。
I'm sure the face of Dior is always at a party or premiere.

653
00:53:13,326 --> 00:53:15,663
稍后有一个soirée。
There's a soirée later.

654
00:53:16,731 --> 00:53:19,199

00:53:26,373 --> 00:53:28,341
别让它变冷了。
Don't let it get cold.

657
00:53:32,847 --> 00:53:35,248
祝你有个好胃口。祝你有个好胃口。
- Bon appétit. - Bon appétit.

658
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:38,452
埃迪最喜欢的。
My Eddie's favorite.

659
00:53:38,485 --> 00:53:40,822
要是有肉汁就更好了。
Be even better if we had a bit of gravy.

660
00:53:41,789 --> 00:53:43,591
嗯，这道菜叫什么名字?
Um, and what's the dish named?

661
00:53:43,624 --> 00:53:46,359
面拖烤肉。
Toad-in-the-hole.

662
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:48,225
青蛙的……?
Frog in the...?

663
00:53:48,768 --> 00:53:50,227
在沟里。
In the ditch.

664
00:53:51,398 --> 00:53:54,736
书真多啊，福维尔先生。
What a lot of books, Mr. Fauvel.

665
00:53:54,769 --> 00:53:56,336
哦。
Oh.

666
00:53:56,369 --> 00:53:58,740
娜塔莎有个谜一样的谋杀案。
Natasha's got a corker, a murder-mystery.

667
00:53:58,773 --> 00:54:00,273
鸭子,你不?
Don't you, ducks?

668
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:02,073
存在与虚无。
Being and Nothingness.

669
00:54:02,782 --> 00:54:03,782
你在读萨特?
You are reading Sartre?

670
00:54:03,878 --> 00:54:04,846
我们应该说英语。
We should speak English.

671
00:54:04,879 --> 00:54:05,880
哦,是的。当然。
Oh, yeah. Of course.

672
00:54:05,913 --> 00:54:11,552
我很想知道娜塔莎小姐在读一本法国哲学家让-保罗·萨特写的书。——哦。
Um, I-I'm interested to learn that Mademoiselle Natasha is reading a book - by the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. - Oh.

673
00:54:11,586 --> 00:54:13,788
作者让我们考虑一下服务员的情况。
The author asks us to consider the case of the waiter.

674
00:54:13,821 --> 00:54:17,658
服务员就是服务员吗，还是只是服务员的一种表达?
Is the waiter the waiter, or is it just an expression of what the waiter is?

675
00:54:17,692 --> 00:54:21,763
同样的，我是会计吗，还是你给我的印象?
Um, similarly, am I the accountant, or is that an outward impression?

676
00:54:21,796 --> 00:54:29,737
嗯，娜塔莎小姐是最美丽、最精致、最神圣的巴黎模特，还是……还是表象背后另有其人?
Um, is Mademoiselle Natasha only the most beautiful, the most exquisitely divine Parisian model, or... Or is there another person behind the facade?

677
00:54:30,671 --> 00:54:31,739
是的。
Yes.

678
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:37,888
哈里斯太太是清洁工吗，还是她的存在有其他意义?
Is Mrs. Harris the cleaner, or is there more to define her existence?

679
00:54:37,912 --> 00:54:39,412
完全一样。
Exactement.

680
00:54:39,446 --> 00:54:41,916
我是巴特西的清洁工。没有秘密。
I'm a cleaner from Battersea. No mystery there.

681
00:54:41,949 --> 00:54:45,385
不，你是一个梦想着拥有世界上最漂亮礼服的清洁工。
Uh, no, you're a cleaner who dreams of the most beautiful gown in the world.

682
00:54:45,418 --> 00:54:47,454
哦,梦,是吗?
Oh, dreams, eh?

683
00:54:48,623 --> 00:54:52,794
天知道薇收到那封漂亮的电报会说什么。
God knows what Vi is gonna say when she gets that blooming telegram.

684
00:55:04,806 --> 00:55:06,607
哈里斯太太吗?
Mrs. Harris?

685
00:55:06,641 --> 00:55:09,577
请随便拿我妹妹的衣服。
Uh, please help yourself to my sister's clothes.

686
00:55:10,711 --> 00:55:13,413
哦,谢谢你,爱。嗯，我还好。
Oh, thanks, love. Um, I'm all right.

687
00:55:14,381 --> 00:55:16,316
她会坚持的。
Uh, she would insist.

688
00:55:17,852 --> 00:55:19,120
晚安
Good night.

689
00:55:19,153 --> 00:55:20,721
晚安，亲爱的。
Night, love.

690
00:55:20,755 --> 00:55:22,590
做个好梦。
Sweet dreams.

691
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,175
噢!
Ooh!

692
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:16,376
站直,夫人。
Stand straight, madame.

693
00:56:17,578 --> 00:56:20,982
——哦!——不,但是……别动。你为什么要动?
- Oh! - Non, mais... Keep still. Why do you move?

694
00:56:21,015 --> 00:56:22,583
对不起。对不起。
Sorry. Sorry.

695
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,965
我想和你谈谈改动的事玛格丽特公主?玛格丽特公主要求的。
I need to speak to you about some of the alterations Princess Margaret? Requested by Princess Margaret.

696
00:56:27,989 --> 00:56:29,489
哦，我喜欢她。
Oh, I like her.

697
00:56:29,523 --> 00:56:30,934
你可以从她的眼睛里看到一丝调皮。
You can see a little bit of mischief in her eye.

698
00:56:30,958 --> 00:56:34,795
我们尊贵的客户要求我们极其谨慎。
Our distinguished clients demand our utmost discretion.

699
00:56:36,477 --> 00:56:38,062
走吧，Carré先生。
Let's go, Monsieur Carré.

700
00:56:38,065 --> 00:56:39,867
今天就到这里。
That's all for today.

701
00:56:41,535 --> 00:56:43,871
这一点就很重要了，不是吗?
Little bit of that one goes a long way, don't it?

702
00:56:43,905 --> 00:56:45,506
她吃什么?
What's eating her?

703
00:56:45,539 --> 00:56:47,909
客户越重要，就越难搞定。
Well, the more grand the client, the more difficult.

704
00:56:47,942 --> 00:56:53,514
他们的愿望必须始终得到满足，即使这意味着重新开始。
Their wishes must be accommodated always, even if it means starting afresh.

705
00:56:53,547 --> 00:56:55,616
-货到付款。——哦!
- And they do not pay until delivery. - Oh!

706
00:56:55,650 --> 00:56:56,684
如果。
If then.

707
00:56:56,717 --> 00:56:59,186
要找的薪水太多了。
There are so many salaries to find.

708
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:04,558
面料、编结、刺绣、纽扣都必须是最好的。
The fabric, braid, embroidery, buttons all must be the very best.

709
00:57:04,592 --> 00:57:06,193
每个人都有压力:
The pressure is on everyone:

710
00:57:06,227 --> 00:57:15,670
对福维尔先生和帐目，对科尔伯特夫人和女裁缝，甚至对迪奥先生本人，总是这样的压力。
on Mr. Fauvel and the accounts, on Madame Colbert and the seamstresses, even on Monsieur Dior himself, always such pressure.

711
00:57:15,703 --> 00:57:19,674
难怪福维尔先生看到我的小手提包会这么高兴。
Well, no wonder Mr. Fauvel was so pleased to see my little handbag.

712
00:57:19,707 --> 00:57:25,813
事实上，哈里斯夫人，我们都担心迪奥品牌不能再这样下去了。
Well, in truth, Madame Harris, all of us fear the House of Dior cannot keep going this way.

713
00:57:42,129 --> 00:57:43,597
是的,先生。
Oui, monsieur.

714
00:57:54,942 --> 00:57:56,610
你还好吗，亲爱的?
You all right, love?

715
00:57:58,245 --> 00:58:00,214
醒来吧,醒来吧。
Wakey, wakey.

716
00:58:00,247 --> 00:58:02,183
他们找你。
They're calling for you.

717
00:58:02,216 --> 00:58:03,884
哦。
Oh.

718
00:58:03,918 --> 00:58:05,987
嗯,我很抱歉。
Um, I'm sorry.

719
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:07,588
-我只是累了。——嗯。
- I'm just tired. - Mm-hmm.

720
00:58:07,621 --> 00:58:09,657
你可以去度个假。
You could do with a little holiday.

721
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:11,625
它已经给我带来了行善的力量。
It's doing me the power of good already.

722
00:58:11,659 --> 00:58:14,028
是的，那太好了。
Yes, that would be nice.

723
00:58:15,129 --> 00:58:18,733
一个人在海边，那里没有人……你在哪里?
By myself at the seaside, where nobody... Where are you?

724
00:58:18,766 --> 00:58:19,734
对不起。
I'm sorry.

725
00:58:19,767 --> 00:58:21,769
-我得走了。谢谢你！——哦。
- I must go. Thank you. - Oh.

726
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:24,251
对不起。
Sorry.

727
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:35,596
不，它不工作。
No, it doesn't work.

728
00:58:39,153 --> 00:58:40,921
谢谢你！
Thank you.

729
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:44,959
您穿得怎么样，夫人?
How was your fitting, madame?

730
00:58:44,992 --> 00:58:46,193
哦。
Oh.

731
00:58:46,227 --> 00:58:48,629
这不是我的老朋友罗斯巴德先生吗。
Well, if it isn't my old pal, Mr. Rosebud.

732
00:58:48,662 --> 00:58:51,665
我很遗憾我们没有正式介绍。
I regret we were not properly introduced.

733
00:58:51,699 --> 00:58:53,901
Hypolite de Chassagne侯爵。
Marquis Hypolite de Chassagne.

734
00:58:53,934 --> 00:58:55,169
哦。
Ooh.

735
00:58:55,202 --> 00:58:57,538
艾达·哈里斯，巴特西的寡妇。
Ada Harris, widow of Battersea.

736
00:58:58,172 --> 00:58:59,673
这个好人是谁?
Who's this fine fella?

737
00:58:59,707 --> 00:59:01,242
-这是奈斯奎克。——哦。
- This is Nesquik. - Oh.

738
00:59:01,275 --> 00:59:04,645
我相信迪奥先生能满足你的愿望?
So, I trust Monsieur Dior fulfills your heart's desire?

739
00:59:04,678 --> 00:59:06,747
哦，他们真是太好了。
Oh, they're being ever so kind.

740
00:59:07,681 --> 00:59:10,584
路易丝调研。我忘了名字了。
Louise Odier. I'd forgotten the name.

741
00:59:10,618 --> 00:59:13,554
哦，我得给你看点东西。
Oh, I must show you something.

742
00:59:14,321 --> 00:59:16,724
拜托，我不会耽误你太久的。
Please, I won't detain you long.

743
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:27,168
跟我说说，你在巴黎过得怎么样?
So, tell me, how are you enjoying your time in Paris?

744
00:59:31,739 --> 00:59:33,941
我妻子很喜欢Marché aux Fleurs。
My wife adored the Marché aux Fleurs.

745
00:59:35,242 --> 00:59:38,079
我们几乎到最后才回来。
We came here almost until the end.

746
00:59:38,112 --> 00:59:40,247
到现在已经七年了。
It's been seven years now.

747
00:59:40,281 --> 00:59:42,750
我们修补，但我们不会忘记。
We mend, but we don't forget.

748
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:51,859
当你向世界展示你的迪奥礼服时，它将是完美的。——哦。
When you display your Dior dress to the world, - it will be perfection. - Oh.

749
00:59:54,228 --> 00:59:56,163
我朋友维觉得我疯了。
My pal Vi thinks I'm barmy.

750
00:59:58,265 --> 01:00:00,034
“你要那件衣服干什么?”
"What do you want that dress for?

751
01:00:00,067 --> 01:00:02,236
你打算什么时候穿?”
When are you gonna wear it?"

752
01:00:02,269 --> 01:00:07,675
我不怀疑你想要这样一件高品质的礼服，即使只给你一个人看。
Oh, I do not question your desire for a gown of such quality, even if it is for your eyes alone.

753
01:00:07,708 --> 01:00:10,111
不，不，正相反，我理解。
No, no, on the contrary, I understand.

754
01:00:10,144 --> 01:00:18,886
你看，像这样的一朵玫瑰，或者像你这样的一件漂亮的长袍，他们……他们回忆起我们风华正茂的青春岁月。
You see, a rose like this one or a beautiful gown such as yours, they... they recall the days when we were in the full flower of our youth.

755
01:00:19,753 --> 01:00:22,189
别现在就把我排除在外。
Oi, don't write me off just yet.

756
01:00:24,058 --> 01:00:27,261
-哦，万分抱歉。-哦,不。
- Oh, a thousand apologies. - Oh, no.

757
01:00:27,294 --> 01:00:29,630
请允许我赔罪。
Please, allow me to make amends.

758
01:00:30,431 --> 01:00:34,101
今晚有安排吗?
Have you any arrangements for tonight?

759
01:00:43,244 --> 01:00:44,378
瞧。
Voilà.

760
01:00:44,411 --> 01:00:46,013
噢,谢谢你。
Oh, thank you.

761
01:00:58,159 --> 01:00:59,293
来点香槟?
Some champagne?

762
01:00:59,326 --> 01:01:00,427
哦，好的，请。
Uh, oh, yes, please.

763
01:01:00,461 --> 01:01:01,962
就一滴
Just a drop.

764
01:01:03,097 --> 01:01:04,331
谢谢你！
Thank you.

765
01:01:04,365 --> 01:01:06,233
现在，你一定要尝尝鱼子酱。
Now, you-you must try the caviar.

766
01:01:06,267 --> 01:01:07,768
哦。好吧
Oh. Right.

767
01:01:07,801 --> 01:01:09,904
——干杯。——干杯。
- Cheers. - Cheers.

768
01:01:15,409 --> 01:01:17,178
——不错,嗯?
- Nice, huh? - Mm.

769
01:01:17,211 --> 01:01:18,479
哦,哦,你好!
Uh, oh, hello!

770
01:01:20,347 --> 01:01:23,317
我觉得这身打扮骗不了任何人。你呢?
I don't think that getup's gonna fool anyone. Do you?

771
01:01:30,224 --> 01:01:31,959
可爱的女孩。
Lovely girls.

772
01:01:31,992 --> 01:01:33,494
嗯。很快，你就会看到有多可爱了。
Hmm. Soon, you'll see how lovely.

773
01:01:40,502 --> 01:01:43,237
噢!哦。稳定。
Ooh! Oh. Steady on.

774
01:01:50,844 --> 01:01:52,813
天啊，这些女孩都是自己挣钱养活自己的。
Blimey, they earn their keep, them girls.

775
01:01:52,846 --> 01:01:57,218
至少我打扫的时候，不用笑着脱衣服了。
Well, least when I'm cleaning, I don't have to smile and strip as well.

776
01:02:00,387 --> 01:02:02,089
晚安,哈里斯太太。
Bonsoir, Mrs. Harris.

777
01:02:02,122 --> 01:02:03,490
娜塔莎。你好,爱。
Natasha. Hello, love.

778
01:02:03,525 --> 01:02:04,959
你好。
Hello.

779
01:02:04,992 --> 01:02:06,894
晚上好,小姐。
Bonsoir, mademoiselle.

780
01:02:06,927 --> 01:02:08,829
-你想加入我们吗?-好的，谢谢。
- Would you like to join us? - Uh, yes, please.

781
01:02:08,862 --> 01:02:10,231
那你和谁一起来的?
Who are you here with, then?

782
01:02:10,264 --> 01:02:11,966
投资者。
Investors.

783
01:02:11,999 --> 01:02:13,968
我逃脱了，但只是一瞬间。
I escape but only for a moment.

784
01:02:14,001 --> 01:02:17,171
他们不会让你整天整夜都在做。
They don't half keep you at it, all day and all night as well.

785
01:02:17,204 --> 01:02:19,974
对于Maison Dior来说，这是我的责任。
For Maison Dior, this is my obligation.

786
01:02:20,007 --> 01:02:22,376
好吧，迪奥不仅仅是关于礼服。
Ah, well, Dior is not just about gowns.

787
01:02:22,409 --> 01:02:34,054
它还体现了巴黎的优雅、颓废和优雅的生活方式，还有……而你，娜塔莎小姐，你是迪奥王冠上的一颗宝石。
It's also about elegance and decadence and the savoir-vivre of Paris, and... and you, Mademoiselle Natasha, you are the jewel of this Dior crown.

788
01:02:34,088 --> 01:02:36,457
嗯，我更喜欢在家看书。
Well, I would prefer to be at home with a book.

789
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:38,125
你这么说真有趣。
It's funny you should say that.

790
01:02:38,158 --> 01:02:40,261
我把福维尔先生留在家里看书了。
I've left Mr. Fauvel at home reading a book.

791
01:02:40,294 --> 01:02:45,266
它被称为…“好管闲事”?就像这样。
It was called... "Nosy"? Something like that.

792
01:02:45,299 --> 01:02:47,935
- La nausee ?——不知道。
- La nausée? - Don't know.

793
01:02:48,969 --> 01:02:53,907
为什么他要容忍时尚公司，而不是萨特和智慧的世界?
Why does he tolerate the fashion house compared to his world of Sartre and the intellect?

794
01:02:54,576 --> 01:02:57,011
我想他有他的理由。
Well, I-I think he has his reasons.

795
01:03:04,885 --> 01:03:06,220
你喜欢这场演出吗?
Do you enjoy the show?

796
01:03:06,253 --> 01:03:11,892
是的,一个…最后那个，她…她和我蒂尔达阿姨长得一模一样。
Yeah, the one... the one at the end, she... she's a dead ringer for my Aunt Tilda.

797
01:03:11,925 --> 01:03:13,460
从后面。
From behind.

798
01:03:16,463 --> 01:03:19,033
这很好，但我该走了。
Well, this was lovely, but I should go.

799
01:03:19,066 --> 01:03:20,434
谢谢你！
Thank you.

800
01:03:20,467 --> 01:03:22,269
哦，等一下，亲爱的。
Oh, just-just a minute, love.

801
01:03:22,303 --> 01:03:23,571
你的刘海。
Your fringe.

802
01:03:23,605 --> 01:03:25,372
有一个小缺口。
There's a little gap.

803
01:03:25,406 --> 01:03:27,174
就是这样。
That's it.

804
01:03:28,008 --> 01:03:29,544
你已经征服了他。
You have made a conquest.

805
01:03:29,577 --> 01:03:31,312
哦，走开。
Oh, get away with you.

806
01:03:31,345 --> 01:03:34,448
你敢于追逐梦想，哈里斯太太。
You dare to follow your dreams, Mrs. Harris.

807
01:03:34,481 --> 01:03:36,216
-布拉沃。——哦。

出去!出去!Avallon出来!

822
01:05:32,203 --> 01:05:33,467
我真不敢相信。
I can't believe this.

823
01:05:33,889 --> 01:05:35,515
阿瓦隆，你这个肮脏的臭家伙!
Avallon, you dirty stinker!

824
01:05:35,641 --> 01:05:36,641
把他扔进垃圾桶!
Chuck him in the bin!

825
01:05:40,708 --> 01:05:42,342
对不起!
Sorry!

826
01:05:45,045 --> 01:05:48,248

828
01:05:51,619 --> 01:05:53,420
这是不可能的，完全不可能。
This is not possible, not at all.

829

不不不，求你了，我…我从不迟到。我…R-Really,我不是。我从不迟到。对不起。
No, no, no, please, I-I'm... I'm never late. I... R-Really, I'm not. I'm never late. Sorry.

830
01:05:58,292 --> 01:06:00,595
你要求我们"快，快，快"
You demand of us, "Vite, vite, vite,"

831
01:06:00,628 --> 01:06:02,597
但你没有尊重。
but you have no respect.

832
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:05,466
不，这是不可能的。
No, this cannot be done.

833
01:06:05,499 --> 01:06:07,434
不客气。
Not at all.

834
01:06:07,468 --> 01:06:09,336
现在我离开了。
Now I depart.

835
01:06:09,369 --> 01:06:11,205
这是完成了。

838
01:06:15,042 --> 01:06:17,377
Carré先生拒绝继续。
Monsieur Carré refuses to proceed.

839
01:06:17,411 --> 01:06:19,079
我该怎么办?

01:06:19,112 --> 01:06:23,217
没有。不，当然，我…不,我理解。
No. No, of course, I... No, I understand.

841

是的，我当然知道。我做的事。

842
01:06:27,154 --> 01:06:29,289
迪奥，它不只是一件礼服。
Dior, it's-it's not just a gown.

It's, um... It's all the elegance and-and the savvy and all that.

我想办法退还您的押金。
I will see what can be done to return your deposit.

846
01:06:39,601 --> 01:06:44,251
不,我不…所以,Carre先生……
No, I don't... So, Monsieur Carré...

847
01:06:47,407 --> 01:06:53,548
我…我不希望…我不要我的存款。
I-I... I don't want... I don't want me deposit.

848
01:06:56,283 --> 01:06:58,418
香槟查理，对吧?
Right Champagne Charlie, aren't I?

849
01:06:58,452 --> 01:07:01,154
我活该，过着奢华的生活。
Serves me right, living the high life.

850
01:07:02,289 --> 01:07:04,626
我尊重你们，你们所有人。
I do respect you, all of you.

851
01:07:06,393 --> 01:07:08,028
没关系,是吗?
Never mind, eh?

852
01:07:09,363 --> 01:07:10,798
谢谢你,爱。
Thanks, love.

853
01:07:10,832 --> 01:07:12,600
你真是太好了。
You've been ever so kind.

854
01:07:12,634 --> 01:07:17,605
哈里斯夫人，你走之前要不要去看看工作室?
Madame Harris, would you care to see the atelier before you leave?

855
01:07:17,639 --> 01:07:19,439
哦。
Ooh.

856
01:07:21,174 --> 01:07:23,210
你好,夫人。-你好。

857
01:07:23,243 --> 01:07:25,580
所以，这个房间是用来切的。
So, this room is for cutting.

858
01:07:30,585 --> 01:07:32,352
-你好。——早上。

859
01:07:47,902 --> 01:07:50,572

Broderie。
Broderie.

864
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:13,525
哈里斯夫人吗?
Mrs Harris?

865
01:09:13,608 --> 01:09:15,068
你还好吗?
Are you all right?

866
01:09:17,692 --> 01:09:19,560
这不是缝纫。
It's not sewing.

867
01:09:20,427 --> 01:09:21,929
它让月光。
It's making moonlight.

868
01:09:23,831 --> 01:09:25,733
我去天堂了吗?
Have I gone to heaven?

869
01:09:27,622 --> 01:09:30,166
哈里斯太太问她是不是去天堂了。
Mrs Harris asked if she's gone to heaven.

870
01:09:32,711 --> 01:09:34,170
女士们!

871
01:09:35,297 --> 01:09:36,423
快,快。回去工作!
Quick, quick. Back to work!

872
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:48,018
你觉得这种布料适合阿佛洛狄忒吗?
Do you think this fabric could work well for Aphrodite?

873
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:50,937
是的，我喜欢这个颜色。
Yes, I love the color.

874
01:09:51,062 --> 01:09:53,064
我可以带Carré先生去吗?——当然。
- May I show Monsieur Carré? - Certainly.

875
01:09:57,903 --> 01:09:59,946
Carré先生，这种面料更豪华。
Monsieur Carré, this fabric is even more luxurious.

876
01:10:00,113 --> 01:10:01,865
也许我们可以用它来…?
Perhaps we could use it for...?

877
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:15,253
我们找到了一些共同点，小麻雀和我。
We have found some common ground, the little sparrow and I.

878
01:10:18,423 --> 01:10:20,091
她是个能干的女裁缝。
She's a capable seamstress.

879
01:10:23,678 --> 01:10:26,139
按钮会出什么问题?
What could go wrong with buttons?

880
01:10:40,041 --> 01:10:46,446
自从le maître发布了他的第一个系列以来，我已经在迪奥的肩膀上日夜站了十年。
I have stood at Monsieur Dior's shoulder day and night for ten years, since le maître unveiled his first collection.

881
01:10:48,482 --> 01:10:52,486
世界上最时髦的女人来到蒙田大道。
The most fashionable women in the world come to the Avenue Montaigne.

882
01:10:52,520 --> 01:11:00,494
皇室成员和交际花，瘦的，胖的，年轻的，年老的，丑陋的，或者有什么说不上来的。
Royalty and courtesans, thin, fat, young, old, ugly, or with a certain je ne sais quoi.

883

嗯。
Hmm.

884
01:11:01,662 --> 01:11:04,732
但还有你，哈里斯太太。
But then there is you, Mrs. Harris.

885
01:11:04,766 --> 01:11:10,071
我当导演这么久，还从没遇到过像你这样的人。
All my time as directress, I have never encountered anyone like you.

886
01:11:10,104 --> 01:11:11,606
哦。
Oh.

887
01:11:11,639 --> 01:11:13,808
在我的生活中，你会遇到各种各样的人。
In my walk of life, you meet all sorts.

888
01:11:13,841 --> 01:11:20,815
作为一个好老板，我必须让我的员工开心，他们的愿望就是完成你的衣服。
As a good boss, I must keep my workers happy, and their wish is to complete your dress.

889
01:11:20,848 --> 01:11:22,984
哦。感谢。
Oh. Much obliged.

890
01:11:23,017 --> 01:11:27,054
所以你能礼貌地回答我的问题吗?
So you will do me the courtesy of answering my questions, no?

891
01:11:27,088 --> 01:11:28,790
是的。
Yeah.

892
01:11:29,924 --> 01:11:31,759
哦。干杯。干杯!

893
01:11:36,429 --> 01:11:39,667
你为什么来这里，哈里斯太太?
Why do you come here, Mrs. Harris?

894
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:44,672
Évidemment，富人和有头衔的人必须被看到，崇拜，模仿。
Évidemment, the rich and titled must be seen, admired, copied.

895
01:11:45,673 --> 01:11:50,545
但是这条你非常渴望的Dior裙子，你会在哪里穿呢?
But this Dior dress that you desire so much, where will you wear it?

896
01:11:50,578 --> 01:11:54,615
是在维也纳歌剧舞会还是夏洛特女王的舞会?
At the Vienna Opera Ball or Queen Charlotte's?

897
01:11:54,649 --> 01:11:58,886
你会用它来擦地板，还是会把它关在你的小衣柜里?
Will you wear it to polish floors, or will you keep it shut in your little wardrobe?

898
01:11:59,821 --> 01:12:03,591
迪奥的裙子是为了让人惊喜而设计的。
A Dior dress is designed to astonish and delight.

899
01:12:03,624 --> 01:12:05,793
你要怎么做，哈里斯太太?
How will you do that, Mrs. Harris?

900
01:12:05,827 --> 01:12:11,464
你……原谅我这么说，但你不是什么人，隐形人。
You... Forgive me for saying this, but you are nobody, invisible.

901
01:12:11,498 --> 01:12:14,602
你将如何赋予这条裙子它应有的生命?
How will you give this dress the life it deserves?

902
01:12:16,871 --> 01:12:18,773
这是我的梦想。
It's my dream.

903
01:12:19,807 --> 01:12:21,909
我的钱和其他人的一样好。
And my money's as good as anybody else's.

904
01:12:21,943 --> 01:12:23,811
当然可以。嗯。
Bien sûr. Hmm.

905
01:12:23,845 --> 01:12:27,447
你可以买下你的梦想，但你会用它做什么呢?
You may buy your dream, but what will you do with it?

906
01:12:29,482 --> 01:12:31,786
是的,可以。
Oui, entrez.

907
01:12:32,687 --> 01:12:36,023
哈里斯太太，这是给你的。
Mrs. Harris, these are for you.

908
01:12:36,057 --> 01:12:37,424
哦。
Ooh.

909
01:12:37,457 --> 01:12:39,727
勒侯爵先生送的。
From Monsieur le Marquis.

910
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,762
哦。
Oh.

911
01:12:41,796 --> 01:12:44,599
他希望你明天来喝茶。
He wishes that you visit for tea tomorrow.

912
01:12:44,632 --> 01:12:46,466
沙萨尼侯爵?
Le Marquis de Chassagne?

913
01:12:46,499 --> 01:12:48,970
但是…他收到没有。
But... he receives nobody.

914
01:12:49,937 --> 01:12:52,372
但我是个无名小卒，不是吗?
But I am nobody, aren't I?

915
01:13:00,982 --> 01:13:04,652
我从没想过像迪奥这样的地方会有问题。
I never thought a place like Dior would have problems.

916
01:13:05,519 --> 01:13:09,891
我看到那条裙子，就想到了梦想和童话。
I saw that dress, and I thought of dreams and fairy tales.

917
01:13:09,924 --> 01:13:12,760
是的，我们就像童话故事。
Yes, we are like a fairy tale.

918
01:13:12,793 --> 01:13:15,563
可爱但不真实。
Lovely but not real.

919
01:13:15,596 --> 01:13:17,565
今天有这个地方吗?
Is there a place for that today?

920
01:13:17,598 --> 01:13:19,767
哦，我们需要梦想。
Oh, we need our dreams.

921
01:13:20,568 --> 01:13:22,536
现在更是如此。
Now more than ever.

922
01:13:31,545 --> 01:13:33,948
如果你能拥有这个，为什么还要迪奥?
If you can have this, why do you need Dior?

923
01:13:33,981 --> 01:13:37,618
高级时装对我们和我们的客户来说是一种虚荣。
Haute couture is a vanity for us and our clients.

924
01:13:37,652 --> 01:13:41,188
事实上，我不认为迪奥品牌能生存下去。
In truth, I don't think the House of Dior can survive.

925
01:13:41,222 --> 01:13:43,591
不，亲爱的，那太悲剧了。
No, love, that would be a tragedy.

926
01:13:43,624 --> 01:13:45,593
你不能让这种事发生。
You can't allow that to happen.

927
01:13:45,626 --> 01:13:50,598
嗯，我有个主意，但需要一种新的思维方式。
Well, I have an idea, but it requires a new way of thinking.

928
01:13:50,631 --> 01:13:52,199
什么?专横的靴子挡道了?
What? Bossy Boots in the way?

929
01:13:52,233 --> 01:13:55,503
科尔伯特夫人，她守卫圣殿。
Madame Colbert, she guards the temple.

930
01:13:55,536 --> 01:13:57,939
她让一个清洁女工买了一件迪奥的礼服。
She let a cleaning lady buy a Dior gown.

931
01:13:57,972 --> 01:13:59,073
有钱能使鬼推磨
Money talks.

932
01:13:59,106 --> 01:14:02,843
是的，你知道它说什么，所以你必须做点什么。
Yes, and you know what it says, so you have to do something about it.

933
01:14:02,877 --> 01:14:05,680
我知道你可以。你真是太聪明了。
I know you can. You're ever so clever.

934
01:14:06,614 --> 01:14:08,149
你是唯一相信的人。
You're the only one who believes.

935
01:14:12,987 --> 01:14:16,090
这是怎么回事?
What's going on here?

936
01:14:16,123 --> 01:14:17,959
看起来像首映礼。
It looks like a premiere.

937
01:14:17,992 --> 01:14:19,093
噢!
Ooh!

938
01:14:19,126 --> 01:14:21,862
哦,令人兴奋。
Oh, exciting.

939
01:14:22,863 --> 01:14:24,966
那是让·法布尔，电影明星。
Oh, that's Jean Fabre, the movie star.

940
01:14:28,269 --> 01:14:30,204
难道他不知道吗?
Mm, and don't he know it?

941
01:14:40,948 --> 01:14:43,751
哦,这是娜塔莎!噢!
Oh, it's Natasha! Oh!

942
01:14:50,658 --> 01:14:53,027
-娜塔莎!奥奥!-你在干什么?不,不。
- Natasha! Ooh-ooh! - What are you doing? No, no.

943
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:55,262
-娜塔莎!——没有。
- Natasha! - No.

944
01:14:55,296 --> 01:14:57,098
你好。
Hello.

945
01:14:57,131 --> 01:14:58,265
晚上好，哈里斯太太。
Good evening, Mrs. Harris.

946
01:14:58,299 --> 01:14:59,967
你看起来可爱。
You look lovely.

947
01:15:00,001 --> 01:15:01,736
谢谢你！
Thank you.

948
01:15:01,769 --> 01:15:03,771
晚上好,先生Fauvel。
Bonsoir, Monsieur Fauvel.

949
01:15:05,639 --> 01:15:09,777
晚上好。我们不知道你是…我们只是路过。
Bonsoir. Um, we didn't know you were, uh... We were just passing.

950
01:15:10,978 --> 01:15:13,247
你们俩今晚有什么安排?
So, what are you two doing this evening?

951
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:15,182
——哦,嗯…哦。娜塔莎。
- Oh, well... Oh. - Natasha.

952
01:15:15,216 --> 01:15:17,318
对不起。我必须走了。
I'm sorry. I-I must go.

953
01:15:17,351 --> 01:15:18,686
很高兴见到你。
It was great to see you.

954
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:20,788
哦,是的。再见,爱。
Oh, yeah. Ta-ta, love.

955
01:15:32,666 --> 01:15:34,935
我想这只是作秀。
I think it's just for show.

956
01:15:35,803 --> 01:15:37,772
我不确定他是否适合结婚。
I'm not sure that he's the marrying kind.

957
01:15:37,805 --> 01:15:45,246
哈里斯太太，我求你了，在我被羞辱死之前，你得停止这事。-哦…请。够了!
Mrs. Harris, I-I beg of you, you-you need to stop this coupling thing - before I die of humiliation. - Oh... Please. Enough!

958
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:47,148
好吧。我不是聋子。
All right. I'm not deaf.

959
01:15:48,349 --> 01:15:50,084
我当然爱上娜塔莎了。
Of course I'm in love with Natasha.

960
01:15:50,117 --> 01:15:51,685
我是说，谁不是呢?
I mean, who isn't?

961
01:15:51,719 --> 01:15:55,589
我很抱歉，但生活不全是月光和电影。
I'm sorry, but life is not all moonlight and movies.

962
01:15:55,623 --> 01:15:57,224
为什么不能呢?
Why can't it be?

963
01:15:57,258 --> 01:16:00,194
我一个人待了太久，希望自己的生命快点结束。
I've spent too long on my own, wishing my life away.

964
01:16:00,227 --> 01:16:02,163
你不会想做同样的事情。
You don't want to do the same thing.

965
01:16:03,397 --> 01:16:07,768
哈里斯太太，我觉得你的浪漫之梦很适合巴黎。
Mrs. Harris, I think your dreams of romance fit Paris very well.

966
01:16:08,669 --> 01:16:12,573
原谅我，也许是你想要恋爱。
Forgive me, but perhaps it is you who wishes to be in love.

967
01:16:13,674 --> 01:16:15,843
你必须关注自己的内心。
You who must attend to your own heart.

968
01:16:22,683 --> 01:16:25,086
来吧，艾迪，说点什么，亲爱的。
Come on, Eddie, say something, love.

969
01:16:27,721 --> 01:16:30,991
试着弄明白这一切，因为我做不到。
Try and make some sense of this, 'cause I can't.

970
01:16:36,397 --> 01:16:38,599
这都是你干的。
This is all your doing.

971
01:16:40,701 --> 01:16:43,637
准备好带你的女朋友去巴黎。
Coming up with the readies to get your girl to Paris.

972
01:16:47,174 --> 01:16:48,876
巴黎。
Paris.

973
01:16:53,047 --> 01:16:54,949
满足一个人吗?
To meet someone?

974
01:16:59,153 --> 01:17:00,688
啊。
Ah.

975
01:17:03,157 --> 01:17:04,391
好吗?
Shall we?

976
01:17:17,104 --> 01:17:21,175
迪奥的姑娘们说我的裙子快做好了。
The girls at Dior say my dress is almost finished.

977
01:17:21,208 --> 01:17:23,644
是的。可能明天吧。
Yeah. Maybe tomorrow.

978
01:17:24,445 --> 01:17:27,148
然后我会…我要回家了。
And then I'll be... I'll be back off home.

979
01:17:31,252 --> 01:17:32,453
是的,它是可爱的。
Yeah, it's lovely.

980
01:17:32,486 --> 01:17:35,689
真的,真的可爱。
Really, really lovely.

981
01:17:35,723 --> 01:17:38,159
欢迎那位垃圾女士。
That rubbish lady's welcome to hers.

982
01:17:39,426 --> 01:17:41,095
讽刺的是。
And here's the irony.

983
01:17:41,128 --> 01:17:50,037
迪奥先生为美丽的女人创作了优美的诗歌，赞美她们的清新和完美，却看到她们被破旧的衣服带走。
Monsieur Dior makes exquisite poems for beautiful women in celebration of their freshness and perfection only to see them carried away by old frumps.

984
01:17:51,338 --> 01:17:53,073
就像那个可怕的阿瓦隆夫人。
Like that dreadful Madame Avallon.

985
01:17:53,107 --> 01:17:55,176
哦,是的。
Oh, yeah.

986
01:17:55,209 --> 01:18:03,217
然而，当然，也有一些人保持着某种难以言喻的魅力，一种难以言喻的诱惑。
Whereas, of course, there are those who retain a certain je ne sais quoi, an indefinable allure.

987
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:04,985
啊。
Ah.

988
01:18:05,019 --> 01:18:08,756
请允许我为您奉上一壶英国茶。
Allow me to present to you a pot of English tea.

989
01:18:08,789 --> 01:18:10,324
哦，只是工作。
Oh, just the job.

990
01:18:10,357 --> 01:18:12,393
嗯。谢谢,玛丽亚。
Hmm. Merci, Maria.

991
01:18:12,426 --> 01:18:14,795
现在我们让大麻酿出来。
And now we let the pot brew.

992
01:18:14,828 --> 01:18:16,964
-这是正确的形式，对吗?-没错。
- Is that the correct form, yes? - That's the ticket.

993
01:18:16,997 --> 01:18:19,066
我得给你织个茶壶套。
I'll have to knit you a tea cozy.

994
01:18:20,067 --> 01:18:30,110
是的，由于我一直不清楚的原因，我在六岁的时候被送到温莎的一所寄宿学校，在那里我养成了对茶和一切英国事物的爱好。
Yes, for reasons that were never clear to me, I was sent as a boy of six to a boarding school in Windsor, and that's where I acquired a taste for tea and of all things English.

995
01:18:31,245 --> 01:18:34,815
等的时候，我想让你看个东西。
While we wait, there's something I would like you to see.

996
01:18:34,848 --> 01:18:36,917
跟我来。
Come with me.

997
01:18:42,524 --> 01:18:43,891
在那里。
There.

998
01:18:43,924 --> 01:18:45,859
哦。哦。
Oh. Oh.

999
01:18:45,893 --> 01:18:48,095
六岁了，可怜的小家伙。
Six years old, you poor mite.

1000
01:18:48,128 --> 01:18:51,098
嗯，家里也好不到哪里去。
Well, home was not much better.

1001
01:18:51,131 --> 01:18:52,499
但是，是的，我很痛苦。
But yes, I suffered.

1002
01:18:52,534 --> 01:18:54,902
我是个软弱的小男孩，总是被人欺负。
I was a weak little boy, perpetually bullied.

1003
01:18:54,935 --> 01:18:57,071
哦。
Oh.

1004
01:18:58,138 --> 01:19:05,547
你知道吗，我一看到你，我心里就有了共鸣。
You know, as soon as I saw you, I felt this connection in my heart.

1005
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:11,819
我不知道，也许……你的微笑，你的善良，你的……你的英语幽默。
I don't know, perhaps... your smile, your kindness, your... your English humor.

1006
01:19:11,852 --> 01:19:17,157
我知道你让我想起了一个人，一个对我很重要的人，但是谁?
I knew you reminded me of someone, someone very dear to me, but who?

1007
01:19:17,191 --> 01:19:24,532
就在昨天，当我回忆的时候，我才意识到有一个人在照顾我。
And only yesterday, as I searched my memories, did I realize there was a person who took care of me.

1008
01:19:24,566 --> 01:19:31,506
她的一生是一个不知疲倦的苦工，但她找到时间安慰我，擦干我的眼泪。
Her life was one of tireless drudgery, and yet she found the time to comfort me and dry my tears.

1009
01:19:31,539 --> 01:19:36,143
她叫马多克斯太太，但我们以前都叫她拖把太太。
Her name was Mrs. Maddox, but we used to call her Mrs. Mops.

1010
01:19:36,176 --> 01:19:37,911
在那里。
There.

1011
01:19:41,949 --> 01:19:45,286
我让你想起了莫普太太?
I-I remind you of Mrs. Mops?

1012
01:19:45,319 --> 01:19:47,354
——啊,是的。——清洁工吗?
- Ah, yes. - The cleaner?

1013
01:19:48,322 --> 01:19:54,361
莫普斯太太擦干我的眼泪，让我再次微笑，就像你，哈里斯太太，这几天一样。
Mrs. Mops dried my tears and made me smile again, as you have, Mrs. Harris, these past few days.

1014
01:19:55,929 --> 01:19:59,233
我真希望戴尔芬能认识你。
I do wish my Delphine could have known you.

1015
01:20:00,602 --> 01:20:06,006
你看，你安慰那些需要帮助的人，却不求任何回报。
You see, you give comfort to those in need without asking anything in return.

1016
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:08,842
是这样吗?
Is that right?

1017
01:20:09,943 --> 01:20:12,046
你是这样看我的吗?
Is that how you see me?

1018
01:20:12,079 --> 01:20:14,281
你明白我们之间为什么有联系了吧?
You see why there is a connection between us?

1019
01:20:16,317 --> 01:20:20,454
现在，我们来喝杯英式茶，好吗?
Now, let's have a nice cup of English tea, shall we?

1020
01:20:20,487 --> 01:20:24,291
不用了，谢谢。
Uh, no, thank you.

1021
01:20:25,627 --> 01:20:27,194
我最好现在就走。
I'd best be getting along.

1022
01:20:27,227 --> 01:20:29,330
他们在发廊等我。
They're expecting me at the salon.

1023
01:21:06,153 --> 01:21:08,406
Avallon,肮脏的老板!
Avallon, dirty boss!

1024
01:21:08,489 --> 01:21:10,283
阿瓦隆，在垃圾箱里!
Avallon, in the bin!

1025
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:11,909
我们会让你腐烂的，阿瓦隆!
We will make you rot, Avallon!

1026
01:21:11,939 --> 01:21:13,474
玛格丽特?
Marguerite?

1027
01:21:15,409 --> 01:21:16,944
有什么事吗?
What's the matter?

1028
01:21:23,384 --> 01:21:25,052
在你去。
In you go.

1029
01:21:27,488 --> 01:21:29,691
你放这些女孩走是怎么回事?
What's this about you letting all these girls go?

1030
01:21:29,724 --> 01:21:31,024
哦。你还好吗，亲爱的?
Ooh. You all right, love?

1031
01:21:31,058 --> 01:21:34,461
如果他们像你一样免费工作，那就没有必要了。
It would not be necessary if they worked for free, as you do.

1032
01:21:34,495 --> 01:21:37,264
他们需要工作。他们还要养家糊口。
They need their jobs. They've got families to feed.

1033
01:21:37,297 --> 01:21:38,365
Excusez-moi。
Excusez-moi.

1034
01:21:38,399 --> 01:21:41,603
是的，很遗憾，但这不关你的事。
Yes, it is very sad, but this is not of your concern.

1035
01:21:41,636 --> 01:21:43,404
好吧，我们走着瞧吧。
Well, we'll see about that.

1036
01:21:43,437 --> 01:21:47,307
拜托，夫人，你已经把这里的每个角落都翻遍了。
Please, madame, you have reached into every corner of this establishment.

1037
01:21:47,341 --> 01:21:50,545
我坚持要求你尊重我们的隐私。
Now, I insist that you respect our privacy.

1038
01:21:50,578 --> 01:21:52,012
嗯。
Hmm.

1039
01:21:52,045 --> 01:21:53,648
你要去哪儿，哈里斯太太?
Where are you going, Mrs. Harris?

1040
01:21:53,681 --> 01:21:55,449
去见老板。
To see the boss.

1041
01:21:55,482 --> 01:21:57,351
——你不能。没有。-来吧，姑娘们。
- You cannot. No. - Come on, girls.

1042
01:21:57,384 --> 01:21:59,486
——请。没有。,跟我来。轻快地,急速地。
- Please. No. - Follow me. Vite, vite.

1043
01:22:03,157 --> 01:22:04,559
来吧，姑娘们。来吧。
Here we go, girls. Come on.

1044
01:22:04,592 --> 01:22:05,959
下来的工具。
Down tools.

1045
01:22:05,993 --> 01:22:07,995
来，到我后面来。加入我们的行列。
Come on, get behind me. Join us.

1046
01:22:08,028 --> 01:22:09,564
是啊，今天有个很重要的工作。
Yeah, got a really important job today.

1047
01:22:09,597 --> 01:22:11,307
-哦，你看起来很可爱，但是拜托-哈里斯太太!
- Ooh, you look lovely, but come on. - Mrs. Harris!

1048
01:22:11,331 --> 01:22:13,967
-来为我做这件事。-哈里斯太太!
- Come and do this for me. - Mrs. Harris!

1049
01:22:14,001 --> 01:22:15,670
你必须立刻停止这件事。
You must stop this at once.

1050
01:22:15,703 --> 01:22:17,505
你根本不知道自己在做什么。
You have no idea what you are doing.

1051
01:22:17,539 --> 01:22:18,972
哦，是的，我喜欢。
Oh, yes, I do.

1052
01:22:19,006 --> 01:22:20,374
这叫罢工。
It's called a strike.

1053
01:22:22,577 --> 01:22:24,144
好了，女士们，来吧。拜托!
Right, ladies, come on. Please!

1054
01:22:24,178 --> 01:22:26,113
跟我来。没时间了，亲爱的。
Follow me. No time for that, dear.

1055
01:22:26,146 --> 01:22:28,382
Oi !没必要推推搡搡。来吧。
Oi! No need to push and shove. Come on.

1056
01:22:28,527 --> 01:22:29,612
呆在这儿!
Stay here!

1057
01:22:29,737 --> 01:22:31,364
玛格丽特，你怎么了?
Marguerite, what's got into you?

1058
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:32,530
你呆在这里!
You stay here!

1059
01:22:34,087 --> 01:22:36,957
站起来，André。还有工作要做。
On your feet, André. There's work to be done.

1060
01:22:38,579 --> 01:22:41,040
这都是你的错，福维尔先生。做点什么。
This is all your fault, Monsieur Fauvel. Do something.

1061
01:22:41,207 --> 01:22:42,833
你觉得我能阻止这个女人吗?
Do you think I can stop this woman?

1062
01:22:42,917 --> 01:22:43,917
逮捕她!
Arrest her!

1063
01:22:44,043 --> 01:22:46,212
我是共产主义者，夫人。我站在她这边。
I'm a communist, Madame. I'm on her side.

1064
01:22:46,754 --> 01:22:47,754
让我通过吧!
Let me pass!

1065
01:22:48,402 --> 01:22:50,605
哈里斯太太，求你了，别这么做。
Mrs. Harris, I beg of you, do not do this.

1066
01:22:50,638 --> 01:22:58,445
这是你的机会，André，在你的一生中，你能得到多少机会呢?——不,看起来……迪奥先生，请占用您十分钟的时间。
This is your chance, André, and how many chances - do you get in your lifetime? - No, look... Monsieur Dior, ten minutes of your time, please.

1067
01:22:58,479 --> 01:23:01,448
这就是福维尔先生拯救公司所需要的一切。
That's all Mr. Fauvel needs to save the company.

1068
01:23:01,482 --> 01:23:05,216
我吗?我怎么…迪奥先生，对不起。
Me? What do I-I... Monsieur Dior, I am sorry.

1069
01:23:05,217 --> 01:23:07,454
继续,宠物。你能做到的。告诉他你的计划。
Go on, pet. You can do it. Tell him your plan.

1070
01:23:07,488 --> 01:23:09,456
——嗯…——继续。
- Uh... - Go on.

1071
01:23:11,278 --> 01:23:16,742
一个没有优雅，没有区别，没有迪奥的世界，不，这是不可能的。
A world without elegance, without distinction, without Dior, no, it's impossible.

1072
01:23:16,909 --> 01:23:20,746
然而，迪奥品牌如何才能克服目前的问题呢?
Yet how can the House of Dior surmount its current problems?

1073
01:23:22,670 --> 01:23:29,777
迪奥不是让全世界都来到蒙田大道，而是要让所有人都能买到迪奥的产品。
Rather than the world coming to Avenue Montaigne, Dior must go out to the world with a range of goods available to all.

1074
01:23:29,811 --> 01:23:36,383
香水，长筒袜，奢侈品…普通女人都买得起。
Uh, perfume, stockings, luxury that... that the ordinary woman can afford.

1075
01:23:36,637 --> 01:23:39,098
那将不再是迪奥之家。
That would no longer be the House of Dior.

1076
01:23:39,265 --> 01:23:40,766
它将不再是高级时装。
It would no longer be haute couture.

1077
01:23:40,933 --> 01:23:43,602
我们的声誉建立在我们的独家。
Our reputation is founded on our exclusivity.

1078
01:23:43,728 --> 01:23:45,229
停下来,性格。
Stop, Loulou.

1079
01:23:45,292 --> 01:23:46,426
是的。
Oui.

1080
01:23:49,108 --> 01:23:50,860
福维尔先生，你有十分钟的时间。
Monsieur Fauvel, you have ten minutes.

1081
01:23:51,833 --> 01:23:53,300
什么?
What?

1082
01:23:54,536 --> 01:23:56,336
哦,对了。
Oh, right.

1083
01:23:56,370 --> 01:23:58,438
祝你好运,爱。
Good luck, love.

1084
01:24:05,916 --> 01:24:07,460
你也一样。
And you as well.

1085
01:24:23,731 --> 01:24:25,465
谢谢。
Merci.

1086
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:28,230
我们罢工赢了!
We've won the strike!

1087
01:24:28,355 --> 01:24:30,274
把阿瓦隆扔进监狱!
Throw Avallon in jail!

1088
01:24:32,943 --> 01:24:34,487
为工人们干杯!
Here's to the workers!

1089
01:24:46,874 --> 01:24:52,296
十年前，当迪奥(House of Dior)推出第一个系列时，排他性是关键，这是真的。
Ten years ago, when the House of Dior presented its first collection, exclusivity was key, it's true.

1090
01:24:52,894 --> 01:24:59,701
但今天，出现了一个新女性，一个现代女性，她知道自己想要什么，需要能够买到它。
But today, there's a new woman, a modern woman who knows what she wants and needs to be able to buy it.

1091
01:24:59,734 --> 01:25:02,235
今天，哈里斯太太来了。
Today, there's Mrs. Harris.

1092
01:25:02,269 --> 01:25:04,171
哦。
Oh.

1093
01:25:04,204 --> 01:25:11,512
maître同意我们的计划意味着，我们不仅不会失去工作，还需要更多的工作。
The maître's agreement to our plan means that, far from losing jobs, we will need more.

1094
01:25:11,546 --> 01:25:13,881
很多很多更多。
Many, many more.

1095
01:25:24,525 --> 01:25:26,259
万岁!
Bravo!

1096
01:25:48,516 --> 01:25:50,450
你确定是这条街吗?
Are you sure this is the right street?

1097
01:25:50,484 --> 01:25:53,253
必须。我每个月都在这里给她寄支票。
Must be. This is where I send her check every month.

1098
01:25:53,286 --> 01:25:54,922
里面不会有一粒灰尘。
There won't be a speck of dust inside.

1099
01:25:54,956 --> 01:25:57,357
你可以用生命来打赌。
You can bet your life.

1100
01:25:58,225 --> 01:26:01,294
这是它。
This is it.

1101
01:26:06,901 --> 01:26:08,201
没有。
No.

1102
01:26:08,235 --> 01:26:09,570
别烦我。
Leave me in peace.

1103
01:26:09,604 --> 01:26:10,772
只是一个字。
Just a word.

1104
01:26:10,805 --> 01:26:12,974
为什么?我承认。
Why? I concede.

1105
01:26:13,007 --> 01:26:15,442
胜利属于你，哈里斯太太。
The victory is yours, Mrs. Harris.

1106
01:26:15,462 --> 01:26:17,756
科尔伯特夫人，求你了。
Madame Colbert, I beg you.

1107
01:26:29,393 --> 01:26:30,394
那里是谁?
Who's there?

1108
01:26:32,229 --> 01:26:35,232
没什么，别担心。我马上回来。
It's nothing, don't worry. I'll be right back.

1109
01:26:35,608 --> 01:26:37,109
他们想要什么?
What do they want?

1110
01:26:37,276 --> 01:26:38,277
别担心。
Don't worry.

1111
01:26:39,634 --> 01:26:43,705
我的丈夫…他在战争中受伤了。
My husband... He was damaged in the war.

1112
01:26:43,738 --> 01:26:45,272
他需要经常照料。
He requires constant care.

1113
01:26:45,305 --> 01:26:47,642
你要么做，要么付钱。
Which you either do or pay for.

1114
01:26:47,675 --> 01:26:49,443
难怪你在前面摆那么多。
No wonder you got all that front on you.

1115
01:26:49,476 --> 01:26:51,546
请说你想要什么。
Say what you want, please.

1116
01:26:51,579 --> 01:26:54,582
夫人，很抱歉冒犯了您。
Madame, I'm so sorry to have offended you.

1117
01:26:54,615 --> 01:27:03,725
我对您怀有崇高的敬意，我从未想过强迫您改变……你描述的未来很有道理，但我不想成为其中的一部分。
I hold you in the highest regard, and it was never my intention to force a change on... The future you describe makes perfect sense, but I want no part of it.

1118
01:27:03,758 --> 01:27:05,860
哦,不,请。
Uh, no, please.

1119
01:27:05,893 --> 01:27:07,360
你千万别想离开。
You must not think of leaving.

1120
01:27:07,394 --> 01:27:12,499
也许我在我的岗位上呆得太久了，在伟大的男人背后做了太久的隐形女人。
Perhaps I have been too long in my post, too long the invisible woman behind the great man.

1121
01:27:12,533 --> 01:27:14,001
战斗说话。
Fighting talk.

1122
01:27:14,035 --> 01:27:15,570
你走到哪里,女孩。
You go, girl.

1123
01:27:15,603 --> 01:27:19,874
我不像你那样是个革命者，哈里斯太太。
I'm not a revolutionary like you, Mrs. Harris.

1124
01:27:19,907 --> 01:27:22,442
我只是想一个人待着。
I simply wish to be left alone.

1125
01:27:23,376 --> 01:27:30,585
嗯,那是……这一切都很好，而且上帝知道这是你应得的，但你知道没有你，它会崩溃的，不是吗?
Well, that's... that's all fine and dandy, and Lord knows you deserve it, but you know it'll fall apart without you, don't you?

1126
01:27:30,618 --> 01:27:32,720
相信我，我看过很多次了。
Trust me, I've seen it over and over.

1127
01:27:32,754 --> 01:27:36,624
当这位女士起身离开时，这位先生坚持不了十分钟。
When the lady ups and leaves, the gent don't last ten minutes.

1128
01:27:37,759 --> 01:27:39,694
你需要的。
You're needed.

1129
01:27:39,727 --> 01:27:41,662
现在更是如此。
Now more than ever.

1130
01:27:41,696 --> 01:27:44,331
还有谁能保证一切正常呢?
Who else is gonna keep things up to scratch?

1131
01:27:44,364 --> 01:27:46,701
不是André或迪奥先生。
Not André or Monsieur Dior.

1132
01:27:46,734 --> 01:27:49,537
两个男人能知道什么?
What would two men know about that?

1133
01:27:50,538 --> 01:27:53,808
你和我，你知道，我们是一模一样的。
You and me, you know, we're two peas in a pod.

1134
01:27:53,841 --> 01:27:57,912
我们清理每个人的烂摊子，把花园里的一切都弄得很漂亮。
We clean up everybody's mess and make everything in the garden lovely.

1135
01:27:57,945 --> 01:27:59,446
我们是他们依赖的人。
We're the ones they rely on.

1136
01:27:59,479 --> 01:28:05,385
他们甚至不知道我们是干什么的，但就像鸡蛋就是鸡蛋一样，没有我们，一切都会完蛋。
They don't even know what we do, but as sure as eggs is eggs, without us, it all goes tits up.

1137
01:28:11,959 --> 01:28:16,396
也许需要与le maître进行一次对话。
Perhaps a conversation with le maître is required.

1138
01:28:18,132 --> 01:28:20,601
也许。
Perhaps.

1139
01:28:21,702 --> 01:28:24,539
明天，你告诉娜塔莎你的感受。
And tomorrow, you tell Natasha how you feel.

1140
01:28:24,572 --> 01:28:27,108
但是娜塔莎小姐已经离开迪奥了。
Oh, but Mademoiselle Natasha has left Dior.

1141
01:28:27,141 --> 01:28:29,544
她的离开巴黎。
She's leaving Paris.

1142
01:28:29,577 --> 01:28:33,648
和你一样，哈里斯太太，她也想追寻自己的梦想。
Like you, Mrs. Harris, she wishes to follow her dream.

1143
01:28:38,553 --> 01:28:40,463
继续找,爱。她一定在这里的某个地方。
Keep looking, love. She's got to be here somewhere.

1144
01:28:40,487 --> 01:28:42,089
她走了。这是最好的选择。
She's gone. It's for the best.

1145
01:28:42,123 --> 01:28:48,095
如果你不……你马上就会被狠狠地揍一顿。坚持下去。
You're gonna get yourself a good clip round the ear in a minute if you don't... Hang on.

1146
01:28:48,129 --> 01:28:50,463
等一下。我知道。
Hang on a minute. I know.

1147
01:29:00,041 --> 01:29:01,576
这里。
Here.

1148
01:29:03,978 --> 01:29:05,646
哦。
Oh.

1149
01:29:06,647 --> 01:29:07,648
哦。
Oh.

1150
01:29:07,682 --> 01:29:09,717
哦。夫人迪奥。
Oh. Madame Dior.

1151
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:10,985
Magnifique。
Magnifique.

1152
01:29:11,018 --> 01:29:13,721
哦，好吧，你自己也不错。
Oh, well, not so bad yourself.

1153
01:29:15,455 --> 01:29:17,658
我们在找一个女孩。
Uh, we're looking for a girl.

1154
01:29:17,692 --> 01:29:21,762
嗯,她是……她有点不高兴。
Um, she's... she's a bit upset.

1155
01:29:22,763 --> 01:29:26,779
嗯…你见过的最聪明，最可爱的女人。
Um... The most intelligent, the most adorable woman you've ever seen.

1156
01:29:26,901 --> 01:29:29,604
她是迪奥的模特。
She's a Dior model.

1157
01:29:31,325 --> 01:29:32,534
那边那个?
That one over there?

1158
01:29:33,541 --> 01:29:35,442
——哦,娜塔莎。娜塔莎。
- Oh, Natasha. - Natasha.

1159
01:29:38,082 --> 01:29:39,458
发生了什么事?
What happened?

1160
01:29:41,716 --> 01:29:44,018
这种生活，不适合我。
This life, it's-it's not for me.

1161
01:29:44,051 --> 01:29:46,020
不，当然不是。
No, of course it isn't.

1162
01:29:46,053 --> 01:29:49,190
被钉在基座上，像个漂亮的洋娃娃一样到处招摇。
Stuck on a pedestal, paraded around like a beautiful doll.

1163
01:29:49,223 --> 01:29:52,026
谁都看得出来那女孩不想要。
Anyone can see the girl doesn't want it.

1164
01:29:52,059 --> 01:29:54,461
哈里斯太太说得对。
Mrs. Harris is right.

1165
01:29:54,494 --> 01:29:56,496
我不是这样的人。
It's not who I am.

1166
01:29:56,530 --> 01:30:02,770
正如萨特所说，你会发现自己在être-en-soi和être-pour-soi之间存在矛盾。
As Sartre would say, y-you find yourself conflicted between être-en-soi et être-pour-soi.

1167
01:30:03,671 --> 01:30:05,907
介于"自为"和"自在"之间
Between "for itself" and "in itself."

1168
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:13,648
Être-en-soi是指人类生活中涉及意识的那些方面，而物理事实是être-pour-soi。
Être-en-soi being those aspects of human life that involves consciousness, whereas physical facts are être-pour-soi.

1169
01:30:15,035 --> 01:30:16,453
存在主义者!
Existentialists!

1170
01:30:16,483 --> 01:30:19,053
在这种情况下，事情就会变回原来的样子。
In which case, things would be what they are not.

1171
01:30:19,086 --> 01:30:20,688
没错。
Exactement.

1172
01:30:20,721 --> 01:30:24,926
物是人非，物是人非。
Things are what they are not, and they're not what they're not.

1173
01:30:30,665 --> 01:30:34,235
André，看在上帝的份上，吻她吧。
André, for God's sake, just kiss her.

1174
01:30:34,268 --> 01:30:36,871
是的。看在上帝的份上，吻我吧。
Yes. For God's sake, just kiss me.

1175
01:30:40,007 --> 01:30:41,876
嗯。
Hmm.

1176
01:30:50,571 --> 01:30:52,698
娜塔莎，和我一起留在巴黎吧。
Stay in Paris with me, Natasha.

1177
01:30:54,074 --> 01:30:56,368
但我已经告诉迪奥先生了。
But I have already told Monsieur Dior.

1178
01:30:56,743 --> 01:30:58,620
你仍然可以学习哲学。
You can still study philosophy.

1179
01:30:59,997 --> 01:31:02,862
使不可见的东西变得可见。
To make the invisible visible.

1180
01:31:02,863 --> 01:31:05,700
你没在巴黎找到爱情吗，迪奥夫人?
You did not find love in Paris, Madame Dior?

1181
01:31:05,733 --> 01:31:08,602
-哦,不。没有。——哦。
- Oh, no. No. - Oh.

1182
01:31:11,272 --> 01:31:17,878
我以为已经太晚了，但是……现在我不太确定了。
I thought it was too late, but... now I'm not so sure.

1183
01:32:16,370 --> 01:32:18,672
——你好,爱。——你好,艾达。
- Hello, love. - Hello, Ada.

1184
01:32:54,108 --> 01:32:57,678
哦。好吧，好吧。
Oh. All right, all right.

1185
01:32:57,711 --> 01:32:59,013
戈登·班尼特。
Gordon Bennett.

1186
01:32:59,046 --> 01:33:01,315
好吧。
All right.

1187
01:33:01,348 --> 01:33:03,184
好吧。
All right.

1188
01:33:03,217 --> 01:33:04,685
哦,你好,爱。进来。
Oh, hello, love. Come in.

1189
01:33:04,718 --> 01:33:06,087
谢天谢地你回来了。
Oh, thank God you're back.

1190
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:07,388
哦，不会太久。
Oh, well, not long.

1191
01:33:07,421 --> 01:33:08,956
你想喝杯茶吗?
Do you want a cuppa?

1192
01:33:08,989 --> 01:33:10,391
没时间。
No time.

1193
01:33:10,424 --> 01:33:12,726
-这是紧急情况——哦。对
- This is an emergency. - Oh. Right.

1194
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:15,629
好吧，深呼吸，告诉我怎么了。
Okay, well, deep breath and tell me what's up.

1195
01:33:15,663 --> 01:33:21,635
我不能去，但如果我不去…给人留下好印象是很重要的，你知道吗?
I can't go, but if I don't... Oh, it's so important to make a good impression, you know?

1196
01:33:21,669 --> 01:33:23,871
我做的事。你想给谁留下好印象?
I do. Who you trying to impress?

1197
01:33:23,904 --> 01:33:25,840
制片人科恩戈尔德先生。
Mr. Korngold, the producer.

1198
01:33:25,873 --> 01:33:28,242
我要和他一起参加Café Royal饭店的盛大晚宴。
I'm to partner him to the big dinner at the Café Royal.

1199
01:33:28,275 --> 01:33:30,177
——哦。-所有人都会去。
- Ooh. - Everybody will be there.

1200
01:33:30,211 --> 01:33:32,146
这是一个无价的机会。
It's a priceless opportunity.

1201
01:33:32,179 --> 01:33:33,848
但看。
But look.

1202
01:33:38,085 --> 01:33:43,724
哦，好吧，是有点…有点皱了，但我们可以马上把它蒸出来，亲爱的。
Oh, well, yeah, it's a bit... it's a bit crumpled, but we can steam that out in a jiffy, love.

1203
01:33:43,757 --> 01:33:45,893
-别担心。——不,看。
- Don't you worry. - No, look.

1204
01:33:45,926 --> 01:33:47,094
哦。
Oh.

1205
01:33:47,995 --> 01:33:51,932
哦,亲爱的。是啊，不好好泡上一段时间是洗不出来的。
Oh, dear. Yeah, that's not gonna come out without a good, long soak.

1206
01:33:51,966 --> 01:33:54,702
我不知道缎子会不会喜欢。
I'm not sure the satin's gonna like that.

1207
01:33:54,735 --> 01:33:55,903
你没有别的了吗?
Ain't you got another one?

1208
01:33:55,936 --> 01:33:57,180
那件漂亮的蓝色连衣裙怎么样?
What about that lovely blue dress?

1209
01:33:57,204 --> 01:33:59,240
-在洗衣店。——哦。
- It's at the cleaner's. - Oh.

1210
01:33:59,273 --> 01:34:01,142
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my God.

1211
01:34:01,175 --> 01:34:03,878
我要死了。
I'm going to die.

1212
01:34:03,911 --> 01:34:05,880
好吧。来吧,现在。这就够了。
All right. Come on, now. That's enough.

1213
01:34:05,913 --> 01:34:08,382
没人想听这个。
Nobody wants to hear that.

1214
01:34:08,415 --> 01:34:10,417
但你不明白。
But you don't understand.

1215
01:34:10,451 --> 01:34:13,220
科恩戈尔德笔下几乎所有的女孩都成了明星。
Nearly all Mr. Korngold's girls become stars.

1216
01:34:13,254 --> 01:34:18,726
这是我摆脱陈规，最终被人看到的机会。
It's my chance to lift myself out of the rut and be seen at last.

1217
01:34:18,759 --> 01:34:21,395
被人看见并不代表一切，亲爱的。
Well, being seen isn't everything, love.

1218
01:34:21,428 --> 01:34:24,131
对我来说是。
It is for me.

1219
01:34:37,211 --> 01:34:39,813
来吧。站起来。
Come on. Stand up.

1220
01:34:39,847 --> 01:34:41,248
今天是你的幸运日。
It's your lucky day.

1221
01:34:41,282 --> 01:34:43,217
什么?
What?

1222
01:34:43,250 --> 01:34:44,818
为什么?
Why?

1223
01:34:45,452 --> 01:34:46,954
因为我想我能帮你。
'Cause I think I can help you.

1224
01:34:46,987 --> 01:34:48,455
你刚说你不能。
You just said you couldn't.

1225
01:34:48,489 --> 01:34:51,225
如果你不起来，我什么也做不了。
I can't do anything if you don't get up.

1226
01:34:55,963 --> 01:34:56,931
正确的。
Right.

1227
01:34:56,964 --> 01:34:59,833
脱掉你的衣服。你可以借我的裙子穿。
Take off your clothes. You can borrow my dress.

1228
01:35:03,170 --> 01:35:04,805
别荒谬。
Don't be ridiculous.

1229
01:35:04,838 --> 01:35:07,441
照我说的做，少说点废话。
Just do as I say, and a bit less of your nonsense.

1230
01:35:07,474 --> 01:35:09,743
到屏幕后面去。
Go on, behind the screen.

1231
01:35:18,252 --> 01:35:20,087
哈里斯太太吗?
Mrs. Harris?

1232
01:35:27,194 --> 01:35:29,163
哦。
Oh.

1233
01:35:29,196 --> 01:35:31,432
你们看起来很可爱，鸭子们。
You look lovely, ducks.

1234
01:35:31,465 --> 01:35:33,867
只是机票。
Just the ticket.

1235
01:35:34,935 --> 01:35:36,837
你的旅行怎么样?我应该问。
How was your trip? I should've asked.

1236
01:35:36,870 --> 01:35:38,973
-你去哪儿了?——哦。
- Where did you go? - Oh.

1237
01:35:39,006 --> 01:35:42,109
巴黎。是的,它是……你说你只会离开一天。
Paris. Yeah, it was... You said you'd only be gone a day.

1238
01:35:42,142 --> 01:35:44,345
没有你，一切都毁了。
Everything went to pieces without you.

1239
01:35:44,378 --> 01:35:45,813
这是不可思议的。
It was magical.

1240
01:35:45,846 --> 01:35:48,449
我是说，你知道我有多整洁…正常。
I mean, you know how tidy I am... normally.

1241
01:35:48,482 --> 01:35:50,150
那么浪漫。
So romantic.

1242
01:35:51,151 --> 01:35:52,486
太太H。
Mrs. H.

1243
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:54,121
你的黑马。
You dark horse.

1244
01:35:54,154 --> 01:35:56,123
哦。
Oh.

1245
01:35:57,559 --> 01:35:58,993
哦,上帝。这是他。
Oh, God. That's him.

1246
01:35:59,026 --> 01:36:01,996
哦。那么，他知道到哪里来了?
Oh. He knew where to come, then?

1247
01:36:02,830 --> 01:36:05,266
我知道你会救我的，亲爱的。
I knew you'd rescue me, darling.

1248
01:36:05,299 --> 01:36:06,534
你是我的仙女教母。
You're my fairy godmother.

1249
01:36:37,464 --> 01:36:39,300
你好。
Hello.

1250
01:36:50,144 --> 01:36:51,945
彭罗斯小姐吗?
Miss Penrose?

1251
01:36:53,548 --> 01:36:55,949
哦。
Oh.

1252
01:37:22,109 --> 01:37:26,246
亲爱的H太太:这件衣服很抱歉，但请不要担心。
Dear Mrs. H, Sorry about the dress, but please don't worry.

1253
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:27,414
我很好。
I'm okay.

1254
01:37:31,018 --> 01:37:36,457
我正对着镜子看我的口红，突然就着火了。
I was checking my lipstick in the mirror when suddenly I went up in flames.

1255
01:37:42,996 --> 01:37:47,368
要不是有个乐于助人的朋友来救我，我可能已经被烤焦了。
I might have burnt to a crisp if a helpful friend hadn't come to my rescue.

1256
01:37:53,541 --> 01:37:56,276
科恩戈尔德先生说我应该起诉。
Mr. Korngold says I should sue.

1257
01:37:57,478 --> 01:37:59,313
去我妈家养病了。
Gone to my mum's to recover.

1258
01:39:56,731 --> 01:39:58,365
艾达?
Ada?

1259
01:39:58,398 --> 01:40:00,100
你在吗?
You there?

1260
01:40:01,703 --> 01:40:03,738
是的。
Yeah.

1261
01:40:03,771 --> 01:40:05,507
对不起,Vi。
Sorry, Vi.

1262
01:40:12,547 --> 01:40:15,650
你放弃了吗，女人?
You give up the ghost, woman?

1263
01:40:15,683 --> 01:40:18,252
你想吓死我们吗?
You want to scare us to death?

1264
01:40:18,285 --> 01:40:20,254
好吧，阿奇?
Oh, all right, Archie?

1265
01:40:20,855 --> 01:40:23,725
抱歉弄坏了你的门。
Uh, sorry about your door.

1266
01:40:23,758 --> 01:40:28,095
呃，她是…最好的意图。
Uh, she was, um... Best intentions and all.

1267
01:40:31,533 --> 01:40:33,801
我去拿些玻璃，好吗?
I'll get some glass, yeah?

1268
01:40:33,835 --> 01:40:35,803
把它修好，像新的一样。
Fix it up good as new.

1269
01:40:35,837 --> 01:40:37,271
谢谢你！
Thank you.

1270
01:40:50,350 --> 01:40:52,787
好吧，一个字都不用说了。
Well, there's no need to say a word.

1271
01:40:52,820 --> 01:40:54,589
你是著名的。
You're famous.

1272
01:40:54,622 --> 01:40:58,125
至少你放弃一切去买的那条裙子是。
At least the dress you gave up everything to go and get is.

1273
01:40:58,158 --> 01:41:01,261
你为什么要给那个没用的女孩?
Why you give it to that no-good girl, eh?

1274
01:41:01,295 --> 01:41:04,666
你太软弱了，这是事实。
You're too soft, and that's the truth.

1275
01:41:05,667 --> 01:41:08,068
它必须被看到。
It had to be seen.

1276
01:41:08,836 --> 01:41:11,071
只有正确的。
It's only right.

1277
01:41:12,472 --> 01:41:14,709
哦,六世。
Oh, Vi.

1278
01:41:14,742 --> 01:41:17,277
我从来没穿过。
I never got to wear it.

1279
01:41:17,912 --> 01:41:19,614
甚至没有一次。
Not even once.

1280
01:41:20,615 --> 01:41:23,551
艾达，我亲爱的。
Oh, Ada, my darling.

1281
01:41:24,552 --> 01:41:27,454
我很抱歉，嗯?
I'm so sorry, eh?

1282
01:41:28,590 --> 01:41:30,357
嘿。
Hey.

1283
01:41:30,390 --> 01:41:32,694
我们不需要花哨的服装。
We don't need no fancy dresses.

1284
01:41:32,727 --> 01:41:40,100
我们去军团舞会上抖抖尾羽，他们都会盯着我们看。
We'll go shake our tail feather down at the Legion Dance, and they'll all be looking at us.

1285
01:41:42,770 --> 01:41:44,371
哦。
Aw.

1286
01:41:49,844 --> 01:41:51,613
哦，早上好，纽科姆先生。
Oh, morning, Mr. Newcombe.

1287
01:41:51,646 --> 01:41:52,890
假期愉快吗，哈里斯太太?
Enjoy your holiday, Mrs. Harris?

1288
01:41:52,914 --> 01:41:54,247
非常感谢。
Very much, thank you.

1289
01:41:54,281 --> 01:41:56,216
想念你对这个地方的触摸。
Missed your touch about the place.

1290
01:41:56,249 --> 01:41:57,885
哦。
Oh.

1291
01:41:57,919 --> 01:41:59,687
你还好吗?
Are you quite all right?

1292
01:42:01,709 --> 01:42:03,543
今天不太舒服。
Not quite meself today.

1293
01:42:04,324 --> 01:42:06,360
甚至不知道那是谁。
Not sure who that is, even.

1294
01:42:06,393 --> 01:42:09,496
有点生存危机。
Bit of an existential crisis.

1295
01:42:10,297 --> 01:42:12,634
巴黎会这样对你的。
Paris will do that to you.

1296
01:42:12,667 --> 01:42:14,636
别灰心，H太太。
Chin up, Mrs. H.

1297
01:42:14,669 --> 01:42:16,771
革命即将到来。
The revolution is coming.

1298
01:42:49,837 --> 01:42:53,875
你读过那个穿着迪奥礼服自焚的女孩吗?
Did you read about the girl who set fire to herself in a Dior gown?

1299
01:42:54,180 --> 01:42:57,679
可怕的宣传噱头，我想。
Ghastly publicity stunt, I suppose.

1300
01:42:57,712 --> 01:43:00,347
这是多么的浪费。
What a waste.

1301
01:43:06,386 --> 01:43:08,723
请接受我的通知，唐太斯夫人?
Will you please accept my notice, Lady Dant?

1302
01:43:10,390 --> 01:43:14,729
我要求你在这周末之前把你的账全部结清。
I will require full and final settlement of your account by the end of the week.

1303
01:43:14,762 --> 01:43:16,203
你不能离开我。
You can't leave me.

1304
01:43:17,474 --> 01:43:21,781
那种把别人当人渣对待，还指望别人忠诚的日子已经过去了。
Them days are over when you can treat people like scum and expect loyalty in return.

1305
01:43:24,110 --> 01:43:26,070
是的。美好的一天,夫人。
Yeah. Good day, milady.

1306
01:43:27,688 --> 01:43:29,242
那就这样吧。
There you go.

1307
01:43:31,278 --> 01:43:33,715
很快就会好的。
Be right as rain in no time.

1308
01:43:35,650 --> 01:43:37,819
那是谁呢?
Who's that, then?

1309
01:43:43,953 --> 01:43:45,249
Ada哈里斯夫人?
Mrs. Ada Harris?

1310
01:43:45,274 --> 01:43:47,742
-请在这里签名。——哦。
- Sign here, please. - Oh.

1311
01:43:53,568 --> 01:43:55,970
——谢谢。-就一会儿。有更多的。
- Thank you. - Just a mo'. There's more.

1312
01:43:56,003 --> 01:43:57,538
更多?
More?

1313
01:44:02,877 --> 01:44:04,779
哦。
Oh.

1314
01:44:05,646 --> 01:44:07,380
你确定吗?今天不是我的生日。
Are you sure? It's not me birthday.

1315
01:44:07,414 --> 01:44:09,070
你是艾达·哈里斯吗?
You are Ada Harris?

1316
01:44:09,398 --> 01:44:11,438
嗯，我也不确定。
Well, not sure about that, either.

1317
01:45:00,001 --> 01:45:09,510
Chère哈里斯夫人，我们希望您返回伦敦的旅途愉快，但我们被在社交页面上看到的一张照片所困扰。
Chère Madame Harris, We hope your return journey to London was pleasant, but we were troubled by a photo we saw in the social pages.

1318
01:45:09,544 --> 01:45:14,582
我们立刻意识到你又一次太仁慈了。
We knew immediately that once again you had been too kind.

1319
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:16,644
你弄错了!停!
You've got it wrong! Stop!

1320
01:45:16,851 --> 01:45:18,562
看来垃圾大王这是个错误，我告诉你!
It seems the rubbish king It's a mistake, I'm telling you!

1321
01:45:18,586 --> 01:45:21,421
偷他工人的钱
Was stealing from his workers.

1322
01:45:21,454 --> 01:45:23,406
乔治!乔治!
Georges! Georges!

1323
01:45:23,431 --> 01:45:29,864
由于他的资产被查封，阿瓦隆夫人没有参加最后的试衣，也没有为她的衣服付账。
Since his assets were seized, Madame Avallon failed to attend her final fitting or settle the bill for her dress.

1324
01:45:30,865 --> 01:45:33,100
我们保留了你所有的测量数据，当然是85。
We kept all your measurements, of course, Eighty-five.

1325
01:45:33,134 --> 01:45:36,149
很快就能帮你修改了。
And were quickly able to alter it for you.

1326
01:45:36,469 --> 01:45:41,352
如果它需要任何最后的调整，我们知道你有能力自己做这些。
If it needs any final adjustments, we know you have the skill to do these yourself.

1327
01:45:44,094 --> 01:45:46,523
我们都同意这是克里斯汀·迪奥的办公室。我在听。
We all agreed it was Office of Christian Dior. I'm listening.

1328
01:45:46,547 --> 01:45:48,115
这是我们能做的。
The least we could do.

1329
01:45:48,149 --> 01:45:51,384
宣传使订单大大增加。
The publicity has resulted in a great increase in orders.

1330
01:45:55,933 --> 01:45:58,394
请你把这些包起来好吗?
Could you wrap these up please?

1331
01:45:58,993 --> 01:46:03,898
你一定会认出这些花是玛格丽特公主的喜悦。
You will no doubt recognize these blooms as Princess Margaret's Delight.

1332
01:46:03,931 --> 01:46:10,771
我们希望你喜欢这些花，并让你的新裙子远离明火。
We hope you enjoy the flowers and that you will keep your new dress well away from naked flames.

1333
01:46:23,651 --> 01:46:28,623
我们把它送给你，表达我们所有的爱和最热烈的感谢。
We send it to you with all our love and our very warmest thanks.

1334
