3
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:52,995
English?

4
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:56,999
An Englishwoman.

5
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:40,292
Are you hungry?

6
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:24,169
Well, no. It's over.

7
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:27,756
They've had enough.

8
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:40,018
Here we are, we've arrived.

9
00:33:40,144 --> 00:33:42,062
The great House of Dior.

10
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:46,066
Good luck, English lady.

11
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:08,380
Hold them back as best you can.
She won't be long, I'm sure.

12
00:34:11,175 --> 00:34:12,134
Excuse me, Madame.

13
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:15,304
Clumsy girl!

14
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:19,475
André, what is going on?
I could have been hurt!

15
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,240
-Are you all right?
-Don't touch me!

16
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:00,349
Careful, careful, careful!

17
00:35:48,272 --> 00:35:49,356
Ah, the Countess.

18
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,483
Good day, Baroness von Tiesenhausen.

19
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,987
Hello, Madame.

20
00:35:58,198 --> 00:36:00,075
Hello, Madame.

21
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:01,910
Here you are.

22
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:11,378
Madame Avallon!
Such elegance, as always.

23
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:14,047
Mathilde, how you've changed.

24
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:25,434
How has this unfortunate creature
been allowed in?

25
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:27,394
The woman is clearly deranged.

26
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:32,733
A department store.

27
00:36:45,913 --> 00:36:47,289
Have her removed at once.

28
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:57,633
It's real money, Madame Colbert.

29
00:36:57,758 --> 00:37:00,093
If only everyone could do the same...

30
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:08,143
Today, Monsieur Dior will reveal
his 10th Anniversary Collection.

31
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,479
Nothing must detract for this occasion.

32
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:40,008
Girls, you will never believe
what's just happened.

33
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:42,469
There's a cleaning lady from London
who's going to buy a dress.

34
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:44,846
-A cleaning lady?
-Yes, a Dior gown!

35
00:37:44,972 --> 00:37:46,682
She arrived with all her money.

36
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:48,934
And Madame Colbert
didn't know where to put herself.

37
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:53,188
Natasha, you must come and see her.
She's so wonderful!

38
00:37:54,231 --> 00:37:55,524
Look! Look!

39
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,651
Ladies.

40
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:04,700
She saved up all her pennies
to come and see us!

41
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:10,122
There she is, just next to
the Marquis de Chassagne.

42
00:38:12,374 --> 00:38:13,333
You see?

43
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:15,127
What's going on?

44
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:17,879
Back to work!

45
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:19,715
Quick!

46
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:33,705
This can't be true.

47
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:34,956
Her again!

48
00:39:37,793 --> 00:39:38,794
This won't do.

49
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,587
I'm sorry, Madame Avallon.

50
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,089
We will find you a more suitable seat.

51
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:44,633
No! These are our usual seats.

52
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:48,136
We will endure this indignity
but it won't end here.

53
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:15,580
Number one,

54
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:17,082
the Bar Suit.

55
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,928
Number two,

56
00:40:42,399 --> 00:40:44,151
Number three,

57
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:54,452
Number four, Cocotte.

58
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:15,891
Number 42, Cabaret.

59
00:41:16,016 --> 00:41:19,853
Dinner dress in champagne satin chiffon.

60
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:56,264
Cocktail dress in black satin
with white polka dots.

61
00:45:39,446 --> 00:45:40,488
Sales girl?

62
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:43,741
You know our arrangements.

63
00:45:48,705 --> 00:45:50,457
Yes, Madame Avallon, how can I help you?

64
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:51,583
I've made my choice.

65
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:55,128
-Very good, Madame Avallon.
-Temptation, number 89.

66
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:36,688
Yes. Yes, exactly.

67
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:18,313
The atelier has nothing to do.

68
00:48:18,438 --> 00:48:19,772
But to devote itself to this one order?

69
00:48:19,856 --> 00:48:21,733
A cash sale, Madame.
Given our circumstances...

70
00:48:21,858 --> 00:48:25,653
Very well, Monsieur Fauvel.
It seems you are in charge now.

71
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:33,161
Off you go. Don't just stand there.

72
00:48:58,019 --> 00:48:58,978
Quick, quick, quick.

73
00:49:16,913 --> 00:49:18,039
Thirteen.

74
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:24,962
Eighty-two.

75
00:49:28,216 --> 00:49:29,550
Sixty-two.

76
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:32,400
What's happened?

77
00:52:43,703 --> 00:52:48,416
I am embarrassed beyond words
that you have seen the state of...

78
00:52:48,541 --> 00:52:49,709
I haven't had time to...

79
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:52,211
No, please, it was nothing.

80
00:52:52,295 --> 00:52:53,254
Allow me...

81
00:52:54,714 --> 00:52:56,924
-I'm sorry.
-No, I'm sorry.

82
00:52:57,049 --> 00:52:58,759
No, it's me, I shouldn't have...

83
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:48,225
Frog in the...?

84
00:53:48,768 --> 00:53:50,227
In the ditch.

85
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:02,073
Being and Nothingness.

86
00:54:02,782 --> 00:54:03,741
You are reading Sartre?

87
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,300
I need to speak to you
about some of the alterations

88
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:27,635
requested by Princess Margaret.

89
00:56:36,477 --> 00:56:38,062
Let's go, Monsieur Carré.

90
00:58:16,702 --> 00:58:18,370
Where are you?

91
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:24,251
Sorry.

92
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:35,596
No, it doesn't work.

93
01:05:18,332 --> 01:05:19,333
Stupid cretin!

94
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:20,584
Idiot! Clear off!

95
01:05:30,552 --> 01:05:32,304
Out! Out! Avallon out!

96
01:05:33,889 --> 01:05:35,515
Avallon, you dirty stinker!

97
01:05:35,641 --> 01:05:36,600
Chuck him in the bin!

98
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:44,251
So, Monsieur Carré...

99
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:13,525
Mrs Harris?

100
01:09:13,608 --> 01:09:15,068
Are you all right?

101
01:09:27,622 --> 01:09:30,166
Mrs Harris asked
if she's gone to heaven.

102
01:09:32,711 --> 01:09:34,170
Ladies!

103
01:09:35,297 --> 01:09:36,423
Quick, quick. Back to work!

104
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:48,018
Do you think this fabric
could work well for Aphrodite?

105
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:50,937
Yes, I love the color.

106
01:09:51,062 --> 01:09:53,064
-May I show Monsieur Carré?
-Certainly.

107
01:09:57,903 --> 01:09:59,946
Monsieur Carré, this fabric
is even more luxurious.

108
01:10:00,113 --> 01:10:01,865
Perhaps we could use it for...?

109
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:15,253
We have found some common ground,
the little sparrow and I.

110
01:10:18,423 --> 01:10:20,091
She's a capable seamstress.

111
01:10:23,678 --> 01:10:26,139
What could go wrong with buttons?

112
01:11:29,411 --> 01:11:30,954
Cheers!

113
01:21:06,153 --> 01:21:08,406
Avallon, dirty boss!

114
01:21:08,489 --> 01:21:10,283
Avallon, in the bin!

115
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:11,909
We will make you rot, Avallon!

116
01:22:22,146 --> 01:22:23,689
Please!

117
01:22:28,527 --> 01:22:29,612
Stay here!

118
01:22:29,737 --> 01:22:31,364
Marguerite, what's got into you?

119
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:32,490
You stay here!

120
01:22:38,579 --> 01:22:41,040
This is all your fault, Monsieur Fauvel.
Do something.

121
01:22:41,207 --> 01:22:42,833
Do you think I can stop this woman?

122
01:22:42,917 --> 01:22:43,876
Arrest her!

123
01:22:44,043 --> 01:22:46,212
I'm a communist, Madame.
I'm on her side.

124
01:22:46,754 --> 01:22:47,672
Let me pass!

125
01:23:03,604 --> 01:23:05,314
Monsieur Dior, I am sorry.

126
01:23:11,278 --> 01:23:13,239
A world without elegance,

127
01:23:13,364 --> 01:23:15,408
without distinction, without Dior,

128
01:23:15,574 --> 01:23:16,742
no, it's impossible.

129
01:23:16,909 --> 01:23:20,746
Yet how can the House of Dior
surmount its current problems?

130
01:23:36,637 --> 01:23:39,098
That would no longer be
the House of Dior.

131
01:23:39,265 --> 01:23:40,766
It would no longer be haute couture.

132
01:23:40,933 --> 01:23:43,602
Our reputation
is founded on our exclusivity.

133
01:23:43,728 --> 01:23:45,229
Stop, Loulou.

134
01:23:49,108 --> 01:23:50,860
Monsieur Fauvel, you have ten minutes.

135
01:24:05,916 --> 01:24:07,460
And you as well.

136
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:28,230
We've won the strike!

137
01:24:28,355 --> 01:24:30,274
Throw Avallon in jail!

138
01:24:32,943 --> 01:24:34,487
Here's to the workers!

139
01:24:46,874 --> 01:24:49,835
Ten years ago, when the House of Dior
presented its first collection,

140
01:24:50,002 --> 01:24:52,296
exclusivity was key, it's true.

141
01:26:15,462 --> 01:26:17,756
Madame Colbert, I beg you.

142
01:26:29,393 --> 01:26:30,394
Who's there?

143
01:26:32,229 --> 01:26:35,232
It's nothing, don't worry.
I'll be right back.

144
01:26:35,608 --> 01:26:37,109
What do they want?

145
01:26:37,276 --> 01:26:38,277
Don't worry.

146
01:29:24,276 --> 01:29:26,779
The most intelligent, the most
adorable woman you've ever seen.

147
01:29:31,325 --> 01:29:32,534
That one over there?

148
01:29:38,082 --> 01:29:39,458
What happened?

149
01:30:15,035 --> 01:30:16,453
Existentialists!

150
01:30:50,571 --> 01:30:52,698
Stay in Paris with me, Natasha.

151
01:30:54,074 --> 01:30:56,368
But I have already told Monsieur Dior.

152
01:30:56,743 --> 01:30:58,620
You can still study philosophy.

153
01:30:59,997 --> 01:31:02,875
To make the invisible visible.

154
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:16,644
You've got it wrong! Stop!

155
01:45:16,769 --> 01:45:18,312
It's a mistake, I'm telling you!

156
01:45:30,867 --> 01:45:33,077
Eighty-five.

157
01:45:44,213 --> 01:45:46,174
Office of Christian Dior. I'm listening.

158
01:45:55,933 --> 01:45:58,394
Could you wrap these up please?
