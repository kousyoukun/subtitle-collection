1
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:15,635
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Daytona 500,

2
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,971
the Super Bowl of motor racing events.

3
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,931
awalking onto the grid is the two-time

4
00:02:20,016 --> 00:02:23,143
Daytona 500 and defending champion
Rowdy Burns.

5
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:28,648
And perennial contender ffom Reading,
Pennsylvania, Aldo Bennedetti.

6
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,961
Gentlemen, start your engines.

7
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:35,465
Big turn back for
number 43, Richard Petty.

8
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,801
Petty spins to the inside of the track.

9
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:39,594
A tough break for Richard Petty.

10
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:43,014
Richard Petty is out of the Daytona 500.

11
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,724
Speaking of people
who are out of the race,

12
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:47,727
perhaps it's time to remember
the legendary crew chief, Harry Hogge,

13
00:03:47,812 --> 00:03:51,564
whose great driver, Buddy Bretherton,
died here last year in a fiery crash,

14
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:55,110
hitting the wall at over
195 miles an hour.

15
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,532
-So you're enjoying the good life, Harry?
-Yeah.

16
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:03,660
l never minded spreading a little
fertilizer around now and then.

17
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,412
There's worse things.

18
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:08,123
-How's the truck running?
-Runs good.

19
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:13,211
l want you to build me a car.

20
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:22,220
Now, Tim, everybody knows
some downtown car dealer

21
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,721
can't afford a race team.

22
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:26,766
No driver worth a damn
is gonna sign with you.

23
00:04:26,851 --> 00:04:29,602
'Cause they wreck one car,
you can't afford to build them another

24
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:31,229
and they're out of the deal, you know.

25
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:34,065
And no car's gonna win without a driver.

26
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,775
Not even mine.

27
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,028
lf you built the car, l'd get a damn driver.

28
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,619
What kind of driver are you going to
find after the season's started?

29
00:04:46,704 --> 00:04:51,124
Some old boy who's washed up
and wasn't worth a shit to begin with.

30
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,792
You can work with him.

31
00:04:52,877 --> 00:04:55,336
You can build a driver
like you build a car, Harry.

32
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:57,088
Tim, take a look at that hound.

33
00:04:57,173 --> 00:04:59,632
That's the best coon dog
l've ever seen or heard about.

34
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:03,386
-And l didn't teach him a damn thing.
-Well, l got somebody.

35
00:05:03,471 --> 00:05:05,847
-Who?
-Take a look at him.

36
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:08,725
Anybody l gotta take a look at,
ain't somebody.

37
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,935
Then take a look at nobody.

38
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:17,150
Look, Tim, l gave up racing.
You gotta know that. All right?

39
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,277
You didn't give up racing, Harry.

40
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:22,947
You quit to avoid an investigation
into Buddy's crash at Daytona.

41
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:26,201
Hey, l didn't avoid
any goddamn investigation.

42
00:05:27,912 --> 00:05:30,497
Anyway, l talked to NASCAR

43
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,916
and if you come back in
there won't be any investigation.

44
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,335
How the hell did you sell them
on that deal?

45
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:36,878
l'm a hell of a salesman.

46
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,260
Now, that's a racecar driver.

47
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:48,848
When's your driver due?

48
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,480
Harry tells me your guy runs
those lndy type deals.

49
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,023
Yeah. Sprints, mainly.

50
00:05:57,107 --> 00:06:00,485
Two World of Outlaw championships,
three all-star wins,

51
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,530
seven straight feature wins
and he's been driving ASA.

52
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:04,656
Hey.

53
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,743
Got yourself a real statistician there.
Does he know anything about drivers?

54
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,286
We'll see.

55
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:19,587
Harry, where'd you say
your driver's from?

56
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:21,089
Eagle Rock.

57
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:24,759
lt's up around Wilkesboro, isn't it?

58
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,928
No. Glendale, California.

59
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,221
He's a Yankee?

60
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:31,808
Not exactly. lf you're from California,
you're not a Yankee.

61
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,018
You're not really anything.

62
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:36,104
You said it.

63
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:53,997
The shocks are right,
we're dialed in, buddy.

64
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,957
Don't change a thing.

65
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:01,588
Hey, you ain't buried in
horse manure after all.

66
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:05,091
-Looking pretty good.
-You're the one who's looking good.

67
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:08,386
lt hadn't been easy, Harry,
l'll guran-damn-tee you,

68
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:10,388
but this bitch is ready to run.

69
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:12,181
l can't tell you how much
we all appreciate

70
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:14,767
you letting us use the car, Rowdy.

71
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,605
l told you about this, Rowdy.

72
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:19,772
Harry's got some new driver

73
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:21,774
and he needs a car
just to turn a couple of laps.

74
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:26,195
l told you it was Harry Hogge who'd
asked us personally, as a favor.

75
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:32,535
Who is this driver?

76
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:07,153
Tim tells me you've been
running open-wheels.

77
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,113
That's right.

78
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:12,116
And now you just want to
up and drive NASCAR?

79
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:14,035
That's right.

80
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,079
What do you know about
stock car racing?

81
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:19,457
Well, l've watched it
on television, of course.

82
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:22,210
You've seen it on television?

83
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:24,295
ESPN, the coverage is excellent.

84
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,422
You'd be surprised
at how much you can pick up.

85
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,424
l'm sure l would.

86
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:32,261
Look, this may not be the best time
for you to run this car.

87
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,639
Was there some problem?

88
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,892
No, sir. You all go right ahead.

89
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,602
But you bend this bitch
the least little bit,

90
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:42,105
l'm gonna tear your balls off.

91
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:54,867
Okay. Would you mind very much
holding on to this?

92
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,788
Didn't he hear what that man said?

93
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:05,211
Hold on a minute.
Don't you think we ought to talk?

94
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:08,047
What? About how l'm gonna run? Sure.

95
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:10,925
About how you've managed
to live as long as you have.

96
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,928
Look, l ain't gonna let you race this car.

97
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:26,065
-What's going on?
-He's had second thoughts.

98
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,651
-You said you'd look at him.
-l've looked at him.

99
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:31,404
l paid $2,500 to use
this track today, Harry.

100
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,741
Forget it. He needs a brand name
like Exxon or Richard Petty.

101
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:37,910
Well, l know a damn race driver
when l see one.

102
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,957
What's going on, Harry?
ls this happening or what?

103
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,251
Do us all a favor, Harry.

104
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:55,720
Let me drive.
l won't make a fool out of you.

105
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,147
That tunnel turn's real tricky.

106
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,775
Now, whether it's hot or cold,
it gets as slick as a butt.

107
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:12,361
Then you'll slip and slide and slam
yourself into the wall before you know it.

108
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,238
So just take it easy.

109
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:28,044
-l'm dropping the hammer.
-No, you're not.

110
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,996
lt's under Rowdy's time.

111
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:07,750
Well, it might have been better
if he cracked up the car.

112
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,976
-That was fast.
-Yeah?

113
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:27,061
Thirty-one flat.

114
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:30,857
That's good enough to take the pole
in the last race here.

115
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:36,320
Hell, l thought this was gonna be a joke.

116
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:39,323
-You never drove a stock car before?
-No, sprints mainly.

117
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:41,701
-What's your name?
-Buck Bretherton. What's yours?

118
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:43,953
Cole Trickle.
lt's damn nice to meet you, Buck.

119
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,372
Damn nice to meet you, too, Cole.

120
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,499
You were one lucky son of a bitch
in that tunnel turn.

121
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:50,209
That car was way out of shape.

122
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:53,546
Well, if you think it was luck,
let's do it again.

123
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,716
-You run good.
-Thank you.

124
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,720
Now, go get your own car
and we'll see how you do in a crowd.

125
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:06,225
So, how come you don't stick
to open wheels?

126
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,102
l lost my ride.

127
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:12,481
After two championships
and seven straight wins, you were fired?

128
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:14,150
l lost my ride.

129
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,652
Doesn't matter. l'd have quit regardless.

130
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:19,405
-Why's that?
-l wasn't going anywhere.

131
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,325
-Where do you want to go?
-lndianapolis.

132
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,328
But you can't win in lndy
without a great car.

133
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:26,829
And my name's not Andretti or Unser.

134
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:29,248
On the other hand, stock cars
are stock cars. Pretty much the same.

135
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,335
Hey, there's nothing stock
about a stock car.

136
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,254
Look, l'm not trying to insult you.

137
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,840
All l'm saying is,
stock cars are built to run equal.

138
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:40,343
-lsn't that right?
-So the rule books say.

139
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,637
So l don't have to worry
about getting beat by another car.

140
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:43,804
ln other words,
all you have to worry about

141
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:46,724
-is getting beat by other drivers.
-Yeah.

142
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:50,645
You build me a car,
and l'll win Daytona next year.

143
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:59,820
l'm gonna give you an engine
low to the ground.

144
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:04,617
Extra-big oil pan
that'll cut the wind from underneath you.

145
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,080
That'll give you 30 to 40
more horsepower.

146
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:15,795
l'm gonna give you a fuel line
that'll hold an extra gallon of gas.

147
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:20,299
l'm gonna shave half an inch off you
and shape you like a bullet.

148
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:23,719
And when we get you primed,
painted and weighed,

149
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:28,307
you're going to be ready to go out
on that racetrack. You hear me?

150
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:33,396
You're gonna be perfect.

151
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,472
Okay.
l'm going to pull this rookie's chain.

152
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:56,604
Cole, you're wandering
all over the track.

153
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:59,148
Yeah. Well, that son of a bitch
just slammed into me.

154
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:02,068
No, he didn't slam into you,
he didn't bump you, he didn't nudge you.

155
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:05,154
He rubbed you,
and rubbing, son, is racing.

156
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:16,415
There goes the fender.

157
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:20,836
There goes the quarter panel.

158
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:44,527
All right. Get back!

159
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,701
All right,
while we're still under a caution,

160
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:56,247
l want you to go back out on that track
and hit the pace car.

161
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:59,166
-Hit the pace car?
-Hit the pace car!

162
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:00,543
What for?

163
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,837
Because you hit every other
goddamn thing out there.

164
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:06,257
l want you to be perfect. Now, go on.
Go! Go! Go!

165
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,441
You're going too high. Stay in the group.

166
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:49,341
How about that?
This side we don't have to fix.

167
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:55,514
l don't want you spoiled, Buck.

168
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:14,116
This is gonna hurt.

169
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:16,202
Move! Move! Move!

170
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:21,207
Did you see that guy?

171
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:35,679
l've got to pit.

172
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:37,640
l don't think so. We're busy now.

173
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:41,644
-You're what?
-We're eating ice cream.

174
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:43,312
lce cream?

175
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:55,908
Now, you're welcome to
come on and get one,

176
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:56,992
but l don't believe NASCAR

177
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:59,453
would think much of you trying to eat
an ice cream cone out there.

178
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,664
You have enough trouble
riding around the track as it is.

179
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,473
Take it easy.

180
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,643
Come on now, Cole!

181
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:24,937
Cole! Cole!

182
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:34,321
We messed up big-time on Sunday.

183
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:37,241
l had sponsors in the stands

184
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:39,535
and l'm hugging and holding hands

185
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:43,831
and kissing them in the air
and praying for a good showing.

186
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:45,833
And what do we do?

187
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:49,712
We end up looking like
a monkey fucking a football out there.

188
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:53,173
Everybody out, please.

189
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:56,218
Except you two.

190
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:06,145
l've got a question.

191
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:10,357
What is the one thing you absolutely
need to do to win a race?

192
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:13,110
-lt's pretty damn obvious...
-You keep quiet!

193
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:15,404
You need to finish the race.

194
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:19,158
Tim, l realize Harry's been around
a long time.

195
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:21,785
l'm not saying that his ways
are antiquated

196
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,496
but it'd help to have a car that handled
properly and didn't blow engines.

197
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:27,124
Well, if he wouldn't get excited
and over rev the son of a bitch,

198
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,001
the engine wouldn't blow.

199
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:32,004
Now, Cole, when you shift the gear,

200
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:34,214
and that little needle on the tach
goes into the red

201
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:38,469
and reads 9,000 rpm, that's bad.

202
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:43,891
lt's also my fault if the tires blow,
if you ask this old fart.

203
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:45,184
Well, hell yes, it's your fault.

204
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:46,977
There's 40 other vultures out there

205
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:49,063
who managed to finish the race
on their tires.

206
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:51,982
You see Darrell Waltrip
using up his tires?

207
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:53,692
There's nothing l can't do
with a racecar.

208
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,152
Well, that's the difference
between you and me.

209
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:57,488
-There's only so much l can do!
-That's obvious.

210
00:19:57,614 --> 00:20:00,407
Harry, he doesn't need to appreciate
yourjob to do his.

211
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:02,576
Well, he sure as hell does.
How can he expect to race

212
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,537
if he don't know what a racecar
can and can't do?

213
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:06,830
What is this shit, huh?

214
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:09,416
You want me to work the pit
and you drive?

215
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:11,377
Fine. We'll try that.

216
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,797
l can't talk to this son of a bitch.

217
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:21,428
l can't talk to that son of a bitch.
l really can't. l can't...

218
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:29,395
-You think he can drive?
-He can drive.

219
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:31,313
He can drive beyond
the limits of the tires,

220
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:33,565
the engine, the car, anything else.

221
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:37,569
lf the son of a bitch listened to me,
we wouldn't hardly ever lose a race.

222
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:42,741
lf we don't get us a sponsor
in the next couple of races,

223
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:44,576
my ass is fried.

224
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,916
l'm liable to be out of the car business
altogether.

225
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,003
And, Harry, l know you're great.
You know you're great.

226
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:58,090
But if the guy in the car
doesn't trust you,

227
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:00,801
we're never going to win a damn race.

228
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:14,982
Hey, Harry.

229
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:22,948
We've gotta talk, all right?

230
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:26,243
All right, Harry. Talk.

231
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:28,829
No. On the radio during the race.

232
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:31,123
Now, you wanna run right on
the ragged edge all the damn time,

233
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:34,751
you've got to tell us what's going on
with the car.

234
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:36,628
Or you just want to change
the way l drive it.

235
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:37,713
Maybe.

236
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:41,216
Well, maybe you can set up the car
so l don't have to change.

237
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:42,468
l'd be happy to.

238
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:45,220
-You just tell me how.
-What do you want to know?

239
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:46,930
Well, hell, Cole, you are the driver.

240
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:48,348
You think she's running loose or tight?
Tell us.

241
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:50,434
We give a turn here,
take some wedge out there,

242
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:53,395
we'll win some races.
That's all there is to it.

243
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,981
-l can't do that.
-Why the hell not?

244
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:59,943
Because l don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

245
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:01,904
How do you mean that?

246
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,415
Because l don't know much
about cars, okay?

247
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,958
Well, hey, Cole, that don't make you

248
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:17,044
a damn bit different
from any driver l ever met.

249
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:18,337
No, l mean, l really don't know.

250
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:21,507
l don't know what you just said about
a turn here and a wedge there.

251
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:25,177
-l don't know. l don't know.
-How can that be?

252
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:26,470
What's the difference?

253
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:30,557
They told me to get in a car and drive.
And l could drive.

254
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:33,185
The point is,
l'd like to help out but l can't.

255
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:36,104
l'm an idiot. l don't have the vocabulary.

256
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:42,903
-Well...
-Well?

257
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:48,200
We're just gonna have to
figure one out, aren't we?

258
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:53,205
Don't worry about it.

259
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:56,375
All right?

260
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:58,919
How does she feel?

261
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:04,174
Her ass is all over the place.

262
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:08,637
Well, the rear end's loose. Car's fast.

263
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:12,307
"Loose" is fast, and "on the edge,"
you're out of contfol.

264
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:18,647
Now, Cole, there is something else.

265
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,819
Tires is what wins a race.

266
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:27,364
Yeah.
What the hell are you talking about?

267
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:30,826
lf we can't figure you a way to run
so you don't melt the damn tires,

268
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,578
we can't finish a race.

269
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:34,246
So, what do you want?

270
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,747
l'll tell you what,

271
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:40,252
you run 50 laps any way you like,
then 50 laps like l want you to.

272
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:43,714
Give me an honest run.
lf you do, l'm gonna beat you.

273
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:03,400
All right. Now we're going to do
it 50 laps my way, all right?

274
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:06,111
Now, when you were
racing lndy cars out west,

275
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:10,115
the tires were twice as wide
and the car weighed half as much.

276
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:14,244
Now your car weighs twice as much
and the tires are half as wide

277
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:16,246
and you're burning them up, all right.

278
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:18,332
Now, if you do...
When you burn them up, they melt,

279
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:21,126
when they melt, they get greasy
and you slip and slide.

280
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,212
And you're out of control. All right?

281
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:26,173
Let's go!

282
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,898
His way, my way.

283
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:45,317
l was six seconds faster.

284
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:48,737
You can buy me some lunch
at the highway joint, Tim.

285
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:07,547
-What's wrong?
-We're trying to figure out what to do.

286
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,177
-About what?
-About what? We're in trouble.

287
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:14,680
Rowdy took the pole in 30.25.

288
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:17,849
We run 31 .1 0.
We're almost a second off the pace.

289
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:20,686
We're looking for some
speed out of this.

290
00:25:23,064 --> 00:25:25,107
The car's perfect, Harry.

291
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,411
lt's the first race of the season here

292
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:39,871
at the legendary
Darlington lnternational Speedway.

293
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:42,416
And the most treachefous turn
is number four.

294
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,292
30:90. Leader's 30:80.

295
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:46,878
You're running 1 2th. Thirty laps to go.

296
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:47,963
Thanks, Harry.

297
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:02,644
You're gonna burn the damn tires, Cole.
So take it easy.

298
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:06,106
Harry, l'm not going faster.
Everybody else is going slower.

299
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:08,775
He's right, Harry.
l checked his lap times.

300
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,987
We just haven't fallen off
as much as everybody else.

301
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,072
That's right. You're doing good, Cole.
You're doing real good.

302
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:15,157
You're running fifth

303
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:18,660
and you're gaining half a second
a lap on the leader.

304
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:22,831
Fifteen to go.

305
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:29,254
Don't pass on the outside of turn four.

306
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:35,177
That's right. Stay to the inside, Cole.
Ten laps to go.

307
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:40,682
And Trickle has moved
into the number two spot,

308
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:42,350
right behind Rowdy Burns.

309
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:45,645
-l'm right behind the leader.
-Five laps to go.

310
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:51,193
Remember me?

311
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:53,528
What in the hell's going on?

312
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:56,865
Just a little rubbing, Harry.
Rubbing's racing.

313
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,249
l'm going to take this rookie
once and for all.

314
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:12,380
All right, God damn it. That's enough!

315
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:15,884
You can't play with Rowdy like this.
He's gonna give you a real ass ripping.

316
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,177
Just relax, Harry.

317
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:24,559
Somebody's got to give.
And it's Rowdy Burns who's out!

318
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:27,521
No! An incredible recovery by Rowdy.

319
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:30,106
He retains his position on the lead lap.

320
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:31,483
And we have a new leader.

321
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:35,237
Cole Trickle in the number 46
City Chevrolet Car.

322
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:38,281
We're under caution
with three laps to go.

323
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:41,701
-Caution's out. Come on in.
-What for? lt's almost over.

324
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:45,413
You've been on the green for 68 laps.
Everybody's got to pit, Cole.

325
00:27:56,092 --> 00:27:57,759
Go, go! Go, go!

326
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,680
The air gun's jammed,
give me another one.

327
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:04,599
-Give me a gun. Give me a gun.
-lt's jammed. Come on, switch it, guys.

328
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:07,769
Let's go!

329
00:28:13,818 --> 00:28:17,571
-Damn it! Go! Go! Go!
-Go. Get them on quick!

330
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:30,125
God damn it! Son of a bitch!

331
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:31,751
Now, Cole...

332
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:40,385
-Son of a bitch!
-Cole, we're on the air, all right?

333
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,512
l come into the pit, l'm in first place.

334
00:28:42,597 --> 00:28:44,723
l go out, l'm in third with two laps to go.

335
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:46,892
All right.
First of all, don't get excited, all right.

336
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,394
You're in third place.
That's a pretty respectable position.

337
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:50,562
Now, what you do is this.

338
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:52,772
When they slow down into turn four,

339
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:56,067
you just keep your foot on the gas
and drive right by them on the outside.

340
00:28:56,152 --> 00:29:00,196
Harry, you told me, nobody goes
to the outside on turn four.

341
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:04,910
Well, now l'm telling you different.
lf you go to the outside, you can hold it.

342
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:06,411
He's going to end up in the wall.

343
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:09,080
All right. Cole, the pace car
is about ready to duck on off.

344
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:10,749
We don't have a whole lot of time
to talk about this.

345
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:12,083
Well, tell me how.

346
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:14,461
lt's 'cause we've got a real
good set of match tires on.

347
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:16,254
-What?
-What?

348
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:19,049
Those tires are matched perfect
and staggered special.

349
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:20,800
You're gonna get him killed.

350
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:23,011
Pace car's about ready duck on off.

351
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:26,097
lf you go to the outside, you can hold it.

352
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:28,558
All right, Harry. When it comes
to the car l'll take your word.

353
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,110
The white flag is out. One lap to go.

354
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:59,255
The boy don't have the balls
to pass me on the outside.

355
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:04,761
And they're heading
into treachefous turn four.

356
00:30:29,996 --> 00:30:30,996
Yes!

357
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:35,000
And Cole Trickle wins his
first ever NASCAR victory.

358
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:37,627
Second place goes to Rowdy Burns.

359
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,888
Cole Trickle...

360
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:52,017
Cole, did you have any idea you could
run the car wide open into that last turn

361
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:53,601
and make it stick like that?

362
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:55,812
-l knew it all along.
-How's that?

363
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:59,441
Well, in our last stop, when l came in,
Harry put on special tires.

364
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:01,693
Special tires? Harry Hogge,
what's special about them?

365
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:03,945
Well, nothing in particular.

366
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:06,948
Looks like Harry Hogge
has a little explaining to do.

367
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:08,658
You told me...

368
00:31:08,743 --> 00:31:10,869
l lied. l had to tell you something
to calm you down.

369
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:12,370
You were acting like such a candy-ass.

370
00:31:12,455 --> 00:31:15,582
After the air gun stuck, l figured
you'd never get back on the racetrack.

371
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:18,168
You son of a bitch!

372
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:25,759
Try this on for size.
We've got ourselves a sponsor.

373
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:31,765
Promise me one thing, boys,

374
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:35,393
whatever else we do from here,
we win Daytona.

375
00:31:35,978 --> 00:31:38,521
That's a promise. That's a promise.

376
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:48,073
Selling thousands of dollars worth
of useless mining stock

377
00:31:48,157 --> 00:31:51,159
and they call that a dog and pony show.

378
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:55,997
lt may be funny, but it's not that funny
when it happens to you, son.

379
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:59,793
lt happened to me.

380
00:32:00,503 --> 00:32:03,546
What?
You bought worthless mining stock?

381
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:05,757
l told you l lost my ride.

382
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:07,926
That's how l lost it.

383
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:11,930
Team owner was a conman.
Junk bonds, worthless companies.

384
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:15,350
But mainly he sold stolen yachts.

385
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,271
When l won enough races, he even
used my name to promote the sales.

386
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:22,941
He went to jail and l lost my ride.

387
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:28,947
lt was pretty humiliating, actually.

388
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:32,075
Hell, Cole, there's no need
to be embarrassed

389
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,746
by some lowlife, piece of trash
who put you in that kind of position.

390
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:39,374
-Well, Harry, that depends.
-On what?

391
00:32:40,084 --> 00:32:44,337
On whether or not you're related
to that lowlife, piece of trash.

392
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:47,590
He was my father.

393
00:32:49,385 --> 00:32:52,387
l've never really
stuck with anything since.

394
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:57,934
They don't trust me, l don't trust them.

395
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,728
You know how that goes.

396
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:02,689
Like for instance,

397
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:05,692
you lied to me today.

398
00:33:05,776 --> 00:33:08,695
lt was dumb luck
l didn't end up crashed or dead.

399
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:13,116
-l ought to punch you out.
-Yeah? Give it a try.

400
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,913
No.

401
00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:24,169
Don't wanna get my ass kicked
by a 60-year-old man.

402
00:33:25,254 --> 00:33:26,921
Fifty-nine.

403
00:33:27,006 --> 00:33:29,132
-Whoop his ass, Harry.
-Come on, Cole.

404
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,014
Oh, God. Come on.

405
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:44,522
Drivers just don't go to the outside
like that, Cole.

406
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:47,859
But l knew you could do it. l knew it.

407
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:52,113
l believed it in my heart.

408
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:59,454
-Peach or cherry?
-Cherry.

409
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:04,792
l'm taking a leak.

410
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:08,755
There you see now,
there's calculating drivers,

411
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:11,216
and then there's kamikaze drivers.

412
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:14,969
And our Cole here's a kamikaze,
like my pappy was.

413
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:18,181
-And who's that?
-Buddy Bretherton.

414
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:20,516
Buddy Bretherton was your dad?

415
00:34:22,645 --> 00:34:25,688
-He died at Daytona, didn't he?
-Last year.

416
00:34:26,774 --> 00:34:30,193
-How did it happen? Mind my asking?
-He hit the wall.

417
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:33,947
-Which turn?
-He was probably dead before he hit it.

418
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:37,325
The coroner's report showed
massive heart attack.

419
00:34:52,216 --> 00:34:53,549
l believe we've been pulled over.

420
00:34:58,681 --> 00:35:00,974
All right. Everybody out
and up against the wall here.

421
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:02,642
You're under arrest.

422
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:04,644
Let's go. Move it.

423
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:09,357
-What the hell for?
-lt's right there in your hand.

424
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:11,859
Transportation of illegal alcohol
across state lines

425
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:13,653
for the purpose of distribution.

426
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:15,280
Well, l don't know
what this looks like to you, Officer,

427
00:35:15,364 --> 00:35:18,324
but this is not distribution.
This is consumption.

428
00:35:18,409 --> 00:35:20,743
-Well, that don't exactly make it legal.
-You know what...

429
00:35:20,828 --> 00:35:22,036
Now up against the wall.

430
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:25,623
-What... What is this?
-Up against the wall!

431
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:30,962
Officer?

432
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:39,637
Well, looks like we've found something.

433
00:35:39,722 --> 00:35:41,681
-What's that?
-A concealed weapon.

434
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:45,393
-Where?
-Right here.

435
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:55,153
Now, the only question is,

436
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,577
will he actually use it?

437
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:20,386
Please don't be mad. Harry and
the boys just thought you might like me.

438
00:36:28,354 --> 00:36:31,064
Here we are for summer speed weeks
in Daytona Beach, Florida.

439
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:32,940
lt's the Firecracker 400.

440
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:35,777
And the favorite here today
is newcomer Cole Trickle

441
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:38,613
in the number 46 Superflo Chevrolet.

442
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:41,032
He's the hottest young fookie
in NASCAR history

443
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:44,952
and has won an unprecedented
five out of his last six races.

444
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:03,388
Stop playing peek-a-boo
in Rowdy's rearview mirror.

445
00:37:03,472 --> 00:37:05,473
l thought you boys would've
had enough of that by now.

446
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:14,482
-l'm not doing anything like that, Harry.
-Well, then what are you doing?

447
00:37:18,112 --> 00:37:19,987
He rubbed me the wrong way
and loosened his bumper!

448
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:21,781
l'm just gonna
have to come all the way out.

449
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:24,492
Try that and his rear bumper's liable
to go through the radiator

450
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,119
and take you out
of the whole damn race.

451
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:30,790
That bumper gets any looser, Rowdy,
they're gonna black-flag you.

452
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:31,874
Let him go by.

453
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:36,671
He's waving me by,
l'm gonna take him on the high side.

454
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:58,526
What are you so worried about, Harry?

455
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:03,906
Well, you surely got my attention.
Great driving, great recovery, Cole.

456
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:15,585
Cole Trickle now right behind
the number 51 car of Burns,

457
00:38:15,669 --> 00:38:17,712
and they go at it again.

458
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:29,223
There's a crash
coming out of turn four, Cole.

459
00:38:35,272 --> 00:38:36,689
l see it!

460
00:39:08,222 --> 00:39:09,263
Can you hear me?

461
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:11,516
-l can't see anything.
-Wiggle your fingers for me.

462
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,434
Wiggle your toes.

463
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,937
l can't see anything.

464
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,108
l'm all right. Take this off.

465
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:24,320
Hey, what do we got?

466
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:26,364
Hook up the other monitor.

467
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:30,201
l'm not a car battery.
l don't need recharging.

468
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:32,119
Relax, it's just standard procedure.

469
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:35,748
-Hey, you go screw yourself, okay?
-What was that, Mr. Burns?

470
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:38,292
l wouldn't tell you to do that, Doc.

471
00:39:40,796 --> 00:39:42,547
-What's going on?
-Keep your head down.

472
00:39:42,631 --> 00:39:43,798
Relax.

473
00:39:46,635 --> 00:39:47,718
l can't see.

474
00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:50,221
God, tell me what's going on!
l'm blind, God damn it!

475
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:52,265
-What's your name?
-What...

476
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:54,392
-What's your name?
-Cole. Cole.

477
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:57,770
Cole, would you help us out
and lie still, please?

478
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:01,774
-C-spine and CAT scan, right away.
-Yes, Doctor.

479
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:03,150
Can you move your fingers for me?

480
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:12,535
Just tell him he's had a concussion.

481
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:15,496
His brain is bruised,
and like any bruise, it's gonna swell.

482
00:40:15,581 --> 00:40:18,958
Now that swelling is almost certainly
what's affecting his vision.

483
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:22,086
You have a concussion
and your brain is bruised

484
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:25,089
and it's going to swell.
lt's certainly gonna affect your vision.

485
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:26,424
You mean this will go away?

486
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:30,261
Tell him we're gonna run some tests
to confirm everything.

487
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:33,681
What did his helmet look like
and was it cracked?

488
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:35,933
No.

489
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:39,478
-Was it scratched?
-Are you a brain doctor?

490
00:40:40,856 --> 00:40:43,941
Was the helmet scratched
at the front or the back?

491
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:46,736
l believe it was scratched
in the back and the front.

492
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,863
Are you a brain doctor?

493
00:40:49,698 --> 00:40:51,824
Could someone talk to me?

494
00:40:55,662 --> 00:41:00,458
When l'm driving, l got a guy on the
radio who talks to me. l can't see him.

495
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:02,376
But he talks to me.

496
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:07,173
Don't worry,
we're going to take care of him.

497
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:38,871
Harry.

498
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:43,292
-Are you okay, Harry?
-Yeah. Why?

499
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:51,008
You look all bent out of shape.

500
00:41:54,763 --> 00:42:00,810
-Hell, it's probably just my eyes.
-No, it's me, l've been here all night.

501
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:04,146
Jesus. What are they giving me here?

502
00:42:05,941 --> 00:42:07,817
Harry, what happened?

503
00:42:09,528 --> 00:42:12,154
Rowdy was spinning across the track.

504
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:16,951
The rule is you go straight for them.

505
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,621
So l never took my foot off the gas.

506
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:29,547
He should have been gone by the time
l got there, man, but he wasn't.

507
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:34,677
l think another car hit you
and knocked you into Rowdy.

508
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:38,431
-He came out of nowhere.
-Yeah.

509
00:42:38,515 --> 00:42:42,101
lt's one of those things
that never happens.

510
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:45,062
l wouldn't even think about it, you know.

511
00:42:46,982 --> 00:42:49,817
-l'll get the doctor.
-l feel great.

512
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:07,793
Cole.

513
00:43:11,006 --> 00:43:13,174
Damn nice to see you, Cole.

514
00:43:14,551 --> 00:43:15,551
How you doing, buddy?

515
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:18,220
lt's damn nice to see you, Buck.

516
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:20,389
How you doing?

517
00:43:22,142 --> 00:43:24,518
Cole, you've met Dr. Lewicki.

518
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:30,941
That's your doctor, Dr. Lewicki.

519
00:43:31,026 --> 00:43:33,569
l don't think
he's actually seen me before.

520
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:35,154
Sure, Harry.

521
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:39,241
-No...
-Dr. Lewicki.

522
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:46,040
Smock, stethoscope.
lt's a great costume, Harry.

523
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:50,961
-So how are you, Doc?
-No, Cole, this really is Dr. Lewicki.

524
00:43:51,046 --> 00:43:53,130
l was just about to go off duty.

525
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,883
You thought you'd come by
to look me over.

526
00:43:55,967 --> 00:44:00,012
Well, it's not a bad idea.
l figure your vision's restored?

527
00:44:00,722 --> 00:44:02,139
l think so.

528
00:44:02,224 --> 00:44:04,642
Nothing's blurred?
You're not seeing double?

529
00:44:04,726 --> 00:44:08,229
No haloes around objects?
Flashing lights?

530
00:44:09,606 --> 00:44:14,026
-What are you going to do with this?
-Look into your eyes.

531
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:17,112
Doc, Doc.

532
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:22,618
lsn't this what you're really looking for?

533
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:30,751
Well, that's interesting enough,
Mr. Trickle, but it's just not my specialty.

534
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:44,640
She's the real thing?

535
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:48,561
Well, l wouldn't play no joke on you
in a situation like this.

536
00:44:48,937 --> 00:44:51,605
Sorry, Cole, l'm trying not to smile.

537
00:44:52,107 --> 00:44:53,941
All right, get out.

538
00:44:55,569 --> 00:44:57,027
Get out. Get out of here.

539
00:44:57,112 --> 00:44:58,821
Get some rest, man.

540
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:05,536
l am not well.

541
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:09,123
l can walk, God damn it.

542
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:12,376
Not as long
as you're in this hospital you can't.

543
00:45:15,672 --> 00:45:18,340
l don't want to be next to this clown.
You mind picking up the pace a little?

544
00:45:18,425 --> 00:45:22,261
Hey, man, if you want drugs,
you have to see the nurse. Okay?

545
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:44,950
Wait!

546
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:01,216
Get out of the way.

547
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:12,853
Good morning, gentlemen.
Right this way.

548
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,944
So, neither Mr. Burns,
nor in this case, Mr. Trickle

549
00:46:20,028 --> 00:46:22,279
present any
significant intracranial injury.

550
00:46:22,364 --> 00:46:25,032
Now hold it, Doc.
Let's have that one in English.

551
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:27,117
Did they mess up their squash or not?

552
00:46:27,202 --> 00:46:31,413
Their brains are intact. As much as
they were before the accident anyway.

553
00:46:31,498 --> 00:46:33,624
You're willing to give them clearance
to get back on a racetrack?

554
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:36,335
Well, that's obviously
a dangerous way to spend your time.

555
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:39,922
That's a philosophical objection, Doc,
and l'm looking for a medical one.

556
00:46:40,006 --> 00:46:42,383
l'm not inclined to give them clearance
at this time.

557
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:46,220
-That's total horseshit.
-Gentlemen, please.

558
00:46:47,764 --> 00:46:50,557
l think they're saying
they would like another opinion.

559
00:46:50,642 --> 00:46:52,643
We would like to talk to your boss.

560
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:56,313
You're welcome to, of course,
but Dr. Wilhaire and l have consulted

561
00:46:56,398 --> 00:46:58,440
and we're of the same opinion.

562
00:46:58,525 --> 00:47:01,318
Which is a re-evaluation
in a week or two.

563
00:47:01,403 --> 00:47:02,444
Thank you, Doc.

564
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:04,446
Now, we have a little something
we have to say to the boys here

565
00:47:04,531 --> 00:47:06,615
and l don't think you
necessarily need to hear it.

566
00:47:13,707 --> 00:47:15,916
Okay, Big John's turn.

567
00:47:22,424 --> 00:47:24,883
lf you wanna turn yourselves
into a greasy spot

568
00:47:24,968 --> 00:47:27,761
on a country road somewhere,
go right ahead.

569
00:47:27,846 --> 00:47:29,722
l don't give a shit
and l don't think anybody else does,

570
00:47:29,806 --> 00:47:31,765
regardless of what they say to your face.

571
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:35,561
But you two monkeys are not going to
do it on my racetrack.

572
00:47:36,855 --> 00:47:39,606
Have you all heard
of Japanese inspection?

573
00:47:40,442 --> 00:47:42,067
Japanese inspection.

574
00:47:42,152 --> 00:47:43,986
You see, when the Japs
get in a load of lettuce

575
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:46,697
that they're not sure
they want to let in the country,

576
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:51,452
why, they just let it sit on the docks until
they get good and ready to look at it.

577
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:56,123
By then of course, it's all gone rotten.
Ain't nothing left to inspect.

578
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:59,877
ln other words,
lettuce is a perishable item

579
00:48:01,129 --> 00:48:02,963
like you two monkeys.

580
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:06,008
You trade paint one more time,
you so much as touch,

581
00:48:06,092 --> 00:48:08,135
l'm gonna black-flag the two of you.

582
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:11,138
Gonna take apart your racecar
for 300 laps.

583
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:12,556
Then if you pass the inspection,

584
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:17,102
and you put your car back together,
l might let you get back in the race.

585
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:20,189
Now, just to show us
there's no hard feelings,

586
00:48:20,273 --> 00:48:22,733
we're all gonna go out
to dinner together.

587
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:25,360
-l've got other plans.
-Yeah, and so do l.

588
00:48:25,445 --> 00:48:27,780
Well, you're gonna
have to change them.

589
00:48:27,864 --> 00:48:31,533
And not only that, you two are gonna
drive to dinner together.

590
00:48:39,501 --> 00:48:41,001
Dr. Lewicki.

591
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:44,213
l want to apologize
for what happened with Cole

592
00:48:44,297 --> 00:48:46,965
when you come into the hospital room.

593
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:50,177
Mr. Hogge, please,
it's nothing to worry about.

594
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:52,846
And in any case
it was hardly your doing.

595
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:54,807
Well, that's just it, l believe it was.

596
00:48:54,891 --> 00:48:58,268
You see, not too long ago
after he won Darlington,

597
00:48:58,353 --> 00:49:00,395
we played a trick on Cole.

598
00:49:00,939 --> 00:49:05,025
We dressed up a pretty girl
in a highway-patrol uniform.

599
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:10,948
Anyway, we told her to get real ornery
with him and she did.

600
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:14,576
-By ornery, you mean...
-l mean, real ornery.

601
00:49:17,163 --> 00:49:19,957
Why would you want me
to know about this?

602
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:23,168
l don't want you to hold
a bad opinion of Cole.

603
00:49:23,253 --> 00:49:25,295
l believe it scares him.

604
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:29,591
He needs reassurance
from you that he's okay.

605
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:33,720
After all, you're his doctor.

606
00:49:38,518 --> 00:49:39,852
That's it.

607
00:50:00,081 --> 00:50:01,248
Doc.

608
00:50:02,792 --> 00:50:06,086
l heard you thought
l was a highway-patrol officer.

609
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:11,175
l also want to thank you
for taking care of me.

610
00:50:11,259 --> 00:50:12,801
lt's my job.

611
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:15,429
lt's my life.

612
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:19,766
Well, this time let's shake hands.

613
00:50:19,851 --> 00:50:22,811
-Of course. Of course.
-Good luck, Cole.

614
00:50:31,738 --> 00:50:36,658
-Dr. Lewicki, could l see you?
-You will, l promise.

615
00:50:37,202 --> 00:50:41,914
No, l mean, have some dinner,
go catch a movie. l'll take you to a race.

616
00:50:42,457 --> 00:50:44,666
That's very sweet, really,

617
00:50:44,751 --> 00:50:47,544
but it won't get you back
on the track any faster.

618
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:52,883
No, it's not what l meant.

619
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:19,826
-You got me here, now what?
-Here's how l see this deal.

620
00:51:19,911 --> 00:51:23,247
Since you agree l ain't gonna
let you drive this car to dinner

621
00:51:23,331 --> 00:51:25,916
and l agree you ain't gonna
let me drive this car to dinner,

622
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,918
there's only one way to settle this.

623
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:30,170
What are you talking about?

624
00:51:35,093 --> 00:51:36,635
Absolutely.

625
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:19,386
Let me tell you something, Tim.

626
00:52:20,555 --> 00:52:23,682
lf you can't control your race drivers
any better than this,

627
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,395
you might consider
sticking to something you can control.

628
00:52:31,107 --> 00:52:33,734
Like used cars in downtown Charlotte.

629
00:52:56,299 --> 00:52:59,384
-Too close to call?
-Yeah.

630
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:15,609
-You're late.
-We had car trouble.

631
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:18,612
What kind of car trouble?

632
00:53:19,197 --> 00:53:22,783
l believe it was the radiator.
Wasn't it, Cole?

633
00:53:23,743 --> 00:53:25,952
Yes, Rowdy, l believe it was.

634
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:37,214
Tim, do you know anybody
at Daytona Memorial?

635
00:53:37,298 --> 00:53:40,050
-The chief of staff. Why?
-ls he a race fan?

636
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:41,385
He was born in the South.

637
00:53:41,469 --> 00:53:43,512
Tim wanted you to meet Russ Wheeler.

638
00:53:43,596 --> 00:53:46,723
He's gonna be driving for us
till you get your medical clearance.

639
00:53:46,808 --> 00:53:49,142
lt's a real pleasure to race your car,
Mr. Trickle.

640
00:53:49,227 --> 00:53:50,811
Yeah, thanks for helping out.

641
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:55,774
Yeah, Tim, l need a home address
of a doctor...

642
00:53:55,858 --> 00:54:00,070
l'm only sorry l won't be able to drive it
nearly as good as you though.

643
00:54:02,115 --> 00:54:04,157
l'll see you later, Harry.

644
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:07,494
Yeah, the doctor that...

645
00:54:09,664 --> 00:54:10,872
That...

646
00:54:13,835 --> 00:54:15,001
What?

647
00:54:32,645 --> 00:54:35,272
l was desperate to get your attention.

648
00:54:37,108 --> 00:54:39,943
Well, you got it. l walked into a jungle.

649
00:54:41,362 --> 00:54:47,200
No, it's nicely extravagant, but really,
l can't. l'm a doctor on call.

650
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:51,413
And l'm a patient. Somebody has to
re-examine me. l need clearance.

651
00:54:51,706 --> 00:54:53,290
Come up here and do that.
l'll take you to a race.

652
00:54:53,374 --> 00:54:56,460
Come on, l don't want to watch you guys
going round and round in circles,

653
00:54:56,544 --> 00:54:59,504
chasing each other like a pack of dogs
on my day off.

654
00:54:59,589 --> 00:55:02,299
Then how about chasing me
on your day off?

655
00:55:02,383 --> 00:55:05,802
l don't have a day off.
l'm on call 24 hours.

656
00:55:05,887 --> 00:55:09,681
Okay, Doctor, let's suppose
you had a couple of days off...

657
00:55:09,765 --> 00:55:11,641
Sugar. Sugar.

658
00:55:11,726 --> 00:55:13,685
...with nothing else to do.

659
00:55:13,769 --> 00:55:17,647
Could l interest you
in the North Carolina countryside?

660
00:55:17,899 --> 00:55:21,318
-Speaking theoretically?
-Speaking theoretically.

661
00:55:21,402 --> 00:55:24,654
Maybe.
But you'd have to convince my boss.

662
00:55:24,739 --> 00:55:28,658
Good. Good. How tall are you?

663
00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:46,343
What did he say?

664
00:55:46,427 --> 00:55:49,763
"Doctor, fly to Charlotte
and check those boys out."

665
00:55:53,434 --> 00:55:56,353
Boy, you're very quick.

666
00:55:57,939 --> 00:56:00,023
You ought to see me drive.

667
00:56:04,445 --> 00:56:05,529
Rowdy's not here.

668
00:56:05,613 --> 00:56:09,032
Well, l told him to meet us at the infield
by 5:00.

669
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:12,536
Well, we should probably get started
on Cole.

670
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:19,793
Close your eyes. Palms up.

671
00:56:22,088 --> 00:56:25,298
Open your eyes. Arms down.

672
00:56:26,676 --> 00:56:28,343
Follow my finger.

673
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:47,320
Stand with your feet together
and close your eyes.

674
00:56:50,825 --> 00:56:55,161
Walk one foot in front of the other.
Open your eyes.

675
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:58,665
And back on the table.

676
00:57:06,465 --> 00:57:08,008
This is tough.

677
00:57:08,509 --> 00:57:11,136
-Examinations always are.
-Why's that?

678
00:57:11,721 --> 00:57:15,599
Because l'm looking you over
and l might not like what l see.

679
00:57:15,683 --> 00:57:19,644
That has to worry you.
Pick a spot on the wall and look at it.

680
00:57:25,026 --> 00:57:27,444
-Please, don't move. Your eyes.
-l didn't move.

681
00:57:27,528 --> 00:57:29,446
Just focus on one spot.

682
00:57:39,707 --> 00:57:43,126
-What do you see?
-The retina.

683
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:46,546
What does it look like?

684
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:51,885
Very pretty, actually.

685
00:57:59,477 --> 00:58:01,561
-Seen enough?
-Just about.

686
00:58:05,066 --> 00:58:08,902
-What did you do that for?
-lt's the Babinski sign.

687
00:58:10,279 --> 00:58:12,656
lf the toe goes up, you're in trouble.

688
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:16,368
You're fine. Put on your clothes.
You're cleared to race.

689
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:37,263
l'm sorry, it just drove me nuts in there.

690
00:58:39,892 --> 00:58:43,603
-How could you ignore me like that?
-l wasn't ignoring you!

691
00:58:50,903 --> 00:58:54,656
l wasn't ignoring you.
l gave you a very thorough physical.

692
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:05,625
You're not gonna do anything weird
on my leg, are you, Cole?

693
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:06,793
No.

694
00:59:07,586 --> 00:59:10,755
lt's just something Harry and l
work on together.

695
00:59:11,132 --> 00:59:13,049
lt's called drafting.

696
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:19,514
One car tucks in behind another.
Two cars can go faster than one.

697
00:59:20,141 --> 00:59:22,392
They divide the air resistance
between them.

698
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:24,686
Now, here's where it gets interesting.

699
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:28,481
The lead car has to floor it
to hit 200 miles an hour.

700
00:59:28,566 --> 00:59:31,109
But the car that's stuck behind doesn't.

701
00:59:31,193 --> 00:59:34,696
He can go just as fast
and still have power in reserve.

702
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:38,950
So, when these two cars
come off that last turn,

703
00:59:39,243 --> 00:59:42,454
the car that's in back
can move out of the draft,

704
00:59:42,538 --> 00:59:46,332
and slingshot past the lead car,
beat it to the finish line.

705
00:59:49,962 --> 00:59:52,589
And he goes straight to Victory Lane.

706
00:59:54,341 --> 00:59:59,262
-You and Harry work on that, huh?
-More or less.

707
01:00:00,598 --> 01:00:05,518
Yeah, right. ls there anything
you want to do besides racing?

708
01:00:10,858 --> 01:00:12,525
Anything you say.

709
01:00:13,444 --> 01:00:19,115
Cole, there must be something else
that you want to do in life, eventually.

710
01:00:23,704 --> 01:00:27,791
l can tell you what l don't want to be
in life, that's a fraud.

711
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:33,880
l want to know it's not just dumb luck
that gets me around that racetrack.

712
01:00:35,883 --> 01:00:38,885
But that's not the question
you're really asking.

713
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:41,262
What's the question l'm really asking?

714
01:00:41,347 --> 01:00:45,266
-"How can l be in bed with this guy?"
-l know the answer to that one.

715
01:00:45,351 --> 01:00:48,144
Maybe, but you're still asking it.

716
01:00:48,229 --> 01:00:51,147
"How could l, a brilliant brain doctor,

717
01:00:51,232 --> 01:00:54,609
"be in bed with a guy
who drives a car for a living?"

718
01:00:57,404 --> 01:01:00,198
What's your response to that,
by the way?

719
01:01:02,701 --> 01:01:07,038
Do something to make me respect you.
Do it.

720
01:01:07,122 --> 01:01:09,999
Tell me what you love
so much about racing.

721
01:01:11,669 --> 01:01:13,044
The speed.

722
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:17,215
To be able to control it.

723
01:01:17,883 --> 01:01:21,594
To know that l can control something
that's out of control.

724
01:01:24,974 --> 01:01:27,141
l'd really have to show you.

725
01:01:29,603 --> 01:01:30,895
Show me.

726
01:01:53,711 --> 01:01:57,463
lt's funny about this place.
When l grew up, l hated farming.

727
01:01:57,548 --> 01:02:02,051
All l wanted to do was work
on racecars. Got into racing.

728
01:02:02,136 --> 01:02:05,471
Now all l want to do is to make
enough money to work on a farm.

729
01:02:05,556 --> 01:02:07,348
Hi, Claire, l'm Jennie. Nice to meet you.

730
01:02:07,433 --> 01:02:08,683
Hi, nice to meet you.

731
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:10,351
-Hi, Cole.
-Hey, Jennie.

732
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:20,111
Just beyond the top of that knoll, we're
going to build our permanent home.

733
01:02:20,195 --> 01:02:23,031
-Costs much to build up there?
-About $1 0 million.

734
01:02:23,115 --> 01:02:24,115
Oh, Rowdy.

735
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:28,161
Jennie's gonna do the building.
She's designing the house.

736
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:31,080
We just want a place
that nobody's ever lived in but us.

737
01:02:31,165 --> 01:02:33,166
lsn't that right, honey?

738
01:02:35,169 --> 01:02:38,254
-Rowdy, what is it?
-l think l'm getting seasick.

739
01:02:38,339 --> 01:02:40,298
Seasick? You've never been seasick
a day in your life.

740
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:48,306
You didn't forget about the physical,
did you?

741
01:02:49,016 --> 01:02:52,685
Nobody in my family goes to a doctor
unless they're dying.

742
01:02:53,729 --> 01:02:56,230
Just 'cause you ain't feeling good, shit.

743
01:02:56,315 --> 01:02:58,566
Stand with your feet together.

744
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:03,363
Put your arms out.

745
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:06,741
Close your eyes.

746
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:16,626
Take it easy. Take it easy.

747
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:19,212
-l'm fine. l'm fine.
-Yeah, l've got you.

748
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:21,923
-l'm fine. l'm fine.
-All right.

749
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:32,475
We've got to get you back to Daytona.

750
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:35,770
Bill Wilhaire, the head of neurosurgery,
is my boss.

751
01:03:35,896 --> 01:03:37,939
He's as good as they come.

752
01:03:41,402 --> 01:03:45,571
-Did you get sick in there?
-No.

753
01:03:46,031 --> 01:03:47,907
-He did, he got sick.
-Rowdy.

754
01:03:47,992 --> 01:03:53,079
You're one hell of a candy-ass.
l faint and you throw up.

755
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:55,665
Rowdy, it's imperative that you get back
to Daytona Memorial

756
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:57,583
and see Dr. Wilhaire.

757
01:04:13,267 --> 01:04:15,810
The report on the birth
of another new Winston Cup team.

758
01:04:15,894 --> 01:04:18,229
Behind me, the bright orange
and blue colors of Hardee's

759
01:04:18,313 --> 01:04:21,357
adorn this Chevfolet. Who's the driver?
awell, to no one's surprise,

760
01:04:21,442 --> 01:04:23,651
it's Russ Wheeler,
the young man who subbed so superbly

761
01:04:23,736 --> 01:04:25,653
just weeks ago
for the injured Cole Trickle.

762
01:04:25,738 --> 01:04:26,863
Listen to this horseshit.

763
01:04:26,947 --> 01:04:30,867
Nowjoined by car owner, Tim Daland.
Now, Tim, my question now is,

764
01:04:30,951 --> 01:04:32,910
you've got two competitive spirits here,

765
01:04:32,995 --> 01:04:35,455
and will these competitive spirits
cause you a conflict?

766
01:04:35,539 --> 01:04:38,041
awell, of course, Jerry,
we believe that we can

767
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:41,294
maintain the integrity and the
independence of these two race teams,

768
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:42,879
otherwise, we wouldn't be doing it.

769
01:04:42,963 --> 01:04:45,923
Who will you be rooting for
come Sunday, Tim?

770
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:50,053
awell, l tell you, Jerry, l'll even
wave to him every time l lap him.

771
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:59,020
These new tires are terrible.
You should have put on scuffs.

772
01:04:59,104 --> 01:05:00,146
You're doing good, Cole.

773
01:05:00,981 --> 01:05:02,482
l'm too loose.

774
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,822
The carjust feels all wrong.

775
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:13,659
-What's wrong?
-Cole's upset.

776
01:05:13,744 --> 01:05:16,579
-What about?
-About being in that racecar.

777
01:05:21,293 --> 01:05:27,048
Wheelerjust passed the eighth car.
He's coming up on your inside.

778
01:05:36,183 --> 01:05:37,183
Jesus!

779
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:11,968
-What happened?
-The engine blew.

780
01:06:12,052 --> 01:06:14,554
-How?
-l'm not a mechanic, Harry.

781
01:06:30,571 --> 01:06:33,698
Claire, l'm in Georgia today.
Rowdy's in North Carolina.

782
01:06:33,782 --> 01:06:36,033
Well, somebody better talk him
into coming down here.

783
01:06:36,118 --> 01:06:38,870
Claire, we've got a trauma in the ER.

784
01:06:38,954 --> 01:06:40,830
He's almost certainly hemorrhaging.
The longer he ignores it,

785
01:06:40,914 --> 01:06:43,207
the more damage is gonna be done
to his brain.

786
01:06:43,292 --> 01:06:45,209
He's your friend, Cole.

787
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:48,337
-Where's Cole?
-He's on the phone.

788
01:06:50,591 --> 01:06:52,842
He could use a little privacy.

789
01:06:58,432 --> 01:06:59,473
What's wrong with him?

790
01:06:59,558 --> 01:07:01,809
l'll tell you what's wrong in this deal,
it's you, Tim.

791
01:07:01,894 --> 01:07:04,228
You're a victim
of your own goddamn creation.

792
01:07:04,313 --> 01:07:07,857
Two race teams! That's one too many
roosters in the hen house.

793
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:09,400
lt doesn't seem to bother
Russ Wheeler.

794
01:07:09,484 --> 01:07:11,736
Oh, no, no, no.
Ever since that Daytona crash,

795
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:13,446
Cole's been called a troublemaker.

796
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:16,699
Wheeler figures he can bump
and bam Cole all he wants.

797
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:18,701
l don't see Russ
doing anything like that,

798
01:07:18,785 --> 01:07:20,703
NASCAR doesn't see Russ
doing anything like that.

799
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:22,538
l guess it ain't happening then,

800
01:07:22,623 --> 01:07:26,042
under the watchful eyes of experts
like you and NASCAR.

801
01:07:26,126 --> 01:07:28,294
l tell you what is happening.

802
01:07:28,879 --> 01:07:32,089
Cole's not running good,
he's not looking good,

803
01:07:32,174 --> 01:07:33,758
and now he's got sponsor trouble.

804
01:07:33,842 --> 01:07:36,469
-But you don't, is that it?
-As far as that goes, no, l don't.

805
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:39,013
But l want to keep the sponsor
and Cole.

806
01:07:39,097 --> 01:07:40,598
He's the one that really
made this happen for us

807
01:07:40,682 --> 01:07:42,141
and l haven't forgotten that, Harry.

808
01:07:42,226 --> 01:07:43,976
Right. Right.

809
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:52,777
You on the phone with the doc?
Fighting?

810
01:07:54,112 --> 01:07:56,656
She's too busy to talk right now.

811
01:07:57,741 --> 01:07:59,075
Here's your owner, Tim Daland.

812
01:07:59,159 --> 01:08:00,952
What do you think
about this young man, Tim?

813
01:08:01,036 --> 01:08:05,289
l think Russ ran a great race today.
l'm really, really very pleased.

814
01:08:06,083 --> 01:08:07,750
One hundred and two laps complete,

815
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:09,919
but we're under caution here
at North Wilkesbofo.

816
01:08:10,671 --> 01:08:12,797
How come Cole hasn't seen Rowdy yet?

817
01:08:12,881 --> 01:08:15,299
Cole's no different from any other driver.

818
01:08:15,384 --> 01:08:17,093
What do you mean he's no different?

819
01:08:17,177 --> 01:08:21,097
Well, l mean, of course
Cole doesn't want to see Rowdy.

820
01:08:21,181 --> 01:08:24,308
Drivers can't stand to be reminded of
what can happen to them in a racecar.

821
01:08:24,393 --> 01:08:27,103
They don't go to hospitals,
they don't go to funerals.

822
01:08:27,187 --> 01:08:30,439
You get a driver to a funeral
before he's actually dead,

823
01:08:30,524 --> 01:08:32,400
you made history, Doc.

824
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:58,718
-He's blocking me.
-That's right.

825
01:09:01,388 --> 01:09:03,389
Move the son of a bitch!

826
01:09:57,694 --> 01:09:59,487
Son of a bitch!

827
01:09:59,571 --> 01:10:04,116
Trickle moving to the bottom of the
track with both right-side tires flat.

828
01:10:05,369 --> 01:10:08,996
Russ Wheeler
takes the checkered flag...

829
01:10:14,836 --> 01:10:16,879
Russ Wheeler don't deserve to win,
Tim.

830
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:20,383
lf NASCAR won't call it lowdown,
shit-assed racing, you better.

831
01:10:20,467 --> 01:10:21,801
-lt's just racing, Harry.
-Oh, yeah?

832
01:10:21,885 --> 01:10:23,719
-Cole overreacted. Yeah.
-Oh, yeah?

833
01:10:31,395 --> 01:10:32,603
Change my tires.

834
01:10:32,687 --> 01:10:36,607
-l don't know what for, Cole. lt's over.
-Change my tires.

835
01:11:09,349 --> 01:11:13,727
There seems to be a little post-race
activityjust outside the pit lane.

836
01:11:13,812 --> 01:11:15,104
You shit!

837
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:23,028
He's destroyed both my cars.
He's destroyed both my cars!

838
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:26,449
He's fired! You're fired!

839
01:11:26,533 --> 01:11:28,534
You're all fired. You hear me?

840
01:11:42,757 --> 01:11:46,093
Are you going to get your bags,
head off to Daytona?

841
01:11:46,178 --> 01:11:48,762
Where are you going from here?

842
01:11:48,847 --> 01:11:52,433
l'll take you to the airport,
drop off the rental car,

843
01:11:52,517 --> 01:11:54,560
catch a flight to Charlotte.

844
01:11:57,105 --> 01:11:59,398
You want me to come with you?

845
01:12:01,526 --> 01:12:04,403
You don't have to go back
to the hospital?

846
01:12:04,488 --> 01:12:08,657
-We could also try to see Rowdy.
-Yeah.

847
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:15,331
-ls there anything wrong with that?
-Of course not.

848
01:12:16,917 --> 01:12:20,336
-l guess l just forgot about that.
-Yeah, l know.

849
01:12:25,759 --> 01:12:26,884
Cole!

850
01:12:34,893 --> 01:12:35,976
Let me out of the car, Cole.

851
01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:41,941
Let me out of the car, Cole.
Let me out of the car.

852
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:50,282
Let me out of the car!
Let me out or l'm getting out.

853
01:12:51,243 --> 01:12:52,701
Hey! Hey, hey!

854
01:12:54,329 --> 01:12:57,873
Claire! Wait. Just wait.

855
01:12:57,958 --> 01:12:59,667
-Get away or l'll call the police.
-You'll what?

856
01:12:59,751 --> 01:13:01,961
-You heard me.
-Okay, call the police.

857
01:13:02,045 --> 01:13:03,128
But l'm not leaving until you talk.

858
01:13:03,213 --> 01:13:04,838
-l've got nothing to say.
-Well, l do!

859
01:13:04,923 --> 01:13:07,132
Okay, great. Let's hear it.

860
01:13:10,679 --> 01:13:12,763
-That's it? Fine.
-Just...

861
01:13:12,847 --> 01:13:15,891
You shouldn't be driving a car anyway.
Not on a road, not on a racetrack,

862
01:13:15,976 --> 01:13:17,184
and not in a parking lot.

863
01:13:17,269 --> 01:13:20,646
You're selfish, you're crazy
and you're scared.

864
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:22,940
-l'm not scared.
-You are scared to death.

865
01:13:23,024 --> 01:13:25,484
You and Rowdy, you have
the same sickness. lt's called denial.

866
01:13:25,569 --> 01:13:28,404
And it's probably going to kill you both.

867
01:13:33,243 --> 01:13:34,827
You want to control something
that's out of control,

868
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:37,246
that's what you said to me, wasn't it?

869
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:38,581
l'm going to let you in on a little secret

870
01:13:38,665 --> 01:13:41,584
that almost everybody else in this world
automatically knows.

871
01:13:41,668 --> 01:13:44,378
Control is an illusion,
you infantile egomaniac.

872
01:13:44,462 --> 01:13:46,922
Nobody knows
what's gonna happen next.

873
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:50,009
Not on a freeway, not in an airplane,
not inside our own bodies,

874
01:13:50,093 --> 01:13:54,096
and certainly not on a racetrack
with 40 other infantile egomaniacs.

875
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:56,265
Nobody knows
and nobody controls anything.

876
01:13:56,349 --> 01:13:58,892
Now, you've gotten a glimpse of that
and you're scared.

877
01:13:58,977 --> 01:14:00,436
You might not have the courage
to race anymore.

878
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,605
You may never have had it.

879
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:08,319
God, l hate you for this,
you son of a bitch.

880
01:14:08,403 --> 01:14:10,779
You make me sound like a doctor.

881
01:15:05,585 --> 01:15:06,919
Jennie.

882
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,547
Why are you here?

883
01:15:13,093 --> 01:15:14,510
Where is he?

884
01:15:27,107 --> 01:15:29,566
-l hear you're out of a job.
-Yeah.

885
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:37,366
You're not looking too good.

886
01:15:39,452 --> 01:15:41,995
How many of these things
do you chew every day?

887
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:44,206
What did you come here for?

888
01:15:47,168 --> 01:15:49,336
To take you to the hospital.

889
01:15:52,716 --> 01:15:54,633
lf it had been anybody
but a damn woman doctor,

890
01:15:54,718 --> 01:15:57,678
l'd have been back on the track
weeks ago.

891
01:15:57,804 --> 01:16:00,556
-ls that right?
-Yeah, that's right.

892
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:04,393
Listen, man, l've raced
with my legs broke, heart bruised,

893
01:16:04,477 --> 01:16:07,730
eyes popping out of my head
like they're on springs.

894
01:16:08,398 --> 01:16:11,567
This is going to go away
just like anything else.

895
01:16:11,693 --> 01:16:13,694
As far as l'm concerned,
l'm going to live forever,

896
01:16:13,778 --> 01:16:16,196
unless l go to some damn hospital
where they

897
01:16:16,281 --> 01:16:20,826
take your shoes off, and make you shut
your eyes, and bang, you're dead.

898
01:16:21,953 --> 01:16:23,996
What did you win this for?

899
01:16:24,831 --> 01:16:27,958
This one right here.
What did you win this for?

900
01:16:29,502 --> 01:16:31,295
Doesn't it say?

901
01:16:31,421 --> 01:16:35,716
Yeah, it's the Winston Cup, buddy.
Well, hell, that's an easy one to forget.

902
01:16:35,842 --> 01:16:39,261
What's your name?
Or has that slipped your mind, too?

903
01:16:42,724 --> 01:16:45,184
-Screw you, man.
-Okay.

904
01:16:46,102 --> 01:16:49,104
We can go down there and fix your head
or we can fix it right here!

905
01:16:49,189 --> 01:16:51,190
Now, what's it gonna be?

906
01:16:57,071 --> 01:16:59,239
Rowdy would like to see you.

907
01:17:05,705 --> 01:17:07,790
-How is he?
-He's okay.

908
01:17:09,042 --> 01:17:11,126
-How are you?
-Good.

909
01:17:12,879 --> 01:17:15,297
Think he'll make Daytona?
lt's not for a few months.

910
01:17:15,381 --> 01:17:20,385
l think he'll make it out of the hospital.
But he'll never drive a racecar again.

911
01:17:27,602 --> 01:17:31,230
Cole, this is Dr. Wilhaire.
He's going to be doing the surgery.

912
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:33,232
-Cole Trickle.
-Cole.

913
01:17:34,192 --> 01:17:35,734
So, how is he?

914
01:17:36,736 --> 01:17:40,197
Well, the doc here says
l need minor brain surgery.

915
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:41,949
Well, that's not exactly how l put it.

916
01:17:42,033 --> 01:17:46,078
Well, listen, Doc, any surgery
on his brain is bound to be minor.

917
01:17:47,914 --> 01:17:50,165
You all mind if l talk to this guy
a second?

918
01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:51,625
Of course.

919
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:06,348
They say l got a busted blood vessel
in my brain.

920
01:18:06,432 --> 01:18:10,936
So, they want to drill a hole in my head
and get rid of the leaky blood.

921
01:18:12,438 --> 01:18:15,274
You think l should let them do it, Cole?

922
01:18:16,276 --> 01:18:17,568
Yeah.

923
01:18:17,652 --> 01:18:21,321
-You'd let them if it was you?
-l would.

924
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:25,534
Okay, then l've got to ask you to do
something for me.

925
01:18:26,578 --> 01:18:28,078
Well, name it.

926
01:18:28,162 --> 01:18:32,040
-Drive my car.
-What are you talking about?

927
01:18:32,125 --> 01:18:33,417
Daytona.

928
01:18:36,421 --> 01:18:38,547
No, Rowdy, you have plenty of time
to get ready for Daytona.

929
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:40,299
You don't need me.

930
01:18:42,385 --> 01:18:46,179
l lost my sponsor. They put their money
on me, not the car.

931
01:18:46,264 --> 01:18:49,933
Now, they ain't too sure
l'm going to come out of this deal.

932
01:18:50,435 --> 01:18:51,685
Are you?

933
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:59,109
l've got a lot of land
and a lot of plans l ain't paid for.

934
01:18:59,193 --> 01:19:02,779
So the only way to get my sponsor back
is to make sure

935
01:19:02,864 --> 01:19:04,406
my car runs good at Daytona.

936
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:06,992
All that network TV shit, you know.

937
01:19:08,328 --> 01:19:11,204
Well, you don't need me. There's plenty
of other drivers. You don't need me.

938
01:19:11,289 --> 01:19:14,791
Don't give me that mealy-mouthed shit,
you son of a bitch.

939
01:19:14,876 --> 01:19:17,544
l got to put a driver in my car
that'll finish in the top five,

940
01:19:17,629 --> 01:19:21,006
before my sponsors
will pick up the tab for the year.

941
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:25,719
Maybe after Daytona, maybe l can drive.

942
01:19:27,221 --> 01:19:28,430
Maybe it'll be a different driver.

943
01:19:28,514 --> 01:19:31,642
But in the meantime,
l want the best for my family.

944
01:19:31,726 --> 01:19:34,394
So don't you bullshit me, Cole.

945
01:19:34,479 --> 01:19:38,899
ls there some other reason why l ain't
good enough for you to drive for?

946
01:19:49,494 --> 01:19:51,203
Then you'll do it?

947
01:20:05,343 --> 01:20:08,428
Shit, man. You had me going.

948
01:20:10,223 --> 01:20:14,393
Now, let's get down to business here.
What's your deal with Daland?

949
01:20:17,563 --> 01:20:21,066
Hell, we'll work that out, okay?
Excuse me for a second.

950
01:20:26,364 --> 01:20:29,700
-Cole, what's wrong?
-Just tell Rowdy l'll call him.

951
01:20:47,427 --> 01:20:49,886
No, no, no, no, sir!

952
01:20:49,971 --> 01:20:53,181
Can't use them. Don't want them.
Couldn't afford them if l did.

953
01:20:53,266 --> 01:20:54,975
What the hell are you talking about?

954
01:20:55,059 --> 01:20:58,687
Racecar drivers.
l know all about you and Rowdy Burns.

955
01:20:58,771 --> 01:21:02,899
And l ain't setting up that car
for Daytona or anywhere else, Cole,

956
01:21:02,984 --> 01:21:04,776
but you're welcome to come on in.

957
01:21:04,861 --> 01:21:08,363
We'll bring out the moonshine and start
telling lies and calling up the women.

958
01:21:08,448 --> 01:21:12,534
-But no talk about racing. Come on.
-All right, no talk about racing.

959
01:21:12,618 --> 01:21:14,119
Come on, Buck,

960
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:16,580
l'll race your ass.

961
01:21:29,677 --> 01:21:32,804
l believe l'm gonna take off.
Good night, Harry.

962
01:21:46,486 --> 01:21:48,737
Why won't you set up the car?

963
01:21:53,826 --> 01:21:56,912
Ever since you and Rowdy crashed
at Daytona and Rowdy got sick,

964
01:21:56,996 --> 01:21:58,789
you've been waiting
for the other shoe to drop,

965
01:21:58,873 --> 01:22:01,708
waiting on something bad
to happen to you.

966
01:22:03,377 --> 01:22:05,337
Just like Buddy Bretherton.
He started hearing voices.

967
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:09,091
All kinds of them, everywhere.
Atlanta, Richmond, Wilkesboro.

968
01:22:09,175 --> 01:22:12,052
And all of them
only had but one thing to say,

969
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:16,264
"Get out of that racecar. Get out..."

970
01:22:22,146 --> 01:22:23,522
You pegged the engine in Atlanta,

971
01:22:23,606 --> 01:22:26,108
redlined the son of a bitch
and blew it sky-high.

972
01:22:26,192 --> 01:22:29,027
Done it deliberate. Done it deliberate.

973
01:22:30,488 --> 01:22:35,158
9,400 rpms
according to the little telltale button.

974
01:22:37,703 --> 01:22:41,581
You was worried if you didn't get out
of that car right quick, you'd die.

975
01:22:41,666 --> 01:22:43,416
Now call me a liar.

976
01:22:45,002 --> 01:22:46,711
You're not lying.

977
01:22:46,796 --> 01:22:50,549
All right. What the hell
are we talking about then?

978
01:22:50,633 --> 01:22:54,469
Racing Rowdy's car at Daytona.
l can't do it without you.

979
01:22:55,179 --> 01:22:57,097
You can't do it period.

980
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:01,893
And l ain't going back there, Cole.

981
01:23:13,239 --> 01:23:20,871
Buddy didn't really die of a heart attack,
did he?

982
01:23:20,955 --> 01:23:24,249
No, he didn't,
but you don't wanna hear about it.

983
01:23:27,628 --> 01:23:31,840
NASCAR privately claimed the setup
on the car is what killed Buddy.

984
01:23:35,595 --> 01:23:37,971
You used thin-walled tubing
to keep the weight down.

985
01:23:38,055 --> 01:23:40,223
The exhaust fumes
broke through the fire wall

986
01:23:40,308 --> 01:23:42,684
and carbon monoxide
knocked Buddy out.

987
01:23:42,810 --> 01:23:45,437
Horseshit! When Buddy hit the wall
at the third turn,

988
01:23:45,521 --> 01:23:48,523
he was jabbering on the radio
about as fast as he was driving.

989
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:51,026
Carbon monoxide, my ass.

990
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:52,903
That was the loudest-talking
unconscious man

991
01:23:52,987 --> 01:23:54,154
you ever heard in your life.

992
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:57,365
Nothing killed Buddy
but his imagination.

993
01:23:57,450 --> 01:24:00,911
Why didn't you let them investigate,
Harry? Why? Why?

994
01:24:02,538 --> 01:24:06,458
'Cause l should have known better
than to let him drive in the first place.

995
01:24:08,169 --> 01:24:10,128
You see, Buddy...

996
01:24:10,254 --> 01:24:13,215
Buddy was a terrible pain in the ass.
He really was.

997
01:24:13,299 --> 01:24:14,966
He thought he knew about cars,

998
01:24:15,051 --> 01:24:17,344
which made him twice as ignorant
as you.

999
01:24:19,263 --> 01:24:20,680
But still...

1000
01:24:27,230 --> 01:24:30,106
l look at guys like Buddy...

1001
01:24:30,191 --> 01:24:34,903
l've seen him do things in my racecar
that's absolutely unbelievable.

1002
01:24:34,987 --> 01:24:37,656
That really showed me what l had done.

1003
01:24:38,658 --> 01:24:39,699
And then you see,

1004
01:24:39,784 --> 01:24:42,827
you're gonna automatically have to
sort of love that guy.

1005
01:24:42,912 --> 01:24:45,038
Whether you want to or not.

1006
01:24:47,083 --> 01:24:48,750
Buddy Bretherton.

1007
01:24:51,254 --> 01:24:53,838
l have to ask you something, Harry.

1008
01:24:54,507 --> 01:24:59,678
Now, before Buddy hit the wall,

1009
01:24:59,762 --> 01:25:02,514
how was he actually doing in that race?

1010
01:25:03,516 --> 01:25:07,435
-You ornery, no good...
-Hey, hey...

1011
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:11,773
You set up that car. You set up the car.

1012
01:25:11,857 --> 01:25:15,902
lf you get back in that car, you'll die.
You'll die. You hear?

1013
01:25:20,241 --> 01:25:23,910
l'm not getting back in my car,
l'm getting in Rowdy's.

1014
01:25:23,995 --> 01:25:27,205
Well, l see how you're dumb enough
to be a race driver.

1015
01:25:27,290 --> 01:25:29,624
You think you'll hide from your bad luck
in his car?

1016
01:25:29,709 --> 01:25:31,751
What the hell for? For Rowdy?

1017
01:25:31,836 --> 01:25:35,088
lf he could run tomorrow,
he'd crash you to win the race!

1018
01:25:35,172 --> 01:25:36,172
He's mean.

1019
01:25:36,257 --> 01:25:40,218
-He's no particular friend, so why?
-Because he asked me to.

1020
01:25:40,303 --> 01:25:43,305
Horseshit! You just wanna race again.

1021
01:25:43,389 --> 01:25:46,391
Yeah. And so do you.

1022
01:25:46,475 --> 01:25:48,476
Well, you're scared.

1023
01:25:48,561 --> 01:25:51,980
-You're scared.
-Yeah, and so are you.

1024
01:25:54,108 --> 01:25:55,233
Yeah.

1025
01:26:05,161 --> 01:26:06,286
What?

1026
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:11,291
l need this, Harry.

1027
01:26:15,379 --> 01:26:17,547
l don't have anything else.

1028
01:26:20,092 --> 01:26:22,052
You've given me a life.

1029
01:26:26,349 --> 01:26:28,975
God damn it, l don't want to lose it.

1030
01:26:30,311 --> 01:26:32,062
Just put me in that racecar.

1031
01:26:32,146 --> 01:26:35,231
Let me be the one to show you
what you've done.

1032
01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:38,443
Just trust me.

1033
01:26:43,991 --> 01:26:48,536
Let me drive, Harry.
l won't make a fool out of you.

1034
01:26:59,715 --> 01:27:06,388
l honestly just wouldn't know
how this deal's going to turn out, Cole.

1035
01:27:06,472 --> 01:27:07,806
You know.

1036
01:27:09,683 --> 01:27:11,476
Neither do l, Harry.

1037
01:27:36,335 --> 01:27:37,710
l'm setting up for cool weather.

1038
01:27:37,795 --> 01:27:40,046
But if that sun breaks
after you're on the track,

1039
01:27:40,131 --> 01:27:42,590
you're liable to run real loose real quick.

1040
01:27:42,675 --> 01:27:45,427
l don't wanna worry you enough,
but Cole's not ready for that.

1041
01:27:45,511 --> 01:27:48,304
He's changed. See, he's changed.

1042
01:27:48,389 --> 01:27:52,434
You cannot get out of control
and expect him to bring you right back.

1043
01:27:52,518 --> 01:27:55,854
He's liable to hurt you,
you're liable to hurt him.

1044
01:27:56,689 --> 01:27:58,940
l couldn't handle that. So...

1045
01:28:00,234 --> 01:28:03,069
You've got to take care of him. All right?

1046
01:28:04,363 --> 01:28:06,698
You've got to take care of him.

1047
01:28:17,793 --> 01:28:21,379
This is not the kind of answer
l'm looking for from you.

1048
01:28:27,887 --> 01:28:30,013
Daytona is a tough racetrack.

1049
01:28:30,097 --> 01:28:32,307
And l'm sure, myself and everybody,

1050
01:28:32,391 --> 01:28:34,642
we're going to keep an eye on Cole
to see

1051
01:28:34,727 --> 01:28:36,936
if he's there, you know,
all his reflexes and everything.

1052
01:28:37,229 --> 01:28:38,730
He's plenty capable
of running that racecar good

1053
01:28:38,814 --> 01:28:40,231
and l don't think he has any kind of

1054
01:28:40,316 --> 01:28:43,318
effects from the accident that would
be a factor in the way he performs.

1055
01:28:43,402 --> 01:28:46,905
l'm glad he's well enough to come back
and l hope l beat him at the same time.

1056
01:28:47,114 --> 01:28:48,156
You know, a lot of guys don't like him.

1057
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:50,533
And it's just the situation
where the guy's got a lot of talent.

1058
01:28:50,618 --> 01:28:52,285
He's wide open,
he doesn't think about anything else,

1059
01:28:52,369 --> 01:28:54,037
he just wants to win. l like that.

1060
01:28:54,121 --> 01:28:58,291
Since the crash, he's been a danger
to himself and to other drivers.

1061
01:28:59,251 --> 01:29:02,670
But if he comes near me,
l'm going to put him in the wall.

1062
01:29:02,755 --> 01:29:04,422
Simple as that.

1063
01:29:04,798 --> 01:29:08,593
l don't expect l'll see too much of him.
Except in my rearview mirror.

1064
01:29:31,909 --> 01:29:33,201
Come in.

1065
01:29:38,791 --> 01:29:41,834
Harry said you wouldn't mind
if l stopped by.

1066
01:29:50,052 --> 01:29:54,055
-How's Rowdy?
-He's getting better every day.

1067
01:29:55,015 --> 01:29:56,391
Especially since you told him how much

1068
01:29:56,475 --> 01:29:59,769
you were looking forward
to getting in his racecar.

1069
01:30:00,145 --> 01:30:01,938
So l lied.

1070
01:30:04,650 --> 01:30:06,192
What are you thinking?

1071
01:30:06,277 --> 01:30:09,571
Just how much l'd like to know
what you're thinking.

1072
01:30:12,449 --> 01:30:14,826
l guess everybody's the same.

1073
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:18,997
You've got to be good at yourjob before
you can enjoy the rest of your life.

1074
01:30:19,081 --> 01:30:20,665
This is my job.

1075
01:30:22,001 --> 01:30:23,668
lt's all l know.

1076
01:30:31,885 --> 01:30:34,470
You know l can't watch you do this.

1077
01:30:35,347 --> 01:30:36,598
Claire.

1078
01:30:38,309 --> 01:30:44,022
l'm more afraid of being nothing
than l am of being hurt.

1079
01:30:47,401 --> 01:30:48,818
Walk me out?

1080
01:30:52,615 --> 01:30:57,910
awe welcome you to the Daytona 500,
the Super Bowl of motor racing events.

1081
01:30:57,995 --> 01:31:00,038
Certainly among the favorites
for today's race

1082
01:31:00,122 --> 01:31:04,334
has to be Russ awheeler driving the
number 18 Hardee's sponsored car.

1083
01:31:04,418 --> 01:31:06,669
He has certainly given race fans
something to talk about

1084
01:31:06,754 --> 01:31:09,881
after winning the pole for today's event.

1085
01:31:09,965 --> 01:31:11,841
But don't count out Cole Trickle,

1086
01:31:11,925 --> 01:31:14,677
who is returning to Daytona
for the first time

1087
01:31:14,762 --> 01:31:17,972
since his near-fatal accident here
last July.

1088
01:31:20,517 --> 01:31:22,810
Told me you guys didn't have a sponsor.

1089
01:31:22,895 --> 01:31:26,898
Well, they gave us just about enough
money to put their name on the car.

1090
01:31:33,572 --> 01:31:35,531
-Tim.
-Cole.

1091
01:31:46,919 --> 01:31:50,505
Why is the hood up?
What's wrong with the car?

1092
01:31:50,589 --> 01:31:52,757
Take it easy.
We had to change engines.

1093
01:31:52,841 --> 01:31:55,760
We forgot to tighten the oil line.

1094
01:31:55,844 --> 01:31:59,430
-Why did you have to change engines?
-Found some metal in the oil filter.

1095
01:32:01,350 --> 01:32:04,769
-Where did you get the engine?
-Well, we stole it.

1096
01:32:10,567 --> 01:32:13,361
Claire, put the boy in his car,

1097
01:32:13,445 --> 01:32:17,115
tell him to get out on the track
before he starts sweating, all right.

1098
01:32:34,550 --> 01:32:37,719
So, you're going to get in your car
and take off?

1099
01:32:41,765 --> 01:32:43,391
Drive carefully.

1100
01:33:14,006 --> 01:33:16,674
Gentlemen, start your engines.

1101
01:33:32,858 --> 01:33:36,694
awe are underway.
The Daytona 500 is on.

1102
01:33:45,537 --> 01:33:50,208
awe are 56 laps into this 200-lap event
and Russ Wheeler is in the lead.

1103
01:33:51,335 --> 01:33:55,671
47:01 Lead is 45:90.
You're running last.

1104
01:34:01,553 --> 01:34:03,387
What's going on, Cole?

1105
01:34:07,184 --> 01:34:08,768
Are you all right?

1106
01:34:15,776 --> 01:34:19,070
Just past the halfway mark
and Wheeler still leads.

1107
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:35,795
There's a crash at turn three,
and some oil at the bottom of the track.

1108
01:34:35,879 --> 01:34:37,755
The lead is just taken.

1109
01:34:40,217 --> 01:34:43,302
Cars are sliding down from the top
of the track, so watch yourself.

1110
01:34:45,097 --> 01:34:48,641
You'd better go high, Cole.
Pick a line you can drive through.

1111
01:34:51,770 --> 01:34:56,107
Cole, are you all right?
Answer me, please.

1112
01:34:58,277 --> 01:35:01,445
Go around those wrecks.
You can drive through it.

1113
01:35:03,407 --> 01:35:05,783
l know it. l know it in my heart.

1114
01:35:19,214 --> 01:35:21,132
l'm through it, Harry!

1115
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:25,344
l'm out of here.

1116
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:38,024
Cole's moved up to ninth.
He's coming on stfong.

1117
01:35:38,984 --> 01:35:42,445
Russ Wheeler in car number 18
continues to lead the way,

1118
01:35:42,529 --> 01:35:45,281
but the man on the move
is Cole Trickle.

1119
01:35:51,330 --> 01:35:53,664
l'm gonna make a hole
to get through here.

1120
01:36:00,505 --> 01:36:01,547
Here we go.

1121
01:36:12,643 --> 01:36:15,978
Wheeler knocked me into Ganz.
Ganz spun out.

1122
01:36:20,984 --> 01:36:22,360
He's going high.

1123
01:36:24,863 --> 01:36:26,072
God damn it!

1124
01:36:26,156 --> 01:36:29,450
And on the high side of the track,
Trickle takes the lead.

1125
01:36:29,534 --> 01:36:30,785
Go, Cole!

1126
01:36:35,207 --> 01:36:37,166
This is it, this is what it's all about.

1127
01:36:40,379 --> 01:36:44,882
awith just 23 laps to go,
Cole Trickle is leading.

1128
01:36:44,967 --> 01:36:47,468
-Take him now, Russ.
-He's all mine.

1129
01:37:01,108 --> 01:37:05,319
The accelerator is stuck, Harry.
lt's stuck, it's on the floorboard.

1130
01:37:06,697 --> 01:37:08,364
l can't slow down.

1131
01:37:09,408 --> 01:37:12,910
Step on the clutch and let the
son of a bitch blow it. lt's over, Cole.

1132
01:37:18,583 --> 01:37:19,959
Son of a...

1133
01:37:28,802 --> 01:37:29,927
Cole, you okay?

1134
01:37:30,012 --> 01:37:31,679
The good news is
the accelerator is fixed,

1135
01:37:31,763 --> 01:37:33,889
the bad news is
the transmission is screwed.

1136
01:37:33,974 --> 01:37:35,433
l'm coming in.

1137
01:37:49,823 --> 01:37:53,617
-Are they out of the race, yet?
-They will be in about 45 seconds.

1138
01:37:53,702 --> 01:37:54,869
That's the pace car.

1139
01:37:54,953 --> 01:37:58,289
Get me out in front of the pace car
or the race is over for us!

1140
01:37:58,373 --> 01:38:01,375
-The linkage is all twisted.
-Just give him the high gear.

1141
01:38:01,460 --> 01:38:03,044
Get me out there.

1142
01:38:04,129 --> 01:38:05,463
l got it.

1143
01:38:05,881 --> 01:38:07,882
Pace car's on its way.

1144
01:38:07,966 --> 01:38:09,383
Let's go.

1145
01:38:09,468 --> 01:38:12,428
-Come on, man, come on.
-Go! Go! Go!

1146
01:38:13,180 --> 01:38:16,474
Get out there and help them!
Go! Go! Go!

1147
01:38:26,526 --> 01:38:28,360
All right, all right, we made it.
Good work.

1148
01:38:29,488 --> 01:38:31,113
l owe you one.

1149
01:38:33,283 --> 01:38:35,576
Hey, you can't do that.
That's not your car.

1150
01:38:35,660 --> 01:38:38,245
lt's my engine in that car,
l gave him that engine,

1151
01:38:38,330 --> 01:38:40,206
and that's what my boys are pushing.

1152
01:38:42,667 --> 01:38:46,253
Cole, you better be at max speed
when the green flag dfops.

1153
01:38:50,884 --> 01:38:52,259
The pace car pulls off the track.

1154
01:38:52,344 --> 01:38:54,720
The green flag is out
and racing resumes.

1155
01:38:54,805 --> 01:38:56,597
Wheeler broke away,
he's still in the lead.

1156
01:39:02,729 --> 01:39:04,688
-Where am l?
-Running ninth.

1157
01:39:04,773 --> 01:39:06,899
-How many laps to go?
-Eight.

1158
01:39:12,739 --> 01:39:14,949
What's the interval
between me and Wheeler?

1159
01:39:15,033 --> 01:39:17,785
Trickle's fifth and moving up fast, Russ.

1160
01:39:27,712 --> 01:39:29,130
Remember me?

1161
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:39,140
l'm going to draft Wheeler,
make him pull me around the track.

1162
01:39:42,769 --> 01:39:44,478
The son of a bitch is on my ass.

1163
01:39:48,066 --> 01:39:52,278
He's going to take me on the outside.
l'm going to put him in the wall.

1164
01:40:01,580 --> 01:40:04,915
-What's going on, Cole?
-l'm just setting him up, Harry.

1165
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,877
There's the white flag. One lap to go.

1166
01:40:07,961 --> 01:40:09,420
Last lap, Cole.

1167
01:40:22,851 --> 01:40:27,938
-Don't keep this up, Cole, please.
-Harry, this guy's going down.

1168
01:40:33,528 --> 01:40:36,655
Last turn, be careful. He's going to try
and slingshot past you, Russ.

1169
01:40:36,740 --> 01:40:40,117
Don't worry, l know Cole.
He always goes to the outside.

1170
01:40:41,828 --> 01:40:43,787
This one's for you, Harry.

1171
01:40:45,957 --> 01:40:47,791
He's going high.

1172
01:40:51,296 --> 01:40:52,838
He's going low!

1173
01:40:54,799 --> 01:40:56,342
Son of a bitch!

1174
01:41:01,306 --> 01:41:04,600
Here come the cars to the finish line,
it's Cole Trickle taking the win.

1175
01:41:04,684 --> 01:41:06,227
All right! All right!

1176
01:41:45,684 --> 01:41:48,560
-l thought you weren't gonna watch.
-l lied.

1177
01:41:55,944 --> 01:41:58,237
-Where's Harry?
-l don't know.

1178
01:42:08,248 --> 01:42:09,540
Harry.

1179
01:42:12,794 --> 01:42:15,087
Harry, say something, will you?

1180
01:42:16,172 --> 01:42:18,090
l really can't. l can't.

1181
01:42:23,054 --> 01:42:26,807
You didn't know how this one
was going to turn out, did you?

1182
01:42:27,309 --> 01:42:29,059
lt's like you said.

1183
01:42:31,438 --> 01:42:34,315
There's nothing you can't do
in a racecar.

1184
01:42:35,608 --> 01:42:39,069
-We won. We won.
-l know. Yeah.

1185
01:42:40,822 --> 01:42:44,783
Now, can you walk,
or am l going to have to carry you?

1186
01:42:44,868 --> 01:42:46,243
Where to?

1187
01:42:47,412 --> 01:42:50,581
-Victory Lane.
-Yeah.

1188
01:42:52,917 --> 01:42:54,918
Walk? Hell,

1189
01:42:58,298 --> 01:42:59,923
l'll race your ass.
