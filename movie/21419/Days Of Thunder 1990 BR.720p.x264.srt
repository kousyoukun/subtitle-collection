1
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:18,263
Welcome to the Daytona 500,
the Superbowl of motor racing.

2
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:24,269
Walking onto the grid
is two-time champion Rowdy Burns.

3
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:30,984
A contender from Pennsylvania,
Aldo Bennedetti.

4
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:51,213
Gentlemen, start your engines.

5
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:39,261
Number 43, Richard Petty,
spins to the inside of the track.

6
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,099
Richard Petty is out
of the Daytona 500.

7
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:48,228
Speaking of people out of the race,
remember Harry Hogge?

8
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:55,068
His driver, Buddy Bretherton, died
here last year in a fiery crash.

9
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:01,325
- You're enjoying the good life.
- Yeah.

10
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:05,579
I never minded spreading a little
fertilizer around now and then.

11
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:09,249
- How's the truck running?
- Good.

12
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:14,129
I want you to build me a car.

13
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:23,972
Everybody knows some car dealer
who can't afford a race team.

14
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,850
No driver will sign with you.

15
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:31,647
If they wreck one car, you can't
afford to build them another.

16
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:36,235
No car's going to win without
a driver ... not even mine.

17
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,738
If you built the car,
I'd get a damn driver.

18
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:50,833
What kind of driver are you going
to find after the season's started?

19
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:55,838
You can work with him. You can
build a driver like you build a car.

20
00:04:56,004 --> 00:05:00,300
That hound is the best
coon dog I've ever seen.

21
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:04,721
- And l didn't teach him a thing.
- I've got somebody.

22
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:09,184
- Take a look at him.
- He doesn't sound like somebody.

23
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:13,564
Then take a look at nobody.

24
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:19,820
- Tim, l gave up racing.
- You didn't give up racing.

25
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:26,994
You quit to avoid an investigation
into Buddy's crash at Daytona.

26
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:33,333
I talked to NASCAR. lf you come back
there won't be an investigation.

27
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,587
- How did you sell them that deal?
- I'm a hell of a salesman.

28
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:46,013
Now that's a race car driver.

29
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:50,767
When's your driver due?

30
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,774
- Your guy runs those Indy types.
- Sprints, mainly.

31
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:04,740
Two championships, three all-star
wins, seven straight feature wins.

32
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:11,496
He's a real statistician.
Does he know anything about drivers?

33
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:21,840
- Harry, where's your driver from?
- Eagle Rock.

34
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:27,554
- Is that up around Wilkesboro?
- No. Glendale, California.

35
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:32,518
- He's a Yankee?
- Californians aren't Yankees.

36
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:37,814
- They're not really anything.
- You said it.

37
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:57,167
The shocks are right, we're
dialed in. Don't change a thing.

38
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:05,676
- Hey, you're looking pretty good.
- You're the one looking good.

39
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:10,889
It hasn't been easy, Harry,
but this bitch is ready to run.

40
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:16,186
We appreciate you letting us
use the car, Rowdy.

41
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:22,234
l told you. Harry's got a new driver
and he needs a car for a few laps.

42
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,280
Harry Hogge asked us personally
as a favor.

43
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:35,080
Who is this driver?.

44
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:09,823
Tim tells me
you've been running open wheels.

45
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:14,661
Now you just want
to up and drive NASCAR?

46
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:20,501
- This is stock car racing.
- I've watched it on television.

47
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:27,090
- You've seen it on television?
- ESPN, the coverage is excellent.

48
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:32,304
This may not be the best time
for you to run this car.

49
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:37,267
- Is there some problem?
- No, sir.

50
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:42,022
You bend this bitch,
and I'll tear your balls off.

51
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,119
Would you mind very much
holding on to this?

52
00:08:56,286 --> 00:09:00,290
Didn't you hear what that man said?

53
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:09,508
- Hold on, we ought to talk.
- About how I'm going to run?

54
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:15,264
About how you've managed to live
so long. You ain't racing this car.

55
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:27,985
What's going on?
You said you'd look at him.

56
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:32,072
- I've looked at him.
- l paid $2,500 to use this track.

57
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:38,829
- Forget it. He needs a brand name.
- l know a driver when l see one.

58
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:46,503
- Harry, is this happening or what?
- Do us all a favor, Harry.

59
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:58,056
Let me drive.
l won't make a fool out of you.

60
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:09,443
That tunnel turn is real tricky.
Hot or cold, it's slick.

61
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:14,990
You'll slam into the wall
before you know it. So take it easy.

62
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:30,130
- I'm dropping the hammer.
- No, you're not.

63
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:07,543
- it's under Rowdy's time.
- He should've cracked up the car.

64
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:26,478
- That was fast.
- Yeah?

65
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:31,900
31 flat. That's good enough to take
the pole in the last race here.

66
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:40,742
- You never drove a stock car?.
- No, sprints mainly.

67
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:46,290
- Buck Bretherton.
- Cole Trickle, nice to meet you.

68
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:51,003
You were one lucky son of a bitch
in the tunnel turn.

69
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:54,923
lf you think it was luck,
let's do it again.

70
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:57,176
You run good.

71
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:01,930
Go get your own car
and we'll see how you do in a crowd.

72
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:08,854
- What's wrong with open wheels?
- l lost my ride.

73
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:13,233
After all those wins,
you were fired?

74
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:19,990
l lost my ride. I'd have quit
regardless. l wasn't going anywhere.

75
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:24,119
- Where do you want to go?
- Indianapolis.

76
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:29,833
To win in Indy I'd need a great car,
but stock cars are all the same.

77
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,754
There's nothing stock
about a stock car.

78
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:39,176
I'm not trying to insult you, but
stock cars are built to run equal.

79
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:46,433
- l won't be beaten by a car.
- Only by a driver.

80
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:51,480
You build me a car,
and I'll win Daytona next year.

81
00:12:56,693 --> 00:13:01,406
I'm going to give you an engine
low to the ground.

82
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:05,869
An extra-big oil pan
that'll cut the wind underneath you.

83
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:11,375
That'll give you
30-40 more horsepower.

84
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:16,839
I'll give you a fuel line
that'll hold an extra gallon of gas.

85
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:21,134
I'll shave half an inch off you
and shape you like a bullet.

86
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:25,347
When l get you primed,
painted and weighed ...

87
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:32,354
... you're going to be ready
to go out on that racetrack.

88
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:35,941
You're going to be perfect.

89
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:50,224
I'm going to pull
this rookie's chain.

90
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:59,733
- Cole, you're all over the track.
- He just slammed into me.

91
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:05,781
He didn't slam you or bump you.
He rubbed you. Rubbing is racing.

92
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:17,793
There goes the fender.

93
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:23,632
There goes the quarter panel.

94
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:56,623
While we're still under a caution,
go out and hit the pace car.

95
00:15:56,832 --> 00:16:00,961
Hit the pace car?. What for?.

96
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:07,634
You hit every other damn thing
out there. l want you to be perfect.

97
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:25,110
You're too high.

98
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:50,093
How about that?
This side we don't have to fix.

99
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:56,892
l don't want you spoiled, Buck.

100
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,077
This is gonna hurt.

101
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:22,709
Did you see that guy?.

102
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:39,434
- I've got to pit.
- No, we're busy now.

103
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:43,730
- We're eating ice cream.
- Ice cream!

104
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:59,788
You can come in and get one,
but it wouldn't impress NASCAR.

105
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:04,877
You have enough trouble
riding around the track as it is.

106
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:21,059
Take it easy.

107
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:24,438
Come on now, Cole!

108
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:38,035
We messed up big-time on Sunday.
l had sponsors in the stands.

109
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:44,124
l was hugging and holding hands
and praying for a good showing.

110
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:49,338
And we end up looking like
a monkey fucking a football.

111
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:57,638
Everybody out, please ...
except you two.

112
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:10,984
I've got a question: What is the one
thing you need to do to win a race?

113
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:15,489
- it's pretty obvious ...
- Quiet! You must finish the race.

114
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:20,118
l realize that Harry's
been around a long time.

115
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:24,957
But l need a proper car
that doesn't blow engines.

116
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:29,378
lf he didn't over-rev the engine,
it wouldn't blow.

117
00:19:29,545 --> 00:19:32,506
When you shift the gear, -

118
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:39,429
- and the needle on the tach
reads 9,000 rpm, that's bad.

119
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:45,769
- The tires blow, is that my fault?
- Yes, it's your fault.

120
00:19:45,936 --> 00:19:49,523
There's 40 other drivers out there
who don't use up their tires.

121
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:54,194
There's nothing l can't do
with a race car.

122
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:58,031
- There's only so much l can do!
- That's obvious.

123
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:01,869
He doesn't need
to appreciate your job to do his.

124
00:20:02,077 --> 00:20:06,206
He has to know
what a car can and can't do!

125
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:11,336
You want me to work the pit
and you drive?

126
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:16,133
l can't talk to this son of a bitch.

127
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:22,347
l can't talk to that son of a bitch.
l really can't.

128
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:29,855
- You think he can drive?
- He can drive.

129
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:33,483
He can drive
beyond the limits of the car!

130
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,904
lf he'd listen to me,
we'd never lose a race.

131
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:44,786
lf we don't get a sponsor soon,
my ass is fried.

132
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:51,585
I'm liable to be out
of the car business all together.

133
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:56,048
Harry, l know you're great.
You know you're great.

134
00:20:56,215 --> 00:21:01,178
But if the driver doesn't trust you,
we're never going to win a race.

135
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:17,319
Hey, Harry.

136
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:26,620
- We've got to talk.
- All right, talk.

137
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:29,873
On the radio during the race ...

138
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:35,128
You've got to tell us
what's going on with the car.

139
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:38,257
You want to change the way l drive.

140
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:41,760
Set up the car
so l don't have to change.

141
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:45,764
- Tell me how.
- What do you want to know?.

142
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:49,017
Is she running loose or tight?

143
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:54,022
A turn here, take some wedge out,
we'll win some races.

144
00:21:54,231 --> 00:22:00,487
l can't do that. l don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

145
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:04,158
How do you mean that?

146
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:17,796
- l don't know much about cars.
- Neither does any other driver.

147
00:22:17,963 --> 00:22:22,009
No, l really don't know.
A turn here? A wedge there?

148
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:25,596
- l don't know.
- How can that be?

149
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:30,058
They told me
to get in a car and drive.

150
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:37,733
I'd like to help out, but l can't.
l don't have the vocabulary.

151
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:49,244
Well ... we're just going
to have to figure one out.

152
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:57,085
Don't worry about it.
All right?

153
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:02,049
How does she feel?

154
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:08,931
- Her ass is all over the place.
- Her rear end is loose.

155
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:13,310
''Loose'' is fast, and ''on the edge''
is out of control.

156
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:20,984
Cole, there is something else.

157
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:27,282
- Tires is what wins a race.
- What are you talking about?

158
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:32,788
lf you can't run without melting
the tires, we can't finish a race.

159
00:23:32,955 --> 00:23:36,375
What do you want?

160
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:40,838
Run 50 laps any way you like,
then 50 laps like l want you to.

161
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:45,676
Give me an honest run.
lf you do, I'll beat you.

162
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:04,027
Now we're going to do it
50 laps my way.

163
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:08,907
When you were racing Indy cars,
the tires were twice as wide -

164
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:14,830
- and the car weighed half as much.
Now it's the opposite.

165
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:20,169
You're burning them up.
They melt and get greasy.

166
00:24:20,335 --> 00:24:26,091
You slip and slide
and you're out of control. Let's go!

167
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:45,110
His way, my way.
l was six seconds faster.

168
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:49,489
You can buy me some lunch
at the highway joint.

169
00:25:04,254 --> 00:25:08,091
- What's wrong?
- We're figuring out what to do.

170
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:12,596
- About what?
- We're in trouble.

171
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:18,393
Rowdy took the pole in 30:25.
We're almost a second off the pace.

172
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,397
We're looking for some speed.

173
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:27,236
The car's perfect, Harry.

174
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:42,960
it's the first race of the season at
Darlington International Speedway.

175
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:48,382
You're running 12th.
30 laps to go.

176
00:26:00,686 --> 00:26:06,692
- You're going to burn the tires.
- Everybody else slowed down.

177
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:11,738
He's right. Check his lap times.
Everybody else has fallen off.

178
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:18,328
You're doing good, Cole.
You're gaining on the leader.

179
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:25,002
15 to go.

180
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:30,132
Don't pass
on the outside of turn four.

181
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:35,512
Stay to the inside.
Ten laps to go.

182
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:42,811
Trickle is right behind Rowdy Burns.

183
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:48,233
- I'm right behind the leader.
- Five laps to go.

184
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:54,072
- Remember me?
- What the hell's going on?

185
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:57,409
Just a little rubbing.
Rubbing's racing.

186
00:27:03,624 --> 00:27:07,211
I'm going to take this rookie
once and for all.

187
00:27:11,256 --> 00:27:16,386
That's enough!
You can't play with Rowdy like this.

188
00:27:16,595 --> 00:27:19,139
Relax, Harry.

189
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:24,811
Rowdy Burns is out!

190
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:29,483
No! An incredible recovery by Rowdy.

191
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:35,072
We have a new leader.
Cole Trickle in number 46.

192
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:38,659
We're under caution
with three laps to go.

193
00:27:38,826 --> 00:27:42,079
- Come on in.
- What for?. it's almost over.

194
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:45,874
You've done 68 laps.
Everybody's got to pit, Cole.

195
00:27:56,552 --> 00:27:59,179
Go, go!

196
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:03,517
The air gun's jammed,
get me another one.

197
00:28:06,812 --> 00:28:10,232
Let's go!

198
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:16,488
Damn it! Go! Go!

199
00:28:16,655 --> 00:28:19,616
Get them on quick!

200
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:32,963
- Son of a bitch!
- Now, Cole ...

201
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:40,721
- Son of a bitch!
- We're on the air, all right?

202
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:45,225
l was in first place. Now I'm
in third with two laps to go.

203
00:28:45,434 --> 00:28:51,023
Don't get excited.
Third place is pretty respectable.

204
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:56,570
Going into turn four,
drive right by him on the outside.

205
00:28:56,737 --> 00:29:00,240
Nobody goes to the outside
on turn four.

206
00:29:00,449 --> 00:29:06,955
- You can hold it.
- He's going to end up in the wall.

207
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:12,377
The pace car is about to go off.
We don't have time to talk.

208
00:29:12,544 --> 00:29:16,715
- We've got a good set of tires on.
- What?

209
00:29:16,882 --> 00:29:21,094
- Those tires are matched perfect.
- You're going to get him killed.

210
00:29:21,261 --> 00:29:26,642
lf you go to the outside,
you can hold it.

211
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:29,019
All right.

212
00:29:37,027 --> 00:29:41,073
The white flag is out.
One lap to go.

213
00:29:57,506 --> 00:30:01,260
The boy don't have the balls
to pass me on the outside.

214
00:30:01,426 --> 00:30:05,806
They're heading into
treacherous turn four.

215
00:30:30,914 --> 00:30:35,043
Cole Trickle wins his first ever
NASCAR victory.

216
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:39,339
Second place goes to Rowdy Burns.

217
00:30:48,015 --> 00:30:54,021
On that last turn, did you know you
could make the car stick like that?

218
00:30:54,229 --> 00:30:59,985
l knew it all along.
Harry put on special tires.

219
00:31:00,152 --> 00:31:05,532
- What's special about them?
- Nothing in particular.

220
00:31:07,451 --> 00:31:11,288
- You told me ...
- l had to calm you down.

221
00:31:11,497 --> 00:31:16,043
You were acting like such
a candy-ass when the air gun stuck.

222
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:26,011
Try this on for size.
We've got ourselves a sponsor.

223
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:36,730
Promise me that whatever else we do
from here, we win Daytona.

224
00:31:36,897 --> 00:31:39,983
That's a promise.

225
00:31:45,322 --> 00:31:51,662
Selling useless mining stock
is called a dog and pony show.

226
00:31:51,829 --> 00:31:57,918
It may be funny, but it's not that
funny when it happens to you.

227
00:31:58,126 --> 00:32:03,757
- It happened to me.
- You bought worthless stock?.

228
00:32:03,924 --> 00:32:08,470
l told you l lost my ride.
That's how l lost it.

229
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:13,308
Team owner was a conman
selling junk bonds.

230
00:32:13,475 --> 00:32:17,062
But mainly he sold stolen yachts.

231
00:32:17,229 --> 00:32:20,983
After l won, he used my name
to promote the sales.

232
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:25,696
He went to jail
and l lost my ride.

233
00:32:27,447 --> 00:32:32,870
- It was pretty humiliating.
- Hell, don't be embarrassed.

234
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:37,666
Some lowlife piece of trash
put you in a bad position.

235
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:45,174
That depends on whether you're
related to that piece of trash.

236
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,553
He was my father.

237
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:54,349
I've never really
stuck with anything since.

238
00:32:54,516 --> 00:33:00,480
They don't trust me,
and l don't trust them.

239
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:04,151
Like for instance ...

240
00:33:04,318 --> 00:33:09,281
You lied to me today. It was
dumb-luck l didn't end up crashed.

241
00:33:09,448 --> 00:33:14,578
- l ought to punch you out.
- Yeah? Give it a try.

242
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:20,626
No.

243
00:33:20,792 --> 00:33:25,756
l wouldn't want my ass kicked
by a 60-year-old man.

244
00:33:25,964 --> 00:33:28,342
59.

245
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:46,610
Drivers just don't go
to the outside like that.

246
00:33:46,777 --> 00:33:52,866
l knew you could do it.
l believed it in my heart.

247
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,040
- Peach or cherry?.
- Cherry.

248
00:34:03,502 --> 00:34:07,005
l need a leak.

249
00:34:07,214 --> 00:34:11,760
There's calculating drivers,
and then there's kamikaze drivers.

250
00:34:11,927 --> 00:34:18,350
Cole here's a kamikaze,
like my pappy was. Buddy Bretherton.

251
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:23,105
Buddy Bretherton was your dad?

252
00:34:23,313 --> 00:34:27,150
- He died at Daytona.
- Last year.

253
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:31,029
- How did it happen?
- He hit the wall.

254
00:34:31,196 --> 00:34:37,286
He was probably dead before that.
The coroner reported a heart attack.

255
00:34:52,217 --> 00:34:55,304
We've been pulled over.

256
00:34:59,016 --> 00:35:05,105
Everybody out and up against
the wall. You're under arrest.

257
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,276
- What the hell for?.
- That.

258
00:35:09,443 --> 00:35:14,156
Transportation of alcohol
for the purpose of distribution.

259
00:35:14,323 --> 00:35:18,494
This is not distribution,
this is consumption.

260
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:25,250
That doesn't make it legal.
Up against the wall.

261
00:35:37,179 --> 00:35:42,059
It looks like we've found something.
A concealed weapon.

262
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:46,480
- Where?
- Right here.

263
00:35:52,444 --> 00:35:56,365
Now, the only question is:

264
00:36:00,828 --> 00:36:04,331
Will he actually use it?

265
00:36:16,468 --> 00:36:21,348
Don't be mad. Harry and the boys
thought you might like me.

266
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:33,360
Here we are for summer speed week
in Daytona Beach, Florida.

267
00:36:33,569 --> 00:36:39,074
The favorite today is newcomer
Cole Trickle in number 46.

268
00:36:39,241 --> 00:36:44,913
He has won an unprecedented
five out of his last six races.

269
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:05,976
Stop playing peek-a-boo
in Rowdy's rear-view mirror.

270
00:37:10,898 --> 00:37:15,444
- I'm not doing anything like that.
- Then what are you doing?

271
00:37:18,405 --> 00:37:22,242
l loosened his bumper.
I'll have to break it off.

272
00:37:22,451 --> 00:37:26,497
lf his bumper goes through
your radiator, you're finished.

273
00:37:28,332 --> 00:37:32,419
Rowdy, let him go by.

274
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,467
I'm going to take him
on the high side.

275
00:37:57,152 --> 00:38:04,451
- What are you worried about, Harry?.
- Great recovery, Cole.

276
00:38:12,459 --> 00:38:17,422
Trickle's right behind the number 51
car, and they'll go at it again.

277
00:38:27,766 --> 00:38:31,979
There's a crash
coming out of turn four.

278
00:38:35,732 --> 00:38:37,860
l see it.

279
00:39:09,057 --> 00:39:14,438
- l can't see anything.
- Wiggle your fingers for me.

280
00:39:14,605 --> 00:39:18,192
l can't see anything.

281
00:39:18,358 --> 00:39:21,528
I'm all right.

282
00:39:28,243 --> 00:39:32,498
- l don't need recharging.
- It's standard procedure.

283
00:39:32,664 --> 00:39:36,001
- You go screw yourself.
- What was that?

284
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:39,296
l wouldn't tell you to do that.

285
00:39:47,054 --> 00:39:51,350
- Tell me what's going on.
- What's your name?

286
00:39:51,558 --> 00:39:58,232
- Cole.
- Cole, lie still, please.

287
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:03,737
- CAT scan, right away.
- Yes, Doctor.

288
00:40:11,495 --> 00:40:15,874
He's had a concussion. His brain
is bruised and it's going to swell.

289
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:19,253
That's what's affecting his vision.

290
00:40:19,461 --> 00:40:22,464
You have a concussion.

291
00:40:22,631 --> 00:40:26,760
- It will affect your vision.
- Will it go away?.

292
00:40:26,927 --> 00:40:30,931
Tell him we're running some tests.

293
00:40:31,098 --> 00:40:35,102
What did his helmet look like?
Was it cracked?

294
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:39,314
- No.
- Was it scratched?

295
00:40:41,024 --> 00:40:44,862
Was the helmet scratched
at the front or back?.

296
00:40:45,028 --> 00:40:49,908
- The back and the front.
- Are you a brain doctor?

297
00:40:50,075 --> 00:40:54,204
Could someone talk to me?

298
00:40:55,914 --> 00:41:01,837
When I'm driving, I've got a guy
on the radio who talks to me.

299
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:10,137
Don't worry,
we're going to take care of him.

300
00:41:37,956 --> 00:41:40,083
Harry.

301
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:44,087
- Are you okay, Harry?.
- Yeah. Why?.

302
00:41:47,466 --> 00:41:52,095
You look all bent out of shape.

303
00:41:55,015 --> 00:42:00,938
- Hell, it's probably just my eyes.
- No, I've been here all night.

304
00:42:01,146 --> 00:42:05,234
Jesus! What are they giving me here?

305
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,987
What happened?

306
00:42:09,196 --> 00:42:14,159
Rowdy was spinning across the track.

307
00:42:14,326 --> 00:42:18,539
The rule is, go straight for them.

308
00:42:18,747 --> 00:42:23,126
So l never took my foot off the gas.

309
00:42:23,335 --> 00:42:29,675
He should have been gone by the time
l got there ... but he wasn't.

310
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:36,390
l think another car hit you
and knocked you into Rowdy.

311
00:42:38,475 --> 00:42:43,856
It's one of those things that never
happens. Don't even think about it.

312
00:42:47,401 --> 00:42:51,613
- I'll get the doctor.
- l feel great.

313
00:43:09,965 --> 00:43:13,719
Damn nice to see you, Cole.

314
00:43:16,013 --> 00:43:20,058
It's damn nice to see you, Buck.

315
00:43:22,477 --> 00:43:25,898
Cole, you've met Dr Lewicki.

316
00:43:29,902 --> 00:43:33,655
- That's your doctor.
- He's not actually seen me before.

317
00:43:33,864 --> 00:43:36,408
Sure, Harry.

318
00:43:37,409 --> 00:43:41,079
- No ...
- Dr Lewicki.

319
00:43:41,288 --> 00:43:46,793
Smock, stethoscope.
It's a great costume, Harry.

320
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,631
- How are you, Doc?
- This really is Dr Lewicki.

321
00:43:50,797 --> 00:43:56,470
- l was just about to go off duty.
- You came by to look me over.

322
00:43:56,678 --> 00:44:00,974
That's not a bad idea.
Is your vision restored?

323
00:44:01,183 --> 00:44:05,020
- l think so.
- Nothing's blurred?

324
00:44:05,229 --> 00:44:09,858
No haloes around objects?
Flashing lights?

325
00:44:10,025 --> 00:44:14,905
- What are you going to do now?.
- Look into your eyes.

326
00:44:15,113 --> 00:44:18,033
Doc ...

327
00:44:19,952 --> 00:44:24,665
Isn't this
what you're really looking for?.

328
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:30,879
That's interesting enough,
but it's just not my specialty.

329
00:44:43,267 --> 00:44:49,189
- She was the real thing?
- l wouldn't be joking around here.

330
00:44:49,398 --> 00:44:52,818
Sorry, I'm trying not to smile.

331
00:44:52,985 --> 00:44:56,071
All right, get out.

332
00:44:56,238 --> 00:44:59,324
Get out of here.

333
00:45:08,292 --> 00:45:12,921
- l can walk.
- Not while you're in this hospital.

334
00:45:15,966 --> 00:45:23,015
- Can you pick up the pace a little?
- lf you want drugs, see the nurse.

335
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,096
Get out of the way.

336
00:46:08,268 --> 00:46:13,899
Good morning, gentlemen.
Right this way.

337
00:46:17,778 --> 00:46:22,741
Neither Mr. Burns nor Mr. Trickle
have any significant cranial injury.

338
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:27,329
Let's have that in English.
Did they mess up their squash?

339
00:46:27,496 --> 00:46:31,708
Their brains are intact ...
as much as they ever were.

340
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:36,839
- Do they get clearance to race?
- It's a dangerous pastime.

341
00:46:37,047 --> 00:46:42,594
- That's not a medical objection.
- They won't get clearance just yet.

342
00:46:42,761 --> 00:46:47,891
- That's total horseshit.
- Gentlemen, please ...

343
00:46:48,058 --> 00:46:52,688
l think they'd like another opinion.
We'd like to talk to your boss.

344
00:46:59,194 --> 00:47:01,738
Which is a re-evaluation
in a week or two.

345
00:47:01,905 --> 00:47:05,909
Thank you. We have something
to say to the boys in private.

346
00:47:13,959 --> 00:47:16,503
Okay, Big John's turn.

347
00:47:22,593 --> 00:47:28,098
lf you want to become a greasy
spot on a country road, go ahead.

348
00:47:28,265 --> 00:47:31,810
l don't give a shit
and l don't think anybody else does.

349
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:36,565
But you're not going to do it
on my racetrack.

350
00:47:36,773 --> 00:47:42,279
You've all heard
of Japanese inspection?

351
00:47:42,446 --> 00:47:47,075
When the Japs get a load of lettuce
they don't want in the country, -

352
00:47:47,284 --> 00:47:51,830
- they let it sit on the docks
until they get ready to look at it.

353
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:57,503
By then it's all gone rotten.
There's nothing left to inspect.

354
00:47:57,669 --> 00:48:02,633
Lettuce is a perishable item,
like you two monkeys.

355
00:48:02,841 --> 00:48:08,514
You trade paint one more time,
I'll black flag the two of you.

356
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:13,393
I'll take apart your race car
for inspection.

357
00:48:13,602 --> 00:48:17,523
After you've put it back together,
you can race.

358
00:48:17,689 --> 00:48:22,569
Now, as there's no hard feelings,
we're all going out to dinner.

359
00:48:22,736 --> 00:48:28,200
- I've got other plans.
- You'll have to change them.

360
00:48:28,367 --> 00:48:33,330
You two are going
to drive to dinner together.

361
00:48:39,795 --> 00:48:42,172
Dr Lewicki ...

362
00:48:42,381 --> 00:48:47,261
l want to apologize
for what happened with Cole.

363
00:48:47,427 --> 00:48:53,058
It's nothing to worry about.
It was hardly your doing.

364
00:48:53,225 --> 00:49:01,108
That's just it, it was. Not long
ago, we played a trick on Cole.

365
00:49:01,275 --> 00:49:05,654
We dressed up a pretty girl
in a highway-patrol uniform.

366
00:49:05,821 --> 00:49:11,577
We told her to get real ornery
with him and she did.

367
00:49:11,743 --> 00:49:16,373
- You mean ..?
- l mean real ornery.

368
00:49:16,582 --> 00:49:23,547
- Why do you want me to know this?
- Don't hold a bad opinion of Cole.

369
00:49:23,714 --> 00:49:29,887
l believe it scares him. He needs
reassurance from you that he's okay.

370
00:49:30,053 --> 00:49:33,807
After all, you're his doctor.

371
00:49:38,645 --> 00:49:41,648
That's it.

372
00:50:00,375 --> 00:50:02,419
Doc ...

373
00:50:02,628 --> 00:50:08,717
l heard you thought
l was a highway-patrol officer.

374
00:50:08,926 --> 00:50:13,013
- Thank you for taking care of me.
- It's my job.

375
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:19,978
- It's my life.
- This time let's shake hands.

376
00:50:20,145 --> 00:50:24,858
- Of course.
- Good luck, Cole.

377
00:50:32,032 --> 00:50:36,662
- Dr Lewicki, could l see you?
- You will, l promise.

378
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:42,292
l mean have some dinner,
I'll take you to a race.

379
00:50:42,459 --> 00:50:48,006
That's very sweet, but it won't get
you back on the track any faster.

380
00:50:48,173 --> 00:50:50,217
No ...

381
00:50:50,425 --> 00:50:54,012
It's not what l meant.

382
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:20,164
- Now what?
- Here's how l see this deal ...

383
00:51:20,372 --> 00:51:26,295
Neither of us is going to let
the other drive this car to dinner.

384
00:51:26,461 --> 00:51:31,675
- There's only one way to settle it.
- What are you talking about?

385
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:38,182
Absolutely.

386
00:52:17,137 --> 00:52:24,019
Let me tell you something. lf you
can't control your race drivers ...

387
00:52:25,938 --> 00:52:28,857
Stick to something you can control.

388
00:52:31,235 --> 00:52:35,781
Like used cars
in downtown Charlotte.

389
00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:59,763
- Too close to call?
- Yeah.

390
00:53:10,899 --> 00:53:16,196
- You're late.
- We had car trouble.

391
00:53:16,363 --> 00:53:23,412
- What kind of car trouble?
- l believe it was the radiator.

392
00:53:23,579 --> 00:53:27,499
Yes, Rowdy, l believe it was.

393
00:53:34,965 --> 00:53:37,426
Do you know anybody
at Daytona Memorial?

394
00:53:37,593 --> 00:53:41,889
- The chief of staff.
- Is he a race fan?

395
00:53:42,097 --> 00:53:47,144
Russ Wheeler is driving for us,
till you get your medical clearance.

396
00:53:47,311 --> 00:53:51,482
It's a real pleasure
to race your car, Mr. Trickle.

397
00:53:51,648 --> 00:53:56,195
l need the home address
of a doctor ...

398
00:53:56,361 --> 00:54:01,658
I'm only sorry l won't be able
to drive it as good as you.

399
00:54:01,825 --> 00:54:05,829
I'll see you later, Harry.

400
00:54:05,996 --> 00:54:09,333
The doctor ...

401
00:54:14,171 --> 00:54:17,257
What?

402
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:37,277
l was desperate
to get your attention.

403
00:54:37,444 --> 00:54:41,698
You got it.
l walked into a jungle.

404
00:54:41,865 --> 00:54:47,704
It's nicely extravagant,
but l can't. I'm a doctor on call.

405
00:54:47,871 --> 00:54:53,544
Somebody has to re-examine me.
I'll take you to a race.

406
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:59,633
l don't want to watch you guys
chasing each other on my day off.

407
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,886
How about chasing me
on your day off?

408
00:55:03,095 --> 00:55:07,891
l don't have a day off.
I'm on call 24 hours.

409
00:55:08,058 --> 00:55:12,146
- Let's suppose you had a day off.
- Sugar.

410
00:55:14,857 --> 00:55:17,943
Could l interest you
in the North Carolina countryside?

411
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:21,613
- Speaking theoretically?.
- Speaking theoretically.

412
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:25,200
Maybe.
You'd have to convince my boss.

413
00:55:25,367 --> 00:55:29,121
Good. How tall are you?

414
00:55:44,803 --> 00:55:49,850
- What did he say?.
- Fly to Charlotte to see the boys.

415
00:55:53,729 --> 00:55:57,941
You're very quick.

416
00:55:58,108 --> 00:56:02,488
You ought to see me drive.

417
00:56:04,865 --> 00:56:09,411
- Rowdy is not here.
- l told him to be here by five.

418
00:56:09,578 --> 00:56:14,374
We should probably get started
on Cole.

419
00:56:17,377 --> 00:56:20,339
Close your eyes. Palms up.

420
00:56:22,341 --> 00:56:26,011
Open your eyes. Arms down.

421
00:56:27,012 --> 00:56:29,723
Follow my finger.

422
00:56:44,404 --> 00:56:48,951
Stand with your feet together
and close your eyes.

423
00:56:51,036 --> 00:56:55,290
Walk one foot in front of the other.
Open your eyes.

424
00:56:57,501 --> 00:57:00,838
Back on the table.

425
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:12,057
- This is tough.
- Examinations always are.

426
00:57:12,224 --> 00:57:15,644
l might not like what l see.

427
00:57:15,811 --> 00:57:22,067
That has to worry you. Pick a spot
on the wall and look at it.

428
00:57:25,195 --> 00:57:31,285
Please, don't move your eyes.
Just focus on one spot.

429
00:57:40,002 --> 00:57:44,965
- What do you see?
- The retina.

430
00:57:45,132 --> 00:57:49,261
What does it look like?

431
00:57:49,428 --> 00:57:53,724
Very pretty, actually.

432
00:57:59,771 --> 00:58:02,774
- Seen enough?
- Just about.

433
00:58:05,319 --> 00:58:10,741
- What did you do that for?.
- It's the Lowinski sign.

434
00:58:10,908 --> 00:58:16,038
lf the toe goes up, you're in
trouble. You're cleared to race.

435
00:58:34,681 --> 00:58:39,311
I'm sorry,
it just drove me nuts in there.

436
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:45,859
- How could you ignore me like that?
- l wasn't ignoring you!

437
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:56,286
l wasn't ignoring you.
l gave you a very thorough physical.

438
00:59:03,585 --> 00:59:07,881
- Don't do anything weird.
- l won't.

439
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:11,510
It's something
Harry and l work on together.

440
00:59:11,677 --> 00:59:14,680
It's called draughting.

441
00:59:14,888 --> 00:59:20,394
One car tucks in behind another.
Two cars can go faster than one.

442
00:59:20,561 --> 00:59:24,481
They divide the air resistance.

443
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:28,986
The lead car has to floor it
to hit 200 mph.

444
00:59:29,194 --> 00:59:34,241
The car behind doesn't. He can go
just as fast with power in reserve.

445
00:59:34,408 --> 00:59:38,245
When these two cars
come off that last turn, -

446
00:59:38,412 --> 00:59:42,875
- the car at the back
can move out of the draught, -

447
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:49,047
- slingshot past the lead car
and beat it to the finish line.

448
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:53,594
He goes straight to Victory Lane.

449
00:59:53,760 --> 01:00:00,559
- You and Harry work on that?
- More or less.

450
01:00:00,726 --> 01:00:07,232
Yeah, right. Is there anything
you want to do besides racing?

451
01:00:11,069 --> 01:00:18,035
- Anything you say.
- You must want something else ...

452
01:00:18,202 --> 01:00:21,371
... eventually.

453
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:29,630
l can tell you what l don't want
to be in life, and that's a fraud.

454
01:00:29,838 --> 01:00:36,178
l want to know it's not just luck
that gets me round that racetrack.

455
01:00:36,386 --> 01:00:41,266
- But that's not what you're asking.
- What am l asking?

456
01:00:41,433 --> 01:00:48,232
- How can l be in bed with this guy?.
- l know the answer to that one.

457
01:00:48,398 --> 01:00:55,155
How could a brilliant brain doctor
be in bed with a racing driver?.

458
01:00:57,783 --> 01:01:02,412
What's your response to that,
by the way?.

459
01:01:02,621 --> 01:01:07,501
Do something to make me respect you.

460
01:01:07,709 --> 01:01:12,089
Tell me what you love
so much about racing.

461
01:01:12,297 --> 01:01:15,300
The speed.

462
01:01:15,467 --> 01:01:18,303
To be able to control it.

463
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:23,684
To know that l can control
something that's out of control.

464
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:29,857
I'd really have to show you.

465
01:01:30,065 --> 01:01:33,068
Show me.

466
01:01:53,547 --> 01:02:00,679
It's funny. When l grew up, all l
wanted to do was work on race cars.

467
01:02:00,846 --> 01:02:05,809
Now all l want to do is to make
enough money to work on a farm.

468
01:02:06,018 --> 01:02:10,647
- Hi, Claire, I'm Jennie.
- Nice to meet you.

469
01:02:16,653 --> 01:02:20,240
We're going to build
our permanent home up there.

470
01:02:20,407 --> 01:02:24,411
- Does it cost much?
- About $10 million.

471
01:02:24,578 --> 01:02:28,707
Jennie's doing the building.
She's designing the house.

472
01:02:28,874 --> 01:02:33,921
We just want a place
that no one's lived in but us.

473
01:02:37,508 --> 01:02:40,427
- What is it?
- I'm just seasick.

474
01:02:45,349 --> 01:02:49,269
You didn't forget
about the physical.

475
01:02:49,436 --> 01:02:53,899
Nobody in my family goes to a doctor
unless they're dying.

476
01:02:54,107 --> 01:02:59,238
- I'm just not feeling good.
- Stand with your feet together.

477
01:03:01,865 --> 01:03:04,952
Put your arms out.

478
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:08,580
Close your eyes.

479
01:03:13,043 --> 01:03:19,049
Take it easy. I've got you.

480
01:03:19,258 --> 01:03:22,511
I'm fine.

481
01:03:26,515 --> 01:03:28,559
I'm fine.

482
01:03:29,852 --> 01:03:32,396
Go back to Daytona.

483
01:03:32,604 --> 01:03:39,403
The head of neurosurgery is my boss.
He's as good as they come.

484
01:03:41,488 --> 01:03:45,868
- Did you get sick in there?
- No.

485
01:03:46,034 --> 01:03:53,750
He did, he got sick.
You're one hell of a candy-ass.

486
01:03:53,917 --> 01:03:59,548
It's imperative that you get back
to Daytona and see Dr Wilhaire.

487
01:04:14,813 --> 01:04:19,526
There's another new Winston Cup team
sponsored by Hardee's.

488
01:04:19,693 --> 01:04:22,613
The driver is Russ Wheeler, -

489
01:04:22,779 --> 01:04:25,866
- the young man who subbed
so superbly for Cole Trickle.

490
01:04:26,074 --> 01:04:30,621
Listen to this horseshit.

491
01:04:30,829 --> 01:04:36,418
With these two competitive spirits,
will there be any conflict?

492
01:04:36,585 --> 01:04:43,008
We believe we can maintain the
integrity of these two race teams.

493
01:04:43,217 --> 01:04:45,969
Who will you be rooting for, Tim?

494
01:04:46,136 --> 01:04:50,307
I'll wave to Cole
every time l lap him.

495
01:04:56,522 --> 01:05:00,359
- These new tires are terrible.
- You're doing good, Cole.

496
01:05:00,567 --> 01:05:04,321
I'm too loose.

497
01:05:08,325 --> 01:05:13,705
- The car feels all wrong.
- Cole's upset.

498
01:05:13,872 --> 01:05:19,503
- What about?
- About being in that race car.

499
01:05:21,588 --> 01:05:27,261
Wheeler just passed the eight car.
He's coming up on your inside.

500
01:05:36,061 --> 01:05:39,314
Jesus!

501
01:06:10,345 --> 01:06:13,265
- The engine blew.
- How?.

502
01:06:13,432 --> 01:06:16,768
I'm not a mechanic, Harry.

503
01:06:29,656 --> 01:06:33,911
I'm in Georgia.
Rowdy's in North Carolina.

504
01:06:34,077 --> 01:06:38,790
Somebody better
talk him into coming down here.

505
01:06:38,957 --> 01:06:44,963
The longer he ignores it, the more
damage will be done to his brain.

506
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:49,051
- Where's Cole?
- He's on the phone.

507
01:06:50,427 --> 01:06:54,264
We could use a little privacy.

508
01:06:58,644 --> 01:07:04,316
- What's wrong with him?
- What's wrong is you, Tim.

509
01:07:04,483 --> 01:07:09,696
- Two race teams is one too many!
- It doesn't bother Russ Wheeler.

510
01:07:09,863 --> 01:07:16,453
No, with Cole's reputation Wheeler
knows he can bump him all he wants.

511
01:07:16,662 --> 01:07:21,124
l don't see Russ doing anything
like that, neither does NASCAR.

512
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:26,046
It ain't happening then, under
the watchful eyes of you experts!

513
01:07:26,255 --> 01:07:29,132
l tell you what is happening:

514
01:07:29,299 --> 01:07:33,929
Cole's not running good
and now he's got sponsor trouble.

515
01:07:34,096 --> 01:07:36,557
- But you don't?
- No.

516
01:07:36,765 --> 01:07:42,271
But l want to keep the sponsor
and Cole. He made this all happen.

517
01:07:42,437 --> 01:07:45,357
Right!

518
01:07:49,987 --> 01:07:54,283
Were you on the phone with the doc?
Fighting?

519
01:07:54,491 --> 01:07:58,078
She's too busy to talk right now.

520
01:07:58,287 --> 01:08:00,664
Here's your owner, Tim Daland.

521
01:08:00,873 --> 01:08:05,919
Russ ran a great race today.
I'm very pleased.

522
01:08:06,128 --> 01:08:10,674
102 laps complete, but we're under
caution here at North Wilkesboro.

523
01:08:10,883 --> 01:08:17,389
- Cole hasn't seen Rowdy yet.
- Cole's just like any other driver.

524
01:08:17,598 --> 01:08:21,518
He doesn't want to see Rowdy.

525
01:08:21,685 --> 01:08:26,982
Drivers don't like to be reminded of
what can happen to them out there.

526
01:08:27,149 --> 01:08:33,322
The only time a driver goes to a
funeral is when he's actually dead.

527
01:08:56,303 --> 01:09:01,225
- He's blocking me.
- That's right.

528
01:09:01,475 --> 01:09:05,354
Move the son of a bitch!

529
01:09:57,865 --> 01:09:59,575
Son of a bitch!

530
01:09:59,741 --> 01:10:05,289
Trickle at the bottom of the track
with both right-side tires flat.

531
01:10:05,455 --> 01:10:09,293
Wheeler takes the chequered flag.

532
01:10:15,007 --> 01:10:20,596
Wheeler doesn't deserve to win.
That's low-down shit-assed racing.

533
01:10:20,762 --> 01:10:23,932
It's just racing. Cole overreacted.

534
01:10:31,356 --> 01:10:36,820
- Change my tires.
- l don't know what for. It's over.

535
01:11:09,269 --> 01:11:13,816
There seems to be a little post-race
activity just outside the pit lane.

536
01:11:13,982 --> 01:11:17,569
You shit!

537
01:11:17,736 --> 01:11:22,950
He's destroyed both my cars!

538
01:11:23,116 --> 01:11:28,413
He's fired! You're all fired!

539
01:11:42,886 --> 01:11:49,059
- Are you heading off to Daytona?
- Where are you going from here?

540
01:11:49,226 --> 01:11:54,982
I'll take you to the airport.
I'll catch a flight to Charlotte.

541
01:11:57,234 --> 01:12:03,240
- You want me to come with you?
- What about the hospital?

542
01:12:04,074 --> 01:12:09,830
We could try to see Rowdy.

543
01:12:11,874 --> 01:12:17,087
- Is there anything wrong with that?
- Of course not.

544
01:12:17,254 --> 01:12:20,757
- l guess l forgot about that.
- Yeah, l know.

545
01:12:34,897 --> 01:12:37,816
Let me out of the car.

546
01:12:39,902 --> 01:12:41,945
Let me out.

547
01:12:47,201 --> 01:12:52,789
- Let me out or I'm getting out.
- Hey!

548
01:12:54,541 --> 01:12:58,045
Claire! Wait.

549
01:12:58,212 --> 01:13:03,342
- Get away or I'll call the police.
- I'm not leaving until we talk.

550
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:07,221
- I've got nothing to say.
- Well l do!

551
01:13:10,849 --> 01:13:12,976
That's it? Fine.

552
01:13:13,185 --> 01:13:17,314
You shouldn't be driving a car,
not on a road or a racetrack.

553
01:13:17,481 --> 01:13:22,027
You're selfish, you're crazy
and you're scared.

554
01:13:22,236 --> 01:13:25,656
You and Rowdy have a sickness.
It's called denial.

555
01:13:25,864 --> 01:13:30,035
And it's probably
going to kill you both.

556
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:37,084
You want to control something
that's out of control, right?

557
01:13:37,251 --> 01:13:41,797
I'm going to let you in on a secret
that most other people know.

558
01:13:42,005 --> 01:13:46,552
Control is an illusion. Nobody knows
what's going to happen next.

559
01:13:46,718 --> 01:13:49,012
Not on a freeway, -

560
01:13:49,179 --> 01:13:53,809
- and certainly not on a racetrack
with 40 other infantile egomaniacs.

561
01:13:54,017 --> 01:13:59,148
Nobody controls anything. You've had
a glimpse of that and you're scared.

562
01:13:59,356 --> 01:14:04,319
You might not have the courage
to race anymore.

563
01:14:06,655 --> 01:14:10,492
l hate you for this.
You make me sound like a doctor.

564
01:15:05,756 --> 01:15:08,926
Jennie ...

565
01:15:09,134 --> 01:15:12,221
Why are you here?

566
01:15:13,263 --> 01:15:16,767
Where is he?

567
01:15:27,236 --> 01:15:31,490
- l hear you're out of a job.
- Yeah.

568
01:15:35,452 --> 01:15:39,206
You're not looking too good.

569
01:15:39,373 --> 01:15:43,544
- How many of these do you take?
- What did you come here for?.

570
01:15:47,339 --> 01:15:50,676
To take you to the hospital.

571
01:15:52,678 --> 01:15:56,765
lf it wasn't for that woman doctor,
I'd be back on the track.

572
01:15:56,932 --> 01:16:00,769
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

573
01:16:00,978 --> 01:16:07,234
I've raced with my legs broken,
heart bruised and eyes popping out.

574
01:16:08,652 --> 01:16:13,824
This is going to go away.
I'm going to live forever, -

575
01:16:14,074 --> 01:16:19,663
- unless l go to some damn hospital
where you just lay down and die.

576
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:28,130
What did you win this for?.
This one right here.

577
01:16:29,631 --> 01:16:35,888
- Doesn't it say?.
- Yeah, it's the Winston Cup.

578
01:16:36,096 --> 01:16:41,393
What's your name?
Or has that slipped your mind, too?

579
01:16:42,895 --> 01:16:46,482
- Screw you, man.
- Okay.

580
01:16:46,648 --> 01:16:52,404
We can go down there and fix your
head or we can fix it right here!

581
01:16:57,159 --> 01:17:00,746
Rowdy would like to see you.

582
01:17:05,792 --> 01:17:09,129
- How is he?
- He's okay.

583
01:17:09,338 --> 01:17:13,008
- How are you?
- Good.

584
01:17:13,175 --> 01:17:17,012
- Will he make Daytona?
- He'll make it out of the hospital.

585
01:17:17,179 --> 01:17:22,226
But he'll never
drive a race car again.

586
01:17:27,689 --> 01:17:31,819
This is Dr Wilhaire.
He's going to be doing the surgery.

587
01:17:31,985 --> 01:17:34,446
Cole Trickle.

588
01:17:34,613 --> 01:17:36,990
How is he?

589
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:41,912
The doc says
l need minor brain surgery.

590
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:47,292
Any surgery on his brain
is bound to be minor.

591
01:17:47,501 --> 01:17:52,840
- Can l talk to this guy a second?
- Of course.

592
01:18:03,183 --> 01:18:06,436
A blood vessel in my brain busted.

593
01:18:06,603 --> 01:18:12,526
They want to drill a hole in my head
and get rid of the blood.

594
01:18:15,863 --> 01:18:17,489
- Should l let them do it?
- Yeah.

595
01:18:17,656 --> 01:18:21,869
- You'd let them if it was you?
- l would.

596
01:18:22,077 --> 01:18:28,250
Then I've got to ask you to do
something for me.

597
01:18:28,417 --> 01:18:31,753
- Drive my car.
- What?

598
01:18:31,962 --> 01:18:35,132
Daytona.

599
01:18:36,633 --> 01:18:40,471
You've got plenty of time
to get ready for Daytona.

600
01:18:42,389 --> 01:18:50,105
l lost my sponsor. They're not sure
I'm going to come out of this deal.

601
01:18:50,314 --> 01:18:53,484
Are you?

602
01:18:55,152 --> 01:18:59,239
I've got a lot of land
and a lot of plans l ain't paid for.

603
01:18:59,406 --> 01:19:04,203
So to get my sponsor back,
my car has to run good at Daytona.

604
01:19:04,411 --> 01:19:08,165
All that network TV shit.

605
01:19:08,373 --> 01:19:13,962
- There's plenty of other drivers.
- Don't give me that shit.

606
01:19:14,171 --> 01:19:17,674
My car has to be in the top five, -

607
01:19:17,883 --> 01:19:22,346
- before my sponsors
will pick up the tab for the year.

608
01:19:22,554 --> 01:19:27,351
Maybe after Daytona l can drive.

609
01:19:27,518 --> 01:19:34,107
In the meantime, l want the best
for my family, so don't bullshit me.

610
01:19:34,274 --> 01:19:41,406
Is there some other reason why
l ain't good enough to drive for?.

611
01:19:49,581 --> 01:19:52,918
Then you'll do it?

612
01:20:05,347 --> 01:20:08,600
Shit, man! You had me going.

613
01:20:10,269 --> 01:20:14,356
Let's get down to business.
What's your deal with Daland?

614
01:20:17,693 --> 01:20:22,823
l haven't worked it out.
Excuse me for a second.

615
01:20:26,493 --> 01:20:30,873
- Cole, what's wrong?
- Tell Rowdy I'll call him.

616
01:20:47,514 --> 01:20:53,437
No, sir! Can't use 'em.
Don't want 'em. Can't afford 'em.

617
01:20:53,604 --> 01:20:58,901
- What are you talking about?
- Race car drivers. You and Rowdy.

618
01:20:59,067 --> 01:21:03,155
l ain't setting up that car
for Daytona.

619
01:21:03,322 --> 01:21:08,702
But come on in. We'll bring out the
moonshine and start telling lies.

620
01:21:08,869 --> 01:21:14,958
- But no talk about racing.
- All right, no talk about racing.

621
01:21:15,167 --> 01:21:18,837
I'll race your ass.

622
01:21:29,556 --> 01:21:33,560
I'm going to take off.
Good night, Harry.

623
01:21:46,615 --> 01:21:50,285
Why won't you set up the car?.

624
01:21:54,039 --> 01:21:58,669
Ever since you and Rowdy
crashed at Daytona -

625
01:21:58,836 --> 01:22:03,549
- you've been waiting on something
bad to happen to you.

626
01:22:03,715 --> 01:22:09,221
Just like Buddy Bretherton.
He started hearing voices.

627
01:22:09,388 --> 01:22:12,391
All of them saying one thing:

628
01:22:12,558 --> 01:22:16,854
''Get out of that race car.''

629
01:22:21,942 --> 01:22:25,779
You pegged the engine at Atlanta
and blew it sky-high.

630
01:22:25,988 --> 01:22:30,617
It was deliberate.

631
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:36,248
9,400 rpm
according to the telltale button.

632
01:22:37,875 --> 01:22:41,461
You thought if you didn't get out
of that car you'd die.

633
01:22:41,670 --> 01:22:45,174
Now call me a liar.

634
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:49,636
- You're not lying.
- What are we talking about then?

635
01:22:49,803 --> 01:22:54,766
Racing Rowdy's car at Daytona.
l can't do it without you.

636
01:22:54,933 --> 01:22:59,021
You can't do it period.

637
01:22:59,188 --> 01:23:03,317
l ain't going back there, Cole.

638
01:23:13,494 --> 01:23:16,914
Buddy didn't die of a heart attack.

639
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:20,918
Buddy didn't die of a heart attack.

640
01:23:21,084 --> 01:23:25,797
No, he didn't, but you don't
want to hear about it.

641
01:23:27,132 --> 01:23:34,181
NASCAR privately claimed
that your car is what killed Buddy.

642
01:23:35,641 --> 01:23:40,270
You used thin-walled tubing
to keep the weight down.

643
01:23:40,437 --> 01:23:43,857
- Carbon monoxide knocked Buddy out.
- Horseshit.

644
01:23:44,066 --> 01:23:50,781
When Buddy hit the wall, he was
talking as fast as he was driving.

645
01:23:50,989 --> 01:23:57,079
That was the loudest-talking
unconscious man you ever heard.

646
01:23:57,287 --> 01:24:02,084
Why didn't you let them investigate?

647
01:24:02,251 --> 01:24:06,964
Because l should have known better
than to let him drive.

648
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:12,386
Buddy was a terrible
pain in the ass.

649
01:24:12,553 --> 01:24:18,392
He thought he knew about cars, which
made him twice as ignorant as you.

650
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:22,521
Still ...

651
01:24:27,276 --> 01:24:30,362
Guys like Buddy ...

652
01:24:30,529 --> 01:24:34,575
I've seen him do things in my car
that are unbelievable.

653
01:24:34,783 --> 01:24:38,370
He showed me what l had done.

654
01:24:38,537 --> 01:24:43,000
Then you automatically
have to sort of love the guy ...

655
01:24:43,208 --> 01:24:46,795
... whether you want to or not.

656
01:24:47,004 --> 01:24:50,591
Buddy Bretherton.

657
01:24:50,799 --> 01:24:54,470
l have to ask you something.

658
01:24:56,722 --> 01:25:03,145
Before Buddy hit the wall,
how was he doing in that race?

659
01:25:03,312 --> 01:25:06,732
You ornery, no good ...

660
01:25:08,192 --> 01:25:11,945
You stay out of that car.

661
01:25:12,112 --> 01:25:16,492
lf you get back in that car,
you'll die. You hear?.

662
01:25:20,370 --> 01:25:24,666
I'm not getting back in my car,
I'm getting in Rowdy's.

663
01:25:24,875 --> 01:25:27,544
You dumb drivers.

664
01:25:27,711 --> 01:25:31,924
You think you'll hide
from your bad luck in his car?.

665
01:25:32,090 --> 01:25:36,303
He'd crash you tomorrow
to win the race!

666
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:40,390
- He's no particular friend, so why?.
- He asked me to.

667
01:25:40,599 --> 01:25:46,021
- You just want to race again.
- And so do you.

668
01:25:46,188 --> 01:25:49,858
Well, you're scared.

669
01:25:50,025 --> 01:25:53,445
Yeah, and so are you.

670
01:25:54,154 --> 01:25:57,324
Yeah.

671
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:07,793
What?

672
01:26:09,545 --> 01:26:13,215
l need this, Harry.

673
01:26:15,425 --> 01:26:18,846
l don't have anything else.

674
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:23,934
You've given me a life.

675
01:26:25,644 --> 01:26:28,897
l don't want to lose it.

676
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:37,030
Put me in that car. Let me be the
one to show you what you've done.

677
01:26:37,197 --> 01:26:40,200
Just trust me.

678
01:26:44,079 --> 01:26:49,585
Let me drive.
l won't make a fool out of you.

679
01:26:59,803 --> 01:27:07,019
l ... honestly don't know
how this deal's going to turn out.

680
01:27:09,563 --> 01:27:13,233
Neither do l, Harry.

681
01:27:36,215 --> 01:27:42,387
I'm setting up for cool weather.
lf the sun breaks, you'll run loose.

682
01:27:42,596 --> 01:27:48,185
Cole's not ready for that.
He's changed.

683
01:27:48,352 --> 01:27:52,272
You cannot get out of control.

684
01:27:52,481 --> 01:27:56,652
He's liable to hurt you
and you're liable to hurt him.

685
01:27:56,819 --> 01:27:59,988
l couldn't handle that.

686
01:28:00,197 --> 01:28:04,284
You've got to take care of him.
All right?

687
01:28:04,451 --> 01:28:07,788
You've got to take care of him.

688
01:28:17,756 --> 01:28:22,052
This is not the kind of answer
I'm looking for from you.

689
01:28:27,724 --> 01:28:31,478
Daytona is a tough racetrack.

690
01:28:31,645 --> 01:28:36,692
We're going to keep an eye on Cole
to see if he has all his reflexes.

691
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:43,240
l don't think that the accident
will affect the way Cole performs.

692
01:28:43,448 --> 01:28:46,952
l hope l beat him.

693
01:28:47,161 --> 01:28:51,290
A lot of guys don't like him.
The guy's got a lot of talent.

694
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:54,001
He just wants to win.

695
01:28:54,168 --> 01:28:59,131
He's been a danger to himself
and to other drivers.

696
01:28:59,298 --> 01:29:04,720
lf he comes near me,
I'm going to put him in the wall.

697
01:29:04,887 --> 01:29:08,640
l only expect to see him
in my rear-view mirror.

698
01:29:31,622 --> 01:29:34,500
Come in.

699
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:43,467
Harry said you wouldn't mind
if l stopped by.

700
01:29:49,681 --> 01:29:54,645
- How's Rowdy?.
- He's getting better every day.

701
01:29:54,812 --> 01:29:59,858
Especially since you said you were
looking forward to racing his car.

702
01:30:00,067 --> 01:30:03,487
So l lied.

703
01:30:03,654 --> 01:30:08,534
- What are you thinking?
- 'What's he thinking?''

704
01:30:12,371 --> 01:30:18,961
Everybody's the same. You've got to
be good at your job to enjoy life.

705
01:30:19,169 --> 01:30:21,922
This is my job.

706
01:30:22,089 --> 01:30:25,592
It's all l know.

707
01:30:30,681 --> 01:30:35,185
You know l can't watch you do this.

708
01:30:35,394 --> 01:30:38,272
Claire ...

709
01:30:38,397 --> 01:30:44,403
I'm more afraid of being nothing
than l am of being hurt.

710
01:30:47,114 --> 01:30:50,367
Walk me in?

711
01:30:52,661 --> 01:30:57,291
Welcome to the Daytona 500,
the Superbowl of motor racing.

712
01:30:57,457 --> 01:31:04,256
Among today's favorites has
to be Wheeler in the Hardee's car.

713
01:31:04,423 --> 01:31:09,052
He's the man to watch, after
winning the pole for today's event.

714
01:31:09,261 --> 01:31:12,431
But don't count out Cole Trickle.

715
01:31:12,598 --> 01:31:17,978
He's returning to Daytona for
the first time since his accident.

716
01:31:19,771 --> 01:31:22,774
l heard you didn't have a sponsor.

717
01:31:22,941 --> 01:31:28,697
They gave us just enough money
to put their name on the car.

718
01:31:33,410 --> 01:31:37,080
- Tim.
- Cole.

719
01:31:46,340 --> 01:31:49,343
Why is the hood up?
What's wrong?

720
01:31:49,510 --> 01:31:55,265
We had to change engines.
We forgot to tighten the oil line.

721
01:31:55,432 --> 01:32:01,063
- Why did you change engines?
- There was metal in the oil filter.

722
01:32:01,230 --> 01:32:04,650
- Where did you get the engine?
- We stole it.

723
01:32:10,405 --> 01:32:17,246
Claire, put the boy in his car
before he starts sweating.

724
01:32:34,388 --> 01:32:38,934
So, are you going to get in your car
and take off?

725
01:32:41,645 --> 01:32:45,315
Drive carefully.

726
01:33:14,303 --> 01:33:17,014
Gentlemen, start your engines.

727
01:33:32,362 --> 01:33:36,366
We are underway.
The Daytona 500 is on.

728
01:33:45,417 --> 01:33:51,089
We are 56 laps into the 200-lap
event and Wheeler is in the lead.

729
01:33:54,218 --> 01:33:56,094
You're 47:01 . The leader's 45:90.
You're running last.

730
01:34:00,349 --> 01:34:04,895
What's going on, Cole?

731
01:34:07,147 --> 01:34:10,317
Are you all right?

732
01:34:15,656 --> 01:34:20,118
Just past the halfway mark
and Wheeler still leads.

733
01:34:32,256 --> 01:34:36,885
There's a crash at turn three.
Oil at the bottom of the track.

734
01:34:40,180 --> 01:34:44,560
Cars are sliding down
from the top of the track.

735
01:34:44,768 --> 01:34:48,981
You'd better go high.
Pick a line you can drive through.

736
01:34:51,650 --> 01:34:56,530
Cole, are you all right?
Answer me, please.

737
01:34:58,240 --> 01:35:02,161
Go around those wrecks.
You can drive through it.

738
01:35:02,369 --> 01:35:06,498
l know it in my heart.

739
01:35:19,136 --> 01:35:21,597
I'm through it, Harry!

740
01:35:23,682 --> 01:35:27,102
I'm out of here.

741
01:35:34,735 --> 01:35:37,654
Cole's moved up to ninth.

742
01:35:39,114 --> 01:35:44,870
Wheeler continues to lead, but the
man on the move is Cole Trickle.

743
01:35:51,168 --> 01:35:54,505
I'm going to make a hole
to get through here.

744
01:36:00,552 --> 01:36:03,472
Here we go.

745
01:36:12,147 --> 01:36:15,818
Wheeler knocked me into Ganz.
Ganz spun out.

746
01:36:21,031 --> 01:36:25,577
He's going high.
Goddamn it!

747
01:36:25,786 --> 01:36:29,206
Trickle takes the lead.

748
01:36:29,414 --> 01:36:32,835
Go, Cole.

749
01:36:35,045 --> 01:36:38,382
This is what it's all about.

750
01:36:40,300 --> 01:36:44,680
With 23 laps to go,
Cole Trickle is leading.

751
01:36:44,888 --> 01:36:48,392
- Take him now, Russ.
- He's all mine.

752
01:37:00,988 --> 01:37:03,991
The accelerator is stuck.

753
01:37:06,410 --> 01:37:09,288
l can't slow down.

754
01:37:09,454 --> 01:37:14,418
Step on the clutch
and let the son of a bitch blow it.

755
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:20,507
Son of a ...

756
01:37:28,724 --> 01:37:34,897
The accelerator is fixed,
but the transmission is screwed.

757
01:37:49,786 --> 01:37:53,457
- Are they out of the race?
- They will be.

758
01:37:53,582 --> 01:37:58,045
Get me out in front of the pace car
or the race is over for us!

759
01:37:58,253 --> 01:38:03,759
- The linkage is all twisted.
- Just give him the high gear.

760
01:38:03,926 --> 01:38:09,223
- I've got it.
- Let's go.

761
01:38:09,389 --> 01:38:12,893
- Come on.
- Go! Go! Go!

762
01:38:13,101 --> 01:38:16,188
Get out there and help them!

763
01:38:26,114 --> 01:38:31,078
- We made it. Good work.
- l owe you one.

764
01:38:32,663 --> 01:38:35,207
That's not your car.

765
01:38:35,374 --> 01:38:38,961
It's my engine in that car and
that's what my boys are pushing.

766
01:38:42,548 --> 01:38:47,261
You've got to be at top speed
when the green flag drops.

767
01:38:50,681 --> 01:38:54,434
The green flag is out
and racing resumes.

768
01:38:54,643 --> 01:38:57,980
Wheeler's still in the lead.

769
01:39:02,526 --> 01:39:06,530
- Where am l?
- Ninth. Eight laps to go.

770
01:39:12,536 --> 01:39:17,332
- Am l gaining on Wheeler?.
- Trickle's moving up fast.

771
01:39:27,259 --> 01:39:29,636
Remember me?

772
01:39:35,559 --> 01:39:40,522
I'm going to draught Wheeler,
make him pull me around.

773
01:39:42,232 --> 01:39:45,569
He's on my ass.

774
01:39:47,946 --> 01:39:51,992
He's going on the outside.
I'm going to put him in the wall.

775
01:40:01,376 --> 01:40:04,463
I'm setting him up, Harry.

776
01:40:04,630 --> 01:40:09,426
There's the white flag.
One lap to go.

777
01:40:22,105 --> 01:40:27,945
- Don't keep this up, Cole, please.
- This guy's going down!

778
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:37,329
Last turn, Russ.
He'll try and slingshot past you.

779
01:40:37,496 --> 01:40:41,583
l know Cole.
He always goes to the outside.

780
01:40:41,750 --> 01:40:44,837
This one's for you, Harry.

781
01:40:45,796 --> 01:40:48,590
He's going high.

782
01:40:51,343 --> 01:40:54,138
He's going low!

783
01:40:54,304 --> 01:40:57,307
Son of a bitch!

784
01:41:00,602 --> 01:41:05,941
Here comes the finish line,
and Cole Trickle takes the win!

785
01:41:45,731 --> 01:41:50,027
- You weren't going to watch.
- l lied.

786
01:41:55,365 --> 01:41:59,036
- Where's Harry?.
- l don't know.

787
01:42:08,086 --> 01:42:10,631
Harry ...

788
01:42:12,633 --> 01:42:18,889
- Say something, will you?
- l really can't.

789
01:42:22,935 --> 01:42:26,688
You didn't know
how this was going to turn out.

790
01:42:26,855 --> 01:42:33,821
It's like you said: There's
nothing you can't do in a race car.

791
01:42:35,364 --> 01:42:39,368
- We won.
- Yeah.

792
01:42:39,535 --> 01:42:44,665
Can you walk,
or am l going to have to carry you?

793
01:42:44,873 --> 01:42:47,084
Where to?

794
01:42:47,292 --> 01:42:51,130
- Victory Lane.
- Oh yeah.

795
01:42:52,714 --> 01:42:55,676
Walk?. Hell ...

796
01:42:58,095 --> 01:43:01,682
I'll race your ass!
