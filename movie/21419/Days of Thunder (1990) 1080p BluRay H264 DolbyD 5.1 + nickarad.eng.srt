1
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:15,637
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Daytona 500,</i>

2
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,972
<i>the Super Bowl of motor racing events.</i>

3
00:02:18,056 --> 00:02:19,932
<i>Walking onto the grid is the two-time</i>

4
00:02:20,016 --> 00:02:23,144
<i>Daytona 500 and defending champion
Rowdy Burns.</i>

5
00:02:24,354 --> 00:02:28,650
<i>And perennial contender from Reading,
Pennsylvania, Aldo Bennedetti.</i>

6
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,962
<i>Gentlemen, start your engines.</i>

7
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:35,466
<i>Big turn back for
number 43, Richard Petty.</i>

8
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,802
<i>Petty spins to the inside of the track.</i>

9
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:39,595
<i>A tough break for Richard Petty.</i>

10
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:42,306
<i>Richard Petty is out of the Daytona 500.</i>

11
00:03:43,516 --> 00:03:44,784
<i>Speaking of people
who are out of the race,</i>

12
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:47,729
<i>perhaps it's time to remember
the legendary crew chief, Harry Hogge,</i>

13
00:03:47,812 --> 00:03:51,566
<i>whose great driver, Buddy Bretherton,
died here last year in a fiery crash,</i>

14
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:55,111
<i>hitting the wall at over
195 miles an hour.</i>

15
00:03:57,572 --> 00:04:00,533
So you're enjoying the good life, Harry?
Yeah.

16
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:03,661
I never minded spreading a little
fertilizer around now and then.

17
00:04:03,745 --> 00:04:05,413
There's worse things.

18
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:08,124
How's the truck running?
Runs good.

19
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:13,212
I want you to build me a car.

20
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:22,221
Now, Tim, everybody knows
some downtown car dealer

21
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:23,723
can't afford a race team.

22
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:26,768
No driver worth a damn
is gonna sign with you.

23
00:04:26,851 --> 00:04:29,604
'Cause they wreck one car,
you can't afford to build them another

24
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:31,230
and they're out of the deal, you know.

25
00:04:31,314 --> 00:04:34,066
And no car's gonna win without a driver.

26
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,777
Not even mine.

27
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,030
If you built the car,
I'd get a damn driver.

28
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,621
What kind of driver are you going to
find after the season's started?

29
00:04:46,704 --> 00:04:51,125
Some old boy who's washed up
and wasn't worth a shit to begin with.

30
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:52,794
You can work with him.

31
00:04:52,877 --> 00:04:55,338
You can build a driver
like you build a car, Harry.

32
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:57,089
Tim, take a look at that hound.

33
00:04:57,173 --> 00:04:59,634
That's the best coon dog
I've ever seen or heard about.

34
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:03,387
And I didn't teach him a damn thing.
well, I got somebody.

35
00:05:03,471 --> 00:05:05,848
Who?
Take a look at him.

36
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:08,726
Anybody I gotta take a look at,
ain't somebody.

37
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,937
Then take a look at nobody.

38
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:17,151
Look, Tim, I gave up racing.
You gotta know that. All right?

39
00:05:17,235 --> 00:05:19,278
You didn't give up racing, Harry.

40
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:22,949
You quit to avoid an investigation
into Buddy's crash at Daytona.

41
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:26,202
Hey, I didn't avoid
any goddamn investigation.

42
00:05:27,912 --> 00:05:30,498
Anyway, I talked to NASCAR

43
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,917
and if you come back in
there won't be any investigation.

44
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,336
How the hell did you sell them
on that deal?

45
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:36,879
I'm a hell of a salesman.

46
00:05:41,968 --> 00:05:44,262
Now, that's a race-car driver.

47
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:48,850
When's your driver due?

48
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,481
Harry tells me your guy runs
those Indy type deals.

49
00:05:55,565 --> 00:05:57,024
Yeah. Sprints, mainly.

50
00:05:57,108 --> 00:06:00,486
Two World of Outlaw championships,
three all-star wins,

51
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,531
seven straight feature wins
and he's been driving ASA.

52
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:04,657
Hey.

53
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,803
Got yourself a real statistician there.
Does he know anything about drivers?

54
00:06:08,828 --> 00:06:10,288
We'll see.

55
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:19,589
Harry, where'd you say
your driver's from?

56
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:21,090
Eagle Rock.

57
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:24,760
It's up around Wilkesboro, isn't it?

58
00:06:24,844 --> 00:06:26,929
No. Glendale, California.

59
00:06:27,013 --> 00:06:28,222
He's a Yankee?

60
00:06:28,306 --> 00:06:31,809
Not exactly. If you're from California,
you're not a Yankee.

61
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:34,020
You're not really anything.

62
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:36,105
You said it.

63
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:53,998
The shocks are right,
we're dialed in, buddy.

64
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,958
Don't change a thing.

65
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:01,589
Hey, you ain't buried in
horse manure after all.

66
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:05,092
Looking pretty good.
You're the one who's looking good.

67
00:07:05,176 --> 00:07:08,387
It hadn't been easy, Harry,
I'll guran-damn-tee you,

68
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:10,389
but this bitch is ready to run.

69
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:12,183
I can't tell you how much
we all appreciate

70
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:14,769
you letting us use the car, Rowdy.

71
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,606
I told you about this, Rowdy.

72
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:19,774
Harry's got some new driver

73
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:21,777
and he needs a car
just to turn a couple of laps.

74
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:26,197
I told you it was Harry Hogge who'd
asked us personally, as a favor.

75
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:32,536
Who is this driver?

76
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:07,154
Tim tells me you've been
running open-wheels.

77
00:08:07,947 --> 00:08:09,115
That's right.

78
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:12,118
And now you just want to
up and drive NASCAR?

79
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:14,036
That's right.

80
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,080
What do you know about
stock car racing?

81
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:19,458
Well, I've watched it
on television, of course.

82
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:22,211
You've seen it on television?

83
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:24,296
ESPN, the coverage is excellent.

84
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,424
You'd be surprised
at how much you can pick up.

85
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,426
I'm sure I would.

86
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:32,263
Look, this may not be the best time
for you to run this car.

87
00:08:32,722 --> 00:08:34,640
Was there some problem?

88
00:08:35,975 --> 00:08:37,893
No, sir. You all go right ahead.

89
00:08:37,977 --> 00:08:39,662
But you bend this bitch
the least little bit,

90
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:42,106
I'm gonna tear your balls off.

91
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:54,869
Okay. Would you mind very much
holding on to this?

92
00:08:56,287 --> 00:08:58,789
Didn't he hear what that man said?

93
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:05,212
Hold on a minute.
Don't you think we ought to talk?

94
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:08,049
What? About how I'm gonna run? Sure.

95
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:10,926
About how you've managed
to live as long as you have.

96
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,929
Look, I ain't gonna let you race this car.

97
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:26,067
What's going on?
He's had second thoughts.

98
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,652
You said you'd look at him.
I've looked at him.

99
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:31,405
I paid $2,500 to use
this track today, Harry.

100
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:34,742
Forget it. He needs a brand name
like Exxon or Richard Petty.

101
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:37,912
Well, I know a damn race driver
when I see one.

102
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,958
What's going on, Harry?
Is this happening or what?

103
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:45,252
Do us all a favor, Harry.

104
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:55,721
Let me drive.
I won't make a fool out of you.

105
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,148
That tunnel turn's real tricky.

106
00:10:06,232 --> 00:10:08,776
Now, whether it's hot or cold,
it gets as slick as a butt.

107
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:12,363
Then you'll slip and slide and slam
yourself into the wall before you know it.

108
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,240
So just take it easy.

109
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:28,045
I'm dropping the hammer.
No, you're not.

110
00:11:02,288 --> 00:11:03,998
It's under Rowdy's time.

111
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:07,751
Well, it might have been better
if he cracked up the car.

112
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:24,977
That was fast.
Yeah?

113
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:27,062
Thirty-one flat.

114
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:30,858
That's good enough to take the pole
in the last race here.

115
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:36,322
Hell, I thought this was gonna be a joke.

116
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:39,325
You never drove a stock car before?
No, sprints mainly.

117
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:41,702
What's your name?
Buck Bretherton. What's yours?

118
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:43,954
Cole Trickle.
It's damn nice to meet you, Buck.

119
00:11:44,038 --> 00:11:46,373
Damn nice to meet you, too, Cole.

120
00:11:46,457 --> 00:11:48,559
You were one lucky son of a bitch
in that tunnel turn.

121
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:50,211
That car was way out of shape.

122
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:53,547
Well, if you think it was luck,
let's do it again.

123
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,717
You run good.
Thank you.

124
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,721
Now, go get your own car
and we'll see how you do in a crowd.

125
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:06,227
So, how come you don't stick
to open wheels?

126
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,103
I lost my ride.

127
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:12,483
After two championships
and seven straight wins, you were fired?

128
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:14,151
I lost my ride.

129
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,654
Doesn't matter. I'd have quit regardless.

130
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:19,406
Why's that?
I wasn't going anywhere.

131
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,326
Where do you want to go?
Indianapolis.

132
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,377
But you can't win in Indy
without a great car.

133
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:26,852
And my name's not Andretti or Unser.

134
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:29,308
On the other hand, stock cars
are stock cars. Pretty much the same.

135
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,336
Hey, there's nothing stock
about a stock car.

136
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,256
Look, I'm not trying to insult you.

137
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,841
All I'm saying is,
stock cars are built to run equal.

138
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:40,344
Isn't that right?
So the rule books say.

139
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,696
So I don't have to worry
about getting beat by another car.

140
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:43,864
In other words,
all you have to worry about

141
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:46,725
is getting beat by other drivers.
Yeah.

142
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:50,646
You build me a car,
and I'll win Daytona next year.

143
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:59,822
I'm gonna give you an engine
low to the ground.

144
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:04,618
Extra-big oil pan
that'll cut the wind from underneath you.

145
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:09,081
That'll give you 30 to 40
more horsepower.

146
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:15,796
I'm gonna give you a fuel line
that'll hold an extra gallon of gas.

147
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:20,301
I'm gonna shave half an inch off you
and shape you like a bullet.

148
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:23,721
And when we get you primed,
painted and weighed,

149
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:28,309
you're going to be ready to go out
on that racetrack. You hear me?

150
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:33,397
You're gonna be perfect.

151
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,473
Okay.
I'm going to pull this rookie's chain.

152
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:56,605
Cole, you're wandering
all over the track.

153
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:59,149
Yeah. Well, that son of a bitch
just slammed into me.

154
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:02,069
No, he didn't slam into you,
he didn't bump you, he didn't nudge you.

155
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:05,155
He rubbed you,
and rubbing, son, is racing.

156
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:16,417
There goes the fender.

157
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:20,838
There goes the quarter panel.

158
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:44,528
All right. Get back!

159
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:52,703
All right,
while we're still under a caution,

160
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:56,248
I want you to go back out on that track
and hit the pace car.

161
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:59,168
Hit the pace car?
Hit the pace car!

162
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:00,544
What for?

163
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,838
Because you hit every other
goddamn thing out there.

164
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:06,258
I want you to be perfect. Now, go on.
Go! Go! Go!

165
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:24,443
You're going too high. Stay in the group.

166
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:49,343
How about that?
This side we don't have to fix.

167
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:55,516
I don't want you spoiled, Buck.

168
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:14,117
This is gonna hurt.

169
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:16,203
Move! Move! Move!

170
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:21,208
Did you see that guy?

171
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:35,681
I've got to pit.

172
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:37,641
I don't think so. We're busy now.

173
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:41,645
You're what?
We're eating ice cream.

174
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:43,313
Ice cream?

175
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:55,968
Now, you're welcome to
come on and get one,

176
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:57,033
but I don't believe NASCAR

177
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:59,513
would think much of you trying to eat
an ice cream cone out there.

178
00:17:59,538 --> 00:18:01,778
You have enough trouble
riding around the track as it is.

179
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,474
Take it easy.

180
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:22,644
Come on now, Cole!

181
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:24,938
Cole! Cole!

182
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:34,323
We messed up big-time on Sunday.

183
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:37,242
I had sponsors in the stands

184
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:39,536
and I'm hugging and holding hands

185
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,832
and kissing them in the ear
and praying for a good showing.

186
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:45,834
And what do we do?

187
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:49,713
We end up looking like
a monkey fucking a football out there.

188
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:53,175
Everybody out, please.

189
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:56,219
Except you two.

190
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:06,146
I've got a question.

191
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:10,359
What is the one thing you absolutely
need to do to win a race?

192
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:13,111
It's pretty damn obvious...
You keep quiet!

193
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:15,405
You need to finish the race.

194
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:19,159
Tim, I realize Harry's been around
a long time.

195
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:21,845
I'm not saying that his ways
are antiquated

196
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,556
but it'd help to have a car that handled
properly and didn't blow engines.

197
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:27,141
Well, if he wouldn't get excited
and over rev the son of a bitch,

198
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:29,002
the engine wouldn't blow.

199
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:32,005
Now, Cole, when you shift the gear,

200
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:34,216
and that little needle on the tach
goes into the red

201
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:38,470
and reads 9,000 rpm, that's bad.

202
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:43,892
It's also my fault if the tires blow,
if you ask this old fart.

203
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:45,243
Well, hell yes, it's your fault.

204
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:46,978
There's 40 other vultures out there

205
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:49,064
who managed to finish the race
on their tires.

206
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:51,983
You see Darrell Waltrip
using up his tires?

207
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:53,747
There's nothing I can't do
with a race-car.

208
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,212
Well, that's the difference
between you and me.

209
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:57,489
There's only so much I can do!
That's obvious.

210
00:19:57,614 --> 00:20:00,409
Harry, he doesn't need to appreciate
your job to do his.

211
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:02,577
Well, he sure as hell does.
How can he expect to race

212
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:05,539
if he don't know what a race-car
can and can't do?

213
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:06,832
What is this shit, huh?

214
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:09,418
You want me to work the pit
and you drive?

215
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:11,378
Fine. We'll try that.

216
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,798
I can't talk to this son of a bitch.

217
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:21,430
I can't talk to that son of a bitch.
I really can't. I can't...

218
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:29,396
You think he can drive?
He can drive.

219
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:31,314
He can drive beyond
the limits of the tires,

220
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:33,567
the engine, the car, anything else.

221
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:37,571
If the son of a bitch listened to me,
we wouldn't hardly ever lose a race.

222
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:42,743
If we don't get us a sponsor
in the next couple of races,

223
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:44,578
my ass is fried.

224
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,917
I'm liable to be out of the car business
altogether.

225
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:55,005
And, Harry, I know you're great.
You know you're great.

226
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:58,091
But if the guy in the car
doesn't trust you,

227
00:20:58,175 --> 00:21:00,802
we're never going to win a damn race.

228
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:14,983
Hey, Harry.

229
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:22,949
We've gotta talk, all right?

230
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:26,244
All right, Harry. Talk.

231
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:28,830
No. On the radio during the race.

232
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:31,183
Now, you wanna run right on
the ragged edge all the damn time,

233
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:34,753
you've got to tell us what's going on
with the car.

234
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:36,636
Or you just want to change
the way I drive it.

235
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:37,714
Maybe.

236
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:41,218
Well, maybe you can set up the car
so I don't have to change.

237
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:42,469
I'd be happy to.

238
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:45,222
You just tell me how.
What do you want to know?

239
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:46,932
Well, hell, Cole, you are the driver.

240
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:48,408
You think she's running loose or tight?
Tell us.

241
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:50,435
We give a turn here,
take some wedge out there,

242
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:53,396
we'll win some races.
That's all there is to it.

243
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,982
I can't do that.
Why the hell not?

244
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:59,945
Because I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

245
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:01,905
How do you mean that?

246
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,416
Because I don't know much
about cars, okay?

247
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,960
Well, hey, Cole, that don't make you

248
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:17,045
a damn bit different
from any driver I ever met.

249
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:18,396
No, I mean, I really don't know.

250
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:21,508
I don't know what you just said about
a turn here and a wedge there.

251
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:25,178
I don't know. I don't know.
How can that be?

252
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:26,471
What's the difference?

253
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:30,559
They told me to get in a car and drive.
And I could drive.

254
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:33,186
The point is,
I'd like to help out but I can't.

255
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:36,106
I'm an idiot. I don't have the vocabulary.

256
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:42,904
Well...
Well?

257
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:48,201
We're just gonna have to
figure one out, aren't we?

258
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:53,206
Don't worry about it.

259
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:56,376
All right?

260
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:58,920
How does she feel?

261
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:04,175
Her ass is all over the place.

262
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:08,638
Well, the rear end's loose. Car's fast.

263
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:12,309
<i>"Loose" is fast, and "on the edge,"
you're out of control.</i>

264
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:18,648
Now, Cole, there is something else.

265
00:23:20,901 --> 00:23:23,820
Tyres is what wins a race.

266
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:27,365
Yeah.
What the hell are you talking about?

267
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:30,827
If we can't figure you a way to run
so you don't melt the damn tires,

268
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:32,579
we can't finish a race.

269
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:34,247
So, what do you want?

270
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:35,749
I'll tell you what,

271
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:40,253
you run 50 laps any way you like,
then 50 laps like I want you to.

272
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:43,715
Give me an honest run.
If you do, I'm gonna beat you.

273
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:03,401
All right. Now we're going to do
it 50 laps my way, all right?

274
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:06,112
Now, when you were
racing Indy cars out west,

275
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:10,116
the tires were twice as wide
and the car weighed half as much.

276
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,245
Now your car weighs twice as much
and the tires are half as wide

277
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:16,247
and you're burning them up, all right.

278
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:18,333
Now, if you do...
When you burn them up, they melt,

279
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:21,127
when they melt, they get greasy
and you slip and slide.

280
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:24,214
And you're out of control. All right?

281
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:26,174
Let's go!

282
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,899
His way, my way.

283
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:45,318
I was six seconds faster.

284
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:48,738
You can buy me some lunch
at the highway joint, Tim.

285
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:07,549
What's wrong?
We're trying to figure out what to do.

286
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,178
About what?
About what? We're in trouble.

287
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:14,681
Rowdy took the pole in 30.25.

288
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:17,851
We run 31.10.
We're almost a second off the pace.

289
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:20,687
We're looking for some
speed out of this.

290
00:25:23,064 --> 00:25:25,108
The car's perfect, Harry.

291
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:37,470
<i>It's the first race of the season here</i>

292
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:39,873
<i>at the legendary
Darlington International Speedway.</i>

293
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:42,417
<i>And the most treacherous turn
is number four.</i>

294
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,294
30:90. Leader's 30:80.

295
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:46,880
You're running 12th. Thirty laps to go.

296
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:47,964
Thanks, Harry.

297
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:02,645
You're gonna burn the damn tires,
Cole. So take it easy.

298
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:06,107
Harry, I'm not going faster.
Everybody else is going slower.

299
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:08,777
He's right, Harry.
I checked his lap times.

300
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,988
We just haven't fallen off
as much as everybody else.

301
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:14,132
That's right. You're doing good, Cole.
You're doing real good.

302
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:15,158
<i>You're running fifth</i>

303
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:18,661
<i>and you're gaining half a second
a lap on the leader.</i>

304
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:22,832
Fifteen to go.

305
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:29,255
Don't pass on the outside of turn four.

306
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:35,178
That's right. Stay to the inside, Cole.
Ten laps to go.

307
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:40,683
<i>And Trickle has moved
into the number two spot,</i>

308
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:42,352
<i>right behind Rowdy Burns.</i>

309
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:45,647
I'm right behind the leader.
<i>Five laps</i> to go.

310
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:51,194
Remember me?

311
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:53,530
What in the hell's going on?

312
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:56,866
Just a little rubbing, Harry.
Rubbing's racing.

313
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:06,251
I'm going to take this rookie
once and for all.

314
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:12,382
All right, God damn it. That's enough!

315
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:15,885
You can't play with Rowdy like this.
He's gonna give you a real ass ripping.

316
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:17,178
Just relax, Harry.

317
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:24,561
<i>Somebody's got to give.
And it's Rowdy Burns who's out!</i>

318
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:27,522
<i>No! An incredible recovery by Rowdy.</i>

319
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:30,108
<i>He retains his position on the lead lap.</i>

320
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:31,484
<i>And we have a new leader.</i>

321
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:35,238
<i>Cole Trickle in the number 46
City Chevrolet car.</i>

322
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:38,283
<i>We're under caution
with three laps to go.</i>

323
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:41,703
Caution's out. Come on in.
What for? It's almost over.

324
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:45,415
You've been on the green for 68 laps.
Everybody's got to pit, Cole.

325
00:27:56,092 --> 00:27:57,760
Go, go! Go, go!

326
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:01,681
The air gun's jammed,
give me another one.

327
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:04,604
Give me a gun. Give me a gun.
It's jammed. Come on, switch it, guys.

328
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:07,770
Let's go!

329
00:28:13,818 --> 00:28:17,572
Damn it! Go! Go! Go!
Go. Get them on quick!

330
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:30,126
God damn it! Son of a bitch!

331
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,753
Now, Cole...

332
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:40,386
Son <i>of a bitch!</i>
Cole, we're on the air, all right?

333
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,513
I come into the pit, I'm in first place.

334
00:28:42,597 --> 00:28:44,724
I go out, I'm in third with two laps to go.

335
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:46,927
All right.
First of all, don't get excited, all right.

336
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,395
You're in third place.
That's a pretty respectable position.

337
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:50,563
Now, what you do is this.

338
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:52,774
When they slow down into turn four,

339
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:56,069
you just keep your foot on the gas
and drive right by them on the outside.

340
00:28:56,152 --> 00:29:00,198
Harry, you told me, nobody goes
to the outside on turn four.

341
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:04,911
Well, now I'm telling you different.
If you go to the outside, you can hold it.

342
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:06,412
He's going to end up in the wall.

343
00:29:06,496 --> 00:29:09,082
All right. Cole, the pace car
is about ready to duck on off.

344
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:10,808
We don't have a whole lot of time
to talk about this.

345
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:12,085
Well, tell me how.

346
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:14,462
It's 'cause we've got a real
good set of match tires on.

347
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:16,256
What?
What?

348
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:19,050
Those tires are matched perfect
and staggered special.

349
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:20,802
You're gonna get him killed.

350
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:23,012
Pace car's about ready duck on off.

351
00:29:23,096 --> 00:29:26,099
If you go to the outside, you can hold it.

352
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:28,662
All right, Harry. When it comes
to the car I'll take your word.

353
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:39,112
<i>The white flag is out. One lap to go.</i>

354
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:59,257
The boy don't have the balls
to pass me on the outside.

355
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:04,762
<i>And they're heading
into treacherous turn four.</i>

356
00:30:29,996 --> 00:30:30,997
Yes!

357
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:35,001
<i>And Cole Trickle wins his
first ever NASCAR victory.</i>

358
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:37,628
<i>Second place goes to Rowdy Burns.</i>

359
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,890
Cole Trickle...

360
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:52,076
Cole, did you have any idea you could
run the car wide open into that last turn

361
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:53,603
and make it stick like that?

362
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:55,813
I knew it all along.
How's that?

363
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:59,442
Well, in our last stop, when I came in,
Harry put on special tires.

364
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:01,694
Special tires? Harry Hogge,
what's special about them?

365
00:31:01,778 --> 00:31:03,946
Well, nothing in particular.

366
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:06,986
Looks like Harry Hogge
has a little explaining to do.

367
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:08,659
You told me...

368
00:31:08,743 --> 00:31:10,870
I lied. I had to tell you something
to calm you down.

369
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:12,430
You were acting like such a candy-ass.

370
00:31:12,455 --> 00:31:15,583
After the air gun stuck, I figured
you'd never get back on the racetrack.

371
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:18,169
You son of a bitch!

372
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:25,760
Try this on for size.
We've got ourselves a sponsor.

373
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:31,766
Promise me one thing, boys,

374
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:35,395
whatever else we do from here,
we win Daytona.

375
00:31:35,978 --> 00:31:38,523
That's a promise. That's a promise.

376
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:48,074
Selling thousands of dollars worth
of useless mining stock

377
00:31:48,157 --> 00:31:51,160
and they call that a dog and pony show.

378
00:31:51,244 --> 00:31:55,998
It may be funny, but it's not that funny
when it happens to you, son.

379
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:59,794
It happened to me.

380
00:32:00,503 --> 00:32:03,548
What?
You bought worthless mining stock?

381
00:32:03,673 --> 00:32:05,758
I told you I lost my ride.

382
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:07,927
That's how I lost it.

383
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:11,931
Team owner was a conman.
Junk bonds, worthless companies.

384
00:32:12,849 --> 00:32:15,351
But mainly he sold stolen yachts.

385
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:20,273
When I won enough races, he even
used my name to promote the sales.

386
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:22,942
He went to jail and I lost my ride.

387
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:28,948
It was pretty humiliating, actually.

388
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:32,076
Hell, Cole, there's no need
to be embarrassed

389
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,747
by some lowlife, piece of trash
who put you in that kind of position.

390
00:32:36,873 --> 00:32:39,375
Well, Harry, that depends.
On what?

391
00:32:40,084 --> 00:32:44,338
On whether or not you're related
to that lowlife, piece of trash.

392
00:32:45,882 --> 00:32:47,592
He was my father.

393
00:32:49,385 --> 00:32:52,388
I've never really
stuck with anything since.

394
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:57,935
They don't trust me, I don't trust them.

395
00:32:58,728 --> 00:33:00,730
You know how that goes.

396
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:02,690
Like for instance,

397
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:05,693
you lied to me today.

398
00:33:05,776 --> 00:33:08,696
It was dumb luck
I didn't end up crashed or dead.

399
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:13,117
I ought to punch you out.
Yeah? Give it a try.

400
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,915
No.

401
00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:24,170
Don't wanna get my ass kicked
by a 60-year-old man.

402
00:33:25,254 --> 00:33:26,923
Fifty-nine.

403
00:33:27,006 --> 00:33:29,133
Whoop his ass, Harry.
Come on, Cole.

404
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,015
Oh, God. Come on.

405
00:33:41,229 --> 00:33:44,524
Drivers just don't go to the outside
like that, Cole.

406
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:47,860
But I knew you could do it. I knew it.

407
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:52,114
I believed it in my heart.

408
00:33:56,786 --> 00:33:59,455
Peach or cherry?
Cherry.

409
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:04,794
I'm taking a leak.

410
00:34:06,796 --> 00:34:08,756
There you see now,
there's calculating drivers,

411
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:11,217
and then there's kamikaze drivers.

412
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:14,971
And our Cole here's a kamikaze,
like my pappy was.

413
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:18,182
And who's that?
Buddy Bretherton.

414
00:34:18,266 --> 00:34:20,518
Buddy Bretherton was your dad?

415
00:34:22,645 --> 00:34:25,690
He died at Daytona, didn't he?
Last year.

416
00:34:26,774 --> 00:34:30,194
How did it happen? Mind my asking?
He hit the wall.

417
00:34:30,695 --> 00:34:33,948
Which turn?
He was probably dead before he hit it.

418
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:37,326
The coroner's report showed
massive heart attack.

419
00:34:52,216 --> 00:34:53,551
I believe we've been pulled over.

420
00:34:58,681 --> 00:35:00,975
All right. Everybody out
and up against the wall here.

421
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:02,643
You're under arrest.

422
00:35:02,727 --> 00:35:04,645
Let's go. Move it.

423
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:09,358
What the hell for?
It's right there in your hand.

424
00:35:09,442 --> 00:35:11,861
Transportation of illegal alcohol
across state lines

425
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:13,654
for the purpose of distribution.

426
00:35:13,738 --> 00:35:15,339
Well, I don't know
what this looks like to you, Officer,

427
00:35:15,364 --> 00:35:18,326
but this is not distribution.
This is consumption.

428
00:35:18,409 --> 00:35:20,769
Well, that don't exactly make it legal.
You know what...

429
00:35:20,828 --> 00:35:22,038
Now up against the wall.

430
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:25,625
What... What is this?
Up against the wall!

431
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:30,963
Officer?

432
00:35:36,636 --> 00:35:39,639
Well, looks like we've found something.

433
00:35:39,722 --> 00:35:41,682
What's that?
A concealed weapon.

434
00:35:41,766 --> 00:35:45,394
Where?
Right here.

435
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:55,154
Now, the only question is,

436
00:36:00,493 --> 00:36:02,578
will he actually use it?

437
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:20,388
Please don't be mad. Harry and
the boys just thought you might like me.

438
00:36:28,354 --> 00:36:31,065
<i>Here we are for summer speed weeks
in Daytona Beach, Florida.</i>

439
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:32,942
<i>It's the Firecracker 400.</i>

440
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:35,778
<i>And the favorite here today
is newcomer Cole Trickle</i>

441
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:38,614
<i>in the number 46 Superflo Chevrolet.</i>

442
00:36:38,698 --> 00:36:41,033
<i>He's the hottest young rookie
in NASCAR history</i>

443
00:36:41,117 --> 00:36:44,954
<i>and has won an unprecedented
five out of his last six races.</i>

444
00:37:01,137 --> 00:37:03,389
Stop playing peek-a-boo
in Rowdy's rearview mirror.

445
00:37:03,472 --> 00:37:05,592
I thought you boys would've
had enough of that by now.

446
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:14,483
I'm not doing anything like that, Harry.
well, then what are you doing?

447
00:37:18,112 --> 00:37:20,047
He rubbed me the wrong way
and loosened his bumper!

448
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:21,792
I'm just gonna
have to come all the way out.

449
00:37:21,866 --> 00:37:24,493
Try that and his rear bumper's liable
to go through the radiator

450
00:37:24,577 --> 00:37:26,137
and take you out
of the whole damn race.

451
00:37:27,997 --> 00:37:30,791
That bumper gets any looser, Rowdy,
they're gonna black-flag you.

452
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:31,876
Let him go by.

453
00:37:34,462 --> 00:37:36,672
He's waving me by,
I'm gonna take him on the high side.

454
00:37:56,776 --> 00:37:58,527
What are you so worried about, Harry?

455
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:03,908
Well, you surely got my attention.
Great driving, great recovery, Cole.

456
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:15,586
<i>Cole Trickle now right behind
the number 51 car of Burns,</i>

457
00:38:15,669 --> 00:38:17,713
<i>and they go at it again.</i>

458
00:38:27,348 --> 00:38:29,225
There's a crash
coming out of turn four, Cole.

459
00:38:35,272 --> 00:38:36,690
I see it!

460
00:39:08,222 --> 00:39:09,265
Can you hear me?

461
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:11,517
I can't see anything.
Wiggle your fingers for me.

462
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,435
Wiggle your toes.

463
00:39:14,103 --> 00:39:15,938
I can't see anything.

464
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,110
I'm all right. Take this off.

465
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:24,321
Hey, what do we got?

466
00:39:24,405 --> 00:39:26,365
Hook up the other monitor.

467
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:30,202
I'm not a car battery.
I don't need recharging.

468
00:39:30,286 --> 00:39:32,121
Relax, it's just standard procedure.

469
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:35,749
Hey, you go screw yourself, okay?
What was that, Mr. Burns?

470
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:38,294
I wouldn't tell you to do that, Doc.

471
00:39:40,796 --> 00:39:42,548
What's going on?
Keep your head down.

472
00:39:42,631 --> 00:39:43,799
Relax.

473
00:39:46,635 --> 00:39:47,720
I can't see.

474
00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:50,222
God, tell me what's going on!
I'm blind, God damn it!

475
00:39:50,306 --> 00:39:52,266
What's your name?
What...

476
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:54,393
What's your name?
Cole. Cole.

477
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:57,771
Cole, would you help us out
and lie still, please?

478
00:39:59,148 --> 00:40:01,775
C-spine and CAT scan, right away.
Yes, Doctor.

479
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:03,179
Can you move your fingers for me?

480
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:12,536
Just tell him he's had a concussion.

481
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:15,497
His brain is bruised,
and like any bruise, it's gonna swell.

482
00:40:15,581 --> 00:40:18,959
Now that swelling is almost certainly
what's affecting his vision.

483
00:40:19,043 --> 00:40:22,087
<i>You have a concussion
and your brain is bruised</i>

484
00:40:22,171 --> 00:40:25,090
<i>and it's going to swell.
It's certainly gonna affect your vision.</i>

485
00:40:25,174 --> 00:40:26,425
You mean this will go away?

486
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:30,262
Tell him we're gonna run some tests
to confirm everything.

487
00:40:30,346 --> 00:40:33,682
What did his helmet look like
and was it cracked?

488
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:35,935
No.

489
00:40:36,936 --> 00:40:39,480
Was it <i>scratched?
Are you a brain doctor?</i>

490
00:40:40,856 --> 00:40:43,943
Was the helmet scratched
at the front or the back?

491
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:46,737
I believe it was scratched
in the back and the front.

492
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,864
<i>Are you a brain doctor?</i>

493
00:40:49,698 --> 00:40:51,825
Could someone talk to me?

494
00:40:55,663 --> 00:41:00,459
When I'm driving, I got a guy on the
radio who talks to me. I can't see him.

495
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:02,378
But he talks to me.

496
00:41:04,213 --> 00:41:07,174
Don't worry,
we're going to take care of him.

497
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:38,872
Harry.

498
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:43,293
Are you okay, Harry?
Yeah. Why?

499
00:41:47,131 --> 00:41:51,010
You look all bent out of shape.

500
00:41:54,763 --> 00:42:00,811
Hell, it's probably just my eyes.
No, it's me, I've been here all night.

501
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:04,148
Jesus. What are they giving me here?

502
00:42:05,941 --> 00:42:07,818
Harry, what happened?

503
00:42:09,528 --> 00:42:12,156
Rowdy was spinning across the track.

504
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:16,952
The rule is you go straight for them.

505
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,622
So I never took my foot off the gas.

506
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:29,548
He should have been gone by the time
I got there, man, but he wasn't.

507
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:34,678
I think another car hit you
and knocked you into Rowdy.

508
00:42:34,762 --> 00:42:38,432
He came out of nowhere.
Yeah.

509
00:42:38,515 --> 00:42:42,102
It's one of those things
that never happens.

510
00:42:42,186 --> 00:42:45,064
I wouldn't even think about it, you know.

511
00:42:46,982 --> 00:42:49,818
I'll get the doctor.
I feel great.

512
00:43:06,627 --> 00:43:07,795
Cole.

513
00:43:11,006 --> 00:43:13,175
Damn nice to see you, Cole.

514
00:43:14,551 --> 00:43:15,552
How you doing, buddy?

515
00:43:15,636 --> 00:43:18,222
It's damn nice to see you, Buck.

516
00:43:18,806 --> 00:43:20,390
How you doing?

517
00:43:22,142 --> 00:43:24,520
Cole, you've met Dr. Lewicki.

518
00:43:29,525 --> 00:43:30,943
That's your doctor, Dr. Lewicki.

519
00:43:31,026 --> 00:43:33,570
I don't think
he's actually seen me before.

520
00:43:33,654 --> 00:43:35,155
Sure, Harry.

521
00:43:36,824 --> 00:43:39,243
No...
Dr. Lewicki.

522
00:43:40,536 --> 00:43:46,041
Smock, stethoscope.
It's a great costume, Harry.

523
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:50,963
So how are you, Doc?
No, Cole, this really is Dr. Lewicki.

524
00:43:51,046 --> 00:43:53,132
I was just about to go off duty.

525
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,884
You thought you'd come by
to look me over.

526
00:43:55,968 --> 00:44:00,013
Well, it's not a bad idea.
I figure your vision's restored?

527
00:44:00,722 --> 00:44:02,141
I think so.

528
00:44:02,224 --> 00:44:04,643
Nothing's blurred?
You're not seeing double?

529
00:44:04,726 --> 00:44:08,230
No haloes around objects?
Flashing lights?

530
00:44:09,606 --> 00:44:14,027
What are you going to do with this?
Look into your eyes.

531
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:17,114
Doc, Doc.

532
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,619
Isn't this what you're really looking for?

533
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:30,752
Well, that's interesting enough,
Mr. Trickle, but it's just not my specialty.

534
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:44,641
She's the real thing?

535
00:44:44,725 --> 00:44:48,562
Well, I wouldn't play no joke on you
in a situation like this.

536
00:44:48,937 --> 00:44:51,607
Sorry, Cole, I'm trying not to smile.

537
00:44:52,107 --> 00:44:53,942
All right, get out.

538
00:44:55,569 --> 00:44:57,029
Get out. Get out of here.

539
00:44:57,112 --> 00:44:58,822
Get some rest, man.

540
00:45:04,203 --> 00:45:05,537
I am not well.

541
00:45:07,748 --> 00:45:09,124
I can walk, God damn it.

542
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:12,377
Not as long
as you're in this hospital you can't.

543
00:45:15,672 --> 00:45:18,400
I don't want to be next to this clown.
You mind picking up the pace a little?

544
00:45:18,425 --> 00:45:22,262
Hey, man, if you want drugs,
you have to see the nurse. Okay?

545
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:44,952
Wait!

546
00:45:59,216 --> 00:46:01,218
Get out of the way.

547
00:46:08,225 --> 00:46:12,854
Good morning, gentlemen.
Right this way.

548
00:46:17,401 --> 00:46:19,945
So, neither Mr. Burns,
nor in this case, Mr. Trickle

549
00:46:20,028 --> 00:46:22,281
present any
significant intracranial injury.

550
00:46:22,364 --> 00:46:25,033
Now hold it, Doc.
Let's have that one in English.

551
00:46:25,117 --> 00:46:27,119
Did they mess up their squash or not?

552
00:46:27,202 --> 00:46:31,415
Their brains are intact. As much as
they were before the accident anyway.

553
00:46:31,498 --> 00:46:33,684
You're willing to give them clearance
to get back on a racetrack?

554
00:46:33,709 --> 00:46:36,336
Well, that's obviously
a dangerous way to spend your time.

555
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:39,923
That's a philosophical objection, Doc,
and I'm looking for a medical one.

556
00:46:40,007 --> 00:46:42,384
I'm not inclined to give them clearance
at this time.

557
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:46,221
That's total horseshit.
Gentlemen, please.

558
00:46:47,764 --> 00:46:50,559
I think they're saying
they would like another opinion.

559
00:46:50,642 --> 00:46:52,644
We would like to talk to your boss.

560
00:46:52,728 --> 00:46:56,315
You're welcome to, of course,
but Dr. Wilhaire and I have consulted

561
00:46:56,398 --> 00:46:58,442
and we're of the same opinion.

562
00:46:58,525 --> 00:47:01,320
Which is a re-evaluation
in a week or two.

563
00:47:01,403 --> 00:47:02,446
Thank you, Doc.

564
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:04,506
Now, we have a little something
we have to say to the boys here

565
00:47:04,531 --> 00:47:06,616
and I don't think you
necessarily need to hear it.

566
00:47:13,707 --> 00:47:15,917
Okay, Big John's turn.

567
00:47:22,424 --> 00:47:24,885
If you wanna turn yourselves
into a greasy spot

568
00:47:24,968 --> 00:47:27,763
on a country road somewhere,
go right ahead.

569
00:47:27,846 --> 00:47:29,781
I don't give a shit
and I don't think anybody else does,

570
00:47:29,806 --> 00:47:31,767
regardless of what they say to your face.

571
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:35,562
But you two monkeys are not going to
do it on my racetrack.

572
00:47:36,855 --> 00:47:39,608
Have you all heard
of Japanese inspection?

573
00:47:40,442 --> 00:47:42,069
Japanese inspection.

574
00:47:42,152 --> 00:47:43,992
You see, when the Japs
get in a load of lettuce

575
00:47:44,071 --> 00:47:46,698
that they're not sure
they want to let in the country,

576
00:47:46,782 --> 00:47:51,453
why, they just let it sit on the docks
until they get good and ready to look at it.

577
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:56,124
By then of course, it's all gone rotten.
Ain't nothing left to inspect.

578
00:47:56,208 --> 00:47:59,878
In other words,
lettuce is a perishable item

579
00:48:01,129 --> 00:48:02,964
like you two monkeys.

580
00:48:03,215 --> 00:48:06,009
You trade paint one more time,
you so much as touch,

581
00:48:06,093 --> 00:48:08,136
I'm gonna black-flag the two of you.

582
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:11,139
Gonna take apart your race-car
for 300 laps.

583
00:48:11,223 --> 00:48:12,557
Then if you pass the inspection,

584
00:48:12,641 --> 00:48:17,104
and you put your car back together,
I might let you get back in the race.

585
00:48:17,396 --> 00:48:20,190
Now, just to show us
there's no hard feelings,

586
00:48:20,273 --> 00:48:22,734
we're all gonna go out
to dinner together.

587
00:48:22,818 --> 00:48:25,362
I've got other plans.
Yeah, and so do I.

588
00:48:25,445 --> 00:48:27,781
Well, you're gonna
have to change them.

589
00:48:27,864 --> 00:48:31,535
And not only that, you two are gonna
drive to dinner together.

590
00:48:39,501 --> 00:48:41,002
Dr. Lewicki.

591
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:44,214
I want to apologize
for what happened with Cole

592
00:48:44,297 --> 00:48:46,967
when you come into the hospital room.

593
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:50,178
Mr. Hogge, please,
it's nothing to worry about.

594
00:48:50,262 --> 00:48:52,848
And in any case
it was hardly your doing.

595
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:54,808
Well, that's just it, I believe it was.

596
00:48:54,891 --> 00:48:58,270
You see, not too long ago
after he won Darlington,

597
00:48:58,353 --> 00:49:00,397
we played a trick on Cole.

598
00:49:00,939 --> 00:49:05,026
We dressed up a pretty girl
in a highway-patrol uniform.

599
00:49:05,152 --> 00:49:10,949
Anyway, we told her to get real ornery
with him and she did.

600
00:49:11,575 --> 00:49:14,578
By ornery, you mean...
I mean, real ornery.

601
00:49:17,164 --> 00:49:19,958
Why would you want me
to know about this?

602
00:49:20,709 --> 00:49:23,170
I don't want you to hold
a bad opinion of Cole.

603
00:49:23,253 --> 00:49:25,297
I believe it scares him.

604
00:49:26,715 --> 00:49:29,593
He needs reassurance
from you that he's okay.

605
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:33,722
After all, you're his doctor.

606
00:49:38,518 --> 00:49:39,853
That's it.

607
00:50:00,081 --> 00:50:01,249
Doc.

608
00:50:02,792 --> 00:50:06,087
I heard you thought
I was a highway-patrol officer.

609
00:50:08,632 --> 00:50:11,176
I also want to thank you
for taking care of me.

610
00:50:11,259 --> 00:50:12,802
It's my job.

611
00:50:13,929 --> 00:50:15,430
It's my life.

612
00:50:16,765 --> 00:50:19,768
Well, this time let's shake hands.

613
00:50:19,851 --> 00:50:22,812
Of course. Of course.
Good luck, Cole.

614
00:50:31,738 --> 00:50:36,660
Dr. Lewicki, could I see you?
You will, I promise.

615
00:50:37,202 --> 00:50:41,915
No, I mean, have some dinner,
go catch a movie. I'll take you to a race.

616
00:50:42,457 --> 00:50:44,668
That's very sweet, really,

617
00:50:44,751 --> 00:50:47,546
but it won't get you back
on the track any faster.

618
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:52,884
No, it's not what I meant.

619
00:51:16,283 --> 00:51:19,828
You got me here, now what?
Here's how I see this deal.

620
00:51:19,911 --> 00:51:23,248
Since you agree I ain't gonna
let you drive this car to dinner

621
00:51:23,331 --> 00:51:25,917
and I agree you ain't gonna
let me drive this car to dinner,

622
00:51:26,001 --> 00:51:27,919
there's only one way to settle this.

623
00:51:28,003 --> 00:51:30,171
What are you talking about?

624
00:51:35,093 --> 00:51:36,636
Absolutely.

625
00:52:17,052 --> 00:52:19,387
Let me tell you something, Tim.

626
00:52:20,555 --> 00:52:23,683
If you can't control your race drivers
any better than this,

627
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,396
you might consider
sticking to something you can control.

628
00:52:31,107 --> 00:52:33,735
Like used cars in downtown Charlotte.

629
00:52:56,299 --> 00:52:59,386
Too close to call?
Yeah.

630
00:53:10,939 --> 00:53:15,610
You're late.
We had car trouble.

631
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:18,613
What kind of car trouble?

632
00:53:19,197 --> 00:53:22,784
I believe it was the radiator.
Wasn't it, Cole?

633
00:53:23,743 --> 00:53:25,954
Yes, Rowdy, I believe it was.

634
00:53:34,129 --> 00:53:37,215
Tim, do you know anybody
at Daytona Memorial?

635
00:53:37,298 --> 00:53:40,051
The chief of staff. Why?
Is he a race fan?

636
00:53:40,135 --> 00:53:41,386
<i>He was born in the South.</i>

637
00:53:41,469 --> 00:53:43,513
Tim wanted you to meet Russ Wheeler.

638
00:53:43,596 --> 00:53:46,725
He's gonna be driving for us
till you get your medical clearance.

639
00:53:46,808 --> 00:53:49,144
It's a real pleasure to race your car,
Mr. Trickle.

640
00:53:49,227 --> 00:53:50,812
Yeah, thanks for helping out.

641
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:55,775
Yeah, Tim, I need a home address
of a doctor...

642
00:53:55,859 --> 00:54:00,071
I'm only sorry I won't be able to drive it
nearly as good as you though.

643
00:54:02,115 --> 00:54:04,159
I'll see you later, Harry.

644
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:07,495
Yeah, the doctor that...

645
00:54:09,664 --> 00:54:10,874
That...

646
00:54:13,835 --> 00:54:15,003
What?

647
00:54:32,645 --> 00:54:35,273
I was desperate to get your attention.

648
00:54:37,108 --> 00:54:39,944
Well, you got it. I walked into a jungle.

649
00:54:41,362 --> 00:54:47,202
No, it's nicely extravagant, but really,
I can't. I'm a doctor on call.

650
00:54:47,786 --> 00:54:51,414
And I'm a patient. Somebody has to
re-examine me. I need clearance.

651
00:54:51,706 --> 00:54:53,349
Come up here and do that.
I'll take you to a race.

652
00:54:53,374 --> 00:54:56,461
Come on, I don't want to watch you guys
going round and round in circles,

653
00:54:56,544 --> 00:54:59,506
chasing each other like a pack of dogs
on my day off.

654
00:54:59,589 --> 00:55:02,300
Then how about chasing me
on your day off?

655
00:55:02,383 --> 00:55:05,804
<i>I don't have a day off.
I'm on call 24 hours.</i>

656
00:55:05,887 --> 00:55:09,682
Okay, Doctor, let's suppose
you had a couple of days off...

657
00:55:09,766 --> 00:55:11,643
Sugar. Sugar.

658
00:55:11,726 --> 00:55:13,686
With nothing else to do.

659
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:17,649
Could I interest you
in the North Carolina countryside?

660
00:55:17,899 --> 00:55:21,319
Speaking theoretically?
Speaking theoretically.

661
00:55:21,402 --> 00:55:24,656
<i>Maybe.
But you'd have to convince my boss.</i>

662
00:55:24,739 --> 00:55:28,660
Good. Good. How tall are you?

663
00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:46,344
What did he say?

664
00:55:46,427 --> 00:55:49,764
"Doctor, fly to Charlotte
and check those boys out."

665
00:55:53,434 --> 00:55:56,354
BOY, you're very quick.

666
00:55:57,939 --> 00:56:00,024
You ought to see me drive.

667
00:56:04,445 --> 00:56:05,530
Rowdy's not here.

668
00:56:05,613 --> 00:56:09,033
Well, I told him to meet us at the infield
by 5:00.

669
00:56:09,117 --> 00:56:12,537
Well, we should probably get started
on Cole.

670
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:19,794
Close your eyes. Palms up.

671
00:56:22,088 --> 00:56:25,300
Open your eyes. Arms down.

672
00:56:26,676 --> 00:56:28,344
Follow my finger.

673
00:56:44,152 --> 00:56:47,322
Stand with your feet together
and close your eyes.

674
00:56:50,825 --> 00:56:55,163
Walk one foot in front of the other.
Open your eyes.

675
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:58,666
And back on the table.

676
00:57:06,466 --> 00:57:08,009
This is tough.

677
00:57:08,509 --> 00:57:11,137
Examinations always are.
Why's that?

678
00:57:11,721 --> 00:57:15,600
Because I'm looking you over
and I might not like what I see.

679
00:57:15,683 --> 00:57:19,646
That has to worry you.
Pick a spot on the wall and look at it.

680
00:57:25,026 --> 00:57:27,445
Please, don't move. Your eyes.
I didn't move.

681
00:57:27,528 --> 00:57:29,447
Just focus on one spot.

682
00:57:39,707 --> 00:57:43,127
What do you see?
The retina.

683
00:57:44,671 --> 00:57:46,547
What does it look like?

684
00:57:49,968 --> 00:57:51,886
Very pretty, actually.

685
00:57:59,477 --> 00:58:01,562
Seen enough?
Just about.

686
00:58:05,066 --> 00:58:08,903
What did you do that for?
It's the Babinski sign.

687
00:58:10,279 --> 00:58:12,657
If the toe goes up, you're in trouble.

688
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:16,369
You're fine. Put on your clothes.
You're cleared to race.

689
00:58:34,429 --> 00:58:37,265
I'm sorry, it just drove me nuts in there.

690
00:58:39,892 --> 00:58:43,604
How could you ignore me like that?
I wasn't ignoring you!

691
00:58:50,903 --> 00:58:54,657
I wasn't ignoring you.
I gave you a very thorough physical.

692
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:05,626
You're not gonna do anything weird
on my leg, are you, Cole?

693
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:06,794
No.

694
00:59:07,587 --> 00:59:10,757
It's just something Harry and I
work on together.

695
00:59:11,132 --> 00:59:13,051
It's called drafting.

696
00:59:14,469 --> 00:59:19,515
One car tucks in behind another.
Two cars can go faster than one.

697
00:59:20,141 --> 00:59:22,393
They divide the air resistance
between them.

698
00:59:22,477 --> 00:59:24,687
Now, here's where it gets interesting.

699
00:59:24,771 --> 00:59:28,483
The lead car has to floor it
to hit 200 miles an hour.

700
00:59:28,566 --> 00:59:31,110
But the car that's stuck behind doesn't.

701
00:59:31,194 --> 00:59:34,697
He can go just as fast
and still have power in reserve.

702
00:59:34,781 --> 00:59:38,951
So, when these two cars
come off that last turn,

703
00:59:39,243 --> 00:59:42,455
the car that's in back
can move out of the draft,

704
00:59:42,538 --> 00:59:46,334
and slingshot past the lead car,
beat it to the finish line.

705
00:59:49,962 --> 00:59:52,590
And he goes straight to Victory Lane.

706
00:59:54,342 --> 00:59:59,263
You and Harry work on that, huh?
More or less.

707
01:00:00,598 --> 01:00:05,520
Yeah, right. Is there anything
you want to do besides racing?

708
01:00:10,858 --> 01:00:12,527
Anything you say.

709
01:00:13,444 --> 01:00:19,117
Cole, there must be something else
that you want to do in life, eventually.

710
01:00:23,704 --> 01:00:27,792
I can tell you what I don't want to be
in life, that's a fraud.

711
01:00:29,377 --> 01:00:33,881
I want to know it's not just dumb luck
that gets me around that racetrack.

712
01:00:35,883 --> 01:00:38,886
But that's not the question
you're really asking.

713
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:41,264
What's the question I'm really asking?

714
01:00:41,347 --> 01:00:45,268
"How can I be in bed with this guy?"
I know the answer to that one.

715
01:00:45,351 --> 01:00:48,146
Maybe, but you're still asking it.

716
01:00:48,229 --> 01:00:51,149
"How could I, a brilliant brain doctor,

717
01:00:51,232 --> 01:00:54,610
"be in bed with a guy
who drives a car for a living?"

718
01:00:57,405 --> 01:01:00,199
What's your response to that,
by the way?

719
01:01:02,702 --> 01:01:07,039
Do something to make me respect you.
Do it.

720
01:01:07,123 --> 01:01:10,001
Tell me what you love
so much about racing.

721
01:01:11,669 --> 01:01:13,045
The speed.

722
01:01:15,131 --> 01:01:17,216
To be able to control it.

723
01:01:17,884 --> 01:01:21,596
To know that I can control something
that's out of control.

724
01:01:24,974 --> 01:01:27,143
I'd really have to show you.

725
01:01:29,604 --> 01:01:30,897
Show me.

726
01:01:53,711 --> 01:01:57,465
It's funny about this place.
When I grew up, I hated farming.

727
01:01:57,548 --> 01:02:02,053
All I wanted to do was work on
race-cars. Got to racing.

728
01:02:02,136 --> 01:02:05,473
Now all I want to do is to make
enough money to work on a farm.

729
01:02:05,556 --> 01:02:07,350
Hi, Claire, I'm Jennie. Nice to meet you.

730
01:02:07,433 --> 01:02:08,684
Hi, nice to meet you.

731
01:02:08,768 --> 01:02:10,353
Hi, Cole.
Hey, Jennie.

732
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:20,112
Just beyond the top of that knoll, we're
going to build our permanent home.

733
01:02:20,196 --> 01:02:23,032
Costs much to build up there?
About $10 million.

734
01:02:23,115 --> 01:02:24,116
Oh, Rowdy.

735
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:28,162
Jennie's gonna do the building.
She's designing the house.

736
01:02:28,246 --> 01:02:31,082
We just want a place
that nobody's ever lived in but us.

737
01:02:31,165 --> 01:02:33,167
Isn't that right, honey?

738
01:02:35,169 --> 01:02:38,256
Rowdy, what is it?
I think I'm getting seasick.

739
01:02:38,339 --> 01:02:40,459
Seasick? You've never been seasick
a day in your life.

740
01:02:45,221 --> 01:02:48,307
You didn't forget about the physical,
did you?

741
01:02:49,016 --> 01:02:52,687
Nobody in my family goes to a doctor
unless they're dying.

742
01:02:53,729 --> 01:02:56,232
Just 'cause you ain't feeling good, shit.

743
01:02:56,315 --> 01:02:58,567
Stand with your feet together.

744
01:03:01,696 --> 01:03:03,364
Put your arms out.

745
01:03:05,116 --> 01:03:06,742
Close your eyes.

746
01:03:13,249 --> 01:03:16,627
Take it easy. Take it easy.

747
01:03:16,711 --> 01:03:19,213
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Yeah, I've got you.

748
01:03:19,297 --> 01:03:21,924
I'm fine. I'm fine.
All right.

749
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:32,476
We've got to get you back to Daytona.

750
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:35,771
Bill Wilhaire, the head of neurosurgery,
is my boss.

751
01:03:35,896 --> 01:03:37,940
He's as good as they come.

752
01:03:41,402 --> 01:03:45,573
Did you get sick in there?
No.

753
01:03:46,032 --> 01:03:47,908
He did, he got sick.
Rowdy.

754
01:03:47,992 --> 01:03:53,080
You're one hell of a candy-ass.
I faint and you throw up.

755
01:03:53,164 --> 01:03:55,666
Rowdy, it's imperative that you get back
to Daytona Memorial

756
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:57,585
and see Dr. Wilhaire.

757
01:04:13,267 --> 01:04:15,811
<i>The report on the birth
of another new Winston Cup team.</i>

758
01:04:15,895 --> 01:04:18,230
<i>Behind me, the bright orange
and blue colors of Hardee's</i>

759
01:04:18,314 --> 01:04:21,359
<i>adorn this Chevrolet. Who's the driver?
Well, to no one's surprise,</i>

760
01:04:21,442 --> 01:04:23,652
<i>it's Russ Wheeler,
the young man who subbed so superbly</i>

761
01:04:23,736 --> 01:04:25,654
<i>just weeks ago
for the injured Cole Trickle.</i>

762
01:04:25,738 --> 01:04:26,864
Listen to this horseshit.

763
01:04:26,947 --> 01:04:30,868
<i>Now joined by car owner, Tim Daland.
Now, Tim, my question now is,</i>

764
01:04:30,951 --> 01:04:32,912
<i>you've got two competitive spirits here,</i>

765
01:04:32,995 --> 01:04:35,456
<i>and will these competitive spirits
cause you a conflict?</i>

766
01:04:35,539 --> 01:04:38,042
<i>Well, of course, Jerry,
we believe that we can</i>

767
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:41,295
<i>maintain the integrity and the
independence of these two race teams,</i>

768
01:04:41,379 --> 01:04:42,880
<i>otherwise, we wouldn't be doing it.</i>

769
01:04:42,963 --> 01:04:45,925
Who will you be rooting for
come Sunday, Tim?

770
01:04:46,217 --> 01:04:50,054
<i>Well, I tell you, Jerry, I'll even
wave to him every time I lap him.</i>

771
01:04:56,227 --> 01:04:59,021
These new tires are terrible.
You should have put on scuffs.

772
01:04:59,105 --> 01:05:00,147
You're doing good, Cole.

773
01:05:00,981 --> 01:05:02,483
I'm too loose.

774
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,824
The car just feels all wrong.

775
01:05:11,534 --> 01:05:13,661
What's wrong?
Cole's upset.

776
01:05:13,744 --> 01:05:16,580
What about?
About being in that race-car.

777
01:05:21,293 --> 01:05:27,049
Wheeler just passed the eighth car.
He's coming up on your inside.

778
01:05:36,183 --> 01:05:37,184
Jesus!

779
01:06:09,884 --> 01:06:11,969
What happened?
The engine blew.

780
01:06:12,052 --> 01:06:14,555
How?
I'm not a mechanic, Harry.

781
01:06:30,571 --> 01:06:33,699
Claire, I'm in Georgia today.
Rowdy's in North Carolina.

782
01:06:33,782 --> 01:06:36,035
Well, somebody better talk him
into coming down here.

783
01:06:36,118 --> 01:06:38,871
Claire, we've got a trauma in the ER.

784
01:06:38,954 --> 01:06:40,890
He's almost certainly hemorrhaging.
The longer he ignores it,

785
01:06:40,915 --> 01:06:43,209
the more damage is gonna be done
to his brain.

786
01:06:43,292 --> 01:06:45,211
<i>He's your friend, Cole.</i>

787
01:06:45,461 --> 01:06:48,339
Where's Cole?
He's on the phone.

788
01:06:50,591 --> 01:06:52,843
He could use a little privacy.

789
01:06:58,432 --> 01:06:59,475
What's wrong with him?

790
01:06:59,558 --> 01:07:01,810
I'll tell you what's wrong in this deal,
it's you, Tim.

791
01:07:01,894 --> 01:07:04,230
You're a victim
of your own goddamn creation.

792
01:07:04,313 --> 01:07:07,858
Two race teams! That's one too many
roosters in the hen house.

793
01:07:07,942 --> 01:07:09,460
It doesn't seem to bother
Russ Wheeler.

794
01:07:09,485 --> 01:07:11,737
Oh, no, no, no.
Ever since that Daytona crash,

795
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:13,447
Cole's been called a troublemaker.

796
01:07:13,531 --> 01:07:16,700
Wheeler figures he can bump
and bam Cole all he wants.

797
01:07:16,784 --> 01:07:18,702
I don't see Russ
doing anything like that,

798
01:07:18,786 --> 01:07:20,706
NASCAR doesn't see Russ
doing anything like that.

799
01:07:20,788 --> 01:07:22,540
I guess it ain't happening then,

800
01:07:22,623 --> 01:07:26,043
under the watchful eyes of experts
like you and NASCAR.

801
01:07:26,126 --> 01:07:28,295
I tell you what is happening.

802
01:07:28,879 --> 01:07:32,091
Cole's not running good,
he's not looking good,

803
01:07:32,174 --> 01:07:33,759
and now he's got sponsor trouble.

804
01:07:33,842 --> 01:07:36,470
But you don't, is that it?
As far as that goes, no, I don't.

805
01:07:36,554 --> 01:07:39,014
But I want to keep the sponsor
and Cole.

806
01:07:39,098 --> 01:07:40,658
He's the one that really
made this happen for us

807
01:07:40,683 --> 01:07:42,142
and I haven't forgotten that, Harry.

808
01:07:42,226 --> 01:07:43,978
Right. Right.

809
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:52,778
You on the phone with the doc?
Fighting?

810
01:07:54,113 --> 01:07:56,657
She's too busy to talk right now.

811
01:07:57,741 --> 01:07:59,076
Here's your owner, Tim Daland.

812
01:07:59,159 --> 01:08:00,953
What do you think
about this young man, Tim?

813
01:08:01,036 --> 01:08:05,291
I think Russ ran a great race today.
I'm really, really very pleased.

814
01:08:06,083 --> 01:08:07,751
<i>One hundred and two laps complete,</i>

815
01:08:07,835 --> 01:08:09,755
<i>but we're under caution here
at North Wilkesboro.</i>

816
01:08:10,671 --> 01:08:12,798
How come Cole hasn't seen Rowdy yet?

817
01:08:12,881 --> 01:08:15,301
Cole's no different from any other driver.

818
01:08:15,384 --> 01:08:17,094
What do you mean he's no different?

819
01:08:17,177 --> 01:08:21,098
Well, I mean, of course
Cole doesn't want to see Rowdy.

820
01:08:21,181 --> 01:08:24,310
Drivers can't stand to be reminded of
what can happen to them in a race-car.

821
01:08:24,393 --> 01:08:27,104
They don't go to hospitals,
they don't go to funerals.

822
01:08:27,187 --> 01:08:30,441
You get a driver to a funeral
before he's actually dead,

823
01:08:30,524 --> 01:08:32,401
you made history, Doc.

824
01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:58,719
He's blocking me.
That's right.

825
01:09:01,388 --> 01:09:03,390
Move the son of a bitch!

826
01:09:57,695 --> 01:09:59,488
Son of a bitch!

827
01:09:59,571 --> 01:10:04,118
<i>Trickle moving to the bottom of the
track with both right-side tires flat.</i>

828
01:10:05,369 --> 01:10:08,997
<i>Russ Wheeler
takes the checkered flag...</i>

829
01:10:14,837 --> 01:10:16,880
Russ Wheeler don't deserve to win,
Tim.

830
01:10:16,964 --> 01:10:20,384
If NASCAR won't call it lowdown,
shit-assed racing, you better.

831
01:10:20,467 --> 01:10:21,860
It's just racing, Harry.
Oh, yeah?

832
01:10:21,885 --> 01:10:23,721
Cole overreacted. Yeah.
Oh, yeah?

833
01:10:31,395 --> 01:10:32,604
Change my tires.

834
01:10:32,688 --> 01:10:36,608
I don't know what for, Cole. It's over.
Change my tires.

835
01:11:09,349 --> 01:11:13,729
<i>There seems to be a little post-race
activity just outside the pit lane.</i>

836
01:11:13,812 --> 01:11:15,105
You shit!

837
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:23,030
He's destroyed both my cars.
He's destroyed both my cars!

838
01:11:23,781 --> 01:11:26,450
He's fired! You're fired!

839
01:11:26,533 --> 01:11:28,535
You're all fired. You hear me?

840
01:11:42,758 --> 01:11:46,094
Are you going to get your bags,
head off to Daytona?

841
01:11:46,178 --> 01:11:48,764
Where are you going from here?

842
01:11:48,847 --> 01:11:52,434
I'll take you to the airport,
drop off the rental car,

843
01:11:52,518 --> 01:11:54,561
catch a flight to Charlotte.

844
01:11:57,105 --> 01:11:59,399
You want me to come with you?

845
01:12:01,527 --> 01:12:04,404
You don't have to go back
to the hospital?

846
01:12:04,488 --> 01:12:08,659
We could also try to see Rowdy.
Yeah.

847
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:15,332
Is there anything wrong with that?
Of course not.

848
01:12:16,917 --> 01:12:20,337
I guess I just forgot about that.
Yeah, I know.

849
01:12:25,759 --> 01:12:26,885
Cole!

850
01:12:34,893 --> 01:12:36,013
Let me out of the car, Cole.

851
01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:41,942
Let me out of the car, Cole.
Let me out of the car.

852
01:12:46,989 --> 01:12:50,284
Let me out of the car!
Let me out or I'm getting out.

853
01:12:51,243 --> 01:12:52,703
Hey! Hey, hey!

854
01:12:54,329 --> 01:12:57,875
Claire! Wait. Just wait.

855
01:12:57,958 --> 01:12:59,726
Get away or I'll call the police.
You'll what?

856
01:12:59,751 --> 01:13:01,962
You heard me.
Okay, call the police.

857
01:13:02,045 --> 01:13:03,188
But I'm not leaving until you talk.

858
01:13:03,213 --> 01:13:04,840
I've got nothing to say.
Well, I do!

859
01:13:04,923 --> 01:13:07,134
Okay, great. Let's hear it.

860
01:13:10,679 --> 01:13:12,764
That's it? Fine.
Just...

861
01:13:12,848 --> 01:13:15,893
You shouldn't be driving a car anyway.
Not on a road, not on a racetrack,

862
01:13:15,976 --> 01:13:17,185
and not in a parking lot.

863
01:13:17,269 --> 01:13:20,647
You're selfish, you're crazy
and you're scared.

864
01:13:20,731 --> 01:13:22,941
I'm not scared.
You are scared to death.

865
01:13:23,025 --> 01:13:25,485
You and Rowdy, you have
the same sickness. It's called denial.

866
01:13:25,569 --> 01:13:28,405
And it's probably going to kill you both.

867
01:13:33,243 --> 01:13:34,887
You want to control something
that's out of control,

868
01:13:34,912 --> 01:13:37,247
that's what you said to me, wasn't it?

869
01:13:37,331 --> 01:13:38,640
I'm going to let you in on a little secret

870
01:13:38,665 --> 01:13:41,585
that almost everybody else in this world
automatically knows.

871
01:13:41,668 --> 01:13:44,379
Control is an illusion,
you infantile egomaniac.

872
01:13:44,463 --> 01:13:46,924
Nobody knows
what's gonna happen next.

873
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:50,010
Not on a freeway, not in an airplane,
not inside our own bodies,

874
01:13:50,093 --> 01:13:54,097
and certainly not on a racetrack
with 40 other infantile egomaniacs.

875
01:13:54,181 --> 01:13:56,266
Nobody knows
and nobody controls anything.

876
01:13:56,350 --> 01:13:58,894
Now, you've gotten a glimpse of that
and you're scared.

877
01:13:58,977 --> 01:14:00,495
You might not have the courage
to race anymore.

878
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,606
You may never have had it.

879
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:08,378
God, I hate you for this,
you son of a bitch.

880
01:14:08,403 --> 01:14:10,781
You make me sound like a doctor.

881
01:15:05,585 --> 01:15:06,920
Jennie.

882
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,549
Why are you here?

883
01:15:13,093 --> 01:15:14,511
Where is he?

884
01:15:27,107 --> 01:15:29,568
I hear you're out of a job.
Yeah.

885
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:37,367
You're not looking too good.

886
01:15:39,453 --> 01:15:41,997
How many of these things
do you chew every day?

887
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:44,207
What did you come here for?

888
01:15:47,169 --> 01:15:49,337
To take you to the hospital.

889
01:15:52,716 --> 01:15:54,634
If it had been anybody
but a damn woman doctor,

890
01:15:54,718 --> 01:15:57,679
I'd have been back on the track
weeks ago.

891
01:15:57,804 --> 01:16:00,557
Is that right?
Yeah, that's right.

892
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:04,394
Listen, man, I've raced
with my legs broke, heart bruised,

893
01:16:04,478 --> 01:16:07,731
eyes popping out of my head
like they're on springs.

894
01:16:08,398 --> 01:16:11,568
This is going to go away
just like anything else.

895
01:16:11,693 --> 01:16:13,695
As far as I'm concerned,
I'm going to live forever,

896
01:16:13,779 --> 01:16:16,198
unless I go to some damn hospital
where they

897
01:16:16,281 --> 01:16:20,827
take your shoes off, and make you shut
your eyes, and bang, you're dead.

898
01:16:21,953 --> 01:16:23,997
What did you win this for?

899
01:16:24,831 --> 01:16:27,959
This one right here.
What did you win this for?

900
01:16:29,503 --> 01:16:31,296
Doesn't it say?

901
01:16:31,421 --> 01:16:35,717
Yeah, it's the Winston Cup, buddy.
Well, hell, that's an easy one to forget.

902
01:16:35,842 --> 01:16:39,262
What's your name?
Or has that slipped your mind, too?

903
01:16:42,724 --> 01:16:45,185
Screw you, man.
Okay.

904
01:16:46,103 --> 01:16:49,106
We can go down there and fix your head
or we can fix it right here!

905
01:16:49,189 --> 01:16:51,191
Now, what's it gonna be?

906
01:16:57,072 --> 01:16:59,241
Rowdy would like to see you.

907
01:17:05,705 --> 01:17:07,791
How is he?
He's okay.

908
01:17:09,042 --> 01:17:11,128
How are you?
Good.

909
01:17:12,879 --> 01:17:15,298
Think he'll make Daytona?
It's not for a few months.

910
01:17:15,382 --> 01:17:20,387
I think he'll make it out of the hospital.
But he'll never drive a race-car again.

911
01:17:27,602 --> 01:17:31,231
Cole, this is Dr. Wilhaire.
He's going to be doing the surgery.

912
01:17:31,398 --> 01:17:33,233
Cole Trickle.
Cole.

913
01:17:34,192 --> 01:17:35,735
So, how is he?

914
01:17:36,736 --> 01:17:40,198
Well, the doc here says
I need minor brain surgery.

915
01:17:40,282 --> 01:17:41,950
Well, that's not exactly how I put it.

916
01:17:42,033 --> 01:17:46,079
Well, listen, Doc, any surgery
on his brain is bound to be minor.

917
01:17:47,914 --> 01:17:50,167
You all mind if I talk to this guy
a second?

918
01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:51,626
Of course.

919
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:06,349
They say I got a busted blood vessel
in my brain.

920
01:18:06,433 --> 01:18:10,937
So, they want to drill a hole in my head
and get rid of the leaky blood.

921
01:18:12,439 --> 01:18:15,275
You think I should let them do it, Cole?

922
01:18:16,276 --> 01:18:17,569
Yeah.

923
01:18:17,652 --> 01:18:21,323
You'd let them if it was you?
I would.

924
01:18:22,032 --> 01:18:25,535
Okay, then I've got to ask you to do
something for me.

925
01:18:26,578 --> 01:18:28,079
Well, name it.

926
01:18:28,163 --> 01:18:32,042
Drive my car.
What are you talking about?

927
01:18:32,125 --> 01:18:33,418
Daytona.

928
01:18:36,421 --> 01:18:38,607
No, Rowdy, you have plenty of time
to get ready for Daytona.

929
01:18:38,632 --> 01:18:40,300
You don't need me.

930
01:18:42,385 --> 01:18:46,181
I lost my sponsor. They put their money
on me, not the car.

931
01:18:46,264 --> 01:18:49,935
Now, they ain't too sure
I'm going to come out of this deal.

932
01:18:50,435 --> 01:18:51,686
Are you?

933
01:18:55,232 --> 01:18:59,110
I've got a lot of land
and a lot of plans I ain't paid for.

934
01:18:59,194 --> 01:19:02,781
So the only way to get my sponsor back
is to make sure

935
01:19:02,864 --> 01:19:04,407
my car runs good at Daytona.

936
01:19:04,491 --> 01:19:06,993
All that network TV shit, you know.

937
01:19:08,328 --> 01:19:11,264
Well, you don't need me. There's plenty
of other drivers. You don't need me.

938
01:19:11,289 --> 01:19:14,793
Don't give me that mealy-mouthed shit,
you son of a bitch.

939
01:19:14,876 --> 01:19:17,545
I got to put a driver in my car
that'll finish in the top five,

940
01:19:17,629 --> 01:19:21,007
before my sponsors
will pick up the tab for the year.

941
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:25,720
Maybe after Daytona, maybe I can drive.

942
01:19:27,222 --> 01:19:28,490
Maybe it'll be a different driver.

943
01:19:28,515 --> 01:19:31,643
But in the meantime,
I want the best for my family.

944
01:19:31,726 --> 01:19:34,396
So don't you bullshit me, Cole.

945
01:19:34,479 --> 01:19:38,900
Is there some other reason why I ain't
good enough for you to drive for?

946
01:19:49,494 --> 01:19:51,204
Then you'll do it?

947
01:20:05,343 --> 01:20:08,430
Shit, man. You had me going.

948
01:20:10,223 --> 01:20:14,394
Now, let's get down to business here.
What's your deal with Daland?

949
01:20:17,564 --> 01:20:21,067
Hell, we'll work that out, okay?
Excuse me for a second.

950
01:20:26,364 --> 01:20:29,701
Cole, what's wrong?
Just tell Rowdy I'll call him.

951
01:20:47,427 --> 01:20:49,888
No, no, no, no, sir!

952
01:20:49,971 --> 01:20:53,183
Can't use them. Don't want them.
Couldn't afford them if I did.

953
01:20:53,266 --> 01:20:54,976
What the hell are you talking about?

954
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:58,688
Race-car drivers.
I know all about you and Rowdy Burns.

955
01:20:58,772 --> 01:21:02,901
And I ain't setting up that car
for Daytona or anywhere else, Cole,

956
01:21:02,984 --> 01:21:04,778
but you're welcome to come on in.

957
01:21:04,861 --> 01:21:08,365
We'll bring out the moonshine and start
telling lies and calling up the women.

958
01:21:08,448 --> 01:21:12,535
But no talk about racing. Come on.
All right, no talk about racing.

959
01:21:12,619 --> 01:21:14,120
Come on, Buck,

960
01:21:14,788 --> 01:21:16,581
I'll race your ass.

961
01:21:29,677 --> 01:21:32,806
I believe I'm gonna take off.
Good night, Harry.

962
01:21:46,486 --> 01:21:48,738
Why won't you set up the car?

963
01:21:53,827 --> 01:21:56,913
Ever since you and Rowdy crashed
at Daytona and Rowdy got sick,

964
01:21:56,996 --> 01:21:58,836
you've been waiting
for the other shoe to drop,

965
01:21:58,873 --> 01:22:01,709
waiting on something bad
to happen to you.

966
01:22:03,378 --> 01:22:05,397
Just like Buddy Bretherton.
He started hearing voices.

967
01:22:05,422 --> 01:22:09,092
All kinds of them, everywhere.
Atlanta, Richmond, Wilkesboro.

968
01:22:09,175 --> 01:22:12,053
And all of them
only had but one thing to say,

969
01:22:12,137 --> 01:22:16,266
"Get out of that race-car. Get out..."

970
01:22:22,147 --> 01:22:23,523
You pegged the engine in Atlanta,

971
01:22:23,606 --> 01:22:26,109
red-lined the son of a bitch
and blew it sky-high.

972
01:22:26,192 --> 01:22:29,028
Done it deliberate. Done it deliberate.

973
01:22:30,488 --> 01:22:35,160
9,400 rpms
according to the little telltale button.

974
01:22:37,704 --> 01:22:41,583
You was worried if you didn't get out
of that car right quick, you'd die.

975
01:22:41,666 --> 01:22:43,418
Now call me a liar.

976
01:22:45,003 --> 01:22:46,713
You're not lying.

977
01:22:46,796 --> 01:22:50,550
All right. What the hell
are we talking about then?

978
01:22:50,633 --> 01:22:54,471
Racing Rowdy's car at Daytona.
I can't do it without you.

979
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:57,098
You can't do it period.

980
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:01,895
And I ain't going back there, Cole.

981
01:23:13,239 --> 01:23:16,534
Buddy didn't really die of a heart attack,
did he?

982
01:23:17,327 --> 01:23:20,872
Buddy didn't really die of a heart attack,
did he?

983
01:23:20,955 --> 01:23:24,250
No, he didn't,
but you don't wanna hear about it.

984
01:23:27,629 --> 01:23:31,841
NASCAR privately claimed the setup
on the car is what killed Buddy.

985
01:23:35,595 --> 01:23:37,972
You used thin-walled tubing
to keep the weight down.

986
01:23:38,056 --> 01:23:40,225
The exhaust fumes
broke through the fire wall

987
01:23:40,308 --> 01:23:42,685
and carbon monoxide
knocked Buddy out.

988
01:23:42,810 --> 01:23:45,438
Horseshit! When Buddy hit the wall
at the third turn,

989
01:23:45,522 --> 01:23:48,525
he was jabbering on the radio
about as fast as he was driving.

990
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:51,027
Carbon monoxide, my ass.

991
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:52,904
That was the loudest-talking
unconscious man

992
01:23:52,987 --> 01:23:54,155
you ever heard in your life.

993
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:57,367
Nothing killed Buddy
but his imagination.

994
01:23:57,450 --> 01:24:00,912
Why didn't you let them investigate,
Harry? Why? Why?

995
01:24:02,539 --> 01:24:06,459
'Cause I should have known better
than to let him drive in the first place.

996
01:24:08,169 --> 01:24:10,129
You see, Buddy...

997
01:24:10,255 --> 01:24:13,216
Buddy was a terrible pain in the ass.
He really was.

998
01:24:13,299 --> 01:24:14,968
He thought he knew about cars,

999
01:24:15,051 --> 01:24:17,345
which made him twice as ignorant
as you.

1000
01:24:19,264 --> 01:24:20,682
But still...

1001
01:24:27,230 --> 01:24:30,108
I look at guys like Buddy...

1002
01:24:30,191 --> 01:24:34,904
I've seen him do things in my race-car
that's absolutely unbelievable.

1003
01:24:34,988 --> 01:24:37,657
That really showed me what I had done.

1004
01:24:38,658 --> 01:24:39,701
And then you see,

1005
01:24:39,784 --> 01:24:42,829
you're gonna automatically have to
sort of love that guy.

1006
01:24:42,912 --> 01:24:45,039
Whether you want to or not.

1007
01:24:47,083 --> 01:24:48,751
Buddy Bretherton.

1008
01:24:51,254 --> 01:24:53,840
I have to ask you something, Harry.

1009
01:24:54,507 --> 01:24:59,679
Now, before Buddy hit the wall,

1010
01:24:59,762 --> 01:25:02,515
how was he actually doing in that race?

1011
01:25:03,516 --> 01:25:07,437
You ornery, no good...
Hey, hey...

1012
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:11,774
You set up that car. You set up the car.

1013
01:25:11,858 --> 01:25:15,903
If you get back in that car, you'll die.
You'll die. You hear?

1014
01:25:20,241 --> 01:25:23,911
I'm not getting back in my car,
I'm getting in Rowdy's.

1015
01:25:23,995 --> 01:25:27,206
Well, I see how you're dumb enough
to be a race driver.

1016
01:25:27,290 --> 01:25:29,626
You think you'll hide from your bad luck
in his car?

1017
01:25:29,709 --> 01:25:31,753
What the hell for? For Rowdy?

1018
01:25:31,836 --> 01:25:35,089
If he could run tomorrow,
he'd crash you to win the race!

1019
01:25:35,173 --> 01:25:36,174
He's mean.

1020
01:25:36,257 --> 01:25:40,219
He's no particular friend, so why?
Because he asked me to.

1021
01:25:40,303 --> 01:25:43,306
Horseshit! You just wanna race again.

1022
01:25:43,389 --> 01:25:46,392
Yeah. And so do you.

1023
01:25:46,476 --> 01:25:48,478
Well, you're scared.

1024
01:25:48,561 --> 01:25:51,981
You're scared.
Yeah, and so are you.

1025
01:25:54,108 --> 01:25:55,234
Yeah.

1026
01:26:05,161 --> 01:26:06,287
What?

1027
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:11,292
I need this, Harry.

1028
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:17,548
I don't have anything else.

1029
01:26:20,093 --> 01:26:22,053
You've given me a life.

1030
01:26:26,349 --> 01:26:28,976
God damn it, I don't want to lose it.

1031
01:26:30,311 --> 01:26:32,063
Just put me in that race-car.

1032
01:26:32,146 --> 01:26:35,233
Let me be the one to show you
what you've done.

1033
01:26:36,943 --> 01:26:38,444
Just trust me.

1034
01:26:43,991 --> 01:26:48,538
Let me drive, Harry.
I won't make a fool out of you.

1035
01:26:59,716 --> 01:27:06,389
I honestly just wouldn't know
how this deal's going to turn out, Cole.

1036
01:27:06,472 --> 01:27:07,807
You know.

1037
01:27:09,684 --> 01:27:11,477
Neither do I, Harry.

1038
01:27:36,335 --> 01:27:37,712
I'm setting up for cool weather.

1039
01:27:37,795 --> 01:27:40,047
But if that sun breaks
after you're on the track,

1040
01:27:40,131 --> 01:27:42,592
you're liable to run real loose real quick.

1041
01:27:42,675 --> 01:27:45,428
I don't wanna worry you enough,
but Cole's not ready for that.

1042
01:27:45,511 --> 01:27:48,306
He's changed. See, he's changed.

1043
01:27:48,389 --> 01:27:52,435
You cannot get out of control
and expect him to bring you right back.

1044
01:27:52,518 --> 01:27:55,855
He's liable to hurt you,
you're liable to hurt him.

1045
01:27:56,689 --> 01:27:58,941
I couldn't handle that. So...

1046
01:28:00,234 --> 01:28:03,070
You've got to take care of him. All right?

1047
01:28:04,363 --> 01:28:06,699
You've got to take care of him.

1048
01:28:17,794 --> 01:28:21,380
This is not the kind of answer
I'm looking for from you.

1049
01:28:27,887 --> 01:28:30,014
Daytona is a tough racetrack.

1050
01:28:30,097 --> 01:28:32,308
And I'm sure, myself and everybody,

1051
01:28:32,391 --> 01:28:34,644
we're going to keep an eye on Cole
to see

1052
01:28:34,727 --> 01:28:36,967
if he's there, you know,
all his reflexes and everything.

1053
01:28:37,230 --> 01:28:38,790
He's plenty capable
of running that race-car good

1054
01:28:38,815 --> 01:28:40,255
and I don't think he has any kind of

1055
01:28:40,316 --> 01:28:43,319
effects from the accident that would
be a factor in the way he performs.

1056
01:28:43,402 --> 01:28:46,906
I'm glad he's well enough to come back
and I hope I beat him at the same time.

1057
01:28:47,114 --> 01:28:48,216
You know, a lot of guys don't like him.

1058
01:28:48,241 --> 01:28:50,593
And it's just the situation
where the guy's got a lot of talent.

1059
01:28:50,618 --> 01:28:52,345
He's wide open,
he doesn't think about anything else,

1060
01:28:52,370 --> 01:28:54,038
he just wants to win. I like that.

1061
01:28:54,121 --> 01:28:58,292
Since the crash, he's been a danger
to himself and to other drivers.

1062
01:28:59,252 --> 01:29:02,672
But if he comes near me,
I'm going to put him in the wall.

1063
01:29:02,755 --> 01:29:04,423
Simple as that.

1064
01:29:04,799 --> 01:29:08,594
I don't expect I'll see too much of him.
Except in my rearview mirror.

1065
01:29:31,909 --> 01:29:33,202
Come in.

1066
01:29:38,791 --> 01:29:41,836
Harry said you wouldn't mind
if I stopped by.

1067
01:29:50,052 --> 01:29:54,056
How's Rowdy?
He's getting better every day.

1068
01:29:55,016 --> 01:29:56,450
Especially since you told him how much

1069
01:29:56,475 --> 01:29:59,770
you were looking forward
to getting in his race-car.

1070
01:30:00,146 --> 01:30:01,939
Sol lied.

1071
01:30:04,650 --> 01:30:06,193
What are you thinking?

1072
01:30:06,277 --> 01:30:09,572
Just how much I'd like to know
what you're thinking.

1073
01:30:12,450 --> 01:30:14,827
I guess everybody's the same.

1074
01:30:14,911 --> 01:30:18,998
You've got to be good at your job before
you can enjoy the rest of your life.

1075
01:30:19,081 --> 01:30:20,666
This is my job.

1076
01:30:22,001 --> 01:30:23,669
It's all I know.

1077
01:30:31,886 --> 01:30:34,472
You know I can't watch you do this.

1078
01:30:35,348 --> 01:30:36,599
Claire.

1079
01:30:38,309 --> 01:30:44,023
I'm more afraid of being nothing
than I am of being hurt.

1080
01:30:47,401 --> 01:30:48,819
Walk me out?

1081
01:30:52,615 --> 01:30:57,912
<i>We welcome you to the Daytona 500,
the Super Bowl of motor racing events.</i>

1082
01:30:57,995 --> 01:31:00,039
<i>Certainly among the favorites
for today's race</i>

1083
01:31:00,122 --> 01:31:04,335
<i>has to be Russ Wheeler driving the
number 18 Hardee's sponsored car.</i>

1084
01:31:04,418 --> 01:31:06,671
<i>He has certainly given race fans
something to talk about</i>

1085
01:31:06,754 --> 01:31:09,882
<i>after winning the pole for today's event.</i>

1086
01:31:09,966 --> 01:31:11,842
<i>But don't count out Cole Trickle,</i>

1087
01:31:11,926 --> 01:31:14,679
<i>who is returning to Daytona
for the first time</i>

1088
01:31:14,762 --> 01:31:17,974
<i>since his near-fatal accident here
last July.</i>

1089
01:31:20,518 --> 01:31:22,812
Told me you guys didn't have a sponsor.

1090
01:31:22,895 --> 01:31:26,899
Well, they gave us just about enough
money to put their name on the car.

1091
01:31:33,572 --> 01:31:35,533
Tim.
Cole.

1092
01:31:46,919 --> 01:31:50,506
Why is the hood up?
What's wrong with the car?

1093
01:31:50,589 --> 01:31:52,758
Take it easy.
We had to change engines.

1094
01:31:52,842 --> 01:31:55,761
We forgot to tighten the oil line.

1095
01:31:55,845 --> 01:31:59,432
Why did you have to change engines?
Found some metal in the oil filter.

1096
01:32:01,350 --> 01:32:04,770
Where did you get the engine?
Well, we stole it.

1097
01:32:10,568 --> 01:32:13,362
Claire, put the boy in his car,

1098
01:32:13,446 --> 01:32:17,116
tell him to get out on the track
before he starts sweating, all right.

1099
01:32:34,550 --> 01:32:37,720
So, you're going to get in your car
and take off?

1100
01:32:41,766 --> 01:32:43,392
Drive carefully.

1101
01:33:14,006 --> 01:33:16,675
<i>Gentlemen, start your engines.</i>

1102
01:33:32,858 --> 01:33:36,695
<i>We are underway.
The Daytona 500 is on.</i>

1103
01:33:45,538 --> 01:33:50,209
<i>We are 56 laps into this 200-lap event
and Russ Wheeler is in the lead.</i>

1104
01:33:51,335 --> 01:33:55,673
47:01 Lead is 45:90.
You're running last.

1105
01:34:01,554 --> 01:34:03,389
What's going on, Cole?

1106
01:34:07,184 --> 01:34:08,769
Are you all right?

1107
01:34:15,776 --> 01:34:19,071
<i>Just past the halfway mark
and Wheeler still leads.</i>

1108
01:34:32,418 --> 01:34:35,796
There's a crash at turn three,
and some oil at the bottom of the track.

1109
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:37,756
The lead is just taken.

1110
01:34:40,217 --> 01:34:43,304
<i>Cars are sliding down from the top
of the track, so watch yourself.</i>

1111
01:34:45,097 --> 01:34:48,642
You'd better go high, Cole.
Pick a line you can drive through.

1112
01:34:51,770 --> 01:34:56,108
Cole, are you all right?
Answer me, please.

1113
01:34:58,277 --> 01:35:01,447
Go around those wrecks.
You can drive through it.

1114
01:35:03,407 --> 01:35:05,784
<i>I know it. I know it in my heart.</i>

1115
01:35:19,215 --> 01:35:21,133
I'm through it, Harry!

1116
01:35:23,761 --> 01:35:25,346
I'm out of here.

1117
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:38,025
<i>Cole's moved up to ninth.
He's coming on strong.</i>

1118
01:35:38,984 --> 01:35:42,446
<i>Russ Wheeler in car number 18
continues to lead the way,</i>

1119
01:35:42,529 --> 01:35:45,282
<i>but the man on the move
is Cole Trickle.</i>

1120
01:35:51,330 --> 01:35:53,666
I'm gonna make a hole
to get through here.

1121
01:36:00,506 --> 01:36:01,548
Here we go.

1122
01:36:12,643 --> 01:36:15,980
Wheeler knocked me into Ganz.
Ganz spun out.

1123
01:36:20,985 --> 01:36:22,361
He's going high.

1124
01:36:24,863 --> 01:36:26,073
God damn it!

1125
01:36:26,156 --> 01:36:29,451
<i>And on the high side of the track,
Trickle takes the lead.</i>

1126
01:36:29,535 --> 01:36:30,786
Go, Cole!

1127
01:36:35,207 --> 01:36:37,167
This is it, this is what it's all about.

1128
01:36:40,379 --> 01:36:44,883
<i>With just 23 laps to go,
Cole Trickle is leading.</i>

1129
01:36:44,967 --> 01:36:47,469
<i>Take him now, Russ.</i>
He's all mine.

1130
01:37:01,108 --> 01:37:05,321
The accelerator is stuck, Harry.
It's stuck, it's on the floorboard.

1131
01:37:06,697 --> 01:37:08,365
I can't slow down.

1132
01:37:09,408 --> 01:37:12,911
Step on the clutch and let the
son of a bitch blow it. It's over, Cole.

1133
01:37:18,584 --> 01:37:19,960
Son of a...

1134
01:37:28,802 --> 01:37:29,928
Cole, you okay?

1135
01:37:30,012 --> 01:37:31,680
<i>The good news is
the accelerator is fixed,</i>

1136
01:37:31,764 --> 01:37:33,891
<i>the bad news is
the transmission is screwed.</i>

1137
01:37:33,974 --> 01:37:35,434
<i>I'm coming in.</i>

1138
01:37:49,823 --> 01:37:53,619
Are they out of the race, yet?
They will be in about 45 seconds.

1139
01:37:53,702 --> 01:37:54,870
That's the pace car.

1140
01:37:54,953 --> 01:37:58,290
Get me out in front of the pace car
or the race is over for us!

1141
01:37:58,374 --> 01:38:01,377
The linkage is all twisted.
Just give him the high gear.

1142
01:38:01,460 --> 01:38:03,045
Get me out there.

1143
01:38:04,129 --> 01:38:05,464
I got it.

1144
01:38:05,881 --> 01:38:07,883
Pace car's on its way.

1145
01:38:07,966 --> 01:38:09,385
Let's go.

1146
01:38:09,468 --> 01:38:12,429
Come on, man, come on.
Go! Go! Go!

1147
01:38:13,180 --> 01:38:16,475
Get out there and help them!
Go! Go! Go!

1148
01:38:26,527 --> 01:38:28,362
All right, all right, we made it.
Good work.

1149
01:38:29,488 --> 01:38:31,115
I owe you one.

1150
01:38:33,283 --> 01:38:35,577
Hey, you can't do that.
That's not your car.

1151
01:38:35,661 --> 01:38:38,247
It's my engine in that car,
I gave him that engine,

1152
01:38:38,330 --> 01:38:40,207
and that's what my boys are pushing.

1153
01:38:42,668 --> 01:38:46,255
<i>Cole, you better be at max speed
when the green flag drops.</i>

1154
01:38:50,884 --> 01:38:52,261
<i>The pace car pulls off the track.</i>

1155
01:38:52,344 --> 01:38:54,721
<i>The green flag is out
and racing resumes.</i>

1156
01:38:54,805 --> 01:38:56,598
<i>Wheeler broke away,
he's still in the lead.</i>

1157
01:39:02,729 --> 01:39:04,690
Where am I?
Running ninth.

1158
01:39:04,773 --> 01:39:06,900
How many laps to go?
Eight.

1159
01:39:12,739 --> 01:39:14,950
What's the interval
between me and Wheeler?

1160
01:39:15,033 --> 01:39:17,786
<i>Trickle's fifth and moving up fast, Russ.</i>

1161
01:39:27,713 --> 01:39:29,131
Remember me?

1162
01:39:35,721 --> 01:39:39,141
I'm going to draft Wheeler,
make him pull me around the track.

1163
01:39:42,769 --> 01:39:44,480
The son of a bitch is on my ass.

1164
01:39:48,066 --> 01:39:52,279
He's going to take me on the outside.
I'm going to put him in the wall.

1165
01:40:01,580 --> 01:40:04,917
What's going on, Cole?
I'm just setting him up, Harry.

1166
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,878
<i>There's the white flag. One lap to go.</i>

1167
01:40:07,961 --> 01:40:09,421
<i>Last lap, Cole.</i>

1168
01:40:22,851 --> 01:40:27,940
Don't keep this up, Cole, please.
Harry, this guy's going down.

1169
01:40:33,529 --> 01:40:36,657
Last turn, be careful. He's going to try
and slingshot past you, Russ.

1170
01:40:36,740 --> 01:40:40,118
Don't worry, I know Cole.
He always goes to the outside.

1171
01:40:41,828 --> 01:40:43,789
This one's for you, Harry.

1172
01:40:45,958 --> 01:40:47,793
He's going high.

1173
01:40:51,296 --> 01:40:52,839
He's going low!

1174
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:56,343
Son of a bitch!

1175
01:41:01,306 --> 01:41:04,601
<i>Here come the cars to the finish line,
it's Cole Trickle taking the win.</i>

1176
01:41:04,685 --> 01:41:06,228
All right! All right!

1177
01:41:45,684 --> 01:41:48,562
I thought you weren't gonna watch.
I lied.

1178
01:41:55,944 --> 01:41:58,238
Where's Harry?
I don't know.

1179
01:42:08,248 --> 01:42:09,541
Harry.

1180
01:42:12,794 --> 01:42:15,088
Harry, say something, will you?

1181
01:42:16,173 --> 01:42:18,091
I really can't. I can't.

1182
01:42:23,055 --> 01:42:26,808
You didn't know how this one
was going to turn out, did you?

1183
01:42:27,309 --> 01:42:29,061
It's like you said.

1184
01:42:31,438 --> 01:42:34,316
There's nothing you can't do
in a race-car.

1185
01:42:35,609 --> 01:42:39,071
We won. We won.
I know. Yeah.

1186
01:42:40,822 --> 01:42:44,785
Now, can you walk,
or am I going to have to carry you?

1187
01:42:44,868 --> 01:42:46,244
Where to?

1188
01:42:47,412 --> 01:42:50,582
Victory Lane.
Yeah.

1189
01:42:52,918 --> 01:42:54,920
Walk? Hell,

1190
01:42:58,298 --> 01:42:59,925
I'll race your ass.
