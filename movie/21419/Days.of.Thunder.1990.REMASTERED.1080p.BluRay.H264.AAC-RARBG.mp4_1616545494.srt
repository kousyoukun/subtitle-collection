1
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:41,740
雷霆壮志

2
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,340
欢迎莅临参观  地通拿500大赛
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Daytona 500,

3
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,680
超级碗机车大赛
the Super Bowl of motor racing events.

4
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,590
两届冠军
Walking onto the grid is the two-time

5
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,810
班洛甸正步向起点
Daytona 500 and defending champion Rowdy Burns.

6
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:28,310
他的劲敌是宾夕凡尼亚州车手  宾雅度
And perennial contender from Reading, Pennsylvania, Aldo Bennedetti.

7
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,620
各位选手，请开动引擎
Gentlemen, start your engines.

8
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,090
四十三号是帕列察…
Big turn back for number 43, Richard Petty.

9
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,420
帕列察遇上意外
Petty spins to the inside of the track.

10
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,260
转向赛道内侧
A tough break for Richard Petty.

11
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,550
帕列察中途退出大赛
Richard Petty is out of the Daytona 500.

12
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,510
著名领队霍哈利
Speaking of people who are out of the race,

13
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,470
没参加这届赛事
perhaps it's time to remember the legendary crew chief, Harry Hogge,

14
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:51,230
他的爱将白毕地在去年比赛…
whose great driver, Buddy Bretherton, died here last year in a fiery crash,

15
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,770
连人带车冲向墙边，车毁人亡
hitting the wall at over 195 miles an hour.

16
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,980
哈利，你在这里享受人生
So you're enjoying the good life, Harry?

17
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,190
对啊
Yeah.

18
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,320
我不讨厌施肥
I never minded spreading a little fertilizer around now and then.

19
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,070
有些工作比施肥更讨厌
There's worse things.

20
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,740
这部机车怎样？ 不错
- How's the truck running? - Runs good.

21
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,870
帮我装嵌一部车
I want you to build me a car.

22
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:21,880
添  汽车商人
Now, Tim, everybody knows some downtown car dealer

23
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,380
花不起钱派队参赛
can't afford a race team.

24
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,470
没有车手会跟你签约
No driver worth a damn is gonna sign with you.

25
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,390
如果车撞毁了  你没钱装嵌新车
'Cause they wreck one car, you can't afford to build them another

26
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,970
车手就要退出赛事
and they're out of the deal, you know.

27
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,730
没有车手
And no car's gonna win without a driver.

28
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,440
又怎能胜出
Not even mine.

29
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,690
你装嵌赛车，我会找车手
If you built the car, I'd get a damn driver.

30
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:46,280
赛季开始了  还会有什么车手？
What kind of driver are you going to find after the season's started?

31
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,790
剩下来的都是车场败将
Some old boy who's washed up and wasn't worth a shit to begin with.

32
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,410
你可以训练他
You can work with him.

33
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,000
训练车手就和装嵌赛车一样
You can build a driver like you build a car, Harry.

34
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,710
添，看看那头猎狗
Tim, take a look at that hound.

35
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,250
那是最出色的猎狗
That's the best coon dog I've ever seen or heard about.

36
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,050
我可从没有训练它  我找到车手了
- And I didn't teach him a damn thing. - Well, I got somebody.

37
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,510
谁？ 你去看看他
- Who? - Take a look at him.

38
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,390
若是好手早已经冒出头来
Anybody I gotta take a look at, ain't somebody.

39
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,600
那就看看这无名之辈吧
Then take a look at nobody.

40
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,810
我已经放弃赛车了，你知道的
Look, Tim, I gave up racing. You gotta know that. All right?

41
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,940
你没有放弃赛车
You didn't give up racing, Harry.

42
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,610
你不想他们调查白毕地的死因
You quit to avoid an investigation into Buddy's crash at Daytona.

43
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,860
我没有逃避调查
Hey, I didn't avoid any goddamn investigation.

44
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,160
我跟赛车会谈过
Anyway, I talked to NASCAR

45
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,660
如果你复出  他们不会调查旧事
and if you come back in there won't be any investigation.

46
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,960
你怎样说服他们？
How the hell did you sell them on that deal?

47
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,500
我是一流的推销员
I'm a hell of a salesman.

48
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,920
那才是真正的赛车手
Now, that's a racecar driver.

49
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,510
你的车手什么时候来？
When's your driver due?

50
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:55,140
哈利说你的选手  在印第安纳比赛
Harry tells me your guy runs those Indy type deals.

51
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,690
他参加短程赛
Yeah. Sprints, mainly.

52
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:00,150
赢了很多奖项
Two World of Outlaw championships, three all-star wins,

53
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,190
曾经连赢七次大赛  现在是赛车会会员
seven straight feature wins and he's been driving ASA.

54
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,380
嘿！
Hey.

55
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,240
做了不少统计
Got yourself a real statistician there.

56
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,490
他懂得发掘车手？
Does he know anything about drivers?

57
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,950
等着看好了
We'll see.

58
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,250
你那车手来自什么地方？
Harry, where'd you say your driver's from?

59
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,710
鹰石镇
Eagle Rock.

60
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,420
接近威斯波尔市？
It's up around Wilkesboro, isn't it?

61
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,630
不，接近格伦代尔市，加州
No. Glendale, California.

62
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,880
他是北方佬？
He's a Yankee?

63
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,470
加州人不算是北方佬
Not exactly. If you're from California, you're not a Yankee.

64
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,680
他们不伦不类
You're not really anything.

65
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,770
说得对
You said it.

66
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,700
避震器很好
The shocks are right, we're dialed in, buddy.

67
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,580
不必改动
Don't change a thing.

68
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:01,250
终于不再耕田
Hey, you ain't buried in horse manure after all.

69
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,750
你气色不错  你状态很好
- Looking pretty good. - You're the one who's looking good.

70
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,090
我花了不少工夫
It hadn't been easy, Harry, I'll guaran-damn-tee you,

71
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,050
现在它是最棒的
but this bitch is ready to run.

72
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,930
洛甸， 谢谢你
I can't tell you how much we all appreciate

73
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,430
借出这部车
you letting us use the car, Rowdy.

74
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,270
我跟你说过的
I told you about this, Rowdy.

75
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,520
哈利的新手
Harry's got some new driver

76
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,520
要借用它跑两个圈
and he needs a car just to turn a couple of laps.

77
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,860
霍哈利亲自请我们帮忙
I told you it was Harry Hogge who'd asked us personally, as a favor.

78
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,200
这新手是谁？
Who is this driver?

79
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,820
添说你一直参加短程赛
Tim tells me you've been running open-wheels.

80
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:08,780
对
That's right.

81
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,780
现在想参加长程比赛
And now you just want to up and drive NASCAR?

82
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,700
对
That's right.

83
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,740
你对这些比赛有什么认识？
What do you know about stock car racing?

84
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:19,120
我在电视上看过
Well, I've watched it on television, of course.

85
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,870
在电视上看过？
You've seen it on television?

86
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,920
体育台报导详尽
ESPN, the coverage is excellent.

87
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,090
我获益良多
You'd be surprised at how much you can pick up.

88
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,050
我相信你
I'm sure I would.

89
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:31,920
你还是别开这部车
Look, this may not be the best time for you to run this car.

90
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,340
有什么问题？
Was there some problem?

91
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,560
没有
No, sir. You all go right ahead.

92
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,350
开车吧，如果你弄坏我的车
But you bend this bitch the least little bit,

93
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,770
我会阉了你
I'm gonna tear your balls off.

94
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:54,530
请你替我… 拿着它
Okay. Would you mind very much holding on to this?

95
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,450
你听见了？
Didn't he hear what that man said?

96
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,830
慢着，我们要谈谈
Hold on a minute. Don't you think we ought to talk?

97
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,710
你想教我开车？好
What? About how I'm gonna run? Sure.

98
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,670
你竟然会活到今天
About how you've managed to live as long as you have.

99
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,590
你不能开这部车
Look, I ain't gonna let you race this car.

100
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:25,730
你怎么了？ 他改变主意
- What's going on? - He's had second thoughts.

101
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,310
-你答应我来看他  -已经看了
- You said you'd look at him. - I've looked at him.

102
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,070
我花了二千五百元租跑道
I paid $2,500 to use this track today, Harry.

103
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:34,360
他想找名牌赞助商、名牌车手
Forget it. He needs a brand name like Exxon or Richard Petty.

104
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:37,570
谁是好车手我看得出来
Well, I know a damn race driver when I see one.

105
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,620
怎么了？就此告吹？
What's going on, Harry? Is this happening or what?

106
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,910
请帮帮忙
Do us all a favor, Harry.

107
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,420
让我开车，我不会令你失望
Let me drive. I won't make a fool out of you.

108
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,810
隧道弯很危险
That tunnel turn's real tricky.

109
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,480
无论冷或暖，那里滑得要命
Now, whether it's hot or cold, it gets as slick as a butt.

110
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,150
稍一不慎
Then you'll slip and slide

111
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,110
就会撞向墙边
and slam yourself into the wall before you know it.

112
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,900
你要慢慢来
So just take it easy.

113
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,710
我要踩尽油门  不要
- I'm dropping the hammer. - No, you're not.

114
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,660
比洛甸还要快
It's under Rowdy's time.

115
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,410
还可以更快
Well, it might have been better if he cracked up the car.

116
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,640
很快  是吗？
- That was fast. - Yeah?

117
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,740
三十一秒
Thirty-one flat.

118
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:30,520
足以在上次赛事取胜
That's good enough to take the pole in the last race here.

119
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,980
真是难以置信
Hell, I thought this was gonna be a joke.

120
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,990
你从来没开过这类车？ 我开过短程车
- You never drove a stock car before? - No, sprints mainly.

121
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,390
你叫什么名字？ 白贝克，你呢？
- What's your name? - Buck Bretherton. What's yours?

122
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,620
我叫狄高，幸会
Cole Trickle. It's damn nice to meet you, Buck.

123
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,040
幸会，狄高
Damn nice to meet you, too, Cole.

124
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,200
你很幸运，拐隧道弯的时候
You were one lucky son of a bitch in that tunnel turn.

125
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,830
只差一点就会失控出事
That car was way out of shape.

126
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,210
靠运气？我可以再来一次
Well, if you think it was luck, let's do it again.

127
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,340
跑得很好  谢谢
- You run good. - Thank you.

128
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,380
比赛时你能否从车群中冲出来
Now, go get your own car and we'll see how you do in a crowd.

129
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,890
怎么不继续参加短程赛？
So, how come you don't stick to open wheels?

130
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,770
我被取消资格
I lost my ride.

131
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:12,140
赢了那么多赛事  你被解雇？
After two championships and seven straight wins, you were fired?

132
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,810
我被取消资格
I lost my ride.

133
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,320
难道我不能退出？
Doesn't matter. I'd have quit regardless.

134
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,070
为什么？ -继续下去也没意思
- Why's that? - I wasn't going anywhere.

135
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,950
-你想做什么？ 参加印第安纳赛事
- Where do you want to go? - Indianapolis.

136
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,070
但我没有好车
But you can't win in Indy without a great car.

137
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,570
不能参赛
And my name's not Andretti or Unser.

138
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,990
所有参赛的车都是一样
On the other hand, stock cars are stock cars. Pretty much the same.

139
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,000
它们才不一样
Hey, there's nothing stock about a stock car.

140
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,920
我无意冒犯你
Look, I'm not trying to insult you.

141
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,460
参赛跑车都是性能均等的
All I'm saying is, stock cars are built to run equal.

142
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,960
对吗？-规则上说
- Isn't that right? - So the rule books say.

143
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,420
所以我不必担心因为车的性能而败
So I don't have to worry about getting beat by another car.

144
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,590
只担心
In other words, all you have to worry about

145
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,390
被技术更好的车手打败
- is getting beat by other drivers. - Yeah.

146
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:50,310
你为我嵌车  我会成为地通拿冠军
You build me a car, and I'll win Daytona next year.

147
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:59,480
我把引擎安装得更贴近地面
I'm gonna give you an engine low to the ground.

148
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:04,280
把油盘加大，减低风阻
Extra-big oil pan that'll cut the wind from underneath you.

149
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:08,740
你会增强三、四十匹马力
That'll give you 30 to 40 more horsepower.

150
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:15,460
我会增加你的汽油储存量
I'm gonna give you a fuel line that'll hold an extra gallon of gas.

151
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,920
我会把你雕琢成子弹一样
I'm gonna shave half an inch off you and shape you like a bullet.

152
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,380
我们为你加油、喷漆  量度重量
And when we get you primed, painted and weighed,

153
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,970
然后你可以登上跑道，听到吗
you're going to be ready to go out on that racetrack. You hear me?

154
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,100
你将会十全十美
You're gonna be perfect.

155
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,020
(狄高)

156
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:40,130
(亚里桑那州，凤凰城)

157
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:49,180
我要好好教训这新手
Okay. I'm going to pull this rookie's chain.

158
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,270
你左摇右摆
Cole, you're wandering all over the track.

159
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,810
那杂种向我撞过来
Yeah. Well, that son of a bitch just slammed into me.

160
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,810
他没有撞你，也没有推你
No, he didn't slam into you, he didn't bump you, he didn't nudge you.

161
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:04,820
这叫做磨擦，磨擦乃兵家常事
He rubbed you, and rubbing, son, is racing.

162
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,080
沙板报销了
There goes the fender.

163
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,460
前沙板也报销了
There goes the quarter panel.

164
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,190
准备
All right. Get back!

165
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,360
好了，既然现在不准爬头
All right, while we're still under a caution,

166
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:55,910
你去撞领航车吧
I want you to go back out on that track and hit the pace car.

167
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,830
撞领航车？ 撞领航车
- Hit the pace car? - Hit the pace car!

168
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,210
为什么？
What for?

169
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,580
你什么车都撞过了
Because you hit every other goddamn thing out there.

170
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,920
只欠领航车  走吧…
I want you to be perfect. Now, go on. Go! Go! Go!

171
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,390
(田纳西州，布里斯托)

172
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,100
你得返回中线  混账
You're going too high. Stay in the group.

173
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,960
看看这里  至少不用修理这一边
How about that? This side we don't have to fix.

174
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,180
我不想宠坏你
I don't want you spoiled, Buck.

175
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:02,300
(特拉华州，多佛尔)

176
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,780
将会损伤惨重
This is gonna hurt.

177
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,860
跑开…
Move! Move! Move!

178
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,870
看到那家伙吗？
Did you see that guy?

179
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,930
(北卡罗来纳州，洛京咸)

180
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,340
我要回站
I've got to pit.

181
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,340
不行，我们很忙
I don't think so. We're busy now.

182
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,310
什么？ 我们在吃雪糕
- You're what? - We're eating ice cream.

183
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,120
吃雪糕？
Ice cream?

184
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,610
你可以来拿甜筒
Now, you're welcome to come on and get one,

185
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:56,740
但大会可能会
but I don't believe NASCAR

186
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,200
反对你吃雪糕
would think much of you trying to eat an ice cream cone out there.

187
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,750
只是开车你已经应付不来
You have enough trouble riding around the track as it is.

188
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,140
放松些
Take it easy.

189
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,310
高，别这样
Come on now, Cole!

190
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,600
高
Cole! Cole!

191
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,980
周日的赛事我们一塌糊涂
We messed up big-time on Sunday.

192
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,900
当时有赞助商在看台
I had sponsors in the stands

193
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,200
我跟他们握手
and I'm hugging and holding hands

194
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,490
我讨好他们  我希望你们有所表现
and kissing them in the air and praying for a good showing.

195
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,500
结果怎样？
And what do we do?

196
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:49,370
你们闹得天翻地覆
We end up looking like a monkey fucking a football out there.

197
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,800
请你们出去
Everybody out, please.

198
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,840
你们两个留下来
Except you two.

199
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,810
我有一个问题
I've got a question.

200
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:10,020
要做什么才可以胜出？
What is the one thing you absolutely need to do to win a race?

201
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,770
-很简单  -住口
- It's pretty damn obvious... - You keep quiet!

202
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,070
你要完成赛事
You need to finish the race.

203
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:18,820
添，我知道哈利是老行尊
Tim, I realize Harry's been around a long time.

204
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,530
我不是批评他落后
I'm not saying that his ways are antiquated

205
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,070
但他的引擎
but it'd help to have a car that handled properly

206
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,180
常常烧坏
and didn't blow engines.

207
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,830
他不停加快转速
Well, if he wouldn't get excited and over rev the son of a bitch,

208
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,620
引擎才会烧坏
the engine wouldn't blow.

209
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,630
高，转波的时候…
Now, Cole, when you shift the gear,

210
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,960
指针跳向红色地带
and that little needle on the tach goes into the red

211
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,170
指着九千转  那是凶兆
and reads 9,000 rpm, that's bad.

212
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:43,550
爆胎也是我的错
It's also my fault if the tires blow, if you ask this old fart.

213
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,930
当然是你的错
Well, hell yes, it's your fault.

214
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,640
其余四十位选手
There's 40 other vultures out there

215
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,770
都没有爆胎
who managed to finish the race on their tires.

216
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,650
你见过华丹卢爆胎吗？
You see Darrell Waltrip using up his tires?

217
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,440
赛车难不倒我
There's nothing I can't do with a racecar.

218
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,900
我可没办法
Well, that's the difference between you and me.

219
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,150
修好你的车  这很明显
- There's only so much I can do! - That's obvious.

220
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,070
哈利，他不需要明白你的工作
Harry, he doesn't need to appreciate your job to do his.

221
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,320
不了解赛车的性能
Well, he sure as hell does. How can he expect to race

222
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,160
他怎可以上场比赛？
if he don't know what a racecar can and can't do?

223
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,490
你想怎样？
What is this shit, huh?

224
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,080
我留在修理站，你去赛车？
You want me to work the pit and you drive?

225
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,040
好吧
Fine. We'll try that.

226
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:14,420
这杂种真是不可理喻
I can't talk to this son of a bitch.

227
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:21,090
这杂种不可理喻，我不能…
I can't talk to that son of a bitch. I really can't. I can't...

228
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:29,060
他可以出赛吗？
- You think he can drive? - He can drive.

229
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,060
当然可以，他把车胎、引擎
He can drive beyond the limits of the tires,

230
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,230
整架跑车都消耗尽
the engine, the car, anything else.

231
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:37,230
如果他肯听从我  我们就不会输
If the son of a bitch listened to me, we wouldn't hardly ever lose a race.

232
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:42,360
如果以后两场赛事  还找不到赞助商
If we don't get us a sponsor in the next couple of races,

233
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,240
我死定了
my ass is fried.

234
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:50,580
我会输掉所有生意
I'm liable to be out of the car business altogether.

235
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:54,670
哈利，你是有实力的  你也知道你有实力
And, Harry, I know you're great. You know you're great.

236
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,750
但车手不信任你
But if the guy in the car doesn't trust you,

237
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,420
我们无法取胜
we're never going to win a damn race.

238
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,650
哈利
Hey, Harry.

239
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,610
我们得谈谈，好吗？
We've gotta talk, all right?

240
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,910
好，说吧
All right, Harry. Talk.

241
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,490
在赛车时…
No. On the radio during the race.

242
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,830
如果想节节领先
Now, you wanna run right on the ragged edge all the damn time,

243
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:34,370
你要把跑车的状态说出来
you've got to tell us what's going on with the car.

244
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,330
你想改变我的驾驶方法
Or you just want to change the way I drive it.

245
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,430
可能吧
Maybe.

246
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,840
你应该改装跑车来迁就我
Well, maybe you can set up the car so I don't have to change.

247
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,130
好
I'd be happy to.

248
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,880
告诉我怎么改  你想知道什么？
- You just tell me how. - What do you want to know?

249
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,650
你才是司机
Well, hell, Cole, you are the driver.

250
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,090
你知道跑车的缺点
You think she's running loose or tight? Tell us.

251
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,180
我们调整它
We give a turn here, take some wedge out there,

252
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,060
去除旧患，这样就可以胜出
we'll win some races. That's all there is to it.

253
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,640
我办不到  为什么？
- I can't do that. - Why the hell not?

254
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,610
因为我听不懂你的话
Because I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

255
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,570
什么意思？
How do you mean that?

256
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,080
我不了解汽车，明白吗
Because I don't know much about cars, okay?

257
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,660
所有车手
Well, hey, Cole, that don't make you

258
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,790
都跟你一样
a damn bit different from any driver I ever met.

259
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,040
我是真的不了解汽车
No, I mean, I really don't know.

260
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,170
你说调整什么零件
I don't know what you just said about a turn here and a wedge there.

261
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,800
我一窍不通  完全不懂
- I don't know. I don't know. - How can that be?

262
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,130
有什么不同吗？
What's the difference?

263
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:30,220
他们叫我赛车，因为我会飚车
They told me to get in a car and drive. And I could drive.

264
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,850
我也想帮你，但无能为力
The point is, I'd like to help out but I can't.

265
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:35,810
我没知识，什么也说不出来
I'm an idiot. I don't have the vocabulary.

266
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,570
-这样…  -怎样？
- Well... - Well?

267
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,860
我们得想个办法，对不对？
We're just gonna have to figure one out, aren't we?

268
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,870
不用担心
Don't worry about it.

269
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,040
好吧
All right?

270
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,640
它怎样？
How does she feel?

271
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,840
屁股摆来摆去
Her ass is all over the place.

272
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:08,300
车尾摇摆不定，车速太快
Well, the rear end's loose. Car's fast.

273
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:12,010
你开得太快，快要失控
"Loose" is fast, and "on the edge," you're out of control.

274
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:18,350
还有一件事
Now, Cole, there is something else.

275
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,480
轮胎是取胜的关键
Tires is what wins a race.

276
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,030
你说什么？
Yeah. What the hell are you talking about?

277
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:30,450
如果车胎过热
If we can't figure you a way to run so you don't melt the damn tires,

278
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,200
便跑不完全程
we can't finish a race.

279
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,870
你想怎样？
So, what do you want?

280
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,410
用你的方法
I'll tell you what,

281
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:39,920
跑五十圈  然后用我的方法跑五十圈
you run 50 laps any way you like, then 50 laps like I want you to.

282
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,380
诚实地比试一下，我会打败你
Give me an honest run. If you do, I'm gonna beat you.

283
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,060
现在用我的方法跑五十圈
All right. Now we're going to do it 50 laps my way, all right?

284
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,770
你在印第安纳作赛的时候
Now, when you were racing Indy cars out west,

285
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:09,780
轮胎宽一倍，车身轻一倍
the tires were twice as wide and the car weighed half as much.

286
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:13,910
现在车身重一倍，轮胎窄一倍
Now your car weighs twice as much and the tires are half as wide

287
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,910
你令车胎过度受热
and you're burning them up, all right.

288
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:18,080
它们会溶化
Now, if you do... When you burn them up, they melt,

289
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,790
变得滑溜
when they melt, they get greasy and you slip and slide.

290
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:23,880
你会滑胎失控  明白了？
And you're out of control. All right?

291
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:25,810
去吧  好了
Let's go!

292
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:42,560
他的方法  我的方法
His way, my way.

293
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,980
我的方法快了六秒
I was six seconds faster.

294
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:48,400
去公路餐厅请我吃午餐吧
You can buy me some lunch at the highway joint, Tim.

295
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,750
(南卡罗来纳州，达令顿)

296
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:04,750
怎么了？
What's wrong?

297
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,230
我们要谋求对策
We're trying to figure out what to do.

298
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,800
什么事？ 什么事？我们有麻烦了
- About what? - About what? We're in trouble.

299
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,340
洛甸的圈速是30.25秒
Rowdy took the pole in 30.25.

300
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,510
我们是31.10秒  慢了差不多一秒
We run 31.10. We're almost a second off the pace.

301
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,350
要想办法令它跑得更快
We're looking for some speed out of this.

302
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,770
这跑车已经十全十美
The car's perfect, Harry.

303
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,160
本季首个赛事
It's the first race of the season here

304
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,530
在达令顿赛道举行
at the legendary Darlington International Speedway.

305
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,080
最危险的地方是四号弯角
And the most treacherous turn is number four.

306
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,960
圈速落后了零点一秒
30:90. Leader's 30:80.

307
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,500
你排第十二位  -还有三十圈
You're running 12th. Thirty laps to go.

308
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,680
-谢谢
Thanks, Harry.

309
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,350
轮胎会过热，你要慢下来
You're gonna burn the damn tires, Cole. So take it easy.

310
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:05,770
我没有加速，是其他人慢了
Harry, I'm not going faster. Everybody else is going slower.

311
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,440
他说得对，我们测了圈速
He's right, Harry. I checked his lap times.

312
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,650
是其他人的圈速减慢了
We just haven't fallen off as much as everybody else.

313
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:13,820
对，你做得很好
That's right. You're doing good, Cole. You're doing real good.

314
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,820
你排第五位
You're running fifth

315
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,320
圈速比第一位快半秒
and you're gaining half a second a lap on the leader.

316
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,510
还要跑十五圈
Fifteen to go.

317
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,920
不要在四号弯角抢外线
Don't pass on the outside of turn four.

318
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,840
对了，走内线  还有十圈
That's right. Stay to the inside, Cole. Ten laps to go.

319
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,430
狄高升至第二位
And Trickle has moved into the number two spot,

320
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,010
紧随班洛甸
right behind Rowdy Burns.

321
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,310
-我追着第一位  -还有五圈
- I'm right behind the leader. - Five laps to go.

322
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,860
记得我吗？
Remember me?

323
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,190
你做什么？
What in the hell's going on?

324
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,530
轻轻磨擦对手  磨擦乃兵家常事
Just a little rubbing, Harry. Rubbing's racing.

325
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,910
我要和这新丁作个了断
I'm going to take this rookie once and for all.

326
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,130
好了，够了
All right, God damn it. That's enough!

327
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,920
别惹洛甸
You can't play with Rowdy like this.

328
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,590
他不会放过你
He's gonna give you a real ass ripping.

329
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,800
别紧张
Just relax, Harry.

330
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:24,220
两雄相遇，最后洛甸被撵走
Somebody's got to give. And it's Rowdy Burns who's out!

331
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,180
他竟然卷土重来
No! An incredible recovery by Rowdy.

332
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,770
继续比赛
He retains his position on the lead lap.

333
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,150
现在由狄高领先
And we have a new leader.

334
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:34,900
他开着46号雪佛莱
Cole Trickle in the number 46 City Chevrolet Car.

335
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,940
车手暂时不准爬头，剩下三圈
We're under caution with three laps to go.

336
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:41,360
暂时不准爬头，回修理站  为什么？我快要冲线了
- Caution's out. Come on in. - What for? It's almost over.

337
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:45,040
你跑了六十八圈  总要回修理站
You've been on the green for 68 laps. Everybody's got to pit, Cole.

338
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,380
快点…
Go, go! Go, go!

339
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,340
气枪坏了，拿枪来
The air gun's jammed, give me another one.

340
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,800
给我拿气枪
- Give me a gun. Give me a gun. - It's jammed.

341
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,300
快点
Come on, switch it, guys.

342
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,470
快点  换胎吧
Let's go!

343
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,230
混账，快点… 装上去吧
Damn it! Go! Go! Go! Go. Get them on quick!

344
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:29,790
该死，狗娘养的
God damn it! Son of a bitch!

345
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,370
-高…  -狗娘养的
Now, Cole...

346
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:40,090
-狗娘养的  -我们听到你说话
- Son of a bitch! - Cole, we're on the air, all right?

347
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:42,180
本来跑第一位
I come into the pit, I'm in first place.

348
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,390
现在变第三位，只剩下两圈
I go out, I'm in third with two laps to go.

349
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:46,640
先冷静下来
All right. First of all, don't get excited, all right.

350
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,180
第三位是好位置
You're in third place. That's a pretty respectable position.

351
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,320
你要这样做…
Now, what you do is this.

352
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,440
他们在四号弯角减速
When they slow down into turn four,

353
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,850
你加速
you just keep your foot on the gas

354
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,730
在外线爬头
and drive right by them on the outside.

355
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:59,860
你说没有人会在四号弯抢外线
Harry, you told me, nobody goes to the outside on turn four.

356
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,570
我改变口风
Well, now I'm telling you different.

357
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:04,530
走外线吧，你不会失控
If you go to the outside, you can hold it.

358
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,110
他会撞向墙边
He's going to end up in the wall.

359
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,780
领航车快要离开
All right. Cole, the pace car is about ready to duck on off.

360
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,490
我们没时间考虑
We don't have a whole lot of time to talk about this.

361
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,700
为什么不会失控
Well, tell me how.

362
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:14,210
我们为你换了特制轮胎
It's 'cause we've got a real good set of match tires on.

363
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,920
什么？
- What? - What?

364
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,670
这些轮胎完美匹配
Those tires are matched perfect and staggered special.

365
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,460
你会害死他
You're gonna get him killed.

366
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,630
领航车快要离开
Pace car's about ready to duck on off.

367
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,760
跑外线吧，不会出轨的
If you go to the outside, you can hold it.

368
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,660
好吧，你比我更了解这部车
All right, Harry. When it comes to the car I'll take your word.

369
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,770
白旗出来了，这是最后一圈
The white flag is out. One lap to go.

370
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:59,120
我看那小子不敢抢外线爬头
The boy don't have the balls to pass me on the outside.

371
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:04,470
他们直闯四号弯角
And they're heading into treacherous turn four.

372
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,660
好
Yes!

373
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:34,660
狄高首次胜出
And Cole Trickle wins his first ever NASCAR victory.

374
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,290
班洛甸得第二名
Second place goes to Rowdy Burns.

375
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:48,590
狄高
Cole Trickle...

376
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,090
你知道
Cole, did you have any idea

377
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,760
自己能够
you could run the car wide open into that last turn

378
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,260
在急弯爬头？
and make it stick like that?

379
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:55,480
我信心十足
- I knew it all along. - How's that?

380
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:59,100
嗯，在最后一站，当我进来时，哈里倒换上了特殊轮胎
Well, in our last stop, when I came in, Harry put on special tires.

381
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,440
特制轮胎？它们有什么特点？
Special tires? Harry Hogge, what's special about them?

382
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,610
没什么特别…
Well, nothing in particular.

383
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,690
霍哈利要向车手好好解释
Looks like Harry Hogge has a little explaining to do.

384
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,320
但你说…
You told me...

385
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,570
我说谎
I lied. I had to tell you something to calm you down.

386
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,120
这样你才会冷静下来
You were acting like such a candy-ass.

387
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,330
气枪故障，你气急败坏  没法子专心比赛
After the air gun stuck, I figured you'd never get back on the racetrack.

388
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:17,830
你这狗娘养的
You son of a bitch!

389
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:25,380
试戴这顶帽子  我们找到赞助商了
Try this on for size. We've got ourselves a sponsor.

390
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,430
答应我一件事
Promise me one thing, boys,

391
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:35,060
无论怎样，定要赢地通拿大赛
whatever else we do from here, we win Daytona.

392
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,180
-好  -一言为定  一言为定
That's a promise. That's a promise.

393
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:47,740
出售毫无价值的矿场股票
Selling thousands of dollars worth of useless mining stock

394
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:50,820
简直是挂羊头卖狗肉
and they call that a dog and pony show.

395
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:55,660
你觉得可笑  一旦发生在你身上  你就笑不出来
It may be funny, but it's not that funny when it happens to you, son.

396
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,410
的确发生在我身上
It happened to me.

397
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,210
你买了矿场股票？
What? You bought worthless mining stock?

398
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:05,380
我被取消赛车资格
I told you I lost my ride.

399
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,590
因为
That's how I lost it.

400
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:11,590
车队的老板是老千
Team owner was a conman. Junk bonds, worthless companies.

401
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:15,050
他出售偷回来的游艇
But mainly he sold stolen yachts.

402
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:19,930
我赢了赛事  他利用我的名气促销
When I won enough races, he even used my name to promote the sales.

403
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,600
结果他坐牢，我不能赛车
He went to jail and I lost my ride.

404
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,610
真是羞耻
It was pretty humiliating, actually.

405
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:31,740
你被卑鄙小人陷害
Hell, Cole, there's no need to be embarrassed

406
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:36,410
不必觉得羞耻
by some lowlife, piece of trash who put you in that kind of position.

407
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:39,040
那要看情形
- Well, Harry, that depends. - On what?

408
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:43,960
你是否和那个卑鄙小人有亲戚关系，一个垃圾人
On whether or not you're related to that lowlife, piece of trash.

409
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,250
他是我父亲
He was my father.

410
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,050
自从那次之后
I've never really stuck with anything since.

411
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:57,600
他们不相信我，我也不信他们
They don't trust me, I don't trust them.

412
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:00,390
这个你最清楚
You know how that goes.

413
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,350
举例说
Like for instance,

414
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:05,360
你今天对我说谎
you lied to me today.

415
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,360
没有撞车送命是我好运
It was dumb luck I didn't end up crashed or dead.

416
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:12,780
我应该揍你一顿  是吗？ 来吧
- I ought to punch you out. - Yeah? Give it a try.

417
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,580
不
No.

418
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:23,830
跟六十岁老翁打架？
Don't wanna get my ass kicked by a 60-year-old man.

419
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,580
五十九岁
Fifty-nine.

420
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:28,800
哈利，教训他  高，加油
- Whoop his ass, Harry. - Come on, Cole.

421
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,680
他占了上风
Oh, God. Come on.

422
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:44,190
车手不应该抢外线爬头
Drivers just don't go to the outside like that, Cole.

423
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:47,520
但我知道你应付得来  我知道的
But I knew you could do it. I knew it.

424
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,780
我对你有信心
I believed it in my heart.

425
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:59,080
桃还是樱桃？ 樱桃
- Peach or cherry? - Cherry.

426
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,460
你是独一无二的
I'm taking a leak.

427
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,500
有深谋远虑的车手
There you see now, there's calculating drivers,

428
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,840
也有英勇无畏的车手
and then there's kamikaze drivers.

429
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,590
高就像我父亲，勇者无惧
And our Cole here's a kamikaze, like my pappy was.

430
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:17,840
谁是你父亲？ 白毕地
- And who's that? - Buddy Bretherton.

431
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,180
白毕地是你父亲？ 是
Buddy Bretherton was your dad?

432
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:25,350
他在地通拿大赛去世  是去年的事
- He died at Daytona, didn't he? - Last year.

433
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,860
是什么原因？ 撞向墙边
- How did it happen? Mind my asking? - He hit the wall.

434
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,520
哪个弯口？
Which turn?

435
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:33,610
可能在撞墙前去世
He was probably dead before he hit it.

436
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:36,990
法医官说他心脏病发
The coroner's report showed massive heart attack.

437
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,380
我们被截停了
I believe we've been pulled over.

438
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,720
所有人下车面壁站好
All right. Everybody out and up against the wall here.

439
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,310
你们被捕了
You're under arrest.

440
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:04,310
立刻下车
Let's go. Move it.

441
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:09,020
什么事？ 你拿着的东西
- What the hell for? - It's right there in your hand.

442
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,520
非法运酒越过州界
Transportation of illegal alcohol across state lines

443
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,320
作贩卖用途
for the purpose of distribution.

444
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,030
你误会了，长官
Well, I don't know what this looks like to you, Officer,

445
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,990
我们没卖酒，我们不过在喝酒
but this is not distribution. This is consumption.

446
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,400
那仍然是犯法
Well, that don't exactly make it legal.

447
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:20,410
你应该清楚
You know what...

448
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:21,700
转身站好
Now up against the wall.

449
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:25,290
什么事？ 面壁站好
- What... What is this? - Up against the wall!

450
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,630
长官
Officer?

451
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,340
找到一些东西
Well, looks like we've found something.

452
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:41,340
-什么？ -他藏着武器
- What's that? - A concealed weapon.

453
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:45,100
在哪里？ 这里
- Where? - Right here.

454
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,820
余下来的问题是…
Now, the only question is,

455
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:02,240
他会否动用武器？ 好…
will he actually use it?

456
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,800
不要生气
Please don't be mad.

457
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,010
他们说你可能喜欢我
Harry and the boys just thought you might like me.

458
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,740
这里是佛罗里达州地通拿
Here we are for summer speed weeks in Daytona Beach, Florida.

459
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:32,600
今天举行
It's the Firecracker 400.

460
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,440
新晋车手狄高备受瞩目
And the favorite here today is newcomer Cole Trickle

461
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,280
驾驶46号雪佛莱
in the number 46 Superflo Chevrolet.

462
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,700
赛车史上最厉害的年轻车手
He's the hottest young rookie in NASCAR history

463
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:44,620
六场比赛胜出五场，史无前例
and has won an unprecedented five out of his last six races.

464
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,090
别对着洛甸的倒后镜扮鬼脸
Stop playing peek-a-boo in Rowdy's rearview mirror.

465
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,590
不要再这么幼稚
I thought you boys would've had enough of that by now.

466
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,100
我没有看他的倒后镜
I'm not doing anything like that, Harry.

467
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,150
你做什么？
Well, then what are you doing?

468
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:19,730
他冲过来  撞松了自己的灭音器
He rubbed me the wrong way and loosened his bumper!

469
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,530
我帮他脱下整个灭音器
I'm just gonna have to come all the way out.

470
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,240
他的泵把
Try that and his rear bumper's liable to go through the radiator

471
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,010
会撞坏你的水箱
and take you out of the whole damn race.

472
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,540
泵把松脱就要退出比赛
That bumper gets any looser, Rowdy, they're gonna black-flag you.

473
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,640
让他走吧
Let him go by.

474
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,540
他挥手让我爬头，我走外线
He's waving me by, I'm gonna take him on the high side.

475
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,190
你担心什么？
What are you so worried about, Harry?

476
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,570
你令我吓一跳，做得好
Well, you surely got my attention. Great driving, great recovery, Cole.

477
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:15,210
狄高紧随51号的班洛甸
Cole Trickle now right behind the number 51 car of Burns,

478
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:17,330
再次展开龙争虎斗
and they go at it again.

479
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:29,060
四号弯角撞车
There's a crash coming out of turn four, Cole.

480
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:36,350
我看到了
I see it!

481
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,980
-你听到吗？ -我看不见
Can you hear me?

482
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:11,300
请摇动手指
- I can't see anything. - Wiggle your fingers for me.

483
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,100
和脚趾
Wiggle your toes.

484
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,640
我什么也看不见
I can't see anything.

485
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,770
我没事
I'm all right. Take this off.

486
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:23,980
他怎么了？
Hey, what do we got?

487
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,030
接上监察器
Hook up the other monitor.

488
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,820
我不是电池，不用充电
I'm not a car battery. I don't need recharging.

489
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,780
放松，这是正常程序
Relax, it's just standard procedure.

490
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:35,410
去你的  你说什么？
- Hey, you go screw yourself, okay? - What was that, Mr. Burns?

491
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:37,960
我不是说你
- I wouldn't tell you to do that, Doc. - We'll see.

492
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,240
发生什么事？
- What's going on? - Keep your head down.

493
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,660
你在医院
- Relax. - You're in a hospital.

494
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,360
我盲了
I can't see.

495
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,880
发生什么事？
God, tell me what's going on! I'm blind, God damn it!

496
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,930
你叫什么名字？ -什么？
- What's your name? - What...

497
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:54,060
-你叫什么名字？ 狄高
- What's your name? - Cole. Cole.

498
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:57,430
高，请不要动
Cole, would you help us out and lie still, please?

499
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:01,440
-送他到扫瞄房  -是
- C-spine and CAT scan, right away. - Yes, Doctor.

500
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,020
可否摇动你的手指？
Can you move your fingers for me?

501
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,280
他脑部受了震荡
Just tell him he's had a concussion.

502
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,160
有瘀伤和肿胀
His brain is bruised, and like any bruise, it's gonna swell.

503
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,620
所以他的视力受了影响
Now that swelling is almost certainly what's affecting his vision.

504
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:21,750
你的脑部受到震荡
You have a concussion and your brain is bruised

505
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:24,740
有瘀伤和肿胀  所以你的视力受影响
and it's going to swell. It's certainly gonna affect your vision.

506
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,050
我会恢复视力吗？
You mean this will go away?

507
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:29,920
告诉他我们会继续检查
Tell him we're gonna run some tests to confirm everything.

508
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:33,340
他的头盔有没有爆裂？
What did his helmet look like and was it cracked?

509
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:35,610
没有
No.

510
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,140
有没有划痕？ 你是脑科医生？
- Was it scratched? - Are you a brain doctor?

511
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,600
头盔前面还是后面有划痕？
Was the helmet scratched at the front or the back?

512
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:46,470
我相信前后都有
I believe it was scratched in the back and the front.

513
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,530
你是脑科医生？
Are you a brain doctor?

514
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,490
请跟我说话
Could someone talk to me?

515
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,700
赛车时有人用无线电跟我说话
When I'm driving, I got a guy on the radio who talks to me.

516
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,080
我看不见他
I can't see him.

517
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,000
但他会跟我说话
But he talks to me.

518
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:06,790
别担心，我们会照顾他
Don't worry, we're going to take care of him.

519
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,530
哈利
Harry.

520
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,960
你没事吧  没事，为什么？
- Are you okay, Harry? - Yeah. Why?

521
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:50,630
你看来弯弯曲曲的
You look all bent out of shape.

522
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:57,640
是我的眼睛有问题吧
Hell, it's probably just my eyes.

523
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,470
是我变形了，我整晚留在这里
No, it's me, I've been here all night.

524
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,810
他们给我吃什么药
Jesus. What are they giving me here?

525
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,480
哈利，发生什么事？
Harry, what happened?

526
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:11,820
在跑道上打转的时候…
Rowdy was spinning across the track.

527
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,570
我应该往前直冲
The rule is you go straight for them.

528
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:20,280
我没有放慢速度
So I never took my foot off the gas.

529
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:29,210
前面那部车早应该离开了  但它还在那里
He should have been gone by the time I got there, man, but he wasn't.

530
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:34,300
另一部车撞你  然后撞向班洛甸
I think another car hit you and knocked you into Rowdy.

531
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:38,140
那部车突然冒出来
- He came out of nowhere. - Yeah.

532
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:41,760
这是很罕有的意外
It's one of those things that never happens.

533
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,730
别想它了
I wouldn't even think about it, you know.

534
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,480
我去找医生来  我觉得很好  好
- I'll get the doctor. - I feel great.

535
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,410
高
Cole.

536
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:12,800
见到你真好，高
Damn nice to see you, Cole.

537
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:15,190
你好吗？
How you doing, buddy?

538
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,880
见到你真好，贝克
It's damn nice to see you, Buck.

539
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:20,090
你觉得怎样？
How you doing?

540
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,180
高，你见过廖医生了
Cole, you've met Dr. Lewicki.

541
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,640
她是你的医生，廖医生
That's your doctor, Dr. Lewicki.

542
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:33,230
当时他看不见我
I don't think he's actually seen me before.

543
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,820
哈利，你又来了
Sure, Harry.

544
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:38,900
-不  -廖医生
- No... - Dr. Lewicki.

545
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:45,700
医生袍、听筒  这套戏服很逼真
Smock, stethoscope. It's a great costume, Harry.

546
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:50,580
医生，你好吗？ 高，她真是廖医生
- So how are you, Doc? - No, Cole, this really is Dr. Lewicki.

547
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,750
我本来下班了
I was just about to go off duty.

548
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,500
但你想来看看我
You thought you'd come by to look me over.

549
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:59,630
来检查一下，你恢复视力了？
Well, it's not a bad idea. I figure your vision's restored?

550
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,800
看来是的
I think so.

551
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:04,310
有没有看到模糊、重迭的影像
Nothing's blurred? You're not seeing double?

552
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:07,930
有没有看到光晕和闪光？
No haloes around objects? Flashing lights?

553
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:13,690
慢着，你想做什么？ 看你的眼睛
- What are you going to do with this? - Look into your eyes.

554
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:16,780
医生
Doc, Doc.

555
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:22,280
你不是要找这东西吗？
Isn't this what you're really looking for?

556
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,790
很有趣
Well, that's interesting enough, Mr. Trickle,

557
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:30,370
但这不是我的专科
but it's just not my specialty.

558
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:44,300
她真的是医生？
She's the real thing?

559
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:48,220
我怎会在这时候作弄你
Well, I wouldn't play no joke on you in a situation like this.

560
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,270
对不起，我本来也不想笑的
Sorry, Cole, I'm trying not to smile.

561
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:53,600
给我滚
All right, get out.

562
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:56,690
走吧…
Get out. Get out of here.

563
00:44:56,770 --> 00:44:58,480
再见
Get some rest, man.

564
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,070
我不对劲
I am not well.

565
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:08,790
我走得动
I can walk, God damn it.

566
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:12,040
医院不准你走路
Not as long as you're in this hospital you can't.

567
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:18,040
我不想见到他，请推快一点
I don't want to be next to this clown. You mind picking up the pace a little?

568
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:21,880
要药的话，你要找护士
Hey, man, if you want drugs, you have to see the nurse. Okay?

569
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:44,610
等待
Wait!

570
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,880
我的天
Get out of the way.

571
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:12,520
早安，两位先生  跟我来
Good morning, gentlemen. Right this way.

572
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:19,610
班先生和狄先生
So, neither Mr. Burns, nor in this case, Mr. Trickle

573
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:21,940
颅骨以内都没有受损
present any significant intracranial injury.

574
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:24,700
慢着，请简单地告诉我
Now hold it, Doc. Let's have that one in English.

575
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,780
他们有没有撞坏脑？
Did they mess up their squash or not?

576
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:31,080
脑部没有受损  至少跟意外发生前一样
Their brains are intact. As much as they were before the accident anyway.

577
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,330
你准许他们继续赛车？
You're willing to give them clearance to get back on a racetrack?

578
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:36,000
赛车是危险玩意
Well, that's obviously a dangerous way to spend your time.

579
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:39,540
我不想听哲学理论  我要医学意见
That's a philosophical objection, Doc, and I'm looking for a medical one.

580
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,000
我暂时不会准许他们赛车
I'm not inclined to give them clearance at this time.

581
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:45,880
废话  稍安勿躁
- That's total horseshit. - Gentlemen, please.

582
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:50,220
他们想听取别的医生的意见
I think they're saying they would like another opinion.

583
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,310
我们想见你的上司
We would like to talk to your boss.

584
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:55,980
你可以这样做  但我和韦医生
You're welcome to, of course, but Dr. Wilhaire and I have consulted

585
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:58,100
有一致的看法
and we're of the same opinion.

586
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:00,980
一至两周后再评估他们的情况
Which is a re-evaluation in a week or two.

587
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:02,160
谢谢，医生
Thank you, Doc.

588
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:04,190
我想跟他们说话
Now, we have a little something we have to say to the boys here

589
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:06,420
你不必留下来
and I don't think you necessarily need to hear it.

590
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:15,580
现在由大哥尊说话
Okay, Big John's turn.

591
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:24,550
如果你们想撞车死掉
If you wanna turn yourselves into a greasy spot

592
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:27,380
没问题
on a country road somewhere, go right ahead.

593
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,510
没有人会关心
I don't give a shit and I don't think anybody else does,

594
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:31,430
你们的死活
regardless of what they say to your face.

595
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:35,220
但不要在我的赛道生事
But you two monkeys are not going to do it on my racetrack.

596
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,270
你们听过日式检查吗？
Have you all heard of Japanese inspection?

597
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:41,730
日式检查
Japanese inspection.

598
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:43,730
日本人
You see, when the Japs get in a load of lettuce

599
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:46,360
不想外国生菜进口
that they're not sure they want to let in the country,

600
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,400
他们让生菜搁在码头
why, they just let it sit on the docks

601
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:51,110
日后才去检查
until they get good and ready to look at it.

602
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:55,740
后来所有生菜都腐坏了
By then of course, it's all gone rotten. Ain't nothing left to inspect.

603
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:59,540
生菜是容易腐坏的货品
In other words, lettuce is a perishable item

604
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,630
你们也一样
like you two monkeys.

605
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,630
如果你们再互相碰撞
You trade paint one more time, you so much as touch,

606
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:07,760
我会取消你们的资格
I'm gonna black-flag the two of you.

607
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,800
没收跑车
Gonna take apart your racecar for 300 laps.

608
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,340
等你们通过健康检查
Then if you pass the inspection,

609
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:16,770
重造跑车  我可能会让你们出赛
and you put your car back together, I might let you get back in the race.

610
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,850
你们要冰释前嫌
Now, just to show us there's no hard feelings,

611
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:22,400
今晚一起吃晚饭
we're all gonna go out to dinner together.

612
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,020
-我有别的约会  -我也一样
- I've got other plans. - Yeah, and so do I.

613
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,440
取消约会
Well, you're gonna have to change them.

614
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:31,200
你们要一起开车去餐厅
And not only that, you two are gonna drive to dinner together.

615
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,660
廖医生
Dr. Lewicki.

616
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:43,830
我想为高
I want to apologize for what happened with Cole

617
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,630
的行为道歉
when you come into the hospital room.

618
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:49,800
霍先生，不必介怀
Mr. Hogge, please, it's nothing to worry about.

619
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,510
你没有做错
And in any case it was hardly your doing.

620
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:54,470
我要负上责任
Well, that's just it, I believe it was.

621
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:57,970
不久前，狄高赢了达令顿大赛
You see, not too long ago after he won Darlington,

622
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,060
我们捉弄他
we played a trick on Cole.

623
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:04,690
我们找一位美女扮作公路女警
We dressed up a pretty girl in a highway-patrol uniform.

624
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:10,610
我们请她挑逗狄高
Anyway, we told her to get real ornery with him and she did.

625
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:14,240
你的意思是…  她真的挑逗狄高
- By ornery, you mean... - I mean, real ornery.

626
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:19,620
为什么告诉我这件事？
Why would you want me to know about this?

627
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:22,830
我不想你对高起了反感
I don't want you to hold a bad opinion of Cole.

628
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:24,960
他会害怕
I believe it scares him.

629
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:29,210
他需要你给他信心
He needs reassurance from you that he's okay.

630
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:33,380
毕竟你是他的医生
After all, you're his doctor.

631
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:39,510
我说完了
That's it.

632
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,910
医生
Doc.

633
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:05,710
有人说你误会我是公路女警
I heard you thought I was a highway-patrol officer.

634
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:10,840
谢谢你照顾我
I also want to thank you for taking care of me.

635
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,460
那是我的职责
It's my job.

636
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:15,130
你救了我
It's my life.

637
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:19,430
这次我们握手吧
Well, this time let's shake hands.

638
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:22,470
好  祝你好运  对不起
- Of course. Of course. - Good luck, Cole.

639
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:36,320
廖医生  我可以再见你吗？ 你一定会再见到我
- Dr. Lewicki, could I see you? - You will, I promise.

640
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:38,030
我的意思是…
No, I mean,

641
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:41,580
一起吃饭、看戏  我带你看赛车
have some dinner, go catch a movie. I'll take you to a race.

642
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,290
谢谢你邀请我
That's very sweet, really,

643
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:47,210
但我不会让你提早回跑道赛车
but it won't get you back on the track any faster.

644
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:52,500
不是…  我没有这想法
No, it's not what I meant.

645
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:19,490
你想怎样？ 我们要解决一个问题
- You got me here, now what? - Here's how I see this deal.

646
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:22,870
我不会让你开车去餐厅
Since you agree I ain't gonna let you drive this car to dinner

647
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:25,630
你也不会让我开车去餐厅
and I agree you ain't gonna let me drive this car to dinner,

648
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:27,580
只有一个解决方法
there's only one way to settle this.

649
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,790
你说什么？
What are you talking about?

650
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,540
(汽车出租)

651
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:36,260
好主意
Absolutely.

652
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:19,010
添，听着
Let me tell you something, Tim.

653
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:23,350
如果你不能管束你的车手
If you can't control your race drivers any better than this,

654
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:28,060
你还是别做领队好了
you might consider sticking to something you can control.

655
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:33,400
回沙洛特-加龙省卖二手车吧
Like used cars in downtown Charlotte.

656
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:59,010
不算太迟
- Too close to call? - Yeah.

657
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:15,270
你迟到了  车有毛病
- You're late. - We had car trouble.

658
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:18,280
什么毛病？
What kind of car trouble?

659
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:22,400
是水箱有问题，对不对？
I believe it was the radiator. Wasn't it, Cole?

660
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:25,620
对，该是这样
Yes, Rowdy, I believe it was.

661
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:36,840
添，你认识医院的职员吗？
Tim, do you know anybody at Daytona Memorial?

662
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:39,670
认识院长，为什么？ 他是不是赛车迷？
- The chief of staff. Why? - Is he a race fan?

663
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:41,010
对不起
He was born in the South.

664
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:43,130
添想你和韦鲁斯见见面
Tim wanted you to meet Russ Wheeler.

665
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:46,430
他会暂时代替你为车队出赛
He's gonna be driving for us till you get your medical clearance.

666
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:48,810
我感到很荣幸，狄先生
It's a real pleasure to race your car, Mr. Trickle.

667
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:50,470
谢谢你来帮忙
Yeah, thanks for helping out.

668
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:55,440
添…  我想知道一位医生的住址
Yeah, Tim, I need a home address of a doctor...

669
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,380
我的驾驶技术
I'm only sorry I won't be able to drive it

670
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,730
比不上你
nearly as good as you though.

671
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,780
哈利，待会见
I'll see you later, Harry.

672
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:07,160
医院那位医生…
Yeah, the doctor that...

673
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,540
那位…
That...

674
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,620
什么？
What?

675
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:34,940
我很想吸引你注意
I was desperate to get your attention.

676
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:39,610
你成功了，我的家变成森林
Well, you got it. I walked into a jungle.

677
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:46,860
很美丽…但我不能来  我是医生，我得随时应诊
No, it's nicely extravagant, but really, I can't. I'm a doctor on call.

678
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:51,080
我是病人  我和洛甸要检受检查
And I'm a patient. Somebody has to re-examine me. I need clearance.

679
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:53,040
来检查我们，我带你看赛车
Come up here and do that. I'll take you to a race.

680
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,210
我不想浪费假期
Come on, I don't want to watch you guys going round and round in circles,

681
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:59,170
看你们打圈追逐
chasing each other like a pack of dogs on my day off.

682
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:01,960
那你放假来追逐我吧
Then how about chasing me on your day off?

683
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:05,470
我没有假期，我要24小时应诊
I don't have a day off. I'm on call 24 hours.

684
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:09,340
医生，假设你有两天假期…
Okay, Doctor, let's suppose you had a couple of days off...

685
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:11,300
糖…
Sugar. Sugar.

686
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:13,350
又没有什么节目
...with nothing else to do.

687
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:17,310
你想不想来北卡罗来纳？
Could I interest you in the North Carolina countryside?

688
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:20,980
这是假设？ 只是假设
- Speaking theoretically? - Speaking theoretically.

689
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:24,320
可能吧，你得说服我上司
Maybe. But you'd have to convince my boss.

690
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,320
好…你有多高？
Good. Good. How tall are you?

691
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:45,960
他说什么？
What did he say?

692
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:49,430
医生，到沙洛特-加龙省  检查那两个小子
"Doctor, fly to Charlotte and check those boys out."

693
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:56,020
我的天  你迫不及待
Boy, you're very quick.

694
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,690
你应该看看我赛车
You ought to see me drive.

695
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:05,210
洛甸不在这里
Rowdy's not here.

696
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,700
我叫他五时来找我们
Well, I told him to meet us at the infield by 5:00.

697
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:12,200
我先替高检查吧
Well, we should probably get started on Cole.

698
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:19,460
闭上眼睛  手掌向上
Close your eyes. Palms up.

699
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:24,960
张开眼睛  垂下双手
Open your eyes. Arms down.

700
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:28,010
看着我的手指
Follow my finger.

701
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:46,980
站立，双脚靠拢，闭上眼睛
Stand with your feet together and close your eyes.

702
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:54,780
踏前一步  张开眼睛
Walk one foot in front of the other. Open your eyes.

703
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:58,290
回桌子
And back on the table.

704
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:07,630
真难受
This is tough.

705
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:10,760
-检查总是难受的  -为什么？
- Examinations always are. - Why's that?

706
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:15,300
因为我可能会发现坏现象
Because I'm looking you over and I might not like what I see.

707
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:19,310
你会担心  凝视墙壁
That has to worry you. Pick a spot on the wall and look at it.

708
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:27,110
-别动  -我没有动
- Please, don't move. Your eyes. - I didn't move.

709
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:29,110
眼睛固定注视一个地方
Just focus on one spot.

710
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:42,790
你在看什么？ 视网膜
- What do you see? - The retina.

711
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:46,210
它怎样？
What does it look like?

712
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:51,510
很美丽
Very pretty, actually.

713
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:01,220
看够了吗？ 差不多了
- Seen enough? - Just about.

714
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:08,570
为什么那样做？ 测试你的反应
- What did you do that for? - It's the Babinski sign.

715
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:12,320
脚趾向上翘便有问题
If the toe goes up, you're in trouble.

716
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,030
你没事  穿上衣服，你可以参赛了
You're fine. Put on your clothes. You're cleared to race.

717
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:36,970
对不起，我无法控制自己
I'm sorry, it just drove me nuts in there.

718
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:43,310
你怎可以这么冷漠  我不是冷漠
- How could you ignore me like that? - I wasn't ignoring you!

719
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:54,320
我不是冷漠，我给你彻底检查
I wasn't ignoring you. I gave you a very thorough physical.

720
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:05,370
你不是有什么怪念头吧
You're not gonna do anything weird on my leg, are you, Cole?

721
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:06,470
不是
No.

722
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:10,380
我和哈利常常这样做
It's just something Harry and I work on together.

723
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:12,670
这叫做透气方法
It's called drafting.

724
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:19,220
两部车贴着行驶  会比一部车跑得快
One car tucks in behind another. Two cars can go faster than one.

725
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:22,060
它们能分担空气阻力
They divide the air resistance between them.

726
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:24,350
最有趣的地方是…
Now, here's where it gets interesting.

727
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:28,140
前面的车要踩尽油门  才能保持速度
The lead car has to floor it to hit 200 miles an hour.

728
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:30,770
后面的车不必耗用太多燃料
But the car that's stuck behind doesn't.

729
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:34,360
它一样会跑得很快  还能保持后劲
He can go just as fast and still have power in reserve.

730
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:38,610
到了最后一个弯口
So, when these two cars come off that last turn,

731
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:42,120
后面的车跑出来
the car that's in back can move out of the draft,

732
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:45,950
超越它的拍？，后来居上
and slingshot past the lead car, beat it to the finish line.

733
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:52,250
直闯凯旋大道
And he goes straight to Victory Lane.

734
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,880
你和哈利研究这战术？ 是
- You and Harry work on that, huh? - More or less.

735
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:05,220
是吗  除了赛车，你还想做什么？
Yeah, right. Is there anything you want to do besides racing?

736
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,190
我听从你的吩咐
Anything you say.

737
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:15,070
你一定还有其他
Cole, there must be something else

738
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:18,780
人生目标  迟早总会有
that you want to do in life, eventually.

739
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:27,450
让我告诉你我最不想做的事  我讨厌作弊
I can tell you what I don't want to be in life, that's a fraud.

740
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:33,500
我想证明我不是凭运气赛车
I want to know it's not just dumb luck that gets me around that racetrack.

741
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:38,510
但你不是想问这个
But that's not the question you're really asking.

742
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:40,880
我想问什么？
What's the question I'm really asking?

743
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:44,930
我怎么会跟这男人上床？ -我知道答案
- "How can I be in bed with this guy?" - I know the answer to that one.

744
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:47,810
-但你仍然怀疑
Maybe, but you're still asking it.

745
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:50,810
我这个脑科医生
"How could I, a brilliant brain doctor,

746
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:54,270
怎么会跟车手上床？
"be in bed with a guy who drives a car for a living?"

747
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:59,860
你有什么回应？ 转身
What's your response to that, by the way?

748
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:06,700
证明你的实力，令我尊敬你  来吧
Do something to make me respect you. Do it.

749
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:09,660
告诉我为何爱上赛车
Tell me what you love so much about racing.

750
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:12,670
追求速度
The speed.

751
01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:16,840
控制速度
To be able to control it.

752
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:21,260
我能够控制不受控制的局面
To know that I can control something that's out of control.

753
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,800
要证明给你看？
I'd really have to show you.

754
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:30,560
证明给我看
Show me.

755
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:57,130
小时候我不想留在这里耕田
It's funny about this place. When I grew up, I hated farming.

756
01:01:57,210 --> 01:02:01,710
我只想当赛车手  现在当了车手
All I wanted to do was work on racecars. Got into racing.

757
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:05,090
我只想存钱开农场
Now all I want to do is to make enough money to work on a farm.

758
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:07,010
嘉莉，我是珍妮，幸会
Hi, Claire, I'm Jennie. Nice to meet you.

759
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:08,350
幸会
Hi, nice to meet you.

760
01:02:08,430 --> 01:02:10,010
-高，你好  -珍妮
- Hi, Cole. - Hey, Jennie.

761
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:17,810
我们打算在那山丘背后
Just beyond the top of that knoll,

762
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,770
盖一所房子
we're going to build our permanent home.

763
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:22,690
那要花多少钱？ -大约一千万元
- Costs much to build up there? - About $10 million.

764
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:23,780
-洛甸
Oh, Rowdy.

765
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:27,820
珍妮负责盖房子  她担任设计
Jennie's gonna do the building. She's designing the house.

766
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:30,700
我们想要没有人住过的新房子
We just want a place that nobody's ever lived in but us.

767
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:32,790
对吗？
Isn't that right, honey?

768
01:02:34,790 --> 01:02:37,880
-你怎么了？ -晕船
- Rowdy, what is it? - I think I'm getting seasick.

769
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:40,370
但你从来都不会晕船
Seasick? You've never been seasick a day in your life.

770
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:47,970
你不想接受检查？
You didn't forget about the physical, did you?

771
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:52,350
我家族的人临死前才会看医生
Nobody in my family goes to a doctor unless they're dying.

772
01:02:53,390 --> 01:02:55,890
病了不算是一回事
Just 'cause you ain't feeling good, shit.

773
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:58,230
站立，双脚靠拢
Stand with your feet together.

774
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,030
伸出双手
Put your arms out.

775
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:06,400
闭上眼睛
Close your eyes.

776
01:03:12,910 --> 01:03:16,290
小心  放松
Take it easy. Take it easy.

777
01:03:16,370 --> 01:03:18,880
我扶着你
- I'm fine. I'm fine. - Yeah, I've got you.

778
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,590
我没事
- I'm fine. I'm fine. - All right.

779
01:03:29,590 --> 01:03:32,140
你要回医院
We've got to get you back to Daytona.

780
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:35,430
我上司是全球最知名的  脑科医生
Bill Wilhaire, the head of neurosurgery, is my boss.

781
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:37,600
他是最棒的
He's as good as they come.

782
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:45,230
你在厕所呕吐？ 没有
- Did you get sick in there? - No.

783
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:47,570
-他呕吐  -洛甸
- He did, he got sick. - Rowdy.

784
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:52,740
没胆鬼，看到我晕你吓得想吐
You're one hell of a candy-ass. I faint and you throw up.

785
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:55,370
洛甸，你必须回医院
Rowdy, it's imperative that you get back to Daytona Memorial

786
01:03:55,370 --> 01:03:57,210
见韦医生
and see Dr. Wilhaire.

787
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:15,550
一支新车队参加温斯顿杯赛
The report on the birth of another new Winston Cup team.

788
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,970
我背后有一部橙蓝色
Behind me, the bright orange and blue colors of Hardee's

789
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:21,020
的雪佛莱  谁是车主？当然是韦鲁斯
adorn this Chevrolet. Who's the driver? Well, to no one's surprise,

790
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:23,400
他曾替代狄高出赛
it's Russ Wheeler, the young man who subbed so superbly

791
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,350
技术过人
just weeks ago for the injured Cole Trickle.

792
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:26,540
胡说八道
Listen to this horseshit.

793
01:04:26,610 --> 01:04:30,530
在我身旁的是车主杜添
Now joined by car owner, Tim Daland. Now, Tim, my question now is,

794
01:04:30,610 --> 01:04:32,570
你旗下有两名好手
you've got two competitive spirits here,

795
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:35,160
会否构成冲突？
and will these competitive spirits cause you a conflict?

796
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,700
两支车队会保持独立
Well, of course, Jerry, we believe that we can

797
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:40,960
各自为政
maintain the integrity and the independence of these two race teams,

798
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:42,580
否则我们不会组织两支车队
otherwise, we wouldn't be doing it.

799
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:45,550
添，你会捧哪位车手？
Who will you be rooting for come Sunday, Tim?

800
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:49,670
每次越过狄高我会向他挥手
Well, I tell you, Jerry, I'll even wave to him every time I lap him.

801
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,970
(乔治亚州，亚特兰大)

802
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:58,680
你应该安装支架
These new tires are terrible. You should have put on scuffs.

803
01:04:58,770 --> 01:04:59,870
你开得很好
You're doing good, Cole.

804
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,140
有点不稳定
I'm too loose.

805
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:09,490
这部车有问题
The car just feels all wrong.

806
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,320
什么事？ 高心情不好
- What's wrong? - Cole's upset.

807
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:16,240
为什么？ 他不想赛车
- What about? - About being in that racecar.

808
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:26,710
韦鲁斯越过八号车  他从内线爬你头
Wheeler just passed the eighth car. He's coming up on your inside.

809
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:36,950
我的天
Jesus!

810
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,630
发生什么事？ -引擎烧着了
- What happened? - The engine blew.

811
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:14,180
-为什么？ 我不是修车的
- How? - I'm not a mechanic, Harry.

812
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:33,360
嘉莉，我在乔治亚  洛甸在北卡罗来纳
Claire, I'm in Georgia today. Rowdy's in North Carolina.

813
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:35,780
得找人劝他来医院
Well, somebody better talk him into coming down here.

814
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:38,530
嘉莉  急症室有病人等你
Claire, we've got a trauma in the ER.

815
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:40,530
他脑出血  延迟就医
He's almost certainly hemorrhaging. The longer he ignores it,

816
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:42,870
只会令病情恶化
the more damage is gonna be done to his brain.

817
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:44,830
他是你的朋友
He's your friend, Cole.

818
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:48,000
-高在哪里？ -他讲电话
- Where's Cole? - He's on the phone.

819
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:52,460
给他一点私人时间
He could use a little privacy.

820
01:06:58,090 --> 01:06:59,190
-他怎么了？
What's wrong with him?

821
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:01,550
-是你害了他
I'll tell you what's wrong in this deal, it's you, Tim.

822
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,890
你自食其果
You're a victim of your own goddamn creation.

823
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:07,520
两支车队…一山不能藏二虎
Two race teams! That's one too many roosters in the hen house.

824
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,150
韦鲁斯倒没有埋怨
It doesn't seem to bother Russ Wheeler.

825
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:11,400
那场车祸发生后
Oh, no, no, no. Ever since that Daytona crash,

826
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:13,110
狄高被视为滋事者
Cole's been called a troublemaker.

827
01:07:13,190 --> 01:07:16,360
于是韦鲁斯肆意碰撞狄高
Wheeler figures he can bump and bam Cole all he wants.

828
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:18,320
我没有看到他撞狄高
I don't see Russ doing anything like that,

829
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:20,450
赛车会也没有发现他撞狄高
NASCAR doesn't see Russ doing anything like that.

830
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:22,160
你和赛车会的专家
I guess it ain't happening then,

831
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:25,660
都看不出来吧
under the watchful eyes of experts like you and NASCAR.

832
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,960
实情是这样
I tell you what is happening.

833
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:31,750
高跑得不好，他状态太差
Cole's not running good, he's not looking good,

834
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,420
赞助商不满意他的表现
and now he's got sponsor trouble.

835
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:36,170
-他们没有怪责你  -没有
- But you don't, is that it? - As far as that goes, no, I don't.

836
01:07:36,170 --> 01:07:38,630
但我想留着赞助商和狄高
But I want to keep the sponsor and Cole.

837
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,340
他为我们打江山
He's the one that really made this happen for us

838
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:41,890
我没有忘本
and I haven't forgotten that, Harry.

839
01:07:41,890 --> 01:07:43,640
是吗
Right. Right.

840
01:07:49,310 --> 01:07:52,440
跟医生通电话？ 你们吵嘴？
You on the phone with the doc? Fighting?

841
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:56,320
不，她没时间谈话
She's too busy to talk right now.

842
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:58,770
杜添
Here's your owner, Tim Daland.

843
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:00,700
你怎样看这位年轻车手
What do you think about this young man, Tim?

844
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:04,910
鲁斯表现得很出色，我很满意
I think Russ ran a great race today. I'm really, really very pleased.

845
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:07,370
完成了102圈
One hundred and two laps complete,

846
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:09,670
车手暂时不准爬头
but we're under caution here at North Wilkesboro.

847
01:08:10,290 --> 01:08:12,460
为什么高不探望洛甸？
How come Cole hasn't seen Rowdy yet?

848
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:14,960
高和所有车手一样
Cole's no different from any other driver.

849
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:16,710
什么意思？
What do you mean he's no different?

850
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:20,760
高当然不想见洛甸
Well, I mean, of course Cole doesn't want to see Rowdy.

851
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:24,050
车手不想忆起跑道上的意外
Drivers can't stand to be reminded of what can happen to them in a racecar.

852
01:08:24,050 --> 01:08:26,810
他们不去医院，也不去葬礼
They don't go to hospitals, they don't go to funerals.

853
01:08:26,890 --> 01:08:30,100
说服车手参加别人的葬礼…
You get a driver to a funeral before he's actually dead,

854
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:32,060
是一件比登天还难的事  进来
you made history, Doc.

855
01:08:55,710 --> 01:08:58,380
他挡着我  好极了
- He's blocking me. - That's right.

856
01:09:01,010 --> 01:09:03,050
添  走吧
Move the son of a bitch!

857
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,150
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch!

858
01:09:59,230 --> 01:10:03,740
狄高右边两个车胎都爆了
Trickle moving to the bottom of the track with both right-side tires flat.

859
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:08,660
韦鲁斯第一位冲线
Russ Wheeler takes the checkered flag...

860
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:16,500
韦鲁斯胜之不武
Russ Wheeler don't deserve to win, Tim.

861
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:20,000
赛车会和你都应该出来谴责他
If NASCAR won't call it lowdown, shit-assed racing, you better.

862
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:21,500
-赛车就是这样  -是吗
- It's just racing, Harry. - Oh, yeah?

863
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:23,340
-狄高太小器了  -是吗
- Cole overreacted. Yeah. - Oh, yeah?

864
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,270
换车胎
Change my tires.

865
01:10:32,350 --> 01:10:34,310
为什么？赛事完了
I don't know what for, Cole. It's over.

866
01:10:34,390 --> 01:10:36,270
换车胎
Change my tires.

867
01:11:09,050 --> 01:11:13,390
维修站外面有事发生
There seems to be a little post-race activity just outside the pit lane.

868
01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:14,770
可恶
You shit!

869
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:22,690
他毁了我两部车  两部车都被他毁了
He's destroyed both my cars. He's destroyed both my cars!

870
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:26,070
我炒他鱿鱼，炒你鱿鱼
He's fired! You're fired!

871
01:11:26,150 --> 01:11:28,160
你们全都被炒鱿鱼，听到吗？ 你们全都要被炒鱿鱼
You're all fired. You hear me?

872
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:34,600
(希尔顿)

873
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:45,710
你拿行李，然后回医院？
Are you going to get your bags, head off to Daytona?

874
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:48,380
你去哪里？
Where are you going from here?

875
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:52,100
送你到机场，交还这部车
I'll take you to the airport, drop off the rental car,

876
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:54,260
然后坐飞机回沙洛特-加龙省
catch a flight to Charlotte.

877
01:11:56,770 --> 01:11:59,060
要我陪你回去吗？
You want me to come with you?

878
01:12:01,190 --> 01:12:04,070
你不用回医院？
You don't have to go back to the hospital?

879
01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:08,320
我们可以去探望洛甸  是
- We could also try to see Rowdy. - Yeah.

880
01:12:11,030 --> 01:12:14,990
有什么问题吗？ 没问题
- Is there anything wrong with that? - Of course not.

881
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:20,000
我只是忘记了  我知道
- I guess I just forgot about that. - Yeah, I know.

882
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:26,510
高
Cole!

883
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:35,830
我要下车
Let me out of the car, Cole.

884
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,870
我要下车…
Let me out of the car, Cole. Let me out of the car.

885
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:49,950
我要下车  你不停车我也要下车
Let me out of the car! Let me out or I'm getting out.

886
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:52,360
嘿…
Hey! Hey, hey!

887
01:12:53,990 --> 01:12:57,540
嘉莉  别走
Claire! Wait. Just wait.

888
01:12:57,620 --> 01:12:59,370
别跟着来，我会报警
- Get away or I'll call the police. - You'll what?

889
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:01,620
-什么？ -你听到的  报警吧
- You heard me. - Okay, call the police.

890
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:02,870
我会跟着你等你说话
But I'm not leaving until you talk.

891
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,540
-我无话可说  -我有话要说
- I've got nothing to say. - Well, I do!

892
01:13:04,540 --> 01:13:06,800
好，说吧
Okay, great. Let's hear it.

893
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:12,430
就是这样？好
- That's it? Fine. - Just...

894
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:15,680
-来吧  -你不应该开车  不要再去马路、跑道
You shouldn't be driving a car anyway. Not on a road, not on a racetrack,

895
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:16,850
以及停车场
and not in a parking lot.

896
01:13:16,930 --> 01:13:20,310
你自私、疯狂，你害怕
You're selfish, you're crazy and you're scared.

897
01:13:20,390 --> 01:13:22,600
我没有害怕  你怕得要死
- I'm not scared. - You are scared to death.

898
01:13:22,690 --> 01:13:25,230
你和洛甸一样
You and Rowdy, you have the same sickness. It's called denial.

899
01:13:25,230 --> 01:13:28,070
不肯面对现实迟早会没命
And it's probably going to kill you both.

900
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:34,570
你说你想控制
You want to control something that's out of control,

901
01:13:34,570 --> 01:13:36,870
无法控制的局面
that's what you said to me, wasn't it?

902
01:13:36,950 --> 01:13:38,330
让我告诉你
I'm going to let you in on a little secret

903
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:41,250
所有人都知道…
that almost everybody else in this world automatically knows.

904
01:13:41,330 --> 01:13:44,000
我们不能控制
Control is an illusion, you infantile egomaniac.

905
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,540
也无法预知未来
Nobody knows what's gonna happen next.

906
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:49,630
车、飞机、我们的身体  随时会出事
Not on a freeway, not in an airplane, not inside our own bodies,

907
01:13:49,710 --> 01:13:53,760
四十个自大狂一起飚车  自然更危险
and certainly not on a racetrack with 40 other infantile egomaniacs.

908
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:55,930
没有人能控制任何事
Nobody knows and nobody controls anything.

909
01:13:56,010 --> 01:13:58,560
你意识到这道理，于是你害怕
Now, you've gotten a glimpse of that and you're scared.

910
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:00,220
你失去勇气
You might not have the courage to race anymore.

911
01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:02,270
你再不能赛车
You may never have had it.

912
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:08,060
你真讨厌
God, I hate you for this, you son of a bitch.

913
01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:10,440
你逼我板起面孔说教
You make me sound like a doctor.

914
01:15:05,210 --> 01:15:06,540
珍妮
Jennie.

915
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,170
你为什么来了？
Why are you here?

916
01:15:12,710 --> 01:15:14,130
他在哪里？
Where is he?

917
01:15:26,770 --> 01:15:29,230
-听说你失业了  -对
- I hear you're out of a job. - Yeah.

918
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:37,030
你脸色很差
You're not looking too good.

919
01:15:39,110 --> 01:15:41,660
一天吃多少颗止痛药？
How many of these things do you chew every day?

920
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:43,870
你来做什么？
What did you come here for?

921
01:15:46,830 --> 01:15:49,000
抓你去医院
To take you to the hospital.

922
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:54,340
若不是那个女医生
If it had been anybody but a damn woman doctor,

923
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:57,340
我早已回去赛车
I'd have been back on the track weeks ago.

924
01:15:57,420 --> 01:16:00,180
是吗？ 是
- Is that right? - Yeah, that's right.

925
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:04,060
听着  断腿、心脏受伤
Listen, man, I've raced with my legs broke, heart bruised,

926
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:07,390
眼球快掉出来
eyes popping out of my head like they're on springs.

927
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:11,230
我还不是照样参赛
This is going to go away just like anything else.

928
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:13,440
这次也不会例外  我不会死
As far as I'm concerned, I'm going to live forever,

929
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:15,860
去了医院才会死
unless I go to some damn hospital where they

930
01:16:15,940 --> 01:16:20,450
他们逼你脱鞋、闭上眼睛  然后你就死了
take your shoes off, and make you shut your eyes, and bang, you're dead.

931
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:23,660
这是什么奖杯？
What did you win this for?

932
01:16:24,490 --> 01:16:27,580
这个…是那场赛事的？
This one right here. What did you win this for?

933
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:30,920
上面没写着吗？
Doesn't it say?

934
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:32,500
温斯顿杯
Yeah, it's the Winston Cup, buddy.

935
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:35,380
容易被人遗忘
Well, hell, that's an easy one to forget.

936
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:38,880
你的名字呢？你也忘了？
What's your name? Or has that slipped your mind, too?

937
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:44,890
去你的
- Screw you, man. - Okay.

938
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:48,770
去医院治好你的脑袋  或者留在这里敲脑袋
We can go down there and fix your head or we can fix it right here!

939
01:16:48,890 --> 01:16:50,850
你选哪一样？
Now, what's it gonna be?

940
01:16:56,730 --> 01:16:58,900
洛甸想见你
Rowdy would like to see you.

941
01:17:05,330 --> 01:17:07,450
-他怎样？ -他还好
- How is he? - He's okay.

942
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:10,790
-你好吗？ -很好
- How are you? - Good.

943
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:14,960
他能否参加地通拿赛？
Think he'll make Daytona? It's not for a few months.

944
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,630
他会康复
I think he'll make it out of the hospital.

945
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:20,010
但他再不能赛车
But he'll never drive a racecar again.

946
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:30,930
这是韦医生，他替洛甸施手术
Cole, this is Dr. Wilhaire. He's going to be doing the surgery.

947
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:32,890
-我是狄高  -狄高
- Cole Trickle. - Cole.

948
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:35,400
他怎样？
So, how is he?

949
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:39,860
医生说我的脑部要动小手术
Well, the doc here says I need minor brain surgery.

950
01:17:39,940 --> 01:17:41,670
也不算是小手术
Well, that's not exactly how I put it.

951
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:45,700
他脑袋太小，只能动小手术
Well, listen, Doc, any surgery on his brain is bound to be minor.

952
01:17:47,530 --> 01:17:49,830
我想跟他单独谈谈
You all mind if I talk to this guy a second?

953
01:17:49,910 --> 01:17:51,290
好
Of course.

954
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:06,010
脑部有一条血管爆裂了
They say I got a busted blood vessel in my brain.

955
01:18:06,090 --> 01:18:10,600
他们想在我的头开洞取瘀血
So, they want to drill a hole in my head and get rid of the leaky blood.

956
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:14,940
我应该接受手术吗？
You think I should let them do it, Cole?

957
01:18:15,940 --> 01:18:17,230
应该
Yeah.

958
01:18:17,310 --> 01:18:20,980
换了是你，你会动手术？ 我会
- You'd let them if it was you? - I would.

959
01:18:21,690 --> 01:18:25,200
好，我想请你帮我做一件事
Okay, then I've got to ask you to do something for me.

960
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:27,740
说吧
Well, name it.

961
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:31,700
驾驶我的车  你说什么？
- Drive my car. - What are you talking about?

962
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:33,040
地通拿大赛
Daytona.

963
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:38,250
你有足够时间准备出赛
No, Rowdy, you have plenty of time to get ready for Daytona.

964
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:39,960
不必找我
You don't need me.

965
01:18:42,010 --> 01:18:45,800
我失去了赞助商  他们没有赞助我的跑车
I lost my sponsor. They put their money on me, not the car.

966
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:49,600
我不知道手术会否成功
Now, they ain't too sure I'm going to come out of this deal.

967
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:51,350
你说呢？
Are you?

968
01:18:54,890 --> 01:18:58,770
我买了地，还没付钱
I've got a lot of land and a lot of plans I ain't paid for.

969
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:02,440
我的车要胜出
So the only way to get my sponsor back is to make sure

970
01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:04,070
才会有赞助商找我
my car runs good at Daytona.

971
01:19:04,150 --> 01:19:06,660
电视台会注意我的车
All that network TV shit, you know.

972
01:19:07,950 --> 01:19:09,050
不必找我
Well, you don't need me.

973
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,950
这里还有其他车手
There's plenty of other drivers. You don't need me.

974
01:19:10,950 --> 01:19:14,450
别来这一套，混蛋
Don't give me that mealy-mouthed shit, you son of a bitch.

975
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:17,250
我要找一个能登上五甲的车手
I got to put a driver in my car that'll finish in the top five,

976
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:20,670
否则赞助商不会为我付账
before my sponsors will pick up the tab for the year.

977
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:25,380
地通拿大赛后我可能会复出
Maybe after Daytona, maybe I can drive.

978
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,180
也可能无法复出
Maybe it'll be a different driver.

979
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:31,300
现在我要想办法养家
But in the meantime, I want the best for my family.

980
01:19:31,390 --> 01:19:34,060
别推搪我
So don't you bullshit me, Cole.

981
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:38,560
你有什么理由不替我出赛？
Is there some other reason why I ain't good enough for you to drive for?

982
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:50,820
你答应我了？
Then you'll do it?

983
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:08,090
还以为你不肯帮我
Shit, man. You had me going.

984
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:14,060
现在谈细节吧  你和杜添签了什么合约？
Now, let's get down to business here. What's your deal with Daland?

985
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:20,730
我们改天再谈吧  失陪一会
Hell, we'll work that out, okay? Excuse me for a second.

986
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:29,360
高，什么事？ 告诉洛甸我会给他电话
- Cole, what's wrong? - Just tell Rowdy I'll call him.

987
01:20:47,090 --> 01:20:49,510
不行…
No, no, no, no, sir!

988
01:20:49,630 --> 01:20:52,890
不能合作，不想合作  代价太大
Can't use them. Don't want them. Couldn't afford them if I did.

989
01:20:52,970 --> 01:20:54,640
你说什么？
What the hell are you talking about?

990
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:58,390
我说赛车手  我知道你和班洛甸的事
Racecar drivers. I know all about you and Rowdy Burns.

991
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:02,560
我不会为你们修车参赛
And I ain't setting up that car for Daytona or anywhere else, Cole,

992
01:21:02,650 --> 01:21:04,440
但你可以进来
but you're welcome to come on in.

993
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:06,650
我们喝酒、瞎扯
We'll bring out the moonshine and start telling lies

994
01:21:06,650 --> 01:21:08,030
同时找美人
and calling up the women.

995
01:21:08,110 --> 01:21:12,200
赛车免谈，进来  好，不谈赛车
- But no talk about racing. Come on. - All right, no talk about racing.

996
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:13,740
贝克，来
Come on, Buck,

997
01:21:14,450 --> 01:21:16,240
我跟你们赛跑
I'll race your ass.

998
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:32,470
我要走了，晚安
I believe I'm gonna take off. Good night, Harry.

999
01:21:46,150 --> 01:21:48,400
为什么不帮我？
Why won't you set up the car?

1000
01:21:53,490 --> 01:21:56,580
自从那次意外中洛甸受伤后
Ever since you and Rowdy crashed at Daytona and Rowdy got sick,

1001
01:21:56,660 --> 01:21:58,530
你担心自己
you've been waiting for the other shoe to drop,

1002
01:21:58,540 --> 01:22:01,370
也会遇上不幸
waiting on something bad to happen to you.

1003
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:05,080
他们说白毕地经常听到怪声
Just like Buddy Bretherton. He started hearing voices.

1004
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:08,710
在哪个赛车场都听到
All kinds of them, everywhere. Atlanta, Richmond, Wilkesboro.

1005
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:11,670
他听到一个讯息
And all of them only had but one thing to say,

1006
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:15,930
离开跑车，下车…
"Get out of that racecar. Get out..."

1007
01:22:21,810 --> 01:22:23,270
在亚特兰大
You pegged the engine in Atlanta,

1008
01:22:23,270 --> 01:22:25,770
你把引擎烧坏
redlined the son of a bitch and blew it sky-high.

1009
01:22:25,850 --> 01:22:28,690
你是故意的
Done it deliberate. Done it deliberate.

1010
01:22:30,150 --> 01:22:34,820
转数标指着9400转
9,400 rpms according to the little telltale button.

1011
01:22:37,370 --> 01:22:41,200
你不想赛车，你不想死
You was worried if you didn't get out of that car right quick, you'd die.

1012
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:43,080
我有没有说错了
Now call me a liar.

1013
01:22:44,620 --> 01:22:46,370
你没说错
You're not lying.

1014
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:50,170
现在你还要谈什么？
All right. What the hell are we talking about then?

1015
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:54,090
我想开洛甸的车参赛  你要帮我
Racing Rowdy's car at Daytona. I can't do it without you.

1016
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,760
你是干不来的
You can't do it period.

1017
01:22:59,010 --> 01:23:01,560
我不会重返赛车场
And I ain't going back there, Cole.

1018
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:16,200
白毕地不是死于心脏病  对吗？ 什么？
Buddy didn't really die of a heart attack, did he?

1019
01:23:16,990 --> 01:23:20,530
白毕地不是死于心脏病吧
Buddy didn't really die of a heart attack, did he?

1020
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:23,910
真相你还是不知道的好
No, he didn't, but you don't wanna hear about it.

1021
01:23:27,290 --> 01:23:31,460
赛车会相信  是跑车的装置害死了他
NASCAR privately claimed the setup on the car is what killed Buddy.

1022
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:37,590
你用薄气喉来减轻车身重量
You used thin-walled tubing to keep the weight down.

1023
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:39,890
气喉爆裂
The exhaust fumes broke through the fire wall

1024
01:23:39,970 --> 01:23:42,350
毕地吸入一氧化碳
and carbon monoxide knocked Buddy out.

1025
01:23:42,470 --> 01:23:45,100
废话  撞墙的时候
Horseshit! When Buddy hit the wall at the third turn,

1026
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:48,190
他还是嚷个不停
he was jabbering on the radio about as fast as he was driving.

1027
01:23:48,270 --> 01:23:50,690
什么一氧化碳
Carbon monoxide, my ass.

1028
01:23:50,770 --> 01:23:52,650
昏迷的人
That was the loudest-talking unconscious man

1029
01:23:52,650 --> 01:23:53,920
怎会说话
you ever heard in your life.

1030
01:23:53,940 --> 01:23:56,990
毕地胡思乱想，结果送命
Nothing killed Buddy but his imagination.

1031
01:23:57,070 --> 01:24:00,570
为什么不让他们调查死因  为什么？
Why didn't you let them investigate, Harry? Why? Why?

1032
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:03,200
因为我早应该
'Cause I should have known better

1033
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:06,120
阻止他参赛
than to let him drive in the first place.

1034
01:24:07,830 --> 01:24:09,790
白毕地
You see, Buddy...

1035
01:24:09,870 --> 01:24:12,840
最惹人讨厌
Buddy was a terrible pain in the ass. He really was.

1036
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:14,590
他自认对车有认识
He thought he knew about cars,

1037
01:24:14,670 --> 01:24:17,010
所以他比你更无知
which made him twice as ignorant as you.

1038
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:20,340
但是…
But still...

1039
01:24:26,890 --> 01:24:29,770
我看着他赛车
I look at guys like Buddy...

1040
01:24:29,850 --> 01:24:34,570
他可以把跑车发挥得淋漓尽致
I've seen him do things in my racecar that's absolutely unbelievable.

1041
01:24:34,650 --> 01:24:37,320
证明我没有枉费心机
That really showed me what I had done.

1042
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:39,380
你会不自觉地
And then you see,

1043
01:24:39,450 --> 01:24:42,490
爱上他这类人
you're gonna automatically have to sort of love that guy.

1044
01:24:42,570 --> 01:24:44,700
不论你喜不喜欢他
Whether you want to or not.

1045
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:48,410
白毕地
Buddy Bretherton.

1046
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:53,460
哈利，我想问你一件事
I have to ask you something, Harry.

1047
01:24:54,130 --> 01:24:59,300
在撞墙之前
Now, before Buddy hit the wall,

1048
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:02,180
毕地在赛道上表现如何？
how was he actually doing in that race?

1049
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:07,140
该死的
- You ornery, no good... - Hey, hey...

1050
01:25:07,220 --> 01:25:11,440
我那部车就看你的了
You set up that car. You set up the car.

1051
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:15,570
不要再赛车，你会死  你会死，听到吗？ 你会死
If you get back in that car, you'll die. You'll die. You hear?

1052
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:23,570
我不开我的车，我开洛甸的车
I'm not getting back in my car, I'm getting in Rowdy's.

1053
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:26,870
你真是蠢得可怜
Well, I see how you're dumb enough to be a race driver.

1054
01:25:26,950 --> 01:25:29,270
开他的车就可以避过厄运？
You think you'll hide from your bad luck in his car?

1055
01:25:29,330 --> 01:25:31,370
何必为洛甸冒险？
What the hell for? For Rowdy?

1056
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:34,710
为着拿奖杯，他会开车撞你
If he could run tomorrow, he'd crash you to win the race!

1057
01:25:34,790 --> 01:25:35,890
他不是好人
He's mean.

1058
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:39,840
为什么帮他？ 因为他请我帮忙
- He's no particular friend, so why? - Because he asked me to.

1059
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:42,930
废话，你舍不得放弃赛车
Horseshit! You just wanna race again.

1060
01:25:43,010 --> 01:25:46,050
-是，你也一样  -是
Yeah. And so do you.

1061
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:48,140
但你心里害怕
Well, you're scared.

1062
01:25:48,220 --> 01:25:51,640
是，你也一样
- You're scared. - Yeah, and so are you.

1063
01:25:53,770 --> 01:25:54,900
是
Yeah.

1064
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:05,950
怎么了？
What?

1065
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:10,950
我需要参赛
I need this, Harry.

1066
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,170
除了赛车我一无所有
I don't have anything else.

1067
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:21,670
是你给我生命
You've given me a life.

1068
01:26:25,970 --> 01:26:28,640
我不想失去生命
God damn it, I don't want to lose it.

1069
01:26:29,970 --> 01:26:31,720
让我出赛
Just put me in that racecar.

1070
01:26:31,810 --> 01:26:34,890
让我证明你没有枉费心机
Let me be the one to show you what you've done.

1071
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:38,110
相信我
Just trust me.

1072
01:26:43,650 --> 01:26:48,200
让我开车，我不会令你失望
Let me drive, Harry. I won't make a fool out of you.

1073
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:06,050
我…  我不能预知后果
I honestly just wouldn't know how this deal's going to turn out, Cole.

1074
01:27:06,130 --> 01:27:07,430
你懂的
You know.

1075
01:27:09,350 --> 01:27:11,180
我也不能
Neither do I, Harry.

1076
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:37,410
清凉的气温适合你
I'm setting up for cool weather.

1077
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:39,670
要是烈日当头
But if that sun breaks after you're on the track,

1078
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:42,210
你会跑得不稳定
you're liable to run real loose real quick.

1079
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:45,090
我不想你担心，但高应付不来
I don't wanna worry you enough, but Cole's not ready for that.

1080
01:27:45,170 --> 01:27:47,970
他改变了
He's changed. See, he's changed.

1081
01:27:48,050 --> 01:27:52,140
如果你失去控制  他会不知所措
You cannot get out of control and expect him to bring you right back.

1082
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:55,520
他会伤害你，你会伤害他
He's liable to hurt you, you're liable to hurt him.

1083
01:27:56,390 --> 01:27:58,600
我也无能为力，所以…
I couldn't handle that. So...

1084
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:02,730
你要照顾他，行吗？
You've got to take care of him. All right?

1085
01:28:04,030 --> 01:28:06,320
你要照顾他
You've got to take care of him.

1086
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:21,000
这不是我想要的答案
This is not the kind of answer I'm looking for from you.

1087
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:29,680
地通拿赛道
Daytona is a tough racetrack.

1088
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:31,970
难度很高
And I'm sure, myself and everybody,

1089
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:34,310
我们会留意狄高
we're going to keep an eye on Cole to see

1090
01:28:34,390 --> 01:28:36,890
看看他能否应付紧急场面
if he's there, you know, all his reflexes and everything.

1091
01:28:36,890 --> 01:28:38,480
他驾驶技术高明
He's plenty capable of running that racecar good

1092
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:39,980
那次意外…
and I don't think he has any kind of

1093
01:28:39,980 --> 01:28:43,060
相信不会影响他的表现
effects from the accident that would be a factor in the way he performs.

1094
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:44,520
他回来真好
I'm glad he's well enough to come back

1095
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:46,570
希望能击败他
and I hope I beat him at the same time.

1096
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:47,780
很多人不喜欢他
You know, a lot of guys don't like him.

1097
01:28:47,860 --> 01:28:50,280
他很有天分
And it's just the situation where the guy's got a lot of talent.

1098
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:52,030
他只是一心想取胜
He's wide open, he doesn't think about anything else,

1099
01:28:52,030 --> 01:28:53,700
一心想取胜
he just wants to win. I like that.

1100
01:28:53,780 --> 01:28:57,950
车祸发生后，他对自己和其他车手都是个危险人物
Since the crash, he's been a danger to himself and to other drivers.

1101
01:28:58,870 --> 01:29:02,330
如果他接近我  我会把他逼向墙边
But if he comes near me, I'm going to put him in the wall.

1102
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:04,040
就是这么简单
Simple as that.

1103
01:29:04,460 --> 01:29:08,260
但我相信  我只会在倒后镜见到他
I don't expect I'll see too much of him. Except in my rearview mirror.

1104
01:29:31,570 --> 01:29:32,860
进来
Come in.

1105
01:29:38,410 --> 01:29:41,500
哈利说你不会介意我来看你
Harry said you wouldn't mind if I stopped by.

1106
01:29:49,670 --> 01:29:53,680
洛甸怎样？ 他日渐康复
- How's Rowdy? - He's getting better every day.

1107
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:56,180
因为你说
Especially since you told him how much

1108
01:29:56,180 --> 01:29:59,430
你很想为他出赛
you were looking forward to getting in his racecar.

1109
01:29:59,810 --> 01:30:01,600
我说谎
So I lied.

1110
01:30:04,310 --> 01:30:05,860
你在想什么？
What are you thinking?

1111
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:09,230
我想知道你在想什么
Just how much I'd like to know what you're thinking.

1112
01:30:12,110 --> 01:30:14,490
每个人都一样
I guess everybody's the same.

1113
01:30:14,570 --> 01:30:15,780
想活得开心
You've got to be good at your job

1114
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:18,660
就要把工作做好
before you can enjoy the rest of your life.

1115
01:30:18,740 --> 01:30:20,290
这是我的工作
This is my job.

1116
01:30:21,620 --> 01:30:23,290
我唯一的专长
It's all I know.

1117
01:30:31,550 --> 01:30:34,090
我不敢看你出赛
You know I can't watch you do this.

1118
01:30:35,010 --> 01:30:36,220
嘉莉
Claire.

1119
01:30:37,970 --> 01:30:43,680
我不怕受伤，我只怕一事无成
I'm more afraid of being nothing than I am of being hurt.

1120
01:30:47,060 --> 01:30:48,480
送我出去吧
Walk me out?

1121
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:57,570
欢迎莅临参观  地通拿500大赛
We welcome you to the Daytona 500, the Super Bowl of motor racing events.

1122
01:30:57,660 --> 01:30:59,700
今天的大热门是韦鲁斯
Certainly among the favorites for today's race

1123
01:30:59,780 --> 01:31:04,000
他驾驶十八号跑车
has to be Russ Wheeler driving the number 18 Hardee's sponsored car.

1124
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:06,410
车迷都相信他
He has certainly given race fans something to talk about

1125
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:09,540
今天能夺标
after winning the pole for today's event.

1126
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:11,500
狄高再战江湖
But don't count out Cole Trickle,

1127
01:31:11,590 --> 01:31:14,340
不容忽视
who is returning to Daytona for the first time

1128
01:31:14,420 --> 01:31:17,590
去年七月他在这赛道遇上意外
since his near-fatal accident here last July.

1129
01:31:20,180 --> 01:31:22,470
你说你们没有赞助商
Told me you guys didn't have a sponsor.

1130
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:26,560
他们给的钱只够用来贴商标
Well, they gave us just about enough money to put their name on the car.

1131
01:31:33,230 --> 01:31:35,190
添  高
- Tim. - Cole.

1132
01:31:46,580 --> 01:31:50,170
有什么问题？
Why is the hood up? What's wrong with the car?

1133
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:52,380
别担心，我们换引擎
Take it easy. We had to change engines.

1134
01:31:52,460 --> 01:31:55,380
忘了拉紧油管
We forgot to tighten the oil line.

1135
01:31:55,460 --> 01:31:59,050
为什么要换引擎？ 滤油器有金属碎片
- Why did you have to change engines? - Found some metal in the oil filter.

1136
01:32:01,010 --> 01:32:04,470
从哪里找来这引擎？ 偷来的
- Where did you get the engine? - Well, we stole it.

1137
01:32:10,230 --> 01:32:13,020
嘉莉，叫他上车
Claire, put the boy in his car,

1138
01:32:13,110 --> 01:32:16,740
他可能会作贼心虚不敢上车
tell him to get out on the track before he starts sweating, all right.

1139
01:32:34,170 --> 01:32:37,340
你会开车离开？
So, you're going to get in your car and take off?

1140
01:32:41,390 --> 01:32:43,050
小心驾驶
Drive carefully.

1141
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:16,300
各位选手，请开动引擎
Gentlemen, start your engines.

1142
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:36,360
地通拿500大赛开始了
We are underway. The Daytona 500 is on.

1143
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:49,870
200圈赛事，进入56圈  韦鲁斯领先
We are 56 laps into this 200-lap event and Russ Wheeler is in the lead.

1144
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:55,290
47.01秒，第一位跑45.90秒  你在最后位置
47:01. Lead is 45:90. You're running last.

1145
01:34:01,170 --> 01:34:03,050
高，你怎么了？
What's going on, Cole?

1146
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:08,430
你没事吧
Are you all right?

1147
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:18,730
刚跑完半程，韦依然领先
Just past the halfway mark and Wheeler still leads.

1148
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:35,420
三号弯角有意外
There's a crash at turn three, and some oil at the bottom of the track.

1149
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:37,420
跑道有油迹
The lead is just taken.

1150
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:42,970
其他车在滑行，你小心点
Cars are sliding down from the top of the track, so watch yourself.

1151
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:48,300
走外圈吧  找一条路冲过去
You'd better go high, Cole. Pick a line you can drive through.

1152
01:34:51,470 --> 01:34:55,770
高，你没事吧  请回答我
Cole, are you all right? Answer me, please.

1153
01:34:57,940 --> 01:35:01,110
绕过车堆，你做得到的
Go around those wrecks. You can drive through it.

1154
01:35:03,070 --> 01:35:05,450
我对你有信心
I know it. I know it in my heart.

1155
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:20,750
我冲出来了
I'm through it, Harry!

1156
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:25,010
我要撇下它们
I'm out of here.

1157
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:37,690
狄高升至第九位，后劲凌厉
Cole's moved up to ninth. He's coming on strong.

1158
01:35:38,650 --> 01:35:42,110
十八号车依然领先
Russ Wheeler in car number 18 continues to lead the way,

1159
01:35:42,190 --> 01:35:44,940
但狄高急起直追
but the man on the move is Cole Trickle.

1160
01:35:50,950 --> 01:35:53,290
我要突围而出
I'm gonna make a hole to get through here.

1161
01:36:00,170 --> 01:36:01,270
好了
Here we go.

1162
01:36:12,300 --> 01:36:15,640
韦逼我撞根斯，根斯失控了
Wheeler knocked me into Ganz. Ganz spun out.

1163
01:36:20,650 --> 01:36:22,020
他走外圈
He's going high.

1164
01:36:24,530 --> 01:36:25,730
可恶
God damn it!

1165
01:36:25,820 --> 01:36:29,070
狄高爬头领先
And on the high side of the track, Trickle takes the lead.

1166
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:30,450
高，加油
Go, Cole!

1167
01:36:34,830 --> 01:36:36,790
对，就是要这样
This is it, this is what it's all about.

1168
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:44,500
只剩下23圈，狄高领先
With just 23 laps to go, Cole Trickle is leading.

1169
01:36:44,590 --> 01:36:47,090
-别放过他  -我会教训他
- Take him now, Russ. - He's all mine.

1170
01:37:00,770 --> 01:37:04,980
哈利，油门卡着了  我踩尽了油门
The accelerator is stuck, Harry. It's stuck, it's on the floorboard.

1171
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:08,030
我没法减速
I can't slow down.

1172
01:37:09,070 --> 01:37:11,150
踩离合器，让引擎燃烧
Step on the clutch and let the son of a bitch blow it.

1173
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:12,530
这回玩完了
It's over, Cole.

1174
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:19,620
狗娘养的
Son of a...

1175
01:37:28,460 --> 01:37:29,560
高，你没事吧
Cole, you okay?

1176
01:37:29,630 --> 01:37:31,380
油门没事了
The good news is the accelerator is fixed,

1177
01:37:31,380 --> 01:37:33,510
但波箱有问题
the bad news is the transmission is screwed.

1178
01:37:33,590 --> 01:37:35,100
我回修理站
I'm coming in.

1179
01:37:49,490 --> 01:37:53,280
他们出局了？ 四十五秒后自会出局
- Are they out of the race, yet? - They will be in about 45 seconds.

1180
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:54,490
我要走在领航车前面
That's the pace car.

1181
01:37:54,570 --> 01:37:57,950
否则完了
Get me out in front of the pace car or the race is over for us!

1182
01:37:58,040 --> 01:38:01,000
低波有问题  给他高波齿轮
- The linkage is all twisted. - Just give him the high gear.

1183
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:02,710
让我走
Get me out there.

1184
01:38:03,790 --> 01:38:05,130
行了
I got it.

1185
01:38:05,540 --> 01:38:07,550
领航车来了
Pace car's on its way.

1186
01:38:07,630 --> 01:38:09,050
快点
Let's go.

1187
01:38:09,130 --> 01:38:12,050
快点…  快点…
- Come on, man, come on. - Go! Go! Go!

1188
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:16,180
你们去帮他，去吧
Get out there and help them! Go! Go! Go!

1189
01:38:26,190 --> 01:38:28,140
成功了，做得好
All right, all right, we made it. Good work.

1190
01:38:29,150 --> 01:38:30,780
-谢谢你  -别客气
I owe you one.

1191
01:38:32,950 --> 01:38:35,200
你不能这样做，那不是你的车
Hey, you can't do that. That's not your car.

1192
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:37,870
那引擎是我给他的
It's my engine in that car, I gave him that engine,

1193
01:38:37,950 --> 01:38:39,870
我的人可以推他的车
and that's what my boys are pushing.

1194
01:38:42,290 --> 01:38:45,920
等绿旗出现，然后全速前进
Cole, you better be at max speed when the green flag drops.

1195
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:51,960
领航车离开
The pace car pulls off the track.

1196
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:54,340
大会出示绿旗
The green flag is out and racing resumes.

1197
01:38:54,430 --> 01:38:56,340
韦仍然领先  好
Wheeler broke away, he's still in the lead.

1198
01:39:02,390 --> 01:39:04,350
我在什么位置？
- Where am I? - Running ninth.

1199
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:06,560
八圈
- How many laps to go? - Eight.

1200
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:14,570
我和韦相距多少？
What's the interval between me and Wheeler?

1201
01:39:14,650 --> 01:39:17,450
鲁斯，狄高由第五位追上来
Trickle's fifth and moving up fast, Russ.

1202
01:39:27,370 --> 01:39:28,790
记得我吗？
Remember me?

1203
01:39:35,340 --> 01:39:38,760
我会紧贴着鲁斯的车
I'm going to draft Wheeler, make him pull me around the track.

1204
01:39:42,430 --> 01:39:44,140
那混蛋紧跟着我
The son of a bitch is on my ass.

1205
01:39:47,730 --> 01:39:51,940
他想在外线爬头  我会逼他撞墙
He's going to take me on the outside. I'm going to put him in the wall.

1206
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:04,540
发生什么事？ 他要令他上当
- What's going on, Cole? - I'm just setting him up, Harry.

1207
01:40:04,660 --> 01:40:07,540
大会出示白旗，还有一圈
There's the white flag. One lap to go.

1208
01:40:07,620 --> 01:40:09,080
最后一圈了
Last lap, Cole.

1209
01:40:22,510 --> 01:40:27,640
不要再这样下去  哈利，他输定了
- Don't keep this up, Cole, please. - Harry, this guy's going down.

1210
01:40:33,190 --> 01:40:36,330
最后一圈，小心  他想爬头
Last turn, be careful. He's going to try and slingshot past you, Russ.

1211
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:39,780
少担心，高总是从外圈爬头
Don't worry, I know Cole. He always goes to the outside.

1212
01:40:41,490 --> 01:40:43,450
哈利，这一招送给你
This one's for you, Harry.

1213
01:40:45,620 --> 01:40:47,410
他走外圈
He's going high.

1214
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:52,500
他走内圈
He's going low!

1215
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:56,000
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch!

1216
01:41:00,930 --> 01:41:04,260
狄高首先冲线
Here come the cars to the finish line, it's Cole Trickle taking the win.

1217
01:41:04,350 --> 01:41:05,890
好
All right! All right!

1218
01:41:45,350 --> 01:41:48,220
我以为你走了  我说谎
- I thought you weren't gonna watch. - I lied.

1219
01:41:55,610 --> 01:41:57,900
-哈利呢？ -不知道…
- Where's Harry? - I don't know.

1220
01:42:07,910 --> 01:42:09,160
哈利
Harry.

1221
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:14,750
说句话吧
Harry, say something, will you?

1222
01:42:15,790 --> 01:42:17,750
我无话可说
I really can't. I can't.

1223
01:42:22,670 --> 01:42:26,430
你猜不到会这样吧
You didn't know how this one was going to turn out, did you?

1224
01:42:26,930 --> 01:42:28,760
正如你所说
It's like you said.

1225
01:42:31,100 --> 01:42:33,980
赛车难不倒你
There's nothing you can't do in a racecar.

1226
01:42:35,270 --> 01:42:38,730
我们赢了  -我们赢了  -是
- We won. We won. - I know. Yeah.

1227
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:44,450
你走得动吗？要我背你吗？
Now, can you walk, or am I going to have to carry you?

1228
01:42:44,530 --> 01:42:45,860
去哪里？
Where to?

1229
01:42:47,030 --> 01:42:50,240
凯旋大道  好
- Victory Lane. - Yeah.

1230
01:42:52,580 --> 01:42:54,540
走路？
Walk? Hell,

1231
01:42:57,960 --> 01:42:59,550
看谁跑得快
I'll race your ass.
