1
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:24,779
You wished to speak to me, Doctor?

2
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:27,365
<i>Have you seen Mrs. Vogler yet, Sister Alma?</i>

3
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,491
No, not yet.

4
00:07:28,617 --> 00:07:30,702
<i>Let me explain her situation</i>

5
00:07:30,827 --> 00:07:34,456
<i>and why you've been hired to care for her.</i>

6
00:07:35,415 --> 00:07:37,917
<i>Mrs. Vogler is an actress, as you know.</i>

7
00:07:38,043 --> 00:07:41,421
<i>In the middle of her lest performance of Electra,</i>

8
00:07:41,921 --> 00:07:46,134
<i>she fell silent and looked around as if in surprise.</i>

9
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:48,887
<i>She was silent for over a minute.</i>

10
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:04,319
<i>She apologized to her colleagues afterward,</i>

11
00:08:04,486 --> 00:08:07,155
<i>saying she'd felt
a sudden urge to laugh.</i>

12
00:08:07,489 --> 00:08:09,658
<i>The next day
the theater called</i>

13
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:12,577
<i>to ask if she'd forgotten
about rehearsal.</i>

14
00:08:12,702 --> 00:08:16,331
<i>The maid went in her room
and found her still in bed.</i>

15
00:08:16,498 --> 00:08:19,751
<i>She was awake but wouldn't
answer questions or move.</i>

16
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,755
This condition's gone on
for three months now.

17
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,633
She's been given
every conceivable test.

18
00:08:26,925 --> 00:08:28,843
The result is clear:

19
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:32,472
She's perfectly healthy,
both mentally and physically.

20
00:08:32,597 --> 00:08:36,309
And it's not a question
of some hysterical reaction either.

21
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:38,895
Any questions,
Sister Alma?

22
00:08:39,354 --> 00:08:43,108
If not, you can go
see Mrs. Vogler now.

23
00:08:51,157 --> 00:08:53,201
Hello, Mrs. Vogler.

24
00:08:54,703 --> 00:08:56,663
I'm Sister Alma.

25
00:08:56,788 --> 00:09:00,291
I've been hired to take care
of you for a while.

26
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,463
Perhaps I should tell you
a bit about myself.

27
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:08,216
I'm 25 years old,
and I'm engaged.

28
00:09:08,508 --> 00:09:11,678
I got my nursing certificate
two years ago.

29
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:15,056
My parents have
a farm in the country.

30
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:19,436
My mother was a nurse too,
before she got married.

31
00:09:21,146 --> 00:09:24,899
I should go get your dinner tray -
fried liver and fruit salad.

32
00:09:25,108 --> 00:09:27,152
It looked quite good.

33
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:31,823
Shall I raise this end up?
Are you all right like that?

34
00:09:38,413 --> 00:09:42,041
<i>Sister Alma,
what's your first impression?</i>

35
00:09:43,001 --> 00:09:45,670
I don't know
what to say, Doctor.

36
00:09:46,087 --> 00:09:49,507
At first her face looks soft,
almost childish,

37
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:51,968
but then
you see her eyes...

38
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,929
Her expression's so hard.

39
00:09:55,805 --> 00:09:57,807
Perhaps I shouldn't...

40
00:09:57,932 --> 00:10:00,101
<i>What were you going to say?</i>

41
00:10:00,393 --> 00:10:02,937
I was thinking I should
turn down the assignment.

42
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:05,607
<i>Why? Did something
frighten you?</i>

43
00:10:05,774 --> 00:10:07,859
No, not exactly,

44
00:10:07,984 --> 00:10:11,696
but perhaps Mrs. Vogler
should have an older nurse,

45
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:13,865
one with more life experience.

46
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:17,285
I might not be able to manage.
- Manage? In what way?

47
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,621
- Mentally.
- Mentally?

48
00:10:20,246 --> 00:10:24,083
If she's made a conscious
decision not to speak or move,

49
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:26,628
which must be the case,
since she's healthy...

50
00:10:26,753 --> 00:10:28,379
<i>Then?</i>

51
00:10:28,505 --> 00:10:31,716
Then that shows
great mental strength.

52
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:33,843
I may not be up to it.

53
00:10:35,804 --> 00:10:38,515
I thought you might want
to see the twilight.

54
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,683
I can draw
the curtains later.

55
00:10:43,645 --> 00:10:45,688
Shall I turn on the radio?

56
00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:48,191
I think there's a play on.

57
00:10:50,026 --> 00:10:52,654
<i>Forgive me, darling.</i>

58
00:10:53,112 --> 00:10:55,949
<i>You must forgive me.</i>

59
00:10:56,115 --> 00:10:59,869
<i>All I want
is your forgiveness.</i>

60
00:11:01,246 --> 00:11:05,500
What are you laughing about?
Ls the actress so funny?

61
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:10,255
<i>What do you know
of mercy? Well?</i>

62
00:11:11,756 --> 00:11:14,259
<i>What do you know
of mercy?</i>

63
00:11:19,264 --> 00:11:22,141
I don't understand
those sorts of things.

64
00:11:22,934 --> 00:11:25,103
I enjoy films
and the theater,

65
00:11:25,228 --> 00:11:27,856
but I'm afraid
I don't go very often.

66
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:31,025
I have tremendous
admiration for artists.

67
00:11:31,693 --> 00:11:35,780
I think art is enormously
important in life,

68
00:11:35,905 --> 00:11:40,034
especially for those struggling
for one reason or another.

69
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:46,124
But I'm skating on thin ice,
telling you about such things.

70
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,793
Let's see
if I can find some music.

71
00:11:50,128 --> 00:11:51,880
Is that all right?

72
00:11:54,674 --> 00:11:56,968
Good night, then.
Sleep well.

73
00:13:48,204 --> 00:13:50,081
Damn it.

74
00:13:58,006 --> 00:13:59,716
It's funny.

75
00:14:00,383 --> 00:14:02,969
You can go about
as you please...

76
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,055
doing almost anything
you please.

77
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,645
<i>I'll</i> marry Karl-Henrik
and we'll have a couple kids,

78
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,814
whom <i>I'll</i> raise.

79
00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:18,860
It's all decided.
It's inside me.

80
00:14:19,694 --> 00:14:22,238
I don't even have
to think about it.

81
00:14:23,364 --> 00:14:25,616
It's a great feeling
of security.

82
00:14:26,743 --> 00:14:29,912
I have a job
I like and enjoy.

83
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:32,915
That's good too...

84
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,752
but in another way.

85
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:38,379
But it's good.

86
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,381
<i>Yes...</i>

87
00:14:42,258 --> 00:14:43,885
it's good.

88
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:54,479
I wonder what's really
wrong with her.

89
00:14:57,398 --> 00:14:59,400
Elisabet Vogler.

90
00:16:40,585 --> 00:16:43,504
Mrs. Vogler, would you like me
to open the letter?

91
00:16:50,553 --> 00:16:52,430
Shall I read it?

92
00:16:58,311 --> 00:17:00,438
Shall I read it to you?

93
00:17:08,946 --> 00:17:10,740
“Dearest Elisabet,

94
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,702
since I'm not allowed
to see you, I'm writing instead.

95
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:18,664
If you don't wish to read
my letter, you can ignore it.

96
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:25,213
But I can't help trying
to contact you this way,

97
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:28,716
as I'm tormented
by a persistent question:

98
00:17:28,925 --> 00:17:31,552
Have I done you harm
in some way?

99
00:17:31,677 --> 00:17:34,639
Have I unknowingly
hurt you somehow?

100
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:39,560
Was there some terrible
misunderstanding between us?”

101
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:48,152
Should I really go on?

102
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:59,747
“As far as I know,
we've been happy recently.

103
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:01,874
Surely we've never been...

104
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,418
so close.

105
00:18:05,962 --> 00:18:08,589
Do you remember saying,

106
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:11,175
'I'm only just beginning
to understand

107
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,552
what it means
to be married'?

108
00:18:13,678 --> 00:18:15,680
'You've taught me...”'

109
00:18:16,347 --> 00:18:18,432
I can't make it out.

110
00:18:19,267 --> 00:18:22,103
“'You've taught...”'
Now I see.

111
00:18:22,478 --> 00:18:25,982
“'You've taught me
that we must see each other

112
00:18:26,107 --> 00:18:29,026
as two anxious children

113
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:33,155
full of goodwill
and the best of intentions

114
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:37,576
but gov-”'
Now I see.

115
00:18:37,702 --> 00:18:42,123
“'...governed by forces
we can only partially control.'

116
00:18:42,832 --> 00:18:45,459
Do you remember
saying all that?

117
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:49,297
We were walking
in the woods,

118
00:18:49,422 --> 00:18:52,341
and you stopped and grabbed
the belt of my coat -”

119
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:03,477
There was a picture
with the letter.

120
00:19:04,312 --> 00:19:07,982
A picture of your son.
I don't know if...

121
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:11,027
Do you want it,
Mrs. Vogler?

122
00:19:12,987 --> 00:19:15,197
He looks awfully cute.

123
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,399
Elisabet, I don't think
there's any point

124
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:52,943
in your staying here
in the hospital.

125
00:19:53,152 --> 00:19:55,237
It's just hurting you
to be here.

126
00:19:55,363 --> 00:19:57,531
Since you don't want
to go home,

127
00:19:57,656 --> 00:19:59,825
I suggest you
and Sister Alma move out

128
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,036
to my summer place
by the sea.

129
00:20:04,205 --> 00:20:06,540
You think
I don't understand?

130
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,835
The hopeless dream
of being.

131
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,254
Not seeming to be,
but being.

132
00:20:14,382 --> 00:20:18,302
Conscious and awake
at every moment.

133
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:22,723
At the same time, the chasm
between what you are to others

134
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,934
and what you are
to yourself.

135
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:28,312
The feeling of vertigo,
and the constant hunger

136
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:31,065
to be unmasked
once and for all.

137
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:35,236
To be seen through,
cut down...

138
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:38,239
perhaps even annihilated.

139
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:43,202
Every tone of voice a lie,
every gesture a falsehood,

140
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:45,371
every smile a grimace.

141
00:20:46,414 --> 00:20:48,666
Commit suicide?

142
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,919
No, too nasty.

143
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:55,089
One doesn't do
things like that.

144
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:58,592
But you can refuse
to move or talk.

145
00:20:58,843 --> 00:21:00,970
Then at least
you're not lying.

146
00:21:01,095 --> 00:21:04,515
You can cut yourself off,
close yourself in.

147
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,851
Then you needn't
play any roles,

148
00:21:06,976 --> 00:21:09,895
wear any masks,
make any false gestures.

149
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,022
So you might think...

150
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,942
but reality plays
nasty tricks on you.

151
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:18,279
Your hiding place
isn't watertight enough.

152
00:21:18,446 --> 00:21:21,282
Life oozes in from all sides.

153
00:21:24,577 --> 00:21:26,704
You're forced to react.

154
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:31,041
No one asks
whether it's genuine or not,

155
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:33,878
whether you're lying
or telling the truth.

156
00:21:34,003 --> 00:21:37,089
Questions like that
only matter in the theater,

157
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:39,258
and hardly even there.

158
00:21:40,551 --> 00:21:42,636
I understand you,
Elisabet.

159
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:45,890
I understand that you're
not speaking or moving,

160
00:21:46,474 --> 00:21:50,478
that you've turned this apathy
into a fantastic setup.

161
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:53,814
I understand
and admire you.

162
00:21:55,107 --> 00:21:59,153
I think you should play this part
until it's played out,

163
00:21:59,862 --> 00:22:02,239
until it's no longer
interesting.

164
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:05,993
Then you can drop it,
just as you eventually drop

165
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:08,954
all your other roles.

166
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:16,295
<i>Thus, at the end of the summer,
Mrs. Vogler and Sister Alma</i>

167
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,839
<i>move out to the doctor's
summer house.</i>

168
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:23,052
<i>The stay by the sea agrees
very well with the actress.</i>

169
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:26,055
<i>Her crippling apathy
at the hospital</i>

170
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:29,058
<i>gives way to long walks,
fishing excursions,</i>

171
00:22:29,183 --> 00:22:32,269
<i>cooking, letter writing,
and other diversions.</i>

172
00:22:33,187 --> 00:22:36,023
<i>Sister Alma enjoys
the seclusion of the countryside</i>

173
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:39,193
<i>and tends to her patient
with utmost care.</i>

174
00:23:21,235 --> 00:23:24,572
Don't you know it's bad luck
to compare hands?

175
00:23:43,132 --> 00:23:45,050
<i>Elisabet...</i>

176
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:47,636
<i>may I read you
something from my book?</i>

177
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:49,722
<i>Or am I disturbing you?</i>

178
00:23:49,847 --> 00:23:51,557
<i>Here's what it says:</i>

179
00:23:51,682 --> 00:23:54,393
<i>“All the anxiety
we carry within us,</i>

180
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:58,772
<i>all our thwarted dreams,
the inexplicable cruelty,</i>

181
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:01,108
<i>our fear of extinction,</i>

182
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:04,320
<i>the painful insight
into our earthly condition</i>

183
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:10,451
have slowly crystallized our hope
for an other-worldly salvation.

184
00:24:10,993 --> 00:24:13,787
The tremendous cry
of our faith and doubt

185
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:16,081
against the darkness
and silence

186
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:20,044
is the most terrifying proof
of our abandonment

187
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:23,297
and our unuttered knowledge.”

188
00:24:25,341 --> 00:24:27,635
Do you think that's true?

189
00:24:31,639 --> 00:24:33,807
I don't believe that.

190
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:38,646
To change...
but I'm so lazy.

191
00:24:39,063 --> 00:24:41,398
And then
I feel guilty about it.

192
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:43,901
Karl-Henrik scolds me
for not having any ambition,

193
00:24:44,026 --> 00:24:46,236
for going around
like I'm sleepwalking.

194
00:24:46,362 --> 00:24:48,197
I think that's unfair.

195
00:24:48,322 --> 00:24:50,866
I graduated highest
in my class.

196
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:53,243
But maybe he means
something else.

197
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:58,457
You know -
Oh, sorry.

198
00:24:58,582 --> 00:25:01,335
You know what
I think about sometimes?

199
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,380
At the hospital
where I took my exam,

200
00:25:04,505 --> 00:25:06,674
there's a home
for old nurses

201
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,302
who were nurses all their lives
and lived for their work

202
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:12,763
and were always
in uniform.

203
00:25:12,888 --> 00:25:14,973
They live
in their little rooms there.

204
00:25:15,099 --> 00:25:17,976
Imagine believing
so strongly in something

205
00:25:18,102 --> 00:25:20,020
that you devote
your entire life to it.

206
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:23,107
Having something to believe in,
working at something,

207
00:25:23,232 --> 00:25:26,026
believing
your life has meaning.

208
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:27,903
I like that.

209
00:25:28,404 --> 00:25:31,532
Holding on tight to something,
no matter what...

210
00:25:31,657 --> 00:25:33,575
I think that's how
it should be.

211
00:25:33,701 --> 00:25:36,537
Meaning something
to other people.

212
00:25:36,704 --> 00:25:38,789
Don't you agree?

213
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:46,338
I know it sounds childish,
but I believe in that.

214
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:50,217
What a downpour!

215
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:54,430
Oh, yes, he was married.

216
00:25:54,722 --> 00:25:57,099
We had an affair
for five years.

217
00:25:57,224 --> 00:25:59,810
Then he got tired of it,
of course.

218
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:03,856
I was terribly in love,
and he was the first.

219
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:07,443
I remember it all
like one long torment.

220
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:12,281
Long periods of agony,
and brief moments when...

221
00:26:13,782 --> 00:26:16,827
Your teaching me
how to smoke reminded me.

222
00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:18,954
He smoked constantly.

223
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:22,040
In hindsight
it all seems so dreary.

224
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:24,418
A real dime store novel.

225
00:26:26,462 --> 00:26:29,757
In some strange way
it was never quite real.

226
00:26:30,841 --> 00:26:33,427
I don't know how
to explain it.

227
00:26:33,844 --> 00:26:36,764
At least, I was never
quite real to him.

228
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:40,976
But my pain was real,
that's for sure.

229
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:45,606
But that was somehow
all a part of it

230
00:26:45,731 --> 00:26:47,816
in some nasty way,

231
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:50,694
as if that's how
it was supposed to be.

232
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:54,239
Even the things
we said to each other.

233
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:04,500
Lots of people have told me
I'm a good listener.

234
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:06,460
Isn't that funny?

235
00:27:06,585 --> 00:27:09,379
No one's ever bothered
to listen to me.

236
00:27:09,505 --> 00:27:12,466
Like you're doing now.
You're really listening.

237
00:27:12,633 --> 00:27:16,470
I think you're the first person
who's ever listened to me.

238
00:27:16,637 --> 00:27:18,806
It can't be at all interesting.

239
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:21,266
You could be reading
a good book instead.

240
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:23,977
How I'm going on!
I hope I'm not irritating you.

241
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:28,440
It feels so good to talk.
It feels nice and warm.

242
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:31,902
I've never felt like this
in all my life.

243
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:36,156
I've always wanted
a sister.

244
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:38,867
I have loads of brothers -
seven.

245
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:41,078
Strange, eh?
Then I came along.

246
00:27:41,203 --> 00:27:44,706
I remember being surrounded
by boys all my life.

247
00:27:45,499 --> 00:27:47,501
But I like boys.

248
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,837
But I'm sure
you know that,

249
00:27:49,962 --> 00:27:52,881
with all your experience
as an actress.

250
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:56,093
I like Karl-Henrik so much,

251
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:59,680
but you really
only love once.

252
00:27:59,805 --> 00:28:01,849
I'm faithful to him.

253
00:28:01,974 --> 00:28:05,978
Opportunities come up
in this line of work, I can tell you.

254
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:12,568
Karl-Henrik and I rented
a cottage by the sea once.

255
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:16,071
It was June,
and we were all alone.

256
00:28:17,573 --> 00:28:19,992
One day, when Karl-Henrik
had gone into town,

257
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:22,327
I went to the beach
on my own.

258
00:28:22,703 --> 00:28:25,330
It was a warm
and lovely day.

259
00:28:27,124 --> 00:28:29,668
There was
another girl there.

260
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:32,754
She'd paddled over
from another island

261
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,550
because our beach
was sunnier and more secluded.

262
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:41,722
We lay there sunbathing beside
one another, completely naked,

263
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:45,934
dozing now and then,
putting suntan lotion on.

264
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:51,481
We had those cheap
straw hats on, you know?

265
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:55,652
I had a blue ribbon
around mine.

266
00:28:58,113 --> 00:29:01,283
I lay there peeping out
from under my hat

267
00:29:01,575 --> 00:29:05,579
at the landscape
and the sea and the sun.

268
00:29:05,913 --> 00:29:07,956
It was kind of funny.

269
00:29:13,587 --> 00:29:17,883
Suddenly I saw two figures leaping
about on the rocks above us.

270
00:29:19,927 --> 00:29:22,679
They would hide
and then peek out.

271
00:29:23,764 --> 00:29:26,808
“There's a couple boys
looking at us, ” I told the girl.

272
00:29:26,934 --> 00:29:28,936
Her name was Katarina.

273
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:33,941
“Let them look, ” she said,
and turned over on her back.

274
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:37,945
It was a strange feeling.

275
00:29:38,445 --> 00:29:41,406
I wanted to jump up
and put on my robe,

276
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:43,951
but I just lay there
on my stomach

277
00:29:44,117 --> 00:29:46,244
with my bottom in the air,

278
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:49,790
not at all embarrassed,
completely calm.

279
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:55,379
Katarina lay there
next to me the whole time,

280
00:29:55,504 --> 00:29:58,507
with her breasts
and thick thighs.

281
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:02,469
She just lay there
sort of giggling to herself.

282
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:07,683
I noticed that the boys
had come closer.

283
00:30:07,808 --> 00:30:10,894
They just stood there
looking at us.

284
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:14,690
I noticed
they were terribly young.

285
00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:19,987
Then one of them -
the more daring of the two...

286
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:24,616
came up and squatted down
next to Katarina.

287
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:29,955
He pretended to be busy
picking at his toes.

288
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:34,876
I felt so strange.

289
00:30:37,212 --> 00:30:39,840
Suddenly
I heard Katarina say,

290
00:30:40,382 --> 00:30:43,760
“Hey, why don't you
come over here?”

291
00:30:44,678 --> 00:30:46,680
She took him by the hand

292
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:49,266
and helped him off
with his jeans and shirt.

293
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:51,685
Then suddenly
he was on top of her.

294
00:30:52,477 --> 00:30:55,981
She guided him in
with her hands on his behind.

295
00:30:57,566 --> 00:31:00,694
The other boy just sat
on the slope and watched.

296
00:31:01,862 --> 00:31:05,699
I heard Katarina whisper
in the boy's ear and laugh.

297
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:09,870
His face was
right next to mine.

298
00:31:10,704 --> 00:31:13,457
It was red and swollen.

299
00:31:16,293 --> 00:31:18,503
Suddenly
I turned over and said,

300
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:21,256
“Aren't you coming
over to me too?”

301
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,968
And Katarina said,
“Go to her now.”

302
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:27,304
He pulled out of her

303
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:30,599
and fell on top of me,
completely hard.

304
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:32,768
He grabbed my breast.

305
00:31:32,893 --> 00:31:34,895
It hurt so bad!

306
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:39,566
I was ready somehow
and came almost at once.

307
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:41,568
Can you believe it?

308
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:46,865
I was about to say,
“Careful you don't get me pregnant”

309
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,201
when he suddenly came.

310
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:52,871
I felt it like
never before in my life,

311
00:31:53,246 --> 00:31:56,249
the way he sprayed
his seed into me.

312
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,795
He gripped my shoulders
and arched backward.

313
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,255
I came over and over.

314
00:32:05,675 --> 00:32:08,053
Katarina lay on her side
and watched

315
00:32:08,178 --> 00:32:10,722
and held him from behind.

316
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:16,311
After he came,
she took him in her arms

317
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:19,064
and used his hand
to make herself come.

318
00:32:19,815 --> 00:32:21,441
When she came,

319
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:23,819
she screamed
like a banshee.

320
00:32:29,783 --> 00:32:32,869
Then all three of us
started laughing.

321
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:36,665
We called to the other boy,
who was sitting on the slope.

322
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,792
His name was Peter.

323
00:32:43,004 --> 00:32:45,132
He came down,
looking all confused

324
00:32:45,257 --> 00:32:47,551
and shivering
despite the sunshine.

325
00:32:50,178 --> 00:32:54,015
Katarina unbuttoned his pants
and started to play with him.

326
00:32:55,225 --> 00:32:58,478
And when he came,
she took him in her mouth.

327
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:02,482
He bent down
and kissed her back.

328
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:06,069
She turned around,
took his head in both hands,

329
00:33:06,194 --> 00:33:07,904
and gave him her breast.

330
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:12,033
The other boy got so excited
that he and I started all over again.

331
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,328
It was just as good
as before.

332
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,959
Then we went for a swim
and parted ways.

333
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:24,921
When I got home, Karl-Henrik
was already back from town.

334
00:33:27,591 --> 00:33:31,344
We ate dinner and drank
some red wine he'd brought.

335
00:33:33,722 --> 00:33:35,765
Then we had sex.

336
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:40,270
It's never been as good,
before or since.

337
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,022
Can you understand that?

338
00:33:42,772 --> 00:33:45,609
I ended up pregnant,
of course.

339
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:49,196
Karl-Henrik,
who's studying medicine,

340
00:33:49,321 --> 00:33:53,366
took me to a good friend of his,
who performed an abortion.

341
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,537
We were both relieved.
We didn't want children.

342
00:33:57,913 --> 00:34:00,207
Not then, anyway.

343
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:09,049
It doesn't make any sense.

344
00:34:09,799 --> 00:34:12,302
Nothing fits together.

345
00:34:13,261 --> 00:34:16,431
And the guilty conscience
you feel over little things.

346
00:34:16,556 --> 00:34:18,558
You understand?

347
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:21,978
And what about all the things
you'd decided to do?

348
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:24,898
Don't you have
to do them anymore?

349
00:34:26,566 --> 00:34:28,526
Is it possible to be

350
00:34:28,652 --> 00:34:31,655
one and the same person
at the very same time...

351
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,823
I mean, two people?

352
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:36,117
God, I'm being silly!

353
00:34:36,451 --> 00:34:39,746
Anyway, there's no reason
to start blubbering.

354
00:34:40,664 --> 00:34:43,083
<i>I'll</i> get a handkerchief.

355
00:35:04,562 --> 00:35:06,523
It's almost morning...

356
00:35:07,524 --> 00:35:09,901
and it's still raining.

357
00:35:16,616 --> 00:35:19,244
I've been talking nonstop

358
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:21,454
while you've just listened.

359
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:23,373
How boring for you.

360
00:35:23,498 --> 00:35:26,501
What could possibly
interest you about my life?

361
00:35:27,168 --> 00:35:29,462
People should be like you.

362
00:35:30,922 --> 00:35:33,008
You know what I thought

363
00:35:33,133 --> 00:35:35,802
after I saw a film
of yours one night?

364
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:38,805
When I got home and looked
in the mirror, I thought,

365
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:40,932
“We look alike.”

366
00:35:41,933 --> 00:35:44,352
Don't get me wrong.
You're much more beautiful.

367
00:35:44,477 --> 00:35:46,479
But we're alike somehow.

368
00:35:46,646 --> 00:35:50,900
I think I could turn into you
if I really tried.

369
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:53,320
I mean inside.

370
00:35:55,155 --> 00:35:58,325
You could be me
just like that...

371
00:35:59,617 --> 00:36:02,078
though your soul
would be far too big.

372
00:36:02,203 --> 00:36:04,664
It would stick out
everywhere!

373
00:36:08,126 --> 00:36:10,170
<i>Go to bed...</i>

374
00:36:10,295 --> 00:36:13,006
<i>or you'll fall asleep
here at the table.</i>

375
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:29,064
I must go to bed now

376
00:36:29,314 --> 00:36:31,524
or <i>I'll</i> fall asleep
at the table,

377
00:36:31,691 --> 00:36:34,069
and that would be
rather uncomfortable.

378
00:36:37,864 --> 00:36:39,366
Good night.

379
00:39:39,837 --> 00:39:41,548
Elisabet...

380
00:39:44,259 --> 00:39:46,719
did you speak to me
last night?

381
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:20,753
Were you
in my room last night?

382
00:41:03,338 --> 00:41:05,673
Shall I take your mail too?

383
00:41:07,008 --> 00:41:08,885
Let me have a taste.

384
00:41:10,803 --> 00:41:12,263
See ya.

385
00:42:19,122 --> 00:42:22,083
“Dear friend,
I could live like this forever.

386
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:25,169
The silence, the seclusion,
reducing my needs,

387
00:42:25,294 --> 00:42:29,215
feeling my battered soul finally
start to straighten itself out.

388
00:42:34,554 --> 00:42:37,890
Alma pampers me
in the most touching way.

389
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:43,896
I think she's actually enjoying it here
and that she's very fond of me,

390
00:42:44,021 --> 00:42:47,984
perhaps even a bit smitten
in a charming, subconscious way.

391
00:42:48,109 --> 00:42:51,738
In any case,
it's a lot of fun studying her.

392
00:43:00,997 --> 00:43:04,000
Sometimes she cries
over past sins...

393
00:43:04,125 --> 00:43:07,211
an orgy with a strange boy
and a subsequent abortion.

394
00:43:07,336 --> 00:43:10,131
She complains
that her notions about life

395
00:43:10,256 --> 00:43:13,009
fail to accord with her actions.”

396
00:48:57,436 --> 00:48:59,605
I see
you're reading a play.

397
00:49:00,064 --> 00:49:03,400
That's a healthy sign.
<i>I'll</i> tell the doctor.

398
00:49:06,737 --> 00:49:08,823
You think we should
leave here soon?

399
00:49:08,948 --> 00:49:11,158
I'm starting
to miss the city.

400
00:49:11,659 --> 00:49:13,369
Aren't you?

401
00:49:29,051 --> 00:49:32,096
Would you like
to make me really happy?

402
00:49:33,305 --> 00:49:36,976
I know it's asking a lot,
but I could use your help right now.

403
00:49:37,518 --> 00:49:39,103
Nothing dangerous.

404
00:49:39,228 --> 00:49:41,981
But I do wish
you'd talk to me.

405
00:49:42,106 --> 00:49:44,316
Doesn't have to be
anything special.

406
00:49:44,483 --> 00:49:47,987
We could talk about anything -
what to have for dinner,

407
00:49:48,112 --> 00:49:50,739
whether the water's
cold now after the storm,

408
00:49:50,865 --> 00:49:53,325
whether it's too cold
to go swimming.

409
00:49:53,492 --> 00:49:56,579
Just talk for a few minutes.
One minute.

410
00:49:56,704 --> 00:49:58,998
You could read to me
from your book.

411
00:49:59,165 --> 00:50:00,583
Just say a few words.

412
00:50:03,544 --> 00:50:05,671
I have to try
not to get angry.

413
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:07,965
It's your business
if you want to keep quiet.

414
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:11,093
But I need you
to talk to me now.

415
00:50:13,721 --> 00:50:15,556
Can't you just say

416
00:50:15,681 --> 00:50:17,224
one word?

417
00:50:19,852 --> 00:50:21,937
I knew you'd refuse.

418
00:50:23,147 --> 00:50:25,357
You can't know how I feel.

419
00:50:26,984 --> 00:50:29,361
I always thought great artists

420
00:50:29,528 --> 00:50:32,448
felt this great compassion
for other people...

421
00:50:33,157 --> 00:50:35,910
that they created
out of great compassion

422
00:50:36,035 --> 00:50:38,037
and a need to help.

423
00:50:38,204 --> 00:50:40,206
That was silly of me.

424
00:50:43,876 --> 00:50:46,754
You've used me.
For what, I don't know.

425
00:50:46,879 --> 00:50:50,382
Now that you don't need me
anymore, you toss me aside.

426
00:50:50,507 --> 00:50:54,220
Yes, I hear perfectly well
how phony that sounds!

427
00:50:54,345 --> 00:50:56,805
“You've used me, and now
you're tossing me aside.”

428
00:50:56,931 --> 00:51:00,059
But it's true - every word.
And these glasses!

429
00:51:09,068 --> 00:51:11,070
You've hurt me badly.

430
00:51:11,862 --> 00:51:14,531
You've been laughing at me
behind my back.

431
00:51:16,408 --> 00:51:18,869
I read the letter
you wrote to the doctor.

432
00:51:18,994 --> 00:51:23,082
It wasn't sealed,
and I read the whole thing.

433
00:51:25,042 --> 00:51:27,294
You got me to talk,

434
00:51:27,419 --> 00:51:29,755
to tell you things
I've never told anyone.

435
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:33,008
Then you go and pass it on.
Great study material, eh?

436
00:51:33,133 --> 00:51:34,718
You're not...

437
00:51:34,969 --> 00:51:36,971
You're going to talk now!

438
00:51:37,096 --> 00:51:40,349
If you have something
to say, by God...

439
00:51:53,612 --> 00:51:55,281
No, don't!

440
00:52:07,167 --> 00:52:09,628
Scared there for a minute,
weren't you?

441
00:52:11,463 --> 00:52:15,342
For a second you were
genuinely scared, weren't you?

442
00:52:15,926 --> 00:52:18,470
A genuine
fear of death, huh?

443
00:52:19,054 --> 00:52:21,640
“Alma's gone crazy, ”
you thought.

444
00:52:21,807 --> 00:52:24,393
Just what kind of person
are you anyway?

445
00:52:25,269 --> 00:52:28,856
Or maybe you just thought,
<i>“I'll</i> remember that face,

446
00:52:28,981 --> 00:52:31,692
that tone of voice,
that expression.”

447
00:52:31,817 --> 00:52:34,320
<i>I'll</i> give you something
you won't forget!

448
00:52:56,175 --> 00:52:58,010
You're laughing, are you?

449
00:52:59,762 --> 00:53:02,181
Things aren't
that simple for me.

450
00:53:02,723 --> 00:53:04,683
Or so funny either.

451
00:53:05,768 --> 00:53:08,020
But you always have
your laugh.

452
00:54:33,355 --> 00:54:35,607
Does it have
to be like this?

453
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:42,489
Is it really so important
not to lie, to tell the truth,

454
00:54:42,614 --> 00:54:44,950
to speak in a genuine
tone of voice?

455
00:54:45,951 --> 00:54:49,288
Can a person really live
without babbling away,

456
00:54:49,455 --> 00:54:53,500
without lying and making up
excuses and evading things?

457
00:54:54,793 --> 00:54:57,379
Isn't it better
to just let yourself

458
00:54:57,504 --> 00:55:00,340
be silly and sloppy
and dishonest?

459
00:55:02,092 --> 00:55:06,305
Maybe a person gets better by just
letting herself be who she is.

460
00:55:10,142 --> 00:55:12,144
No, you don't understand.

461
00:55:13,228 --> 00:55:14,980
You don't understand
what I'm saying.

462
00:55:15,147 --> 00:55:17,191
There's no reaching
someone like you.

463
00:55:17,316 --> 00:55:19,276
The doctor said
you're mentally healthy,

464
00:55:19,401 --> 00:55:21,487
but I wonder if your madness
isn't the worst kind.

465
00:55:21,653 --> 00:55:23,322
You act healthy,

466
00:55:23,489 --> 00:55:25,991
and the worst thing is,
everyone believes you.

467
00:55:26,116 --> 00:55:29,328
Except me, because
I know how rotten you are.

468
00:55:35,709 --> 00:55:37,503
God, what am I doing?

469
00:55:41,006 --> 00:55:43,133
Elisabet, forgive me.

470
00:55:43,258 --> 00:55:45,219
I'm behaving like an idiot.

471
00:55:45,344 --> 00:55:48,972
I don't know what got into me.
I'm here to help you.

472
00:55:49,097 --> 00:55:51,683
It was that awful letter.

473
00:55:51,892 --> 00:55:53,852
I was so disappointed.

474
00:55:54,019 --> 00:55:57,439
You asked me
to talk about myself.

475
00:55:58,023 --> 00:56:00,651
It felt so good. You seemed
so kind and understanding.

476
00:56:00,776 --> 00:56:02,861
I'd had a lot to drink,

477
00:56:03,028 --> 00:56:05,489
and it felt so good
to talk about it all.

478
00:56:05,614 --> 00:56:07,950
And I suppose
I was flattered

479
00:56:08,075 --> 00:56:11,537
that a great actress like you
would bother to listen.

480
00:56:11,703 --> 00:56:14,289
I even thought
it would be nice if what I said

481
00:56:14,414 --> 00:56:16,708
were of some use to you.

482
00:56:17,209 --> 00:56:20,712
But that's awful, isn't it?
Sheer exhibitionism.

483
00:56:20,879 --> 00:56:23,882
Elisabet,
I want you to forgive me.

484
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:27,261
I like you so much.
You mean so much to me.

485
00:56:27,386 --> 00:56:29,304
I've learned
so much from you.

486
00:56:29,429 --> 00:56:31,306
Let's not part as enemies.

487
00:56:54,413 --> 00:56:58,250
You won't forgive me
because you're too proud!

488
00:56:58,375 --> 00:57:02,254
You won't stoop to my level
because you don't have to!

489
00:57:02,421 --> 00:57:05,424
I won't...

490
01:01:11,461 --> 01:01:13,505
<i>we don't speak...</i>

491
01:01:13,672 --> 01:01:14,881
<i>don't listen...</i>

492
01:01:15,006 --> 01:01:16,716
<i>can't understand...</i>

493
01:01:21,471 --> 01:01:23,139
<i>what means...</i>

494
01:01:23,265 --> 01:01:25,642
<i>to persuade...to listen...</i>

495
01:02:09,144 --> 01:02:11,980
When you sleep,
your face goes slack...

496
01:02:14,858 --> 01:02:17,527
and your mouth
is swollen and ugly.

497
01:02:20,572 --> 01:02:23,241
There's a nasty wrinkle
on your forehead.

498
01:02:31,499 --> 01:02:34,252
You smell
of sleep and tears...

499
01:02:38,256 --> 01:02:41,009
and I can see
the pulse in your neck.

500
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:45,305
There's a scar there
that you cover with makeup.

501
01:02:51,436 --> 01:02:53,480
He's calling again.

502
01:02:55,023 --> 01:02:57,525
<i>I'll</i> find out
what he wants from us...

503
01:02:58,526 --> 01:03:01,529
far away out here
in our solitude.

504
01:03:28,682 --> 01:03:30,809
Sorry if I frightened you.

505
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:33,895
I'm not Elisabet.

506
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:36,690
I'm not here
to make demands.

507
01:03:37,148 --> 01:03:39,275
I didn't mean to disturb you.

508
01:03:39,484 --> 01:03:41,569
You think
I don't understand?

509
01:03:41,695 --> 01:03:44,489
The doctor
explained everything.

510
01:03:45,824 --> 01:03:49,619
But the hardest part
is explaining to your little boy.

511
01:03:49,744 --> 01:03:51,788
I do the best I can.

512
01:03:53,331 --> 01:03:57,210
There's something deeper down,
hard to get a grip on.

513
01:03:58,670 --> 01:04:02,298
You love someone -
or rather, you say you do.

514
01:04:03,216 --> 01:04:07,095
It's something tangible -
at least, as far as words can be.

515
01:04:08,513 --> 01:04:12,017
Mr. Vogler,
I'm not your wife.

516
01:04:12,183 --> 01:04:14,394
And you're loved as well.

517
01:04:14,519 --> 01:04:16,521
You build a community.

518
01:04:17,063 --> 01:04:19,149
It gives you security.

519
01:04:19,524 --> 01:04:22,152
You see a possible way
of enduring, don't you?

520
01:04:25,238 --> 01:04:29,367
How can I say everything
I've thought without getting lost...

521
01:04:29,701 --> 01:04:31,870
without boring you?

522
01:04:39,711 --> 01:04:43,381
I love you
as much as ever.

523
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:53,266
No, don't worry, my love.

524
01:04:53,767 --> 01:04:57,062
We have each other.
We have faith in each other.

525
01:04:57,187 --> 01:05:00,273
We know each other's thoughts.
We love each other.

526
01:05:00,398 --> 01:05:02,484
That's true, isn't it?
- Yes.

527
01:05:02,859 --> 01:05:06,863
And it's the effort that counts,
not what we achieve, right?

528
01:05:09,491 --> 01:05:11,326
To see each other
as children,

529
01:05:11,451 --> 01:05:14,162
tormented, helpless,
lonely children.

530
01:05:16,706 --> 01:05:20,335
Tell our little boy
Mommy will be back soon,

531
01:05:20,877 --> 01:05:24,547
that Mommy's been ill,
but she longs for her little boy.

532
01:05:24,798 --> 01:05:27,759
Remember to buy
a toy for him.

533
01:05:27,926 --> 01:05:30,345
A present from Mommy.
Don't forget.

534
01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:32,847
I feel such great
tenderness for you.

535
01:05:36,768 --> 01:05:38,937
It's almost unbearable.

536
01:05:40,355 --> 01:05:43,191
I don't know what to do
with my tenderness.

537
01:05:45,068 --> 01:05:47,654
I thrive on your tenderness.

538
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:52,492
Elisabet, is it good
for you with me?

539
01:05:53,076 --> 01:05:55,078
Is it good for you?

540
01:05:57,288 --> 01:06:00,583
You're a wonderful lover.
You know that.

541
01:06:00,708 --> 01:06:02,293
Darling!

542
01:06:04,129 --> 01:06:06,214
Give me a sedative.

543
01:06:06,339 --> 01:06:09,634
Toss me aside.
I can't go on!

544
01:06:09,801 --> 01:06:11,052
My darling...

545
01:06:11,177 --> 01:06:12,595
Leave me alone!

546
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,889
This is shameful, all of it!

547
01:06:15,473 --> 01:06:17,142
Leave me alone!

548
01:06:17,308 --> 01:06:19,936
I'm cold and rotten
and indifferent.

549
01:06:20,854 --> 01:06:23,648
It's all just a sham and lies!

550
01:06:33,199 --> 01:06:34,868
What have you got there?

551
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:38,163
What are you hiding
under your hand?

552
01:06:38,329 --> 01:06:39,914
Let me see.

553
01:06:43,168 --> 01:06:47,505
It's the picture of your little boy,
the one you tore up.

554
01:06:47,630 --> 01:06:49,716
We have to talk about this.

555
01:06:57,682 --> 01:06:59,851
Tell me now, Elisabet.

556
01:07:01,102 --> 01:07:02,979
Then I Will.

557
01:07:04,272 --> 01:07:07,317
It happened at a party one night,
didn't it?

558
01:07:07,859 --> 01:07:10,445
It was late, and the party
was quite rowdy.

559
01:07:11,613 --> 01:07:14,782
Toward morning someone
in the group said to you...

560
01:07:15,450 --> 01:07:17,911
“Elisabet, you have
practically everything

561
01:07:18,036 --> 01:07:20,038
as a woman
and as an artist,

562
01:07:20,205 --> 01:07:22,498
but you lack motherliness.”

563
01:07:24,375 --> 01:07:27,378
You laughed,
thinking it was ridiculous,

564
01:07:28,087 --> 01:07:32,091
but later you found yourself
thinking about what he'd said.

565
01:07:33,885 --> 01:07:36,179
You grew
more and more worried...

566
01:07:37,013 --> 01:07:39,766
so you let your husband
get you pregnant.

567
01:07:39,891 --> 01:07:42,060
You wanted
to be a mother.

568
01:07:43,394 --> 01:07:46,898
When you knew it was definite,
you became afraid...

569
01:07:47,023 --> 01:07:50,026
afraid of responsibility,
of being tied down,

570
01:07:50,151 --> 01:07:52,528
of leaving
the theater behind,

571
01:07:53,154 --> 01:07:55,782
afraid of pain,
afraid of dying,

572
01:07:56,032 --> 01:07:58,660
afraid of your body
that was swelling up.

573
01:07:59,869 --> 01:08:02,372
But you played
the part the whole time,

574
01:08:02,497 --> 01:08:06,042
the part of the young,
happy, expectant mother.

575
01:08:07,126 --> 01:08:09,462
Everyone said,
“lsn't she beautiful now?

576
01:08:09,587 --> 01:08:11,923
She's never been
so beautiful.”

577
01:08:14,759 --> 01:08:18,179
Meanwhile you tried
several times to abort.

578
01:08:19,722 --> 01:08:21,599
But you failed.

579
01:08:22,392 --> 01:08:24,602
When you realized
it was inevitable,

580
01:08:24,727 --> 01:08:27,021
you began
to hate the baby

581
01:08:27,146 --> 01:08:29,857
and hoped
it would be stillborn.

582
01:08:33,236 --> 01:08:36,197
You hoped
the baby would be dead.

583
01:08:38,408 --> 01:08:41,119
You wanted a dead baby.

584
01:08:45,957 --> 01:08:48,835
It was a long
and difficult delivery.

585
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:51,129
You were in agony
for days.

586
01:08:52,505 --> 01:08:55,049
The baby was finally
delivered with forceps.

587
01:08:55,174 --> 01:08:59,470
You looked with disgust at your
squealing child and whispered,

588
01:08:59,595 --> 01:09:02,348
“Can't you just die?
Can't you die?”

589
01:09:04,809 --> 01:09:06,728
But he survived.

590
01:09:08,313 --> 01:09:10,982
The boy cried
day and night...

591
01:09:14,027 --> 01:09:16,070
and you hated him.

592
01:09:16,904 --> 01:09:20,408
You were afraid.
You had a guilty conscience.

593
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:24,996
In the end,
some relatives and a nanny

594
01:09:25,121 --> 01:09:27,165
took care of the boy,

595
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:31,294
and you could leave your sickbed
and return to the theater.

596
01:09:34,130 --> 01:09:36,507
But the suffering wasn't over.

597
01:09:37,633 --> 01:09:39,677
The boy was seized

598
01:09:39,844 --> 01:09:42,597
by a vast, unfathomable love
for his mother.

599
01:09:42,972 --> 01:09:44,932
You resist.

600
01:09:45,058 --> 01:09:47,393
You resist desperately,

601
01:09:47,769 --> 01:09:50,646
because you feel
you can't return that love.

602
01:09:50,772 --> 01:09:53,149
You try and try...

603
01:09:54,359 --> 01:09:58,154
but your encounters with him
are cruel and awkward.

604
01:09:58,279 --> 01:10:00,031
You can't do it.

605
01:10:00,156 --> 01:10:02,200
You're cold and indifferent.

606
01:10:03,242 --> 01:10:05,370
And he looks at you.

607
01:10:05,536 --> 01:10:08,456
He loves you,
and he's so soft,

608
01:10:08,581 --> 01:10:12,043
and you want to hit him
for not leaving you alone.

609
01:10:13,127 --> 01:10:17,131
You find him repulsive,
with his thick lips and ugly body

610
01:10:17,256 --> 01:10:19,884
and his moist, pleading eyes.

611
01:10:20,009 --> 01:10:22,553
You find him repulsive,
and you're afraid.

612
01:10:23,763 --> 01:10:25,807
What have you got there?

613
01:10:26,182 --> 01:10:28,726
What are you hiding
under your hand?

614
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:30,603
Let me see.

615
01:10:34,982 --> 01:10:38,736
It's the picture of your little boy,
the one you tore up.

616
01:10:38,986 --> 01:10:41,197
We have to talk about this.

617
01:10:49,872 --> 01:10:52,166
Tell me now, Elisabet.

618
01:10:55,086 --> 01:10:57,004
Then I Will.

619
01:10:59,757 --> 01:11:02,510
It happened at a party one night,
didn't it?

620
01:11:03,344 --> 01:11:05,680
It was late, and the party
was quite rowdy.

621
01:11:07,515 --> 01:11:10,852
Toward morning someone

622
01:11:11,394 --> 01:11:14,063
“Elisabet, you have

623
01:11:14,188 --> 01:11:16,315
as a woman
and as an artist,

624
01:11:16,524 --> 01:11:18,943
but you lack motherliness.”

625
01:11:20,736 --> 01:11:24,031
You laughed,
thinking it was ridiculous,

626
01:11:25,116 --> 01:11:29,120
but later you found yourself
thinking about what he'd said.

627
01:11:29,454 --> 01:11:31,789
You grew

628
01:11:32,582 --> 01:11:35,334
so you let your husband
get you pregnant.

629
01:11:37,086 --> 01:11:39,255
You wanted
to be a mother.

630
01:11:41,716 --> 01:11:45,219
When you knew it was definite,
you became afraid...

631
01:11:46,137 --> 01:11:49,891
afraid of responsibility,
of being tied down,

632
01:11:50,016 --> 01:11:52,310
of leaving
the theater behind,

633
01:11:53,019 --> 01:11:55,563
afraid of pain,
afraid of dying,

634
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:58,691
afraid of your body
that was swelling up.

635
01:12:01,027 --> 01:12:03,488
But you played
the part the whole time,

636
01:12:03,613 --> 01:12:06,991
the part of the young,
happy, expectant mother.

637
01:12:08,326 --> 01:12:10,536
Everyone said,
“lsn't she beautiful now?

638
01:12:10,661 --> 01:12:12,663
She's never been
so beautiful.”

639
01:12:14,248 --> 01:12:17,752
Meanwhile you tried
several times to abort.

640
01:12:18,628 --> 01:12:20,588
But you failed.

641
01:12:22,215 --> 01:12:24,675
When you realized
it was inevitable...

642
01:12:26,302 --> 01:12:28,721
you began
to hate the baby...

643
01:12:30,681 --> 01:12:33,434
and hoped
it would be stillborn.

644
01:12:36,812 --> 01:12:39,815
You hoped
the baby would be dead.

645
01:12:44,028 --> 01:12:46,656
You wanted a dead baby.

646
01:12:50,952 --> 01:12:53,829
It was a long
and difficult delivery.

647
01:12:54,497 --> 01:12:56,749
You were in agony
for days.

648
01:12:58,042 --> 01:13:00,711
The baby was finally
delivered with forceps.

649
01:13:01,379 --> 01:13:05,675
You looked with disgust at your
squealing child and whispered,

650
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,927
“Can't you just die?

651
01:13:08,052 --> 01:13:09,887
Can't you die?”

652
01:13:10,555 --> 01:13:13,182
The boy cried
day and night,

653
01:13:13,307 --> 01:13:15,393
and you hated him.

654
01:13:16,102 --> 01:13:19,564
You were afraid.
You had a guilty conscience.

655
01:13:21,732 --> 01:13:24,068
In the end,
some relatives and a nanny

656
01:13:24,193 --> 01:13:26,195
took care of the boy,

657
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:30,241
and you could leave your sickbed
and return to the theater.

658
01:13:32,285 --> 01:13:34,161
But the suffering wasn't over.

659
01:13:36,622 --> 01:13:38,666
The boy was seized

660
01:13:38,791 --> 01:13:41,711
by a vast, unfathomable love
for his mother.

661
01:13:42,211 --> 01:13:45,006
You resist desperately,

662
01:13:45,131 --> 01:13:48,342
because you feel
you can't return that love.

663
01:13:48,467 --> 01:13:50,761
You try and try...

664
01:13:51,804 --> 01:13:55,474
but your encounters with him
are cruel and awkward.

665
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,435
You can't do it.

666
01:13:58,102 --> 01:14:00,563
You're cold and indifferent.

667
01:14:01,439 --> 01:14:03,524
And he looks at you.

668
01:14:03,774 --> 01:14:06,611
He loves you,
and he's so soft,

669
01:14:06,861 --> 01:14:10,448
and you want to hit him
for not leaving you alone.

670
01:14:11,324 --> 01:14:15,286
You find him repulsive,
with his thick lips and ugly body

671
01:14:15,453 --> 01:14:18,039
and his moist, pleading eyes.

672
01:14:18,164 --> 01:14:20,750
You find him repulsive,
and you're afraid.

673
01:14:28,841 --> 01:14:30,343
No!

674
01:14:31,802 --> 01:14:33,804
I'm not like you.

675
01:14:34,138 --> 01:14:36,474
I don't feel
the same way you do.

676
01:14:37,099 --> 01:14:40,603
I'm Sister Alma.
I'm only here to help you.

677
01:14:40,895 --> 01:14:42,938
I'm not Elisabet Vogler.

678
01:14:43,064 --> 01:14:45,232
You're Elisabet Vogler.

679
01:14:45,650 --> 01:14:47,777
I'd really like to have...

680
01:14:49,070 --> 01:14:50,988
I love...

681
01:14:53,324 --> 01:14:54,825
I haven't...

682
01:15:29,026 --> 01:15:31,112
I've learned quite a lot.

683
01:15:45,835 --> 01:15:48,212
Let's see how long
I can hold out.

684
01:15:54,343 --> 01:15:58,222
<i>I'll</i> never be like you.
I change all the time.

685
01:15:58,347 --> 01:16:01,225
You can do what you want.
You won't get to me.

686
01:16:35,468 --> 01:16:37,261
Say nothing.

687
01:16:38,387 --> 01:16:40,264
Cut a candle.

688
01:16:40,389 --> 01:16:42,349
A kind of otherness.

689
01:16:42,558 --> 01:16:45,102
Not now. No, no.

690
01:16:46,479 --> 01:16:49,148
Warning and outside time.

691
01:16:49,273 --> 01:16:50,816
Unforeseen.

692
01:16:50,941 --> 01:16:54,779
When it was supposed to happen,
it didn't, so... failure.

693
01:16:54,945 --> 01:16:56,864
You stand there,

694
01:16:56,989 --> 01:16:58,949
but I should do it.

695
01:16:59,116 --> 01:17:00,993
Not inward, no.

696
01:17:01,118 --> 01:17:03,370
Say collect
and advise others.

697
01:17:03,496 --> 01:17:05,831
A desperate maybe.

698
01:17:11,045 --> 01:17:14,799
I take, yes“.
But what is closest?

699
01:17:15,508 --> 01:17:17,551
What's it called?

700
01:17:17,676 --> 01:17:19,303
No, no, no.

701
01:17:19,762 --> 01:17:22,681
Us, we, me, I.

702
01:17:22,807 --> 01:17:25,267
Many words
and then disgust,

703
01:17:25,392 --> 01:17:28,854
unbearable pain,
the nausea.

704
01:19:00,905 --> 01:19:03,240
Try and listen to me now.

705
01:19:03,949 --> 01:19:06,243
Repeat after me.

706
01:19:10,623 --> 01:19:12,207
Nothing.

707
01:19:15,753 --> 01:19:17,254
Nothing.

708
01:19:18,631 --> 01:19:20,466
No, nothing.

709
01:19:27,431 --> 01:19:28,933
Nothing.

710
01:19:30,434 --> 01:19:32,019
That's it.

711
01:19:32,394 --> 01:19:34,104
That's good.

712
01:19:34,229 --> 01:19:36,273
That's how it should be.

713
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:56,533
