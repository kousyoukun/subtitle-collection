1
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:24,777
You wished
to speak to me, Doctor?

2
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,363
Have you seen Mrs. Vogler yet,
Sister Alma?

3
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:28,489
No, not yet.

4
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:30,700
Let me explain her situation

5
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:34,454
and why you've been
hired to care for her.

6
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:37,915
Mrs. Vogler is an actress,
as you know.

7
00:07:38,042 --> 00:07:41,419
In the middle of her last
performance of Electra,

8
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:46,132
she fell silent and looked
around as if in surprise.

9
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:48,885
She was silent
for over a minute.

10
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:04,317
She apologized
to her colleagues afterward,

11
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:07,153
saying she'd felt
a sudden urge to laugh.

12
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:09,656
The next day
the theater called

13
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,575
to ask if she'd forgotten
about rehearsal.

14
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:16,329
The maid went in her room
and found her still in bed.

15
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:19,749
She was awake but wouldn't
answer questions or move.

16
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,753
This condition's gone on
for three months now.

17
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,631
She's been given
every conceivable test.

18
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:28,841
The result is clear:

19
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:32,470
She's perfectly healthy,
both mentally and physically.

20
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:36,307
And it's not a question
of some hysterical reaction either.

21
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,893
Any questions,
Sister Alma?

22
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:43,106
If not, you can go
see Mrs. Vogler now.

23
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:53,199
Hello, Mrs. Vogler.

24
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:56,661
I'm Sister Alma.

25
00:08:56,787 --> 00:09:00,289
I've been hired to take care
of you for a while.

26
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,461
Perhaps I should tell you
a bit about myself.

27
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:08,214
I'm 25 years old,
and I'm engaged.

28
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:11,676
I got my nursing certificate
two years ago.

29
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:15,054
My parents have
a farm in the country.

30
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:19,434
My mother was a nurse too,
before she got married.

31
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:24,897
I should go get your dinner tray...
fried liver and fruit salad.

32
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:27,150
It looked quite good.

33
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:31,821
Shall I raise this end up?
Are you all right like that?

34
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:42,039
Sister Alma,
what's your first impression?

35
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,668
I don't know
what to say, Doctor.

36
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,505
At first her face looks soft,
almost childish,

37
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,966
but then
you see her eyes...

38
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,927
Her expression's so hard.

39
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,805
Perhaps I shouldn't...

40
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,099
What were you going to say?

41
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,935
I was thinking I should
turn down the assignment.

42
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,605
Why? Did something
frighten you?

43
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:07,857
No, not exactly,

44
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:11,694
but perhaps Mrs. Vogler
should have an older nurse,

45
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,863
one with more life experience.

46
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:17,283
I might not be able to manage.
- Manage? In what way?

47
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,619
- Mentally.
- Mentally?

48
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:24,081
If she's made a conscious
decision not to speak or move,

49
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,626
which must be the case,
since she's healthy...

50
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:28,377
Then?

51
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:31,714
Then that shows
great mental strength.

52
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,841
I may not be up to it.

53
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:38,513
I thought you might want
to see the twilight.

54
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,681
I can draw
the curtains later.

55
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:45,686
Shall I turn on the radio?

56
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:48,189
I think there's a play on.

57
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:52,652
Forgive me, darling.

58
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,947
You must forgive me.

59
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:59,867
All I want
is your forgiveness.

60
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:05,498
What are you laughing about?
ls the actress so funny?

61
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:10,253
What do you know
of mercy? Well?

62
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:14,257
What do you know
of mercy?

63
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:22,139
I don't understand
those sorts of things.

64
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:25,101
I enjoy films
and the theater,

65
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:27,854
but I'm afraid
I don't go very often.

66
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:31,023
I have tremendous
admiration for artists.

67
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:35,778
I think art is enormously
important in life,

68
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:40,032
especially for those struggling
for one reason or another.

69
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:46,122
But I'm skating on thin ice,
telling you about such things.

70
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,791
Let's see
if I can find some music.

71
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:51,878
Is that all right?

72
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:56,966
Good night, then.
Sleep well.

73
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:50,079
Damn it.

74
00:13:58,005 --> 00:13:59,714
It's funny.

75
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:02,967
You can go about
as you please...

76
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:06,053
doing almost anything
you please.

77
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:12,643
I'll marry Karl-Henrik
and we'll have a couple kids,

78
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,812
whom I'll raise.

79
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,858
It's all decided.
It's inside me.

80
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:22,236
I don't even have
to think about it.

81
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,614
It's a great feeling
of security.

82
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:29,910
I have a job
I like and enjoy.

83
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,913
That's good too...

84
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:35,750
but in another way.

85
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:38,377
But it's good.

86
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,379
Yes...

87
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:43,883
it's good.

88
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,477
I wonder what's really
wrong with her.

89
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,398
Elisabet Vogler.

90
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:43,502
Mrs. Vogler, would you like me
to open the letter?

91
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:52,428
Shall I read it?

92
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,436
Shall I read it to you?

93
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,738
"Dearest Elisabet,

94
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:14,700
since I'm not allowed
to see you, I'm writing instead.

95
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:18,662
If you don't wish to read
my letter, you can ignore it.

96
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:25,211
But I can't help trying
to contact you this way,

97
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,714
as I'm tormented
by a persistent question:

98
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:31,550
Have I done you harm
in some way?

99
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:34,637
Have I unknowingly
hurt you somehow?

100
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:39,558
Was there some terrible
misunderstanding between us?"

101
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,150
Should I really go on?

102
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:59,745
"As far as I know,
we've been happy recently.

103
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:01,872
Surely we've never been...

104
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,416
so close.

105
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:08,587
Do you remember saying,

106
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,173
'I'm only just beginning
to understand

107
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,550
what it means
to be married'?

108
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:15,678
'You've taught me..."'

109
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:18,430
I can't make it out.

110
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:22,101
"'You've taught..." '
Now I see.

111
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:25,980
"'You've taught me
that we must see each other

112
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:29,024
as two anxious children

113
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:33,153
full of goodwill
and the best of intentions

114
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:37,574
but gov... "'
Now I see.

115
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:42,121
"'...governed by forces
we can only partially control.'

116
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:45,457
Do you remember
saying all that?

117
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:49,295
We were walking
in the woods,

118
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:52,339
and you stopped and grabbed
the belt of my coat..."

119
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:03,475
There was a picture
with the letter.

120
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:07,980
A picture of your son.
I don't know if...

121
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,025
Do you want it,
Mrs. Vogler?

122
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:15,195
He looks awfully cute.

123
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:50,397
Elisabet, I don't think
there's any point

124
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,941
in your staying here
in the hospital.

125
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:55,235
It's just hurting you
to be here.

126
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,529
Since you don't want
to go home,

127
00:19:57,655 --> 00:19:59,823
I suggest you
and Sister Alma move out

128
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:02,034
to my summer place
by the sea.

129
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:06,538
You think
I don't understand?

130
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,833
The hopeless dream
of being.

131
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,252
Not seeming to be,
but being.

132
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:18,300
Conscious and awake
at every moment.

133
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:22,721
At the same time, the chasm
between what you are to others

134
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:24,932
and what you are
to yourself.

135
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:28,310
The feeling of vertigo,
and the constant hunger

136
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:31,063
to be unmasked
once and for all.

137
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:35,234
To be seen through,
cut down...

138
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:38,237
perhaps even annihilated.

139
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:43,200
Every tone of voice a lie,
every gesture a falsehood,

140
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:45,369
every smile a grimace.

141
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:48,664
Commit suicide?

142
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:51,917
No, too nasty.

143
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,087
One doesn't do
things like that.

144
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:58,590
But you can refuse
to move or talk.

145
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:00,968
Then at least
you're not lying.

146
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:04,513
You can cut yourself off,
close yourself in.

147
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,849
Then you needn't
play any roles,

148
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:09,893
wear any masks,
make any false gestures.

149
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,020
So you might think...

150
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:14,940
but reality plays
nasty tricks on you.

151
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:18,277
Your hiding place
isn't watertight enough.

152
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:21,280
Life oozes in from all sides.

153
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:26,702
You're forced to react.

154
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:31,039
No one asks
whether it's genuine or not,

155
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,876
whether you're lying
or telling the truth.

156
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:37,087
Questions like that
only matter in the theater,

157
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:39,256
and hardly even there.

158
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,634
I understand you,
Elisabet.

159
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,888
I understand that you're
not speaking or moving,

160
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:50,476
that you've turned this apathy
into a fantastic setup.

161
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:53,812
I understand
and admire you.

162
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:59,151
I think you should play this part
until it's played out,

163
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:02,237
until it's no longer
interesting.

164
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:05,991
Then you can drop it,
just as you eventually drop

165
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,952
all your other roles.

166
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:16,293
Thus, at the end of the summer,
Mrs. Vogler and Sister Alma

167
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:18,837
move out to the doctor's
summer house.

168
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:23,050
The stay by the sea agrees
very well with the actress.

169
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:26,053
Her crippling apathy
at the hospital

170
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:29,056
gives way to long walks,
fishing excursions,

171
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:32,267
cooking, letter writing,
and other diversions.

172
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:36,021
Sister Alma enjoys
the seclusion of the countryside

173
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:39,191
and tends to her patient
with utmost care.

174
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:24,570
Don't you know it's bad luck
to compare hands?

175
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:45,048
Elisabet...

176
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:47,634
may I read you
something from my book?

177
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,720
Or am I disturbing you?

178
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:51,555
Here's what it says:

179
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:54,391
"All the anxiety
we carry within us,

180
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:58,770
all our thwarted dreams,
the inexplicable cruelty,

181
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:01,106
our fear of extinction,

182
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:04,318
the painful insight
into our earthly condition

183
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:10,449
have slowly crystallized our hope
for an other-worldly salvation.

184
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:13,785
The tremendous cry
of our faith and doubt

185
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:16,079
against the darkness
and silence

186
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:20,042
is the most terrifying proof
of our abandonment

187
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:23,295
and our unuttered knowledge."

188
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,633
Do you think that's true?

189
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:33,805
I don't believe that.

190
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:38,644
To change...
but I'm so lazy.

191
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:41,396
And then
I feel guilty about it.

192
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:43,899
Karl-Henrik scolds me
for not having any ambition,

193
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:46,234
for going around
like I'm sleepwalking.

194
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:48,195
I think that's unfair.

195
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,864
I graduated highest
in my class.

196
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,241
But maybe he means
something else.

197
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:58,455
You know...
Oh, sorry.

198
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:01,333
You know what
I think about sometimes?

199
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:04,378
At the hospital
where I took my exam,

200
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:06,672
there's a home
for old nurses

201
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:10,300
who were nurses all their lives
and lived for their work

202
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,761
and were always
in uniform.

203
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:14,971
They live
in their little rooms there.

204
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:17,974
Imagine believing
so strongly in something

205
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:20,018
that you devote
your entire life to it.

206
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:23,105
Having something to believe in,
working at something,

207
00:25:23,231 --> 00:25:26,024
believing
your life has meaning.

208
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:27,901
I like that.

209
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:31,530
Holding on tight to something,
no matter what...

210
00:25:31,656 --> 00:25:33,573
I think that's how
it should be.

211
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,535
Meaning something
to other people.

212
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:38,787
Don't you agree?

213
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:46,336
I know it sounds childish,
but I believe in that.

214
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,215
What a downpour!

215
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:54,428
Oh, yes, he was married.

216
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:57,097
We had an affair
for five years.

217
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:59,808
Then he got tired of it,
of course.

218
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:03,854
I was terribly in love,
and he was the first.

219
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:07,441
I remember it all
like one long torment.

220
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:12,279
Long periods of agony,
and brief moments when...

221
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:16,825
Your teaching me
how to smoke reminded me.

222
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:18,952
He smoked constantly.

223
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,038
In hindsight
it all seems so dreary.

224
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:24,416
A real dime store novel.

225
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:29,755
In some strange way
it was never quite real.

226
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,425
I don't know how
to explain it.

227
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:36,762
At least, I was never
quite real to him.

228
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,974
But my pain was real,
that's for sure.

229
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,604
But that was somehow
all a part of it

230
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,814
in some nasty way,

231
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,692
as if that's how
it was supposed to be.

232
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:54,237
Even the things
we said to each other.

233
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,498
Lots of people have told me
I'm a good listener.

234
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:06,458
Isn't that funny?

235
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:09,377
No one's ever bothered
to listen to me.

236
00:27:09,504 --> 00:27:12,464
Like you're doing now.
You're really listening.

237
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:16,468
I think you're the first person
who's ever listened to me.

238
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:18,804
It can't be at all interesting.

239
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:21,264
You could be reading
a good book instead.

240
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,975
How I'm going on!
I hope I'm not irritating you.

241
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,438
It feels so good to talk.
It feels nice and warm.

242
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:31,900
I've never felt like this
in all my life.

243
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,154
I've always wanted
a sister.

244
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,865
I have loads of brothers...
seven.

245
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,076
Strange, eh?
Then I came along.

246
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:44,704
I remember being surrounded
by boys all my life.

247
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:47,499
But I like boys.

248
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:49,835
But I'm sure
you know that,

249
00:27:49,961 --> 00:27:52,879
with all your experience
as an actress.

250
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:56,091
I like Karl-Henrik so much,

251
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:59,678
but you really
only love once.

252
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:01,847
I'm faithful to him.

253
00:28:01,973 --> 00:28:05,976
Opportunities come up
in this line of work, I can tell you.

254
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:12,566
Karl-Henrik and I rented
a cottage by the sea once.

255
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,069
It was June,
and we were all alone.

256
00:28:17,572 --> 00:28:19,990
One day, when Karl-Henrik
had gone into town,

257
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:22,325
I went to the beach
on my own.

258
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:25,328
It was a warm
and lovely day.

259
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:29,666
There was
another girl there.

260
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:32,752
She'd paddled over
from another island

261
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:36,548
because our beach
was sunnier and more secluded.

262
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:41,720
We lay there sunbathing beside
one another, completely naked,

263
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:45,932
dozing now and then,
putting suntan lotion on.

264
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:51,479
We had those cheap
straw hats on, you know?

265
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:55,650
I had a blue ribbon
around mine.

266
00:28:58,112 --> 00:29:01,281
I lay there peeping out
from under my hat

267
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:05,577
at the landscape
and the sea and the sun.

268
00:29:05,912 --> 00:29:07,954
It was kind of funny.

269
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:17,881
Suddenly I saw two figures leaping
about on the rocks above us.

270
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:22,677
They would hide
and then peek out.

271
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:26,806
"There's a couple boys
looking at us," I told the girl.

272
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:28,934
Her name was Katarina.

273
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:33,939
"Let them look," she said,
and turned over on her back.

274
00:29:35,358 --> 00:29:37,943
It was a strange feeling.

275
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:41,404
I wanted to jump up
and put on my robe,

276
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,949
but I just lay there
on my stomach

277
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:46,242
with my bottom in the air,

278
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:49,788
not at all embarrassed,
completely calm.

279
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:55,377
Katarina lay there
next to me the whole time,

280
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:58,505
with her breasts
and thick thighs.

281
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:02,467
She just lay there
sort of giggling to herself.

282
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:07,681
I noticed that the boys
had come closer.

283
00:30:07,807 --> 00:30:10,892
They just stood there
looking at us.

284
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:14,688
I noticed
they were terribly young.

285
00:30:16,065 --> 00:30:19,985
Then one of them...
the more daring of the two...

286
00:30:20,778 --> 00:30:24,614
came up and squatted down
next to Katarina.

287
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:29,953
He pretended to be busy
picking at his toes.

288
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:34,874
I felt so strange.

289
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:39,838
Suddenly
I heard Katarina say,

290
00:30:40,381 --> 00:30:43,758
"Hey, why don't you
come over here?"

291
00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:46,678
She took him by the hand

292
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:49,264
and helped him off
with his jeans and shirt.

293
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,683
Then suddenly
he was on top of her.

294
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:55,979
She guided him in
with her hands on his behind.

295
00:30:57,565 --> 00:31:00,692
The other boy just sat
on the slope and watched.

296
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:05,697
I heard Katarina whisper
in the boy's ear and laugh.

297
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:09,868
His face was
right next to mine.

298
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:13,455
It was red and swollen.

299
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:18,501
Suddenly
I turned over and said,

300
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:21,254
"Aren't you coming
over to me too?"

301
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:24,966
And Katarina said,
"Go to her now."

302
00:31:25,134 --> 00:31:27,302
He pulled out of her

303
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,597
and fell on top of me,
completely hard.

304
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:32,766
He grabbed my breast.

305
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:34,893
It hurt so bad!

306
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:39,564
I was ready somehow
and came almost at once.

307
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,566
Can you believe it?

308
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:46,863
I was about to say,
"Careful you don't get me pregnant"

309
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:49,199
when he suddenly came.

310
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,869
I felt it like
never before in my life,

311
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:56,247
the way he sprayed
his seed into me.

312
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:59,793
He gripped my shoulders
and arched backward.

313
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,253
I came over and over.

314
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:08,051
Katarina lay on her side
and watched

315
00:32:08,177 --> 00:32:10,720
and held him from behind.

316
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:16,309
After he came,
she took him in her arms

317
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:19,062
and used his hand
to make herself come.

318
00:32:19,814 --> 00:32:21,439
When she came,

319
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:23,817
she screamed
like a banshee.

320
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:32,867
Then all three of us
started laughing.

321
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:36,663
We called to the other boy,
who was sitting on the slope.

322
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:38,790
His name was Peter.

323
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:45,130
He came down,
looking all confused

324
00:32:45,256 --> 00:32:47,549
and shivering
despite the sunshine.

325
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:54,013
Katarina unbuttoned his pants
and started to play with him.

326
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:58,476
And when he came,
she took him in her mouth.

327
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:02,480
He bent down
and kissed her back.

328
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:06,067
She turned around,
took his head in both hands,

329
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:07,902
and gave him her breast.

330
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:12,031
The other boy got so excited
that he and I started all over again.

331
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:15,326
It was just as good
as before.

332
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:20,957
Then we went for a swim
and parted ways.

333
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:24,919
When I got home, Karl-Henrik
was already back from town.

334
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:31,342
We ate dinner and drank
some red wine he'd brought.

335
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:35,763
Then we had sex.

336
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:40,268
It's never been as good,
before or since.

337
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,020
Can you understand that?

338
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:45,607
I ended up pregnant,
of course.

339
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:49,194
Karl-Henrik,
who's studying medicine,

340
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:53,364
took me to a good friend of his,
who performed an abortion.

341
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:57,535
We were both relieved.
We didn't want children.

342
00:33:57,912 --> 00:34:00,205
Not then, anyway.

343
00:34:06,629 --> 00:34:09,047
It doesn't make any sense.

344
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:12,300
Nothing fits together.

345
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,429
And the guilty conscience
you feel over little things.

346
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,556
You understand?

347
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:21,976
And what about all the things
you'd decided to do?

348
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:24,896
Don't you have
to do them anymore?

349
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,524
Is it possible to be

350
00:34:28,651 --> 00:34:31,653
one and the same person
at the very same time...

351
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:33,821
I mean, two people?

352
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:36,115
God, I'm being silly!

353
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:39,744
Anyway, there's no reason
to start blubbering.

354
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:43,081
I'll get a handkerchief.

355
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,521
It's almost morning...

356
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:09,899
and it's still raining.

357
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:19,242
I've been talking nonstop

358
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:21,452
while you've just listened.

359
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:23,371
How boring for you.

360
00:35:23,497 --> 00:35:26,499
What could possibly
interest you about my life?

361
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:29,460
People should be like you.

362
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:33,006
You know what I thought

363
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:35,800
after I saw a film
of yours one night?

364
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:38,803
When I got home and looked
in the mirror, I thought,

365
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:40,930
"We look alike."

366
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:44,350
Don't get me wrong.
You're much more beautiful.

367
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,477
But we're alike somehow.

368
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:50,898
I think I could turn into you
if I really tried.

369
00:35:51,317 --> 00:35:53,318
I mean inside.

370
00:35:55,154 --> 00:35:58,323
You could be me
just like that...

371
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,076
though your soul
would be far too big.

372
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:04,662
It would stick out
everywhere!

373
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:10,168
Go to bed...

374
00:36:10,294 --> 00:36:13,004
or you'll fall asleep
here at the table.

375
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:29,062
I must go to bed now

376
00:36:29,313 --> 00:36:31,522
or I'll fall asleep
at the table,

377
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,067
and that would be
rather uncomfortable.

378
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:39,364
Good night.

379
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:41,546
Elisabet...

380
00:39:44,258 --> 00:39:46,717
did you speak to me
last night?

381
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:20,751
Were you
in my room last night?

382
00:41:03,337 --> 00:41:05,671
Shall I take your mail too?

383
00:41:07,007 --> 00:41:08,883
Let me have a taste.

384
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:12,261
See ya.

385
00:42:19,121 --> 00:42:22,081
"Dear friend,
I could live like this forever.

386
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:25,167
The silence, the seclusion,
reducing my needs,

387
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:29,213
feeling my battered soul finally
start to straighten itself out.

388
00:42:34,553 --> 00:42:37,888
Alma pampers me
in the most touching way.

389
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:43,894
I think she's actually enjoying it here
and that she's very fond of me,

390
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:47,982
perhaps even a bit smitten
in a charming, subconscious way.

391
00:42:48,108 --> 00:42:51,736
In any case,
it's a lot of fun studying her.

392
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:03,998
Sometimes she cries
over past sins...

393
00:43:04,124 --> 00:43:07,209
an orgy with a strange boy
and a subsequent abortion.

394
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:10,129
She complains
that her notions about life

395
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:13,007
fail to accord with her actions."

396
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:59,603
I see
you're reading a play.

397
00:49:00,063 --> 00:49:03,398
That's a healthy sign.
I'll tell the doctor.

398
00:49:06,736 --> 00:49:08,821
You think we should
leave here soon?

399
00:49:08,947 --> 00:49:11,156
I'm starting
to miss the city.

400
00:49:11,658 --> 00:49:13,367
Aren't you?

401
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:32,094
Would you like
to make me really happy?

402
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:36,974
I know it's asking a lot,
but I could use your help right now.

403
00:49:37,517 --> 00:49:39,101
Nothing dangerous.

404
00:49:39,227 --> 00:49:41,979
But I do wish
you'd talk to me.

405
00:49:42,105 --> 00:49:44,314
Doesn't have to be
anything special.

406
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:47,985
We could talk about anything...
what to have for dinner,

407
00:49:48,111 --> 00:49:50,737
whether the water's
cold now after the storm,

408
00:49:50,864 --> 00:49:53,323
whether it's too cold
to go swimming.

409
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:56,577
Just talk for a few minutes.
One minute.

410
00:49:56,703 --> 00:49:58,996
You could read to me
from your book.

411
00:49:59,164 --> 00:50:00,581
Just say a few words.

412
00:50:03,543 --> 00:50:05,669
I have to try
not to get angry.

413
00:50:05,837 --> 00:50:07,963
It's your business
if you want to keep quiet.

414
00:50:08,089 --> 00:50:11,091
But I need you
to talk to me now.

415
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,554
Can't you just say

416
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,222
one word?

417
00:50:19,851 --> 00:50:21,935
I knew you'd refuse.

418
00:50:23,146 --> 00:50:25,355
You can't know how I feel.

419
00:50:26,983 --> 00:50:29,359
I always thought great artists

420
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:32,446
felt this great compassion
for other people...

421
00:50:33,156 --> 00:50:35,908
that they created
out of great compassion

422
00:50:36,034 --> 00:50:38,035
and a need to help.

423
00:50:38,203 --> 00:50:40,204
That was silly of me.

424
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:46,752
You've used me.
For what, I don't know.

425
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:50,380
Now that you don't need me
anymore, you toss me aside.

426
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:54,218
Yes, I hear perfectly well
how phony that sounds!

427
00:50:54,344 --> 00:50:56,803
"You've used me, and now
you're tossing me aside."

428
00:50:56,930 --> 00:51:00,057
But it's true... every word.
And these glasses!

429
00:51:09,067 --> 00:51:11,068
You've hurt me badly.

430
00:51:11,861 --> 00:51:14,529
You've been laughing at me
behind my back.

431
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:18,867
I read the letter
you wrote to the doctor.

432
00:51:18,993 --> 00:51:23,080
It wasn't sealed,
and I read the whole thing.

433
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:27,292
You got me to talk,

434
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:29,753
to tell you things
I've never told anyone.

435
00:51:29,879 --> 00:51:33,006
Then you go and pass it on.
Great study material, eh?

436
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:34,716
You're not...

437
00:51:34,968 --> 00:51:36,969
You're going to talk now!

438
00:51:37,095 --> 00:51:40,347
If you have something
to say, by God...

439
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:55,279
No, don't!

440
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:09,626
Scared there for a minute,
weren't you?

441
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:15,340
For a second you were
genuinely scared, weren't you?

442
00:52:15,925 --> 00:52:18,468
A genuine
fear of death, huh?

443
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:21,638
"Alma's gone crazy,"
you thought.

444
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:24,391
Just what kind of person
are you anyway?

445
00:52:25,268 --> 00:52:28,854
Or maybe you just thought,
"I'll remember that face,

446
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:31,690
that tone of voice,
that expression."

447
00:52:31,816 --> 00:52:34,318
I'll give you something
you won't forget!

448
00:52:56,174 --> 00:52:58,008
You're laughing, are you?

449
00:52:59,761 --> 00:53:02,179
Things aren't
that simple for me.

450
00:53:02,722 --> 00:53:04,681
Or so funny either.

451
00:53:05,767 --> 00:53:08,018
But you always have
your laugh.

452
00:54:33,354 --> 00:54:35,605
Does it have
to be like this?

453
00:54:38,359 --> 00:54:42,487
Is it really so important
not to lie, to tell the truth,

454
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:44,948
to speak in a genuine
tone of voice?

455
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:49,286
Can a person really live
without babbling away,

456
00:54:49,454 --> 00:54:53,498
without lying and making up
excuses and evading things?

457
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:57,377
Isn't it better
to just let yourself

458
00:54:57,503 --> 00:55:00,338
be silly and sloppy
and dishonest?

459
00:55:02,091 --> 00:55:06,303
Maybe a person gets better by just
letting herself be who she is.

460
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:12,142
No, you don't understand.

461
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:14,978
You don't understand
what I'm saying.

462
00:55:15,146 --> 00:55:17,189
There's no reaching
someone like you.

463
00:55:17,315 --> 00:55:19,274
The doctor said
you're mentally healthy,

464
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,485
but I wonder if your madness
isn't the worst kind.

465
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:23,320
You act healthy,

466
00:55:23,488 --> 00:55:25,989
and the worst thing is,
everyone believes you.

467
00:55:26,115 --> 00:55:29,326
Except me, because
I know how rotten you are.

468
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:37,501
God, what am I doing?

469
00:55:41,005 --> 00:55:43,131
Elisabet, forgive me.

470
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:45,217
I'm behaving like an idiot.

471
00:55:45,343 --> 00:55:48,970
I don't know what got into me.
I'm here to help you.

472
00:55:49,096 --> 00:55:51,681
It was that awful letter.

473
00:55:51,891 --> 00:55:53,850
I was so disappointed.

474
00:55:54,018 --> 00:55:57,437
You asked me
to talk about myself.

475
00:55:58,022 --> 00:56:00,649
It felt so good. You seemed
so kind and understanding.

476
00:56:00,775 --> 00:56:02,859
I'd had a lot to drink,

477
00:56:03,027 --> 00:56:05,487
and it felt so good
to talk about it all.

478
00:56:05,613 --> 00:56:07,948
And I suppose
I was flattered

479
00:56:08,074 --> 00:56:11,535
that a great actress like you
would bother to listen.

480
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:14,287
I even thought
it would be nice if what I said

481
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:16,706
were of some use to you.

482
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:20,710
But that's awful, isn't it?
Sheer exhibitionism.

483
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:23,880
Elisabet,
I want you to forgive me.

484
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:27,259
I like you so much.
You mean so much to me.

485
00:56:27,385 --> 00:56:29,302
I've learned
so much from you.

486
00:56:29,428 --> 00:56:31,304
Let's not part as enemies.

487
00:56:54,412 --> 00:56:58,248
You won't forgive me
because you're too proud!

488
00:56:58,374 --> 00:57:02,252
You won't stoop to my level
because you don't have to!

489
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:05,422
I won't...

490
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:13,503
...we don't speak...

491
01:01:13,671 --> 01:01:14,879
...don't listen...

492
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:16,714
...can't understand...

493
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:23,137
...what means...

494
01:01:23,264 --> 01:01:25,640
...to persuade... to listen...

495
01:02:09,143 --> 01:02:11,978
When you sleep,
your face goes slack...

496
01:02:14,857 --> 01:02:17,525
and your mouth
is swollen and ugly.

497
01:02:20,571 --> 01:02:23,239
There's a nasty wrinkle
on your forehead.

498
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:34,250
You smell
of sleep and tears...

499
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:41,007
and I can see
the pulse in your neck.

500
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:45,303
There's a scar there
that you cover with makeup.

501
01:02:51,435 --> 01:02:53,478
He's calling again.

502
01:02:55,022 --> 01:02:57,523
I'll find out
what he wants from us...

503
01:02:58,525 --> 01:03:01,527
far away out here
in our solitude.

504
01:03:28,681 --> 01:03:30,807
Sorry if I frightened you.

505
01:03:32,059 --> 01:03:33,893
I'm not Elisabet.

506
01:03:34,269 --> 01:03:36,688
I'm not here
to make demands.

507
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:39,273
I didn't mean to disturb you.

508
01:03:39,483 --> 01:03:41,567
You think
I don't understand?

509
01:03:41,694 --> 01:03:44,487
The doctor
explained everything.

510
01:03:45,823 --> 01:03:49,617
But the hardest part
is explaining to your little boy.

511
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:51,786
I do the best I can.

512
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:57,208
There's something deeper down,
hard to get a grip on.

513
01:03:58,669 --> 01:04:02,296
You love someone...
or rather, you say you do.

514
01:04:03,215 --> 01:04:07,093
It's something tangible...
at least, as far as words can be.

515
01:04:08,512 --> 01:04:12,015
Mr. Vogler,
I'm not your wife.

516
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:14,392
And you're loved as well.

517
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:16,519
You build a community.

518
01:04:17,062 --> 01:04:19,147
It gives you security.

519
01:04:19,523 --> 01:04:22,150
You see a possible way
of enduring, don't you?

520
01:04:25,237 --> 01:04:29,365
How can I say everything
I've thought without getting lost...

521
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:31,868
without boring you?

522
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:43,379
I love you
as much as ever.

523
01:04:50,429 --> 01:04:53,264
No, don't worry, my love.

524
01:04:53,766 --> 01:04:57,060
We have each other.
We have faith in each other.

525
01:04:57,186 --> 01:05:00,271
We know each other's thoughts.
We love each other.

526
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:02,482
That's true, isn't it?
- Yes.

527
01:05:02,858 --> 01:05:06,861
And it's the effort that counts,
not what we achieve, right?

528
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:11,324
To see each other
as children,

529
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:14,160
tormented, helpless,
lonely children.

530
01:05:16,705 --> 01:05:20,333
Tell our little boy
Mommy will be back soon,

531
01:05:20,876 --> 01:05:24,545
that Mommy's been ill,
but she longs for her little boy.

532
01:05:24,797 --> 01:05:27,757
Remember to buy
a toy for him.

533
01:05:27,925 --> 01:05:30,343
A present from Mommy.
Don't forget.

534
01:05:30,469 --> 01:05:32,845
I feel such great
tenderness for you.

535
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:38,935
It's almost unbearable.

536
01:05:40,354 --> 01:05:43,189
I don't know what to do
with my tenderness.

537
01:05:45,067 --> 01:05:47,652
I thrive on your tenderness.

538
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:52,490
Elisabet, is it good
for you with me?

539
01:05:53,075 --> 01:05:55,076
Is it good for you?

540
01:05:57,287 --> 01:06:00,581
You're a wonderful lover.
You know that.

541
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:02,291
Darling!

542
01:06:04,128 --> 01:06:06,212
Give me a sedative.

543
01:06:06,338 --> 01:06:09,632
Toss me aside.
I can't go on!

544
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,050
My darling...

545
01:06:11,176 --> 01:06:12,593
Leave me alone!

546
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:14,887
This is shameful, all of it!

547
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:17,140
Leave me alone!

548
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:19,934
I'm cold and rotten
and indifferent.

549
01:06:20,853 --> 01:06:23,646
It's all just a sham and lies!

550
01:06:33,198 --> 01:06:34,866
What have you got there?

551
01:06:35,659 --> 01:06:38,161
What are you hiding
under your hand?

552
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:39,912
Let me see.

553
01:06:43,167 --> 01:06:47,503
It's the picture of your little boy,
the one you tore up.

554
01:06:47,629 --> 01:06:49,714
We have to talk about this.

555
01:06:57,681 --> 01:06:59,849
Tell me now, Elisabet.

556
01:07:01,101 --> 01:07:02,977
Then I will.

557
01:07:04,271 --> 01:07:07,315
It happened at a party one night,
didn't it?

558
01:07:07,858 --> 01:07:10,443
It was late, and the party
was quite rowdy.

559
01:07:11,612 --> 01:07:14,780
Toward morning someone
in the group said to you...

560
01:07:15,449 --> 01:07:17,909
"Elisabet, you have
practically everything

561
01:07:18,035 --> 01:07:20,036
as a woman
and as an artist,

562
01:07:20,204 --> 01:07:22,496
but you lack motherliness."

563
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:27,376
You laughed,
thinking it was ridiculous,

564
01:07:28,086 --> 01:07:32,089
but later you found yourself
thinking about what he'd said.

565
01:07:33,884 --> 01:07:36,177
You grew
more and more worried...

566
01:07:37,012 --> 01:07:39,764
so you let your husband
get you pregnant.

567
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:42,058
You wanted
to be a mother.

568
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:46,896
When you knew it was definite,
you became afraid...

569
01:07:47,022 --> 01:07:50,024
afraid of responsibility,
of being tied down,

570
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:52,526
of leaving
the theater behind,

571
01:07:53,153 --> 01:07:55,780
afraid of pain,
afraid of dying,

572
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:58,658
afraid of your body
that was swelling up.

573
01:07:59,868 --> 01:08:02,370
But you played
the part the whole time,

574
01:08:02,496 --> 01:08:06,040
the part of the young,
happy, expectant mother.

575
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:09,460
Everyone said,
"Isn't she beautiful now?

576
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:11,921
She's never been
so beautiful."

577
01:08:14,758 --> 01:08:18,177
Meanwhile you tried
several times to abort.

578
01:08:19,721 --> 01:08:21,597
But you failed.

579
01:08:22,391 --> 01:08:24,600
When you realized
it was inevitable,

580
01:08:24,726 --> 01:08:27,019
you began
to hate the baby

581
01:08:27,145 --> 01:08:29,855
and hoped
it would be stillborn.

582
01:08:33,235 --> 01:08:36,195
You hoped
the baby would be dead.

583
01:08:38,407 --> 01:08:41,117
You wanted a dead baby.

584
01:08:45,956 --> 01:08:48,833
It was a long
and difficult delivery.

585
01:08:48,959 --> 01:08:51,127
You were in agony
for days.

586
01:08:52,504 --> 01:08:55,047
The baby was finally
delivered with forceps.

587
01:08:55,173 --> 01:08:59,468
You looked with disgust at your
squealing child and whispered,

588
01:08:59,594 --> 01:09:02,346
"Can't you just die?
Can't you die?"

589
01:09:04,808 --> 01:09:06,726
But he survived.

590
01:09:08,312 --> 01:09:10,980
The boy cried
day and night...

591
01:09:14,026 --> 01:09:16,068
and you hated him.

592
01:09:16,903 --> 01:09:20,406
You were afraid.
You had a guilty conscience.

593
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:24,994
In the end,
some relatives and a nanny

594
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,163
took care of the boy,

595
01:09:27,289 --> 01:09:31,292
and you could leave your sickbed
and return to the theater.

596
01:09:34,129 --> 01:09:36,505
But the suffering wasn't over.

597
01:09:37,632 --> 01:09:39,675
The boy was seized

598
01:09:39,843 --> 01:09:42,595
by a vast, unfathomable love
for his mother.

599
01:09:42,971 --> 01:09:44,930
You resist.

600
01:09:45,057 --> 01:09:47,391
You resist desperately,

601
01:09:47,768 --> 01:09:50,644
because you feel
you can't return that love.

602
01:09:50,771 --> 01:09:53,147
You try and try...

603
01:09:54,358 --> 01:09:58,152
but your encounters with him
are cruel and awkward.

604
01:09:58,278 --> 01:10:00,029
You can't do it.

605
01:10:00,155 --> 01:10:02,198
You're cold and indifferent.

606
01:10:03,241 --> 01:10:05,368
And he looks at you.

607
01:10:05,535 --> 01:10:08,454
He loves you,
and he's so soft,

608
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:12,041
and you want to hit him
for not leaving you alone.

609
01:10:13,126 --> 01:10:17,129
You find him repulsive,
with his thick lips and ugly body

610
01:10:17,255 --> 01:10:19,882
and his moist, pleading eyes.

611
01:10:20,008 --> 01:10:22,551
You find him repulsive,
and you're afraid.

612
01:10:23,762 --> 01:10:25,805
What have you got there?

613
01:10:26,181 --> 01:10:28,724
What are you hiding
under your hand?

614
01:10:29,059 --> 01:10:30,601
Let me see.

615
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:38,734
It's the picture of your little boy,
the one you tore up.

616
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:41,195
We have to talk about this.

617
01:10:49,871 --> 01:10:52,164
Tell me now, Elisabet.

618
01:10:55,085 --> 01:10:57,002
Then I will.

619
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:02,508
It happened at a party one night,
didn't it?

620
01:11:03,343 --> 01:11:05,678
It was late, and the party

621
01:11:07,514 --> 01:11:10,850
Toward morning someone

622
01:11:11,393 --> 01:11:14,061

623
01:11:14,187 --> 01:11:16,313
as a woman
and as an artist,

624
01:11:16,523 --> 01:11:18,941
but you lack motherliness."

625
01:11:20,735 --> 01:11:24,029
You laughed,
thinking it was ridiculous,

626
01:11:25,115 --> 01:11:29,118
but later you found yourself
thinking about what he'd said.

627
01:11:29,453 --> 01:11:31,787

01:11:32,581 --> 01:11:35,332

01:11:41,715 --> 01:11:45,217

631
01:11:46,136 --> 01:11:49,889
afraid of responsibility,
of being tied down,

632
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:52,308
of leaving
the theater behind,

633
01:11:53,018 --> 01:11:55,561
afraid of pain,
afraid of dying,

634
01:11:55,979 --> 01:11:58,689
afraid of your body
that was swelling up.

635
01:12:01,026 --> 01:12:03,486
But you played
the part the whole time,

636
01:12:03,612 --> 01:12:06,989
the part of the young,
happy, expectant mother.

637
01:12:08,325 --> 01:12:10,534
Everyone said,
"Isn't she beautiful now?

638
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:12,661
She's never been
so beautiful."

639
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:17,750
Meanwhile you tried
several times to abort.

640
01:12:18,627 --> 01:12:20,586
But you failed.

641
01:12:22,214 --> 01:12:24,673
When you realized
it was inevitable...

642
01:12:26,301 --> 01:12:28,719
you began
to hate the baby...

643
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:33,432
and hoped
it would be stillborn.

644
01:12:36,811 --> 01:12:39,813
You hoped
the baby would be dead.

645
01:12:44,027 --> 01:12:46,654
You wanted a dead baby.

646
01:12:50,951 --> 01:12:53,827
It was a long
and difficult delivery.

647
01:12:54,496 --> 01:12:56,747
You were in agony
for days.

648
01:12:58,041 --> 01:13:00,709
The baby was finally
delivered with forceps.

649
01:13:01,378 --> 01:13:05,673
You looked with disgust at your
squealing child and whispered,

650
01:13:05,799 --> 01:13:07,925
"Can't you just die?

651
01:13:08,051 --> 01:13:09,885
Can't you die?"

652
01:13:10,554 --> 01:13:13,180
The boy cried
day and night,

653
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:15,391
and you hated him.

654
01:13:16,101 --> 01:13:19,562
You were afraid.
You had a guilty conscience.

655
01:13:21,731 --> 01:13:24,066
In the end,
some relatives and a nanny

656
01:13:24,192 --> 01:13:26,193
took care of the boy,

657
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:30,239
and you could leave your sickbed
and return to the theater.

658
01:13:32,284 --> 01:13:34,159
But the suffering wasn't over.

659
01:13:36,621 --> 01:13:38,664
The boy was seized

660
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:41,709
by a vast, unfathomable love
for his mother.

661
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:45,004
You resist desperately,

662
01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:48,340
because you feel
you can't return that love.

663
01:13:48,466 --> 01:13:50,759
You try and try...

664
01:13:51,803 --> 01:13:55,472
but your encounters with him
are cruel and awkward.

665
01:13:55,599 --> 01:13:57,433
You can't do it.

666
01:13:58,101 --> 01:14:00,561
You're cold and indifferent.

667
01:14:01,438 --> 01:14:03,522
And he looks at you.

668
01:14:03,773 --> 01:14:06,609
He loves you,
and he's so soft,

669
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:10,446
and you want to hit him
for not leaving you alone.

670
01:14:11,323 --> 01:14:15,284
You find him repulsive,
with his thick lips and ugly body

671
01:14:15,452 --> 01:14:18,037
and his moist, pleading eyes.

672
01:14:18,163 --> 01:14:20,748
You find him repulsive,
and you're afraid.

673
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:30,341
No!

674
01:14:31,801 --> 01:14:33,802
I'm not like you.

675
01:14:34,137 --> 01:14:36,472
I don't feel
the same way you do.

676
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:40,601
I'm Sister Alma.
I'm only here to help you.

677
01:14:40,894 --> 01:14:42,936
I'm not Elisabet Vogler.

678
01:14:43,063 --> 01:14:45,230
You're Elisabet Vogler.

679
01:14:45,649 --> 01:14:47,775
I'd really like to have...

680
01:14:49,069 --> 01:14:50,986
I love...

681
01:14:53,323 --> 01:14:54,823
I haven't...

682
01:15:29,025 --> 01:15:31,110
I've learned quite a lot.

683
01:15:45,834 --> 01:15:48,210
Let's see how long
I can hold out.

684
01:15:54,342 --> 01:15:58,220
I'll never be like you.
I change all the time.

685
01:15:58,346 --> 01:16:01,223
You can do what you want.
You won't get to me.

686
01:16:35,467 --> 01:16:37,259
Say nothing.

687
01:16:38,386 --> 01:16:40,262
Cut a candle.

688
01:16:40,388 --> 01:16:42,347
A kind of otherness.

689
01:16:42,557 --> 01:16:45,100
Not now. No, no.

690
01:16:46,478 --> 01:16:49,146
Warning and outside time.

691
01:16:49,272 --> 01:16:50,814
Unforeseen.

692
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:54,777
When it was supposed to happen,
it didn't, so... failure.

693
01:16:54,944 --> 01:16:56,862
You stand there,

694
01:16:56,988 --> 01:16:58,947
but I should do it.

695
01:16:59,115 --> 01:17:00,991
Not inward, no.

696
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:03,368
Say collect
and advise others.

697
01:17:03,495 --> 01:17:05,829
A desperate maybe.

698
01:17:11,044 --> 01:17:14,797
I take, yes...
but what is closest?

699
01:17:15,507 --> 01:17:17,549
What's it called?

700
01:17:17,675 --> 01:17:19,301
No, no, no.

701
01:17:19,761 --> 01:17:22,679
Us, we, me, I.

702
01:17:22,806 --> 01:17:25,265
Many words
and then disgust,

703
01:17:25,391 --> 01:17:28,852
unbearable pain,
the nausea.

704
01:19:00,904 --> 01:19:03,238
Try and listen to me now.

705
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:06,241
Repeat after me.

706
01:19:10,622 --> 01:19:12,205
Nothing.

707
01:19:15,752 --> 01:19:17,252
Nothing.

708
01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:20,464
No, nothing.

709
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:28,931
Nothing.

710
01:19:30,433 --> 01:19:32,017
That's it.

711
01:19:32,393 --> 01:19:34,102
That's good.

712
01:19:34,228 --> 01:19:36,271
That's how it should be.

713
01:23:51,319 --> 01:23:56,531
