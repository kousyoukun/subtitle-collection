1
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,738
Ambush, ambush! Checkpoint Danny Boy

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,098
Outnumbered, two men down.
Request backup. Received.

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,818
Backup deployed, three Warriors.

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,020
Everything coming.
Whisky 22, five minutes away.

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,178
This is Whisky 22,
approaching Checkpoint Danny Boy.

6
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,818
RPG and gunshot incoming.

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,538
I don't like it.
Just sit tight, mate, OK?

8
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,260
You're going to be all right.

9
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,738
Woody, listen up.

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,538
Enemy at dug-in. Your orders are
to leave the vehicle.

11
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,178
Sorry, say it again, Stick.

12
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,778
You want us to dismount into that?

13
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,058
They've got two men down.
They need help,

14
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,738
so prep the boys for dismount.

15
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,180
What's he saying?

16
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,938
We're going to dismount
and close with the enemy.

17
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,940
What, here? Just us?

18
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,620
After me. Be quick about it, yeah?

19
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,858
How does it feel
to be accused of war crimes?

20
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,340
It's Brian Wood.

21
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,898
A boy at school says
you were a murderer.

22
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,540
And that's what's upsetting you?
That is upsetting.

23
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,500
Come here, little man.

24
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,778
Say you're not.

25
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,540
Not what? Dad.

26
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,140
Bailey...

27
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,938
..do I look like a murderer to you?

28
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:02,978
The inquiry's terms of reference
are as follows, and I quote,

29
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,018
to investigate and report
on the allegations made

30
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,698
by the claimants against
British soldiers

31
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,538
on the 14th and 15th of May 2004.

32
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,060
Corporal Wood, do you understand
how matters will proceed?

33
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,980
I do, Sir, yes.

34
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,058
OK, lads, you're on your own.
Are you ready for this?

35
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,578
Butch, are you ready for this? Yeah.

36
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,540
Let's do this. Go, go, go, go!

37
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,660
Ah, Jesus, babe.

38
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,778
Do you ever get that thing,
you wake up

39
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,260
and you haven't got
a bloody clue where you are?

40
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,700
No.

41
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,378
Want me to tell you where you are?

42
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,860
I know now.

43
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,860
Want me to tell you?

44
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,860
Yeah, go on, then.

45
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,460
You are in London. Yeah.

46
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,018
To meet the Queen.

47
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,698
And why's that then?

48
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,540
Because you're a hero and she wants
to pin something on you.

49
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,258
Come on, wee man, come on.
Let's go find your mum.

50
00:03:52,260 --> 00:07:44,518
CHILD LAUGHS

51
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,338
Here we go, come on.

52
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,498
She's in there. Go and see her.
On you go, son.

53
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,738
Ho, ho! Look at this
smart wee laddie.

54
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,018
Hey! All right, Bailey boy?

55
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,658
How did you like spending
the night with Nana and Grandad?

56
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,098
Hello! He wants to see his mum.

57
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,018
Did you forget your kecks?
Is that a problem?

58
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,298
He's got great legs.

59
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,018
Look at my lovely boy.

60
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,218
He's our lovely boy.
Are you our lovely boy?

61
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,618
Are you our lovely boy?
Are you two not ready yet?

62
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,258
Do you know what time it is?
Er, tranquillo. Dad, be honest,

63
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,698
is this tie straight? It's straight.
Come on, get a move on.

64
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,298
Don't muss him all up, you.
Took me forever getting him dressed.

65
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,018
You might have to do the same for
Brian. Wouldn't be the first time.

66
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,258
Give that here and get your trousers
on. Right, that's it. Chop chop.

67
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,018
I'm putting you two on the clock.

68
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,340
T-minus ten.

69
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:49,060
23 years in the Army, son. It never
took me to places like this.

70
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,458
On the 14th of May 2004,

71
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,258
Lance Corporal Brian Wood
was sent to the aid of comrades

72
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,778
ambushed under enemy fire
at Checkpoint Danny Boy.

73
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,978
In recognition of his leadership,
courage and selfless action

74
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,458
during some of the fiercest fighting
in Iraq, Lance Corporal Wood

75
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,820
receives the Military Cross
for gallantry.

76
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,218
Come on, Brian. Keep up.

77
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,098
He does know other stuff,
but mainly he's keepers.

78
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,098
Don't tell me they have a coach
just for goalies.

79
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,258
But anyway, he asked me
to be the one taking penalties

80
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,338
for the goalies to have
penalty-taking practice,

81
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,498
cos he said they can never tell
where I was going to go,

82
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,338
and also I could put it where
I wanted it to go.

83
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,138
Whereas a lot of the other kids
just froze up

84
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,378
when it came to the spot kicks,

85
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,618
or looked at the keepers
and lost their concentration.

86
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,938
And he said... OK, OK, Brian.
Keep it brief.

87
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,938
Keep it brief.

88
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,138
So, you wanted to come out running.

89
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,738
Let's see what you're made of. Yeah?

90
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,138
Yeah.

91
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,378
All right. Yeah!

92
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,780
All right!

93
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,820
It begins with R, Brian.

94
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,498
Resilience.

95
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,700
Dad!

96
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,420
All right, Woody?
Where's your medal?

97
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,578
Sir, what's it like jumping out
of a Warrior under fire?

98
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,418
That's a good question.

99
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,700
It's, er, Johnno, right? Sir.

100
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,660
Johnno, I'm here today to tell
you all about the realities of war.

101
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,818
And maybe one of the realities
of war is it's not so easy

102
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,740
to stand up and talk about it.

103
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,498
And you're going to have
guys out there

104
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,778
who are making a big song
and dance about what they did,

105
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,178
getting their names in the paper.

106
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,258
Good luck to them. I'll let you make
your own judgment about that.

107
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,020
I've got nothing to say about that.

108
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,020
You know what I was focusing on?

109
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,460
Eh? Anyone?

110
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:57,738
I wasn't thinking about being brave,
being a hero or winning medals.

111
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,978
I was focusing on destroying
the enemy

112
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,140
and keeping myself and my men alive.

113
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,378
I was fighting my own fight.

114
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,498
I wasn't worried about what
everybody else was doing. All right?

115
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,218
That's a sure-fire way
to get yourself...

116
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,540
Corporal Wood?

117
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,100
Yeah?

118
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,258
Spencer.

119
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,858
I'm teaching. What's this about?

120
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,618
We just want a little chat with you.
A little chat?

121
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,298
Congratulations on the medal,
Corporal.

122
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,858
Are you going to tell me
what this is about?

123
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,300
We will, yeah.

124
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:02,380
You just take a seat here
for me, please, Corporal Wood.

125
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,978
We're going to show you photos,
Corporal,

126
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,138
from the Battle of Danny Boy,
from its aftermath.

127
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,698
You tell us if you recognize
anyone in them.

128
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,060
OK?

129
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,260
And this one?

130
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,618
What's this about?

131
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:40,500
Just whether you know who these
people are, Corporal. No.

132
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,700
That's my unit.

133
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,940
Him?

134
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,780
Do you recognize this detainee,
Corporal Wood?

135
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,778
Yeah, I, um...

136
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,740
I took him prisoner.
And what was the manner of that?

137
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,180
Do you recall the rules of
engagement, Corporal Wood?

138
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,060
Yes. So you took this man prisoner.

139
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,778
Tell me about the use of force.
He gave himself up.

140
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,938
He was armed?

141
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,978
Or was he just a man in a field,
or...? No, he was armed.

142
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,138
The CSM shouted,
"Drop your weapons," and he did.

143
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,140
The CSM just shouted...?
"Drop your fucking weapons," yeah.

144
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,058
You'd drop them, wouldn't you?

145
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,978
You've met the CSM.

146
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,500
Was he barefoot when you
took him prisoner?

147
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,420
Y...Yeah. Did you plasticuff him?

148
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,258
No, no, not at the time, no.

149
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,940
Did you offer him water?

150
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,178
Not that I recall.

151
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,980
I would've thought that date
was printed on your memory.

152
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,500
It is.

153
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,740
So, did you offer him water...

154
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,980
..Corporal Wood?

155
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,060
Did you?

156
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,980
Did you offer him water? Corporal
Wood... Or were you not there?

157
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,858
Sorry, say it again, Stick.
You want us to dismount into that?

158
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,138
They've got two men down.
They need help.

159
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,700
Prep the boys for dismount.

160
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,618
OK, lads. You're on your own.

161
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,418
Are you ready for this?

162
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,178
Butch, are you ready for this?Yes.

163
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,578
Let's do this. Go, go, go, go!

164
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,700
Go!

165
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,298
Enemy, bridge side.
We close with the enemy,

166
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,858
we take position one, yeah?

167
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,738
But that's 120 metres away.

168
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,298
Count us in.

169
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,298
Five, four,

170
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,058
three, two,

171
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,660
one.

172
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,460
50 meters!

173
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,138
Get on the ground now!

174
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,538
Get the fuck on the ground now!

175
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,900
Shut the fuck up!

176
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,740
Where'd the rest of them go?
They could be back any minute.

177
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,018
Position one.
Not a scratch on us, boys.

178
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,098
British fighting spirit done that,
mate.

179
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,860
Here we go lads. Get in.

180
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,940
Wait there, wait there.
I'll be right down.

181
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,898
Morning.

182
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,858
This intercom and security are here

183
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,458
because of all the threats against
us. It doesn't work properly,

184
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,658
so I spend all my time running
up and down these stairs.

185
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,058
It won't be the nutjobs
that kill me,

186
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,378
it'll be the exhaustion.

187
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,578
Thanks for coming up to the office
to see me.

188
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,298
It'll give you a chance to see
the job the way it really is.

189
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,138
Of course, I'm too bloody busy

190
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,658
to get up to the university
at the moment.

191
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,578
Some of you will end up in big
fuck-off law practices in the City

192
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,818
with smoked glass and neck massages,

193
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,778
but the vast majority of lawyers
work like this.

194
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,858
You'll need to get your brains
around that.

195
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,060
Right, straight through,
in here, come on.

196
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,658
My advice is go running,

197
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,538
do yoga, start flower-arranging.

198
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,498
Anything to give you
a sense of perspective.

199
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,618
This job will eat you up and spit
you out if you're not careful.

200
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,858
Who wants tea? Me. Ah.

201
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,338
What's your name?

202
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,980
Deena. Sugar? Two, please. Ah.

203
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,618
Oh, shit. There is none.

204
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,978
Er, right.

205
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:58,018
So, you want to be
human rights lawyers.

206
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,460
What's the first quality
you're going to need? Hm?

207
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,498
Got some sachets here somewhere.

208
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,218
Come on, I won't bite.

209
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,138
C-Compassion? Compassion? OK.

210
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,218
Anything else?

211
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:15,738
Empathy? A thick skin.
You're going to need a thick skin.

212
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,338
And why do I say that, Deena?

213
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,458
Because some of the things
we might be doing...

214
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,258
Because people will tear you up.

215
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,618
Politicians, the press,
the establishment.

216
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,218
It doesn't matter
how clear it is to you

217
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,818
that human rights are sacrosanct and
you have a duty to protect them -

218
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:36,418
whoever's they might be - other
people will tell you different.

219
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,978
They'll tell you're a bleeding
heart, they'll tell you

220
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,418
you're naive, they'll tell you
you're money-grubbing.

221
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:46,218
Why do they say those things?
Hm? Why do they say those things?

222
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,818
Who? The... Because now and then
you're going to have to tell them

223
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,418
things they really
don't want to hear.

224
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,060
And here's one of them.

225
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:00,178
British soldiers
get away with murder.

226
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,898
Who's heard of Baha Mousa?

227
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:06,778
Couple of years ago, Iraqi lad,
worked in a hotel in Basra.

228
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:10,138
About the same age as you lot.
He's, uh...

229
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:14,298
He's a father of two kids aged
two and four. He's dead, right?

230
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:18,178
He is now, yes. Brace yourself.

231
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:22,340
That's him after a period at
Her Majesty's pleasure.

232
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:29,298
So, on behalf of his family,
I respectfully argued in court

233
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:34,018
that Baha Mousa, in British custody
in Iraq, had the same human rights

234
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:37,618
as any other prisoner
in any other British jail.

235
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,418
Doesn't matter
if it's in Basra or in Birmingham.

236
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,378
Anyone want to argue with that?
The MOD. Ha!

237
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,098
The Ministry of Defense,
very good, they did indeed,

238
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,338
because it made their job
much more difficult.

239
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:54,098
But the High Court and the
Court of Appeal agreed with me.

240
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:58,298
British law applies wherever
British soldiers have command.

241
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,618
Anybody want to argue
with that principle?

242
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,618
Well, you want to be human rights
lawyers so I bloody well hope not.

243
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,098
But here's my question...

244
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,058
Tell you what, everyone,
come here. Put your drinks down.

245
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:14,820
Come round here.
Come on, chop chop. Over here.

246
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,978
Right.

247
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,698
Here's Baha Mousa.

248
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:24,098
Face-down in the dirt
with British soldiers all around him

249
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,778
with their SA80s
pointed down at him.

250
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:30,740
That's you lot, come on.
SA80s pointed down at him.

251
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,100
Now...

252
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,218
..we teach our soldiers
how to kill other soldiers in a war,

253
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,178
and there's nothing wrong with that.

254
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:48,938
But the judge found that Baha Mousa
died as a result of 93 injuries

255
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:53,540
incurred over a 36-hour period
in British Army custody.

256
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,538
I proved that case.

257
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:01,498
But not one soldier was found guilty
of murder or even manslaughter

258
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:07,018
or unlawful killing. Is it right
you guys get away with murder?

259
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,540
Put your guns down.

260
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:15,540
So, how come it's me
that's a disgrace to my country?

261
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:34,098
Shh. Push-ups.

262
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,460
DOOR CLOSES

263
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,140
Say if I'm buttering
too loud for you.

264
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,378
Brian, I just thought you might
call out to him or something.

265
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,778
I've been up with him since four.
I, uh...

266
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,940
I tried to get up for him
but he didn't want me.

267
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,220
It's going to take time.

268
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,260
You want him like this, don't you?

269
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,058
You want him all yours.

270
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,058
I'm not starting all that again.
If it's a problem at work,

271
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,620
let's talk about it.

272
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,340
Who is it?
That Phil Shiner?

273
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,738
Who wants to know?
David Monaghan. I'm a journalist.

274
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,380
You agreed to meet me.

275
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,780
Did I?

276
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,620
The Battle of Danny Boy.

277
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,540
Right.

278
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,980
Right.

279
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:23,738
Iraqi farmers, apparently,
at work in their fields

280
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:26,620
when the Princess of Wales Regiment
happened along.

281
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:33,058
With Baha Mousa you proved a single
act of terrible inhumanity.

282
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:37,178
This could be 20.
It's not a head count.

283
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:41,178
Footage of the dead bodies
was filmed by Al Jazeera and...

284
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,938
..there's some trophy photos
floating around,

285
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,178
taken by British soldiers.

286
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:49,698
The Red Cross demanded an inquiry
within days of what happened.

287
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,578
Military Police picked it up
but it's going nowhere.

288
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:57,218
Loads of inconsistencies
in what they did find.

289
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,900
Something stinks.

290
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:04,458
Make your program.
Get it on the screen.

291
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,978
Tell the world. I intend to.

292
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,698
So why do you need me?

293
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,820
I don't need you, Phil.
These people might.

294
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:18,458
Have you got any idea
the amount of work this would take?

295
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:22,300
How busy I am already? Just read it.
What have you got to lose?

296
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,258
Night, Phil.

297
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,700
Night.

298
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,900
Mazin, hi.

299
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,820
Yeah, thanks for getting back to me.

300
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,858
That's right, that's right. Listen,

301
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:46,580
I might need you to go back to Iraq
for me. Something new.

302
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,098
Same arrangement as before,

303
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,058
only...the scale of this thing
could be huge

304
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,818
so I'd need you to
track down witnesses,

305
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,740
sound 'em out,
and I'll meet them in Istanbul.

306
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,980
Right.

307
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,018
Babe.

308
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:48,260
He went to sleep!Shh!
He went to sleep! Ohhhh!

309
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,498
You're a star.

310
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:57,258
Come on. That's the first time
he's went to sleep for me.

311
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:02,180
I mean it, you're a star. Getting
there with him. The sleep master.

312
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,458
What?
Nothing.

313
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,140
Nothing.
No, babe, what?

314
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,058
You were like you used to be
just then.

315
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,940
When you came through that door.

316
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,938
Can't we have a happy moment?

317
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,658
I just took my son up to bed, I got
him off to sleep for the first time.

318
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,898
That's me, I'm being a dad,
I'm being a proper dad.

319
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,420
I am happy. You don't look happy.

320
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:39,618
I was at the doctor today getting
a prescription for sleeping pills.

321
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:43,058
Every other night you're waking up
not knowing where you are.

322
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:47,338
Yeah, well, no doubt about
where I am before I'm waking up.

323
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,498
OK...

324
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,620
Come on. Let's talk about that.

325
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,978
What's going on, Brian?

326
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,258
You really think, don't you,

327
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:02,820
that if you don't say anything's
wrong then nothing's wrong?

328
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,498
I feel like you don't want me home.

329
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,780
OK?

330
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:29,258
And I feel like
every fucking thing I do is wrong.

331
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,660
I don't know any more than you do.

332
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:16,460
Oh, we goin' on this run, or whit?

333
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,658
HE PANTS

334
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,780
I thought we were runnin' together.

335
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,500
15 years retired, I am.
Not whingeing, are we?

336
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:58,098
It wasn't cruelty
I was teaching you, Brian.

337
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,498
It was resilience.
Yeah, I know that, Dad.

338
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,340
I got that you did that.

339
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,340
Look, son...

340
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:14,460
..your mother's worried about ye.
Is everything OK wae you and Lucy?

341
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,658
Yeah. No, it's, um...

342
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,938
You know, one minute
I was in Al Amara

343
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,778
and the next minute I was
going in through the door

344
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,458
and seeing my baby boy
for the first time, so...

345
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,220
You know, it's going to, um...

346
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,340
You know, it's going to be a...

347
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,300
You never killed anybody.

348
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,820
No.

349
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,300
It never fell to me to do it.

350
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,618
But if it had, I woulda.

351
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:59,058
Mind you, it was Northern Ireland,
it's different.

352
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,258
You couldn’t tell
who was friend, who was foe,

353
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,978
and...it's Northern Ireland,
they're our own people, it's the UK.

354
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:09,018
You know, I trained for it
and I did it and it works

355
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:14,898
and you think...fuck, you know,
I'm alive and he's dead.

356
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,580
And then after...

357
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,618
You know we're here for you, right?

358
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,338
Yeah.

359
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:31,818
Then the RMP come knocking on your
door...The RMP? Are you kiddin'?

360
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:34,178
A decorated war hero?
Tell them tae piss off!

361
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:37,018
You can't just tell them...
They get your head in a spin, Dad,

362
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:41,938
you start thinking what you did or
didn't...You did a good job, son.

363
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,420
That's what you did.

364
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,700
Hey.

365
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,298
For 300 years

366
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,778
this family served this country.

367
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,538
12 generations.

368
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,020
Those guys...

369
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,100
..they're right here with us.

370
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,420
OK.

371
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,538
Brian?

372
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,298
Aye, he's all right. Just
Doesn’t like losing, that's all.

373
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,780
He's no' the only one.
Come on. Time to go.

374
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:27,378
Move!

375
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,660
Shut your mouth!

376
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,818
Get a blindfold on him!

377
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,378
Where'd the rest of them go?
They could be back any minute.

378
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,900
Get your cuffs on.
Blindfold! Blindfold!

379
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,338
Are we good?

380
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,498
Everyone OK? All good.

381
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,980
Boys, keep your heads down.
Remember, two-way range.

382
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:59,820
Is the battlefield clear?
No, Sir. No.

383
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:04,500
Right. Leave this shower
to your men. You come with me.

384
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:28,178
We're over-committed.
Back this way, come on.

385
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:32,058
Drop your fucking weapons!
Put your fucking hands up now!

386
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:36,420
Now! Here! Hands up!
Get your hands up right now! To me.

387
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,700
You. Arms.

388
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:46,418
He's good. Come here. To me now.
To me. Do you speak English?

389
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,620
Stay there.

390
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,858
He's clean.

391
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:54,058
Move, now! Go.
427

392
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,020
Why didn't they shoot us?

393
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:02,260
Hey! Why didn't you shoot us?
We never even saw you.

394
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,220
What kind of soldiers are you?

395
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,218
Go, go.

396
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,298
Keep going!

397
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,458
Lose your lives over a flip-flop?

398
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,500
Lose this again, I'm throwing it!

399
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,738
Go! Go!

400
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,978
Yeah, in English, mate.

401
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:33,498
Farmer! Farmer? He's a farmer?

402
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,538
You're a farmer,
I'm a fucking Brigadier, mate.

403
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,218
How old are you?

404
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,658
16!

405
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,178
16!

406
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,860
Stay there! Get a move on. Go.

407
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,820
Go.

408
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,580
Has he had his expenses?

409
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,498
His mother has.

410
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:00,220
Istanbul interviews,
day two. Time - 9:30am.

411
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:10,138
He was face-down in the ditch.
He could hear soldiers coming.

412
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:14,578
Take him back to the beginning.
Family set-up and all that.

413
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,338
Mother and sister hated Saddam

414
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:22,018
because Saddam killed
their uncle and cousin.

415
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,458
All family happy to see
British soldiers when they came,

416
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,618
friends bringing freedom.

417
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:30,418
Does he work? School?

418
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:47,018
School in the mornings,
farm in the afternoons.

419
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:50,578
That day he had to
cut fresh grass for his cow.

420
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,858
Did he have a gun with him?

421
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:06,498
For wolves, for bandits.
Kalashnikov.

422
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:11,138
Iraqi men in black clothes
with guns got out of trucks

423
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,658
and spread in the field
near the farm.

424
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:20,538
And when the British came past
there was shooting and he lay down

425
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,538
in the ditch, facing the ditch.

426
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,978
He was bleeding, crying,
asking them, "Please, stop."

427
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,138
They drag him a long, long way,

428
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:37,060
throw him in the vehicle
with dead bodies.

429
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:42,500
And...what happened to his weapon?

430
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,700
He didn't have weapon.

431
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:57,138
He said just now he did.
A Kalashnikov?

432
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:04,658
He had weapon but only at home.

433
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:09,058
I need to know whether he was
carrying the weapon that day.

434
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:14,498
Hm? Ask him, because
in his previous statement, here...

435
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:24,178
Here. He said he had it. Now..
if he's going to chop and change

436
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,058
he'll be no good to me
in the witness box.

437
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:41,618
What's he saying?
He says he's been waiting two hours

438
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:44,780
and he needs to eat.
Oh, does he need money for food?

439
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:51,178
No, he doesn't need money.
I'm telling him we're not finished

440
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:54,018
with this guy yet
but he's insisting.

441
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:58,138
Maybe we are...
Maybe we are finished here.

442
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,058
Thank you.

443
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,140
Thank you. Please.

444
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,420
Please.

445
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:20,460
And your name is...?
Hussein. Hussein.

446
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,738
And were you at
the Battle of Danny Boy?

447
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,058
Yes. And why were you there?

448
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:40,140
He is saying that he is...
Not fighter. I am farmer. Farmer.

449
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:49,658
Come on, then. The guys are out
the back. Hey, you all right?

450
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,860
Hi.

451
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,338
Nice one, keep bouncing.

452
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:06,178
It's not like you, hanging back
when there's meat on the grill.

453
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:09,380
Just taking it all in,
you know? A happy family.

454
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:19,538
I'm only here cos there were
two guys down there.

455
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:22,258
What, your mates had your back?

456
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,100
Iraqis.
Could have killed me but didn't.

457
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,378
What sort of soldier's that?

458
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,858
What sort of soldier won't even
fire his weapon? Brian...

459
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:35,140
What sort of soldier wears
flip-flops and a dish-dash? Brian.

460
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,298
You might only be here because of
those two guys but you are here.

461
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:43,300
No. Naw? I'm here
because they didn't do what I did.

462
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:49,060
You said you'd have killed
if you had to.

463
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,580
That's when you decide who's who.

464
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,260
That moment decides for you.

465
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:06,020
The dead have questions for you,
Brian.

466
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,500
You need to answer them.

467
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,218
Brian?!

468
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:26,618
Deep breaths, babe, deep breaths.
You're doing great, babe,

469
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:29,020
you're doing amazing.
Deep breaths, in and out.

470
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,738
I want my mum.
She's on her way. I can't do this.

471
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,538
Yes, you can, babe. You don't
know what I can and can't do.

472
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,260
I do, babe! I know you.

473
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:57,098
It is our contention
that British soldiers

474
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:01,338
abused and mistreated Iraqis
on the battlefield at Danny Boy

475
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:05,900
and afterwards at their base,
at Camp Abu Naji.

476
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,660
More than that...

477
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:13,700
..we believe that many of those
killed, injured or detained...

478
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,820
..were not soldiers at all.

479
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,938
There were farmers there
and innocent bystanders

480
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,658
going about their daily business.

481
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:28,058
We believe that the Army
carried out unlawful killings,

482
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,180
perhaps up to 20.

483
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,978
Any questions, please?

484
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:36,098
So the Iraqis were executed?

485
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,098
That's what we need to find out.

486
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,858
It's normal in that lawless
part of Iraq

487
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:46,260
for farmers to carry guns but...
does that make them soldiers?

488
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:53,498
British soldiers are held to high
standards and rightly so.

489
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,458
I see it as part of my job
to hold them to that.

490
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:59,418
And in my view,
there is powerful evidence

491
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:02,618
that on the day in question,
they let this country down.

492
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:05,778
So categorically you're saying
British soldiers killed civilians

493
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:08,458
in cold blood? What I'm saying

494
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:12,258
is the Army's own Military Police
investigation closed too soon.

495
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,978
It wasn't good enough.

496
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,938
That's why we've called upon
the Government

497
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,778
to set up a full public inquiry.

498
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:22,178
Brian's phone.
Leave a message.

499
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:25,178
We don't want to be talked about
in the same way as the Japanese

500
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:28,418
in the Second World War,
or the Americans at My Lai.

501
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,818
We need to get this all
out in the open

502
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:33,698
and only a public inquiry
can do that.

503
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,378
Several years have passed
since the Battle of Danny Boy

504
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,618
and the Ministry of Defense insists
the allegations are unfounded,

505
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,820
but has promised
its full cooperation.

506
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,820
It's a summons to a public inquiry.

507
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:53,178
This guy Shiner... He's all talk.

508
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:57,258
Well, he's not all talk, is he?
It'll come to nothing.

509
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,058
You're not looking.

510
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,220
Smile.

511
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,178
You know how you used to
complain about me

512
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,338
not wanting to know what you'd done

513
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:11,818
when you got your medal?
I was always joking.

514
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:16,420
It's YOU I wanted, not your medal.
Yeah, I know.

515
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,180
Do you?

516
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,580
Yeah.

517
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,460
Good.

518
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,858
Right. Show me that fuckin' thing.

519
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,778
Gavin...the baby.

520
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,180
The baby.

521
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:57,020
I'm sorry, love. Aye, he's lovely.

522
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:00,620
Hi.

523
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:06,338
Give you a medal wae one hand and
knock your teeth oot wae the other.

524
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,978
They accuse you of these things -

525
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:10,698
our own Government accuses you o'
these things -

526
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:11,898
on the say so of what?

527
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,498
The men that are trying to kill ye?

528
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:18,178
"In the engagement you participated
in, witnessed or were aware of,"

529
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:22,898
I mean, which one is it? Jesus
Christ. There's 11 counts here.

530
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:26,258
You must have been busy,
that's all I can say.

531
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,378
They probably sent the same letter
to all of us, Dad.

532
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,538
Nah, no way. Look.

533
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:33,498
"In the course of clearing the
trench with CSM Falconer and others,

534
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,940
"you were..." blah-blah-blah.
You. Nobody else. You.

535
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:43,138
The solicitors for the Iraqis
is saying that they were, um...

536
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,578
..farmers and not militia.

537
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,058
Are they tryin' tae tell me
you wouldn’t know the difference

538
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:49,818
between a farmer and a trained
killer working for...what his name?

539
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:52,338
Muqtada al-Sadr.God's sake.

540
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:55,500
Public inquiry.
The world's gone mad.

541
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,098
M...

542
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,540
My, uh...

543
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:18,378
Listen up. New orders.
We've got to pick up the enemy dead

544
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:21,578
and bring them back with us.
Intel reports person of interest

545
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:23,178
in the field.

546
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,498
Whose orders is this?

547
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,620
No-one does this.
We shouldn't be doing it.

548
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:34,698
Fuck this. They think some local
warlord is among the dead.

549
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:37,058
So we're taking the bodies
back for ID-ing.

550
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:38,860
Falconer picked us out for it.

551
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:43,098
Right, I'll pick him up.

552
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,378
You yank his trousers back up.

553
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:46,580
What?

554
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:50,140
Who did all that?

555
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:55,900
Chain gun could do that.
A 30mm tank shell.

556
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,900
Killing someone's one thing...

557
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:05,980
..picking them up after,
looking 'em in the eye...

558
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,058
Tell you what I don't see.

559
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,698
I don't see any village elders
who sent these kids out here

560
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:15,220
with rifles against a company
full of tanks and Warriors.

561
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,898
Drop your fucking weapons!

562
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:27,258
Killing someone's one
thing...picking 'em up after,

563
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:30,098
looking 'em in the eye...
Why didn't they shoot us?

564
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:32,538
Why didn't you shoot us?
We never even saw you.

565
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,580
What kind of soldiers are you?

566
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:46,618
Hey. Hey. Come on. Come here.

567
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:49,538
Come on. It's all right.

568
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,498
It's all right.

569
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:55,140
I'm here. Come on. Come inside.

570
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:57,620
Inside.

571
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:20,778
When the judges
approved our judicial review

572
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:24,618
they slammed the Military Police
and the Ministry of Defense

573
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:26,778
for not going far enough.

574
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:29,818
Took our side on every
point of substance.

575
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:34,018
Left the Government no option
but a full public inquiry.

576
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:37,818
Listen to this, Patrick.
It's not some Guardian editorial,

577
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:39,818
this is from the judge's own ruling.

578
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:42,258
"In our view,
the Military Police investigation

579
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:46,338
"relating to allegations of murder
and torture was deficient."

580
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:48,138
It wasn't fit for purpose.

581
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:50,178
No major incident room.

582
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:54,698
Failure to identity or interview
relevant personnel.

583
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:58,178
Failure to seize all
contemporaneous records.

584
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:00,538
Failure to interview the detainees.

585
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:03,378
Well, you've done an amazing job,
Phil, no-one's doubting that.

586
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,778
Getting a public inquiry awarded is
an extraordinary achievement

587
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:10,538
for a practice this size. But?

588
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:14,418
But nothing. So, the eminent
barrister's coming on board?

589
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:19,458
Coming on with the legal team
who, uh... Hang on. Where is it?

590
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:21,618
How did the judges describe us,
Deena?

591
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:23,778
They said we were greatly
outnumbered

592
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:25,898
by the Secretary of
State's legal team

593
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:29,018
but persisted with requests
for disclosure skillfully

594
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:30,978
and with commendable determination.

595
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:34,818
Commendable determination, Patrick.
Couldn't have put it better myself.

596
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:37,138
That war shames our nation, Patrick.

597
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:39,380
That's not what the
inquiry is about.

598
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:43,098
Ever thought of getting
a bigger office, Phil?

599
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,898
Having the walls closing in
concentrates the mind.

600
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,458
Doesn't it, Deena?
That's the theory, yes.

601
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:50,898
Right, so, what have you got?

602
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:54,378
"We", Patrick. We. Come on.

603
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:59,098
We've got 20 dead Iraqis taken
off the battlefield. Taken why?

604
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:00,858
The Army says the needed
to ID the bodies

605
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:03,178
but our witnesses say
at least some of them were alive

606
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:04,658
when they left the battlefield.

607
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:07,378
And some of them were beaten
and shot back at the camp

608
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:09,578
after they were detained.
More to the point,

609
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:13,018
the Army say they were combatants
and the families say they weren't.

610
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,818
What are you looking for?
The trophy pictures. Over there.

611
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:20,418
Shift your arse, Patrick.
You're sitting on Exhibit A.

612
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:23,298
Public Interest Lawyers.
Hi, Carrie. Is that...?Yeah.

613
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,098
Show these to Patrick.

614
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:27,418
I'll pass you over to him. Carrie?

615
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:30,458
So these are photos
taken by soldiers on the day.

616
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:33,178
You can see blood on the soldiers'
hands in this one.

617
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:35,378
Why do the Army need to take dead
Iraqis for ID-ing

618
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:38,058
if they had all these
cameras in the field? Exactly!

619
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:42,658
Carrie, I'm going to pass you back
to Deena. One second. Oh.

620
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:47,098
Hi, Carrie... There were cameras
everywhere. It doesn't make sense.

621
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,018
Look at these.

622
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:51,738
Look at the condition of these
prisoners. It's shameful.

623
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:55,018
I interviewed this guy in Istanbul.
He's willing to testify.

624
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:58,818
He's just a farmer. Almost all
of them say they were denied water.

625
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:00,938
They've clearly been knocked about.

626
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:02,378
It's a fucking disgrace, Patrick,

627
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:05,778
and it's our chance to expose it.
Our duty to expose it.

628
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:08,618
Phil, that's another delivery.
Well, can you deal with it?

629
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:11,258
The Iraqi witnesses,
what's your process there?

630
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:14,778
Vetted by my man in Iraq. If he
thinks they've got what it takes,

631
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:17,938
then I meet them
on neutral ground in Istanbul.

632
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:23,218
The funding? The High Court ordered
the MOD to reimburse all our costs

633
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,538
getting us this far.
Yeah, door's open, come on up.

634
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:28,378
You know how many gallantry awards
went to the soldiers at Danny Boy?

635
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:32,698
Ten. And to a man they'll be saying
the Iraqi witnesses are liars.

636
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:35,458
That the men they killed
were soldiers, shot in battle,

637
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:38,098
no-one was mistreated.
Course they will.

638
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:41,138
But you and I know what British
soldiers are capable of doing

639
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:44,338
to detainees.
Baha Mousa proved that.

640
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:47,738
And this is just as grave
and important as that.

641
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:52,138
Only more sprawling.
That's an understatement.

642
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:56,658
It's an uphill struggle, Patrick,
I get that. It always is.

643
00:50:56,660 --> 00:51:00,578
There's 40 shipping containers of
disclosure for us to wade through.

644
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:03,978
Signature, please. Hm? Oh.

645
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:06,698
This is the MOD sending us
a haystack, saying,

646
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:08,898
"Good luck finding the needle."
Thanks.

647
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:12,138
Do you want this job or don't you?
Cos as you can probably see,

648
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:15,258
we've got a lot of work
to get through.

649
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:17,380
I'll start with a sandwich. Hm?

650
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,218
Well, they've got crusts on,
Patrick.

651
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:23,300
Do you think you can cope with that?

652
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,898
You struggling, Dad?
Are you havin' a laugh?

653
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:32,418
Think I cannae handle
a couple of suitcases?

654
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:34,578
I'll put you through some
proper PT, boy.

655
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:38,458
Now don't you be worrying every day.
That's it. Call us any time.

656
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:40,018
All right? We're off. Good luck.

657
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:42,858
Bye. See you when I see you. I'll
give you a bell when we get back.

658
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:46,938
What's going on, little man?
He loves that boy. Loves them both.

659
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:51,220
Aw right, hen? You heard what
Margaret said. Get him back for me.

660
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:55,538
Getting angry
at what's happening to him,

661
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:58,020
it's not the same
as getting him through it.

662
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:10,538
Are you tryin' tae tell me
how tae father ma son?

663
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:13,898
You've done a very good
job of fathering him, Gavin.

664
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:17,858
He's just like you.
He's a soldier, like you.

665
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:20,058
He keeps it all in-house, like you.

666
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:22,298
He doesn't let on what's
going on up here

667
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:24,978
and he really thinks that's working.

668
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,978
He's like you.

669
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,900
He's just like you.

670
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:38,298
Point two, Charlie, eh?

671
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:41,898
Point two.
Is that the one you want to hear?

672
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,538
OK.

673
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:44,978
Point two.

674
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:51,858
There you've given an
untruthful and/or inaccurate account

675
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:55,298
in suggesting that the Iraqis
you apprehended

676
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:58,058
had with them any weapons at all.

677
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:01,178
You're incorrect to suggest or imply

678
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:05,460
that they had been shooting
at...British troops.

679
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:09,018
Point three.

680
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:11,780
Any failure to report
the misconduct or...

681
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:17,378
..or the allegations of misconduct
of which you were aware,

682
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:22,780
is the direct result - psst! -
by you deliberately...

683
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:26,860
..to conceal
the mis...conduct of others.

684
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,658
What kind of soldiers are you?

685
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:43,420
What's that? Hm?

686
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:46,540
What was what, Sir?

687
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:52,058
See you got a letter, then, Woody.
Is that from the inquiry?

688
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:55,940
Yeah. I did, Sir. Me too.

689
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,420
How's that settling with you now,
then?

690
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:02,860
I love soldiering, Sir.

691
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:08,418
I do, but...right now, it's...

692
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:11,898
Train you up, send you out to fight
then you get back for questioning.

693
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:14,738
I mean, what's that about?
Yeah, they were firing at us.

694
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:16,898
Yeah, live rounds.

695
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:20,340
And, no, I didn't...
gouge anyone's eye out.

696
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:24,418
You had all that, too?

697
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:25,460
Yeah.

698
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:29,618
Still think about them days?

699
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:31,698
Danny Boy and the rest?

700
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:33,540
Five years ago now, more...

701
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:39,618
I do, Sir.

702
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:40,660
Yeah.

703
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,100
Tough days.

704
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:45,820
Punchy days.

705
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:48,980
Yeah.

706
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:51,460
Immense.

707
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:58,300
Who do you talk to about them days?

708
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:02,060
Prefer to just sort of...

709
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:05,978
..you know,
keep it where it is, Sir.

710
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:09,018
For the time being. They're a
shifting cargo, though, Woody.

711
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,620
You sure that's a good idea?

712
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:14,498
Ever thought about knocking
on a door

713
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,338
and getting some help with that?

714
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:19,420
I'm fine, Sir.
You were just a kid then, Woody.

715
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,340
But you're not now.

716
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,140
Knock on a door.

717
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:29,220
I did.

718
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:47,738
OK. Stress test.

719
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:51,258
Their claims against ours. Deena.

720
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:55,018
The orders to take away the bodies.
Everything flows from that.

721
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:57,298
If they were dead,
like the Army says,

722
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:00,098
removing them is unprecedented
and needs a better explanation.

723
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:02,778
If they were alive,
like the families say...

724
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:04,858
..then they must have been executed.

725
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:08,178
Hm. So who gave that order?

726
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:10,220
No-one seems to know.

727
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:14,378
If the dead bodies needed ID-ing,

728
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:18,338
why didn't they photograph them
there? Hm?

729
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:20,738
Instead of transporting them.

730
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:24,380
The trophy pictures show that
there were cameras present.

731
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:29,378
If you were an Iraqi mother
searching through shredded bodies

732
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:33,498
in a morgue two days later, you
would suspect something very bad.

733
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,540
Lots of unanswered questions.

734
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:39,338
Patrick.

735
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:41,418
Bit of balance?

736
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:44,258
Well, the inquiry will want to test
the credibility of the witnesses -

737
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:45,978
when did their injuries occur,

738
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:48,618
how can anyone be sure they weren't
members of a militia group?

739
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:51,498
And the dead, too, for that matter.
The militia stuff...

740
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:54,258
..neither side can prove that.
That's our word against theirs.

741
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:56,578
It's not OUR word, Phil,
it's the witnesses'.

742
00:56:56,580 --> 00:57:00,338
We present their evidence
to the inquiry, we don't own it.

743
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:02,220
Very noble, Patrick.

744
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:07,578
Why did the Military Police
drop their investigation?

745
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:10,858
Incompetence or cover-up?
OK, what do we say to that one?

746
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:13,018
We say incompetence or cover-up.
Anything else?

747
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:15,338
As I'm reading I'm trying
to put myself in the position

748
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:17,218
of the Army soldiers.
Useful exercise.

749
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:19,138
If you're fired up
and you've been shot at

750
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:23,058
and you're charging across a field
and someone puts their hands up...

751
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:26,978
..where does the war bit stop and
the arrest and restraint bit start?

752
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:29,338
That's the inquiry's
focus in a nutshell -

753
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:32,018
what happens after the war bit
stops? It's grey...

754
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:35,698
It's a grey area. OK.

755
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:38,578
It is. So, you're fired up,

756
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:43,578
you've been shot at, you've taken
a guy with his hands up prisoner

757
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:46,500
and you live that grey area,
you're in it.

758
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:50,938
Maybe you knock him about -
is that what you're saying?

759
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:53,298
Why wouldn't you?I guess.

760
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,900
Hm. Well, here's your answer.

761
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:59,858
Because they're British soldiers.

762
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:02,818
They're trained
to be better than that.

763
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:06,498
Right. I mean, either they are
or they aren't. Right?

764
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:09,740
Either they are better than that
or they're not.

765
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:14,700
Sorry. Have to take this.

766
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,338
Hello?

767
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:19,380
Yeah. And...

768
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:25,458
Go on. The arrangements we used
to gather our witnesses,

769
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:27,778
the fact that we've operated
through a middleman,

770
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:30,940
some of the financial
arrangements... What?

771
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:37,180
Well...is all of that definitely OK?

772
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:41,580
We literally had no choice.

773
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:47,818
Either we let the killings of 20
potentially innocent Iraqis

774
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:52,820
go unchallenged or we do what
we did. What choice did we have?

775
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:57,098
If we win, it'll all be forgotten.

776
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:59,180
If we lose, it'll all be irrelevant.

777
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:13,978
Can't abide the coffee
they have here.

778
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:16,418
But if I leave my good coffee
in the kitchen,

779
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:18,298
everyone drinks it.

780
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:20,058
I've had your statement typed up

781
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:22,618
into the same basic form
as the other soldiers.

782
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:24,178
I want you to read it through now

783
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:27,140
and say if it's an accurate
reflection of what you told me.

784
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:31,538
Let's have it out loud.

785
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:32,858
There's a good chap.

786
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,338
It's good practice.

787
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:35,700
Yeah.

788
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:50,658
I deployed to Iraq on
the 8th of April 2004

789
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:53,220
in support of Operation Telic 4.

790
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:59,138
I deployed as a Lance Corporal
with A Platoon, C Company,

791
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:02,180
1st Battalion, the Princess
of Wales's Royal Regiment.

792
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:07,938
This was my first
deployment to Iraq.

793
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:10,058
My role was as dismount commander

794
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:12,338
and I would rarely
get out of the Warrior

795
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:14,858
as we would be vulnerable
to incoming fire.

796
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:17,778
The plan was to go
to the side of trench one

797
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,418
and take the enemy by surprise.

798
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:20,818
Three of us returned fire

799
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:23,418
in an attempt to suppress
the enemy position.

800
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:24,578
When I reached the trench,

801
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:27,298
there were still four
enemy combatants within it.

802
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:29,658
One of them was shouting in Arabic.

803
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:34,300
He had his hands in the air
and continued to shout.

804
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:39,538
I shouted back at him
something lines of...

805
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:41,258
Get your fucking hands up!

806
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:43,218
.."Put your fucking hands up."

807
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:46,778
The detainees were grabbed by their
clothes or arms and forced down.

808
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:48,858
There was a large number of weapons.

809
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:50,458
Once the search had been completed,

810
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:52,258
the detainees' hands
were plasticuffed

811
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:53,458
and they were blindfolded.

812
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:55,498
CSM Falconer took charge
of the situation

813
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,618
and said that he and I were
to advance to trench two

814
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:58,778
to check it was clear.

815
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:01,778
I saw an enemy combatant
stand up and aim at CSM Falconer,

816
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:03,098
who reacted very quickly.

817
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:04,498
Immediately after this,

818
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:05,938
I saw another aimed at me.

819
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:08,458
I fired two rounds at him
and saw him drop to the ground.

820
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:11,338
As we were walking back, two enemy
emerged with their hands up.

821
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:13,938
We had not seen them or
been aware of them at all.

822
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:17,340
It was lucky for us that they chose
to surrender rather than engage.

823
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:26,018
The order to collect the dead
was an unusual order.

824
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:28,460
It would be normal to leave
the dead on the battlefield.

825
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:33,338
I had not been in such
a situation previously

826
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:35,778
and collecting the dead
was a horrible job

827
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:37,300
that no-one wanted to do.

828
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:53,618
I was not offered any counseling
when I returned from my tour.

829
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:55,778
I do not recall
attending any debrief

830
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:57,500
at the end of my tour either.

831
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:02,100
I believe the facts in
this witness statement are true.

832
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:08,020
OK.

833
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:13,260
Well done.

834
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:26,260
You all right?

835
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:33,780
Hang on.

836
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:45,858
Isn't he home?

837
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:47,578
He's usually home by now.

838
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:48,820
Yeah, I don't know.

839
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:52,580
You haven't knocked.

840
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:00,940
You were right.

841
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:04,580
You were right in what you said.

842
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:08,860
OK.

843
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:12,258
Do you want to come in?
No, just...

844
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:14,580
Just get Brian out here for me,
will you, love?

845
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:42,140
Brian. Uh-huh.

846
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:56,860
You know I love you, son.

847
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:01,138
What, up to now maybe,
is that what you're saying?

848
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:03,378
See, that's just exactly it.
That's...

849
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:04,498
That's exactly it.

850
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:07,138
That's where Lucy's got her head
screwed on and me and you havnae.

851
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:10,338
That's... See, that's what it...
That's where she's exactly right.

852
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:11,818
Lucy? Dad...

853
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:13,738
Keep it all in house,
keep it in the head space -

854
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:15,100
what's the fucking point, eh?

855
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:24,740
I can see what you're doing, Brian,
and you took your cue from me.

856
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:28,138
And it's no good.
It's no good at all.

857
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:30,458
I shouldn’t have done it and you
shouldn’t be doing it.

858
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:32,738
All that...
"I'm a tough guy" bollocks.

859
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:35,100
Cos that's what it is -
total bollocks.

860
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:38,098
There's naebody tough. None of us.

861
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:40,738
No' me. No' you. No' Arnie bloody...

862
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:42,140
Schwarzenegger.

863
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:44,500
Aye.

864
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:54,418
You remember how I told you about
my pal who got shot by the IRA...

865
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:57,340
..shot and killed by the IRA? Yeah.

866
01:04:58,420 --> 01:05:01,460
And how I got promoted to
Lance Corporal cos he was dead.

867
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:04,378
Right after the funeral.

868
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:06,060
They even give me his callsign.

869
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:09,738
I didn't... I didn't know that.

870
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:10,940
Aye, well, now you do.

871
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:20,498
I didn’t even think about it.
I was 20 years old.

872
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,140
But see later, that gnawed at me.

873
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:26,698
It gnawed at me.

874
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:28,778
You know, his dying
and me just stepping up

875
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:31,098
and saying to the major,
"Aye, sure, gimme his stripes.

876
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:33,378
"I'll take his callsign."

877
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:35,058
It's like I wiped him
off the record,

878
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:36,618
no thought about anything else.

879
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:38,980
"Just got to get these tapes
sewed on." That was it.

880
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:45,540
But he found his way back in.

881
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:49,580
And rightly so.

882
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:54,298
There's never been a day
from that moment to this

883
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:58,058
that I haven’t thought about him
but did I tell anybody?

884
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:00,338
Dad...You know what it...

885
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:02,460
You know what it felt like?
It felt like...

886
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:08,258
It felt like I had to live
my life and his.

887
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:09,540
That's what it felt like.

888
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:14,820
That's what I meant when I said
the dead have questions for you.

889
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:20,098
You see, when you join the Army,
you're part of something massive.

890
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:21,818
You know, we're all
in this together.

891
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:24,218
But see you when it comes to
the knocks you take, we're...

892
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:25,460
..we're all a closed book.

893
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:29,340
OK.

894
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:33,978
I'm not a good example, Brian.

895
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:35,460
And that hurts me.

896
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:39,260
It hurts me to see you
following that example.

897
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:44,778
OK. Come in now, Dad. Come on.

898
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:46,780
No, no, no.
I've said what I came to say.

899
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:58,380
I couldn't be more proud of you,
son.

900
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:02,380
I couldn’t be more proud of you.

901
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:05,580
It's me I'm ashamed of.

902
01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:08,340
For not saying it to you sooner.

903
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:14,258
I said to your mother,
I said I couldn’t even contemplate.

904
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:16,178
Aye, sure, I served 23 years,

905
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:18,780
but I can’t even contemplate
what my son went through.

906
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:22,260
I'm in awe of that.

907
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:27,860
I have no experience of that.

908
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:33,780
And that hurts as a father.

909
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:39,020
I sent you places I've never been.

910
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:48,860
You were there, Dad.

911
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:54,420
You were there.

912
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:10,100
Oh, no.

913
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:13,418
Hey.

914
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:14,860
What did you say to him?

915
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:20,300
I said he should tell you
what was on his mind.

916
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:24,338
And did he? Yeah.

917
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:27,140
Yeah. Well, that's a good start
then, isn't it? Yeah.

918
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:32,938
All right, Bailey boy.

919
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:36,020
You beat your mum -
can you beat your dad?

920
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:38,778
That was a good shot.

921
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:40,338
And again.

922
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:41,818
Oh-ho-ho.

923
01:08:41,820 --> 01:08:42,940
Oh!

924
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:52,740
Dad!

925
01:08:56,860 --> 01:08:58,220
Bastard.

926
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:14,778
A public enquiry
opens today

927
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:16,818
into some of the most serious
allegations

928
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:18,498
to have emerged from the Iraq war.

929
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:22,178
It'll examine claims that British
troops murdered up to 20 Iraqis

930
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:27,138
following a gun battle in 2004 and
that nine detainees were mistreated.

931
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:29,418
The enquiry is expected
to last for around a year.

932
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:31,538
Slowly, please, Sir. Thank you.

933
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:33,698
Just a few last-minute thoughts.

934
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:37,538
Oh. More last-minute
than your 2am email?

935
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:40,458
The enquiry's terms
of reference are as follows,

936
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:44,418
and I quote, to investigate
and report on the allegations

937
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:48,058
made by the claimants
against British soldiers.

938
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:52,418
It is also necessary to examine the
broad circumstances of the battle,

939
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:56,498
the conduct and the actions
of the soldiers and Iraqis involved

940
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:58,618
and the manner and cause of death.

941
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:01,498
Why is this enquiry taking place?

942
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:04,658
This is a legitimate question
for all participants to ask

943
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:08,380
in light of the public expense
and resources inevitably involved.

944
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:11,018
There is a clear answer

945
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:14,658
and that is because of the credible
allegations of unlawful killing

946
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:17,018
by British soldiers
of Iraqi civilians.

947
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:18,540
Tank chaser.

948
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:21,818
You care to repeat that?

949
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:23,660
Why do you hate us
so much, Mr Shiner?

950
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:28,738
I've represented more soldiers than
any other lawyer in the country.

951
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:30,818
Disaffected soldiers, maybe.

952
01:10:30,820 --> 01:10:32,618
Is there any other kind, really...

953
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:34,020
..in the end?

954
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:45,218
A boy at school said
you were a murderer.

955
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:47,178
And that's what's upsetting you?

956
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:48,260
That is upsetting.

957
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:51,498
And what did you say?

958
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:53,578
He didn't say it to me.

959
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:55,258
He just said it.

960
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:57,220
Well, he must have
said it to somebody.

961
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:06,380
Come here, little man.

962
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:11,778
Say you're not.

963
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:13,660
Not what? Dad.

964
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:16,180
Bailey...

965
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:19,220
..do I look like a murderer to you?

966
01:11:22,180 --> 01:11:23,778
Hm?

967
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:25,340
Come on. Get to bed.

968
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:30,780
Goodnight.

969
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:44,098
Did you forget your kecks?

970
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:45,340
Is that a problem?

971
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:52,700
You OK?

972
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:55,140
Yeah, I'm OK.

973
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:59,098
Sure you don't want me to come?

974
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:00,818
Yeah.

975
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:02,380
Yeah, no, I'll be fine.

976
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:04,940
I'll be thinking about you.

977
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:12,858
Babe, I'm taking Bailey to school
before I go to London.

978
01:12:12,860 --> 01:12:14,220
OK.

979
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:21,660
Cheers.

980
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:28,658
Yo, let's get a move on.

981
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:31,698
Hey, you'd be good for your mum now,
little man. Yeah?

982
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:34,018
And you'd be good for me too.

983
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:36,340
Yeah. I'll be as good as gold, babe.

984
01:12:37,940 --> 02:25:15,878
HE WHISTLES

985
01:12:37,940 --> 01:12:40,658
Yo.

986
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:44,220
Love you. Have a good day. Thanks.

987
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:51,698
So...

988
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:54,780
..someone at school said
that I was a murderer, yeah?

989
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:00,098
Do you think they'd
say that to my face?

990
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:02,100
Huh? Why not?

991
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:05,898
Cos you're bigger than them. Yeah?

992
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:09,218
And who's bigger? Them or you?

993
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:10,698
Them.

994
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:11,740
Yeah.

995
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:14,980
Don't come to school, Dad.

996
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:18,580
Hey. Come here.

997
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:22,860
Look...

998
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:25,700
..for the record, Bailey...

999
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:29,418
..I did kill people.

1000
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:31,098
In Iraq...

1001
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:32,420
..in a battle.

1002
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:37,860
But I'm a soldier and sometimes
that's what soldiers have to do.

1003
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:44,260
What do you think about that?

1004
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:53,980
OK.

1005
01:13:56,460 --> 01:14:00,940
There's a difference between that
and being a murderer.

1006
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:03,300
What is it?

1007
01:14:05,420 --> 01:14:08,020
That's what I'm going to
London today to talk about.

1008
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:29,018
Who's up today?

1009
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:32,460
Brian Wood and...Chris Broome.

1010
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:38,780
What's that?

1011
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:49,538
Who sent this?

1012
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:52,578
The enquiry wanted an audit
of evidence for disclosure

1013
01:14:52,580 --> 01:14:55,978
from all the different teams.
This just turned up.

1014
01:14:55,980 --> 01:14:58,738
Turned up?
From where? From our side?

1015
01:14:58,740 --> 01:15:01,180
Maybe it was at the bottom
of a pile somewhere.

1016
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:09,578
So the local warlord lists all Iraqi
dead and detainees as his soldiers.

1017
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:11,180
Everyone there on the day.

1018
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:15,100
Shit.

1019
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:20,618
If they were soldiers, not farmers,

1020
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:23,818
the enquiry won't believe
anything else we say.

1021
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:25,340
Why didn't we know about this?

1022
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:28,500
We should have known about this!

1023
01:15:30,740 --> 01:15:32,220
Phil!

1024
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:39,618
For all we know it's...

1025
01:15:39,620 --> 01:15:42,578
..it's complete bullshit. It's...

1026
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:47,020
..propaganda put about
by local Iraqi militia.

1027
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:50,098
Turning them into martyrs. It's...

1028
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:52,978
The judge will throw it out
as irrelevant. Will he?

1029
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:54,138
How can you know that?

1030
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:56,618
Cos Patrick will point them
in that direction. It's obvious.

1031
01:15:56,620 --> 01:15:59,578
You told me a case is only
as strong as its weakest evidence.

1032
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:03,018
This casts doubt on our witnesses.
I'll tell you what's not in doubt.

1033
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:04,898
They're a bunch of lads
with Kalashnikovs

1034
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:07,618
that British troops threw
13,000 rounds at.

1035
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:09,378
That's what they are.

1036
01:16:09,380 --> 01:16:11,858
Lads at breakfast,
soldiers at teatime,

1037
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:14,778
lads again by bedtime,
if they lasted that long.

1038
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:16,380
I'll brief Patrick.

1039
01:16:45,820 --> 01:16:48,218
What did they say?
About the list? What do you think?

1040
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:49,578
They're taking it at face value?

1041
01:16:49,580 --> 01:16:51,938
Enquiry's already underwhelmed
by some of our witnesses

1042
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:54,338
and it's on headed paper,
it's got a bloody rubber stamp.

1043
01:16:54,340 --> 01:16:57,018
It's probably just a boast,
not a fucking employment record.

1044
01:16:57,020 --> 01:16:59,538
Our witnesses have most probably
never even seen that list.

1045
01:16:59,540 --> 01:17:01,018
Yeah, shame we hadn't either.

1046
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:02,778
It makes no difference.

1047
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:05,298
It makes no difference at all
to the human rights issues,

1048
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:07,418
it makes no difference
to what's important.

1049
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:10,018
It's one piece of evidence
amongst a mountain of stuff.

1050
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:11,458
It's not one piece, though, is it?

1051
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,098
It's part of a picture
that's emerging,

1052
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:15,018
a picture that's not
the one you wanted to see.

1053
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:17,938
It doesn't mean that terrible things
didn't happen that day

1054
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:21,098
or that everything our witnesses
say is lies. I know that, Phil.

1055
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:23,578
But things like this,
you start to look at best naive

1056
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:25,140
and at worst mendacious.

1057
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:27,738
It came out of nowhere.

1058
01:17:27,740 --> 01:17:29,900
It came out of somewhere
you didn't look.

1059
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:37,340
Some evidence has
just come to light.

1060
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:41,100
An official list from
the local Iraqi militia.

1061
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:46,018
It clearly identifies all the dead
and all the detainees

1062
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:48,260
as members of their armed group.

1063
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:52,140
It looks like they weren't
just farmers, Brian.

1064
01:19:20,140 --> 01:19:23,138
You know what
my vehicle commander said,

1065
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:25,500
at Danny Boy, when it was over?

1066
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:30,260
He said he didn't see
the elders there.

1067
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:34,898
Didn't see the ones in charge

1068
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:37,500
who'd send these kids out
in flip-flops to fight us.

1069
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:43,620
Then sent them halfway round the
world to fight us again in court.

1070
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:46,940
Where are they when
shit hits the fan?

1071
01:19:49,340 --> 01:19:50,618
Well, quite.

1072
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:54,258
If these people want to go and make
war a crime, that's up to them

1073
01:19:54,260 --> 01:19:57,458
but I didn't do anything to
be ashamed of in Al Amara.

1074
01:19:57,460 --> 01:19:59,100
I fought for my country...

1075
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:01,980
..and I'm proud of what I did.

1076
01:20:11,660 --> 01:20:13,900
But not doing anything
to be ashamed of...

1077
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:17,940
..doesn't stop me
from feeling ashamed.

1078
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:09,338
Who's that?

1079
01:21:09,340 --> 01:21:11,138
How does it feel to be
accused of war crimes?

1080
01:21:11,140 --> 01:21:12,300
Brian Wood.

1081
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:49,618
# In the mountain

1082
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:53,580
# The colored leaves
are falling... #

1083
01:21:56,020 --> 01:21:57,260
Corporal Wood?

1084
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:02,498
# Shots were fired

1085
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:05,780
# From the darkest moments

1086
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:16,298
# Like a child

1087
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:19,940
# Speaking to a stranger... #

1088
01:22:41,980 --> 01:22:43,220
Who's going to be there?

1089
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:45,938
Lawyers mainly.

1090
01:22:45,940 --> 01:22:47,698
Um...

1091
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:49,578
Some soldiers.

1092
01:22:49,580 --> 01:22:50,820
People from Iraq.

1093
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:53,698
Because you killed people?

1094
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:57,020
Well, not just me. There was
a lot of people killed, mate.

1095
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:02,300
And when you've talked about it,
then what?

1096
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:07,300
Well, when I've finished
talking about it, then...

1097
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:13,060
..then I'm finished
with being a soldier.
