1
00:02:27,813 --> 00:02:30,304
- What's your name again?
- Chrissy.

2
00:02:31,191 --> 00:02:33,480
- Where are we goin'?
- Swimming.

3
00:02:36,238 --> 00:02:39,488
Slow up. Slow down some.

4
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,117
I'm not drunk. Slow down.

5
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,537
Wait. I'm coming.

6
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,453
I'm coming.

7
00:02:50,586 --> 00:02:52,543
I'm definitely coming.

8
00:02:53,797 --> 00:02:54,960
Hold on.

9
00:03:04,808 --> 00:03:06,137
I can swim.

10
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:09,937
I just can't walk or undress myself.

11
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:31,745
Come on in the water.

12
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,249
Take it easy. Take it easy.

13
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:21,713
Help me!

14
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,719
I'm coming. I'm coming.

15
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,849
It hurts!

16
00:04:33,981 --> 00:04:35,096
Oh. My God!

17
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:47,108
Please help!

18
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:20,402
How come the sun didn't
use to shine in here?

19
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:27,399
We bought the house in the fall.
And this is summer.

20
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,489
Somebody feed the dogs.

21
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:35,537
Right.

22
00:05:39,421 --> 00:05:40,963
Do you see the kids?

23
00:05:47,304 --> 00:05:49,213
They must be in the backyard.

24
00:05:49,306 --> 00:05:51,346
In Amity you say "yard."

25
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:56,932
They're in the "yard".
Not too "far" from the "car."

26
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:02,141
- How's that?
- Like you're from New York.

27
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:07,107
Mom. I got cut. I got hit by a vampire.

28
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,690
You were playin' on those swings.
Weren't you?

29
00:06:09,785 --> 00:06:13,735
Those swings are dangerous.
Stay off there. I haven't fixed them yet.

30
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,455
I think you're gonna live.

31
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,246
- It's not the prettiest thing I've ever seen.
- Hello.

32
00:06:18,335 --> 00:06:19,995
- Yes.
- Can I go swimmin'?

33
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,337
Let me clean this thing off first.

34
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:25,589
What do they usually do?
Wash up or float up? Or what?

35
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:33,093
Keep 'em there. I'll be out in about...

36
00:06:34,935 --> 00:06:39,431
...15. 20 minutes. All right?
- Dry you off. Go on. Get a Band-Aid.

37
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:42,476
Got to go. Missing person.

38
00:06:42,609 --> 00:06:45,314
Season hasn't started.
Nobody's even here yet.

39
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,694
Listen. Chief...

40
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,657
...be careful. Will ya?
- In this town?

41
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,027
Hi. Dad.

42
00:06:55,372 --> 00:06:57,365
Wait a minute. Let me get on.

43
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,460
- I want my cup back!
- You'll get it.

44
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,380
Wave goodbye. Bye.

45
00:07:34,411 --> 00:07:36,320
Nobody saw her go into the water?

46
00:07:36,413 --> 00:07:39,533
Somebody could've.
I was sort of passed out.

47
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:43,247
- You mean. She ran out on you?
- No. Sir.

48
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,298
She must've drowned.

49
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,292
Look. I reported it to you. Didn't I?

50
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:52,842
- You live here?
- No. Hartford.

51
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,921
I go to Trinity. My folks live in Greenwich.

52
00:07:56,016 --> 00:07:58,590
- Your folks were born here. Right?
- I'm an Islander.

53
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,809
They moved off when my dad retired.

54
00:08:00,896 --> 00:08:02,972
- You an Islander?
- No. New York City.

55
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,808
You here for the summer?

56
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,396
Come on.

57
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,536
Hold it.

58
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:34,626
Oh. Jesus.

59
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:03,240
You're up awful early.
Is the Chief in there?

60
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:09,547
- Chief. What have you got on?
- Lf this new filing system is to work...

61
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,965
...you must keep that old stuff
off my desk. Just the pending.

62
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:16,218
Yes. Chief. We got a bunch
of calls about the Karate school.

63
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:19,638
It seems that the 9-year-olds
from the school have been...

64
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,258
...karate-ing the picket fences.

65
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:26,189
Chief Brody's office.
The Medical Inspector.

66
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,485
The Fire Chief wants you to go over...

67
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,783
I want a list of the water activities
that the city fathers...

68
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,417
...are planning for today.

69
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,616
Hendricks!

70
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,001
Where do we keep
the "Beach Closed" signs?

71
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,334
We never had any.

72
00:09:51,715 --> 00:09:54,835
There's a truck with New Hampshire plates
in front of my store.

73
00:09:55,844 --> 00:09:59,344
Just have him fill out the form.
Just fill it out.

74
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:24,702
Look what the kids did to my fence.
Eight and nine-year-olds...

75
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,498
- Glasses?
- Yeah. Glasses.

76
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:30,544
I'll call you later in the afternoon.
I promise.

77
00:10:35,884 --> 00:10:38,292
This stuff ain't gonna help me in August.

78
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,843
The summer ginks come
down here in June.

79
00:10:41,181 --> 00:10:43,803
You haven't got one thing
on here I ordered.

80
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:47,884
Not a beach umbrella.
Not a sun lounger. No beach balls.

81
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:50,146
If I can't get service...

82
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,106
Polly sent me to tell you
that there's a bunch...

83
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,949
...of Boy Scouts in Avril Bay.
Doin' the mile swim for their Merit Badges.

84
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,611
I couldn't call them in.
There's no phones out there.

85
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,450
Come on. Get out of there.

86
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:11,496
Take this stuff back to the office
and work on those signs.

87
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:14,920
"Beaches Closed. No Swimming.
By order of the Amity P.D."

88
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,549
Let Polly do the printing.

89
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,919
- What's the matter with my printing?
- Let Polly do the printing.

90
00:11:20,387 --> 00:11:21,929
Chief Brody!

91
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,768
What have you got there?

92
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,687
We had a shark attack at South Beach
this morning. Mayor.

93
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,848
Fatal. I have to batten down the beach.

94
00:11:32,107 --> 00:11:34,645
Albert. Come on. You kook.
Keep your arms up.

95
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,620
Charlie. Take me out to those kids. Will ya?

96
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:11,473
You're gonna shut down
the beaches on your own authority?

97
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:14,683
- What other authority do I need?
- You need a civic ordinance...

98
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,859
...or a resolution by the board.
- That's going by the book.

99
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:21,895
We're really a little anxious that you're
rushing into something serious here.

100
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,149
This is your first summer. You know.

101
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,785
What does that mean?

102
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,030
I'm only trying to say
that Amity is a summer town.

103
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,250
We need summer dollars.

104
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,958
If they can't swim here. They'll be glad
to swim at the beaches of Cape Cod...

105
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,672
...the Hamptons. Long Island.

106
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,916
That doesn't mean we serve
them a smorgasbord.

107
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,880
But we've never had
that kind of trouble in these waters.

108
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:47,639
What else could've done that?
A boat propeller?

109
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,512
I think possibly yes. A boating accident.

110
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:52,761
That's not what you told me
over the phone.

111
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:56,058
I was wrong.
We'll have to amend our reports.

112
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,938
- And you'll stand by that?
- I'll stand by that.

113
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:04,155
A summer girl goes swimming.
Swims out a little far.

114
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:07,610
- She tires. Fishing boat comes along...
- It's happened before.

115
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:11,238
I don't think you appreciate
the reaction people have to these things.

116
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,416
I appreciate it.
I'm just reacting to what I was told.

117
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,413
It's all psychological.

118
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:21,336
You yell "Barracuda!"
And everybody says. "What?"

119
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,927
You yell. "Shark!"...

120
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,556
...we've got a panic on our hands
on the Fourth of July.

121
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,844
Okay. You can take us back now.

122
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:49,107
I'm gonna get my raft
and go back out in the water.

123
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,946
Let me see your fingers.

124
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:56,328
- Alex Kintner. They're beginning to prune.
- Just let me go out a little longer.

125
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,874
- Just 10 more minutes.
- Thanks.

126
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,053
All I want to know...

127
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:10,886
I just want to know one simple thing:
When do I get to become an Islander?

128
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,051
Ellen. Never. Never.

129
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:16,014
You're not born here.
You're not an Islander. That's it.

130
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:16,325
Don't bother him. Come right back.

131
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,458
I know you got
a lot of problems downtown...

132
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:24,795
...but I've got a couple of problems
I wish you'd take care of.

133
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:29,342
One. I've got some cats parking
in front of the house. I can't get...

134
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,923
What I need is a red zone.
It's simple. You could take care of it.

135
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,260
Would you come here a minute. Please?

136
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,144
Are you okay?

137
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,270
Yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

138
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,565
Look. If the kids goin'
in the water is worrying you...

139
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,362
...they can play out here on the beach.

140
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,194
It's all right. Let them go.

141
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,209
It's cold.

142
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:11,385
We know all about you. Chief.
You don't go in the water at all. Do you?

143
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,963
That's some bad hat. Harry.

144
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,803
Chief Brody. You are uptight.

145
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:26,026
Come on. That's it.

146
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,997
Tippet! Tippet!

147
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,648
Did you see that?

148
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,078
Blood!

149
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,165
Everybody out!

150
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,509
Get them out!

151
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,389
Michael. Get out of the water!

152
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,320
Alex!

153
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,345
We don't even know
if there's a shark around here.

154
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,135
I can't argue with you. I can't talk to you.

155
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:25,099
I've got to talk to Mrs. Kintner.
This is turning into a contest.

156
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,936
It's not just the Gazette.
She's advertising in out of town papers.

157
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:33,190
I suggest we move to council chambers
where we'll have more room.

158
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:35,361
I'm responsible for public safety here.

159
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,235
Then go out tomorrow
and see that no one gets hurt.

160
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,322
It's a small story.
I'll bury it as deep as I can.

161
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:44,448
The ad is gonna run on the back
along with the grocery ads.

162
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,124
Right in here. Please.

163
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,413
Move on in. Please.

164
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,594
Why do you insist on playing the heavy?

165
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:10,519
I have a point of view and it speaks
for many of the people here.

166
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:17,277
Not only me. Because I have the motel.
How do you feel about it?

167
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,239
Let's have some order.

168
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,277
Let's have some order. Please.

169
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,991
Any special questions?

170
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:30,575
Is that $3.000 bounty on the shark
in cash or check?

171
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:35,670
I don't think that's funny.
I don't think that's funny at all.

172
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,335
All right. All right.

173
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:42,003
That's private business between
you fishermen and Mrs. Kintner.

174
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,972
Martin. Would you please...

175
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,269
Chief Brody.

176
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:53,481
I just want to tell you
what we're planning so far.

177
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,311
What about the beaches. Chief?

178
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:59,270
We're gonna put on the extra
summer deputies as soon as possible.

179
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,824
And then we're gonna try
and use shark spotters on the beach.

180
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,579
Are you going to close the beaches?

181
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,458
Yes. We are.

182
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,620
We're also bringing in some experts
from the Oceanographic Institute.

183
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,669
Only 24 hours.

184
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,177
I didn't agree to that.

185
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,300
Only 24 hours.

186
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:28,685
24 hours is like three weeks.

187
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,584
You all know me. Know how I earn a livin'.

188
00:20:57,214 --> 00:21:01,294
I'll catch this bird for you.
It ain't gonna be easy. Bad fish.

189
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:06,217
Not like goin' down to the pond
and chasin' blue gills or tommy-cods.

190
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:09,930
This shark. Swallow you whole.

191
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:15,314
Shakin'. Tenderizin'. Down you go.

192
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,936
And we got to do it quick.

193
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:22,190
Got to bring back the tourists that'll put
your businesses on a payin' basis.

194
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,572
But it's not gonna be pleasant.

195
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:28,863
I value my neck a lot more than $3.000.

196
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:34,332
I'll find him for $3.000.
But I'll catch him and kill him for $10.000.

197
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,078
You got to make up your minds.

198
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,462
Gonna stay alive and ante up...

199
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:42,882
...gonna play it cheap
and be on welfare the whole winter.

200
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,961
I don't want no volunteers.
I don't want no mates.

201
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:49,594
There's too many captains on this island.

202
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:53,134
$10.000. for me. By myself.

203
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:58,100
For that. You get the head.
The tail. The whole damn thing.

204
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,479
Thank you very much. Mr. Quint.

205
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,743
We'll take it under advisement.

206
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,748
Mr. Mayor. Chief...

207
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,377
...ladies and gentlemen.

208
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:54,195
Oh. God. You scared me.

209
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:02,041
People don't even know
how old sharks are.

210
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,548
If they live 2.000.
3.000 years they don't know.

211
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:09,213
Enough. You're not going to be able
to go to sleep tonight.

212
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,427
Here. Come on.

213
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:14,090
Thanks.

214
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:25,185
Want to get drunk and fool around?

215
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:26,852
Oh. Yeah.

216
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:33,199
Mikey really loves his present.

217
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,701
Where is he?

218
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:37,612
Sitting in it.

219
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,617
Good God.

220
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:47,874
All right. Michael. Out of the boat.

221
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:51,840
Tied up to the jetties. Sittin' in the boat.

222
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,882
I'm helpin' Michael.

223
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:55,849
- Get out of that boat.
- Hi. Dad.

224
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,808
Just a little longer. Please?

225
00:23:57,895 --> 00:24:00,812
- It's his birthday tomorrow.
- I don't want him on the ocean!

226
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:04,433
He's not on the ocean. He is in a boat.
He's not gonna go in the water.

227
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:08,904
I don't think he'll go in the water again.
After what happened yesterday.

228
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,824
Now don't say that.

229
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,275
I don't want that to happen.
You know that.

230
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,784
I want him to read the boating regulations.
The rules...

231
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,034
...before he goes out on his own.

232
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:26,547
Michael. Did you hear your father?
Out of the water now!

233
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:38,267
I'm tired.
Let's stop before someone reports us.

234
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,855
The chief lives on the other side
of the island.

235
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,230
Am I comin' in straight?

236
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,604
Just keep rowin'.

237
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:59,530
We better catch something.
This is my wife's holiday roast.

238
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,243
Don't worry about it.
$3.000 buys an awful lot of roast.

239
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:14,545
Come and get it.

240
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,681
The tide's takin' it right out.

241
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,397
Can't we go home?

242
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,917
He's takin' it.

243
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,873
Go. Go. Go.

244
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:03,574
Charlie. Take my word for it.
Don't look back. Swim. Charlie. Swim.

245
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:11,039
Come on. Charlie. Swim to me!
Keep comin'.

246
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:18,971
- I can't get up.
- Give me your hand. Charlie.

247
00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:24,763
- Help me!
- Get your feet out of the water!

248
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,032
Can we go home now?

249
00:27:49,043 --> 00:27:52,661
So then Denherder and Charlie
sat there tryin' to catch their breath...

250
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:57,167
...and figure out how to tell Charlie's wife
what happened to her freezer full of meat.

251
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:59,833
That's not funny. That's not funny at all.

252
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:02,633
Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad
in Field and Stream.

253
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:05,095
Looks more like The National Enquirer.

254
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:10,516
All right. Hold it. Hold it.
Hold everything. I said. Hold it!

255
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:20,278
- Hello.
- Hello. Back. Young feller. How are you?

256
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:24,360
Say. I hope you're not goin' out
with those nuts. Are you?

257
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,450
The Weetock boat's gotta move out first.

258
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,413
You have to move out.
Or he can't get out at all.

259
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:38,460
Don't raise sail. You're just gonna luff it.
You got a paddle on the boat?

260
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,552
Officer. Wait a second. Wait a second.

261
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:45,845
How many guys are you gonna put
in that boat?

262
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:47,344
Whatever's safe. Right?

263
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:50,768
- Yeah. Well that ain't safe.
- Watch it. That's dynamite.

264
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:55,564
- Where are you goin' with that?
- I'm goin' on the boat.

265
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,896
- Help me get those guys out of the boat.
- Sure.

266
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:05,075
Gentlemen. The officer asked me to tell you
that you're overloading that boat.

267
00:29:05,411 --> 00:29:07,237
Go on. Get out of here.

268
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:10,372
- You ain't going. What do you care?
- Can you tell me...

269
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,783
...if there's a good restaurant
or hotel here?

270
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,869
Yeah. You walk straight ahead.

271
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:17,421
They're all gonna die.

272
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:21,543
Listen to me.
We've got some road block signs outside.

273
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:23,794
You've got to get somebody to help us.

274
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,758
Yeah. Get those road block signs
out on the highway.

275
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:30,218
Because we've got more people
down here than we can handle.

276
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:33,347
What are you doing?
These are your people. Go talk to them.

277
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,230
They aren't mine. They're from all over.

278
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:39,265
You see the plates in the parking lot?
Connecticut. Rhode Island. New Jersey...

279
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:42,647
I'm all by myself out there.
What happened to the extra help?

280
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,112
That's not until the Fourth of July.

281
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,870
You know those guys
in that fan-tail launch out there?

282
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:50,278
None of them will get
out of the harbor alive.

283
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:53,955
That's what I'm saying. You know
their names. Talk to those clowns.

284
00:29:54,043 --> 00:29:58,254
- Everyone seems to be having a good time.
- Tell me about it. I'll get back to you.

285
00:29:58,339 --> 00:30:00,877
Could you tell me
how I could find Chief Brody?

286
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:01,997
Who are you?

287
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:05,046
Matt Hooper.
I'm from the Oceanographic Institute.

288
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:08,715
For Christ sakes. You're the guy we called.
I'm Brody.

289
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,800
- I'm glad to meet you.
- Me. Too.

290
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:13,728
I know you got a lot
on your hands right now. But...

291
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:17,264
The best thing for me to do is
to see the remains of the first victim.

292
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:18,768
The girl on the beach.

293
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:21,309
- Just bear with me. Will ya?
- Sure.

294
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:25,816
Wait'll we get them silly bastards
down in that rock pile.

295
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:27,319
There'll be some fun.

296
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:30,161
They'll wish their fathers
had never met their mothers...

297
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:33,780
...when they start diggin' the bottoms out
and slammin' into them rocks.

298
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:36,626
Get away from there. You goddamn fool!

299
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,294
What's the matter with you?

300
00:30:38,379 --> 00:30:40,786
You want to swamp us.
You crazy son of a bitch?

301
00:30:41,632 --> 00:30:43,790
What are these guys doin' out here?

302
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,880
- What are they doin' back there?
- They're chummin' right now.

303
00:30:47,972 --> 00:30:50,463
- What is that?
- They're tracking the shark now.

304
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:53,724
$3.000 divided four ways is what?

305
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:04,650
Let's show Mr. Hooper our accident.

306
00:31:08,284 --> 00:31:11,534
Victim identified as Christine Watkins.
Female Caucasian.

307
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:15,114
- And here's the way we have it.
- Probable boating accident.

308
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:26,124
The height and weight of the victim can
only be estimated from the partial remains.

309
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,595
The torso has been severed in mid-thorax.

310
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:36,851
There are no major organs remaining.
May I have a glass of water?

311
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:41,480
The right arm has been severed
above the elbow with massive tissue loss...

312
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:43,731
...in the upper musculature.

313
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,106
Thank you. Very much.

314
00:31:48,616 --> 00:31:51,949
Partially denuded bone remaining.
This was no boat accident.

315
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:56,744
- Did you notify the Coast Guard about this?
- No. It was only local jurisdiction.

316
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:05,503
The left arm. Head. The shoulders. Sternum
and portions of the rib cage are intact.

317
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:08,082
Do not smoke in here.
Thank you very much.

318
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:11,510
This is what happens.

319
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:17,426
Indicates the non-frenzy feeding
of a large squalus. Possibly longimanus...

320
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:19,436
...or isurus glaucus.

321
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:23,934
The amount of tissue loss
prevents any detailed analysis...

322
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:27,027
...however. The attacking squalus
must be larger...

323
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,651
...than any normal squalus
found in these waters.

324
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:33,030
Didn't you get a boat
and check these waters?

325
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:35,533
This is not a boat accident.

326
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:39,697
And it wasn't any propeller.
It wasn't any coral reef.

327
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:42,035
And it wasn't Jack the Ripper.

328
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:46,631
It was a shark.

329
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:05,315
I wanna go AP and UPI.
I wanna get on the state wire services.

330
00:33:05,485 --> 00:33:07,561
See if Boston'll pick it up and go national.

331
00:33:07,654 --> 00:33:10,821
Call Dave Axelrod in New York
and tell him he owes me a favor.

332
00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:14,027
This is the shot I want
with everybody and the fish in it.

333
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:16,740
Guys. Could we please get organized?

334
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:19,202
I want to get a picture for the paper.

335
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:24,165
- Ben Gardner get this?
- No. No. We caught it.

336
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:29,333
- That's swell.
- It's a beauty. Eh?

337
00:33:30,635 --> 00:33:33,672
I need a picture for the paper.
Clear out of the way. Please.

338
00:33:33,763 --> 00:33:36,681
Just the guys that caught the fish.
Open it up a little bit.

339
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:39,092
I want to get a picture
of the guy with the fish.

340
00:33:40,478 --> 00:33:44,061
I need a picture for the paper.
Could we get the sign please?

341
00:33:53,366 --> 00:33:56,118
Young fella.
Could you step out of the picture?

342
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,414
We're ready.

343
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,501
- Can you get that. Please.
- How's that?

344
00:34:10,925 --> 00:34:12,717
Larry. You won't believe it.

345
00:34:12,802 --> 00:34:15,472
- What kind of a shark is that?
- I don't know.

346
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,800
- I think it's a mako.
- It's got a deep throat. Frank.

347
00:34:18,892 --> 00:34:22,095
- Yeah. But what kind? What kind of shark?
- Tiger shark.

348
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:24,845
A what?

349
00:34:25,106 --> 00:34:26,435
We can start breathing again.

350
00:34:26,524 --> 00:34:29,194
- Is Ben getting plenty of pictures?
- You bet he is.

351
00:34:29,277 --> 00:34:31,484
What is this bite radius crap?

352
00:34:32,948 --> 00:34:37,194
You stuff your friggin' head in there man.
And find out if it's a man-eater.

353
00:34:41,456 --> 00:34:44,291
All I'm saying.
Is that it may not be the shark.

354
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:48,703
I want you to meet Matt.
This is Larry Vaughn. Our Mayor.

355
00:34:49,172 --> 00:34:52,623
- Matt's from the Oceanographic Institute.
- Nice to meet you.

356
00:34:54,886 --> 00:34:57,840
There are all kinds of sharks in the waters.

357
00:34:57,931 --> 00:35:00,173
Hammerheads. White tips. Blues. Makos...

358
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:03,102
And the chances that these bozos got
the exact shark...

359
00:35:03,186 --> 00:35:06,970
- There are no other sharks like this here.
- It's 100 to 1.

360
00:35:07,857 --> 00:35:11,606
I'm not saying that this is not the shark.
It probably is. Martin.

361
00:35:11,903 --> 00:35:14,821
It's a man-eater.
It's extremely rare for these waters.

362
00:35:14,906 --> 00:35:17,943
The fact is.
The bite radius on this animal is different...

363
00:35:18,034 --> 00:35:19,991
...than the wounds on the victim.

364
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:24,071
I want to be sure. You want to be sure.

365
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:27,416
We all want to be sure. Okay?
What I want to do is very simple.

366
00:35:27,502 --> 00:35:30,337
The digestive system
of this animal is very. Very slow.

367
00:35:30,422 --> 00:35:33,625
Let's cut it open.
Whatever it's eaten in the last 24 hours...

368
00:35:33,717 --> 00:35:36,967
...is bound to still be in there.
And then we'll be sure.

369
00:35:42,934 --> 00:35:45,259
It may be the only way to confirm it.

370
00:35:45,437 --> 00:35:47,678
Look. Fellas let's be reasonable.

371
00:35:48,023 --> 00:35:50,264
This is not the time or the place...

372
00:35:50,525 --> 00:35:53,859
...to perform some kind
of a half-assed autopsy on a fish.

373
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:58,529
I am not going to stand here
and see that thing cut open...

374
00:35:58,617 --> 00:36:02,365
...and see that little Kintner boy spill out
all over the dock.

375
00:36:26,853 --> 00:36:28,347
I just found out...

376
00:36:30,231 --> 00:36:32,769
...that a girl got killed here last week.

377
00:36:34,444 --> 00:36:35,903
And you knew it.

378
00:36:36,947 --> 00:36:39,272
You knew there was a shark out there.

379
00:36:41,743 --> 00:36:43,617
You knew it was dangerous.

380
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:46,909
But you let people go swimming anyway.

381
00:36:51,002 --> 00:36:52,911
You knew all those things...

382
00:36:56,716 --> 00:36:58,923
...but still my boy is dead now.

383
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:05,881
And there's nothing you can do about it.

384
00:37:11,982 --> 00:37:13,524
My boy is dead.

385
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:21,030
I wanted you to know that.

386
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:36,914
I'm sorry. Martin. She's wrong.

387
00:37:38,883 --> 00:37:40,259
No. She's not.

388
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:46,843
All right. Fellas...

389
00:37:46,933 --> 00:37:50,717
...let's cut this ugly son of a bitch down
before it stinks up the island.

390
00:37:50,812 --> 00:37:54,561
Harve. You and Carl take it out tomorrow
and dump it in the drink.

391
00:39:06,596 --> 00:39:07,711
Come here.

392
00:39:11,393 --> 00:39:12,673
Give us a kiss.

393
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:14,218
Why?

394
00:39:16,731 --> 00:39:18,190
Because I need it.

395
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:24,154
Get out of here.

396
00:39:26,741 --> 00:39:29,826
The door was open.
Mind if I come in? I'm Matt Hooper.

397
00:39:29,911 --> 00:39:31,405
Oh. Hi. Ellen Brody.

398
00:39:31,496 --> 00:39:34,532
Your husband's home?
I'd really like to talk to him.

399
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:36,161
Yes. So would I.

400
00:39:38,586 --> 00:39:39,997
Can I get you some coffee?

401
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:42,715
Wine. How nice.

402
00:39:59,851 --> 00:40:01,262
How was your day?

403
00:40:07,484 --> 00:40:08,563
Swell.

404
00:40:11,738 --> 00:40:14,573
I got red and white.
I didn't know what you'd be serving.

405
00:40:14,658 --> 00:40:16,033
That's nice.

406
00:40:17,452 --> 00:40:19,077
Is anyone eating this?

407
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,205
My husband tells me you're in sharks.

408
00:40:34,261 --> 00:40:38,590
Excuse me. Yes. I've never heard it
quite put that way. But yes. I am.

409
00:40:39,266 --> 00:40:40,546
I love sharks.

410
00:40:40,642 --> 00:40:42,931
- You love sharks?
- Yeah. I love them.

411
00:40:43,061 --> 00:40:47,355
When I was 12 years old. My father got me
a boat. And I went fishing off of Cape Cod.

412
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,599
I hooked a scup and as I was reeling it in...

413
00:40:49,693 --> 00:40:52,610
...I hooked a four and a half foot
baby thresher shark...

414
00:40:52,779 --> 00:40:54,855
...who proceeded to eat my boat.

415
00:40:55,657 --> 00:40:58,991
He ate my oar. Hooks.
And my seat cushions.

416
00:40:59,077 --> 00:41:02,280
He turned an inboard into an outboard.
Scared me to death...

417
00:41:02,372 --> 00:41:04,163
...and I swam back to shore.

418
00:41:04,249 --> 00:41:05,827
When I was on the beach...

419
00:41:05,917 --> 00:41:08,704
...I turned around and I saw my boat
being taken apart.

420
00:41:08,795 --> 00:41:11,417
Ever since then.
I have been studying sharks...

421
00:41:11,506 --> 00:41:14,756
...and that's why I'm gonna go
to the Institute tomorrow...

422
00:41:14,843 --> 00:41:17,927
...and tell them that you still have
a shark problem here.

423
00:41:18,013 --> 00:41:21,346
- Why do you have to tell them that?
- I'm sorry. I thought that...

424
00:41:21,433 --> 00:41:23,224
You told me the shark was caught.

425
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:25,931
I heard it on the news.
I heard it on the Cape station.

426
00:41:26,021 --> 00:41:28,476
They caught a shark. Not the shark.

427
00:41:28,982 --> 00:41:31,555
Not the shark that killed Chrissy Watkins.

428
00:41:31,693 --> 00:41:34,528
And probably not the shark
that killed the little boy.

429
00:41:34,613 --> 00:41:37,186
Which I wanted to prove
by cutting the shark open...

430
00:41:37,282 --> 00:41:39,773
You may want to let that breathe...
Nothing.

431
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:02,838
You'll be the only rational man
left on this island after I leave tomorrow.

432
00:42:02,933 --> 00:42:04,475
Where are you going?

433
00:42:05,811 --> 00:42:07,554
I am going on the Aurora.

434
00:42:07,729 --> 00:42:12,521
- The Aurora? What is that?
- It's a floating asylum for shark addicts.

435
00:42:12,609 --> 00:42:14,602
Pure research. Eighteen months at sea.

436
00:42:14,694 --> 00:42:17,898
Martin hates boats. Martin hates water.

437
00:42:18,824 --> 00:42:22,406
Martin sits in his car when we go
on the ferry to the mainland.

438
00:42:22,994 --> 00:42:26,743
I guess it's a childhood thing.
There's a clinical name for it. Isn't there?

439
00:42:26,832 --> 00:42:28,030
Drowning.

440
00:42:29,084 --> 00:42:33,331
Is it true that most people get attacked
by sharks in three feet of water...

441
00:42:33,463 --> 00:42:35,622
...about 10 feet from the beach?

442
00:42:37,425 --> 00:42:40,379
And before people started
to swim for recreation...

443
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:43,471
...I mean before sharks knew
what they were missing...

444
00:42:43,557 --> 00:42:46,392
...that a lot of these attacks
weren't reported?

445
00:42:47,853 --> 00:42:49,098
That's right.

446
00:42:50,564 --> 00:42:53,565
Now this shark that swims alone.
What's it called?

447
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:55,559
- Rogue.
- Rogue. Yeah.

448
00:42:56,528 --> 00:42:57,903
Now. This guy...

449
00:42:58,029 --> 00:43:01,445
...he keeps swimmin' around in a place
where the feeding is good...

450
00:43:01,533 --> 00:43:05,068
...until the food supply is gone. Right?
- That's called territoriality.

451
00:43:05,162 --> 00:43:08,495
It's just a theory
that I happen to agree with.

452
00:43:11,168 --> 00:43:15,331
Then why don't we have one more drink
and go down and cut that shark open?

453
00:43:17,549 --> 00:43:18,924
Can you do that?

454
00:43:22,554 --> 00:43:25,223
I can do anything. I'm the Chief of Police.

455
00:43:31,813 --> 00:43:34,185
We start in the alimentary canal...

456
00:43:35,817 --> 00:43:38,142
...open the digestive tract.

457
00:44:08,266 --> 00:44:10,757
- Just like I thought.
- What?

458
00:44:11,311 --> 00:44:14,810
Came up from the Gulf Stream
from southern waters.

459
00:44:20,028 --> 00:44:21,937
He didn't eat a car. Did he?

460
00:44:22,906 --> 00:44:25,527
Tiger shark's like a garbage can.
It'll eat anything.

461
00:44:25,617 --> 00:44:28,190
Somebody probably threw that in the river.

462
00:44:35,085 --> 00:44:36,164
That's it.

463
00:44:38,296 --> 00:44:40,966
I've got to close the beach. Call the Mayor.

464
00:44:42,092 --> 00:44:44,298
You got a bigger problem than that.

465
00:44:44,636 --> 00:44:46,925
You still got a hell of a fish out there...

466
00:44:47,013 --> 00:44:49,053
...with a mouth about this big.

467
00:44:53,728 --> 00:44:55,887
How do we confirm that by morning?

468
00:44:56,565 --> 00:45:00,432
If he is a rogue. And there's any truth
to territoriality at all...

469
00:45:00,777 --> 00:45:03,897
...we could spot him
between Cape Scott and South Beach.

470
00:45:03,989 --> 00:45:06,776
- Where're you going?
- To find him. He's a night feeder.

471
00:45:06,867 --> 00:45:09,358
- On the water!
- We're not gonna find him on the land.

472
00:45:09,452 --> 00:45:11,160
I'm not drunk enough to go on a boat.

473
00:45:11,246 --> 00:45:13,120
- Yes. You are.
- No. I'm not!

474
00:45:13,415 --> 00:45:15,075
- I can't do that.
- Yes. You can.

475
00:45:24,176 --> 00:45:27,342
I'm tellin' you.
The crime rate in New York'll kill ya.

476
00:45:28,096 --> 00:45:31,797
There's so many problems. You never feel
like you're accomplishing anything.

477
00:45:31,892 --> 00:45:34,347
Violence. Rip-offs. Muggings.

478
00:45:34,978 --> 00:45:38,347
The kids can't leave the house.
You've got to walk them to school.

479
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,061
But in Amity.
One man can make a difference.

480
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:45,978
In 25 years. There's never been a shooting
or a murder in this town.

481
00:45:46,698 --> 00:45:49,367
No kidding? Want a pretzel?

482
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,322
Where are we?

483
00:45:51,411 --> 00:45:54,412
We're right in the stretch
where he's been feeding.

484
00:45:56,792 --> 00:45:58,749
Can you get the Late Show on this thing?

485
00:45:58,835 --> 00:46:03,047
No. It's a closed circuit TV system.
I have underwater cameras fore and aft.

486
00:46:03,757 --> 00:46:06,960
Who pays for all this stuff?
The Government? The Institute?

487
00:46:07,052 --> 00:46:09,091
This stuff cost a lot of money.

488
00:46:10,764 --> 00:46:14,097
- I paid for this mostly myself. Actually.
- You're kidding.

489
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:16,977
- You rich?
- Yeah.

490
00:46:17,854 --> 00:46:19,183
How much?

491
00:46:19,272 --> 00:46:21,348
Personally or the whole family?

492
00:46:22,609 --> 00:46:26,358
Doesn't make any sense.
They pay a guy like you to watch sharks?

493
00:46:28,406 --> 00:46:32,618
It doesn't make sense for a guy who hates
the water to live on an island. Either.

494
00:46:32,702 --> 00:46:35,787
It's only an island
if you look at it from the water.

495
00:46:36,123 --> 00:46:37,914
That makes a lot of sense.

496
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,624
What is that thing doing?

497
00:46:48,135 --> 00:46:49,545
It's a fish finder.

498
00:46:49,636 --> 00:46:53,848
It's probably just a school of mackerel
or something. All clumped together.

499
00:46:55,809 --> 00:46:57,007
Wait a minute.

500
00:47:02,023 --> 00:47:04,775
- There's somethin' else out there.
- What is it?

501
00:47:05,485 --> 00:47:08,107
About 100 yards. South. Southwest.

502
00:47:43,106 --> 00:47:45,478
- That's Ben Gardner's boat.
- You know him?

503
00:47:45,567 --> 00:47:48,734
It's all banged up. Sure I know him.
He's a fisherman.

504
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:52,025
What happened?

505
00:47:58,747 --> 00:48:00,823
I got to go down there and check their hull.

506
00:48:00,916 --> 00:48:02,908
Wait. Why don't we just tow it in?

507
00:48:03,001 --> 00:48:05,670
We will. I just got to check something out.

508
00:48:05,879 --> 00:48:07,503
Keep the lights going.

509
00:48:32,197 --> 00:48:33,525
Let's tow it in.

510
00:48:33,615 --> 00:48:36,236
Don't worry. Martin.
Nothing's gonna happen.

511
00:48:41,414 --> 00:48:43,573
What am I supposed to do
while you're gone?

512
00:48:43,667 --> 00:48:47,914
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
Don't touch any of the equipment.

513
00:48:50,298 --> 00:48:52,208
I'll be back in two minutes.

514
00:50:19,846 --> 00:50:21,638
This is a great white. A big one.

515
00:50:21,723 --> 00:50:25,555
Any shark expert in the world
will tell you it's a killer. It's a man-eater.

516
00:50:25,852 --> 00:50:30,016
A great white shark has staked a claim
in the waters off Amity Island.

517
00:50:30,106 --> 00:50:33,273
He'll continue to feed here
as long as there's food in the water.

518
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:36,396
There's no limit to what he'll do.
We've had three incidents.

519
00:50:36,488 --> 00:50:38,694
Two people killed in a week.
It'll happen again.

520
00:50:38,782 --> 00:50:40,774
It happened before. The Jersey beach. 1916.

521
00:50:40,867 --> 00:50:42,907
- Five people were killed...
- In one week.

522
00:50:42,994 --> 00:50:44,453
Tell him about the swimmers.

523
00:50:44,538 --> 00:50:47,823
A shark is attracted to the exact kind
of splashing and activity...

524
00:50:47,916 --> 00:50:50,703
...that occurs whenever people swim.
You can't avoid it.

525
00:50:50,794 --> 00:50:53,036
If you open the beaches
on the Fourth of July...

526
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:55,881
...it's like ringing the dinner bell.
For Christ sakes.

527
00:50:56,091 --> 00:51:00,041
I pulled a tooth. The size of a shot glass.
Out of a boat out there.

528
00:51:00,137 --> 00:51:01,928
It was the tooth of a great white.

529
00:51:02,013 --> 00:51:05,845
It was Gardner's boat all chewed up.
I helped tow it. You should've seen it.

530
00:51:05,934 --> 00:51:09,184
Where is that tooth?
Did you see it. Brody?

531
00:51:09,312 --> 00:51:10,475
I didn't see it.

532
00:51:10,564 --> 00:51:13,233
- He dropped it on the way in.
- I had an accident.

533
00:51:13,358 --> 00:51:16,110
And what did you say
the name of this shark is?

534
00:51:17,946 --> 00:51:20,733
It's a carcharodon carcharias.
It's a great white.

535
00:51:20,824 --> 00:51:22,781
You don't have the tooth?

536
00:51:24,578 --> 00:51:26,736
We depend on the summer people
for our lives...

537
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:30,115
You are not gonna have a summer
unless you deal with this problem.

538
00:51:30,208 --> 00:51:33,660
We have to close the beaches.
And hire somebody to kill the shark!

539
00:51:33,753 --> 00:51:35,164
We have to tell the Coast Guard.

540
00:51:35,255 --> 00:51:38,126
You'll have to contact
the Shark Research Panel.

541
00:51:38,508 --> 00:51:40,584
You'll have to ring this entire harbor.

542
00:51:40,677 --> 00:51:44,260
I don't think either one of you
are familiar with our problems.

543
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:47,595
I know that you are going to ignore...

544
00:51:47,684 --> 00:51:51,018
...this problem until it swims up
and bites you on the ass!

545
00:51:51,271 --> 00:51:54,225
Wait a second.
There are two ways to deal with this.

546
00:51:54,316 --> 00:51:57,732
You're either gonna kill this animal.
Or cut off it's food supply.

547
00:51:57,819 --> 00:51:59,611
We have to close the beaches.

548
00:52:01,573 --> 00:52:02,853
Sick vandalism.

549
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:07,067
That is a deliberate mutilation
of a public service message.

550
00:52:07,913 --> 00:52:10,582
I want those little paint-happy
bastards caught...

551
00:52:10,665 --> 00:52:13,832
...and hung up by their Buster-Browns.
- That's it. Goodbye.

552
00:52:13,919 --> 00:52:17,916
I won't waste my time arguing with a man
who's lining up to be a hot lunch.

553
00:52:18,006 --> 00:52:19,381
Don't do this.

554
00:52:27,015 --> 00:52:31,677
What we are dealing with here.
Is a perfect engine. An eating machine.

555
00:52:32,646 --> 00:52:36,975
It's really a miracle of evolution.
All this machine does is swim...

556
00:52:37,275 --> 00:52:40,479
...and eat. And make little sharks.
And that's all.

557
00:52:41,154 --> 00:52:44,191
Now. Why don't you take a long.
Close look at this sign.

558
00:52:44,282 --> 00:52:47,117
- Those proportions are correct.
- You'd love to prove that.

559
00:52:47,202 --> 00:52:49,740
Get your name
into the National Geographic.

560
00:53:01,967 --> 00:53:05,336
Larry. If we make an effort today.
We might be able to save August.

561
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:09,386
August? For Christ sake.
Tomorrow's the Fourth of July.

562
00:53:09,474 --> 00:53:11,266
And we will be open for business.

563
00:53:11,351 --> 00:53:13,557
This will be the best summer
we've ever had.

564
00:53:13,645 --> 00:53:17,595
If you are concerned about the beaches
do what you have to. To make them safe.

565
00:53:17,691 --> 00:53:20,526
But those beaches will be open
for this weekend.

566
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,873
I want to know how many men
you're going to send.

567
00:53:45,969 --> 00:53:48,045
I don't need to come to Brisbane...

568
00:53:48,138 --> 00:53:50,427
...when I have a great white shark
right here.

569
00:53:50,974 --> 00:53:53,132
We need men to patrol the swimming area.

570
00:53:53,226 --> 00:53:56,144
We've got to have help.
Anybody with a gun or a boat.

571
00:54:09,659 --> 00:54:10,774
Monday!

572
00:54:12,662 --> 00:54:16,790
Is Chief Federal Officer Feldman there?
He's the little guy with a crew cut.

573
00:54:33,892 --> 00:54:37,593
Operator. Isn't there a phone on the island?
Could you connect me. Please?

574
00:54:52,911 --> 00:54:55,034
Brody to Gotcha. Do you read me?

575
00:54:56,665 --> 00:54:59,452
The guys from the TV station
on the mainland are here.

576
00:54:59,543 --> 00:55:01,701
All right. I'll get to them later.

577
00:55:05,257 --> 00:55:07,629
Brody to Scutbucket. Please come in.

578
00:55:14,516 --> 00:55:16,224
Brody to Daisy. Do you read me?

579
00:55:16,309 --> 00:55:19,725
Fascinating Rhythm, do you read me?
Come in, Hooper. What do you see?

580
00:55:19,813 --> 00:55:22,304
Nothing. Here. Martin.
And nothing on sonar.

581
00:55:22,816 --> 00:55:26,648
Amity Island has long been known
for it's clean air. Clear water...

582
00:55:26,945 --> 00:55:29,021
...beautiful white sand beaches.

583
00:55:29,364 --> 00:55:30,609
But in recent days...

584
00:55:30,699 --> 00:55:34,317
...a cloud has appeared on the horizon
of this beautiful resort community.

585
00:55:34,411 --> 00:55:37,163
A cloud in the shape of a killer shark.

586
00:56:06,693 --> 00:56:10,228
- Hi. Larry.
- Why aren't you in the water?

587
00:56:11,656 --> 00:56:15,868
I just put some sun tan lotion on.
And I'm trying to absorb some...

588
00:56:15,994 --> 00:56:17,987
Nobody's going in.

589
00:56:18,789 --> 00:56:20,911
Please. Get in the water.

590
00:57:22,769 --> 00:57:24,098
Do me a favor. Will you?

591
00:57:24,187 --> 00:57:28,019
You and the other guys take the boat
and put it in the pond instead.

592
00:57:28,733 --> 00:57:30,228
The pond's for old ladies.

593
00:57:30,318 --> 00:57:33,901
I know it's for the old ladies.
But just do it for the old man.

594
00:57:35,157 --> 00:57:37,778
- All right.
- Thanks.

595
00:57:50,422 --> 00:57:52,249
I've got Sean.

596
00:57:59,848 --> 00:58:01,307
Michael. Wait!

597
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:04,138
Michael. I don't like you no more.

598
00:58:29,544 --> 00:58:31,620
Daisy. Daisy. This is Hendricks.

599
00:58:31,922 --> 00:58:33,914
Anything? Thought I saw a shadow. Over.

600
00:58:39,095 --> 00:58:41,669
False alarm. Must be this glare.

601
00:58:52,734 --> 00:58:55,818
I'm pleased and happy to repeat the news
that we have...

602
00:58:55,904 --> 00:59:00,696
...caught and killed a large predator
that supposedly injured some bathers.

603
00:59:01,034 --> 00:59:02,659
As you see. It's a beautiful day.

604
00:59:02,744 --> 00:59:05,994
The beaches are open.
And people are having a wonderful time.

605
00:59:06,081 --> 00:59:08,654
"Amity." as you know. Means "friendship."

606
00:59:20,262 --> 00:59:23,595
My God!

607
00:59:33,733 --> 00:59:36,403
Jesus Christ! Fin! Shark! 350!

608
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:44,617
Martin, get them the hell out of the water.

609
00:59:49,332 --> 00:59:51,124
No whistles! No whistles!

610
00:59:51,293 --> 00:59:55,125
Everybody please, get out of the water.
Everybody out of the water.

611
01:01:01,613 --> 01:01:04,531
Give an answer, please.
What's going on out there?

612
01:01:08,537 --> 01:01:11,491
He made me do it. He talked me into it.

613
01:01:11,706 --> 01:01:15,953
Please. Please. Move back.
Please. Give these people some air.

614
01:01:18,046 --> 01:01:22,423
Martin it's just a hoax.
There are two kids with a cardboard fin.

615
01:01:23,009 --> 01:01:25,679
Everyone there okay?
Everyone get out of the water all right?

616
01:01:32,978 --> 01:01:35,303
Shark! A shark!

617
01:01:36,398 --> 01:01:40,727
- It's going into the pond! Shark in estuary!
- Now what?

618
01:01:41,653 --> 01:01:43,231
Michael's in the pond.

619
01:01:45,615 --> 01:01:48,569
Somebody do something! It's in the pond!

620
01:02:00,714 --> 01:02:04,130
- Hurry up. Get that done.
- I can't do a damn thing.

621
01:02:10,474 --> 01:02:12,799
Haul in your sheet. Make it fast.

622
01:02:17,439 --> 01:02:19,396
You guys okay over there?

623
01:02:19,691 --> 01:02:20,889
In the pond!

624
01:03:02,609 --> 01:03:06,310
Somebody get a gun and shoot it!
Doesn't anybody have a gun?

625
01:03:29,728 --> 01:03:32,931
- Is he dead?
- No. He's not. He's in shock.

626
01:04:04,179 --> 01:04:07,465
Doctor says he's okay. Mild shock.
He can go home in the morning.

627
01:04:10,268 --> 01:04:12,427
- How's my big kid?
- I'm all right.

628
01:04:12,521 --> 01:04:15,142
You gonna miss me tonight?
You can watch television.

629
01:04:15,232 --> 01:04:17,805
- Want anything from home?
- My cars.

630
01:04:17,984 --> 01:04:19,858
- What about ice cream?
- Coffee.

631
01:04:32,332 --> 01:04:33,957
Want to take him home?

632
01:04:36,211 --> 01:04:37,753
Like to New York?

633
01:04:38,296 --> 01:04:40,170
No. Home. Here.

634
01:04:59,025 --> 01:05:01,433
I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry.

635
01:05:02,487 --> 01:05:04,112
You got a pen. Larry?

636
01:05:04,906 --> 01:05:06,449
Yeah. Pen. You know.

637
01:05:10,287 --> 01:05:12,160
'Cause you're gonna do what you do best.

638
01:05:12,247 --> 01:05:15,450
You're gonna sign this voucher
so I can hire a contractor.

639
01:05:15,542 --> 01:05:19,753
- I don't know if I can do that without...
- I'm gonna hire Quint to kill the shark.

640
01:05:20,756 --> 01:05:22,250
- August?
- What?

641
01:05:23,216 --> 01:05:24,841
What are you talkin' about?

642
01:05:25,051 --> 01:05:27,210
Summer's over.
You're the Mayor of Shark City.

643
01:05:27,304 --> 01:05:29,759
These people think
you want the beaches open.

644
01:05:30,265 --> 01:05:32,934
I was acting in the town's best interest.

645
01:05:33,018 --> 01:05:35,010
You were acting
in the town's best interest.

646
01:05:35,103 --> 01:05:37,143
That's why you're gonna do the right thing.

647
01:05:37,230 --> 01:05:41,608
That's why you're gonna sign this. And
we're gonna pay that guy what he wants.

648
01:05:45,781 --> 01:05:48,402
My kids were on that beach. Too.

649
01:05:59,252 --> 01:06:00,533
Sign it. Larry.

650
01:06:10,472 --> 01:06:11,635
$10,000.

651
01:06:11,723 --> 01:06:15,092
- $200 a day, whether I catch him or not.
- You've got it.

652
01:06:15,477 --> 01:06:18,478
Get the Mayor off my back
so I don't have more zoning crap.

653
01:06:18,563 --> 01:06:19,892
You've got that.

654
01:06:20,107 --> 01:06:23,606
One case of apricot brandy.
And you buy the lunch.

655
01:06:24,027 --> 01:06:27,063
Two cases.
And you get dinner when you get back.

656
01:06:27,489 --> 01:06:30,739
Champagne. pit de foie gras.
Iranian caviar...

657
01:06:30,867 --> 01:06:33,074
...and don't forget the color TV.

658
01:06:37,124 --> 01:06:39,911
You try this. Made it myself.
Pretty good stuff.

659
01:06:40,001 --> 01:06:41,116
Thanks.

660
01:06:42,129 --> 01:06:44,667
Here's to swimmin'
with bow-legged women.

661
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:53,591
Excuse me. Chief.

662
01:07:08,405 --> 01:07:11,192
Can't get a good man these days. Under 60.

663
01:07:11,324 --> 01:07:13,732
All gone at least 35 years.

664
01:07:13,827 --> 01:07:15,238
Don't drink that.

665
01:07:21,084 --> 01:07:22,709
You'll need an extra hand.

666
01:07:22,794 --> 01:07:24,372
- This is Matt Hooper.
- I know.

667
01:07:24,463 --> 01:07:26,586
- I've crewed three Trans Pacs.
- Transplants?

668
01:07:26,673 --> 01:07:30,172
- He's from the Oceanographic Institute.
- And an America's Cup trial.

669
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:34,388
Mr. Hooper. I'm not talkin'
about pleasure boatin' or day sailin'.

670
01:07:35,307 --> 01:07:38,889
I'm talkin' about workin' for a living.
I'm talkin' about sharkin'.

671
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:42,227
I'm not talkin' about hookin'
some poor dogfish or sand shark.

672
01:07:42,314 --> 01:07:44,520
I'm talkin' about finding a great white.

673
01:07:44,608 --> 01:07:46,980
Porkers? Talkin' about porkers?

674
01:07:52,074 --> 01:07:53,983
Just tie me a sheepshank.

675
01:07:56,828 --> 01:07:59,948
I haven't had to pass basic seamanship
in a long time.

676
01:08:00,999 --> 01:08:03,407
You didn't say how short you wanted it.

677
01:08:06,088 --> 01:08:07,250
How's that?

678
01:08:10,801 --> 01:08:12,211
Gimme your hands.

679
01:08:14,054 --> 01:08:15,050
Dogfish?

680
01:08:15,514 --> 01:08:18,633
You got a $5.000 net
and you got $2.000 worth of fish in it.

681
01:08:18,725 --> 01:08:21,975
Along comes Mr. Whitey.
By the time he's finished with that net...

682
01:08:22,062 --> 01:08:25,929
...it looks like a kiddy's scissors class
has cut it up for a paper doll.

683
01:08:27,818 --> 01:08:31,650
You got city hands. Mr. Hooper.
You been countin' money all your life.

684
01:08:32,155 --> 01:08:35,524
I don't need this.
I don't need this working class hero crap.

685
01:08:35,617 --> 01:08:39,116
You're not gonna do this
aboard the ship are you. Mr. Quint?

686
01:08:40,872 --> 01:08:42,580
Maybe I should go alone.

687
01:08:45,877 --> 01:08:47,953
It's my party. It's my charter.

688
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:51,500
Yeah. It's your charter. It's your party.
It's my vessel.

689
01:08:51,591 --> 01:08:53,418
You're on board my vessel...

690
01:08:53,510 --> 01:08:55,301
...I'm mate. Master. Pilot...

691
01:08:56,304 --> 01:08:57,799
...and I'm captain.

692
01:09:01,184 --> 01:09:03,343
I'll take him for ballast. Chief.

693
01:09:06,022 --> 01:09:07,054
You got him.

694
01:09:11,361 --> 01:09:15,738
Tail rope. Eye splice. M-1. pliers. Irons...

695
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:19,617
Sample bottles. Dye marker.
Flares. Safety float...

696
01:09:19,703 --> 01:09:22,490
...temperature gauge. Spear guns. SMG...

697
01:09:22,581 --> 01:09:25,416
What are you?
Some kind of half-assed astronaut?

698
01:09:34,551 --> 01:09:37,801
Take that stuff down below
and you lash it secure.

699
01:09:43,059 --> 01:09:44,684
Jesus H. Christ!

700
01:09:45,228 --> 01:09:50,021
When I was a boy. Every squirt wanted
to be a harpooner or a swordfisherman.

701
01:09:51,193 --> 01:09:54,478
What have you got here?
A portable shower or a monkey cage?

702
01:09:54,571 --> 01:09:57,607
- An anti-shark cage.
- Anti-shark cage?

703
01:09:58,950 --> 01:10:00,658
You go inside the cage?

704
01:10:02,746 --> 01:10:04,454
Cage goes in the water?

705
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:07,327
You go in the water? Shark's in the water.

706
01:10:08,668 --> 01:10:09,783
Our shark.

707
01:10:11,963 --> 01:10:16,210
"Farewell and adieu to you.
Fair Spanish ladies

708
01:10:17,219 --> 01:10:20,884
"Farewell and adieu. You ladies of Spain

709
01:10:21,932 --> 01:10:26,558
"For we've received orders
for to sail back to Boston

710
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:32,643
"And so never more
shall we see you again"

711
01:10:39,574 --> 01:10:41,982
- Did you take your Dramamine?
- Yes.

712
01:10:42,702 --> 01:10:46,036
I put an extra pair of glasses
in your black socks...

713
01:10:46,456 --> 01:10:50,952
...and there's the stuff for your nose.
The zinc oxide and Blistex is in the kit.

714
01:10:53,130 --> 01:10:55,585
Goddamn women today.
They can't handle nothin'.

715
01:10:55,674 --> 01:10:59,173
Young girls just ain't quite smart
like their grandmothers were.

716
01:10:59,261 --> 01:11:01,253
That's got to be Quint.

717
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:02,805
Colorful. Isn't he?

718
01:11:02,889 --> 01:11:04,348
He scares me.

719
01:11:06,476 --> 01:11:10,260
- Don't use the fireplace in the den.
- What am I gonna tell the kids?

720
01:11:13,942 --> 01:11:15,851
Tell them I'm going fishing.

721
01:11:20,824 --> 01:11:24,193
Break it up. Will ya. Chief?
Daylight's wastin'.

722
01:11:26,997 --> 01:11:28,740
Front: Bow. Back: Stern.

723
01:11:29,332 --> 01:11:30,875
Better get it right. Squirt...

724
01:11:30,959 --> 01:11:34,542
...or I throw your ass out
the little round window on the side.

725
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:37,168
This isn't no Boy Scout picnic.

726
01:11:37,758 --> 01:11:39,584
See you got your rubbers.

727
01:11:42,012 --> 01:11:46,472
"Here lies the body of Mary Lee.
Died at the age of 103

728
01:11:46,850 --> 01:11:51,761
"For 15 years she kept her virginity.
Not a bad record for this vicinity"

729
01:11:52,481 --> 01:11:55,766
All right. Commissioner.
Fasten your safety belt.

730
01:11:57,486 --> 01:12:00,237
If you see a shark. Hooper. Swallow.

731
01:12:03,867 --> 01:12:07,200
Up periscope. Rig for depth charge.

732
01:12:16,421 --> 01:12:18,129
How's the Missus. Chief?

733
01:12:19,216 --> 01:12:22,798
If they don't like you goin' out.
They'll love you comin' in.

734
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:51,823
Keep that chum line goin'.
We got five good miles on it.

735
01:12:54,042 --> 01:12:56,996
- Who's driving this boat?
- Nobody. The tide.

736
01:12:58,296 --> 01:13:02,246
One time. I caught a 16-footer off Montauk.
Had to stick two barrels in him.

737
01:13:02,342 --> 01:13:04,714
Two to wear him down and bring him up.

738
01:13:05,637 --> 01:13:08,093
Nowadays. These kids.
They take out everything.

739
01:13:08,181 --> 01:13:11,882
Radar. Sonar. Electric toothbrushes.

740
01:13:15,021 --> 01:13:16,397
Jesus H. Christ.

741
01:13:17,941 --> 01:13:20,728
Best drop another chum marker.

742
01:13:43,091 --> 01:13:44,633
Damn it. Martin!

743
01:13:45,469 --> 01:13:47,176
This is compressed air.

744
01:13:47,262 --> 01:13:50,761
- What the hell kind of a knot was that?
- You pulled the wrong one.

745
01:13:50,849 --> 01:13:54,052
You screw around with these tanks.
And they're gonna blow up.

746
01:13:54,144 --> 01:13:57,727
Yeah. That's real fine.
Expensive gear you've brought out here.

747
01:13:58,857 --> 01:14:01,644
I don't know what
that bastard shark's gonna do with it.

748
01:14:01,735 --> 01:14:05,649
Might eat it. I suppose.
Seen one eat a rockin' chair one time.

749
01:14:09,826 --> 01:14:12,911
Next time.
You just ask me which line to pull. Right?

750
01:14:19,211 --> 01:14:21,749
Little brown eel comes out of the cave...

751
01:14:22,631 --> 01:14:24,374
...swims into the hole...

752
01:14:25,842 --> 01:14:28,843
...comes out of the hole.
Back into the cave again.

753
01:14:30,305 --> 01:14:32,048
It's not too good. Is it?

754
01:14:32,849 --> 01:14:35,684
Nothin's easy. Is it? One more time.

755
01:15:56,683 --> 01:15:57,798
I got it.

756
01:15:59,478 --> 01:16:01,517
- What?
- Get behind me.

757
01:16:04,941 --> 01:16:06,685
Hooper. Reverse her!

758
01:16:07,527 --> 01:16:09,567
Takin' a hell of a lot of line.

759
01:16:09,988 --> 01:16:12,775
Get the scoop out of the bucket.
Wet the reel.

760
01:16:18,038 --> 01:16:19,662
Reverse her!

761
01:16:22,417 --> 01:16:25,751
Duck your head down.
We're swingin'. Get behind me again.

762
01:16:26,421 --> 01:16:29,292
No more water.
I don't want you to drown me.

763
01:16:29,925 --> 01:16:33,341
Hooper. You idiot. Starboard!
Ain't you watchin' it!

764
01:16:37,349 --> 01:16:38,973
Hooper. Neutral.

765
01:16:46,149 --> 01:16:47,608
Where'd he go now?

766
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:50,402
He ain't foolin' me.

767
01:16:51,571 --> 01:16:53,315
What's he yankin' on now?

768
01:16:54,533 --> 01:16:55,943
Go on. Try it.

769
01:17:08,713 --> 01:17:11,750
I don't know. Chief.
If he's very smart or very dumb.

770
01:17:18,807 --> 01:17:19,922
Jesus...

771
01:17:23,687 --> 01:17:25,145
He's gone under.

772
01:17:25,355 --> 01:17:28,724
He's gone under the boat.
I think he's gone under the boat.

773
01:17:29,943 --> 01:17:31,485
Yeah. It's too easy.

774
01:17:31,611 --> 01:17:34,815
He is a smart. Big fish.
He's gone under the boat.

775
01:17:35,365 --> 01:17:38,615
Keep her steady. Now.
I got somethin' very big.

776
01:17:38,827 --> 01:17:40,238
I don't think so.

777
01:17:41,413 --> 01:17:43,370
Chief. Put your gloves on.

778
01:17:44,166 --> 01:17:46,407
You put your gloves on. Both of you.

779
01:17:49,212 --> 01:17:51,252
Getting ready to run out again.

780
01:17:52,007 --> 01:17:53,667
Quint. Let it go.

781
01:17:54,759 --> 01:17:57,630
You may be big in the lab.
But out here you're just cargo.

782
01:17:57,721 --> 01:18:00,591
If you don't want to backstroke home.
You get down here.

783
01:18:00,682 --> 01:18:03,636
You don't want to listen to me.
Don't listen to me.

784
01:18:03,727 --> 01:18:07,060
- It's not a shark.
- The wire's showing!

785
01:18:07,147 --> 01:18:08,392
Unbuckle me.

786
01:18:09,524 --> 01:18:12,976
- Get the other side.
- It's a tuna or swordfish.

787
01:18:15,864 --> 01:18:17,192
Take this rod.

788
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:20,691
- Give the Chief a hand. Will you?
- Right!

789
01:18:31,546 --> 01:18:34,084
It's a marlin or a stingray...

790
01:18:34,883 --> 01:18:37,089
...but it's definitely a game fish.

791
01:18:48,855 --> 01:18:50,480
Gamin' fish?

792
01:18:50,941 --> 01:18:53,977
Marlin. Stingray bit
through this piano wire?

793
01:18:54,277 --> 01:18:56,317
Don't you tell me my business again.

794
01:18:56,404 --> 01:19:00,023
- You get back on the bridge.
- Quint. That doesn't prove a damn thing.

795
01:19:00,116 --> 01:19:01,659
It proves one thing.

796
01:19:01,785 --> 01:19:05,485
It proves that you wealthy college boys
don't have the education enough...

797
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:07,372
...to admit when you're wrong.

798
01:19:16,716 --> 01:19:19,386
What's the point? Hooks and lines?

799
01:19:21,930 --> 01:19:24,386
You lose one. You rig one.

800
01:19:28,937 --> 01:19:31,558
Twelve minutes. South. Southeast. Now.
Full throttle.

801
01:19:31,648 --> 01:19:33,142
Aye. Aye. Sir.

802
01:19:35,235 --> 01:19:38,521
You see. What I do. Chief.
Is I trick 'em to the surface.

803
01:19:38,947 --> 01:19:40,489
And then jab at 'em.

804
01:19:40,949 --> 01:19:44,318
I'm not gonna haul 'em up
like a lot of catfish.

805
01:19:45,287 --> 01:19:46,366
Full throttle.

806
01:19:46,454 --> 01:19:49,076
I don't have to take this abuse
much longer.

807
01:19:49,416 --> 01:19:52,251
Your head's bleeding. First aid there.

808
01:20:19,947 --> 01:20:22,154
Start that chum line again. Will ya?

809
01:20:24,952 --> 01:20:26,660
Let Hooper take a turn.

810
01:20:26,954 --> 01:20:29,326
Hooper drives the boat.

811
01:20:44,597 --> 01:20:46,636
Stop playin' with yourself. Hooper.

812
01:20:46,724 --> 01:20:48,598
Slow ahead. If you please.

813
01:20:49,435 --> 01:20:51,262
You heard him. Slow ahead.

814
01:21:00,363 --> 01:21:01,608
Slow ahead.

815
01:21:02,031 --> 01:21:06,243
I can go slow ahead. Come on down
and chum some of this shit.

816
01:21:23,386 --> 01:21:25,462
You're gonna need a bigger boat.

817
01:21:40,987 --> 01:21:42,647
Shut off that engine.

818
01:22:10,516 --> 01:22:13,186
- That's a 20-footer.
- 25.

819
01:22:14,228 --> 01:22:15,687
Three tons of him.

820
01:22:21,194 --> 01:22:23,566
We're gonna need a bigger boat. Right?

821
01:22:23,863 --> 01:22:25,322
Gotta get to work.

822
01:22:25,531 --> 01:22:27,156
How do we handle this?

823
01:22:27,950 --> 01:22:30,157
Come up front. Martin. I need you.

824
01:22:31,996 --> 01:22:33,704
He's circling the boat.

825
01:22:47,136 --> 01:22:50,920
Amity Point Light Station to Orca.
This is Amity Point Light Station to Orca.

826
01:22:51,015 --> 01:22:52,213
Come in, Orca.

827
01:22:53,184 --> 01:22:56,635
- Orca. Come in.
- I have Mrs. Martin Brody here.

828
01:22:56,812 --> 01:22:57,927
Put her on.

829
01:22:58,773 --> 01:23:01,690
- Come on. Martin! Move!
- I'm not goin' out there!

830
01:23:01,859 --> 01:23:06,486
Beyond the edge of the barrels.
Go to the end of the barrels. Further out.

831
01:23:06,781 --> 01:23:07,979
- Further out.
- Why?

832
01:23:08,074 --> 01:23:09,568
- Go further out.
- What for?

833
01:23:09,659 --> 01:23:11,568
Will you go to the end of the pulpit?

834
01:23:11,661 --> 01:23:13,903
- What?
- Will you go to the end of the pulpit?

835
01:23:13,996 --> 01:23:16,950
I need something
in the foreground to give it some scale.

836
01:23:17,041 --> 01:23:18,156
Foreground my ass!

837
01:23:18,251 --> 01:23:21,417
Your husband's okay. He's fishin'.
He just caught some stripers.

838
01:23:21,504 --> 01:23:23,496
We'll bring 'em for dinner.
We won't be long.

839
01:23:23,589 --> 01:23:25,498
We ain't seen anything yet. Over. Out.

840
01:23:25,716 --> 01:23:27,958
- I'm not staying here!
- I'm begging you!

841
01:23:28,052 --> 01:23:29,380
Goddamn it!

842
01:23:29,846 --> 01:23:31,838
Come here. Come here. Darlin'.

843
01:23:37,478 --> 01:23:40,313
I want you up on the bridge.
Just take her forward. Steady.

844
01:23:40,398 --> 01:23:44,645
- I've never steered a boat in my life.
- Just watch my hand. Take her steady.

845
01:23:45,319 --> 01:23:48,024
Attach the end of this line to the first keg.

846
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:51,907
I've got to get a good shot
at that porker's head.

847
01:24:10,928 --> 01:24:12,506
Get clear of the bow.

848
01:24:17,101 --> 01:24:19,722
- Hurry up. Will ya?
- Your turn. Quint.

849
01:24:20,396 --> 01:24:21,974
Hooper. Where are you?

850
01:24:25,902 --> 01:24:27,728
Hurry it up now. Tie it on.

851
01:24:29,197 --> 01:24:31,604
He's comin' straight for us!
Don't screw up now.

852
01:24:31,699 --> 01:24:33,158
Don't wait for me.

853
01:24:35,745 --> 01:24:38,746
Come on. Hooper. Come on.
Hurry it up. Tie it on.

854
01:24:39,582 --> 01:24:40,910
Now. Now.

855
01:24:44,754 --> 01:24:45,999
Kill it!

856
01:24:47,131 --> 01:24:47,961
Now!

857
01:24:50,092 --> 01:24:51,207
Shoot!

858
01:24:54,514 --> 01:24:55,509
Time.

859
01:24:57,350 --> 01:25:01,430
What were you doin'. Anyway?
I didn't get a clean shot right in the head.

860
01:25:01,979 --> 01:25:05,064
Let's see how long that barrel takes
to bring him up.

861
01:25:06,609 --> 01:25:09,812
Free another barrel.
I'm comin' around again.

862
01:26:03,666 --> 01:26:05,575
What do we do now? We're quittin'. Right?

863
01:26:05,668 --> 01:26:09,666
We got one barrel on him.
We stay out here until we find him again.

864
01:26:10,006 --> 01:26:12,164
We could radio in and get a bigger boat...

865
01:26:37,783 --> 01:26:39,942
Don't you worry about it. Chief.

866
01:26:40,828 --> 01:26:42,453
It won't be permanent.

867
01:26:42,622 --> 01:26:44,863
You want to see something permanent?

868
01:26:51,339 --> 01:26:54,126
You want to feel somethin' permanent?

869
01:26:55,343 --> 01:26:58,961
Just put your hand underneath my cap.
You feel that little lump?

870
01:26:59,430 --> 01:27:02,348
Knocko Nolans. St. Paddy's Day. Boston.

871
01:27:06,938 --> 01:27:08,348
I got that beat.

872
01:27:16,531 --> 01:27:17,941
It's a moray eel.

873
01:27:18,824 --> 01:27:20,983
It bit right through my wet suit.

874
01:27:22,954 --> 01:27:26,204
I don't know about that.
But I entered an arm wrestlin' contest...

875
01:27:26,290 --> 01:27:28,828
...in an Oakie bar in San Francisco.
See this?

876
01:27:28,918 --> 01:27:31,124
I can't extend that. You know why?

877
01:27:31,379 --> 01:27:33,206
'Cause in the semi-final...

878
01:27:33,548 --> 01:27:35,789
...celebrating my third wife's demise...

879
01:27:35,883 --> 01:27:39,003
...big Chinese fella. He pulled me right over.

880
01:27:51,357 --> 01:27:52,555
Look at that.

881
01:27:54,485 --> 01:27:56,027
That's a bull shark.

882
01:27:56,404 --> 01:27:58,895
He scraped me when I was takin' samples.

883
01:27:59,949 --> 01:28:01,657
I got something for you.

884
01:28:02,451 --> 01:28:05,536
There's a thresher.
You see that? A thresher's tail.

885
01:28:06,163 --> 01:28:07,990
- Thresher?
- It's a shark.

886
01:28:11,002 --> 01:28:14,121
- You want a drink? Drink to your leg?
- I'll drink to your leg.

887
01:28:14,213 --> 01:28:16,372
So we drink to our legs.

888
01:28:21,679 --> 01:28:24,680
I got the crime de la crime.
Right here. Hold on.

889
01:28:26,058 --> 01:28:27,553
Here. You see that?

890
01:28:28,102 --> 01:28:29,846
You're wearin' a sweater.

891
01:28:30,605 --> 01:28:32,681
Right there. Mary Ellen Moffit.

892
01:28:34,233 --> 01:28:35,692
She broke my heart.

893
01:28:46,245 --> 01:28:47,621
What's that one?

894
01:28:47,830 --> 01:28:50,617
- What?
- That one. There. On your arm.

895
01:28:53,461 --> 01:28:55,453
A tattoo. I got that removed.

896
01:28:56,172 --> 01:28:59,007
Don't tell me. Don't tell me. "Mother."

897
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:06,009
What is it?

898
01:29:11,270 --> 01:29:13,393
That's the U.S.S. Indianapolis.

899
01:29:21,739 --> 01:29:23,696
You were on the Indianapolis?

900
01:29:23,866 --> 01:29:25,147
What happened?

901
01:29:27,036 --> 01:29:31,248
Japanese submarine slammed
two torpedoes into her side. Chief.

902
01:29:32,625 --> 01:29:35,958
I was comin' back
from the island of Tinian to Leyte...

903
01:29:36,045 --> 01:29:39,165
...just delivered the bomb.
The Hiroshima bomb.

904
01:29:42,677 --> 01:29:45,084
1.100 men went into the water.

905
01:29:45,346 --> 01:29:47,422
Vessel went down in 12 minutes.

906
01:29:49,851 --> 01:29:52,768
Didn't see the first shark
for about half an hour.

907
01:29:52,979 --> 01:29:54,770
Tiger. 13-footer.

908
01:29:54,856 --> 01:29:57,773
Know how you know that
when you're in the water?

909
01:29:57,859 --> 01:30:00,694
You tell by lookin'
from the dorsal to the tail.

910
01:30:02,864 --> 01:30:04,488
Well. We didn't know.

911
01:30:05,116 --> 01:30:07,821
Because our bomb mission
had been so secret...

912
01:30:08,911 --> 01:30:11,367
...no distress signal had been sent.

913
01:30:18,045 --> 01:30:20,667
They didn't even list us overdue
for a week.

914
01:30:22,466 --> 01:30:25,633
Very first light. Sharks come cruisin'...

915
01:30:26,470 --> 01:30:29,092
...so we formed ourselves
into tight groups.

916
01:30:31,267 --> 01:30:34,600
Kinda like old squares in a battle
like you see on a calendar...

917
01:30:34,687 --> 01:30:36,347
...like the Battle of Waterloo.

918
01:30:36,439 --> 01:30:39,108
The idea was.
The shark comes to the nearest man...

919
01:30:39,192 --> 01:30:42,062
...and he starts poundin'
hollerin' and screamin'.

920
01:30:42,153 --> 01:30:44,145
Sometimes the shark would go away...

921
01:30:46,073 --> 01:30:47,983
...but sometimes he wouldn't go away.

922
01:30:48,075 --> 01:30:50,863
Sometimes that shark.
He looks right into you...

923
01:30:50,953 --> 01:30:52,661
...right into your eyes.

924
01:30:53,748 --> 01:30:56,369
You know. A thing about a shark. He's got...

925
01:30:56,709 --> 01:30:58,120
...lifeless eyes.

926
01:30:58,502 --> 01:31:00,875
Black eyes. Like a doll's eyes.

927
01:31:02,465 --> 01:31:05,585
When he comes at you.
He doesn't seem to be livin'...

928
01:31:06,093 --> 01:31:07,753
...until he bites you.

929
01:31:08,012 --> 01:31:11,013
Those little black eyes
roll over white and then...

930
01:31:12,975 --> 01:31:16,142
...then you hear
that terrible high-pitched screamin'.

931
01:31:16,646 --> 01:31:18,270
The ocean turns red...

932
01:31:18,981 --> 01:31:22,599
...in spite of the poundin' and the hollerin'.
They all come in.

933
01:31:24,445 --> 01:31:26,153
They rip you to pieces.

934
01:31:30,993 --> 01:31:33,567
You know. By the end of that first dawn...

935
01:31:35,248 --> 01:31:36,742
...we lost 100 men.

936
01:31:38,376 --> 01:31:40,701
I don't know how many sharks.
Maybe 1.000.

937
01:31:40,795 --> 01:31:43,879
I don't know how many men.
They averaged six an hour.

938
01:31:44,715 --> 01:31:47,420
On Thursday mornin'.
I bumped into a friend of mine...

939
01:31:47,510 --> 01:31:49,668
...Herbie Robinson. From Cleveland.

940
01:31:51,222 --> 01:31:53,677
Baseball player. Bosun's mate.

941
01:31:56,185 --> 01:31:57,893
I thought he was asleep.

942
01:31:58,688 --> 01:32:00,597
Reached over to wake him up.

943
01:32:01,691 --> 01:32:05,190
He bobbed up and down
in the water just like a kind of top.

944
01:32:06,153 --> 01:32:07,352
Upended.

945
01:32:11,534 --> 01:32:14,239
He'd been bitten in half. Below the waist.

946
01:32:18,082 --> 01:32:22,080
Noon the fifth day.
A Lockheed Ventura saw us.

947
01:32:22,169 --> 01:32:25,005
He swung in low and he saw us.
He was a young pilot.

948
01:32:25,089 --> 01:32:27,046
Younger than Mr. Hooper. He saw us...

949
01:32:27,133 --> 01:32:29,458
...and he came in low.
And three hours later...

950
01:32:29,552 --> 01:32:32,837
...a big fat PBY comes down
and starts to pick us up.

951
01:32:33,139 --> 01:32:36,093
That was the time I was most frightened.

952
01:32:36,726 --> 01:32:38,469
Waitin' for my turn.

953
01:32:39,854 --> 01:32:42,226
I'll never put on a life jacket again.

954
01:32:44,650 --> 01:32:46,892
So. 1.100 men went into the water...

955
01:32:47,653 --> 01:32:49,361
...316 men come out.

956
01:32:49,447 --> 01:32:53,279
The sharks took the rest
June the 29th. 1945.

957
01:32:56,495 --> 01:33:00,114
Anyway. We delivered the bomb.

958
01:33:12,511 --> 01:33:13,674
What's that?

959
01:33:14,722 --> 01:33:16,002
It's a whale.

960
01:33:17,975 --> 01:33:22,388
"Farewell and adieu to you.
Fair Spanish ladies

961
01:33:24,273 --> 01:33:28,982
"Farewell and adieu. You ladies of Spain"

962
01:33:33,699 --> 01:33:37,567
"Show me the way to go home

963
01:33:38,996 --> 01:33:43,124
"I'm tired and I want to go to bed

964
01:33:44,544 --> 01:33:49,205
"I had a little drink about an hour ago

965
01:33:49,674 --> 01:33:53,754
"And it's gone right to my head

966
01:33:54,929 --> 01:33:58,927
"Wherever I may roam

967
01:33:59,934 --> 01:34:03,979
"By land. Or sea. Or foam

968
01:34:14,991 --> 01:34:18,027
"Show me the way to go home

969
01:34:18,452 --> 01:34:21,537
"I'm tired and I want to go to bed

970
01:34:21,664 --> 01:34:24,237
"I had a little drink about a hour ago

971
01:34:24,333 --> 01:34:26,789
"And it's gone right to my head

972
01:34:26,878 --> 01:34:29,166
"Wherever I may roam

973
01:34:29,589 --> 01:34:31,877
"On land or sea or foam

974
01:34:32,008 --> 01:34:35,341
"You can always hear me singing this..."

975
01:34:38,556 --> 01:34:40,098
Start the engines.

976
01:34:50,109 --> 01:34:51,307
Fire her up!

977
01:34:59,994 --> 01:35:01,785
Put out the fire. Will ya?

978
01:35:11,464 --> 01:35:13,124
- Pump her out.
- Done.

979
01:35:21,891 --> 01:35:24,263
- Everybody on deck.
- He ate the light.

980
01:35:24,352 --> 01:35:25,929
- Terrific.
- Excuse me.

981
01:35:28,481 --> 01:35:31,435
Quint. What are you doing?
Don't waste your time.

982
01:35:32,985 --> 01:35:34,693
What's wrong with this?

983
01:35:37,073 --> 01:35:40,905
Hooper. Take the wheel.
Brody. Follow that. Watch for him.

984
01:35:58,636 --> 01:35:59,964
You okay?

985
01:36:02,056 --> 01:36:03,087
You okay?

986
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:29,826
More left rudder.

987
01:36:30,710 --> 01:36:32,204
Pull your left hand down.

988
01:36:32,295 --> 01:36:35,212
I can't. It'll only go about three inches.

989
01:36:35,339 --> 01:36:39,123
All of our injectors got scored
from the salt water in the fuel.

990
01:36:40,219 --> 01:36:42,793
Yeah. The housing's bent. You can hear it.

991
01:36:43,639 --> 01:36:48,100
Try the left rudder again. More left.
Good. Once again now.

992
01:36:52,189 --> 01:36:53,388
There it is.

993
01:36:53,733 --> 01:36:55,441
What do you say. Chief?

994
01:36:55,651 --> 01:36:58,225
The barrel is up. It's right in the stern.

995
01:37:02,033 --> 01:37:05,449
I think he's right under the keg.
Grab the boat hook.

996
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,833
If we can get close enough...

997
01:37:20,843 --> 01:37:25,552
...I've got things on board that'll kill it.
- Just want to goose him up. Come on.

998
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:40,811
When he runs. You drop that rope
or you'll lose your hands.

999
01:37:42,490 --> 01:37:46,737
I've seen fingers torn out at the knuckles.
Whole sea's bones. Full of 'em.

1000
01:37:47,161 --> 01:37:48,869
Give it to me a minute.

1001
01:38:04,262 --> 01:38:06,753
Haul in that line or it'll foul us.

1002
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:09,099
Start the engine.

1003
01:38:11,102 --> 01:38:14,305
- Where are you goin'?
- I'm gonna make a phone call.

1004
01:38:21,028 --> 01:38:23,484
Hello. Mayday. Orca. Coast Guard?

1005
01:38:24,740 --> 01:38:27,029
Coast Guard. This is the Orca.
Do you read me?

1006
01:38:27,118 --> 01:38:29,609
Coast Guard. This is the Orca. Do you...

1007
01:38:35,710 --> 01:38:37,252
Excuse me. Chief.

1008
01:38:37,837 --> 01:38:42,380
That's great. That's just great.
Now. Where the hell are we?

1009
01:38:44,468 --> 01:38:48,252
You're certifiable. Quint.
You know that? You're certifiable.

1010
01:38:48,389 --> 01:38:51,509
- You're certifiable. But I'll tell you this!
- Boys.

1011
01:38:53,352 --> 01:38:56,187
I think he's come back for his noon feeding.

1012
01:38:57,356 --> 01:38:59,100
Hook me up another barrel.

1013
01:39:29,805 --> 01:39:31,632
Bring her around after him.

1014
01:39:48,491 --> 01:39:50,898
Full throttle.
Get me right up alongside of him.

1015
01:39:50,993 --> 01:39:54,279
I can't rev it up that high.
It's not gonna take it.

1016
01:40:12,223 --> 01:40:13,800
Five degrees port.

1017
01:40:20,815 --> 01:40:22,724
All right. Hold your course.

1018
01:40:28,948 --> 01:40:30,905
Five degrees port now.

1019
01:40:34,412 --> 01:40:35,822
Hold your course.

1020
01:40:37,665 --> 01:40:39,492
- Fast fish.
- Watch my hand.

1021
01:40:41,043 --> 01:40:44,459
Be sure you watch my hand.
Follow me. Follow me.

1022
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:48,627
Lad. You watch him now.
Starboard. Starboard.

1023
01:40:49,802 --> 01:40:51,047
Run him down.

1024
01:40:58,894 --> 01:41:00,223
Hard aport.

1025
01:41:03,816 --> 01:41:04,812
Watch him.

1026
01:41:04,900 --> 01:41:06,063
Starboard.

1027
01:41:30,509 --> 01:41:33,843
I can't believe it.
Two barrels and he's going down again.

1028
01:41:39,310 --> 01:41:40,721
It's incredible.

1029
01:41:46,984 --> 01:41:48,893
- They're up again!
- Now what?

1030
01:41:57,954 --> 01:42:02,200
Why don't we lead the shark into shore
instead of him leading us out to sea?

1031
01:42:06,796 --> 01:42:08,504
Grab a couple of poles.

1032
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:12,923
Hang on now. We're going around.

1033
01:42:13,594 --> 01:42:16,085
Into starboard. Easy.

1034
01:42:17,056 --> 01:42:20,674
I'm gonna back her off now.
Keep a watch on it. Boys. Watch him.

1035
01:42:25,690 --> 01:42:27,729
All right. Gentlemen. Snag them.

1036
01:42:33,239 --> 01:42:35,777
Now then tie them to the stern cleats.

1037
01:42:38,786 --> 01:42:41,407
Brody. Bring your end around the cleat.

1038
01:42:42,164 --> 01:42:45,616
That's right. It'll lock itself off.
Give him room. Brody.

1039
01:42:47,503 --> 01:42:49,211
Stay clear of the line.

1040
01:42:57,346 --> 01:42:59,054
Watch it. Stand clear.

1041
01:43:09,108 --> 01:43:11,777
Stand away from those stern cleats.

1042
01:43:24,832 --> 01:43:26,825
Back home we got a taxidermy man.

1043
01:43:26,917 --> 01:43:30,251
He gonna have a heart attack
when he sees what I brought him.

1044
01:43:37,219 --> 01:43:40,304
Throttle back. You're losing the cleats.

1045
01:43:42,475 --> 01:43:45,144
My God. This one. Too. They're both going.

1046
01:43:45,478 --> 01:43:49,807
- He's eating his way through that line.
- He's working his way right up to us.

1047
01:43:50,441 --> 01:43:52,897
Come on. Quint. Hurry!

1048
01:43:54,862 --> 01:43:56,107
Out of my way.

1049
01:44:01,369 --> 01:44:02,400
Watch it.

1050
01:44:06,457 --> 01:44:09,030
Untie this. He'll pull out the transom.

1051
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:14,209
Make it fast.

1052
01:44:15,216 --> 01:44:17,173
I can't. It's trying to run.

1053
01:44:20,096 --> 01:44:22,053
Pull. You son of a bitch!

1054
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:26,972
Go ahead. Pull your bloody heart out.

1055
01:44:33,734 --> 01:44:35,145
It's impossible!

1056
01:44:51,669 --> 01:44:53,708
We're breaking up! Cut it!

1057
01:44:55,172 --> 01:44:56,583
Watch your hands!

1058
01:44:57,591 --> 01:44:59,668
Cut it quick. I can't hold it!

1059
01:45:20,990 --> 01:45:23,398
He can't stay down
with three barrels on him.

1060
01:45:23,492 --> 01:45:25,651
Not with three barrels. He can't.

1061
01:45:25,911 --> 01:45:27,406
What about us?

1062
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:31,957
Get the pump out of the locker
in front of you. Will you?

1063
01:45:32,043 --> 01:45:33,585
We're gonna sink. Aren't we?

1064
01:45:33,669 --> 01:45:36,421
Keep an eye on the barrels.
Pump it out. Chief.

1065
01:45:43,095 --> 01:45:44,637
Starting to go under.

1066
01:45:45,264 --> 01:45:48,301
He can't with three barrels on him.
Not with three he can't.

1067
01:46:23,135 --> 01:46:25,294
You ever have one do this before?

1068
01:46:27,682 --> 01:46:28,713
No.

1069
01:47:00,298 --> 01:47:02,504
He's chasin' us. I don't believe it.

1070
01:47:08,472 --> 01:47:10,679
I'm gonna draw him into the shallows.

1071
01:47:10,766 --> 01:47:14,681
Draw him into the shallow water.
I'm gonna draw him in and drown him.

1072
01:47:15,104 --> 01:47:17,512
- We're headin' in. Brody.
- Thank Christ!

1073
01:47:25,323 --> 01:47:27,814
- You ever had a great white do that?
- No.

1074
01:47:34,123 --> 01:47:35,866
How far do we have to go?

1075
01:47:38,753 --> 01:47:41,326
Don't put that much pressure on it.

1076
01:47:51,349 --> 01:47:54,219
- Goddamn it.
- Shut up. Get back there.

1077
01:47:59,940 --> 01:48:00,936
Hold on.

1078
01:48:16,165 --> 01:48:20,708
"Farewell and adieu to you.
Fair Spanish ladies

1079
01:48:23,631 --> 01:48:28,507
"Farewell and adieu. You ladies of Spain

1080
01:48:30,054 --> 01:48:34,134
"For we received order
for to sail back to Boston"

1081
01:48:35,601 --> 01:48:38,009
You idiot. You burned out the bearings.

1082
01:48:39,689 --> 01:48:43,104
All right stop the boat. Stop the boat.
Stop it.

1083
01:50:21,875 --> 01:50:24,876
What exactly can you do
with these things of yours?

1084
01:50:29,091 --> 01:50:33,171
I think I can pump 20 cc
of strychnine nitrate into him.

1085
01:50:33,637 --> 01:50:35,428
If I can get close enough.

1086
01:50:38,350 --> 01:50:40,841
Get this little needle through his skin?

1087
01:50:42,771 --> 01:50:44,349
No. I can't do that.

1088
01:50:45,774 --> 01:50:48,894
If I can get him close to the cage.
I can get him in the mouth.

1089
01:50:48,986 --> 01:50:52,853
- That shark'll rip that cage to pieces.
- You got any better suggestions?

1090
01:51:18,807 --> 01:51:19,838
Easy.

1091
01:51:22,352 --> 01:51:23,550
Up she goes.

1092
01:52:18,617 --> 01:52:20,076
Ain't got no spit.

1093
01:52:35,425 --> 01:52:37,916
Try and keep him off me until I'm lower.

1094
01:52:40,722 --> 01:52:42,347
Okay. Okay. I'm ready.

1095
01:55:38,650 --> 01:55:42,351
Bring him up. Goddamn it.
Bring him up now!

1096
01:55:47,951 --> 01:55:49,695
Pull it up. Pull it.

1097
01:56:00,255 --> 01:56:02,414
Come on. Quint. Bring him in.

1098
01:56:05,594 --> 01:56:06,969
It's giving way.

1099
01:56:18,982 --> 01:56:20,856
Rig something!

1100
01:56:24,321 --> 01:56:25,317
Got it?

1101
01:56:29,284 --> 01:56:30,482
It's comin'.

1102
01:56:33,121 --> 01:56:34,070
Slower.

1103
01:59:49,151 --> 01:59:50,693
Show me the tank.

1104
02:00:09,087 --> 02:00:10,118
Blow up!

1105
02:00:13,592 --> 02:00:15,335
Smile. You son of a bitch!

1106
02:01:44,683 --> 02:01:45,762
Quint?

1107
02:01:47,019 --> 02:01:48,098
No.

1108
02:01:57,529 --> 02:01:59,237
Can we get in on those?

1109
02:02:05,996 --> 02:02:07,407
What day is this?

1110
02:02:09,583 --> 02:02:12,204
It's Wednesday. It's Tuesday. I think.

1111
02:02:13,879 --> 02:02:15,706
I think the tide's with us.

1112
02:02:16,631 --> 02:02:18,090
Keep kicking.

1113
02:02:21,511 --> 02:02:23,255
I used to hate the water.

1114
02:02:25,849 --> 02:02:27,391
I can't imagine why.
