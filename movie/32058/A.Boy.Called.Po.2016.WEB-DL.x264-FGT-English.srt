1
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:35,215
- Po.

2
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:41,887
Hey, Po.

3
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:44,656
- Where's mommy?

4
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,827
Uh oh, it's dinnertime, daddy.

5
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:53,832
Come on.

6
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,626
- Po, Po, hey, it's okay.

7
00:04:20,628 --> 00:04:21,460
It's okay.

8
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:22,694
- No, no!

9
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,429
- Soft touch bad,
hard touch good.

10
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,264
Come on, I got you.

11
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:26,331
- No, no!

12
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,134
- No, it's okay,
it's okay, yeah.

13
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,305
Okay, daddy's got you.

14
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:35,140
Yeah, yeah, daddy's got you.

15
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:36,341
- Daddy's got me.

16
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:38,910
- Shh, that's right,
daddy's got ya.

17
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:39,845
- Daddy's got me.

18
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:40,979
- Daddy's got ya.

19
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:47,686
Something funny?

20
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:49,588
- Daddy's a wrastler.

21
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,291
- Yeah, yeah, very funny.

22
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:53,792
- Watch out wrastler!

23
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,460
- Yeah, you want the wrastler?

24
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,362
You want the wrastler?

25
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:00,499
Take that, wrastler!

26
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,037
- It is the fifth straight
day of losses for the s&p 500.

27
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,608
That's the longest losing
streak in 13 months' time.

28
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,644
- Bloombergs is the
professional's choice.

29
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:13,845
Listen to Po.

30
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:16,014
- Po, I can't stay up all night.

31
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,382
You have to go to bed.

32
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:21,286
- Wall street journal.

33
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:23,021
- Record on
December 29, you see there

34
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:24,723
what crude oil is
doing right now,

35
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:26,591
still trading
below $50 a barrel,

36
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:28,994
and expanding those profits.

37
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:33,765
- Oh, this one's for later.

38
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,182
- Ew.

39
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,088
What did you do?

40
00:05:58,725 --> 00:05:59,725
Oh, Po.

41
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:18,076
- It's the rainbow, dad.

42
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,613
- Why is it on the wall, Po?

43
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,815
- It's your rainbow.

44
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:25,650
- Okay, Po, new rule.

45
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:28,787
No food on the walls, okay?

46
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,690
No food on the walls.

47
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:33,959
All right, come on.

48
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:37,863
Let's go get some sponges
and clean this up.

49
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:39,598
- It's your rainbow.

50
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,834
Your rainbow, daddy.

51
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:49,174
- Hey, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

52
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:51,076
Come with me, come on.

53
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:02,554
Here you go.

54
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,690
- Autograph, please.

55
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,361
- Why are we doing
this everyday?

56
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:11,096
- Autograph, please.

57
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:16,101
- Well, I am honored
to be the sole member

58
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,736
of your autograph
collection, Po.

59
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:19,004
- Mac and cheese, please.

60
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:21,440
- No, we don't have Mac
and cheese today, buddy.

61
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:23,942
- Calcium's good for your bones.

62
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:27,012
- Yeah, well, this is
peanut butter and jelly

63
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:30,582
which is known for it's simplicity
and budgetary properties.

64
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:31,616
What happened to your face?

65
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:32,818
- Mac and cheese, please.

66
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,588
- No, Po, you have
to eat your sandwich.

67
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,024
No, I am not doing this today.

68
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:40,959
- Patrick's a nice
name for a boy,

69
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,427
but I think I'll call you Po.

70
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:45,697
- You need to eat your sandwich.

71
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:46,898
- Where's mommy?

72
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,333
- Fine, you don't wanna
eat it, I'll eat it.

73
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:51,236
Mm, mm, oh, what a delicious,

74
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:55,440
turns out dad makes a
mean Pb and j sandwich.

75
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:57,576
- Don't be afraid, daddy.

76
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,147
- Afraid of what, Po?

77
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:10,021
- Yuck!

78
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:11,023
- Yuck.

79
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,527
- Mac and cheese, please.

80
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:18,864
- The capital city
of Mississippi is?

81
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:19,866
Anyone?

82
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:22,701
Patrick.

83
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:26,204
Po?

84
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,243
Can you tell us what the
capital city of Mississippi is?

85
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:34,246
- Hey, spaceman, the teacher
asked you a question.

86
00:08:34,248 --> 00:08:35,814
- Taylor, stop it.

87
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,351
- You know the answer,
don't you, Patrick?

88
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:43,655
- M-i-s-s-i-s-s-i-p-p-i.

89
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:44,489
- What an idiot.

90
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:46,057
- Stop it, Taylor.

91
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:50,295
You know the answer, don't you?

92
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,531
Po?

93
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,003
It's Jackson, isn't it?

94
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:03,808
So, the capital city
of Mississippi is?

95
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,043
- Jackson.

96
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,912
- Right, now can anybody tell me

97
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:08,613
the capital of Alabama?

98
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:09,447
- Good morning.

99
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:10,449
- Morning.

100
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:15,720
How we lookin'?

101
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,289
- Oh, we're great.

102
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,557
We've increased lift by 20%,

103
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,125
but she still won't
get off the ground.

104
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,526
- It's the weight
of the batteries.

105
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:22,994
It is just too heavy, now.

106
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:24,262
- Well we can't go any
bigger with the wing size.

107
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:27,032
We may need a new
design altogether.

108
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:29,034
- Maybe fewer seats.

109
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:31,116
- That's a deal-breaker,
it's a 90-passenger minimum.

110
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,505
- David, Randall
needs to speak with you

111
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:34,706
in his office right away.

112
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,641
- Yeah, I'll be right there.

113
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:44,616
Be right back.

114
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,367
- May I sit here?

115
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:08,406
Everything in the world
is not in these books,

116
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:09,908
but it's a start.

117
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:12,911
I'm on mollusk.

118
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:15,981
Shellfish, you know,
bottom feeders.

119
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,618
Oh, I'm Amelia, by the way.

120
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,885
Amelia Carr.

121
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,053
I've moved here all
the way from London

122
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:24,322
and I have two daddies.

123
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:27,292
Pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

124
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,462
Patrick, is it?

125
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,130
- Patrick is a nice
name for a boy,

126
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,766
but I think I'll call you Po.

127
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:36,901
- Hm, a nickname.

128
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:39,738
I'm not there yet, still on m.

129
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,973
I have an aunt Constance
who we call ac,

130
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:45,443
but that's more of an
acronym than a nickname.

131
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:46,411
- Hey!

132
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:49,080
I say you could sit down?

133
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:50,949
- Friends of yours?

134
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:52,917
- You need to ask my permission.

135
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,653
- I must tell you,

136
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:56,454
even though we're
just in sixth grade,

137
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:58,857
people will judge us
by the company we keep.

138
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:02,527
- I think the spaceman's
trying to fly away.

139
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,932
What's wrong with you, freak?

140
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:12,604
Look at you, you
won't even fight back.

141
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:22,847
I guess today's your lucky day.

142
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,989
- I think you handled
that very nicely.

143
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:47,072
Po, I do believe we are
going to get along famously.

144
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:52,477
- This plane is going to
change the game forever.

145
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:54,879
One month, you buy me one month,

146
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,916
and you'll see her
fly, I promise.

147
00:11:57,918 --> 00:12:00,618
- All right, I'll
see what I can do.

148
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,554
But if you don't deliver,

149
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:03,955
I'll be forced to
scrap the project,

150
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:06,257
and you will be let go.

151
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:07,592
- I understand.

152
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:18,169
- Moving numbers.

153
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:19,671
- What's that buddy?

154
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:22,307
- Can you find the pattern?

155
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:24,142
- Po, get some sleep.

156
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:27,512
- Good night, daddy.

157
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:29,914
- Good night, buddy.

158
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,454
- Dancing numbers.

159
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,798
- You know what I just realized?

160
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,233
- What's that?

161
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:50,502
- You're the second
smartest person I know.

162
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:57,342
- All right, who's the first?

163
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,883
What if I can't do this, Ben?

164
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,519
All the promises I made?

165
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:09,788
They will dead cap this
entire program, and then what?

166
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,923
What am I gonna do?

167
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:13,691
We spent all of our
savings, and then some,

168
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:14,759
on Beth's medical bills.

169
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:16,828
I have Po's expenses, I,

170
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,398
this has to work.

171
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,701
- What about your in-laws?

172
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,370
- It's complicated.

173
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,175
- Look, if it comes to it,

174
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:31,342
I could loan you some.

175
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:33,645
- No, no, come on, I'll manage.

176
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:34,647
It's okay.

177
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:36,281
- What am I saying?

178
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:37,749
I'm broke anyway.

179
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:41,085
It's the thought that
counts though, right?

180
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:42,887
- Not as much as
some coffee would.

181
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:43,889
- On it.

182
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:53,364
- Hello?

183
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:54,666
- Hi, Mr. Wilson.

184
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,701
I have Patrick in the
nurse's office again.

185
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:58,002
I think you should
come and pick him up.

186
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,205
- Uh, yeah, yeah, thanks.

187
00:14:00,207 --> 00:14:02,040
I'll be right there.

188
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,581
Hey, Cathy.

189
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:11,249
- Oh, hey, Mr. Wilson.

190
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:12,784
- Hey, Po.

191
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:13,785
How you doing, buddy?

192
00:14:13,787 --> 00:14:14,787
How's that knee?

193
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:16,788
- Bat transmission received.

194
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,823
- Patrick, I've told you
not to play with that.

195
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:21,326
He's obsessed with it.

196
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:23,528
- Amelia Carr is
on the letter m.

197
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,462
M for mollusks.

198
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:25,663
- Okay, come here, come here.

199
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:26,865
Let's sit down.

200
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,933
We're gonna leave in
just a minute, sweetie.

201
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:31,135
- Amelia Carr and I
get along famously.

202
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:32,370
- Yeah.

203
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,072
- The principal wants
to see you, Mr. Wilson.

204
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:36,674
- Okay, here, Po hold this.

205
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:38,810
I will be right back.

206
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:41,045
- I'll be right back.

207
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,549
- Come on, he slipped
and fell while playing?

208
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:45,783
Someone pushed him.

209
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:48,186
- They're kids, at that
age they roughhouse.

210
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:49,187
We can't stop it all.

211
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:50,355
- How 'bout most?

212
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:51,856
Or just some?

213
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:53,591
- My concern is that he's
making himself a target.

214
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,093
- Making himself?

215
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,996
Okay, he's different.

216
00:14:57,998 --> 00:14:59,564
- He's regressing.

217
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,432
Mr. Wilson,
Patrick's autism is...

218
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:02,800
- no, I know about his autism.

219
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:04,402
I know all about his autism.

220
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,637
I get all the reports.

221
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,071
I see the testing.

222
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,173
I pay for the therapy services.

223
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:10,775
I'm the one driving him
around the neighborhood

224
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:12,944
every night until
he falls asleep.

225
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:14,712
And you know what?

226
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:16,614
He won't even give me a hug.

227
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:18,917
My son won't give me a hug,

228
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,786
but that doesn't mean
I love him any less.

229
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:25,657
And all I'm asking of you is
that you don't give up on him.

230
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:28,493
- His language and communication,
his social behavior,

231
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:32,163
his responsiveness, he's
isolating himself more and more.

232
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:34,098
- All of which is
typical for a boy like Po

233
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,667
recovering from trauma.

234
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:38,403
- He isn't recovering,
he's getting worse.

235
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:40,471
And I'm quite concerned.

236
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:42,140
When we decided to
mainstream Patrick

237
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:44,809
he was in a very
different place.

238
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:47,345
Now, I think we need to consider
other schooling options.

239
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:48,546
- I've seen those other options.

240
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:50,048
You can forget it.

241
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,250
- The special ed program has
really improved recently,

242
00:15:52,252 --> 00:15:54,619
especially working with
children like your son.

243
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:58,790
- He has been reading since
he was three years old.

244
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,591
He seems to understand
math concepts

245
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:02,894
that I struggled with
in graduate school.

246
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:04,595
He doesn't need
special education.

247
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:07,098
He just needs the
regular old education

248
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,300
that you're supposed
to be providing him.

249
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,803
- He can't stay here
like this, Mr. Wilson.

250
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,938
He's simply not thriving.

251
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:38,930
- Hey, Po.

252
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:42,867
Po, Po, hey, come
here for a second.

253
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:43,935
- Okay.

254
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,673
- Listen to me, it is not okay

255
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:51,009
for other kids to
pick on you at school.

256
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:51,976
So daddy's gonna teach you,

257
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:54,879
hey, Po, Po, hey buddy, with me.

258
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:56,314
Daddy's gonna teach you

259
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:57,882
how to stand up for
yourself, you understand?

260
00:16:57,884 --> 00:16:58,716
- Stand up.

261
00:16:58,718 --> 00:16:59,951
- That's right!

262
00:16:59,953 --> 00:17:01,319
Okay, here, put
your hand in here.

263
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:02,220
Okay, oh, come here.

264
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:03,054
It's okay.

265
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:04,355
Hey, it's okay.

266
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,758
That goes in there, exactly.

267
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,396
Left hand, just like that.

268
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:14,632
Good.

269
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,000
- Red balloons.

270
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:17,668
- Okay, no, not red balloons,
not balloons, buddy.

271
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,003
Hey, look at me, look at me.

272
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:20,471
Right with me, okay.

273
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:22,306
Hands like this,
hands like this.

274
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:24,609
Nope, down, like
this, like this.

275
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:26,611
Hands like this.

276
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:28,679
Good, good, there we go.

277
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:31,616
Now, I want you to
hit daddy's hands.

278
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:33,384
Hit my hands.

279
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,452
- No thanks.

280
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:37,755
- Po.

281
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:42,827
Po.

282
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,066
Po.

283
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:52,870
Po, I'm just trying to help.

284
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:55,006
- Okay, daddy.

285
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:56,741
Quiet time.

286
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:57,975
- All right buddy.

287
00:17:57,977 --> 00:17:58,910
Be careful with
your mom's scarf.

288
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,845
- Okay, bye daddy.

289
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,764
- Ahoy there, landlubber.

290
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:28,699
- Jack?

291
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,803
- The name is
captain long beard.

292
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:36,240
- You mean black beard.

293
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:37,242
- Right.

294
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,177
Well, yes.

295
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:46,083
I was wondering if you
could help me, please.

296
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:48,252
I, uh, well I can't
seem to remember

297
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:50,655
where I buried me treasure.

298
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:52,823
- Don't you have a map?

299
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:55,660
- A map, oh, that's
a great idea!

300
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,530
You're a smart one, Po.

301
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,166
- Po, dinnertime.

302
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:03,734
- I have to go.

303
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:04,902
See ya later.

304
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:11,075
- Bring me back some of them
noodles with the golden sauce.

305
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:12,877
- Po, Po, dinnertime.

306
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,849
- Mac and cheese, please.

307
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:21,118
- Come on.

308
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:27,091
- Ouchie, ouchie,
it hurts daddy.

309
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:30,761
- Come on, Po, come
on, you can do it.

310
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:31,763
Okay, okay.

311
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:36,400
I know, I know, just
try and relax, okay?

312
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:37,535
Breathe.

313
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:39,103
- Okay, ouch.

314
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:40,972
Patrick's a nice name for a boy,

315
00:20:40,974 --> 00:20:42,707
but I think I'll call you Po.

316
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:45,309
- I know it sucks,
buddy, I know it sucks.

317
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:46,611
I know it does.

318
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:47,578
This is why daddy
tries to tell you

319
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,081
to eat your vegetables, honey.

320
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,617
- Where's mommy?

321
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:53,584
- Daddy's here, okay?

322
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,586
I'm here.

323
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,154
- Where's mommy?

324
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,925
And bench stocks took
another beating today.

325
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,193
They just can't seem to get out

326
00:21:02,195 --> 00:21:05,096
of the crosshairs
of the regulators.

327
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:08,966
From the bailouts to the Libor
and the fx scandals to now,

328
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:11,769
cyber security breaches.

329
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,872
The real question out there
is, do we need banks at all?

330
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:16,374
It's truly only a matter of time

331
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:19,910
'til Google or apple
displaces them.

332
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:21,646
That's worth noting.

333
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:25,082
- All right, buddy.

334
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:26,584
Time for bed now.

335
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:30,121
- Amelia Carr is
on the letter m.

336
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:32,356
- Is Amelia a friend
of yours at school?

337
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:34,125
- She has two daddies.

338
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:35,559
- Oh yeah?

339
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:38,262
Well, you only have one daddy,

340
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:39,730
and he has to get back to work,

341
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:40,732
so bed.

342
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:46,003
- Did mommy get this for me?

343
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:50,508
- No, buddy.

344
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,011
Daddy bought this for mommy.

345
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,648
And it is very special.

346
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,351
- Don't be afraid, daddy.

347
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:02,119
- Afraid of what, Po?

348
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,056
- Wrastler.

349
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:08,225
- Goodnight, sweetie.

350
00:22:08,227 --> 00:22:09,860
- Goodnight, daddy.

351
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,765
- Sleep tight, buddy.

352
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,675
More lift.

353
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:28,946
That's all there is to it.

354
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:41,859
- The musk ox, or
Ovibos Moschatus,

355
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:44,862
is quite unusual in that
both male and female members

356
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:47,365
of the species grow horns.

357
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:49,033
How magnificent.

358
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:50,267
- Magnificent.

359
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:54,638
- Turn around.

360
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:05,383
- Welcome to
the aquarium by the sea.

361
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:08,152
- I'm primarily opposed to
the caging of wild animals,

362
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:10,921
but if I was a fish, this
is the place I would pick.

363
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:14,291
We can be carnivores,
that is, eaters of meat,

364
00:23:14,293 --> 00:23:18,062
and still treat animals with
general regard and dignity.

365
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:20,398
Don't you agree, Po?

366
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,999
- Let's put the
dummy in the tank.

367
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:23,001
- Taylor.

368
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:37,815
- I wouldn't call
myself an expert

369
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:40,418
though I am fairly well-read
on the subject of sharks

370
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,753
the Mako shark, to
be more specific.

371
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:45,189
Did you know that the Mako
shark is capable of swimming

372
00:23:45,191 --> 00:23:48,526
at speeds of up to
40 miles per hour?

373
00:23:48,528 --> 00:23:50,428
Most people have
a fear of sharks,

374
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,763
but they are more afraid
of us than we are them,

375
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,298
and for good reason.

376
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:58,235
Over 100 million sharks are
killed every year by humans.

377
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:00,871
- There you are.

378
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:02,773
Please don't wander away from
the rest of the class, okay?

379
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:03,607
- Okay.

380
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,243
- Not today.

381
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:07,845
- This is going to be the first

382
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:10,614
hybrid commercial
aircraft in the world.

383
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:11,982
It is good for the planet.

384
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:13,751
It is great for the airlines

385
00:24:13,753 --> 00:24:15,920
who are going to save
hundreds of millions

386
00:24:15,922 --> 00:24:17,421
in gallons of fuel.

387
00:24:17,423 --> 00:24:19,423
- And how many gallons of
fuel is it going to save us

388
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:21,592
while it's sitting
on the ground?

389
00:24:21,594 --> 00:24:23,294
- Well, technically, if
it's sitting on the ground

390
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,795
you're not using fuel at all.

391
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:25,796
- That's enough, Ben.

392
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,698
- My team and I are very close.

393
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,200
The batteries are efficient,

394
00:24:29,202 --> 00:24:30,835
they're very heavy so we've
had to completely overhaul

395
00:24:30,837 --> 00:24:33,037
traditional wing design
to reach our goals...

396
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,140
- which remains entirely
theoretical at this point.

397
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:39,276
- It's not theoretical,
it's innovative.

398
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:40,878
- I remember you telling me

399
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,449
you wanted this company to
be founded on innovation.

400
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:46,851
That's what I'm doing.

401
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:48,953
I just need more time.

402
00:24:48,955 --> 00:24:52,790
- Two years ago, when we
engaged in this hybrid project,

403
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:55,626
we shared in your
confidence, Mr. Wilson.

404
00:24:55,628 --> 00:24:58,729
But the truth is, at this
point, we are losing money.

405
00:24:58,731 --> 00:24:59,964
The board is not unsympathetic

406
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:01,832
to what you've been
through recently,

407
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,934
however, we have
other considerations.

408
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:06,537
- Thank you, but
this plane will fly.

409
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:08,072
And when it does,

410
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:10,241
this company will be years
ahead of its competition.

411
00:25:10,243 --> 00:25:14,578
- David, would you say
another 30 days would be fair

412
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:18,349
to continue with the project
to achieve our next milestone?

413
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:19,183
- I think...

414
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:20,417
- excuse me.

415
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:22,019
Mr. Wilson, it's a call
from your son's nanny.

416
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,188
Her car broke down and
she can't pick Po up

417
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,024
from sensory
integration therapy.

418
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,426
- Thank you, Peggy.

419
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:30,861
Don't go, I'm sure
he'll be all right

420
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,930
by himself for a while.

421
00:25:32,932 --> 00:25:36,667
- I'm sorry, Randall,
I need to go.

422
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:38,569
We will continue this.

423
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:41,805
My apologies, everyone.

424
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:48,846
- Very good, all
right, now hold on.

425
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:51,649
- Daddy!

426
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:52,783
- Oh.
- Hey.

427
00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:53,617
- Hi.

428
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:55,653
- Daddy, this is Amy.

429
00:25:55,655 --> 00:25:56,487
- Hi.

430
00:25:56,489 --> 00:25:57,321
- She's pretty.

431
00:25:57,323 --> 00:25:59,890
- Oh, okay.

432
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,226
All right, well, we are
moving to the swing now.

433
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:04,662
- Wow, he really
likes this room.

434
00:26:04,664 --> 00:26:06,297
- Is this your first
time at the center?

435
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:10,034
- Yeah, well, I've been
taking him to a lot

436
00:26:10,036 --> 00:26:12,636
of therapy appointments, lately
but it's my first time here.

437
00:26:12,638 --> 00:26:15,673
Not here in this center,
just here in this room.

438
00:26:15,675 --> 00:26:17,041
- Right, got it.

439
00:26:17,043 --> 00:26:18,909
- So, how does
all this help him?

440
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,077
It looks like a
playground in here.

441
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,845
- This is sensory integration.

442
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:25,916
So the human body is designed
to read its environment.

443
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:28,218
Your brain is constantly
receiving signals

444
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,056
from each and every one
of countless receptors

445
00:26:32,058 --> 00:26:34,124
in and on your body.

446
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:37,227
So, imagine if your
clothing, like,

447
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:39,096
constantly felt itchy to you

448
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:42,032
would you be able to then
concentrate on your job?

449
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:46,103
Or, if you weren't
able to tune out sound

450
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:48,472
would you be able to
solve a math problem

451
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:50,808
while hearing your
neighbors arguing?

452
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:54,178
Without the ability to
reflexively manage the system

453
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,715
we would feel totally overwhelmed
and constantly lose focus.

454
00:26:57,717 --> 00:27:00,217
Which is Po's struggle.

455
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:02,987
So here, we are
therapeutically training

456
00:27:02,989 --> 00:27:05,789
his nervous system
to manage itself.

457
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,291
- Wow, thank you.

458
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:08,225
- For what?

459
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:09,360
- I just have been taking him

460
00:27:09,362 --> 00:27:10,861
to all these
therapy appointments

461
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:12,196
and no one really takes
the time to explain to me

462
00:27:12,198 --> 00:27:14,031
exactly how they're helping him.

463
00:27:14,033 --> 00:27:18,268
- Well, honestly, feel free
to ask anything any time.

464
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:21,939
Po, you wanna do music?

465
00:27:21,941 --> 00:27:23,207
- Music time.

466
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:25,175
- Yeah, would you
mind pressing play

467
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:27,044
on that little boom box?

468
00:27:27,046 --> 00:27:28,046
- Oh, sure.

469
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:33,317
Oh, hey, you like
Billy idol, too?

470
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:35,619
- No, not me, that's
Po's favorite.

471
00:27:35,621 --> 00:27:36,687
- Seriously?

472
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:37,955
- Do you wanna actually help?

473
00:27:37,957 --> 00:27:39,189
You can push him on the swing

474
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:40,457
while I see if he can
catch some of these.

475
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:43,027
- Uh, yeah, sure, okay.

476
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:44,795
- Daddy's a wrastler.

477
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:46,463
- What's wrastler?

478
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:48,132
- I wrestled in high school.

479
00:27:48,134 --> 00:27:49,433
His mom showed him
the picture once,

480
00:27:49,435 --> 00:27:50,534
and I think it kinda stuck.

481
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:51,468
- Mm.

482
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,569
- Ready?

483
00:27:52,571 --> 00:27:54,238
- All right, ready Po?

484
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,639
One, two, three.

485
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:00,577
Good job.

486
00:28:02,415 --> 00:28:03,415
- Wow!

487
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:06,483
Fly daddy!

488
00:28:06,485 --> 00:28:08,719
- Pretty cool, isn't it, Po?

489
00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:10,854
- Spin, daddy, spin.

490
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:13,390
- Watch this, he's spinning.

491
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:14,458
- I can fly?

492
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,595
- I don't think so, it's
harder than it looks.

493
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:19,863
Barrel roll.

494
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:21,131
- Careful, daddy.

495
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:24,401
- I can fly.

496
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:25,403
Po can fly.

497
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:29,139
- Okay, okay, okay, now hold on.

498
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:30,641
Now, there we go.

499
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,310
Ready, put your thumbs on there.

500
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:35,779
Nice and easy, nice and easy.

501
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:38,348
- Okay, daddy.

502
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,350
- Good, Po, that's great.

503
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:43,220
All right, now pull
up just a little.

504
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:45,389
No, that's too hard, buddy, Po.

505
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,860
- It's broken.

506
00:28:49,862 --> 00:28:51,095
- Yeah, it is.

507
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,776
Po can fly, huh?

508
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:07,244
- Maybe next time.

509
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:12,015
- Hello.

510
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:15,018
Yeah, no, I know how bad,

511
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,186
yes, Randall.

512
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,457
Yes, you know I would never.

513
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:24,361
Yes, yes, I will,
you know I will.

514
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:26,163
Yes, you know I will.

515
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:31,135
Yes.

516
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,441
Thank you, Randall.

517
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:48,452
Two weeks at,

518
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:49,454
Po, Po!

519
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:51,155
Freeze, freeze!

520
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:56,493
- That was a big ouchie.

521
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:58,629
- You are a very brave boy, Po.

522
00:29:58,631 --> 00:29:59,563
Do you hear me?

523
00:29:59,565 --> 00:30:00,565
Very brave.

524
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:04,268
- Wilson?

525
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,969
- Yeah.

526
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:08,038
- Bill haze, child
social services.

527
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,573
Can I have a word with
you outside, please?

528
00:30:09,575 --> 00:30:11,942
- Uh, what do you
need to talk to me about?

529
00:30:11,944 --> 00:30:15,145
- I think outside
would be better.

530
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:16,647
- Hey, Po, I'll be right back.

531
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:18,048
Stay here, okay?

532
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,449
Stay right here.

533
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:21,518
- Big ouchie.

534
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:25,722
- Okay,

535
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:28,258
let's forgo the bullshit speech

536
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,927
about me not being the enemy.

537
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:32,029
- Listen, I take
good care of my son.

538
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:33,831
- The
bruises, Mr. Wilson.

539
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,465
- What bruises?

540
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:38,168
- The attending physician
noted 17 separate

541
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,237
and aged bruises
on your son's body.

542
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:42,573
- All kids have accidents.

543
00:30:42,575 --> 00:30:43,841
- No, actually that's not true.

544
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:45,542
- Well then, what're
you trying to say?

545
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:48,212
Are you telling me
that I hurt my son?

546
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:50,314
Because Po's not
like other kids, he...

547
00:30:50,316 --> 00:30:51,548
- he has autism.

548
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,751
- Yes, and since his
mother died, especially,

549
00:30:54,753 --> 00:30:56,854
he doesn't pay attention
to his surroundings,

550
00:30:56,856 --> 00:30:58,889
so sometimes he has accidents.

551
00:30:58,891 --> 00:30:59,890
- He gets hurt a lot.

552
00:30:59,892 --> 00:31:02,025
- Sometimes, not because of me.

553
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:04,294
- Yeah, we've already
established that.

554
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:06,697
- Then why do I feel like
you don't believe me?

555
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:08,999
- Okay, we need the speech.

556
00:31:09,001 --> 00:31:11,902
I get called in when
children get hurt.

557
00:31:11,904 --> 00:31:13,704
I try to see those hurts
don't happen again.

558
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:15,239
I take this very seriously

559
00:31:15,241 --> 00:31:16,940
'cause I've seen the
price of failure.

560
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:17,942
- Good.

561
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:22,946
- I'm not your enemy, I'm
your child's advocate.

562
00:31:22,948 --> 00:31:25,649
By the way, that
should make us friends,

563
00:31:25,651 --> 00:31:27,851
but it probably won't.

564
00:31:27,853 --> 00:31:30,153
I don't make decisions
about anything.

565
00:31:30,155 --> 00:31:32,589
I take notes and I
make recommendations.

566
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:34,491
I've studied very
hard to get here.

567
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:36,260
And I've mentored under
some of the best veterans

568
00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:37,494
in my department.

569
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:38,829
And in that time I've
dealt with the cases

570
00:31:38,831 --> 00:31:41,031
of more than 300 children.

571
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:44,368
Now, it's your legal
and god-given right

572
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:47,104
to disagree with me, but please,

573
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:52,075
don't ever tell me I
don't know my business.

574
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,677
- I didn't say you don't
know how to do your job.

575
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,079
I said I didn't hurt my son.

576
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:02,519
- Okay, David, I'll be in touch.

577
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,263
- Great.

578
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,281
- I don't get it.

579
00:33:04,283 --> 00:33:06,049
- It's about loving yourself,

580
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:09,619
being confident, and enjoying
your life to the fullest.

581
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:12,689
- Wow, you got all
that from a song?

582
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:15,225
- Yep.

583
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:20,230
- Look what I invented.

584
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:23,000
Marshmallow,

585
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:27,704
Graham cracker,

586
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:32,242
chocolate.

587
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:35,545
I'm gonna be rich.

588
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:41,284
- Um, it's called
a S'more, Jack.

589
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:45,455
- Oh, that's perfect.

590
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,258
You're a genius, Po.

591
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:52,763
J-e-n-i-o-u-s.

592
00:33:52,765 --> 00:33:57,634
- Jack, genius is
spelled g-e-n-i-u-s.

593
00:33:57,636 --> 00:34:00,971
- Thank you
for that information.

594
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:09,546
- Two weeks left,
how're we doing?

595
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:10,881
- Could not be better.

596
00:34:10,883 --> 00:34:12,482
- You wouldn't lie to
your boss, would you?

597
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:14,384
- Well, if I would,
I would lie to you,

598
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,586
and tell you that I wouldn't.

599
00:34:16,588 --> 00:34:17,588
- Right.

600
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,527
- Two weeks.

601
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:25,495
- Yeah.

602
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:35,472
- Get out of my way, freak.

603
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,741
- Hey, Mr. Wilson.

604
00:35:11,743 --> 00:35:13,043
- Hey, Amy, hi.

605
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:18,148
- Hi, they having a
sale on Mac and cheese?

606
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,483
- Uh, yes, yes.

607
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:22,319
It's for Patrick.

608
00:35:22,321 --> 00:35:23,553
- You might wanna get him

609
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:26,156
to eat some Greens
once in a while.

610
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,558
- There's actually a website

611
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,026
that teaches you how
to get vegetables

612
00:35:30,028 --> 00:35:31,561
inside your kid's Mac and
cheese without them noticing.

613
00:35:31,563 --> 00:35:32,996
It's genius.

614
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:34,831
- Wow, I'm impressed.

615
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:38,034
- That's a lot of water.

616
00:35:38,036 --> 00:35:40,403
- Oh, yeah, it's for
the kids at the center.

617
00:35:40,405 --> 00:35:41,405
- Nice.

618
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:45,709
Do you need some help
getting it to your car?

619
00:35:45,711 --> 00:35:48,678
- Yes, please.

620
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,349
- So, turns out, he'd memorized
the number to yellow cab,

621
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:53,884
he called himself a taxi,

622
00:35:53,886 --> 00:35:56,219
he was halfway to Santa Monica
pier by the time I found him.

623
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:58,155
- Santa Monica pier, why?

624
00:35:58,157 --> 00:35:59,890
- Well, probably
because his mom and I

625
00:35:59,892 --> 00:36:03,393
used to take him
there all the time.

626
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:05,996
I'm sorry, does that
story sound a bit,

627
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:08,064
I mean, I do keep
a close eye on him.

628
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:08,999
I just...

629
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:12,002
- no, no, don't be so sensitive.

630
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:14,070
Po is a total character.

631
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,440
And also, a lot of
kids with autism

632
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:20,010
tend to run off for no reason.

633
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,979
- I just wish that I could
get inside his head sometimes,

634
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:24,848
you know, and see
what he's thinking.

635
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,650
- Yeah, yeah, me too.

636
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:30,153
- Oh, sorry.

637
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:35,125
Okay, I have to
relieve Po's nanny,

638
00:36:35,127 --> 00:36:38,695
so I will see you you
sometime, I suppose.

639
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:40,664
You know, no, of course,

640
00:36:40,666 --> 00:36:43,533
I'll see you at
occupational therapy.

641
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:47,070
- Do you wanna take
down my number?

642
00:36:47,072 --> 00:36:48,438
- Okay.

643
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:51,876
- Here.

644
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,447
That's my cell.

645
00:36:57,449 --> 00:36:59,249
- Smiley face, no one
does that anymore.

646
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:03,420
- I'm old school, so
feel free to call me anytime.

647
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:06,189
Bye, Mr. Wilson.

648
00:37:06,191 --> 00:37:07,691
- David.

649
00:37:07,693 --> 00:37:08,858
- Bye, David.

650
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:30,313
- Oh, it's a rainbow.

651
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,050
- Uh, where's your son's room?

652
00:37:34,052 --> 00:37:35,352
- Uh, this way.

653
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:40,190
He's right in here.

654
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:45,362
- How often does he do that?

655
00:37:45,364 --> 00:37:46,563
- Oh, every once in a while.

656
00:37:46,565 --> 00:37:49,266
You know, it's
comforting to him.

657
00:37:49,268 --> 00:37:50,100
- May I?

658
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:51,668
- Yeah, of course.

659
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:53,603
- Patrick.

660
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:56,306
Patrick.

661
00:37:57,642 --> 00:37:58,642
- Po.

662
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:02,012
- Patrick's a nice
name for a boy,

663
00:38:02,014 --> 00:38:04,981
but I think I'll call you Po.

664
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:06,416
- Well, hey, Po.

665
00:38:06,418 --> 00:38:07,784
My name's bill.

666
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:08,918
- Okay, bill.

667
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:14,824
- So, what'd you eat
that made you so burpy?

668
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:16,059
- Mac and cheese.

669
00:38:16,061 --> 00:38:17,460
- Po, tell him what
you had for lunch.

670
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:18,728
- Mac and cheese, please.

671
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,830
- No, no, buddy, you had
peanut butter and jelly.

672
00:38:20,832 --> 00:38:23,300
- Yuck, no, thank you.

673
00:38:23,302 --> 00:38:25,001
- He's being silly.

674
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:27,404
I mix vegetables into his
Mac and cheese all the time.

675
00:38:27,406 --> 00:38:28,805
He has no idea.

676
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,473
- It's okay.

677
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:31,841
For what it's worth,

678
00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:34,611
your burp smells just
like Mac and cheese.

679
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:40,583
Seven cheese Manicotti, mm-mm.

680
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:42,485
- Okay, bye bye, bill.

681
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:51,294
- This probably wasn't
the best day for us to...

682
00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:52,729
- it never is.

683
00:38:52,731 --> 00:38:54,164
- I just, I just mean the...

684
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:57,200
- listen, I'll be putting
in a recommendation

685
00:38:57,202 --> 00:38:58,968
for dismissal of any
further investigation

686
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,704
into abuse and neglect
in this matter.

687
00:39:00,706 --> 00:39:01,905
- That's great, thank you.

688
00:39:01,907 --> 00:39:03,473
I appreciate that.

689
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,812
- That was the official part.

690
00:39:08,814 --> 00:39:12,048
- Okay, what's,
what's the unofficial?

691
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:16,119
- There's a residential
treatment center in Calabasas,

692
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:18,121
state subsidized,
some federal grants.

693
00:39:18,123 --> 00:39:21,057
I know the director quite well.

694
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:22,692
- I'm sorry, you want
me to put Po in a home?

695
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:23,526
Forget it.

696
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,128
- It's not a home.

697
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,330
It's a facility that
provides schooling

698
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:30,533
and applied behavioral care
for children with autism.

699
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,102
It's a more aggressive
stance, for sure,

700
00:39:32,104 --> 00:39:34,037
but it might just
be what Po needs.

701
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:36,773
- Okay, I can handle
him here, thank you.

702
00:39:36,775 --> 00:39:40,243
- What do intend to do if
your son continues to drift?

703
00:39:40,245 --> 00:39:41,378
- Drift?

704
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,481
- He's moving
somewhere in his mind.

705
00:39:44,483 --> 00:39:47,684
I've seen it before
with other children.

706
00:39:47,686 --> 00:39:50,019
- We all drift in and
out sometimes, don't we?

707
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:51,521
- You and I do, yes,

708
00:39:51,523 --> 00:39:53,923
and then we come back.

709
00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:58,161
Some children, like Po,
drift and don't come back.

710
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:01,197
- I'm with Po every day.

711
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:03,833
I think I know
what's best for him.

712
00:40:03,835 --> 00:40:06,736
- You're in a very unique
position, Mr. Wilson,

713
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:09,038
single dad, special needs son,

714
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,541
it's not very common.

715
00:40:11,543 --> 00:40:13,643
I know we guys like
to convince ourselves

716
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:15,912
that there's glory in
the struggle, but...

717
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,047
- okay, you're right
about one thing.

718
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:19,249
- What's that, David?

719
00:40:19,251 --> 00:40:21,718
- We are not going
to be friends.

720
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,065
- Where is he?

721
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,834
- Ooh, that was a close one.

722
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:46,336
- You're telling me.

723
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:47,670
- Come with me.

724
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:52,041
- Patrick, come out
and play with us.

725
00:41:52,043 --> 00:41:54,377
We're not gonna hurt you.

726
00:41:54,379 --> 00:41:55,379
We promise.

727
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:59,315
Come on, let's look over there.

728
00:41:59,317 --> 00:42:01,084
We're gonna find you.

729
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:10,093
- Don't you just love it here?

730
00:42:10,095 --> 00:42:12,061
- Of course I do.

731
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:15,899
- And if you want to Po,
you can live here forever.

732
00:42:15,901 --> 00:42:17,934
- What do you mean?

733
00:42:17,936 --> 00:42:19,102
- You'll see.

734
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:28,845
- Worldwide sales rose
8.2% in the fourth quarter.

735
00:42:28,847 --> 00:42:31,581
8.2% in the fourth quarter,

736
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:35,718
that's worth noting, 8.2%.

737
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,134
- Hey Po, do you know

738
00:42:51,136 --> 00:42:53,303
if your dad knows how
to use a telephone?

739
00:42:53,305 --> 00:42:55,271
- Daddy's great.

740
00:42:55,273 --> 00:42:56,573
- Oh.

741
00:42:56,575 --> 00:42:57,540
- Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.

742
00:42:57,542 --> 00:43:00,176
- Po, daddy's been very busy.

743
00:43:00,178 --> 00:43:03,046
- Which one should I believe.

744
00:43:03,048 --> 00:43:03,980
- Po.

745
00:43:03,982 --> 00:43:07,550
- Oh, I knew it.

746
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:16,459
- Amelia Carr says that
muskrats are important

747
00:43:16,461 --> 00:43:19,295
to the ecosystem
of north America.

748
00:43:19,297 --> 00:43:21,064
Though minks will eat muskrats,

749
00:43:21,066 --> 00:43:23,099
so be careful, muskrats!

750
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:27,337
- Po, daddy really needs some
quiet time right now, okay?

751
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:37,780
- Amelia Carr has
a beautiful voice.

752
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:44,020
- Po, daddy is very happy that
you have a friend at school.

753
00:43:44,022 --> 00:43:45,688
- She has two daddies.

754
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:48,992
- I know, but, if you're going
to stay in here right now,

755
00:43:48,994 --> 00:43:50,994
I need you to be quiet.

756
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:55,431
- Don't be afraid, daddy.

757
00:43:55,433 --> 00:43:57,500
- Be afraid of what, Po?

758
00:43:58,402 --> 00:43:59,502
- Where's mommy?

759
00:43:59,504 --> 00:44:02,005
- Po, I need quiet, right now.

760
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:03,873
Please.

761
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:06,542
- Oh, okay, daddy.

762
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:17,920
Fax machine, daddy!

763
00:44:17,922 --> 00:44:20,390
- Dammit, Po, shut up!

764
00:44:20,392 --> 00:44:21,891
Shut up!

765
00:44:21,893 --> 00:44:24,994
Why can't you understand the
words coming out of my mouth?

766
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:26,329
Stop talking.

767
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:29,732
I can't think when you
won't stop talking!

768
00:44:32,237 --> 00:44:33,069
Hey, no.

769
00:44:33,071 --> 00:44:34,504
- No, no!

770
00:44:34,506 --> 00:44:36,272
- Okay, I'm sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry, buddy.

771
00:44:36,274 --> 00:44:39,242
Sorry, Po, that
was not your fault.

772
00:44:39,244 --> 00:44:40,910
That was not your fault.

773
00:44:40,912 --> 00:44:42,211
Daddy's an idiot.

774
00:44:42,213 --> 00:44:44,313
Okay, daddy's an idiot.

775
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:59,128
- Amelia Carr can talk
to trees, Amelia Carr.

776
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:05,301
Amelia Carr can talk to trees.

777
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:10,940
- You guys really worked
your asses off on this,

778
00:45:10,942 --> 00:45:12,442
and I appreciate it.

779
00:45:12,444 --> 00:45:13,910
And I talked to Randall,

780
00:45:13,912 --> 00:45:15,845
and while you might be shuffled
around between departments,

781
00:45:15,847 --> 00:45:17,313
you're all keeping your jobs.

782
00:45:17,315 --> 00:45:18,748
- What about you?

783
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:21,050
- Oh, I have the opportunity
to go pursue my dream

784
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,720
of being a medieval blacksmith.

785
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:28,758
- Okay guys, let's give
this guy some room.

786
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:35,431
- Hey, thanks for everything.

787
00:45:35,433 --> 00:45:36,833
- Oh, that's it?

788
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:39,135
You're just going to quit?

789
00:45:39,137 --> 00:45:40,069
- Look, I got fired, man.

790
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:41,571
What do you want me to do?

791
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:45,408
- What I don't want you to do
is to give up on this plane.

792
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:48,878
Come on man, we were this
close, you know that.

793
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,414
- Hey, I'll uh, I'll call you,

794
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:53,416
maybe we can talk about it.

795
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:54,418
- Will you?

796
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:56,986
Please do.

797
00:45:56,988 --> 00:45:57,988
- I will.

798
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:01,057
- Hey, keep your head up.

799
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,633
- Reuters reports
general electric

800
00:46:10,635 --> 00:46:13,436
is down 12 cents
a share profits.

801
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:17,573
12 cents, 12.

802
00:47:25,142 --> 00:47:26,142
- Po, Po!

803
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,746
I need your help.

804
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:39,655
I can't seem to find my horse.

805
00:47:39,657 --> 00:47:42,992
I, uh, I know he's
around here somewhere.

806
00:47:42,994 --> 00:47:47,029
Marshmallow, marshmallow,
where are you?

807
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:48,931
- Marshmallow, really?

808
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,667
- Yes, why?

809
00:47:51,669 --> 00:47:53,603
You don't like it?

810
00:47:53,605 --> 00:47:56,539
- It's kind of a silly
name for a horse, Jack

811
00:47:56,541 --> 00:48:00,276
- oh, well, someone's
in a bad mood.

812
00:48:00,278 --> 00:48:05,047
- I'm just worried about my
dad, he seems sad all the time.

813
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:08,084
- Oh well, parents are weird.

814
00:48:08,086 --> 00:48:09,086
Butterfly!

815
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:15,224
- Okay, good talk.

816
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:22,498
- My boss got a call today

817
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,001
from your healthcare
provider saying that uh,

818
00:48:25,003 --> 00:48:28,771
they were ending their
service contract with Po.

819
00:48:28,773 --> 00:48:30,640
- What, that's gotta
be some kind of glitch.

820
00:48:30,642 --> 00:48:32,308
- I mean, I could
continue working with him

821
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:34,744
if you wanted to pay
out of pocket, but...

822
00:48:34,746 --> 00:48:37,413
- I,.

823
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:39,649
I, I can't, I lost my job.

824
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:41,851
- I'm sorry, I, uh.

825
00:48:41,853 --> 00:48:42,685
- It's okay.

826
00:48:42,687 --> 00:48:44,553
- But the thing is I,

827
00:48:44,555 --> 00:48:46,722
my company won't let me work
with him without a contract

828
00:48:46,724 --> 00:48:48,491
'cause it's like a liability,
and if he were to get...

829
00:48:48,493 --> 00:48:50,793
- yeah, okay, I
totally understand.

830
00:48:50,795 --> 00:48:52,828
I should have continuing
coverage for 12 months,

831
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:54,864
so they shouldn't be
canceling anything.

832
00:48:54,866 --> 00:48:55,798
I'll take care of it.

833
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,366
- Okay.

834
00:48:57,368 --> 00:48:58,200
- Watch out!

835
00:48:58,202 --> 00:48:59,202
- Hey.

836
00:48:59,971 --> 00:49:01,270
- Hey, can I get in?

837
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:03,773
Oh!

838
00:49:03,775 --> 00:49:04,807
- Wrastler.

839
00:49:04,809 --> 00:49:06,309
- Oh!

840
00:49:06,311 --> 00:49:08,711
I'm supposed to have
continuing health coverage

841
00:49:08,713 --> 00:49:11,747
for up to 12 months, or
until I get a new job.

842
00:49:11,749 --> 00:49:13,382
- The coverage
lasts for 12 months,

843
00:49:13,384 --> 00:49:15,451
but that's base services.

844
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:17,820
Nonessential treatment's
cut after 30 days.

845
00:49:17,822 --> 00:49:18,754
- Nonessential?

846
00:49:18,756 --> 00:49:20,990
It's therapy for his condition.

847
00:49:20,992 --> 00:49:22,525
- It's just not
medically defined.

848
00:49:22,527 --> 00:49:24,393
- It is, it's autism.

849
00:49:24,395 --> 00:49:25,928
He has autism.

850
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:28,364
- Which is not a qualifying
medical condition

851
00:49:28,366 --> 00:49:29,832
for base level services.

852
00:49:29,834 --> 00:49:32,535
- This is crazy, this is crazy.

853
00:49:32,537 --> 00:49:34,070
You know this is crazy, right?

854
00:49:34,072 --> 00:49:35,972
About one in 70 kids has autism.

855
00:49:35,974 --> 00:49:37,340
Someone you know has autism.

856
00:49:37,342 --> 00:49:38,908
How can this not be covered?

857
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:42,078
- You can file a formal
complaint, but I must advise you,

858
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,080
the response time is 18 months.

859
00:49:44,082 --> 00:49:48,517
- 18, severance coverage
only lasts 12 months.

860
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:49,986
- Trust me when I tell you,

861
00:49:49,988 --> 00:49:52,521
you're not the first person
to figure that one out.

862
00:49:52,523 --> 00:49:53,789
- Right.

863
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:56,192
- If you wish to keep
nonessential services,

864
00:49:56,194 --> 00:50:00,429
you can move on to a monthly
fee-for-service plan.

865
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:06,302
- Is this a joke?

866
00:50:06,304 --> 00:50:09,038
This is more than out-of-pocket.

867
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,207
Oh, but I'm not the first one

868
00:50:11,209 --> 00:50:13,342
to figure that one
out either, right?

869
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:16,012
- It's the only option we have.

870
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:19,315
- Of course it is.

871
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:45,508
- I wanna play with Amelia Carr.

872
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:47,243
- We're not going to
do that right now, Po.

873
00:50:47,245 --> 00:50:48,677
We're working on shapes.

874
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:49,812
- No, Amelia.

875
00:50:52,249 --> 00:50:53,916
Where's Jack?

876
00:50:53,918 --> 00:50:54,918
- Po.

877
00:50:56,853 --> 00:50:57,686
- Come here.

878
00:50:57,688 --> 00:51:00,322
No, hey, Po, calm down.

879
00:51:00,324 --> 00:51:01,824
Po, stop it.

880
00:51:01,826 --> 00:51:03,292
- Toy store.

881
00:51:03,294 --> 00:51:05,795
- No, the toy store's not there
anymore, Po, you know that.

882
00:51:05,797 --> 00:51:07,129
- Let's go to the toy store.

883
00:51:07,131 --> 00:51:09,698
- No, it's not there anymore.

884
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,900
- Where's mommy?

885
00:51:10,902 --> 00:51:12,835
- Stop it, will
you stop it please?

886
00:51:12,837 --> 00:51:16,338
No, no, hey, you
can't take a shoe.

887
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,474
No, you can't touch that.

888
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:21,243
- Where's mommy?

889
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:22,878
- Po, come here.

890
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,913
Listen to me.

891
00:51:23,915 --> 00:51:25,414
Stop asking me that.

892
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:26,649
Mommy's not here.

893
00:51:26,651 --> 00:51:29,385
And she's not coming back, okay?

894
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:35,958
Po!

895
00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:49,805
Po!

896
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,177
Po, are you?

897
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:00,349
Hey, Po!

898
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:03,152
Po!

899
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:05,821
Po!

900
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:08,824
Hey, can you help
me find my son?

901
00:52:08,826 --> 00:52:10,626
He's 11 years old,
he has brown hair,

902
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:13,329
blue stripped shirt,
and jeans, Po!

903
00:52:13,331 --> 00:52:14,830
You guys see a kid with
a blue stripped shirt?

904
00:52:14,832 --> 00:52:16,132
- We have
a code Adam, young boy.

905
00:52:16,134 --> 00:52:17,500
- Po!

906
00:52:17,502 --> 00:52:18,701
Approximately 10 years old,

907
00:52:18,703 --> 00:52:20,336
blue stripped shirt,
any eyes on him?

908
00:52:20,338 --> 00:52:21,303
- How long ago did you lose him?

909
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:24,173
- I didn't lose him, he ran off,

910
00:52:24,175 --> 00:52:25,608
about 15 minutes.

911
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:26,809
- Has he been here before?

912
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:28,344
Is there a certain store
that he likes a lot?

913
00:52:28,346 --> 00:52:30,212
- He likes the toy store,
but it's not here anymore.

914
00:52:30,214 --> 00:52:31,480
I don't know.

915
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:32,781
- Can you just try and
keep calm, all right?

916
00:52:32,783 --> 00:52:33,883
He's 11, you said?

917
00:52:33,885 --> 00:52:34,817
- Yes.

918
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:35,751
- He should be just fine.

919
00:52:35,753 --> 00:52:36,685
- No, he, you don't understand.

920
00:52:36,687 --> 00:52:38,420
He gets hurt a lot, he's,

921
00:52:38,422 --> 00:52:40,523
hey, are you just gonna
stand there writing?

922
00:52:40,525 --> 00:52:41,357
You know what?

923
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:42,359
Forget it.

924
00:52:43,427 --> 00:52:44,427
Po!

925
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,296
Po, where are you?

926
00:52:47,298 --> 00:52:48,298
Po, Po!

927
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:50,900
- Mr.
Wilson, Mr. Wilson.

928
00:52:50,902 --> 00:52:51,867
- Did you find him?

929
00:52:51,869 --> 00:52:52,701
- Please, just come with me.

930
00:52:52,703 --> 00:52:53,969
- Did you find my son?

931
00:52:53,971 --> 00:52:54,670
- Will you just
come with me, sir?

932
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:55,672
Thank you.

933
00:52:57,374 --> 00:53:00,142
- No, ouchie, ouchie.

934
00:53:00,144 --> 00:53:01,744
It's a rainbow, daddy.

935
00:53:01,746 --> 00:53:03,012
- Are you okay?

936
00:53:03,014 --> 00:53:04,246
Hey, are you okay?

937
00:53:04,248 --> 00:53:05,414
I'm so sorry, buddy.

938
00:53:05,416 --> 00:53:06,949
- Sir, your son
shoplifted these items

939
00:53:06,951 --> 00:53:07,783
from the store over here.

940
00:53:07,785 --> 00:53:09,018
This is pretty serious.

941
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:10,119
- Rainbow, daddy.

942
00:53:10,121 --> 00:53:11,353
- Okay, sweetie.

943
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:14,290
Po, my son, is, he
has some challenges.

944
00:53:14,292 --> 00:53:17,026
He's not a shoplifter,
I swear to you.

945
00:53:17,028 --> 00:53:19,094
He does stuff like this.

946
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:21,530
- Give me a second.

947
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:25,134
- Po, you cannot run
away from me like that.

948
00:53:25,136 --> 00:53:26,936
We've talked about
this so many times.

949
00:53:26,938 --> 00:53:28,671
It makes me very upset.

950
00:53:28,673 --> 00:53:30,239
- Don't be sad, daddy.

951
00:53:30,241 --> 00:53:32,675
- I'm not sad, buddy, I'm just,

952
00:53:32,677 --> 00:53:34,476
I don't know what I am.

953
00:53:34,478 --> 00:53:35,678
- Me too.

954
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,612
All right sir,

955
00:53:36,614 --> 00:53:37,947
we've got something worked out.

956
00:53:37,949 --> 00:53:38,781
- Oh, thank you.

957
00:53:38,783 --> 00:53:40,416
Here, stay right here.

958
00:53:40,418 --> 00:53:41,817
- You'll need to make restitution
for the damaged items,

959
00:53:41,819 --> 00:53:43,686
and it's gonna be few
thousand dollars, sir.

960
00:53:43,688 --> 00:53:44,954
- A few?

961
00:53:44,956 --> 00:53:46,622
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

962
00:53:46,624 --> 00:53:47,590
- We have your name and address,

963
00:53:47,592 --> 00:53:50,025
she'll be sending you the bill.

964
00:53:50,027 --> 00:53:52,561
- Uh, okay, okay, thank you.

965
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:55,197
I'm so sorry about this.

966
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:56,599
I'll take care of all this.

967
00:53:56,601 --> 00:53:57,866
Thank you for your help.

968
00:53:57,868 --> 00:53:59,134
Come on, let's go.

969
00:53:59,136 --> 00:54:01,870
- Sir, few words of
advice, if I may?

970
00:54:02,772 --> 00:54:04,340
- Okay.

971
00:54:04,342 --> 00:54:06,442
- If I was you, I'd keep
my retarded kid on a leash.

972
00:54:06,444 --> 00:54:09,511
That way he won't
get away from you.

973
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:14,216
- Time to go, Po.

974
00:54:17,687 --> 00:54:19,588
- My dad's a wrastler.

975
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:23,859
- You kinda deserved
that, you know.

976
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:45,648
- Hi.

977
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:52,054
I just need you to
tell me it's okay.

978
00:54:56,192 --> 00:54:59,595
I don't know how to
move on without you.

979
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:10,673
- Hey, where you
going off to freak?

980
00:55:10,675 --> 00:55:11,940
I'm talking to you.

981
00:55:11,942 --> 00:55:13,709
- Please, ouchie, ouchie.

982
00:55:13,711 --> 00:55:15,644
- Ouchie, what are you a baby?

983
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:16,845
- Please.

984
00:55:16,847 --> 00:55:18,947
- You don't run away
from me when I call you.

985
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:21,450
You get that through
your little bird brain.

986
00:55:21,452 --> 00:55:23,786
- It's a documented fact
that the inferior members

987
00:55:23,788 --> 00:55:27,156
of the species are prone
to aggressive behavior.

988
00:55:27,158 --> 00:55:27,990
- What a freak.

989
00:55:27,992 --> 00:55:29,558
- I'm not a freak!

990
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,378
- Bye, Patrick, Po.

991
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:28,450
Bye, Po.

992
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:39,661
- Patrick's school teacher,
myself, the therapy instructors,

993
00:56:39,663 --> 00:56:41,130
we've all become quite concerned

994
00:56:41,132 --> 00:56:43,732
about Po's declining situation.

995
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:45,000
I need to inform you

996
00:56:45,002 --> 00:56:46,201
that we're going to
be calling a meeting

997
00:56:46,203 --> 00:56:47,903
to recommend Patrick
be transferred

998
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:49,471
into specialized programming.

999
00:56:49,473 --> 00:56:50,973
- No, you can't do that.

1000
00:56:50,975 --> 00:56:52,841
- We need to, Mr. Wilson.

1001
00:56:52,843 --> 00:56:55,344
We simply can't provide
what he needs here.

1002
00:56:55,346 --> 00:56:58,046
- Right, you mainstream
kids, but the fact is,

1003
00:56:58,048 --> 00:57:00,616
you can't really handle kids
outside of the ordinary.

1004
00:57:00,618 --> 00:57:02,184
They muck up the works.

1005
00:57:02,186 --> 00:57:04,186
They're expensive,
even if they're smart.

1006
00:57:04,188 --> 00:57:06,255
They don't score well on
your standardized tests.

1007
00:57:06,257 --> 00:57:07,289
Isn't that it?

1008
00:57:07,291 --> 00:57:09,124
- Your son is struggling.

1009
00:57:09,126 --> 00:57:11,160
And every single one
of us is sick about it.

1010
00:57:11,162 --> 00:57:13,796
- Come on, this is a
blip, and you know it.

1011
00:57:13,798 --> 00:57:16,298
You know what he's
been going through.

1012
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:17,866
Po is a smart boy.

1013
00:57:17,868 --> 00:57:19,868
He could run circles
around most of these kids.

1014
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:22,604
He just does it in his own way.

1015
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:25,240
He's even starting
to make friends, uh,

1016
00:57:25,242 --> 00:57:27,676
Amelia, Amelia Carr.

1017
00:57:27,678 --> 00:57:30,312
Po has never had a real
friend his own age,

1018
00:57:30,314 --> 00:57:33,615
and he can't stop talking
about this girl here at school.

1019
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:34,850
- Amelia?

1020
00:57:34,852 --> 00:57:37,419
- Amelia Carr, she
has two daddies.

1021
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:44,593
- Mr. Wilson, we do
not have a student

1022
00:57:44,595 --> 00:57:47,429
named Amelia Carr
in this school.

1023
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:51,333
- What are you talking about?

1024
00:57:51,335 --> 00:57:54,102
- I know every student
in this school.

1025
00:57:54,104 --> 00:57:57,873
Not a single Amelia
anything, I assure you.

1026
00:57:57,875 --> 00:57:59,575
- Well that's impossible.

1027
00:57:59,577 --> 00:58:00,609
- Excuse me.

1028
00:58:01,878 --> 00:58:02,945
- Hi, daddy.

1029
00:58:10,387 --> 00:58:11,920
Where's mommy?

1030
00:58:11,922 --> 00:58:13,822
- Stop it, Po.

1031
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:17,392
- Patrick's a
nice name for a boy,

1032
00:58:17,394 --> 00:58:18,694
but I think I'll call you Po.

1033
00:58:18,696 --> 00:58:19,628
- All right, Po.

1034
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:21,530
Hey, Po, calm down, calm down.

1035
00:58:21,532 --> 00:58:23,699
- Where's mommy?

1036
00:58:23,701 --> 00:58:26,001
- Stop it.

1037
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:27,469
No, hey, give me.

1038
00:58:28,705 --> 00:58:30,305
- Where's mommy?

1039
00:58:30,307 --> 00:58:31,707
- Po, stop!

1040
00:58:31,709 --> 00:58:32,741
- Where's mommy?

1041
00:58:33,577 --> 00:58:34,577
- Stop it!

1042
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,212
- Uh oh.

1043
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:40,282
- This is for the expired tags.

1044
00:58:40,284 --> 00:58:42,384
You'll need to get valid
registration within 30 days,

1045
00:58:42,386 --> 00:58:43,852
or the next citation will result

1046
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:46,688
in an impounding
of your vehicle.

1047
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:53,862
What happened to your eye?

1048
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:56,331
- Oh, it was, it was at school.

1049
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:58,600
No, at school,
another kid hit him.

1050
00:58:58,602 --> 00:59:00,335
- Another kid hit him?

1051
00:59:00,337 --> 00:59:01,837
- Yeah, at school.

1052
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:06,542
- Step out of the car, please.

1053
00:59:06,544 --> 00:59:07,709
- Out of the car?

1054
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:08,711
- Yeah.

1055
00:59:10,413 --> 00:59:13,382
- Po, stay here,
everything's fine.

1056
00:59:14,517 --> 00:59:15,851
Okay.
- Come on.

1057
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:21,456
What happened to his eye?

1058
00:59:21,458 --> 00:59:22,958
- Another kid hit him at school.

1059
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,159
I told you.

1060
00:59:24,161 --> 00:59:26,128
- Hey, where are you guys going?

1061
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:28,730
- Po, get back in the
car, everything's fine.

1062
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:29,732
- You okay?

1063
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,234
- It's dinnertime.

1064
00:59:32,236 --> 00:59:35,070
- No, buddy, get
back in the car.

1065
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:40,442
- All right, just
forget about the ticket.

1066
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:43,345
- Okay, we're fine?

1067
00:59:43,347 --> 00:59:44,479
- We're good.

1068
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:46,415
- Come on, honey,
get in the car.

1069
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:47,549
- Drive safe.

1070
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:58,694
- Hi, I'm trying
to reach bill haze.

1071
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:01,730
Yes, I'll hold.

1072
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:12,774
You're gonna love
this place, buddy.

1073
01:00:12,776 --> 01:00:14,276
It's only for a little while,

1074
01:00:14,278 --> 01:00:17,245
and daddy's gonna be there
all the time to see you,

1075
01:00:17,247 --> 01:00:21,249
and they have tons of
fun kids, and guess what?

1076
01:00:21,251 --> 01:00:22,751
They even have
macaroni and cheese.

1077
01:00:22,753 --> 01:00:24,553
Isn't that great, Po?

1078
01:00:33,997 --> 01:00:34,997
Okay, um,

1079
01:00:38,568 --> 01:00:39,568
Po,

1080
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:47,909
the fact is, daddy's been having
a really hard time lately.

1081
01:00:47,911 --> 01:00:49,745
I don't think I'm
doing a very good job

1082
01:00:49,747 --> 01:00:51,647
of taking care of you,

1083
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:55,217
and you deserve the best

1084
01:00:58,688 --> 01:01:01,523
because you're a
very special boy.

1085
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:07,295
Okay, yeah, sorry.

1086
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:09,865
Sorry.

1087
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:32,621
- It's a nice place, safe,

1088
01:01:32,623 --> 01:01:35,090
well-equipped to handle
your son's needs.

1089
01:01:35,092 --> 01:01:36,358
- Patrick will be

1090
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:37,893
well looked after
here, Mr. Wilson,

1091
01:01:37,895 --> 01:01:39,728
we've had a great success rate
with our live-in ABA therapy.

1092
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:41,997
- Uh, I think I should check
on him just one more time.

1093
01:01:41,999 --> 01:01:46,435
- Mr. Wilson. David, you've
already said goodbye.

1094
01:01:46,437 --> 01:01:47,436
You'll just confuse him.

1095
01:01:47,438 --> 01:01:49,071
Give him some time.

1096
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,540
- Yeah.

1097
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:56,078
I'm going to be
here all the time.

1098
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:58,714
- Door's always open.

1099
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:06,488
- Do me a favor, keep
an eye out for Po.

1100
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:08,223
He's pretty special.

1101
01:02:09,425 --> 01:02:10,759
- They all are.

1102
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:11,653
- Uh, wow.

1103
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:15,791
You do realize that
you're way overqualified

1104
01:03:15,793 --> 01:03:17,359
for this position.

1105
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:19,861
- What if I promise to
only work hard enough

1106
01:03:19,863 --> 01:03:23,431
to the point of being
perfectly qualified?

1107
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:26,434
- That's funny, and lazy.

1108
01:03:30,439 --> 01:03:34,709
- Listen, I'm just gonna
be straight with you,

1109
01:03:34,711 --> 01:03:36,378
I have a son with special needs

1110
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:38,213
who's being cared for right now

1111
01:03:38,215 --> 01:03:41,716
by an agency that will certainly

1112
01:03:41,718 --> 01:03:44,953
and probably unexpectedly
cut off funding.

1113
01:03:44,955 --> 01:03:46,688
It's just how these
things always go.

1114
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:47,989
So, I need to get both of us

1115
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:50,258
back onto healthcare
as soon as possible.

1116
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:52,861
So I will do this job,
I will do it well,

1117
01:03:52,863 --> 01:03:54,329
any way you want to.

1118
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:56,565
I will never complain
about it being beneath me

1119
01:03:56,567 --> 01:03:58,166
or about it being boring.

1120
01:03:58,168 --> 01:04:00,202
I will be a model employee.

1121
01:04:00,204 --> 01:04:01,403
And everybody,

1122
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:04,773
everyone will say,

1123
01:04:04,775 --> 01:04:07,909
damn, Randy knows
how to hire people.

1124
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:11,646
Please, I'm begging you.

1125
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:16,484
- There's no need to beg, okay.

1126
01:04:16,486 --> 01:04:19,054
I like you, we'll be in touch.

1127
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:22,557
- Thank you.

1128
01:04:24,994 --> 01:04:26,862
- I'm glad that you called.

1129
01:04:26,864 --> 01:04:30,899
I was um, starting to
wonder about you.

1130
01:04:30,901 --> 01:04:35,637
- I enrolled Po in the
ABA facility in Calabasas.

1131
01:04:35,639 --> 01:04:39,207
- Wow, that must have
been really difficult

1132
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:40,909
- I feel like a horrible father.

1133
01:04:40,911 --> 01:04:43,044
- No, you're not, you're not.

1134
01:04:43,046 --> 01:04:44,913
You're doing everything
that you can.

1135
01:04:44,915 --> 01:04:45,915
- Am I?

1136
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:51,519
- This could turn out to be
a really great thing for him.

1137
01:04:51,521 --> 01:04:55,156
And if it's not, then
you can pull him out.

1138
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:59,594
Oh, here comes one.

1139
01:04:59,596 --> 01:05:01,229
- Look at that, you see
the shape of the wings?

1140
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:03,932
It converts the forward
thrust into lift.

1141
01:05:03,934 --> 01:05:07,202
It takes 75 tons of
metal off the ground.

1142
01:05:07,204 --> 01:05:09,137
It seems to defy all
the laws of physics,

1143
01:05:09,139 --> 01:05:11,239
but the physics are perfect
which is why it works.

1144
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:15,110
And now we've got
composite materials.

1145
01:05:15,112 --> 01:05:16,311
- Yeah.

1146
01:05:16,313 --> 01:05:17,679
- New composite
materials, new designs,

1147
01:05:17,681 --> 01:05:18,847
so we can increase the lift

1148
01:05:18,849 --> 01:05:21,750
and reduce the size and weight.

1149
01:05:21,752 --> 01:05:23,652
- How do you know
all of that stuff?

1150
01:05:23,654 --> 01:05:25,387
- It's what I do,
I'm an engineer.

1151
01:05:25,389 --> 01:05:26,389
- Oh.

1152
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:29,024
- Before I lost my job

1153
01:05:29,026 --> 01:05:31,293
I was working on a
new plane, a hybrid.

1154
01:05:31,295 --> 01:05:32,794
I was designing the airframes,

1155
01:05:32,796 --> 01:05:36,031
the wings and the fuselage,
not the propulsion system.

1156
01:05:36,033 --> 01:05:37,033
Sorry.

1157
01:05:38,201 --> 01:05:40,368
- No, there you go, you
are the first engineer

1158
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:44,606
who's ever explained
his job to me.

1159
01:05:44,608 --> 01:05:45,874
- Unfortunately, I
don't think it's ever

1160
01:05:45,876 --> 01:05:47,876
getting off the ground.

1161
01:05:48,644 --> 01:05:49,911
- Bad physics?

1162
01:05:49,913 --> 01:05:51,446
- Pretty much.

1163
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:53,181
I had it in my head.

1164
01:05:53,183 --> 01:05:56,584
I could see it, and
then it disappeared.

1165
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:01,690
Well, it's just a plane, right?

1166
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:06,895
- I'm sure it was
more than that.

1167
01:06:06,897 --> 01:06:08,263
- Could've been.

1168
01:06:12,169 --> 01:06:15,804
- Well, I believe that
god grants blessings

1169
01:06:17,506 --> 01:06:19,140
in mysterious ways.

1170
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:27,549
- Thanks for coming out
here to talk to me, Amy.

1171
01:06:27,551 --> 01:06:29,551
I really appreciate it.

1172
01:06:29,553 --> 01:06:30,618
- Of course.

1173
01:06:49,238 --> 01:06:52,173
- It's highly repetitive,
and it seems so simplistic,

1174
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:54,809
but we perform these behavioral
routines for several hours

1175
01:06:54,811 --> 01:06:57,979
every day until
they become routine.

1176
01:06:57,981 --> 01:07:00,915
Now the kids are rewarded
for their successes

1177
01:07:00,917 --> 01:07:02,117
mostly in the form of stickers

1178
01:07:02,119 --> 01:07:04,719
that we have here
for goodies and toys.

1179
01:07:04,721 --> 01:07:06,721
And we do this
with social skills,

1180
01:07:06,723 --> 01:07:10,458
academics, self-care and
hygiene, and motor functions.

1181
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:11,292
- What does it really change?

1182
01:07:11,294 --> 01:07:12,494
At the end of the day,

1183
01:07:12,496 --> 01:07:14,929
they're still the
same basic kid, right?

1184
01:07:14,931 --> 01:07:17,832
- Well, here's something
most men understand.

1185
01:07:17,834 --> 01:07:22,737
Now, imagine that you're horrible
at, let's say, basketball,

1186
01:07:22,739 --> 01:07:27,242
just born without the height,
the speed, the coordination.

1187
01:07:27,244 --> 01:07:28,910
But let's say, from
a very early age,

1188
01:07:28,912 --> 01:07:31,579
you're out there with a
coach, every day, for hours

1189
01:07:31,581 --> 01:07:35,016
working on basic
skills, over and over.

1190
01:07:35,018 --> 01:07:38,586
Free throws, set shot,
three-pointer, over and over again,

1191
01:07:38,588 --> 01:07:41,289
training your body
to make these shots.

1192
01:07:41,291 --> 01:07:42,824
Now, through repetition,

1193
01:07:42,826 --> 01:07:44,225
even the most unblessed athlete

1194
01:07:44,227 --> 01:07:47,495
would be reasonably
proficient at these skills.

1195
01:07:47,497 --> 01:07:49,764
And then no, you
don't make the NBA,

1196
01:07:49,766 --> 01:07:53,468
but maybe you make
your high school team,

1197
01:07:53,470 --> 01:07:54,836
and that's not bad.

1198
01:07:54,838 --> 01:07:56,471
- He looks pale to me.

1199
01:07:56,473 --> 01:07:58,073
- Well on that front,
you can rest assured

1200
01:07:58,075 --> 01:08:00,308
that every kid here is getting
three solid meals a day,

1201
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:04,679
plenty of rest, and medical
attention whenever needed.

1202
01:08:04,681 --> 01:08:05,914
- Sounds like,

1203
01:08:07,283 --> 01:08:11,519
I'll be back
on Thursday, thank you.

1204
01:08:13,856 --> 01:08:14,856
Hey, Po.

1205
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:19,494
Uh, I have to go to work.

1206
01:08:19,496 --> 01:08:22,230
But I'll be back on
Thursday, okay buddy?

1207
01:08:22,232 --> 01:08:24,065
- Don't be afraid, daddy.

1208
01:08:29,638 --> 01:08:31,973
- I'll be back on Thursday.

1209
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,754
- Do you think
you're ready to come with me?

1210
01:08:46,756 --> 01:08:48,790
- No, not yet.

1211
01:08:48,792 --> 01:08:51,159
- Okay, you let
me know when you're ready.

1212
01:08:51,161 --> 01:08:52,393
- I will.

1213
01:08:55,164 --> 01:08:56,331
- Oh, it's not broken.

1214
01:08:56,333 --> 01:08:57,899
You just had the blades
on the wrong way.

1215
01:08:57,901 --> 01:09:00,835
These are fixed-pitch propellers,
so two spin clockwise,

1216
01:09:00,837 --> 01:09:02,904
the other two spin
counterclockwise.

1217
01:09:02,906 --> 01:09:04,139
- Cool.

1218
01:09:04,141 --> 01:09:06,574
- Now by precisely and
accurately spinning

1219
01:09:06,576 --> 01:09:08,943
these four propellers
at different speeds,

1220
01:09:08,945 --> 01:09:10,879
all the common
directional movements

1221
01:09:10,881 --> 01:09:14,282
of the standard
helicopter are attained.

1222
01:09:15,918 --> 01:09:16,751
- Wow.

1223
01:09:16,753 --> 01:09:17,585
- There you go.

1224
01:09:17,587 --> 01:09:19,521
- Thank you so, so much.

1225
01:09:19,523 --> 01:09:20,523
- Anytime.

1226
01:09:23,126 --> 01:09:24,692
- Thank you.

1227
01:09:27,796 --> 01:09:28,796
- Now you.

1228
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:32,066
- So this is where
they hide genius.

1229
01:09:32,068 --> 01:09:33,068
- Hey, man.

1230
01:09:34,403 --> 01:09:36,304
- You've been thinking about
our plane, haven't you?

1231
01:09:36,306 --> 01:09:37,605
- I can't stop.

1232
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:39,741
Thank you.

1233
01:09:41,277 --> 01:09:42,877
- Nice digs you got here.

1234
01:09:42,879 --> 01:09:46,181
- Well, they've got
a real health plan.

1235
01:09:47,249 --> 01:09:48,716
Listen, hey, thanks
for the coffee.

1236
01:09:48,718 --> 01:09:49,651
I gotta get back to work.

1237
01:09:49,653 --> 01:09:51,786
- They've got you on boss watch?

1238
01:09:51,788 --> 01:09:54,422
Serious, do they not
understand who you are?

1239
01:09:54,424 --> 01:09:55,256
Should I tell them?

1240
01:09:55,258 --> 01:09:56,724
- Please don't.

1241
01:09:56,726 --> 01:09:58,426
- All right, well listen,
I've been doing some thinking,

1242
01:09:58,428 --> 01:10:01,329
and I think that what
you need is a woman.

1243
01:10:01,331 --> 01:10:02,564
Wait, hear me out.

1244
01:10:02,566 --> 01:10:04,532
What we're gonna do
is we're gonna go out,

1245
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:05,700
we're gonna get some drinks,

1246
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:06,868
we're gonna meet
some nice girls.

1247
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:08,803
We drive to Vegas.

1248
01:10:08,805 --> 01:10:10,872
- I can't, I can't.

1249
01:10:10,874 --> 01:10:14,609
I, uh, I've kind of
started seeing somebody.

1250
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:18,846
- Wow, I'm happy for you, man.

1251
01:10:23,485 --> 01:10:25,720
I'm, all right, all right.

1252
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:31,659
My boy David is
getting some, people!

1253
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:34,329
- Really?

1254
01:10:35,764 --> 01:10:37,632
- You are a good
man, David Wilson.

1255
01:10:37,634 --> 01:10:39,667
- Have a nice day,
total stranger.

1256
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:44,706
- Woo!

1257
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:18,740
- That's amazing.

1258
01:11:18,742 --> 01:11:21,009
- And if you board
this ship, Po,

1259
01:11:21,011 --> 01:11:23,778
you can live here forever.

1260
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:26,180
- Are they lost children too?

1261
01:11:26,182 --> 01:11:28,816
- Oh no, not lost, in movement.

1262
01:11:30,586 --> 01:11:33,921
You see all beings exist
on multiple planes.

1263
01:11:33,923 --> 01:11:36,824
But most can only perceive
the one that they're on.

1264
01:11:36,826 --> 01:11:40,361
They're unable, or
unwilling to see the others.

1265
01:11:40,363 --> 01:11:42,864
But some children,
have the ability

1266
01:11:42,866 --> 01:11:45,533
to tune into other frequencies.

1267
01:11:46,769 --> 01:11:49,370
That's why you appear
tuned out in their world

1268
01:11:49,372 --> 01:11:52,573
because you're moving
between places, Po.

1269
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:54,842
Well, they don't understand it,

1270
01:11:54,844 --> 01:11:56,778
so they give it simple names,

1271
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:59,681
refer to it as a
medical condition.

1272
01:11:59,683 --> 01:12:03,518
But the children here
are from the world over.

1273
01:12:06,755 --> 01:12:09,157
- This is all so incredible.

1274
01:12:09,159 --> 01:12:12,160
- Oh, Po, this is
just one channel.

1275
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:15,930
The places your
mind will take you,

1276
01:12:15,932 --> 01:12:20,168
I can't even begin to imagine.

1277
01:13:04,313 --> 01:13:05,747
- Has he been eating?

1278
01:13:05,749 --> 01:13:07,749
- It's been a struggle.

1279
01:13:14,690 --> 01:13:15,690
- Po.

1280
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:18,226
Po.

1281
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:21,429
- Patrick's a nice
name for a boy.

1282
01:13:21,431 --> 01:13:23,564
- Do you remember me, Po?

1283
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:26,834
- Amelia Carr can talk to trees.

1284
01:13:26,836 --> 01:13:28,169
- It's Amy, Po.

1285
01:13:29,571 --> 01:13:31,205
- Jack's my friend.

1286
01:13:40,349 --> 01:13:43,184
- I'd really like to be put
in the loop on his report.

1287
01:13:43,186 --> 01:13:44,585
- I do appreciate your concern,

1288
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:45,853
but that's really
just limited to...

1289
01:13:45,855 --> 01:13:46,855
- please.

1290
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:50,958
- I'll list you as family.

1291
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,026
- Thank you.

1292
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:09,343
Mm, you're right, this
is a great Pb and j.

1293
01:14:09,345 --> 01:14:10,345
- I told you.

1294
01:14:13,715 --> 01:14:15,850
- Um, I saw Po yesterday.

1295
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:20,188
- At shoreline, why?

1296
01:14:20,190 --> 01:14:21,489
- I missed him.

1297
01:14:23,392 --> 01:14:26,561
- I wish you would've
asked me first.

1298
01:14:27,663 --> 01:14:31,833
- I'm sorry, I was just,
um, worried about him.

1299
01:14:31,835 --> 01:14:35,203
- Yeah, I'm worried
about him too,

1300
01:14:35,205 --> 01:14:36,571
but I didn't have a choice

1301
01:14:36,573 --> 01:14:39,307
'cause his school's
pushing him out,

1302
01:14:39,309 --> 01:14:42,743
and the whole insurance
screw up, and my job,

1303
01:14:42,745 --> 01:14:45,046
and I don't have any money,

1304
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:48,282
so I can't take care of him.

1305
01:14:48,284 --> 01:14:51,452
Bill was right, I let
my ego get in the way.

1306
01:14:51,454 --> 01:14:52,286
I did it with my job.

1307
01:14:52,288 --> 01:14:53,621
I did it with Po.

1308
01:14:53,623 --> 01:14:56,591
- Do you ever wonder
why Po drifts?

1309
01:14:57,659 --> 01:14:59,827
- Do I wonder why he drifts?

1310
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:01,229
Yeah, yeah, I do.

1311
01:15:02,297 --> 01:15:03,231
I wonder why he drifts.

1312
01:15:03,233 --> 01:15:05,099
I wonder why he flaps his arms.

1313
01:15:05,101 --> 01:15:06,567
I wonder why he won't eat.

1314
01:15:06,569 --> 01:15:09,704
I wonder if he'll ever
learn how to tie his shoes,

1315
01:15:09,706 --> 01:15:12,573
or get a girlfriend,
or get married, yeah.

1316
01:15:12,575 --> 01:15:14,275
I wonder a lot.

1317
01:15:14,277 --> 01:15:15,776
- Well, when I was there,

1318
01:15:15,778 --> 01:15:19,080
they told me that you hadn't
seen I'm in a couple of days.

1319
01:15:19,082 --> 01:15:20,882
- They told you that?

1320
01:15:22,251 --> 01:15:24,785
I've been working double
shifts at a hobby shop,

1321
01:15:24,787 --> 01:15:26,020
so we don't lose our house.

1322
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:27,255
Did they tell you that?

1323
01:15:27,257 --> 01:15:30,625
- I just think that
when you get the time,

1324
01:15:30,627 --> 01:15:32,393
you should probably go see him.

1325
01:15:32,395 --> 01:15:33,427
- Where's this coming from?

1326
01:15:33,429 --> 01:15:34,595
Why are you on my case?

1327
01:15:34,597 --> 01:15:35,730
You're not his mom.

1328
01:15:35,732 --> 01:15:38,499
- You're right, I'm not his mom.

1329
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:43,037
But you're his dad.

1330
01:15:44,439 --> 01:15:48,209
Do not let him drift away
'til there's nothing left.

1331
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:50,177
I'm only trying to help.

1332
01:15:50,179 --> 01:15:53,648
- Well, I didn't
ask for your help.

1333
01:15:53,650 --> 01:15:54,982
- You're right.

1334
01:16:57,646 --> 01:16:59,080
- David.

1335
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:01,950
- Beth.

1336
01:17:05,654 --> 01:17:08,889
- I thought I'd sleep
in here tonight.

1337
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:12,460
- I miss you so much.

1338
01:17:14,363 --> 01:17:16,163
- Is Po okay?

1339
01:17:16,165 --> 01:17:17,565
- Po?

1340
01:17:17,567 --> 01:17:19,367
- Didn't you just
go check on him?

1341
01:17:19,369 --> 01:17:21,602
I thought I heard him cry.

1342
01:17:21,604 --> 01:17:23,404
- Yeah, yeah, I just,

1343
01:17:27,809 --> 01:17:29,043
I can't do this alone.

1344
01:17:29,045 --> 01:17:30,978
I need you here.

1345
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:32,647
- You've done real well.

1346
01:17:32,649 --> 01:17:34,382
You'll do just fine.

1347
01:17:35,717 --> 01:17:37,685
Don't be afraid, David.

1348
01:18:02,544 --> 01:18:03,711
- Hello.

1349
01:18:03,713 --> 01:18:04,979
- Mr.
Wilson, you're son Po

1350
01:18:04,981 --> 01:18:06,981
has gone missing from shoreline.

1351
01:18:06,983 --> 01:18:09,350
Please come to the facility
as soon as you can.

1352
01:18:13,489 --> 01:18:14,755
- Bill, where is he?

1353
01:18:14,757 --> 01:18:15,990
- David, I'm really sorry,

1354
01:18:15,992 --> 01:18:17,224
but we have no idea where...

1355
01:18:17,226 --> 01:18:18,492
- we searched the
entire facility.

1356
01:18:18,494 --> 01:18:20,261
He's definitely not
inside the building.

1357
01:18:20,263 --> 01:18:22,329
- I assure you, this has
never happened before.

1358
01:18:22,331 --> 01:18:24,031
- You have surveillance
cameras on the property?

1359
01:18:24,033 --> 01:18:25,232
- Yeah, we do.

1360
01:18:25,234 --> 01:18:26,801
It's DVR inside the
administration's office.

1361
01:18:26,803 --> 01:18:28,903
- Great, now you wanna
tell me how you lose a kid?

1362
01:18:28,905 --> 01:18:30,137
- We will find
him, I promise you.

1363
01:18:30,139 --> 01:18:31,405
- -Yeah, bill this is
your responsibility!

1364
01:18:31,407 --> 01:18:32,239
- David, calm down.

1365
01:18:32,241 --> 01:18:33,407
- Don't you tell me...

1366
01:18:33,409 --> 01:18:35,109
- sir, we have a
witness who saw a boy

1367
01:18:35,111 --> 01:18:36,610
that matches the description,

1368
01:18:36,612 --> 01:18:39,613
who got into a cab here on
this street about an hour ago.

1369
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:41,115
What we don't have

1370
01:18:41,117 --> 01:18:42,616
is the name of the taxi
company or license plate.

1371
01:18:42,618 --> 01:18:44,118
- Oh, god.

1372
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:48,522
- Do you have any idea where
your son might take a cab?

1373
01:18:48,524 --> 01:18:49,724
- Yes.

1374
01:19:38,173 --> 01:19:39,173
Po!

1375
01:19:40,342 --> 01:19:41,342
Po.

1376
01:19:42,744 --> 01:19:43,744
Po.

1377
01:19:49,084 --> 01:19:50,818
Po, can you hear me?

1378
01:19:54,823 --> 01:19:57,424
- Come on, are you ready?

1379
01:19:57,426 --> 01:19:59,226
- Once I get on the rocket ship,

1380
01:19:59,228 --> 01:20:01,762
there's no coming back, right?

1381
01:20:01,764 --> 01:20:06,767
- We exist on many planes,
but we can only live on one.

1382
01:20:06,769 --> 01:20:08,702
I know you'll make
the right choice, Po.

1383
01:20:08,704 --> 01:20:11,839
- Don't you leave
me, you understand?

1384
01:20:13,909 --> 01:20:16,410
I am not going to let you go.

1385
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:19,380
- I'm ready.

1386
01:20:19,382 --> 01:20:20,714
- I'm glad, Po.

1387
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:23,617
- Po, please.

1388
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:25,986
Po.

1389
01:20:27,455 --> 01:20:29,190
Po, can you hear me?

1390
01:20:30,859 --> 01:20:32,193
Come on, buddy.

1391
01:20:34,062 --> 01:20:37,331
Po, Po, please come
back to me, buddy.

1392
01:20:49,311 --> 01:20:50,311
Hey, Po.

1393
01:20:54,482 --> 01:20:55,482
Po.

1394
01:20:58,486 --> 01:21:00,955
- Don't be afraid daddy.

1395
01:21:00,957 --> 01:21:05,159
- Don't be afraid of what, pal?

1396
01:21:05,161 --> 01:21:07,228
- Don't be afraid of me.

1397
01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:11,365
I don't want people
to be afraid of me.

1398
01:21:12,634 --> 01:21:15,736
Don't be afraid of me, daddy.

1399
01:21:15,738 --> 01:21:18,205
- I'm not afraid of you.

1400
01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:20,941
Daddy's not afraid, not anymore.

1401
01:21:23,311 --> 01:21:24,712
- Where's mommy?

1402
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:34,855
- Po, mommy died,

1403
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:46,500
and I didn't take you
to the funeral because,

1404
01:21:46,502 --> 01:21:48,636
I was wrong, I was wrong.

1405
01:21:50,305 --> 01:21:52,239
And you didn't get a
chance to say goodbye,

1406
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:53,807
and I am so sorry.

1407
01:21:55,944 --> 01:22:00,414
You listen to me, Po,
your mommy is in heaven,

1408
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:02,650
and she is dancing with angels.

1409
01:22:02,652 --> 01:22:03,751
She's fine.

1410
01:22:03,753 --> 01:22:04,585
You hear me?

1411
01:22:04,587 --> 01:22:06,887
Your mommy's fine.

1412
01:22:06,889 --> 01:22:07,889
- I know.

1413
01:22:10,191 --> 01:22:11,759
I miss her, daddy.

1414
01:22:16,731 --> 01:22:19,400
- I miss her too, buddy.

1415
01:22:19,402 --> 01:22:20,834
I miss her too.

1416
01:22:33,348 --> 01:22:34,748
Let's go, buddy.

1417
01:22:55,036 --> 01:22:56,704
- In light of all
of our meetings

1418
01:22:56,706 --> 01:22:58,605
with Po over the past few days,

1419
01:22:58,607 --> 01:23:00,307
and with a new, rather detailed

1420
01:23:00,309 --> 01:23:02,276
plan of attack from Po's father,

1421
01:23:02,278 --> 01:23:06,513
we've decided to have Po back
at Parker elementary school.

1422
01:23:06,515 --> 01:23:09,750
And thanks to Jack
and his watchful eyes,

1423
01:23:09,752 --> 01:23:13,153
Taylor march has been
expelled for bullying.

1424
01:23:13,155 --> 01:23:17,391
I'm so sorry we didn't catch
this sooner, Mr. Wilson.

1425
01:23:17,393 --> 01:23:18,959
- Thank you, Jack.

1426
01:23:23,398 --> 01:23:24,865
- Natural selection
is the theory

1427
01:23:24,867 --> 01:23:27,968
of plant and animal
adaptation first introduced

1428
01:23:27,970 --> 01:23:30,204
by Charles Darwin in 1859.

1429
01:23:32,207 --> 01:23:33,440
Not that you would notice,

1430
01:23:33,442 --> 01:23:35,242
but I've moved on
to the letter n.

1431
01:23:35,244 --> 01:23:36,744
- Natural selection
is the theory

1432
01:23:36,746 --> 01:23:39,246
by which organisms with
more favorable traits

1433
01:23:39,248 --> 01:23:41,515
are more likely to survive.

1434
01:23:41,517 --> 01:23:44,752
- Po Wilson, you've
been borrowing my book

1435
01:23:44,754 --> 01:23:46,687
without my permission.

1436
01:23:46,689 --> 01:23:47,689
- Yeah.

1437
01:23:54,096 --> 01:23:56,497
- I'm afraid it's that time.

1438
01:24:12,747 --> 01:24:16,717
Over time you'll forget
about me more and more.

1439
01:24:20,655 --> 01:24:22,723
We'll still be with you,

1440
01:24:25,427 --> 01:24:28,929
as will your mother,
and all of the others

1441
01:24:28,931 --> 01:24:30,664
looking out for you.

1442
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:40,574
Always and forever.

1443
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:13,006
- All right.

1444
01:25:23,051 --> 01:25:24,518
What do ya think?

1445
01:25:27,889 --> 01:25:29,690
- It's a rainbow, daddy!

1446
01:25:29,692 --> 01:25:31,625
- Yeah, is there a rainbow?

1447
01:25:31,627 --> 01:25:32,627
- Rainbow!

1448
01:25:40,335 --> 01:25:41,335
- Rainbow.

1449
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:45,139
- Rainbow.

1450
01:25:51,579 --> 01:25:55,816
- It's the rainbow!

1451
01:25:55,818 --> 01:25:58,519
Of course, it's a rainbow!

1452
01:25:58,521 --> 01:25:59,920
You're a genius!

1453
01:26:02,357 --> 01:26:03,557
- I told you.

1454
01:26:03,559 --> 01:26:04,391
- You told me.

1455
01:26:04,393 --> 01:26:05,425
- A rainbow.

1456
01:26:05,427 --> 01:26:07,127
- Yes, you did.

1457
01:26:07,129 --> 01:26:08,428
- Rainbow.
- High five.

1458
01:26:13,401 --> 01:26:14,401
It flies.

1459
01:26:15,403 --> 01:26:18,205
My son calls it
the rainbow wing.

1460
01:26:18,207 --> 01:26:20,674
It increases lift by 80%.

1461
01:26:20,676 --> 01:26:23,443
This design will change
the way you and I fly

1462
01:26:23,445 --> 01:26:25,946
for the rest of our lives.

1463
01:26:25,948 --> 01:26:26,948
- My god!

1464
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:29,716
- And you're sure it flies?

1465
01:26:29,718 --> 01:26:32,719
- Oh, yeah, it
flies, we tested it.

1466
01:26:32,721 --> 01:26:35,989
You can do a full-scale
test as early as next month.

1467
01:26:35,991 --> 01:26:38,926
- That is the plan
I promised you.

1468
01:26:38,928 --> 01:26:40,827
- Good job, David.

1469
01:26:40,829 --> 01:26:43,297
- Thanks, oh, one more thing,

1470
01:26:44,599 --> 01:26:45,999
I quit.

1471
01:26:46,001 --> 01:26:47,234
- Excuse me?

1472
01:26:47,236 --> 01:26:49,536
- Uh, he just gets excited.

1473
01:26:50,405 --> 01:26:52,306
- Thank you, Peggy.

1474
01:26:52,308 --> 01:26:53,273
- Wait, wait.

1475
01:26:53,275 --> 01:26:56,176
Are, are you seriously quitting?

1476
01:26:56,178 --> 01:26:59,413
- David, at least you gotta
come back and work here.

1477
01:26:59,415 --> 01:27:01,181
- No, I'm handing the
project over to Ben.

1478
01:27:01,183 --> 01:27:03,984
He is the second
smartest guy you've got.

1479
01:27:03,986 --> 01:27:05,118
- That's funny.

1480
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:06,954
- What are you gonna do?

1481
01:27:06,956 --> 01:27:09,022
- Well, I might come if you
get your healthcare sorted out,

1482
01:27:09,024 --> 01:27:10,958
but until then, I'm gonna
take a little break,

1483
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:13,694
and spend some time with my son.

1484
01:27:20,301 --> 01:27:21,802
- It's unusual for
someone your age

1485
01:27:21,804 --> 01:27:24,871
to clear out their 401.

1486
01:27:24,873 --> 01:27:28,108
- Well, I'm unusual,
and so is my son.

1487
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:30,043
And I wanna take a
couple of months off

1488
01:27:30,045 --> 01:27:32,045
without losing my house.

1489
01:27:32,047 --> 01:27:33,280
- Are you sure you
don't wanna keep

1490
01:27:33,282 --> 01:27:35,315
a couple long-term positions?

1491
01:27:35,317 --> 01:27:39,253
This is rather a large
amount to take in cash.

1492
01:27:39,255 --> 01:27:40,654
- I don't know if
I'd call it large,

1493
01:27:40,656 --> 01:27:42,956
but if my paycheck
contributions haven't added up

1494
01:27:42,958 --> 01:27:46,326
to at least 20k, I'm
calling the cops.

1495
01:27:46,328 --> 01:27:50,731
- Mr. Wilson, you have over
$400,000 in your account.

1496
01:27:50,733 --> 01:27:51,965
- What?

1497
01:27:51,967 --> 01:27:53,433
- I admit, some
of the stock picks

1498
01:27:53,435 --> 01:27:56,870
were rather risky, but they
did pay off quite well.

1499
01:27:56,872 --> 01:27:59,539
- Uh, I haven't made
any stock picks.

1500
01:27:59,541 --> 01:28:02,242
- Well, I assume that these
are your order sheets.

1501
01:28:02,244 --> 01:28:04,011
We've been receiving the faxes.

1502
01:28:04,013 --> 01:28:07,414
This is your verified
signature on them.

1503
01:28:10,151 --> 01:28:12,286
- Autograph, please.

1504
01:28:14,989 --> 01:28:16,156
- Of course, if you'd like

1505
01:28:16,158 --> 01:28:17,591
to question the funds
in your account.

1506
01:28:17,593 --> 01:28:19,393
- Check, please.

1507
01:28:19,395 --> 01:28:20,395
- Yes, sir.

1508
01:28:21,863 --> 01:28:24,431
- Mac and cheese!

1509
01:28:27,635 --> 01:28:29,036
- Mm, it's good.

1510
01:28:30,538 --> 01:28:32,639
- She's pretty, daddy.

1511
01:28:32,641 --> 01:28:34,708
- She's very pretty, Po.

1512
01:28:36,277 --> 01:28:38,545
- You boys are too sweet.

1513
01:28:38,547 --> 01:28:39,780
Oh, I was going to
give you something.

1514
01:28:39,782 --> 01:28:41,515
I know that it's not
your birthday yet,

1515
01:28:41,517 --> 01:28:44,451
but I want you to open it.

1516
01:28:44,453 --> 01:28:45,552
- What did you do?

1517
01:28:45,554 --> 01:28:46,720
- You'll see.

1518
01:28:48,923 --> 01:28:50,090
- Wow, wow, wow!

1519
01:28:50,092 --> 01:28:51,092
What is it?

1520
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,427
- Billy idol tickets?

1521
01:28:53,429 --> 01:28:55,862
- Billy idol, Billy
idol, Billy idol,

1522
01:28:55,864 --> 01:28:57,831
Billy idol, Billy idol!

1523
01:29:20,855 --> 01:29:21,855
Hi, mom.

1524
01:29:28,663 --> 01:29:30,797
I have something for you.
