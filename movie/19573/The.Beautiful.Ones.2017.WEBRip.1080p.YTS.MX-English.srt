1
00:00:57,904 --> 00:01:00,490
<i>I spent my life traveling
in one direction.</i>

2
00:01:00,866 --> 00:01:03,618
<i>Driven by greed, narcissism, arrogance.</i>

3
00:01:04,077 --> 00:01:06,329
<i>And a slight obsession
with Steve McQueen.</i>

4
00:01:07,414 --> 00:01:09,749
<i>You see I'm what I call
a professional criminal.</i>

5
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:12,043
<i>But back in the day
you'd have called me a gangster.</i>

6
00:01:13,295 --> 00:01:14,713
<i>I was blood-tied to the second most...</i>

7
00:01:14,754 --> 00:01:17,007
<i>...powerful crime family in Los Angeles.</i>

8
00:01:17,507 --> 00:01:21,595
<i>Then, well, one decision changed it all.</i>

9
00:01:22,762 --> 00:01:23,972
<i>See that girl?</i>

10
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,517
<i>That girl happens to be
the daughter of the boss...</i>

11
00:01:27,559 --> 00:01:29,436
<i>...of our bitter enemy, The Romanos.</i>

12
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,023
<i>But first, the most powerful
crime family in California.</i>

13
00:01:34,274 --> 00:01:36,318
<i>Talk about star-crossed lovers.</i>

14
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,737
<i>But right now, here...</i>

15
00:01:39,279 --> 00:01:41,907
<i>We're about to cross
that wonderful line in the sand.</i>

16
00:01:41,948 --> 00:01:44,034
<i>That glorious mark of no return.</i>

17
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,995
<i>As Steve McQueen said...</i>

18
00:01:47,287 --> 00:01:48,622
<i>I live for myself...</i>

19
00:01:49,247 --> 00:01:50,957
<i>...and I answer to nobody.</i>

20
00:01:53,126 --> 00:01:57,088
In 1972 McQueen fell in love
with his co-star in <i>The Getaway.</i>

21
00:01:57,464 --> 00:02:00,258
And at that point she was married
to studio chief Robert Evans.

22
00:02:00,926 --> 00:02:02,511
When a divorce was mentioned,

23
00:02:02,552 --> 00:02:04,805
Evans found incriminating
information on McQueen...

24
00:02:04,846 --> 00:02:06,389
...and the divorce was settled quickly.

25
00:02:08,183 --> 00:02:10,685
To this day, the nature
of that evidence is unknown.

26
00:02:11,228 --> 00:02:12,978
I mean, what did those
private investigators dig up...

27
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:15,065
...on McQueen that was so volatile?

28
00:02:16,483 --> 00:02:17,984
I want you to think about that.

29
00:02:19,152 --> 00:02:20,904
Because what's
happening in here is private.

30
00:02:20,946 --> 00:02:22,154
And I don't want you imagining...

31
00:02:22,155 --> 00:02:23,365
...anything that's going on.

32
00:02:26,118 --> 00:02:28,245
<i>There's moments of calm
that you remember.</i>

33
00:02:28,578 --> 00:02:30,413
<i>Not the actual storm itself.</i>

34
00:02:30,914 --> 00:02:33,125
<i>How quiet. How soulful.</i>

35
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:35,877
How without pretense she is.

36
00:02:36,962 --> 00:02:39,131
You think of all the magical
things you want to say to her...

37
00:02:39,172 --> 00:02:40,924
...and you go to speak
and nothing comes out.

38
00:02:41,716 --> 00:02:42,968
So you just smile.

39
00:02:44,427 --> 00:02:46,346
She smiles back and it's all fine.

40
00:04:09,346 --> 00:04:11,264
The girl's in the truck. Let's go.

41
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,377
I've known you since...
For how long now?

42
00:04:40,418 --> 00:04:42,212
Since before you were
in the army, right?

43
00:04:42,254 --> 00:04:43,630
Since you were a kid.

44
00:04:43,672 --> 00:04:45,590
I'm your friend Carl.

45
00:04:46,007 --> 00:04:47,509
I'm your <i>people,</i> Gabe.

46
00:04:49,469 --> 00:04:50,971
Gabe, buddy.

47
00:04:52,305 --> 00:04:54,516
It shouldn't be like this, man.
It's undignified.

48
00:04:55,142 --> 00:04:56,351
Man, I know what you're capable of.

49
00:04:56,393 --> 00:04:57,936
No need to labor the point.

50
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,940
I heard about Sebastian.

51
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,775
You're famous, man.

52
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:06,403
Yeah. Big man on campus, huh, Gabe?

53
00:05:06,778 --> 00:05:08,822
Just tell him what you heard, Carl.

54
00:05:09,448 --> 00:05:10,574
What I heard...

55
00:05:10,824 --> 00:05:11,908
Oh, well...

56
00:05:13,034 --> 00:05:16,496
I heard that Sebastian was into
Caterina for, like, ten large.

57
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:19,249
What you did to that poor man...

58
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,584
And how you left him.

59
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,620
It's the stuff of legend, Gabriel.

60
00:05:22,627 --> 00:05:23,795
It really is.

61
00:05:24,463 --> 00:05:26,006
But if you've got a heart...

62
00:05:26,131 --> 00:05:28,425
I was hoping I could reach you
with my observation.

63
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:32,387
And I now fully appreciate
my position here, so...

64
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:35,807
I am happy to pay, Gabe.

65
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:38,059
But I need it to be known...

66
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,812
That it wasn't without resistance.

67
00:05:41,354 --> 00:05:43,023
That you broke me, okay?

68
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:46,193
It's all here. Every bit of it.

69
00:05:48,987 --> 00:05:50,030
He's good.

70
00:05:51,406 --> 00:05:52,449
I'm good.

71
00:05:54,493 --> 00:05:57,579
I don't think you're as bad
as your reputation, Gabe!

72
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,210
But I'm happy to let that be.

73
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,095
Glasses like this were made
to hide some awful pain.

74
00:06:14,971 --> 00:06:18,433
They were designed to disguise
some deep psychological trauma.

75
00:06:20,102 --> 00:06:22,604
I feel like Peggy Cummings in <i>Gun Crazy.</i>

76
00:06:22,938 --> 00:06:25,732
About to embark
on an interstate robbery spree.

77
00:06:25,774 --> 00:06:27,359
You want some of me, Copper?

78
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,194
You'll never take me alive.

79
00:06:34,908 --> 00:06:36,284
That's fifteen for the wing tips...

80
00:06:36,326 --> 00:06:38,453
...and six hundred
and fifty for the Presols.

81
00:06:38,495 --> 00:06:41,581
Six hundred and fifty for a pair
of second hand shades, Gabe?

82
00:06:42,082 --> 00:06:43,625
Six fifty and tax.

83
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:46,294
They're worth every penny.

84
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:50,090
714 Persol, folding sunglasses.

85
00:06:50,924 --> 00:06:53,009
Blue glass anti-glare lens.

86
00:06:53,051 --> 00:06:55,220
And the handmade Italian leather case.

87
00:06:57,139 --> 00:06:58,890
Steve McQueen owned a pair.

88
00:07:00,058 --> 00:07:01,184
Yes, he did.

89
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,603
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.

90
00:07:03,645 --> 00:07:06,648
He also wore M43 rough outs in
the <i>Great Escape.</i>

91
00:07:07,023 --> 00:07:08,900
Fashionably tapered white chinos.

92
00:07:08,942 --> 00:07:11,528
A button up woolen cardigan
over a sport shirt.

93
00:07:11,903 --> 00:07:14,364
It's not that I don't have
my own sense of style.

94
00:07:14,656 --> 00:07:16,031
It just seems that my life
is that much easier...

95
00:07:16,032 --> 00:07:17,284
...dressed like the man.

96
00:07:17,993 --> 00:07:19,244
You ready, blondie?

97
00:07:23,915 --> 00:07:25,876
Now remember, you can't smile
wearing these glasses.

98
00:07:25,917 --> 00:07:27,169
No. Of course not.

99
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,461
And it's absolutely essential that...

100
00:07:28,462 --> 00:07:30,464
...we wear them inside
in the darkened hallways...

101
00:07:30,505 --> 00:07:32,716
...of a shady apartment
building somewhere.

102
00:07:33,049 --> 00:07:34,801
But that will all change
when we get the package.

103
00:07:34,843 --> 00:07:36,261
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

104
00:07:36,303 --> 00:07:38,388
From who? The big fat scary man?

105
00:07:40,182 --> 00:07:41,391
You bought those shades because...

106
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:44,019
...Steve McQueen wore
the same make, didn't you?

107
00:07:45,145 --> 00:07:47,439
Why does it always have to be
Steve McQueen?

108
00:07:48,064 --> 00:07:49,733
Don't you think it's a little...

109
00:07:50,025 --> 00:07:52,194
- A little weird?
- What is?

110
00:07:52,235 --> 00:07:54,446
How obsessed you are over some actor.

111
00:07:54,821 --> 00:07:57,282
I mean I can only name
maybe one of his movies.

112
00:07:57,324 --> 00:07:58,700
Have you seen <i>Papillon?</i>

113
00:07:58,742 --> 00:07:59,910
Sounds riveting.

114
00:08:00,285 --> 00:08:01,806
See, that comment
right there just killed...

115
00:08:01,828 --> 00:08:04,247
...any chance of
a long-term commitment from me.

116
00:08:08,126 --> 00:08:10,712
So when I take her home and
I tell her I'm going to call her,

117
00:08:10,754 --> 00:08:11,797
I won't.

118
00:08:11,838 --> 00:08:13,298
And that will be the end of that.

119
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,382
You ready?

120
00:08:30,482 --> 00:08:31,525
Thank you.

121
00:08:31,942 --> 00:08:33,151
For the drive...

122
00:08:33,652 --> 00:08:34,736
The glasses.

123
00:08:38,865 --> 00:08:40,534
Gabriel, I'll call you.

124
00:08:55,507 --> 00:08:57,050
She used to walk around my apartment...

125
00:08:57,092 --> 00:08:58,718
...in these black stockings.

126
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,095
Just those and a T-shirt.

127
00:09:00,303 --> 00:09:02,556
Oh my God, those legs.

128
00:09:03,557 --> 00:09:06,351
<i>I'd watch her make coffee
just pretending to be asleep.</i>

129
00:09:06,935 --> 00:09:08,270
<i>Just watch her march,</i>

130
00:09:08,311 --> 00:09:10,939
<i>doing that tip toe walk
that girls do in their socks.</i>

131
00:09:28,832 --> 00:09:30,709
You see how white her skin is?

132
00:09:32,836 --> 00:09:36,381
That juxtaposition of white
against black on her thigh.

133
00:09:38,675 --> 00:09:40,427
You want to put your mouth there.

134
00:09:41,303 --> 00:09:43,096
Like a baby on a milk bottle.

135
00:10:46,618 --> 00:10:47,869
<i>Do I respect her?</i>

136
00:10:48,286 --> 00:10:49,287
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

137
00:10:49,913 --> 00:10:52,124
But if it came down to keeping
or discarding her...

138
00:10:52,165 --> 00:10:54,334
That wonderful thigh swinging bounce...

139
00:10:57,379 --> 00:10:58,839
Farewell, my love.

140
00:11:00,298 --> 00:11:01,508
Farewell.

141
00:11:15,021 --> 00:11:16,064
There she is.

142
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,151
When McQueen met McGraw
in <i>The Getaway...</i>

143
00:11:19,192 --> 00:11:20,901
...he said she was the kind
of woman you would cheat...

144
00:11:20,902 --> 00:11:21,987
...and then kill for.

145
00:11:24,156 --> 00:11:26,783
I ask myself that question
every time I see a woman I like.

146
00:11:27,451 --> 00:11:29,661
It just kills me.
I should stay but...

147
00:11:30,287 --> 00:11:32,289
My family... You don't want to be early.

148
00:11:32,622 --> 00:11:34,374
And I sure as hell
don't want to be late.

149
00:11:40,255 --> 00:11:42,591
See, my family,
they're dangerous people.

150
00:11:44,676 --> 00:11:47,137
And they expect punctuality
from their employees.

151
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:50,140
And as such they demand that
the family set a rigid example.

152
00:11:53,059 --> 00:11:54,811
<i>So I work for my aunt Caterina.</i>

153
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,316
And presently that means
that I run with the enforcers.

154
00:12:00,484 --> 00:12:02,204
See she put me on this detail
because she figured...

155
00:12:02,235 --> 00:12:04,362
...it was a good way
to get me back into the game.

156
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,282
Knock away any aspirations
I may have picked up...

157
00:12:07,324 --> 00:12:08,700
...while in the Middle East.

158
00:12:11,745 --> 00:12:13,955
My delightful companions for
the afternoon.

159
00:12:15,332 --> 00:12:16,708
<i>Listen, if you're looking to correct...</i>

160
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,460
<i>...the imbalance of justice in
the world...</i>

161
00:12:18,502 --> 00:12:20,170
<i>...then this is not your line of work.</i>

162
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,005
<i>Because like the man said...</i>

163
00:12:22,088 --> 00:12:24,674
Justice is for one and all...

164
00:12:25,342 --> 00:12:27,093
The same way the Ritz Hotel is.

165
00:13:10,512 --> 00:13:12,848
We don't want to be here just as
much as you don't want us here.

166
00:13:12,931 --> 00:13:15,434
All right? But Caterina has got
a reputation to uphold.

167
00:13:15,475 --> 00:13:16,935
And if you fail to acknowledge that...

168
00:13:16,977 --> 00:13:19,062
...then where does that leave us, huh?

169
00:13:19,438 --> 00:13:20,814
So, listen to me, brother.

170
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:23,525
Before this goes any further, tell me...

171
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,320
Are you going to pay or not...

172
00:13:26,361 --> 00:13:28,029
...because I've got
some decisions to make.

173
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,323
- Yeah.
- You sure?

174
00:13:30,574 --> 00:13:31,867
It's in the dresser.

175
00:13:32,951 --> 00:13:35,370
Top drawer. Grocery bag.

176
00:13:40,292 --> 00:13:41,376
You all right?

177
00:13:42,127 --> 00:13:43,170
You all right?

178
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,102
That wasn't so hard now, was it?

179
00:14:07,152 --> 00:14:09,196
Looking a little pale there, Gabriel.

180
00:14:13,867 --> 00:14:15,368
It's been awhile, Casper.

181
00:14:16,787 --> 00:14:18,789
I heard you were playing
castrati in a quartet...

182
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:21,374
...for the Aryan Brotherhood.
How's your singing voice, champ?

183
00:14:24,002 --> 00:14:25,378
That's very funny.

184
00:14:27,214 --> 00:14:29,925
Now don't trip over yourself when
you see what I've got for you.

185
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:33,094
A little present from up north.

186
00:14:34,054 --> 00:14:35,806
Like them apples, twinkle toes?

187
00:14:36,848 --> 00:14:38,850
Real elephant ivory grips.

188
00:14:39,684 --> 00:14:41,812
I had them fashion me a type and match.

189
00:14:43,063 --> 00:14:44,523
You're pretty tough with the steel...

190
00:14:44,564 --> 00:14:46,108
...for a mealy-mouthed faggot.

191
00:14:46,691 --> 00:14:48,443
You want to see what you are
without it, huh?

192
00:14:49,027 --> 00:14:51,613
Big man, thinks his war record
is something special,

193
00:14:51,655 --> 00:14:52,906
but what does it mean?

194
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:55,450
I'll tell you what...

195
00:14:56,201 --> 00:14:59,246
Some phony medals
and a hillbilly heroin habit.

196
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:05,710
I know you better than you think.
Don't forget that.

197
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:12,509
Now while you were away...

198
00:15:13,135 --> 00:15:15,220
Learning to polish your boots...

199
00:15:15,762 --> 00:15:17,347
I was learning the ropes.

200
00:15:18,348 --> 00:15:20,225
Tony's been grooming me.

201
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:23,562
Which means, one day you and I
will go head to head.

202
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,105
Or...

203
00:15:27,315 --> 00:15:28,483
Or what?

204
00:15:29,901 --> 00:15:32,571
Are you willing to play nice
and share your toys?

205
00:15:34,197 --> 00:15:35,824
You can come over, man.
Be like old times.

206
00:15:35,866 --> 00:15:37,325
You've just got to say it.

207
00:15:40,162 --> 00:15:42,038
Just say I'm sorry.

208
00:15:46,918 --> 00:15:48,170
You know what the problem is?

209
00:15:51,006 --> 00:15:53,717
You let your ambition outweigh
your ability, Casper.

210
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,304
You'll only ever be the odd man out.

211
00:15:58,513 --> 00:16:01,016
You won't mean shit as a chief.

212
00:16:02,768 --> 00:16:05,812
You may wish you'd have taken
my advice there, sunshine!

213
00:16:13,361 --> 00:16:16,072
<i>My aunt Caterina runs a club downtown.</i>

214
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,033
<i>It's an ugly little place.</i>

215
00:16:18,909 --> 00:16:22,788
From there she manages at least a
dozen more questionable v
