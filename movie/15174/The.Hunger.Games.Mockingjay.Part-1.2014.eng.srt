2
00:00:12,752 --> 00:00:14,306
I never wanted any of this.

3
00:00:15,387 --> 00:00:17,016
I never wanted to be in the games.

4
00:00:17,621 --> 00:00:19,268
I just wanted to save my sister,

5
00:00:19,823 --> 00:00:22,063
- and keep Peeta alive.
- Miss Everdeen,

6
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,649
it's the things we love most

7
00:00:27,251 --> 00:00:28,527
that destroy us.

8
00:00:48,743 --> 00:00:50,216
I want everyone who's watching

9
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,929
- to lay down their weapons now.
- You're alive!

10
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,992
Peeta is the Capitol's weapon.

11
00:00:58,241 --> 00:01:00,041
The same way you are ours.

12
00:01:01,006 --> 00:01:03,355
You will rescue Peeta
at the earliest opportunity

13
00:01:03,604 --> 00:01:05,941
or you will find
another Mocking Jay.
