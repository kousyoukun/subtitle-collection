1
00:00:34,003 --> 00:00:37,453
Start simple Start with what you know is true.

2
00:00:38,374 --> 00:00:42,447
My name is Katniss Everdeen My home is District 12.

3
00:00:42,548 --> 00:00:45,984
I was in the Hunger Games. I escaped.

4
00:00:46,084 --> 00:00:49,752
Peeta... Peeta was left behind.

5
00:00:53,723 --> 00:00:55,457
Miss Everdeen?

6
00:00:56,057 --> 00:00:58,141
You can't be in here.

7
00:00:59,296 --> 00:01:02,067
I had a nightmare.
Just five more minutes.

8
00:01:02,468 --> 00:01:06,768
You need to sleep.
We can help you sleep.

9
00:01:07,837 --> 00:01:10,016
Just five more minutes.

10
00:01:10,116 --> 00:01:11,519
No.

11
00:01:14,511 --> 00:01:16,247
No, please, don't.It's just five more...

12
00:01:16,347 --> 00:01:20,649
Don't touch me! Don't! No! No! Get off of me!

13
00:02:17,774 --> 00:02:19,141
Finnick.

14
00:02:23,547 --> 00:02:26,981
I wanted to go back
for Peeta and Johanna,

15
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,487
but I...

16
00:02:29,587 --> 00:02:31,753
I couldn't move.

17
00:02:36,026 --> 00:02:39,295
They have Annie, too. They took her.

18
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:44,517
She's...

19
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,902
She's in the Capitol.

20
00:02:51,107 --> 00:02:53,075
I wish she was dead.

21
00:02:55,111 --> 00:02:58,413
I wish they were all dead
and we were, too.

22
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,447
Miss Everdeen.

23
00:03:29,647 --> 00:03:32,950
Colonel Boggs,District 13's head of security.

24
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:36,821
I know you've been discharged, but President
Coin's requested to meet with you first.

25
00:03:37,021 --> 00:03:38,989
Is there any news?

26
00:03:39,089 --> 00:03:41,332
I'm just here to escort you.

27
00:04:13,056 --> 00:04:16,127
We were always told there was nothing left of 13.

28
00:04:16,227 --> 00:04:18,863
Capitol bombed the surface to rubble.

29
00:04:19,931 --> 00:04:23,198
But we're military, so we learned to survive down here.

30
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,006
Preparing, training.

31
00:04:26,836 --> 00:04:28,496
The war never stopped for us.

32
00:05:00,503 --> 00:05:04,342
There she is. Our Girl on Fire.

33
00:05:04,442 --> 00:05:08,212
Madam President, may I present you with The Mockingjay.

34
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:11,182
What an honor it is to meet you.

35
00:05:11,282 --> 00:05:15,820
You're a courageous young woman. I know how disorienting this must be.

36
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,423
And I can't imagine what it's like to live
through the atrocities of those Games.

37
00:05:19,524 --> 00:05:23,161
Katniss, President Alma Coin.

38
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:26,630
Please know how welcome you are.

39
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:31,642
I hope you'll find some comfort with us.
We've known loss in 13, too.

40
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:36,607
This is history. Right here at this table.

41
00:05:36,707 --> 00:05:39,881
I apologize. I wish you had more time to recover, but unfortunately,

42
00:05:39,981 --> 00:05:43,044
we don't have that luxury. Please, have a seat.

43
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,007
Are you aware of what's happened?

44
00:05:48,618 --> 00:05:52,020
When you fired your arrow at the force field

45
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:54,625
you electrified the nation.

46
00:05:54,725 --> 00:05:59,756
There have been riots and uprisings and strikes in seven districts.

47
00:05:59,864 --> 00:06:02,233
We believe that if we keep this energy going

48
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:05,136
we can unify the districts against the Capitol.

49
00:06:05,236 --> 00:06:08,072
But if we don't, if we let it dissipate,

50
00:06:08,172 --> 00:06:11,175
we could be waiting another 75 years for this opportunity.

51
00:06:11,275 --> 00:06:15,146
- Everyone in 13 is ready for this.
- What about Peeta? Is he alive?

52
00:06:15,246 --> 00:06:18,883
I don't know. And I wish that I did.

53
00:06:18,983 --> 00:06:22,119
But there's no way for me to contact
my operatives inside the Capitol.

54
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,990
The Capitol has always suppressed
communication between the districts.

55
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:29,527
But I know their system very well.

56
00:06:29,627 --> 00:06:33,464
I managed to break through.
All we need now is the perfect message.

57
00:06:33,564 --> 00:06:35,766
Katniss, here's what we need to do.

58
00:06:35,867 --> 00:06:38,436
We need to show them that The Mockingjay's alive and well

59
00:06:38,536 --> 00:06:41,439
and willing to stand up and join this fight.

60
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:46,544
'Cause we need every district to stand up to this Capitol. 

61
00:06:46,644 --> 00:06:48,542
The way you did.

62
00:06:49,078 --> 00:06:54,051
So we're gonna shoot a series of propaganda clips,

63
00:06:54,151 --> 00:06:57,355
propos, I like to call them, on The Mockingjay.

64
00:06:57,455 --> 00:06:59,357
Spreads the word

65
00:06:59,457 --> 00:07:02,126
that we're gonna stoke the fire of this rebellion.

66
00:07:02,226 --> 00:07:04,929
The fire that The Mockingjay started.

67
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:07,465
You left him there.

68
00:07:07,565 --> 00:07:11,402
- You left Peeta in that arena to die.
- Katniss, there are so many...

69
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:13,303
Peeta was the one who was supposed to live.

70
00:07:13,403 --> 00:07:15,057
Miss Everdeen.

71
00:07:16,573 --> 00:07:19,177
This revolution is about everyone.

72
00:07:19,277 --> 00:07:23,078
It's about all of us. And we need a voice.

73
00:07:24,247 --> 00:07:26,781
Then you should've saved Peeta.

74
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,026
Maybe you should have rescued the boy instead.

75
00:07:37,527 --> 00:07:39,053
Oh, no.

76
00:07:40,397 --> 00:07:44,569
No, listen to me. No one else can do this but her.

77
00:07:44,668 --> 00:07:46,833
This is not the girl you described.

78
00:07:48,271 --> 00:07:52,543
Obviously, we need to make it personal.
Remind her who the real enemy is.

79
00:07:52,643 --> 00:07:54,345
She knows who the enemy is. That's not the issue.

80
00:07:54,445 --> 00:07:56,444
Unless she's forgotten.

81
00:07:57,447 --> 00:07:59,914
There's explaining and there's showing.

82
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:03,553
Let her see what the Capitol did to 12.

83
00:08:03,753 --> 00:08:07,723
She can't handle it. The Games destroyed her.

84
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,626
This is the only choice you have.

85
00:08:11,928 --> 00:08:15,165
People don't always show up the way
you want them to, Madam President.

86
00:08:15,265 --> 00:08:18,977
But that anger, that anger-driven defiance,
that's what we want.

87
00:08:19,077 --> 00:08:22,340
And we can redirect it. We need to unite these people out there

88
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,943
that have been doing nothing but killing
each other in an arena for years.

89
00:08:26,043 --> 00:08:28,912
We have to have a lightning rod.

90
00:08:29,412 --> 00:08:32,783
They'll follow her. She's the face of the revolution.

91
00:08:32,884 --> 00:08:34,750
Let her see it. Let her go home.

92
00:08:37,621 --> 00:08:39,287
Send her.

93
00:09:05,814 --> 00:09:07,749
I can't believe you're going through with this.

94
00:09:09,185 --> 00:09:10,588
You can say "no."

95
00:09:10,888 --> 00:09:12,989
I need to see it for myself.

96
00:09:14,157 --> 00:09:15,690
This way.

97
00:10:12,448 --> 00:10:16,284
13 swept everything, top to bottom so you'd be safe.

98
00:10:18,154 --> 00:10:20,624
You sure you don't want me to go with you?

99
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:23,458
Yeah. I'm sure.

100
00:10:26,796 --> 00:10:29,097
We'll have our eyes on you from above.

101
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,629
Figures.

102
00:14:04,313 --> 00:14:06,016
Hey!

103
00:14:06,316 --> 00:14:07,949
Come on.

104
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:11,252
Don't you wanna see Prim?

105
00:14:12,923 --> 00:14:15,756
There you go. You're breakin' my heart.

106
00:15:25,262 --> 00:15:26,995
Egeria!

107
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:32,333
We need to fix these lines.

108
00:15:33,569 --> 00:15:35,839
I won't say "rebels."

109
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:39,266
These are senseless acts of defiance.

110
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,142
And I won't legitimize them.

111
00:15:42,611 --> 00:15:45,446
We'll call them "criminals."

112
00:15:48,552 --> 00:15:50,053
"Radicals."

113
00:15:52,456 --> 00:15:56,324
Otherwise we're breaking my oldest rule.

114
00:15:57,294 --> 00:16:00,261
Never let them see you bleed.

115
00:16:02,798 --> 00:16:04,777
Citizens,

116
00:16:05,401 --> 00:16:10,637
tonight I address all of Panem as one.

117
00:16:11,575 --> 00:16:13,811
Since the Dark Days,

118
00:16:13,911 --> 00:16:18,015
Panem has had an unprecedented era of peace.

119
00:16:18,115 --> 00:16:21,518
It is a peace built upon cooperation.

120
00:16:21,618 --> 00:16:24,580
And a respect for law and order.

121
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:28,358
In the past weeks, you have heard of sporadic violence

122
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:33,563
following the actions of a few radicals in the Quarter Quell.

123
00:16:34,163 --> 00:16:37,502
Those who choose this destructive path,

124
00:16:37,602 --> 00:16:40,003
your actions are based on a misunderstanding

125
00:16:40,103 --> 00:16:44,242
of how we have survived. Together.

126
00:16:44,341 --> 00:16:46,442
It is a contract.

127
00:16:47,044 --> 00:16:52,616
Each district supplies the Capitol. Like blood to a heart.

128
00:16:52,715 --> 00:16:58,088
In return, the Capitol provides order and security.

129
00:16:58,388 --> 00:17:00,924
To refuse work

130
00:17:01,124 --> 00:17:04,956
is to put the entire system in danger.

131
00:17:05,061 --> 00:17:08,665
The Capitol is the beating heart of Panem.

132
00:17:08,765 --> 00:17:11,436
Nothing can survive without a heart.

133
00:17:12,935 --> 00:17:15,569
The criminals that kneel before you

134
00:17:16,204 --> 00:17:19,576
use symbols for the purpose of sedition.

135
00:17:19,676 --> 00:17:23,113
Which is why all images of The Mockingjay

136
00:17:23,213 --> 00:17:24,545
are now forbidden.

137
00:17:26,082 --> 00:17:29,052
Possessing them will be considered treason.

138
00:17:29,152 --> 00:17:31,218
Punishable by death.

139
00:17:32,454 --> 00:17:35,023
Justice shall be served swiftly.

140
00:17:35,624 --> 00:17:38,496
Order shall be restored.

141
00:17:39,096 --> 00:17:42,543
To those who ignore the warnings of history,

142
00:17:48,737 --> 00:17:52,709
prepare to pay the ultimate price.

143
00:18:37,686 --> 00:18:39,389
It's okay.

144
00:18:39,689 --> 00:18:40,991
We're okay.

145
00:18:41,491 --> 00:18:43,359
We're all here now.

146
00:18:43,459 --> 00:18:44,958
Buttercup!

147
00:18:46,595 --> 00:18:48,444
I smuggled him in.

148
00:18:52,134 --> 00:18:54,068
I got Dad.

149
00:18:57,139 --> 00:18:59,741
And I got some of your herbs
from the kitchen.

150
00:19:01,377 --> 00:19:03,713
They have strict rules.

151
00:19:03,813 --> 00:19:06,203
I don't know what they'll do
if they find him here.

152
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,369
You should try to eat something.

153
00:19:36,612 --> 00:19:38,681
Hello. Good evening.

154
00:19:38,781 --> 00:19:41,985
And a big welcome to all in Panem.

155
00:19:42,085 --> 00:19:46,224
I'm Caesar Flickerman. And whoever
you are, whatever it is you're doing,

156
00:19:46,323 --> 00:19:49,960
if you're working, put down your work.
If you're having dinner, stop having dinner.

157
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:54,264
Because you are going to want to witness this tonight.

158
00:19:54,564 --> 00:19:59,837
There has been rampant speculation about
what really happened in the Quarter Quell.

159
00:20:00,037 --> 00:20:04,641
And here to shed a little light on the
subject for us is a very special guest.

160
00:20:04,741 --> 00:20:08,909
Please welcome Mr. Peeta Mellark.

161
00:20:09,411 --> 00:20:11,414
Peeta, a lot of people

162
00:20:11,514 --> 00:20:14,684
feel as though they are in the dark.

163
00:20:14,784 --> 00:20:17,320
Yeah, I know how they feel.

164
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,189
Now, so set the stage for us.

165
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:22,292
Talk us through what really happened

166
00:20:22,392 --> 00:20:24,961
on that final and controversial night.

167
00:20:25,061 --> 00:20:30,268
Well, first off, you have to understand that when you're in the Games

168
00:20:30,367 --> 00:20:34,271
- you only get one wish. It's very costly.
- You're alive.

169
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:36,673
- It costs your life.
- I think it costs more than your life.

170
00:20:36,773 --> 00:20:38,208
How do you mean? What's more than your life?

171
00:20:38,308 --> 00:20:42,646
I mean to murder innocent people, that costs everything that you are.

172
00:20:42,745 --> 00:20:43,980
Yes.

173
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,584
So you hold on to that one wish.

174
00:20:47,984 --> 00:20:50,453
And that night my wish was to save Katniss.

175
00:20:50,554 --> 00:20:51,922
Yes.

176
00:20:52,021 --> 00:20:54,858
I should've just run off with her earlier in the day like she'd wanted.

177
00:20:54,958 --> 00:21:00,196
But you didn't. Why?  Were you caught up in Beetee's plan?

178
00:21:00,297 --> 00:21:03,363
No, I was caught up trying to play allies.

179
00:21:03,899 --> 00:21:06,209
And then they separated us and...

180
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,136
that's when I lost her.

181
00:21:11,006 --> 00:21:13,042
And then the lightning hit...

182
00:21:13,142 --> 00:21:16,913
and the whole force field around the arena just blew out.

183
00:21:17,013 --> 00:21:22,106
Yes, but, Peeta, Katniss is the one who blew it out.

184
00:21:22,206 --> 00:21:23,553
- No.
- You saw the footage.

185
00:21:23,653 --> 00:21:26,223
No, she didn't know what she was doing.

186
00:21:26,323 --> 00:21:29,859
Neither of us knew there was a bigger plan going on. We had no idea.

187
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,123
- You had no idea?
- No.

188
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:36,066
All right. Well, Peeta, there are many who find this suspicious to say the least.

189
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:40,437
It seems as though she was part of a rebel plan.

190
00:21:40,537 --> 00:21:44,242
Do you think it was part of her plan to be almost killed by Johanna?

191
00:21:44,341 --> 00:21:47,010
Or part of the plan to be paralyzed by lightning?

192
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:51,249
No, we were not part of any rebel plan. We had no idea what was going on.

193
00:21:51,648 --> 00:21:55,418
All right. I believe you, Peeta Mellark. Thank you.

194
00:21:55,518 --> 00:21:56,344
Yeah.

195
00:21:56,444 --> 00:21:58,755
And I was going to ask you to speak about the unrest

196
00:21:58,855 --> 00:22:02,759
- but I think you might be too upset.
- No, I can.

197
00:22:02,859 --> 00:22:04,461
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, absolutely.

198
00:22:04,561 --> 00:22:06,323
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

199
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:14,104
I want everyone who's watching to stop

200
00:22:14,204 --> 00:22:17,507
and to think about what a civil war could mean.

201
00:22:17,607 --> 00:22:22,302
We almost went extinct once before. And now our numbers are even fewer.

202
00:22:22,402 --> 00:22:24,047
- He's one of them.
- Is this really what we wanna do?

203
00:22:24,147 --> 00:22:26,849
- He's a traitor.
- Kill ourselves off?

204
00:22:26,949 --> 00:22:30,555
- Killing is not the answer.
- I can't believe he's doing this.

205
00:22:30,654 --> 00:22:32,956
Everyone needs to lay down their weapons immediately.

206
00:22:33,056 --> 00:22:35,926
- Traitor!
- He's not one of us!

207
00:22:36,025 --> 00:22:37,694
This is treason!

208
00:22:38,194 --> 00:22:40,961
Are you calling for a ceasefire?

209
00:22:41,328 --> 00:22:43,132
Yeah. I am.

210
00:22:43,232 --> 00:22:45,168
- You're a puppet!
- Hang him!

211
00:22:45,668 --> 00:22:49,072
I want everyone to stop the senseless violence.

212
00:22:49,172 --> 00:22:52,342
- This is not the path to change.
- Traitor!

213
00:22:52,442 --> 00:22:55,251
It's not the path to justice.

214
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,634
There can't be a ceasefire.

215
00:23:22,204 --> 00:23:24,339
Not after everything Snow's done.

216
00:23:25,774 --> 00:23:27,776
He could have done
a lot of damage tonight.

217
00:23:28,076 --> 00:23:31,615
Most districts, people are still too afraid
to join. They need the courage.

218
00:23:31,714 --> 00:23:33,201
Why do you think he said that?

219
00:23:35,619 --> 00:23:37,683
I don't know. Maybe he was forced.

220
00:23:42,691 --> 00:23:44,758
He didn't look that bad.

221
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:49,495
Maybe he made some kind
of deal to protect you.

222
00:23:52,534 --> 00:23:54,716
He's still playing the game.

223
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:05,645
No! No! No!

224
00:24:11,153 --> 00:24:14,291
I'm sorry. It's just a nightmare.

225
00:24:14,391 --> 00:24:16,557
That's okay. I get 'em, too.

226
00:24:20,762 --> 00:24:21,862
Peeta,

227
00:24:23,899 --> 00:24:25,550
will you stay with me?

228
00:24:26,268 --> 00:24:27,734
Yeah.

229
00:24:39,815 --> 00:24:40,733
Always.

230
00:24:48,356 --> 00:24:49,823
Hey.

231
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:52,758
Can't sleep?

232
00:25:11,313 --> 00:25:13,312
Tell me what's happening.

233
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,313
I'm good at keeping secrets.

234
00:25:16,986 --> 00:25:18,127
Even from Mom.

235
00:25:24,092 --> 00:25:26,860
No one hates the Capitol more than me.

236
00:25:28,764 --> 00:25:32,531
And I wanna help.
But I just keep thinking,

237
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:37,031
even if we win this war,
what happens to Peeta?

238
00:25:38,106 --> 00:25:41,711
I know he's not safe there,
but he's definitely not safe here.

239
00:25:41,912 --> 00:25:45,848
I don't think you know
how important you are to them.

240
00:25:45,948 --> 00:25:49,583
If you want something,
you just have to ask.

241
00:25:50,752 --> 00:25:53,455
You could demand almost anything.

242
00:25:53,555 --> 00:25:56,326
They'd have to agree to it.

243
00:25:56,426 --> 00:25:59,093
I should wake you up
more often, Little Duck.

244
00:26:01,329 --> 00:26:03,130
Get some sleep now.

245
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:06,035
You, too.

246
00:26:12,741 --> 00:26:14,744
Thank you for agreeing to meet with me.

247
00:26:15,344 --> 00:26:18,114
I've decided I'll be your Mockingjay.

248
00:26:18,215 --> 00:26:21,648
But I have some conditions.

249
00:26:27,422 --> 00:26:31,661
Peeta and the other Tributes,
Johanna Mason and Annie Cresta,

250
00:26:31,761 --> 00:26:34,263
will be rescued
at the earliest opportunity.

251
00:26:34,363 --> 00:26:39,168
If and when Peeta is liberated, he will
receive a full and unconditional pardon.

252
00:26:39,268 --> 00:26:44,169
No punishment will be inflicted.
And the same goes for the other Tributes.

253
00:26:47,943 --> 00:26:49,001
No.

254
00:26:50,178 --> 00:26:52,682
It's not their fault
you abandoned them in the arena.

255
00:26:52,782 --> 00:26:55,083
They're doing and saying
whatever they can to survive.

256
00:26:55,183 --> 00:26:57,654
Individuals don't make demands in 13.

257
00:26:57,854 --> 00:27:01,588
There will be a tribunal.
And a fair judgment.

258
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:03,157
Thank you.

259
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,362
The Victors will be granted immunity.

260
00:27:06,462 --> 00:27:09,933
And you will announce that
in front of the entire population of 13.

261
00:27:10,033 --> 00:27:12,702
You will hold yourself
and your government responsible

262
00:27:12,802 --> 00:27:15,171
or you will find another Mockingjay.

263
00:27:15,272 --> 00:27:18,608
That's it. That's her. Right there.

264
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:22,479
Isn't that who I promised you?
She wears the costume.

265
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:25,148
Gunfire in the background.
A hint of smoke.

266
00:27:25,248 --> 00:27:26,880
Our Mockingjay.

267
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:31,821
Madam President, we're losing ground,
because the people are losing heart.

268
00:27:31,922 --> 00:27:34,857
This is worth the risk.
She's worth the risk.

269
00:27:34,957 --> 00:27:37,427
Pardons, tribunals. Power of the people.

270
00:27:37,527 --> 00:27:40,897
It can all be the bedrock
of the new Panem, but,

271
00:27:40,997 --> 00:27:45,832
in wartime I think even the noblest of
causes can be bent a little bit. Right?

272
00:27:50,405 --> 00:27:53,273
Do you have any other conditions?

273
00:27:58,245 --> 00:28:00,315
My sister gets to keep her cat.

274
00:28:15,563 --> 00:28:17,151
Go away.

275
00:28:21,604 --> 00:28:23,870
Is it visiting hours again?

276
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,773
Miss Trinket,

277
00:28:28,244 --> 00:28:30,279
you see this door.

278
00:28:30,379 --> 00:28:32,983
It opens. From the inside.

279
00:28:33,482 --> 00:28:36,820
I've told you, these are the standard
living quarters. Same as everyone.

280
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,655
You're not a prisoner.
You're free to join the rest of 13.

281
00:28:41,555 --> 00:28:45,262
Not looking like this.
Thank you very much.

282
00:28:45,361 --> 00:28:48,364
We have a bigger issue
than wardrobe, Miss Trinket.

283
00:28:48,463 --> 00:28:50,133
Katniss has agreed to be The Mockingjay.

284
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:54,437
- That poor thing.
- And your Girl on Fire is burnt out.

285
00:28:54,538 --> 00:28:56,903
I need you to join this team now.

286
00:28:57,405 --> 00:29:00,743
- I need someone she trusts.
- What about Haymitch?

287
00:29:00,843 --> 00:29:03,713
He's drying out in some
facility a mile down.

288
00:29:03,813 --> 00:29:07,283
Aiding rebels is not really my forte.

289
00:29:07,382 --> 00:29:12,088
Miss Trinket, your days
in the Capitol are over,

290
00:29:12,188 --> 00:29:14,359
no matter what happens here.

291
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:17,928
If you wanna play
a prisoner of war, fine.

292
00:29:18,027 --> 00:29:22,096
Stay here and rot. I'll find someone
else to be The Mockingjay's escort.

293
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,299
Who?

294
00:29:27,805 --> 00:29:31,371
Anyone can be replaced.

295
00:29:32,308 --> 00:29:34,174
Not your Mockingjay.

296
00:29:36,111 --> 00:29:40,180
There isn't a soul in this dungeon
who knows the first thing about Katniss.

297
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:47,621
You honestly believe one of these cave
dwellers is going to take my place?

298
00:29:48,023 --> 00:29:49,589
No.

299
00:30:05,206 --> 00:30:06,942
Good afternoon.

300
00:30:07,442 --> 00:30:10,180
Thank you for interrupting
your schedules.

301
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,583
They have already been
adjusted to compensate...

302
00:30:13,683 --> 00:30:15,685
I hardly ever see children around here.

303
00:30:15,785 --> 00:30:17,486
Please, check in with your unit...

304
00:30:17,586 --> 00:30:20,723
A lot of them were lost in
an epidemic a few years ago.

305
00:30:20,823 --> 00:30:23,993
- I have an announcement for the citizens of 13.
- Coin lost her family, too.

306
00:30:24,092 --> 00:30:25,661
Daughter and a husband.

307
00:30:25,761 --> 00:30:28,397
And our welcome guests from 12.

308
00:30:28,497 --> 00:30:32,903
Katniss Everdeen has consented
to be the face of our cause

309
00:30:33,002 --> 00:30:37,006
to help unite the districts
against the Capitol.

310
00:30:37,105 --> 00:30:42,711
In exchange, I have promised
several concessions.

311
00:30:43,211 --> 00:30:47,951
First, we'll assess all opportunities
for the extraction of the Victors

312
00:30:48,251 --> 00:30:50,803
held hostage in the Capitol.

313
00:30:51,586 --> 00:30:52,920
Peeta Mellark,

314
00:30:56,024 --> 00:30:58,060
Johanna Mason...

315
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,928
- Finnick, I made the deal for Annie, too.
- ...and Annie Cresta.

316
00:31:02,764 --> 00:31:07,103
Once freed, they will be granted
full pardon for any and all crimes

317
00:31:07,204 --> 00:31:09,822
committed against the rebel cause.

318
00:31:11,072 --> 00:31:12,475
Good.

319
00:31:12,875 --> 00:31:15,141
That's good, Katniss.

320
00:31:16,711 --> 00:31:20,650
If Katniss Everdeen
fails to fulfill her duties

321
00:31:20,951 --> 00:31:22,818
the deal will be off.

322
00:31:22,918 --> 00:31:27,887
Thank you for your attention.
Please, resume your daily schedules.

323
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:33,829
- Madam President.
- Effie Trinket.

324
00:31:33,929 --> 00:31:35,464
Welcome to 13.

325
00:31:35,564 --> 00:31:38,599
Madam President,
may I say you are so very...

326
00:31:39,467 --> 00:31:41,076
concise.

327
00:31:41,637 --> 00:31:43,339
You believe that
there's more to be said?

328
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:47,276
- May I speak freely?
- You don't appear to do anything else.

329
00:31:47,576 --> 00:31:50,980
I'm only talking about salesmanship.

330
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:54,150
The thing with revolutions,
they're a tender flame.

331
00:31:54,251 --> 00:31:59,055
They need to be nurtured with
a little kindling and warmth.

332
00:31:59,155 --> 00:32:02,196
- Bit of oxygen.
- Oxygen.

333
00:32:02,425 --> 00:32:04,794
One sure way to put it out
is to smother it.

334
00:32:04,994 --> 00:32:07,806
Or to use up all the air in the room.

335
00:32:07,906 --> 00:32:09,395
Excuse me.

336
00:32:11,766 --> 00:32:15,535
You know what could use
a revolution? That hair.

337
00:32:16,871 --> 00:32:17,838
Effie?

338
00:32:23,811 --> 00:32:26,850
- What are you doing here?
- I'm a political refugee.

339
00:32:27,551 --> 00:32:31,721
- Plutarch rescued you?
- Rescued, yes, that's what he calls it.

340
00:32:31,821 --> 00:32:34,558
You and I were both in the dark.

341
00:32:34,658 --> 00:32:38,060
Now I'm condemned
to this life of jumpsuits.

342
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,664
It is wonderful to see you again.

343
00:32:43,731 --> 00:32:45,542
Can you believe this place?

344
00:32:46,334 --> 00:32:48,430
I miss coffee.

345
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:53,596
I never knew anyplace
could be so strict. I mean,

346
00:32:53,696 --> 00:32:56,342
I thought at least
in the higher ranks there'd be some...

347
00:32:57,511 --> 00:33:01,283
side action. I miss my wigs.

348
00:33:01,383 --> 00:33:05,054
Luckily, I remembered that this was
all the rage when I was coming up.

349
00:33:05,154 --> 00:33:08,587
You know, everything old
can be made new again.

350
00:33:09,357 --> 00:33:11,150
Like democracy.

351
00:33:12,726 --> 00:33:15,095
Which brings me to this.

352
00:33:23,606 --> 00:33:25,171
Cinna.

353
00:33:27,642 --> 00:33:29,375
He's dead, isn't he?

354
00:33:32,714 --> 00:33:34,147
Yes, dear.

355
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:40,756
He made Plutarch promise
not to show you this

356
00:33:40,856 --> 00:33:43,790
until you'd decided to be
The Mockingjay on your own.

357
00:33:45,326 --> 00:33:48,794
He knew the risks. As we all do.

358
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,633
He believed in this revolution.

359
00:33:55,136 --> 00:33:56,905
He believed in you.

360
00:33:57,006 --> 00:33:58,972
They're beautiful.

361
00:34:01,009 --> 00:34:05,711
They have it.
They have the Mockingjay outfit.

362
00:34:07,214 --> 00:34:12,451
There's not much of a prep team
here in 13 but we will make you

363
00:34:12,887 --> 00:34:15,589
the best-dressed rebel in history.

364
00:34:19,727 --> 00:34:21,125
Okay.

365
00:34:22,298 --> 00:34:23,564
Bring up the lights.

366
00:34:41,749 --> 00:34:43,383
Cinna's final touch.

367
00:34:47,755 --> 00:34:53,228
Everyone's either gonna wanna
kiss you, kill you, or be you.

368
00:34:53,528 --> 00:34:54,927
Perfect.

369
00:34:55,663 --> 00:34:57,199
Absolutely perfect.

370
00:34:57,299 --> 00:34:59,701
Okay. Let's bring up the setting.

371
00:35:07,275 --> 00:35:08,828
Little wind.

372
00:35:09,577 --> 00:35:12,515
Okay, Katniss, we're gonna
start you down on one knee.

373
00:35:12,616 --> 00:35:17,988
And as you rise up, you're gonna hold
your flag in the air and deliver your line.

374
00:35:18,087 --> 00:35:21,892
And remember you've just stormed
the outskirts of the Capitol

375
00:35:21,992 --> 00:35:24,026
arm-in-arm with your
brothers and sisters.

376
00:35:24,126 --> 00:35:25,224
Okay.

377
00:35:26,327 --> 00:35:28,168
Whenever you're ready.

378
00:35:31,899 --> 00:35:35,601
People of Panem,
we fight, we dare, we...

379
00:35:37,872 --> 00:35:38,974
Does she know the line?

380
00:35:39,074 --> 00:35:40,576
- I know it. I got it. I'm sorry.
- Okay, All right.

381
00:35:40,676 --> 00:35:42,546
- Let's do it again.
- She's warming up.

382
00:35:42,646 --> 00:35:45,348
All right. With energy. Go.

383
00:35:46,148 --> 00:35:51,888
People of Panem, we fight!
We dare to end this hunger for justice!

384
00:35:52,388 --> 00:35:54,558
You've just been in battle!

385
00:35:54,658 --> 00:36:00,027
I'm sorry. Excuse my outburst.
You've just been in battle.

386
00:36:00,728 --> 00:36:03,764
Let's try it again.
Whenever you're ready.

387
00:36:04,699 --> 00:36:06,802
People of Panem, we fight!

388
00:36:06,902 --> 00:36:12,172
We dare to end this hunger for justice.

389
00:36:22,685 --> 00:36:26,751
And that, my friends,
is how a revolution dies.

390
00:36:30,291 --> 00:36:32,158
Hello, Katniss.

391
00:36:35,196 --> 00:36:37,363
This how you greet an old friend?

392
00:36:38,532 --> 00:36:40,701
Maybe I don't recognize you sober.

393
00:36:42,269 --> 00:36:45,404
I guess it looks as bad as it feels.

394
00:36:46,909 --> 00:36:49,613
People of Panem, we fight!

395
00:36:49,712 --> 00:36:54,180
We dare! We end this hunger for justice!

396
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:06,295
Madam President,

397
00:37:06,495 --> 00:37:09,065
indulge me for a moment, if you would.

398
00:37:09,165 --> 00:37:14,870
Let's everybody think of one incident where
Katniss Everdeen genuinely moved you.

399
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:20,176
Not where you were jealous of her hairstyle
or her dress went up in flames

400
00:37:20,277 --> 00:37:23,212
or she made a halfway
decent shot with an arrow.

401
00:37:23,312 --> 00:37:26,916
And not where Peeta made you like her.

402
00:37:27,016 --> 00:37:32,552
No, I'd like you all to think of one moment
where she made you feel something real.

403
00:37:34,589 --> 00:37:37,660
When she volunteered
for her sister at the Reaping.

404
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,593
Excellent example.

405
00:37:40,795 --> 00:37:42,269
Okay.

406
00:37:42,831 --> 00:37:45,393
I hope that wasn't important.

407
00:37:45,493 --> 00:37:49,672
Okay. "Volunteer for sister."

408
00:37:49,771 --> 00:37:51,824
Good. What else?

409
00:37:51,924 --> 00:37:55,043
When she sang that song for little Rue.

410
00:37:55,143 --> 00:37:58,315
Oh, yeah.
Who didn't get choked up at that?

411
00:37:58,414 --> 00:38:01,149
You know, I like you better, Effie,
without all that makeup.

412
00:38:01,249 --> 00:38:03,482
Well, I like you better sober.

413
00:38:04,385 --> 00:38:06,988
When she chose Rue as an ally, as well.

414
00:38:07,088 --> 00:38:10,960
- Yes.
- Now, what do all these have in common?

415
00:38:11,259 --> 00:38:13,361
No one told her what to do.

416
00:38:13,461 --> 00:38:17,132
Unscripted, yes. So maybe we
should just leave her alone.

417
00:38:17,232 --> 00:38:19,368
And wash her face.

418
00:38:19,468 --> 00:38:21,704
She's still a girl.
You made her look 35.

419
00:38:22,504 --> 00:38:26,942
The opportunities for spontaneity
are obviously lacking below ground.

420
00:38:27,042 --> 00:38:31,248
So what you're suggesting
is we toss her into combat?

421
00:38:31,747 --> 00:38:33,715
I can't sanction putting
an untrained civilian

422
00:38:33,815 --> 00:38:37,553
in battle just for effect.
This is not the Capitol.

423
00:38:37,653 --> 00:38:40,489
That is exactly what I'm suggesting.
Put her in the field.

424
00:38:40,589 --> 00:38:43,425
- No, we can't protect her.
- It has to come from her.

425
00:38:43,525 --> 00:38:48,197
That's what people respond to.
You want a symbol for the revolution?

426
00:38:48,297 --> 00:38:50,799
She cannot be coached into it.
Trust me, I know.

427
00:38:50,899 --> 00:38:52,968
Maybe there's someplace
that's less dangerous.

428
00:38:53,068 --> 00:38:57,006
District 8. They reported heavy bombing
last week. There are no military targets left.

429
00:38:57,105 --> 00:39:01,092
- We can't guarantee her safety.
- You'll never be able to guarantee my safety.

430
00:39:01,809 --> 00:39:04,711
- I wanna go.
- And if you're killed?

431
00:39:06,113 --> 00:39:07,981
Make sure you get it on camera.

432
00:39:11,919 --> 00:39:14,353
I've made you some surprises.

433
00:39:20,261 --> 00:39:22,194
Maybe you wanna try one out.

434
00:39:23,631 --> 00:39:27,133
If you're gonna be a part of Katniss'
propo team, you may as well look the part.

435
00:39:41,115 --> 00:39:45,017
And this one is for you.

436
00:39:47,288 --> 00:39:51,242
Plutarch wanted you to have a weapon
for the sake of the propos but...

437
00:39:51,342 --> 00:39:54,269
I couldn't just make you
a fashion accessory.

438
00:39:56,831 --> 00:39:58,298
It's beautiful.

439
00:40:00,668 --> 00:40:02,802
And look here.

440
00:40:07,608 --> 00:40:12,581
Regular. Incendiary. Explosive arrows.
All color-coded.

441
00:40:13,281 --> 00:40:16,652
And tell Finnick

442
00:40:16,752 --> 00:40:20,354
I've got a trident for him
when he's ready.

443
00:40:21,022 --> 00:40:23,656
Might just cheer him... Cheer him up.

444
00:40:25,794 --> 00:40:29,795
Let's not fire the red ones in here.

445
00:40:47,281 --> 00:40:51,684
You had all of this and you just left
the districts to fend for themselves?

446
00:40:52,452 --> 00:40:55,991
It's not that simple, Katniss.
We barely survived.

447
00:40:56,091 --> 00:40:58,961
We weren't in any kind of shape
to launch a counterattack.

448
00:40:59,261 --> 00:41:01,497
Yeah, we could've bombed the Capitol
but they would've retaliated

449
00:41:01,597 --> 00:41:04,370
with at least twice the firepower.
Then what?

450
00:41:06,035 --> 00:41:08,737
There would've been nobody
left to claim victory.

451
00:41:08,837 --> 00:41:12,505
Sounds like exactly what Peeta said
and then you all called him a traitor.

452
00:41:15,376 --> 00:41:17,143
This way, soldier.

453
00:41:18,544 --> 00:41:20,980
You are camera-ready.

454
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:25,583
Doesn't your comrade look handsome?

455
00:41:28,056 --> 00:41:29,606
Let's go.

456
00:41:31,826 --> 00:41:33,588
Come back safe.

457
00:41:35,096 --> 00:41:37,498
Quick introductions, Katniss.

458
00:41:37,598 --> 00:41:41,036
These people have come a long way to
support the cause. This is Cressida.

459
00:41:41,136 --> 00:41:44,340
In my opinion one of the best
up-and-coming directors in the Capitol.

460
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:48,143
- Until I up and left. Hey.
- Hey.

461
00:41:48,244 --> 00:41:51,351
Let's see what you can do. Be careful.

462
00:41:52,113 --> 00:41:55,618
- This is my assistant, Messalla.
- It's an honor to meet you.

463
00:41:55,717 --> 00:41:58,821
- And your cameramen over there, Castor.
- Hello.

464
00:41:58,921 --> 00:42:00,520
And Pollux.

465
00:42:02,824 --> 00:42:04,789
Let's get locked in.

466
00:42:11,332 --> 00:42:14,002
You're all from the Capitol?
Plutarch got you out?

467
00:42:14,101 --> 00:42:16,272
Don't expect much chitchat from him.

468
00:42:16,371 --> 00:42:20,075
He's an Avox.
Capitol cut his tongue out years ago.

469
00:42:20,175 --> 00:42:25,209
And, no, it wasn't any sort of rescue,
if that's what you mean.

470
00:42:25,945 --> 00:42:30,019
We all fled on our own. For this.

471
00:42:30,118 --> 00:42:31,084
For you.

472
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:05,432
This has gotta be fast. In and out.

473
00:43:23,237 --> 00:43:24,901
Move out.

474
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:38,454
You're alive then. We weren't sure.

475
00:43:38,654 --> 00:43:40,789
Katniss, Commander Paylor, District 8.

476
00:43:40,889 --> 00:43:42,690
Katniss has been recovering,
but she insisted on coming out

477
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:45,258
- and seein' some of your wounded.
- Well, we've got plenty of those.

478
00:43:55,603 --> 00:43:58,105
We have a mass grave
a few blocks west, but,

479
00:43:58,205 --> 00:44:01,108
I can't spare the manpower
to move them yet.

480
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:03,245
Hospital's past that curtain.

481
00:44:03,345 --> 00:44:05,647
Any hope you can give them,
it's worth it.

482
00:44:05,746 --> 00:44:08,584
The Capitol's done everything
they can to break us.

483
00:44:08,984 --> 00:44:11,353
Aren't you worried about having
all your wounded in one place?

484
00:44:11,453 --> 00:44:14,053
I think it's better
than leaving them to die.

485
00:44:14,153 --> 00:44:17,526
- That's not what I meant.
- Well, that's my only other option.

486
00:44:17,726 --> 00:44:20,659
If you can come up with another,
I'm all ears.

487
00:44:21,061 --> 00:44:22,927
It's right through here.

488
00:44:35,009 --> 00:44:38,744
Don't film me in there.
I can't help them.

489
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,014
Just let them see your face.

490
00:44:58,165 --> 00:44:59,632
Excuse me.

491
00:45:05,506 --> 00:45:07,341
- Yeah.
- You all right?

492
00:45:08,908 --> 00:45:10,178
It's okay. Here, it's okay.

493
00:45:10,278 --> 00:45:12,552
I've got you. I've got you.
It's all right.

494
00:45:42,609 --> 00:45:44,977
Katniss Everdeen?

495
00:45:48,515 --> 00:45:50,648
What are you doing here?

496
00:45:51,752 --> 00:45:54,340
I came to see you.

497
00:45:55,422 --> 00:45:57,490
What about the baby?

498
00:46:02,897 --> 00:46:06,147
- I lost it.
- Are you fighting, Katniss?

499
00:46:08,803 --> 00:46:10,453
You here to fight with us?

500
00:46:11,704 --> 00:46:13,239
I am.

501
00:46:14,707 --> 00:46:16,375
I will.

502
00:46:36,163 --> 00:46:37,514
Tighter.

503
00:46:38,132 --> 00:46:39,799
Tighter, tighter.

504
00:46:48,208 --> 00:46:51,780
Sir, some cameras
were damaged in the bombings,

505
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:55,581
but we confirmed it's her.

506
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,351
Zoom in.

507
00:47:06,761 --> 00:47:11,430
She was visiting a makeshift hospital.
We're not sure if she's still there.

508
00:47:15,102 --> 00:47:17,640
We can scramble hovercraft
from the border of 11.

509
00:47:17,739 --> 00:47:20,215
We may be able to target her.

510
00:47:22,143 --> 00:47:23,455
Kill the wounded.

511
00:47:23,745 --> 00:47:25,289
Sir...

512
00:47:26,513 --> 00:47:29,314
You wrote that speech yourself, Egeria.

513
00:47:29,984 --> 00:47:33,321
Any association with
the Mockingjay symbol

514
00:47:33,421 --> 00:47:35,482
is forbidden.

515
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:39,959
Everyone inside that hospital
has committed treason.

516
00:47:41,862 --> 00:47:46,502
Show them what it costs
to be friends with Katniss Everdeen.

517
00:47:46,902 --> 00:47:49,672
Your mom's gonna be proud of you
when she sees the footage.

518
00:47:49,771 --> 00:47:54,076
- Will this play in the districts?
- It'll be tattooed on their eyes.

519
00:47:54,476 --> 00:47:57,513
- There's a problem.
- What kinda problem?

520
00:47:58,113 --> 00:47:59,982
Incoming bombers from the north.

521
00:48:00,482 --> 00:48:03,515
- We need to find cover now.
- There's a bunker in there.

522
00:48:16,764 --> 00:48:18,897
Straight ahead and down the stairs.

523
00:48:20,301 --> 00:48:21,983
Katniss!

524
00:48:22,083 --> 00:48:23,502
Katniss!

525
00:48:24,605 --> 00:48:26,304
Everdeen!

526
00:48:26,802 --> 00:48:28,204
Everdeen!

527
00:48:28,676 --> 00:48:30,243
Gale, back away from the wall!

528
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,871
You okay?

529
00:48:54,168 --> 00:48:55,510
Move!

530
00:49:02,843 --> 00:49:05,746
- They're going after something to the south.
- That's towards the hospital.

531
00:49:10,451 --> 00:49:13,452
They're circling back around. Come on!

532
00:49:51,958 --> 00:49:55,359
That's the hospital.
They're targeting the hospital.

533
00:50:49,416 --> 00:50:51,152
Help them!

534
00:50:51,452 --> 00:50:53,119
Help them! Get them out!

535
00:50:55,688 --> 00:50:57,626
Katniss?

536
00:50:57,927 --> 00:51:00,792
Katniss, can you tell everyone
what you're seeing right now?

537
00:51:04,131 --> 00:51:06,365
Katniss, what do you wanna say?

538
00:51:16,678 --> 00:51:19,343
I want the rebels
to know that I'm alive.

539
00:51:20,013 --> 00:51:22,117
That I'm in District 8

540
00:51:22,217 --> 00:51:25,287
where the Capitol just bombed a hospital

541
00:51:25,387 --> 00:51:29,692
filled with unarmed men,
women and children.

542
00:51:30,391 --> 00:51:32,058
And there will be no survivors.

543
00:51:34,361 --> 00:51:39,433
If you think for one second that
the Capitol will ever treat us fairly

544
00:51:39,533 --> 00:51:41,536
you are lying to yourselves.

545
00:51:42,136 --> 00:51:45,085
Because we know who they are
and what they do.

546
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:49,842
This is what they do!
And we must fight back.

547
00:51:54,681 --> 00:51:57,652
I have a message for President Snow.

548
00:51:57,752 --> 00:52:02,822
You can torture us and bomb us
and burn our districts to the ground.

549
00:52:04,057 --> 00:52:06,291
But do you see that?

550
00:52:07,094 --> 00:52:09,038
Fire is catching.

551
00:52:09,929 --> 00:52:14,266
And if we burn, you burn with us!

552
00:52:34,921 --> 00:52:37,660
We know who they are and what they do.

553
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:40,562
This is what they do!

554
00:52:40,663 --> 00:52:42,836
And we must fight back.

555
00:52:43,897 --> 00:52:47,235
You can torture us and bomb us

556
00:52:47,635 --> 00:52:49,939
and burn our districts to the ground.

557
00:52:50,038 --> 00:52:51,806
Plutarch's faith in you
wasn't misplaced.

558
00:52:51,906 --> 00:52:54,542
- But do you see that?
- Thank you.

559
00:52:54,642 --> 00:52:57,479
- Fire is catching.
- Come up with me for the beginning.

560
00:52:57,580 --> 00:53:01,269
And if we burn, you burn with us!

561
00:53:29,242 --> 00:53:33,178
There is no progress without compromise.

562
00:53:33,546 --> 00:53:36,614
No victory without sacrifice.

563
00:53:37,384 --> 00:53:40,555
But I stand here with The Mockingjay

564
00:53:40,655 --> 00:53:44,657
to announce that our moment has arrived.

565
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:14,933
Beetee has increased
our use of the airwaves tenfold.

566
00:54:15,155 --> 00:54:19,327
We will broadcast this message
to all the districts tonight.

567
00:54:19,427 --> 00:54:25,320
The Mockingjay's words inspiring
everyone to join the rebellion.

568
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:29,070
Together, we will become

569
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:31,237
an alliance to be reckoned with.

570
00:54:33,441 --> 00:54:36,110
Hoorah! Hoorah! Hoorah!

571
00:54:40,647 --> 00:54:43,115
You don't like hearing
a fight song at a funeral?

572
00:54:45,385 --> 00:54:48,854
The more people on our side,
the closer we are to Peeta and Annie.

573
00:54:51,791 --> 00:54:53,358
Yeah.

574
00:55:13,146 --> 00:55:18,753
By order of President Snow daily production
quotas have been increased.

575
00:55:18,853 --> 00:55:22,957
All work shifts will be extended
by an extra two hours.

576
00:55:23,057 --> 00:55:26,525
Failure to meet these quotas
will not be tolerated.

577
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:32,465
By order of President Snow daily
production quotas have been increased.

578
00:56:18,078 --> 00:56:21,479
If we burn, you burn with us!

579
00:56:24,384 --> 00:56:25,792
Yeah!

580
00:56:27,922 --> 00:56:29,454
Yeah!

581
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:52,080
- I got good news.
- What?

582
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:53,846
Coin agreed to let us hunt above ground.

583
00:57:45,899 --> 00:57:48,475
He's not even afraid of us.

584
00:57:50,137 --> 00:57:52,570
It's 'cause they've
never been hunted before.

585
00:57:54,607 --> 00:57:56,675
It's almost not fair.

586
00:59:08,915 --> 00:59:10,640
They want us back.

587
00:59:25,365 --> 00:59:29,234
- They asked us to head for Command.
- All right. I gotta drop these off.

588
00:59:34,439 --> 00:59:36,811
She was arguably

589
00:59:37,211 --> 00:59:39,347
our favorite Tribute.

590
00:59:39,447 --> 00:59:43,584
And I think that's what
we all find most astonishing,

591
00:59:43,685 --> 00:59:48,687
is that this girl was
adored in the Capitol.

592
00:59:49,254 --> 00:59:54,247
And I think for you, Peeta,
it must be particularly painful.

593
00:59:54,729 --> 00:59:56,864
I wish I could give
this rose to you, Katniss.

594
00:59:56,965 --> 00:59:59,167
He's changed so much already.
What are they doing to him?

595
00:59:59,267 --> 01:00:04,092
A sweet gesture for a girl
who has inspired such violence.

596
01:00:04,505 --> 01:00:06,207
You must love her very much
to be able to forgive her.

597
01:00:06,307 --> 01:00:08,276
- He's shaking.
- I don't think that I could.

598
01:00:08,746 --> 01:00:12,113
Unless, of course, Peeta,
you think that perhaps she's being

599
01:00:12,213 --> 01:00:17,382
forced into saying things that
she doesn't even understand.

600
01:00:19,219 --> 01:00:21,723
Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly what I think.

601
01:00:21,822 --> 01:00:25,927
- Even his voice is different.
- I think they're using her to whip up the rebels.

602
01:00:26,027 --> 01:00:29,864
I doubt she even knows what's happening.
And what's really at stake.

603
01:00:30,064 --> 01:00:32,872
Now, Peeta, I doubt that the rebels
will ever let her see this.

604
01:00:33,668 --> 01:00:36,371
But if they do,
what would you say to her?

605
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:40,638
To Katniss Everdeen, the once sweet
Katniss Everdeen. What would you say to her?

606
01:00:41,074 --> 01:00:43,444
I would... I would tell her
to think for herself.

607
01:00:43,744 --> 01:00:45,290
Yes.

608
01:00:48,481 --> 01:00:53,521
Don't be a fool, Katniss.
I know you never wanted the rebellion.

609
01:00:53,621 --> 01:00:59,652
The things that you did in the Games
were never intended to start all of this.

610
01:01:00,261 --> 01:01:02,630
The rebels have made you
into something that you're not.

611
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:04,866
Something that could destroy all of us.

612
01:01:05,166 --> 01:01:08,903
So if you have any power or any say

613
01:01:09,003 --> 01:01:11,836
in what they do or how they use you,

614
01:01:13,106 --> 01:01:18,611
please, please, urge them to stop
this war before it's too late.

615
01:01:18,711 --> 01:01:23,281
And ask yourself, can you trust
the people you're working with?

616
01:01:25,285 --> 01:01:28,990
- Do you know what they really want?
- We need to respond.

617
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:34,529
Thank you, Peeta Mellark, for these
revelations about the real Mockingjay.

618
01:01:34,629 --> 01:01:37,565
- Did you see what he looks like?
- I saw a coward.

619
01:01:37,665 --> 01:01:40,192
- You don't have any idea what he's going through.
- I don't care.

620
01:01:40,292 --> 01:01:43,103
I would never say what he just said.

621
01:01:43,203 --> 01:01:45,538
Not if they tortured me.
Not with a gun to my head.

622
01:01:45,638 --> 01:01:48,608
That is the same Peeta that
defended you at the whipping post.

623
01:01:48,709 --> 01:01:51,910
No, it's not.
Now he's only defending himself.

624
01:01:53,648 --> 01:01:55,605
Coin's called a meeting.
We need to respond.

625
01:01:55,705 --> 01:01:58,284
When did "we" become you and Coin?

626
01:01:58,384 --> 01:02:00,121
Everyone has a choice.

627
01:02:00,221 --> 01:02:03,213
How can he sit there in the Capitol and
defend the people who destroyed his home

628
01:02:03,313 --> 01:02:05,656
and murdered his family?

629
01:02:05,757 --> 01:02:07,124
He doesn't know.

630
01:02:08,227 --> 01:02:12,610
How could he? Nobody's seen
what the Capitol did to 12.

631
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,833
I have to show them.

632
01:02:29,916 --> 01:02:33,551
So I wanna start with you
in front of the Justice Building, okay?

633
01:02:37,557 --> 01:02:39,492
Bang. First shot.

634
01:02:51,871 --> 01:02:54,428
Katniss, tell us what happened here.

635
01:02:57,477 --> 01:02:59,914
We were all standin' right here

636
01:03:04,183 --> 01:03:06,418
watchin' the Games
when you fired that arrow.

637
01:03:07,921 --> 01:03:11,808
The screens just went dark.
Nobody had any idea what happened.

638
01:03:13,326 --> 01:03:15,965
Peacekeepers forced us
back into our homes.

639
01:03:16,764 --> 01:03:19,731
For maybe an hour,
the town was just dead quiet.

640
01:03:22,802 --> 01:03:25,705
Little past 9:00,
we heard their trucks pullin' out.

641
01:03:28,173 --> 01:03:30,975
All of them. Every single Peacekeeper.

642
01:03:33,246 --> 01:03:35,245
And I knew what that meant.

643
01:03:39,319 --> 01:03:42,323
Me and a couple of guys from the mines,
we started pulling people from their houses

644
01:03:42,423 --> 01:03:47,058
and tried to get 'em to the fence line but
a lotta people were scared of the forest.

645
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:52,063
So they headed up onto the road.
Make a break for it that way.

646
01:04:00,907 --> 01:04:02,703
Stay with Gale.

647
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:10,212
915 of us made it to the fence.

648
01:04:11,551 --> 01:04:13,600
Then we watched as...

649
01:04:14,265 --> 01:04:17,019
bombers circled back towards the road.

650
01:04:21,593 --> 01:04:24,362
They firebombed them as they ran away.

651
01:04:40,712 --> 01:04:43,531
915 outta 10,000.

652
01:04:50,289 --> 01:04:53,391
I should've grabbed people.
I should've dragged 'em with me.

653
01:04:55,361 --> 01:05:00,063
- Some of the kids I could've carried.
- You saved so many people, Gale.

654
01:05:00,733 --> 01:05:04,603
Without you, there would be no District 12.
Not even the memory of it.

655
01:05:37,470 --> 01:05:39,537
This is where you kissed me.

656
01:05:40,306 --> 01:05:42,375
I didn't think you remembered that.

657
01:05:52,019 --> 01:05:54,786
I'd have to be dead to forget that.

658
01:05:56,923 --> 01:05:58,327
Maybe not even then.

659
01:06:13,006 --> 01:06:14,839
I knew you'd do that.

660
01:06:15,908 --> 01:06:17,876
How? I didn't.

661
01:06:18,779 --> 01:06:20,844
'Cause I'm in pain.

662
01:06:24,017 --> 01:06:26,751
That's the only way
that I can get your attention.

663
01:06:31,257 --> 01:06:34,399
Don't worry, Katniss. It'll pass.

664
01:06:55,314 --> 01:06:56,711
Hey.

665
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:08,592
Yeah, that's a mockingjay.

666
01:07:23,843 --> 01:07:26,115
Well, now they'll never shut up.

667
01:07:31,417 --> 01:07:32,851
You want me to sing?

668
01:07:44,047 --> 01:07:47,127
<i>Are you, are you</i>

669
01:07:47,227 --> 01:07:49,195
<i>Coming to the tree</i>

670
01:07:49,696 --> 01:07:52,171
<i>They strung up a man</i>

671
01:07:52,471 --> 01:07:55,097
<i>They say who murdered three</i>

672
01:07:55,197 --> 01:08:00,131
<i>Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be</i>

673
01:08:00,231 --> 01:08:03,350
<i>If we met at midnight</i>

674
01:08:03,450 --> 01:08:05,257
<i>In the hanging tree</i>

675
01:08:06,057 --> 01:08:08,885
<i>Are you, are you</i>

676
01:08:08,984 --> 01:08:11,433
<i>Coming to the tree</i>

677
01:08:11,533 --> 01:08:17,060
<i>Where the dead man called out
for his love to flee</i>

678
01:08:17,161 --> 01:08:22,190
<i>Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be</i>

679
01:08:22,289 --> 01:08:25,496
<i>If we met at midnight</i>

680
01:08:25,596 --> 01:08:27,836
<i>In the hanging tree</i>

681
01:08:28,036 --> 01:08:30,881
<i>Are you, are you</i>

682
01:08:30,981 --> 01:08:33,319
<i>Coming to the tree</i>

683
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:35,580
<i>Where I told you to run</i>

684
01:08:35,978 --> 01:08:38,956
<i>So we'd both be free</i>

685
01:08:39,056 --> 01:08:44,074
<i>Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be</i>

686
01:08:44,174 --> 01:08:47,285
<i>If we met at midnight</i>

687
01:08:47,386 --> 01:08:49,609
<i>In the hanging tree.</i>

688
01:08:57,671 --> 01:09:00,040
That line was originally
"necklace of rope."

689
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:02,509
I had it changed to "necklace of hope."

690
01:09:02,609 --> 01:09:05,512
Wow. You are a true wordsmith.

691
01:09:05,612 --> 01:09:08,081
Little on the nose, but,
of course, so is war.

692
01:09:08,181 --> 01:09:11,983
- Every district's seeing this?
- Yes. But not the Capitol.

693
01:09:13,052 --> 01:09:16,023
I designed this signal
defense system for them.

694
01:09:16,122 --> 01:09:17,891
But I can't find my way through it.

695
01:09:18,491 --> 01:09:20,428
Guess I did my job too well.

696
01:09:20,928 --> 01:09:24,061
At the time, I was just thinking
of the science of it all.

697
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:27,520
We'll get through it.

698
01:11:57,717 --> 01:12:03,088
Moves and countermoves.

699
01:12:25,745 --> 01:12:29,046
Katniss, you're wanted in Command.

700
01:12:36,989 --> 01:12:40,193
Tonight, we've received reports

701
01:12:40,293 --> 01:12:42,362
of derailed trains,

702
01:12:42,462 --> 01:12:44,365
of granaries on fire,

703
01:12:44,965 --> 01:12:49,503
and of a savage attack on the
hydroelectric dam in District 5.

704
01:12:49,603 --> 01:12:51,571
What have they done to you?

705
01:12:51,672 --> 01:12:56,610
I'm begging for restraint and decency.

706
01:12:56,710 --> 01:12:59,546
We interrupt your regularly
scheduled horse manure

707
01:12:59,646 --> 01:13:01,745
to bring you...

708
01:13:06,352 --> 01:13:09,053
- That's it. That's our footage.
- Beetee's in.

709
01:13:11,191 --> 01:13:13,992
- Katniss?
- He sees it. He sees our propo.

710
01:13:17,696 --> 01:13:19,637
- Katniss, are you there?
- Peeta.

711
01:13:20,701 --> 01:13:22,466
Katniss?

712
01:13:24,837 --> 01:13:27,558
Peeta, please continue.

713
01:13:28,708 --> 01:13:32,176
You were telling us about
these savage attacks.

714
01:13:32,678 --> 01:13:34,028
Yeah.

715
01:13:38,084 --> 01:13:41,214
The attack on the dam

716
01:13:41,614 --> 01:13:42,732
was a callous

717
01:13:43,889 --> 01:13:47,425
and inhuman act of destruction...

718
01:13:54,533 --> 01:13:56,169
Think about it.

719
01:13:56,703 --> 01:14:01,141
How will this end? What will be left?

720
01:14:01,441 --> 01:14:03,174
No one can survive this.

721
01:14:04,510 --> 01:14:08,412
No one is safe now.
Not here in the Capitol.

722
01:14:09,448 --> 01:14:10,933
Not in any of the districts.

723
01:14:15,454 --> 01:14:17,991
They're coming, Katniss.
They're gonna kill everyone.

724
01:14:18,091 --> 01:14:20,286
And in District 13
you'll be dead by morning.

725
01:14:21,193 --> 01:14:24,798
- He's warning us. That was a warning.
- Yes, it was.

726
01:14:24,898 --> 01:14:26,354
We have to get him out
before they kill him.

727
01:14:26,454 --> 01:14:29,002
- Is there anything in the air?
- Nothing on Doppler, ma'am.

728
01:14:29,102 --> 01:14:30,737
He was in the mansion.
He could have overheard something.

729
01:14:30,937 --> 01:14:32,137
Possibly.

730
01:14:36,442 --> 01:14:38,510
It's time for an air raid drill.

731
01:14:46,819 --> 01:14:52,890
This is a code red alert. Please,
remain calm and begin evacuation protocol.

732
01:14:55,061 --> 01:14:58,164
- Prim! Prim!
- Proceed to your nearest stairwell

733
01:14:58,264 --> 01:15:00,600
and descend to level 40.

734
01:15:00,701 --> 01:15:03,934
Blast doors will be
sealed in six minutes.

735
01:15:05,471 --> 01:15:11,578
This is a code red alert. Please,
remain calm and begin evacuation protocol.

736
01:15:11,678 --> 01:15:16,550
Proceed in an orderly fashion to your
nearest stairwell and descend to level 40.

737
01:15:17,451 --> 01:15:22,089
Madam President, three Capitol
squadrons just entered our airspace.

738
01:15:22,188 --> 01:15:25,789
- How much time do we have?
- They're a few seconds from range.

739
01:15:30,662 --> 01:15:33,100
- Prepare to scramble the fleet.
- Copy that.

740
01:15:33,199 --> 01:15:35,866
Open up short-range air defense.

741
01:15:40,806 --> 01:15:43,609
Arm long-range missiles
for counterattack.

742
01:15:53,085 --> 01:15:59,159
This is a code red alert. Please,
remain calm and begin evacuation protocol.

743
01:15:59,259 --> 01:16:03,864
Proceed in an orderly fashion to your
nearest stairwell and descend to level 40.

744
01:16:04,464 --> 01:16:06,136
Blast doors...

745
01:16:10,736 --> 01:16:14,474
This is a code red alert.
Please, remain calm...

746
01:16:30,254 --> 01:16:34,394
This is a code red alert.
Proceed in an orderly fashion...

747
01:16:34,746 --> 01:16:37,728
Come on. Come on, hon.

748
01:16:46,672 --> 01:16:49,743
Continue to the Supply Station
and claim one pack

749
01:16:49,843 --> 01:16:52,112
for each member of your compartment.

750
01:16:52,713 --> 01:16:56,650
Please keep all personal items
within your assigned area.

751
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:59,818
Be courteous to your fellow citizens.

752
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:03,657
This is a code red alert.

753
01:17:03,757 --> 01:17:07,094
All citizens should be
inside the bunker.

754
01:17:07,193 --> 01:17:10,326
- Blast doors will close in two minutes.
- Mom!

755
01:17:13,265 --> 01:17:16,036
- Where's Prim?
- I thought she went to find you.

756
01:17:16,136 --> 01:17:19,104
- She must still be on the stairs.
- There's no one on the stairs.

757
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:24,077
She went back for the cat.

758
01:17:24,177 --> 01:17:25,912
This is a code red alert.

759
01:17:26,312 --> 01:17:28,548
All citizens should be
inside the bunker.

760
01:17:28,648 --> 01:17:29,787
Hey, stop! Stop!

761
01:17:29,887 --> 01:17:33,450
Blast doors will close in one minute.

762
01:17:39,459 --> 01:17:42,396
They hit the far edge of the
northwest quadrant. Penetrated 40 feet.

763
01:17:42,495 --> 01:17:46,065
Missed the living quarters.
Only minor damage to corridors 2 and 3.

764
01:17:46,165 --> 01:17:47,826
- Is there any radiation?
- None detected.

765
01:17:47,926 --> 01:17:50,171
Doppler shows a fourth wave approaching.

766
01:17:51,071 --> 01:17:55,239
- Blast doors will close in 30 seconds.
- Prim!

767
01:17:57,909 --> 01:18:00,376
- Prim!
- Katniss!

768
01:18:06,118 --> 01:18:08,572
- This is a code red alert.
- Katniss!

769
01:18:08,672 --> 01:18:11,291
- Blast doors will close in 15 seconds.
- Keep moving, keep moving!

770
01:18:11,391 --> 01:18:12,590
Get down here!

771
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:16,161
- Hurry!
- This is a code red alert.

772
01:18:16,261 --> 01:18:20,097
- Come on!
- Blast doors will close in 10 seconds.

773
01:18:20,499 --> 01:18:21,764
Nine...

774
01:18:22,567 --> 01:18:24,134
- Eight...
- Come on!

775
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:26,382
Seven...

776
01:18:27,306 --> 01:18:28,772
Six...

777
01:18:29,975 --> 01:18:32,212
- Five...
- Hold the doors!

778
01:18:32,312 --> 01:18:33,613
Four...

779
01:18:34,947 --> 01:18:36,511
Three...

780
01:18:37,517 --> 01:18:39,883
- Two...
- Wait! Hold the doors!

781
01:18:40,086 --> 01:18:41,033
One.

782
01:18:42,955 --> 01:18:45,225
You went back for the cat?
What were you thinking?

783
01:18:45,325 --> 01:18:48,390
I wasn't gonna leave him behind.
I couldn't live with myself.

784
01:18:49,363 --> 01:18:51,365
Blast doors are now sealed.

785
01:18:51,464 --> 01:18:53,288
I know, Prim.

786
01:18:58,335 --> 01:18:59,702
Let's go.

787
01:19:02,642 --> 01:19:06,211
Damage to the aquifer in the northwest
quadrant. We lost a transport corridor.

788
01:19:06,311 --> 01:19:07,947
There's nothing else in the northwest.

789
01:19:08,047 --> 01:19:11,251
Our surface-to-air launchers
just took a direct hit in sector 3.

790
01:19:11,351 --> 01:19:15,170
Because we revealed ourselves.
They saw us firing there.

791
01:19:18,623 --> 01:19:20,460
Stand down. Don't launch the fleet.

792
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:25,264
Another 12 Capitol bombers approaching
sector 3 in attack formation.

793
01:19:25,364 --> 01:19:27,698
Hold fire on their approach.

794
01:19:31,504 --> 01:19:32,497
What'd they hit?

795
01:19:32,597 --> 01:19:35,042
Bedrock. But there's debris
in the ventilation shaft.

796
01:19:35,141 --> 01:19:37,778
- They're not targeting our fleet.
- Or our Special Weaponry.

797
01:19:37,878 --> 01:19:39,980
They don't know what we have
or where we have it.

798
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:42,348
Can you confirm that everyone's
safely in the bunker?

799
01:19:42,448 --> 01:19:43,713
Already done.

800
01:19:44,517 --> 01:19:47,053
Conceal all remaining
anti-aircraft guns.

801
01:19:47,153 --> 01:19:49,956
Seal launching pads
and ventilation corridors.

802
01:19:50,057 --> 01:19:53,459
We are gonna wait this out.
This is what we're built for.

803
01:19:53,859 --> 01:19:55,696
They'll seal us in here like a tomb.

804
01:19:55,895 --> 01:19:57,797
The Capitol's working off
some outdated information.

805
01:19:57,897 --> 01:20:01,633
- I'd rather not update it for them.
- Madam President, I know it's not my place...

806
01:20:01,733 --> 01:20:05,138
It's not. You're a welcome guest,
but you're out of your depth down here.

807
01:20:05,238 --> 01:20:09,492
- Reduce oxygen to 14% to conserve it.
- Copy that.

808
01:20:10,009 --> 01:20:13,576
Take a deep breath, Mr. Heavensbee.
It's gonna be a long night.

809
01:20:52,417 --> 01:20:55,384
Prim, talk about something. Anything.

810
01:20:58,589 --> 01:21:00,923
They promoted me at the hospital.

811
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:05,241
I forgot to tell you.
They're training me to be a doctor.

812
01:21:06,897 --> 01:21:08,966
They'd be stupid not to.

813
01:22:23,275 --> 01:22:24,886
Hey.

814
01:22:25,444 --> 01:22:28,078
- Can I sit?
- Yeah.

815
01:22:32,385 --> 01:22:35,220
Snow's using Annie to punish you.

816
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:37,654
He's taunting us with them.

817
01:22:38,889 --> 01:22:43,227
I didn't understand until just now
watching that stupid cat.

818
01:22:51,570 --> 01:22:54,240
After your first Games,

819
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:58,142
I thought the whole romance was an act.

820
01:22:59,779 --> 01:23:02,881
We all expected you
to continue that strategy.

821
01:23:03,081 --> 01:23:06,252
But it wasn't until
Peeta's heart stopped

822
01:23:06,352 --> 01:23:08,980
and he nearly died that...

823
01:23:10,589 --> 01:23:12,888
I knew I'd misjudged you.

824
01:23:13,793 --> 01:23:15,252
You love him.

825
01:23:17,361 --> 01:23:20,266
I'm not saying in what way.
Maybe you don't even know yourself.

826
01:23:20,466 --> 01:23:23,500
But anyone paying attention can see it.

827
01:23:24,402 --> 01:23:26,454
How do you live with it?

828
01:23:28,472 --> 01:23:32,912
I drag myself outta nightmares
and there's no relief in waking up.

829
01:23:33,012 --> 01:23:36,580
But... it's better not to give in to it.

830
01:23:39,051 --> 01:23:43,821
Takes 10 times longer to put yourself
back together than it does to fall apart.

831
01:23:53,632 --> 01:23:56,696
Katniss? Katniss?

832
01:23:57,635 --> 01:23:59,269
Come with me.

833
01:24:04,575 --> 01:24:07,211
We took their best shot. Didn't we?

834
01:24:08,413 --> 01:24:09,949
Yeah.

835
01:24:10,149 --> 01:24:13,386
- Your mother and sister okay?
- Yeah, they're fine.

836
01:24:13,486 --> 01:24:15,721
I need you to do something for us.

837
01:24:16,321 --> 01:24:20,126
I need you to tell Panem that we
survived an attack by the Capitol

838
01:24:20,225 --> 01:24:24,961
with no casualties.
And we remain fully operational.

839
01:24:25,663 --> 01:24:27,129
Okay.

840
01:24:27,365 --> 01:24:29,435
You should know something.

841
01:24:29,935 --> 01:24:34,705
We had eight extra minutes of civilian
evacuation because of Peeta's warning.

842
01:24:35,339 --> 01:24:36,974
I won't forget that.

843
01:24:38,242 --> 01:24:39,877
Thank you.

844
01:24:54,794 --> 01:25:00,063
So Katniss, it's "13 is alive
and well and so am I."

845
01:25:01,399 --> 01:25:02,900
Katniss?

846
01:25:04,636 --> 01:25:06,335
Katniss.

847
01:25:07,105 --> 01:25:10,040
Never one to waste it
in rehearsal, I know.

848
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:17,400
Why would they drop these?

849
01:26:20,413 --> 01:26:21,914
For me.

850
01:26:22,014 --> 01:26:24,107
Ready to go, Katniss?

851
01:26:25,183 --> 01:26:27,350
We're gonna do this,
just like District 8.

852
01:26:30,522 --> 01:26:32,688
Tell me about the roses.

853
01:26:37,696 --> 01:26:42,565
Tell Snow 13 is alive and well.

854
01:26:46,538 --> 01:26:47,873
He's gonna kill Peeta.

855
01:26:47,973 --> 01:26:50,643
Let's try again. Can you speak up?
We don't have a mic on you.

856
01:26:50,743 --> 01:26:54,745
"13 is alive and well and so am I."

857
01:26:57,882 --> 01:27:00,283
He's gonna kill Peeta.

858
01:27:02,853 --> 01:27:05,422
- I can't.
- Katniss?

859
01:27:06,826 --> 01:27:09,295
- You can do it, Katniss.
- I can't do this.

860
01:27:09,395 --> 01:27:12,598
"13 is alive and well and so am I."

861
01:27:12,698 --> 01:27:15,701
He's just gonna keep...
He's never gonna stop.

862
01:27:15,801 --> 01:27:18,504
- Cressida, we should cut the cameras.
- It's okay, Katniss.

863
01:27:18,604 --> 01:27:22,206
No. He warned me.
He warned me about this.

864
01:27:23,208 --> 01:27:26,045
He's doing this because
I'm The Mockingjay.

865
01:27:26,145 --> 01:27:28,611
He's punishing Peeta to punish me.

866
01:27:28,713 --> 01:27:30,307
No.

867
01:27:31,484 --> 01:27:33,786
- No, I can't do this.
- Katniss.

868
01:27:33,886 --> 01:27:37,456
- Don't make me do this!
- Let her go.

869
01:27:37,656 --> 01:27:41,090
I got... I gotta get out of here.

870
01:28:00,044 --> 01:28:02,915
So this is the end?

871
01:28:03,015 --> 01:28:05,816
I s'pose you're just gonna
hide down here forever?

872
01:28:06,851 --> 01:28:08,825
I can't be The Mockingjay.

873
01:28:09,423 --> 01:28:12,556
Not The Mockingjay. Just Katniss.

874
01:28:15,093 --> 01:28:19,963
You know, you're the only
real friend I have down here.

875
01:28:24,202 --> 01:28:28,708
I don't suppose they gave you
any kind of medication?

876
01:28:28,808 --> 01:28:32,844
- You're unbelievable.
- Okay, but I meant what I said.

877
01:28:33,246 --> 01:28:36,961
Look, the reason I'm here
is to let you know

878
01:28:37,281 --> 01:28:38,715
they're rescuing Peeta.

879
01:28:40,651 --> 01:28:43,155
- What?
- The dam went down in District 5,

880
01:28:43,255 --> 01:28:47,326
took out most of the power to the Capitol.
Knocked out their signal defense.

881
01:28:47,426 --> 01:28:51,794
Beetee's inside their system now,
wreaking all kinds of havoc.

882
01:28:51,896 --> 01:28:54,500
A window is open to us.
How much longer? I don't know.

883
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:57,336
I guess until the Capitol
can get the power back on.

884
01:28:57,436 --> 01:28:58,637
And President Coin?

885
01:28:58,738 --> 01:29:03,696
You know, I can never fully support
that woman in light of the...

886
01:29:03,795 --> 01:29:08,216
prohibition they have
going on around this place, but...

887
01:29:08,316 --> 01:29:12,418
Plutarch got word that Peeta and
the others are in the Tribute Center.

888
01:29:12,518 --> 01:29:15,854
And with the power out,
Coin sees this as an opportunity.

889
01:29:15,954 --> 01:29:20,025
She knows that Peeta is the Capitol's weapon.
The same way you're ours.

890
01:29:20,126 --> 01:29:23,896
And as opposed to having you two
pointing at each other,

891
01:29:23,996 --> 01:29:26,100
she's going to get him.

892
01:29:26,431 --> 01:29:29,868
- I have to go help.
- Hey, hey, whoa, kiddo. Wait.

893
01:29:29,968 --> 01:29:33,205
Come on. What, are you just gonna jump
out of the vent and go storm the Capitol?

894
01:29:33,305 --> 01:29:35,542
Besides, it's already underway.

895
01:29:36,242 --> 01:29:39,478
Six soldiers went in. Volunteer only.

896
01:29:39,578 --> 01:29:43,046
And guess who was
the first brave soul to sign up.

897
01:29:43,948 --> 01:29:45,600
Gale.

898
01:29:54,726 --> 01:29:56,829
- Okay, Finnick?
- Yeah. Yeah.

899
01:29:56,929 --> 01:29:59,071
Go in the center there.

900
01:29:59,629 --> 01:30:01,533
Those rocks.

901
01:30:04,536 --> 01:30:06,007
Castor, to the left.

902
01:30:06,806 --> 01:30:10,062
Pollux, you're with me.
So we'll go straight to camera.

903
01:30:10,976 --> 01:30:13,312
Okay? Finnick?

904
01:30:13,412 --> 01:30:14,580
Yeah.

905
01:30:14,980 --> 01:30:18,150
Okay. Take your time.

906
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:21,451
Just remember to keep talking
and don't stop.

907
01:30:24,725 --> 01:30:26,833
This is Finnick Odair.

908
01:30:27,826 --> 01:30:30,763
Winner of the 65th Hunger Games.

909
01:30:30,863 --> 01:30:34,467
And I'm coming to you
from District 13, alive and well.

910
01:30:34,566 --> 01:30:37,703
We've survived an assault
from the Capitol.

911
01:30:37,803 --> 01:30:40,539
But I'm not here
to give you recent news.

912
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:44,510
- Why is Finnick doing a propo?
- It's a lot more than that.

913
01:30:44,610 --> 01:30:48,280
- Beetee's commandeered the system.
- Now that they're down to generator power

914
01:30:48,381 --> 01:30:50,549
there's a more limited range of
frequencies available to them.

915
01:30:50,649 --> 01:30:52,485
And I'm filling them
all up with Finnick.

916
01:30:52,584 --> 01:30:55,455
Not many will see it, but whoever does
will think it's another propo.

917
01:30:55,555 --> 01:30:59,041
What they don't know is this broadcast
is jamming their entire system with noise.

918
01:30:59,141 --> 01:31:02,227
Early defense warning,
internal communications, everything.

919
01:31:02,327 --> 01:31:03,696
As long as the broadcast goes through,

920
01:31:03,796 --> 01:31:06,465
our team should be able
to get in and out undetected.

921
01:31:06,565 --> 01:31:09,435
The truth.
Not the myths about a life of luxury.

922
01:31:09,535 --> 01:31:12,805
Not the lie about glory
for your homeland.

923
01:31:12,905 --> 01:31:15,241
You can survive the arena.

924
01:31:15,341 --> 01:31:18,274
The moment you leave, you're a slave.

925
01:31:31,189 --> 01:31:35,227
Mockingjay One, Mockingjay One, you are
one minute out from perimeter defense.

926
01:31:35,669 --> 01:31:39,265
- Going dark.
- Stay low in case they're online.

927
01:31:40,165 --> 01:31:42,568
President Snow used to sell me.

928
01:31:42,668 --> 01:31:45,938
Or my body, at least.
I wasn't the only one.

929
01:31:46,038 --> 01:31:49,893
If a Victor is considered desirable,
the President gives them as a reward

930
01:31:49,993 --> 01:31:54,780
or allows people to buy them.
If you refuse, he kills someone you love.

931
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:58,581
Mockingjay One, you are 20 seconds
from perimeter defense.

932
01:32:03,888 --> 01:32:05,254
Ten seconds.

933
01:32:05,354 --> 01:32:07,159
Nine... Eight...

934
01:32:07,460 --> 01:32:10,228
Seven... Six... Five...

935
01:32:10,928 --> 01:32:13,863
Four... Three... Two...

936
01:32:14,665 --> 01:32:15,576
One.

937
01:32:24,109 --> 01:32:27,412
No response from perimeter defense.
We're inside Capitol airspace.

938
01:32:27,512 --> 01:32:31,438
To make themselves feel better, my patrons
would make presents of money or jewelry.

939
01:32:32,017 --> 01:32:36,789
But I found a much more
valuable form of payment.

940
01:32:36,889 --> 01:32:37,990
Secrets.

941
01:32:38,090 --> 01:32:39,613
Gear up.

942
01:33:00,078 --> 01:33:01,744
Switching to Night View.

943
01:33:09,921 --> 01:33:11,465
There.

944
01:33:14,225 --> 01:33:16,929
Command, we have visual
on the Tribute Center.

945
01:33:17,129 --> 01:33:19,362
Initiating final approach.

946
01:33:23,634 --> 01:33:24,968
Masks on.

947
01:33:30,141 --> 01:33:33,646
See, I know all the depravity,
the deceit and the cruelty

948
01:33:33,746 --> 01:33:36,516
of the Capitol's pampered elite.

949
01:33:37,116 --> 01:33:41,418
But the biggest secrets are about
our good President, Coriolanus Snow.

950
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:50,413
Open the door.

951
01:34:00,204 --> 01:34:01,339
Command, this is Team Leader.

952
01:34:01,539 --> 01:34:05,174
Prepare to deploy gas.
We will confirm once inside.

953
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:12,118
Such a young man when he rose to power.
Such a clever one to keep it.

954
01:34:12,217 --> 01:34:15,618
How, you may ask, did he do it?

955
01:34:17,221 --> 01:34:18,788
One word.

956
01:34:19,390 --> 01:34:20,923
Poison.

957
01:34:27,098 --> 01:34:28,946
Get ready to drop.

958
01:34:56,127 --> 01:35:00,092
He stopped every mutiny
before it even started.

959
01:35:09,941 --> 01:35:11,353
Clear.

960
01:35:14,712 --> 01:35:19,051
Clear. Command, we're inside.
Heading toward target number one.

961
01:35:19,251 --> 01:35:22,118
Cell P45 lower level 2C.

962
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:23,993
Gas.

963
01:35:24,457 --> 01:35:28,457
There are so many mysterious deaths
to adversaries.

964
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:31,394
Even to allies who were threats.

965
01:35:42,940 --> 01:35:45,711
Snow would drink from the same cup,
to deflect suspicion.

966
01:35:45,911 --> 01:35:49,014
But antidotes don't always work,

967
01:35:49,115 --> 01:35:52,017
which is why he wears roses
that reek of perfume.

968
01:35:52,217 --> 01:35:56,886
Help cover the scent of blood from sores
in his mouth that will never heal.

969
01:36:21,612 --> 01:36:23,079
Gale.

970
01:36:26,818 --> 01:36:31,457
But he can't hide the scent of who
he really is. He kills without mercy.

971
01:36:31,557 --> 01:36:34,289
He rules with deception and fear.

972
01:36:59,683 --> 01:37:03,321
His weapon of choice
is the only thing suited to such a man.

973
01:37:03,421 --> 01:37:07,557
Poison. The perfect weapon for a snake.

974
01:37:09,194 --> 01:37:10,641
What is this place?

975
01:37:21,540 --> 01:37:23,041
- Beetee?
- I'm losing them.

976
01:37:23,141 --> 01:37:24,574
Powering back up.

977
01:37:26,612 --> 01:37:30,315
Ma'am, the Capitol air defense system
is rebooting. It's coming back online.

978
01:37:30,415 --> 01:37:32,182
Must be diverting power
from another source.

979
01:37:32,282 --> 01:37:34,887
And filtering transmissions.
Another 60 seconds and we'll be cut off.

980
01:37:34,987 --> 01:37:37,152
Madam President, should we
call back the hovercraft?

981
01:37:38,955 --> 01:37:40,559
Broadcast me.

982
01:37:40,859 --> 01:37:44,463
If Snow's watching this, maybe he'll
let the signal in, if he sees me.

983
01:37:45,063 --> 01:37:46,766
Put me on the air so he can see me.

984
01:37:46,965 --> 01:37:49,468
- Yes. Yes.
- Put her on.

985
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:51,904
Can we do this? Can we still get in?

986
01:37:52,104 --> 01:37:54,473
Yes. For the moment. The line's open.
He will only see you.

987
01:37:54,673 --> 01:37:56,508
Okay, Katniss, go.

988
01:37:56,608 --> 01:37:59,478
President Snow?
President Snow. It's Katniss.

989
01:37:59,578 --> 01:38:02,547
- There's no guarantee he's even watching.
- President Snow?

990
01:38:02,647 --> 01:38:06,151
- I know, but he might be.
- President Snow, I need to speak with you.

991
01:38:06,350 --> 01:38:08,018
Are you there?

992
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:12,454
President Snow, it's Katniss.
Can you hear me?

993
01:38:13,823 --> 01:38:15,591
I need to speak with you.

994
01:38:17,529 --> 01:38:22,256
President Snow, it's Katniss.
President Snow, are you there?

995
01:38:25,935 --> 01:38:27,637
Can you hear me?

996
01:38:33,227 --> 01:38:37,479
- President Snow...
- Miss Everdeen. What an honor.

997
01:38:38,582 --> 01:38:43,419
I don't imagine you're calling
to thank me for the roses.

998
01:38:44,823 --> 01:38:46,821
I never asked for this.

999
01:38:47,758 --> 01:38:49,560
I never asked to be in the Games.

1000
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:53,361
- Boggs? Come in. Boggs?
- I never asked to be The Mockingjay.

1001
01:38:54,565 --> 01:38:58,137
Just wanted to save my sister.
And keep Peeta alive.

1002
01:38:58,537 --> 01:39:00,999
Come in. Boggs?

1003
01:39:01,741 --> 01:39:05,378
Please, just let him go.
And I will stop being The Mockingjay.

1004
01:39:05,478 --> 01:39:07,779
I will disappear. You will never
have to see me ever again.

1005
01:39:07,879 --> 01:39:08,937
Miss Everdeen.

1006
01:39:09,714 --> 01:39:13,065
- Boggs, come in.
- You couldn't run from this...

1007
01:39:13,166 --> 01:39:16,655
any more than you could have
run from the Games.

1008
01:39:16,756 --> 01:39:21,458
- Command, I need a situation report.
- Boggs, we're running out of time. Hurry.

1009
01:39:23,294 --> 01:39:24,328
Let's move.

1010
01:39:24,428 --> 01:39:25,530
Please.

1011
01:39:26,030 --> 01:39:27,938
You've won.

1012
01:39:30,734 --> 01:39:32,783
You've already beaten me.

1013
01:39:35,573 --> 01:39:38,474
Release Peeta. And take me instead.

1014
01:39:40,512 --> 01:39:43,548
We're long past the opportunity

1015
01:39:43,648 --> 01:39:45,717
for noble sacrifice.

1016
01:39:45,917 --> 01:39:49,789
Then tell me what to do.
I've always kept my promises, haven't I?

1017
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:55,491
You said you didn't want a war.
And that's just what's happened.

1018
01:39:56,293 --> 01:39:59,432
I told you what a fragile
thing peace was.

1019
01:39:59,531 --> 01:40:01,333
And still, like a child,

1020
01:40:01,733 --> 01:40:04,732
you took pleasure in breaking it.

1021
01:40:05,703 --> 01:40:07,338
I know what you are.

1022
01:40:07,738 --> 01:40:11,209
I know you can't see
past your narrowest concerns.

1023
01:40:11,409 --> 01:40:14,243
But please, Miss Everdeen.

1024
01:40:14,578 --> 01:40:17,149
I doubt you know
what honesty is anymore.

1025
01:40:17,349 --> 01:40:20,385
Command, we're at the first target.
Preparing to extract Peeta.

1026
01:40:20,485 --> 01:40:21,984
Will confirm when he's in hand.

1027
01:40:24,957 --> 01:40:27,059
Mockingjay One,
prepare hovercraft for evac.

1028
01:40:27,359 --> 01:40:30,428
You asked me to convince you
that I was in love with Peeta.

1029
01:40:30,528 --> 01:40:32,961
Haven't I at least done that?

1030
01:40:33,496 --> 01:40:35,131
Miss Everdeen,

1031
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:40,302
it's the things we love most

1032
01:40:40,604 --> 01:40:42,638
that destroy us.

1033
01:40:44,308 --> 01:40:46,000
I want you to remember

1034
01:40:47,322 --> 01:40:49,483
that I said that.

1035
01:40:53,983 --> 01:40:58,113
Don't you think I know your friends
are in the Tribute Center?

1036
01:40:59,790 --> 01:41:00,823
Cut them off.

1037
01:41:03,039 --> 01:41:04,922
- Boggs, come in.
- What happened?

1038
01:41:05,197 --> 01:41:07,532
Boggs, come in. Do you read me?

1039
01:41:07,632 --> 01:41:10,502
- He knows that they're in there. It's a trap.
- Katniss, hold it.

1040
01:41:10,602 --> 01:41:13,272
We have to get a hold of them.
We have to tell them to get out. He knows.

1041
01:41:13,372 --> 01:41:15,540
There's no signal.
We can't contact them.

1042
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:19,444
No. Haymitch, he knew the whole time.
He was taunting me.

1043
01:41:19,544 --> 01:41:22,247
- No, Haymitch. They're in there.
- No, we don't know that.

1044
01:41:22,347 --> 01:41:25,717
Did I lose them both tonight?
Did I lose them both tonight?

1045
01:41:25,817 --> 01:41:28,086
Did I lose them both tonight?

1046
01:41:28,186 --> 01:41:31,556
Did I lose them? I lost them both.

1047
01:41:31,656 --> 01:41:33,655
No! No!

1048
01:41:42,399 --> 01:41:43,833
There's no news.

1049
01:41:46,003 --> 01:41:47,602
I'm sorry.

1050
01:41:50,241 --> 01:41:53,042
It's the worst torture in the world.

1051
01:41:54,945 --> 01:41:58,181
Waiting, when you know
there's nothing you can do.

1052
01:42:03,321 --> 01:42:05,855
Especially for people like us.

1053
01:42:06,724 --> 01:42:08,783
But whatever

1054
01:42:09,164 --> 01:42:11,643
strength, courage,

1055
01:42:11,929 --> 01:42:13,863
madness,

1056
01:42:14,431 --> 01:42:18,400
keeps us going, you find it,
at times like these.

1057
01:42:21,004 --> 01:42:23,142
You have it, soldier.

1058
01:42:23,442 --> 01:42:26,576
It's what's kept you
alive all this time.

1059
01:42:27,544 --> 01:42:29,779
And it won't fail you now.

1060
01:42:51,702 --> 01:42:53,032
They're back.

1061
01:43:01,612 --> 01:43:03,248
I don't want that.

1062
01:43:07,851 --> 01:43:08,953
Johanna.

1063
01:43:09,353 --> 01:43:10,652
Finnick!

1064
01:43:11,922 --> 01:43:13,159
Finnick!

1065
01:43:13,558 --> 01:43:16,791
Annie? Annie! Annie!

1066
01:43:20,264 --> 01:43:22,697
You're safe. You're safe.

1067
01:43:29,540 --> 01:43:31,107
Gale!

1068
01:43:33,977 --> 01:43:35,644
Are you okay?

1069
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:38,250
What? What is it?

1070
01:43:38,350 --> 01:43:44,053
I don't get it. Every gun was back online
and on us and we flew right past them.

1071
01:43:44,255 --> 01:43:46,221
They let us go.

1072
01:43:51,127 --> 01:43:52,361
He's in there.

1073
01:43:54,598 --> 01:43:58,634
The gas we used on the guards knocked
him out, too, but it's wearing off now.

1074
01:44:00,303 --> 01:44:02,371
You should be there when he wakes up.

1075
01:44:07,410 --> 01:44:09,177
Thank you.

1076
01:44:11,882 --> 01:44:13,515
Thank you.

1077
01:44:33,437 --> 01:44:34,988
Peeta.

1078
01:45:08,838 --> 01:45:10,108
Peeta!

1079
01:45:10,608 --> 01:45:14,245
Peeta! Get off! Get off of her!

1080
01:45:14,345 --> 01:45:15,876
Let go!

1081
01:45:50,548 --> 01:45:52,817
No, Katniss.
No, you're swollen. Don't touch.

1082
01:45:52,917 --> 01:45:56,285
No, no, no. Calm down.
Calm down. You're okay.

1083
01:45:59,223 --> 01:46:00,889
Tell her she's awake.

1084
01:46:02,893 --> 01:46:04,629
- Pee...
- Don't try to talk.

1085
01:46:04,729 --> 01:46:06,881
Peeta's okay. I promise.

1086
01:46:07,464 --> 01:46:09,655
I just had to get him off you.

1087
01:46:16,006 --> 01:46:18,529
It's called hijacking.

1088
01:46:19,444 --> 01:46:22,372
We don't know how long the Capitol's
been doing this to Peeta.

1089
01:46:23,346 --> 01:46:27,085
It's fear conditioning.
Enhanced with tracker jacker venom.

1090
01:46:27,585 --> 01:46:30,222
You were stung your first Games.
Remember?

1091
01:46:30,722 --> 01:46:33,895
The venom puts the subject
in a dissociative state.

1092
01:46:34,758 --> 01:46:36,804
And they torture him.

1093
01:46:37,420 --> 01:46:41,733
With shocks and beatings,
and strip down his identity.

1094
01:46:41,833 --> 01:46:44,769
And then all of that suffering
and fear is redirected.

1095
01:46:44,869 --> 01:46:48,822
Associated with other memories
or a person.

1096
01:46:49,808 --> 01:46:51,976
They can change his memories of Katniss?

1097
01:46:52,076 --> 01:46:54,330
To make her seem life-threatening.

1098
01:46:55,045 --> 01:46:59,615
They turned him into a weapon, Katniss.
To kill you.

1099
01:47:01,017 --> 01:47:02,107
But you can reverse it?

1100
01:47:02,207 --> 01:47:03,988
The fear is the most difficult
thing to overcome.

1101
01:47:04,089 --> 01:47:06,924
We're hardwired to remember fear best.

1102
01:47:07,024 --> 01:47:08,925
It's new terrain.

1103
01:47:09,793 --> 01:47:12,527
But we've put together a team.

1104
01:47:12,929 --> 01:47:15,063
I'm optimistic.

1105
01:47:41,458 --> 01:47:43,221
Good evening.

1106
01:47:44,027 --> 01:47:49,000
Yesterday, I authorized a covert
rescue mission inside the Capitol.

1107
01:47:49,501 --> 01:47:52,170
I am pleased to announce

1108
01:47:52,270 --> 01:47:56,178
that the Victors have been liberated!

1109
01:48:01,645 --> 01:48:05,894
Let this day mark an historic change.

1110
01:48:06,651 --> 01:48:10,054
With The Mockingjay
and the Victors beside us,

1111
01:48:10,155 --> 01:48:13,758
we have sent a clear message
to the Capitol.

1112
01:48:13,858 --> 01:48:18,161
That we will never again
endure injustice.

1113
01:48:23,333 --> 01:48:27,707
Today, a day on which
we reunited family,

1114
01:48:28,406 --> 01:48:31,444
friends, and loved ones.

1115
01:48:31,743 --> 01:48:36,248
Let all of Panem come together.

1116
01:48:36,748 --> 01:48:40,618
Not to battle for the amusement
of the Capitol.

1117
01:48:40,718 --> 01:48:43,653
But to join hands in this fight.

1118
01:48:50,594 --> 01:48:53,264
Let today be the day we promise

1119
01:48:53,465 --> 01:48:54,988
never to give up,

1120
01:48:55,589 --> 01:49:00,038
never to give in
until we have made a new Panem,

1121
01:49:00,138 --> 01:49:04,442
where leaders are elected,
not imposed upon us.

1122
01:49:04,542 --> 01:49:08,913
And where the districts are free
to share the fruits of their labors

1123
01:49:09,013 --> 01:49:11,480
and not fight one another for scraps!

1124
01:49:24,728 --> 01:49:29,944
This new Panem is on the horizon.
But we must take it for ourselves.

1125
01:49:30,301 --> 01:49:34,572
The road there leads through
the sharp mountains

1126
01:49:34,672 --> 01:49:37,776
and deep ravines of District 2.

1127
01:49:37,875 --> 01:49:42,074
There in the heart of Panem's
steepest mountain range

1128
01:49:42,173 --> 01:49:45,848
lies the Capitol's principal
military facility.

1129
01:49:46,983 --> 01:49:49,754
We can conquer this stronghold

1130
01:49:49,854 --> 01:49:53,057
because we are one people,

1131
01:49:53,158 --> 01:49:56,795
one army, one voice.

1132
01:49:56,894 --> 01:50:01,499
Because today is our new beginning.

1133
01:50:01,599 --> 01:50:05,936
Today we have freed the Victors.

1134
01:50:06,036 --> 01:50:09,172
Tomorrow, Panem!

1135
01:50:17,347 --> 01:50:21,450
Hoorah! Hoorah! Hoorah!
