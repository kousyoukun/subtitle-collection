1
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,395
No, no.

2
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,828
First, you should find out

3
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:40,389
what is the essential nature
of the universe.

4
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:43,994
Is the universe
an inherently irrational place

5
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,129
random and chaotic?

6
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:54,012
Chipmunk, your spoon.

7
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,479
Oh.

8
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,574
Your spoon...
it's on the floor.

9
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,606
Oh!

10
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:00,141
Are you ready to order?

11
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:01,210
Uh, yes, I think.

12
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:02,949
The usual, please.

13
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:06,686
No. I'll have a cup of coffee
and a corn muffin, please.

14
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:07,693
Ow!

15
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:09,524
Darling, that is your usual.

16
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:10,688
Oh.

17
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,391
Well, I'll have that then.

18
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:13,524
Okay.

19
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:14,533
Thank you.

20
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:16,262
- Aha!
- What?

21
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:19,965
It loses 11,000 molecules
per square centimeter

22
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,404
per second.

23
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:22,408
What does?

24
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:25,309
The comet.

25
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,642
Now...

26
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,909
which one of these
do you like best?

27
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,882
Is this a personality test?

28
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,885
Mm, it's a sort of surprise.

29
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,978
They're all the same.

30
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:36,112
What? No, no.

31
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,123
Look.

32
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,181
That's aquamarine.

33
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:40,419
That's blue-green,
and that's algae.

34
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,553
Well, you know
at the atomic level

35
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:44,563
there's no such thing
as color.

36
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:46,929
Though they did
do that study

37
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:48,490
in Belgium that time...

38
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:49,661
or was it Denmark?

39
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:50,669
Babbling.

40
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:51,829
Anyway, babbling.

41
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:53,463
Anyway, the point
was that...

42
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,768
What was the point?

43
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:57,173
Oh, that since protons
are so much smaller

44
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,234
than light waves...

45
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:00,303
Algae.

46
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,370
Thank you.

47
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:04,144
Since protons are so much
smaller than light waves

48
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,812
how could they ever see it
to begin with?

49
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:13,089
Oh, those Danes.

50
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:18,029
Or is there a fundamental order
underlying all things?

51
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:24,270
Hey, Captain Marvel?

52
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:25,396
Shazam?

53
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:27,702
Oh, thanks.

54
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,675
I was just reading
about Boyd's comet.

55
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,802
Boyd's what?

56
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,072
Comet? Like in the sky?

57
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:35,103
They say it's going
to be here soon.

58
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,979
We're going to be able
to see it.

59
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:38,574
You know why a comet's tail

60
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,449
always points
away from the sun?

61
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:41,453
No.

62
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:42,545
Want to know?

63
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:43,647
- No.
- No.

64
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,954
'Cause it's actually
not a tail at all.

65
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:49,189
It's, it's bits of gas
that the sun lights up.

66
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,255
We earthlings will try
to keep that in mind.

67
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:56,564
Kind of like a 500-mile-
long Jersey torch.

68
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:57,627
Wow.

69
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,503
It must be true.

70
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,768
The fact remains

71
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,800
that certain events
are strictly accidental.

72
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:05,868
What fact?

73
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,447
Oh!

74
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:12,849
Oh, my, look at the time.

75
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:14,614
No problem.

76
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:17,812
Oh!

77
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,381
It's because it's spring.

78
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,359
Everything goes
through upheaval

79
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:23,294
in the spring,
wouldn't you say?

80
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,887
Come on, you little bitch.

81
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,259
Sounds like business.

82
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,267
M.G.T.F. Roadster.

83
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:29,268
Austin-Healey.

84
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:30,269
Cadillac coupe.

85
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:31,270
Buck.

86
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:32,271
You're on.

87
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,295
Blown intake valve.

88
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,602
Cracked distributor cap.

89
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:36,939
Busted muffler.

90
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,139
Are we all victims

91
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:43,615
of some comic cosmic accident,

92
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,847
or is there a grand design?

93
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:49,184
Oh, what luck.

94
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:54,181
T.C. Roadster.

95
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,455
That's a T.F.

96
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:59,361
A couple of college swells.

97
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,162
You handle them, Ed.

98
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,567
Hi, what seems
to be the problem?

99
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,572
Um, uh...

100
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,168
Do you have anyone here

101
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:12,677
who knows how to deal
with British automobiles?

102
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:13,701
I really don't want anyone

103
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:16,408
just poking around in there
with a sharp stick.

104
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,949
Would it be all right
if I looked under the bonnet?

105
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:23,784
Well, at least
he called it a bonnet.

106
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,290
Ah...

107
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,522
so, that's the engine, huh?

108
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,461
Um, look, I think,
perhaps we ought

109
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,054
to go somewhere else, do you?

110
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:37,202
Intake valve, I'm tellin' ya.

111
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:38,203
Busted muffler.

112
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:39,636
- Intake valve.
- Busted muffler.

113
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:40,730
That's your problem
right there.

114
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:41,740
What?

115
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:42,741
You got no spark.

116
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:43,742
What?

117
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:44,970
You have no spark.

118
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,638
Yes, I heard him, Catherine.

119
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,169
What do you think
it means?

120
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:49,408
Is it the generator?

121
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,416
The coil? What?

122
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,712
Well, it's hard to say.

123
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:54,151
You see, you have a Lucas
type four generator

124
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,985
on a 12-volt system,
and you know the British.

125
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,389
They'd rather spend time
gluing wood on a dashboard

126
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:03,156
than getting
the electrical system right.

127
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,324
Fascinating, but what is wrong
with the car?

128
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:11,068
Well, my guess is
your stroke is too short

129
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,698
and you're getting
premature ignition.

130
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,072
Does it ever feel that way?

131
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,337
Like what?

132
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,106
Like the stroke is too short

133
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:22,137
and you're getting
premature ignition?

134
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:25,344
Well, I'm sure I don't
know what you mean.

135
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,943
Could you just fix it

136
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:28,920
at least temporarily,
do you think?

137
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:31,355
We're really running
behind schedule here.

138
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,518
I'll check with my boss.

139
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,049
Don't go away.

140
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,564
He seems nice enough.

141
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,899
He, he's a troglodyte.

142
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:44,903
Intake valve, right?

143
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:45,904
Busted muffler?

144
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:46,905
I'm going to marry her.

145
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:47,906
Who? The dame?

146
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,929
Yeah.

147
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:49,964
Wow, that was fast.

148
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:50,974
What about the car?

149
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:52,408
Cracked distributor cap.

150
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:53,878
You wouldn't believe it.

151
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,778
I looked at her,
she looked at me

152
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:57,248
and it was...
it happened.

153
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:58,307
You could feel it.

154
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,342
It was like death,
but in a good way.

155
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:01,353
He's going screwy.

156
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:03,048
Pop, pop, pop, pop.

157
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,113
It was electric.

158
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,751
And then, then I kissed her.

159
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,693
You kissed a customer?

160
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:09,695
When?

161
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:10,696
In the future.

162
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,924
It was weird.

163
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,898
It was like time and space
got all mixed up and...

164
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,765
it was like
a Martian mind-meld.

165
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:17,770
He's cracking up.

166
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,294
All right, look, I want you to
stay away from the magazines.

167
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:20,305
That's an order.

168
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:21,636
No, you don't understand.

169
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:22,698
It was, it was, okay...

170
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,642
the past, the present,
and the future

171
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:25,644
they all went together.

172
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:27,441
I had kids with her.
I could see the kids.

173
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,175
I had two boys
and three... no.

174
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:30,477
Three boys, two boys...

175
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:31,642
Excuse me?

176
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:33,777
How long will all this take?

177
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,818
Well, that's up to you.

178
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:40,951
It is?

179
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,858
The car, you nut.

180
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,057
Um, I, uh...

181
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:48,794
the car, a few days.

182
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,234
That long?

183
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm going to have to give it
my full attention.

184
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,544
Well, in that case,
I better call a phone.

185
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,481
Do you mind if I use your cab?

186
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,677
There's a cab in the office.

187
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:12,718
Ja, but the uncertainty
principle postulates

188
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:14,726
a universe of chaos

189
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,594
where everything happens
merely by chance.

190
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,632
Oh, thank you.

191
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:27,638
What's going on?

192
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:28,662
We'll take care of it.

193
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,342
Hello? I need a taxi.

194
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,075
Uh, Catherine Boyd.

195
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:37,605
B-O-Y-D.

196
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,242
What? Oh.

197
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,378
What's the address here?

198
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,650
130 Broad.

199
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:44,951
130 Broad.

200
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:48,222
The first stop
is the Silas Paine Institute

201
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:51,253
then I'm going on
to 112 Mercer.

202
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,730
Is that your address?

203
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:53,732
112 Mercer.

204
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,199
Two minutes! Thank you.

205
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:56,394
Bye.

206
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,040
Oh, huh!

207
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:03,302
Well...

208
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:04,741
it was Belgium.

209
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,108
It was?

210
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,112
What was?

211
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:08,204
Mm-hmm. The study.

212
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:09,271
Thank you.

213
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,715
You're welcome.

214
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,742
James, the taxi will be here
in two minutes.

215
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,117
Oh, well done, darling.

216
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:16,746
We'll meet him on the corner.

217
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:18,051
Belgium.

218
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,614
Well, thank you.

219
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:20,921
Two days?

220
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,655
We'll call you.

221
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,526
I, for one, will never believe

222
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,624
that God plays dice
with the universe.

223
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,275
We're wasting time.

224
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:43,475
Come on, serve already.

225
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:44,744
That's ridiculous.

226
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:47,651
How can you waste something
that doesn't exist?

227
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,951
What, time doesn't exist?

228
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:51,250
Since when?

229
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,484
I wouldn't know.

230
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,823
If time doesn't exist,
then there is no "when."

231
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,158
You hear, Liebitzrecht?

232
00:09:57,196 --> 00:10:00,495
Another crazy theory.

233
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:03,161
Then tell me
the correct time now, huh?

234
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:04,260
You see?

235
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:06,897
You can't,
because as you're telling me

236
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,373
the future has already
become the past.

237
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,376
Therefore, there is no present.

238
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,344
Therefore, time doesn't exist!

239
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,272
Oops!

240
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:25,783
Now your racket doesn't exist.

241
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,498
Oh.

242
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:34,999
Yes?

243
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:36,626
You're Albert Einstein.

244
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,296
Thank you.

245
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:39,702
Wow.

246
00:10:39,738 --> 00:10:42,798
May I say what a great fan
I am of yours?

247
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:43,809
Thank you.

248
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,401
That thing you wrote

249
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:47,639
about light being bent
by gravitation

250
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,580
and the whole relativity thing?

251
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:51,310
Man, that is... jiving.

252
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:55,013
I'm still trying
to figure it out.

253
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,988
Me, too.

254
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,793
Uh, can I help you,
Mr...?

255
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,351
Walters, Ed Walters.

256
00:11:03,395 --> 00:11:06,660
Hi. Um... actually, I was
looking for a Catherine Boyd.

257
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,564
I must have
the wrong address.

258
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,432
I'm sorry to
bother you, sir.

259
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:13,165
Oh, Catherine's my niece.

260
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:14,297
She's your niece?

261
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,103
She's your niece?

262
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:17,631
I can't have a niece?

263
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:20,440
Well, that would
make you her uncle.

264
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:23,778
It works nicely, doesn't it?

265
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:24,840
Wow!

266
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:27,876
Well, you see, I found this...

267
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,979
watch of hers at my garage,
and, uh...

268
00:11:30,055 --> 00:11:31,147
Oh, thank you.

269
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,420
I'll see that she gets it.

270
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:36,951
Actually, I was hoping
to return it to her personally.

271
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,430
Why?

272
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:42,434
Let's just say...

273
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,926
it would be beneficial
to her future.

274
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:49,429
Perhaps you better come in,
Mr. Walters.

275
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:57,613
Ah, Mr. Walters, may I
present Boris Podolsky

276
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,880
Kurt Godel,
Nathan Liebitzrecht...

277
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,582
three of the greatest minds
of the 20th century

278
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:08,719
and amongst them,
they can't change a light bulb.

279
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:11,228
Edward, is it?

280
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:12,389
Yes.

281
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,831
Edward has come to pay
a call on Catherine.

282
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:15,925
Oh, really.

283
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,128
That's nice.

284
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:19,228
Very nice.

285
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:29,114
I could fix this for you.

286
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:32,174
Oh, very nice.

287
00:12:32,217 --> 00:12:34,515
Very nice.

288
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:37,647
Thank you very much.

289
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,456
Oh, that's my compass.

290
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:45,589
This is what got me started
in my work.

291
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:50,000
So, young man,
do you think time exists?

292
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:51,730
Time?

293
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:57,938
I was just reading about it

294
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:00,468
in Future Science magazine.

295
00:13:00,512 --> 00:13:01,740
Tell us.

296
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,613
There are these twins,
and one takes a journey

297
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,743
in a spacecraft
at the speed of light

298
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:09,117
and the other one
stays on Earth.

299
00:13:09,154 --> 00:13:11,884
Well, the twin
that travels into space

300
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:15,087
comes back years later,
and he's young.

301
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,459
And the one
who stayed on Earth,

302
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,361
by this time, is very old.

303
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:23,232
So, so, which one
do you think is happier?

304
00:13:23,268 --> 00:13:24,929
The young one.

305
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,631
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

306
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:29,505
No. The one that stayed behind.

307
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,530
Why?

308
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,510
Because he's had a full life

309
00:13:32,544 --> 00:13:35,775
and he's had experiences
and love and pain

310
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,873
and he has a family and friends.

311
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:40,783
And the one who left,

312
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:43,310
well, time has just passed.

313
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,617
Yeah.

314
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:47,318
This is good, no?

315
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:52,495
Tell us, what is
your field of expertise?

316
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:53,998
My job?

317
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,194
I'm a...
I'm an auto mechanic.

318
00:13:56,235 --> 00:14:00,433
See the U.S.A.
In your Chevrolet, ja?

319
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:04,704
Edward, what do you know
about gravity?

320
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:05,937
Gravity?

321
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:06,943
Yeah.

322
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,276
We have a little
gravity problem.

323
00:14:09,314 --> 00:14:11,339
Please be careful, Edward.

324
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:12,873
Take it easy.

325
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:15,113
So, what do you think
of our Catherine, Mr. Walters?

326
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,553
I think she's wonderful.

327
00:14:16,588 --> 00:14:19,079
Wonderful to the power
of three.

328
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:20,421
What power of three?

329
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:21,949
To the power of ten!

330
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,086
We all love her.

331
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:24,755
She's engaged, you know.

332
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,287
Yeah, I know.

333
00:14:26,331 --> 00:14:27,525
I saw the ring.

334
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:31,058
He's a professor
of experimental psychology,

335
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:32,263
James, uh...

336
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,101
- Morland.
- The rat man.

337
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,538
You know what he does?

338
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:40,136
He puts electrodes
on the genitals of the rats.

339
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,943
Some day, I do that to him.

340
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:50,121
Ah, we threw the racket up
to get the birdie.

341
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:55,921
We threw Godel's cane up there
to get the racket.

342
00:14:55,961 --> 00:15:02,560
I threw Podolsky's golf club
up there to get even with him.

343
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:06,332
We're going to throw Godel
up there next.

344
00:15:06,371 --> 00:15:08,430
Yeah.

345
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:10,442
It's a vicious tree.

346
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:11,738
Edward,

347
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:13,802
Edward, what makes you think

348
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:19,250
that she would be better off
with you?

349
00:15:19,284 --> 00:15:21,912
I don't know. Just a feeling.

350
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,421
A feeling?

351
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:25,013
What kind of feeling?

352
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,855
This is going to sound crazy.

353
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:30,122
That's all right.

354
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:31,356
You can tell us.

355
00:15:31,396 --> 00:15:33,956
We are all a little crazy here.

356
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:37,457
Well, when she came
in the garage...

357
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:42,531
it was like everything
slowed down, and got

358
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:45,202
very clear.

359
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,508
It's like when you're
milling a camshaft

360
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,571
or grinding down the curve
on a fender.

361
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,980
A-A-And as you're doing it,

362
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,950
you just know everything is
going to work out perfect.

363
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:56,580
Everything's
going to fit.

364
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,021
You know?

365
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,422
You ever have that feeling?

366
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,428
Yeah, one time in 1905.

367
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,626
Watch out.
Watch out now!

368
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:11,336
Mr. Walters,
are you all right?

369
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:17,939
That gravity...
it's a killer.

370
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:23,175
Mr. Bamberger, I don't know
what it is you think I can do.

371
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:24,614
I'm finishing my thesis.

372
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,244
I do some administrative work
for my Uncle Albert...

373
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,810
but he adores you.
They all do.

374
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:29,946
They'll listen to you.

375
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,114
No, no, no, sit here.

376
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,248
Get the full effect.

377
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,588
Please.

378
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,560
Catherine, I know I funded
the Institute for Advanced Study

379
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:38,119
as a place for pure thought...

380
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,961
but... but...
the symposium next week...

381
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:43,227
it's our last chance.

382
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:45,395
My accountants are all over me.

383
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,901
Sit a little closer.

384
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:53,143
Tell your uncle
we need something...

385
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,839
a new invention
for New Jersey...

386
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,780
something that can be...
bought here

387
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,442
something that
can be made here

388
00:16:58,483 --> 00:17:00,678
something that can be
launched from here.

389
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:03,654
It's important
for the institute.

390
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:07,147
Stereo hi-fidelity.

391
00:17:11,763 --> 00:17:13,754
Spike Jones!

392
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,059
Move a little closer.

393
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,629
It sounds like
he's right here

394
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,765
like you could reach out
and touch him.

395
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,776
Or slap him.

396
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:24,910
You were attracted
to the earth

397
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,140
You were attracted
to the earth

398
00:17:27,178 --> 00:17:30,909
at 32 feet per second
per second.

399
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:32,849
I believe it.

400
00:17:34,352 --> 00:17:37,981
Ah, such a beautiful day.

401
00:17:39,991 --> 00:17:43,256
Come, we'll find Catherine

402
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,388
and you'll give her the watch.

403
00:17:47,165 --> 00:17:49,998
Look at this.

404
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:52,128
You know...

405
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,866
when I was a patent
clerk in Switzerland

406
00:17:54,906 --> 00:17:57,966
I used to wonder what the
universe would look like

407
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:01,206
if I was traveling at
the speed of light...

408
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,374
on a motorcycle.

409
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,081
Hello, professor Einstein!

410
00:18:10,121 --> 00:18:11,679
How you doing, doc?

411
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:13,156
Good. Very good.

412
00:18:13,191 --> 00:18:16,251
I always wanted a convertible.

413
00:18:20,665 --> 00:18:22,656
Wahoo!

414
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:44,310
What?

415
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:45,118
Faster.

416
00:18:45,156 --> 00:18:46,418
Faster.

417
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,255
Okay, hang on, doc.

418
00:19:09,347 --> 00:19:11,781
Wahoo!

419
00:19:18,523 --> 00:19:20,923
Please...

420
00:19:20,992 --> 00:19:23,222
Help... help!

421
00:19:23,261 --> 00:19:24,353
James...

422
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:25,363
Ah, professor.

423
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:26,796
I was looking for Catherine.

424
00:19:26,831 --> 00:19:27,923
Is she here?

425
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:29,763
No. No, but I'm glad
you've come anyway.

426
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:30,768
Dr. Morland!

427
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:32,429
I'm not going to do
your test anymore!

428
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,869
Shouldn't somebody
help this guy?

429
00:19:33,905 --> 00:19:34,735
Oh, he's all right.

430
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,240
It's a time deprivation
experiment.

431
00:19:36,274 --> 00:19:38,834
Go on. Have a look.

432
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:43,508
This is right out
of Martians Ate My Brain.

433
00:19:43,548 --> 00:19:45,516
Have you ever read
that story?

434
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,915
Don't I know you?

435
00:19:46,951 --> 00:19:48,418
This is my friend Edward.

436
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:50,580
We're working
on something together.

437
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,817
Really? What?

438
00:19:52,857 --> 00:19:55,291
Attraction at a distance.

439
00:19:55,326 --> 00:19:58,352
Well... shall we, uh...
go and have a look at the, uh...

440
00:19:58,396 --> 00:20:01,593
and, uh, please, don't touch
anything, will you?

441
00:20:02,967 --> 00:20:07,370
Let me show you the mouse
I was talking about.

442
00:20:07,405 --> 00:20:08,804
He's just around here.

443
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:13,805
Now, the mouse has learned
that the red lever will give him

444
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:15,710
an electrical stimulus
in the brain

445
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,772
that's something akin
to sexual climax

446
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:20,649
and the blue lever
will dispense him food.

447
00:20:20,685 --> 00:20:24,553
Now, this one here
hasn't eaten for three days.

448
00:20:26,257 --> 00:20:27,224
There.

449
00:20:27,258 --> 00:20:29,089
Now, why would he do that?

450
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:36,634
Uh... excuse me
a moment, will you?

451
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:39,296
Gretchen, would you, um...

452
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:43,430
that's curious.

453
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:47,104
That fellow in the booth
calmed down so quickly.

454
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:49,010
Yes. Funny, huh?

455
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:50,240
Where's your watch?

456
00:20:50,281 --> 00:20:51,248
Huh?

457
00:20:51,282 --> 00:20:53,182
You were wearing
a wristwatch.

458
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:56,016
Well, I figured
since time doesn't exist...

459
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,318
who needs a watch?

460
00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:22,844
That was ausgezeichnet.

461
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:24,075
Thank you very much.

462
00:21:24,115 --> 00:21:25,343
You're very welcome.

463
00:21:25,383 --> 00:21:28,784
Next time I bring
my goggles, ja?

464
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,344
All right, doc.

465
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:38,322
Ah, Catherine...

466
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:48,964
Hi.

467
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,171
The garage.

468
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:55,372
He's quite a guy, your uncle.

469
00:21:55,413 --> 00:21:56,573
Yes, he... he...

470
00:21:56,614 --> 00:21:57,740
Do you know him?

471
00:21:57,782 --> 00:22:00,250
I get around.

472
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:02,515
Did you take him
on that thing?

473
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:03,543
Uh-huh.

474
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:06,716
You took Albert Einstein
for a ride on a motorcycle?

475
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:07,747
Uh-huh.

476
00:22:07,792 --> 00:22:09,726
- Well, don't ever do that again.
- Why not?

477
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:11,524
Because he could've
been killed.

478
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:12,587
He loved it.

479
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,824
He went "wahoo."

480
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:14,923
Wahoo?

481
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:17,560
When was the last time
he went "wahoo"?

482
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,536
Well, I'm sure
I don't know.

483
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:21,562
When was the last time
you went "wahoo"?

484
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:24,439
Well, I'm sure I don't know.

485
00:22:24,475 --> 00:22:26,773
Want a... want a lift?

486
00:22:26,811 --> 00:22:29,109
On that?

487
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:30,705
No.

488
00:22:30,748 --> 00:22:31,976
No.

489
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:33,414
No.

490
00:22:33,451 --> 00:22:36,511
Come on, what could happen?

491
00:22:36,554 --> 00:22:37,953
So you die a little.

492
00:22:43,928 --> 00:22:45,452
Hey, help me out,
will you?

493
00:22:45,496 --> 00:22:46,724
I'm a little nervous.

494
00:22:46,764 --> 00:22:47,788
Oh, really? Why?

495
00:22:47,832 --> 00:22:49,857
I'm trying to figure
out the best way

496
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:51,095
to ask you to dinner.

497
00:22:51,135 --> 00:22:53,535
Uh... mister...

498
00:22:53,571 --> 00:22:55,436
Walters. Ed.

499
00:22:55,473 --> 00:22:56,462
Right.

500
00:22:56,507 --> 00:22:58,304
I'm sure you're
a very nice person

501
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:01,210
and I'm happy to know
that my future automotive safety

502
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:03,214
is in your large,
very capable hands

503
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:05,682
but l-I really should
be going that way

504
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,049
so... good-bye.

505
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:12,079
Well, then dinner's
out of the question.

506
00:23:12,123 --> 00:23:13,090
Yeah.

507
00:23:13,124 --> 00:23:14,955
So I should give you this.

508
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:17,320
You found it.

509
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:18,454
You left it.

510
00:23:18,496 --> 00:23:19,463
You fixed it.

511
00:23:19,497 --> 00:23:20,464
I polished it.

512
00:23:20,498 --> 00:23:21,522
Thank you.

513
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,558
And I tightened the screws.

514
00:23:24,602 --> 00:23:26,433
I can feel that.

515
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:28,462
It's very pretty.

516
00:23:29,774 --> 00:23:31,435
It was my father's.

517
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:33,967
I thought I'd lost it.

518
00:23:34,078 --> 00:23:35,272
Thank you.

519
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:36,712
You're welcome.

520
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:41,379
Um... I'm sorry
if I was abrupt before.

521
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:43,444
No problem.

522
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:46,715
What?

523
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:47,986
Astonishing.

524
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,823
An unmistakable
chemical reaction.

525
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:52,352
What?

526
00:23:54,365 --> 00:23:56,458
What?

527
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:58,492
Marlon Brando.

528
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:06,510
Maybe not.

529
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:10,607
So, James?

530
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:11,673
Yes?

531
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:13,378
Where is it to be?

532
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:14,942
Where is what to be,
Duncan?

533
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,954
The honeymoon, man,
the honeymoon.

534
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:19,287
What have you two
lovebirds decided on?

535
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:21,952
Uh, well, we haven't really
discussed it much.

536
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:24,621
Um, though I was thinking
the lturi forest

537
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:26,290
in the Belgian Congo.

538
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:27,923
The lturi forest.
Excellent.

539
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:31,129
There's a pygmy village
near the Embouti settlement.

540
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,933
You know it,
don't you, Duncan?

541
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,302
Yes, it's fascinating.

542
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:36,637
Sort of a complete pygmy package
if you'd like.

543
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:39,269
There's hospitality heart,
wild boar roast

544
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,643
you wash in the river,
tribal rituals...

545
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,079
that sort of a thing.

546
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:45,675
It's like being one
of the tribe, really.

547
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:47,947
It's the opportunity
of a lifetime.

548
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,317
I like it.

549
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:51,788
I was thinking
more along the lines

550
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,984
of a million kisses
on your skin.

551
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:55,787
I beg your pardon, chimpmunk?

552
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,591
On Maui they have
these natural slides

553
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,963
formed from these volcanic
eruptions of obsidian

554
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,592
and you go climbing up

555
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:06,103
and then you go sliding
down a hundred feet

556
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:08,629
into what they call
the Seven Sacred Pools.

557
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:10,938
And the water is so aerated

558
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:14,173
that it feels like
a million kisses on your skin

559
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:18,081
or like an enormous tongue
just licking your entire body.

560
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,153
Dean, do you remember

561
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,553
we were talking
about the funding?

562
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:28,287
Obsidian slides
and great licking tongues?

563
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:31,057
My god, he's the head
of the whole department.

564
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:33,787
- James?
- Hmm?

565
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:36,960
How would you like a million
kisses on your skin?

566
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:38,195
What?

567
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:40,637
What if we have our own
primitive ritual

568
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:41,969
right here.

569
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:43,406
Have you gone mad?!

570
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:44,932
What are you doing?!

571
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,248
You don't love me.

572
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:56,186
What, because I won't make love
to you in the middle

573
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,745
of some dinner party?

574
00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:00,189
Catherine, how can you say
such a thing?

575
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,352
You know I love you
more than anything.

576
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,726
You're my little
munchkin, aren't you?

577
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:06,424
I don't know, James.
Am I?

578
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:08,092
But of course you are.

579
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:10,624
My little munchy munchkin.

580
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:12,830
Look, I wasn't going to
tell you this till later

581
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:15,101
but you remember that surprise
I told you about?

582
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,266
No.

583
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:17,605
The cards.
The color cards.

584
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:18,769
Yes.

585
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,937
Well, when we come home
from our honeymoon

586
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:23,277
we're going to have
a home to come home to.

587
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:25,510
In Stanford.

588
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,950
Oh...

589
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:28,951
Full professor

590
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:30,749
Department
of Applied Psychology.

591
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:34,418
And it comes with its own
little munchkin nest.

592
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:36,791
And you already
picked out the color.

593
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:38,227
Algae.

594
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,629
This is a color?

595
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:43,499
And there'll be plenty
of room for the children.

596
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:44,832
Children...

597
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,498
James says that spacing them
three and a half years apart

598
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:49,473
is optimal for their
mental development.

599
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:52,170
But what about your
mental development?

600
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,734
What?

601
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,576
Your research.

602
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,809
I don't know.

603
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,841
Sometimes I wonder
if I wouldn't be a better mother

604
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:02,911
than a mechanic...
mathematician.

605
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,054
Catherine...

606
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:09,925
when your father asked me
to care for you

607
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:14,431
I tried to tell him
that the things I know

608
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:18,425
are not very useful
in the real world.

609
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:22,429
And that's why I'm so lucky
that I have James.

610
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,942
We have common goals
and interests.

611
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:27,773
He's brilliant,
organized, a planner.

612
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:31,180
I find him
very stimulating.

613
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:32,615
Intellectually.

614
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:35,211
Yeah, but what about love,
Catherine?

615
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,714
What?!

616
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:40,782
I said when does this
all happen...

617
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,794
this wonderful, organized life?

618
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:44,056
In September.

619
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:46,064
They say Stanford is beautiful.

620
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:47,565
That's what they say.

621
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:51,262
This is the happiest day
of my entire life.

622
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:02,303
Don't worry, liebchen.

623
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,939
It will work out.

624
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:16,817
I promise.

625
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,930
I'm crazy
about this song.

626
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:30,440
Get him.

627
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,943
What are you, Podolsky,
a hep cat?

628
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:35,104
No. I'm an American.

629
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:37,944
Oh... so what is it,
Mr. Hep cat American?

630
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:39,574
I know. It's a... it's a...

631
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:41,141
Look out!

632
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:47,614
Learn to drive,
for God's sake!

633
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,559
They should make
people pass a test

634
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:51,061
before they let them drive!

635
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:52,893
You had to pass a test.

636
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:54,956
How else could you
get a license?

637
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:57,934
A license?

638
00:28:57,969 --> 00:29:00,130
It's "tutti frutti" or hutti?

639
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:01,468
Quiet!

640
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:05,101
What is wrong
with you today, Albert?

641
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:06,110
Eh!

642
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:07,509
Catherine...

643
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:09,706
she should be having
more fun.

644
00:29:09,747 --> 00:29:12,272
What she needs
is a young man.

645
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:15,309
She should go out,
go dancing...

646
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:17,014
A little schtupping.

647
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:18,147
Come on.

648
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:19,417
Nathan, please.

649
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:22,915
She thinks schtupping
is a town in Bavaria.

650
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,454
Where are you taking us,
Albert?

651
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:31,401
Well, boys, how would you like
to have a convertible?

652
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:34,865
- Excellent!
- Excellent.

653
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,393
Phew!

654
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:58,486
Perfect.

655
00:29:58,530 --> 00:29:59,827
Oh, beautiful.

656
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:03,424
Sir?

657
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:07,895
It's very nice upholstery.

658
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:09,804
You're Albert Einstein.

659
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:12,969
E = mc squared.

660
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:15,944
I hope so.

661
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,448
Tell me, this comes
from the factory like this?

662
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,950
Oh, no, no.
It's all custom.

663
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,077
I can't believe it...
in my garage.

664
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,417
This is a real honor.

665
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:25,615
Frankie, this is
Professor Einstein,

666
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,682
the smartest person
in the world.

667
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:29,716
How they hanging?

668
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:33,430
Edward!

669
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:34,761
Hey, doc.

670
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:35,823
Edward.

671
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,528
There it is.

672
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:38,866
What do you think?

673
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:39,870
Is it possible?

674
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,201
Sure. Anything's possible.

675
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:42,968
He wants to turn
that into this...

676
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:43,974
Convertible.

677
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,305
No problem.

678
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,811
You were talking about the
full treatment, Professor?

679
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:50,143
Ja, ja.
The whole ball of wax.

680
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,813
Podolsky, stop that.

681
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:54,818
Okay, so we chop the top,

682
00:30:54,852 --> 00:30:56,820
do a modified nose and deck...

683
00:30:56,854 --> 00:30:58,151
Fill and block.

684
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,020
French tuck and roll
on the inside.

685
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:01,421
Dago the front?

686
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:02,756
Just a touch.

687
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:04,421
Quad barrels for the mill.

688
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:06,089
A master kit.

689
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,427
Hot coil.

690
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:08,762
Stinger exhaust.

691
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,427
High nickel chrome.

692
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:11,935
Sound good?

693
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,437
Like Mozart.

694
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:15,132
You know, I recall

695
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:17,971
here someplace is
an ice cream parlor.

696
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:19,442
Come, we get a scoop.

697
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:21,069
Doc, actually, it's this way.

698
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:22,409
Is it all right?

699
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:23,744
Yeah, go, go.

700
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:25,078
Thank you very much.

701
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:27,016
- Sure.
- Sure.

702
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:34,491
When I first arrived
here in 1933,

703
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:38,484
I went and bought one
of these triple scoops.

704
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:39,996
What flavor?

705
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:41,726
Peppermint.

706
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:42,858
You see?

707
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,492
This is a good question.

708
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:46,002
"What flavor?"

709
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:49,996
Simple, specific,
and it has an answer.

710
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,474
You read a lot
of science fiction.

711
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:57,379
Tell me, do you think they'll
ever find intelligent life

712
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,713
anywhere in the universe?

713
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,981
They're still looking
for intelligent life

714
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,317
here on Earth.

715
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:10,318
You know, Catherine...
she's a brilliant mathematician

716
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:12,090
but she lacks confidence.

717
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,928
She thinks her contribution
to the world

718
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:16,729
will be through her children.

719
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,601
She has this crazy idea

720
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:23,368
that if she marries
an intellectual

721
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:26,605
she will have
genius children

722
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:29,135
or something like that.

723
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:32,172
Catherine...
she's too smart for that.

724
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:33,979
Oh, she's too smart here.

725
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:35,417
But not here.

726
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:39,412
What she needs is to go out
with someone like you.

727
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:40,754
The problem is

728
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:44,353
she would never go out
with someone like you.

729
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:45,692
That's easy.

730
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:48,824
Just lend me your brain
for a couple of days.

731
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:52,899
What?

732
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:56,930
Are you thinking
what I am thinking?

733
00:32:56,974 --> 00:32:59,807
What would be the odds
of that happening?

734
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,449
It's still not right.

735
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,452
What?

736
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,181
He doesn't look
like a scientist.

737
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:13,122
So, what's the plan again, doc?

738
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,624
Here, try this.

739
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,492
The plan is we talk science.

740
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:19,155
We have something to eat.

741
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:20,960
We drink some schnapps.

742
00:33:20,998 --> 00:33:22,522
And we talk about life.

743
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,057
I think it's too fashionable.

744
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:25,330
Yeah, yeah.

745
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:28,339
Here... take some.
There's a coat.

746
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:29,533
Wait, wait.

747
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,405
Nathan, your cardigan.

748
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:36,980
What do I do
if she asks me a question?

749
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:38,345
Ah.

750
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:39,816
She asks you a question...

751
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:43,150
here... you pretend
to smoke a pipe.

752
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,711
And then you say,

753
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:46,883
"Interesting concept."

754
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:48,824
Don't worry.

755
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,987
We'll change the subject.

756
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:52,926
Change the subject?

757
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:54,989
You know, like in football.

758
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:57,000
We'll run interference.

759
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:58,535
And now...

760
00:33:58,569 --> 00:33:59,866
this is a tie.

761
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:01,963
Here... this will
hold up your pants.

762
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:02,938
Good, huh?

763
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,029
Yeah.

764
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:06,441
Yeah.

765
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:08,502
He looks like a French
impressionist.

766
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:09,740
Yeah, yeah.

767
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:31,528
...the nuclear configuration

768
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,332
is given by
the expectation value

769
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:36,499
of the nuclear Hamiltonian,
in a state with "M" neutrons...

770
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:41,772
...Will occur if the energy
of the fuse state is lower

771
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:43,041
than the energy of...

772
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:47,315
Our task is to see
if the dynamics dictated

773
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:49,319
by the interaction Hamiltonian

774
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:51,947
generates a sufficiently
rapid reaction

775
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:54,981
to make cold fusion-powered
engines feasible.

776
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:56,220
Hello.

777
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:58,388
Hello.

778
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,623
Hello, liebchen.

779
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:05,764
So, we have here
E over C squared.

780
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:07,930
It's E squared.

781
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:09,906
Minus E squared
over B

782
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,568
minus V of X.

783
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:19,949
Uh, what's going on?

784
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:21,576
It seems our friend Edward here

785
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:24,486
has been holding out
on us.

786
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:28,891
In addition to being
a very fine automotive mechanic

787
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:32,987
he is also in physics
something of a wunderkind.

788
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:35,797
A wunderkind.

789
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:36,959
I, I had this idea.

790
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:39,902
I ran it by the doc
and we worked on it together

791
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:42,371
and everybody thought
it wasn't so bad.

792
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:43,805
So! "It wasn't so bad."

793
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:44,967
It was astonishing.

794
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:46,236
Very innovative.

795
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:48,370
Well, do I get to hear
what it is?

796
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:51,610
I figured out how to build

797
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:54,675
a nuclear-powered
spacecraft engine, I think.

798
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,380
A fusion engine.

799
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,148
A what?!

800
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:58,883
The process
that fuels the stars.

801
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:00,686
We're going to put it
in a bottle.

802
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:03,626
Cold fusion.

803
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,526
It's mind-boggling.

804
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:07,155
He's a mechanic.

805
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:09,598
I was a clerk
in a patent office.

806
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:11,363
Faraday was a carpenter.

807
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:14,303
Isaac Newton was an
insurance salesman.

808
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,066
Fusion.

809
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:18,803
Fusion.

810
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,936
Really?
Well, what are you wearing?

811
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:24,812
What difference does it make
what he is wearing?

812
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:29,980
A nuclear-powered spacecraft.

813
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:34,156
Well, that's perfect
for New Jersey.

814
00:36:34,191 --> 00:36:35,715
New Jersey?

815
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,954
The symposium.

816
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:38,790
I don't suppose you
have a paper on this.

817
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:39,625
Paper?

818
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:42,462
No, no, you see,
there are certain details...

819
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,365
We must check the spelling.

820
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:46,563
We could have it ready.

821
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:47,696
You could?

822
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:48,966
Yeah. Sure.

823
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,405
Couldn't we?

824
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:51,874
Ja, we could.

825
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:55,678
When is the symposium?

826
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,806
April 1.

827
00:36:57,848 --> 00:36:59,145
Five days.

828
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:00,810
That's not a problem.

829
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:02,079
Oh, this is great!

830
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:04,053
Bamberger will be thrilled.

831
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:07,524
I am very grateful.

832
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,493
This is so...
huge, really.

833
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:17,400
Isaac Newton was not
an insurance salesman.

834
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:27,935
W-what?

835
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:32,075
Boys, our little experiment

836
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:35,244
has just jumped
to a higher energy level.

837
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:39,819
Over X...

838
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:41,586
minus Y to the X + Y...

839
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:42,887
Minus Y to the X...

840
00:37:42,926 --> 00:37:44,518
What language is that, Martian?

841
00:37:44,561 --> 00:37:45,550
Wait, wait a minute, wait.

842
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,086
You're not changing anything,
are you?

843
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:48,120
No.

844
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:49,427
Well, what's all that?

845
00:37:49,466 --> 00:37:50,433
Nothing.

846
00:37:50,467 --> 00:37:52,059
All right, grab your scalpel.

847
00:37:52,102 --> 00:37:53,501
Let's operate.

848
00:37:58,275 --> 00:37:59,640
I don't believe it!

849
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:01,338
Einstein's car!

850
00:38:01,378 --> 00:38:02,902
We do this right, Eddie boy,

851
00:38:02,946 --> 00:38:05,278
we're going to have
a whole new clientele!

852
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:06,442
Whoo!

853
00:38:12,222 --> 00:38:14,918
Welcome to the first
international physics symposium

854
00:38:14,958 --> 00:38:18,450
designed to bring together
the very best minds.

855
00:38:18,495 --> 00:38:20,793
It's time, Edward.

856
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:25,632
Now, this is the largest
gathering of the scientific...

857
00:38:25,669 --> 00:38:27,159
I can't do this.

858
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:30,765
Why? Because you're sick
with fear and anxiety?

859
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:31,934
99% Of the world

860
00:38:32,042 --> 00:38:34,533
wakes up like this
every morning.

861
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:35,545
Every morning.

862
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:36,807
Every morning.

863
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:42,683
Edward, just remember
why you are doing this.

864
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,419
Many of the mysteries
that we, until now, only...

865
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,358
She's not even here.

866
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:51,122
It's not as if
he's even ever shown

867
00:38:51,161 --> 00:38:52,822
any signs of normal
intelligence.

868
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:54,421
Think of that...
nuclear fusion.

869
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:55,955
I suppose
these things happen.

870
00:38:55,999 --> 00:38:57,227
Idiot savant... you know,

871
00:38:57,267 --> 00:38:59,064
a mental patient
plays perfect chess

872
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:00,570
a nine-year-old from Alabama

873
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:02,902
suddenly starts speaking
in iambic pentameter.

874
00:39:03,006 --> 00:39:04,837
James, it's packed!

875
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:08,743
To open our program here,
delivering his paper

876
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:13,045
entitled "Cold Fusion-Powered
Exploration Paradigms"

877
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:15,643
is our very own Edward Walters.

878
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:26,058
Edward Walters.

879
00:39:31,101 --> 00:39:32,534
Dr. Walters?

880
00:39:32,569 --> 00:39:34,730
Dr. Walters?

881
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,670
Doctor...?

882
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:56,390
Are you all right,
Dr. Walters?

883
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:58,588
Ed.

884
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:00,256
Ed?

885
00:40:03,867 --> 00:40:05,425
Ed.

886
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:18,613
No, no

887
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:22,881
it's P squared over N,
not N squared over P.

888
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,854
She's not even here.

889
00:40:24,888 --> 00:40:29,985
If she marries a genius,
she'll have genius children.

890
00:40:30,093 --> 00:40:31,754
Do something.

891
00:40:31,795 --> 00:40:35,629
I am doing something,
but it's not helpful.

892
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:37,224
Or pleasant.

893
00:40:37,267 --> 00:40:40,395
A nuclear-powered spacecraft.

894
00:40:40,437 --> 00:40:42,803
Distinguished colleagues...

895
00:40:44,274 --> 00:40:46,003
honored guests...

896
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:48,534
Edward, just remember

897
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:52,379
why you are doing this.

898
00:40:58,922 --> 00:41:02,187
Any journey in life...

899
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:06,925
if not done for human reasons,
with understanding and love...

900
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,761
This is not the paper we wrote.

901
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,426
Shh! Listen.

902
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:13,368
...would be a very empty
and lonely one.

903
00:41:13,403 --> 00:41:14,529
And look.

904
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:19,571
Something worth remembering,

905
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:23,569
since nuclear-powered spacecraft
may soon make the ancient dream

906
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:29,075
of traveling to the edge
of the universe and back...

907
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,746
a reality.

908
00:41:30,787 --> 00:41:35,622
The source of that power

909
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:40,096
is the very source
that fuels the stars themselves

910
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,529
and, in doing so

911
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:47,003
fuels our imagination
and our dreams.

912
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:49,197
Let us suppose

913
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:53,005
that V of X
is the standard barrier

914
00:41:53,076 --> 00:41:55,374
of penetration potential

915
00:41:55,412 --> 00:42:01,351
and that size... and nuclear...
function...

916
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:08,120
then, as usual,
minus l-H-R-D sine D-T equals

917
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:11,127
minus D squared

918
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:14,892
psi D-X squared

919
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:16,923
plus V of X.

920
00:42:21,271 --> 00:42:22,568
What a circus!

921
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:25,439
As if the scientific analysis
wasn't mind-numbing enough

922
00:42:25,475 --> 00:42:27,739
what was all that mush
about the human heart?

923
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:30,770
You didn't understand that
because you're not a physicist.

924
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:32,441
Yeah, well,
let's remember, darling,

925
00:42:32,482 --> 00:42:33,915
neither was he until recently.

926
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:35,646
Did you notice he
still had grease

927
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:36,880
under his fingernails?

928
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,182
Edward, congratulations.

929
00:42:38,221 --> 00:42:39,449
To genius.

930
00:42:39,489 --> 00:42:41,320
To fusion.

931
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:42,848
To the heart.

932
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,292
- Ah!
- Ah!

933
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:46,558
Ah, oh, so you never
went to college.

934
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:48,360
I barely finished high school.

935
00:42:48,398 --> 00:42:50,525
I was always taking
apart some car.

936
00:42:50,567 --> 00:42:53,297
And yet, you have
such an amazing grasp of theory.

937
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:56,306
Do you know, I believe that
you used Debrawley's formula

938
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,137
for the length
of the pilot wave.

939
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,199
Of course he did.

940
00:42:59,242 --> 00:43:01,437
It was a brilliant stroke.

941
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:02,945
I couldn't have done without it.

942
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:05,072
Oh! I forgot that.

943
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:06,241
Wait a minute.

944
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:07,944
Could you, could you remind me?

945
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:09,246
Um...

946
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:11,584
Yeah. Um, sure.

947
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:13,249
Uh...

948
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,349
X

949
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:16,484
equals...

950
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:18,756
one

951
00:43:18,795 --> 00:43:20,092
plus, uh...

952
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:22,256
W...

953
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:27,097
X equals one
plus W

954
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:28,104
cubed...

955
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:33,699
in...

956
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:35,268
over pi.

957
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:37,906
Right, right.

958
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,006
Can you invert that?

959
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:42,181
Where is he?!

960
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:44,084
Where is that beautiful boy?

961
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,281
Rocket ships.

962
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:47,313
- Zoom!
- Zoom!

963
00:43:47,357 --> 00:43:49,518
Home run, Catherine, home run!

964
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:50,719
Thank you, sir.

965
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:53,252
Ed Walters, may I present
Louis Bamberger?

966
00:43:53,296 --> 00:43:56,732
If you had a nickel
for every nickel he has,

967
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:59,361
you would have
a lot of nickels.

968
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:02,861
An honor and a pleasure, sir.

969
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:04,430
New Jersey...

970
00:44:04,474 --> 00:44:06,908
leader in intergalactic
rocket exploration.

971
00:44:06,943 --> 00:44:09,207
How does that sound
for a license plate?

972
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:10,645
Long.

973
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:11,943
Huh? Oh...

974
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,244
sense of humor.

975
00:44:13,283 --> 00:44:14,910
I love this boy.

976
00:44:14,951 --> 00:44:18,148
May I steal my niece
for one minute, please?

977
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:20,247
Uh, well, actually,
we were just about to leave.

978
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,417
Just for one moment, please.

979
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:23,721
I need some air.

980
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,729
James, how is
the rat business?

981
00:44:26,763 --> 00:44:28,424
Um, well, it's
really students

982
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:30,262
that I'm experimenting on now.

983
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,598
My god, the mazes
must be enormous.

984
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:37,440
Green, black, red.

985
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:38,702
Look at that.

986
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:40,471
It's like having
four pens in one.

987
00:44:41,611 --> 00:44:43,806
What an exciting time
to be alive.

988
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:46,077
Louis, we need
to have a talk.

989
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:48,380
This is going to be something
I understand, isn't it?

990
00:44:48,418 --> 00:44:49,282
Yeah, yeah.

991
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:50,946
I don't understand
what you say to me.

992
00:44:50,987 --> 00:44:52,750
Yes, but you see...

993
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:58,094
Oh, that's better.

994
00:44:58,128 --> 00:45:00,153
Look, Catherine.

995
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:04,190
Look at the stars,
look at the sky,

996
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:05,292
look at...

997
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:06,927
Edward.

998
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:10,495
We were just talking
about the stars.

999
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:12,667
Ah... well,
enough breathing.

1000
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:14,199
Wow.

1001
00:45:16,179 --> 00:45:17,612
What a night.

1002
00:45:17,647 --> 00:45:20,115
I haven't seen a sky like
this since I was a kid.

1003
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,448
That's stargazers' field.

1004
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:24,784
How many stars
do you think are up there?

1005
00:45:24,821 --> 00:45:25,788
Hmm.

1006
00:45:25,822 --> 00:45:28,450
Um, ten to the
twelfth, plus one.

1007
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:30,619
Ah, you don't have
to say that.

1008
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,992
No, really, everybody
is quite impressed.

1009
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:39,298
Do you know why
a comet's tail

1010
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:41,133
always points away
from the sun?

1011
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:42,331
Yes.

1012
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,137
Me, too.

1013
00:45:46,676 --> 00:45:48,644
My grandma used
to tell me that

1014
00:45:48,678 --> 00:45:52,341
stars are where a woodpecker
pecked holes in the sky.

1015
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:54,976
She wasn't that
scientifically minded.

1016
00:45:55,051 --> 00:45:56,985
When my father
looked at the sky

1017
00:45:57,053 --> 00:45:58,987
he didn't really see stars.

1018
00:45:59,055 --> 00:46:00,818
He said he saw

1019
00:46:00,857 --> 00:46:04,816
great seas of fire
and nuclear furnaces.

1020
00:46:04,861 --> 00:46:07,659
He said it was like
a very violent ballet

1021
00:46:07,697 --> 00:46:10,359
only it was too small
for anyone to see.

1022
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:16,437
What is keeping James?

1023
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:17,940
I don't know.

1024
00:46:17,974 --> 00:46:20,272
He discovered a comet.

1025
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:21,607
James discovered a...?

1026
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:22,942
No. My father.

1027
00:46:22,979 --> 00:46:24,947
They named it after him.

1028
00:46:24,981 --> 00:46:26,278
Boyd's comet.

1029
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:27,283
Mm-hmm.

1030
00:46:27,317 --> 00:46:28,614
Oh, my god, that's you.

1031
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:29,949
That's your father.

1032
00:46:29,986 --> 00:46:31,283
Mm-hmm.

1033
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:33,448
L-I was just reading
about that in the...

1034
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:35,287
Oh, you've read his works?

1035
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:36,622
Well, some of them.

1036
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:37,786
There are so many.

1037
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:39,125
Three.

1038
00:46:39,162 --> 00:46:40,789
Three? Really?

1039
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:42,799
There...
it seemed like more.

1040
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:44,824
They're all
so action-packed.

1041
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:51,406
Action-packed?

1042
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:53,170
What is he saying?

1043
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:56,308
He's coming back.

1044
00:46:56,346 --> 00:46:57,313
James?

1045
00:46:57,347 --> 00:46:59,645
No. Uh, my father.

1046
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:01,480
You know, just before he died

1047
00:47:01,518 --> 00:47:03,816
he promised
that when the comet came back

1048
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:05,481
he'd be riding on it.

1049
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:07,319
Right, uh...

1050
00:47:07,357 --> 00:47:09,917
right there.

1051
00:47:10,026 --> 00:47:13,518
I think it's there,
just below Cassiopeia.

1052
00:47:15,131 --> 00:47:16,621
Ah, you're right.

1053
00:47:17,968 --> 00:47:20,596
He said he'd be riding on it

1054
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:23,265
looking down
to make sure I was okay.

1055
00:47:23,306 --> 00:47:24,603
So, how are you?

1056
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:25,938
Are you okay?

1057
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:27,773
Catherine?

1058
00:47:27,811 --> 00:47:30,109
Catherine!

1059
00:47:30,146 --> 00:47:31,943
The rat man cometh.

1060
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:32,949
I...

1061
00:47:33,049 --> 00:47:34,744
Catherine?

1062
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:37,780
Somebody call a doctor.

1063
00:47:37,821 --> 00:47:39,516
Albert, say something.

1064
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:43,458
I just had too many knerdlers
for lunch.

1065
00:47:43,493 --> 00:47:45,120
I need my pills.

1066
00:47:45,161 --> 00:47:47,129
Catherine, you know
where they are?

1067
00:47:47,163 --> 00:47:48,460
At home.

1068
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:49,988
Edward, you drive me.

1069
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:53,628
Yes, all right,
you-you drive him home.

1070
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:55,638
I'll collect your
things, Catherine,

1071
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:58,106
and I'll see you at
the Cafe Day Cup later.

1072
00:47:58,141 --> 00:47:59,108
Yes. Yes.

1073
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:01,269
Yes?

1074
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:04,803
Albert, you want us
to come with you?

1075
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:06,145
No, no.

1076
00:48:06,182 --> 00:48:07,479
Watch out.

1077
00:48:07,517 --> 00:48:09,246
Good-bye, please.

1078
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:11,151
Let's go.
Let's go.

1079
00:48:15,625 --> 00:48:16,592
Wait a minute.

1080
00:48:16,626 --> 00:48:18,924
How do we get home?

1081
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:20,429
Good question.

1082
00:48:20,463 --> 00:48:21,760
Oh...

1083
00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:23,925
it's a lovely night.

1084
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:25,594
We walk.

1085
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:40,113
Oh, look, I found my pills.

1086
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:45,782
Now... maybe we can catch
some of this in a glass.

1087
00:48:45,822 --> 00:48:47,790
Should get you out of this.

1088
00:48:47,824 --> 00:48:49,951
Yeah, that's a good idea.

1089
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:51,517
Over there.

1090
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:53,825
That cafe, Edward.

1091
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:07,907
It's a very bad
Albert Einstein joke.

1092
00:49:07,978 --> 00:49:09,775
Maleva was his first wife.

1093
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:11,110
She divorced him.

1094
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:13,776
Yeah, I lived too much here
and not enough here.

1095
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:14,909
She have children?

1096
00:49:14,951 --> 00:49:15,918
Two boys.

1097
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:17,214
Hans Albert.

1098
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:20,883
His mother named him
while I was out of town.

1099
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:22,391
And Edward.

1100
00:49:22,425 --> 00:49:23,892
Yes?

1101
00:49:23,927 --> 00:49:26,794
No. Edward was the name
of the other boy.

1102
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:29,890
Oh.

1103
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:33,391
Well, you must have lived
here at least twice.

1104
00:49:33,436 --> 00:49:35,461
Edward...

1105
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:40,169
how did you first think
of atomic fuel?

1106
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:43,543
Well, it just sort of hit me.

1107
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:44,547
Boom.

1108
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:45,605
- Boom.
- Boom.

1109
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:49,551
Was it a Kessler boom
or an accident?

1110
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:52,419
Because Kessler believes
that accidental discoveries

1111
00:49:52,455 --> 00:49:53,820
are not accidents at all.

1112
00:49:53,857 --> 00:49:56,826
That people have moments
of insight and intuition

1113
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:59,294
that they're prepared for
by their experience

1114
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,490
to recognize them
for what they are.

1115
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:04,466
Babbling.

1116
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:06,059
Babbling?

1117
00:50:06,102 --> 00:50:08,468
No, you're not babbling.

1118
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:12,908
If I had a mind like yours,
I wouldn't stop talking.

1119
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,771
I think it's letting up.

1120
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:28,557
I think she wants to leave.

1121
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:31,493
She doesn't know what she wants.

1122
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:47,705
Still raining.

1123
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:49,769
Still raining.

1124
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:32,551
I think your uncle wants us...
to dance.

1125
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,523
Oh, now,

1126
00:51:34,557 --> 00:51:36,149
don't be irrelevant, Ed.

1127
00:51:36,192 --> 00:51:38,319
You can't get
from there to here.

1128
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:39,658
Why not?

1129
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:40,993
Now, don't tell me

1130
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:43,659
that a famous
and brilliant scientist

1131
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,099
such as yourself

1132
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:47,160
doesn't know
about Zeno's paradox.

1133
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,103
Remind me.

1134
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,801
You can't get
from there to here

1135
00:51:51,841 --> 00:51:54,605
because you always have to cover
half the remaining distance.

1136
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:57,875
Like, from me to you,
I have to cover half of it.

1137
00:51:57,914 --> 00:51:59,211
But, see?

1138
00:51:59,249 --> 00:52:01,513
I still have half
of that remaining, so...

1139
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:03,883
I cover half that
and, um... there's still

1140
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:04,944
half of that left

1141
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:07,046
so I cover half of that

1142
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:10,287
and, uh... half of that

1143
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:13,296
and half of that
and half of that.

1144
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:16,094
And since there are
infinite halves left...

1145
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:20,229
can't ever get there.

1146
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:34,707
So how did that happen?

1147
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,551
I don't know.

1148
00:52:40,056 --> 00:52:41,990
It's not possible.

1149
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:05,548
James.

1150
00:53:05,582 --> 00:53:06,708
No. Ed.

1151
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:09,378
James. I was supposed
to meet him.

1152
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:11,410
Oh, oh.

1153
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:21,362
Go, go, go,
go, go, go, go.

1154
00:53:22,932 --> 00:53:24,923
Shall we go again?

1155
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:33,335
So we have particle
"C"...Catherine...

1156
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:37,676
in orbit around
particle "J"...James...

1157
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:41,673
powerize particle
"E"...Edward...

1158
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:46,087
follows "C",
becomes a new entity.

1159
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:48,716
"C" plus "E"

1160
00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:51,727
which causes "J"
to disintegrate.

1161
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:57,192
If I could take you up
in paradise above

1162
00:53:57,233 --> 00:54:00,361
If you would tell me
I'm the only one that you love

1163
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:02,701
Life could be a dream,
sweetheart.

1164

00:54:12,915 --> 00:54:14,212
"with the announcement

1168
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:17,276
"of a formula that makes
interplanetary travel

1169
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:20,551
by nu-cu-lear rocket
a real possibility."

1170
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,558
Nuclear.

1171
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:24,560
I said nu-cu-lear,
professor.

1172
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:25,561
Nuclear.

1173
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:26,721
Good picture.

1174
00:54:26,762 --> 00:54:28,730
This has got to be
the dumbest thing

1175
00:54:28,764 --> 00:54:30,891
anybody ever did
to impress a dame.

1176
00:54:30,933 --> 00:54:33,401
Especially one that expects you
to talk to her... she's smart.

1177
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:34,562
Shut up, Frankie.

1178
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:36,731
Eddie, you hardly finished
high school.

1179
00:54:36,772 --> 00:54:39,104
How do you expect
to get away with this?

1180
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:43,078
I know a lot about science.

1181
00:54:43,112 --> 00:54:44,545
Excuse me.

1182
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:45,569
Ed Walters?

1183
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:47,082
Who the hell are you?

1184
00:54:47,116 --> 00:54:48,447
Bill Reilly, Times.

1185
00:54:48,484 --> 00:54:49,451
Yeah?

1186
00:54:49,485 --> 00:54:50,452
Hey, hi.

1187
00:54:50,486 --> 00:54:51,714
Bob Rosetti.

1188
00:54:51,754 --> 00:54:52,743
I own the place.

1189
00:54:52,788 --> 00:54:54,085
Oh, hey, Mr. Rosetti.

1190
00:54:54,123 --> 00:54:56,819
So were you surprised
to find out you had such

1191
00:54:56,859 --> 00:54:58,190
a brilliant employee?

1192
00:54:58,227 --> 00:54:58,989
Surprised?

1193
00:54:59,095 --> 00:55:01,154
Why do you think I hired him?
He's a genius.

1194
00:55:01,197 --> 00:55:03,256
Hey, Ed, a lot of folks
are wondering

1195
00:55:03,299 --> 00:55:05,893
how an ordinary guy like
yourself could come up

1196
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:07,596
with such advanced ideas.

1197
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:08,661
I think I can answer that.

1198
00:55:08,704 --> 00:55:09,932
Hello, Edward.

1199
00:55:10,039 --> 00:55:10,937
Congratulations.

1200
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,337
Thank you.

1201
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:15,105
You see, the fact is
that we're only now

1202
00:55:15,144 --> 00:55:18,375
just beginning to understand
the true nature of intelligence.

1203
00:55:18,414 --> 00:55:19,381
And you are?

1204
00:55:19,415 --> 00:55:20,712
James Morland.

1205
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:21,842
With the, uh...?

1206
00:55:21,884 --> 00:55:23,215
Silas Paine Institute.

1207
00:55:23,252 --> 00:55:25,812
Experimental psychology.

1208
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:29,052
We're learning that, uh,
that thing that we call genius

1209
00:55:29,091 --> 00:55:32,390
that is the ability to make
intuitive breakthroughs

1210
00:55:32,428 --> 00:55:34,293
can flower almost anywhere.

1211
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:37,060
Isn't that so, Edward?

1212
00:55:37,099 --> 00:55:38,623
You're the expert.

1213
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:39,965
Yes. Yes, I am.

1214
00:55:40,002 --> 00:55:41,663
That's really why I'm here.

1215
00:55:41,704 --> 00:55:43,569
Oh, apart from to pick up
my car, of course,

1216
00:55:43,606 --> 00:55:45,403
which I trust is ready by now.

1217
00:55:45,441 --> 00:55:47,341
We'd like to study you.

1218
00:55:47,376 --> 00:55:48,968
Study me?

1219
00:55:49,045 --> 00:55:50,945
Your brain.
Your thinking processes.

1220
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:52,845
It's an extraordinary
opportunity

1221
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:55,407
to increase our understanding
of human knowledge.

1222
00:55:55,451 --> 00:55:56,748
What do you say?

1223
00:55:56,786 --> 00:55:58,083
Can we count on you?

1224
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,917
One, uh, colleague
to another.

1225
00:56:01,557 --> 00:56:04,788
Many of you may recognize
this test.

1226
00:56:04,827 --> 00:56:07,591
It's a variation on the classic
P.C. & D. Examination.

1227
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:09,655
Mr. Walters will have ten
minutes to complete the series.

1228
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:12,259
You will find the first problem
inside this box.

1229
00:56:12,301 --> 00:56:13,268
Are you ready, Ed?

1230
00:56:13,302 --> 00:56:14,929
- Actually...
- Start the clock, please.

1231
00:57:34,583 --> 00:57:36,380
Yes, uh...

1232
00:57:37,953 --> 00:57:39,352
Yes, quite, uh...

1233
00:57:39,388 --> 00:57:41,253
Quite impressive.

1234
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:43,190
Uh, now we move on to phase two.

1235
00:57:43,225 --> 00:57:44,749
Phase two?

1236
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:47,285
Yes, we've, uh, tested
the subject's motor ability.

1237
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:49,560
Now it's time to test
his general knowledge...

1238
00:57:49,598 --> 00:57:51,088
something which,
I must confess

1239
00:57:51,133 --> 00:57:53,567
I've been quite curious about...
and to that end

1240
00:57:53,602 --> 00:57:56,435
I have devised a series
of multiple choice questions...

1241
00:57:56,472 --> 00:57:59,930
50 in all... on relativity,
Newtonian physics

1242
00:57:59,975 --> 00:58:01,067
physical chemistry

1243
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:03,408
and, of course,
some basic quantum mechanics.

1244
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:06,904
The subject has 18 minutes
in which to complete the series.

1245
00:58:06,949 --> 00:58:08,075
Uh, lights, please.

1246
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:09,744
Would you like to sit down?

1247
00:58:09,785 --> 00:58:10,945
And, uh, projector.

1248
00:58:12,021 --> 00:58:14,512
Start the clock.

1249
00:58:20,596 --> 00:58:22,530
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

1250
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:23,827
Excuse me.

1251
00:58:23,866 --> 00:58:25,595
Excuse me.

1252
01:00:40,669 --> 01:00:41,931
Ow!

1253
01:00:45,841 --> 01:00:47,206
I'm done.

1254
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:48,505
That it?

1255
01:00:55,518 --> 01:00:58,817
In an intensive IQ test today,
young auto mechanic Ed Walters

1256
01:00:58,854 --> 01:01:02,915
scored 186, placing him in the
top point-zero-zero-zero...

1257
01:01:02,958 --> 01:01:03,947
Did he pass?

1258
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:04,960
That's our Eddie!

1259
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:06,461
Come on, mention the garage.

1260
01:01:06,495 --> 01:01:07,792
Come on...
Bob and Al's...

1261
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:08,922
Bob and Al's...

1262
01:01:08,964 --> 01:01:10,955
At the White House,
President Eisenhower

1263
01:01:11,033 --> 01:01:14,161
scoffed at the Soviet claims
to have leapt ahead

1264
01:01:14,203 --> 01:01:15,602
in the race to space.

1265
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:17,435
He dismissed the red rumors,

1266
01:01:17,473 --> 01:01:19,668
saying that the first man
in space

1267
01:01:19,708 --> 01:01:22,802
will have hot dogs for lunch...
not borscht.

1268
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:25,973
And the name of the man
who could put us there?

1269
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:26,982
Ed Walters.

1270
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:28,244
I was wrong about him.

1271
01:01:28,284 --> 01:01:30,149
He's not an idiot savant at all.

1272
01:01:30,185 --> 01:01:34,554
He's the real thing...
he's an idiot idiot.

1273
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:35,955
Shh.

1274
01:01:35,991 --> 01:01:37,652
The boy grease-pit genius.

1275
01:01:37,693 --> 01:01:39,991
And like his mentor,
Albert Einstein,

1276
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:41,155
young Ed Walters dreamed

1277
01:01:41,196 --> 01:01:43,130
of solving
the mysteries of the universe.

1278
01:01:43,165 --> 01:01:45,599
If you'd get the stars
out of your eyes

1279
01:01:45,634 --> 01:01:47,101
- you'd see for yourself.
- James!

1280
01:01:47,136 --> 01:01:49,661
Before long,
we'll all be going to the Moon

1281
01:01:49,705 --> 01:01:52,265
for the weekend
on nuclear rocket engines

1282
01:01:52,308 --> 01:01:55,106
and save on our fuel bills
in the bargain.

1283
01:01:55,144 --> 01:01:57,009
Have you actually read

1284
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:59,913
this stupendous,
earth-shattering paper of his?

1285
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:00,916
No.

1286
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:02,315
You didn't?
I'm surprised.

1287
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:04,945
I thought you'd be dying
to get your hands on it.

1288
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,487
You know, as a fellow
mathematician.

1289
01:02:06,522 --> 01:02:08,683
Mathematicians and physicists
everywhere

1290
01:02:08,724 --> 01:02:10,919
are putting this startling
new theory...

1291
01:02:12,494 --> 01:02:13,461
It's me.

1292
01:02:13,495 --> 01:02:15,360
...to examine in detail
the mathematical brilliance

1293
01:02:15,397 --> 01:02:17,194
of this simple garage mechanic

1294
01:02:17,232 --> 01:02:20,258
who believes,
in the land of the free

1295
01:02:20,302 --> 01:02:24,534
and the home of the brave,
nothing is impossible.

1296
01:02:24,573 --> 01:02:26,666
Do the horn again, Edward.

1297
01:02:26,709 --> 01:02:27,869
Ja, ja.

1298
01:02:30,479 --> 01:02:33,209
Albert, we have our convertible.

1299
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:36,979
Good, good.

1300
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:41,386
This is like sailing,
without the wetness.

1301
01:02:41,423 --> 01:02:43,983
Wonderful thing
you have made here, Edward.

1302
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:45,720
Why aren't you smiling?

1303
01:02:45,761 --> 01:02:48,229
I think I've got to tell
Catherine the truth.

1304
01:02:48,263 --> 01:02:49,787
No, no, it's too soon.

1305
01:02:49,832 --> 01:02:52,733
She's falling in love
with the wrong guy, doc.

1306
01:02:52,768 --> 01:02:55,100
Ja, but it's love.

1307
01:02:55,137 --> 01:02:57,435
Edward, it's love.

1308
01:03:10,819 --> 01:03:11,945
Catherine?

1309
01:03:11,987 --> 01:03:13,579
No, thank you.

1310
01:03:13,622 --> 01:03:15,613
Ed.

1311
01:03:15,658 --> 01:03:16,920
Hi.

1312
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:22,829
I was going to ask you
why you use that operator there?

1313
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:27,469
I often ask myself
the same question.

1314
01:03:27,503 --> 01:03:28,470
Oh.

1315
01:03:28,504 --> 01:03:29,471
Yeah.

1316
01:03:29,505 --> 01:03:32,372
It's just a stroke
of brilliance.

1317
01:03:32,408 --> 01:03:35,775
I'm just so close
to figuring it out.

1318
01:03:35,811 --> 01:03:36,778
Trouble ahead.

1319
01:03:36,812 --> 01:03:37,801
Mm-hmm.

1320
01:03:37,846 --> 01:03:39,973
Maybe, maybe not.

1321
01:03:40,082 --> 01:03:42,209
What if she finds
the flaw in our theory?

1322
01:03:42,251 --> 01:03:44,276
Easy. We just undermine
her confidence.

1323
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:45,718
Well, we shouldn't do that.

1324
01:03:45,754 --> 01:03:46,721
How?

1325
01:03:46,755 --> 01:03:49,451
We'll be obscure and obtuse.

1326
01:03:49,491 --> 01:03:52,722
Maybe you're taking something
for granted.

1327
01:03:52,761 --> 01:03:55,423
What if you
question everything?

1328
01:03:55,464 --> 01:04:00,094
Look at it from an entirely
different perspective.

1329
01:04:00,135 --> 01:04:02,296
Question everything.

1330
01:04:09,144 --> 01:04:10,133
Uh-oh.

1331
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:19,913
Uncle Albert...

1332
01:04:19,955 --> 01:04:21,820
could this be right?

1333
01:04:26,495 --> 01:04:27,757
What?

1334
01:04:27,796 --> 01:04:29,627
I know that look. What did I do?

1335
01:04:29,665 --> 01:04:32,964
I never saw it this way.

1336
01:04:33,068 --> 01:04:35,969
Oh.

1337
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:39,234
I don't know what
I was thinking.

1338
01:04:43,846 --> 01:04:45,837
Excuse me.

1339
01:04:51,653 --> 01:04:54,349
What did you say to her?

1340
01:05:02,598 --> 01:05:06,591
Why do you let them
scare you off like that?

1341
01:05:06,635 --> 01:05:08,762
They are the greatest
minds in the world.

1342
01:05:08,804 --> 01:05:10,897
So? Who says they have
all the answers?

1343
01:05:10,939 --> 01:05:12,065
Wait. Who says what?

1344
01:05:12,107 --> 01:05:13,335
Who says you're not one

1345
01:05:13,375 --> 01:05:15,275
of the greatest minds
in the world?

1346
01:05:15,310 --> 01:05:16,641
Well, I'm not like you.

1347
01:05:16,678 --> 01:05:17,667
You're a natural.

1348
01:05:17,713 --> 01:05:19,374
You're just like one of them.

1349
01:05:19,414 --> 01:05:20,847
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

1350
01:05:20,883 --> 01:05:22,282
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

1351
01:05:22,317 --> 01:05:23,375
Believe me, I'm not.

1352
01:05:23,418 --> 01:05:25,511
Oh! Well, okay...
you're younger.

1353
01:05:25,554 --> 01:05:26,748
The point is,

1354
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:29,155
you're not just some
dumb garage mechanic.

1355
01:05:29,191 --> 01:05:30,783
You're a genius,
and I'm just...

1356
01:05:30,826 --> 01:05:31,952
I don't know what I am.

1357
01:05:32,027 --> 01:05:33,324
What? What are you?

1358
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:34,329
A housewife?

1359
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:37,594
Almost.

1360
01:05:37,633 --> 01:05:39,897
I think you're more than that.

1361
01:05:39,935 --> 01:05:44,372
Lady, the only thing
you're afraid of is yourself.

1362
01:05:44,406 --> 01:05:46,374
Wait. Can I just
ask you something?

1363
01:05:46,408 --> 01:05:47,375
What?

1364
01:05:47,409 --> 01:05:48,876
What, um...

1365
01:05:48,911 --> 01:05:50,503
Why do you do that?

1366
01:05:50,546 --> 01:05:51,979
What?

1367
01:05:52,047 --> 01:05:53,514
Brando.

1368
01:05:53,549 --> 01:05:56,541
I'm just trying
to make you smile.

1369
01:05:56,585 --> 01:05:57,552
Oh.

1370
01:05:57,586 --> 01:05:58,553
Well...

1371
01:05:58,587 --> 01:06:00,282
Thanks.

1372
01:06:00,322 --> 01:06:02,085
Bye.

1373
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:07,428
It's for the best.

1374
01:06:07,462 --> 01:06:10,863
We squeeze the brain a little
to make room for the heart.

1375
01:06:10,899 --> 01:06:15,097
But maybe accidents
are part of the grand design?

1376
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:19,733
If you cause the accident
then it is not an accident.

1377
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:20,935
Ah, ja, ja.

1378
01:06:20,976 --> 01:06:23,945
You know, the trouble
with accidents is

1379
01:06:24,012 --> 01:06:26,503
you can't predict the outcome.

1380
01:06:26,548 --> 01:06:28,277
Ah! So-So maybe Catherine

1381
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:30,911
will fall in love
with one of us.

1382
01:06:30,953 --> 01:06:33,922
You are such a dreamer,
lieblich.

1383
01:06:46,735 --> 01:06:48,794
Oh! Oh, I'm sorry.

1384
01:06:48,837 --> 01:06:50,270
Were you sleeping?

1385
01:06:50,305 --> 01:06:51,533
Oh, Catherine, no.

1386
01:06:51,573 --> 01:06:53,507
I was just in repose.

1387
01:06:53,542 --> 01:06:54,509
Oh.

1388
01:06:54,543 --> 01:06:55,874
Where were you?

1389
01:06:55,911 --> 01:06:57,344
Thinking.

1390
01:06:57,379 --> 01:06:59,506
I was worried about you.

1391
01:06:59,548 --> 01:07:01,743
That I was thinking?

1392
01:07:01,783 --> 01:07:02,909
Me, too.

1393
01:07:02,985 --> 01:07:07,149
No, I was worried that
you were angry with me

1394
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:10,590
since it's the one thing
I would not be able to bear.

1395
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:13,117
Please forgive
a foolish old man.

1396
01:07:13,161 --> 01:07:14,321
Oh, no, no, no.

1397
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:15,921
You weren't being...

1398
01:07:15,964 --> 01:07:17,932
Well, maybe a little.

1399
01:07:17,966 --> 01:07:18,933
It was me.

1400
01:07:18,967 --> 01:07:21,458
He'll tell me what to think.

1401
01:07:21,503 --> 01:07:22,527
Who?

1402
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:23,799
My notebook!

1403
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:25,067
I thought I lost this.

1404
01:07:25,107 --> 01:07:26,574
Catherine, who?

1405
01:07:26,608 --> 01:07:31,568
My dad... the comet...
Friday, 10:35.

1406
01:07:31,613 --> 01:07:34,173
Liebchen...

1407
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:37,117
I know we make fun
of your James.

1408
01:07:37,152 --> 01:07:41,054
We call him "the rat man"
and "the rodent king."

1409
01:07:41,089 --> 01:07:43,080
And "the lesser professor"

1410
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:45,616
and "the excremental
psychologist."

1411
01:07:45,661 --> 01:07:48,095
Ja... and "sir monkey lips."

1412
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:49,392
"Chimp pimp."

1413
01:07:49,431 --> 01:07:51,194
This all stops now.

1414
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:52,860
Hmm.

1415
01:07:52,901 --> 01:07:54,630
What I wish for you:

1416
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:57,537
You go out and have
a good life.

1417
01:07:57,572 --> 01:07:58,869
You mean that?

1418
01:08:00,275 --> 01:08:02,436
I just spoke with him.

1419
01:08:02,477 --> 01:08:04,274
Who?

1420
01:08:04,313 --> 01:08:06,247
With the rat... with James.

1421
01:08:06,281 --> 01:08:13,744
Tomorrow, we all go together,
and we have an excursion.

1422
01:08:16,291 --> 01:08:18,088
Hello? Someone lost in...

1423
01:08:18,126 --> 01:08:19,093
Hello.

1424
01:08:19,127 --> 01:08:20,151
We heard screaming.

1425
01:08:20,195 --> 01:08:21,253
- Screaming?
- Ja, ja.

1426
01:08:21,296 --> 01:08:23,287
We are looking for
professor Einstein.

1427
01:08:23,332 --> 01:08:24,924
He said you would
be together.

1428
01:08:25,033 --> 01:08:26,227
Uh, yes, but not here.

1429
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:27,792
I'm going sailing with him.

1430
01:08:29,338 --> 01:08:30,896
Oh, sailing...
of course!

1431
01:08:30,939 --> 01:08:32,634
We were...
we were mistaken.

1432
01:08:32,674 --> 01:08:33,936
We never go sailing.

1433
01:08:33,976 --> 01:08:35,534
Really?

1434
01:08:35,577 --> 01:08:39,138
He says the fish don't want
to eat what we have just eaten.

1435
01:08:40,682 --> 01:08:41,944
I'd better check on this.

1436
01:08:42,017 --> 01:08:43,075
No, no! He's fine.

1437
01:08:43,118 --> 01:08:44,745
Don't touch anything.

1438
01:08:52,794 --> 01:08:54,318
Quiet!

1439
01:08:56,164 --> 01:08:58,598
This is what we miss
in physics: Screaming.

1440
01:08:59,768 --> 01:09:02,566
If anybody screams,
it's usually me.

1441
01:09:02,604 --> 01:09:04,469
Uh, please, don't, don't

1442
01:09:04,506 --> 01:09:05,803
touch anything.

1443
01:09:14,649 --> 01:09:18,278
You let the rats
run around like that, eh?

1444
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:19,753
Very democratic of you.

1445
01:09:19,788 --> 01:09:24,919
18 months
of experimental research gone!

1446
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,258
Oh, the monkeys!

1447
01:09:27,295 --> 01:09:30,423
It's plain to see
you're very busy.

1448
01:09:30,465 --> 01:09:32,592
We come back another time.

1449
01:09:35,704 --> 01:09:37,501
Psychologists... So crazy!

1450
01:09:37,539 --> 01:09:38,597
Go!

1451
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:38,707
Well, I don't understand it.

1452
01:09:38,707 --> 01:09:40,937
Well, I don't understand it.

1453
01:09:41,009 --> 01:09:43,204
He's always ten minutes
early for everything.

1454
01:09:43,244 --> 01:09:45,075
Any longer, we lose the wind.

1455
01:09:45,113 --> 01:09:46,808
Okay, that's it.
We're set.

1456
01:09:46,848 --> 01:09:48,816
I'm very disappointed.

1457
01:09:48,850 --> 01:09:53,583
I was looking forward
to getting to know him better.

1458
01:10:00,829 --> 01:10:03,662
Um...

1459
01:10:03,698 --> 01:10:06,326
well, maybe next time.

1460
01:10:20,582 --> 01:10:21,879
It's pretty.

1461
01:10:21,916 --> 01:10:22,883
Mmm.

1462
01:10:23,918 --> 01:10:24,885
Whoa.

1463
01:10:24,919 --> 01:10:25,908
Sorry.

1464
01:10:25,954 --> 01:10:27,615
It's all right. You okay?

1465
01:10:27,655 --> 01:10:30,249
Uncle Albert...
cut it out!

1466
01:10:30,291 --> 01:10:31,349
Listen, Catherine,

1467
01:10:31,392 --> 01:10:33,417
there's something
I have to tell you.

1468
01:10:33,461 --> 01:10:34,587
No, listen, uh...

1469
01:10:34,629 --> 01:10:36,654
I know that Uncle Albert
and everybody

1470
01:10:36,698 --> 01:10:38,097
wants us to... you know.

1471
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:39,725
But there's
something else...

1472
01:10:39,768 --> 01:10:41,531
No. You have
to let me finish.

1473
01:10:41,569 --> 01:10:43,537
It's just that...

1474
01:10:43,571 --> 01:10:45,698
Well, love between

1475
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:47,002
two people, uh...

1476
01:10:47,041 --> 01:10:48,440
Oh!

1477
01:10:51,379 --> 01:10:52,539
Sorry.

1478
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:54,013
Uncle Albert!

1479
01:10:54,115 --> 01:10:56,447
I'm steering the boat.

1480
01:10:56,484 --> 01:10:58,748
Uh...

1481
01:10:58,787 --> 01:11:00,550
Uh...

1482
01:11:00,588 --> 01:11:01,714
Love...

1483
01:11:01,756 --> 01:11:03,223
No.

1484
01:11:03,258 --> 01:11:06,625
People who share common
goals and interests...

1485
01:11:06,661 --> 01:11:09,357
Did you ever hear
of the color algae?

1486
01:11:09,397 --> 01:11:10,364
No.

1487
01:11:10,398 --> 01:11:11,865
Oh.

1488
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,891
Anyway, the point is, Ed,
that, um...

1489
01:11:13,935 --> 01:11:16,233
you can't choose
who you're gonna love.

1490
01:11:16,271 --> 01:11:17,397
Well, I know that.

1491
01:11:17,438 --> 01:11:19,133
You know? It just happens.

1492
01:11:19,174 --> 01:11:21,301
And I think you're
a decent person

1493
01:11:21,342 --> 01:11:22,639
and I respect you...

1494
01:11:22,677 --> 01:11:23,905
I respect you, too.

1495
01:11:23,945 --> 01:11:26,743
Thank you. And I know
how you feel about me.

1496
01:11:26,781 --> 01:11:28,578
It's just that you can't...

1497
01:11:28,616 --> 01:11:31,676
you can't expect somebody
who you've just met...

1498
01:11:31,719 --> 01:11:33,710
somebody who hardly
knows you...

1499
01:11:33,755 --> 01:11:35,347
to suddenly say...

1500
01:11:37,792 --> 01:11:39,726
I love you.

1501
01:11:39,761 --> 01:11:41,388
I understand. That's okay.

1502
01:11:41,429 --> 01:11:44,091
No, I love you.

1503
01:11:44,132 --> 01:11:45,690
I do!

1504
01:11:45,733 --> 01:11:48,201
I do! I said it!

1505
01:11:48,236 --> 01:11:49,635
You love me?

1506
01:11:49,671 --> 01:11:52,834
Yes! I love you.

1507
01:11:53,775 --> 01:11:54,742
Whoa!

1508
01:11:54,776 --> 01:11:55,743
Would you stop?

1509
01:11:55,777 --> 01:11:58,769
Uncle Albert, would you please
cut that out?

1510
01:11:58,813 --> 01:12:01,680
I can do it myself now.

1511
01:12:13,294 --> 01:12:15,854
Wahoo.

1512
01:12:16,998 --> 01:12:18,795
Did you feel that?

1513
01:12:18,833 --> 01:12:19,959
Ja!

1514
01:12:20,034 --> 01:12:22,662
Somewhere, an atom
collided with an atom

1515
01:12:22,704 --> 01:12:25,172
that collided with
an atom, and so on

1516
01:12:25,206 --> 01:12:26,901
until it collided with us!

1517
01:12:28,276 --> 01:12:29,573
To atoms...

1518
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:32,774
those sexy little kinkies.

1519
01:12:34,515 --> 01:12:36,642
Suppose you think you're
in love with this...

1520
01:12:36,684 --> 01:12:37,981
this mechanic, do you?

1521
01:12:38,019 --> 01:12:39,680
Yes! Ed!

1522
01:12:39,721 --> 01:12:41,450
I'm in love with him!

1523
01:12:41,489 --> 01:12:42,786
Let me explain...

1524
01:12:43,825 --> 01:12:44,792
Oh...

1525
01:12:44,826 --> 01:12:46,088
it's an infatuation.

1526
01:12:46,127 --> 01:12:47,321
It's not love.

1527
01:12:47,362 --> 01:12:50,991
He's pleasant-looking,
he's, he's popular...

1528
01:12:51,065 --> 01:12:52,726
Uncle Albert likes him,

1529
01:12:52,767 --> 01:12:56,203
so, naturally, you feel
attracted, but it...

1530
01:12:56,237 --> 01:12:58,899
it won't last.

1531
01:12:58,940 --> 01:13:01,807
What we have will last:

1532
01:13:01,843 --> 01:13:04,437
Common aims
and interests...

1533
01:13:04,479 --> 01:13:06,208
verbal communications...

1534
01:13:06,247 --> 01:13:08,943
financial security...

1535
01:13:09,017 --> 01:13:11,747
intellectual compatibility.

1536
01:13:11,786 --> 01:13:13,447
What about love?

1537
01:13:16,391 --> 01:13:19,292
Sounds like a hundred-dollar
brake job, Frank.

1538
01:13:19,327 --> 01:13:21,420
Busted tappets. Ed?

1539
01:13:21,462 --> 01:13:22,952
Huh?

1540
01:13:23,064 --> 01:13:24,929
What do you think?

1541
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:28,798
She loves me.

1542
01:13:31,139 --> 01:13:32,868
I thought that was the idea.

1543
01:13:32,907 --> 01:13:34,465
You haven't told
her, have you?

1544
01:13:34,509 --> 01:13:35,567
I've been trying.

1545
01:13:35,610 --> 01:13:37,635
Ah, tell 'em nothing,
that's what I say.

1546
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:39,146
It's not that hard.

1547
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:41,307
You just call her up and say,

1548
01:13:41,349 --> 01:13:44,147
"Hello. I'm a lying
grease monkey."

1549
01:13:44,185 --> 01:13:46,312
Leave me alone, will you?

1550
01:13:46,354 --> 01:13:48,754
It's going to be all right.

1551
01:13:48,790 --> 01:13:51,156
She loves me.

1552
01:14:06,941 --> 01:14:08,704
Will it work?

1553
01:14:08,743 --> 01:14:12,042
Will it work?

1554
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,570
You never know.

1555
01:14:13,614 --> 01:14:17,641
Hmm... I've seen
this before.

1556
01:14:17,685 --> 01:14:20,279
Well, yes, it's been
in all the papers:

1557
01:14:20,321 --> 01:14:21,948
Ed Walters' cold fusion.

1558
01:14:22,023 --> 01:14:24,548
No, no, I mean
years ago...

1559
01:14:24,592 --> 01:14:25,820
somewhere.

1560
01:14:28,930 --> 01:14:31,899
First I want to say,
"I lie you...

1561
01:14:31,933 --> 01:14:33,867
"l-I love you.

1562
01:14:33,901 --> 01:14:35,368
I'm a I... a liar."

1563
01:14:45,046 --> 01:14:46,536
There's been some things

1564
01:14:46,581 --> 01:14:49,209
that I haven't been
completely honest about,

1565
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:51,047
and, um, I would like the...

1566
01:14:52,286 --> 01:14:54,151
Just a minute, Catherine.

1567
01:14:59,060 --> 01:14:59,992
Edward Walters?

1568
01:15:00,061 --> 01:15:00,993
Yes?

1569
01:15:01,062 --> 01:15:02,086
Hey!

1570
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:04,064
Quiet. Speak when
you're spoken to.

1571
01:15:04,098 --> 01:15:06,123
Act natural. Keep
the answers short.

1572
01:15:06,167 --> 01:15:08,158
Edward... Edward,
I want you to meet

1573
01:15:08,202 --> 01:15:10,932
the President
of the United States.

1574
01:15:10,972 --> 01:15:11,939
Ike?!

1575
01:15:12,006 --> 01:15:13,200
You're... you're...

1576
01:15:13,241 --> 01:15:14,401
you're the...

1577
01:15:14,442 --> 01:15:16,307
You're President Eisenhower.

1578
01:15:16,344 --> 01:15:18,608
Well, at least until
the next election.

1579
01:15:18,646 --> 01:15:24,050
Um, some special...
occasion?

1580
01:15:24,085 --> 01:15:26,178
Oh, um...

1581
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:28,518
I'm expecting someone...

1582
01:15:28,556 --> 01:15:31,047
um... a friend...

1583
01:15:31,092 --> 01:15:32,320
Catherine.

1584
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:33,327
Catherine Boyd?

1585
01:15:33,361 --> 01:15:34,328
Yes.

1586
01:15:34,362 --> 01:15:35,488
Albert Einstein's niece.

1587
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:36,963
I have to tell her something.

1588
01:15:36,998 --> 01:15:37,965
Ah.

1589
01:15:37,999 --> 01:15:40,467
Well, son,
about this engine...

1590
01:15:40,501 --> 01:15:43,766
Uh, when can we see
a working prototype?

1591
01:15:43,805 --> 01:15:45,204
A-A prototype?

1592
01:15:45,239 --> 01:15:46,399
The Russians have announced

1593
01:15:46,441 --> 01:15:48,705
that they'll have a working
model within the year.

1594
01:15:48,743 --> 01:15:51,211
The President would like to make
an announcement

1595
01:15:51,245 --> 01:15:52,234
we are building

1596
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:53,804
a prototype here
in New Jersey.

1597
01:15:53,848 --> 01:15:55,611
We have a press
conference tonight.

1598
01:15:55,650 --> 01:15:56,981
7:00 at the symposium.

1599
01:15:57,018 --> 01:15:58,076
I'd like to be
able to tell them

1600
01:15:58,119 --> 01:15:59,780
we'll have something
ready by say, um...

1601
01:15:59,821 --> 01:16:00,810
7:00?

1602
01:16:08,930 --> 01:16:11,398
Then Eisenhower tells
everyone the good news!

1603
01:16:11,432 --> 01:16:12,729
There's good news?

1604
01:16:12,767 --> 01:16:14,064
About the prototype!

1605
01:16:14,102 --> 01:16:15,729
Does Edward know this?

1606
01:16:15,770 --> 01:16:17,795
Sure! It was
practically his idea!

1607
01:16:17,839 --> 01:16:18,806
Come on, let's go!

1608
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:21,934
They're waiting for us
out front!

1609
01:16:25,513 --> 01:16:27,447
Oh, my god.

1610
01:16:29,984 --> 01:16:32,248
Excuse me.

1611
01:16:32,286 --> 01:16:33,583
Catherine Boyd?

1612
01:16:33,621 --> 01:16:36,181
I met your friend Edward.

1613
01:16:36,224 --> 01:16:38,522
You must be very proud.

1614
01:16:38,559 --> 01:16:42,393
I have very strong
feelings about him.

1615
01:16:45,967 --> 01:16:47,594
We should leave the country!

1616
01:16:47,635 --> 01:16:48,693
Don't panic!

1617
01:16:48,736 --> 01:16:49,964
When should we panic...

1618
01:16:50,037 --> 01:16:51,766
when they shoot
us for treason?

1619
01:16:51,806 --> 01:16:53,671
They don't shoot you
for treason.

1620
01:16:53,708 --> 01:16:55,232
I think it's electrocution.

1621
01:17:00,815 --> 01:17:03,340
Ed. It's Ed!

1622
01:17:03,384 --> 01:17:04,908
Where's Catherine?!

1623
01:17:04,986 --> 01:17:07,648
With Eisenhower!

1624
01:17:14,095 --> 01:17:15,153
Back!

1625
01:17:15,196 --> 01:17:18,165
Stay back, sir!

1626
01:17:38,119 --> 01:17:40,349
Catherine! Stop!

1627
01:17:43,224 --> 01:17:44,589
- Isn't that, uh...?
- Walters!

1628
01:17:44,625 --> 01:17:45,592
Ed!

1629
01:17:45,626 --> 01:17:47,457
Catherine!

1630
01:17:48,696 --> 01:17:50,061
Catherine! Stop!

1631
01:17:50,097 --> 01:17:51,962
Congratulations,
young lady.

1632
01:17:52,033 --> 01:17:55,093
I felt the same way
when I proposed to Mamie.

1633
01:17:55,136 --> 01:17:56,899
Mr. President,
I think you'd better get...

1634
01:17:56,938 --> 01:17:58,701
It's okay. Okay.
Stop the car.

1635
01:18:07,448 --> 01:18:08,915
Isn't that Ed Walters?

1636
01:18:08,983 --> 01:18:09,915
Yeah, that's him.

1637
01:18:09,984 --> 01:18:10,916
Some kind of problem?

1638
01:18:11,018 --> 01:18:13,009
Why'd we stop?

1639
01:18:20,127 --> 01:18:21,094
Catherine...

1640
01:18:21,128 --> 01:18:22,152
Don't talk to me,

1641
01:18:22,196 --> 01:18:24,255
you liar, you fake,
you phony...

1642
01:18:24,298 --> 01:18:25,356
You found out.

1643
01:18:25,399 --> 01:18:27,367
How could you think
I was that stupid?

1644
01:18:27,401 --> 01:18:28,800
I don't think
you're stupid.

1645
01:18:28,836 --> 01:18:29,825
How'd you find out?

1646
01:18:29,870 --> 01:18:30,894
I figured it out, okay?

1647
01:18:30,938 --> 01:18:31,927
I just figured it out.

1648
01:18:32,006 --> 01:18:34,236
I put two and two together...
V over R equals H...

1649
01:18:34,275 --> 01:18:36,300
The formula?
That's fantastic! That's great!

1650
01:18:36,344 --> 01:18:38,642
Stop it! You fake...

1651
01:18:38,679 --> 01:18:39,941
Just kiss me.

1652
01:18:39,981 --> 01:18:40,948
What?

1653
01:18:40,982 --> 01:18:43,143
Be right there, lke!

1654
01:18:43,184 --> 01:18:44,879
Take your time!

1655
01:18:44,919 --> 01:18:47,683
The president thinks
that you are proposing to me,

1656
01:18:47,722 --> 01:18:48,711
so just kiss me.

1657
01:18:48,756 --> 01:18:50,690
We're in a lot
of trouble here.

1658
01:18:56,797 --> 01:18:57,957
Looks like a yes to me.

1659
01:18:57,999 --> 01:18:58,966
Yes, it does.

1660
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:00,968
Ow!

1661
01:19:01,002 --> 01:19:02,162
You... you mechanic.

1662
01:19:02,203 --> 01:19:03,864
See? That's all
I am to you...

1663
01:19:03,904 --> 01:19:05,269
just a mechanic, right?

1664
01:19:05,306 --> 01:19:06,273
Yeah!

1665
01:19:06,307 --> 01:19:07,501
Is your name really Ed?

1666
01:19:07,541 --> 01:19:08,508
Yes, it's Ed.

1667
01:19:08,542 --> 01:19:09,736
Do you really work
at a garage?

1668
01:19:09,777 --> 01:19:11,642
Yes, a garage where you
fell in love with me

1669
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:13,374
when you first saw me,
remember?

1670
01:19:13,414 --> 01:19:14,711
That's real. That's true.

1671
01:19:14,749 --> 01:19:15,807
That hurts!

1672
01:19:15,850 --> 01:19:16,908
One second, lke!

1673
01:19:19,253 --> 01:19:20,220
Ow! Ow!

1674
01:19:20,254 --> 01:19:22,586
Oh, for God's sake...

1675
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:23,590
Ow!

1676
01:19:23,624 --> 01:19:26,855
Ow! Ow!

1677
01:19:26,894 --> 01:19:27,861
You know what?

1678
01:19:27,895 --> 01:19:28,862
What?

1679
01:19:28,896 --> 01:19:29,863
You had to know.

1680
01:19:29,897 --> 01:19:31,558
Something in you had to know.

1681
01:19:31,599 --> 01:19:32,566
You're not dumb.

1682
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:33,658
Yes, I am!

1683
01:19:33,701 --> 01:19:35,669
I think you wanted
to go along with it.

1684
01:19:35,703 --> 01:19:36,863
As a matter of fact,
I think you needed to.

1685
01:19:36,904 --> 01:19:38,735
In a way,
you should be thanking me.

1686
01:19:38,773 --> 01:19:40,502
Thanking you?

1687
01:19:40,541 --> 01:19:41,508
Ow!

1688
01:19:41,542 --> 01:19:42,509
Geez...

1689
01:19:42,543 --> 01:19:44,306
Be right there, lke!

1690
01:19:46,047 --> 01:19:47,412
You bit me!

1691
01:19:47,448 --> 01:19:48,415
Aah!

1692
01:19:48,449 --> 01:19:49,416
Sorry, Ed.

1693
01:19:49,450 --> 01:19:50,849
Sorry about that.

1694
01:19:51,852 --> 01:19:53,114
Listen, Ed.

1695
01:19:53,154 --> 01:19:54,314
You're right.

1696
01:19:54,355 --> 01:19:56,687
I've learned quite a bit
from you, you know?

1697
01:19:56,724 --> 01:19:58,624
I have a...
I have a great brain

1698
01:19:58,659 --> 01:20:00,149
and I should trust that.

1699
01:20:00,194 --> 01:20:01,161
Yeah.

1700
01:20:01,195 --> 01:20:02,958
And it's not about
what you do.

1701
01:20:02,997 --> 01:20:04,328
It's about who you are.

1702
01:20:04,365 --> 01:20:06,162
So, I've learned that
from you.

1703
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:07,189
So, thank you.

1704
01:20:15,176 --> 01:20:16,143
Fake.

1705
01:20:16,177 --> 01:20:18,873
Albert...
what's going on?

1706
01:20:21,148 --> 01:20:23,673
Catherine has
just found out

1707
01:20:23,718 --> 01:20:27,210
that Edward is not
really a scientist.

1708
01:20:27,254 --> 01:20:29,916
He is simply
an automobile mechanic.

1709
01:20:29,957 --> 01:20:32,721
What the hell does
an automobile mechanic

1710
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:34,284
know about cold fusion?

1711
01:20:34,328 --> 01:20:36,387
Nothing. It's all a big lie.

1712
01:20:36,430 --> 01:20:38,762
April Fool's?

1713
01:20:40,801 --> 01:20:41,893
We meant no harm.

1714
01:20:41,936 --> 01:20:43,460
Just foolish
old men...

1715
01:20:43,504 --> 01:20:46,473
So I was right about
the cold fusion, wasn't I?

1716
01:20:46,507 --> 01:20:47,804
Catherine, do you realize

1717
01:20:47,842 --> 01:20:49,639
that you have proven
conclusively

1718
01:20:49,677 --> 01:20:51,338
that my approach
is impossible?

1719
01:20:51,379 --> 01:20:52,607
Conclusively.

1720
01:20:52,646 --> 01:20:55,274
I knew that,
but you said that...

1721
01:20:55,316 --> 01:20:56,510
Ja. I meant that

1722
01:20:56,550 --> 01:20:59,018
I could not prove it
or disprove it.

1723
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,520
Therefore, I could
not publish it.

1724
01:21:01,555 --> 01:21:03,921
I did something
that you couldn't do?

1725
01:21:03,958 --> 01:21:06,392
Ja. It's, uh, mathematics.

1726
01:21:06,427 --> 01:21:09,692
I was always terrible
at mathematics.

1727
01:21:09,730 --> 01:21:10,992
Professor...

1728
01:21:13,968 --> 01:21:14,069
Ed Walters' atomic fuel theory.

1729
01:21:14,069 --> 01:21:18,130
Ed Walters' atomic fuel theory.

1730
01:21:18,173 --> 01:21:21,609
An unpublished paper
of Albert Einstein's

1731
01:21:21,643 --> 01:21:24,203
written 30 years ago.

1732
01:21:24,245 --> 01:21:26,611
Gentlemen, they are identical.

1733
01:21:26,648 --> 01:21:30,675
In every respect, identical.

1734
01:21:30,718 --> 01:21:32,913
Are you accusing Ed Walters
of plagiarism?

1735
01:21:32,954 --> 01:21:34,353
Hardly.

1736
01:21:34,389 --> 01:21:38,086
I'm accusing Ed Walters
and Professor Einstein

1737
01:21:38,126 --> 01:21:42,620
and his colleagues...
of, um...

1738
01:21:42,664 --> 01:21:46,930
of outright fraud.

1739
01:21:46,968 --> 01:21:50,062
Cold fusion is nothing more
than a hoax.

1740
01:21:55,977 --> 01:21:57,968
If you will please bear with us

1741
01:21:58,012 --> 01:22:01,106
Professor Einstein
has a statement to make.

1742
01:22:01,149 --> 01:22:03,481
Thank you, Mr. President.

1743
01:22:03,518 --> 01:22:09,354
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dr. James Morland is correct.

1744
01:22:10,758 --> 01:22:12,851
Cold fusion is a hoax.

1745
01:22:12,894 --> 01:22:16,921
A hoax so brilliant, so daring,
so secret

1746
01:22:16,965 --> 01:22:20,059
not more than five people
on the planet Earth

1747
01:22:20,101 --> 01:22:21,659
know about it.

1748
01:22:21,703 --> 01:22:25,503
We called it
"Operation Red Cabbage."

1749
01:22:26,341 --> 01:22:28,969
But now, we can reveal

1750
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:31,979
through the efforts
of my colleague, Miss Boyd

1751
01:22:32,013 --> 01:22:35,380
and Mr. Walters...
two of the finest minds

1752
01:22:35,416 --> 01:22:40,752
it has ever been my privilege
to know...

1753
01:22:40,788 --> 01:22:45,589
we have proven the Russian claim
to have leapt ahead

1754
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:48,755
in the space race
with cold fusion

1755
01:22:48,796 --> 01:22:51,060
is nothing but hot air.

1756
01:22:57,272 --> 01:23:03,370
Personally, I think any race of
this nature... arms or space...

1757
01:23:03,411 --> 01:23:06,505
is complete foolishness.

1758
01:23:06,548 --> 01:23:09,608
Thank you very much.

1759
01:23:14,022 --> 01:23:15,512
A master stroke, gentlemen.

1760
01:23:15,557 --> 01:23:17,184
A triumph for the institute.

1761
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:22,227
Catherine, darling,
you must understand.

1762
01:23:22,263 --> 01:23:24,595
I said what I said
in good faith.

1763
01:23:24,632 --> 01:23:27,601
Uncle Albert, that's not going
to work this time.

1764
01:23:27,635 --> 01:23:34,063
Unfortunately, Catherine,
this is the real thing.

1765
01:23:34,108 --> 01:23:36,474
Please, I go to the hospital.

1766
01:23:44,619 --> 01:23:49,818
Boys, please,
it's just a little flutter.

1767
01:23:49,857 --> 01:23:51,916
Please, go out, see the comet.

1768
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:54,554
Go get some girls.

1769
01:23:54,596 --> 01:23:56,257
Should we get one for you?

1770
01:23:56,297 --> 01:23:58,288
Ja, a redhead.

1771
01:23:58,333 --> 01:23:59,391
Stay, Edward.

1772
01:23:59,434 --> 01:24:00,924
Good-bye, boys.

1773
01:24:00,969 --> 01:24:02,163
Thanks for coming.

1774
01:24:02,203 --> 01:24:05,695
I will see you all shortly.

1775
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:06,900
Up there.

1776
01:24:08,776 --> 01:24:13,304
It will be okay in no time.

1777
01:24:13,348 --> 01:24:16,442
I thought you said
that time doesn't exist.

1778
01:24:16,484 --> 01:24:17,781
He said nothing.

1779
01:24:17,819 --> 01:24:20,947
You know,
I always imagined heaven

1780
01:24:21,022 --> 01:24:23,616
to be one enormous library.

1781
01:24:23,658 --> 01:24:27,025
Only you can't take out
the books.

1782
01:24:30,431 --> 01:24:32,729
Oh, I need something
from my trousers.

1783
01:24:32,767 --> 01:24:34,792
Oh, I'll get it.

1784
01:24:34,836 --> 01:24:37,896
It's in the left-hand pocket.

1785
01:24:37,939 --> 01:24:39,406
The left hand.

1786
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:41,067
No, the other left hand.

1787
01:24:41,109 --> 01:24:43,270
What am I looking for?

1788
01:24:43,311 --> 01:24:44,278
Ja, that's it.

1789
01:24:44,312 --> 01:24:45,973
You found it.
Thank you.

1790
01:24:46,014 --> 01:24:49,108
Bring it here, please.

1791
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:53,917
Ja, my compass.

1792
01:24:53,955 --> 01:24:58,153
My memory is...

1793
01:24:58,192 --> 01:25:07,294
of my father
when I was five years old.

1794
01:25:07,335 --> 01:25:09,860
I think I was sick
in bed then, too.

1795
01:25:09,904 --> 01:25:13,465
He gave me this compass.

1796
01:25:13,508 --> 01:25:20,937
When I first held it in my hand,
I was wonder-struck

1797
01:25:21,015 --> 01:25:26,920
by what force,
invisible and unfelt

1798
01:25:26,954 --> 01:25:29,821
could be holding the needle.

1799
01:25:33,294 --> 01:25:36,957
Here, Edward, you take this

1800
01:25:37,065 --> 01:25:39,727
so that you never lose
your way.

1801
01:25:39,767 --> 01:25:42,702
And you keep your sense
of wonder.

1802
01:25:45,106 --> 01:25:47,700
You both have good hearts.

1803
01:25:50,545 --> 01:25:56,541
Don't let your brain
interfere with your heart.

1804
01:26:11,899 --> 01:26:13,366
I'd really love to talk, Ed.

1805
01:26:13,401 --> 01:26:14,698
Listen, Catherine,

1806
01:26:14,736 --> 01:26:17,261
I never meant for this
to get as crazy as it did.

1807
01:26:17,305 --> 01:26:22,072
If I've hurt you in any way
I'm very sorry.

1808
01:26:27,281 --> 01:26:31,240
For one brief moment there
I was actually taken seriously

1809
01:26:31,285 --> 01:26:36,484
by some pretty...
extraordinary people.

1810
01:26:36,524 --> 01:26:40,119
And that's never
happened to me before.

1811
01:26:40,161 --> 01:26:42,925
It felt great.

1812
01:26:42,964 --> 01:26:46,866
I just hope at some point
that you can

1813
01:26:46,901 --> 01:26:49,802
truly believe how
extraordinary you are.

1814
01:27:03,317 --> 01:27:04,807
I'll miss you.

1815
01:27:11,492 --> 01:27:11,592
So what are you saying?

1816
01:27:11,592 --> 01:27:13,617
So what are you saying?

1817
01:27:13,660 --> 01:27:14,786
If we hadn't interfered

1818
01:27:14,828 --> 01:27:16,455
they would have
ended up together?

1819
01:27:16,496 --> 01:27:17,929
Everything affects
everything.

1820
01:27:17,998 --> 01:27:20,796
I believe everything
will turn out fine.

1821
01:27:20,834 --> 01:27:22,131
Why?

1822
01:27:22,169 --> 01:27:24,797
Because I would rather be
an optimist and a fool

1823
01:27:24,838 --> 01:27:26,396
than a pessimist and right.

1824
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:27,498
We're all fools.

1825
01:27:27,541 --> 01:27:29,805
We should have
taken the elevator.

1826
01:27:29,843 --> 01:27:31,140
Boys, please.

1827
01:27:31,178 --> 01:27:35,205
You're going to wake up
the nurses.

1828
01:27:40,821 --> 01:27:42,345
23 degrees up.

1829
01:27:42,389 --> 01:27:43,651
No, no, no.
24 degrees.

1830
01:27:43,690 --> 01:27:45,749
It would be
22 degrees down...

1831
01:27:48,662 --> 01:27:49,924
Please, just do it.

1832
01:27:49,963 --> 01:27:50,930
Why? Why?

1833
01:27:50,964 --> 01:27:54,331
A dying man's wish.

1834
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:55,357
In time.

1835
01:27:55,402 --> 01:27:58,599
But since time doesn't exist...

1836
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:02,268
What do you see?

1837
01:28:02,309 --> 01:28:05,608
I see... I see the road
to the observatory.

1838
01:28:05,646 --> 01:28:06,738
And, and?

1839
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:08,179
And Catherine.

1840
01:28:08,215 --> 01:28:09,375
And?

1841
01:28:09,416 --> 01:28:12,715
She is going
towards stargazers' field.

1842
01:28:12,753 --> 01:28:14,311
Wait a minute.

1843
01:28:14,354 --> 01:28:16,618
That's where Edward went.

1844
01:28:16,657 --> 01:28:20,286
Boy, if ever there was a time
for an accident.

1845
01:28:20,327 --> 01:28:24,787
Sometimes, accidents
need a little help.

1846
01:28:24,831 --> 01:28:27,925
God does not play dice
with the universe

1847
01:28:27,968 --> 01:28:28,935
but I will.

1848
01:28:29,036 --> 01:28:30,469
What kind
of a thing is that?

1849
01:28:30,504 --> 01:28:32,665
What is that?

1850
01:28:32,706 --> 01:28:34,936
This is a transmitter.

1851
01:28:34,975 --> 01:28:36,636
Watch.

1852
01:28:42,849 --> 01:28:43,941
Wunderbar!

1853
01:28:44,051 --> 01:28:45,575
Oh!

1854
01:28:45,619 --> 01:28:47,211
Great.

1855
01:28:47,254 --> 01:28:48,881
Push it down.

1856
01:28:48,922 --> 01:28:50,617
Push it down.

1857
01:28:51,692 --> 01:28:54,252
Ah! No!

1858
01:28:54,294 --> 01:28:56,262
I'm going to look at...

1859
01:28:56,296 --> 01:28:58,059
Please.

1860
01:29:01,068 --> 01:29:03,263
Enough! Enough already!

1861
01:29:03,303 --> 01:29:05,100
I want her back in one piece.

1862
01:29:05,138 --> 01:29:06,901
What's happening now, Albert?

1863
01:29:06,973 --> 01:29:08,463
The motor has died.

1864
01:29:08,508 --> 01:29:11,170
She's turning off the road
into stargazers' field.

1865
01:29:13,447 --> 01:29:14,812
Let me see!

1866
01:29:40,006 --> 01:29:42,941
Uh... it just happened.

1867
01:29:42,976 --> 01:29:44,307
Just boom!

1868
01:29:46,046 --> 01:29:47,877
Boom.

1869
01:29:49,983 --> 01:29:52,178
Do you believe in accidents?

1870
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:55,044
No.

1871
01:30:17,177 --> 01:30:20,977
Oh.

1872
01:30:21,014 --> 01:30:22,641
This is so right.

1873
01:30:22,682 --> 01:30:26,118
This is the way
I wanted to see it.

1874
01:30:30,657 --> 01:30:34,252
Have you ever heard
of the Seven Sacred Pools?

1875
01:30:34,294 --> 01:30:36,956
In Hawaii?

1876
01:30:38,632 --> 01:30:40,429
Are you all right, Albert?

1877
01:30:40,467 --> 01:30:43,925
Ja, this is very
good for my heart.

1878
01:30:43,970 --> 01:30:45,597
Oh, my god!

1879
01:30:45,639 --> 01:30:46,970
Look!

1880
01:30:49,709 --> 01:30:50,698
Look!

1881
01:30:50,744 --> 01:30:53,178
Hi, Daddy.

1882
01:30:53,213 --> 01:30:55,443
I missed you.

1883
01:30:55,482 --> 01:30:58,781
This is Ed, the man I love.

1884
01:31:02,255 --> 01:31:03,882
Out of this world.

1885
01:31:09,830 --> 01:31:11,525
What's happening?

1886
01:31:33,887 --> 01:31:36,287
Wahoo.

1887
01:31:38,124 --> 01:31:39,819
Wahoo.

1888
01:35:46,124 --> 01:35:47,819
5@y3

1889
