（庆祝博伊德彗星 莫扎特）

3
00:01:34,008 --> 00:01:36,332
不不，不不，首先你应该找到…
No, no. No, no. First, you should find out

4
00:01:36,345 --> 00:01:39,230
宇宙的本质属性是什么
what is the essential nature of the universe.

5
00:01:39,273 --> 00:01:42,959
宇宙是一个固有非理性的地方…
Is the universe an inherently irrational place

6
00:01:43,033 --> 00:01:44,461
随机而又混乱吗？
random and chaotic?

7
00:01:44,503 --> 00:01:45,861
对，但是你…
Ya, but you...

8
00:01:51,932 --> 00:01:53,269
花栗鼠，你的勺子
Chipmunk, your spoon.

9
00:01:54,945 --> 00:01:56,433
你的勺子…掉地上了
Your spoon--it's on the floor.

10
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:59,018
你们准备点餐了吗？
Are you ready to order?

11
00:01:59,081 --> 00:02:00,107
呃，是的，我想是的
Uh, yes, I think.

12
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,947
照惯例，有劳
The usual, please.

13
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:04,563
不，我要来一杯咖啡
No. I'll have a cup of coffee

14
00:02:04,586 --> 00:02:05,673
还有一个玉米松饼，有劳
and a corn muffin, please.

15
00:02:06,908 --> 00:02:08,476
亲，你的惯例就是这些
Darling, that is your usual.

16
00:02:09,931 --> 00:02:11,788
哦，那我就要那些吧
Well, I'll have that then.

17
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:13,400
- 好的  - 谢谢
- Okay. - Thank you.

18
00:02:13,485 --> 00:02:14,900
- 啊哈  - 怎么？
- Aha! - What?

19
00:02:14,925 --> 00:02:19,008
它每平方厘米流失11000个分子
It loses 11,000 molecules per square centimeter

20
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:20,357
每秒
per second.

21
00:02:20,471 --> 00:02:21,358
什么东西？
What does?

22
00:02:21,402 --> 00:02:23,374
那颗彗星
The comet.

23
00:02:24,418 --> 00:02:25,523
来
Now...

24
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,886
这些你最喜欢哪个？
which one of these do you like best?

25
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,875
这是性格测试吗？
Is this a personality test?

26
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,847
呣，算是个惊喜吧
Mm, it's a sort of surprise.

27
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,423
它们都一样
They're all the same.

28
00:02:33,676 --> 00:02:35,044
什么？不不，看
What? No, no. Look.

29
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:36,105
那是碧绿色
That's aquamarine.

30
00:02:36,148 --> 00:02:38,436
那是蓝绿，那个是藻绿
That's blue-green, and that's algae.

31
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,409
哦，你知道在原子层面上没有颜色这种东西
Well, you know at the atomic level there's no such thing as color.

32
00:02:43,624 --> 00:02:47,034
不过，他们那次的确在比利时做过那个研究
Though they did do that study in Belgium that time--

33
00:02:47,064 --> 00:02:47,504
等等
Wait.

34
00:02:47,615 --> 00:02:48,616
还是在丹麦？
or was it Denmark?

35
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,447
- 唠叨  - 总之...
- Babbling. - Anyway.

36
00:02:49,531 --> 00:02:50,622
唠叨
Babbling.

37
00:02:50,646 --> 00:02:52,433
总之，重点在于…
Anyway, the point was that...

38
00:02:52,476 --> 00:02:53,538
重点在于什么？
What was the point?

39
00:02:53,582 --> 00:02:57,176
哦，既然质子远小于光波
Oh, that since protons are so much smaller than light waves...

40
00:02:57,764 --> 00:02:58,722
藻绿
Algae.

41
00:02:58,766 --> 00:02:59,554
谢谢
Thank you.

42
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:02,598
既然质子远小于光波
Since protons are so much smaller than light waves

43
00:03:02,623 --> 00:03:05,793
他们怎么能看到它来起头呢？
how could they ever see it to begin with?

44
00:03:07,274 --> 00:03:09,058
哦，那些丹麦人
Oh, those Danes.

45
00:03:12,004 --> 00:03:16,835
还是说在所有事物的背后都有一个基本的秩序？
Or is there a fundamental order underlying all things?

46
00:03:16,904 --> 00:03:20,035
{\a6}（坠落的星尘里有现金）

47
00:03:21,528 --> 00:03:23,246
喂，惊奇队长？
Hey, Captain Marvel?

48
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,378
沙赞？
Shazam?

49
00:03:25,321 --> 00:03:26,884
哦，谢谢
Oh, thanks.

50
00:03:27,328 --> 00:03:29,654
我刚才在读博伊德彗星的报道
I was just reading about Boyd's comet.

51
00:03:29,687 --> 00:03:30,732
博伊德什么？
Boyd's what?

52
00:03:31,275 --> 00:03:32,781
彗星？天上的？
Comet? Like in the sky?

53
00:03:32,824 --> 00:03:34,113
他们说它很快要到这里来了
They say it's going to be here soon.

54
00:03:34,126 --> 00:03:35,954
我们有可能看到它
We're going to be able to see it.

55
00:03:36,538 --> 00:03:39,455
你们知道为什么彗星的尾巴总是远离太阳那面吗？
You know why a comet's tail always points away from the sun?

56
00:03:39,526 --> 00:03:40,394
不知道
No.

57
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,395
想知道吗？
Want to know?

58
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:42,431
- 不  - 不
- No. - No.

59
00:03:42,474 --> 00:03:44,920
因为它其实根本不是一条尾巴，它是…
'Cause it's actually not a tail at all. It's...

60
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:48,184
它是太阳照亮的气体颗粒群
It's bits of gas that the sun lights up.

61
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,174
我们地球人会尽量记住这一点
We earthlings will try to keep that in mind.

62
00:03:51,218 --> 00:03:55,239
就像一个500英里长的泽西喷灯
Kind of like a 500-mile-long Jersey torch.

63
00:03:55,863 --> 00:03:56,584
哇
Wow.

64
00:03:57,627 --> 00:03:59,326
那一定是真的
It must be true.

65
00:03:59,369 --> 00:04:03,922
该事实仍然说明某些事件是完全偶发的
The fact remains that certain events are strictly accidental.

66
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,766
什么事实？
What fact?

67
00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:09,668
哦，天啊
Oh, my,

68
00:04:10,365 --> 00:04:11,468
看看时间
look at the time.

69
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,514
没问题
No problem.

70
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:18,345
是因为春天的关系
It's because it's spring.

71
00:04:18,388 --> 00:04:22,003
每一样东西在春天里都会经历剧变，你说呢？
Everything goes through upheaval in the spring, wouldn't you say?

72
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:23,872
别这样，小贱人
Come on, you little bitch.

73
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,286
听着像是来生意了
Sounds like business.

74
00:04:26,359 --> 00:04:27,467
名爵TF跑车
M.G.T.F. Roadster.

75
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:28,668
奥斯汀希利
Austin-Healey.

76
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:29,769
凯迪拉克Coupe
Cadillac coupe.

77
00:04:30,512 --> 00:04:32,270
- 一块  - 跟你赌了
- Buck. - You're on.

78
00:04:32,615 --> 00:04:33,316
进气阀爆裂
Blown intake valve.

79
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,748
不，分电盘盖破裂
No. Cracked distributor cap.

80
00:04:34,802 --> 00:04:35,840
消声器报废
Busted muffler.

81
00:04:37,928 --> 00:04:42,568
我们都是某一滑稽的宇宙事故的受害者
Are we all victims of some comic cosmic accident

82
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,607
还是说有一个大设计？
or is there a grand design?

83
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,813
哦，真走运
Oh, what luck.

84
00:04:51,904 --> 00:04:53,502
- TC跑车  - 是一辆TF
- T.C. Roadster. - That's a T.F.

85
00:04:55,634 --> 00:04:56,771
一对大学上等人
A couple of college swells.

86
00:04:56,805 --> 00:04:58,162
你应付他们，艾德
You handle them, Ed.

87
00:05:00,512 --> 00:05:03,120
嗨，哪里有问题了？
Hi, what seems to be the problem?

88
00:05:07,924 --> 00:05:10,978
你们这里有人懂怎么修理英国车的吗？
Do you have anyone here who knows how to deal with British automobiles?

89
00:05:11,022 --> 00:05:14,660
我真的不希望有人拿根尖棍子在里面乱戳
I really don't want anyone just poking around in there with a sharp stick.

90
00:05:17,062 --> 00:05:19,818
我看看引擎盖下面没问题吧？
Would it be all right if I looked under the bonnet?

91
00:05:19,858 --> 00:05:21,157
哦，至少他称之为引擎盖
Well, at least he called it a bonnet.

92
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,401
所以，这就是引擎了，是吧？
so, that's the engine, huh?

93
00:05:27,944 --> 00:05:30,416
你看，我想也许我们应该去别的地方，你说呢？
Um, look, I think, perhaps we ought to go somewhere else, do you?

94
00:05:35,157 --> 00:05:36,121
进气阀，我告诉你
Intake valve, I'm tellin' ya.

95
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,006
消声器报废
Busted muffler.

96
00:05:37,023 --> 00:05:38,429
- 进气阀  - 消声器
- Intake valve. - Busted muffler.

97
00:05:38,442 --> 00:05:39,687
那就是你的问题
That's your problem right there.

98
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:40,448
什么？
What?

99
00:05:40,471 --> 00:05:41,689
你没有火花 {\fs12}热情{\r}
You got no spark.

100
00:05:41,732 --> 00:05:42,690
什么？
What?

101
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:43,652
你没有火花
You have no spark.

102
00:05:43,675 --> 00:05:45,606
对，我听见他说的了，凯瑟琳
Yes, I heard him, Catherine.

103
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:47,172
你觉得这话是什么意思？
What do you think it means?

104
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:48,391
是发电机的问题吗？
Is it the generator?

105
00:05:48,435 --> 00:05:49,349
是线圈？是什么？
The coil? What?

106
00:05:49,392 --> 00:05:50,698
哦，这个难说
Well, it's hard to say.

107
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:53,135
你看，你有一台卢卡斯四型发电机
You see, you have a Lucas type four generator

108
00:05:53,178 --> 00:05:55,631
是12伏特系统，可你知道英国人的
on a 12-volt system, and you know the British.

109
00:05:55,654 --> 00:05:58,902
他们宁愿花时间在仪表盘上粘木头
They'd rather spend time gluing wood on a dashboard

110
00:05:58,946 --> 00:06:01,627
也不愿把电力系统搞好
than getting the electrical system right.

111
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,833
绝妙，可是…
Fascinating, but...

112
00:06:02,913 --> 00:06:05,234
可是这车出了什么毛病？
but what is wrong with the car?

113
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,965
哦，我猜想是你的行程太短
Well, my guess is your stroke is too short

114
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,676
而且你还过早地点火
and you're getting premature ignition.

115
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,070
是不是有过这样的感觉？
Does it ever feel that way?

116
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:16,032
说什么呢？
Like what?

117
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,773
说行程太短了，而且…
Like the stroke is too short and...

118
00:06:17,816 --> 00:06:20,519
还点火过早了？
you're getting premature ignition?

119
00:06:22,973 --> 00:06:24,440
哦，我肯定我不知道你什么意思
Well, I'm sure I don't know what you mean.

120
00:06:26,384 --> 00:06:28,257
你能不能至少暂时把它修好，你觉得呢？
Could you just fix it at least temporarily, do you think?

121
00:06:28,312 --> 00:06:30,346
我说，我们真的落后进度了
I mean, we're really running behind schedule here.

122
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,939
我跟我老板确认一下
I'll check with my boss.

123
00:06:33,222 --> 00:06:33,958
不要走开
Don't go away.

124
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,230
他似乎人挺好
He seems nice enough.

125
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,770
他，他是个穴居人
He's, he's a troglodyte.

126
00:06:43,724 --> 00:06:44,727
进气阀，对吧？
Intake valve, right?

127
00:06:44,761 --> 00:06:45,882
消声器报废？
Busted muffler?

128
00:06:45,926 --> 00:06:47,083
我要娶她
I'm going to marry her.

129
00:06:47,527 --> 00:06:48,854
- 谁？那个贵妇？  - 对
- Who? The dame? - Yeah.

130
00:06:48,872 --> 00:06:49,873
哇，够快的
Wow, that was fast.

131
00:06:49,917 --> 00:06:50,874
车怎么样？
What about the car?

132
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:51,861
分电盘盖破裂
Cracked distributor cap.

133
00:06:51,874 --> 00:06:53,947
你不会相信的，我看着她，她看着我，然后
You wouldn't believe it. I looked at her, she looked at me, and...

134
00:06:54,105 --> 00:06:56,637
就…就发生了，你可以感觉得到
it was... it happened. You could feel it.

135
00:06:56,829 --> 00:06:58,831
就像是死去，只是以一种好的方式
It was like death, but in a good way.

136
00:06:59,215 --> 00:07:00,172
他发癫了
He's going screwy.

137
00:07:00,216 --> 00:07:01,783
啪 啪 啪 啪
Pop, pop, pop, pop.

138
00:07:01,826 --> 00:07:03,100
那是电
It was electric.

139
00:07:03,241 --> 00:07:05,569
然后，然后我亲吻了她
And then, then I kissed her.

140
00:07:06,173 --> 00:07:08,484
你亲了一个顾客？什么时候？
You kissed a customer? When?

141
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:09,556
在未来

他把电极放在老鼠的生殖器上

309
00:14:45,934 --> 00:14:48,858
啊，我们把球拍扔起来打小鸟

what makes you think that she would be better off with you?

318
00:15:18,505 --> 00:15:19,940
我不知道，只是一种感觉

319

一种感觉？
A feeling?

320

00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,679
这话说起来疯狂
This is going to sound crazy.

322
00:15:27,953 --> 00:15:28,942
- 没关系  - 不不
- That's all right. - No, no.

323
00:15:28,985 --> 00:15:32,160
你可以告诉我们，我们这几个都有些疯狂
You can tell us. We are all a little crazy here.

哦，她来到修车厂的时候…
Well, when she came in the garage...

It's like when you're milling a camshaft

或者是在弯道上正撞向挡泥板
or grinding down the curve on a fender.

328
00:15:48,678 --> 00:15:49,832
而就在你正做着的时候

329
00:15:49,876 --> 00:15:52,792
你就是知道一切都会完美运作

每一件东西都会是合适的

00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,234
你曾有过那种感觉吗？
You ever have that feeling?

333
00:16:00,577 --> 00:16:03,436
对，有一次，在1905年

That fellow in the booth calmed down so quickly.

421
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:47,912
对，有意思，是吧？
Yes. Funny, huh?

422
00:20:48,316 --> 00:20:49,310
你的手表呢？
Where's your watch?

423
00:20:49,354 --> 00:20:50,189
啊？
Huh?

424
00:20:50,212 --> 00:20:52,103
你原先戴着一块腕表
You were wearing a wristwatch.

425
00:20:52,247 --> 00:20:54,932
哦，我琢磨着既然时间不存在…
Well, I figured since time doesn't exist--

426
00:20:55,136 --> 00:20:56,496
谁还需要表呢？
who needs a watch?

427
00:21:20,593 --> 00:21:22,442
这一趟非常出色{\fs12} [德语]{\r}

您完全不必客气
You're very welcome.

430
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,774
下次我带上我的护目镜，如何？

431
00:21:27,517 --> 00:21:29,171
好的，博士
All right, doc.

432

你认识他吗？
Do you know him?

438
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,770
我交游广泛
I get around.

439
00:21:59,814 --> 00:22:01,434
你带他坐那玩意儿？
Did you take him on that thing?

440
00:22:01,547 --> 00:22:02,135
嗯哼
Uh-huh.

441
00:22:02,178 --> 00:22:05,930

You took Albert Einstein for a ride on a motorcycle?

442
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:06,647
嗯哼
Uh-huh.

443
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,915
- 噢，可再也别那么干了  - 为什么？
- Well, don't ever do that again. - Why not?

444
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,383
因为他可能会被害死
Because he could've been killed.

445

他喊“哇呼”呢
He went "wahoo."

447
00:22:12,888 --> 00:22:13,737
哇呼？
Wahoo?

00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:18,351
哦，我肯定不知道
Well, I'm sure I don't know.

你上次喊“哇呼”是什么时候？

451
00:22:21,557 --> 00:22:23,425

喂，帮我一下，好吗？

我有点紧张
I'm a little nervous.

460
00:22:45,962 --> 00:22:46,986
哦，真的吗？为什么？
Oh, really? Why?

461
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,685
我正在努力琢磨一个最好的办法邀请你吃晚饭
I'm trying to figure out the best way to ask you to dinner.

462
00:22:49,747 --> 00:22:52,341

but I-I really should be going that way, so...

469

再见
good-bye.

470
00:23:08,321 --> 00:23:10,925
哦，那么说晚饭是谈不上了
Well, then dinner's out of the question.

471

你落下了它

没问题
No problem.

487

怎么？
What?

492

马龙·白兰度
Marlon Brando.

493
00:24:03,447 --> 00:24:04,527
也许不是
Maybe not.

494
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:09,768
那么，詹姆斯？
So, James?

495

Yes?

496
00:24:10,506 --> 00:24:12,103
会是哪里呢？
Where is it to be?

497
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:13,754
什么是哪里，邓肯？
Where is what to be, Duncan?

498

蜜月，老兄，蜜月

你们这对爱情鸟决定了哪里？

500
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:20,921
呃，这个我们还没怎么好好讨论过
Uh, well, we haven't really discussed it much.

501
00:24:20,964 --> 00:24:25,432
呣，不过我想去比属刚果的伊图里森林
Um, though I was thinking the Ituri forest in the Belgian Congo.

502
00:24:25,709 --> 00:24:27,440
伊图里森林，太好了
The Ituri forest. Excellent.

503
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,960
恩布提定居点附近有个俾格米人村落
There's a pygmy village near the Embouti settlement.

504
00:24:30,004 --> 00:24:31,447
你知道那里，是不是，邓肯？
You know it, don't you, Duncan?

505
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:32,537
对啊，那里真是引人入胜
Yes, it's fascinating.

506
00:24:32,781 --> 00:24:35,444
如果你愿意的话，可以说是一个完整的俾格米人套餐
Sort of a complete pygmy package if you'd like.

507
00:24:35,488 --> 00:24:38,239
有好客之心，野猪烧烤
There's hospitality heart, wild boar roast

508
00:24:38,322 --> 00:24:40,662
你在河里洗浴，部落仪式…
you wash in the river, tribal rituals...

509
00:24:40,706 --> 00:24:41,885
诸如此类的事情
that sort of a thing.

510
00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:45,007
就像成为部落的一员，真的
It's like being one of the tribe, really.

511
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,630
这是一生难得的机会

512
00:24:46,663 --> 00:24:47,452
我喜欢
I like it.

513
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:52,690
我想的…更多是顺着百万个吻在你的肌肤上的思路
I was thinking more along the lines of a million kisses on your skin.

514
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,594
你说什么，花栗鼠？
I beg your pardon, chimpmunk?

515
00:24:54,637 --> 00:24:58,832
毛伊岛上，有一些天然滑梯
On Maui they have these natural slides

516
00:24:58,923 --> 00:25:01,924
由火山喷发的黑曜石形成
formed from these volcanic eruptions of obsidian

517
00:25:01,937 --> 00:25:03,184
你爬上去
and you go climbing up

518
00:25:03,228 --> 00:25:05,308
然后你滑下一百英尺
and then you go sliding down a hundred feet

519
00:25:05,322 --> 00:25:07,533
进入他们所谓的七圣池
into what they call the Seven Sacred Pools.

520
00:25:08,126 --> 00:25:09,939
那里的水充满二氧化碳气体
And the water is so aerated

521
00:25:09,983 --> 00:25:12,803
感觉就像是百万个吻在你的肌肤上
that it feels like a million kisses on your skin

522
00:25:12,847 --> 00:25:16,833
或者像一条巨大的舌头舔着你的全身
or like an enormous tongue just licking your entire body.

523
00:25:20,768 --> 00:25:23,362
迪恩，你还记得我们谈过资金的事吗？
Dean, do you remember we were talking about the funding?

524
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,885
黑曜石滑梯和巨大的舔舌？
Obsidian slides and great licking tongues?

525
00:25:26,918 --> 00:25:29,803
我的天，他是整个部门的头头
My god, he's the head of the whole department.

526
00:25:31,608 --> 00:25:32,888
- 詹姆斯？  - 嗯？
- James? - Hmm?

527
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:35,770
你喜欢百万个吻在你的肌肤上吗？
How would you like a million kisses on your skin?

528
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:36,727
什么？
What?

529
00:25:37,001 --> 00:25:40,421
我们进行自己的原始仪式怎样？就在这里
What if we have our own primitive ritual right here.

530
00:25:40,814 --> 00:25:42,050
你疯了吗？
Have you gone mad?!

531
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:43,686
你在干什么？
What are you doing?!

532
00:25:50,432 --> 00:25:52,086
你不爱我
You don't love me.

533
00:25:52,529 --> 00:25:56,302
什么，就因为我不愿意在晚宴当中跟你做爱？
What, because I won't make love to you in the middle of some dinner party?

534
00:25:57,012 --> 00:25:59,006
凯瑟琳，你怎么能说这种话？
Catherine, how can you say such a thing?

535
00:25:59,243 --> 00:26:01,032
你知道我爱你超过一切
You know I love you more than anything.

536
00:26:01,525 --> 00:26:03,532
你是我的小鼠花栗，不是吗？
You're my little munchkin, aren't you?

537
00:26:03,756 --> 00:26:05,303
我不知道，詹姆斯，我是吗？
I don't know, James. Am I?

538
00:26:05,426 --> 00:26:06,527
你当然是啦
But of course you are.

539
00:26:06,643 --> 00:26:08,851
我的小小小鼠花栗
My little munchy munchkin.

540

你看
Look

541
00:26:10,355 --> 00:26:12,527
我本打算晚点再告诉你的
I wasn't going to tell you this till later

542
00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:14,144
不过你记得我跟你说过的那个惊喜吗？
but you remember that surprise I told you about?

543
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:14,910
不
No.

544
00:26:14,952 --> 00:26:16,327
那些卡片，那些颜色卡片
The cards. The color cards.

545
00:26:16,371 --> 00:26:17,324
对
Yes.

546
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:19,766
好了，等我们度完蜜月回家
Well, when we come home from our honeymoon

547
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:22,116
我们会有一个家可以回
we're going to have a home to come home to.

548
00:26:22,433 --> 00:26:24,335
在斯坦福

正教授，应用心理学系，还有…
Full professor. Department of Applied Psychology. And...

550
00:26:29,902 --> 00:26:32,625
随之而来的是我们自己的小鼠花栗窝
...it comes with its own little munchkin nest.

551
00:26:32,881 --> 00:26:34,860
而且你已经挑选了颜色
And you already picked out the color.

552
00:26:36,351 --> 00:26:37,144
藻绿
Algae.

553
00:26:37,922 --> 00:26:39,481
这是个颜色？
This is a color?

554
00:26:40,525 --> 00:26:42,450
而且还有足够的房间给孩子们
And there'll be plenty of room for the children.

555
00:26:42,953 --> 00:26:43,686
孩子们
Children...

556
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,238
詹姆斯说让他们之间隔三年半
James says that spacing them three and a half years apart

557
00:26:46,257 --> 00:26:48,316
对他们的心智发展是最理想的
is optimal for their mental development.

558
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:50,971
可你的心智发展怎么办？
But what about your mental development?

559
00:26:51,514 --> 00:26:52,238
什么？
What?

560
00:26:52,681 --> 00:26:54,449
你的研究

563
00:26:59,275 --> 00:27:01,634

凯瑟琳

00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:08,815
你父亲请求我照顾你的时候

566
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:10,734
我试过告诉他

567
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:16,800
我所知道的东西在现实世界里不太有用

568
00:27:17,701 --> 00:27:20,547
这就是为什么我很幸运有詹姆斯
And that's why I'm so lucky that I have James.

569

00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:34,214
对，可爱情呢，凯瑟琳？
Yeah, but what about love, Catherine?

574
00:27:35,494 --> 00:27:36,500
什么？

00:27:36,623 --> 00:27:39,225
我说这一切何时发生…
I said when does this all happen--

576

599
00:28:51,964 --> 00:28:53,746
不然你怎么拿到驾照？
How else could you get a license?

600

你今天是怎么回事，阿尔伯特？
What is wrong with you today, Albert?

604

凯瑟琳…
Catherine--

605
00:29:06,367 --> 00:29:08,543
她应该多找些乐子
she should be having more fun.

606
00:29:08,857 --> 00:29:10,731
她需要的是一个年轻人
What she needs is a young man.

607
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:13,914
她应该出去，去跳舞…
She should go out, go dancing...

608
00:29:13,957 --> 00:29:15,711
来点“schtupping”{\fs12} [性爱]{\r}
A little schtupping.

内森，拜托
Nathan, please.

611
00:29:18,452 --> 00:29:21,628
她以为“schtupping”是巴伐利亚的一个镇子呢
PODOLSKY: She thinks schtupping is a town in Bavaria.

612
00:29:23,353 --> 00:29:25,350
你带我们去哪里，阿尔伯特？
Where are you taking us, Albert?

613
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:29,830
哦，小伙子们，你们喜欢来一辆敞篷车吗？
Well, boys, how would you like to have a convertible?

614
00:29:31,622 --> 00:29:32,912

哦，漂亮

617
00:30:01,326 --> 00:30:02,362
先生？

618
00:30:04,324 --> 00:30:06,688
这装潢很漂亮
It's very nice upholstery.

619
00:30:06,832 --> 00:30:08,647
你是阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦
You're Albert Einstein.

620
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,824
E = mc²
E = mc squared.

621
00:30:12,367 --> 00:30:14,140
我希望如此
I hope so.

622
00:30:15,003 --> 00:30:17,774
告诉我，这车从工厂里出来就是这样子？
Tell me, this comes from the factory like this?

623
00:30:17,807 --> 00:30:19,494
哦，不不不，全是订做的
Oh, no, no. It's all custom.

624
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:21,312
我不敢相信…在我的修车厂
I can't believe it--in my garage.

625
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,425
这可真是荣幸
This is a real honor.

626
00:30:22,469 --> 00:30:24,615
弗兰基，这是爱因斯坦教授
Frankie, this is Professor Einstein,

627
00:30:24,648 --> 00:30:26,534
世界上最聪明的人
the smartest person in the world.

628
00:30:26,807 --> 00:30:28,232
他们怎么样了？
How they hanging?

629
00:30:31,156 --> 00:30:32,235
爱德华！
Edward!

630
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:33,124
嘿，博士
Hey, doc.

631
00:30:33,148 --> 00:30:34,373
爱德华
Edward.

632
00:30:35,216 --> 00:30:36,370
它在那里
There it is.

633
00:30:36,813 --> 00:30:38,632
你怎么想？有可能吗？
What do you think? Is it possible?

634
00:30:39,034 --> 00:30:40,226
当然，任何事都有可能
Sure. Anything's possible.

635
00:30:40,269 --> 00:30:41,837
他想把那车变成这个…

636
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:42,876
敞篷车

637
00:30:43,511 --> 00:30:44,235
没问题
No problem.

638
00:30:44,268 --> 00:30:46,641
你是说全面护理吗，教授？
You were talking about the full treatment, Professor?

639
00:30:46,685 --> 00:30:48,648
对对{\fs12} [德语]{\r}，从头到尾
Ja, ja. The whole ball of wax.

640
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,646
波多尔斯基，住手
Podolsky, stop that.

641
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:53,648
好的，那么我们把顶部切掉
Okay, so we chop the top,

642
00:30:53,892 --> 00:30:55,650
做一个改进的机头和装甲…

643
00:30:55,964 --> 00:30:56,956
填充起来

645
00:30:59,214 --> 00:31:00,220
前面用达格材料？
Dago the front?

646
00:31:00,263 --> 00:31:01,469
就要一点
Just a touch.

647
00:31:01,612 --> 00:31:03,023
- 引擎四套件管  - 对
- Quad barrels for the mill. - Yeah.

648
00:31:03,066 --> 00:31:04,337
大师工具箱

00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,426

00:31:10,796 --> 00:31:12,232
像是莫扎特
Like Mozart.

654
00:31:12,975 --> 00:31:16,569
你看，我记得这里有一家冰淇淋商店
You know, I recall here someplace is an ice cream parlor.

655
00:31:16,602 --> 00:31:18,238
来吧，我们买一个去

656
00:31:18,281 --> 00:31:19,892
博士，其实，是这边

657
00:31:19,935 --> 00:31:20,951
- 哦，对  - 可以吗？

660
00:31:23,169 --> 00:31:25,024
- 当然  - 当然
- Sure. - Sure.

661
00:31:30,109 --> 00:31:33,456
我1933年第一次到这里的时候
When I first arrived here in 1933,

662
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,100
我去买了一个这种三球冰淇淋
I went and bought one of these triple scoops.

663
00:31:37,144 --> 00:31:38,280
什么口味的？
What flavor?

664
00:31:38,824 --> 00:31:40,424
薄荷

665
00:31:40,758 --> 00:31:41,320
你看
You see?

666
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,306
这是个好问题
This is a good question.

667
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,680
“什么口味的”
"What flavor?"

668
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:48,534
简单，具体，而且有一个答案
Simple, specific, and it has an answer.

669
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,271
你读了好多科幻小说
You read a lot of science fiction.

670
00:31:51,714 --> 00:31:54,189
告诉我，你认为他们究竟会不会…
Tell me, do you think they'll ever find...

671
00:31:54,814 --> 00:31:58,189
…在宇宙某处找到智慧生命？
...intelligent life anywhere in the universe?

672
00:31:58,952 --> 00:32:01,802
他们仍然在地球这里寻找智慧生命呢
They're still looking for intelligent life here on Earth.

673
00:32:06,142 --> 00:32:09,285
你看，凯瑟琳…她是个有才华的数学家
You know, Catherine-- she's a brilliant mathematician

674
00:32:09,328 --> 00:32:11,220
但她缺乏自信
but she lacks confidence.

675
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:13,672
她认为她对世界的贡献…
She thinks her contribution to the world...

676
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:15,272
…将通过她的孩子达成
...will be through her children.

677
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,728
她有一个发疯的想法
She has this crazy idea

678
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:22,171
如果她嫁给一个知识分子
that if she marries an intellectual

679
00:32:23,615 --> 00:32:27,235
她就会生下天才儿童等等之类
she will have genius children or something like that.

680
00:32:28,003 --> 00:32:29,933
凯瑟琳，她太聪明了不该那样
Catherine-- she's too smart for that.

681
00:32:30,006 --> 00:32:31,634
哦，她这里太聪明
Oh, she's too smart here.

682
00:32:32,578 --> 00:32:33,727
但不是这里
But not here.

683
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:38,146
她需要的是跟你这样的人出去
What she needs is to go out with someone like you.

684
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,180
问题在于
The problem is

685
00:32:40,823 --> 00:32:43,443
她永远也不会跟你这样的人出去
she would never go out with someone like you.

686
00:32:43,742 --> 00:32:44,428
这个容易
That's easy.

687
00:32:44,431 --> 00:32:46,752
只要把你的大脑借给我几天
Just lend me your brain for a couple of days.

688
00:32:50,717 --> 00:32:51,722
什么？
What?

689
00:32:52,266 --> 00:32:54,770
你跟我想的是一回事吗？
Are you thinking what I am thinking?

690
00:32:56,514 --> 00:32:58,555
这个发生的机会有多大？
What would be the odds of that happening?

691
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,241
还是不对
It's still not right.

692
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:08,060
什么？
What?

693
00:33:08,103 --> 00:33:10,201
他看来不像是个科学家
He doesn't look like a scientist.

694
00:33:10,344 --> 00:33:11,917
那么，再说说计划是怎样的，博士？
So, what's the plan again, doc?

695
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,920
给，试试这个
Here, try this.

696
00:33:13,983 --> 00:33:16,312
计划是我们谈论科学
The plan is we talk science.

697
00:33:16,356 --> 00:33:18,166
我们弄些东西吃
So we have something to eat.

698
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,854
我们喝点杜松子酒
We drink some schnapps.

699
00:33:19,888 --> 00:33:21,451
我们谈谈人生
And we talk about life.

700
00:33:21,524 --> 00:33:23,537
我认为这样太时髦了
I think it's too fashionable.

701
00:33:23,541 --> 00:33:24,146
对对
Yeah, yeah.

702
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:24,949
来…
Here--

845
00:40:02,675 --> 00:40:03,698
艾德
Ed.

846
00:40:16,435 --> 00:40:17,429
{\i1}不不
No, no

847
00:40:17,472 --> 00:40:21,259
{\i1}是P方除以N，不是N方除以P
it's P squared over N, not N squared over P.

848
00:40:24,502 --> 00:40:25,752
{\i1}她都不在这里
She's not even here.

849
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:28,875
{\i1}要是她嫁给一个天才，她会生个天才儿童
If she marries a genius, she'll have genius children.

850
00:40:29,018 --> 00:40:30,572
做点什么
Do something.

851
00:40:31,816 --> 00:40:34,844
我是在做点什么，可是没有帮助
I am doing something, but it's not helpful.

852
00:40:34,984 --> 00:40:36,056
也不愉快
Or pleasant.

853
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:39,233
{\i1}一种核动力空间飞船
A nuclear-powered spacecraft.

854
00:40:39,677 --> 00:40:41,540
出类拔萃的同行们…
Distinguished colleagues...

855
00:40:43,106 --> 00:40:44,804
嘉宾们…
honored guests...

856
00:40:44,847 --> 00:40:50,328
{\i1}爱德华，记住你为什么要做这件事
Edward, just remember why you are doing this.

857
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:00,394
生活中的任何旅程…
Any journey in life...

858
00:41:01,537 --> 00:41:05,738
如果不是出于人类的原因，带着理解和爱…
if not done for human reasons, with understanding and love...

859
00:41:05,781 --> 00:41:07,566
这不是我们写的论文
This is not the paper we wrote.

860
00:41:08,009 --> 00:41:08,763
嘘
Shh!

861
00:41:08,777 --> 00:41:10,779
- …就会非常空洞和孤单  - 听
- ... would be a very empty and lonely one. - Listen.

862
00:41:11,222 --> 00:41:13,111
看看
And look.

863
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
有些东西值得记住，因为…
Something worth remembering, since...

864
00:41:18,303 --> 00:41:21,000
核动力飞船也许很快就能…
...nuclear-powered spacecraft may soon

865
00:41:21,907 --> 00:41:27,390
…让旅行至宇宙边缘再返回的古老梦想…
make the ancient dream of traveling to the edge of the universe and back...

866
00:41:28,224 --> 00:41:29,544
…成为现实
a reality.

867
00:41:31,458 --> 00:41:33,419
那种动力的来源
The source of that power

868
00:41:34,642 --> 00:41:38,201
就是恒星的燃料来源其本身，而且…
is the very source that fuels the stars themselves and...

869
00:41:38,435 --> 00:41:39,381
这样做…
in doing so...

870
00:41:40,445 --> 00:41:44,751
给我们的想象力和梦想加注了燃料
…fuels our imagination and our dreams.

871
00:41:45,809 --> 00:41:47,241
让我们假设…
Let us suppose

872
00:41:48,384 --> 00:41:53,871
V (X)是穿透潜能的标准界限
that V of X is the standard barrier of penetration potential

873
00:41:54,824 --> 00:41:59,283
还有其尺寸以及原子核函数
and that size... and nuclear ...function...

874
00:42:00,227 --> 00:42:06,929
然后按照常规，减去I-H-R-D sin（D-T）等于
then, as usual, minus I-H-R-D sine D-T equals

875
00:42:07,973 --> 00:42:09,932
减掉D平方
minus D squared

876
00:42:10,976 --> 00:42:13,412
ψ（D-X）平方
psi D-X squared

877
00:42:13,862 --> 00:42:15,307
加上V (X)
plus V of X.

878
00:42:16,862 --> 00:42:19,307
- 精彩  - 精彩
- Bravo. - Bravo.

879
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:21,640
真是个马戏团
What a circus!

880
00:42:21,863 --> 00:42:24,251
好像科学分析还不够让人麻木似的
As if the scientific analysis wasn't mind-numbing enough

881
00:42:24,294 --> 00:42:26,558
那些有关人类心灵的伤感话语是在搞什么？
what was all that mush about the human heart?

882
00:42:26,801 --> 00:42:29,561
你不懂是因为你不是物理学家
You didn't understand that because you're not a physicist.

883
00:42:29,604 --> 00:42:30,412
对，不过我们要记住，亲
Yeah, well, let's remember, darling,

884
00:42:30,431 --> 00:42:32,238
直到最近之前他也不是
neither was he until recently.

885
00:42:32,481 --> 00:42:34,835
你有没有注意到他指甲里还有润滑油？
Did you notice he still had grease under his fingernails?

886
00:42:35,141 --> 00:42:36,903
爱德华，恭喜
Edward, congratulations.

887
00:42:37,241 --> 00:42:38,565
敬天才
To genius.

888
00:42:38,748 --> 00:42:40,136
敬核聚变
To fusion.

889
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,660
敬心灵
To the heart.

890
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,403
啊，哦，所以你从未上过大学
Ah, oh, so you never went to college.

891
00:42:45,846 --> 00:42:47,387
我几乎没读完高中
I barely finished high school.

892
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:49,383
我一直在拆解车子
I was always taking apart some car.

893
00:42:49,407 --> 00:42:52,305
然而，你对理论的把握如此惊人
And yet, you have such an amazing grasp of theory.

894
00:42:52,348 --> 00:42:55,608
你知道吗，我相信你用了德布罗利公式
Do you know, I believe that you used Debrawley's formula

895
00:42:55,651 --> 00:42:56,936
来计算导波的长度
for the length of the pilot wave.

896
00:42:56,979 --> 00:42:58,024
他当然如此啦
Of course he did.

897
00:42:58,067 --> 00:43:00,287
这是出色的一着
It was a brilliant stroke.

898
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:01,767
没有它我做不到
I couldn't have done without it.

899
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:03,899
哦！我都忘了
Oh! I forgot that.

900
00:43:04,043 --> 00:43:06,474
等一下你可否，可否提醒我一下
Wait a minute. Could you, could you remind me?

901
00:43:08,421 --> 00:43:10,428
好，嗯，当然
Yeah. Um, sure.

902
00:43:12,125 --> 00:43:14,170
X
X

903
00:43:12,847 --> 00:43:19,715
{\a6}（这个公式是杜撰的，大概是以德布罗意为原型）

904
00:43:14,514 --> 00:43:15,458
等于…
equals...

905
00:43:16,546 --> 00:43:17,565
1
one

906
00:43:17,609 --> 00:43:18,827
加，呃…
plus, uh...

907
00:43:20,002 --> 00:43:21,003
W
W...

908
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:25,621
X等于1加W
X equals one plus W

909
00:43:25,665 --> 00:43:26,835
立方
cubed...

910
00:43:30,212 --> 00:43:31,493
除
in...

911
00:43:32,537 --> 00:43:34,103
除以Π
over pi.

912
00:43:35,447 --> 00:43:36,715
对对
Right, right.

913
00:43:36,758 --> 00:43:37,759
你能发明它吗？
Can you invert that?

914
00:43:39,874 --> 00:43:40,980
他在哪里？
Where is he?!

915
00:43:41,423 --> 00:43:42,895
那个美少年在哪里？
Where is that beautiful boy?

916
00:43:43,438 --> 00:43:44,113
火箭飞船
Rocket ships.

917
00:43:46,502 --> 00:43:48,248
本垒打，凯瑟琳，本垒打！
Home run, Catherine, home run!

918
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:49,310
谢谢你，先生
Thank you, sir.

919
00:43:49,354 --> 00:43:52,178
艾德·沃尔特斯，允许我介绍路易斯·班伯格
Ed Walters, may I present Louis Bamberger?

920
00:43:52,221 --> 00:43:54,916
如果他每有一分钱你就有一分钱
If you had a nickel for every nickel he has,

921
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,321
你就会有好多好多钱
you would have a lot of nickels.

922
00:43:58,414 --> 00:44:01,053
荣而又幸，先生
An honor and a pleasure, sir.

923
00:44:01,421 --> 00:44:02,623
新泽西…
New Jersey--

924
00:44:03,006 --> 00:44:05,700
星系间火箭探索的领导者
leader in intergalactic rocket exploration.

925
00:44:06,044 --> 00:44:08,007
这个车牌听起来怎么样？
How does that sound for a license plate?

926
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:09,227
长
Long.

927
00:44:11,342 --> 00:44:12,414
幽默感
sense of humor.

928
00:44:12,498 --> 00:44:13,558
我爱这个小伙子
I love this boy.

929
00:44:13,772 --> 00:44:16,922
我能把我外甥女偷走一会儿吗，劳驾？
May I steal my niece for one minute, please?

930
00:44:18,986 --> 00:44:19,061
哦，其实我们正要走
Uh, well, actually, we were just about to leave.

931
00:44:19,105 --> 00:44:20,737
就一会儿，拜托
Just for one moment, please.

932
00:44:20,781 --> 00:44:22,543
- 我需要点空气  - 哦…
- I need some air. - Well...

933
00:44:22,587 --> 00:44:25,546
詹姆斯，老鼠业务怎么一样了？
James, how is the rat business?

934
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:28,783
呣，这个，我现在的实验对象其实是学生
Um, well, it's really students that I'm experimenting on now.

935
00:44:28,805 --> 00:44:31,534
我的天，那些迷宫一定很大
My god, the mazes must be enormous.

936
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:36,352
绿色，黑色，红色
Green, black, red.

937
00:44:36,736 --> 00:44:37,458
看看
Look at that.

938
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:39,255
这就像是一次有了四支笔
It's like having four pens in one.

939
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:42,107
活在这个时代多么令人激动啊
What an exciting time to be alive.

940
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:45,370
路易斯，我们需要谈一谈
Louis, we need to have a talk.

941
00:44:45,713 --> 00:44:47,502
说的是我能理解的东西，对吗？
This is going to be something I understand, isn't it?

942
00:44:47,446 --> 00:44:49,758
- 对对  - 我是说我听不懂你跟我说的东西
- Yeah, yeah. - I mean I don't understand what you say to me.

943
00:44:49,788 --> 00:44:51,529
对，可是你看…
Yes, but you see...

944
00:44:54,973 --> 00:44:57,482
哦，这下好多了
Oh, that's better.

945
00:44:58,025 --> 00:44:59,371
看，凯瑟琳
Look, Catherine.

946
00:44:59,974 --> 00:45:03,058
看看星星，看看天空
Look at the stars, look at the sky

947
00:45:03,112 --> 00:45:04,106
看看…
look at...

948
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:05,704
爱德华
Edward.

949
00:45:05,747 --> 00:45:08,929
我们刚才正在谈论星星
We were just talking about the stars.

950
00:45:09,372 --> 00:45:11,805
啊…好了，呼吸够了
Ah... well, enough breathing.

951
00:45:14,862 --> 00:45:16,123
多好的晚上
What a night.

952
00:45:16,266 --> 00:45:18,904
从孩提时以来我就再没见过这样的天空
I haven't see a sky like this since I was a kid.

953
00:45:19,247 --> 00:45:21,254
那是天文学家的领域
That's stargazers' field.

954
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,543
你觉得上面有多少颗星星？
How many stars do you think are up there?

955
00:45:24,649 --> 00:45:27,140
呃，10的12次方，加1
Um, ten to the twelfth, plus one.

956
00:45:28,403 --> 00:45:29,436
你不必那样说
you don't have to say that.

957
00:45:29,479 --> 00:45:31,699
不，真的，人人都很佩服你
No, really, everybody is quite impressed.

958
00:45:36,512 --> 00:45:39,947
你知道为什么彗尾总是远离太阳那面吗？
Do you know why a comet's tail always points away from the sun?

959
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:41,056
知道
Yes.

960
00:45:42,807 --> 00:45:43,885
我也知道
Me, too.

961
00:45:45,945 --> 00:45:47,454
我的奶奶曾经告诉我
My grandma used to tell me that

962
00:45:47,947 --> 00:45:52,153
星星是啄木鸟在天空中啄洞的地方
stars are where a woodpecker pecked holes in the sky.

963
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:54,908
她没有那么多科学头脑
She wasn't that scientifically minded.

964
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:57,920
当我父亲仰望天空时，他并没有真正看到星星
When my father looked at the sky he didn't really see stars.

965
00:45:57,956 --> 00:45:59,640
他说他看见…
He said he saw

966
00:45:59,684 --> 00:46:03,684
巨大的火海和核熔炉
great seas of fire and nuclear furnaces.

967
00:46:03,718 --> 00:46:06,873
他说那就像一场非常暴力的芭蕾舞
He said it was like a very violent ballet

968
00:46:06,916 --> 00:46:09,084
只不过它太小了，谁也看不见
only it was too small for anyone to see.

969
00:46:12,827 --> 00:46:15,364
什么事把詹姆斯给耽搁了？
What is keeping James?

970
00:46:15,508 --> 00:46:16,744
我不知道
I don't know.

971
00:46:17,288 --> 00:46:19,294
他发现了一颗彗星
He discovered a comet.

972
00:46:19,438 --> 00:46:20,243
詹姆斯发现了一颗…？
James discovered a...?

973
00:46:20,287 --> 00:46:21,400
不，我父亲
No. My father.

974
00:46:21,413 --> 00:46:23,251
他们以他的名字给它命名
They named it after him.

975
00:46:24,529 --> 00:46:25,330
博伊德彗星
Boyd's comet.

976
00:46:25,344 --> 00:46:25,901
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

977
00:46:25,945 --> 00:46:27,100
哦，我的天，那是你
Oh, my god, that's you.

978
00:46:27,124 --> 00:46:28,756
那是你父亲
That's your father.

979
00:46:28,904 --> 00:46:29,656
我…
I...

980
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,030
我刚刚读到那些，在那本…
I was just reading about that in the...

981
00:46:32,225 --> 00:46:34,209
哦，你读过他的著作？
Oh, you've read his works?

982
00:46:34,953 --> 00:46:36,758
哦，一部分吧，那么多本呢
Well, some of them. There are so many.

983
00:46:36,857 --> 00:46:37,539
三本
Three.

984
00:46:38,303 --> 00:46:40,000
三本？真的吗？那个…
Three? Really? There...

985
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,439
感觉好像要多些
it seemed like more.

986
00:46:42,022 --> 00:46:43,597
它们都内容丰富
They're all so action-packed.

987
00:46:48,531 --> 00:46:50,312
内容丰富？
Action-packed?

988
00:46:50,656 --> 00:46:51,910
他在说什么？
What is he saying?

989
00:46:53,634 --> 00:46:55,030
他回来了
He's coming back.

990
00:46:55,344 --> 00:46:56,131
詹姆斯？
James?

991
00:46:56,215 --> 00:46:56,981
不是
No.

992
00:46:57,955 --> 00:46:59,281
呃，我父亲
Uh, my father.

993
00:46:59,352 --> 00:47:01,009
你看，他临死前保证说…
You know, just before he died he promised that...

994
00:47:01,053 --> 00:47:03,660
当那颗彗星回来的时候，他会骑在上面
when the comet came back he'd be riding on it.

995
00:47:04,457 --> 00:47:06,141
就在，呃…
Right, uh....

996
00:47:06,785 --> 00:47:08,446
就在那边
right there.

997
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,278
我认为是在那边，就在仙后座的下方
I think it's there, just below Cassiopeia.

998
00:47:14,032 --> 00:47:15,368
啊，你说得对
Ah, you're right.

999
00:47:16,761 --> 00:47:17,715
他说过他会…
He said he'd be...

1000
00:47:18,481 --> 00:47:22,115
…骑在上面俯视下方，确保我没事
...riding on it looking down to make sure I was okay.

1001
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:24,419
那么你怎么样？还好吗？
So, how are you? Are you okay?

1002
00:47:24,936 --> 00:47:26,596
{\i1}凯瑟琳？
Catherine?

1003
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,403
凯瑟琳
Catherine!

1004
00:47:28,457 --> 00:47:30,131
老鼠男来啦
The rat man cometh.

1005
00:47:31,175 --> 00:47:31,819
我…
I...

1006
00:47:32,263 --> 00:47:33,560
凯瑟琳？
Catherine?

1007
00:47:34,909 --> 00:47:36,606
谁去叫医生
Somebody call a doctor.

1008
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:38,147
阿尔伯特，说句话啊
Albert, say something.

1009
00:47:38,191 --> 00:47:42,297
我只是午餐吃了太多knerdler
I just had too many knerdlers for lunch.

1010
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:44,238
我需要我的药
I need my pills.

1011
00:47:44,252 --> 00:47:45,830
凯瑟琳，你知道在哪里吧？
Catherine, you know where they are?

1012
00:47:45,842 --> 00:47:46,569
在家里
At home.

1013
00:47:46,574 --> 00:47:47,343
- 我们走  - 好
- Let's go. - Ya.

1014
00:47:47,473 --> 00:47:48,706
爱德华，你开车载我
Edward, you drive me.

1015
00:47:49,936 --> 00:47:52,148
对，好的，你…你开车载他回家
Yes, all right, you-you drive him home.

1016
00:47:52,792 --> 00:47:54,450
我来收拾你的东西，凯瑟琳
I'll collect your things, Catherine,

1017
00:47:54,894 --> 00:47:57,358
回头我在“每日咖啡杯”跟你见面
and I'll see you at the Cafe Day Cup later.

1018
00:47:57,361 --> 00:47:58,030
好的 好的
Yes. Yes.

1019
00:47:58,132 --> 00:47:59,365
好吗？
Yes?

1020
00:48:00,108 --> 00:48:03,633
阿尔伯特，你要我们跟你来吗？
Albert, you want us to come with you?

1021
00:48:03,677 --> 00:48:04,939
不不
No, no.

1022
00:48:04,983 --> 00:48:06,288
当心
Watch out.

1023
00:48:06,732 --> 00:48:08,073
再见，拜托
Good-bye, please.

1024
00:48:08,116 --> 00:48:09,857
我们走，我们走
Let's go. Let's go.

1025
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,428
等一下
Wait a minute.

1026
00:48:16,121 --> 00:48:17,778
我们怎么回家？
How do we get home?

1027
00:48:17,982 --> 00:48:19,258
好问题
Good question.

1028
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,783
这是个美好的晚上
it's a lovely night.

1029
00:48:23,327 --> 00:48:24,437
我们走路
We walk.

1030
00:48:36,022 --> 00:48:39,030
哦，看，我找到我的药了
Oh, look, I found my pills.

1031
00:48:39,973 --> 00:48:44,631
现在…也许我们可以弄个玻璃杯放进去
Now... maybe we can catch some of this in a glass.

1032
00:48:45,024 --> 00:48:46,633
应该让你下车
Should get you out of this.

1033
00:48:46,676 --> 00:48:48,809
对，是个好主意
Yeah, that's a good idea.

1034
00:48:49,033 --> 00:48:50,332
那边
Over there.

1035
00:48:50,936 --> 00:48:52,595
那家咖啡馆，爱德华
That cafe, Edward.

1036
00:49:01,854 --> 00:49:06,234
对，这是个…很糟糕的阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦笑话
Yeah, it's a... very bad Albert Einstein joke.

1037
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,994
玛丽瓦是他的第一个妻子
Maleva was his first wife.

1038
00:49:09,028 --> 00:49:10,017
她跟他离了婚
She divorced him.

1039
00:49:10,231 --> 00:49:12,715
对，我生活在这里太多，这里不够多
Yeah, I lived too much here and not enough here.

1040
00:49:12,965 --> 00:49:13,777
她有孩子吗？
She have children?

1041
00:49:13,831 --> 00:49:14,854
两个男孩
Two boys.

1042
00:49:14,904 --> 00:49:16,010
汉斯·阿尔伯特
Hans Albert.

1043
00:49:16,054 --> 00:49:19,202
我不在的时候他母亲给他起的名字
His mother named him while I was out of town.

1044
00:49:19,903 --> 00:49:21,189
还有爱德华
And Edward.

1045
00:49:22,033 --> 00:49:22,712
什么？
Yes?

1046
00:49:23,556 --> 00:49:26,028
不，爱德华是另一个男孩的名字
No. Edward was the name of the other boy.

1047
00:49:29,442 --> 00:49:32,000
那么，你一定在这里生活过至少两次
Well, you must have lived here at least twice.

1048
00:49:32,514 --> 00:49:33,889
爱德华…
Edward...

1049
00:49:34,433 --> 00:49:38,690
你一开始是怎么想到原子燃料的？
how did you first think of atomic fuel?

1050
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,341
哦，就好像是灵光一现
Well, it just sort of hit me.

1051
00:49:45,473 --> 00:49:48,347
是凯斯勒式的一闪还是个偶然？
Was it a Kessler boom or an accident?

1052
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:52,519
因为凯斯勒认为偶然的发现根本不是偶然
Because Kessler believes that accidental discoveries are not accidents at all.

1053
00:49:52,799 --> 00:49:55,958
人们会有顿悟和直觉的时刻
That people have moments of insight and intuition

1054
00:49:56,002 --> 00:49:59,796
他们已准备好靠他们的经验来认识自己的本来面目
that they're prepared for by their experience to recognize them for what they are.

1055
00:50:01,983 --> 00:50:03,275
唠叨
Babbling.

1056
00:50:03,531 --> 00:50:04,885
唠叨？
Babbling?

1057
00:50:06,222 --> 00:50:07,473
不，你没有唠叨
No, you're not babbling.

1058
00:50:07,982 --> 00:50:11,718
要是我有你这样的头脑，我不会停止说话
If I had a mind like yours, I wouldn't stop talking.

1059
00:50:15,691 --> 00:50:17,506
我觉得雨在减弱
I think it's letting up.

1060
00:50:25,627 --> 00:50:27,386
我觉得她想离开
I think she wants to leave.

1061
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:30,215
她不知道她想要什么
She doesn't know what she wants.

1062
00:50:44,944 --> 00:50:46,135
还在下雨
Still raining.

1063
00:50:46,579 --> 00:50:48,537
还在下雨
Still raining.

1064
00:51:27,619 --> 00:51:31,363
我想你舅舅想要我们…跳舞
I think your uncle wants us... to dance.

1065
00:51:31,906 --> 00:51:32,921
哦，好啦
Oh, now,

1066
00:51:33,365 --> 00:51:34,675
不要跑题了，艾德
don't be irrelevant, Ed.

1067
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:36,809
你不能从那里走到这里
You can't get from there to here.

1068
00:51:37,251 --> 00:51:38,157
为什么？
Why not?

1069
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,206
好了，可别告诉我…
Now, don't tell me that...

1070
00:51:40,349 --> 00:51:43,931
你这样一个著名的出色科学家
...a famous and brilliant scientist such as yourself

1071
00:51:43,984 --> 00:51:46,033
会不知道芝诺佯谬
doesn't know about Zeno's paradox.

1072
00:51:48,096 --> 00:51:48,946
提醒我一下
Remind me.

1073
00:51:48,989 --> 00:51:50,343
你不能从那边走到这边
You can't get from there to here

1074
00:51:50,366 --> 00:51:52,680
因为你总是要覆盖剩下的一半距离
because you always have to cover half the remaining distance.

1075
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:56,143
比如从我到你，我得走一半路
Like, from me to you, I have to cover half of it.

1076
00:51:56,736 --> 00:51:59,805
可是，看？我还有一半路要走，所以…
But, see? I still have half of that remaining, so...

1077
00:51:59,848 --> 00:52:02,698
我走一半的路，然后…
I cover half that and, um...

1078
00:52:02,742 --> 00:52:03,850
那就还有一半的路剩下
there's still half of that left

1079
00:52:03,873 --> 00:52:05,875
所以我又走一半的路
so I cover half of that

1080
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:09,096
然后，呃…一半的路
and, uh... half of that

1081
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:11,399
再一半，再一半
and half of that and half of that.

1082
00:52:11,443 --> 00:52:14,961
由于有无穷无尽的一半路剩下…
And since there are infinite halves left...

1083
00:52:16,886 --> 00:52:18,976
永远也不能到达
can't ever get there.

1084
00:52:31,953 --> 00:52:33,468
所以这是怎么发生的？
So how did that happen?

1085
00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:37,298
我不知道
I don't know.

1086
00:52:39,008 --> 00:52:40,736
这不可能
It's not possible.

1087
00:53:03,611 --> 00:53:04,469
詹姆斯
James.

1088
00:53:04,662 --> 00:53:05,544
不，是艾德
No. Ed.

1089
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,199
詹姆斯，我应该去跟他会合的
James. I was supposed to meet him.

1090
00:53:17,295 --> 00:53:20,080
走，走，走，走
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1091
00:53:22,777 --> 00:53:24,032
我们要不要再来？
Shall we go again?

1092
00:53:28,523 --> 00:53:32,136
所以我们有粒子“C”凯瑟琳
So we have particle "C"-- Catherine--

1093
00:53:32,739 --> 00:53:36,588
在粒子“J”詹姆斯的轨道上
in orbit around particle "J"-- James--

1094
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:40,492
激发粒子“E”爱德华
powerize particle "E"-- Edward--

1095
00:53:40,535 --> 00:53:44,931
跟着“C”，变成一个新的实体
follows "C", becomes a new entity.

1096
00:53:45,104 --> 00:53:47,542
“C”加“E”
"C" plus "E"

1097
00:53:47,658 --> 00:53:50,658
这就导致“J”的衰变
which causes "J" to disintegrate.

What if you question everything?

1259
01:03:54,985 --> 01:03:55,894
看看它
Look at it

1260
01:03:55,947 --> 01:03:58,892
从一个完全不同的角度
from an entirely different perspective.

1261
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:01,025
质疑一切
Question everything.

1262
01:04:16,863 --> 01:04:17,838
阿尔伯特舅舅…
Uncle Albert...

1263
01:04:18,982 --> 01:04:20,366
这个可能是对的吗？
could this be right?

1264
01:04:25,610 --> 01:04:26,572
怎么啦？
What?

1265
01:04:26,815 --> 01:04:28,443
我知道这种表情，我做错什么了？
I know that look. What did I do?

1266
01:04:28,987 --> 01:04:31,838
我从没用这种方式检视过它
I never saw it this way.

1267
01:04:36,273 --> 01:04:37,975
我不知道我刚才在想什么
I don't know what I was thinking.

1268
01:04:42,975 --> 01:04:44,220
失陪
Excuse me.

1269
01:04:51,645 --> 01:04:52,877
你对她说什么了？
What did you say to her?

1270
01:05:01,933 --> 01:05:04,337
你为什么要让他们把你吓成这样？
Why do you let them scare you off like that?

1271
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,833
他们是世界上最厉害的头脑
They are the greatest minds in the world.

1272
01:05:06,866 --> 01:05:09,046
又怎样？谁说他们无所不知？
So? Who says they have all the answers?

1273
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:10,677
等等，谁说什么话了？
Wait. Who says what?

1274
01:05:11,221 --> 01:05:13,739
谁说你不是世界上最厉害的头脑之一？
Who says you're not one of the greatest minds in the world?

1275
01:05:13,971 --> 01:05:15,503
哦，我可不像你
Well, I'm not like you.

1276
01:05:15,547 --> 01:05:16,491
你是天生的
You're a natural.

1277
01:05:16,535 --> 01:05:18,189
你…你就像是他们中的一员
You're just like one of them.

1278
01:05:18,632 --> 01:05:20,028
- 不，我不是  - 是的，你是
- No, I'm not. - Yes, you are.

1279
01:05:20,112 --> 01:05:21,088
- 不，我不是  - 是的，你是
- No, I'm not. - Yes, you are.

1280
01:05:21,171 --> 01:05:22,193
相信我，我不是
Believe me, I'm not.

1281
01:05:22,336 --> 01:05:24,245
哦，对…你更年轻
Oh! Well, okay-- you're younger.

1282
01:05:24,568 --> 01:05:25,562
重点在于
The point is,

1283
01:05:25,605 --> 01:05:27,968
你不只是什么傻傻的汽车机修工
you're not just some dumb garage mechanic.

1284
01:05:28,031 --> 01:05:29,695
你是个天才，而我只是…
You're a genius, and I'm just...

1285
01:05:29,728 --> 01:05:30,340
我不知道我是什么
I don't know what I am.

1286
01:05:30,354 --> 01:05:31,216
什么？你是什么？
What? What are you?

1287
01:05:31,853 --> 01:05:32,817
一个家庭主妇？
A housewife?

1288
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:35,850
几乎是吧
Almost.

1289
01:05:35,924 --> 01:05:38,231
我认为你不止如此
I think you're more than that.

1290
01:05:38,985 --> 01:05:43,170
[ 模仿白兰度 ]：女士，你唯一害怕的就是你自己
[ imitating Brando]: Lady, the only thing you're afraid of is yourself.

1291
01:05:44,714 --> 01:05:46,192
等等，我能不能问你一件事？
Wait. Can I just ask you something?

1292
01:05:46,216 --> 01:05:46,973
什么？
What?

1293
01:05:47,117 --> 01:05:48,006
是什么，呃…
What, um...

1294
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:49,507
你为什么那么做？
Why do you do that?

1295
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:50,730
什么？
What?

1296
01:05:50,684 --> 01:05:52,110
白兰度
Brando.

1297
01:05:54,253 --> 01:05:55,656
我只是想逗你笑
I'm just trying to make you smile.

1298
01:05:56,544 --> 01:05:57,663
那么…
Well...

1299
01:05:58,266 --> 01:05:59,099
谢谢
Thanks.

1300
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:00,797
再见
Bye.

1301
01:06:03,721 --> 01:06:05,237
这样最好
It's for the best.

1302
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:09,478
我们稍微挤压一下大脑，给心灵腾出空间
We squeeze the brain a little to make room for the heart.

1303
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:14,872
又或许偶然是大设计的一部分？
Or maybe accidents are part of the grand design?

1304
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:18,640
如果你导致了偶然，那它就不是偶然了
If you cause the accident then it is not an accident.

1305
01:06:19,159 --> 01:06:20,372
啊，对对
Ah, ja, ja.

1306
01:06:20,416 --> 01:06:24,513
你知道，偶然的问题在于你不能预测其结果
You know, the trouble with accidents is you can't predict the outcome.

1307
01:06:24,736 --> 01:06:29,324
啊，所以说也许凯瑟琳会爱上我们中的一个
Ah! So-So maybe Catherine will fall in love with one of us.

1308
01:06:30,782 --> 01:06:32,654
你真是个梦想家，李卜克内西
You are such a dreamer, Liebitzrecht.

1309
01:06:45,850 --> 01:06:48,926
哦，哦，真抱歉，你在睡觉吗？
Oh! Oh, I'm sorry. Were you sleeping?

1310
01:06:49,246 --> 01:06:50,468
哦，凯瑟琳，没有
Oh, Catherine, no.

1311
01:06:51,111 --> 01:06:52,632
我只是在休憩
I was just in repose.

1312
01:06:53,731 --> 01:06:54,920
你去哪儿啦？
Where were you?

1313
01:06:55,263 --> 01:06:55,956
在思考
Thinking.

1314
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,382
我在担心你
I was worried about you.

1315
01:06:58,416 --> 01:07:00,000
担心我思考？
That I was thinking?

1316
01:07:00,161 --> 01:07:01,170
我也是
Me, too.

1317
01:07:02,114 --> 01:07:05,949
不，我担心你在生我的气
No, I was worried that you were angry with me

1318
01:07:06,192 --> 01:07:09,387
因为这是一件我不能够承担的事情
since it's the one thing I would not be able to bear.

1319
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:12,311
请你原谅一个傻老头
Please forgive a foolish old man.

1320
01:07:12,355 --> 01:07:13,780
哦，不不不
Oh, no, no, no.

1321
01:07:13,813 --> 01:07:14,540
你并没有…
You weren't being...

1322
01:07:14,573 --> 01:07:16,321
哦，也许有一点吧
Well, maybe a little.

1323
01:07:17,124 --> 01:07:18,143
是我的缘故
It was me.

1324
01:07:18,986 --> 01:07:20,467
他会告诉我该思考什么
He'll tell me what to think.

1325
01:07:20,511 --> 01:07:21,355
谁？
Who?

1326
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:24,087
我的笔记本！我以为把它弄丢了呢
My notebook! I thought I lost this.

1327
01:07:24,117 --> 01:07:25,403
凯瑟琳，谁？
Catherine, who?

1328
01:07:26,846 --> 01:07:30,408
我爸爸…那颗彗星…周五，10点35
My dad... the comet...Friday, 10:35.

1329
01:07:31,571 --> 01:07:32,976
亲爱的{\fs12} [德语]{\r}
Liebchen...

1330
01:07:33,019 --> 01:07:35,935
我知道我们取笑你的詹姆斯
I know we make fun of your James.

1331
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:40,896
我们叫他“老鼠男”和“啮齿国王”
We call him "the rat man" and "the rodent king."

1332
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:41,941
还有“次等教授”
And "the lesser professor"

1333
01:07:41,985 --> 01:07:44,422
- 对  - 还有“粪便心理学家”
- Ja. - and "the excremental psychologist."

1334
01:07:44,465 --> 01:07:46,946
对…还有“猴唇爵士”
Ja...and "sir monkey lips."

1335
01:07:46,990 --> 01:07:48,208
“黑猩猩皮条客”
"Chimp pimp."

1336
01:07:48,522 --> 01:07:49,993
这些都到此为止
This all stops now.

1337
01:07:51,533 --> 01:07:52,801
我对你的希望是
What I wish for you:

1338
01:07:52,834 --> 01:07:55,347
你走出去，好好生活
You go out and have a good life.

1339
01:07:56,390 --> 01:07:57,696
你认真的吗？
You mean that?

1340
01:07:59,489 --> 01:08:01,265
我刚跟他说过话
I just spoke with him.

1341
01:08:01,650 --> 01:08:03,093
谁？
Who?

1342
01:08:03,136 --> 01:08:05,251
跟老鼠…跟詹姆斯
With the rat... with James.

1343
01:08:05,895 --> 01:08:12,223
明天我们一起出去，我们来一次远足
Tomorrow, we all go together, and we have an excursion.

1344
01:08:14,405 --> 01:08:16,533
哈罗？有人迷失在…
Hello? Someone lost in...

1345
01:08:16,976 --> 01:08:17,934
哈罗
Hello.

1346
01:08:17,977 --> 01:08:19,125
我们听见叫喊声
We heard screaming.

1347
01:08:19,378 --> 01:08:20,675
- 叫喊？  - 对对
- Screaming? - Ja, ja.

1348
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:22,452
我们在找爱因斯坦教授
We are looking for professor Einstein.

1349
01:08:22,495 --> 01:08:23,809
他说你们在一起
He said you would be together.

1350
01:08:23,852 --> 01:08:25,128
哦，对，但不在这里
Uh, yes, but not here.

1351
01:08:25,271 --> 01:08:26,438
我正要跟他去出海
I'm going sailing with him.

1352
01:08:26,461 --> 01:08:28,828
哦，出海…当然啦
Oh, sailing... of course!

1353
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:30,659
我们…我们搞错了
We were... we were mistaken.

1354
01:08:30,972 --> 01:08:32,113
我们从没出过海
We never go sailing.

1355
01:08:32,157 --> 01:08:32,941
真的吗？
Really?

1356
01:08:33,385 --> 01:08:36,760
他说鱼不想吃我们刚吃的东西
He says the fish don't want to eat what we have just eaten.

1357
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:40,682
我最好查看一下这个
I'd better check on this.

1358
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:41,914
不不，他没事
No, no! He's fine.

1359
01:08:41,958 --> 01:08:43,438
不要碰任何东西
Don't touch anything.

1360
01:08:51,619 --> 01:08:52,643
安静
Quiet!

1361
01:08:55,014 --> 01:08:57,977
这就是我们在物理学中缺失的：喊叫
This is what we miss in physics: screaming.

1362
01:08:58,666 --> 01:09:01,648
如果有人喊叫，一般来说就是我
If anybody screams, it's usually me.

1363
01:09:01,712 --> 01:09:04,283
哦，拜托不要，不要碰任何东西
Uh, please, don't, don't touch anything.

1364
01:09:13,467 --> 01:09:16,730
你就让那些老鼠四处乱跑，是吗？
You let the rats run around like that, eh?

1365
01:09:17,023 --> 01:09:18,559
你很民主
Very democratic of you.

1366
01:09:19,903 --> 01:09:23,538
18个月的实验研究付之东流
18 months of experimental research gone!

1367
01:09:23,552 --> 01:09:25,845
哦，那些猴子
Oh, the monkeys!

1368
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,730
看得出你很忙
It's plain to see you're very busy.

1369
01:09:28,766 --> 01:09:30,639
我们另找时间再来
We come back another time.

1370
01:09:33,932 --> 01:09:36,360
心理学家啊…好疯狂
Psychologists... So crazy!

1371
01:09:36,503 --> 01:09:37,205
走
Go!

1372
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:38,805
哦，我不明白
Well, I don't understand it.

1373
01:09:38,828 --> 01:09:41,161
他总是做什么都提早10分钟
He's always ten minutes early for everything.

1374
01:09:41,905 --> 01:09:43,989
时间再长我们就要错过风了
Any longer, we lose the wind.

1375
01:09:44,032 --> 01:09:45,320
好了，够了，我们出发
Okay, that's it. We're set.

1376
01:09:45,373 --> 01:09:47,332
我非常失望
I'm very disappointed.

1377
01:09:48,275 --> 01:09:52,332
我原本还期待能更好地了解他呢
I was looking forward to getting to know him better.

1378
01:10:03,216 --> 01:10:05,041
好吧，也许下次吧
well, maybe next time.

1379
01:10:19,803 --> 01:10:20,708
真漂亮
It's pretty.

1380
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:25,756
- 抱歉  - 没关系，你没事吧？
- Sorry. - It's all right. You okay?

1381
01:10:25,803 --> 01:10:27,502
阿尔伯特舅舅…
Uncle Albert...

1382
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:29,134
省省吧
cut it out!

1383
01:10:29,977 --> 01:10:30,940
听着，凯瑟琳
Listen, Catherine,

1384
01:10:30,954 --> 01:10:33,198
- 有件事我得告诉你  - 不，听着，呃
- there's something I have to tell you. - No, listen, uh...

1385
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:35,462
我知道阿尔伯特舅舅和所有人…
I know that Uncle Albert and everybody

1386
01:10:35,505 --> 01:10:38,352
想让我们…你知道的
wants us to... you know.

1387
01:10:38,596 --> 01:10:40,718
- 但还有一件事  - 不，你得让我说完
- But there's something else... - No. You have to let me finish.

1388
01:10:40,730 --> 01:10:42,132
只不过那个…
It's just that...

1389
01:10:42,302 --> 01:10:45,315
就是，两个人之间的爱情…
Well, love between two people, uh...

1390
01:10:50,213 --> 01:10:51,348
抱歉
Sorry.

1391
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:52,914
阿尔伯特舅舅
Uncle Albert!

1392
01:10:52,958 --> 01:10:55,265
我在操控这条船
I'm steering the boat.

1393
01:10:59,399 --> 01:11:00,531
爱情…
Love...

1394
01:11:00,574 --> 01:11:02,054
不
No.

1395
01:11:02,098 --> 01:11:06,380
有共同目标和兴趣的人…
People who share common goals and interests...

1396
01:11:06,412 --> 01:11:08,347
你听说过绿藻色吗？
Did you ever hear of the color algae?

1397
01:11:08,451 --> 01:11:09,148
没有
No.

1398
01:11:09,615 --> 01:11:12,717
总之，重点在于，艾德，那个…
Anyway, the point is, Ed, that, um...

1399
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:15,267
你不能选择你会爱上谁
you can't choose who you're gonna love.

1400
01:11:15,441 --> 01:11:16,099
哦，这我知道
Well, I know that.

1401
01:11:16,122 --> 01:11:17,833
你知道吧？它就是自然发生的
You know? It just happens.

1402
01:11:17,926 --> 01:11:20,259
而且我认为你是个正派的人
And I think you're a decent person

1403
01:11:20,523 --> 01:11:21,878
而且我尊重你…
and I respect you...

1404
01:11:21,921 --> 01:11:22,950
我也尊重你
I respect you, too.

1405
01:11:22,970 --> 01:11:25,406
谢谢你，而且我知道你对我的感觉
Thank you. And I know how you feel about me.

1406
01:11:25,429 --> 01:11:27,384
只不过你不能…
It's just that you can't...

1407
01:11:27,827 --> 01:11:30,114
你不能期望一个你刚认识的人…
you can't expect somebody who you've just met--

1408
01:11:30,137 --> 01:11:33,813
一个几乎不了解你的人突然就说…
somebody who hardly knows you to suddenly say...

1409
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:38,525
我爱你
I love you.

1410
01:11:38,769 --> 01:11:40,179
我明白，那没关系
I understand. That's okay.

1411
01:11:41,223 --> 01:11:43,021
不，我爱你
No, I love you.

1412
01:11:43,364 --> 01:11:44,488
我的确爱
I do!

1413
01:11:44,931 --> 01:11:47,212
我的确爱，我说出来了！
I do! I said it!

1414
01:11:47,630 --> 01:11:48,818
你爱我？
You love me?

1415
01:11:48,932 --> 01:11:52,539
对！我爱你！
Yes! I love you.

1416
01:11:54,585 --> 01:11:57,369
- 阿尔伯特舅舅，拜托你别那样了好吗？  - 你停手好吗？
Uncle Albert, would you please cut that out? - Would you stop?

1417
01:11:58,401 --> 01:12:00,617
现在我可以自己来了
I can do it myself now.

1418
01:12:12,724 --> 01:12:14,405
哇呼
Wahoo.

1419
01:12:16,623 --> 01:12:17,664
你们感觉到了吗？
Did you feel that?

1420
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:18,826
对
Ja!

1421
01:12:18,870 --> 01:12:21,841
在某个地方，一个原子与另一个原子发生了碰撞
Somewhere, an atom collided with an atom

1422
01:12:22,225 --> 01:12:24,605
这个又与一个原子碰撞，如此持续
that collided with an atom, and so on

1423
01:12:24,849 --> 01:12:26,403
一直到碰撞了我们
until it collided with us!

1424
01:12:27,695 --> 01:12:28,835
敬原子…
To atoms...

1425
01:12:29,101 --> 01:12:31,491
那些性感的小变态
those sexy little kinkies.

1426
01:12:33,319 --> 01:12:34,852
就说你认为自己爱上了这个…
Suppose you think you're in love with this...

1427
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,401
这个机修工，是吧？
this mechanic, do you?

1428
01:12:36,544 --> 01:12:38,198
是的！艾德！
Yes! Ed!

1429
01:12:38,442 --> 01:12:39,839
我爱上了他
I'm in love with him!

1430
01:12:40,603 --> 01:12:41,588
让我来解释…
Let me explain...

1431
01:12:41,843 --> 01:12:42,790
这是…这是…
It's...it's...

1432
01:12:43,634 --> 01:12:44,722
这是一种迷恋
it's an infatuation.

1433
01:12:45,865 --> 01:12:46,932
这不是爱
It's not love.

1434
01:12:47,476 --> 01:12:49,920
他长相讨人喜欢，他很受欢迎…
He's pleasant-looking, he's, he's popular...

1435
01:12:50,001 --> 01:12:51,055
阿尔伯特舅舅喜欢他
Uncle Albert likes him,

1436
01:12:51,068 --> 01:12:54,736
所以，很自然你感觉到吸引，不过…
so, naturally, you feel attracted, but it...

1437
01:12:55,980 --> 01:12:57,735
它不会持久
it won't last.

1438
01:12:58,478 --> 01:13:00,607
我们所拥有的就会持久
What we have will last:

1439
01:13:01,421 --> 01:13:03,262
共同的目标和兴趣
Common aims and interests...

1440
01:13:03,906 --> 01:13:05,046
语言沟通…
verbal communications...

1441
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:07,428
财务安全…
financial security...

1442
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:10,274
智力的兼容
intellectual compatibility.

1443
01:13:10,817 --> 01:13:12,228
那爱情呢？
What about love?

1444
01:13:15,231 --> 01:13:17,303
听着像是100美元的刹车活儿，弗兰克
Sounds like a hundred-dollar brake job, Frank.

1445
01:13:18,146 --> 01:13:20,279
连动杆报废，艾德？
Busted tappets. Ed?

1446
01:13:21,323 --> 01:13:22,146
啥？
Huh?

1447
01:13:22,489 --> 01:13:23,674
你怎么想的？
What do you think?

1448
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:27,247
她爱我
She loves me.

1449
01:13:30,044 --> 01:13:31,782
我以为这就是你的目的啊
I thought that was the idea.

1450
01:13:32,225 --> 01:13:33,483
你一直没告诉她，是吧？
You haven't told her, have you?

1451
01:13:33,521 --> 01:13:34,528
我一直在尝试
I've been trying.

1452
01:13:34,552 --> 01:13:36,426
啊，什么也别告诉他们，我就这么说
Ah, tell 'em nothing, that's what I say.

1453
01:13:36,469 --> 01:13:37,949
没那么难
It's not that hard.

1454
01:13:37,992 --> 01:13:40,125
你只要给她打电话，然后说
You just call her up and say,

1455
01:13:40,168 --> 01:13:42,954
“你好，我是个撒谎的油腻猴子”
"Hello. I'm a lying grease monkey."

1456
01:13:43,497 --> 01:13:45,130
别烦我，行不行？
Leave me alone, will you?

1457
01:13:45,713 --> 01:13:47,267
会没事的
It's going to be all right.

1458
01:13:48,111 --> 01:13:49,917
她爱我
She loves me.

1459
01:14:05,759 --> 01:14:07,200
它会不会有效？
Will it work?

1460
01:14:08,144 --> 01:14:09,451
它会不会有效？
Will it work?

1461
01:14:10,985 --> 01:14:12,175
你永远不知道
You never know.

1462
01:14:14,930 --> 01:14:17,040
我以前见过这个
I've seen this before.

1463
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:18,820
对啊，所有的报纸上都有：
Well, yes, it's been in all the papers:

1464
01:14:18,864 --> 01:14:20,818
艾德·沃尔特斯的冷聚变
Ed Walters' cold fusion.

1465
01:14:20,931 --> 01:14:23,072
不不，我是说几年前
No, no, I mean years ago...

1466
01:14:23,106 --> 01:14:24,561
某个地方
somewhere.

1467
01:14:27,738 --> 01:14:30,097
首先我想说，我骗你…
First I want to say, "I lie you...

1468
01:14:30,121 --> 01:14:31,956
我…我爱你
"I-I love you.

1469
01:14:32,699 --> 01:14:34,135
我是个…是个骗子
I'm a l... a liar."

1470
01:14:43,634 --> 01:14:45,364
一直以来有些事情…
There's been some things

1471
01:14:46,208 --> 01:14:48,419
我没有完全诚实以对
that I haven't been completely honest about,

1472
01:14:48,902 --> 01:14:51,247
而我愿意…
and, um, I would like the...

1473
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:53,323
等一下，凯瑟琳
Just a minute, Catherine.

1474
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:55,823
{\a9}（地球停转之日）

1475
01:14:57,638 --> 01:14:58,656
爱德华·沃尔特斯？
Edward Walters?

1476
01:14:59,230 --> 01:14:59,857
是？
Yes?

1477
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:02,630
安静，跟你说话你才说
Quiet. Speak when you're spoken to.

1478
01:15:02,653 --> 01:15:04,649
动作自然，回话保持简短
Act natural. Keep the answers short.

1479
01:15:04,692 --> 01:15:07,520
爱德华…爱德华，我要你来见见…
Edward... Edward, I want you to meet

1480
01:15:07,968 --> 01:15:09,736
合众国的总统
the President of the United States.

1481
01:15:10,030 --> 01:15:10,781
艾克？
Ike?!

1482
01:15:10,884 --> 01:15:12,043
你是…你是…
You're... you're...

1483
01:15:12,486 --> 01:15:13,218
你是那个…
you're the...

1484
01:15:13,761 --> 01:15:15,133
你是艾森豪威尔总统
You're President Eisenhower.

1485
01:15:15,176 --> 01:15:17,396
哦，至少到下次选举前是
Well, at least until the next election.

1486
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:22,880
呣，这是什么特殊的…时机吗？
Um, some special... occasion?

1487
01:15:24,856 --> 01:15:26,863
我正在等一个人…
I'm expecting someone...

1488
01:15:29,006 --> 01:15:29,887
一个朋友…
a friend...

1489
01:15:30,530 --> 01:15:31,094
凯瑟琳
Catherine.

1490
01:15:31,112 --> 01:15:31,850
凯瑟琳·博伊德？
Catherine Boyd?

1491
01:15:31,873 --> 01:15:32,381
对
Yes.

1492
01:15:32,439 --> 01:15:34,026
阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦的外甥女
Albert Einstein's niece.

1493
01:15:34,370 --> 01:15:35,219
我必须告诉她一件事
I have to tell her something.

1494
01:15:37,807 --> 01:15:39,927
哦，小伙子，关于这个引擎…
Well, son, about this engine...

1495
01:15:39,981 --> 01:15:42,552
呃，我们何时能看到一台可工作的原型机？
Uh, when can we see a working prototype?

1496
01:15:42,915 --> 01:15:43,957
一台原型机？
A-A prototype?

1497
01:15:43,971 --> 01:15:47,225
俄国人已经宣布他们要在一年内拥有一台可工作的模型
The Russians have announced that they'll have a working model within the year.

1498
01:15:47,473 --> 01:15:49,083
总统想要发表一个声明说…
The President would like to make an announcement that...

1499
01:15:49,107 --> 01:15:51,541
我们正在新泽西这里制造一台原型机
we are building a prototype here in New Jersey.

1500
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:54,015
我们今晚有个记者招待会
We have a press conference tonight.

1501
01:15:54,039 --> 01:15:55,816
七点钟在研讨会上
7:00 at the symposium.

1502
01:15:55,830 --> 01:15:58,849
我希望可以告诉他们我们将准备就绪，时间在…
I'd like to be able to tell them we'll have something ready by say, um...

1503
01:15:59,046 --> 01:16:00,221
七点吗？
7:00?

1504
01:16:07,751 --> 01:16:10,131
到时艾森豪威尔告诉大家好消息
Then Eisenhower tells everyone the good news!

1505
01:16:10,225 --> 01:16:11,337
有好消息吗？
There's good news?

1506
01:16:11,401 --> 01:16:12,926
关于原型机的
About the prototype!

1507
01:16:13,042 --> 01:16:14,540
爱德华知道这事吗？
Does Edward know this?

1508
01:16:14,584 --> 01:16:16,572
当然！这实际上是他的主意！
Sure! It was practically his idea!

1509
01:16:16,605 --> 01:16:17,337
来吧，我们走
Come on, let's go!

1510
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:18,764
他们在前门等我们
They're waiting for us out front!

1511
01:16:24,532 --> 01:16:25,704
哦，我的天
Oh, my god.

1512
01:16:29,115 --> 01:16:30,148
打扰了
Excuse me.

1513
01:16:30,991 --> 01:16:32,328
凯瑟琳·博伊德？
Catherine Boyd?

1514
01:16:33,841 --> 01:16:35,395
我见过你的朋友爱德华
I met your friend Edward.

1515
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:37,345
你一定非常自豪吧
You must be very proud.

1516
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:40,332
我对他有很强烈的感觉
I have very strong feelings about him.

1517
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,432
{\a11}（看彗星）

1518
01:16:44,538 --> 01:16:46,142
我们应该离开这个国家
We should leave the country!

1519
01:16:46,225 --> 01:16:47,286
不要慌张
Don't panic!

1520
01:16:47,490 --> 01:16:48,792
那我们应该什么时候慌张
When should we panic--

1521
01:16:48,835 --> 01:16:50,036
当他们因叛国枪毙我们的时候？
when they shoot us for treason?

1522
01:16:50,050 --> 01:16:52,021
他们不会因叛国而枪毙你
They don't shoot you for treason.

1523
01:16:52,185 --> 01:16:53,971
我认为是电刑
I think it's electrocution.

1524
01:16:59,629 --> 01:17:02,153
艾德，那是艾德
Ed. It's Ed!

1525
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:03,963
凯瑟琳在哪里？
Where's Catherine?!

1526
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:06,218
跟艾森豪威尔在一起
With Eisenhower!

1527
01:17:13,473 --> 01:17:14,291
退后
Back!

1528
01:17:14,934 --> 01:17:16,707
待在后面，先生
Stay back, sir!

1529
01:17:36,627 --> 01:17:39,103
凯瑟琳！停下！
Catherine! Stop!

1530
01:17:41,602 --> 01:17:43,411
- 那不是，呃…  - 沃尔特斯！
- Isn't that, uh...? - Walters!

1531
01:17:43,635 --> 01:17:44,312
艾德
Ed!

1532
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:46,037
凯瑟琳
Catherine!

1533
01:17:47,546 --> 01:17:48,752
凯瑟琳，站住！
Catherine! Stop!

1534
01:17:48,795 --> 01:17:50,210
恭喜，年轻的女士
Congratulations, young lady.

1535
01:17:51,354 --> 01:17:53,903
我跟梅米求婚的时候也是一样的感觉
I felt the same way when I proposed to Mamie.

1536
01:17:53,914 --> 01:17:54,800
总统先生，我认为你最好是…
Mr. President, I think you'd better get...

1537
01:17:54,812 --> 01:17:57,469
没关系没关系，停车
It's okay. Okay. Stop the car.

1538
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:07,697
那不是艾德·沃尔特斯吗？
Isn't that Ed Walters?

1539
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:08,741
对，是他
Yeah, that's him.

1540
01:18:08,975 --> 01:18:09,786
有什么问题吗？
Some kind of problem?

1541
01:18:10,829 --> 01:18:11,944
我们为什么停车？
Why'd we stop?

1542
01:18:18,925 --> 01:18:19,683
凯瑟琳…
Catherine...

1543
01:18:19,706 --> 01:18:21,000
不要跟我说话
Don't talk to me,

1544
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:22,970
你撒谎，你造假，你伪装
you liar, you fake, you phony...

1545
01:18:23,003 --> 01:18:24,152
你发现了
You found out.

1546
01:18:24,496 --> 01:18:26,193
你怎么会以为我有那么笨？
How could you think I was that stupid?

1547
01:18:26,887 --> 01:18:28,586
我没认为你笨，你怎么发现的？
I don't think you're stupid. How'd you find out?

1548
01:18:28,674 --> 01:18:30,232
我算出来的，好吗？
I figured it out, okay?

1549
01:18:30,275 --> 01:18:31,107
我就是算出来了
I just figured it out.

1550
01:18:31,150 --> 01:18:32,438
我把两个两个放在一起
I put two and two together--

1551
01:18:32,482 --> 01:18:35,061
- V除以R等于H  - 那个方程式？那太棒了，太好了！
- V over R equals H... - The formula? That's fantastic! That's great!

1552
01:18:35,229 --> 01:18:37,509
住手！你这假…
Stop it! You fake...

1553
01:18:37,553 --> 01:18:38,728
吻我吧
Just kiss me.

1554
01:18:38,831 --> 01:18:39,529
什么？
What?

1555
01:18:40,712 --> 01:18:42,348
这就来，艾克！
Be right there, Ike!

1556
01:18:42,602 --> 01:18:43,689
不着急
Take your time!

1557
01:18:44,833 --> 01:18:46,898
总统以为你在跟我求婚
The president thinks that you are proposing to me,

1558
01:18:46,921 --> 01:18:48,063
所以亲吻我吧
so just kiss me.

1559
01:18:48,076 --> 01:18:49,434
我们有好多麻烦呢
We're in a lot of trouble here.

1560
01:18:55,008 --> 01:18:56,546
我看着是同意了
Looks like a yes to me.

1561
01:18:56,589 --> 01:18:57,747
对，是啊
Yes, it does.

1562
01:18:59,792 --> 01:19:01,367
你…你这机修工
You... you mechanic.

1563
01:19:01,711 --> 01:19:04,125
看？我对于你就是这样，就是个机修工
See? That's all I am to you, just a mechanic,

1564
01:19:04,144 --> 01:19:05,102
- 对吧？  - 是的
- right?  - Yeah!

1565
01:19:05,645 --> 01:19:06,583
你的名字真的是艾德吗？
Is your name really Ed?

1566
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:07,452
是的，是艾德
Yes, it's Ed.

1567
01:19:07,945 --> 01:19:08,575
你真的在一家汽修厂工作？
Do you really work at a garage?

1568
01:19:08,591 --> 01:19:11,095
对，就在那家汽修厂你第一次见到我就爱上我
Yes, a garage where you fell in love with me

1569
01:19:11,128 --> 01:19:11,896
记得吗？
remember?

1570
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:13,345
那是真的，是事实
That's real. That's true.

1571
01:19:13,589 --> 01:19:14,333
好疼
That hurts!

1572
01:19:14,677 --> 01:19:15,634
就一会儿，艾克
One second, Ike!

1573
01:19:19,372 --> 01:19:21,422
哦，老天在上…
Oh, for God's sake...

1574
01:19:25,868 --> 01:19:26,645
你知道吗？
You know what?

1575
01:19:26,826 --> 01:19:27,646
什么？
What?

1576
01:19:28,691 --> 01:19:29,614
你必须知道
You had to know.

1577
01:19:29,961 --> 01:19:30,814
你必须知道你的一个特质
Something in you had to know.

1578
01:19:30,957 --> 01:19:31,585
你不蠢
You're not dumb.

1579
01:19:31,612 --> 01:19:32,377
不，我蠢！
Yes, I am!

1580
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:34,630
- 不，我蠢  - 不，我认为你以前想随波逐流
- Yes, I am! - No, I think you wanted to go along with it.

1581
01:19:34,722 --> 01:19:36,414
事实上，我认为你需要这样
As a matter of fact, I think you needed to.

1582
01:19:36,498 --> 01:19:37,869
某种程度上，你应该感谢我
In a way, you should be thanking me.

1583
01:19:38,113 --> 01:19:39,310
感谢你？
Thanking you?

1584
01:19:40,354 --> 01:19:41,312
老天爷
Geez...

1585
01:19:41,715 --> 01:19:43,053
这就来了，艾克
Be right there, Ike!

1586
01:19:44,937 --> 01:19:45,730
你咬我
You bit me!

1587
01:19:47,374 --> 01:19:48,232
抱歉，艾德
Sorry, Ed.

1588
01:19:48,875 --> 01:19:49,925
抱歉咬了你
Sorry about that.

1589
01:19:50,713 --> 01:19:51,801
听着，艾德
Listen, Ed.

1590
01:19:52,244 --> 01:19:53,237
你说得对
You're right.

1591
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:55,500
我从你身上学到了不少东西，知道吗？
I've learned quite a bit from you, you know?

1592
01:19:55,843 --> 01:19:56,502
我有着…
I have a...

1593
01:19:56,545 --> 01:19:58,764
我有很厉害的头脑，我应该信任它
I have a great brain and I should trust that.

1594
01:19:58,808 --> 01:20:01,627
- 对  - 而且…而且不在于你是做什么的
- Yeah. - And...And it's not about what you do.

1595
01:20:01,661 --> 01:20:02,610
而在于你是什么样的人
It's about who you are.

1596
01:20:03,140 --> 01:20:04,438
所以，这是我跟你学到的
So, I've learned that from you.

1597
01:20:04,441 --> 01:20:05,345
所以要谢谢你
So, thank you.

1598
01:20:14,410 --> 01:20:15,024
假货
Fake.

1599
01:20:15,130 --> 01:20:17,653
阿尔伯特…怎么啦？
Albert...what's going on?

1600
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:22,527
凯瑟琳刚刚发现
Catherine has just found out

1601
01:20:22,570 --> 01:20:25,709
爱德华并不真的是个科学家
that Edward is not really a scientist.

1602
01:20:25,952 --> 01:20:28,884
他只不过是一个汽车机修工
He is simply an automobile mechanic.

1603
01:20:29,881 --> 01:20:33,226
一个汽车机修工懂个啥玩意儿的冷聚变？
What the hell does an automobile mechanic know about cold fusion?

1604
01:20:33,276 --> 01:20:35,192
一点不懂，一切都是个大谎言
Nothing. It's all a big lie.

1605
01:20:35,635 --> 01:20:37,498
四月愚人节？
April Fool's?

1606
01:20:39,531 --> 01:20:40,676
我们本来没有恶意
We meant no harm.

1607
01:20:41,212 --> 01:20:42,286
只是几个老人…
Just foolish old men...

1608
01:20:42,329 --> 01:20:45,093
所以关于冷聚变我是对的，是吗？
So I was right about the cold fusion, wasn't I?

1609
01:20:45,132 --> 01:20:46,338
凯瑟琳，你有没有意识到
Catherine, do you realize

1610
01:20:46,382 --> 01:20:50,266
你已经最终证明了我的方法是不可能的
that you have proven conclusively that my approach is impossible?

1611
01:20:50,307 --> 01:20:51,325
结论性的
Conclusively.

1612
01:20:51,339 --> 01:20:53,200
这我知道，但你说的是…
I knew that, but you said that...

1613
01:20:53,224 --> 01:20:54,442
对，我的意思是
Ja. I meant that

1614
01:20:54,456 --> 01:20:57,667
我不能证明或证伪它
I could not prove it or disprove it.

1615
01:20:57,910 --> 01:21:00,347
因此，我不能发表它
Therefore, I could not publish it.

1616
01:21:01,081 --> 01:21:02,741
我做到了一件你做不到的事情？
I did something that you couldn't do?

1617
01:21:02,785 --> 01:21:05,222
对，这是，呃，数学
Ja. It's, uh, mathematics.

1618
01:21:05,645 --> 01:21:08,529
我一向在数学上很糟糕
I was always terrible at mathematics.

1619
01:21:08,573 --> 01:21:09,705
教授…
Professor...

1620
01:21:13,796 --> 01:21:16,929
艾德·沃尔特斯的核燃料理论
Ed Walters' atomic fuel theory.

1621
01:21:17,173 --> 01:21:20,411
一篇未发表的，阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦的论文
An unpublished paper of Albert Einstein's

1622
01:21:20,433 --> 01:21:21,911
30年前写的
written 30 years ago.

1623
01:21:22,666 --> 01:21:25,516
先生们，它们是一样的
Gentlemen, they are identical.

1624
01:21:25,945 --> 01:21:29,207
在各方面都是一样的
In every respect, identical.

1625
01:21:29,350 --> 01:21:31,739
你是在指控艾德·沃尔特斯剽窃吗？
Are you accusing Ed Walters of plagiarism?

1626
01:21:32,328 --> 01:21:33,493
难说
Hardly.

1627
01:21:33,733 --> 01:21:36,906
我是在指控艾德·沃尔特斯和爱因斯坦教授
I'm accusing Ed Walters and Professor Einstein

1628
01:21:36,949 --> 01:21:41,432
以及他的同仁们，进行…呃…
and his colleagues... of, um...

1629
01:21:43,875 --> 01:21:45,684
进行彻头彻尾的欺诈
of outright fraud.

1630
01:21:46,128 --> 01:21:48,655
冷聚变不过是个骗局罢了
Cold fusion is nothing more than a hoax.

1631
01:21:54,937 --> 01:21:56,795
如果你们愿意耐心等等我们
If you will please bear with us

1632
01:21:56,839 --> 01:21:59,529
爱因斯坦教授有一项声明要发布
Professor Einstein has a statement to make.

1633
01:21:59,572 --> 01:22:01,579
谢谢你，总统先生
Thank you, Mr. President.

1634
01:22:02,222 --> 01:22:03,667
女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

1635
01:22:05,042 --> 01:22:08,067
詹姆斯·莫兰德博士是对的
Dr. James Morland is correct.

1636
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:11,461
冷聚变是一场骗局
Cold fusion is a hoax.

1637
01:22:12,423 --> 01:22:15,520
这场骗局如此聪明，如此大胆，如此机密
A hoax so brilliant, so daring, so secret

1638
01:22:15,545 --> 01:22:19,861
地球上知道这件事的人不超过5人
not more than five people on the planet Earth know about it.

1639
01:22:21,004 --> 01:22:24,512
我们称之为“红甘蓝行动”
We called it "Operation Red Cabbage."

1640
01:22:24,771 --> 01:22:26,426
但现在，我们可以透露
But now, we can reveal

1641
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,329
通过我的同事博伊德小姐的努力
through the efforts of my colleague, Miss Boyd

1642
01:22:30,373 --> 01:22:31,974
还有沃尔特斯先生
and Mr. Walters--

1643
01:22:32,463 --> 01:22:34,950
两个最优秀的头脑
two of the finest minds

1644
01:22:34,974 --> 01:22:38,177
我很荣幸地获知…
it has ever been my privilege to know--

1645
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:40,708
我们已经证明了…
we have proven...

1646
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:47,585
俄国人声称在冷聚变太空竞赛中取得的跃进
the Russian claim to have leapt ahead in the space race with cold fusion

1647
01:22:47,732 --> 01:22:49,848
不过是无稽之谈
is nothing but hot air.

1648
01:22:55,685 --> 01:22:57,364
个人而言，我认为…
Personally, I think

1649
01:22:57,417 --> 01:23:02,165
任何这一类的竞赛…武器或是太空
any race of this nature--arms or space--

1650
01:23:02,508 --> 01:23:05,342
都完全是蠢事
is complete foolishness.

1651
01:23:05,535 --> 01:23:07,472
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

1652
01:23:12,781 --> 01:23:14,021
一次大师级的行动，各位
A master stroke, gentlemen.

1653
01:23:14,044 --> 01:23:15,418
这是一次学院的胜利
A triumph for the institute.

1654
01:23:18,181 --> 01:23:20,010
凯瑟琳，亲爱的，你一定要了解
Catherine, darling, you must understand.

1655
01:23:20,053 --> 01:23:21,403
我说的话都是出于善意
I said what I said in good faith.

1656
01:23:22,647 --> 01:23:23,406
阿尔伯特
Albert

1657
01:23:23,417 --> 01:23:25,706
喂，阿尔伯特舅舅，这次不会成功的
Uncle Albert, that's not going to work this time.

1658
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:31,691
不幸，凯瑟琳，这次是真的
Unfortunately, Catherine, this is the real thing.

1659
01:23:32,935 --> 01:23:35,198
拜托，我要去医院
Please, I go to the hospital.

1660
01:23:37,535 --> 01:23:38,398
慢点
Slowly.

1661
01:23:43,423 --> 01:23:48,026
伙计们，拜托，不过是一点心颤
Boys, please, it's just a little flutter.

1662
01:23:48,223 --> 01:23:50,335
拜托，出去吧，看看那彗星
Please, go out, see the comet.

1663
01:23:50,978 --> 01:23:52,690
去找几个女孩吧
Go get some girls.

1664
01:23:53,433 --> 01:23:55,044
我们要不要给你找一个？
Should we get one for you?

1665
01:23:55,087 --> 01:23:57,089
好，红头发的
Ja, a redhead.

1666
01:23:57,133 --> 01:23:58,221
留下，爱德华
Stay, Edward.

1667
01:23:58,264 --> 01:23:59,344
再见，伙计们
Good-bye, boys.

1668
01:23:59,387 --> 01:24:00,663
谢谢过来
Thanks for coming.

1669
01:24:01,006 --> 01:24:04,441
我很快会见到你们大家
I will see you all shortly.

1670
01:24:04,475 --> 01:24:05,663
在上面
Up there.

1671
01:24:08,021 --> 01:24:11,604
不用花什么时间就没事啦
It will be okay in no time.

1672
01:24:12,148 --> 01:24:15,238
- 我以为你说过时间并不存在  - 我说没时间
- I thought you said that time doesn't exist. - I said no time.

1673
01:24:15,281 --> 01:24:16,387
他啥也没说过
He said nothing.

1674
01:24:17,430 --> 01:24:22,407
你们看，我总是想象天堂是一个庞大的图书馆
You know, I always imagined heaven to be one enormous library.

1675
01:24:23,032 --> 01:24:25,470
只不过你不能把书带走
Only you can't take out the books.

1676
01:24:28,852 --> 01:24:31,478
哦，我要拿我裤子里的一件东西
Oh, I need something from my trousers.

1677
01:24:31,502 --> 01:24:32,604
哦，我来拿
Oh, I'll get it.

1678
01:24:34,147 --> 01:24:36,337
在左手口袋里
It's in the left-hand pocket.

1679
01:24:36,381 --> 01:24:37,817
左手
The left hand.

1680
01:24:38,461 --> 01:24:40,325
不，另一个左手
No, the other left hand.

1681
01:24:40,358 --> 01:24:41,604
要我找什么？
What am I looking for?

1682
01:24:42,147 --> 01:24:43,212
对，就是它
Ja, that's it.

1683
01:24:43,235 --> 01:24:44,689
你找到了，谢谢你
You found it. Thank you.

1684
01:24:44,932 --> 01:24:46,666
把它拿过来，劳驾
Bring it here, please.

1685
01:24:48,710 --> 01:24:52,153
对，我的指南针
Ja, my compass.

1686
01:24:53,797 --> 01:24:55,775
我的记忆
My memory is...

1687
01:24:57,019 --> 01:24:58,315
跟我的父亲…
of my father

1688
01:25:00,419 --> 01:25:02,415
在我五岁的时候
when I was five years old.

1689
01:25:05,958 --> 01:25:08,682
我想我那时也是生病在床上
I think I was sick in bed then, too.

1690
01:25:09,726 --> 01:25:12,295
他给了我这个指南针
He gave me this compass.

1691
01:25:12,883 --> 01:25:17,164
当我第一次把它拿在手中时
When I first held it in my hand,

1692
01:25:17,333 --> 01:25:19,624
我就惊讶好奇
I was wonder-struck

1693
01:25:19,837 --> 01:25:25,743
是什么力量，无形而又不可感觉
by what force, invisible and unfelt

1694
01:25:26,686 --> 01:25:28,872
可能在把握这根针
could be holding the needle.

1695
01:25:32,797 --> 01:25:35,040
给，爱德华，你拿着它
Here, Edward, you take this

1696
01:25:35,883 --> 01:25:38,538
这样你永远不会迷失道路
so that you never lose your way.

1697
01:25:38,652 --> 01:25:41,454
你还要保持你的好奇心
And you keep your sense of wonder.

1698
01:25:43,235 --> 01:25:45,359
你们俩都有美好的心灵
You both have good hearts.

1699
01:25:50,430 --> 01:25:55,294
不要让你们的大脑干扰你们的心
Don't let your brain interfere with your heart.

1700
01:26:07,744 --> 01:26:10,250
{\a7}（普林斯顿医院 主出入口）

1701
01:26:10,744 --> 01:26:12,050
我真的很想谈谈，艾德
I'd really love to talk, Ed.

1702
01:26:12,094 --> 01:26:13,460
听着，凯瑟琳
Listen, Catherine,

1703
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:16,054
我从未意图把这事弄到这样疯狂
I never meant for this to get as crazy as it did.

1704
01:26:16,098 --> 01:26:20,275
要是我在哪些方面伤害了你，我非常抱歉
If I've hurt you in any way I'm very sorry.

1705
01:26:26,608 --> 01:26:28,093
有那么一个短暂的瞬间
For one brief moment there

1706
01:26:28,116 --> 01:26:34,068
我真实地被一些非常…卓越的人认真对待
I was actually taken seriously by some pretty...extraordinary people.

1707
01:26:35,934 --> 01:26:38,846
那是以前我从未经历过的
And that's never happened to me before.

1708
01:26:39,450 --> 01:26:40,732
那感觉太好了
It felt great.

1709
01:26:42,375 --> 01:26:45,622
我只希望有朝一日…你能…
I just hope at some point that you can...

1710
01:26:45,725 --> 01:26:48,692
…真正相信自己有多么的卓越
...truly believe how extraordinary you are.

1711
01:27:02,214 --> 01:27:03,436
我会想你的
I'll miss you.

1712
01:27:10,013 --> 01:27:11,371
所以你怎么说？
So what are you saying?

1713
01:27:11,815 --> 01:27:14,390
要是我们没有干涉，他们最后会在一起吗？
If we hadn't interfered they would have ended up together?

1714
01:27:14,827 --> 01:27:17,127
一件事干涉一件事
Everything affects everything.

1715
01:27:17,150 --> 01:27:19,685
我相信每件事都会变好的
I believe everything will turn out fine.

1716
01:27:19,699 --> 01:27:20,306
为什么？
Why?

1717
01:27:20,312 --> 01:27:23,070
因为我宁愿当个傻傻的乐天派
Because I would rather be an optimist and a fool

1718
01:27:23,093 --> 01:27:24,800
也不愿当正确的悲观主义者
than a pessimist and right.

1719
01:27:24,827 --> 01:27:26,000
嗯，我们都是傻子
We're all fools.

1720
01:27:26,020 --> 01:27:27,805
我们本来应该坐电梯的
We should have taken the elevator.

1721
01:27:28,558 --> 01:27:29,954
伙子们，拜托
Boys, please.

1722
01:27:30,797 --> 01:27:33,458
你们要吵醒护士了
You're going to wake up the nurses.

1723
01:27:39,359 --> 01:27:40,940
向上23度
23 degrees up.

1724
01:27:40,963 --> 01:27:42,445
不不不，24度
No, no, no. 24 degrees.

1725
01:27:42,688 --> 01:27:44,646
是往下22度
It would be 22 degrees down...

1726
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:48,475
拜托，赶紧的
Please, just do it.

1727
01:27:48,499 --> 01:27:49,436
为啥？为啥？
Why? Why?

1728
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:52,264
一个将死之人的愿望
A dying man's wish.

1729
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:54,172
要及时
In time.

1730
01:27:54,226 --> 01:27:57,016
可是既然时间不存在…
But since time doesn't exist...

1731
01:27:57,760 --> 01:27:58,860
你看见什么？
What do you see?

1732
01:28:00,859 --> 01:28:04,023
我看见…我看见往天文台的路
I see... I see the road to the observatory.

1733
01:28:04,067 --> 01:28:05,355
还有呢，还有呢？
And, and?

1734
01:28:05,918 --> 01:28:07,360
还有那是凯瑟琳
And it's Catherine.

1735
01:28:07,442 --> 01:28:08,384
还有呢？
And?

1736
01:28:08,427 --> 01:28:11,317
她正朝着观星场地去
She is going towards stargazers' field.

1737
01:28:11,561 --> 01:28:12,771
等一下
Wait a minute.

1738
01:28:13,315 --> 01:28:15,434
那是艾德刚才去的地方
That's where Edward went.

1739
01:28:15,748 --> 01:28:19,134
哎哟，哎哟，但凡有个发生偶然的时候
Boy, if ever there was a time for an accident.

1740
01:28:19,177 --> 01:28:23,316
有时候，偶然需要一点帮助
Sometimes, accidents need a little help.

1741
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:27,030
上帝不跟宇宙玩骰子
God does not play dice with the universe

1742
01:28:27,133 --> 01:28:27,838
可是我会
but I will.

1743
01:28:27,941 --> 01:28:29,274
那是一种什么东西？
What kind of a thing is that?

1744
01:28:30,218 --> 01:28:31,194
那是什么？
What is that?

1745
01:28:31,537 --> 01:28:33,957
这个，是一台发射机
This is a transmitter.

1746
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:35,367
看着
Watch.

1747
01:28:41,678 --> 01:28:42,953
奇哉妙也
Wunderbar!

1748
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:46,030
太好了
Great.

1749
01:28:46,573 --> 01:28:47,434
把它推下去
Push it down.

1750
01:28:47,557 --> 01:28:49,138
- 把它推下去  - 是吗？
- Push it down.  - Yeah?

1751
01:28:51,613 --> 01:28:52,580
不要
No!

1752
01:28:53,124 --> 01:28:54,782
我要看看…
I'm going to look at...

1753
01:28:55,126 --> 01:28:56,867
拜托
Please.

1754
01:29:00,613 --> 01:29:02,289
够了！已经够了！
Enough! Enough already!

1755
01:29:02,313 --> 01:29:03,627
我还想她完整无缺地回来呢
I want her back in one piece.

1756
01:29:03,661 --> 01:29:05,271
现在是怎么回事，阿尔伯特？
What's happening now, Albert?

1757
01:29:05,335 --> 01:29:06,439
马达熄火了
The motor has died.

1758
01:29:06,452 --> 01:29:10,010
她驶离了公路进入观星区域
She's turning off the road into stargazers' field.

1759
01:29:12,274 --> 01:29:13,536
让我看看
Let me see!

1760
01:29:40,822 --> 01:29:42,738
就那么发生了，就“嘣”一下
it just happened. Just boom!

1761
01:29:45,171 --> 01:29:46,412
嘣
Boom.

1762
01:29:48,788 --> 01:29:50,421
你相信偶然吗？
Do you believe in accidents?

1763
01:29:52,314 --> 01:29:53,293
不
No.

1764
01:30:19,819 --> 01:30:21,330
这样好正确
This is so right.

1765
01:30:21,373 --> 01:30:24,668
这就是我想看到的样子
This is the way I wanted to see it.

1766
01:30:29,781 --> 01:30:33,093
你听说过七圣池吗？
Have you ever heard of the Seven Sacred Pools?

1767
01:30:33,537 --> 01:30:34,705
在夏威夷？
In Hawaii?

1768
01:30:37,746 --> 01:30:39,374
你还好吗，阿尔伯特？
Are you all right, Albert?

1769
01:30:39,417 --> 01:30:42,555
好，这对我的心脏很有好处
Ja, this is very good for my heart.

1770
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:43,909
哦，我的天
Oh, my god!

1771
01:30:44,453 --> 01:30:45,215
看
Look!

1772
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:49,301
看
Look!

1773
01:30:50,745 --> 01:30:51,982
嗨，爸爸
Hi, Daddy.

1774
01:30:52,105 --> 01:30:53,689
我想念你
I missed you.

1775
01:30:54,632 --> 01:30:55,738
这是艾德
This is Ed,

1776
01:30:55,761 --> 01:30:57,309
我爱的男人
the man I love.

1777
01:31:01,478 --> 01:31:02,901
在这个世界之外
Out of this world.

1778
01:31:08,951 --> 01:31:10,305
怎么样啦？
What's happening?

1779
01:31:32,918 --> 01:31:34,435
哇呼
Wahoo.

1780
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:38,150
哇呼
Wahoo.
