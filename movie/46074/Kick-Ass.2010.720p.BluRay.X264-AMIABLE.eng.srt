4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,320
Guardian of the Universe ...

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,920
Protection against the superpowers
of this man?

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,480
He can catch a ball.

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,520
Look at the sky. Is it a bird?

8
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,120
They are protected by an extraordinary
group of men and women ...

9
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,200
who have dedicated themselves
to fighting crime.

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,760
The forces of them go beyond the
competence of earthlings.

11
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,960
I was always wonder why
nobody ever did for me.

12
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,720
I mean, all those comic books,
movies and TV shows ...

13
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,120
You'd think a costume n eccentric
loner had made.

14
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,560
Is everyday life really
so exciting?

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,920
Are the schools and offices so exciting
that I just fantasize about?

16
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,920
Be honest with yourself.
At one point in our lives ...

17
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,080
we all want a super hero.

18
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,920
I am not.
This is a Armenir with mental
health problems.

19
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,840
Who am I? I Kick Ass.

20
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,720
I am. Before the madness began.

21
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,160
I'm not saying that something
was wrong with me.

22
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,720
But there is not
anything special.

23
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,360
I did not really sports.
I was not 'mateleet.

24
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,560
Whether a hardcore gamer.
I had no piercings.

25
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,120
Or an eating disorder.
Or 3000 friends on MySpace.

26
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,240
My only superpower was invisible
to the girls.

27
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,080
And my friends, I was
not the funniest.

28
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,680
Like most people my age,
I just existed.

29
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,000
Good morning, class.
Turn your book open.

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,720
It seems you do.

31
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,960
If you're pushing at my bedroom
door, I think watching TV.

32
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,680
Or I talk to my friend
Todd on Skype.

33
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,880
Do you watch Family Guy
- No.

34
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,880
Neither do I.
Go to nippleslip.com,
that's good.

35
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,920
Or subtraction.
Mostly because of my
English teacher.

36
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:25,600
Dave Lizewski do not you think
I see you looking at my tits?

37
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,840
I want you to touch me. Please.

38
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,080
What I mean by the
school helped ...

39
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,880
was a contribution to make in the 'relief
department store for later.

40
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,880
To be honest, there was not much
need for me to get excited.

41
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,240
If my hormones are balanced, the
plunging shares of Kleenex.

42
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,480
You would not now be
looking to Hamlet?

43
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,040
Yes, Mrs. Zane.

44
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,840
Sorry.

45
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,880
I also like girls my own age.

46
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,720
Sure Katie Deauxma.
- Hello, beautiful.

47
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:20,360
No, you referred to Erika.
I knew that.

48
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,600
I was just kidding.

49
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,760
Look, I'm Todd's mother.

50
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,320
This is funny. This is your father.
- No, that's still my mother.

51
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,120
I was just an ordinary boy.
... No radioactive spiders

52
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,920
No refugee status of a doomed
world of extraterrestrials.

53
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,360
Todd says she still "Count
Chocula" make.

54
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,200
They sell not only
in the stores.

55
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,960
My mother is deceased to an
aneurisme in the kitchen.

56
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,480
Not by a hitman in an alley.

57
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:06,160
So if you're hoping for some ...
- I will avenge you, mother.

58
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,120
Then you have no luck.
In the 18 months since my
mother is deceased ...

59
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,960
is the only revelation I had,
I realized that life goes on.

60
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,440
Have they changed
the face of who?

61
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,000
No.

62
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,520
Why has nobody ever tried
to be a superhero?

63
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,000
I do not know.
Perhaps because it
is impossible.

64
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,720
A mask, and help people,
why is that impossible?

65
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,480
That's not a superhero.
Super if you're stronger
than anyone.

66
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,280
And so fly, that's a hero.

67
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,280
No, that's not a hero.
This is psychologically
disturbed.

68
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,960
Bruce Wayne had no powers?

69
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,360
Yes, but he had all the expensive
junk that does not exist.

70
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,400
I thought you meant, why does
nobody in real life.

71
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,480
Yes, I meant that.
- If someone does that
in real life ...

72
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,000
they get a kick in the ass, then
they are dead within one day.

73
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,120
I'm not saying they should do it, I just
do not understand why nobody does.

74
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,680
Of all the millions of people
who love superheroes ...

75
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,680
one that would still endeavor.

76
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,800
Are not you cross?

77
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,920
Thousands like Paris Hilton,
why nobody Spiderman.

78
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,360
Yes, it really has no tits.

79
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,040
Maybe it's the porn tape.
He has no porn tape.

80
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,760
Have you ever "One Night
in Spiderman've seen?

81
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,720
Who do you think?

82
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,480
Do you also feel sorry
for Chris D'Amico?

83
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,560
It must be terrible to have a rich father
and everything you want to have.

84
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,640
Did you not say that,
later I still cry.

85
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,040
He was always alone.

86
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,840
Go talk to him.
See if he wants to
come sit with us.

87
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,400
Well, talk to him ...

88
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,440
Great if he wanted to be our friend.
Then motherfuckers never
someone with us.

89
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,840
Come on, Todd. I can ...
- No.

90
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,360
Should I talk to him
- to go Dave.

91
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,680
What?
- You really gotta go.

92
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,720
You're a dick.
- Do not be afraid, Dave.

93
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,080
You're a sissy.

94
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,880
Fuck you.

95
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,080
Have you leaked
- I got into my pants.

96
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,760
I had caught him.

97
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,320
If you ever have someone
kick his ass dungeon

98
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,600
I would go for his knees.

99
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,160
You chattering nonsense.
- The power of Batman ...

100
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,520
went through the force
field of the Joker ...

101
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,320
Patrol sissies.
Telephones, money ...

102
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,480
Come on.

103
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,480
Tel.
- This last week
has been stolen.

104
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,320
Sissy.

105
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,200
Give me the bag then.
- These are just comic books.

106
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,960
Would you be stabbed?

107
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,400
That bastard just looks.

108
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,640
Be honest with yourself.

109
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,200
Would you do differently?

110
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,920
We see someone in trouble,
we would like to help ...

111
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,320
but we do not.

112
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,600
The world in which I lived, there
are only heroes in comic books.

113
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,920
That would not be bad if the bad
guys were or even fantasies.

114
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,320
But they are not.

115
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,640
Frankie, I am really
not making this up.

116
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:48,240
This guy comes from nowhere, and gives us a
lot of our thunder, and steals the coke.

117
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,080
The guy in 'Batman' looks?
I said no.

118
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,560
That you have said.

119
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,960
He had a mask and so on.
- And a cape?

120
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,040
Like Batman.
- I never said, like Batman.

121
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,560
So I have a problem with it.

122
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,080
Our mole says that the Russians
make things different.

123
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,240
According to him, you have sold them
my coke, and have usurped the money.

124
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,800
That is a lie.

125
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:20,000
That you believe that nonsense
from a Russian.

126
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,680
What's more likely ...

127
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,600
that you're a greedy
little dick ...

128
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,280
or that all my coke stolen
from Superman?

129
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,400
Batman.
- I never said that.

130
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,240
Enough!

131
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,400
My son is waiting in the
car to go to the movie.

132
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,680
I do not disappoint him.

133
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,320
Joe, you're in charge.

134
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,240
That's the worst excuse
I ever heard, Tre.

135
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,680
Sorry you had to wait.
- The movie starts
in ten minutes.

136
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,160
'll Be fine.
We lack only the trailers.

137
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,840
But I want popcorn.
- That I buy it for you.

138
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,240
You want a Pepsi?
- Good.

139
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,120
He is a Pepsi and I icee.

140
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,400
Mixed.
Just as they mix the
red and blue.

141
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,840
And a suit Twist Handlers.

142
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,040
The comic books were wrong.

143
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,560
There was no trauma required,
or cosmic rays, a super hero.

144
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,680
Only the perfect combination of optimism
and navigational capacity.

145
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,480
You're awesome!

146
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,720
Come on. Go ahead.

147
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,800
I'm scared, Dad.
- Come on, Mindy, you're
a big girl.

148
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,760
You have nothing to be afraid.

149
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,800
Does it really hurt
- but a moment.

150
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:12,640
A shot up by more than 1100
kilometers per hour.

151
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,960
Up close, you will surely be
thrown down by the force ...

152
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,200
but it is really no more painful
than a slap on your chest.

153
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,000
I hate when I get a
slap on my chest.

154
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,680
Everything will be fine.

155
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,360
That was not so bad?
But nice anyway?

156
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,240
Now you know how it feels.

157
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,360
Now you no longer fear as
a junkie pulls a Glock.

158
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,160
I would not have been afraid.
- That's the spirit. Get up.

159
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,800
Twice, then go home.
- Again?

160
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,640
Only if we go bowling on the way.
- Bowling?

161
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,080
Yes, and then ice.

162
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,760
More than twice.

163
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:07,880
Not cringe, not whining,
you have a deal.

164
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,680
I want a hot fudge sundae.
- Good choice.

165
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,000
What more could you want
for your birthday?

166
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,320
Can I have a puppy?

167
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,440
You want a dog
- a fluffy stuffed animal.

168
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,320
And a movie star makeover
Bratz Sasha doll.

169
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,440
I'll take you but a fool.

170
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:41,520
I want a handmade model 42 butterfly.
- Child, you always
take me a fool.

171
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,960
You get two.

172
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,560
Two
- And two, that you get.

173
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,720
I'll be honest.
In the first weeks there
was not much crime.

174
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,000
Yet I loved my new
job pretty busy.

175
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,840
I called it "preparation".

176
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,200
But if you 'fantasy', is nothing
against this situation.

177
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,520
I only knew that I had
never felt so good.

178
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,760
Maybe I was still in the Beta testing
phase, but it was a start.

179
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,680
What are you looking at?

180
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,240
Nothing.
- Thurs then.

181
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:43,680
As if each knew the serial killer, ultimately
does not fantasize for you.

182
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,360
It was time to get involved.

183
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,560
What is that?

184
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,320
What you looking at?

185
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,360
I said, 'Where are
you looking at?

186
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:17,560
Two losers cheap balls with a car where
someone has worked for destroyed.

187
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,920
What?
- Let go, man.

188
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:27,080
He is clearly high.
- I am not.

189
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,040
You only think you can
do whatever you want.

190
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,160
Go away from the vehicle,
and we forget this.

191
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,160
You're crazy.

192
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,880
Get out.

193
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,240
I was just conscious enough to beg the
doctor to say nothing about the suit.

194
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,920
That he promised.

195
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,880
I just knew my dad
would murder me.

196
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,560
Why do I get a gun? I'm a guard.

197
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,040
You are now a door, you
will get no more gun.

198
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,200
I look like an idiot.
- You look good with
all those buttons.

199
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,760
Do your work and make
that door open.

200
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,680
Happy days.

201
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,840
Tomorrow, Frank.
- How are you, Joe?

202
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,480
Fine.
- Want some coffee?

203
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,920
Maybe later. Tomorrow, Nance.

204
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,080
Chris.
- Morning, Joe.

205
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,800
There is a problem.

206
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,240
A big problem.

207
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,800
Sorry, honey.
- Do what you gotta do.

208
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,080
Where are you going?
- I need to talk to Dad.

209
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,480
Frank, honey.

210
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,360
Where are you going?
- I do not mind you talking
about things.

211
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,240
I'm going to sit there quietly.
I must still learn things.

212
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,640
Eat your oatmeal on.
- I am 18 about eight months.

213
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,960
Sit down.

214
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,040
What is the problem?

215
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,000
Our Russian says Tre just sold another 5 kg.
At half the price.

216
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,800
What Tre
- Tre Dead.

217
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,840
Now I get so screwed by a ghost
- or Tre told the truth.

218
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:57,840
Is this my choice?
Do I believe in ghosts,
or superheroes?

219
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:02,960
No super hero, but I think someone
has taken him to graze.

220
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,520
Let our Rus invite
a friendly chat.

221
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,880
Let's see what's
really going on.

222
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:34,760
Early bird, you have me.
I wanted this morning for
breakfast you get.

223
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,080
Congratulations, honey.

224
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,400
Look.

225
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,560
Thank you.

226
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,160
Daddy.

227
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,520
Cool, Dad.
- Ask.

228
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,480
What is the correct name for this?
- Easy, Filipino.

229
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,120
Still n.
- Excellent. Good.

230
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:12,040
The AR 15 was a smaller lighter
version of what caliber?

231
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,920
Eugene Stoner's AR 10.
Come and work hard.

232
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:23,600
The name of the first film by John Woo.
- Tie Han Rou Qing.
The young dragon.

233
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,440
Daddy, look. You're not looking.

234
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,280
And those bastards killing
our boys so.

235
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,360
Until we know who it is, I want no
more of you on your ass down.

236
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,720
Yes, that is training.

237
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,560
Moment. Dad, phone!

238
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,640
There is phone for you.
- Who is it?

239
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,280
What is the problem
- we have the vice here anymore.

240
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,480
Really?

241
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,040
We do have a brand new industrial microwave
which they use for woodworking.

242
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,360
That is beautiful.

243
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,680
You confuse me with someone who
apparently something to wood.

244
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,480
All right, I'm sorry.
- I want information.

245
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,600
Go ahead.
- The boys, Tre Fernandez.

246
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,600
What do I know?

247
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,920
Now you say that Fernandez is dead.
- Shut up.

248
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,640
He lied.

249
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,480
This works as a real wave?

250
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,280
What I know of.
I do not eat. Turn it on.

251
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,960
I want to know who
our coke sold.

252
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,440
And say this time, someone
who is dead.

253
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,440
I said, 'Who was our
cocaine you sold.

254
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:11,200
Who told you we sell coke?

255
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,480
Some time later.

256
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,720
This is great.
I have been Wolverine.

257
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,560
Did they have metal detectors
in school?

258
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,200
Yes, they will collapse.

259
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,840
I must ask you something.

260
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:42,360
According to the police report, you were found naked.
You do not remember why.

261
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,520
The robbers do not you ...

262
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,800
What?

263
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,800
No, I was not even ...

264
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,960
They took my clothes thrown
away in the ambulance.

265
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,560
By the blood.
- Right.

266
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,600
In no time I was better again.

267
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,000
What is Dave?

268
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,880
Outside some damaged
nerve endings ...

269
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,160
the doctors have me
pretty botched.

270
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,240
Did you know?
- No.

271
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,120
You look like Jason Bourne is.

272
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,840
And then
- No.

273
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,800
Let it sit.

274
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,240
I'm only half a day back, and through
you I miss the hospital now al

275
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,560
He's right. I do very childish.
- Stop it.

276
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,080
How are you? You look better.

277
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,720
Much better.

278
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,120
You fond of cartoons?

279
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,080
Erica and I sometimes go after
school that nice shop ...

280
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,320
Atomic Comics, who make
the best mocha.

281
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,640
Yes?

282
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:17,840
I would sometimes go with you, if
you need someone to talk to.

283
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:24,840
Please, thank you.
- Well, see you later.

284
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,600
Did you know?
Katie Deauxma invites
me for coffee.

285
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,720
I do not think that looks like.
- What are you talking about?

286
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,040
Katie Deauxma is only quitters.

287
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,600
What has that to do with me
- I've been thinking
how to tell.

288
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,080
There is a rumor ...

289
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,360
that you're a gay
- a gay?

290
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,600
What rumor is that
- and if you are robbed ...

291
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,440
You were robbed
- I know, but ...

292
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,040
We are not beaten up, and our
clothes are not taken away.

293
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,920
That's not true.
The doctors have thrown
away my clothes.

294
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,680
Rumors mean nothing.
We know the truth.

295
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,160
Maybe you helped to fuck.

296
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,160
Not if she thinks
that he is gay.

297
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,640
Backward.
- Help me better.

298
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,440
I'm just honest.

299
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,840
I became my old self again.

300
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,400
I had of course it must stop.

301
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,040
But you can not reprogram
yourself ...

302
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,840
what you want, who you are
and your purpose in life.

303
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,400
I'm here just some.

304
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,720
It is what it is.

305
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,280
Who never saw you, h?
You better run away.

306
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,200
Maybe you should not do.

307
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,840
What?
Are you looking at me?
This is my business.

308
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,840
I am a masked mi
daadbestrijdiger.

309
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:01,200
My hardware was now made.

310
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,760
I was back, and work under
Kick Ass Version 2.0.

311
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,760
Has anyone seen Mr. Bitey?

312
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,120
Have you seen this cat?
- No.

313
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,800
Have you seen this cat?

314
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,520
Have you seen this cat?

315
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,400
Great.

316
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,960
Come here, kitty.
Come here, Mr. Bitey.

317
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,760
No, Mr. Bitey, come on.

318
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,400
Come here, I'll bring you home.

319
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,800
Get the pip, Mr. Bitey.

320
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,840
I am so sorry.
- Fucking bastard.

321
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,960
Thank you, freak.

322
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,880
Leave them alone.
- Let me go.

323
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,800
It's your business.

324
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,880
True.

325
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,680
Call 112.

326
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,240
A boy dressed as a superhero
saves a few others together.

327
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,440
It's great.

328
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,600
Leave him alone.

329
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,160
Give it up, man. Just walk away.

330
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:07,080
No, never.
- What happened to you?

331
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:11,440
Rather you die for a piece of
crap you do not even know?

332
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,600
And then three assholes who take one
tackle while everyone watches?

333
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,240
Want to know what's
wrong with me?

334
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,320
Yes, I would rather die then.
But come on.

335
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,560
You're crazy.

336
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,920
What?
- Thank you.

337
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,640
That was great. Who are you?

338
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,040
I Kick-Ass.

339
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,920
Look at this.
- What is that?

340
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,560
A costumed vigilante has become the
latest internet phenomenon ...

341
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:08,160
after someone in the Hamilton Park filmed
him during an intervention ...

342
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,880
in an attack by a gang.
- This is great.

343
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,920
Welcome to this special broadcast
of Eye on New York.

344
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,720
How far would you go to
your neighbor to help?

345
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,960
This colorful person has this
week made headlines.

346
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,240
A video of his involvement in the
violence of a street gang ...

347
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,640
was the most common clip
on the Internet.

348
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,680
38 my MySpace friends.

349
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,520
MySpace Kick Ass 16,000
and rising.

350
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,480
This went beyond all.
And I thought it was awesome.

351
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,560
We want to know who this man is.

352
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,280
Does anyone know who the father
cross-suit that is?

353
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,080
He must be someone's
son or brother ...

354
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,440
one's neighbor.
- Crikey mina.

355
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,080
What happened
- what happened? This boy.

356
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,560
Everyone now feels a superhero.
Kick-Ass.

357
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,120
I like kick-ass awesome.
- He has a terrible suit.

358
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,640
Kick-Ass is all great.

359
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,320
His clip was good.

360
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,680
He had a suit on
his ass can get.

361
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,600
Then he had himself "Kick
Ass," to call.

362
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,000
That makes no sense.

363
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,480
This is the guy his death.

364
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,520
I would email him when
I have a problem.

365
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,200
I have 100 guys who can solve a problem.
N so I do not need.

366
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,440
I do not want to interfere in your
affairs, if I'm not wanted.

367
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,840
You think I'm Kick-Ass,
but that's not me.

368
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,600
I'm very busy now.
Sorry. Later. Kick-Ass

369
00:32:53,600 --> 00:33:01,360
Hi, Dave. How about that coffee?

370
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,000
You do not read comics.
I am just started.

371
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,840
That boy had given me a few recommended
Scott Pilgrim, Sjoho Beat.

372
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,120
I'm not as familiar with
all the superhero stuff.

373
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,240
Then you're not in line for
the new comic Kick-Ass?

374
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,080
I do not think so.

375
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,640
I was really thinking about his site email.
I can help to good use.

376
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,960
Help? What then?

377
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,160
You know I am a volunteer
at the drug clinic?

378
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,040
I did not.

379
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,840
There is a boy, Rasul.
I had such a pity for him.

380
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,680
The more I heard about
his childhood ...

381
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,840
That's weird.
I'm usually the one who
plays therapist.

382
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,520
Can I confess something?

383
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:57,960
Since I was little, I always want
to have a friend like you.

384
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,760
May I say that?
That is not homophobic?

385
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,840
I do not think you're
quite the same.

386
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,000
Of course not.

387
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Thank you.

388
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:26,520
I do not know if I was what Cathy had dreamed
as a "gay best friend forever."

389
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,160
But I did my best.

390
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,360
And more importantly, I persuaded
her to Kick Ass-mail.

391
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:36,320
A long story short.
This special weakling of her ...

392
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,720
showed a more stupid cobra.

393
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,000
She wanted the money back
that they had given him.

394
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,600
Or an apology for the blue
eye that he had given her.

395
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,760
She just wanted it understood
that it was over.

396
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,040
And he left her alone.
Let's be realistic ...

397
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,320
no other request would have
done me more pleasure.

398
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,320
What do you suggest?
The green condom?

399
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,160
Halloween is only a few months.

400
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,200
I came to Rasul.

401
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,440
Who are you?
- A friend of Katie.

402
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,280
Kids today ...

403
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,720
Who of you is Rasul?

404
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:59,080
I am Rasul.
Can not you see my big tits?

405
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,400
Is it candy or I'll
shoot or something?

406
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:11,480
Now I am dead.
- I have a message for Rasul ...

407
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,520
Katie Deauxma.

408
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,960
Rasul are you?

409
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,840
Now you have to stay
away from Katie.

410
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:26,320
It's over.
Leave her alone, everything
is in order.

411
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,920
Who should you, then?

412
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,240
And what is this?
- I Kick-Ass.

413
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,920
Find it.
And I give you this by ...

414
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,520
Leave Katie alone.

415
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,960
And otherwise?

416
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:04,520
Otherwise I will return
and break your legs.

417
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,720
Come on.

418
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,640
Hold him.

419
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,600
You go there really.

420
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,440
Ok, dicks.
Let's see what you can do now.

421
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:54,440
Alpine, meeny, moe ...

422
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,240
So I have one too.

423
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,840
Come on
- You want to play?

424
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,840
This is a mieterige tazer.

425
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,280
Relax. We are on the same team.

426
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,200
Stand up.

427
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,800
Hit-Girl, we always stand
with their backs to ...

428
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,200
Against the wall, Daddy. I know.

429
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,840
It will not happen again.

430
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,680
Nice shot.
- Thank you.

431
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,440
Come on.

432
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,600
Asshole, not by the front door.

433
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,320
Wait.

434
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,720
Who are you?
- I?

435
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,840
I am Hit-Girl.

436
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,880
And that is Big Daddy.

437
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,520
Come on.

438
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,360
Come on.

439
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,200
Big Daddy and Hit-Girl.
They were the real thing.

440
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:40,200
And I was just an
idiot in a suit.

441
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,080
What am I here now?

442
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,480
Sal's phone.
This is found in his hand.

443
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,080
That he must have caught
just before he died.

444
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:06,600
This sounds crazy, but the
guy in the picture ...

445
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,680
that's crazy that
the TV superhero.

446
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,680
Who, Kick-Ass? And man?

447
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,760
If a man killed eight
of our people?

448
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Eight of Sal, in which
four children Rasul.

449
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,840
There is nothing on
the street so?

450
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,840
And man.
- I think they are.

451
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,360
If you have similar, we seem
to have a bunch of sissies.

452
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,760
What do you want me to do?

453
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:48,960
Kick-Ass I want his head on a stick.
Now.

454
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,240
I have not told anything.
I swear.

455
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,400
Good, Ass-Kick.
Let's keep it that way.

456
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,400
You know what this is?

457
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,440
That shit from your
mieterige tazertje.

458
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,880
The police here so you
can detect them.

459
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,920
Fortunately I've picked up.

460
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:22,280
Thank you.
- Say for security.

461
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,880
Now it's easier for
you to believe.

462
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,320
We can see, but we trust you.

463
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,840
Nothing personal.
We trust nobody.

464
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,160
I've checked your IP address.

465
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:38,040
It was too simple to find you.

466
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:44,760
Not considered.
I am your anything.

467
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:52,120
I wanted my site is already shut.
This is crazy.

468
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:56,600
I'm up to my neck in.
- Unfortunately, you
have potential.

469
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:00,200
Your choice.
We are nearby if you need us.

470
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,400
How can I reach
- but to call the mayor.

471
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:08,960
He has a sign in the sky shines
in the form of a dick.

472
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,800
Put on your website that you are on vacation.
We believe you.

473
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,960
Hit-Girl, back to headquarters.

474
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,320
Dreams.

475
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:27,240
You must remove Kick-Ass.
- What is it?

476
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:31,720
What is?
He makes my people off, Gigante.

477
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:39,360
Condolences, but this is
beyond my jurisdiction.

478
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,960
Your jurisdiction?
You sit in the police and
he is breaking the law.

479
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,280
He sits down to his ass
in your jurisdiction.

480
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,640
I grab criminals, you pay
me for not doing so.

481
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:55,400
The other is a gray area.
- Just do it simply.

482
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,680
Unbelievable.

483
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,040
Where's Cody? It is too late.

484
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:06,480
Thank you, Cody.
We appreciate your cooperation.

485
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:10,400
Can I look now?
I've told all the names
and addresses.

486
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:14,960
I say nothing.
Take it from who you want.

487
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:20,840
I know a lot of bad characters.
Very nasty individuals.

488
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:25,840
Do not. Come on.

489
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:31,040
Please, no.

490
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,040
What a dick.

491
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:07,600
Have you ever used self tanner?
- Yes, I always do.

492
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,880
Murder, superheroes who hack
into my bedroom ...

493
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,600
my life was a dream where
I was not awake.

494
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:19,480
Even the beautiful pieces
were unreal.

495
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:23,720
Those old Spider-Man comics
of yours were pretty good.

496
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,720
That they are.

497
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,480
I have one week of Rasul
heard nothing.

498
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,320
That's great.

499
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:32,640
There were two super agents once
called Daddy and Marcus.

500
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,520
They were good at picking
up bad guys.

501
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,200
Frank D'Amico was the worst.

502
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,560
And he devised a plan
to get rid of Daddy.

503
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,040
Search for it here.

504
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:50,800
Expose him as a drug dealer was the
worst that could happen to Daddy.

505
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,560
The prison was not his
natural environment.

506
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:01,520
He was very upset.
Police Held in jail.

507
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:05,720
Now Daddy was imprisoned,
his pregnant wife alone.

508
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:10,160
She could not.

509
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,720
But every cloud has a silver
lining, and her death ...

510
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,960
Mindy was born.
Mark was her guardian.

511
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,720
Daddy and devised a plan itself.

512
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:32,560
Five years later he
Fri he was ready.

513
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:40,160
Now there's Mindy was ready.

514
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,400
How did you find me, Marcus?
- And one of us is still a cop.

515
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:04,720
Mindy so brainwashed you
- you say that. I say a game.

516
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:10,200
A game, Damon?
Own right play, mass murder?

517
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,680
Where is she
- she is safe.

518
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:18,320
Can I see her? I miss her.

519
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:24,000
I miss you both.
- I do appreciate your concern.

520
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:28,360
But you have to go now.

521
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:35,200
I must warn you that Gigante
to Kick-Ass is looking for.

522
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:40,520
Does that have anything to do with you?
A cut superhero club
or something?

523
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:44,120
Never heard of.
- You've been warned.

524
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:48,520
If you go you will
find him soon.

525
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:53,000
He has worked for D'Amico
you that since declined.

526
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:55,960
You know I do not lose.

527
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:02,040
Not until D'Amico and his whole
operation have become ashes.

528
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,000
And buried.

529
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:10,400
As you get her back.
This is Mindy's life.

530
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,480
You owe her a childhood.

531
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,920
I'll tell you who it
is owed a youth?

532
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,720
Frank D'Amico.

533
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,880
I do not believe this.

534
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:52,080
Follow him around the corner.
Not so fast.

535
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:59,440
Why the hands? I will give him.

536
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:05,760
What nonsense.
Continue to follow him.
Not too close.

537
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:15,000
He goes into the alley.

538
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:19,160
Stop when I tell you. Ready?

539
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,120
How are you?

540
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:31,720
My men finish? Steal my coke?

541
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:36,120
What are you doing? We gotta go.

542
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:39,520
Frank, he is not worth it.
Come on.

543
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,720
Where do you look to now?

544
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:58,440
Come on.

545
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,840
Step.

546
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:11,600
He was so young.
He did not deserve to die so.

547
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,400
I can not believe he's dead.

548
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,360
I know.

549
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:22,920
Katie, like Rasul men caught
up in things ...

550
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,600
If it was my fault?
To Kick-Ass it's done?

551
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:31,720
Should I call the police?
- You talk nonsense.

552
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,840
He has your e-mail may
never have read.

553
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,480
Do not worry.

554
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:42,240
I'm glad you're here.
I'm a wreck.

555
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:47,200
It's okay. No problem.
- You're amazing.

556
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:53,000
Hopefully I can say this, it's
so fucking gay that you are.

557
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,400
Kick-Ass impersonator killed
- Unbelievable.

558
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:04,480
What the hell is that
for comedian.

559
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:11,000
A Spider-Man party for children,
good, but a kick-ass party?

560
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,880
They even sell paper plates
and napkins in the store?

561
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,560
Frank, you're scaring me.

562
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:19,560
When you make your
hands dirty again?

563
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:25,040
You had to deliver kick-ass, so ...
- We have been working one week.

564
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:28,280
We have emailed him.
Half the team is bait.

565
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,520
We work us out of the seam.
What are you doing?

566
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,840
Use your stuff back?

567
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:39,360
"Mommy, I want a kick-ass party.
Stupid children.

568
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:42,160
I know how you can catch him.

569
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:45,600
How long are you there?
On Thurs.

570
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,560
Want to hear
- hear what?

571
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:54,480
You're a superhero and lonely,
you can not trust anyone ...

572
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,960
He reads comic books all day.

573
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:00,640
A super hero but in a
strange way n trust.

574
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:03,920
I can be that strange.
Give me a chance.

575
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:09,080
I just have a few things.
- What?

576
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,720
This is what I need.

577
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,520
Is this a joke? What's this?

578
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,440
Everything I need.

579
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:24,080
Maybe someone there rags.
Louie or something.

580
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:28,320
Or someone else.
- Tony.

581
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,760
I hate Tony.
- Tony is an asshole.

582
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:35,080
I swear this will work.

583
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,200
Tony Romeda, one of America's
wanted criminals ...

584
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,520
is arrested today in Queens.
After a call from someone ...

585
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,000
who claimed to be
a superhero ...

586
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,840
How's Katie?

587
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,960
Great. I sleep ...

588
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,960
and we have all night to
look Ugly Betty ...

589
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,720
other's nails done.

590
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,560
The longer you wait,
the worse it gets.

591
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:07,560
I would tell her, but
she is so happy.

592
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,240
This is your chance.

593
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,440
Did she see it?

594
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:18,960
Have you watched TV,
the new super hero?

595
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:22,840
Look. Can something harder?

596
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:27,840
But this individual, who
called Red Mist ...

597
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,160
Crime is at a new level ...

598
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,280
as he showed last night.
What did you say?

599
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,000
They do not want to
live in fear ...

600
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:39,240
Kick-Ass and proves that n individuals
can change anything.

601
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:42,560
If someone need help, I am
every week usable ...

602
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,680
with just one click
on redmist.org.

603
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,760
Will it matter?

604
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,400
What is so special about him?

605
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:53,200
He has a big drug
dealer arrested.

606
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,280
And a lot of drugs found.
- That's pretty cool.

607
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:01,520
And he has a better costume.
- And a cape. Those are cool.

608
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,560
Cape that allows him well.

609
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:09,080
Better than Kick Ass
- They are both good ...

610
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:12,000
but Red Mist has a better body.
Do not you?

611
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:22,960
Yes, Dave. Nothing for you, all that leather?
- He's not really my type.

612
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,440
Say what Red Mist.

613
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:18,680
Kick-Ass.
- Red Mist.

614
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,520
That hurt.

615
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,600
All right
- all right.

616
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:29,200
You are here. You're my hero.

617
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:33,320
You have inspired me.
No Kick-Ass Red Mist no.

618
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,400
Really?
- Sure.

619
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:42,760
If you want me ... get your assistant
- my assistant?

620
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:46,680
You and I can handle everything.

621
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,880
Want to fight crime
- now?

622
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,320
I want to show you something.

623
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:58,760
I normally work only between
two and nine.

624
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:02,240
I should be back.

625
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,120
Great.

626
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,720
Is this yours?
- See Mist Mobile.

627
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:25,080
GPS, iPhone for the site's
emergency move ...

628
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:30,280
what mood lighting.
Rear view cameras,
nothing special.

629
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,640
And you'll love this.

630
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,240
The fog.

631
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:45,280
Therefore we are superheroes.
They love us.

632
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,800
Smoking?

633
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,800
Cannabis extracts the
stress a little.

634
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,680
That gang is a bit scary, right?

635
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:06,000
Is there anything
- you're different
than I thought.

636
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:16,080
I have received an email from a girl.
She says that someone follows
her from her work.

637
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:20,840
I have her address. Would you look
- why not.

638
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:34,840
We're naked, they sit on my lap,
I ask what was in her mind.

639
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:48,440
He is on the way.
- Very well.

640
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:51,680
Do not call him before
I get there.

641
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,880
Comics still have something
delivered.

642
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,120
Your boy has done well.

643
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:06,840
He resembles his father.

644
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,200
Almost forgot.

645
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:51,120
What is that?

646
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,640
Do you:
- There are people in there.

647
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:02,920
Should we fire ...

648
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,600
Red Mist.

649
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:34,000
Red Mist.

650
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:43,000
Can you hear me?

651
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:01,480
Where are you?

652
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:37,720
We have to leave. Hurry.

653
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:59,960
Did you see that look?
- Yes.

654
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:05,720
Why you saved the bear
- What?

655
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,360
No idea, come on.

656
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,920
And?

657
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:24,840
What are you doing?
You know I can not be.

658
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:29,320
What is it?
- Kick-Ass burned down
my warehouse.

659
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:33,840
Calm. Kick-Ass
- You gotta help me.

660
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:36,160
My son was there.
He is still missing.

661
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,720
They're all dead!

662
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,320
Everybody from the
warehouse, dead!

663
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,600
Weapon away. It's Chris.

664
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:45,920
Chris Red Mist?

665
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:48,600
Make you more worried
about Kick-Ass.

666
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:51,360
No, he's just a nerd.

667
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:55,200
Do not worry about him.
Look at this.

668
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,600
What does it do?
- Really now?

669
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:02,000
Put you down.

670
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,080
What are you doing?
What is that?

671
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:11,880
You bought it to spy on
the nanny, remember?

672
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,120
You placed in the warehouse?

673
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:17,200
Yeah, I thought it was cool to the
unmasking of Kick-Ass online.

674
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,320
Look.

675
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:51,920
Who is that guy?
- No idea, Dad.

676
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:55,360
Kick-Ass said we were
not the only heroes.

677
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:57,880
Maybe he knows who this guy is.

678
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:04,440
Close this place down.
Nobody comes in or out.

679
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:10,640
Until somebody shoots
asshole mess.

680
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:18,600
They sit on your heels.
You hear me?

681
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:21,040
I thought she looked
Kick-Ass ...

682
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:26,280
Not anymore.
Gigante wants us to
find another hero.

683
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:29,320
He has a warehouse in a lot
of D'Amico's people killed.

684
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,960
That was you sure?

685
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:34,240
I had the cameras turned off.
- Apparently not.

686
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:38,440
You must hide as soon
as possible.

687
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:40,480
I appreciate it.

688
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,280
Mindy ...

689
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:48,120
No more homework ...

690
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:51,560
it is time to go bye
bye Frank D'Amico.

691
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:01,320
X-Men, Fantastic Four ...

692
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:04,200
now I save them rotten.

693
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:08,360
Nothing was still under control.
What should I do?

694
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:11,520
Is it? You look tired.

695
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:14,880
Early to bed tonight
- I could talk with anyone.

696
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:18,640
Hi
- Yeah, sure.

697
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:23,400
I never felt more alone.

698
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:31,840
I always wanted to show a super hero.
But this was a nightmare.

699
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:39,320
It was time to let that
ridiculous costume.

700
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,400
But there remains
for me one thing.

701
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,840
What is the difference between
Spider-Man and Peter Parker?

702
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:54,560
Spider-Man gets the girl.

703
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,680
Hi!

704
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:10,560
I Kick Ass, You had emailed me?

705
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:18,600
What do you do, go
from my house!

706
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:22,240
I'm going to hurt you, I am!

707
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:24,760
I just wanted to surprise you.

708
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:27,160
Dave? What are you doing?

709
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:30,040
Why are you dressed like Kick-Ass
- Kick-Ass I bn.

710
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:33,920
What are you talking about
- I'm not gay.

711
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:40,640
I'm an idiot who lied to you.
I know.

712
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:44,040
If you feel better through it,
you can not hate me ...

713
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:45,920
than I hate myself.

714
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:48,760
Please ...

715
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:52,200
I'm so sorry.

716
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:57,600
I've met anyone so lovely ...

717
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:00,200
than you.

718
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:24,680
Dave.
- Yeah?

719
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:29,760
The alarm is probably on,
so bring the window.

720
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,800
Or ...

721
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:43,200
you can just continue.

722
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:45,640
Continue?

723
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:48,720
Sleep would be great.

724
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:57,160
Sorry, I didn 't mean
to scare you.

725
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:33,320
We have to, do it and what
it is established.

726
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,320
I have something, I think.

727
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:38,400
He is perfect, they can
deliver in three days.

728
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:46,720
They need $ 1000.
- Can you spend on
anything else?

729
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:50,480
That's cool!
- Yes.

730
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:54,080
Add to shopping card.
- Okay.

731
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:59,680
Kick-Ass and battle between
Red Mist, who would win?

732
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:02,360
Why fight it?
That just seems stupid.

733
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,960
What do you think?
- Kick-Ass was cuter.

734
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:08,160
Really?

735
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:12,360
I would sew his brains out
if I had the chance.

736
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:16,600
Really?
- Absolutely.

737
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:22,880
Want to see the new Kate Hudson movie?
The following display.

738
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,920
Absolutely.

739
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:29,520
We're apparently not invited.

740
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:34,200
Come here, I can now convert
to a strip reader.

741
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:39,040
I finally understood why superhero
comics only existed.

742
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:42,000
I understood why people gave
their lives to strangers.

743
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:46,760
Since I first in my life I
had something to live for.

744
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:49,520
Something to lose.

745
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,720
Katie was worried about me.

746
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,840
I promised her that my Kick-Ass
days were over.

747
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:58,640
And actually I barely missed.

748
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:02,080
I had the website up
to show week view.

749
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:07,080
I'm off then.

750
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:12,760
Katie does not pass
- Tomorrow, Wednesday Volunteer.

751
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:18,680
You look like a different person.
Your mother would
have been proud.

752
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,120
Dude.
What are you doing? I must meet you!
Red Mist

753
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:34,400
Hi, sweetheart.
- What's happening?

754
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:37,640
I need a kick-ass thing.
- What?

755
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:41,440
Thus, you were stopped?
- Last, I promise.

756
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:45,040
I'm worried about you.

757
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:49,120
Do not it.
- That is impossible,
because ...

758
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:53,240
I like very much to you.

759
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:58,520
I also like about you.

760
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:30,920
Hopefully this seriously, because I promised
my friend that this was done.

761
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:33,520
We are both dead.
Is that serious enough?

762
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,640
Dead? How?

763
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:41,680
Who killed the store have friends
who see us as a perpetrator.

764
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:46,320
There is a price on our heads.
- Is this the Wild
West or something?

765
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:51,880
I do not laugh, they know where I
live, and I'm fucking screwed.

766
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,920
All right.

767
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,360
Damn.

768
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:00,680
What do we do?

769
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:07,280
Remember when there were other heroes
- Yes.

770
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:10,280
You think they can help us?

771
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:21,400
Hot chocolate, extra
marshmallows.

772
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:27,200
It looks even better
than the picture.

773
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:31,920
These photo were not
machine guns.

774
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:34,800
Nice work. I take mine to bed.

775
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:37,960
Okay, baby. Sleep well.
- Thank you.

776
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:40,240
Kick-Ass?

777
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:43,440
Get dressed, we met
him at address B.

778
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:44,880
We drink our hot chocolate
when we get back.

779
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:59,280
Look.
- Do you know where that is?

780
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:02,720
No, I put it in the GPS.
- Go ahead.

781
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:05,920
Damn.

782
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:50,960
Well, here you are.
And Red Mist too.

783
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:58,920
Pleasant.
- Nice, sir.

784
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,160
Come in, please.
- After you.

785
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:07,800
Hit-Girl, your manners.

786
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,880
Hi, I'm Hit-Girl.

787
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:27,160
He's with me.
- Shut up, your father
is the boss.

788
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:31,120
He's with me. Let him go.

789
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:36,000
So one I always wanted to have.
- Do you do it?

790
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:45,480
If you love to be like a superhero ...
- That's funny ...

791
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:48,640
Get him outta here.

792
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:53,160
Kick-Ass sorry.

793
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:09,880
Why not absolve you
this motherfucker?

794
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:12,120
Ignore him ...

795
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:14,320
a Bazooka?

796
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:19,080
We had a deal pap ...

797
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:22,600
I would care for the man who did it,
if you let go now Kick-Ass ...

798
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:25,080
He has done nothing wrong.

799
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:27,480
Check this out from my side ...

800
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:30,080
I need people to send a message.

801
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:33,360
Which superhero are bad
for your health ...

802
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:35,800
and that big bastard
who nobody knows.

803
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:38,680
That is not fair.
- Life is not fair, forget it.

804
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:42,280
What do you do to them?

805
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:45,280
Do you really know?

806
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:51,120
Yes.
- Sit down, shut up and watch.

807
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:02,280
Frank we are ready. Enjoy.

808
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:06,600
Did you see the control.
- Indeed, look and learn.

809
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:10,160
Welcome back to the worldwide web
broadcast with shocking news ...

810
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:12,800
about the superhero from New
York, known as Kick-Ass ...

811
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:18,000
will appear as live.
According to rumors, this will
be his last performance ...

812
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:20,560
and that he will stop
fighting evil.

813
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:23,640
As the news spreads,
thinking ISPs ...

814
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:28,440
that this might be the most watched moment
in the history of the Internet can be.

815
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:29,480
Where is Dave really?
- There is no i
dication that ...

816
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:32,920
Have you also heard that ...

817
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:35,600
By Katie, probably.

818
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:38,200
Why should I be different.

819
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:41,400
Nobody knows yet who is behind the
broadcast of this show is ...

820
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:44,400
it is heard in many
server crashes ...

821
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:47,400
Dave, why did you not say.
You're on the news.

822
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:51,680
Call me.
- The next to the clock
that counts down.

823
01:19:51,680 --> 01:20:06,200
Showtime.

824
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:10,120
Hello, boys and girls ...

825
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:13,320
you know who this is ...

826
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:16,440
This man here is Big Daddy.

827
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:20,320
These are all my friends.
Come say hello guys.

828
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,120
There they are al Hello.

829
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:27,360
Big Daddy and Kick-Ass
will help us ...

830
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:31,760
to show you why a hero
is a bad idea.

831
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:34,800
Do you know what a silent K? That's when the word starts with a K.
..

832
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:37,080
but you do not pronounce.

833
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:41,080
As to the Knock-out word.
And you get a box with handle.

834
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:44,840
That was certainly painful.
We look at it from
a different angle.

835
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:51,440
That was really painful.
In French they say so "Baton".

836
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:54,160
We have stakes of Kick-Ass, we
will show you what they can.

837
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:56,080
Go your way guys.

838
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:02,760
In America we say this to
a stick, 'Baseball Bat'.

839
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:07,160
Good for hitting on
knees or head ...

840
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:10,200
also good to use someone
in the balls to hit.

841
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:14,840
But we do not individually,
but all at once.

842
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:16,800
Gentlemen, get your swing.

843
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:19,760
This looks very painful out.

844
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,600
Given the shocking images ...

845
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:28,560
we can no longer broadcast
live internet images.

846
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:36,520
Despite speculation that this would
be a publicity stunt ...

847
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:39,640
it is now clear that the
hostages indeed at risk.

848
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:44,200
With the intention to show a live
broadcast of an execution.

849
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:00,480
Even with my metal plates
and broken my nervous ...

850
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:04,320
I can say that pretty painful.

851
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:09,240
Kerosene, the silent killer.

852
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:12,840
But not half as painful as the thought that
I should leave everything behind ...

853
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:17,840
Katie, my father, Todd
and Marty ...

854
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:20,480
and all these things
I've done ...

855
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:25,520
like driving a car, or know how
our children will be ...

856
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:28,160
Lost or how it ends.

857
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:33,120
And if you think I get it because
I'm talking to you ...

858
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:36,240
Do not be such a smartass.

859
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:40,600
You've never seen Sin City,
or Sunset Boulevard?

860
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:42,440
American Beauty?

861
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:48,560
This, beyond all t
oglodytes, is fire.

862
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:00,520
Fire. Fire is good.

863
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:03,640
Fire is our friend.

864
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,760
Gentlemen ...

865
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:16,160
time to die right there.

866
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,880
What the hell ...

867
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:20,640
Pick up the lighter.

868
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:47,440
Take cover.

869
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:52,760
Use kryptonite.

870
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,240
This show is over, assholes.

871
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:23,960
I think I love her.

872
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,080
She looks like she was
only eleven years ...

873
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:30,240
I wait on her.

874
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:32,560
That will be very
difficult for you.

875
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:34,960
Is everything okay?
- Yes.

876
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:56,080
Well done.

877
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:05,840
I'm so proud of you.

878
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:09,680
Is everything okay?

879
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:18,840
Shot down was less painful
than when you did.

880
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:23,920
I used ball with less speed.

881
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:32,880
You are the sweetest dad in the world.
- No, I'm ...

882
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:34,920
I love you.

883
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:43,040
Love you, Dad.

884
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:52,720
Love you, Dad.

885
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:55,160
Sleep tight.

886
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:16,320
What's your name?
Your real name?

887
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:19,440
A superhero never reveals
his true identity.

888
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:23,000
But you can not ...

889
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:26,640
How you do this also
have lived ...

890
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:30,400
it's over.

891
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:35,240
Is there anyone else?
Family or something ...

892
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:37,920
I can take care of myself ...

893
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,720
I've also saved you anyway.

894
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:45,000
And money?
You also need long-term
thinking.

895
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:47,600
I have about 3 million
in this case ...

896
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:51,400
is that enough for
the long term?

897
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:55,920
It is not just about
the money ...

898
01:28:56,360 --> 01:28:58,600
I stand with you in debt.

899
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:02,080
If you had not been there,
I was now dead.

900
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:05,280
If you had not been there ...

901
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:09,280
My father would be alive.

902
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:29,920
Take note what you need and
then we go to my house.

903
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:35,480
I'm just fine.
- Go ahead.

904
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:30,360
I meant your pajamas
and your clothes ...

905
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:32,080
you can not take it to my house.

906
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:35,200
You know what my dad really
would have wanted?

907
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:42,040
That I finished what we started.

908
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:46,080
I will do that.

909
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:03,880
Is this the home of
Frank D'Amico?

910
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:07,800
All that security,
are you crazy?

911
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:10,240
My mother has already
died for nothing ...

912
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:14,600
So I'll leave that to
my father not happen.

913
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:18,760
You can not succeed alone.

914
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:22,320
Exactly.

915
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:26,560
Want to blame my father's honor?

916
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:30,800
Keep your mouth shut
and choose a weapon.

917
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:42,560
Is that what I think it is?
- Yes, certainly.

918
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:45,920
Read the manual but ...

919
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:49,320
who do you need so much.

920
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:58,600
Look, you have 5 minutes and then
I want you back to your post ...

921
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:01,720
and let this tidy.

922
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:17,160
Everything
- everything is fine.

923
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:22,200
I got my gun back. ... It is not

924
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:29,360
Let her inside.

925
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:34,360
It was a small child.
What do you think?

926
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:39,920
Is it, dear?

927
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:44,040
I lost my mom and dad.

928
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:46,520
She lost her mom and dad.

929
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:49,400
Want my phone?

930
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:52,960
You know the song?

931
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:39,480
If I were a super hero, it was for me
the world is no more to offer ...

932
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:43,640
than good intentions
and a good stamina.

933
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:48,880
Without power, there is
no responsibility.

934
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:53,200
Except that it was not true.

935
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:21,000
Kenny, help me.

936
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:28,360
Everyone is dead.

937
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:32,560
She sits behind the counter,
and she has no more bullets.

938
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:48,560
Do you think they
have her address?

939
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:51,160
If they failed, then
it will succeed.

940
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:56,040
Go to it.
- Now?

941
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:07,680
What's going on here?

942
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:09,360
She is trapped, and
she is unarmed.

943
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:11,760
What are you waiting for?

944
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:16,560
Go get her.
- I have no weapon.

945
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:20,280
Now.

946
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:44,880
I get the bazooka.

947
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:48,360
Bazooka?

948
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:53,160
Only me.
Everything is under control.

949
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:08,920
Under control, why
pick up a bazooka?

950
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:15,520
Go ahead.

951
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:37,440
This is what I always
wanted to say.

952
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:41,840
Say hello to my little friend.

953
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:14,280
Die, motherfuckers.

954
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:50,520
That was a weird sound
for a bazooka.

955
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:08,440
Catch them.

956
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:18,880
The playtime is over.

957
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:21,760
I never play.

958
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:24,280
Really?

959
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:40,720
Runeren my case?

960
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:44,640
Everyone on my payroll finish.

961
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:15,560
I had a son like you.

962
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:24,000
Time for a family Renie.

963
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:29,360
Pick someone your own size from.

964
01:42:48,040 --> 01:42:50,920
Will it work
- Yes.

965
01:42:51,560 --> 01:42:53,720
Time to go home.

966
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:27,600
Thanks, Kick-Ass.

967
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:29,600
My dad ...

968
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:33,920
would have been proud of us.

969
01:44:43,640 --> 01:44:46,960
Dave Lizewski.

970
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:49,840
I know, loser.

971
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:01,640
Mindy ...

972
01:45:02,240 --> 01:45:04,240
Mindy Macready.

973
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,120
Goodbye.

974
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:27,640
Mindy went to live with Mark,
who came to my school ...

975
01:45:29,560 --> 01:45:33,240
its first school ever.
And so I could watch her ...

976
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:37,080
not necessary.

977
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:39,080
Hey, rookie.

978
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:43,240
Your lunch money now.

979
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:53,560
Kick-Ass was gone but
not forgotten.

980
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:57,960
And my world was much safer with
all the new superheroes ...

981
01:45:58,600 --> 01:46:00,800
They said I was their
inspiration ...

982
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:05,720
I have only the door of
my dream world open ...

983
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:09,240
a world with only superhero.

984
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,080
As a great man once said ...

985
01:46:15,720 --> 01:46:18,280
wait until they charge me see.
