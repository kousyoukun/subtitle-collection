

1
00:00:15,347 --> 00:00:19,007
海 扁 王

2
00:00:26,973 --> 00:00:31,592
他是宇宙的保护者 反对邪恶势力
Guardian of the Universe. Protector against the forces of evil

3
00:00:31,627 --> 00:00:33,897
他可以拦截子弹 速度比火车还快
He can catch a bullet, faster than a speeding train.

4
00:00:33,932 --> 00:00:36,406
轻易地在高楼大厦间穿行
He leaps tall buildings in a single bound.

5
00:00:36,441 --> 00:00:39,334
在天上的 是鸟还是飞机
Up in the sky. Is it a bird, is it a plane?

6
00:00:39,369 --> 00:00:42,193
白天是邮递员 晚上是超级英雄
...Mailman by day, superhero by night.

7
00:00:42,228 --> 00:00:44,977
保护纽约 免受邪恶势力的骚扰
He protects New York from the forces of evil.

8
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:48,265
非凡勇士们保护世界
... The World has been protected by extraordinary men and women

9
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,726
严惩罪恶
who have dedicated themselves to fighting crime.

10
00:00:52,467 --> 00:00:56,972
他的能力已经远远超越凡人
He has powers far beyond the capabilities of mere earthlings.

11
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:10,047
我一直在想为什么先前没人尝试过
I always wondered why nobody did it before me

12
00:01:12,967 --> 00:01:16,773
我是说 像那些漫画书 电影 电视剧里
I mean, all those comic books. Movies. TV shows...

13
00:01:16,808 --> 00:01:18,250
总会有些古怪宅男
You'd think that one eccentric loner

14
00:01:18,285 --> 00:01:19,692
为自己订做服装
would have made himself a costume.

15
00:01:22,622 --> 00:01:25,354
难道每天的生活真有那么精彩
Is everyday life really so exciting,

16
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,634
学习和工作真那么刺激
are schools and offices so thrilling,

17
00:01:27,669 --> 00:01:30,349
难道只有我在幻想当英雄吗
that I'm the only one who ever fantasized about this?

18
00:01:31,882 --> 00:01:33,936
算了吧 别不承认
C'mon. Be honest with yourself.

19
00:01:34,853 --> 00:01:36,664
在生活的某个瞬间
At some point in our lives,

20
00:01:36,699 --> 00:01:39,337
我们都想成为超级英雄
we all wanted to be a super hero.

21
00:01:54,727 --> 00:01:56,667
那不是我
That's not me, by the way.

22
00:01:57,178 --> 00:02:00,702
那是个有点精神问题的亚美尼亚疯子
That's some Armenian guy with a history of mental health problems.

23
00:02:01,932 --> 00:02:03,132
我是谁
Who am I?

24
00:02:03,862 --> 00:02:05,196
我是海扁王
I'm "Kick - Ass"

25
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,035
六个月前
Six months earlier

26
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:18,950
那是我 回到我最初的平凡生活
That's me. Back before any of this crazy shit happened.

27
00:02:20,034 --> 00:02:23,537
你肯定猜不到我可以变成超级英雄
Guess I was the last person you'd expect to become a superhero

28
00:02:24,893 --> 00:02:27,020
不是说我有什么缺陷
Not saying there was anything wrong with me.

29
00:02:27,823 --> 00:02:29,648
但是我也很普通
But there's not nothing special either

30
00:02:30,962 --> 00:02:32,564
我不爱运动
I wasn't into sports

31
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:35,581
数学不好 游戏也不行
I wasn't a mathlete... or a hard - core gamer...

32
00:02:36,144 --> 00:02:39,314
我没有穿孔 没有饮食失调
I didn't have a piercing, or an eating disorder,

33
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:41,677
也没有3000个空间朋友
or three thousand friends on MySpace.

34
00:02:41,712 --> 00:02:45,299
唯一擅长的是被女生无视
My only superpower was being invisible to girls

35
00:02:46,143 --> 00:02:49,251
在朋友眼中 我也不是有趣的人
But out of my friends, man, I wasn't even the funny one.

36
00:02:50,262 --> 00:02:53,286
就像许多同龄人 我只是活着罢了
Like most people my age, I just existed.

37
00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:05,597
早上好 同学们
Good morning, class

38
00:03:05,632 --> 00:03:09,375
请把书翻到第二幕 第二场
Please open your books to act II, scene II

39
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,525
推门进来看 我可能在看电视
Kick in my bedroom door, you'ld probably find me watching TV.

40
00:03:14,338 --> 00:03:16,533
或者在skype跟托德聊天
Or talking to my friend Todd on Skype.

41
00:03:16,568 --> 00:03:18,728
- 你在看"恶搞之家"吗 - 没有
- You watching Family Guy? - Nope.

42
00:03:18,763 --> 00:03:19,631
我也没
Me neither.

43
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:23,003
上"甜甜咪咪网"看看吧 很带劲
try "hardnipplesweat.com...It's good

44
00:03:26,027 --> 00:03:29,145
或者打飞机 多亏了我的英文老师
Or "jerking off". Mostly to my English teacher

45
00:03:30,584 --> 00:03:33,826
戴夫・莱泽斯基 别以为我不知道
David Lizewski, don't think I haven't noticed

46
00:03:33,861 --> 00:03:35,599
你在盯着我胸看
you looking at my tits?

47
00:03:37,153 --> 00:03:41,647
快来抚摸我 戴夫
Oh!...I want your hand all over me...Dave...please

48
00:03:43,148 --> 00:03:45,564
上学期间当然不能真刀真枪
Sure a lot of what got me through the average school day

49
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,206
但是为我的课后性福提供了真枪实弹
was making deposits in the wack - off warehouse for later

50
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:52,762
其实我的需求也不算多
Though, to be honest I didn't take much to set me off.

51
00:03:54,357 --> 00:03:56,950
我发誓 如果荷尔蒙平衡的话
I swear, when hormones balance out

52
00:03:56,985 --> 00:03:59,821
纸巾的销量会极速下跌
shares in Kleenex are gonna take a dive, man.

53
00:04:00,582 --> 00:04:02,751
不是的 海扁王只是个小丑
No it's not. Kick - Ass is just some geek!

54
00:04:03,502 --> 00:04:05,229
戴夫・莱泽斯基
Dave Lizewski

55
00:04:05,264 --> 00:04:07,162
你不是应该专注于"哈姆雷特"上面吗
Shouldn't you be looking at Hamlet right now?

56
00:04:07,621 --> 00:04:08,987
嗯 泽老师
Yes, Mrs. Zane

57
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,209
不好意思
Sorry

58
00:04:13,908 --> 00:04:14,864
但是别误会我
But don't make me wrong

59
00:04:14,899 --> 00:04:16,838
我也爱同龄的女生
I like girls in my own age, too.

60
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:19,998
特别是凯蒂・狄克斯莫
Especially Katie Deauxma.

61
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:20,967
嗨 美人儿
Hey gorgeous!

62
00:04:21,864 --> 00:04:22,719
嗨
Hey!

63
00:04:26,264 --> 00:04:27,505
啊, 不是
Oh, No

64
00:04:28,725 --> 00:04:30,685
你是叫爱瑞卡
you meant Erika

65
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,153
我知道的
I know. I knew that.

66
00:04:33,188 --> 00:04:34,564
我只是开个玩笑而已
I was just kidding.

67
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:36,869
好吧
O.K., cool.

68
00:04:37,776 --> 00:04:38,912
天啊
oh, my God

69
00:04:42,906 --> 00:04:44,731
看 我是托德的妈妈
Hey, look I'm Todd's mom.

70
00:04:45,262 --> 00:04:49,246
好好笑 我是你爸
Oh, that's funny, this is your dad

71
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:51,686
不是 还是我妈
No That's still my mom, actually

72
00:04:54,657 --> 00:04:55,690
我操
what the fuck?

73
00:04:56,138 --> 00:04:58,022
我只是个平凡人
I was just a regular guy.

74
00:04:58,057 --> 00:05:03,114
没有毒蜘蛛 不是流亡地球的外星人
No radioactive spiders. No refugee status from a doomed alien world.

75
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:06,346
你知道吗 托德说这早餐麦片还在生产
You know what? Todd said they do still make Count Chocula.

76
00:05:06,381 --> 00:05:08,140
只是不在商店里卖了
They just don't sell it in the store anymore.

77
00:05:10,725 --> 00:05:13,238
我妈妈突然死在厨房, 死因是动脉瘤
My mother was killed by an aneurism in the kitchen,

78
00:05:13,273 --> 00:05:15,626
而不是在某条小巷被枪杀
as opposed to a gunman in an alley.

79
00:05:16,085 --> 00:05:20,589
所以我也没机会说出 我要为你报仇 妈妈
So if you were hoping for any...I will avenge you, mother!

80
00:05:20,624 --> 00:05:21,868
然而 不幸的是
...You're outta luck.

81
00:05:21,903 --> 00:05:24,068
我妈妈去世的18个月里
In fact, in the eighteen months since my mother died,

82
00:05:24,103 --> 00:05:28,055
我明白了 日子还是一样过
the only epiphany I had was realizing that, life just goes on.

83
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,130
他们换包装了吗
Did they change the bee's face?

84
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,247
没
No

85
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:43,025
为什么没人尝试当超级英雄
How come nobody's ever tried to be a superhero?

86
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,455
不清楚 或许根本不可能
well, I dunno. Probably 'cause it's fucking impossible, dip - shit.

87
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,817
为什么 戴个面具拯救人类 有什么难的
What, putting on a mask and helping people? How is that impossible?

88
00:05:49,852 --> 00:05:52,023
那不是超级英雄 你必须要有超能力
That's not a superhero, though. It has to have Super

89
00:05:52,058 --> 00:05:54,644
你要变得很强大 能飞 能打
Super is like, being stronger than everybody and flying and shit.

90
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:55,548
那才是英雄
That's just hero.

91
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,555
不是 那不是英雄 只是个疯子
No, It's not even hero, it's just fuckin' psycho.

92
00:05:59,086 --> 00:06:00,848
那布鲁斯・韦恩呢(蝙蝠侠的真实身份)
Hello? Bruce Wayne?

93
00:06:00,883 --> 00:06:02,096
他也没有超能力
He didn't have any powers.

94
00:06:02,131 --> 00:06:04,432
但是人家有银子买装备
Yeah, but he had all expensive shit that doesn't exist.

95
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:06,875
我知道你的意思 为什么没人这么做
I thought you meant, like how come no one does it in real life.

96
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,258
是的 我就是那个意思
Yeah, Todd, that's what I meant.

97
00:06:08,293 --> 00:06:11,036
现实就是 这样做会被海扁的
Dude if anybody did it in real life they'd get their ass kicked.

98
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:13,045
说不定过不了一天就死了
They'd be dead in like, a day...A day.

99
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,984
我不是说他们应该这样
O.K., I'm not saying they should do it.

100
00:06:15,019 --> 00:06:17,382
我只是不明白为什么没人尝试
I just can't figure out why nobody does.

101
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:20,973
而且有这么多人追捧超级英雄
Seriously, out of all the millions of people who love superheroes

102
00:06:21,008 --> 00:06:23,215
为什么不去试试
you'd think one would give it a try.

103
00:06:24,101 --> 00:06:26,235
你不觉得很奇怪吗
Jesus, guys. Doesn't it bug you?

104
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,157
为什么大家都想成为帕里斯・希尔顿
Why do thousands of people wanna be Paris Hilton,

105
00:06:28,192 --> 00:06:29,425
却没有人想成为蜘蛛侠
and nobody wants to be Spider - Man?

106
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,265
是啊, 她的胸部就是一飞机场
Yeah, what's with that? She has, like, no tits at all.

107
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,893
可能是性爱录影带吧 蜘蛛侠没有这个
Maybe it's the porn tape. He doesn't have a porn tape.

108
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:37,010
你没看过"蜘蛛侠的激情夜"吧
You never saw One Night in Spider - Man?

109
00:06:39,596 --> 00:06:40,993
谁来了
Guess who?

110
00:06:44,851 --> 00:06:48,120
你们难道不觉得克里斯・阿米克很可怜吗
Is it just me, or do you feel kinda sorry for Chris D'Amico?

111
00:06:48,155 --> 00:06:51,389
有个有钱的老爸 要什么有什么
Yeah, must be terrible to have a rich dad and everything you want.

112
00:06:51,424 --> 00:06:52,177
别说了
I wish you hadn't said anything.

113
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:54,579
我都快哭了
'Cause I feel like I'm gonna start crying.

114
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,202
本来就是
No, the fact that it

115
00:06:56,237 --> 00:06:57,718
他总是独自一人
Yeh, but he's always on his own.

116
00:06:59,511 --> 00:07:02,104
我们应该 跟他聊聊
We should, like, talk to him.

117
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:03,626
看看他想不想跟我们一起玩
See if he wants to hang with us.

118
00:07:03,661 --> 00:07:05,434
我不是这个意思 只是
... I'm not saying that we should talk to him, but

119
00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:06,911
想想这样也不错
Think about it. C'mon it'll be awesome!

120
00:07:06,946 --> 00:07:10,022
跟他做朋友就没人敢欺负我们了
If he was our friend, no one would ever fuck with us again!

121
00:07:10,057 --> 00:07:11,169
快去 托德
Go on then, Todd.

122
00:07:11,847 --> 00:07:13,265
不 你是说让我去吗
No, no, What you mean? Want me to talk to him?

123
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,712
呃 应该让戴夫去
Nuh - uh. Dave should go. Dave should go.

124
00:07:16,747 --> 00:07:19,667
为什么 戴夫 绝对是你 去吧
Why? Dave you should totally go. Go.

125
00:07:19,702 --> 00:07:20,720
别害怕 戴夫
Do not be afraid Dave

126
00:07:20,755 --> 00:07:21,690
没用的家伙
You are a pussy

127
00:07:29,322 --> 00:07:30,449
滚开
Fuck off.

128
00:07:36,517 --> 00:07:38,077
- 吓傻了? - 是啊
- Wanna go over there? - Yeah

129
00:07:38,112 --> 00:07:40,240
我吓得都快尿裤子了
You think I just shat my pants or what?

130
00:07:43,086 --> 00:07:45,776
要是我是蝙蝠侠 我一定暴扁他一顿
Yeah I would just kick his ass

131
00:07:45,811 --> 00:07:48,432
你啥时候扁过人了
Todd, when did you ever kick anyone's ass?

132
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:50,719
管它的 我肯定打到他下跪求饶
Whatever, man I would've just gone for his knees...

133
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,039
别吹牛了
You are not making sense.

134
00:07:52,074 --> 00:07:53,763
我想说的是小丑那部分
What I'm saying is that in the Joker portion

135
00:07:53,798 --> 00:07:55,501
蝙蝠侠打算复仇时
when he got in "Evaran" when

136
00:07:55,536 --> 00:07:56,700
他发誓要摧毁小丑的大本营
he vowed to penetrate the Joker's force field

137
00:07:56,735 --> 00:07:59,425
以削弱他的实力 好吧 我知道
leaving him totally vulnerable... All right. I know.

138
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,031
小毛孩
Pussy Patrol!

139
00:08:01,438 --> 00:08:03,023
手机 钱 都交出来
Phones. Money.

140
00:08:03,058 --> 00:08:04,608
别这样
Hey guys, not again Come on

141
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,096
手机呢
phone.

142
00:08:07,131 --> 00:08:09,550
没了 上周才被抢
I don't have one! Somebody else jacked it last week!

143
00:08:09,585 --> 00:08:10,818
可怜虫
Pussy

144
00:08:10,853 --> 00:08:13,460
袋子给我 只是漫画而已
Gimme the bag. It's just comics.

145
00:08:13,495 --> 00:08:15,149
你想被砍吗
Yo! You wanna get cut?

146
00:08:25,535 --> 00:08:27,975
那个孬种 只会置身事外
Look at this asshole, just watching

147
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:35,885
坦白讲
Come on, be honest with yourself

148
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,131
你不想做些改变吗
would you do anything differently

149
00:08:40,154 --> 00:08:43,501
我们看到别人深陷困难 希望自己可以帮忙
We see someone in trouble and we wish we can help

150
00:08:43,536 --> 00:08:44,867
但是我们没有
But we don't

151
00:08:49,277 --> 00:08:53,688
在这个世界里 英雄只存在漫画里
The world I lived in, heroes only exist in comic books

152
00:08:54,658 --> 00:08:59,131
要是坏蛋也只在漫画里出现就好了
But I guess that would have been OK if bad guys were make believe too.

153
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,841
但是 不可能
But they are not

154
00:09:00,876 --> 00:09:02,071
(弗兰克木材店)

155
00:09:02,468 --> 00:09:06,030
弗兰克 我发誓不是我做的
Frankie. I swear I'm not making this up.

156
00:09:06,065 --> 00:09:10,695
一个神秘人 陷害了我们
This fucking guy...Comes outta nowhere kicks our asses,

157
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,714
并偷走了可卡因
steals all the coke

158
00:09:12,749 --> 00:09:14,594
是个长得像蝙蝠侠的人
This would be the guy that looks like Batman.

159
00:09:14,629 --> 00:09:16,394
我没这么说
I didn't say look like Batman.

160
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:19,193
你说了 崔 你说那个人像蝙蝠侠
You did Tre. You said the the guy looked like Batman

161
00:09:19,228 --> 00:09:21,466
你说他戴了面具 披着斗篷?
And you said like a mask and stuff And a cape?

162
00:09:21,501 --> 00:09:22,296
对 就像蝙蝠侠
Yeah like Batman.

163
00:09:22,331 --> 00:09:25,407
我没说过像蝙蝠侠 我屁也没说过
I didn't say like Batman, I never said Batman?

164
00:09:25,442 --> 00:09:26,617
好吧
OK

165
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,922
让我跟你说说现在的问题 崔
Let me tell you the problem I got with that, Tre.

166
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:34,687
跟我们合作的俄罗斯人可不是这么说的
Our mole with the Russians tells things a little different.

167
00:09:35,303 --> 00:09:39,671
他说你把我的可卡因卖了 中饱私囊
according to him, you've sold him my coke and you took the money

168
00:09:39,706 --> 00:09:41,889
他骗人!
That's a fucking lie!

169
00:09:41,924 --> 00:09:44,228
你怎么会相信
I can't believe that you would believe this shit

170
00:09:44,263 --> 00:09:46,080
一个俄罗斯人的屁话
from a fucking Russian, man.

171
00:09:46,115 --> 00:09:48,347
或者这么说吧 哪个借口更好
Let's see, Tre. What's more likely?

172
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,638
你贪心私吞了我的货
That you're a greedy little cocksucker,

173
00:09:51,673 --> 00:09:55,197
还是我的货被超人偷了 是蝙蝠侠
Or that all my coke was stolen by Superman? Batman.

174
00:09:55,232 --> 00:09:56,459
我没说是蝙蝠侠
I never said Batman!

175
00:09:56,494 --> 00:09:57,794
够了
Enough

176
00:10:00,932 --> 00:10:04,144
我儿子在外面等着和我去看电影呢
My son is waitin' out there in the car to go to the movies.

177
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:06,021
我可不想让他失望
And I aint gonna to disappoint him

178
00:10:07,126 --> 00:10:08,732
乔 你处理吧
Joe, you're in charge

179
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:13,445
好的 这个借口是我迄今为止听过最烂的
Thanks - That's gotta be the worst fuckin' excuse I ever heard, Tre.

180
00:10:20,556 --> 00:10:21,699
对不起让你等这么久
Sorry you had to wait, buddy.

181
00:10:21,734 --> 00:10:23,705
电影还有十分钟就开始了
The movie is starting in 10 minutes

182
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,384
没事 我们能赶上
It's O.K. We're cool.

183
00:10:25,811 --> 00:10:27,174
只是错过预告而已
We're only gonna miss the trailers.

184
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,988
但是我想吃爆米花
Yeah, but I wanted to, get some popcorn.

185
00:10:29,023 --> 00:10:30,994
到那之后 给克里斯买爆米花
When we get in there, get Chris some popcorn.

186
00:10:31,004 --> 00:10:32,120
好吗
Okay?

187
00:10:33,381 --> 00:10:35,421
- 饮料呢 - 百事?
- What do you wanna drink, wanna Pepsi? - That's fine

188
00:10:35,456 --> 00:10:37,761
给他百事 我要加冰的
get him pepsi And I'll have an Icee.

189
00:10:38,272 --> 00:10:39,471
混合果味的
Mixed

190
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:42,161
红蓝混在一起的那种
Like, when they mix the red one and the blue one?

191
00:10:44,132 --> 00:10:45,863
还要包软糖
And a pack of Twizzlers.

192
00:11:07,405 --> 00:11:09,188
漫画书画错了
The comic - books had it wrong.

193
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:12,488
并不是伤口 宇宙射线
It didn't take a trauma, or cosmic rays

194
00:11:12,523 --> 00:11:14,944
或是魔法戒指造就超级英雄
or a power ring to make a superhero.

195
00:11:16,195 --> 00:11:20,418
只是乐观和天真的结合而已
...Just the perfect combination of optimism and naivety.

196
00:11:24,088 --> 00:11:27,529
(附寄资料)

197
00:11:54,254 --> 00:11:56,986
你tmd酷毙了
You are fucking awesome.

198
00:11:59,447 --> 00:12:00,302
来啊
C'mon

199
00:12:17,986 --> 00:12:21,646
同时
Meanwhile

200
00:12:28,695 --> 00:12:29,963
爸爸 我害怕
Daddy? I'm scared.

201
00:12:29,998 --> 00:12:33,199
没事的 明迪 勇敢点
C'mon Mindy, honey. Be a big girl now.

202
00:12:33,234 --> 00:12:34,999
没什么好怕的
There's nothin' to be afraid of.

203
00:12:35,034 --> 00:12:39,977
会很痛吗 只是几秒而已
Is it gonna hurt bad? oh, child. Only for a second, sugar.

204
00:12:40,012 --> 00:12:43,240
子弹的时速超过...?
Handgun bullet travels at...more than?

205
00:12:43,275 --> 00:12:44,498
700英里
700 miles an hour.

206
00:12:44,533 --> 00:12:45,687
时速700英里
700 miles an hour.

207
00:12:45,722 --> 00:12:47,668
像这么近的距离开枪
So at close range like this,

208
00:12:47,703 --> 00:12:50,223
肯定会把你打倒在地
the force is gonna take you off your feet, for sure.

209
00:12:50,258 --> 00:12:53,490
但是跟击胸差不多疼
But it's really no more painful than a punch in the chest.

210
00:12:53,525 --> 00:12:55,524
我讨厌被击胸
I hate getting punched in the chest.

211
00:12:56,264 --> 00:12:58,016
你会没事的 宝贝
You're gonna be fine, baby doll.

212
00:13:06,055 --> 00:13:07,468
怎么样
How was that?

213
00:13:07,503 --> 00:13:08,963
还行吧
Not so bad.

214
00:13:08,998 --> 00:13:10,389
有趣吗
Kinda fun, huh?

215
00:13:10,424 --> 00:13:12,182
你现在知道是什么滋味了
Now you know how it feels,

216
00:13:12,217 --> 00:13:15,502
所以有人拿枪指着你的时候不会害怕了
you won't be scared when some junkie asshole pulls a Glock.

217
00:13:15,537 --> 00:13:17,233
我本来就不怕
Wouldn't have been scared anyways.

218
00:13:17,566 --> 00:13:18,693
这才是我的女儿
That's my girl! 'kay.

219
00:13:18,728 --> 00:13:19,714
起来
Up you get.

220
00:13:20,371 --> 00:13:22,884
再打两发 然后回家
Two more rounds, and then home.

221
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:23,958
还要
Again?

222
00:13:25,512 --> 00:13:28,077
那回家的路上你要带我去玩保龄球
Only if we can go by the bowling alley on the way back.

223
00:13:28,525 --> 00:13:30,371
保龄球?
Bowling alley?

224
00:13:30,406 --> 00:13:31,181
对啊
Yep

225
00:13:31,216 --> 00:13:32,832
然后吃雪糕
And then icecream after

226
00:13:34,823 --> 00:13:36,081
好的
Okay.

227
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:37,531
再来两次
Two more rounds,

228
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:43,134
不畏缩 不抱怨 就这么定了
no wincing, no whining and you got yourself a deal, young lady.

229
00:13:43,895 --> 00:13:45,678
我要吃热焦糖圣代
I'm gonna get Hot fudge sundae.

230
00:13:45,713 --> 00:13:47,732
好主意 宝贝
Good call, baby doll!

231
00:13:51,006 --> 00:13:53,655
告诉我你想要什么
So you gonna tell a little more about what you might want

232
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:54,697
作为生日礼物
for your birthday?

233
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:56,981
我想养只狗
Can I get a puppy?

234
00:13:58,347 --> 00:13:59,646
你想要狗?
Do you want to get a dog?

235
00:13:59,681 --> 00:14:01,648
嗯 要可爱蓬松的那种
Yeah. A cuddly fluffy one.

236
00:14:01,683 --> 00:14:04,269
还有电影里化妆的莎莎娃娃
And a Bratz Moviestar Makeover Sasha.

237
00:14:09,619 --> 00:14:11,162
给你开玩笑的 爸爸
Just fucking with you daddy!

238
00:14:11,766 --> 00:14:14,811
我想要把手工制的42型蝴蝶刀
I'd love a Benchmade model - 42 butterfly knife.

239
00:14:14,846 --> 00:14:18,273
孩子 你总是没事吓我
Oh child. You always knock me for a loop.

240
00:14:18,815 --> 00:14:19,927
知道么 咋了
Know what? What?

241
00:14:19,962 --> 00:14:20,949
我打算给你买两把
I'm gonna get you two

242
00:14:20,984 --> 00:14:23,862
- 两把? - 左右开弓
- Two? - One dollars on. Two dollars on.

243
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:25,343
你应得的
That's what you get.

244
00:14:43,913 --> 00:14:46,808
时流的明镜 人伦的雅范
The glass of fashion and the mould of form,

245
00:14:46,843 --> 00:14:50,753
举世注目的中心 这样无可挽回地陨落了
Th' observ'd of all observers, quite, quite down!

246
00:14:50,788 --> 00:14:53,287
我是一切妇女中间最伤心而不幸的
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,

247
00:14:53,322 --> 00:14:57,010
(海扁王)

248
00:14:59,783 --> 00:15:01,062
必须承认
I'll be honest,

249
00:15:01,097 --> 00:15:04,528
我在前几个星期并没有打击犯罪
there wasn't a whole lotta crime fighting in those first few weeks.

250
00:15:05,351 --> 00:15:08,542
即使这样 我的新工作也十分繁重
But even so, my new vocation kept me plenty busy.

251
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,383
我在做战前准备
I called it preparation.

252
00:15:20,512 --> 00:15:22,619
如果你觉得是在做梦的话
But if you called it fantasizing,

253
00:15:22,654 --> 00:15:24,506
我也无所谓
it woulda been hard to argue.

254
00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:28,896
我从未感觉这么好
All I knew was I never felt so good about myself.

255
00:15:45,902 --> 00:15:46,955
操
Fuck!

256
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:51,491
好吧 我还在试验当中
Okay, maybe I was still in the beta testing phase.

257
00:15:51,846 --> 00:15:53,410
但这是个开始
But it was a start.

258
00:16:10,698 --> 00:16:12,689
看什么看
what the fuck are you looking at?

259
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,052
没什么
Nothing

260
00:16:14,087 --> 00:16:15,620
还不快滚
Get the fuck out of here

261
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,852
像每个连环杀手都知道的
Like every serial killer already knew,

262
00:16:22,887 --> 00:16:25,786
光靠想象是不够的
eventually fantasizing just doesn't do it for you anymore.

263
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:28,685
是时候付诸行动了
It was time to engage

264
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:37,162
这是嘛呀?
what the fuck?

265
00:16:45,837 --> 00:16:47,453
你他妈的看什么看
what the fuck are you looking at?

266
00:16:48,527 --> 00:16:50,832
我问你他妈的看什么
I said what the fuck are you looking at?

267
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,377
两个混球在偷别人
Two cheapshit losers screwing with a car

268
00:16:58,412 --> 00:17:01,384
辛辛苦苦赚钱买的车
that somebody probably worked their ass off to pay for.

269
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:03,678
什么
Say what?

270
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,524
让他说
Leave it be man.

271
00:17:06,399 --> 00:17:08,537
这个傻子喝高了
This Motherfucker is obviously high.

272
00:17:09,747 --> 00:17:11,071
我没有
I'm not high.

273
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,334
我不准你们任意妄为
I just think it sucks you guys think you can do what you want.

274
00:17:15,544 --> 00:17:18,265
乖乖地离开 我当什么都没发生过
Just walk away from the car, and we can just forget about it.

275
00:17:21,091 --> 00:17:22,760

00:26:15,136 --> 00:26:15,991

Yeah...?

419
00:26:18,045 --> 00:26:20,756

Well... I could buy you one... sometime if you want?

420
00:26:20,791 --> 00:26:23,675

If you, like, need someone to talk to?

421

- Man, did you just see that? - Yeah

424
00:26:35,625 --> 00:26:37,533
凯蒂・狄克斯莫刚说要买咖啡给我
Katie Deauxma just offered to buy me coffee

425
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:40,807
不过我觉得这事肯定没表面那么简单
Yeah..I really don't think that's the way it looks like

426
00:26:40,842 --> 00:26:42,288
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

427
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:45,833
重点是凯蒂・狄克斯莫就是个烂好人
The point is, Katie Deauxma is all about the lame ducks.

428
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,800
那又关我什么事
What's that got to do with me?

429
00:26:47,835 --> 00:26:50,202
我一直在想要怎么告诉你这事
I've been trying to figure out how to tell you this

430
00:26:51,412 --> 00:26:53,716
最近流言满天飞 没错
There's a rumor going around right

431
00:26:53,751 --> 00:26:55,197
说你是... 什么
that you... what?

432
00:26:55,232 --> 00:26:56,225
同志
...are gay.

433
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,184
同志
Gay!

434
00:26:57,219 --> 00:26:58,731
这到底是什么鬼八卦啊
What kind of rumor is that?

435
00:26:58,766 --> 00:27:00,243
你也知道 被打劫
Well you know, getting mugged...

436
00:27:00,278 --> 00:27:01,418
你们也被打劫过的
You guys have been mugged!

437
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,878
是没错 但你也知道
Yeah, I know...but...you know..

438
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:05,582
我们可没有被打得倒地不起还被人家扒光衣服
we didn't get beat up and have all our clothes taken off.

439
00:27:05,617 --> 00:27:08,251
事情不是这样的 是那些医护人员脱了我的衣服
That's not even true! The medics threw my clothes away!

440
00:27:09,638 --> 00:27:11,463
别担心了 那些谣言没什么的
Don't worry about it. Rumors don't mean shit.

441
00:27:11,498 --> 00:27:12,485
我们知道事情真相
We know the truth

442
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:13,367
是吗 没错
Right? Yes

443
00:27:13,402 --> 00:27:16,040
谁知道呢 搞不好你还能把她搞定
Yeah. And who knows, it might even get you laid.

444
00:27:16,075 --> 00:27:18,053
前提是她不认为他是个基佬 托德
Not if she thinks he's gay, Todd

445
00:27:18,088 --> 00:27:19,238
你个白痴
you fuckin' retard!

446
00:27:19,273 --> 00:27:21,254
我谨谢不敏 马蒂 你简直就是在帮倒忙
Thanks a lot, Marty. You aint fucking helping me -

447
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:22,443
我只不过是实话实说罢了
I'm just being honest

448
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,271
我试着做回过去的自己
I was getting back to my old self

449
00:27:29,043 --> 00:27:30,701
当然 我本应该要放弃的
I should have quit, of course.

450
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,245
但又不能就这样重新出发
But you can't just re - program yourself

451
00:27:33,923 --> 00:27:37,114
想要什么 你是谁 你的人生目标
what you want, who you are... your purpose in life.

452
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:39,303
哦 不 我只是在这站着而已
oh no...I'm just stand around here

453
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,161
就是这样
It is what it is.

454
00:27:48,448 --> 00:27:49,455
看到我的厉害没
You didn't see that did ya?

455
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:51,472
你最好赶紧给我滚蛋
I think it's best that you just walk away

456
00:27:51,507 --> 00:27:53,067
也许你不该这么做
Well maybe you shouldn't do that.

457
00:27:53,102 --> 00:27:54,023
什么
What? Huh?

458
00:27:54,058 --> 00:27:55,158
你还敢瞪我
You looking at me?

459
00:27:55,193 --> 00:27:56,258
我就长这样
Well this is my faces

460
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,020
我?
Me?

461
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,241
我的装备都已修好
My hardware was fixed now.

462
00:28:11,721 --> 00:28:15,152
我又回来了 现在是"海扁王"2.0版
I was back and running Kick - ass version 2.0

463
00:28:16,455 --> 00:28:19,166
"你们谁见过乱咬人先生"

485
00:30:34,847 --> 00:30:36,157
在打群架

486
00:30:40,995 --> 00:30:42,393
帅爆了!
It's Fucking awesome!

487
00:31:10,264 --> 00:31:11,296
放开他
Leave him alone

488
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:19,127
伙计 放弃吧
Give it up man

489
00:31:19,162 --> 00:31:20,337
现在走还来得及
Just walk away

490
00:31:21,536 --> 00:31:22,839
不 我永不放弃
No, never

491
00:31:24,195 --> 00:31:25,651
伙计 你脑子进水啦
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?

492
00:31:25,686 --> 00:31:28,084
为了这种垃圾 你宁愿死吗
You'd rather die for some piece of shit?

493
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,201
这点道理你都不懂?
That you don't even fucking know?

494
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,922
你们仨垃圾以多欺少
You're just three asholes laying into one guy

495
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:34,528
大家都有目共睹
while everyone else watches

496
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,364
你不是想知道我为什么要这么做吗
And you wanna know what's wrong with me?

497
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,181
没错 我宁愿死

498
00:31:43,089 --> 00:31:44,434
我跟你拼了
You bring it on!

我是"海扁王"
I'm Kick Ass

505
00:32:16,205 --> 00:32:18,207
兄弟 你看过这个没
Dude you gotta check this shit out.

506
00:32:18,242 --> 00:32:19,469
这是什么
what is it?

507
00:32:20,668 --> 00:32:22,065
接下来一小时你将看到
And coming up after the hour:

508
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,250
一个奇装打扮的义务警察

我爱死这一切了
And I was loving it

526
00:33:01,959 --> 00:33:05,369
最后 大家都想知道这个神秘人的庐山真面目
Finally, we want to know who is this man

527
00:33:05,404 --> 00:33:07,179
有没有人知道
Does anyone have any idea

528
00:33:07,214 --> 00:33:09,310
这个穿着紧身衣的十字军战士到底是谁
who this wet suit Crusader is?

529
00:33:09,345 --> 00:33:11,006
他是某个人的儿子
He must be someone's son...

530
00:33:11,041 --> 00:33:13,262
或是兄弟 或是邻居
Someone's brother... Someone's next door neighbor...

531
00:33:13,297 --> 00:33:15,775
搞嘛啊, 这到底是怎么回事
Holy shit. What happened?

532
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:16,887
怎么了
what happened?

533
00:33:16,922 --> 00:33:18,225
都是这家伙的功劳
This guy happened

534
00:33:19,717 --> 00:33:21,708
大家伙 快看
This right there from her everybody

535
00:33:23,095 --> 00:33:25,796
现在大家最喜欢的超级英雄是"海扁王" 对吧
Everbody's favorite superhero right now is Kick - Ass, right?

536
00:33:25,831 --> 00:33:27,120
"海扁王"
Kick - Ass!

537
00:33:30,227 --> 00:33:31,937
我喜欢"海扁王"
I like Kick - Ass

538
00:33:36,337 --> 00:33:38,444
你知道吗 大家都喜欢"海扁王"

539
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:41,812
那些观众对他可真是印象深刻
He sure does give plenty of action for the guests

540
00:33:41,847 --> 00:33:44,362
他就只有被人海扁的本事
Good at gettting his Ass - Kicked.

541
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:47,275
他应该叫他自己"被扁王"
He should call himself Ass - Kick, instead

542
00:33:48,078 --> 00:33:49,559
这又没什么意思
That doesn't even make any sense

543
00:33:52,478 --> 00:33:54,261
在我看来 这家伙到后来肯定小命不保
That guy's gonna end up dead that's what I think

544
00:33:54,296 --> 00:33:56,552
你说真的 这家伙挺有一套的
Are you serious? The guy owns.

545
00:33:56,587 --> 00:33:59,423
要是我有什么问题要解决的话 还真想去通知他
I'd probably notify him about it if a problem needed fixing

546
00:33:59,458 --> 00:34:01,696
你开玩笑吧 我手下有上百个能人
What you kidding me? I have 100 guys can fix a problem.

547
00:34:01,731 --> 00:34:03,656
而你要去找个穿连裤袜的人帮忙?
You gotta some guy in some panty - hose?

548
00:34:04,146 --> 00:34:05,888
我可不想成为你事业的绊脚石
Well, I wouldn't wanna get in the way of your business...

549
00:34:05,923 --> 00:34:07,181
而且那也没有我的容身之处
where I'm not wanted

550
00:34:07,535 --> 00:34:10,017
拜托 我知道你们都把我当成了"海扁王"
Please, I know you are mistaking me for Kick - Ass,

551
00:34:10,052 --> 00:34:12,321
可我不是
but I am not Kick - Ass

552
00:34:16,325 --> 00:34:18,386
我马上就回来
I'm backed up right now

你其实都不看漫画的吧
You don't actually read comics?

556
00:34:32,706 --> 00:34:35,271
对 我不久前才开始看 现在看得也颇有心得了
Yeah, I just started. It got right to my system.

557
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:37,096
里面全是图画还都标好顺序
It's got full graphs and shows you leads,

558
00:34:37,131 --> 00:34:38,375
差不多就是类似的东西吧
that kind of thing

559
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,704
其实我不是很喜欢波克式的超级英雄
I'm not really into Polk superheroes or not

560
00:34:42,299 --> 00:34:43,926
那我猜你也不会去排队
So...guess you're not gonna be lining up

561
00:34:43,961 --> 00:34:45,792
买 "海扁王"的新漫画
for that new Kick - Ass comic, then.

562
00:34:45,827 --> 00:34:46,939
我也是这么想的
I guess not

563
00:34:47,825 --> 00:34:50,074
我其实蛮想给他的网站寄封电邮
You know what, I was seriously thinking of e - mailing his site?

564
00:34:50,109 --> 00:34:53,039
现在还挺需要像他那样的人来帮我
I mean I could really use some help from a guy like that right now.

565
00:34:53,074 --> 00:34:55,698
帮忙? 真的? 要帮什么?
Help? Really? What with?

566
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:58,680
你知道我去针头交换处做志愿者的事吗
You know I volunteer at the needle exchange?

567
00:34:59,535 --> 00:35:00,512
不知道
No, I did't

568
00:35:00,547 --> 00:35:02,347
那有个叫拉瑟尔的人
there was this one guy, Rasul?

569
00:35:02,382 --> 00:35:04,724
对他我真的感到万分抱歉
And I just felt so sorry for him and...

570
00:35:04,759 --> 00:35:07,428
他的事我知道的越多 我就越...
more I found out about his up bringing and stuff I just...

571
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,325
现在感觉怪怪的
Wow, that's weird

572
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,602
通常都是我扮演心理专家的角色
I'm usually the one playing therapist

573
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,502
我能做个告解吗
Can I make a confession?

574
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,814
从小时候开始
Ever since I was little

575
00:35:21,849 --> 00:35:23,820
我就一直想要一个朋友
I always wanted a friend...

576
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,281
像你这样的朋友
...like...you.

577
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,199
我这么说没事吧
Is it okay to say that?

578
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:30,285
我不是歧视害怕同性恋
I mean it's not homophobic, is it?

579
00:35:31,807 --> 00:35:34,070
我也不觉得你会跟以前有所不同
I mean I don't think you're all the same or anything

580
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,894
当然不会 没事
Of course not. No.

581
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:47,750
谢谢你
Thank you

582
00:35:52,244 --> 00:35:53,356
我不知道自己是不是
I don't know if I was everything

583
00:35:53,391 --> 00:35:56,040
凯蒂心目中的"好姐妹"
Katie had always dreamed her gay b.f.f. would be.

584
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,989
不过我会尽力的
But I tried my best.

585
00:35:58,365 --> 00:36:01,785
但最重要的是 我叫她给"海扁王"寄了封电邮
But, more importantly, I talked her into e - mailing Kick - Ass.

586
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:04,684
长话短说
Long story short,

587
00:36:04,976 --> 00:36:07,165
她的前任"好姐妹"
this particular lame duck of hers

588
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,355
突然性情大变
turned out to be more of a lame cobra.

589
00:36:10,398 --> 00:36:11,510
她并不想要回给他的钱
She didn't want the money back

590
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:15,653
或是要他为他的无礼而道歉
that she'd given him, or an apology for the black eye he'd given her.

591
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:17,968
只要他明白他们什么关系也没有
She just wanted him to get that they were through,

592
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:19,761
别再去烦她就行
and leave her alone.

593
00:36:20,189 --> 00:36:21,520
那我们就来帮她实现梦想吧
let's be real

594
00:36:21,555 --> 00:36:24,370
再也没有别的要求能令我如此快乐了
no other request could've given me more pleasure.

595
00:36:41,637 --> 00:36:44,536
你以为你自己是谁 绿色安全套吗
Who the fuck you're supposed to be? The Greeen Condom?

596
00:36:45,891 --> 00:36:48,425
小鬼 离万圣节还有好几个月呢
You know it ain't Halloween for another few months, kid.

597
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:50,250
我来这是要见拉瑟尔
I'm here to see Rasul

598
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:53,441
你到底是谁
Who the fuck are you?

599
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,975
我是凯蒂的一个朋友
I am a friend of Katie's

600
00:37:03,065 --> 00:37:05,192
现在的小孩真是太不讲究仪表了
Boys Do not pay attention to their appearance these days...

601
00:37:19,425 --> 00:37:22,230
那么 你们哪个是拉瑟尔
So Uhh...which one of you guys is Rasul?

602
00:37:29,226 --> 00:37:33,241
我就是拉瑟尔 你就不能跟我的大咪咪说吗
I am Rasul. Can't you tell by my big titty's?

603
00:37:36,619 --> 00:37:38,100
这什么情况 不给糖就捣蛋还是别的什么
What is this? Trick or treat or somethin'?

604
00:37:40,488 --> 00:37:41,464
该死
fuck

605
00:37:41,499 --> 00:37:42,625
我完了
And now I am dead

606
00:37:43,804 --> 00:37:45,368
我有个口信要给拉瑟尔
I have a message for Rasul

607
00:37:45,403 --> 00:37:47,297
是关于凯蒂・狄克斯莫的
About Katie Deauxma

608
00:37:50,539 --> 00:37:51,526
凯蒂?
Katie?

609
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:52,854
哦 你就是拉瑟尔吧
Oh you're Rasul?

610
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:54,648
那好
Ok

611
00:37:54,658 --> 00:37:56,399
从现在开始你离凯蒂远点
You've gotta stay away from Katie now.

612
00:37:56,434 --> 00:37:58,641
一切都结束了 所以要是你...
It's over. So if you just...

613
00:37:58,676 --> 00:37:59,951
不再去纠缠她
leave her alone.

614
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,446
那么大家就会相安无事
everything will be fine

615
00:38:01,957 --> 00:38:03,021
什么?
What?

616
00:38:04,366 --> 00:38:05,457
你个小鬼
Yo Kid...

617
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:06,701
你到底是谁
Who the hell are you?

618
00:38:07,337 --> 00:38:08,537
这是怎么一回事
What is this?

619
00:38:09,235 --> 00:38:11,644
我是"海扁王" 要找就来找我
I'm Kick - Ass. Look me up.

620
00:38:12,134 --> 00:38:14,386
以下是我给你的忠告
And this is me giving you a message:

621
00:38:14,421 --> 00:38:16,638
别再去纠缠凯蒂了
leave Katie alone

622
00:38:29,088 --> 00:38:30,256
不然会怎样
Or what?

623
00:38:34,917 --> 00:38:36,002
否则的话
Or

624
00:38:36,471 --> 00:38:40,558
我会回来打断你的狗腿
I'll come back and break your fucking legs.

625
00:38:45,626 --> 00:38:46,700
我现在就站在这 小鬼
I'm right here now, baby

626
00:38:46,735 --> 00:38:47,461
要打就来啊
what's up...

627
00:38:57,898 --> 00:38:58,837
抓住他
hold him

628
00:39:05,373 --> 00:39:06,205
妈呀
Fuck

629
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,794
你可以滚去见阎罗王了
You're so fuckin' dead

630
00:39:23,215 --> 00:39:24,852
好你个贱人
Ok, you cunt

631
00:39:25,311 --> 00:39:26,990
把你们的看家本领给姑奶奶都使出来
Let see what you can do now.

632
00:39:27,564 --> 00:39:31,891
一 二 三 四
Eany...Meany...Miney...Mo

633
00:39:52,933 --> 00:39:53,788
这啥情况
what's that?

634
00:40:21,857 --> 00:40:23,390
嘿 我也有一把诶
Hey, I have one of those

635
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:41,825
来吧
Come on

636
00:40:43,045 --> 00:40:44,307
你想跟我玩玩
So you wanna play

637
00:41:01,282 --> 00:41:02,679
里面在搞什么
what the fuck

638
00:41:05,828 --> 00:41:08,957
你这基佬手上拿的不过是把电击枪
Aww dude, that is one fuckin' gay fuckin' taser.

639
00:41:12,001 --> 00:41:13,836
别紧张 我们是一路人
Relax. We're on the same team.

640
00:41:15,547 --> 00:41:16,475
嘿 快起来
Hey get Up

641
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:26,328
"风行萝莉" 我们要把背朝向哪
Now, Hit Girl, we always keep our backs where?

642
00:41:27,517 --> 00:41:29,102
墙壁 老爸 我知道的
To the wall, Daddy I know

643
00:41:29,435 --> 00:41:31,646
我保证下次不会再犯了
Um...it won't happen again

644
00:41:32,491 --> 00:41:33,909
顺便说下 准头不错
Nice shot by the way

645
00:41:33,944 --> 00:41:35,024
多谢夸奖
Thank you

646
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:53,939
当心点
Be careful

647
00:41:55,461 --> 00:41:58,527
嘿 穿绿衣服的笨蛋 不能走前门
Hey, Green asshole. Can't use the front door

648
00:42:13,386 --> 00:42:16,649
等等 什么事?
Wait, wait, wait What?

649
00:42:18,047 --> 00:42:19,517
你是谁
Who are you?

650
00:42:19,552 --> 00:42:20,685
我?
Me?

651
00:42:21,738 --> 00:42:23,072
我是"风行萝莉"
I'm "Hit Girl"

652
00:42:24,897 --> 00:42:27,170
那是"超级老爹"
and that's " Big Daddy"

653
00:42:33,625 --> 00:42:34,584
快点啊
Come on

654
00:42:39,912 --> 00:42:41,090
快啊
Come on!

655
00:43:17,585 --> 00:43:19,493
"风行萝莉"和"超级老爹"
"Hit Girl" and "Big Daddy"

656
00:43:19,528 --> 00:43:20,943
他们才是有真本事的
They were real deal

657
00:43:23,706 --> 00:43:24,603
而我
Me

658
00:43:25,531 --> 00:43:28,221
只不过是个穿着紧身衣的呆头鹅
I was just a stupid dick in a wetsuit

659
00:43:43,862 --> 00:43:45,801
这是什么 你给我看的什么鬼东西
What is this, What am I lookin' at here?

660
00:43:46,343 --> 00:43:49,138
这是萨尔的手机 他们在他手上发现的
It was Sal's phone. They found it in his hand

661
00:43:49,722 --> 00:43:51,838
想必是他们在他死之前拿走的
They must have taken that right before he died

662
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:55,947
我知道这挺狗血的 但是照片里的那个家伙
I know this sounds fucked up, Franky...but that guy in the picture...

663
00:43:56,895 --> 00:43:59,825
我想就是电视里播的那个超级英雄
I think it's that superhero nut job from the TV.

664
00:44:00,399 --> 00:44:01,410
谁?
Who?

665
00:44:02,297 --> 00:44:03,548
"海扁王"?
Kick - Ass?

666
00:44:04,226 --> 00:44:05,414
单枪匹马?
One guy?

667
00:44:06,467 --> 00:44:07,687
慢着 你说光那家伙一人
Hold on. You telling me one guy

668
00:44:07,722 --> 00:44:09,387
就在今晚杀了我8个人?
killed 8 of my men tonight?

669
00:44:14,048 --> 00:44:18,302
在萨尔地盘上杀了8个 还有4个死在拉瑟尔那
Eight at Sal's place...4 at that kid, Rasul's

670
00:44:19,533 --> 00:44:21,660
那我们在街上岂不是一个人都没有了
We have no mercenaries on the streets at all

671
00:44:21,695 --> 00:44:22,515
没错
Right

672
00:44:25,455 --> 00:44:26,644
单枪匹马一个人
One Guy

673
00:44:27,176 --> 00:44:28,198
我认为是的
I think

674
00:44:28,531 --> 00:44:29,654
如果你的猜测没错
Nah if you're right,

675
00:44:29,689 --> 00:44:31,607
那我们遇到了纽约最强的一批对手
we're gonna look like the biggest bunch of pussies in New York

676
00:44:32,733 --> 00:44:34,047
你准备让我怎么做
What do you want me to do?

677
00:44:35,194 --> 00:44:40,022
我要痛扁"海扁王"一顿 现在就去办
I want Kick - Ass' fuckin' head on a stick. And I want it now.

678
00:44:49,677 --> 00:44:51,742
我啥都没说 我发誓
I didn't say anything, to anyone, I swear!

679
00:44:51,992 --> 00:44:53,910
反应不错 屁股挨揍的家伙
Good move. Ass, Kick

680
00:44:53,945 --> 00:44:55,829
我们就一直这么干吧
Let's keep it that way

681
00:44:57,331 --> 00:44:58,759
你知道这是什么吗
You know what this is?

682
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:01,377
是你电击枪射出的
All the cartridge crap that comes outta

683
00:45:01,412 --> 00:45:03,437
所有破弹夹
your gay little taser when you fire it.

684
00:45:03,472 --> 00:45:05,599
你知不知道警察只要发现这个
Do you know the police could've traced it right back to you

685
00:45:05,634 --> 00:45:07,066
就很容易会查到你这来?
if they'd found it?

686
00:45:07,101 --> 00:45:09,989
你运气好 我帮你都捡起来了
Lucky for you, I picked it up

687
00:45:11,522 --> 00:45:12,732
谢谢
Thank you

688
00:45:13,514 --> 00:45:14,865
我们只是以防万一
Let's call it insurance

689
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,410
这也方便得到你的承诺
Makes it easier for me to take your word

690
00:45:17,445 --> 00:45:20,677
我们很喜欢你 但却不相信你
See, we like you. But we don't trust you

691
00:45:22,022 --> 00:45:24,660
别钻牛角尖 我们谁也不相信
Don't take it personal though. We don't trust anybody

692
00:45:24,695 --> 00:45:27,748
我反追踪了你的IP地址
I re - routed your IP address.

693
00:45:27,783 --> 00:45:30,802
要找到你简直是易如反掌
Finding you was way too easy

694
00:45:32,001 --> 00:45:33,540
真该死
Aw Shit. Shit

695
00:45:33,575 --> 00:45:35,859
我没想到 我的老天 我...
I hadn't thought My God, I...

696
00:45:36,964 --> 00:45:38,233
我欠你个人情
I owe you

697
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:41,458
知道吗 我正在考虑把我的网页关闭掉
You know what? I'm thinking of shutting my site down anyway,

698
00:45:41,865 --> 00:45:45,744
我不玩了 这太疯狂了
quitting. This is... fucking insane

699
00:45:46,547 --> 00:45:48,274
我脑袋肯定是短路了
I'm in way over my head

700
00:45:48,309 --> 00:45:50,718
真遗憾 你很有潜力的
It's a shame. You have potential

701
00:45:50,753 --> 00:45:51,590
这是你的决定 孩子
Your call, son.

702
00:45:51,625 --> 00:45:54,221
只要你需要 我们随时恭候大驾
But, y'know, we're around if you need us

703
00:45:55,472 --> 00:45:57,074
那我要怎么联系你们
How do I get hold of you?

704
00:45:57,109 --> 00:45:58,868
联系市长办公室就行
Just contact the mayor's office.

705
00:45:58,903 --> 00:46:01,238
他有照在天上的特殊信号
He has a special signal he shines in the sky?

706
00:46:01,572 --> 00:46:03,303
形状像是只大公鸡
It's in the shape of a giant cock

707
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:05,545
当你需要我们的时候 就在你的网页上写
You need us, put on your web site

708
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:06,786
正在度假中
that you're on vacation

709
00:46:06,821 --> 00:46:07,647
我们就会来找你
We'll find you

710
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:09,111
风行萝莉 回总部
Hit Girl, back to headquarters

711
00:46:11,843 --> 00:46:13,230
做个好梦
Sweet dreams

712
00:46:19,163 --> 00:46:21,060
我要你去摆平"海扁王"
I need you to get rid of Kick - Ass

713
00:46:21,686 --> 00:46:22,583
出什么事了
What's up?

714
00:46:22,604 --> 00:46:23,813
出什么事?
What's up?

715
00:46:24,147 --> 00:46:26,952
"海扁王"杀了我的人 吉甘特 事实就是这样
Kick - Ass is killing my men, Gigante, that's what's up

716
00:46:27,921 --> 00:46:29,214
我深表遗憾
My condolences

717
00:46:29,777 --> 00:46:32,979
但是恐怕我这次帮不了你
But I'm afraid I can't help you out on this one

718
00:46:33,014 --> 00:46:35,314
他不在我的管辖范围之内
He's movin' outside my jurisdiction

719
00:46:35,349 --> 00:46:36,968
不在你的辖区?
Outside your jurisdiction?

720
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:38,974
你个死警察 他正在犯法
You're a fucking cop and he's breaking the law!

721
00:46:39,009 --> 00:46:40,243
这么明目张胆
That's so inside your jurisdiction

722
00:46:40,278 --> 00:46:42,446
你还说不在你管辖范围之内
it's ball - deep in your jurisdiction's ass!

723
00:46:43,687 --> 00:46:45,585
上头付工资让我将坏人绳之以法
The boss pays me to nail the bad guys.

724
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:46,721
但你不是我的衣食父母
You pay me not to

725
00:46:47,368 --> 00:46:48,657
凡事都有灰色地带
Everything else is in the grey area

726
00:46:48,692 --> 00:46:51,351
是这样没错 维克 就按我说的办
Yeah, Fuck you very much, Vic. Just do it, okay?

727
00:46:53,238 --> 00:46:54,844
真是令人难以置信
Un - fuckin'believable

728
00:46:56,325 --> 00:46:57,555
科迪人呢
where is Cody?

729
00:46:57,910 --> 00:46:58,928
他迟到了
He's late

730
00:46:58,963 --> 00:47:03,374
谢谢你 科迪 非常感谢你的配合
Thank you, Cody. We appreciate your cooperation

731
00:47:03,409 --> 00:47:04,719
那现在让我出去吧
Let me out now?

732
00:47:05,219 --> 00:47:07,013
我已经把名字和地址都告诉给你了
I gave you all them names and address

733
00:47:08,285 --> 00:47:09,438
我保证不跟别人说一个字
Hey, I won't say nothing to nobody.

734
00:47:09,473 --> 00:47:12,132
你跟你那小贱人也可以滚回老家去了
You and you're crazy bitch friend can go back to where ever you once

735
00:47:12,167 --> 00:47:14,927
嘿 拜托 你现在做的事太不上道了
Hey come on now...that's a very bad thing you're doing now..

736
00:47:14,962 --> 00:47:16,664
真是令人讨厌的家伙
Really nasty individuals...

737
00:47:16,699 --> 00:47:19,598
让我走 嘿 别这么做
Let me go, Hey... Do not do this

738
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:21,423
求你了
Come on!

739
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,060
拜托 停
please..hey..stop!

740
00:47:31,329 --> 00:47:32,559
住手 求你了
stop, please!

741
00:47:46,761 --> 00:47:48,408
洗得可真干净
What a douche

742
00:48:01,922 --> 00:48:04,007
你是自己晒黑的吧
You've done a self tan before, right?

743
00:48:05,029 --> 00:48:07,396
对 我常晒太阳
Yeah, I do it all the time

744
00:48:08,345 --> 00:48:11,500
谋杀 超级英雄闯进我的卧室
Murder. Superheroes breaking into my bedroom

745
00:48:11,535 --> 00:48:15,091
我这一生就是在这些梦里不能自拔
My life was turning into some fucked up dream I couldn't wake up from

746
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,231
就算是好的也是很离奇的
Even with the good parts, were totally surreal

747
00:48:19,804 --> 00:48:22,369
哦 我看了你给我的蜘蛛侠
Oh hey, I read those old Ditko Spider - Mans you gave me?

748
00:48:22,404 --> 00:48:23,766
真的挺好看的
They're actually pretty good

749
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:26,425
确实是的
Yeah, they are

750
00:48:27,989 --> 00:48:30,346
拉瑟尔也有一个礼拜没来烦我了
And it's been a whole week since I've heard from Rasul

751
00:48:34,048 --> 00:48:35,632
那真是太好了
That's great

752
00:49:30,687 --> 00:49:33,607
很久以前有两个超级警察
Once upon a time, there were two super cops

753
00:49:33,642 --> 00:49:35,991
他们叫老爹和马卡斯
called Daddy and Marcus...

754
00:49:36,026 --> 00:49:38,445
他们的特长就是逮捕坏人
who were very good at getting bad guys

755
00:49:39,988 --> 00:49:42,861
弗兰克・阿米克则是坏人中的败类
Frank Damico was the baddest guy of them all

756
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:45,734
为了除掉老爹他想出了一条毒计
and he came up with a plan to get rid of Daddy

757
00:49:46,078 --> 00:49:48,372
"给我搜"
Search this place!

758
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:51,152
他诬告老爹是毒贩子
Being framed as drug dealer

759
00:49:51,187 --> 00:49:54,347
这也是发生在老爹身上最糟糕的事
was the worst possible thing that could have happened to Daddy

760
00:49:57,204 --> 00:50:00,426
监狱并不是他的栖身之所
Prison was not his natural habitat

761
00:50:00,905 --> 00:50:02,647
他非常的沮丧
He was very upset

762
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,368
英雄警察锒铛入狱
HERO COP JAILED

763
00:50:06,223 --> 00:50:10,091
而在老爹入狱期间 他怀孕的妻子则孤身一人
With Daddy in prison His pregnant wife was all alone

764
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:13,470
无法承受心理压力
And could not cope

765
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:18,371
但总有拨开云雾见青天的时候
But all clouds have a silver lining

766
00:50:18,406 --> 00:50:20,122
在她死之后
And out of her death..

767
00:50:23,949 --> 00:50:25,503
明迪出生了
Mindy was born

768
00:50:26,212 --> 00:50:28,527
马卡斯成为了孩子的监护人
Marcus became the child's guardian

769
00:50:29,048 --> 00:50:31,947
老爹也开始重新规划他的人生
And Daddy started a plan of his very own

770
00:50:34,053 --> 00:50:36,191
五年后 他出狱了
Five years later he left prison

771
00:50:36,587 --> 00:50:38,234
而且他也做好了准备
And he was ready

772
00:50:42,061 --> 00:50:44,876
现在明迪也该做好准备了
Now it's time for Mindy to get ready too

773
00:50:53,343 --> 00:50:54,688
你是怎么找到我的 马卡斯
How'd you find me Marcus?

774
00:50:55,981 --> 00:50:58,348
我们俩中还有一个是警察呢 记得吗
One of us is still a cop, remember?

775
00:51:07,441 --> 00:51:09,022
你给明迪洗脑了?
Now you brain - washed Mindy?

776
00:51:09,057 --> 00:51:11,903
你所说的洗脑在我看来只不过是场游戏
You say brain - washed I say made it into a game

777
00:51:11,938 --> 00:51:13,808
你说这是什么? 游戏? 达蒙
What you call this? Playing, Damon?

778
00:51:13,843 --> 00:51:17,200
义务警察私自执法 四处屠杀 收手吧 搭档
Vigilante justice. Mass murder. C'mon, partner

779
00:51:19,432 --> 00:51:20,818
她在哪
So where is she?

780
00:51:21,382 --> 00:51:23,092
她现在很安全 我能见见她吗
She's safe Can I see her?

781
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:26,178
我很想她
I miss her

782
00:51:27,992 --> 00:51:29,556
我很想你们俩
I miss you both

783
00:51:30,443 --> 00:51:32,174
多谢你的关心
I appreciate your concern

784
00:51:32,924 --> 00:51:34,530
但是你现在得走了
But you need to go now

785
00:51:40,234 --> 00:51:41,460
有一点我要先警告你
I should warn you that asshole,

786
00:51:41,495 --> 00:51:43,533
吉甘特正在找"海扁王"
Gigante, is looking for Kick - Ass.

787
00:51:43,568 --> 00:51:45,572
他跟你有关系吗 达蒙
He got something to do with you Damon?

788
00:51:45,833 --> 00:51:49,232
你准备建个什么超级英雄俱乐部吗
You started some kinda fucked - up superhero club?

789
00:51:49,267 --> 00:51:50,741
我没听说过这人
Never heard of him

790
00:51:50,776 --> 00:51:52,684
当心点 好吗
Ok, well heads up, alright?

791
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:54,630
你再这样执迷不悟下去
You keep carrying on like you've been carrying on

792
00:51:54,665 --> 00:51:57,543
吉甘特找上门来那是迟早的事
and it's only a matter of time before Gigante's looking for you

793
00:51:58,231 --> 00:51:59,124
在你放弃机会之后
He's been on D'Amico's payroll

794
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:01,641
他一直在阿米克的贿赂名单上
ever since you passed up the opportunity,

795
00:52:02,756 --> 00:52:04,435
你知道我不会就这么收手的
You know I'm not gonna stop

796
00:52:06,051 --> 00:52:12,474
除非阿米克和他的整个组织都瓦解
Not 'til D'Amico and his whole damn operation are burnt to ashes

797
00:52:12,509 --> 00:52:13,986
湮没了
And buried

798
00:52:15,331 --> 00:52:17,187
即使这样她也不可能活过来了 达蒙
It ain't gonna bring her back, Damon

799
00:52:18,522 --> 00:52:20,722
这不是明迪该有的生活
This is not the life for Mindy

800
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:25,247
你欠那个孩子一个童年
You owe that kid a childhood

801
00:52:26,968 --> 00:52:28,803
我告诉你是谁毁了她的童年
I'll tell you who owes her a childhood:

802
00:52:29,512 --> 00:52:31,493
是弗兰克・阿米克
Frank D'Amico

803
00:52:50,345 --> 00:52:52,389
该死
Holy shit

804
00:52:54,475 --> 00:52:57,019
真不敢相信
I don't fuckin' believe it

805
00:53:00,178 --> 00:53:02,045
跟上 在拐角那
Follow him. Around the corner

806
00:53:02,848 --> 00:53:04,099
别开得太快
Not too fast

807
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:09,177
他还跟别人击掌
He's doing the high fives

808
00:53:09,802 --> 00:53:11,867
我让你击鬼个掌
I'll give 'em a motherfuckin' high five

809
00:53:13,024 --> 00:53:14,426
击掌 狗屎
High five and bullshit

810
00:53:14,461 --> 00:53:15,829
跟上 跟上
Keep going, keep going

811
00:53:17,143 --> 00:53:18,467
别跟得太紧
Not too close

812
00:53:23,827 --> 00:53:25,193
他要进小巷子里去了
He's going into the alley

813
00:53:25,693 --> 00:53:27,633
他要进小巷子里去了
He's going to the alley

814
00:53:28,133 --> 00:53:30,771
好 等会我让你停你就停
Okay, when I tell you stop the car

815
00:53:30,969 --> 00:53:31,897
准备好了没
Ready?

816
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:37,716
嘿 "海扁王"
Hey Kick - Ass

817
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:39,228
你好吗
How you doing?

818
00:53:41,668 --> 00:53:43,294
敢杀我的人 啊?
Kill my men, huh?!

819
00:53:43,329 --> 00:53:44,921
抢我的可卡因?
Take my fucking coke?!

820
00:53:46,454 --> 00:53:47,877
你在干什么
What are you doing?

821
00:53:47,912 --> 00:53:49,300
快走 快
Let us go, come on

822
00:53:51,365 --> 00:53:53,033
快点 弗兰克 打也打够了 快
Come on, Frank, he had enough, Come on

823
00:53:54,389 --> 00:53:56,891
你看什么看 啊?
What the fuck are you looking at? Huh?

824
00:54:10,332 --> 00:54:12,219
快 快走
Come on, let's go Come on

825
00:54:22,667 --> 00:54:24,002
他还这么年轻
He was so young

826
00:54:24,283 --> 00:54:26,129
谁愿意就这么死了
Who would get to die that way?

827
00:54:26,869 --> 00:54:29,257
我真的不敢相信他就这么死了
I just can't believe he's dead that's all

828
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:32,218
我明白
Oh, I know

829
00:54:33,063 --> 00:54:34,220
听好了 凯蒂
Listen Katie

830
00:54:34,773 --> 00:54:38,746
像拉瑟尔那样的人 他们的生活本来就是一团乱
guys like Rasul... They get mixed up in stuff, and...

831
00:54:38,781 --> 00:54:41,988
我知道 但万一那是我的错呢
I know, but what if it was my fault?

832
00:54:42,228 --> 00:54:43,152
万一是"海扁王"干的呢
What if Kick - Ass did it?

833
00:54:43,187 --> 00:54:45,638
我觉得应该打电话报警什么的
I mean I feel like should call cops or something

834
00:54:46,097 --> 00:54:47,410
你疯了吧

835
00:54:47,692 --> 00:54:50,486
不可能的 他搞不好都没有看到你的邮件
there's no way! He probably didn't even read your e - mail yet

836
00:54:50,716 --> 00:54:52,687
- 是吗? - 没什么好担心的
- Yeah? - There's nothing to worry about

837
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,430
你在这我真高兴
I'm so glad you're here

838
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,536
我看起来糟透了
I look like such a mess

839
00:54:58,797 --> 00:55:00,293
你很好
You look Okay

840
00:55:00,328 --> 00:55:01,789
我就在这
I'm here

841
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,802
我没事了
Yeah I'm Okay

842
00:55:05,501 --> 00:55:07,139
希望我这么说不会冒犯到你
I hope it's Okay to say this, but

843
00:55:08,181 --> 00:55:10,162
但你是个基佬 这真是遗憾
It so sucks that you're gay

844
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:13,801
海扁王扮演者被害
KICK - ASS Impersonator Killed

845
00:55:13,854 --> 00:55:16,471
我真不敢相信这个
I don't fuckin' believe this

846
00:55:18,473 --> 00:55:22,883
这群小鬼有什么不好玩的 啊?
What kind of children's fuckin' entertainer is that? Huh?

847
00:55:23,749 --> 00:55:27,179
那些小鬼头开个蜘蛛侠派对不行啊
What kind of kid has a Spider - Man party sure.

848
00:55:27,214 --> 00:55:28,896
非得开什么破"海扁王"派对
But a fuckin' Kick - Ass Party?

849
00:55:28,931 --> 00:55:31,736
楼下的现在卖什么纸盘和餐巾纸
What are they're selling paper plates and napkins down at the store, now?

850
00:55:31,771 --> 00:55:33,269
弗兰克 你吓到我了
Frank, You're scarin' me

851
00:55:33,304 --> 00:55:34,551
你失控了
You're losin' it.

852
00:55:34,729 --> 00:55:36,845
你什么时候开始又想再惹一身腥?
Since when did you start getting your hands dirty again, huh?

853
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:37,740
还在光天化日之下
And in public

854
00:55:37,775 --> 00:55:39,880
就在我叫你摆平"海扁王"的时候
Since when I asked you Fucks to deliver me Kick - Ass

855
00:55:39,915 --> 00:55:41,377
你还不听我的
and you don't deliver that's when

856
00:55:41,412 --> 00:55:43,275
让我喘口气行不行 都已经一个礼拜了
Hey give me a break it's been a week

857
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:46,876
我们给他写电邮 找了一堆手下惹事当诱饵
We e - mailed him. We got half the crew doing petty crimes as bait

858
00:55:46,911 --> 00:55:48,659
我们都在卖力干活呢
We're bustin' our asses here.

859
00:55:49,754 --> 00:55:51,026
你到底在干什么
What hell are you doing?

860
00:55:51,871 --> 00:55:53,671
你也嗨高了?
You back on the Powder now, as well?

861
00:55:53,706 --> 00:55:58,148
妈咪 我想办海扁王派对 傻逼蠢货
Mommy, I want Kick - Ass party. Dumb little fuck.

862
00:55:59,024 --> 00:56:00,431
我知道一个办法可以帮你抓住他
I know a way you could get him

863
00:56:00,466 --> 00:56:02,179
该死 克里斯
Aww shit. Chris

864
00:56:02,214 --> 00:56:03,326
你在那多久了
How long you been there?

865
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:04,769
你在那干什么 还不快点出去
What the hell you doin'? Get the hell out!

866
00:56:04,804 --> 00:56:06,500
你到底想不想听
You wanna hear it or not?

867
00:56:06,917 --> 00:56:07,914
听什么
Hear what?

868
00:56:07,949 --> 00:56:10,313
听着 你是一个超级英雄
Okay, look, you're a superhero

869
00:56:10,348 --> 00:56:12,210
但你也是孤独的 不能相信任何人
and you're lonely but you can't trust

870
00:56:12,245 --> 00:56:14,320
因为他们都有可能会暴露你的真实身份
anyone because either they'll expose your secret identity...

871
00:56:14,355 --> 00:56:16,479
漫画书 那些小鬼头一天到晚看的东西
Comic books, this kids reads, all fucking day long

872
00:56:16,792 --> 00:56:18,195
重点是 有这么一个办法
Point is, there's only one way

873
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:20,232
可以让超级英雄轻易的相信陌生人
a superhero would trust a stranger and...

874
00:56:20,608 --> 00:56:23,830
我可以是那个陌生人 你给我制造一个机会就好
I could be that stranger. You just gotta give me a chance

875
00:56:24,059 --> 00:56:26,155
我知道我能做到的 只需要一点点东西而已
I know I can do it. I just need a few things

876
00:56:28,324 --> 00:56:29,460
比如说
Like what?

877
00:56:31,212 --> 00:56:33,099
我要这些东西
I need these things

878
00:56:37,249 --> 00:56:38,303
什么 你开什么国际玩笑
What, you fucking kidding me?

879
00:56:38,338 --> 00:56:39,118
这到底是什么
What the hell is this?

880
00:56:39,153 --> 00:56:41,020
这就是我所需要的一切
It's everything I need

881
00:56:41,055 --> 00:56:43,412
你只要随便欺负个人 像是路易或者别的谁
And you might have to screw somebody over Like Louie or somebody

882
00:56:43,447 --> 00:56:44,972
路易? 嘿 克里斯
Louie?! Oh whoa, hey, Chris

883
00:56:45,007 --> 00:56:46,686
其他人也行 不是非得路易
Or somebody it doesn't have to be Louie

884
00:56:47,364 --> 00:56:48,897
托尼

885
00:56:49,533 --> 00:56:50,269
托尼?

886
00:56:50,304 --> 00:56:52,942
- 我恨托尼 - 那个死托尼就是个废柴
- I hate Tony - Hey fuck Tony he's a scum bag

887
00:56:53,213 --> 00:56:56,102
老爸 我发誓 这么做肯定能成
I swear dad If you let me do this it's gonna work

888
00:57:01,211 --> 00:57:02,076
托尼
Tony

889
00:57:02,598 --> 00:57:05,872
托尼・罗米塔 美国最大犯罪集团的主脑之一
Tony Romita, one of America's most wanted crime king - pins

890
00:57:05,907 --> 00:57:07,061
今天在皇后区被捕
was arrested in Queens today

891
00:57:07,436 --> 00:57:10,345
有人报警自称是超级英雄...
After a 911 cal from someone claiming to be a superhero...

892
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:12,785
跟凯蒂怎么样了
So how are things going with Katie?

893
00:57:14,088 --> 00:57:16,671
还不错 在她家过夜
Oh, just peachy. Had a sleep over

894
00:57:16,706 --> 00:57:19,729
整晚都在看"丑女贝蒂"
and spent the whole night watching the entire Ugly Betty box set

895
00:57:19,928 --> 00:57:21,054
还修趾甲
and did pedicures.

896
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:24,745
告诉你 等得越久就越难办
I'm telling you, though the longer you wait, the worse it's gonna get.

897
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:25,788
我知道
I know.

898
00:57:26,205 --> 00:57:28,301
我本来要告诉她 她看起来那么的开心
I was gonna tell her. She just seems so...happy.

899
00:57:28,603 --> 00:57:30,000
我不知道什么时候才合适
I don't know whens the right time.

900
00:57:30,035 --> 00:57:31,470
现在你的机会来了
Well, now's your chance.

901
00:57:32,461 --> 00:57:34,035
她很开心 你们好
She seems happy Hey guys

902
00:57:35,516 --> 00:57:36,413
嗨
Hi

903
00:57:37,789 --> 00:57:40,886
你看电视了吗 新的超级英雄 多酷啊
Oh, did you watch the TV? The new superhero guy? How cool was that?

904
00:57:41,574 --> 00:57:42,815
什么 看啊
What? Oooh look.

905
00:57:43,034 --> 00:57:44,859
大点声吧
Can you turm it up please?

906
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:45,776
看这个
Check this out.

907
00:57:46,444 --> 00:57:48,202
毫不迟疑
But it seems that far from being put - off,

908
00:57:48,237 --> 00:57:51,299
这个自称为"红旋风"的人
this individual, who calls himself Red Mist,

909
00:57:51,334 --> 00:57:53,513
决定要将打击犯罪的行动提升到新的高度
has decided to take crime fighting to a new level,

910
00:57:53,548 --> 00:57:55,140
正如他昨晚的壮举所证明的
as his actions last night proved.

911
00:57:55,567 --> 00:57:56,867
红旋风 你怎么看
Red Mist, how do you see it?

912
00:57:56,902 --> 00:57:59,467
我猜人们已经受够担惊受怕的日子了
Well, I guess folks have just had enough of living in fear, you know,

913
00:57:59,502 --> 00:58:00,975
而且 海扁王已经证明
and uh...Kick - Ass really proved that

914
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:02,647
一人之力也可以做出改变
one individual can make a difference.

915
00:58:02,682 --> 00:58:04,249
所以 如果有人需要帮助
So, If anyone out there needs help,

916
00:58:04,284 --> 00:58:06,844
我会马上赶到打击犯罪
I'm gonna be fighting crime twentyfive/eight.

917
00:58:06,879 --> 00:58:09,404
只要鼠阂坏 RedMist.org
And I'm just one click away. RedMist.org.

918
00:58:10,937 --> 00:58:12,438
现在可以关上了吗
Can you turn that off now?

919
00:58:13,033 --> 00:58:14,583
他有什么特别的
What's so special about that guy?

920
00:58:14,618 --> 00:58:17,496
貌似他抓了个毒贩 头号通缉犯
He caught, like, a drug dealer Some most - wanted guy

921
00:58:17,767 --> 00:58:19,414
他看到他们拿出无数的毒品
He saw 'em bringing out, like, Na ton of stuff,

922
00:58:19,449 --> 00:58:20,718
真酷
That's Pretty cool.

923
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,856
是的 造型也比海扁王酷
Yeah. way better costume than Kickass, too.

924
00:58:23,891 --> 00:58:25,198
他穿斗蓬 是的

925
00:58:25,233 --> 00:58:26,470
斗蓬最棒了 是的

I'm kinda feelin' the cape. Looks good.

927
00:58:30,175 --> 00:58:32,239
什么 比海扁王还棒?
What, better than Kick - Ass?

928
00:58:32,865 --> 00:58:33,873
我是说 他们都很性感
I mean they're both kinda hot

929
00:58:33,908 --> 00:58:36,045
我只是觉得"红旋风"身材更好
I just think that Red Mist has a better body.

930
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,526
你怎么想 戴夫
Don't you think, Dave?

931
00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:40,150
是啊, 戴夫你怎么想
Yeah Dave what do you think?

932
00:58:40,185 --> 00:58:44,554
你不就喜欢这样的家伙吗 全身皮装?
Is that the kind of guy you'd go for? With all that leather?

933
00:58:45,701 --> 00:58:47,313
不 我不喜欢
No, not me.

934
00:58:47,348 --> 00:58:49,038
他不是我喜欢的类型
No, he's not really my type

935
00:59:20,006 --> 00:59:23,968
(红旋风: 约个时间地点 我们聚聚)

936
00:59:43,019 --> 00:59:44,072

944
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:01,965

955
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:28,502
我之前从没在工作日的半夜打击过犯罪
I never fight crime between, like nine and two on weekdays,

956
01:00:28,537 --> 01:00:30,504
所以务必得快点回来

962
01:00:56,404 --> 01:00:57,433
动起来

01:01:21,805 --> 01:01:23,014
抽吗
Smoke?

970
01:01:23,049 --> 01:01:24,189
不
Nuh - uh.

971
01:01:24,224 --> 01:01:26,987
巡逻时来点"货"能轻松点 你知道的
Yeah, well "Weed" takes the edge off things when I'm patrol..ya know.

972
01:01:27,022 --> 01:01:29,479
冲到人群中有点吓人 你不觉得吗
Runnin' up against a crowd can get kinda scary, don't you thimk?

973
01:01:32,597 --> 01:01:33,765
怎么了
Something wrong?

974
01:01:36,392 --> 01:01:38,374
你跟我想的不一样
You're so not how I expected

975
01:01:44,744 --> 01:01:46,555
我收到了一个小妞的邮件
Oh, I got e - mail from this chick,

976
01:01:46,590 --> 01:01:49,228
她说她下班回家有人跟踪她
she said this guy's been following her home from work.

977
01:01:49,885 --> 01:01:51,939
我有她的地址 你想探探吗
I've got her address and stuff. You wanna check it out?

978
01:01:53,243 --> 01:01:54,452
当然 为什么不
Sure, why not?

979
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:55,662
酷
Cool

980
01:02:02,908 --> 01:02:04,402
这小妞一丝不挂 是吧
So this chick was totally naked, right?

981
01:02:04,754 --> 01:02:05,783
我让她坐我腿上
So I tell her to sit in my lap

982
01:02:05,818 --> 01:02:07,736
把脑子里想到的第一件事说出来
and talk about the first thing that comes up.

983
01:02:18,122 --> 01:02:20,801
守住前门 他在路上了
Yep. Let's get the front he's on his way.

984
01:02:21,604 --> 01:02:22,741
很好
Very good.

985
01:02:23,283 --> 01:02:24,826
我到之前别杀他
Don't kill him 'til I get there.

986
01:02:24,983 --> 01:02:25,817
好的
Right

987
01:02:31,885 --> 01:02:34,419
看那么多漫画书还是有点用的 是吧
Looks like reading all them comics paid off, huh?

988
01:02:34,826 --> 01:02:36,765
你儿子很棒 弗兰克
Your boy did good, Frankie.

989
01:02:39,216 --> 01:02:40,717
虎父无犬子
He's his father's son.

990
01:02:52,583 --> 01:02:53,501
忘给你了
I forget

991
01:03:25,272 --> 01:03:26,982
怎么回事
What...the...fuck?

992
01:03:31,205 --> 01:03:32,144
妈的

993
01:03:33,927 --> 01:03:35,277
你要干什么
Hey! What are you doing?

994
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:36,627
里面有人
There are people in there!

995
01:03:37,618 --> 01:03:39,338
我们是不是应该报警...
Shouldn't we just call the Fire...

996
01:03:41,223 --> 01:03:42,068
妈的
Shit!

997
01:04:05,183 --> 01:04:07,697

01:04:19,201 --> 01:04:21,234
红旋风 你能听到吗
Red Mist...can you hear me?!

999
01:04:34,664 --> 01:04:35,759
红旋风
Red Mist!

1000
01:04:38,522 --> 01:04:40,212
你他妈的在哪啊
Where the fuck are you?

1001
01:05:14,965 --> 01:05:16,696
我们得逃出去
We've gotta get the hell out of here!

1002
01:05:16,967 --> 01:05:18,854
快给我跑
Just move your fucking ass!

1003
01:05:38,426 --> 01:05:39,490

Shit!

1004
01:05:40,032 --> 01:05:41,221
你看到那些尸体了吗
Did you see those bodies?

1005
01:05:41,256 --> 01:05:42,295
是的
Yeah, man.

1006
01:05:45,444 --> 01:05:47,101
为什么要救这只熊
Why'd you save the teddy...?

1007
01:05:47,136 --> 01:05:48,175
什么
What?

1010
01:06:05,954 --> 01:06:07,410
你到底在干什么 弗兰克
What the hell are you doin' Frank?

1011
01:06:07,445 --> 01:06:08,884
你知道我不能来这 如果有人看到...
You know I can't be here. What if somebody saw...

1012
01:06:08,919 --> 01:06:10,736
海扁王那个小杂种
That little motherfucker, Kick - Ass,

1013
01:06:10,771 --> 01:06:13,638
烧了我的仓库还杀了我的人 吉甘特
burned down my warehouse and killed my men, Gigante.

1014
01:06:13,673 --> 01:06:15,882
等等 慢点 海扁王?
Whoa...wait,wait, slow down. Kick - Ass?

1015
01:06:15,917 --> 01:06:18,057
- 你确定? - 你得帮我 维克
- You sure? - You gotta help me, Vic

1016
01:06:18,092 --> 01:06:20,197
我儿子也在里面 还没找到他
My son was there and he's still missing

1017
01:06:21,219 --> 01:06:25,244
他们都死了 仓库里所有的人都死了
They're all dead! Everbody in the warehouse is dead!

1018
01:06:26,568 --> 01:06:28,904
把枪放下 维克 他是克里斯
Put the gun down, Vic, it's Chris!

1019
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:31,100
克里斯是红旋风?
Chris is Red Mist?!

1020
01:06:31,135 --> 01:06:33,736
你该担心的不是红旋风 而是海扁王
It's not Red Mist you gotta worry about, it's Kickass!

1021
01:06:33,771 --> 01:06:36,338
不不不 海扁王就是一个怪客而已
No, no, no, it's not. Kick - ass is some kinda geek, Dad.

1022
01:06:36,373 --> 01:06:37,735
你不必担心他
You don't have to worry about him

1023
01:06:37,770 --> 01:06:39,341
来看看这个
You need to watch this!

1024
01:06:41,656 --> 01:06:42,912
咋了 这是干什么的
Why? What does it do?

1025
01:06:42,947 --> 01:06:44,134
你他妈是在玩我
You're fucking kidding me

1026
01:06:44,169 --> 01:06:46,442
怎么 他妈的 给我坐下
What? Goddamit, just sit down

1027
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:54,002
你在干什么 那是什么玩意
What are you doing? What the hell is that thing?

1028
01:06:54,043 --> 01:06:56,170
我小时候 你买这个监视保姆的
You bought this to spy on the nanny when I was a kid,

1029
01:06:56,205 --> 01:06:57,422
还记得吗
don't you remember?

1030
01:06:57,901 --> 01:06:59,392
怎么 你放到仓库了?
Why? You put it in the warehouse?

1031
01:06:59,427 --> 01:07:00,265
是的 我觉得
Yeah. I thought it'd be cool

1032
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:02,833
把海扁王的素颜照放到网上很酷 是吧
to put the unmasking of Kick - Ass on the Internet, okay?

1033
01:07:03,626 --> 01:07:04,679
看看
Watch.

1034
01:07:09,246 --> 01:07:10,024
我让她坐我腿上
So I tell her to sit in my lap

1035
01:07:10,059 --> 01:07:11,686
把脑子里想到的第一件事说出来
and talk about the first thing that comes up.

1036
01:07:17,431 --> 01:07:19,183
"守住前门 他在路上了"
"Let's get the front he's on his way"

1037
01:08:38,325 --> 01:08:39,722
他到底是谁
Who the hell is this guy?

1038
01:08:40,535 --> 01:08:41,860
我不知道 老爸
I don't know, Dad

1039
01:08:42,871 --> 01:08:45,499
但是海扁王说我们不是镇上唯一的超级英雄
But, Kick - Ass told me we're not the only super heroes in town.

1040
01:08:45,534 --> 01:08:47,083
也许他知道是谁
Maybe he knows who this guy is.

1041
01:08:49,523 --> 01:08:51,411
我要把这儿锁起来
I want this place locked down.

1042
01:08:52,307 --> 01:08:55,071
别让人进来 也别让人出去
Nobody comes in, nobody goes out

1043
01:08:56,541 --> 01:08:58,320
直到有人找到这个混蛋
Not until somebody finds this cocksucker

1044
01:08:58,355 --> 01:09:01,233
把他打得他妈都不认识
and blows his fuckin' lungs out through his chest.

1045
01:09:05,602 --> 01:09:10,013
他们找上你了 听见了吗 他们找上你了
They're on to you. did you hear me? They're on to you

1046
01:09:10,048 --> 01:09:12,161
我还以为他们在找海扁王呢
I thought they were looking for Kick - Ass?

1047
01:09:12,599 --> 01:09:15,977
不是了 吉甘特刚给我们放了段小电影
Not anymore. Gigante just put on a little movie show for us.

1048
01:09:16,012 --> 01:09:17,767
新的超级英雄

1049
01:09:17,802 --> 01:09:21,211
在仓库里干掉一帮阿米克的人

1050
01:09:21,246 --> 01:09:23,307
让我大胆猜测一下 那就是你?
I'm gonna take a wild guess that was you?

1051
01:09:24,214 --> 01:09:27,097
- 我把所有的摄像头都砸了 - 显然没有
- I killed all the cameras. - Apparently not.

1052
01:09:27,132 --> 01:09:29,981
听着 兄弟 你得销声匿迹 快藏起来
Look bro, you need to get ghost. Hide yourself quick.

1053
01:09:30,731 --> 01:09:31,732

It's time for Frank D'Amico to go bye - bye.

1059
01:09:57,518 --> 01:09:59,051
一切都失控了
Everything was out of control

1060
01:09:59,802 --> 01:10:01,648
我不知道该做什么
I didn't know what the hell to do

1061
01:10:02,169 --> 01:10:03,462
你还好吗 戴夫
You OK, Dave?

1062
01:10:03,497 --> 01:10:04,755
你看上去很累
You look tired

1063
01:10:05,057 --> 01:10:06,138
要不今晚早睡觉?
Gonna have an early night tonight, maybe?

1064
01:10:06,173 --> 01:10:08,582
我也找不到人可以聊天
And there was no one I could talk to about it

1065
01:10:09,051 --> 01:10:10,156
喂
Hello

1066

我从未感觉如此孤单

我一直梦想成为超级英雄

但这一切...简直是恶梦
But this...was a nightmare

1070
01:10:30,374 --> 01:10:33,106
该脱下这身愚蠢的行头了
It was time to stop wearing this stupid costume

1071
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:39,717
但我还需要穿着它再做一件事
But there was one last thing I needed it for

1086
01:11:23,813 --> 01:11:25,054
你为什么穿成海扁王的样子
Why are you dressed as Kick - Ass?

1087
01:11:25,089 --> 01:11:26,724
因为我就是海扁王
Because I am Kick - Ass.

1088
01:11:26,759 --> 01:11:28,359
说什么胡话呢

我知道 如果能让你感觉好一点

楼下有我妈妈设的防盗警铃
My mom has the burglar alarm set downstairs.

1104
01:12:26,181 --> 01:12:28,211

01:12:40,442 --> 01:12:42,308
你可以留下来
You could just stay.

1107
01:12:43,622 --> 01:12:44,800
留下?
stay?

1108
01:12:45,843 --> 01:12:46,990
像上次过夜看电视那样?
Like when we have a sleepover?

1109
01:12:54,247 --> 01:12:56,708
抱歉 我不想吓你的
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you

1110
01:13:29,376 --> 01:13:32,542
我们得到上面去
We gotta get over the top of it

1111
01:13:32,577 --> 01:13:35,497
再下去 直入中央
and then into it right in the middle of her.

1112
01:13:35,532 --> 01:13:37,103
爸爸 我想我找到了
Daddy, I think I found one.

1113
01:13:37,561 --> 01:13:40,231
真是完美 而且他们能在3天内送来
It's perfect. And they can deliver it in three days...

1114
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:44,346
但价值30万美元
And it's three hundred thousand dollars.

1115
01:13:44,381 --> 01:13:49,334
那你觉得还应该把钱花在哪儿 天哪
Can you think of anything else you'd rather spend it on? Oh my Gosh

1116
01:13:49,688 --> 01:13:51,659
真酷
that is cool!

1117
01:13:51,878 --> 01:13:53,004
是啊
Yeah.

1118
01:13:53,723 --> 01:13:55,194
加入购物车
Add to shopping cart

1119
01:13:55,871 --> 01:13:56,998
好吧
OK

1120
01:13:57,654 --> 01:13:59,427
("红旋风"漫画即将面世)

1121
01:13:59,625 --> 01:14:02,962
海扁王跟红旋风打 你觉得谁能赢
Out of Kickass and Red Mist, who do you think would win in a fight?

1122
01:14:03,285 --> 01:14:05,537
他们为什么要打 好傻
Why are they fighting? That seems stupid

1123
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:07,119
你怎么想
What do you think?

1124
01:14:07,154 --> 01:14:09,614
不知道 但我觉得海扁王更可爱
I don't know. But I think Kick - Ass is cuter.

1125
01:14:10,313 --> 01:14:11,053
真的吗
Really?

1126
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:16,152
拿我来说 如果有机会 我绝对会把他蛋蛋打飞
I, for one, would definitely fuck his brains out if I got the chance.

1127
01:14:18,175 --> 01:14:19,489
你会吗?
You would?

1128
01:14:19,524 --> 01:14:20,803
当然
Definitely.

1129
01:14:21,126 --> 01:14:24,973
你想不想去看凯特・哈里森的新片
Do you...uh, feel like checking out that new Kate Hudson movie where...

1130
01:14:25,008 --> 01:14:26,190
她演个鞋子设计师的那个
she's like a shoe designer kind of guy?

1131
01:14:26,225 --> 01:14:27,591
我觉得能赶上下一场, 如果我们走...
I think we can make the next showing if we leave...

1132
01:14:27,626 --> 01:14:28,560
好啊
Hell yeah.

1133
01:14:31,918 --> 01:14:33,096
我想他们没请我们
I guess we're not invited

1134
01:14:34,702 --> 01:14:36,193
好了 知道吗 过来
Alright..you know what, come here

1135
01:14:36,746 --> 01:14:39,238
我现在给你点一道大餐
I'm going to request a great meal for you right now

1136
01:14:40,061 --> 01:14:40,975
忽然之间 我明白了
Suddenly, I understood

1137
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:44,187
为什么超级英雄只存在于漫画里
why super heroes only exist in the comics

1138
01:14:44,222 --> 01:14:46,870
我想过人们为什么不愿为陌生人出生入死
I doubt why people didn't risk their life for strangers

1139
01:14:47,725 --> 01:14:49,685
因为 我人生中的第一次
because, for the first time in my life

1140
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:51,646
我有了值得活下去的东西
I had something to worth living for

1141
01:14:52,699 --> 01:14:54,211
害怕失去的东西
Something to lose

1142
01:14:56,296 --> 01:14:58,263
凯蒂担心我会受伤
Katie was worried about me getting hurt,

1143
01:14:58,298 --> 01:15:01,103
所以我保证再也不当海扁王了
so I promised her my Kick - Ass days were over.

1144
01:15:01,138 --> 01:15:02,622
而真相是
And the truth was,

1145
01:15:02,657 --> 01:15:04,488
我根本不怀念那段日子
I hardly missed it at all.

1146
01:15:04,523 --> 01:15:07,641
我都一周没上那网页了
I hadn't even checked the web site for, like, a week.

1147
01:15:10,947 --> 01:15:12,730
好的 我走了
Ok...I'm off then.

1148
01:15:13,783 --> 01:15:15,228
今晚不陪凯蒂?
No Katie tonight?

1149
01:15:15,263 --> 01:15:18,756
明天 她周三要当志愿者
Tomorrow. Wednesdays she does one of her volunteer things.

1150
01:15:19,768 --> 01:15:22,156
你简直变了一个人 知道吗
You seem like a different guy, you know that?

1151
01:15:22,573 --> 01:15:23,539
你妈妈一定会高兴
Your mom would've been so happy

1152
01:15:23,574 --> 01:15:25,503
看到你不做缩头乌龟了
to see you out of your shell like this.

1153
01:15:26,827 --> 01:15:28,162
晚安
Have a good night

1154
01:15:31,081 --> 01:15:32,645
(红旋风: 你去哪儿了 我得见你)

1155
01:15:39,183 --> 01:15:41,717
- 嘿 宝贝 - 嗨 怎么了
- Hey, baby - Hi, what's going on?

1156
01:15:42,499 --> 01:15:44,470
我要再当一次海扁王
I gotta do that Kick - Ass thing

1157
01:15:44,505 --> 01:15:45,456
什么
What?

1158
01:15:45,491 --> 01:15:46,906
你不是退出了吗
I thought you were done with that?

1159
01:15:46,941 --> 01:15:49,464
这是最后一次 我向天发誓
This is the last time. I totally swear...

1160
01:15:50,569 --> 01:15:51,977
我担心你
I worry about you

1161
01:15:53,343 --> 01:15:54,820
希望你不要担心
I wish you wouldn't worry.

1162
01:15:54,855 --> 01:15:57,368
我控制不住, 真的 因为我...
I can't help it. I do. Because I...

1163
01:15:59,109 --> 01:16:01,101
我很在乎你
I...care about you a lot.

1164
01:16:04,636 --> 01:16:06,533
我也很在乎你
I...care about you a lot, too.

1165
01:16:37,064 --> 01:16:38,384
最好事态真的很严重 伙计
This better be serious, Dude,

1166
01:16:38,419 --> 01:16:41,245
因为我向我女朋友保证我不玩了
because I promised my girlfriend that I'm done with all this shit.

1167
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:44,071
我们俩都快死了 对你来说够严重了吧
How about both of us being dead? Is that serious enough for you?

1168
01:16:44,373 --> 01:16:46,757
- 死? - 怎么死
- Dead? - How?

1169
01:16:46,792 --> 01:16:48,951
事实证明仓库里那些死尸
Well it turns out those dead guys from the warehouse

1170
01:16:48,986 --> 01:16:50,788
有些混蛋朋友
had some bad motherfuckers for friends

1171
01:16:50,823 --> 01:16:52,555
他们认为是我们做的
and they think we did that shit.

1172
01:16:52,590 --> 01:16:54,546
有人想要我们的命 伙计
There's a price on our heads, man.

1173
01:16:54,581 --> 01:16:57,115
要我们的命? 这是哪儿 西部荒野吗
A price on our heads? What is this, the wild west?

1174
01:16:57,150 --> 01:16:58,676
我没骗你玩 伙计
I'm not messing with you, dude!

1175
01:16:58,711 --> 01:17:00,723
他们找到了我家 他们砸了我家
They found out where I lived! They trashed my placed!

1176
01:17:00,758 --> 01:17:02,735
我他妈完了 下一个就是你!
I'm fucking screwed! And you're gonna be next, Okay?!

1177
01:17:02,770 --> 01:17:03,997
什么
What?

1178
01:17:07,605 --> 01:17:08,814
妈的
Shit

1179
01:17:10,003 --> 01:17:11,421
我们要怎么办
What do we do?

1180
01:17:14,518 --> 01:17:17,396
记得你说过还有别的超级英雄
Remember you mentioned that there were other super heroes

1181
01:17:17,782 --> 01:17:18,793
是的
Yeah.

1182
01:17:19,533 --> 01:17:21,462
你觉得他们会帮我们吗
Well, do you think they can help us?

1183
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:33,318
热可可 多加棉花糖
Hot chocolate, extra Marsh - mellows.

1184
01:17:36,363 --> 01:17:38,844
比照片上更酷
Wow it's even cooler than in the picture

1185
01:17:39,793 --> 01:17:40,999
孩子
child

1186
01:17:41,034 --> 01:17:44,225
因为照片里没有格林机枪
you know because in the picture it didn't have Gatling guns

1187
01:17:44,569 --> 01:17:45,778
漂亮
Nice job.

1188
01:17:46,216 --> 01:17:47,530
我要上床睡觉了 好吗
I'm gonna get ready for bed, Okay?

1189
01:17:47,565 --> 01:17:48,698
好的 宝贝
Okay baby doll.

1190
01:17:49,344 --> 01:17:50,940
好梦 谢谢
Sleep tight Thanks

1191
01:17:51,722 --> 01:17:52,650
海扁王?
Kick - Ass?

1192
01:17:52,685 --> 01:17:53,693
(休假中)

1193
01:17:53,953 --> 01:17:56,565
穿好衣服 我告诉他去B避难所见面
You go get dressed I'l tell him to meet us at safehouse B

1194
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:59,177
回来再喝热可可 好的 老爸
We'll have our hot - chocolate when we get back. Okay daddy.

1195
01:17:59,212 --> 01:18:00,178
来
C'mon.

1196
01:18:06,966 --> 01:18:08,009
(超级老爹: B避难所见)

1197
01:18:10,595 --> 01:18:11,846
不 不
No..no

1198
01:18:12,138 --> 01:18:13,306
知道是哪儿吗 好了
you know where that is? I got it.

1199
01:18:13,341 --> 01:18:14,505
我输进GPS里
I'll just put it in the GPS

1200
01:18:15,256 --> 01:18:16,528
好的 走
Alright, let's go

1201
01:18:18,301 --> 01:18:19,229
妈的
Shit

1202
01:20:04,386 --> 01:20:05,352
呃
Well

1203
01:20:05,387 --> 01:20:09,360
你来了 还有红旋风

1204
01:20:14,709 --> 01:20:15,835
很高兴见到你
Pleasure to meet you.

1205
01:20:16,231 --> 01:20:17,493
我的荣幸 先生
Good to meet you sir.

1206
01:20:17,826 --> 01:20:19,328
请进
Please, come in

1207
01:20:20,079 --> 01:20:21,340
你先请
After you

1208
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:26,377
风行萝莉 要有礼貌 宝贝
Hit Girl, manners..honey.

1209
01:20:29,254 --> 01:20:30,683
嗨 我是风行萝莉
Hi, I'm Hit Girl

1210
01:20:36,272 --> 01:20:37,179
不
No!

1211
01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:43,348
他是我这边的 他是好人
Hey he's with me, he's O.K.!

1212
01:20:43,383 --> 01:20:45,635
闭上鸟嘴 孩子 你爸才是老大
Shut the fuck up, kid! Your daddy's the boss!

1213
01:20:45,670 --> 01:20:47,377
- 少给我下命令 - 妈的 不
- You don't order shit! - Shit! No!...

1214
01:20:47,412 --> 01:20:49,629
他是我的人!
He's with me!...

1215
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:50,240
放他走
Let him go!...

1216
01:20:50,275 --> 01:20:52,680
滚出去 给我滚出去
Get outta here, get the fuck outta here

1217
01:20:52,715 --> 01:20:54,571
妈妈咪呀 我一直想有这么一把
Hotdamn, I always wanted one of these...

1218
01:20:54,606 --> 01:20:56,000
- 你真要拿走? - 是的
- Seriously you're gonna take that? - Yes

1219
01:20:56,396 --> 01:20:57,293
走吧
Come on.

1220
01:21:02,277 --> 01:21:05,676
知道当超级英雄要花多少钱么
You know what being a super hero actually costs?

1221
01:21:05,711 --> 01:21:07,251
你正巧惹了一堆麻烦
You happen to be in a lot of trouble here.

1222
01:21:07,286 --> 01:21:09,148
海扁王 快带他们走
Kick - Ass! Get em outta here!

1223
01:21:12,193 --> 01:21:13,444
海扁王 对不起
Kick Ass I'm sorry

1224
01:21:15,144 --> 01:21:16,155
进去
Get in there

1225
01:21:29,356 --> 01:21:30,774
你最好炒了这个混蛋
You better fire this asshole!

1226
01:21:31,515 --> 01:21:32,672
别理他
Ignore him.

1227
01:21:33,965 --> 01:21:35,081
火箭筒?
A Bazooka?

1228
01:21:37,719 --> 01:21:38,480
好了
OK

1229
01:21:39,064 --> 01:21:39,999
我们说好的 老爸
We had a deal, dad.

1230
01:21:40,034 --> 01:21:42,710
我帮你抓到罪魁祸首
We had a fucking deal that would get you the guy who did it.

1231
01:21:42,745 --> 01:21:46,488
我只要你放海扁王走 他根本没有做错
All I'm asking is you let Kick - Ass go! He didn't do anything wrong!

1232
01:21:46,523 --> 01:21:49,856
克里斯 你得学会从我的角度看事 好吗
Chris, you gotta look at this from my point of view, Okay?

1233
01:21:50,221 --> 01:21:52,848
我要向人们发布公众信息
I gotta send a public service message to the people out there

1234
01:21:53,453 --> 01:21:56,004
说当超级英雄有害健康
that being a superhero is bad for your health.

1235
01:21:56,039 --> 01:21:58,688
至于那个大混蛋呢 没人知道他是谁
And the big motherfucker? Nobody knows who he is.

1236
01:21:58,723 --> 01:21:59,893
是的 但这不公平
Yeah, but that's not fair!

1237
01:21:59,928 --> 01:22:01,837
人生本来就不公平 孩子 接受吧
Life's not fair, kid. Get over it.

1238
01:22:02,462 --> 01:22:03,703
你要对他们怎么样
What are you gonna do with them?

1239
01:22:04,683 --> 01:22:06,925
你真的想接我的班?
You really want to be a part of my business?

1240
01:22:09,845 --> 01:22:10,675
是的
Yeah.

1241
01:22:10,710 --> 01:22:13,035
那就坐下 闭嘴
Then sit down, shut up

1242
01:22:13,233 --> 01:22:14,380
好好看着
and watch.

1243
01:22:23,014 --> 01:22:24,651

1247
01:22:29,827 --> 01:22:31,116
边看边学
Watch and learn

1248
01:22:31,377 --> 01:22:32,853
欢迎观看网上直播的爆炸性新闻
Welcome back to breaking news

1249
01:22:32,888 --> 01:22:35,725
纽约的超级英雄

1251
01:22:37,451 --> 01:22:39,037
即将进行现场演出

Rumors have it that this will be Kick - Ass' farewell appearance

1253
01:22:42,224 --> 01:22:44,807
他将退出打击犯罪的生涯
that he will announce his retirement from crime fighting

1254
01:22:44,842 --> 01:22:46,934
人们正在口口相传
but as word - of - mouth continues to spread,

1255
01:22:46,969 --> 01:22:48,379
网络服务供应商预测
internet providers are predicting that

1256
01:22:48,414 --> 01:22:52,398
这将是网络史上最受关注的现场直播

1257
01:22:53,232 --> 01:22:54,233
嘿 戴夫哪儿去了

1260
01:22:58,918 --> 01:23:00,134
显然的

1261
01:23:01,177 --> 01:23:02,554
要不我为啥来
Why else would I be here?

1262
01:23:02,887 --> 01:23:06,213
虽然不知道这场表演是谁在幕后
With no idea as to who is behind the broadcast of this show

1263
01:23:06,248 --> 01:23:09,300
但可以看出服务器严重拥堵
But we could see wide spread server crashes

1264
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:11,875
戴夫 为啥不告诉我你要这么干

1265
01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:13,220

1277
01:23:59,777 --> 01:24:01,546
知道什么是静音K吗
You know what a silent "K" is?

1278
01:24:01,581 --> 01:24:04,793
就是单词以K打头 但不发音
That's when "K" is at the beginning of the but you don't pronounce it

1279
01:24:04,828 --> 01:24:06,670
像在"knuckle duster(关节式手套)"这个词里一样
like in the word knuckle duster

1280
01:24:06,705 --> 01:24:08,724
让他们看看关节式手套能干什么
Show them what knuckle duster can do, Guy.

1281
01:24:09,756 --> 01:24:10,952
一定很疼
Oh that must've hurt.

1282
01:24:10,987 --> 01:24:13,114
另一边再来一下
Let's see that again on the other side, go.

1283
01:24:13,149 --> 01:24:14,695
好了 看吧
Oh Yeah, look at this

1284
01:24:14,730 --> 01:24:18,213
在法语里 "棍"这个单词是这么说的
Now in France they say the word stick like this...

1285
01:24:18,248 --> 01:24:19,596
噢 Ba - ton
Ba - ton.

1286
01:24:19,631 --> 01:24:21,118
我们有海扁王的棍子
We have some of Kick - Ass' batons.

1287
01:24:21,153 --> 01:24:22,310
给你们看看能用来干什么
We're gonna show you what they can do.

1288
01:24:22,345 --> 01:24:23,697
上吧 孩子们
Go ahead boys.

1289
01:24:27,503 --> 01:24:29,672
在美国 我们用哪种棍子呢
In America we say stick like this...

1290
01:24:29,707 --> 01:24:31,611
棒球棍
Baseball Bat

1291
01:24:33,071 --> 01:24:34,322
可以打膝盖
For hittin' knees..

1292
01:24:34,357 --> 01:24:35,705
手
hands...

1293
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:38,253
打球球也很好用
It's also good for hittin' balls.

1294
01:24:40,057 --> 01:24:44,103
我们也不爱单打独斗 我们爱打群架
We don't do 'em individually, we do 'em all together.

1295
01:24:44,138 --> 01:24:45,750
先生们 请
Gentlemen please. Yeah.

1296
01:24:46,835 --> 01:24:48,170
看着可真疼啊
Oh this looks very painful...

1297
01:24:52,351 --> 01:24:54,561
因为图像太过血腥
Due to the distressing nature of the images

1298
01:24:54,596 --> 01:24:55,329
我们现在不能
we are unable to

1299
01:24:55,364 --> 01:24:58,836
在网上进行现场直播了
broadcast the events currently streaming live on the Internet

1300
01:24:59,566 --> 01:25:00,870
不 不
No No

1301
01:25:02,997 --> 01:25:04,568
之前的误导信息说明
Misguided miscalculations suggest that

1302
01:25:04,603 --> 01:25:06,903
这可能是场骗局或是宣传噱头
this may be some kind of hoax or publicity stunt.

1303
01:25:06,938 --> 01:25:10,348
现在可以清楚的是人质已受重伤
It is now clear that the hostages are in genuine danger

1304
01:25:10,383 --> 01:25:12,221
所有的迹象都显示
That all signs point to the intentions

1305
01:25:12,256 --> 01:25:15,311
一会儿将出人命
to stage a live execution in the next few minutes

1306
01:25:28,710 --> 01:25:32,443
我穿着金属板 神经末梢也不敏感
Even with my metal plates and my fucked up nerve endings,

1307
01:25:32,478 --> 01:25:33,851
但我得告诉你们
I've gotta tell ya,

1308
01:25:33,886 --> 01:25:35,999
真的很疼
that hurt.

1309
01:25:37,563 --> 01:25:38,856
看到了么
There can you see

1310
01:25:39,283 --> 01:25:41,087
对 它是寂静杀手
Yes, the silent killer

1311
01:25:41,108 --> 01:25:44,778
但这样的痛苦还远远比不上抛下我拥有的一切
But not half as much as the idea of leaving everything behind.

1312
01:25:45,362 --> 01:25:46,572
凯蒂
Katie

1313
01:25:46,905 --> 01:25:48,240
我爸爸
My dad.

1314
01:25:48,615 --> 01:25:49,877
托德和马蒂
Todd and Marty

1315
01:25:50,544 --> 01:25:52,161
还有我没机会做的事
And all the things I'd never do.

1316
01:25:52,765 --> 01:25:55,222
比如学开车
Like learn to drive.

1317
01:25:55,257 --> 01:25:57,948
还有看看我和凯蒂的孩子长啥样
Or see what me and Katie's kids would look like.

1318
01:25:57,983 --> 01:26:00,002
我还没看到"迷失"的结局
Or find out what happened on Lost.

1319
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:02,730
如果你自我安慰
And if you're reassuring yourself

1320
01:26:02,765 --> 01:26:05,622
因为我还在说话 你就认为我会挺过去
that I'm gonna make it through this since I'm talking to you now,

1321
01:26:06,936 --> 01:26:08,698
别耍聪明了
quit being such a smart ass.

1322
01:26:09,209 --> 01:26:11,847
伙计 你没看过"罪恶之城"?
Hell dude. You've never seen Sin City?

1323
01:26:12,202 --> 01:26:15,121
"日落大道""美国丽人"?
Sunset Boulevard? American Beauty?

1324
01:26:15,893 --> 01:26:22,097
还有这个...勇士们...是火
And this,...for all you brave men out there...is fire.

1325
01:26:31,210 --> 01:26:33,150
火 火很好啊
Fire, Fire's good

1326
01:26:34,401 --> 01:26:36,695
火是我们的朋友
Fire is our friend

1327
01:26:45,026 --> 01:26:46,194
先生们
Gentlemen

1328
01:26:48,415 --> 01:26:49,729
死期到了
Time to die.

1329
01:26:55,901 --> 01:26:57,017
怎么回...
What the...

1330
01:27:56,149 --> 01:27:57,473
快点火
Find me a lighter

1331
01:28:06,868 --> 01:28:08,026
我来
I've got it

1332
01:28:22,050 --> 01:28:23,068
不
No!

1333
01:28:23,103 --> 01:28:25,095
快躲起来 孩子
Take cover, child!

1334
01:28:30,548 --> 01:28:34,604
现在换成氪晶体!
Now switch to Kryptonite!

1335
01:29:05,521 --> 01:29:08,034
发射 2轮子弹 再来!
Eject, 2 rounds and relay!

1336
01:29:56,374 --> 01:29:57,938
表演结束了 禽兽
Show's over mother - fuckers.

1337
01:30:03,276 --> 01:30:04,357
耶!
Yeah!

1338
01:30:04,392 --> 01:30:06,102
我想我爱上她了 伙计
I think I'm in love with her, dude.

1339
01:30:06,592 --> 01:30:08,813
她看起来只有11岁 但是...
She looks like she's about 11 years old, but...

1340
01:30:08,848 --> 01:30:10,639
我可以等 我庄严地起誓
I can wait. I solemnly vow

1341
01:30:10,674 --> 01:30:12,431
我将把我的初夜留给她
to save myself for her.

1342
01:30:13,443 --> 01:30:15,351
我知道那一定很不容易
I can see that this can be really difficult for you.

1343
01:30:15,386 --> 01:30:16,414
还好吗
Are you OK?

1344
01:30:17,082 --> 01:30:18,948
是的 哇

Good job.

1346
01:30:47,247 --> 01:30:49,979
我为你骄傲 洋娃娃

1347

1348
01:30:56,986 --> 01:30:57,873
是的
Yes

1349
01:30:59,770 --> 01:31:03,107
我中弹了 老爸 比你打我时疼多了
Getting shot, daddy, hurt a lot more than when you did it.

1350
01:31:04,671 --> 01:31:08,675
那是因为我用的低速手枪 孩子
That's because I used low - velocity rounds, child.

1351
01:31:13,263 --> 01:31:15,484
你是全世界最棒的老爸
You're the kindest daddy in the whole world

1352
01:31:15,953 --> 01:31:17,298

晚安

1357
01:32:00,446 --> 01:32:01,822
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

1358
01:32:02,875 --> 01:32:04,439
我是说 你的真名
I mean, your real name

1359
01:32:04,867 --> 01:32:07,546
超级英雄从不透露她的真名
A super hero never reveals her true identity.

1360
01:32:07,581 --> 01:32:09,809
听着 你不能继续...
What look, you can't go on...

1361
01:32:11,749 --> 01:32:13,855
不管你以前过的是什么日子
However you lived before...

1362
01:32:17,713 --> 01:32:19,006
都过去了
It's over.

1363
01:32:21,143 --> 01:32:22,645
还有别人吗
Is there anybody else?

1364
01:32:23,041 --> 01:32:24,007
别的亲人
Any other family, or?

1365
01:32:24,042 --> 01:32:25,763
我能照顾自己
I can take care of myself.

1366
01:32:27,212 --> 01:32:29,204
我救了你的小命
I saved your sorry ass!

1367
01:32:29,829 --> 01:32:31,080
钱呢
what about money?

1368
01:32:31,737 --> 01:32:34,208
好了 因为你得有点远见
Alright, cause you've got to think long - term

1369
01:32:34,243 --> 01:32:36,680
我箱子里有3百万美元
I've got three million dollars in a suitcase!

1370
01:32:37,618 --> 01:32:40,058
对你来说 够长远了吧
That long - term enough for ya?

1371
01:32:42,717 --> 01:32:44,375
不全是关于钱
It's not all about the money,

1372
01:32:46,179 --> 01:32:47,628
我欠你的
I owe you

1373
01:32:49,338 --> 01:32:51,278
要不是你 我就死了
If not for you, I'd be dead.

1374
01:32:52,529 --> 01:32:54,187
要不是你
if it wasn't for you

1375
01:32:56,095 --> 01:32:57,795
我爸爸也不会死
my dad wouldn't be.

1376
01:33:14,791 --> 01:33:15,719
听着
Look

1377
01:33:16,887 --> 01:33:20,369
收拾你的东西 去我那里
pack up whatever you need and we'll go back to my place.

1378
01:33:21,923 --> 01:33:23,831
我想我得清理一下
I just need to clean up, I think?

1379
01:34:20,335 --> 01:34:22,615
我是说 收拾睡衣啦
Woah. I meant, like pajamas

1380
01:34:22,650 --> 01:34:25,705
还有衣服什么的 你不能把这个带去我家
and clothes and stuff. You can't take that stuff to my house.

1381
01:34:25,740 --> 01:34:27,676
知道我爸爸最想要什么吗
You know what my dad would have really wanted?

1382
01:34:33,286 --> 01:34:35,788
他会希望我们完成使命
He would have wanted me to finish what we started.

1383
01:34:37,269 --> 01:34:39,198
我正打算这么干
And that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

1384
01:34:56,309 --> 01:34:58,499
这是弗兰克・阿米克的地盘吗
Is this Frank D'Amico's place?

1385
01:34:59,249 --> 01:35:00,292
那么多保安
All that security

1386
01:35:01,377 --> 01:35:02,874
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

1387
01:35:02,909 --> 01:35:05,151
我妈妈已经白白死去了
My mom already died for nothing.

1388
01:35:06,236 --> 01:35:09,134
所以 我一定不能让爸爸也白白牺牲
So, I'm sure as hell not gonna let my dad die for nothing too.

1389
01:35:11,699 --> 01:35:13,462
你不能孤军奋战
You can't do this on your own.

1390
01:35:15,641 --> 01:35:16,882
不错
Exactly

1391
01:35:19,624 --> 01:35:21,490
你想接我爸的班?
You wanna deal with owing my dad?

1392
01:35:23,419 --> 01:35:26,235
那就闭上鸟嘴拿起武器
Then shut the hell up and pick your weapon.

1393
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:36,672
这不是那什么吧
Is that what I think it is?

1394
01:35:37,819 --> 01:35:39,035
你他妈说对了
Damn straight.

1395
01:35:39,070 --> 01:35:41,559
你最好看看说明
Oh you better start reading the instructions,

1396
01:35:41,594 --> 01:35:45,222
因为再过5分钟你就要用它了
'cause you're gonna be using it in about five minutes.

1397
01:35:52,438 --> 01:35:56,098
听着 你们还有5分钟可以玩 回到岗位上
Yo listen up, you've got 5 minutes and I want you back on your post

1398
01:35:56,133 --> 01:35:57,944
收拾干净
and don't leave a mess

1399
01:36:12,364 --> 01:36:13,303
一切都好吗
Everything okay?

1400
01:36:13,365 --> 01:36:14,689
一切都好 头儿
Things alright, boss

1401
01:36:17,036 --> 01:36:18,401
不敢相信我的枪又回来了
Can't believe I got my gun back

1402
01:36:18,436 --> 01:36:19,430
看
Look at that

1403
01:36:19,465 --> 01:36:20,758
你知道那不是...
You know it's not that..

1404
01:36:25,429 --> 01:36:26,566
让她进来
Let her in

1405
01:36:29,944 --> 01:36:31,181
是个小孩
That's a little kid

1406
01:36:31,216 --> 01:36:32,614
你是怎么回事
What's the matter with you?

1407
01:36:37,285 --> 01:36:38,567
你没事吧 宝贝
You okay, sweetheart?

1408
01:36:39,266 --> 01:36:43,426
不 我找不到爸爸妈妈了
No, I lost my mommy and daddy.

1409
01:36:43,461 --> 01:36:45,418
她找不到爸爸妈妈了
she lost her mommy and daddy

1410
01:36:46,596 --> 01:36:48,108
想用我电话吗
You wanna use my cell phone?

1411
01:36:49,787 --> 01:36:51,278
你能记住号码吗
Now can you remember the number?

1412
01:37:35,875 --> 01:37:38,002
我真的做过超级英雄吗
Had I ever been a real superhero?

1413
01:37:39,128 --> 01:37:40,761
我对这个世界做过最大的贡献就是
The most I'd ever had to offer the world was

1414
01:37:40,796 --> 01:37:45,280
善意和被夸大的海扁能力
good intentions and a slightly elevated capacity to take a kicking.

1415
01:37:47,032 --> 01:37:50,702
没有权力 就没有责任
With no power comes no responsibility.

1416
01:37:51,703 --> 01:37:52,861
只不过
Except

1417
01:37:53,851 --> 01:37:55,342
那不是真理
that wasn't true.

1418
01:38:44,099 --> 01:38:45,278
妈的

1419

等等 他妈的 所有人都死了
Wait, fuck this! And, everybody's dead!

1421
01:40:38,766 --> 01:40:41,008
她在柜台后面 她没子弹了
She's behind the counter, she's out of ammo.

1422
01:40:56,419 --> 01:40:57,702
你觉得他们抓住她了?
Do you think they got her?

1423
01:40:58,755 --> 01:41:00,183
抓不住的话 还有他呢
If they didn't he will.

1424
01:41:01,925 --> 01:41:03,207
给我出去
Get out there

1425
01:41:03,697 --> 01:41:04,667

是的 现在
Yeah, now

1427
01:41:16,814 --> 01:41:18,020
怎么回鸟事
What the fuck is going on?

1428
01:41:18,055 --> 01:41:19,994
我们困住她了 她还活着
We got her trapped she's still alive

1429
01:41:20,029 --> 01:41:21,934
那你们还在等什么
So what the hell you guys waiting for?

1430
01:41:22,278 --> 01:41:24,475
- 去抓她 - 上啊
- Go get her - Go ahead.

1431
01:41:24,510 --> 01:41:26,918
我他妈只有一支枪 我才不去
I only got one fucking gun. I'm not going in there.

1432

1434
01:41:52,903 --> 01:41:54,091

我去拿火箭筒
I'm getting the Bazooka

1436
01:41:58,877 --> 01:41:59,899
火箭筒?
Bazooka?

1437
01:42:00,462 --> 01:42:01,734
火箭筒

01:42:02,183 --> 01:42:05,154
等等 头儿 只有我 一切尽在掌控
Whoa hold it. It's only me boss. Everything is under control.

尽在掌控? 你拿的是他妈的火箭筒
Under control? You're grabbing a fucking Bazooka you dumb ass.

1440
01:42:23,527 --> 01:42:27,385
头儿 快去
Sir? Do it

1441
01:42:49,417 --> 01:42:50,773
我一直想说
I always wanted to say this...

1442
01:42:53,421 --> 01:42:55,966
跟我的小朋友打个招呼
say Hello to my little friend

1443
01:43:54,983 --> 01:43:56,015
总算完了
Holy shit

01:44:04,722 --> 01:44:06,995
这个火箭筒声音很怪诶
That is one weird sounding Bazooka

1445

挡我者死
I'll kill every single fucking guy or gal in my way

1453

我保证会照顾她
on the promise that I'd look out for her.

1473
01:50:07,929 --> 01:50:09,587
倒不是因为她需要我

他们说灵感来自于我

像一位伟人曾经说过的
like a great man once said...

1485
01:50:49,773 --> 01:50:52,140
等着吃我一弹吧(摘自蝙蝠侠中的小丑)
Wait'll they get a load of me.
