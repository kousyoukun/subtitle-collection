1
00:00:27,105 --> 00:00:30,836
<i>Guardian of the universe protecting us</i>
<i>against the forces of evil.</i>

2
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,212
<i>He can catch a bullet.</i>
<i>Halt a speeding train.</i>

3
00:00:34,212 --> 00:00:36,681
<i>And leap tall buildings in a single bound.</i>

4
00:00:36,681 --> 00:00:39,050
<i>- Up in the sky!</i>
<i>- Is it a bird? Is it a plane?</i>

5
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,187
<i>A mailman by day.</i>
<i>The city's guardian by night.</i>

6
00:00:42,187 --> 00:00:45,156
<i>Defending the citizens of New York</i>
<i>from the forces of evil.</i>

7
00:00:45,156 --> 00:00:48,360
<i>The world has been protected by a</i>
<i>group of extraordinary men and women...</i>

8
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,629
<i>... who have dedicated themselves</i>
<i>to fighting crime.</i>

9
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:52,631
<i>Mysterious traveller</i>
<i>from another dimension.</i>

10
00:00:52,631 --> 00:00:57,068
<i>He has powers far beyond the</i>
<i>capabilities of mere Earthlings.</i>

11
00:01:07,812 --> 00:01:10,372
<i>I always wondered</i>
<i>why nobody did it before me.</i>

12
00:01:12,951 --> 00:01:16,614
<i>I mean, all those comic books,</i>
<i>movies, TVshows.</i>

13
00:01:16,755 --> 00:01:19,883
<i>You'd think that one eccentric loner</i>
<i>would have made himself a costume.</i>

14
00:01:22,694 --> 00:01:25,561
<i>I mean, is everyday life</i>
<i>really so exciting?</i>

15
00:01:25,864 --> 00:01:27,766
<i>Are schools and offices so thrilling...</i>

16
00:01:27,766 --> 00:01:30,564
<i>... that I'm the only one</i>
<i>who ever fantasized about this?</i>

17
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,334
<i>Come on, be honest with yourself.</i>

18
00:01:34,906 --> 00:01:38,865
<i>At some point in our lives</i>
<i>we all wanted to be a superhero.</i>

19
00:01:54,793 --> 00:01:56,920
<i>That's not me, by the way.</i>

20
00:01:57,162 --> 00:02:00,962
<i>That's some Armenian guy with a</i>
<i>history of mental health problems.</i>

21
00:02:01,933 --> 00:02:03,025
<i>Who am I?</i>

22
00:02:03,735 --> 00:02:05,430
<i>I'm Kick-Ass.</i>

23
00:02:15,146 --> 00:02:19,173
<i>That's me... back before any of</i>
<i>this crazy shit happened.</i>

24
00:02:20,085 --> 00:02:23,577
<i>I guess I was the last person you'd</i>
<i>expect to become a superhero.</i>

25
00:02:24,856 --> 00:02:27,586
<i>I'm not saying there was anything</i>
<i>wrong with me...</i>

26
00:02:27,726 --> 00:02:29,751
<i>... but there's nothing special, either.</i>

27
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:32,654
- Asshole!
<i>- I wasn't into sports.</i>

28
00:02:32,764 --> 00:02:35,892
<i>I wasn't a mathlete</i>
<i>or a hard core gamer.</i>

29
00:02:36,267 --> 00:02:41,466
<i>I didn't have a piercing or an eating</i>
<i>disorder or 3,000 friends on MySpace.</i>

30
00:02:41,873 --> 00:02:45,673
<i>My only superpower</i>
<i>was being invisible to girls.</i>

31
00:02:46,177 --> 00:02:49,738
<i>And out of my friends, man,</i>
<i>I wasn't even the funny one.</i>

32
00:02:50,215 --> 00:02:53,378
<i>Like most people my age,</i>
<i>I just existed.</i>

33
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:05,696
Good morning, class.

34
00:03:05,797 --> 00:03:09,597
Please open your books
to Act Two, Scene Two.

35
00:03:10,402 --> 00:03:13,769
<i>Kick in my bedroom door and</i>
<i>you'll probably find me watching TV...</i>

36
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,274
<i>... or talking to my friend Todd on Skype.</i>

37
00:03:16,274 --> 00:03:18,708
<i>- You watching 'Family Guy'?</i>
- No.

38
00:03:18,843 --> 00:03:22,904
<i>Me neither. Turn on nippleslip. Com.</i>
<i>It's good.</i>

39
00:03:26,151 --> 00:03:29,348
<i>Or jerking off,</i>
<i>mostly to my English teacher.</i>

40
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:35,956
Dave Lizewski. Don't think I haven't
noticed you looking at my tits.

41
00:03:37,162 --> 00:03:41,599
Oh, I want your hands all over me,
Dave. Please.

42
00:03:43,168 --> 00:03:45,804
<i>Sure, a lot of what got me through the</i>
<i>average school day...</i>

43
00:03:45,804 --> 00:03:49,205
<i>... was making deposits in the whackoff</i>
<i>warehouse for later.</i>

44
00:03:49,307 --> 00:03:53,141
<i>Though, to be honest,</i>
<i>it didn't take much to set me off.</i>

45
00:03:54,412 --> 00:03:57,182
<i>I swear, when my hormones balance out...</i>

46
00:03:57,182 --> 00:03:59,912
<i>... shares in Kleenex are gonna take a dive, man.</i>

47
00:04:03,688 --> 00:04:07,454
Dave Lizewski. Shouldn't you be
looking at 'Hamlet' right now?

48
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:09,026
Yes, Mrs Zane.

49
00:04:11,196 --> 00:04:12,322
Sorry.

50
00:04:13,832 --> 00:04:17,233
<i>But don't get me wrong.</i>
<i>I like girls my own age, too.</i>

51
00:04:18,036 --> 00:04:21,028
<i>- Especially Katie Deauxma.</i>
- Hey, gorgeous.

52
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,832
Hey.

53
00:04:26,311 --> 00:04:27,938
Oh... no.

54
00:04:28,713 --> 00:04:30,738
You meant Erika.

55
00:04:31,249 --> 00:04:34,548
I know. I knew that.
I was just kidding.

56
00:04:35,186 --> 00:04:36,915
Okay, cool.

57
00:04:37,622 --> 00:04:38,782
Oh my God.

58
00:04:42,927 --> 00:04:44,895
Hey, look, I'm Todd's mom.

59
00:04:47,632 --> 00:04:49,566
That's funny. This is your dad.

60
00:04:50,101 --> 00:04:52,035
No, that's still my mom, actually.

61
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:55,804
Oh, the fuck!

62
00:04:56,241 --> 00:04:58,243
<i>I was just a regular guy.</i>

63
00:04:58,243 --> 00:05:03,348
<i>No radioactive spiders, no refugee</i>
<i>status from a doomed alien world.</i>

64
00:05:03,348 --> 00:05:06,484
You know what? Todd said they
do still make Count Chocula.

65
00:05:06,484 --> 00:05:08,577
They just don't sell it
at the store any more.

66
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:13,653
<i>My mother was killed by an aneurism</i>
<i>in the kitchen.</i>

67
00:05:13,825 --> 00:05:16,194
<i>As opposed to a gunman in the alley.</i>

68
00:05:16,194 --> 00:05:17,395
<i>So if you were hoping for any...</i>

69
00:05:17,395 --> 00:05:20,698
I will avenge you, mother!

70
00:05:20,698 --> 00:05:22,167
<i>... you're out of luck.</i>

71
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:24,335
<i>In the 18 months since my mother died...</i>

72
00:05:24,335 --> 00:05:28,032
<i>... the only epiphany I had was</i>
<i>realising that life just goes on.</i>

73
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:30,334
Did they change the bee's face?

74
00:05:31,342 --> 00:05:32,468
No.

75
00:05:40,518 --> 00:05:43,354
How come nobody's ever
tried to be a superhero?

76
00:05:43,354 --> 00:05:46,624
Boy, I dunno. Probably because
it's fucking impossible, dipshit.

77
00:05:46,624 --> 00:05:49,828
What, putting on a mask and helping people,
how's that impossible?

78
00:05:49,828 --> 00:05:51,462
That's not superhero, though.

79
00:05:51,462 --> 00:05:55,733
Super's like being strongerthan everybody
and flying and shit. That's just hero.

80
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:58,930
No, it's not even hero.
It's just fucking psycho.

81
00:05:59,137 --> 00:06:02,307
Hello? Bruce Wayne?
He didn't have any powers.

82
00:06:02,307 --> 00:06:04,742
Yes, but he had all the expensive shit
that doesn't exist.

83
00:06:04,742 --> 00:06:07,045
I thought you meant how come nobody
does it in real life?

84
00:06:07,045 --> 00:06:08,680
Yeah, Todd, that's what I meant.

85
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,182
Dude, if anybody did it in real life
they'd get their ass kicked.

86
00:06:11,182 --> 00:06:13,284
- They'd be dead in, like, a day.
- A day.

87
00:06:13,284 --> 00:06:15,186
Yeah, okay, I'm not saying they should do it.

88
00:06:15,186 --> 00:06:17,484
Ljust can't figure out why nobody does.

89
00:06:17,555 --> 00:06:21,159
Seriously, out of all the millions of
people who love superheroes,

90
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:23,423
you'd think one would give it a try.

91
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:26,497
Jesus, guys, does it not bug you?

92
00:06:26,497 --> 00:06:29,667
Why thousands of people wanna be
Paris Hilton and nobody wants to be Spiderman?

93
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:32,670
Yeah, what's with that?
She has, like, no tits at all.

94
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:35,206
Maybe it's a porn tape.
He doesn't have a porn tape.

95
00:06:35,206 --> 00:06:37,231
You guys never saw
'One Night In Spiderman'?

96
00:06:39,644 --> 00:06:41,009
Oooh, guess who?

97
00:06:45,016 --> 00:06:48,508
Is it me or do you kinda
feel sorry for Chris D'Amico?

98
00:06:48,686 --> 00:06:51,556
Must be terrible to have a rich dad and
everything you want.

99
00:06:51,556 --> 00:06:54,753
I wish you wouldn't have said anything
cos I feel like I'm gonna start crying...

100
00:06:55,093 --> 00:06:58,221
The fact that he's
always on his own.

101
00:06:59,497 --> 00:07:02,100
We should, like, talk to him.

102
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,735
See if he wants to hang out with us.

103
00:07:03,735 --> 00:07:05,536
Oh, I didn't say
we should talk to him, ljust...

104
00:07:05,536 --> 00:07:07,105
Think about it.
Come on, it'd be awesome.

105
00:07:07,105 --> 00:07:10,131
If he was ourfriend, noone
would everfuck with us again.

106
00:07:10,241 --> 00:07:11,242
Go on then, Todd.

107
00:07:11,242 --> 00:07:12,610
- You wanna go talk to him?
- No, no, no. No.

108
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:13,778
No, you wanna go talk to him?
I can move.

109
00:07:13,778 --> 00:07:16,338
- Dave, Dave should go.
- Dave should go.

110
00:07:16,714 --> 00:07:18,909
- Why?
- Dave, you should totally go.

111
00:07:18,983 --> 00:07:20,718
- You're a dick.
- Don't be afraid, Dave.

112
00:07:20,718 --> 00:07:21,980
You're a pussy.

113
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,859
Fuck off!

114
00:07:36,601 --> 00:07:40,298
- Did you spray anything overthere?
- I think I might have shat my pants.

115
00:07:44,108 --> 00:07:46,444
If that guy spoke to me like
that I would have kicked his ass.

116
00:07:46,444 --> 00:07:48,513
Todd, when have you ever kicked
anyone's ass?

117
00:07:48,513 --> 00:07:50,913
Whatever, man.
I would have just gone for his knees.

118
00:07:50,982 --> 00:07:52,317
Well, you're not making sense.

119
00:07:52,317 --> 00:07:54,686
Well, what I'm saying is the superior
force of Batman's Batarang

120
00:07:54,686 --> 00:07:56,721
would undoubtedly penetrate
the Joker's force field,

121
00:07:56,721 --> 00:07:58,156
leaving him totally vulnerable to the...

122
00:07:58,156 --> 00:08:01,250
- All right, and then... but, you know...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa Pussy patrol.

123
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:02,860
Phones. Money.

124
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,589
Dude, not again, come on.

125
00:08:06,497 --> 00:08:07,365
Phone.

126
00:08:07,365 --> 00:08:09,595
I don't have one
Someone else jacked it last week.

127
00:08:09,701 --> 00:08:12,203
- Pussy.
- Give me the bag.

128
00:08:12,203 --> 00:08:15,366
- It's just comics.
- Yo, you wanna get cut?

129
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,480
<i>Look at this asshole just watching.</i>

130
00:08:32,457 --> 00:08:35,620
<i>Come on, be honest with yourself.</i>

131
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,492
<i>Would you do anything differently?</i>

132
00:08:40,298 --> 00:08:43,358
<i>We see someone in trouble and</i>
<i>we wish we could help,</i>

133
00:08:43,534 --> 00:08:44,762
<i>but we don't.</i>

134
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:53,468
<i>The world I lived in...</i>
<i>heroes only existed in comic books.</i>

135
00:08:54,712 --> 00:08:59,012
<i>I guess that would have been okay</i>
<i>if bad guys were make-believe, too.</i>

136
00:09:00,084 --> 00:09:01,449
<i>But they're not.</i>

137
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,853
Frankie, I'm telling you, man,
I swear I'm not making this up.

138
00:09:06,057 --> 00:09:09,127
This fucking guy comes out of nowhere.

139
00:09:09,127 --> 00:09:12,722
Kicks our asses and steals all the coke.

140
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:16,501
- The guy that looks like Batman?
- I didn't say he looked like Batman.

141
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:19,470
You did Tre,
you said the guy looked like Batman.

142
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,539
- He said like a mask and stuff.
- And a cape.

143
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:22,540
Yeah, like Batman.

144
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,443
I didn't say "like Batman".
I never said "Batman".

145
00:09:25,443 --> 00:09:26,569
Okay.

146
00:09:27,578 --> 00:09:30,138
Let me tell you the problem
I got with that, Tre.

147
00:09:30,581 --> 00:09:34,711
Our mole with the Russians tells things
a little different.

148
00:09:35,253 --> 00:09:39,824
According to him, you sold him my coke
and you took the money.

149
00:09:39,824 --> 00:09:41,951
That's a fucking lie!

150
00:09:42,026 --> 00:09:46,297
I can't believe that you would believe
this shit from a fucking Russian, man!

151
00:09:46,297 --> 00:09:49,061
Let me see, Tre,
what's more likely, huh?

152
00:09:49,534 --> 00:09:54,839
That you're a greedy little cock-sucker
or all my coke was stolen by Superman?

153
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:56,574
- Batman.
- I never said Batman!

154
00:09:56,574 --> 00:09:57,871
Enough!

155
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:06,381
My son is waiting to go to the movies
and I ain't gonna disappoint him.

156
00:10:07,118 --> 00:10:09,018
Joe, you're in charge.

157
00:10:09,854 --> 00:10:13,255
That's gotta be the worst fucking
excuse I ever heard, Tre.

158
00:10:20,731 --> 00:10:23,868
- Sorry you had to wait, buddy.
- The movie is starting in 10 minutes.

159
00:10:23,868 --> 00:10:25,631
It's okay, we're cool.

160
00:10:25,736 --> 00:10:29,035
- We're only gonna miss the trailers.
- Yeah, but I wanna get some popcorn.

161
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,166
When we get in there,
get Chris some popcorn. Okay?

162
00:10:33,411 --> 00:10:34,145
What d'you wanna drink?

163
00:10:34,145 --> 00:10:35,680
- You want a Pepsi?
- Yeah, that's fine.

164
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,843
Get him a Pepsi
and I'll have an Icee. Mixed.

165
00:10:40,251 --> 00:10:42,276
Like when they mix the red one
and the blue one.

166
00:10:44,155 --> 00:10:45,486
And a pack of Twizzlers.

167
00:11:07,578 --> 00:11:09,341
<i>The comic books had it wrong.</i>

168
00:11:10,047 --> 00:11:15,110
<i>It didn't take a trauma or cosmic rays</i>
<i>or a power ring to make a superhero.</i>

169
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,256
<i>Just the perfect combination</i>
<i>of optimism and naivety.</i>

170
00:11:54,225 --> 00:11:56,921
You are fucking awesome.

171
00:11:59,497 --> 00:12:01,431
Come on then, bring it on!

172
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:31,785
- Daddy, I'm scared.
- Come on, Mindy. Honey.

173
00:12:31,896 --> 00:12:34,990
Be a big girl now.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

174
00:12:35,132 --> 00:12:38,033
- Is it gonna hurt bad?
- Oh, child.

175
00:12:38,236 --> 00:12:39,999
Only for a second, sugar.

176
00:12:40,204 --> 00:12:43,374
A handgun bullet travels at more than...

177
00:12:43,374 --> 00:12:45,910
- 700 miles an hour.
- 700 miles an hour.

178
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:50,514
So at close range, like this, the force is
gonna take you off yourfeet for sure...

179
00:12:50,514 --> 00:12:53,540
...but it's really no more painful
than a punch in the chest.

180
00:12:53,651 --> 00:12:55,551
I hate getting punched in the chest.

181
00:12:56,287 --> 00:12:58,016
You're gonna be fine, baby doll.

182
00:13:06,163 --> 00:13:08,723
How was that? Not so bad.

183
00:13:08,933 --> 00:13:12,164
Kinda fun, huh?
Now you know how it feels.

184
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:15,673
You won't be scared when some junkie
asshole pulls a Glock.

185
00:13:15,673 --> 00:13:18,643
- I wouldn't have been scared anyways.
- That's my girl.

186
00:13:18,643 --> 00:13:20,478
All right, up you get. Come on.

187
00:13:20,478 --> 00:13:23,080
Two more rounds and then home.

188
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,980
- Again?
- Uh-huh.

189
00:13:25,516 --> 00:13:28,349
Only if we can go
by the bowling alley on the way back.

190
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:33,013
- The bowling alley?
- Yeah. And ice-cream after.

191
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,089
Okay. Two more rounds.
No wincing...

192
00:13:39,297 --> 00:13:43,100
...no whining, and you got
yourself a deal, young lady.

193
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,870
Yeah!
I'm gonna get a hot fudge sundae.

194
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,861
Good call, baby doll.

195
00:13:51,175 --> 00:13:55,134
So, have you thought about
what you might want foryour birthday?

196
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,974
Can I get a puppy?

197
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:01,579
- You wanna get a dog?
- Yeah, a cuddly fluffy one.

198
00:14:01,652 --> 00:14:04,416
And a Bratz Moviestar Makeover Sasha.

199
00:14:09,493 --> 00:14:11,228
I'm just fucking with you, Daddy.

200
00:14:11,228 --> 00:14:14,595
Look, I'll have a Benchmade model-42
butterfly knife.

201
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:18,426
Oh, child.
You always knock me for a loop.

202
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:20,037
- You know what?
- What?

203
00:14:20,037 --> 00:14:22,139
- I'm gonna get you two.
- Two?

204
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:25,404
One Balisong.
Two Balisong. That's what you get.

205
00:14:44,095 --> 00:14:46,964
The glass of fashion
and the mould of form.

206
00:14:46,964 --> 00:14:50,901
The observed of all observers,
quite, quite down!

207
00:14:50,901 --> 00:14:53,631
And I, of ladies most deject
and wretched...

208
00:14:59,977 --> 00:15:01,178
<i>I'll be honest,</i>

209
00:15:01,178 --> 00:15:04,705
<i>there wasn't a whole lot of</i>
<i>crime-fighting in those first few weeks.</i>

210
00:15:05,282 --> 00:15:08,649
<i>But even so, my new vocation</i>
<i>kept me plenty busy.</i>

211
00:15:13,991 --> 00:15:14,959
Shit.

212
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,483
<i>I called it preparation.</i>

213
00:15:20,631 --> 00:15:24,328
<i>But if you called it fantasizing,</i>
<i>it would have been hard to argue.</i>

214
00:15:25,302 --> 00:15:29,136
<i>All I knew was</i>
<i>I'd never felt so good about myself.</i>

215
00:15:45,856 --> 00:15:46,845
Fuck!

216
00:15:48,225 --> 00:15:51,285
<i>Okay, maybe I was still in the</i>
<i>beta testing phase.</i>

217
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:53,160
<i>But it was a start.</i>

218
00:16:10,514 --> 00:16:12,846
What the fuck are you looking at?

219
00:16:13,117 --> 00:16:15,984
- Nothing.
- Get the fuck out of here!

220
00:16:20,624 --> 00:16:22,793
<i>Like every serial killer already knew,</i>

221
00:16:22,793 --> 00:16:25,694
<i>eventually fantasizing</i>
<i>just doesn't do it for you any more.</i>

222
00:16:26,831 --> 00:16:28,492
<i>It was time to engage.</i>

223
00:16:31,068 --> 00:16:32,000
Hurry up, man.

224
00:16:35,272 --> 00:16:36,933
What the fuck?

225
00:16:45,883 --> 00:16:47,646
The fuck you looking at?

226
00:16:48,452 --> 00:16:51,012
I said what the fuck are you looking at?

227
00:16:55,993 --> 00:16:58,496
Two cheap shit losers screwing with a car...

228
00:16:58,496 --> 00:17:01,659
...that someone probably worked their
ass off to pay for.

229
00:17:02,466 --> 00:17:05,560
- Say what?
- Leave it be, man.

230
00:17:06,403 --> 00:17:08,769
This motherfucker's obviously high.

231
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:14,402
I'm not high. Ljust think it sucks you
guys think you can do what you want.

232
00:17:15,412 --> 00:17:18,210
Just walk away from the car and
we can forget about this.

233
00:17:21,018 --> 00:17:22,986
You're crazy, man.

234
00:17:23,187 --> 00:17:24,176
Fuck this shit.

235
00:17:38,335 --> 00:17:39,859
- Shit.
- Let's get out of here.

236
00:18:22,413 --> 00:18:26,816
<i>I came round long enough to beg the</i>
<i>medic not to tell anybody about the costume.</i>

237
00:18:27,551 --> 00:18:29,018
<i>He promised he wouldn't.</i>

238
00:18:30,888 --> 00:18:33,880
<i>All I knew was my dad was</i>
<i>gonna kill me.</i>

239
00:18:48,772 --> 00:18:51,609
Why can't I have a gun?
I'm a security guard.

240
00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:54,078
You're a doorman now.
You don't get a gun no more.

241
00:18:54,078 --> 00:18:55,613
I look like a putz.

242
00:18:55,613 --> 00:18:59,674
You look sharp. All them buttons.
Do your job, open the fucking door.

243
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:03,545
Have a nice day.

244
00:19:31,949 --> 00:19:34,718
- Good morning, Frank.
- Hey, Joe, how you doing?

245
00:19:34,718 --> 00:19:35,753
Great.

246
00:19:35,753 --> 00:19:38,051
- Want some coffee?
- Maybe later.

247
00:19:38,355 --> 00:19:39,857
- Morning, Ange.
- Morning.

248
00:19:39,857 --> 00:19:41,484
- Chris.
- Morning, Joe.

249
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,660
Frank, we got a thing.

250
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,091
It's a big thing, Frank.

251
00:19:51,402 --> 00:19:52,426
Okay.

252
00:19:53,437 --> 00:19:56,429
- Sorry, hon.
- Do what you gotta do.

253
00:20:01,512 --> 00:20:04,014
- Chris, where do you think you're going?
- I gotta talk to dad.

254
00:20:04,014 --> 00:20:05,174
Christopher.

255
00:20:05,315 --> 00:20:06,612
Frank, honey.

256
00:20:09,253 --> 00:20:10,854
Where do you think you're going?

257
00:20:10,854 --> 00:20:14,892
I don't mind you talking business.
I was just gonna sit quietly.

258
00:20:14,892 --> 00:20:17,486
I should probably start learning
this stuff anyway.

259
00:20:17,594 --> 00:20:19,329
Hey, go finish your oatmeal.

260
00:20:19,329 --> 00:20:23,163
God-dammit, I'm gonna be
18 in 8 months, for Christ sakes.

261
00:20:26,336 --> 00:20:27,428
Take a seat.

262
00:20:30,741 --> 00:20:31,809
So what's the problem?

263
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:36,542
Our Russian says that Tre just
sold him another 5 K's at half price.

264
00:20:36,613 --> 00:20:40,344
- Which Tre? Tre Tre?
- Right. Dead Tre.

265
00:20:40,784 --> 00:20:43,053
So now I'm getting
fucked in the ass by a ghost?

266
00:20:43,053 --> 00:20:44,918
Or Tre was telling the truth.

267
00:20:45,055 --> 00:20:50,425
What, this is my choice? I gotta believe in
ghosts or superheroes?

268
00:20:50,494 --> 00:20:53,097
Not the part about the superhero, Frankie.

269
00:20:53,097 --> 00:20:56,089
Just that he might have really been
gaffled by somebody.

270
00:21:00,003 --> 00:21:03,632
I think we better invite our Russian
overfor a friendly chat.

271
00:21:05,709 --> 00:21:07,609
See what's really going on.

272
00:21:23,193 --> 00:21:26,563
Hey, early birdie.
You beat me to it.

273
00:21:26,563 --> 00:21:28,622
I wanted to get you breakfast
this morning.

274
00:21:28,966 --> 00:21:30,729
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

275
00:21:32,703 --> 00:21:34,034
Check this out.

276
00:21:42,613 --> 00:21:44,638
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.

277
00:21:44,748 --> 00:21:47,410
Oh my gosh! Dad.

278
00:21:50,988 --> 00:21:53,320
Wow. Watch, Dad.

279
00:21:54,057 --> 00:21:57,528
Okay, pop quiz. What's the proper
name for one of those?

280
00:21:57,528 --> 00:22:00,063
Easy: Balisong. It's Filipino.
Ask me another.

281
00:22:00,063 --> 00:22:01,198
Excellent, good.

282
00:22:01,198 --> 00:22:04,101
The AR15 was a lighter...

283
00:22:04,101 --> 00:22:07,404
...smaller calibre version of
what design?

284
00:22:07,404 --> 00:22:10,373
Eugene Stoner's AR10.
Now give me a hard one.

285
00:22:10,974 --> 00:22:12,532
The name of...

286
00:22:14,011 --> 00:22:17,414
...John Woo's first full-length feature?

287
00:22:17,414 --> 00:22:19,541
'Tie Han Rou Qing'.
'The Young Dragons'.

288
00:22:20,017 --> 00:22:21,211
Daddy, look.

289
00:22:21,718 --> 00:22:23,515
Hey, come on, you're not looking.

290
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:30,021
The point is some fucker
is killing our guys.

291
00:22:30,227 --> 00:22:31,762
And until we find out who that is,

292
00:22:31,762 --> 00:22:34,788
I don't wanna see any of you bitches
sitting around on your asses, all right?!

293
00:22:34,898 --> 00:22:35,887
What the fuck d'you...

294
00:22:36,934 --> 00:22:38,128
Hello.

295
00:22:38,669 --> 00:22:40,193
Hey, Joe, yeah.

296
00:22:40,537 --> 00:22:43,768
No, he's just training right now.
One second.

297
00:22:44,575 --> 00:22:46,440
Dad. Phone.

298
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:50,044
Dad, the phone's foryou.

299
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,875
- Who is it?
- It's Joe.

300
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,154
What's the problem?

301
00:22:57,154 --> 00:22:58,088
<i>Yeah, Frank...</i>

302
00:22:58,088 --> 00:22:59,923
Turns out we ain't
got the vice here no more.

303
00:22:59,923 --> 00:23:01,584
<i>- Really?</i>
- Uh-uh.

304
00:23:01,859 --> 00:23:05,929
But we do got a brand new industrial
microwave -they use it fortreating the lumber.

305
00:23:05,929 --> 00:23:07,328
Well, that is neat.

306
00:23:08,232 --> 00:23:10,000
I think you must be confusing me
with someone who

307
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,069
<i>gives a shit about the fucking lumber!</i>

308
00:23:12,069 --> 00:23:13,604
- Yeah, o-okay. All right, Frank.
<i>- Now quit bugging me and</i>

309
00:23:13,604 --> 00:23:15,973
- All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay? I...
<i>- get the fucking rest of the information.</i>

310
00:23:15,973 --> 00:23:17,065
All right, okay.

311
00:23:18,976 --> 00:23:20,238
Right, come on, go ahead.

312
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,846
Hey, look, the guys tell me
he's Tre Fernandez.

313
00:23:22,846 --> 00:23:24,181
What do I know, huh?

314
00:23:24,181 --> 00:23:26,083
- Shut up.
- Now you say Fernandez is dead.

315
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:27,951
- Okay, he lie.
- Get inside. Shut up.

316
00:23:27,951 --> 00:23:29,851
- He lie about...
- Fucking mamaluke...

317
00:23:32,623 --> 00:23:34,648
This work like a regular microwave?

318
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:38,750
Fuck do I know? We're not making a
Hungry Man dinner. Just turn it on.

319
00:23:41,865 --> 00:23:43,100
Here we go.

320
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,228
Okay, I wanna know who
sold you our coke.

321
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:49,396
And don't tell me somebody who's
dead this time.

322
00:23:53,043 --> 00:23:55,568
Can he hearyou?
I don't think he can hearyou.

323
00:23:57,648 --> 00:24:00,845
I said who really sold you our coke?

324
00:24:04,922 --> 00:24:07,516
Who sold...

325
00:24:07,724 --> 00:24:11,182
...you... our... coke?

326
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:15,760
Oh, shit! Shit!

327
00:24:21,171 --> 00:24:22,661
This is awesome!

328
00:24:22,773 --> 00:24:24,968
I look like fricking Wolverine.

329
00:24:25,542 --> 00:24:28,211
You still have that metal detector
at your school?

330
00:24:28,211 --> 00:24:30,679
Yeah. It's gonna have a meltdown.

331
00:24:33,116 --> 00:24:35,584
Dave, I need to ask you something.

332
00:24:37,421 --> 00:24:38,683
Okay.

333
00:24:39,056 --> 00:24:41,992
The police report.
They found you naked.

334
00:24:41,992 --> 00:24:44,620
You said you didn't remember why.

335
00:24:45,162 --> 00:24:46,823
The muggers, they didn't...

336
00:24:48,365 --> 00:24:49,593
What?

337
00:24:51,902 --> 00:24:56,532
No. Jesus.
No, I... I wasn't even...

338
00:24:57,708 --> 00:25:00,643
In the ambulance they threw my clothes
away because of the blood.

339
00:25:01,979 --> 00:25:03,446
Okay, okay.

340
00:25:09,219 --> 00:25:11,989
<i>Seemed like no time at all</i>
<i>before I was back on my feet.</i>

341
00:25:11,989 --> 00:25:13,980
- Dave's what?
- Keep it down.

342
00:25:15,425 --> 00:25:20,192
<i>Apart from some messed-up nerve endings,</i>
<i>the doctors fixed me up pretty good.</i>

343
00:25:20,497 --> 00:25:22,165
- Did you feel that?
- No.

344
00:25:22,165 --> 00:25:25,225
You're like fucking Jason Bourne
or something, man. That owns.

345
00:25:25,469 --> 00:25:27,738
- How about that?
- No, Marty.

346
00:25:27,738 --> 00:25:29,399
Give it a fucking rest.

347
00:25:29,573 --> 00:25:30,974
I've only been back like half a day and

348
00:25:30,974 --> 00:25:33,010
you're already making me
kinda miss the hospital.

349
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:35,945
He's right. I'm sorry.
I'm acting totally childish.

350
00:25:36,046 --> 00:25:37,843
- Stop with the fork.
- Watch this.

351
00:25:49,459 --> 00:25:50,551
Hey.

352
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:54,427
Dave, hey.

353
00:25:55,932 --> 00:25:57,399
Oh, hey.

354
00:25:58,435 --> 00:26:00,630
How are you? You look better.

355
00:26:01,371 --> 00:26:04,238
I'm good. Yeah, much better.

356
00:26:04,374 --> 00:26:06,569
You're into comic books, aren't you?

357
00:26:07,244 --> 00:26:09,679
Well, me and Erika sometimes
hang out after school

358
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,147
at this really great store -Atomic Comics.

359
00:26:12,215 --> 00:26:14,740
They make the best white chocolate
milk-a-latte.

360
00:26:15,152 --> 00:26:16,414
Yeah?

361
00:26:18,188 --> 00:26:23,751
I could buy you one sometime
if you need someone to talk to.

362
00:26:26,196 --> 00:26:28,664
- Sure. Thank you.
- Okay.

363
00:26:28,765 --> 00:26:30,528
Sweet. Well, I'll see you later.

364
00:26:34,504 --> 00:26:35,839
- Did you see that?
- Yeah?

365
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:38,175
Katie Deauxma
just offered to buy me coffee.

366
00:26:38,175 --> 00:26:41,078
Yeah. You know, I really don't think
that's what it looks like.

367
00:26:41,078 --> 00:26:43,713
- What are you talking about?
- The point is...

368
00:26:43,713 --> 00:26:46,181
...Katie's all about the lame ducks.

369
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:48,118
What's this got to do with me?

370
00:26:48,118 --> 00:26:50,518
I've been trying to figure out
how to tell you this.

371
00:26:51,555 --> 00:26:53,890
- There's a rumour going around...
- Right.

372
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:55,325
...that you...
- What?

373
00:26:55,325 --> 00:26:57,156
...are gay.
- Gay?!

374
00:26:57,461 --> 00:27:00,430
- What kind of rumour's that?
- Well, getting mugged and...

375
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:02,866
- You guys have been mugged.
- I know, but...

376
00:27:02,866 --> 00:27:05,535
...we didn't get beat up and
have all our clothes taken off.

377
00:27:05,535 --> 00:27:08,561
It's not even true.
The medic threw my clothes away.

378
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,675
Don't worry about it.
Rumours don't mean shit.

379
00:27:11,675 --> 00:27:12,542
We know the truth.

380
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:13,143
Right?

381
00:27:13,143 --> 00:27:13,877
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

382
00:27:13,877 --> 00:27:16,246
Who knows, this might even get you laid.

383
00:27:16,246 --> 00:27:19,409
No, not if she thinks he's gay, Todd.
You fucking retard.

384
00:27:19,983 --> 00:27:22,543
- That's really fucking helping me!
- I'm just being honest.

385

<i>I was getting back to my old self.</i>

390
00:27:40,504 --> 00:27:41,596
No, I'm not!

391

<i>- It is what it is.</i>
- How about that, huh?

392
00:27:46,943 --> 00:27:49,779
Oh, yeah.
Didn't see that, did you?

393
00:27:49,779 --> 00:27:51,715
Think it's best that you just walk away.

394
00:27:51,715 --> 00:27:53,183
Well maybe you shouldn't do that.

395
00:27:53,183 --> 00:27:54,151
What? Huh?

396
00:27:54,151 --> 00:27:55,085

<i>Kick-Ass, right?</i>

456
00:33:27,484 --> 00:33:28,917
<i>Yeah!</i>

457
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:34,379
<i>I like Kick-Ass.</i>
<i>His costume is crappy.</i>

458
00:33:34,591 --> 00:33:36,183
<i>He looks like a transvestite...</i>

459
00:33:36,326 --> 00:33:38,658
You know what?
Everyone likes Kick-Ass.

460
00:33:39,462 --> 00:33:41,760
Did you see the clip?
He was actually pretty good.

461
00:33:41,898 --> 00:33:44,332
Good at getting his ass kicked.

462
00:33:44,567 --> 00:33:47,559
He should call himself
Ass-Kick instead.

463
00:33:48,071 --> 00:33:49,766
That doesn't even make sense.

464
00:33:52,509 --> 00:33:54,477
That guy's gonna end up dead,
that's what I think.

465
00:33:54,477 --> 00:33:56,779
Are you serious? The guy owns.

466
00:33:56,779 --> 00:33:59,373
I'd e-mail his site
if I had a problem worth fixing.

467
00:33:59,482 --> 00:34:03,418
I got 100 guys can fix a problem,
you'd hire some putz in pantyhose?

468
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:07,712
I wouldn't wanna get in the way of
your 'business' where I'm not wanted.

469
00:34:08,024 --> 00:34:12,051
<i>I know you have mistaken me for Kick-Ass,</i>
<i>but I am not Kick-Ass.</i>

470
00:34:30,914 --> 00:34:32,905
So you don't actually read comics?

471
00:34:33,016 --> 00:34:34,117
Ljust started.

472
00:34:34,117 --> 00:34:38,349
I got recommended some like Scott Pilgrim
and Shojo Beat, that kinda thing.

473
00:34:38,454 --> 00:34:40,979
I'm not really into the whole
superhero thing, though.

474
00:34:42,492 --> 00:34:46,129
So I guess you're not gonna line up
forthat new Kick-Ass comic, then?

475
00:34:46,129 --> 00:34:50,400
I guess not. But I was seriously
thinking of mailing his site.

476
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,236
I mean, I could really use some help
from a guy like that right now.

477
00:34:53,236 --> 00:34:56,000
Help? Really? What with?

478
00:34:56,573 --> 00:34:59,041
You know I volunteer
at the Needle Exchange?

479
00:34:59,475 --> 00:35:00,843
No, I didn't.

480
00:35:00,843 --> 00:35:04,714
Well, there's this one guy, Rasul.
I felt so sorry for him and...

481
00:35:04,714 --> 00:35:08,081
...the more I found out about his
upbringing and stuff, ljust...

482
00:35:10,687 --> 00:35:15,249
Wow, that's weird. I'm usually
the one playing therapist.

483
00:35:17,093 --> 00:35:19,391
Can I make a confession?

484
00:35:19,896 --> 00:35:24,128
Ever since I was little I've always
wanted a friend...

485
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,265
...like you.

486
00:35:26,903 --> 00:35:30,430
Is it okay to say that?
That's not homophobic, is it?

487
00:35:31,874 --> 00:35:34,434
I mean, I don't think you're
all the same or anything.

488
00:35:43,786 --> 00:35:46,277
Of course not, no.

489
00:35:46,589 --> 00:35:47,783
Thank you.

490
00:35:52,328 --> 00:35:56,492

497
00:36:16,152 --> 00:36:19,747

499
00:36:41,711 --> 00:36:44,703
Who the fuck are you supposed to be?
The Green Condom?

500
00:36:45,948 --> 00:36:48,508
You know it ain't Hallowe'en for
anotherfew months, kid?

501
00:36:48,985 --> 00:36:50,577
I'm here to see Rasul.

502
00:36:52,321 --> 00:36:53,720
Who the fuck are you?

503
00:36:54,223 --> 00:36:57,021
I'm Ki... I'm a friend of Katie's.

504
00:37:02,965 --> 00:37:04,990
Kids nowadays in theirtights.

505
00:37:19,515 --> 00:37:22,541
So, which one of you guys is Rasul?

506
00:37:29,292 --> 00:37:33,422
I'm Rasul. Can't you tell
by my big titties?

507
00:37:36,699 --> 00:37:38,633
What is this?
Trick ortreat or something?

508
00:37:40,503 --> 00:37:42,528
Fuck. Now I'm dead.

509
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:47,535
I've a message for Rasul
about Katie Deauxma.

510
00:37:50,546 --> 00:37:51,604
Katie?

511
00:37:51,748 --> 00:37:53,045
Oh, you're Rasul?

512
00:37:53,783 --> 00:37:57,617
Okay. You gotta stay away
from Katie now. It's over.

513
00:37:57,887 --> 00:38:01,414
So if you just leave her alone
everything will be fine.

514
00:38:01,958 --> 00:38:02,947
What?

515
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,826
Yo, kid. Who the hell are you?

516
00:38:07,363 --> 00:38:08,557
And what is this?

517
00:38:09,365 --> 00:38:11,560
I'm Kick-Ass. Look me up.

518
00:38:12,168 --> 00:38:16,571
And this is me giving you a message.
Leave Katie alone.

519
00:38:29,152 --> 00:38:30,346
Or what?

520
00:38:35,091 --> 00:38:37,651
Or... I'll come back...

521
00:38:38,895 --> 00:38:40,920
...and break yourfucking legs.

522
00:38:45,735 --> 00:38:47,430
I'm right here now, baby.

523
00:38:50,106 --> 00:38:51,073
Fuck!

524
00:38:58,047 --> 00:38:59,036
Hold him.

525
00:39:06,255 --> 00:39:07,916
You are so fucking dead, man.

526
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:27,141
Okay, you cunts.
Let's see what you can do now.

527
00:39:27,577 --> 00:39:29,841
Eeny, meeny...

528
00:39:30,046 --> 00:39:32,071
...miny, mo.

529
00:39:52,969 --> 00:39:54,095
What the fuck?!

530
00:40:21,597 --> 00:40:23,462
Hey, I got one of those.

531
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,139
Come on.

532
00:40:43,219 --> 00:40:44,618
So you wanna play.

533
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:02,696
What the fuck?

534
00:41:05,908 --> 00:41:09,469
Oh, dude, that is one gay-looking taser.

535
00:41:12,048 --> 00:41:13,845
Relax, we're on the same team.

536
00:41:15,551 --> 00:41:16,449
Hey, get up.

537
00:41:23,092 --> 00:41:26,892
Now, Hit Girl,
we always keep our backs where?

538
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:31,930
To the wall, Daddy, I know.
It won't happen again.

539
00:41:32,568 --> 00:41:34,763
- Nice shot, by the way.
- Thank you.

540
00:41:52,788 --> 00:41:53,777
Let's go.

541
00:41:55,458 --> 00:41:58,791
Hey, asshole,
you can't use the front door now.

542
00:42:13,442 --> 00:42:14,568
Wait, wait, wait.

543
00:42:15,978 --> 00:42:16,910
What?

544
00:42:18,047 --> 00:42:19,446
Who are you?

545
00:42:19,548 --> 00:42:20,537
Me?

546
00:42:21,751 --> 00:42:23,082
I'm Hit Girl.

547
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,411
And that's: Big Daddy.

548
00:42:33,596 --> 00:42:34,528
Come on.

549
00:42:39,869 --> 00:42:41,063
Come on!

550
00:43:17,706 --> 00:43:19,503
<i>Hit Girl and Big Daddy.</i>

551
00:43:19,708 --> 00:43:21,266
<i>They were the real deal.</i>

552
00:43:23,746 --> 00:43:24,804
<i>Me?</i>

553
00:43:25,548 --> 00:43:28,381
<i>I was just a stupid dick in a wetsuit.</i>

554
00:43:43,966 --> 00:43:46,264
What is this?
What am I looking at here?

555
00:43:46,435 --> 00:43:49,772
It was Sal's phone.
They found it in his hand.

556
00:43:49,772 --> 00:43:52,341
He must have
taken that right before he died.

557
00:43:52,341 --> 00:43:56,072
I know this sounds fucked-up, Frankie,
but that guy in the picture...

558
00:43:56,979 --> 00:44:00,142
...I think it's that
superhero nut job from the TV.

559
00:44:00,349 --> 00:44:01,316
Who?

560
00:44:02,351 --> 00:44:03,784
Kick-Ass?

561
00:44:04,253 --> 00:44:05,618
One guy?

562
00:44:06,555 --> 00:44:09,547
Hold on, you're telling me one guy
killed 8 of my men tonight?

563
00:44:14,163 --> 00:44:18,293
8 at Sal's place. 4 at that kid Rasul's.

564
00:44:19,635 --> 00:44:21,804
We have no merchandise
on the street at all?

565
00:44:21,804 --> 00:44:22,896
Right.

566
00:44:25,674 --> 00:44:27,904
- One guy?
- I think.

567
00:44:28,677 --> 00:44:32,204
If you're right, we'll look like
the biggest pussies in New York.

568
00:44:32,815 --> 00:44:34,305
What do you want me to do?

569
00:44:35,417 --> 00:44:40,320
I want Kick-Ass's fucking head
on a stick, and I want it now.

570
00:44:49,832 --> 00:44:51,959
I didn't say anything to anyone, I swear.

571
00:44:52,101 --> 00:44:56,197
Good move, Ass... Kick.
Let's keep it that way.

572
00:44:57,406 --> 00:44:58,964
You know what this is?

573
00:44:59,909 --> 00:45:03,504
It's all the cartridge crap that comes out
of your gay little taser when you fire it.

574
00:45:03,712 --> 00:45:07,011
You do know the police could have traced
this right back to you if they'd found it?

575
00:45:07,216 --> 00:45:10,310
But lucky foryou...
I picked it up.

576
00:45:11,487 --> 00:45:12,579
Thank you.

577
00:45:13,622 --> 00:45:17,660
Let's call it insurance.
Makes it easierfor us to take your word.

578
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:21,061
See, we like you,
but we don't trust you.

579
00:45:22,164 --> 00:45:25,000
Don't take it personal.
We don't trust anybody.

580
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,503
I re-routed your IP address.

581
00:45:27,503 --> 00:45:31,166
Finding you was way too easy.

582
00:45:32,007 --> 00:45:35,878
Oh, shit. Shit, I hadn't thought.
My God.

583
00:45:35,878 --> 00:45:38,244
I, I owe you.

584
00:45:38,547 --> 00:45:41,380
I'm thinking of shutting
my site down anyway.

585
00:45:41,884 --> 00:45:46,116
Quitting. I mean, this is...
it's fucking insane.

586
00:45:46,522 --> 00:45:48,591
I'm in way over my head.

587
00:45:48,591 --> 00:45:50,893
It's a shame. You have potential.

588
00:45:50,893 --> 00:45:54,329
Your call. But you know we're around
if you need us.

589
00:45:55,331 --> 00:45:57,266
How do I get a hold of you?

590
00:45:57,266 --> 00:45:59,068
You just contact the Mayor's office.

591
00:45:59,068 --> 00:46:01,434
He has a special signal
he shines in the sky.

592
00:46:01,604 --> 00:46:03,469
In the shape of a giant cock.

593
00:46:04,573 --> 00:46:07,810
You need us, put on your website
you're on vacation. We'll find you.

594
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:09,334
Hit Girl, back to headquarters.

595
00:46:11,914 --> 00:46:13,040
Sweet dreams.

596
00:46:19,288 --> 00:46:21,190
I need you to get rid of Kick-Ass.

597
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:23,750
<i>- Yo. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's up?</i>
- What's up?

598
00:46:24,193 --> 00:46:27,185
Kick-Ass is killing my men,
Gigante, that's what's up.

599
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:29,693
<i>My condolences, Frank.</i>

600
00:46:29,932 --> 00:46:33,369
But I'm afraid
I can't help you on this one.

601
00:46:33,369 --> 00:46:37,373
- Little bit outside my jurisdiction.
<i>- Outside your jurisdiction?</i>

602
00:46:37,373 --> 00:46:39,241
You're a fucking cop and
he's breaking the law.

603
00:46:39,241 --> 00:46:42,578
That's so inside it's ball-deep
in your jurisdiction's ass.

604
00:46:42,578 --> 00:46:43,670
<i>Listen to me.</i>

605
00:46:43,912 --> 00:46:47,211
The cops pay me to nail the bad guys.
You pay me not to.

606
00:46:47,316 --> 00:46:51,616
<i>- Everything else is in the grey area.</i>
- Fuck you very much. Just do it. Okay.

607
00:46:53,355 --> 00:46:55,220
Un-fucking-believable.

608
00:46:56,392 --> 00:46:58,656
Where's Cody? He's late.

609
00:46:59,161 --> 00:47:03,461
Thank you, Cody.
We appreciate your co-operation.

610
00:47:03,565 --> 00:47:05,234
Let me out now?

611
00:47:05,234 --> 00:47:07,361
I gave you all them names
and addresses.

612
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:09,838
Hey, I won't say nothing to nobody.

613
00:47:09,838 --> 00:47:12,408
You and your crazy midget friend can
go bash whoeveryou want.

614
00:47:12,408 --> 00:47:13,108
Hey, come on.

615
00:47:13,108 --> 00:47:16,812
Hey, I know some very bad people up town.
Really nasty individuals.

616
00:47:16,812 --> 00:47:18,647
Let me go. Hey, come on.

617
00:47:18,647 --> 00:47:21,309
Hey, hey, don't do this.
You don't need to do this. Come on.

618
00:47:22,351 --> 00:47:23,716
Please. Hey.

619
00:47:25,754 --> 00:47:26,880
Come on, no, no...

620
00:47:29,258 --> 00:47:31,123
No, no, no! Come on, please!

621
00:47:32,561 --> 00:47:34,529
Hey, you're crazy. Please!

622
00:47:46,842 --> 00:47:48,571
What a douche.

623
00:48:02,057 --> 00:48:04,457
You have done self tan before, right?

624
00:48:05,094 --> 00:48:07,654
Yeah, like, I do it all the time.

625
00:48:08,364 --> 00:48:11,595
<i>Murder, superheroes breaking</i>
<i>into my bedroom.</i>

626
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:15,431
<i>My life had turned into some fucked-up</i>
<i>dream I couldn't wake up from.</i>

627
00:48:16,672 --> 00:48:19,436
<i>Even the good parts</i>
<i>were totally surreal.</i>

628
00:48:19,908 --> 00:48:22,511
Oh, hey, I read those
old Ditko Spidermans you gave me.

629
00:48:22,511 --> 00:48:23,944
They're actually pretty good.

630
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:26,613
Yeah, they are.

631
00:48:28,117 --> 00:48:30,881
And it's been a whole week
since I've heard from Rasul.

632
00:48:34,089 --> 00:48:35,488
That's great.

633
00:49:30,779 --> 00:49:35,944
<i>Once upon a time there were 2 supercops</i>
<i>called Daddy and Marcus...</i>

634
00:49:36,084 --> 00:49:38,644
<i>... who were very good</i>
<i>at getting bad guys.</i>

635
00:49:39,988 --> 00:49:42,724
<i>Frank D'Amico was the</i>
<i>baddest guy of them all...</i>

636
00:49:42,724 --> 00:49:45,921
<i>... and he came up with</i>
<i>a plan to get rid of Daddy.</i>

637
00:49:49,798 --> 00:49:55,100
<i>Being framed as a drug dealer was the</i>
<i>worst thing that could have happened to Daddy.</i>

638
00:49:57,239 --> 00:50:00,606
<i>Prison was not his natural habitat.</i>

639
00:50:00,976 --> 00:50:02,807
<i>He was very upset.</i>

640
00:50:06,381 --> 00:50:10,283
<i>With Daddy in prison,</i>
<i>his pregnant wife was all alone...</i>

641
00:50:11,587 --> 00:50:13,452
<i>... and could not cope.</i>

642
00:50:16,024 --> 00:50:20,051
<i>But all clouds have a silver lining</i>
<i>and out of her death...</i>

643
00:50:23,999 --> 00:50:25,990
<i>... Mindy was born.</i>

644
00:50:26,201 --> 00:50:28,829
<i>Marcus became the child's guardian...</i>

645
00:50:29,071 --> 00:50:32,040
<i>... and Daddy started a plan</i>
<i>of his very own.</i>

646
00:50:34,142 --> 00:50:38,169
<i>5 years later he left prison,</i>
<i>and he was ready.</i>

647
00:50:42,184 --> 00:50:45,620
<i>Now it was time for</i>
<i>Mindy to get ready, too.</i>

648
00:50:53,362 --> 00:50:55,262
How did you find me, Marcus?

649
00:50:56,031 --> 00:50:58,465
One of us is still a cop, remember?

650
00:51:07,409 --> 00:51:09,177
Is this how you brainwashed Mindy?

651
00:51:09,177 --> 00:51:11,947
You say brainwashed,
I say made it into a game.

652
00:51:11,947 --> 00:51:13,744
You call this playing, Damon?

653
00:51:13,882 --> 00:51:17,409
Vigilante justice. Mass murder.
Come on, partner.

654
00:51:19,388 --> 00:51:20,912
So where is she?

655
00:51:21,356 --> 00:51:23,347
- She's safe.
- Can I see her?

656
00:51:24,993 --> 00:51:26,426
I miss her.

657
00:51:28,063 --> 00:51:30,031
I miss you both.

658
00:51:30,465 --> 00:51:34,663
I appreciate your concern,
but you need to go now.

659
00:51:40,175 --> 00:51:43,912
I should warn you, that asshole
Gigante is looking for Kick-Ass.

660
00:51:43,912 --> 00:51:45,777
He got something to do
with you, Damon?

661
00:51:45,881 --> 00:51:49,451
You started some kind of
fucked-up superhero club?

662
00:51:49,451 --> 00:51:52,852
- Never heard of him.
- Okay. Heads up, all right?

663
00:51:53,055 --> 00:51:54,923
You keep carrying on like you
been carrying on,

664
00:51:54,923 --> 00:51:57,687
it's only a matter of time
before Gigante is looking foryou.

665
00:51:58,093 --> 00:52:01,961
He's been on D'Amico's payroll ever
since you passed up the opportunity.

666
00:52:02,631 --> 00:52:04,531
You know I'm not gonna stop.

667
00:52:05,901 --> 00:52:09,769
Not until D'Amico and
his whole damn operation...

668
00:52:09,871 --> 00:52:13,864
...are burnt to ashes and buried.

669
00:52:15,143 --> 00:52:17,008
It ain't gonna bring her back, Damon.

670
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,771
This is not the life for Mindy.

671
00:52:23,485 --> 00:52:25,476
You owe that kid a childhood.

672
00:52:26,855 --> 00:52:28,914
I'll tell you who owes her a childhood.

673
00:52:29,358 --> 00:52:31,383
Frank D'Amico!

674
00:52:50,212 --> 00:52:51,873
Holy shit.

675
00:52:54,349 --> 00:52:56,943
I don't fucking believe it.

676
00:53:00,022 --> 00:53:01,649
Follow him, round the corner.

677
00:53:02,691 --> 00:53:03,953
Not too fast.

678
00:53:07,362 --> 00:53:09,125
What's with the high-fives?

679
00:53:09,564 --> 00:53:11,691
I'll give you a motherfucking high-five.

680
00:53:12,868 --> 00:53:15,632
High-fiving bullshit.
Keep going, keep going.

681
00:53:16,972 --> 00:53:18,337
Not too close.

682
00:53:23,311 --> 00:53:24,903
He's going in the alley.

683
00:53:25,414 --> 00:53:27,405
He's going in the alley.

684
00:53:27,816 --> 00:53:31,377
Okay, when I tell you,
stop the car. Ready?

685
00:53:35,424 --> 00:53:37,790
Hey, Kick-Ass.

686
00:53:38,026 --> 00:53:39,152
How you doing?

687
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:44,988
Kill my men, huh?
Take my fucking coke!

688
00:53:45,167 --> 00:53:47,235
Whoa, whoa, whoa, boss.
What are you doing?

689
00:53:47,235 --> 00:53:48,303
Boss, come on, we gotta go, baby.

690
00:53:48,303 --> 00:53:49,235
- Fucking scumbag!
- Come on, let's go.

691
00:53:49,538 --> 00:53:51,206
Boss, come on, he's had enough.

692
00:53:51,206 --> 00:53:53,003
Come on, Frank, he's had enough.
Come on.

693
00:53:54,209 --> 00:53:56,734
What the fuck are you looking at? Huh?

694
00:54:09,458 --> 00:54:11,892
Come on, come on. Come on, let's go.
We gotta go.

695
00:54:12,828 --> 00:54:14,629
Fuck. Shit. Damn.

696
00:54:14,629 --> 00:54:15,789
Come on, come on, get in.

697
00:54:23,135 --> 00:54:26,468
<i>He was so young.
No one should have to die that way.</i>

698
00:54:26,572 --> 00:54:29,803
I mean, I just can't believe he's dead,
that's all.

699
00:54:31,577 --> 00:54:34,205
I know. But, Katie,

700
00:54:34,881 --> 00:54:38,408
guys like Rasul, they
get mixed up in stuff...

701
00:54:38,885 --> 00:54:42,218
No, I know, I know.
But what if it was my fault?

702
00:54:42,322 --> 00:54:43,346
What if Kick-Ass did it?

703
00:54:43,456 --> 00:54:45,390
I mean, I feel like
I should call the cops or something.

704
00:54:45,492 --> 00:54:47,255
What? You're talking crazy.

705
00:54:47,827 --> 00:54:50,455
There's no way. He probably
didn't even read your e-mail yet.

706
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:52,821
- Yeah.
- You've got nothing to worry about.

707
00:54:54,734 --> 00:54:56,429
I'm so glad you're here.

708
00:54:57,070 --> 00:54:58,196
I was such a mess.

709
00:54:58,938 --> 00:55:00,303
That's okay.

710
00:55:00,406 --> 00:55:03,637
- No problem.
- You're the best.

711
00:55:05,678 --> 00:55:10,081
I hope it's okay to say this, but...
It so sucks that you're gay.

712
00:55:14,053 --> 00:55:16,248
I don't fucking believe this.

713
00:55:18,591 --> 00:55:22,527
What kind of
children's enter-fucking-tainer is that?

714
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:28,995
What kind of kid has a... A Spider-Man
party, sure, but a fucking Kick-Ass party?

715
00:55:29,102 --> 00:55:31,798
What, are they selling paper plates
and napkins down at the store now?

716
00:55:31,905 --> 00:55:34,271
Frank, you're scaring me. You're losing it.

717
00:55:34,674 --> 00:55:37,609
Since when did you start getting
your hands dirty again? And in public!

718
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:40,076
Since when I ask you fucks
to deliver me Kick-Ass,

719
00:55:40,179 --> 00:55:43,512
- and you don't deliver, that's when.
- Give me a break. It's been a week.

720
00:55:43,616 --> 00:55:46,949
We e-mailed him. We got half the crew out
doing petty crimes as bait.

721
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,710
We're busting our asses here.

722
00:55:49,856 --> 00:55:51,915
What the hell are you doing?

723
00:55:52,025 --> 00:55:53,754
You're back on the powder now, as well?

724
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:57,819
"Mommy, I want a Kick-Ass party."
Dumb little fucks.

725
00:55:58,998 --> 00:56:01,694
- I know a way you can get him.
- Shit.

726
00:56:01,801 --> 00:56:03,359
Chris, how long you been there?

727
00:56:03,469 --> 00:56:04,834
What the hell are you doing?
Get the hell out.

728
00:56:04,938 --> 00:56:06,235
Do you want to hear it or not?

729
00:56:07,073 --> 00:56:09,541
- Hear what?
- Okay, look,

730
00:56:09,642 --> 00:56:12,611
you're a superhero and you're lonely,
but you can't trust anyone

731
00:56:12,712 --> 00:56:14,339
'cause either
they'll expose your secret identity...

732
00:56:14,447 --> 00:56:16,677
Comic books this kid reads
all fucking day long.

733
00:56:16,783 --> 00:56:20,617
The point is there's only one way
a superhero can trust a stranger.

734
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,019
And I can be that stranger.
You just gotta give me a chance.

735
00:56:24,123 --> 00:56:26,387
I know I can do it. I
just need a few things.

736
00:56:28,294 --> 00:56:29,283
Like what?

737
00:56:31,331 --> 00:56:33,265
I need these things.

738
00:56:37,403 --> 00:56:39,200
What, are you fucking kidding me?
What the hell is this?

739
00:56:39,305 --> 00:56:41,136
It's everything I need.

740
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,504
And you might have to screw
someone over, like Louie, or something.

741
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:46,602
- Louie? Hey, Chris.
- Or somebody. It doesn't have to be Louie.

742
00:56:47,513 --> 00:56:48,878
- Tony!
- Tony.

743
00:56:49,716 --> 00:56:51,206
- Tony?
- I hate Tony.

744
00:56:51,317 --> 00:56:52,875
Yeah, fuck Tony. He's a scumbag.

745
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:56,452
I swear, Dad, if you let me do this,
it's gonna work.

746
00:57:01,227 --> 00:57:02,285
Tony.

747
00:57:02,729 --> 00:57:05,960
<i>Tony Romita, one of America's
most-wanted crime kingpins,</i>

748
00:57:06,065 --> 00:57:07,828
<i>was arrested in Queens today</i>

749
00:57:07,934 --> 00:57:10,801
<i>after a 911 call from someone
claiming to be a superhero...</i>

750
00:57:10,903 --> 00:57:13,371
So, how are things going with Katie?

751
00:57:14,874 --> 00:57:15,863
Just peachy.

752
00:57:16,442 --> 00:57:18,000
We had a sleepover
and spent the whole night

753
00:57:18,111 --> 00:57:21,410
<i>watching the entire Ugly Betty box set
and did pedicures.</i>

754
00:57:22,015 --> 00:57:24,882
I'm telling you, the longer you wait,
the worse it's gonna get.

755
00:57:25,284 --> 00:57:28,947
I know. I was gonna tell her.
It's just, she seems so happy.

756
00:57:29,055 --> 00:57:31,250
- I don't know when's the right time.
- Now's your chance.

757
00:57:32,725 --> 00:57:35,023
- She didn't see that, did she?
- Hey, guys.

758
00:57:35,828 --> 00:57:37,523
- Hi!
- Hi, sweetie.

759
00:57:38,297 --> 00:57:40,663
Did you watch the TV?
The new superhero guy?

760
00:57:40,767 --> 00:57:42,598
- How cool is that?
- What?

761
00:57:42,802 --> 00:57:45,270
- Hey, look.
- Could you turn it up, please?

762
00:57:45,371 --> 00:57:46,770
<i>- Check this out.
- ...dressed as Kick-Ass.</i>

763
00:57:46,873 --> 00:57:51,742
<i>But it seems that far from being put off,
this individual, who calls himself Red Mist,</i>

764
00:57:51,844 --> 00:57:53,971
<i>has decided to take
crime-fighting to a new level,</i>

765
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:57,277
<i>as his actions last night proved.
Red Mist, how do you see it?</i>

766
00:57:57,383 --> 00:57:59,874
<i>Well, I guess folks have just
had enough of living in fear, you know,</i>

767
00:57:59,986 --> 00:58:02,955
<i>and Kick-Ass really proved that
one individual can make a difference.</i>

768
00:58:03,056 --> 00:58:06,890
<i>So if anyone out there needs help,
I'll be fighting crime 25/8.</i>

769
00:58:06,993 --> 00:58:09,860
<i>And I'm just one click away. Redmist. org.</i>

770
00:58:11,464 --> 00:58:15,059
Can we turn that off now?
What's so special about that guy?

771
00:58:15,168 --> 00:58:17,864
He caught, like, a drug dealer,
some most-wanted guy.

772
00:58:18,237 --> 00:58:19,932
You saw him bringing out
like a ton of stuff.

773
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:21,529
That's pretty cool.

774
00:58:21,941 --> 00:58:24,273
He's got a way better costume
than Kick-Ass, too.

775
00:58:24,377 --> 00:58:25,810
- He's got a cape.
- Yeah.

776
00:58:25,912 --> 00:58:28,142
- Capes rock.
- Yeah, I'm kind of feeling the cape.

777
00:58:28,247 --> 00:58:29,908
He looks good.

778
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:33,210
What, better than Kick-Ass?

779
00:58:33,319 --> 00:58:36,186
I mean, they're both kind of hot.
I just think Red Mist has a better body.

780
00:58:36,689 --> 00:58:38,213
Don't you think, Dave?

781
00:58:39,759 --> 00:58:41,386
Yeah, Dave, what do you think?

782
00:58:42,161 --> 00:58:44,789
Is he the kind of guy you'd go for,
with all that leather?

783
00:58:46,099 --> 00:58:49,262
No, Marty. No, he's not really my type.

784
00:59:43,489 --> 00:59:44,717
Kick-Ass!

785
00:59:45,858 --> 00:59:46,847
Red Mist.

786
00:59:48,427 --> 00:59:50,418
Shit! Fuck me, that kind of hurt.

787
00:59:51,731 --> 00:59:54,291
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, no, I'm cool.

788
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:57,594
I can't believe you're here, man.
Like, you're my hero.

789
00:59:58,304 --> 01:00:01,000
You inspired me. No Kick-Ass, no Red Mist.

790
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,037
- Seriously.
- Wow.

791
01:00:03,643 --> 01:00:07,135
- Hey, really?
- Straight up. And listen, if you...

792
01:00:07,246 --> 01:00:10,044
I don't know, if you wanted me
to be your sidekick or something...

793
01:00:10,983 --> 01:00:12,211
You wanna be my sidekick?

794
01:00:12,552 --> 01:00:15,919
Yeah, man!
You and me together, we would own!

795
01:00:16,589 --> 01:00:18,420
You wanna go fight some crime?

796
01:00:18,891 --> 01:00:20,290
What you mean, like, right now?

797
01:00:20,893 --> 01:00:24,021
Yeah, man, come on.
I got something I wanna show you.

798
01:00:24,664 --> 01:00:26,063
I mean, like, to be honest with you,

799
01:00:26,165 --> 01:00:28,929
I only ever fight crime
between like 9:00 and 2:00, weekdays.

800
01:00:29,035 --> 01:00:31,868
So I'm gonna need to get back pretty soon.

801
01:00:35,474 --> 01:00:36,805
Sweet!

802
01:00:39,345 --> 01:00:42,007
- Is that yours?
- Meet the Mist Mobile.

803
01:00:51,457 --> 01:00:54,153
SatNav. Got my iPhone,
so I can check the websites

804
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:56,626
for emergencies when I'm driving around.

805
01:00:56,729 --> 01:00:59,596
Got a little bit of mood
lighting right there.

806
01:00:59,699 --> 01:01:01,860
Rearview camera, no big deal.

807
01:01:01,968 --> 01:01:04,266
Check this, you're gonna fucking love this.

808
01:01:08,507 --> 01:01:09,974
The mist.

809
01:01:13,479 --> 01:01:14,639
Hey.

810
01:01:14,814 --> 01:01:16,611
That's right, we're superheroes.
You love us.

811
01:01:22,121 --> 01:01:24,487
- Smoke?
- No.

812
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:27,388
I feel a little weed takes the edge
off things when I'm on patrol, you know?

813
01:01:27,493 --> 01:01:31,452
Going up against a crowd
can get kind of scary, don't you think?

814
01:01:33,065 --> 01:01:34,191
Something wrong?

815
01:01:35,701 --> 01:01:39,000
Yeah. You're so not how I expected.

816
01:01:45,177 --> 01:01:46,906
I got this e-mail from this chick.

817
01:01:47,013 --> 01:01:49,675
She said this guy's
been following her home from work.

818
01:01:50,316 --> 01:01:53,376
I got her address and stuff.
You wanna check it out?

819
01:01:53,486 --> 01:01:55,647
- Sure, why not?
- Cool.

820
01:02:03,229 --> 01:02:05,220
So we're sitting there totally naked, right?

821
01:02:05,431 --> 01:02:09,959
I told her, "Sit on my lap, we'll talk about
the first thing that comes up."

822
01:02:18,477 --> 01:02:21,173
<i>- Yeah?
- Just got the text. He's on his way.</i>

823
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:23,070
<i>He did very good.</i>

824
01:02:23,783 --> 01:02:26,377
<i>- Don't kill him till I get there.
- Right.</i>

825
01:02:32,158 --> 01:02:34,956
Looks like reading all them comics
paid off, huh?

826
01:02:35,294 --> 01:02:37,489
Your boy did good, Frankie.

827
01:02:39,632 --> 01:02:41,293
He's his father's son.

828
01:02:52,878 --> 01:02:54,209
I forgot.

829
01:03:25,711 --> 01:03:27,201
What the fuck?

830
01:03:31,384 --> 01:03:32,874
Shit.

831
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,948
- Hey, what are you doing?
- There are people in there.

832
01:03:37,189 --> 01:03:39,487
Yeah. Shouldn't we call the fire...

833
01:03:41,327 --> 01:03:42,385
Shit!

834
01:04:01,013 --> 01:04:02,002
Mikey.

835
01:04:03,716 --> 01:04:04,910
Fuck.

836
01:04:05,985 --> 01:04:08,112
- Shit. Fuck.
- Red Mist!

837
01:04:10,089 --> 01:04:12,580
Red Mist! Red Mist!

838
01:04:19,598 --> 01:04:22,192
Hey. Hey, man, can you hear me? Hey.

839
01:04:26,205 --> 01:04:27,672
Jesus Christ!

840
01:04:35,047 --> 01:04:38,107
Red Mist! Red Mist!

841
01:04:38,851 --> 01:04:40,716
Where the fuck are you?

842
01:05:15,354 --> 01:05:19,256
We gotta get the hell out of here.
Dude, move your fucking ass!

843
01:05:37,843 --> 01:05:39,777
Holy shit!

844
01:05:40,246 --> 01:05:42,908
- Did you see those bodies?
- Yeah, man.

845
01:05:45,885 --> 01:05:48,513
- Why'd you save the teddy?
- What?

846
01:05:49,221 --> 01:05:51,314
I don't know, man. Come on.

847
01:06:04,436 --> 01:06:05,562
Come.

848
01:06:06,238 --> 01:06:07,830
What the hell are you doing, Frank?

849
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:09,874
You know I can't be here.
What if somebody saw...

850
01:06:09,975 --> 01:06:12,205
That motherfucker Kick-Ass
burnt down my warehouse

851
01:06:12,311 --> 01:06:14,040
and killed my men, Gigante.

852
01:06:14,146 --> 01:06:16,046
Wait, wait, wait. Slow down. Kick-Ass?

853
01:06:16,549 --> 01:06:18,141
- Are you sure?
- You gotta help me, Vic.

854
01:06:18,684 --> 01:06:21,448
My son was there, and he's still missing.

855
01:06:21,687 --> 01:06:25,623
They're all dead!
Everybody in the warehouse is dead.

856
01:06:27,059 --> 01:06:29,357
Put the gun down, Vic. It's Chris.

857
01:06:30,196 --> 01:06:31,629
Chris is Red Mist?

858
01:06:31,730 --> 01:06:33,925
It's not Red Mist you gotta worry about.
It's Kick-Ass.

859
01:06:34,033 --> 01:06:36,831
No, no, no, it's not.
Kick-Ass is just some geek, Dad.

860
01:06:36,936 --> 01:06:40,565
You don't have to worry about him.
You need to watch this.

861
01:06:42,174 --> 01:06:44,665
- Why, what does it do?
- Are you fucking kidding me?

862
01:06:44,777 --> 01:06:47,371
- What?
- God damn it, just sit down.

863
01:06:52,585 --> 01:06:54,416
What are you doing?
What the hell is that thing?

864
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:57,387
You bought this to spy on the nanny
when I was a kid. Don't you remember?

865
01:06:58,357 --> 01:07:00,791
- What, and you put it in the warehouse?
- Yeah, I thought it'd be cool

866
01:07:00,893 --> 01:07:03,794
to put the unmasking of Kick-Ass
on the Internet, okay?

867
01:07:04,129 --> 01:07:05,357
Watch.

868
01:07:09,435 --> 01:07:14,031
<i>I told her, "Sit on my lap, we'll talk about
the first thing that comes up."</i>

869
01:07:16,742 --> 01:07:19,472
<i>- Yeah?
- Just got the text. He's on his way.</i>

870
01:07:20,045 --> 01:07:21,410
<i>He did very good.</i>

871
01:07:21,513 --> 01:07:23,447
<i>- Don't kill him till I get there.
- Right.</i>

872
01:08:38,791 --> 01:08:40,190
Who the hell is this guy?

873
01:08:41,026 --> 01:08:42,493
I don't know, Dad.

874
01:08:43,295 --> 01:08:46,025
But Kick-Ass told me
we're not the only superheroes in town.

875
01:08:46,131 --> 01:08:47,962
Maybe he knows who this guy is.

876
01:08:49,902 --> 01:08:52,132
I want this place locked down.

877
01:08:52,771 --> 01:08:55,262
Nobody comes in, nobody goes out.

878
01:08:57,009 --> 01:08:58,874
Not until somebody finds this cocksucker

879
01:08:58,977 --> 01:09:02,037
and pulls his fucking lungs out
through his ass.

880
01:09:05,317 --> 01:09:07,808
<i>Listen, they're on to you.</i>

881
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:10,286
<i>Do you hear me? They're on to you.</i>

882
01:09:10,389 --> 01:09:12,983
I thought they were looking for Kick-Ass.

883
01:09:13,092 --> 01:09:16,687
<i>Not anymore. Gigante just put on
a little movie-show for us.</i>

884
01:09:16,795 --> 01:09:21,357
Different superhero in a warehouse,
killing a whole bunch of D'Amico's guys.

885
01:09:21,734 --> 01:09:23,531
I'm gonna take a wild guess that was you.

886
01:09:24,636 --> 01:09:27,127
<i>- I killed all the cameras.
- Apparently not.</i>

887
01:09:27,239 --> 01:09:30,231
Look, bro, you need to get ghost.
Hide yourself quick.

888
01:09:31,076 --> 01:09:32,134
Appreciate it.

889
01:09:36,582 --> 01:09:37,708
Mindy,

890
01:09:38,650 --> 01:09:40,083
no more homework, baby doll.

891
01:09:41,353 --> 01:09:43,844
It's time for Frank D'Amico to go bye-bye.

892
01:09:51,897 --> 01:09:56,925
<i>X- Men, the Fantastic Four,
right now, I envy the crap out of them.</i>

893
01:09:58,003 --> 01:10:02,235
<i>Everything was out of control.
I didn't know what the hell to do.</i>

894
01:10:02,474 --> 01:10:06,672
You okay, buddy? You look tired.
Early night tonight, maybe?

895
01:10:06,779 --> 01:10:08,610
<i>And there was no one
I could talk to about it.</i>

896
01:10:08,714 --> 01:10:10,443
Dave? Hello?

897
01:10:10,916 --> 01:10:12,747
Yeah, you bet I will.

898
01:10:15,254 --> 01:10:16,812
<i>I'd never felt more alone.</i>

899
01:10:20,793 --> 01:10:26,129
<i>I'd always dreamed of being a superhero,
but this was a nightmare.</i>

900
01:10:30,669 --> 01:10:33,763
<i>It was time to stop wearing
this stupid costume.</i>

901
01:10:37,376 --> 01:10:40,311
<i>But there was one last
thing I needed it for.</i>

902
01:10:42,448 --> 01:10:46,179
<i>What's the difference between
Spider-Man and Peter Parker?</i>

903
01:10:47,052 --> 01:10:49,350
<i>Spider-Man gets the girl.</i>

904
01:10:57,095 --> 01:10:59,256
Hey, I'm Kick-Ass.

905
01:11:04,102 --> 01:11:06,195
I'm Kick-Ass. You mail me?

906
01:11:07,306 --> 01:11:08,671
Wait...

907
01:11:09,575 --> 01:11:11,805
Fuck! Fuck!

908
01:11:12,044 --> 01:11:15,138
Fucking freak in a mask!
Get out of my house!

909
01:11:15,247 --> 01:11:17,044
I'm not gonna hurt you, all right?

910
01:11:17,149 --> 01:11:19,014
No, no, no! It's me, it's me!

911
01:11:19,117 --> 01:11:21,745
All right?
I was only trying to surprise you. I'm...

912
01:11:21,854 --> 01:11:24,220
- Dave? What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

913
01:11:24,323 --> 01:11:27,224
- Why are you dressed as Kick-Ass?
- Because I am Kick-Ass.

914
01:11:27,626 --> 01:11:31,357
- What are you talking about?
- And I'm also not gay.

915
01:11:32,431 --> 01:11:35,025
- Fuck!
- And I'm an idiot and a shit friend.

916
01:11:35,133 --> 01:11:36,691
I lied to you, I know.

917
01:11:36,802 --> 01:11:39,202
- Oh, my God.
- I know. If it makes you feel any better,

918
01:11:39,304 --> 01:11:43,400
I don't think you can hate me any more
right now than I hate myself.

919
01:11:44,009 --> 01:11:45,636
Please, I'm...

920
01:11:46,778 --> 01:11:48,939
Look, I'm really, really sorry.

921
01:11:50,749 --> 01:11:56,813
I've never met anyone who's as beautiful
and as kind and lovely as you.

922
01:12:01,193 --> 01:12:02,888
You deserve better.

923
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:23,348
- Dave.
- Yes?

924
01:12:24,917 --> 01:12:26,714
My mom has
the burglar alarm on downstairs,

925
01:12:26,818 --> 01:12:29,446
so you should probably use the window.

926
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:36,152
Or...

927
01:12:40,933 --> 01:12:42,525
Or you could just stay.

928
01:12:44,236 --> 01:12:45,294
Stay?

929
01:12:46,104 --> 01:12:47,571
What, like when we have a sleepover?

930
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:57,308
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

931
01:12:59,418 --> 01:13:00,510
Wow.

932
01:13:29,881 --> 01:13:32,111
We gotta get over it,

933
01:13:32,217 --> 01:13:36,017
on top of it, and then into it,
right in the middle of it.

934
01:13:36,121 --> 01:13:37,952
Daddy, I think I found one.

935
01:13:38,056 --> 01:13:41,321
It's perfect,
and they can deliver it in three days.

936
01:13:42,694 --> 01:13:44,889
It's 300,000 bucks.

937
01:13:44,997 --> 01:13:47,022
Can you think of anything else
you'd rather spend it on?

938
01:13:47,132 --> 01:13:49,362
Oh, my gosh!

939
01:13:50,202 --> 01:13:52,830
- That is cool.
- Yeah.

940
01:13:54,172 --> 01:13:55,969
Add to shopping cart.

941
01:13:56,408 --> 01:13:57,432
Okay.

942
01:14:00,145 --> 01:14:03,376
Out of Kick-Ass and Red Mist,
who do you think would win in a fight?

943
01:14:03,782 --> 01:14:06,751
Why are they fighting? That seems stupid.

944
01:14:06,852 --> 01:14:10,754
- What do you think? - I don't
know, but I think Kick-Ass is cuter.

945
01:14:10,856 --> 01:14:12,050
Really?

946
01:14:13,025 --> 01:14:16,654
I, for one, would definitely
fuck his brains out if I got the chance.

947
01:14:18,697 --> 01:14:19,857
You would?

948
01:14:19,965 --> 01:14:21,023
Definitely.

949
01:14:21,633 --> 01:14:24,898
Do you feel like checking out
that new Kate Hudson movie

950
01:14:25,003 --> 01:14:26,732
where she's like a shoe designer,
can't get a guy?

951
01:14:26,838 --> 01:14:30,205
- I think we could make the next showing.
- Hell, yeah.

952
01:14:32,411 --> 01:14:34,436
I guess we're not invited.

953
01:14:35,213 --> 01:14:37,113
All right. You know what? Come here.

954
01:14:37,215 --> 01:14:40,048
I'm going to convert you
to a comics reader right now.

955
01:14:40,519 --> 01:14:44,649
<i>Suddenly, I understood why
superheroes only existed in comic books.</i>

956
01:14:44,756 --> 01:14:48,089
<i>I got why people didn't risk their lives
for strangers.</i>

957
01:14:48,193 --> 01:14:50,491
<i>Because for the first time in my life,</i>

958
01:14:50,595 --> 01:14:53,029
<i>I had something worth living for,</i>

959
01:14:53,131 --> 01:14:54,758
<i>something to lose.</i>

960
01:14:56,735 --> 01:14:58,862
<i>Katie worried about me getting hurt,</i>

961
01:14:58,970 --> 01:15:01,632
<i>so I promised her
my Kick-Ass days were over.</i>

962
01:15:01,740 --> 01:15:04,766
<i>And the truth was I hardly missed it at all.</i>

963
01:15:05,143 --> 01:15:07,873
<i>I hadn't even checked
the website for, like, a week.</i>

964
01:15:11,416 --> 01:15:13,350
Okay, I'm off then.

965
01:15:14,152 --> 01:15:16,586
- No Katie tonight?
- Tomorrow.

966
01:15:16,888 --> 01:15:20,119
Wednesdays, she's got
one of those volunteer things.

967
01:15:20,225 --> 01:15:22,989
You seem like a different guy,
you know that?

968
01:15:23,095 --> 01:15:27,225
Your mom would have been so happy
to see you out of your shell like this.

969
01:15:27,332 --> 01:15:28,959
Have a good night.

970
01:15:39,845 --> 01:15:42,211
<i>- Hey, baby.
- Hey, what's going on?</i>

971
01:15:42,881 --> 01:15:44,439
I gotta do a Kick-Ass thing.

972
01:15:44,983 --> 01:15:47,281
What? I thought you were done with that.

973
01:15:47,385 --> 01:15:49,512
<i>This is the last time. I totally swear.</i>

974
01:15:50,722 --> 01:15:51,916
I worry about you.

975
01:15:52,791 --> 01:15:55,123
Well, I wish you wouldn't worry.

976
01:15:55,494 --> 01:15:56,984
<i>I can't help it. I do because I...</i>

977
01:15:59,431 --> 01:16:01,228
I care about you a lot.

978
01:16:04,302 --> 01:16:06,429
I care about you a lot, too.

979
01:16:37,569 --> 01:16:38,866
This better be pretty serious, dude,

980
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:41,404
'cause I promised my girlfriend
that I'm done with all this shit.

981
01:16:41,506 --> 01:16:44,066
How about both of us being dead?
Is that serious enough for you?

982
01:16:44,876 --> 01:16:47,037
Dead? How?

983
01:16:47,345 --> 01:16:49,506
It turns out
those dead guys from the warehouse

984
01:16:49,614 --> 01:16:53,015
had some bad motherfuckers for friends,
and they think we did that shit.

985
01:16:53,118 --> 01:16:55,109
There's a price on our heads, man.

986
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:57,450
A price on our heads?
What is this, the Wild West?

987
01:16:57,556 --> 01:17:00,320
I'm not messing with you, dude.
They found out where I lived.

988
01:17:00,425 --> 01:17:02,120
They trashed my place. I'm fucking screwed.

989
01:17:02,227 --> 01:17:04,855
- And you're gonna be next, okay?
- What?

990
01:17:08,133 --> 01:17:09,191
Shit.

991
01:17:10,535 --> 01:17:11,593
What do we do?

992
01:17:14,906 --> 01:17:17,636
Remember you mentioned
that there are other superheroes?

993
01:17:18,109 --> 01:17:19,098
Yeah?

994
01:17:20,078 --> 01:17:21,739
Well, do you think they can help us?

995
01:17:31,122 --> 01:17:33,522
Hot chocolate, extra marshmallows.

996
01:17:36,728 --> 01:17:40,061
Man, that looks even cooler
than it did in the picture.

997
01:17:40,165 --> 01:17:44,465
Child, you know, that's because
in the picture, it didn't have Gatling guns.

998
01:17:44,803 --> 01:17:46,031
Nice job.

999
01:17:46,638 --> 01:17:47,969
I'm gonna take mine to bed, okay?

1000
01:17:48,073 --> 01:17:50,439
Okay, baby doll. Sleep tight.

1001
01:17:50,542 --> 01:17:53,033
Thanks. Kick-Ass?

1002
01:17:54,479 --> 01:17:57,073
You go get dressed.
I'll tell him to meet us at Safe House B.

1003
01:17:57,182 --> 01:17:59,309
We'll have our hot chocolate
when we get back.

1004
01:17:59,417 --> 01:18:01,248
- Okay, Daddy.
- Come on.

1005
01:18:10,762 --> 01:18:12,024
- There you go.
- All right.

1006
01:18:12,530 --> 01:18:14,760
- Do you know where that is?
- No, but I'll just put it in the GPS.

1007
01:18:14,866 --> 01:18:17,357
- It's what it's for.
- All right, let's go.

1008
01:18:18,637 --> 01:18:19,695
Shit.

1009
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:57,292
Okay, okay, okay.

1010
01:20:05,010 --> 01:20:09,743
Well, here you are and Red Mist, too.

1011
01:20:15,286 --> 01:20:17,686
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Good to meet you, sir.

1012
01:20:18,323 --> 01:20:19,881
Please, come in.

1013
01:20:20,425 --> 01:20:21,722
After you.

1014
01:20:24,996 --> 01:20:26,964
Hit Girl, manners, honey.

1015
01:20:29,768 --> 01:20:31,360
Hi, I'm Hit Girl.

1016
01:20:32,670 --> 01:20:34,365
No!

1017
01:20:36,674 --> 01:20:38,335
No!

1018
01:20:40,245 --> 01:20:42,406
Your ass is mine! Come on.

1019
01:20:42,514 --> 01:20:43,879
No, he's with me. He's okay.

1020
01:20:43,982 --> 01:20:46,450
Shut the fuck up, kid.
Your daddy's the boss. You go home.

1021
01:20:46,551 --> 01:20:49,782
Are you shitting me? No, he's fine.
He's with me.

1022
01:20:50,121 --> 01:20:52,988
- Let him go.
- Get out of here. Get the fuck out of here.

1023
01:20:53,091 --> 01:20:54,922
Hot damn. I always wanted one of these.

1024
01:20:55,026 --> 01:20:56,687
- You're seriously gonna take that?
- Yes.

1025
01:20:56,795 --> 01:20:57,819
Come on, sweet cheeks.

1026
01:21:02,367 --> 01:21:03,994
If you don't get your
wannabe superhero ass in the car...

1027
01:21:04,102 --> 01:21:05,592
- That's funny.
- ...you're gonna have a lot of trouble

1028
01:21:05,703 --> 01:21:07,534
- on your hands.
- That's really funny. You're so fired.

1029
01:21:07,639 --> 01:21:10,164
- Kick-Ass...
- Get him out of here. Get him out of here.

1030
01:21:10,275 --> 01:21:12,505
- Get him in the van.
- Let go of me. Put me down.

1031
01:21:12,610 --> 01:21:14,168
Kick-Ass, I'm sorry!

1032
01:21:14,712 --> 01:21:16,873
- Get in the car.
- Get in there!

1033
01:21:29,594 --> 01:21:31,755
You better fire this asshole.

1034
01:21:31,996 --> 01:21:33,463
Ignore him...

1035
01:21:34,466 --> 01:21:35,763
A bazooka?

1036
01:21:38,269 --> 01:21:40,464
- Okay.
- We had a deal, Dad.

1037
01:21:40,572 --> 01:21:43,200
We had a fucking deal
that I would get you the guy who did it,

1038
01:21:43,308 --> 01:21:46,937
and all I'm asking is you let Kick-Ass go.
He didn't do anything wrong.

1039
01:21:47,045 --> 01:21:50,674
Chris, you got to look at this
from my point of view. Okay?

1040
01:21:50,782 --> 01:21:53,580
I gotta send a public service message
to the people out there

1041
01:21:54,018 --> 01:21:56,486
that being a superhero
is bad for your health.

1042
01:21:56,588 --> 01:21:59,182
And the Big motherfucker?
Nobody knows who he is.

1043
01:21:59,290 --> 01:22:02,817
- Yeah, but that's not fair!
- Yeah, life's not fair, kid. Get over it.

1044
01:22:02,927 --> 01:22:04,258
What are you gonna do to them?

1045
01:22:05,196 --> 01:22:07,460
You really wanna be a part of my business?

1046
01:22:10,235 --> 01:22:11,259
Yeah.

1047
01:22:11,369 --> 01:22:14,497
Then sit down, shut up and watch.

1048
01:22:23,414 --> 01:22:26,611
<i>Frank, we're ready. Enjoy the show.</i>

1049
01:22:26,718 --> 01:22:28,811
- Are you controlling this right now?
- I sure am.

1063
01:23:01,686 --> 01:23:03,244
Why else would I be here?

1064
01:23:03,354 --> 01:23:06,721
<i>There's no idea as to who is behind
the broadcast of this show,</i>

1065
01:23:06,824 --> 01:23:09,315
<i>but we could see
widespread server crashes...</i>

1066
01:23:10,295 --> 01:23:12,286
Dave, why didn't you tell me
this is what you were doing?

1067
01:23:12,397 --> 01:23:14,262
You're on the news. Call me.

1068
01:23:14,365 --> 01:23:17,596
<i>We go now over live to the countdown
clock as we are moments away.</i>

1069
01:23:30,215 --> 01:23:31,546
Show time.

1070
01:23:33,685 --> 01:23:35,516
<i>Hello, boys and girls.</i>

1071
01:23:36,020 --> 01:23:37,453
<i>Now, this...</i>

1072
01:23:38,723 --> 01:23:40,190
<i>Well, you know who this guy is.</i>

1073
01:23:40,291 --> 01:23:43,089
<i>And this guy here is Big Daddy.</i>

1074
01:23:43,761 --> 01:23:45,922
And these are my friends.

1075
01:23:46,030 --> 01:23:48,055
Come on in, guys, say hello.

1076
01:23:48,166 --> 01:23:51,499
Yeah, yeah, there they are. Hello, hello.

1077
01:23:51,603 --> 01:23:55,061
Now Big Daddy and Kick-Ass
are gonna help us

1078
01:23:55,173 --> 01:23:59,667
<i>show you why being a hero is a bad idea.</i>

1079
01:24:00,245 --> 01:24:01,678
<i>You know what a silent "K" is?</i>

1080
01:24:02,213 --> 01:24:04,078
That's when "K" is
at the beginning of the word,

1081
01:24:04,182 --> 01:24:06,980
but you don't pronounce it.
Like in the word "Knuckleduster."

1082
01:24:07,085 --> 01:24:09,576
Show them what
a knuckleduster can do, guy.

1083
01:24:10,555 --> 01:24:12,750
That must have hurt!
Let's see that again from the other side.

1084
01:24:12,857 --> 01:24:15,223
Go on. Yeah, I think it did.

1085
01:24:15,326 --> 01:24:19,729
<i>Now in France, they say the word "stick"
like this, baston.</i>

1086
01:24:20,131 --> 01:24:21,689
<i>We got some of Kick-Ass's bastons.</i>

1087
01:24:21,799 --> 01:24:24,734
We're gonna show you what they can do.
Go ahead, boys.

1088
01:24:27,972 --> 01:24:31,840
<i>In America, we say "stick" like this.
Baseball bat.</i>

1089
01:24:32,343 --> 01:24:36,370
Which is very good
for hitting knees and stomachs.

1090
01:24:36,481 --> 01:24:38,972
It's also good for hitting balls.

1091
01:24:39,951 --> 01:24:42,010
<i>Know what else we do?
We don't do them individually.</i>

1092
01:24:42,353 --> 01:24:46,084
We do them all together.
Gentlemen, please.

1093
01:24:46,190 --> 01:24:49,182
Yeah. This looks very painful.

1094
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:56,823
<i>Due to the distressing nature of the images,
we are unable to broadcast the events</i>

1095
01:24:56,934 --> 01:24:58,765
<i>currently streaming live on the Internet.</i>

1096
01:24:58,870 --> 01:25:01,065
- Fuck.
- No. No, no, no.

1097
01:25:03,374 --> 01:25:07,401
<i>Despite initial speculation that this may be
some kind of hoax or publicity stunt,</i>

1098
01:25:07,512 --> 01:25:10,743
<i>it is now clear that the hostages
are in genuine danger,</i>

1099
01:25:10,848 --> 01:25:15,217
<i>that all signs point to the intention to
stage a live execution in the next few minutes.</i>

1100
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:32,931
<i>Even with my metal plates
and my fucked-up nerve endings,</i>

1101
01:25:33,037 --> 01:25:35,665
<i>I got to tell you, that hurt.</i>

1102
01:25:38,076 --> 01:25:39,543
<i>The kerosene.</i>

1103
01:25:39,911 --> 01:25:41,401
<i>Yes, the silent killer.</i>

1104
01:25:41,512 --> 01:25:45,346
<i>But not half as much as the idea
of leaving everything behind.</i>

1105
01:25:45,850 --> 01:25:47,147
<i>Katie,</i>

1106
01:25:47,251 --> 01:25:48,513
<i>my dad,</i>

1107
01:25:49,187 --> 01:25:50,518
<i>Todd and Marty.</i>

1108
01:25:51,022 --> 01:25:55,118
<i>And all the things I'd never do,
like learn to drive,</i>

1109
01:25:55,827 --> 01:25:58,352
<i>or see what me and Katie's kids
would look like</i>

1110
01:25:58,463 --> 01:26:00,363
<i>or find out what happened on Lost.</i>

1111
01:26:00,465 --> 01:26:01,523
Spicy, spicy.

1112
01:26:01,632 --> 01:26:03,224
<i>And if you're reassuring yourself</i>

1113
01:26:03,334 --> 01:26:06,462
<i>that I'm gonna make it through this

1114

<i>quit being such a smartass.</i>

1115
01:26:09,774 --> 01:26:15,269
<i>Hell, dude, you never seen Sin City,
Sunset Blvd., American Beauty?</i>

1116
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:19,272
And this, for all you cavemen out there,

1117
01:26:20,451 --> 01:26:21,941
is fire.

1118
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:24,146
No.

1119
01:26:30,027 --> 01:26:31,119
I know.

1120
01:26:31,729 --> 01:26:33,253
<i>Fire. Fire is good.</i>

1121
01:26:34,832 --> 01:26:36,857
Fire is our friend.

1122
01:26:37,802 --> 01:26:39,133
Yeah, yeah.

1123
01:26:45,476 --> 01:26:46,465
<i>Gentlemen,</i>

1124
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:50,279
time to die.

1125
01:26:56,154 --> 01:26:57,143
What the...

1126
01:27:02,059 --> 01:27:05,654
What the fuck just happened? Hey, hey.
Somebody find the lights.

1127
01:27:06,230 --> 01:27:07,356
Hello!

1128
01:27:08,666 --> 01:27:09,826
Jimmy.

1129
01:27:18,709 --> 01:27:20,006
Jesus Christ.

1130
01:27:21,179 --> 01:27:23,044
Bobby? Bobby?

1131
01:27:56,547 --> 01:27:57,878
Get the lighter!

1132
01:27:58,850 --> 01:28:01,341
It's on the floor right over there.
Find the lighter.

1133
01:28:07,191 --> 01:28:08,419
I got it.

1134
01:28:22,707 --> 01:28:25,403
- No!
- Take cover, child.

1135
01:28:30,982 --> 01:28:34,679
Now switch to Kryptonite.

1136
01:28:35,152 --> 01:28:36,483
Kryptonite.

1137
01:29:06,017 --> 01:29:09,817
Go to Robin's Revenge!

1138
01:29:09,921 --> 01:29:11,616
Robin, Robin.

1139
01:29:56,801 --> 01:29:58,291
<i>Show's over, motherfuckers.</i>

1140
01:30:03,708 --> 01:30:06,472
Yeah! I think I'm in love with her, dude.

1141
01:30:06,877 --> 01:30:09,345
She looks like
she's about 11 years old, but...

1142
01:30:09,447 --> 01:30:12,746
I can wait!
I solemnly vow to save myself for her.

1143
01:30:13,818 --> 01:30:16,946
That should be really difficult for you.
Are you okay?

1144
01:30:17,421 --> 01:30:18,513
Yeah.

1145
01:30:37,875 --> 01:30:39,137
Good job.

1146
01:30:47,785 --> 01:30:50,049
I'm so proud of you, baby doll.

1147
01:30:52,790 --> 01:30:54,223
Are you okay?

1148
01:30:59,964 --> 01:31:03,229
But getting shot, Daddy,
it hurt a lot more than when you did it.

1149
01:31:05,169 --> 01:31:08,866
That's 'cause I used
low velocity rounds, child.

1150
01:31:13,711 --> 01:31:15,576
You're the kindest daddy
in the whole world.

1151
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:17,679
No, I just...

1152
01:31:20,751 --> 01:31:22,082
I love you.

1153
01:31:27,391 --> 01:31:28,722
I love you, too, Daddy.

1154
01:31:36,967 --> 01:31:38,798
I love you, too, Daddy.

1155
01:31:40,371 --> 01:31:41,736
Sleep tight.

1156
01:32:00,991 --> 01:32:02,219
What's your name?

1157
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:04,987
I mean your real name.

1158
01:32:05,396 --> 01:32:07,956
A superhero never reveals his true identity.

1159
01:32:08,065 --> 01:32:10,625
What? Look, you can't go on...

1160
01:32:12,303 --> 01:32:14,430
However you lived before,

1161
01:32:18,075 --> 01:32:19,167
it's over.

1162
01:32:21,612 --> 01:32:24,479
Is there anybody else? Your family or...

1163
01:32:24,582 --> 01:32:26,880
Look, I can take care of myself.

1164
01:32:27,651 --> 01:32:29,380
I saved your sorry ass.

1165
01:32:30,321 --> 01:32:34,280
What about money, huh? All right,
'cause you got to think long term.

1166
01:32:34,391 --> 01:32:36,951
I've got $3 million in a suitcase.

1167
01:32:38,129 --> 01:32:40,461
That "long term" enough for you?

1168
01:32:43,267 --> 01:32:45,428
It's not all about the money.

1169
01:32:46,771 --> 01:32:48,068
I owe you.

1170
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:51,665
If it wasn't for you, I'd be dead.

1171
01:32:53,010 --> 01:32:55,001
And if it wasn't for you,

1172
01:32:56,514 --> 01:32:57,674
my dad wouldn't be.

1173
01:33:15,232 --> 01:33:16,290
Look,

1174
01:33:17,434 --> 01:33:20,926
pack up whatever you need
and we'll go back to my place.

1175
01:33:22,373 --> 01:33:24,398
I just need to clean my...

1176
01:33:25,042 --> 01:33:26,168
Just go.

1177
01:34:21,565 --> 01:34:26,059
I meant like pajamas and clothes and stuff.
You can't take that stuff to my house.

1178
01:34:26,337 --> 01:34:27,998
You know what my dad
really would have wanted?

1179
01:34:33,911 --> 01:34:36,539
He would have wanted me
to finish what we started.

1180
01:34:37,815 --> 01:34:39,407
And that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

1181
01:34:56,867 --> 01:34:59,062
Is this Frank D'Amico's place?

1182
01:34:59,770 --> 01:35:01,397
All that security?

1183
01:35:01,939 --> 01:35:05,340
- Are you crazy?
- My mom already died for nothing.

1184
01:35:06,744 --> 01:35:09,736
So I'm sure as hell
not gonna let my dad die for nothing, too.

1185
01:35:12,149 --> 01:35:13,616
You can't do this on your own.

1186
01:35:16,086 --> 01:35:17,280
Exactly.

1187
01:35:20,090 --> 01:35:21,648
Do you wanna deal with owing my dad?

1188
01:35:23,827 --> 01:35:25,988
Then shut the hell up
and pick your weapon.

1189
01:35:35,239 --> 01:35:36,672
Is that what I think it is?

1190
01:35:38,342 --> 01:35:39,673
Damn straight.

1191
01:35:39,777 --> 01:35:42,268
And you better start
reading the instructions,

1192
01:35:42,379 --> 01:35:45,780
'cause you're gonna be
using it in about five minutes.

1193
01:35:52,990 --> 01:35:56,221
Yo, listen up. We got five minutes,
then I want you back on your posts.

1194
01:35:56,593 --> 01:35:58,060
And don't leave a mess.

1195
01:36:12,810 --> 01:36:15,677
- Everything okay?
- Everything's all right, boss.

1196
01:36:17,514 --> 01:36:19,345
I can't believe I got my gun back.
Look at that.

1197
01:36:20,050 --> 01:36:21,677
You know, it's not the...

1198
01:36:25,923 --> 01:36:27,220
Let her in.

1199
01:36:30,527 --> 01:36:33,553
It's a little kid. What's
the matter with you?

1200
01:36:37,735 --> 01:36:39,532
You okay, sweetheart?

1201
01:36:39,737 --> 01:36:40,761
I...

1202
01:36:41,705 --> 01:36:43,297
I lost my mommy and daddy.

1203
01:36:44,074 --> 01:36:45,598
She lost her mommy and daddy.

1204
01:36:47,077 --> 01:36:49,272
You want to use my cell phone?

1205
01:36:50,314 --> 01:36:52,612
Now can you remember the number?

1206
01:37:01,892 --> 01:37:02,950
Help!

1207
01:37:36,326 --> 01:37:38,692
<i>Had I ever been a real superhero?</i>

1208
01:37:39,663 --> 01:37:42,257

Get in here. Help me out!

1219
01:40:34,504 --> 01:40:37,064
Holy fuck, Fashion, everybody's dead.

1220
01:40:39,309 --> 01:40:41,243
She's behind the counter.
She's out of ammo, okay?

1221
01:40:57,027 --> 01:40:59,120
Do you think they got them?

1222
01:40:59,229 --> 01:41:01,163
If they didn't, he will.

1223
01:41:02,499 --> 01:41:04,057
Get out there.

1224
01:41:04,268 --> 01:41:05,257
Now?

1225
01:41:05,369 --> 01:41:06,666
Yeah, now.

1226
01:41:17,281 --> 01:41:18,509
What the fuck is going on?

1227
01:41:18,615 --> 01:41:20,378
We got her trapped. She's unarmed.

1228
01:41:20,484 --> 01:41:22,782
So what in the hell
are you guys waiting for?

1229
01:41:22,886 --> 01:41:24,478
- Go get her.
- Go on, man.

1230
01:41:24,588 --> 01:41:26,453
- Go get her.
- I ain't got no fucking gun.

1231
01:41:26,556 --> 01:41:28,148
I'm not going in.

1232
01:41:29,860 --> 01:41:31,191
You do now.

1233
01:41:32,262 --> 01:41:33,490
Now move.

1234
01:41:53,483 --> 01:41:56,384
Fuck this shit. I'm getting the bazooka.

1235
01:41:58,822 --> 01:41:59,811
Bazooka?

1236
01:42:00,490 --> 01:42:01,514
Bazooka?

1237
01:42:03,026 --> 01:42:05,494
It's only me, boss.
Everything's under control.

1238
01:42:17,908 --> 01:42:22,140
Under control? You're grabbing
a fucking bazooka, you dumbass.

1239
01:42:24,214 --> 01:42:25,238
Sir?

1240
01:42:27,250 --> 01:42:28,376
Do it.

1241
01:42:49,806 --> 01:42:50,966
I always wanted to say this.

1242
01:42:53,777 --> 01:42:56,268
Say hello to my little friend!

1243
01:43:27,844 --> 01:43:29,243
Dirty motherfuckers!

1244
01:43:55,405 --> 01:43:56,702
Holy shit.

1245
01:44:05,315 --> 01:44:07,681
That is one weird-sounding bazooka.

1246
01:44:07,784 --> 01:44:08,808
Stu!

1247
01:44:14,458 --> 01:44:15,516
Fuck!

1248
01:44:25,669 --> 01:44:26,863
Get him.

1249
01:44:36,179 --> 01:44:37,942
Playtime's over, kid.

1250
01:44:39,182 --> 01:44:40,774
I never play.

1251
01:44:42,018 --> 01:44:43,315
Oh, really?

1252
01:46:01,197 --> 01:46:02,528
Ruin my business, huh?

1253
01:46:04,467 --> 01:46:07,334
Kill every single fucking guy on my payroll?

1254
01:46:37,334 --> 01:46:39,325
God, I wish I had a son like you.

1255
01:46:46,309 --> 01:46:48,300
Time for a family reunion.

1256
01:46:50,013 --> 01:46:51,105
Hey.

1257
01:46:51,881 --> 01:46:54,782
Why don't you pick on someone
your own size?

1258
01:47:14,004 --> 01:47:15,972
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1259
01:47:17,540 --> 01:47:18,939
Time to go home.

1260
01:48:56,005 --> 01:48:57,267
Thanks, Kick-Ass.

1261
01:48:57,841 --> 01:48:59,172
My daddy,

1262
01:49:01,811 --> 01:49:03,836
he would have been proud of both of us.

1263
01:49:14,457 --> 01:49:15,446
Dave.

1264
01:49:16,559 --> 01:49:17,992
Dave Lizewski.

1265
01:49:18,428 --> 01:49:19,656
I know that, dumbass.

1266
01:49:31,107 --> 01:49:32,233
Mindy.

1267
01:49:33,910 --> 01:49:35,400
Mindy Macready.

1268
01:49:52,028 --> 01:49:53,757
- Have a good day. Bye.
- Bye.

1269
01:49:56,533 --> 01:49:59,559
<i>Mindy moved in with Marcus,
and he enrolled her at my school.</i>

1270
01:49:59,669 --> 01:50:01,261
- Bye.
- Good luck.

1271
01:50:02,338 --> 01:50:06,172
<i>First school she'd ever been to,
on the promise that I'd look out for her.</i>

1272
01:50:07,443 --> 01:50:08,410
Hey.

1273
01:50:08,511 --> 01:50:09,978
<i>Not that she needed me to.</i>

1274
01:50:10,079 --> 01:50:11,512
Hey, new kid.

1275
01:50:11,881 --> 01:50:12,905
Hi.

1276
01:50:13,449 --> 01:50:14,848
Lunch money.

1277
01:50:15,451 --> 01:50:16,509
Now.

1278
01:50:24,460 --> 01:50:27,020
<i>Kick-Ass was gone, but not forgotten.</i>

1279
01:50:28,198 --> 01:50:31,326
<i>And my world was much safer
with all the new superheroes.</i>

1280
01:50:32,635 --> 01:50:34,796
<i>They said I was their inspiration,</i>

1281
01:50:35,305 --> 01:50:38,035
<i>but all I did was make a door
into a world I'd dreamed about</i>

1282
01:50:38,141 --> 01:50:40,075
<i>since I was a little kid.</i>

1283
01:50:40,777 --> 01:50:43,177
A world full of superheroes, huh?

1284
01:50:45,582 --> 01:50:47,573
As a great man once said,

1285
01:50:50,486 --> 01:50:52,886
"Wait till they get a load of me."
