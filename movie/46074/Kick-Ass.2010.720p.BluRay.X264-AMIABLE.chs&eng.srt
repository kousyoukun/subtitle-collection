Think about it. Come on, it'd be awesome.
想想,那多好啊

要是那家伙那么跟我说话,我绝对会扁他一顿

Todd,你什么时候扁过人啊?

Whatever, man.
I would have just gone for his knees.
管他呢,我直接攻他膝盖

the whole superhero thing, though.
我并不喜欢超级英雄这个东西

So I guess you're not gonna line up
for that new Kick-Ass comic then?
那我猜你不会去排队买超畔赖穆画了?

515
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:46,709
I guess not.
我猜不会

516
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:50,045
But you know what?
I was seriously thinking of mailing his site.
不过跟你说,我真得很想给他发信

517
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,631
I mean, I could really use some help
from a guy like that right now.

嗯,有个叫Rasul的家伙,我特别可怜他

about his upbringing and stuff, I just...
我越是了解他的教养之类的,我就……

- One guy?
- I think.

- 我猜是

606

the biggest bunch of pussies in New York.
靠,要是这样,我们八成就像是纽约最大的一帮胆小鬼

What do you want me to do?
你希望我咋办?

608

我要拿超畔雷鋈送反串香

I didn't say anything to anyone, I swear.
我谁都没告诉,我发誓

这很明智,挨扁侠,要保持下去

611
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:58,403
You know what this is?
知道这是什么吗?

612
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:03,075
It's all the cartridge crap that comes out
of your gay little Taser when you fire it.
这是从你那个Gay型泰瑟枪上打出来的电芯

613
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:06,870
You do know the police could have traced
this right back to you if they'd found it?
你知道警察能用这玩意儿追踪到你吧?

614
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:09,623

It's a shame. You have potential.
真可惜,你蛮有潜质的

626

How do I get a hold of you?
我怎么联系你们?

628

打电话给市长,他会向空中发特殊信号

629
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:02,968

- 诶?诶?咋回事儿?
- 咋回事儿?

635

但这次我恐怕帮不了你的忙

637

Little bit outside my jurisdiction.

Outside your jurisdiction?

You're a fucking cop, and he's breaking the law.
你他妈的是警察,他犯法了

640
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:42,340

it's ball-deep in your jurisdiction's ass.
绝对在你的职权范围里,他鸡巴都插在你职权的屁眼里了

641
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,470
Listen, cops pay me to nail the bad guys,
you pay me not to.
听着,警察花钱让我去抓坏人,你花钱让我别去

642
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,597
Everything else is in the gray area.
其他的都是灰色地带

643

Yeah. Fuck you very much, Vic. Just do it, okay?
是吗,操死你妈逼的,Vic  帮我办了,行不?

Hey, I won't say nothing to nobody.
嘿,这事儿我谁都不会告诉的

You have done self tan before, right?

就是单词以K打头

1117
01:24:03,789 --> 01:24:06,624
but you don't pronounce it.
Like in the word "Knuckleduster."
但不发K的音 就像“老虎指”这个词一样

01:24:06,709 --> 01:24:09,252
Show them what a knuckleduster can do, guy.
让他们看看老虎指能干什么

在美国 我们把“棍”这个词说成“棒球棍”

Which is very good for hitting knees and stomachs.
适合击打膝盖和肚子

1126

It's also good for hitting balls.

01:24:39,575 --> 01:24:41,659
Know what else we do? We don't do them individually.
知道我们还会干什么吗?我们不习惯一个一个上

1128
01:24:41,952 --> 01:24:45,705
We do them all together. Gentlemen, please.
我们喜欢群殴  先生们,请吧

1129
01:24:45,789 --> 01:24:48,833
Yeah. This looks very painful.
哈哈,看起来疼得不轻啊

1130

Yes, the silent killer.
没错,沉默杀手

真被枪打的时候,老爸,比你打我时痛多了
