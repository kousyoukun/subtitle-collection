1
00:01:27,542 --> 00:01:30,834
因为有太多的谣言和猜测。
Because there has been so much rumor and speculation.

2
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:36,625
让我给你讲一下整个故事。
Let me tell you the whole story.

3
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:43,209
根据龙钟的时间，
According to the time dragon clock,

4
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:47,000
融化发生在第13个小时。
the melting occurred at the 13th hour.

5
00:01:51,167 --> 00:01:52,560
一桶
The direct result of a bucket of

6
00:01:52,584 --> 00:01:54,167
一名女童泼出的水。
water thrown by a female child.

7
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,501
是的，西方的邪恶女巫死了。
Yes, the wicked witch of the west is dead.

8
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,501
看，这是格伦达。
Look, it's Glenda.

9
00:04:37,502 --> 00:04:39,002
很高兴见到我，不是吗？
It's good to see me, isn't it?

10
00:04:45,502 --> 00:04:48,543
澳大利亚同胞们，请允许我澄清一下。
Fellow Aussians, let me set the record straight.

11
00:04:51,002 --> 00:04:52,002
是的。
Yes.

12
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,252
西方的邪恶女巫死了。
The wicked witch of the west is dead.

13
00:06:36,003 --> 00:06:38,003
是的。
Yes.

14
00:06:40,503 --> 00:06:42,003
邪恶为何会发生？
Why does wickedness happen?

15
00:06:46,003 --> 00:06:47,003
这是个好问题。
That's a good question.

16
00:06:47,544 --> 00:06:49,395
当很多人发现它
When many people find it

17
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:52,378
令人困惑的是，人天生就是邪恶的吗？
confusing, are people born wicked?

18
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:55,419
还是他们遭遇了邪恶？
Or do they have wickedness thrust upon them?

19
00:06:57,003 --> 00:06:59,753
毕竟，邪恶的女巫也有童年。
After all, the wicked witch had a childhood.

20
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,271
她有一个父亲，顺便说一句，他有一个
She had a father, who by the way, had

21
00:07:03,295 --> 00:07:04,979
被任命为芒奇金兰总督。
been appointed governor of Munchkinland.

22
00:07:05,003 --> 00:07:06,295
亲爱的，我要去参加集会了。
I'm off to the assembly, dear.

23
00:07:06,586 --> 00:07:08,687
和许多人一样，她也有母亲。
And she had a mother, as so many do.

24
00:07:08,711 --> 00:07:12,336
我多么不想离开并让你孤单一人。
How I hate to go and leave you lonely.

25
00:07:12,795 --> 00:07:16,003
没关系，太孤独了，就一晚。
That's all right, it's so lonely, just one night.

26
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,812
但要知道你就在我的
But know that you're here in my

27
00:07:19,836 --> 00:07:23,586
心，而我却离开你的灵魂。
heart, while I'm out of your soul.

28
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,295
像每个家庭一样，他们有自己的秘密。
Like every family, they have their secrets.

29
00:08:02,545 --> 00:08:10,545
一件事引发另一件事，正如通常的情况那样。
And one thing led to another, as it so often does.

30
00:08:13,045 --> 00:08:14,229
但从女巫
But from the moment the witch

31
00:08:14,253 --> 00:08:18,670
出生后，她就完全不同了。
was born, she was well different.

32
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:06,504
把它拿走。
Take it away.

33
00:09:14,504 --> 00:09:15,712
把它拿走！
Take it away!

34
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:27,504
没关系，小家伙。
It's all right, little one.

35
00:09:28,296 --> 00:09:29,296
嘘。
Shh.

36
00:09:30,046 --> 00:09:32,129
我们会照顾你的。
We'll look after you.

37
00:09:35,754 --> 00:09:38,171
因此，她由她的保姆杜尔塞·贝尔 (Dulce Bear) 抚养长大。
So her nanny, Dulce Bear, raised her.

38
00:09:39,254 --> 00:09:42,087
随着她的成长，她面临的挑战也日益增加。
And as she grew, so did her challenges.

39
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:45,963
杜尔塞熊，来了，州长。
Dulce Bear, coming, Governor.

40
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:48,879
小家伙，照顾好你的小妹妹。
Little one, watch your baby sister.

41
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:50,129
只是时钟滴答声。
Just a clock tick.

42
00:09:51,504 --> 00:09:55,004
哦，纳塞罗斯，别担心。
Oh, Nasseros, don't you worry.

43
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:56,629
我在这里。
I'm here.

44
00:09:57,629 --> 00:09:59,421
现在，你想看一些令人惊奇的东西吗？
Now, you wanna see something amazing?

45
00:10:00,213 --> 00:10:00,421
是的。
Yeah.

46
00:10:01,129 --> 00:10:04,296
这一切都与我们奇妙的绿野仙踪有关。
This is all about our wonderful Wizard of Oz.

47
00:10:05,129 --> 00:10:06,546
你知道我们是怎么到这里来的吗？
Do you know how we got here?

48
00:10:07,213 --> 00:10:08,213
不。
No.

49
00:10:08,796 --> 00:10:10,796
从天上下来，坐气球。
From the sky, in a balloon.

50
00:10:11,546 --> 00:10:12,546
看？
See?

51
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,397
然后他建造了一座名为翡翠的城市，
Then he built a city named Emeralds,

52
00:10:16,421 --> 00:10:20,129
因为他喜欢祖母绿，尽管它们是绿色的。
cuz he loves emeralds, even though they're green.

53
00:10:20,546 --> 00:10:23,171
纳赛尔，你没有什么秘密。
And Nasser, you are no secret.

54
00:10:24,171 --> 00:10:27,630
如果你成为他，他就会满足你一个严厉的愿望。
If you get to be him, he grants you a harsh desire.

55
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:29,963
Allem 错了。
Allem is wrong.

56
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,338
我们需要我们的顶尖人才。
We need our top.

57
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,588
有人让我们失望，每个人都很聪明。
Someone brought us down and everyone is smart.

58
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:40,755
你从哪里来？
Where did you come from?

59
00:10:55,963 --> 00:10:57,963
好工作。
Good job.

60
00:11:01,505 --> 00:11:03,171
现在，从正面看。
Now, from the front.

61
00:11:04,171 --> 00:11:05,421
这段时间你做了什么？
What have you done this time?

62
00:11:06,338 --> 00:11:07,672
好的，没关系，爸爸。
OK, that's OK, Daddy.

63
00:11:07,963 --> 00:11:09,547
现在你让你姐姐哭了。
Now you've made your sister cry.

64
00:11:10,338 --> 00:11:11,978
我们去拿你那块漂亮的蛋糕吧。
Let's go get your beautiful piece of cake.

65
00:11:14,213 --> 00:11:15,797
没关系，小家伙。
It's all right, little one.

66
00:11:16,297 --> 00:11:18,088
他不应该责怪你。
He shouldn't have blamed you.

67
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,880
没看见，熊。
Don't see, bear.

68
00:11:22,797 --> 00:11:29,338
所以，这并不容易。
And so, it couldn't have been easy.

69
00:12:57,506 --> 00:12:58,506
是的？
Yes?

70
00:12:59,506 --> 00:13:01,547
嗯，这很有趣。
Well, this has been fun.

71
00:13:01,922 --> 00:13:03,065
你可以想象，我已经
As you can imagine, I have

72
00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:04,482
巫师们要做的事情很多
much to attend to with the wizards

73
00:13:04,506 --> 00:13:05,690
意外的离开。
unexpected departure.

74
00:13:05,714 --> 00:13:09,506
如果没有其他问题的话我就要走了。
So if there are no further questions, I'm going to go.

75
00:13:10,714 --> 00:13:12,524
Linda，这是真的吗？
Linda, is it true?

76
00:13:12,548 --> 00:13:14,048
你真的是她的朋友吗？
Is it true you were her friend?

77
00:13:14,548 --> 00:13:15,548
什么？
What?

78
00:13:16,173 --> 00:13:17,173
抱歉，稍等一下。
Sorry, one sec.

79
00:13:19,506 --> 00:13:20,649
什么？
What?

80
00:13:20,673 --> 00:13:22,714
你真的是她的朋友吗？
Is it true you were her friend?

81
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,006
朋友？
Friend?

82
00:13:30,964 --> 00:13:31,964
是的。
Yes.

83
00:13:32,506 --> 00:13:34,881
我的意思是我确实认识她。
I mean, I did know her.

84
00:13:35,256 --> 00:13:36,256
不。
No.

85
00:13:37,423 --> 00:13:40,506
那就是我们的道路交叉了。
That is our path stayed cross.

86
00:13:52,506 --> 00:13:53,506
这很酷。
That's cool.

87
00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:01,340
但你必须明白，这已是很久以前的事了。
But you must understand, it was a long time ago.

88
00:14:53,632 --> 00:14:56,507
哦，我们为你感到骄傲。
Oh, we're so proud of you.

89
00:14:57,798 --> 00:14:58,858
我爱你。
I love you.

90
00:14:58,882 --> 00:15:00,507
请记住，这不是再见。
Just remember, it's not goodbye.

91
00:15:01,007 --> 00:15:01,298
告别。
Farewell.

92
00:15:01,632 --> 00:15:02,024
我们爱你。
We love you.

93
00:15:02,048 --> 00:15:02,816
得到你们全部的吻。
Have all your kiss.

94
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,108
是的。
Yes.

95
00:15:03,132 --> 00:15:03,899
然后你就会逃跑。
And you will run.

96
00:15:03,923 --> 00:15:04,132
是的。
Yes.

97
00:15:04,673 --> 00:15:05,132
我爱你。
I love you.

98
00:15:05,382 --> 00:15:06,382
这是悲伤的时刻。
It's sad time.

99
00:15:06,715 --> 00:15:07,858
已经想念你了。
Miss you already.

100
00:15:07,882 --> 00:15:08,882
冰棍使船无聊。
Popsicle bored the boat.

101
00:15:10,507 --> 00:15:11,507
我真的很爱你。
I love you so much.

102
00:15:12,132 --> 00:15:13,465
我的父母甚至不知道我离开了。
My parents don't even know I left.

103
00:15:17,715 --> 00:15:18,715
我是巴克。
I'm Buck.

104
00:15:19,674 --> 00:15:20,674
我来自芒奇金土地。
I'm from Munchkin lands.

105
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,174
我知道我们还不太了解彼此。
I know we don't really know each other yet.

106
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,465
你知道我相信维克。
You know I believe Vic.

107
00:15:26,924 --> 00:15:27,525
是维克。
It's Vic.

108
00:15:27,549 --> 00:15:28,549
是巴克。
It's Buck.

109
00:15:29,049 --> 00:15:30,049
那是陌生人。
That's strangers.

110
00:15:31,007 --> 00:15:32,367
他们只是我从未见过的人。
They're just people I've never met.

111
00:15:36,632 --> 00:15:37,632
再见。
Bye.

112
00:16:25,632 --> 00:16:26,632
噢，我的天啊。
Oh, my gosh.

113
00:16:27,507 --> 00:16:27,733
什么？
What?

114
00:16:27,757 --> 00:16:29,132
你在看什麼？
What are you staring at?

115
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:32,289
我的牙齿里有东西吗？
Do I have something in my teeth?

116
00:16:33,174 --> 00:16:34,174
不，只是...
No, it's just...

117
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:36,799
你是绿色的。
You're green.

118
00:16:39,091 --> 00:16:40,091
我是。
I am.

119
00:16:46,966 --> 00:16:47,174
美好的。
Fine.

120
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:48,924
让我们把这件事解决掉吧。
Let's get this over with.

121
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,091
不，我没有晕船。
No, I am not seasick.

122
00:16:51,508 --> 00:16:54,341
不，我小时候不吃草。
No, I did not eat grass as a child.

123
00:16:55,008 --> 00:16:57,508
是的，我一直都是绿色的。
And yes, I've always been green.

124
00:16:59,591 --> 00:17:04,508
嗯，我很遗憾你
Well, I for one am so sorry that you

125
00:17:04,883 --> 00:17:09,716
被迫忍受这种状况。
have been forced to live with this.

126
00:17:10,424 --> 00:17:11,525
是这样吗？
Is that so?

127
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:12,549
是的。
Yes.

128
00:17:14,508 --> 00:17:17,258
我打算主修魔法学。
And it is my intention to major in sorcery.

129
00:17:18,258 --> 00:17:24,133
因此，如果您在某个时候想要解决这个问题......
So if at some point you wanted to address the problem...

130
00:17:25,758 --> 00:17:26,758
问题？
Problem?

131
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,300
也许我可以帮忙。
Perhaps I could help.

132
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:31,716
她很抱歉。
She's so sorry.

133
00:17:31,966 --> 00:17:32,966
我爱你。
I love you.

134
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,800
好的。
All right.

135
00:17:42,633 --> 00:17:43,651
主动帮助别人
Offering to help someone

136
00:17:43,675 --> 00:17:45,401
你不知道什么技能
that you don't know what skills

137
00:17:45,425 --> 00:17:46,425
你没有的。
that you don't have.

138
00:17:47,508 --> 00:17:49,341
我确信每个人都对此印象深刻。
I'm sure everyone is duly impressed.

139
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:51,591
我不太在乎别人的想法。
I could care less what others think.

140
00:17:52,008 --> 00:17:52,383
你不能。
You couldn't.

141
00:17:52,716 --> 00:17:53,050
什么？
What?

142
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,883
你根本就不在乎别人怎么想。
You couldn't care less what other people think.

143
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,091
尽管我对此表示怀疑。

144
00:18:00,091 --> 00:18:01,091
艾尔法巴。
Elphaba.

埃尔法巴，泡沫。

146
00:18:05,175 --> 00:18:06,776
这是我的妹妹，Nessa Rose。
This is my younger sister, Nessa Rose.

147
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,800
正如您所见，她的肤色非常完美。
As you can see, she's a perfectly acceptable color.

148
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:14,175
别再出丑了。
Stop making a speck of yourself.

149
00:18:15,675 --> 00:18:16,776
我尽力表现得友善。

150

非常美好。

151
00:18:17,925 --> 00:18:18,984
那这是怎么回事呢？
And how did that come across?

152
00:18:19,008 --> 00:18:19,175
不。
No.

153
00:18:19,675 --> 00:18:20,610
这是怎么回事？
How did that come across?

154
00:18:20,634 --> 00:18:22,133
我不知道这对于我们意味着什么。
I don't think how that's meant to us.

155
00:18:23,675 --> 00:18:24,717
我珍贵的小女孩。
My precious little girl.

156
00:18:25,217 --> 00:18:26,217
父亲。

一份离别礼物。

158
00:18:35,717 --> 00:18:37,258
妈妈的真鞋子。
Mother's true shoes.

159
00:18:38,258 --> 00:18:41,609
这样他们都能看到你有多美丽

160
00:18:41,633 --> 00:18:43,342
一直到你的脚趾。

161
00:18:44,425 --> 00:18:45,425

00:18:48,592 --> 00:18:49,884
让我把它们和你的盒子放在一起。

165
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,800
当然。

166
00:18:55,675 --> 00:18:57,195
我不该那样去侦察。
I shouldn't have scouted off like that.

167
00:18:58,634 --> 00:18:59,842
不，你不应该这么做。
No, you shouldn't have.

168
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:05,134
今天是你新生活的开始。

169

我会想念你。
I'll miss you.

173
00:19:16,134 --> 00:19:17,134
不，你不会的。
No, you won't.

174
00:19:17,925 --> 00:19:19,205
你将会过得非常愉快。

175
00:19:20,884 --> 00:19:28,884
别帮我。
Don't help me.

176
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:35,509
她会没事的。
She'll be fine.

177
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:37,467
你所有的鞋子，耶稣。

请向你的人民汇报。

179
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:48,967
我们应该回来。

和她一起去。
Go with her.

00:19:50,509 --> 00:19:51,527
什么？
What?

182
00:19:51,551 --> 00:19:52,818
直到她安全
Just until she's safely

183
00:19:52,842 --> 00:19:54,693
安顿在她自己的小大屁股里。

184
00:19:54,717 --> 00:19:56,092
她需要的一切。
Everything she needs.

185
00:19:56,801 --> 00:19:58,277
父亲，她现在孤身一人。
Father, she's on her own right now.

186
00:19:58,301 --> 00:19:59,485
别再喋喋不休了。

187
00:19:59,509 --> 00:20:01,009
只要按我说的做就行。

188
00:20:03,384 --> 00:20:05,134
如果她发生什么事。
If anything should happen to her.

189
00:20:05,926 --> 00:20:08,384
在国内，比赛是一件大事。
In country, a match is a big one.

190
00:20:08,634 --> 00:20:10,843
前两者中，只有百分之一排在第一位。
Only a percent of the first two are in the first place.

191
00:20:15,926 --> 00:20:18,343
感谢您对我们大学的贡献。
Thank you for your contribution to our university.

192
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,843
在我们其他教职人员中，
And rounding out the rest of our faculty,

193
00:20:22,134 --> 00:20:23,634
我们有两位学者，

在各自的领域中表现突出

197
00:20:34,009 --> 00:20:36,235
当然还有我们的

198

历史系主任纽曼博士。
history department, Dr. Newman.

199
00:20:40,676 --> 00:20:43,634
你知道，除了我们出色的巫师，
You know, except for our wonderful wizard,

200
00:20:44,218 --> 00:20:46,902
真正的魔法已经变得非常罕见，
true magic has become all too rare,

201
00:20:46,926 --> 00:20:50,486
这就是为什么我们很荣幸能有我们尊敬的
which is why we are privileged to have our esteemed

202
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,635
魔法学系主任，

00:20:53,676 --> 00:20:54,676
马尔伯勒夫人。

204
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,551
天哪，这真的很痛。

205
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,843
欢迎各位新生，

无论你是在学习

208
00:21:35,218 --> 00:21:37,968
法律、逻辑或语言，
law, logic, or linguification,

209
00:21:38,927 --> 00:21:42,093
我知道我代表我的同事们发言
I know I speak for my fellow faculty members

210
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,010
当我说，
when I say,

211
00:21:45,385 --> 00:21:47,927
“我们只抱有最大的希望
"We have nothing but the highest hopes

212
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,760
对你们中的一些人来说。”
for some of you."

213
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:56,010
现在，帕德尔小姐，请你
And now, Miss Puddle, if you please,

我是 Puddle 小姐，一名 SHIS 压力患者。
I am Miss Puddle, a SHIS-stress.

215
00:22:00,635 --> 00:22:02,653
这是你的宿舍名称
And these are your dormitory designations

216
00:22:02,677 --> 00:22:04,135
和你的出色作业。

马尔伯勒夫人，你好。

220
00:22:27,719 --> 00:22:29,719
这是关于房间分配的事。
And this is regarding room assignments.

221
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:31,528
哦，非常感谢，但是我已经

222
00:22:31,552 --> 00:22:32,992
已经被分配了一个私人座位。

223
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:35,465

224
00:22:36,052 --> 00:22:37,302
也许你还记得我的文章，

225
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,677
“魔杖，对我来说，它们有一个意义。”
"Magic Wands, Me They Have a Point."

226
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:43,677
嗯，亲爱的，我并不是每个学期都教授研讨课。
Well, dear, I don't teach my seminar every semester.

227
00:22:44,427 --> 00:22:47,260
当然，如果有非常特别的人来的话。
Of course, if someone very special were to come along.

228
00:22:48,844 --> 00:22:50,861
没错。这就是我想和你谈谈的原因。
Exactly. This is why I wanted to talk to you.

229
00:22:50,885 --> 00:22:53,094
嗯，保持联系。

230
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,510
你在那里。
There you are.

231
00:22:57,927 --> 00:22:59,261
是梅瑟-罗斯小姐吗？
Miss Messer-Rose, isn't it?

232
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:00,511
该轮到州长了。
The governor's your turn.

233
00:23:01,511 --> 00:23:05,177
你的美丽竟如此悲惨。
How tragically beautiful you are.

234
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:08,011
我非常荣幸...
It is such an honor to...

235
00:23:09,177 --> 00:23:11,927
我是另一个女儿。我美丽而又悲惨。

236
00:23:12,886 --> 00:23:14,719
另一个女儿？

237
00:23:15,636 --> 00:23:17,528
埃尔法巴，你在做什么？
Elphaba, what are you doing?

238
00:23:17,552 --> 00:23:19,677
艾尔法巴，发生什么事了？去哪儿了？
Elphaba, what's the matter? Where?

239
00:23:20,761 --> 00:23:21,862
我知道。我只是……
I know. I was just...

240
00:23:21,886 --> 00:23:24,511
不算威胁，只是轻轻吞咽了一下。
Not a threat. Just a slight gulp.

241
00:23:26,552 --> 00:23:28,594
我们会找个地方把你藏起来。
We'll find a place to hide you.

242
00:23:28,927 --> 00:23:30,927
我是说，你怎么样了？
I mean, how's you?

243
00:23:32,594 --> 00:23:35,094
那没有必要。我还没排队。
That won't be necessary. I'm not in a row.

244
00:23:35,427 --> 00:23:36,427
噢，很好。
Oh, good.

245
00:23:37,178 --> 00:23:38,195
你为何还在这里？
Why are you still here?

246
00:23:38,219 --> 00:23:39,654
我很抱歉，正如父亲所坚持的那样......
I'm sorry, and as the father insisted...

247
00:23:39,678 --> 00:23:40,820
哦，州长做出了他的
Oh, the governor made his

248
00:23:40,844 --> 00:23:42,511
对你姐姐的关心相当明显。
concern for your sister quite apparent.

249
00:23:42,844 --> 00:23:45,487
请向他保证，我很荣幸能够帮助她。

250
00:23:45,511 --> 00:23:47,237
嗯，她不需要你的帮助。
Well, she doesn't need your help.

251
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:49,029
停下来。我只需要找到我的房间。
Stop. I just need to find my room.

252
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:50,529
妈妈，我会带你去那里。
I'll bring you there, Mom.

253
00:23:50,553 --> 00:23:54,678
科尔顿小姐，我向父亲保证我会……
Miss Colton, I promise my father that I will...

254
00:23:55,719 --> 00:23:56,719
停下来，科尔顿小姐。
Stop, Miss Colton.

255
00:23:57,344 --> 00:23:58,344
她是一位好妈妈。
She's a good mom.

256
00:23:58,803 --> 00:23:59,923
拜托，你不明白。
Please, you don't understand.

257
00:24:00,594 --> 00:24:01,594
停止！
Stop!

258
00:24:02,344 --> 00:24:03,344
让她走！
Let her go!

259
00:24:41,345 --> 00:24:43,636
这是我的机会。我的新儿子。
This is my chance. My new son.

260
00:24:44,553 --> 00:24:46,303
对不起，奈莎。我只是……
I'm sorry, Nessa. I just...

261
00:24:47,928 --> 00:24:49,112
我不...
I don't...

262
00:24:49,136 --> 00:24:52,487
魔法只是心灵的尝试
Magic is merely the mind's attempt

263
00:24:52,511 --> 00:24:56,011
将自己包裹在不可能的事情之中。
to wrap itself around the impossible.

264
00:24:57,136 --> 00:24:59,886
是的，那就是我。

265
00:25:02,137 --> 00:25:07,803
让您做好准备迎接 Shiz 的意外情况。
To prepare you to expect the unexpected here at Shiz.

266
00:25:15,512 --> 00:25:16,512
你真的看到了嗎？
Did you really see that?

267
00:25:17,053 --> 00:25:18,573
我必须要钻进她儿子的门下。
I simply must get under her son's door.

268
00:25:19,137 --> 00:25:22,428
说到意想不到的事情。
And speaking of the unexpected.

269
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:33,404
你们当中谁愿意与我们合住一个房间？
Which of you would volunteer to share a room?

270
00:25:33,428 --> 00:25:35,678
噢，我的太平间。
Oh, my morgue.

271
00:25:37,178 --> 00:25:40,262
谢谢你，亲爱的。你真是太好了。
Thank you, dear. That is very good of you.

272
00:25:40,845 --> 00:25:41,845
什么？
What?

273
00:25:42,304 --> 00:25:43,530
埃尔法巴小姐。
Miss Elphaba.

274
00:25:43,554 --> 00:25:44,554
艾尔法巴。
Elphaba.

275
00:25:47,637 --> 00:25:48,637
艾尔法巴。

00:25:51,095 --> 00:25:52,637
您可以和 Galinda 小姐同住。
You can room with Miss Galinda.

277
00:25:52,887 --> 00:25:54,113
啥？啥？我……
What? What? I...

278
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:57,220
现在，走吧。你们都走吧。
Now, go. All of you, go.

279
00:25:59,845 --> 00:26:00,845
去？
Go?

280
00:26:01,637 --> 00:26:02,637
你呢。
And you.

281
00:26:03,887 --> 00:26:04,887

283
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,220
不是你。
Not you.

00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,220
你。
You.

285

我想私下教你
I would like to teach you privately

286
00:26:23,512 --> 00:26:25,512
并且不接收其他学生。
and take no other students.

287
00:26:26,512 --> 00:26:27,512
谢谢你，我的儿子。
Thank you, my son.

288
00:26:30,887 --> 00:26:31,887
发生了什么？
What happened?

289
00:26:32,512 --> 00:26:34,262
事情非常不对劲。
Something is very wrong.

290
00:26:35,012 --> 00:26:36,054
我没有得偿所愿。
I didn't get my way.

291
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,262
我需要躺下。
I need to lie down.

292
00:26:38,762 --> 00:26:39,905
我需要躺下。
I need to lie down.

293
00:26:39,929 --> 00:26:41,054
快过来。快过来。
Get over here. Get over here.

294
00:26:41,512 --> 00:26:42,929
你需要喝一大杯。
You need a big drink.

295
00:26:44,387 --> 00:26:46,262
谢谢你替我掩护。
Thank you for covering for me.

296
00:26:46,512 --> 00:26:48,554
我对您的慷慨提议深感荣幸。
And I'm humbled by your magnificent offer.

297
00:26:49,012 --> 00:26:50,613
但我的父亲绝不会允许。
But my father would never allow it.

298
00:26:50,637 --> 00:26:51,679
把你的父亲交给我吧。
Leave your father to me.

299
00:26:52,012 --> 00:26:53,304
我会立即让你高兴起来。
I'll sweet you in immediately.

300
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:58,262
那么，您拥有这种天赋多久了？
So, how long have you had this talent?

301
00:26:59,637 --> 00:27:00,054
我不知道。
I don't know.

302
00:27:00,512 --> 00:27:01,512
不。
No.

303
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:04,054
有些事只是……
Something just...

304
00:27:05,554 --> 00:27:07,013
有一些东西控制了我。
Something just takes over me.

305
00:27:07,304 --> 00:27:09,763
有些事我无法控制。
And something I can't control.

306
00:27:11,054 --> 00:27:13,471
但一旦发生这种情况，就会发生糟糕的事情。
But when it does, bad things happen.

307
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:25,929
如果你能学会正确使用你的力量，
If you can learn to use your powers in the right way,

308
00:27:26,346 --> 00:27:28,471
哦，想念字母表，
oh, Miss Alfaba,

309
00:27:29,971 --> 00:27:32,655
我等待了很多年
many years I have waited for

310
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:35,096
像您这样的礼物出现。
a gift like yours to appear.

311
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:38,405
为什么，我预测巫师可能会
Why, I predict the wizard might

312
00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:42,864
让你成为他的魔法大帕齐尔。
make you his magic grand-pazier.

313
00:27:42,888 --> 00:27:43,888
巫师？
The wizard?

314
00:27:44,388 --> 00:27:49,263
亲爱的，亲爱的，我会马上写信给巫师。
My dear, my dear, I'll write at once to the wizard.

315
00:27:50,513 --> 00:27:53,055
提前告诉他你的情况。
Tell him of you in advance.

316
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:58,513
亲爱的，像你这样的才华，是有一个定义的。
With a talent like yours, dear, there is a definition.

317
00:27:59,638 --> 00:28:03,221
如果你按应有的方式工作，
If you work as you should,

318
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:09,096
你会做得很好。
you'll be making good.

319
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:14,513
欢迎来到 Shin。
Welcome to Shin.

320
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:19,096
课堂上见。
See you in class.

321
00:28:22,471 --> 00:28:27,513
那件事真的发生了吗？
Did that really just happen?

322
00:28:28,472 --> 00:28:33,489
我真的理解了这个奇怪的
Have I actually understood this weird

323
00:28:33,513 --> 00:28:37,138
我曾试图抑制或隐藏的怪癖？
quirk I've tried to suppress or hide?

324
00:28:38,013 --> 00:28:42,448
天赋能帮助我吗
Is it talent that could help me

325
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:49,138
如果我做得好，会不会成为向导？
make the wizard if I make good?

326
00:28:52,513 --> 00:28:57,347
所以我会做好事。
So I'll make good.

327
00:29:02,847 --> 00:29:07,722
当我遇见巫师，一旦我证明了我的价值，
When I meet the wizard, once I prove my worth,

328
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:11,948
然后我遇到了巫师什么
then I meet the wizard what

329
00:29:11,972 --> 00:29:14,180
我从出生就一直在等待。
I've waited for since birth.

330
00:29:14,514 --> 00:29:17,722
凭借他所有的魔法智慧，
And with all his wizard wisdom,

331
00:29:18,472 --> 00:29:21,055
从我的外表来看他不会被蒙蔽。
by my looks he won't be blinded.

332
00:29:21,764 --> 00:29:24,389
您认为巫师已经完成吗？
Do you think the wizard is done?

333
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:27,805
我所能咀嚼的一切都是如此迟钝。
All I can munch is so slow-minded.

334
00:29:28,305 --> 00:29:31,764
现在，他会对我说：“我知道你的真面目了。
Now, he'll say to me, "I see who you truly are.

335
00:29:32,097 --> 00:29:34,222
一个我可以信赖的女孩。”
A girl whom I can rely."

336
00:29:35,139 --> 00:29:40,014
这就是我和巫师的开始。
And that's how I'll begin the wizard and I.

337
00:29:45,472 --> 00:29:51,514
自从我和巫师在一起后，我的整个生活都会改变。
Since I'm with the wizard, my whole life will change.

338
00:29:52,597 --> 00:29:54,740
因为一旦你和
Because once you're with the

339
00:29:54,764 --> 00:29:57,806
巫师，没有人认为你很奇怪。
wizard, no one thinks you're strange.

340
00:29:58,181 --> 00:30:01,222
没有一个父亲不为你感到骄傲。
No father is not proud of you.

341
00:30:01,597 --> 00:30:04,722
没有姐妹会感到羞耻。
No sister acts ashamed.

342
00:30:05,556 --> 00:30:08,365
我们所有人都会爱你。
And all of us has to love you.

343
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,472
然后由巫师回收。
And by the wizard you reclaim.

344
00:30:11,472 --> 00:30:15,448
我内心的天赋或诅咒，
And this gift or this curse I have inside,

345
00:30:15,472 --> 00:30:21,032
也许最后当我们并肩工作时我才会知道原因。
maybe last I'll know why as we work head in hand.

346
00:30:21,056 --> 00:30:24,806
巫师和我。
The wizard and I.

347
00:30:25,472 --> 00:30:27,115
有一天他会对我说，
And one day he'll say to me,

348
00:30:27,139 --> 00:30:31,514
“Alphaba，一个如此优越的女孩。
"Alphaba, a girl who is so superior.

349
00:30:32,306 --> 00:30:34,282
这么好的女孩不应该
Shouldn't a girl who's so good

350
00:30:34,306 --> 00:30:37,449
里面有匹配的外部吗？
inside have a matching exterior?

351
00:30:37,473 --> 00:30:41,449
由于人们已经到了荒谬的程度，
And since folks are to an absurd degree,

352
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:44,074
说你会信守承诺
say you'll fix it on your word

353
00:30:44,098 --> 00:30:48,056
学位，你可以接受吗？
degree, would it be all right by you?

354
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:55,490
如果我被你录取了，我知道
If I'm degree-in-the-by you, I know

355
00:30:55,514 --> 00:30:57,889
对我来说并不重要的诅咒。”
a curse that's not important to me."

356
00:30:58,223 --> 00:30:59,223
好吧，为什么不呢？
All right, why not?

357
00:30:59,473 --> 00:31:06,806
我会重新申请，哦，我和巫师将是一对多么好的搭档啊。
I'll reapply, oh, what a pair will be the wizard and I.

358
00:31:08,223 --> 00:31:12,223
是的，巫师和……会是怎样的一对呢？
Yes, what a pair will be the wizard and...

359
00:31:24,723 --> 00:31:31,890
无限，我的未来无限。
Unlimited, my future is unlimited.

360
00:31:33,473 --> 00:31:37,098
我刚刚看到了一个几乎像预言一样的景象。
And I've just had a vision almost like a prophecy.

361
00:31:38,515 --> 00:31:44,348
我知道这听起来确实很疯狂但却是事实。
I know it sounds truly crazy and true.

362
00:31:44,806 --> 00:31:48,991
眼前的景象很模糊，但我发誓有一天
The vision's hazy, but I swear someday

363
00:31:49,015 --> 00:31:54,098
我们各地都会欢庆一番。
there'll be a celebration throughout us.

364
00:32:24,473 --> 00:32:29,515
我再也没有什么话能如此崇高地表达我的敬意了。
And nothing else can I tell in such high esteem.

365
00:32:31,473 --> 00:32:34,598
当人们看到我时他们会尖叫，
When people see me they will scream,

366
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:38,182
他们最喜欢的茶有一半是
for half of all their favorite tea.

367
00:32:43,515 --> 00:32:49,890
巫师和我。
The wizard and I.

368
00:33:22,724 --> 00:33:23,724
进来。
Come in.

369
00:33:30,474 --> 00:33:32,599
我行李中的其他物品应该很快就会到达。
The rest of my bag should be arriving shortly.

370
00:33:34,932 --> 00:33:38,516
你真的认为这公平吗？
Do you really think this is fair?

371
00:33:39,224 --> 00:33:42,932
哦，我不知道。他们答应给我一间私人套房。
Oh, I do not. I was promised a private suite.

372
00:33:43,932 --> 00:33:45,057
但感谢您的询问。
But thanks for asking.

373
00:33:49,807 --> 00:33:52,075
哪一个？我只是……我
Which one? I was just... I

374
00:33:52,099 --> 00:33:54,016
正要关门。
was just gonna close the door.

375
00:33:56,641 --> 00:33:58,533
哦，那你能不这么做吗？我
Oh, well, could you not? I'm

376
00:33:58,557 --> 00:34:00,849
抱歉。我只是……我很喜欢空气。
sorry. I just... I so enjoy air.

377
00:34:02,724 --> 00:34:05,224
你知道我的意思？
You know what I mean?

378
00:34:07,016 --> 00:34:11,849
哦，顺便说一句，我为你节省了一些空间。
Oh, I saved you some space, by the way.

379
00:34:13,974 --> 00:34:17,224
就在这儿。就在这里。
Here it is. Just in here.

380
00:34:28,474 --> 00:34:29,599
这很棒。
It's great.

381
00:34:33,266 --> 00:34:34,266
没什么。
It was nothing.

382
00:34:34,933 --> 00:34:36,117
室友们做这些事是为了
Roommates do these things for

383
00:34:36,141 --> 00:34:38,391
彼此。我被告知如此。
each other. So I've been told.

384
00:34:43,641 --> 00:34:47,600
作为回报，也许你可以，让我们看看，
And in return, perhaps you could, let's see,

385
00:34:48,183 --> 00:34:51,058
帮我在莫里布尔夫人面前说几句好话？成交？
put in a good word for me with Madame Morrible? Deal?

386
00:34:54,475 --> 00:34:55,617
正是你在那里
That was you down there who made

387
00:34:55,641 --> 00:34:57,600
发生的一切。我知道是这样的。
all that happen. I know it was.

388
00:34:58,308 --> 00:34:59,348
你听过莫里布尔夫人吗？
You heard Madame Morrible?

389
00:35:03,516 --> 00:35:07,141
你是怎么做到的？请告诉我。我可以保证它安全。
How did you do it? Tell me, please. I can keep it safe.

390
00:35:09,475 --> 00:35:12,867
有趣。就是这样。但真的
Fun. Be that way. But it really

391
00:35:12,891 --> 00:35:14,225
这对你们来说相当自私。
is rather selfish on your part.

392
00:35:14,516 --> 00:35:15,202
你知道，我问的是
You know, I asked really

393
00:35:15,226 --> 00:35:17,076
很好，我帮你避免了冷战。
nicely and I saved you the cold war.

394
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,180
我不知道。我永远都不知道。
I don't know. I never know.

395
00:35:29,058 --> 00:35:31,267
好了。享受空气吧。
There. Enjoy the air.

396
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,558
最亲爱的宝贝是妈妈和冰棒。
Dearest darling is Momsie and Popsicle.

397
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:43,267
我亲爱的父亲，感谢您同意让我留下来。
My dear father, thank you for agreeing to let me stay.

398
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,201
猜猜怎么着？关于我们的
Guess what? In regards to our

399
00:35:46,225 --> 00:35:48,517
要求我和 Nessa 一起行动。
request that I'm moving with Nessa.

400
00:35:48,975 --> 00:35:55,683
我听不到你的猜测，因为这是一封信。
I can't hear your guesses because this is a letter.

401
00:35:56,475 --> 00:35:59,183
我知道她多么想成为这样的人。
I know how much she wants to be.

402
00:36:02,975 --> 00:36:04,142
所以我只会告诉你。
So I'll just tell you.

403
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:09,725
在 Shis 这里漫游时出现了一些混乱。
There's been some confusion over roaming here at Shis.

404
00:36:10,017 --> 00:36:12,100
但我当然会照顾 Nessa。
But of course I'll care for Nessa.

405
00:36:12,642 --> 00:36:15,892
但我的生活当然很麻烦。
But of course my life's a bother.

406
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:19,975
因为我知道这就是你希望我做出的回应。
For I know that's how you'd want me to respond.

407
00:36:20,684 --> 00:36:21,684
是的。
Yes.

408
00:36:22,725 --> 00:36:26,892
你遇到了一些困惑，看看我的遗体吧。
There's been some confusion for you, see my remains.

409
00:36:30,184 --> 00:36:34,785
异常而又奇特，
Unusually and exceedingly peculiar and

410
00:36:34,809 --> 00:36:39,725
完全无法描述。
altogether quite impossible to describe.

411
00:36:42,475 --> 00:36:43,475
金发女郎。
Blonde.

412
00:36:45,475 --> 00:36:53,475
为什么会有这种突然而又新鲜的感觉？
What is this feeling so sudden and new?

413
00:36:55,101 --> 00:36:57,684
当我第一眼看见你时，我就有这样的感觉。
I felt the moment I laid eyes on you.

414
00:36:58,184 --> 00:36:59,267
我的脉搏跳动得很急。
My pulse is rushing.

415
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:00,993
我头晕目眩。
My head is reeling.

416
00:37:01,017 --> 00:37:02,601
是的，我的脸红了。
Yes well, my face is flushing.

417
00:37:03,101 --> 00:37:06,892
这是什么感觉？痛苦的害虫？
What is this feeling, the vermin of the pain?

418
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:09,726
它有名字吗？
Does it have a name?

419
00:37:10,517 --> 00:37:13,434
是的。
Yes.

420
00:37:17,601 --> 00:37:20,892
服装。掺假的装扮。
Clothing. An adulterated loading.

421
00:37:21,517 --> 00:37:22,785
为了你的脸。
For your face.

422
00:37:22,809 --> 00:37:24,017
为了你的衣服。
For your clothing.

423
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:27,809
就这么说吧，我喜欢这一切。
Let's just say, I love it all.

424
00:37:28,892 --> 00:37:31,785
每一个小技巧，无论多小，
Every little trick, however small,

425
00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:34,452
让我的肉体开始爬行。
makes my very flesh begin to crawl.

426
00:37:34,476 --> 00:37:38,577
简单的水收费，有一个奇怪的
The simple water tolling, there's a strange

427
00:37:38,601 --> 00:37:42,934
在如此彻底的厌恶中感到兴奋。
exhilaration in such total detestation.

428
00:37:44,101 --> 00:37:47,518
它是如此纯粹，如此强烈。
It's so pure, so strong.

429
00:37:48,018 --> 00:37:51,119
我知道它来得很快，所以
I know that it came on fast, so

430
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:53,601
我确实相信它能够持续下去。
I do believe that it can last.

431
00:37:54,184 --> 00:38:00,643
我会拥抱你，爱你一辈子。
And I will be holding, loving you my whole life.

432
00:38:01,518 --> 00:38:03,893
亲爱的 Galinda，你太棒了。
Dear Galinda, you are just too good.

433
00:38:04,768 --> 00:38:07,101
怎么说呢，我觉得我不太好？
How do you say that I don't think I'm good?

434
00:38:07,434 --> 00:38:09,160
她是一个恐怖分子，她是一个鞑靼人。
She's a terror, she's a tartar.

435
00:38:09,184 --> 00:38:10,619
我们都需要向一个男人展示你
We all need to show a guy you

436
00:38:10,643 --> 00:38:12,393
被击中，加林达，你是一位烈士。
struck, Galinda, you're a martyr.

437
00:38:12,935 --> 00:38:18,393
嗯，这些东西我好像都尝试过了。
Well, these things I seem to try.

438
00:38:20,476 --> 00:38:21,476
哦。
Oh.

439
00:38:28,476 --> 00:38:31,726
你的加林达强迫你居住，
Your Galinda forced you to reside,

440
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,810
和一个如此令人厌恶又如此优秀的人在一起。
with someone so disgusting and fine.

441
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:39,768
我们只是想告诉你，我们都站在你这边。
We just want to tell you, we're all on your side.

442
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,994
我们分享你的身体。
We share your body.

443
00:38:42,018 --> 00:38:44,327
这种感觉怎么这么突然、这么新鲜？
What is this feeling, so sudden and new?

444
00:38:44,351 --> 00:38:46,452
我害怕那一刻，我会对你撒谎。
I'm afraid of the moment, I lay lies on you.

445
00:38:46,476 --> 00:38:49,310
我害怕那一刻，我总是匆匆而过。
I'm afraid of the moment, I'm always rushing.

446
00:38:49,685 --> 00:38:52,577
我有一种感觉，我们喜欢这一切。
I had a feeling, we love it all.

447
00:38:52,601 --> 00:38:54,018
噢，这是什麼感觉？
Oh, what is this feeling?

448
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:58,828
现在，每件小事都很奇怪。
Now, every small thing's a very strange.

449
00:38:58,852 --> 00:38:59,852
是的。
Yes.

450
00:39:01,852 --> 00:39:06,369
哦，亲爱的，亲爱的，有一种奇怪的
Oh, loving, loving, there's a strange

451
00:39:06,393 --> 00:39:10,602
在如此彻底的厌恶中感到兴奋。
exhilaration in such total detestation.

452
00:39:11,518 --> 00:39:13,935
它是如此纯粹，如此强烈。
It's so pure, it's so strong.

453
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:15,518
好强啊。
So strong.

454
00:39:15,977 --> 00:39:18,018
太棒了，太快了。
It's so good, it's so fast.

455
00:39:18,893 --> 00:39:20,268
但我还是不相信。
Still, I don't believe it.

456
00:39:20,518 --> 00:39:21,518
太快了。
It's so fast.

457
00:39:21,935 --> 00:39:24,119
这样我就不会讨厌你了。
And then I won't be loathing you.

458
00:39:24,143 --> 00:39:26,119
为了你，为了你，为了你，为了你。
For you, for you, for you, for you.

459
00:39:26,143 --> 00:39:32,227
厌恶，请厌恶你。
Loathing, please, loathing you.

460
00:39:34,018 --> 00:39:35,269
我的一生。
My whole life.

461
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:39,144
厌恶，你还没有那么，那么，那么做好准备，厌恶。
Loathing, you're not so, so, so ready, loathing.

462
00:40:05,644 --> 00:40:07,953
好啦好啦，大家安静一下
All right, all right, everyone, settle

463
00:40:07,977 --> 00:40:10,560
女士们，先生们，请安静下来。
down, ladies and gentlemen, settle down.

464
00:40:11,019 --> 00:40:12,435
安静，大家安静。
Quiet, quiet, everyone.

465
00:40:13,685 --> 00:40:17,186
现在，我读了你最近的文章，
Now then, I have read your most recent essays,

466
00:40:17,727 --> 00:40:21,102
我很惊讶地报告了一些进展，
and I am amazed to report some progress,

467
00:40:21,477 --> 00:40:23,620
尽管我们中的一些人仍然倾向于
although some of us still tend to

468
00:40:23,644 --> 00:40:26,269
形式比内容更重要，琳达小姐。
favor form over content, Miss Linda.

469
00:40:28,144 --> 00:40:31,811
哦，实际上，应该是“Guh, Linda”，带一个“Guh”。
Oh, actually, it's "Guh, Linda," with a "Guh."

470
00:40:32,477 --> 00:40:35,102
是的当然。
Yes, of course.

471
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:41,537
我不认为问题是，你知道，其他
I don't see that the problem is, you know, every other

472
00:40:41,561 --> 00:40:43,852
教授成功地发出了我的名字的音。
professor manages to pronounceify my name.

473
00:40:44,561 --> 00:40:47,203
也许你珍贵的名字的发音不是
Maybe the pronunciation of your precious name is not

474
00:40:47,227 --> 00:40:49,269
迪利曼博士生活的唯一重心。
the sole focus of Dr. Dilliman's life.

475
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:52,186
也许迪利曼博士和其他教授不一样。
Maybe Dr. Dilliman is not like every other professor.

476
00:40:53,061 --> 00:40:55,227
或许我们中的一些人就是与众不同。
Maybe some of us are just different.

477
00:40:56,936 --> 00:40:59,936
嗯，看来洋蓟是蒸的。
Well, it seems the artichoke is steamed.

478
00:41:04,478 --> 00:41:06,894
请保持安静。
Quiet, please, please.

479
00:41:07,853 --> 00:41:11,103
是的，我们的上门牙松弛了，
Yes, we go slack upper front teeth,

480
00:41:11,478 --> 00:41:14,686
这解释了为什么发音错误，格林达小姐。
which accounts for the mispronunciation, Miss Glinda.

481
00:41:17,978 --> 00:41:22,061
你看，我们中的一些人确实有所不同。
You see, indeed, some of us are different.

482
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:26,787
现在，你可能已经注意到，我是最后
Now, you may have noticed that I am one of the last

483
00:41:26,811 --> 00:41:29,019
Shill's 的动物教授们，
animal professors here at Shill's,

484
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:33,370
我们不鼓励在课堂上讨论这个问题，
and it isn't encouraged to discuss this in our classes,

485
00:41:33,394 --> 00:41:36,745
但我们的整个历史中发生了一些重大变化
but there have been some great changes throughout ours

486
00:41:36,769 --> 00:41:39,186
拒绝动物文化。
with the rejection of animal culture.

487
00:41:40,478 --> 00:41:44,329
然而在你出生之前有一段时间
However, there was a time before you were born when

488
00:41:44,353 --> 00:41:46,353
我们的生活有所不同。
life in ours was different.

489
00:41:48,811 --> 00:41:50,579
当人们可以走在这些大厅里，
When one could walk these halls and

490
00:41:50,603 --> 00:41:53,145
听听雪豹如何解方程
hear a snow leopard salving an equation

491
00:41:53,478 --> 00:41:56,270
或一只羚羊阐释一首十四行诗，
or an antelope explicating a sonnet,

492
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:01,145
那么这种变化是何时、为何发生的？
so when and why did this change?

493
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,579
据我所知，这是一场大旱灾。
From what I've read, the great drought.

494
00:42:03,603 --> 00:42:03,811
是的。
Yeah.

495
00:42:04,478 --> 00:42:05,329
打扰一下。
Excuse me.

496
00:42:05,353 --> 00:42:06,353
就像举手一样。
Like raise your hand.

497
00:42:06,936 --> 00:42:08,520
恰恰。
Precisely.

498
00:42:09,228 --> 00:42:12,853
食物变得稀缺，当人们感到饥饿和愤怒时，
Food grew scarce, and when people are hungry and angry,

499
00:42:13,186 --> 00:42:14,603
好吧，然后他们开始寻找......
well, then they begin to look for...

500
00:42:14,936 --> 00:42:15,936
应该责怪某人。
Someone to blame.

501
00:42:17,436 --> 00:42:18,936
非常正确，埃尔法巴小姐。
Quite right, Miss Elphaba.

502
00:42:23,353 --> 00:42:25,103
是的，格林达小姐。
Yes, Miss Glinda.

503
00:42:25,478 --> 00:42:28,312
那是“格，格林达。”
It is "Guh, Glinda."

504
00:42:28,603 --> 00:42:29,603
“呃，格林达。”
"Guh, Glinda."

505
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:30,830
“呃，格林达。”
"Guh, Glinda."

506
00:42:30,854 --> 00:42:32,913
我不明白为什么你不能只教我们历史。
And I don't see why you can't just teach us history.

507
00:42:32,937 --> 00:42:35,020
相反，我总是喋喋不休地谈论过去。
Instead, I'm always harping on the past.

508
00:42:35,812 --> 00:42:38,437
因为我们无法逃避过去，
Because we cannot escape the past,

509
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:41,270
如果我们忽视它，后果将不堪设想。
and we ignore it at our own peril.

510
00:42:42,645 --> 00:42:45,187
过去有助于解释我们当前的状况。
The past helps explain our present circumstances.

511
00:42:45,812 --> 00:42:48,853
例如，如果我们检查这个时间线……
For instance, if we examine this timeline...

512
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:07,104
谁应该对此负责？
Who is responsible for this?

513
00:43:13,687 --> 00:43:17,312
请问，这事谁该负责？
I ask, who is responsible for this?

514
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:22,456
非常好。
Very well.

515
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,187
下课了。
Class dismissed.

516
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:28,604
我说，下课啦！
I said, class dismissed!

517
00:43:40,479 --> 00:43:41,479
德里姆博士。
Dr. Derrym.

518
00:43:42,645 --> 00:43:43,645
埃尔法巴小姐。
Miss Elphaba.

519
00:43:47,021 --> 00:43:48,521
埃尔法巴小姐，你不必……
Miss Elphaba, you don't have to...

520
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:53,104
谢谢。你太客气了。
Thank you. You're very kind.

521
00:44:00,479 --> 00:44:01,729
不错。
Not bad.

522
00:44:07,646 --> 00:44:08,646
我最喜欢的是 Poppy。
Poppy's all my favorite.

523
00:44:09,812 --> 00:44:10,812
我也是。
Mine too.

524
00:44:12,229 --> 00:44:14,479
他们让我在这些黑暗的日子里保持快乐。
They keep me cheerful in these dark times.

525
00:44:15,479 --> 00:44:20,437
艾尔法巴小姐，请你去和你的朋友们会合吧。
Miss Elphaba, please. Go and join your friends.

526
00:44:20,854 --> 00:44:22,454
没关系。我没有朋友。
It's all right. I don't have any friends.

527
00:44:23,271 --> 00:44:25,479
嗯，也许有一个。
Well, maybe one.

528
00:44:37,479 --> 00:44:42,021
再试一次。
Try again.

529
00:44:44,813 --> 00:44:45,813
閉上眼睛。
Eyes shut.

530
00:44:47,063 --> 00:44:48,063
脚趾紧握。
Toes clenched.

531
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:54,146
现在，让硬币悬浮起来。
Now, levitate the coin.

532
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,980
没关系。
It's all right.

533
00:45:35,271 --> 00:45:36,605
这需要时间。
It takes time.

534
00:45:44,938 --> 00:45:47,997
我听说有一个不幸的
I hear there was an unfortunate

535
00:45:48,021 --> 00:45:51,022
今天迪勒曼博士的课堂上发生了骚乱。
disturbance in Dr. Dillerman's class today.

536
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,355
那对你来说一定非常痛苦。
That must have been so distressful for you.

537
00:45:58,855 --> 00:46:01,373
嗯，有人写了这些
Well, someone wrote those

538
00:46:01,397 --> 00:46:05,688
故意让他看到可怕的话。
horrendous words on purpose for him to see.

539
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:10,230
我只是希望我可以......
I just wish I could...

540
00:46:10,522 --> 00:46:13,522
上帝，你想要什么？
God, you wish what?

541
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:15,665
我希望有
I wish there was something I

542
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:16,897
可以做到，因为没有人……
could do, because no one...

543
00:46:19,063 --> 00:46:20,063
没有人...
No one...

544
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:21,980
什么？
To what?

545
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:26,980
任何人都不应被蔑视，
No one should be scorned,

546
00:46:27,688 --> 00:46:29,647
或被人嘲笑，
or laughed at,

547
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,939
或被人瞧不起，或...
or looked down upon, or...

548
00:46:36,522 --> 00:46:37,939
被告知不要再喋喋不休，
told to stop jabbering,

549
00:46:38,855 --> 00:46:40,105
并继续奔跑。
and keep running.

550
00:46:46,772 --> 00:46:47,772
卓越。
Remarkable.

551
00:46:49,147 --> 00:46:50,564
这很快就会变得引人注目。
That will soon be remarkable.

552
00:46:53,064 --> 00:46:55,355
一旦你学会控制自己的情绪，
Once you learn to harness your emotion,

553
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:58,564
天空才是极限。
the sky's the limit.

554
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,730
它可以带你去见巫师本人。
It could lead you to the wizard himself.

555
00:47:09,772 --> 00:47:13,439
再见，迪勒曼博士。
Goodbye, Dr. Dillerman.

556
00:47:17,106 --> 00:47:21,272
迪勒曼博士！
Dr. Dillerman!

557
00:47:22,814 --> 00:47:23,814
你知道是谁吗...
Did you find out who...

558
00:47:29,231 --> 00:47:37,231
动物现在受到指责
The animals are now being blamed

559
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:40,606
对于所有出错的事情，
for everything that goes wrong,

560
00:47:41,189 --> 00:47:43,981
被迫辞职，并被告知保持沉默。
forced from our jobs, told to keep silent.

561
00:47:44,231 --> 00:47:45,623
这比
This is much bigger than

562
00:47:45,647 --> 00:47:47,522
只是黑板上的一些文字。
just some words on a chalkboard.

563
00:47:47,981 --> 00:47:50,856
我们仍然可以像我们一样私下交谈。
We can still converse in private, like ours.

564
00:47:51,397 --> 00:47:52,623
我的一个亲爱的朋友。
A dear friend of mine.

565
00:47:52,647 --> 00:47:53,106
亲爱的？
A dear?

566
00:47:53,481 --> 00:47:54,481
实际上是一头牛。
A cow, actually.

567
00:47:54,856 --> 00:47:56,481
她一直在抗议活动中发表讲话，
She's been speaking out at protests,

568
00:47:57,231 --> 00:47:59,648
最近我写信给我，约在咖啡馆见面。
recently wrote me asking to meet at a cafe.

569
00:48:00,648 --> 00:48:01,856
她说事情很紧急。
She said it was urgent.

570
00:48:02,314 --> 00:48:03,606
她告诉你什么了？
What did she tell you?

571
00:48:03,856 --> 00:48:06,398
她再也没有出现过，从那以后也没人见过她。
She never showed, and no one's seen her since.

572
00:48:06,731 --> 00:48:07,790
许多动物来了
Many animals have come

573
00:48:07,814 --> 00:48:09,939
缺失，或者实际上相信。
missing, or are actually believing.

574
00:48:10,481 --> 00:48:11,856
是的，他们有獾熟人，
Yes, they have badger acquaintance,

575
00:48:12,314 --> 00:48:16,148
一名律师仅因辩护此案就被解雇。
a solicitor was sacked just for arguing the case.

576
00:48:16,481 --> 00:48:18,290
至少他还能争辩。
At least he can still argue.

577
00:48:18,314 --> 00:48:19,314
你是什​​么意思？
What do you mean?

578
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:20,814
让我给你看一下。
Let me show you.

579
00:48:23,731 --> 00:48:26,207
我听说过一头牛，一位来自夸克的教授，
I've heard of an ox, a professor from Quarks,

580
00:48:26,231 --> 00:48:28,064
不再被允许教学，
no longer permitted to teach,

581
00:48:28,606 --> 00:48:30,731
失去了所有说话的能力。
who has lost all powers of speech.

582
00:48:31,564 --> 00:48:32,314
我不能说话。
I can't speak.

583
00:48:32,564 --> 00:48:34,398
一个小精灵正在咀嚼岩石，
And an hourling munched in rock,

584
00:48:35,231 --> 00:48:38,773
一个被禁止传教的兴旺发达的人物。
a figure with a thriving block forbidden to preach.

585
00:48:39,023 --> 00:48:39,606
不不。
No, no.

586
00:48:39,981 --> 00:48:41,731
现在我们只能尖叫。
Now we only can screech.

587
00:48:42,606 --> 00:48:46,315
虽然只是谣言，但足以让任何一个人知道过去。
Only rumors, but still enough to give past to anyone.

588
00:48:46,731 --> 00:48:51,023
回顾过去，我们身边发生了一些不好的事情。
With past, something bad is happening in ours.

589
00:48:52,481 --> 00:48:55,666
...发生了一些糟糕的事情...
Something bad is happening in...

590
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:56,148
就是这样！
That's it!

591
00:48:56,606 --> 00:48:58,082
我要离开我们，趁我还能
I'm leaving us, while I can

592
00:48:58,106 --> 00:48:59,356
仍说出再见这个词。
still speak the word goodbye.

593
00:48:59,731 --> 00:49:00,940
不可以！
No, you can't!

594
00:49:03,648 --> 00:49:04,666
把它拿走！
Take it away!

595
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:04,940
停止。
Stop.

596
00:49:05,648 --> 00:49:06,648
对不起。
Sorry.

597
00:49:08,523 --> 00:49:10,356
不不。
No, no.

598
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:11,874
有人从来不...
Someone's never...

599
00:49:11,898 --> 00:49:13,082
它是什么？
What is it?

600
00:49:13,106 --> 00:49:14,106
这是埃尔法巴。
This is Elphaba.

601
00:49:14,398 --> 00:49:15,398
你在这里干什么？
What are you doing here?

602
00:49:16,273 --> 00:49:17,273
嗯，我只是......
Well, I was just...

603
00:49:18,023 --> 00:49:19,023
没关系。
It's all right.

604
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:19,732
迅速地。
Quickly.

605
00:49:20,357 --> 00:49:21,357
進來。
Come inside.

606
00:49:31,315 --> 00:49:32,315
别害怕。
Don't be frightened.

607
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,440
我给你倒点茶吧。
Let me get you some tea.

608
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:39,190
德尔曼博士，您刚才说的话……
Dr. Delman, what you were saying just now...

609
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:41,690
这真的会发生吗？
Could that really happen?

610
00:49:43,148 --> 00:49:44,148
它正在发生。
It is happening.

611
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:47,499
你会发现如果你让它足够令人沮丧，
You'll find if you make it discouraging enough,

612
00:49:47,523 --> 00:49:50,982
你可以让任何人保持沉默。
you can keep anyone silent.

613
00:50:00,107 --> 00:50:02,357
但如果动物失去了说话的能力，
But if animals are losing the ability to speak,

614
00:50:03,315 --> 00:50:04,399
然后就离开我们了……
leaving us, then...

615
00:50:05,524 --> 00:50:07,000
必须有人去告诉巫师。
Someone's got to tell the wizard.

616
00:50:07,024 --> 00:50:08,166
听我说。
Listen to me.

617
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:09,416
你不能告诉别人
You mustn't tell another soul

618
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,800
您今晚在 Xenia 所听到的内容。
what you've heard in Xenia tonight.

619
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:12,565
但这就是我们拥有巫师的原因。
But that's why we have a wizard.

620
00:50:13,857 --> 00:50:15,440
所以没什么不好...
So nothing bad...

621
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:18,190
也许你是对的。
Perhaps you're right.

622
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:21,524
没什么那么糟糕的...
Nothing all that bad...

623
00:50:23,815 --> 00:50:25,315
没什么真正糟糕的事...
Nothing truly bad...

624
00:50:30,065 --> 00:50:31,065
对不起。
Sorry.

625
00:50:31,482 --> 00:50:32,482
坏的。
Bad.

626
00:50:33,857 --> 00:50:35,357
我肯定是感冒了。
I must be catching a cold.

627
00:50:39,774 --> 00:50:40,854
我会祝福您，德尔曼博士。
I'll bless you, Dr. Delman.

628
00:50:47,482 --> 00:50:48,732
你最好走吧。
You'd better go.

629
00:50:49,524 --> 00:50:50,524
小睡一会儿。
Take the nap.

630
00:51:07,482 --> 00:51:08,607
哇喔！
Whoa there!

631
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:09,149
伟大的！
Great!

632
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:10,566
哇哦！
Whoa!

633
00:51:11,024 --> 00:51:12,333
我没有看见她。
I did not see her.

634
00:51:12,357 --> 00:51:13,357
是的，我也没有。
Yeah, neither did I.

635
00:51:14,482 --> 00:51:16,441
你可能想要，嗯……
You might want to, um...

636
00:51:17,066 --> 00:51:17,168
好的。
Okay.

637
00:51:17,192 --> 00:51:18,316
不，不，不。
No, no, no.

638
00:51:19,274 --> 00:51:20,274
非常抱歉，小姐。
I'm so sorry, miss.

639
00:51:20,732 --> 00:51:21,500
我们没有在那儿看见你。
We didn't see you there.

640
00:51:21,524 --> 00:51:22,524
你一定有...
You must have...

641
00:51:24,274 --> 00:51:25,274
和树叶融为一体。
blended with the foliage.

642
00:51:26,108 --> 00:51:27,500
这就是你的生活方式吗？
Is this how you go with your life?

643
00:51:27,524 --> 00:51:29,644
只是跑过一个僧侣并践踏你路上的任何人？
Just running a monk and trampling anyone in your path?

644
00:51:30,649 --> 00:51:31,649
不。
No.

645
00:51:32,483 --> 00:51:33,625
不。
No.

646
00:51:33,649 --> 00:51:34,649
有时我睡着了。
Sometimes I'm asleep.

647
00:51:37,024 --> 00:51:39,066
好的。
All right.

648
00:51:40,483 --> 00:51:40,941
开始了。
Here we go.

649
00:51:41,274 --> 00:51:42,459
不，我没有晕船。
No, I'm not seasick.

650
00:51:42,483 --> 00:51:43,625
我也不是。
Neither am I.

651
00:51:43,649 --> 00:51:45,750
不，我小时候不吃草。
No, I did not eat grass as a child.

652
00:51:45,774 --> 00:51:46,668
你不介意吗？
You didn't mind it?

653
00:51:46,692 --> 00:51:49,191
是的，我一直都是绿色的。
And yes, I have always been green.

654
00:51:50,108 --> 00:51:52,148
那么防御性是最近才发展起来的吗？
And the defensiveness, is that a recent development?

655
00:52:08,483 --> 00:52:09,683
我准备进行更多的践踏。
I'm up for some more trampling.

656
00:52:09,941 --> 00:52:10,459
我们可以载您一程吗？
May we offer you a ride?

657
00:52:10,483 --> 00:52:11,667
不，谢谢。
No thanks.

658
00:52:11,691 --> 00:52:12,691
吃饱。
Get stuffed.

659
00:52:14,566 --> 00:52:15,566
哇。
Wow.

660
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:18,406
费尔斯维尔，我们刚刚被一个女孩激励了。
Felsville, we have just been spurred by a girl.

661
00:52:19,775 --> 00:52:20,775
的确。
Indeed.

662
00:52:21,066 --> 00:52:22,066
先亲吻，再做一切。
Kisses first, everything.

663
00:52:24,233 --> 00:52:25,275
同学们注意了。
Attention students.

664
00:52:25,858 --> 00:52:27,376
我很荣幸地宣布
It is my honor to announce that

665
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:30,126
菲耶罗王子和温基国的提格拉尔
Prince Fiero and Tigelar of Winky Country

666
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:32,566
将充实我们的学生队伍。
will be filling out our student body.

667
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:36,275
从皇家温基学院转学而来。
Having transfers from the Royal Winky Academy.

668
00:52:37,483 --> 00:52:39,483
请帮助他感受到欢迎。
Please help him feel welcome.

669
00:52:40,816 --> 00:52:42,483
不进行直接的目光接触。
Without making direct eye contact.

670
00:53:07,192 --> 00:53:09,942
我们都经常来这里吗？
And we're all here often?

671
00:53:11,067 --> 00:53:13,775
我能问你什么吗？
Could I ask you anything?

672
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:15,650
有什么想要的吗？
Anything you want?

673
00:53:16,233 --> 00:53:17,334
只是为了让开路。
Just to move out the way.

674
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:18,692
绝对是的。什么都行。
Absolutely, yeah. That's anything.

675
00:53:20,733 --> 00:53:21,733
你好吗？
How are you?

676
00:53:22,275 --> 00:53:23,275
是的。
Yeah.

677
00:53:26,275 --> 00:53:34,275
您在找什么吗？
Are you looking for something?

678
00:53:37,484 --> 00:53:40,234
或者？有人？
Or? Someone?

679
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:41,900
不，我当时...
No, I was...

680
00:53:45,317 --> 00:53:46,317
我知道吗？
Was I knowing?

681
00:53:47,817 --> 00:53:48,817
我怎么会知道？
How would I know?

682
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,400
我们的第一次飞行。
Our first flight.

683
00:53:58,484 --> 00:53:59,942
噢，还在。
Oh, still here.

684
00:54:00,234 --> 00:54:01,234
嗯嗯。
Mm-hmm.

685
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:03,626
嗯，我答应带你去参观
Well, I promised to give a guided tour

686
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:05,484
对于任何刚到的学生来说，所以......
to any recently arrived students, so...

687
00:54:06,484 --> 00:54:07,484
毫米。
Mm.

688
00:54:08,817 --> 00:54:09,817
等待。
Wait.

689
00:54:10,609 --> 00:54:12,484
您是刚到的学生吗？
Are you a recently arrived student?

690
00:54:13,192 --> 00:54:14,192
是的，是的。
I am, yeah.

691
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:15,651
哦，我不知道。
Oh, I didn't know.

692
00:54:16,192 --> 00:54:18,002
不，我不确定我是否能坚持更久
No, I'm not sure I'll last longer at

693
00:54:18,026 --> 00:54:19,386
比其他任何学校都更了解这所学校。
this school than any of the others.

694
00:54:20,776 --> 00:54:21,776
但...
But...

695
00:54:22,442 --> 00:54:23,922
我没去过你们的其他学校。
I wasn't at any of your other schools.

696
00:54:25,734 --> 00:54:26,734
唔。
Hmm.

697
00:54:54,484 --> 00:54:57,984
这里就是书店。
And this is the book place.

698
00:54:59,609 --> 00:55:01,502
这里收藏着一系列稀有
There's a collection of rare

699
00:55:01,526 --> 00:55:02,859
这儿某处有书。

700
00:55:03,484 --> 00:55:05,318
还有一些五分熟的。
And some medium rare as well.

701
00:55:06,026 --> 00:55:07,609
嗯，有很多可供选择。
Well, there's so many to choose from.

702
00:55:08,484 --> 00:55:09,484
正确的。
Right.

703
00:55:13,068 --> 00:55:21,068
那么你在这儿可以做些什么好玩的事呢？
So what do you do for fun around here?

704
00:55:25,151 --> 00:55:26,568
哦，好吧，没什么。
Oh, well, nothing.

705
00:55:27,568 --> 00:55:28,568
到目前为止。
Until now.

706
00:55:28,818 --> 00:55:30,298
您还没去过 Osterstahlung 吗？
You haven't been to the Osterstahlung?

707
00:55:30,651 --> 00:55:31,234
复活节辐射？
Osterstahlung?

708
00:55:31,484 --> 00:55:33,985
我的意思是，那个地方不是有点非法吗？
I mean, isn't that place somewhat illegal?

709
00:55:34,901 --> 00:55:35,901
一定很美味。
It must get delicious.

710
00:55:36,401 --> 00:55:37,943
是的，这两件事都有，对吗？
Yeah, it is both of those things, yeah?

711
00:55:38,193 --> 00:55:38,401
唔？
Hmm?

712
00:55:38,651 --> 00:55:39,931
它距离这里并不远。
It's what's so not far from here.

713
00:55:40,443 --> 00:55:41,461
这没什么好说的。
It's not a blast.

714
00:55:41,485 --> 00:55:42,526
哇哦！
Whoa!

715
00:55:44,485 --> 00:55:45,485
你还好吗？
You all right?

716
00:55:47,235 --> 00:55:48,235
是的。
Yeah.

717
00:55:48,776 --> 00:55:51,776
再见，泰格勒。
A viero, Tegeler.

718
00:55:53,776 --> 00:55:54,877
眨眼国家。
Winky country.

719
00:55:54,901 --> 00:55:56,235
噢，我要一些。
Oh, I'll have some.

720
00:55:56,693 --> 00:55:57,693
一位巴赫的樵夫。
A Bach woodsman.

721
00:55:59,485 --> 00:56:00,485
来自一个小矮人的土地。
Of a munchkin land.

722
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:04,735
伟大的。
Great.

723
00:56:04,985 --> 00:56:05,443
打扰一下。
Excuse me.

724
00:56:05,735 --> 00:56:06,877
很高兴知道。
Good to know.

725
00:56:06,901 --> 00:56:07,985
你刚刚又在说什么？
What were you saying again?

726
00:56:08,693 --> 00:56:10,818
哦，他用小提琴问我们。
Oh, he asked us in the violin.

727
00:56:11,526 --> 00:56:13,252
不幸的是，这是针对 Shiz
Unfortunately, it's against Shiz

728
00:56:13,276 --> 00:56:14,836
天黑后进城的规则。
rules to go into town after dark.

729
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:15,919
我认为再次
I think that once again that the

730
00:56:15,943 --> 00:56:17,818
腐蚀我的同学的责任
responsibility to corrupt my fellow students

731
00:56:18,485 --> 00:56:19,485
对我来说是改革。
reforms to me.

732
00:56:20,943 --> 00:56:21,943
打扰一下。
Excuse me.

733
00:56:32,485 --> 00:56:35,628
学校的问题是，他们
The trouble with the schools is, they

734
00:56:35,652 --> 00:56:38,360
总是试图传授错误的教训。
always try to teach the wrong lesson.

735
00:56:40,652 --> 00:56:46,253
相信我，我被踢过
Believe me, I've been kicked

736
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:49,068
他们中有足够的人知道。
out of enough of them to know.

737
00:56:51,485 --> 00:56:54,485
希望一个人能够变得不那么卑鄙，不那么肤浅。
May one should become less galler, less shallower.

738
00:56:55,485 --> 00:57:00,694
但我说为什么要强调呢？
But I say why invite stressing?

739
00:57:08,069 --> 00:57:09,944
停止研究冲突。
Stop studying strife.

740
00:57:13,444 --> 00:57:17,069
并学会生活。
And learn to live.

741
00:57:18,235 --> 00:57:20,485
未经审查。
The unexamined.

742
00:57:21,485 --> 00:57:25,319
未经审查。
The unexamined.

743
00:57:31,485 --> 00:57:33,836
舞动人生，掠过
Dancing through life, skimming

744
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:38,110
表面，滑过我最艰难的心情。
surface, gliding my toughest mood.

745
00:57:39,527 --> 00:57:42,777
生活越是无痛苦，就越是无脑。
Life's more painless, more the brainless.

746
00:57:43,486 --> 00:57:46,503
在如此舒缓的时候擦拭得太用力。
Wiping too hard when it's so soothing.

747
00:57:46,527 --> 00:57:50,902
人生如舞，无需坚强。
Dancing through life, no need to tough it.

748
00:57:51,194 --> 00:57:54,777
当你可以摆脱它时，我会做什么。
When you can slough it off, what I do.

749
00:57:55,486 --> 00:57:58,902
一切都不重要，但知道一切都不重要。
Nothing matters, but knowing nothing matters.

750
00:57:59,486 --> 00:58:00,902
这就是生活。
It's just life.

751
00:58:01,819 --> 00:58:03,611
翩翩起舞。
Dancing through.

752
00:58:18,777 --> 00:58:21,129
生命之舞，摇摆，
Dancing through life, swaying,

753
00:58:21,153 --> 00:58:25,236
清扫，并始终保持凉爽。
sweeping, and always keeping cool.

754
00:58:26,486 --> 00:58:29,694
当你轻率时，生活就没有欺诈。
Life is fraudless when you're thoughtless.

755
00:58:30,278 --> 00:58:33,403
那些不去尝试的人永远不会愚蠢。
Those who don't try, never foolish.

756
00:58:34,153 --> 00:58:37,403
无忧无虑、无忧无虑地在生活中翩翩起舞。
Dancing through life, mindless and careless.

757
00:58:37,861 --> 00:58:41,278
确定你一文不值，麻烦就是对的。
Make sure you're worthless, trouble is right.

758
00:58:41,778 --> 00:58:44,504
祸患稍纵即逝，打击却转瞬即逝。
Woes are fleeting, blows are glancing.

759
00:58:44,528 --> 00:58:52,528
当你在生活中翩翩起舞时。
When you're dancing through life.

760
00:59:08,486 --> 00:59:10,486
我又要出去学习了。
I'm gonna go study outside again.

761
00:59:17,528 --> 00:59:25,528
让我们去最奇怪的沙尘暴室看看。
Let's go down to the oddest dust bowl room.

762
00:59:25,986 --> 00:59:28,528
我们今晚晚些时候会在那里见面。
We'll meet there later tonight.

763
00:59:29,486 --> 00:59:35,195
我们可以随着滑梯跳舞，寻找最漂亮的女孩。
We can dance to the slide, find the prettiest girl.

764
00:59:35,778 --> 00:59:38,671
活一会儿，休息一下
Live for a while, break on

765
00:59:38,695 --> 00:59:41,504
一直到最奇怪的沙尘暴房间。
down to the oddest dust bowl room.

766
00:59:41,528 --> 00:59:48,070
来吧，跟我进去，你会很高兴的。
Come on, follow me in, you'll be happy to be.

767
00:59:48,528 --> 00:59:53,237
人生如舞，无需坚强。
Dancing through life, no need to tough it.

768
00:59:53,528 --> 00:59:56,612
只因我们身处尘土。
Only because dust is what we come to.

769
00:59:57,487 --> 01:00:01,112
一切都不重要，但知道一切都不重要。
Nothing matters, but knowing nothing matters.

770
01:00:02,028 --> 01:00:03,820
这就是生活。
It's just life.

771
01:00:08,028 --> 01:00:10,487
这就是生活。
It's just life.

772
01:00:11,487 --> 01:00:13,487
我继续跳舞。
I keep dancing through.

773
01:00:19,987 --> 01:00:22,487
加琳达，加琳达，在这里。
Galinda, Galinda, here.

774
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:30,279
留着吧。我有很多。我哭了很多次。
Keep it. I've got many. I cry a lot.

775
01:00:31,362 --> 01:00:32,380
好吧，谢谢你。
Well, thank you.

776
01:00:32,404 --> 01:00:35,546
我希望你今晚能为我节省并跳舞。我会
I hope you'll save and dance for me tonight. I'll be

777
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:38,463
就在那里，等待了一整夜。
right there, waiting all night.

778
01:00:38,487 --> 01:00:42,862
太客气了。但你知道什么会更客气吗？
That's so kind. But you know what would be even kinder?

779
01:00:43,154 --> 01:00:44,213
悲惨地看到
See that tragically

780
01:00:44,237 --> 01:00:47,654
坐在椅子上的那个女孩很漂亮。
beautiful girl, the one in the chair.

781
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:52,612
这看起来太不公平了，我们应该疯狂地狂欢。
It seems so unfair, we should go on a spree.

782
01:00:53,362 --> 01:00:57,904
而她却不是，天哪，我知道有人会成为我的英雄。
And not she, gee, I know someone would be my hero.

783
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:03,487
如果是的话我们就去邀请她。
If that's the one we're to go invite her.

784
01:01:04,487 --> 01:01:08,362
好吧，也许我可以邀请她。
Well, maybe I can invite her.

785
01:01:09,571 --> 01:01:13,446
哦，维克，真的吗？你会为我这么做的。
Oh, Vic, really? You would do that for me.

786
01:01:18,362 --> 01:01:19,654
我愿意为你做任何事。
I would do anything for you.

787
01:01:20,779 --> 01:01:21,779
出色地？
Well?

788
01:01:22,279 --> 01:01:23,279
哦，现在。
Oh, right now.

789
01:01:23,612 --> 01:01:24,130
为什么不呢？
Why not?

790
01:01:24,154 --> 01:01:25,154
马上去问她。
Go ask her right now.

791
01:01:25,404 --> 01:01:26,612
为什么不呢？她就在那儿。
Why not? She's right there.

792
01:01:34,487 --> 01:01:35,487
哦。
Oh.

793
01:01:44,154 --> 01:01:45,154
甚至很好。
Even good.

794
01:01:46,487 --> 01:01:47,946
我不知道你的意思。
I don't know what you mean.

795
01:01:49,363 --> 01:01:50,613
我喜欢帮助别人。
I love helping others.

796
01:01:51,488 --> 01:01:55,404
哦。而且我今晚正好有空。
Oh. And I happen to be free tonight, after all.

797
01:01:56,571 --> 01:01:59,029
现在这种和平意味着彼此。
Now this peace meant one another.

798
01:01:59,529 --> 01:02:04,089
显然我们是彼此的挚爱。
It's clear we deserve each other.

799
01:02:04,113 --> 01:02:04,696
你很完美。
You're perfect.

800
01:02:05,029 --> 01:02:05,631
你很完美。
You're perfect.

801
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:07,738
所以我们在一起很完美。
So we're perfect together.

802
01:02:08,779 --> 01:02:11,529
一、二、三、四，永远。
One, two, three, four, ever.

803
01:02:12,071 --> 01:02:15,863
这就是生活。
This is the life.

804
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:24,964
你绝对猜不到我刚才发生了什么事。
You'll never guess what just happened to me.

805
01:02:24,988 --> 01:02:25,196
什么？
What?

806
01:02:25,529 --> 01:02:29,904
那个超级可爱的小男孩刚刚约我出去。
That perfectly adorable munchkin boy just asked me out.

807
01:02:30,196 --> 01:02:32,113
他说他一开始太害羞，不敢问我。
He said he was too shy to ask me at first.

808
01:02:32,363 --> 01:02:34,631
但后来加琳达鼓励了他。
But then Galinda emboldened him.

809
01:02:34,655 --> 01:02:35,756
等等，加琳达。
Wait, Galinda.

810
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:36,881
不。
Don't.

811
01:02:36,905 --> 01:02:39,571
你可别再说她坏话了。
Don't you dare say another word against her.

812
01:02:40,696 --> 01:02:43,696
我即将度过一生中最幸福的夜晚。
I'm about to have the happiest night of my life.

813
01:02:45,071 --> 01:02:46,613
感谢加琳达。
Thanks to Galinda.

814
01:02:48,905 --> 01:02:50,464
终于在这一晚，
Finally for this one night,

815
01:02:50,488 --> 01:02:56,488
我即将和这个小男孩度过一个愉快的夜晚，
I'm about to have a fun night with this munchkin boy,

816
01:02:57,030 --> 01:02:59,196
加琳达帮我找到的。
Galinda found for me.

817
01:02:59,821 --> 01:03:02,422
我只希望
And I only wish there were

818
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:08,488
我可以为她做些事来回报她。
something I could do for her to repay her.

819
01:03:09,155 --> 01:03:13,738
埃尔法巴，你看，我们是天生一对。
Elphaba, see, we deserve each other.

820
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:16,905
加琳达 (Galinda) 帮助这个梦想成为了现实。
And Galinda helped it come true.

821
01:03:18,488 --> 01:03:20,238
我们彼此珍惜。
We deserve each other.

822
01:03:20,613 --> 01:03:21,613
我和巴赫。
Me and Bach.

823
01:03:23,405 --> 01:03:24,947
埃尔法巴，请你试着去理解。
Please, Elphaba, try to understand.

824
01:03:26,322 --> 01:03:29,030
我不知道。
I don't.

825
01:03:30,488 --> 01:03:31,697
一二三。
One, two, three.

826
01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:32,572
就是这样。
That was it.

827
01:03:32,905 --> 01:03:33,322
就是这样。
That was it.

828
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:34,405
它是完美的。
And it's perfect.

829
01:03:34,697 --> 01:03:34,905
甜的。
Sweet.

830
01:03:35,238 --> 01:03:38,155
让我们想起海里最可耻的小鱼。
Remind us the most scandalous little fish in the sea.

831
01:03:38,405 --> 01:03:39,405
最多。
The most.

832
01:03:39,822 --> 01:03:42,488
我们将会失去你留在他心中的东西。
We are just going to lose what you left in his mind.

833
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:44,447
我们成功了。
And be we nailed it.

834
01:03:44,697 --> 01:03:45,697
现在赶紧行动吧。
Now hurry up.

835
01:03:46,488 --> 01:03:47,839
好吧，我不敢相信我们
Okay, I can't believe that we

836
01:03:47,863 --> 01:03:53,173
只是今天还没有到十字路口。
just haven't the crossroads today.

837
01:03:53,197 --> 01:03:54,197
我说得对吗？
Am I right?

838
01:03:54,572 --> 01:03:55,572
一...
Um...

839
01:03:56,197 --> 01:03:57,197
那个。
Ew.

840
01:03:57,947 --> 01:03:58,989
这是为什么呢？
Why even is that?

841
01:03:59,489 --> 01:04:00,489
加琳达？
Galinda?

842
01:04:02,822 --> 01:04:03,822
原因何在？
What's the reason?

843
01:04:04,822 --> 01:04:05,155
我知道。
I know.

844
01:04:05,447 --> 01:04:06,447
这是我的奶奶。
It's my granny.

845
01:04:06,739 --> 01:04:08,739
她总是给我造出最丑陋的房子。
She always makes me the most hideous house.

846
01:04:09,447 --> 01:04:12,572
我会把它赠予他人，但我并没有那么恨任何人。
I'd give it away, but I don't hate anyone that much.

847
01:04:15,530 --> 01:04:18,239
我不能。
I couldn't.

848
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,280
我可以嗎？

您与我们一起来到奥兹尘埃。

嗯，因为每个人都会去那里。

别告诉我你没衣服穿。

873
01:05:07,406 --> 01:05:08,489
是的，你可以穿这个。

它与您拥有的一切相配。

它确实很锋利。

877
01:05:17,323 --> 01:05:18,323
你不这么认为吗？

878
01:05:18,614 --> 01:05:19,632
你知道吗？
You know, what?

879
01:05:19,656 --> 01:05:20,781
这是来说话的吗？
Is this here to speak?

880
01:05:21,531 --> 01:05:23,489
你们是彼此的挚爱。

所以在这里我会知道我内心的善良。

我们将会被捕。

885

抱歉打扰您，夫人

内萨，我有件事要坦白。

哦，鲍勃，我知道为什么。

891
01:07:41,615 --> 01:07:42,615
你做？
You do?

892
01:07:43,157 --> 01:07:45,216
因为我身处其中
It's because I'm in this

893
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:48,324
椅子，你对我感到难过。

894

嗯，不是吗？

我并不为你感到难过。

899
01:07:55,907 --> 01:07:58,508
我问你是因为...因为...

我？

912
01:09:00,491 --> 01:09:04,050
然后您就可以继续做这件事了。
And you can go back to doing whatever this is.

913

事实上，我对你没有信心。

928
01:09:36,116 --> 01:09:39,116
这是你室友的主意，不是我的。
This is your roommate's idea, not mine.

929
01:09:41,158 --> 01:09:42,158
我很困惑。

否则她就会辞职。

为什么？

937
01:09:56,658 --> 01:09:58,283
我是一个女巫师，不是一位读心者。
I'm a sorceress, not a mind reader.

938
01:09:58,658 --> 01:10:02,366
我不知道为什么，但是我不能冒险失去她。

你不具备所需的条件。

我希望你能证明我错了。

943
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:14,200
我不相信你会这么做。
I doubt you will.

944
01:10:16,492 --> 01:10:18,093
你也许想感谢她。

阿尔萨很多。

01:13:22,243 --> 01:13:26,951
我没法看。
I can't watch.

951

我帮助阿尔法。

952
01:13:31,493 --> 01:13:32,493
为什么？
Why?

953
01:13:33,326 --> 01:13:34,686
难道你不会回到家吗？
Is it not my case you'll fall home?

954
01:13:44,493 --> 01:13:46,910
打扰一下。
Excuse me.

955
01:14:38,494 --> 01:14:39,577

961
01:17:37,287 --> 01:17:38,287
那很有趣。
That was funny.

嗯，这不公平。

秘密在于他有一个很好的理由。

997
01:19:20,079 --> 01:19:21,746
那么我的姐姐就是这个样子。
Then my sister is the way she is.

998
01:19:26,038 --> 01:19:27,358
当我妈妈怀着 Nessa 的时候，
When my mother was carrying Nessa,

999
01:19:27,621 --> 01:19:30,204
我父亲开始担心她会出来。
my father began to worry that she might come out.

1000
01:19:30,538 --> 01:19:31,538
呻吟。
Groan.

1001
01:19:34,371 --> 01:19:35,847
他太担心了，以至于让我妈妈
He was so worried that he made my mother

1002
01:19:35,871 --> 01:19:40,413
日夜治疗乳花。
treat milkflowers day and night.

1003
01:19:41,413 --> 01:19:45,597
只有乳花让内萨来得太早
Only the milkflowers made Nessa come too soon

1004
01:19:45,621 --> 01:19:49,621
还有她的小腿。
and her little legs there.

1005
01:19:53,496 --> 01:19:59,288
而我的母亲，她再也没有醒来。
And my mother, well, she never woke up.

1006
01:20:01,496 --> 01:20:02,390
所有这些都不会
None of which would have ever

1007
01:20:02,414 --> 01:20:06,288
如果不是我，这一切就会发生。
happened if it wasn't for me.

1008
01:20:08,496 --> 01:20:11,913
所以这是我的错。
So it's my fault.

1009
01:20:13,955 --> 01:20:14,413
什么？
What?

1010
01:20:14,871 --> 01:20:15,871
不。
No.

1011
01:20:16,621 --> 01:20:20,205
那是 milkflowers 的错，不是你的错。
That was the milkflowers fault, not yours.

1012
01:20:22,830 --> 01:20:24,139
这可能是你的秘密，埃尔法巴，
That might be your secret, Elphaba,

1013
01:20:24,163 --> 01:20:25,514
但这并不能证明这是事实。
but that doesn't make it true.

1014
01:20:29,996 --> 01:20:30,996
看。
Look.

1015
01:20:32,455 --> 01:20:33,455
就是明天。
It's tomorrow.

1016
01:20:39,205 --> 01:20:40,205
还有艾尔西……
And Elsie...

1017
01:20:40,913 --> 01:20:42,014
我可以叫你艾尔西吗？
Can I call you Elsie?

1018
01:20:42,038 --> 01:20:43,098
嗯，有点活泼。
Well, it's a little bit perky.

1019
01:20:43,122 --> 01:20:43,622
我知道。
I know.

1020
01:20:43,997 --> 01:20:45,747
我知道那时我会给你打电话。
I know who I'm gonna call you then.

1021
01:20:46,663 --> 01:20:48,997
你也可以打电话给我。
And you can call me.

1022
01:20:49,997 --> 01:20:50,247
加伦达。
Galenda.

1023
01:20:50,663 --> 01:20:51,764
那是你的名字。
That is your name.

1024
01:20:51,788 --> 01:20:52,788
咱们别吵架了。
Let's not quarrel.

1025
01:20:53,497 --> 01:20:57,497
艾尔西，现在我们是朋友了，
Elsie, now that we're friends,

1026
01:20:59,622 --> 01:21:01,247
我已决定将你作为我的新项目。
I've decided to make you my new project.

1027
01:21:01,622 --> 01:21:03,098
嗯，你真的不必这么做。
Well, you really don't have to do that.

1028
01:21:03,122 --> 01:21:04,122
我知道。
I know.

1029
01:21:05,163 --> 01:21:06,497
这就是我这么友善的原因。
That's what makes me so nice.

1030
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:12,955
每当我看到比我不幸的人......
Whenever I see someone less fortunate than I...

1031
01:21:13,205 --> 01:21:14,413
让我们面对现实吧，对吧？
And let's face it, right?

1032
01:21:14,955 --> 01:21:15,414
谁不是呢？
Who isn't?

1033
01:21:15,955 --> 01:21:17,747
我没有那么幸运，
Less fortunate than I,

1034
01:21:18,539 --> 01:21:21,497
我那颗温柔的心开始流血。
my tender heart tends to start to bleed.

1035
01:21:22,497 --> 01:21:24,205
当有人需要改头换面时，
And when someone needs a makeover,

1036
01:21:24,455 --> 01:21:26,039
我必须接手。
I simply have to take over.

1037
01:21:26,330 --> 01:21:27,348
我知道。
I know.

1038
01:21:27,372 --> 01:21:28,372
我知道。
I know.

1039
01:21:31,497 --> 01:21:35,955
正是他们所需要的。
Exactly what they need.

1040
01:21:36,914 --> 01:21:38,830
甚至在你的情况下......
And even in your case...

1041
01:21:44,830 --> 01:21:47,289
没关系。
Never mind.

1042
01:21:48,122 --> 01:21:48,515
是的。
Yeah.

1043
01:21:48,539 --> 01:21:52,806
好的，我要把它们放回这里。
Okay, I'm gonna put these right back on here.

1044
01:21:52,830 --> 01:21:56,473
尽管这是最棘手的案例
Though it's the toughest case

1045
01:21:56,497 --> 01:21:57,997
为什么是界面？
Why the interface?

1046
01:21:59,122 --> 01:22:03,598
别担心，我决心成功
Don't worry, I'm determined to succeed

1047
01:22:03,622 --> 01:22:08,515
跟随我的轻松
Follow my ease

1048
01:22:08,539 --> 01:22:15,622
如果你确实会
If indeed you will be

1049
01:22:23,247 --> 01:22:27,557
我会帮助你变得受欢迎
I'll help you be popular

1050
01:22:27,581 --> 01:22:30,515
受欢迎，你会受欢迎的
Popular, you're gonna be popular

1051
01:22:30,539 --> 01:22:33,348
我会教你正确的声音
I'll teach you the proper voice

1052
01:22:33,372 --> 01:22:34,682
当你和男孩说话时
When you talk to boys

1053
01:22:34,706 --> 01:22:37,015
礼貌和信任你的方法
The ways to polite and trust you

1054
01:22:37,039 --> 01:22:38,682
我会告诉你如何选择穿着
I'll show you how to choose to wear

1055
01:22:38,706 --> 01:22:40,206
如何整理头发
How to fix your hair

1056
01:22:40,498 --> 01:22:43,748
一切真正重要的事都是受欢迎的
Everything that really counts to be popular

1057
01:22:44,498 --> 01:22:46,474
我会帮助你变得受欢迎
I'll help you be popular

1058
01:22:46,498 --> 01:22:49,474
你会坚持正确的路线
You'll hang with the right course

1059
01:22:49,498 --> 01:22:50,807
你会变得非常强大
You'll be good as force

1060
01:22:50,831 --> 01:22:53,474
没有你想知道的俚语
No the slang you want to know

1061
01:22:53,498 --> 01:22:54,474
让我们开始吧
So let's start

1062
01:22:54,498 --> 01:22:59,873
因为你还有很长的路要走
Cause you've got an awfully long way to go

1063
01:23:01,498 --> 01:23:04,599
别因为我的坦率分析而生气
Don't be offended by my frank analysis

1064
01:23:04,623 --> 01:23:06,331
将其视为个人分析
Think of it as personal analysis

1065
01:23:07,498 --> 01:23:10,474
既然我选择成为一名超级姐妹
Now that I've chosen to become a power sister

1066
01:23:10,498 --> 01:23:12,807
在没有人比我更聪明的时代
In a time where there's nobody wiser

1067
01:23:12,831 --> 01:23:14,789
不谈流行
Not when it comes to popular

1068
01:23:15,539 --> 01:23:17,623
我知道流行
I know about popular

1069
01:23:18,498 --> 01:23:20,516
在我的协助下
And with an assist from me

1070
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:22,016
做你自己
It's be who you be

1071
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:24,081
你穿的是不是梦想家？
Is it a dreamer who you wear?

1072
01:23:24,373 --> 01:23:26,141
好吧，R，没有什么可以阻止你
Well, R, there's nothing that can stop you

1073
01:23:26,165 --> 01:23:27,682
从你越来越受欢迎
From your coming popular

1074
01:23:27,706 --> 01:23:28,706
是的！
Yeah!

1075
01:23:29,665 --> 01:23:29,790
更多的
More

1076
01:23:30,498 --> 01:23:35,540
啦啦啦啦啦啦
La la la la la la

1077
01:23:36,498 --> 01:23:39,331
我们会让你受欢迎
We're gonna make you popular

1078
01:23:41,498 --> 01:23:42,915
这不会奏效
This isn't gonna work

1079
01:23:43,498 --> 01:23:44,516
什么？
What?

1080
01:23:44,540 --> 01:23:45,665
艾尔西！
Elsie!

1081
01:23:46,373 --> 01:23:48,474
你不应该这么想
You mustn't think that way

1082
01:23:48,498 --> 01:23:50,682
你的整个生活将会改变
Your whole life is gonna change

1083
01:23:50,706 --> 01:23:53,307
这一切都是因为我
And it's all because of me

1084
01:23:53,331 --> 01:23:55,182
快点
Come on

1085
01:23:55,206 --> 01:23:57,932
当我看到令人沮丧的生物
When I see depressing creatures

1086
01:23:57,956 --> 01:24:00,557
带着愤怒的占有特征
With angry possessing features

1087
01:24:00,581 --> 01:24:03,058
我提醒他们自己的
I remind them of their own

1088
01:24:03,082 --> 01:24:05,849
我们必须考虑
We have to think of

1089
01:24:05,873 --> 01:24:08,474
庆祝国家文本
Celebrating texts of state

1090
01:24:08,498 --> 01:24:10,915
或者特别善于沟通的人
Or especially great communicators

1091
01:24:11,540 --> 01:24:13,873
他们到底有没脑子？
Did they have brains or not?

1092
01:24:14,248 --> 01:24:14,642
嗯，实际上
Well, actually

1093
01:24:14,666 --> 01:24:15,891
别让我笑
Don't make me laugh

1094
01:24:15,915 --> 01:24:16,974
他们
They were

1095
01:24:16,998 --> 01:24:17,474
受欢迎的
Popular

1096
01:24:17,498 --> 01:24:18,498
正确的！
Right!

1097
01:24:18,957 --> 01:24:20,474
一切都关乎流行
It's all about popular

1098
01:24:20,498 --> 01:24:23,058
这与能力无关
It's not about aptitude

1099
01:24:23,082 --> 01:24:24,599
这就是你的感受
It's the way you're feeling

1100
01:24:24,623 --> 01:24:27,248
所以这是真的
So it's very true to be

1101
01:24:27,498 --> 01:24:28,957
非常受欢迎
Very popular

1102
01:24:29,498 --> 01:24:32,248
像我这样的
Like me

1103
01:24:34,498 --> 01:24:35,165
头发
Hair

1104
01:24:35,498 --> 01:24:36,248

头发

1106
01:24:37,498 --> 01:24:39,933
我们甩动头发
We toss our hair

1107
01:24:39,957 --> 01:24:40,957
准备好？
Ready?

1108
01:24:42,207 --> 01:24:43,207
抛掷，抛掷
Toss, toss

1109
01:24:45,499 --> 01:24:47,374
抛掷，抛掷
Toss, toss

1110
01:24:51,082 --> 01:24:52,082
这是一个选择
That's a choice

1111
01:24:52,499 --> 01:24:55,207
接下来我要把这个简单的
Next, I'm gonna transform this simple

1112
01:24:55,624 --> 01:24:56,308
连衣裙
Frock

1113
01:24:56,332 --> 01:24:56,934
斜纹大衣
Slash coat

1114
01:24:56,958 --> 01:24:58,100
这个简单的喉咙
This simple throat

1115
01:24:58,124 --> 01:24:58,684
噓
Boop

1116
01:24:58,708 --> 01:25:00,665
穿上华丽的舞会礼服
Into a magnificent ball gown

1117
01:25:02,874 --> 01:25:03,601
舞会礼服

01:25:08,332 --> 01:25:09,332
舞会礼服
Ball gown

1120
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:12,475
快点
Come on

1121
01:25:12,499 --> 01:25:13,749
快点
Come on

1122
01:25:14,332 --> 01:25:15,374
杀了你
Killing on you

1123
01:25:25,499 --> 01:25:26,791
舞会礼服
Ball gown

1124
01:25:28,499 --> 01:25:29,666
严重地？
Seriously?

1125
01:25:29,999 --> 01:25:30,975
你需要我的帮助吗？
Do you need my help?

1126
01:25:30,999 --> 01:25:32,183
不，只要戴上喉咙
No, just wear the throat

1127
01:25:32,207 --> 01:25:33,207
很漂亮
It's pretty

1128
01:25:35,499 --> 01:25:37,475
让我们从小处做起
Let's just start a little smaller

1129
01:25:37,499 --> 01:25:39,392
您先请，夫人
After you, madame

1130
01:25:39,416 --> 01:25:40,475
你？
You?

1131
01:25:40,499 --> 01:25:41,499
让我们来看看
Let's see

1132
01:25:43,499 --> 01:25:44,475
不
No

1133
01:25:44,499 --> 01:25:45,499
哦
Oh

1134
01:25:47,082 --> 01:25:48,082
或许
Maybe

1135
01:25:49,499 --> 01:25:51,624
就这个
Just this

1136
01:25:56,416 --> 01:25:57,517
粉色和绿色很搭
Pink goes good with green

1137
01:25:57,541 --> 01:25:59,975
与绿色很相配
Goes well with green

1138
01:25:59,999 --> 01:26:01,291
确实如此
It so does

1139
01:26:18,124 --> 01:26:19,225
我是一个自私的人
I'm a self-a-beth

1140
01:26:19,249 --> 01:26:24,309
看看你
Look at you

1141
01:26:24,333 --> 01:26:25,458
嘿
Hey

1142
01:26:27,249 --> 01:26:27,935
你非常美
You're beautiful

1143
01:26:27,959 --> 01:26:33,975
我们必须走了
We have to go

1144
01:26:33,999 --> 01:26:34,999
在哪里？
Where?

1145
01:26:36,083 --> 01:26:37,642
在哪里？
Where?

1146
01:26:37,666 --> 01:26:38,475
在哪里？
Where?

1147
01:26:38,499 --> 01:26:40,099
哪里？哪里？哪里？哪里？哪里？哪里？
Where? Where? Where? Where? Where? Where?

1148
01:26:42,541 --> 01:26:43,541
不客气
You're welcome

1149
01:26:45,499 --> 01:26:46,809
哦，你好
Oh, hello

1150
01:26:46,833 --> 01:26:54,833
尽管你抗议
And though you protest

1151
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:58,083
你是去中心化的
You're decentralized

1152
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:03,000
我知道真相
I know condacity

1153
01:27:11,166 --> 01:27:19,166
你是美国的光纤，看起来不像我那么受欢迎
You're fiber in America It doesn't look quite as popular as me

1154
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,000
你被激怒了
You've been gallindified

1155
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:29,143
你不需要这么做，你知道
You don't need to do that, you know

1156
01:28:29,167 --> 01:28:32,917
来吧，我们去拿手套
Come on, let's get the gloves

1157
01:28:35,375 --> 01:28:37,768
D 博士
Dr. D

1158
01:28:37,792 --> 01:28:39,976
我打电话给医生，我发现了他的电话
I called me a doctor, I found his phone

1159
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,167
他需要成功预约你
He needs a successful appointment to you

1160
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:43,352
有一天我会打电话给你
I'll call you one day

1161
01:28:43,376 --> 01:28:45,101
D 博士
Dr. D

1162
01:28:45,125 --> 01:28:53,125
亲爱的同学们，这将是我在 Chis 的最后一天
My dear students, this will be my last day here at Chis

1163
01:29:00,542 --> 01:29:05,060
你看，动物不再被允许教导
You see, animals are no longer permitted to teach

1164
01:29:05,084 --> 01:29:05,667
什么？
What?

1165
01:29:06,084 --> 01:29:09,251
没关系，埃尔法巴小姐，我会没事的，我……
It's alright Miss Elphaba, I'll be alright, I...

1166
01:29:16,501 --> 01:29:18,626
同学们，保持冷静，
Students, remain calm,

1167
01:29:18,876 --> 01:29:20,935
请不要惊慌
please, there's no cause for alarm

1168
01:29:20,959 --> 01:29:22,209
这是什么？发生什么事了？
What is this, what's happening?

1169
01:29:22,667 --> 01:29:23,667
来吧，山羊
Come on, goat

1170
01:29:25,501 --> 01:29:27,518
你不能允许这种事
You can't permit this

1171
01:29:27,542 --> 01:29:30,102
艾尔法巴，恐怕我们无能为力
Elphaba, I'm afraid it's out of our hands

1172
01:29:30,126 --> 01:29:31,810
他们可以夺走我的工作，但是
They can take away my job, but

1173
01:29:31,834 --> 01:29:33,477
我会继续发声
I shall continue speaking out

1174
01:29:33,501 --> 01:29:37,543
听我说，你不知道全部情况
Listen to me, you're not being told the whole story

1175
01:29:42,501 --> 01:29:44,261
我们难道都只能坐在这里默默无语吗？
Are we all just going to sit here in silence?

1176
01:29:47,501 --> 01:29:50,084
够了，艾尔法巴小姐
That's quite enough, Miss Elphaba

1177
01:29:52,543 --> 01:29:53,543
就座
Take your seat

1178
01:30:10,501 --> 01:30:13,727
同学们，你们的新历史教授
Students, your new history professor

1179
01:30:13,751 --> 01:30:16,918
准备了特别演讲
has prepared a special presentation

1180
01:30:33,585 --> 01:30:35,126
各位同学下午好
Good afternoon, students

1181
01:30:35,501 --> 01:30:40,186
下午好
Good afternoon

1182
01:30:40,210 --> 01:30:44,852
在这样的时代，我们所有人都应该
In times such as these, it behooves us all

1183
01:30:44,876 --> 01:30:50,293
不仅要研究过去，更要展望未来
Not merely to study the past, but to look to the future

1184
01:30:53,501 --> 01:30:57,686
这叫做笼子
This is called a cage

1185
01:30:57,710 --> 01:31:05,710
这项非凡的创新对所有人都有好处
This remarkable innovation is for the good of all odds

1186
01:31:07,085 --> 01:31:09,478
这不仅对动物有好处，你看
As well as for the animals' own good, you see

1187
01:31:09,502 --> 01:31:11,543
如果一切都好，他为何还颤抖？
If it's all good, why is he trembling?

1188
01:31:17,085 --> 01:31:18,502
他很高兴来到这里
He's just happy to be here

1189
01:31:20,627 --> 01:31:23,603
现在，把这么小的动物关在笼子里的好处之一是
Now, one benefit of caging an animal this young is that

1190
01:31:23,627 --> 01:31:26,127
很可能他永远学不会说话
in all likelihood, he'll never learn to speak

1191
01:31:26,502 --> 01:31:30,186
笼子的尺寸会有所不同宣传
The dimensions of the cage will vary publicize the

1192
01:31:30,210 --> 01:31:32,686
动物，但基本设计保持不变
animal, but the basic design remains the same

1193
01:31:32,710 --> 01:31:35,478
让我告诉你
Let me show you

1194
01:31:35,502 --> 01:31:40,311
你能想象动物被关在笼子里的世界吗
Can you imagine a world where animals are kept in cages

1195
01:31:40,335 --> 01:31:41,710
他们从来没学过说话？
and they never learn to speak?

1196
01:31:42,085 --> 01:31:43,311
这款蓝线杯看起来
This blue line cup seems so

1197
01:31:43,335 --> 01:31:45,419
框架，我们该怎么办？
framed, what are we going to do?

1198
01:31:46,044 --> 01:31:47,044
对不起，我？
Sorry, me?

1199
01:31:47,377 --> 01:31:48,737
好吧，总得有人做点什么
Well, someone's got to do something

1200
01:32:20,502 --> 01:32:23,586
嘿，嘿，嘿，嘿，过来
Hey, hey, hey, hey, come here

1201
01:32:26,502 --> 01:32:27,502
怎么了？
What is happening?

1202
01:32:28,627 --> 01:32:32,377
我不知道，我对此很生气
I don't know, I got mad at it

1203
01:32:32,961 --> 01:32:34,001
菲罗，你在做什么？
Fiero, what are you doing?

1204
01:32:36,294 --> 01:32:39,127
嗯，你来吗？来吧
Well, you coming? Come on

1205
01:32:45,252 --> 01:32:46,252
看
Look

1206
01:32:47,461 --> 01:32:50,544
别担心，我说
Don't worry, I said

1207
01:32:51,502 --> 01:32:53,252
我们走了
There we go

1208
01:33:18,503 --> 01:33:20,211
这个名字对于我们来说意味着什么？
What did the name mean for us?

1209
01:33:56,545 --> 01:33:58,461
我不需要吓唬你
I don't need to scare you

1210
01:34:01,253 --> 01:34:03,503
为什么你总是会引起一些骚动？
Why is it you're always causing some sort of commotion?

1211
01:34:03,961 --> 01:34:05,979
我不制造骚动，我就是其中之一
I don't cause commotions, I am one

1212
01:34:06,003 --> 01:34:07,479
是的，这是肯定的
Yeah, well that's for sure

1213
01:34:07,503 --> 01:34:09,271
所以你认为我应该继续我的
So you think I should just keep my

1214
01:34:09,295 --> 01:34:10,815
闭嘴，这就是你要说的吗？
mouth shut, is that what you're saying?

1215
01:34:11,420 --> 01:34:12,729
什么，不，不，我在说什么
What, no, no, I'm saying

1216
01:34:12,753 --> 01:34:14,146
你以为我想这样吗？
You think I want to be this way?

1217
01:34:14,170 --> 01:34:14,479
我认为
I think

1218
01:34:14,503 --> 01:34:16,146
你以为我会这么关心吗？
You think I want to care this much?

1219
01:34:16,170 --> 01:34:16,521
我是说
I mean

1220
01:34:16,545 --> 01:34:17,480
我知道我的生活将会
I know that my life would be

1221
01:34:17,504 --> 01:34:18,812
如果我不在乎的话就容易多了
much easier if I didn't care about

1222
01:34:18,836 --> 01:34:20,045
你曾经让别人说话吗？
You ever let anyone else talk?

1223
01:34:23,086 --> 01:34:24,086
对不起
Sorry

1224
01:34:25,836 --> 01:34:25,980
我刚刚
I've just

1225
01:34:26,004 --> 01:34:27,420
但我还能说一件事吗？
But can I just say one more thing?

1226
01:34:29,753 --> 01:34:31,378
你本可以走开
You could have walked away back there

1227
01:34:32,253 --> 01:34:32,314
对不起
Sorry

1228
01:34:32,338 --> 01:34:34,771
所以无论多么浅薄和
So, no matter how shallow and

1229
01:34:34,795 --> 01:34:36,188
你假装自私
self-absorbed you pretend to be

1230
01:34:36,212 --> 01:34:38,396
对不起，这里没有虚伪
Excuse me, there is no pretense here

1231
01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:39,189
我恰好是真诚的
I happen to be genuinely

1232
01:34:39,213 --> 01:34:40,563
自我陶醉，肤浅无知
self-absorbed and deeply shallow

1233
01:34:40,587 --> 01:34:42,271
不，求你，你不是
No, please, no you're not

1234
01:34:42,295 --> 01:34:43,695
否则你不会这么不开心
Otherwise you wouldn't be so unhappy

1235
01:34:53,670 --> 01:34:54,105
美好的
Fine

1236
01:34:54,129 --> 01:34:58,479
如果你不需要我的帮助
If you don't want my help

1237
01:34:58,503 --> 01:35:00,878
不，我不知道
No, I don't

1238
01:35:02,003 --> 01:35:04,563
在国内，坏人就是坏人
In country, a bad guy is a bad guy

1239
01:35:04,587 --> 01:35:06,227
他是唯一一个有同样目的的人
He's the only one who has the same purpose

1240
01:35:24,504 --> 01:35:25,356
请
Please

1241
01:35:25,380 --> 01:35:33,380
你打算怎么做呢？
What did you mean to do about that?

1242
01:35:50,504 --> 01:35:53,712
但为什么你没有对那人这么做呢？
And why was that the only one you didn't do it to?

1243
01:36:01,129 --> 01:36:02,129
你在流血
You're bleeding

1244
01:36:03,504 --> 01:36:04,004
我没有
I'm not

1245
01:36:04,504 --> 01:36:05,504
嗯嗯
Mm-hmm

1246
01:36:20,504 --> 01:36:21,629
该死的
Damn it

1247
01:36:26,504 --> 01:36:28,563
我肯定抓伤了你
I must have scratched you

1248
01:36:28,587 --> 01:36:34,272
我可能抓伤了我，或者其他什么
I might have scratched me, or something

1249
01:36:34,296 --> 01:36:38,939
我最好去安全的地方
I better get to safety

1250
01:36:38,963 --> 01:36:40,647
或者成为
Or become

1251
01:36:40,671 --> 01:36:43,105
我最好进来
I better get in here

1252
01:36:43,129 --> 01:36:43,730
当然不是
Of course not

1253
01:36:43,754 --> 01:36:44,754
或成为残疾人
Or become disabled

1254
01:36:51,171 --> 01:36:52,171
箭头
The arrow

1255
01:37:19,505 --> 01:37:20,505
我需要
I need

1256
01:37:22,505 --> 01:37:23,755
心脏睡眠
Heart sleep

1257
01:37:24,505 --> 01:37:28,255
在一个获取的世界里
In a getting world

1258
01:37:30,505 --> 01:37:35,880
他可能就是那个男孩
He could be that boy

1259
01:37:37,505 --> 01:37:43,171
我不是那个女孩
I'm not that girl

1260
01:37:43,505 --> 01:37:45,713
不要做梦
Don't dream

1261
01:37:46,505 --> 01:37:50,046
太远了
Too far

1262
01:37:50,505 --> 01:37:56,213
你是谁
Down the side of who you are

1263
01:37:57,088 --> 01:38:02,547
不记得那股喜悦之情
Don't remember that rush of joy

1264
01:38:03,505 --> 01:38:08,005
他可能就是那个男孩
He could be that boy

1265
01:38:09,505 --> 01:38:12,505
我不是那个女孩
I'm not that girl

1266
01:38:13,505 --> 01:38:14,482
我不是那个女孩
I'm not that girl

1267
01:38:14,506 --> 01:38:17,148
经常生气
Angry so often

1268
01:38:17,172 --> 01:38:19,273
我们渴望偷窃
We long to steal

1269
01:38:19,297 --> 01:38:22,981
回到原本可能
To the land of what might have been

1270
01:38:23,005 --> 01:38:28,273
但这并不能减轻我们的痛苦
But that doesn't soften the ache we feel

1271
01:38:28,297 --> 01:38:33,255
当现实再次降临
When reality sits back in

1272
01:38:33,505 --> 01:38:38,523
淡淡的微笑
The light smile

1273
01:38:38,547 --> 01:38:40,606
淡淡的微笑
The light smile

1274
01:38:40,630 --> 01:38:41,524
光明四肢
The light the limb

1275
01:38:41,548 --> 01:38:45,231
她是谁
She who's one some

1276
01:38:45,255 --> 01:38:48,148
她赢得了他
She wins him

1277
01:38:48,172 --> 01:38:50,481
金色头发
Gold hair

1278
01:38:50,505 --> 01:38:54,130
带有柔和的卷曲
With a gentle curl

1279
01:38:54,505 --> 01:38:58,630
这就是他选择的女孩
That's the girl he chose

1280
01:39:01,505 --> 01:39:05,964
上天知道
And heaven knows

1281
01:39:08,214 --> 01:39:12,714
我不是那个女孩
I'm not that girl

1282
01:39:23,881 --> 01:39:24,881
不要着急
Don't rush

1283
01:39:25,506 --> 01:39:27,506
不要停止
Don't stop

1284
01:39:28,506 --> 01:39:34,964
只愿你是心
Wishing only you was the heart

1285
01:39:35,506 --> 01:39:43,506
我不是为了玫瑰和大地而生的
I wasn't born for the rose and the earth

1286
01:39:44,506 --> 01:39:48,131
作为一个女孩我知道
As a girl I know

1287
01:39:50,506 --> 01:39:54,482
他爱她的儿子
He loves her son

1288
01:39:54,506 --> 01:39:57,131
他爱我
He loves me

1289
01:40:02,506 --> 01:40:06,423
我不是那个女孩
I'm not that girl

1290
01:40:20,423 --> 01:40:22,982
我不是那个女孩
I'm not that girl

1291
01:40:23,006 --> 01:40:24,006
梅萨姆图巴！
Mesamtouba!

1292
01:40:24,506 --> 01:40:25,506
赶紧来吧！
Come at once!

1293
01:40:32,506 --> 01:40:33,506
那里！
There!

1294
01:40:36,506 --> 01:40:38,256
你必须下去。快来！
You've got to get down there. Come on!

1295
01:40:43,506 --> 01:40:47,131
Mesamtouba！我终于收到巫师的回复了！看！
Mesamtouba! I finally heard back from the wizard! Look!

1296
01:40:55,548 --> 01:40:57,006
不！停！
No! Stop!

1297
01:40:58,506 --> 01:40:59,506
我...
I...

1298
01:41:00,090 --> 01:41:01,090
你！
You!

1299
01:41:12,506 --> 01:41:14,548
这是你的。打开它。
It's yours. Open it.

1300
01:41:20,923 --> 01:41:21,923
他的皇家华硕。
His royal asus.

1301
01:41:23,173 --> 01:41:24,340
奇妙的绿野仙踪魔法师。
The wonderful wizard of Oz.

1302
01:41:25,507 --> 01:41:28,066
有人向你隆重致意
Someone's you most ceremoniously to

1303
01:41:28,090 --> 01:41:30,465
他在翡翠城的私人宫殿。
his personal palace in the Emerald City.

1304
01:41:31,882 --> 01:41:35,257
等等，此邀请不可转让。
Wait, this invitation is non-transferable.

1305
01:41:46,507 --> 01:41:49,132
这是你取得成功的机会。
This is your chance to make good.

1306
01:41:50,507 --> 01:41:52,691
当然，你会
Of course, you're going to

1307
01:41:52,715 --> 01:41:54,007
你必须先证明自己。
have to prove yourself first.

1308
01:41:54,382 --> 01:41:56,757
证明自己？证明自己值得。
Prove myself? Prove yourself worthy.

1309
01:41:57,632 --> 01:42:00,590
蒂里，这是绿野仙踪的魔法师。
Tiri, this is the wizard of Oz.

1310
01:42:01,673 --> 01:42:03,816
如果他要满足你心中的设计……
If he's going to grant your heart's design...

1311
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:05,632
但如何证明自己？我……
But prove myself how? I...

1312
01:42:06,174 --> 01:42:07,965
我还没准备好。还太快。
I'm not ready. It's too soon.

1313
01:42:08,382 --> 01:42:12,191
别这么悲观。我也必须证明自己的能力。
Don't be so pessimistic. I too had to prove my powers.

1314
01:42:12,215 --> 01:42:13,507
当我回到巫师身边时，
When I'm back to the wizard,

1315
01:42:14,090 --> 01:42:16,507
你会找到办法的。我相信你。
you'll find a way. I have faith in you.

1316
01:42:21,965 --> 01:42:24,507
不太远。天气是我的专长。
Not too far. Weather is my specialty.

1317
01:42:28,549 --> 01:42:29,549
一定不能让你被淋湿。
Mustn't let you get wet.

1318
01:42:32,465 --> 01:42:40,465
欲知大事因缘，便问之。
Ask when you want the cause of greatness.

1319
01:42:49,507 --> 01:42:53,216
别这么做！
Don't do it!

1320
01:43:16,507 --> 01:43:18,966
登上翡翠城！
For aboard the Emerald City!

1321
01:43:20,341 --> 01:43:22,757
爸爸，这是巴克，就是我在信中提到的那个男孩。
Father, this is Buck, the boy I wrote to you about.

1322
01:43:23,174 --> 01:43:25,591
噢，是的，索普州长。
Oh, yes, Governor Throp.

1323
01:43:26,049 --> 01:43:27,108
很高兴见到你。
Good to meet you.

1324
01:43:27,132 --> 01:43:28,924
嗯，我听说过很多关于你的事。
Well, I've heard so much about you.

1325
01:43:29,424 --> 01:43:32,008
我的 Nessa Rose 对我来说非常珍贵。
My Nessa Rose is very precious to me.

1326
01:43:32,383 --> 01:43:34,549
所以你看，你很照顾她。
So you see, you take good care of her.

1327
01:43:37,091 --> 01:43:38,091
我明白。
I understand.

1328
01:43:39,883 --> 01:43:40,883
好的。
Good.

1329
01:43:42,633 --> 01:43:43,633
艾尔西！
Elsie!

1330
01:43:44,341 --> 01:43:45,049
埃尔西，火车来了。
Elsie, the train is here.

1331
01:43:45,341 --> 01:43:46,984
它的藏匿处还藏有一个可爱的小男人。
And it came with a cute little man up in the stash.

1332
01:43:47,008 --> 01:43:48,008
你一定要见见他。
You've got to see him.

1333
01:43:49,216 --> 01:43:51,049
好吧，你瞧，没有你我们该怎么办？
Well, see, how will we manage without you?

1334
01:43:51,674 --> 01:43:52,834
他甚至不会注意到我已经走了。
He won't even notice I'm gone.

1335
01:43:53,341 --> 01:43:54,341
是的，你有 Fierro。
Yeah, you have Fierro.

1336
01:43:55,424 --> 01:43:57,216
说到菲耶罗，他现在在哪里？
Speaking of Fierro, where is he now?

1337
01:43:57,466 --> 01:43:59,109
我期待他来和我道别，
That I expect him to come and say goodbye,

1338
01:43:59,133 --> 01:44:00,841
但我的意思是，我们几乎不认识彼此。
but I mean, we barely know each other.

1339
01:44:01,133 --> 01:44:02,653
嗯，我几乎也不认识他了。
Well, I barely know him anymore either.

1340
01:44:03,758 --> 01:44:04,758
他已经与众不同了。
He's been different.

1341
01:44:06,466 --> 01:44:08,341
他变得冷漠而又改观了。
He's distant and modified.

1342
01:44:10,133 --> 01:44:14,091
他一直在思考，这确实让我很担心。
And he's been thinking, which really worries me.

1343
01:44:15,091 --> 01:44:17,026
一切都从迪尔曼博士被解雇的那一天开始。
It all started the day Dr. Dillman was fired.

1344
01:44:17,050 --> 01:44:19,175
我的意思是，谁知道他如此关心那只老山羊？
I mean, who knew he cared so much about that old goat?

1345
01:44:20,633 --> 01:44:21,758
瞧，他确实来了。
Look, he did come.

1346
01:44:22,216 --> 01:44:24,758
最亲爱的，我们在这儿，亲爱的。
The dearest, we're over here, darling.

1347
01:44:25,758 --> 01:44:26,758
来。
Come.

1348
01:44:27,091 --> 01:44:28,091
你好。
Hi.

1349
01:44:30,133 --> 01:44:31,234
艾尔法巴。
Elphaba.

1350
01:44:31,258 --> 01:44:32,258
菲耶罗。
Fierro.

1351
01:44:34,133 --> 01:44:35,133
我为你感到高兴。
I'm happy for you.

1352
01:44:35,841 --> 01:44:36,841
谢谢。
Thank you.

1353
01:44:37,383 --> 01:44:40,234
是的，我们都很高兴。
Yes, we are both so happy.

1354
01:44:40,258 --> 01:44:41,258
我一直在思考。
I've been thinking.

1355
01:44:41,508 --> 01:44:42,716
是的，我听说了。
Yeah, I heard.

1356
01:44:43,883 --> 01:44:46,008
关于……青柠杯和迪尔曼博士。
About the... the Lime Cup and Dr. Dillman.

1357
01:44:48,716 --> 01:44:49,836
我经常想起那一天。
I think about that day a lot.

1358
01:44:51,175 --> 01:44:52,175
完全。
Totally.

1359
01:44:59,133 --> 01:45:00,133
噢，我也是。
Oh, me too.

1360
01:45:01,050 --> 01:45:02,133
噢，我也是，我也是。
Oh, me too, me too.

1361
01:45:02,842 --> 01:45:03,092
嗯嗯。
Mm-hmm.

1362
01:45:03,508 --> 01:45:04,633
我一直在思考这个问题。
I think about it constantly.

1363
01:45:05,717 --> 01:45:06,758
我的意思是，可怜的迪尔曼医生。
I mean, poor Dr. Dillman.

1364
01:45:08,383 --> 01:45:10,050
让人不禁想...
It makes one want to...

1365
01:45:12,342 --> 01:45:13,342
采取立场。
to take a stand.

1366
01:45:14,967 --> 01:45:16,425
事实上，对不起。
In fact, excuse me.

1367
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:18,717
请大家注意。
Everyone, please.

1368
01:45:19,508 --> 01:45:20,508
我有一件事情要宣布。
I have an announcement.

1369
01:45:24,925 --> 01:45:27,467
我正在改名。
I am changing my name.

1370
01:45:28,633 --> 01:45:29,633
什么？
What?

1371
01:45:30,342 --> 01:45:30,842
你的名字？
Your name?

1372
01:45:31,342 --> 01:45:31,633
是的。
Yes.

1373
01:45:32,133 --> 01:45:32,675
你确定吗？
Are you sure?

1374
01:45:33,050 --> 01:45:34,151
是的。
Yes.

1375
01:45:34,175 --> 01:45:36,634
由于迪尔曼博士过去有他自己的山羊般的方式
Since Dr. Dillman used to have his own goat-like way

1376
01:45:37,092 --> 01:45:40,050
齐声喊出我的名字
of pronouncing my name in solidarity

1377
01:45:40,675 --> 01:45:43,009
为了表达我的愤慨，
and in order to express my outrage,

1378
01:45:44,009 --> 01:45:47,050
从今以后我将不再是 Gah-Linda。
I will henceforth be no longer as Gah-Linda.

1379
01:45:49,050 --> 01:45:53,717
但简单来说，Gah-Linda。
But simply, Gah-Linda.

1380
01:45:56,925 --> 01:45:57,985
她来到了……
She has come to...

1381
01:45:58,009 --> 01:45:59,110
加琳达。
Gah-Linda.

1382
01:45:59,134 --> 01:46:00,634
真是一辆救护车。
Such a rambulance.

1383
01:46:10,175 --> 01:46:11,175
琳达，你太棒了。
Linda, you're wonderful.

1384
01:46:14,217 --> 01:46:15,217
加琳达。
Gah-Linda.

1385
01:46:28,509 --> 01:46:29,509
祝你好运。
Good luck.

1386
01:46:37,467 --> 01:46:38,467
看？
See?

1387
01:46:39,176 --> 01:46:39,384
那里。
There.

1388
01:46:39,926 --> 01:46:41,860
那...是什么？
What... what is that?

1389
01:46:41,884 --> 01:46:42,985
别难过，Gah-Linda。
Don't be upset, Gah-Linda.

1390
01:46:43,009 --> 01:46:44,110
现在是琳达。
It's Linda now.

1391
01:46:44,134 --> 01:46:44,509
愚蠢的。
Stupid.

1392
01:46:44,926 --> 01:46:45,985
我甚至不知道是什么促使我这么说。
I don't even know what made me say it.

1393
01:46:46,009 --> 01:46:47,235
甚至你的名字是什么都不重要。
It doesn't even matter what your name is.

1394
01:46:47,259 --> 01:46:48,068
每个人都爱你。
Everyone loves you.

1395
01:46:48,092 --> 01:46:49,092
我不在乎。
I don't care.

1396
01:46:49,634 --> 01:46:50,634
我想要他。
I want him.

1397
01:46:51,967 --> 01:46:52,903
我是说，我认为他很完美
I mean, I think he's perfect

1398
01:46:52,927 --> 01:46:54,342
但我还是想要他。
anymore, and I still want him.

1399
01:46:55,342 --> 01:46:57,009
其他人肯定也有同样的感受。
This must be what other people feel like.

1400
01:46:58,634 --> 01:46:59,634
他们如何承受？
How do they bear it?

1401
01:47:01,301 --> 01:47:02,301
全体登机。
All aboard.

1402
01:47:02,634 --> 01:47:03,884
您会拥有一部电影吗？
Will you ever own a movie?

1403
01:47:04,509 --> 01:47:05,509
鬍鬚男。
The Mustache Man.

1404
01:47:36,259 --> 01:47:43,593
哦，等一下。
Oh, wait.

1405
01:47:44,260 --> 01:47:44,510
哦，苏珊。
Oh, Susan.

1406
01:47:44,843 --> 01:47:45,944
哦，苏珊。
Oh, Susan.

1407
01:47:45,968 --> 01:47:46,968
艾尔西，在这里。
Elsie, here.

1408
01:47:47,510 --> 01:47:48,590
我正要把这个给你。
I'm about to give you this.

1409
01:47:49,968 --> 01:47:50,968
再见。
Bye.

1410
01:48:00,468 --> 01:48:01,468
跟我来。
Come with me.

1411
01:48:01,801 --> 01:48:02,218
什么？
What?

1412
01:48:02,718 --> 01:48:03,819
去见巫师。
To meet the wizard.

1413
01:48:03,843 --> 01:48:04,968
你在说什么？
What are you saying?

1414
01:48:05,343 --> 01:48:06,111
噢，火车。
Oh, the train.

1415
01:48:06,135 --> 01:48:07,277
你将会错过它的。
You're going to miss it.

1416
01:48:07,301 --> 01:48:08,069
我可不想这么做。
I couldn't want to.

1417
01:48:08,093 --> 01:48:08,486
我很接近了。
I'm close.

1418
01:48:08,510 --> 01:48:09,569
没关系。
It doesn't matter.

1419
01:48:09,593 --> 01:48:10,569
跟我来就好。
Just come with me.

1420
01:48:10,593 --> 01:48:11,277
为什么不可能呢？
Why couldn't it be?

1421
01:48:11,301 --> 01:48:12,319
这是你的时刻。
This is your moment.

1422
01:48:12,343 --> 01:48:13,343
我來了。
I'm coming.

1423
01:54:37,763 --> 01:54:39,471
巫师现在将会见你。
The wizard will see you now.

1424
01:55:35,097 --> 01:55:36,097
哦。
Oh.

1425
01:56:00,514 --> 01:56:01,514
艾尔夫错了。

1429

01:57:03,847 --> 01:57:04,847

我也是伟大而可怕的。

你是谁？
Who are you?

1433
01:57:13,431 --> 01:57:16,722
你为何来找我？
And why do you seek me?

1434
01:57:17,806 --> 01:57:19,014
艾摩，说点什么。

1435
01:57:20,056 --> 01:57:21,490
我知道我该说什么。

01:57:27,848 --> 01:57:29,389
我的名字是 Elphaba Thraup。

1440
01:57:30,681 --> 01:57:31,681
你是 Oznus？
You're Oznus?

1441
01:57:32,098 --> 01:57:33,098
这是...
And this is...

1442
01:57:33,514 --> 01:57:36,056
谢谢。
Thank you.

1443
01:57:38,723 --> 01:57:39,806
埃尔法巴·特劳普。
Elphaba Thraup.

1444
01:57:40,514 --> 01:57:41,514
一个男人。
A man.

1445
01:57:42,014 --> 01:57:43,014
埃尔法巴·特劳普。

1446
01:57:43,264 --> 01:57:44,264
我不知道那是你。
I didn't know it was you.

1447
01:57:45,139 --> 01:57:46,556
你成功了。

1448
01:57:48,014 --> 01:57:49,324
我很抱歉。

1449
01:57:49,348 --> 01:57:51,014
我不是故意的...

1450
01:57:51,556 --> 01:57:52,556
星光闪耀你。
Starble you.

1451
01:57:54,556 --> 01:57:55,615
你知道，当我回到那里时，我
You know, when I'm back there, I

1452
01:57:55,639 --> 01:57:57,098
看不清人们的脸。
cannot make out people's faces.

1453
01:57:59,098 --> 01:58:00,098
嗯，只是如此...
Well, it's just so...

1454
01:58:01,014 --> 01:58:04,140
很高兴认识你。
It's so great to meet you.

1455
01:58:06,598 --> 01:58:07,657
坚持下去真是太好了。

1456
01:58:07,681 --> 01:58:08,116
那是什么？
What's that?

1457
01:58:08,140 --> 01:58:08,348
什么？
What?

1458
01:58:08,890 --> 01:58:10,098
我很抱歉，可以吗？
I'm so sorry, may I?

1459
01:58:10,515 --> 01:58:10,782
当然，是的。
Sure, yes.

1460
01:58:10,806 --> 01:58:11,074
没关系。
It's OK.

1461
01:58:11,098 --> 01:58:12,098
没关系。
It's OK.

1462
01:58:13,556 --> 01:58:14,556
哦。
Oh.

1463
01:58:15,973 --> 01:58:17,890
献给你，我的特别嘉宾。
For you, my special guest.

1464
01:58:18,515 --> 01:58:19,782
这是给你的纪念品
That's a keepsake for you to

1465
01:58:19,806 --> 01:58:21,098
惜百日。

非常感谢您。
Very kind of you.

1467
01:58:23,390 --> 01:58:24,390
你是奥兹努斯。
You're Oznus.

1468
01:58:24,640 --> 01:58:25,640
谢谢。
Thank you.

1469
01:58:26,515 --> 01:58:29,848
这又是一个意外的惊喜。
This is an additional unexpected.

1470
01:58:30,640 --> 01:58:31,640
你好，你叫什么名字？
Hi, what's your name?

1471
01:58:32,098 --> 01:58:33,098
格伦达。
Glenda.

1472
01:58:34,140 --> 01:58:35,181
那家伙沉默了。
The guy is silent.

1473
01:58:36,140 --> 01:58:37,515
你好，格伦达。
Hello, Glenda.

1474
01:58:38,515 --> 01:58:39,657
你叫什么名字？
What's your name?

1475
01:58:39,681 --> 01:58:40,681
哦，是的。
Oh, yeah.

1476
01:58:41,931 --> 01:58:42,907
嗯，我不知道。
Well, I don't know.

1477
01:58:42,931 --> 01:58:43,931
我觉得有点太多了。
I think it's a bit much.

1478
01:58:44,931 --> 01:58:47,265
但人们已经开始期待这样的事情了。
But folks have come to expect that sort of thing.

1479
01:58:47,723 --> 01:58:52,015
你必须给予人们他们想要的东西。
And you got to give the people what they want.

1480
01:58:53,098 --> 01:58:54,491
我认为... 我认为...
I think... I think...

1481
01:58:54,515 --> 01:58:57,098
但如果你认为这是值得一看的，
But if you think that's something to see,

1482
01:58:57,557 --> 01:58:58,598
拭目以待吧。
wait and see this.

1483
01:58:59,557 --> 01:59:03,140
我把明日的奥兹给你。
I give you the Oz of tomorrow.

1484
01:59:09,557 --> 01:59:10,557
是的。
Yes.

1485
01:59:10,890 --> 01:59:11,890
是的。
Yes.

1486
01:59:13,223 --> 01:59:14,699
现在，我不知道你的眼睛是否已经
Now, I don't know if your eyes have already

1487
01:59:14,723 --> 01:59:17,574
落在这条漫长而曲折的道路上。
fallen upon this long and winding path.

1488
01:59:17,598 --> 01:59:18,783
你看到了吗？
Do you see that?

1489
01:59:18,807 --> 01:59:20,015
我认为人们需要方向。
I think people need direction.

1490
01:59:20,765 --> 01:59:21,491
这东西就建成了。
This thing gets built.

1491
01:59:21,515 --> 01:59:24,949
每个人都会记得，如果你只是
Everybody always is going to remember that if you just

1492
01:59:24,973 --> 01:59:27,515
沿着路走，沿着路走，
follow the road, follow the road,

1493
01:59:27,974 --> 01:59:30,724
它会带你直接找到我。
it's going to lead you right to me.

1494
01:59:32,099 --> 01:59:32,867
最近，我收到了
Recently, I've gotten a

1495
01:59:32,891 --> 01:59:34,241
有点卡住了，想弄清楚
little stuck trying to figure out

1496
01:59:34,265 --> 01:59:36,265
那条路的砖应该是什么颜色。
what color the bricks of that road ought to be.

1497
01:59:36,724 --> 01:59:40,890
所以我临时把这个东西弄了起来，它可以完成这个任务。
So I jerryrigged this thing up, which does that.

1498
01:59:41,224 --> 01:59:41,432
哦。
Oh.

1499
01:59:42,099 --> 01:59:44,765
是的，阿尔法，你尝试一下。
Yeah, Alpha, you give that a whirl.

1500
01:59:45,182 --> 01:59:45,432
当然。
Sure.

1501
01:59:45,765 --> 01:59:46,765
我们来尝试一下。
And let's try.

1502
01:59:49,765 --> 01:59:51,182
噢，现在，绿色。
Oh, now, green.

1503
01:59:52,099 --> 01:59:53,099
唔。
Hmm.

1504
01:59:54,265 --> 01:59:57,349
黄色，也许是紫色。
Yellow, maybe purple.

1505
01:59:58,515 --> 02:00:01,015
等一下，请返回上一级。
Wait, just go back one, please.

1506
02:00:01,307 --> 02:00:02,491
真的是黄色吗？
The yellow, really?

1507
02:00:02,515 --> 02:00:03,515
是的。
Yes.

1508
02:00:04,557 --> 02:00:05,682
它只是对我而言是一条路。
It just says road to me.

1509
02:00:06,099 --> 02:00:07,099
让我看看。
Let me see.

1510
02:00:07,515 --> 02:00:07,682
嗯。
Huh.

1511
02:00:08,516 --> 02:00:11,016
还有...哦，随意走吧。
And... oh, feel free road.

1512
02:00:12,516 --> 02:00:13,516
我不知道。
I don't know.

1513
02:00:13,807 --> 02:00:15,492
哦，嘿，上来吧。
Oh, hey, come up here.

1514
02:00:15,516 --> 02:00:18,349
和我一起来到我的沙箱里。
Come up here with me in my sandbox.

1515
02:00:18,849 --> 02:00:19,516
快上前。
Step right up.

1516
02:00:19,807 --> 02:00:20,408
看这个。
Watch this.

1517
02:00:20,432 --> 02:00:21,516
这就是我们现在的状况。
So here's where we are.

1518
02:00:22,307 --> 02:00:24,849
当我们打开它的内部时……
And when we open it up inside...

1519
02:00:26,557 --> 02:00:26,974
那就是你。
That's you.

1520
02:00:27,516 --> 02:00:28,516
嗯，是我。
Well, it is me.

1521
02:00:28,849 --> 02:00:29,849
是的，是我。
Yeah, it is me.

1522
02:00:30,391 --> 02:00:31,391
我不应该。
I shouldn't.

1523
02:00:31,766 --> 02:00:33,117
我经常独自一人来这里。
I'm here by myself a lot.

1524
02:00:33,141 --> 02:00:34,141
反正我不...
Anyway, I don't...

1525
02:00:34,391 --> 02:00:35,391
哦。
Oh.

1526
02:00:36,099 --> 02:00:37,158
我的上帝。
My god.

1527
02:00:37,182 --> 02:00:38,724
如果我的头没有连在上面，
If my head wasn't attached to it,

1528
02:00:39,266 --> 02:00:41,807
我会把它留在一堆土地上。
I'd leave it in a bunch of land.

1529
02:00:42,224 --> 02:00:43,450
嘿，你知道我做了什么吗？
Hey, you know what I had made?

1530
02:00:43,474 --> 02:00:44,474
看看，很特别。
Look, special.

1531
02:00:48,557 --> 02:00:49,557
保留它。
Keep that.

1532
02:00:49,807 --> 02:00:51,075
我知道，我是认真的。
I know, I mean it.

1533
02:00:51,099 --> 02:00:52,099
永远保留它。
Keep it forever.

1534
02:00:52,433 --> 02:00:55,325
因为在某种程度上，谁知道呢？
Because at some point, who knows?

1535
02:00:55,349 --> 02:00:58,367
我们可能会把你的小文物放在那里
We might be putting your little artifact in there

1536
02:00:58,391 --> 02:01:00,141
就在我的旁边。
right next to mine.

1537
02:01:00,558 --> 02:01:02,242
因为也许有一天你会打电话
Because maybe someday you're going to be calling

1538
02:01:02,266 --> 02:01:05,349
这整堆石头都是你的家。
this whole pile of stones your home.

1539
02:01:09,183 --> 02:01:10,183
阿尔菲。
Alfie.

1540
02:01:11,724 --> 02:01:12,974
她是绿色的。
She's green.

1541
02:01:14,516 --> 02:01:15,516
那好吧。
Oh, well.

1542
02:01:15,974 --> 02:01:16,974
她没必要这样。
She doesn't have to be.

1543
02:01:17,849 --> 02:01:20,349
这会是你内心的渴望吗？
Would that be your heart's desire?

1544
02:01:30,516 --> 02:01:31,516
不。
No.

1545
02:01:35,516 --> 02:01:36,516
不。
No.

1546
02:01:38,683 --> 02:01:40,603
我真心希望你能帮助这些动物。
My heart's desire is for you to help the animals.

1547
02:01:41,766 --> 02:01:43,886
他们遇到了一些不好的事情，他们需要你。
Something bad is happening to them, and they need you.

1548
02:01:44,516 --> 02:01:46,808
我有预感你会这么说。
I had a feeling you were going to say that.

1549
02:01:47,350 --> 02:01:48,808
我完全同意。
And I agree wholeheartedly.

1550
02:01:49,475 --> 02:01:49,850
是的。
Yeah.

1551
02:01:50,141 --> 02:01:51,266
哇，这真是最糟糕的事情。
Wow, it's the darndest thing.

1552
02:01:51,641 --> 02:01:53,391
这几乎就像我，呃……
It's almost like I, uh...

1553
02:01:53,808 --> 02:01:55,266
我已经认识你了。
I already know you.

1554
02:01:56,850 --> 02:01:57,850
我知道你会理解的。
I knew you'd understand.

1555
02:01:59,183 --> 02:02:01,266
这让我... 非常高兴。
That makes me... that makes me so happy.

1556
02:02:01,933 --> 02:02:05,808
嗯，这就是我最好的样子，让人们开心。
Well, that's what I look best, making people happy.

1557
02:02:09,141 --> 02:02:12,534
我是一个感性的人
I am a sentimental man who

1558
02:02:12,558 --> 02:02:16,683
一直渴望有一位父亲。
always longed to need a father.

1559
02:02:18,225 --> 02:02:20,909
这就是为什么我尽我所能
That's why I do the best I

1560
02:02:20,933 --> 02:02:25,034
能够善待我们每一个公民
can to treat each citizen of us

1561
02:02:25,058 --> 02:02:28,975
作为儿子或女儿。
as son or daughter.

1562
02:02:30,892 --> 02:02:34,767
所以，埃尔法巴，我想把你捧得更高。
So, Elphaba, I'd like to raise you high.

1563
02:02:35,517 --> 02:02:42,267
因为我认为每个人都应该有飞翔的机会。
Because I think everyone deserves the chance to fly.

1564
02:02:47,517 --> 02:02:50,868
并帮助你
And helping you with your

1565
02:02:50,892 --> 02:02:58,309
上升让我感受到父母般的关怀。
ascent allows me to feel so parental.

1566
02:03:02,517 --> 02:03:10,517
因为我是一个感情丰富的人。
For I am a sentimental man.

1567
02:03:42,517 --> 02:03:46,434
谢谢。
Thank you.

1568
02:03:46,809 --> 02:03:46,910
谢谢。
Thank you.

1569
02:03:46,934 --> 02:03:47,934
我们就此打住。
Let's just after that.

1570
02:03:48,517 --> 02:03:49,660
好的。
Okay.

1571
02:03:49,684 --> 02:03:51,101
呃，那些女人在哪儿？
Uh, where were the women?

1572
02:03:52,517 --> 02:03:53,851
那是……
Is that...

1573
02:03:56,184 --> 02:03:57,184
这是。
It is.

1574
02:03:58,517 --> 02:04:00,851
奥博夫人，您在这里做什么？
Madame Orbeau, what are you doing here?

1575
02:04:01,892 --> 02:04:02,892
哦亲爱的。
Oh dear.

1576
02:04:03,976 --> 02:04:06,142
我可能会错过你的重要时刻。
I could miss you a big moment.

1577
02:04:09,267 --> 02:04:13,726
我看你也做不到。
Neither could you, I see.

1578
02:04:21,643 --> 02:04:29,184
我不相信……这就是魔咒吗？
I don't believe... is that the grimory?

1579
02:04:30,893 --> 02:04:31,893
是的。
Yes.

1580
02:04:33,268 --> 02:04:34,285
这是一本古老的书
That's the ancient book of

1581
02:04:34,309 --> 02:04:37,434
智慧、神奇力量和机器人。
wisdom, thaumaturgy, and androids.

1582
02:04:47,393 --> 02:04:50,893
我可以摸一下嗎？
Can I touch it?

1583
02:04:52,518 --> 02:04:52,976
不。
No.

1584
02:04:53,518 --> 02:04:54,518
不。
No.

1585
02:04:55,768 --> 02:04:56,976
等一下，等一下。
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1586
02:04:57,518 --> 02:04:58,559
她可能还没有准备好。
She may not be ready.

1587
02:04:59,518 --> 02:05:01,601
用魔咒施展咒语。
Cast a spell with the grimory.

1588
02:05:02,226 --> 02:05:03,351
这是一个极其艰巨的任务。
That's a mighty tall order.

1589
02:05:04,643 --> 02:05:05,643
我应该知道。
I should know.

1590
02:05:06,518 --> 02:05:08,286
但是，俄罗斯女王马萨，也许
But, Queen Massa Russia, perhaps

1591
02:05:08,310 --> 02:05:09,726
今天太让人受不了了。
today has been too overwhelming.

1592
02:05:10,101 --> 02:05:11,101
不。
No.

1593
02:05:11,643 --> 02:05:12,643
请。
Please.

1594
02:05:13,643 --> 02:05:14,643
让我试试。
Let me try.

1595
02:05:15,935 --> 02:05:16,935
让我证明我自己。
Let me prove myself.

1596
02:05:34,726 --> 02:05:35,726
亲爱的。
Sweetheart.

1597
02:05:44,518 --> 02:05:45,685
我必须敞开心扉。
I had to open for heart.

1598
02:05:59,518 --> 02:06:01,685
那么你要从哪个咒语开始呢？
So which spell are you going to start with?

1599
02:06:02,643 --> 02:06:04,102
我们一直在研究悬浮技术。
We've been working on levitation.

1600
02:06:05,518 --> 02:06:06,518
悬浮？
Levitation?

1601
02:06:06,852 --> 02:06:08,602
哦，那很有趣。
Oh, that's interesting.

1602
02:06:09,518 --> 02:06:12,227
你知道 Chistri 在这儿，
You know that Chistri here,

1603
02:06:13,352 --> 02:06:16,143
女士们，你们见过 Chistri 吗？
have you ladies met Chistri?

1604
02:06:16,518 --> 02:06:18,685
我的翡翠卫队的领袖。
The leader of my Emerald Guards.

1605
02:06:19,477 --> 02:06:20,477
很高兴认识你。
Pleased to meet you.

1606
02:06:21,518 --> 02:06:22,518
他不愿意承认这一点。
He'd hate to admit this.

1607
02:06:22,852 --> 02:06:24,394
他不喜欢谈论自己。
He does not like talking about himself.

1608
02:06:25,144 --> 02:06:30,935
但他每天早晨都会渴望地观察鸟儿。
But he watches birds so longingly every morning.

1609
02:06:32,519 --> 02:06:33,519
鸟类。
Birds.

1610
02:06:35,102 --> 02:06:36,102
我该如何帮助他？
How could I help him?

1611
02:06:36,519 --> 02:06:37,519
救命啊，海拉。
Help, Hila.

1612
02:06:44,519 --> 02:06:45,644
那些是鸟吗？
Are those birds?

1613
02:06:49,227 --> 02:06:50,227
失去了语言。
Lost language.

1614
02:06:51,269 --> 02:06:52,935
我们失传的咒语语言。
Our lost language of spells.

1615
02:06:54,310 --> 02:06:57,602
如果你无法理解，不要灰心。
Don't be discouraged if you can't decipher it.

1616
02:06:58,644 --> 02:07:01,286
亲爱的，我自己只能读
Dear, I myself can only read a

1617
02:07:01,310 --> 02:07:03,477
一两个字，这需要数年的时间。
word or two, and that took years.

1618
02:07:09,977 --> 02:07:10,977
哦，海拉。
Oh, Hila.

1619
02:07:24,602 --> 02:07:32,227
我告诉你什么了？
What did I tell you?

1620
02:07:46,978 --> 02:07:48,058
Chistri，你还好吗？
Chistri, are you all right?

1621
02:07:48,519 --> 02:07:49,519
奇斯特里。
Chistri.

1622
02:07:52,519 --> 02:07:54,936
这只是一种过渡，亲爱的。
It's just a transition, dearie.

1623
02:07:55,186 --> 02:07:56,311
这只是一个过渡。
It's just a transition.

1624
02:08:11,978 --> 02:08:13,603
但这会伤害你。
But it's hurting you.

1625
02:08:14,853 --> 02:08:15,853
奇斯特里。
Chistri.

1626
02:08:47,895 --> 02:08:51,436
你做到了。你确实做到了。
You did it. You actually did it.

1627
02:09:02,936 --> 02:09:05,478
他很痛苦。快说，我该如何缓解？
He's in pain. Quick, how do I reverse it?

1628
02:09:06,020 --> 02:09:06,412
撤销？
Reverse?

1629
02:09:06,436 --> 02:09:07,436
我该如何扭转这种局面？
How do I reverse it?

1630
02:09:07,728 --> 02:09:10,395
格里玛瑞咒语是不可逆转的。
A spell from the Grimary can never be reversed.

1631
02:09:15,562 --> 02:09:17,520
阿尔法栏。阿尔法栏。
Alpha-bar. Alpha-bar.

1632
02:09:17,812 --> 02:09:18,812
不，很少。
No. Little.

1633
02:09:35,895 --> 02:09:39,228
我知道她有这个能力。我告诉过你。
I knew she had the power. I told you.

1634
02:09:39,603 --> 02:09:41,454
阿尔菲，这是眼睛的声音。
Alfie, this is a sound of eyes.

1635
02:09:41,478 --> 02:09:43,270
她将回家观察天空。
She's gonna be home for eyes of the skies.

1636
02:09:43,687 --> 02:09:45,895
是的。他们非常适合当间谍。
Yes. They'll make perfect as spies.

1637
02:09:47,103 --> 02:09:48,103
间谍？
Spies?

1638
02:09:49,728 --> 02:09:51,103
阿尔法栏。阿尔法栏。
Alpha-bar. Alpha-bar.

1639
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:54,104
阿尔菲？阿尔菲？
Alfie? Alfie?

1640
02:09:56,520 --> 02:09:58,705
你说得对。这句话太刺耳了。哦，侦察兵。
You're right. That's a very harsh word. Oh, scouts.

1641
02:09:58,729 --> 02:10:00,538
那侦察兵呢？因为他们会飞到
What about scouts? Because they'll be flying around to

1642
02:10:00,562 --> 02:10:02,871
奥兹汇报了一起新的煽动性动物活动。
Oz reporting back on a new seditious animal activity.

1643
02:10:02,895 --> 02:10:04,621
煽动性动物行为？这是什么意思？
Seditious animal activity? What does that mean?

1644
02:10:04,645 --> 02:10:07,395
阿尔菲？我相信巫师一定有充分的理由。
Alfie? I'm sure the wizard has a good reason.

1645
02:10:12,187 --> 02:10:13,187
是你。
It's you.

1646
02:10:14,812 --> 02:10:15,852
这一切都是你造成的。
You're behind all of this.

1647
02:10:17,687 --> 02:10:18,414
你是人们
You're the reason why people

1648
02:10:18,438 --> 02:10:19,496
正在与动物作对。
are turning against the animals.

1649
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:21,020
这一切都是因为你。
It's all because of you.

1650
02:10:22,812 --> 02:10:23,830
我们这样做是为了保持
We're doing this to keep

1651
02:10:23,854 --> 02:10:26,270
人民安全。我们所有人都会受益。
people safe. All of us will benefit.

1652
02:10:27,187 --> 02:10:28,479
而你一直都知道。
And you've known all along.

1653
02:10:30,437 --> 02:10:33,896
从你遇见我的那天起，你也会受益匪浅，杰瑞。
Since the day you met me, you will benefit too, Jerry.

1654
02:10:34,812 --> 02:10:36,604
你必须相信我。别这样！别这样！
You must trust me. Don't! Don't!

1655
02:10:37,062 --> 02:10:41,812
阿尔菲，我第一次到这里时，这里一片混乱。
Alfie, when I first got here, there was discord.

1656
02:10:42,521 --> 02:10:44,497
有不满情绪。而在我的家乡，
There was discontent. And back where I come from,

1657
02:10:44,521 --> 02:10:48,913
大家都知道，最好的办法是
everybody knows that the best way to bring folks

1658
02:10:48,937 --> 02:10:53,312
就是给他们一个真正的好敌人。
together is to give them a real good enemy.

1659
02:10:55,021 --> 02:10:56,413
如果你想要间谍，为什么
If you wanted spies, why

1660
02:10:56,437 --> 02:10:59,062
你不会自己做吗？
wouldn't you just make them yourself?

1661
02:10:59,521 --> 02:11:00,521
我不知道。
I don't know.

1662
02:11:08,937 --> 02:11:09,937
阿尔法巴！
Alphaba!

1663
02:11:11,521 --> 02:11:14,521
Alphaba！你正在和绿野仙踪的魔法师交谈！
Alphaba! You are talking to the Wizard of Oz!

1664
02:11:17,979 --> 02:11:21,396
阅读它！施展魔法！阅读它！
Read it! Cast a spell! Read it!

1665
02:11:22,521 --> 02:11:23,521
不！
Don't!

1666
02:11:28,646 --> 02:11:33,229
你不能，是吗？你能吗？
You can't, can you? Can you?

1667
02:11:40,688 --> 02:11:42,021
这就是为什么你需要这一切！
That's why you need all of this!

1668
02:11:42,438 --> 02:11:45,938
你需要间谍、动物、笼子和敌人！
And you need spies and animals and cages and an enemy!

1669
02:11:46,188 --> 02:11:48,688
您没有真正的文件！
You have no real paperwork!

1670
02:11:49,979 --> 02:11:52,479
没错。这就是我需要你的原因。
Exactly. That's why I need you.

1671
02:11:53,521 --> 02:11:56,604
想想你的未来吧，亲爱的我。
Think of your future, dear me.

1672
02:11:57,188 --> 02:11:58,188
退后！
Stay back!

1673
02:12:01,146 --> 02:12:05,021
阿尔菲，求你听听他们的意见。
Alfie, listen to them. Please.

1674
02:12:06,521 --> 02:12:10,081
好建议，小姑娘。听着，阿尔法巴，如果你能
Good advice, young lady. Listen, Alphaba, if you can

1675
02:12:10,105 --> 02:12:13,980
将其拉下，首先将其从盒子中取出。
pull this off, first crack out of the box.

1676
02:12:14,855 --> 02:12:19,372
天哪。我简直无法想象。我说的每一句话都是真心的
Oh my God. I can't even imagine. And I meant every word

1677
02:12:19,396 --> 02:12:21,497
你在这里有一个家。
about you having a home here.

1678
02:12:21,521 --> 02:12:26,664
就只有你和我了，嘿，如​​果这能让你
It's gonna be you and me, and hey, if it'd make you

1679
02:12:26,688 --> 02:12:30,105
很高兴，可能是你的朋友。
happy, possibly your friend.

1680
02:12:30,813 --> 02:12:31,813
真的吗？
Really?

1681
02:12:33,105 --> 02:12:34,105
为什么不呢？
Why not?

1682
02:12:36,105 --> 02:12:37,105
不！
No!

1683
02:12:39,772 --> 02:12:40,772
阿尔法巴！
Alphaba!

1684
02:12:41,522 --> 02:12:44,188
你对自己这么好，那就回报一些吧。
You wanted yourself so good, get some back.

1685
02:12:47,522 --> 02:12:49,438
阿尔菲！阿尔菲！
Alfie! Alfie!

1686
02:12:51,522 --> 02:12:52,522
阿尔菲！
Alfie!

1687
02:12:56,522 --> 02:12:57,522
听！
Listen!

1688
02:13:02,522 --> 02:13:03,522
听！
Listen!

1689
02:13:04,980 --> 02:13:06,664
如果你想保住你的家人
If you want to keep your family

1690
02:13:06,688 --> 02:13:10,605
安全，你就会忠诚于我们的巫师。
safe, you'll stay loyal to our Wizard.

1691
02:13:11,647 --> 02:13:16,272
她干的！绿色的！别让她逃走！
She did this! The green one! Don't let her get away!

1692
02:13:56,730 --> 02:13:57,730
阿尔菲！
Alfie!

1693
02:14:03,522 --> 02:14:06,522
阿尔菲，你要去哪里？阿尔菲，你在做什么？
Alfie, where are you going? Alfie, what are you doing?

1694
02:14:08,647 --> 02:14:09,647
不！
No!

1695
02:14:10,522 --> 02:14:11,415
阿尔法巴，请回来吧。
Alfaba, please, come back.

1696
02:14:11,439 --> 02:14:12,719
我们就和他们聊聊吧。
Let's just have a word with them.

1697
02:14:13,522 --> 02:14:15,814
阿尔菲，你在做什么？
Alfie, what are you doing?

1698
02:14:21,522 --> 02:14:22,522
阿尔菲！
Alfie!

1699
02:14:25,856 --> 02:14:33,856
阿尔菲！
Alfie!

1700
02:14:36,981 --> 02:14:43,272
警卫。警卫。
Guards. Guards.

1701
02:14:45,523 --> 02:14:50,023
守卫们，作为一个逃犯，在宫殿里听到，
Guards, as a fugitive, at large, hear in the palace,

1702
02:14:50,523 --> 02:14:55,832
把她带给我。
bring her to me.

1703
02:14:55,856 --> 02:15:02,540
阿尔法巴，你在做什么？
Alfaba, what are you doing?

1704
02:15:02,564 --> 02:15:03,333
跟我来！跟我来！
Follow me! Follow me!

1705
02:15:03,357 --> 02:15:05,273
你在哪？你到底是什么？疯了！
Where? What are you? Out of your mind!

1706
02:15:06,439 --> 02:15:07,499
天哪，阿尔法巴，你太荒唐了。
Goodness, Alfaba, you're being ridiculous.

1707
02:15:07,523 --> 02:15:08,665
来吧！
Just come on!

1708
02:15:08,689 --> 02:15:09,689
你要去哪儿？

1709
02:15:13,106 --> 02:15:16,314
抓住她！

1710
02:15:16,689 --> 02:15:17,689
带我过去！

02:15:25,648 --> 02:15:25,940
跳！
Jump!

1715
02:15:26,606 --> 02:15:27,606
尼日利亚！
Naija!

1716
02:15:28,315 --> 02:15:28,523
跳！
Jump!

1717
02:15:29,065 --> 02:15:30,065
跳！现在！
Jump! Now!

1718
02:15:31,273 --> 02:15:32,273
加油，尼日利亚！
Come on, Naija!

1719
02:15:32,606 --> 02:15:33,606
加油，尼日利亚！

1720
02:15:33,898 --> 02:15:36,457
快点！

1721
02:15:36,481 --> 02:15:41,690
加油！加油！
Come on! Come on!

1722
02:15:45,523 --> 02:15:47,273
让我坚持我的路线。
Keep me in my way.

1723
02:15:48,523 --> 02:15:49,523
保佑我坚强！
Keep me in strength!

1724
02:16:13,107 --> 02:16:14,398
移动！
Move!

1725
02:16:18,732 --> 02:16:20,607
嘿！不！
Hey! No!

1726
02:16:26,523 --> 02:16:28,023
噢，不，不。
Oh, no, no.

1727
02:16:30,773 --> 02:16:31,857
阿尔菲，阿尔菲，救救我。
Alfie, Alfie, help me.

1728
02:16:33,523 --> 02:16:35,023
快点！小心！
Faster! Look out!

1729
02:16:40,357 --> 02:16:46,982
快！下车！
Quick! Get off!

1730
02:16:57,815 --> 02:17:00,500
这不太好。
This is not good.

1731
02:17:00,524 --> 02:17:01,875
这不太好。
This is not good.

1732
02:17:01,899 --> 02:17:02,524
这不太好。
This is not good.

1733
02:17:02,857 --> 02:17:03,857
阿尔菲！
Alfie!

1734
02:17:04,440 --> 02:17:05,440
阿尔菲！
Alfie!

1735
02:17:05,774 --> 02:17:06,833
冷静下来！
Calm down!

1736
02:17:06,857 --> 02:17:08,208
你得让他解释。
You have got to let him explain.

1737
02:17:08,232 --> 02:17:09,232
从我的尸体上跨过去。
Over my dead body.

1738
02:17:09,940 --> 02:17:12,649
这就是您梦想的一切！
This is everything you've dreamed of!

1739
02:17:18,524 --> 02:17:21,815
Alfaba，这比我们大得多。
Alfaba, this is so much bigger than us.

1740
02:17:22,399 --> 02:17:24,024
为什么你能保持冷静一次，
Why can you stay calm for once,

1741
02:17:24,274 --> 02:17:25,690
而不是勃然大怒？
instead of flying off the handle?

1742
02:17:26,232 --> 02:17:27,232
我希望你快乐。
I hope you're happy.

1743
02:17:27,524 --> 02:17:28,500
我希望你现在很快乐。
I hope you're happy now.

1744
02:17:28,524 --> 02:17:31,833
我希望你能对自己永远伤害的事业感到高兴。
I hope you're happy how you've hurt your cause forever.

1745
02:17:31,857 --> 02:17:33,774
我希望你认为自己很聪明。
I hope you think you're clever.

1746
02:17:34,524 --> 02:17:35,625
我希望你快乐。
I hope you're happy.

1747
02:17:35,649 --> 02:17:36,899
我也希望你开心。
I hope you're happy too.

1748
02:17:37,274 --> 02:17:40,667
我希望你为自己卑躬屈膝而感到自豪
I hope you're proud how you would grovel in submission

1749
02:17:40,691 --> 02:17:42,607
以满足自己的野心。
to feed your own ambition.

1750
02:17:43,524 --> 02:17:46,941
所以，我无法想象。
So, I can't imagine how.

1751
02:17:47,941 --> 02:17:50,066
我希望你快乐。
I hope you're happy.

1752
02:17:50,774 --> 02:17:54,691
现在。
Right now.

1753
02:17:56,024 --> 02:17:57,024
我们的公民。
Citizens of us.

1754
02:17:57,524 --> 02:18:03,149
有一个敌人必须被找到并捕获。
There is an enemy who must be found and captured.

1755
02:18:03,899 --> 02:18:06,107
她说，什么都不要相信。
Believe in nothing, she says.

1756
02:18:07,774 --> 02:18:10,024
她偷走了我们的魔法书。
She has stolen our grimory.

1757
02:18:11,149 --> 02:18:12,816
她很邪恶。
She is evil.

1758
02:18:14,191 --> 02:18:15,542
负责残害
Responsible for the mutilation

1759
02:18:15,566 --> 02:18:18,774
这些可怜的、无辜的猴子。
of these poor, innocent monkeys.

1760
02:18:20,983 --> 02:18:25,524
她的绿色皮肤只是外在的表现。
Her green skin is but an outward manifestation.

1761
02:18:26,524 --> 02:18:28,983
性格扭曲。
Of a twisted nature.

1762
02:18:31,274 --> 02:18:32,733
这种扭曲。
This distortion.

1763
02:18:33,899 --> 02:18:35,649
这种排斥。
This repulsion.

1764
02:18:36,816 --> 02:18:37,816
这...
This...

1765
02:18:40,149 --> 02:18:41,524
维根姑娘。
Wigan wench.

1766
02:18:57,525 --> 02:18:59,691
别害怕。
Don't be afraid.

1767
02:19:02,691 --> 02:19:03,691
我不害怕。
I'm not afraid.

1768
02:19:06,650 --> 02:19:08,900
巫师才应该怕我。
It's the wizard who should be afraid of me.

1769
02:19:09,441 --> 02:19:10,441
嘿。
Hey.

1770
02:19:12,775 --> 02:19:13,775
现在，听我说。

1771
02:19:14,566 --> 02:19:15,566
听我说，只是...
Listen to me, just...

1772
02:19:16,108 --> 02:19:17,108
只要说声对不起就可以了。
Just say you're sorry.

1773
02:19:19,150 --> 02:19:22,483
你仍然可以和巫师在一起
You can still be with the wizard

1774
02:19:23,525 --> 02:19:24,900
一旦你工作了。
once you've worked.

1775
02:19:37,525 --> 02:19:38,525
我知道。
I know.

1776
02:19:41,192 --> 02:19:43,275
但我并不想这样。
But I don't want it.

1777
02:19:45,067 --> 02:19:46,067
不。
No.

1778
02:19:47,442 --> 02:19:50,483
我不可能想要它。
I can't want it.

1779
02:19:51,525 --> 02:19:58,400
再也没有了。
Anymore.

1780
02:20:03,525 --> 02:20:09,317
我内心已​​经发生了一些变化。
Something has changed within me.

1781
02:20:11,067 --> 02:20:13,483
有些事情已经不一样了。
Something is not the same.

1782
02:20:14,525 --> 02:20:19,442
我正在快速地玩着。
I'm swiftly playing by.

1783
02:20:20,567 --> 02:20:24,317
别人的游戏规则。
Rules of someone else's game.

1784
02:20:26,359 --> 02:20:28,650
事后猜测已经太晚了。
Too late for second guessing.

1785
02:20:30,109 --> 02:20:34,109
回去睡觉已经太晚了。
Too late to go back to sleep.

1786
02:20:35,275 --> 02:20:38,650
现在该相信我的直觉了。
It's time to trust my instincts.

1787
02:20:39,900 --> 02:20:41,525
閉上我的眼睛。
Close my eyes.

1788
02:20:46,067 --> 02:20:47,192
然后离开。
And leave.

1789
02:20:48,734 --> 02:20:54,025
是时候尝试克服重力了。
It's time to try defying gravity.

1790
02:20:54,775 --> 02:21:00,359
我想我会尝试克服重力。
I think I'll try defying gravity.

1791
02:21:00,734 --> 02:21:03,317
你也无法把我拉下水。
And you can't pull me down.

1792
02:21:04,276 --> 02:21:06,067
难道我还不能让你明白吗？
Can't I make you understand?

1793
02:21:06,526 --> 02:21:08,859
你有妄自尊大的想法。
You're having delusions of grandeur.

1794
02:21:09,442 --> 02:21:11,484
我非常接受自由主义。
I'm so accepting libous.

1795
02:21:12,526 --> 02:21:14,692
因为有人说他们是如此。
Cause someone says they're so.

1796
02:21:15,651 --> 02:21:17,984
有些事我无法改变。
Some things I cannot change.

1797
02:21:18,526 --> 02:21:21,567
如果不尝试我永远不会知道。
Until I try I'll never know.

1798
02:21:22,026 --> 02:21:25,043
我害怕得太久了。
Too long I've been afraid of.

1799
02:21:25,067 --> 02:21:28,026
失去了爱我想我已经失败了。
Losing love I guess I've lost.

1800
02:21:28,526 --> 02:21:30,377
好吧，如果失去了它，
Well if that's lost, it

1801
02:21:30,401 --> 02:21:34,567
成本变得太高了。
becomes at much too high a cost.

1802
02:21:35,067 --> 02:21:40,109
我会通过抵抗重力而生存下来。
I'd survive by defying gravity.

1803
02:21:41,443 --> 02:21:46,693
好好地吻我，克服地心引力。
Kiss me good and defying gravity.

1804
02:21:47,276 --> 02:21:51,443
你也无法把我拉下水。
And you can't pull me down.

1805
02:21:52,109 --> 02:21:59,443
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

1806
02:22:00,193 --> 02:22:01,193
请帮助他们。
Help them up please.

1807
02:22:02,609 --> 02:22:03,609
听我说完就停下来。
Listen to me stop.

1808
02:22:05,609 --> 02:22:06,710
阿帕塔卡。
Appantaka.

1809
02:22:06,734 --> 02:22:07,502
阿潘塔卡不是。
Appantaka not.

1810
02:22:07,526 --> 02:22:10,026
并不是那种可怕的悬浮呼叫完成。
Not that hideous levitation call of complete.

1811
02:22:10,818 --> 02:22:12,778
请你不要介意，你不知道自己在做什么。

1812
02:22:13,526 --> 02:22:14,669
停止。

1813
02:22:14,693 --> 02:22:14,943

出色地。
Well.

1816
02:22:26,526 --> 02:22:27,818
你为什么醒了？
Why are you awake?

1817
02:22:32,193 --> 02:22:34,153
或许你并没有你想象的那么强大。
Maybe you're not as powerful as you think you are.

1818
02:22:48,526 --> 02:22:49,693
亲爱的。
Sweetheart.

1819
02:23:41,527 --> 02:23:42,818
迅速地。
Quickly.

1820
02:23:44,443 --> 02:23:45,443
进行。

1821
02:23:45,819 --> 02:23:46,819

02:23:50,527 --> 02:23:52,152
跟我来。
Come with me.

1823
02:23:53,069 --> 02:23:54,652
想想我们能做什么。

团结一心，无限可能。

02:24:07,527 --> 02:24:12,753
我们将共同成为史上最伟大的团队。

1828

沿着梦想之路不断攀登。
Going on dreams the way we climb above.

1829
02:24:18,235 --> 02:24:20,777
如果我们在时间门内工作，
If we work in time door,

1830
02:24:21,235 --> 02:24:25,444
没有我们无法赢得的战斗。

1831
02:24:26,402 --> 02:24:29,152
只有你和我。

克服重力。
Defying gravity.

1833
02:24:32,527 --> 02:24:35,611
我们赢了，我也赢了。

1834
02:24:35,861 --> 02:24:38,861
克服重力。
Defying gravity.

1835
02:24:39,444 --> 02:24:43,027
这绝不会让我们失望。

1836
02:24:47,527 --> 02:24:48,527
你要來嗎？
Are you coming?

1837
02:25:25,986 --> 02:25:26,153
不，你在发抖。

这里。

我希望你快乐。

既然你们两个选择了这个。

我希望它能给你带来幸福。

那么你就不会后悔。

我希望你最后能够幸福。

我希望你幸福，我的朋友。

别去。

1848
02:27:13,862 --> 02:27:15,154
不，我们都是...

1849
02:27:15,529 --> 02:27:16,546
你什么都没做。
You haven't done anything.

1850
02:27:16,570 --> 02:27:17,570

What?

02:27:18,820 --> 02:27:19,820
帮我。

1852

我不知道他赢了什么。
I don't know what he won.

1853
