1
00:00:25,164 --> 00:00:27,975
Vilmos, before we sit down,

2
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,810
I'd like to show you
the frame and the light.

3
00:00:30,965 --> 00:00:35,535
I put a 35 mm
as a focal length.

4
00:00:37,226 --> 00:00:37,960
Like this.

5
00:00:38,254 --> 00:00:39,264
All right. All right, all right.

6
00:00:39,711 --> 00:00:42,306
We use a Softbox

7
00:00:42,774 --> 00:00:45,784
with a broadcast on it.

8
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,318
The place is inconvenient.

9
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,240
I've been thinking about that kind of contrast.
Is it open?

10
00:00:52,307 --> 00:00:56,544
With something like this,
by placing the subject to one side.

11
00:00:56,824 --> 00:00:59,871
Do you prefer
that we take the projector out of the frame?

12
00:00:59,936 --> 00:01:02,872
No,
you can leave it in the plan.

13
00:01:04,056 --> 00:01:07,239
Would you like to see
how does that look on the screen?

14
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,960
That's a good idea.

15
00:01:13,318 --> 00:01:14,916
Lower the camera, it will be better.

16
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,249
What do you think of the backlighting?

17
00:01:20,418 --> 00:01:24,362
Sometimes the sun shines
the back of a face.

18
00:01:25,804 --> 00:01:29,354
I like the backlighting
but you mustn't overdo it.

19
00:01:29,534 --> 00:01:30,800
Let's turn it off for a second.

20
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:36,709
It's off.

21
00:01:37,121 --> 00:01:40,080
Yes, but it's much worse.

22
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,789
You have to be able to draw the silhouette.

23
00:01:43,557 --> 00:01:48,200
- Turn Nathan back on.
- Except with a subject in the dark.

24
00:01:53,395 --> 00:01:56,390
I should be a little higher.

25
00:01:56,484 --> 00:01:58,063
Will two inches be enough?

26
00:01:58,492 --> 00:02:01,160
I think it'll be good.

27
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:03,740
- But it's not very comfortable.
- Is that enough?

28
00:02:04,097 --> 00:02:05,113
It's all right. It's okay. It's okay.

29
00:02:05,812 --> 00:02:06,871
That's good. That's good.

30
00:02:07,465 --> 00:02:11,556
You can step back,
it'll be safer.

31
00:02:11,892 --> 00:02:13,573
It'll be safer for you.

32
00:02:16,965 --> 00:02:20,818
Now move over like this.

33
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:23,617
I don't have to say my name?

34
00:02:23,661 --> 00:02:24,539
No.

35
00:05:01,352 --> 00:05:03,757
Vilmos is from another generation.

36
00:05:04,177 --> 00:05:07,078
He's a master of light

37
00:05:07,103 --> 00:05:08,680
that showcases the actors.

38
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:12,284
It masters the use of
from direct sources,

39
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:16,928
like the classic spotlights
in traditional cinema.

40
00:05:17,134 --> 00:05:19,732
Its light draws its strength

41
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,539
for its remarkable simplicity,

42
00:05:21,626 --> 00:05:25,261
powerful
in the composition.

43
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,055
The quality of his photography

44
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,406
is always closely related
to the story being told.

45
00:05:34,008 --> 00:05:35,674
The Italian writer,

46
00:05:35,846 --> 00:05:38,854
Umberto Eco,
has written something very beautiful.

47
00:05:39,704 --> 00:05:41,137
Art does not exist

48
00:05:41,494 --> 00:05:44,777
if the means of communication
between the artist and the public

49
00:05:45,187 --> 00:05:46,199
are not renewed.

50
00:05:46,837 --> 00:05:50,922
A step forward must be
crossed in the elements of communication

51
00:05:51,237 --> 00:05:56,651
of the thought that the artist
wants to pass on

52
00:05:57,031 --> 00:05:59,277
to the public seeing his artwork.

53
00:05:59,864 --> 00:06:01,423
A step forward must be taken.

54
00:06:01,771 --> 00:06:04,374
negotiable

55
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,272
for all mankind
not only for the artist

56
00:06:07,905 --> 00:06:09,933
Because we're not coming back
backwards,

57
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:12,055
once you've taken the plunge.

58
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:14,677
Go back in time
is imitation.

59
00:06:15,331 --> 00:06:16,502
It's not art anymore.

60
00:06:17,109 --> 00:06:19,348
And Vilmos has had a great impact

61
00:06:20,133 --> 00:06:22,309
in that way

62
00:06:22,754 --> 00:06:24,960
aesthetic or philosophical.

63
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:27,503
Because he allowed the cinema
to take a step forward,

64
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,139
from which there is no turning back
backwards.

65
00:06:36,984 --> 00:06:38,984
Vilmos, what did you dream about as a child?

66
00:06:39,523 --> 00:06:43,726
We didn't have much choice then.

67
00:06:43,828 --> 00:06:45,597
Communism

68
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,122
was in power
in my younger years.

69
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:50,896
I was 14 years old,
at the end of the war.

70
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,120
The Russians have arrived
and two years later,

71
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:56,167
the country became communist.

72
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,119
We didn't have a lot of dreams.

73
00:06:58,191 --> 00:07:00,257
Life was so limited.

74
00:07:00,511 --> 00:07:03,153
When I turned 17,
an uncle offered me

75
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,946
a book of photographs.

76
00:07:06,781 --> 00:07:11,087
The photographer
was called Eugene Dülovitz.

77
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,437
Beautiful pictures
in the backlight.

78
00:07:15,095 --> 00:07:18,510
The most important thing,
it was the light.

79
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,067
I fell in love
of photography.

80
00:07:22,095 --> 00:07:25,531
Vilmos imported with him
the photographic vision

81
00:07:26,062 --> 00:07:28,326
from Eastern Europe,
which was very refined.

82
00:07:28,723 --> 00:07:32,937
The whole story's in his house
of Hungarian photography

83
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:39,960
but also Hungarian painting,

84
00:07:40,013 --> 00:07:42,116
that was traditional

85
00:07:42,141 --> 00:07:43,148
and very classy.

86
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:47,338
How do you feel
in Hungary?

87
00:07:48,687 --> 00:07:51,818
I'm feeling very good about it,
in reality. I like to spend

88
00:07:53,967 --> 00:07:56,268
a week,
a month.

89
00:07:57,362 --> 00:07:59,722
A little longer,
if I'm making a movie.

90
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:06,844
I often think in Hungarian.
I've even started to rediscover the language.

91
00:08:07,693 --> 00:08:08,802
At one point,

92
00:08:08,935 --> 00:08:11,927
I spoke both languages
with an accent.

93
00:08:13,182 --> 00:08:14,890
I've been back there a lot.

94
00:08:15,002 --> 00:08:18,490
Then I'm probably talking about
better Hungarian.

95
00:08:18,903 --> 00:08:22,195
But I feel American, actually.
America loves immigrants.

96
00:08:23,188 --> 00:08:27,117
By the time we arrived,
it was another country.

97
00:08:31,362 --> 00:08:33,680
Yesterday, you were American
and not Hungarian.

98
00:08:33,862 --> 00:08:37,565
- What does that mean?
- Well, what was the subject?

99
00:08:37,756 --> 00:08:40,874
- It depends on the question.
- The question was simple, Vilmos.

100
00:08:41,225 --> 00:08:44,641
- Are you Hungarian or American?
- I felt American.

101
00:08:44,713 --> 00:08:46,691
And now,
you feel Hungarian?

102
00:08:47,412 --> 00:08:50,435
I feel Hungarian
in front of this beautiful panorama

103
00:08:50,578 --> 00:08:51,578
on Budapest.

104
00:08:52,746 --> 00:08:55,940
We've learned a lot
Italian movies.

105
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,075
Neo-Realist films
of Vittorio De Sica.

106
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:01,243
They showed poor people,

107
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,879
real people.
The party tolerated these films.

108
00:09:05,252 --> 00:09:06,712
So, we were imitating them

109
00:09:06,783 --> 00:09:09,315
in Hungary, even at school.

110
00:09:10,037 --> 00:09:13,530
Upstairs,
there's a projection room

111
00:09:14,284 --> 00:09:17,271
where we were watching
Western movies.

112
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,936
We have seen
The Dictator of Chaplin,

113
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,279
up there in that movie theater.

114
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,577
Actors and students
had heard about it.

115
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:28,531
They all wanted to see that movie,

116
00:09:29,246 --> 00:09:32,902
because he wasn't projected
nowhere else.

117
00:09:33,942 --> 00:09:35,553
I remember,

118
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,527
there was
seating for up to 100 people

119
00:09:40,043 --> 00:09:42,040
and about 250 spectators

120
00:09:42,102 --> 00:09:44,827
were crammed
one on top of the other

121
00:09:45,475 --> 00:09:46,668
to see this movie.

122
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,146
It was amazing.
It was a revolution.

123
00:09:52,281 --> 00:09:55,461
Chaplin makes a long speech
at the end of The Dictator.

124
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,668
It's a very capitalist discourse

125
00:10:00,223 --> 00:10:03,523
and we all thought that the police

126
00:10:03,567 --> 00:10:05,202
was coming to take us in.

127
00:10:21,897 --> 00:10:25,691
I was very familiar with this style.
It looked a lot like

128
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:28,660
to what we were doing
in Prague at that time.

129
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:32,787
Oddly enough, we were inspired

130
00:10:33,272 --> 00:10:35,066
by Hungarian films
from the fifties.

131
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:38,997
The Czech New Wave,
dates back to the '60s.

132
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,054
Hungarian films of the 1950s

133
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:47,345
were interrupted
by the Russian invasion.

134
00:10:48,108 --> 00:10:50,742
And the Czech New Wave
suffered the same fate as the Russians,

135
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:52,435
of the Soviets.

136
00:10:55,564 --> 00:10:59,624
Vilmos left Hungary in 1956.

137
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:03,420
While he was studying film.

138
00:11:03,848 --> 00:11:06,975
With László Kovács, they took a camera...

139
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:11,445
and when the Russian tanks
have entered Budapest.

140
00:11:11,662 --> 00:11:14,748
they went out into the streets
to film this footage

141
00:11:15,251 --> 00:11:17,292
of the Russian invasion.

142
00:11:17,784 --> 00:11:20,633
Students throwing
Molotov cocktails.

143
00:11:21,141 --> 00:11:23,502
They kept the film
and fled the country

144
00:11:23,796 --> 00:11:25,605
under Russian fire.

145
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,625
They went through
the Austrian border

146
00:11:28,847 --> 00:11:30,993
and the film
could have gotten to us.

147
00:11:31,086 --> 00:11:32,870
And I thought, "Well,

148
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:36,054
a man capable of doing that,

149
00:11:37,362 --> 00:11:38,664
so brave,

150
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:42,427
so inventive,
he's the man I need.

151
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:44,959
for Deliverance."

152
00:11:51,068 --> 00:11:53,776
Cinema was born for the image.

153
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,166
There was no sound or color.

154
00:11:57,359 --> 00:11:59,910
A camera
only allowed you to record

155
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:03,004
one action, one movement.

156
00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:06,756
I have a special affection
for black-and-white films.

157
00:12:07,947 --> 00:12:10,535
I consider these films

158
00:12:11,334 --> 00:12:13,468
as more graphic,

159
00:12:13,596 --> 00:12:15,691
compared to color cinema.

160
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:18,548
The colors don't come
disrupt history.

161
00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:21,842
We remove the light source
to create shadows

162
00:12:22,397 --> 00:12:26,857
and the shadows tell the story...
more than light.

163
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,382
László and I decided...

164
00:12:30,796 --> 00:12:35,025
as we were asked
to define our style,

165
00:12:36,376 --> 00:12:40,320
we decided to call it
"poetic realism".

166
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,897
Poetry,

167
00:12:42,922 --> 00:12:44,478
in a nutshell,

168
00:12:45,252 --> 00:12:48,693
is in the light
and in the compositions.

169
00:12:48,871 --> 00:12:49,879
We wanted to

170
00:12:50,038 --> 00:12:52,716
careful composition
like paintings.

171
00:12:53,494 --> 00:12:57,708
I was mostly inspired

172
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,176
of the works of Rembrandt,

173
00:13:01,295 --> 00:13:03,966
Georges de La Tour,
especially for the light,

174
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:06,006
Caravaggio.

175
00:13:06,761 --> 00:13:11,376
And mainly
of the Dutch painters.

176
00:13:11,852 --> 00:13:16,804
My photographic style
is not so different

177
00:13:16,884 --> 00:13:20,600
in the style of others
cinematographers

178
00:13:20,686 --> 00:13:23,867
whose work I love, like...

179
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:29,481
You mentioned László Kovács,

180
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:31,791
Haskell Wexler,

181
00:13:33,132 --> 00:13:34,327
Owen Roizman...

182
00:13:37,926 --> 00:13:41,085
And on the European side,
Vittorio Storaro.

183
00:13:41,371 --> 00:13:43,988
With Darius Khondji,
it's that same style.

184
00:13:44,752 --> 00:13:46,359
A lot of movies

185
00:13:46,816 --> 00:13:49,745
are more beautiful
than they should be.

186
00:13:50,745 --> 00:13:52,237
That's really something.

187
00:13:53,253 --> 00:13:56,347
I recognize
a good cinematographer,

188
00:13:57,244 --> 00:14:01,413
when the subject of the film is in agreement
with the cosmetic treatment.

189
00:14:02,492 --> 00:14:05,953
You can't just settle for
to make the pictures too beautiful.

190
00:14:06,453 --> 00:14:08,886
It can ruin a movie.

191
00:14:08,933 --> 00:14:10,475
People aren't going to feel

192
00:14:14,038 --> 00:14:18,049
what history expresses.

193
00:14:18,563 --> 00:14:19,902
It happens a lot,

194
00:14:20,021 --> 00:14:24,160
because it's easy
to make pretty pictures.

195
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,240
Yes, it's true.

196
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,040
But it can ruin a movie.

197
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,436
With digital tools,

198
00:14:29,516 --> 00:14:33,639
we can accentuate the colors,
tampering, adjusting the image.

199
00:14:34,771 --> 00:14:37,160
One can easily realize
overly stylized movies.

200
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:39,198
Today,
everyone's filming digitally.

201
00:14:39,455 --> 00:14:43,010
Many
new chief operators

202
00:14:44,145 --> 00:14:47,575
don't know how to translate atmosphere.

203
00:14:48,058 --> 00:14:49,090
They don't know.

204
00:14:49,776 --> 00:14:53,836
Producers do not
make them ask

205
00:14:54,157 --> 00:14:55,786
to go fast, faster and faster.

206
00:14:56,553 --> 00:15:00,974
It's easy to film quickly
with a digital camera.

207
00:15:01,037 --> 00:15:05,246
because all you have to do is turn on the unit...
to get a picture.

208
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:06,283
Exactly. Exactly.

209
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:08,220
Maybe even a quality image.

210
00:15:08,503 --> 00:15:10,794
You said
something interesting,

211
00:15:10,903 --> 00:15:15,448
about the time
where we were lighting the movies

212
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:18,686
shot on film.

213
00:15:19,216 --> 00:15:21,629
We were using natural light
and artificial.

214
00:15:21,907 --> 00:15:23,560
And this lighting work

215
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,572
represented the soul of the cinematographer,

216
00:15:26,688 --> 00:15:29,323
or the director
through the cinematographer.

217
00:15:29,623 --> 00:15:32,740
His will, his approach

218
00:15:32,986 --> 00:15:34,589
and his point of view.

219
00:15:35,655 --> 00:15:39,016
Light up the scenes,
the characters, the landscapes,

220
00:15:39,246 --> 00:15:43,600
this lighting work,
we're being robbed of more and more of it,

221
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,825
because he's no longer
really necessary.

222
00:15:46,334 --> 00:15:48,800
It's a big change.

223
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,544
It's interesting to point that out.

224
00:16:44,981 --> 00:16:50,054
My arrival in New York
made a big impression on me,

225
00:16:50,158 --> 00:16:53,475
because I was in shock

226
00:16:54,073 --> 00:16:57,240
in front of this great city
full of people.

227
00:16:57,289 --> 00:16:59,300
I didn't speak English.

228
00:17:01,077 --> 00:17:03,363
I've been trying to find a job.

229
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:07,885
I wanted to meet people
of the Hungarian community,

230
00:17:08,076 --> 00:17:10,716
who had emigrated
during World War II.

231
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:15,745
And it hasn't been
a great success, to tell you the truth.

232
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,554
I've met
a cinematographer

233
00:17:18,108 --> 00:17:22,261
well known in advertising,
who said to me:

234
00:17:23,132 --> 00:17:27,276
"The best advice
that I can give you,

235
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:28,967
is to forget your dream.

236
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:33,997
Become a director of photography
in America.

237
00:17:34,056 --> 00:17:37,206
Because you'll never make it.
It's too hard."

238
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,900
And the interesting thing is,

239
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,040
is that I blamed him,
at first.

240
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:47,511
But then I realized

241
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:50,962
than by telling me
that I'd never make it,

242
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:55,998
he had pushed me
to outdo myself to prove to him

243
00:17:56,432 --> 00:17:59,105
that everyone
could succeed in America.

244
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,311
I was given tasks
more and more important.

245
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,480
At first,
in low-budget movies.

246
00:18:27,527 --> 00:18:28,876
And I was wondering

247
00:18:29,254 --> 00:18:32,289
where I was going to end up
working on these films

248
00:18:32,395 --> 00:18:34,260
that no one from the movie business
would never see,

249
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,574
only the drive-in crowd.

250
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:39,905
After five years in Los Angeles,

251
00:18:40,635 --> 00:18:42,770
I was able to make
an application for naturalization.

252
00:18:42,992 --> 00:18:45,406
Immigration offices
have let me know

253
00:18:45,704 --> 00:18:51,060
that my name was too difficult
to write, to pronounce.

254
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:54,323
They advised me
to at least change your first name.

255
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:57,840
So, I was recorded
like "William" Zsigmond.

256
00:18:58,764 --> 00:19:01,895
In all my bad movies
I was credited "William."

257
00:19:02,229 --> 00:19:06,279
The people who saw them,
when I became Vilmos again,

258
00:19:06,433 --> 00:19:09,423
did not necessarily
the link with me!

259
00:19:13,504 --> 00:19:15,697
- My name is Mickey Terry.
- And I'm Szimpa Linpad.

260
00:19:16,091 --> 00:19:18,329
- Excuse me?
- Szimpa Linpad.

261
00:19:18,765 --> 00:19:20,379
- I'm Hungarian.
- You are?

262
00:19:20,472 --> 00:19:23,379
The term
"director of photography"

263
00:19:23,452 --> 00:19:27,028
was born out of the conflict that existed

264
00:19:27,754 --> 00:19:29,588
between cinematography
and directing.

265
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,853
The oldest association
is American.

266
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,989
American Society
of Cinematographers.

267
00:19:39,481 --> 00:19:42,693
When the directors formed
the Director's Guild of America,

268
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:47,001
conflict has broken out
between those who made up the image.

269
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:51,529
Cinematographers
were arrogant,

270
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,546
they said:
"we are not secondary.

271
00:19:57,349 --> 00:19:58,996
So are we,
we want to be directors."

272
00:20:01,011 --> 00:20:05,000
Although they belonged
at the Society of Cinematographers.

273
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,652
By the way, cinematographer
is the perfect term.

274
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,866
Photography, photographer.

275
00:20:12,357 --> 00:20:14,206
Cinematographer, cinematographer.

276
00:20:15,246 --> 00:20:17,989
Photography, photographer.
Cinematography, cinematographer.

277
00:20:18,948 --> 00:20:21,942
He's the one who expresses himself
through the moving light.

278
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:43,468
The CSA has always been an association

279
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:44,770
very elitist.

280
00:20:45,297 --> 00:20:50,294
It was created by cameramen
under contract with the major studios.

281
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:54,120
They used to come here to relax,
they were well paid.

282
00:20:54,178 --> 00:20:56,560
It was difficult to integrate
the association.

283
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,051
When I met you,

284
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:02,809
your wife was with you,
she spoke better English than you.

285
00:21:03,255 --> 00:21:06,802
I'm still having trouble understanding
your accent, after all these years.

286
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:08,135
But I can't hear well.

287
00:21:08,181 --> 00:21:09,993
It was at the festival
from San Francisco,

288
00:21:10,462 --> 00:21:13,421
...I used to host this crazy movie called Futz.

289
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:17,649
I knew the movie was bad,
no one had loved him.

290
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,816
At the end of the screening,
Haskell came to see me.

291
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,370
He said to me:
"I know how you feel about the movie.

292
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,879
But I gotta tell you,

293
00:21:26,939 --> 00:21:28,455
I'm very fond of photography.

294
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,747
And if you need any help
in Hollywood,

295
00:21:32,271 --> 00:21:33,310
come and see me."

296
00:21:33,879 --> 00:21:36,929
That's what he told me.
He was my first mentor,

297
00:21:37,132 --> 00:21:38,140
in America.

298
00:21:38,192 --> 00:21:41,812
This film is still available.
The photography is very successful.

299
00:21:41,986 --> 00:21:46,342
It didn't look like
to what we were doing in America.

300
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:49,066
You were a good immigrant!

301
00:21:49,487 --> 00:21:51,137
I have you to thank for that.

302
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:53,909
because it launched my career

303
00:21:54,286 --> 00:21:55,169
in Hollywood.

304
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:59,729
Our first meeting
went well.

305
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:02,936
With Lázsló already on the set,
he recommended Vilmos to me:

306
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:05,200
"His name is Bill Zsigmond,
but call him Zigi."

307
00:22:05,261 --> 00:22:07,006
"Is your name really Bill Zigi?

308
00:22:07,712 --> 00:22:10,049
Bill or Zigi,
what's your real name?"

309
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,925
"Vilmos!
- Change the claps!

310
00:22:13,195 --> 00:22:14,825
"Note this on the camera reports.

311
00:22:15,235 --> 00:22:17,874
The director of photography is called
Vilmos... Zsigmond.

312
00:22:18,178 --> 00:22:20,760
Zsigmond Vilmos?
- No, Zsigmond Vilmos."

313
00:22:22,205 --> 00:22:26,438
That's how Bill-Zigi...
got his name back.

314
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:30,920
He must have learned everything.

315
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,951
What directors
learn at school,

316
00:22:33,673 --> 00:22:35,300
he learned it on the set.

317
00:22:35,393 --> 00:22:36,720
He was an actor

318
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:40,003
and never thought
become a director.

319
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,080
He was a quick learner.

320
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,760
Within a week, he knew everything
what a director needs to know.

321
00:22:47,436 --> 00:22:49,931
I wanted to be enlightened
by candlelight

322
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,091
and oil lamps.

323
00:22:52,702 --> 00:22:54,635
It had to be realistic.

324
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:59,683
The lighting couldn't have come from
of a projector that flattens everything.

325
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:01,752
That would have ruined the story.

326
00:23:02,357 --> 00:23:04,439
To explain to Vilmos

327
00:23:06,514 --> 00:23:08,546
problems
that I was going to meet,

328
00:23:09,341 --> 00:23:12,018
I asked him to come with me
at the Fox studio.

329
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:15,728
We've been watching
a black and white copy

330
00:23:16,045 --> 00:23:18,909
from the John Ford movie,
The Infernal Pursuit.

331
00:23:19,545 --> 00:23:21,014
that my father had played in.

332
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,585
Zsigmond says to me:
"I want to see this movie."

333
00:23:25,678 --> 00:23:29,501
I tell him I'm not going
explain to him what I want.

334
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,604
"Okay, you'll tell me in the end."

335
00:23:32,629 --> 00:23:34,216
"No, you'll figure it out."

336
00:23:34,824 --> 00:23:38,361
He seemed to be wondering
why I was doing this to him.

337
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:53,638
Then we went back to the movie.

338
00:23:53,702 --> 00:23:58,137
"Peter, why do we have to see him again?
Why don't you tell me what you want?"

339
00:23:58,233 --> 00:24:01,701
I said:
"This time you're going to see him, Vilmos."

340
00:24:02,631 --> 00:24:03,445
"I don't know..."

341
00:24:03,619 --> 00:24:04,838
And the movie started.

342
00:24:04,934 --> 00:24:07,879
Fortunately, the problem appears
in the first reel.

343
00:24:08,564 --> 00:24:12,056
From the first game.
We didn't have to see the whole thing again.

344
00:24:13,501 --> 00:24:16,953
The long-awaited moment is coming
when my father walks into a hotel.

345
00:24:17,236 --> 00:24:20,588
He's wearing filthy clothes,
like a cowboy on the loose

346
00:24:20,837 --> 00:24:22,928
and there are
oil on the walls.

347
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,563
But what strikes me,

348
00:24:25,624 --> 00:24:27,973
is that they're illuminated
in the spotlight

349
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:30,657
and their light on the walls

350
00:24:31,093 --> 00:24:35,819
casts a shadow
that highlights the source of the light.

351
00:24:36,603 --> 00:24:41,328
"Ah!... You can see the shadows of the lamps,
It's not okay."

352
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,741
You got it.
"That's what you have to remember:

353
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,298
Our lamps won't make
of cast shadow."

354
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:51,061
"That's great, Peter.
Thank you for showing me this film.

355
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,760
We'll avoid that."

356
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,158
And so we did.

357
00:24:58,679 --> 00:24:59,750
There's a scene,

358
00:24:59,973 --> 00:25:03,052
in which with the camera,
we go around the house.

359
00:25:03,505 --> 00:25:06,691
You saw the movie,
you know the rest.

360
00:25:06,803 --> 00:25:09,099
The sun's going to set soon.

361
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:12,544
We know we have to succeed
this plan on the first try.

362
00:25:12,885 --> 00:25:14,221
This is the final scene.

363
00:25:15,196 --> 00:25:16,775
I wanted to finish the reel.

364
00:25:17,435 --> 00:25:20,286
I wanted to do one take
until the end.

365
00:25:21,365 --> 00:25:23,563
Zsigmond thought it was a great idea.

366
00:25:24,254 --> 00:25:26,690
We start on Verna Bloom,

367
00:25:27,976 --> 00:25:29,595
looking to his left,

368
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:33,988
and then to his right,
the camera's still moving.

369
00:25:35,816 --> 00:25:37,339
She has no text.

370
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,638
I wanted the look in his eyes.

371
00:25:40,199 --> 00:25:43,151
The camera's watching him
and sees her transform.

372
00:25:43,395 --> 00:25:45,260
Warren Oates is going back to the farm.

373
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:47,928
He's riding my horse.

374
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,932
I wanted a black and white horse

375
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:53,505
so that everyone understands
it was Harry's horse.

376
00:25:56,844 --> 00:25:59,738
Arch, played by Warren Oates,
advance on horseback.

377
00:26:00,373 --> 00:26:01,412
It's coming.

378
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,381
The frame tightens on him.

379
00:26:05,683 --> 00:26:10,286
I said to Warren:
"Keep moving while you can feel the sun.

380
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:15,854
Stay in the shadows,
leave the horse in the sun.

381
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:17,195
We'll see you, don't worry."

382
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:27,120
He had to put the horses
in the barn,

383
00:26:27,425 --> 00:26:30,542
before lighting a lantern
with the matches.

384
00:26:31,018 --> 00:26:33,922
And at some point,
after an accurate count,

385
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:37,549
he was supposed to come by
in front of the barn window.

386
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:42,501
Then he had to
backtrack

387
00:26:43,178 --> 00:26:44,678
with a lantern.

388
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,471
I wanted to make it clear

389
00:26:47,907 --> 00:26:50,783
that even if the credits started,
the film was going on.

390
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:53,033
The camera's still rolling.

391
00:26:53,803 --> 00:26:56,803
And the genius of Zsigmond has made it possible
to time the light.

392
00:26:57,478 --> 00:26:58,899
He has succeeded in this challenge

393
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:01,912
without artificial light.

394
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,232
All the lighting is natural.

395
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:05,654
He's filming Warren's arrival

396
00:27:06,176 --> 00:27:09,019
that forgets to turn on
that damn lantern.

397
00:27:09,376 --> 00:27:14,448
But Zsigmond is holding on,
he's not moving the camera.

398
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,551
We keep it running.

399
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,699
The light goes down
slowly, very slowly.

400
00:27:19,747 --> 00:27:23,021
And if you look closely,
you see the trees

401
00:27:23,765 --> 00:27:25,472
moving slightly into the wind.

402
00:27:25,615 --> 00:27:28,740
That should be enough to show
that the film was still rolling.

403
00:27:29,563 --> 00:27:33,370
We didn't freeze the image.
We kept shooting.

404
00:27:34,381 --> 00:27:37,839
And nature took care of the rest,

405
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,346
when the image went black,

406
00:27:39,964 --> 00:27:41,169
it was natural.

407
00:27:41,647 --> 00:27:43,806
We filmed
until the day's disappearance.

408
00:27:45,925 --> 00:27:47,877
And we didn't need
of a fade to black.

409
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:51,365
The sun took care of it.

410
00:27:54,376 --> 00:27:56,257
The director
and the cinematographer

411
00:27:56,329 --> 00:27:57,866
have to go hand in hand.

412
00:27:58,772 --> 00:28:02,551
Just like the director,
with his actors.

413
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:06,005
And when it does,

414
00:28:06,336 --> 00:28:10,015
it's up to the cinematographer
to immortalize this complicity.

415
00:28:21,662 --> 00:28:23,654
We were on a shoot
in San Francisco,

416
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:27,167
about to finish the movie
Taken at face value,

417
00:28:28,361 --> 00:28:29,647
of Jerry Schatzberg.

418
00:28:31,163 --> 00:28:34,450
And I wanted to show Susan

419
00:28:34,778 --> 00:28:38,087
my favorite place in California,
Big Sur.

420
00:28:39,396 --> 00:28:40,417
We came here.

421
00:28:42,099 --> 00:28:44,581
We walked around.

422
00:28:44,702 --> 00:28:48,590
We went to see
beautiful beaches.

423
00:28:52,223 --> 00:28:53,285
And we liked it.

424
00:28:55,428 --> 00:28:58,973
Later, we decided
to get married here.

425
00:28:59,878 --> 00:29:02,968
We arrived by road
that we borrowed yesterday.

426
00:29:04,095 --> 00:29:07,401
We hadn't seen the ocean yet,
or just this side.

427
00:29:07,775 --> 00:29:11,695
We discovered this house,
on this little hill.

428
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:14,706
Our car was climbing,
climbed, climbed, climbed...

429
00:29:15,516 --> 00:29:18,600
It was flat here then.
There were no trees.

430
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,258
It didn't look like that.

431
00:29:21,036 --> 00:29:22,506
And we bought the house.

432
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:24,577
That was the beginning.

433
00:29:34,518 --> 00:29:37,423
Seeing John McCabe,

434
00:29:39,176 --> 00:29:42,480
This is the first time
I was discovering the work of Vilmos...

435
00:29:43,695 --> 00:29:46,859
I thought to myself:
"It's not

436
00:29:46,894 --> 00:29:48,041
an American movie."

437
00:29:48,605 --> 00:29:53,072
I still remember the picture.
I forgot the story

438
00:29:53,575 --> 00:29:55,051
but I remember the picture.

439
00:29:55,471 --> 00:29:59,881
And that was clearly the expression

440
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:02,665
eye-to-eye
of a director of photography,

441
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,567
which was very consistent.

442
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:31,840
To understand this experience,

443
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,374
and what Vilmos has endured,
you have to know Bob.

444
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,500
Bob was very playful,
he liked to take risks.

445
00:30:39,968 --> 00:30:42,536
He was always on the edge.

446
00:30:42,805 --> 00:30:44,885
He was a good loser, too.

447
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,430
If it didn't work,
he was on his way back.

448
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,960
He was ready to start all over again,
with another movie.

449
00:30:51,985 --> 00:30:54,600
Bob wasn't going to make this movie
without Vilmos.

450
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,839
He had to fight
before we get started,

451
00:30:57,864 --> 00:30:59,376
for union matters

452
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:00,804
that he had to fix.

453
00:31:01,344 --> 00:31:03,384
It was a big production.

454
00:31:03,693 --> 00:31:07,915
Back in Hollywood,
the movies all ended "in the bath."

455
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,563
At night, the lab would parade them around,

456
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:13,030
all films
were developed together.

457
00:31:13,452 --> 00:31:14,595
Bob has had the opportunity

458
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:19,175
to develop his film separately,
in a Canadian bath at night.

459
00:31:19,512 --> 00:31:23,530
So, he and Vilmos
have decided together

460
00:31:23,689 --> 00:31:26,417
to do something called
a "flashbulb",

461
00:31:26,449 --> 00:31:27,982
which means exposing it to the light.

462
00:31:28,076 --> 00:31:30,628
After this step,
there was no turning back.

463
00:31:31,876 --> 00:31:33,352
That was final.

464
00:31:33,377 --> 00:31:36,637
It was like opening
the body of your camera,

465
00:31:38,032 --> 00:31:40,682
with film
and put it in the light a little bit.

466
00:31:40,718 --> 00:31:42,701
It changed the quality of the print.

467
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:46,503
I get it.
that a page had been turned

468
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,120
in the aesthetics of cinema.

469
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:50,161
We were shooting in Vancouver,

470
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,433
Altman had contacted

471
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:56,050
the only local lab,
at the time.

472
00:31:56,090 --> 00:32:00,580
He offered to pay
the whole development,

473
00:32:00,702 --> 00:32:02,418
from beginning to end.

474
00:32:02,505 --> 00:32:04,941
And it became a western,

475
00:32:05,005 --> 00:32:06,920
or what used to be called
a "northwestern".

476
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,991
When producers
have seen the dailies,

477
00:32:10,023 --> 00:32:11,364
they didn't panic?

478
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:14,509
- Yeah, they totally freaked out.
- I'll bet they did.

479
00:32:14,747 --> 00:32:18,413
They didn't understand.
They wondered who had filmed it.

480
00:32:18,493 --> 00:32:23,809
I wasn't famous then.
It was my first big movie,

481
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:25,199
with big stars.

482
00:32:25,421 --> 00:32:26,515
And Altman said to them:

483
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,998
"the negative of this film is perfect."

484
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:32,160
That was not true,
we did that on the negative.

485
00:32:32,255 --> 00:32:34,680
They were in shock.

486
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,840
They wanted to get rid of it.

487
00:32:37,911 --> 00:32:38,960
They wouldn't even take it out.

488
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,544
The movie wasn't "watchable."

489
00:32:40,615 --> 00:32:44,839
We were criminals,
so to speak.

490
00:32:45,209 --> 00:32:46,338
A bunch of criminals.

491
00:32:46,385 --> 00:32:48,153
Warren Beatty, you and Altman.

492
00:32:51,984 --> 00:32:54,430
It's an interesting picture,
I'd never seen her before.

493
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:04,406
It's funny, I seem to have
20 years older than my age.

494
00:33:04,779 --> 00:33:06,889
That's because the filming of the movie
was very hard.

495
00:33:11,769 --> 00:33:15,359
Choice of operator
is also important

496
00:33:15,541 --> 00:33:17,385
than the actors in a movie.

497
00:33:18,988 --> 00:33:21,359
I'd seen his work
on John McCabe.

498
00:33:21,732 --> 00:33:23,867
Which impressed me,

499
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,019
is that there was
a lot of catches

500
00:33:28,726 --> 00:33:30,480
shot with long lenses.

501
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,771
The camera was following the movement

502
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:35,441
and the focus was superb.

503
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,552
It was tremendously fluid.

504
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:40,022
And I wanted to,

505
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:43,822
I needed this guy
of shots in Deliverance.

506
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:48,120
Because it was necessary
follow the actors on canoes,

507
00:33:48,581 --> 00:33:51,076
along the river,

508
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:55,440
with long lenses,
while maintaining focus.

509
00:33:55,855 --> 00:33:57,403
When you meet
the men of the woods,

510
00:33:57,887 --> 00:33:58,995
the camera is static.

511
00:33:59,201 --> 00:34:02,752
Actors shoot the
all around

512
00:34:03,215 --> 00:34:08,142
they go in and out through
another side of the camera

513
00:34:08,221 --> 00:34:09,428
it was very disturbing.

514
00:34:10,312 --> 00:34:14,939
The camera was following the movement
in the previous scenes.

515
00:34:16,191 --> 00:34:19,479
The fixed plane
was creating enormous tension.

516
00:34:19,812 --> 00:34:22,145
Filming required
a lot of preparation.

517
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:25,050
First of all, the actors
have had to go through training

518
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,693
for canoeing, archery, archery

519
00:34:30,054 --> 00:34:31,120
and get back in shape!

520
00:34:31,205 --> 00:34:34,921
It was a very physical exercise.

521
00:34:35,753 --> 00:34:37,101
Today, all the movies

522
00:34:37,126 --> 00:34:38,690
are controlled

523
00:34:39,007 --> 00:34:41,028
to assess the dangers

524
00:34:41,257 --> 00:34:43,913
inherent in each of the scenes.

525
00:34:45,575 --> 00:34:48,199
We wouldn't have been able to shoot
Issuance

526
00:34:48,794 --> 00:34:50,196
under these conditions.

527
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:53,651
Or if we did it today,

528
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:57,047
these safety measures
would prevent us

529
00:34:57,117 --> 00:34:58,656
to make the same movie.

530
00:34:59,205 --> 00:35:01,277
I wanted to make sure
that the actors

531
00:35:01,393 --> 00:35:04,610
would do nothing
that I hadn't tried before.

532
00:35:04,915 --> 00:35:08,588
If they were worried
seeing the rapids,

533
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,987
I'd tell them, "I've already done it.

534
00:35:12,106 --> 00:35:14,479
Vilmos and I went there.

535
00:35:15,209 --> 00:35:16,879
It's doable."

536
00:35:24,806 --> 00:35:26,828
Vilmos était habile comme un chamois.

537
00:35:26,971 --> 00:35:29,626
Il pouvait adopter
toutes les positions avec sa caméra,

538
00:35:31,066 --> 00:35:32,460
avec de l'eau jusqu'au cou

539
00:35:32,865 --> 00:35:35,818
ou accroupi sous un rocher.
Il improvisait toujours.

540
00:35:35,974 --> 00:35:38,270
C'était si difficile
d'installer le matériel.

541
00:35:38,424 --> 00:35:42,130
Ce qui caractérisait Vilmos,
c'est qu'il était acharné.

542
00:35:42,447 --> 00:35:43,519
"Pourquoi on ne filme pas ?"

543
00:35:44,221 --> 00:35:46,971
Qu'est-ce qu'on attend ?
Allons-y ! Allons-y !"

544
00:35:48,052 --> 00:35:52,513
Et des fois,
ça agaçait l'équipe du tournage

545
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:55,040
parce que tout le monde
faisait au mieux.

546
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:57,480
Et je lui disais :

547
00:35:57,639 --> 00:36:01,440
"Vilmos, respire un bon coup.

548
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,639
Nous allons réussir cette prise,
ça prendra un peu de temps."

549
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:07,482
Quand je suis arrivé
sur le tournage de Délivrance,

550
00:36:08,452 --> 00:36:11,015
j'étais plutôt sûr de moi.

551
00:36:11,412 --> 00:36:14,720
J'avais fait mes preuves,

552
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:19,089
je pouvais dire au réalisateur
que je ferais les choses comme ceci

553
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,825
ou comme cela.
Et John Boorman

554
00:36:22,214 --> 00:36:24,793
écoutait toujours mes suggestions.

555
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:26,372
Mais certains jours,

556
00:36:26,419 --> 00:36:29,641
je devenais plus agressif
quand j'avais une idée.

557
00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:31,588
J'ai dépassé les limites.

558
00:36:31,613 --> 00:36:33,000
Il m'a arrêté une seconde.

559
00:36:33,778 --> 00:36:34,788
Il est venu me dire :

560
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,820
"Vilmos, si tu continues
à te comporter comme ça,

561
00:36:40,293 --> 00:36:43,594
je vais te retirer la caméra
des mains."

562
00:36:43,723 --> 00:36:45,676
- je tenais ma caméra Arriflex.

563
00:36:46,545 --> 00:36:47,728
Il l'a attrapée et m'a dit :

564
00:36:48,225 --> 00:36:49,551
"Je vais te la jeter à la figure

565
00:36:50,511 --> 00:36:53,747
et tu seras obligé d'arrêter."

566
00:36:55,588 --> 00:37:00,080
J'ai compris
que j'avais fait une erreur.

567
00:37:01,008 --> 00:37:02,277
Je lui ai présenté mes excuses.

568
00:37:03,313 --> 00:37:07,592
Et après ça,
je me suis rappelé ses paroles.

569
00:37:07,646 --> 00:37:10,883
Pas seulement sur ce tournage,
mais toute ma vie.

570
00:37:13,778 --> 00:37:17,301
J'aime travailler
avec des réalisateurs qui improvisent

571
00:37:17,389 --> 00:37:20,839
parce que des fois,
ils ne peuvent pas prévoir

572
00:37:20,985 --> 00:37:22,763
ce qu'ils voudront filmer
le lendemain.

573
00:37:23,869 --> 00:37:27,441
Et je dois les aider
à prendre ces décisions,

574
00:37:28,594 --> 00:37:30,332
en quelques minutes seulement.

575
00:37:30,635 --> 00:37:34,077
Si vous arrivez sur un lieu
et que la lumière est mauvaise,

576
00:37:34,698 --> 00:37:37,958
il faut changer d'idée
pour que ça fonctionne.

577
00:37:39,416 --> 00:37:41,480
La veille du premier jour
de tournage,

578
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:44,560
Vilmos et moi sommes retournés
sur les lieux,

579
00:37:44,702 --> 00:37:46,979
pour réfléchir à quelques angles,
quelques plans.

580
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:49,572
C'était formidable.

581
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:52,863
Le ciel était gris foncé,

582
00:37:53,163 --> 00:37:55,462
les champs étaient jaunes

583
00:37:55,858 --> 00:37:57,840
comme si nous les avions peints.

584
00:37:58,223 --> 00:38:02,240
Le vent soufflait,
les herbes de sauge virevoltaient.

585
00:38:02,416 --> 00:38:04,440
Le lendemain, c'était pareil.

586
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,400
En Amérique,

587
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,988
l'horizon s'étend à perte de vue.

588
00:38:08,346 --> 00:38:12,050
On peut voir une tempête par ici
et le soleil briller par là.

589
00:38:13,135 --> 00:38:15,422
C'est formidable de traverser
ce pays en voiture.

590
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:22,058
J'avais comme idée
de suivre ces deux personnages

591
00:38:22,129 --> 00:38:26,441
comme deux poissons hors de l'eau,
qui allaient parcourir le pays.

592
00:38:26,854 --> 00:38:29,359
Et je pensais peut-être faire
des travellings,

593
00:38:29,574 --> 00:38:31,007
pour rester en mouvement.

594
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,110
Les caméras pouvaient
suivre les déplacements.

595
00:38:33,891 --> 00:38:36,608
Et j'avais préparé
une liste d'arguments

596
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:39,340
pour expliquer
ce que je pensais chercher.

597
00:38:40,086 --> 00:38:41,610
Et Vilmos l'a écoutée.

598
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,190
Au bout d'un moment, il m'a dit :

599
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,584
"Je ne vois pas les choses
comme ça."

600
00:38:48,394 --> 00:38:52,279
J'ai répondu : "Ah bon ?"
Nous étions tous les deux très polis.

601
00:38:52,894 --> 00:38:53,680
"Explique-moi."

602
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:57,519
Il m'a répondu :
"Pour moi, ces personnages,

603
00:38:57,648 --> 00:39:00,395
même s'ils ne s'entendent pas bien,

604
00:39:01,625 --> 00:39:06,034
après une journée seulement,
ils décident de travailler ensemble.

605
00:39:06,111 --> 00:39:06,923
C'est un conte de fées."

606
00:39:07,685 --> 00:39:09,960
J'ai dit : "Oui." Et il a continué :

607
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,680
"Je crois qu'on pourrait faire
de belles images de l'Amérique

608
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:14,040
avec ces personnages."

609
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,596
Et j'ai commencé à y réfléchir.

610
00:39:16,453 --> 00:39:19,270
Bien sûr, je savais
ce que je voulais faire.

611
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,077
Je n'étais sûrement pas
très enthousiaste.

612
00:39:23,189 --> 00:39:25,546
Mais je repensais au conte de fées.

613
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:28,951
Et à 4h du matin,

614
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:31,626
j'avais réussi à me convaincre
qu'il fallait suivre cette idée.

615
00:39:32,728 --> 00:39:38,289
Le lendemain,
j'ai attendu une heure respectable

616
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,331
pour l'appeler et lui dire :
"j'aime beaucoup ton idée.

617
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,458
Plus j'y réfléchis,
plus elle me plaît.

618
00:39:45,037 --> 00:39:47,056
Je suis convaincu
qu'il faut la suivre.

619
00:39:48,171 --> 00:39:51,765
Elle me plaît tellement
que je dirai qu'elle vient de moi."

620
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:10,920
Vilmos n'est pas que chef opérateur,
c'est aussi un penseur.

621
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:14,600
Comme il m'avait tout de suite
suggéré une idée,

622
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:18,947
je savais qu'il avait lu le scénario,
que l'histoire l'intéressait.

623
00:40:19,057 --> 00:40:21,677
Il s'intéressait au scénario,
aux comédiens

624
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:26,166
et il s'inquiétait toujours
de la réaction du public.

625
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,996
Tout le monde n'est pas
aussi consciencieux.

626
00:40:32,336 --> 00:40:35,947
On a moins besoin de coupes
au montage,

627
00:40:36,531 --> 00:40:39,327
avec un film tourné en Scope.

628
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:44,952
Un plan en Scope permet de suivre
deux valeurs de plans

629
00:40:45,674 --> 00:40:46,825
pendant très longtemps.

630
00:40:47,452 --> 00:40:49,211
Les acteurs sont en gros plan

631
00:40:50,116 --> 00:40:52,775
tout en montrant
le paysage derrière eux.

632
00:40:53,301 --> 00:40:54,890
Un montage trop saccadé

633
00:40:55,388 --> 00:40:59,759
détourne l'attention des spectateurs
du fil de l'histoire,

634
00:41:00,211 --> 00:41:01,641
avec trop de coupes.

635
00:41:02,378 --> 00:41:05,441
De nos jours,
c'est un style très répandu.

636
00:41:05,497 --> 00:41:08,521
Beaucoup de gens aiment
les montages frénétiques.

637
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,025
Découper chaque seconde.

638
00:41:10,572 --> 00:41:12,635
Et on ne peut pas
s'empêcher de réfléchir.

639
00:41:12,699 --> 00:41:14,603
D'accord, on voit un film

640
00:41:15,064 --> 00:41:19,460
mais sans être immergé
dans l'histoire.

641
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:23,249
Quand une scène
dure plus d'une minute,

642
00:41:24,439 --> 00:41:27,082
on peut presque oublier
qu'on est dans une salle de cinéma.

643
00:41:27,574 --> 00:41:29,579
On observe la vie

644
00:41:30,716 --> 00:41:34,000
se dérouler en une seule séquence.

645
00:41:35,214 --> 00:41:38,767
Beaucoup de réalisateurs
apprécient ce style.

646
00:41:38,908 --> 00:41:41,116
It allows
to tell a story better.

647
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:54,830
Sugarland Express has been my
first movie with Steven.

648
00:41:57,813 --> 00:41:59,615
Steven was so young!

649
00:42:02,262 --> 00:42:03,981
We had a great time
on this set.

650
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,329
We were able to make
almost everything we wanted,

651
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,935
against the will of the studio.

652
00:42:11,888 --> 00:42:14,795
They thought some of the plans
were infeasible.

653
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,533
We started
talking about movies

654
00:42:19,939 --> 00:42:21,018
and style.

655
00:42:21,417 --> 00:42:26,044
Steven had some good ideas
and he was also very open.

656
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:28,440
I've been looking for solutions.

657
00:42:28,501 --> 00:42:31,969
I suggested a small model
of the Panavision camera.

658
00:42:32,024 --> 00:42:33,326
We could place her

659
00:42:33,376 --> 00:42:36,622
in the middle of the car
to film through the windows.

660
00:42:37,162 --> 00:42:40,154
The old models were unsuitable,
especially for sound.

661
00:42:40,439 --> 00:42:42,662
He didn't want to film in the studio.

662
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,950
He wanted
that the film is realistic.

663
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:47,431
He had thought of many angles.

664
00:42:47,872 --> 00:42:49,407
He added a touch of comedy.

665
00:42:49,495 --> 00:42:52,511
The public made Spielberg

666
00:42:52,884 --> 00:42:54,922
a very sought-after director,
after this movie.

667
00:42:55,097 --> 00:42:58,033
He went on and on
with the famous Jaws.

668
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,558
I wasn't involved.

669
00:42:59,613 --> 00:43:01,759
I was busy on other shoots.

670
00:43:04,524 --> 00:43:05,607
From you to me,

671
00:43:06,553 --> 00:43:08,426
I didn't like the story.

672
00:43:08,514 --> 00:43:11,915
It's funny to think
that I turned down this movie.

673
00:43:12,654 --> 00:43:17,871
I didn't think it was
as good as Sugarland Express.

674
00:43:18,123 --> 00:43:21,419
And not so good too.
than Dating the Third Kind.

675
00:43:21,798 --> 00:43:24,440
He promised me
that we'd shoot it together,

676
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:27,468
when he's done
Jaws.

677
00:43:35,008 --> 00:43:37,603
It was a small project,
on a very small budget.

678
00:43:38,666 --> 00:43:39,928
It was a student film.

679
00:43:40,273 --> 00:43:43,172
And he managed to implicate
other writers.

680
00:43:43,444 --> 00:43:46,176
They developed the idea

681
00:43:46,425 --> 00:43:47,477
to make

682
00:43:48,254 --> 00:43:49,723
a 35 mm film.

683
00:43:49,802 --> 00:43:53,120
The budget
several thousand dollars

684
00:43:54,028 --> 00:43:57,664
started to swell, little by little.

685
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:00,427
About $8 million.
Richard Dreyfuss

686
00:44:00,491 --> 00:44:01,510
joined the film crew

687
00:44:01,708 --> 00:44:05,399
and the budget went up.
In the beginning, the film was supposed to cost...

688
00:44:05,502 --> 00:44:07,962
about 15 or 16 million
of dollars.

689
00:44:08,542 --> 00:44:10,296
At the time,

690
00:44:11,366 --> 00:44:14,826
we talked a lot
of UFO sightings in America.

691
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:19,139
That's why
that people were interested in the film.

692
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,120
"Yeah, let's make a movie.

693
00:44:21,279 --> 00:44:25,279
Let's do something good."

694
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:28,639
The film became
bigger and bigger.

695
00:44:28,792 --> 00:44:31,847
Steven had some new ideas
every day, every night.

696
00:44:31,942 --> 00:44:32,857
He was watching old movies.

697
00:44:32,882 --> 00:44:35,544
"Well, I'd have to stop..."

698
00:44:36,058 --> 00:44:38,518
The budget had increased a lot.

699
00:44:38,754 --> 00:44:42,349
In the end, it cost
$20 million.

700
00:44:42,891 --> 00:44:44,482
Maybe even 25 million.

701
00:44:45,053 --> 00:44:46,894
And Columbia Pictures

702
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:50,706
was on the verge of bankruptcy,
at that time.

703
00:44:50,968 --> 00:44:52,466
They didn't make good movies.

704
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,778
It had been a bad year.

705
00:44:55,449 --> 00:44:58,661
They were afraid of losing everything

706
00:44:59,104 --> 00:45:01,335
and close the door.

707
00:45:02,113 --> 00:45:04,243
And I kept telling them:

708
00:45:05,047 --> 00:45:08,413
"Don't worry,
...this movie is gonna save Columbia."

709
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,327
The last sequence of the film

710
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,660
was like a dream.

711
00:45:17,811 --> 00:45:20,080
We have realized
that we're running out of light.

712
00:45:20,672 --> 00:45:24,686
The last 40 minutes were
a light show.

713
00:45:25,218 --> 00:45:26,828
It was all about the light.

714
00:45:27,884 --> 00:45:30,694
The ship's door opens
and an incredible light

715
00:45:31,225 --> 00:45:32,905
spreads out over the set.

716
00:45:33,223 --> 00:45:35,611
We must have overexposed
the characters

717
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:38,114
to accentuate the bright light.

718
00:45:38,543 --> 00:45:41,171
With two or three degrees
of overexposure.

719
00:45:41,841 --> 00:45:45,809
But the public understood
that it wasn't a mistake.

720
00:45:46,271 --> 00:45:47,431
It was on purpose.

721
00:45:49,826 --> 00:45:51,452
When I got my Oscar,

722
00:45:51,564 --> 00:45:56,223
I should have thought
to thank Steven Spielberg.

723
00:45:57,032 --> 00:45:58,088
I forgot.

724
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:01,277
It's the worst thing I've ever done.
I owe him an apology.

725
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:05,306
because he's the one who deserved
the award I received.

726
00:46:05,788 --> 00:46:07,288
It was his movie.

727
00:46:07,462 --> 00:46:09,280
I made that mistake,

728
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:12,396
because the conditions of filming
were terrible.

729
00:46:12,737 --> 00:46:14,387
Everybody wanted to fire me.

730
00:46:14,412 --> 00:46:17,872
It haunted me for years.
It was a mistake.

731
00:46:18,021 --> 00:46:24,158
But in my defense,
Close Encounters... has been nominated eleven times...

732
00:46:24,325 --> 00:46:25,722
and I was the only one who won.

733
00:46:25,858 --> 00:46:28,923
It was the first prize awarded
that night.

734
00:46:30,279 --> 00:46:32,331
If I had known
that it was going to be the last one,

735
00:46:33,174 --> 00:46:35,570
if I had been told
that it would be the only one,

736
00:46:36,078 --> 00:46:37,184
I would have said:

737
00:46:37,366 --> 00:46:42,336
"Sorry, this award
goes to Steven Spielberg."

738
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:31,475
Today, when I speak

739
00:47:31,673 --> 00:47:32,776
to someone,

740
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,563
the question always comes up.

741
00:47:37,722 --> 00:47:42,126
To know what the movie is
that I'd rather do?

742
00:47:44,432 --> 00:47:47,844
Then I'll ask the question again.

743
00:47:48,005 --> 00:47:49,657
"What's the movie
that you liked better,

744
00:47:50,864 --> 00:47:52,468
of my entire career?"

745
00:47:53,586 --> 00:47:55,930
95 percent of the time,

746
00:47:56,471 --> 00:47:58,205
I get the answer:
Journey to the end of hell.

747
00:48:03,594 --> 00:48:04,829
For my sake,

748
00:48:05,131 --> 00:48:08,826
it's 100 percent cinema.

749
00:48:08,917 --> 00:48:10,804
I don't find any fault with it.

750
00:48:11,413 --> 00:48:15,090
Even the less successful parts.
Some scenes are underexposed

751
00:48:15,558 --> 00:48:18,050
not by accident,
but out of necessity.

752
00:48:18,669 --> 00:48:20,876
We didn't have a lot of equipment

753
00:48:21,561 --> 00:48:23,767
in Thailand,
to film the night scene.

754
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,990
The generator blew up,
we had to dim the lights.

755
00:48:28,086 --> 00:48:30,359
But the image was consistent.

756
00:48:30,519 --> 00:48:32,952
The film was more realistic,
more touching,

757
00:48:33,547 --> 00:48:35,134
thanks to this lack of lighting.

758
00:48:35,762 --> 00:48:37,460
It couldn't have been better.

759
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:41,527
We were limited
under these conditions.

760
00:48:42,331 --> 00:48:44,079
And we did our best.

761
00:48:45,532 --> 00:48:48,705
But that's where the sound
plays an important role.

762
00:48:49,215 --> 00:48:53,351
In a dark movie,
with an underexposed image.

763
00:48:53,938 --> 00:48:55,768
Sometimes,
sound can save a movie.

764
00:48:56,636 --> 00:49:00,790
People listen more carefully
and don't see everything.

765
00:49:51,056 --> 00:49:54,519
I was discovering Pittsburgh
in an American movie.

766
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,339
But that wasn't the idea
that I had America.

767
00:49:57,639 --> 00:49:59,134
I used to live in London.

768
00:49:59,213 --> 00:50:01,610
The beginning of the film
has marked me more than anything else.

769
00:50:02,004 --> 00:50:07,068
There was something
of profoundly honest

770
00:50:07,525 --> 00:50:09,519
in this story of workers

771
00:50:09,622 --> 00:50:12,916
who were sent to war
like cannon fodder.

772
00:50:13,422 --> 00:50:14,946
It was very unusual.

773
00:50:15,065 --> 00:50:17,201
If they wouldn't die at the factory...

774
00:50:17,425 --> 00:50:19,240
Yeah, they had nothing to lose.

775
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,200
I remember the fire scenes
in the steel mills,

776
00:50:22,405 --> 00:50:24,920
Early in the morning, when they go out
from work.

777
00:50:24,987 --> 00:50:27,587
It didn't look like a war movie...
with John Wayne.

778
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:31,452
The aesthetics of the film
contributes a lot to that.

779
00:50:32,032 --> 00:50:34,017
That's interesting,

780
00:50:34,672 --> 00:50:37,370
we've been fortunate
to live in these times.

781
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:40,775
Everything that has been produced
in the '60s and '70s,

782
00:50:41,352 --> 00:50:45,398
it's been a miracle
in the history of American cinema,

783
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:47,418
because everything's changed.

784
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:51,539
Everybody
wanted to reinvent cinema.

785
00:50:51,888 --> 00:50:55,087
And it's true,
this influence came from Europe,

786
00:50:55,648 --> 00:50:57,170
for most of us.

787
00:50:57,273 --> 00:50:59,519
Even those who didn't come
of European countries,

788
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:01,384
so do the Americans.

789
00:51:02,289 --> 00:51:06,065
Haskell, you made this movie...
what was it called?

790
00:51:06,124 --> 00:51:07,886
America, America.

791
00:51:08,108 --> 00:51:11,528
That's pretty representative.
It was a film shot abroad...

792
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,440
but made in America.

793
00:51:14,067 --> 00:51:15,781
When you look at the pictures

794
00:51:16,122 --> 00:51:21,295
great photographers
like Diane Arbus,

795
00:51:21,366 --> 00:51:23,199
Cartier-Bresson,
or others like them,

796
00:51:24,292 --> 00:51:28,054
they are impregnated
of their personalities

797
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:31,439
which allows the photographed subject
to feel free

798
00:51:31,526 --> 00:51:33,359
and be himself.

799
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:35,336
To a certain extent,
the chief operator

800
00:51:35,417 --> 00:51:37,476
brings the same thing.

801
00:51:37,973 --> 00:51:40,791
One way or another,
when you get older,

802
00:51:40,947 --> 00:51:42,677
you wish you could say:

803
00:51:43,137 --> 00:51:46,659
"My existence on Earth
has served a purpose

804
00:51:47,072 --> 00:51:49,889
and will not disappear
after my last breath."

805
00:51:52,812 --> 00:51:55,201
We had built a tent

806
00:51:55,241 --> 00:51:57,447
for the roller-skating scene.

807
00:51:58,952 --> 00:52:02,278
The ceiling was made of canvas

808
00:52:02,825 --> 00:52:04,932
painted in sepia tones.

809
00:52:06,012 --> 00:52:08,563
We didn't need
of filtering on the cameras,

810
00:52:08,621 --> 00:52:11,307
we could film faster.

811
00:52:11,444 --> 00:52:13,102
The only problem,

812
00:52:14,007 --> 00:52:17,467
is when the clouds
were moving outside.

813
00:52:18,572 --> 00:52:20,080
Everything was getting dark

814
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,774
and then became clearer again.

815
00:52:22,012 --> 00:52:25,104
We had posted
someone out there,

816
00:52:25,647 --> 00:52:28,914
a camera assistant

817
00:52:29,445 --> 00:52:30,946
with a walkie-talkie

818
00:52:31,375 --> 00:52:33,864
that said:
"In five seconds,

819
00:52:34,372 --> 00:52:36,331
a cloud will cover the sun."

820
00:52:37,219 --> 00:52:39,275
At that moment,
my camera assistant

821
00:52:39,997 --> 00:52:41,927
had his hand on the shutter

822
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,768
and waited for the light to change
on the ceiling,

823
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:49,622
to change the settings
one or two stops.

824
00:52:52,417 --> 00:52:54,439
Christopher Walken.

825
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:57,708
Isabelle Huppert!

826
00:53:00,242 --> 00:53:02,242
Michael Cimino made this movie

827
00:53:03,147 --> 00:53:04,375
years ago

828
00:53:04,526 --> 00:53:07,375
and no one understood
what he was talking about.

829
00:53:08,717 --> 00:53:13,213
America was booming
economical at the time.

830
00:53:13,324 --> 00:53:15,126
People understand this movie

831
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:16,795
much better today.

832
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,252
Michael Cimino had ordered

833
00:53:52,331 --> 00:53:55,172
a delicious lunch.
As I recall,

834
00:53:55,765 --> 00:53:59,300
it's still ingrained
as the happiest day

835
00:54:00,711 --> 00:54:02,419
of the whole shoot.

836
00:54:03,298 --> 00:54:06,072
To have this lunch with Cimino

837
00:54:06,111 --> 00:54:08,466
and also Isabelle.

838
00:55:06,389 --> 00:55:08,604
What's the hardest part,

839
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:10,816
once you live
with a cinematographer?

840
00:55:11,018 --> 00:55:11,462
Well, well, well, well,

841
00:55:12,994 --> 00:55:15,549
the hardest part,
it's probably

842
00:55:15,923 --> 00:55:18,708
that the film
always comes first.

843
00:55:19,919 --> 00:55:22,473
It doesn't matter.
if it's an important birthday,

844
00:55:23,037 --> 00:55:27,436
the death of a relative,
a funeral.

845
00:55:28,426 --> 00:55:29,819
The film always comes first.

846
00:55:30,157 --> 00:55:31,538
And the easiest part?

847
00:55:32,286 --> 00:55:36,586
We've traveled everywhere
in the world,

848
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:38,267
in fascinating places.

849
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:41,356
The film I found
the most extraordinary,

850
00:55:41,814 --> 00:55:45,518
It was a TV movie.
whose name was Stalin.

851
00:55:47,295 --> 00:55:48,938
A whole team has been on the move
in Moscow,

852
00:55:49,597 --> 00:55:53,464
in 1991, right after the coup.

853
00:55:54,078 --> 00:55:58,647
We were able to see Russia

854
00:55:58,726 --> 00:56:00,781
in the middle of a turmoil.

855
00:56:01,216 --> 00:56:03,684
Vilmos and Ivan Passer,
the director, for the shooting,

856
00:56:04,828 --> 00:56:08,204
had access to the Kremlin,

857
00:56:08,317 --> 00:56:11,097
to parts that had
never been open to the public,

858
00:56:11,843 --> 00:56:14,487
but also to Stalin's dacha.

859
00:56:15,182 --> 00:56:19,103
His old cleaning lady
was still there.

860
00:56:19,485 --> 00:56:23,590
The American team
came in under the snow,

861
00:56:23,696 --> 00:56:24,836
in this dacha.

862
00:56:24,903 --> 00:56:28,320
We all went to see
where Stalin had lived.

863
00:56:28,387 --> 00:56:31,582
A prima ballerina
from the Bolshoi Ballet

864
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:35,029
came into these rooms,
to dance Swan Lake.

865
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:44,347
When I was getting ready
filming Stalin in Russia,

866
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,541
I knew I needed
from Vilmos.

867
00:56:49,596 --> 00:56:50,542
He said to me, "You know,

868
00:56:51,169 --> 00:56:53,073
I only make movies."

869
00:56:53,137 --> 00:56:55,899
And it was a TV movie for HBO.

870
00:56:57,943 --> 00:56:59,861
I said, "Vilmos, listen.

871
00:57:01,758 --> 00:57:05,061
Since you've managed
to ruin United Artists

872
00:57:05,656 --> 00:57:09,640
with The Gateway to Paradise
from Cimino

873
00:57:10,708 --> 00:57:14,823
everyone is afraid of
hire you because of it.

874
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:17,674
If you team up with me,

875
00:57:19,279 --> 00:57:22,733
you'll always find a job
after Stalin."

876
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:26,470
I was just joking when I said that.

877
00:57:26,583 --> 00:57:29,100
We liked to tease each other.

878
00:57:29,286 --> 00:57:33,141
Imagine if we succeeded
making 34 shots,

879
00:57:33,693 --> 00:57:34,548
on the last day.

880
00:57:35,656 --> 00:57:37,714
34 camera positions.

881
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:41,616
For Heaven's Gate,
he only did one a day.

882
00:57:42,609 --> 00:57:43,669
He had made

883
00:57:44,388 --> 00:57:46,320
a lighting system.

884
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,249
He had covered with a sheet

885
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,401
a frame on wheels,

886
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,200
that we're moving everywhere.

887
00:57:54,359 --> 00:57:56,158
It took us three minutes

888
00:57:57,158 --> 00:57:58,734
to light up a socket.

889
00:57:59,777 --> 00:58:04,730
That's why our film
was the only one to meet the deadline

890
00:58:05,096 --> 00:58:06,036
in Russia.

891
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:09,359
In every movie I direct,

892
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:11,034
for my own pleasure,

893
00:58:11,447 --> 00:58:15,650
I like to pay tribute
to another director.

894
00:58:16,604 --> 00:58:18,490
For Stalin, in the Kremlin,

895
00:58:20,241 --> 00:58:23,350
I wanted to pay tribute
to Sergei Eisenstein.

896
00:58:24,818 --> 00:58:29,337
There are these big shadows

897
00:58:30,401 --> 00:58:32,009
in his movie Ivan the Terrible,

898
00:58:33,748 --> 00:58:35,541
...that are outlined on the walls.

899
00:58:35,613 --> 00:58:36,524
I told Vilmos:

900
00:58:37,071 --> 00:58:38,463
"We'll make a take

901
00:58:39,147 --> 00:58:41,979
when Robert Duvall-Stalin,
go up the stairs.

902
00:58:42,471 --> 00:58:47,055
We'll see his shadow
grow up, grow up, grow up."

903
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,659
Vilmos answered me:
"We lack lighting.

904
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,216
We don't have the time."

905
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:55,855
I said to him:
"You'll figure it out."

906
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,040
And of course he found her.

907
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:01,663
Even if you forgot this movie,
you remember that scene.

908
00:59:23,232 --> 00:59:24,771
Did I look like this?

909
00:59:25,533 --> 00:59:28,873
A mustache
and tousled hair?

910
00:59:29,182 --> 00:59:32,279
And me, explaining to Vilmos
what take I wanted.

911
00:59:32,519 --> 00:59:34,835
It's one of the first plans
that we shot.

912
00:59:35,041 --> 00:59:37,732
Vilmos helped a lot
for this take.

913
00:59:37,883 --> 00:59:41,263
When the nose of the plane
falls within the scope,

914
00:59:41,557 --> 00:59:42,572
it was perfect.

915
00:59:42,890 --> 00:59:44,728
With "The Rose" written on the plane.

916
00:59:44,759 --> 00:59:48,402
I owe this plan to Vilmos.

917
00:59:48,577 --> 00:59:50,424
I met him

918
00:59:50,734 --> 00:59:51,757
thanks to Robert Altman.

919
00:59:52,424 --> 00:59:55,000
One night, we were having dinner.
We were friends.

920
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:57,654
He said, "You should
...to play the role of Marty Augustine."

921
00:59:57,924 --> 01:00:00,774
Bob had rented a house
in Malibu

922
01:00:01,417 --> 01:00:02,947
to shoot The Private

923
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:06,680
and he lived in this house
during the filming.

924
01:00:07,171 --> 01:00:09,104
Bob didn't do anything like everybody else.

925
01:00:09,676 --> 01:00:15,122
Vilmos loved making this movie
on location outside the studios.

926
01:00:15,502 --> 01:00:17,423
Even though he was very talented

927
01:00:17,465 --> 01:00:18,230
in the studio.

928
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:20,826
I was amazed

929
01:00:21,389 --> 01:00:25,518
by the fact that he was

930
01:00:25,716 --> 01:00:29,855
plus a collaborator,
than a simple chief operator.

931
01:00:31,782 --> 01:00:34,229
That movie, The Rose
shot with Vilmos,

932
01:00:36,011 --> 01:00:39,185
it's the most important work
of my career.

933
01:00:43,792 --> 01:00:45,985
Vilmos is a very sensitive man.

934
01:00:46,435 --> 01:00:49,155
He's emotionally fragile

935
01:00:49,872 --> 01:00:52,131
and very receptive
to the intimist atmosphere.

936
01:00:52,924 --> 01:00:57,122
Bette had to do all the
live concert stages.

937
01:00:58,192 --> 01:01:00,752
and we only had one shot,
every time.

938
01:01:02,054 --> 01:01:05,700
So, I decided to call
all my friends chief operators

939
01:01:05,748 --> 01:01:07,200
so they'll help me,

940
01:01:08,055 --> 01:01:09,542
each one behind a camera.

941
01:01:10,493 --> 01:01:14,928
"Choose an angle
and do whatever you want.

942
01:01:15,635 --> 01:01:17,817
Improvise, follow your desires."

943
01:01:18,441 --> 01:01:20,470
All I said to them was:

944
01:01:20,879 --> 01:01:23,356
"You'll do close-ups.

945
01:01:23,864 --> 01:01:25,777
You, you'll take care
wide shots.

946
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:29,665
You can change the focal length,
change the angle,

947
01:01:30,252 --> 01:01:31,228
during the concert."

948
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:34,149
And that's why
that in the credits there's

949
01:01:34,214 --> 01:01:37,799
the best chief operators
from Hollywood.

950
01:01:37,867 --> 01:01:40,769
Lázsló Kovács, Haskell Wexler,

951
01:01:41,318 --> 01:01:42,563
Owen Roizman,

952
01:01:43,634 --> 01:01:44,713
Johnny Alonzo.

953
01:01:47,439 --> 01:01:50,685
It was great.
The pictures are beautiful.

954
01:01:51,309 --> 01:01:53,504
They had too many choices when they were editing.

955
01:01:53,955 --> 01:01:55,329
Really,
it wasn't difficult.

956
01:01:56,821 --> 01:01:59,243
With an artist like Bette,

957
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:01,883
and with the songs

958
01:02:01,923 --> 01:02:02,875
she was singing,

959
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,081
and with the musicians
that were with him.

960
01:02:07,239 --> 01:02:09,160
We didn't have

961
01:02:10,611 --> 01:02:12,881
the feeling of doing
an ordinary musical.

962
01:02:13,791 --> 01:02:19,920
It was more like
a raw show of improvisation.

963
01:02:21,963 --> 01:02:23,400
It wasn't difficult.

964
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:27,618
All we had to do,
was to encourage

965
01:02:27,904 --> 01:02:32,898
the team to improvise.

966
01:02:33,445 --> 01:02:34,440
Live in the moment.

967
01:02:34,475 --> 01:02:36,800
"If you see something good,
move over."

968
01:02:37,111 --> 01:02:38,483
There were a lot of cameramen.

969
01:02:39,134 --> 01:02:43,678
"Do not follow
what you were planning to do.

970
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:45,400
Be creative

971
01:02:45,436 --> 01:02:47,839
and move around
whenever you feel like it.

972
01:02:47,864 --> 01:02:50,690
Don't hesitate, Lázsló.
Go for it,

973
01:02:50,996 --> 01:02:53,802
and goes as close as possible to his performance."

974
01:03:47,617 --> 01:03:52,400
Blow out is my favorite movie,
as an actress.

975
01:03:52,529 --> 01:03:55,484
For several reasons.

976
01:03:55,564 --> 01:03:57,352
I loved the script.

977
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:01,311
Like I said,
I didn't think I'd do it.

978
01:04:03,363 --> 01:04:04,910
I didn't like the character.

979
01:04:05,699 --> 01:04:10,185
So I had to find a way
to fall in love with her.

980
01:04:10,281 --> 01:04:11,281
I believe...

981
01:04:11,423 --> 01:04:14,161
that working with John has helped me,

982
01:04:14,612 --> 01:04:18,272
we were able to find
what was going to work

983
01:04:18,343 --> 01:04:19,050
for us.

984
01:04:19,518 --> 01:04:20,589
Next,

985
01:04:21,852 --> 01:04:25,484
the experience of shooting was
the best I've ever had in my entire career.

986
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:31,291
It was all there,
the sound, the makeup,

987
01:04:31,553 --> 01:04:33,303
the hairstyles, the costumes,

988
01:04:33,858 --> 01:04:35,232
the beautiful images.

989
01:04:35,265 --> 01:04:37,518
Most important
in a movie,

990
01:04:37,550 --> 01:04:39,780
is when this whole
machine is well oiled.

991
01:04:39,923 --> 01:04:41,748
I didn't know you hated
your character.

992
01:04:42,363 --> 01:04:44,781
We loved him, anyway.

993
01:04:44,892 --> 01:04:47,955
And that's why
that the end was tragic.

994
01:04:48,552 --> 01:04:49,687
We didn't want to lose her.

995
01:04:50,026 --> 01:04:52,496
And in another end, she survived.

996
01:04:52,582 --> 01:04:55,344
The scream was recorded,

997
01:04:55,941 --> 01:04:57,504
but they said
that you'd been hurt.

998
01:04:58,582 --> 01:04:59,806
Unlike the other one.

999
01:05:00,148 --> 01:05:03,569
We chose the version
Shakespearean.

1000
01:05:03,807 --> 01:05:05,751
- That was Brian.
- Yeah, it was Brian.

1001
01:05:06,128 --> 01:05:08,307
That was an interesting choice.

1002
01:05:08,332 --> 01:05:10,595
The first
would have been more commercial.

1003
01:05:11,348 --> 01:05:12,785
The other one wasn't.

1004
01:05:12,825 --> 01:05:17,565
I remember arriving
on this beautiful location.

1005
01:05:18,145 --> 01:05:21,454
It was like a painting,
there was a bridge and a river.

1006
01:05:21,486 --> 01:05:25,561
"What are they filming down there?
Owls and frogs?"

1007
01:05:25,879 --> 01:05:28,834
This sequence
made us laugh a lot.

1008
01:05:29,192 --> 01:05:33,541
Brian asked me for a plan
over the frog's shoulder.

1009
01:05:35,342 --> 01:05:36,839
But the frog

1010
01:05:37,008 --> 01:05:38,449
was tiny!

1011
01:05:39,322 --> 01:05:41,627
We've settled in.

1012
01:05:41,944 --> 01:05:43,365
The frog was there.

1013
01:05:45,205 --> 01:05:48,493
We placed the camera,
we put in a dioptric corrector.

1014
01:05:49,002 --> 01:05:50,827
It was hard to take stock

1015
01:05:51,175 --> 01:05:52,755
and even madness.

1016
01:05:53,346 --> 01:05:55,616
There was the dioptric corrector...
and the frog...

1017
01:05:57,887 --> 01:05:59,339
and the bridge in the background.

1018
01:06:03,021 --> 01:06:05,370
If you want
make a realistic movie,

1019
01:06:05,516 --> 01:06:07,711
you have to use this technique.

1020
01:06:07,758 --> 01:06:09,336
If there's not much light,

1021
01:06:09,779 --> 01:06:14,320
the dioptric corrector
allows you to extend the focus.

1022
01:06:14,551 --> 01:06:17,991
Brian was known
for his 360-degree shots.

1023
01:06:18,294 --> 01:06:19,431
I don't like to admit it,

1024
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:21,897
but only time
where I left a set,

1025
01:06:22,519 --> 01:06:23,529
it was there.

1026
01:06:23,554 --> 01:06:25,007
- Really?
- Yes

1027
01:06:25,366 --> 01:06:25,985
Why?

1028
01:06:26,018 --> 01:06:27,405
I don't know if you knew that.

1029
01:06:27,666 --> 01:06:29,887
- In the editing room?
- Yes, in the editing room.

1030
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:32,458
That was take 57,
I remember very well.

1031
01:06:32,483 --> 01:06:33,490
57.

1032
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:37,567
And I told Brian...
He was exhausted and so was I.

1033
01:06:37,678 --> 01:06:39,266
We were all exhausted.

1034
01:06:40,194 --> 01:06:44,130
We were already at the end of the
third month of shooting.

1035
01:06:44,874 --> 01:06:45,946
I said to Brian:

1036
01:06:46,279 --> 01:06:50,286
"Tell me what more you want

1037
01:06:50,897 --> 01:06:54,307
that we haven't already filmed
on the 10th take and I'll do it.

1038
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:57,902
But I don't have the energy
to start over."

1039
01:06:58,418 --> 01:07:00,755
He said, "Do it again."

1040
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:04,096
I said to him:
"I can't. I can't anymore."

1041
01:07:04,659 --> 01:07:05,800
And I left.

1042
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:08,582
I knew that out of those 57 takes,

1043
01:07:08,732 --> 01:07:12,152
there was one
that was gonna work.

1044
01:07:12,896 --> 01:07:14,070
I remember a scene

1045
01:07:14,222 --> 01:07:16,865
in the train station, in the restaurant.

1046
01:07:17,537 --> 01:07:20,307
Brian wanted to move on
and I said, "No, no, no.

1047
01:07:20,616 --> 01:07:21,975
We have to do another one."

1048
01:07:22,015 --> 01:07:25,969
This time, I'm the one
asked to do another take.

1049
01:07:26,499 --> 01:07:28,607
One or two takes later,

1050
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:29,995
you did it.

1051
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:32,419
I had seen in rehearsals

1052
01:07:33,337 --> 01:07:35,210
that you could play this scene

1053
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:37,670
to perfection.
All the shots were good,

1054
01:07:37,702 --> 01:07:40,454
but less than in rehearsals.
And I was thinking:

1055
01:07:40,505 --> 01:07:42,890
"Nancy's got to make it."

1056
01:07:42,982 --> 01:07:45,348
It's a tricky thing to pull off,

1057
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:48,279
it can be very repetitive.

1058
01:07:48,313 --> 01:07:51,728
We'll have to wait,
before you get back to the magic.

1059
01:07:52,413 --> 01:07:55,978
And I've always loved
working with John,

1060
01:07:56,130 --> 01:07:59,384
cause
if we had to make a scene again,

1061
01:07:59,415 --> 01:08:01,918
he added something
different.

1062
01:08:02,196 --> 01:08:03,792
You had to bounce back.

1063
01:08:04,008 --> 01:08:06,000
In this scene,

1064
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:08,449
he did it to me twice.

1065
01:08:08,909 --> 01:08:10,877
And it was really...

1066
01:08:11,111 --> 01:08:13,413
- It looks more alive.
- It's fresh.

1067
01:08:13,801 --> 01:08:15,515
You have to trust the director.

1068
01:08:15,634 --> 01:08:17,432
We loved Brian, the look in his eyes.

1069
01:08:18,075 --> 01:08:21,202
But we must also be able to trust
to the director of photography,

1070
01:08:22,149 --> 01:08:24,324
or else an actor dies inside.

1071
01:08:24,688 --> 01:08:27,269
It all depends
the way we're being filmed.

1072
01:08:27,990 --> 01:08:30,914
If the angle's wrong,
the emotion isn't transmitted.

1073
01:08:31,366 --> 01:08:33,080
We're as good as dead.

1074
01:08:33,513 --> 01:08:36,367
You have to know how to communicate.

1075
01:08:37,802 --> 01:08:41,330
And it expresses itself in the frame,
the angle and the light.

1076
01:08:52,558 --> 01:08:53,891
Jodie Foster, guys!

1077
01:08:57,260 --> 01:09:00,326
And here I am, asking:
"Why are we shooting here, Vilmos?

1078
01:09:00,604 --> 01:09:02,160
We could have stayed there."

1079
01:09:02,263 --> 01:09:05,320
Every time we took a shot, we were moving around.
Everything had to be perfect.

1080
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:07,150
Every decor.

1081
01:09:08,052 --> 01:09:11,123
If we had to make a counter-field
a mile away,

1082
01:09:12,521 --> 01:09:14,966
so we were going back
a mile away.

1083
01:09:16,552 --> 01:09:19,885
He was a perfectionist.
I'm sorry, he's a perfectionist.

1084
01:09:22,436 --> 01:09:26,027
For a scene, you needed someone
to play an old German artist.

1085
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:28,045
Who better than Vilmos?

1086
01:09:28,569 --> 01:09:31,180
He played the role of the painter.

1087
01:09:31,886 --> 01:09:34,956
And there he is,
about to be filmed.

1088
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,535
In costume

1089
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:41,460
to adjust the camera
and make sure everything was perfect.

1090
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:43,930
It's Vilmos.

1091
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,960
I loved the way he worked.

1092
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,440
I loved his style.

1093
01:10:07,422 --> 01:10:10,219
I had a lot of fun
working with him.

1094
01:10:15,368 --> 01:10:18,328
In The Witches of Eastwick.
Jack Nicholson plays the devil

1095
01:10:18,487 --> 01:10:21,019
that appeals to all three
Witches of Eastwick.

1096
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:24,844
Sarandon, Cher and Pfeiffer.

1097
01:10:25,278 --> 01:10:28,245
I was an intern. I was doing everything
the camera crew was asking me:

1098
01:10:28,348 --> 01:10:30,974
carrying the crates, cleaning the optics,
even bring the coffee.

1099
01:10:31,014 --> 01:10:33,393
We were turning in an elevator
with Michelle Pfeiffer.

1100
01:10:33,441 --> 01:10:37,649
and during a take, an assistant
has cast a shadow over Michelle.

1101
01:10:37,744 --> 01:10:39,219
No one noticed her.
except for me.

1102
01:10:39,307 --> 01:10:42,057
We had to move on,
the team was in a hurry.

1103
01:10:42,434 --> 01:10:44,973
I ran to tell Vilmos:
"There's a problem.

1104
01:10:45,505 --> 01:10:48,760
I saw Kenny's shadow.
on Michelle in the elevator."

1105
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:52,046
Vilmos, of a calm nature,
said, "What?"

1106
01:10:52,308 --> 01:10:54,224
I rehearsed:
"I saw a shadow on Michelle."

1107
01:10:54,674 --> 01:10:56,519
He looked at me and said:

1108
01:10:56,944 --> 01:10:58,562
"George, we have to do it again!"

1109
01:10:59,227 --> 01:11:00,449
The whole team's been bitching.

1110
01:11:01,254 --> 01:11:04,120
And someone threw me:
"Here's your plane ticket."

1111
01:11:04,301 --> 01:11:05,738
As if
I was on my way home.

1112
01:11:06,589 --> 01:11:10,325
Vilmos said, "Pull this plug,
I want to see her tomorrow."

1113
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:14,766
The whole crew was watching the dailies,
in 35 mm at our hotel.

1114
01:11:14,837 --> 01:11:17,745
I started to get worried.
Did I see a shadow?

1115
01:11:18,571 --> 01:11:21,657
I was terrified
to go home.

1116
01:11:22,801 --> 01:11:23,857
We watched the dailies.

1117
01:11:24,598 --> 01:11:27,131
The first take was bad.

1118
01:11:27,337 --> 01:11:30,547
And indeed, there was
a shadow on Michelle.

1119
01:11:31,102 --> 01:11:33,666
We watched the other take
and it was good.

1120
01:11:33,975 --> 01:11:35,562
Vilmos had an interesting reaction.

1121
01:11:35,639 --> 01:11:39,240
He stood up, front row,
I was in the back of the room,

1122
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:40,800
we were having a glass of wine.

1123
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,524
He said, "Jimmy, thank you very much."

1124
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,800
And I noticed that with Vilmos,

1125
01:11:48,259 --> 01:11:50,394
that was quite a way to be.

1126
01:11:51,267 --> 01:11:54,458
He was very imposing,
he had great power,

1127
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,077
he had a point of view,

1128
01:11:56,680 --> 01:12:00,645
and he was also very humble
and generous,

1129
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:03,363
and open to suggestions.

1130
01:12:04,166 --> 01:12:05,761
All the teams loved him.

1131
01:12:05,975 --> 01:12:09,542
He was firm and flexible
and he was implicating you.

1132
01:12:10,015 --> 01:12:12,045
We felt like we were doing
really part of the movie.

1133
01:12:25,608 --> 01:12:29,160
I knew Woody Allen,

1134
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:30,931
just like everybody else.

1135
01:12:32,831 --> 01:12:34,560
A famous director.

1136
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:35,960
An outstanding screenwriter.

1137
01:12:36,156 --> 01:12:38,822
Leading operators
had already worked with him

1138
01:12:41,230 --> 01:12:42,881
like Gordon Willis

1139
01:12:43,892 --> 01:12:46,920
They had turned
a dozen times together.

1140
01:12:47,152 --> 01:12:50,080
They worked well together,

1141
01:12:50,739 --> 01:12:53,000
like Ingmar Bergman
with Sven Nykvist.

1142
01:12:53,089 --> 01:12:56,811
And one day, he wanted to work
with someone else.

1143
01:12:57,750 --> 01:12:59,874
And that "someone else",
it was me.

1144
01:13:02,115 --> 01:13:04,648
When we were preparing
our second movie together.

1145
01:13:04,806 --> 01:13:06,439
Even if he didn't like the steadycam.

1146
01:13:06,551 --> 01:13:11,867
I thought we had to convince him
to try the steadycam.

1147
01:13:12,145 --> 01:13:14,156
Because it was faster

1148
01:13:14,536 --> 01:13:16,497
than setting up dolly shows.

1149
01:13:16,822 --> 01:13:18,839
I convinced him and he liked it.

1150
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,087
And for our third movie together,

1151
01:13:21,238 --> 01:13:22,246
I was very surprised

1152
01:13:22,389 --> 01:13:26,661
because he wrote the script,
thinking about steadycam.

1153
01:13:27,378 --> 01:13:31,383
He could make a plan last
indefinitely.

1154
01:13:31,497 --> 01:13:33,777
On a page or two
of dialogue.

1155
01:13:33,873 --> 01:13:35,833
His staging was incredible.

1156
01:13:35,858 --> 01:13:40,729
He knows to show
the setting of its history

1157
01:13:40,809 --> 01:13:43,261
So, sometimes he starts
with a wide shot.

1158
01:13:43,676 --> 01:13:46,207
Then the camera tightens up
about two people

1159
01:13:46,372 --> 01:13:48,323
and maybe finishes
with a close-up.

1160
01:13:49,221 --> 01:13:52,921
He's letting the story unfold.
It's good for the actors.

1161
01:13:52,993 --> 01:13:56,604
They can play their part
like in the theater.

1162
01:14:02,462 --> 01:14:05,652
One day Woody says to me:
"You don't need a crane for this scene."

1163
01:14:06,279 --> 01:14:08,680
"But Woody, it won't take
than ten seconds

1164
01:14:08,721 --> 01:14:11,629
and you'll see what happens.
in the story."

1165
01:14:11,775 --> 01:14:12,920
"I don't know,

1166
01:14:13,021 --> 01:14:14,711
I don't like turning with a crane."

1167
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:16,775
We're still shooting with it.

1168
01:14:16,883 --> 01:14:20,005
The next day,
we went to see the dailies.

1169
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:22,430
He said to me:

1170
01:14:23,915 --> 01:14:25,580
"I'm not going to be able
use this plan."

1171
01:14:26,464 --> 01:14:27,766
I asked him, "Why?"

1172
01:14:28,620 --> 01:14:30,692
He said to me:
"This is too Hollywood."

1173
01:14:40,024 --> 01:14:42,516
We installed a backlight,
I'll turn it off.

1174
01:14:43,298 --> 01:14:45,257
It's all right. It's okay. It's okay.
It's not a fiction film.

1175
01:14:45,282 --> 01:14:46,384
- All right. All right, all right.
- It's all right. It's okay.

1176
01:14:46,409 --> 01:14:47,606
Do what you like.

1177
01:14:49,454 --> 01:14:50,567
Somebody's calling me.

1178
01:14:50,930 --> 01:14:55,501
I'm in front of the camera,
in the usual place.

1179
01:17:24,539 --> 01:17:29,603
Adaptation: Anna Le Clézio
Pierre Filmon and Marc Olry
