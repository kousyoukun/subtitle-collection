‐Werewolfy Pluto...
‐[barks, howls]

175
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,427
Hi, Junior Witches!

176
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,513
How's the training
going at the Academy?

177
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,515
Today's our big Witchy Tests!

178
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:57,102
And if we pass, we'll both
get to be real witches!

179
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,603
‐Sounds swell!
‐[howls]

180
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,813
Count Mickula!

181
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:01,981
How's your new song
coming along?

182
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,776
We can't wait to hear
it at the Boo Bash tonight!

183
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,403
It wouldn't be
Halloween without

184
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:09,614
Count Mickula
and the Monsters' big new song!

185
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,325
I, um, don't have
my new song yet!

186
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,119
[all] You don't?!

187
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,079
I'm having trouble coming up
with the new song,

188
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,581
but inspiration
will strike soon...

189
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,875
[chuckles]
I... I hope.

190
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,254
Well, in‐spee‐ration
better make it snappy,

191
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:27,132
'cause when
the Monster Clock
strikes thirteen,

192
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,509
it'll be time for
every goblin and ghost

193
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,428
to shake their "boo"‐ties.

194
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:32,804
H'yuck!

195
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,682
Well, we'll see you later
at the Boo Bash!

196
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,559
We have to get back
to the Witch Academy!

197
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,519
To take our big tests!

198
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,645
‐[gulps]
‐[Count Mickula chuckles]

199
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,480
I'll bet you'll both
graduate tonight

200
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,316
and become
great witches!

201
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:48,486
Let's hope Witch Master
Clarabelle thinks so, too!

202
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,488
[all] Good luck!

203
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,450
And good luck coming up
with your big Halloween song!

204
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,538
[Pete the Ghost]
<i>Fa‐boo‐lous!</i>

205
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:02,042
Tonight's gonna be my
lucky fright night, fellas!

206
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,251
Look, Bony!

207
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:06,796
Tonight's the big Halloween
Kooky Spook Contest

208
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,758
at the Boo Bash!
[laughs] See?

209
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,217
[sighs]

210
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,928
‐[whines]
‐Oh, Butchy boy!

211
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:17,640
Now you remember that Kooky
Spook Contest I lost last year?

212
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,642
And the year before that?

213
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,979
And the year before that?
Well, you get the point.

214
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,441
I guess I just wasn't
kooky‐spooky enough!

215
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:27,984
[barks]

216
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:31,196
Well tonight, I'm gonna win!

217
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:35,909
You see, I come from
a long line of winners!

218
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:40,789
And for once in my afterlife,
I'm gonna make my family proud!

219
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:42,707
[barks]

220
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,375
Oh, I won't lose.

221
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,794
Because this year,

222
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:48,922
I've been practicing
my scary new moves!

223
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,548
[laughs] Get a load of this!

224
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:54,094
[spooky moan]

225
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,888
Wa‐waa.

226
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,682
Well, I'm still working on it.

227
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:00,975
Come on, Butch!

228
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:04,062
Let's go sign up
for that contest,

229
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:08,733
because tonight, I'll be
the spooky ghost with the most!

230
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,735
Ooh... Whoa!

231
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:14,239
Rats! Why can't I go through
things like other ghosts?!

232
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:19,744
[groans] Oh, I'll never
remember these spells!

233
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,372
Junior Witches,

234
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:25,041
Junior Witches, it's time for
Witch test number one:

235
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,377
Casting a Spell!

236
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:29,712
Minnie the Wonderful,

237
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,714
please step up to the cauldron.

238
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,842
Now if you want to
cast a spell,

239
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:36,803
just concentrate
and do it well!

240
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,763
Stir the cauldron
nice and light,

241
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,974
for your spell
to come out right!

242
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,517
[meows]

243
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:45,687
Bubbles, bubbles,
now you rise.

244
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:48,398
Give us all a big surprise,

245
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:52,443
And conjure up some...
butterflies!

246
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,820
[popping]

247
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,321
‐Wow!
‐[meows]

248
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,447
[gasps] It worked!

249
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:57,824
[giggles]

250
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,663
Very good,
Minnie the Wonderful!

251
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,875
Now it's your turn,
Daisy Doozy!

252
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,543
You've got this!

253
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:11,004
Okay! Here it goes!

254
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,970
I gotta do this, I just gotta!

255
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:24,225
Bubbling cauldron,
heed my powers!

256
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,311
Make <i>me</i> a bouquet
of pretty flowers!

257
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:30,982
‐Oh, dear!
‐Yiye!

258
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,942
Oh, Daisy Doodles!

259
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,153
Daisy Doozy,

260
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,448
you passed this test...

261
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,658
barely.

262
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,911
Oh. Thank you.

263
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,079
See, Daisy?
You can do this!

264
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,581
Bah‐room!

265
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:49,584
Okay, Junior Witches!

266
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:53,254
Grab your Zoom‐Brooms, because
it's time for test number two:

267
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:56,257
Witchy flying!

268
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,426
‐[gulps, whimpers]
‐Good luck, Minnie.

269
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,719
You can do this!

270
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,138
Oh! I hope so.

271
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,355
Have lots of fun, girls!

272
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,194
‐[Daisy and Spooky Loca] Ahh!
‐Whoa! [groans]

273
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:22,659
Junior Witches, I want you
to do a kooky corkscrew roll!

274
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:23,952
[both] We're on it!

275
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,496
Whee‐hee‐hee!

276
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,123
‐[meows]
‐Whoa! [giggles]

277
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,918
Well done!

278
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,671
Now combine your
kooky corkscrew roll

279
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:37,382
with a witchy loopty‐loop
spooky swoop!

280
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:38,883
Oh, okay.

281
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,218
Here I go!

282
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:44,013
Ahh! Whoa! Whoa!!
[grunts]

283
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:48,142
Hm. Her loopty‐loop
was a bit sloopy‐sloppy,

284
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,061
but her swoop
was simply swoo‐per!

285
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,062
[chuckles]

286
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,564
Your turn, Daisy!

287
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:54,732
Got it!

288
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,445
Ahh!

289
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:03,116
[laughs]

290
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,868
Whaa!

291
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,996
‐Whoa!
‐[Daisy laughs]

292
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,375
[laughing]

293
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:15,253
Good job, Daisy Doozy!

294
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,008
Oh, you were terrific,
Daisy Doozy!

295
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:22,844
Thanks, Minnie!
You did great, too!

296
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:25,680
Now let's moo‐ve on
to test number three:

297
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,473
Floatation Levitation!

298
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,142
Follow me!

299
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,394
"Floatation levitation"?

300
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,895
Oh, no!

301
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,648
That one's always been
hard for me!

302
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:39,110
Knowing you, Daisy,
I bet you can do
better than you think.

303
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,737
Just try your best!

304
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:41,863
Okay!

305
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,950
<i>♪ You gotta chomp</i>
<i>Chomp, chomp ♪</i>

306
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,202
♪ <i>And do the Monster Stomp</i> ♪

307
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,581
So, what do you guys think?

308
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:56,127
Gawrsh! It sounds just like
that song we played last year!

309
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,337
It is the song
we played last year!

310
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,131
[whines]

311
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:02,175
[sighs] You're right.

312
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,594
We've got our stage set up,
we've got our jack‐o'‐lantern,

313
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,138
but we still need a song!

314
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,644
Ahh! Whoo!
[giggles]

315
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,149
Uh‐oh!

316
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:19,442
Look at those boulders!

317
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:24,072
Oh! They're blocking
the road to the Boo Bowl!

318
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,199
Which is why this is
the perfect place

319
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,825
for test number three:

320
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:30,411
Floatation Levitation!

321
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:36,334
Junior Witches,
to pass this test,

322
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:39,045
each of you must moo‐ve
one of these boulders

323
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:42,173
up to the tippity‐top
of the mountain!

324
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,967
‐Dizzy doodles!
‐[Figaro cries]

325
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,427
All the way up there?

326
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,179
Exactly!

327
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:50,723
Use your mind to concentrate,

328
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,102
and you can make
anything float and levitate!

329
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,812
Okay!

330
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:58,231
Giant boulder, feel my will!

331
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,316
Float up to that big old hill!

332
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,611
Please keep moving,
do not stop!

333
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,781
Until you reach
the mountain top!

334
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,742
You did it, Daisy!

335
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,160
‐Whoo‐hoo!
‐[meows]

336
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,668
‐You're next!
‐You've got this, Minnie!

337
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,711
Okay! Here I go!

338
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,840
Giant boulder, before my eyes!

339
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,926
Shrink down to
a tiny size!

340
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,472
Uh‐oh!

341
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,937
[meows]

342
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,107
Now that is very clever...
or as I like to say,

343
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,151
"You're thinking
outside the Cauldron!"

344
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:44,235
[chuckles]

345
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,783
We accidentally
started an avalanche!

347
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,582
Oh, no!
The boys are in trouble!

348
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,043
Oh, no! That rock
is heading towards

349
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,670
Count Mickula

Oh, gosh.

356
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,021
I gotta come up
with a big new song

357

Now that's what I call
Halloween magic!

367
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,050
And that's worthy of the
highest grade you can get...

368
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,427
a gold star!

369
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,722

Oh, congratulations,

371
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:01,729
Ooh! I have to find my own way
to wow Witch Master Clarabelle

372
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,397
and get my own gold star.

373
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,399
Then you better
ace the next test!

374
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,985
It's the last one.
And if you don't pass it,

375
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,195
you won't graduate!

376
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,909
I bet I could pass if I had
a wand of my own...

377
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:17,203
like Witch Master
Clarabelle's.

378

We didn't mean
to hurt your feelings!

404
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:26,063
Well, fellas, we still
need a new song,

405
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,232
so let's get back to work!

our Jacky‐Lantern?

of Halloween

all over Haunted Hills.

Sorry Butch,
but I don't feel like playin'.

for your final test,

469
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:17,026
I'd like you to decorate
Spooky Street any way you like,

470
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:20,446
as long as it screams
Halloween!

471
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:23,199
Oh, I'll make some
cute bat bows!

472
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,534
And I'll put up lots of
pumpkin lanterns.

473
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,666
And you must be finished
before the hourglass runs out.

00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:36,128

impossible!

Where there's a witch,
there's a way!

I guess I'll decorate
the right side of the street!

481
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,189
Okay. I'll take the left side!

482
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:58,275
Oh! If only we had
our own magic wands!

483
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,361
Then I could use mine
to decorate.

484
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:02,071
It'd be so much easier!

485
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,198
Why are you so worried, Daisy?

486
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:06,242
You've done decorating
like this before‐‐

487
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:07,743
without a magic wand!

488
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,496
But now my graduation
depends on it!

489
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:13,999
If I fail this test, I won't
get to be a real witch
with you!

490
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,001
Then let's do our Witchy best,

491
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,420

Ahh!

526

[gasps]

527
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,878
What a doozy disaster!

528
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:43,047
Daisy, are you okay?

529
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:45,424
You sure doozied up
that one, Butch.

530
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:46,675
[whimpers]

531
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:47,968
[Minnie] But how
did this happen?

532
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,470
Creepers!

533
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,639
Maybe I added
too many decorations.

534
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:53,474
That's why everything
fell down!

535
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:55,517
I don't think
it's your fault, Daisy.

536
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:58,395
But maybe if we hurry,
we can fix it.

537
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,855
[ringing]

538
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,901
I'm back, Junior Witches.

539
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:06,320
Let's see how you did
on your final test.

540
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,822
Oh! What happened here?!

541
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:14,828
Oh, I can explain!
You see, I‐‐

542
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,373
Oh, I'm sorry, Daisy Doozy!

543
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,458
but you tried your best.

544
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:23,921
[buzzer sounds]

545
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:29,760
Junior Witches,
your Witchy Tests are over.

546
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,428
Tonight at the Boo Bash,

547
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,764
I will announce
who will be graduating

548
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:36,684
to finally become
a real witch.

549
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:37,977
But before I go,

550
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,770
let's tidy things up a bit.

551
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,064
Bibbity‐Boppity‐Moo!

552
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,109
Ooh!

553
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,572
Wow‐wee!

554
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:53,158
If that wand can make
the streets spooky,

555
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,370
I bet it can do
the same for me!

556
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:59,123
Time to try on my new Moo Moo!

557
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:01,041
See you both at
the Boo Bash!

558
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:06,463
[sighs]
My Witchy career is over.

559
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,257
I'm never graduating!

560
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,633
Oh, don't say that.

561
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,176
There's still a chance!

562
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:14,722
Yeah! Your spells
did come out okay.

563
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:16,390
Kinda‐sorta.

564
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,267
And your broom flying
is the best!

565
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,477
Thanks, but it
won't be good enough

566
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,604
to help me graduate
with you, Minnie.

567
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:30,487
If only there were a way I
could conjure up something big

568
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,656
to impress
Witch Master Clarabelle!

569
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:35,451
Then she'd know I'm ready
to be a real witch!

570
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:37,494
Oh, Daisy Doozy,

571
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:40,289
you'll be a great witch
no matter what happens today.

572
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:43,000
Oh, you really think so?

573
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,501
I know so!

574
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:47,421
Well, at least one of us knows!

575
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:50,924
Say, why don't we get back
and get ready for the party?

576
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,844
I have a surprise
that will cheer you up!

577
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,598
You know, Minnie,

578
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:59,767
you really are
a wonderful witch...

579
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:01,727
and a wonderful friend.

580
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:04,480
Oh, you too!
[giggles]

581
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:08,025
Hear that, Butchie?

582
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,651
While they get all gussied up,

583
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:12,279
I can sneak into the castle
and swipe that

584
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,948
bibbity‐boppity Moo Wand!
[laughs]

585
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,200
[barks]

586
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,285
And once I get that wand,

587
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:22,414
I'll use it to turn myself
into something big and spooky!

588
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,542
[chuckles] This town will
never laugh at me again!

589
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:32,132
Daisy Doozy,
here's your surprise!

590
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:35,761
Ta‐da! I made us matching
witchy bows for the party!

591
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:38,430
Oh, they're beautiful, Minnie,

592
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,350
but... [sighs]
I might not be needing it.

593
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,768
‐[meows]
‐Daisy,

594
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,937
you are not going to
give up hope!

595
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:47,856
There's still a chance
you'll become a real witch!

596
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,817
Thanks for the pep talk,
Minnie,

597
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:51,735
but I think it would take
a magical miracle

598
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,403
for me to graduate.

599
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,197
I really need to
think about this.

600
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:01,411
Hmm, maybe I should talk to
Witch Master Clarabelle

601
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:04,039
and see if there's anything
more I can do.

602
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,499
It's worth a try!

603
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:08,460
[Clarabelle] Oh, cobwebs!

604
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,755
I need to find the most
boo‐tiful dress to wear tonight

605
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,216
Now which dress should I wear?

606
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:18,512
Oh! The moo wand!

607
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:21,098
I'd better get this back to
Witch Master Clarabelle
right away!

608
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,060
Ooh, this wand is wonderful!

609
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,605
But no. No. No, Daisy Doozy,

610
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,399
you've got to return it!

611
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,317
[Clarabelle]
Oh, fuzzle‐buzzle!

612
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:35,153
This dress just
isn't working out.
[grunts]

613
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:38,532
Ooh! She seems very busy.

614
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:41,243
I guess I shouldn't
disturb her, but...

615
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,203
Wait, it wouldn't hurt
if I just tried out

616
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,080
the Moo Wand
a little, right?

617
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,790
Maybe I could
whip up some magic

618
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,000
and make something
amazing

619
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,377
to impress
Witch Master Clarabelle.

620
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:53,005
Yeah! Then I'll bring
the Wand back to her.

621
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,715
And she'll graduate me
for sure!

622
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:56,008
Goody good plan!

623
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,885
Well, I've got
a better one!

624
00:27:57,885 --> 00:28:00,304
‐No! I do!
‐No! I do!

625
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:02,222
‐No, I do.
‐I do!

626
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,599
‐I do!
‐I do!

627
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:04,933
[arguing continues]

628
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,101
Ah!

629
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,686
[growls]

630
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,480
‐[laughs]
‐Come back here with that wand!

631
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,107

633
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,569
Where'd she go?

634
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:17,362
[pants]

635
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,909
[exclaims]
Moldy cheese weasels!

636
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:24,036
She out‐ghosted me!

637
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:26,330
Well, I ain't gonna
let her get away

638
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,165
with what
I was gonna steal!

639
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:29,833
[barks]

640
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:34,880
Ooh, I can't wait to do some
momentous magic and‐‐ ghaa!

641
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,800
Daisy! What are you doing
with that moo wand?

642
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,219
Shh! I'm borrowing it.

643
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,889
If I can cast a big spell
or something,

644
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,891
I'll prove to
Witch Master Clarabelle

645
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:47,601
that I <i>can</i> be a real Witch!

646
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:50,103
But that's just batty!

647
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:53,023
Hey! Where ya' goin'?
Get back here!

648
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:56,026
Sorry, Spooky Loca,
but this is my only chance!

649
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:57,778
I've got Witchy Magic to make!

650
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,200
Magic Moo‐Wand,
what I need‐‐

651
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,202
Get me flying
at super speed!

652
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:09,039
It worked! Whee‐hee‐hee!

653
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,874
Yikes! I gotta tell Minnie!

654
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:20,926
Now let's see!
What spooky spell

655
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:24,805
can I conjure up to make this
Boo Bash bigger than ever?

656
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:25,847
[gasps] What's that?

657
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:29,017
Nothing screams
Halloween like a pumpkin patch!

658
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,770
I'll start there!
[cackles]

659
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,814
[coughs]

660
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:36,108
I gotta work on that cackle!

661
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:38,151
Let's hurry, fellas!

662
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,820
We gotta find
a pumpkin to replace

663
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,446
our broken Jack‐O'‐Lantern

664
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,823
and get back to the stage!

665
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:44,449
Oh! I still have to figure out

666
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,243
what our new big song
is gonna be!

667
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:50,747
Yes! This is perfect!

668
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:54,334
There must be a way
to use these pumpkins

669
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,920
to show Witch Master
Clarabelle what I can do!

670
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:02,009
‐We gotta get that wand!
‐[barks]

671
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,885
If I make the Boo Bash
better than ever,

672
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,095
I'll be a hero!

673
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:06,596
Witch Master Clarabelle

674
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,932
‐might even throw me a parade!
‐[bell dings]

675
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,977
That's it! I'll make a
Halloween Pumpkin parade!

676
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,937
Jump and dance,
don't be delayed!

677
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,982
Join the
Happy Pumpkin parade!

678
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:24,072
All right, pumpkins!
On my command!

679
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,783
Time for us
to strike up the band!

680
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:29,995
[all] Huh?

681
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,163
[all] Ahh!

682
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,957
Goody good Witch! I did it!

683
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:36,543
If only Minnie and Spooky
could see me now!

684
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:39,838
This magical magic
is going to help me graduate!

685
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,798
The girls will be so surprised!

686
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,341
[Spooky‐Loca]
And shocked!

687
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,927
Daisy Doozy,
what are you doing?!

688
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,305
I'm making
a Happy Pumpkin Parade

689
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:50,223
to kick off tonight's Boo Bash!

690
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,850
Don't you love it?

691
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,895
We're gonna get
squashed by a squash!
Ahh!

692
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:56,897
Daisy!
We have get the Moo Wand

693
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:59,441
back to
Witch Master Clarabelle!

694
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:02,986
But this is my chance to show
her that I can be a real witch!

695
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,696
I thought you'd be
happy for me!

696
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,491
But it's not right to use
another Witch's wand,

697
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:09,743
especially
Witch Master Clarabelle's!

698
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:13,413
‐Why can't I have
a chance to show off?
‐[Minnie] "Show off"?

699
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,499
[Daisy] Like the way you
flew in to save Count Mickula

700
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:17,876
and the boys
from the avalanche!

701
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,294
But they were in trouble!

702
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,713
It's a Good Witch's duty
to help others!

703
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,507
Well, I just want to help
myself prove that

704
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:25,425
I can be a good witch, too!
[gasps]

705
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,552
[Minnie and Daisy]
The wand!

706
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,430
Thank you very much!

707
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,308
Pete! That belongs to
Witch Master Clarabelle,

708
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,102
so give it back!

709
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:38,063
Sorry, finders <i>creepers!</i>

710
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:40,565
You heard 'em, Pete!
Give them the wand back!

711
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:43,026
‐[all] Yeah!
‐Oh, really?

712
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,319
Who's gonna make me?

713
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,821
[Clarabelle] I am!

714
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:49,032
[Pete]
Witch Master Clarabelle!

715
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,784
Oh!

716
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:55,122
Obey me now, Pete,
on my command!

717
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:58,542
Release my Moo Wand
to my hand!

718
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,502
Whoa!

719
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:01,670
Hyah!

720
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:05,382
[Pete] It's fun to spin,
don't you know?

721
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:07,175
Round and round...

722
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:10,011
‐Put me down!
‐Well, down you go!

723
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:14,266
Whoa! [grunts, groans]

724
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:17,727
Pete, don't!
Give me my Moo Wand!

725
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:20,230
Hey, hey, hey,
bounce, bounce away!

726
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:23,733
Pete, this isn't funny!

727
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,819
You've taken this joke too far!

728
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,279
Did you say "joke"?

729
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,990
[chuckles]
This ain't no joke.

730
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:34,536
I'm gonna show you all
how big and spooky I can be!

731
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:43,128
Pumpkin, pumpkin,
watch 'em spin!

732
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:46,715
My transformation
will now begin!

733
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:49,593
Show 'em on
this Halloween Night

734
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:52,846
a Pete‐O'Lantern
full of fright!

735
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,018
[all gasp]

736
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:03,607
[wicked laugh]

737
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:07,027
Pretty cool!

738
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:10,697
The Kooky Spooky contest
will be starting soon!

739
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:11,865
Come on, Butch!

740
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:16,244
Let's go show this town
the new and spooky me!

741
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:21,041
‐[evil laugh]
‐[whimpers]

742
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:24,002
What? You don't
like me like this?

743
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,879
Okay, fine!

744
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:28,256
You can stay here with
all the other scaredy cats!

745
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:31,176
‐Stop right there, pumpkin!
‐[yelps]

746
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:34,638
Give me my Moo Wand back
you big, silly squash!

747
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:36,223
Wha‐‐? Ow!

748
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:38,725
Oh, that tickles.
[laughs] Let me go!

749
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,688
[whimpers]

750
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,190
I know, Pluto,

751
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,859
big and spooky Pete
witch‐napped Clarabelle!

752
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,862
But Minnie and Daisy
will save the day!

753
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,657
‐I hope.
‐[whimpers]

754
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:57,661
Hurry! We have to save
Witch Master Clarabelle!

755
00:33:57,661 --> 00:34:01,081
‐How can we help?
‐Pete is heading downtown.
So meet us there.

756
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:03,750
In the meantime, we'll figure
out a Witchy Way

757
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,460
to turn Pete back into a ghost!

758
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,336
Let's get a‐goin'!

759
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,630
Aw, phooey!

760
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:12,050
Oh, Minnie! Witch Master
Clarabelle's in trouble

761
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,927
and it's all my fault!

762
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:15,679
I've got to make this right!

763
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,430
Do you think I can do this?

764
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,766
I don't think‐‐
I know!

765
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:23,228
We're going to make this
right, Daisy Doozy, together!

766
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:24,479
Because...

767
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,690
That's what best friends do!

768
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,566
That's the spirit!
[giggles]

769
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,444
So let's use all of
our magic to stop Pete

770
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:33,905
and save
Witch Master Clarabelle!

771
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,074
Good plan! But how?

772
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,826
Pete's got the Moo Wand!

773
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:39,119
Where there's a witch...

774
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,996
...there's a way!

775
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:43,415
And now it's up to us
to find the way...

776
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:46,042
and the Wand!
[whistles]

777
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,004
You drive!

778
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:50,422
[both] Whoo‐hoo!

779
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:54,592
[whimpers]

780
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,722
‐[screaming]
‐[Pete cackles]

781
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:11,234
Why are we running <i>towards</i>
the big scary jacky‐lantern?

782
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,528
Because we have to help
Minnie and Daisy

783
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,030
save Witch Master Clarabelle!

784
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,906
‐[Pete roars]
‐[all] Whoa!

785
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:21,119
Pete, This is not
[laughing] funny!

786
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,371
[laughs]
Release me at once!

787
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:27,667
I'm gonna show this
entire town how spooky I am!

788
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,003
[both] Not if we
Junior Witches stop you!

789
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:33,089
Huh? [roars]

790
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,383
Looks like the witches
have a plan.

791
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,635
Maybe I can help.

792
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,598
Trick or Treat!

793
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:43,683
Smell my feet!

794
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:48,021
Get ready to meet
the spooky new Pete!

795
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,774
[groans, exclaims]

796
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:53,234
You wretched witches!

797
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:56,905
So what's the plan,
Junior Witches?

798
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:59,866
First we find a way
to free Witch Master Clarabelle

799
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:02,243
from those
creepy‐ crawly vines!

800
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:04,287
Good idea!
Then we'll find a way to take

801
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,247
the Moo Wand from those vines!

802
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:07,624
Leave that to me!

803
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:13,713
[laughs]
Oh, Count Mickula!

804
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:16,508
Make Pete get these
vines away from me!

805
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:19,636
Don't you worry!
I'll get right to the point!

806
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,221
[chuckles]

807
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,473
‐[chomps]
‐Owie!

808
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,225
Ooh!

809
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:26,851
[cheering]

810
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,645
We've got you,
Witch Master Clarabelle!

811
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:31,189
Oh, thank goodness!

812
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,441
‐Oh, no you don't!
You get back here!
‐[meows]

813
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,860
You wacky witches!

814
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:46,204
Where'd ya go, little Witchies?
[laughs]

815
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:49,833
Don't you want to see
how spooky I can be?!

816
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:54,879
If Minnie and Daisy don't get
the wand away from Pete,

817
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,590
Happy Haunt Hills
will never be happy again!

818
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,092
[whimpers]

819
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:02,679
[Clarabelle]
Oh, dear! Stop the broom!

820
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:05,014
Witch Master Clarabelle!
How do you feel?

821
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,392
Like a milkshake!

822
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:09,144
Witch Master Clarabelle,

823
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:11,229
I'm sorry for causing
this big mess.

824
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:14,023
It was wrong for me
to take your wand.

825
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:17,193
And Minnie, I'm sorry
for being so selfish.

826
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:20,238
You believed in me when
I didn't even believe in me.

827
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,365
But you never
stopped believing.

828
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,409
And I never will stop!

829
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:28,329
I... I just wanted to prove
that I could be a good witch.

830
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:29,956
A great witch.

831
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,959
A wonderful witch...
just like you.

832
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,753
Oh, Daisy.

833
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,921
Some of the best things I know
about being a good witch

834
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,132
are things I learned from you!

835
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:41,176
And it's your friendship
that makes

836
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:44,012
some very powerful magic!

837
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:46,181
[both]
It does?... It does!

838
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:47,891
You know, I can feel it!

839
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:51,311
Using our magic together
makes us‐‐

840
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:53,772
and our friendship‐‐
even stronger!

841
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:55,565
‐Yes!
‐Um...

842
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:57,066
hate to ruin the moment, girls,

843
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,359
but could we celebrate later?

844
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,737
First we gotta get that
Wand away from Pete!

845
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:02,030
‐[Pete cackles]
‐[screaming]

846
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,948
Peek‐a‐boo!

847
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:08,453
Did I scare you?
[evil laugh]

848
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:10,497
Buttons and Broomsticks!

849
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:12,290
He's scaring everybody!

850
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,042
There must be a way
to stop him!

851
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:18,213
[meows]

852
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:21,716
Oh, Figaro! Now's not
the time to play with ribbon!

853
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,219
Maybe it is! Look!

854
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:27,013
If we can make a big trap
out of ribbon,

855
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,640
Pete will get all tangled up!

856
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,017
And we can take back
the Moo Wand!

857
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,311
Ya' know, it just might work!

858
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,897
But we need something
a lot stronger than ribbon!

859
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:37,524
My Junior Witches!

860
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:40,360
You must use every
Witchy Lesson you ever learned

861
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,945
to stop Pete!

862
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:44,948
If not, Halloween
will be ruined!

863
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:46,282
Where there's a Witch...

864
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,203
[all] there's a way!

865
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:52,747
Oh, little Witchies!

866
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,834
Come out, come out

[laughs]

868
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:04,551
So how do we stop Pumpkin Pete
and his spooky vines?

869
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:05,844
While you boys distract him,

870
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:08,012
we'll set this tricky trap!

871
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,723
But we'll need
one little thing.

872
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,892
Donald, may we borrow
your bandages?

873
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,727
Oh, no you don't!

874
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,563
Aw, phooey!

875

[chuckles]
Thanks, Donald!

876
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,817
Hey, Pete! Up here!

877
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:23,236
So there you are!

878
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:26,447
Well, ready to give up,
Witchy Poo?

879
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:30,326
‐Never!
‐[whimpering]
You d‐d‐d‐don't scare us!

880

881
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:35,748
Hey! Wait a second!

882
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:38,084
Where'd those two other
witches go?

883
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:45,383
Nice try, but you can't
trick the trickster!

884
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,553
[both]
Faster, faster! Witches Wind!

885
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:51,222

889
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:03,192
Use your mind to concentrate!

890
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:06,154
[Daisy] And you can make
anything levitate!

891

Make me proud, girls!

900
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:40,855

ruined Halloween!

911

Aw, I'm sorry!

912
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:22,188
I wasn't tryin' to be
a big scary monster.

913
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:25,984
I was just wantin' to be a
spooky ghost

914
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:28,945
so's I could win
the Kooky‐Spooky Contest!

915

Gee, uh, we're sorry, too.

916
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:32,949
For hurting your feelings.

We didn't mean to!

You mean...
I get to graduate, too?

Yes, my dear.

935
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:19,454
You may have not passed
all your tests the first time,

936
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:22,248
but when I and the rest of
the town needed you,

937
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:24,083
you came through and proved

938
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:27,712

a real witch!

you saved Halloween,
you saved the Boo Bash

943

and... you both have taught me

944
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:43,519

powerful magic of all!
