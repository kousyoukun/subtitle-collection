1
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:41,291
There's obviously a mistake.

2
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:43,791
We were notified the passes
would be waiting in our names.

3
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:45,625
I'm sorry, but that's incorrect.

4
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,833
- Morf Vandewalt, Artweb.
- No. It's today...

5
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,333
Hey, Morf.

6
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:52,201
Okay, I wanna speak
to someone in charge, please.

7
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,500
- Lovely to see you again.
- This is ridiculous.

8
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:57,208
We bought Shogrun's Ultraworld
last month in New York.

9
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,750
Have you ever felt invisible?

10
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,666
Once, I built a railroad.

11
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:55,833
- There he is. Morf.
- Cloudio.

12
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:59,375
It's Kenji, you probably know.
It's titled Hoboman.

13
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:00,833
The response is amazing.

14
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,625
- Arguably, the hit of the show.
- Hmm.

15
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,333
Wolfson, Female Figure, four years ago.

16
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:07,750
No, it's new.
Vastly different themes.

17
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,166
It's an iteration.

18
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,000
No originality. No courage.
My opinion.

19
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,763
Well, I absolutely respect
the power of your point of view,

20
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,500
but this encompasses on a global scale.

21
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,543
There's just such a sense of now
and in your face,

22
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,666
which speaks to pop and cinema
and economics.

23
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,916
I mean, you can feel the winds
of the apocalypse.

24
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,208
I can't save you.

25
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:28,541
We have a four-million-dollar hold,
a major buyer in Shanghai.

26
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,208
Will you be running your review today?

27
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,476
- Hey.
- Do you have a minute?

28
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,166
No, I'm just heading inside now.

29
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,625
- I have to tell you something about Ricky.
- What?

30
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,375
- Josephina, he's cheating on you.
- Are you serious?

31
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,916
- I saw him with this girl.
- When?

32
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,375
Last night at a bar.

33
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,875
- What?
- They were both pretty drunk.

34
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,458
- Wha... What time?
- I don't know. Ten?

35
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:06,083
- They were all over each other.
- Right at the fucking bar.

36
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,833
- I'm so sorry, Josephina.
- Are you sure it was him?

37
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,416
They were standing right next to me.

38
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,541
I gotta go.

39
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:12,916
- Anything I can do?
- No.

40
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,250
Uh, thank you, seriously. Bye.

41
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,916
- Howzit, Morf?
- Hello, Jon.

42
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,458
Really something, eh?

43
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,750
Is Piers sleeping with Dorothy?

44
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:26,166
Oh, I'm certain
you'd have to ask him that.

45
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,875
Excuse me.

46
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,250
- Morf, love.
- Oh, Gretchen.

47
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:37,125
We bid on it for the museum.
Jon wants three point seven.

48
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,088
Rhodora would never
sell a Piers for under five,

49
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,541
so it's a nice opportunity for us.

50
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,916
I'm quite curious to know what you think.

51
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,458
I think sober hasn't been good for him.

52
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,250
Well, this was done fifteen years ago.

53
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,958
Piers was in the full bloom
of alcoholism here.

54
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:50,958
Exactly.

55
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,791
So, you're saying it is a good buy
for the museum, then?

56
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,208
Excuse me.

57
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,458
Josephina.

58
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,250
Are you okay?

59
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,208
Literally, the worst fucking day.

60
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,125
Ugh, your makeup.

61
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,916
God, I'm late.
They texted, like, twenty times.

62
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,250
I'm headed there, too.

63
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,458
God, fucking people.

64
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,333
- Who?
- Everyone.

65
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,750
Is Piers switching galleries?

66
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,750
I answer phones and get coffee.
I'd literally be, like, the last to know.

67
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,250
You're too late.
Rhodora already got her coffee.

68
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,500
Are you where you wanna be?

69
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,333
I'm not taking shit from the installer.

70
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,083
What did you think?

71
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,458
I haven't felt that in years.

72
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,250
- Morf is here.
- Oh, thank you. Excuse me.

73
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,333
Well?

74
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,500
Color. Life.

75
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:53,833
I love it.

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,833
I'm sick of white spaces.

77
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,375
That is so strange.

78
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:00,916
I've been drawn to a bolder booth presence
in terms of work and palette lately.

79
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:04,541
Mm-hmm. This adherence to showing
in sterile, monochrome cubes.

80
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:08,250
It's just laziness.
I wanted to get some juxtaposition going.

81
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:11,833
I'm actually, I mean right now,
writing something exactly about this.

82
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,625
- This wasn't in the catalog.
- Mm-mm.

83
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:18,916
It's Minkins.

84
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,333
It's called Sphere.

85
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:26,250
It creates this unique sensation,

86
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:30,416
depending on each person
and whatever hole they decide to explore.

87
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,375
Just like life.

88
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:35,166
It uses all sorts of sensors and gizmos.

89
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,291
Ooh!

90
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:39,791
It's about choice, desire, sex.

91
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,541
The whole enchilada.

92
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,458
- It's groundbreaking.
- Hmm, it's yours to break.

93
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,250
Debuted ten minutes ago.

94
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,958
I'm posting a review. How much is it?

95
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:52,083
So much easier to talk about
money than art.

96
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,166
Funny.

97
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:57,208
Speaking of, is Piers leaving you
for Jon Dondon?

98
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:00,166
I've represented Piers
for seventeen years.

99
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:01,833
That's not an answer.

100
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:05,208
Well, why don't you put your hand in?

101
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,583
See what you feel.

102
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,208
- It's just not worth my investment.
- You're mistaken.

103
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,750
This is gonna be an uncommon
event experience,

104
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,458
not to mention the tax incentive.

105
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,791
- Is there water in Miami?
- At the bar, sir.

106
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,500
- I don't know.
- Fuck.

107
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:31,458
I can guarantee your position
as co-chair... Oh, excuse me.

108
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:32,500
Piers.

109
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:36,541
I was floating in the ocean,
and, for this incredible moment,

110
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:40,583
it felt like I had tapped into
a primal consciousness.

111
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:45,291
A connection to the world
in its purest form.

112
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,583
Ricky's still denying it.

113
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:53,250
"Please, baby, let me explain."
I swear to God, I want to hurt him.

114
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,583
Maybe it will free you up for new things.

115
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,125
This was a new thing. He'd just moved in.

116
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:04,000
I have to say, I'm having my own
major second thoughts about Ed.

117
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:07,541
He actually has some fantasy
about us getting married.

118
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,333
I'm through dating artists.

119
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,333
They're already in a relationship.

120
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,750
Look, Damrish,

121
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:17,458
your website doesn't give
a sense of scale or texture.

122
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:20,625
But seeing your work in person
at the new-artists fair,

123
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,916
I had that "Oh, my God" moment.

124
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:28,458
It charges and mauls and devours.

125
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,958
Six months ago,
I was living on the street,

126
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:34,791
showing on the sidewalk.
So, that's where I'm coming from, right?

127
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,333
Let me fill you in.

128
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:41,000
All this... it's just a safari to hunt
the next new thing and eat it.

129
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,000
I heard you were the one to watch out for.

130
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:45,208
Oh, I'm easy-peasy.

131
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,666
Pussycat, really.

132
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:50,250
I know all about you,
going back to your punk days.

133
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,083
Oof, that was many moons ago.

134
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:55,208
- Velvet Buzzsaw.
- Yeah, well, the name was catchy.

135
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,916
Yeah, the early stuff was great.

136
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,208
Then it became, what? Like, self-parody?

137
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:00,916
I mean, after Polly left,

138
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,833
why'd you split up?

139
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,708
Who remembers through
all the booze and pills.

140
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,791
But the point is,

141
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:11,541
I've gone from anarchist
to purveyor of good taste.

142
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,750
So, I get the joke.

143
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,708
None of this is new.
It's all been done since

144
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,583
someone charged a bone
to see the first cave painting.

145
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:21,416
Here you are.

146
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,791
So... Thank you.

147
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,541
What cave are you showing in?

148
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,583
Me and my dudes started a collective.

149
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,853
Mmm. Well, cheers to that.

150
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:37,916
Well, hell knows, I love loyalty,

151
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,500
but I would kill to exhibit you.

152
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:45,000
I just turned down an offer
for a full show from Jon Dondon.

153
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,541
Ugh. And on and on.

154
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,958
He's inside right now
trying to poach Piers.

155
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,250
You know where I am, Damrish?

156
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,125
I'm here doing shots with you.

157
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,250
Club soda. Lime.

158
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,500
The market always tiers up for you, Piers.

159
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:04,416
Listen, my intolerance
for your bullshit is zero.

160
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,875
Lekker, no bullshit.

161
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,708
Look, Rhodora overpriced you.

162
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,791
She's lost it.
She's completely out of touch.

163
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,166
I sold Cranial today
for three point seven,

164
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,458
exactly what I said I'd get.

165
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:17,583
If you come with me,
our gallery has cutting-edge analytics

166
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:20,541
to maximize deal flow and global demand.

167
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,333
I am fighting to get back to creation,

168
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:27,708
to revelation, the billion years of energy
sparking through our brain.

169
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:30,958
I'm not jetting around,
hawking fucking tickets.

170
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,458
In an attention economy,
celebrity is art form.

171
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,916
Do you understand
that I only commission new work?

172
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,916
Repros, prints, replicas are all marketed
under my own brand.

173
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,583
My boet, I'm more than ecstatic to partner
you exclusively on your future work.

174
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:48,750
I hear Rhodora sold Sphere
for seven million.

175
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,833
Ugh. Man, it's a carnival attraction.

176
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,458
It's brilliant.

177
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,375
I never should've quit drinking.

178
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,333
Josephina.

179
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,750
Are you going to SLS?

180
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,708
I'm going to a satellite show
outside of town.

181
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Well, I'll come.

182
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,333
What's going on with you?

183
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:19,416
What do you mean?

184
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,250
You're Morf fucking Vandewalt.

185
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,333
What are you doing
coming to a grant show with me?

186
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,416
I like being with you.

187
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,666
We have a taste relationship.

188
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,958
Is that tobacco?

189
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:34,416
Hash oil.

190
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,375
Maybe I'll have one little puff.

191
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:53,500
Okay, that was the worst show
I've seen in years.

192
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:57,333
- And who was that angry guy when we left?
- You don't know?

193
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
That was Imeldus Vanderhorst.
You panned him last year.

194
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,583
Grab two Tito's from the fridge.

195
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,458
You know,
you're in much better shape than Ricky.

196
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:14,583
I... do a lot of Pilates and Peloton.

197
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,708
I remember your body.

198
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,000
I remember yours.

199
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:25,625
Ever since Berlin, I find myself
thinking all the time about you.

200
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:27,708
We were wasted.

201
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,666
I keep telling myself that.

202
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,541
Your skin.

203
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,750
It's the most beautiful cross
between almond and saddle brown.

204
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,875
I make you hard, huh?

205
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,166
You make me confused.

206
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,208
Tough headspace for a critic.

207
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:12,041
Got back to LA late last night
and looked at the numbers.

208
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,750
My God.

209
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,083
Aside from the peachy Minkins sale,

210
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:19,250
Miami was really
not a very great thriving market.

211
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,750
Brass tacks, we didn't move one Rubek.

212
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:26,541
I know the London office
has a hard-on for him, but to my mind,

213
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:31,458
the last thing we need to waste time on
is trying to flog some pop-art revival.

214
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,791
Pop-art.

215
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,875
Pop-art.

216
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,208
Fuck me.

217
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,625
Hey.

218
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:08,458
"Star of the Nova section
was Mertilla Splude's Go-Pro Kindergarten,

219
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:12,500
an inspired disquisition
of early-age experience."

220
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,708
Hmm.

221
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:19,125
Well, get inspired
and come join me in the pool.

222
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:24,708
Is he all right?

223
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:26,625
Call 911.

224
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,708
Who's supposed to be here?

225
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:45,833
Josephina. She's late... again.

226
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:50,166
You, Rococo.
Take the reception desk.

227
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:54,041
It's... It's Coco, actually. Um...

228
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,166
Haze Gallery. Can I help you?

229
00:15:58,625 --> 00:15:59,625
Hello?

230
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:06,833
Hang up, right?
Yeah, rich people are impatient.

231
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,791
I'm really an artist, you know?

232
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:16,291
I did, um, Bandini's Froot Loop Hippo,
you know that?

233
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,125
And I glued on all the Froot Loops.

234
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:20,875
Yeah.

235
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,500
It's at The Broad right now.

236
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,041
Not broad.
People confuse it with Broad.

237
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,625
- Broad, brode, yeah.
- Right.

238
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,666
But I can get us tickets if you want.

239
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,125
They know me there.

240
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,750
- When did you get back?
- Last night.

241
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,958
I have solid confirmation
Piers has left you for Jon Dondon.

242
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,125
I'm going to get bored now.

243
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,625
This feels huge to me.
Why would he leave?

244
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,708
Why, why why. Why anything?

245
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,666
Maybe I wanted him to leave.

246
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,541
Meanwhile, I'm signing new talent.

247
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,083
Heard you got Damrish. He's fierce.

248
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,625
And this morning, Mertilla Splude.

249
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:57,958
We are on the same frequency, I swear.

250
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:02,000
- Go-Pro Kindergarten's gonna break big.
- Your lips, God's ear.

251
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,333
Oh, wait. In our world, you are God.

252
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,416
And I'm running late. Gotta go.

253
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,583
Okay.

254
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,291
I'm sorry.

255
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,916
Some random guy just, like,
died in my building.

256
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,458
I really am so surprised.

257
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:20,916
Rhodora, I'm not kidding.

258
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,625
A neighbor actually died.
I found the body.

259
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:26,958
Bryson keeps me up to speed
on everything that goes on around here.

260
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,458
Your chronic lateness...

261
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:29,875
Bryson's pissed because...

262
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,833
he came on to me
and I shut him down.

263
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,375
He's a flat-out creeper.

264
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:38,000
Well, I can say the interest
I had in you has waned.

265
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,333
I thought I was grooming a protégé.

266
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:44,666
All our long talks about your struggles
and grand ambitions.

267
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:48,375
And then you insult my intelligent mind.
I'm moving you off the front.

268
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:52,458
No client contact until you raise
the quality bar in your performance.

269
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,958
- Morning.
- Good morning.

270
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:59,416
Do we have Berlin?
Singapore? London? Oh, we do.

271
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:03,458
So, I have two new favorite artists
I am all kinds of happy to tell you about.

272
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,541
I'm from Perlack.

273
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,958
We own the building.

274
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:37,916
Did you know him?

275
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,333
The guy who died?

276
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,000
Some sorta artist, I guess.

277
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,125
No.

278
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,791
I found his body.

279
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:48,750
He liked his privacy.

280
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,583
- He had a cat.
- It's up there. We'll find it tomorrow.

281
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,166
Jesus, the stuff inside...

282
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:58,208
And it all gets tossed.
The old man wanted everything thrown away.

283
00:18:58,458 --> 00:18:59,958
No trace, his instructions.

284
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,916
Looks like he started to do it himself,

285
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,833
but he died
before he could finish the job.

286
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,291
Well, good night.

287
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:50,958
Hey, kitty, kitty.

288
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,041
Hey, little guy.

289
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:53,875
Hey.

290
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,500
Hey.

291
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:24,833
Ah, so glad you called.

292
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:27,416
I'd hug, but I'm all sweaty.

293
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,500
Love the jumper.
Cornsilk's a great color for you.

294
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:33,208
Miami was a revelation.

295
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,583
Let me just start with that.

296
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:41,500
I don't know where I am with anything else
in my life, other than that I feel...

297
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:44,166
good with you.

298
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:48,333
So much better, and beyond good.

299
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:49,958
I found something.

300
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:52,083
That's what I'm saying.

301
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:27,583
Who did these?

302
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,083
What do you think of them?

303
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:33,875
They're visionary.

304
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,875
Mesmeric. An absolute incredible...

305
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,750
mix of mediums.

306
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,375
I'm ensorcelled.

307
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:54,708
- Do you think there's a market for it?
- Massive.

308
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:57,208
Beyond.

309
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:02,541
Who represents them?

310
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:06,041
I do.

311
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:10,750
I'm dying with suspense.

312
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:11,833
Who is it?

313
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:16,125
Tonight's jackpot is 400 million dollars.

314
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:19,916
To win that jackpot,
you must match these five white balls.

315
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:24,875
The first winning number tonight is 54.
That's followed by 32.

316
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:29,291
Up next we have 52.
Your next number is 34.

317
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:33,250
Your final white ball
for this Friday evening is 25.

318
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:35,416
If no one matches the five numbers...

319
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:38,875
It just seemed edgier at the Biennale.

320
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:43,166
Oh, is this the exact lighting?

321
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:44,541
I think so.

322
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,791
Okay, well, go check the specs.

323
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:08,375
I run the collective Damrish belongs to.

324
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:12,000
Oh. I didn't think
collectives had people in charge.

325
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:14,291
Doesn't that defeat the whole purpose?

326
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:16,250
I represent him.

327
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:17,333
Used to.

328
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:21,041
We're building something away
from all this commercial bullshit.

329
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:22,708
It's not just about the fucking money.

330
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:25,375
Stealing Damrish away would end us.

331
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:27,791
Okay. Well, you know what?
He's not a child.

332
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:29,291
It's his choice, not mine.

333
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:34,500
- You think this is done?
- Back the fuck up!

334
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:37,625
I tried to stop him.

335
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,416
Okay, well, you failed.

336
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,333
Unbelievable.

337
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:49,083
- It will... never happen again.
- Go!

338
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:06,958
Coco! Didn't you tell me
you wanted to get a cat?

339
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,500
Um...

340
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:10,541
can we talk about it later?

341
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:13,625
Sure.

342
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,250
Hey!

343
00:26:18,708 --> 00:26:21,541
- What the fuck do you think you're doing?
- What is this? Who is this?

344
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:22,541
That was under my desk.

345
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:25,250
I was looking for tape and I saw this.

346
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,708
- This is harassment.
- Tell me who the artist is.

347
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:31,458
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- I do more than maintenance and packing.

348
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I'm not just a man of primitive skills.

349
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,458
This shit... talks to me.

350
00:26:50,583 --> 00:26:52,750
Hey, you.
I heard you were coming by.

351
00:26:52,833 --> 00:26:54,541
I'm reviewing your Purlfoy exhibit.

352
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:57,041
Oh, be kind.
Our membership is plummeting.

353
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:01,708
Tell me something. Have you ever heard
of an artist named Vetril Dease?

354
00:27:01,791 --> 00:27:02,791
D-E-A-S-E.

355
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:05,000
No.

356
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:06,166
Can you check?

357
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:14,000
No. Not in our records,
and we have everyone.

358
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:19,000
Morf, honey, I, uh...

359
00:27:20,958 --> 00:27:23,125
- I need to bend your ear.
- Mmm?

360
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:28,291
I am leaving to become an art adviser.

361
00:27:28,375 --> 00:27:31,083
I know, I know.
I can't say for whom.

362
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:35,125
But I will be making enough to afford
a terribly lovely car and garden.

363
00:27:35,208 --> 00:27:36,708
Oh, hello, Morf.

364
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:38,166
Hello, Jim.

365
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,666
Look, I came to the museum

366
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,666
because I wanted to change
the world through art.

367
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,958
But the wealthy vacuum up everything,
except crumbs.

368
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:51,625
The best work is only enjoyed
by a tiny few.

369
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,458
And they buy what they're told.
So, why not join the party?

370
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:56,791
Mmm. It's everywhere, the money question.

371
00:27:57,458 --> 00:27:59,041
In advance of my move, I am...

372
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:02,666
actively looking for purchases
for my new client.

373
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:05,833
You might be interested to know

374
00:28:06,041 --> 00:28:09,000
that I can provide to you a generous,

375
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:13,333
untraceable reward for anything
you steer me to in the realm of

376
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:16,500
undervalued, pre-review, perhaps.

377
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:20,083
I don't do that.

378
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:23,750
What's your arrangement with Rhodora?

379
00:28:25,875 --> 00:28:26,875
None.

380
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:32,000
Then her buys prior to your favorable
reviews are utterly prescient?

381
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:33,083
This is my life.

382
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:37,083
How I connect with some sort
of spirituality at actual present.

383
00:28:37,166 --> 00:28:38,458
Mm-hmm, of course.

384
00:28:38,875 --> 00:28:40,625
I assess out of adoration.

385
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:43,041
I further the realm I analyze.

386
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:45,583
Forgive me, I...

387
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:47,083
Fuck.

388
00:28:50,291 --> 00:28:51,291
Kisses.

389
00:29:15,583 --> 00:29:17,625
Hey. What's going on?

390
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:19,791
You tell me.

391
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,250
What are you doing here?

392
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:30,083
Hell's bells.

393
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:32,041
Bryson.

394
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:36,333
- Incredible.
- I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

395
00:29:37,416 --> 00:29:39,625
Not if you had a gun.

396
00:29:39,708 --> 00:29:41,166
It's none of your business.

397
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,333
Oh, actually it is.

398
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:49,208
You signed a non-compete clause,
which, if you read, you might remember is

399
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:52,625
very much quite a lot broader than that.

400
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,000
Tell me all about Vetril Dease.

401
00:29:58,041 --> 00:30:01,500
Hmm.
His name is the tinsel on the tree.

402
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:06,541
Don't make me pull
some sort of heavy interrogation.

403
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Right now, it's just you and me,

404
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:14,000
with all our active friendship
and love for each other.

405
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:19,333
Now, how did you get all of these?

406
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:23,916
A guy upstairs. He died.

407
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,916
And you just took them?

408
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:28,583
He had no family or friends.

409
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,375
Well, I won't bother
with the obvious questions,

410
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:36,916
but, oh, you must have some giant plans.

411
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,666
I invented do-it-yourself.

412
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:43,541
And you're in way over your head, babe.

413
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:48,375
You have to archive and catalog
and establish ownership.

414
00:30:50,291 --> 00:30:51,583
And monetize.

415
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:58,041
I'm willing to do all of that
for... a reasonable percentage.

416
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:02,125
You can engage me
in an endless lawsuit, or...

417
00:31:02,833 --> 00:31:04,041
you can become rich

418
00:31:04,541 --> 00:31:06,541
and famous and successful.

419
00:31:07,291 --> 00:31:09,791
Which is what we both know
you've always wanted.

420
00:31:09,875 --> 00:31:10,875
Hmm?

421
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:28,267
We can claim the property was abandoned
if she says she found it in the dumpster.

422
00:31:28,291 --> 00:31:31,791
- And took steps to find a rightful owner.
- Well, first reports are he had no heirs.

423
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:34,195
She's just a tenant.
Could the building owner make a claim?

424
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:36,541
The salvage guy said
that they were junking everything.

425
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,166
I mean, it took hours to carry it all down
into my apartment.

426
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,416
There was just so much of it.

427
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,000
No, you found the art in the trash,
not in his apartment.

428
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:45,333
This is very important.

429
00:31:45,416 --> 00:31:49,000
Now, remembering back,
you found it in the dumpster.

430
00:31:49,083 --> 00:31:50,208
Isn't that what happened?

431
00:31:52,041 --> 00:31:53,041
The dumpster.

432
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:55,333
Yeah, I remember now.

433
00:32:10,541 --> 00:32:13,250
Critique is so limiting
and emotionally draining.

434
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:18,208
I've always wanted to do something
long-form, beyond opinion.

435
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:23,083
Dip my toe into an exploration
of origin and essence.

436
00:32:23,916 --> 00:32:26,625
A metamorphosis of spirit into reality.

437
00:32:28,625 --> 00:32:31,041
I've... I've never had the vehicle
until now.

438
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:34,583
An artist toiling in the recesses,

439
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:36,986
discovered in death.
I wanna start researching immediately.

440
00:32:37,041 --> 00:32:40,000
Well, there's timing. Meshing with
our extensive marketing plans,

441
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,323
which we haven't gotten to yet.

442
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:43,375
Well, I'm willing to write
the exhibit brochure.

443
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,300
That will give immediate weight
to the launch.

444
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:48,916
And in return,
I want exclusive rights to a book

445
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,708
and several pieces.

446
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:55,500
Well, that sounds swell.

447
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:14,416
Hi, Rhodora.

448
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:21,208
Well, I'm archiving his material,
then running spectrums on his paint.

449
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,541
And it's the damnedest thing.

450
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,833
I don't even know how to account for it.

451
00:33:28,541 --> 00:33:30,000
I couldn't hazard a guess.

452
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:34,083
Haze Gallery, please hold.

453
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:36,291
Haze Gallery, please hold.

454
00:33:36,791 --> 00:33:38,333
Haze Gallery, please hold.

455
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:42,416
Yes, Josephina's unavailable right now,
but I can take a message.

456
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,541
Okay, please hold.

457
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:46,166
Haze Gallery.

458
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:50,416
Uh, yes. Rhodora is aware of the meeting,
but she's on a call right now.

459
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:54,291
You're positive it's the same Dease?

460
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:56,416
- Yeah.
- Well, how can you be sure?

461
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,333
I visited the institution.
I found his records.

462
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:01,791
- Dear God.
- I wouldn't worry.

463
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:05,625
The file's so old, there's no backup.
I took the only copy.

464
00:34:05,708 --> 00:34:08,750
Okay, send it over.
And wash your hands of it.

465
00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:11,208
- And add a zero to your bill.
- Thanks.

466
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:21,791
Vetril Dease first appears
in a 1930 Los Angeles census,

467
00:34:22,375 --> 00:34:25,875
living in a low-income home with
his father, mother and younger sister.

468
00:34:27,416 --> 00:34:30,125
Nine years later,
Vetril is listed with his father

469
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:33,791
as the only survivors of a suspicious fire
which swept their house.

470
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:37,791
Shortly after the fire,
Vetril's named in a court document.

471
00:34:37,916 --> 00:34:40,416
Citing cruelty
beyond the bounds of humanity,

472
00:34:40,541 --> 00:34:43,750
child protection services remove Vetril
from his abusive father

473
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:47,333
and place him in the Good Templars
Orphanage in South Vallejo.

474
00:34:48,125 --> 00:34:50,125
His time there is a mystery,

475
00:34:50,791 --> 00:34:53,958
the only record being his departure at 18.

476
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,666
But the real mystery is what follows.

477
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:02,375
Dease disappears for three decades,
vanishing like a ghost.

478
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:07,083
He suddenly resurfaces on the payroll
of the Sawtelle veterans administration,

479
00:35:07,291 --> 00:35:10,916
where he was employed as a janitor
for 42 years.

480
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:14,375
Dease lived alone and isolated,

481
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:18,708
using his art to dive deep
into his own psyche.

482
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:22,958
The artist battled for decades
with his personal demons.

483
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:27,083
The result is an epic saga
of violence and madness.

484
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:31,250
A howl for answers
and a resolution that never comes.

485
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:39,291
My ex-boyfriend, Ricky,
has an exhibition Friday.

486
00:35:40,666 --> 00:35:42,250
He's a hack.

487
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:45,416
A bearded, downtown poser.

488
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:53,583
You know, he hasn't had, like,
an original idea in his whole life.

489
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:58,416
On top of which, he steals from everyone.

490
00:35:58,708 --> 00:36:00,125
But you know that, right?

491
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:02,541
I'm very familiar with his work.

492
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:08,041
You should go to his show,

493
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:12,666
see for yourself how much he sucks.

494
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:16,958
- Then do what you do.
- Are you serious?

495
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:19,541
For me.

496
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,250
Hello, Morf.

497
00:36:34,916 --> 00:36:35,750
Right.

498
00:36:35,833 --> 00:36:36,833
Is it contemporary?

499
00:36:36,916 --> 00:36:39,583
It cuts through the bullshit
and gives form to true emotion.

500
00:36:39,708 --> 00:36:42,041
- What does it say?
- What do you feel?

501
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:45,125
They're using tech in a whole new way.

502
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,833
The idea is aiming for a platform
that includes all media.

503
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:50,791
Everything's interruptive now.

504
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:53,500
He came from nowhere, knew no one,

505
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:57,125
and if our industrious Josephina here
hadn't been so observant,

506
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,583
his genius work would've been thrown away.

507
00:36:59,916 --> 00:37:03,708
And, um, he would've been
consigned to oblivion.

508
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:08,083
I spotted it by a streetlight
over a dumpster.

509
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:10,666
Approximately,
how many pieces are there?

510
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:12,250
Well, unfortunately,

511
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:16,583
Mr. Dease's output was the opposite
from what one would call prolific.

512
00:37:17,041 --> 00:37:18,833
And he's certainly not making any more.

513
00:37:18,958 --> 00:37:21,708
There's one we're very interested in.

514
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:24,166
Well, just know demand
has people ready to kill.

515
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:26,041
Ya!

516
00:37:26,666 --> 00:37:27,500
Fetchin'.

517
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:29,750
Before the sublime,
the whole body quivers.

518
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:32,666
Mm-hmm. Well, at these prices,
your museum's locked out.

519
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,833
Well, I just yesterday left the museum,
so I can speak freely now.

520
00:37:36,041 --> 00:37:38,625
- I'm an adviser for a private buyer.
- Whom?

521
00:37:38,916 --> 00:37:40,666
Our friend who bought Sphere.

522
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,916
Well, how hilarious for you.

523
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,041
In that capacity,

524
00:37:44,125 --> 00:37:47,000
I do have my eye on several
of the large-format product for him.

525
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:50,333
Mmm. Well, the sales staff
have been busy beavers.

526
00:37:50,541 --> 00:37:51,958
Everything's on reserve.

527
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:53,833
Perhaps we'd pay a premium.

528
00:37:54,083 --> 00:37:56,666
- That doesn't butter the biscuit.
- Well, what the fuck would?

529
00:37:57,416 --> 00:37:58,916
I'll sell you two Dease

530
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,833
if you buy three pieces
at Damrish's opening next month.

531
00:38:01,916 --> 00:38:04,291
What if my client
doesn't respond to Damrish?

532
00:38:04,375 --> 00:38:06,916
Well, you're the adviser. Advise.

533
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:09,166
Hey.

534
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:48,208
Damn.

535
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:56,083
Next month, it's your show.

536
00:38:56,666 --> 00:38:58,333
I gotta... I gotta go.

537
00:38:58,416 --> 00:38:59,416
Okay.

538
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:28,583
Isn't it exhilarating
to see something substantial?

539
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:31,583
I mean, other than celebrity
tattoo artists and

540
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,541
balloons for painting tools.
I'm writing a book about him.

541
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:38,416
I just loathed your Ricky Blane
review yesterday.

542
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,125
I thought his show was inspired.

543
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:43,333
Well, I didn't get it, I suppose.

544
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:45,708
I felt that we saw
totally different exhibits.

545
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:50,750
Mmm. A bad review is better than
sinking into the great glut of anonymity.

546
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:53,166
Was that a joke?

547
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:55,750
Not that I'm aware of.

548
00:39:57,083 --> 00:40:00,041
Ricky got drunk
and crashed his car last night.

549
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:01,458
He's in coma.

550
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:02,916
I heard he was crushed.

551
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
By the car?

552
00:40:05,666 --> 00:40:07,833
Your review. Arschloch.

553
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:20,875
What do you mean, Bryson's
moving some of the art to storage?

554
00:40:20,958 --> 00:40:23,083
Well, if De Beers released
all their diamonds,

555
00:40:23,166 --> 00:40:24,583
they'd be cheap as cut glass.

556
00:40:24,833 --> 00:40:26,875
Didn't they teach
any of this in art school?

557
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:28,708
How many are we saying he made?

558
00:40:28,958 --> 00:40:32,875
Well, their value's their scarcity,
so it's not what we say. It's the reality.

559
00:40:32,958 --> 00:40:35,916
The reality is we have over
one thousand pieces stored upstairs.

560
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:37,750
Well, that's nonsense.

561
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:40,083
Why, I doubt if it's even
half that number.

562
00:40:40,166 --> 00:40:41,583
What have you done?

563
00:40:41,666 --> 00:40:45,750
Removed them from circulation.
Locking them away for a rainy day.

564
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:36,375
Fuck.

565
00:42:36,875 --> 00:42:37,916
Fuck! Fuck!

566
00:42:38,666 --> 00:42:40,458
Fuck!

567
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:23,666
Oh! Shit. Shit!

568
00:43:33,583 --> 00:43:34,916
Oh, shit.

569
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,500
Hello?

570
00:44:59,125 --> 00:45:00,291
Howzit? It's Dondon.

571
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:13,750
Easy, boy. Not yet.

572
00:45:16,458 --> 00:45:18,458
Studio visit. I'm excited.

573
00:45:19,791 --> 00:45:22,458
I can't stomach cheery or upbeat.

574
00:45:22,541 --> 00:45:24,541
I'm not an idiot. Remember that.

575
00:45:24,625 --> 00:45:26,392
Hey, I'm honored
to be your new representative

576
00:45:26,416 --> 00:45:27,601
and see what you've been up to.

577
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:28,750
I just bet you are.

578
00:45:28,833 --> 00:45:31,250
So, this is where the magic happens?

579
00:45:32,166 --> 00:45:33,291
Is that a joke?

580
00:45:34,416 --> 00:45:35,416
Sorry?

581
00:45:36,416 --> 00:45:39,125
This is repros and replicas.

582
00:45:39,458 --> 00:45:41,041
Studio's upstairs.

583
00:45:41,416 --> 00:45:42,833
Rupert, up.

584
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:02,791
This is remarkable.

585
00:46:04,541 --> 00:46:05,541
It's not art.

586
00:46:31,291 --> 00:46:32,291
Well?

587
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,208
Well, I...

588
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,708
I'm just soaking it in.
It's thrilling to see a work in progress.

589
00:46:39,041 --> 00:46:42,875
Just give me an honest goddamn opinion
about what you're looking at.

590
00:46:44,458 --> 00:46:47,166
I can see a line
with your body of work. So...

591
00:46:47,666 --> 00:46:49,416
So, I'm copying myself?

592
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,416
It's not copying if it's your canon.

593
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,458
I thought your studio was downtown.

594
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:58,208
Too many addiction triggers.

595
00:46:59,041 --> 00:47:01,958
- I worked here the last year.
- Well, I...

596
00:47:02,041 --> 00:47:04,375
I'd love to see all the new work
you've done since moving,

597
00:47:04,458 --> 00:47:07,708
because the team is geared up and ready
to sell every new piece you have.

598
00:47:21,958 --> 00:47:23,916
Right.

599
00:47:26,291 --> 00:47:27,375
Sure, of course.

600
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,666
No, you've... you've been gestating.

601
00:47:32,708 --> 00:47:34,708
Gestation implies birth.

602
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:38,833
Ideas come, but they kill themselves
as soon as they appear.

603
00:47:40,083 --> 00:47:41,541
This is a slaughterhouse.

604
00:47:42,666 --> 00:47:43,958
Welcome aboard.

605
00:47:53,375 --> 00:47:56,583
When we got the call,
it took us a few days to locate you.

606
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,375
We've been busy.

607
00:47:58,791 --> 00:48:01,458
Now, it looks he slid
into the side of a gas station

608
00:48:01,541 --> 00:48:03,666
out in Angeles National Forest.

609
00:48:04,041 --> 00:48:05,791
Place has been closed for years.

610
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:09,250
What caused the crash?

611
00:48:09,791 --> 00:48:10,791
Don't know.

612
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,625
Think he may have hit his head
and wandered off.

613
00:48:15,208 --> 00:48:16,708
It's easy to get lost out there.

614
00:48:18,291 --> 00:48:19,541
Was anything recovered?

615
00:48:19,625 --> 00:48:21,250
Well, we put it in the back here.

616
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:24,750
We think the vehicle may have been
vandalized before we located it.

617
00:48:25,291 --> 00:48:27,000
There's a big homeless camp near there.

618
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:29,248
They would've cleaned it out
if they found it first.

619
00:48:29,791 --> 00:48:31,958
Was there anything of value
you know was inside?

620
00:48:33,083 --> 00:48:34,083
No.

621
00:48:34,791 --> 00:48:35,958
Not that I know of.

622
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:38,500
This is all you found?

623
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:40,541
Uh, no.

624
00:48:41,166 --> 00:48:42,166
There was this.

625
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,125
Where did he go?

626
00:48:47,833 --> 00:48:49,000
Where's the art?

627
00:48:49,291 --> 00:48:50,971
Why would you trust him
in the first place?

628
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,750
I didn't tell him what was in the crates.

629
00:48:52,875 --> 00:48:56,375
All he had to do was deliver them
to a warehouse in Lancaster.

630
00:48:56,458 --> 00:48:58,708
This shit goes sideways,
and I'm telling you straight up,

631
00:48:58,791 --> 00:49:01,958
I will say this was all your idea.
I had nothing to do with it.

632
00:49:07,291 --> 00:49:09,666
This is Bryson's phone.
Obviously, I didn't pick up.

633
00:49:10,708 --> 00:49:13,083
Bryson, it's me.

634
00:49:14,041 --> 00:49:15,625
Where the fuck are you?

635
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:20,041
You trying to strong-arm me,
cash in on your own? What?

636
00:49:24,208 --> 00:49:26,208
Don't fuck with me, Bryson. Call me.

637
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:31,166
I came at the right time.

638
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:33,208
No, no. Not now.

639
00:49:33,291 --> 00:49:34,291
I have a lot to do.

640
00:49:35,083 --> 00:49:38,958
- Wha... It's not for three hours.
- It'll take me that long to get ready.

641
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:40,708
It's just a fundraiser.

642
00:49:41,666 --> 00:49:43,125
There's going to be pictures.

643
00:49:43,625 --> 00:49:46,333
Our first time out.
This is super important to me.

644
00:49:46,916 --> 00:49:48,000
I wanna look good.

645
00:49:48,541 --> 00:49:50,250
Mmm, I found a sick dress.

646
00:49:51,375 --> 00:49:54,000
This sofa's completely too small
for the ceiling height.

647
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,625
It swims in here.

648
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:02,875
So, I've been cataloging
paintings for the book.

649
00:50:04,666 --> 00:50:06,000
Something doesn't add up.

650
00:50:06,833 --> 00:50:07,833
What's that?

651
00:50:09,458 --> 00:50:12,583
There's almost no studies or sketches.
They seem to be missing.

652
00:50:13,666 --> 00:50:16,666
As well as large gaps
from different periods of his work.

653
00:50:19,833 --> 00:50:21,125
He dated them, you know.

654
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
No, everything I found is there.

655
00:50:24,291 --> 00:50:25,875
Trust me, I'd know.

656
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:29,875
Hey, I've got some
great champagne in the fridge.

657
00:50:29,958 --> 00:50:31,375
Open it while we get ready.

658
00:50:48,541 --> 00:50:51,416
Stop by before you leave.

659
00:50:52,208 --> 00:50:55,208
Your three o'clock is here.
Interview for the archivist opening.

660
00:50:58,250 --> 00:50:59,250
You're too young.

661
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:02,750
Uh...

662
00:51:03,458 --> 00:51:04,958
I'm twenty-two.

663
00:51:05,416 --> 00:51:08,041
The position requires someone
with years of experience.

664
00:51:08,291 --> 00:51:09,916
Stop back when you're forty, eh?

665
00:51:11,333 --> 00:51:12,333
That's it?

666
00:51:12,625 --> 00:51:14,041
That is it.

667
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:22,916
You worked for Rhodora?

668
00:51:27,666 --> 00:51:29,208
Just for a few weeks.

669
00:51:29,291 --> 00:51:31,750
So, the non-compete clause doesn't apply.

670
00:51:32,208 --> 00:51:34,375
- She fired you?
- I was on a break.

671
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:37,041
A man walked in and talked to her,
and she never let it go.

672
00:51:37,125 --> 00:51:38,666
You were there for the Dease opening?

673
00:51:40,125 --> 00:51:42,416
- It was a zoo.
- You know how much she generated?

674
00:51:43,458 --> 00:51:45,125
- I saw the numbers.
- The buyers list?

675
00:51:46,416 --> 00:51:47,416
Every name.

676
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,416
Your client bought two.

677
00:51:51,083 --> 00:51:52,125
Very resourceful.

678
00:51:53,916 --> 00:51:56,125
I've learned that you have to be.

679
00:51:59,333 --> 00:52:04,500
Rhodora had, um, a file on Dease
that she kept locked away.

680
00:52:05,875 --> 00:52:08,000
One day I found the key and...

681
00:52:09,166 --> 00:52:11,583
it was a very interesting read.

682
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:14,750
You know what? I might have an opening.

683
00:52:16,291 --> 00:52:18,583
Come back to my office
and tell me what else you heard.

684
00:52:32,875 --> 00:52:36,625
Ah, I do miss it here.

685
00:52:36,708 --> 00:52:40,541
The camaraderie, the purity of purpose,

686
00:52:41,083 --> 00:52:44,833
the Tuesday meatloaf
as the cafe overlooking the tar pits.

687
00:52:44,916 --> 00:52:48,666
Well, on to Vetril Dease.

688
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:52,250
In the united federation of the universe,

689
00:52:52,333 --> 00:52:55,875
I doubt there is a hotter artist
at the moment.

690
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,208
Do you know, since the exhibit opening,
he's actually trending on Twitter.

691
00:52:59,291 --> 00:53:00,916
We're interested in showing him.

692
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,875
How many pieces are we talking about?

693
00:53:02,958 --> 00:53:05,416
I can supply two owned by my client.

694
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:08,125
And another ten on loan
from the Haze Gallery.

695
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,250
Send dimensions and JPEGs for the group,
and we'll aim for a spot next season.

696
00:53:15,291 --> 00:53:17,208
I want them exhibited ASAP.

697
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:19,541
Main hall, new wing.

698
00:53:20,125 --> 00:53:22,500
- Event marketing.
- You know we have a process, Gretchen.

699
00:53:22,583 --> 00:53:27,500
Ooh! I had a glorious concept
to support my former employer,

700
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:30,875
and supposed premier
contemporary art museum of Los Angeles,

701
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:33,166
with a first showing of a Dease!

702
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:35,500
We appreciate the significance,

703
00:53:35,583 --> 00:53:37,333
but there is the issue of space.

704
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:41,500
Well, move Banyo's Horse Penis
or the Jeweled Vagina.

705
00:53:41,583 --> 00:53:43,791
Put one inside the other for all I care.

706
00:53:43,875 --> 00:53:47,125
There is a tax issue, and my client
wants his Dease exhibited immediately.

707
00:53:47,208 --> 00:53:51,000
Now, in return for my very generous offer,

708
00:53:51,375 --> 00:53:54,041
I also want Minkins' Sphere to be shown.

709
00:53:54,125 --> 00:53:56,041
Oh, come on, Gretchen,
this isn't a rug bazaar.

710
00:53:56,125 --> 00:53:58,416
No, it's an equation
with a solution at the end.

711
00:53:59,041 --> 00:54:00,250
And if you can't grasp that,

712
00:54:00,333 --> 00:54:03,458
there are other museums,
I assure you, that will.

713
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Ah.

714
00:54:09,083 --> 00:54:10,083
Kisses.

715
00:55:03,458 --> 00:55:04,458
Oh!

716
00:55:06,458 --> 00:55:08,041
Sorry.

717
00:55:09,083 --> 00:55:10,291
I didn't see you there.

718
00:55:13,291 --> 00:55:15,625
Hi. I'm Morf Vandewalt.

719
00:55:15,708 --> 00:55:18,375
I'm here researching Vetril Dease.

720
00:55:18,958 --> 00:55:22,625
- I'm... writing a book about him.
- What for?

721
00:55:26,291 --> 00:55:30,625
He's... He's become a prominent artist
in... in the outsider school.

722
00:55:30,916 --> 00:55:32,666
Did... Did you work with him?

723
00:55:34,041 --> 00:55:35,083
Eighteen years.

724
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,555
Well, it would be extremely helpful

725
00:55:38,583 --> 00:55:40,303
if we could arrange a time
to talk in depth.

726
00:55:40,375 --> 00:55:43,875
You see, I have so many questions,
and there's so few people who knew him.

727
00:55:45,666 --> 00:55:47,333
There was a vet you could've talked to.

728
00:55:48,583 --> 00:55:50,958
He had a few medals and a loud mouth.

729
00:55:51,041 --> 00:55:54,625
Liked to ride people,
particularly Dease.

730
00:55:55,458 --> 00:55:58,000
He wound up dead in a field.

731
00:55:58,583 --> 00:55:59,791
Hands tied.

732
00:56:00,916 --> 00:56:02,416
Never found who did it.

733
00:56:05,833 --> 00:56:07,541
So, you're saying it was Dease?

734
00:56:08,041 --> 00:56:10,000
- Damn it!
- Oh! Jesus.

735
00:56:12,791 --> 00:56:15,166
I'm saying you left him the fuck alone.

736
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:19,083
Look, I have nothing more to say.

737
00:56:19,166 --> 00:56:21,291
And you can tell
that other damn fella that, too.

738
00:56:21,541 --> 00:56:22,583
Who?

739
00:56:23,208 --> 00:56:24,833
The one who came by here yesterday.

740
00:56:25,375 --> 00:56:26,916
I don't know who that would be.

741
00:56:29,458 --> 00:56:30,458
Here.

742
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:40,416
Well, we've corroborated
Dease's twenty-year incarceration,

743
00:56:40,541 --> 00:56:43,083
using court documents, police records,

744
00:56:43,625 --> 00:56:44,833
and work history.

745
00:56:45,791 --> 00:56:48,750
Dease left
the Good Templars Orphanage at 18.

746
00:56:49,666 --> 00:56:52,541
He was drafted.
Served two years in the army.

747
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:54,416
And when he got out,

748
00:56:54,875 --> 00:56:56,875
he suffered some sort of a breakdown.

749
00:56:58,166 --> 00:56:59,166
At that point,

750
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:02,875
he tracked down his abusive father
and murdered him.

751
00:57:03,541 --> 00:57:05,083
He didn't kill him right away, though.

752
00:57:06,333 --> 00:57:07,875
He dragged it out for days,

753
00:57:07,958 --> 00:57:10,750
torturing him, then burning him alive.

754
00:57:11,875 --> 00:57:15,958
Dease spent two decades in a psychiatric
hospital for the criminally insane.

755
00:57:16,625 --> 00:57:19,458
The facility used inmates
for medical experiments.

756
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:22,250
Injections, shocks.

757
00:57:22,333 --> 00:57:23,666
God knows what else.

758
00:57:26,083 --> 00:57:27,541
They were human guinea pigs.

759
00:57:27,833 --> 00:57:29,833
Dease got released
when the courts closed it.

760
00:57:30,041 --> 00:57:31,041
From there he goes to LA

761
00:57:31,375 --> 00:57:34,208
and got a job at the veterans home
and lived off the grid.

762
00:57:35,125 --> 00:57:38,333
No bank account, car, license.

763
00:57:39,041 --> 00:57:40,541
Couldn't even find a usable photo.

764
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:44,166
And you verified all this?
You're sure?

765
00:57:44,916 --> 00:57:45,958
It all checked out.

766
00:57:46,458 --> 00:57:47,458
Those are the facts.

767
00:57:48,083 --> 00:57:50,541
All right, I'm gonna release this
tomorrow. I'm gonna need you

768
00:57:50,625 --> 00:57:53,000
to speak to the press,
attesting to your credentials,

769
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:54,916
the authenticity
of what's in the file, and...

770
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,541
and the atrocious and disturbing nature
of what you found, et cetera, et cetera.

771
00:58:01,291 --> 00:58:04,250
I thought this kind of stuff
would raise the value of his work.

772
00:58:04,333 --> 00:58:05,458
Oh, no, no.

773
00:58:06,125 --> 00:58:07,375
This is another level.

774
00:58:08,625 --> 00:58:10,791
- Have a good night.
- Nighty-night.

775
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,041
You've reached Morf. Leave a message.

776
00:58:25,791 --> 00:58:27,250
Howzit, Morf? It's Jon.

777
00:58:27,333 --> 00:58:30,213
Give me a call back as soon as you can.
I have something regarding Dease.

778
00:58:30,291 --> 00:58:31,875
I think might interest you greatly.

779
00:58:52,416 --> 00:58:53,416
Hello?

780
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,541
Hello?

781
01:00:11,166 --> 01:00:12,416
What the hell?

782
01:01:39,458 --> 01:01:40,458
Jon?

783
01:02:06,833 --> 01:02:07,833
Jon?

784
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:23,875
Oh, we are just stuck in here,
aren't we?

785
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:28,166
What is with that cheesy organ music?

786
01:02:36,041 --> 01:02:37,875
And that casket. What color is that?

787
01:02:37,958 --> 01:02:40,750
Smog orange? Did he buy it on sale?

788
01:02:40,833 --> 01:02:42,375
Not so loud.

789
01:02:43,416 --> 01:02:47,166
Seriously, imagine having to spend
an eternity in that.

790
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:50,000
Jesus.
Nothing is ever good enough for you.

791
01:02:51,625 --> 01:02:53,541
Well, it's my job. I'm selective.

792
01:02:54,958 --> 01:02:56,250
What are you even saying?

793
01:02:56,916 --> 01:02:58,375
Toss out taste and standards?

794
01:02:58,708 --> 01:02:59,958
Whisper the truth?

795
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:03,083
What a tragic world that would be.

796
01:03:04,791 --> 01:03:05,958
Oh, hi.

797
01:03:07,166 --> 01:03:08,166
I'm Josephina.

798
01:03:09,041 --> 01:03:11,500
I work with Rhodora.
I'm a partner at the gallery.

799
01:03:11,583 --> 01:03:15,000
- Oh, yeah. Damrish.
- Oh, of course.

800
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:18,833
- I am just such a huge fan your work.
- Thank you.

801
01:03:19,041 --> 01:03:20,708
I do the Dease collection.

802
01:03:22,291 --> 01:03:23,625
It's otherworldly.

803
01:03:24,208 --> 01:03:26,541
- Thank you.
- Your review of Hoboman killed the sale.

804
01:03:26,666 --> 01:03:29,416
Instead of being seen,
it's gathering dust at a storage facility.

805
01:03:29,958 --> 01:03:31,708
I am not your mouthpiece.

806
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
God.

807
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:47,333
We competed for everything,

808
01:03:48,208 --> 01:03:51,208
but I absolutely despise
being here for this.

809
01:03:52,333 --> 01:03:55,125
I mean, what was he facing,
to do something like that?

810
01:03:56,583 --> 01:04:00,166
He was his usual shallow self
the last time we spoke.

811
01:04:03,125 --> 01:04:04,708
Started drinking again.

812
01:04:04,791 --> 01:04:06,291
Ooh, happy days.

813
01:04:07,375 --> 01:04:11,458
Um, this here
is for family and friends only.

814
01:04:11,958 --> 01:04:12,958
Mmm.

815
01:04:13,333 --> 01:04:16,041
Well, Jon started at my gallery, so...

816
01:04:16,375 --> 01:04:18,625
I mean, where the hell else would I sit?

817
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:23,541
Ladies and gentleman, if we may begin.

818
01:04:26,833 --> 01:04:29,958
- Did you take a Viagra or something?
- I'm almost there.

819
01:04:31,625 --> 01:04:33,708
No. I'm going on my back.

820
01:04:33,875 --> 01:04:36,375
- No.
- I can't stay like this.

821
01:04:39,666 --> 01:04:43,375
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

822
01:04:44,083 --> 01:04:45,083
Open your eyes.

823
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:51,583
I'm down here.

824
01:04:55,583 --> 01:04:57,250
Oh, God damn it.

825
01:04:59,125 --> 01:05:00,166
Something's wrong.

826
01:05:00,625 --> 01:05:03,458
We've got a fucking problem. Literally.

827
01:05:03,541 --> 01:05:05,458
I'm seeing things, um...

828
01:05:06,666 --> 01:05:07,833
Things moving.

829
01:05:09,083 --> 01:05:11,083
Seriously, I'm really scared.

830
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:13,041
I was turned on by your passion,

831
01:05:13,125 --> 01:05:14,958
from listening to your intelligent mind,

832
01:05:15,041 --> 01:05:17,083
and now you've turned into
I don't know what.

833
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,333
Your reviews have fallen off,

834
01:05:23,166 --> 01:05:25,166
and you still have feelings for Ed,
admit it.

835
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:26,916
I do not have feelings for Ed.

836
01:05:27,291 --> 01:05:30,625
Gretchen ran into him, and he said that
you two were talking and working it out.

837
01:05:30,708 --> 01:05:32,166
Well, Ed is a big liar,

838
01:05:32,416 --> 01:05:33,750
and Gretchen is a bitch!

839
01:05:33,833 --> 01:05:37,541
- I checked your phone. You made six calls.
- He was moving out, we were coordinating.

840
01:05:37,625 --> 01:05:39,458
What do you mean,
my reviews have fallen off?

841
01:05:40,208 --> 01:05:41,500
You're right.

842
01:05:41,583 --> 01:05:43,666
Your edge. Makes sense.

843
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:46,750
You don't know what you like
or even want.

844
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:48,833
I'll tell you what I did like.

845
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:50,916
Ricky Blane's show.

846
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,041
But you jammed me to crush him!

847
01:05:53,625 --> 01:05:55,083
Don't lay that on me.

848
01:05:55,291 --> 01:05:58,166
Like he was your first bad review.
Gimme a break.

849
01:05:59,875 --> 01:06:01,500
I'm not saying that I blame you.

850
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:03,875
I'm saying that I regret it.

851
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:07,583
Hey, uh...

852
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:13,000
I think that I've been staring too long

853
01:06:13,083 --> 01:06:16,083
at all this Dease art
and all his material.

854
01:06:17,041 --> 01:06:20,250
I'm... I'm gonna get my vision checked.
This will pass.

855
01:06:20,875 --> 01:06:22,333
Hey.

856
01:06:24,208 --> 01:06:26,250
Listen to my intelligent mind.

857
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:37,500
Well?

858
01:06:37,583 --> 01:06:39,000
I'm not pickled.

859
01:06:40,583 --> 01:06:43,458
It's a small step, I suppose,
toward something, but

860
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,041
let's talk turkey.

861
01:06:45,666 --> 01:06:47,416
What are you afraid of?

862
01:06:48,833 --> 01:06:51,041
We go way, way back.

863
01:06:53,625 --> 01:06:55,958
I wanna share with you
a little somethin' somethin'.

864
01:07:05,708 --> 01:07:08,291
"Dependency murders creativity.

865
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:11,833
Creativity plays with the unknown.

866
01:07:12,791 --> 01:07:17,791
No strategies exist
that can enclose the endless realm

867
01:07:18,458 --> 01:07:19,458
of the new.

868
01:07:20,083 --> 01:07:22,208
Only trust in yourself

869
01:07:22,291 --> 01:07:24,583
can carry you past your fears

870
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:27,000
and the already known."

871
01:07:28,708 --> 01:07:32,083
That's Polly Anna, 1983.

872
01:07:32,666 --> 01:07:35,541
I found it clearing out her apartment
after she OD'd.

873
01:07:37,666 --> 01:07:40,416
I gave up being an artist a long time ago,

874
01:07:40,958 --> 01:07:42,541
but I know how this works.

875
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:44,625
Forget about the art world.

876
01:07:44,708 --> 01:07:47,750
You need to get away from here,
from all this. Take a break.

877
01:07:47,833 --> 01:07:50,500
Use my beach house and stay there

878
01:07:50,583 --> 01:07:53,333
until you do something
for nobody but yourself.

879
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:01,041
Which one's better? One.

880
01:08:01,958 --> 01:08:03,041
- Two.
- Two.

881
01:08:03,125 --> 01:08:06,000
All right. Two.
One. Better, worse, no different?

882
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:08,916
No different.

883
01:08:09,666 --> 01:08:11,208
All right. There we go.

884
01:08:14,458 --> 01:08:15,833
All right. Well,

885
01:08:16,916 --> 01:08:20,458
your acuity has actually improved
since your last prescription.

886
01:08:20,958 --> 01:08:24,000
I was hoping you'd find something
to explain what's happening.

887
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:26,125
Mmm. The phantom movements?

888
01:08:26,625 --> 01:08:28,500
I think I have Charles Bonnet syndrome.

889
01:08:28,583 --> 01:08:30,958
Hallucinations, visions, moving objects.

890
01:08:31,041 --> 01:08:32,875
You've been on the Internet. Yeah.

891
01:08:33,041 --> 01:08:35,791
It's highly doubtful
in the absence of other factors.

892
01:08:35,875 --> 01:08:39,416
But let's make another appointment
for this week.

893
01:08:40,083 --> 01:08:43,583
I dilated your eyes,
so you have to wear these for a few hours.

894
01:08:47,125 --> 01:08:48,458
These are heinous.

895
01:08:59,250 --> 01:09:00,250
Shit.

896
01:09:02,541 --> 01:09:04,541
Fuck.

897
01:09:06,291 --> 01:09:07,625
Yes, who is this?

898
01:09:07,708 --> 01:09:10,416
- It's me.
- Oh, how clever. You blocked your number.

899
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:12,291
'Cause you won't answer my calls.

900
01:09:12,375 --> 01:09:15,791
Well, after your vile voice message
yesterday, are you surprised?

901
01:09:15,875 --> 01:09:17,583
Wha... I...

902
01:09:19,041 --> 01:09:21,791
Telling Josephina I am still with Ed?

903
01:09:21,875 --> 01:09:24,708
- Oh! That's my crime?
- We broke up.

904
01:09:24,791 --> 01:09:27,291
I was coordinating with him moving out.

905
01:09:27,833 --> 01:09:30,125
Honestly, I expected an apology.

906
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:33,958
Ed said precisely there was more to it
than that. I merely passed it on.

907
01:09:35,541 --> 01:09:37,166
You're a joke!

908
01:09:37,875 --> 01:09:40,791
You have no credibility in any way!

909
01:09:40,875 --> 01:09:43,833
Oh, really? Well, in that case,
I suppose there's no truth whatsoever

910
01:09:43,916 --> 01:09:47,250
in your little friend Josephina
sniffing around Damrish, who, might I add,

911
01:09:47,333 --> 01:09:50,291
are literally about to drive off
into the sunset together.

912
01:10:06,833 --> 01:10:07,833
Gita?

913
01:10:09,041 --> 01:10:11,083
- Yes.
- Hi.

914
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:13,416
- I'm Morf Vande...
- Vandewalt.

915
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,875
- Yes.
- Of course. I've read you for years.

916
01:10:15,958 --> 01:10:17,125
Yes.

917
01:10:17,791 --> 01:10:20,333
Are those the new Persols?

918
01:10:21,458 --> 01:10:23,125
Yeah. That's right.

919
01:10:24,041 --> 01:10:25,041
Mmm.

920
01:10:25,833 --> 01:10:27,083
That's a Freud.

921
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:30,000
- Yes, it is.
- I've never seen that one before.

922
01:10:30,166 --> 01:10:32,500
It's been in a crate since '92.

923
01:10:32,833 --> 01:10:34,250
And it's going back in one.

924
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:39,375
I loved your exhibit brochure
on Dease, by the way.

925
01:10:40,208 --> 01:10:41,208
Thank you.

926
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,875
As I said on the phone,
I'm expanding it into a book.

927
01:10:45,375 --> 01:10:47,125
Well, there's enough there for one.

928
01:10:48,541 --> 01:10:51,166
You cataloged the collection presale.

929
01:10:51,458 --> 01:10:52,583
Oh, not cataloged.

930
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:56,958
My primary focus became
Dease's distinctive methodology.

931
01:10:57,625 --> 01:11:02,166
I spent three weeks identifying
conventions, workflow, classifications.

932
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:06,083
It was almost impossible to delineate
between working materials and

933
01:11:06,791 --> 01:11:08,208
personal effects.

934
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,333
Frankly, I was glad to finish.

935
01:11:12,541 --> 01:11:13,541
Hmm.

936
01:11:15,458 --> 01:11:17,500
Well, I wasn't aware
there were any personal effects

937
01:11:17,583 --> 01:11:19,125
besides the ones in my possession.

938
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:22,333
None in a traditional sense.

939
01:11:22,416 --> 01:11:24,291
I mean, as in tissue.

940
01:11:28,458 --> 01:11:29,458
Paper?

941
01:11:30,791 --> 01:11:32,958
Perhaps you should speak with Rhodora.

942
01:11:33,625 --> 01:11:34,958
Rhodora is...

943
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:37,125
backing the book.

944
01:11:37,458 --> 01:11:41,416
I have her full support
and confidence, of course.

945
01:11:48,166 --> 01:11:49,958
Tissue as in blood serum.

946
01:11:50,833 --> 01:11:52,791
The artist's, I assume.

947
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:56,333
He used it to create
the reddish blacks and the shadows.

948
01:11:57,791 --> 01:11:59,458
It was in every piece we studied.

949
01:12:02,625 --> 01:12:05,583
That is an outrageous request.
Even coming from you.

950
01:12:05,666 --> 01:12:08,083
I don't get your pushback on a Minkins

951
01:12:08,166 --> 01:12:11,583
retrospective here, in the fall,
of all his major works.

952
01:12:11,666 --> 01:12:13,375
We already agreed to put up Sphere

953
01:12:13,458 --> 01:12:15,375
in exchange for you
bringing us twelve Dease.

954
01:12:15,458 --> 01:12:19,000
Seriously, Gretchen, it's rude and dumb.
If you wanted to ram more

955
01:12:19,083 --> 01:12:21,958
of your collector's hoard down our throats
to increase their value,

956
01:12:22,041 --> 01:12:24,267
you should have done so
before the Dease deal was locked,

957
01:12:24,291 --> 01:12:26,125
not the night before the exhibit's open.

958
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:29,416
I hear marketing has high hopes
of a traveling Dease collection.

959
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,041
They've even run projections.

960
01:12:31,125 --> 01:12:35,208
So, I believe my "leverage"
looking ahead is considerable.

961
01:12:35,291 --> 01:12:36,166
Mm-mmm.

962
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:38,916
There's absolutely no space in the fall
to put on a Minkins show.

963
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,250
Well, I'm going to meet
with your board tomorrow

964
01:12:41,333 --> 01:12:45,166
and suggest a reduction
in the emerging artist exhibit.

965
01:12:45,958 --> 01:12:47,416
They don't sell any tickets anyway.

966
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:50,583
Over my dead body.

967
01:12:58,291 --> 01:12:59,708
Um, Gretchen?

968
01:13:01,708 --> 01:13:04,291
The hard copy PR material's been sorted,

969
01:13:04,375 --> 01:13:06,666
and the electronic kits
get sent at midnight.

970
01:13:06,791 --> 01:13:07,791
Be here early.

971
01:13:08,125 --> 01:13:10,458
And inform me
of any celebrities or art stars.

972
01:13:12,166 --> 01:13:15,291
Um, if it's all right with you,
I'd like to go home

973
01:13:15,375 --> 01:13:17,000
and get a few hours of sleep?

974
01:13:17,791 --> 01:13:20,458
Has the lighting been corrected on Sphere?

975
01:13:21,166 --> 01:13:23,500
Oh, the side lights, yes.
I had them leave it lit,

976
01:13:23,583 --> 01:13:25,000
so you could see it when you leave.

977
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:27,500
Then run along.

978
01:13:30,625 --> 01:13:31,625
Good night.

979
01:15:14,416 --> 01:15:16,625
Help!

980
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,083
Help!

981
01:15:38,291 --> 01:15:39,291
Hello.

982
01:15:41,875 --> 01:15:42,875
No.

983
01:15:44,583 --> 01:15:45,583
When?

984
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,500
This morning.

985
01:15:49,166 --> 01:15:51,125
Somehow she got stuck inside of it.

986
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:57,541
There was some kind of malfunction,
and I guess it just, like,

987
01:15:58,416 --> 01:16:01,041
completely took her arm off
and she bled to death.

988
01:16:02,333 --> 01:16:03,333
It was horrible.

989
01:16:04,791 --> 01:16:07,291
Security guards thought
it was part of a new installation,

990
01:16:07,375 --> 01:16:09,208
so they just opened up and let people in.

991
01:16:10,916 --> 01:16:13,333
The Dease pop-up announcement
was blasted last night,

992
01:16:13,416 --> 01:16:14,791
so everyone was heading there.

993
01:16:16,416 --> 01:16:18,625
People just walked by
like she was part of an exhibit.

994
01:16:20,458 --> 01:16:22,250
Then a school tour came along.

995
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:25,666
The kids thought it was fake blood,

996
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:28,458
so they just started stepping in it
and spreading it around and...

997
01:16:29,333 --> 01:16:31,625
Who knows how long
it would have gone on for

998
01:16:31,958 --> 01:16:34,250
until Coco came in to do press
for the Dease show,

999
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
and she saw Gretchen and just lost it.

1000
01:16:42,458 --> 01:16:43,500
Are you still there?

1001
01:16:44,291 --> 01:16:45,375
Rhodora?

1002
01:16:45,625 --> 01:16:46,708
I don't understand.

1003
01:16:48,458 --> 01:16:50,875
Bryson, then Jon. Now Gretchen.

1004
01:16:51,375 --> 01:16:53,375
What the fuck is going on?

1005
01:16:53,875 --> 01:16:54,875
I don't know.

1006
01:16:56,416 --> 01:16:58,375
I mean, we just saw her last night.

1007
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,208
They closed that wing
of the museum, but...

1008
01:17:03,291 --> 01:17:05,375
I hear the Dease exhibit is mobbed.

1009
01:17:07,916 --> 01:17:09,625
Hey. Go.

1010
01:17:10,083 --> 01:17:13,041
We're spiking on Moments and Instagram.
It's a major hit.

1011
01:17:13,625 --> 01:17:15,291
Rhodora, are you still there?

1012
01:17:15,833 --> 01:17:17,166
Did you hear what I just said?

1013
01:17:17,833 --> 01:17:18,833
Yeah.

1014
01:17:19,125 --> 01:17:21,250
The Dease exhibit is booming.

1015
01:17:25,208 --> 01:17:26,875
There's someone at my door. I gotta go.

1016
01:17:37,791 --> 01:17:38,791
Did you...

1017
01:17:39,375 --> 01:17:40,541
hear about Gretchen?

1018
01:17:42,708 --> 01:17:43,708
Did you?

1019
01:17:45,458 --> 01:17:47,458
Oh, Jesus.

1020
01:17:47,791 --> 01:17:49,875
- Can you believe it?
- You have to leave.

1021
01:17:49,958 --> 01:17:52,125
You just can't,
well, just walk in like this!

1022
01:17:52,208 --> 01:17:54,958
Well, I need to be with someone right now.
I'd think you would, too.

1023
01:17:57,083 --> 01:17:58,125
What's going on?

1024
01:17:59,583 --> 01:18:01,666
Are you kidding me?

1025
01:18:03,458 --> 01:18:05,125
We're not together. I was clear.

1026
01:18:06,208 --> 01:18:07,625
You said, "a break."

1027
01:18:13,458 --> 01:18:16,333
The admiration I had for your work

1028
01:18:16,875 --> 01:18:19,958
has completely evaporated!

1029
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:23,458
Hey, man,
I wasn't trying to jump your train, okay?

1030
01:18:23,666 --> 01:18:24,875
She said you two were done.

1031
01:18:24,958 --> 01:18:26,666
Are we? Are we?

1032
01:18:28,625 --> 01:18:30,666
Say we don't share something real.

1033
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,125
I was never particularly obsessed.

1034
01:18:42,083 --> 01:18:43,083
Oh!

1035
01:19:33,666 --> 01:19:35,750
We expected you yesterday.

1036
01:19:35,833 --> 01:19:39,291
We closed the exhibit for half a day
in anticipation, actually.

1037
01:19:39,375 --> 01:19:41,750
I thought Artweb were clear on the timing.

1038
01:19:41,875 --> 01:19:44,333
I know, I'm sorry. It's my fault.

1039
01:19:44,416 --> 01:19:45,750
I know it's pre-debut.

1040
01:19:46,083 --> 01:19:48,208
Just been experiencing
some personal matters.

1041
01:19:48,833 --> 01:19:51,083
Then, of course, Gretchen this morning.

1042
01:19:51,708 --> 01:19:53,916
- If this isn't a good time...
- No, it's fine.

1043
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:55,500
It's overdue.

1044
01:19:56,166 --> 01:19:58,625
- I'll write my review and file it today.
- Hmm.

1045
01:19:59,583 --> 01:20:02,791
Lillith Vanlandingham
is storming the world

1046
01:20:02,875 --> 01:20:04,916
with her revolutionary
sound exhibits.

1047
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:09,291
She won the Nam June Paik Award last year.
Her latest piece is called Mysticete.

1048
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:13,416
As discussed, we have arranged for you
to experience the exhibit alone.

1049
01:20:22,416 --> 01:20:24,291
Look at him standing there.

1050
01:20:24,666 --> 01:20:26,458
He only embraces what he knows.

1051
01:20:26,541 --> 01:20:30,583
Undoubtedly one of the worst
exhibits of contemporary art history.

1052
01:20:30,666 --> 01:20:34,166
Piece for piece, it's the biggest
waste of steel since the Titanic.

1053
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:36,583
This painful exhibit should be bulldozed.

1054
01:20:36,666 --> 01:20:40,416
Remove the spotlight of hype
and his latest work is a snoozefest.

1055
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:42,708
Seriously, Ms. Minati,
I am talking to you.

1056
01:20:44,208 --> 01:20:47,291
It seems you have no one
around you to say this. Stop it.

1057
01:20:47,416 --> 01:20:49,166
Shut up the shed.

1058
01:20:49,250 --> 01:20:51,976
There are no redeeming qualities
to the show. Nothing but embarrassed...

1059
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,559
The best thing about the show
is the French rosé being offered.

1060
01:20:54,583 --> 01:20:57,226
It's an ugly piece
to look at, and faintly nauseating.

1061
01:20:57,250 --> 01:20:59,125
It's gone from innocent
and stupid...

1062
01:20:59,208 --> 01:21:01,059
I'll hate you forever for saying that!

1063
01:21:01,083 --> 01:21:04,291
- Lazily concealed.
- Vile. Deceitful!

1064
01:21:04,666 --> 01:21:07,125
Deceitful!

1065
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:08,750
Morf!

1066
01:21:08,833 --> 01:21:10,916
Judgment should be judged.

1067
01:21:12,958 --> 01:21:14,750
It is a monumental failure.

1068
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:16,375
Morf!

1069
01:21:20,916 --> 01:21:23,250
Ricky Blane is the classic case

1070
01:21:23,333 --> 01:21:25,958
of presenting a poser as cutting edge.

1071
01:21:35,875 --> 01:21:38,500
Sorry for the delay.
Our computer crashed.

1072
01:21:38,583 --> 01:21:40,333
We're... We'll start it now.

1073
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,750
What did I just hear?

1074
01:21:44,208 --> 01:21:46,583
Nothing. This is a soundproof room.

1075
01:21:47,916 --> 01:21:48,916
Voi...

1076
01:21:51,041 --> 01:21:52,041
Voices.

1077
01:21:53,041 --> 01:21:54,375
I've no idea.

1078
01:21:54,958 --> 01:21:58,125
Mysticete is a symphony
of whale intonation

1079
01:21:58,208 --> 01:22:02,375
recorded 20,000 feet under the sea
in the Mariana Trench.

1080
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,416
You are up for this?

1081
01:22:22,458 --> 01:22:23,833
I am seeing things.

1082
01:22:23,916 --> 01:22:28,250
I'm hearing things.

1083
01:22:28,333 --> 01:22:29,958
Unexplainable things.

1084
01:22:30,875 --> 01:22:32,250
Impossible things.

1085
01:22:33,708 --> 01:22:35,125
And this is hard to admit

1086
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:37,500
as an adherent of the here and now

1087
01:22:38,166 --> 01:22:40,750
and a denier of childish belief.

1088
01:22:40,833 --> 01:22:45,041
But something truly goddamn strange
is going on!

1089
01:22:49,375 --> 01:22:50,666
What happened to Bryson?

1090
01:22:50,791 --> 01:22:53,250
According to the police,
he had an accident

1091
01:22:53,333 --> 01:22:54,625
and he wandered into the desert.

1092
01:22:54,708 --> 01:22:56,291
I spoke to the police.

1093
01:22:56,375 --> 01:22:59,208
They have video surveillance of the night
that Bryson went missing.

1094
01:22:59,291 --> 01:23:01,625
He was loading crates of art
into his truck.

1095
01:23:01,708 --> 01:23:02,708
Okay.

1096
01:23:03,375 --> 01:23:05,000
What was in those crates?

1097
01:23:05,083 --> 01:23:06,375
And all this relates how?

1098
01:23:07,166 --> 01:23:08,208
Dease!

1099
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:13,541
His altered mental state, tortured soul,
phases of the goddamn moon!

1100
01:23:13,625 --> 01:23:14,916
I don't know how!

1101
01:23:15,333 --> 01:23:16,375
These deaths.

1102
01:23:16,833 --> 01:23:18,083
The disappearance.

1103
01:23:18,166 --> 01:23:20,375
Everything that is now happening,

1104
01:23:20,458 --> 01:23:22,666
it's all connected to his art.

1105
01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:26,500
Imbued with some spirit...

1106
01:23:27,416 --> 01:23:31,125
cr... created out of some vital ideal.

1107
01:23:31,208 --> 01:23:33,041
It's a bit Baroque, don't you think?

1108
01:23:33,125 --> 01:23:35,458
- I came here to warn you.
- Okay.

1109
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,916
You know what?
It's been a fucked-up few weeks!

1110
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,208
But listen to yourself!

1111
01:23:40,291 --> 01:23:42,208
I spoke to the building owners
doing research.

1112
01:23:43,416 --> 01:23:44,791
They were surprised

1113
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:47,250
to hear Dease's art was being sold.

1114
01:23:47,333 --> 01:23:48,458
Apparently,

1115
01:23:48,958 --> 01:23:53,583
he left explicit instructions
that it all be destroyed.

1116
01:23:53,666 --> 01:23:57,625
- What are you saying?
- Stop selling Dease!

1117
01:23:58,833 --> 01:24:00,892
It's an eight-figure collection...

1118
01:24:00,916 --> 01:24:03,791
...and you want me to stop selling
over some spirit?

1119
01:24:03,875 --> 01:24:05,875
I am writing an article about this.

1120
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:10,041
About Dease, his past, his methods,
everything that has gone down.

1121
01:24:10,541 --> 01:24:13,000
- Well, you'll kill your career.
- Get rid of it.

1122
01:24:13,458 --> 01:24:15,833
Box it all, all of it away.

1123
01:24:18,083 --> 01:24:19,250
That's what I'm doing.

1124
01:24:25,250 --> 01:24:27,250
All art is dangerous, Morf.

1125
01:24:30,916 --> 01:24:34,000
Oh, it's just been
a feeding frenzy since the debut.

1126
01:24:35,208 --> 01:24:38,416
What's changed is we ran new metrics
and realized that

1127
01:24:38,916 --> 01:24:41,291
we've been overly precious with supply.

1128
01:24:42,666 --> 01:24:44,750
I sent you six Dease JPEGs,

1129
01:24:44,833 --> 01:24:48,333
all available for immediate purchase
at the quoted price

1130
01:24:48,791 --> 01:24:52,041
and destined for significant appreciation.

1131
01:24:54,875 --> 01:24:56,833
All of them. Well, that's swell.

1132
01:24:58,416 --> 01:24:59,708
I'll send the papers.

1133
01:25:01,458 --> 01:25:03,083
Okay. Yeah.

1134
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:04,958
I'll see you in Basel.

1135
01:25:05,250 --> 01:25:06,625
What's going on?

1136
01:25:07,166 --> 01:25:09,916
We closed the first phase on Dease.
Why are we selling more?

1137
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Morf is hell-bent on writing a story.

1138
01:25:12,916 --> 01:25:15,125
He's connecting Bryson's disappearance

1139
01:25:16,041 --> 01:25:18,333
and Jon and Gretchen's deaths
to the Dease art.

1140
01:25:18,416 --> 01:25:21,208
He believes they're somehow
channeling some sort of...

1141
01:25:22,583 --> 01:25:23,416
spirit.

1142
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:25,166
Spirit?

1143
01:25:25,708 --> 01:25:27,041
What kind of spirit?

1144
01:25:27,125 --> 01:25:28,666
I don't know the varieties.

1145
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:31,625
So he writes some batshit story.
Who cares?

1146
01:25:31,708 --> 01:25:34,833
We don't sell durable goods,
we peddle perception.

1147
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,333
Thin as a bubble.

1148
01:25:36,916 --> 01:25:40,333
Call your buyers, sell as much Dease
as you can before he posts something.

1149
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:56,500
- Who's next?
- You have Roxy on one.

1150
01:25:58,291 --> 01:26:02,041
Hey, babe. Circling back on you
wanting some museum-quality Dease.

1151
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,360
Baby, that's raw silk. Your shoes.

1152
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:36,541
Pop this.

1153
01:26:42,250 --> 01:26:43,750
You've got strong hands.

1154
01:26:45,791 --> 01:26:47,375
You ever look at this painting?

1155
01:26:47,666 --> 01:26:49,750
You ever notice anything
about this painting?

1156
01:26:52,333 --> 01:26:54,083
You look at it long enough and it moves.

1157
01:27:06,708 --> 01:27:08,916
- Mmm.
- It's alive.

1158
01:27:11,666 --> 01:27:14,333
- I've just sold it.
- What? I would have bought it.

1159
01:27:15,375 --> 01:27:16,375
You couldn't afford it.

1160
01:27:17,833 --> 01:27:20,750
We don't want it.
Trust me, I'm doing you a favor.

1161
01:27:24,875 --> 01:27:27,291
I gotta get down to Traction Avenue.

1162
01:27:27,375 --> 01:27:29,267
- I thought we were spending the night in.
- Yeah.

1163
01:27:29,291 --> 01:27:31,833
Something just came up,
and I gotta take care of it tonight.

1164
01:27:32,541 --> 01:27:33,875
You're blowing me off.

1165
01:27:34,625 --> 01:27:36,958
I want you to come.

1166
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:51,000
Why do you keep calling me?

1167
01:27:51,125 --> 01:27:52,125
Why?

1168
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:56,541
We break up, and you write an article
to completely destroy my livelihood.

1169
01:27:56,625 --> 01:27:58,916
I am not doing this to get back at you.

1170
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:03,125
It's Dease's art. I think any of us
who profited from it are in danger.

1171
01:28:03,208 --> 01:28:04,875
So, you just blasted it out there?

1172
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:07,416
Jesus Christ. I am reading it right now.

1173
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:09,958
Are you aware
that you've completely lost your mind?

1174
01:28:10,041 --> 01:28:13,708
We don't realize the value of friends
until they're gone.

1175
01:28:15,625 --> 01:28:17,833
I still consider you a friend, Josephina.

1176
01:28:18,833 --> 01:28:21,375
Go fuck yourself and lose my number!

1177
01:28:23,416 --> 01:28:25,416
Well, fine, then. All right.

1178
01:28:32,208 --> 01:28:33,208
Hello?

1179
01:28:33,583 --> 01:28:34,583
It's Morf.

1180
01:28:34,666 --> 01:28:35,666
Oh, hi.

1181
01:28:35,833 --> 01:28:37,833
A timetable is moved up.

1182
01:28:38,583 --> 01:28:41,375
I'm storing some art
and I'm leaving immediately.

1183
01:28:41,458 --> 01:28:43,791
I need an assistant part-time here
while I'm gone.

1184
01:28:43,875 --> 01:28:46,958
- Well, I'm available.
- Yeah. Can you start tonight?

1185
01:28:47,166 --> 01:28:49,416
Um, I guess so. Sure.

1186
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:51,916
I need to give you the keys to my house
and my storage space.

1187
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,875
There's an overlook on Mulholland,
right off Cahuenga.

1188
01:28:56,166 --> 01:28:58,166
- I know the one.
- Good. I'll meet you there.

1189
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:09,125
Mr. Vandewalt. Hi.

1190
01:29:10,875 --> 01:29:12,458
I posted it, Coco.

1191
01:29:14,291 --> 01:29:16,125
And with this article, I'm... I'm...

1192
01:29:16,875 --> 01:29:19,125
I'm pouring gas on myself.
I'm lighting a match.

1193
01:29:19,916 --> 01:29:21,125
I don't have a choice.

1194
01:29:22,291 --> 01:29:24,291
It has been revealed to me

1195
01:29:25,291 --> 01:29:28,375
that there is some sort of larger power...

1196
01:29:30,291 --> 01:29:34,500
some entity invested in our endeavor.

1197
01:29:36,583 --> 01:29:37,666
Invested how?

1198
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:40,500
In...

1199
01:29:40,791 --> 01:29:42,166
the violation

1200
01:29:44,083 --> 01:29:45,500
of inviolate rules.

1201
01:29:48,041 --> 01:29:49,500
Have I gone mad?

1202
01:29:50,125 --> 01:29:52,041
Oh, not to me.

1203
01:29:52,125 --> 01:29:54,333
I found both bodies.

1204
01:29:54,416 --> 01:29:57,000
I'm sleeping with my lights on.

1205
01:29:57,500 --> 01:30:00,333
On top of which,
if I don't land a steady job soon,

1206
01:30:00,416 --> 01:30:02,000
I'm gonna have to go back to Michigan.

1207
01:30:08,666 --> 01:30:10,125
I have to tell you something.

1208
01:30:11,750 --> 01:30:12,750
What?

1209
01:30:13,583 --> 01:30:17,875
I was Rhodora's personal assistant, right?
I saw her checks, I rolled calls with her.

1210
01:30:18,625 --> 01:30:20,666
I think she sometimes forgot
when I was on them.

1211
01:30:20,875 --> 01:30:21,875
Tell me.

1212
01:30:23,750 --> 01:30:26,333
Your ex-boyfriend, Ed, um...

1213
01:30:27,333 --> 01:30:28,416
he worked for her.

1214
01:30:29,375 --> 01:30:31,791
He worked her out.
He's a personal trainer.

1215
01:30:32,291 --> 01:30:33,291
No.

1216
01:30:33,958 --> 01:30:35,041
No, I mean...

1217
01:30:36,125 --> 01:30:39,500
Rhodora paid Ed to give her
advance word on your reviews.

1218
01:30:40,083 --> 01:30:43,208
Like, okay... He would tell her
what you liked before you posted,

1219
01:30:43,291 --> 01:30:45,250
and then she'd make buys.

1220
01:30:51,791 --> 01:30:53,083
Do I still have the job?

1221
01:30:58,375 --> 01:31:02,166
Here are the keys to my storage space.
I need everything itemized that's there.

1222
01:31:02,541 --> 01:31:03,541
Okay.

1223
01:31:16,791 --> 01:31:18,583
Is my car safe out there?

1224
01:31:18,666 --> 01:31:20,166
How the fuck should I know?

1225
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,125
Where did you go?

1226
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,666
This is Ben.
He runs my old artist collective.

1227
01:31:30,333 --> 01:31:31,333
Hey.

1228
01:31:35,166 --> 01:31:37,750
Lovely. Can we go now?

1229
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,083
I'm staying.

1230
01:31:39,541 --> 01:31:41,375
But I don't really like this place.

1231
01:31:41,458 --> 01:31:43,166
Yeah, I'm talking longer timeline.

1232
01:31:43,250 --> 01:31:45,375
I'm leaving Rhodora, her gallery.

1233
01:31:46,291 --> 01:31:47,291
No, you're not.

1234
01:31:47,875 --> 01:31:49,166
I can't be there.

1235
01:31:49,666 --> 01:31:52,375
We have a significant show planned.
You're high. Come on.

1236
01:31:52,958 --> 01:31:53,958
I'm serious.

1237
01:31:57,875 --> 01:31:59,458
You're about to break big.

1238
01:32:00,333 --> 01:32:02,041
We're taking you global.

1239
01:32:02,833 --> 01:32:04,666
You'd give that up? For what?

1240
01:32:05,208 --> 01:32:07,958
Some sad garage space
peddling graffiti murals?

1241
01:32:08,041 --> 01:32:11,250
Jesus! What's the point of art
if nobody sees it?

1242
01:32:30,708 --> 01:32:31,750
Fuck!

1243
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:56,791
Yeah, there's a car blocking my car.
I want it towed.

1244
01:33:58,583 --> 01:34:00,083
I don't know.

1245
01:34:00,166 --> 01:34:01,958
Hang on.

1246
01:34:02,333 --> 01:34:05,000
Oh, 2057 Seventh Street.

1247
01:34:06,250 --> 01:34:07,291
I'm waiting.

1248
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:21,500
Hello?

1249
01:36:44,333 --> 01:36:46,333
I'm just waiting for a tow truck.

1250
01:37:26,291 --> 01:37:27,291
Oh, thank God.

1251
01:37:38,666 --> 01:37:39,666
Hello?

1252
01:37:39,750 --> 01:37:41,041
Damrish is leaving.

1253
01:37:42,375 --> 01:37:46,958
He met his old exhibitor in a dive bar
and told me he's going back. It's over.

1254
01:37:48,375 --> 01:37:49,375
Good for him.

1255
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,916
What do you mean, good for him?
What are you talking about?

1256
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:56,708
Josephina, are you aware that Dease asked
that all his art be destroyed?

1257
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,583
Would it have changed anything?

1258
01:38:00,333 --> 01:38:01,833
Would I have destroyed them?

1259
01:38:02,333 --> 01:38:03,333
No.

1260
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:05,708
He was a master.

1261
01:38:22,166 --> 01:38:23,833
Oh, Jesus. Hold on, Josephina.

1262
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Stella.

1263
01:38:26,291 --> 01:38:28,291
Stella. Stella.

1264
01:38:28,791 --> 01:38:30,666
Stella. God damn it.

1265
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,333
Have you ever felt invisible?

1266
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,958
Once, I built a railroad.

1267
01:39:24,541 --> 01:39:25,583
Rhodora?

1268
01:39:30,041 --> 01:39:31,041
Rhodora?

1269
01:39:39,791 --> 01:39:41,666
Come on, Stella.
Come on. Come on.

1270
01:39:41,750 --> 01:39:42,750
Stella, come.

1271
01:39:43,625 --> 01:39:46,291
Come on, good girl. Good girl.

1272
01:39:49,416 --> 01:39:51,000
Come on, Stella! Damn it!

1273
01:39:51,083 --> 01:39:52,250
Stella!

1274
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:53,500
Stella!

1275
01:40:03,458 --> 01:40:04,458
Rhodora?

1276
01:40:08,416 --> 01:40:09,458
Oh, my God.

1277
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Oh, my... Oh my...

1278
01:40:17,583 --> 01:40:18,583
Oh!

1279
01:40:21,666 --> 01:40:24,000
No, no! No! I understand!

1280
01:40:24,083 --> 01:40:27,500
I understand!

1281
01:40:31,375 --> 01:40:32,958
I can't save you.

1282
01:40:36,416 --> 01:40:40,166
Jesus Christ,
I can't believe what just happened.

1283
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:42,666
Josephina? Hello?

1284
01:41:02,458 --> 01:41:03,458
Oh.

1285
01:41:05,958 --> 01:41:06,958
Where...

1286
01:41:29,291 --> 01:41:32,916
Oh, fuck me!

1287
01:41:44,291 --> 01:41:45,291
What?

1288
01:41:47,458 --> 01:41:48,458
How?

1289
01:41:50,750 --> 01:41:52,583
A storage facility?

1290
01:41:54,625 --> 01:41:56,375
Well, what do they think happened?

1291
01:41:59,375 --> 01:42:01,625
No. I'm not coming in.

1292
01:42:02,375 --> 01:42:03,375
I gotta go.

1293
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,416
Pick up the phone.

1294
01:42:30,250 --> 01:42:32,041
Hey. Yeah, we got it.

1295
01:42:32,833 --> 01:42:34,041
No sign of the owner.

1296
01:42:35,041 --> 01:42:36,458
We're taking it to Central.

1297
01:42:37,041 --> 01:42:38,041
Yeah.

1298
01:43:22,625 --> 01:43:23,625
That's all of it.

1299
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:25,500
Everything?

1300
01:43:25,583 --> 01:43:28,333
Every image, every drawing,
every postcard,

1301
01:43:28,416 --> 01:43:29,875
every piece of art?

1302
01:43:30,166 --> 01:43:31,166
Uh-huh.

1303
01:43:32,500 --> 01:43:34,791
- Say it.
- It's completely empty.

1304
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,833
Forty-seven pieces. We removed everything.

1305
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Thank you.[

1306
01:44:28,166 --> 01:44:30,625
- LAX. Terminal five.
- Okay.

1307
01:46:10,083 --> 01:46:11,708
- That's lovely.
- Yeah.

1308
01:46:11,791 --> 01:46:12,958
How much?

1309
01:46:13,333 --> 01:46:14,875
I don't know. Five dollars.

1310
01:46:15,666 --> 01:46:16,666
Yeah.

1311
01:46:20,041 --> 01:46:21,041
Thank you.

1312
01:46:25,375 --> 01:46:26,375
Here you go.

1313
01:46:27,166 --> 01:46:28,416
- Thanks.
- Take care.
