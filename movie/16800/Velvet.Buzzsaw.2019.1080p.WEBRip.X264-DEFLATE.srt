你好  莫弗
Hey, Morf.

25
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,440
我要和这里的负责人谈谈
Okay, I wanna speak to someone in charge, please.

26
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,430
-很高兴再次见到你  -简直荒谬

我曾经建过铁路

你估计知道了  这是建治的作品  叫「流浪侠」
It's Kenji, you probably know. It's titled Hoboman.

35
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,990
反响非同一般
The response is amazing.

36
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,850
可以说  是整个艺术展的亮点
Arguably, the hit of the show.

沃夫森的「女性雕塑」  四年前的老把戏
Wolfson, Female Figure, four years ago.

38
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,110
不  这是全新的  截然不同的主题
No, it's new. Vastly different themes.

39
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,360
新瓶装旧酒罢了
It's an iteration.

40
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,320
毫无原创  没有勇气  我这样认为
No originality. No courage. My opinion.

41
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,860
我绝对尊重你个人观点的权威
Well, I absolutely respect the power of your point of view,

42
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,610
但这个作品涵盖全球
but this encompasses on a global scale.

43
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,400
当下感夺人眼球
There's just such a sense of now and in your face,

44
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,740
表达了流行音乐  电影和经济
which speaks to pop and cinema and economics.

45
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,490
你可以感受到一股末日之风

我救不了你

你有空吗
Do you have a minute?

51
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,280
没有  我要进去了
No, I'm just heading inside now.

52
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,760
-我要告诉你一件有关瑞奇的事  -怎么了
- I have to tell you something about Ricky. - What?

53
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,610
-约瑟芬娜  他出轨了  -你认真的吗
- Josephina, he's cheating on you. - Are you serious?

54
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,940
-我看见他和一个女孩在一起  -什么时候
- I saw him with this girl. - When?

55
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,350
昨晚在一个酒吧
Last night at a bar.

56
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,940
-什么  -他们都喝得很醉
- What? - They were both pretty drunk.

57
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,530
-几点钟  -不清楚  大约十点
- Wha... What time? - I don't know. Ten?

58
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,010
-他们打得火热  -就在酒吧里
- They were all over each other. - Right at the fucking bar.

59
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,030
-真遗憾  约瑟芬娜  -你确定是他吗
- I'm so sorry, Josephina. - Are you sure it was him?

60
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,780
他们就站在我旁边
They were standing right next to me.

61
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,570
我得挂了
I gotta go.

62
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,850
-有什么我能做的吗  -没有
- Anything I can do? - No.

63
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,390
谢了  真的  再见
Uh, thank you, seriously. Bye.

64
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,100
-还好吗  莫弗  -你好  乔恩
- Howzit, Morf? - Hello, Jon.

65
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,430
很了不起  是吧
Really something, eh?

66
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,940
皮尔斯和桃乐西有一腿吗
Is Piers sleeping with Dorothy?

67
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,220
那你得问他本人了
Oh, I'm certain you'd have to ask him that.

68
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:29,470
失陪
Excuse me.

69
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,470
-莫弗  亲爱的  -格雷琴
- Morf, love. - Oh, Gretchen.

70
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,620
我们为博物馆竞标下了这幅画
We bid on it for the museum.

71
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,490
乔恩想出370万买下
Jon wants three point seven.

72
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,280
洛多拉绝不会低于500万卖皮尔斯的作品
Rhodora would never sell a Piers for under five,

73
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,010
所以这对我们来说是个好机会
so it's a nice opportunity for us.

74
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,100
我很好奇你是怎么想的
I'm quite curious to know what you think.

75
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,530
我觉得戒酒对他不利
I think sober hasn't been good for him.

76
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,280
这是他在15年前完成的
Well, this was done fifteen years ago.

77
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,110
正是皮尔斯当时酗酒最严重的时候
Piers was in the full bloom of alcoholism here.

78
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,030
没错
Exactly.

79
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:54,010
所以你觉得这对博物馆来说挺划算
So, you're saying it is a good buy for the museum, then?

80
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,220
失陪
Excuse me.

81
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,680
约瑟芬娜
Josephina.

82
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,530
你还好吗
Are you okay?

83
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,510
绝对是最糟糕的一天了
Literally, the worst fucking day.

84
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,190
你的妆都花了
Ugh, your makeup.

85
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,410
天呐  我迟到了
God, I'm late.

86
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,110
他们给我发了得有20次信息了
They texted, like, twenty times.

87
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,260
我也要去那儿
I'm headed there, too.

88
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,650
那些人真操蛋
God, fucking people.

89
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,470
-谁  -所有人
- Who? - Everyone.

90
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,970
皮尔斯要换画廊了吗
Is Piers switching galleries?

91
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,900
我就负责接电话和买咖啡
I answer phones and get coffee.

92
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,010
就算是  我也会是最后知道的
I'd literally be, like, the last to know.

93
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,550
你来太晚了  洛多拉已经拿到咖啡了
You're too late. Rhodora already got her coffee.

94
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,640
你在这个位置真的满意吗
Are you where you wanna be?

95
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,600
我才不要听安装工扯这一套
I'm not taking shit from the installer.

96
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,110
你觉得怎么样
What did you think?

97
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,470
我好多年都没这种感觉了
I haven't felt that in years.

98
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,470
-莫弗来了  -谢谢  失陪了
- Morf is here. - Oh, thank you. Excuse me.

99
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:49,550
怎么样
Well?

100
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,970
色彩  生命力
Color. Life.

101
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,720
我很喜欢
I love it.

102
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,110
我受够了空白的空间
I'm sick of white spaces.

103
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,550
太奇怪了
That is so strange.

104
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,690
就作品和颜料而言  最近我疯狂沉迷于
I've been drawn to a bolder booth presence in terms

105
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,510
更大胆的选择
of work and palette lately.

106
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,530
坚持使用空洞  单色的立方体来构图
This adherence to showing in sterile, monochrome cubes.

107
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,280
那只是偷懒罢了  我想把几种东西并列起来  
It's just laziness. I wanted to get some juxtaposition going.

108
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,900
我其实正在写
I'm actually, I mean right now,

109
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,100
有关这方面的东西
writing something exactly about this.

110
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,140
这不在目录里面
This wasn't in the catalog.

111
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,140
这是明金斯的作品
It's Minkins.

112
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,390
叫做「球体」
It's called Sphere.

113
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:26,650
它能根据不同的人
It creates this unique sensation,

114
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,820
及他们决定去探索的洞
depending on each person

115
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,890
创造出独特的感受
and whatever hole they decide to explore.

116
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,510
就和生活一样
Just like life.

117
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,180
它使用了各种传感器和小装置
It uses all sorts of sensors and gizmos.

118
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,970
它是关于选择  欲望  性
It's about choice, desire, sex.

119
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,850
一应俱全
The whole enchilada.

120
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,900
-这是突破性的  -由你来让它突破
- It's groundbreaking. - Hmm, it's yours to break.

121
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,470
十分钟前才首次亮相
Debuted ten minutes ago.

122
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,100
我要发一个评论  这个作品多少钱
I'm posting a review. How much is it?

123
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,530
谈钱比谈艺术容易多了
So much easier to talk about money than art.

124
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:53,510
有意思
Funny.

125
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,470
说起来  皮尔斯要离开你投靠乔恩·敦顿
Speaking of, is Piers leaving you for Jon Dondon?

126
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,680
我做皮尔斯代理人已经17年了
I've represented Piers for seventeen years.

127
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,220
你没回答我问题
That's not an answer.

128
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,350
你把手伸进去吧
Well, why don't you put your hand in?

129
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,800
看看有什么感觉
See what you feel.

130
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,530
-这不值得我去投资  -你错了
- It's just not worth my investment. - You're mistaken.

131
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,940
这将会是前所未有的体验
This is gonna be an uncommon event experience,

132
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,650
更不用说税收激励了
not to mention the tax incentive.

133
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,070
-迈阿密有水吗  -在酒吧那边  先生
- Is there water in Miami? - At the bar, sir.

134
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,570
-我不清楚  -操
- I don't know. - Fuck.

135
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:30,540
可以确保你得到联合主席的职位
I can guarantee your position as co-chair--

136
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,300
失陪  皮尔斯
Oh, excuse me. Piers.

137
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,690
在海洋中漂流着  而在绝妙的时刻
I was floating in the ocean, and, for this incredible moment,

138
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,970
我感受到自己的原始意识被激发了
it felt like I had tapped into a primal consciousness.

139
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,930
我与这个世界最存粹的形式相连
A connection to the world in its purest form.

140
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,070
瑞奇还不承认
Ricky's still denying it.

141
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,650
"求你了  宝贝  听我解释"
"Please, baby, let me explain."

142
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,490
我发誓  我想伤害他
I swear to God, I want to hurt him.

143
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,890
也许这能让你解脱去尝试新鲜的东西
Maybe it will free you up for new things.

144
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,430
我们的关系就是新鲜东西  他才搬进来
This was a new thing. He'd just moved in.

145
00:07:59,150 --> 00:07:59,940
我不得不说
I have to say,

146
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:04,220
我对跟艾德的关系有了迟疑
I'm having my own major second thoughts about Ed.

147
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,890
他居然对我们结婚抱有幻想
He actually has some fantasy about us getting married.

148
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,600
我不会再跟艺术家约会了
I'm through dating artists.

149
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,720
他们已经在跟艺术谈恋爱了
They're already in a relationship.

150
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,030
听我说  达米什
Look, Damrish,

151
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,740
你的网站并没给人规模感和质感
your website doesn't give a sense of scale or texture.

152
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,860
但是亲眼在新艺术家博览会上看到你的作品
But seeing your work in person at the new-artists fair,

153
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,220
让我很是震惊
I had that "Oh, my God" moment.

154
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:28,470
它会控制你  向你攻击  吞噬你
It charges and mauls and devours.

155
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:31,190
六个月前  我流落街头
Six months ago, I was living on the street,

156
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,850
在人行道上展览
showing on the sidewalk.

157
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,220
我的背景就是这样的  对吧
So, that's where I'm coming from, right?

158
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,510
让我跟你说清楚
Let me fill you in.

159
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,140
所有这些
All this...

160
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,360
只是猎杀下一个新事物然后吃掉它
it's just a safari to hunt the next new thing and eat it.

161
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,260
我听说要对你格外小心
I heard you were the one to watch out for.

162
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,430
我是小菜一碟
I'm easy-peasy.

163
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,850
其实就是小猫
Pussycat, really.

164
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:50,530
我了解你的一切  之前那段朋克时光
I know all about you, going back to your punk days.

165
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,190
那可是很久之前的事了
Oof, that was many moons ago.

166
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,440
-天鹅绒圆锯乐队  -是的  名字很夺眼球
- Velvet Buzzsaw. - Yeah, well, the name was catchy.

167
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,140
早期的作品很棒
Yeah, the early stuff was great.

168
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,390
然后呢  变成自嘲的黑历史了
Then it became, what? Like, self-parody?

169
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,180
波莉离开后
I mean, after Polly left,

170
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,970
你们怎么就解散了
why'd you split up?

171
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,820
那时候酗酒嗑药那么多 谁还记得
Who remembers through all the booze and pills.

172
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,300
但重点是
But the point is,

173
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,850
我从无政府主义者变成了有品位的供应商
I've gone from anarchist to purveyor of good taste.

174
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,970
所以  我懂其中的把戏
So, I get the joke.

175
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,010
这都不新鲜  自从收取一块骨头来看壁画
None of this is new. It's all been done since

176
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:20,430
就有人这么干了
someone charged a bone to see the first cave painting.

177
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,470
给
Here you are.

178
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,760
所以  谢谢你
So... Thank you.

179
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,800
你在哪个画廊展览
What cave are you showing in?

180
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,300
我和我的兄弟们搞了个系列
Me and my dudes started a collective.

181
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,470
为它干杯
Well, cheers to that.

182
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,260
谁都知道我喜欢忠诚
Well, hell knows, I love loyalty,

183
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,850
但我巴不得展出你的作品
but I would kill to exhibit you.

184
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,610
我刚拒绝乔恩·敦顿给我办个人作品展
I just turned down an offer for a full show from Jon Dondon.

185
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:46,820
真是没完没了
And on and on.

186
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,350
他正在里面想把皮尔斯挖过去
He's inside right now trying to poach Piers.

187
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,680
你知道我在哪吗  达米什
You know where I am, Damrish?

188
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,600
我在这儿和你一起喝酒
I'm here doing shots with you.

189
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,050
苏打汽水加青柠
Club soda. Lime.

190
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,800
整个市场一直都对你翘首以盼  皮尔斯
The market always tiers up for you, Piers.

191
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,530
听我说  我已经受不了你这些屁话
Listen, my intolerance for your bullshit is zero.

192
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,180
好的  不说屁话
Lekker, no bullshit.

193
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,940
洛多拉给你报价过高
Look, Rhodora overpriced you.

194
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,860
她失去理智了  完全不了解最新的情况
She's lost it. She's completely out of touch.

195
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,280
我今天以370万的价格卖出了「颅骨」
I sold Cranial today for three point seven,

196
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,570
和我预期的一样
exactly what I said I'd get.

197
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,990
如果你加入我  我们画廊有最顶尖的分析技术

199
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,490
我正在努力重新创作  去启发
I am fighting to get back to creation, to revelation,

200
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,940
我们大脑中闪烁了数十亿年的能量
the billion years of energy sparking through our brain.

201
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:31,070
我才不会满世界乱跑去卖展览的门票
I'm not jetting around, hawking fucking tickets.

202
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,570
在注意力经济中  名人就是艺术形式的一种
In an attention economy, celebrity is art form.

203
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,110
你知道我只委托新的作品吗
Do you understand that I only commission new work?

复刻  印刷和仿制品都是以我自己的品牌销售
Repros, prints, replicas are all marketed under my own brand.

205
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,190
老兄  能与你在未来的作品上
My boet, I'm more than ecstatic

206

我听说洛多拉把「球体」卖了700万美元
I hear Rhodora sold Sphere for seven million.

208
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,240
老天  那作品不过是个嘉年华
Man, it's a carnival attraction.

209
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,510
那作品很棒
It's brilliant.

210
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,350
我不该戒酒的
I never should've quit drinking.

你要去SLS吗
Are you going to SLS?

213
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,260
我要去城外的一个小展览
I'm going to a satellite show outside of town.

214
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,050
我也去
Well, I'll come.

215
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,650
你怎么了
What's going on with you?

216
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,550
你什么意思
What do you mean?

217
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,240
你他妈可是莫弗·范德瓦尔特
You're Morf fucking Vandewalt.

218
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,890
你和我去一个资助的展览做什么
What are you doing coming to a grant show with me?

219
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,510
我喜欢和你在一起
I like being with you.

220
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,970
我们品味相投
We have a taste relationship.

221
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,100
你抽的是烟吗
Is that tobacco?

222
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,430
大麻油
Hash oil.

223
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,550
要不我也来一小口
Maybe I'll have one little puff.

224
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,900
那是我这几年来看过最差的展览
Okay, that was the worst show I've seen in years.

225
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,760
我们走的时候那个发火的人是谁
And who was that angry guy when we left?

226
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,600
你不认识
You don't know?

227
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,260
那是伊梅尔德斯·范德霍斯特  你去年抨击过他
That was Imeldus Vanderhorst. You panned him last year.

228
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,850
从冰箱里拿两瓶酒出来
Grab two Tito's from the fridge.

229
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,680
你的身材比瑞奇的好多了

230
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,760
我经常做普拉提和骑自行车

我也记得你的

自打柏林之后  我一直都在想你
Ever since Berlin, I find myself thinking all the time about you.

234
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,970
我们当时都醉了
We were wasted.

235
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,760
我也一直这样告诉自己
I keep telling myself that.

236
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:31,800
你的皮肤
Your skin.

237
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:37,050
是杏仁色和马鞍棕之间最美丽的融合
It's the most beautiful cross between almond and saddle brown.

238
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,220
我让你硬了吗
I make you hard, huh?

239
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,600
你让我困惑了
You make me confused.

240
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,510
这对一个评论家来说太难了
Tough headspace for a critic.

241
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,600
昨天很晚回到洛杉矶  看了下数据
Got back to LA late last night and looked at the numbers.

242
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,760
我的天
My God.

243
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,280
除了明金斯的作品卖了个好价
Aside from the peachy Minkins sale,

244
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,640
迈阿密不是一个非常繁荣的市场
Miami was really not a very great thriving market.

245
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,300
实际上  鲁贝克的作品一件都没卖出去
Brass tacks, we didn't move one Rubek.

246
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,650
我知道伦敦办事处很想把他挖过去
I know the London office has a hard-on for him,

247
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:26,650
但在我看来
but to my mind,

248
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,650
他们最不应该把时间浪费在
the last thing we need to waste time

249
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,970

赶紧启发自己和我一起跳进泳池吧
Well, get inspired and come join me in the pool.

258
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:24,640

00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:07,220

Hang up, right? Yeah, rich people are impatient.

267
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,100
我其实也算是个艺术家
I'm really an artist, you know?

268
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:16,640
我画了《班迪尼水果圈河马》  知道吗
I did, um, Bandini's Froot Loop Hippo, you know that?

00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,470
然后我贴在所有水果圈麦片上
And I glued on all the Froot Loops.

270
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:20,640

现在放在布罗德博物馆呢
It's at The Broad right now.

272
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,110
不是布洛德  人们总是搞混

273
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,140
-布罗德  布洛德  -好吧

I have solid confirmation Piers has left you for Jon Dondon.

278
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,190

I'm going to get bored now.

279
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,940
我倒觉得这很严重  他为什么离开
This feels huge to me. Why would he leave?

280
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,180
{\an8}没有死亡
没有艺术

281
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,100
为什么  为什么  什么为什么
Why, why why. Why anything?

282
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,280
也许我希望他离开
Maybe I wanted him to leave.

283
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,030
同时我还签了新的艺术家
Meanwhile, I'm signing new talent.

284
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,320
听说你签了达米什  他很厉害
Heard you got Damrish. He's fierce.

285
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,900
今天早上还签了玛蒂尔达·斯普拉德
And this morning, Mertilla Splude.

286
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,430
我发誓  我们俩真是太搭了
We are on the same frequency, I swear.

287
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:00,840
Go-Pro幼儿园绝对会轰动
Go-Pro Kindergarten's gonna break big.

288
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,350
你简直就是上帝的枕边人
Your lips, God's ear.

289
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:05,930
等等  在我们的世界中  你就是神
Oh, wait. In our world, you are God.

290
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,690
我要迟到了  先挂了
And I'm running late. Gotta go.

291
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,680
好的
Okay.

292
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,140
对不起
I'm sorry.

293
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:17,390
我们楼里突然死了个人
Some random guy just, like, died in my building.

294
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,600
我真是太惊讶了
I really am so surprised.

295
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,350
洛多拉  我没和你开玩笑
Rhodora, I'm not kidding.

296
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,740
我的一个邻居真的死了  是我发现尸体的
A neighbor actually died. I found the body.

297
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,820
布莱森随时向我汇报
Bryson keeps me up to speed on everything

298
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,070
这里发生的事
that goes on around here.

299
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,530
包括你经常迟到
Your chronic lateness--

300
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,260
布莱森不爽是因为
Bryson's pissed because...

301
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:34,070
他追求过我  我拒绝了
he came on to me and I shut him down.

302
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,610
他就是个混蛋
He's a flat-out creeper.

303
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:38,570
我只能说  曾经我对你抱有的兴趣已经消磨光了
Well, I can say the interest I had in you has waned.

304
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,740
我原以为能好好培养你
I thought I was grooming a protégé.

305
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,860
我们曾经就你的挣扎和远大理想进行过无数次长谈
All our long talks about your struggles and grand ambitions.

306
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,860
而你却侮辱了我的智商
And then you insult my intelligent mind.

307
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,530
我要把你从前台撤下来了
I'm moving you off the front.

308
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:49,940
不准再接触客户
No client contact

309
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,640
等你好好提升自己的艺术标准吧
until you raise the quality bar in your performance.

310
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,070
-早上好  -早上好
- Morning. - Good morning.

311
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:59,760
柏林  新加坡  伦敦的都上线了吗  看到了
Do we have Berlin? Singapore? London? Oh, we do.

312
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,570
我最近看上了两名新的艺术家
So, I have two new favorite artists

313
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:04,010
我想向你们好好介绍一下
I am all kinds of happy to tell you about.

314
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,970
我是佩拉克公司的
I'm from Perlack.

315
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,680
{\an8}维特利尔·迪斯

316
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,100
这幢楼是我们的
We own the building.

317
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,100
你认识他吗
Did you know him?

318
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,430
死掉的那个人
The guy who died?

319
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,350
好像是什么艺术家
Some sorta artist, I guess.

320
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,050
不认识
No.

321
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,220
是我找到他的尸体的
I found his body.

322
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,140
他很注重自己的隐私
He liked his privacy.

323
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,650
-他有一只猫  -还在里面  我们明天找
- He had a cat. - It's up there. We'll find it tomorrow.

324
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,350
天啊  房间里的东西...
Jesus, the stuff inside...

325
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,150
都要扔了
And it all gets tossed.

326
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,490
那老家伙本来希望把所有东西都扔了
The old man wanted everything thrown away.

327
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,260
他吩咐的  不留任何痕迹
No trace, his instructions.

328
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,150
看来他都开始自己动手扔了
Looks like he started to do it himself,

329
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,260
可惜还没扔完  自己就死了
but he died before he could finish the job.

330
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:08,430
晚安
Well, good night.

331
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,350
猫咪  猫咪
Hey, kitty, kitty.

332
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,180
小家伙
Hey, little guy.

333
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,220
你打来真是太好了
So glad you called.

334
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,740
我也想抱你  但我浑身是汗
I'd hug, but I'm all sweaty.

335
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,680
这件针织衫真不错  玉米色很衬你
Love the jumper. Cornsilk's a great color for you.

336
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,800
迈阿密堪称天启
Miami was a revelation.

337
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,800
我就这么说吧
Let me just start with that.

338
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:40,150
我不知道我的生命中还有其他
I don't know where I am with anything else in my life,

339
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,760
能比我和你一起时...
other than that I feel...

340
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,550
感觉更好
good with you.

341
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,680
好多了  超乎寻常
So much better, and beyond good.

342
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,430
我发现了一点东西
I found something.

343
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,260
我就是这个意思
That's what I'm saying.

344
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,600
这是谁画的
Who did these?

345
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,140
你觉得这些画怎么样
What do you think of them?

346
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,260
颇有远见
They're visionary.

347
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,140
令人痴迷  非常令人震惊的...
Mesmeric. An absolute incredible...

348
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:46,100
素材结合
mix of mediums.

349
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,510
我完全倾倒了
I'm ensorcelled.

350
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,800
-你觉得这些画有市场吗  -大市场
- Do you think there's a market for it? - Massive.

351
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,180
超大
Beyond.

352
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:02,800
谁代理的
Who represents them?

353
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,140
我
I do.

354
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,100
我的好奇心快溢出来了
I'm dying with suspense.

355
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:11,970
是谁
Who is it?

356
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:16,610
今晚的大奖为四亿
Tonight's jackpot is 400 million dollars.

357
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:20,260
要赢得大奖  必须五个白球上的号码全中
To win that jackpot, you must match these five white balls.

358
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,110
第一个号码是54   接下来是32
The first winning number tonight is 54. That's followed by 32.

359
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:29,550
接下来是52  下一个是34
Up next we have 52. Your next number is 34.

360
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:33,680
本周五晚最后一个白球上的号码是25
Your final white ball for this Friday evening is 25.

361
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,680
如果没有人的号码全中
If no one matches the five numbers--

362
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:39,220
双年展时好像看起来很前卫一点
It just seemed edgier at the Biennale.

363
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,640
用的就是当初的灯光吗
Oh, is this the exact lighting?

364
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,720
应该是的
I think so.

365
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,300
你去核实一下规格
Okay, well, go check the specs.

366
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,640
我负责达米什那个系列的
I run the collective Damrish belongs to.

367
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,350
我不知道系列还有专门的负责人
I didn't think collectives had people in charge.

368
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,720
那不是就和系列的初衷不符了吗
Doesn't that defeat the whole purpose?

369
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,430
我代理他的
I represent him.

370
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:17,600
曾经代理
Used to.

371
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:21,400
我们要创造跟这些商业垃圾完全不一样的东西
We're building something away from all this commercial bullshit.

372
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,110
这不仅仅为了什么钱
It's not just about the fucking money.

373
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:25,650
你夺走达米什会毁了我们
Stealing Damrish away would end us.

374
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:28,030
你知道吗  他已经不是小孩子了
Okay. Well, you know what? He's not a child.

375
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,800
这是他的选择  不是我的
It's his choice, not mine.

376
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,850
-你觉得这就完了吗  -给我后退
- You think this is done? - Back the fuck up!

377
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,850
我想阻止他的来着
I tried to stop him.

378
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,850
你失败了
Okay, well, you failed.

379
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,510
难以置信
Unbelievable.

380
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:49,300
-以后不会...再发生这种事了  -出去
- It will... never happen again. -Go!

381
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,180
可可  你不是和我说过你想要一只猫吗
Coco! Didn't you tell me you wanted to get a cat?

382
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,050
我们能等会再聊吗
Can we talk about it later?

383
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,510
好的
Sure.

384
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,300
你以为你在干什么
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

385
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:21,780
这是什么  这是谁画的
What is this? Who is this?

386
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,820
这是放在我桌子下的
That was under my desk.

387
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,530
我在找胶带  然后就看到了
I was looking for tape and I saw this.

388
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:27,990
-你这是骚扰  -告诉我这个艺术家是谁
- This is harassment. - Tell me who the artist is.

389
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,240
你到底什么毛病
What the fuck is wrong with you?

390
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,470
我不仅仅只是个维修和打包的人
I do more than maintenance and packing.

391
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,390
我不是个单单四肢发达的家伙
I'm not just a man of primitive skills.

392
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,850
这东西...和我有共鸣
This shit... talks to me.

393
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,990
你好啊  我听说了你要来
Hey, you. I heard you were coming by.

394
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:54,680
我在评估你的珀尔福展览
I'm reviewing your Purlfoy exhibit.

395
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,430
行行好  我们人手越来越少了
Be kind. Our membership is plummeting.

396
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:58,930
告诉我
Tell me something.

397
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:02,010
你有没有听说过一个叫维特利尔·迪斯的艺术家
Have you ever heard of an artist named Vetril Dease?

398
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:05,350
-迪斯  -没听说过
- D-e-a-s-e. - No.

399
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,470
你能查一下吗
Can you check?

400
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,260
我们的记录中没有  我们可是记录了所有人
No. Not in our records, and we have everyone.

401
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,050
莫弗  亲爱的  我
Morf, honey, I, uh...

402
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,470
我要和你说一件事
I need to bend your ear.

403
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:28,600
我要离开这里  去当艺术顾问了
I am leaving to become an art adviser.

404
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:31,190
我知道  我知道  我不能说是为谁
I know, I know. I can't say for whom.

405
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,740
但是我赚的钱
But I will be making enough

406
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:35,320
足够买一辆超棒的车和一个花园了
to afford a terribly lovely car and garden.

407
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,930
你好  莫弗
Oh, hello, Morf.

408
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,140
你好  吉姆
Hello, Jim.

409
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,900
我当初来艺术馆
Look, I came to the museum

410
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,820
就是为了想通过艺术改变世界
because I wanted to change the world through art.

411
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:49,030
但是财富吞噬了一切  只剩下一些碎屑
But the wealthy vacuum up everything, except crumbs.

412
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,740
只有少数人才能欣赏优秀的作品
The best work is only enjoyed by a tiny few.

413
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,760
那些人听人说该买什么就买什么  何不加入他们呢
And they buy what they're told. So, why not join the party?

414
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,100
什么事都离不开钱
It's everywhere, the money question.

415
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,470
为了做好铺垫  我正在
In advance of my move, I am...

416
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:03,050
积极地为我的新客户寻找艺术品
actively looking for purchases for my new client.

417
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:06,100
你说不定会感兴趣
You might be interested to know

418
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:09,110
我可以给你提供一大笔
that I can provide to you a generous,

419
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,360
无法追迹的钱
untraceable reward for anything

420
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,510
只要你给我提供一些
you steer me to in the realm of

421
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:16,800
定价过低或是提前评估的作品
undervalued, pre-review, perhaps.

422
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,510
我不做这种生意
I don't do that.

423
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,140
那你和洛多拉的协议呢
What's your arrangement with Rhodora?

424
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:26,930
没有协议
None.

425
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:31,130
那她总是在你给出好评价之前买下作品
Then her buys prior to your favorable reviews

426
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,240
都只是有先见之明吗
are utterly prescient?

427
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,300
我的人生就是这样
This is my life.

428
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:37,430
我能和作品有一些精神上的联系
How I connect with some sort of spirituality at actual present.

429
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,800
当然了
Of course.

430
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,140
我的评价是出于我的欣赏
I assess out of adoration.

431
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,550
我拓宽了我分析作品的领域
I further the realm I analyze.

432
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:45,720
原谅我  我...
Forgive me, I...

433
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,180
操
Fuck.

434
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,970
亲亲
Kisses.

435
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:17,850
怎么了
What's going on?

436
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:20,260
你说呢
You tell me.

437
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,600
你来这里干什么
What are you doing here?

438
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,930
上帝啊
Hell's bells.

439
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,100
布莱森
Bryson.

440
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,390
-了不起  -我要请你离开了
- Incredible. - I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

441
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:39,970
除非你用枪指着我
Not if you had a gun.

442
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,350
这不关你的事
It's none of your business.

443
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,510
其实还真有关系
Oh, actually it is.

444
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:48,070
你签署了竞业限制条款  如果你好好读了
You signed a non-compete clause, which, if you read,

445
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,600
你也许会记得
you might remember is

446
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:53,220
你要做的可远不止那些
very much quite a lot broader than that.

447
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,300
和我说说维特利尔·迪斯
Tell me all about Vetril Dease.

448
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,850
他的名字简直就是树上的金箔
His name is the tinsel on the tree.

449
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,930
别让我对你进行拷问了
Don't make me pull some sort of heavy interrogation.

450
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:10,180
现在  只有我和你
Right now, it's just you and me,

451
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:14,350
毕竟我们俩之间还有友谊和爱
with all our active friendship and love for each other.

452
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:19,600
你怎么得到这些画的
Now, how did you get all of these?

453
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,300
楼上的一个人  他死了
A guy upstairs. He died.

454
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,100
你就拿走了吗
And you just took them?

455
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,890
他没有家属和朋友
He had no family or friends.

456
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,610
我就不问那些显而易见的问题了
Well, I won't bother with the obvious questions,

457
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:37,550
不过  你肯定有一些大计划吧
but, oh, you must have some giant plans.

458
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,760
我是单干的行家
I invented do-it-yourself.

459
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:43,760
你绝对搞不定的  宝贝
And you're in way over your head, babe.

460
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:48,760
你必须归档  分类并确认所有权
You have to archive and catalog and establish ownership.

461
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:51,890
还要货币化
And monetize.

462
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:58,430
我愿意帮你做好这一切...只要合理分成
I'm willing to do all of that for... a reasonable percentage.

463
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,510
你可以跟我进行无尽的诉讼  或者
You can engage me in an endless lawsuit, or...

464
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:06,800
你可以变得有钱  出名并成功
you can become rich and famous and successful.

465
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,890
我们都知道这是你一直以来梦寐以求的
Which is what we both know you've always wanted.

466
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:26,860
我们可以说这些是被人遗弃的
We can claim the property was abandoned

467
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,280
前提是她说她是在垃圾桶里找到的
if she says she found it in the dumpster.

468
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,940
并着手寻找合适的主人
And took steps to find a rightful owner.

469
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,820
初步报道声称他没有继承人
Well, first reports are he had no heirs.

470
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:34,300
她只是个租客  大楼主人不能发个声明吗
She's just a tenant. Could the building owner make a claim?

471
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,800
那个处理的人说他们把所有东西都扔了
The salvage guy said that they were junking everything.

472
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:39,490
我花了好几个小时才把这些全搬到我的公寓
I mean, it took hours to carry it all down into my apartment.

473
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:40,490
实在是太多了
There was just so much of it.

474
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:44,490
不  你是在垃圾桶里找到画的  不是他的公寓
No, you found the art in the trash, not in his apartment.

475
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:45,530
这是很重要的
This is very important.

476
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:49,150
回想一下  你是在垃圾桶里找到的
Now, remembering back, you found it in the dumpster.

477
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,220
是那样的吗
Isn't that what happened?

478
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,220
垃圾桶
The dumpster.

479
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,680
没错  我记起来了
Yeah, I remember now.

480
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:13,510
艺术评论太过局限又耗费心神
Critique is so limiting and emotionally draining.

481
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:18,430
我一直想要表达一种长期的  超脱的观点
I've always wanted to do something long-form, beyond opinion.

482
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:23,390
将我的脚趾沉浸在对于原始和精华的探索中
Dip my toe into an exploration of origin and essence.

483
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:26,720
灵体到现实的转变
A metamorphosis of spirit into reality.

484
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,140
我一直没找到表达的载体  现在终于有了
I've... I've never had the vehicle until now.

485
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,610
一位艺术家在逆境中创作
An artist toiling in the recesses,

486
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:37,320
被发现死亡  我想立刻开始研究
discovered in death. I wanna start researching immediately.

487
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,400
有个时间的问题  要和我们庞大的市场布局吻合
Well, there's timing. Meshing with our extensive marketing plans,

488
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,360
我们还没进展到那部分
which we haven't gotten to yet.

489
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,610
我愿意写展览册
Well, I'm willing to write the exhibit brochure.

490
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,550
能立刻推动展览启动
That will give immediate weight to the launch.

491
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,320
相应地  我想独家拥有一本书
And in return, I want exclusive rights to a book

492
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,100
和一些画作
and several pieces.

493
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,930
听上去不错
Well, that sounds swell.

494
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:14,640
洛多拉
Hi, Rhodora.

495
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,940
我在归档他的材料
Well, I'm archiving his material,

496
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:21,640
然后对画作进行光谱解析
then running spectrums on his paint.

497
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,680
最奇怪的事情发生了
And it's the damnedest thing.

498
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,930
我都不知道怎么说明
I don't even know how to account for it.

499
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,300
让我不得不大胆猜测
I couldn't hazard a guess.

500
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,390
迷雾画廊  请稍等

迷雾画廊  请稍等

502
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,550
迷雾画廊  请稍等
Haze Gallery, please hold.

503
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:42,760
约瑟菲娜现在不方便接电话  但我能捎个信
Yes, Josephina's unavailable right now, but I can take a message.

504
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,930
好  请稍等
Okay, please hold.

505
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,350
迷雾画廊

506
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:49,360
对  洛多拉知道开会的事
Uh, yes. Rhodora is aware of the meeting,

507
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,850
但她正在打电话
but she's on a call right now.

508
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,440
你确定是同一个人吗
You're positive it's the same Dease?

509
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,690
-对  -你怎么那么肯定
- Yeah. - Well, how can you be sure?

510
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,740
我去了精神病院  找到了他的病历
I visited the institution. I found his records.

511
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,260
-天啊  -换我不会担心
- Dear God. - I wouldn't worry.

512
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,740
这些文件太老了  没备份  我拿走了唯一一份
The file's so old, there's no backup. I took the only copy.

513
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:09,010
好吧  发过来  剩下的不用管了
Okay, send it over. And wash your hands of it.

514
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:11,470
-支票多加一个零  -谢了
- And add a zero to your bill. - Thanks.

515
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:22,050
维特利尔·迪斯最早出现于1930年洛城人口普查
Vetril Dease first appears in a 1930 Los Angeles census,

516
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,990
跟他的父亲  母亲
living in a low-income home

517
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:26,390
和妹妹住在一处低收入住房
with his father, mother and younger sister.

518
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:30,150
九年后  维特利尔和父亲成为了仅有的幸存者
Nine years later, Vetril is listed with his father

519
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,390
{\an8}诡异大火烧死母亲和女儿

520
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:34,180
他们的房子被一场诡异的火灾吞噬
as the only survivors of a suspicious fire which swept their house.

521
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:38,030
大火之后不久  维特利尔出现在法庭文件中
Shortly after the fire, Vetril's named in a court document.

522
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:40,690
据记载  毫无人性的是
Citing cruelty beyond the bounds of humanity,

523
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,940
儿童保护组织将他从虐待狂父亲身边带走
child protection services remove Vetril from his abusive father

524
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:47,550
送去了位于南瓦莱乔的圣殿骑士孤儿院
and place him in the Good Templars Orphanage in South Vallejo.

525
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:50,390
那段时间的经历是个谜
His time there is a mystery,

526
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:54,220
唯一的记录就是他18岁时离开了
the only record being his departure at 18.

527
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:57,990
但真正的谜题是接下来发生的事
But the real mystery is what follows.

528
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:02,690
迪斯消失了三十年  人间蒸发
Dease disappears for three decades, vanishing like a ghost.

529
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,250
{\an8}萨特勒退伍军人医院

530
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,070
他的名字突然重新出现在
He suddenly resurfaces on the payroll

531
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:07,280
萨特勒一处老兵机构的工资单上
of the Sawtelle veterans administration,

532
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,260
他在那里当门卫长达42年
where he was employed as a janitor for 42 years.

533
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,850
迪斯独居  与世隔绝
Dease lived alone and isolated,

534
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:19,100
用他的艺术深潜到他的精神世界
using his art to dive deep into his own psyche.

535
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:23,470
这位艺术家与自己的心魔抗争了几十年
The artist battled for decades with his personal demons.

536
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:27,510
以此换来了这暴力与疯狂的史诗
The result is an epic saga of violence and madness.

537
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:31,720
渴求答案的哀嚎  从未到来的解脱
A howl for answers and a resolution that never comes.

538
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:39,640
我前男友瑞奇周五有个展览
My ex-boyfriend, Ricky, has an exhibition Friday.

539
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,220
他是个蠢材
He's a hack.

540
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:45,850
满脸胡须  装腔作势
A bearded, downtown poser.

541
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:53,720
他这辈子连一个他自己的主意都没有
You know, he hasn't had, like, an original idea in his whole life.

542
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:58,550
除此之外  他剽窃别人的作品
On top of which, he steals from everyone.

543
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:00,300
但没关系
But you know that, right?

544
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,850
我非常熟悉他的作品
I'm very familiar with his work.

545
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,260
你应该去看他的展
You should go to his show,

546
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:12,800
亲眼看看他有多糟糕
see for yourself how much he sucks.

547
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,430
-然后做你该做的  -你认真的吗
- Then do what you do. - Are you serious?

548
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,640
为了我
For me.

549
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,600
你好  莫弗
Hello, Morf.

550
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:36,020
好吧
Right.

551
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:36,820
这是当代的吗
Is it contemporary?

552
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,860
它直奔主题  赋予了形式真正的情感
It cuts through the bullshit and gives form to true emotion.

553
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,300
-这想表达什么  -你感受到了什么
- What does it say? - What do you feel?

554
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,430
他们以全新的方式运用科技
They're using tech in a whole new way.

555
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:48,970
主旨在于建立一个包括所有媒介的平台
The idea is aiming for a platform that includes all media.

556
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:53,720
他不知从何而来  孑然一身
He came from nowhere, knew no one,

557
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:57,320
如果不是我们勤劳的约瑟芬娜善于观察
and if our industrious Josephina here hadn't been so observant,

558
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,850
他的杰作就可能被丢掉了
his genius work would've been thrown away.

559
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:03,890
他本可能会被遗忘的
And, um, he would've been consigned to oblivion.

560
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:08,350
借着路灯  我在一个垃圾堆旁发现的
I spotted it by a streetlight over a dumpster.

561
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,070
大约一共有多少作品
Approximately, how many pieces are there?

562
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,320
很不幸
Well, unfortunately,

563
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,110
迪斯先生可一点
Mr. Dease's output was the opposite from

564
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,970
也算不上多产
what one would call prolific.

565
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,990
他也肯定不会有新作品了
And he's certainly not making any more.

566
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:22,070
有一件我们很感兴趣
There's one we're very interested in.

567
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:24,320
顺便说一声  大家都抢破头了
Well, just know demand has people ready to kill.

568
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,490
真亮眼
Fetchin'.

569
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:30,220
在庄严的艺术面前  我忍不住颤抖
Before the sublime, the whole body quivers.

570
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:32,820
以这个价格  你们博物馆没戏了
Well, at these prices, your museum's locked out.

571
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:36,150
我昨天刚离开了  所以我能随便说了
Well, I just yesterday left the museum, so I can speak freely now.

572
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:38,640
-我现在是一位私人买家的顾问  -谁
- I'm an adviser for a private buyer. - Whom?

573
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,970
买了「球体」的那位
Our friend who bought Sphere.

574
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,190
你真幽默呀
Well, how hilarious for you.

575
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,110
以此为前提
In that capacity,

576
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:47,260
我确实为他挑中几件大幅画作
I do have my eye on several of the large-format product for him.

577
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:50,530
销售人员都忙得团团转
Well, the sales staff have been busy beavers.

578
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:52,350
所有作品都预定出去了
Everything's on reserve.

579
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:54,220
也许我们可以付定金
Perhaps we'd pay a premium.

580
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,850
-这也不能改变什么  -那什么有用
- That doesn't butter the biscuit. - Well, what the fuck would?

581
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:59,140
我卖给你两幅迪斯的
I'll sell you two Dease

582
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:02,530
前提是下个月达米什的首展你买三幅他的画
if you buy three pieces at Damrish's opening next month.

583
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,280
万一我的客户对达米什没感觉呢
What if my client doesn't respond to Damrish?

584
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,220
你是顾问  灌输给他
Well, you're the adviser. Advise.

585
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,350
不是吧
Damn.

586
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:56,260
下个月  轮你上场了
Next month, it's your show.

587
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,650
我得走了
I gotta-- I gotta go.

588
00:38:58,650 --> 00:38:59,550
好的
Okay.

589
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:28,800
能看到有实质内容的作品真让人激动
Isn't it exhilarating to see something substantial?

590
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,800
不只是那些搞刺青的名人艺术家
I mean, other than celebrity tattoo artists and

591
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,680
拿气球当绘画工具  我在写关于他的书
balloons for painting tools. I'm writing a book about him.

592
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:38,570
我很讨厌你昨天发表的瑞奇·布莱恩的评论
I just loathed your Ricky Blane review yesterday.

593
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,430
我对他的展览很受启发
I thought his show was inspired.

594
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,570
可能我没看懂吧
Well, I didn't get it, I suppose.

595
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:45,930
我觉得我们看的完全是两个展
I felt that we saw totally different exhibits.

596
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,400
负面的评价总好过
A bad review is better than

597
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,930
消失在平庸之作中  不见天日
sinking into the great glut of anonymity.

598
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,970
-那是玩笑吗  -据我所知不是
- Was that a joke? - Not that I'm aware of.

599
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,190
瑞奇昨天喝醉了  出了车祸
Ricky got drunk and crashed his car last night.

600
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,610
他昏迷了
He's in coma.

601
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:03,260
我听说他都毁了
I heard he was crushed.

602
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,260
因为车祸吗
By the car?

603
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,260
你的评论  王八蛋
Your review. Arschloch.

604
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:21,260
你说什么  布莱森把部分画作搬去了仓库
What do you mean, Bryson's moving some of the art to storage?

605
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,280
如果钻石商一次发售所有钻石
Well, if De Beers released all their diamonds,

606
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,820
那它们就会变得一文不值
they'd be cheap as cut glass.

607
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,030
艺术学校没教过你这些吗
Didn't they teach any of this in art school?

608
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,970
我们要说他有多少作品
How many are we saying he made?

609
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:32,070
它们的价值恰恰在于稀少  所以那不是我们的说辞
Well, their value's their scarcity, so it's not what we say.

610
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:32,780
那是事实
It's the reality.

611
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:36,240
事实是楼上存了一千多幅
The reality is we have over one thousand pieces stored upstairs.

612
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,990
胡说
Well, that's nonsense.

613
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:40,430
我怀疑都不到五百
Why, I doubt if it's even half that number.

614
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,740
你做了什么
What have you done?

615
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,860
让它不参与流通
Removed them from circulation.

616
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:46,260
未雨绸缪
Locking them away for a rainy day.

617
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,350
操
Fuck.

618
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:38,430
操  操
Fuck! Fuck!

619
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,890
操
Fuck!

620
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:53,680
操
Fuck!

621
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,390
{\an8}谦卑

622
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:23,680
该死  该死
shit. shit

623
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,010
该死
Oh shit.

624
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:42,720
有人吗
Hello?

625
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,720
你好啊  我是敦顿
Howzit? It's Dondon.

626
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,970
别激动  孩子  没到时候
- - Easy, boy. Not yet.

627
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:18,890
拜访工作室  我好激动
Studio visit. I'm excited.

628
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:22,610
我受不了乐天派
I can't stomach cheery or upbeat.

629
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:24,780
我不是傻子  记住了
I'm not an idiot. Remember that.

630
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,190
我很荣幸成为你的新经纪人
Hey, I'm honored to be your new representative

631
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,150
-看看你最近在忙什么  -我想也是
- and see what you've been up to. - I just bet you are.

632
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:31,890
奇迹发生的地方就是这里吗
So, this is where the magic happens?

633
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,470
这是个笑话吗
Is that a joke?

634
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:35,550
什么
Sorry?

635
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:39,300
这些是复制品
This is repros and replicas.

636
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,220
工作室在楼上
Studio's upstairs.

637
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:43,010
鲁珀特  上楼
Rupert, up.

638
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:03,050
太壮观了
This is remarkable.

639
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:05,760
那不是作品
It's not art.

640
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:32,550
怎么样
Well?

641
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,350
我...
Well, I...

642
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:38,930
我还在笑话  亲眼看见艺术的产生过程太激动了
I'm just soaking it in. It's thrilling to see a work in progress.

643
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:41,610
痛快点给我个看法  你眼前的画
Just give me an honest goddamn opinion about

644
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:43,100
到底怎么样
what you're looking at.

645
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:47,550
我能看出你作品的特征  所以...
I can see a line with your body of work. So...

646
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,650
我在抄袭自己
So, I'm copying myself?

647
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:51,800
如果是自己的作品  就不算抄袭
It's not copying if it's your canon.

648
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:54,930
我以为你的工作室在城里
I thought your studio was downtown.

649
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,470
太多诱惑了
Too many addiction triggers.

650
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,720
-我去年都在这工作  -我...
- I worked here the last year. - Well, I--

651
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:04,190
我很愿意看看你搬来之后的所有新作品
I'd love to see all the new work you've done since moving,

652
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,240
因为经纪团队都已经准备好
because the team is geared up and ready

653
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,890
卖出你的所有新作了
to sell every new piece you have.

654
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:24,510
好吧
Right.

655
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:27,510
当然了
Sure, of course.

656
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:32,140
不  你在构思
No, you've... you've been gestating.

657
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:35,140
构思预示着新生
Gestation implies birth.

658
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:39,140
灵感迸发  然而随即自我毁灭
Ideas come, but they kill themselves as soon as they appear.

659
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:42,180
这就是个屠宰场
This is a slaughterhouse.

660
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:44,140
欢迎入伙
Welcome aboard.

661
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:56,970
我们接到电话后  花了几天时间找到你们
When we got the call, it took us a few days to locate you.

662
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,600
我们一直很忙
We've been busy.

663
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:01,740
看起来他滑进了加油站的侧面
Now, it looks he slid into the side of a gas station

664
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:04,190
在加州国家森林公园外
out in Angeles National Forest.

665
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,010
这里已经关闭几年了
Place has been closed for years.

666
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:09,550
什么导致了车祸
What caused the crash?

667
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:11,140
不知道
Don't know.

668
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:13,850
也许他撞到头  就走偏了
Think he may have hit his head and wandered off.

669
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,010
这里很容易迷路
It's easy to get lost out there.

670
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,930
有什么发现吗
Was anything recovered?

671
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:21,740
都放在后面了
Well, we put it in the back here.

672
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:25,140
我们认为车子在被发现前可能遭到破坏
We think the vehicle may have been vandalized before we located it.

673
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,320
这附近有个很大的流浪汉聚集地
There's a big homeless camp near there.

674
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,760
他们如果先找到车子  很可能已经洗劫了
They would've cleaned it out if they found it first.

675
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:32,430
你知道车里有什么贵重物品吗
Was there anything of value you know was inside?

676
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,050
不
No.

677
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,390
据我所知没有
Not that I know of.

678
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,680
你们就找到这些
This is all you found?

679
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:40,680
不
No.

680
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:42,470
还有这个
There was this.

681
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,550
他去了哪
Where did he go?

682
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:49,300
作品都去哪了
Where's the art?

683
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:50,900
你为什么一开始要相信他
Why would you trust him in the first place?

684
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,760
我没告诉他箱子里是什么
I didn't tell him what was in the crates.

685
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:56,690
他只需要把箱子运到兰卡斯特的一个库房
All he had to do was deliver them to a warehouse in Lancaster.

686
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,820
这事情要出岔子了  跟你明说
This shit goes sideways, and I'm telling you straight up,

687
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:02,140
我会说这都是你的注意  跟我没关系
I will say this was all your idea. I had nothing to do with it.

688
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,100
这是布莱森的手机  显然我没接电话
This is Bryson's phone. obviously, I didn't pick up.

689
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:13,300
布莱森  是我
Bryson, it's me.

690
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:15,890
你他妈在哪
Where the fuck are you?

691
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,720
你要跟我来硬的  自己卷钱跑吗
You trying to strong-arm me, cash in on your own? What?

692
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,300
别他妈搞我  布莱森  回我电话
Don't fuck with me, Bryson. Call me.

693
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:31,260
我来的时机正好
I came at the right time.

694
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:33,440
不不  现在不是时候
- - No, no. Not now.

695
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:34,640
我有很多事做
I have a lot to do.

696
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,570
又不是要搞三个小时
Wha... It's not for three hours.

697
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:39,260
我准备就要花这么久
It'll take me that long to get ready.

698
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,890
就是个募捐活动
It's just a fundraiser.

699
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:43,350
要拍照的
There's going to be pictures.

700
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,760
我们第一次一起出席  这对我很重要
Our first time out. This is super important to me.

701
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:48,390
我想看上去光鲜动人
I wanna look good.

702
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:50,680
我找到条不错的裙子
I found a sick dress.

703
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:54,140
这个沙发对于天花板的高度来说太小了
This sofa's completely too small for the ceiling height.

704
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:56,260
看上去孤零零的
It swims in here.

705
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:03,260
我在给那本书归档画作
So, I've been cataloging paintings for the book.

706
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:06,300
但有些不对劲
Something doesn't add up.

707
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,260
怎么了
What's that?

708
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:12,930
里面几乎没有研究图和草图  看上去遗失了
There's almost no studies or sketches. They seem to be missing.

709
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:17,470
不同时期之间也有巨大的空隙
As well as large gaps from different periods of his work.

710
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:21,510
他给画作标了日期
He dated them, you know.

711
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:24,240
不  我找到的都在那了
No, everything I found is there.

712
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,140
相信我  如果还有我一定会知道的
Trust me, I'd know.

713
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,100
冰箱里有高档香槟酒
I've got some great champagne in the fridge.

714
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,680
我们一边准备一边喝吧
Open it while we get ready.

715
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,400
{\an8}敦顿画廊

716
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,280
走的时候记得来看看
Stop by before you leave.

717
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:55,390
三点钟方向  招聘档案管理员的面试
Your three o'clock is here. Interview for the archivist opening.

718
00:50:58,530 --> 00:50:59,350
你年纪太小了
You're too young.

719
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:05,350
我22岁了
I'm twenty-two.

720
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:08,300
这个职位需要多年的工作经验
The position requires someone with years of experience.

721
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,260
等你40岁了再来吧
Stop back when you're forty, eh?

722
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:12,350
这就完了
That's it?

723
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:14,640
没错
That is it.

724
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:23,260
你在洛多拉那里干过
You worked for Rhodora?

725
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:29,490
就几周时间
Just for a few weeks.

726
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:32,010
所以我不受非竞争条款的限制
So, the non-compete clause doesn't apply.

727
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,740
-她把你开除了  -我当时在茶歇
- She fired you? - I was on a break.

728
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:35,990
有个男的闯进来和她说了几句话
A man walked in and talked to her,

729
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:37,400
她就揪着这事不放了
and she never let it go.

730
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,890
你也参加了迪斯的开幕画展吗
You were there for the Dease opening?

731
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,550
-乱成了一锅粥  -你知道她赚了多少吗
- It was a zoo. - You know how much she generated?

732
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:45,430
-我看到了那笔数目  -买家名单呢
- I saw the numbers. - The buyers list?

733
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:47,510
每个都知道
Every name.

734
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:50,300
你的客户买了两幅
Your client bought two.

735
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,390
挺机智
Very resourceful.

736
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:56,470
干这行就必须机智
I've learned that you have to be.

737
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:04,720
洛多拉锁住了一份迪斯的档案
Rhodora had, um, a file on Dease that she kept locked away.

738
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:08,430
有天我找到了钥匙...
One day I found the key and...

739
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,050
内容非常吸引人
it was a very interesting read.

740
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,050
我好像确实有个职位空缺
You know what? I might have an opening.

741
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:18,680
进办公室跟我说说你还听到了些什么
Come back to my office and tell me what else you heard.

742
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:36,850
我还真想念这里呢
I do miss it here.

743
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:40,890
同事情谊  目的纯粹

745
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:45,550
还有可以俯瞰沥青坑的咖啡厅
the cafe overlooking the tar pits.

746
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:49,070
说回正事  维特利尔·迪斯
Well, on to Vetril Dease.

747
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:52,650
在宇宙联邦里
In the united federation of the universe,

748
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:56,150
现在应该没有比他更火的画家了
I doubt there is a hotter artist at the moment.

749
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:58,150
你知道吗  自画展开幕以来
Do you know, since the exhibit opening,

750
00:52:58,150 --> 00:52:59,320
他都上了推特热门
he's actually trending on twitter.

751
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,070
我们对展出他的画作很感兴趣
We're interested in showing him.

752
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:02,970
你能提供多少幅
How many pieces are we talking about?

753
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:05,740
我能提供我客户买的两幅
I can supply two owned by my client.

754
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:08,720
另外还能从迷雾画廊租借十幅
And another ten on loan from the Haze Gallery.

755
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:11,530
把尺寸和图片发到群里来
Send dimensions and JPEGs for the group,

756
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:13,760
我们下个季度开展
and we'll aim for a spot next season.

757
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,850
我想马上就展出
I want them exhibited ASAP.

758
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:20,860
在主展厅里建个新侧厅  还要做活动推广
Main hall, new wing. Event marketing.

759
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:22,850
这都是要走流程的  格雷琴
You know we have a process, Gretchen.

760
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,490
我给前雇主想了个绝妙的点子
I had a glorious concept to support my former employer,

761
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:30,860
给所谓的顶尖洛杉矶当代艺术博物馆
and supposed premier contemporary art museum of Los Angeles,

762
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:33,110
率先展览迪斯的机会
with a first showing of a Dease!

763
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:35,740
我们很谢谢你的好意
We appreciate the significance,

764
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:37,610
但是确实位置不够
but there is the issue of space.

765
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:39,910
那就把班尼欧的「马阴茎」
Well, move Banyo's Horse Penis

766
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,740
或者「镶宝石阴道」撤掉
or the Jeweled Vagina.

767
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:44,070
把这两个合体我也管不着
Put one inside the other for all I care.

768
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:44,990
我的客户遇到了税务问题
There is a tax issue,

769
00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:47,400
他想立刻展出他收藏的迪斯画作
and my client wants his Dease exhibited immediately.

770
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:51,400
为了回报我这个慷慨提议
Now, in return for my very generous offer,

771
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,070
明金斯的「球体」也要一同展出
I also want Minkins' Sphere to be shown.

772
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:56,280
拜托  格雷琴  我们这里不是地毯集市
Oh, come on, Gretchen, this isn't a rug bazaar.

773
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,640
这是个能得到答案的方程式
No, it's an equation with a solution at the end.

774
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:00,490
你们要是还不明白的话
And if you can't grasp that,

775
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:03,930
我可以肯定  会有其他博物馆争着要的
there are other museums, I assure you, that will.

776
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:10,300

00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,350
我没看到你
I didn't see you there.

780
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:15,820
我叫莫弗·范德瓦尔特
I'm Morf Vandewalt.

781
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:18,800
我是来调查研究维特利尔·迪斯的
I'm here researching Vetril Dease.

782
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:22,930
-我在写一本关于他的书  -做什么
- I'm... writing a book about him. - What for?

783
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:29,070
他现在是炙手可热的画家
He's... He's become a prominent artist

784
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:30,970
但是非主流派别
in... in the outsider school.

785
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:33,010
你和他共事过吗
Did... Did you work with him?

786
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:35,510
18年
Eighteen years.

787
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,570
您能不能当帮我个大忙
Well, it would be extremely helpful

788
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:40,490
我们约个时间深入聊聊他
if we could arrange a time to talk in depth.

789
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:42,150
我有很多问题想问
You see, I have so many questions,

790
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:44,350
但是知道他的人少之又少
and there's so few people who knew him.

791
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:47,970
你本可以去找那个退伍老兵聊的
There was a vet you could've talked to.

792
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:51,220
他有几枚勋章  还是个大嘴巴
He had a few medals and a loud mouth.

793
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:55,260
很喜欢嘲讽人  尤其是迪斯
Liked to ride people, particularly Dease.

794
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,390
但他最后死在了田里
He wound up dead in a field.

795
00:55:58,820 --> 00:55:59,970
双手被绑着
Hands tied.

796
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:02,720
到现在都没查出凶手
Never found who did it.

797
00:56:05,950 --> 00:56:08,140
你的意思是这是迪斯干的
So, you're saying it was Dease?

798
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:10,390
-我操  -天哪
- Damn it! - Oh! Jesus.

799
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:15,220
我是要你别再管他的事了
I'm saying you left him the fuck alone.

800
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:19,240
我没什么好说的了
Look, I have nothing more to say.

801
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:21,640
你去跟另外那个家伙也说一声
And you can tell that other damn fella that, too.

802
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:22,390
谁

803
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:25,140
昨天来的那个
The one who came by here yesterday.

804
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:27,350
我不知道是谁
I don't know who that would be.

805
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:30,850
给

私家侦探  洛城警局退休警官

Well, we've corroborated Dease's twenty-year incarceration,

808
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:43,430

服完兵役后

813
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:57,430
他遭遇了精神崩溃
he suffered some sort of a breakdown.

814
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,350
在那个时候
At that point,

815
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:03,140
他找到了虐待他的父亲并将其杀害
he tracked down his abusive father and murdered him.

816
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:05,300
但他不是就地杀害的
He didn't kill him right away, tho.

817
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:08,190
而是拖了好几天
He dragged it out for days,

818
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,970
折磨他  最后把他活活烧死

822
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:22,510
注射  电击
Injections, shocks.

823
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:23,970
天知道还有什么行径
God knows what else.

824
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,820
他们就是活体实验品
They were human guinea pigs.

825
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:30,030
迪斯在法院关闭医院之后被释放了
Dease got released when the courts closed it.

826
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:31,400
从那时起他就来到了洛杉矶
From there he goes to LA

827
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:34,720
在老兵之家找了个工作  过着隐居生活
and got a job at the veterans home and lived off the grid.

828
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,470
没有银行账户  汽车和驾照
No bank account, car, license.

829
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,100
连个可用的照片都没有
Couldn't even find a usable photo.

830
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:44,390
你确定这些都经过证实了吗
And you verified all this? You're sure?

831
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:46,050
都核查过了
It all checked out.

832
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:47,720
我说的都是事实
Those are the facts.

833
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:50,030
好吧  我明天就发布这些消息
All right, I'm gonna release this tomorrow.

834
00:57:50,030 --> 00:57:51,570
到时候你得向新闻媒体发言
I'm gonna need you to speak to the press,

835
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:52,940
证明你的资质
attesting to your credentials,

836
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:55,070
还有文件内容的真实性
the authenticity of what's in the file, and...

837
00:57:55,070 --> 00:57:57,590
以及你的这些发现
and the atrocious and disturbing nature

838
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,100
是多么的穷凶极恶  令人不安之类的
of what you found, et cetera, et cetera.

839
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:04,650
我以为这些信息会让他的作品升值
I thought this kind of stuff would raise the value of his work.

840
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:05,680
那不是
Oh, no, no.

841
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,470
这是另一回事了
This is another level.

842
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:11,220
-晚安  -晚安
- Have a good night. - Nighty-night.

843
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:17,600
{\an8}拉斯金斯皮尔和合伙人

844
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,300
我是莫弗  请留言
You've reached Morf. Leave a message.

845
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:27,350
你好啊  莫弗  我是乔恩
Howzit, Morf? It's Jon.

846
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:28,940
请尽快回电
Give me a call back as soon as you can.

847
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:30,190
我想跟你聊聊迪斯的事
I have something regarding Dease.

848
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,140
你应该会很感兴趣
I think might interest you greatly.

849
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:53,470
有人吗
Hello?

850
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:05,930
有人吗
Hello?

851
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,430
搞什么
What the hell?

852
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:40,280
乔恩
Jon?

853
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:07,650
乔恩
Jon?

854
01:02:21,350 --> 01:02:24,140
我们一时半会儿是别想走了
Oh, we are just stuck in here, aren't we?

855
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:28,480
这俗气的管风琴音乐是怎么回事
What is with that cheesy organ music?

856
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:38,130
还有那副棺材  是什么颜色
And that casket. What color is that?

857
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:41,130
雾橙色  他打折买的吗
Smog orange? Did he buy it on sale?

858
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:42,460
小声点说
Not so loud.

859
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:47,360
说真的  想想他要永远都待在那里面
Seriously, imagine having to spend an eternity in that.

860
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:50,240
天啊  你就没有看得顺眼的东西
Jesus. Nothing is ever good enough for you.

861
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:53,630
这是我的工作  我得讲究
Well, it's my job. I'm selective.

862
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:56,190
你这话又是什么意思
What are you even saying?

863
01:02:56,890 --> 01:02:58,450
抛掉我的品味和标准
Toss out taste and standards?

864
01:02:58,790 --> 01:02:59,860
只能低声说出真相吗
Whisper the truth?

865
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,180
那样的世界该有多悲惨
What a tragic world that would be.

866
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:08,240
我是约瑟芬娜
I'm Josephina.

867
01:03:09,050 --> 01:03:11,510
我是洛多拉的同事  画廊合伙人
I work with Rhodora. I'm a partner at the gallery.

868
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:14,740
-你好  我叫达米什  -我当然知道
- Oh, yeah. Damrish. -O h, of course.

869
01:03:15,070 --> 01:03:19,030
-我特别喜欢你的作品  -谢谢
- I am just such a huge fan your work. - Thank you.

870
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,690
迪斯的收藏是我负责的
I do the Dease collection.

871
01:03:22,410 --> 01:03:23,740
你的审美超凡脱俗
It's otherworldly.

872
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:26,440
-谢谢  -因为你的评论让"流浪侠"滞销了
- Thank you. - Your review of Hoboman killed the sale.

873
01:03:26,730 --> 01:03:29,830
它没有受人观赏  而是在仓库里落灰
Instead of being seen, it's gathering dust at a storage facility.

874
01:03:29,950 --> 01:03:31,810
我又不是你的代言人
I am not your mouthpiece.

875
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:43,980
天啊
God.

876
01:03:45,610 --> 01:03:47,340
我们什么事都会争
We competed for everything,

877
01:03:48,290 --> 01:03:51,190
但我真的很厌恶因为这种事来这里
but I absolutely despise being here for this.

878
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:55,070
他是遇到了什么事才会做出这种举动
I mean, what was he facing, to do something like that?

879
01:03:56,730 --> 01:04:00,520
我们上次谈话  他还是不改肤浅的老样子
He was his usual shallow self the last time we spoke.

880
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:04,670
我又开始喝酒了
Started drinking again.

881
01:04:04,670 --> 01:04:06,560
快乐时光又回来了啊
Ooh, happy days.

882
01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:11,850
这个位置是留给亲友的
Um, this here is for family and friends only.

883
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:16,250
乔恩是在我的画廊做起的
Well, Jon started at my gallery, so...

884
01:04:16,470 --> 01:04:18,500
不然我要坐哪里
I mean, where the hell else would I sit?

885
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:23,420
女士们先生们  我们要开始了
Ladies and gentleman, if we may begin.

886
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:30,050
-你是吃了伟哥吗  -我快射了
- Did you take a Viagra or something? - I'm almost there.

887
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,270
等下  换后入
No. I'm going on my back.

888
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:36,620
-别  -我这个姿势不行
- No. - I can't stay like this.

889
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:44,970
睁眼
Open your eyes.

890
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:51,510
我在你下面
I'm down here.

891
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:57,360
我去
Oh, God damn it.

892
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:00,250
有点不对劲
Something's wrong.

893
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:03,560
我们遇到了操蛋问题  说真的
We've got a fucking problem. Literally.

894
01:05:03,730 --> 01:05:05,360
我看到有东西...
I'm seeing things, um...

895
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:07,840
有东西在动
Things moving.

896
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:11,070
真的  我被吓着了
Seriously, I'm really scared.

897
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,330
之前你的热情让我欲火焚身
I was turned on by your passion,

898
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:14,970
你睿智的头脑也是
from listening to your intelligent mind,

899
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:17,120
但你现在却变成了这副鬼样子
and now you've turned into I don't know what.

900
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,250
你的评论也掉价了
Your reviews have fallen off,

901
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:25,330
而且你还是忘不掉艾德  承认吧
and you still have feelings for Ed, admit it.

902
01:05:25,330 --> 01:05:27,100
我心里已经没有艾德了
I do not have feelings for Ed.

903
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:28,110
格雷琴碰到了他
Gretchen ran into him,

904
01:05:28,110 --> 01:05:30,720
他说你们还在商量着要继续走下去
and he said that you two were talking and working it out.

905
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,320
那艾德就是个大骗子
Well, Ed is a big liar,

906
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:33,960
格雷琴是个婊子
and Gretchen is a bitch!

907
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,850
我看了你手机  你打了六通电话
I checked your phone. You made six calls.

908
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:37,850
我们是在沟通他搬出去住的事情
He was moving out, we were coordinating.

909
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:39,930
还有你说我的评论掉价是什么意思
What do you mean, my reviews have fallen off?

910
01:05:40,290 --> 01:05:41,250
你的眼光
Your eye.

911
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:43,900
你的角度  倒也说得通
Your edge. Makes sense.

912
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:47,080
你不知道自己喜欢或者想要什么
You don't know what you like or even want.

913
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:48,970
那我告诉你我到底喜欢什么
I'll tell you what I did like.

914
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:51,040
瑞奇·布莱恩的展
Ricky Blane's show.

915
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:53,230
但你逼我毁了他
But you jammed me to crush him!

916
01:05:53,730 --> 01:05:55,110
别赖我头上
Don't lay that on me.

917
01:05:55,310 --> 01:05:58,300
这又不是你写的第一篇差评  得了吧
Like he was your first bad review. Gimme a break.

918
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:01,620
我没说我怪你
I'm not saying that I blame you.

919
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:03,470
我是说我很后悔
I'm saying that I regret it.

920
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:13,120
我可能是花了太长时间
I think that I've been staring too long

921
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:16,150
研究迪斯的画作和资料
at all this Dease art and all his material.

922
01:06:17,050 --> 01:06:20,560
我过几天去检查视力  会好起来的
I'm... I'm gonna get my vision checked. This will pass.

923
01:06:24,210 --> 01:06:26,110
听听我睿智的想法
Listen to my intelligent mind.

924
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:37,350
怎么样
Well?

925
01:06:37,770 --> 01:06:39,150
无感
I'm not pickled.

926
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:43,950
可能你这只是刚开头  但是...
It's a small step, I suppose, toward something, but

927
01:06:44,110 --> 01:06:45,420
我就实话实说了
let's talk turkey.

928
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,310
你到底在畏惧什么
What are you afraid of?

929
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:51,220
我们是老相识了
We go way, way back.

930
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,290
我给你看样东西
I wanna share with you a little somethin' somethin'.

931
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:08,730
"依赖会扼杀创造力
"Dependency murders creativity.

932
01:07:09,030 --> 01:07:11,840
创造力和未知作伴
Creativity plays with the unknown.

933
01:07:12,810 --> 01:07:17,910
没有任何策略能够封闭漫无边际的
No strategies exist that can enclose the endless realm

934
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:19,680
全新领域
of the new.

935
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:22,340
唯有相信自己
Only trust in yourself

936
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:24,800
才能让你抛下恐惧
can carry you past your fears

937
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:26,970
和已知的世界"
and the already known."

938
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:32,150
这是波利·安娜在1983年写的
That's Polly Anna, 1983.

939
01:07:32,690 --> 01:07:35,760
我在她过量用药后帮她清理公寓时找到的
I found it clearing out her apartment after she OD'd.

940
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:40,600
虽然我很早之前就放弃走画家这条路了
I gave up being an artist a long time ago,

941
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:42,960
但我知道这一行的规则
but I know how this works.

942
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:44,780
先把艺术世界放到一边吧
Forget about the art world.

943
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:48,020
你需要逃离这里  这一切  喘口气
You need to get away from here, from all this. Take a break.

944
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:50,560
你可以住去我的海滨别墅
Use my beach house and stay there

945
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:53,330
等到你只为自己而活时再回来
until you do something for nobody but yourself.

946
01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:01,010
哪个更清晰  一号
Which one's better? One.

947
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:03,260
-还是二号  -二号
- Two. - Two.

948
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:06,220
好  现在呢  一号二号哪个清晰
All right. Two. One. Better, worse, no different?

949
01:08:07,930 --> 01:08:08,770
没区别
No different.

950
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,440
好了
All right. There we go.

951
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:16,120
好的
All right. Well,

952
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:20,650
自上次之后你的视力其实有所提升
your acuity has actually improved since your last prescription.

953
01:08:20,950 --> 01:08:24,320
我希望你能找出问题的原因
I was hoping you'd find something to explain what's happening.

954
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:26,450
那些幻影移动吗
The phantom movements?

955
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:28,590
我觉得我得了邦纳症候群
I think I have Charles Bonnet syndrome.

956
01:08:28,690 --> 01:08:31,000
幻觉  幻象  移动的物体
Hallucinations, visions, moving objects.

957
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,440
你去谷歌了  我就知道
You've been on the Internet. Yeah.

958
01:08:33,730 --> 01:08:35,990
我觉得不太可能  因为你没有其他症状
It's highly doubtful in the absence of other factors.

959
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:39,680
但这周我们再安排一次会诊
But let's make another appointment for this week.

960
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:43,950
我放大了你的瞳孔  所以你得佩戴几小时这个
I dilated your eyes, so you have to wear these for a few hours.

961
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:48,680
这实在是丑爆了
These are heinous.

962
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:00,040
该死
Shit.

963
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:03,480
操
Fuck.

964
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:07,570
喂  哪位
Yes, who is this?

965
01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:10,450
-是我  -真聪明  你隐藏了自己的号码
- It's me. - Oh, how clever. You blocked your number.

966
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:12,410
因为你不接我电话
'Cause you won't answer my calls.

967
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:15,920
鉴于你昨天的那通恶毒留言  你很意外吗
Well, after your vile voice message yesterday, are you surprised?

968
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:16,890
什么  我
Wha-- I--

969
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:22,060
你竟然告诉约瑟芬娜我还和艾德在一起
Telling Josephina I am still with Ed?

970
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:24,890
-所以这是我的错吗  -我们分手了
- Oh! That's my crime? - We broke up.

971
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:27,480
我只是和他商量搬出去的事
I was coordinating with him moving out.

972
01:09:27,870 --> 01:09:30,190
说实话  我期待你会向我道歉
Honestly, I expected an apology.

973
01:09:30,190 --> 01:09:32,750
艾德很明确地说了不止搬家的事
Ed said precisely there was more to it than that.

974
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:34,160
我只是个传话人
I merely passed it on.

975
01:09:36,070 --> 01:09:37,250
你真是个天大的笑话
You're a joke!

976
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:41,110
没有任何信誉可言
You have no credibility in any way!

977
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:42,300
是吗  既然如此
Oh, really? Well, in that case,

978
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:43,940
那我猜你的小伙伴约瑟芬娜
I suppose there's no truth whatsoever

979
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:46,710
围着达米什转悠也不是真的了
in your little friend Josephina sniffing around Damrish,

980
01:09:46,710 --> 01:09:47,560
容我多嘴一句
who, might I add,

981
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:50,430
他俩正准备比翼双飞驶入夕阳呢
are literally about to drive off into the sunset together.

982
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:07,680
姬塔
Gita?

983
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,090
我就是
Yes.

984
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:13,590
-我是莫弗·范德...  -范德瓦尔特
- I'm Morf Vande-- - Vandewalt.

985
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:16,110
-没错  -当然了  我一直看你写的艺评
- Yes. - Of course. I've read you for years.

986
01:10:16,110 --> 01:10:16,990
幸会
Yes.

987
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:20,450
新买的墨镜吗
Are those the new Persols?

988
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:23,300
嗯  没错
Yeah. That's right.

989
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:27,210
那是弗洛伊德的画作
That's a Freud.

990
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:27,210
{\an8}{\pos(305,200)}卢西安·弗洛伊德  英国最伟大的当代表现派画家之一

991
01:10:27,830 --> 01:10:30,000
-没错  -我从没见过这幅
- Yes, it is. - I've never seen that one before.

992
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:32,630
从92年起这幅画就待在箱子中
It's been in a crate since '92.

993
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:34,470
同时这也是它的归宿
And it's going back in one.

994
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:39,600
对了  我喜欢你制作的迪斯展览手册
I loved your exhibit brochure on Dease, by the way.

995
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:41,050
谢谢
Thank you.

996
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:45,050
正如我在电话里所说  我想把手册扩写为一本书
As I said on the phone, I'm expanding it into a book.

997
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:47,180
内容肯定绰绰有余
Well, there's enough there for one.

998
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:51,480
你编目了售前展览的作品
You cataloged the collection presale.

999
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:52,790
没有编目
Oh, not cataloged.

1000
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:57,560
我的工作重心变成了研究迪斯独特的作画方法
My primary focus became Dease's distinctive methodology.

1001
01:10:57,610 --> 01:11:00,560
我花了三周时间研究习俗
I spent three weeks identifying conventions,

1002
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,390
工作流程  作品分类
workflow, classifications.

1003
01:11:02,410 --> 01:11:04,290
几乎无法区分
It was almost impossible to delineate

1004
01:11:04,290 --> 01:11:08,240
作画材料和个人物品
between working materials and personal effects.

1005
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:12,500
说实话  我很高兴完成了
Frankly, I was glad to finish.

1006
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:17,580
我不知道除了我手里的那些作品
Well, I wasn't aware there were any personal effects

1007
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:19,390
还有其他的个人物品
besides the ones in my possession.

1008
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:22,330
不是传统意义上的个人物品
None in a traditional sense.

1009
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:24,440
我是说组织[纸巾]一类的
I mean, as in tissue.

1010
01:11:28,650 --> 01:11:29,520
画纸吗
Paper?

1011
01:11:30,810 --> 01:11:33,370
也许你该和洛多拉谈谈
Perhaps you should speak with Rhodora.

1012
01:11:33,670 --> 01:11:35,120
洛多拉
Rhodora is...

1013
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:37,290
非常支持这本书
backing the book.

1014
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:41,670
不用多说她全力支持我且对我有信心
I have her full support and confidence, of course.

1015
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:50,060
血清那种组织
Tissue as in blood serum.

1016
01:11:50,950 --> 01:11:52,870
我猜是画家自己的血清
The artist's, I assume.

1017
01:11:53,150 --> 01:11:56,490
他用血清调出了黑红色和阴影
He used it to create the reddish blacks and the shadows.

1018
01:11:58,110 --> 01:11:59,670
我们研究的每幅画里都有
It was in every piece we studied.

1019
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:05,850
即使是你  这个要求也太过分了
That is an outrageous request. Even coming from you.

1020
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:09,260
我不懂你们为什么要推迟展出明克斯的作品
I don't get your pushback on a Minkins retrospective here,

1021
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:11,620
不过是在秋季展出他所有的主要作品
in the fall, of all his major works.

1022
01:12:11,630 --> 01:12:13,460
我们已经同意展出「球体」
We already agreed to put up Sphere

1023
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:15,540
来换你的十二幅迪斯画作
in exchange for you bringing us twelve Dease.

1024
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:17,690
说真的  格雷琴  这么做既无礼又愚蠢
Seriously, Gretchen, it's rude and dumb.

1025
01:12:17,690 --> 01:12:20,060
如果你想把你老板手中的藏品
If you wanted to ram more of your collector's hoard

1026
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:22,070
强塞给我们以增加其价值
down our throats to increase their value,

1027
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:24,310
你应该在决定展出迪斯之前就下手
you should have done so before the Dease deal was locked,

1028
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:26,240
而不是在展览的前一天晚上
not the night before the exhibit's open.

1029
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:29,500
我听说市场部很期望做迪斯作品巡回展
I hear marketing has high hopes of a traveling Dease collection.

1030
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,050
他们甚至已经做了个规划
They've even run projections.

1031
01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:35,550
所以我相信我的筹码还是很可观的
So, I believe my "Leverage" looking ahead is considerable.

1032
01:12:36,230 --> 01:12:39,280
秋季绝对没有档期展出明克斯的作品了
There's absolutely no space in the fall to put on a Minkins show.

1033
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,370
明天我要和你们的董事会见面
Well, I'm going to meet with your board tomorrow

1034
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:45,500
建议减少新兴艺术家展览
and suggest a reduction in the emerging artist exhibit.

1035
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:47,660
反正它们也不卖座
They don't sell any tickets anyway.

1036
01:12:48,610 --> 01:12:49,890
想得美
Over my dead body.

1037
01:12:58,990 --> 01:12:59,700
格雷琴
Gretchen?

1038
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:04,440
官宣材料稿件已经整理好
The hard copy PR material's been sorted,

1039
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:06,710
电子工具盒半夜已发出
and the electronic kits get sent at midnight.

1040
01:13:06,710 --> 01:13:07,970
明天早点来
Be here early.

1041
01:13:08,110 --> 01:13:10,710
并提前告诉我到场的任何明星或艺术家
And inform me of any celebrities or art stars.

1042
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:14,060
如果可以的话
Um, if it's all right with you,

1043
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:17,040
我想回家休息几小时
I'd like to go home and get a few hours of sleep?

1044
01:13:17,930 --> 01:13:20,580
「球体」的灯光调整了吗
Has the lighting been corrected on Sphere?

1045
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:23,690
侧灯  是的  我留了侧灯
Oh, the side lights, yes. I had them leave it lit,

1046
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:25,200
这样你离开时就能看见它了
so you could see it when you leave.

1047
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:27,650
那你回去吧
Then run along.

1048
01:13:30,770 --> 01:13:31,520
晚安
Good night.

1049
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:20,850
{\an8}球体的演变

1050
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:48,960
{\an8}选择一个洞探索
也许你找不到
但你能找到

1051
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:15,770
救命
Help!

1052
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:17,160
{\an8}我毛茸茸的动物喜欢被爱抚

1053
01:15:15,770 --> 01:15:16,800
救命
Help!

1054
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:19,050
救命
Help!

1055
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:39,200
喂
Hello.

1056
01:15:41,730 --> 01:15:42,580
不会吧
No.

1057
01:15:44,730 --> 01:15:45,630
什么时候
When?

1058
01:15:46,530 --> 01:15:47,350
今天早上
This morning.

1059
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:51,260
不知怎么地她被卡在了里面
Somehow she got stuck inside of it.

1060
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:57,680
发生了一些故障  然后我猜大概是
There was some kind of malfunction, and I guess it just, like,

1061
01:15:58,450 --> 01:16:01,160
作品把她整个手臂卸了  她因失血过多死亡
completely took her arm off and she bled to death.

1062
01:16:02,430 --> 01:16:03,390
太可怕了
It was horrible.

1063
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:07,280
保安以为尸体是艺术品的新装置
Security guards thought it was part of a new installation,

1064
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:09,400
所以他们开门让人们进去参观了
so they just opened up and let people in.

1065
01:16:11,130 --> 01:16:13,420
昨晚迪斯展览的弹出窗口宣传大获成功
The Dease pop-up announcement was blasted last night,

1066
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:14,910
所以大家都前去参观
so everyone was heading there.

1067
01:16:16,170 --> 01:16:18,680
人们走过她的尸体  仿佛她是展览的一部分
People just walked by like she was part of an exhibit.

1068
01:16:20,530 --> 01:16:22,350
然后来了一群学校的孩子
Then a school tour came along.

1069
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:25,650
孩子们以为地上是假血
The kids thought it was fake blood,

1070
01:16:25,650 --> 01:16:26,930
于是就开始踩着玩
so they just started stepping in it

1071
01:16:26,930 --> 01:16:28,440
并踩得到处都是
and spreading it around and...

1072
01:16:29,630 --> 01:16:31,630
如果不是可可要处理迪斯展览的新闻发布
Who knows how long it would have gone on for

1073
01:16:31,980 --> 01:16:34,730
谁知道这群小孩会玩到什么时候
until Coco came in to do press for the Dease show,

1074
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:38,140
可可看到了格雷琴后直接就奔溃了
and she saw Gretchen and just lost it.

1075
01:16:42,510 --> 01:16:43,630
你还在吗
Are you still there?

1076
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:45,260
洛多拉
Rhodora?

1077
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:47,010
我不明白
I don't understand.

1078
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:51,140
先是布莱森  然后乔恩  现在又是格雷琴
Bryson, then Jon. Now Gretchen.

1079
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,560
到底怎么回事
What the fuck is going on?

1080
01:16:53,970 --> 01:16:54,950
我不知道
I don't know.

1081
01:16:56,450 --> 01:16:58,220
我们昨晚才见过她
I mean, we just saw her last night.

1082
01:17:00,070 --> 01:17:02,610
他们关闭了博物馆的那栋楼  但是
They closed that wing of the museum, but...

1083
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:05,790
我听说迪斯的展览人满为患
I hear the Dease exhibit is mobbed.

1084
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:09,790
走开
Hey. Go.

1085
01:17:09,790 --> 01:17:13,300
我们在朋友圈和照片墙火爆了  上了热搜榜
We're spiking on Moments and Instagram. It's a major hit.

1086
01:17:13,810 --> 01:17:15,330
洛多拉  你还在吗
Rhodora, are you still there?

1087
01:17:15,910 --> 01:17:17,380
你听见我刚说的了吗
Did you hear what I just said?

1088
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:18,610
听见了
Yeah.

1089
01:17:19,390 --> 01:17:21,390
迪斯的展览风生水起
The Dease exhibit is booming.

1090
01:17:25,270 --> 01:17:26,920
有人敲门  我得挂了
There's someone at my door. I gotta go.

1091
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:38,740
你有没有...
Did you...

1092
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:40,710
听说格雷琴的事
hear about Gretchen?

1093
01:17:42,860 --> 01:17:43,700
你听说了吗
Did you?

1094
01:17:45,490 --> 01:17:46,760
我的天
Oh, Jesus.

1095
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:50,100
-你能相信吗  -你得走了
- Can you believe it? - You have to leave.

1096
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:51,880
你不能就这样  这样进来
You just can't, well, just walk in like this!

1097
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:53,530
我现在不想一个人待着
Well, I need to be with someone right now.

1098
01:17:53,530 --> 01:17:55,100
我觉得你也是
I'd think you would, too.

1099
01:17:57,170 --> 01:17:58,190
怎么回事
What's going on?

1100
01:17:59,620 --> 01:18:02,080
你在逗我玩吗
Are you kidding me?

1101
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,200
我们没在约会  之前我就说明白了
We're not together. I was clear.

1102
01:18:06,250 --> 01:18:08,020
你说"暂时分开"
You said, "A break."

1103
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:16,430
我对你作品的景仰之情
The admiration I had for your work

1104
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:20,230
已经完全消失殆尽
has completely evaporated!

1105
01:18:20,510 --> 01:18:23,660
老兄  我可没打算夺你所爱  好吗
Hey, man, I wasn't trying to jump your train, okay?

1106
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:25,240
她说你俩玩完了
She said you two were done.

1107
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:26,980
是吗  是吗
Are we? Are we?

1108
01:18:28,530 --> 01:18:30,570
说我们俩之前没有真情实感
Say we don't share something real.

1109
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,270
我从没有特别着迷你
I was never particularly obsessed.

1110
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:35,890
我们昨天就盼着您来了
We expected you yesterday.

1111
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:39,370
我们闭展半日  期待着您的大驾光临
We closed the exhibit for half a day in anticipation, actually.

1112
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:41,580
我以为艺术网站把时间说的很清楚
I thought Artweb were clear on the timing.

1113
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:44,390
我知道  抱歉  是我的错
I know, I'm sorry. It's my fault.

1114
01:19:44,390 --> 01:19:45,860
我知道这是首展
I know it's pre-debut.

1115
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:48,350
只是我最近有些私事要处理
Just been experiencing some personal matters.

1116
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:51,310
然后  你懂的  今早格雷琴的惨剧
Then, of course, Gretchen this morning.

1117
01:19:51,650 --> 01:19:54,030
-如果现在不是时候...  -不  没关系
- If this isn't a good time... - No, it's fine.

1118
01:19:54,510 --> 01:19:55,440
我早该来了
It's overdue.

1119
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:58,320
我今天就把评论写好并发出
I'll write my review and file it today.

1120
01:19:59,610 --> 01:20:02,970
莉莉斯·范兰迪根用她的革新性
Lillith Vanlandingham is storming the world

1121
01:20:02,970 --> 01:20:05,190
声音展览冲击着世界的耳膜
with her revolutionary sound exhibits.

1122
01:20:05,190 --> 01:20:07,340
去年她获得了白南准艺术中心奖
She won the Nam June Paik Award last year.

1123
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:09,550
她最新的作品叫做「须鲸」
Her latest piece is called Mysticete.

1124
01:20:09,740 --> 01:20:10,820
根据约定
As discussed,

1125
01:20:10,820 --> 01:20:13,490
我们安排让您单独体验展览
we have arranged for you to experience the exhibit alone.

1126
01:20:22,490 --> 01:20:24,400
瞧瞧他站在那
Look at him standing there.

1127
01:20:24,690 --> 01:20:26,580
他只接受自己懂得的艺术
He only embraces what he knows.

1128
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:30,680
毫无疑问是现代艺术历史上最糟糕的展览之一
Undoubtedly one of the worst exhibits of contemporary art history.

1129
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:32,020
一块又一块
Piece for piece,

1130
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:34,650
这是自泰坦尼克号以来浪费钢铁最严重的一次了
it's the biggest waste of steel since the Titanic.

1131
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:36,970
这种令人痛苦的展览就该被连根铲除
This painful exhibit should be bulldozed.

1132
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:40,500
去掉天花乱坠的炒作  他新作就是场无聊盛宴
Remove the spotlight of hype and his latest work is a snoozefest.

1133
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:43,110
不是开玩笑  米纳蒂女士  我在和你说话
Seriously, Ms. Minati, I am talking to you.

1134
01:20:43,450 --> 01:20:47,500
似乎你周围没有人告诉你  停下吧
It seems you have no one around you to say this. Stop it.

1135
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:49,130
放弃吧
Shut up the shed.

1136
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:51,390
这场展览毫无可取之处
There are no redeeming qualities to the show.

1137
01:20:51,390 --> 01:20:52,960
只有难堪  展览唯一的亮点
Nothing but embarrassed-- The best thing about the show

1138
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,420
就是供应了法国桃红葡萄酒
is the French rosé being offered.

1139
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:56,990
这幅作品丑陋得无法直视  还会引起轻微反胃
It's an ugly piece to look at, and faintly nauseating.

1140
01:20:56,990 --> 01:20:59,050
从无知愚蠢升级到...
It's gone from innocent and stupid...

1141
01:20:59,060 --> 01:21:01,030
你这句话我会记恨一辈子
I'll hate you forever for saying that!

1142
01:21:01,030 --> 01:21:04,520
-毫不上心地隐藏  -卑鄙  骗子
- Lazily concealed. - Vile. Deceitful!

1143
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:06,790
骗子
Deceitful!

1144
01:21:07,850 --> 01:21:08,690
莫弗
Morf!

1145
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:11,550
评论也该被评价
Judgment should be judged.

1146
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:15,410
这是一场巨大的失败
It is a monumental failure.

1147
01:21:16,070 --> 01:21:16,840
莫弗
Morf!

1148
01:21:21,150 --> 01:21:23,530
瑞奇·布莱恩是典型的
Ricky Blane is the classic case

1149
01:21:23,530 --> 01:21:26,160
装腔作势引领潮流的冒牌货
of presenting a poser as cutting edge.

1150
01:21:35,780 --> 01:21:38,590
抱歉耽搁了  刚才电脑死机了
Sorry for the delay. Our computer crashed.

1151
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:40,450
我们  我们现在就开始
We're-- We'll start it now.

1152
01:21:41,050 --> 01:21:43,990
那我刚才听到的是什么
What did I just hear?

1153
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:46,830
什么也没放  这是一间隔音房
Nothing. This is a soundproof room.

1154
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:48,810
声...
Voi...

1155
01:21:51,070 --> 01:21:51,990
各种声音
Voices.

1156
01:21:53,050 --> 01:21:54,440
我不知道
I've no idea.

1157
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:58,240
「须鲸」是一场马里亚纳海沟下
Mysticete is a symphony of whale intonation

1158
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:02,540
两万英尺处鲸鱼抑扬顿挫声调相互交融的交响乐
recorded 20,000 feet under the sea in the Mariana Trench.

1159
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:05,530
您准备好了吗
You are up for this?

1160
01:22:22,430 --> 01:22:24,180
我看见了一些东西
I am seeing things.

1161
01:22:25,510 --> 01:22:28,360
听到了不存在的声音
I'm hearing things.

1162
01:22:28,530 --> 01:22:30,370
无法解释的事情
Unexplainable things.

1163
01:22:30,830 --> 01:22:32,400
不可能发生的事情
Impossible things.

1164
01:22:33,710 --> 01:22:35,350
作为现世主义的拥护者
And this is hard to admit

1165
01:22:35,530 --> 01:22:37,730
和坚定鄙夷幼稚迷信的我来说
as an adherent of the here and now

1166
01:22:38,170 --> 01:22:40,700
承认这一点很困难
and a denier of childish belief.

1167
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:45,500
但有离奇至极的事情正在发生
But something truly goddamn strange is going on!

1168
01:22:49,460 --> 01:22:50,860
布莱森到底怎么了
What happened to Bryson?

1169
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:53,060
根据警方调查  他出了车祸
According to the police, he had an accident

1170
01:22:53,060 --> 01:22:54,920
然后神志恍惚走入了沙漠
and he wandered into the desert.

1171
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:56,440
我和警察谈过
I spoke to the police.

1172
01:22:56,630 --> 01:22:57,750
他们有布莱森
They have video surveillance

1173
01:22:57,750 --> 01:22:59,310
失踪当晚的监控录像
of the night that Bryson went missing.

1174
01:22:59,310 --> 01:23:01,700
他的卡车装着满满几箱艺术品
He was loading crates of art into his truck.

1175
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:02,660
好吧
Okay.

1176
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:05,140
那些箱子里是什么
What was in those crates?

1177
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:06,530
与这些事又有什么关系
And all this relates how?

1178
01:23:07,270 --> 01:23:08,230
迪斯
Dease!

1179
01:23:09,770 --> 01:23:11,160
他扭曲的精神状态
His altered mental state,

1180
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:13,620
受尽折磨的灵魂  月亮的阴晴圆缺
tortured soul, phases of the goddamn moon!

1181
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:14,870
我不知道是如何发生的
I don't know how!

1182
01:23:15,350 --> 01:23:16,500
但这些死亡
These deaths.

1183
01:23:16,990 --> 01:23:18,180
失踪
The disappearance.

1184
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:20,440
现在正发生的一切
Everything that is now happening,

1185
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:22,700
都跟他的作品有关
it's all connected to his art.

1186
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:26,810
他的画里有邪灵
Imbued with some spirit...

1187
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:31,370
或是根据某种致命的原型创作
cr... created out of some vital ideal.

1188
01:23:31,370 --> 01:23:33,150
这有点巴洛克  你不觉得吗
It's a bit Baroque, don't you think?

1189
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:35,140
-我是来警告你的  -好吧
- I came here to warn you. - Okay.

1190
01:23:36,030 --> 01:23:39,040
我知道这几周很混乱难熬
You know what? It's been a fucked-up few weeks!

1191
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:40,260
但你听听自己说的疯话
But listen to yourself!

1192
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:42,380
我做调查时找大楼业主聊过
I spoke to the building owners during research.

1193
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:44,940
他们听说
They were surprised

1194
01:23:45,190 --> 01:23:47,280
迪斯的作品在出售  都很惊讶
to hear Dease's art was being sold.

1195
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:48,420
显然
Apparently,

1196
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:53,740
他留下了很明确的遗言  要把作品全销毁
he left explicit instructions that it all be destroyed.

1197
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:57,750
-你想说什么  -别再卖迪斯的作品了
- What are you saying? - Stop selling Dease!

1198
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:00,810
他的藏品能卖八位数
It's an eight-figure collection...

1199
01:24:00,930 --> 01:24:03,840
就因为什么幽灵  你想让我停止出售吗
...and you want me to stop selling over some spirit?

1200
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,730
我在写一篇与这有关的文章
I am writing an article about this.

1201
01:24:06,470 --> 01:24:08,600
关于迪斯  他的过去  他的方法论
About Dease, his past, his methods,

1202
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:10,080
所发生的所有事
everything that has gone down.

1203
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:13,190
-你会毁了自己的事业  -把作品处理掉
- Well, you'll kill your career. - Get rid of it.

1204
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:16,170
都装进盒子里扔掉
Box it all, all of it away.

1205
01:24:18,190 --> 01:24:19,340
我就准备这么做
That's what I'm doing.

1206
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:27,160
所有艺术都是危险的  莫弗
All art is dangerous, Morf.

1207
01:24:30,970 --> 01:24:34,080
首次展出后就有很多人竞相出价
Oh, it's just been a feeding frenzy since the debut.

1208
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:38,770
但经过重新衡量  我们发现
What's changed is we ran new metrics and realized that

1209
01:24:38,770 --> 01:24:41,370
对供货的数量过于谨慎了
we've been overly precious with supply.

1210
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:44,810
我给你发了六张迪斯作品的图片
I sent you six Dease JPEGs,

1211
01:24:44,810 --> 01:24:48,420
都可以立即以报价购买
all available for immediate purchase at the quoted price

1212
01:24:48,780 --> 01:24:52,100
这些作品一定会大幅升值
and destined for significant appreciation.

1213
01:24:54,930 --> 01:24:57,070
全都买下吗  太好了
All of them. Well, that's swell.

1214
01:24:58,480 --> 01:24:59,830
我把相关文件发给你
I'll send the papers.

1215
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:03,130
好的
Okay. Yeah.

1216
01:25:03,770 --> 01:25:05,060
我们在巴塞尔见
I'll see you in Basel.

1217
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:06,460
怎么回事
What's going on?

1218
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:10,100
迪斯的首期销售不是结束了吗  为什么继续出售
We closed the first phase on Dease. Why are we selling more?

1219
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:12,100
莫弗执意要写一篇文章
Morf is hell-bent on writing a story.

1220
01:25:12,970 --> 01:25:15,680
他觉得布莱森的失踪
He's connecting Bryson's disappearance

1221
01:25:15,990 --> 01:25:18,490
乔恩和格雷琴的死  都与迪斯的作品有关
and Jon and Gretchen's deaths to the Dease art.

1222
01:25:18,490 --> 01:25:21,140
他认为那些作品以某种方式引出了某种...
He believes they're somehow channeling some sort of...

1223
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:23,180
邪灵
spirit.

1224
01:25:23,530 --> 01:25:24,580
邪灵
Spirit?

1225
01:25:25,530 --> 01:25:26,970
什么邪灵
What kind of spirit?

1226
01:25:26,970 --> 01:25:28,820
我对这种事又不了解
I don't know the varieties.

1227
01:25:29,490 --> 01:25:31,920
就算他写疯狂的故事又怎样  没人在乎
So he writes some batshit story. Who cares?

1228
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:35,000
我们不是在卖耐用品  而是传播概念
We don't sell durable goods, we peddle perception.

1229
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,340
一戳即破
Thin as a bubble.

1230
01:25:36,930 --> 01:25:37,830
打给你的买家们
Call your buyers,?

1231
01:25:37,830 --> 01:25:40,410
在莫弗发表文章前  尽量多卖出几幅迪斯
sell as much Dease as you can before he posts something.

1232
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:56,660
-下一个是谁  -罗克西在一线
- Who's next? - You have Roxy on one.

1233
01:25:58,440 --> 01:25:59,420
亲爱的
Hey, babe.

1234
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:02,310
你之前说想买几幅有收藏价值的迪斯
Checking back on you wanting some museum-quality Dease.

1235
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:23,600
{\an8}未接来电
约瑟芬娜

1236
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:33,930
宝贝  沙发是生丝的  脚放下来
Baby, that's raw silk. Your shoes.

1237
01:26:35,510 --> 01:26:36,370
把瓶盖打开
Pop this.

1238
01:26:42,330 --> 01:26:43,900
你的手劲真大
You've got strong hands.

1239
01:26:45,830 --> 01:26:47,230
你有没有认真看过这幅画
You ever look at this painting?

1240
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,520
你有发现过异常吗
You ever notice anything about this painting?

1241
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:54,180
只要一直盯着看  画就会动
You look at it long enough and it moves.

1242
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:08,940
这幅画是活的
It's alive.

1243
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:14,460
-我刚把这幅画卖了  -什么  我本来也想买
- I've just sold it. - What? I would have bought it.

1244
01:27:15,460 --> 01:27:16,560
你又买不起
You couldn't afford it.

1245
01:27:17,860 --> 01:27:20,810
我们不想要的  相信我  我这是在帮你
We don't want it. Trust me, I'm doing you a favor.

1246
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:27,270
我得赶去特拉克逊大道
I gotta get down to Traction Avenue.

1247
01:27:27,710 --> 01:27:29,240
-我们不是今晚打算在家里度过吗  -本来是
- I thought we were spending the night in. - Yeah.

1248
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:31,880
但刚发生了些事  我今晚必须去处理
Something just came up, and I gotta take care of it tonight.

1249
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:33,940
你要放我鸽子
You're blowing me off.

1250
01:27:34,630 --> 01:27:35,670
我想要你一起来
I want you to come.

1251
01:27:49,370 --> 01:27:50,780
你为什么一直打给我
Why do you keep calling me?

1252
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:52,020
你还问为什么
Why?

1253
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:53,600
我们分手
We break up,

1254
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,740
你就写一篇文章来彻底毁掉我的生计
and you write an article to completely destroy my livelihood.

1255
01:27:56,830 --> 01:27:59,130
我这么做不是为了报复你
I am not doing this to get back at you.

1256
01:27:59,330 --> 01:28:00,460
是因为迪斯的作品
It's Dease's art.

1257
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:03,220
通过他作品获利的人都有危险
I think any of us who profited from it are in danger.

1258
01:28:03,220 --> 01:28:05,180
所以你就昭告天下吗
So, you just blasted it out there?

1259
01:28:05,740 --> 01:28:07,610
老天  我现在正在读你的文章
Jesus Christ. I am reading it right now.

1260
01:28:07,610 --> 01:28:10,230
你知不知道自己彻底疯了
Are you aware that you've completely lost your mind?

1261
01:28:10,310 --> 01:28:13,830
直到失去后  我们才意识到朋友有多重要
We don't realize the value of friends until they're gone.

1262
01:28:15,710 --> 01:28:17,770
我仍视你为朋友  约瑟芬娜
I still consider you a friend, Josephina.

1263
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:21,340
你去死吧  把我号码删了
Go fuck yourself and lose my number!

1264
01:28:23,470 --> 01:28:25,510
那好吧  再见
Well, fine, then. Bye.

1265
01:28:32,330 --> 01:28:33,050
喂
Hello?

1266
01:28:33,570 --> 01:28:34,930
我是莫弗
It's Morf.

1267
01:28:35,940 --> 01:28:37,950
我计划有变
A timetable is moved up.

1268
01:28:38,610 --> 01:28:41,500
我要存放一些画作  但我马上要离开
I'm storing some art and I'm leaving immediately.

1269
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:43,870
我不在的期间  需要一个兼职助手帮我
I need an assistant part-time here while I'm gone.

1270
01:28:43,870 --> 01:28:47,100
-我有空  -今晚就开工可以吗
- Well, I'm available. - Yeah. Can you start tonight?

1271
01:28:47,870 --> 01:28:49,530
应该可以  没问题
I guess so. Sure.

1272
01:28:49,530 --> 01:28:52,030
我要把我家和储存室的钥匙给你
I need to give you the keys to my house and my storage space.

1273
01:28:52,030 --> 01:28:56,060
穆赫兰大道上有个观景台  刚过卡汉加路口
There's an overlook on Mulholland, right off Cahuenga.

1274
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:58,480
-我知道在哪里  -很好  我在那里等你
- I know the one. - Good. I'll meet you there.

1275
01:29:07,330 --> 01:29:08,430
范德瓦尔特先生  你好
Mr. Vandewalt. Hi.

1276
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,580
那篇文章我发了  可可
I posted it, Coco.

1277
01:29:14,340 --> 01:29:16,410
文章发出去之后  我...
And with this article,?I'm... I'm...

1278
01:29:17,030 --> 01:29:19,830
我等于往自己身上浇汽油  点燃火柴
I'm pouring gas on myself. I'm lighting a match.

1279
01:29:19,830 --> 01:29:21,210
但我别无选择
I don't have a choice.

1280
01:29:22,330 --> 01:29:24,440
我现在知道了
It has been revealed to me

1281
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:28,520
有某种更强大的力量
that there is some sort of larger power...

1282
01:29:30,370 --> 01:29:34,910
某种物质  存在于我们的事业
some entity invested in our endeavor.

1283
01:29:36,630 --> 01:29:37,860
怎么存在
Invested how?

1284
01:29:38,270 --> 01:29:38,940
通过
In...

1285
01:29:40,900 --> 01:29:42,160
违反
the violation

1286
01:29:44,140 --> 01:29:45,750
不可违反的规则
of inviolate rules.

1287
01:29:48,090 --> 01:29:49,440
我是不是疯了
Have I gone mad?

1288
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:52,460
我不认为
Not to me.

1289
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:54,650
我可是发现了两具尸体
I found both bodies.

1290
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:57,150
我睡觉都不敢关灯
I'm sleeping with my lights on.

1291
01:29:57,540 --> 01:30:00,570
除此以外  如果我再不找到稳定工作
On top of which, if I don't land a steady job soon,

1292
01:30:00,570 --> 01:30:02,170
我就得回密歇根老家了
I'm gonna have to go back to Michigan.

1293
01:30:08,710 --> 01:30:10,040
有件事我必须告诉你
I have to tell you something.

1294
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:12,820
什么事
What?

1295
01:30:13,510 --> 01:30:15,440
我之前不是担任过洛多拉的私人助理吗
I was Rhodora's personal assistant, right?

1296
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:18,230
我看过她的支票  我帮她转接电话
I saw her checks, I rolled calls with her.

1297
01:30:18,690 --> 01:30:20,900
她有时好像忘记我也在线上
I think she sometimes forgot when I was on them.

1298
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:21,670
告诉我
Tell me.

1299
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:26,780
你的前男友  艾德
Your ex-boyfriend, Ed, um...

1300
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:28,400
他之前为她工作
he worked for her.

1301
01:30:29,450 --> 01:30:31,680
他帮她健身  他是私教
He worked her out. He's a personal trainer.

1302
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:33,020
不
No.

1303
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:35,070
不  我是指
No, I mean...

1304
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:39,430
洛多拉雇用艾德  让他提前把你的评论告诉她
Rhodora paid Ed to give her advance word on your reviews.

1305
01:30:40,130 --> 01:30:43,280
就是  他会在你发表评论前把你喜欢的作品告诉她
Like, okay... He would tell her what you liked before you posted,

1306
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:45,630
然后她就买下那些作品
and then she'd make buys.

1307
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:53,390
我没被你炒鱿鱼吧
Do I still have the job?

1308
01:30:58,450 --> 01:31:00,350
这是我的储存室的钥匙
Here are the keys to my storage space.

1309
01:31:00,350 --> 01:31:02,510
你把里面所有作品做好详细登记
I need everything itemized that's there.

1310
01:31:02,710 --> 01:31:03,430
好的
Okay.

1311
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:18,870
我的车停在外面安全吗
Is my car safe out there?

1312
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:20,210
我他妈鬼知道
How the fuck should I know?

1313
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:26,120
你去哪了
Where did you go?

1314
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:29,840
这是本  他代理我以前的系列作品
This is Ben. He runs my old artist collective.

1315
01:31:35,770 --> 01:31:37,680
很好  我们可以走了吗
Lovely. Can we go now?

1316
01:31:38,030 --> 01:31:39,090
我要留下来
I'm staying.

1317
01:31:39,590 --> 01:31:41,570
但我不太喜欢这里
But I don't really like this place.

1318
01:31:41,570 --> 01:31:43,260
我是指更长期的打算
Yeah, I'm talking longer timeline.

1319
01:31:43,260 --> 01:31:45,550
我打算离开洛多拉和她的画廊
I'm leaving Rhodora, her gallery.

1320
01:31:46,390 --> 01:31:47,460
你不能离开
No, you're not.

1321
01:31:47,910 --> 01:31:49,390
我没法待在那
I can't be there.

1322
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:52,480
我们准备办一场盛大的展览  你嗑嗨了  走吧
We have a significant show planned. You're high. Come on.

1323
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,050
我是认真的
I'm serious.

1324
01:31:57,920 --> 01:31:59,380
你马上就要获得重大突破
You're about to break big.

1325
01:32:00,410 --> 01:32:02,090
我们会让你名扬世界
We're taking you global.

1326
01:32:02,860 --> 01:32:04,610
你愿意放弃这些吗  为了什么
You'd give that up? For what?

1327
01:32:05,230 --> 01:32:08,300
在可悲的车库里叫卖涂鸦壁画吗
Some sad garage space peddling graffiti murals?

1328
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:11,390
老天  如果没人看到  艺术还有什么意义
Jesus! What's the point of art if nobody sees it?

1329
01:32:30,810 --> 01:32:31,850
操
Fuck!

1330
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:56,950
有辆车挡住了我的车  请过来拖走它
Yeah, there's a car blocking my car. I want it towed.

1331
01:33:58,650 --> 01:34:00,030
我不知道
I don't know.

1332
01:34:01,220 --> 01:34:02,080
稍等
Hang on.

1333
01:34:02,410 --> 01:34:05,320
第七街2057号
Oh, 2057 Seventh Street.

1334
01:34:06,290 --> 01:34:07,270
我在这等着
I'm waiting.

1335
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:21,470

I'm just waiting for a tow truck.

1338

1339
01:37:26,410 --> 01:37:27,840
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

1340
01:37:35,300 --> 01:37:37,200
{\an8}约瑟芬娜  来电

1341
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:39,330

达米什要走
Damrish is leaving.

1343
01:37:42,380 --> 01:37:44,850
他刚才在廉价酒吧跟他以前的代理人见面
He met his old exhibitor in a dive bar

1344
01:37:44,850 --> 01:37:47,150
他说要回去  结束了
and told me he's going back. It's over.

1345
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:49,390
对他来说是好事
Good for him.

1346
01:37:50,180 --> 01:37:52,990
这话是什么意思  你在说什么
What do you mean, good for him? What are you talking about?

1347
01:37:52,990 --> 01:37:54,420
约瑟芬娜
Josephina, are you aware

1348
01:37:54,420 --> 01:37:57,020
你知道迪斯要求把自己作品全部销毁吗
that Dease asked that all his art be destroyed?

1349
01:37:58,060 --> 01:37:59,680
销毁了难道就会有什么不同吗
Would it have changed anything?

1350
01:38:00,430 --> 01:38:02,000
我要是知道了  当初会销毁吗
Would I have destroyed them?

1351
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:03,610
不会
No.

1352
01:38:04,430 --> 01:38:05,640
他是艺术大师
He was a master.

1353
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:24,000
天呐  稍等  约瑟芬娜
Oh, Jesus. Hold on, Josephina.

1354
01:38:24,970 --> 01:38:25,640
斯黛拉
Stella.

1355
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:28,600
斯黛拉  斯黛拉
Stella. Stella.

1356
01:38:28,810 --> 01:38:31,260
斯黛拉  该死
Stella. God damn it.

1357
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:57,460
你感受过被忽视吗
Have you ever felt invisible?

1358
01:39:01,270 --> 01:39:04,180
我曾经建过铁路
Once, I built a railroad.

1359
01:39:24,460 --> 01:39:25,460
洛多拉
Rhodora?

1360
01:39:29,830 --> 01:39:30,720
洛多拉
Rhodora?

1361
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:41,750
过来  斯黛拉  过来
Come on, Stella. Come on. Come on.

1362
01:39:41,750 --> 01:39:42,720
斯黛拉  过来
