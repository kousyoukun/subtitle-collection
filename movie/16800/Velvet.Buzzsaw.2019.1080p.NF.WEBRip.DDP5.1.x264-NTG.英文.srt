20
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,280
There's obviously a mistake.

21
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,860
We were notified the passes would be waiting in our names.

22
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,190
I'm sorry, but that's incorrect.

23
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,100
- Morf Vandewalt, Artweb. - No. It's today...

24
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,600
Hey, Morf.

25
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,440
Okay, I wanna speak to someone in charge, please.

26
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,430
- Lovely to see you again. - This is ridiculous.

27
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,180
We bought Shogrun's Ultraworld last month in New York.

31
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,930
Have you ever felt invisible?

32
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,220
Once, I built a railroad.

33
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,350
- There he is. Morf. - Cloudio.

34
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,530
It's Kenji, you probably know. It's titled Hoboman.

35
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,990
The response is amazing.

36
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,850
Arguably, the hit of the show.

37
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,940
Wolfson, Female Figure, four years ago.

38
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,110
No, it's new. Vastly different themes.

39
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,360
It's an iteration.

40
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,320
No originality. No courage. My opinion.

41
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,860
Well, I absolutely respect the power of your point of view,

42
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,610
but this encompasses on a global scale.

43
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,400
There's just such a sense of now and in your face,

44
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,740
which speaks to pop and cinema and economics.

45
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,490
I mean, you can feel the winds of the apocalypse.

46
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,320
I can't save you.

47
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,490
We have a four-million-dollar hold, a major buyer in Shanghai.

48
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,390
Will you be running your review today?

50
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,610
Do you have a minute?

51
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,280
No, I'm just heading inside now.

52
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,760
- I have to tell you something about Ricky. - What?

53
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,610
- Josephina, he's cheating on you. - Are you serious?

54
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,940
- I saw him with this girl. - When?

55
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,350
Last night at a bar.

56
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,940
- What? - They were both pretty drunk.

57
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,530
- Wha... What time? - I don't know. Ten?

58
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,010
- They were all over each other. - Right at the fucking bar.

59
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,030
- I'm so sorry, Josephina. - Are you sure it was him?

60
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,780
They were standing right next to me.

61
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,570
I gotta go.

62
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,850
- Anything I can do? - No.

63
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,390
Uh, thank you, seriously. Bye.

64
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,100
- Howzit, Morf? - Hello, Jon.

65
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,430
Really something, eh?

66
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,940
Is Piers sleeping with Dorothy?

67
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,220
Oh, I'm certain you'd have to ask him that.

68
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:29,470
Excuse me.

69
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,470
- Morf, love. - Oh, Gretchen.

70
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,620
We bid on it for the museum.

71
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,490
Jon wants three point seven.

72
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,280
Rhodora would never sell a Piers for under five,

73
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,010
so it's a nice opportunity for us.

74
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,100
I'm quite curious to know what you think.

75
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,530
I think sober hasn't been good for him.

76
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,280
Well, this was done fifteen years ago.

77
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,110
Piers was in the full bloom of alcoholism here.

78
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,030
Exactly.

79
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:54,010
So, you're saying it is a good buy for the museum, then?

80
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,220
Excuse me.

81
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,680
Josephina.

82
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,530
Are you okay?

83
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,510
Literally, the worst fucking day.

84
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,190
Ugh, your makeup.

85
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,410
God, I'm late.

86
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,110
They texted, like, twenty times.

87
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,260
I'm headed there, too.

88
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,650
God, fucking people.

89
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,470
- Who? - Everyone.

90
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,970
Is Piers switching galleries?

91
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,900
I answer phones and get coffee.

92
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,010
I'd literally be, like, the last to know.

93
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,550
You're too late. Rhodora already got her coffee.

94
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,640
Are you where you wanna be?

95
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,600
I'm not taking shit from the installer.

96
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,110
What did you think?

97
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,470
I haven't felt that in years.

98
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,470
- Morf is here. - Oh, thank you. Excuse me.

99
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:49,550
Well?

100
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,970
Color. Life.

101
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,720
I love it.

102
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,110
I'm sick of white spaces.

103
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,550
That is so strange.

104
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,690
I've been drawn to a bolder booth presence in terms

105
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,510
of work and palette lately.

106
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,530
This adherence to showing in sterile, monochrome cubes.

107
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,280
It's just laziness. I wanted to get some juxtaposition going.

108
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,900
I'm actually, I mean right now,

109
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,100
writing something exactly about this.

110
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,140
This wasn't in the catalog.

111
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,140
It's Minkins.

112
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,390
It's called Sphere.

113
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:26,650
It creates this unique sensation,

114
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,820
depending on each person

115
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,890
and whatever hole they decide to explore.

116
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,510
Just like life.

117
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,180
It uses all sorts of sensors and gizmos.

118
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,970
It's about choice, desire, sex.

119
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,850
The whole enchilada.

120
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,900
- It's groundbreaking. - Hmm, it's yours to break.

121
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,470
Debuted ten minutes ago.

122
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,100
I'm posting a review. How much is it?

123
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,530
So much easier to talk about money than art.

124
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:53,510
Funny.

125
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,470
Speaking of, is Piers leaving you for Jon Dondon?

126
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,680
I've represented Piers for seventeen years.

127
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,220
That's not an answer.

128
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,350
Well, why don't you put your hand in?

129
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,800
See what you feel.

130
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,530
- It's just not worth my investment. - You're mistaken.

131
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,940
This is gonna be an uncommon event experience,

132
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,650
not to mention the tax incentive.

133
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,070
- Is there water in Miami? - At the bar, sir.

134
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,570
- I don't know. - Fuck.

135
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:30,540
I can guarantee your position as co-chair--

136
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,300
Oh, excuse me. Piers.

137
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,690
I was floating in the ocean, and, for this incredible moment,

138
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,970
it felt like I had tapped into a primal consciousness.

139
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,930
A connection to the world in its purest form.

140
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,070
Ricky's still denying it.

141
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,650
"Please, baby, let me explain."

142
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,490
I swear to God, I want to hurt him.

143
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,890
Maybe it will free you up for new things.

144
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,430
This was a new thing. He'd just moved in.

145
00:07:59,150 --> 00:07:59,940
I have to say,

146
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:04,220
I'm having my own major second thoughts about Ed.

147
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,890
He actually has some fantasy about us getting married.

148
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,600
I'm through dating artists.

149
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,720
They're already in a relationship.

150
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,030
Look, Damrish,

151
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,740
your website doesn't give a sense of scale or texture.

152
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,860
But seeing your work in person at the new-artists fair,

153
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,220
I had that "Oh, my God" moment.

154
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:28,470
It charges and mauls and devours.

155
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:31,190
Six months ago, I was living on the street,

156
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,850
showing on the sidewalk.

157
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,220
So, that's where I'm coming from, right?

158
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,510
Let me fill you in.

159
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,140
All this...

160
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,360
it's just a safari to hunt the next new thing and eat it.

161
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,260
I heard you were the one to watch out for.

162
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,430
I'm easy-peasy.

163
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,850
Pussycat, really.

164
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:50,530
I know all about you, going back to your punk days.

165
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,190
Oof, that was many moons ago.

166
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,440
- Velvet Buzzsaw. - Yeah, well, the name was catchy.

167
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,140
Yeah, the early stuff was great.

168
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,390
Then it became, what? Like, self-parody?

169
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,180
I mean, after Polly left,

170
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,970
why'd you split up?

171
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,820
Who remembers through all the booze and pills.

172
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,300
But the point is,

173
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,850
I've gone from anarchist to purveyor of good taste.

174
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,970
So, I get the joke.

175
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,010
None of this is new. It's all been done since

176
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:20,430
someone charged a bone to see the first cave painting.

177
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,470
Here you are.

178
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,760
So... Thank you.

179
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,800
What cave are you showing in?

180
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,300
Me and my dudes started a collective.

181
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,470
Well, cheers to that.

182
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,260
Well, hell knows, I love loyalty,

183
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,850
but I would kill to exhibit you.

184
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,610
I just turned down an offer for a full show from Jon Dondon.

185
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:46,820
And on and on.

186
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,350
He's inside right now trying to poach Piers.

187
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,680
You know where I am, Damrish?

188
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,600
I'm here doing shots with you.

189
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,050
Club soda. Lime.

190
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,800
The market always tiers up for you, Piers.

191
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,530
Listen, my intolerance for your bullshit is zero.

192
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,180
Lekker, no bullshit.

193
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,940
Look, Rhodora overpriced you.

194
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,860
She's lost it. She's completely out of touch.

195
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,280
I sold Cranial today for three point seven,

196
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,570
exactly what I said I'd get.

197
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,990
If you come with me, our gallery has cutting-edge analytics

198
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,690
to maximize deal flow and global demand.

199
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,490
I am fighting to get back to creation, to revelation,

200
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,940
the billion years of energy sparking through our brain.

201
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:31,070
I'm not jetting around, hawking fucking tickets.

202
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,570
In an attention economy, celebrity is art form.

203
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,110
Do you understand that I only commission new work?

204
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:40,030
Repros, prints, replicas are all marketed under my own brand.

205
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,190
My boet, I'm more than ecstatic

206
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,890
to partner you exclusively on your future work.

207
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:49,260
I hear Rhodora sold Sphere for seven million.

208
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,240
Man, it's a carnival attraction.

209
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,510
It's brilliant.

210
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,350
I never should've quit drinking.

211
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:05,760
Josephina.

212
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,050
Are you going to SLS?

213
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,260
I'm going to a satellite show outside of town.

214
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,050
Well, I'll come.

215
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,650
What's going on with you?

216
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,550
What do you mean?

217
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,240
You're Morf fucking Vandewalt.

218
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,890
What are you doing coming to a grant show with me?

219
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,510
I like being with you.

220
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,970
We have a taste relationship.

221
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,100
Is that tobacco?

222
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,430
Hash oil.

223
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,550
Maybe I'll have one little puff.

224
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,900
Okay, that was the worst show I've seen in years.

225
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,760
And who was that angry guy when we left?

226
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,600
You don't know?

227
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,260
That was Imeldus Vanderhorst. You panned him last year.

228
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,850
Grab two Tito's from the fridge.

229
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,680
You know, you're in much better shape than Ricky.

230
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,760
I... do a lot of Pilates and Peloton.

231
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:17,720
I remember your body.

232
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,140
I remember yours.

233
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,850
Ever since Berlin, I find myself thinking all the time about you.

234
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,970
We were wasted.

235
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,760
I keep telling myself that.

236
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:31,800
Your skin.

237
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:37,050
It's the most beautiful cross between almond and saddle brown.

238
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,220
I make you hard, huh?

239
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,600
You make me confused.

240
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,510
Tough headspace for a critic.

241
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,600
Got back to LA late last night and looked at the numbers.

242
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,760
My God.

243
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,280
Aside from the peachy Minkins sale,

244
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,640
Miami was really not a very great thriving market.

245
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,300
Brass tacks, we didn't move one Rubek.

246
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,650
I know the London office has a hard-on for him,

247
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:26,650
but to my mind,

248
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,650
the last thing we need to waste time

249
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,970
on is trying to flog some pop-art revival.

250
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,800
Pop-art.

251
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,990
Pop-art.

252
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,010
Fuck me.

254
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,490
"Star of the Nova section was

255
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,760
Mertilla Splude's Go-Pro Kindergarten,

256
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:12,970
an inspired disquisition of early-age experience."

257
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,300
Well, get inspired and come join me in the pool.

258
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:24,640
Is he all right?

259
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,890
Call 911.

260
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,940
Who's supposed to be here?

261
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,180
Josephina. She's late... again.

262
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,320
You, Rococo. Take the reception desk.

263
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,050
It's... It's Coco, actually.

264
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,350
Haze Gallery. Can I help you?

265
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,640
Hello?

266
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:07,220
Hang up, right? Yeah, rich people are impatient.

267
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,100
I'm really an artist, you know?

268
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:16,640
I did, um, Bandini's Froot Loop Hippo, you know that?

269
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,470
And I glued on all the Froot Loops.

270
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:20,640
Yeah.

271
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,860
It's at The Broad right now.

272
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,110
Not broad. People confuse it with Broad.

273
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,140
- Broad, brode, yeah. - Right.

274
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,100
But I can get us tickets if you want.

275
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,140
They know me there.

276
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,050
- When did you get back? - Last night.

277
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,510
I have solid confirmation Piers has left you for Jon Dondon.

278
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,190
I'm going to get bored now.

279
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,940
This feels huge to me. Why would he leave?

281
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,100
Why, why why. Why anything?

282
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,280
Maybe I wanted him to leave.

283
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,030
Meanwhile, I'm signing new talent.

284
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,320
Heard you got Damrish. He's fierce.

285
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,900
And this morning, Mertilla Splude.

286
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,430
We are on the same frequency, I swear.

287
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:00,840
Go-Pro Kindergarten's gonna break big.

288
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,350
Your lips, God's ear.

289
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:05,930
Oh, wait. In our world, you are God.

290
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,690
And I'm running late. Gotta go.

291
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,680
Okay.

292
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,140
I'm sorry.

293
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:17,390
Some random guy just, like, died in my building.

294
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,600
I really am so surprised.

295
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,350
Rhodora, I'm not kidding.

296
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,740
A neighbor actually died. I found the body.

297
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,820
Bryson keeps me up to speed on everything

298
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,070
that goes on around here.

299
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,530
Your chronic lateness--

300
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,260
Bryson's pissed because...

301
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:34,070
he came on to me and I shut him down.

302
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,610
He's a flat-out creeper.

303
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:38,570
Well, I can say the interest I had in you has waned.

304
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,740
I thought I was grooming a protégé.

305
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,860
All our long talks about your struggles and grand ambitions.

306
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,860
And then you insult my intelligent mind.

307
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,530
I'm moving you off the front.

308
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:49,940
No client contact

309
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,640
until you raise the quality bar in your performance.

310
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,070
- Morning. - Good morning.

311
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:59,760
Do we have Berlin? Singapore? London? Oh, we do.

312
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,570
So, I have two new favorite artists

313
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:04,010
I am all kinds of happy to tell you about.

314
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,970
I'm from Perlack.

316
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,100
We own the building.

317
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,100
Did you know him?

318
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,430
The guy who died?

319
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,350
Some sorta artist, I guess.

320
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,050
No.

321
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,220
I found his body.

322
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,140
He liked his privacy.

323
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,650
- He had a cat. - It's up there. We'll find it tomorrow.

324
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,350
Jesus, the stuff inside...

325
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,150
And it all gets tossed.

326
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,490
The old man wanted everything thrown away.

327
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,260
No trace, his instructions.

328
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,150
Looks like he started to do it himself,

329
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,260
but he died before he could finish the job.

330
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:08,430
Well, good night.

331
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,350
Hey, kitty, kitty.

332
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,180
Hey, little guy.

333
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,220
So glad you called.

334
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,740
I'd hug, but I'm all sweaty.

335
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,680
Love the jumper. Cornsilk's a great color for you.

336
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,800
Miami was a revelation.

337
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,800
Let me just start with that.

338
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:40,150
I don't know where I am with anything else in my life,

339
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,760
other than that I feel...

340
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,550
good with you.

341
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,680
So much better, and beyond good.

342
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,430
I found something.

343
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,260
That's what I'm saying.

344
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,600
Who did these?

345
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,140
What do you think of them?

346
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,260
They're visionary.

347
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,140
Mesmeric. An absolute incredible...

348
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:46,100
mix of mediums.

349
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,510
I'm ensorcelled.

350
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,800
- Do you think there's a market for it? - Massive.

351
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,180
Beyond.

352
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:02,800
Who represents them?

353
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,140
I do.

354
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,100
I'm dying with suspense.

355
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:11,970
Who is it?

356
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:16,610
Tonight's jackpot is 400 million dollars.

357
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:20,260
To win that jackpot, you must match these five white balls.

358
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,110
The first winning number tonight is 54. That's followed by 32.

359
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:29,550
Up next we have 52. Your next number is 34.

360
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:33,680
Your final white ball for this Friday evening is 25.

361
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,680
If no one matches the five numbers--

362
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:39,220
It just seemed edgier at the Biennale.

363
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,640
Oh, is this the exact lighting?

364
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,720
I think so.

365
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,300
Okay, well, go check the specs.

366
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,640
I run the collective Damrish belongs to.

367
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,350
I didn't think collectives had people in charge.

368
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,720
Doesn't that defeat the whole purpose?

369
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,430
I represent him.

370
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:17,600
Used to.

371
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:21,400
We're building something away from all this commercial bullshit.

372
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,110
It's not just about the fucking money.

373
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:25,650
Stealing Damrish away would end us.

374
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:28,030
Okay. Well, you know what? He's not a child.

375
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,800
It's his choice, not mine.

376
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,850
- You think this is done? - Back the fuck up!

377
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,850
I tried to stop him.

378
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,850
Okay, well, you failed.

379
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,510
Unbelievable.

380
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:49,300
- It will... never happen again. -Go!

381
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,180
Coco! Didn't you tell me you wanted to get a cat?

382
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,050
Can we talk about it later?

383
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,510
Sure.

384
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,300
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

385
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:21,780
What is this? Who is this?

386
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,820
That was under my desk.

387
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,530
I was looking for tape and I saw this.

388
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:27,990
- This is harassment. - Tell me who the artist is.

389
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,240
What the fuck is wrong with you?

390
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,470
I do more than maintenance and packing.

391
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,390
I'm not just a man of primitive skills.

392
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,850
This shit... talks to me.

393
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,990
Hey, you. I heard you were coming by.

394
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:54,680
I'm reviewing your Purlfoy exhibit.

395
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,430
Be kind. Our membership is plummeting.

396
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:58,930
Tell me something.

397
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:02,010
Have you ever heard of an artist named Vetril Dease?

398
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:05,350
- D-e-a-s-e. - No.

399
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,470
Can you check?

400
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,260
No. Not in our records, and we have everyone.

401
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,050
Morf, honey, I, uh...

402
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,470
I need to bend your ear.

403
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:28,600
I am leaving to become an art adviser.

404
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:31,190
I know, I know. I can't say for whom.

405
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,740
But I will be making enough

406
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:35,320
to afford a terribly lovely car and garden.

407
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,930
Oh, hello, Morf.

408
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,140
Hello, Jim.

409
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,900
Look, I came to the museum

410
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,820
because I wanted to change the world through art.

411
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:49,030
But the wealthy vacuum up everything, except crumbs.

412
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,740
The best work is only enjoyed by a tiny few.

413
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,760
And they buy what they're told. So, why not join the party?

414
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,100
It's everywhere, the money question.

415
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,470
In advance of my move, I am...

416
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:03,050
actively looking for purchases for my new client.

417
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:06,100
You might be interested to know

418
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:09,110
that I can provide to you a generous,

419
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,360
untraceable reward for anything

420
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,510
you steer me to in the realm of

421
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:16,800
undervalued, pre-review, perhaps.

422
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,510
I don't do that.

423
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,140
What's your arrangement with Rhodora?

424
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:26,930
None.

425
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:31,130
Then her buys prior to your favorable reviews

426
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,240
are utterly prescient?

427
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,300
This is my life.

428
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:37,430
How I connect with some sort of spirituality at actual present.

429
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,800
Of course.

430
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,140
I assess out of adoration.

431
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,550
I further the realm I analyze.

432
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:45,720
Forgive me, I...

433
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,180
Fuck.

434
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,970
Kisses.

435
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:17,850
What's going on?

436
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:20,260
You tell me.

437
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,600
What are you doing here?

438
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,930
Hell's bells.

439
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,100
Bryson.

440
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,390
- Incredible. - I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

441
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:39,970
Not if you had a gun.

442
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,350
It's none of your business.

443
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,510
Oh, actually it is.

444
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:48,070
You signed a non-compete clause, which, if you read,

445
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,600
you might remember is

446
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:53,220
very much quite a lot broader than that.

447
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,300
Tell me all about Vetril Dease.

448
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,850
His name is the tinsel on the tree.

449
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,930
Don't make me pull some sort of heavy interrogation.

450
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:10,180
Right now, it's just you and me,

451
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:14,350
with all our active friendship and love for each other.

452
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:19,600
Now, how did you get all of these?

453
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,300
A guy upstairs. He died.

454
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,100
And you just took them?

455
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,890
He had no family or friends.

456
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,610
Well, I won't bother with the obvious questions,

457
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:37,550
but, oh, you must have some giant plans.

458
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,760
I invented do-it-yourself.

459
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:43,760
And you're in way over your head, babe.

460
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:48,760
You have to archive and catalog and establish ownership.

461
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:51,890
And monetize.

462
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:58,430
I'm willing to do all of that for... a reasonable percentage.

463
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,510
You can engage me in an endless lawsuit, or...

464
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:06,800
you can become rich and famous and successful.

465
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,890
Which is what we both know you've always wanted.

466
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:26,860
We can claim the property was abandoned

467
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,280
if she says she found it in the dumpster.

468
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,940
And took steps to find a rightful owner.

469
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,820
Well, first reports are he had no heirs.

470
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:34,300
She's just a tenant. Could the building owner make a claim?

471
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,800
The salvage guy said that they were junking everything.

472
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:39,490
I mean, it took hours to carry it all down into my apartment.

473
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:40,490
There was just so much of it.

474
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:44,490
No, you found the art in the trash, not in his apartment.

475
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:45,530
This is very important.

476
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:49,150
Now, remembering back, you found it in the dumpster.

477
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,220
Isn't that what happened?

478
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,220
The dumpster.

479
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,680
Yeah, I remember now.

480
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:13,510
Critique is so limiting and emotionally draining.

481
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:18,430
I've always wanted to do something long-form, beyond opinion.

482
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:23,390
Dip my toe into an exploration of origin and essence.

483
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:26,720
A metamorphosis of spirit into reality.

484
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,140
I've... I've never had the vehicle until now.

485
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,610
An artist toiling in the recesses,

486
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:37,320
discovered in death. I wanna start researching immediately.

487
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,400
Well, there's timing. Meshing with our extensive marketing plans,

488
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,360
which we haven't gotten to yet.

489
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,610
Well, I'm willing to write the exhibit brochure.

490
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,550
That will give immediate weight to the launch.

491
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,320
And in return, I want exclusive rights to a book

492
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,100
and several pieces.

493
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,930
Well, that sounds swell.

494
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:14,640
Hi, Rhodora.

495
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,940
Well, I'm archiving his material,

496
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:21,640
then running spectrums on his paint.

497
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,680
And it's the damnedest thing.

498
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,930
I don't even know how to account for it.

499
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,300
I couldn't hazard a guess.

500
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,390
Haze Gallery, please hold.

501
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,600
Haze Gallery, please hold.

502
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,550
Haze Gallery, please hold.

503
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:42,760
Yes, Josephina's unavailable right now, but I can take a message.

504
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,930
Okay, please hold.

505
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,350
Haze Gallery.

506
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:49,360
Uh, yes. Rhodora is aware of the meeting,

507
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,850
but she's on a call right now.

508
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,440
You're positive it's the same Dease?

509
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,690
- Yeah. - Well, how can you be sure?

510
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,740
I visited the institution. I found his records.

511
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,260
- Dear God. - I wouldn't worry.

512
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,740
The file's so old, there's no backup. I took the only copy.

513
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:09,010
Okay, send it over. And wash your hands of it.

514
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:11,470
- And add a zero to your bill. - Thanks.

515
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:22,050
Vetril Dease first appears in a 1930 Los Angeles census,

516
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,990
living in a low-income home

517
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:26,390
with his father, mother and younger sister.

518
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:30,150
Nine years later, Vetril is listed with his father

520
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:34,180
as the only survivors of a suspicious fire which swept their house.

521
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:38,030
Shortly after the fire, Vetril's named in a court document.

522
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:40,690
Citing cruelty beyond the bounds of humanity,

523
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,940
child protection services remove Vetril from his abusive father

524
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:47,550
and place him in the Good Templars Orphanage in South Vallejo.

525
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:50,390
His time there is a mystery,

526
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:54,220
the only record being his departure at 18.

527
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:57,990
But the real mystery is what follows.

528
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:02,690
Dease disappears for three decades, vanishing like a ghost.

530
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,070
He suddenly resurfaces on the payroll

531
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:07,280
of the Sawtelle veterans administration,

532
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,260
where he was employed as a janitor for 42 years.

533
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,850
Dease lived alone and isolated,

534
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:19,100
using his art to dive deep into his own psyche.

535
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:23,470
The artist battled for decades with his personal demons.

536
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:27,510
The result is an epic saga of violence and madness.

537
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:31,720
A howl for answers and a resolution that never comes.

538
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:39,640
My ex-boyfriend, Ricky, has an exhibition Friday.

539
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,220
He's a hack.

540
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:45,850
A bearded, downtown poser.

541
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:53,720
You know, he hasn't had, like, an original idea in his whole life.

542
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:58,550
On top of which, he steals from everyone.

543
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:00,300
But you know that, right?

544
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,850
I'm very familiar with his work.

545
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,260
You should go to his show,

546
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:12,800
see for yourself how much he sucks.

547
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,430
- Then do what you do. - Are you serious?

548
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,640
For me.

549
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,600
Hello, Morf.

550
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:36,020
Right.

551
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:36,820
Is it contemporary?

552
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,860
It cuts through the bullshit and gives form to true emotion.

553
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,300
- What does it say? - What do you feel?

554
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,430
They're using tech in a whole new way.

555
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:48,970
The idea is aiming for a platform that includes all media.

556
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:53,720
He came from nowhere, knew no one,

557
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:57,320
and if our industrious Josephina here hadn't been so observant,

558
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,850
his genius work would've been thrown away.

559
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:03,890
And, um, he would've been consigned to oblivion.

560
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:08,350
I spotted it by a streetlight over a dumpster.

561
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,070
Approximately, how many pieces are there?

562
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,320
Well, unfortunately,

563
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,110
Mr. Dease's output was the opposite from

564
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,970
what one would call prolific.

565
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,990
And he's certainly not making any more.

566
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:22,070
There's one we're very interested in.

567
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:24,320
Well, just know demand has people ready to kill.

568
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,490
Fetchin'.

569
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:30,220
Before the sublime, the whole body quivers.

570
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:32,820
Well, at these prices, your museum's locked out.

571
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:36,150
Well, I just yesterday left the museum, so I can speak freely now.

572
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:38,640
- I'm an adviser for a private buyer. - Whom?

573
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,970
Our friend who bought Sphere.

574
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,190
Well, how hilarious for you.

575
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,110
In that capacity,

576
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:47,260
I do have my eye on several of the large-format product for him.

577
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:50,530
Well, the sales staff have been busy beavers.

578
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:52,350
Everything's on reserve.

579
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:54,220
Perhaps we'd pay a premium.

580
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,850
- That doesn't butter the biscuit. - Well, what the fuck would?

581
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:59,140
I'll sell you two Dease

582
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:02,530
if you buy three pieces at Damrish's opening next month.

583
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,280
What if my client doesn't respond to Damrish?

584
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,220
Well, you're the adviser. Advise.

585
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,350
Damn.

586
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:56,260
Next month, it's your show.

587
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,650
I gotta-- I gotta go.

588
00:38:58,650 --> 00:38:59,550
Okay.

589
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:28,800
Isn't it exhilarating to see something substantial?

590
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,800
I mean, other than celebrity tattoo artists and

591
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,680
balloons for painting tools. I'm writing a book about him.

592
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:38,570
I just loathed your Ricky Blane review yesterday.

593
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,430
I thought his show was inspired.

594
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,570
Well, I didn't get it, I suppose.

595
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:45,930
I felt that we saw totally different exhibits.

596
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,400
A bad review is better than

597
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,930
sinking into the great glut of anonymity.

598
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,970
- Was that a joke? - Not that I'm aware of.

599
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,190
Ricky got drunk and crashed his car last night.

600
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,610
He's in coma.

601
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:03,260
I heard he was crushed.

602
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,260
By the car?

603
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,260
Your review. Arschloch.

604
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:21,260
What do you mean, Bryson's moving some of the art to storage?

605
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,280
Well, if De Beers released all their diamonds,

606
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,820
they'd be cheap as cut glass.

607
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,030
Didn't they teach any of this in art school?

608
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,970
How many are we saying he made?

609
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:32,070
Well, their value's their scarcity, so it's not what we say.

610
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:32,780
It's the reality.

611
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:36,240
The reality is we have over one thousand pieces stored upstairs.

612
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,990
Well, that's nonsense.

613
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:40,430
Why, I doubt if it's even half that number.

614
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,740
What have you done?

615
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,860
Removed them from circulation.

616
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:46,260
Locking them away for a rainy day.

617
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,350
Fuck.

618
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:38,430
Fuck! Fuck!

619
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,890
Fuck!

620
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:53,680
Fuck!

622
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:23,680
shit. shit

623
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,010
Oh shit.

624
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:42,720
Hello?

625
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,720
Howzit? It's Dondon.

626
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,970
- - Easy, boy. Not yet.

627
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:18,890
Studio visit. I'm excited.

628
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:22,610
I can't stomach cheery or upbeat.

629
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:24,780
I'm not an idiot. Remember that.

630
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,190
Hey, I'm honored to be your new representative

631
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,150
- and see what you've been up to. - I just bet you are.

632
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:31,890
So, this is where the magic happens?

633
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,470
Is that a joke?

634
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:35,550
Sorry?

635
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:39,300
This is repros and replicas.

636
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,220
Studio's upstairs.

637
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:43,010
Rupert, up.

638
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:03,050
This is remarkable.

639
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:05,760
It's not art.

640
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:32,550
Well?

641
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,350
Well, I...

642
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:38,930
I'm just soaking it in. It's thrilling to see a work in progress.

643
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:41,610
Just give me an honest goddamn opinion about

644
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:43,100
what you're looking at.

645
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:47,550
I can see a line with your body of work. So...

646
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,650
So, I'm copying myself?

647
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:51,800
It's not copying if it's your canon.

648
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:54,930
I thought your studio was downtown.

649
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,470
Too many addiction triggers.

650
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,720
- I worked here the last year. - Well, I--

651
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:04,190
I'd love to see all the new work you've done since moving,

652
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,240
because the team is geared up and ready

653
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,890
to sell every new piece you have.

654
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:24,510
Right.

655
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:27,510
Sure, of course.

656
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:32,140
No, you've... you've been gestating.

657
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:35,140
Gestation implies birth.

658
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:39,140
Ideas come, but they kill themselves as soon as they appear.

659
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:42,180
This is a slaughterhouse.

660
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:44,140
Welcome aboard.

661
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:56,970
When we got the call, it took us a few days to locate you.

662
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,600
We've been busy.

663
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:01,740
Now, it looks he slid into the side of a gas station

664
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:04,190
out in Angeles National Forest.

665
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,010
Place has been closed for years.

666
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:09,550
What caused the crash?

667
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:11,140
Don't know.

668
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:13,850
Think he may have hit his head and wandered off.

669
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,010
It's easy to get lost out there.

670
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,930
Was anything recovered?

671
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:21,740
Well, we put it in the back here.

672
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:25,140
We think the vehicle may have been vandalized before we located it.

673
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,320
There's a big homeless camp near there.

674
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,760
They would've cleaned it out if they found it first.

675
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:32,430
Was there anything of value you know was inside?

676
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,050
No.

677
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,390
Not that I know of.

678
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,680
This is all you found?

679
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:40,680
No.

680
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:42,470
There was this.

681
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,550
Where did he go?

682
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:49,300
Where's the art?

683
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:50,900
Why would you trust him in the first place?

684
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,760
I didn't tell him what was in the crates.

685
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:56,690
All he had to do was deliver them to a warehouse in Lancaster.

686
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,820
This shit goes sideways, and I'm telling you straight up,

687
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:02,140
I will say this was all your idea. I had nothing to do with it.

688
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,100
This is Bryson's phone. obviously, I didn't pick up.

689
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:13,300
Bryson, it's me.

690
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:15,890
Where the fuck are you?

691
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,720
You trying to strong-arm me, cash in on your own? What?

692
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,300
Don't fuck with me, Bryson. Call me.

693
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:31,260
I came at the right time.

694
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:33,440
- - No, no. Not now.

695
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:34,640
I have a lot to do.

696
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,570
Wha... It's not for three hours.

697
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:39,260
It'll take me that long to get ready.

698
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,890
It's just a fundraiser.

699
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:43,350
There's going to be pictures.

700
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,760
Our first time out. This is super important to me.

701
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:48,390
I wanna look good.

702
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:50,680
I found a sick dress.

703
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:54,140
This sofa's completely too small for the ceiling height.

704
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:56,260
It swims in here.

705
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:03,260
So, I've been cataloging paintings for the book.

706
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:06,300
Something doesn't add up.

707
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,260
What's that?

708
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:12,930
There's almost no studies or sketches. They seem to be missing.

709
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:17,470
As well as large gaps from different periods of his work.

710
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:21,510
He dated them, you know.

711
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:24,240
No, everything I found is there.

712
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,140
Trust me, I'd know.

713
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,100
I've got some great champagne in the fridge.

714
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,680
Open it while we get ready.

716
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,280
Stop by before you leave.

717
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:55,390
Your three o'clock is here. Interview for the archivist opening.

718
00:50:58,530 --> 00:50:59,350
You're too young.

719
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:05,350
I'm twenty-two.

720
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:08,300
The position requires someone with years of experience.

721
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,260
Stop back when you're forty, eh?

722
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:12,350
That's it?

723
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:14,640
That is it.

724
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:23,260
You worked for Rhodora?

725
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:29,490
Just for a few weeks.

726
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:32,010
So, the non-compete clause doesn't apply.

727
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,740
- She fired you? - I was on a break.

728
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:35,990
A man walked in and talked to her,

729
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:37,400
and she never let it go.

730
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,890
You were there for the Dease opening?

731
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,550
- It was a zoo. - You know how much she generated?

732
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:45,430
- I saw the numbers. - The buyers list?

733
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:47,510
Every name.

734
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:50,300
Your client bought two.

735
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,390
Very resourceful.

736
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:56,470
I've learned that you have to be.

737
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:04,720
Rhodora had, um, a file on Dease that she kept locked away.

738
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:08,430
One day I found the key and...

739
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,050
it was a very interesting read.

740
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,050
You know what? I might have an opening.

741
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:18,680
Come back to my office and tell me what else you heard.

742
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:36,850
I do miss it here.

743
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:40,890
The camaraderie, the purity of purpose,

744
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:42,320
the Tuesday meatloaf,

745
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:45,550
the cafe overlooking the tar pits.

746
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:49,070
Well, on to Vetril Dease.

747
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:52,650
In the united federation of the universe,

748
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:56,150
I doubt there is a hotter artist at the moment.

749
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:58,150
Do you know, since the exhibit opening,

750
00:52:58,150 --> 00:52:59,320
he's actually trending on twitter.

751
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,070
We're interested in showing him.

752
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:02,970
How many pieces are we talking about?

753
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:05,740
I can supply two owned by my client.

754
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:08,720
And another ten on loan from the Haze Gallery.

755
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:11,530
Send dimensions and JPEGs for the group,

756
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:13,760
and we'll aim for a spot next season.

757
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,850
I want them exhibited ASAP.

758
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:20,860
Main hall, new wing. Event marketing.

759
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:22,850
You know we have a process, Gretchen.

760
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,490
I had a glorious concept to support my former employer,

761
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:30,860
and supposed premier contemporary art museum of Los Angeles,

762
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:33,110
with a first showing of a Dease!

763
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:35,740
We appreciate the significance,

764
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:37,610
but there is the issue of space.

765
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:39,910
Well, move Banyo's Horse Penis

766
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,740
or the Jeweled Vagina.

767
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:44,070
Put one inside the other for all I care.

768
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:44,990
There is a tax issue,

769
00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:47,400
and my client wants his Dease exhibited immediately.

770
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:51,400
Now, in return for my very generous offer,

771
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,070
I also want Minkins' Sphere to be shown.

772
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:56,280
Oh, come on, Gretchen, this isn't a rug bazaar.

773
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,640
No, it's an equation with a solution at the end.

774
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:00,490
And if you can't grasp that,

775
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:03,930
there are other museums, I assure you, that will.

776
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:10,300
Kisses.

778
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,220
Sorry.

779
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,350
I didn't see you there.

780
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:15,820
I'm Morf Vandewalt.

781
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:18,800
I'm here researching Vetril Dease.

782
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:22,930
- I'm... writing a book about him. - What for?

783
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:29,070
He's... He's become a prominent artist

784
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:30,970
in... in the outsider school.

785
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:33,010
Did... Did you work with him?

786
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:35,510
Eighteen years.

787
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,570
Well, it would be extremely helpful

788
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:40,490
if we could arrange a time to talk in depth.

789
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:42,150
You see, I have so many questions,

790
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:44,350
and there's so few people who knew him.

791
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:47,970
There was a vet you could've talked to.

792
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:51,220
He had a few medals and a loud mouth.

793
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:55,260
Liked to ride people, particularly Dease.

794
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,390
He wound up dead in a field.

795
00:55:58,820 --> 00:55:59,970
Hands tied.

796
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:02,720
Never found who did it.

797
00:56:05,950 --> 00:56:08,140
So, you're saying it was Dease?

798
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:10,390
- Damn it! - Oh! Jesus.

799
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:15,220
I'm saying you left him the fuck alone.

800
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:19,240
Look, I have nothing more to say.

801
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:21,640
And you can tell that other damn fella that, too.

802
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:22,390
Who?

803
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:25,140
The one who came by here yesterday.

804
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:27,350
I don't know who that would be.

805
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:30,850
Here.

807
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:40,650
Well, we've corroborated Dease's twenty-year incarceration,

808
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:43,430
using court documents, police records,

809
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:44,970
and work history.

810
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:48,850
Dease left the Good Templars Orphanage at 18.

811
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:52,890
He was drafted. Served two years in the army.

812
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,550
And when he got out,

813
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:57,430
he suffered some sort of a breakdown.

814
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,350
At that point,

815
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:03,140
he tracked down his abusive father and murdered him.

816
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:05,300
He didn't kill him right away, tho.

817
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:08,190
He dragged it out for days,

818
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,970
torturing him, then burning him alive.

819
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:14,900
Dease spent two decades in a psychiatric hospital

820
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:16,390
for the criminally insane.

821
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:19,890
The facility used inmates for medical experiments.

822
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:22,510
Injections, shocks.

823
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:23,970
God knows what else.

824
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,820
They were human guinea pigs.

825
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:30,030
Dease got released when the courts closed it.

826
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:31,400
From there he goes to LA

827
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:34,720
and got a job at the veterans home and lived off the grid.

828
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,470
No bank account, car, license.

829
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,100
Couldn't even find a usable photo.

830
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:44,390
And you verified all this? You're sure?

831
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:46,050
It all checked out.

832
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:47,720
Those are the facts.

833
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:50,030
All right, I'm gonna release this tomorrow.

834
00:57:50,030 --> 00:57:51,570
I'm gonna need you to speak to the press,

835
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:52,940
attesting to your credentials,

836
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:55,070
the authenticity of what's in the file, and...

837
00:57:55,070 --> 00:57:57,590
and the atrocious and disturbing nature

838
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,100
of what you found, et cetera, et cetera.

839
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:04,650
I thought this kind of stuff would raise the value of his work.

840
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:05,680
Oh, no, no.

841
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,470
This is another level.

842
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:11,220
- Have a good night. - Nighty-night.

844
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,300
You've reached Morf. Leave a message.

845
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:27,350
Howzit, Morf? It's Jon.

846
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:28,940
Give me a call back as soon as you can.

847
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:30,190
I have something regarding Dease.

848
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,140
I think might interest you greatly.

849
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:53,470
Hello?

850
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:05,930
Hello?

851
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,430
What the hell?

852
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:40,280
Jon?

853
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:07,650
Jon?

854
01:02:21,350 --> 01:02:24,140
Oh, we are just stuck in here, aren't we?

855
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:28,480
What is with that cheesy organ music?

856
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:38,130
And that casket. What color is that?

857
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:41,130
Smog orange? Did he buy it on sale?

858
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:42,460
Not so loud.

859
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:47,360
Seriously, imagine having to spend an eternity in that.

860
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:50,240
Jesus. Nothing is ever good enough for you.

861
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:53,630
Well, it's my job. I'm selective.

862
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:56,190
What are you even saying?

863
01:02:56,890 --> 01:02:58,450
Toss out taste and standards?

864
01:02:58,790 --> 01:02:59,860
Whisper the truth?

865
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,180
What a tragic world that would be.

866
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:08,240
I'm Josephina.

867
01:03:09,050 --> 01:03:11,510
I work with Rhodora. I'm a partner at the gallery.

868
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:14,740
- Oh, yeah. Damrish. -O h, of course.

869
01:03:15,070 --> 01:03:19,030
- I am just such a huge fan your work. - Thank you.

870
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,690
I do the Dease collection.

871
01:03:22,410 --> 01:03:23,740
It's otherworldly.

872
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:26,440
- Thank you. - Your review of Hoboman killed the sale.

873
01:03:26,730 --> 01:03:29,830
Instead of being seen, it's gathering dust at a storage facility.

874
01:03:29,950 --> 01:03:31,810
I am not your mouthpiece.

875
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:43,980
God.

876
01:03:45,610 --> 01:03:47,340
We competed for everything,

877
01:03:48,290 --> 01:03:51,190
but I absolutely despise being here for this.

878
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:55,070
I mean, what was he facing, to do something like that?

879
01:03:56,730 --> 01:04:00,520
He was his usual shallow self the last time we spoke.

880
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:04,670
Started drinking again.

881
01:04:04,670 --> 01:04:06,560
Ooh, happy days.

882
01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:11,850
Um, this here is for family and friends only.

883
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:16,250
Well, Jon started at my gallery, so...

884
01:04:16,470 --> 01:04:18,500
I mean, where the hell else would I sit?

885
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:23,420
Ladies and gentleman, if we may begin.

886
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:30,050
- Did you take a Viagra or something? - I'm almost there.

887
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,270
No. I'm going on my back.

888
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:36,620
- No. - I can't stay like this.

889
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:44,970
Open your eyes.

890
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:51,510
I'm down here.

891
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:57,360
Oh, God damn it.

892
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:00,250
Something's wrong.

893
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:03,560
We've got a fucking problem. Literally.

894
01:05:03,730 --> 01:05:05,360
I'm seeing things, um...

895
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:07,840
Things moving.

896
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:11,070
Seriously, I'm really scared.

897
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,330
I was turned on by your passion,

898
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:14,970
from listening to your intelligent mind,

899
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:17,120
and now you've turned into I don't know what.

900
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,250
Your reviews have fallen off,

901
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:25,330
and you still have feelings for Ed, admit it.

902
01:05:25,330 --> 01:05:27,100
I do not have feelings for Ed.

903
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:28,110
Gretchen ran into him,

904
01:05:28,110 --> 01:05:30,720
and he said that you two were talking and working it out.

905
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,320
Well, Ed is a big liar,

906
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:33,960
and Gretchen is a bitch!

907
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,850
I checked your phone. You made six calls.

908
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:37,850
He was moving out, we were coordinating.

909
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:39,930
What do you mean, my reviews have fallen off?

910
01:05:40,290 --> 01:05:41,250
Your eye.

911
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:43,900
Your edge. Makes sense.

912
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:47,080
You don't know what you like or even want.

913
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:48,970
I'll tell you what I did like.

914
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:51,040
Ricky Blane's show.

915
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:53,230
But you jammed me to crush him!

916
01:05:53,730 --> 01:05:55,110
Don't lay that on me.

917
01:05:55,310 --> 01:05:58,300
Like he was your first bad review. Gimme a break.

918
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:01,620
I'm not saying that I blame you.

919
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:03,470
I'm saying that I regret it.

920
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:13,120
I think that I've been staring too long

921
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:16,150
at all this Dease art and all his material.

922
01:06:17,050 --> 01:06:20,560
I'm... I'm gonna get my vision checked. This will pass.

923
01:06:24,210 --> 01:06:26,110
Listen to my intelligent mind.

924
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:37,350
Well?

925
01:06:37,770 --> 01:06:39,150
I'm not pickled.

926
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:43,950
It's a small step, I suppose, toward something, but

927
01:06:44,110 --> 01:06:45,420
let's talk turkey.

928
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,310
What are you afraid of?

929
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:51,220
We go way, way back.

930
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,290
I wanna share with you a little somethin' somethin'.

931
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:08,730
"Dependency murders creativity.

932
01:07:09,030 --> 01:07:11,840
Creativity plays with the unknown.

933
01:07:12,810 --> 01:07:17,910
No strategies exist that can enclose the endless realm

934
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:19,680
of the new.

935
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:22,340
Only trust in yourself

936
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:24,800
can carry you past your fears

937
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:26,970
and the already known."

938
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:32,150
That's Polly Anna, 1983.

939
01:07:32,690 --> 01:07:35,760
I found it clearing out her apartment after she OD'd.

940
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:40,600
I gave up being an artist a long time ago,

941
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:42,960
but I know how this works.

942
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:44,780
Forget about the art world.

943
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:48,020
You need to get away from here, from all this. Take a break.

944
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:50,560
Use my beach house and stay there

945
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:53,330
until you do something for nobody but yourself.

946
01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:01,010
Which one's better? One.

947
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:03,260
- Two. - Two.

948
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:06,220
All right. Two. One. Better, worse, no different?

949
01:08:07,930 --> 01:08:08,770
No different.

950
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,440
All right. There we go.

951
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:16,120
All right. Well,

952
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:20,650
your acuity has actually improved since your last prescription.

953
01:08:20,950 --> 01:08:24,320
I was hoping you'd find something to explain what's happening.

954
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:26,450
The phantom movements?

955
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:28,590
I think I have Charles Bonnet syndrome.

956
01:08:28,690 --> 01:08:31,000
Hallucinations, visions, moving objects.

957
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,440
You've been on the Internet. Yeah.

958
01:08:33,730 --> 01:08:35,990
It's highly doubtful in the absence of other factors.

959
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:39,680
But let's make another appointment for this week.

960
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:43,950
I dilated your eyes, so you have to wear these for a few hours.

961
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:48,680
These are heinous.

962
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:00,040
Shit.

963
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:03,480
Fuck.

964
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:07,570
Yes, who is this?

965
01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:10,450
- It's me. - Oh, how clever. You blocked your number.

966
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:12,410
'Cause you won't answer my calls.

967
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:15,920
Well, after your vile voice message yesterday, are you surprised?

968
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:16,890
Wha-- I--

969
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:22,060
Telling Josephina I am still with Ed?

970
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:24,890
- Oh! That's my crime? - We broke up.

971
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:27,480
I was coordinating with him moving out.

972
01:09:27,870 --> 01:09:30,190
Honestly, I expected an apology.

973
01:09:30,190 --> 01:09:32,750
Ed said precisely there was more to it than that.

974
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:34,160
I merely passed it on.

975
01:09:36,070 --> 01:09:37,250
You're a joke!

976
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:41,110
You have no credibility in any way!

977
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:42,300
Oh, really? Well, in that case,

978
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:43,940
I suppose there's no truth whatsoever

979
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:46,710
in your little friend Josephina sniffing around Damrish,

980
01:09:46,710 --> 01:09:47,560
who, might I add,

981
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:50,430
are literally about to drive off into the sunset together.

982
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:07,680
Gita?

983
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,090
Yes.

984
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:13,590
- I'm Morf Vande-- - Vandewalt.

985
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:16,110
- Yes. - Of course. I've read you for years.

986
01:10:16,110 --> 01:10:16,990
Yes.

987
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:20,450
Are those the new Persols?

988
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:23,300
Yeah. That's right.

989
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:27,210
That's a Freud.

991
01:10:27,830 --> 01:10:30,000
- Yes, it is. - I've never seen that one before.

992
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:32,630
It's been in a crate since '92.

993
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:34,470
And it's going back in one.

994
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:39,600
I loved your exhibit brochure on Dease, by the way.

995
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:41,050
Thank you.

996
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:45,050
As I said on the phone, I'm expanding it into a book.

997
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:47,180
Well, there's enough there for one.

998
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:51,480
You cataloged the collection presale.

999
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:52,790
Oh, not cataloged.

1000
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:57,560
My primary focus became Dease's distinctive methodology.

1001
01:10:57,610 --> 01:11:00,560
I spent three weeks identifying conventions,

1002
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,390
workflow, classifications.

1003
01:11:02,410 --> 01:11:04,290
It was almost impossible to delineate

1004
01:11:04,290 --> 01:11:08,240
between working materials and personal effects.

1005
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:12,500
Frankly, I was glad to finish.

1006
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:17,580
Well, I wasn't aware there were any personal effects

1007
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:19,390
besides the ones in my possession.

1008
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:22,330
None in a traditional sense.

1009
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:24,440
I mean, as in tissue.

1010
01:11:28,650 --> 01:11:29,520
Paper?

1011
01:11:30,810 --> 01:11:33,370
Perhaps you should speak with Rhodora.

1012
01:11:33,670 --> 01:11:35,120
Rhodora is...

1013
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:37,290
backing the book.

1014
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:41,670
I have her full support and confidence, of course.

1015
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:50,060
Tissue as in blood serum.

1016
01:11:50,950 --> 01:11:52,870
The artist's, I assume.

1017
01:11:53,150 --> 01:11:56,490
He used it to create the reddish blacks and the shadows.

1018
01:11:58,110 --> 01:11:59,670
It was in every piece we studied.

1019
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:05,850
That is an outrageous request. Even coming from you.

1020
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:09,260
I don't get your pushback on a Minkins retrospective here,

1021
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:11,620
in the fall, of all his major works.

1022
01:12:11,630 --> 01:12:13,460
We already agreed to put up Sphere

1023
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:15,540
in exchange for you bringing us twelve Dease.

1024
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:17,690
Seriously, Gretchen, it's rude and dumb.

1025
01:12:17,690 --> 01:12:20,060
If you wanted to ram more of your collector's hoard

1026
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:22,070
down our throats to increase their value,

1027
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:24,310
you should have done so before the Dease deal was locked,

1028
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:26,240
not the night before the exhibit's open.

1029
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:29,500
I hear marketing has high hopes of a traveling Dease collection.

1030
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,050
They've even run projections.

1031
01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:35,550
So, I believe my "Leverage" looking ahead is considerable.

1032
01:12:36,230 --> 01:12:39,280
There's absolutely no space in the fall to put on a Minkins show.

1033
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,370
Well, I'm going to meet with your board tomorrow

1034
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:45,500
and suggest a reduction in the emerging artist exhibit.

1035
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:47,660
They don't sell any tickets anyway.

1036
01:12:48,610 --> 01:12:49,890
Over my dead body.

1037
01:12:58,990 --> 01:12:59,700
Gretchen?

1038
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:04,440
The hard copy PR material's been sorted,

1039
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:06,710
and the electronic kits get sent at midnight.

1040
01:13:06,710 --> 01:13:07,970
Be here early.

1041
01:13:08,110 --> 01:13:10,710
And inform me of any celebrities or art stars.

1042
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:14,060
Um, if it's all right with you,

1043
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:17,040
I'd like to go home and get a few hours of sleep?

1044
01:13:17,930 --> 01:13:20,580
Has the lighting been corrected on Sphere?

1045
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:23,690
Oh, the side lights, yes. I had them leave it lit,

1046
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:25,200
so you could see it when you leave.

1047
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:27,650
Then run along.

1048
01:13:30,770 --> 01:13:31,520
Good night.

1051
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:15,770
Help!

1053
01:15:15,770 --> 01:15:16,800
Help!

1054
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:19,050
Help!

1055
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:39,200
Hello.

1056
01:15:41,730 --> 01:15:42,580
No.

1057
01:15:44,730 --> 01:15:45,630
When?

1058
01:15:46,530 --> 01:15:47,350
This morning.

1059
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:51,260
Somehow she got stuck inside of it.

1060
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:57,680
There was some kind of malfunction, and I guess it just, like,

1061
01:15:58,450 --> 01:16:01,160
completely took her arm off and she bled to death.

1062
01:16:02,430 --> 01:16:03,390
It was horrible.

1063
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:07,280
Security guards thought it was part of a new installation,

1064
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:09,400
so they just opened up and let people in.

1065
01:16:11,130 --> 01:16:13,420
The Dease pop-up announcement was blasted last night,

1066
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:14,910
so everyone was heading there.

1067
01:16:16,170 --> 01:16:18,680
People just walked by like she was part of an exhibit.

1068
01:16:20,530 --> 01:16:22,350
Then a school tour came along.

1069
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:25,650
The kids thought it was fake blood,

1070
01:16:25,650 --> 01:16:26,930
so they just started stepping in it

1071
01:16:26,930 --> 01:16:28,440
and spreading it around and...

1072
01:16:29,630 --> 01:16:31,630
Who knows how long it would have gone on for

1073
01:16:31,980 --> 01:16:34,730
until Coco came in to do press for the Dease show,

1074
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:38,140
and she saw Gretchen and just lost it.

1075
01:16:42,510 --> 01:16:43,630
Are you still there?

1076
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:45,260
Rhodora?

1077
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:47,010
I don't understand.

1078
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:51,140
Bryson, then Jon. Now Gretchen.

1079
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,560
What the fuck is going on?

1080
01:16:53,970 --> 01:16:54,950
I don't know.

1081
01:16:56,450 --> 01:16:58,220
I mean, we just saw her last night.

1082
01:17:00,070 --> 01:17:02,610
They closed that wing of the museum, but...

1083
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:05,790
I hear the Dease exhibit is mobbed.

1084
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:09,790
Hey. Go.

1085
01:17:09,790 --> 01:17:13,300
We're spiking on Moments and Instagram. It's a major hit.

1086
01:17:13,810 --> 01:17:15,330
Rhodora, are you still there?

1087
01:17:15,910 --> 01:17:17,380
Did you hear what I just said?

1088
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:18,610
Yeah.

1089
01:17:19,390 --> 01:17:21,390
The Dease exhibit is booming.

1090
01:17:25,270 --> 01:17:26,920
There's someone at my door. I gotta go.

1091
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:38,740
Did you...

1092
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:40,710
hear about Gretchen?

1093
01:17:42,860 --> 01:17:43,700
Did you?

1094
01:17:45,490 --> 01:17:46,760
Oh, Jesus.

1095
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:50,100
- Can you believe it? - You have to leave.

1096
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:51,880
You just can't, well, just walk in like this!

1097
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:53,530
Well, I need to be with someone right now.

1098
01:17:53,530 --> 01:17:55,100
I'd think you would, too.

1099
01:17:57,170 --> 01:17:58,190
What's going on?

1100
01:17:59,620 --> 01:18:02,080
Are you kidding me?

1101
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,200
We're not together. I was clear.

1102
01:18:06,250 --> 01:18:08,020
You said, "A break."

1103
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:16,430
The admiration I had for your work

1104
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:20,230
has completely evaporated!

1105
01:18:20,510 --> 01:18:23,660
Hey, man, I wasn't trying to jump your train, okay?

1106
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:25,240
She said you two were done.

1107
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:26,980
Are we? Are we?

1108
01:18:28,530 --> 01:18:30,570
Say we don't share something real.

1109
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,270
I was never particularly obsessed.

1110
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:35,890
We expected you yesterday.

1111
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:39,370
We closed the exhibit for half a day in anticipation, actually.

1112
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:41,580
I thought Artweb were clear on the timing.

1113
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:44,390
I know, I'm sorry. It's my fault.

1114
01:19:44,390 --> 01:19:45,860
I know it's pre-debut.

1115
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:48,350
Just been experiencing some personal matters.

1116
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:51,310
Then, of course, Gretchen this morning.

1117
01:19:51,650 --> 01:19:54,030
- If this isn't a good time... - No, it's fine.

1118
01:19:54,510 --> 01:19:55,440
It's overdue.

1119
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:58,320
I'll write my review and file it today.

1120
01:19:59,610 --> 01:20:02,970
Lillith Vanlandingham is storming the world

1121
01:20:02,970 --> 01:20:05,190
with her revolutionary sound exhibits.

1122
01:20:05,190 --> 01:20:07,340
She won the Nam June Paik Award last year.

1123
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:09,550
Her latest piece is called Mysticete.

1124
01:20:09,740 --> 01:20:10,820
As discussed,

1125
01:20:10,820 --> 01:20:13,490
we have arranged for you to experience the exhibit alone.

1126
01:20:22,490 --> 01:20:24,400
Look at him standing there.

1127
01:20:24,690 --> 01:20:26,580
He only embraces what he knows.

1128
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:30,680
Undoubtedly one of the worst exhibits of contemporary art history.

1129
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:32,020
Piece for piece,

1130
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:34,650
it's the biggest waste of steel since the Titanic.

1131
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:36,970
This painful exhibit should be bulldozed.

1132
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:40,500
Remove the spotlight of hype and his latest work is a snoozefest.

1133
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:43,110
Seriously, Ms. Minati, I am talking to you.

1134
01:20:43,450 --> 01:20:47,500
It seems you have no one around you to say this. Stop it.

1135
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:49,130
Shut up the shed.

1136
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:51,390
There are no redeeming qualities to the show.

1137
01:20:51,390 --> 01:20:52,960
Nothing but embarrassed-- The best thing about the show

1138
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,420
is the French rosé being offered.

1139
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:56,990
It's an ugly piece to look at, and faintly nauseating.

1140
01:20:56,990 --> 01:20:59,050
It's gone from innocent and stupid...

1141
01:20:59,060 --> 01:21:01,030
I'll hate you forever for saying that!

1142
01:21:01,030 --> 01:21:04,520
- Lazily concealed. - Vile. Deceitful!

1143
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:06,790
Deceitful!

1144
01:21:07,850 --> 01:21:08,690
Morf!

1145
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:11,550
Judgment should be judged.

1146
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:15,410
It is a monumental failure.

1147
01:21:16,070 --> 01:21:16,840
Morf!

1148
01:21:21,150 --> 01:21:23,530
Ricky Blane is the classic case

1149
01:21:23,530 --> 01:21:26,160
of presenting a poser as cutting edge.

1150
01:21:35,780 --> 01:21:38,590
Sorry for the delay. Our computer crashed.

1151
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:40,450
We're-- We'll start it now.

1152
01:21:41,050 --> 01:21:43,990
What did I just hear?

1153
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:46,830
Nothing. This is a soundproof room.

1154
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:48,810
Voi...

1155
01:21:51,070 --> 01:21:51,990
Voices.

1156
01:21:53,050 --> 01:21:54,440
I've no idea.

1157
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:58,240
Mysticete is a symphony of whale intonation

1158
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:02,540
recorded 20,000 feet under the sea in the Mariana Trench.

1159
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:05,530
You are up for this?

1160
01:22:22,430 --> 01:22:24,180
I am seeing things.

1161
01:22:25,510 --> 01:22:28,360
I'm hearing things.

1162
01:22:28,530 --> 01:22:30,370
Unexplainable things.

1163
01:22:30,830 --> 01:22:32,400
Impossible things.

1164
01:22:33,710 --> 01:22:35,350
And this is hard to admit

1165
01:22:35,530 --> 01:22:37,730
as an adherent of the here and now

1166
01:22:38,170 --> 01:22:40,700
and a denier of childish belief.

1167
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:45,500
But something truly goddamn strange is going on!

1168
01:22:49,460 --> 01:22:50,860
What happened to Bryson?

1169
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:53,060
According to the police, he had an accident

1170
01:22:53,060 --> 01:22:54,920
and he wandered into the desert.

1171
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:56,440
I spoke to the police.

1172
01:22:56,630 --> 01:22:57,750
They have video surveillance

1173
01:22:57,750 --> 01:22:59,310
of the night that Bryson went missing.

1174
01:22:59,310 --> 01:23:01,700
He was loading crates of art into his truck.

1175
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:02,660
Okay.

1176
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:05,140
What was in those crates?

1177
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:06,530
And all this relates how?

1178
01:23:07,270 --> 01:23:08,230
Dease!

1179
01:23:09,770 --> 01:23:11,160
His altered mental state,

1180
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:13,620
tortured soul, phases of the goddamn moon!

1181
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:14,870
I don't know how!

1182
01:23:15,350 --> 01:23:16,500
These deaths.

1183
01:23:16,990 --> 01:23:18,180
The disappearance.

1184
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:20,440
Everything that is now happening,

1185
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:22,700
it's all connected to his art.

1186
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:26,810
Imbued with some spirit...

1187
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:31,370
cr... created out of some vital ideal.

1188
01:23:31,370 --> 01:23:33,150
It's a bit Baroque, don't you think?

1189
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:35,140
- I came here to warn you. - Okay.

1190
01:23:36,030 --> 01:23:39,040
You know what? It's been a fucked-up few weeks!

1191
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:40,260
But listen to yourself!

1192
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:42,380
I spoke to the building owners during research.

1193
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:44,940
They were surprised

1194
01:23:45,190 --> 01:23:47,280
to hear Dease's art was being sold.

1195
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:48,420
Apparently,

1196
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:53,740
he left explicit instructions that it all be destroyed.

1197
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:57,750
- What are you saying? - Stop selling Dease!

1198
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:00,810
It's an eight-figure collection...

1199
01:24:00,930 --> 01:24:03,840
...and you want me to stop selling over some spirit?

1200
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,730
I am writing an article about this.

1201
01:24:06,470 --> 01:24:08,600
About Dease, his past, his methods,

1202
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:10,080
everything that has gone down.

1203
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:13,190
- Well, you'll kill your career. - Get rid of it.

1204
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:16,170
Box it all, all of it away.

1205
01:24:18,190 --> 01:24:19,340
That's what I'm doing.

1206
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:27,160
All art is dangerous, Morf.

1207
01:24:30,970 --> 01:24:34,080
Oh, it's just been a feeding frenzy since the debut.

1208
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:38,770
What's changed is we ran new metrics and realized that

1209
01:24:38,770 --> 01:24:41,370
we've been overly precious with supply.

1210
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:44,810
I sent you six Dease JPEGs,

1211
01:24:44,810 --> 01:24:48,420
all available for immediate purchase at the quoted price

1212
01:24:48,780 --> 01:24:52,100
and destined for significant appreciation.

1213
01:24:54,930 --> 01:24:57,070
All of them. Well, that's swell.

1214
01:24:58,480 --> 01:24:59,830
I'll send the papers.

1215
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:03,130
Okay. Yeah.

1216
01:25:03,770 --> 01:25:05,060
I'll see you in Basel.

1217
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:06,460
What's going on?

1218
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:10,100
We closed the first phase on Dease. Why are we selling more?

1219
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:12,100
Morf is hell-bent on writing a story.

1220
01:25:12,970 --> 01:25:15,680
He's connecting Bryson's disappearance

1221
01:25:15,990 --> 01:25:18,490
and Jon and Gretchen's deaths to the Dease art.

1222
01:25:18,490 --> 01:25:21,140
He believes they're somehow channeling some sort of...

1223
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:23,180
spirit.

1224
01:25:23,530 --> 01:25:24,580
Spirit?

1225
01:25:25,530 --> 01:25:26,970
What kind of spirit?

1226
01:25:26,970 --> 01:25:28,820
I don't know the varieties.

1227
01:25:29,490 --> 01:25:31,920
So he writes some batshit story. Who cares?

1228
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:35,000
We don't sell durable goods, we peddle perception.

1229
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,340
Thin as a bubble.

1230
01:25:36,930 --> 01:25:37,830
Call your buyers,?

1231
01:25:37,830 --> 01:25:40,410
sell as much Dease as you can before he posts something.

1232
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:56,660
- Who's next? - You have Roxy on one.

1233
01:25:58,440 --> 01:25:59,420
Hey, babe.

1234
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:02,310
Checking back on you wanting some museum-quality Dease.

1236
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:33,930
Baby, that's raw silk. Your shoes.

1237
01:26:35,510 --> 01:26:36,370
Pop this.

1238
01:26:42,330 --> 01:26:43,900
You've got strong hands.

1239
01:26:45,830 --> 01:26:47,230
You ever look at this painting?

1240
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,520
You ever notice anything about this painting?

1241
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:54,180
You look at it long enough and it moves.

1242
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:08,940
It's alive.

1243
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:14,460
- I've just sold it. - What? I would have bought it.

1244
01:27:15,460 --> 01:27:16,560
You couldn't afford it.

1245
01:27:17,860 --> 01:27:20,810
We don't want it. Trust me, I'm doing you a favor.

1246
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:27,270
I gotta get down to Traction Avenue.

1247
01:27:27,710 --> 01:27:29,240
- I thought we were spending the night in. - Yeah.

1248
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:31,880
Something just came up, and I gotta take care of it tonight.

1249
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:33,940
You're blowing me off.

1250
01:27:34,630 --> 01:27:35,670
I want you to come.

1251
01:27:49,370 --> 01:27:50,780
Why do you keep calling me?

1252
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:52,020
Why?

1253
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:53,600
We break up,

1254
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,740
and you write an article to completely destroy my livelihood.

1255
01:27:56,830 --> 01:27:59,130
I am not doing this to get back at you.

1256
01:27:59,330 --> 01:28:00,460
It's Dease's art.

1257
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:03,220
I think any of us who profited from it are in danger.

1258
01:28:03,220 --> 01:28:05,180
So, you just blasted it out there?

1259
01:28:05,740 --> 01:28:07,610
Jesus Christ. I am reading it right now.

1260
01:28:07,610 --> 01:28:10,230
Are you aware that you've completely lost your mind?

1261
01:28:10,310 --> 01:28:13,830
We don't realize the value of friends until they're gone.

1262
01:28:15,710 --> 01:28:17,770
I still consider you a friend, Josephina.

1263
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:21,340
Go fuck yourself and lose my number!

1264
01:28:23,470 --> 01:28:25,510
Well, fine, then. Bye.

1265
01:28:32,330 --> 01:28:33,050
Hello?

1266
01:28:33,570 --> 01:28:34,930
It's Morf.

1267
01:28:35,940 --> 01:28:37,950
A timetable is moved up.

1268
01:28:38,610 --> 01:28:41,500
I'm storing some art and I'm leaving immediately.

1269
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:43,870
I need an assistant part-time here while I'm gone.

1270
01:28:43,870 --> 01:28:47,100
- Well, I'm available. - Yeah. Can you start tonight?

1271
01:28:47,870 --> 01:28:49,530
I guess so. Sure.

1272
01:28:49,530 --> 01:28:52,030
I need to give you the keys to my house and my storage space.

1273
01:28:52,030 --> 01:28:56,060
There's an overlook on Mulholland, right off Cahuenga.

1274
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:58,480
- I know the one. - Good. I'll meet you there.

1275
01:29:07,330 --> 01:29:08,430
Mr. Vandewalt. Hi.

1276
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,580
I posted it, Coco.

1277
01:29:14,340 --> 01:29:16,410
And with this article,?I'm... I'm...

1278
01:29:17,030 --> 01:29:19,830
I'm pouring gas on myself. I'm lighting a match.

1279
01:29:19,830 --> 01:29:21,210
I don't have a choice.

1280
01:29:22,330 --> 01:29:24,440
It has been revealed to me

1281
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:28,520
that there is some sort of larger power...

1282
01:29:30,370 --> 01:29:34,910
some entity invested in our endeavor.

1283
01:29:36,630 --> 01:29:37,860
Invested how?

1284
01:29:38,270 --> 01:29:38,940
In...

1285
01:29:40,900 --> 01:29:42,160
the violation

1286
01:29:44,140 --> 01:29:45,750
of inviolate rules.

1287
01:29:48,090 --> 01:29:49,440
Have I gone mad?

1288
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:52,460
Not to me.

1289
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:54,650
I found both bodies.

1290
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:57,150
I'm sleeping with my lights on.

1291
01:29:57,540 --> 01:30:00,570
On top of which, if I don't land a steady job soon,

1292
01:30:00,570 --> 01:30:02,170
I'm gonna have to go back to Michigan.

1293
01:30:08,710 --> 01:30:10,040
I have to tell you something.

1294
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:12,820
What?

1295
01:30:13,510 --> 01:30:15,440
I was Rhodora's personal assistant, right?

1296
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:18,230
I saw her checks, I rolled calls with her.

1297
01:30:18,690 --> 01:30:20,900
I think she sometimes forgot when I was on them.

1298
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:21,670
Tell me.

1299
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:26,780
Your ex-boyfriend, Ed, um...

1300
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:28,400
he worked for her.

1301
01:30:29,450 --> 01:30:31,680
He worked her out. He's a personal trainer.

1302
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:33,020
No.

1303
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:35,070
No, I mean...

1304
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:39,430
Rhodora paid Ed to give her advance word on your reviews.

1305
01:30:40,130 --> 01:30:43,280
Like, okay... He would tell her what you liked before you posted,

1306
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:45,630
and then she'd make buys.

1307
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:53,390
Do I still have the job?

1308
01:30:58,450 --> 01:31:00,350
Here are the keys to my storage space.

1309
01:31:00,350 --> 01:31:02,510
I need everything itemized that's there.

1310
01:31:02,710 --> 01:31:03,430
Okay.

1311
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:18,870
Is my car safe out there?

1312
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:20,210
How the fuck should I know?

1313
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:26,120
Where did you go?

1314
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:29,840
This is Ben. He runs my old artist collective.

1315
01:31:35,770 --> 01:31:37,680
Lovely. Can we go now?

1316
01:31:38,030 --> 01:31:39,090
I'm staying.

1317
01:31:39,590 --> 01:31:41,570
But I don't really like this place.

1318
01:31:41,570 --> 01:31:43,260
Yeah, I'm talking longer timeline.

1319
01:31:43,260 --> 01:31:45,550
I'm leaving Rhodora, her gallery.

1320
01:31:46,390 --> 01:31:47,460
No, you're not.

1321
01:31:47,910 --> 01:31:49,390
I can't be there.

1322
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:52,480
We have a significant show planned. You're high. Come on.

1323
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,050
I'm serious.

1324
01:31:57,920 --> 01:31:59,380
You're about to break big.

1325
01:32:00,410 --> 01:32:02,090
We're taking you global.

1326
01:32:02,860 --> 01:32:04,610
You'd give that up? For what?

1327
01:32:05,230 --> 01:32:08,300
Some sad garage space peddling graffiti murals?

1328
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:11,390
Jesus! What's the point of art if nobody sees it?

1329
01:32:30,810 --> 01:32:31,850
Fuck!

1330
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:56,950
Yeah, there's a car blocking my car. I want it towed.

1331
01:33:58,650 --> 01:34:00,030
I don't know.

1332
01:34:01,220 --> 01:34:02,080
Hang on.

1333
01:34:02,410 --> 01:34:05,320
Oh, 2057 Seventh Street.

1334
01:34:06,290 --> 01:34:07,270
I'm waiting.

1335
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:21,470
Hello?

1337
01:36:44,300 --> 01:36:46,470
I'm just waiting for a tow truck.

1339
01:37:26,410 --> 01:37:27,840
Oh, thank God.

1341
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:39,330
Hello?

1342
01:37:39,810 --> 01:37:40,980
Damrish is leaving.

1343
01:37:42,380 --> 01:37:44,850
He met his old exhibitor in a dive bar

1344
01:37:44,850 --> 01:37:47,150
and told me he's going back. It's over.

1345
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:49,390
Good for him.

1346
01:37:50,180 --> 01:37:52,990
What do you mean, good for him? What are you talking about?

1347
01:37:52,990 --> 01:37:54,420
Josephina, are you aware

1348
01:37:54,420 --> 01:37:57,020
that Dease asked that all his art be destroyed?

1349
01:37:58,060 --> 01:37:59,680
Would it have changed anything?

1350
01:38:00,430 --> 01:38:02,000
Would I have destroyed them?

1351
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:03,610
No.

1352
01:38:04,430 --> 01:38:05,640
He was a master.

1353
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:24,000
Oh, Jesus. Hold on, Josephina.

1354
01:38:24,970 --> 01:38:25,640
Stella.

1355
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:28,600
Stella. Stella.

1356
01:38:28,810 --> 01:38:31,260
Stella. God damn it.

1357
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:57,460
Have you ever felt invisible?

1358
01:39:01,270 --> 01:39:04,180
Once, I built a railroad.

1359
01:39:24,460 --> 01:39:25,460
Rhodora?

1360
01:39:29,830 --> 01:39:30,720
Rhodora?

1361
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:41,750
Come on, Stella. Come on. Come on.

1362
01:39:41,750 --> 01:39:42,720
Stella, come.

1363
01:39:43,470 --> 01:39:46,300
Come on, good girl. Good girl.

1364
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:51,410
Come on, Stella! Damn it!

1365
01:39:51,410 --> 01:39:52,110
Stella!

1366
01:39:52,820 --> 01:39:53,670
Stella!

1367
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:04,590
Rhodora?

1368
01:40:08,550 --> 01:40:09,540
Oh, my God.

1369
01:40:15,030 --> 01:40:17,090
Oh, my... Oh my...

1370
01:40:21,980 --> 01:40:24,040
No, no! No! I understand!

1371
01:40:24,380 --> 01:40:25,570
I understand!

1372
01:40:31,380 --> 01:40:33,140
I can't save you.

1373
01:40:37,990 --> 01:40:40,150
Jesus Christ, I can't believe what just happened.

1375
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:43,000
Josephina? Hello?

1376
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:06,730
Where...

1377
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:32,950
Oh, fuck me!

1379
01:41:44,550 --> 01:41:45,230
What?

1380
01:41:47,620 --> 01:41:48,380
How?

1381
01:41:50,810 --> 01:41:52,710
A storage facility?

1382
01:41:54,710 --> 01:41:56,560
Well, what do they think happened?

1383
01:41:59,420 --> 01:42:01,790
No. I'm not coming in.

1384
01:42:02,490 --> 01:42:03,480
I gotta go.

1385
01:42:23,110 --> 01:42:24,710
Pick up the phone.

1387
01:42:31,050 --> 01:42:32,290
Yeah, we got it.

1388
01:42:32,990 --> 01:42:34,250
No sign of the owner.

1389
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:36,480
We're taking it to Central.

1390
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:37,950
Yeah.

1391
01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:23,740
That's all of it.

1392
01:43:24,620 --> 01:43:25,480
Everything?

1393
01:43:25,530 --> 01:43:28,510
Every image, every drawing, every postcard,

1394
01:43:28,510 --> 01:43:30,020
every piece of art?

1395
01:43:32,590 --> 01:43:34,970
- Say it. - It's completely empty.

1396
01:43:35,050 --> 01:43:37,070
Forty-seven pieces. We removed everything.

1397
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:39,160
Thank you.

1398
01:44:28,190 --> 01:44:30,920
- LAX. Terminal five. - Okay.

1400
01:46:10,170 --> 01:46:11,820
- That's lovely. - Yeah.

1401
01:46:11,970 --> 01:46:12,960
How much?

1402
01:46:13,410 --> 01:46:14,750
I don't know. Five dollars.

1403
01:46:15,830 --> 01:46:16,500
Yeah.

1404
01:46:20,100 --> 01:46:20,840
Thank you.

1405
01:46:25,530 --> 01:46:26,350
Here you go.

1406
01:46:27,020 --> 01:46:28,520
- Thanks. - Take care.
