00:11:24,387 --> 00:11:26,212
也许你来点热巧克力

30
00:11:33,969 --> 00:11:36,256
你还不肯说出自己的名字和部队吗?

我明白你为什么不说话
Your reluctants to talk is understandable.

43
00:12:24,297 --> 00:12:28,622
要是我不得不穿越敌军控制的沙漠,亡命300英里
If I have been force to escape across 300 miles of enemy held desert,

44
00:12:29,547 --> 00:12:31,039
可到头来，

45
00:12:32,047 --> 00:12:34,083
却被法国人抓住
I've been captured by French authorities,

46
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:36,251
我也肯定会很恼火

47
00:12:38,796 --> 00:12:40,075
伯格曼上尉，你过来看，护航的飞机

00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,326
非常英国，少校

00:13:27,081 --> 00:13:29,368
德国犹太人，在英国的军队服役

57
00:13:30,456 --> 00:13:33,289
德国人的身份有时候很有用
However as German's, we still have our uses.

58
00:13:38,455 --> 00:13:40,860
法国佬还会以为是纳粹干的
French will think this is a Nazi raid.

59
00:13:48,288 --> 00:13:50,657
你应该尊重你的敌人,少校

60
00:14:31,283 --> 00:14:34,316
怎么,没见过飞机吗？快干活去！
What's all these? Haven't you seen a bloody airplane before?

61
00:14:34,491 --> 00:14:35,569
Go away!

62
00:14:44,907 --> 00:14:46,981
我是博依德中尉,信号官

63
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:49,105
欢迎来到库法(利比亚)，少校这里太热了

64
00:14:49,281 --> 00:14:52,098
- 哈克尔上校在等您.
- Colonel Harker is expecting you.
- 希望如此，中尉
- I would hope so, Lieutenant...

65
00:14:52,102 --> 00:14:53,734
是的，长官，一切都会好的
I would certainly hope so.

66
00:14:54,656 --> 00:14:55,899
是的，如你所愿
Yes but of course.

67
00:14:56,072 --> 00:14:57,695
来吧，上校等着呢
Come along... man. The Colonel's waiting.

68
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,522
哈克尔上校，长官
Colonel Harker, sir!

69
00:15:13,695 --> 00:15:15,650
和伯格曼上尉到
Major Craig and Captain Bergman reporting.

70
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,981
上尉，很高兴你们能来
Oh... thank you, Boyden.

71
00:15:17,153 --> 00:15:20,897
伯格曼上尉. 克雷格少校
Captain Bergman. Hello Craig!
很高兴你们的到来
Glad you could come.

72
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:23,396
开门见山地说吧
I'll get right to it.

73
00:15:24,444 --> 00:15:26,766
克雷格，你以前曾向上面提交过一个，
Sometimes ago you submitted a plan to staff...

74
00:15:28,068 --> 00:15:31,434
突袭德军在托布鲁克的油库的计划是吗？
hardlining a proposed raid on the German fuel bunkers at Tobruk.

75
00:15:33,443 --> 00:15:36,144
上级通过他们无穷的智慧，驳回了我的建议
In his infinite wisdom, staff turned my plan down.

76
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:38,764
事情确实有一种改变的方式，不是吗，少校？
Things do have a way of changing, don't they... Major?

77
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:41,106
隆梅尔距苏伊士运河只有90英里
Rommel is 90 miles from Suez.

78
00:15:41,109 --> 00:15:43,242
每升汽油,每颗炮弹
Every shell, every gallon of petrol he gets

79
00:15:43,268 --> 00:15:45,455
要走300英里才能运到托布鲁克
has to come 300 miles from Tobruk.

80
00:15:45,983 --> 00:15:49,562
皇家空军尽了力尽了职，但还是有太多补给到了隆梅尔手中
The RAF is doing its best but still too much is getting through.

81
00:15:50,025 --> 00:15:52,429
所以我们要突袭隆梅尔的补给
So we're gonna have a go at Rommel source of supplies.

82
00:15:55,565 --> 00:15:57,521
我是说了些什么.....
Didn't I said something to...

83
00:15:57,982 --> 00:15:59,179
你觉得我的话很可笑吗？
provoke humour?

84
00:16:00,065 --> 00:16:03,430
现在想到这主意的人一定是天才，
Staff has a genius for sitting on it's brain and coming

85
00:16:03,606 --> 00:16:06,059
可惜结果往往与愿望背道而驰
up with perfect hindsight.

86
00:16:07,273 --> 00:16:09,098
麻烦你详细解释一下好吗
Would you cared to expand on that?

87
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,806
我提出那建议的时候， 
When I submitted the plan we could have

88
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,551
我们可以用百十号人炸毁那些油库
blown up their fuel bunkers with a handful of men.

89
00:16:16,063 --> 00:16:18,552
现在我们要用怎么样的方法才能穿过德军的防线？
How in the hell are we supposed to get through their defences now?

90
00:16:18,772 --> 00:16:20,477
乘汽车大模大样过去,少校
Drive through, Major.

91
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:23,507
我们假扮俘虏
Disguised as prisoner of war guarded by

92
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:26,435
由伯格曼上尉的人假扮北非德军负责押送
Captain Bergman personal African Corps.

93
00:16:26,604 --> 00:16:28,561
我们对你的计划作了大幅修改
The plan is still basically yours

94
00:16:28,564 --> 00:16:33,510
现在涉及到陆,海,空三军
but now it will be maximum effort land, sea and earth.

95
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,175
上校,你能给我说说路线吗？
Colonel, could you direct me to the nearest bus stop?

96
00:16:51,601 --> 00:16:52,643
我们在这里，
We are here...

97
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:54,768
这是托布鲁克
Tobruk, here.

98
00:16:55,351 --> 00:16:57,175
你的主要任务是
Your primarily responsibilities is to

99
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:59,823
领着我们的车队, 穿越800英里
route our convoy through 800 miles of

100
00:16:59,849 --> 00:17:02,406
的撒哈拉沙漠
the west desert the Sahara has to offer

101
00:17:02,683 --> 00:17:05,135
直插托布鲁克
right into the back door of Tobruk.

102
00:17:06,766 --> 00:17:09,135
因此，我们费尽心思, 冒极大风险，
That's why we went to so much trouble and it was no

103
00:17:09,307 --> 00:17:10,586
你知道少校
lark, you know... Major,

104
00:17:10,807 --> 00:17:12,681
把你穿过大半个北非带到这儿来
to bring you halfway across North Africa.

105
00:17:12,684 --> 00:17:14,805
我可没要求来这儿旅行,上校
I didn't ask for the trip, Colonel.

106
00:17:14,973 --> 00:17:17,259
- 我以前来过这
- I've been here before.
- 完全正确
- Precisely.

107
00:17:17,473 --> 00:17:20,969
你对这的地形的了解 
Staff believed that your practical knowledge of the terrain is

108
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,259
是这次行动成功的关键
essential on the success of our mission.

109
00:17:24,097 --> 00:17:25,424
那就是你的任务，少校
That is your job, Major.

110
00:17:26,347 --> 00:17:27,970
我们现在继续，开始的时候，
Ours begin when we get there.

111
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,301
到达之后，我们要炸掉港口的炮台，
After we've knocked out their harbour guns installation,

112
00:17:30,472 --> 00:17:33,436
引导海军登陆，炸掉油库后,
we linked up with naval assault troops, destroyed the fuel

113
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,155
从海上撤走
bunkers and evacuate by sea.

114
00:17:35,158 --> 00:17:38,050
他们的炮台在这，梅尔沙湾
Their heavy guns are here, Mersa Cove...

115
00:17:38,263 --> 00:17:41,378
- 这是自杀
- It's suicide.
- 这是命令
- It's orders.

116
00:17:43,553 --> 00:17:45,959
- 我们有多少时间？
- How many days do we have?
- 八天
- Eight.

117
00:17:47,362 --> 00:17:48,403
办不到
Impossible.

118
00:17:48,428 --> 00:17:50,004
办不到，也得办到！
Impossible or not,

119
00:17:50,427 --> 00:17:52,916
必须按计划完成它
it will be done and on schedule.

120
00:17:53,136 --> 00:17:54,925
说的够清楚了吧，克雷格
Do I make myself clear, Craig?

121
00:17:55,344 --> 00:17:56,837
欢迎加入,克雷格少校
Welcome aboard, Major Craig.

122
00:17:58,386 --> 00:18:00,375
平时我们没有自愿者
We don't get many volunteers.

123
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:07,146
要小心犹太人,少校
Keep your eyes and ears open around the Jews,

124
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:10,579
不要太相信他们，信任太过头了可不行
little trust all right, there's no point in overdoing it.

125
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:13,124
这是我在巴勒斯坦呆了6年得到的体会
Six years in Palestine taught me that.

126
00:18:14,925 --> 00:18:16,715
顺便告诉你
And for your information,

127
00:18:16,884 --> 00:18:19,418
我就是提议这次行动的天才
I'm the genius with perfect hindsight.

128
00:18:20,508 --> 00:18:21,965
我从来没有怀疑过，上校
Never doubted it, Colonel.

129
00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:26,415
我们一小时后出发博依德中尉会为您提供协助
We leave in 1 hour, Lieutenant Boyden will see to your needs.

130
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:28,542
克莱格少校
Major Craig...

131
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,877
请不要因为见解不同
don't let personal differences of opinion

132
00:18:32,048 --> 00:18:34,335
妨碍我们的行动
interfered with our operation.

133
00:18:35,007 --> 00:18:36,463
我知道，上校
I understand, Colonel.

134
00:18:37,464 --> 00:18:40,830
不过请你记住一点,就算我们到了托布鲁
I liked you to bear one thing in mind when and if we reached Tobruk,

135
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:43,830
我老妈不想让我冒险做什么英雄
my mother didn't raise any heroes.

136
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,495
血腥的艺术品，但我自己对自己说，画的还行 
A bloody work of art, matey but I do say so meself.

137
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,791
是还行,只是有的地方我们还得再涂点漆
Save the Jerry the trouble of repainting if we are taken.

138
00:18:57,629 --> 00:18:59,287
现在，我想的这样就完美了
Now, that's a cheery thought.

139
00:19:00,462 --> 00:19:01,504
完美了
Handsome.

140
00:19:01,629 --> 00:19:03,453
别偷懒了,动作快点
Come on, get cracking.

141
00:19:03,628 --> 00:19:05,997
没想过得维多利亚十字奖章吗
Never get the Victoria Cross for admiring yourself.

142
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:08,367
长官，我们更可能再得到红十字
It's chai cross we're after, sir.

143
00:19:08,544 --> 00:19:11,033
我只想能多感受些阳光就好了，少校
I think Dolan is a feeling a touch of the sand and sun, Major.

144
00:19:11,211 --> 00:19:13,414
再罗里八嗦的话,就让你尝尝靴子的滋味
You'll be feeling a touch of my boots if you don't hop to.

145
00:19:14,752 --> 00:19:16,493
这是利比亚,不是伦敦
This is Libya, not London.

146
00:19:18,127 --> 00:19:19,454
妈啊，吓死我了 
Well, damn bloody hell!

147
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,988
士兵们，全体下车
Soldiers, get off the vehicle!

148
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,989
列队站好，赶紧！
Line up, hurry!

149
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:44,537
注意，立正！
Attention, stand still!

150
00:19:51,706 --> 00:19:53,697
中尉,整队完毕
Lieutenant, troops in formation.

151
00:19:56,248 --> 00:19:59,447
喔...看到他们我怎么感到我后背凉嗖嗖的
Ooh... got a cold feeling down the back of me neck just looking at 'em.

152
00:19:59,622 --> 00:20:02,240
我们要执行的到底是什么样的鬼任务,长官？
What kind of bleeding mission are we going on anyway, sir?

153
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:05,443
该你们知道的时候会告诉你们的
You know when you're supposed to and not before.

154
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:08,074
或许你自己也不知道吧？军士长
Maybe you don't know either, Sergeant Major.

155
00:20:08,329 --> 00:20:09,822
好了...好了，看够了没有
All right... all right, what is this

156
00:20:09,996 --> 00:20:11,821
你自己的工作都完成了吗？现在赶快
going on with the lot of you?  Come on now.

157
00:20:12,621 --> 00:20:13,782
军士长
Sergeant Major!

158
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:17,036
长官
Sir!

159
00:20:18,828 --> 00:20:20,819
有给我们的命令吗？
Do you have your orders regarding my men?

160
00:20:20,995 --> 00:20:22,322
我们接到的命令
We'll have no dealings with you

161
00:20:22,495 --> 00:20:25,575
是什么都不用做，长官！
as soldiers unless otherwise instructed, sir.

162
00:20:25,785 --> 00:20:28,819
请就请让你的人严格遵守命令,中士
See to those orders are complied with, Sergeant Major.

163
00:20:29,744 --> 00:20:30,785
长官
Sir!

164
00:20:33,826 --> 00:20:36,859
全体,上车！
Attention, break ranks!

165
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:42,066
居然要听德国佬的命令
Taking orders from a ruddy Kraut!

166
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,571
这是打的什么破仗啊？
What's this bleeding war coming to?

167
00:20:47,033 --> 00:20:49,866
要是我在特拉维夫的父亲
If my father in Tel Aviv could see me here now,

168
00:20:50,033 --> 00:20:53,564
现在在这儿看见我跟英国人并肩作战，他肯定要替我脸红
fighting for the British, he would take back my Bar Mitzvah.

169
00:20:53,741 --> 00:20:57,153
战争总是和政治奇妙的混合在一起的
War and politics, Mohnfeld. They're always mix.

170
00:20:57,324 --> 00:21:00,984
他也是这么跟我说的,我得试着把它们分开
There are just the same if he ever finds out. He'll give me an a bris.

171
00:21:03,198 --> 00:21:07,108
好吧，意大利人肯定和他们的德国盟友想法一样
Well, now we know how the Italians must feel with their German allies.

172
00:21:07,281 --> 00:21:10,029
英国人会很快把我们投入战争
And the English will throw us to the wolves just as quick...

173
00:21:11,572 --> 00:21:12,685
如果我们愿意的话
If we let them.

174
00:21:13,197 --> 00:21:14,987
 中士,叫大家做好准备
Get the men ready, Sergeant.

175
00:21:54,693 --> 00:21:56,149
你的子弹够用吗？伙计？
You got bullets in that thing, mate?

176
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,249
- 就知道套近乎
- Talking to the blighty enemy.
- 我们要装扮成俘虏
- We're supposed to be prisoner...

177
00:22:01,252 --> 00:22:03,685
阿法耶，根据命令,我们不能说话
...Alfie. You know the orders, no fraternizing.

178
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,312
我可没工夫拉关系，我只是想知道, 他的枪里有没有子弹
No fraternizing, I just asked him if he's got bullets in that chopper.

179
00:22:07,649 --> 00:22:10,600
我可不想被他当猴耍着玩
I don't want him to take his play acting too much to heart.

180
00:22:12,608 --> 00:22:14,811
他对我说,「这是你的机会」
An opportunity, he says.

181
00:22:14,982 --> 00:22:16,439
- 谁说的? 
- Who says?
- 法官.
- The judge.

182
00:22:16,857 --> 00:22:20,388
3年来，你在监狱里，现在我给你个报效祖国的机会
I'm giving you the chance to serve your country

183
00:22:20,565 --> 00:22:23,811
成为受人尊敬的而且有责任的公民
and to come back to society as a respectable citizen.

184
00:22:23,981 --> 00:22:24,503
上帝保佑他
God bless him.

185
00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:26,541
那你难道想回伦敦去，阿法耶
You wouldn't want to be back in London, Alfie...

186
00:22:26,731 --> 00:22:28,164
那儿也正在挨德国人的炸弹呢
not with all them bombs the Jerry are dropping.

187
00:22:28,168 --> 00:22:29,754
帮我们一个忙，他们曾经就做过
Do us a favour, all they ever did.

188
00:22:29,897 --> 00:22:31,531
它总是炸医院和教堂。 
It's always been hospitals and churches.

189
00:22:31,534 --> 00:22:34,387
德国人绝不会去炸布理克斯顿监狱天哪,我真后悔
They couldn't hit Brixton prison in a 100 years.

190
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,593
天啊，这真热
God, it ain't half hot.

191
00:23:16,351 --> 00:23:19,016
嘿，这就像是过山车！
Just like being on a roller coaster.

192
00:24:26,193 --> 00:24:27,234
布鲁克纳
Bruckner!

193
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:28,538
- 有！
- Yes!
- 过来一下
- Come here.

194
00:24:30,842 --> 00:24:32,797
敌人纵队，是坦克！
Enemy column, tanks!

195
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:44,757
是意大利人，长官
Italian's, sir.

196
00:24:49,756 --> 00:24:51,166
呵，侧翼完全没有警戒
No flanking scouts.

197
00:24:52,548 --> 00:24:54,259
如果我们开火,他们一点机会都没有
If we were an attack force, they'd have little chance.

198
00:24:54,262 --> 00:24:57,294
他们要是开进到距离我们1000码
They should cleared us by 1000 yards.

199
00:24:57,464 --> 00:24:59,419
除非他们改变行军方向
Unless they altered directions,

200
00:24:59,589 --> 00:25:01,212
- 博依德中尉
- Lieutenant Boyden.
- 是，长官
- Yes, sir.

201
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,252
- 通知大家准备战斗
- I want every man armed and ready.
- 是，长官
- Sir!

202
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:48,493
你知道吗现在你有没有想过，布理克斯顿监狱才是个好地方
You know when you come to think of it, Brixton prison's really a nice place.

203
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:51,329
你很伤感啊,阿法耶？
You're getting soft in the konk, Alfie.

204
00:25:51,499 --> 00:25:54,829
我想念那8英尺厚的砖墙,绝好的炸弹避难所
All 8 feet thick of regular bleeding bomb shelter.

205
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:57,746
那该死的法官说：「现在一切都好了」
If I could get my hands on that judge...

206
00:25:58,291 --> 00:26:01,490
- 他硬要把我这无辜的人变成刽子手
- Sending innocent to the slaughter.
- 你还无辜吗？
- Innocent?

207
00:26:03,415 --> 00:26:04,824
笑死我了
I will give something.

208
00:26:55,326 --> 00:26:58,193
撒哈拉沙漠这么大，他们干嘛非要停在那儿?
The whole damn Sahara and they have to stop here.

209
00:28:25,732 --> 00:28:28,019
- 什么事，军士长
- So, Major?
- 又有车队来了，长官
- More company, sir.

210
00:28:28,191 --> 00:28:29,932
在另外一侧
Over there... on the other side.

211
00:28:33,441 --> 00:28:34,638
他们肯定是德军
They must be Germans.

212
00:28:34,856 --> 00:28:37,689
意大利人喜欢舒适，他们不会晚上行军
The Italians are too fond of comfort to travel this late.

213
00:28:43,231 --> 00:28:45,221
他们的哨兵还没发现德国人
Their sentry hasn't seen them yet.

214
00:28:45,397 --> 00:28:47,802
伯格曼,你去悄悄干掉那些哨兵
Take what man you need Bergman and make sure they don't.

215
00:28:48,522 --> 00:28:50,228
布鲁克纳，跟我来
Bruckner, come with me.

216
00:28:52,896 --> 00:28:54,686
他们有多远？
What do you estimate the range?

217
00:28:55,646 --> 00:28:57,388
大约2000码
2.000 yards, maybe even less.

218
00:28:57,604 --> 00:28:59,709
我们迫击炮射程才1000米
Twice the reached range of our mortars.

219
00:28:59,735 --> 00:29:01,208
我去拿测距器
I'll get the range finder.

220
00:29:01,604 --> 00:29:03,179
准备迫击炮
And prepared mortars.

221
00:29:17,852 --> 00:29:18,894
准备好了吗？
You all right?

222
00:29:19,977 --> 00:29:20,600
你呢？
You, okay?

223
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:23,118
好了，中尉，长官. 你不介意我问一下
Lieutenant Boyden, sir. You don't mind me asking...

224
00:29:23,268 --> 00:29:24,508
那老家伙现在想干什么？
What's the old man up to now?

225
00:29:24,534 --> 00:29:26,456
玩个可爱的游戏，阿法耶
A lovely scheme, Alfie.
玩个可爱的游戏
A lovely scheme.

226
00:29:26,768 --> 00:29:29,172
他准备让意大利人和德国人开始自相残杀
He's going to start a bit of fighting between the Italians and the Germans.

227
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,373
他怎么做，长官？
How's he going to do that, sir?

228
00:29:30,377 --> 00:29:34,348
首先用迫击炮先轰德国人，然后再轰意大利人
First we open fire on the Germans, then our mortars hit the Italians.

229
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,928
意大利和德军都以为是对方开的火，
Now the Italians see the German's column and vice-versa.

230
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,808
因为都以为对方是英国人
So both of them got to thinking it's the British army on the

231
00:29:38,834 --> 00:29:40,572
两边互相开火，你觉得呢
other side that's doing all the firing, you see. 

232
00:29:40,724 --> 00:29:42,203
然后你制造了一场自相残杀的闹剧
And you got themselves a bloody battle going.

233
00:29:42,205 --> 00:29:42,953
对
Right.

234
00:29:43,141 --> 00:29:46,174
- 天哪。你认为我们能行吗，长官？
- Blimey, you think we'll make it sir?
- 你知道一些有用的祈祷词吗？阿法耶
- Know any good prayer, Alfie?

235
00:30:41,343 --> 00:30:42,384
距离
Range?

236
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:44,759
距离800
Eight hundreds.

237
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,336
- 士官长...
- Sergeant Major....
- 长官
- Sir.

238
00:30:46,509 --> 00:30:48,749
- 告诉博依德他们开火
- Tell Mr Boyden to open fire.
- 长官
- Sir.

239
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:21,005
先生们
Gentlemen,

240
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:23,081
是时候了，我们该走了
it's time we're moving.

241
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:13,991
真够热的,象血熔炉
It's like a bloody furnace.

242
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:16,747
高兴点，这还没到最热的时候呢
Cheer up, it could get worse.

243
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,826
你到底在做什么 
What's the devil are you doing?

244
00:32:57,994 --> 00:33:01,075
克雷格？在硬地上，我们速度更快，走沙漠要用更多的时间
We're making excellent time on the flats, why head into this area?

245
00:33:01,744 --> 00:33:04,777
从我们在谷地留下的车辙，德国人很快就会明白过，上校
We leave our calling card back there in the wadi, Colonel,

246

00:33:04,952 --> 00:33:06,018
德国人很快就会追踪过来
the Germans bound to find.

247
00:33:06,022 --> 00:33:08,591
没错,但我们有速度优势
Exactly why speed is our best advantage.

248
00:33:08,743 --> 00:33:10,022
他们也知道这一点
They know that too.

249
00:33:10,201 --> 00:33:12,338
他们将会派出飞机搜索，
That's why they'll spending the major part of their times

250
00:33:12,341 --> 00:33:14,635
因此我们要从这儿插过去
guarding Kalafsho Flats while we cut through here.

251
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:17,189
你知道这条路通到哪儿吗，少校？
Do you realised what you're suggesting, Major?

252
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,592
- 知道,长官
Yes, sir!

253
00:33:19,617 --> 00:33:22,188
- 是德军的雷区！
- That's a German minefield.
- 没错
- That's right.

254
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:24,441
所以他们不会来这里找我们，他们想不到
Where they're not likely to looks for us.

255
00:33:25,866 --> 00:33:27,707
我不同意,应该掉头
I don't like it. We're turning around.

256
00:33:27,733 --> 00:33:28,723
那么上校，你将会
Do that Colonel and you'll

257
00:33:28,866 --> 00:33:30,773
当一回真正的战俘了
reached Tobruk as a real prisoner.

258
00:33:47,406 --> 00:33:48,815

It's out of the question.

259
00:33:49,072 --> 00:33:51,577
哈克尔上校,你花费尽心思
Colonel Harker you went to an awful lot of trouble to

260
00:33:51,603 --> 00:33:54,049
把我拐进这个行动
shanghai me in on this mission.

261
00:33:54,488 --> 00:33:57,770
可既然你不听愿我的建议，干嘛还非要把我拉来？
If you're not going to follow my advise, what the hell am I doing here?

262
00:33:57,946 --> 00:34:00,777
可没有探雷器,重型车辆根本过不去
You can't take heavy transport through that without mine detector.

263
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,482
你到底要不要听我的？你带我来就要听我的
Why are you telling me? You brought me along to tell you.

264
00:34:04,737 --> 00:34:07,226
好吧,少校，我洗耳恭听
All right... Major, tell me.

265
00:34:09,195 --> 00:34:10,273
谢谢你，长官
Thank you, sir.

266
00:34:13,194 --> 00:34:15,149
把半履带车开过来！
Bring up the half-track.

267
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,772
这个季节刮南风,日复一日
This time of the year, the wind is from the south.

268
00:34:20,943 --> 00:34:23,015
风把沙子长时间吹成这样的斜面
It blows for months at a time forming a

269
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:25,009
形成厚沙垫能分散压力
sand cushion at the base of the slope.

270
00:34:26,485 --> 00:34:28,630

By keeping to the slope the deep sand will act as

271
00:34:28,656 --> 00:34:30,550
形成厚沙垫能分散压力
a pillow dispersing our weight.

272
00:34:31,901 --> 00:34:33,891
如果半履带车能过
Our heaviest pieces of half-track

273
00:34:34,067 --> 00:34:35,001
其它车辆卡车也能
can make it, the others can.

274
00:34:35,004 --> 00:34:37,043
我知道卡车轮胎将会陷进沙里
I know the lorries wheel will bogged down but the half-track

275
00:34:37,192 --> 00:34:38,732
半履带车能控制住方向
with it's track can maneuver.

276
00:34:38,941 --> 00:34:40,517
你打算如何让卡车通过？
But how do you propose to get the lorries through?

277
00:34:42,191 --> 00:34:43,898
这个雷区布置有段时间了，上校
This is an old mine field, Colonel.

278
00:34:44,066 --> 00:34:46,602
地雷周围堆积了很多沙子，因而会形成马鞍状
The sand covering the mines had plenty of times to settle.

279
00:34:46,775 --> 00:34:48,394
只要停在斜坡上，我就能看清楚
By keeping to the slopes, I will be able to see

280
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,880
地雷的准确位置
the depression over the mines.

281
00:34:50,065 --> 00:34:53,147
你难道想亲自去开路
So you intend to clear the way and pied piper us through?

282
00:34:54,065 --> 00:34:55,107
没错
That's right.

283
00:34:56,481 --> 00:34:58,104
- 泰恩军士长
- Sergeant Major Tyne!
- 长官
- Sir!

284
00:35:00,189 --> 00:35:02,938
你在后面负责做好车辆的伪装
Bring a drum from the lorries with branches and camouflage

285
00:35:03,106 --> 00:35:05,013
- 让大家在车上休息
- to wipe out our tracks.
- 长官
- Sir.

286
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,430
这可不是件容易事
It may not be so simple.

287
00:35:08,813 --> 00:35:11,515
德国人总是布连环雷
The Germans often set their mines at tandem.

288
00:35:11,688 --> 00:35:13,892
你碰上一个，等于碰上了一打儿的地雷
Tried to move one and you could take out a dozen.

289
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:17,559
非常可靠. 所以其余人要在我后面待着
It's very effective. That's why the rest of you will wait behind me.

290
00:35:17,729 --> 00:35:19,305
在我们身后，长校
Behind us, Major.

291
00:35:19,604 --> 00:35:22,472
我陪你去你不能边开车边找地雷
You can't drive and watch those depression of yours.

292
00:35:23,436 --> 00:35:26,434
你愿意的话, 你就当自己是个志愿者吧
Suit yourself. You're the one who volunteer.

293
00:35:56,683 --> 00:35:57,761
往左开
Go to the left.

294
00:35:58,183 --> 00:36:00,303
再往左. 稳住车
Stay to the left. It's digging in.

295
00:36:01,016 --> 00:36:03,385
沙子再厚点的话,我们也应付得了
Goes any deeper we're going to blow up your whole theory.

296
00:36:04,182 --> 00:36:05,592
往高处走
To the high side.

297
00:36:40,512 --> 00:36:41,553
停车！
Stop!

298
00:36:44,428 --> 00:36:46,003
- 在这里等着
- Wait here.
- 这是我的荣幸
- My pleasure!

299
00:37:50,837 --> 00:37:53,372
他还真冷静， 你认为他个种植的雏菊的
He looks so calm, you think he was planting daisies.

300
00:37:53,545 --> 00:37:54,889
是啊,你要明白刺刀捅错一下
You know one wrong tickle with that bayonet

301
00:37:54,892 --> 00:37:56,652
我们就要在坟墓种雏菊了
and we will be pushing up the daisies.

302
00:39:22,285 --> 00:39:25,070
他想一个人挖遍撒哈拉吗?
Does he expect to dig up the whole damn Sahara on his own?

303
00:39:25,827 --> 00:39:27,983
- 军士长泰恩
- Sergeant Major Tyne.
- 长官
- Sir.

304
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:31,219
叫你的人带上刺刀跟我来
Get some men with bayonets and follow me, will you?

305
00:39:31,221 --> 00:39:31,841
长官
Sir.

306
00:39:49,491 --> 00:39:51,695
你干嘛用手指堵着耳朵？
What have you got your fingers in your ears for?

307
00:39:52,116 --> 00:39:52,779
那你干嘛不用你的爪子
What have you got your 

308
00:39:52,783 --> 00:39:56,465
- 堵住耳朵
- fingers in your ears for?
- 我不想站着看到血
- I can't stand the sight of blood.

309
00:39:56,823 --> 00:39:58,730
你为何用手捂住自己的眼睛？
Then why don't you put your hands over your eyes?

310
00:39:59,031 --> 00:40:01,401
好吧，我不想错过到底发生什么事
Well, I want to see what's going on, don't I?

311
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,395
- 我带的点人来了
- I've got some men coming up.
- 没必要
- That won't be necessary.

312
00:40:10,572 --> 00:40:11,946
柏格曼，用机枪打第一个地雷
Give that first one a burst, Bergman.

313
00:40:25,112 --> 00:40:26,153
卧倒
Down!

314
00:40:36,027 --> 00:40:37,686
运气好的话我们可以打出石油
It's just our luck to strike oil.

315
00:40:39,736 --> 00:40:40,777
一下个
Next one.

316
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,936
- 可以走了,上校
- We can move on down, Colonel.
- 我来驾驶
- Let me drive.

317
00:40:55,942 --> 00:40:57,648
我们可以继续前进 
We can move on then.

318
00:40:59,066 --> 00:41:01,306
他们在陆军军官学校里没教过这个,长官
They didn't teach us that at Sandhurst, sir.

319
00:41:02,816 --> 00:41:04,790
他们是很骄傲的,博依德
Look out the Bungalore torpedo, Boyden.

320
00:41:04,793 --> 00:41:05,911
是，长官，谢谢，长官
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

321
00:41:05,937 --> 00:41:08,126
上路,我们要按时间表前进
Get cracking, there's a schedule to keep.

322
00:42:01,518 --> 00:42:02,560
还好吗？博依德
All right, Boyle?

323
00:42:04,142 --> 00:42:04,865
有什么意见吗？
Any complaints?

324
00:42:04,891 --> 00:42:07,479
给可可多一些糖吗,中士？
How about some more sugar for the cocoa, Sergeant Major?

325
00:42:07,482 --> 00:42:09,640
你有你需要的口粮 
You've had your rations that you need.

326
00:42:10,309 --> 00:42:12,927
- 饭菜可口？
- Grub all right?
- 很不错
- It's wonderful.

327
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:24,298
- 有什么意见吗？
- Any complaints?
- 没有，长官
- No, sir.

328
00:42:24,474 --> 00:42:26,097
- 饭菜可口？
- Grub all right?
- 不错
- Lovely.

329
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:29,047
- 胳膊怎么样? 
- How's your arm?
- 哦，没事了
- Oh, fine.

330
00:42:30,139 --> 00:42:32,177
- 小心点，小子
- Make good use of it, boy.
- 知道了
- All right.

331
00:42:33,598 --> 00:42:34,639
长官
Sir.

332
00:42:41,263 --> 00:42:43,930
- 有问题吗？
- Trouble?
- 发动机进沙，坏了
- Carburation's off.

333
00:42:46,638 --> 00:42:48,759
我要说,德国人很会
I'll say one thing for the Germans,

334
00:42:48,785 --> 00:42:50,703
造发动机而且还便宜
they certainly know how to build an engine.

335
00:42:52,596 --> 00:42:55,677
全是免费劳工造的
It doesn't cost much, either, when they use slave labor.

336
00:42:58,678 --> 00:43:00,468
200 犹太人的血汗，少校
Two hundred Jew power, Major.

337
00:43:00,636 --> 00:43:02,757
我们都知道欧洲发生了什么事
We all know what's going on in Europe.

338
00:43:04,428 --> 00:43:05,506
是吗？如果你知道
Well, if you do,

339
00:43:06,135 --> 00:43:07,509
如果你真的知道
if you really do,

340
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:10,174
刚才就不会那么说
there must be a little of the Jew in you.

341
00:43:11,469 --> 00:43:13,792
犹太人和所有人都一样
They say there's a little of the Jew in everyone.

342
00:43:14,844 --> 00:43:15,884
Jah,

343
00:43:16,509 --> 00:43:17,919
纳粹也是这么想的
a little of the Nazi, too.

344
00:43:23,134 --> 00:43:25,835
你们的战争比我们要长,上尉
Your war's going to last a lot longer than mine, Captain.

345
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,456
它已经持续了2000年
It's 2000 years old now.

346
00:43:29,842 --> 00:43:31,832
我们曾遍布世界各地现在
For the first time since Jesus,

347
00:43:32,175 --> 00:43:34,414
我们第一次感觉是个民族
you begin to think and feel as a people.

348
00:43:35,632 --> 00:43:38,500
犹太人四处流浪的日子该结束了我们要和平
Days of the wandering Jew are coming to an end.

349
00:43:39,382 --> 00:43:40,424
我们要回家
We're going home.

350
00:43:41,299 --> 00:43:43,584
- 回巴勒斯坦?
- Palestine?
- 以色列,少校
- Israel, Major.

351
00:43:44,006 --> 00:43:45,048
以色列
Israel.

352
00:43:46,006 --> 00:43:47,380
它是我们的发源地
It's where we begin.

353
00:43:48,631 --> 00:43:50,752
如果英国人不给我们的土地
Anyone looking for trouble in the future,

354
00:43:51,797 --> 00:43:53,455
我们会以自己取的
will know where to find us.

355
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,042
晚上好，少校
Good evening, Major.

356
00:45:02,832 --> 00:45:03,873

Take cover!

357
00:45:18,538 --> 00:45:21,702
- 隐蔽！隐蔽！
- You bleedy fool!
- 我们是英国人！
- We're British!

358
00:45:30,412 --> 00:45:31,738
开火
Open fire!

359
00:46:23,073 --> 00:46:25,359
- 对空火力自由射击！
- Sergeant Major Tyne.
- 长官
- Sir!

360
00:46:28,613 --> 00:46:31,018
掩埋死者,照顾伤员
Formed burial party and see to the wounded.

361
00:46:31,197 --> 00:46:32,238
长官
Sir!

362
00:46:33,697 --> 00:46:35,900
你们四个,快过来！加快速度！
You four, over here... on the double! Come on, move!

363
00:46:36,446 --> 00:46:38,934
我们埋葬好死者就走
We be moving since the burial parties is finished.

364
00:46:39,112 --> 00:46:42,063
何必浪费时间掩不掩埋尸体有何区别？
Why waste the time? A few bit of sand won't make any difference.

365
00:46:42,237 --> 00:46:45,021
-你没听见命令吗?
- You heard the order.
- 老远就能看见这儿的烟火
- That smoke can be seen for miles.

366
00:46:45,236 --> 00:4:47,689
你看，伯格曼，有意见你跟上校说去，
Look Bergman, if you have any complaints take them to the Colonel.

367
00:46:47,861 --> 00:46:49,188
要么就去找个犹太教士来
Or find yourself a rabbi.

368
00:47:17,233 --> 00:47:19,189
无线电话彻底没用了,长官
It's no use, sir. It's had it.

369
00:47:19,858 --> 00:47:23,637
- 应急无线电呢?
- The emergency transmitter?
- 在第三辆卡车上,也报销了
- It's dead, it was in lorry 3.

370
00:47:25,482 --> 00:47:27,986
按命令,除非紧急情况,我们不得打破无线电静默，
Our orders were not to break silence except in an emergency.

371
00:47:27,989 --> 00:47:30,389
开罗会以为一切都在按计划进行
Cairo will assumed we're proceeding as schedule.

372
00:47:30,773 --> 00:47:32,017
下面看我们的了
Let's see that we do.

373
00:47:39,539 --> 00:47:40,580
柏柏尔人
Tuareg.

374
00:47:40,605 --> 00:47:41,932
停火
Hold your fire.

375
00:47:42,689 --> 00:47:43,741
他肯定不是一个人
There's one there's more.

376
00:47:43,767 --> 00:47:44,601
怎么搞的他们第一时间
Wouldn't be the first time

377
00:47:44,604 --> 00:47:46,104
- 就想袭击车队吗?
- they attack a column.
- 英国车队
- English column.

378
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:47,524
这个车队现在属于德军
This column is currently listed as German.

379
00:47:47,525 --> 00:47:49,501
克雷格
Craig.

380
00:47:50,063 --> 00:47:51,390
我去看看他想干嘛
I'll find out what he wants.

381
00:47:53,771 --> 00:47:55,561
中士,把衣服和帽子给我
Sergeant... your tunic and cap.

382
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:35,006
他们俘虏了两个人，他们想要换枪
They have 2 prisoners. They want guns.

383
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:36,641
该死的
Blast!

384
00:48:36,766 --> 00:48:39,301
我们不答应的话恐怕会有麻烦
We've to go along. It wouldn't look right otherwise.

385
00:48:39,474 --> 00:48:41,216
德军俘虏,我们正需要呢
German's prisoners.. it's all we need.

386
00:48:42,515 --> 00:48:43,557
克雷格
Craig.

387
00:48:44,432 --> 00:48:45,473
成交
Agreed!

388
00:48:47,807 --> 00:48:48,885
掩护我
Cover me.

389
00:48:49,432 --> 00:48:50,473
克鲁格
Krug.

390
00:49:03,055 --> 00:49:04,168
看他们
Look at them.

391
00:49:04,721 --> 00:49:06,344
我要我的枪
Wish I had me rifle.

392
00:49:07,055 --> 00:49:08,761
哦,我要有相机就好了
Cor, I wish I had me camera.

393
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:48,255
不敢相信与阿拉伯人讨价还价
Trust an Arab to argue.

394
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:52,251
如果你没有兴趣，我们就要你们的头
And if you are not interested, we will take your heads.

395
00:50:26,837 --> 00:50:27,879
愿平安与你同在
Peace be to you.

396
00:50:44,294 --> 00:50:46,864
怎么样，这次小规模谈判结果如何？
Well, what was that little display all about?

397
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:48,668
一个筹码，上校
A bargaining point, Colonel.

398
00:50:48,919 --> 00:50:51,157
他们要10支步枪和部分弹药 
He'll settled for 10 rifles and some ammunitions.

399
00:50:51,626 --> 00:50:52,870
俘虏？
The prisoners?

400
00:50:53,543 --> 00:50:54,584
英国人
British?

401
00:50:55,001 --> 00:50:56,079
一个父亲一个女儿
Father and daughter.

402
00:50:56,293 --> 00:50:58,578
他们本来要交给德国人的
They wanted to be taken to the Germans.

403
00:51:01,833 --> 00:51:04,867
我们必须尽快赶到开罗
It's absolutely essential we reached Cairo as quickly as possible.

404
00:51:05,167 --> 00:51:06,935
否则,这场战争的进程会受到严重影响
If we don't this campaign as well as the war

405
00:51:06,961 --> 00:51:08,556
itself would be vitally affected.

406
00:51:09,957 --> 00:51:11,394
你告诉我，我凭什么要相信
You expect me to believe this from someone

407
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:12,980
两个沙漠中的流浪汉
found wandering in the desert?

408
00:51:13,332 --> 00:51:15,633
3天之前我们在班加西
Father and I left Von Hellstern's headquarter

409
00:51:15,659 --> 00:51:17,302
见过冯-赫尔姆斯泰德
in Benghazi three nights ago.

410
00:51:17,665 --> 00:51:20,663
我们本该空投到开罗市郊,与当地的间谍会和
We would to be dropped outside Cairo and met by a resident agent's.

411
00:51:20,998 --> 00:51:23,569
可飞机出了故障,飞行员在迫降时死了
Our plane had to make a force landing. The pilot was killed.

412
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:25,968
倒霉的飞行员落地时摔断了他的脖子
Poor chap broke his neck when we hit.

413
00:51:25,994 --> 00:51:27,896
贝都因人很快就会找到我们
The Tribemen found us the following day.

414
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:31,654

Well, if you are to say who you are,

415
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:35,325
你们说自己是德国的间谍，有东西能证明吗
certainly you agent's had some means of identification.

416
00:51:46,845 --> 00:51:47,887
给，有证明
There! Signed by

417
00:51:47,912 --> 00:51:50,863
这是凯瑟林元帅代表元首签署的
Field Marshall Kesselring acting for the Fhrer himself.

418
00:51:53,911 --> 00:51:55,869
与埃及一些军队高级官员
That paper is an agreement between the Reich and

419
00:51:55,895 --> 00:51:57,764
达成的协议
a group of important Egyptian army officers.

420
00:51:57,911 --> 00:51:59,783
主要内容是
For certain considerations

421
00:51:59,994 --> 00:52:03,524
将帮助他们发动对不列颠的圣战
they will arise against the British in a holy war... Jihad.

422
00:52:05,493 --> 00:52:08,444
这里有耶路撒冷穆夫提的签字
The signature and seal beared all the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem.

423
00:52:08,618 --> 00:52:11,236
他是穆斯林世界最有权势的人物
One of the most powerful men in the Muslim's world.

424
00:52:11,492 --> 00:52:13,068
一旦埃及站到我们这边
With Egypt on our side, we have

425
00:52:13,242 --> 00:52:16,020
完全有理由相信整个穆斯林世界都会追随
every reasons to believe the rest of the Muslim's world would follow.

426
00:52:16,023 --> 00:52:18,010
上尉，土耳其需要4
Captain, the Turks alone could put

427
00:52:18,036 --> 00:52:20,344
400万军队对抗俄国
4 millions men into the war against Russia.

428
00:52:20,491 --> 00:52:23,062
没错，一旦隆美尔进入开罗
Exactly, and once Rommel takes Cairo,

429
00:52:23,324 --> 00:52:26,192
穆夫提倒戈，那么整个英军防御系统就会崩溃
the army of the Grand Mufti will moved against the British.

430
00:52:26,491 --> 00:52:28,342
上尉先生,只要你跟班加西联系一下,
If you'll only contact Benghazi, Captain...

431
00:52:28,368 --> 00:52:30,176
几小时后就会有飞机来这里来
they can have a plane here within hours.

432
00:52:30,615 --> 00:52:32,606
不幸的是无线电坏了
Regrettably our radio was destroyed.

433
00:52:32,782 --> 00:52:35,400
- 被英国战斗机炸毁了
- By a British fighter.
- 你必须提供一辆车 
- Then you must provide a vehicle.

434
00:52:35,615 --> 00:52:38,019
并即刻派人把我们护送到最近的基地
And escort us immediately to the nearest base.

435
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:40,941
你认为波曼先生是在命令一个德国军官吗？
Are you presuming Herr Portman to give orders to a German officer

436
00:52:41,156 --> 00:52:43,905
- 我已经跟你解释过了
- But I explained.
- 那是你的事
- That you did.

437
00:52:45,864 --> 00:52:49,229
现在...你要走就支，我们还有任务
And now, you will leave the rest to me.

438
00:52:51,363 --> 00:52:52,772
我们要去托布鲁克
Our destination is Tobruk.

439
00:52:54,155 --> 00:52:55,695
那是我们最近的基地
And that's our nearest base.

440
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:05,966
好好招待我们的客人,孟菲尔德
Make our guests comfortable, Mohnfeld.

441
00:53:05,992 --> 00:53:06,926
当然,上尉
Of course, Captain.

442
00:53:08,028 --> 00:53:09,189
孟菲尔德
Mohnfeld.

443
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:11,893
居然有德国军官叫这种古老的名字
Odd name for a German officer?

444
00:53:12,903 --> 00:53:15,568
我们不是每个人都叫施密特或波特曼
We can't all be named Schmidt, Fraulein Portman.

445
00:53:21,985 --> 00:53:24,375
我们早就知道埃及军队中，
We've been awared of an anti-royalist faction

446
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:26,915
有人对大英帝国不满，可想不到...
in the Egpytian military but this...

447
00:53:27,109 --> 00:53:28,815
这将是我的荣誉，先生们
I'll do the honours, gentlemen.

448
00:53:29,067 --> 00:53:31,141
伯格曼,你这身德国军服只是伪装
That uniform is a disguise, Bergman,

449
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:32,899
它不会装太长时间
don't carry it too far.

450
00:53:33,066 --> 00:53:35,223
枪毙这个女孩都不用麻烦纳粹
Shooting the girl wouldn't trouble the Nazi's.

451
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,474
如果这是什么打扰你，上校 
If that's what bother you, Colonel.

452
00:53:37,691 --> 00:53:40,033
我只是不希望我们的军官中
What bothers me is going into action with

453
00:53:40,059 --> 00:53:42,456
因冲动而鲁莽行事的人
officers who make rash and thoughtless move.

454
00:53:43,149 --> 00:53:45,033
波特曼以为我们是押送俘虏的
Portman's think this is a German column

455
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:47,037
德军车队，我需要他
transporting British prisoners. I want him 

456
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:48,897
就让他们继续这想法好了
to continue in that believe.

457
00:53:49,065 --> 00:53:50,936
当我们抵达布鲁克，上校，又该怎么办呢？
When we reached Tobruk, Colonel, what then?

458
00:53:51,898 --> 00:53:54,682
这份文件和波特曼就是我们的通行证
This paper and the Portman's guarantee our entry.

459
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:56,135
没别的了,上校
Is that all, Colonel?

460
00:53:56,981 --> 00:53:59,648
不,伯格曼上尉,还有
No, Captain Bergman, that is not all.

461
00:54:00,188 --> 00:54:01,979
你既然在这里服役，我希望你
While you served under me I'll expect you

462
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:03,709
像英国军官一样
to conduct youself as a British officer.

463
00:54:04,563 --> 00:54:06,684
不管自己心里是怎么想的，
You'll at all times obey my orders no matter

464
00:54:06,855 --> 00:54:09,058
都必须无条件服从我的命令
how disagreeable it may seem to you.

465
00:54:10,062 --> 00:54:11,176
我说完了,上尉
That is all, Captain.

466
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:23,560
我能理解他的心情
I can understand his feelings.

467
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:26,351
别自以为是了,少校？
You flattered yourself, Major.

468
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,888
他们只对百分比感兴趣
Their only emotions are based on percentages.

469
00:54:30,185 --> 00:54:32,970
死的8个人里面
Eight men were killed today.
有5个是伯格曼的人
Five of them were Bergman's.

470
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:34,885
这百分比你满意了？
How does that fit into your percentages?

471
00:54:35,935 --> 00:54:36,976
克雷格
Craig!

472
00:54:43,726 --> 00:54:44,804
解散
Dismissed!

473
00:54:46,058 --> 00:54:47,432
想听我说句话吗？上校
May I tell you something, Colonel?

474
00:54:48,558 --> 00:54:49,600
你说吧
You may.

475
00:54:50,183 --> 00:54:51,842
你可真行
You're a real joy!

476
00:55:52,885 --> 00:55:54,164
坐好
Come on then sit-up.

477
00:56:31,464 --> 00:56:32,506
4
Four.

478
00:56:32,881 --> 00:56:33,922
3
Three.

479
00:56:34,713 --> 00:56:35,755
1
One.

480
00:56:57,711 --> 00:56:59,168
晚上好，下士
Good evening, Corporal.

481
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:03,160
我想出去走走
I think I'll take a short walk.

482
00:57:40,789 --> 00:57:43,325
- 晚上好，下士
- Goodnight, Corporal.
- 晚上好
- Goodnight.

483
00:57:48,913 --> 00:57:52,279
明天13:00,我们进入托布鲁克
At 13:00 tomorrow we move on Tobruk.

484
00:57:52,455 --> 00:57:53,638
如果我们顺利的话
If all goes well,

485
00:57:53,641 --> 00:57:58,155
我们在晚上20:00拿下港口的大炮
we should be in position to take the harbour defense guns by 20:00 hours.

486
00:57:59,121 --> 00:58:02,735
随后皇家空军开始大规模空袭
Our attack coincides with the massive raid by the RAF.

487
00:58:03,121 --> 00:58:06,651
21:30,皇家海军会出现在港口
At 21:30, naval units will shell the harbour,

488
00:58:06,828 --> 00:58:09,612
并派出部队与我们汇合
while assault troops come ashore to link with us.

489
00:58:10,328 --> 00:58:12,235
我们的主要目标
Our primary objectives,

490
00:58:12,953 --> 00:58:16,234
- 炸毁这儿的地下油库
- are the fuel bunkers here.
- 上校
- Colonel...

491
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:19,858
上校,如果我们无法摧毁岸防炮,我们怎么通知海军？
If we can't reached the guns, how do we warn off the navy?

492
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,572
这有个德国佬的无线电发射台
Jerry has a large transmitter here in the central of the city.

493
00:58:23,784 --> 00:58:25,522
没有必要，希望我们用不上它
Let's hope it won't be necessary.

494
00:58:25,525 --> 00:58:27,740
如果必须用，我们再哪离开？
And if it's necessary, where does that leave us?

495
00:58:28,118 --> 00:58:30,404
我们不会干坐着那就采用你最初的计划，少校
We revert to your original plan, Major.

496
00:58:30,743 --> 00:58:34,605
能破坏多少就破坏多少,然后...逃命
Do what damage we can to Rommel's fuel supply, make a run for it.

497
00:58:35,075 --> 00:58:37,361
好吧，我不介意逃跑,可往哪儿逃呢？
Well, I don't mind running but to where?

498
00:58:37,533 --> 00:58:39,240
没有海军接应,我们往哪逃？
If we're not rescue by sea, we don't get out.

499
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:42,273
少校,我们已经考虑过这种可能了
I'm aware of that possibility, Major.

500
00:58:42,449 --> 00:58:46,395
在苏卢姆海滩安排了备用接应点,会有小舢板在那儿等我们
That's why we have an alternative pick-up down the coast at Sollum.

501
00:58:47,116 --> 00:58:49,272
可苏卢姆海滩在德军大后方
It's a long way to go with the Germans on our back.

502
00:58:50,448 --> 00:58:52,255
万一被俘,我们大不了进战俘营
If we're capture it means a POW camp.

503
00:58:52,258 --> 00:58:55,732
可伯格曼他们怎么办?德国人不会留他们活口的
What about Bergman's men? They can't let themselves be taken alive.

504
00:58:55,948 --> 00:59:00,272
我敢肯定,伯格曼还有他的SIG部下，在自愿参加这次行动前,
I'm quite sure that Captain Bergman and his SIG gave that

505
00:59:00,447 --> 00:59:02,438
都已经仔细考虑过
a very careful consideration

506
00:59:03,489 --> 00:59:05,195
这个问题了
before they volunteer.

507
00:59:06,114 --> 00:59:07,155
谢谢，先生们
Thank you, gentlemen.

508
00:59:16,154 --> 00:59:17,196
伯格曼！
Bergman.

509
00:59:21,112 --> 00:59:23,822
我一直觉得犹太人很精明
I thought you Jews were supposed to be smart.

510
00:59:23,848 --> 00:59:24,911
那是敌人的宣传，伙计
Enemy propaganda, mate.

511
00:59:24,914 --> 00:59:27,543
你刚才为什么不说话?
Why in the hell you didn't speak up in there?

512
00:59:27,569 --> 00:59:28,425
有用吗？
What reason?

513
00:59:28,569 --> 00:59:30,892
日内瓦公约对我们犹太人无效
There's no Geneva Convention for us.

514
00:59:31,902 --> 00:59:34,189
如果你只关心死亡,生命就无法留存
Begin thinking of death and you're no longer sure of your life.

515
00:59:34,361 --> 00:59:38,140
- 这是希伯莱俗语
- It's a Hebrew proverb.
- 烈士也不过是具尸体
- A dead martyr's just another corpse!

516
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:41,597
到底是为什么，需要你这样的牺牲？
What in God's name drive you people.

517
00:59:43,943 --> 00:59:45,020
也许是上帝的旨意
Perhaps his name is enough.

518
00:59:46,359 --> 00:59:47,935
上帝...和哈克尔上校
God and Colonel Harker.

519
00:59:49,275 --> 00:59:52,439
上校是个老古董，老顽固，他根本不关心
Colonel is a soldier of the old school and has old school attitudes.

520
00:59:52,859 --> 00:59:54,398
我们的生死
He doesn't care much for us.

521
00:59:55,316 --> 00:59:56,595
我们也不在乎他
We don't care much for him.

522
00:59:57,149 --> 00:59:59,104
但我们目前需要他，他也需要我们
But he'll be there when we need him.

523
01:00:00,566 --> 01:00:01,975
让我们希望他们都会没事
Let's hope they both will.

524
01:00:02,649 --> 01:00:03,690
晚安，少校
Good night, Major.

525
01:00:42,561 --> 01:00:44,386
别抬头
Don't turn your head.

526
01:00:45,436 --> 01:00:46,549
你是谁
Who are you?

527
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:48,965
朋友
A friend.

528
01:00:50,018 --> 01:00:51,428
为什么不露面
Then why hide?

529
01:00:52,852 --> 01:00:53,893
听好了
Listen carefully,

530
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:57,805
我们都在赌命,但我不能暴露
my life as well as yours are at stake if we are discovered.

531
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:01,427
这只押送队不象你想的那样是德国人，波特曼先生
This column is not what you think, Herr Portman.

532
01:01:01,601 --> 01:01:05,974
你是说伯格曼上尉和其它人都不是德国人？
You mean Captain Bergman and the others are not German?

533
01:01:06,184 --> 01:01:08,754
犹太人...SIG
Jews... SIG.

534
01:01:08,975 --> 01:01:11,380
些俘虏其实是沙漠突击队
Their prisoners are commando's.

535
01:01:11,558 --> 01:01:13,430
他们的目的可想而知
Member of the long range desert group.

536
01:01:15,890 --> 01:01:16,932
烟斗
Tobacco.

537
01:01:18,099 --> 01:01:20,504
那个哨兵抽的烟斗
The tobacco of that sentry was smoking.

538
01:01:21,349 --> 01:01:24,760
自战争开始以来，我们的军队就没有这种东西
Our troops haven't had anything to light since the beginning of the war.

539
01:01:26,014 --> 01:01:29,297
- 你到底是谁? 
- Who the devil are you?
- 这无关紧要
- That is not important.

540
01:01:30,056 --> 01:01:33,800
你的任务才重要
Your mission is and these men know about it.

541
01:01:34,305 --> 01:01:37,089
- 你给托布鲁克报个信
- You must get word to Tobruk.
- 怎么报信？
- But how?

542
01:01:37,305 --> 01:01:39,628
向西走2公里
Two kilometres from here due west,

543
01:01:39,805 --> 01:01:42,210
你会找到一堆石头
you'll will find a myriad of stones in the sand.

544
01:01:42,679 --> 01:01:46,056
再往北走6米,沙子底下，埋着从
Buried in the sand 6 metres north of that marker is a

545
01:01:46,059 --> 01:01:48,798
加亚到托布鲁克的电话线
telephone cable connecting Jalo with Tobruk.

546
01:01:50,346 --> 01:01:51,387
现在
Now...

547
01:01:52,303 --> 01:01:53,630
转过头去
Turn carefully...

548
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:55,511
看着
and look!

549
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:05,710
在地窖里,你会找到一部电话
In the cistern you will find the field phone.

550
01:02:05,885 --> 01:02:09,132
两件披风和武器
A pair of camouflage capes and a weapon.

551
01:02:10,134 --> 01:02:11,176
很好
Very well...

552
01:02:12,759 --> 01:02:16,421
如果你能安排这一切,为什么不自己去找援助
If all this has been arranged, why haven't you send for help?

553
01:02:17,009 --> 01:02:19,082
我不能冒险离开营地
I cannot miss leaving the camp.

554
01:02:19,258 --> 01:02:22,790
只要你跟托布鲁克联系上，几小时我们的装甲部队就能到这里
Once you contact Tobruk, they can have an armour column here within hours.

555
01:02:25,133 --> 01:02:26,211
如果我拒绝呢？
And if I refuse?

556
01:02:27,842 --> 01:02:29,997
你还是能拿铁十字勋章
The Iron Cross will still be yours.

557
01:02:31,299 --> 01:02:33,373
在你死后，波特曼先生
Posthumously, Herr Portman.

558
01:02:34,674 --> 01:02:36,001
转过去,面向墙
Turn back to the wall.

559
01:02:37,715 --> 01:02:39,705
30秒内不准回头
Do not move for 30 seconds.

560
01:03:27,376 --> 01:03:28,418
稍息
At ease!

561
01:03:42,541 --> 01:03:43,455
布鲁克那
Bruckner,

562
01:05:13,906 --> 01:05:15,529
军用电话
A military phone.

563
01:05:17,864 --> 01:05:19,238
英国的左轮手枪
An English revolver.

564
01:05:23,613 --> 01:05:25,770
- 她开走了一辆车
- Take her to the car.
- 是的，中尉
- Yes, Lieutenant.

565
01:05:25,947 --> 01:05:27,108
等等
Wait!

566
01:05:54,819 --> 01:05:55,860
过来
Come forth!

567
01:06:07,208 --> 01:06:08,250
快点
Come on.

568
01:06:08,275 --> 01:06:10,561
- 他们怎么搞到的电话
- How did they get that telephone?
- 这非常简
- It's very simple.

569
01:06:10,733 --> 01:06:12,392
我们中有只鼹鼠
One among us is the enemy.

570
01:06:21,482 --> 01:06:23,888
- 中尉 
- Lieutenant.
- 中士长
- Sergeant.

571
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:26,892
注意，立正！
Attention, stand still!

572
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:35,178
命令你的人交出武器
Order your men to unload their weapons.

573
01:06:44,938 --> 01:06:47,142
我必须拒绝这个命令，上校
I must refused to give that order, Colonel.

574
01:06:55,228 --> 01:06:56,425
泰恩军士长
Sergeant Major Tyne.

575
01:06:57,603 --> 01:06:58,645
长官
Sir!

576
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,723
- 把他们的枪都缴了！
- Disarmed these men!
- 长官
- Sir.

577
01:07:04,519 --> 01:07:06,309
你，你和你，跟我来
You, you and you, come with me.

578
01:07:12,393 --> 01:07:15,225
我喜欢干这事，我从不相信这些人
That's more like it. I never did trust 'em.

579
01:07:15,393 --> 01:07:16,886
德国佬就是德国佬
Once a Jerry, always a Jerry.

580
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:18,867
小偷始终是小偷，对不对，阿发耶？
Once a thief, always a thief. That right Alfie?

581
01:07:18,870 --> 01:07:20,414
干正事吧
Come off it now.

582
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:23,129
到底是哪一个放跑了德国间谍呢？
Who else you think let that damn spy escape?

583
01:07:31,349 --> 01:07:32,890
伯格曼上尉
Captain Bergman,

584
01:07:34,224 --> 01:07:37,174
你有2小时时间找出内奸
you have 2 hours to deliver your traitor.

585
01:08:13,428 --> 01:08:14,707
你最好别乱跑，解散
Try not to move, miss.

586
01:08:15,636 --> 01:08:17,177
你正接受输液
There's a plasma tube in your arm.

587
01:08:22,635 --> 01:08:24,590
- 帕特维特
- Britwaite...
- 军士长。
- Sergeant Major.

588
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:26,383
去叫上校来,快点
Get the Colonel. On the double!

589
01:08:41,091 --> 01:08:42,418
我去找医生
I'll get the M.O!

590
01:09:03,339 --> 01:09:05,626
那个信息...你们发出去没有？
The message... did you get through?

591
01:09:07,173 --> 01:09:08,213
回答我
Answer me!

592
01:09:11,755 --> 01:09:12,999
你把她一个人留在那了？
- You left her alone?
- 是的，长官
- Sir!

593
01:09:17,379 --> 01:09:19,204
- 锁上了，长官
- It's bolted, sir!
- 撞开它
- Break it.

594
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:28,961
从里面反锁了
No one inside it seem.

595
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:30,259
军士长！
Sergeant Major!

596
01:09:30,262 --> 01:09:31,769
- 长官
- Sir.
- 警戒！
- Assistance!

597
01:09:32,253 --> 01:09:34,457
氰化物！快速有效
Cyanide, I've seen it often enough.

598
01:09:49,334 --> 01:09:51,823
我抓住那个叛徒了，上校
You'll find your spy right down the shaft, Colonel.

599
01:09:52,251 --> 01:09:53,292
是谁？
Who is it?

600
01:09:54,583 --> 01:09:57,534
不知道,太黑了,看不清，少校
I don't know. It's very dark down there.

601
01:09:58,167 --> 01:10:00,655
我在远处发现了秘道入口
I found the sentry at the cistern... stabbed!

602
01:10:00,875 --> 01:10:03,197
他还在暗道里
But the traitor was still in the tunnel.

603
01:10:04,041 --> 01:10:05,082
已经死了
He's dead!

604
01:10:17,415 --> 01:10:18,456
布鲁克纳？
Bruckner.

605
01:10:19,290 --> 01:10:21,859
不可能,我认识他十年了
Impossible, I have known him for 10 years.

606
01:10:22,705 --> 01:10:25,110
你自己说的，那姑娘死于氰化物
You said yourself, the girl died from cyanide.

607
01:10:25,330 --> 01:10:27,570
根本不是氰化物
His suicide tablet gone.

608
01:10:42,162 --> 01:10:43,738
这儿，军士长，你看看这个
Here... Sergeant Major, look at this!

609
01:10:43,912 --> 01:10:46,993
真是不吉利的装扮
Cor, what a mess. It's a diabolical liberty.

610
01:10:47,369 --> 01:10:48,992
我相信你，阿尔菲想听我的建议吗？
You know what they say, Britwaite...

611
01:10:49,161 --> 01:10:51,447
闪电不会两次劈到同一个地方
Lightning never struck in the same place twice.

612

01:10:52,036 --> 01:10:53,637
那是你的幸运符
That tunic could be your lucky charm!

613
01:10:53,663 --> 01:10:55,841
那个家伙肯定会流血 ，我只能告诉你这些
That guy can sure bleed, I can tell you that.

614
01:10:56,077 --> 01:10:58,032
- 博依德,觉得怎样？
Well, Boyden...what do you think of that?

615
01:10:58,201 --> 01:10:59,860
- 很逼真,长官
- Pretty convincing, sir.
- 谢谢
- Thank you.

616
01:11:05,118 --> 01:11:06,693
- 上校,我有话要跟您说
I'd like a word with you, Colonel.

617
01:11:07,867 --> 01:11:09,241
- 你们出去吧
- Excuse us please.
- 长官！
- Sir!

618
01:11:18,074 --> 01:11:20,942
好了,少校,有什么话你尽管说吧
All right Major. Get it off your chest and you'll feel better.

619
01:11:23,740 --> 01:11:26,228
你知道让这些人穿德军制服，
Do you realised what will happen if your men are taken in those uniforms?

620
01:11:28,115 --> 01:11:29,157
万一被俘会有什么结果吗？
They'll be executed.

621
01:11:29,323 --> 01:11:30,733
你一点没觉得不安吗？
And that doesn't bother you at all?

622
01:11:31,282 --> 01:11:34,113
这是精心计划过且完全必要的冒险
It's a calculated and most necessary risks.

623
01:11:34,739 --> 01:11:37,939
是我下命令收缴SIG的武器，
I've given orders to return ammunitions to the SIG.

624
01:11:38,114 --> 01:11:39,939
我在每辆车上安排了我们英国人
I'm also assigning armed British troops

625
01:11:40,114 --> 01:11:42,483
身穿德军制服拿武器掩护
in German uniform to cover each lorry.

626
01:11:42,655 --> 01:11:44,029
伯格曼感觉好些了吗？
How does Bergman feel about that?

627
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:46,145
这不是一次大众比赛 
This is not a popularity contest.

628
01:11:46,738 --> 01:11:48,883
我一点也不在乎别人怎么看我的行为 
I don't give a damn what anybody thinks of my actions,

629
01:11:48,909 --> 01:11:51,052
再说他们是一群古怪的犹太人
least of all a dozen odd Jews.

630
01:11:51,237 --> 01:11:52,952
没有布鲁克纳，在急要关头时 
No Bruckner, when the chips are down.

631
01:11:52,956 --> 01:11:54,919
你越要果断，对不对？
You passed judgement on people quickly, don't you?

632
01:11:54,945 --> 01:11:56,753
你这是固执和偏见
Just like that and head's are supposed to roll.

633
01:11:56,945 --> 01:12:00,191
我本来就没想过要为什么事业光荣牺牲，
Well, I 've never considered dying for a cause no matter how noble.

634
01:12:00,569 --> 01:12:03,022
- 现在更加不想为你这样的人卖命。
- And I'm not about to begin now.
- 你害怕了,少校？
- Frightened, Major?

635
01:12:04,778 --> 01:12:07,183
或许你血管里流的是冰水，可我血管里的血，上校
You may have ice water running through your veins, Colonel...

636
01:12:07,361 --> 01:12:09,848
我一滴也不想失去它也会拒绝的
but I have blood and I need every drop of it.

637
01:12:10,193 --> 01:12:12,267
我的看法，我们有两条道可以选
The way I see it, we have 2 chances of coming out of this.

638
01:12:12,485 --> 01:12:15,518
- 要么善待他们，要么不
- A poor one and a slim one.
- 是的，克雷格
- Yes, Craig.

639
01:12:15,693 --> 01:12:18,809
一开始,是你的热情鼓舞了我
From the beginning your boundless enthusiam has been an inspiration.

640
01:12:19,567 --> 01:12:23,015
但很奇怪你会背上那么重的负担
But I'm getting rather weary of being the cross that you've to bear.

641
01:12:23,192 --> 01:12:24,982
别把自己看太高了,上校
Don't flatter yourself, Colonel.

642
01:12:25,276 --> 01:12:27,728
那些战士也是人
I've trunks full of crosses to bear.

643
01:12:31,650 --> 01:12:33,024
你觉得好点了吗，少校
Feeling better, Major?

644
01:12:36,357 --> 01:12:38,015
我们10分钟后出发
We leave in 10 minutes.

645
01:13:14,061 --> 01:13:15,103
机动搜索队！
Head hunters!

646
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:16,894
野战宪兵
Field police.

647
01:13:35,851 --> 01:13:37,130
没这个必要,中尉
Is that necessary, Lieutenant?

648
01:13:37,351 --> 01:13:38,760
希望如此，赫尔中尉 
I hope not, Herr Oberleutnant.

649
01:13:42,267 --> 01:13:44,720
抱歉,这是命令
Sorry mate... orders!

650
01:14:55,384 --> 01:14:57,670
对他们好些...50码远
Keep pace with them... 50 yards back.

651
01:16:20,666 --> 01:16:23,912
上校,这条去托布鲁克的路上有很多岔道
Colonel, this road takes us through Tobruk and then it branches.

652
01:16:24,082 --> 01:16:28,241
右边通向一座监狱,左边通向梅萨湾
To the right is the prison compound, to the left is Mersa Cove.

653
01:17:27,533 --> 01:17:28,575
好的
Well...

654
01:17:29,033 --> 01:17:31,320
你是军官,叫他们让开
You're an officer, clear the way.

655
01:17:32,867 --> 01:17:33,908
你们！你们！闪开！
Move away!

656
01:17:34,325 --> 01:17:35,367
走开，你这蠢驴
Move away!

657
01:17:44,199 --> 01:17:45,395
祝贺你
Congratulation!

658
01:17:58,864 --> 01:18:01,020
托布鲁克的无线电发射塔就在我们后面
Their radio towers behind us.

659
01:18:42,442 --> 01:18:45,854
上校,我们到了，要向总部发送信息吗？
Colonel, I think I'd like to put in for a transfer.

660
01:18:58,940 --> 01:19:00,931
德军非洲军团的一半都在这儿
Half the Africa Corps.

661
01:19:01,107 --> 01:19:04,270
- 沙漠之狐又有力量了
- The foxes done it again.
- 这会儿英国狮子在睡觉
- While the British lion slept.

662
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:06,166
这更证明了我们破坏德军的燃料储存任务的重要性
Gentlemen, the importance of our mission is

663
01:19:06,192 --> 01:19:07,664
没有燃料，他们是动弹不得的
even graver than staff realised.

664
01:19:07,814 --> 01:19:09,639
这解决不了问题，上校
That's doesn't solved the problem, Colonel.

665
01:19:09,814 --> 01:19:11,970
就算我们登陆时只会遇到轻微的抵抗，
Our men are going to land expecting light opposition

666
01:19:12,147 --> 01:19:14,636
可立刻就会遭遇到隆梅尔的全部预备队
and they're gonna run into Rommel's total reserve strength.

667
01:19:15,314 --> 01:19:17,636
我们得占领发射塔
They must be stopped.
通知他们取消登陆行动
We've to take that transmitter.

668
01:19:17,813 --> 01:19:20,728
在行动已经开始的时候向德国人发出警报
And alert Jerry, for all we know staff may have scrubbed the mission already.

669
01:19:20,896 --> 01:19:22,519
- 我们什么也不做，只是等待吗？
- So, we just sit back and wait.
- 没错
- Exactly!

670
01:19:22,730 --> 01:19:25,431
就算登陆行动取消, 我们也要完成自己的任务
If it has been cancel, we won't have given ourselves away.

671
01:19:26,062 --> 01:19:28,729
就我们这些人怎么对付整整两个师的德国人？
What can a handful of men do against 2 full divisions?

672
01:19:28,937 --> 01:19:30,430
那我们也得试一试，少校
We can try, Major.

673
01:19:31,270 --> 01:19:34,635
如果这些坦克到了阿拉曼,德国人就将占领埃及
If those tanks reach El Alamein, the Germans have Egypt.

674
01:19:34,853 --> 01:19:37,471
他们可能占领，但我们才是关键
They may have the lock, but we have the key.

675
01:19:37,644 --> 01:19:39,303
没有燃料德国佬的坦克哪也去不了
Without fuel, Jerry goes nowhere!

676
01:19:42,519 --> 01:19:44,390
你看起来不太高兴,少校
You don't look too well, Major.

677
01:19:46,685 --> 01:19:48,391
一点也不奇怪
Not surprised to hear it.

678
01:20:12,890 --> 01:20:14,928
我们的海军应该解释一下，
We'll have to have a word with the admiralty about this.

679
01:20:15,432 --> 01:20:17,672
我还以为托布鲁克港一直被海军封锁着呢
I thought Tobruk was the name of a blockade.

680
01:20:17,849 --> 01:20:19,922
也一定是有人忘了跟德国人说了
Someone forgot to tell the Germans.

681
01:20:28,472 --> 01:20:29,964
那就是我们的目标
There's our objective.

682
01:20:30,430 --> 01:20:33,049
隆梅尔的地下油库
Rommel's underground fuel dumps.

683
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:36,847
很显然皇家空军一直无法摧毁它
Easy to see why aircraft had such little effect.

684
01:22:48,498 --> 01:22:50,369
我们已经找到了通信电缆
We've located the communications cable.

685
01:22:50,395 --> 01:22:52,351
我们随时可以切断连接地堡和市区的通讯电缆
The bunker can be cut off from the city anytime.

686
01:23:04,163 --> 01:23:05,572
我们去干掉那些大炮
While we go for the guns,

687
01:23:05,788 --> 01:23:08,572
同时另外2组干掉地堡
two detachments will take out those pillboxes.

688
01:23:19,412 --> 01:23:20,785
真准时
Right on schedule.

689
01:23:22,286 --> 01:23:23,827
分秒不差
Right into a meat grinder.

690
01:23:30,077 --> 01:23:31,948
- 博依德,趁空袭掩护
- Boyden, the air raid's your cover.
- 长宙
- Sir.

691
01:23:32,202 --> 01:23:34,571
带上你的人去占领德国佬的发射塔
Take what men you need and go for the Jerry's transmitter.

692
01:23:34,743 --> 01:23:38,358
给开罗发出取消登陆的信号，重复：取消登陆
Send an open signal to Cairo. Cancel landing, repeat... cancel landing.

693
01:23:38,535 --> 01:23:40,046
还有凯塞林的文件发出去
And advise staff of the Kesselring paper.

694
01:23:40,048 --> 01:23:40,596
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

695
01:23:40,742 --> 01:23:42,021
哈尔克上校
Colonel Harker.

696
01:23:42,409 --> 01:23:45,111
中尉不会说德语,如果有人拦阻,他们死定了
If Lieutenant Boyden should be stopped, he doesn't speak German.

697
01:23:45,326 --> 01:23:48,109
- 那你自愿去吗，孟菲尔德?
- Volunteering, Mohnfeld?
- 给他增加成功的机会，长官
- It would improve his chances, sir.

698
01:24:11,073 --> 01:24:14,438
到防空洞。担架。清理屋子 
To the air raid shelter. Stretchers. Make room.

699
01:24:15,113 --> 01:24:16,736
让开！
Make way!

700
01:24:18,363 --> 01:24:20,603
快来，快.....来！
Come on, move... come!

701
01:24:54,018 --> 01:24:55,359
还活着
Well done.

702
01:25:06,350 --> 01:25:07,727
快点，好了没有？
Harry, are you all right?

703
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:10,103
哦，是的，我很可爱 
Oh yeah, I'm lovely. 
我们还有事要作
Let's do it again.

704
01:25:10,274 --> 01:25:11,932
起来吧，兄弟，来吧
That's more like it, my boy. Come on!

705
01:25:17,816 --> 01:25:18,856
长官
Sir...

706
01:25:21,398 --> 01:25:22,440
长官
Sir...

707
01:25:24,815 --> 01:25:25,893
他死了
He's dead.

708
01:25:30,855 --> 01:25:34,387
快点，很快就会结束的，我们逃走吧
Hurry up, it will be all over us in a minute. Lift him up.

709
01:25:34,855 --> 01:25:36,052
撬开门
Pry open the door.

710
01:25:41,396 --> 01:25:42,805
- 有他吗？
- Got him?
- 是的
- Yes.

711
01:25:45,354 --> 01:25:46,811
快点，到这
Quick, in here!

712
01:25:47,062 --> 01:25:50,806
快速找掩护
Quick. Take cover.

713
01:25:50,978 --> 01:25:53,052
所有人都快点
Everyone, come on, quickly!

714
01:25:56,019 --> 01:25:57,061
离开他
Leave him.

715
01:25:57,186 --> 01:25:58,180
他们成功袭击的指挥部
They have succesfully hit headquarters.

716
01:25:58,352 --> 01:26:01,552
担架
Stretchers.

717
01:26:02,394 --> 01:26:04,099
我们真是夹在中间了
Cor, that was a whisker away.

718
01:26:04,268 --> 01:26:06,757
- 现在怎么办，阿尔菲？
- What do we do now, Alfie?
- 问得好，伙计
- Good question, mate.

719
01:26:06,935 --> 01:26:09,055
得好首先脱了德军制服
First of all, unload these Jerry uniforms.

720
01:26:09,226 --> 01:26:11,975
我可不想被当作间谍处死
My mama didnt bring me up to be shot as a bloody spy.

721
01:26:13,184 --> 01:26:14,225
亲爱的主啊！
Dear God!

722
01:26:15,017 --> 01:26:16,059
什么事，你受伤了吗？
What's the matter, you hurt?

723
01:26:16,225 --> 01:26:19,093
我死一定去天堂，告诉我她，看这里
I'm dead and gone to heaven, tell her. Look in there!

724
01:26:23,183 --> 01:26:25,849
你看，是英国钞票,上百万英镑！
Here look, English pound notes. Millions of them!

725
01:26:26,016 --> 01:26:27,971
真正的英国钞票！，阿法耶
British paymaster wrappers, Alfie.

726
01:26:28,141 --> 01:26:30,381
一定是德国佬从托布鲁克抢的
The Jerries must've grabbed it when they took Tobruk from our boys.

727
01:26:30,558 --> 01:26:32,263
我们可以拿回来,不是吗
Well, we better grab it back then.

728
01:26:37,682 --> 01:26:39,940
等等,你弄错了,我们不是要抢钱？
Here now, wait a minute. You've got it wrong.

729
01:26:39,966 --> 01:26:41,830
我们不能偷这些钱....
We weren't going to nick this money--

730
01:26:52,263 --> 01:26:54,005
我们下一个，少校
We're up next, Major.

731
01:27:11,303 --> 01:27:14,052
现在是21.30
It's 21:30.
博依德他们能成功吗？
Do you think Boyden got through?

732
01:27:25,884 --> 01:27:27,163
我们正在被攻击！
We're under attack!

733
01:27:27,342 --> 01:27:29,546
快点，你这个呆子
Quickly, to your posts!

734
01:27:30,342 --> 01:27:33,175
登陆仍在，信号兵发来信号
Landing is still on, the buzzers are coming in.

735
01:27:33,342 --> 01:27:35,000
- 泰恩中士
- Sergeant Tyne.
- 长官
- Sir!

736
01:27:35,175 --> 01:27:37,082
带上4个人,开半履带车去公路上
Take the half-track and four men up the approach road.

737
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:39,623
用灯光示意军舰回去
Use the oil's lamp to turn those barges back.

738
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:41,127
尽你所能吧，杰克
Keep flashing as long as you can, Jack.

739
01:27:41,341 --> 01:27:43,747
- 这是我们最后的机会了
- It's our last chance.
- 长官
- Sir.

740
01:29:25,954 --> 01:29:27,826
- 进来，进来？
- Come in, come in?
- 怎么样了？
- What's happening?

741
01:29:27,996 --> 01:29:30,236
- 线路都断了
- The line is dead.
- 继续试
- Try again.

742
01:29:30,454 --> 01:29:31,496
线路接不通
It's not working.

743
01:29:44,911 --> 01:29:45,952
炸药包
Satchel charge.

744
01:29:50,494 --> 01:29:52,697
- 外面发生什么事了？
- What's happening here?
- 出去！
- Outside!

745
01:30:26,698 --> 01:30:27,739
- 信号枪
- Flare pistol.
- 长官
- Sir.

746
01:30:55,736 --> 01:30:57,015
干的不错，长官
Good try, sir.

747
01:30:58,319 --> 01:31:01,401
- 看着不怎么的
- Seems to lost the old magic wand.
- 再炸一次
- Regroup now.

748
01:31:13,442 --> 01:31:14,721
小胡子万岁
Heil Hitler!

749
01:31:29,566 --> 01:31:31,272
- 哈尔克上校
- Colonel Harker.
- 克鲁格
- Craig.

750
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:34,308
- 我们的船来了！
- They're coming in.
- 到海滩去
- Get down to the beach!

751
01:31:34,482 --> 01:31:36,302
他们需要帮助
They're gonna need all the help they can get.

752
01:31:36,328 --> 01:31:36,960
掩护！
Take cover!

753
01:32:00,479 --> 01:32:01,521
德国佬！
Jerries!

754
01:32:07,311 --> 01:32:09,219
半履带车，开火！
Half-track! Open fire!

755
01:32:28,601 --> 01:32:30,010
这些混蛋
Get the bastards.

756
01:32:44,307 --> 01:32:45,421
他们退回去了
They're turning back.

757
01:32:45,849 --> 01:32:48,800
- 泰恩中士他们成功了
- The Sergeant Major got through.
- 感谢上帝
- Thank God.

758
01:32:55,806 --> 01:32:57,050
散开，隐蔽！
Take cover under the cliffs!

759
01:33:15,929 --> 01:33:17,339
该死的坦克！
Bloody tanks!

760
01:33:18,179 --> 01:33:20,418
它们会把我们炸的粉碎
They would have chopped our barges to pieces.

761
01:33:28,387 --> 01:33:30,258


762
01:33:46,676 --> 01:33:49,424
有那些坦克在上面，我们哪也去不了
We're just not going anywhere with those damn tanks out there.

763
01:33:49,925 --> 01:33:52,592
他们把我们挡在这儿，一会步兵就会来
They've pinned us here until their infantry moves in.

764
01:34:10,882 --> 01:34:12,422
上校,或许我能到上面去
I think I can get up there, Colonel.

765
01:34:20,089 --> 01:34:22,044
你还是决定当烈士了
Still determined to be a martyr, aren't you?

766
01:34:22,256 --> 01:34:24,245
从来没有想过，只是现在逃不掉了
I never did believe we'd get through this so long.

767
01:34:25,630 --> 01:34:29,540
此外,德国人也不会留我们活口
Besides, German hospitality does not appeal to me.

768
01:34:31,296 --> 01:34:32,435
你对付坦克
You pull those tanks...

769
01:34:32,438 --> 01:34:34,686
我毁掉油库，作为临别礼物 
and I'll give you the fuel bunkers as a going-away present.

770
01:34:35,087 --> 01:34:36,959
我只是希望我的经验还有用
Best job I've had all day.

771
01:34:37,837 --> 01:34:38,879
克鲁格
Krug.

772
01:34:39,379 --> 01:34:40,575
我带三个人
I'll take three men.

773
01:34:40,754 --> 01:34:42,743
其它就跟着克雷格少校
The rest of you stay here with Major Craig.

774
01:34:46,211 --> 01:34:47,253
好运
Shalom!

775
01:34:49,169 --> 01:34:50,413
好运,上尉
Shalom, Captain.

776
01:34:54,085 --> 01:34:55,791
我祝你好运，伯格曼
I wish you luck, Bergman.

777
01:34:56,585 --> 01:34:57,627
我诚心诚意的
I mean it.

778
01:34:59,168 --> 01:35:01,158
我们都需要运气，上校
We're both going to need it, Colonel.

779
01:35:03,167 --> 01:35:04,494
但不要偷我的东西
But don't steal any from mine.

780
01:35:06,751 --> 01:35:07,994
我要回去了
I'm going back up!

781
01:35:10,083 --> 01:35:11,161
犹太人
Mazeltov.

782
01:35:46,037 --> 01:35:47,079
看
Look!

783
01:35:48,662 --> 01:35:49,704
他们要来了 
They're coming down!

784
01:37:09,362 --> 01:37:11,234
注意，前排掩护
Watch out. Cover the rear!

785
01:37:45,024 --> 01:37:47,098
好吧，各位，加快速度
All right lads, at the double!

786
01:39:13,432 --> 01:39:15,836
- 我们要拿下这些坦克
- We gotta take that tank.
- 荣幸之至
- My pleasure.

787
01:39:16,056 --> 01:39:18,260
不，我们用得着那坦克
No, let me have that.

788
01:39:22,514 --> 01:39:24,670
需要那坦克完成任务
Need that tank operational.

789
01:39:25,055 --> 01:39:26,097
刺刀
Field knife.

790
01:40:12,633 --> 01:40:14,790
- 手榴弹
- Grenade!
- 快出去！
- Get out, get out!

791
01:40:46,088 --> 01:40:47,249
撤退！
Dig in!

792
01:41:23,417 --> 01:41:25,952
向左转,中士.闯进去！
Hard left, Sergeant! Take her through!

793
01:41:43,540 --> 01:41:45,447
- 左边,88炮.
- 88 on the left.
- 中尉
- Lieutenant.

794
01:41:45,665 --> 01:41:46,707
准备
Ready.

795
01:41:52,997 --> 01:41:54,039
准备
Ready.

796
01:42:20,119 --> 01:42:21,861
电台右上角
Hub station, off to the right.

797
01:42:43,658 --> 01:42:45,944
他们陷入了混乱！
They're at an impasse.

798
01:43:25,779 --> 01:43:28,562
我们先敲掉上面的，再干掉下面那个
We'll hit the top level first. Then work our way down.

799
01:44:37,063 --> 01:44:40,428
我们该走了，中士，否则我们也要完蛋！
Get us out of here, Sergeant, before we blow up with it!

800
01:45:29,848 --> 01:45:31,471
我的老天！
Good lord!

801
01:45:34,765 --> 01:45:36,422
他们真把油库炸了
They have blown the reserve.

802
01:45:37,306 --> 01:45:38,680
离不开运气....
With any luck...

803
01:45:39,139 --> 01:45:42,007
隆梅尔向苏伊士的攻势到此为止了
We've seen the end of Rommel's push to the Suez.

804
01:45:43,389 --> 01:45:44,715
哈尔克上校
Colonel Harker.

805
01:45:45,263 --> 01:45:49,091
继续抵抗只会造成无谓的伤亡
Your continued resistance will only result in a futile loss of lives.

806
01:45:49,805 --> 01:45:51,345
我要求你们投降吧
I ask you to surrender.

807
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:54,468
长官，他知道你的名字
He knows your name, sir.

808
01:45:55,804 --> 01:45:57,427
和我们的情况
And our situation.

809
01:45:59,720 --> 01:46:02,007
我们已经完成了预定任务
We've done what we set out to do.

810
01:46:28,884 --> 01:46:29,996
举手吧
Hands up.

811
01:46:30,425 --> 01:46:32,083
快走！别停下！
Come on, quick.

812
01:46:35,425 --> 01:46:38,292
都别动！
Nobody move.

813
01:46:38,466 --> 01:46:41,416
谁动谁死
Whoever moves, dies.

814
01:47:01,963 --> 01:47:03,421
祝贺你,上校
My compliments, Colonel.

815
01:47:04,255 --> 01:47:06,167
你能保证我们的伤员
I have your assurance that our wounded..

816
01:47:06,193 --> 01:47:07,810
得到良好的治疗吗
...will receive prompt medical care?

817
01:47:08,587 --> 01:47:10,210
绝对最好的治疗
The best we can provide.

818
01:47:11,754 --> 01:47:14,752
前提是你交出凯瑟林元帅的文件
As soon as you surrender the Kesselring document, Colonel Harker.

819
01:47:20,128 --> 01:47:21,170
孟费尔德
Mohnfeld.

820
01:47:21,586 --> 01:47:23,293
我的名字是冯 克鲁格
The name is Von Kroeger.

821
01:47:23,670 --> 01:47:24,710
冯 克鲁格
Von Kroeger,

822
01:47:25,210 --> 01:47:27,248
不需要我提醒你日内瓦公约吧
need I remind you of protocol?

823
01:47:28,252 --> 01:47:30,077
这是情报部门的事情
This is an intelligence matter.

824
01:47:30,835 --> 01:47:32,114
布鲁克那不是内奸
And it wasn't Bruckner.

825
01:47:32,377 --> 01:47:36,073
是那个犹太人在暗道里发现了我
What I told you was the truth, with one slight alteration.

826
01:47:36,501 --> 01:47:38,575
，我只有杀了他灭口
That you found me in the tunnel.

827
01:47:39,626 --> 01:47:40,704
文件呢
The paper please.

828
01:47:41,543 --> 01:47:45,203
作为一个士兵,我们没有过多的奢望
As soldiers, we have few saving graces.

829
01:47:47,583 --> 01:47:50,498
也许他该做的就是，
Perhaps our willingness to die for what we believe...

830
01:47:51,166 --> 01:47:52,409
为他的信念而死
is all that matters.
