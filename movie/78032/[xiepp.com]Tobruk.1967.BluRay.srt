We're both going to need it, Colonel.

But don't steal any from mine.

All right lads, at the double!

No, let me have that.

788
01:39:22,514 --> 01:39:24,670

Need that tank operational.

Hub station, off to the right.

They're at an impasse.

We'll hit the top level first. Then work our way down.

���Ǹ����ˣ���ʿ����������ҲҪ�군��
Get us out of here, Sergeant, before we blow up with it!

With any luck...

We've seen the end of Rommel's push to the Suez.

Colonel Harker.

805

Your continued resistance will only result in a futile loss of lives.

806
01:45:49,805 --> 01:45:51,345

I ask you to surrender.

He knows your name, sir.

And our situation.

809
01:45:59,720 --> 01:46:02,007

We've done what we set out to do.

Come on, quick.

���𶯣�
Nobody move.

813
01:46:38,466 --> 01:46:41,416
˭��˭��
Whoever moves, dies.

814

My compliments, Colonel.

815

I have your assurance that our wounded..

...will receive prompt medical care?

817
01:47:08,587 --> 01:47:10,210

The best we can provide.

818

As soon as you surrender the Kesselring document, Colonel Harker.

Mohnfeld.

Von Kroeger,

822
01:47:25,210 --> 01:47:27,248
����Ҫ�������������߹�Լ��
need I remind you of protocol?

823
01:47:28,252 --> 01:47:30,077
�����鱨���ŵ�����
This is an intelligence matter.

824
01:47:30,835 --> 01:47:32,114
��³���ǲ����ڼ�
And it wasn't Bruckner.

825

���Ǹ���̫���ڰ����﷢������
What I told you was the truth, with one slight alteration.

826
01:47:36,501 --> 01:47:38,575

That you found me in the tunnel.

The paper please.

828
01:47:41,543 --> 01:47:45,203
��Ϊһ��ʿ��,����û�й��������
As soldiers, we have few saving graces.

829
01:47:47,583 --> 01:47:50,498
Ҳ���������ľ��ǣ�
Perhaps our willingness to die for what we believe...

830
01:47:51,166 --> 01:47:52,409
Ϊ�����������
is all that matters.
