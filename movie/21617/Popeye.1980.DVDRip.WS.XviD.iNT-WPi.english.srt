1
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,680
Hey, what's this,
one of Bluto's tricks?

2
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,720
I'm in the wrong movie.

3
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,760
Sweet Sweethaven

4
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:57,800
God must love us

5
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,520
We the people

6
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,720
Love Sweethaven

7
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,760
Hooray, hooray, Sweethaven

8
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,560
Flags are wavin'

9
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,080
We're people from the sea

10
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,080
Safe from democracy

11
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,880
Sweeter than a melon tree

12
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,560
Put here for you and me

13
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,000
Sweethaven

14
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,640
Sweet Sweethaven

15
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,320
God must love us

16
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,320
We the people

17
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,680
Of Sweethaven

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
God must have landed here

19
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,720
Why else
would he strand us here?

20
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,720
Where the air
is nice and clear

21
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,000
Sweethaven
even sounds so near

22
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,360
To Heaven

23
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:39,240
God will always bless
Sweethaven

24
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:50,640
God will always
bless Sweethaven

25
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:02,160
God will always bless
Sweethaven.

26
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,400
You just dock?

27
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,600
- I have.
- Uh-huh.

28
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,440
There'll be 25 cents
docking tax.

29
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,880
What for?

30
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,680
Where's your seacraft?

31
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,720
It ain't no seacraft.

32
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,560
It's me dinghy,
and it's under the wharf.

33
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,680
Aha. Ah, huh.

34
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,720
This your goods?

35
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,960
- They is.
- Yeah?

36
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,440
You're new in town, right?

37
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,560
You call this a town?

38
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,760
Yeah.

39
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,960
Well, first of all,

40
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,720
there's 17 cents
new-in-town tax.

41
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,400
Then there's 45 cents
rowboat-under-the-wharf tax,

42
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,240
and one dollar
leaving-your-junk-

43
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,720
lying-around-the-wharf tax.

44
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,760
So, all together,
you owe the Commodore

45
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,040
$1.87.

46
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,240
Ah, who's this Commodore?

47
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,080
That the nature of a question?

48
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,880
There's a nickel question tax.

49
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,760
Oh, forget it.
I see what you're up to here.

50
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,880
Here we go.

51
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,560
Exact change, please.

52
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,720
I'm an exact-change taxman.

53
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,800
Oh. Mmm. Here's a dollar.

54
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,720
Here's a red cent.

55
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,320
Here's a franc.

56
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,560
A peso.

57
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,960
Here's a guilder.

58
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,560
Oh, sorry I'm taking

59
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,160
your time.

60
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,320
There's a dime; there we go.

61
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,960
There's one quarter.

62
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,080
Curiosity tax.

63
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,600
Hey, I paid me tax.

64
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,680
Oh, tax this, tax that.

65
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,320
Ooh, my nightmare don't...

66
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,960
Mmm, I gets disgustipated.

67
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,520
"Have you paid your tax?"

68
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,240
I got it, I got it.

69
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,760
No, I-I got it.

70
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,640
I got it, I got it.

71
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,760
Don't worry, I got it.

72
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,760
Holy cow.

73
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,960
Looks like me old pipe.

74
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,360
Wonder what it's doing here?

75
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,200
What a coinkydink.

76
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,320
Hey! What is this?

77
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,480
This ain't the orchestra pit.

78
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,200
Oh, lookit there.

79
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,680
Nobody seems to care...

80
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,560
You've got so much
to bear, ma'am.

81
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,840
Can I...?

82
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,240
Blow me down!

83
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,960
That's it, that...!

84
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,560
Oh, it's the wind and air...

85
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,480
Just try to double dare
to... blow me down.

86
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,040
Awk! Wait for me!

87
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,720
Hello, there, mate.
Maybe, uh...

88
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,040
Ah, blow me down.

89
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,840
It's no bother, but...

90
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,360
Look over there...
stranger's coming.

91
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,680
You'd rather not, huh?

92
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,200
Well, that's easy to see.

93
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,840
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm

94
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,720
Wherever I go...

95
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,960
Ooh, nice-looking knees,

96
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,080
it does it for me.

97
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,400
Bad news!
Bad, bad, bad news.

98
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,040
Hmm, I don't believe that.

99
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,240
What a lovely day...

100
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,160
Well, it's still
a perfect day, but...

101
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,640
Oh, maybe ma'am,
you would like to...

102
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,360
Blow me down again, there.

103
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,960
It's a lovely place

104
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,640
Think I'd like to stay, but...

105
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,080
Stranger in town.

106
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,280
Blow me down.

107
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,080
Somebody roll into town?

108
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,120
Trouble, trouble,
trouble, trouble...

109
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,400
Blow me down...
local glum club.

110
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,080
It's friendly here...

111
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,200
A little scary, too.

112
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,680
I think I'll spend a year,

113
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,040
Or two, maybe thr...

114
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,000
Whoa, tut-tut-tut.

115
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,560
I yam what I yam,
wherever I go

116
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,360
I came from the sea...

117
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,040
Should've got me number,

118
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,680
but no one's looking it up,
ain't it?

119
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,240
Oh...

120
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,360
Good day... Good day.

121
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,480
I hate you to pieces!

122
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,040
Kind of a greasy good day,
but that's all right.

123
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,520
Bunch of carrotsk?

124
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,240
No, no.

125
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,560
You ain't got no carrotsk?

126
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,760
What are those, prunes?

127
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,120
Phooey on carrots!

128
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,000
Take broccoli.

129
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,160
I am in the mood for carrotsk.

130
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,640
I need me vitamins.

131
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,040
Phooey on carrots!

132
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,120
Take spinach!

133
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,680
If I wants spinach,
I'll axk you for spinach.

134
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,120
So, why you didn't say so?

135
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,360
For you, each a dollar.

136
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,680
How much is the broccoli?

137
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
Nickel, maybe dime.

138
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,840
And the spinach?

139
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,880
Dime, maybe quarter.

140
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,440
Then how come
carrotsk is a dollar?

141
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,480
Dollar fifty.

142
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,200
You buy what I don't feel
like selling,

143
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,240
it'll cost you $2.

144
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,320
All right, here you go.

145
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,920
Uh-uh-uh-uh!

146
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,560
Hey, deadbeat, this is a nickel.

147
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,240
I pays what I feels like paying.

148
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,480
You're not up to no good,
are you?

149
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,360
'Cause if you are, there's
a 50-cent up-to-no-good tax.

150
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,360
Come here! Come back!

151
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,520
Seems like everywhere

152
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,520
Lots of people here

153
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,480
Try to blow me down...

154
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,400
Unlike the clothes I wear

155
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,600
I haven't...

156
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,120
Careful, there.

157
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,160
What blew him into town?

158
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,160
Oh, the short arm of the law,
huh?

159
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,640
Blow me down

160
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,960
Blow me down...

161
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,720
Ow!

162
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,480
Hey, come ba... hey, hey... ah!

163
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,440
Uh, are you the piano tuner

164
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,760
or the man
with the party favor?

165
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,520
You got a room for renk?

166
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,760
What for what?

167
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,160
Renk, renk... your sign says you
got a room for renk.

168
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,560
Oh, my stars and gardens!

169
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,600
My mind was
a million miles away.

170
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,280
Come in before you catch
your death of mud.

171
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,760
"Mud."

172
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,040
"Oyls." That explains it.

173
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,600
She's down a quart.

174
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,600
Scums... I'll find you.

175
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,440
Come on, come on!

176
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,280
Mmm. Don't make them
like they used to.

177
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,440
Oh, come on.

178
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,160
Oh!

179
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,200
I'm sorry, Mother,
but it's ugly.

180
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,200
I ask you, have you ever
seen anything so ugly?

181
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,160
I won't be engaged
in this hat.

182
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,480
I heard that.

183
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,120
Don't think
I didn't hear that.

184
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,480
Oh...

185
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,000
She owes me an apology.

186
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,280
Oh... ugly.

187
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,400
There's nothing left to say.

188
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,800
What do you think?

189
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,080
I think it's up to you, dear.

190
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,880
Well, what do you think? Ugly.

191
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,440
I think it's a conspiracy.

192
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,800
Oh...

193
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,640
Why would they manufacture
deliberate ugliness

194
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,760
unless they wanted me
to look ugly?

195
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,560
If we find that out,
we find out everything.

196
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,080
There's a stranger
in t... um... ooh...

197
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,200
Oh...

198
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,400
I can't get engaged.

199
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,520
You'll have to tell
Bluto; I can't.

200
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,320
We'll have to cancel the party

201
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,440
tomorrow night.

202
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,960
It's not my fault
that it's so ugly.

203
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,160
What are you doing

204
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,760
listening in on
a private conversation

205
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,920
between me and my mother?

206
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,880
I have a good mind to have
my father call a policeman.

207
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,320
Olive, will you show
Mister... Mister...?

208
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,480
Oh. Popeye, ma'am.

209
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,720
...Mr. Eye

210
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,880
the spare room?

211
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,040
Just Popeye, ma'am.

212
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,040
Go upstairs, Mr. Eye.

213
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,240
Olive will show you the room.

214
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,200
Thanks.

215
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,720
Some kind of asylum here.

216
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,760
Show me a room.

217
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,000
Show me some courtesy

218
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,000
might be nice.

219
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,520
I don't see why
I have to do anything

220
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,000
on the day
before my engagement party

221
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,520
when nothing's ready,
especially me.

222
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,800
And what kind of name is that,
anyway... Popeye?

223
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,000
Pretty strange.

224
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,920
What kind of name is Olive Oyl?

225
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,120
Sounds like
some kind of lubricants.

226
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,520
Thank you very much, ma'am.

227
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,640
Don't look in that room;
that's my room.

228
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,120
Meant no disrespect there.

229
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,480
Ugly, huh?

230
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,320
You owe me an apology.

231
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,480
What?

232
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,320
Wonder who shoved
a feather in his ear?

233
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,320
What'd you say?

234
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,360
Sure is nice weather
you have here.

235
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,800
Your name really Olives?

236
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,160
So what?

237
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,160
Olives Oyl?

238
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,000
You don't look Greek to me.

239
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,200
So, you're short.

240
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,360
Or are you just passing
yourself off as short?

241
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,480
Can I see me room now?

242
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,400
Ooh, as if I cared.

243
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,240
Let me give you a hand there.

244
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,240
Maybe it needs a little oil.

245
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,240
Oh!

246
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,880
Oh, oh...

247
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,040
Nice-looking room.

248
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,560
Never seen a room done
in early demolish-kin before,

249
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,120
but this'll do for me.

250
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,360
Careful how you treat
that bed.

251
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,200
Nothing goes on this bed.

252
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,480
Sorry, ma'am, it's just some...

253
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,480
Watch that lamp!

254
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,480
Let me give you some assistance.

255
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,880
Here, give me your hand.

256
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,880
There, that's it.
Yeah, here we go.

257
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,080
Oh, you're in first.

258
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,800
Is that... oh...
Boy, is it hot in here.

259
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,280
I still respect you.

260
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,280
Ooh!

261
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,800
Me bad eye, didn't see that.

262
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,840
Hmph!

263
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,000
Thanks for your help.

264
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Uh, Miss Oyl, maybe...

265
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,440
Don't forget to put
the cat out, dear.

266
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,200
We don't have a cat.

267
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,520
Eau de toilette.

268
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,320
Yeah, eau de toilette.

269
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,680
Yeah.

270
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,880
How do you like that?

271
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,720
Gold is up 20 cents,
two dollars an ounce.

272
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,000
Out of my kitchen, Mr. Wimpy.

273
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,280
I knew it, I knew it, see...

274
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,600
You wait for the supper gong.

275
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,240
I could've made
a fortune on Billings

276
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,640
if Bluto would've let me go
directly to the Commodore.

277
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,680
He's so jealous of me,
that Bluto.

278
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,400
Well, who wouldn't be?

279
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,200
Me, I'm not jealous of Castor.

280
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,240
He's my son.

281
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,040
Man jealous of his own son.

282
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,600
You owe me an apology.

283
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,800
I didn't mean you.

284
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,520
Never lets me go
to the Commodore.

285
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,040
Commodore is a paragon
of sagacity.

286
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,440
If ever I could
put in a good word...

287
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,440
"Shut up" is the word.

288
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,960
"Pass" is another word
that Wimpy...

289
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,080
You don't pass.

290
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,800
He should be killed to death.

291
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,720
It says here the Commodore's
taxing salt again.

292
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,240
Don't look as good as I smell,
but too late now.

293
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,600
Got to go.

294
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:10,280
Oh, Mr. Eye,
have you met... uh, Pop?

295
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,760
Mr. Wimpy, my son Castor,

296
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,760
Mr. Geezil, my husband Cole.

297
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,920
We're all one big
happy family here.

298
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,920
- Hmph!
- Although not really.

299
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,920
I mean, well, Mr. Geezil
and Mr. Wimpy are, um...

300
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,240
Me, I'm family.

301
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,360
Well, you're my husband.

302
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,280
You owe me an apology.

303
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,760
Well, I can't find anything.

304
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,320
What are you
looking for, Olive?

305
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,880
- A glass.
- Oh, uh, here's a glass.

306
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,560
That's a short, fat, ugly glass.

307
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,080
I want a tall, pretty,
slender glass.

308
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,120
They're all broken.

309
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,280
I could've made a fortune

310
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,440
- in fish futures...
- Fish?

311
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,320
But I'd have to dip
into capital.

312
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,320
Fish futures smell.

313
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,760
What kind of glass
do you want, Olive?

314
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,760
A wine glass

315
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,600
or a brandy glass,
or a water glass?

316
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,400
Oh, not a thing...
I don't want a thing.

317
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,440
Real appetizing.

318
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,440
I want a fork.

319
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,560
Right beside your plate.

320
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,280
If it was a knife,
it would cut you.

321
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,560
- And a knife.
- Will you sit down?

322
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,280
Why don't I have a knife?
And a nice dress?

323
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,840
You owe me an apology.

324
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,560
Passing fish, please.

325
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,080
Fish, excellent idea, Miss Oyl.

326
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,000
I would suggest before
matrimony, fish.

327
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,080
Fish before matrimony.

328
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,120
Ooh, that does look good, there.

329
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,320
Wish I had a plate though.

330
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,120
...because four times
engaged is three times much.

331
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,480
Oh, he can't talk me out
of anything; I'm not a child.

332
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,760
I'll say you're not a child.

333
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,520
- Who says I'm not a child?
- You said you're not a child

334
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,600
and I agreed with you,
that's who.

335
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,640
Who asked you
to agree with me?

336
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,200
Well, no one can stop me
from agreeing with you

337
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,760
- if I want to.
- I can.

338
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,000
Quarreling at my table.

339
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,480
You both owe me an apology.

340
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,960
Sorry, Pop.

341
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,480
What?

342
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,640
Please pass the shrimp,

343
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,760
chicken and meatballs.

344
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,160
Well, I don't know.

345
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,160
Captain Bluto has
the patience of Job.

346
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,200
Or is it job?

347
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,960
Certainly got
a very good job, Job.

348
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,520
And he needs
a lot of patience.

349
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,640
Why, he runs this town
for the Commodore

350
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,640
while he's away.

351
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,120
And the Commodore's
always away.

352
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,960
As a matter of fact,
I've never seen him.

353
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,160
- Have you, Cole?
- What?

354
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,440
I'd never let a girl
break my engagement.

355
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,280
I'd break her nose before
she broke my engagement.

356
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,360
And you better not try on me
what you pulled on Bluto,

357
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,520
because I'm no pushover.

358
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,400
You owe your sister
an apology.

359
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,920
Will you stop fidgeting?

360
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,240
Finishing touch here.

361
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,120
Oh, this knife won't cut.

362
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,160
Here, take mine.

363
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,160
Not since I was child

364
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,920
have we had a sharp knife
in this house.

365
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,480
You owe me an apology.

366
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,960
You don't like our knives.

367
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,400
Bluto's rich, he can buy you
plenty of knives.

368
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,880
Ooh, I hate this table,
it's ugly.

369
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,320
I'm the only one
with nerve enough

370
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,480
to tell the truth about it.

371
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,560
Well, then, why don't you
let Bluto the pushover

372
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,560
buy you a new table?

373
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,560
- Am I right, Pop?
- Right.

374
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,560
I'm right, right?

375
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,560
- You're right.
- Right.

376
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,760
Nothing left?

377
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,600
Oh... Bluto, Bluto, Bluto.

378
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,400
Everyone takes advantage
of my poor Bluto.

379
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,560
Get a new... glass,
a new knife.

380
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,520
Now they want a table.
Well, hmph!

381
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,000
That's why I always
have to break off

382
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,320
our engagement...
to stop you all

383
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,880
from taking advantage
of the sweetest,

384
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,640
most humble man
on the face of this Earth!

385
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,640
Hmph.

386
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,720
Mmm.

387
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,280
You make me sick.

388
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,720
Never good to be too full,
I guess.

389
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,600
It's 9:00!

390
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,560
Curfew!

391
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,600
Lights... out!

392
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,640
You can have a kiss now.

393
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,160
Oh!

394
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,320
Poppa.

395
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,080
Pretty soon you and me

396
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,760
are going to be together again,
huh?

397
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,280
Yeah.

398
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,600
30 years ain't that long.

399
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,640
Besides, next Wednesday's
our annual-versity.

400
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,320
Yeah? Yeah.

401
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,720
Stay alive.

402
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,240
That's all I'm axskin you.

403
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,720
Good night, Poppa.

404
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,360
Aw...

405
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,360
There.

406
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,440
Sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep.

407
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,040
Sweep, sweep...

408
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,080
Hey-up!

409
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,240
Ah... whoop!

410
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,640
Eee-oh!

411
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,680
Everything
is food, food, food

412
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,160
Everything is food to go

413
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:51,280
Everything is food
for thought

414
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,480
Everything you knead
is dough

415
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,800
It is food

416
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,200
Everything is food

417
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,920
Everything is meat, meat, meat

418
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,480
Careful what you put
on your feet

419
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,320
Once it lived on an ani-mule

420
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,760
Now it walks along with you

421
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,480
It could be food

422
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,320
Everything is food

423
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,200
I would gladly pay you Tuesday
for a hamburger today

424
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,840
He would gladly pay you
Tuesday for a hamburger today

425
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,720
Everything is
chow, chow, chow

426
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,960
Everything is food to go now

427
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,720
Everything is
fast-food chains

428
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,560
From your lemon
to your sugarcane

429
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,080
It is food

430
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,520
Everything is food

431
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,400
Did you order a hamburger?

432
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,800
Yeah, I ordered a hamburger.

433
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,280
That's what I got,
a hamburger.

434
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,280
No, I beg to disagree.

435
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,520
Rough House,
a genuine hamburger

436
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,520
for the gentleman.

437
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,760
- I'm buying.
- Hey, thanks.

438
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,080
Who's paying?

439
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,400
I'm buying, he's paying.

440
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,920
A nickel hamburger tax?

441
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,560
I'd refuse to pay
if I were you.

442
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,920
A shocking abuse of power.

443
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,280
Rough House!

444
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,320
Food, food, food

445
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,760
Everything is food

446
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,400
One hamburger-chiseler's tax.

447
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,000
I would gladly
pay you Tuesday

448
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,040
- What kind mooch is this?
- For a hamburger today

449
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:01,440
He would gladly pay you
Tuesday for a hamburger today

450
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,960
Everything is upside-down

451
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,960
Everything is sunny-side up

452
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,080
Did you pay for this

453
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,080
In American?

454
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,160
They can't trick us
with no hot dog

455
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:26,120
Everything is food,
food, food

456
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,560
Everything is food.

457
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,040
Hey, hey, hey, Laverne!

458
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,120
Give us a smooch!

459
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,480
I really need someone
to kind of talk to,

460
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,800
'cause I thought everybody
in this town might be deef.

461
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,800
Huh, what's that?

462
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,800
Huh? Oh.

463
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,440
You know, jusk why
I'm here is...

464
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,680
I'm looking for me pap.

465
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,680
Yeah, oh...

466
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,440
I've searched
the seven seas for him,

467
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,240
and I haven't found him yet.

468
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,480
I was only two years old,
me own pap left me.

469
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,240
I was just a mere infink.

470
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,640
Me own pap...

471
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,080
Pipe down, will ya?

472
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,360
Me own pap ditches me.

473
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,520
I'm a very tolerant man,

474
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,560
except when it comes
to holding a grudge.

475
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,720
I never thought
I'd forgive me paps,

476
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,240
but about seven years ago,

477
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,880
I ships out on this boat,
The Gloomy Gus.

478
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,640
That's a boat. Yeah.

479
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,400
Just off the coast of Guam.

480
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,000
It breaks up on this typhoon,

481
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,200
and I'm stuck on
this raft for 45 days

482
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,480
without food or waters.

483
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,200
But after all
this time on this raft,

484
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,280
this visiktation comes to me.

485
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:45,120
Looks just like me mother,
rest her soul.

486
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,320
And it says,
"Your pap is still alive."

487
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,280
Excuse me.

488
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,800
So, when I was finally rescued,

489
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,360
I figured out that I got
to forgive me paps, you know?

490
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,440
Uh, you see,

491
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,000
I'm only afeared
that he might be dead,

492
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,280
and never realize what a
fine figure of an orphink

493
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,640
I turned out to be.

494
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,920
You sure got a nice-looking
face there,

495
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,880
One-Eye.

496
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,040
One-Eye?

497
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,040
I've seen better arms
on a baboon.

498
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,800
You're a slimy...

499
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,360
Yeah, you want to know
why you're so "lonescome,"

500
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,880
go take a look at that mirror.

501
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,000
You know, if there's
one thing I ain't got,

502
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,560
it's a sense ka humor.

503
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,080
Where did you get that,
uh, pronunskiation?

504
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,640
Yeah? Got an olive
caught in your throat?

505
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,120
Well, yeah, well,
I'll get back to you.

506
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,480
Pappy.

507
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,640
His Dada.

508
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,240
No. I want my Dada.

509
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,560
Hey, if I were your daddy,

510
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,720
I'd ship out, too.

511
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,280
Yeah. You're too dumb-looking

512
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,400
to leave on a doorstep.

513
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,440
Hey, runt...

514
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,520
I'll bet your pappy...

515
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,200
is as ugly as you are.

516
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,400
Another thing I got...

517
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,440
is a sensk of humiligration.

518
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,880
Now, uh, maybe you swabs can,
uh, pool your intelligence

519
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:42,000
and sees that I'm asking you
for an apologiky.

520
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,400
Hey, Butch,

521
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,680

522
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,200
an apology?

523
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,920
With pleasure, Spike.

524
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,000
The little one-eyed rat
wants an apology.

525
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,320
Well, I would like
to offer my most sincere

526
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,560
and hum-felt apologies.

527
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,760
You got it.

528
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,280
That's so low...
picking on innocents.

529
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,360
You apologize?

530
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,240
Do you apologize?

531
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,440
I-I apologize.

532
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,640
Rosie, get my hat.

533
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,000
I think
it's time we leave. I...

534
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,120
back to the dairy...

535
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,880
- Apologize.
- For what?

536
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,000
All these innocents.

537
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,040
This is a smorgasbord
of violence.

538
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,440
Well, that's everybody.

539
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,800
Everybody's apologized.

540
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,760
Yeah, everybody's really sorry.

541
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,960
Oh, everybody's really,

542
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,920
really sorry.

543
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,120
Now it's your turn

544
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,480
to be sorry.

545
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,520
Oh, yeah.

546
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,080
I'm sorry to have to do this,
but enough is enough.

547
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,680
Hey.

548
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,640
Come on.

549
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,680
Come on.

550
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,720
Hey, hey, hey!

551
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,960
Hey, hey, hey.

552
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,400
Sorry.

553
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,280
Thanks.

554
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,280
Anybody else want
to apologygy?

555
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,760
All in a day's fun, ain't it?

556
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,280
I dare you.

557
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,400
Nobody home?

558
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,040
There you go.

559
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,760
Sorry about that.

560
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,000
No. Keep the change.

561
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,480
Remember, my dear,

562
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,280
tonight it's my turn
to be tall.

563
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,320
Oh.

564
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,680
Very nice party.

565
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,120
I can't help but feel sad,
though.

566
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,280
Chico?

567
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,880
This is a sad day for me.

568
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,680
Chico, hand these things out.

569
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,080
It's one of the saddest days
of my life.

570
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,240
Flowers.

571
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,480
I forgot the flowers.

572
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,440
Yup.

573
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,600
Oh, disillusionkand.

574
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,640
Oh, look at that.

575
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,960
Oh, me dress blues.

576
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,280
This is Castor's
favorite color.

577
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,320
Oh, you and Castor.

578
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,640
Oh, phooey.

579
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,000
Oh, hello there, Cousin.

580
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,840
We're just waiting
for Captain Bluto.

581
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,840
Oh, I can't tell you
how happy this makes me

582
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,160
to attend Miss Oyl's parties.

583
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,360
Uh, nice-looking furs there.

584
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,880
Hmm?

585
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,080
Oh.

586
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,440
Boy, uh, I don't know
when I've had this much fun

587
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,480
and still been conskious.

588
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,240
Well... I better be on me way.

589
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,720
Oh, reservoir.

590
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,600
Not really as nice as ours.

591
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,520
But he's so big.

592
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,640
I really...

593
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,960
Typical smutty sailor comment.

594
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Sailor...

595
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,840
Oh, I don't want
to go to no party.

596
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,840
Well, that's good,
'cause you ain't invited.

597
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,200
Who says I ain't invited?

598
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,560
I says.
Who are you?

599
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,680
You know who I am.
I'm you.

600
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:48,600
Don't drain your sense
of dignity... is that it?

601
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,920
Nah.

602
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,040
Ugly.

603
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,760
Bluto's ugly all right.

604
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,120
Bluto's distinguished.

605
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,440
He's distinguished, all right.

606
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,800
Distinguishingly ugly.

607
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,280
Bluto's special.

608
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,920
Oh, he's special, all right.

609
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,280
Especially ugly.

610
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,680
He's tall

611
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,360
Good-looking

612
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,600
And he's large

613
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,240
He's large

614
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,560
Large

615
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,880
Tall

616
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,120
Large...

617
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,960
Good morning, Captain Bluto.

618
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,240
I... I mean...

619
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,480
Good evening, Captain Bluto.

620
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,960
I mean...

621
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
And he's mine

622
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,080
Not a mandolin

623
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,480
Oh, no

624
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,480
He's an accordion

625
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:12,120
I have to squeeze him
each night to keep him warm

626
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:16,520
Warm

627
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,720
Oh, boy

628
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,240
He's virile

629
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,960
And he's strong

630
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,680
- Strong
- Strong

631
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,800
- Strong

632
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,960
He's strong

633
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,840
Strong...

634
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,280
Uh...

635
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,480
Sounds like Fluto.

636
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,680
Bluto.

637
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,960
Bluto.

638
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,960
At your services, sir.

639
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,760
There's a good picture
in the paper this week.

640
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,760
A lovely present for you

641
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,200
down at the pawn shop,
Captain Bluto.

642
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,960
I would have brought it,
but it was too late.

643
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,160
Anytime you want me to come by

644
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,160
and stain up the boat,
Captain Bluto.

645
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,840
Mother!

646
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:54,120
He's got money and respect

647
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,480
That's true

648
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:00,360
He's better than the rest

649
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,080
That's true

650
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:06,600
He may not be the best

651
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,040
But he's large

652
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,400
And he's mine...

653
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,640
She can have him.

654
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,800
Yeah.

655
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,440
She loves me.

656
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,480
Of course she does.

657
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,320
She don't love me.

658
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,480
Oh, no.

659
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,600
She'll marry me.

660
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,640
Large

661
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,640
Large

662
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,400
Large

663
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,400
Large

664
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,520
Mine

665
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,440
Mine

666
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,040
Mine

667
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,240
Mine...

668
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,200
She won't marry me.

669
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,200
Oh.

670
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,040
She will.

671
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,200
She won't.

672
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:13,040
It may seem funny,
but it's not

673
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,800
Oh, no

674
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,360
I'm thankful

675
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,440
For what I've got

676
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,680
Me, too

677
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,680
It may not be a lot

678
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:30,440
But he's large.

679
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,600
She will.

680
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,360
Yes, yes.

681
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,400
She...

682
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,200
Faulty flower...
C-Captain Bluto.

683
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,640
Mrs. Oyl, Olive's...

684
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,640
Olive's what?

685
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,160
Olive's...

686
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,000
...getting ready.

687
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,000
Good.

688
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,160
Now, where were we?

689
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,520
Uh, she won't
marry you, she...

690
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,040
She will!

691
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,960
Oh, my word!

692
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,440
Son-in-law.

693
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,720
Oh, yeah, yeah.

694
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,920
Ah! Ooh.

695
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,960
Olive!

696
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,000
Marvelous, marvelous.

697
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,640
No place to go.

698
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,680
Can't go to no party
without an invite.

699
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,720
Whoo!

700
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,000
- Ho, ho, ho, whoa.
- Whoo! Ooh.

701
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,320
- Miss Oyl.
- Oh...

702
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,560
You scared the wits out of me.

703
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,400
Yeah, I almost knocked 'em
out of you, too.

704
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,000
- Sorry I did that to you.
- What right do you have

705
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,840
to lurk here in the dark
in the middle of the night

706
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,160
and scare the wits
out of a person?

707
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,000
I wasn't.
I was just, uh, kind of, uh...

708
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,000
Oh, oh.

709
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,840
How's your party going,
Miss Oyl?

710
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,680
- Oh, that's a dumb question.
- Yeah.

711
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,000
Where do you think I'm headed
right this minute?

712
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,400
Um... well, uh,

713
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,680
mmm, that way, I think.

714
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,680
Out of town.

715
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,280
- I am not headed out of town.
- Oh.

716
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,480
Don't you see which
direction I'm facing?

717
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,240
- You're going, now you're...
- Oh, ooh, whoa.

718
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,320
- Now you're facing east.
- Oh.

719
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,480
Maybe a little southwest.

720
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,680
- Place your bets.
- Oh. Oh!

721
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,840
You need some help with
your bags there, Miss Oyl?

722
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,240
- Ooh, oh, no.
- I didn't touch ya.

723
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,360
I didn't mean to hurt ya.

724
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,560
Thank you.

725
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,040
- Oh, you do.
- Oh.

726
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,800
Oh.

727
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,800
No, that's the wrong way.

728
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,840
Oh.

729
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,800
No, that's the wrong way.

730
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,320
I want to go...

731
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,080
Oh...

732
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,560
Oh, oh...

733
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,480
Whoo! Oh. Oh, oh.

734
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,680
Oh!

735
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,800
Oh, oh...

736
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,800
Oh...

737
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,960
That way.

738
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
That'll be 50 cents

739
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,320
impersonating-a-traffic-cop tax.

740
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,320
What?

741
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,600
Oh.

742
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,800
I'm sorry, Miss Oyl.

743
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,120
Didn't recognize you
from the back.

744
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,000
It won't happen again.

745
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,240
How come Miss Oyl
don't have to pay no taxes?

746
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,600
That's ten cents question tax.

747
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,720
But... I'll let you off
this time

748
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,640
since you're with Miss Oyl.

749
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,160
Good night, Miss Oyl.

750
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,680
Well, how come being
with Miss Oyl

751
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,000
means I don't have
to pay no...

752
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,360
...taxes?

753
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,040
Well, I don't know
what you're talking about.

754
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:01,120
Here's a nice cup of tea
for you, Captain Bluto,

755
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,480
while you're waiting.

756
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:11,000
Where's Olive?

757
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,400
Olive?

758
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,640
You think everyone pays taxes

759
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,400
but me and my family,
don't you? Mm-hmm.

760
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,800
Well, you couldn't be
more wrong.

761
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,360
If I'm wrong, why
am I in the right?

762
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,240
You think it's because
I'm engaged to Bluto

763
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,000
and Bluto runs the town
for the Commodore

764
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,120
so we get special favors.

765
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,240
Well, it's a lie. Hmm.

766
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,840
Olive!

767
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,400
Bluto is kind and generous

768
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,600
and likes to do things
for his loved ones.

769
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,480
And you want me to
hurt his feelings.

770
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,800
Well, phooey on you.

771
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,960
Hmm. You don't even care
enough about me or my family

772
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,520
to be at my engagement party.

773
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,400
And what are you doing here
in Sweethaven anyway, hmm?

774
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,320
Well, I'm-I'm looking
for me pap.

775
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,480
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

776
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,600
Oh, well, if that's true,
then where is he?

777
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,800
Well, yeah, um, got me there.

778
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,320
I don't really know.

779
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,000
I... I got this sense

780
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,760
that he's here though,
you know?

781
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,840
Oh, well, all right,
I'll wait. Hmm.

782
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,360
Anyway, there are too
many guests as it is.

783
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,520
Half of them I hate.

784
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,360
One thing I remember
about me pap

785
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,880
was that he always used
to throw me up in the air.

786
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,600
But he'd never be there
when I come down, you know.

787
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,880
- Heh, heh, heh.
- Mmm.

788
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,800
Boy, he had a sense ka humor,
didn't he?

789
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,040
Yeah, that was me pap.

790
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,840
I remember that time
he gave me

791
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,360
an electric eel as a toy.

792
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,560
Eep!

793
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,880
Yeah, that was fun.

794
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,040
Or he'd rock me in my cradle

795
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,040
real, real, real hard
and I'd lose me formula.

796
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,560
And then he'd say, "One
day, you'll be a sailor."

797
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,280
That... that's what
I am today.

798
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,200
Yeah. Sometimes,
he'd bounce me on his knee.

799
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,080
Most of the time
he'd miss, though

800
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,520
'cause he couldn't see
too well with one eye.

801
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,320
Oh, me pap, yeah.

802
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,680
Well, I'm not waiting
any longer. Hmm.

803
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,480
Oh, sorry, Miss Oyl.

804
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,840
I was philoscofying.

805
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,160
Mm-hmm.

806
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,200
...between us, got kind of
derailed and...

807
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,160
Oh, yeah, long time waiting.

808
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,840
Wait a while...

809
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,480
What are you doing
with that basket?

810
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,200
Well, I-I'm carrying it.

811
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,200
It's your basket, ain't it?

812
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,360
It is not my basket.

813
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,880
Somebody has deliberately
painted that basket

814
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,280
to look like my basket.

815
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,160
My basket was clean
and beautiful

816
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,600
and this basket is ugly.

817
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,320
- Rattlesnake!
- Miss Oyl, we should at least

818
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,720
have dinner first,
or something.

819
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,760
Rattlesnake!
Rattlesnake!

820
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,200
Oh, rattlesnake!
Ooh! Oh, oh, oh!

821
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,960
Rattlesnakes?
Where is it, Miss Oyl?

822
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:39,560
Where is it?

823
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,720
Oh, oh, rattlesnake, oh!

824
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,880
Don't worry, Miss Oyl,

825
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,040
I've handled vermins before.

826
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,000
I'll rattle that snakes
so it's a pair of shoes.

827
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,040
Rattlesnake!
Rattlesnake!

828
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,440
I'll rattle that...

829
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,800
- I'll rattle him upside-down.

1000
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,640
Aah, phooey, the Commodore.

1001
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,880
Next to Wimpy,
I hate him best.

1002
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,800
"You owe..."
This is extremely grave news.

1003
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,360
Please, pay attention.

1004
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,720
"...the sum of twelve thousand,
twelve hundred,

twelve dollars

1006
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,760
Cole, stop reading!

1007
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:51,920
Plus one sunflower-
embarrassing-the-taxman tax.

1008
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,560
Phooey!

1009
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,320
And double phooey!

1010
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,400
Avast there. Avast.

1011
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,880
Watch it, you'll hurt her.

1012
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,360
Oh, yeah?
A lot you know.

1013
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,520
Her is a him.
See, it likes to smoke.

1014
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,960
So... you're just a landlubber,
ain't ya?

1015
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,560
Oh, yeah, well, I'm a woman.

1016
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,360
Oh, yeah, well, I am a mudder.

1017
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,360
Oh, yeah?

1018
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,800
Come here.

1019
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,040
- Papa.
- Oh, yeah?

1020
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,840
He wants me,
he wants me there.

1021
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,880
You must have an IQ about
half a million, don't ya?

1022
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,160
Oh, yeah, coochie-coo.

1023
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,360
None of that baby talk
around me son.

1024
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,520
Me son's gonna be a man
and not a baby, I'm thinking.

1025
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:25,880
Ain't that right?

1026
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,280
Oh, come to Papa,
me little Swee'pea.

1027
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:31,280
You're my little Swee'pea,
you're my little Swee'pea.

1028
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,680
- Swee'pea?
- Mm-hmm.

1029
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,880
- You're bats.
- Oh, yeah?

1030
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,480
I found him in Sweethaven.
That is why he's me Swee'pea.

1031
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,720
I am calling him Swee'pea,
and that is his name.

1032
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:39,720
Ain't that the truth?

1033
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,720
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

1034
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,320
Well, Swee'pea is
about the worst name

1035
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,400
I ever heard on a baby.

1036
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,520
Well, what do you want me
to call him? Baby Oyl?

1037
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,760
Excuse me.

1038
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,040
Excuse me. Excuse me, please.

1039
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,800
A bit of boxing tonight.

1040
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,640
What could happen to me?

1041
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,800
Well, I could get killed.

1042
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:27,320
It'd be worth getting killed
to help Mom and Pop.

1043
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,280
What if I won?

1044
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,560
I'm fast, I'm foxy.

1045
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,080
He could have a heart attack.

1046
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:51,680
Sweet Sweethaven

1047
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:57,360
God must love us...

1048
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,320
Ooh, and I disapprove of you

1049
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,560
taking me to a fight

1050
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:01,880
and my parents to a fight

1051
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,200
and my baby to a fight.

1052
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,440
Ah, Sweethaven...

1053
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,840
Fights is fun.

1054
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,920
Oh, fights are not fun.

1055
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,400
Know the words
for this song, Cole?

1056
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,920
Of course I know the words.

1057
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,680
It's our national anthem,
isn't it?

1058
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,880
Pardon us...

1059
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:26,720
Ah-ah-ah.
That'll be 62 cents...

1060
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,040
going-to-an-illegal-
sporting-event tax.

1061
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,520
If it's illegal,
how come it's going on?

1062
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,400
Ladies and gentlemen!

1063
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,840
Citizens of Sweethaven...

1064
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,920
Popcorn!

1065
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,400
Be careful...

1066
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,360
Ooh, watch that step.

1067
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,640
Wait a minute.

1068
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,640
They're having a lover's quarrel
in front of us.

1069
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,640
That unworthiest
of worthies...

1070
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,040
the pejorator of...

1071
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,480
Fight stuff.

1072
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,480
Fight stuff!

1073
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,800
Now, look at that.
Isn't that...?

1074
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:01,880
Wait a minute.

1075
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,200
Yeah... right there,
right there is Castor.

1076
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,200
Castor!

1077
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,320
Oh, my son! Castor!

1078
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,240
Make a man outta yourself.

1079
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,000
Mom, Pop, I'm gonna fight him.

1080
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,000
Whoops.

1081
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:13,240
Don't go!

1082
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,280
Oh, it's my baby.

1083
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,400
Get out...
Get my baby outta there!

1084
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,720
Don't touch his feet!

1085
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,800
He's gotta dance
with those feet.

1086
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,320
Castor, we go home now.

1087
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,640
Olive,
do something about this.

1088
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,640
What are you, a nut?

1089
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:29,760
What good are you, Olive?

1090
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,760
You get in there and get your
brother out of this!

1091
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,080
I can't stand
much more of this.

1092
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,920
Where are my pills?

1093
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Don't do this!

1094
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,920
Mr. Geezil,
get him outta there, Geezil!

1095
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,840
Gentlemen, you know the rules:

1096
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,040
There are no rules.

1097
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,960
This is a fight to the finish.

1098
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,680
First man who is dead, loses.

1099
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,080
Good luck to both of you.

1100
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,560
Did you see what he was doing?!

1101
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,240
- You didn't see?!
- Good luck to you.

1102
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,240
I hate you to pieces!

1103
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:53,520
All right, come over here.

1104
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,440
Now don't, don't kill him.

1105
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,160
Just fluff him up a bit.

1106
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,000
You'll be leading
with the left hand.

1107
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:07,000
Castor! Castor,
get outta there!

1108
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,480
Go for him, right away, son.

1109
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,960
Come on, Castor.

1110
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,720
Give him Oyl, Castor!

1111
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,040
Give him Oyl!

1112
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,600
Come on, hit him,
hit him, hit him...!

1113
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:30,920
Hang him!

1114
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,240
Come on, Castor.

1115
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,760
Come on, knock him.

1116
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,840
Oh!

1117
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,880
...three, four, five, six...

1118
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:42,920
Get up!

1119
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,920
Your name's Castor,
not Custer.

1120
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,440
Come on, sting that whale!

1121
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,280
Don't make him mad, Castor.

1122
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:51,640
He's not a person!

1123
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:52,800
Hi. I'm, uh... Cas...

1124
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:56,440
That's it!
Come on, that's it.

1125
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,400
Kick him!

1126
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,200
Didn't you see that?

1127
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,600
Hey, ya bum!
You're a bum.

1128
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,560
I'll teaches ya
how to fight fair.

1129
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,880
He's not a person!

1130
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,200
One, two, three...

1131
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,800
Oh, hello. Very good.
Very good fight.

1132
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,040
...five...
- Up, up, up!

1133
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:17,320
Ya outta get taught
how to fight.

1134
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,360
I got your numbers!

1135
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,480
Ya beached whale.

1136
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,680
- I'm gonna teach ya...
- No, no, no!

1137
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,680
No!

1138
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,280
Oh. Popeye!

1139
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,160
Watch out now, Mr. Oxmeat!

1140
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,520
You, you, you!

1141
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,760
You're gonna be
kissing canvas real soon.

1142
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,160
Oh! Oh!

1143
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,120
Poor little fatherless baby.

1144
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,400
Oh, you'll be murdered.

1145
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,480
All right, gentlemen,
you both know the rules.

1146
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,160
This is to be a fight
to the finish.

1147
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,600
Touch gloves
and come out fighting.

1148
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,600
What are you afraid of?

1149
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:08,960
I got a magnet in
there or something?

1150
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,720
Come on!

1151
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,240
You scums.
I know who you...

1152
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,240
That was dirty.

1153
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,760
Little birdies... I think
you're gonna be seeing

1154
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,360
- real soon.
- Be right back, Mom.

1155
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,600
I know you will, sonny.

1156
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,360
All right, here we go.

1157
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,880
Now, what were we thinking

1158
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,520
what was before half thing

1159
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,480
on winning ahead
with your mind?

1160
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,360
Give him a karate chop!

1161
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,920
Very good.

1162
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,920
Fist... that's fighting.

1163
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,160
You can take him!

1164
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,240
Don't you dare!

1165
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,600
- Hey, your mudder's here?
- So what?

1166
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,640
- You bet I'm his mother.
- Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

1167
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,680
I'm a mudder meself.

1168
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,280
That's his mudder;
I can't bust him...

1169
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:03,320
You see?

1170
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,680
You're letting his
mother's be distracting you.

1171
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:06,880
Not be doing that.

1172
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:08,120
That kid...

1173
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,160
You don't bust him,
he kill you, right?

1174
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,160
Yeah, I got it.

1175
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,120
Now listen.
Dancing, dancing, dancing.

1176
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,360
Dancing, dancing.
Dancing legs.

1177
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,720
Be careful.

1178
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:21,480
Come on, sailor, fight!

1179
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,480
Oh, yeah. Watch it!

1180
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,200
To the left. To the right.
Look out.

1181
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,880
Easy! Easy!
Watch what you're doing.

1182
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,920
Popeye!

1183
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,040
Oh, be careful.

1184
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,120
Be careful.

1185
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:36,760
There.

1186
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:37,680
I gotta ask you...

1187
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:39,640
get your mudders...
outta the ring.

1188
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:40,640
Oh, oh.

1189
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,320
The bucket.

1190
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,160
Watch it! Watch it!
She's got a bucket!

1191
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,080
Oh, Mommy! I'm sorry.

1192
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,920
Oh, I'm sorry.
Where do I send the flowers?

1193
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,320
That's it. Come on!

1194
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,200
Give him the old one-two!

1195
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,120
That's one.

1196
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:18,120
That's two...
and three for me.

1197
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,880
Timber.
