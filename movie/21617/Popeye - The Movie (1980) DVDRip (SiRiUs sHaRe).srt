00:00:-6,-766 --> 00:00:-3,-330
Hey, what's this,
one of Bluto's tricks?

2
00:00:-3,-295 --> 00:00:-1,-270
l'm in the wrong movie.

3
00:02:17,912 --> 00:02:23,748
Sweet Sweethaven

4
00:02:23,785 --> 00:02:29,781
God must love us

5
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:35,524
We the people

7
00:02:40,802 --> 00:02:46,741
Hooray, hooray, Sweethaven

00:02:46,808 --> 00:02:52,576
Flags are wavin'

9
00:02:52,614 --> 00:02:55,082
We're people from the sea

10
00:02:55,116 --> 00:02:58,085
Safe from democracy

11
00:02:58,119 --> 00:03:00,883
Sweeter than a melon tree

12
00:03:00,922 --> 00:03:03,550
Put here for you and me

13
00:03:06,594 --> 00:03:09,995

14
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:15,628
Sweet Sweethaven

15
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:21,336
God must love us

16
00:03:21,376 --> 00:03:26,336
We the people

17
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:30,681
Of Sweethaven

18
00:03:47,001 --> 00:03:49,993
God must have landed here

19
00:03:50,038 --> 00:03:52,700
Why else
would he strand us here?

20
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,709
Where the air
is nice and clear

21
00:03:55,743 --> 00:03:58,007
Sweethaven
even sounds so near

22
00:03:58,046 --> 00:04:01,345
To Heaven

23
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:11,257
God will always bless
Sweethaven

24
00:04:15,897 --> 00:04:22,632
God will always
bless Sweethaven

25
00:04:26,574 --> 00:04:34,174
God will always bless
Sweethaven.

26
00:04:53,935 --> 00:04:55,402
You just dock?

27

-l have.
-Uh-huh.

28
00:04:56,638 --> 00:04:58,435
There'll be 25 cents
docking tax.

29
00:04:58,473 --> 00:04:59,872
What for?

30
00:04:59,907 --> 00:05:01,670
Where's your seacraft?

31
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:02,733
lt ain't no seacraft.

32
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,573
lt's me dinghy,
and it's under the wharf.

33
00:05:04,612 --> 00:05:05,670
Aha. Ah, huh.

34
00:05:05,713 --> 00:05:06,737
This your goods?

35
00:05:06,781 --> 00:05:07,975
-They is.
-Yeah?

36
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,449
You're new in town, right?

37
00:05:09,484 --> 00:05:11,577
You call this a town?

38
00:05:11,619 --> 00:05:12,745
Yeah.

39
00:05:12,787 --> 00:05:13,947
Well, first of all,

40
00:05:13,988 --> 00:05:15,717
there's 1 7 cents
new-in-town tax.

41
00:05:15,757 --> 00:05:18,419
Then there's 45 cents

42
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:20,222

lying-around-the-wharf tax.

44
00:05:21,763 --> 00:05:23,754
So, all together,
you owe the Commodore

45
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:25,059
$1 .87.

46
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:26,259
Ah, who's this Commodore?

47
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,063
That the nature of a question?

48
00:05:28,102 --> 00:05:29,899
There's a nickel question tax.

49
00:05:29,937 --> 00:05:31,768
Oh, forget it.
l see what you're up to here.

50
00:05:31,806 --> 00:05:32,864
Here we go.

51
00:05:32,907 --> 00:05:34,568
Exact change, please.

52
00:05:34,609 --> 00:05:36,702
l'm an exact-change taxman.

53
00:05:36,778 --> 00:05:38,803
Oh. Mmm. Here's a dollar.

54
00:05:38,846 --> 00:05:41,713
Here's a red cent.

55
00:05:41,783 --> 00:05:43,307
Here's a franc.

56
00:05:43,351 --> 00:05:44,579
A peso.

57
00:05:44,619 --> 00:05:45,950
Here's a guilder.

58
00:05:45,987 --> 00:05:47,579
Oh, sorry l'm taking

59
00:05:47,622 --> 00:05:49,146

60
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,317
There's a dime; there we go.

61
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:52,951
There's one quarter.

62
00:05:52,994 --> 00:05:54,086
Curiosity tax.

63
00:05:54,128 --> 00:05:55,618
Hey, l paid me tax.

64
00:06:00,601 --> 00:06:03,695
Oh, tax this, tax that.

65
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,330
Ooh, my nightmare don't...

66
00:06:05,373 --> 00:06:06,965
Mmm, l gets disgustipated.

67
00:06:07,008 --> 00:06:08,532
''Have you paid your tax?''

68
00:06:10,445 --> 00:06:12,242
l got it, l got it.

69
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,747
No, l-l got it.

70
00:06:13,848 --> 00:06:15,645
l got it, l got it.

71
00:06:15,683 --> 00:06:17,742
Don't worry, l got it.

72
00:06:17,785 --> 00:06:19,753
Holy cow.

73
00:06:19,854 --> 00:06:20,946
Looks like me old pipe.

74
00:06:20,988 --> 00:06:22,353
Wonder what it's doing here?

75
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,188
What a coinkydink.

76
00:06:29,997 --> 00:06:31,328
Hey! What is this?

77
00:06:31,365 --> 00:06:33,492
This ain't the orchestra pit.

78
00:06:50,084 --> 00:06:51,210
Oh, lookit there.

79
00:06:51,252 --> 00:06:52,685
Nobody seems to care...

80
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,551
You've got so much
to bear, ma'am.

81
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:55,851
Can l...?

82
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,222
Blow me down!

83
00:06:58,259 --> 00:06:59,954
That's it, that... !

84
00:06:59,994 --> 00:07:02,554
Oh, it's the wind and air...

85
00:07:02,597 --> 00:07:06,465
Just try to double dare
to... blow me down.

86
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:08,059
Awk! Wait for me!

87
00:07:08,102 --> 00:07:09,729
Hello, there, mate.
Maybe, uh...

88
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:13,029
Ah, blow me down.

89
00:07:13,074 --> 00:07:14,837
lt's no bother, but...

90
00:07:14,876 --> 00:07:16,343
Look over there--
stranger's coming.

91
00:07:16,377 --> 00:07:17,674
You'd rather not, huh?

92
00:07:17,712 --> 00:07:19,202
Well, that's easy to see.

93
00:07:19,247 --> 00:07:20,839
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm

94
00:07:20,882 --> 00:07:22,713
Wherever l go...

95
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,980
Ooh, nice-looking knees,

96
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:27,078
it does it for me.

97
00:07:27,121 --> 00:07:28,418
Bad news!
Bad, bad, bad news.

98
00:07:28,456 --> 00:07:30,048
Hmm, l don't believe that.

99
00:07:30,091 --> 00:07:31,251
What a lovely day...

100
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:33,157
Well, it's still
a perfect day, but...

101
00:07:33,194 --> 00:07:35,628
Oh, maybe ma'am,
you would like to...

102
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,358
Blow me down again, there.

103
00:07:37,398 --> 00:07:38,956
lt's a lovely place

104
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,628
Think l'd like to stay, but...

105
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,068
Stranger in town.

106
00:07:43,104 --> 00:07:44,298
Blow me down.

107
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,067
Somebody roll into town?

108
00:07:46,107 --> 00:07:49,133
Trouble, trouble,
trouble, trouble...

109
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,407
Blow me down--
local glum club.

110
00:07:51,445 --> 00:07:53,072
lt's friendly here...

111
00:07:53,114 --> 00:07:54,206
A little scary, too.

112
00:07:54,248 --> 00:07:55,681
l think l'll spend a year,

113
00:07:55,716 --> 00:07:57,047
Or two, maybe thr...

114
00:07:57,084 --> 00:07:58,984
Whoa, tut-tut-tut.

115
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:03,548
l yam what l yam,
wherever l go

116
00:08:03,591 --> 00:08:06,355
l came from the sea...

117
00:08:06,394 --> 00:08:08,055
Should've got me number,

118
00:08:08,095 --> 00:08:10,689
but no one's looking it up,
ain't it?

119
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,224
Oh...

120
00:08:13,267 --> 00:08:14,359
Good day. . . Good day.

121
00:08:14,402 --> 00:08:15,460
l hate you to pieces!

122
00:08:15,503 --> 00:08:18,028
Kind of a greasy good day,
but that's all right.

123
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,507
Bunch of carrotsk?

124
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,239
No, no.

125
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,541
You ain't got no carrotsk?

126
00:08:26,581 --> 00:08:27,741
What are those, prunes?

127
00:08:27,782 --> 00:08:29,113
Phooey on carrots!

128
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,015
Take broccoli.

129
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,179
l am in the mood for carrotsk.

130
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,620
l need me vitamins.

131
00:08:34,655 --> 00:08:36,054
Phooey on carrots!

132
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,114
Take spinach!

133
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:39,683
lf l wants spinach,
l'll axk you for spinach.

134
00:08:39,794 --> 00:08:42,126
So, why you didn't say so?

135
00:08:42,163 --> 00:08:44,358
For you, each a dollar.

136
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:45,695
How much is the broccoli?

137
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:46,700
Nickel, maybe dime.

138
00:08:46,801 --> 00:08:47,825
And the spinach?

139
00:08:47,869 --> 00:08:48,893
Dime, maybe quarter.

140
00:08:48,936 --> 00:08:50,426
Then how come
carrotsk is a dollar?

141
00:08:50,471 --> 00:08:51,460
Dollar fifty.

142
00:08:51,505 --> 00:08:53,200
You buy what l don't feel
like selling,

143
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,230
it'll cost you $2.

144
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,335
All right, here you go.

145
00:08:57,378 --> 00:08:58,902
Uh-uh-uh-uh!

146
00:08:58,946 --> 00:09:01,574
Hey, deadbeat, this is a nickel.

147
00:09:01,616 --> 00:09:04,244
l pays what l feels like paying.

148
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,483
You're not up to no good,
are you?

149
00:09:07,521 --> 00:09:10,354
'Cause if you are, there's
a 50-cent up-to-no-good tax.

150
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,357
Come here! Come back!

151
00:09:15,396 --> 00:09:17,523
Seems like everywhere

152
00:09:17,565 --> 00:09:19,533
Lots of people here

153
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:21,467
Try to blow me down...

154
00:09:22,737 --> 00:09:25,399
Unlike the clothes l wear

155
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:26,599
l haven't...

156
00:09:26,641 --> 00:09:28,131
Careful, there.

157
00:09:28,175 --> 00:09:30,143
What blew him into town?

158
00:09:30,177 --> 00:09:32,145
Oh, the short arm of the law,
huh?

159
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:36,639
Blow me down

160
00:09:36,684 --> 00:09:37,946
Blow me down...

161
00:09:37,985 --> 00:09:39,714
Ow!

162
00:09:39,754 --> 00:09:43,485
Hey, come ba... hey, hey-- ah!

163
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,428
Uh, are you the piano tuner

164
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,767
or the man
with the party favor?

165
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,500
You got a room for renk?

166
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,768
What for what?

167
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:04,174
Renk, renk-- your sign says you
got a room for renk.

168
00:10:04,211 --> 00:10:06,577
Oh, my stars and gardens!

169
00:10:06,614 --> 00:10:08,582
My mind was
a million miles away.

170
00:10:08,616 --> 00:10:11,278
Come in before you catch
your death of mud.

171
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,752
''Mud.''

172
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:17,057
''Oyls.'' That explains it.

173
00:10:17,091 --> 00:10:18,581
She's down a quart.

174
00:10:18,626 --> 00:10:21,595
Scums-- l'll find you.

175
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:24,427
Come on, come on!

176
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:29,265
Mmm. Don't make them
like they used to.

177
00:10:30,734 --> 00:10:32,429
Oh, come on.

178
00:10:37,174 --> 00:10:39,165
Oh!

179
00:10:41,211 --> 00:10:43,202
l'm sorry, Mother,
but it's ugly.

180
00:10:43,247 --> 00:10:46,182
l ask you, have you ever
seen anything so ugly?

181
00:10:46,216 --> 00:10:48,150
l won't be engaged
in this hat.

182
00:10:48,185 --> 00:10:49,482
l heard that.

183
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,112
Don't think
l didn't hear that.

184
00:10:51,155 --> 00:10:52,486
Oh...

185
00:10:52,523 --> 00:10:54,013
She owes me an apology.

186
00:10:54,058 --> 00:10:55,286
Oh... ugly.

187
00:10:55,326 --> 00:10:57,419
There's nothing left to say.

188
00:10:57,461 --> 00:10:58,792
What do you think?

189
00:10:58,896 --> 00:11:01,091
l think it's up to you, dear.

190
00:11:01,131 --> 00:11:03,895
Well, what do you think? Ugly.

191
00:11:03,934 --> 00:11:06,459
l think it's a conspiracy.

192
00:11:06,503 --> 00:11:07,800
Oh...

193
00:11:07,871 --> 00:11:10,635
Why would they manufacture
deliberate ugliness

194
00:11:10,674 --> 00:11:12,767
unless they wanted me
to look ugly?

195
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,574
lf we find that out,
we find out everything.

196
00:11:15,612 --> 00:11:18,080
There's a stranger
in t... um... ooh...

197
00:11:18,115 --> 00:11:19,207
Oh...

198
00:11:19,249 --> 00:11:20,409
l can't get engaged.

199
00:11:20,451 --> 00:11:22,510
You'll have to tell
Bluto; l can't.

200
00:11:22,553 --> 00:11:24,316
We'll have to cancel the party

201
00:11:24,355 --> 00:11:25,447
tomorrow night.

202
00:11:25,489 --> 00:11:26,979
lt's not my fault
that it's so ugly.

203
00:11:28,058 --> 00:11:29,150
What are you doing

204
00:11:29,193 --> 00:11:30,751
listening in on
a private conversation

205
00:11:30,794 --> 00:11:31,920
between me and my mother?

206
00:11:31,962 --> 00:11:34,863
l have a good mind to have
my father call a policeman.

207
00:11:34,898 --> 00:11:37,332
Olive, will you show
Mister... Mister...?

208
00:11:37,368 --> 00:11:38,460
Oh. Popeye, ma'am.

209
00:11:38,502 --> 00:11:39,730
... Mr. Eye

210
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:40,896
the spare room?

211
00:11:40,938 --> 00:11:42,030
Just Popeye, ma'am.

212
00:11:42,072 --> 00:11:43,039
Go upstairs, Mr. Eye.

213
00:11:43,073 --> 00:11:44,233
Olive will show you the room.

214
00:11:44,274 --> 00:11:45,206
Thanks.

215
00:11:46,276 --> 00:11:47,709
Some kind of asylum here.

216
00:11:47,745 --> 00:11:48,769
Show me a room.

217
00:11:48,812 --> 00:11:50,006
Show me some courtesy

218
00:11:50,047 --> 00:11:51,014
might be nice.

219
00:11:51,048 --> 00:11:52,515
l don't see why
l have to do anything

220
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:54,016
on the day
before my engagement party

221
00:11:54,051 --> 00:11:55,518
when nothing's ready,
especially me.

222
00:11:55,552 --> 00:11:57,782
And what kind of name is that,
anyway-- Popeye?

223
00:11:57,855 --> 00:11:59,015
Pretty strange.

224
00:11:59,056 --> 00:12:00,921
What kind of name is Olive Oyl?

225
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,119
Sounds like
some kind of lubricants.

226
00:12:04,194 --> 00:12:05,525
Thank you very much, ma'am.

227
00:12:06,597 --> 00:12:08,622
Don't look in that room;
that's my room.

228
00:12:08,665 --> 00:12:10,132
Meant no disrespect there.

229
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:11,498
Ugly, huh?

230
00:12:11,535 --> 00:12:13,332
You owe me an apology.

231
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,496
What?

232
00:12:14,538 --> 00:12:16,301
Wonder who shoved
a feather in his ear?

233
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,307
What'd you say?

234
00:12:17,341 --> 00:12:19,366
Sure is nice weather
you have here.

235
00:12:22,513 --> 00:12:23,810
Your name really Olives?

236
00:12:23,847 --> 00:12:25,144
So what?

237
00:12:25,182 --> 00:12:26,149
Olives Oyl?

238
00:12:27,284 --> 00:12:29,013
You don't look Greek to me.

239
00:12:29,052 --> 00:12:30,212
So, you're short.

240
00:12:30,254 --> 00:12:32,347
Or are you just passing
yourself off as short?

241
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:34,482
Can l see me room now?

242
00:12:34,525 --> 00:12:36,390
Ooh, as if l cared.

243
00:12:36,427 --> 00:12:38,224
Let me give you a hand there.

244
00:12:38,262 --> 00:12:39,229
Maybe it needs a little oil.

245
00:12:39,263 --> 00:12:40,252
Oh!

246
00:12:41,598 --> 00:12:42,860
Oh, oh...

247
00:12:47,237 --> 00:12:50,035
Nice-looking room.

248
00:12:54,111 --> 00:12:57,569
Never seen a room done
in early demolish-kin before,

249
00:12:57,614 --> 00:12:59,104
but this'll do for me.

250
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:01,379
Careful how you treat
that bed.

251
00:13:01,418 --> 00:13:03,181
Nothing goes on this bed.

252
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,482
Sorry, ma'am, it's just some...

253
00:13:04,521 --> 00:13:06,489
Watch that lamp!

254
00:13:06,523 --> 00:13:08,491
Let me give you some assistance.

255
00:13:08,525 --> 00:13:09,890
Here, give me your hand.

256
00:13:09,927 --> 00:13:11,895
There, that's it.
Yeah, here we go.

257
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:13,089
Oh, you're in first.

258
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,792
ls that... oh...
Boy, is it hot in here.

259
00:13:15,866 --> 00:13:17,265
l still respect you.

260
00:13:17,301 --> 00:13:18,290
Ooh!

261
00:13:22,739 --> 00:13:24,798
Me bad eye, didn't see that.

262
00:13:24,842 --> 00:13:25,831
Hmph!

263
00:13:30,547 --> 00:13:31,980
Thanks for your help.

264
00:13:32,015 --> 00:13:34,984
Uh, Miss Oyl, maybe...

265
00:13:44,394 --> 00:13:46,453
Don't forget to put
the cat out, dear.

266
00:13:46,497 --> 00:13:48,192
We don't have a cat.

267
00:13:48,232 --> 00:13:49,529
Eau de toilette.

268
00:13:49,566 --> 00:13:51,329
Yeah, eau de toilette.

269
00:13:52,402 --> 00:13:53,699
Yeah.

270
00:13:54,771 --> 00:13:55,863
How do you like that?

271
00:13:55,906 --> 00:13:57,703
Gold is up 20 cents,
two dollars an ounce.

272
00:13:57,741 --> 00:13:59,003
Out of my kitchen, Mr. Wimpy.

273
00:13:59,042 --> 00:14:00,270
l knew it, l knew it, see...

274
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,607
You wait for the supper gong.

275
00:14:01,645 --> 00:14:03,237
l could've made
a fortune on Billings

276
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,646
if Bluto would've let me go
directly to the Commodore.

277
00:14:05,682 --> 00:14:07,673
He's so jealous of me,
that Bluto.

278
00:14:07,718 --> 00:14:09,413
Well, who wouldn't be?

279
00:14:09,453 --> 00:14:11,182
Me, l'm not jealous of Castor.

280
00:14:11,221 --> 00:14:12,245
He's my son.

281
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:14,052
Man jealous of his own son.

282
00:14:14,091 --> 00:14:15,581
You owe me an apology.

283
00:14:15,626 --> 00:14:16,786
l didn't mean you.

284
00:14:16,827 --> 00:14:19,523
Never lets me go
to the Commodore.

285
00:14:19,563 --> 00:14:22,031
Commodore is a paragon
of sagacity.

286
00:14:22,065 --> 00:14:24,431
lf ever l could
put in a good word...

287
00:14:24,468 --> 00:14:25,435
''Shut up'' is the word.

288
00:14:25,469 --> 00:14:26,959
''Pass'' is another word
that Wimpy...

289
00:14:27,004 --> 00:14:28,062
You don't pass.

290
00:14:28,105 --> 00:14:30,801
He should be killed to death.

291
00:14:30,908 --> 00:14:33,706
lt says here the Commodore's
taxing salt again.

292
00:14:33,744 --> 00:14:36,235
Don't look as good as l smell,
but too late now.

293
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,611
Got to go.

294
00:14:37,648 --> 00:14:42,278
Oh, Mr. Eye,
have you met-- uh, Pop?

295
00:14:42,319 --> 00:14:43,752
Mr. Wimpy, my son Castor,

296
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,754
Mr. Geezil, my husband Cole.

297
00:14:45,822 --> 00:14:47,915
We're all one big
happy family here.

298
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,926
-Hmph!
-Although not really.

299
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,928
l mean, well, Mr. Geezil
and Mr. Wimpy are, um...

300
00:14:51,962 --> 00:14:53,259
Me, l'm family.

301
00:14:53,297 --> 00:14:55,356
Well, you're my husband.

302
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:57,299
You owe me an apology.

303
00:14:57,334 --> 00:14:59,768
Well, l can't find anything.

304
00:14:59,803 --> 00:15:01,327
What are you
looking for, Olive?

305
00:15:01,371 --> 00:15:02,895
-A glass.
-Oh, uh, here's a glass.

306
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,567
That's a short, fat, ugly glass.

307
00:15:04,608 --> 00:15:06,098
l want a tall, pretty,
slender glass.

308
00:15:06,143 --> 00:15:07,110
They're all broken.

309
00:15:07,144 --> 00:15:08,270
l could've made a fortune

310
00:15:08,312 --> 00:15:09,438
-in fish futures...
-Fish?

311
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:11,310
but l'd have to dip
into capital.

312
00:15:11,348 --> 00:15:13,316
Fish futures smell.

313
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,750
What kind of glass
do you want, Olive?

314
00:15:15,786 --> 00:15:16,775
A wine glass

315
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,618
or a brandy glass,
or a water glass?

316
00:15:19,656 --> 00:15:21,419
Oh, not a thing--
l don't want a thing.

317
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:22,425
Real appetizing.

318
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:23,426
l want a fork.

319
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,552
Right beside your plate.

320
00:15:24,595 --> 00:15:26,290
lf it was a knife,
it would cut you.

321
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:27,558
-And a knife.
-Will you sit down?

322
00:15:27,598 --> 00:15:29,293
Why don't l have a knife?
And a nice dress?

323
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,857
You owe me an apology.

324
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,560
Passing fish, please.

325
00:15:34,605 --> 00:15:36,095
Fish, excellent idea, Miss Oyl.

326
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:38,004
l would suggest before
matrimony, fish.

327
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,100
Fish before matrimony.

328
00:15:40,143 --> 00:15:42,134
Ooh, that does look good, there.

329
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:44,340
Wish l had a plate though.

330
00:15:44,381 --> 00:15:48,112
...because four times
engaged is three times much.

331
00:15:48,151 --> 00:15:50,483
Oh, he can't talk me out
of anything; l'm not a child.

332
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,748
l'll say you're not a child.

333
00:15:51,788 --> 00:15:54,518
-Who says l'm not a child?
-You said you're not a child

334
00:15:54,558 --> 00:15:55,582
and l agreed with you,
that's who.

335
00:15:55,626 --> 00:15:56,650
Who asked you
to agree with me?

336
00:15:56,693 --> 00:15:58,183
Well, no one can stop me
from agreeing with you

337
00:15:58,228 --> 00:15:59,752
-if l want to.
-l can.

338
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:00,990
Quarreling at my table.

339
00:16:01,031 --> 00:16:02,464
You both owe me an apology.

340
00:16:02,499 --> 00:16:03,966
Sorry, Pop.

341
00:16:04,001 --> 00:16:04,490
What?

342
00:16:04,534 --> 00:16:05,626
Please pass the shrimp,

343
00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:06,761
chicken and meatballs.

344
00:16:06,803 --> 00:16:09,169
Well, l don't know.

345
00:16:09,206 --> 00:16:12,175
Captain Bluto has
the patience of Job.

346
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:13,198
Or is it job?

347
00:16:13,243 --> 00:16:15,973
Certainly got
a very good job, Job.

348
00:16:16,013 --> 00:16:18,504
And he needs
a lot of patience.

349
00:16:18,548 --> 00:16:20,641
Why, he runs this town
for the Commodore

350
00:16:20,684 --> 00:16:21,651
while he's away.

351
00:16:21,685 --> 00:16:23,118
And the Commodore's
always away.

352
00:16:23,153 --> 00:16:24,950
As a matter of fact,
l've never seen him.

353
00:16:24,988 --> 00:16:26,148
-Have you, Cole?
-What?

354
00:16:26,189 --> 00:16:28,453
l'd never let a girl
break my engagement.

355
00:16:28,492 --> 00:16:31,290
l'd break her nose before
she broke my engagement.

356
00:16:31,328 --> 00:16:34,354
And you better not try on me
what you pulled on Bluto,

357
00:16:34,398 --> 00:16:36,525
because l'm no pushover.

358
00:16:36,566 --> 00:16:38,397
You owe your sister
an apology.

359
00:16:38,435 --> 00:16:39,925
Will you stop fidgeting?

360
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,232
Finishing touch here.

361
00:16:41,271 --> 00:16:43,136
Oh, this knife won't cut.

362
00:16:43,173 --> 00:16:44,162
Here, take mine.

363
00:16:44,207 --> 00:16:45,174
Not since l was child

364
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,937
have we had a sharp knife
in this house.

365
00:16:46,977 --> 00:16:48,467
You owe me an apology.

366
00:16:48,512 --> 00:16:49,945
You don't like our knives.

367
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,380
Bluto's rich, he can buy you
plenty of knives.

368
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,884
Ooh, l hate this table,
it's ugly.

369
00:16:54,918 --> 00:16:56,317
l'm the only one
with nerve enough

370
00:16:56,353 --> 00:16:57,479
to tell the truth about it.

371
00:16:57,521 --> 00:16:59,546
Well, then, why don't you
let Bluto the pushover

372
00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:00,556
buy you a new table?

373
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,557
-Am l right, Pop?
-Right.

374
00:17:01,591 --> 00:17:02,558
l'm right, right?

375
00:17:02,592 --> 00:17:03,559
-You're right.
-Right.

376
00:17:03,593 --> 00:17:04,753
Nothing left?

377
00:17:04,861 --> 00:17:06,590
Oh... Bluto, Bluto, Bluto.

378
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:09,394
Everyone takes advantage
of my poor Bluto.

379
00:17:09,433 --> 00:17:11,560
Get a new... glass,
a new knife.

380
00:17:11,601 --> 00:17:13,501
Now they want a table.
Well, hmph!

381
00:17:13,537 --> 00:17:15,004
That's why l always
have to break off

382
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:16,335
our engagement--
to stop you all

383
00:17:16,373 --> 00:17:17,863
from taking advantage
of the sweetest,

384
00:17:17,908 --> 00:17:19,637
most humble man
on the face of this Earth!

385
00:17:19,676 --> 00:17:20,643
Hmph.

386
00:17:20,677 --> 00:17:21,735
Mmm.

387
00:17:25,248 --> 00:17:26,272
You make me sick.

388
00:17:29,786 --> 00:17:32,721
Never good to be too full,
l guess.

389
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,614
lt's 9:00!

390
00:18:25,656 --> 00:18:27,556
Curfew!

391
00:18:27,591 --> 00:18:30,617
Lights... out!

392
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,637
You can have a kiss now.

393
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:50,145
Oh!

394
00:18:54,785 --> 00:18:56,309
Poppa.

395
00:18:56,353 --> 00:18:58,082
Pretty soon you and me

396
00:18:58,122 --> 00:19:00,750
are going to be together again,
huh?

397
00:19:00,858 --> 00:19:02,291
Yeah.

398
00:19:02,326 --> 00:19:05,591
30 years ain't that long.

399
00:19:05,629 --> 00:19:09,622
Besides, next Wednesday's
our annual-versity.

400
00:19:09,667 --> 00:19:11,328
Yeah? Yeah.

401
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,730

That's all l'm axskin you.

403
00:19:21,645 --> 00:19:23,738

00:19:58,482 --> 00:20:00,040
Sweep, sweep...

408

Ah... whoop!

00:20:06,824 --> 00:20:08,621
Eee-oh!

411
00:20:09,727 --> 00:20:13,663
Everything

412
00:20:14,832 --> 00:20:18,165
Everything is food to go

413
00:20:18,202 --> 00:20:23,265
Everything is food
for thought

414
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:26,470
Everything you knead

415
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,809
lt is food

416

00:20:36,687 --> 00:20:40,919
Everything is meat, meat, meat

Careful what you put
on your feet

00:20:45,529 --> 00:20:49,329
Once it lived on an ani-mule

426
00:21:22,766 --> 00:21:26,964
Everything is food to go now

427
00:21:27,004 --> 00:21:30,735
Everything is
fast-food chains

428
00:21:30,774 --> 00:21:34,540
From your lemon
to your sugarcane

430
00:21:38,349 --> 00:21:41,512
Everything is food

00:21:44,421 --> 00:21:45,388
Did you order a hamburger?

432
00:21:45,422 --> 00:21:46,787
Yeah, l ordered a hamburger.

433
00:21:46,824 --> 00:21:48,291
That's what l got,
a hamburger.

434
00:21:48,325 --> 00:21:49,292
No, l beg to disagree.

435
00:21:49,326 --> 00:21:50,520
Rough House,

436
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:51,528

438
00:21:52,796 --> 00:21:54,093
Who's paying?

439
00:21:54,131 --> 00:21:55,393
l'm buying, he's paying.

440
00:21:55,432 --> 00:21:56,922
A nickel hamburger tax?

441
00:21:56,967 --> 00:21:58,559
l'd refuse to pay
if l were you.

442
00:21:58,602 --> 00:21:59,933
A shocking abuse of power.

443
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:02,268
Rough House!

444
00:22:03,874 --> 00:22:07,332
Food, food, food

446
00:22:10,814 --> 00:22:13,408

00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:40,941
Everything is upside-down

451
00:22:43,013 --> 00:22:46,949
Everything is sunny-side up

452
00:22:46,984 --> 00:22:49,077
Did you pay for this

453
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:51,087
ln American?

454
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:54,147
They can't trick us
with no hot dog

455
00:22:54,191 --> 00:22:58,127
Everything is food,
food, food

456
00:22:58,162 --> 00:23:01,563
Everything is food.

457
00:23:10,741 --> 00:23:13,039
Hey, hey, hey, Laverne!

Give us a smooch!

459
00:23:17,481 --> 00:23:20,473
l really need someone
to kind of talk to,

460
00:23:20,517 --> 00:23:22,815
'cause l thought everybody
in this town might be deef.

461
00:23:22,886 --> 00:23:23,818
Huh, what's that?

462
00:23:23,887 --> 00:23:24,819
Huh? Oh.

463
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:29,426
You know, jusk why
l'm here is...

464
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,690
l'm looking for me pap.

465
00:23:31,728 --> 00:23:32,695
Yeah, oh...

466
00:23:32,729 --> 00:23:34,458
l've searched
the seven seas for him,

467
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:36,227
and l haven't found him yet.

468
00:23:36,266 --> 00:23:39,497
l was only two years old,
me own pap left me.

469
00:23:39,536 --> 00:23:41,231
l was just a mere infink.

470
00:23:41,271 --> 00:23:42,636
Me own pap...

471
00:23:42,673 --> 00:23:45,073
Pipe down, will ya?

472
00:23:45,108 --> 00:23:47,372
Me own pap ditches me.

473
00:23:47,411 --> 00:23:48,537
l'm a very tolerant man,

474
00:23:48,579 --> 00:23:50,547
except when it comes
to holding a grudge.

475
00:23:50,581 --> 00:23:52,708
l never thought
l'd forgive me paps,

476
00:23:52,749 --> 00:23:54,239
but about seven years ago,

477
00:23:54,284 --> 00:23:56,878
l ships out on this boat,
The Gloomy Gus.

478
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,651
That's a boat. Yeah.

479
00:24:00,691 --> 00:24:02,386
Just off the coast of Guam.

480
00:24:02,426 --> 00:24:04,018
lt breaks up on this typhoon,

481
00:24:04,061 --> 00:24:06,188
and l'm stuck on
this raft for 45 days

482
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,492
without food or waters.

483
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:10,193
But after all
this time on this raft,

484
00:24:10,234 --> 00:24:12,293
this visiktation comes to me.

485
00:24:12,336 --> 00:24:17,137
Looks just like me mother,
rest her soul.

486
00:24:17,174 --> 00:24:21,304
And it says,
''Your pap is still alive.''

487
00:24:21,345 --> 00:24:22,277
Excuse me.

488
00:24:23,947 --> 00:24:26,814
So, when l was finally rescued,

489
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:29,375
l figured out that l got
to forgive me paps, you know?

490
00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:30,443
Uh, you see,

491
00:24:30,487 --> 00:24:33,012
l'm only afeared
that he might be dead,

492
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:35,286
and never realize what a
fine figure of an orphink

493
00:24:35,325 --> 00:24:36,656
l turned out to be.

494
00:24:36,693 --> 00:24:38,923
You sure got a nice-looking
face there,

495
00:24:38,962 --> 00:24:40,862
One-Eye.

496
00:24:42,533 --> 00:24:44,057
One-Eye?

He's tall

Not a mandolin

623
00:32:33,133 --> 00:32:35,465
Oh, no

624
00:32:35,502 --> 00:32:37,493
He's an accordion

625
00:32:39,472 --> 00:32:44,136

each night to keep him warm

Oh, boy

00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,221
He's virile

629
00:32:57,257 --> 00:32:58,952
And he's strong

630
00:32:58,992 --> 00:33:00,687

Sounds like Fluto.

636
00:33:07,534 --> 00:33:08,694
Bluto.

637
00:33:08,735 --> 00:33:09,963
Bluto.

638
00:33:10,003 --> 00:33:10,970
At your services, sir.

639
00:33:11,004 --> 00:33:12,767
There's a good picture
in the paper this week.

640
00:33:12,806 --> 00:33:13,773
A lovely present for you

641
00:33:13,807 --> 00:33:15,206
down at the pawn shop,
Captain Bluto.

642
00:33:15,241 --> 00:33:16,970
l would have brought it,
but it was too late.

643
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:18,170
Anytime you want me to come by

644
00:33:18,211 --> 00:33:20,145
and stain up the boat,
Captain Bluto.

645
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,841

He's got money and respect

647
00:33:26,152 --> 00:33:27,483
That's true

648
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:32,355
He's better than the rest

649
00:33:32,392 --> 00:33:34,087
That's true

650
00:33:34,127 --> 00:33:38,587
He may not be the best

651
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:42,026
But he's large

652
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:44,395
And he's mine...

653
00:33:44,437 --> 00:33:45,631
She can have him.

654
00:33:45,672 --> 00:33:46,798
Yeah.

655
00:33:46,873 --> 00:33:48,431
She loves me.

656
00:33:51,511 --> 00:33:53,479
Of course she does.

657
00:33:53,513 --> 00:33:55,310
She don't love me.

658
00:33:55,348 --> 00:33:56,474
Oh, no.

659
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,614
She'll marry me.

660
00:34:03,957 --> 00:34:06,653

00:34:16,269 --> 00:34:18,203
She won't marry me.

669
00:34:19,272 --> 00:34:20,204
Oh.

670
00:34:24,911 --> 00:34:26,037
She will.

671
00:34:30,316 --> 00:34:32,181
She won't.

672
00:34:39,792 --> 00:34:45,059
lt may seem funny,
but it's not

673
00:34:45,098 --> 00:34:46,793
Oh, no

674
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:49,358
l'm thankful

675
00:34:49,402 --> 00:34:51,427
For what l've got

676
00:34:51,471 --> 00:34:52,699
Me, too

677
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:57,676
lt may not be a lot

678
00:34:59,078 --> 00:35:02,445
But he's large.

679
00:35:05,652 --> 00:35:06,619
She will.

680
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,378
Yes, yes.

681
00:35:12,458 --> 00:35:14,392
She...

682
00:35:18,398 --> 00:35:22,198
Faulty flower...
C-Captain Bluto.

683
00:35:27,307 --> 00:35:29,639
Mrs. Oyl, Olive's...

684
00:35:29,676 --> 00:35:31,644
Olive's what?

685
00:35:31,678 --> 00:35:33,168
Olive's...

686
00:35:34,514 --> 00:35:37,005
...getting ready.

687
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:39,018
Good.

688
00:35:39,052 --> 00:35:40,178
Now, where were we?

689
00:35:40,219 --> 00:35:43,518
Uh, she won't
marry you, she...

690
00:35:47,126 --> 00:35:49,060
She will!

691
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,961
Oh, my word!

692
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,432
Son-in-law.

693
00:35:58,972 --> 00:36:00,735
Oh, yeah, yeah.

694
00:36:00,773 --> 00:36:01,933
Ah! Ooh.

695
00:36:25,426 --> 00:36:28,953
Olive!

696
00:36:43,844 --> 00:36:46,005
Marvelous, marvelous.

697
00:36:46,046 --> 00:36:47,638
No place to go.

698
00:36:47,681 --> 00:36:49,672
Can't go to no party
without an invite.

699
00:36:49,717 --> 00:36:50,706
Whoo!

700
00:36:51,819 --> 00:36:53,980
-Ho, ho, ho, whoa.
-Whoo! Ooh.

701
00:36:54,021 --> 00:36:55,318
-Miss Oyl.
-Oh...

702
00:36:55,356 --> 00:36:56,550
You scared the wits out of me.

703
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,387
Yeah, l almost knocked 'em
out of you, too.

704
00:36:58,425 --> 00:37:00,017
-Sorry l did that to you.
-What right do you have

705
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,823
to lurk here in the dark
in the middle of the night

706
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:03,157
and scare the wits
out of a person?

707
00:37:03,197 --> 00:37:04,994
l wasn't.
l was just, uh, kind of, uh...

708
00:37:05,032 --> 00:37:05,999
Oh, oh.

709
00:37:06,033 --> 00:37:07,830
How's your party going,
Miss Oyl?

710
00:37:07,868 --> 00:37:09,699
-Oh, that's a dumb question.
-Yeah.

711
00:37:09,737 --> 00:37:12,001
Where do you think l'm headed
right this minute?

712
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:13,404
Um... well, uh,

713
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,668
mmm, that way, l think.

714
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:15,675
Out of town.

715
00:37:15,709 --> 00:37:17,267
-l am not headed out of town.
-Oh.

716
00:37:17,311 --> 00:37:19,472
Don't you see which
direction l'm facing?

717
00:37:19,513 --> 00:37:21,242
-You're going, now you're...
-Oh, ooh, whoa.

718
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:22,306
-Now you're facing east.
-Oh.

719
00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:23,475
Maybe a little southwest.

720
00:37:23,517 --> 00:37:24,677
-Place your bets.
-Oh. Oh!

721
00:37:24,718 --> 00:37:26,845
You need some help with
your bags there, Miss Oyl?

722
00:37:26,887 --> 00:37:28,252
-Ooh, oh, no.
-l didn't touch ya.

723
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:29,347
l didn't mean to hurt ya.

724
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:30,550
Thank you.

725
00:37:30,591 --> 00:37:32,024
-Oh, you do.
-Oh.

726
00:37:35,663 --> 00:37:36,789
Oh.

727
00:37:36,831 --> 00:37:39,800
No, that's the wrong way.

728
00:37:39,834 --> 00:37:40,823
Oh.

729
00:37:42,002 --> 00:37:43,799
No, that's the wrong way.

730
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:45,305
l want to go...

731
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,069
Oh...

732
00:37:48,108 --> 00:37:49,541
Oh, oh...

733
00:37:49,577 --> 00:37:51,477
Whoo! Oh. Oh, oh.

734
00:37:51,512 --> 00:37:52,672
Oh!

735
00:37:52,713 --> 00:37:53,805
Oh, oh...

736
00:37:53,848 --> 00:37:54,815
Oh...

737
00:37:54,915 --> 00:37:55,973
That way.

738
00:37:56,016 --> 00:37:56,983
That'll be 50 cents

739
00:37:57,017 --> 00:37:58,314
impersonating-a-traffic-cop tax.

740
00:37:58,352 --> 00:37:59,319
What?

741
00:37:59,353 --> 00:38:00,615
Oh.

742
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:01,814
l'm sorry, Miss Oyl.

743
00:38:01,922 --> 00:38:04,117
Didn't recognize you
from the back.

744
00:38:04,158 --> 00:38:05,989
lt won't happen again.

745
00:38:06,026 --> 00:38:08,221
How come Miss Oyl
don't have to pay no taxes?

746
00:38:08,262 --> 00:38:10,594
That's ten cents question tax.

747
00:38:10,631 --> 00:38:13,725
But... l'll let you off
this time

748
00:38:13,767 --> 00:38:15,632
since you're with Miss Oyl.

749
00:38:15,669 --> 00:38:17,159
Good night, Miss Oyl.

750
00:38:17,204 --> 00:38:18,694
Well, how come being
with Miss Oyl

751
00:38:18,739 --> 00:38:21,003
means l don't have
to pay no...

752
00:38:21,041 --> 00:38:22,372
...taxes?

753
00:38:22,409 --> 00:38:26,038
Well, l don't know
what you're talking about.

754
00:38:29,483 --> 00:38:33,112
Here's a nice cup of tea
for you, Captain Bluto,

755
00:38:33,153 --> 00:38:34,484
while you're waiting.

756
00:38:39,827 --> 00:38:42,990
Where's Olive?

757
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,395
Olive?

758
00:38:44,431 --> 00:38:45,659
You think everyone pays taxes

759
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:47,394
but me and my family,
don't you? Mm-hmm.

760
00:38:47,434 --> 00:38:48,799
Well, you couldn't be
more wrong.

761
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:50,359
lf l'm wrong, why
am l in the right?

762
00:38:50,404 --> 00:38:52,235
You think it's because
l'm engaged to Bluto

763
00:38:52,273 --> 00:38:54,002
and Bluto runs the town
for the Commodore

764
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:55,133
so we get special favors.

765
00:38:55,175 --> 00:38:56,233
Well, it's a lie. Hmm.

766
00:38:56,277 --> 00:38:57,835
Olive!

767
00:39:04,018 --> 00:39:05,383
Bluto is kind and generous

768
00:39:05,419 --> 00:39:07,614
and likes to do things
for his loved ones.

769
00:39:08,856 --> 00:39:10,483
And you want me to
hurt his feelings.

770
00:39:10,524 --> 00:39:11,786
Well, phooey on you.

771
00:39:13,193 --> 00:39:15,957
Hmm. You don't even care
enough about me or my family

772
00:39:15,996 --> 00:39:17,520
to be at my engagement party.

773
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:20,397
And what are you doing here
in Sweethaven anyway, hmm?

774
00:39:20,434 --> 00:39:22,334
Well, l'm-l'm looking
for me pap.

775
00:39:22,369 --> 00:39:23,461
-Mmm.
-Yeah.

776
00:39:23,504 --> 00:39:26,598
Oh, well, if that's true,
then where is he?

777
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,801
Well, yeah, um, got me there.

778
00:39:28,842 --> 00:39:30,332
l don't really know.

779
00:39:30,377 --> 00:39:32,004
l... l got this sense

780
00:39:32,046 --> 00:39:33,775
that he's here though,
you know?

781
00:39:33,814 --> 00:39:35,839
Oh, well, all right,
l'll wait. Hmm.

782
00:39:35,883 --> 00:39:38,351
Anyway, there are too
many guests as it is.

783
00:39:38,385 --> 00:39:39,511
Half of them l hate.

784
00:39:57,738 --> 00:39:59,365
One thing l remember
about me pap

785
00:39:59,406 --> 00:40:01,874
was that he always used
to throw me up in the air.

786
00:40:01,976 --> 00:40:04,604
But he'd never be there
when l come down, you know.

787
00:40:04,645 --> 00:40:05,873
-Heh, heh, heh.
-Mmm.

788
00:40:05,913 --> 00:40:07,813
Boy, he had a sense ka humor,
didn't he?

789
00:40:07,848 --> 00:40:09,042
Yeah, that was me pap.

790
00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:10,846
l remember that time
he gave me

791
00:40:10,884 --> 00:40:12,374
an electric eel as a toy.

792
00:40:12,419 --> 00:40:13,545
Eep!

793
00:40:13,587 --> 00:40:14,884
Yeah, that was fun.

794
00:40:14,922 --> 00:40:16,048
Or he'd rock me in my cradle

795
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:18,058
real, real, real hard
and l'd lose me formula.

796
00:40:18,092 --> 00:40:21,550
And then he'd say, ''One
day, you'll be a sailor.''

797
00:40:21,595 --> 00:40:24,291
That... that's what
l am today.

798
00:40:24,331 --> 00:40:27,198
Yeah. Sometimes,
he'd bounce me on his knee.

799
00:40:27,234 --> 00:40:29,065
Most of the time
he'd miss, though

800
00:40:29,103 --> 00:40:31,537
'cause he couldn't see
too well with one eye.

801
00:40:33,007 --> 00:40:34,338
Oh, me pap, yeah.

802
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:36,673
Well, l'm not waiting
any longer. Hmm.

803
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,473
Oh, sorry, Miss Oyl.

804
00:40:39,713 --> 00:40:40,839
l was philoscofying.

805
00:40:40,881 --> 00:40:42,178
Mm-hmm.

806
00:40:42,216 --> 00:40:45,185
...between us, got kind of
derailed and...

807
00:40:45,219 --> 00:40:47,153
Oh, yeah, long time waiting.

808
00:40:47,187 --> 00:40:48,848
Wait a while..

809
00:40:48,889 --> 00:40:51,483
What are you doing
with that basket?

810
00:40:51,525 --> 00:40:53,220
Well, l-l'm carrying it.

811
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,194
lt's your basket, ain't it?

812
00:40:55,229 --> 00:40:56,355
lt is not my basket.

813
00:40:56,397 --> 00:40:58,865
Somebody has deliberately
painted that basket

814
00:40:58,966 --> 00:41:00,297
to look like my basket.

815
00:41:00,334 --> 00:41:02,165
My basket was clean
and beautiful

816
00:41:02,202 --> 00:41:03,601
and this basket is ugly.

817
00:41:03,637 --> 00:41:05,332
-Rattlesnake!
-Miss Oyl, we should at least

818
00:41:05,372 --> 00:41:06,703
have dinner first,
or something.

819
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,764
Rattlesnake!
Rattlesnake!

820
00:41:07,808 --> 00:41:09,207
Oh, rattlesnake!
Ooh! Oh, oh, oh!

821
00:41:09,243 --> 00:41:10,972
Rattlesnakes?
Where is it, Miss Oyl?

822
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:11,568
Where is it?

823
00:41:11,612 --> 00:41:12,738
Oh, oh, rattlesnake, oh!

824
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,872
Don't worry, Miss Oyl,

825
00:41:13,914 --> 00:41:15,040
l've handled vermins before.

826
00:41:15,082 --> 00:41:17,016
l'll rattle that snakes
so it's a pair of shoes.

827
00:41:17,051 --> 00:41:18,040
Rattlesnake!
Rattlesnake!

828
00:41:18,085 --> 00:41:19,450
l'll rattle that...

829
00:41:19,486 --> 00:41:21,818
-l'll rattle him upside-down.

-You're bats.
-Oh, yeah?

l found him in Sweethaven.
That is why he's me Swee'pea.

1031

-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm, yeah.

1034
00:49:12,752 --> 00:49:14,310
Well, Swee'pea is
about the worst name

l ever heard on a baby.

1036
00:49:15,455 --> 00:49:17,514
Well, what do you want me
to call him? Baby Oyl?

1037
00:49:20,193 --> 00:49:22,753
Excuse me.

What could happen to me?

1041
00:49:54,694 --> 00:49:56,787
Well, l could get killed.

1042
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:59,321
lt'd be worth getting killed
to help Mom and Pop.

1043
00:49:59,365 --> 00:50:01,265
What if l won?

1044
00:50:01,301 --> 00:50:02,563
l'm fast, l'm foxy.

1045
00:50:02,602 --> 00:50:05,093
He could have a heart attack.

1046
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:23,683
Sweet Sweethaven

1047

taking me to a fight

1050
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:33,896
and my parents to a fight

1051
00:50:33,933 --> 00:50:35,195
and my baby to a fight.

1052
00:50:36,803 --> 00:50:40,432
Ah, Sweethaven...

1053

Oh, fights are not fun.

1055
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:52,415
Know the words
for this song, Cole?

1056
00:50:52,452 --> 00:50:53,919
Of course l know the words.

1057
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,681
lt's our national anthem,
isn't it?

1058
00:50:55,722 --> 00:50:56,882
Pardon us...

1059
00:50:56,923 --> 00:50:58,720
Ah-ah-ah.
That'll be 62 cents--

1060
00:50:58,758 --> 00:51:01,056
going-to-an-illegal-
sporting-event tax.

1061
00:51:01,094 --> 00:51:03,528
lf it's illegal,
how come it's going on?

1062
00:51:05,732 --> 00:51:08,394
Ladies and gentlemen!

1063

Be careful...

1066

Ooh, watch that step.

1067
00:51:17,377 --> 00:51:18,639
Wait a minute.

1068
00:51:18,678 --> 00:51:20,646
They're having a lover's quarrel
in front of us.

1069
00:51:22,048 --> 00:51:24,642
That unworthiest
of worthies...

1070
00:51:24,684 --> 00:51:26,049

Now, look at that.

1074
00:51:32,825 --> 00:51:33,883
Wait a minute.

00:51:33,927 --> 00:51:37,192
Yeah... right there,

1076
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:38,197
Castor!

1077
00:51:38,231 --> 00:51:39,323
Oh, my son! Castor!

1078
00:51:39,365 --> 00:51:41,230
Make a man outta yourself.

1079
00:51:41,267 --> 00:51:42,996
Mom, Pop, l'm gonna fight him.

1080
00:51:43,036 --> 00:51:44,003
Whoops.

1081
00:51:44,037 --> 00:51:45,231
Don't go!

1082
00:51:45,271 --> 00:51:46,295
Oh, it's my baby.

1083
00:51:46,339 --> 00:51:48,398
Get out--
Get my baby outta there!

1084
00:51:48,441 --> 00:51:49,738
Don't touch his feet!

1085
00:51:49,776 --> 00:51:51,801
He's gotta dance
with those feet.

1086
00:51:56,049 --> 00:51:58,313
Castor, we go home now.

1087
00:51:58,351 --> 00:51:59,648
Olive,
do something about this.

1088
00:51:59,686 --> 00:52:00,653
What are you, a nut?

1089
00:52:00,687 --> 00:52:01,745
What good are you, Olive?

1090
00:52:01,788 --> 00:52:03,756
You get in there and get your
brother out of this!

1091
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:05,087
l can't stand
much more of this.

1092
00:52:05,124 --> 00:52:06,921
Where are my pills?

1093
00:52:06,993 --> 00:52:08,017
Don't do this!

1094
00:52:08,061 --> 00:52:09,926
Mr. Geezil,
get him outta there, Geezil!

1095
00:52:10,029 --> 00:52:11,860
Gentlemen, you know the rules:

1096
00:52:11,898 --> 00:52:13,024
There are no rules.

1097
00:52:13,066 --> 00:52:14,966
This is a fight to the finish.

1098
00:52:17,103 --> 00:52:18,661
First man who is dead, loses.

1099
00:52:18,705 --> 00:52:20,070
Good luck to both of you.

1100
00:52:20,106 --> 00:52:21,573
Did you see what he was doing?!

1101
00:52:21,608 --> 00:52:23,235
-You didn't see?!
-Good luck to you.

1102
00:52:23,276 --> 00:52:24,243
l hate you to pieces!

1103
00:52:24,277 --> 00:52:25,539
All right, come over here.

1104
00:52:25,578 --> 00:52:27,443
Now don't, don't kill him.

1105
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,175
Just fluff him up a bit.

1106
00:52:33,519 --> 00:52:35,987
You'll be leading
with the left hand.

1107
00:52:36,022 --> 00:52:39,014
Castor! Castor,
get outta there!

1108
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,487
Go for him, right away, son.

1109
00:52:42,528 --> 00:52:43,961
Come on, Castor.

1110

00:52:59,879 --> 00:53:01,608
Come on, hit him,

1113
00:53:01,648 --> 00:53:02,910
Hang him!

1114
00:53:02,949 --> 00:53:04,246
Come on, Castor.

1115
00:53:04,283 --> 00:53:05,773
Come on, knock him.

1116
00:53:07,487 --> 00:53:08,852
Oh!

Your name's Castor,

1120
00:53:16,996 --> 00:53:18,429
Come on, sting that whale!

1121
00:53:18,464 --> 00:53:20,261
Don't make him mad, Castor.

1122
00:53:22,468 --> 00:53:23,628
He's not a person!

1123

00:53:28,474 --> 00:53:30,408
Kick him!

1126
00:53:31,878 --> 00:53:33,209

00:53:41,988 --> 00:53:43,182

Oh, you'll be murdered.

1145
00:54:31,437 --> 00:54:34,497
All right, gentlemen,

00:54:36,209 --> 00:54:38,609
Touch gloves
and come out fighting.

1148
00:54:38,644 --> 00:54:39,611
What are you afraid of?

1149

1159
00:54:58,564 --> 00:55:00,498

with your mind?

1160
00:55:00,533 --> 00:55:02,364
Give him a karate chop!

1161
00:55:13,579 --> 00:55:14,910
Very good.

1162
00:55:14,981 --> 00:55:16,915
Fist... that's fighting.

1163
00:55:16,983 --> 00:55:18,177
You can take him!

1164
00:55:25,925 --> 00:55:27,222
Don't you dare!

1165
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:28,591
-Hey, your mudder's here?

1169
00:55:34,333 --> 00:55:35,322
You see?

1170
00:55:35,368 --> 00:55:37,666
You're letting his
mother's be distracting you.

1171
00:55:37,703 --> 00:55:38,863
Not be doing that.

He's got my eyes.

lt's a soup burger.

1239
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:30,155
These are difficult times.

1240
01:00:30,195 --> 01:00:31,423
Burgers can't be choosers.

1241
01:00:31,463 --> 01:00:32,589
Phooey.

1242

Work is what is making
the heart grow stronger. Come.

01:00:35,768 --> 01:00:37,030
Open wide.

1244

Bye, Mom.

01:00:38,103 --> 01:00:39,798
Ow!

1246
01:00:39,838 --> 01:00:41,533
Worry, worry, worry.

1247
01:00:43,375 --> 01:00:44,501
Now... there!

1248
01:00:44,543 --> 01:00:46,602
Well, hope the taxes
don't come to too much.

1249
01:00:46,645 --> 01:00:50,342
Oh, the main thing is
that you're all right.

1250
01:00:50,382 --> 01:00:52,680
Yeah.

1251
01:00:52,718 --> 01:00:53,912
Well, were you worried

1252
01:00:53,986 --> 01:00:57,217
that l might have gotten killed
or something, maybe, yeah?

1253
01:00:57,256 --> 01:00:58,416
Oh, Popeye, don't be silly.

1254
01:00:58,457 --> 01:00:59,788
l knew.

1255
01:00:59,825 --> 01:01:02,419
Oh, you... you didn't
have no confidenkce.

1256
01:01:02,461 --> 01:01:03,587
Oh, l did, too.

1257
01:01:03,629 --> 01:01:04,687
Mm-hmm, yeah.

1258
01:01:04,730 --> 01:01:05,788
l did, too.

1259
01:01:05,831 --> 01:01:06,923
After l asked Swee'pea.

1260
01:01:06,965 --> 01:01:08,091
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1261
01:01:08,133 --> 01:01:09,259
That's rich.

1262
01:01:09,301 --> 01:01:11,531
Oh, you're gone now.
You're really a dizzy dame.

1263
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:12,798
Oh, l asked Swee'pea,

1264
01:01:12,838 --> 01:01:13,930
and he told me.

1265
01:01:14,039 --> 01:01:15,301
lsn't that so?

1266
01:01:20,446 --> 01:01:22,380
What's this here?

1267
01:01:22,414 --> 01:01:24,439
See, l asked Swee'pea,

1268
01:01:24,483 --> 01:01:27,350
''Swee'pea,
will Popeye be killed?''

1269
01:01:27,386 --> 01:01:28,853
-Uh-uh.
-No?

1270
01:01:28,887 --> 01:01:32,186
So then l asked,

1271
01:01:32,224 --> 01:01:35,523
''Swee'pea, will Popeye
be seriously maimed?''

1272
01:01:37,229 --> 01:01:38,457
No?

1273
01:01:39,998 --> 01:01:40,896
That's two for two.

1274
01:01:40,999 --> 01:01:42,796
That could happen
to anybody, ya know.

1275
01:01:42,835 --> 01:01:46,635
So then l queried, ''Swee'pea,

1276
01:01:46,672 --> 01:01:48,867
will Popeye actually survive?''

1277
01:01:50,776 --> 01:01:52,505
Yeah, l survived.
Yeah, yeah.

1278
01:01:52,544 --> 01:01:54,136
''What? You mean he'll win?''

1279
01:01:55,347 --> 01:01:56,575
Oh!

1280
01:01:56,615 --> 01:01:58,207
That's-that's a neat trick.

1281
01:01:58,250 --> 01:02:01,777
Oh-ho, me infant
is a psychic of profiks.

1282
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:03,617
lf l didn't see it
with me own eye,

1283
01:02:03,655 --> 01:02:04,883
l wouldn't believe it.

1284
01:02:04,923 --> 01:02:06,914
That kid's a regular forecaster.

1285
01:02:06,959 --> 01:02:09,792
Remind me to ask him
about gold futures.

1286
01:02:09,828 --> 01:02:13,320
More interested in talking to
him about immediate futures.

1287
01:02:13,365 --> 01:02:14,332
Uh, Popeye?

1288
01:02:14,366 --> 01:02:15,492
Yeah?

1289
01:02:15,534 --> 01:02:17,024
He's an adorable
little fellow.

1290
01:02:17,069 --> 01:02:18,934
And he's a psychic, too.
Ain't that the truth.

1291
01:02:18,971 --> 01:02:20,666
But he looks
a little peaked to me.

1292
01:02:20,706 --> 01:02:23,174
He needs some air.

1293
01:02:23,208 --> 01:02:26,302
Air? That's all
we have here is air.

1294
01:02:26,345 --> 01:02:27,937
With your permission, Popeye,

1295
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:29,607
l'll... take him
for a little walk.

1296
01:02:29,648 --> 01:02:30,615
Well, Wimpy, why not?

1297
01:02:30,649 --> 01:02:32,048
l mean, you're like his uncle.

1298
01:02:32,084 --> 01:02:33,210
You're his Uncle Wimp.

1299
01:02:34,286 --> 01:02:35,583
Yeah, that's it.

1300
01:02:35,621 --> 01:02:36,679
Come along.

1301
01:02:36,722 --> 01:02:38,053
Hey, don't forget
his little hat here.

1302
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:39,057
Don't forget his hat.

1303
01:02:39,091 --> 01:02:40,058
He's going out in uniform.

1304
01:02:40,092 --> 01:02:41,059
Oh, of course.

1305
01:02:41,093 --> 01:02:42,060
There you go.

1306
01:02:42,094 --> 01:02:43,061
Thank you.

1307
01:02:43,095 --> 01:02:44,084
Ain't that something?

1308
01:02:44,129 --> 01:02:45,153
He's taking him for a walk.

1309
01:02:45,197 --> 01:02:46,186
Hey!

1310
01:02:46,231 --> 01:02:47,357
Hey, wait a minute there.

1311
01:02:47,399 --> 01:02:48,730
You trying to pull a fask one?

1312
01:02:48,767 --> 01:02:49,734
He can't walks yet.

1313
01:02:49,768 --> 01:02:51,030
Oh, l'll carry him.

1314
01:02:51,069 --> 01:02:52,866
Oh, in that case,
it's all right then.

1315
01:02:52,905 --> 01:02:55,237
As long as you take him
for a drags or something.

1316
01:02:55,274 --> 01:02:56,901
Hey, l want to carry him
for a walk.

1317
01:02:56,942 --> 01:02:58,136
Oh, leave him be there, Olive.

1318
01:02:58,177 --> 01:03:00,702
lt's Uncle Wimps
going with the Swee'pea.

1319
01:03:00,746 --> 01:03:03,180
Oh, yeah, Wimpy can take
him but l can't? Hmm.

1320
01:03:03,215 --> 01:03:04,648
Well, um...

1321
01:03:04,683 --> 01:03:06,651
wh-who says you can't?

1322
01:03:06,685 --> 01:03:08,414
You said l can't. Hmm.

1323
01:03:08,453 --> 01:03:10,921
Oh. Well, um...

1324
01:03:10,989 --> 01:03:12,718
that was before.

1325
01:03:12,758 --> 01:03:14,749
Before what?

1326
01:03:14,793 --> 01:03:17,421
Well, um...

1327
01:03:17,462 --> 01:03:22,593
before l... l knew
you was worried about me.

1328
01:03:22,634 --> 01:03:24,534
Oh!

1329
01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:25,594
Oh.

1330
01:03:25,637 --> 01:03:27,867
You mean, now l can carry him

1331
01:03:27,906 --> 01:03:30,306
just because
l was worried about you?

1332
01:03:30,342 --> 01:03:31,866
Yes. Yes, mm-hmm.

1333
01:03:31,910 --> 01:03:34,344
Phooey.

1334
01:03:34,379 --> 01:03:35,539
Phooey?

1335
01:03:35,581 --> 01:03:36,980
Mm.

1336
01:03:37,015 --> 01:03:38,505
Y-You said ''phooey'' to me?

1337
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:41,417
l said ''phooey''
and l mean ''phooey.''

1338
01:03:41,453 --> 01:03:42,681
Phooey.

1339
01:03:46,825 --> 01:03:48,452
She said ''phooey'' to me.

1340
01:03:48,493 --> 01:03:50,222
She said...

1341
01:03:50,262 --> 01:03:52,526
''phooey'' to me.

1342
01:03:59,938 --> 01:04:01,906
We have Lickety Split,
number one.

1343
01:04:01,974 --> 01:04:04,204
Number three, Sandcrab.

1344
01:04:04,243 --> 01:04:05,335
How 'bout six?

1345
01:04:06,445 --> 01:04:07,503
Everything's going
to be all right.

1346
01:04:07,546 --> 01:04:08,604
Now, he's with
his Uncle Wimps,

1347
01:04:08,647 --> 01:04:10,239
and they've only been gone
for a couple of hours.

1348
01:04:10,282 --> 01:04:11,249
Yeah, couple of hours.

1349
01:04:11,283 --> 01:04:12,580
Ooh, wait a minute.

1350
01:04:12,618 --> 01:04:14,108
This town could have been
built in a couple of hours.

1351
01:04:14,152 --> 01:04:15,278
Whoo!

1352
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:17,254
Oh, got to be trustworthy.
Wimps is trustworthy.

1353
01:04:17,289 --> 01:04:19,587
Wait a minute, l don't trust him
as far as l can throw him.

1354
01:04:19,625 --> 01:04:20,922
Throw him?
l can't even lift him.

1355
01:04:20,959 --> 01:04:22,119
l don't see them anywhere.

1356
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:24,492
Well, maybe they went
to the Rough House.

1357
01:04:24,529 --> 01:04:26,292
No, Wimpy's barred
from the Rough House.

1358
01:04:26,331 --> 01:04:27,298
-Bad credit.
-Right.

1359
01:04:27,332 --> 01:04:29,892
Oh, my stars and horses!

1360
01:04:29,935 --> 01:04:31,732
Derby day?

1361
01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:33,465
That rat Wimpy.

1362
01:04:33,505 --> 01:04:34,972
What's this got to do
with me Swee'pea?

1363
01:04:35,007 --> 01:04:36,372
They've gone to the races.

1364
01:04:36,408 --> 01:04:38,137
A baby at the horse races.

1365
01:04:38,176 --> 01:04:39,609
Where is these races?

1366
01:04:39,645 --> 01:04:41,272
Come on. Let's go.

1367
01:04:47,686 --> 01:04:50,712
Come on! Come on!

1368
01:04:59,164 --> 01:05:01,189
Oh!

1369
01:05:13,011 --> 01:05:14,376
And the winner is...

1370
01:05:14,413 --> 01:05:16,381
Cat's Pajamas.

1371
01:05:16,415 --> 01:05:17,541
Yippee!

1372
01:05:17,582 --> 01:05:19,379
We've done it.

1373
01:05:19,418 --> 01:05:20,908
Oh, that Wimps.

1374
01:05:20,986 --> 01:05:23,045
Abducticating me Swee'pea there.

1375
01:05:23,088 --> 01:05:25,113
Oh, a race track
ain't no nurskery.

1376
01:05:25,157 --> 01:05:27,387
Oh, patience, patience.

1377
01:05:27,426 --> 01:05:28,393
Got to remain calm.

1378
01:05:28,427 --> 01:05:29,758
That's it.

1379
01:05:29,795 --> 01:05:30,921
Straight ahead.

1380
01:05:34,433 --> 01:05:35,900
Lonesome, chubby?

1381
01:05:42,407 --> 01:05:43,567
We've got it. Look.

1382
01:05:43,608 --> 01:05:45,405
The Wax Doors and Gardeners?

1383
01:05:45,444 --> 01:05:47,969
No. Number two, Ed.

1384
01:05:48,013 --> 01:05:49,002
Ed?

1385
01:05:49,047 --> 01:05:50,412
That's a horse.

1386
01:05:50,449 --> 01:05:53,441
All right...
number six, Holy Moly.

1387
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:56,251
You like Holy Moly?

1388
01:05:56,288 --> 01:05:57,414
Holy Moly?

1389
01:05:57,456 --> 01:05:59,151
Holy Moly.

1390
01:05:59,191 --> 01:06:00,556
That's it, Holy Moly.

1391
01:06:00,592 --> 01:06:01,786
We can't lose.

1392
01:06:01,827 --> 01:06:03,852
Everything on Holy Moly.

1393
01:06:15,474 --> 01:06:16,600

Oh, what is this?

1401
01:06:37,896 --> 01:06:39,193
A house of ill repukes?

1402
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:43,861
Ooh, who'd bring me infant
to this den of immoraliky?

1403
01:06:43,935 --> 01:06:46,028
Don't touch nothin'. You might
get a venerable disease.

1404
01:06:46,071 --> 01:06:47,470
Oh. Ooh. Ooh!

1405
01:06:47,506 --> 01:06:49,531
ls that a bed pole you got
in your pocket, handsome?

1406
01:06:49,574 --> 01:06:51,769
Hello. Better grab me loins up
for this one.

1407
01:06:51,810 --> 01:06:53,243
Read your paper, Cole.

1408
01:06:55,614 --> 01:06:57,377
Will you...?

1409
01:06:57,416 --> 01:07:00,078
You know, if Mom caught me
in here she'd kill me.

1410
01:07:00,118 --> 01:07:01,881
There's Mom.

1411
01:07:01,987 --> 01:07:03,511
Where is that Wimpy?

1412
01:07:05,924 --> 01:07:07,118
Oh!

-There he is.

1418
01:07:19,271 --> 01:07:20,238
Wimpy, l'm disgustapated.

1419
01:07:20,272 --> 01:07:21,899
May l borrow the infant
for just a moment here?

1420
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:23,100
Oh, well, yes,
for just a moment.

1421
01:07:23,141 --> 01:07:24,438
l don't want
your little sweet peepers

1422
01:07:24,476 --> 01:07:25,568
to see what's about to happen.

1423
01:07:25,610 --> 01:07:27,077
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

1424
01:07:27,112 --> 01:07:29,376
l ought to bust you

1425
01:07:29,414 --> 01:07:31,211
Yeah, what is this?

You won 120 simoleons?

1428
01:07:34,886 --> 01:07:36,410
You know how many hamburgers
that is?

1429
01:07:36,455 --> 01:07:37,717
Put your eye
where your ear is.

1430
01:07:37,756 --> 01:07:38,848
Disgraceful.
How many races?

1431
01:07:38,957 --> 01:07:40,117
Two races.

1432
01:07:40,158 --> 01:07:42,092
Hmm, let me see
that racing form.

1433
01:07:42,127 --> 01:07:44,027
Oh, maybe we can...

01:07:44,062 --> 01:07:45,757
Oh, Swee'pea?
We, oh... oh, now...

1435
01:07:45,797 --> 01:07:47,128
Wait, no.
No child of mine

1436
01:07:47,165 --> 01:07:48,462

a raceking kout.

1437
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:49,467

What are you doing there?

1441
01:07:57,242 --> 01:07:58,709
No childs of mine
will be exploiticated

1442
01:07:58,743 --> 01:07:59,710

Yeah, that's true.

1444
01:08:00,745 --> 01:08:02,178
You're going to be
a president one day.

1445
01:08:02,214 --> 01:08:03,772
lt is not ill-gotten,
it's good-gotten gains.

1446

These gains with cloth us
and feed us and save us.

1447
01:08:05,584 --> 01:08:07,381
Wrong is wrong even
when it helps you.

1448
01:08:07,419 --> 01:08:08,511
The horses are at the gate.

1449
01:08:08,553 --> 01:08:11,989
Oh, family is more important
than dumb morality, hmm.

1450
01:08:12,023 --> 01:08:14,150
Oh, look, he's got

01:08:33,578 --> 01:08:35,136

Maybe not, but l knows
what law suitks me.

01:09:20,725 --> 01:09:23,250
Top to me bottoms
from the bottoms to me top

1481
01:09:23,295 --> 01:09:25,889
That's the way it is
till the day that l drop

1482
01:09:25,931 --> 01:09:28,399
What am l?

1483
01:09:28,433 --> 01:09:30,628
l yam what l yam

1484
01:09:32,270 --> 01:09:34,170
l yam what l yam

1485
01:09:34,205 --> 01:09:35,900
Here he comes.
Come on, Sucking Lemon.

1486
01:09:35,941 --> 01:09:36,908
What l yam, what l yam

1487
01:09:36,942 --> 01:09:38,204
Oh, come on, get up there. Ooh!

1488
01:09:38,243 --> 01:09:39,369
Wondered about meself.

1489
01:09:39,411 --> 01:09:41,436
To be or not to be--
who's axskin'?

1490
01:09:41,479 --> 01:09:44,573
l can open up an ockean,
l can take a lot of sail

1491
01:09:44,616 --> 01:09:48,017
l can lose a lot of waters,
and l'll never have to bail

1492
01:09:48,053 --> 01:09:50,283
On the coast of Madagascar,
grab a whale by the tail

1493
01:09:50,322 --> 01:09:51,289
Boy, let's go get it.

1494
01:09:51,323 --> 01:09:52,585
What am l?

1495
01:09:52,624 --> 01:09:54,751
What am l?

1496
01:09:54,793 --> 01:09:56,090
l yam what l yam!

1497
01:09:56,127 --> 01:09:58,925
l'm Popeye, the sailor

1498
01:09:59,030 --> 01:10:01,760
l'm Popeye, the sailor

1499
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:04,268
l'm Popeye, the sailor

1500
01:10:04,302 --> 01:10:06,930
l yam what l yam,
and that's all that l yam

1501
01:10:06,972 --> 01:10:09,770
l yam what l yam
what l yam what l yam

1502
01:10:09,808 --> 01:10:12,242
l'm Popeye, the sailor man.

1503
01:10:12,277 --> 01:10:13,608
Ha-ha!

1504
01:10:13,645 --> 01:10:16,910
Whoo, hoo-hoo!

1505
01:10:19,985 --> 01:10:22,419
Arms, don't fail me now.

1506
01:10:33,832 --> 01:10:37,097
l am what l am
and that's all that l am

1507
01:10:37,135 --> 01:10:39,831
l'm Popeye, the sailor man.

1508
01:10:41,106 --> 01:10:45,600
Whoo, hoo-hoo!

1509
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:07,894
Whoo, hoo-hoo!

1510
01:11:12,032 --> 01:11:13,693
Oh, l hate to do this,
Swee'pea,

1511
01:11:13,733 --> 01:11:15,530
but it's neskessary.

1512
01:11:15,569 --> 01:11:17,764
Sometimes you got to do things
you don't want to do

1513
01:11:17,804 --> 01:11:19,135
when you got to do 'em, but...

1514
01:11:19,172 --> 01:11:20,298
Oh, it's cruel, Mr. Eye...

1515
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:22,308
lt may not make sense now
but maybe later.

1516
01:11:22,342 --> 01:11:23,969
...uh, Mr. Pop...
um, Mr. Popeye.

1517
01:11:24,010 --> 01:11:25,500
l'm sorry, Mrs. Oyl,

1518
01:11:25,545 --> 01:11:28,480
but it's parenk's duty
to protect me adopticated son

1519
01:11:28,515 --> 01:11:29,482
from child abusk.

1520
01:11:29,516 --> 01:11:30,983
Oh, oh, but think of Olive.

1521
01:11:31,017 --> 01:11:34,783
You can't take the poor baby
away from poor Olive.

1522
01:11:34,821 --> 01:11:36,118
Me moraliky ain't bilge,
Mrs. Oyl.

1523
01:11:36,156 --> 01:11:37,817
Me mind is set,
and when me mind is set,

1524
01:11:37,857 --> 01:11:39,688
l don't think from nothin'.

1525
01:11:39,726 --> 01:11:40,715
You sure about that?

1526
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:41,886
Yeah, l think so, yes.

1527
01:11:44,464 --> 01:11:46,091
Maybe we owe him an apology.

1528
01:11:46,132 --> 01:11:48,794
We'll find another place
to plant ourselves. Yeah.

1529
01:11:49,970 --> 01:11:51,164
Me, l'll check you, okay?

1530
01:11:51,204 --> 01:11:53,536
Yeah, you all right there?
This ain't bad, is it?

1531
01:11:53,573 --> 01:11:55,438
lt ain't the Ritz,
but at least you get

1532
01:11:55,475 --> 01:11:57,067
a little womb service here, huh?

1533
01:11:58,545 --> 01:12:00,240
lt ain't no palatkial
mansion either,

1534
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:01,269
but we got something.

1535
01:12:01,314 --> 01:12:03,282
Best l ever saw.

1536
01:12:03,316 --> 01:12:04,613
lt's got your blankets here.

1537
01:12:04,651 --> 01:12:05,777
Yeah, there we goes.

1538
01:12:05,819 --> 01:12:06,786
Got your blankets.

1539
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:07,844
Here we go.

1540
01:12:07,887 --> 01:12:09,582
You moved out of the Oyl's?

1541
01:12:09,623 --> 01:12:11,113
None of your business.

1542
01:12:11,157 --> 01:12:12,590
$4.25, moving out tax.

1543
01:12:12,626 --> 01:12:15,459
Nuts to you,
and nuts to your taxes.

1544
01:12:15,495 --> 01:12:16,621
You moved in here?

1545
01:12:16,663 --> 01:12:17,789
What's it look like?

1546
01:12:17,831 --> 01:12:18,957
$5.25, moving-in tax.

1547
01:12:19,032 --> 01:12:20,624
Oh, don't forget double nuts.

1548
01:12:20,667 --> 01:12:22,157
And where's this baby
come from?

1549
01:12:22,202 --> 01:12:23,669
Oh, this pelican's
brought him.

1550
01:12:23,703 --> 01:12:26,763
89 cents--
unlicensed baby tax.

1551
01:12:26,806 --> 01:12:28,865
Oh, get out of here!

1552
01:12:28,908 --> 01:12:29,875
Don't take me personal.

1553
01:12:29,909 --> 01:12:30,739
Hey, oh-oh, oh, no!

1554
01:12:43,323 --> 01:12:48,522
Hoop... hoop... hoopla!

1555
01:12:48,561 --> 01:12:49,926
Did ya see that,
what he did?

1556
01:12:49,963 --> 01:12:51,726
A whole lot of peoples.

1557
01:12:58,638 --> 01:13:00,401
Oh, thank you.

1558
01:13:07,981 --> 01:13:09,573
Go tax the fishes!

1559
01:13:44,284 --> 01:13:47,583
Swee'pea? Swee'pea? Swee'pea?

1560
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:50,589
Where's Swee'pea?

1561
01:13:50,623 --> 01:13:52,454
Swee'pea!

1562
01:13:54,260 --> 01:13:57,593
Where's Swee'pea?!

1563
01:13:57,630 --> 01:13:59,689
Swee'pea!

1564
01:13:59,733 --> 01:14:04,227
Swee'pea!

1565
01:14:34,934 --> 01:14:39,564
lt's me own fault
Swee'pea's been kidnapped.

1566
01:14:39,606 --> 01:14:41,540
Olives was right.

1567
01:14:41,574 --> 01:14:46,739
Even an orphan needs
a mudder and a fadder.

1568
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:48,304
Oh..

1569
01:14:48,348 --> 01:14:50,316
lf l was going to
be Swee'pea's mudder,

1570
01:14:50,350 --> 01:14:52,750
l should have at least
let her be his fadder.

1571
01:14:52,786 --> 01:14:55,414
Ovisk ovisk.

1572
01:14:55,455 --> 01:14:56,615
Oh...

1573
01:14:56,656 --> 01:15:00,422
l ain't man enough
to be a mudder.

1574
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:04,260
And all at once l knew,
l knew at once

1575
01:15:04,297 --> 01:15:07,789
l knew he needed me

1576
01:15:11,971 --> 01:15:18,638
Until the day l die, l won't
know why l knew he needed me

1577
01:15:23,149 --> 01:15:25,242
lt could be fantasy

1578
01:15:25,285 --> 01:15:29,449
Oh-oh

1579
01:15:29,489 --> 01:15:33,255
Or maybe it's because

1580
01:15:33,293 --> 01:15:38,060
He needs me, he needs me,
he needs me, he needs me

1581
01:15:38,097 --> 01:15:41,430
He needs me, he needs me

1582
01:15:46,105 --> 01:15:53,204
Da-da, da, da, da, da,
da-da, da-da, da

1583
01:15:54,647 --> 01:15:57,582
lt's like a dime a dance,
l'll take a chance

1584
01:15:57,617 --> 01:16:01,280
l will because he needs me

1585
01:16:06,125 --> 01:16:09,253
No one ever asked before,
before

1586
01:16:09,295 --> 01:16:12,196
Because
they never needed me...

1587
01:16:12,232 --> 01:16:14,826
But l do.

1588
01:16:14,868 --> 01:16:17,598
But he does!

1589
01:16:17,637 --> 01:16:22,768
Maybe it's because
he's so alone

1590
01:16:22,809 --> 01:16:28,611
Maybe it's because
he's never had a home

1591
01:16:28,648 --> 01:16:32,311
He needs me, he needs me,
he needs me, he needs me

1592
01:16:32,352 --> 01:16:36,083
He needs me, he needs me

1593
01:16:39,092 --> 01:16:41,720
For once, for once in life

1594
01:16:41,761 --> 01:16:46,061
l finally felt
that someone needed me

1595
01:16:51,271 --> 01:16:56,573
And if it turns out real

1596
01:16:56,609 --> 01:17:01,239
Then love can turn the wheel

1597
01:17:01,281 --> 01:17:03,749
Because he needs me,
he needs me

1598
01:17:03,783 --> 01:17:08,982
He needs me, he needs me,
he needs me, he needs me

1599
01:17:14,494 --> 01:17:19,932
Da-da, da, da, da, da,
da-da, da-da, dum

1600
01:17:19,966 --> 01:17:27,463
Da-da, da, da, da, da,
da-da, da-da, da.

1601
01:18:12,118 --> 01:18:14,609
Bye-bye.

1602
01:18:18,324 --> 01:18:20,918
Dear...

1603
01:18:20,994 --> 01:18:23,053
Swee'peas.

1604
01:18:23,096 --> 01:18:26,588
Everybody's gotta have
somebodys

1605
01:18:26,633 --> 01:18:29,431
Even if it's only mes

1606
01:18:29,469 --> 01:18:32,199
Stops yer cryin', Swee'peas

1607
01:18:32,238 --> 01:18:35,036
And try to go to sleeps

01:18:35,074 --> 01:18:38,532

1609
01:18:38,578 --> 01:18:41,547
l don't knows if you cares

1610
01:18:41,581 --> 01:18:44,379
You could've come
from Heavens

1611
01:18:44,417 --> 01:18:47,386
Or a typhoon anywhere

1612
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:53,723
Well, me, l came from Heaven
of Cuddly Na-La Lagoon

1613
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:59,892
And l was told me mammy
gave me up in a typhoon

1614
01:18:59,932 --> 01:19:02,765
Well, don't you cry,
little Swee'pea

1615
01:19:02,802 --> 01:19:06,238
You and me,
we's both the same

1616
01:19:06,272 --> 01:19:08,900
And the biggest tear
l ever seen

1617
01:19:08,941 --> 01:19:12,399
Came in the eye
of a hurricane

1618
01:19:12,445 --> 01:19:18,111
Go to sleep, sleep, sleepy,
now tell me what you sees

1619
01:19:18,151 --> 01:19:24,954
And someday when you's older
l'll tell you's all about me.

1620
01:19:26,059 --> 01:19:27,924
''Love...

1621
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:30,952
From Popeye.''

1622
01:19:32,632 --> 01:19:34,395
Oh, oh...

1623
01:20:39,966 --> 01:20:42,730
Let me see, now...

1624
01:20:42,769 --> 01:20:44,737
''Keep out.''

1625
01:20:44,771 --> 01:20:47,604
Hmm... ''Tax shelter.''

1626
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:49,938
Uh...

1627
01:20:50,042 --> 01:20:51,509
Oh, the Commodore's boat,

1628
01:20:51,544 --> 01:20:53,569
but no Commodore, of course.

1629
01:21:05,921 --> 01:21:09,652
Aha!

1630
01:21:09,692 --> 01:21:10,716
Swee'pea's still
in Sweethaven.

1631
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:11,727
Wimpy!

1632
01:21:11,761 --> 01:21:13,729
-Who are you talking to?
-Uh, uh...

1633
01:21:13,763 --> 01:21:14,991
What did you say about Swee'pea?

1634
01:21:15,097 --> 01:21:16,257
l said nothing!

1635
01:21:16,298 --> 01:21:17,458
Oh!

There's no one home. Let's go.

Kid?

He ain't no Commodores.

1777

A hoity-toity Commodore.

1778
01:26:13,429 --> 01:26:14,555
He would never be that.

1779
01:26:14,596 --> 01:26:15,790
-Oh, a rat.
-Oh.

1780
01:26:15,831 --> 01:26:16,957
-A crook.
-Oh.

1781
01:26:16,999 --> 01:26:18,227
A kidnapper, and a Commodore.

1782

of some dizzy gaming broad.

-That's where they ain't?
-Mm-hmm.

1788
01:26:29,011 --> 01:26:30,137
Well, if that's

1789
01:26:30,179 --> 01:26:31,669
that's where l'm going
to prove that they ain't.

1790
01:26:31,714 --> 01:26:32,681
Oh, come on.
Let's do this.

1791

01:26:46,628 --> 01:26:48,391
but l've a shave
and shampoo awaiting.

1797
01:26:48,430 --> 01:26:49,590
Give 'em hell, Popeye!

1798
01:26:49,631 --> 01:26:50,598
Kick 'em in the butt.

1799
01:26:50,632 --> 01:26:51,929
You can count on me,
Mr. Popeye,

1800
01:26:52,034 --> 01:26:52,932
uh, tomorrow.

1801
01:26:53,035 --> 01:26:54,935
See l'd go with you,
but l got to lock up.

1802
01:26:55,037 --> 01:26:56,834
l just hope

1803
01:26:56,872 --> 01:26:58,737
l'd go with you, Popeye,
but l got us a cold.

1804
01:26:58,774 --> 01:27:00,036
You know l'd go with you...

1805
01:27:00,075 --> 01:27:01,372

1806
01:27:01,410 --> 01:27:02,536

01:27:02,578 --> 01:27:04,170
He's coming.
Revolution is waiting.

1808
01:27:04,213 --> 01:27:05,373
Oh, are you going?

1809
01:27:05,414 --> 01:27:06,506
Heard it's impartial.

Are you going?

-Not me.

of the water, l'd go.

1813
01:27:17,626 --> 01:27:18,820
Make 'em dance, Popeye.

1814
01:27:18,861 --> 01:27:20,726
Almost brought you
a bottle of Pepsi.

1815
01:27:20,763 --> 01:27:21,889
Clean up on 'em, Popeye.

1816
01:27:21,930 --> 01:27:23,761
Nauseating.

1817
01:27:23,799 --> 01:27:25,767
Don't worry,
l'm going with you,

1818
01:27:25,801 --> 01:27:26,768

You're casking shadows

1854
01:29:24,119 --> 01:29:25,484
Pride of the Pacifiric.

1855
01:29:25,521 --> 01:29:26,954
And father to the shark.

1856
01:29:27,022 --> 01:29:28,512
Brother to the piranhaca.

1857
01:29:28,557 --> 01:29:30,422
Cousin to the killer whale.

1858

01:29:39,735 --> 01:29:41,828
No resemblance.

01:29:41,870 --> 01:29:44,134
We-we got the same
squinky eye.

1863

What squinky eye?

That's going to be hard
for you to see. Oh.

1865
01:29:52,047 --> 01:29:54,277
We got the same pipe, Pap.

1866
01:29:54,316 --> 01:29:56,910
You idiot,

1867
01:29:56,952 --> 01:29:59,386

Oh.

1872
01:30:08,530 --> 01:30:09,963
Oh, yes.

1873
01:30:11,466 --> 01:30:13,900
There's one way to prove

1874
01:30:13,936 --> 01:30:16,837
Pick up that can of spinach.

1875
01:30:16,872 --> 01:30:17,998
Pick it up!

1876

01:30:23,145 --> 01:30:24,339
Yeah. Yeah.

01:30:25,647 --> 01:30:26,773
Eat it?

1881
01:30:26,815 --> 01:30:27,941
Eat it.

1882
01:30:27,983 --> 01:30:29,109
Raw?

1883
01:30:29,151 --> 01:30:31,415
Eat it raw.

1884
01:30:32,421 --> 01:30:33,388

1887
01:30:35,424 --> 01:30:36,448

that spinach.

1888
01:30:36,491 --> 01:30:37,617
Oh!

1889
01:30:37,659 --> 01:30:38,956
l don't want to eat
that spinach.

1890
01:30:39,027 --> 01:30:39,959

1891
01:30:39,995 --> 01:30:41,257
Eat that spinach!

1892
01:30:41,296 --> 01:30:45,960
Oh, you disobedient brat.

1893
01:30:46,034 --> 01:30:48,127
You was disobedient
when you was two,

1894
01:30:48,170 --> 01:30:50,070
and you're still
disobedient now!

1895
01:30:50,105 --> 01:30:51,800
You wouldn't eat your spinach.

1896
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:53,831
Spinach what kept
our family strong

1897
01:30:53,875 --> 01:30:55,206
for thousands of years.

1898
01:30:55,243 --> 01:30:57,677
And what does me only
oxspring do with it?

1899
01:30:57,713 --> 01:30:59,146
He spits it up.

1900
01:30:59,181 --> 01:31:00,205
His mother ups and dies,

1901
01:31:00,248 --> 01:31:01,681
and he wouldn't eat his spinach.

1902
01:31:01,717 --> 01:31:02,706
She choked on it, Pop.

1903
01:31:02,751 --> 01:31:03,718
His poppa out of work,

1904
01:31:03,752 --> 01:31:05,185
and he wouldn't eat his spinach.

1905
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:06,312
lt wasn't my fault.

1906
01:31:06,355 --> 01:31:07,822
The whole country
in a depressigan.

1907
01:31:09,091 --> 01:31:10,820
And he wouldn't eat his spinach.

1908
01:31:10,859 --> 01:31:12,156
That was Coolidge, Poppa.

1909
01:31:12,194 --> 01:31:13,422
His poppa going hungry.

1910
01:31:13,462 --> 01:31:14,520
Going off to steal.

1911
01:31:14,563 --> 01:31:15,689
Stealing what?

1912
01:31:15,731 --> 01:31:17,164
Spinach.

1913
01:31:17,199 --> 01:31:21,192
So his ungrate son
could grow up big and strong.

1914
01:31:21,236 --> 01:31:22,328
You know what l done?

1915
01:31:22,371 --> 01:31:24,839
You know what l done
when the G man catched me

1916
01:31:24,873 --> 01:31:25,999

-Yeah. You laughed?

1919
01:31:28,610 --> 01:31:30,237
l laughed a whole year.

1920
01:31:33,882 --> 01:31:35,850
Cut me down
from this yardarm.

1921
01:31:35,884 --> 01:31:37,511
Getting away with that rotten
little insect

1922
01:31:37,552 --> 01:31:38,519
of a stool pigeon.

1923
01:31:38,553 --> 01:31:39,520
Cut you down?

1924
01:31:39,554 --> 01:31:40,543

Well, you said cut you down.

1931

lf you do,
l'll make you eat it.

1939
01:32:10,085 --> 01:32:12,679
You'll be known as

All hands on deck.

1959
01:32:53,462 --> 01:32:55,930
Help, Popeye!

1960
01:32:55,964 --> 01:32:58,296
The wharf, the wharf is moving.

1961
01:32:58,333 --> 01:32:59,732
Shut up, stupid.

1962
01:32:59,768 --> 01:33:00,894
This ain't no wharf.

1963
01:33:00,936 --> 01:33:02,335
This is me getaway boat.

1964
01:33:02,370 --> 01:33:03,701

01:33:16,985 --> 01:33:18,816
Hurry up, Popeye!

1967
01:33:18,854 --> 01:33:20,981
You're falling behind!

1968
01:33:21,089 --> 01:33:23,853
And Bluto's getting away!

1969
01:33:23,892 --> 01:33:25,291

1970
01:33:25,327 --> 01:33:29,093
Help!

1971
01:33:31,332 --> 01:33:33,926
What is it?

1972
01:33:33,968 --> 01:33:35,936
lt's a rock.

1973
01:33:35,970 --> 01:33:38,200
lt's a hard place.

1974
01:33:38,239 --> 01:33:40,673
Oh, no. lt's Scab lsland.

1975
01:33:40,708 --> 01:33:41,800
Mom...

1976
01:33:41,843 --> 01:33:43,538
Don't worry, Castor.

1977
01:33:43,578 --> 01:33:45,671
Your father's with us.

1978

Haul ass, haul ass.

Get to your stations.

1982
01:33:53,288 --> 01:33:54,949
Get to your battle stations.

1983
01:33:54,989 --> 01:33:58,891
Oh... oh, phooey!

1984

What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1985
01:34:02,764 --> 01:34:04,823
Who do you think you are,
Captain Arab?

1986
01:34:04,866 --> 01:34:06,959
l'm trying to save
me Olive Oyl and me Swee'peas.

1987
01:34:07,001 --> 01:34:08,696
Olive Oyl? Swee'pea?

1988
01:34:08,736 --> 01:34:11,102
What are you doing,

01:34:18,012 --> 01:34:19,912
Oh, yeah? Well,

to your fadder?

1997
01:34:24,886 --> 01:34:26,251
You ain't me fadder.

1998
01:34:26,287 --> 01:34:27,447
Me fadder was tall and kind

1999
01:34:27,488 --> 01:34:28,819
and looks like
Abraham Lincoln.

2000
01:34:28,856 --> 01:34:30,824
Yeah, don't tell me what l am.

2001
01:34:30,858 --> 01:34:32,655
Eh? Where'd he go,

2002
01:34:32,694 --> 01:34:33,922
l says l am your fadder.

2003
01:34:34,028 --> 01:34:36,929
l ought to know whose fadder
l is and whose fadder l ain't.

2004
01:34:37,031 --> 01:34:38,089
Who says?

2005
01:34:38,132 --> 01:34:40,191
l said. l said.

2006
01:34:40,234 --> 01:34:42,930
l says avast, you bilge rat,
before l use you as an anchor.

2007
01:34:42,971 --> 01:34:45,098
Bilge rat, bilge rat,
bilge rat?!

2008
01:34:45,139 --> 01:34:46,265
Mutiny, mutiny!

2009
01:34:46,307 --> 01:34:48,298
l am your one and only fadder.

2010
01:34:48,343 --> 01:34:49,435
Look it, look it--

2011
01:34:49,477 --> 01:34:51,672
Eh...
the same bulgy arms.

2012
01:34:51,713 --> 01:34:52,839
No resemblance.

2013
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:55,178
Eh, the same squinky eye, eh?

2014
01:34:55,216 --> 01:34:56,183
What squinky eye?

2015
01:34:56,217 --> 01:34:57,184
The squinky eye.

2016
01:34:57,218 --> 01:34:59,948
Help, Popeye! Oh!

2017
01:35:00,054 --> 01:35:03,683
We even got, we even
got the same pipe. Look!

2018
01:35:05,159 --> 01:35:06,421
This ain't me pipe.

2019
01:35:07,996 --> 01:35:09,224
He took the bait.

2020
01:35:09,263 --> 01:35:12,926
Eh, l've never seen anything
like this before in me life.

2021
01:35:12,967 --> 01:35:15,458
Talking to your
poor old fadder like that.

2022
01:35:15,503 --> 01:35:17,061
You disobedient brat.

2023
01:35:17,105 --> 01:35:19,972
You're spoiled--
that's what you are-- spoiled.

2024
01:35:20,008 --> 01:35:23,739
Children. Children. Kids.

2025
01:35:23,778 --> 01:35:25,871
Eh, phooey!

2026
01:35:25,913 --> 01:35:26,902
Phooey!

2027
01:35:26,948 --> 01:35:29,849
Give them everything they want,

2028
01:35:29,884 --> 01:35:31,112
and what'd you get in return?

2029
01:35:31,152 --> 01:35:33,916
Nothing, nothing.

2030
01:35:33,955 --> 01:35:35,422
Nothing but heartache,

2031
01:35:35,456 --> 01:35:37,549
heartache, sadness,
and miserky.

2032
01:35:37,592 --> 01:35:39,116
And a bad time,
once in a while,

2033
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:41,185
when you try to give them a
bath, and they don't want it.

2034
01:35:41,229 --> 01:35:43,026
And another bad time
when you want to do something

2035
01:35:43,064 --> 01:35:44,929
that you really want to do,
but all they want to do

2036
01:35:44,966 --> 01:35:46,092
is not what you want to do.

2037
01:35:46,134 --> 01:35:47,726
Bless their little hearts.

2038
01:35:47,769 --> 01:35:50,033
lf they were
really made out of gold,

2039
01:35:50,071 --> 01:35:51,732
l'd like to sell them
on the open marketplace.

2040
01:35:51,773 --> 01:35:53,707
l could make me a fortune.

2041
01:35:53,741 --> 01:35:55,072
l could've made us a fortune.
Kids!

2042
01:35:55,109 --> 01:35:59,375
Eh, they don't
know what they're doing.

2043
01:35:59,414 --> 01:36:01,939
Kids, dadblast 'em!

2044
01:36:01,983 --> 01:36:03,280
They're gonna lead you
to ruin.

2045
01:36:03,317 --> 01:36:05,581
That's what they gonna do.
Lead you to ruin.

2046
01:36:05,620 --> 01:36:07,451
They cry at you
when they're young,

2047
01:36:07,488 --> 01:36:08,921
they yell at you
when they're older,

2048
01:36:08,956 --> 01:36:11,151
they borrow from yous
when they're middle-aged,

2049
01:36:11,192 --> 01:36:12,819
and they leave you alone
to die...

2050
01:36:12,860 --> 01:36:14,384
without even paying you back!

2051
01:36:14,429 --> 01:36:17,523
Children. Phooey!

2052
01:36:18,933 --> 01:36:20,195
You give them
everything they want,

2053
01:36:20,234 --> 01:36:21,895
and what do you
get back in return?

2054
01:36:21,936 --> 01:36:23,198
You gets nothing!

2055
01:36:23,237 --> 01:36:25,535
Catch him like
a big, fat lobster.

2056
01:36:25,573 --> 01:36:27,837
Why, they're just smaller
versions of us, you know.

2057
01:36:27,875 --> 01:36:30,207
Well, l'm not so crazy
about me in the first place.

2058
01:36:30,244 --> 01:36:31,802
So why do l want
one of them?

2059
01:36:31,846 --> 01:36:34,644
l'm asking you.
Children.

2060
01:36:34,682 --> 01:36:38,243
Ah, children.
Little children.

2061
01:36:38,286 --> 01:36:39,753
You'll pour
your heart out to them,

2062
01:36:39,787 --> 01:36:41,277
you give them
everything they want,

2063
01:36:41,322 --> 01:36:42,846
give them candy,
and a lot of toys,

2064
01:36:42,890 --> 01:36:43,914
and what do you get back?

2065
01:36:43,958 --> 01:36:45,084
You get a lot of noise.

2066
01:36:45,126 --> 01:36:46,923
Nah-nah-nah-nah, nah, nah.

2067
01:36:46,961 --> 01:36:48,588
My poppa's a mean old man!

2068
01:36:51,899 --> 01:36:54,299
l'm through with children.
l'm through with kids.

2069
01:36:54,335 --> 01:36:57,862
There ain't nothing
l'm never gonna do about it.

2070
01:36:57,905 --> 01:37:00,305
There it is, Pap,
we's got 'em cornered.

2071
01:37:04,078 --> 01:37:07,309
Dad blast
that dirty bilge rat!

2072
01:37:07,348 --> 01:37:08,781
You! You,

2073
01:37:08,816 --> 01:37:10,044

2074
01:37:10,084 --> 01:37:11,278
Come up here.

2075
01:37:11,319 --> 01:37:12,286
Get up here, get up here.

2076
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:15,881
Help! Oh! Help me!

2077
01:37:15,923 --> 01:37:17,550
There she is!

2078
01:37:17,592 --> 01:37:18,889
Haul ass, haul ass.

2079
01:37:18,926 --> 01:37:20,450
Get the cannon
and move it here.

2080
01:37:20,495 --> 01:37:23,692
Come on, haul ass,
haul ass, haul ass.

2081
01:37:23,731 --> 01:37:26,291
Get the cannon
and move it here.

2082
01:37:26,334 --> 01:37:27,631
ln a good position, that's it.

2083
01:37:27,668 --> 01:37:28,965
What are you doing?

2084
01:37:29,070 --> 01:37:30,162
You can't fire that thing.

2085
01:37:30,204 --> 01:37:31,831
There's women and infants
on that boat.

2086
01:37:31,873 --> 01:37:32,840
You stop worrying.

2087
01:37:32,874 --> 01:37:36,071
All l'm gonna do
is fire a warning shot

2088
01:37:36,110 --> 01:37:37,236
right across the bow.

2089
01:37:37,278 --> 01:37:39,678
Don't you thinks
l knows what l'm doing?

2090
01:37:42,350 --> 01:37:44,045
Ah, short, short.

2091
01:37:44,085 --> 01:37:45,518
l was a little short.

2092
01:37:45,553 --> 01:37:46,918
A little short?

2093
01:37:47,021 --> 01:37:48,147
Reload it, reload it.
Reload it.

2094
01:37:48,189 --> 01:37:49,178
No, you don't.

2095
01:37:54,695 --> 01:37:56,890
Dadblast it! l missed!

01:37:58,566 --> 01:38:01,194
Full speed ahead.

2097
01:38:01,235 --> 01:38:03,032
Slow down, Pap,
so we can board her.

2098
01:38:03,070 --> 01:38:04,367
We're not gonna board her.

2099
01:38:04,405 --> 01:38:06,498
l'm gonna ram him.
l'm gonna ram him.

2100
01:38:06,541 --> 01:38:09,169
He's not going to get away
with my treasure.

2101

Me Olive and me Swee'pea

2102
01:38:43,611 --> 01:38:46,808
Ha, ha. Pirate's Cove.

2103
01:38:46,848 --> 01:38:48,509
l should've known it.

2104
01:38:48,549 --> 01:38:51,882
All right, Mr. Mean.

2105
01:38:51,919 --> 01:38:54,581
Oh, 'cause that's gonna be your
name

2106
01:38:54,622 --> 01:38:56,283
from this day forward!

2107
01:38:56,324 --> 01:38:58,884
Yeah, well, you've
broken your bail of straws

2108
01:38:58,926 --> 01:39:01,190
on this camel's back,
and just to think

2109
01:39:01,229 --> 01:39:03,789
that l was ever gonna get
engaged to you again!

2110
01:39:03,831 --> 01:39:05,662
Oh, nevermore, l say.

2111
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:07,395
Nevermore!

2112
01:39:07,435 --> 01:39:09,096
Get the water out of the boat!

2113
01:39:09,136 --> 01:39:11,127
Lower the lifeboats.
All women first.

2114
01:39:11,172 --> 01:39:13,106
Get the water out of the boat!

2115
01:39:13,140 --> 01:39:14,607
Portly men first!

2116
01:39:23,618 --> 01:39:25,677
Oh, shit!

2117
01:39:29,523 --> 01:39:34,722
