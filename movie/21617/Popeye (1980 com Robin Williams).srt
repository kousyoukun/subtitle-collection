1
00:00:21,234 --> 00:00:24,670
Hey, what's this,
one of Bluto's tricks?

2
00:00:24,705 --> 00:00:26,730
l'm in the wrong movie.

3
00:02:45,912 --> 00:02:51,748
Sweet Sweethaven

4
00:02:51,785 --> 00:02:57,781
God must love us

5
00:02:57,858 --> 00:03:03,524
We the people

7
00:03:08,802 --> 00:03:14,741
Hooray, hooray, Sweethaven

8
00:03:14,808 --> 00:03:20,576
Flags are wavin'

9
00:03:20,614 --> 00:03:23,082
We're people from the sea

10
00:03:23,116 --> 00:03:26,085
Safe from democracy

11
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:28,883
Sweeter than a melon tree

12
00:03:28,922 --> 00:03:31,550
Put here for you and me

13
00:03:34,594 --> 00:03:37,995
Sweethaven

14
00:03:38,031 --> 00:03:43,628
Sweet Sweethaven

15
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:49,336
God must love us

16
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:54,336
We the people

17
00:03:54,381 --> 00:03:58,681
Of Sweethaven

18
00:04:15,001 --> 00:04:17,993
God must have landed here

19
00:04:18,038 --> 00:04:20,700
Why else
would he strand us here?

20
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,709
Where the air
is nice and clear

21
00:04:23,743 --> 00:04:26,007
Sweethaven
even sounds so near

22
00:04:26,046 --> 00:04:29,345
To Heaven

23
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:39,257
God will always bless
Sweethaven

24
00:04:43,897 --> 00:04:50,632
God will always
bless Sweethaven

25
00:04:54,574 --> 00:05:02,174
God will always bless
Sweethaven.

26
00:05:21,935 --> 00:05:23,402
You just dock?

27

-l have.
-Uh-huh.

28
00:05:24,638 --> 00:05:26,435
There'll be 25 cents
docking tax.

29
00:05:26,473 --> 00:05:27,872
What for?

30
00:05:27,907 --> 00:05:29,670
Where's your seacraft?

31
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:30,733
lt ain't no seacraft.

32
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,573
lt's me dinghy,
and it's under the wharf.

33
00:05:32,612 --> 00:05:33,670
Aha. Ah, huh.

34
00:05:33,713 --> 00:05:34,737
This your goods?

35
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:35,975
-They is.
-Yeah?

36
00:05:36,016 --> 00:05:37,449
You're new in town, right?

37
00:05:37,484 --> 00:05:39,577
You call this a town?

38
00:05:39,619 --> 00:05:40,745
Yeah.

39
00:05:40,787 --> 00:05:41,947
Well, first of all,

40
00:05:41,988 --> 00:05:43,717
there's 1 7 cents
new-in-town tax.

41
00:05:43,757 --> 00:05:46,419
Then there's 45 cents
rowboat-under-the-wharf tax,

42
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:48,222
and one dollar

43
00:05:48,261 --> 00:05:49,728
lying-around-the-wharf tax.

44
00:05:49,763 --> 00:05:51,754
So, all together,
you owe the Commodore

45
00:05:51,831 --> 00:05:53,059
$1 .87.

46
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:54,259
Ah, who's this Commodore?

47
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,063
That the nature of a question?

48
00:05:56,102 --> 00:05:57,899
There's a nickel question tax.

49
00:05:57,937 --> 00:05:59,768
Oh, forget it.
l see what you're up to here.

50
00:05:59,806 --> 00:06:00,864
Here we go.

51
00:06:00,907 --> 00:06:02,568
Exact change, please.

52
00:06:02,609 --> 00:06:04,702
l'm an exact-change taxman.

53
00:06:04,778 --> 00:06:06,803
Oh. Mmm. Here's a dollar.

54
00:06:06,846 --> 00:06:09,713
Here's a red cent.

55
00:06:09,783 --> 00:06:11,307
Here's a franc.

56
00:06:11,351 --> 00:06:12,579
A peso.

57
00:06:12,619 --> 00:06:13,950
Here's a guilder.

58
00:06:13,987 --> 00:06:15,579
Oh, sorry l'm taking

59
00:06:15,622 --> 00:06:17,146
your time.

60
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,317
There's a dime; there we go.

61
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:20,951
There's one quarter.

62
00:06:20,994 --> 00:06:22,086
Curiosity tax.

63
00:06:22,128 --> 00:06:23,618
Hey, l paid me tax.

64
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:31,695
Oh, tax this, tax that.

65
00:06:31,738 --> 00:06:33,330
Ooh, my nightmare don't...

66
00:06:33,373 --> 00:06:34,965
Mmm, l gets disgustipated.

67
00:06:35,008 --> 00:06:36,532
''Have you paid your tax?''

68
00:06:38,445 --> 00:06:40,242
l got it, l got it.

69
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,747
No, l-l got it.

70
00:06:41,848 --> 00:06:43,645
l got it, l got it.

71
00:06:43,683 --> 00:06:45,742
Don't worry, l got it.

72
00:06:45,785 --> 00:06:47,753
Holy cow.

73
00:06:47,854 --> 00:06:48,946
Looks like me old pipe.

74
00:06:48,988 --> 00:06:50,353
Wonder what it's doing here?

75
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:53,188
What a coinkydink.

76
00:06:57,997 --> 00:06:59,328
Hey! What is this?

77
00:06:59,365 --> 00:07:01,492
This ain't the orchestra pit.

78
00:07:18,084 --> 00:07:19,210
Oh, lookit there.

79
00:07:19,252 --> 00:07:20,685
Nobody seems to care...

80
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,551
You've got so much
to bear, ma'am.

81
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:23,851
Can l...?

82
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,222
Blow me down!

83
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:27,954
That's it, that... !

84
00:07:27,994 --> 00:07:30,554
Oh, it's the wind and air...

85
00:07:30,597 --> 00:07:34,465
Just try to double dare
to... blow me down.

86
00:07:34,501 --> 00:07:36,059
Awk! Wait for me!

87
00:07:36,102 --> 00:07:37,729
Hello, there, mate.
Maybe, uh...

88
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:41,029
Ah, blow me down.

89
00:07:41,074 --> 00:07:42,837
lt's no bother, but...

90
00:07:42,876 --> 00:07:44,343
Look over there--
stranger's coming.

91
00:07:44,377 --> 00:07:45,674
You'd rather not, huh?

92
00:07:45,712 --> 00:07:47,202
Well, that's easy to see.

93
00:07:47,247 --> 00:07:48,839
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm

94
00:07:48,882 --> 00:07:50,713
Wherever l go...

95
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,980
Ooh, nice-looking knees,

96
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:55,078
it does it for me.

97
00:07:55,121 --> 00:07:56,418
Bad news!
Bad, bad, bad news.

98
00:07:56,456 --> 00:07:58,048
Hmm, l don't believe that.

99
00:07:58,091 --> 00:07:59,251
What a lovely day...

100
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:01,157
Well, it's still
a perfect day, but...

101
00:08:01,194 --> 00:08:03,628
Oh, maybe ma'am,
you would like to...

102
00:08:03,663 --> 00:08:05,358
Blow me down again, there.

103
00:08:05,398 --> 00:08:06,956
lt's a lovely place

104
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,628
Think l'd like to stay, but...

105
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:11,068
Stranger in town.

106
00:08:11,104 --> 00:08:12,298
Blow me down.

107
00:08:12,338 --> 00:08:14,067
Somebody roll into town?

108
00:08:14,107 --> 00:08:17,133
Trouble, trouble,
trouble, trouble...

109
00:08:17,177 --> 00:08:19,407
Blow me down--
local glum club.

110
00:08:19,445 --> 00:08:21,072
lt's friendly here...

111
00:08:21,114 --> 00:08:22,206
A little scary, too.

112
00:08:22,248 --> 00:08:23,681
l think l'll spend a year,

113
00:08:23,716 --> 00:08:25,047
Or two, maybe thr...

114
00:08:25,084 --> 00:08:26,984
Whoa, tut-tut-tut.

115
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:31,548
l yam what l yam,
wherever l go

116
00:08:31,591 --> 00:08:34,355
l came from the sea...

117
00:08:34,394 --> 00:08:36,055
Should've got me number,

118
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,689
but no one's looking it up,
ain't it?

119
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,224
Oh...

120
00:08:41,267 --> 00:08:42,359
Good day. . . Good day.

121
00:08:42,402 --> 00:08:43,460
l hate you to pieces!

122
00:08:43,503 --> 00:08:46,028
Kind of a greasy good day,
but that's all right.

123
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,507
Bunch of carrotsk?

124
00:08:51,544 --> 00:08:53,239
No, no.

125
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,541
You ain't got no carrotsk?

126
00:08:54,581 --> 00:08:55,741
What are those, prunes?

127
00:08:55,782 --> 00:08:57,113
Phooey on carrots!

128
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,015
Take broccoli.

129
00:08:59,052 --> 00:09:01,179
l am in the mood for carrotsk.

130
00:09:01,221 --> 00:09:02,620
l need me vitamins.

131
00:09:02,655 --> 00:09:04,054
Phooey on carrots!

132
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,114
Take spinach!

133
00:09:05,158 --> 00:09:07,683
lf l wants spinach,
l'll axk you for spinach.

134
00:09:07,794 --> 00:09:10,126
So, why you didn't say so?

135
00:09:10,163 --> 00:09:12,358
For you, each a dollar.

136
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:13,695
How much is the broccoli?

137
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:14,700
Nickel, maybe dime.

138
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:15,825
And the spinach?

139
00:09:15,869 --> 00:09:16,893
Dime, maybe quarter.

140
00:09:16,936 --> 00:09:18,426
Then how come
carrotsk is a dollar?

141
00:09:18,471 --> 00:09:19,460
Dollar fifty.

142
00:09:19,505 --> 00:09:21,200
You buy what l don't feel
like selling,

143
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:22,230
it'll cost you $2.

144
00:09:23,743 --> 00:09:25,335
All right, here you go.

145
00:09:25,378 --> 00:09:26,902
Uh-uh-uh-uh!

146
00:09:26,946 --> 00:09:29,574
Hey, deadbeat, this is a nickel.

147
00:09:29,616 --> 00:09:32,244
l pays what l feels like paying.

148
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,483
You're not up to no good,
are you?

149
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:38,354
'Cause if you are, there's
a 50-cent up-to-no-good tax.

150
00:09:41,594 --> 00:09:43,357
Come here! Come back!

151
00:09:43,396 --> 00:09:45,523
Seems like everywhere

152
00:09:45,565 --> 00:09:47,533
Lots of people here

153
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:49,467
Try to blow me down...

154
00:09:50,737 --> 00:09:53,399
Unlike the clothes l wear

155
00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:54,599
l haven't...

156
00:09:54,641 --> 00:09:56,131
Careful, there.

157
00:09:56,175 --> 00:09:58,143
What blew him into town?

158
00:09:58,177 --> 00:10:00,145
Oh, the short arm of the law,
huh?

159
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:04,639
Blow me down

160
00:10:04,684 --> 00:10:05,946
Blow me down...

161
00:10:05,985 --> 00:10:07,714
Ow!

162
00:10:07,754 --> 00:10:11,485
Hey, come ba... hey, hey-- ah!

163
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:23,428
Uh, are you the piano tuner

164
00:10:23,469 --> 00:10:25,767
or the man
with the party favor?

165
00:10:25,805 --> 00:10:27,500
You got a room for renk?

166
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,768
What for what?

167
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:32,174
Renk, renk-- your sign says you
got a room for renk.

168
00:10:32,211 --> 00:10:34,577
Oh, my stars and gardens!

169
00:10:34,614 --> 00:10:36,582
My mind was
a million miles away.

170
00:10:36,616 --> 00:10:39,278
Come in before you catch
your death of mud.

171
00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:40,752
''Mud.''

172
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:45,057
''Oyls.'' That explains it.

173
00:10:45,091 --> 00:10:46,581
She's down a quart.

174
00:10:46,626 --> 00:10:49,595
Scums-- l'll find you.

175
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:52,427
Come on, come on!

176
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:57,265
Mmm. Don't make them
like they used to.

177
00:10:58,734 --> 00:11:00,429
Oh, come on.

178
00:11:05,174 --> 00:11:07,165
Oh!

179
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:11,202
l'm sorry, Mother,
but it's ugly.

180
00:11:11,247 --> 00:11:14,182
l ask you, have you ever
seen anything so ugly?

181
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:16,150
l won't be engaged
in this hat.

182
00:11:16,185 --> 00:11:17,482
l heard that.

183
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,112
Don't think
l didn't hear that.

184
00:11:19,155 --> 00:11:20,486
Oh...

185
00:11:20,523 --> 00:11:22,013
She owes me an apology.

186
00:11:22,058 --> 00:11:23,286
Oh... ugly.

187
00:11:23,326 --> 00:11:25,419
There's nothing left to say.

188
00:11:25,461 --> 00:11:26,792
What do you think?

189
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:29,091
l think it's up to you, dear.

190
00:11:29,131 --> 00:11:31,895
Well, what do you think? Ugly.

191
00:11:31,934 --> 00:11:34,459
l think it's a conspiracy.

192
00:11:34,503 --> 00:11:35,800
Oh...

193
00:11:35,871 --> 00:11:38,635
Why would they manufacture
deliberate ugliness

194
00:11:38,674 --> 00:11:40,767
unless they wanted me
to look ugly?

195
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:43,574
lf we find that out,
we find out everything.

196
00:11:43,612 --> 00:11:46,080
There's a stranger
in t... um... ooh...

197
00:11:46,115 --> 00:11:47,207
Oh...

198
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:48,409
l can't get engaged.

199
00:11:48,451 --> 00:11:50,510
You'll have to tell
Bluto; l can't.

200
00:11:50,553 --> 00:11:52,316
We'll have to cancel the party

201
00:11:52,355 --> 00:11:53,447
tomorrow night.

202
00:11:53,489 --> 00:11:54,979
lt's not my fault
that it's so ugly.

203
00:11:56,058 --> 00:11:57,150
What are you doing

204
00:11:57,193 --> 00:11:58,751
listening in on
a private conversation

205
00:11:58,794 --> 00:11:59,920
between me and my mother?

206
00:11:59,962 --> 00:12:02,863
l have a good mind to have
my father call a policeman.

207
00:12:02,898 --> 00:12:05,332
Olive, will you show
Mister... Mister...?

208
00:12:05,368 --> 00:12:06,460
Oh. Popeye, ma'am.

209
00:12:06,502 --> 00:12:07,730
... Mr. Eye

210
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:08,896
the spare room?

211
00:12:08,938 --> 00:12:10,030
Just Popeye, ma'am.

212
00:12:10,072 --> 00:12:11,039
Go upstairs, Mr. Eye.

213
00:12:11,073 --> 00:12:12,233
Olive will show you the room.

214
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:13,206
Thanks.

215
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:15,709
Some kind of asylum here.

216
00:12:15,745 --> 00:12:16,769
Show me a room.

217
00:12:16,812 --> 00:12:18,006
Show me some courtesy

218
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,014
might be nice.

219
00:12:19,048 --> 00:12:20,515
l don't see why
l have to do anything

220
00:12:20,549 --> 00:12:22,016
on the day
before my engagement party

221
00:12:22,051 --> 00:12:23,518
when nothing's ready,
especially me.

222
00:12:23,552 --> 00:12:25,782
And what kind of name is that,
anyway-- Popeye?

223
00:12:25,855 --> 00:12:27,015
Pretty strange.

224
00:12:27,056 --> 00:12:28,921
What kind of name is Olive Oyl?

225
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,119
Sounds like
some kind of lubricants.

226
00:12:32,194 --> 00:12:33,525
Thank you very much, ma'am.

227
00:12:34,597 --> 00:12:36,622
Don't look in that room;
that's my room.

228
00:12:36,665 --> 00:12:38,132
Meant no disrespect there.

229
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:39,498
Ugly, huh?

230
00:12:39,535 --> 00:12:41,332
You owe me an apology.

231
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,496
What?

232
00:12:42,538 --> 00:12:44,301
Wonder who shoved
a feather in his ear?

233
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,307
What'd you say?

234
00:12:45,341 --> 00:12:47,366
Sure is nice weather
you have here.

235
00:12:50,513 --> 00:12:51,810
Your name really Olives?

236
00:12:51,847 --> 00:12:53,144
So what?

237
00:12:53,182 --> 00:12:54,149
Olives Oyl?

238
00:12:55,284 --> 00:12:57,013
You don't look Greek to me.

239
00:12:57,052 --> 00:12:58,212
So, you're short.

240
00:12:58,254 --> 00:13:00,347
Or are you just passing
yourself off as short?

241
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:02,482
Can l see me room now?

242
00:13:02,525 --> 00:13:04,390
Ooh, as if l cared.

243
00:13:04,427 --> 00:13:06,224
Let me give you a hand there.

244
00:13:06,262 --> 00:13:07,229
Maybe it needs a little oil.

245
00:13:07,263 --> 00:13:08,252
Oh!

246
00:13:09,598 --> 00:13:10,860
Oh, oh...

247
00:13:15,237 --> 00:13:18,035
Nice-looking room.

248
00:13:22,111 --> 00:13:25,569
Never seen a room done
in early demolish-kin before,

249
00:13:25,614 --> 00:13:27,104
but this'll do for me.

250
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:29,379
Careful how you treat
that bed.

251
00:13:29,418 --> 00:13:31,181
Nothing goes on this bed.

252
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,482
Sorry, ma'am, it's just some...

253
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:34,489
Watch that lamp!

254
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:36,491
Let me give you some assistance.

255
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:37,890
Here, give me your hand.

256
00:13:37,927 --> 00:13:39,895
There, that's it.
Yeah, here we go.

257
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:41,089
Oh, you're in first.

258
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,792
ls that... oh...
Boy, is it hot in here.

259
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:45,265
l still respect you.

260
00:13:45,301 --> 00:13:46,290
Ooh!

261
00:13:50,739 --> 00:13:52,798
Me bad eye, didn't see that.

262
00:13:52,842 --> 00:13:53,831
Hmph!

263
00:13:58,547 --> 00:13:59,980
Thanks for your help.

264
00:14:00,015 --> 00:14:02,984
Uh, Miss Oyl, maybe...

265
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:14,453
Don't forget to put
the cat out, dear.

266
00:14:14,497 --> 00:14:16,192
We don't have a cat.

267
00:14:16,232 --> 00:14:17,529
Eau de toilette.

268
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:19,329
Yeah, eau de toilette.

269
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:21,699
Yeah.

270
00:14:22,771 --> 00:14:23,863
How do you like that?

271
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:25,703
Gold is up 20 cents,
two dollars an ounce.

272
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:27,003
Out of my kitchen, Mr. Wimpy.

273
00:14:27,042 --> 00:14:28,270
l knew it, l knew it, see...

274
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,607
You wait for the supper gong.

275
00:14:29,645 --> 00:14:31,237
l could've made
a fortune on Billings

276
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,646
if Bluto would've let me go
directly to the Commodore.

277
00:14:33,682 --> 00:14:35,673
He's so jealous of me,
that Bluto.

278
00:14:35,718 --> 00:14:37,413
Well, who wouldn't be?

279
00:14:37,453 --> 00:14:39,182
Me, l'm not jealous of Castor.

280
00:14:39,221 --> 00:14:40,245
He's my son.

281
00:14:40,289 --> 00:14:42,052
Man jealous of his own son.

282
00:14:42,091 --> 00:14:43,581
You owe me an apology.

283
00:14:43,626 --> 00:14:44,786
l didn't mean you.

284
00:14:44,827 --> 00:14:47,523
Never lets me go
to the Commodore.

285
00:14:47,563 --> 00:14:50,031
Commodore is a paragon
of sagacity.

286
00:14:50,065 --> 00:14:52,431
lf ever l could
put in a good word...

287
00:14:52,468 --> 00:14:53,435
''Shut up'' is the word.

288
00:14:53,469 --> 00:14:54,959
''Pass'' is another word
that Wimpy...

289
00:14:55,004 --> 00:14:56,062
You don't pass.

290
00:14:56,105 --> 00:14:58,801
He should be killed to death.

291
00:14:58,908 --> 00:15:01,706
lt says here the Commodore's
taxing salt again.

292
00:15:01,744 --> 00:15:04,235
Don't look as good as l smell,
but too late now.

293
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,611
Got to go.

294
00:15:05,648 --> 00:15:10,278
Oh, Mr. Eye,
have you met-- uh, Pop?

295
00:15:10,319 --> 00:15:11,752
Mr. Wimpy, my son Castor,

296
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,754
Mr. Geezil, my husband Cole.

297
00:15:13,822 --> 00:15:15,915
We're all one big
happy family here.

298
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,926
-Hmph!
-Although not really.

299
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,928
l mean, well, Mr. Geezil
and Mr. Wimpy are, um...

300
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:21,259
Me, l'm family.

301
00:15:21,297 --> 00:15:23,356
Well, you're my husband.

302
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:25,299
You owe me an apology.

303
00:15:25,334 --> 00:15:27,768
Well, l can't find anything.

304
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:29,327
What are you
looking for, Olive?

305
00:15:29,371 --> 00:15:30,895
-A glass.
-Oh, uh, here's a glass.

306
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,567
That's a short, fat, ugly glass.

307
00:15:32,608 --> 00:15:34,098
l want a tall, pretty,
slender glass.

308
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,110
They're all broken.

309
00:15:35,144 --> 00:15:36,270
l could've made a fortune

310
00:15:36,312 --> 00:15:37,438
-in fish futures...
-Fish?

311
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,310
but l'd have to dip
into capital.

312
00:15:39,348 --> 00:15:41,316
Fish futures smell.

313
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,750
What kind of glass
do you want, Olive?

314
00:15:43,786 --> 00:15:44,775
A wine glass

315
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,618
or a brandy glass,
or a water glass?

316
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:49,419
Oh, not a thing--
l don't want a thing.

317
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:50,425
Real appetizing.

318
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:51,426
l want a fork.

319
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,552
Right beside your plate.

320
00:15:52,595 --> 00:15:54,290
lf it was a knife,
it would cut you.

321
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,558
-And a knife.
-Will you sit down?

322
00:15:55,598 --> 00:15:57,293
Why don't l have a knife?
And a nice dress?

323
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,857
You owe me an apology.

324
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,560
Passing fish, please.

325
00:16:02,605 --> 00:16:04,095
Fish, excellent idea, Miss Oyl.

326
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:06,004
l would suggest before
matrimony, fish.

327
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,100
Fish before matrimony.

328
00:16:08,143 --> 00:16:10,134
Ooh, that does look good, there.

329
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:12,340
Wish l had a plate though.

330
00:16:12,381 --> 00:16:16,112
...because four times
engaged is three times much.

331
00:16:16,151 --> 00:16:18,483
Oh, he can't talk me out
of anything; l'm not a child.

332
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,748
l'll say you're not a child.

333
00:16:19,788 --> 00:16:22,518
-Who says l'm not a child?
-You said you're not a child

334
00:16:22,558 --> 00:16:23,582
and l agreed with you,
that's who.

335
00:16:23,626 --> 00:16:24,650
Who asked you
to agree with me?

336
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:26,183
Well, no one can stop me
from agreeing with you

337
00:16:26,228 --> 00:16:27,752
-if l want to.
-l can.

338
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:28,990
Quarreling at my table.

339
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:30,464
You both owe me an apology.

340
00:16:30,499 --> 00:16:31,966
Sorry, Pop.

341
00:16:32,001 --> 00:16:32,490
What?

342
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:33,626
Please pass the shrimp,

343
00:16:33,669 --> 00:16:34,761
chicken and meatballs.

344
00:16:34,803 --> 00:16:37,169
Well, l don't know.

345
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:40,175
Captain Bluto has
the patience of Job.

346
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:41,198
Or is it job?

347
00:16:41,243 --> 00:16:43,973
Certainly got
a very good job, Job.

348
00:16:44,013 --> 00:16:46,504
And he needs
a lot of patience.

349
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:48,641
Why, he runs this town
for the Commodore

350
00:16:48,684 --> 00:16:49,651
while he's away.

351
00:16:49,685 --> 00:16:51,118
And the Commodore's
always away.

352
00:16:51,153 --> 00:16:52,950
As a matter of fact,
l've never seen him.

353
00:16:52,988 --> 00:16:54,148
-Have you, Cole?
-What?

354
00:16:54,189 --> 00:16:56,453
l'd never let a girl
break my engagement.

355
00:16:56,492 --> 00:16:59,290
l'd break her nose before
she broke my engagement.

356
00:16:59,328 --> 00:17:02,354
And you better not try on me
what you pulled on Bluto,

357
00:17:02,398 --> 00:17:04,525
because l'm no pushover.

358
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:06,397
You owe your sister
an apology.

359
00:17:06,435 --> 00:17:07,925
Will you stop fidgeting?

360
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,232
Finishing touch here.

361
00:17:09,271 --> 00:17:11,136
Oh, this knife won't cut.

362
00:17:11,173 --> 00:17:12,162
Here, take mine.

363
00:17:12,207 --> 00:17:13,174
Not since l was child

364
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,937
have we had a sharp knife
in this house.

365
00:17:14,977 --> 00:17:16,467
You owe me an apology.

366
00:17:16,512 --> 00:17:17,945
You don't like our knives.

367
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,380
Bluto's rich, he can buy you
plenty of knives.

368
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,884
Ooh, l hate this table,
it's ugly.

369
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:24,317
l'm the only one
with nerve enough

370
00:17:24,353 --> 00:17:25,479
to tell the truth about it.

371
00:17:25,521 --> 00:17:27,546
Well, then, why don't you
let Bluto the pushover

372
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,556
buy you a new table?

373
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,557
-Am l right, Pop?
-Right.

374
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:30,558
l'm right, right?

375
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:31,559
-You're right.
-Right.

376
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:32,753
Nothing left?

377
00:17:32,861 --> 00:17:34,590
Oh... Bluto, Bluto, Bluto.

378
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,394
Everyone takes advantage
of my poor Bluto.

379
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:39,560
Get a new... glass,
a new knife.

380
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:41,501
Now they want a table.
Well, hmph!

381
00:17:41,537 --> 00:17:43,004
That's why l always
have to break off

382
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:44,335
our engagement--
to stop you all

383
00:17:44,373 --> 00:17:45,863
from taking advantage
of the sweetest,

384
00:17:45,908 --> 00:17:47,637
most humble man
on the face of this Earth!

385
00:17:47,676 --> 00:17:48,643
Hmph.

386
00:17:48,677 --> 00:17:49,735
Mmm.

387
00:17:53,248 --> 00:17:54,272
You make me sick.

388
00:17:57,786 --> 00:18:00,721
Never good to be too full,
l guess.

389
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,614
lt's 9:00!

390
00:18:53,656 --> 00:18:55,556
Curfew!

391
00:18:55,591 --> 00:18:58,617
Lights... out!

392
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,637
You can have a kiss now.

393
00:19:16,712 --> 00:19:18,145
Oh!

394
00:19:22,785 --> 00:19:24,309
Poppa.

395
00:19:24,353 --> 00:19:26,082
Pretty soon you and me

396
00:19:26,122 --> 00:19:28,750
are going to be together again,
huh?

397
00:19:28,858 --> 00:19:30,291
Yeah.

398
00:19:30,326 --> 00:19:33,591
30 years ain't that long.

399
00:19:33,629 --> 00:19:37,622
Besides, next Wednesday's
our annual-versity.

400
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:39,328
Yeah? Yeah.

401
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:43,730

That's all l'm axskin you.

403
00:19:49,645 --> 00:19:51,738

00:20:26,482 --> 00:20:28,040
Sweep, sweep...

408

Ah... whoop!

00:20:34,824 --> 00:20:36,621
Eee-oh!

411
00:20:37,727 --> 00:20:41,663
Everything

412
00:20:42,832 --> 00:20:46,165
Everything is food to go

413
00:20:46,202 --> 00:20:51,265
Everything is food
for thought

414
00:20:51,307 --> 00:20:54,470
Everything you knead

415
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:57,809
lt is food

416

00:21:04,687 --> 00:21:08,919
Everything is meat, meat, meat

Careful what you put
on your feet

00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:17,329
Once it lived on an ani-mule

426
00:21:50,766 --> 00:21:54,964
Everything is food to go now

427
00:21:55,004 --> 00:21:58,735
Everything is
fast-food chains

428
00:21:58,774 --> 00:22:02,540
From your lemon
to your sugarcane

430
00:22:06,349 --> 00:22:09,512
Everything is food

Did you order a hamburger?

432
00:22:13,422 --> 00:22:14,787
Yeah, l ordered a hamburger.

433
00:22:14,824 --> 00:22:16,291
That's what l got,
a hamburger.

434
00:22:16,325 --> 00:22:17,292
No, l beg to disagree.

435
00:22:17,326 --> 00:22:18,520
Rough House,

436
00:22:18,561 --> 00:22:19,528

00:22:20,796 --> 00:22:22,093
Who's paying?

439
00:22:22,131 --> 00:22:23,393
l'm buying, he's paying.

440
00:22:23,432 --> 00:22:24,922
A nickel hamburger tax?

441
00:22:24,967 --> 00:22:26,559
l'd refuse to pay
if l were you.

442
00:22:26,602 --> 00:22:27,933
A shocking abuse of power.

443
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:30,268
Rough House!

444
00:22:31,874 --> 00:22:35,332
Food, food, food

446
00:22:38,814 --> 00:22:41,408

00:23:06,108 --> 00:23:08,941
Everything is upside-down

451
00:23:11,013 --> 00:23:14,949
Everything is sunny-side up

452
00:23:14,984 --> 00:23:17,077
Did you pay for this

453
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:19,087
ln American?

454
00:23:19,121 --> 00:23:22,147
They can't trick us
with no hot dog

455
00:23:22,191 --> 00:23:26,127
Everything is food,
food, food

456
00:23:26,162 --> 00:23:29,563
Everything is food.

457
00:23:38,741 --> 00:23:41,039
Hey, hey, hey, Laverne!

Give us a smooch!

459
00:23:45,481 --> 00:23:48,473
l really need someone
to kind of talk to,

460
00:23:48,517 --> 00:23:50,815
'cause l thought everybody
in this town might be deef.

461
00:23:50,886 --> 00:23:51,818
Huh, what's that?

462
00:23:51,887 --> 00:23:52,819
Huh? Oh.

463
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:57,426
You know, jusk why
l'm here is...

464
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,690
l'm looking for me pap.

465
00:23:59,728 --> 00:24:00,695
Yeah, oh...

466
00:24:00,729 --> 00:24:02,458
l've searched
the seven seas for him,

467
00:24:02,498 --> 00:24:04,227
and l haven't found him yet.

468
00:24:04,266 --> 00:24:07,497
l was only two years old,
me own pap left me.

469
00:24:07,536 --> 00:24:09,231
l was just a mere infink.

470
00:24:09,271 --> 00:24:10,636
Me own pap...

471
00:24:10,673 --> 00:24:13,073
Pipe down, will ya?

472
00:24:13,108 --> 00:24:15,372
Me own pap ditches me.

473
00:24:15,411 --> 00:24:16,537
l'm a very tolerant man,

474
00:24:16,579 --> 00:24:18,547
except when it comes
to holding a grudge.

475
00:24:18,581 --> 00:24:20,708
l never thought
l'd forgive me paps,

476
00:24:20,749 --> 00:24:22,239
but about seven years ago,

477
00:24:22,284 --> 00:24:24,878
l ships out on this boat,
The Gloomy Gus.

478
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,651
That's a boat. Yeah.

479
00:24:28,691 --> 00:24:30,386
Just off the coast of Guam.

480
00:24:30,426 --> 00:24:32,018
lt breaks up on this typhoon,

481
00:24:32,061 --> 00:24:34,188
and l'm stuck on
this raft for 45 days

482
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,492
without food or waters.

483
00:24:35,531 --> 00:24:38,193
But after all
this time on this raft,

484
00:24:38,234 --> 00:24:40,293
this visiktation comes to me.

485
00:24:40,336 --> 00:24:45,137
Looks just like me mother,
rest her soul.

486
00:24:45,174 --> 00:24:49,304
And it says,
''Your pap is still alive.''

487
00:24:49,345 --> 00:24:50,277
Excuse me.

488
00:24:51,947 --> 00:24:54,814
So, when l was finally rescued,

489
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:57,375
l figured out that l got
to forgive me paps, you know?

490
00:24:57,419 --> 00:24:58,443
Uh, you see,

491
00:24:58,487 --> 00:25:01,012
l'm only afeared
that he might be dead,

492
00:25:01,056 --> 00:25:03,286
and never realize what a
fine figure of an orphink

493
00:25:03,325 --> 00:25:04,656
l turned out to be.

494
00:25:04,693 --> 00:25:06,923
You sure got a nice-looking
face there,

495
00:25:06,962 --> 00:25:08,862
One-Eye.

496
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:12,057
One-Eye?

He's tall

Not a mandolin

623
00:33:01,133 --> 00:33:03,465
Oh, no

624
00:33:03,502 --> 00:33:05,493
He's an accordion

625
00:33:07,472 --> 00:33:12,136

each night to keep him warm

Oh, boy

00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,221
He's virile

629
00:33:25,257 --> 00:33:26,952
And he's strong

630
00:33:26,992 --> 00:33:28,687

Uh...

635
00:33:34,299 --> 00:33:35,493
Sounds like Fluto.

636
00:33:35,534 --> 00:33:36,694
Bluto.

637
00:33:36,735 --> 00:33:37,963
Bluto.

638
00:33:38,003 --> 00:33:38,970
At your services, sir.

639
00:33:39,004 --> 00:33:40,767
There's a good picture
in the paper this week.

640
00:33:40,806 --> 00:33:41,773
A lovely present for you

641
00:33:41,807 --> 00:33:43,206
down at the pawn shop,
Captain Bluto.

642
00:33:43,241 --> 00:33:44,970
l would have brought it,
but it was too late.

643
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:46,170
Anytime you want me to come by

644
00:33:46,211 --> 00:33:48,145
and stain up the boat,
Captain Bluto.

645
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,841

He's got money and respect

647
00:33:54,152 --> 00:33:55,483
That's true

648
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:00,355
He's better than the rest

649
00:34:00,392 --> 00:34:02,087
That's true

650
00:34:02,127 --> 00:34:06,587
He may not be the best

651
00:34:07,899 --> 00:34:10,026
But he's large

652
00:34:11,269 --> 00:34:12,395
And he's mine...

653
00:34:12,437 --> 00:34:13,631
She can have him.

654
00:34:13,672 --> 00:34:14,798
Yeah.

655
00:34:14,873 --> 00:34:16,431
She loves me.

656
00:34:19,511 --> 00:34:21,479
Of course she does.

657
00:34:21,513 --> 00:34:23,310
She don't love me.

658
00:34:23,348 --> 00:34:24,474
Oh, no.

659
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,614
She'll marry me.

660
00:34:31,957 --> 00:34:34,653

00:34:44,269 --> 00:34:46,203
She won't marry me.

669
00:34:47,272 --> 00:34:48,204
Oh.

670
00:34:52,911 --> 00:34:54,037
She will.

671
00:34:58,316 --> 00:35:00,181
She won't.

672
00:35:07,792 --> 00:35:13,059
lt may seem funny,
but it's not

673
00:35:13,098 --> 00:35:14,793
Oh, no

674
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:17,358
l'm thankful

675
00:35:17,402 --> 00:35:19,427
For what l've got

676
00:35:19,471 --> 00:35:20,699
Me, too

677
00:35:20,739 --> 00:35:25,676
lt may not be a lot

678
00:35:27,078 --> 00:35:30,445
But he's large.

679
00:35:33,652 --> 00:35:34,619
She will.

680
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,378
Yes, yes.

681
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:42,392
She...

682
00:35:46,398 --> 00:35:50,198
Faulty flower...
C-Captain Bluto.

683
00:35:55,307 --> 00:35:57,639
Mrs. Oyl, Olive's...

684
00:35:57,676 --> 00:35:59,644
Olive's what?

685
00:35:59,678 --> 00:36:01,168
Olive's...

686
00:36:02,514 --> 00:36:05,005
...getting ready.

687
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:07,018
Good.

688
00:36:07,052 --> 00:36:08,178
Now, where were we?

689
00:36:08,219 --> 00:36:11,518
Uh, she won't
marry you, she...

690
00:36:15,126 --> 00:36:17,060
She will!

691
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:20,961
Oh, my word!

692
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,432
Son-in-law.

693
00:36:26,972 --> 00:36:28,735
Oh, yeah, yeah.

694
00:36:28,773 --> 00:36:29,933
Ah! Ooh.

695
00:36:53,426 --> 00:36:56,953
Olive!

696
00:37:11,844 --> 00:37:14,005
Marvelous, marvelous.

697
00:37:14,046 --> 00:37:15,638
No place to go.

698
00:37:15,681 --> 00:37:17,672
Can't go to no party
without an invite.

699
00:37:17,717 --> 00:37:18,706
Whoo!

700
00:37:19,819 --> 00:37:21,980
-Ho, ho, ho, whoa.
-Whoo! Ooh.

701
00:37:22,021 --> 00:37:23,318
-Miss Oyl.
-Oh...

702
00:37:23,356 --> 00:37:24,550
You scared the wits out of me.

703
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,387
Yeah, l almost knocked 'em
out of you, too.

704
00:37:26,425 --> 00:37:28,017
-Sorry l did that to you.
-What right do you have

705
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,823
to lurk here in the dark
in the middle of the night

706
00:37:29,929 --> 00:37:31,157
and scare the wits
out of a person?

707
00:37:31,197 --> 00:37:32,994
l wasn't.
l was just, uh, kind of, uh...

708
00:37:33,032 --> 00:37:33,999
Oh, oh.

709
00:37:34,033 --> 00:37:35,830
How's your party going,
Miss Oyl?

710
00:37:35,868 --> 00:37:37,699
-Oh, that's a dumb question.
-Yeah.

711
00:37:37,737 --> 00:37:40,001
Where do you think l'm headed
right this minute?

712
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:41,404
Um... well, uh,

713
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,668
mmm, that way, l think.

714
00:37:42,708 --> 00:37:43,675
Out of town.

715
00:37:43,709 --> 00:37:45,267
-l am not headed out of town.
-Oh.

716
00:37:45,311 --> 00:37:47,472
Don't you see which
direction l'm facing?

717
00:37:47,513 --> 00:37:49,242
-You're going, now you're...
-Oh, ooh, whoa.

718
00:37:49,282 --> 00:37:50,306
-Now you're facing east.
-Oh.

719
00:37:50,349 --> 00:37:51,475
Maybe a little southwest.

720
00:37:51,517 --> 00:37:52,677
-Place your bets.
-Oh. Oh!

721
00:37:52,718 --> 00:37:54,845
You need some help with
your bags there, Miss Oyl?

722
00:37:54,887 --> 00:37:56,252
-Ooh, oh, no.
-l didn't touch ya.

723
00:37:56,289 --> 00:37:57,347
l didn't mean to hurt ya.

724
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,550
Thank you.

725
00:37:58,591 --> 00:38:00,024
-Oh, you do.
-Oh.

726
00:38:03,663 --> 00:38:04,789
Oh.

727
00:38:04,831 --> 00:38:07,800
No, that's the wrong way.

728
00:38:07,834 --> 00:38:08,823
Oh.

729
00:38:10,002 --> 00:38:11,799
No, that's the wrong way.

730
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:13,305
l want to go...

731
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,069
Oh...

732
00:38:16,108 --> 00:38:17,541
Oh, oh...

733
00:38:17,577 --> 00:38:19,477
Whoo! Oh. Oh, oh.

734
00:38:19,512 --> 00:38:20,672
Oh!

735
00:38:20,713 --> 00:38:21,805
Oh, oh...

736
00:38:21,848 --> 00:38:22,815
Oh...

737
00:38:22,915 --> 00:38:23,973
That way.

738
00:38:24,016 --> 00:38:24,983
That'll be 50 cents

739
00:38:25,017 --> 00:38:26,314
impersonating-a-traffic-cop tax.

740
00:38:26,352 --> 00:38:27,319
What?

741
00:38:27,353 --> 00:38:28,615
Oh.

742
00:38:28,654 --> 00:38:29,814
l'm sorry, Miss Oyl.

743
00:38:29,922 --> 00:38:32,117
Didn't recognize you
from the back.

744
00:38:32,158 --> 00:38:33,989
lt won't happen again.

745
00:38:34,026 --> 00:38:36,221
How come Miss Oyl
don't have to pay no taxes?

746
00:38:36,262 --> 00:38:38,594
That's ten cents question tax.

747
00:38:38,631 --> 00:38:41,725
But... l'll let you off
this time

748
00:38:41,767 --> 00:38:43,632
since you're with Miss Oyl.

749
00:38:43,669 --> 00:38:45,159
Good night, Miss Oyl.

750
00:38:45,204 --> 00:38:46,694
Well, how come being
with Miss Oyl

751
00:38:46,739 --> 00:38:49,003
means l don't have
to pay no...

752
00:38:49,041 --> 00:38:50,372
...taxes?

753
00:38:50,409 --> 00:38:54,038
Well, l don't know
what you're talking about.

754
00:38:57,483 --> 00:39:01,112
Here's a nice cup of tea
for you, Captain Bluto,

755
00:39:01,153 --> 00:39:02,484
while you're waiting.

756
00:39:07,827 --> 00:39:10,990
Where's Olive?

757
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,395
Olive?

758
00:39:12,431 --> 00:39:13,659
You think everyone pays taxes

759
00:39:13,699 --> 00:39:15,394
but me and my family,
don't you? Mm-hmm.

760
00:39:15,434 --> 00:39:16,799
Well, you couldn't be
more wrong.

761
00:39:16,869 --> 00:39:18,359
lf l'm wrong, why
am l in the right?

762
00:39:18,404 --> 00:39:20,235
You think it's because
l'm engaged to Bluto

763
00:39:20,273 --> 00:39:22,002
and Bluto runs the town
for the Commodore

764
00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:23,133
so we get special favors.

765
00:39:23,175 --> 00:39:24,233
Well, it's a lie. Hmm.

766
00:39:24,277 --> 00:39:25,835
Olive!

767
00:39:32,018 --> 00:39:33,383
Bluto is kind and generous

768
00:39:33,419 --> 00:39:35,614
and likes to do things
for his loved ones.

769
00:39:36,856 --> 00:39:38,483
And you want me to
hurt his feelings.

770
00:39:38,524 --> 00:39:39,786
Well, phooey on you.

771
00:39:41,193 --> 00:39:43,957
Hmm. You don't even care
enough about me or my family

772
00:39:43,996 --> 00:39:45,520
to be at my engagement party.

773
00:39:45,564 --> 00:39:48,397
And what are you doing here
in Sweethaven anyway, hmm?

774
00:39:48,434 --> 00:39:50,334
Well, l'm-l'm looking
for me pap.

775
00:39:50,369 --> 00:39:51,461
-Mmm.
-Yeah.

776
00:39:51,504 --> 00:39:54,598
Oh, well, if that's true,
then where is he?

777
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,801
Well, yeah, um, got me there.

778
00:39:56,842 --> 00:39:58,332
l don't really know.

779
00:39:58,377 --> 00:40:00,004
l... l got this sense

780
00:40:00,046 --> 00:40:01,775
that he's here though,
you know?

781
00:40:01,814 --> 00:40:03,839
Oh, well, all right,
l'll wait. Hmm.

782
00:40:03,883 --> 00:40:06,351
Anyway, there are too
many guests as it is.

783
00:40:06,385 --> 00:40:07,511
Half of them l hate.

784
00:40:25,738 --> 00:40:27,365
One thing l remember
about me pap

785
00:40:27,406 --> 00:40:29,874
was that he always used
to throw me up in the air.

786
00:40:29,976 --> 00:40:32,604
But he'd never be there
when l come down, you know.

787
00:40:32,645 --> 00:40:33,873
-Heh, heh, heh.
-Mmm.

788
00:40:33,913 --> 00:40:35,813
Boy, he had a sense ka humor,
didn't he?

789
00:40:35,848 --> 00:40:37,042
Yeah, that was me pap.

790
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:38,846
l remember that time
he gave me

791
00:40:38,884 --> 00:40:40,374
an electric eel as a toy.

792
00:40:40,419 --> 00:40:41,545
Eep!

793
00:40:41,587 --> 00:40:42,884
Yeah, that was fun.

794
00:40:42,922 --> 00:40:44,048
Or he'd rock me in my cradle

795
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:46,058
real, real, real hard
and l'd lose me formula.

796
00:40:46,092 --> 00:40:49,550
And then he'd say, ''One
day, you'll be a sailor.''

797
00:40:49,595 --> 00:40:52,291
That... that's what
l am today.

798
00:40:52,331 --> 00:40:55,198
Yeah. Sometimes,
he'd bounce me on his knee.

799
00:40:55,234 --> 00:40:57,065
Most of the time
he'd miss, though

800
00:40:57,103 --> 00:40:59,537
'cause he couldn't see
too well with one eye.

801
00:41:01,007 --> 00:41:02,338
Oh, me pap, yeah.

802
00:41:02,375 --> 00:41:04,673
Well, l'm not waiting
any longer. Hmm.

803
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:06,473
Oh, sorry, Miss Oyl.

804
00:41:07,713 --> 00:41:08,839
l was philoscofying.

805
00:41:08,881 --> 00:41:10,178
Mm-hmm.

806
00:41:10,216 --> 00:41:13,185
...between us, got kind of
derailed and...

807
00:41:13,219 --> 00:41:15,153
Oh, yeah, long time waiting.

808
00:41:15,187 --> 00:41:16,848
Wait a while..

809
00:41:16,889 --> 00:41:19,483
What are you doing
with that basket?

810
00:41:19,525 --> 00:41:21,220
Well, l-l'm carrying it.

811
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,194
lt's your basket, ain't it?

812
00:41:23,229 --> 00:41:24,355
lt is not my basket.

813
00:41:24,397 --> 00:41:26,865
Somebody has deliberately
painted that basket

814
00:41:26,966 --> 00:41:28,297
to look like my basket.

815
00:41:28,334 --> 00:41:30,165
My basket was clean
and beautiful

816
00:41:30,202 --> 00:41:31,601
and this basket is ugly.

817
00:41:31,637 --> 00:41:33,332
-Rattlesnake!
-Miss Oyl, we should at least

818
00:41:33,372 --> 00:41:34,703
have dinner first,
or something.

819
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,764
Rattlesnake!
Rattlesnake!

820
00:41:35,808 --> 00:41:37,207
Oh, rattlesnake!
Ooh! Oh, oh, oh!

821
00:41:37,243 --> 00:41:38,972
Rattlesnakes?
Where is it, Miss Oyl?

822
00:41:39,011 --> 00:41:39,568
Where is it?

823
00:41:39,612 --> 00:41:40,738
Oh, oh, rattlesnake, oh!

824
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:41,872
Don't worry, Miss Oyl,

825
00:41:41,914 --> 00:41:43,040
l've handled vermins before.

826
00:41:43,082 --> 00:41:45,016
l'll rattle that snakes
so it's a pair of shoes.

827
00:41:45,051 --> 00:41:46,040
Rattlesnake!
Rattlesnake!

828
00:41:46,085 --> 00:41:47,450
l'll rattle that...

829
00:41:47,486 --> 00:41:49,818
-l'll rattle him upside-down.

-You're bats.
-Oh, yeah?

l found him in Sweethaven.
That is why he's me Swee'pea.

-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm, yeah.

1034
00:49:40,752 --> 00:49:42,310
Well, Swee'pea is
about the worst name

l ever heard on a baby.

1036
00:49:43,455 --> 00:49:45,514
Well, what do you want me
to call him? Baby Oyl?

1037

What could happen to me?

1041
00:50:22,694 --> 00:50:24,787
Well, l could get killed.

1042
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:27,321
lt'd be worth getting killed
to help Mom and Pop.

1043
00:50:27,365 --> 00:50:29,265
What if l won?

1044
00:50:29,301 --> 00:50:30,563
l'm fast, l'm foxy.

1045
00:50:30,602 --> 00:50:33,093
He could have a heart attack.

1046
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:51,683
Sweet Sweethaven

1047

taking me to a fight

1050
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:01,896
and my parents to a fight

1051
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:03,195
and my baby to a fight.

1052
00:51:04,803 --> 00:51:08,432
Ah, Sweethaven...

1053

Oh, fights are not fun.

1055
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:20,415
Know the words
for this song, Cole?

1056
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:21,919
Of course l know the words.

1057
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:23,681
lt's our national anthem,
isn't it?

1058
00:51:23,722 --> 00:51:24,882
Pardon us...

1059
00:51:24,923 --> 00:51:26,720
Ah-ah-ah.
That'll be 62 cents--

1060
00:51:26,758 --> 00:51:29,056
going-to-an-illegal-
sporting-event tax.

1061
00:51:29,094 --> 00:51:31,528
lf it's illegal,
how come it's going on?

1062
00:51:33,732 --> 00:51:36,394
Ladies and gentlemen!

1063

Be careful...

1066

Ooh, watch that step.

1067
00:51:45,377 --> 00:51:46,639
Wait a minute.

1068
00:51:46,678 --> 00:51:48,646
They're having a lover's quarrel
in front of us.

1069
00:51:50,048 --> 00:51:52,642
That unworthiest
of worthies...

1070
00:51:52,684 --> 00:51:54,049

Now, look at that.

1074
00:52:00,825 --> 00:52:01,883
Wait a minute.

00:52:01,927 --> 00:52:05,192
Yeah... right there,

1076
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:06,197
Castor!

1077
00:52:06,231 --> 00:52:07,323
Oh, my son! Castor!

1078
00:52:07,365 --> 00:52:09,230
Make a man outta yourself.

1079
00:52:09,267 --> 00:52:10,996
Mom, Pop, l'm gonna fight him.

1080
00:52:11,036 --> 00:52:12,003
Whoops.

1081
00:52:12,037 --> 00:52:13,231
Don't go!

1082
00:52:13,271 --> 00:52:14,295
Oh, it's my baby.

1083
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:16,398
Get out--
Get my baby outta there!

1084
00:52:16,441 --> 00:52:17,738
Don't touch his feet!

1085
00:52:17,776 --> 00:52:19,801
He's gotta dance
with those feet.

1086
00:52:24,049 --> 00:52:26,313
Castor, we go home now.

1087
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:27,648
Olive,
do something about this.

1088
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:28,653
What are you, a nut?

1089
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:29,745
What good are you, Olive?

1090
00:52:29,788 --> 00:52:31,756
You get in there and get your
brother out of this!

1091
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:33,087
l can't stand
much more of this.

1092
00:52:33,124 --> 00:52:34,921
Where are my pills?

1093
00:52:34,993 --> 00:52:36,017
Don't do this!

1094
00:52:36,061 --> 00:52:37,926
Mr. Geezil,
get him outta there, Geezil!

1095
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:39,860
Gentlemen, you know the rules:

1096
00:52:39,898 --> 00:52:41,024
There are no rules.

1097
00:52:41,066 --> 00:52:42,966
This is a fight to the finish.

1098
00:52:45,103 --> 00:52:46,661
First man who is dead, loses.

1099
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:48,070
Good luck to both of you.

1100
00:52:48,106 --> 00:52:49,573
Did you see what he was doing?!

1101
00:52:49,608 --> 00:52:51,235
-You didn't see?!
-Good luck to you.

1102
00:52:51,276 --> 00:52:52,243
l hate you to pieces!

1103
00:52:52,277 --> 00:52:53,539
All right, come over here.

1104
00:52:53,578 --> 00:52:55,443
Now don't, don't kill him.

1105
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,175
Just fluff him up a bit.

1106
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:03,987
You'll be leading
with the left hand.

1107
00:53:04,022 --> 00:53:07,014
Castor! Castor,
get outta there!

1108
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,487
Go for him, right away, son.

1109
00:53:10,528 --> 00:53:11,961
Come on, Castor.

1110

1112
00:53:27,879 --> 00:53:29,608
Come on, hit him,

1113
00:53:29,648 --> 00:53:30,910
Hang him!

1114
00:53:30,949 --> 00:53:32,246
Come on, Castor.

1115
00:53:32,283 --> 00:53:33,773
Come on, knock him.

1116
00:53:35,487 --> 00:53:36,852
Oh!

Your name's Castor,

1120
00:53:44,996 --> 00:53:46,429
Come on, sting that whale!

1121
00:53:46,464 --> 00:53:48,261
Don't make him mad, Castor.

1122
00:53:50,468 --> 00:53:51,628
He's not a person!

1123

00:53:56,474 --> 00:53:58,408
Kick him!

1126
00:53:59,878 --> 00:54:01,209

00:54:09,988 --> 00:54:11,182

Oh, you'll be murdered.

1145
00:54:59,437 --> 00:55:02,497
All right, gentlemen,

00:55:04,209 --> 00:55:06,609
Touch gloves
and come out fighting.

1148
00:55:06,644 --> 00:55:07,611
What are you afraid of?

1149

1159
00:55:26,564 --> 00:55:28,498

1160
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:30,364
Give him a karate chop!

1161
00:55:41,579 --> 00:55:42,910
Very good.

1162
00:55:42,981 --> 00:55:44,915
Fist... that's fighting.

1163
00:55:44,983 --> 00:55:46,177
You can take him!

1164
00:55:53,925 --> 00:55:55,222
Don't you dare!

1165
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:56,591
-Hey, your mudder's here?

1169
00:56:02,333 --> 00:56:03,322
You see?

1170
00:56:03,368 --> 00:56:05,666
You're letting his
mother's be distracting you.

1171
00:56:05,703 --> 00:56:06,863
Not be doing that.

He's got my eyes.
He's got your mouth.

lt's a soup burger.

1239
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:58,155
These are difficult times.

1240
01:00:58,195 --> 01:00:59,423
Burgers can't be choosers.

1241
01:00:59,463 --> 01:01:00,589
Phooey.

1242

Work is what is making
the heart grow stronger. Come.

1243
01:01:03,768 --> 01:01:05,030
Open wide.

Bye, Mom.

01:01:06,103 --> 01:01:07,798
Ow!

1246
01:01:07,838 --> 01:01:09,533
Worry, worry, worry.

1247
01:01:11,375 --> 01:01:12,501
Now... there!

1248
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:14,602
Well, hope the taxes
don't come to too much.

1249
01:01:14,645 --> 01:01:18,342
Oh, the main thing is
that you're all right.

1250
01:01:18,382 --> 01:01:20,680
Yeah.

1251
01:01:20,718 --> 01:01:21,912
Well, were you worried

1252
01:01:21,986 --> 01:01:25,217
that l might have gotten killed
or something, maybe, yeah?

1253
01:01:25,256 --> 01:01:26,416
Oh, Popeye, don't be silly.

1254
01:01:26,457 --> 01:01:27,788
l knew.

1255
01:01:27,825 --> 01:01:30,419
Oh, you... you didn't
have no confidenkce.

1256
01:01:30,461 --> 01:01:31,587
Oh, l did, too.

1257
01:01:31,629 --> 01:01:32,687
Mm-hmm, yeah.

1258
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:33,788
l did, too.

1259
01:01:33,831 --> 01:01:34,923
After l asked Swee'pea.

1260
01:01:34,965 --> 01:01:36,091
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1261
01:01:36,133 --> 01:01:37,259
That's rich.

1262
01:01:37,301 --> 01:01:39,531
Oh, you're gone now.
You're really a dizzy dame.

1263
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:40,798
Oh, l asked Swee'pea,

1264
01:01:40,838 --> 01:01:41,930
and he told me.

1265
01:01:42,039 --> 01:01:43,301
lsn't that so?

1266
01:01:48,446 --> 01:01:50,380
What's this here?

1267
01:01:50,414 --> 01:01:52,439
See, l asked Swee'pea,

1268
01:01:52,483 --> 01:01:55,350
''Swee'pea,
will Popeye be killed?''

1269
01:01:55,386 --> 01:01:56,853
-Uh-uh.
-No?

1270
01:01:56,887 --> 01:02:00,186
So then l asked,

1271
01:02:00,224 --> 01:02:03,523
''Swee'pea, will Popeye
be seriously maimed?''

1272
01:02:05,229 --> 01:02:06,457
No?

1273
01:02:07,998 --> 01:02:08,896
That's two for two.

1274
01:02:08,999 --> 01:02:10,796
That could happen
to anybody, ya know.

1275
01:02:10,835 --> 01:02:14,635
So then l queried, ''Swee'pea,

1276
01:02:14,672 --> 01:02:16,867
will Popeye actually survive?''

1277
01:02:18,776 --> 01:02:20,505
Yeah, l survived.
Yeah, yeah.

1278
01:02:20,544 --> 01:02:22,136
''What? You mean he'll win?''

1279
01:02:23,347 --> 01:02:24,575
Oh!

1280
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:26,207
That's-that's a neat trick.

1281
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:29,777
Oh-ho, me infant
is a psychic of profiks.

1282
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:31,617
lf l didn't see it
with me own eye,

1283
01:02:31,655 --> 01:02:32,883
l wouldn't believe it.

1284
01:02:32,923 --> 01:02:34,914
That kid's a regular forecaster.

1285
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:37,792
Remind me to ask him
about gold futures.

1286
01:02:37,828 --> 01:02:41,320
More interested in talking to
him about immediate futures.

1287
01:02:41,365 --> 01:02:42,332
Uh, Popeye?

1288
01:02:42,366 --> 01:02:43,492
Yeah?

1289
01:02:43,534 --> 01:02:45,024
He's an adorable
little fellow.

1290
01:02:45,069 --> 01:02:46,934
And he's a psychic, too.
Ain't that the truth.

1291
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:48,666
But he looks
a little peaked to me.

1292
01:02:48,706 --> 01:02:51,174
He needs some air.

1293
01:02:51,208 --> 01:02:54,302
Air? That's all
we have here is air.

1294
01:02:54,345 --> 01:02:55,937
With your permission, Popeye,

1295
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,607
l'll... take him
for a little walk.

1296
01:02:57,648 --> 01:02:58,615
Well, Wimpy, why not?

1297
01:02:58,649 --> 01:03:00,048
l mean, you're like his uncle.

1298
01:03:00,084 --> 01:03:01,210
You're his Uncle Wimp.

1299
01:03:02,286 --> 01:03:03,583
Yeah, that's it.

1300
01:03:03,621 --> 01:03:04,679
Come along.

1301
01:03:04,722 --> 01:03:06,053
Hey, don't forget
his little hat here.

1302
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:07,057
Don't forget his hat.

1303
01:03:07,091 --> 01:03:08,058
He's going out in uniform.

1304
01:03:08,092 --> 01:03:09,059
Oh, of course.

1305
01:03:09,093 --> 01:03:10,060
There you go.

1306
01:03:10,094 --> 01:03:11,061
Thank you.

1307
01:03:11,095 --> 01:03:12,084
Ain't that something?

1308
01:03:12,129 --> 01:03:13,153
He's taking him for a walk.

1309
01:03:13,197 --> 01:03:14,186
Hey!

1310
01:03:14,231 --> 01:03:15,357
Hey, wait a minute there.

1311
01:03:15,399 --> 01:03:16,730
You trying to pull a fask one?

1312
01:03:16,767 --> 01:03:17,734
He can't walks yet.

1313
01:03:17,768 --> 01:03:19,030
Oh, l'll carry him.

1314
01:03:19,069 --> 01:03:20,866
Oh, in that case,
it's all right then.

1315
01:03:20,905 --> 01:03:23,237
As long as you take him
for a drags or something.

1316
01:03:23,274 --> 01:03:24,901
Hey, l want to carry him
for a walk.

1317
01:03:24,942 --> 01:03:26,136
Oh, leave him be there, Olive.

1318
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:28,702
lt's Uncle Wimps
going with the Swee'pea.

1319
01:03:28,746 --> 01:03:31,180
Oh, yeah, Wimpy can take
him but l can't? Hmm.

1320
01:03:31,215 --> 01:03:32,648
Well, um...

1321
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:34,651
wh-who says you can't?

1322
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:36,414
You said l can't. Hmm.

1323
01:03:36,453 --> 01:03:38,921
Oh. Well, um...

1324
01:03:38,989 --> 01:03:40,718
that was before.

1325
01:03:40,758 --> 01:03:42,749
Before what?

1326
01:03:42,793 --> 01:03:45,421
Well, um...

1327
01:03:45,462 --> 01:03:50,593
before l... l knew
you was worried about me.

1328
01:03:50,634 --> 01:03:52,534
Oh!

1329
01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:53,594
Oh.

1330
01:03:53,637 --> 01:03:55,867
You mean, now l can carry him

1331
01:03:55,906 --> 01:03:58,306
just because
l was worried about you?

1332
01:03:58,342 --> 01:03:59,866
Yes. Yes, mm-hmm.

1333
01:03:59,910 --> 01:04:02,344
Phooey.

1334
01:04:02,379 --> 01:04:03,539
Phooey?

1335
01:04:03,581 --> 01:04:04,980
Mm.

1336
01:04:05,015 --> 01:04:06,505
Y-You said ''phooey'' to me?

1337
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:09,417
l said ''phooey''
and l mean ''phooey.''

1338
01:04:09,453 --> 01:04:10,681
Phooey.

1339
01:04:14,825 --> 01:04:16,452
She said ''phooey'' to me.

1340
01:04:16,493 --> 01:04:18,222
She said...

1341
01:04:18,262 --> 01:04:20,526
''phooey'' to me.

1342
01:04:27,938 --> 01:04:29,906
We have Lickety Split,
number one.

1343
01:04:29,974 --> 01:04:32,204
Number three, Sandcrab.

1344
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:33,335
How 'bout six?

1345
01:04:34,445 --> 01:04:35,503
Everything's going
to be all right.

1346
01:04:35,546 --> 01:04:36,604
Now, he's with
his Uncle Wimps,

1347
01:04:36,647 --> 01:04:38,239
and they've only been gone
for a couple of hours.

1348
01:04:38,282 --> 01:04:39,249
Yeah, couple of hours.

1349
01:04:39,283 --> 01:04:40,580
Ooh, wait a minute.

1350
01:04:40,618 --> 01:04:42,108
This town could have been
built in a couple of hours.

1351
01:04:42,152 --> 01:04:43,278
Whoo!

1352
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:45,254
Oh, got to be trustworthy.
Wimps is trustworthy.

1353
01:04:45,289 --> 01:04:47,587
Wait a minute, l don't trust him
as far as l can throw him.

1354
01:04:47,625 --> 01:04:48,922
Throw him?
l can't even lift him.

1355
01:04:48,959 --> 01:04:50,119
l don't see them anywhere.

1356
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,492
Well, maybe they went
to the Rough House.

1357
01:04:52,529 --> 01:04:54,292
No, Wimpy's barred
from the Rough House.

1358
01:04:54,331 --> 01:04:55,298
-Bad credit.
-Right.

1359
01:04:55,332 --> 01:04:57,892
Oh, my stars and horses!

1360
01:04:57,935 --> 01:04:59,732
Derby day?

1361
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:01,465
That rat Wimpy.

1362
01:05:01,505 --> 01:05:02,972
What's this got to do
with me Swee'pea?

1363
01:05:03,007 --> 01:05:04,372
They've gone to the races.

1364
01:05:04,408 --> 01:05:06,137
A baby at the horse races.

1365
01:05:06,176 --> 01:05:07,609
Where is these races?

1366
01:05:07,645 --> 01:05:09,272
Come on. Let's go.

1367
01:05:15,686 --> 01:05:18,712
Come on! Come on!

1368
01:05:27,164 --> 01:05:29,189
Oh!

1369
01:05:41,011 --> 01:05:42,376
And the winner is...

1370
01:05:42,413 --> 01:05:44,381
Cat's Pajamas.

1371
01:05:44,415 --> 01:05:45,541
Yippee!

1372
01:05:45,582 --> 01:05:47,379
We've done it.

1373
01:05:47,418 --> 01:05:48,908
Oh, that Wimps.

1374
01:05:48,986 --> 01:05:51,045
Abducticating me Swee'pea there.

1375
01:05:51,088 --> 01:05:53,113
Oh, a race track
ain't no nurskery.

1376
01:05:53,157 --> 01:05:55,387
Oh, patience, patience.

1377
01:05:55,426 --> 01:05:56,393
Got to remain calm.

1378
01:05:56,427 --> 01:05:57,758
That's it.

1379
01:05:57,795 --> 01:05:58,921
Straight ahead.

1380
01:06:02,433 --> 01:06:03,900
Lonesome, chubby?

1381
01:06:10,407 --> 01:06:11,567
We've got it. Look.

1382
01:06:11,608 --> 01:06:13,405
The Wax Doors and Gardeners?

1383
01:06:13,444 --> 01:06:15,969
No. Number two, Ed.

1384
01:06:16,013 --> 01:06:17,002
Ed?

1385
01:06:17,047 --> 01:06:18,412
That's a horse.

1386
01:06:18,449 --> 01:06:21,441
All right...
number six, Holy Moly.

1387
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,251
You like Holy Moly?

1388
01:06:24,288 --> 01:06:25,414
Holy Moly?

1389
01:06:25,456 --> 01:06:27,151
Holy Moly.

1390
01:06:27,191 --> 01:06:28,556
That's it, Holy Moly.

1391
01:06:28,592 --> 01:06:29,786
We can't lose.

1392
01:06:29,827 --> 01:06:31,852
Everything on Holy Moly.

1393
01:06:43,474 --> 01:06:44,600

Oh, what is this?

1401
01:07:05,896 --> 01:07:07,193
A house of ill repukes?

1402
01:07:07,231 --> 01:07:11,861
Ooh, who'd bring me infant
to this den of immoraliky?

1403
01:07:11,935 --> 01:07:14,028
Don't touch nothin'. You might
get a venerable disease.

1404
01:07:14,071 --> 01:07:15,470
Oh. Ooh. Ooh!

1405
01:07:15,506 --> 01:07:17,531
ls that a bed pole you got
in your pocket, handsome?

1406
01:07:17,574 --> 01:07:19,769
Hello. Better grab me loins up
for this one.

1407
01:07:19,810 --> 01:07:21,243
Read your paper, Cole.

1408
01:07:23,614 --> 01:07:25,377
Will you...?

1409
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:28,078
You know, if Mom caught me
in here she'd kill me.

1410
01:07:28,118 --> 01:07:29,881
There's Mom.

1411
01:07:29,987 --> 01:07:31,511
Where is that Wimpy?

1412
01:07:33,924 --> 01:07:35,118
Oh!

-There he is.

1418
01:07:47,271 --> 01:07:48,238
Wimpy, l'm disgustapated.

1419
01:07:48,272 --> 01:07:49,899
May l borrow the infant
for just a moment here?

1420
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:51,100
Oh, well, yes,
for just a moment.

1421
01:07:51,141 --> 01:07:52,438
l don't want
your little sweet peepers

1422
01:07:52,476 --> 01:07:53,568
to see what's about to happen.

1423
01:07:53,610 --> 01:07:55,077
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

1424
01:07:55,112 --> 01:07:57,376

1425
01:07:57,414 --> 01:07:59,211
Yeah, what is this?

You won 120 simoleons?

1428
01:08:02,886 --> 01:08:04,410
You know how many hamburgers
that is?

1429
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:05,717
Put your eye
where your ear is.

1430
01:08:05,756 --> 01:08:06,848
Disgraceful.
How many races?

1431
01:08:06,957 --> 01:08:08,117
Two races.

1432
01:08:08,158 --> 01:08:10,092
Hmm, let me see
that racing form.

1433
01:08:10,127 --> 01:08:12,027
Oh, maybe we can...

01:08:12,062 --> 01:08:13,757
Oh, Swee'pea?
We, oh... oh, now...

1435
01:08:13,797 --> 01:08:15,128
Wait, no.
No child of mine

1436
01:08:15,165 --> 01:08:16,462

a raceking kout.

1437
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:17,467

What are you doing there?

1441
01:08:25,242 --> 01:08:26,709
No childs of mine
will be exploiticated

1442
01:08:26,743 --> 01:08:27,710

Yeah, that's true.

1444
01:08:28,745 --> 01:08:30,178
You're going to be
a president one day.

1445
01:08:30,214 --> 01:08:31,772
lt is not ill-gotten,
it's good-gotten gains.

1446

These gains with cloth us
and feed us and save us.

1447
01:08:33,584 --> 01:08:35,381
Wrong is wrong even
when it helps you.

1448
01:08:35,419 --> 01:08:36,511
The horses are at the gate.

1449
01:08:36,553 --> 01:08:39,989
Oh, family is more important
than dumb morality, hmm.

1450
01:08:40,023 --> 01:08:42,150
Oh, look, he's got

01:09:01,578 --> 01:09:03,136

Maybe not, but l knows
what law suitks me.

01:09:48,725 --> 01:09:51,250
Top to me bottoms
from the bottoms to me top

1481
01:09:51,295 --> 01:09:53,889
That's the way it is
till the day that l drop

1482
01:09:53,931 --> 01:09:56,399
What am l?

1483
01:09:56,433 --> 01:09:58,628
l yam what l yam

1484
01:10:00,270 --> 01:10:02,170
l yam what l yam

1485
01:10:02,205 --> 01:10:03,900
Here he comes.
Come on, Sucking Lemon.

1486
01:10:03,941 --> 01:10:04,908
What l yam, what l yam

1487
01:10:04,942 --> 01:10:06,204
Oh, come on, get up there. Ooh!

1488
01:10:06,243 --> 01:10:07,369
Wondered about meself.

1489
01:10:07,411 --> 01:10:09,436
To be or not to be--
who's axskin'?

1490
01:10:09,479 --> 01:10:12,573
l can open up an ockean,
l can take a lot of sail

1491
01:10:12,616 --> 01:10:16,017
l can lose a lot of waters,
and l'll never have to bail

1492
01:10:16,053 --> 01:10:18,283
On the coast of Madagascar,
grab a whale by the tail

1493
01:10:18,322 --> 01:10:19,289
Boy, let's go get it.

1494
01:10:19,323 --> 01:10:20,585
What am l?

1495
01:10:20,624 --> 01:10:22,751
What am l?

1496
01:10:22,793 --> 01:10:24,090
l yam what l yam!

1497
01:10:24,127 --> 01:10:26,925
l'm Popeye, the sailor

1498
01:10:27,030 --> 01:10:29,760
l'm Popeye, the sailor

1499
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,268
l'm Popeye, the sailor

1500
01:10:32,302 --> 01:10:34,930
l yam what l yam,
and that's all that l yam

1501
01:10:34,972 --> 01:10:37,770
l yam what l yam
what l yam what l yam

1502
01:10:37,808 --> 01:10:40,242
l'm Popeye, the sailor man.

1503
01:10:40,277 --> 01:10:41,608
Ha-ha!

1504
01:10:41,645 --> 01:10:44,910
Whoo, hoo-hoo!

1505
01:10:47,985 --> 01:10:50,419
Arms, don't fail me now.

1506
01:11:01,832 --> 01:11:05,097
l am what l am
and that's all that l am

1507
01:11:05,135 --> 01:11:07,831
l'm Popeye, the sailor man.

1508
01:11:09,106 --> 01:11:13,600
Whoo, hoo-hoo!

1509
01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:35,894
Whoo, hoo-hoo!

1510
01:11:40,032 --> 01:11:41,693
Oh, l hate to do this,
Swee'pea,

1511
01:11:41,733 --> 01:11:43,530
but it's neskessary.

1512
01:11:43,569 --> 01:11:45,764
Sometimes you got to do things
you don't want to do

1513
01:11:45,804 --> 01:11:47,135
when you got to do 'em, but...

1514
01:11:47,172 --> 01:11:48,298
Oh, it's cruel, Mr. Eye...

1515
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:50,308
lt may not make sense now
but maybe later.

1516
01:11:50,342 --> 01:11:51,969
...uh, Mr. Pop...
um, Mr. Popeye.

1517
01:11:52,010 --> 01:11:53,500
l'm sorry, Mrs. Oyl,

1518
01:11:53,545 --> 01:11:56,480
but it's parenk's duty
to protect me adopticated son

1519
01:11:56,515 --> 01:11:57,482
from child abusk.

1520
01:11:57,516 --> 01:11:58,983
Oh, oh, but think of Olive.

1521
01:11:59,017 --> 01:12:02,783
You can't take the poor baby
away from poor Olive.

1522
01:12:02,821 --> 01:12:04,118
Me moraliky ain't bilge,
Mrs. Oyl.

1523
01:12:04,156 --> 01:12:05,817
Me mind is set,
and when me mind is set,

1524
01:12:05,857 --> 01:12:07,688
l don't think from nothin'.

1525
01:12:07,726 --> 01:12:08,715
You sure about that?

1526
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:09,886
Yeah, l think so, yes.

1527
01:12:12,464 --> 01:12:14,091
Maybe we owe him an apology.

1528
01:12:14,132 --> 01:12:16,794
We'll find another place
to plant ourselves. Yeah.

1529
01:12:17,970 --> 01:12:19,164
Me, l'll check you, okay?

1530
01:12:19,204 --> 01:12:21,536
Yeah, you all right there?
This ain't bad, is it?

1531
01:12:21,573 --> 01:12:23,438
lt ain't the Ritz,
but at least you get

1532
01:12:23,475 --> 01:12:25,067
a little womb service here, huh?

1533
01:12:26,545 --> 01:12:28,240
lt ain't no palatkial
mansion either,

1534
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:29,269
but we got something.

1535
01:12:29,314 --> 01:12:31,282
Best l ever saw.

1536
01:12:31,316 --> 01:12:32,613
lt's got your blankets here.

1537
01:12:32,651 --> 01:12:33,777
Yeah, there we goes.

1538
01:12:33,819 --> 01:12:34,786
Got your blankets.

1539
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:35,844
Here we go.

1540
01:12:35,887 --> 01:12:37,582
You moved out of the Oyl's?

1541
01:12:37,623 --> 01:12:39,113
None of your business.

1542
01:12:39,157 --> 01:12:40,590
$4.25, moving out tax.

1543
01:12:40,626 --> 01:12:43,459
Nuts to you,
and nuts to your taxes.

1544
01:12:43,495 --> 01:12:44,621
You moved in here?

1545
01:12:44,663 --> 01:12:45,789
What's it look like?

1546
01:12:45,831 --> 01:12:46,957
$5.25, moving-in tax.

1547
01:12:47,032 --> 01:12:48,624
Oh, don't forget double nuts.

1548
01:12:48,667 --> 01:12:50,157
And where's this baby
come from?

1549
01:12:50,202 --> 01:12:51,669
Oh, this pelican's
brought him.

1550
01:12:51,703 --> 01:12:54,763
89 cents--
unlicensed baby tax.

1551
01:12:54,806 --> 01:12:56,865
Oh, get out of here!

1552
01:12:56,908 --> 01:12:57,875
Don't take me personal.

1553
01:12:57,909 --> 01:12:58,739
Hey, oh-oh, oh, no!

1554
01:13:11,323 --> 01:13:16,522
Hoop... hoop... hoopla!

1555
01:13:16,561 --> 01:13:17,926
Did ya see that,
what he did?

1556
01:13:17,963 --> 01:13:19,726
A whole lot of peoples.

1557
01:13:26,638 --> 01:13:28,401
Oh, thank you.

1558
01:13:35,981 --> 01:13:37,573
Go tax the fishes!

1559
01:14:12,284 --> 01:14:15,583
Swee'pea? Swee'pea? Swee'pea?

1560
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:18,589
Where's Swee'pea?

1561
01:14:18,623 --> 01:14:20,454
Swee'pea!

1562
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:25,593
Where's Swee'pea?!

1563
01:14:25,630 --> 01:14:27,689
Swee'pea!

1564
01:14:27,733 --> 01:14:32,227
Swee'pea!

1565
01:15:02,934 --> 01:15:07,564
lt's me own fault
Swee'pea's been kidnapped.

1566
01:15:07,606 --> 01:15:09,540
Olives was right.

1567
01:15:09,574 --> 01:15:14,739
Even an orphan needs
a mudder and a fadder.

1568
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:16,304
Oh..

1569
01:15:16,348 --> 01:15:18,316
lf l was going to
be Swee'pea's mudder,

1570
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:20,750
l should have at least
let her be his fadder.

1571
01:15:20,786 --> 01:15:23,414
Ovisk ovisk.

1572
01:15:23,455 --> 01:15:24,615
Oh...

1573
01:15:24,656 --> 01:15:28,422
l ain't man enough
to be a mudder.

1574
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:32,260
And all at once l knew,
l knew at once

1575
01:15:32,297 --> 01:15:35,789
l knew he needed me

1576
01:15:39,971 --> 01:15:46,638
Until the day l die, l won't
know why l knew he needed me

1577
01:15:51,149 --> 01:15:53,242
lt could be fantasy

1578
01:15:53,285 --> 01:15:57,449
Oh-oh

1579
01:15:57,489 --> 01:16:01,255
Or maybe it's because

1580
01:16:01,293 --> 01:16:06,060
He needs me, he needs me,
he needs me, he needs me

1581
01:16:06,097 --> 01:16:09,430
He needs me, he needs me

1582
01:16:14,105 --> 01:16:21,204
Da-da, da, da, da, da,
da-da, da-da, da

1583
01:16:22,647 --> 01:16:25,582
lt's like a dime a dance,
l'll take a chance

1584
01:16:25,617 --> 01:16:29,280
l will because he needs me

1585
01:16:34,125 --> 01:16:37,253
No one ever asked before,
before

1586
01:16:37,295 --> 01:16:40,196
Because
they never needed me...

1587
01:16:40,232 --> 01:16:42,826
But l do.

1588
01:16:42,868 --> 01:16:45,598
But he does!

1589
01:16:45,637 --> 01:16:50,768
Maybe it's because
he's so alone

1590
01:16:50,809 --> 01:16:56,611
Maybe it's because
he's never had a home

1591
01:16:56,648 --> 01:17:00,311
He needs me, he needs me,
he needs me, he needs me

1592
01:17:00,352 --> 01:17:04,083
He needs me, he needs me

1593
01:17:07,092 --> 01:17:09,720
For once, for once in life

1594
01:17:09,761 --> 01:17:14,061
l finally felt
that someone needed me

1595
01:17:19,271 --> 01:17:24,573
And if it turns out real

1596
01:17:24,609 --> 01:17:29,239
Then love can turn the wheel

1597
01:17:29,281 --> 01:17:31,749
Because he needs me,
he needs me

1598
01:17:31,783 --> 01:17:36,982
He needs me, he needs me,
he needs me, he needs me

1599
01:17:42,494 --> 01:17:47,932
Da-da, da, da, da, da,
da-da, da-da, dum

1600
01:17:47,966 --> 01:17:55,463
Da-da, da, da, da, da,
da-da, da-da, da.

1601
01:18:40,118 --> 01:18:42,609
Bye-bye.

1602
01:18:46,324 --> 01:18:48,918
Dear...

1603
01:18:48,994 --> 01:18:51,053
Swee'peas.

1604
01:18:51,096 --> 01:18:54,588
Everybody's gotta have
somebodys

1605
01:18:54,633 --> 01:18:57,431
Even if it's only mes

1606
01:18:57,469 --> 01:19:00,199
Stops yer cryin', Swee'peas

1607
01:19:00,238 --> 01:19:03,036
And try to go to sleeps

1608
01:19:03,074 --> 01:19:06,532

1609
01:19:06,578 --> 01:19:09,547
l don't knows if you cares

1610
01:19:09,581 --> 01:19:12,379
You could've come
from Heavens

1611
01:19:12,417 --> 01:19:15,386
Or a typhoon anywhere

1612
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:21,723
Well, me, l came from Heaven
of Cuddly Na-La Lagoon

1613
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:27,892
And l was told me mammy
gave me up in a typhoon

1614
01:19:27,932 --> 01:19:30,765
Well, don't you cry,
little Swee'pea

1615
01:19:30,802 --> 01:19:34,238
You and me,
we's both the same

1616
01:19:34,272 --> 01:19:36,900
And the biggest tear
l ever seen

1617
01:19:36,941 --> 01:19:40,399
Came in the eye
of a hurricane

1618
01:19:40,445 --> 01:19:46,111
Go to sleep, sleep, sleepy,
now tell me what you sees

1619
01:19:46,151 --> 01:19:52,954
And someday when you's older
l'll tell you's all about me.

1620
01:19:54,059 --> 01:19:55,924
''Love...

1621
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:58,952
From Popeye.''

1622
01:20:00,632 --> 01:20:02,395
Oh, oh...

1623
01:21:07,966 --> 01:21:10,730
Let me see, now...

1624
01:21:10,769 --> 01:21:12,737
''Keep out.''

1625
01:21:12,771 --> 01:21:15,604
Hmm... ''Tax shelter.''

1626
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:17,938
Uh...

1627
01:21:18,042 --> 01:21:19,509
Oh, the Commodore's boat,

1628
01:21:19,544 --> 01:21:21,569
but no Commodore, of course.

1629
01:21:33,921 --> 01:21:37,652
Aha!

1630
01:21:37,692 --> 01:21:38,716
Swee'pea's still
in Sweethaven.

1631
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:39,727
Wimpy!

1632
01:21:39,761 --> 01:21:41,729
-Who are you talking to?
-Uh, uh...

1633
01:21:41,763 --> 01:21:42,991
What did you say about Swee'pea?

1634
01:21:43,097 --> 01:21:44,257
l said nothing!

1635
01:21:44,298 --> 01:21:45,458
Oh!

There's no one home. Let's go.

Kid?

He ain't no Commodores.

1777

A hoity-toity Commodore.

1778
01:26:41,429 --> 01:26:42,555
He would never be that.

1779
01:26:42,596 --> 01:26:43,790
-Oh, a rat.
-Oh.

1780
01:26:43,831 --> 01:26:44,957
-A crook.
-Oh.

1781
01:26:44,999 --> 01:26:46,227
A kidnapper, and a Commodore.

1782

of some dizzy gaming broad.

01:26:56,010 --> 01:26:56,977
-That's where they ain't?
-Mm-hmm.

1788
01:26:57,011 --> 01:26:58,137
Well, if that's

1789
01:26:58,179 --> 01:26:59,669
that's where l'm going
to prove that they ain't.

1790
01:26:59,714 --> 01:27:00,681
Oh, come on.
Let's do this.

1791
01:27:00,715 --> 01:27:01,704

01:27:14,628 --> 01:27:16,391
but l've a shave
and shampoo awaiting.

1797
01:27:16,430 --> 01:27:17,590
Give 'em hell, Popeye!

1798
01:27:17,631 --> 01:27:18,598
Kick 'em in the butt.

1799
01:27:18,632 --> 01:27:19,929
You can count on me,
Mr. Popeye,

1800
01:27:20,034 --> 01:27:20,932
uh, tomorrow.

1801
01:27:21,035 --> 01:27:22,935
See l'd go with you,
but l got to lock up.

1802
01:27:23,037 --> 01:27:24,834
l just hope

1803
01:27:24,872 --> 01:27:26,737
l'd go with you, Popeye,
but l got us a cold.

1804
01:27:26,774 --> 01:27:28,036
You know l'd go with you...

1805
01:27:28,075 --> 01:27:29,372

1806
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:30,536

01:27:30,578 --> 01:27:32,170
He's coming.
Revolution is waiting.

1808
01:27:32,213 --> 01:27:33,373
Oh, are you going?

1809
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:34,506
Heard it's impartial.

Are you going?

-Not me.

of the water, l'd go.

1813
01:27:45,626 --> 01:27:46,820
Make 'em dance, Popeye.

1814
01:27:46,861 --> 01:27:48,726
Almost brought you
a bottle of Pepsi.

1815
01:27:48,763 --> 01:27:49,889
Clean up on 'em, Popeye.

1816
01:27:49,930 --> 01:27:51,761
Nauseating.

1817
01:27:51,799 --> 01:27:53,767
Don't worry,

1818
01:27:53,801 --> 01:27:54,768

You're casking shadows

1854
01:29:52,119 --> 01:29:53,484
Pride of the Pacifiric.

01:29:53,521 --> 01:29:54,954
And father to the shark.

1856
01:29:55,022 --> 01:29:56,512
Brother to the piranhaca.

1857
01:29:56,557 --> 01:29:58,422
Cousin to the killer whale.

1858

01:30:07,735 --> 01:30:09,828
No resemblance.

We-we got the same
squinky eye.

1863

What squinky eye?

That's going to be hard
for you to see. Oh.

1865

We got the same pipe, Pap.

1866
01:30:22,316 --> 01:30:24,910
You idiot,

1867
01:30:24,952 --> 01:30:27,386

Oh.

1872

Oh, yes.

1873

There's one way to prove

1874
01:30:41,936 --> 01:30:44,837
Pick up that can of spinach.

1875
01:30:44,872 --> 01:30:45,998
Pick it up!

1876

01:30:51,145 --> 01:30:52,339
Yeah. Yeah.

Eat it?

1881
01:30:54,815 --> 01:30:55,941
Eat it.

1882
01:30:55,983 --> 01:30:57,109
Raw?

1883
01:30:57,151 --> 01:30:59,415
Eat it raw.

1884
01:31:00,421 --> 01:31:01,388

that spinach.

1888
01:31:04,491 --> 01:31:05,617
Oh!

1889
01:31:05,659 --> 01:31:06,956
l don't want to eat
that spinach.

1890
01:31:07,027 --> 01:31:07,959

1891
01:31:07,995 --> 01:31:09,257
Eat that spinach!

1892
01:31:09,296 --> 01:31:13,960
Oh, you disobedient brat.

1893
01:31:14,034 --> 01:31:16,127
You was disobedient
when you was two,

1894
01:31:16,170 --> 01:31:18,070
and you're still
disobedient now!

1895
01:31:18,105 --> 01:31:19,800
You wouldn't eat your spinach.

1896
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:21,831
Spinach what kept
our family strong

1897
01:31:21,875 --> 01:31:23,206
for thousands of years.

1898
01:31:23,243 --> 01:31:25,677
And what does me only
oxspring do with it?

1899
01:31:25,713 --> 01:31:27,146
He spits it up.

1900
01:31:27,181 --> 01:31:28,205
His mother ups and dies,

1901
01:31:28,248 --> 01:31:29,681
and he wouldn't eat his spinach.

1902
01:31:29,717 --> 01:31:30,706
She choked on it, Pop.

1903
01:31:30,751 --> 01:31:31,718
His poppa out of work,

1904
01:31:31,752 --> 01:31:33,185
and he wouldn't eat his spinach.

1905
01:31:33,220 --> 01:31:34,312
lt wasn't my fault.

1906
01:31:34,355 --> 01:31:35,822
The whole country
in a depressigan.

1907
01:31:37,091 --> 01:31:38,820
And he wouldn't eat his spinach.

1908
01:31:38,859 --> 01:31:40,156
That was Coolidge, Poppa.

1909
01:31:40,194 --> 01:31:41,422
His poppa going hungry.

1910
01:31:41,462 --> 01:31:42,520
Going off to steal.

1911
01:31:42,563 --> 01:31:43,689
Stealing what?

1912
01:31:43,731 --> 01:31:45,164
Spinach.

1913
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:49,192
So his ungrate son
could grow up big and strong.

1914
01:31:49,236 --> 01:31:50,328
You know what l done?

1915
01:31:50,371 --> 01:31:52,839
You know what l done
when the G man catched me

1916
01:31:52,873 --> 01:31:53,999

01:31:56,610 --> 01:31:58,237
l laughed a whole year.

1920
01:32:01,882 --> 01:32:03,850
Cut me down
from this yardarm.

1921
01:32:03,884 --> 01:32:05,511
Getting away with that rotten
little insect

1922
01:32:05,552 --> 01:32:06,519
of a stool pigeon.

1923
01:32:06,553 --> 01:32:07,520
Cut you down?

1924
01:32:07,554 --> 01:32:08,543

Well, you said cut you down.

1931

lf you do,
l'll make you eat it.

1939
01:32:38,085 --> 01:32:40,679
You'll be known as

All hands on deck.

1959
01:33:21,462 --> 01:33:23,930
Help, Popeye!

1960
01:33:23,964 --> 01:33:26,296
The wharf, the wharf is moving.

1961
01:33:26,333 --> 01:33:27,732
Shut up, stupid.

1962
01:33:27,768 --> 01:33:28,894
This ain't no wharf.

1963
01:33:28,936 --> 01:33:30,335
This is me getaway boat.

1964
01:33:30,370 --> 01:33:31,701

01:33:44,985 --> 01:33:46,816
Hurry up, Popeye!

1967
01:33:46,854 --> 01:33:48,981
You're falling behind!

1968
01:33:49,089 --> 01:33:51,853
And Bluto's getting away!

1969
01:33:51,892 --> 01:33:53,291

1970
01:33:53,327 --> 01:33:57,093
Help!

1971
01:33:59,332 --> 01:34:01,926
What is it?

1972
01:34:01,968 --> 01:34:03,936
lt's a rock.

1973
01:34:03,970 --> 01:34:06,200
lt's a hard place.

1974
01:34:06,239 --> 01:34:08,673
Oh, no. lt's Scab lsland.

1975
01:34:08,708 --> 01:34:09,800

1976
01:34:09,843 --> 01:34:11,538
Don't worry, Castor.

1977
01:34:11,578 --> 01:34:13,671
Your father's with us.

1978

Haul ass, haul ass.

Get to your stations.

1982
01:34:21,288 --> 01:34:22,949
Get to your battle stations.

1983
01:34:22,989 --> 01:34:26,891
Oh... oh, phooey!

1984

What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1985
01:34:30,764 --> 01:34:32,823
Who do you think you are,
Captain Arab?

1986
01:34:32,866 --> 01:34:34,959
l'm trying to save
me Olive Oyl and me Swee'peas.

1987
01:34:35,001 --> 01:34:36,696
Olive Oyl? Swee'pea?

1988
01:34:36,736 --> 01:34:39,102
What are you doing,

01:34:46,012 --> 01:34:47,912
Oh, yeah? Well,

to your fadder?

1997
01:34:52,886 --> 01:34:54,251
You ain't me fadder.

1998
01:34:54,287 --> 01:34:55,447
Me fadder was tall and kind

1999
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:56,819
and looks like
Abraham Lincoln.

2000
01:34:56,856 --> 01:34:58,824
Yeah, don't tell me what l am.

2001
01:34:58,858 --> 01:35:00,655
Eh? Where'd he go,

2002
01:35:00,694 --> 01:35:01,922
l says l am your fadder.

2003
01:35:02,028 --> 01:35:04,929
l ought to know whose fadder
l is and whose fadder l ain't.

2004
01:35:05,031 --> 01:35:06,089
Who says?

2005
01:35:06,132 --> 01:35:08,191
l said. l said.

2006
01:35:08,234 --> 01:35:10,930
l says avast, you bilge rat,
before l use you as an anchor.

2007
01:35:10,971 --> 01:35:13,098
Bilge rat, bilge rat,
bilge rat?!

2008
01:35:13,139 --> 01:35:14,265
Mutiny, mutiny!

2009
01:35:14,307 --> 01:35:16,298
l am your one and only fadder.

2010
01:35:16,343 --> 01:35:17,435
Look it, look it--

2011
01:35:17,477 --> 01:35:19,672
Eh...
the same bulgy arms.

2012
01:35:19,713 --> 01:35:20,839
No resemblance.

2013
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:23,178
Eh, the same squinky eye, eh?

2014
01:35:23,216 --> 01:35:24,183
What squinky eye?

2015
01:35:24,217 --> 01:35:25,184
The squinky eye.

2016
01:35:25,218 --> 01:35:27,948
Help, Popeye! Oh!

2017
01:35:28,054 --> 01:35:31,683
We even got, we even
got the same pipe. Look!

2018
01:35:33,159 --> 01:35:34,421
This ain't me pipe.

2019
01:35:35,996 --> 01:35:37,224
He took the bait.

2020
01:35:37,263 --> 01:35:40,926
Eh, l've never seen anything
like this before in me life.

2021
01:35:40,967 --> 01:35:43,458
Talking to your
poor old fadder like that.

2022
01:35:43,503 --> 01:35:45,061
You disobedient brat.

2023
01:35:45,105 --> 01:35:47,972
You're spoiled--
that's what you are-- spoiled.

2024
01:35:48,008 --> 01:35:51,739
Children. Children. Kids.

2025
01:35:51,778 --> 01:35:53,871
Eh, phooey!

2026
01:35:53,913 --> 01:35:54,902
Phooey!

2027
01:35:54,948 --> 01:35:57,849
Give them everything they want,

2028
01:35:57,884 --> 01:35:59,112
and what'd you get in return?

2029
01:35:59,152 --> 01:36:01,916
Nothing, nothing.

2030
01:36:01,955 --> 01:36:03,422
Nothing but heartache,

2031
01:36:03,456 --> 01:36:05,549
heartache, sadness,
and miserky.

2032
01:36:05,592 --> 01:36:07,116
And a bad time,
once in a while,

2033
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:09,185
when you try to give them a
bath, and they don't want it.

2034
01:36:09,229 --> 01:36:11,026
And another bad time
when you want to do something

2035
01:36:11,064 --> 01:36:12,929
that you really want to do,
but all they want to do

2036
01:36:12,966 --> 01:36:14,092
is not what you want to do.

2037
01:36:14,134 --> 01:36:15,726
Bless their little hearts.

2038
01:36:15,769 --> 01:36:18,033
lf they were
really made out of gold,

2039
01:36:18,071 --> 01:36:19,732
l'd like to sell them
on the open marketplace.

2040
01:36:19,773 --> 01:36:21,707
l could make me a fortune.

2041
01:36:21,741 --> 01:36:23,072
l could've made us a fortune.
Kids!

2042
01:36:23,109 --> 01:36:27,375
Eh, they don't
know what they're doing.

2043
01:36:27,414 --> 01:36:29,939
Kids, dadblast 'em!

2044
01:36:29,983 --> 01:36:31,280
They're gonna lead you
to ruin.

2045
01:36:31,317 --> 01:36:33,581
That's what they gonna do.
Lead you to ruin.

2046
01:36:33,620 --> 01:36:35,451
They cry at you
when they're young,

2047
01:36:35,488 --> 01:36:36,921
they yell at you
when they're older,

2048
01:36:36,956 --> 01:36:39,151
they borrow from yous
when they're middle-aged,

2049
01:36:39,192 --> 01:36:40,819
and they leave you alone
to die...

2050
01:36:40,860 --> 01:36:42,384
without even paying you back!

2051
01:36:42,429 --> 01:36:45,523
Children. Phooey!

2052
01:36:46,933 --> 01:36:48,195
You give them
everything they want,

2053
01:36:48,234 --> 01:36:49,895
and what do you
get back in return?

2054
01:36:49,936 --> 01:36:51,198
You gets nothing!

2055
01:36:51,237 --> 01:36:53,535
Catch him like
a big, fat lobster.

2056
01:36:53,573 --> 01:36:55,837
Why, they're just smaller
versions of us, you know.

2057
01:36:55,875 --> 01:36:58,207
Well, l'm not so crazy
about me in the first place.

2058
01:36:58,244 --> 01:36:59,802
So why do l want
one of them?

2059
01:36:59,846 --> 01:37:02,644
l'm asking you.
Children.

2060
01:37:02,682 --> 01:37:06,243
Ah, children.
Little children.

2061
01:37:06,286 --> 01:37:07,753
You'll pour
your heart out to them,

2062
01:37:07,787 --> 01:37:09,277
you give them
everything they want,

2063
01:37:09,322 --> 01:37:10,846
give them candy,
and a lot of toys,

2064
01:37:10,890 --> 01:37:11,914
and what do you get back?

2065
01:37:11,958 --> 01:37:13,084
You get a lot of noise.

2066
01:37:13,126 --> 01:37:14,923
Nah-nah-nah-nah, nah, nah.

2067
01:37:14,961 --> 01:37:16,588
My poppa's a mean old man!

2068
01:37:19,899 --> 01:37:22,299
l'm through with children.
l'm through with kids.

2069
01:37:22,335 --> 01:37:25,862
There ain't nothing
l'm never gonna do about it.

2070
01:37:25,905 --> 01:37:28,305
There it is, Pap,
we's got 'em cornered.

2071
01:37:32,078 --> 01:37:35,309
Dad blast
that dirty bilge rat!

2072
01:37:35,348 --> 01:37:36,781
You! You,

2073
01:37:36,816 --> 01:37:38,044

2074
01:37:38,084 --> 01:37:39,278
Come up here.

2075
01:37:39,319 --> 01:37:40,286
Get up here, get up here.

2076
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:43,881
Help! Oh! Help me!

2077
01:37:43,923 --> 01:37:45,550
There she is!

2078
01:37:45,592 --> 01:37:46,889
Haul ass, haul ass.

2079
01:37:46,926 --> 01:37:48,450
Get the cannon
and move it here.

2080
01:37:48,495 --> 01:37:51,692
Come on, haul ass,
haul ass, haul ass.

2081
01:37:51,731 --> 01:37:54,291
Get the cannon
and move it here.

2082
01:37:54,334 --> 01:37:55,631
ln a good position, that's it.

2083
01:37:55,668 --> 01:37:56,965
What are you doing?

2084
01:37:57,070 --> 01:37:58,162
You can't fire that thing.

2085
01:37:58,204 --> 01:37:59,831
There's women and infants
on that boat.

2086
01:37:59,873 --> 01:38:00,840
You stop worrying.

2087
01:38:00,874 --> 01:38:04,071
All l'm gonna do
is fire a warning shot

2088
01:38:04,110 --> 01:38:05,236
right across the bow.

2089
01:38:05,278 --> 01:38:07,678
Don't you thinks
l knows what l'm doing?

2090
01:38:10,350 --> 01:38:12,045
Ah, short, short.

2091
01:38:12,085 --> 01:38:13,518
l was a little short.

2092
01:38:13,553 --> 01:38:14,918
A little short?

2093
01:38:15,021 --> 01:38:16,147
Reload it, reload it.
Reload it.

2094
01:38:16,189 --> 01:38:17,178
No, you don't.

2095
01:38:22,695 --> 01:38:24,890
Dadblast it! l missed!

01:38:26,566 --> 01:38:29,194
Full speed ahead.

2097
01:38:29,235 --> 01:38:31,032
Slow down, Pap,
so we can board her.

2098
01:38:31,070 --> 01:38:32,367
We're not gonna board her.

2099
01:38:32,405 --> 01:38:34,498
l'm gonna ram him.
l'm gonna ram him.

2100
01:38:34,541 --> 01:38:37,169
He's not going to get away
with my treasure.

2101

Me Olive and me Swee'pea

2102
01:39:11,611 --> 01:39:14,808
Ha, ha. Pirate's Cove.

2103
01:39:14,848 --> 01:39:16,509
l should've known it.

2104
01:39:16,549 --> 01:39:19,882
All right, Mr. Mean.

2105
01:39:19,919 --> 01:39:22,581
Oh, 'cause that's gonna be your
name

2106
01:39:22,622 --> 01:39:24,283
from this day forward!

2107
01:39:24,324 --> 01:39:26,884
Yeah, well, you've
broken your bail of straws

2108
01:39:26,926 --> 01:39:29,190
on this camel's back,
and just to think

2109
01:39:29,229 --> 01:39:31,789
that l was ever gonna get
engaged to you again!

2110
01:39:31,831 --> 01:39:33,662
Oh, nevermore, l say.

2111
01:39:33,700 --> 01:39:35,395
Nevermore!

2112
01:39:35,435 --> 01:39:37,096
Get the water out of the boat!

2113
01:39:37,136 --> 01:39:39,127
Lower the lifeboats.
All women first.

2114
01:39:39,172 --> 01:39:41,106
Get the water out of the boat!

2115
01:39:41,140 --> 01:39:42,607
Portly men first!

2116
01:39:51,618 --> 01:39:53,677
Oh, shit!

2117
01:39:57,523 --> 01:40:02,722
