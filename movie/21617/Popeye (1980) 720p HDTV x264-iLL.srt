1
00:00:18,434 --> 00:00:21,870
Hey, what's this,
one of Bluto's tricks?

2
00:00:21,905 --> 00:00:23,930
l'm in the wrong movie.

3
00:02:43,112 --> 00:02:48,948
Sweet Sweethaven

4
00:02:48,985 --> 00:02:54,981
God must love us

5
00:02:55,058 --> 00:03:00,724
We the people

7
00:03:06,002 --> 00:03:11,941
Hooray, hooray, Sweethaven

8
00:03:12,008 --> 00:03:17,776
Flags are wavin'

9
00:03:17,814 --> 00:03:20,282
We're people from the sea

10
00:03:20,316 --> 00:03:23,285
Safe from democracy

11
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:26,083
Sweeter than a melon tree

12
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,750
Put here for you and me

13
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:35,195
Sweethaven

14
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:40,828
Sweet Sweethaven

15
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:46,536
God must love us

16
00:03:46,576 --> 00:03:51,536
We the people

17
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:55,881
Of Sweethaven

18
00:04:12,201 --> 00:04:15,193
God must have landed here

19
00:04:15,238 --> 00:04:17,900
Why else
would he strand us here?

20
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,909
Where the air
is nice and clear

21
00:04:20,943 --> 00:04:23,207
Sweethaven
even sounds so near

22
00:04:23,246 --> 00:04:26,545
To Heaven

23
00:04:29,619 --> 00:04:36,457
God will always bless
Sweethaven

24
00:04:41,097 --> 00:04:47,832
God will always
bless Sweethaven

25
00:04:51,774 --> 00:04:59,374
God will always bless
Sweethaven.

26
00:05:19,135 --> 00:05:20,602
You just dock?

27
00:05:20,636 --> 00:05:21,796
-l have.
-Uh-huh.

28
00:05:21,838 --> 00:05:23,635
There'll be 25 cents
docking tax.

29
00:05:23,673 --> 00:05:25,072
What for?

30
00:05:25,107 --> 00:05:26,870
Where's your seacraft?

31
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:27,933
lt ain't no seacraft.

32
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,773
lt's me dinghy,
and it's under the wharf.

33
00:05:29,812 --> 00:05:30,870
Aha. Ah, huh.

34
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:31,937
This your goods?

35
00:05:31,981 --> 00:05:33,175
-They is.
-Yeah?

36
00:05:33,216 --> 00:05:34,649
You're new in town, right?

37
00:05:34,684 --> 00:05:36,777
You call this a town?

38
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:37,945
Yeah.

39
00:05:37,987 --> 00:05:39,147
Well, first of all,

40
00:05:39,188 --> 00:05:40,917
there's 1 7 cents
new-in-town tax.

41
00:05:40,957 --> 00:05:43,619
Then there's 45 cents
rowboat-under-the-wharf tax,

42
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:45,422
and one dollar

43
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:46,928
lying-around-the-wharf tax.

44
00:05:46,963 --> 00:05:48,954
So, all together,
you owe the Commodore

45
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:50,259
$1 .87.

46
00:05:50,299 --> 00:05:51,459
Ah, who's this Commodore?

47
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,263
That the nature of a question?

48
00:05:53,302 --> 00:05:55,099
There's a nickel question tax.

49
00:05:55,137 --> 00:05:56,968
Oh, forget it.
l see what you're up to here.

50
00:05:57,006 --> 00:05:58,064
Here we go.

51
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,768
Exact change, please.

52
00:05:59,809 --> 00:06:01,902
l'm an exact-change taxman.

53
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:04,003
Oh. Mmm. Here's a dollar.

54
00:06:04,046 --> 00:06:06,913
Here's a red cent.

55
00:06:06,983 --> 00:06:08,507
Here's a franc.

56
00:06:08,551 --> 00:06:09,779
A peso.

57
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:11,150
Here's a guilder.

58
00:06:11,187 --> 00:06:12,779
Oh, sorry l'm taking

59
00:06:12,822 --> 00:06:14,346
your time.

60
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,517
There's a dime; there we go.

61
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:18,151
There's one quarter.

62
00:06:18,194 --> 00:06:19,286
Curiosity tax.

63
00:06:19,328 --> 00:06:20,818
Hey, l paid me tax.

64
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:28,895
Oh, tax this, tax that.

65
00:06:28,938 --> 00:06:30,530
Ooh, my nightmare don't...

66
00:06:30,573 --> 00:06:32,165
Mmm, l gets disgustipated.

67
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,732
''Have you paid your tax?''

68
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,442
l got it, l got it.

69
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,947
No, l-l got it.

70
00:06:39,048 --> 00:06:40,845
l got it, l got it.

71
00:06:40,883 --> 00:06:42,942
Don't worry, l got it.

72
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:44,953
Holy cow.

73
00:06:45,054 --> 00:06:46,146
Looks like me old pipe.

74
00:06:46,188 --> 00:06:47,553
Wonder what it's doing here?

75
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,388
What a coinkydink.

76
00:06:55,197 --> 00:06:56,528
Hey! What is this?

77
00:06:56,565 --> 00:06:58,692
This ain't the orchestra pit.

78
00:07:15,284 --> 00:07:16,410
Oh, lookit there.

79
00:07:16,452 --> 00:07:17,885
Nobody seems to care...

80
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,751
You've got so much
to bear, ma'am.

81
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:21,051
Can l...?

82
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,422
Blow me down!

83
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:25,154
That's it, that... !

84
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,754
Oh, it's the wind and air...

85
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:31,665
Just try to double dare
to... blow me down.

86
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,259
Awk! Wait for me!

87
00:07:33,302 --> 00:07:34,929
Hello, there, mate.
Maybe, uh...

88
00:07:36,238 --> 00:07:38,229
Ah, blow me down.

89
00:07:38,274 --> 00:07:40,037
lt's no bother, but...

90
00:07:40,076 --> 00:07:41,543
Look over there--
stranger's coming.

91
00:07:41,577 --> 00:07:42,874
You'd rather not, huh?

92
00:07:42,912 --> 00:07:44,402
Well, that's easy to see.

93
00:07:44,447 --> 00:07:46,039
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm

94
00:07:46,082 --> 00:07:47,913
Wherever l go...

95
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,180
Ooh, nice-looking knees,

96
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,278
it does it for me.

97
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:53,618
Bad news!
Bad, bad, bad news.

98
00:07:53,656 --> 00:07:55,248
Hmm, l don't believe that.

99
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:56,451
What a lovely day...

100
00:07:56,492 --> 00:07:58,357
Well, it's still
a perfect day, but...

101
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,828
Oh, maybe ma'am,
you would like to...

102
00:08:00,863 --> 00:08:02,558
Blow me down again, there.

103
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:04,156
lt's a lovely place

104
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,828
Think l'd like to stay, but...

105
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:08,268
Stranger in town.

106
00:08:08,304 --> 00:08:09,498
Blow me down.

107
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:11,267
Somebody roll into town?

108
00:08:11,307 --> 00:08:14,333
Trouble, trouble,
trouble, trouble...

109
00:08:14,377 --> 00:08:16,607
Blow me down--
local glum club.

110
00:08:16,645 --> 00:08:18,272
lt's friendly here...

111
00:08:18,314 --> 00:08:19,406
A little scary, too.

112
00:08:19,448 --> 00:08:20,881
l think l'll spend a year,

113
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,247
Or two, maybe thr...

114
00:08:22,284 --> 00:08:24,184
Whoa, tut-tut-tut.

115
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:28,748
l yam what l yam,
wherever l go

116
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,555
l came from the sea...

117
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,255
Should've got me number,

118
00:08:33,295 --> 00:08:35,889
but no one's looking it up,
ain't it?

119
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,424
Oh...

120
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:39,559
Good day. . . Good day.

121
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,660
l hate you to pieces!

122
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,228
Kind of a greasy good day,
but that's all right.

123
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,707
Bunch of carrotsk?

124
00:08:48,744 --> 00:08:50,439
No, no.

125
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:51,741
You ain't got no carrotsk?

126
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:52,941
What are those, prunes?

127
00:08:52,982 --> 00:08:54,313
Phooey on carrots!

128
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,215
Take broccoli.

129
00:08:56,252 --> 00:08:58,379
l am in the mood for carrotsk.

130
00:08:58,421 --> 00:08:59,820
l need me vitamins.

131
00:08:59,855 --> 00:09:01,254
Phooey on carrots!

132
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,314
Take spinach!

133
00:09:02,358 --> 00:09:04,883
lf l wants spinach,
l'll axk you for spinach.

134
00:09:04,994 --> 00:09:07,326
So, why you didn't say so?

135
00:09:07,363 --> 00:09:09,558
For you, each a dollar.

136
00:09:09,598 --> 00:09:10,895
How much is the broccoli?

137
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:11,900
Nickel, maybe dime.

138
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:13,025
And the spinach?

139
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:14,093
Dime, maybe quarter.

140
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,626
Then how come
carrotsk is a dollar?

141
00:09:15,671 --> 00:09:16,660
Dollar fifty.

142
00:09:16,705 --> 00:09:18,400
You buy what l don't feel
like selling,

143
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:19,430
it'll cost you $2.

144
00:09:20,943 --> 00:09:22,535
All right, here you go.

145
00:09:22,578 --> 00:09:24,102
Uh-uh-uh-uh!

146
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:26,774
Hey, deadbeat, this is a nickel.

147
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,444
l pays what l feels like paying.

148
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,683
You're not up to no good,
are you?

149
00:09:32,721 --> 00:09:35,554
'Cause if you are, there's
a 50-cent up-to-no-good tax.

150
00:09:38,794 --> 00:09:40,557
Come here! Come back!

151
00:09:40,596 --> 00:09:42,723
Seems like everywhere

152
00:09:42,765 --> 00:09:44,733
Lots of people here

153
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:46,667
Try to blow me down...

154
00:09:47,937 --> 00:09:50,599
Unlike the clothes l wear

155
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,799
l haven't...

156
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,331
Careful, there.

157
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,343
What blew him into town?

158
00:09:55,377 --> 00:09:57,345
Oh, the short arm of the law,
huh?

159
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:01,839
Blow me down

160
00:10:01,884 --> 00:10:03,146
Blow me down...

161
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,914
Ow!

162
00:10:04,954 --> 00:10:08,685
Hey, come ba... hey, hey-- ah!

163
00:10:18,501 --> 00:10:20,628
Uh, are you the piano tuner

164
00:10:20,669 --> 00:10:22,967
or the man
with the party favor?

165
00:10:23,005 --> 00:10:24,700
You got a room for renk?

166
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,968
What for what?

167
00:10:26,075 --> 00:10:29,374
Renk, renk-- your sign says you
got a room for renk.

168
00:10:29,411 --> 00:10:31,777
Oh, my stars and gardens!

169
00:10:31,814 --> 00:10:33,782
My mind was
a million miles away.

170
00:10:33,816 --> 00:10:36,478
Come in before you catch
your death of mud.

171
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:37,952
''Mud.''

172
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:42,257
''Oyls.'' That explains it.

173
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,781
She's down a quart.

174
00:10:43,826 --> 00:10:46,795
Scums-- l'll find you.

175
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:49,627
Come on, come on!

176
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:54,465
Mmm. Don't make them
like they used to.

177
00:10:55,934 --> 00:10:57,629
Oh, come on.

178
00:11:02,374 --> 00:11:04,365
Oh!

179
00:11:06,411 --> 00:11:08,402
l'm sorry, Mother,
but it's ugly.

180
00:11:08,447 --> 00:11:11,382
l ask you, have you ever
seen anything so ugly?

181
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,350
l won't be engaged
in this hat.

182
00:11:13,385 --> 00:11:14,682
l heard that.

183
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,312
Don't think
l didn't hear that.

184
00:11:16,355 --> 00:11:17,686
Oh...

185
00:11:17,723 --> 00:11:19,213
She owes me an apology.

186
00:11:19,258 --> 00:11:20,486
Oh... ugly.

187
00:11:20,526 --> 00:11:22,619
There's nothing left to say.

188
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:23,992
What do you think?

189
00:11:24,096 --> 00:11:26,291
l think it's up to you, dear.

190
00:11:26,331 --> 00:11:29,095
Well, what do you think? Ugly.

191
00:11:29,134 --> 00:11:31,659
l think it's a conspiracy.

192
00:11:31,703 --> 00:11:33,000
Oh...

193
00:11:33,071 --> 00:11:35,835
Why would they manufacture
deliberate ugliness

194
00:11:35,874 --> 00:11:37,967
unless they wanted me
to look ugly?

195
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,774
lf we find that out,
we find out everything.

196
00:11:40,812 --> 00:11:43,280
There's a stranger
in t... um... ooh...

197
00:11:43,315 --> 00:11:44,407
Oh...

198
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:45,609
l can't get engaged.

199
00:11:45,651 --> 00:11:47,710
You'll have to tell
Bluto; l can't.

200
00:11:47,753 --> 00:11:49,516
We'll have to cancel the party

201
00:11:49,555 --> 00:11:50,647
tomorrow night.

202
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:52,179
lt's not my fault
that it's so ugly.

203
00:11:53,258 --> 00:11:54,350
What are you doing

204
00:11:54,393 --> 00:11:55,951
listening in on
a private conversation

205
00:11:55,994 --> 00:11:57,120
between me and my mother?

206
00:11:57,162 --> 00:12:00,063
l have a good mind to have
my father call a policeman.

207
00:12:00,098 --> 00:12:02,532
Olive, will you show
Mister... Mister...?

208
00:12:02,568 --> 00:12:03,660
Oh. Popeye, ma'am.

209
00:12:03,702 --> 00:12:04,930
... Mr. Eye

210
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,096
the spare room?

211
00:12:06,138 --> 00:12:07,230
Just Popeye, ma'am.

212
00:12:07,272 --> 00:12:08,239
Go upstairs, Mr. Eye.

213
00:12:08,273 --> 00:12:09,433
Olive will show you the room.

214
00:12:09,474 --> 00:12:10,406
Thanks.

215
00:12:11,476 --> 00:12:12,909
Some kind of asylum here.

216
00:12:12,945 --> 00:12:13,969
Show me a room.

217
00:12:14,012 --> 00:12:15,206
Show me some courtesy

218
00:12:15,247 --> 00:12:16,214
might be nice.

219
00:12:16,248 --> 00:12:17,715
l don't see why
l have to do anything

220
00:12:17,749 --> 00:12:19,216
on the day
before my engagement party

221
00:12:19,251 --> 00:12:20,718
when nothing's ready,
especially me.

222
00:12:20,752 --> 00:12:22,982
And what kind of name is that,
anyway-- Popeye?

223
00:12:23,055 --> 00:12:24,215
Pretty strange.

224
00:12:24,256 --> 00:12:26,121
What kind of name is Olive Oyl?

225
00:12:26,158 --> 00:12:28,319
Sounds like
some kind of lubricants.

226
00:12:29,394 --> 00:12:30,725
Thank you very much, ma'am.

227
00:12:31,797 --> 00:12:33,822
Don't look in that room;
that's my room.

228
00:12:33,865 --> 00:12:35,332
Meant no disrespect there.

229
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:36,698
Ugly, huh?

230
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,532
You owe me an apology.

231
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:39,696
What?

232
00:12:39,738 --> 00:12:41,501
Wonder who shoved
a feather in his ear?

233
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,507
What'd you say?

234
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,566
Sure is nice weather
you have here.

235
00:12:47,713 --> 00:12:49,010
Your name really Olives?

236
00:12:49,047 --> 00:12:50,344
So what?

237
00:12:50,382 --> 00:12:51,349
Olives Oyl?

238
00:12:52,484 --> 00:12:54,213
You don't look Greek to me.

239
00:12:54,252 --> 00:12:55,412
So, you're short.

240
00:12:55,454 --> 00:12:57,547
Or are you just passing
yourself off as short?

241
00:12:57,589 --> 00:12:59,682
Can l see me room now?

242
00:12:59,725 --> 00:13:01,590
Ooh, as if l cared.

243
00:13:01,627 --> 00:13:03,424
Let me give you a hand there.

244
00:13:03,462 --> 00:13:04,429
Maybe it needs a little oil.

245
00:13:04,463 --> 00:13:05,452
Oh!

246
00:13:06,798 --> 00:13:08,060
Oh, oh...

247
00:13:12,437 --> 00:13:15,235
Nice-looking room.

248
00:13:19,311 --> 00:13:22,769
Never seen a room done
in early demolish-kin before,

249
00:13:22,814 --> 00:13:24,304
but this'll do for me.

250
00:13:24,349 --> 00:13:26,579
Careful how you treat
that bed.

251
00:13:26,618 --> 00:13:28,381
Nothing goes on this bed.

252
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,682
Sorry, ma'am, it's just some...

253
00:13:29,721 --> 00:13:31,689
Watch that lamp!

254
00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:33,691
Let me give you some assistance.

255
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:35,090
Here, give me your hand.

256
00:13:35,127 --> 00:13:37,095
There, that's it.
Yeah, here we go.

257
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:38,289
Oh, you're in first.

258
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,992
ls that... oh...
Boy, is it hot in here.

259
00:13:41,066 --> 00:13:42,465
l still respect you.

260
00:13:42,501 --> 00:13:43,490
Ooh!

261
00:13:47,939 --> 00:13:49,998
Me bad eye, didn't see that.

262
00:13:50,042 --> 00:13:51,031
Hmph!

263
00:13:55,747 --> 00:13:57,180
Thanks for your help.

264
00:13:57,215 --> 00:14:00,184
Uh, Miss Oyl, maybe...

265
00:14:09,594 --> 00:14:11,653
Don't forget to put
the cat out, dear.

266
00:14:11,697 --> 00:14:13,392
We don't have a cat.

267
00:14:13,432 --> 00:14:14,729
Eau de toilette.

268
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:16,529
Yeah, eau de toilette.

269
00:14:17,602 --> 00:14:18,899
Yeah.

270
00:14:19,971 --> 00:14:21,063
How do you like that?

271
00:14:21,106 --> 00:14:22,903
Gold is up 20 cents,
two dollars an ounce.

272
00:14:22,941 --> 00:14:24,203
Out of my kitchen, Mr. Wimpy.

273
00:14:24,242 --> 00:14:25,470
l knew it, l knew it, see...

274
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,807
You wait for the supper gong.

275
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:28,437
l could've made
a fortune on Billings

276
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,846
if Bluto would've let me go
directly to the Commodore.

277
00:14:30,882 --> 00:14:32,873
He's so jealous of me,
that Bluto.

278
00:14:32,918 --> 00:14:34,613
Well, who wouldn't be?

279
00:14:34,653 --> 00:14:36,382
Me, l'm not jealous of Castor.

280
00:14:36,421 --> 00:14:37,445
He's my son.

281
00:14:37,489 --> 00:14:39,252
Man jealous of his own son.

282
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,781
You owe me an apology.

283
00:14:40,826 --> 00:14:41,986
l didn't mean you.

284
00:14:42,027 --> 00:14:44,723
Never lets me go
to the Commodore.

285
00:14:44,763 --> 00:14:47,231
Commodore is a paragon
of sagacity.

286
00:14:47,265 --> 00:14:49,631
lf ever l could
put in a good word...

287
00:14:49,668 --> 00:14:50,635
''Shut up'' is the word.

288
00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:52,159
''Pass'' is another word
that Wimpy...

289
00:14:52,204 --> 00:14:53,262
You don't pass.

290
00:14:53,305 --> 00:14:56,001
He should be killed to death.

291
00:14:56,108 --> 00:14:58,906
lt says here the Commodore's
taxing salt again.

292
00:14:58,944 --> 00:15:01,435
Don't look as good as l smell,
but too late now.

293
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,811
Got to go.

294
00:15:02,848 --> 00:15:07,478
Oh, Mr. Eye,
have you met-- uh, Pop?

295
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,952
Mr. Wimpy, my son Castor,

296
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,954
Mr. Geezil, my husband Cole.

297
00:15:11,022 --> 00:15:13,115
We're all one big
happy family here.

298
00:15:13,158 --> 00:15:15,126
-Hmph!
-Although not really.

299
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,128
l mean, well, Mr. Geezil
and Mr. Wimpy are, um...

300
00:15:17,162 --> 00:15:18,459
Me, l'm family.

301
00:15:18,497 --> 00:15:20,556
Well, you're my husband.

302
00:15:20,599 --> 00:15:22,499
You owe me an apology.

303
00:15:22,534 --> 00:15:24,968
Well, l can't find anything.

304
00:15:25,003 --> 00:15:26,527
What are you
looking for, Olive?

305
00:15:26,571 --> 00:15:28,095
-A glass.
-Oh, uh, here's a glass.

306
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,767
That's a short, fat, ugly glass.

307
00:15:29,808 --> 00:15:31,298
l want a tall, pretty,
slender glass.

308
00:15:31,343 --> 00:15:32,310
They're all broken.

309
00:15:32,344 --> 00:15:33,470
l could've made a fortune

310
00:15:33,512 --> 00:15:34,638
-in fish futures...
-Fish?

311
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:36,510
but l'd have to dip
into capital.

312
00:15:36,548 --> 00:15:38,516
Fish futures smell.

313
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,950
What kind of glass
do you want, Olive?

314
00:15:40,986 --> 00:15:41,975
A wine glass

315
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,818
or a brandy glass,
or a water glass?

316
00:15:44,856 --> 00:15:46,619
Oh, not a thing--
l don't want a thing.

317
00:15:46,658 --> 00:15:47,625
Real appetizing.

318
00:15:47,659 --> 00:15:48,626
l want a fork.

319
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,752
Right beside your plate.

320
00:15:49,795 --> 00:15:51,490
lf it was a knife,
it would cut you.

321
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,758
-And a knife.
-Will you sit down?

322
00:15:52,798 --> 00:15:54,493
Why don't l have a knife?
And a nice dress?

323
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:56,057
You owe me an apology.

324
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,760
Passing fish, please.

325
00:15:59,805 --> 00:16:01,295
Fish, excellent idea, Miss Oyl.

326
00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:03,204
l would suggest before
matrimony, fish.

327
00:16:03,241 --> 00:16:05,300
Fish before matrimony.

328
00:16:05,343 --> 00:16:07,334
Ooh, that does look good, there.

329
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:09,540
Wish l had a plate though.

330
00:16:09,581 --> 00:16:13,312
...because four times
engaged is three times much.

331
00:16:13,351 --> 00:16:15,683
Oh, he can't talk me out
of anything; l'm not a child.

332
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,948
l'll say you're not a child.

333
00:16:16,988 --> 00:16:19,718
-Who says l'm not a child?
-You said you're not a child

334
00:16:19,758 --> 00:16:20,782
and l agreed with you,
that's who.

335
00:16:20,826 --> 00:16:21,850
Who asked you
to agree with me?

336
00:16:21,893 --> 00:16:23,383
Well, no one can stop me
from agreeing with you

337
00:16:23,428 --> 00:16:24,952
-if l want to.
-l can.

338
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,190
Quarreling at my table.

339
00:16:26,231 --> 00:16:27,664
You both owe me an apology.

340
00:16:27,699 --> 00:16:29,166
Sorry, Pop.

341
00:16:29,201 --> 00:16:29,690
What?

342
00:16:29,734 --> 00:16:30,826
Please pass the shrimp,

343
00:16:30,869 --> 00:16:31,961
chicken and meatballs.

344
00:16:32,003 --> 00:16:34,369
Well, l don't know.

345
00:16:34,406 --> 00:16:37,375
Captain Bluto has
the patience of Job.

346
00:16:37,409 --> 00:16:38,398
Or is it job?

347
00:16:38,443 --> 00:16:41,173
Certainly got
a very good job, Job.

348
00:16:41,213 --> 00:16:43,704
And he needs
a lot of patience.

349
00:16:43,748 --> 00:16:45,841
Why, he runs this town
for the Commodore

350
00:16:45,884 --> 00:16:46,851
while he's away.

351
00:16:46,885 --> 00:16:48,318
And the Commodore's
always away.

352
00:16:48,353 --> 00:16:50,150
As a matter of fact,
l've never seen him.

353
00:16:50,188 --> 00:16:51,348
-Have you, Cole?
-What?

354
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:53,653
l'd never let a girl
break my engagement.

355
00:16:53,692 --> 00:16:56,490
l'd break her nose before
she broke my engagement.

356
00:16:56,528 --> 00:16:59,554
And you better not try on me
what you pulled on Bluto,

357
00:16:59,598 --> 00:17:01,725
because l'm no pushover.

358
00:17:01,766 --> 00:17:03,597
You owe your sister
an apology.

359
00:17:03,635 --> 00:17:05,125
Will you stop fidgeting?

360
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,432
Finishing touch here.

361
00:17:06,471 --> 00:17:08,336
Oh, this knife won't cut.

362
00:17:08,373 --> 00:17:09,362
Here, take mine.

363
00:17:09,407 --> 00:17:10,374
Not since l was child

364
00:17:10,408 --> 00:17:12,137
have we had a sharp knife
in this house.

365
00:17:12,177 --> 00:17:13,667
You owe me an apology.

366
00:17:13,712 --> 00:17:15,145
You don't like our knives.

367
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,580
Bluto's rich, he can buy you
plenty of knives.

368
00:17:17,616 --> 00:17:20,084
Ooh, l hate this table,
it's ugly.

369
00:17:20,118 --> 00:17:21,517
l'm the only one
with nerve enough

370
00:17:21,553 --> 00:17:22,679
to tell the truth about it.

371
00:17:22,721 --> 00:17:24,746
Well, then, why don't you
let Bluto the pushover

372
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:25,756
buy you a new table?

373
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:26,757
-Am l right, Pop?
-Right.

374
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:27,758
l'm right, right?

375
00:17:27,792 --> 00:17:28,759
-You're right.
-Right.

376
00:17:28,793 --> 00:17:29,953
Nothing left?

377
00:17:30,061 --> 00:17:31,790
Oh... Bluto, Bluto, Bluto.

378
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,594
Everyone takes advantage
of my poor Bluto.

379
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:36,760
Get a new... glass,
a new knife.

380
00:17:36,801 --> 00:17:38,701
Now they want a table.
Well, hmph!

381
00:17:38,737 --> 00:17:40,204
That's why l always
have to break off

382
00:17:40,238 --> 00:17:41,535
our engagement--
to stop you all

383
00:17:41,573 --> 00:17:43,063
from taking advantage
of the sweetest,

384
00:17:43,108 --> 00:17:44,837
most humble man
on the face of this Earth!

385
00:17:44,876 --> 00:17:45,843
Hmph.

386
00:17:45,877 --> 00:17:46,935
Mmm.

387
00:17:50,448 --> 00:17:51,472
You make me sick.

388
00:17:54,986 --> 00:17:57,921
Never good to be too full,
l guess.

389
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,814
lt's 9:00!

390
00:18:50,856 --> 00:18:52,756
Curfew!

391
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:55,817
Lights... out!

392
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,837
You can have a kiss now.

393
00:19:13,912 --> 00:19:15,345
Oh!

394
00:19:19,985 --> 00:19:21,509
Poppa.

395
00:19:21,553 --> 00:19:23,282
Pretty soon you and me

396
00:19:23,322 --> 00:19:25,950
are going to be together again,
huh?

397
00:19:26,058 --> 00:19:27,491
Yeah.

398
00:19:27,526 --> 00:19:30,791
30 years ain't that long.

399
00:19:30,829 --> 00:19:34,822
Besides, next Wednesday's
our annual-versity.

400
00:19:34,867 --> 00:19:36,528
Yeah? Yeah.

401
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,930

00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:43,441
That's all l'm axskin you.

403
00:19:46,845 --> 00:19:48,938

Sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep.

00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:25,240
Sweep, sweep...

408

Ah... whoop!

00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:33,821
Eee-oh!

411
00:20:34,927 --> 00:20:38,863
Everything

412
00:20:40,032 --> 00:20:43,365
Everything is food to go

413
00:20:43,402 --> 00:20:48,465
Everything is food
for thought

414
00:20:48,507 --> 00:20:51,670
Everything you knead

415
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:55,009
lt is food

416

417
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:06,119
Everything is meat, meat, meat

418

Careful what you put
on your feet

419
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:14,529
Once it lived on an ani-mule

00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:17,967
Now it walks along with you

421

422
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:25,532

426
00:21:47,966 --> 00:21:52,164
Everything is food to go now

427
00:21:52,204 --> 00:21:55,935
Everything is
fast-food chains

428
00:21:55,974 --> 00:21:59,740
From your lemon
to your sugarcane

430
00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:06,712
Everything is food

431
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:10,588
Did you order a hamburger?

432
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:11,987
Yeah, l ordered a hamburger.

433
00:22:12,024 --> 00:22:13,491
That's what l got,
a hamburger.

434
00:22:13,525 --> 00:22:14,492
No, l beg to disagree.

435
00:22:14,526 --> 00:22:15,720
Rough House,

436
00:22:15,761 --> 00:22:16,728

438
00:22:17,996 --> 00:22:19,293
Who's paying?

439
00:22:19,331 --> 00:22:20,593
l'm buying, he's paying.

440
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:22,122
A nickel hamburger tax?

441
00:22:22,167 --> 00:22:23,759
l'd refuse to pay
if l were you.

442
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:25,133
A shocking abuse of power.

443
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:27,468
Rough House!

444
00:22:29,074 --> 00:22:32,532
Food, food, food

00:22:32,578 --> 00:22:35,979
Everything is food

446
00:22:36,014 --> 00:22:38,608

He would gladly pay you

450
00:23:03,308 --> 00:23:06,141
Everything is upside-down

451
00:23:08,213 --> 00:23:12,149
Everything is sunny-side up

452
00:23:12,184 --> 00:23:14,277
Did you pay for this

453
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:16,287
ln American?

454
00:23:16,321 --> 00:23:19,347
They can't trick us
with no hot dog

455
00:23:19,391 --> 00:23:23,327
Everything is food,
food, food

456
00:23:23,362 --> 00:23:26,763
Everything is food.

457
00:23:35,941 --> 00:23:38,239
Hey, hey, hey, Laverne!

Give us a smooch!

459
00:23:42,681 --> 00:23:45,673
l really need someone
to kind of talk to,

460
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:48,015
'cause l thought everybody
in this town might be deef.

461
00:23:48,086 --> 00:23:49,018
Huh, what's that?

462
00:23:49,087 --> 00:23:50,019
Huh? Oh.

463
00:23:52,658 --> 00:23:54,626
You know, jusk why
l'm here is...

464
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,890
l'm looking for me pap.

465
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,895
Yeah, oh...

466
00:23:57,929 --> 00:23:59,658
l've searched
the seven seas for him,

467
00:23:59,698 --> 00:24:01,427
and l haven't found him yet.

468
00:24:01,466 --> 00:24:04,697
l was only two years old,
me own pap left me.

469
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:06,431
l was just a mere infink.

470
00:24:06,471 --> 00:24:07,836
Me own pap...

471
00:24:07,873 --> 00:24:10,273
Pipe down, will ya?

472
00:24:10,308 --> 00:24:12,572
Me own pap ditches me.

473
00:24:12,611 --> 00:24:13,737
l'm a very tolerant man,

474
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:15,747
except when it comes
to holding a grudge.

475
00:24:15,781 --> 00:24:17,908
l never thought
l'd forgive me paps,

476
00:24:17,949 --> 00:24:19,439
but about seven years ago,

477
00:24:19,484 --> 00:24:22,078
l ships out on this boat,
The Gloomy Gus.

478
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,851
That's a boat. Yeah.

479
00:24:25,891 --> 00:24:27,586
Just off the coast of Guam.

480
00:24:27,626 --> 00:24:29,218
lt breaks up on this typhoon,

481
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:31,388
and l'm stuck on
this raft for 45 days

482
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,692
without food or waters.

483
00:24:32,731 --> 00:24:35,393
But after all
this time on this raft,

484
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:37,493
this visiktation comes to me.

485
00:24:37,536 --> 00:24:42,337
Looks just like me mother,
rest her soul.

486
00:24:42,374 --> 00:24:46,504
And it says,
''Your pap is still alive.''

487
00:24:46,545 --> 00:24:47,477
Excuse me.

488
00:24:49,147 --> 00:24:52,014
So, when l was finally rescued,

489
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:54,575
l figured out that l got
to forgive me paps, you know?

490
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:55,643
Uh, you see,

491
00:24:55,687 --> 00:24:58,212
l'm only afeared
that he might be dead,

492
00:24:58,256 --> 00:25:00,486
and never realize what a
fine figure of an orphink

493
00:25:00,525 --> 00:25:01,856
l turned out to be.

494
00:25:01,893 --> 00:25:04,123
You sure got a nice-looking
face there,

495
00:25:04,162 --> 00:25:06,062
One-Eye.

496
00:25:07,733 --> 00:25:09,257
One-Eye?

Not a mandolin

623
00:32:58,333 --> 00:33:00,665
Oh, no

624
00:33:00,702 --> 00:33:02,693
He's an accordion

625
00:33:04,672 --> 00:33:09,336

each night to keep him warm

Oh, boy

00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,421
He's virile

629
00:33:22,457 --> 00:33:24,152
And he's strong

630
00:33:24,192 --> 00:33:25,887

Sounds like Fluto.

636
00:33:32,734 --> 00:33:33,894
Bluto.

637
00:33:33,935 --> 00:33:35,163
Bluto.

638
00:33:35,203 --> 00:33:36,170
At your services, sir.

639
00:33:36,204 --> 00:33:37,967
There's a good picture
in the paper this week.

640
00:33:38,006 --> 00:33:38,973
A lovely present for you

641
00:33:39,007 --> 00:33:40,406
down at the pawn shop,
Captain Bluto.

642
00:33:40,441 --> 00:33:42,170
l would have brought it,
but it was too late.

643
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:43,370
Anytime you want me to come by

644
00:33:43,411 --> 00:33:45,345
and stain up the boat,
Captain Bluto.

645
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,041

He's got money and respect

647
00:33:51,352 --> 00:33:52,683
That's true

648
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,555
He's better than the rest

649
00:33:57,592 --> 00:33:59,287
That's true

650
00:33:59,327 --> 00:34:03,787
He may not be the best

651
00:34:05,099 --> 00:34:07,226
But he's large

652
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:09,595
And he's mine...

653
00:34:09,637 --> 00:34:10,831
She can have him.

654
00:34:10,872 --> 00:34:11,998
Yeah.

655
00:34:12,073 --> 00:34:13,631
She loves me.

656
00:34:16,711 --> 00:34:18,679
Of course she does.

657
00:34:18,713 --> 00:34:20,510
She don't love me.

658
00:34:20,548 --> 00:34:21,674
Oh, no.

659
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,814
She'll marry me.

660
00:34:29,157 --> 00:34:31,853

00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:43,403
She won't marry me.

669
00:34:44,472 --> 00:34:45,404
Oh.

670
00:34:50,111 --> 00:34:51,237
She will.

671
00:34:55,516 --> 00:34:57,381
She won't.

672
00:35:04,992 --> 00:35:10,259
lt may seem funny,
but it's not

673
00:35:10,298 --> 00:35:11,993
Oh, no

674
00:35:12,033 --> 00:35:14,558
l'm thankful

675
00:35:14,602 --> 00:35:16,627
For what l've got

676
00:35:16,671 --> 00:35:17,899
Me, too

677
00:35:17,939 --> 00:35:22,876
lt may not be a lot

678
00:35:24,278 --> 00:35:27,645
But he's large.

679
00:35:30,852 --> 00:35:31,819
She will.

680
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,578
Yes, yes.

681
00:35:37,658 --> 00:35:39,592
She...

682
00:35:43,598 --> 00:35:47,398
Faulty flower...
C-Captain Bluto.

683
00:35:52,507 --> 00:35:54,839
Mrs. Oyl, Olive's...

684
00:35:54,876 --> 00:35:56,844
Olive's what?

685
00:35:56,878 --> 00:35:58,368
Olive's...

686
00:35:59,714 --> 00:36:02,205
...getting ready.

687
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,218
Good.

688
00:36:04,252 --> 00:36:05,378
Now, where were we?

689
00:36:05,419 --> 00:36:08,718
Uh, she won't
marry you, she...

690
00:36:12,326 --> 00:36:14,260
She will!

691
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:18,161
Oh, my word!

692
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,632
Son-in-law.

693
00:36:24,172 --> 00:36:25,935
Oh, yeah, yeah.

694
00:36:25,973 --> 00:36:27,133
Ah! Ooh.

695
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:54,153
Olive!

696
00:37:09,044 --> 00:37:11,205
Marvelous, marvelous.

697
00:37:11,246 --> 00:37:12,838
No place to go.

698
00:37:12,881 --> 00:37:14,872
Can't go to no party
without an invite.

699
00:37:14,917 --> 00:37:15,906
Whoo!

700
00:37:17,019 --> 00:37:19,180
-Ho, ho, ho, whoa.
-Whoo! Ooh.

701
00:37:19,221 --> 00:37:20,518
-Miss Oyl.
-Oh...

702
00:37:20,556 --> 00:37:21,750
You scared the wits out of me.

703
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:23,587
Yeah, l almost knocked 'em
out of you, too.

704
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:25,217
-Sorry l did that to you.
-What right do you have

705
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,023
to lurk here in the dark
in the middle of the night

706
00:37:27,129 --> 00:37:28,357
and scare the wits
out of a person?

707
00:37:28,397 --> 00:37:30,194
l wasn't.
l was just, uh, kind of, uh...

708
00:37:30,232 --> 00:37:31,199
Oh, oh.

709
00:37:31,233 --> 00:37:33,030
How's your party going,
Miss Oyl?

710
00:37:33,068 --> 00:37:34,899
-Oh, that's a dumb question.
-Yeah.

711
00:37:34,937 --> 00:37:37,201
Where do you think l'm headed
right this minute?

712
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:38,604
Um... well, uh,

713
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,868
mmm, that way, l think.

714
00:37:39,908 --> 00:37:40,875
Out of town.

715
00:37:40,909 --> 00:37:42,467
-l am not headed out of town.
-Oh.

716
00:37:42,511 --> 00:37:44,672
Don't you see which
direction l'm facing?

717
00:37:44,713 --> 00:37:46,442
-You're going, now you're...
-Oh, ooh, whoa.

718
00:37:46,482 --> 00:37:47,506
-Now you're facing east.
-Oh.

719
00:37:47,549 --> 00:37:48,675
Maybe a little southwest.

720
00:37:48,717 --> 00:37:49,877
-Place your bets.
-Oh. Oh!

721
00:37:49,918 --> 00:37:52,045
You need some help with
your bags there, Miss Oyl?

722
00:37:52,087 --> 00:37:53,452
-Ooh, oh, no.
-l didn't touch ya.

723
00:37:53,489 --> 00:37:54,547
l didn't mean to hurt ya.

724
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:55,750
Thank you.

725
00:37:55,791 --> 00:37:57,224
-Oh, you do.
-Oh.

726
00:38:00,863 --> 00:38:01,989
Oh.

727
00:38:02,031 --> 00:38:05,000
No, that's the wrong way.

728
00:38:05,034 --> 00:38:06,023
Oh.

729
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:08,999
No, that's the wrong way.

730
00:38:09,038 --> 00:38:10,505
l want to go...

731
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,269
Oh...

732
00:38:13,308 --> 00:38:14,741
Oh, oh...

733
00:38:14,777 --> 00:38:16,677
Whoo! Oh. Oh, oh.

734
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:17,872
Oh!

735
00:38:17,913 --> 00:38:19,005
Oh, oh...

736
00:38:19,048 --> 00:38:20,015
Oh...

737
00:38:20,115 --> 00:38:21,173
That way.

738
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:22,183
That'll be 50 cents

739
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:23,514
impersonating-a-traffic-cop tax.

740
00:38:23,552 --> 00:38:24,519
What?

741
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:25,815
Oh.

742
00:38:25,854 --> 00:38:27,014
l'm sorry, Miss Oyl.

743
00:38:27,122 --> 00:38:29,317
Didn't recognize you
from the back.

744
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:31,189
lt won't happen again.

745
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:33,421
How come Miss Oyl
don't have to pay no taxes?

746
00:38:33,462 --> 00:38:35,794
That's ten cents question tax.

747
00:38:35,831 --> 00:38:38,925
But... l'll let you off
this time

748
00:38:38,967 --> 00:38:40,832
since you're with Miss Oyl.

749
00:38:40,869 --> 00:38:42,359
Good night, Miss Oyl.

750
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:43,894
Well, how come being
with Miss Oyl

751
00:38:43,939 --> 00:38:46,203
means l don't have
to pay no...

752
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:47,572
...taxes?

753
00:38:47,609 --> 00:38:51,238
Well, l don't know
what you're talking about.

754
00:38:54,683 --> 00:38:58,312
Here's a nice cup of tea
for you, Captain Bluto,

755
00:38:58,353 --> 00:38:59,684
while you're waiting.

756
00:39:05,027 --> 00:39:08,190
Where's Olive?

757
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,595
Olive?

758
00:39:09,631 --> 00:39:10,859
You think everyone pays taxes

759
00:39:10,899 --> 00:39:12,594
but me and my family,
don't you? Mm-hmm.

760
00:39:12,634 --> 00:39:13,999
Well, you couldn't be
more wrong.

761
00:39:14,069 --> 00:39:15,559
lf l'm wrong, why
am l in the right?

762
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:17,435
You think it's because
l'm engaged to Bluto

763
00:39:17,473 --> 00:39:19,202
and Bluto runs the town
for the Commodore

764
00:39:19,241 --> 00:39:20,333
so we get special favors.

765
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:21,433
Well, it's a lie. Hmm.

766
00:39:21,477 --> 00:39:23,035
Olive!

767
00:39:29,218 --> 00:39:30,583
Bluto is kind and generous

768
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:32,814
and likes to do things
for his loved ones.

769
00:39:34,056 --> 00:39:35,683
And you want me to
hurt his feelings.

770
00:39:35,724 --> 00:39:36,986
Well, phooey on you.

771
00:39:38,393 --> 00:39:41,157
Hmm. You don't even care
enough about me or my family

772
00:39:41,196 --> 00:39:42,720
to be at my engagement party.

773
00:39:42,764 --> 00:39:45,597
And what are you doing here
in Sweethaven anyway, hmm?

774
00:39:45,634 --> 00:39:47,534
Well, l'm-l'm looking
for me pap.

775
00:39:47,569 --> 00:39:48,661
-Mmm.
-Yeah.

776
00:39:48,704 --> 00:39:51,798
Oh, well, if that's true,
then where is he?

777
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,001
Well, yeah, um, got me there.

778
00:39:54,042 --> 00:39:55,532
l don't really know.

779
00:39:55,577 --> 00:39:57,204
l... l got this sense

780
00:39:57,246 --> 00:39:58,975
that he's here though,
you know?

781
00:39:59,014 --> 00:40:01,039
Oh, well, all right,
l'll wait. Hmm.

782
00:40:01,083 --> 00:40:03,551
Anyway, there are too
many guests as it is.

783
00:40:03,585 --> 00:40:04,711
Half of them l hate.

784
00:40:22,938 --> 00:40:24,565
One thing l remember
about me pap

785
00:40:24,606 --> 00:40:27,074
was that he always used
to throw me up in the air.

786
00:40:27,176 --> 00:40:29,804
But he'd never be there
when l come down, you know.

787
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:31,073
-Heh, heh, heh.
-Mmm.

788
00:40:31,113 --> 00:40:33,013
Boy, he had a sense ka humor,
didn't he?

789
00:40:33,048 --> 00:40:34,242
Yeah, that was me pap.

790
00:40:34,283 --> 00:40:36,046
l remember that time
he gave me

791
00:40:36,084 --> 00:40:37,574
an electric eel as a toy.

792
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:38,745
Eep!

793
00:40:38,787 --> 00:40:40,084
Yeah, that was fun.

794
00:40:40,122 --> 00:40:41,248
Or he'd rock me in my cradle

795
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:43,258
real, real, real hard
and l'd lose me formula.

796
00:40:43,292 --> 00:40:46,750
And then he'd say, ''One
day, you'll be a sailor.''

797
00:40:46,795 --> 00:40:49,491
That... that's what
l am today.

798
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:52,398
Yeah. Sometimes,
he'd bounce me on his knee.

799
00:40:52,434 --> 00:40:54,265
Most of the time
he'd miss, though

800
00:40:54,303 --> 00:40:56,737
'cause he couldn't see
too well with one eye.

801
00:40:58,207 --> 00:40:59,538
Oh, me pap, yeah.

802
00:40:59,575 --> 00:41:01,873
Well, l'm not waiting
any longer. Hmm.

803
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:03,673
Oh, sorry, Miss Oyl.

804
00:41:04,913 --> 00:41:06,039
l was philoscofying.

805
00:41:06,081 --> 00:41:07,378
Mm-hmm.

806
00:41:07,416 --> 00:41:10,385
...between us, got kind of
derailed and...

807
00:41:10,419 --> 00:41:12,353
Oh, yeah, long time waiting.

808
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:14,048
Wait a while..

809
00:41:14,089 --> 00:41:16,683
What are you doing
with that basket?

810
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:18,420
Well, l-l'm carrying it.

811
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,394
lt's your basket, ain't it?

812
00:41:20,429 --> 00:41:21,555
lt is not my basket.

813
00:41:21,597 --> 00:41:24,065
Somebody has deliberately
painted that basket

814
00:41:24,166 --> 00:41:25,497
to look like my basket.

815
00:41:25,534 --> 00:41:27,365
My basket was clean
and beautiful

816
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:28,801
and this basket is ugly.

817
00:41:28,837 --> 00:41:30,532
-Rattlesnake!
-Miss Oyl, we should at least

818
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:31,903
have dinner first,
or something.

819
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,964
Rattlesnake!
Rattlesnake!

820
00:41:33,008 --> 00:41:34,407
Oh, rattlesnake!
Ooh! Oh, oh, oh!

821
00:41:34,443 --> 00:41:36,172
Rattlesnakes?
Where is it, Miss Oyl?

822
00:41:36,211 --> 00:41:36,768
Where is it?

823
00:41:36,812 --> 00:41:37,938
Oh, oh, rattlesnake, oh!

824
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,072
Don't worry, Miss Oyl,

825
00:41:39,114 --> 00:41:40,240
l've handled vermins before.

826
00:41:40,282 --> 00:41:42,216
l'll rattle that snakes
so it's a pair of shoes.

827
00:41:42,251 --> 00:41:43,240
Rattlesnake!
Rattlesnake!

828
00:41:43,285 --> 00:41:44,650
l'll rattle that...

829
00:41:44,686 --> 00:41:47,018
-l'll rattle him upside-down.

Me son's gonna be a man

-You're bats.
-Oh, yeah?

l found him in Sweethaven.
That is why he's me Swee'pea.

1031

-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm, yeah.

1034
00:49:37,952 --> 00:49:39,510
Well, Swee'pea is
about the worst name

l ever heard on a baby.

1036
00:49:40,655 --> 00:49:42,714
Well, what do you want me
to call him? Baby Oyl?

1037
00:49:45,393 --> 00:49:47,953
Excuse me.

What could happen to me?

1041
00:50:19,894 --> 00:50:21,987
Well, l could get killed.

1042
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:24,521
lt'd be worth getting killed
to help Mom and Pop.

1043
00:50:24,565 --> 00:50:26,465
What if l won?

1044
00:50:26,501 --> 00:50:27,763
l'm fast, l'm foxy.

1045
00:50:27,802 --> 00:50:30,293
He could have a heart attack.

1046
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:48,883
Sweet Sweethaven

1047
00:50:50,725 --> 00:50:54,559

taking me to a fight

1050
00:50:57,799 --> 00:50:59,096
and my parents to a fight

1051
00:50:59,133 --> 00:51:00,395
and my baby to a fight.

1052

Ah, Sweethaven...

1053

Oh, fights are not fun.

1055
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:17,615
Know the words
for this song, Cole?

1056
00:51:17,652 --> 00:51:19,119
Of course l know the words.

1057
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:20,881
lt's our national anthem,
isn't it?

1058
00:51:20,922 --> 00:51:22,082
Pardon us...

1059
00:51:22,123 --> 00:51:23,920
Ah-ah-ah.
That'll be 62 cents--

1060
00:51:23,958 --> 00:51:26,256
going-to-an-illegal-
sporting-event tax.

1061
00:51:26,294 --> 00:51:28,728
lf it's illegal,
how come it's going on?

1062
00:51:30,932 --> 00:51:33,594
Ladies and gentlemen!

1063

Be careful...

1066

Ooh, watch that step.

1067
00:51:42,577 --> 00:51:43,839
Wait a minute.

1068
00:51:43,878 --> 00:51:45,846
They're having a lover's quarrel
in front of us.

1069
00:51:47,248 --> 00:51:49,842
That unworthiest
of worthies...

1070
00:51:49,884 --> 00:51:51,249

Now, look at that.

1074
00:51:58,025 --> 00:51:59,083
Wait a minute.

00:51:59,127 --> 00:52:02,392
Yeah... right there,

1076
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:03,397
Castor!

1077
00:52:03,431 --> 00:52:04,523
Oh, my son! Castor!

1078
00:52:04,565 --> 00:52:06,430
Make a man outta yourself.

1079
00:52:06,467 --> 00:52:08,196
Mom, Pop, l'm gonna fight him.

1080
00:52:08,236 --> 00:52:09,203
Whoops.

1081
00:52:09,237 --> 00:52:10,431
Don't go!

1082
00:52:10,471 --> 00:52:11,495
Oh, it's my baby.

1083
00:52:11,539 --> 00:52:13,598
Get out--
Get my baby outta there!

1084
00:52:13,641 --> 00:52:14,938
Don't touch his feet!

1085
00:52:14,976 --> 00:52:17,001
He's gotta dance
with those feet.

1086
00:52:21,249 --> 00:52:23,513
Castor, we go home now.

1087
00:52:23,551 --> 00:52:24,848
Olive,
do something about this.

1088
00:52:24,886 --> 00:52:25,853
What are you, a nut?

1089
00:52:25,887 --> 00:52:26,945
What good are you, Olive?

1090
00:52:26,988 --> 00:52:28,956
You get in there and get your
brother out of this!

1091
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:30,287
l can't stand
much more of this.

1092
00:52:30,324 --> 00:52:32,121
Where are my pills?

1093
00:52:32,193 --> 00:52:33,217
Don't do this!

1094
00:52:33,261 --> 00:52:35,126
Mr. Geezil,
get him outta there, Geezil!

1095
00:52:35,229 --> 00:52:37,060
Gentlemen, you know the rules:

1096
00:52:37,098 --> 00:52:38,224
There are no rules.

1097
00:52:38,266 --> 00:52:40,166
This is a fight to the finish.

1098
00:52:42,303 --> 00:52:43,861
First man who is dead, loses.

1099
00:52:43,905 --> 00:52:45,270
Good luck to both of you.

1100
00:52:45,306 --> 00:52:46,773
Did you see what he was doing?!

1101
00:52:46,808 --> 00:52:48,435
-You didn't see?!
-Good luck to you.

1102
00:52:48,476 --> 00:52:49,443
l hate you to pieces!

1103
00:52:49,477 --> 00:52:50,739
All right, come over here.

1104
00:52:50,778 --> 00:52:52,643
Now don't, don't kill him.

1105
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,375
Just fluff him up a bit.

1106
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:01,187
You'll be leading
with the left hand.

1107
00:53:01,222 --> 00:53:04,214
Castor! Castor,
get outta there!

1108
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,687
Go for him, right away, son.

1109
00:53:07,728 --> 00:53:09,161
Come on, Castor.

1110

1112
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:26,808
Come on, hit him,

1113
00:53:26,848 --> 00:53:28,110
Hang him!

1114
00:53:28,149 --> 00:53:29,446
Come on, Castor.

1115
00:53:29,483 --> 00:53:30,973
Come on, knock him.

1116
00:53:32,687 --> 00:53:34,052
Oh!

Your name's Castor,

1120
00:53:42,196 --> 00:53:43,629
Come on, sting that whale!

1121
00:53:43,664 --> 00:53:45,461
Don't make him mad, Castor.

1122
00:53:47,668 --> 00:53:48,828
He's not a person!

1123

00:53:53,674 --> 00:53:55,608
Kick him!

1126
00:53:57,078 --> 00:53:58,409

00:54:07,188 --> 00:54:08,382
One, two, three...

Oh, you'll be murdered.

1145
00:54:56,637 --> 00:54:59,697
All right, gentlemen,

00:55:01,409 --> 00:55:03,809
Touch gloves
and come out fighting.

1148
00:55:03,844 --> 00:55:04,811
What are you afraid of?

1149

1159
00:55:23,764 --> 00:55:25,698

1160
00:55:25,733 --> 00:55:27,564
Give him a karate chop!

1161
00:55:38,779 --> 00:55:40,110
Very good.

1162
00:55:40,181 --> 00:55:42,115
Fist... that's fighting.

1163
00:55:42,183 --> 00:55:43,377
You can take him!

1164
00:55:51,125 --> 00:55:52,422
Don't you dare!

1165
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:53,791
-Hey, your mudder's here?

1169
00:55:59,533 --> 00:56:00,522
You see?

1170
00:56:00,568 --> 00:56:02,866
You're letting his
mother's be distracting you.

1171
00:56:02,903 --> 00:56:04,063
Not be doing that.

He's got my eyes.
He's got your mouth.

lt's a soup burger.

1239
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:55,355
These are difficult times.

1240
01:00:55,395 --> 01:00:56,623
Burgers can't be choosers.

1241
01:00:56,663 --> 01:00:57,789
Phooey.

1242

Work is what is making
the heart grow stronger. Come.

01:01:00,968 --> 01:01:02,230
Open wide.

Bye, Mom.

01:01:03,303 --> 01:01:04,998
Ow!

1246
01:01:05,038 --> 01:01:06,733
Worry, worry, worry.

1247
01:01:08,575 --> 01:01:09,701
Now... there!

1248
01:01:09,743 --> 01:01:11,802
Well, hope the taxes
don't come to too much.

1249
01:01:11,845 --> 01:01:15,542
Oh, the main thing is
that you're all right.

1250
01:01:15,582 --> 01:01:17,880
Yeah.

1251
01:01:17,918 --> 01:01:19,112
Well, were you worried

1252
01:01:19,186 --> 01:01:22,417
that l might have gotten killed
or something, maybe, yeah?

1253
01:01:22,456 --> 01:01:23,616
Oh, Popeye, don't be silly.

1254
01:01:23,657 --> 01:01:24,988
l knew.

1255
01:01:25,025 --> 01:01:27,619
Oh, you... you didn't
have no confidenkce.

1256
01:01:27,661 --> 01:01:28,787
Oh, l did, too.

1257
01:01:28,829 --> 01:01:29,887
Mm-hmm, yeah.

1258
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:30,988
l did, too.

1259
01:01:31,031 --> 01:01:32,123
After l asked Swee'pea.

1260
01:01:32,165 --> 01:01:33,291
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1261
01:01:33,333 --> 01:01:34,459
That's rich.

1262
01:01:34,501 --> 01:01:36,731
Oh, you're gone now.
You're really a dizzy dame.

1263
01:01:36,770 --> 01:01:37,998
Oh, l asked Swee'pea,

1264
01:01:38,038 --> 01:01:39,130
and he told me.

1265
01:01:39,239 --> 01:01:40,501
lsn't that so?

1266
01:01:45,646 --> 01:01:47,580
What's this here?

1267
01:01:47,614 --> 01:01:49,639
See, l asked Swee'pea,

1268
01:01:49,683 --> 01:01:52,550
''Swee'pea,
will Popeye be killed?''

1269
01:01:52,586 --> 01:01:54,053
-Uh-uh.
-No?

1270
01:01:54,087 --> 01:01:57,386
So then l asked,

1271
01:01:57,424 --> 01:02:00,723
''Swee'pea, will Popeye
be seriously maimed?''

1272
01:02:02,429 --> 01:02:03,657
No?

1273
01:02:05,198 --> 01:02:06,096
That's two for two.

1274
01:02:06,199 --> 01:02:07,996
That could happen
to anybody, ya know.

1275
01:02:08,035 --> 01:02:11,835
So then l queried, ''Swee'pea,

1276
01:02:11,872 --> 01:02:14,067
will Popeye actually survive?''

1277
01:02:15,976 --> 01:02:17,705
Yeah, l survived.
Yeah, yeah.

1278
01:02:17,744 --> 01:02:19,336
''What? You mean he'll win?''

1279
01:02:20,547 --> 01:02:21,775
Oh!

1280
01:02:21,815 --> 01:02:23,407
That's-that's a neat trick.

1281
01:02:23,450 --> 01:02:26,977
Oh-ho, me infant
is a psychic of profiks.

1282
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:28,817
lf l didn't see it
with me own eye,

1283
01:02:28,855 --> 01:02:30,083
l wouldn't believe it.

1284
01:02:30,123 --> 01:02:32,114
That kid's a regular forecaster.

1285
01:02:32,159 --> 01:02:34,992
Remind me to ask him
about gold futures.

1286
01:02:35,028 --> 01:02:38,520
More interested in talking to
him about immediate futures.

1287
01:02:38,565 --> 01:02:39,532
Uh, Popeye?

1288
01:02:39,566 --> 01:02:40,692
Yeah?

1289
01:02:40,734 --> 01:02:42,224
He's an adorable
little fellow.

1290
01:02:42,269 --> 01:02:44,134
And he's a psychic, too.
Ain't that the truth.

1291
01:02:44,171 --> 01:02:45,866
But he looks
a little peaked to me.

1292
01:02:45,906 --> 01:02:48,374
He needs some air.

1293
01:02:48,408 --> 01:02:51,502
Air? That's all
we have here is air.

1294
01:02:51,545 --> 01:02:53,137
With your permission, Popeye,

1295
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:54,807
l'll... take him
for a little walk.

1296
01:02:54,848 --> 01:02:55,815
Well, Wimpy, why not?

1297
01:02:55,849 --> 01:02:57,248
l mean, you're like his uncle.

1298
01:02:57,284 --> 01:02:58,410
You're his Uncle Wimp.

1299
01:02:59,486 --> 01:03:00,783
Yeah, that's it.

1300
01:03:00,821 --> 01:03:01,879
Come along.

1301
01:03:01,922 --> 01:03:03,253
Hey, don't forget
his little hat here.

1302
01:03:03,290 --> 01:03:04,257
Don't forget his hat.

1303
01:03:04,291 --> 01:03:05,258
He's going out in uniform.

1304
01:03:05,292 --> 01:03:06,259
Oh, of course.

1305
01:03:06,293 --> 01:03:07,260
There you go.

1306
01:03:07,294 --> 01:03:08,261
Thank you.

1307
01:03:08,295 --> 01:03:09,284
Ain't that something?

1308
01:03:09,329 --> 01:03:10,353
He's taking him for a walk.

1309
01:03:10,397 --> 01:03:11,386
Hey!

1310
01:03:11,431 --> 01:03:12,557
Hey, wait a minute there.

1311
01:03:12,599 --> 01:03:13,930
You trying to pull a fask one?

1312
01:03:13,967 --> 01:03:14,934
He can't walks yet.

1313
01:03:14,968 --> 01:03:16,230
Oh, l'll carry him.

1314
01:03:16,269 --> 01:03:18,066
Oh, in that case,
it's all right then.

1315
01:03:18,105 --> 01:03:20,437
As long as you take him
for a drags or something.

1316
01:03:20,474 --> 01:03:22,101
Hey, l want to carry him
for a walk.

1317
01:03:22,142 --> 01:03:23,336
Oh, leave him be there, Olive.

1318
01:03:23,377 --> 01:03:25,902
lt's Uncle Wimps
going with the Swee'pea.

1319
01:03:25,946 --> 01:03:28,380
Oh, yeah, Wimpy can take
him but l can't? Hmm.

1320
01:03:28,415 --> 01:03:29,848
Well, um...

1321
01:03:29,883 --> 01:03:31,851
wh-who says you can't?

1322
01:03:31,885 --> 01:03:33,614
You said l can't. Hmm.

1323
01:03:33,653 --> 01:03:36,121
Oh. Well, um...

1324
01:03:36,189 --> 01:03:37,918
that was before.

1325
01:03:37,958 --> 01:03:39,949
Before what?

1326
01:03:39,993 --> 01:03:42,621
Well, um...

1327
01:03:42,662 --> 01:03:47,793
before l... l knew
you was worried about me.

1328
01:03:47,834 --> 01:03:49,734
Oh!

1329
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:50,794
Oh.

1330
01:03:50,837 --> 01:03:53,067
You mean, now l can carry him

1331
01:03:53,106 --> 01:03:55,506
just because
l was worried about you?

1332
01:03:55,542 --> 01:03:57,066
Yes. Yes, mm-hmm.

1333
01:03:57,110 --> 01:03:59,544
Phooey.

1334
01:03:59,579 --> 01:04:00,739
Phooey?

1335
01:04:00,781 --> 01:04:02,180
Mm.

1336
01:04:02,215 --> 01:04:03,705
Y-You said ''phooey'' to me?

1337
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:06,617
l said ''phooey''
and l mean ''phooey.''

1338
01:04:06,653 --> 01:04:07,881
Phooey.

1339
01:04:12,025 --> 01:04:13,652
She said ''phooey'' to me.

1340
01:04:13,693 --> 01:04:15,422
She said...

1341
01:04:15,462 --> 01:04:17,726
''phooey'' to me.

1342
01:04:25,138 --> 01:04:27,106
We have Lickety Split,
number one.

1343
01:04:27,174 --> 01:04:29,404
Number three, Sandcrab.

1344
01:04:29,443 --> 01:04:30,535
How 'bout six?

1345
01:04:31,645 --> 01:04:32,703
Everything's going
to be all right.

1346
01:04:32,746 --> 01:04:33,804
Now, he's with
his Uncle Wimps,

1347
01:04:33,847 --> 01:04:35,439
and they've only been gone
for a couple of hours.

1348
01:04:35,482 --> 01:04:36,449
Yeah, couple of hours.

1349
01:04:36,483 --> 01:04:37,780
Ooh, wait a minute.

1350
01:04:37,818 --> 01:04:39,308
This town could have been
built in a couple of hours.

1351
01:04:39,352 --> 01:04:40,478
Whoo!

1352
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,454
Oh, got to be trustworthy.
Wimps is trustworthy.

1353
01:04:42,489 --> 01:04:44,787
Wait a minute, l don't trust him
as far as l can throw him.

1354
01:04:44,825 --> 01:04:46,122
Throw him?
l can't even lift him.

1355
01:04:46,159 --> 01:04:47,319
l don't see them anywhere.

1356
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:49,692
Well, maybe they went
to the Rough House.

1357
01:04:49,729 --> 01:04:51,492
No, Wimpy's barred
from the Rough House.

1358
01:04:51,531 --> 01:04:52,498
-Bad credit.
-Right.

1359
01:04:52,532 --> 01:04:55,092
Oh, my stars and horses!

1360
01:04:55,135 --> 01:04:56,932
Derby day?

1361
01:04:56,970 --> 01:04:58,665
That rat Wimpy.

1362
01:04:58,705 --> 01:05:00,172
What's this got to do
with me Swee'pea?

1363
01:05:00,207 --> 01:05:01,572
They've gone to the races.

1364
01:05:01,608 --> 01:05:03,337
A baby at the horse races.

1365
01:05:03,376 --> 01:05:04,809
Where is these races?

1366
01:05:04,845 --> 01:05:06,472
Come on. Let's go.

1367
01:05:12,886 --> 01:05:15,912
Come on! Come on!

1368
01:05:24,364 --> 01:05:26,389
Oh!

1369
01:05:38,211 --> 01:05:39,576
And the winner is...

1370
01:05:39,613 --> 01:05:41,581
Cat's Pajamas.

1371
01:05:41,615 --> 01:05:42,741
Yippee!

1372
01:05:42,782 --> 01:05:44,579
We've done it.

1373
01:05:44,618 --> 01:05:46,108
Oh, that Wimps.

1374
01:05:46,186 --> 01:05:48,245
Abducticating me Swee'pea there.

1375
01:05:48,288 --> 01:05:50,313
Oh, a race track
ain't no nurskery.

1376
01:05:50,357 --> 01:05:52,587
Oh, patience, patience.

1377
01:05:52,626 --> 01:05:53,593
Got to remain calm.

1378
01:05:53,627 --> 01:05:54,958
That's it.

1379
01:05:54,995 --> 01:05:56,121
Straight ahead.

1380
01:05:59,633 --> 01:06:01,100
Lonesome, chubby?

1381
01:06:07,607 --> 01:06:08,767
We've got it. Look.

1382
01:06:08,808 --> 01:06:10,605
The Wax Doors and Gardeners?

1383
01:06:10,644 --> 01:06:13,169
No. Number two, Ed.

1384
01:06:13,213 --> 01:06:14,202
Ed?

1385
01:06:14,247 --> 01:06:15,612
That's a horse.

1386
01:06:15,649 --> 01:06:18,641
All right...
number six, Holy Moly.

1387
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:21,451
You like Holy Moly?

1388
01:06:21,488 --> 01:06:22,614
Holy Moly?

1389
01:06:22,656 --> 01:06:24,351
Holy Moly.

1390
01:06:24,391 --> 01:06:25,756
That's it, Holy Moly.

1391
01:06:25,792 --> 01:06:26,986
We can't lose.

1392
01:06:27,027 --> 01:06:29,052
Everything on Holy Moly.

1393
01:06:40,674 --> 01:06:41,800

01:07:01,928 --> 01:07:03,054
Oh, what is this?

1401
01:07:03,096 --> 01:07:04,393
A house of ill repukes?

1402
01:07:04,431 --> 01:07:09,061
Ooh, who'd bring me infant
to this den of immoraliky?

1403
01:07:09,135 --> 01:07:11,228
Don't touch nothin'. You might
get a venerable disease.

1404
01:07:11,271 --> 01:07:12,670
Oh. Ooh. Ooh!

1405
01:07:12,706 --> 01:07:14,731
ls that a bed pole you got
in your pocket, handsome?

1406
01:07:14,774 --> 01:07:16,969
Hello. Better grab me loins up
for this one.

1407
01:07:17,010 --> 01:07:18,443
Read your paper, Cole.

1408
01:07:20,814 --> 01:07:22,577
Will you...?

1409
01:07:22,616 --> 01:07:25,278
You know, if Mom caught me
in here she'd kill me.

1410
01:07:25,318 --> 01:07:27,081
There's Mom.

1411
01:07:27,187 --> 01:07:28,711
Where is that Wimpy?

1412
01:07:31,124 --> 01:07:32,318
Oh!

-There he is.

1418
01:07:44,471 --> 01:07:45,438
Wimpy, l'm disgustapated.

1419
01:07:45,472 --> 01:07:47,099
May l borrow the infant
for just a moment here?

1420
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:48,300
Oh, well, yes,
for just a moment.

1421
01:07:48,341 --> 01:07:49,638
l don't want
your little sweet peepers

1422
01:07:49,676 --> 01:07:50,768
to see what's about to happen.

1423
01:07:50,810 --> 01:07:52,277
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

1424
01:07:52,312 --> 01:07:54,576
l ought to bust you
right in the mush.

1425
01:07:54,614 --> 01:07:56,411
Yeah, what is this?

You won 120 simoleons?

1428
01:08:00,086 --> 01:08:01,610
You know how many hamburgers
that is?

1429
01:08:01,655 --> 01:08:02,917
Put your eye
where your ear is.

1430
01:08:02,956 --> 01:08:04,048
Disgraceful.
How many races?

1431
01:08:04,157 --> 01:08:05,317
Two races.

1432
01:08:05,358 --> 01:08:07,292
Hmm, let me see
that racing form.

1433
01:08:07,327 --> 01:08:09,227
Oh, maybe we can...

01:08:09,262 --> 01:08:10,957
Oh, Swee'pea?
We, oh... oh, now...

1435
01:08:10,997 --> 01:08:12,328
Wait, no.
No child of mine

1436
01:08:12,365 --> 01:08:13,662

a raceking kout.

1437
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:14,667

What are you doing there?

1441
01:08:22,442 --> 01:08:23,909
No childs of mine
will be exploiticated

1442
01:08:23,943 --> 01:08:24,910

Yeah, that's true.

1444
01:08:25,945 --> 01:08:27,378
You're going to be
a president one day.

1445
01:08:27,414 --> 01:08:28,972
lt is not ill-gotten,
it's good-gotten gains.

1446

These gains with cloth us
and feed us and save us.

1447
01:08:30,784 --> 01:08:32,581
Wrong is wrong even
when it helps you.

1448
01:08:32,619 --> 01:08:33,711
The horses are at the gate.

1449
01:08:33,753 --> 01:08:37,189
Oh, family is more important
than dumb morality, hmm.

1450
01:08:37,223 --> 01:08:39,350
Oh, look, he's got

01:08:58,778 --> 01:09:00,336

01:09:08,221 --> 01:09:10,212
Some kind of judge or lawyers?

Maybe not, but l knows
what law suitks me.

01:09:45,925 --> 01:09:48,450
Top to me bottoms
from the bottoms to me top

1481
01:09:48,495 --> 01:09:51,089
That's the way it is
till the day that l drop

1482
01:09:51,131 --> 01:09:53,599
What am l?

1483
01:09:53,633 --> 01:09:55,828
l yam what l yam

1484
01:09:57,470 --> 01:09:59,370
l yam what l yam

1485
01:09:59,405 --> 01:10:01,100
Here he comes.
Come on, Sucking Lemon.

1486
01:10:01,141 --> 01:10:02,108
What l yam, what l yam

1487
01:10:02,142 --> 01:10:03,404
Oh, come on, get up there. Ooh!

1488
01:10:03,443 --> 01:10:04,569
Wondered about meself.

1489
01:10:04,611 --> 01:10:06,636
To be or not to be--
who's axskin'?

1490
01:10:06,679 --> 01:10:09,773
l can open up an ockean,
l can take a lot of sail

1491
01:10:09,816 --> 01:10:13,217
l can lose a lot of waters,
and l'll never have to bail

1492
01:10:13,253 --> 01:10:15,483
On the coast of Madagascar,
grab a whale by the tail

1493
01:10:15,522 --> 01:10:16,489
Boy, let's go get it.

1494
01:10:16,523 --> 01:10:17,785
What am l?

1495
01:10:17,824 --> 01:10:19,951
What am l?

1496
01:10:19,993 --> 01:10:21,290
l yam what l yam!

1497
01:10:21,327 --> 01:10:24,125
l'm Popeye, the sailor

1498
01:10:24,230 --> 01:10:26,960
l'm Popeye, the sailor

1499
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,468
l'm Popeye, the sailor

1500
01:10:29,502 --> 01:10:32,130
l yam what l yam,
and that's all that l yam

1501
01:10:32,172 --> 01:10:34,970
l yam what l yam
what l yam what l yam

1502
01:10:35,008 --> 01:10:37,442
l'm Popeye, the sailor man.

1503
01:10:37,477 --> 01:10:38,808
Ha-ha!

1504
01:10:38,845 --> 01:10:42,110
Whoo, hoo-hoo!

1505
01:10:45,185 --> 01:10:47,619
Arms, don't fail me now.

1506
01:10:59,032 --> 01:11:02,297
l am what l am
and that's all that l am

1507
01:11:02,335 --> 01:11:05,031
l'm Popeye, the sailor man.

1508
01:11:06,306 --> 01:11:10,800
Whoo, hoo-hoo!

1509
01:11:30,830 --> 01:11:33,094
Whoo, hoo-hoo!

1510
01:11:37,232 --> 01:11:38,893
Oh, l hate to do this,
Swee'pea,

1511
01:11:38,933 --> 01:11:40,730
but it's neskessary.

1512
01:11:40,769 --> 01:11:42,964
Sometimes you got to do things
you don't want to do

1513
01:11:43,004 --> 01:11:44,335
when you got to do 'em, but...

1514
01:11:44,372 --> 01:11:45,498
Oh, it's cruel, Mr. Eye...

1515
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:47,508
lt may not make sense now
but maybe later.

1516
01:11:47,542 --> 01:11:49,169
...uh, Mr. Pop...
um, Mr. Popeye.

1517
01:11:49,210 --> 01:11:50,700
l'm sorry, Mrs. Oyl,

1518
01:11:50,745 --> 01:11:53,680
but it's parenk's duty
to protect me adopticated son

1519
01:11:53,715 --> 01:11:54,682
from child abusk.

1520
01:11:54,716 --> 01:11:56,183
Oh, oh, but think of Olive.

1521
01:11:56,217 --> 01:11:59,983
You can't take the poor baby
away from poor Olive.

1522
01:12:00,021 --> 01:12:01,318
Me moraliky ain't bilge,
Mrs. Oyl.

1523
01:12:01,356 --> 01:12:03,017
Me mind is set,
and when me mind is set,

1524
01:12:03,057 --> 01:12:04,888
l don't think from nothin'.

1525
01:12:04,926 --> 01:12:05,915
You sure about that?

1526
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,086
Yeah, l think so, yes.

1527
01:12:09,664 --> 01:12:11,291
Maybe we owe him an apology.

1528
01:12:11,332 --> 01:12:13,994
We'll find another place
to plant ourselves. Yeah.

1529
01:12:15,170 --> 01:12:16,364
Me, l'll check you, okay?

1530
01:12:16,404 --> 01:12:18,736
Yeah, you all right there?
This ain't bad, is it?

1531
01:12:18,773 --> 01:12:20,638
lt ain't the Ritz,
but at least you get

1532
01:12:20,675 --> 01:12:22,267
a little womb service here, huh?

1533
01:12:23,745 --> 01:12:25,440
lt ain't no palatkial
mansion either,

1534
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:26,469
but we got something.

1535
01:12:26,514 --> 01:12:28,482
Best l ever saw.

1536
01:12:28,516 --> 01:12:29,813
lt's got your blankets here.

1537
01:12:29,851 --> 01:12:30,977
Yeah, there we goes.

1538
01:12:31,019 --> 01:12:31,986
Got your blankets.

1539
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:33,044
Here we go.

1540
01:12:33,087 --> 01:12:34,782
You moved out of the Oyl's?

1541
01:12:34,823 --> 01:12:36,313
None of your business.

1542
01:12:36,357 --> 01:12:37,790
$4.25, moving out tax.

1543
01:12:37,826 --> 01:12:40,659
Nuts to you,
and nuts to your taxes.

1544
01:12:40,695 --> 01:12:41,821
You moved in here?

1545
01:12:41,863 --> 01:12:42,989
What's it look like?

1546
01:12:43,031 --> 01:12:44,157
$5.25, moving-in tax.

1547
01:12:44,232 --> 01:12:45,824
Oh, don't forget double nuts.

1548
01:12:45,867 --> 01:12:47,357
And where's this baby
come from?

1549
01:12:47,402 --> 01:12:48,869
Oh, this pelican's
brought him.

1550
01:12:48,903 --> 01:12:51,963
89 cents--
unlicensed baby tax.

1551
01:12:52,006 --> 01:12:54,065
Oh, get out of here!

1552
01:12:54,108 --> 01:12:55,075
Don't take me personal.

1553
01:12:55,109 --> 01:12:55,939
Hey, oh-oh, oh, no!

1554
01:13:08,523 --> 01:13:13,722
Hoop... hoop... hoopla!

1555
01:13:13,761 --> 01:13:15,126
Did ya see that,
what he did?

1556
01:13:15,163 --> 01:13:16,926
A whole lot of peoples.

1557
01:13:23,838 --> 01:13:25,601
Oh, thank you.

1558
01:13:33,181 --> 01:13:34,773
Go tax the fishes!

1559
01:14:09,484 --> 01:14:12,783
Swee'pea? Swee'pea? Swee'pea?

1560
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:15,789
Where's Swee'pea?

1561
01:14:15,823 --> 01:14:17,654
Swee'pea!

1562
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:22,793
Where's Swee'pea?!

1563
01:14:22,830 --> 01:14:24,889
Swee'pea!

1564
01:14:24,933 --> 01:14:29,427
Swee'pea!

1565
01:15:00,134 --> 01:15:04,764
lt's me own fault
Swee'pea's been kidnapped.

1566
01:15:04,806 --> 01:15:06,740
Olives was right.

1567
01:15:06,774 --> 01:15:11,939
Even an orphan needs
a mudder and a fadder.

1568
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:13,504
Oh..

1569
01:15:13,548 --> 01:15:15,516
lf l was going to
be Swee'pea's mudder,

1570
01:15:15,550 --> 01:15:17,950
l should have at least
let her be his fadder.

1571
01:15:17,986 --> 01:15:20,614
Ovisk ovisk.

1572
01:15:20,655 --> 01:15:21,815
Oh...

1573
01:15:21,856 --> 01:15:25,622
l ain't man enough
to be a mudder.

1574
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:29,460
And all at once l knew,
l knew at once

1575
01:15:29,497 --> 01:15:32,989
l knew he needed me

1576
01:15:37,171 --> 01:15:43,838
Until the day l die, l won't
know why l knew he needed me

1577
01:15:48,349 --> 01:15:50,442
lt could be fantasy

1578
01:15:50,485 --> 01:15:54,649
Oh-oh

1579
01:15:54,689 --> 01:15:58,455
Or maybe it's because

1580
01:15:58,493 --> 01:16:03,260
He needs me, he needs me,
he needs me, he needs me

1581
01:16:03,297 --> 01:16:06,630
He needs me, he needs me

1582
01:16:11,305 --> 01:16:18,404
Da-da, da, da, da, da,
da-da, da-da, da

1583
01:16:19,847 --> 01:16:22,782
lt's like a dime a dance,
l'll take a chance

1584
01:16:22,817 --> 01:16:26,480
l will because he needs me

1585
01:16:31,325 --> 01:16:34,453
No one ever asked before,
before

1586
01:16:34,495 --> 01:16:37,396
Because
they never needed me...

1587
01:16:37,432 --> 01:16:40,026
But l do.

1588
01:16:40,068 --> 01:16:42,798
But he does!

1589
01:16:42,837 --> 01:16:47,968
Maybe it's because
he's so alone

1590
01:16:48,009 --> 01:16:53,811
Maybe it's because
he's never had a home

1591
01:16:53,848 --> 01:16:57,511
He needs me, he needs me,
he needs me, he needs me

1592
01:16:57,552 --> 01:17:01,283
He needs me, he needs me

1593
01:17:04,292 --> 01:17:06,920
For once, for once in life

1594
01:17:06,961 --> 01:17:11,261
l finally felt
that someone needed me

1595
01:17:16,471 --> 01:17:21,773
And if it turns out real

1596
01:17:21,809 --> 01:17:26,439
Then love can turn the wheel

1597
01:17:26,481 --> 01:17:28,949
Because he needs me,
he needs me

1598
01:17:28,983 --> 01:17:34,182
He needs me, he needs me,
he needs me, he needs me

1599
01:17:39,694 --> 01:17:45,132
Da-da, da, da, da, da,
da-da, da-da, dum

1600
01:17:45,166 --> 01:17:52,663
Da-da, da, da, da, da,
da-da, da-da, da.

1601
01:18:37,318 --> 01:18:39,809
Bye-bye.

1602
01:18:43,524 --> 01:18:46,118
Dear...

1603
01:18:46,194 --> 01:18:48,253
Swee'peas.

1604
01:18:48,296 --> 01:18:51,788
Everybody's gotta have
somebodys

1605
01:18:51,833 --> 01:18:54,631
Even if it's only mes

1606
01:18:54,669 --> 01:18:57,399
Stops yer cryin', Swee'peas

1607
01:18:57,438 --> 01:19:00,236
And try to go to sleeps

01:19:00,274 --> 01:19:03,732

1609
01:19:03,778 --> 01:19:06,747
l don't knows if you cares

1610
01:19:06,781 --> 01:19:09,579
You could've come
from Heavens

1611
01:19:09,617 --> 01:19:12,586
Or a typhoon anywhere

1612
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:18,923
Well, me, l came from Heaven
of Cuddly Na-La Lagoon

1613
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:25,092
And l was told me mammy
gave me up in a typhoon

1614
01:19:25,132 --> 01:19:27,965
Well, don't you cry,
little Swee'pea

1615
01:19:28,002 --> 01:19:31,438
You and me,
we's both the same

1616
01:19:31,472 --> 01:19:34,100
And the biggest tear
l ever seen

1617
01:19:34,141 --> 01:19:37,599
Came in the eye
of a hurricane

1618
01:19:37,645 --> 01:19:43,311
Go to sleep, sleep, sleepy,
now tell me what you sees

1619
01:19:43,351 --> 01:19:50,154
And someday when you's older
l'll tell you's all about me.

1620
01:19:51,259 --> 01:19:53,124
''Love...

1621
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:56,152
From Popeye.''

1622
01:19:57,832 --> 01:19:59,595
Oh, oh...

1623
01:21:05,166 --> 01:21:07,930
Let me see, now...

1624
01:21:07,969 --> 01:21:09,937
''Keep out.''

1625
01:21:09,971 --> 01:21:12,804
Hmm... ''Tax shelter.''

1626
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:15,138
Uh...

1627
01:21:15,242 --> 01:21:16,709
Oh, the Commodore's boat,

1628
01:21:16,744 --> 01:21:18,769
but no Commodore, of course.

1629
01:21:31,121 --> 01:21:34,852
Aha!

1630
01:21:34,892 --> 01:21:35,916
Swee'pea's still
in Sweethaven.

1631
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:36,927
Wimpy!

1632
01:21:36,961 --> 01:21:38,929
-Who are you talking to?
-Uh, uh...

1633
01:21:38,963 --> 01:21:40,191
What did you say about Swee'pea?

1634
01:21:40,297 --> 01:21:41,457
l said nothing!

1635
01:21:41,498 --> 01:21:42,658
Oh!

There's no one home. Let's go.

Kid?

He ain't no Commodores.

1777

A hoity-toity Commodore.

1778
01:26:38,629 --> 01:26:39,755
He would never be that.

1779
01:26:39,796 --> 01:26:40,990
-Oh, a rat.
-Oh.

1780
01:26:41,031 --> 01:26:42,157
-A crook.
-Oh.

1781
01:26:42,199 --> 01:26:43,427
A kidnapper, and a Commodore.

1782

of some dizzy gaming broad.

-That's where they ain't?
-Mm-hmm.

1788
01:26:54,211 --> 01:26:55,337
Well, if that's

1789
01:26:55,379 --> 01:26:56,869
that's where l'm going
to prove that they ain't.

1790
01:26:56,914 --> 01:26:57,881
Oh, come on.
Let's do this.

1791

01:27:11,828 --> 01:27:13,591
but l've a shave
and shampoo awaiting.

1797
01:27:13,630 --> 01:27:14,790
Give 'em hell, Popeye!

1798
01:27:14,831 --> 01:27:15,798
Kick 'em in the butt.

1799
01:27:15,832 --> 01:27:17,129
You can count on me,
Mr. Popeye,

1800
01:27:17,234 --> 01:27:18,132
uh, tomorrow.

1801
01:27:18,235 --> 01:27:20,135
See l'd go with you,
but l got to lock up.

1802
01:27:20,237 --> 01:27:22,034
l just hope

1803
01:27:22,072 --> 01:27:23,937
l'd go with you, Popeye,
but l got us a cold.

1804
01:27:23,974 --> 01:27:25,236
You know l'd go with you...

1805
01:27:25,275 --> 01:27:26,572

1806
01:27:26,610 --> 01:27:27,736

01:27:27,778 --> 01:27:29,370
He's coming.
Revolution is waiting.

1808
01:27:29,413 --> 01:27:30,573
Oh, are you going?

1809
01:27:30,614 --> 01:27:31,706
Heard it's impartial.

Are you going?

1811

-Not me.

1812
01:27:40,891 --> 01:27:42,791
lf l wasn't afraid
of the water, l'd go.

1813
01:27:42,826 --> 01:27:44,020
Make 'em dance, Popeye.

1814
01:27:44,061 --> 01:27:45,926
Almost brought you
a bottle of Pepsi.

1815
01:27:45,963 --> 01:27:47,089
Clean up on 'em, Popeye.

1816
01:27:47,130 --> 01:27:48,961
Nauseating.

1817
01:27:48,999 --> 01:27:50,967
Don't worry,
l'm going with you,

1818
01:27:51,001 --> 01:27:51,968

You're casking shadows

1854
01:29:49,319 --> 01:29:50,684
Pride of the Pacifiric.

1855
01:29:50,721 --> 01:29:52,154
And father to the shark.

1856
01:29:52,222 --> 01:29:53,712
Brother to the piranhaca.

1857
01:29:53,757 --> 01:29:55,622
Cousin to the killer whale.

1858

01:30:04,935 --> 01:30:07,028
No resemblance.

1862
01:30:07,070 --> 01:30:09,334
We-we got the same
squinky eye.

1863
01:30:12,409 --> 01:30:14,877
What squinky eye?

1864

That's going to be hard
for you to see. Oh.

1865
01:30:17,247 --> 01:30:19,477
We got the same pipe, Pap.

1866
01:30:19,516 --> 01:30:22,110
You idiot,

1867
01:30:22,152 --> 01:30:24,586

Oh.

1872
01:30:33,730 --> 01:30:35,163
Oh, yes.

1873
01:30:36,666 --> 01:30:39,100
There's one way to prove

1874
01:30:39,136 --> 01:30:42,037
Pick up that can of spinach.

1875
01:30:42,072 --> 01:30:43,198
Pick it up!

1876

Yeah.

1877
01:30:46,943 --> 01:30:48,308
Now bring it over here.

1878
01:30:48,345 --> 01:30:49,539
Yeah. Yeah.

1879

Now eat it.

01:30:50,847 --> 01:30:51,973
Eat it?

1881
01:30:52,015 --> 01:30:53,141
Eat it.

1882
01:30:53,183 --> 01:30:54,309
Raw?

1883
01:30:54,351 --> 01:30:56,615
Eat it raw.

1884
01:30:57,621 --> 01:30:58,588

Eat the spinach,

1887
01:31:00,624 --> 01:31:01,648

that spinach.

1888
01:31:01,691 --> 01:31:02,817
Oh!

1889
01:31:02,859 --> 01:31:04,156
l don't want to eat
that spinach.

1890
01:31:04,227 --> 01:31:05,159
l don't want to eat...

1891
01:31:05,195 --> 01:31:06,457
Eat that spinach!

1892
01:31:06,496 --> 01:31:11,160
Oh, you disobedient brat.

1893
01:31:11,234 --> 01:31:13,327
You was disobedient
when you was two,

1894
01:31:13,370 --> 01:31:15,270
and you're still
disobedient now!

1895
01:31:15,305 --> 01:31:17,000
You wouldn't eat your spinach.

1896
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:19,031
Spinach what kept
our family strong

1897
01:31:19,075 --> 01:31:20,406
for thousands of years.

1898
01:31:20,443 --> 01:31:22,877
And what does me only
oxspring do with it?

1899
01:31:22,913 --> 01:31:24,346
He spits it up.

1900
01:31:24,381 --> 01:31:25,405
His mother ups and dies,

1901
01:31:25,448 --> 01:31:26,881
and he wouldn't eat his spinach.

1902
01:31:26,917 --> 01:31:27,906
She choked on it, Pop.

1903
01:31:27,951 --> 01:31:28,918
His poppa out of work,

1904
01:31:28,952 --> 01:31:30,385
and he wouldn't eat his spinach.

1905
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:31,512
lt wasn't my fault.

1906
01:31:31,555 --> 01:31:33,022
The whole country
in a depressigan.

1907
01:31:34,291 --> 01:31:36,020
And he wouldn't eat his spinach.

1908
01:31:36,059 --> 01:31:37,356
That was Coolidge, Poppa.

1909
01:31:37,394 --> 01:31:38,622
His poppa going hungry.

1910
01:31:38,662 --> 01:31:39,720
Going off to steal.

1911
01:31:39,763 --> 01:31:40,889
Stealing what?

1912
01:31:40,931 --> 01:31:42,364
Spinach.

1913
01:31:42,399 --> 01:31:46,392
So his ungrate son
could grow up big and strong.

1914
01:31:46,436 --> 01:31:47,528
You know what l done?

1915
01:31:47,571 --> 01:31:50,039
You know what l done
when the G man catched me

1916
01:31:50,073 --> 01:31:51,199

1917
01:31:51,308 --> 01:31:52,434

-l laughed.
-Yeah. You laughed?

1919
01:31:53,810 --> 01:31:55,437
l laughed a whole year.

1920
01:31:59,082 --> 01:32:01,050
Cut me down
from this yardarm.

1921
01:32:01,084 --> 01:32:02,711
Getting away with that rotten
little insect

1922
01:32:02,752 --> 01:32:03,719
of a stool pigeon.

1923
01:32:03,753 --> 01:32:04,720
Cut you down?

1924
01:32:04,754 --> 01:32:05,743
Cut me down!

Cut me down.

1926
01:32:06,790 --> 01:32:07,984

Well, you said cut you down.

1931

lf you do,
l'll make you eat it.

1939
01:32:35,285 --> 01:32:37,879
You'll be known as

That's me pap.

All hands on deck.

1959
01:33:18,662 --> 01:33:21,130
Help, Popeye!

1960
01:33:21,164 --> 01:33:23,496
The wharf, the wharf is moving.

1961
01:33:23,533 --> 01:33:24,932
Shut up, stupid.

1962
01:33:24,968 --> 01:33:26,094
This ain't no wharf.

1963
01:33:26,136 --> 01:33:27,535
This is me getaway boat.

1964
01:33:27,570 --> 01:33:28,901

Hoist the main mast.

1966
01:33:42,185 --> 01:33:44,016
Hurry up, Popeye!

1967
01:33:44,054 --> 01:33:46,181
You're falling behind!

1968
01:33:46,289 --> 01:33:49,053
And Bluto's getting away!

1969
01:33:49,092 --> 01:33:50,491

1970
01:33:50,527 --> 01:33:54,293
Help!

1971
01:33:56,532 --> 01:33:59,126
What is it?

1972
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:01,136
lt's a rock.

1973
01:34:01,170 --> 01:34:03,400
lt's a hard place.

1974
01:34:03,439 --> 01:34:05,873
Oh, no. lt's Scab lsland.

1975
01:34:05,908 --> 01:34:07,000
Mom...

1976
01:34:07,043 --> 01:34:08,738
Don't worry, Castor.

1977
01:34:08,778 --> 01:34:10,871
Your father's with us.

1978
01:34:10,913 --> 01:34:14,974
S-S-S... Scab lsland!

01:34:15,017 --> 01:34:16,075
Haul ass!

1980
01:34:16,119 --> 01:34:17,143
Haul ass, haul ass.

01:34:17,253 --> 01:34:18,447
Get to your stations.

1982
01:34:18,488 --> 01:34:20,149
Get to your battle stations.

1983
01:34:20,189 --> 01:34:24,091
Oh... oh, phooey!

1984
01:34:25,895 --> 01:34:27,920
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1985
01:34:27,964 --> 01:34:30,023
Who do you think you are,
Captain Arab?

1986
01:34:30,066 --> 01:34:32,159
l'm trying to save
me Olive Oyl and me Swee'peas.

1987
01:34:32,201 --> 01:34:33,896
Olive Oyl? Swee'pea?

1988
01:34:33,936 --> 01:34:36,302
What are you doing,

1989
01:34:36,339 --> 01:34:38,637

01:34:43,212 --> 01:34:45,112
Oh, yeah? Well,

ls that any way to talk
to your fadder?

1997
01:34:50,086 --> 01:34:51,451
You ain't me fadder.

1998
01:34:51,487 --> 01:34:52,647
Me fadder was tall and kind

1999
01:34:52,688 --> 01:34:54,019
and looks like
Abraham Lincoln.

2000
01:34:54,056 --> 01:34:56,024
Yeah, don't tell me what l am.

2001
01:34:56,058 --> 01:34:57,855
Eh? Where'd he go,
where'd he go?

2002
01:34:57,894 --> 01:34:59,122
l says l am your fadder.

2003
01:34:59,228 --> 01:35:02,129
l ought to know whose fadder
l is and whose fadder l ain't.

2004
01:35:02,231 --> 01:35:03,289
Who says?

2005
01:35:03,332 --> 01:35:05,391
l said. l said.

2006
01:35:05,434 --> 01:35:08,130
l says avast, you bilge rat,
before l use you as an anchor.

2007
01:35:08,171 --> 01:35:10,298
Bilge rat, bilge rat,
bilge rat?!

2008
01:35:10,339 --> 01:35:11,465
Mutiny, mutiny!

2009
01:35:11,507 --> 01:35:13,498
l am your one and only fadder.

2010
01:35:13,543 --> 01:35:14,635
Look it, look it--

2011
01:35:14,677 --> 01:35:16,872
Eh...
the same bulgy arms.

2012
01:35:16,913 --> 01:35:18,039
No resemblance.

2013
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:20,378
Eh, the same squinky eye, eh?

2014
01:35:20,416 --> 01:35:21,383
What squinky eye?

2015
01:35:21,417 --> 01:35:22,384
The squinky eye.

2016
01:35:22,418 --> 01:35:25,148
Help, Popeye! Oh!

2017
01:35:25,254 --> 01:35:28,883
We even got, we even
got the same pipe. Look!

2018
01:35:30,359 --> 01:35:31,621
This ain't me pipe.

2019
01:35:33,196 --> 01:35:34,424
He took the bait.

2020
01:35:34,463 --> 01:35:38,126
Eh, l've never seen anything
like this before in me life.

2021
01:35:38,167 --> 01:35:40,658
Talking to your
poor old fadder like that.

2022
01:35:40,703 --> 01:35:42,261
You disobedient brat.

2023
01:35:42,305 --> 01:35:45,172
You're spoiled--
that's what you are-- spoiled.

2024
01:35:45,208 --> 01:35:48,939
Children. Children. Kids.

2025
01:35:48,978 --> 01:35:51,071
Eh, phooey!

2026
01:35:51,113 --> 01:35:52,102
Phooey!

2027
01:35:52,148 --> 01:35:55,049
Give them everything they want,

2028
01:35:55,084 --> 01:35:56,312
and what'd you get in return?

2029
01:35:56,352 --> 01:35:59,116
Nothing, nothing.

2030
01:35:59,155 --> 01:36:00,622
Nothing but heartache,

2031
01:36:00,656 --> 01:36:02,749
heartache, sadness,
and miserky.

2032
01:36:02,792 --> 01:36:04,316
And a bad time,
once in a while,

2033
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:06,385
when you try to give them a
bath, and they don't want it.

2034
01:36:06,429 --> 01:36:08,226
And another bad time
when you want to do something

2035
01:36:08,264 --> 01:36:10,129
that you really want to do,
but all they want to do

2036
01:36:10,166 --> 01:36:11,292
is not what you want to do.

2037
01:36:11,334 --> 01:36:12,926
Bless their little hearts.

2038
01:36:12,969 --> 01:36:15,233
lf they were
really made out of gold,

2039
01:36:15,271 --> 01:36:16,932
l'd like to sell them
on the open marketplace.

2040
01:36:16,973 --> 01:36:18,907
l could make me a fortune.

2041
01:36:18,941 --> 01:36:20,272
l could've made us a fortune.
Kids!

2042
01:36:20,309 --> 01:36:24,575
Eh, they don't
know what they're doing.

2043
01:36:24,614 --> 01:36:27,139
Kids, dadblast 'em!

2044
01:36:27,183 --> 01:36:28,480
They're gonna lead you
to ruin.

2045
01:36:28,517 --> 01:36:30,781
That's what they gonna do.
Lead you to ruin.

2046
01:36:30,820 --> 01:36:32,651
They cry at you
when they're young,

2047
01:36:32,688 --> 01:36:34,121
they yell at you
when they're older,

2048
01:36:34,156 --> 01:36:36,351
they borrow from yous
when they're middle-aged,

2049
01:36:36,392 --> 01:36:38,019
and they leave you alone
to die...

2050
01:36:38,060 --> 01:36:39,584
without even paying you back!

2051
01:36:39,629 --> 01:36:42,723
Children. Phooey!

2052
01:36:44,133 --> 01:36:45,395
You give them
everything they want,

2053
01:36:45,434 --> 01:36:47,095
and what do you
get back in return?

2054
01:36:47,136 --> 01:36:48,398
You gets nothing!

2055
01:36:48,437 --> 01:36:50,735
Catch him like
a big, fat lobster.

2056
01:36:50,773 --> 01:36:53,037
Why, they're just smaller
versions of us, you know.

2057
01:36:53,075 --> 01:36:55,407
Well, l'm not so crazy
about me in the first place.

2058
01:36:55,444 --> 01:36:57,002
So why do l want
one of them?

2059
01:36:57,046 --> 01:36:59,844
l'm asking you.
Children.

2060
01:36:59,882 --> 01:37:03,443
Ah, children.
Little children.

2061
01:37:03,486 --> 01:37:04,953
You'll pour
your heart out to them,

2062
01:37:04,987 --> 01:37:06,477
you give them
everything they want,

2063
01:37:06,522 --> 01:37:08,046
give them candy,
and a lot of toys,

2064
01:37:08,090 --> 01:37:09,114
and what do you get back?

2065
01:37:09,158 --> 01:37:10,284
You get a lot of noise.

2066
01:37:10,326 --> 01:37:12,123
Nah-nah-nah-nah, nah, nah.

2067
01:37:12,161 --> 01:37:13,788
My poppa's a mean old man!

2068
01:37:17,099 --> 01:37:19,499
l'm through with children.
l'm through with kids.

2069
01:37:19,535 --> 01:37:23,062
There ain't nothing
l'm never gonna do about it.

2070
01:37:23,105 --> 01:37:25,505
There it is, Pap,
we's got 'em cornered.

2071
01:37:29,278 --> 01:37:32,509
Dad blast
that dirty bilge rat!

2072
01:37:32,548 --> 01:37:33,981
You! You,

2073
01:37:34,016 --> 01:37:35,244

2074
01:37:35,284 --> 01:37:36,478
Come up here.

2075
01:37:36,519 --> 01:37:37,486
Get up here, get up here.

2076
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:41,081
Help! Oh! Help me!

2077
01:37:41,123 --> 01:37:42,750
There she is!

2078
01:37:42,792 --> 01:37:44,089
Haul ass, haul ass.

2079
01:37:44,126 --> 01:37:45,650
Get the cannon
and move it here.

2080
01:37:45,695 --> 01:37:48,892
Come on, haul ass,
haul ass, haul ass.

2081
01:37:48,931 --> 01:37:51,491
Get the cannon
and move it here.

2082
01:37:51,534 --> 01:37:52,831
ln a good position, that's it.

2083
01:37:52,868 --> 01:37:54,165
What are you doing?

2084
01:37:54,270 --> 01:37:55,362
You can't fire that thing.

2085
01:37:55,404 --> 01:37:57,031
There's women and infants
on that boat.

2086
01:37:57,073 --> 01:37:58,040
You stop worrying.

2087
01:37:58,074 --> 01:38:01,271
All l'm gonna do
is fire a warning shot

2088
01:38:01,310 --> 01:38:02,436
right across the bow.

2089
01:38:02,478 --> 01:38:04,878
Don't you thinks
l knows what l'm doing?

2090
01:38:07,550 --> 01:38:09,245
Ah, short, short.

2091
01:38:09,285 --> 01:38:10,718
l was a little short.

2092
01:38:10,753 --> 01:38:12,118
A little short?

2093
01:38:12,221 --> 01:38:13,347
Reload it, reload it.
Reload it.

2094
01:38:13,389 --> 01:38:14,378
No, you don't.

2095
01:38:19,895 --> 01:38:22,090
Dadblast it! l missed!

01:38:23,766 --> 01:38:26,394
Full speed ahead.

2097
01:38:26,435 --> 01:38:28,232
Slow down, Pap,
so we can board her.

2098
01:38:28,270 --> 01:38:29,567
We're not gonna board her.

2099
01:38:29,605 --> 01:38:31,698
l'm gonna ram him.
l'm gonna ram him.

2100
01:38:31,741 --> 01:38:34,369
He's not going to get away
with my treasure.

2101

Me Olive and me Swee'pea

2102
01:39:08,811 --> 01:39:12,008
Ha, ha. Pirate's Cove.

2103
01:39:12,048 --> 01:39:13,709
l should've known it.

2104
01:39:13,749 --> 01:39:17,082
All right, Mr. Mean.

2105
01:39:17,119 --> 01:39:19,781
Oh, 'cause that's gonna be your
name

2106
01:39:19,822 --> 01:39:21,483
from this day forward!

2107
01:39:21,524 --> 01:39:24,084
Yeah, well, you've
broken your bail of straws

2108
01:39:24,126 --> 01:39:26,390
on this camel's back,
and just to think

2109
01:39:26,429 --> 01:39:28,989
that l was ever gonna get
engaged to you again!

2110
01:39:29,031 --> 01:39:30,862
Oh, nevermore, l say.

2111
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:32,595
Nevermore!

2112
01:39:32,635 --> 01:39:34,296
Get the water out of the boat!

2113
01:39:34,336 --> 01:39:36,327
Lower the lifeboats.
All women first.

2114
01:39:36,372 --> 01:39:38,306
Get the water out of the boat!

2115
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:39,807
Portly men first!

2116
01:39:48,818 --> 01:39:50,877
Oh, shit!

2117
01:39:54,723 --> 01:39:59,922
