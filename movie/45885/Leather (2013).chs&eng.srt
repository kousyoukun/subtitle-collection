我只知道他帮助了我。

我觉得这很难想象。

这不是我想象的你的房间。

只有我爸爸和我。

我是他唯一在世的亲戚。

220
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,320
但我想流浪。

221
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,660
我开着卡车到处转悠。

我把它叫做流浪者和骗子快车。

我不知道你对这个感兴趣。

沃尔特看起来很奇怪。
Walt looked funny.

243
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:58,280
就感觉他一夜之间瘦了二十磅

244
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:01,490
他的皮肤是黄色的。

我奶奶以前总是玩这个!

252
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:42,080
你介意我们说话的时候把那个关掉吗?

253
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,640
他想联系你…

但他说你恨他。
but he said you hated him.

255
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,160
听着，伙计，我觉得这一切都很奇怪。
Look, man, I feel really strange about all of this.

Andrew said he was a hoarder, but this place is pretty tidy.

257

258
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:19,600
整面墙，从地板到天花板，都是报纸。
That entire wall, from the floor to the ceiling, was newspapers.

259

这里简直就是场灾难。

囤积物品是他抑郁的一部分。

你爸爸是个可悲的人。

难过什么?
Sad about what?

269
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:53,200
悲伤不需要感情和敏感性吗?
Doesn't it take feelings, sensitivity to be sad?

270
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,210
兄弟,你是痛苦的。
Man, you're bitter.

271
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,680
不，我是个快乐的人
No, I'm a happy person,

272
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,610
并且是因为他已经离开了我的生活。
and that's because he's out of my life.

273
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:11,460
他失去了他最爱的妻子。

然后他把儿子赶走了。

275
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,020
它破坏了他…

276
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,760
一段时间。
for a while.

277
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,660
然后他继续自己的生活。
Then he got on with his life.

278
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,800
那是你跳过课的时候吗?
Is that when you skipped in?

279
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,800
我的状况也很糟糕。

这很有趣…
That's interesting...

283
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,890
这么说你成了那个孝顺的代理儿子?
So you became the dutiful surrogate son?

284
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,160
我叫安德鲁和他爸爸和好。
I told Andrew to patch things up with his dad.

285

我爸爸很刻薄，不风趣，不支持我。
My dad was mean-- not fun, not supportive.

427

伯奇出于自卫杀死了他。

他为了房子和车间杀了我爸爸？

00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:38,310
是来揍我的吗?
Come to punch me out?

567
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:41,380
很好。让我们做它。
Fine. Let's do it.

568
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,380
我就预感到你会来。
I had a hunch you'd be here.

569
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:53,880
你以为我对这些石头有感情，因为
You think I have a sentimental attachment to these rocks 'cause

570
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,660
500年前我们曾在这里宿营?
we used to camp here five-hundred years ago?

571
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,900
我想我比想象中更了解你。
I guess I know you better than I thought.

572
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,940
那个木偶戏真是恶心又变态。
That puppet show was really sick and twisted.

573
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:09,380
似乎是个好主意。
Seemed like a good idea.

574
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:11,280
但我猜不是。
But I guess not.

575
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:17,960
生存主义者的阻力是什么？
What's with the survivalist drag?

576
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,660
阻力吗?
Drag?

577
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:25,290
假装自己是林肯时代的先驱。
Pretending to be some pioneer from the time of Lincoln.

578
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:27,620
我没有假装什么。
I'm not pretending anything.

579
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:30,560
我只是按照自己喜欢的方式生活。
I just live the way I like.

580
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:35,840
如果你喜欢喝茶，现在就告诉我。
If you're a tea-bagger, just tell me now.

581
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:37,760
我真的很想知道。
I'd really like to know.

582
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:41,540
我很惊讶你在你的床上没有
I'm surprised you don't have a poster of Sarah Palin

583
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:42,860
莎拉·佩林的海报
over your bed.

584
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:47,100
你完全误会我了，安迪。
You've got me all wrong, Andy.

585
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,600
别那样叫我。
Don't call me that.

586
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,660
我叫安德鲁。
My name is Andrew.

587
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,720
你知道莎拉·佩林是谁吗?
Do you even know who Sarah Palin is?

588
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:06,580
你知道互联网是什么吧?
You do know what the internet is, right?

589
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:10,340
我看到了，但是…
I've seen it, but...

590
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:12,460
我不需要它。
I don't need it.

591
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:19,060
是的，我很熟悉那个泼妇。
And yeah, I am familiar with that fishwife.

592
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:22,580
泼妇吗?
Fishwife?

593
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:30,260
我最近在什么地方看到过这个词。
Saw that word somewhere recently.

594
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:38,440
亨利·詹姆斯常说泼妇。
Henry James says fishwife a lot.

595
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:41,070
你读过詹姆斯?
You've read James?

596
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:44,920
我只读了麦茜知道的东西。
I've only read What Maisie Knew.

597
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:50,280
我对疯狂的家庭很感兴趣。
Crazy families interest me.

598
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,000
并不令人惊讶。
Not surprising.

599
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:05,640
能像人们以前那样集中注意力一定很好。
Must be nice to concentrate the way people used to.

600
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,180
我的大脑的腐坏。
My brain's addled.

601
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:12,680
我不能专注。
I can't focus.

602
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:17,020
但你拿到了博士学位。
But you're getting a doctorate.

603
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,280
我吃安德拉(一种药品)。
I take Adderall.

604
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,040
那是什么?
What's that?

605
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,400
这是他们为注意力缺陷症
It's a type of speed they prescribe

606
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,400
开出的药
for attention deficit disorder.

607
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:33,320
这很有意义。
That makes a lot of sense.

608
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,920
在我的世界里确实如此。
It does in my world.

609
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,980
那是什么?
What is that shit?

610
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,120
这个吗?
This?

611
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,820
哈维的神奇药品。
Harvey's Wonder Tonic.

612
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:30,810
(乐观的民间音乐)
[upbeat folk music]

613
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:42,060
幻影离开了我，离开了我，留下了我一个人
¶ Left me, left me, left me all alone

614
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:45,890
你在电话里叫我哭泣
¶ Then you call me cryin' on the phone

615
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:55,670
幻影离开了我，离开了我，离开了我自己
¶ Left me, left me, left me on my own

616
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:59,810
你不知道你把我的心变成了石头吗
¶ Don't you know you turn my heart to stone

617
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:25,370
别做个胆小鬼。
Don't be a milksop.

618
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,540
进来。
Come in.

619
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:42,580
现在，下坡，这次该轮到谁了?
¶ Hey now, go down, whose turn is it this time?

620
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:47,750
行了吧，你愿意做我的阳光吗
¶ Hey now, go 'round, won't you be my sunshine

621
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:55,290
好吧，我不知道你要去哪里
¶ Well I don't know where you are going

622
00:55:55,330 --> 00:56:00,470
而我不关心你去过哪里
¶ and I don't care where you've been

623
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:05,270
我们在阳光下分享了这一时刻，
¶ We've shared this moment in the sunlight,

624
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:11,550
也许我们还会再见面
¶ and maybe we will meet again

625
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:21,760
我称你为我的朋友，也称你为我的爱人
¶ I've called you my friend, and I've called you my lover

626
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:25,690
尽管我们的时代可能很快就要结束了
¶ And though our time might soon be over

627
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:28,290
你怎么还穿着那个?
Why are you still wearing those?

628
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:35,940
好吧，现在，走吧，这次该轮到谁了?
¶ Well hey now, go down, whose turn is it this time?

629
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,440
如果我得不到我的工作，我就完蛋了。
If I don't get my job back I'm screwed.

630
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,780
但是为什么你不能得到别的东西呢?
But why can't you get something else?

631
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:54,020
我搞砸了，如果杂志不让我回来
I screwed up, and if the magazine won't have me back,

632
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:57,820
时尚界再也没有人会相信我了。
no one in the fashion world will trust me again.

633
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,860
搞砸了?
Screwed up?

634
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:02,820
哦!
Oh!

635
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:04,790
我喜欢跳恰恰舞。
I love cha-cha.

636
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:09,060
更喜欢满不在乎。
More liked fucked-up.

637
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:11,230
在拍摄。
At a shoot.

638
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:15,940
我偷了设计师的衣服。
I stole some clothes from a designer.

639
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:19,860
大概值2万美元。
Like twenty-thousand dollars worth.

640
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:23,000
哦。
Oops.

641
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:27,040
完全正确。
Exactly.

642
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:37,620
你听过“跳出框框思考”这句话吗?
Have you ever heard that phrase, Think Outside the Box?

643
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:40,160
当然可以。
Of course.

644
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,430
这是令人厌倦的陈词滥调。
It's called a tired cliché .

645
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:45,800
但这确实是陈词滥调。
But it's a true cliché.

646
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:52,770
作为一名治疗师，我也接受过提供职业建议的培训，
Look, as a therapist I'm also trained to give career advice,

647
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:57,780
你要做的是意外。
and what you've got to do is the unexpected.

648
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:04,100
衣服，杂志，这是我活着的目的。
Clothes, magazines, it's what I live for.

649
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,920
不要做奴隶。
Don't be a slave.

650
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,360
创办自己的杂志。
Start your own magazine.

651
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,640
听起来不错。
That sounds great and all.

652
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:21,320
但这是原则问题。
But it's the principle of the thing.

653
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,570
我把衣服退了。
I gave the clothes back.

654
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:28,780
那天我吃了一片阿普唑仑，不知道是怎么回事。
I took a Xanax that day and I don't know what came over me.

655
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:38,750
你的童年是怎样的，凯尔?
What kind of childhood did you have, Kyle?

656
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:41,490
童年是禁区。
Childhood is off limits.

657
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:46,130
这是可怕的。
It was terrible.

658
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:51,260
但我已经把我生命的那一部分裹在了钢丝上，梅，
But I've wrapped that part of my life up in a steel wool, May,

659
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:55,000
我把它放在垃圾处理机里了。
and I put it down the garbage disposal.

660
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:59,210
我的话。
My word.

661
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:03,040
那么，到底发生了什么?
So, what exactly happened?

662
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:06,880
什么也没有发生。
Nothing happened.

663
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:09,320
我不懂。
I don't follow.

664
01:00:18,430 --> 01:00:22,980
可能是卢埃拉告诉我海蒂，那是我的
That was probably Luella telling me that Hedy--that's my

665
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:26,530
老板——他明天会打电话来把我的工作还给我。
boss--will be calling tomorrow to give me my job back.

666
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:29,300
因为她需要我。
Because she needs me.

667
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:33,610
我很有天赋，May。
I have a lot of talent, May.

668
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:36,100
我相信你。
I believe you.

669
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,180
我现在真的很狼狈。
I'm shit-faced.

670
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,640
我要清醒。
I'm getting sober.

671
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:49,780
我得把木偶戏拿回家去。
I gotta get that puppet theater back home.

672
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:51,990
安德鲁在哪儿?
Where's Andrew?

673
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,500
我真的很担心。
I'm really worried.

674
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:59,040
我想他现在就在这里！
I want him here now!

675
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:40,820
可能,可能!
May, May!

676
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:46,900
我该怎么办呢?(这里我听不清楚，求原谅)
How could I will do ?

677
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:48,600
哦,我的上帝。
Oh my God.

678
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,500
May，该起床了。
May, it's time to get up.

679
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:51,280
我在哪儿?
Where am I?

680
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:54,020
在安德鲁家——伯奇家。
At Andrew's house - Birch's.

681
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:56,740
我出去找他们，但我吓坏了。
I went out looking for them, but I got scared.

682
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:59,320
不用担心这两个。
Don't worry about those two.

683
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:01,860
他们又没准备好露营。
It's not like they're prepared to camp.

684
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:03,960
他们可能会死在那里。
They could die out there.

685
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,660
伯奇吗?不可能的。
Birch? Impossible.

686
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:11,960
伯奇像是树林里的树，污垢或者蝾螈一样，
That kid takes to the woods like, like, I don't know, trees,

687
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,880
他们会没事的
dirt, and newts.

688
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,480
我们甚至不知道他们是否在一起。
We don't even know if they're together.

689
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:23,040
再喝点酒。
Have some more wine.

690
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:28,140
今天是卡茨基尔山脉的独立日。
It's Independence Day in the Catskill Mountains.

691
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,980
也许这对你有用。
Maybe that might work for you.

692
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:35,680
但这种情况可能是生死攸关的
But this situation is potentially life or death.

693
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:42,300
在这里，在树林里消磨时间很正常。
Around here it's fine and normal to pass time in the woods.

694
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:45,500
波奇会照顾你的男朋友的。
Birch'll look out for your boyfriend.

695
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:56,880
“你穿着红色的袍子，真是个美丽的少女
"YOU ARE SUCH A MAIDEN FAIR ALL IN YOUR ROBES OF RED WILL YOU

696
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:02,820
把我抱在你的怀里，让我睡在你的床上?”
TAKE ME IN YOUR ARMS AND HAVE ME IN YOUR BED?"

697
01:04:02,850 --> 01:04:09,000
“走吧，走吧，煤铁匠，你说的不对
"AWAY, AWAY YOU COAL BLACKSMITH WHAT YOU DO SAY IS WRONG DOST

698
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,260
你以为像我这样的姑娘只唱一首歌就能到手吗?"
THOU THINK A LASS LIKE ME CAN BE HAD FOR JUST A SONG?"

699
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:17,720
耶户说、等著、夫人等著。
AND HE SAID, "BIDE, LADY BIDE.

700
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:20,970
你对我的欲望没有隐藏。
YOUR LUST FOR ME DON'T HIDE.

701
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:29,680
这位精力充沛的史密斯先生将成为你的爱人，并摧毁你的骄傲。”
THIS LUSTY SMITH WILL BE YOUR LOVE AND POUND AWAY YOUR PRIDE."

702
01:04:55,660 --> 01:05:07,860
在这个古老的故事里，我们有一个叫奥古斯特·奥里萨巴的人
In this old tale we have a man named August Orizaba who carried

703
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:11,860
他口袋里有十磅金条。
ten pounds of gold bullion in his pockets.

704
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:18,560
他沿街走着，衣服松垂得很滑稽。
His clothes sagged funny as he walked down the street.

705
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:26,860
这是1849年在塔希提岛。
This was in Tahiti in the year 1849.

706
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:36,540
奥古斯特走进一家酒馆，在那里他遇见了赫尔曼·梅尔维尔。
August walked into a saloon where he met Herman Melville.

707
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:45,880
他们像跳着草裙舞的女孩一样吃着鱼，喝酒想要
They ate fish and drank all night as hula girls tried to

708
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:48,540
引起他们的注意。
catch their attention.

709
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:57,580
但这两个人都被对方吸引住了。
But the two men were fascinated by each other.

710
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:09,520
当他们喝得酩酊大醉时，奥古斯特拿出一些金子
When they were good and drunk, August took out some gold and

711
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,120
付了钱。
paid the tab.

712
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:19,880
他们走到外面一个美丽的丛林里。
They walked outside into a beautiful jungle.

713
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:33,000
奥古斯特想吻赫尔曼·梅尔维尔，但梅尔维尔却
August tried to kiss Herman Melville, but Melville was

714
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:38,360
犹豫了一下，道了晚安。
hesitant and said good-night.

715
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:52,020
你不尊重我是谁，也不尊重我的工作。
You don't respect who I am or what I do.

716
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:53,380
闭嘴,凯尔。
Shut up, Kyle.

717
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:55,480
你这么贫穷。
You're so needy.

718
01:06:57,260 --> 01:06:59,480
你觉得我很肤浅。
You think I'm superficial.

719
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:03,060
你总是这么说，安德鲁。
You say it all the time, Andrew.

720
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:11,780
你们95%的人都是可爱的，令人惊叹的。
Ninety-five percent of you is loving and amazing.

721
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:17,560
剩下的5%，也就是你的涂层，有点像(这句不知道怎么翻译)
The other five percent, your coating, is like some

722
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:20,340
Hello Kitty up-fuck。
Hello Kitty up-fuck.

723
01:07:21,550 --> 01:07:27,020
没错，我就是个卡通人物。
That's right, I'm a cartoon up-fuck.

724
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:32,000
说到性爱这件事，我为什么必须贿赂才能让你
And speaking of fucking, why do I practically have to bribe you

725
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,500
把你的鸡巴插在我身上?!
to stick your dick in me?!

726
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:48,880
我以前很讨厌夏末因为
I used to hate it when you'd go back to the Adirondacks at the

727
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,440
你要离开我回到阿迪朗达克。
end of summer.

728
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:57,360
这样一年中的其他时间，我都会很想念你。
The rest of the year I'd miss you.

729
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:09,600
晚上躺在床上入睡时，我总是想象着你和我
In bed at night, falling asleep, I used to imagine you and me

730
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:11,830
在一起冒险。
having adventures together.

731
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,520
真的吗?
Really?

732
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:18,320
你肯定会觉得很奇怪。
That must sound strange to you.

733
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:20,500
我一点也不觉得奇怪。
Not at all.

734
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:31,180
我很抱歉打了你。
Sorry about that.

735
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:35,090
疼吗?
Does it hurt?

736
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,290
不。
Nah.

737
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:09,150
(轻音乐)

738
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,460
哦,我的上帝。
Oh my God.

739
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:05,830
哦,我的上帝。
Oh my God.

740
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,800
God-fucking-dammit !
God-fucking-dammit!

741
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:33,460

749
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:07,590
哇嘿。
Whoa hey.

750
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:09,830
发生了什么事?
What happened?

751
01:13:11,830 --> 01:13:13,460
你为什么这么不高兴?
Why you so upset?

752

嘿,嘿!
Hey, Hey!

01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,570
我们只是忘了时间。
We just lost track of time.

754
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:20,920
我们在树林里摔伤了。

755
01:13:27,550 --> 01:13:30,950
告诉我你为什么这么害怕。

756

他们都走了。

757
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:47,160
我不知道他们是否还活着，也不知道他们在哪里。

哦,上帝。
Oh God.

759
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:56,020
这是我经历过的最糟糕的事情。
This is the worst thing that's ever happened to me.

760
01:14:00,850 --> 01:14:02,650
库柏会回来的。
Copper will be back.

761
01:14:04,990 --> 01:14:07,220
但兔子就不一样了。
I can't say the same for the rabbit.

762
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:12,640
(尖叫)玛丽安! !

他睡着了。
He's asleep.

764

我给了他安必恩。
I gave him an Ambien.

765
01:14:36,020 --> 01:14:37,680
难以置信的
Incredible.

766
01:14:41,180 --> 01:14:44,320
我差点儿把库珀带进了树林，但我叫他
I almost brought Copper into the woods with me, but told him to

767
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:47,320
呆在这里，保护凯尔的安全。
stay here, to keep Kyle safe.

768
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:52,820
我真的很抱歉。
I'm really sorry.

769
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:58,120
那只狗是我和沃尔特最后的联系。
That dog is my last connection to Walter.

770
01:15:00,070 --> 01:15:01,660
关于我的什么?
What about me?

771
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:05,500
我和那家伙有血缘关系。
I'm actually blood related to the guy.

772
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:18,760
凯尔确信是你杀了我爸爸。
Kyle's convinced that you killed my dad.

773
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:24,260
我为什么要那么做?
Why would I do that?

774
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,620
我不晓得。
I dunno.

775
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:30,680
这样你就可以住在这里了。
So you can live here.

776
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:34,700
你爸爸生病之前我住在这里。
I lived here before your dad got sick.

777
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,700
我没有杀他。
I didn't kill him.

778
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:41,800
我喜欢他。
I loved the guy.

779
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:47,140
凯尔也认为……
Kyle also thinks...

780
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:54,520
…他认为你和我爸爸是恋人。
...he thinks you and my dad were lovers.

781
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:56,860
你觉得怎么样?
What do you think?

782
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:12,700
我希望我们能呆在森林里。
I wish we could've just stayed in the forest.

783
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,420
你可以。
You can.

784
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:20,340
我是说你。
I mean with you.

01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:28,280
我知道我爱你，从我们还是孩子的时候。
I learned that I've loved you since we were kids.

786
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:34,400
你有男朋友了。
You've got a boyfriend.

787
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:47,860
听着，伯奇，我知道我们做爱了
Look, Birch, I know we had sex and all,

788
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:51,120
但你是同性恋吗?
But are you even gay?

789
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:55,520
我不这么想。
I don't think so.

790
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:58,200
你不知道?
You don't know?

791
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:01,140
我不确定。
I'm not sure.

792
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:05,040
不管怎样，我真的不在乎我是或不是。
Either way, I don't really care if I am or if I'm not.

793
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,640
这没有道理。
That makes no sense.

794
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:11,100
你是如何识别的?
How do you identify?

795
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:13,660
作为一个男人。
As a man.

796
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:16,270
我有条鸡鸡。
I've got a dick.

797
01:17:16,310 --> 01:17:17,460
一个脑子。
I've got a brain.

一颗心。
A heart.

799
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:19,580
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

800
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:24,000
你昨晚是同性恋。
You were gay last night.

801
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:29,760
这么说吧，对你来说，我是同性恋。
Let's put it this way, I'm gay for you.

802
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:35,240
否则，我真的不会这么想。
Otherwise, I really don't think in those terms.

803
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:39,180
我从来没有这样想过。
It doesn't even cross my mind to think that way.

804
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,560
当你打飞机的时候，你会想到男人吗?
Do you think of men when you jerk off?

805
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:45,700
会啊。
Sure.

806
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:48,020
你会想到女人吗?
Do you think about women?

807
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:49,500
噢,是的。
Oh yeah.

808
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:53,140
然后你是双性恋。
Then you're bisexual.

809
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:55,780
好吧。
Okay.

810
01:17:57,720 --> 01:17:59,160
好吧。
All right.

811
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,680
你有男朋友了，安迪。
You've got a boyfriend, Andy.

812
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:33,940
他需要你。
And he needs you.

813
01:19:31,860 --> 01:19:32,740
七喜!
Hedy!

我终于抓住你了!

谢谢。
Thanks.

821
01:20:04,710 --> 01:20:07,710
(软声音乐)
[soft acoustic music]

822
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:17,150
你打得他很重。
You hit really him hard.

823
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:18,000
手表。
Watch.

824
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:20,420
我不需要看那个。
I don't need to see that.

825
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:35,840
这是我这辈子最糟糕的宿醉。
This is the worst hangover of my life.

826
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:39,320
哦,上帝。
Oh God.

827
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:44,980
在这一点上，我真是太操心了，
At this point I'm so fucked that murdering Hedy is actually the

828
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:46,580
谋杀Hedy实际上是我能做的最好的事情。
best thing I could do.

829
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:49,800
我同意。
I agree.

830
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:52,720
非常明智的职业选择。
Very wise career move.

831
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:58,460
安德鲁，当人们不喜欢你的时候，你会很伤心。
It hurts, Andrew, it hurts bad when people don't like you.

832
01:21:59,260 --> 01:22:01,420
我很痛苦，好吧。
I'm in pain, okay.

833
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:03,700
史上最糟糕的。
The worst ever.

834
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:09,400
请振作起来。
Please try to pull yourself together.

835
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:12,260
你和那个乡巴佬过夜
You spent the night with that hick--

836
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:15,980
至少你能对我好点。
least you could do is be nice to me.

837
01:22:16,510 --> 01:22:19,140
失业会让任何人失去它。
Unemployment can make anyone lose it.

838
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:22,140
你还是关心我的，不是吗?
You still care about me, don't you?

839
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:26,180
你知道我有时就是这样的。
You know this is just how I get sometimes.

840
01:22:26,220 --> 01:22:28,320
我知道。
I know.

841
01:22:31,290 --> 01:22:34,560
但我们应该面对事实……
But we should face the facts and...

842
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:40,360
…知道玛丽安可能已经死了。
...know that Marianne is probably dead.

843
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:41,600
请。
Please.

844
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:49,780
我们应该回城里去。
We should go back to the city.

845

你不适合住在这里。

我该怎么办呢?

你必须离开那里。

做一些意想不到的。

梅是这么说的。

你可以成为一家商店的采购员。

他想要一张桌子，他就做了。

他想要凉鞋，他自己做。

你需要一份时尚方面的工作。

862
01:23:43,630 --> 01:23:45,260
让它发生。
Make it happen.

863
01:23:48,830 --> 01:23:52,600
听起来你们童子军的关系很好。
Sounds like you two Boy Scouts had a great bonding experience.

01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:13,520
我能从你的声音里听出来，安德鲁。

我能从你的眼睛里看到。

875

是的。

01:24:52,940 --> 01:24:54,180
好吗?
Well?

877

嗯什么?
Well what?

878
01:24:57,020 --> 01:24:58,460
想让我哭吗?
Want me to cry?

879
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:03,300
昨晚我为你哭泣，但你不在这里。

在星空下唱牛仔歌时

885
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:29,070
你也对他说过我爱你吗？
cowboy songs under the stars?

886
01:25:30,020 --> 01:25:32,020
就这样发生了。
It just happened.

887
01:25:43,950 --> 01:25:46,100

01:27:33,740 --> 01:27:34,960

伯奇，你的凉鞋要多少钱?

913
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:25,700

专业地卖出去?

我不时地在跳蚤市场上把它们低价卖掉。

需求并不大。
It's not like there's a high demand.

922

我有个最天才的主意!
I've got the most fucking genius idea ever!

我打算开个网站，叫“皮革”。
I'm going to start a website called, "Leather."

你觉得怎么样?

934
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:08,840
等你卖出去第一双之后我们再谈吧。
Let's talk when you make your first sale.

935

一点点的恐惧会让它更特别。
