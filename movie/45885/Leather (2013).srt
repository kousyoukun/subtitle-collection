Oh yeah?

148
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,340
I made them.

149
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,840
Kyle works in fashion.

150
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,310
Oh.

151
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,780
So, when did you
two first meet?

152
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,390
We were kids
together.

153
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:20,840
Birch spent summers with his
grandparents down the road.

154
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:24,360
You never told me
about a Birch.

155
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,420
So, when did you and
my dad become friends?

156
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:38,260
When I started working
for him five years ago.

157
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,720
Doing what?

158
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,780
Everything.

159
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,000
What's that mean?

160
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,260
Carpentry.

161
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,580
Tarring roofs.

162
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,150
Working leather.

163
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:51,460
Everything he tried
to interest me in.

164
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,160
He straightened me out.

165
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,940
He was a great man.

166
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,520
I guess you'd
know better than me.

167
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,000
All I know is he helped me.

168
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,640
I find that hard to imagine.

169
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:22,800
I haven't talked to
the man in a decade.

170
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:27,860
Some old lady calls me and
says he's been dead for weeks.

171
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:32,480
We drive up, and find that
you've been hanging with him

172
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,480
for five years.

173
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,070
Yeah.
That's about right.

174
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,570
Andrew wants to
clean the place up.

175
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:46,380
We might use it on the
weekends, or rent it out.

176
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,040
So...

177
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,560
This is not how I
pictured your room.

178
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,980
I sold everything so
I could move to the city.

179
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,380
That's all that's left.

180
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,240
So this is your house, right?

181
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,790
Of course.

182
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,390
It was just my dad and me.

183
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,400
I'm his only living relative.

184
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,060
Maybe your dad left it to him.

185
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,800
I wouldn't be surprised.

186
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,400
Birch is hot...

187
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,460
...In a Little House on
the Prairie sort of way.

188
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,260
He used to be heavy metal.

189
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,540
Supper's ready in
twenty minutes.

190
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,680
Um...

191
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,940
okay.

192
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,740
Thanks.

193
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,460
Supper?

194
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,160
This trout is incredible.

195
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,400
Did you catch it?

196
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,230
Yeah.

197
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,340
And I got the greens
down by the stream.

198
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,800
They're good, huh?

199
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,940
My dad used to take us fishing.

200
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,060
By the waterfall.

201
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,180
I still go there.

202
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,950
Damnit.

203
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,080
It keeps dropping me.

204
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,740
Try the trout.

205
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:45,800
Not to be rude, but
I don't eat seafood.

206
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,460
You eat sushi all the time.

207
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,240
Eat what you're
comfortable with.

208
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,740
This cheese is yummy.

209
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,020
I made it.

210
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,350
You make cheese?

211
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,040
Out of what?

212
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,250
Dairy products, Kyle, milk.

213
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,860
I know that, but
from what animal?

214
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,160
Beaver.

215
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,060
Beaver milk?

216
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:57,260
Mostly, with a little
coyote milk for that sharp bite.

217
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,460
He's yanking your chain.

218
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:21,040
When my grandparents died, Walt
told me if I ever needed work

219
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,820
to come see him.

220
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,320
But I wanted to roam.

221
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,660
I drove around,
living in my truck.

222
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,560
What did you do for money?

223
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:41,180
Sold off my grandparents'
stuff at flea markets.

224
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,710
Oh.

225
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,940
I went all over.

226
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,350
Vermont, Kentucky.

227
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,520
But then I
couldn't take it anymore.

228
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,920
Eating every meal
at Quick Marts.

229
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,420
People out there are crazy...

230
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,800
dangerous.

231
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:04,000
Drifters and
Grifters Express I call it.

232
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:12,540
So I came back here,
and haven't left since.

233
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,280
So...You took care of
him when he got sick?

234
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,390
Yeah.

235
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,520
You want to tell
me what happened?

236
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,900
I didn't know you
were interested.

237
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:34,070
Well I am.

238
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:36,470
Okay...

239
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:45,100
Well, we were doing a job
for the Presbyterian church.

240
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,510
Making pews.

241
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:52,640
The day we loaded the last pew
onto their flatbed truck,

242
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,650
Walt looked funny.

243
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:58,280
Like he'd lost twenty
pounds overnight,

244
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:01,490
and his skin
was yellow.

245
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:05,160
He said his belly hurt.

246
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,330
A week later he died in bed.

247
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,340
Those are his last drawings.

248
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:17,140
They were on the bed
with him when he died.

249
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,420
Oh my God

250
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:29,860
[folk music plays]

251
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:33,780
My grandma used
to play this all the time!

252
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:42,080
You mind turning
that off while we talk.

253
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,640
He wanted to
contact you...

254
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,990
but he said you
hated him.

255
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,160
Look, man, I feel really
strange about all of this.

256
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:13,070
Andrew said he was a hoarder,
but this place is pretty tidy.

257
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,500
No...

258
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:19,600
That entire wall, from the floor
to the ceiling, was newspapers.

259
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,420
It was a disaster in here.

260
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,800
It took us four months to clean.

261
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:27,550
I found reminders
of you everywhere.

262
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:30,420
Really?

263
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,120
School papers.

264
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:35,080
A Christmas list
from 1991.

265
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,860
Aw, that's so cute.

266
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,330
The hoarding was
part of his depression.

267
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:43,390
Your dad was a sad man.

268
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,400
Sad about what?

269
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:53,200
Doesn't it take feelings,
sensitivity to be sad?

270
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,210
Man, you're bitter.

271
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,680
No, I'm a
happy person,

272
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,610
and that's because
he's out of my life.

273
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:11,460
He lost the wife that he
loved more than anything.

274
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,700
Then he drove his son away.

275
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,020
It wrecked him...

276
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,760
for a while.

277
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,660
Then he got on
with his life.

278
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,800
Is that when
you skipped in?

279
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,800
I was in bad
shape, too.

280
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,320
We helped each
other out.

281
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,980
Life got better.

282
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,700
That's interesting...

283
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,890
So you became the
dutiful surrogate son?

284
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,160
I told Andrew to patch
things up with his dad.

285
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:53,660
Why didn't you even call
me, invite me to the funeral?

286
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,900
I didn't know how to
get a hold of you.

287
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,900
Have you heard of Google?

288
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:01,780
I'm listed on the NYU
grad student home page.

289
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,980
I don't do
electric mail.

290
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:11,400
Helen found
you somehow.

291
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,650
But you didn't
even try.

292
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:21,600
You know, Andy, you were a
lot nicer when we were kids.

293
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,660
What happened?

294
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,470
Kitty Wells?

295
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,870
Montana Slim?

296
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,260
Who are these people?

297
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,520
Look who's here,
buddy, it's Andrew.

298
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,880
Can you believe it?

299
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,520
How's it going up
there, flying around

300
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,360
with the hawks
and eagles.

301
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,100
By the way, the paint on
the gravestone is temporary.

302
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,040
I can't find a chisel.

303
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,470
But when I do, I'll get to work.

304
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,640
Isn't burying a body
in your yard illegal?

305
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,910
I mean, won't the
health department get mad?

306
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:19,460
We did what people've
done for thousands of years.

307
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:24,360
When that old
lady called-- Helen.

308
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:31,240
She said she didn't know what
he had, but probably cancer.

309
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,220
Yeah, we think it
was pancreatic.

310
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,620
You think?

311
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,200
What did the doctors say?

312
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,480
Your dad hated doctors.

313
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,260
No he didn't.

314
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:50,280
He changed a lot
since you left home.

315
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,180
I haven't forgotten
what an asshole he was

316
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,720
when we were kids...

317
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,600
How he treated you.

318
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,960
But he really did transform.

319
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,400
Transformed into a doctor-hater?

320
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,380
So you just let him die?

321
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,660
We prayed for him to get better.

322
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,980
What the fuck?

323
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,640
Let me guess, you
administered the chemo.

324
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,180
No.

325
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,240
Look.

326
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,470
He called up an old girlfriend.

327
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,970
A Christian
Science practitioner.

328
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,280
This is getting crazy.

329
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,810
Helen moved in and
became his nurse.

330
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,320
Spiritual nurse.

331
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,500

00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:46,130
It was terrible.

658
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:51,260
But I've wrapped that part of
my life up in a steel wool, May,

659
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:55,000
and I put it down
the garbage disposal.

660
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:59,210
My word.

661
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:03,040
So, what exactly happened?

662
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:06,880
Nothing happened.

663
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:09,320
I don't follow.

664
01:00:18,430 --> 01:00:22,980
That was probably Luella
telling me that Hedy--that's my

665
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:26,530
boss--will be calling
tomorrow to give me my job back.

666
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:29,300
Because she needs me.

667
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:33,610
I have a lot of talent, May.

668
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:36,100
I believe you.

669
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,180
I'm shit-faced.

670
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,640
I'm getting sober.

671
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:49,780
I gotta get that
puppet theater back home.

672
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:51,990
Where's Andrew?

673
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,500
I'm really worried.

674
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:59,040
I want him here now!

675
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:40,820
May, May!

676
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:46,900
Cock-a-doodle-do.

677
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:48,600
Oh my God.

678
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,500
May, it's time to get up.

679
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:51,280
Where am I?

680
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:54,020
At Andrew's house - Birch's.

681
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:56,740
I went out looking for
them, but I got scared.

682
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:59,320
Don't worry about those two.

683
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:01,860
It's not like
they're prepared to camp.

684
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:03,960
They could die out there.

685
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,660
Birch?
Impossible.

686
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:11,960
That kid takes to the woods
like, like, I dunno, trees,

687
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,880
dirt, and newts.

688
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,480
We don't even know
if they're together.

689
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:23,040
Have some more wine.

690
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:28,140
It's Independence Day in
the Catskill Mountains.

691
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,980
Maybe that might
work for you.

692
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:35,680
But this situation is
potentially life or death.

693
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:42,300
Around here it's fine and normal
to pass time in the woods.

694
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:45,500
Birch'll look out
for your boyfriend.

695
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:56,880
"YOU ARE SUCH A MAIDEN FAIR ALL
IN YOUR ROBES OF RED WILL YOU

696
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:02,820
TAKE ME IN YOUR ARMS
AND HAVE ME IN YOUR BED?"

697

"AWAY, AWAY YOU COAL BLACKSMITH

CAN BE HAD FOR JUST A SONG?"

699
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:17,720
AND HE SAID, "BIDE, LADY BIDE.

700

701
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:29,680
THIS LUSTY SMITH WILL BE YOUR
LOVE AND POUND AWAY YOUR PRIDE."

702
01:04:55,660 --> 01:05:07,860
In this old tale we have a man
named August Orizaba who carried

703
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:11,860
ten pounds of gold
bullion in his pockets.

704
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:18,560
His clothes sagged funny as
he walked down the street.

705
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:26,860
This was in Tahiti in
the year 1849.

706
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:36,540
August walked into a saloon
where he met Herman Melville.

707
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:45,880
They ate fish and drank all
night as hula girls tried to

708
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:48,540
catch their attention.

709
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:57,580
But the two men were
fascinated by each other.

710
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:09,520
When they were good and drunk,
August took out some gold and

711
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,120
paid the tab.

712
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:19,880
They walked outside
into a beautiful jungle.

713
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:33,000
August tried to kiss Herman
Melville, but Melville was

714
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:38,360
hesitant and said good-night.

715
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:52,020
You don't respect
who I am or what I do.

716
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:53,380
Shut up, Kyle.

717
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:55,480
You're so needy.

718
01:06:57,260 --> 01:06:59,480
You think I'm superficial.

719
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:03,060
You say it all the time, Andrew.

720
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:11,780
Ninety-five percent of
you is loving and amazing.

721
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:17,560
The other five percent,
your coating, is like some

722
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:20,340
Hello Kitty up-fuck.

723
01:07:21,550 --> 01:07:27,020
That's right, I'm
a cartoon up-fuck.

724
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:32,000
And speaking of fucking, why do
I practically have to bribe you

725
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,500
to stick your dick in me?!

726
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:48,880
I used to hate it when you'd go
back to the Adirondacks at the

727
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,440
end of summer.

728
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:57,360
The rest of the
year I'd miss you.

729
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:09,600
In bed at night, falling asleep,
I used to imagine you and me

730
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:11,830
having adventures together.

731
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,520
Really?

732
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:18,320
That must sound strange to you.

733
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:20,500
Not at all.

734
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:31,180
Sorry about that.

735
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:35,090
Does it hurt?

736
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,290
Nah.

What happened?

751
01:13:11,830 --> 01:13:13,460
Why you so upset?

752
01:13:13,970 --> 01:13:15,480
Hey, Hey!

753
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,570
We just lost track of time.

754
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:20,920
We crashed in the woods.

755
01:13:27,550 --> 01:13:30,950
Tell me why
you're so freaked out.

756
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:38,800
They're both gone.

757
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:47,160
I don't know if they're
alive, or where they are.

01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:50,280
Oh God.

759
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:56,020
This is the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

760
01:14:00,850 --> 01:14:02,650
Copper will be back.

761
01:14:04,990 --> 01:14:07,220
I can't say the
same for the rabbit.

He's asleep.

764
01:14:34,150 --> 01:14:36,020
I gave him an Ambien.

765
01:14:36,020 --> 01:14:37,680
Incredible.

766
01:14:41,180 --> 01:14:44,320
I almost brought Copper into the
woods with me, but told him to

767
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:47,320
stay here, to keep Kyle safe.

768
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:52,820
I'm really sorry.

769
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:58,120
That dog is my last
connection to Walter.

770
01:15:00,070 --> 01:15:01,660
What about me?

771
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:05,500
I'm actually blood
related to the guy.

772
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:18,760
Kyle's convinced
that you killed my dad.

773
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:24,260
Why would I do that?

774
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,620
I dunno.

775
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:30,680
So you can live here.

776
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:34,700
I lived here before
your dad got sick.

777
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,700
I didn't kill him.

778

I loved the guy.

779
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:47,140
Kyle also thinks...

780
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:54,520
...he thinks you and
my dad were lovers.

781

What do you think?

782
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:12,700
I wish we could've just
stayed in the forest.

783
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,420
You can.

784
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:20,340
I mean with you.

785
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:28,280
I learned that I've loved
you since we were kids.

786
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:34,400
You've got a boyfriend.

787
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:47,860
Look, Birch, I know we
had sex and all,

788
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:51,120
But are you
even gay?

789
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:55,520
I don't think so.

790
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:58,200
You don't know?

791
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:01,140
I'm not sure.

792
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:05,040
Either way, I don't really
care if I am or if I'm not.

793
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,640
That makes no sense.

794
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:11,100
How do you identify?

795
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:13,660
As a man.

796
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:16,270
I've got a dick.

797
01:17:16,310 --> 01:17:17,460
I've got a brain.

798
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:18,110

What are you talking about?

800
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:24,000
You were gay last night.

801
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:29,760
Let's put it this
way, I'm gay for you.

802
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:35,240
Otherwise, I really
don't think in those terms.

803
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:39,180
It doesn't even cross my
mind to think that way.

804
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,560
Do you think of men
when you jerk off?

805
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:45,700
Sure.

806
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:48,020
Do you think about women?

Oh yeah.

808
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:53,140
Then you're bisexual.

809
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:55,780
Okay.

810
01:17:57,720 --> 01:17:59,160
All right.

811

You've got a boyfriend, Andy.

Yeah.

No problem.

819
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:53,680
Yeah.
