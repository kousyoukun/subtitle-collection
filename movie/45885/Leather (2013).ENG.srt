1
00:04:23,195 --> 00:04:25,697
Thanks, Walt.

2
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:40,679
Thanks for everything.

3
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:39,660
<i>Morning and an Oldsmobile,
coming down the road</i>

4
00:05:39,695 --> 00:05:43,705
<i>Stars still shinin'
in the west</i>

5
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:49,740
<i>Something I should tell you
But it's nothin' that I know</i>

6
00:05:50,095 --> 00:05:54,440
<i>Baby give yourself a rest</i>

7
00:05:54,475 --> 00:05:56,897
<i>Out of danger</i>

8
00:05:56,932 --> 00:05:59,285
<i>Take your time</i>

9
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:05,320
<i>I'm no stranger but I
cannot read your mind</i>

10
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:38,680
<i>I've been untrue to promises
made in moments of love</i>

11
00:07:40,315 --> 00:07:45,107
<i>To someone like you</i>

12
00:07:45,142 --> 00:07:49,865
<i>And others like you</i>

13
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:55,900
<i>Yeah, I've been untrue
to promises made</i>

14
00:07:56,115 --> 00:07:59,957
<i>in moments of love</i>

15
00:07:59,992 --> 00:08:03,496
<i>To someone like you</i>

16
00:08:03,531 --> 00:08:07,000
<i>And others like you</i>

17
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,080
I hope you don't mind
Walter's music.

18
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:14,660
It's sad thinking of him
alone here all those years,

19
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,860
no girlfriend.

20
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,240
No one to slow dance with.

21
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:25,080
His wife was the
one true love...

22
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,860
And then she died.

23
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,460
Don't make me cry.

24
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,340
You lucky boy Copper.

25
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,983
You take good care of Birch.

26
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:44,440
Walter died happier
knowing his dog was with you.

27
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,760
Aren't you going to
try on your sandals?

28
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,430
Of course!

29
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,300
I can't believe
you fuckin' made these.

30
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:14,318
I've never worn
anything made just for me.

31
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,140
Move in with me.

32
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,640
Work on the Hudson.
It's got sturgeon, eels.

33
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,540
Toxic waste to clean up.

34
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,000
No.

35
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,240
I'm going tomorrow.

36
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:41,345
It's Idaho or bust.

37
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,280
My folks are in Florida and...

38
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,420
Other than you, I think
New York's over for me.

39
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,920
At least for a while.

40
00:09:57,195 --> 00:09:59,196
Will you write me?

41
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,740
No.

42
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,300
Not unless it's e-mail.

43
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,020
You're gonna change your
mind when you get my letters.

44
00:10:11,055 --> 00:10:13,444
Each one will be a work of art.

45
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:26,853
<i>When I stop loving you</i>

46
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:35,261
<i>When I stop loving you,
a train won't need a track</i>

47
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:41,869
<i>When I stop caring for you
to go where we come back</i>

48
00:10:42,407 --> 00:10:48,407
<i>To know that you love me Is
just the way I want it to be</i>

49
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:55,287
<i>And one and one
won't be two</i>

50
00:10:55,322 --> 00:11:01,322
<i>When I stop loving you</i>

51
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,240
It's so fucking hot I had to
tuck a bunch of Kleenex

52
00:11:41,275 --> 00:11:42,860
between my legs to
sop up the sweat.

53
00:11:42,895 --> 00:11:44,645
Stop, please...

54
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,740
My poached eggs are just meeting
up with last night's margaritas.

55
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,280
Pardon. Pardon.

56
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,700
Hey, you never called me
back about house-sitting.

57
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,980
I was dying to do it.

58
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,380
Kyle decided to
bring Marianne with us.

59
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,480
Hi Luella, you
skank, what's up?

60
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,880
On my way to have
brunch, with Ginger.

61
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,610
Who?

62
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,760
Your boss's
new assistant, darling.

63
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,360
I'll play corporate spy and find
out when she's hiring you back.

64
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,580
Didn't you hear, the
economy's getting better.

65
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,580
I hope so or else there'll be
an uprising of junior fashion

66
00:12:13,615 --> 00:12:19,020
editors sporting Hermes
Uzis and Balenciaga AK-47s.

67
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,900
I'll get the dirt
and call you tonight.

68
00:12:21,935 --> 00:12:24,440
And you better invite
me up some weekend.

69
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,990
If Marianne gets out of
the house she'll die,

70
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,580
plain and simple.

71
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,480
She'd die if Luella
was house-sitting.

72
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,525
We just have to be careful.

73
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,860
You know how devastated she
is when we go out of town.

74
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,160
It's like you have to
infantilize everything.

75
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:00,440
Turn people, animals, fucking
handbags into cute little Easter

76
00:13:00,745 --> 00:13:06,745
baskets wrapped up for some
rich bitch bobble-headed girl.

77
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,220
It's bullshit.

78
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,240
Thanks.

79
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,900
It's good to finally
know that every ounce

80
00:13:11,935 --> 00:13:13,205
of my being
is worthless.

81
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:18,820
Ninety-five percent of
you is loving, and amazing.

82
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,820
Five percent of you, your
coating, is like some

83
00:13:21,855 --> 00:13:23,560
Hello Kitty up-fuck.

84
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,940
Up-fuck?

85
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,100
What are you talking about?

86
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,340
Nothing.

87
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,500
I'm just a pretentious dick.

88
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,860
You'll love the pond.

89
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,190
Anything in there
that'll bite my toes?

90
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,560
Just me.

91
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,300
I hope that means you
have sex on the brain.

92
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,500
It's been weeks, you know.

93
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,160
Thank God.

94
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,680
Can we have picnics, too?

95
00:14:39,715 --> 00:14:41,200
Anything you want,

96
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,440
just as long as you help
me clean the house out.

97
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:50,220
Ten years ago my Dad
was a big-time hoarder.

98
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,340
Imagine it now.

99
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,490
Frankly, I'm glad I
never had to meet your dad.

100
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,660
I wish I could say the same.

101
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,990
That's pitiful.

102
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,500
Anyway, I told you to patch
things up with him before

103
00:15:05,535 --> 00:15:06,687
it was too late.

104
00:15:06,722 --> 00:15:07,840
Don't even go there.

105
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,380
Imagine how I feel?

106
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,720
Like a son who's
lost his father.

107
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,700
It's normal to feel bad.

108
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,000
Be cool with me, okay?

109
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,300
I'm walking into my past here.

110
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,240
It's heavy.

111
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,940
It's stressful.

112
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,940
Here goes nothing.

113
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,920
This is it.

114
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,740
Hey!
You can't go in there.

115
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,240
Hi.
I'm Walter's son.

116
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,660
Who are you?

117
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,830
Andy?

118
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,400
I can't believe it.

119
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,860
Birch?

120
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,520
Um...

121
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,740
Wow.

122
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,680
I'm real sorry.

123
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,100
Thanks.

124
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,440
I guess you didn't
expect to see me here.

125
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,840
No.
This is a pretty big surprise.

126
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,020
Kyle.

127
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,340
Birch.

128
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,530
We were friends as kids.

129
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,060
Oh really.

130
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,500
We had some time off.

131
00:17:20,535 --> 00:17:21,285
So it seemed...

132
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,200
He tried to contact you.

133
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:25,920
Did he?

134
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,320
I'm sorry, what's
your name again?

135
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:29,940
Birch.

136
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,120
Welcome.

137
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,550
Do you live here?

138
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,320
Yeah.

139
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,300
There's no reception here.

140
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,530
Your sandals are to die for.

141
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,000
Oh yeah?

142
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,340
I made them.

143
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,840
Kyle works in fashion.

144
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,310
Oh.

145
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,780
So, when did you
two first meet?

146
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,390
We were kids
together.

147
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:20,840
Birch spent summers with his
grandparents down the road.

148
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:24,360
You never told me
about a Birch.

149
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,420
So, when did you and
my dad become friends?

150
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:38,260
When I started working
for him five years ago.

151
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,720
Doing what?

152
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,780
Everything.

153
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,000
What's that mean?

154
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,215
Carpentry.

155
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,700
Tarring roofs.

156
00:18:47,735 --> 00:18:49,115
Working leather.

157
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:51,460
Everything he tried
to interest me in.

158
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,160
He straightened me out.

159
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,940
He was a great man.

160
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,520
I guess you'd
know better than me.

161
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,000
All I know is he helped me.

162
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,640
I find that hard to imagine.

163
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:22,800
I haven't talked to
the man in a decade.

164
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:27,860
Some old lady calls me and
says he's been dead for weeks.

165
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:32,480
We drive up, and find that
you've been hanging with him

166
00:19:32,515 --> 00:19:34,480
for five years.

167
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,070
Yeah.
That's about right.

168
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,570
Andrew wants to
clean the place up.

169
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:46,380
We might use it on the
weekends, or rent it out.

170
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,040
So...

171
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,560
This is not how I
pictured your room.

172
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,980
I sold everything so
I could move to the city.

173
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,380
That's all that's left.

174
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,240
So this is your house, right?

175
00:20:29,275 --> 00:20:30,790
Of course.

176
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,390
It was just my dad and me.

177
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,400
I'm his only living relative.

178
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,060
Maybe your dad left it to him.

179
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,800
I wouldn't be surprised.

180
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,400
Birch is hot...

181
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,460
...In a Little House on
the Prairie sort of way.

182
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,260
He used to be heavy metal.

183
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,540
Supper's ready in
twenty minutes.

184
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,680
Um...

185
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,940
okay.

186
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,740
Thanks.

187
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,460
Supper?

188
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,160
This trout is incredible.

189
00:21:14,195 --> 00:21:15,400
Did you catch it?

190
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,230
Yeah.

191
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,340
And I got the greens
down by the stream.

192
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,800
They're good, huh?

193
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,940
My dad used to take us fishing.

194
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,060
By the waterfall.

195
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,180
I still go there.

196
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,950
Damnit.

197
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,080
It keeps dropping me.

198
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,740
Try the trout.

199
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:45,800
Not to be rude, but
I don't eat seafood.

200
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,460
You eat sushi all the time.

201
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,240
Eat what you're
comfortable with.

202
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,740
This cheese is yummy.

203
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,020
I made it.

204
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,350
You make cheese?

205
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,040
Out of what?

206
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,215
Dairy products, Kyle, milk.

207
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,860
I know that, but
from what animal?

208
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,160
Beaver.

209
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,060
Beaver milk?

210
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:57,260
Mostly, with a little
coyote milk for that sharp bite.

211
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,460
He's yanking your chain.

212
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:21,040
When my grandparents died, Walt
told me if I ever needed work

213
00:23:21,075 --> 00:23:22,820
to come see him.

214
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,320
But I wanted to roam.

215
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,660
I drove around,
living in my truck.

216
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,560
What did you do for money?

217
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:41,180
Sold off my grandparents'
stuff at flea markets.

218
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,710
Oh.

219
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,435
I went all over.

220
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,350
Vermont, Kentucky.

221
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,520
But then I
couldn't take it anymore.

222
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,920
Eating every meal
at Quick Marts.

223
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,420
People out there are crazy...

224
00:23:58,455 --> 00:23:59,800
dangerous.

225
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:04,000
Drifters and
Grifters Express I call it.

226
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:11,070
So I came back here,
and haven't left since.

227
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,280
So...You took care of
him when he got sick?

228
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,390
Yeah.

229
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,520
You want to tell
me what happened?

230
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,900
I didn't know you
were interested.

231
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:34,070
Well I am.

232
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:36,470
Okay...

233
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:45,100
Well, we were doing a job
for the Presbyterian church.

234
00:24:45,135 --> 00:24:46,510
Making pews.

235
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:52,640
The day we loaded the last pew
onto their flatbed truck,

236
00:24:52,675 --> 00:24:54,650
Walt looked funny.

237
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:58,280
Like he'd lost twenty
pounds overnight,

238
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:01,490
and his skin
was yellow.

239
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:05,160
He said his belly hurt.

240
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,330
A week later he died in bed.

241
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,305
Those are his last drawings.

242
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:17,140
They were on the bed
with him when he died.

243
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,420
Oh my God

244
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:33,780
My grandma used
to play this all the time!

245
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:42,080
You mind turning
that off while we talk.

246
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,605
He wanted to
contact you...

247
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,990
but he said you
hated him.

248
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,125
Look, man, I feel really
strange about all of this.

249
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:13,070
Andrew said he was a hoarder,
but this place is pretty tidy.

250
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,500
No...

251
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:19,600
That entire wall, from the floor
to the ceiling, was newspapers.

252
00:26:19,635 --> 00:26:21,385
It was a disaster in here.

253
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,800
It took us four months to clean.

254
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:27,550
I found reminders
of you everywhere.

255
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:30,420
Really?

256
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,120
School papers.

257
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:35,080
A Christmas list
from 1991.

258
00:26:35,115 --> 00:26:36,860
Aw, that's so cute.

259
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,330
The hoarding was
part of his depression.

260
00:26:41,365 --> 00:26:43,390
Your dad was a sad man.

261
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,400
Sad about what?

262
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:53,200
Doesn't it take feelings,
sensitivity to be sad?

263
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,210
Man, you're bitter.

264
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,645
No, I'm a
happy person,

265
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,610
and that's because
he's out of my life.

266
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:11,460
He lost the wife that he
loved more than anything.

267
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,700
Then he drove his son away.

268
00:27:13,735 --> 00:27:15,020
It wrecked him...

269
00:27:15,055 --> 00:27:16,760
for a while.

270
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,660
Then he got on
with his life.

271
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,800
Is that when
you skipped in?

272
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,230
I was in bad
shape, too.

273
00:27:26,265 --> 00:27:28,320
We helped each
other out.

274
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,980
Life got better.

275
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,700
That's interesting...

276
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,890
So you became the
dutiful surrogate son?

277
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,160
I told Andrew to patch
things up with his dad.

278
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:53,660
Why didn't you even call
me, invite me to the funeral?

279
00:27:53,695 --> 00:27:55,900
I didn't know how to
get a hold of you.

280
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,900
Have you heard of Google?

281
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:01,780
I'm listed on the NYU
grad student home page.

282
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,980
I don't do
electric mail.

283
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:11,400
Helen found
you somehow.

284
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,650
But you didn't
even try.

285
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:21,600
You know, Andy, you were a
lot nicer when we were kids.

286
00:28:21,635 --> 00:28:22,660
What happened?

287
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,470
Kitty Wells?

288
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,870
Montana Slim?

289
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,260
Who are these people?

290
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,520
Look who's here,
buddy, it's Andrew.

291
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,880
Can you believe it?

292
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,520
How's it going up
there, flying around

293
00:28:53,555 --> 00:28:55,360
with the hawks
and eagles.

294
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,100
By the way, the paint on
the gravestone is temporary.

295
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,040
I can't find a chisel.

296
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,470
But when I do, I'll get to work.

297
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,815
Isn't burying a body
in your yard illegal?

298
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:15,875
I mean, won't the
health department get mad?

299
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:19,460
We did what people've
done for thousands of years.

300
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:24,360
When that old
lady called- Helen.

301
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:31,240
She said she didn't know what
he had, but probably cancer.

302
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,220
Yeah, we think it
was pancreatic.

303
00:29:36,255 --> 00:29:37,620
You think?

304
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,200
What did the doctors say?

305
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,480
Your dad hated doctors.

306
00:29:42,515 --> 00:29:44,260
No he didn't.

307
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:50,245
He changed a lot
since you left home.

308
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,180
I haven't forgotten
what an asshole he was

309
00:29:52,215 --> 00:29:53,907
when we were kids...

310
00:29:53,942 --> 00:29:55,600
How he treated you.

311
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,960
But he really did transform.

312
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,400
Transformed into a doctor-hater?

313
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,380
So you just let him die?

314
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,660
We prayed for him to get better.

315
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,980
What the fuck?

316
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,640
Let me guess, you
administered the chemo.

317
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,180
No.

318
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,240
Look.

319
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,470
He called up an old girlfriend.

320
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,970
A Christian
Science practitioner.

321
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,245
This is getting crazy.

322
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,810
Helen moved in and
became his nurse.

323
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,320
Spiritual nurse.

324
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,640
No drugs.

325
00:30:35,675 --> 00:30:36,920
No chemo.

326
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:42,680
So you're telling me my atheist
father became a Christian?

327
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,325
A Christian Scientist.

328
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,980
And no, he didn't become one.

329
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:49,930
He just really liked to pray.

330
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,160
My dad never prayed
a day in his life.

331
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,540
There's a lot you don't know.

332
00:30:55,575 --> 00:30:57,120
Obviously.

333
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,680
He loved music.

334
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,365
Had a great voice.

335
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,260
There was always
a record playing.

336
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:14,720
Cowboy singers like
Gene Autry during the day.

337
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:21,960
At night it was Billie
Holiday and Julie London.

338
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,830
Helen and I - we
made him comfortable.

339
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,070
We'd make him laugh.

340
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,885
And Copper slept with him.

341
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,600
It did a lot more
good than radiation.

342
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,220
I don't know this man
you're talking about.

343
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:50,880
It was something
else being with him.

344
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,900
He took the disease head on.

345
00:31:54,200 --> 00:32:00,200
His strength, it
changed my life.

346
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:18,770
<i>Wolf went up to Canada,
leaving half his life</i>

347
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:25,330
<i>Left behind two women,
each one half a wife</i>

348
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:35,060
<i>Federal men were after
him, wanted him to blame</i>

349
00:32:36,735 --> 00:32:42,735
<i>Someone from outside the
law, had betrayed his name</i>

350
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:53,280
<i>He woke up in the morning,
the light was fine and gray</i>

351
00:32:55,135 --> 00:33:01,135
<i>Knew that he was running, but
he did not know which way</i>

352
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:11,165
<i>He had a sum of money,
belonged to other men</i>

353
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:17,200
<i>Some time he'd return it, if
he passed there again</i>

354
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,825
<i>Kyle!</i>

355
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,185
Hi Luella?

356
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,710
<i>Oh my God, where
have you been?</i>

357
00:33:41,745 --> 00:33:43,942
I'm nowhere,
absolutely nowhere.

358
00:33:43,977 --> 00:33:46,105
<i>I've been
calling all day.</i>

359
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,440
The reception here
is terrible.

360
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,320
There's no internet either.

361
00:33:50,355 --> 00:33:52,085
<i>How bizarre.</i>

362
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,010
Have you talked
to Hedy?

363
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:59,280
<i>Yes, honey, and she's
such an evil bitch.</i>

364
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,720
<i>I don't think she's
going to hire you back.</i>

365
00:34:01,755 --> 00:34:04,120
But this magazine
fucking sucks without me.

366
00:34:04,155 --> 00:34:05,220
<i>I know.</i>

367
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:08,020
<i>And it'll probably
fold without you.</i>

368
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:11,970
<i>But- - I'm going to
call her in a few days.</i>

369
00:34:12,005 --> 00:34:15,880
<i>I don't know if
that's such a good idea.</i>

370
00:34:15,915 --> 00:34:17,040
Marianne!

371
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,200
Marianne!

372
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,600
Here baby.

373
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,880
Marianne!

374
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,185
Come on sweetie.

375
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,450
Where are you, little girl?

376
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:37,760
Your stupid dog has
chased her so far away

377
00:34:37,795 --> 00:34:39,620
she'll never find
her way back!

378
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,390
This is your fault.

379
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,860
I told you not to bring her.

380
00:34:42,895 --> 00:34:44,265
I knew this would happen.

381
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,125
You opened the
door and let her out!

382
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,460
Can you even comprehend
how terrified she must be?

383
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,730
You are both
fucking hopeless.

384
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,680
Go back to the
house, close the doors.

385
00:34:55,715 --> 00:34:57,140
Stay there.

386
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,300
I'll find the damn rabbit.

387
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:26,540
So?

388
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,180
You need to clean that up.

389
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,400
Right now.

390
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:54,090
I'm sorry, he's really upset.

391
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:55,745
He loves that rabbit.

392
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,220
I'm sure he does.

393
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:58,660
Like I love Copper.

394
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:00,980
But it was dumb
to bring him here.

395
00:36:01,015 --> 00:36:02,962
To bring me here?!

396
00:36:02,997 --> 00:36:04,910
He means Marianne.

397
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:09,900
I like to keep things
peaceful in my house.

398
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:17,700
Actually, it's my house now.

399
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,280
He buried your dad.

400
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,600
Right out there.

401
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,710
What went on between them?

402
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:21,020
Something weird.

403
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:24,860
You don't think...

404
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:28,760
could Birch have done
something to my dad?

405
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,360
Like murder?

406
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,900
Not that.

407
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:39,430
Well, I don't know.

408
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:43,020
I mean, the guy thinks
he's a cowboy,

409
00:37:43,055 --> 00:37:47,170
or Paul Revere,
or whatever.

410
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:49,620
I think he's crazy.

411
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:54,820
Marianne, my poor baby.

412
00:37:55,620 --> 00:38:00,500
Birch makes it sound like they
were this happy, well-adjusted

413
00:38:00,535 --> 00:38:06,360
father and son who fish and
build church pews together.

414
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:10,280
And make gorgeous sandals.

415
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,370
You think he's lying?

416
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:22,500
My dad was mean- not
fun, not supportive.

417
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,250
Maybe they got in a fight.

418
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,380
Birch killed him
in self-defense.

419
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,300
Or maybe he's a sociopath?

420
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:39,420
He killed my dad for the
house, the workshop,

421
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,560
social security,
his pension.

422
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:47,130
Maybe something
else was going on.

423
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:55,670
Once, when we were kids, Birch
shot a woodpecker with a BB gun.

424
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,560
Killed it.

425
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,045
So.

426
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,250
That's what red-necks do.

427
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:05,150
I don't think Birch
murdered your dad.

428
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:13,490
He used to kick me, call me
lard ass, called me a girl.

429
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:21,940
Once when I was asleep, he came
in here, picked up the mattress,

430
00:39:21,975 --> 00:39:23,440
and dumped me on the floor.

431
00:39:23,475 --> 00:39:25,170
Very Joan Crawford.

432
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:26,870
Be serious.

433
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:28,995
You be serious.

434
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:31,080
Open your eyes.

435
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:34,400
Your Big Papa and
Birch were a couple.

436
00:39:34,435 --> 00:39:36,280
That's disgusting.

437
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,985
The man punched me in
the face when I came out.

438
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:44,500
Do you actually think a man
like that would get into some

439
00:39:44,535 --> 00:39:48,300
dad-and-lad
roleplaying kink thing?

440
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,670
Oh-son-fuck-me-hard.

441
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:59,520
Oh-dad-that-feels-so-good.

442
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:04,610
Maybe they just kept
each other company.

443
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,780
Companions.

444
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,760
Kiss me, dammit.

445
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,100
Oh god!
Oh god! Fuck Yeah!

446
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,750
The will he left
is not official.

447
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,980
Technically, I could
easily take this house.

448
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,580
Yeah.

449
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,920
But why?

450
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,600
Aren't you in grad
school in the city?

451
00:41:55,635 --> 00:41:56,760
Yes.

452
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,860
But we could make a nice
income renting this place out.

453
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,200
Then I'll rent it.

454
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,945
I'm not comfortable with that.

455
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:12,760
I mean, do you
even have an income?

456
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:01,160
May! Darling!

457
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:19,510
Did you see those
lights again last night?

458
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:36,290
I lucked out on the
watermelon this year.

459
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,490
So how are the bees this year?

460
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:42,160
They're good, actually.

461
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,880
What eyes you have.

462
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,740
My word, aren't you a tense one.

463
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,240
Tense?

464
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,640
No.

465
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,620
You seem angry to me.

466
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:01,960
Excuse me?

467
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:06,660
I'm the chillest
guy in the Catskills.

468
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,840
How do you know Birch?

469
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,265
I'm a customer.

470
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,605
He built my puppet theater.

471
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,140
Do you see that
impeccable workmanship there?

472
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,065
It's pretty friggin' bitchin'.

473
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,360
And he practically
gave it to me for free.

474
00:44:22,395 --> 00:44:24,370
'Cause you use it
to help people.

475
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:25,900
You do kids' parties?

476
00:44:25,935 --> 00:44:27,720
Only this one.

477
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:30,910
No, I'm a licensed
art therapist,

478
00:44:30,945 --> 00:44:33,960
certified up the wazoo.

479
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:40,320
Courts call me: Hey May, get
over to the orphanage or the

480
00:44:40,355 --> 00:44:43,900
juvie hall, or
shelter for battered women.

481
00:44:43,935 --> 00:44:46,860
You know, "trauma puppets."

482
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:49,100
Does it work?

483
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,330
Good question.

484
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,860
You said that girl,
the self-mutilator,

485
00:44:55,895 --> 00:44:57,600
is in complete
remission.

486
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:58,760
That's right.

487
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,540
You should be like...

488
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:05,360
I dunno, a story on NPR.

489
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:18,080
I have Chinese ones, and
little dreadlock kids,

490
00:45:18,675 --> 00:45:21,700
and don't forget
the obese.

491
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:25,900
I have everyone under
the rainbow represented

492
00:45:25,935 --> 00:45:29,120
at home in my
puppet closet.

493
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,970
Save me one of
those venison burgers!

494
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,440
Part one.

495
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,200
The Conflict.

496
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:53,720
Son, I saw you having
sex with a boy.

497
00:45:53,755 --> 00:45:55,537
That's wrong.

498
00:45:55,572 --> 00:45:57,320
It's disgusting.

499
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:00,580
I'm embarrassed for our family.

500
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,120
You have a moral weakness.

501
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:10,660
Dad, it's true, I'm
gay, but it's not wrong.

502
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:13,220
I'm a good person.

503
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:18,700
Mom would understand if
she were still alive.

504
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:22,045
I raised a fairy!

505
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:26,160
My only son is a
pansy fruitcake.

506
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,640
My wife would disown you.

507
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:34,140
Go fuck yourself, dad.

508
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,980
Part Two. The Resolution.

509
00:46:55,015 --> 00:46:56,265
What the fuck?

510
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,600
You have a stranger
reenact the worst event

511
00:46:58,635 --> 00:47:00,105
in my life
with puppets?

512
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:02,280
It's just a funky
kind of therapy.

513
00:47:02,315 --> 00:47:03,085
It works.

514
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,660
I'm trying to help you.

515
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,200
Help me?

516
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,040
You're the weirdo.

517
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:09,970
You're the one who did
something to my dad.

518
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:11,070
Give it up!

519
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:12,670
You're jealous 'cause I had
a relationship with him,

520
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:13,960
and you didn't.

521
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:15,945
Get over it.

522
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:18,500
Get back to your
important life in the city.

523
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,020
Fucker.

524
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:23,000
Ow.

525
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:33,240
Monday I put this
place up for sale.

526
00:47:33,275 --> 00:47:35,030
And you're outta here.

527
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:41,680
Oh my God.

528
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,560
I've never gotten
that reaction before.

529
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,520
I know you're out here.

530
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,520
You like being dead?

531
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:00,460
See me punch your
new son out?

532
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,830
Remember what
you used to say?

533
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:10,500
There goes my
little girl.

534
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:36,160
<i>Peace on your journey,
light on your path</i>

535
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:42,190
<i>Pleasure in the moments when
your life is coming fast</i>

536
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:47,700
<i>Lost in emotion I
might have forgotten</i>

537
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:53,740
<i>To fill in all the spaces
between startin' and stoppin'</i>

538
00:48:53,775 --> 00:48:59,200
<i>But you know, the things I
didn't say</i>

539
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:02,680
Stay home, okay?
Watch over Kyle.

540
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:05,850
<i>The way it is today</i>

541
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:11,890
<i>As soon as you think
of something to say</i>

542
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:18,690
<i>Everything changes and the
room fades away</i>

543
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:04,400
Oh man.

544
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:07,125
Hey Harvey.

545
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,250
You've really outdone
yourself with this batch.

546
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,180
Oh, fuck you.

547
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:38,310
Come to punch me out?

548
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:41,380
Fine.
Let's do it.

549
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,380
I had a hunch you'd be here.

550
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:53,880
You think I have a sentimental
attachment to these rocks 'cause

551
00:50:53,915 --> 00:50:56,660
we used to camp here
five-hundred years ago?

552
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,900
I guess I know you
better than I thought.

553
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,940
That puppet show was
really sick and twisted.

554
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:09,380
Seemed like a good idea.

555
00:51:09,415 --> 00:51:11,280
But I guess not.

556
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:17,960
What's with the
survivalist drag?

557
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,660
Drag?

558
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:25,290
Pretending to be some pioneer
from the time of Lincoln.

559
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:28,150
I'm not pretending anything.

560
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:30,560
I just live the way I like.

561
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:35,840
If you're a
tea-bagger, just tell me now.

562
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:37,760
I'd really like to know.

563
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:41,540
I'm surprised you don't have
a poster of Sarah Palin

564
00:51:41,575 --> 00:51:42,860
over your bed.

565
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:47,100
You've got me all wrong, Andy.

566
00:51:47,135 --> 00:51:48,600
Don't call me that.

567
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,660
My name is Andrew.

568
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,720
Do you even know
who Sarah Palin is?

569
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:06,580
You do know what the
internet is, right?

570
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:10,340
I've seen it, but...

571
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:12,460
I don't need it.

572
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:19,060
And yeah, I am
familiar with that fishwife.

573
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:22,580
Fishwife?

574
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:30,260
Saw that word
somewhere recently.

575
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:38,440
Henry James says fishwife a lot.

576
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:41,070
You've read James?

577
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:44,920
I've only read What Maisie Knew.

578
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:50,280
Crazy families interest me.

579
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,000
Not surprising.

580
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:05,640
Must be nice to concentrate
the way people used to.

581
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,180
My brain's addled.

582
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:12,680
I can't focus.

583
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:17,020
But you're getting a doctorate.

584
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,280
I take Adderall.

585
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,040
What's that?

586
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,740
It's a type of speed
they prescribe

587
00:53:26,775 --> 00:53:29,400
for attention
deficit disorder.

588
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:33,320
That makes a lot of sense.

589
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,920
It does in my world.

590
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,980
What is that shit?

591
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,120
This?

592
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,820
Harvey's Wonder Tonic.

593
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:41,680
<i>Left me, left me,
left me all alone</i>

594
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:45,890
<i>Then you call me
cryin' on the phone</i>

595
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:55,200
<i>Left me, left me, left
me on my own</i>

596
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:59,810
<i>Don't you know you turn
my heart to stone</i>

597
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:25,370
Don't be a milksop.

598
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,540
Come in.

599
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:42,580
<i>Hey now, go down, whose
turn is it this time?</i>

600
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:47,750
<i>Hey now, go 'round,
won't you be my sunshine</i>

601
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:55,290
<i>Well I don't know
where you are going</i>

602
00:55:55,330 --> 00:56:00,470
<i>and I don't care
where you've been</i>

603
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:05,270
<i>We've shared this moment
in the sunlight,</i>

604
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:11,310
<i>and maybe we will
meet again</i>

605
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:17,580
<i>I've called you my friend,
and I've called you my lover</i>

606
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:25,690
<i>And though our time
might soon be over</i>

607
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:28,290
Why are you still
wearing those?

608
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:35,940
<i>Well hey now, go down,
whose turn is it this time?</i>

609
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,440
If I don't get my
job back I'm screwed.

610
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,780
But why can't you
get something else?

611
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:54,020
I screwed up, and if the
magazine won't have me back,

612
00:57:54,055 --> 00:57:57,820
no one in the fashion world
will trust me again.

613
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,860
Screwed up?

614
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:02,785
Oh!

615
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:04,790
I love cha-cha.

616
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:09,060
More liked fucked-up.

617
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:11,230
At a shoot.

618
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:16,220
I stole some
clothes from a designer.

619
00:58:16,255 --> 00:58:19,860
Like twenty-thousand
dollars worth.

620
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:23,000
Oops.

621
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:27,040
Exactly.

622
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:37,620
Have you ever heard that
phrase, Think Outside the Box?

623
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:40,125
Of course.

624
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,430
It's called a tired cliché.

625
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:45,800
But it's a true cliché.

626
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:52,770
Look, as a therapist I'm also
trained to give career advice,

627
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:57,780
and what you've got to
do is the unexpected.

628
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:04,100
Clothes, magazines,
it's what I live for.

629
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,885
Don't be a slave.

630
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,360
Start your own magazine.

631
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,605
That sounds great and all.

632
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:21,320
But it's the
principle of the thing.

633
00:59:21,355 --> 00:59:23,570
I gave the clothes back.

634
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:28,780
I took a Xanax that day and I
don't know what came over me.

635
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:38,750
What kind of
childhood did you have, Kyle?

636
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:41,490
Childhood is off limits.

637
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:46,130
It was terrible.

638
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:51,260
But I've wrapped that part of
my life up in a steel wool, May,

639
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:55,000
and I put it down
the garbage disposal.

640
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:59,210
My word.

641
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:03,040
So, what exactly happened?

642
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:06,880
Nothing happened.

643
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:09,320
I don't follow.

644
01:00:18,430 --> 01:00:22,480
That was probably Luella
telling me that Hedy-that's my

645
01:00:22,515 --> 01:00:26,530
boss-will be calling
tomorrow to give me my job back.

646
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:29,300
Because she needs me.

647
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:33,610
I have a lot of talent, May.

648
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:36,100
I believe you.

649
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,180
I'm shit-faced.

650
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,640
I'm getting sober.

651
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:49,780
I gotta get that
puppet theater back home.

652
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:51,990
Where's Andrew?

653
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,500
I'm really worried.

654
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:59,040
I want him here now!

655
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:40,820
May, May!

656
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:46,900
Cock-a-doodle-do.

657
01:02:46,935 --> 01:02:48,565
Oh my God.

658
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,500
May, it's time to get up.

659
01:02:50,535 --> 01:02:51,245
Where am I?

660
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,985
At Andrew's house - Birch's.

661
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:56,740
I went out looking for
them, but I got scared.

662
01:02:56,775 --> 01:02:59,285
Don't worry about those two.

663
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:01,860
It's not like
they're prepared to camp.

664
01:03:01,895 --> 01:03:03,960
They could die out there.

665
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,625
Birch?
Impossible.

666
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:11,960
That kid takes to the woods
like, like, I dunno, trees,

667
01:03:11,995 --> 01:03:13,880
dirt, and newts.

668
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,480
We don't even know
if they're together.

669
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:23,040
Have some more wine.

670
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:28,140
It's Independence Day in
the Catskill Mountains.

671
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,945
Maybe that might
work for you.

672
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:35,645
But this situation is
potentially life or death.

673
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:41,680
Around here it's fine and normal
to pass time in the woods.

674
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:45,500
Birch'll look out
for your boyfriend.

675
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:55,200
"YOU ARE SUCH A MAIDEN FAIR ALL
IN YOUR ROBES OF RED WILL YOU

676
01:03:56,915 --> 01:04:02,820
TAKE ME IN YOUR ARMS
AND HAVE ME IN YOUR BED?"

677
01:04:02,850 --> 01:04:08,850
"AWAY, AWAY YOU COAL BLACKSMITH
WHAT YOU DO SAY IS WRONG DOST

678
01:04:09,035 --> 01:04:13,260
THOU THINK A LASS LIKE ME
CAN BE HAD FOR JUST A SONG?"

679
01:04:13,295 --> 01:04:17,132
AND HE SAID, "BIDE, LADY BIDE.

680
01:04:17,167 --> 01:04:20,935
YOUR LUST FOR ME DON'T HIDE.

681
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:26,970
THIS LUSTY SMITH WILL BE YOUR
LOVE AND POUND AWAY YOUR PRIDE."

682
01:04:55,660 --> 01:05:01,660
In this old tale we have a man
named August Orizaba who carried

683
01:05:07,895 --> 01:05:11,860
ten pounds of gold
bullion in his pockets.

684
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:18,560
His clothes sagged funny as
he walked down the street.

685
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:25,340
This was in Tahiti in
the year 1849.

686
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:33,840
August walked into a saloon
where he met Herman Melville.

687
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:44,120
They ate fish and drank all
night as hula girls tried to

688
01:05:45,915 --> 01:05:48,540
catch their attention.

689
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:55,840
But the two men were
fascinated by each other.

690
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:08,300
When they were good and drunk,
August took out some gold and

691
01:06:09,555 --> 01:06:11,120
paid the tab.

692
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:18,250
They walked outside
into a beautiful jungle.

693
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:28,360
August tried to kiss Herman
Melville, but Melville was

694
01:06:33,035 --> 01:06:38,360
hesitant and said good-night.

695
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:52,020
You don't respect
who I am or what I do.

696
01:06:52,055 --> 01:06:53,767
Shut up, Kyle.

697
01:06:53,802 --> 01:06:55,480
You're so needy.

698
01:06:57,260 --> 01:06:59,445
You think I'm superficial.

699
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:03,060
You say it all the time, Andrew.

700
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:11,060
Ninety-five percent of
you is loving and amazing.

701
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:17,560
The other five percent,
your coating, is like some

702
01:07:17,595 --> 01:07:20,340
Hello Kitty up-fuck.

703
01:07:21,550 --> 01:07:26,985
That's right, I'm
a cartoon up-fuck.

704
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:32,000
And speaking of fucking, why do
I practically have to bribe you

705
01:07:32,035 --> 01:07:34,500
to stick your dick in me?!

706
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:48,880
I used to hate it when you'd go
back to the Adirondacks at the

707
01:07:48,915 --> 01:07:50,440
end of summer.

708
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:57,360
The rest of the
year I'd miss you.

709
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:08,020
In bed at night, falling asleep,
I used to imagine you and me

710
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:11,830
having adventures together.

711
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,520
Really?

712
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:18,320
That must sound strange to you.

713
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:20,500
Not at all.

714
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:31,180
Sorry about that.

715
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:35,090
Does it hurt?

716
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,290
Nah.

717
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,460
Oh my God.

718
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:05,830
Oh my God.

719
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,800
God-fucking-dammit!

720
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:33,405
Marianne!

721
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:34,530
Come back.

722
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:38,560
Copper!

723
01:12:38,595 --> 01:12:39,660
Marianne!

724
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,340
Copper!

725
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:48,760
Marianne!

726
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:52,210
Come back!

727
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:07,555
Whoa hey.

728
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:09,830
What happened?

729
01:13:11,830 --> 01:13:13,460
Why you so upset?

730
01:13:13,970 --> 01:13:15,480
Hey, Hey!

731
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,570
We just lost track of time.

732
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:20,920
We crashed in the woods.

733
01:13:27,550 --> 01:13:30,950
Tell me why
you're so freaked out.

734
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:38,800
They're both gone.

735
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:46,860
I don't know if they're
alive, or where they are.

736
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:50,280
Oh God.

737
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:56,020
This is the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

738
01:14:00,850 --> 01:14:02,650
Copper will be back.

739
01:14:04,990 --> 01:14:07,220
I can't say the
same for the rabbit.

740
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:12,640
Marianne!

741
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,400
He's asleep.

742
01:14:34,150 --> 01:14:36,020
I gave him an Ambien.

743
01:14:36,055 --> 01:14:37,680
Incredible.

744
01:14:41,180 --> 01:14:44,320
I almost brought Copper into the
woods with me, but told him to

745
01:14:44,355 --> 01:14:47,320
stay here, to keep Kyle safe.

746
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:52,820
I'm really sorry.

747
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:58,120
That dog is my last
connection to Walter.

748
01:15:00,070 --> 01:15:01,660
What about me?

749
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:05,500
I'm actually blood
related to the guy.

750
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:18,760
Kyle's convinced
that you killed my dad.

751
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:24,260
Why would I do that?

752
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,620
I dunno.

753
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:30,680
So you can live here.

754
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:34,700
I lived here before
your dad got sick.

755
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,700
I didn't kill him.

756
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:41,800
I loved the guy.

757
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:47,140
Kyle also thinks...

758
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:54,520
...he thinks you and
my dad were lovers.

759
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:56,860
What do you think?

760
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:12,700
I wish we could've just
stayed in the forest.

761
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,420
You can.

762
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:20,340
I mean with you.

763
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:28,280
I learned that I've loved
you since we were kids.

764
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:34,400
You've got a boyfriend.

765
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:47,860
Look, Birch, I know we
had sex and all,

766
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:51,120
But are you
even gay?

767
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:55,520
I don't think so.

768
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:58,200
You don't know?

769
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:01,105
I'm not sure.

770
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:05,040
Either way, I don't really
care if I am or if I'm not.

771
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,640
That makes no sense.

772
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:11,100
How do you identify?

773
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:13,660
As a man.

774
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:16,270
I've got a dick.

775
01:17:16,310 --> 01:17:17,460
I've got a brain.

776
01:17:17,495 --> 01:17:18,105
A heart.

777
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:19,580
What are you talking about?

778
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:24,000
You were gay last night.

779
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:29,760
Let's put it this
way, I'm gay for you.

780
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:35,880
Otherwise, I really
don't think in those terms.

781
01:17:35,915 --> 01:17:39,180
It doesn't even cross my
mind to think that way.

782
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,560
Do you think of men
when you jerk off?

783
01:17:44,595 --> 01:17:45,700
Sure.

784
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:48,020
Do you think about women?

785
01:17:48,055 --> 01:17:49,500
Oh yeah.

786
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:53,140
Then you're bisexual.

787
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:55,780
Okay.

788
01:17:57,720 --> 01:17:59,160
All right.

789
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,680
You've got a boyfriend, Andy.

790
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:33,940
And he needs you.

791
01:19:31,860 --> 01:19:32,800
Hedy!

792
01:19:32,835 --> 01:19:33,740
Hi!

793
01:19:34,210 --> 01:19:35,920
I finally got you!

794
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:44,800
Oh...

795
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:49,830
Yeah.

796
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:50,980
No problem.

797
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:53,680
Yeah.

798
01:19:55,770 --> 01:19:56,820
Thanks.

799
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:17,150
You hit really him hard.

800
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:18,000
Watch.

801
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:20,420
I don't need to see that.

802
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:35,840
This is the worst
hangover of my life.

803
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:39,320
Oh God.

804
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:44,980
At this point I'm so fucked that
murdering Hedy is actually the

805
01:21:45,015 --> 01:21:46,580
best thing I could do.

806
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:49,800
I agree.

807
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:52,720
Very wise career move.

808
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:58,460
It hurts, Andrew, it hurts
bad when people don't like you.

809
01:21:59,260 --> 01:22:01,420
I'm in pain, okay.

810
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:03,700
The worst ever.

811
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:09,400
Please try to pull
yourself together.

812
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:12,260
You spent the night
with that hick-

813
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:15,980
least you could do
is be nice to me.

814
01:22:16,510 --> 01:22:19,140
Unemployment can
make anyone lose it.

815
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:22,140
You still care
about me, don't you?

816
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:26,180
You know this is just
how I get sometimes.

817
01:22:26,220 --> 01:22:28,320
I know.

818
01:22:31,290 --> 01:22:34,560
But we should face
the facts and...

819
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:40,360
...know that Marianne is
probably dead.

820
01:22:40,395 --> 01:22:41,600
Please.

821
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:49,780
We should go back
to the city.

822
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:53,180
You're not cut out
for living up here.

823
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:58,300
What am I going to do?

824
01:22:59,060 --> 01:23:01,020
You've got to get out there.

825
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:04,600
You're going to make your way.

826
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:06,980
You're super creative.

827
01:23:08,290 --> 01:23:10,280
Do something unexpected.

828
01:23:12,530 --> 01:23:14,400
That's what May said.

829
01:23:14,430 --> 01:23:17,100
You gotta think
outside the magazine box.

830
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:19,980
May said that too.

831
01:23:20,710 --> 01:23:22,840
You could be a
buyer for a store.

832
01:23:22,875 --> 01:23:24,810
You could design.

833
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:27,080
You have options.

834
01:23:28,940 --> 01:23:30,580
Exactly.

835
01:23:31,220 --> 01:23:32,720
Look at Birch.

836
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:36,060
He wants a table, he builds it.

837
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:39,200
He wants sandals, he makes them.

838
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:42,920
You need a job in fashion.

839
01:23:43,630 --> 01:23:45,260
Make it happen.

840
01:23:48,830 --> 01:23:52,600
Sounds like you two Boy Scouts
had a great bonding experience.

841
01:23:54,810 --> 01:23:56,060
Yeah...

842
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:58,320
Ha!

843
01:24:00,810 --> 01:24:02,400
I knew it.

844
01:24:03,820 --> 01:24:05,250
Knew what?

845
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,040
You guys did it.

846
01:24:07,820 --> 01:24:09,190
Oh please.

847
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:13,520
I can hear it in
your voice, Andrew.

848
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:17,060
You've fallen for
his Farmer John act.

849
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:20,060
You seduced him.

850
01:24:20,095 --> 01:24:21,020
Admit it.

851
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:29,660
I can see it in your eyes.

852
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:47,360
Yeah.

853
01:24:52,940 --> 01:24:54,180
Well?

854
01:24:54,870 --> 01:24:56,200
Well what?

855
01:24:57,020 --> 01:24:58,460
Want me to cry?

856
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:03,300
I cried over you last
night, but you were not here.

857
01:25:04,660 --> 01:25:06,760
I'm really sorry.

858
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:12,260
I have my career to worry about.

859
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:16,580
I still love you.

860
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:20,560
You know that.

861
01:25:23,260 --> 01:25:26,560
Did you say that to
him too as you sang

862
01:25:26,595 --> 01:25:29,070
cowboy songs under
the stars?

863
01:25:30,020 --> 01:25:32,020
It just happened.

864
01:25:43,950 --> 01:25:46,100
You're still my guy.

865
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:08,940
COPPER!

866
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:12,080
Here boy!

867
01:26:59,420 --> 01:27:00,570
Kyle!

868
01:27:00,605 --> 01:27:01,720
Come eat!

869
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:28,700
I made a decision.

870
01:27:29,380 --> 01:27:31,120
I'm going back to the city.

871
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:32,600
Alone.

872
01:27:33,740 --> 01:27:34,960
Oh?

873
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:38,560
I'll take your car.

874
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:41,470
Um...

875
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:42,720
Fine.

876
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:46,040
I'll come back on the
bus in a couple weeks.

877
01:27:48,820 --> 01:27:51,180
What are you gonna
to do in the city?

878
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:54,550
Something...

879
01:27:54,585 --> 01:27:55,820
unexpected.

880
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:00,820
Are you gonna be okay?

881
01:28:01,180 --> 01:28:02,240
Yeah.

882
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:03,640
Probably.

883
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:05,760
I don't know.

884
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:10,500
I'll come back with you.

885
01:28:10,535 --> 01:28:11,500
Really?

886
01:28:11,530 --> 01:28:12,460
No.

887
01:28:13,770 --> 01:28:15,280
I want you to stay.

888
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:17,980
I need to figure myself out.

889
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:23,910
Birch, how much do you
want for your sandals?

890
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:25,700
Nothing.
They're yours.

891
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:28,260
Thanks...

892
01:28:30,820 --> 01:28:32,680
Have you ever
thought of selling them?

893
01:28:32,715 --> 01:28:34,180
Professionally?

894
01:28:35,140 --> 01:28:37,480
Now and then I sell them
down at the flea market.

895
01:28:37,515 --> 01:28:38,760
Forty bucks a pair.

896
01:28:39,890 --> 01:28:41,130
Are you kidding me?

897
01:28:41,165 --> 01:28:42,460
Forty dollars?

898
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:45,680
It's not like
there's a high demand.

899
01:28:45,715 --> 01:28:47,660
Are you insane?

900
01:28:48,460 --> 01:28:50,160
These things are incredible.

901
01:28:50,195 --> 01:28:51,500
People will love them.

902
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:53,340
Forty dollars?

903
01:28:53,780 --> 01:28:54,985
He's right.

904
01:28:55,020 --> 01:28:56,680
You could sell them for
at least two hundred.

905
01:28:56,715 --> 01:28:58,580
No way!

906
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:02,520
I've got the most
fucking genius idea ever!

907
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:59,100
I'm going to start a
website called, "Leather."

908
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:01,860
And I'm going to see if I
can sell your custom-made

909
01:30:01,895 --> 01:30:03,220
sandals on the internet.

910
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:05,245
How does that sound to you?

911
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:08,840
Let's talk when you
make your first sale.

912
01:30:08,875 --> 01:30:10,540
I'm serious, Birch.

913
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:11,980
I know.

914
01:30:13,060 --> 01:30:14,740
Sure, I'll help you out.

915
01:30:17,420 --> 01:30:18,700
Promise?

916
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:06,840
Are you afraid?

917
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:11,460
A little.

918
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:13,640
Good.

919
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:18,320
Why good?

920
01:31:19,180 --> 01:31:22,180
A little fear will
keep this special.

921
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:27,640
I'm so glad you're here.

922
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:32,140
I am too.

923
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,860
Leave that world behind...

924
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:40,060
for a while.

925
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:42,330
What the...?

926
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:45,145
Copper!

927
01:32:45,180 --> 01:32:47,270
Get back in here!

928
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:51,720
Party's up here.

929
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:57,225
Hey Boy.

930
01:32:57,260 --> 01:32:59,480
Oh I missed you boy.

931
01:33:00,140 --> 01:33:01,605
C'mere.

932
01:33:01,640 --> 01:33:07,530
Oh, I missed you boy.
