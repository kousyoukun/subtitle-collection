1
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,077
-WHAT THE FUCK IS SHE DOING?
-AGAIN?

2
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,162
-YOUR LIFE IS PRECIOUS.
-STOP THAT, YOU FUCKING BITCH.

3
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,873
-I THINK SHE'S POSSESSED.
-FUCKING ATTENTION SEEKER.

4
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:25,001
WHY DON'T YOU CUT MORE AND DEEPER?

5
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,999
You fucking bitch! Gosh…

6
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,752
You hurt my damn eyes.

7
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,507
Oh, my. Did someone just hurt you?

8
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,096
Hey, I'm so fucking curious.

9
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,140
-Who watched this bitch's live feed?
-What are those?

10
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,725
I couldn't. It was fucking disgusting.

11
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,978
Fuck. You're just doing this
for fun, right?

12
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,605
You're a goddamn
Instagram attention seeker, aren't you?

13
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:28,690
Hey.

14
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:32,861
Are you going to keep doing this? Tell me.
Are you?

15
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,280
I'm sorry.

16
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:37,740
She frustrates me.

17
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,160
Look at you smiling.

18
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,664
Hey, I'm so fucking dying to know.

19
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,085
Is it true that you fucked your brother?

20
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:54,173
Hey, is this funny?

21
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,217
Are you pregnant?

22
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,094
Who is the baby's father?

23
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,519
Hello?

24
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,151
I'm late.

25
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,113
I'm late.

26
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,875
I'm late.

27
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,754
I'm so late.

28
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,172
I'm late.

29
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:58,024
-Do you want some spicy rice cakes?
-But I'm not on my period today.

30
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,569
Come on, let's eat spicy rice cakes.

31
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,863
I said I'm not on my period today.

32
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,652
I can't wait any longer.

33
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,695
What are you doing?

34
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,114
Give it back.

35
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,261
I'm sorry. I didn't want to be mean.

36
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,055
Other guys were there, so…

37
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,599
You must take this to the grave.

38
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,019
It has to stay between you and me.

39
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:29,944
Here.

40
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,281
You haven't eaten anything, right?
Eat a lot.

41
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,329
Have you been eating well these days?

42
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,094
What about you? You've been eating well?

43
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,408
Hey.

44
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,703
What did you two do yesterday?

45
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,456
I'm asking you. What did you do yesterday?

46
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,002
You stupid bitch. Are you a mute?

47
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:33,633
Hey, aren't you going to answer?

48
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,385
Answer me, you fucking bitch.

49
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,392
Hey.

50
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,562
You answer instead.

51
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,774
You answer now.

52
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,234
Are you two going out?

53
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,029
Are you two going out? Answer me.

54
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:57,782
Fuck. Are you fucking each other?

55
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,159
Are you two fucking each other?

56
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,124
Your mouth.

57
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:24,934
Are you sleepy?

58
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,193
What happened to your face?

59
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,244
Make sure you take this medicine.

60
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:47,748
Don't skip it.
You have to take it on time, okay?

61
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,127
But I'll have surgery.
I'll get an abortion.

62
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,838
So why do I have to take this?

63
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,340
Why? Why do I have to take it?

64
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,759
I pulled out,

65
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,762
and you took the pills, right?

66
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:08,144
Did you check the expiration date
before you took it?

67
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,897
Or maybe something went wrong

68
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,317
when you got prescribed.

69
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,237
Never mind.

70
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,573
I'll take care of it.

71
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,576
I told you. I'm getting an abortion.

72
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,120
I'm going to have surgery.
I'm getting rid of it.

73
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,581
How much did they say it costs?
How much will it be?

74
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:30,499
I said I'll take care of it.

75
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,711
Why do you have to be like this?
It's hard for me as it is now.

76
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,268
I'm sleepy.

77
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,191
Honey.

78
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,860
I need an operation.

79
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,864
Can I have some money?

80
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:11,916

-Ma'am!

86
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,681
-<i>Then how do sperm and eggs meet?</i>
-Yes?

87

Help yourself.

97
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,085
Ms. Heo. You too.

98
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,169
Sure.

99
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,776
At your age, you have to eat well.

100
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,403
That's how you become healthy.

101
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,029
Don't you agree, Ms. Heo?

102
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,532
Of course, sir. You're right.

103
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,452
Sejin.

104
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,955
You can sit comfortably, okay?

105
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,625
It's okay. Don't be nervous
and just sit comfortably.

106
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,043
Go on.

107
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,549
-Help yourself, Ms. Heo.
-Okay.

108
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:47,678
I have no appetite.

109
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:48,929
Maybe it's because it's so hot.

110
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,560
It's hot, isn't it? Have some soda too.

111
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:55,769
Thanks.

112
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,862
Sejin, we're on your side, okay?

113
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,574
So you should trust us

114
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,744
and tell us the truth,

115
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:16,165
swearing by God's name.

116
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,502
About the rumor…

117
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,047
Is it true?

118
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,092
How far along are you?

119
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,345
How many weeks?

120
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,846
I'll have an operation.

121
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,599
I'll get an abortion.

122
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,568
Are you sure?

123
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,407
Stop sitting like that
and be more comfortable.

124
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,284
It's not good for the baby.

125
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,162
Mr. Shim.

126
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,706
-Yes?
-Drop and get down on the floor.

127
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,210
Now!

128
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,092
Get down!

129
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:33,409
It's all right. Just eat.

130
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,123
Kids these days…

131
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,417
We have such a low birth rate these days,

132
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,335
and they're so patriotic, indeed.

133
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,173
We don't need to think more.

134
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,176
Did you tell anyone else
about this, Sejin?

135
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,560
All right.

136
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,769
Then,

137
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,856
I don't think we need to talk more
about this matter.

138
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,899
Here. Sign it.

WRITTEN OATH, SHIM SANGSEOP AND I
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH EACH OTHER.

What do you see in him anyway?

141
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,956
If you hang out with a chicken,
you learn how to be fed on the ground.

142
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,793
But if you hang out with an eagle,
you learn how to fly in the sky.

143
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,923
Your name is Sejin, right?

144
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:34,053
Just think of this
as saving a person's life.

145
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,356
Sejin, when you're done reading,

146
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,027
just write your name at the bottom,
next to "I promise."

147
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,460
Live well.

148
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,505
That's the best revenge.

149
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,174
Good luck, Sejin.

150
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,613
Sejin, look at me.

151
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,533
Come on.

152
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:39,993
Come on, look at me.

153
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,665
Look at me.

154
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,101
It's funny, right?

155
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,979
Are you hungry?

156
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,819
Do you want a baby brother or a sister?

157
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:28,959
I don't like ramen.
Especially when I have to eat it alone.

158
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,173
And I prefer to be the youngest one.

159
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,558
How old are you?

160
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,395
Are you 14?

161
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,569
Then you're a grown-up too.

162
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,152
Fuck! Fuck!

163
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,780
Fuck! Fuck!

164
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,661
You fucking bitch. Do you want to die?

165
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,840
I'm sorry.

166
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,927
I'm so sorry.

167
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,264
Is it because of what I did to you

168
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,933
in front of other girls?

169
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,561
You know me, right?

170
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,191
Why are you doing this to me?

171
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,028
Why are you doing this to me,
fucking bitch?

172
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:24,616
Fuck.

173
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,288
I'm going to kill that son of a bitch.

174
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,196
What?

175
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,286
Damn it.

176
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,462
Fuck.

177
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:47,259
REST IN PEACE

178
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,223
What are you doing? Are you sleepy?

179
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:37,726
A little.

180
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:40,770
I've never seen you here before.
So I was just curious.

181
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,732
Did you run away from home?

182
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,860
Why? Where are you from?

183
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,285
Can't you ask one question at a time?

184
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,502
I'm Juyeong. I'm 18.

185
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,839
I've been living on the streets
for four years.

186
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,007
You?

187
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,343
I'm Sejin. I'm 18 too.

188
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,512
I need an operation to get rid of a baby.

189
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,056
So you need money?

190
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,022
A little.

191
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:27,609
What's that? Is that yours?

192
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:29,694
Are you good at skateboarding?

193
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:30,946
A little.

194
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,365
Is that all you can say? "A little"?

195
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:36,576
A little.

196
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,579
Will you help me?

197
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:43,750
Then I'll give you some money.

198
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:44,936
Hey, if you get caught,

199
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,648
you have to get on your skateboard
and get away fucking fast. Okay?

200
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,152
-If you get caught, you're fucked.
-Go, go.

201
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,904
You're a scaredy-cat, aren't you?

202
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,573
No, I'm not.

203
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,450
I think you are.

204
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,035
No, I never get scared.

205
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:02,787
Oh, my gosh!

206
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:18,845
Open your bag.

207
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,454
Do you want me to come with you?
I'm bored anyway.

208
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,299
Are you sure?

209
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:45,932
How far along are you?

210
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:49,269
You don't even know that much?
We have a problem then.

211
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,648
You know, you can't get rid of a baby

212
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,608
by just taking some pills.

213
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,820
Go to a pharmacist for getting medicines,

214
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,363
and a doctor for getting prescribed.

215
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,535
And you must get a massage too.

216
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:09,247
I'm an expert at it.
Consider yourself lucky.

217
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,208
You two ran away from home, right?

218
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,711
You must be hungry then.

219
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,798
Why don't we go to a motel?

220
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:23,678
Do you guys like the Sprinkle Chicken?

221
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:25,889
You know what it is, right?

222
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:31,811
I've bought food
for loads of kids like you.

223
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,731
You two ran away from home, right?

224
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:37,025
-Isn't that a chicken skewer?
-You know…

225
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,819
-Isn't it?
-…I bet you did because you're pregnant.

226
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:44,783
Mister, can you order us a pizza too?

227
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:46,826
Sure. Go ahead.

228
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,162
Then give us some money.

229
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,915
Don't you think you're going too far?

230
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,843
It feels so fucking good.

231
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,388
It's hell outside,
but it's heaven in here.

232
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,518
Hey, it's too cramped.

233
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,812
-It's too cramped!
-You have plenty of space.

234
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,438
-Move a little.
-My arm!

235
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,025
Hey, let's do that thing.

236
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:22,111
-You know that thing?
-Hey, I…

237
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,655
Let's do it again.

238
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,659
-Okay. One, two.
-One, two.

239
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:28,993
Oh, my! Hey!

240
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,163
You just flew.

241
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,456
Did I?

242
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,125
You see, I did some boxing
before I got into this business.

243
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,086
-Lift your leg.
-What is boxing?

244
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,255
-You have to focus.
-Why is yours so long?

245
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,757
Giving good massages requires focus.
Hey, focus, will you?

246
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,884
You're taller than me. Stop, now.

247
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,720
Gosh.

248
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,305
Hey, move a little.

249
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,891
Come on. Move.

250
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,894
God, this is nice.

251
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:56,896
It's damn nice.

252
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,943
Hey.

253
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,862
You guys swiped those, didn't you?

254
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,531
-Seriously.
-Bitch.

255
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:12,328
I know I sell illegal drugs.

256
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,497
But I'm not a bad person.

257
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:18,042
But if you guys get fresh with me,

258
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,461
then I have no choice. Hey.

259
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:21,963
Go take a shower.

260
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:26,342
I'll get on with the massage
before she takes the medicine.

261
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,888
Come on.

262
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,242
It feels good, right?

263
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,417
Just tell me if it hurts. Okay?

264
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:07,550
By the way,
you guys need some money, don't you?

265
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:13,598
How about you give me what I want?

266
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,559
Then I could give you
those medicines for free.

267
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,105
Will you trust me
and leave everything to me?

268
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:23,900
Or do you want to figure it out
by yourself?

269
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,408
Suck my dick, then.

270
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,340
Hey. Please help me.

271
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:49,425
Help, please…

272
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,887
Hey, move!

273
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:56,599
I said move! Shit!

274
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,478
Please help me…

275
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,318
Fucking help me, please!

276
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,278
Son of a bitch!

277
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,954
Hey, come here.

278
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,039
Come here. Come on.

279
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,500
Why don't you come suck my dick?

280
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:23,918
Just suck my dick.

281
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,253
Come here.

282
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,422
Just come here. Come on.

283
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,923
-My dick.
-You shit!

284
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,426
You little shit. Come here.

285
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,844
-Come here.
-Shit.

286
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:38,307
What the fuck? You fucking
son of a bitch! You fucking shit!

287
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:41,144
-I'll kill you, fucking shit.
-You…

288
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:42,979
-Go kill yourself, son of a bitch.
-Come here. Come.

289
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:45,565
Fuck! What the fuck is it to do with you?

290
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:47,734
Shit.

291
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:52,822
Fucking bitch, she's biting the hand
that just fed her.

292
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,240
That ungrateful bitch.

293
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,119
Fuck!

294
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,374
You fucking son of a bitch.

295
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,709
Wake up, you fucker.

296
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,089
How old are you?

297
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,924
I'm 18.

298
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,801
Me too.

299
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:16,429
We're 20 and 30!

300
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,565
Hey, you need money, don't you?

301
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,942
Do you want to do a part-time job?

302
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,945
You won't get paid much though.

303
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,448
But still, do you want to do it?

304
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,036
You know, you ruined everything.

305
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,635
Hey, do you have a lighter?

306
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,796
I'm pregnant, you know.

307
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:34,966
I need an operation
to get rid of the baby.

308
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,552
Hey…

309
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:41,013
So can you help me? Please?

310
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,182
Please?

311
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,433
Were you raped?

312
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:46,853
Are you disabled?

313
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,107
Did you really think it would be
that fucking easy?

314
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:52,984
You can't have an operation

315
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:56,154
unless you were raped, disabled
or pregnant with your family's baby.

316
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:59,157
And you're a minor,
so you'll need a guardian present.

317
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,451
Exactly. You can be my guardian, no?

318
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,745
Jesus Christ! Do you really think
it's that simple?

319
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:09,208
They'll put scissors in your womb
and hack up the baby in your belly!

320
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,335
Forget it.

321
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,880
If you have the guts to do that,
just try to live a better life

322
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,966
or sue that motherfucker.

323
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:30,313
Hey. Why are you so angry?

324
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,023
Why are you shouting at me?

325
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:34,692
Forget it.

326
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,155
Go to church and pray first.

327
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,950
Otherwise, the baby you kill

328
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,578
might haunt you
for the rest of your life, they say.

329
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,374
Hey. You like me, don't you?

330
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,337
Then prove it.

331
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:23,241
What the fuck? There's nothing.

332
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:28,579
What?

333
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:32,667
Oh, fuck, yes!

334
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:49,016
Lift it.

335
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,357
Damn it!

336
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,701
What the fuck?

337
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,411
It spins…

338
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,746
Damn it.

339
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,882
You're fucked.

340
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,843
You little shit.

341
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,138
You fucking bitch.

342
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,390
My fucking phone.

343
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,394
Son of a bitch. Fuck.

344
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,066
What the fuck are you doing? Help me.

345
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,449
Move the fuck over. Damn it.

346
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,868
Move, asshole.

347
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:50,286
Just fucking move!

348
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:51,495
Dear God.

349
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,709
Why do we hate you?

350
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,266
Does anyone here take medicine regularly
for a chronic disease?

351
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,269
Raise your hand.

352
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,900
What kind?

353
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,152
I have esophagitis.

354
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,529
And you?

355
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,490
I take pills for my headache.

356
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,619
All right… You two,

357
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,038
go home now.

358
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:37,208
Go home.

359
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,556
Don't rub it.

360
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,072
How could you lie?

361
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,618
You're pregnant, aren't you?

362
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:18,666
You three are okay.

363
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,877
And you, go home.

364
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,345
So what about you?

365
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,514
Are you three still up for it?

366
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:36,142
I'm still up for it.

367
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,781
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

368
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,208
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

369
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:05,559
I'm so cold.

370
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:08,562
-I'm buying this.
-Okay.

371
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:26,830
Hey, doesn't the medicine work?

372
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:30,334
I knew it wouldn't work.
We didn't even know what they were for.

373
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:32,920
They weren't strong enough. I need
something stronger and more effective.

374
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,838
We need to save more money.

375
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:41,136
KISSING BOOTH

376
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,225
This one for today.

377
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,756
Do you want me to sing any song for you?

378
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,219
Forget about singing.

379
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,055
Why don't we go on a date outside?

380
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:28,475
Do you want to smoke with me?

381
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:37,484
Here, this way. This is the main room.

382
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:41,780
The one who used to live here
was a shaman.

383
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:44,450
That's why it's cheap.

384
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:47,119
-Excuse me.
-Sure.

385
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,830
Hello? This is World Real Estate.

386
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:54,626
Yes. Which application did you use?

387
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:57,921
I'll call you back a bit later.

388
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,506
Yes.

389
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:08,265
If you put paper over the walls,
it'll be perfect for four people.

390
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:10,976
You won't be able to find a house
at this price.

391
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:12,895
And you know what they say?

392
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,813
If good people live in a shaman's house,

393
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:17,232
good spirits stick to them
and they'll have a good life.

394
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:18,942
If you sign the contract today,

395
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:21,528
I'll pay extra attention to this house.

396
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:23,780
Just trust me and sign it,

397
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:25,908
then I'll pay for the wallpaper.

398
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,913
Oh, right. I'm sorry, sir.

399
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:33,874
I think I left my phone at the house
after taking some photos.

400
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,877
Can I borrow your key for a minute?

401
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:40,339
I'll be right back.

402
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,724
Here.

403
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,809
Thanks. It won't take long.

404
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:14,618
When I was in middle school…

405
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,538
my mom and I went to the Hongcheon River

406
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,249
during my summer vacation.

407
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,419
And I almost drowned.

408
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:28,674
Some guys

409
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,802
threw a fishing net at me,

410
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:35,055
and I held onto the net.

411
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,766
That's how I was saved.

412
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:40,936
And then my mom fucking told me

413
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:44,523
that a monk said

414
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:47,109
a drowned spirit stuck to me
when that happened.

415
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,447
That's why I keep running away from home.

416
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:56,451
God, it's fucking hot.

417
00:50:05,001 --> 00:50:07,796
I haven't gone back home for four years.

418
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,514
I can't go home…

419
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,436
That guy's not an engineer.
You have to watch out for him.

420
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:25,188
Watch out for the blade too.
It's pointing at me.

421
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,315
I'm so scared…

422
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:46,960
Wake up.

423
00:50:47,043 --> 00:50:50,213
Come on, get up.

424
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:54,259
Come on, get up.

425
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,972
You too. Wake up.

426
00:50:59,055 --> 00:51:00,724
Get up.

427
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:03,268
I said get up!

428
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:06,396
Can you push me?

429
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,154
Push me.

430
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:17,449
Please? Do it.

431
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:20,452
Just push me.

432
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:25,332
It'll be done at once.

433
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:28,794
Push me. Please?

434
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:32,964
Just push me!

435
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:36,885
I can get rid of the baby this way.
Come on.

436
00:51:39,095 --> 00:51:41,139
Please push me.

437
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:45,101
Just push me.

438
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:52,192
Push me so that I can get rid of the baby!

439
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,654
-Fuck!
-Hey, you son of a bitch!

440
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,658
You son of a bitch, do you want to die?

441
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:01,284
You son of a bitch!

442
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:04,162
Are you crazy? Are you really
out of your mind, you motherfucker?

443
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:05,914
Hey. Hey!

444
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:08,834
Pull yourself together, you fucker.

445
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:11,586
Are you all right, Sejin?

446
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:22,097
Did I do that?

447
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,726
Hey, did I really do that to her?

448
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:33,108
Shit. I don't fucking remember a thing.

449
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:36,444
Damn it.

450
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:44,452
There's a guy I know in Uijeongbu.

451
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,788
Let's go and ask him.

452
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:53,628
Let's go to Uijeongbu.

453
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:41,593
No. They are roses. Yes.

454
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:43,011
In full bloom.

455
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:48,016
Isn't it tempting?

456
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:52,187
Okay. I told you I got it.

457
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:54,481
Okay.

458
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:03,281
What are you doing? Let's have a drink.

459
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:15,794
Thank you.

460
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,973
Sejin.

461
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:35,313
I'm helping you because I feel bad
for you. You know that, right?

462
00:54:36,272 --> 00:54:38,441
So work hard,

463
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:41,820
earn the money,
and have the operation you need.

464
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,615
Pull yourself together
and let's hit a grand slam.

465
00:54:46,282 --> 00:54:48,618
Okay?

466
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:52,831
Hey, why didn't you tell us
about this already?

467
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:56,126
Sir, let me pour you a glass.

468
00:54:58,503 --> 00:55:00,255
You're an interesting one, aren't you?

469
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:07,762
Damn. It's really easy this way.

470
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:08,972
Really easy.

471
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:13,685
Hey… Can we

472
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:16,980
drink soju instead?

473
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,734
Eat and drink whatever you want.

474
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:23,945
I'll bring some soju for you.
Anything else?

475
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:25,697
Thank you.

476
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:29,534
Let me take a photo of you two.

477
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:03,359
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

478
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:12,035
Hey.

479
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:15,997
Can I have a cigarette?

480
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:35,433
Hey.

481
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:09,300
That's for you.

482
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:18,685
Hey, I only have ten more left.

483
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:26,693
Ten more to go and then it's over.

484
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:29,487
Cheers.

485
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:31,739
-Let's do it too.
-Cheers.

486
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:33,199
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

487
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:39,956
-Hey.
-Yes?

488
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:41,040
You really came.

489
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,250
Of course.

490
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:46,129
By the way, what do you do for a living?

491
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:47,297
Why?

492
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:49,841
To be honest, I need some money.

493
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,344
I'm pregnant.
So I need to have an operation

494
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:54,554
to get rid of the baby.

495
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:56,347
You're pregnant?

496
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:58,600
How did that happen?

497
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:00,727
Hey, why would you pay money
and get rid of it?

498
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:03,146
Just give birth to a baby boy.
I'll raise him.

499
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:06,566
Wow, this is crazy.

500
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:10,028
Hey, play my favorite song.

501
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:12,906
-I want to sing.
-Sing? What the fuck?

502
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:14,949
What was the number?

503
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:17,535
Was it 4818?

504
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:20,246
This is a legit song.

505
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:27,128
God, it's been a while.

506
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:33,927
Jeongsik, it's been quite a while.

507
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:37,805
Let's get wasted tonight.

508
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:39,098
Go ahead.

509
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:50,276
What is it?

510
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:06,918
That's for introducing them to me.

511
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:11,047
Hey, you guys need to
earn some proper money, right?

512
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:14,467
Let's be honest.
Do they mean something to you?

513
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:17,387
Did you fuck them or something?

514
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:21,724
To be blunt, even if you did,

515
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:24,686
do you have to take responsibility
for their lives?

516
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:27,230
That's not how the world works.

517
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:30,483
I've told you many times, Jaepil.

518
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:34,862
You need to be able to throw away
the thing you picked up on the street.

519
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:38,116
-Life is not that easy--
-Fuck. I told you it's not like that!

520
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:40,535
How many times do I have
to tell you, you motherfucker?

521
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:44,080
Where are the girls? I'm taking them.

522
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,125
Sit up.

523
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:50,712
Sit up.

524
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:52,755
Sit up straight.

525
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:54,549
Sit up straight right now.

526
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:58,553
I told you, they don't
belong to you anymore, you little shit.

527
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:02,724
You think it's unfair?

528
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,019
You grew attached to them
while you were fucking them?

529
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:28,249
You understand?
You and I both made money. Okay?

530
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:31,544
Got it? You and I both did.

531
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:34,172
Nice and clean. Okay?

532
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:37,050
It's fucking nice and clean, right?

533
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:40,970
You son of a bitch!

534
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:44,891
You should listen to me.

535
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:50,438
Okay, Jaepil? I might really kill you
if you act like this.

536
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:13,252
Well,

537
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:17,006
I have something to report.

538
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:23,763
I think they've hired minors.

539
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:34,565
It's a karaoke bar.

540
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:40,738
Please hurry over.

541
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:45,910
Hurry and come up.

542
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:57,672
What are you waiting for? Get in the car.

543
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:26,993
-Sir, where's my sister?
-What's the matter?

544
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:29,662
-Who's your sister?
-Where is she?

545
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:32,165
What's your sister's name?

546
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:33,624
It's Yoon Sejin.

547
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,836
Did you come here alone?
Are you her guardian?

548
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:38,546
Sit down.

549
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:40,798
Come on. Sit down.

550
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,093
Please let me meet my sister.

551
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:46,512
What about your parents? Any adults?

552
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:48,890
But you're a minor. It won't work.

553
01:02:48,973 --> 01:02:52,143
Can you contact anyone you know?

554
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:53,853
-You need to bring an adult.
-I'm her guardian!

555
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:57,064
-You can't meet her now.
-I'm her guardian!

556
01:02:57,148 --> 01:03:01,027
-That's not how it works.
-I'm her guardian from now on.

557
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:03,613
Don't cry. Calm down.

558
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:05,490
You can't meet her now.

559
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:09,243
-Crying doesn't solve anything.
-There's really no one else.

560
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:10,620
You can't meet her now.

561
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:12,997
I'm her only guardian.

562
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:16,334
-Calm down now.
-I'm her guardian.

563
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:18,002
Go home for today.

564
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:21,672
I have to meet her today.

565
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:25,092
-You can't meet her now.
-Please let me see her just once!

566
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:51,035
-It's dirty.
-You have nail clippers?

567
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:52,495
Of course not.

568
01:03:52,578 --> 01:03:54,038
They're so dirty. Look.

569
01:03:54,121 --> 01:03:55,873
Are you two really going to be like this?

570
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:57,500
-Don't.
-And yours are clean.

571
01:03:57,583 --> 01:04:01,379
Even if you show some regret,
it'll still be hard to get out of here.

572
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:04,298
Oh, my.

573
01:04:05,299 --> 01:04:08,261
Sir, I'm reporting what you did to me.

574
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:16,853
I'm trying so hard to give you
another chance for your sister's sake.

575
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:21,148
Are you really going to be like this?

576
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,277
We'll be the same when we're released.

577
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:32,577
Are you not worried about your sister?
She's all alone outside.

578
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:35,663
What the hell is the problem?

579
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:39,834
As long as those kinds of men
are in the world,

580
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:41,460
we'll be forced to live like this.

581
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:47,133
We've got to work to stay alive too…

582
01:04:52,805 --> 01:04:53,931
Get up.

583
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:56,142
Get up.

584
01:04:58,269 --> 01:04:59,562
Get out.

585
01:07:49,857 --> 01:07:51,108
Sejeong.

586
01:07:57,782 --> 01:07:58,949
Sejeong?

587
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:20,221
-Sejeong, come here.
-Are you okay?

588
01:08:20,304 --> 01:08:21,472
What's wrong?

589
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:23,724
Sejeong, come here.

590
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:26,143
Sejeong.

591
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:29,563
Sejeong.

592
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,569
Sejeong.

593
01:08:39,406 --> 01:08:41,158
Sejeong.

594
01:09:01,011 --> 01:09:02,471
You think life's being hard on you?

595
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:10,062
It's only going to get tougher.

596
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:24,994
I was going to come back after a while.

597
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:30,583
But I don't remember it.

598
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:38,632
You know, in my dream…

599
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:45,472
I saw a black snake…

600
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:53,647
That black snake…

601
01:09:57,776 --> 01:09:59,945
That black snake…

602
01:10:02,823 --> 01:10:05,659
was creeping up my leg.

603
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:15,628
Don't forget.

604
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:21,884
No one cares about you.

605
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:27,806
You're a burden.

606
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:32,895
Damn it.

607
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:34,980
Damn it.

608
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:38,525
You trusted adults too!

609
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:39,818
Damn it.

610
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:55,417
Who's that red woman?

611
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:59,380
Why is she in our house?

612
01:10:59,463 --> 01:11:02,007
Tell her to get out.

613
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:04,051
I don't like her.

614
01:11:04,134 --> 01:11:07,429
Tell her to get out.

615
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,234
Have I grown a lot?

616
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:27,574
Yes.

617
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:34,290
You've grown a lot.

618
01:11:40,921 --> 01:11:42,798
Don't trust me.

619
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:50,180
Trust yourself.

620
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:44,777
Hello?

621
01:12:45,277 --> 01:12:46,487
Hi.

622
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:48,989
I asked about it earlier.

623
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,325
Yes.

624
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:53,077
QUESTION ABOUT ABORTION

625
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,829
MY GIRLFRIEND AND I HAVE DECIDED
TO GET AN ABORTION.

626
01:12:55,913 --> 01:12:58,123
PLEASE SHARE ANY INFORMATION
ABOUT ABORTION.

627
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:02,294
Okay, I'll go there myself.

628
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:03,921
Yes.

629
01:13:04,838 --> 01:13:05,881
Okay.

630
01:13:06,507 --> 01:13:08,175
-It's Junghwa-dong…
-Hey.

631
01:13:09,593 --> 01:13:11,261
I'll call you back.

632
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:16,100
I trust you,
but I don't think this is right.

633
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:21,146
Does Sejin know about this?

634
01:13:22,356 --> 01:13:23,816
Are you sure about this?

635
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:42,459
No!

636
01:13:43,043 --> 01:13:44,795
No… Fuck!

637
01:13:55,347 --> 01:13:58,851
MOTORCYCLE SHOP

638
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:04,940
Here.

639
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:18,245
Tomorrow…

640
01:14:20,164 --> 01:14:21,290
Are you not scared?

641
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:26,211
After you get surgery…

642
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:30,257
do whatever you want.

643
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:44,391
Ms. Yoon Sejin.

644
01:16:50,647 --> 01:16:53,191
Congratulations. You're pregnant.

645
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:56,820
All right. You're the father, right?

646
01:16:58,363 --> 01:17:02,159
I can see that this is
your first time coming to the hospital.

647
01:17:02,242 --> 01:17:04,828
It's a little late, but it's okay.

648
01:17:04,911 --> 01:17:07,080
If you take good care of yourself
from now on…

649
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:09,458
Am I going to have an operation today?

650
01:17:12,544 --> 01:17:14,087
What operation?

651
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:17,341
I came here to have an operation.

652
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:23,305
Are you not here
for the first examination?

653
01:17:23,388 --> 01:17:26,308
I heard I can have the operation today.

654
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:30,479
I see…

655
01:17:35,108 --> 01:17:38,945
I'm sorry, but we don't provide
that kind of operation.

656
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:42,157
And…

657
01:17:44,409 --> 01:17:48,622
I think you're still quite young.

658
01:17:48,705 --> 01:17:51,458
When you're still growing, that kind
of operation is really bad for you.

659
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:53,835
Okay?

660
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:58,423
Even though you can't see it,
the baby is breathing

661
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:02,636
and it's getting enough nutrients
from the mother's diet.

662
01:18:03,637 --> 01:18:05,847
It's just like the mother.

663
01:18:09,768 --> 01:18:12,521
Right. How about this
if it's too hard for you?

664
01:18:14,147 --> 01:18:15,440
Where did I put it?

665
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:21,988
SHELTER FOR SINGLE MOTHERS
WE WILL HELP YOU START A NEW LIFE

666
01:18:22,072 --> 01:18:23,990
How about you get some help?

667
01:18:35,585 --> 01:18:36,920
Where are you calling?

668
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:39,297
They're not answering.

669
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,051
Hey.

670
01:18:49,015 --> 01:18:50,684
If you're sorry, just say it.

671
01:19:17,836 --> 01:19:19,087
Gosh.

672
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:25,302
Sejin.

673
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:28,513
Long time no see.

674
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:30,390
Have you been doing well?

675
01:19:31,641 --> 01:19:32,893
I need money.

676
01:19:36,563 --> 01:19:38,940
Stop asking for money.

677
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:45,322
Did you have the operation?

678
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:57,209
I was going to call you anyway.

679
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:02,172
You know something?

680
01:20:04,966 --> 01:20:08,428
You know the day we were fucked.
Remember when the police raided here?

681
01:20:09,387 --> 01:20:10,764
It turned out

682
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:15,393
that fucker, Jaepil, was the one
who reported it.

683
01:20:16,728 --> 01:20:20,065
And he also took the money I gave him

684
01:20:20,774 --> 01:20:22,943
for introducing you and Juyeong to me.

685
01:20:23,693 --> 01:20:24,820
Did you know that?

686
01:20:27,781 --> 01:20:29,574
Yes. He told me.

687
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:36,373
Wow, Jaepil is quite loyal to his friends.

688
01:20:36,456 --> 01:20:39,167
I got scammed, so I need money.

689
01:20:40,043 --> 01:20:41,336
Let me work here.

690
01:20:41,419 --> 01:20:42,754
Was it Jaepil?

691
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:44,840
No.

692
01:20:45,799 --> 01:20:48,385
What did you expect from him?

693
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:51,638
That's how he is.

694
01:20:53,473 --> 01:20:56,518
KARAOKE BAR

695
01:20:59,187 --> 01:21:00,230
Hey…

696
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:42,063
What the fuck?

697
01:21:42,606 --> 01:21:43,940
Why did you cut the song?

698
01:21:45,275 --> 01:21:47,277
Why the fuck did you do that?

699
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:49,988
Damn it.

700
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:53,950
I went to the karaoke bar in Uijeongbu.

701
01:21:55,869 --> 01:21:57,162
I met Junseok.

702
01:22:00,999 --> 01:22:02,876
He's the last resort.

703
01:22:03,543 --> 01:22:04,753
It's the only option.

704
01:22:06,087 --> 01:22:08,006
Junseok said he'd give me an advance.

705
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:13,428
And he'll find me a hospital.

706
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:18,725
Juyeong, start working there tomorrow.

707
01:22:39,162 --> 01:22:40,747
What's your deal?

708
01:22:42,123 --> 01:22:43,708
He said you're the one who reported it.

709
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:47,295
That's why the police raided there
and we got arrested.

710
01:22:50,882 --> 01:22:52,384
I think it's unfair.

711
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:55,220
Why the fuck is it my fault?

712
01:22:58,181 --> 01:23:02,018
You took the money from him
for introducing Juyeong and me to him.

713
01:23:02,102 --> 01:23:03,228
Am I wrong?

714
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:05,480
Without telling me anything.

715
01:23:06,356 --> 01:23:07,774
You fucked me over.

716
01:23:08,733 --> 01:23:11,152
What was that for?

717
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:13,279
Fuck.

718
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:15,824
This is so annoying.

719
01:23:15,907 --> 01:23:18,326
You're so fucking annoying,
you son of a bitch!

720
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,335
Hey, explain to me right now.

721
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:30,088
Or I'll really kill you.

722
01:23:34,592 --> 01:23:37,053
Tell me why you fucking did it!

723
01:23:54,904 --> 01:23:56,156
I'm sorry.

724
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:01,286
Hey.

725
01:24:02,162 --> 01:24:03,496
Eat that.

726
01:24:06,624 --> 01:24:07,959
You said you're sorry.

727
01:24:09,544 --> 01:24:10,712
I'm sorry.

728
01:24:11,755 --> 01:24:13,381
Eat that.

729
01:24:17,093 --> 01:24:18,845
Come on, eat it.

730
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:26,644
Here.

731
01:24:28,438 --> 01:24:29,898
I won't throw this.

732
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:32,776
I'll feed you with my hand.

733
01:24:37,572 --> 01:24:38,865
Do you want to feed him?

734
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:43,286
You do it.

735
01:24:45,789 --> 01:24:46,998
Come on.

736
01:24:53,546 --> 01:24:55,965
See what's happening because of you.

737
01:24:58,176 --> 01:24:59,219
You see it?

738
01:25:02,222 --> 01:25:04,432
I became like this because of you.

739
01:25:07,435 --> 01:25:10,522
I'll make it up to you. I'm so sorry.

740
01:25:15,318 --> 01:25:16,486
You're sorry?

741
01:25:18,822 --> 01:25:20,406
Are you really sorry?

742
01:25:21,324 --> 01:25:22,700
I'm not feeling it.

743
01:25:28,039 --> 01:25:29,207
Do it properly.

744
01:25:30,416 --> 01:25:31,668
Beg for forgiveness.

745
01:25:52,063 --> 01:25:55,066
I'm really serious.

746
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:58,027
Yes. I really like her.

747
01:25:58,111 --> 01:25:59,904
I really want to fuck her.

748
01:26:01,114 --> 01:26:02,323
I'm serious.

749
01:26:02,949 --> 01:26:04,492
I'm serious.

750
01:26:05,577 --> 01:26:06,953
What's going on?

751
01:26:07,453 --> 01:26:08,872
What the fuck? Gosh.

752
01:26:08,955 --> 01:26:10,331
You fucking bastard!

753
01:26:16,796 --> 01:26:20,216
You fucking son of a bitch!

754
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:22,844
That motherfucker Jaepil!

755
01:26:48,912 --> 01:26:50,330
Fuck, did you see him earlier?

756
01:26:50,413 --> 01:26:51,915
What's his deal?

757
01:26:51,998 --> 01:26:55,251
Hey, what do we do about Sejin?
Give her a call.

758
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:59,088
She doesn't know where we are.
I have to go somewhere else later.

759
01:26:59,172 --> 01:27:00,924
-No, don't.
-Why?

760
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:04,344
-Don't call her.
-Why?

761
01:27:04,427 --> 01:27:06,971
That bitch needs to learn a lesson!

762
01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:09,224
We're going through fucking shit
because of her.

763
01:27:09,307 --> 01:27:10,558
Why are you worried about her?

764
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:13,102
What the hell are you talking about?

765
01:27:13,186 --> 01:27:15,647
She's mad because Jaepil took
the money and called the police.

766
01:27:16,147 --> 01:27:19,400
That's not it.
We suffered a lot because of him too.

767
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:21,152
-Suffered what?
-What do you know?

768
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:22,612
Fucking idiot.

769
01:27:23,571 --> 01:27:24,948
I heard about everything.

770
01:27:25,031 --> 01:27:26,532
From who? Who?

771
01:27:26,616 --> 01:27:28,243
What the fuck do you know?

772
01:27:28,326 --> 01:27:30,286
You know why we let you tag along?

773
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:31,496
"Tag along"?

774
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:33,414
Fucking "tag along"?

775
01:27:33,498 --> 01:27:36,042
Then what? Are you letting us tag along?

776
01:27:41,839 --> 01:27:43,925
Hey, you're ridiculous.

777
01:27:44,717 --> 01:27:47,637
Do you think we took the fucking money
just for our sake?

778
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:49,347
Yes. It was for your sake.

779
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:51,891
Do you think
I don't know what you're up to?

780
01:27:51,975 --> 01:27:55,186
Why do you think we didn't ditch you?
Why do you think we brought you here?

781
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:58,022
-I don't know.
-See? You don't know a fucking thing.

782
01:27:58,106 --> 01:28:00,358
I told you I heard about it, you idiot.

783
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:03,152
If it were you, wouldn't you get mad?

784
01:28:03,236 --> 01:28:05,321
She thinks you fucking sold us for money.

785
01:28:05,405 --> 01:28:09,075
-I told you we'd share the money.
-That's bullshit. When did you say that?

786
01:28:09,158 --> 01:28:11,661
-When the fuck was that? When?
-I don't know the fuck. I don't have it.

787
01:28:11,744 --> 01:28:14,956
-Don't you have it, asshole?
-You're clueless as fuck, aren't you?

788
01:28:15,039 --> 01:28:16,291
Do you think I'm a fucking idiot?

789
01:28:17,083 --> 01:28:18,543
Watch what you say, you shit.

790
01:28:18,626 --> 01:28:21,129
Fuck off. It's my mouth.
Why should I watch what I say?

791
01:28:21,212 --> 01:28:22,714
-Stop fucking with me.
-Fuck off.

792
01:28:22,797 --> 01:28:24,173
-Stop it.
-Fuck off.

793
01:28:24,257 --> 01:28:25,425
-Stop it.
-Fuck off.

794
01:28:25,508 --> 01:28:26,968
I told you to stop it.

795
01:28:27,051 --> 01:28:28,052
-Fuck off.
-Fuck!

796
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:29,220
-Shit!
-Get up.

797
01:28:30,805 --> 01:28:31,889
Get up.

798
01:28:35,268 --> 01:28:36,269
Get up.

799
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:46,738
Raise your head. Raise it!

800
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:48,906
Hey, raise your head.

801
01:28:51,576 --> 01:28:53,536
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

802
01:28:54,746 --> 01:28:55,788
You're sorry?

803
01:28:57,373 --> 01:28:58,666
What are you sorry for?

804
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:00,043
What for?

805
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:02,879
What are you sorry for? Tell me.

806
01:29:03,379 --> 01:29:06,758
Hey, what are you sorry for? What for?

807
01:29:12,013 --> 01:29:15,767
You fucker. I accepted you
when you had nowhere to go.

808
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:19,562
You look for me only when you need me?

809
01:29:20,563 --> 01:29:22,190
Get your shit together. Okay?

810
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:28,071
Get up.

811
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:31,532
On your knees.

812
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:33,743
On your knees. You shit!

813
01:29:34,660 --> 01:29:35,745
You motherfucker.

814
01:29:42,919 --> 01:29:43,961
Hey.

815
01:29:49,884 --> 01:29:51,052
You fucking asshole.

816
01:29:52,178 --> 01:29:55,098
Didn't I fucking tell you?

817
01:29:55,181 --> 01:29:57,308
You never listened to your mom
when you were a kid.

818
01:29:57,391 --> 01:29:59,143
Now you don't listen to me either?

819
01:29:59,227 --> 01:30:03,397
You think I'm a fucking idiot?
Is that what you think?

820
01:30:10,154 --> 01:30:11,697
Hey, face down.

821
01:30:12,573 --> 01:30:14,033
Don't move.

822
01:31:08,546 --> 01:31:09,630
Sejin!

823
01:31:10,173 --> 01:31:11,465
Yoon Sejin!

824
01:31:13,467 --> 01:31:15,261
You fucking bitch!

825
01:31:15,845 --> 01:31:20,600
-Why do we have to go through the fuck?
-Let go of me!

826
01:31:20,683 --> 01:31:22,685
-Let go of me!
-You fucking bitch. Seriously.

827
01:31:22,768 --> 01:31:26,397
-Why?
-Don't fucking touch me. Let go of me!

828
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:29,567
Fuck. Let go of me. Let go!

829
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:30,860
-Fuck!
-Come with me, bitch.

830
01:31:30,943 --> 01:31:32,278
Don't move.

831
01:31:32,361 --> 01:31:34,447
-You fucking bitch.
-Fuck!

832
01:31:40,494 --> 01:31:41,662
Fuck!

833
01:31:43,915 --> 01:31:45,291
You son of a bitch.

834
01:31:48,002 --> 01:31:50,838
If you touch me again, I'll kill you.

835
01:32:06,938 --> 01:32:11,275
How much do we have to be fucked,
just so you could be happy?

836
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:14,445
Get up! Get up, you fucking bitch!

837
01:32:14,528 --> 01:32:18,491
Get up! Now!

838
01:32:18,574 --> 01:32:21,994
Get up! I said get up!

839
01:32:22,078 --> 01:32:25,081
Fuck! How much do we have to be fucked,
just so you could be happy?

840
01:32:25,164 --> 01:32:27,625
Get up!

841
01:32:28,251 --> 01:32:30,211
You son of a bitch!

842
01:33:45,786 --> 01:33:46,871
Hold this.

843
01:33:51,917 --> 01:33:53,252
Hold it, Juyeong!

844
01:33:56,630 --> 01:33:57,715
Hold it.

845
01:34:03,596 --> 01:34:04,597
Smack her.

846
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:11,020
Hold it, Juyeong.

847
01:34:14,148 --> 01:34:15,274
Now…

848
01:34:17,526 --> 01:34:18,652
hit her.

849
01:34:21,906 --> 01:34:23,115
Hold it.

850
01:34:23,866 --> 01:34:25,159
Hold it.

851
01:34:30,581 --> 01:34:31,749
Hold it.

852
01:34:39,256 --> 01:34:40,341
Hold it.

853
01:34:45,388 --> 01:34:47,515
It's our fault.

854
01:34:47,598 --> 01:34:49,141
It's all our fault.

855
01:34:49,809 --> 01:34:52,353
We'll never do that again. Never.

856
01:34:52,436 --> 01:34:54,772
Please give us one more chance.

857
01:34:56,315 --> 01:34:58,776
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

858
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:11,163
I'll hit her. Give it to me!

859
01:35:12,164 --> 01:35:13,207
Give it to me.

860
01:35:13,999 --> 01:35:15,668
Hit her.

861
01:35:24,510 --> 01:35:25,636
Do it.

862
01:35:35,771 --> 01:35:36,856
Smack her.

863
01:35:43,362 --> 01:35:44,405
Smack…

864
01:35:46,115 --> 01:35:47,199
Smack her.

865
01:35:50,494 --> 01:35:51,537
Smack her.

866
01:35:53,956 --> 01:35:54,999
Smack her.

867
01:36:03,716 --> 01:36:05,050
Smack her now!

868
01:36:06,385 --> 01:36:07,470
Smack harder!

869
01:36:08,554 --> 01:36:09,680
Smack her!

870
01:36:14,727 --> 01:36:15,853
Smack her.

871
01:36:18,230 --> 01:36:21,609
I want to stop. Please let me stop.

872
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:24,653
It hurts.

873
01:36:24,737 --> 01:36:25,863
Smack her.

874
01:36:31,702 --> 01:36:32,870
Do it.

875
01:36:35,289 --> 01:36:36,415
Smack her.

876
01:38:01,333 --> 01:38:04,128
I went to the pharmacy
and bought some medicines.

877
01:39:08,859 --> 01:39:10,027
Eat this.

878
01:39:40,391 --> 01:39:41,767
It's good, right?

879
01:39:41,850 --> 01:39:43,185
Right.

880
01:39:50,401 --> 01:39:51,485
Right.

881
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:04,623
Why are you crying?

882
01:40:29,982 --> 01:40:31,400
It fucking hurts.

883
01:40:40,534 --> 01:40:42,202
Go on. Chew it.

884
01:40:53,547 --> 01:40:54,840
I'm sorry.

885
01:41:00,053 --> 01:41:01,847
I'm the one who should be sorry.

886
01:41:18,197 --> 01:41:19,281
Juyeong.

887
01:41:23,744 --> 01:41:25,746
I messed up everything.

888
01:41:40,344 --> 01:41:41,720
What is that?

889
01:42:03,033 --> 01:42:04,117
Juyeong.

890
01:42:10,082 --> 01:42:11,500
Let's split up now.

891
01:43:40,213 --> 01:43:43,759
SHELTER FOR TEENAGERS

892
01:44:25,676 --> 01:44:27,427
Are you hurt badly?

893
01:44:28,929 --> 01:44:30,639
Your pretty face is all messed up.

894
01:44:37,104 --> 01:44:38,605
It must've really hurt.

895
01:44:41,858 --> 01:44:43,527
I don't do it anymore.

896
01:44:46,029 --> 01:44:48,240
Maybe you and I went
through the same thing.

897
01:44:50,951 --> 01:44:52,119
Sorry.

898
01:44:53,161 --> 01:44:56,081
You know, I feel like I must do something
to help people like you here…

899
01:44:59,084 --> 01:45:01,461
By the way, my name is Ajin.

900
01:45:02,379 --> 01:45:03,463
Ajin.

901
01:45:06,008 --> 01:45:07,884
Feel free to talk to me.

902
01:45:10,137 --> 01:45:12,097
You can tell me anything you want.

903
01:45:16,018 --> 01:45:17,561
What's your name?

904
01:45:20,564 --> 01:45:21,648
Sejin.

905
01:45:29,698 --> 01:45:32,951
Thank you, my Lord,
for letting us meet each other.

906
01:45:33,827 --> 01:45:36,413
You said there's no coincidence
for those who pray.

907
01:45:37,622 --> 01:45:39,666
Did you say it for this moment?

908
01:45:40,667 --> 01:45:43,670
"But he knows the way that I take;

909
01:45:44,588 --> 01:45:48,008
when he has tested me,
I will come forth as gold."

910
01:45:48,592 --> 01:45:51,970
Job 23:10. Amen.

911
01:45:58,143 --> 01:45:59,352
Sejin!

912
01:46:28,090 --> 01:46:30,592
Just think of them as your uncle and aunt.

913
01:46:30,675 --> 01:46:32,719
You can be comfortable around them.

914
01:46:36,723 --> 01:46:38,391
Do you want some juice?

915
01:46:38,475 --> 01:46:41,478
Do you want to drink anything else?

916
01:46:42,145 --> 01:46:44,689
Why don't you have some juice or milk?

917
01:46:46,441 --> 01:46:47,859
It's been really hard, hasn't it?

918
01:46:51,113 --> 01:46:52,322
Thank you.

919
01:46:57,244 --> 01:46:59,121
Does it still hurt?

920
01:47:35,657 --> 01:47:37,576
I put organic apples, carrots

921
01:47:37,659 --> 01:47:40,495
and some yogurt to make it easy to drink.

922
01:47:45,625 --> 01:47:48,962
The weather is nice today.
Is there anything you want to eat?

923
01:47:49,546 --> 01:47:51,798
How about we eat out
after going to the hospital?

924
01:48:03,894 --> 01:48:06,771
When you exhale, your legs should go down.

925
01:48:08,899 --> 01:48:10,942
Let your legs go down
after taking a breath.

926
01:48:22,913 --> 01:48:24,706
How old is your baby?

927
01:48:25,582 --> 01:48:27,042
Nine months old.

928
01:48:28,752 --> 01:48:31,254
"Yes. Hello."

929
01:48:33,423 --> 01:48:37,844
Simple exercises are really helpful.
Slowly and little by little.

930
01:48:37,928 --> 01:48:39,346
But you shouldn't overdo yourself.

931
01:48:39,429 --> 01:48:42,724
She's been doing yoga regularly,
as you told us last time.

932
01:48:42,807 --> 01:48:44,226
That's great.

933
01:48:44,309 --> 01:48:48,104
The baby is healthy, right?

934
01:48:48,855 --> 01:48:52,692
Since the mother is healthy,
the baby is too.

935
01:48:54,152 --> 01:48:55,445
Thank you, Doctor.

936
01:48:56,446 --> 01:48:58,698
They're caring a lot about you.

937
01:48:58,782 --> 01:49:00,408
You must be relieved.

938
01:50:17,110 --> 01:50:18,695
It's your first time seeing this, right?

939
01:50:23,033 --> 01:50:26,536
These are silk threads.

940
01:50:27,912 --> 01:50:29,914
These threads are long and tough.

941
01:50:31,458 --> 01:50:35,962
So people keep them, praying for
a newborn baby's long and healthy life.

942
01:50:40,300 --> 01:50:41,426
Normally…

943
01:50:44,220 --> 01:50:46,264
these are supposed to be given to the baby

944
01:50:47,724 --> 01:50:49,476
in a 100-day celebration.

945
01:50:59,444 --> 01:51:00,779
But then,

946
01:51:02,530 --> 01:51:04,366
you won't be able to see your baby.

947
01:51:07,994 --> 01:51:09,079
So,

948
01:51:10,663 --> 01:51:12,916
let's make a bracelet with these threads

949
01:51:12,999 --> 01:51:14,709
and give it to the baby as a gift.

950
01:51:17,212 --> 01:51:18,421
Let's make ours too.

951
01:51:48,243 --> 01:51:50,036
It's similar to how you braid your hair.

952
01:52:18,898 --> 01:52:21,067
PREGNANCY JOURNAL
YOON SEJIN

953
01:54:24,691 --> 01:54:26,067
<i>Are you doing well?</i>

954
01:54:28,069 --> 01:54:31,322
<i>How did it go? Did it go well?</i>

955
01:54:47,589 --> 01:54:49,007
I miss you.

956
01:54:52,176 --> 01:54:53,928
<i>I miss you too.</i>

957
01:54:56,264 --> 01:54:59,183
<i>I learned how to make kimchi fried rice.</i>

958
01:55:00,268 --> 01:55:04,689
<i>You need some butter,</i>
<i>canned tuna, kimchi and ham.</i>

959
01:55:04,772 --> 01:55:08,192
<i>It's really good.</i>
<i>Come home so I can make you some.</i>

960
01:55:09,903 --> 01:55:11,654
<i>By the way, did it go well?</i>

961
01:55:58,242 --> 01:55:59,869
Tell her to sleep in her room.

962
01:55:59,953 --> 01:56:01,829
How could I? She's sound asleep.

963
01:56:07,835 --> 01:56:09,003
Sejin?

964
01:56:11,839 --> 01:56:13,049
Sejin.

965
01:56:18,429 --> 01:56:19,931
Why don't you go sleep in your room?

966
01:59:40,548 --> 01:59:42,258
Sejin, do you recognize me?

967
01:59:46,012 --> 01:59:47,597
Your operation went well.

968
01:59:48,681 --> 01:59:50,391
We'll move you to the recovery room now.

969
01:59:51,809 --> 01:59:52,977
So don't worry, okay?

970
01:59:59,525 --> 02:00:03,988
If you got here late, she might have died.

971
02:00:06,449 --> 02:00:09,869
We successfully removed the fetus
from her womb.

972
02:00:12,872 --> 02:00:15,708
But seriously, it was
really dangerous for the mother.

973
02:00:17,877 --> 02:00:21,714
Still, her operation went well.

974
02:04:01,225 --> 02:04:03,894
THIS FILM IS DEDICATED
TO THE LATE LEE SEUL-CHAN.
