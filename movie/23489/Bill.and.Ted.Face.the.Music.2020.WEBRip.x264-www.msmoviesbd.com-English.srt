00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:37,128
<i>Ready, T.</i>

3
00:00:37,194 --> 00:00:38,662
<i>Okay.</i>

4
00:00:38,728 --> 00:00:41,631
<i>This is the story of
our most excellent dads.</i>

5
00:00:41,698 --> 00:00:45,102
I'm Bill S. Preston, Esquire.

6
00:00:45,168 --> 00:00:47,704
And I'm Ted "Theodore" Logan.

7
00:00:48,604 --> 00:00:51,507
And we're Wyld Stallyns!

8
00:00:51,575 --> 00:00:54,412
<i>This was probably
the first time you saw 'em.</i>

9
00:00:55,279 --> 00:00:57,347
Let's rock!

10
00:00:58,414 --> 00:01:01,384
<i>And this
was probably the last.</i>

11
00:01:01,451 --> 00:01:03,386
<i>Not long
before we were born,</i>

12
00:01:03,453 --> 00:01:05,088
<i>they were told
they were gonna write a song</i>

13
00:01:05,156 --> 00:01:08,392
<i>that was gonna
unite the entire world.</i>

14
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:09,692
<i>Which they thought
they had done</i>

15
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,195
<i>with their hit single...</i>

16
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,496
Those Who Rock.

17
00:01:13,563 --> 00:01:16,332
<i>Not only did it not
unite the world,</i>

18
00:01:17,468 --> 00:01:19,370
<i>but the band fell apart.</i>

19
00:01:19,436 --> 00:01:24,008
<i>And our dads, alone now,
were trying harder and harder.</i>

20
00:01:24,075 --> 00:01:26,844
<i>But the problem was,
the harder Dads tried...</i>

21
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:28,311
<i>The less interested</i>

22
00:01:28,378 --> 00:01:30,713
<i>people seemed to be
in their music.</i>

23
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:34,418
<i>Not only was it wearing
on them and on the family...</i>

24
00:01:34,484 --> 00:01:36,052
<i>But the universe
they were told</i>

25
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,822
<i>they were gonna
bring together...</i>

26
00:01:37,888 --> 00:01:40,057
<i>Was actually
starting to unravel.</i>

27
00:01:40,123 --> 00:01:43,227
<i>Yeah,
time was folding in on itself.</i>

28
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:45,295
<i>It was bad.</i>

29
00:01:45,361 --> 00:01:46,396
What, what?

30
00:01:46,462 --> 00:01:47,563
<i>Totally, dude.</i>

31
00:01:47,631 --> 00:01:48,765
Make some noise!

32
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:56,106
<i>Anyways, this is how
we got to where we are now.</i>

33
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,746
Hello,
friends and loved ones.

34
00:02:02,813 --> 00:02:04,781
Let us welcome you,
one and all

35
00:02:04,847 --> 00:02:07,951
to this
most joyous of occasions!

36
00:02:12,288 --> 00:02:14,890
Ted and I have known Missy
in different capacities

37
00:02:14,957 --> 00:02:16,860
for many decades.

38
00:02:16,926 --> 00:02:19,695
First, she was our babysitter
when we were ten.

39
00:02:19,763 --> 00:02:21,865
Then we both invited her
to the prom

40
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:23,966
when she was a senior
and we were freshmen.

41
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:25,269
Yeah!

42
00:02:25,335 --> 00:02:27,671
Two years later,
she married my dad

43
00:02:27,736 --> 00:02:29,606
and Missy became Mom.

44
00:02:29,673 --> 00:02:33,376
After divorcing Bill's dad,
she married my dad

45
00:02:33,443 --> 00:02:35,145
and became my mom.

46
00:02:35,211 --> 00:02:36,478
Yeah.

47
00:02:36,545 --> 00:02:38,414
And now she's marrying
Ted's little brother,

48
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,483
Officer Deacon Logan.

49
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:45,956
Yeah.

50
00:02:46,522 --> 00:02:48,359
Missy, Bill and I,

51
00:02:48,425 --> 00:02:50,961
along with my beautiful wife,
Elizabeth,

52
00:02:51,027 --> 00:02:52,661
and our daughter, Billie...

53
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:57,434
And my beautiful wife, Joanna,
and our daughter, Thea,

54
00:02:57,501 --> 00:02:59,536
all wanna welcome you back...

55
00:02:59,602 --> 00:03:01,472
With open arms.

56
00:03:04,441 --> 00:03:05,908
This happy event
would seem to make

57
00:03:05,975 --> 00:03:07,677
Deacon his own father-in-law

58
00:03:07,743 --> 00:03:09,180
and Ted his own uncle.

59
00:03:09,246 --> 00:03:12,983
Not to mention making my dad
his own son.

60
00:03:14,616 --> 00:03:16,119
And with that
beautiful thought in mind,

61
00:03:16,186 --> 00:03:17,754
for your first dance,

62
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,824
we wish to present you
with a matrimonial offering.

63
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,691
A sneak peek
at the world premiere

64
00:03:22,758 --> 00:03:24,460
of our newest sonic creation.

65
00:03:24,527 --> 00:03:26,162
We're not sure
if this is going to be

66
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:28,131
the song
that unites the world.

67
00:03:28,198 --> 00:03:29,599
We're pretty sure it might.

68
00:03:29,665 --> 00:03:32,468
- At least we hope.
- Yeah.

69
00:03:38,908 --> 00:03:43,146
Sure to be another real doozy
from the Wyld Stallyns.

70
00:03:43,212 --> 00:03:44,513
Check one, two.

71
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,649
Let's dance,
Freaky Deaky.

72
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,288
You got it, Kissy Missy.

73
00:03:52,354 --> 00:03:54,657
Oh, shh.
Your dad used to call me that.

74
00:03:54,724 --> 00:03:56,192
Totally aware of that, babe.

75
00:03:56,258 --> 00:03:58,961
Please enjoy the first
three movements of...

76
00:03:59,028 --> 00:04:01,497
<i>That Which
Binds Us Through Time...</i>

77
00:04:01,564 --> 00:04:06,736
<i>The Chemical, Physical, and
Biological Nature of Love...</i>

78
00:04:06,802 --> 00:04:11,307
<i>An Exploration of
the Meaning of Meaning.</i>

79
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,509
<i>Part One.</i>

80
00:04:17,781 --> 00:04:20,750
- Ready, Bill?
- Ready, Ted.

81
00:04:20,817 --> 00:04:22,084
- One.
- Two.

82
00:04:22,151 --> 00:04:24,254
One, two, three, four.

83
00:05:22,178 --> 00:05:24,347
Dad, I've told you
a thousand times,

84
00:05:24,415 --> 00:05:26,617
Bill and I
have to keep going till...

85
00:05:26,682 --> 00:05:29,519
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Till your
music unites the world.

86
00:05:29,586 --> 00:05:32,422
Chief Logan, the people
in the future told us...

87
00:05:32,488 --> 00:05:33,789
Bill, Bill, Bill,
you didn't time-travel.

88
00:05:33,857 --> 00:05:35,259
We did.

89
00:05:35,324 --> 00:05:36,894
Your wives
aren't from medieval England.

90
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,361
They are.

91
00:05:38,427 --> 00:05:39,362
And you didn't go
to Heaven and Hell.

92
00:05:39,428 --> 00:05:40,396
We did!

93
00:05:40,463 --> 00:05:41,497
- You didn't!
- We did!

94
00:05:41,564 --> 00:05:42,764
And you know why?

95
00:05:42,831 --> 00:05:46,336
Because it's impossible.

96
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:48,971
Here's a real idea
for you two.

97
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:50,473
Here it comes, dude.

98
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,309
Get real jobs.

99
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:55,111
Be role models
to your daughters.

100
00:05:55,177 --> 00:05:56,945
Oh, never mind.

101
00:05:57,012 --> 00:05:58,180
You are.

102
00:05:58,247 --> 00:06:00,149
They're 24,
they live at home

103
00:06:00,216 --> 00:06:01,984
and they're unemployed.

104
00:06:02,052 --> 00:06:03,754
You remember
when you used to call them

105
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,055
"Little Bill," "Little Ted"?

106
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,789
We thought
it was cute, Gramps.

107
00:06:06,855 --> 00:06:08,190
Hey.

108
00:06:08,257 --> 00:06:10,159
Yeah. Well, it turned out
to be a curse.

109
00:06:10,226 --> 00:06:13,362
All I ever see them do is
sit around, listen to music.

110
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,930
That is our primary activity,

111
00:06:14,997 --> 00:06:16,432
- definitely.
- Yeah.

112
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,567
You guys okay?

113
00:06:17,634 --> 00:06:19,169
Joanna, Elizabeth,

114
00:06:19,235 --> 00:06:20,870
how do you feel about being

115
00:06:20,937 --> 00:06:22,872
the only adults
in your families?

116
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:26,910
The only ones
with actual jobs?

117
00:06:26,976 --> 00:06:28,411
Let's pack up.

118
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:30,579
- Don't listen to him.
- Ouch.

119
00:06:31,447 --> 00:06:33,348
I really appreciate you
doing this.

120
00:06:33,415 --> 00:06:34,783
I know it wasn't your choice.

121
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,286
Of course, Jo.

122
00:06:36,353 --> 00:06:37,920
I really want this
to work for both of us.

123
00:06:37,987 --> 00:06:39,422
Yeah.

124
00:06:39,488 --> 00:06:41,057
Oh, hey.

125
00:06:41,124 --> 00:06:42,492
How's it goin', dude?

126
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:43,594
Good, dude.

127
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,795
- Hi!
- Hey, Jo.

128
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,129
Oh, no, no.

129
00:06:46,196 --> 00:06:47,797
I'm sorry,
is this the right day?

130
00:06:47,863 --> 00:06:49,599
Yeah, totally.

131
00:06:49,665 --> 00:06:52,735
So, do you understand
why this situation

132
00:06:52,802 --> 00:06:56,173
might seem at all strange
to your wives?

133
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,742
No. Not at all.
Why?

134
00:06:58,809 --> 00:07:02,445
Well, when your wives
suggested couples therapy,

135
00:07:02,512 --> 00:07:05,482
do you think that this is
what they had in mind?

136
00:07:05,548 --> 00:07:06,782
Well, definitely.

137
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,052
I mean, we're
a couple of couples, right?

138
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:10,520
- That is true.
- Yeah.

139
00:07:10,586 --> 00:07:13,689
But usually,
with couples therapy,

140
00:07:13,755 --> 00:07:14,957
it just means one couple.

141
00:07:15,024 --> 00:07:16,125
That makes sense.

142
00:07:16,192 --> 00:07:17,627
Yeah.

143
00:07:17,694 --> 00:07:19,194
Well, but, you know,
we're here,

144
00:07:19,262 --> 00:07:20,697
so let's work with that.

145
00:07:20,764 --> 00:07:21,898
- Yes?
- Yeah.

146
00:07:21,964 --> 00:07:23,532
Okay, great.

147
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
Um...

148
00:07:24,668 --> 00:07:26,903
Ted, is there something
you feel

149
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,805
your wife needs to hear
from you?

150
00:07:28,872 --> 00:07:31,074
Yeah. Totally.

151
00:07:32,742 --> 00:07:34,811
We love you guys.

152
00:07:34,877 --> 00:07:37,546
Ah, that is good, dude.

153
00:07:38,081 --> 00:07:39,415
In a way, yes.

154
00:07:39,482 --> 00:07:42,119
I mean,
it is great to feel loved.

155
00:07:42,185 --> 00:07:44,454
But do you understand

156
00:07:44,521 --> 00:07:47,390
how that might sound strange
to your wives?

157
00:07:47,456 --> 00:07:49,293
I'll shoot this at Bill.

158
00:07:50,026 --> 00:07:51,026
No.

159
00:07:51,093 --> 00:07:52,295
I mean, we love 'em.

160
00:07:52,362 --> 00:07:54,164
Oh. "We love them."

161
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,932
- Yeah.
- Yeah. We do.

162
00:07:55,997 --> 00:07:58,300
Okay. It's the "we" part.

163
00:07:58,367 --> 00:08:01,404
Um... Ted, can you say
the same thing,

164
00:08:01,471 --> 00:08:05,274
but instead of "we,"
say "I" in the sentence.

165
00:08:05,341 --> 00:08:07,877
- Oh. Yeah.
- Okay.

166
00:08:07,944 --> 00:08:09,446
Of course.

167
00:08:09,512 --> 00:08:10,447
Okay.

168
00:08:10,512 --> 00:08:11,981
- Elizabeth?
- Yes.

169
00:08:12,048 --> 00:08:15,185
I and Bill love you
and Joanna.

170
00:08:15,252 --> 00:08:16,552
Okay.

171
00:08:16,619 --> 00:08:18,222
Dude,
with all due respect,

172
00:08:18,288 --> 00:08:19,523
I don't think
you're quite getting this.

173
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:20,923
Go for it, dude.

174
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:21,990
Okay.

175
00:08:22,057 --> 00:08:23,259
I'm gonna do one.

176
00:08:23,326 --> 00:08:25,195
Yes, go for it, dude.

177
00:08:25,261 --> 00:08:26,897
- Great.
- Okay.

178
00:08:30,466 --> 00:08:32,101
- Joanna?
- Mmm-hmm?

179
00:08:32,168 --> 00:08:35,038
From the very,
very bottom of I

180
00:08:35,105 --> 00:08:37,440
and Ted's hearts,

181
00:08:37,506 --> 00:08:43,211
I and Ted
totally love and worship you

182
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:44,914
and Elizabeth.

183
00:08:46,716 --> 00:08:47,783
Perfect, dude.

184
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,753
Ah, awesome, dude, thanks.

185
00:08:50,854 --> 00:08:56,360
Joanna, would you or Elizabeth
like to respond to that?

186
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,861
Oh, well...

187
00:08:58,928 --> 00:09:00,196
Would you...

188
00:09:00,263 --> 00:09:04,066
Well, it has been tough
for us.

189
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:05,536
At home.

190
00:09:05,601 --> 00:09:07,803
You know, it's been so hard
watching you

191
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:11,674
beat your heads
against the wall for 25 years

192
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,744
and I'm not sure
how much longer

193
00:09:13,809 --> 00:09:16,212
we can keep going on
like this.

194
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:18,514
What?

195
00:09:22,052 --> 00:09:23,653
Well...

196
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,188
Bill, Ted,

197
00:09:26,255 --> 00:09:28,190
I'd love to spend
the last part

198
00:09:28,256 --> 00:09:31,227
of this session
with your wives.

199
00:09:31,894 --> 00:09:33,295
Alone?

200
00:09:33,363 --> 00:09:35,832
Yes, alone.

201
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:37,234
Right. Okay.

202
00:09:37,301 --> 00:09:40,570
We'll see you
at home, okay?

203
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,639
Okay. All right, then.

204
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:45,875
Oh, yeah.

205
00:09:45,942 --> 00:09:46,942
Yeah.

206
00:09:51,914 --> 00:09:54,583
Dude, did you know
they felt that way?

207
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,785
We have to fix this.

208
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,155
The thing is,
they're right, Bill.

209
00:10:00,222 --> 00:10:01,625
They're princesses.

210
00:10:01,692 --> 00:10:03,058
Yeah.

211
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,760
We pulled them out of their
lives to be here with us.

212
00:10:04,827 --> 00:10:07,663
And they didn't come
all this way for this.

213
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,267
That's why we gotta
keep working, dude.

214
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,101
But isn't that the problem?

215
00:10:12,168 --> 00:10:13,235
Yeah.

216
00:10:13,302 --> 00:10:15,203
But it's also the solution.

217
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,306
Yeah. I guess.

218
00:10:19,609 --> 00:10:21,110
Dude, this is transcendent.

219
00:10:21,177 --> 00:10:22,479
Is this Fillmore '66?

220
00:10:22,544 --> 00:10:23,947
No, Monterey Pop, '67.

221
00:10:24,013 --> 00:10:26,016
That second sound check
where they did that riff

222
00:10:26,081 --> 00:10:27,350
on <i>Amazing Grace.</i>

223
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:29,085
How's it goin', Dads?

224
00:10:29,152 --> 00:10:30,419
How's it goin', girls?

225
00:10:30,485 --> 00:10:31,787
How was therapy?

226
00:10:31,854 --> 00:10:33,456
It went okay. Yeah.

227
00:10:33,523 --> 00:10:35,759
Hey, Dad, by the way,
Gramps was wrong.

228
00:10:35,825 --> 00:10:38,194
The wedding song
was most luminous.

229
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,129
Oh, thank you, B.

230
00:10:40,196 --> 00:10:41,431
Glad you dug it, Billie.

231
00:10:41,496 --> 00:10:42,931
No, seriously,
Uncle Ted,

232
00:10:42,999 --> 00:10:44,668
when did you get so excellent
on theremin?

233
00:10:44,735 --> 00:10:47,137
Your playing rivaled,
and I'm not kidding,

234
00:10:47,202 --> 00:10:48,471
Clara Rockmore.

235
00:10:48,538 --> 00:10:50,005
Aw, thanks, T.

236
00:10:50,072 --> 00:10:52,775
Clara Rockmore
was definitely an inspiration.

237
00:10:52,842 --> 00:10:53,809
Yeah.

238
00:10:53,876 --> 00:10:55,144
- And, Uncle Bill!
- Yeah.

239
00:10:55,211 --> 00:10:56,511
The throat singing, I mean,

240
00:10:56,578 --> 00:10:59,014
it was a whole new level
of eloquence.

241
00:10:59,081 --> 00:11:01,216
Some serious <i>buga khoomei.</i>

242
00:11:01,283 --> 00:11:02,785
Whoa.

243
00:11:02,851 --> 00:11:05,721
Your musical acumen
is most impressive, girls.

244
00:11:08,691 --> 00:11:09,992
Hey, Dad,
good luck on the song.

245
00:11:10,058 --> 00:11:11,528
You got this.

246
00:11:23,539 --> 00:11:25,574
What is it, Ted?

247
00:11:26,442 --> 00:11:28,144
Liz is right.

248
00:11:28,211 --> 00:11:32,380
We have been banging our heads
against a wall for 25 years.

249
00:11:32,447 --> 00:11:34,917
And I'm tired, dude.

250
00:11:34,984 --> 00:11:36,418
Ted.

251
00:11:36,485 --> 00:11:38,855
We have a destiny to fulfill.

252
00:11:38,921 --> 00:11:40,123
Yeah.

253
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:43,025
And think
about our fans, dude.

254
00:11:43,926 --> 00:11:46,797
Bob and Wendy
will totally understand.

255
00:11:46,863 --> 00:11:50,734
Eileen we haven't heard from
for several years.

256
00:11:51,466 --> 00:11:53,870
Bill?

257
00:11:53,937 --> 00:11:55,471
What?

258
00:11:56,806 --> 00:12:00,744
I went into
Cyrus Adler Music yesterday.

259
00:12:00,811 --> 00:12:04,681
He said he'd give me $6,400
for the Les Paul.

260
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,785
Are you saying...

261
00:12:12,188 --> 00:12:13,889
Yeah.

262
00:12:15,091 --> 00:12:16,826
I think I am.

263
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,731
Yeah.

264
00:12:24,033 --> 00:12:25,668
Yeah.

265
00:12:29,538 --> 00:12:31,508
Whoa!

266
00:12:32,908 --> 00:12:34,577
Dude! Dude!

267
00:12:35,044 --> 00:12:36,578
It's the future!

268
00:12:36,645 --> 00:12:40,015
Greetings,
my excellent friends.

269
00:12:40,081 --> 00:12:41,951
Do we know you?

270
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:44,320
I'm Kelly.

271
00:12:44,386 --> 00:12:46,989
Wait, you're Rufus' daughter!

272
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:48,457
I am.

273
00:12:48,524 --> 00:12:50,359
And I've been wanting to
meet you my whole life.

274
00:12:50,426 --> 00:12:52,427
It must be very disappointing.

275
00:12:52,495 --> 00:12:54,297
Not at all.

276
00:12:54,364 --> 00:12:56,066
We have a problem, gentlemen.

277
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:59,002
Potentially,
a very serious problem.

278
00:12:59,068 --> 00:13:00,469
About the music?

279
00:13:00,535 --> 00:13:03,438
About the music.
They just wanna talk to you.

280
00:13:03,505 --> 00:13:05,507
Mmm-hmm.

281
00:13:05,575 --> 00:13:08,311
Dude, I got a very bad feeling
about this.

282
00:13:08,378 --> 00:13:09,846
It'll be fine, Ted.

283
00:13:09,912 --> 00:13:12,883
They totally love us
in the future, dude.

284
00:13:20,289 --> 00:13:21,656
Whoa!

285
00:13:21,724 --> 00:13:24,326
Dude, our dads
are totally in trouble.

286
00:13:24,393 --> 00:13:25,729
I feel so bad for 'em.

287
00:13:25,796 --> 00:13:27,097
They've been doing this
on their own

288
00:13:27,163 --> 00:13:28,398
for the longest time.

289
00:13:28,464 --> 00:13:29,665
Yeah, I wish
there was some way

290
00:13:29,731 --> 00:13:30,632
we could help 'em out,
you know?

291
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,970
Yeah. But how?

292
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,812
Whoa!

293
00:14:07,803 --> 00:14:09,572
- Dude.
- Yeah?

294
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:10,940
The future.

295
00:14:11,006 --> 00:14:12,475
Yeah.

296
00:14:25,587 --> 00:14:27,089
Rufus.

297
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:31,260
<i>Greetings,
my excellent friends.</i>

298
00:14:31,326 --> 00:14:33,330

299

303
00:14:51,081 --> 00:14:53,115
Bill and Ted.

304
00:14:55,485 --> 00:14:57,220
Step forward.

305
00:15:04,394 --> 00:15:06,028
How's it goin'...

306
00:15:06,096 --> 00:15:07,363
Great Ones?

307
00:15:07,429 --> 00:15:08,798
It's, uh...

308
00:15:08,864 --> 00:15:11,100
It's good to be back.

309
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:13,970
What have you got to say
for yourselves?

310
00:15:17,974 --> 00:15:19,442
Be...

311
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:21,576
excellent to each other.

312
00:15:21,644 --> 00:15:23,379
And party on, dudes.

313
00:15:23,446 --> 00:15:25,048
Yeah.

314
00:15:25,681 --> 00:15:27,850
Twenty-five years ago,

315
00:15:27,917 --> 00:15:30,586
Wyld Stallyns played a concert

316
00:15:30,653 --> 00:15:32,388
at the Grand Canyon.

317
00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:34,456
That's true.

318
00:15:34,524 --> 00:15:36,525
One month ago,

319
00:15:36,591 --> 00:15:38,126
you played the Elks Lodge

320
00:15:38,193 --> 00:15:40,329
in Barstow, California,
for 40 people,

321
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:43,899
most of whom were there only
because it was $2 taco night,

322
00:15:43,966 --> 00:15:45,600
whatever the hell that means.

323
00:15:45,668 --> 00:15:48,871
- Well, yeah. We did!
- Yeah. We did!

324
00:15:50,806 --> 00:15:55,045
You were supposed to
unite the world in song.

325
00:16:00,383 --> 00:16:02,084
According to her father,

326
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:05,587
a song
created by Preston/Logan...

327
00:16:05,654 --> 00:16:07,089
That's us, dude.

328
00:16:07,157 --> 00:16:11,259
...at a concert performed
by everyone in the band

329
00:16:11,326 --> 00:16:13,495
at 7:17 p.m.

330
00:16:13,562 --> 00:16:15,664
at MP 46,

331
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:17,866
that's tonight,

332
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:20,536
will save reality
as we know it,

333
00:16:20,602 --> 00:16:24,940
uniting humanity
across all time.

334
00:16:25,508 --> 00:16:26,743
Wait...

335
00:16:26,808 --> 00:16:28,677
I'm sorry.

336
00:16:28,745 --> 00:16:30,312
What?

337
00:16:30,379 --> 00:16:32,480
Did you say,

338
00:16:32,548 --> 00:16:35,750
"Reality as we know it"?

339
00:16:35,817 --> 00:16:37,886
Yes!

340
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,894
Oh.

341
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:52,168
Whoa.

342
00:16:53,369 --> 00:16:55,971
We need to hear the song

343
00:16:56,038 --> 00:17:00,109
in 77 minutes and 25 seconds.

344
00:17:00,176 --> 00:17:03,379
You have
everything you require.

345
00:17:03,446 --> 00:17:05,781
Get to work.

346
00:17:06,648 --> 00:17:09,417
Dude, they totally hate us.

347
00:17:09,484 --> 00:17:12,587
And I've never even
heard of MP 46.

348
00:17:12,654 --> 00:17:14,257
Yeah.

349
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,825
Kelly!

350
00:17:16,526 --> 00:17:19,062
How does a song save reality?

351
00:17:19,128 --> 00:17:21,996
That I can't tell you,
but it has to.

352
00:17:22,064 --> 00:17:23,932
Somehow.

353
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,301
The Great Turntable
is tipping.

354
00:17:26,368 --> 00:17:29,504
That there is the center
of space and time.

355
00:17:29,571 --> 00:17:33,308
San Dimas 700 years ago,
7:17 p.m.

356
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,610
My father believed
that the song

357
00:17:35,678 --> 00:17:37,580
could be the nexus point
that brings

358
00:17:37,646 --> 00:17:39,347
humanity into rhythm
and harmony.

359
00:17:39,414 --> 00:17:41,017
How?

360
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,986
We only discovered
this recently, but without it,

361
00:17:43,051 --> 00:17:44,753
reality will collapse,

362
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,790
and time and space
will cease to exist.

363
00:17:48,891 --> 00:17:51,728
So until 7:17 p.m...

364
00:17:51,794 --> 00:17:53,461
Anything is possible.

365
00:17:53,528 --> 00:17:55,364
And after 7:17 p.m.?

366
00:17:55,431 --> 00:18:00,269
Without the song,
there is no after 7:17 p.m.

367
00:18:06,442 --> 00:18:09,411
This was my dad's.
He'd want you to have it.

368
00:18:09,478 --> 00:18:13,048
It'll help keep track
of the time in San Dimas.

369
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,923
"Sometimes
things don't make sense..."

370
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:24,794
"...until the end
of the story."

371
00:18:24,859 --> 00:18:27,296
That's what my dad
always said.

372
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:30,233
I'll leave you to it?

373
00:18:41,711 --> 00:18:43,312
Okay.

374
00:18:43,378 --> 00:18:44,847
Now alls we gotta do

375
00:18:44,913 --> 00:18:46,915
is write the greatest song
ever written.

376
00:18:46,982 --> 00:18:50,685
That brings the entire world
into rhythm and harmony.

377
00:18:50,752 --> 00:18:53,855
And saves reality
as we know it.

378
00:18:53,923 --> 00:18:55,825
All through...

379
00:18:56,392 --> 00:18:58,027
time.

380
00:19:01,131 --> 00:19:01,964
Dude.

381
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,633
We've spent our whole life

382
00:19:03,699 --> 00:19:06,101
trying to write the song
that will unite the world.

383
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:09,170
What makes us think we can
write it in, like, 75 minutes?

384
00:19:09,238 --> 00:19:11,039
Ted, we had to have written
that song.

385
00:19:11,106 --> 00:19:13,442
The people in the future
told us we did.

386
00:19:13,509 --> 00:19:15,377
Yeah. I guess.

387
00:19:15,444 --> 00:19:18,513
Which means
we have it in us, dude.

388
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,915
Maybe we just haven't
written it yet.

389
00:19:20,982 --> 00:19:22,417
Maybe we're still gonna.

390
00:19:22,484 --> 00:19:24,152
Well, if we haven't
written it yet,

391
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,622
but we know
we're gonna at some point,

392
00:19:26,689 --> 00:19:28,824
why can't we just
go to the future

393
00:19:28,891 --> 00:19:30,993
when we have written it?

394
00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:33,229
And take it from ourselves!

395
00:19:33,296 --> 00:19:34,963
Yeah!

396
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:36,898
Ted! You have had many

397
00:19:36,965 --> 00:19:39,067
counterintuitive ideas
over the years,

398
00:19:39,134 --> 00:19:40,537
but this is by far

399
00:19:40,603 --> 00:19:43,273
the counterintuitivest
of them all, dude!

400
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,876
Except, won't that be stealing?

401
00:19:49,478 --> 00:19:51,346
How is that stealing

402
00:19:51,413 --> 00:19:54,817
if we're stealing it
from ourselves, dude?

403
00:19:55,584 --> 00:19:57,821
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

404
00:20:00,256 --> 00:20:02,192
I hope it still works.

405
00:20:02,258 --> 00:20:03,593
Yeah.

406
00:20:06,028 --> 00:20:08,463
How far into our future
do you think we gotta go?

407
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:11,099
It depends on when we think
we wrote that song.

408
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:14,269
Let's be conservative.
Say, two years?

409
00:20:14,336 --> 00:20:15,538
Sounds good, Ted.

410
00:20:15,605 --> 00:20:16,971
Then, once we get the song,

411
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:19,142
we'll go back home
to right before we left.

412
00:20:20,976 --> 00:20:22,378
And then what?

413
00:20:22,443 --> 00:20:26,048
Unite the world
and save reality, dude.

414
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,288
- Bill, my friend.
- Yes, Ted, my friend?

415
00:20:32,355 --> 00:20:34,556
I have a feeling
things are about to change

416
00:20:34,623 --> 00:20:35,958
in a most outstanding way.

417
00:20:36,025 --> 00:20:38,194
I could not agree more.

418
00:21:00,682 --> 00:21:01,718
You okay, dude?

419
00:21:01,784 --> 00:21:03,286
Yeah. You?

420
00:21:03,353 --> 00:21:04,720
Yeah.

421
00:21:04,787 --> 00:21:06,654
Let's go say hello to
ourselves and get that song.

422
00:21:06,721 --> 00:21:08,691
It's a rusty bucket, dude.

423
00:21:08,758 --> 00:21:11,527
<i>To those who rock</i>

424
00:21:11,594 --> 00:21:12,894
Over here, dude.

425
00:21:12,961 --> 00:21:14,063
<i>They say
we're talking the talk</i>

426
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,564
<i>But we're walking the walk</i>

427
00:21:15,631 --> 00:21:18,567
Wait. We're playing
<i>Those Who Rock?</i>

428
00:21:18,634 --> 00:21:19,734
Here?

429
00:21:19,801 --> 00:21:20,903
<i>...rock, yeah!</i>

430
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:24,007
<i>We are those who rock</i>

431
00:21:24,073 --> 00:21:25,107
Everybody!

432
00:21:25,173 --> 00:21:27,576
<i>We are those who rock</i>

433
00:21:27,643 --> 00:21:28,677
Clap your hands now!

434
00:21:28,743 --> 00:21:31,780
<i>We are those who rock</i>

435
00:21:31,846 --> 00:21:33,214
<i>Yeah, rock!</i>

436
00:21:33,281 --> 00:21:35,417
Oh, dude, that's us!

437
00:21:39,288 --> 00:21:40,890
Don't look
and they won't see us, dude!

438
00:21:40,957 --> 00:21:43,325
Bill, wait!

439
00:21:43,392 --> 00:21:46,128
Go, go, go!

440
00:21:46,194 --> 00:21:48,931
- Almost at the van!
- Hey, us's, stop!

441
00:21:52,534 --> 00:21:54,136
Oh, hello!

442
00:21:54,202 --> 00:21:55,903
We totally forgot
you were coming.

443
00:21:55,971 --> 00:21:57,707
- Yeah.
- How great to see you.

444
00:21:57,773 --> 00:22:01,809
What are you talking about?
You totally ran away from us.

445
00:22:01,876 --> 00:22:04,446
Look, guys, we know exactly
what you're thinking.

446
00:22:04,512 --> 00:22:07,015
Why would we be playing
Open Mic Night at 6:15 p.m.

447
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:10,886
when, in fact, we have become
such huge rock stars again.

448
00:22:10,952 --> 00:22:12,187
Yeah.

449
00:22:12,253 --> 00:22:13,321
Here's the answer.

450
00:22:13,388 --> 00:22:14,823
- Yeah.
- Us being here

451
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,859
is humorously ironic.

452
00:22:16,925 --> 00:22:18,694
Do you believe us?

453
00:22:19,595 --> 00:22:20,596
No.

454
00:22:20,663 --> 00:22:21,931
Not at all.

455
00:22:21,998 --> 00:22:24,334
Well, I feel sorry
for you, then.

456
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,535
Dude,
I think we came too early.

457
00:22:26,602 --> 00:22:29,839
These other us's
don't have the song.

458
00:22:29,905 --> 00:22:31,240
Why don't you go
write it yourselves

459
00:22:31,307 --> 00:22:34,543
instead of trying
to steal it from us?

460
00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:37,645
You're the one
who couldn't write it, Ted.

461
00:22:39,381 --> 00:22:44,019
Well, you're the one
who lost his wife, Ted.

462
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,788
What?

463
00:22:45,855 --> 00:22:47,221
What are you talking about?

464
00:22:47,288 --> 00:22:50,326
Here's what happened, Bill.

465
00:22:50,392 --> 00:22:52,260
After you failed
couples therapy,

466
00:22:52,327 --> 00:22:55,230
Liz and Jo were visited by
other thems from the future

467
00:22:55,298 --> 00:22:56,632
who gave them a phone booth

468
00:22:56,699 --> 00:22:58,768
and sent them all
through time and space

469
00:22:58,834 --> 00:23:00,335
looking for just one life

470
00:23:00,402 --> 00:23:02,004
where they could be happy
with you!

471
00:23:02,069 --> 00:23:03,405
And guess what?

472
00:23:03,472 --> 00:23:05,440
They didn't find one!

473
00:23:05,507 --> 00:23:07,476
And now we've been alone
for two years

474
00:23:07,542 --> 00:23:10,478
'cause you sent
our wives away.

475
00:23:10,546 --> 00:23:11,947
No way.

476
00:23:12,013 --> 00:23:13,514
Yes way!

477
00:23:13,582 --> 00:23:15,551
Our wives have been gone
for two years

478
00:23:15,617 --> 00:23:17,785
and you didn't do anything
about it?

479
00:23:17,853 --> 00:23:19,255
Oh, you did, all right.

480
00:23:19,321 --> 00:23:21,489
You went back
and you made it worse!

481
00:23:21,557 --> 00:23:23,224
And guess what else?

482
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:25,493
Your daughters
won't even talk to you.

483
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,528
What?

484
00:23:26,596 --> 00:23:28,630
You're a dick, Ted.

485
00:23:28,696 --> 00:23:31,399
- You want a piece of me, Ted?
- Ted, he's not worth it!

486
00:23:31,467 --> 00:23:34,003
Hey! He's not worth it, dude.
We gotta go.

487
00:23:34,068 --> 00:23:37,605
Yeah!
And save our marriages.

488
00:23:37,673 --> 00:23:39,342
Losers! Has-beens!

489
00:23:39,407 --> 00:23:41,142
- Whatever!
- Stop fighting with yourself!

490
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,644
Flashes in the pans!

491
00:23:42,711 --> 00:23:44,180
Stop fighting with yourself!

492
00:23:47,883 --> 00:23:49,451
That did not go well.

493
00:23:49,518 --> 00:23:52,788
Yeah. And your you is
a very contentious dickweed.

494
00:23:52,855 --> 00:23:55,658
Bill, we gotta go back
and talk with Liz and Jo.

495
00:23:55,724 --> 00:23:57,292
On it, dude.

496
00:24:04,365 --> 00:24:08,135
Please, Mother,
Dad said Preston/Logan

497
00:24:08,202 --> 00:24:10,306
and everyone in the band
will unite...

498
00:24:10,373 --> 00:24:13,042
I remember what he said.
Every word.

499
00:24:13,108 --> 00:24:14,710
Well, then,
give them a chance.

500
00:24:14,777 --> 00:24:16,112
I gave them a chance

501
00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:17,846
and everything they could
possibly need,

502
00:24:17,913 --> 00:24:19,682
but they bolted.

503
00:24:20,782 --> 00:24:22,317
Kelly,

504
00:24:22,384 --> 00:24:24,185
you know your father and I
agreed on everything,

505
00:24:24,252 --> 00:24:26,187
but there are
other interpretations

506
00:24:26,255 --> 00:24:28,157
of the information
he was acting on.

507
00:24:28,223 --> 00:24:29,758
I'm aware of that.

508
00:24:29,825 --> 00:24:32,394
Many on the council believe
that it is, in fact,

509
00:24:32,461 --> 00:24:34,229
the death of Bill and Ted

510
00:24:34,296 --> 00:24:36,765
that will bring the new epoch.

511
00:24:36,832 --> 00:24:39,935
Well, I disagree
with that completely!

512
00:24:40,001 --> 00:24:41,569
That's atrocious!

513
00:24:41,636 --> 00:24:44,438
Well, maybe someday
when you're the Great Leader,

514
00:24:44,506 --> 00:24:45,975
you can make the decisions

515
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:48,209
that will affect
all time and space.

516
00:24:48,277 --> 00:24:50,979
You could just say "Leader."

517
00:24:51,046 --> 00:24:52,581
- So pretentious.
- Is it ready?

518
00:24:52,647 --> 00:24:55,750
Yes,
Great Leader. It should be.

519
00:24:55,817 --> 00:24:56,785
"Should be"?

520
00:24:56,852 --> 00:24:58,053
Is.

521
00:24:58,119 --> 00:24:59,954
Madam.

522
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,258
Do you know who I am?

523
00:25:03,192 --> 00:25:06,295
Yes, Great Leader.

524
00:25:11,866 --> 00:25:13,801
You know what to do.

525
00:25:13,868 --> 00:25:17,173
You must not fail.

526
00:25:17,573 --> 00:25:18,740
Must...

527
00:25:18,807 --> 00:25:20,041
not...

528
00:25:20,108 --> 00:25:21,711
fail.

529
00:25:28,651 --> 00:25:31,452
I cannot believe you're gonna
kill Bill and Ted!

530
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:33,221
Dad would be so mad at you.

531
00:25:33,288 --> 00:25:36,057
We're out of options, Kel.

532
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:38,693
The unravelling
has already begun.

533
00:25:55,277 --> 00:25:56,845
Future dude! You're back?

534
00:25:56,912 --> 00:25:59,848
I'm looking for your fathers.
Have they been here?

535
00:26:00,816 --> 00:26:02,285
No.

536
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:10,391
Where are our dads?

537
00:26:10,459 --> 00:26:11,826
They're in a tribulation,
aren't they?

538
00:26:11,894 --> 00:26:13,362
They are.

539
00:26:13,429 --> 00:26:14,430
Listen, you didn't see
a scary-looking robot

540
00:26:14,496 --> 00:26:15,730
from the future, did you?

541
00:26:15,798 --> 00:26:17,098
Oh, what? No.

542
00:26:17,165 --> 00:26:19,300
My mom, who overreacts
about everything

543
00:26:19,366 --> 00:26:21,470
- just sent one.
- To get our dads?

544
00:26:21,537 --> 00:26:23,538
Don't worry.
I won't let that happen.

545
00:26:23,605 --> 00:26:26,409
Well, we're trying
to help 'em, too.

546
00:26:27,108 --> 00:26:28,343
Hey.

547
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:31,214
Hey, this can go, like...

548
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,384
like, anywhere, right?
Like, all throughout time?

549
00:26:35,451 --> 00:26:37,353
That's correct,
but I need to stay.

550
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,354
My guess is that
my mom's emissary

551
00:26:39,421 --> 00:26:40,756
will be looking for them here.

552
00:26:40,823 --> 00:26:42,425
Well,

553
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:43,759
Thea and I were gonna help
our dads with their music

554
00:26:43,826 --> 00:26:45,293
by putting together
samples for 'em.

555
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:46,727
Yeah, but now it appears

556
00:26:46,795 --> 00:26:48,563
we could put together
an actual band.

557
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,865
I mean, it's just
them, and they're all alone!

558
00:26:49,932 --> 00:26:51,599
Hey, so, do you mind

559
00:26:51,666 --> 00:26:53,201
while you stay here and wait
for the scary-looking robot,

560
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:54,569
you could show us
how to use the booth?

561
00:26:58,307 --> 00:26:59,941
Dude, we gotta remember.

562
00:27:00,008 --> 00:27:01,375
Make it better, not worse!

563
00:27:01,442 --> 00:27:03,711
Yeah.
I hope they're still there.

564
00:27:03,778 --> 00:27:06,748
It's just that the job that
they've been given, it is...

565
00:27:06,815 --> 00:27:08,549
- Impossible.
- ...impossible.

566
00:27:08,616 --> 00:27:10,284
Joanna!

567
00:27:10,352 --> 00:27:11,453
- Elizabeth!
- Hi!

568
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:12,854
We need to talk to you.

569
00:27:12,921 --> 00:27:14,288
Oh, and we're back.

570
00:27:14,355 --> 00:27:15,891
This is super important,
Dr. Wood.

571
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:18,393
We just saw ourselves
two years in the future.

572
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,760
Wait, you're
time-travelling again?

573
00:27:19,827 --> 00:27:21,730
Only to save reality
as we know it.

574
00:27:21,797 --> 00:27:23,132
Okay. Maybe...

575
00:27:23,199 --> 00:27:24,699
But we just found out
something way worse.

576
00:27:24,766 --> 00:27:26,268
- You're leaving us.
- What?

577
00:27:26,335 --> 00:27:28,769
- What? No, we're not.
- No, are we?

578
00:27:28,836 --> 00:27:30,105
Yes. You are.

579
00:27:30,172 --> 00:27:32,641
Yeah. And you have real
good reason to, Jo.

580
00:27:32,708 --> 00:27:34,375
'Cause
we seriously appear

581
00:27:34,442 --> 00:27:35,845
to be living in our van.

582
00:27:35,911 --> 00:27:38,346
Oh, dude, we are totally
living in that van.

583
00:27:38,413 --> 00:27:40,015
And I'm drinking way too much.

584
00:27:40,082 --> 00:27:41,250
Darling, you don't even drink.

585
00:27:41,317 --> 00:27:42,550
Not yet.

586
00:27:42,617 --> 00:27:43,952
But I'm going to. A lot.

587
00:27:44,019 --> 00:27:45,788
- What?
- Yeah. And the lying.

588
00:27:45,855 --> 00:27:47,923
You cannot believe
what liars we are.

589
00:27:47,989 --> 00:27:50,925
Yeah, desperate, pathetic,
lying losers.

590
00:27:50,992 --> 00:27:52,560
Oh, no!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

591
00:27:52,627 --> 00:27:54,362
Okay, let's stop for a moment

592
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,498
and take notice
of the dynamic.

593
00:27:56,565 --> 00:27:59,301
Uh, threatened by the thought
of losing your...

594
00:27:59,367 --> 00:28:00,402
Princesses.

595
00:28:00,469 --> 00:28:01,737
Sure. That's a word.

596
00:28:01,804 --> 00:28:03,438
No, we actually
are princesses.

597
00:28:03,505 --> 00:28:05,707
We were born in 1410.
1408.

598
00:28:05,773 --> 00:28:08,943
Okay.
What about us leaving you?

599
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:10,112
Oh, man.

600
00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:12,214
That's totally why we're here.

601
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,515
Yeah. To prove that we're not

602
00:28:13,582 --> 00:28:14,984
the losers
we just saw we were.

603
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:17,353
Even though those loser us's
tried to tell us

604
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,921
not to come and talk to you.

605
00:28:18,987 --> 00:28:21,123
Yeah. Like we were somehow
gonna make it worse.

606
00:28:22,724 --> 00:28:25,727
But we're not
making it worse, right?

607
00:28:26,394 --> 00:28:27,662
Elizabeth?

608
00:28:27,729 --> 00:28:29,230
- Joanna?
- Hmm?

609
00:28:29,298 --> 00:28:30,865
Dr. Wood?

610
00:28:30,932 --> 00:28:32,267
Huh?

611
00:28:32,334 --> 00:28:33,769
Dude,
we totally made it worse.

612
00:28:33,836 --> 00:28:36,505
- We'll be back.
- And make it better.

613
00:28:36,571 --> 00:28:39,740
When you say 1408,
you mean the year...

614
00:28:39,807 --> 00:28:41,676
- Oh, one last thing.
- Yeah.

615
00:28:41,742 --> 00:28:44,012
Older yous from the future
are just about to show up

616
00:28:44,078 --> 00:28:45,246
to take you on a trip

617
00:28:45,314 --> 00:28:46,782
in search of a happy life
with us.

618
00:28:46,848 --> 00:28:49,416
Don't go. 'Cause you're not
gonna find one.

619
00:28:49,483 --> 00:28:50,518
Yeah, but you're gonna go.

620
00:28:50,585 --> 00:28:51,819
- So, don't go.
- So, go?

621
00:28:51,886 --> 00:28:54,121
No. I guess, go.

622
00:28:54,189 --> 00:28:55,624
We love you guys.

623
00:28:55,691 --> 00:28:57,526
We're gonna fix it.

624
00:29:02,329 --> 00:29:03,698
That went terrible, dude.

625
00:29:03,766 --> 00:29:05,500
Two years forward
was clearly not enough.

626
00:29:05,567 --> 00:29:07,201
Let's try five this time.

627
00:29:07,268 --> 00:29:09,136
Dude, I miss Liz already.

628
00:29:09,203 --> 00:29:10,672
Hang in there, Ted.

629
00:29:10,739 --> 00:29:12,473
Things are about to get
a whole lot better.

630
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:14,076
What time is it, dude?

631
00:29:14,142 --> 00:29:16,412
Fifty-eight minutes.

632
00:29:16,478 --> 00:29:17,746
Okay, let's go.

633
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:33,862
Actually, we have to go, too.

634
00:29:33,929 --> 00:29:37,399
Right. Those older us's
they referred to are outside.

635
00:29:37,465 --> 00:29:38,800
I'm a little bit nervous

636
00:29:38,867 --> 00:29:40,201
to time-travel again,
to be honest.

637
00:29:40,268 --> 00:29:41,236
As am I.
We haven't time-traveled

638
00:29:41,301 --> 00:29:42,770
in more than two decades.

639
00:29:42,837 --> 00:29:44,373
- No, I know.
- You know what, ladies?

640
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,472
I'd like to recommend
we see each other

641
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:47,442
a minimum of two to three,

642
00:29:47,509 --> 00:29:49,010
five days a week.

643
00:29:49,076 --> 00:29:51,180
- All right, then.
- Lovely, lovely. Thank you.

644
00:30:00,255 --> 00:30:02,157
No. No.

645
00:30:02,223 --> 00:30:03,725
No!

646
00:30:18,506 --> 00:30:19,574
It worked.

647
00:30:19,641 --> 00:30:21,744
Most indubitably.

648
00:30:23,578 --> 00:30:25,113
You sure this is it?

649
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:58,012
Uh, excuse me,
Mr. Jimi Hendrix?

650
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:01,449
Can I just say it is an honor
to be in your presence, dude?

651
00:31:01,516 --> 00:31:05,519
I mean, <i>Electric Ladyland,</i>
what can we even say?

652
00:31:05,586 --> 00:31:06,821
Who are you two?

653
00:31:06,888 --> 00:31:08,355
Oh. Um...

654
00:31:08,423 --> 00:31:10,959
Willamina "Billie" S. Logan,
and Thea "Theodora" Preston.

655
00:31:11,026 --> 00:31:14,363
Yeah. We're here for our dads
to help them unite the world.

656
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:16,999
Like, no exaggeration,
literally unite the world.

657
00:31:17,066 --> 00:31:18,933
By putting together
a killer band for 'em,

658
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,702
and we had to start
with you, dude.

659
00:31:20,769 --> 00:31:22,436
So, question...

660
00:31:22,503 --> 00:31:26,273
how would you like to be a key
part of this epochal song?

661
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,177
No.

662
00:31:35,183 --> 00:31:37,251
Dude, we have to have
Jimi Hendrix.

663
00:31:37,318 --> 00:31:38,787
Yeah.

664
00:31:38,854 --> 00:31:40,855
But how are we gonna get him
to be in a band

665
00:31:40,923 --> 00:31:42,457
with people he hasn't
even heard of?

666
00:31:42,523 --> 00:31:44,392
Well, okay.

667
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,296
Who's somebody
he has heard of?

668
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,793
<i>Oh, when the saints</i>

669
00:32:17,859 --> 00:32:19,627
<i>Go marching in</i>

670
00:32:19,694 --> 00:32:23,698
<i>Oh, when the saints
go marching in</i>

671
00:32:23,765 --> 00:32:27,636
<i>Well, I want to be
in that number</i>

672
00:32:27,702 --> 00:32:30,904
<i>Oh, when the saints
go marching in</i>

673
00:32:30,971 --> 00:32:33,841
All right, all right,
all right. All right.

674
00:32:33,907 --> 00:32:37,744
Can I help you, young ladies?

675
00:32:37,811 --> 00:32:39,480
Uh, we're so sorry.

676
00:32:39,548 --> 00:32:43,852
Please excuse us,
Mr. Armstrong, sir.

677
00:32:44,353 --> 00:32:45,820
Uh...

678
00:32:45,886 --> 00:32:49,389
Might we have a word with you?

679
00:32:51,826 --> 00:32:54,395
So, that is <i>Amazing Grace</i>

680
00:32:54,462 --> 00:32:56,798
played by a Mr. Jimi Hendrix.

681
00:32:56,865 --> 00:32:58,767
Who's in the band.

682
00:32:58,833 --> 00:33:00,502
And specifically requested
your presence, so...

683
00:33:00,567 --> 00:33:02,203
And here's why.

684
00:33:02,269 --> 00:33:03,837
Your improvisations,
obviously influenced

685
00:33:03,904 --> 00:33:05,240
by Bunk Johnson
and King Oliver...

686
00:33:05,307 --> 00:33:07,075
Yeah, but ultimately
<i>sui generis.</i>

687
00:33:07,142 --> 00:33:09,144
...totally inspired him, sir.

688
00:33:09,211 --> 00:33:10,812
You gotta come
see this, fellas.

689
00:33:10,878 --> 00:33:12,179
What you got there, Lou?

690
00:33:12,247 --> 00:33:13,715
You liberated
all music, dude.

691
00:33:13,781 --> 00:33:16,049
Hey, what's that doohickey?

692
00:33:24,326 --> 00:33:25,827
Damn it!

693
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,598
We did it!

694
00:33:30,665 --> 00:33:32,768
Dude, look at where we live!

695
00:33:32,834 --> 00:33:34,570
One song did all this?

696
00:33:34,636 --> 00:33:36,270
Ted, what if it wasn't
just one song?

697
00:33:36,336 --> 00:33:38,972
What if after we wrote it
and saved the universe,

698
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:42,076
a dam broke and the songs
just kept comin' and comin'?

699
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,010
Oh, yeah.

700
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:52,452
Hello!

701
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:55,257
Younger us's, hello!

702
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:56,591
- Hello!
- Hello!

703
00:33:56,657 --> 00:33:58,959
This time,
we were expecting you.

704
00:33:59,027 --> 00:34:01,962
Yes, and unlike those
sad Open Mic blokes

705
00:34:02,029 --> 00:34:03,365
from three years ago...

706
00:34:03,432 --> 00:34:04,999
We are now finally able

707
00:34:05,066 --> 00:34:07,536
to muster some compassion
for them.

708
00:34:07,602 --> 00:34:09,836
...we actually do have...

709
00:34:09,903 --> 00:34:11,739
...the goods.

710
00:34:13,608 --> 00:34:16,545
To your futures.

711
00:34:16,612 --> 00:34:19,181
- We did it, dude.
- Yeah!

712
00:34:19,248 --> 00:34:21,150
Cheers!

713
00:34:25,085 --> 00:34:28,822
So, uh, why do you both have
English accents?

714
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:32,460
Ah. Funny story. Please.

715
00:34:34,728 --> 00:34:37,164
Once Bill and I were knighted,

716
00:34:37,231 --> 00:34:40,168
things got so good
with Liz and Jo

717
00:34:40,235 --> 00:34:42,170
that we decided, as families,

718
00:34:42,237 --> 00:34:46,407
to start summering
in medieval England.

719
00:34:46,474 --> 00:34:50,144
And I suppose it just
bloody well rubbed off!

720
00:34:51,478 --> 00:34:54,648
And I can't say how chuffed
we are about it.

721
00:34:54,715 --> 00:34:58,186
That is such a relief!

722
00:35:01,322 --> 00:35:02,757
I must say,

723
00:35:02,824 --> 00:35:05,393
as much as I disliked
those previous us's,

724
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,760
I like these us's.

725
00:35:06,827 --> 00:35:08,028
Yeah. I didn't have
a big problem

726
00:35:08,096 --> 00:35:09,463
with that other me,

727
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:12,166
but I do like this other me
even more.

728
00:35:12,233 --> 00:35:13,501
Yeah.

729
00:35:14,936 --> 00:35:16,638
Enough talking, mates.

730
00:35:16,704 --> 00:35:18,005
Are you ready...

731
00:35:18,072 --> 00:35:20,041
...for everything...

732
00:35:22,643 --> 00:35:24,445
...to change?

733
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:32,421
Whoa.

734
00:35:46,235 --> 00:35:48,469
That is truly...

735
00:35:48,536 --> 00:35:51,940
the most amazing song...

736
00:35:52,007 --> 00:35:54,809
I have ever heard.

737
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:57,179
It's great.

738
00:35:57,246 --> 00:35:59,814
Honestly, I wouldn't have
thought we had it in us.

739
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,083
Ah.

740
00:36:02,483 --> 00:36:04,018
But you do!

741
00:36:04,085 --> 00:36:06,221
And now it's time...

742
00:36:07,822 --> 00:36:10,424
to get it out to the world.

743
00:36:11,827 --> 00:36:13,162
Yeah!

744
00:36:17,798 --> 00:36:19,967
I'll never forget you,
Sir Bill.

745
00:36:20,034 --> 00:36:23,404
Right back at you,
Billie boyo.

746
00:36:25,739 --> 00:36:27,875
So long, I guess.

747
00:36:27,943 --> 00:36:29,311
And thanks!

748
00:36:29,378 --> 00:36:30,510
Yeah.

749
00:36:30,577 --> 00:36:31,978
So long.

750
00:36:32,045 --> 00:36:34,115
Tallyho!

751
00:36:37,251 --> 00:36:38,786
Marvelous!

752
00:36:38,853 --> 00:36:41,021
Ted, why were you acting
so weird with yourself, dude?

753
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:43,324
I don't know. I always seem
to act weird with myself.

754
00:36:43,391 --> 00:36:45,961
Yeah, you do!
You gotta get over that, dude.

755
00:36:46,027 --> 00:36:48,096
We got the song!

756
00:36:49,931 --> 00:36:51,733
Dave Grohl!

757
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,635
Who are you guys?

758
00:36:54,702 --> 00:36:56,271
What're you doin' in my house?

759
00:36:56,338 --> 00:36:57,772
Oh, no.

760
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:00,041
No, no, no.

761
00:37:10,284 --> 00:37:12,052
Now we'll wait
for those other us's

762
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:14,088
to go back
and change everything.

763
00:37:14,155 --> 00:37:17,225
To our lives
getting a whole lot better.

764
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:18,626
Yeah.

765
00:37:20,362 --> 00:37:24,365
Ted, seriously, slow down
on the vodka, dude.

766
00:37:26,335 --> 00:37:28,068
You guys totally lied to us!

767
00:37:28,135 --> 00:37:30,838
Why haven't you taken the song
back to San Dimas?

768
00:37:30,905 --> 00:37:33,242
Maybe 'cause it's not
our song!

769
00:37:33,307 --> 00:37:34,809
Poppycock!

770
00:37:34,876 --> 00:37:36,278
It's Dave Grohl's!

771
00:37:36,344 --> 00:37:39,481
And he's outside right now
calling the cops.

772
00:37:40,949 --> 00:37:42,184
Ted, I told you

773
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:43,652
Dave Grohl came back
this week.

774
00:37:43,717 --> 00:37:45,319
Totally thought
he came back next week.

775
00:37:45,387 --> 00:37:47,488
What were you guys
even thinking?

776
00:37:47,554 --> 00:37:49,856
Just 'cause you two couldn't
come up with a great song...

777
00:37:49,923 --> 00:37:51,391
And Dave Grohl did!

778
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:53,527
...doesn't mean we should
be punished for that.

779
00:37:54,628 --> 00:37:56,264
We're not gonna do it.

780
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,067
You have to!

781
00:37:59,134 --> 00:38:01,101
It's your only chance
to get our wives back.

782
00:38:01,168 --> 00:38:02,936
You were lying about that?

783
00:38:03,003 --> 00:38:04,905
Of course we were lying.

784
00:38:04,972 --> 00:38:06,541
Oh, man.

785
00:38:06,606 --> 00:38:08,375
Yeah, they don't want anything
to do with you!

786
00:38:08,443 --> 00:38:10,045
'Cause they traveled
all through time

787
00:38:10,112 --> 00:38:12,046
and finally realized
you are losers.

788
00:38:12,112 --> 00:38:15,016
Yeah, 'cause you make
bad choices!

789
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:16,550
Like this!

790
00:38:17,552 --> 00:38:19,354
Now, take the song!

791
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,888
Guys, seriously,

792
00:38:20,956 --> 00:38:23,024
you don't have to
pull guns on us.

793
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:25,793
Yeah? Watch what happens
when we don't.

794
00:38:27,661 --> 00:38:29,129
See?

795
00:38:29,197 --> 00:38:31,965
I have to admit, Bill.
You were right.

796
00:38:32,032 --> 00:38:33,201
Ted!

797
00:38:33,268 --> 00:38:35,336
- You have to do it.
- Yeah!

798
00:38:35,402 --> 00:38:36,870
- Our life is hell!
- Yeah!

799
00:38:36,938 --> 00:38:37,905
And if you don't go back
and change it...

800
00:38:37,972 --> 00:38:39,273
Change it!

801
00:38:51,452 --> 00:38:55,290
This ends now.
The lies, the delusions.

802
00:38:55,356 --> 00:38:57,459
I'm done with him.
I'm done with both of them.

803
00:38:57,525 --> 00:38:59,059
You're not
gonna kill Ted, Dad.

804
00:38:59,126 --> 00:39:01,596
He broke into
Dave Grohl's house!

805
00:39:01,661 --> 00:39:02,963
Dad, slow down.

806
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:04,599
We don't have
the whole story yet.

807
00:39:06,835 --> 00:39:09,838
Can't get away from us,
Bill and Ted.

808
00:39:09,905 --> 00:39:11,306
Ted, they're right.
They're us.

809
00:39:11,371 --> 00:39:13,373
They remember
everything we're gonna do!

810
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,042
That means
we gotta do something

811
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:17,445
we can't possibly remember.

812
00:39:18,413 --> 00:39:19,981
Shoot 'em.

813
00:39:22,351 --> 00:39:25,253
Oh, no.
They're gonna do the thing.

814
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,688
I was hoping

815
00:39:26,755 --> 00:39:28,890
they wouldn't remember
that this time.

816
00:39:30,992 --> 00:39:33,362
No one leaves the building.

817
00:39:47,074 --> 00:39:48,275
Dude, what do we do?

818
00:39:48,342 --> 00:39:50,310
No idea,
that's the point!

819
00:39:50,378 --> 00:39:51,612
I'm confused!

820
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:53,181
Me, too!

821
00:39:59,219 --> 00:40:00,855
Ted, that totally worked!

822
00:40:00,922 --> 00:40:03,625
Yeah. Maybe we should always
not know what we're doing.

823
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,226
Time?

824
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,428
Forty-seven minutes.

825
00:40:07,494 --> 00:40:09,262
All right, we gotta keep going
further into the future.

826
00:40:09,329 --> 00:40:11,465
At some point,
we must've written that song.

827
00:40:11,532 --> 00:40:13,668
- Try in five years.
- Okay.

828
00:40:18,005 --> 00:40:19,673
Dude.

829
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,907
What's that?

830
00:40:20,974 --> 00:40:22,677
I don't know.

831
00:40:22,744 --> 00:40:25,847
But it's most alarming.

832
00:40:25,913 --> 00:40:27,382
- Bill?
- I'm tryin', dude.

833
00:40:27,449 --> 00:40:29,617
- Bill?
- Almost there, dude.

834
00:40:29,684 --> 00:40:31,319
Bill!

835
00:40:31,686 --> 00:40:33,153
I got it!

836
00:40:54,342 --> 00:40:57,378
Come on! You again? I said no.

837
00:40:57,445 --> 00:40:59,713
To us. But I bet
you can't say no to this man.

838
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:02,483
Mr. Jimi Hendrix,
meet Mr. Louis Armstrong.

839
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:06,688
That lick you played
was the cat's meow, man.

840
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,456
It's blues, but also...

841
00:41:08,523 --> 00:41:10,725
What's the word you used,
young ladies?

842
00:41:10,791 --> 00:41:13,527
- Psychedelic.
- Psychedelic.

843
00:41:13,594 --> 00:41:15,429
Exactly.

844
00:41:15,496 --> 00:41:17,498
Very funny, whoever you are.

845
00:41:17,565 --> 00:41:20,934
Louis Armstrong's,
like, 65 years old.

846
00:41:21,001 --> 00:41:22,269
Dude, dude, I told you

847
00:41:22,336 --> 00:41:23,704
we should've gotten
older Louis.

848
00:41:23,771 --> 00:41:25,840
It was your idea, too!

849
00:41:25,907 --> 00:41:30,812
Well, the young ladies
picked me up in 1922, Jim.

850
00:41:30,878 --> 00:41:33,181
Which supports both that
we're putting together

851
00:41:33,248 --> 00:41:35,016
a most extraordinary band...

852
00:41:35,083 --> 00:41:36,751
Yeah. And that we are doing so

853
00:41:36,818 --> 00:41:38,787
by traveling
all throughout time.

854
00:41:38,853 --> 00:41:41,188
Come on, give me a break.

855
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,503
He dug that jive, hey?

856
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:57,238
<i>Potato Head Blues?</i>

857
00:41:57,304 --> 00:41:58,639
What kind of title is that?

858
00:41:58,706 --> 00:42:01,208
A definitive one,
Mr. Armstrong.

859
00:42:01,275 --> 00:42:02,842
So, what you're all saying

860
00:42:02,909 --> 00:42:07,047
is that you love a song
that I wrote in my future?

861
00:42:07,114 --> 00:42:08,349
Which is in your past.

862
00:42:08,416 --> 00:42:11,286
But we're all here
in this present.

863
00:42:11,353 --> 00:42:15,188
Which is actually the past?

864
00:42:15,255 --> 00:42:16,857
Exactly, gentlemen.

865
00:42:18,193 --> 00:42:19,895
Fascinating.

866
00:42:29,369 --> 00:42:32,873
<i>Herr</i> Mozart.
Now we're talkin'.

867
00:44:02,563 --> 00:44:05,467
Yeah!
Hey, Wolfie.

868
00:44:06,735 --> 00:44:08,269
Jimi.

869
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:16,743
Dude, the future totally
sent a killer robot after us.

870
00:44:16,811 --> 00:44:19,748
That's why we gotta find
the song, dude.

871
00:44:26,387 --> 00:44:27,889
Hopeless,

872
00:44:27,954 --> 00:44:29,389
helpless dying breath.

873
00:44:29,456 --> 00:44:32,559
Hopeless,
helpless dying breath.

874
00:44:32,626 --> 00:44:35,395
This can't possibly be
the song, dude.

875
00:44:35,463 --> 00:44:36,865
- Pain!
- Pain!

876
00:44:36,931 --> 00:44:38,398
- Death!
- Death!

877
00:44:38,465 --> 00:44:41,168
Welcome to...

878
00:44:41,235 --> 00:44:42,902
...the end!

879
00:44:45,505 --> 00:44:47,107
No way!

880
00:44:47,175 --> 00:44:49,878
- Enough! Stop!
- Enough! Stop!

881
00:44:51,978 --> 00:44:53,313
Come forward.

882
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:56,182
How's it goin', Bill and Ted?

883
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:57,483
How'd you like our song?

884
00:44:57,550 --> 00:45:00,253
- Is that a song?
- Yes!

885
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,989
It's a little
on the dark side,

886
00:45:02,056 --> 00:45:04,692
but, you know, that's cool.

887
00:45:04,759 --> 00:45:06,126
Why are you guys in prison?

888
00:45:06,193 --> 00:45:08,396
Oh, maybe because
you guys left us

889
00:45:08,461 --> 00:45:10,563
to take the fall
five years ago.

890
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:12,732
Ah. That's funny,
'cause for us

891
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,535
it's only, like,
five minutes ago.

892
00:45:14,601 --> 00:45:17,038
- Huh?
- So, we'll be leaving now.

893
00:45:17,105 --> 00:45:19,373
You're not goin' anywhere,
pretty boy.

894
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,641
We've been waiting for years

895
00:45:20,708 --> 00:45:22,210
to make things right.

896
00:45:22,277 --> 00:45:23,878
But everything's
gonna be different.

897
00:45:23,945 --> 00:45:28,115
'Cause unlike those last us's,
we actually have a song.

898
00:45:28,181 --> 00:45:29,183
Is it a song?

899
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:30,851
Yes!

900
00:45:30,918 --> 00:45:34,521
Bill, Ted, seriously,
we can't take that song back.

901
00:45:34,588 --> 00:45:37,391
Oh, you're not taking it back,
Curly.

902
00:45:37,458 --> 00:45:38,826
We're taking it back!

903
00:45:38,891 --> 00:45:40,627
You're gonna stay here
and rot

904
00:45:40,695 --> 00:45:43,264
and we're gonna go get lives
and our wives back!

905
00:45:43,331 --> 00:45:44,398
And unite the world!

906
00:45:44,465 --> 00:45:45,666
And save reality!

907
00:45:45,733 --> 00:45:47,836
- You are?
- Yes!

908
00:45:52,606 --> 00:45:54,609
Freeze, Preston/Logan.

909
00:45:54,675 --> 00:45:56,644
You know what happens
if he kills them, dude.

910
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:58,879
He kills us, dude.

911
00:46:01,014 --> 00:46:02,315
Hold on!

912
00:46:02,382 --> 00:46:04,451
You want some
Bill and Ted, punk?

913
00:46:06,253 --> 00:46:07,388
Get him!

914
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:14,061
That was not a song.

915
00:46:14,128 --> 00:46:15,363
Hmm?

916
00:46:15,429 --> 00:46:18,398
You're being a rotten idiot!

917
00:46:18,465 --> 00:46:19,800
That was horrible, dude.

918
00:46:19,867 --> 00:46:21,369
Those are the worst
us's yet, dude!

919
00:46:21,436 --> 00:46:22,437
Yeah. They did
save us, though.

920
00:46:22,503 --> 00:46:23,503
Yeah.

921
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:25,139
Oh, no!

922
00:46:25,206 --> 00:46:26,807
- Jo!
- Liz!

923
00:46:26,875 --> 00:46:28,442
- Oh, hi!
- How's it goin'?

924
00:46:28,509 --> 00:46:31,679
- Good.
- Oh, my God, is that you?

925
00:46:32,646 --> 00:46:34,280
- No, no, no!
- We love you guys.

926
00:46:34,347 --> 00:46:35,849
- You've gotta go.
- You should probably go.

927
00:46:35,916 --> 00:46:37,552
- All right.
- Okay.

928
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:38,818
- We're gonna fix it!
- I got it.

929
00:46:38,885 --> 00:46:40,086
Oh, good Lord.
Oh, good heavens.

930
00:46:44,324 --> 00:46:45,492
Dude, what now?

931
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:46,927
The watch says
sometimes things

932
00:46:46,994 --> 00:46:48,762
don't make sense
till the end of the story.

933
00:46:48,829 --> 00:46:50,331
So?

934
00:46:50,398 --> 00:46:52,700
Maybe we gotta go all the way
to the end to find out, Ted.

935
00:46:52,766 --> 00:46:56,403
Most... non-triumphant.

936
00:46:56,471 --> 00:46:57,905
Pull yourself together.

937
00:46:57,972 --> 00:47:00,007
You're a robot!

938
00:47:00,074 --> 00:47:02,543
<i>Get to where
they're going next and wait.</i>

939
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:05,880
We are running out of time.

940
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:17,724
The myth of Ling Lun
turns out to be true, T.

941
00:47:17,791 --> 00:47:21,228
I know. And she's a she.

942
00:47:42,583 --> 00:47:44,251
Oh.

943
00:47:49,523 --> 00:47:51,324
Hey,
you wanna be in our band?

944
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,896
- Yeah.
- Oh.

945
00:48:04,572 --> 00:48:06,474
Grom.
You're gonna love her.

946
00:48:06,539 --> 00:48:10,010
Ling Lun says she's the
greatest drummer of all time.

947
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:15,083
What?

948
00:48:27,228 --> 00:48:30,998
Hello. Excuse me. Hi.
Miss... Miss Grom...

949
00:48:35,902 --> 00:48:38,939
Well, I'm trying to save
the world, too, Mother.

950
00:48:39,007 --> 00:48:41,809
It's not like your
generation's done that great.

951
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:46,246
It's getting worse and worse
here, if you were wondering.

952
00:48:47,447 --> 00:48:49,216
Ah. Well, the Sahara Desert

953
00:48:49,284 --> 00:48:52,019
just showed up
in San Dimas, Mother.

954
00:48:52,085 --> 00:48:53,120
Queen Elizabeth

955
00:48:53,186 --> 00:48:54,989
is looking right at it.

956
00:48:55,054 --> 00:48:58,925
No. No, I'm not
gonna tell you where I am.

957
00:48:58,992 --> 00:49:00,760
Because how do I know
you won't send

958
00:49:00,827 --> 00:49:03,697
your killer robot
after me, Mom?

959
00:49:07,101 --> 00:49:08,202
I gotta go, Mom.

960
00:49:11,405 --> 00:49:14,474
This is bad.
This is really happening.

961
00:49:14,541 --> 00:49:16,177
What's happening?

962
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:20,181
Whoa! Kid Cudi!

963
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:22,081
Hey, how's it goin', dude?

964
00:49:22,148 --> 00:49:24,719
Can someone please tell me
what the hell is happening?

965
00:49:24,786 --> 00:49:27,021
Basically, all time and space
are about to end

966
00:49:27,088 --> 00:49:30,490
unless their dads come up
with a song by 7:17 p.m.

967
00:49:30,556 --> 00:49:32,492
- Wait. What?
- Wait. What?

968
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:34,228
We thought this was
about the music.

969
00:49:34,295 --> 00:49:37,030
It is. It's also about
the end of space and time.

970
00:49:37,097 --> 00:49:39,565
Dude, this is way worse
than we thought.

971
00:49:39,632 --> 00:49:43,270
So, this is some kind of error
in our holographic dual field?

972
00:49:43,336 --> 00:49:44,572
Or is it a Wilsonian loop

973
00:49:44,637 --> 00:49:46,239
causing a temporal
singularity?

974
00:49:46,306 --> 00:49:47,675
Well, seems to me your

975
00:49:47,742 --> 00:49:49,276
classical tautological
causal circuit.

976
00:49:49,342 --> 00:49:51,411
I don't know. Seems like
textbook entanglement to me.

977
00:49:51,478 --> 00:49:52,879
I must say, your understanding

978
00:49:52,945 --> 00:49:54,815
of our dire circumstance
is most impressive.

979
00:49:54,882 --> 00:49:56,951
You should put it to good use
and help us save reality!

980
00:49:57,018 --> 00:49:58,418
Yeah!

981
00:49:58,485 --> 00:49:59,954
That's great. 'Cause it is
the end of space and time.

982
00:50:00,021 --> 00:50:01,355
Right.

983
00:50:01,422 --> 00:50:03,925
Mr. Armstrong, Mr. Hendrix,
<i>Herr</i> Mozart,

984
00:50:03,992 --> 00:50:06,727
Miss Grom, Miss Ling Lun,
and Mr. Cudi,

985
00:50:06,793 --> 00:50:08,195
we're gonna take you
into our dads' studio

986
00:50:08,262 --> 00:50:09,597
and start practicing.

987
00:50:09,664 --> 00:50:11,065
So that when our dads
get back here

988
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:12,432
with the song
that will unite the world,

989
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:13,434
you guys can play it for 'em.

990
00:50:13,501 --> 00:50:15,069
Sound good?

991
00:50:15,135 --> 00:50:17,871
Let's get practicing.

992
00:50:19,005 --> 00:50:20,206
Oh.

993
00:50:20,273 --> 00:50:21,909
Bogus.

994
00:50:27,782 --> 00:50:29,383
Oops.

995
00:50:29,449 --> 00:50:31,852
I'm so sorry, Great Leader.

996
00:50:32,452 --> 00:50:34,253
Oh, no.

997
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,857
Oh... Oh, no.

998
00:50:39,626 --> 00:50:40,862
Oh, no.

999
00:50:46,333 --> 00:50:49,168
Are you okay?

1000
00:50:49,235 --> 00:50:50,503
I think so, dude.

1001
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:52,371
Are you okay?

1002
00:50:52,438 --> 00:50:53,641
I think so, dude.

1003
00:50:55,643 --> 00:50:57,411
Dude, where are we?

1004
00:51:04,385 --> 00:51:05,920
Are you guys okay?

1005
00:51:05,987 --> 00:51:08,021
My mother
just had me killed.

1006
00:51:08,088 --> 00:51:11,426
I didn't think she'd actually
do it, but she did.

1007
00:51:22,369 --> 00:51:27,207
Our sincerest apologies that
we're here, great musicians.

1008
00:51:27,273 --> 00:51:30,210
We just wanted
to help our dads.

1009
00:51:31,043 --> 00:51:35,148
Which we clearly
utterly failed at.

1010
00:51:54,469 --> 00:51:55,769
Time?

1011
00:51:56,704 --> 00:51:58,806
6:48 p.m.

1012
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:08,082
Whoa.

1013
00:52:14,288 --> 00:52:15,757
Dude!

1014
00:52:17,224 --> 00:52:19,693
Are Jo and Liz here?

1015
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,796
Yes.

1016
00:52:27,735 --> 00:52:29,771
And no.

1017
00:52:32,505 --> 00:52:34,540
What did you mean

1018
00:52:34,608 --> 00:52:37,445
"yes and no"?

1019
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:40,847
There are infinite pasts.

1020
00:52:40,914 --> 00:52:45,918
Each is entangled
with infinite futures.

1021
00:52:45,985 --> 00:52:47,653
So, what are you sayin'?

1022
00:52:47,721 --> 00:52:50,056
Where you end up...

1023
00:52:50,556 --> 00:52:52,292
all depends...

1024
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,461
on what happens...

1025
00:52:54,527 --> 00:52:56,163
with this.

1026
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:57,530
Is that...

1027
00:52:57,597 --> 00:53:01,501
It's the answer to everything.

1028
00:53:03,637 --> 00:53:04,972
It's called...

1029
00:53:05,806 --> 00:53:08,909
<i>Face The Music.</i>

1030
00:53:15,248 --> 00:53:16,683
Dudes...

1031
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:18,751
who is that on guitar?

1032
00:53:18,818 --> 00:53:21,322
It's you two.

1033
00:53:21,889 --> 00:53:23,757
It is us.

1034
00:53:31,797 --> 00:53:34,134
<i>Face The Music.</i>

1035
00:53:36,003 --> 00:53:37,671
Preston/Logan!

1036
00:53:37,737 --> 00:53:42,309
Recorded at 7:17 p.m.

1037
00:53:42,376 --> 00:53:45,913
At MP 46.

1038
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:49,248
It's in your hands now.

1039
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:52,485
Go make it happen.

1040
00:53:52,552 --> 00:53:53,787
Thank you, wise old us's.

1041
00:53:53,853 --> 00:53:55,355
Yeah.

1042
00:54:04,331 --> 00:54:07,535
I just wanna say
thank you, Bill,

1043
00:54:07,601 --> 00:54:10,403
for all the times
you've been there for me.

1044
00:54:11,972 --> 00:54:15,642
I feel like I never really
knew you, Ted.

1045
00:54:15,708 --> 00:54:17,377
Oh.

1046
00:54:17,445 --> 00:54:20,046
That's my fault.

1047
00:54:20,112 --> 00:54:23,616
I never truly opened
myself up to you.

1048
00:54:23,682 --> 00:54:28,322
The truth is, I looked at you
and saw myself.

1049
00:54:29,121 --> 00:54:33,360
Yeah. I know. Me, too.

1050
00:54:33,427 --> 00:54:38,666
I'm sorry for the times
I let you down, Bill.

1051
00:54:38,731 --> 00:54:40,934
You never have, Bill.

1052
00:54:41,735 --> 00:54:44,070
You never have.

1053
00:54:53,547 --> 00:54:56,284
I'll never forget you, Bill.

1054
00:54:56,650 --> 00:54:58,152
Ever.

1055
00:55:00,653 --> 00:55:03,123
Catch you later, Ted.

1056
00:55:09,463 --> 00:55:12,432
Catch you later, Bill and Ted.

1057
00:55:19,672 --> 00:55:21,407
They're nice boys.

1058
00:55:21,474 --> 00:55:23,110
Yeah.

1059
00:55:23,943 --> 00:55:26,612
Dude! We got the actual
real song!

1060
00:55:26,679 --> 00:55:28,214
Now alls we gotta do
is figure out

1061
00:55:28,282 --> 00:55:29,916
how to unite
the whole world with it.

1062
00:55:29,983 --> 00:55:31,285
And save reality.

1063
00:55:31,351 --> 00:55:32,652
Yeah.

1064
00:55:33,186 --> 00:55:34,655
- Dude!
- What?

1065
00:55:34,722 --> 00:55:36,957
The booth is gone.

1066
00:55:37,023 --> 00:55:38,391
What?

1067
00:55:38,458 --> 00:55:39,925
Where did it go?

1068
00:55:39,992 --> 00:55:43,297
I don't know. Let's go back
and ask those wise old us's.

1069
00:55:43,362 --> 00:55:45,598
Yeah. I hope
we're still alive.

1070
00:55:48,867 --> 00:55:50,436
Freeze, Preston/Logan.

1071
00:55:50,503 --> 00:55:52,605
Oh, this is exactly
what we don't need right now.

1072
00:55:52,672 --> 00:55:55,608
We can't. We gotta get back
to the present, like, now.

1073
00:55:55,675 --> 00:55:57,878
Yeah. Look, we know
you were sent here

1074
00:55:57,945 --> 00:55:59,446
to kill us if we didn't have
the song.

1075
00:55:59,512 --> 00:56:03,351
But we actually do have
the song now, so...

1076
00:56:03,951 --> 00:56:06,153
Wait. You have the song?

1077
00:56:08,221 --> 00:56:09,757
Oh...

1078
00:56:10,623 --> 00:56:12,259
Uh...

1079
00:56:12,326 --> 00:56:14,661
Mistakes were made.

1080
00:56:15,795 --> 00:56:17,463
Apologies are given.

1081
00:56:17,530 --> 00:56:20,933
You're forgiven. No problem.
But we gotta go, robot dude.

1082
00:56:21,001 --> 00:56:24,271
Wait! No, must expiate guilt.

1083
00:56:24,338 --> 00:56:27,040
For what? We're fine, dude.
Let us go!

1084
00:56:27,106 --> 00:56:30,043
For... murdering family.

1085
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:32,112
Wait. What?

1086
00:56:32,179 --> 00:56:34,648
What are you talking about?

1087
00:56:34,713 --> 00:56:38,018
I lasered your daughters.

1088
00:56:38,085 --> 00:56:39,219
You lasered them?

1089
00:56:39,286 --> 00:56:41,288
You lasered our daughters?

1090
00:56:41,353 --> 00:56:42,955
Where are they?

1091
00:56:43,023 --> 00:56:44,791
Daughters are...

1092
00:56:45,458 --> 00:56:46,525
in Hell.

1093
00:56:46,592 --> 00:56:49,362
You sent our daughters
to Hell?

1094
00:56:52,099 --> 00:56:53,667
We have to go get them.

1095
00:56:54,601 --> 00:56:56,170
Shoot us.

1096
00:56:56,237 --> 00:56:59,706
I can't shoot you.
You have the song.

1097
00:57:00,974 --> 00:57:02,442
Well, guess what?

1098
00:57:02,509 --> 00:57:04,110
Now there's no song.

1099
00:57:04,177 --> 00:57:06,679
Now you got
no choice, Robot.

1100
00:57:06,746 --> 00:57:08,481
You gotta kill us!

1101
00:57:18,525 --> 00:57:20,795
Can no longer take life.

1102
00:57:21,161 --> 00:57:22,361
What?

1103
00:57:22,429 --> 00:57:24,631
Failure. Failure.
Failure. Failure.

1104
00:57:24,697 --> 00:57:27,734
Dude, we need this guy
to laser us

1105
00:57:27,802 --> 00:57:29,036
but he appears to be having

1106
00:57:29,101 --> 00:57:31,038
some kind of
nervous breakdown.

1107
00:57:31,105 --> 00:57:34,039
Shoot us, Robot!

1108
00:57:34,106 --> 00:57:35,442
I can't.
I'm a failure.

1109
00:57:35,509 --> 00:57:37,211
I don't even deserve to live,
you know?

1110
00:57:37,277 --> 00:57:38,311
Shoot us!

1111
00:57:38,378 --> 00:57:40,146
Can't do it. Shoot myself.

1112
00:57:40,213 --> 00:57:41,648
- Wait, don't!
- You can't!

1113
00:57:41,715 --> 00:57:43,784
We gotta go
save Billie and Thea.

1114
00:57:43,851 --> 00:57:45,719
- Let's do it!
- Yeah.

1115
00:57:45,786 --> 00:57:49,021
I'm so sorry!
Goodbye, cruel world!

1116
00:57:54,827 --> 00:57:55,963
It worked!

1117
00:57:56,030 --> 00:57:57,531
Yeah!

1118
00:58:01,867 --> 00:58:03,770
...world!

1119
00:58:04,971 --> 00:58:06,206
That is unexpected.

1120
00:58:06,273 --> 00:58:08,876
Yeah. How can a robot
even die?

1121
00:58:08,942 --> 00:58:10,610
Let's find the girls.

1122
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:13,746
Can I come with you?

1123
00:58:15,382 --> 00:58:16,883
He did kill us.

1124
00:58:18,818 --> 00:58:20,488
Come on, Robot!

1125
00:58:21,954 --> 00:58:23,891
Wait. I have a name.

1126
00:58:24,692 --> 00:58:26,559
It's Dennis.

1127
00:58:27,226 --> 00:58:28,862
Dennis McCoy.

1128
00:58:28,929 --> 00:58:31,164
Okay. Let's go, Dennis McCoy.

1129
00:58:31,231 --> 00:58:32,666
- Thea!
- Billie!

1130
00:58:32,733 --> 00:58:35,836
Dennis Caleb McCoy.
That's the full name.

1131
00:58:35,902 --> 00:58:38,271
Let's go, dude!

1132
00:58:38,338 --> 00:58:41,208
I feel gratitude. Gratitude.

1133
00:58:41,275 --> 00:58:42,608
Okay, we get it.

1134
00:58:42,675 --> 00:58:44,277
You're a grateful,
totally insecure,

1135
00:58:44,344 --> 00:58:47,780
somehow dead robot
named Dennis Caleb McCoy.

1136
00:58:47,847 --> 00:58:50,217
- Thea!
- Billie!

1137
00:58:51,483 --> 00:58:53,252
How're we gonna
find them, dude?

1138
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:54,454
I don't know, dude.

1139
00:58:54,521 --> 00:58:57,224
Yeah, I don't even know, dude.

1140
00:58:59,291 --> 00:59:02,496
Thea! Billie!

1141
00:59:05,532 --> 00:59:07,233
Great Leader?

1142
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:10,171
Bill and Ted are dead.
Did it work?

1143
00:59:13,672 --> 00:59:15,107
No.

1144
00:59:15,175 --> 00:59:17,278
Nothing is working.

1145
00:59:19,579 --> 00:59:20,813
Oh...

1146
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,384
They were very nice.
Very nice. Good group.

1147
00:59:23,449 --> 00:59:25,985
- Group?
- Yeah. They went that way.

1148
00:59:26,052 --> 00:59:27,487
Thanks, demons.

1149
00:59:27,554 --> 00:59:28,822
- You betcha.
- Enjoy Hell, y'all.

1150
00:59:28,889 --> 00:59:30,057
- Thanks, demons.
- Have a good time, boys.

1151
00:59:30,123 --> 00:59:31,090
I know that's strange.

1152
00:59:31,157 --> 00:59:32,259
What is that, a robot?

1153
00:59:32,326 --> 00:59:34,461
Yeah, that's a robot in Hell.

1154
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:36,262
- Thea?
- Billie?

1155
00:59:36,329 --> 00:59:38,731
- Thea?
- Billie!

1156
00:59:38,797 --> 00:59:40,266
No!

1157
00:59:40,333 --> 00:59:42,368
- Apology not accepted, Mother.
- Kelly?

1158
00:59:42,434 --> 00:59:45,940
Ah! Bill and Ted are here.
Did it work, Mom?

1159
00:59:46,673 --> 00:59:48,909
Yeah. That's what I thought.

1160
00:59:48,974 --> 00:59:49,976
Where are they?

1161
00:59:50,043 --> 00:59:51,778
They're that way.

1162
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:54,948
I'm Dennis Caleb McCoy.
I am so...

1163
00:59:55,014 --> 00:59:57,616
No! No.

1164
00:59:57,684 --> 01:00:00,353
Oh, yeah. This is way worse
than the Christmas incident.

1165
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:03,990
And you named him Dennis?
After my ex?

1166
01:00:04,056 --> 01:00:05,792
Get outta here!

1167
01:00:16,268 --> 01:00:18,638
- Thea! Billie!
- Billie! Thea!

1168
01:00:18,706 --> 01:00:20,274
Dads!

1169
01:00:24,878 --> 01:00:26,013
Dads!

1170
01:00:27,981 --> 01:00:29,116
How're you doin'?

1171
01:00:29,182 --> 01:00:30,951
Well, you know, we're dead.

1172
01:00:31,018 --> 01:00:32,251
And we're in Hell.

1173
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:33,853
But how're you doin'?

1174
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:34,988
We're good!

1175
01:00:35,054 --> 01:00:36,923
Yeah. Look who we found.

1176
01:00:37,623 --> 01:00:38,857
Dad?

1177
01:00:38,925 --> 01:00:40,193
Hi, Ted.

1178
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:43,196
I was wrong.
I mean, you're here.

1179
01:00:43,262 --> 01:00:46,766
Which implies that you also
traveled through time

1180
01:00:46,833 --> 01:00:50,537
and that your wives actually
are princesses.

1181
01:00:50,603 --> 01:00:53,205
All of which proves
that it is imperative

1182
01:00:53,273 --> 01:00:54,875
that you write the song

1183
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:57,476
that will
unite the entire world.

1184
01:00:57,543 --> 01:00:59,945
And save reality.

1185
01:01:00,012 --> 01:01:01,213
Wait, is that new?

1186
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,983
Yeah.

1187
01:01:03,050 --> 01:01:06,619
Well, then, I should help you
instead of criticizing you.

1188
01:01:06,686 --> 01:01:11,057
And I am very,
very, very sorry.

1189
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:12,659
Thanks, Dad!

1190
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,128
Yeah, thanks, Chief Logan!

1191
01:01:15,195 --> 01:01:16,997
I wasn't talking to you, Bill.

1192
01:01:17,063 --> 01:01:19,031
Oh. Cool.

1193
01:01:19,099 --> 01:01:21,902
Well, Dads, this is the band
we put together for you.

1194
01:01:21,967 --> 01:01:24,770
This is Jimi Hendrix,
Louis Armstrong...

1195
01:01:24,838 --> 01:01:28,575
And Mozart,
and Ling Lun, and Grom.

1196
01:01:29,443 --> 01:01:31,278
A pleasure, gentlemen.

1197
01:01:31,344 --> 01:01:33,746
You raised
two fine young girls.

1198
01:01:33,813 --> 01:01:35,449
- Thank you.
- And this is Kid Cudi

1199
01:01:35,516 --> 01:01:37,384
who's not technically
a historical figure.

1200
01:01:37,449 --> 01:01:39,519
- Kinda am now, I think.
- Yeah.

1201
01:01:39,585 --> 01:01:41,721
It's a great honor
to meet you all.

1202
01:01:41,789 --> 01:01:46,826
Yeah. Welcome to,
and sorry about, Hell.

1203
01:01:46,893 --> 01:01:47,894
My bad.

1204
01:01:50,697 --> 01:01:54,000
Oh.
That's Dennis Caleb McCoy.

1205
01:01:54,067 --> 01:01:57,070
We've met. He killed us.

1206
01:01:57,137 --> 01:01:59,005
I'm really sorry

1207
01:01:59,072 --> 01:02:01,375
that I lasered you all.

1208
01:02:01,442 --> 01:02:03,208
And...

1209
01:02:03,275 --> 01:02:05,311
I just need to tell you...

1210
01:02:05,378 --> 01:02:10,049
My name is
Dennis Caleb McCoy, and...

1211
01:02:10,117 --> 01:02:12,119
Thank you, Dennis.

1212
01:02:12,186 --> 01:02:14,221
Well, thanks for
coming to get us.

1213
01:02:14,288 --> 01:02:15,387
How're we gonna
get outta here?

1214
01:02:15,454 --> 01:02:16,923
We're gonna go talk to Death.

1215
01:02:16,989 --> 01:02:19,892
Oh. Well, isn't he still mad
at you guys?

1216
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,260
Oh, yeah.

1217
01:02:21,327 --> 01:02:23,061
- And we're still mad at him.
- Yeah.

1218
01:02:23,128 --> 01:02:24,563
Oh.

1219
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:25,931
Nineteen minutes.

1220
01:02:25,998 --> 01:02:27,734
Everyone, follow us.

1221
01:02:31,471 --> 01:02:33,306
Yes way!

1222
01:02:34,407 --> 01:02:37,943
Best 75 out of 81.

1223
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:40,313
Is he playing Hopscotch
by himself?

1224
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:41,581
I have
bested you again.

1225
01:02:41,648 --> 01:02:44,117
He looks miserable, dude.

1226
01:02:44,184 --> 01:02:46,119
Yes!

1227
01:02:46,186 --> 01:02:47,420
Dude, he's cheating!

1228
01:02:47,487 --> 01:02:48,956
Yes!

1229
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:52,993
- Take a hike.
- Let's go, dude.

1230
01:02:53,059 --> 01:02:54,159
Good luck, Dads.

1231
01:02:54,226 --> 01:02:55,194
- Be sweet.
- Okay.

1232
01:02:55,262 --> 01:02:56,764
Okay.

1233
01:03:01,034 --> 01:03:02,769
Hey, Death.

1234
01:03:03,835 --> 01:03:06,973
Why, if it isn't
the Wyld Stallyns.

1235
01:03:08,307 --> 01:03:10,177
Have you come to sue me again?

1236
01:03:10,244 --> 01:03:12,045
No, Death. Not at all.

1237
01:03:12,112 --> 01:03:14,715
No. We just need
to talk to you, Death.

1238
01:03:15,215 --> 01:03:17,584
Talk to the hand.

1239
01:03:18,918 --> 01:03:21,054
It will only take
a second, dude.

1240
01:03:22,489 --> 01:03:24,191
- Death!
- Come on, dude.

1241
01:03:28,527 --> 01:03:29,628
Who is it?

1242
01:03:29,695 --> 01:03:31,632
Bill and Ted!

1243
01:03:31,697 --> 01:03:35,467
What? Did your
restraining order run out?

1244
01:03:35,534 --> 01:03:37,503
Did the judge change his mind?

1245
01:03:37,570 --> 01:03:41,106
So, now I am allowed
to get close to you? Hmm?

1246
01:03:41,173 --> 01:03:42,208
Is this too close?

1247
01:03:42,275 --> 01:03:43,542
Death.

1248
01:03:43,610 --> 01:03:45,746
We didn't want to sue you,
dude.

1249
01:03:45,811 --> 01:03:48,882
- Remember, be sweet, dude.
- You're right.

1250
01:03:48,947 --> 01:03:52,684
You tried to take the name
Wyld Stallyns.

1251
01:03:52,751 --> 01:03:54,721
I was Wyld Stallyns.

1252
01:03:54,788 --> 01:03:56,255
What are you talking about?

1253
01:03:56,322 --> 01:03:58,990
You kicked me out
because you was jealous of me.

1254
01:03:59,057 --> 01:04:00,726
- No, no, no, dude.
- Yes, yes, yes.

1255
01:04:00,793 --> 01:04:02,695
You quit the band
to go out on your own!

1256
01:04:02,762 --> 01:04:04,264
You wouldn't let me play!

1257
01:04:04,331 --> 01:04:07,266
Dude, you were playing
40-minute bass solos.

1258
01:04:07,333 --> 01:04:08,701
No one but you could play!

1259
01:04:08,768 --> 01:04:11,304
I was in the groove!

1260
01:04:11,371 --> 01:04:13,773
- What?
- Those 40-minute solos,

1261
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:17,009
that was the highlight
of your shows.

1262
01:04:17,077 --> 01:04:20,747
It's no wonder
you went down in the tubes.

1263
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:26,586
What're we gonna do?

1264
01:04:27,286 --> 01:04:28,788
Oh...

1265
01:04:28,855 --> 01:04:30,824
Death, the reason
we came here is 'cause

1266
01:04:30,891 --> 01:04:32,659
we have to play a song
at some place

1267
01:04:32,726 --> 01:04:33,793
called MP 46,

1268
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:35,662
- like, right now.
- Hmm.

1269
01:04:35,728 --> 01:04:39,364
All of time is gonna fold
in on itself, dude.

1270
01:04:39,431 --> 01:04:42,001
I have been demoted down here

1271
01:04:42,068 --> 01:04:46,405
because I took two so-called
"friends" back up

1272
01:04:46,472 --> 01:04:48,641
who should not have gone
back up.

1273
01:04:48,708 --> 01:04:50,742
So, if that is why
you're here...

1274
01:04:50,809 --> 01:04:54,081
Sorry, not sorry.

1275
01:04:54,947 --> 01:04:56,250
Bye!

1276
01:04:57,483 --> 01:04:59,653
- What now?
- I don't know, dude.

1277
01:04:59,719 --> 01:05:01,820
Dads, we have an idea.

1278
01:05:01,887 --> 01:05:03,556
You mind if we try?

1279
01:05:03,623 --> 01:05:05,057
I mean, the dude is the most
rad bass player, like, ever.

1280
01:05:05,125 --> 01:05:06,592
Yeah.

1281
01:05:08,161 --> 01:05:09,229
Please.

1282
01:05:09,295 --> 01:05:11,030
- Okay.
- Come on.

1283
01:05:11,097 --> 01:05:13,300
- All right.
- He's kind of a dick.

1284
01:05:13,367 --> 01:05:15,068
Okay.

1285
01:05:23,775 --> 01:05:27,880
Dads, we think
you should wait outside.

1286
01:05:44,998 --> 01:05:47,367
- Oh.
- Excuse us, Mr. Death, sir.

1287
01:05:47,434 --> 01:05:49,403
It's good to see you again,
Mr. Death, sir.

1288
01:05:49,469 --> 01:05:52,704
Well, if it isn't Little Bill
and Little Ted.

1289
01:05:52,771 --> 01:05:55,208
We're still your hugest fans.

1290
01:05:55,275 --> 01:05:56,610
Yeah.

1291
01:05:57,744 --> 01:05:59,612
Don't fudge with me.

1292
01:05:59,679 --> 01:06:00,913
We're not fudging
with you, sir.

1293
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:02,581
- It's legit.
- Yeah.

1294
01:06:02,648 --> 01:06:03,817
- Really?
- Yeah.

1295
01:06:03,884 --> 01:06:05,184
I mean, <i>The Lonely Soul Surfer</i>

1296
01:06:05,251 --> 01:06:08,188
was the most underrated album
in 1998.

1297
01:06:08,253 --> 01:06:09,855
The critics hated it.

1298
01:06:09,922 --> 01:06:11,157
Well, they just weren't ready

1299
01:06:11,224 --> 01:06:12,792
for an album
that was all bass.

1300
01:06:12,858 --> 01:06:15,929
"It was all over the place,"
they said.

1301
01:06:15,994 --> 01:06:20,365
"It was a raging,
confused mess," they said.

1302
01:06:20,432 --> 01:06:25,471
"It was even worse than
<i>Pale on Pale,"</i> they said.

1303
01:06:25,538 --> 01:06:27,574
Well...

1304
01:06:27,641 --> 01:06:30,876
It was, in parts.

1305
01:06:30,943 --> 01:06:32,579
But in other parts...

1306
01:06:32,646 --> 01:06:34,314
The outro
in <i>I'll Never Be Loved</i>

1307
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:36,982
is the most bodacious.

1308
01:06:37,050 --> 01:06:38,618
I mean, the last three bars

1309
01:06:38,684 --> 01:06:41,188
before the chorus
in <i>Too Pale to Cry...</i>

1310
01:06:41,253 --> 01:06:43,089
Oh, well...

1311
01:06:43,155 --> 01:06:47,960
What did you think of the hook
in <i>Boogie Down With Doctor D?</i>

1312
01:06:48,027 --> 01:06:49,961
What can we even say?

1313
01:06:50,028 --> 01:06:53,565
Insane. We've never seen
left-hand technique like that.

1314
01:06:53,632 --> 01:06:56,402
I know! I was self-taught.

1315
01:06:56,469 --> 01:07:00,173
You have some crazy,
crazy skills, dude!

1316
01:07:00,239 --> 01:07:02,708
Well...

1317
01:07:02,775 --> 01:07:04,877
- You know what you need?
- Hmm?

1318
01:07:05,945 --> 01:07:08,514
You just need a band.

1319
01:07:08,581 --> 01:07:10,250
And the band needs you.

1320
01:07:12,251 --> 01:07:13,253
Oh.

1321
01:07:13,318 --> 01:07:15,188
- T?
- B.

1322
01:07:19,391 --> 01:07:20,860
Come on in.

1323
01:07:21,762 --> 01:07:23,329
Dads,

1324
01:07:23,396 --> 01:07:26,432
is there something you would
like to say to Death?

1325
01:07:26,498 --> 01:07:29,702
Oh...

1326
01:07:41,114 --> 01:07:45,150
We're sorry for how things
went between us, Death.

1327
01:07:45,217 --> 01:07:46,518
Yeah.

1328
01:07:46,585 --> 01:07:48,387
Sincerely sorry.

1329
01:07:50,090 --> 01:07:55,295
I am sorry that fame
went to my head.

1330
01:07:56,563 --> 01:07:59,132
It's very intoxicating.

1331
01:08:00,032 --> 01:08:04,036
We really did love playing
with you, dude.

1332
01:08:04,938 --> 01:08:07,239
We really did rock, didn't we?

1333
01:08:07,306 --> 01:08:09,909
We definitely did.

1334
01:08:09,976 --> 01:08:12,412
And if it's not too late,
Death...

1335
01:08:12,478 --> 01:08:13,812
Yeah?

1336
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:17,583
Would you
consider rejoining...

1337
01:08:17,649 --> 01:08:20,753
Wyld Stallyns?

1338
01:08:21,921 --> 01:08:24,191
Oh... I...

1339
01:08:31,631 --> 01:08:33,600
I suppose.

1340
01:08:49,649 --> 01:08:51,450
Okay, let's go!

1341
01:08:51,516 --> 01:08:53,818
Right. Right.

1342
01:08:58,524 --> 01:09:01,094
It's Dennis. Hi.

1343
01:09:03,996 --> 01:09:05,663
- I got lost.
- Get in, Dennis.

1344
01:09:05,730 --> 01:09:07,900
Okay.
Thank you, guys.

1345
01:09:07,966 --> 01:09:09,534
- Hey, Kid Cudi.
- Hey, Dennis.

1346
01:09:09,601 --> 01:09:11,037
Oh, hello. Hello, everyone.

1347
01:09:11,104 --> 01:09:13,506
Hey. Hey. Yeah, okay, friends.

1348
01:09:13,573 --> 01:09:15,742
Let's rock!

1349
01:09:23,216 --> 01:09:26,719
It was cool
when you said, "Let's rock,"

1350
01:09:26,786 --> 01:09:29,454
because it made me
want to rock.

1351
01:09:29,521 --> 01:09:31,056
Uh-huh.

1352
01:09:31,123 --> 01:09:33,659
You don't just get to rock.

1353
01:09:33,726 --> 01:09:36,828
You got to earn the right
to rock.

1354
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:40,532
Dude! We got 11 minutes.

1355
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:42,802
Anyone know where MP 46 is?

1356
01:09:42,868 --> 01:09:44,304
Depends on your perspective.

1357
01:09:44,371 --> 01:09:46,271
To really dig the groove
of the quantum realm,

1358
01:09:46,338 --> 01:09:48,340
you gotta choose a place
to dig it from.

1359
01:09:48,407 --> 01:09:49,842
Dig?

1360
01:09:51,176 --> 01:09:53,947
Anyone know where MP 46 is?

1361
01:10:00,286 --> 01:10:02,288
We're never gonna
make our flight.

1362
01:10:07,993 --> 01:10:10,662
Deac, Deac.
Look at that.

1363
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,536
Whoa!

1364
01:10:17,002 --> 01:10:18,505
I got this.

1365
01:10:19,773 --> 01:10:21,274
Stop!

1366
01:10:25,712 --> 01:10:27,447
We're back!

1367
01:10:27,514 --> 01:10:28,949
What?

1368
01:10:31,417 --> 01:10:32,885
This is bad.

1369
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:37,056
Really bad.

1370
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:40,226
Okay, guys, let's go!

1371
01:10:42,795 --> 01:10:44,396
Come on!

1372
01:10:44,463 --> 01:10:46,131
Come on, Mozart.

1373
01:10:48,333 --> 01:10:49,734
Oh, Ted! Even if we knew

1374
01:10:49,801 --> 01:10:51,237
where we were
supposed to play,

1375
01:10:51,304 --> 01:10:53,773
there's no way
we'd ever get there in time.

1376
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,842
Bill, look!

1377
01:10:55,908 --> 01:10:58,310
This is MP 46?
It makes no sense.

1378
01:10:58,377 --> 01:11:00,913
How can the song happen
right here?

1379
01:11:01,881 --> 01:11:04,618
Because this is where
it happened.

1380
01:11:05,217 --> 01:11:06,485
Ted, you're right, dude!

1381
01:11:06,552 --> 01:11:09,956
But, dude,
what're we gonna play?

1382
01:11:10,856 --> 01:11:12,591
I don't know, dude.

1383
01:11:16,194 --> 01:11:19,164
Uh, Bill and Ted?
I saved these.

1384
01:11:19,231 --> 01:11:21,000
I'm not sure if...

1385
01:11:21,067 --> 01:11:23,336
they're of any use, but...

1386
01:11:23,402 --> 01:11:25,538
- Thanks, Dennis.
- Dads!

1387
01:11:25,604 --> 01:11:27,606
Dads! MP 46.

1388
01:11:27,673 --> 01:11:29,007
And the band is ready to play.

1389
01:11:29,073 --> 01:11:31,577
Alls we need is the song.

1390
01:11:36,815 --> 01:11:38,516
Thea.

1391
01:11:38,583 --> 01:11:39,918
Billie.

1392
01:11:39,985 --> 01:11:43,288
We don't know
how to tell you this.

1393
01:11:43,355 --> 01:11:45,992
We don't have the song.

1394
01:11:47,025 --> 01:11:48,394
Wait...

1395
01:11:48,795 --> 01:11:50,396
You don't?

1396
01:11:51,997 --> 01:11:53,698
No.

1397
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:55,568
We're sorry.

1398
01:11:55,635 --> 01:11:57,470
We're sorry, Dads.

1399
01:11:57,536 --> 01:12:00,506
Yeah, we really wanted to
help you out with this.

1400
01:12:05,478 --> 01:12:08,515
Dude, you seeing
what I'm seeing?

1401
01:12:12,717 --> 01:12:14,253
Preston?

1402
01:12:14,753 --> 01:12:16,355
Logan?

1403
01:12:18,623 --> 01:12:21,193
Preston/Logan.

1404
01:12:22,695 --> 01:12:24,463
Whoa.

1405
01:12:25,331 --> 01:12:27,634
What is it, Dads?

1406
01:12:27,699 --> 01:12:29,469
It's you!

1407
01:12:29,536 --> 01:12:30,869
What?

1408
01:12:30,936 --> 01:12:33,939
It was you the whole time.
We just didn't see it.

1409
01:12:34,006 --> 01:12:35,274
We can't write music.

1410
01:12:35,341 --> 01:12:37,743
Whatever...
We just listen to stuff.

1411
01:12:37,810 --> 01:12:39,212
From things we like.

1412
01:12:39,278 --> 01:12:40,546
And we just kind of
put stuff together.

1413
01:12:40,613 --> 01:12:42,148
Yeah, maybe you just
listen a little,

1414
01:12:42,213 --> 01:12:43,716
make things you like.

1415
01:12:43,783 --> 01:12:45,484
And put it all together.

1416
01:12:45,551 --> 01:12:48,854
Girls, you're not here
to back us.

1417
01:12:48,921 --> 01:12:51,758
We're here to back you.

1418
01:12:51,824 --> 01:12:53,659
We're your band.

1419
01:12:54,726 --> 01:12:56,095
Whoa.

1420
01:12:59,731 --> 01:13:01,333
Follow us!

1421
01:13:05,203 --> 01:13:06,805
Here you go. Instruments!

1422
01:13:06,872 --> 01:13:08,373
Wow!

1423
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:11,577
Dude, I just thought
of something.

1424
01:13:11,644 --> 01:13:12,945
What is it, Ted?

1425
01:13:13,011 --> 01:13:15,447
How is just listening
to a song...

1426
01:13:15,515 --> 01:13:17,850
...gonna unite
the whole world...

1427
01:13:17,917 --> 01:13:20,086
...throughout all of time?

1428
01:13:20,787 --> 01:13:23,323
That is a good question, dude.

1429
01:13:27,527 --> 01:13:29,662
It's almost like
they'd all have to hear it

1430
01:13:29,729 --> 01:13:31,264
in order to play it.

1431
01:13:31,331 --> 01:13:33,231
Ted, of course! That's how
we're gonna unite 'em.

1432
01:13:33,297 --> 01:13:34,733
We get 'em to play along.

1433
01:13:34,801 --> 01:13:36,336
Well, if that's true,
alls we gotta do is

1434
01:13:36,403 --> 01:13:37,737
get to everyone
throughout all time.

1435
01:13:37,804 --> 01:13:40,072
Yeah, and get 'em instruments,
dude.

1436
01:13:40,139 --> 01:13:42,740
In seven minutes
and 25 seconds.

1437
01:13:42,807 --> 01:13:44,275
What about a tambourine?

1438
01:13:44,342 --> 01:13:46,311
I mean, how hard can it be
to rock with that?

1439
01:13:46,378 --> 01:13:49,515
Tambourine is not as easy
as it looks.

1440
01:13:49,582 --> 01:13:52,419
What about dancing?
I'm a very gifted dancer.

1441
01:13:52,484 --> 01:13:53,985
You dance?

1442
01:13:54,052 --> 01:13:55,621
- Mmm-hmm.
- Really?

1443
01:13:55,688 --> 01:13:59,792
Why don't you go over there
and rehearse your dance?

1444
01:14:00,092 --> 01:14:01,528
Okay.

1445
01:14:02,328 --> 01:14:03,762
Dude, we have no power!

1446
01:14:03,828 --> 01:14:05,030
Say no more. On it.

1447
01:14:05,097 --> 01:14:06,364
Okay.

1448
01:14:20,712 --> 01:14:22,247
There! Oh, Jo.

1449
01:14:22,314 --> 01:14:23,815
- Theodore.
- William!

1450
01:14:23,882 --> 01:14:25,016
- Joanna!
- Liz!

1451
01:14:25,083 --> 01:14:26,885
Hi.

1452
01:14:26,952 --> 01:14:29,789
Did you find a reality where
we're all happy together?

1453
01:14:29,855 --> 01:14:31,222
We did.

1454
01:14:31,289 --> 01:14:34,594
We realized we're happiest
in this reality.

1455
01:14:34,661 --> 01:14:36,296
Sweet!

1456
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:41,533
Now, um, did we hear you say
something about

1457
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:44,537
distributing instruments
all throughout time?

1458
01:14:44,604 --> 01:14:45,637
Ready, T?

1459
01:14:45,703 --> 01:14:48,541
Five, six,
five, six, seven, eight!

1460
01:14:54,412 --> 01:14:57,382
Oh, my God, what's happening?

1461
01:14:58,015 --> 01:14:59,618
Excuse me, Mr. Cudi, sir?

1462
01:14:59,685 --> 01:15:01,921
Our wives just traveled
through multiple realities.

1463
01:15:01,987 --> 01:15:03,256
And in doing so,
they realized...

1464
01:15:03,322 --> 01:15:04,457
They're all happening

1465
01:15:04,523 --> 01:15:05,757
- simultaneously.
- Simultaneously.

1466
01:15:05,824 --> 01:15:07,359
Do we need individual us's

1467
01:15:07,426 --> 01:15:09,595
to take instruments
to infinite places?

1468
01:15:09,662 --> 01:15:13,032
Okay. See, contrary to what
some have argued,

1469
01:15:13,099 --> 01:15:14,801
universal wave function is,

1470
01:15:14,868 --> 01:15:16,302
epistemologically speaking,

1471
01:15:16,368 --> 01:15:17,769
both cyclic and separating.
In other words...

1472
01:15:17,836 --> 01:15:19,771
Excuse me, Kid Cudi.
I don't mean to be rude,

1473
01:15:19,838 --> 01:15:22,341
but we have, like,
four and a half minutes.

1474
01:15:23,676 --> 01:15:28,180
Madam. Madam! We have to go.
It's not safe to be in here.

1475
01:15:28,247 --> 01:15:30,950
Where were you thinking
of going?

1476
01:15:45,965 --> 01:15:47,833
I think it's a lunar eclipse.

1477
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:49,902
That is not lunar, you guys.

1478
01:15:55,239 --> 01:15:57,208
This is a disaster, T.

1479
01:15:57,275 --> 01:15:59,043
What are we gonna do, B?

1480
01:16:06,051 --> 01:16:07,987
Stop!

1481
01:16:08,054 --> 01:16:10,823
All you need to do is go
in the quantum superposition

1482
01:16:10,890 --> 01:16:12,057
with multiple realities.

1483
01:16:12,123 --> 01:16:13,858
But how?

1484
01:16:13,926 --> 01:16:16,162
Dudes, the booth is obviously
a tunnel to the quantum realm.

1485
01:16:16,229 --> 01:16:17,695
Go, go, go!

1486
01:16:17,762 --> 01:16:19,564
- Thank you, Mr. Cudi!
- Thank you, Mr. Cudi!

1487
01:16:19,631 --> 01:16:20,865
Station.

1488
01:16:20,932 --> 01:16:22,234
Station!

1489
01:16:22,301 --> 01:16:24,304
- Grom!
- Grom, you start!

1490
01:16:25,337 --> 01:16:27,239
- No, no, no...
- Stop, stop!

1491
01:16:27,306 --> 01:16:28,807
Here.

1492
01:16:35,314 --> 01:16:37,717
And now, Death!

1493
01:16:38,650 --> 01:16:41,153
Well... It's...
Maybe something like...

1494
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:42,387
<i>Too Pale to Cry.</i>

1495
01:16:42,453 --> 01:16:44,724
- That last riff?
- Amazing!

1496
01:16:46,925 --> 01:16:48,494
Yeah.

1497
01:16:53,865 --> 01:16:56,635
What're we gonna tell
people to play?

1498
01:16:57,435 --> 01:16:59,505
- We'll be right back.
- Okay.

1499
01:16:59,572 --> 01:17:02,342
Read me the number
for the infinite, dude.

1500
01:17:04,277 --> 01:17:05,411
Six-nine...

1501
01:17:05,478 --> 01:17:06,712
Six-nine...

1502
01:17:06,779 --> 01:17:08,014
Two-nine-nine...

1503
01:17:08,081 --> 01:17:09,882
- How about that concerto?
- Okay, go tell him.

1504
01:17:09,948 --> 01:17:11,384
Mozart.

1505
01:17:14,686 --> 01:17:16,488
Three-four-five-five...

1506
01:17:16,555 --> 01:17:19,525
Five-one-zero-one...

1507
01:17:19,591 --> 01:17:21,192
I already said goodbye
to the girls.

1508
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:22,962
But I wanna stay here
and dance.

1509
01:17:23,029 --> 01:17:24,897
Dennis.

1510
01:17:24,963 --> 01:17:27,032
Good luck,
my excellent friends.

1511
01:17:27,099 --> 01:17:28,801
Thanks, Kelly.

1512
01:17:28,868 --> 01:17:30,136
Later, Dennis.

1513
01:17:30,203 --> 01:17:32,839
My name is Dennis.
Dennis McCoy.

1514
01:17:33,972 --> 01:17:35,440
Two-one-eight.

1515
01:17:35,507 --> 01:17:38,944
Faster, you know?
Yeah! Now, D.

1516
01:17:39,011 --> 01:17:40,579
Oh, yeah.

1517
01:17:41,279 --> 01:17:43,248
Yeah!

1518
01:17:43,315 --> 01:17:45,318
Watch this!

1519
01:17:50,889 --> 01:17:53,359
Jimi, for the win!

1520
01:17:55,193 --> 01:17:56,529
One-eight-two-eight...

1521
01:17:56,595 --> 01:17:57,996
Okay. Okay.
The girls said C major.

1522
01:17:58,064 --> 01:18:00,032
One-hundred thirteen
beats per minute.

1523
01:18:00,099 --> 01:18:02,702
- Got it.
- All right. Yeah.

1524
01:18:02,769 --> 01:18:05,570
Four-five-five. Five-one...

1525
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:23,855
- Four-three-five...
- Guys, maybe just press

1526
01:18:23,922 --> 01:18:24,923
the infinite button.

1527
01:18:24,990 --> 01:18:26,324
Oh, yeah.

1528
01:18:26,391 --> 01:18:28,360
Yeah.

1529
01:18:33,097 --> 01:18:34,367
One last thing.

1530
01:18:34,432 --> 01:18:36,935
I love you, Elizabeth.

1531
01:18:37,002 --> 01:18:38,737
I love you, Joanna.

1532
01:18:38,804 --> 01:18:40,073
We know.

1533
01:18:41,439 --> 01:18:43,741
I love you.

1534
01:18:43,809 --> 01:18:46,445
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay.

1535
01:19:12,003 --> 01:19:13,939
- How's it goin', Deac?
- Whoa!

1536
01:19:14,006 --> 01:19:15,641
- Missy.
- Oh!

1537
01:19:15,707 --> 01:19:18,543
In case you're wondering,
I'm essentially an infinite me.

1538
01:19:18,610 --> 01:19:19,944
Catch you later.

1539
01:19:20,011 --> 01:19:22,081
Outstanding!

1540
01:19:31,490 --> 01:19:32,591
Yeah!

1541
01:19:47,639 --> 01:19:49,775
- Excellent!
- Excellent!

1542
01:19:52,645 --> 01:19:54,781
Dads!

1543
01:20:05,024 --> 01:20:06,492
Wait.

1544
01:20:12,698 --> 01:20:15,902
San Dimas, make some noise!

1545
01:20:26,244 --> 01:20:27,846
Yeah!

1546
01:20:30,149 --> 01:20:32,285
Ten, nine...

1547
01:20:32,350 --> 01:20:34,252
eight, seven...

1548
01:20:34,319 --> 01:20:35,653
six...

1549
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:37,922
- five...
- Dads!

1550
01:20:37,989 --> 01:20:39,291
...four, three...

1551
01:20:39,358 --> 01:20:41,726
two, one.

1552
01:20:51,837 --> 01:20:54,507
Madam, you need to see this.

1553
01:20:59,912 --> 01:21:02,981
Your father would be
so proud of you.

1554
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:15,661
Wow.

1555
01:21:15,728 --> 01:21:16,895
- Bye!
- Bye, Kid Cudi!

1556
01:21:16,962 --> 01:21:18,931
- Bye!
- See ya, Kid Cudi!

1557
01:21:54,033 --> 01:21:55,234
It's working!

1558
01:21:55,301 --> 01:21:56,802
Yeah!

1559
01:22:17,989 --> 01:22:19,625
<i>And so,
it wasn't so much</i>

1560
01:22:19,692 --> 01:22:21,259
<i>the song
that made the difference.</i>

1561
01:22:21,326 --> 01:22:24,697
<i>It was everyone
playing it together.</i>

1562
01:22:26,030 --> 01:22:27,867
<i>And it worked.</i>

1563
01:29:38,697 --> 01:29:40,765
Dude...

1564
01:29:40,832 --> 01:29:44,969
are you dead yet?

1565
01:29:45,036 --> 01:29:47,072
No.

1566
01:29:50,375 --> 01:29:52,444
Are you?

1567
01:29:53,845 --> 01:29:55,981
No.

1568
01:29:56,047 --> 01:30:02,186
There's one more thing
we need to do

1569
01:30:02,253 --> 01:30:04,422
before we go.

1570
01:30:05,791 --> 01:30:07,693
Definitely.

1571
01:30:20,104 --> 01:30:21,605
Ready, Bill?

1572
01:30:21,672 --> 01:30:23,474
Ready, Ted.

1573
01:30:23,908 --> 01:30:25,342
- One...
- Two...

1574
01:30:25,409 --> 01:30:28,546
One, two, three, four!

1575
01:30:56,475 --> 01:30:57,976
Okay.

1576
01:30:58,042 --> 01:30:59,676
Yeah. Okay.

1577
01:30:59,743 --> 01:31:02,113
- Okay.
- Okay.

1578
01:31:15,493 --> 01:31:18,329
- We still got it.
- We still got it.

1579
01:31:18,395 --> 01:31:20,798
- Hey, Bill.
- Yeah?

1580
01:31:27,904 --> 01:31:30,141
Okay, I have to sit down.

1581
01:31:30,908 --> 01:31:32,677
I'm sorry.

1582
01:31:33,578 --> 01:31:35,881
- That was fun.
- That was good.

1583
01:31:40,685 --> 01:31:42,353
Nurse!
