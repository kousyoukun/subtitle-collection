好
Okay.

4
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,630
这是我们最优秀爸爸的故事
This is the story of our most excellent dads.

5
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:45,100
我是比尔·普雷斯顿
I'm Bill S. Preston, Esquire.

6
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,700
我是Ted 西奥多 洛根
And I'm Ted "Theodore" Logan.

7
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,500
我们是威尔德·斯塔林！
And we're Wyld Stallyns!

8
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,410
这可能是你第一次见到他们了
This was probably the first time you saw 'em.

9
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,340
让我们摇滚吧！
Let's rock!

10
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,380
这可能是最后一次了
And this was probably the last.

11
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,380
就在我们出生之前不久
Not long before we were born,

12
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,130
他们被告知要写一首歌
they were told they were gonna write a song

13
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,390
会团结整个世界
that was gonna unite the entire world.

14
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:09,740
他们认为他们已经做了
Which they thought they had done

15
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,190
用他们的单曲
with their hit single...

16
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,490
那些摇滚的人
Those Who Rock.

17
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,330
它不仅没有团结世界
Not only did it not unite the world,

18
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,370
但乐队分崩离析了
but the band fell apart.

19
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:24,000
而我们的爸爸们 现在一个人 就越来越努力了
And our dads, alone now, were trying harder and harder.

20
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,840
但问题是 爸爸们越努力
But the problem was, the harder Dads tried...

21
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,310
兴趣较不小的人
The less interested

22
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,710
人们似乎在他们的音乐
people seemed to be in their music.

23
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,410
不仅穿在他们身上和家人
Not only was it wearing on them and on the family...

24
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,050
但他们被告知的宇宙
But the universe they were told

25
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,820
他们要聚在一起
they were gonna bring together...

26
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,050
实际上开始瓦解
Was actually starting to unravel.

27
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,220
是的 时间在自己上折叠
Yeah, time was folding in on itself.

28
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,290
太糟了
It was bad.

29
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,390
什么 什么？
What, what?

30
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,560
完全 伙计
Totally, dude.

31

制造一些噪音！
Make some noise!

32
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,100
无论如何 这就是我们现在如何去
Anyways, this is how we got to where we are now.

33

你的妻子不是中世纪的英格兰人

你没有去天堂和地狱

95
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:46,330
因为那是不可能的
Because it's impossible.

96
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,970
这里有一个真正的想法 你们两个
Here's a real idea for you two.

他们24岁 他们住在家里
They're 24, they live at home

103
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,980
他们失业了
and they're unemployed.

104
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,750
你还记得你曾经给他们打电话的时候
You remember when you used to call them.

105
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,050
小比尔 小德 ？
"Little Bill," "Little Ted"?

106
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,780
我们觉得它很可爱 格兰普斯
We thought it was cute, Gramps.

107

108
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,150
是的 嗯 原来是个诅咒

109
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,360
我看到他们做的只是坐在那里听音乐

你家唯一的成年人？

唯一有实际工作的人？
The only ones with actual jobs?

117
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,410
收拾东西吧

118
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,570
-别听他的 -哎呀

I really appreciate you doing this.

120
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,780
我知道那不是你的选择
I know it wasn't your choice.

121
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,280
当然 乔
Of course, Jo.

122
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,970
我真的希望这对我们俩都有效
I really want this to work for both of us.

123
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,420
是的
Yeah.

124
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,050
哦 嘿
Oh, hey.

125
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,490
怎么样 伙计？
How's it goin', dude?

126
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,590
很好 伙计
Good, dude.

127
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,840
-嗨！ -嘿 乔
- Hi! - Hey, Jo.

128
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,120
哦 不 不
Oh, no, no.

129
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,790
对不起 今天对吗？
I'm sorry, is this the right day?

130
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,590
是的 完全
Yeah, totally.

131
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,730
所以 你明白为什么这种情况
So, do you understand why this situation

132
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,170
可能看起来很奇怪 你的妻子？
might seem at all strange to your wives?

133
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,740
不 一点也不 为什么？
No. Not at all. Why?

134
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,440
当你妻子建议夫妻治疗时
Well, when your wives suggested couples therapy,

135
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,480
你认为这就是他们的想法吗？
do you think that this is what they had in mind?

136
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,780
嗯 当然
Well, definitely.

137
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,050
我是说 我们是一对夫妻 对吧？
I mean, we're a couple of couples, right?

138
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,520
-那是真的 -是的
- That is true. - Yeah.

139
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,680
但通常 用夫妻治疗
But usually, with couples therapy,

140
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,950
只意味着一对夫妇
it just means one couple.

141
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,120
这是有道理的
That makes sense.

142
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,620
是的
Yeah.

143
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,240
嗯 但是 你知道 我们在这里
Well, but, you know, we're here,

144

00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,150
问题是 他们是对的 比尔

你的打法和我在开玩笑
Your playing rivaled, and I'm not kidding,

234

你是说
Did you say,

338

339
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,880
是的！
Yes!

他们完全恨我们

一首歌如何拯救现实？
How does a song save reality?

351
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,990
我不能告诉你 但必须告诉你
That I can't tell you, but it has to.

352
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,930
不知怎么的
Somehow.

353
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,300
大转盘正在倾斜
The Great Turntable is tipping.

354
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,500
有空间和时间的中心
That there is the center of space and time.

355
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:33,300
圣迪马斯 700 年前 晚上 7:17
San Dimas 700 years ago, 7:17 p.m.

356
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,610
我父亲相信这首歌
My father believed that the song

357
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,580
可能是关系点 带来

358
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,340
人类进入节奏和和谐
humanity into rhythm and harmony.

359
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,010
如何？
How?

00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,030
我们最近才发现 但是没有它

361
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,750
现实会崩溃
reality will collapse,

362
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,790
时间和空间将不复存在

363
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,720
直到晚上7点17分

一切是可能的

365
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,360
晚上7点17分之后呢？
And after 7:17 p.m.?

366
00:17:55,430 --> 00:18:00,260
没有这首歌 晚上7点17分之后就没有了
Without the song, there is no after 7:17 p.m.

367
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,410
这是我爸爸的他想让你拥有它
This was my dad's. He'd want you to have it.

368
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:13,040
这将有助于跟踪圣迪马斯的时间
It'll help keep track of the time in San Dimas.

369
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,920
有时事情没有意义
"Sometimes things don't make sense..."

370
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:24,790
直到故事结束
"...until the end of the story."

371
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:27,290
我爸爸总是这样说的
That's what my dad always said.

372
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:30,230
我留给你吗？
I'll leave you to it?

373
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,310
好
Okay.

374
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:44,840
现在我们要做的就是
Now alls we gotta do

375
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,910
是写有史以来最伟大的歌曲
is write the greatest song ever written.

376
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:50,680
这带来了整个世界的节奏与和谐
That brings the entire world into rhythm and harmony.

377
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,850
并保存现实 因为我们知道它
And saves reality as we know it.

378
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,820
全部通过
All through...

379
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,020
时间
time.

380
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:01,960
哥们
Dude.

381
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,630
我们一生都在度过
We've spent our whole life

382
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,100
试图写这首歌 将团结世界
trying to write the song that will unite the world.

383
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,170
是什么让我们认为我们可以在75分钟内写出它？
What makes us think we can write it in, like, 75 minutes?

384
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,030
Ted我们得写那首歌
Ted, we had to have written that song.

385
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,440
将来的人告诉我们我们做到了
The people in the future told us we did.

386
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,370
是的 我想
Yeah. I guess.

387
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,510
就是说我们身上有它 伙计
Which means we have it in us, dude.

388
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,910
也许我们还没写呢
Maybe we just haven't written it yet.

389
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,410
也许我们还是会去的
Maybe we're still gonna.

390
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,150
好吧 如果我们还没有写出来
Well, if we haven't written it yet,

391
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,620
但我们知道我们会在某个时候
but we know we're gonna at some point,

392
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,820
为什么我们不能去未来
why can't we just go to the future

393
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,990
我们什么时候写的？
when we have written it?

394
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,220
从自己身上拿走！
And take it from ourselves!

395
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:34,960
是的！
Yeah!

396
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,890
泰德！你有过很多
Ted! You have had many

397
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,060
多年来的反直觉想法
counterintuitive ideas over the years,

398
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,530
但这是到目前为止
but this is by far

399
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,270
他们当中的反直觉 伙计！
the counterintuitivest of them all, dude!

400
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,870
除了 这不是偷窃吗？
Except, won't that be stealing?

401
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,340
偷东西怎么样？
How is that stealing

402
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:54,810
如果我们从自己那里偷来的 伙计？
if we're stealing it from ourselves, dude?

403
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,820
-是的 -是的
- Yeah. - Yeah.

404
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,190
我希望它仍然有效
I hope it still works.

405
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,590
是的
Yeah.

406
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,460
你认为我们到我们的未来有多远？
How far into our future do you think we gotta go?

407
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:11,090
这取决于我们什么时候写的那首歌
It depends on when we think we wrote that song.

408
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,260
让我们保守一点 说 两年？
Let's be conservative. Say, two years?

409
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,530
听起来不错Ted
Sounds good, Ted.

410
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,970
然后 一旦我们得到这首歌
Then, once we get the song,

411
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,140
在离开之前 我们会回到家
we'll go back home to right before we left.

412
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,370
然后呢？
And then what?

413
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,040
团结世界 拯救现实 伙计
Unite the world and save reality, dude.

414
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,280
-比尔 我的朋友 -是的Ted我的朋友？
- Bill, my friend. - Yes, Ted, my friend?

415
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:34,550
我有一种感觉 事情即将改变
I have a feeling things are about to change

416
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,950
以最出色的方式
in a most outstanding way.

417
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,190
我完全同意
I could not agree more.

418
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,710
你没事吧 伙计？
You okay, dude?

419

00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,700
我们去向自己问好 唱那首歌吧
Let's go say hello to ourselves and get that song.

422
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,690
这是一个生锈的桶 伙计
It's a rusty bucket, dude.

423
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,520
给那些摇滚的人
To those who rock.

424
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,890
在这里 伙计
Over here, dude.

他们说我们在谈论这个谈话
They say we're talking the talk.

426
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,560
但我们在散步
But we're walking the walk.

427
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:18,560
等 我们在玩那些摇滚的人？
Wait. We're playing Those Who Rock?

428
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:19,730
这里？

429
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,900

00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,100
大家！
Everybody!

432
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,570
我们是那些摇滚的人
We are those who rock.

433
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,670
现在拍你的手！

435
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,210
是啊 摇滚！
Yeah, rock!

436
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,410
哦 伙计 那是我们！
Oh, dude, that's us!

437
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,890
别看 他们看不到我们 伙计！
Don't look and they won't see us, dude!

438
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:43,320
比尔 等等！
Bill, wait!

439
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:46,120
走 走 走！
Go, go, go!

440
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:48,930
-快到货车上了！ -嘿 我们 停下！
- Almost at the van! - Hey, us's, stop!

441
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,130
哦 你好！
Oh, hello!

442
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,900
我们完全忘了你要来
We totally forgot you were coming.

443
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:57,700
-是的 -见到你多好
- Yeah. - How great to see you.

444
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:01,800
你在谈论什么？你完全离开了我们
What are you talking about? You totally ran away from us.

445
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,440
听着 伙计们 我们很清楚你们在想什么
Look, guys, we know exactly what you're thinking.

446
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:07,010
我们为什么要在晚上6:15玩开放麦克风之夜
Why would we be playing Open Mic Night at 6:15 p.m.

447
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,880
事实上 我们又成了如此巨大的摇滚明星
when, in fact, we have become such huge rock stars again.

448
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,180
是的
Yeah.

449
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,370
答案是:答案
Here's the answer.

450
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,820
-是的 -我们在这里
- Yeah. - Us being here

451
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,850
是幽默的讽刺
is humorously ironic.

452
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,690
你相信我们吗？
Do you believe us?

453
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,590
不
No.

454
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,930
一点也不
Not at all.

455
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:24,330
那么 我为你感到难过
Well, I feel sorry for you, then.

456
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,530
伙计 我想我们来得太早了
Dude, I think we came too early.

457
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,830
这些其他人我们没有这首歌
These other us's don't have the song.

458
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,290
你为什么不自己去写呢？
Why don't you go write it yourselves

459
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,540
而不是想从我们那里偷？
instead of trying to steal it from us?

460
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,640
你就是不会写字的人Ted
You're the one who couldn't write it, Ted.

461
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:44,010
你失去了他的妻子Ted
Well, you're the one who lost his wife, Ted.

462
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,780
什么？
What?

463
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:47,220
你在谈论什么？
What are you talking about?

464
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,320
事情是在这里 比尔
Here's what happened, Bill.

465
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,260
在你们失败的夫妻治疗之后
After you failed couples therapy,

466
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,230
丽兹和乔被其他他们从未来访问
Liz and Jo were visited by other thems from the future

467
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,630
谁给了他们一个电话亭
who gave them a phone booth

468
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:58,760
并发送他们所有通过时间和空间
and sent them all through time and space

469
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,330
只寻找一个生命
looking for just one life

470
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,000
在那里他们可以很高兴你！
where they could be happy with you!

471
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,400
你猜怎么着？
And guess what?

472
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,440
他们没找到！
They didn't find one!

473
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,470
现在我们独处了两年
And now we've been alone for two years

474
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,470
因为你把妻子送走了
'cause you sent our wives away.

475
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,940
不可能
No way.

476
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,510
是的 是的！
Yes way!

477
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,550
我们的妻子已经走了两年了
Our wives have been gone for two years

478
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:17,780
而你什么也没做？
and you didn't do anything about it?

479
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,250
哦 你做到了 好吧
Oh, you did, all right.

480
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,480
你回去了 你让事情变得更糟了！
You went back and you made it worse!

481
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,220
猜猜还有什么？
And guess what else?

482
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:25,490
你的女儿甚至不会和你说话
Your daughters won't even talk to you.

483
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,560
什么？
What?

484
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,630
你是个白痴Ted
You're a dick, Ted.

485
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:31,390
-你要分一块我Ted？ -Ted他不值得！
- You want a piece of me, Ted? - Ted, he's not worth it!

486
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,000
嘿！他不值得我们得走了
Hey! He's not worth it, dude. We gotta go.

487
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:37,600
是的！拯救我们的婚姻
Yeah! And save our marriages.

488
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:39,340
失败者！已经！
Losers! Has-beens!

489
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,190
-不管怎样！ -别和自己打架了！
- Whatever! - Stop fighting with yourself!

490
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,640
在锅里闪烁！
Flashes in the pans!

491
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,230
别和自己打架了！
Stop fighting with yourself!

492
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,450
这一点并不顺利
That did not go well.

493
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:52,780
是的 而你的你是一个非常有争议的鸡巴杂草
Yeah. And your you is a very contentious dickweed.

494
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:55,650
比尔 我们得回去和莉兹和乔谈谈
Bill, we gotta go back and talk with Liz and Jo.

495
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,290
在它 伙计
On it, dude.

496
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,130
请 妈妈 爸爸说普雷斯顿/洛根
Please, Mother, Dad said Preston/Logan

497
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,300
乐队里每个人都会团结起来
and everyone in the band will unite...

498
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:13,040
我记得他说的每个字
I remember what he said. Every word.

499
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,710
那就给他们一个机会
Well, then, give them a chance.

500
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,110
我给了他们一个机会
I gave them a chance

501
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,840
以及他们可能需要的一切
and everything they could possibly need,

502
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,680
但他们螺栓
but they bolted.

503
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,310
凯利
Kelly,

504
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,230
你知道你父亲和我同意了一切
you know your father and I agreed on everything,

505
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,180
但还有其他解释
but there are other interpretations

506
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,150
他采取行动的信息
of the information he was acting on.

507
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,750
我知道
I'm aware of that.

508
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,390
许多议员认为 事实上
Many on the council believe that it is, in fact,

509
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,220
比尔和Ted的死
the death of Bill and Ted

510
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:36,760
这将带来新的时代

511
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:39,930
嗯 我完全不同意！
Well, I disagree with that completely!

512
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,560
太残暴了！
That's atrocious!

513
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:44,430
也许有一天当你是伟大的领袖
Well, maybe someday when you're the Great Leader,

514
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,970
你可以做决定
you can make the decisions

515
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,200
会影响所有的时间和空间
that will affect all time and space.

516
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,970
你可以说 领袖
You could just say "Leader."

517
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,580
-太自命不凡了 -准备好了吗？
- So pretentious. - Is it ready?

518
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,750
是的 伟大的领袖 应该是的
Yes, Great Leader. It should be.

519
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:56,830
应该是 ？
"Should be"?

520
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,050
是
Is.

521
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,950
夫人
Madam.

522
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,250
你知道我是谁吗？
Do you know who I am?

523
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:06,290
是的 伟大的领袖
Yes, Great Leader.

524
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,800
你知道该怎么做
You know what to do.

525
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:17,170
你不能失败
You must not fail.

526
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:18,740
必须
Must...

527
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,040
不
not...

528
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,710
失败
fail.

529
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:31,450
我不敢相信你会杀了比尔和Ted！
I cannot believe you're gonna kill Bill and Ted!

530
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,220
爸爸会生你的气的
Dad would be so mad at you.

531
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,050
我们别无选择 凯尔
We're out of options, Kel.

532
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,690
解开已经开始了
The unravelling has already begun.

533
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,840
未来的家伙！你回来了？
Future dude! You're back?

534
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:59,840
我在找你父亲他们来过这里吗？
I'm looking for your fathers. Have they been here?

535
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:02,280
不
No.

536
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:10,390
我们的爸爸呢？
Where are our dads?

537
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:11,870
他们正在磨难中 不是吗？
They're in a tribulation, aren't they?

538
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,360
是的
They are.

539
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,480
听着 你没看见一个看起来吓人的机器人
Listen, you didn't see a scary-looking robot

540
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,730
从未来 是吗？
from the future, did you?

541
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,090
哦 什么？不
Oh, what? No.

542
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,300
我妈妈对每件事都反应过度
My mom, who overreacts about everything

543
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,470
-刚发了一个 -去找我们的爸爸？
- just sent one. - To get our dads?

544
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:23,530
不用担心 我不会让这种事发生
Don't worry. I won't let that happen.

545
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,400
我们也在努力帮助他们
Well, we're trying to help 'em, too.

546
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,340
嘿
Hey.

547
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:31,210
嘿 这个可以去 就像
Hey, this can go, like...

548
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,380
比如 任何地方 对吧？就像 所有的时间？
like, anywhere, right? Like, all throughout time?

549
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:37,350
没错 但我需要留下来
That's correct, but I need to stay.

550
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,350
我猜是我妈妈的使者
My guess is that my mom's emissary

551
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,750
会在这里找他们
will be looking for them here.

552
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,420
嗯
Well,

553
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:43,810
我和莎打算帮爸爸们听音乐
Thea and I were gonna help our dads with their music

554
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,290
通过把它们整理样本
by putting together samples for 'em.

555
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,720
是的 但现在它出现
Yeah, but now it appears

556
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,560
我们可以拼凑一个真正的乐队
we could put together an actual band.

557
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,910
我是说 只有他们 他们独自一人！
I mean, it's just them, and they're all alone!

558
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,590
嘿 你介意吗？
Hey, so, do you mind

559
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,250
当你呆在这儿等那个看起来可怕的机器人时
while you stay here and wait for the scary-looking robot,

560
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,780
你能告诉我们如何使用展位吗？
you could show us how to use the booth?

561
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,940
伙计 我们得记住
Dude, we gotta remember.

562
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,370
让它变得更好 而不是更糟！
Make it better, not worse!

563
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,710
是的 我希望他们还在那里
Yeah. I hope they're still there.

564
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:06,740
只是他们被给予的工作
It's just that the job that they've been given, it is...

565
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,540
-不可能 - 不可能
- Impossible. - ...impossible.

566
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:10,280
乔安娜！
Joanna!

567
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,470
-伊丽莎白！ -嗨！
- Elizabeth! - Hi!

568
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,850
我们需要和你谈谈
We need to talk to you.

569
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,280
哦 我们回来了
Oh, and we're back.

570
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,890
这超级重要 伍德博士
This is super important, Dr. Wood.

571
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:18,390
我们刚看到自己两年后
We just saw ourselves two years in the future.

572
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,810
等等 你又在时间旅行了？
Wait, you're time-travelling again?

573
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,730
只有拯救现实 因为我们知道
Only to save reality as we know it.

574
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,130
好 也许
Okay. Maybe...

575
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,750
但是我们发现了更糟糕的事情
But we just found out something way worse.

576
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,260

580
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,370

'Cause we seriously appear

581
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,840
住在我们的货车里
to be living in our van.

582
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:38,340
哦 伙计 我们完全住在那辆货车里
Oh, dude, we are totally living in that van.

583
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:40,010
我喝得太多了
And I'm drinking way too much.

584
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,280
亲爱的 你甚至不喝酒

但我要 好多
But I'm going to. A lot.

587
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:45,780
-什么？ -是的还有谎言
- What? - Yeah. And the lying.

588
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:47,920
你不能相信我们是什么骗子
You cannot believe what liars we are.

589
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,920
是啊 绝望 可怜 撒谎的失败者
Yeah, desperate, pathetic, lying losers.

590
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,560

好吧 我们停下来一会儿
Okay, let's stop for a moment

592
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,490

and take notice of the dynamic.

593
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,300

公主
Princesses.

595
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,730
确定 这是一个词
Sure. That's a word.

596
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,430
不 我们其实是公主
No, we actually are princesses.

597
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,700
我们出生于1410年 1408
We were born in 1410. 1408.

598
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:08,940
好 我们离开你呢？
Okay. What about us leaving you?

599
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:10,110

是的 来证明我们不是
Yeah. To prove that we're not

602
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,980
我们刚才看到的失败者
the losers we just saw we were.

603
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,350
即使那些失败者 我们试图告诉我们
Even though those loser us's tried to tell us

604
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,920
不要来和你说话
not to come and talk to you.

605
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,120
是的 就像我们会让事情变得更糟一样
Yeah. Like we were somehow gonna make it worse.

606
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,720
但我们并没有让事情变得更糟 对吧？
But we're not making it worse, right?

607
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:27,660

太可怕了 伙计
That went terrible, dude.

625
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,500
两年前进显然是不够的
Two years forward was clearly not enough.

626
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,200
这次我们试试五个吧
Let's try five this time.

我有点紧张
I'm a little bit nervous

636
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,220
说实话 时间旅行
to time-travel again, to be honest.

637
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,280
我也是我们没有时间旅行
As am I. We haven't time-traveled

二十多年来

最可置疑的
Most indubitably.

648
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,110
你确定是这个吗？
You sure this is it?

649
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:58,010
对不起 吉米·亨德里克斯先生？
Uh, excuse me, Mr. Jimi Hendrix?

Yeah. We're here for our dads to help them unite the world.

Like, no exaggeration, literally unite the world.

657
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,930
通过给他们准备一个杀手乐队
By putting together a killer band for 'em,

658
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,700
我们必须从你开始

But how are we gonna get him to be in a band

665

666
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,390
好吧 好吧

Well, I want to be in that number.

672
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,900
哦 当圣徒们游行进去的时候
Oh, when the saints go marching in.

673
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:33,840
好吧 好吧 好吧好吧
All right, all right, all right. All right.

00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,390
所以 这是惊人的恩典
So, that is Amazing Grace

680
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,790
由吉米亨德里克斯先生发挥
played by a Mr. Jimi Hendrix.

681
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,760
谁在乐队里
Who's in the band.

682
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,550
并特别要求你的存在 所以
And specifically requested your presence, so...

683
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,200
原因就在这里
And here's why.

684
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,860
你的即兴表演 显然受到了影响
Your improvisations, obviously influenced

685
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,240
邦克·约翰逊和奥利弗国王
by Bunk Johnson and King Oliver...

686
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,070
是的 但最终是独一无二的
Yeah, but ultimately sui generis.

687
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,140
完全启发了他 先生
...totally inspired him, sir.

688
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,810
你得来看看这个 伙计们
You gotta come see this, fellas.

689
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:12,170
你拿到什么了 卢？

一首歌都唱了这些？
One song did all this?

696
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:36,270
Ted如果不只是一首歌呢？
Ted, what if it wasn't just one song?

697
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:38,970
如果我们写了它拯救了宇宙
What if after we wrote it and saved the universe,

698
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:42,070
大坝破了 歌曲只是保持科明和科明？
a dam broke and the songs just kept comin' and comin'?

699
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,140

705
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,360
三年前
from three years ago...

706
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,990
我们现在终于能够
We are now finally able

707
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,530
为他们要一些同情
to muster some compassion for them.

708
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,830
我们确实有
...we actually do have...

709
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,730
货物

你的未来
To your futures.

711
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:19,180
-我们做到了 伙计 -是的！
- We did it, dude. - Yeah!

712
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,150
干杯！
Cheers!

713
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,820
那么 你们为什么都有英国口音？
So, uh, why do you both have English accents?

714
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:32,460
啊 有趣的故事请
Ah. Funny story. Please.

715
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,160
一旦比尔和我被封为骑士
Once Bill and I were knighted,

716
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:40,160
丽兹和乔一起一切都很好
things got so good with Liz and Jo

717
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:42,170
我们决定 作为家庭
that we decided, as families,

718
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:46,400
开始在中世纪的英格兰夏天
to start summering in medieval England.

719
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:50,140
我想它只是血腥好擦掉！
And I suppose it just bloody well rubbed off!

720
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:54,640
我不能说我们是多么的我们将在这件事上大为抱怨
And I can't say how chuffed we are about it.

721
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:58,180
真是一种解脱！
That is such a relief!

722
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,750
我必须说
I must say,

723
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,390
虽然我不喜欢以前的我们
as much as I disliked those previous us's,

724
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,760
我喜欢这些我们
I like these us's.

725
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,080
是的 我没有大问题
Yeah. I didn't have a big problem

726
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,460
和其他我一起
with that other me,

727
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:12,160
但我确实更喜欢这个
but I do like this other me even more.

728
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,500
是的
Yeah.

729
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:16,630
说够了 伙计
Enough talking, mates.

730
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,000
准备好了吗
Are you ready...

731
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:20,040
一切
...for everything...

732
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,440
改变？
...to change?

733
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,420
哇
Whoa.

734
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,460
那真是
That is truly...

735
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:51,940
最美妙的歌
the most amazing song...

736
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,800
我听过
I have ever heard.

737
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:57,170
很棒
It's great.

738
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,810
老实说 我就不会想到我们身上有它
Honestly, I wouldn't have thought we had it in us.

739
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,080
啊
Ah.

740
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,010
但你有！
But you do!

741
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,220
现在是
And now it's time...

742
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:10,420
把它拿到世界
to get it out to the world.

743
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,160
是的！
Yeah!

744
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,960
我永远不会忘记你 比尔爵士
I'll never forget you, Sir Bill.

745
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:23,400
马上回到你后面 比利·博约
Right back at you, Billie boyo.

746
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,870
这么久了 我猜
So long, I guess.

747
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,310
谢谢！
And thanks!

748
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:30,510

749
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:31,970
再见
So long.

750
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,110
塔利霍！
Tallyho!

751
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,780
奇妙！
Marvelous!

752
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:41,070
Ted你为什么对自己表现得这么奇怪 伙计？
Ted, why were you acting so weird with yourself, dude?

753
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,320
我不知道 我似乎总是对自己表现得很奇怪
I don't know. I always seem to act weird with myself.

754
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:45,960
是的 你会的！你得克服它 伙计
Yeah, you do! You gotta get over that, dude.

755
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,090
我们拿到歌了！
We got the song!

756
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:51,730
戴夫· 格罗尔！
Dave Grohl!

757
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,630
你们是谁？
Who are you guys?

758
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,270
你在我家干什么？
What're you doin' in my house?

759
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:57,770
哦不
Oh, no.

760
00:36:57,830 --> 00:37:00,040
不 不 不
No, no, no.

761
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,050
现在 我们将等待其他我们
Now we'll wait for those other us's

762
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:14,080
回去改变一切
to go back and change everything.

763
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:17,220
我们的生活好多了
To our lives getting a whole lot better.

764
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:18,620
是的
Yeah.

765
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:24,360
Ted说真的 慢点喝伏特加 伙计
Ted, seriously, slow down on the vodka, dude.

766
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:28,060
你们完全骗了我们！
You guys totally lied to us!

767
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:30,830
你为什么不把这首歌带回圣迪马斯？
Why haven't you taken the song back to San Dimas?

768
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,240
也许因为这不是我们的歌！
Maybe 'cause it's not our song!

769
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,800
罂粟花！
Poppycock!

770
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:36,270
是戴夫·格罗尔的！
It's Dave Grohl's!

771
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:39,480
他现在在外面叫警察
And he's outside right now calling the cops.

772
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,180
Ted我告诉过你
Ted, I told you

773
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:43,650
戴夫·格罗尔本周回来了
Dave Grohl came back this week.

774
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,310
完全以为他下周回来
Totally thought he came back next week.

775
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,480
你们到底在想什么？
What were you guys even thinking?

776
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:49,850
只是因为你们两个不能想出一首很棒的歌
Just 'cause you two couldn't come up with a great song...

777
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,390
戴夫·格罗尔做到了！
And Dave Grohl did!

778
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:53,520
并不意味着我们应该为此受到惩罚
...doesn't mean we should be punished for that.

779
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,260
我们不会这么做的
We're not gonna do it.

780
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,060
你必须去！
You have to!

781
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:01,100
这是你让我们的妻子回来的唯一机会
It's your only chance to get our wives back.

782
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,930
你在撒谎？
You were lying about that?

783
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,900
我们当然在撒谎
Of course we were lying.

784
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:06,540
哦 天啊
Oh, man.

785
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,400
是的 他们不想和你有关系！
Yeah, they don't want anything to do with you!

786
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,040
因为他们穿越了所有的时间
'Cause they traveled all through time

787
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:12,040
终于意识到你是失败者
and finally realized you are losers.

788
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:15,010
是的 因为你做出了错误的选择！
Yeah, 'cause you make bad choices!

789
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,550
喜欢这个！
Like this!

790
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,350
现在 把这首歌！
Now, take the song!

791
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,880
伙计们 说真的
Guys, seriously,

792
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:23,020
你不必用枪指着我们
you don't have to pull guns on us.

793
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:25,790
是的？看当我们不这样的时候会发生什么
Yeah? Watch what happens when we don't.

794
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,120
看到？
See?

795
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,960
我不得不承认 比尔 你是对的
I have to admit, Bill. You were right.

796
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,200
泰德！
Ted!

797
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:35,330
-你必须这么做 -是的！
- You have to do it. - Yeah!

798
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,870
-我们的生活是地狱！ -是的！
- Our life is hell! - Yeah!

799
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:37,950
如果你不回去改变它
And if you don't go back and change it...

800
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:39,270
改变它！
Change it!

801
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:55,290
现在结束 谎言 妄想
This ends now. The lies, the delusions.

802
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:57,450
我受够了我受够了他们两个
I'm done with him. I'm done with both of them.

803
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,050
你不会杀戴德的 爸爸
You're not gonna kill Ted, Dad.

804
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,590
他闯进了戴夫·格罗尔的家！
He broke into Dave Grohl's house!

805
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,960
爸爸 慢点
Dad, slow down.

806
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:04,590
我们还没有全部的故事
We don't have the whole story yet.

807
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:09,830
无法摆脱我们 比尔和Ted
Can't get away from us, Bill and Ted.

808
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,300
Ted他们是对的他们是我们
Ted, they're right. They're us.

809
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:13,370
他们记得我们要做的一切！
They remember everything we're gonna do!

810
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,040
那意味着我们得做点什么
That means we gotta do something

811
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:17,440
我们不可能记得
we can't possibly remember.

812
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:19,980
射杀他们
Shoot 'em.

813
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:25,250
哦不 他们会做那件事
Oh, no. They're gonna do the thing.

814
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,680
我希望
I was hoping

815
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,890
他们这次不记得了
they wouldn't remember that this time.

816
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:33,360
没有人离开大楼
No one leaves the building.

817
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,270
伙计 我们该怎么办？
Dude, what do we do?

818
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,310
不知道 这就是重点！
No idea, that's the point!

819
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:51,610
我很困惑！
I'm confused!

820
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,180
我也是！
Me, too!

821
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:00,850
Ted那完全成功了！
Ted, that totally worked!

822
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,620
是的 也许我们总是不知道我们在做什么
Yeah. Maybe we should always not know what we're doing.

823
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:05,220
时间？
Time?

824
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,420
四十七分钟
Forty-seven minutes.

825
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:09,310
好吧 我们得继续走未来
All right, we gotta keep going further into the future.

826
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,460
在某个时候 我们一定是写了那首歌
At some point, we must've written that song.

827
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:13,660
-五年后试试 -好的
- Try in five years. - Okay.

828
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,670
哥们
Dude.

829
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,900
什么？
What's that?

830
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:22,670
我不知道
I don't know.

831
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:25,840
但最令人震惊的是
But it's most alarming.

832
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,380
-比尔？ -我试着 伙计
- Bill? - I'm tryin', dude.

833
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,610
-比尔？ -快到了 伙计
- Bill? - Almost there, dude.

834
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,310
条例 草案！

835
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,150
知道了！
I got it!

836
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:57,370
加油！你又来了？我说了不
Come on! You again? I said no.

837
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,710
给我们但我敢打赌你不能对这个人说不
To us. But I bet you can't say no to this man.

838
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:02,480
吉米·亨德里克斯先生 见见路易斯·阿姆斯特朗先生
Mr. Jimi Hendrix, meet Mr. Louis Armstrong.

839
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:06,680
你玩的舔是猫的叫声 伙计
That lick you played was the cat's meow, man.

840
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:08,450
是蓝调 但也
It's blues, but also...

841
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,720
你用什么词 年轻女士？
What's the word you used, young ladies?

842
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:13,520
-精神病 -精神病
- Psychedelic. - Psychedelic.

843
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:15,420

Exactly.

844
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:17,490
很有趣 不管你是谁
Very funny, whoever you are.

845

Louis Armstrong's, like, 65 years old.

846
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,260
哥们 伙计 我告诉过你
Dude, dude, I told you

847
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:23,700
我们应该变老的路易斯
we should've gotten older Louis.

848
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:25,840
这也是你的主意！
It was your idea, too!

849
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:30,810
嗯 年轻的女士们在1922年接我 吉姆
Well, the young ladies picked me up in 1922, Jim.

850
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:33,180
这支持我们放在一起
Which supports both that we're putting together

851
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,010
一个最非凡的乐队
a most extraordinary band...

852
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,750
是的 我们这样做
Yeah. And that we are doing so

853
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:38,780
通过旅行所有的时间
by traveling all throughout time.

854
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:41,180
来 让我休息一下
Come on, give me a break.

855
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,500
他挖了那个吉夫 嘿？
He dug that jive, hey?

856
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:57,230
土豆头蓝调？
Potato Head Blues?

857
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,630
那是什么标题？
What kind of title is that?

858
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,200
一个明确的 阿姆斯特朗先生
A definitive one, Mr. Armstrong.

859
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:02,890
你们都说的
So, what you're all saying

860
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:07,040
你喜欢我将来写的歌吗？
is that you love a song that I wrote in my future?

861
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,340
那是你的过去
Which is in your past.

862
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:11,280
但是 我们都在这里的现在
But we're all here in this present.

863
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:15,180
哪些是过去？
Which is actually the past?

864
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:16,850
没错 先生们
Exactly, gentlemen.

865
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,890
迷人
Fascinating.

866
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,870
莫扎特先生现在我们在谈
Herr Mozart. Now we're talkin'.

867
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,460
是的！嘿 沃尔夫
Yeah! Hey, Wolfie.

868
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:08,260
吉 米
Jimi.

869
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:16,740
伙计 未来完全派了一个杀手机器人来追捕我们
Dude, the future totally sent a killer robot after us.

870
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:19,740
这就是为什么我们要找到这首歌 伙计
That's why we gotta find the song, dude.

871
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,880
无望
Hopeless,

872
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:29,380
无奈垂死的呼吸
helpless dying breath.

873
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:32,550
无望 无奈垂死的气息
Hopeless, helpless dying breath.

874
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:35,390
这不可能是这首歌 伙计
This can't possibly be the song, dude.

875
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,910
-疼痛！ -疼痛！
- Pain! - Pain!

876
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:38,450
-死亡！ -死亡！
- Death! - Death!

877
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:41,160
欢迎来到
Welcome to...

878
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:42,900
结束！
...the end!

879
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,100
不可能！
No way!

880
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:49,870
-够了！停止！ -够了！停止！
- Enough! Stop! - Enough! Stop!

881
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:53,310
挺身而出
Come forward.

882
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:56,180
怎么样 比尔和Ted？
How's it goin', Bill and Ted?

883
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:57,480
你觉得我们的歌怎么样？
How'd you like our song?

884
00:44:57,550 --> 00:45:00,250
-那是首歌吗？ -是的！
- Is that a song? - Yes!

885
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,980
有点黑暗
It's a little on the dark side,

886
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:04,690
但是 你知道 这很酷
but, you know, that's cool.

887
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:06,120
你们为什么在监狱里？
Why are you guys in prison?

888
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:08,390
也许是因为你们离开了我们
Oh, maybe because you guys left us

889
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,560
以五年前的秋天
to take the fall five years ago.

890
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:12,730
啊 真有意思 因为对我们来说
Ah. That's funny, 'cause for us

891
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,530
只是五分钟前
it's only, like, five minutes ago.

892
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:17,030
-嗯？ -那么 我们现在就走
- Huh? - So, we'll be leaving now.

893
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,370
你哪儿也不去 漂亮孩子
You're not goin' anywhere, pretty boy.

894
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,690
我们已经等了很多年了
We've been waiting for years

895
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,210
使事情正确
to make things right.

896
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:23,870
但一切都会有所不同
But everything's gonna be different.

897
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:28,110
因为不像那些最后的我们 我们实际上有一首歌
'Cause unlike those last us's, we actually have a song.

898
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,180
是首歌吗？
Is it a song?

899
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:30,850
是的！
Yes!

900
00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:34,520
比尔Ted说真的 我们不能把那首歌拿回来
Bill, Ted, seriously, we can't take that song back.

901
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:37,390
哦 你不会收回的 柯莉
Oh, you're not taking it back, Curly.

902
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:38,820
我们要把它拿回来！
We're taking it back!

903
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:40,620
你会留在这里腐烂
You're gonna stay here and rot

904
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:43,260
我们要去恢复生命和我们的妻子！
and we're gonna go get lives and our wives back!

905
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:44,390
团结世界！
And unite the world!

906
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:45,660
拯救现实！
And save reality!

907
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:47,830
-你是？ -是的！
- You are? - Yes!

908
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,600
冻结 普雷斯顿/洛根
Freeze, Preston/Logan.

909
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:56,640
你知道如果他杀了他们会发生什么
You know what happens if he kills them, dude.

910
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:58,870
他杀了我们
He kills us, dude.

911
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:02,310
坚持！
Hold on!

912
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:04,450
你想要一些比尔和Ted吗 朋克？
You want some Bill and Ted, punk?

913
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:07,380
抓住他！
Get him!

914
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:14,060
那不是一首歌
That was not a song.

915
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,360
嗯？
Hmm?

916
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:18,390
你是个白痴！
You're being a rotten idiot!

917
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:19,800
太可怕了
That was horrible, dude.

918
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,360
那是我们最糟糕的 伙计！
Those are the worst us's yet, dude!

919
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:22,480
是的 不过 他们确实救了我们
Yeah. They did save us, though.

920
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,500
是的
Yeah.

921
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:25,130
哦不！
Oh, no!

922
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,800
-乔！ -莉兹！
- Jo! - Liz!

923
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:28,490
-哦 嗨！ -怎么样？
- Oh, hi! - How's it goin'?

924
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:31,670
-很好 -天啊 是我吗？
- Good. - Oh, my God, is that you?

925
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,330
-不 不 不！ -我们爱你们
- No, no, no! - We love you guys.

926
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:35,900
-你得走了 -你也许应该走了
- You've gotta go. - You should probably go.

927
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:37,550
-好的 -好的
- All right. - Okay.

928
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:38,870
-我们要修好它！ -我知道了
- We're gonna fix it! - I got it.

929
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,120
哦 上帝啊哦 天哪
Oh, good Lord. Oh, good heavens.

930
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,490
哥们 现在怎么办？
Dude, what now?

931
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:46,920
手表有时说
The watch says sometimes things

932
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:48,760
直到故事结束才有意义
don't make sense till the end of the story.

933
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,330
所以？
So?

934
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,700
也许我们得一直走到底 发现Ted
Maybe we gotta go all the way to the end to find out, Ted.

935
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:56,400
最 非胜利
Most... non-triumphant.

936
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:57,900
振作起来
Pull yourself together.

937
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:00,000
你是个机器人！
You're a robot!

938
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:02,540
到他们接下来要去哪里 然后等待
Get to where they're going next and wait.

939
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:05,880
我们没时间了
We are running out of time.

940
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,720
凌伦的神话原来是真的 T
The myth of Ling Lun turns out to be true, T.

941
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:21,220
我知道 她就是这样的
I know. And she's a she.

942
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:44,250
哦
Oh.

943
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,320
嘿 你想参加我们的乐队吗？

944

-是的 -哦
- Yeah. - Oh.

945
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:06,470
格罗姆 你会爱她的
Grom. You're gonna love her.

946
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:10,010
凌伦说她是有史以来最伟大的鼓手
Ling Lun says she's the greatest drummer of all time.

947
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:15,080
什么？
What?

948
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:30,990
你好 不好意思 你好 小姐 格罗姆小姐
Hello. Excuse me. Hi. Miss... Miss Grom...

949
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:38,930
嗯 我也在努力拯救世界 妈妈
Well, I'm trying to save the world, too, Mother.

950
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,800
不像你们这一代人做得那么好
It's not like your generation's done that great.

951
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:46,240
如果你想知道的话 这里越来越糟了
It's getting worse and worse here, if you were wondering.

952
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,210
啊 撒哈拉沙漠
Ah. Well, the Sahara Desert

953
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,010
刚出现在圣迪马斯 妈妈
just showed up in San Dimas, Mother.

954
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,120
伊丽莎白女王
Queen Elizabeth

955
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,980
正在看它的权利
is looking right at it.

956
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:58,920
不 不 我不会告诉你我在哪里
No. No, I'm not gonna tell you where I am.

957
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:00,760
因为我怎么知道你不会发送
Because how do I know you won't send

958
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:03,690
妈妈 你的杀手机器人跟着我？
your killer robot after me, Mom?

959
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:08,200
我得走了 妈妈
I gotta go, Mom.

960
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,470
这太糟糕了这真的发生了
This is bad. This is really happening.

961
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:16,170
发生了什么事情？
What's happening?

962
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:20,180
哇！孩子库迪！
Whoa! Kid Cudi!

963
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,080
嘿 怎么样 伙计？
Hey, how's it goin', dude?

964
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,710
有人能告诉我到底发生了什么吗？
Can someone please tell me what the hell is happening?

965
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:27,020
基本上 所有的时间和空间都即将结束
Basically, all time and space are about to end

966
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:30,490
除非他们的爸爸晚上7点17分能唱一首歌
unless their dads come up with a song by 7:17 p.m.

967
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,490
-等等什么？ -等等什么？
- Wait. What? - Wait. What?

968
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:34,220
我们以为这是关于音乐的
We thought this was about the music.

969
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:37,030
是的 这也是关于空间和时间的结束
It is. It's also about the end of space and time.

970
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:39,560
伙计 这比我们想象的要糟糕得多
Dude, this is way worse than we thought.

971
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:43,270
那么 这是我们全息双场的某种错误？
So, this is some kind of error in our holographic dual field?

972
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:44,570
还是威尔逊循环
Or is it a Wilsonian loop

973
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:46,230
造成时间奇点？
causing a temporal singularity?

974
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:47,670
嗯 在我看来 你的
Well, seems to me your

975
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:49,270
经典绷紧因果电路
classical tautological causal circuit.

976
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:51,420
我不知道 好像是教科书的纠缠
I don't know. Seems like textbook entanglement to me.

977
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:52,870
我必须说 你的理解
I must say, your understanding

978
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:54,810
我们可怕的情况是最令人印象深刻的
of our dire circumstance is most impressive.

979
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,000
你应该好好利用它 帮助我们拯救现实！
You should put it to good use and help us save reality!

980
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:58,410
是的！
Yeah!

981
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,000
真棒 因为它是空间和时间的结束
That's great. 'Cause it is the end of space and time.

982
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:01,350
右
Right.

983
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:03,920
阿姆斯特朗先生 亨德里克斯先生 莫扎特先生
Mr. Armstrong, Mr. Hendrix, Herr Mozart,

984
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:06,720
格罗姆小姐 凌伦小姐和库迪先生
Miss Grom, Miss Ling Lun, and Mr. Cudi,

985
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:08,240
我们要带你到我们爸爸的工作室
we're gonna take you into our dads' studio

986
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:09,590
并开始练习
and start practicing.

987
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:11,060
所以当我们的爸爸回到这里
So that when our dads get back here

988
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:12,480
用那首将团结世界的歌
with the song that will unite the world,

989
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:13,430
你们可以给他们玩
you guys can play it for 'em.

990
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,060

1272
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:48,640
谁不应该回去
who should not have gone back up.

1273
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:50,740
所以 如果这就是为什么你在这里
So, if that is why you're here...

1274
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:54,080
对不起 不抱歉
Sorry, not sorry.

1275
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:56,250
再见！
Bye!

1276
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,650
-现在怎么办？ -我不知道
- What now? - I don't know, dude.

1277
01:04:59,710 --> 01:05:01,820
爸爸们 我们有个主意
Dads, we have an idea.

1278
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:03,550
你介意我们试试吗？
You mind if we try?

1279
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:05,110
我是说 这家伙是有史以来最拉德低音播放器的
I mean, the dude is the most rad bass player, like, ever.

1280
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:06,590
是的
Yeah.

1281
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,220
请
Please.

1282
01:05:09,290 --> 01:05:11,030
-好的 -来吧
- Okay. - Come on.

1283
01:05:11,090 --> 01:05:13,300
-好的 -他是个白痴
- All right. - He's kind of a dick.

1284
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:15,060
好
Okay.

1285
01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:27,880
爸爸们 我们认为你应该在外面等
Dads, we think you should wait outside.

1286
01:05:44,990 --> 01:05:47,360
-哦 -对不起 死亡先生 先生
- Oh. - Excuse us, Mr. Death, sir.

1287
01:05:47,430 --> 01:05:49,400
好多见到你 死先生 先生
It's good to see you again, Mr. Death, sir.

1288
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:52,700
好吧 如果不是小比尔和小德
Well, if it isn't Little Bill and Little Ted.

1289
01:05:52,770 --> 01:05:55,200
我们仍然是你最超级的粉丝
We're still your hugest fans.

1290
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:56,610
是的
Yeah.

1291
01:05:57,740 --> 01:05:59,610
别对我捏造
Don't fudge with me.

1292
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:00,910
我们不会和你在一起 先生
We're not fudging with you, sir.

1293
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:02,580
-这是合法的 -是的
- It's legit. - Yeah.

1294
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:03,810
-真的吗？ -是的
- Really? - Yeah.

1295
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:05,180
我是说 孤独的灵魂冲浪者
I mean, The Lonely Soul Surfer

1296
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:08,180
是 1998 年最被低估的专辑
was the most underrated album in 1998.

1297
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:09,850
批评家们讨厌它
The critics hated it.

1298
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,150
他们还没准备好
Well, they just weren't ready

1299
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:12,790
一张所有低音的专辑
for an album that was all bass.

1300
01:06:12,850 --> 01:06:15,920
一切都在一起 他们说
"It was all over the place," they said.

1301
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:20,360
这是一个肆虐 混乱的烂摊子 他们说
"It was a raging, confused mess," they said.

1302
01:06:20,430 --> 01:06:25,470
这甚至比帕莱的苍白还要糟糕 他们说
"It was even worse than Pale on Pale," they said.

1303
01:06:25,530 --> 01:06:27,570
嗯
Well...

1304
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:30,870
是 在部分
It was, in parts.

1305
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:32,570
但在其他部分
But in other parts...

1306
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,310
我永远不会被爱
The outro in I'll Never Be Loved

1307
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:36,980
是最大胆的
is the most bodacious.

1308
01:06:37,050 --> 01:06:38,610
我是说 最后三个酒吧
I mean, the last three bars

1309
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:41,180
在《太苍白 不能哭》中的合唱之前
before the chorus in Too Pale to Cry...

1310
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:43,080
哦
Oh, well...

1311
01:06:43,150 --> 01:06:47,960
你觉得布吉和D医生在一起时钩怎么样？
What did you think of the hook in Boogie Down With Doctor D?

1312
01:06:48,020 --> 01:06:49,960
我们还有什么可说的？
What can we even say?

1313
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:53,560
疯狂 我们从来没有见过这样的左手技术
Insane. We've never seen left-hand technique like that.

1314
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:56,400
我知道！我是自学成才的
I know! I was self-taught.

1315
01:06:56,460 --> 01:07:00,170
你有一些疯狂的 疯狂的技能 伙计！
You have some crazy, crazy skills, dude!

1316
01:07:00,230 --> 01:07:02,700
嗯
Well...

1317
01:07:02,770 --> 01:07:04,870
-你知道你需要什么吗？ -嗯？
- You know what you need? - Hmm?

1318
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:08,510
你只需要一个乐队
You just need a band.

1319
01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:10,250
乐队需要你
And the band needs you.

1320
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:13,250
哦
Oh.

1321
01:07:13,310 --> 01:07:15,180
-T？ -B
- T? - B.

1322
01:07:19,390 --> 01:07:20,860
快进来
Come on in.

1323
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:23,320
爸爸
Dads,

1324
01:07:23,390 --> 01:07:26,430
你有什么要对死的人说的吗？
is there something you would like to say to Death?

1325
01:07:26,490 --> 01:07:29,700
哦
Oh...

1326
01:07:41,110 --> 01:07:45,150
我们为我们之间的事情感到抱歉 死亡
We're sorry for how things went between us, Death.

1327
01:07:45,210 --> 01:07:46,510
是的
Yeah.

1328
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:48,380
真诚抱歉
Sincerely sorry.

1329
01:07:50,090 --> 01:07:55,290
我很抱歉 名声在我脑海里
I am sorry that fame went to my head.

1330
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:59,130
很陶醉
It's very intoxicating.

1331
01:08:00,030 --> 01:08:04,030
我们真的喜欢跟你玩
We really did love playing with you, dude.

1332
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:07,230
我们真的摇滚了 不是吗？
We really did rock, didn't we?

1333
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:09,900
我们确实做到了
We definitely did.

1334
01:08:09,970 --> 01:08:12,410
如果还不算太晚 死亡
And if it's not too late, Death...

1335
01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:13,810
是的？
Yeah?

1336
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:17,580
你会考虑重新加入
Would you consider rejoining...

1337
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:20,750
威尔德·斯塔林斯？
Wyld Stallyns?

1338
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,190
哦 我
Oh... I...

1339
01:08:31,630 --> 01:08:33,600
我想
I suppose.

1340
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:51,450
好 我们走！
Okay, let's go!

1341
01:08:51,510 --> 01:08:53,810
右 右
Right. Right.

1342
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:01,090
是丹尼斯你好
It's Dennis. Hi.

1343
01:09:03,990 --> 01:09:05,660
-我迷路了 -进入 丹尼斯

哦 你好大家好
Oh, hello. Hello, everyone.

1347
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:13,500
嘿 嘿 是的 好的 朋友们
Hey. Hey. Yeah, okay, friends.

1348
01:09:13,570 --> 01:09:15,740
让我们摇滚吧！
Let's rock!

1349
01:09:23,210 --> 01:09:26,710
当你说 让我们摇滚吧 时 这很酷
It was cool when you said, "Let's rock,"

1350
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:29,450
因为它让我想摇滚
because it made me want to rock.

1351
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:31,050
嗯嗯
Uh-huh.

1352
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,650
你不只是去摇滚
You don't just get to rock.

1353
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:36,820
你必须赢得摇滚的权利
You got to earn the right to rock.

1354
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:40,530
哥们！我们有11分钟
Dude! We got 11 minutes.

1355
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:42,800
有人知道MP46 在哪里吗？
Anyone know where MP 46 is?

1356
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:44,300
取决于你的观点
Depends on your perspective.

1357
01:09:44,370 --> 01:09:46,270
要真正挖掘量子境界的凹槽
To really dig the groove of the quantum realm,

1358
01:09:46,330 --> 01:09:48,340
你得选择一个地方来挖掘它
you gotta choose a place to dig it from.

1359
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:49,840
挖？
Dig?

1360
01:09:51,170 --> 01:09:53,940
有人知道MP46 在哪里吗？
Anyone know where MP 46 is?

1361
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:02,280
我们永远不会飞出去
We're never gonna make our flight.

1362
01:10:07,990 --> 01:10:10,660
迪克 迪克看啊
Deac, Deac. Look at that.

1363
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,530

我们回来了！
We're back!

1367
01:10:27,510 --> 01:10:28,940
什么？
What?

1368
01:10:31,410 --> 01:10:32,880
这太糟糕了
This is bad.

1369
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:37,050
真的很糟糕
Really bad.

1370
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:40,220
好了 伙计们 我们走！
Okay, guys, let's go!

1371
01:10:42,790 --> 01:10:44,390

1372
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:46,130
来吧 莫扎特
Come on, Mozart.

1373
01:10:48,330 --> 01:10:49,730
哦Ted！即使我们知道
Oh, Ted! Even if we knew

1374
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,230
我们应该玩的地方
where we were supposed to play,

1375
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:53,770
我们不可能及时到达那里
there's no way we'd ever get there in time.

1376
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,840
比尔 看！
Bill, look!

1377
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:58,310
这是MP46？这是没有意义的
This is MP 46? It makes no sense.

1378
01:10:58,370 --> 01:11:00,910
这首歌怎么会在这里发生？
How can the song happen right here?

1379
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:04,610
因为这是它发生的地方
Because this is where it happened.

1380
01:11:05,210 --> 01:11:06,480
Ted你说得对 伙计！
Ted, you're right, dude!

1381
01:11:06,550 --> 01:11:09,950
但是 伙计 我们要玩什么？
But, dude, what're we gonna play?

1382
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:12,590
我不知道 伙计
I don't know, dude.

1383
01:11:16,190 --> 01:11:19,160
比尔和Ted？我保存了这些
Uh, Bill and Ted? I saved these.

1384
01:11:19,230 --> 01:11:21,000
我不确定
I'm not sure if...

1385
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:23,330
它们有什么用 但是
they're of any use, but...

1386
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,530
-谢谢 丹尼斯 -爸爸们！
- Thanks, Dennis. - Dads!

1387
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,600
爸爸！MP46

乐队已经准备好演奏了
And the band is ready to play.

1389
01:11:29,070 --> 01:11:31,570
我们需要的只是这首歌
Alls we need is the song.

1390
01:11:36,810 --> 01:11:38,510
西娅
Thea.

1391
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:39,910
比莉
Billie.

1392
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:43,280
我们不知道如何告诉你这些
We don't know how to tell you this.

1393
01:11:43,350 --> 01:11:45,990
我们没有这首歌
We don't have the song.

1394
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:48,390
等
Wait...

1395
01:11:48,790 --> 01:11:50,390
你不知道吗？
You don't?

1396
01:11:51,990 --> 01:11:53,690
不
No.

1397
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:55,560
很抱歉
We're sorry.

1398
01:11:55,630 --> 01:11:57,470
对不起 爸爸们
We're sorry, Dads.

1399
01:11:57,530 --> 01:12:00,500
是的 我们真的想帮你
Yeah, we really wanted to help you out with this.

1400
01:12:05,470 --> 01:12:08,510
你看到我所看到的了吗？
Dude, you seeing what I'm seeing?

1401
01:12:12,710 --> 01:12:14,250
普雷斯顿？
Preston?

1402
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:16,350
洛根？
Logan?

1403
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:21,190
普雷斯顿/洛根
Preston/Logan.

1404
01:12:22,690 --> 01:12:24,460
哇
Whoa.

1405
01:12:25,330 --> 01:12:27,630
怎么了 爸爸们？
What is it, Dads?

1406
01:12:27,690 --> 01:12:29,460
是你！
It's you!

1407
01:12:29,530 --> 01:12:30,860
什么？
What?

1408
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:33,930
一直都是你我们只是没有看到
It was you the whole time. We just didn't see it.

1409
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,270
我们不能写音乐
We can't write music.

1410
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:37,740
无论 我们只是听东西
Whatever... We just listen to stuff.

1411
01:12:37,810 --> 01:12:39,210
从我们喜欢的东西
From things we like.

1412
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:40,590
我们只是把东西放在一起
And we just kind of put stuff together.

1413
01:12:40,610 --> 01:12:42,140
也许你只是听一点
Yeah, maybe you just listen a little,

1414
01:12:42,210 --> 01:12:43,710
做你喜欢的东西
make things you like.

1415
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:45,480
并把它放在一起
And put it all together.

1416
01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:48,850
姑娘们 你们不是来支持我们的
Girls, you're not here to back us.

1417
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:51,750
我们在这里支持你
We're here to back you.

1418
01:12:51,820 --> 01:12:53,650
我们是你的乐队

1419
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,090

1423
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:11,570
伙计 我刚想到一些事情
Dude, I just thought of something.

1424
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:12,940
怎么了Ted？
What is it, Ted?

1425
01:13:13,010 --> 01:13:15,440
听一首歌怎么样
How is just listening to a song...

1426
01:13:15,510 --> 01:13:17,850
要团结全世界
...gonna unite the whole world...

1427
01:13:17,910 --> 01:13:20,080
一直所有的时间？
...throughout all of time?

1428
01:13:20,780 --> 01:13:23,320
这是个好问题
That is a good question, dude.

1429
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,660
这几乎就像他们都得听一样
It's almost like they'd all have to hear it

1430
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:31,260
为了发挥它
in order to play it.

1431
01:13:31,330 --> 01:13:33,250
当然是Ted！我们就是这样团结他们的
Ted, of course! That's how we're gonna unite 'em.

1432
01:13:33,290 --> 01:13:34,730
我们让他们一起玩
We get 'em to play along.

1433
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,380
好吧 如果这是真的 我们要做的就是
Well, if that's true, alls we gotta do is

1434
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:37,780
得到每个人所有的时间
get to everyone throughout all time.

1435
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:40,070
是的 给他们拿乐器 伙计

7分25秒
In seven minutes and 25 seconds.

1437
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,270
那坦布林呢？
What about a tambourine?

1438
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:46,310
我是说 用那个摇滚会有多难？
I mean, how hard can it be to rock with that?

1439
01:13:46,370 --> 01:13:49,510
坦布林不像看起来那么容易
Tambourine is not as easy as it looks.

1440
01:13:49,580 --> 01:13:52,410
跳舞怎么样？我是个很有天赋的舞蹈家
What about dancing? I'm a very gifted dancer.

1441
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:53,980
你会跳舞吗？

1442
01:13:54,050 --> 01:13:55,620
-M -嗯 -真的吗？

1443
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:59,790

Why don't you go over there and rehearse your dance?

1444
01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:01,520
好
Okay.

1445
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:03,760
伙计 我们没有力量！
Dude, we have no power!

1446
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:05,030
不再说 在它
Say no more. On it.

1447
01:14:05,090 --> 01:14:06,360
好
Okay.

1448
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:22,240

我们做到了

1454
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:34,590
我们意识到我们在这个现实中最幸福
We realized we're happiest in this reality.

1455
01:14:34,660 --> 01:14:36,290
甜！
Sweet!

1456
01:14:39,230 --> 01:14:41,530
我们听到你说了些什么
Now, um, did we hear you say something about

1457
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:44,530
一直分发乐器？

1460
01:14:54,410 --> 01:14:57,380
哦 我的天 发生什么事了？
Oh, my God, what's happening?

1461
01:14:58,010 --> 01:14:59,610
对不起 库迪先生 先生？
Excuse me, Mr. Cudi, sir?

1462
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:01,920
我们的妻子刚刚走过多重现实
Our wives just traveled through multiple realities.

1463
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:03,260
这样做 他们意识到
And in doing so, they realized...

1464
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:04,450
他们都发生了
They're all happening

1465
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:05,800
-同时 -同时
- simultaneously. - Simultaneously.

1466
01:15:05,820 --> 01:15:07,350
我们需要个人我们
Do we need individual us's

1467
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:09,590
把乐器带到无限的地方？
to take instruments to infinite places?

1468
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:13,030
好 看 与一些人争论的相反
Okay. See, contrary to what some have argued,

1469
01:15:13,090 --> 01:15:14,800
万能波函数是
universal wave function is,

1470
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:16,300
从认识学上讲
epistemologically speaking,

1471
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:17,820
循环和分离 换句话说
both cyclic and separating. In other words...

1472
01:15:17,830 --> 01:15:19,770
对不起 库迪孩子我不是故意无礼的
Excuse me, Kid Cudi. I don't mean to be rude,

1473
01:15:19,830 --> 01:15:22,340
但我们有四分半钟
but we have, like, four and a half minutes.

1474
01:15:23,670 --> 01:15:28,180
夫人 夫人！我们得走了 在这里不安全
Madam. Madam! We have to go. It's not safe to be in here.

你想去哪里？
Where were you thinking of going?

1476
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:47,830
我想是月食
I think it's a lunar eclipse.

1477
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:49,900
这不是月球 你们
That is not lunar, you guys.

1478
01:15:55,230 --> 01:15:57,200
这是一场灾难 T
This is a disaster, T.

1479
01:15:57,270 --> 01:15:59,040
我们该怎么办 B？

停止！
Stop!

1481
01:16:08,050 --> 01:16:10,820
所有你需要做的就是进入量子叠加
All you need to do is go in the quantum superposition

1482
01:16:10,890 --> 01:16:12,050
具有多重现实
with multiple realities.

1483
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:13,850
但如何呢？
But how?

1484
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,210
伙计们 展位显然是通往量子领域的隧道
Dudes, the booth is obviously a tunnel to the quantum realm.

1485
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:17,690
走 走 走！
