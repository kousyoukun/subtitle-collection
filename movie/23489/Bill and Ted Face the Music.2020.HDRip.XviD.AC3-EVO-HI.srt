00:00:41,698 --> 00:00:45,102
I'm Bill S. Preston, Esquire.

And I'm Ted "Theodore" Logan.

BOTH: And we're Wyld Stallyns!

BILLIE: <i>This was probably
the first time you saw 'em.</i>

BOTH: Let's rock!

THEA: <i>And this
was probably the last.</i>

BILLIE: <i>Not long
before we were born,</i>

they were gonna write a song</i>

unite the entire world.</i>

BILLIE: <i>Not only did it not
unite the world,</i>

19
00:01:17,468 --> 00:01:19,370
<i>but the band fell apart.</i>

20
00:01:19,436 --> 00:01:24,008
<i>And our dads, alone now,
were trying harder and harder.</i>

21
00:01:24,075 --> 00:01:26,844
THEA: <i>But the problem was,
the harder Dads tried...</i>

22

BILLIE: <i>The less interested</i>

on them and on the family...</i>

25

BILLIE: <i>But the universe

<i>they were gonna
bring together...</i>

27
00:01:37,888 --> 00:01:40,057
THEA: <i>Was actually
starting to unravel.</i>

28
00:01:40,123 --> 00:01:43,227
BILLIE: <i>Yeah,
time was folding in on itself.</i>

29
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:45,295
<i>It was bad.</i>

30

we got to where we are now.</i>

BILL: Hello,
friends and loved ones.

36
00:02:02,813 --> 00:02:04,781
Let us welcome you,
one and all

37
00:02:04,847 --> 00:02:07,951
to this
most joyous of occasions!

38
00:02:12,288 --> 00:02:14,890
Ted and I have known Missy
in different capacities

39
00:02:14,957 --> 00:02:16,860
for many decades.

40
00:02:16,926 --> 00:02:19,695
First, she was our babysitter
when we were ten.

41
00:02:19,763 --> 00:02:21,865
Then we both invited her
to the prom

42
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:23,966
when she was a senior
and we were freshmen.

43
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:25,269
BILL: (SOFTLY) Yeah!

44
00:02:25,335 --> 00:02:27,671
Two years later,
she married my dad

45
00:02:27,736 --> 00:02:29,606
and Missy became Mom.

46
00:02:29,673 --> 00:02:33,376
After divorcing Bill's dad,
she married my dad

47
00:02:33,443 --> 00:02:35,145
and became my mom.

48
00:02:35,211 --> 00:02:36,478
Yeah.

49
00:02:36,545 --> 00:02:38,414
And now she's marrying
Ted's little brother,

50
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,483
Officer Deacon Logan.

52
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:45,956
Yeah.

53
00:02:46,522 --> 00:02:48,359
Missy, Bill and I,

54
00:02:48,425 --> 00:02:50,961

Elizabeth,

55

56
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:57,434
And my beautiful wife, Joanna,
and our daughter, Thea,

57
00:02:57,501 --> 00:02:59,536
all wanna welcome you back...

58
00:02:59,602 --> 00:03:01,472
BOTH: With open arms.

(APPLAUSE)

60
00:03:04,441 --> 00:03:05,908
This happy event
would seem to make

61
00:03:05,975 --> 00:03:07,677
Deacon his own father-in-law

62
00:03:07,743 --> 00:03:09,180
and Ted his own uncle.

63
00:03:09,246 --> 00:03:12,983
Not to mention making my dad
his own son.

beautiful thought in mind,

66
00:03:16,186 --> 00:03:17,754
for your first dance,

67
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,824
we wish to present you
with a matrimonial offering.

of our newest sonic creation.

70
00:03:24,527 --> 00:03:26,162
We're not sure
if this is going to be

71
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:28,131
the song
that unites the world.

72
00:03:28,198 --> 00:03:29,599
We're pretty sure it might.

73
00:03:29,665 --> 00:03:32,468
- At least we hope.
- Yeah.

You got it, Kissy Missy.

80
00:03:52,354 --> 00:03:54,657
Oh, shh.
Your dad used to call me that.

81
00:03:54,724 --> 00:03:56,192
Totally aware of that, babe.

Chief Logan, the people

00:05:32,488 --> 00:05:33,789
Bill, Bill, Bill,
you didn't time-travel.

100

TED: We did.

101

Your wives
aren't from medieval England.

LOGAN: And you didn't go
to Heaven and Hell.

And you know why?

107

Because it's impossible.

108

Here's a real idea
for you two.

109

Here it comes, dude.

and they're unemployed.

116
00:06:02,052 --> 00:06:03,754

00:06:08,257 --> 00:06:10,159
Yeah. Well, it turned out
to be a curse.

121
00:06:10,226 --> 00:06:13,362

sit around, listen to music.

- JOANNA: Don't listen to him.
- TED: Ouch.

131
00:06:31,447 --> 00:06:33,348
I really appreciate you
doing this.

132
00:06:33,415 --> 00:06:34,783
I know it wasn't your choice.

133
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,286
Of course, Jo.

134
00:06:36,353 --> 00:06:37,920
I really want this
to work for both of us.

135
00:06:37,987 --> 00:06:39,422
Yeah.

136
00:06:39,488 --> 00:06:41,057

Oh, no, no.

141
00:06:46,196 --> 00:06:47,797
I'm sorry,
is this the right day?

142
00:06:47,863 --> 00:06:49,599
(CHUCKLING) Yeah, totally.

143
00:06:49,665 --> 00:06:52,735
So, do you understand
why this situation

144
00:06:52,802 --> 00:06:56,173
might seem at all strange
to your wives?

145
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,742
No. Not at all.
Why?

146
00:06:58,809 --> 00:07:02,445
Well, when your wives
suggested couples therapy,

147
00:07:02,512 --> 00:07:05,482
do you think that this is
what they had in mind?

148
00:07:05,548 --> 00:07:06,782
Well, definitely.

149
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,052
I mean, we're
a couple of couples, right?

150
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:10,520
- That is true.
- Yeah.

151
00:07:10,586 --> 00:07:13,689
But usually,
with couples therapy,

152
00:07:13,755 --> 00:07:14,957
it just means one couple.

153
00:07:15,024 --> 00:07:16,125
That makes sense.

154
00:07:16,192 --> 00:07:17,627
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

155
00:07:17,694 --> 00:07:19,194
DR. WOOD: Well, but, you know,
we're here,

156
00:07:19,262 --> 00:07:20,697
so let's work with that.

157
00:07:20,764 --> 00:07:21,898
- Yes?
- BILL: Yeah.

158
00:07:21,964 --> 00:07:23,532
Okay, great.

159
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
Um...

160
00:07:24,668 --> 00:07:26,903
Ted, is there something
you feel

161
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,805
your wife needs to hear
from you?

162
00:07:28,872 --> 00:07:31,074
Yeah. Totally.

DR. WOOD: In a way, yes.

166
00:07:39,482 --> 00:07:42,119
I mean,
it is great to feel loved.

167
00:07:42,185 --> 00:07:44,454
But do you understand

168
00:07:44,521 --> 00:07:47,390
how that might sound strange
to your wives?

169
00:07:47,456 --> 00:07:49,293
I'll shoot this at Bill.

170
00:07:50,026 --> 00:07:51,026
No.

Oh. "We love them."

- Yeah.
- Yeah. We do.

174
00:07:55,997 --> 00:07:58,300
Okay. It's the "we" part.

175
00:07:58,367 --> 00:08:01,404
Um... Ted, can you say
the same thing,

176
00:08:01,471 --> 00:08:05,274
but instead of "we,"
say "I" in the sentence.

like to respond to that?

all this way for this.

00:15:17,974 --> 00:15:19,442
Be...

329
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:21,576
excellent to each other.

330
00:15:21,644 --> 00:15:23,379
And party on, dudes.

331
00:15:23,446 --> 00:15:25,048
Yeah.

332
00:15:25,681 --> 00:15:27,850
Twenty-five years ago,

333
00:15:27,917 --> 00:15:30,586
Wyld Stallyns played a concert

334
00:15:30,653 --> 00:15:32,388
at the Grand Canyon.

335
00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:34,456
That's true.

336
00:15:34,524 --> 00:15:36,525
One month ago,

337
00:15:36,591 --> 00:15:38,126
you played the Elks Lodge

338
00:15:38,193 --> 00:15:40,329
in Barstow, California,
for 40 people,

339
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:43,899
most of whom were there only
because it was $2 taco night,

340
00:15:43,966 --> 00:15:45,600
whatever the hell that means.

341
00:15:45,668 --> 00:15:48,871
- Well, yeah. We did!
- Yeah. We did!

342
00:15:50,806 --> 00:15:55,045
You were supposed to
unite the world in song.

343
00:16:00,383 --> 00:16:02,084
According to her father,

344
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:05,587
a song
created by Preston/Logan...

345
00:16:05,654 --> 00:16:07,089
(WHISPERS) That's us, dude.

346
00:16:07,157 --> 00:16:11,259
...at a concert performed
by everyone in the band

347
00:16:11,326 --> 00:16:13,495
at 7:17 p.m.

348
00:16:13,562 --> 00:16:15,664
at MP 46,

349
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:17,866
that's tonight,

350
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:20,536
will save reality
as we know it,

351
00:16:20,602 --> 00:16:24,940
uniting humanity
across all time.

352
00:16:25,508 --> 00:16:26,743
Wait...

353
00:16:26,808 --> 00:16:28,677
I'm sorry.

354
00:16:28,745 --> 00:16:30,312
What?

355
00:16:30,379 --> 00:16:32,480
Did you say,

356
00:16:32,548 --> 00:16:35,750
"Reality as we know it"?

357
00:16:35,817 --> 00:16:37,886
ALL: (ECHOES) Yes!

358
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,894
BOTH: Oh.

359
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:52,168
BOTH: Whoa.

360
00:16:53,369 --> 00:16:55,971
THE GREAT LEADER:
We need to hear the song

361
00:16:56,038 --> 00:17:00,109
in 77 minutes and 25 seconds.

362
00:17:00,176 --> 00:17:03,379
You have
everything you require.

363
00:17:03,446 --> 00:17:05,781
Get to work.

364
00:17:06,648 --> 00:17:09,417
Dude, they totally hate us.

365
00:17:09,484 --> 00:17:12,587
(SIGHS) And I've never even
heard of MP 46.

366
00:17:12,654 --> 00:17:14,257
Yeah.

367
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,825
Kelly!

368
00:17:16,526 --> 00:17:19,062
How does a song save reality?

369
00:17:19,128 --> 00:17:21,996
That I can't tell you,
but it has to.

370
00:17:22,064 --> 00:17:23,932
Somehow.

371
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,301
The Great Turntable
is tipping.

372
00:17:26,368 --> 00:17:29,504
That there is the center
of space and time.

373
00:17:29,571 --> 00:17:33,308
San Dimas 700 years ago,
7:17 p.m.

374
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,610
My father believed
that the song

375
00:17:35,678 --> 00:17:37,580
could be the nexus point
that brings

376
00:17:37,646 --> 00:17:39,347
humanity into rhythm
and harmony.

377
00:17:39,414 --> 00:17:41,017
How?

378
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,986
KELLY: We only discovered
this recently, but without it,

379
00:17:43,051 --> 00:17:44,753
reality will collapse,

380
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,790
and time and space
will cease to exist.

381
00:17:48,891 --> 00:17:51,728
So until 7:17 p.m...

382
00:17:51,794 --> 00:17:53,461
Anything is possible.

383
00:17:53,528 --> 00:17:55,364
And after 7:17 p.m.?

384
00:17:55,431 --> 00:18:00,269
Without the song,
there is no after 7:17 p.m.

385
00:18:06,442 --> 00:18:09,411
This was my dad's.
He'd want you to have it.

386
00:18:09,478 --> 00:18:13,048
It'll help keep track
of the time in San Dimas.

394
00:18:43,378 --> 00:18:44,847
Now alls we gotta do

395
00:18:44,913 --> 00:18:46,915
is write the greatest song
ever written.

396
00:18:46,982 --> 00:18:50,685
That brings the entire world
into rhythm and harmony.

397
00:18:50,752 --> 00:18:53,855
And saves reality
as we know it.

We've spent our whole life

402
00:19:03,699 --> 00:19:06,101
trying to write the song
that will unite the world.

403
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:09,170
What makes us think we can
write it in, like, 75 minutes?

404
00:19:09,238 --> 00:19:11,039
Ted, we had to have written
that song.

405
00:19:11,106 --> 00:19:13,442
The people in the future
told us we did.

406
00:19:13,509 --> 00:19:15,377
Yeah. I guess.

407
00:19:15,444 --> 00:19:18,513
Which means
we have it in us, dude.

408
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,915
Maybe we just haven't
written it yet.

409
00:19:20,982 --> 00:19:22,417
Maybe we're still gonna.

410
00:19:22,484 --> 00:19:24,152
Well, if we haven't
written it yet,

411
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,622
but we know
we're gonna at some point,

412
00:19:26,689 --> 00:19:28,824
why can't we just
go to the future

413
00:19:28,891 --> 00:19:30,993
when we have written it?

414
00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:33,229
And take it from ourselves!

415
00:19:33,296 --> 00:19:34,963
Yeah!

416
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:36,898
Ted! You have had many

417
00:19:36,965 --> 00:19:39,067
counterintuitive ideas
over the years,

418
00:19:39,134 --> 00:19:40,537
but this is by far

419
00:19:40,603 --> 00:19:43,273
the counterintuitivest
of them all, dude!

420
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,876
Except, won't that be stealing?

421
00:19:49,478 --> 00:19:51,346
How is that stealing

422
00:19:51,413 --> 00:19:54,817
if we're stealing it
from ourselves, dude?

423
00:19:55,584 --> 00:19:57,821
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

424
00:20:00,256 --> 00:20:02,192

425

TED: Yeah.

426
00:20:06,028 --> 00:20:08,463
How far into our future
do you think we gotta go?

427
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:11,099
It depends on when we think
we wrote that song.

428
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:14,269
Let's be conservative.
Say, two years?

429
00:20:14,336 --> 00:20:15,538
Sounds good, Ted.

430
00:20:15,605 --> 00:20:16,971
Then, once we get the song,

431
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:19,142
we'll go back home
to right before we left.

432

I just wanna say
thank you, Bill,

for all the times
you've been there for me.

That's my fault.

1141
00:54:20,112 --> 00:54:23,616
I never truly opened
myself up to you.

1142
00:54:23,682 --> 00:54:28,322
The truth is, I looked at you
and saw myself.

1143
00:54:29,121 --> 00:54:33,360
Yeah. I know. Me, too.

1144
00:54:33,427 --> 00:54:38,666
I'm sorry for the times
I let you down, Bill.

you were sent here

01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,128
Yeah, thanks, Chief Logan!

1293
01:01:15,195 --> 01:01:16,997
I wasn't talking to you, Bill.

1294
01:01:17,063 --> 01:01:19,031
Oh. Cool.

1295
01:01:19,099 --> 01:01:21,902
Well, Dads, this is the band
we put together for you.

1296
01:01:21,967 --> 01:01:24,770
This is Jimi Hendrix,
Louis Armstrong...

1297
01:01:24,838 --> 01:01:28,575
And Mozart,
and Ling Lun, and Grom.

1298

JIMI HENDRIX:
A pleasure, gentlemen.

1299
01:01:31,344 --> 01:01:33,746
You raised
two fine young girls.

1300
01:01:33,813 --> 01:01:35,449
- BOTH: Thank you.
- BILLIE: And this is Kid Cudi

who's not technically
a historical figure.

1302

- Kinda am now, I think.
- Yeah.

1303

It's a great honor
to meet you all.

1304

Yeah. Welcome to,
and sorry about, Hell.

that I lasered you all.

And...

1312
01:02:03,275 --> 01:02:05,311
I just need to tell you...

My name is
Dennis Caleb McCoy, and...

1314
01:02:10,117 --> 01:02:12,119
TED: Thank you, Dennis.

1315

Well, thanks for
coming to get us.

1316

How're we gonna
get outta here?

1317
01:02:15,454 --> 01:02:16,923
We're gonna go talk to Death.

1318
01:02:16,989 --> 01:02:19,892
Oh. Well, isn't he still mad
at you guys?

1319
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,260
Oh, yeah.

1320
01:02:21,327 --> 01:02:23,061
- And we're still mad at him.
- Yeah.

1321
01:02:23,128 --> 01:02:24,563
Oh.

1322
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:25,931
Nineteen minutes.

Everyone, follow us.

Is he playing Hopscotch
by himself?

DEATH: I have
bested you again.

He looks miserable, dude.

DEATH: Yes! (LAUGHS)

Yes!

Have you come to sue me again?

TED: No, Death. Not at all.

No. We just need
to talk to you, Death.

Bill and Ted!

What? Did your
restraining order run out?

1350
01:03:35,534 --> 01:03:37,503
Did the judge change his mind?

1351
01:03:37,570 --> 01:03:41,106
So, now I am allowed
to get close to you? Hmm?

1352
01:03:41,173 --> 01:03:42,208
Is this too close?

We didn't want to sue you,
dude.

- Remember, be sweet, dude.
- You're right.

1356
01:03:48,947 --> 01:03:52,684
You tried to take the name
Wyld Stallyns.

1357
01:03:52,751 --> 01:03:54,721
I was Wyld Stallyns.

1358
01:03:54,788 --> 01:03:56,255
What are you talking about?

1359
01:03:56,322 --> 01:03:58,990
You kicked me out
because you was jealous of me.

1360
01:03:59,057 --> 01:04:00,726
- No, no, no, dude.
- Yes, yes, yes.

1361
01:04:00,793 --> 01:04:02,695
You quit the band
to go out on your own!

1362
01:04:02,762 --> 01:04:04,264
You wouldn't let me play!

1363
01:04:04,331 --> 01:04:07,266
Dude, you were playing
40-minute bass solos.

1364

No one but you could play!

I was in the groove!

- What?
- Those 40-minute solos,

1367
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:17,009
that was the highlight
of your shows.

1368

you went down in the tubes.

we came here is 'cause

01:04:30,891 --> 01:04:32,659
we have to play a song
at some place

- like, right now.
- Hmm.

All of time is gonna fold
in on itself, dude.

I have been demoted down here

1378
01:04:42,068 --> 01:04:46,405
because I took two so-called
"friends" back up

back up.
