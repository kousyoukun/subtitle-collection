这样的风都不吉利

你怎么获得许可的
So uh. How'd you land it?

66

这还是头一回啊 阿玛迦可从不接受采访
This is like pioneer stuff. Amajagh has never given an interview.

你是恐怖分子吗 将军

74
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,990
他们没告诉我做采访的是位女士
They did not tell me the interview was with a lady.

75
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,990
我不是女士 我是记者

76
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:22,910
我这个人 什么都没有
What I am, is a man with nothing,

77

这些雇佣兵的开销是谁出的 将军

夜晚在我们头上飞过的无人机又是谁出的钱
Who pays for the drones that passed over our heads at night?

80

美国已声明在你们国家的内战中

拥有权力的人既不会遵从
Men with power obey neither

跟她无关

101
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,410
我们只是用她的身份做掩护

102
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,960
她什么都不知道

103
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,540
没事的 露易丝
It's okay, Lois.

There's still civilians in the compound. We'll extract her.

无知和无辜
Ignorance is not the same...

118

他级别太低 什么都不知道

The theory is that the Russian lead me to the man himself.

240

如果他真的是个人

283
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:09,170
国家安全?
Homeland Security?

284
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:12,230
不 不 不 女士 是星球安全
No, no, no... ma'am. Planetary Security.

285
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,740
这个碎块是放射性外太空矿物
The fragment is of a radio active Xeno mineral

286
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,190
我们怀疑它或许有生物交互作用
We suspected it might have bio interactions,

287
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:17,630
所以 我们把样本给了陆军传染病医学研究所
so, we took the sample to amriid.

290
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:24,020
那里保留着氪星死者的遗体
Where they keep the remains of the Kryptonian decedent.

291
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,450
当我们将这个矿物接触佐德将军时
And, when we exposed general Zod to the mineral,

292
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:29,140
发生了这样的情况
this happened.

293
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:33,710

Profound biodegradation, decaying Kryptonian cells.

294
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:36,920
我们断定 如果找到一个足够大的样本 就能武器化这种矿物
We concluded the mineral could be weaponized, if a large enough sample was found.

295
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:40,900

需要你们的一张进口许可证
what he needs from you is an import license.

301
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:56,470
我们为什么要武器化这种物质
And why would we want to weaponize this material?

302
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:58,490
用来威慑 预备一颗银弹
As a deterrent. A silver bullet to keep in reserve

但是 如果铸造一颗

Well, then...

00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,400
你觉得我爸是不会介意的吧

他破坏了宙斯毁灭人类的计划

523
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:10,000
为此 他遭到了雷劈

524
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,710
似乎很不公平

书本就是知识 知识就是力量

544

而我... 不...

545
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,160

不
No.

嘿 你不能带我去普通牢房
Hey, you can't bring me to general.

679
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,000
你应该感谢大都会的纳税人们
You should be thanking the tax payers of Metropolis

680
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,620
收容你这被烙的混蛋
for taking in your branded ass.

681
00:57:49,830 --> 00:57:51,080
- 请签字 - 我被标记了 老兄
- Sign in please. - I'm marked, man.

682
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,330
你知道他们对有这东西的人会做什么吗
You know what they do to people with this on them?

683
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:53,290
他只是个罪犯
He's only a criminal.

684
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:55,890
- 这边 快走 他们会杀了我
- This way! Let's go! - They're gonna kill me!

685
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:57,380
- 他们会杀了我 - 快走
- They're gonna kill me! - Let's go!

686
00:57:57,710 --> 00:58:01,640
基夫 你被保释了 打开二号
Keefe, you made bail. Open Two.

687
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:07,970
谁出的钱
Who paid?

688
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,320
你到底是谁
Who the hell are you?

689
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:29,000
- 就是个人而已 - 是吗
- Just a man. - Yeah?

690
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:30,830
你他妈想干嘛
What the fuck you want?

691
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:37,370
帮你坐稳立场
To help you stand for something.

692
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:43,800
你三点的预约到了
Your 3 o'clock's here.

693
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:56,530
他让我成了一个不完整的男人
He made me half a man.

694
00:58:58,170 --> 00:58:59,400
我妻子
My wife...

695
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,270
离开了我
...walked out on me.

696
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:07,300
我甚至不能站着小便
I can't even piss standing up.

697
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:10,030
让我对质他
Let me face him.

698
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,630
你会处理好吧?
You'll take care of it?

699
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:16,030
很好
Good.

700
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:42,900
怎么了
What?

701
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:56,070
退后 让开
Back up! Make a hole!

702
01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:03,030
走错地方了 小姐
Wrong room, miss.

703
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,700
斯万维克部长 你一直没回我电话
Secretary Swanwick, you haven't been returning my phone calls.

704
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:13,300
莱恩小姐 如果你想采访 那扇门外面就能找到法里斯少校
Miss Lane, if you like an interview, Major Farris is just outside that door.

705
01:00:13,330 --> 01:00:15,730
你把我当成陌生人?
You're treating me like a stranger?

706
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:18,800
我把你当成记者
I'm treating you like a reporter.

707
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:19,980
好吧
Alright.

708
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,270
美国在向非洲的反叛军提供实验性军用武器吗
Is the US providing experimental military arms to rebels in Africa?

709
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:26,470
你这么有胆量的人
You know with balls like yours.

710
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:28,690
应该属于这里
You belong in here.

711
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:32,020
你的消息来源是什么 锡箔帽吗
What's your source on this? A tin foil hat?

712
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:34,340
不是锡 是金属
No, not tin, but it's metal.

713
01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:38,110
在那次超人事件中射出的 五角大楼的专家都无法识别它
Fired in the Superman incident. Experts at the Pentagon can't ID it.

714
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:40,710
- 我们没有被告知真相 - 真相就是
- We haven't been told the truth. - Here's the truth.

715
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:43,580
一名记者贪求独家新闻 去了她不该去的地方
A reporter got greedy for a scoop and went where she shouldn't have.

716
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:48,240
超人救她时 就像兵痞似的 还导致了多人死亡
Superman acted like some... rogue combatant to rescue her and people died.

717
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:51,880
不要用编造阴谋论来放回他的圣环
Don't invent a conspiracy theory to put back his halo.

718
01:00:52,550 --> 01:00:54,160
或你的圣环
Or yours.

719
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:56,230
- 少校 - 长官
- Major. - Sir.

720
01:00:57,770 --> 01:01:00,770
我登录了你的网盘找复件

但却没有关于橄榄球的 没有关于...
But, nothing about football. Nothing about...

726
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:10,820
大都会图书馆的那些朋友的 只有...
Friends of the Metropolis Library, just...

727
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:15,910
该死的哥谭蝙蝠的事 我跟你说了别追
The god damn Gotham bat thing, I told you not to pursue.

728
01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:18,210
警方不会帮忙 媒体不得不做正确的事
The police won't help, the press has to do the right thing.

729
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:19,850
轮不到你来决定是什么正确的
You don't get to decide what the right thing is.

730
01:01:19,870 --> 01:01:22,300
星球报社成立时 是有立场的 佩里
When the Planet was founded, it stood for something, Perry.

731
01:01:22,330 --> 01:01:26,220
1938年时 的确如此 但现在不是1938年
So could you, if it was 1938, but it's not 1938.

732
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:29,570
公共事业振兴署不再雇人了 一堆苹果也不再只值几分钱
WPA aren't hiring no more. Apples don't cost a nickel.

733
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:32,930
这里不准追 外面也不准 放掉这件事
Not in here. Not out there. You drop this thing.

734
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:37,810
没人在意克拉克·肯特叫板蝙蝠侠
Nobody cares about Clark Kent taking on the Batman.

735
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:41,980
所以很显然 超人
So apparently superman

736
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:44,350
不再希望我们把他当成美国人
doesn't want us to think of him as American anymore.

737
01:01:44,350 --> 01:01:45,320
说真的 我们何必呢
And really, why would we?

738
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,680
我意思是除了那身红蓝服装 还有...
I mean aside from the red and blue costume. And...

739
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:49,820
怎么说呢 美利坚合众国的
I don't know, the fact that he has

740
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:51,990
英文缩写 有三分之一都在他的胸口上了
one-third of the usa's initials on his chest.

741
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:53,590
我猜他没有把独立宣言
I assume the only reason he's not wearing

742
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:56,560
当披风来穿的唯一原因就是...
the declaration of independence as a cape is...

743
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:57,900
他觉得这样做太招摇了
He thinks it's too on- the- nose.

744
01:01:57,900 --> 01:01:59,630
- 这里在搞什么 - 不好
- What is going on back here? - No.

745
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:00,870
伙计们 快点 走了
Guys, come on. Let's go.

746
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:02,870
打起精神 快出去
Get yourselves together and get out there.

747
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:04,000
把那些玻璃杯都放托盘上
Get those glasses on those trays.

748
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,470
外面有客人口渴着呢
We got thirsty people out there.

749
01:02:05,470 --> 01:02:07,590
半满 记住 半满
Half full. Remember, half full.

750
01:02:14,310 --> 01:02:15,800
我们能失陪一下吗
I wonder, would you excuse us?

751
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,030
- 我想带你看样东西 - 抱歉
- There's something I'd like to show you. - I'm sorry.

752
01:02:18,950 --> 01:02:22,250
现在有些学者坚持认为那件事从没发生过...
Now some scholars insist that it never happened...

753
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:24,250
但我相信那种行为
But I believe it's the action

754
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:29,120
完全符合一个既是国王又是变态杀手的人
perfectly in keeping with a king who was also a psychopathic killer.

755
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:32,900
对我而言 这是40年策展的巅峰
For me, it's the culmination of 40 years curating.

756
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:35,900
我简直不敢相信 我终于把它弄来了
And I can't believe it, but I've finally got it here.

757
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:39,230
它就是亚历山大之剑
It's the sword of Alexander.

758
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:43,540
砍断戈尔迪之结的那把剑
It's the blade that cut the gordian knot.

759
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,440
这是一场胜利
It's a triumph.

760
01:02:47,450 --> 01:02:48,340
的确
Yes.

761
01:02:48,910 --> 01:02:50,310
- 好好欣赏吧 - 谢谢
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

762
01:02:57,990 --> 01:02:59,690
这是一件赝品
It's a fake.

763
01:02:59,690 --> 01:03:02,490
真品在98年时在黑市上被卖了
The real one was sold in '98 on the black market.

764
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:03,660
现在它挂在...
And now it hangs...

765
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:06,000
挂在哈杰尔苏丹的床上方
Over the bed of the sultan of hajar.

766
01:03:09,270 --> 01:03:10,900
失陪了
Excuse me.

767
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:13,940
不好意思 小姐
Excuse me, miss.

768
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:17,170
前几天晚上 你拿了不属于你的东西
The other night you took something that doesn't belong to you.

769
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:18,910
偷是没教养的
Stealing's not polite.

770
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:22,010
如果从另一个小偷那儿偷 也算偷吗
Is it stealing if you steal from another thief?

771
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:25,480
你是什么人
Who are you?

772
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:28,050
某个和你关注同一个人的人
Someone interested in the same man you are.

773
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:30,340
是吗
Is that right?

774
01:03:30,990 --> 01:03:34,060
我相信卢瑟先生有一张属于我的照片
I believe Mr. Luthor has a photograph that belongs to me.

775
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,050
你拿到了吗
Did you get it?

776
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,680
事实上 没 我没拿到
As it happens, no, I didn't.

777
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:41,200
你复制的数据都有军工级加密
The data you copied has military- grade encryption.

778
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,890
我用你这身礼服打赌
You know, i bet with that dress,

779
01:03:44,890 --> 01:03:47,310
十个男人里有九个愿意让你顺走任何东西
9 out of 10 men will let you get away with anything.

780
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:49,170
但你是那第十个?
But you're the 10th?

781
01:03:49,170 --> 01:03:51,570
我想我是第一个
I'm guessing I'm the first

782
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:53,940
看穿你那低幼把戏的男人
to see through that babe-in-the-woods act.

783
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:56,680
你不了解我
You don't know me,

784
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:58,570
但我认识几个你这样的女人
but I've known a few women like you.

785
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:04,750
我可不觉得你见过我这样的女人
Oh, I don't think you've ever known a woman like me.

786
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:09,530
人们对于小男孩的说法一点没错
You know, it's true what they say about little boys.

787
01:04:09,530 --> 01:04:12,290
天生不会分享
Born with no natural inclination to share.

788
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,730
我没偷你的硬盘
I didn't steal your drive.

789
01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:17,050
我只是借用
I borrowed it.

790
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,970
你会在你车上的储物箱里找到它的
You'll find it in the glove compartment of your car.

791
01:04:22,210 --> 01:04:23,310
再见 韦恩先生
Mr. Wayne.

796
01:04:43,030 --> 01:04:46,200
密解中

797
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:17,690
你们拿到了吗
Did you get it?

798
01:06:17,690 --> 01:06:19,020
那块石头
The rock?

799
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:20,360
我们拿到了
Yeah, we got it.

800
01:06:31,730 --> 01:06:32,870

I'm sorry.

蹲下 快蹲下
Get down! Get down now!

803
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:09,010
不
No!

804
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:04,720
她是我的世界
She was my world.

805
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:08,260
而你把她从我这夺走了
And you took her from me.

806
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:20,940
布鲁斯
Bruce!

807
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:23,820
布鲁斯 现在听我说

Am I too soon?

812

我来太早了
I'm too soon!

Please, madam. I beg of you! Please don't do this!

955
01:23:51,570 --> 01:23:53,070
这十分重要
This is so important!

956
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:55,060
- 跟我来 - 别碰我

958
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:01,860
我没告诉你真相
I didn't tell you the truth.

959
01:24:02,390 --> 01:24:05,290
中情局认为沙漠那件事是个圈套
C.I.A Thinks the desert was a setup.

960
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:07,460
有人想加罪于超人
Somebody wanted superman to look guilty.

961
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:10,580
那子弹呢
The bullet?

962
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:20,420
那种金属是一家私人公司开发的
The metal was developed by a private company.

963
01:24:20,670 --> 01:24:21,550
什么公司
What company?

964
01:24:21,550 --> 01:24:23,000
莱克斯集团
Lexcorp.

965
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:25,300
莱克斯·卢瑟?
Lex Luthor?

966
01:24:25,590 --> 01:24:28,310
他还在那个沙漠围场安插了他的私人雇佣兵
He also had private security contractors at the desert compound.

967
01:24:32,750 --> 01:24:34,250
公开出来
Go on record.

968
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:37,950
绝不可能 这是机密
Not a chance. It's classified.

969
01:24:38,110 --> 01:24:39,400
我又恰好喜欢我的工作
I happen to like my job.

970
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:40,610
这说不通
It doesn't make sense.

971
01:24:40,610 --> 01:24:42,690
你说那个圈套是为了陷害超人
You said that the ambush was arranged to frame superman,

972
01:24:42,690 --> 01:24:44,820
但他们怎么会知道他会出现在...
but how could they know that he'd show up in the...

973
01:24:51,930 --> 01:24:54,170
那片沙漠中 谢谢
In the middle of the desert. Thank you.

974
01:24:54,910 --> 01:24:56,460
好了 过来
Alright, come on through.

975
01:24:57,470 --> 01:25:01,080
参议院听证会现在随时可能开始
The senate hearing is expected to get underway any minute now.

976
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:03,310
当然 最大的未知数就是
And of course the big unknown in all of this is

977
01:25:03,310 --> 01:25:04,810
超人会出现吗
will superman show up?

978
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:05,970
这是他们真正所期盼的
That is what they're really waiting to see.

979

问你个问题
Quick question for you.

982
01:25:10,150 --> 01:25:11,640
你就要和议员们见面了
You're heading in to meet with the senators.

983
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:13,320
你会跟他们说什么
What will you tell them?

984
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:15,810
我是来告诉他们该醒醒了
I've come here to tell them to wake up.

985
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:18,430
这是血和肉的事实
This is flesh and blood.

986
01:25:18,430 --> 01:25:19,930
他已经带来了一场战争
He has delivered a war here.

987
01:25:19,930 --> 01:25:20,060
<b>韦恩公司前雇员将出庭作证
他已经带来了一场战争

This is what war looks like.

991
01:25:23,940 --> 01:25:24,990
我一无所有了
I have nothing.

992
01:25:24,990 --> 01:25:28,000
先生 有很多人会说他是他们的英雄
There are plenty of people, sir, who would say he's their hero.

993
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,670
他不是英雄
He is not a hero.

994
01:25:29,910 --> 01:25:32,670
格蕾丝 能麻烦你让格雷格上来吗
Grace, can you get Greg up here, please?

995
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:33,740
就现在
Right now.

996
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:37,080
一个匿名线人能证明每一件
An anonymous source can verify everything

997
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:39,250
我跟你所说在内罗米发生的事
I told you about what happened in nairomi.

998
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:41,320
- 一个匿名线人? - 刊登出来
- An anonymous source? Run it.

999
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:43,450
卢瑟策划了沙漠事件
Luthor engineered the desert.

1000
01:25:43,450 --> 01:25:45,620
那是给超人设的圈套
It was an ambush for superman.

1001
01:25:45,620 --> 01:25:47,300
相信你的记者 想想水门事件
Trust your reporter. Think Watergate.

1002
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:49,320
好吧 你得想想打官司的事
Yeah, and you need to think litigate.

1003
01:25:49,330 --> 01:25:51,860
如果你是错的 卢瑟会把报社告到不复存在
If you're wrong, Luthor will sue the paper out of existence.

1004
01:25:51,860 --> 01:25:53,030
你需要证据
You need proof.

1005
01:25:53,030 --> 01:25:54,810
别这样 现在就得刊登出来
No. It needs to run now.

1006
01:25:54,930 --> 01:25:56,230
在听证会之前
Before the hearing.

1007
01:25:56,230 --> 01:25:57,890
如果超人知道了 或许会改变他的说辞
If superman knows, it might change what he says.

1008
01:25:57,890 --> 01:26:00,000
我不会拿报社冒险
I am not going to risk the paper

1009
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,820
好让你在课堂上给你的救命恩人递纸条
so that you can pass notes in class to the man that rescued you.

1010
01:26:03,690 --> 01:26:04,780
他贿赂了她?
He paid her?

1011
01:26:04,780 --> 01:26:07,340
不只是贿赂了她 他还威胁了她
Not only paid her. He threatened her.

1012
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:09,150
并给了她一份稿子熟记
Gave her a script to learn.

1013

她父母在家里活得好好的
Her parents are alive back home.

1014
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:14,520
不过那姑娘良心发现了
But the girl's got a conscience.

1015
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:17,390
- 他一直在把委员会当他的木偶剧院来用 - 议员
- He's been using the committee as his puppet theater. - Senator!

1016
01:26:18,150 --> 01:26:19,550
嗨 你好
Hi, you.

1017
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,500
别走开 我有话跟你说
Don't go anywhere. I want to talk to you.

1018
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:22,920
梅茜 你先进去

帮我占好座位
and make sure no one takes my seat.

1020
01:26:25,090 --> 01:26:26,360
你要干嘛
So what you been up to?

1021
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:27,590
我只是来讲讲我的故事
I'm just here to tell my story.

1022
01:26:27,590 --> 01:26:29,840
那就是我想出资造一件威慑氪星人的武器
That I was willing to finance a Kryptonian deterrent,

1023
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,930
但一位肯塔基的资浅议员
but a certain junior senator from Kentucky

1024
01:26:31,930 --> 01:26:32,760
决定要阻止
decided to block it.

1025
01:26:33,050 --> 01:26:37,070
没错 专议超人的委员会主席在安全问题上很手软
Yes, the chair of the committee on superman is soft on security.

1026
01:26:37,070 --> 01:26:39,940
- 格雷格 为什么他一直没收到我们的支票 - 他收到了 韦恩先生
- Greg, why hasn't he been getting our checks? - He is, Mr. Wayne.

1027
01:26:39,940 --> 01:26:42,410
他每个月都会收到一张受害人基金的支票
He gets a check from the victims fund every month.

1028
01:26:42,410 --> 01:26:43,180
可他都退回了
He returns them.

1029
01:26:43,180 --> 01:26:43,730
<b>布鲁斯·韦恩

1105
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:14,410
韦恩先生

1106
01:33:15,910 --> 01:33:19,780
...就在超人作证的参议院听证会大厅里
...in the senate hearing room where superman was testifying.

1107
01:33:19,780 --> 01:33:22,880
这是一起发生在国会大厦的灾难性事件
This is a catastrophic situation at our nation's capitol.

1108
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:24,510
我们还没得到确切数字
We don't have exact numbers yet,

1109
01:33:24,510 --> 01:33:26,420
不过我可以告诉大家 已有十几个人

1110
01:33:26,420 --> 01:33:28,260
在这场爆炸中死亡

1111

急救人员已抵达现场

1112
01:33:29,530 --> 01:33:31,220
他们仍在救出受害者

1113
01:33:31,220 --> 01:33:32,800
最初 超人也在爆炸后帮忙救出受害者
Now initially, superman was helping bring victims out after the blast

1114
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:35,980

国会警方现在已确认爆炸是由

1120
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:47,610
听证会大厅里的一个爆炸装置造成的

1121
01:33:56,990 --> 01:33:58,830

1124
01:34:57,110 --> 01:34:59,890
国会警方向有线电视新闻网确认了

1125
01:34:59,890 --> 01:35:01,310
引爆炸弹的嫌疑犯是

1129
01:35:03,860 --> 01:35:05,520
克拉克 还是我 你能不能...
Clark, it's me again. Can you...

1130
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:07,990
...可能是把爆炸装置藏在轮椅内
...could have gotten the explosive device into the hearing

1131
01:35:07,990 --> 01:35:10,280
带入听证会的
by concealing them inside his wheelchair.

1132
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:12,160
至于超人 他当时在场
As for superman, he was in the room,

1133
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:13,950
但显然没能阻止他
but obviously failed to stop him.

1134
01:35:13,950 --> 01:35:15,160
我没看见 小露
I didn't see it, lo.

1135
01:35:15,970 --> 01:35:18,030
我就站在那里 却没有看见
I was standing right there and I didn't see it.

1136
01:35:18,030 --> 01:35:19,910
克拉克 这件事有幕后主使
Clark, there are people behind this.

1137
01:35:19,910 --> 01:35:22,080
我没看见 恐怕是因为我就没看过
I'm afraid I didn't see it because I wasn't looking.

1138
01:35:25,370 --> 01:35:26,710
一直以来
All this time,

1139
01:35:27,510 --> 01:35:30,080
我都在按照我父亲的看法活着
I've been living my life the way my father saw it.

1140
01:35:31,210 --> 01:35:32,880
为一个鬼魂纠正错误
Righting wrongs for a ghost.

1141
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:37,550
以为自己来到这里是为了行善
Thinking I'm here to do good.

1142
01:35:41,860 --> 01:35:44,260
超人一直都不是真实的
Superman was never real.

1143
01:35:44,860 --> 01:35:46,960
那只不过是一个堪萨斯农民的梦想
Just the dream of a farmer from Kansas.

1144
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:51,320
对有些人来说 那个农民的梦想就是一切
That farmer's dream is all some people have.

1145
01:35:52,070 --> 01:35:53,830
是给了他们希望的一切
It's all that gives them hope.

1146
01:36:05,210 --> 01:36:07,110
这是有意义的
This means something.

1147
01:36:08,420 --> 01:36:10,300
在我的世界是有过
It did on my world.

1148
01:36:11,350 --> 01:36:13,320
可我的世界已不复存在
My world doesn't exist anymore.

1149
01:37:32,430 --> 01:37:33,590
欢迎

注:借用了希腊神话中伊卡洛斯的故事
你飞得太靠近太阳了
You flew too close to the sun.

1172
01:41:15,220 --> 01:41:17,120
看看你现在
Now look at you.

1173
01:41:18,390 --> 01:41:21,400
警告 此为禁止行为
Advising. Action forbidden.

1174
01:41:21,830 --> 01:41:23,900
氪星议会已颁布相应律法
It has been decreed by the council of Krypton

1175
01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:27,400
禁止任何人给如此面目可憎的
that none will ever again give life to a deformity

1176
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:29,440
畸形体重注生命
so hateful to sight and memory.

1177
01:41:29,990 --> 01:41:32,270
那是无名的亵渎
The desecration without name.

1178
01:41:32,270 --> 01:41:34,640
那氪星议会在哪呢
And where is the council of Krypton?

1179
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:36,780
被毁了 先生
Destroyed, sir.

1180
01:41:37,950 --> 01:41:39,420
那就继续吧
Then proceed.

1181
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:44,480
好的 正在准备生物蛹并开始变形
Very well. Preparing chrysalis and commencing metamorphosis.

1182
01:41:47,020 --> 01:41:48,930
所以我们的疑问是
"And so we are left to wonder

1183
01:41:48,930 --> 01:41:52,230
如果超人注意到了危险而什么都没做
"if superman was aware of the threat and did nothing,

1184
01:41:52,230 --> 01:41:55,400
那他和此次国会大厦的惨剧有关系吗
"was he then complicit in the capitol tragedy?"

1185
01:41:55,980 --> 01:41:56,730
肯特还是没来?
Still no Kent?

1186
01:41:56,730 --> 01:41:58,600
他的消失引起了不少疑问
"His disappearance raises questions."

1187
01:41:59,190 --> 01:41:59,900
没来
No.

1188
01:42:00,020 --> 01:42:02,140
还有很多问题没有得到解答
There are still so many unanswered questions.

1189
01:42:02,140 --> 01:42:04,650
其中最主要的就是超人是否参与了
Chief among them, whether superman was involved

1190
01:42:04,650 --> 01:42:05,990
此次袭击的谋划
in the planning of this attack.

1191
01:42:05,990 --> 01:42:06,190
这是一个有着无限力量的个体
I mean, here's an individual who has unlimited power,

1192
01:42:06,190 --> 01:42:08,610
超人是否参与其中了?
这是一个有着无限力量的个体
I mean, here's an individual who has unlimited power,

1193
01:42:08,610 --> 01:42:09,860
却没去阻止离他只有几英尺的引爆者
yet did nothing to stop the bomber just a few feet away from him.
超人是否参与其中了?

1194
01:42:09,860 --> 01:42:11,610
却没去阻止离他只有几英尺的引爆者
yet did nothing to stop the bomber just a few feet away from him.

1195
01:42:11,610 --> 01:42:14,280
这对调查员们来说 不合情理
It just doesn't add up for investigators.

1196
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:18,580
烧死他 烧死他 烧死他
Burn him, burn him, burn him.

1197
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:43,940
给他20美元 他就当没看见你
For twenty American, he didn't see you.

1198
01:42:44,850 --> 01:42:45,910
我也一样
Same for me.

1199
01:42:51,480 --> 01:42:53,490
他知道这山上不去

1200
01:42:54,310 --> 01:42:56,200
他是来送死的

1201
01:42:57,120 --> 01:43:00,540
援引当前一名熟悉此案的联调局官员
Now one FBI official familiar with this case

1202
01:43:00,540 --> 01:43:02,500
告诉我的原话
told me they found quote,

1203
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:06,130
在基夫公寓里中了个大奖 发现了炸弹制造材料
"a jackpot of bomb-making materials inside keefe's apartment."

1204
01:43:06,130 --> 01:43:07,720
他们现在需要查明的是
What they need to determine now is

1205
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:11,260
他是否在谋划与实行过程中得到了他人的协助
whether he had any help in the planning and execution of the bombing.

1206
01:43:11,260 --> 01:43:13,510
他们尚未排除
And they haven't ruled out the idea

1207
01:43:13,510 --> 01:43:15,890
超人是同谋的可能
that superman was a co-conspirator.

1208
01:43:16,310 --> 01:43:21,190
现在 我的线人们告诉我 他们在此事的调查中收到了
Now, my sources are telling me they are getting a barrage of anonymous and credible tips

1209
01:43:21,190 --> 01:43:23,310
大量匿名而又可靠的线索
with all roads in this investigation

1210
01:43:23,310 --> 01:43:25,980
全都指向了那位氪星来客
leading to the Kryptonian visitor.

1211
01:44:03,050 --> 01:44:05,190
好了 露易丝 你该走了
All right, Lois. You gotta go.

1212
01:44:22,170 --> 01:44:23,770
他并不知道自己会死
He didn't know he was gonna die.

1213
01:44:25,540 --> 01:44:27,040
他还买了不少食物
He just bought groceries.

1214
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:29,460
那个轮椅和沙漠的那颗子弹
The wheelchair and the bullet from the desert

1215
01:44:29,460 --> 01:44:30,670
都由同种金属制成
were made from the same metal.

1216
01:44:31,150 --> 01:44:32,710
我知道 沙漠 听证会
I know. The desert. The hearing.

1217
01:44:32,710 --> 01:44:35,620
卢瑟想要超人所到之处都是死亡
Everywhere superman goes, Luthor wants death.

1218
01:44:35,620 --> 01:44:37,880
但是 卢瑟费了这么大劲
But, Luthor goes through all of that trouble...

1219
01:44:37,890 --> 01:44:39,430
把轮椅做成了一颗炸弹
Creates a bomb out of a wheelchair,

1220
01:44:39,430 --> 01:44:41,220
却又加以改造来降低爆炸威力?
and then alters it to reduce the blast?

1221
01:44:41,220 --> 01:44:43,060
什么意思
What do you mean?

1222
01:44:43,060 --> 01:44:45,690
轮椅内部衬了铅
The inside of the chair was lined with lead.

1223
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:49,830
你没法阻止
You couldn't stop it.

1224
01:44:50,530 --> 01:44:52,100
你也看不见
You couldn't see it.

1225
01:45:34,610 --> 01:45:36,010
不错吧
Something, isn't it?

1226
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:39,850
我们堪萨斯人住在平原
We men of Kansas live on a pancake,

1227
01:45:39,850 --> 01:45:41,450
所以要来山上
so we come to the mountains.

1228
01:45:42,950 --> 01:45:46,750
从这里俯瞰河漫滩
All downhill from here, down to the floodplain.

1229
01:45:46,760 --> 01:45:48,650
农场就像在世界的最底端
Farm at the bottom of the world.

1230
01:45:50,590 --> 01:45:52,960
我记得有一季的洪水很猛
I remember one season the water came bad.

1231
01:45:53,630 --> 01:45:55,560
那时我还不到12岁
I couldn't have been 12.

1232
01:45:55,560 --> 01:45:58,560
我爸拿出了铲子 我们拼命挖了一夜
Dad had out the shovels and we went at it all night.

1233
01:45:58,570 --> 01:46:00,730
一直到我晕了过去
We worked till, i think, I fainted.

1234
01:46:00,740 --> 01:46:02,540
但我们成功阻挡了洪水
But we managed to stop the water.

1235
01:46:03,850 --> 01:46:05,100
我们拯救了农场
We saved the farm.

1236
01:46:06,810 --> 01:46:09,770
你奶奶给我烤了个蛋糕 夸我是英雄
Your grandma baked me a cake. Said I was a hero.

1237
01:46:12,450 --> 01:46:14,180
那天晚些时候 我们发现
Later that day we found out

1238
01:46:15,450 --> 01:46:16,620
我们是挡住了洪水
we blocked the water all right.

1239
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:18,270
可我们把它送回了上游
We sent it upstream.

1240
01:46:19,120 --> 01:46:21,080
朗家的整个农场都被冲走了
The whole lang farm washed away.

1241
01:46:22,660 --> 01:46:25,660
我在吃我的英雄蛋糕时 他们的马被淹了
While I ate my hero cake, their horses were drowning.

1242
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:30,920
我以前常在梦中听见它们的嚎哭
I used to hear them wailing in my sleep.

1243
01:46:34,670 --> 01:46:36,340
这样的噩梦有停止过吗
Did the nightmares ever stop?

1244
01:46:38,940 --> 01:46:39,840
有
Yeah.

1245
01:46:41,310 --> 01:46:42,600
当我遇到你的母亲时
When I met your mother.

1246
01:46:45,250 --> 01:46:48,080
她让我相信这世界上还有美好存在
She gave me faith that there's good in this world.

1247
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:51,810
她就是我的世界
She was my world.

1248
01:46:55,490 --> 01:46:56,740
我想你 儿子
I miss you, son.

1249
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:03,580
我也想你 爸爸
I miss you too, dad.

1250
01:47:23,850 --> 01:47:25,280
你知道你赢不了的
You know you can't win this.

1251
01:47:27,190 --> 01:47:28,520
这是自杀
It's suicide.

1252
01:47:31,530 --> 01:47:34,590
我现在比我父亲死时的年纪还大
I'm older now than my father ever was.

1253
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:40,110
或许这对我是唯一有意义的事
This may be the only thing i do that matters.

1254
01:47:40,700 --> 01:47:44,640
打击犯罪二十年 毫无意义吗
20 years of fighting criminals amounts to nothing?

1255
01:47:44,640 --> 01:47:46,660
犯罪就像野草 阿尔弗雷德
Criminals are like weeds, Alfred.

1256
01:47:47,380 --> 01:47:49,780
除掉一个 又会在原地长出另一个
Pull one up, another grows in its place.

1257
01:47:51,850 --> 01:47:54,050
这关乎世界的未来
This is about the future of the world.

1258
01:47:55,820 --> 01:47:57,450
这是我的遗赠
This is my legacy.

1259
01:47:58,690 --> 01:48:01,050
我父亲曾让我坐在这里
My father sat me down right here.

1260
01:48:01,060 --> 01:48:03,220
告诉我韦恩家族是靠什么兴起的
Told me what Wayne manor was built on.

1261
01:48:03,220 --> 01:48:06,730
铁路 房地产 还有石油
Railroads, real estates, and oil.

1262
01:48:06,730 --> 01:48:10,400
第一代和法国人做生意大赚了一笔
The first generation made their fortune trading with the French.

1263
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:12,100
毛皮生意
Pelts and skins.

1264
01:48:15,900 --> 01:48:17,070
他们都是猎人
They were hunters.

1265
01:48:34,020 --> 01:48:36,840
所以韦恩家族会陨落
So falls the house of Wayne.

1266
01:48:37,790 --> 01:48:39,590
我们得等待更多证据
We gotta wait for more evidence,

1267
01:48:39,590 --> 01:48:41,560
但问题还在
but the question still remains,

1268
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:42,680
他在哪
where is he?

1269
01:48:43,430 --> 01:48:45,770
如果超人没有参与其中
If superman was not involved,

1270
01:48:45,770 --> 01:48:49,140
如果他光明磊落 那为何自惨剧发生的那天起
if he's got nothing to hide, then why hasn't he been seen

1271
01:48:49,140 --> 01:48:51,140
一直没看到他现身
since the day of this tragedy?

1272
01:48:51,140 --> 01:48:52,270
你不能就这么指向...
You can't point a finger and...

1273
01:48:52,270 --> 01:48:55,040
我什么都没指 沃伦 十根手指在这呢 看见没
I'm not pointing anything, Warren. Look. Ten fingers, see?

1274
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:56,710
如果有罪犯...
If there is going to be a criminal...

1275
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:26,650
黑夜已至
The night is here.

1276
01:50:58,100 --> 01:50:59,160
打扰下
Excuse me.

1277
01:51:01,370 --> 01:51:02,600
我是不是见过...
Don't I know...

1278
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:09,340
注:改自小说《洛丽塔》中的句子
早晨就叫小露 穿便服时就叫露拉
Plain lo in the morning. Lola in slacks.

1279
01:52:10,570 --> 01:52:11,700
露易丝·莱恩
Lois Lane.

1280
01:52:13,980 --> 01:52:15,180
来看看风景
Mmm. Come see the view.

1281
01:52:18,310 --> 01:52:20,510
高度的秘诀
Now the secret to the height

1282
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:22,820
在于建筑材料
is the building material.

1283
01:52:22,820 --> 01:52:26,320
这里用的是轻金属 所以在风中有点晃
It's light metals which sway a bit in the wind.

1284
01:52:30,990 --> 01:52:33,700
你对莱克斯集团的金属也有些了解 对吧 莱恩小姐
And you know something about lexcorp metals, don't you, miss Lane?

1285
01:52:34,330 --> 01:52:36,200
我已经查实了你的所作所为
I've proven what you've done.

1286
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:37,580
你还真能折腾
Wow, you're feisty.

1287
01:52:38,300 --> 01:52:40,330
可惜 那一切都将随风而逝
Unfortunately, that will blow away.

1288
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:42,840
就如沙漠中的沙子
Like sand in the desert.

1289
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:43,970
你是个疯子
You're psychotic.

1290
01:52:43,970 --> 01:52:45,440
狭隘的头脑都是用
That is a three-syllable word

1291
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:47,970
这个词来描述伟大创想的
for any thought too big for little minds.

1292
01:52:48,250 --> 01:52:50,300
下个话题 圈圈
Hmm. Next category: Circles.

1293
01:52:50,780 --> 01:52:55,550
他们找超人找了一圈一圈又一圈
Round and round and round they go to find superman.

1294
01:52:55,550 --> 01:52:57,680
搞错话题了 少年 应该是三角形
Wrong category, boy. No, no, triangles.

1295
01:52:57,690 --> 01:52:59,290
没错 欧几里得的三角不等式
Yes, euclid's triangle inequality.

1296
01:52:59,290 --> 01:53:01,490
任意两点之间的最短距离
The shortest distance between any two points

1297
01:53:01,490 --> 01:53:02,640
是直线
is a straight path.

1298
01:53:03,290 --> 01:53:06,230
我相信通向超人最直的线
And I believe the straightest path to superman

1299
01:53:06,230 --> 01:53:07,730
是一条非常小的路...
is a pretty little road...

1300
01:53:08,690 --> 01:53:10,160
叫露易丝·莱恩
Called Lois Lane.

1301
01:53:32,690 --> 01:53:34,120
你回来了
You came back.

1302
01:53:34,990 --> 01:53:36,320
你回来了
You came back.

1303
01:53:55,580 --> 01:53:57,780
天啊 这里有不少问题啊
Boy, do we have problems up here!

1304
01:54:01,060 --> 01:54:01,850
关于...
The...

1305
01:54:01,850 --> 01:54:04,750
关于世间邪恶的问题
The problem of... Of evil in the world.

1306
01:54:05,330 --> 01:54:06,950
关于至善的问题
The problem of absolute virtue.

1307
01:54:06,950 --> 01:54:09,120
我不会打残你 但我要把你收监
I'll take you in without breaking you.

1308
01:54:09,120 --> 01:54:10,500
这更是你应得的
Which is more than you deserve.

1309
01:54:10,500 --> 01:54:13,390
关于你高高在上的问题
The problem of you on top of everything else.

1310
01:54:13,390 --> 01:54:15,090
你凌驾于一切之上
You above all.

1311
01:54:15,100 --> 01:54:16,880
因为神就是这样
Ah, because that's what god is.

1312
01:54:17,600 --> 01:54:21,670
荷鲁斯 阿波罗 耶和华 卡尔·艾尔
Horus. Apollo. Jehovah. Kal- El.

1313
01:54:22,970 --> 01:54:25,970
克拉克·约瑟夫·肯特
Clark Joseph Kent.

1314
01:54:27,740 --> 01:54:31,570
瞧 克拉克·乔 我们对神的称呼取决于我们的部族
See, what we call god depends upon our tribe, Clark-Joe.

1315
01:54:31,950 --> 01:54:35,080
因为神也分部族 神也选立场
Because god is tribal. God takes sides.

1316
01:54:35,080 --> 01:54:37,080
我小时候 天上可没人来干涉
No man in the sky intervened when I was a boy

1317
01:54:37,080 --> 01:54:40,120
我爸的拳头和憎恶 将我从中解救
to deliver me from daddy's fist and abominations. Mmm.

1318
01:54:40,120 --> 01:54:43,920
我早就明白了 如果神是全能的
I figured out way back, if god is all-powerful,

1319
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:45,360
那他就不可能至善至美
he cannot be all-good.

1320
01:54:47,060 --> 01:54:48,630
如果他至善至美
And if he is all-good,

1321
01:54:48,630 --> 01:54:50,540
那他就不可能全能
then he cannot be all-powerful.

1322
01:54:50,970 --> 01:54:52,380
而这两者 你都不可能
And neither can you be.

1323
01:54:53,250 --> 01:54:55,260
他们需要亲眼看到
They need to see the fraud you are.

1324
01:54:56,400 --> 01:54:57,700
你的假象
With their eyes.

1325
01:54:58,970 --> 01:55:01,840
你手上的鲜血
The blood on your hands.

1326
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:03,010
你干了什么
What have you done?

1327
01:55:03,260 --> 01:55:04,910
今晚他们就会看到
And tonight, they will.

1328
01:55:04,910 --> 01:55:08,270
没错 我的朋友 因为你要去赴约
Yes. Because you, my friend, have a date.

1329
01:55:09,080 --> 01:55:10,580
要飞越海湾
Across the bay.

1330
01:55:10,690 --> 01:55:13,190
他积聚了两年的恨意 是时候爆发了
Ripe fruit, his hate. Two years growing.

1331
01:55:13,190 --> 01:55:15,190
不过逼他爆发 倒没怎么费力
But it did not take much to push him over, actually.

1332
01:55:15,190 --> 01:55:16,650
小红字 大爆炸
Little red notes, big bang.

1333
01:55:16,650 --> 01:55:17,950
你害死了你的家人
You let your family die!

1334
01:55:19,490 --> 01:55:21,950
现在你要飞到他那里
And now you will fly to him.

1335
01:55:23,370 --> 01:55:24,830
与他一战
And you will battle him.

1336
01:55:25,490 --> 01:55:26,410
至死方休
To the death.

1337
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:31,040
黑与蓝 对决之夜
Black and blue. Fight night!

1338
01:55:31,580 --> 01:55:34,540
史上最伟大的角斗士对决
The greatest gladiator match in the history of the world.

1339
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:36,460
天神对凡人
God versus man.

1340
01:55:37,380 --> 01:55:38,880
白昼对黑夜
Day versus night.

1341
01:55:40,280 --> 01:55:43,350
氪星之子对哥谭蝙蝠
Son of Krypton versus bat of Gotham.

1342
01:55:43,350 --> 01:55:45,620
你觉得我会为了你 而与他一战?
You think I'll fight him for you?

1343
01:55:46,140 --> 01:55:48,390
没错 我认为你会为了你生命中的
Yes, I do. I think you will fight-fight-fight

1344
01:55:48,390 --> 01:55:50,360
那位女神战斗 战斗 战斗
for that special lady in your life.

1345
01:55:50,360 --> 01:55:52,660
她在地面很安全 而你呢
She's safe on the ground. How about you?

1346
01:55:52,940 --> 01:55:55,400
差点说对 但我说的不是露易丝
Close, but I am not talking about Lois.

1347
01:55:56,300 --> 01:56:00,200
不是她 每个男孩的女神都是他的母亲
No. Every boy's special lady is his mother.

1348
01:56:03,490 --> 01:56:04,120
女巫

1349
01:56:05,530 --> 01:56:06,370
女巫

1350
01:56:06,370 --> 01:56:06,690
玛莎 玛莎 玛莎
Martha, Martha, Martha.
女巫

1351
01:56:06,690 --> 01:56:08,120
玛莎 玛莎 玛莎
Martha, Martha, Martha.

1352
01:56:10,850 --> 01:56:13,630
飞天恶魔的母亲一定是个女巫
Why, the mother of a flying demon must be a witch.

1353
01:56:14,820 --> 01:56:17,050
对女巫的刑罚 是什么来着
The punishment for witches, what is that?

1354
01:56:17,690 --> 01:56:19,820
没错 被火烧死
That's right. Death by fire.

1355
01:56:30,180 --> 01:56:31,430
她在哪
Where is she?

1356
01:56:31,430 --> 01:56:33,230
我不知道 我不会让他们告诉我
I don't know! I would not let them tell me!

1357
01:56:34,150 --> 01:56:35,730
你要是杀了我 玛莎就会死
If you kill me, Martha dies.

1358
01:56:35,740 --> 01:56:37,900

我给了那蝙蝠一战的机会

但他不够强

冲击波越来越强了

卡尔文 你在说什么

韦恩老爷 听得到吗

它是氪星生物

只有氪石武器才能杀死它

落在哥谭了

理论上是这样

1615
02:29:39,550 --> 02:29:42,350
我得引它追着我回到哥谭

这个港口已经被废弃了

1625
02:32:06,990 --> 02:32:08,060
我的世界

我爱你
I love you.

1634
02:37:03,490 --> 02:37:06,910
不行 不行 克拉克 你不能去

1635
02:37:08,670 --> 02:37:10,080
这里是我的世界
This is my world.

1636
02:37:10,600 --> 02:37:12,070
不行 克拉克 别去
No, Clark, don't.

1637
02:37:15,670 --> 02:37:17,630
你就是我的世界
You are my world.

1638
02:37:18,040 --> 02:37:18,970
不行
No.

1639
02:37:22,350 --> 02:37:24,080
求你了 克拉克
Please. Clark!

"For thy dew is like the dew of morning.

我需要搭车回家一趟
I need a ride back to the house.

1656
02:47:44,340 --> 02:47:45,880

1657
02:47:46,470 --> 02:47:47,540
谁付的
By whom?

1658
02:47:48,470 --> 02:47:49,760
匿名捐赠者
Anonymous donor.

1659
02:48:34,020 --> 02:48:37,270
东边的那些表演只是在下葬一副空棺材
All those circuses back east burying an empty box.

1660
02:48:38,190 --> 02:48:39,860
他们不知道如何缅怀他
They don't know how to honor him,

1661
02:48:41,290 --> 02:48:43,090
只能当做军人
except as a soldier.

1662
02:48:44,860 --> 02:48:45,930
他活着时
I've failed him

1663
02:48:46,810 --> 02:48:47,850
我辜负了他
in life.

1664
02:48:49,670 --> 02:48:51,530
他死后 我不会再辜负他
I won't fail him in death.

1665
02:48:53,470 --> 02:48:55,330
帮我找到其他像你这样的人
Help me find the others like you.

1666
02:48:56,140 --> 02:48:58,070
也许他们不希望被找到
Perhaps they don't want to be found.

1667
02:48:59,010 --> 02:49:01,810
他们会的 他们还要战斗
They will. And they'll fight.

1668
02:49:03,010 --> 02:49:04,550
我们必须联手
We have to stand together.

1669
02:49:12,720 --> 02:49:15,640
一百年前 我离开了人类
100 years ago, I walked away from mankind.

1670
02:49:18,030 --> 02:49:20,000
远离了一个世纪的恐怖万象
From a century of horrors.

1671
02:49:23,570 --> 02:49:27,030
人类创造了一个不可能联手的世界
Man made a world where standing together is impossible.

1672
02:49:30,340 --> 02:49:32,270
人类依然优秀
Men are still good.

1673
02:49:34,740 --> 02:49:37,650
我们争斗 厮杀
We fight. We kill.

1674
02:49:38,850 --> 02:49:40,670
我们相互背叛
We betray one another.

1675
02:49:43,120 --> 02:49:45,050
但我们能重整旗鼓
But we can rebuild.

1676
02:49:46,420 --> 02:49:48,090
我们能做得更好
We can do better.

1677
02:49:49,560 --> 02:49:50,430
我们会的
We will.

1678
02:49:51,600 --> 02:49:52,800
我们必须如此
We have to.

1679
02:50:10,060 --> 02:50:14,530
如果你在寻找他的丰碑
看看你的周围吧

1680
02:50:15,890 --> 02:50:17,450
其他像我一样的人
The others like me.

1681
02:50:17,460 --> 02:50:19,500
为什么你说他们必须战斗
Why did you say they'll have to fight?

1682
02:50:25,130 --> 02:50:26,500
只是一种感觉
Just a feeling.

1683
02:50:38,580 --> 02:50:41,180
囚犯 A-C-23-19-40
Prisoner A-C-23-19-40.

1684
02:50:41,180 --> 02:50:43,400
监狱长想跟你谈话 站起来
The warden wants to speak to you, so stand to your feet.

1685
02:50:45,520 --> 02:50:47,420
我再说一遍
I'm gonna say this one more time.

1686
02:50:47,420 --> 02:50:50,220
监狱长想跟你谈话 站起来
The warden wants to speak to you, so stand to your feet.

1687
02:50:58,090 --> 02:50:59,620
转过身 面朝墙
Turn around and face the wall.

1688
02:51:02,030 --> 02:51:03,870
前额靠住墙
Place your forehead against the wall.

1689
02:51:04,440 --> 02:51:06,000
双手放背后
Put your hands behind your back,

1690
02:51:06,340 --> 02:51:07,920
我进来好铐住你
so that I can come in and restrain you.

1691
02:51:36,700 --> 02:51:39,640
无论你做什么 无论你去哪里
Whatever you do, wherever you go,

1692
02:51:39,640 --> 02:51:41,200
我都会盯着你
I'll be watching you.

1693
02:51:45,210 --> 02:51:46,210
看看我们啊
Look at us.

1694
02:51:47,880 --> 02:51:50,000
一切就是这样分崩离析的
This is how it all caves in.

1695
02:51:50,180 --> 02:51:55,580
韦恩庄园的文明被丢弃了
Civilization on the Wayne manor's out the window.

1696
02:51:59,660 --> 02:52:02,560
但是谁会相信我呢 我...
But who would believe me? I...

1697
02:52:02,560 --> 02:52:04,990
我疯了
I'm insane.

1698
02:52:06,260 --> 02:52:08,150
我都没法受审
I'm not even fit to stand trial.

1699
02:52:08,430 --> 02:52:09,570
没错
That's right.

1700
02:52:10,370 --> 02:52:14,200
悉心照料精神病患者的医院有不少
We have hospitals that treat the mentally ill with compassion.

1701
02:52:15,510 --> 02:52:17,030
但那里不是你要去的地方
But that's not where you're going.

1702
02:52:17,510 --> 02:52:21,010
我已给你安排好转去哥谭的阿卡姆疯人院
I arranged for you to get transferred to arkham asylum in Gotham.

1703
02:52:22,410 --> 02:52:24,080
我在那里还有些朋友
I still have some friends there.

1704
02:52:24,950 --> 02:52:26,580
他们在等着你
They're expecting you.

1705
02:52:31,090 --> 02:52:35,320
但钟声已被敲响
But the bell's already been rung.

1706
02:52:37,790 --> 02:52:39,260
他们已经听到了
And they've heard it.

1707
02:52:41,100 --> 02:52:42,430
在黑暗之中
Out in the dark.

1708
02:52:42,870 --> 02:52:44,600
在群星之间
Among the stars.

1709

1710

但钟声是收不回的
But a bell cannot be unrung!

1711
02:53:05,660 --> 02:53:06,790
他饿了
He's hungry.

1712
02:53:07,790 --> 02:53:09,420
他找到我们了
He's found us.

1713
02:53:10,390 --> 02:53:11,840
他要来了
And he's coming!
