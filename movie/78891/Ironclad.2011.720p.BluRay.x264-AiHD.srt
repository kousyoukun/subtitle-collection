1
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,625
英格兰，公元1215年，
England, in the year 1215,

2
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:57,542
约翰王在位已经十六年
had been under the reign of King John for 16 years.

3
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,625
作为英格兰有史以来最恶毒的统治者，
The most villainous of England's monarchs,

4
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:05,167
战败给法国而闻名的约翰王，
John was renowned for losing wars with France,

5
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,000
横征暴敛，
levying punitive taxes,

6
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:10,708
奸淫无度
and sleeping with the wives of barons.

7
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:15,917
贵族们被迫反抗他们的约翰王了
The barons finally rebelled against their king,

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,250
注定要爆发一场血腥的内战
and became locked in a bloody civil war

9
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:23,625
内战持续了三年多，双方的战力都遭到了重创
lasting for over three years and decimating both armies.

10
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:28,917
期间，圣殿骑士团也被卷入了这场冲突之中
In time, the Knights Templar were drawn into this conflict.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,375
在这些训练有素的圣殿骑士的帮助下，
With the help of these highly trained warrior monks,

12
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:36,833
约翰王和他的军队被彻底地打败了
King John and his royal army were eventually defeated.

13
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:41,833
约翰王想保住他的王位，
It was agreed that John could remain on the throne,

14
00:01:41,917 --> 00:01:44,375
一个先决条件...
on one condition...

15
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:46,667
那就是签署一个宪章
that he would sign a document

16
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,875
赋予平民享受自由的权利
upholding the rights and privileges of all free men,

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,958
同时抑制王权
but ultimately limiting the power of the monarchy.

18
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:57,917
签字生效！
Make it count.

19
00:01:59,042 --> 00:02:02,375
约翰在温莎堡附近的伦尼米德签署《大宪章》
The Magna Carta was sealed at Runnymede

20
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:07,583
时间是公元1215年6月15日
on the 15th of June in the year of our Lord 1215.

21
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:10,875
《大宪章》事件将被载入史册
It will be remembered throughout history.

22
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:15,458
但世人忘却的是宪章签署后发生的事
(本片故事改编自英国历史上伟大的罗切斯特城堡保卫战)
What is not remembered is what King John did next.

23
00:02:43,292 --> 00:02:45,250
陛下?
Sire?

24
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,292
陛下?
Sire?

25
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,833
到时间了。
It's time.

26
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,792
(英格兰南部海岸)
Hyah!

27
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,500
(丹麦雇佣军集结中)
Hyah! Hyah!

28
00:03:58,292 --> 00:04:00,792
英格兰欢迎你
England welcomes you.

29
00:04:00,917 --> 00:04:02,500
教皇信守承诺？
Does the Pope hold his word?

30
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:08,458
噢，要有信心啊，泰伯瑞斯队长
Oh, how have faith, Captain Tiberius.

31
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:12,250
他在等你按约定行动的消息呢
His Eminence is waiting to hear you hold to yours.

32
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:16,292
他承诺过教会会保障你的权益
The Church will stay out of your lands, you have his word.

33
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,125
那我们将帮你重新掌控这个国家
We'll get your country back.

34
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:51,667
来者何人？
What say you?

35
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,208
我叫埃伯特-马修斯. 我们来躲避暴风雪
Abbot Marcus. We seek shelter from the storm.

36
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:03,125
开打城门！
Open the gates!

37
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,625
快来帮忙
Come and help.

38
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,583
你跑这里来有事吗？
What business do you have here?

39
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,917
我的任务是去坎特伯雷处理教会事务。我们只是来躲雨
Our business is with God at Canterbury. We need only shelter.

40
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,458
当然可以来躲雨，还有美食
Shelter you shall have. Food also.

41
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:42,375
你对待天主的仆人太周到了
You treat the Lord's servants well.

42
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:45,958
你带着的圣殿骑士团徽章，可你没有佩剑
You wear the mark of the Templars, yet you carry no swords.

43
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:47,792
这些人不再需要打仗了
These men have no more need to fight.

44
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:51,833
圣殿骑士团不佩剑就心怀信念到处走？
Templars masking their faith and travelling without swords.

45
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:53,125
好高尚啊！
How noble!

46
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:56,417
老天爷作证，男爵，这些人光明正大
As God is our witness, Baron, these men have nothing to hide.

47
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,250
埃伯特，别自欺欺人了，骑士团曾经与国王为敌
Abbot, save your benedictions. The Templars fought against the King.

48
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:04,500
现在你睡在国王的城堡里。这些人需要隐藏的东西可多着呢
Now you sleep in a king's castle. These men have plenty to hide.

49
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,375
那个你。你说呢？
You there. What say you?

50
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,375
他们没啥可说的。他们保持沉默誓言
They say nothing. They hold vows of silence.

51
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,375
沉默的骑士团。很好
Templars without tongues. Very well.

52
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,833
明早就离开
Just be gone by the morning.

53
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:26,750
往里退！
Back inside!

54
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,417
马歇尔
Marshal.

55
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,250
当我接受监护那些宣誓沉默的人
When I accept guardianship over men who take the vows of silence,

56
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:45,625
首先他们会告诉我是什么让他们来找我
I'm also informed of what led them to me in the first place.

57
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:48,708
我了解圣殿骑士团把沉重的负担交给了你
I know the Templars placed a heavy burden on you.

58
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,542
我知道你疤痕累累
I know you're deeply scarred.

59
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,083
你罩衫上的十字架
The cross on your tunic

60
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:57,125
是神的意愿下你的信念的象征
is a symbol of your faith in God's will.

61
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:01,417
你现在感到迷茫
It should not be full of the torment it now bears upon your soul.

62
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:04,625
我们到达坎特伯雷之时，
When we arrive at Canterbury,

63
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:09,042
我会讨论你从圣殿骑士团退役的事情
I'm requesting your leave from the Order of the Knights Templar.

64
00:07:57,292 --> 00:08:00,958
守备！
Garrison men!

65
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:04,167
约翰王
King John!

66
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,000
大家，去大门那！国王来了！
Men, to the gates! It's the King!

67
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,208
给国王开门！
Open the gates for the King!

68
00:08:14,792 --> 00:08:16,375
Psst!

69
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:25,542
马歇尔, 你见过皇家的彩旗？
Marshal, did you see royal colours?

70
00:08:55,417 --> 00:08:57,875
达尔奈，那是你的亲手签的吧？
Is that your hand, Darnay?

71
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,208
被逼的，殿下
Forced, Your Highness.

72
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:04,583
贵族们要挟我，逼迫我签字背叛你
The barons threatened my life, forcing me to sign it and betray you.

73
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,583
我了解这个感受
I know the feeling.

74
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:09,417
吊死他！
Hang him!

75
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,458
必须制止这种疯狂行为
This insanity must cease.

76
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:17,208
开门。我们不能坐视不管
Open the door. His quarrel is not with us.

77
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:20,583
如果国王看到你们仨，必死无疑！
If you three stand before the King, there will be nothing but death.

78
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:42,292
达尔奈，你太多幸运啊。看来你还不能马上死
What good fortune, Darnay. It seems you will have your last rites.

79
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,750
我主，圣殿骑士团
My Lord, Templars.

80
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:47,375
他和圣殿骑士团一起前往坎特伯雷
He's travelling en route to Canterbury with Templars.

81
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:54,292
我怎么有幸让教会的人光临我的城堡了？
To what do I owe the pleasure of the Church visiting my castle?

82
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:58,583
陛下，我们来躲雨。达尔奈男爵热情地接待了我们
We were in the storm, sire. Baron Darnay granted us your hospitality.

83
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:00,500
- 我们？      - 我随行的牧师
- We?         - My fellow priests.

84
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,958
啊，对，我听到了
Ah, yes, I heard.

85
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:04,292
圣殿骑士团
Templars.

86
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:08,458
陛下，我们作为非武装人员来你的城堡。不是来找茬
Sire, we entered your castle as unarmed men. We seek no fight.

87
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:11,292
埃伯特,你还记不记得
Are you aware, Abbot,

88
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:14,750
你在伦尼米德逼迫我签字的事？
that your kind stood at Runnymede and forced my signature,

89
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,667
现在你却还在大言不惭
and now you sleep under my roof?

90
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,000
殿下，我们只是赶往坎特伯雷
Your Highness, we travel to Canterbury

91
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,458
毫无恶意
with simple articles of faith.

92
00:10:22,542 --> 00:10:24,917
我请求你大发慈悲让我们通过
I ask your mercy that we may pass.

93
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:27,667
那我会大发慈悲的
And I will grant you the same mercy

94
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:31,167
和当初教会与贵族“大发慈悲”对待我一样
that the Church and the barons of this country bestowed unto me.

95
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,958
"以其人之道, 还治其人之身"，不对吗？Abbot
"Do unto others", isn't that right, Abbot?

96
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,917
泰伯瑞斯
Tiberius!

97
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,333
别让他溜走了
Don't let him go!

98
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:23,833
快跑！
Ride!

99
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,833
牺牲
There is worth...

100
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,708
总存在它的价值
..in every death.

101
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:43,417
现在我会继承你的遗愿
And I will see it now in yours.

102
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,208
- 你见到国王了？       - 对，他也见过我了。
- You saw the King?    - Yes. And he saw me.

103
00:14:26,292 --> 00:14:27,417
Mm.

104
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:33,042
没想到他竟然这么残暴
I didn't imagine that even he was capable of such cruelty.

105
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,208
埃伯特-马修斯是好样的
Abbot Marcus was the finest of men.

106
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:41,083
告诉我，他为什么要考虑你退役的事？
Tell me, why did he request that you leave the Order?

107
00:14:41,167 --> 00:14:45,042
- 我并没想退役                                 - 你答非所问
- Your Grace, I did not wish to be dismissed.  - But that's not what I asked.

108
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,792
我们曾在圣光照耀的土地上？
You were in the Holy Lands?

109
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:52,625
哈，某些人回来保卫我们的信念
Hm. Some men have returned from defending our faith

110
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:55,083
只是为了解开他们心中的疑惑
only to find themselves questioning it.

111
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,792
现在你扪心自问，托马斯
Now you must ask yourself, Thomas.

112
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,958
在你心中的...
what is in your heart?

113
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,583
是起义抑或复仇？
Rebellion or revenge.

114
00:15:05,792 --> 00:15:09,042
我觉得这个和国王的所做所为没什么不同
I suppose it makes no difference as the King has the devil in his.

115
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:12,958
我不管他有没有和教皇说了什么！现在我得去见他
I don't care if he's talking to the Pope! I have to see him now!

116
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:14,667
当我们说到那个浑蛋...
And as we speak of the devil...

117
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,250
尊敬的大主教
My Lord Archbishop.

118
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:22,125
我听说了达尔奈男爵的事情
They told me about Darnay.

119
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,292
我们曾经和约翰王达成妥协
We took John at his word...

120
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:27,000
但现在他又扩建了军队
and now he raises a bitch's army with God's teeth.

121
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,417
我不会向看到血就尿裤子的国王屈服
I'll bow to no king with piss for blood!

122
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,958
这位是托马斯-马歇尔,    这位是威廉de奥尔巴尼男爵
Baron William de Albany, Brother Thomas Marshal.

123
00:15:32,042 --> 00:15:34,750
托马斯直接从达尔奈领地过来的
Brother Thomas comes directly from Darnay Castle.

124
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:39,083
你要原谅男爵，他说话从来都糙了点
You must forgive our Baron, his tongue is not always so profane.

125
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:44,667
现在，你该知道罗马教廷支持国王
Now, you should know that Rome sides with the King.

126
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:50,083
教皇赞成国王对埃伯特-马修斯所做的事？
And the Pope would bless what the King did to Abbot Marcus?

127
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:51,292
或多或少吧
More or less.

128
00:15:53,542 --> 00:15:57,292
《大宪章》的事我会和教廷沟通下
I am to be excommunicated for writing Magna Carta.

129
00:15:57,417 --> 00:15:59,875
- 多久时间我们才能知道教皇的意见？   - 天知道
- How long have we got?              - God knows.

130
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,833
这...
Your Grace, this...

131
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,625
..国王...必须被制止
..king...must be stopped.

132
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:12,125
我无法要求你作战，托马斯
I cannot, in all honesty, ask you to fight, Thomas,

133
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:17,083
但如果你选择拿起剑，将得到我的祝福
but if you choose to take up your sword, you have my blessing.

134
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,625
好兆头
It's a good omen.

135
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:01,292
上帝与我们同在
God is with us.

136
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:05,167
法国路易王子的军队有可能会加入我们
Prince Louis has an army may be persuaded to join us.

137
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,500
找法国人帮忙...
Asking the French for help...

138
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,458
对付邪恶的人
that's cursing the blind for the wicked.

139
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:15,083
如果约翰王走了通往伦敦的多佛大道
If John takes the Dover Road to London

140
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:19,292
他不得不从中路越过罗彻斯特城堡
he has to cross the Medway here at Rochester.

141
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:21,750
我会夺取罗彻斯特城堡
I'll seize Rochester Castle.

142
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,083
拖住他们。为你和法国人的谈判赢得点时间
Delay them. That'll give you time to negotiate with the French.

143
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:29,042
我们没有军队对抗国王
We have no force to fight the King.

144
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:32,167
我能想办法召集一些人
I have a few men I can count on.

145
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:36,250
绝不行！以卵击石这样的自杀式的办法不行，男爵
Absolutely not. Suicide is a sin in the eyes of the Church, Baron.

146
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:40,750
我眼前只有一件事
Your Grace, I'm afraid I only see one thing.

147
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:45,792
从罗彻斯特，国王能调遣军队和物资
From Rochester, the King is able to dispatch his troops and supplies

148
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,958
全国各地汇聚的
all over the country.

149
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:53,875
这个是他的基石。不夺取该城堡我们无法阻止他
It is his keystone. Without it we will not stop him.

150
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,792
我不入地狱谁入地狱
All my sins to this.

151
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,208
但愿上帝庇佑我们的计划
May God protect what we are about to do.

152
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,458
小伙子
Guy!

153
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:46,667
护卫!
Squire!

154
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,458
你们都回去
I want you to ride back.

155
00:18:53,542 --> 00:18:55,417
不，我要去打仗
No. I know how to fight.

156
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,875
你看到他如何和我说话的?
You see how he talks to me?

157
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,875
有杀过人吗？护卫。嗯？
Have you ever killed a man, Squire? Eh?

158
00:19:04,792 --> 00:19:09,500
- 这并不是闹着玩的                              - 为了自由而战不值得吗？
- Then you will learn, it is not a noble thing. - Not even when it's for freedom?

159
00:19:10,542 --> 00:19:12,292
即便为上帝而杀人也不是君子之行
Not even when it is for God.

160
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,500
驾！
Hah!

161
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,458
看你！
Look at you!

162
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:06,375
我不会放过你们任何一个人
Any one of you throws a turd or a bean, I'll get you!

163
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,000
即使变成鬼
And you know I will! Yargh!

164
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,708
- 刽子手呢？                    - 那边
- Where's the butchers?         - Over there.

165
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,167
我会记住你们
I'll remember your faces!

166
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:19,917
羊毛剪！锋利！锋利的羊毛剪
Sheep shears! They're sharp! Sharp sheep shears!

167
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,708
- 找丹尼尔-马科斯                 - 稍等
- I'm looking for Daniel Marks.   - Wait here.

168
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:25,792
马科斯
Marks!

169
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:32,667
不知道如何说了...
Whatever it is or how much...

170
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:38,375
- 带我走吧，男爵                   - 行。拉西呢？
- just get me out of here, Baron.  - Done. Where's de Lacy?

171
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,833
- 他早回泊意图了                  - 贝克特？
- He went back to Poitou.         - Becket?

172
00:20:40,917 --> 00:20:43,042
你不会招他的
You don't want him.

173
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,708
圣殿骑士团已经回来了
Templars. They've come back.

174
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:58,083
这边。保持戒备
Here. You may need protection.

175
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,417
起床
Get up.

176
00:21:16,417 --> 00:21:19,000
给我起床
I said, get up!

177
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,208
你个混蛋
You sack of shit!

178
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,500
Billy.

179
00:21:25,792 --> 00:21:27,542
找我做什么？
What told me I'd see you?

180
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:31,792
比利又帮上帝干活了？
What's with the altar boy? Billy all tied up with God again?

181
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:37,958
- 他和我们不是一类人             - 怒了！
- This is not our man.           - Hoy!

182
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:42,042
我会追随他，别担心这些
I'm his man, don't you worry about that.

183
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:46,750
我为钱啥都敢做
If he pays me enough, I'll split the gut of any man alive.

184
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,583
这不就对了? 比利小子
Ain't that right, Billy boy?

185
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:05,333
- 谁跟随你？                  - 希尔-贝克特. 丹尼尔-马科斯
- Who's with you?             - Gil Becket. Daniel Marks.

186
00:22:05,417 --> 00:22:08,792
上次我们在一起还是在第埃普呢
The last time we were all together must have been Dieppe.

187
00:22:08,917 --> 00:22:10,875
那时候国王对咱们还不错
The days when the King was still good to us.

188
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:13,167
他已经占领了沿海的所有城堡
He's taken all the castles along the coast.

189
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,375
如果他占领了罗彻斯特，他就控制了英格兰南方
If he takes Rochester, he'll control southern England.

190
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:20,417
如果我得到的消息没错的话，他现在太强大了
If the whispers I've heard are true, he's too strong now.

191
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:24,083
他有一支丹麦雇佣军
He's got an army of Danish mercenaries.

192
00:22:24,167 --> 00:22:26,000
还是在伦敦恭候他吧
Wait for him in London.

193
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:30,833
你认为我要这些？我不是个战士，不再是了
Do you think I want this? I'm not a soldier, not any more.

194
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:34,750
我是个有糟糠之妻和三个女儿的肥胖的羊毛商人
I'm a fat wool merchant with a hen-pecking wife and three daughters.

195
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:37,583
但，不幸的是，他不想随遇而安
But, unfortunately, he won't let it be.

196
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,375
抱歉，男爵，这次不一样了
I'm sorry, Baron. Not this one.

197
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,625
我读过十字军东征的书
I learnt about the Crusades.

198
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,542
圣殿之剑的传说是真的吗？
Is it true what the Templar swords say?

199
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:17,958
"耶稣的勇士被保佑而且所向披靡"
"Blessed and omnipotent is the warrior of Christ"'?

200
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,083
对，水。给我水
Yeah, water. Water.

201
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,625
- Hey!
- Agh!

202
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:46,833
你觉得他有什么价值呢？
What do you think he's worth?

203
00:23:48,917 --> 00:23:51,167
- 你为你做的事后悔吗？                   - 后悔无用
- Are you sorry for what you've done?    - Bollocks.

204
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:58,417
- 放开他                - 阿门
- Release him.          - Amen!

205
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,375
爸爸！
Papa!

206
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,375
马上到里面去。
Get inside. Now!

207
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:37,000
- 约瑟夫.
- 男爵.

208
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:38,458
- 丹尼尔.
- 沃尔夫斯坦.

209
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:44,917
贝克特
Becket.

210
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:16,583
你...还是太嫩了点，贝克特
You...are a filthy whore, Becket.

211
00:25:16,667 --> 00:25:18,167
她也嫩
So was she.

212
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:20,625
我们不会守住城堡
We'll never hold that castle with this lot.

213
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:26,250
他们也许不配做圣殿骑士，但他们会守住城堡
They may not be worthy of that cross you wear, but they'll hold the castle.

214
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:29,958
不是为了英格兰...不是为了上帝...
Not for England...not for God...

215
00:25:30,042 --> 00:25:31,500
而是为我而战
but for me.

216
00:25:33,292 --> 00:25:37,042
冬天将至，第一场雪来临前我没回来...
Winter's soon, so if I'm not back by first snowfall,

217
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:42,167
带你妹妹去叔叔那里，把这个交给他。知道了吗？
take your sister to your aunt, give her this. Hm?

218
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,125
努力干活
Work hard.

219
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:47,917
要有礼貌
Be polite.

220
00:27:02,667 --> 00:27:04,667
上面写的是真的？
And what's written here is true?

221
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,208
千真万确，陛下
From my ears to this paper, Sire.

222
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:13,500
泰伯瑞斯, 即刻派六个最快的斥候赶往罗切斯特城堡
Tiberius, six of your fastest scouts to Rochester.

223
00:27:13,583 --> 00:27:15,833
嘱咐他们守住城堡
Instruct them to hold the castle.

224
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:19,875
- 见到外人格杀勿论                 - 遵命！
- Kill anyone they find there.     - Hyah!

225
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:21,458
钱
Money.

226
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:25,833
你认识这些人吗？
And you know these men?

227
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:29,167
什么让你变成这样？
So what does that make you?

228
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,875
没用的废物
Worthless.

229
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,708
那里就是了
There it is.

230
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:47,542
看上去好小
Looks small from here.

231
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,750
那个...小城堡...
That...small castle...

232
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:54,167
却控制着天下
controls all the land as far as you can see.

233
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,708
耐心点，护卫
Be patient, Squire.

234
00:27:55,792 --> 00:27:57,750
别和女人一样絮叨
As long as there's women.

235
00:28:34,208 --> 00:28:37,958
- 来者何人？         - 兰顿大主教派我来的
- What say you?      - I bring business from Archbishop Langton.

236
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:49,458
伊莎贝尔
Isabel!

237
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:51,667
我们是一伙的
We have company.

238
00:28:51,792 --> 00:28:55,292
我告诫过你，我不能容忍女人喝酒
I have told you before, I will not tolerate drinking.

239
00:28:57,667 --> 00:28:59,167
你就没有容忍什么过
You won't tolerate anything.

240
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,250
我主。城外有人
My Lord. We have men at the gate.

241
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:14,792
我容忍国王，伊莎贝尔
I tolerate the politics of the King, Isabel.

242
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:17,375
我们的婚姻是为了土地和财富
Our marriage was arranged for land and wealth.

243
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,208
你记住这点就相安无事
It would be well if you were to remember that.

244
00:29:24,667 --> 00:29:27,542
(顺着说)他还拥有我们的肉体和灵魂
And he owns us, body and soul.

245
00:29:27,667 --> 00:29:30,167
开门！放他进来
Open the gates! Let 'em in!

246
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,833
你的不期而至，奥尔巴尼男爵
You arrive unexpected, Baron de Albany.

247
00:29:58,917 --> 00:30:01,167
出什么事情吗？
What matter does His Grace send this late?

248
00:30:01,292 --> 00:30:03,792
我们以起义的名义占领这座城堡！
That we claim this castle in the name of the rebellion.

249
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:06,500
如果你是为占领这座城堡而来，男爵...
If your visit is to claim my castle, Baron...

250
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:08,708
你迟了一步
you're too late.

251
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:15,083
不常见的坐鞍
Unusual saddles.

252
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:17,708
- 丹麦人           - 什么？
- Danish.          - What was that?

253
00:30:17,792 --> 00:30:20,750
几个丹麦人，昨晚就到了
They're Danish. They arrived last night.

254
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:27,708
国王的斥候。他的大军距离这里不到一天的行程
The King's scouts. His army is less than a day away.

255
00:30:31,292 --> 00:30:33,417
奥克斯, 快叫卫兵来
Oaks, get the guard here quickly.

256
00:30:55,292 --> 00:30:58,542
两天前那人还在达尔奈的城堡
That one was at Darnay Castle two days ago.

257
00:31:08,625 --> 00:31:09,875
Aargh!

258
00:31:42,583 --> 00:31:43,958
Argh!

259
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:53,375
No. No, no!

260
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,083
马歇尔, 蹲下来！
Marshal, down!

261
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,875
Yargh!

262
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:39,250
男爵
Baron.

263
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:42,458
别轻举妄动！站住不许动
Stand down! Stand down!

264
00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:44,333
听我说
Listen to me.

265
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:49,250
依据大主教的名义，我们宣布这个城堡起义
By the archbishop, we claim this castle in the name of the rebellion.

266
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:52,708
起义结束了啊。国王向《大宪章》投降
The rebellion's over. The King surrendered to the great charter.

267
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,958
《大宪章》
Magna Carta.

268
00:32:56,042 --> 00:32:58,792
这个是国王亲手签署发布的
This one sealed by the King's own hand.

269
00:32:58,917 --> 00:33:02,917
但现在...他却在处决每一个支持《大宪章》的人
And now... he's executing everybody who supported it.

270
00:33:03,042 --> 00:33:09,417
可是教皇是否知道大主教在皇家城堡里头宣告反抗国王的事？
But does the Pope know that the Archbishop is claiming royal castles, against the King?

271
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,375
我目睹我三个兄弟被杀
I watched as three of my brothers were killed

272
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:16,708
国王的暴行正在毁了他的统治之路
by the soft hand of a king that is murdering his way across the country.

273
00:33:18,042 --> 00:33:20,500
而且他还没有一丝忏悔
And he does so with the Pope's blessing.

274
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:24,417
法国军队已经出洋开进了
The French army make sail any day now.

275
00:33:25,792 --> 00:33:28,875
让我们...另立一个新国王
Giving us...a new king.

276
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,375
一个英明的国王
A true king.

277
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:37,000
关闭城门
Seal the gates.

278
00:33:37,125 --> 00:33:42,625
锁上所有的大门！快行动！奥克斯, 别让任何人进来
Lock all the doors! Move! And, Oaks, no one else comes in.

279
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,250
好吧
Very well.

280
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:46,958
好吧，马歇尔...
Well, Marshal...

281
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,208
你来领导防守这个城堡吧
you got us our castle.

282
00:33:53,917 --> 00:33:57,542
- 队长，你的手下呢？                - 11个全副武装的战士
- What is your strength, Captain?   - Eleven men-at-arms.

283
00:33:58,917 --> 00:34:01,292
- 我们还不到20人？                  - 这些城墙
- We have less than 20 men?         - And these walls.

284
00:34:01,417 --> 00:34:04,292
- 他们未遭背弃                   - 内城碉堡有吊闸吗？
- They've never been breached.   - Does the keep have a portcullis?

285
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,458
- 有                  - 好
- It does.            - Good.

286
00:34:09,875 --> 00:34:14,250
- 一旦关门，就没人进的来             - 水. 水源在哪里？
- Once it's down, no one gets in.    - Water. Where is the supply?

287
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:18,708
井里，直接来源于河水。水源充足
From the Well. Draws straight from the river. No one here gets thirsty.

288
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,875
- 不错。水质没问题吧？                    - 水质不错
- it's good, it's not sick or brackish?   - Water's good, sir.

289
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,875
小伙子，跟我来
Guy, with me.

290
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:33,375
这些城墙设计成保护每个点的战士
These walls are designed to be defended by one man per station.

291
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:36,458
外观完美。 任何一处都可以看到几英里远
Outlook is perfect. Any approach can be seen for miles.

292
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:40,917
现在，咱们去大门警戒室（建于通道之上）瞧瞧
Now, let's see the gatehouse.

293
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:49,875
你们，日以继夜，保持警惕。现在打开城门
You, day or night, stay alert. Now open it up.

294
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:07,875
有什么问题？
What's the problem?

295
00:35:08,958 --> 00:35:11,458
没有护城河
There's no moat.

296
00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:31,833
这个行
That'll do.

297
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:35,083
现在，他们来袭时...
Now, when they come...

298
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:37,542
..狠狠打
..hit them hard.

299
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:40,083
打打靶子看看
Hit the post.

300
00:35:44,417 --> 00:35:47,667
我是说，狠狠地打靶子
I said, hit the post. Hard.

301
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,875
法国援军会来吧？
They'll come? The French.

302
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:58,958
以前在达玛斯库战役中，我们盼望的法国援军就没来
We waited for the French at Damascus. They didn't come then.

303
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:02,708
指望法国人会来有点像赌博
Even to a Frenchman I think Rochester is nearer than Damascus.

304
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:05,083
继续练习
Hit it.

305
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:10,875
年轻人，你最好更用力点打
You better hit it harder than that, boy.

306
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:17,083
否则那些援军还没来你就先死了
Or you'll be dead before they get here.

307
00:36:32,667 --> 00:36:34,917
他们恨女人
They hate women.

308
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
觉得咱们没啥用
Just to look at one's a sin.

309
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:39,125
一些人说他们来铲除邪恶
Some people say they worship the devil.

310
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:43,708
铁石心肠
Celibates with stone hearts.

311
00:36:43,792 --> 00:36:46,375
我也铁石心肠，Maddy.
Then I have a stone heart, too, Maddy.

312
00:36:47,917 --> 00:36:50,042
我并非这个意思
I didn't mean it like that.

313
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:55,042
圣殿骑士团要求忠实于上帝
A Templar offers his Chastity to God,

314
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:56,833
但是妻子...
but a wife...

315
00:36:56,917 --> 00:36:59,667
她需要忠实于丈夫
she suffers hers by her husband.

316
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:04,875
我丈夫对我没兴趣
My husband's appetites don't include me.

317
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,583
感谢圣母玛利亚
Thank the Lord Mary herself.

318
00:37:22,417 --> 00:37:26,042
我很...好奇，奥尔巴尼
Now, I am... "curious, Albany.

319
00:37:26,167 --> 00:37:31,042
为何你和你的朋友们如此执着于起义？
Why is it that you and your friends are so struck with this rebellion?

320
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:34,083
- 嗯                 - 我们是为了人民
- Mm.                - Cos we are for the people.

321
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:38,750
我看到你训练有素多才多艺
I see your esquire is well-trained in the art of naivety.

322
00:37:38,833 --> 00:37:41,667
- 继续说             - 你可以认为我幼稚
- Go on.             - Call me naive if you will, sir,

323
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:44,833
但是人们讨厌一个禽兽般的国王
but the people deserve more than a king that treats them like animals.

324
00:37:44,917 --> 00:37:47,167
哈，护卫的大论
Ah, bold words for a Squire.

325
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:50,250
你读过《大宪章》吗
Have you read Magna Carta?

326
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:53,958
- 我...              - 哈，我明白了。你不懂拉丁文
- I...               - Ah, I see. You can't read Latin.

327
00:37:54,042 --> 00:37:57,417
可惜呀，忽视争论
It's a pity, arguing from ignorance.

328
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:04,083
(说外国话，大伙儿都惊呆了)
Argumentum ad ignorantiam, ab uno disce omnes.

329
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:08,208
那是罗马人的语言吧？
That's Roman, innit?

330
00:38:10,917 --> 00:38:12,792
翻译过来就是“从个体入手了解众人”
From one person, learn all people.

331
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:19,042
原谅我妻子醒目的嘴巴
Excuse my wife's bold tongue.

332
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:38,083
贝克特, 我要去你远端的墙
Becket, I'm gonna need you on the far wall.

333
00:38:38,167 --> 00:38:40,917
- 小伙子没办法单独防御              - 你亲自来执行
- Guy can't defend it on his own.   - Do it yourself.

334
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:45,167
什么？
What?

335
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,500
想喝一杯？女人
You want a drink? A woman?

336
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:56,250
不要拿你的臭脸对着我
Don't you sniff your nose at me.

337
00:38:56,375 --> 00:39:00,250
我在很多场合。我见证你圣洁的兄弟们的所做所为
I've been places. I've seen what your holy brothers have done.

338
00:39:01,042 --> 00:39:02,917
你们虚伪的做法让我恶心
Your pious bile makes me sick.

339
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,125
贝克特. 到外面去
Becket. I want you outside.

340
00:39:09,583 --> 00:39:12,958
我会帮那个小伙子，但谁来帮我
I'll watch your boy's back, but who's watching mine?

341
00:40:14,583 --> 00:40:16,542
警报！
To the battlements!

342
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:19,625
- 警报                        - 动作快
- To the battlements!         - Right away!

343
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:24,083
- 各就各位                    - 迅速集结
- Take your positions, men!   - Get those men up here, quickly!

344
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:27,625
梅采尔, 他们在那
Mercel, they're here!

345
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:43,583
让我们瞧瞧天会不会塌下来
Let's see what rats have taken up in my home.

346
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:45,917
动作迅速点
Move it! Come on!

347
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,083
奥尔巴尼,一句话，你不能不顾及协议
Albany, a word. You cannot engage the King without considering terms.

348
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:53,167
他要我的人头呢。那协议也有这个内容吗？
He wants our heads on spikes. Where are the terms in that?

349
00:40:53,292 --> 00:40:56,417
打战，顾及不了太多了
There are some in here who didn't pick this fight.

350
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,875
问自己为何而战，Cornhill
Ask yourself who you're for, Cornhill.

351
00:40:58,958 --> 00:41:02,667
国王还是国家？因为我们都没错
The King or the country? Because we both can't be wrong.

352
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:08,333
他们来了
They're here.

353
00:41:13,625 --> 00:41:15,125
奥尔巴尼
Albany!

354
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:20,417
奥尔巴尼
Albany!

355
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:25,000
他怎么知道我在这？有什么需要我们效劳的？约翰
How did he know? What can we do for you, John?

356
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:30,708
威廉de奥尔巴尼男爵
William de Albany男爵.

357
00:41:30,792 --> 00:41:35,000
教皇授令我恢复王权
The Pope has ordered me to reclaim my country.

358
00:41:36,417 --> 00:41:41,417
现在，你确定关门对抗国王，和教廷？
Now, surely you don't bar your door against a king, and the Church?

359
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,375
他是否知道你原先签署颁布宪章...
Does he know you sealed a charter...

360
00:41:44,458 --> 00:41:46,917
给予英格兰平民自由
giving the people of England freedom,

361
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
然后现在你又反悔了？
and that now you go back on your word?

362
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:51,750
英格兰是我的，奥尔巴尼
England is mine, Albany.

363
00:41:52,917 --> 00:41:57,167
君权神授，教皇授意我的
God's will bestowed it unto me, the Pope blesses it to me,

364
00:41:57,292 --> 00:42:00,417
而且这个城堡是属于我的
and this castle belongs to me!

365
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,208
（奥尔巴尼对着约翰王）你这个国王...
You're no more a king...

366
00:42:02,292 --> 00:42:04,417
连我屁股上的疮都不如
than the boil on my arse!

367
00:42:05,792 --> 00:42:07,250
Huh.

368
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:10,583
（奥尔巴尼对他的朋友们）多么无聊的一个小矮人
What a tedious little man.

369
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:15,167
准备开战
Get the swords now. Come on!

370
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:18,750
大家赶紧行动
Move yourselves!

371
00:42:21,917 --> 00:42:23,458
各就各位
Stay by your posts.

372
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:27,333
记住，他们要翻越城墙
Remember, they have to climb over these walls.

373
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:29,333
而我们不需翻越
And we do not.

374
00:42:29,458 --> 00:42:31,667
因此要坚守阵地
So you stand firm!

375
00:42:36,625 --> 00:42:38,875
你有以少敌众过吗？
Have you ever fought so many with so few?

376
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:43,208
嗯哈。别忘记守住城墙了
Uh-huh. Don't you forget, you hold the wall, huh?

377
00:42:43,292 --> 00:42:45,917
现在，回你的岗位上去
Now, go to your post.

378
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:07,583
南北分列
North and south advance!

379
00:43:10,042 --> 00:43:12,458
弓箭手准备
Get ready, archers!

380
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:17,542
发射
Loose!

381
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:21,583
注意空中来袭
Take cover!   Incoming

382
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:31,208
再一波！射
And again! Take cover!

383
00:43:32,333 --> 00:43:33,958
快闪开
Get down!

384
00:43:34,083 --> 00:43:35,542
Ha-ha!

385
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:42,375
坚守岗位
Come on, lads, come on! Take your positions! Look lively!

386
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,083
射，给我射
Take cover, lads! Take cover!

387
00:43:51,125 --> 00:43:52,500
Argh!

388
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:57,292
再一波
Again!

389
00:44:07,083 --> 00:44:08,458
Argh!

390
00:44:23,458 --> 00:44:25,458
奥尔巴尼
Albany!

391
00:44:25,583 --> 00:44:27,833
弓箭手！他们进攻了
Archers! They're coming!

392
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:31,417
准备好了吗？
Make a stand! Ready?

393
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,833
拉满弓
Load arrows!

394
00:44:34,042 --> 00:44:35,917
射
Loose!

395
00:44:59,458 --> 00:45:03,083
- 油！扔油弹                 - 准备
- Oil! Bring up that oil!    - Ready!

396
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:05,667
射
Loose!

397
00:45:10,292 --> 00:45:11,875
油！小心背后
Oil! Watch your back!

398
00:45:49,167 --> 00:45:50,542
支援
Take cover!

399
00:46:36,083 --> 00:46:37,458
贝克特
Becket!

400
00:46:38,958 --> 00:46:41,458
这边来
Come on. This way.

401
00:46:48,042 --> 00:46:50,542
- 我们做点什么？        - 祈祷上帝与他们同在
- What do we do?        - Pray God is with them.

402
00:46:52,875 --> 00:46:54,583
贝克特
Becket!

403
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:00,292
Ha, ha-ha-ha-ha!

404
00:47:25,833 --> 00:47:27,917
年轻人
Guy!

405
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,583
去见圣母吧
Show that to your mother!

406
00:47:42,708 --> 00:47:44,417
起来
Now, get up!

407
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,333
给我起来
I said get up!

408
00:47:46,417 --> 00:47:48,500
狠狠地打
Now, you hit him. Hard!

409
00:48:01,833 --> 00:48:04,083
在你身后！清除掉
Behind you! Clear!

410
00:48:04,208 --> 00:48:05,833
支援！
Take cover!

411
00:48:23,417 --> 00:48:24,542
Aargh!

412
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:17,708
他们撤退了
They're running!

413
00:49:17,792 --> 00:49:20,792
他们被吓跑了，他们受够了，男爵
They're retreating! They've had enough, Baron.

414
00:49:43,917 --> 00:49:46,625
狗杂种！去吧，给我滚！
Bastards! Go on, run!

415
00:49:53,667 --> 00:49:57,667
来啊，你们这些外国佬
Come on, you foreign whores!

416
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:38,458
作战勇敢
You fought bravely.

417
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:43,417
很多事你还未领略
You did not see everything.

418
00:50:48,708 --> 00:50:51,958
领略了却再也无法宁静
There's no finding peace after knowing this.

419
00:50:54,875 --> 00:50:56,875
信念，小伙子
Faith, Guy.

420
00:50:59,583 --> 00:51:03,583
只有微弱的信仰...
Only the weak believe that what they do in battle...

421
00:51:03,667 --> 00:51:05,917
战斗让你成熟
is who they are as men.

422
00:51:21,875 --> 00:51:24,000
把他们放在一起
Put him with the others.

423
00:51:25,542 --> 00:51:28,625
把他们放在那边，就这样
Pack 'em over there. Over there, that's it.

424
00:51:30,875 --> 00:51:32,375
奥尔巴尼男爵...
Baron Albany...

425
00:51:32,458 --> 00:51:34,292
还不到一天...
in less than a day...

426
00:51:34,375 --> 00:51:38,375
你把我的城堡搅得乌烟瘴气
you have stripped away everything I gave the people in this castle.

427
00:51:38,458 --> 00:51:43,583
- 天塌了我顶着            - 你都自身难保
- Get off my back.        - You were hellbent on this fight!

428
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:49,042
我们被你拖下水了，还起义
You made us all hostages to your cause, not the rebellion's.

429
00:51:49,125 --> 00:51:52,375
而且这也并非其他城堡
And this was not just another castle!

430
00:51:53,167 --> 00:51:54,917
这是我的城堡
This was my home!

431
00:51:56,083 --> 00:51:58,792
现在把你拉的屎清洗干净
Now clear your mess up.

432
00:52:11,625 --> 00:52:13,625
把门关上
Shut the door.

433
00:52:35,833 --> 00:52:37,917
就是现在
Still now.

434
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,667
在这儿等下
Wait. Here.

435
00:52:41,792 --> 00:52:44,625
- 这个人流血了               - 放桌上
- This man is bleeding.      - On the table.

436
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,125
别。等等。先止血
No. Wait. This will stop the flow.

437
00:52:59,417 --> 00:53:01,792
用力按住
I'm gonna pull this hard.

438
00:53:05,667 --> 00:53:07,917
骨头没断，但...
The bone's not broken, but...

439
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:13,000
继续，来吧
Go on, do it, do it.

440
00:53:24,125 --> 00:53:27,500
清理一下，细心照料他
Keep it clean, and watch him close.

441
00:53:28,958 --> 00:53:30,250
圣殿骑士
Templar.

442
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:34,583
- 你的脖子           - 别
- Your neck.         - No.

443
00:53:34,708 --> 00:53:36,917
坐下
Sit.

444
00:53:38,292 --> 00:53:39,667
请坐下
Please.

445
00:54:18,167 --> 00:54:22,417
如果没止住血，我该不该给你脖子打绷带呢？
If the bleeding doesn't stop, shall I fasten a belt around your neck?

446
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:30,708
有人告诉我你不能眷恋女色
My maid tells me you cannot look at women.

447
00:54:36,625 --> 00:54:38,625
你叫什么？
What is your name?

448
00:54:42,333 --> 00:54:46,208
沉默是不是也意味着你不能和女性说话呢？
Am I to assume your silence means you cannot talk to women either?

449
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:49,833
我叫托马斯-马歇尔
My name is Thomas Marshal.

450
00:54:52,958 --> 00:54:55,083
好了
There it is.

451
00:55:05,458 --> 00:55:08,708
起义是否总伴随着牺牲
And were many sacred vows broken by that revelation?

452
00:55:43,583 --> 00:55:47,042
这不像其他的，河流是天然的屏障
It's not like the others. The river naturally defends.

453
00:55:47,125 --> 00:55:50,833
城墙建的... 所以不多人就挡住了大军
Walls built... so a few can stop many.

454
00:55:50,917 --> 00:55:53,042
别耍我了，队长
Don't insult me, Captain.

455
00:55:53,125 --> 00:55:55,708
我知道对方的兵力
I know the qualities of a Norman keep.

456
00:55:57,792 --> 00:56:00,042
我特别困惑的是...
What I am having trouble with...

457
00:56:00,125 --> 00:56:05,958
1000人的大军居然打不过那20人
is how a thousand men could have failed so miserably against twenty.

458
00:56:06,042 --> 00:56:09,042
这么辛苦作战，为了什么？
Those men fight hard. For what?

459
00:56:09,167 --> 00:56:11,167
就为了这个屁点大的的堡垒？
A small rock in a field?

460
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:12,667
我们绕行
We go around.

461
00:56:14,708 --> 00:56:19,292
我曾曾祖父建造了那座堡垒
My great, great grandfather built that rock

462
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:21,875
那是他征服了整个国家
when he conquered this country.

463
00:56:21,958 --> 00:56:28,292
他关系到伦敦和整个英格兰南部的控制权
Strategically, it fortifies London and controls all of southern England.

464
00:56:28,375 --> 00:56:32,375
为什么你不考虑他们要选择这里阻击我们
Why in God's name do you think they chose to hole up there in the first place?

465
00:56:35,875 --> 00:56:39,500
去激励下军心，队长
What will please your people more, Captain?

466
00:56:39,583 --> 00:56:41,958
你的手下战死在一场伟大的战役
That your men died in a great battle,

467
00:56:42,708 --> 00:56:47,583
或者说你对我的帮助的回报是教会独自离开你的土地
or that your reward for helping me is the Church leaving your lands alone?

468
00:56:47,708 --> 00:56:51,833
因为那是教皇答应的，所有他会这样做
For that is what the Pope promised he would do.

469
00:56:51,917 --> 00:56:55,917
不论希望多么渺茫...
Now, however small it may seem...

470
00:56:56,750 --> 00:57:01,208
..这个堡垒带头了，全国各地都会效仿的
..with that rock, the rest of this country follows.

471
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:07,042
现在你可以按照他的意思去做
Now you see what he means to do.

472
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:10,125
我对你们每个人说
I say this to each of you.

473
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:13,542
现在天正黑...
There's a night out there...

474
00:57:13,625 --> 00:57:17,208
黑的足够让人逃跑而不被发现
deep enough for a man to slip away, if he should wish.

475
00:57:17,292 --> 00:57:19,583
而且我很清醒
And I would understand.

476
00:57:27,542 --> 00:57:29,708
我觉得你触犯了他
I think you upset him.

477
00:57:31,458 --> 00:57:34,208
马科斯，你的意见呢？
What about you, Marks?

478
00:57:34,333 --> 00:57:37,250
我特地为你从昂古莱姆来的
I took this for you at Angouléme.

479
00:57:37,375 --> 00:57:40,083
我走进图卢兹的外围
I walked into this outside Toulouse.

480
00:57:40,167 --> 00:57:44,292
有两次我们看到有人逃跑，你以为我在这里做什么啊?
Both times we saw it through. What do you think I'm doing here?

481
00:57:47,042 --> 00:57:49,542
我可不想收了别人的钱就跑了
I don't take a man's money and run.

482
00:57:53,458 --> 00:57:56,583
菲普斯先生，你和你的手下还继续战斗吗？
Mr Phipps, are you and your garrison men still for the fight?

483
00:57:56,667 --> 00:57:59,917
总共六个人，健全待命
All six of us. Good and ready, sir.

484
00:58:03,333 --> 00:58:04,750
Ah!

485
00:58:22,375 --> 00:58:24,625
我看到你和圣殿骑士一起
I saw you with the Templar.

486
00:58:27,042 --> 00:58:29,792
我觉得他合乎你的心意
I think he has a mind for you.

487
00:58:32,083 --> 00:58:34,583
我并不在意他心里想什么
His mind possesses nothing I care to think about.

488
00:58:36,583 --> 00:58:40,458
他有些不同寻常处。他是个战斗狂人
There is something not normal with him. It's his manner.

489
00:58:41,292 --> 00:58:43,667
我少言寡语
He looks but won't talk.

490
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:47,542
他也没什么好和我说的
Then he talks and nothing he says settles with me.

491
00:58:47,667 --> 00:58:51,917
别说他生来如此。我根本不相信
Don't tell me that was his way before he became a Templar. I wouldn't believe it.

492
00:58:52,042 --> 00:58:54,167
- 夫人        - 什么事？
- My Lady.    - What?

493
00:58:55,167 --> 00:58:57,458
要好好考虑考虑...
That's a great deal of thinking...

494
00:58:57,583 --> 00:59:00,542
有些人就不想去动脑筋
for someone you don't want to think about.

495
00:59:03,417 --> 00:59:04,917
Hm.

496
00:59:12,083 --> 00:59:13,958
他们在建造什么。
They're building something.

497
00:59:15,333 --> 00:59:16,958
什么东西？
What do you think it is?

498
00:59:21,583 --> 00:59:23,958
皇家工程师，陛下
Your royal engineer, Sire.

499
00:59:24,042 --> 00:59:29,042
- 这管用吗？           - 没有护城河，恩...所以，恩...
- Will it work?        - There's no moat, er... So, er...

500
00:59:30,583 --> 00:59:34,208
没有护城河也没有借口。赶紧做好
There's no moat and no excuses. Finish it.

501
00:59:38,542 --> 00:59:41,167
告诉他要做好...
Tell him to construct a...

502
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:01,125
我不该那样说你
I am sorry for what I said to you.

503
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:03,750
我错了
I was wrong.

504
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:12,000
我们接下去会如何？
What happens next...to us?

505
01:00:12,125 --> 01:00:14,250
- 我们？               - 他们会再进攻
- All of us?           - They will attack again.

506
01:00:15,917 --> 01:00:17,917
我们会再守住
And we will hold again.

507
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,500
法国人...
The French...

508
01:00:22,958 --> 01:00:25,958
...海运军队来支持我们
..made sail with an army to stand by us.

509
01:00:27,625 --> 01:00:29,792
你相信他们会来？
You really believe they will come?

510
01:00:30,875 --> 01:00:32,250
恩
Hm.

511
01:00:34,417 --> 01:00:36,125
别骗我, 托马斯
Thou shall not lie, Thomas.

512
01:00:36,208 --> 01:00:38,458
当然不是为了法国人
Certainly not for the French.

513
01:00:39,833 --> 01:00:42,125
不只是我这么说。你这么做不值得
Definitely not to me. It isn't worth it.

514
01:00:56,875 --> 01:00:59,292
这些触犯了圣殿的法规？
Does that break Templar laws?

515
01:01:00,083 --> 01:01:01,208
Mm.

516
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,292
某些人可能会说“行”
Some would say yes.

517
01:01:07,458 --> 01:01:09,708
把剑放下
Put the sword down.

518
01:01:14,167 --> 01:01:17,292
他们攻来时，我要知道我怎么用这个
If they do come, I will need to know how to use this.

519
01:01:21,125 --> 01:01:24,833
- 这样握着吗？               - 如果你想让对方赢
- Is this how you hold it?   - If you want your opponent to win.

520
01:01:34,167 --> 01:01:35,583
我打战...
I fight...

521
01:01:38,708 --> 01:01:40,333
...但你不必参与
..so you don't have to.

522
01:02:00,417 --> 01:02:02,292
攻城塔
Siege tower.

523
01:02:02,417 --> 01:02:05,042
他们在建造攻城塔。该死
Making quick work of it. Damn it.

524
01:02:05,125 --> 01:02:07,625
男爵，我有个主意
Baron, I have an idea.

525
01:02:21,792 --> 01:02:24,583
如果这个不管用下场会如何？
What happens if this doesn't work?

526
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:27,208
- 别问这么多         - 还有更糟糕的吗？
- Don't ask.         - What could be worse than this?

527
01:02:29,125 --> 01:02:32,000
护卫，你杀过哪怕是一个女人吗?
Squire, would you ever kill a woman?

528
01:02:33,042 --> 01:02:36,292
- 没杀过         - 那有不让她受辱而不得不杀一个女人？
- Never.         - Not even if it meant saving her life?

529
01:02:37,708 --> 01:02:39,958
就是它了，放下来
That's it, heave it down.

530
01:02:46,292 --> 01:02:49,167
圣骑士约瑟夫！看到没有
Holy Saint Joseph! Look who it is.

531
01:02:49,292 --> 01:02:52,042
神器准备好了
His Majesty is ready, my Lord.

532
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:02,042
- 路易王子还呆在法国             - 他们还没出发？
- Prince Louis holds in France.  - They haven't sailed yet?

533
01:03:02,167 --> 01:03:06,042
- 好像在谈条款                          - 谈判
- He's buying time to negotiate terms.  - Negotiate terms!

534
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:08,875
国王奴役国家
The King enslaves this country,

535
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,833
教皇支持他废弃《大宪章》
the Pope defends him and calls the Magna Carta heresy,

536
01:03:11,917 --> 01:03:15,583
法国人拿这个做交易
and France uses this tyranny for a better deal?

537
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:18,458
- 难道没人愿意作战？                   - 只有一部分
- Are there any men willing to fight?  - A few.

538
01:03:18,542 --> 01:03:22,458
大部分人认为约翰王签署了《大宪章》起义已经过时了
Many thought the rebellion was over because John signed the Magna Carta.

539
01:03:22,583 --> 01:03:25,583
看来他死掉是最明智的结局了
In some ways, it was the smartest thing he did.

540
01:03:25,708 --> 01:03:27,750
好，万事具备，一切按照计划进行
Well, all that is done.

541
01:03:27,875 --> 01:03:30,375
让罗马爱说什么说什么吧
Let Rome pronounce whatever holy dictum it pleases.

542
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:33,875
他们不会告诉我上帝归他们的
They won't tell me that God is their possession.

543
01:03:33,958 --> 01:03:37,292
我动身去法国。你尽量招兵买马
I leave for France at once. You gather what men you can.

544
01:03:37,375 --> 01:03:40,292
准备伦敦之战
And prepare London for war.

545
01:03:40,417 --> 01:03:42,292
那罗切斯特城堡呢？
And Rochester?

546
01:03:43,958 --> 01:03:47,083
- 那奥尔巴尼男爵呢?     - 但愿上帝和他们同在
- Baron Albany?         - Pray God is with them.

547
01:03:50,542 --> 01:03:52,208
支援
Take cover!

548
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:06,125
好极了。好极了
Excellent. Excellent.

549
01:04:11,167 --> 01:04:13,792
继续推，再快点
Go on. Faster!

550
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:18,625
锁定
Lock it!

551
01:04:30,542 --> 01:04:33,542
- 锁定              - 开火
- Lock!             - And fire!

552
01:04:39,875 --> 01:04:41,125
新造了设备？
They have built an engine?

553
01:04:43,708 --> 01:04:44,750
Yargh!

554
01:04:59,375 --> 01:05:01,042
支援！
Take cover!

555
01:05:05,792 --> 01:05:07,792
你们全到外边去
All of you, outside.

556
01:05:11,417 --> 01:05:14,917
沃尔夫斯坦, 被冲破了
Wulfstan, you've broken through!

557
01:05:15,042 --> 01:05:17,833
来吧！让他们见识下地狱火
Now, come on! Give them hellfire!

558
01:05:17,958 --> 01:05:21,292
放！放
Heave! Heave!

559
01:05:24,042 --> 01:05:25,792
Aargh!

560
01:05:28,333 --> 01:05:31,958
锁定它！火盆给我，小伙子
Lock it! Fire pot, Guy!

561
01:05:34,458 --> 01:05:36,167
你们这些异教徒走狗
You heathen dogs!

562
01:05:55,375 --> 01:05:57,542
向前推进点
Bring it a bit forward!

563
01:05:58,708 --> 01:06:01,000
点火！点火！
Light it! Light it!

564
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:04,250
发射
Loose!

565
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:09,250
Yeah!

566
01:06:09,333 --> 01:06:13,083
可恶！真见鬼
Goddamn devils! Murdering goddamn whores!

567
01:06:19,042 --> 01:06:21,542
好，攻城车着火了
Yes! They burn!

568
01:06:23,375 --> 01:06:25,250
别记载这些
Do not record that!

569
01:06:25,333 --> 01:06:27,375
狗屎
Bitches!

570
01:07:05,458 --> 01:07:07,708
你这个混蛋国王，沃尔夫斯坦
This bastard king, Wulfstan.

571
01:07:07,792 --> 01:07:09,667
Aye.

572
01:07:16,542 --> 01:07:19,667
此后，国王不敢再来了
After that, the king did not come again.

573
01:07:20,792 --> 01:07:23,542
但雨水悄然而至
But the rains did.

574
01:07:23,625 --> 01:07:28,583
天气逐渐转凉了
And the days grew short as autumn turned to winter.

575
01:07:29,958 --> 01:07:33,208
在饥寒交迫中坚持战斗
They were too cold to Fight, and too hungry.

576
01:07:34,958 --> 01:07:37,625
城堡的物资储备已经不足...
The castle stores were empty...

577
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:40,125
大家已经吃掉了好多马
and they had taken to eating the horses.

578
01:07:41,375 --> 01:07:43,917
马圈里仅有一匹马了
Save for one.

579
01:07:44,042 --> 01:07:45,708
马歇尔的坐骑
Marshal's.

580
01:07:46,875 --> 01:07:50,125
但圣殿骑士禁止吃自己的战马
But a Templar is forbidden to eat his horse.

581
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:54,625
战马只能战死在沙场
Their Order dictates that it must die in battle.

582
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:59,292
12个饥饿的灵魂和仅剩的一匹战马
So 13 hungry souls and one horse would remain.

583
01:08:02,167 --> 01:08:04,333
他们依旧在等待救援
Still they waited.

584
01:08:04,458 --> 01:08:06,750
国王这方也在等待
And so too did the King.

585
01:08:09,458 --> 01:08:13,958
他们可以闻到敌军的食物，听到敌军的歌曲
They could smell his food, hear his army's song.

586
01:08:15,042 --> 01:08:20,292
对于人员耗损是一个人的盟友和另一个人的诅咒
For attrition is one man's ally and another man's curse.

587
01:08:21,333 --> 01:08:23,625
因此他们变成了受诅咒的人
So they became cursed men.

588
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:26,792
经过一段时间后
And as weeks turned to months,

589
01:08:26,917 --> 01:08:29,917
他们会觉得...
their minds took to places they should not...

590
01:08:32,125 --> 01:08:37,333
不值得这么做
where a man sees only doubt and has no worth at all.

591
01:08:59,333 --> 01:09:02,750
婚礼上我就知道我的婚姻和爱无关
On my wedding day I knew my marriage would have no love.

592
01:09:04,667 --> 01:09:06,667
我仍然坚持我读上帝的忠诚
Yet still I took my vows to God.

593
01:09:09,125 --> 01:09:13,542
我很自豪并遵守承诺
I honoured and obeyed my commitments daily.

594
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:21,167
你认为我们不一样，托马斯，但你错了
You think we are not the same, Thomas, but you're wrong.

595
01:09:41,292 --> 01:09:44,458
- 我快饿死了           - 你想怎么做？
- I'm starving!        - What do you want me to do?

596
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:48,917
必须做点什么
Someone's gotta do something!

597
01:09:49,917 --> 01:09:51,167
听我说
Listen to me.

598
01:09:52,625 --> 01:09:55,125
圣殿骑士誓言见鬼去吧
Damn your Templar vows!

599
01:09:59,792 --> 01:10:02,708
我的誓言造就了我
It was my vows that made me what I am.

600
01:10:03,958 --> 01:10:06,333
指引我，带我来到这里
It was my Order that brought me here.

601
01:10:07,583 --> 01:10:10,083
还有神的恩典
And by God's good grace,

602
01:10:10,167 --> 01:10:13,833
圣殿骑士才真正为你们出生入死
it will be the Templars that save your life.

603
01:10:19,083 --> 01:10:20,708
你要去哪里？
Where are you going?

604
01:10:22,125 --> 01:10:24,000
你干嘛走人？
Why are you leaving?

605
01:10:44,458 --> 01:10:46,583
他为何离去？
Why would he leave?

606
01:10:50,625 --> 01:10:53,667
你最后见到他
My Lady, you were with him last.

607
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,708
他有否说为什么要离开？
Did he say why he left?

608
01:10:59,083 --> 01:11:00,875
回你房间去
You go to your chamber.

609
01:11:01,917 --> 01:11:03,583
立刻
Now.

610
01:11:04,708 --> 01:11:06,375
不
No.

611
01:11:32,417 --> 01:11:35,542
他要回来才怪呢
I'll kiss the Bishop's arse if he comes back.

612
01:11:41,542 --> 01:11:47,167
他们会回来的，贝克特
You're gonna have to kiss a king's arse,
Becket, cos they're coming back again.

613
01:11:49,083 --> 01:11:51,833
- 是托马斯            - 开门
- it's Thomas!        - Open the gates!

614
01:11:53,625 --> 01:11:56,750
贝克特，接应他！
Becket, get him! Get him, Becket!

615
01:11:56,875 --> 01:12:01,375
快啊！帮帮他！接住袋子，袋子！
Come oh! Quickly! Help him! Get the sacks. The sacks!

616
01:12:01,458 --> 01:12:03,833
- 快来！              - 快
- Come on!            - Hurry!

617
01:12:03,958 --> 01:12:07,333
- 跑！                - 放下吊闸！
- Run!                - Close the portcullis!

618
01:12:13,875 --> 01:12:16,292
你怎么想的？圣殿骑士
What was you thinking, Templar?

619
01:12:16,417 --> 01:12:20,042
他去偷国王的食物。我从没见过这种事
He's stolen the king's food. I've never seen such a thing!

620
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:38,583
你被解除职务了，队长
You are relieved of your command, Captain.

621
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:42,667
坐你的木舟回老家去吧
Get back in your rowboat and go home.

622
01:12:48,125 --> 01:12:50,875
- 没我的人我不走！                 - 哦对，你不走
- I'm not leaving without my men!  - Oh yes, you are!

623
01:12:50,958 --> 01:12:54,458
我告诉你原因。教皇改变主意了
And I will tell you why. The Pope has had a change of heart.

624
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:56,000
你说什么？
What do you say?

625
01:12:56,125 --> 01:12:59,625
我是说，之前招你来打仗
I say that when your pathetic little army arrives back at your houses,

626
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:02,250
现在你可以回家去了
you will find your lands Christianised.

627
01:13:02,375 --> 01:13:06,792
不然的话，你孩子们将给教会做奴隶，你妻子会改嫁
Your sons enslaved to the Church and your wives serving new husbands.

628
01:13:06,917 --> 01:13:09,417
你从没和教皇说过我的领土？
You did not speak to the Pope of my lands?

629
01:13:09,542 --> 01:13:13,708
为什么我以上帝的名义做这些事？
Why in God's name would I do that?

630
01:13:13,833 --> 01:13:15,458
占领城堡，泰伯瑞斯!
Take this castle, Tiberius!

631
01:13:15,583 --> 01:13:20,833
如果失败了，你将流浪回家
And if you do not, you will be sailing home to quite a different world.

632
01:13:33,625 --> 01:13:38,625
Marshal, 你真太牛逼了
Well, Marshal, you sure know how to pick a bit of shank.

633
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:42,125
比三个月的马肉餐好太多了
Better than three months of horse meat.

634
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:45,542
我该吃了就睡。然后呢？
I'll stick with the pig. Then what?

635
01:13:45,625 --> 01:13:47,500
吃掉你
I'll eat you.

636
01:14:01,875 --> 01:14:04,750
Oh!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

637
01:14:12,208 --> 01:14:14,333
护卫...
So, Squire...

638
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:17,750
你认得字吗？
you can read words?

639
01:14:20,292 --> 01:14:22,042
也会写吗？
And write them too?

640
01:14:28,708 --> 01:14:30,208
你全名叫什么？
What's your full name?

641
01:14:30,292 --> 01:14:33,042
Jedediah Coteral.

642
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:48,292
Jedediah Coteral.

643
01:14:49,583 --> 01:14:51,958
Jedediah Coteral.

644
01:14:53,667 --> 01:14:54,917
Yeah.

645
01:14:56,792 --> 01:15:00,208
我头回见到自己的全民是这么写的
I've never seen it written before. Huh.

646
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,667
Hm.

647
01:17:45,417 --> 01:17:48,708
静悄悄的。去查看一下城墙另一头
It's too quiet. Check the far wall.

648
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:30,875
发现敌情！攻击！
To the battlements! Attack!

649
01:18:30,958 --> 01:18:33,958
支援侧翼。侧翼！
Cover the west wing. West wing! Come on!

650
01:18:37,083 --> 01:18:38,833
- 小心               - 来右边
- Watch out!         - To the right!

651
01:18:43,667 --> 01:18:45,833
快救我
Help me!

652
01:18:49,792 --> 01:18:52,042
大门！大门！
The gates! The gates!

653
01:19:28,625 --> 01:19:30,292
马歇尔哪里去了？
Where's Marshal?

654
01:19:30,417 --> 01:19:32,208
战斗！战斗！
Fight, Guy! Fight!

655
01:19:58,625 --> 01:20:00,292
男爵！
Baron!

656
01:20:00,417 --> 01:20:01,667
Aargh!

657
01:20:03,958 --> 01:20:06,333
男爵！
Baron!

658
01:20:26,625 --> 01:20:28,000
别动。就这样
Don't move. Be still.

659
01:20:29,417 --> 01:20:31,667
- 守住内城碉堡          - 你不能死
- Hold the keep.        - You can't die.

660
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:36,667
你不能死，好好活下去！听到了吗？
You can't die. Stay alive! You hear me?

661
01:20:36,792 --> 01:20:39,542
守住内城碉堡！去！快去！
Hold the keep! Go! Go!

662
01:21:15,542 --> 01:21:17,417
Yaargh!

663
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:29,458
菲普斯
Phipps!

664
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:36,292
- 来这                  - 顶住大门
- Come here!            - Hold the gates!

665
01:21:38,708 --> 01:21:40,583
我顶住.我顶住
I've got it. I've got it.

666
01:21:40,667 --> 01:21:42,958
快来，到大门这里来
Come on, to the gates!

667
01:21:43,083 --> 01:21:44,333
顶住！
Hold!

668
01:21:44,458 --> 01:21:46,083
都过来！都过来顶
All in! All in!

669
01:21:53,083 --> 01:21:55,000
快站好
Stand fast!

670
01:21:56,208 --> 01:21:57,708
盾墙！
Shield wall!

671
01:21:58,750 --> 01:22:00,875
盾牌。举起盾牌！
Shields. Shields up!

672
01:22:00,958 --> 01:22:02,333
举起
Up!

673
01:22:02,458 --> 01:22:04,333
Brace yourselves.

674
01:22:04,458 --> 01:22:06,833
准备！预备！
Ready! Ready!

675
01:22:58,875 --> 01:23:00,875
- 伊莎贝尔       - 到里面去
- Isabel!        - Get inside!

676
01:23:00,958 --> 01:23:03,000
即刻
Now!

677
01:23:57,250 --> 01:23:59,625
- 我们去保护男爵！              - 去内城碉堡
- We have to get to the Baron!  - To the keep!

678
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:03,250
- 我们不能撇下他          - 他死了
- We can't leave him!     - He's gone, all right?

679
01:24:15,667 --> 01:24:17,958
稳住！稳住！
Hold the steps! Hold the steps!

680
01:24:18,083 --> 01:24:19,583
来吧
Come on!

681
01:24:23,167 --> 01:24:25,083
马歇尔
Marshal!

682
01:24:40,667 --> 01:24:42,292
砍死他
Pull him down!

683
01:24:47,708 --> 01:24:49,500
马歇尔！快来
Marshal! Come on!

684
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:10,000
让开！让开！
Get it off! Get it off!

685
01:25:14,250 --> 01:25:16,750
回到吊闸背后去
Get back, behind the portcullis!

686
01:25:19,417 --> 01:25:21,667
快点
Come on!

687
01:25:46,875 --> 01:25:49,250
那些囚犯
They have prisoners.

688
01:25:57,208 --> 01:25:58,833
小子
Boy!

689
01:26:11,417 --> 01:26:15,042
下午好，男爵。我的城堡还是归我好
Good afternoon, Baron. Did you find my castle to your liking?

690
01:26:15,167 --> 01:26:17,042
这是人民的城堡
It's the people's castle now.

691
01:26:19,542 --> 01:26:21,292
你不是说他死了吗？
You said he was gone.

692
01:26:22,375 --> 01:26:25,750
把这两个，手和脚全砍掉
Those two. Cut off their hands and feet.

693
01:26:27,042 --> 01:26:29,333
- No.
- No!

694
01:26:31,208 --> 01:26:32,750
No!

695
01:26:33,708 --> 01:26:35,083
No!

696
01:26:36,167 --> 01:26:40,333
现在，男爵，我要有所保留
Now, Baron, I want my keep back.

697
01:26:43,167 --> 01:26:46,042
- 听我指令                - 别！
- At my command!          - No!

698
01:26:46,167 --> 01:26:48,792
- 他们不会投降                 - 真的？
- They'll never surrender.     - Really?

699
01:26:50,625 --> 01:26:52,292
动手
Do it!

700
01:26:54,125 --> 01:26:57,500
动手啊！我们守住内城碉堡
Do something! We hold the keep.

701
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:14,500
你这个暴君！
My arse, your stinking castle!

702
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:24,875
Aaargh!

703
01:27:32,292 --> 01:27:33,708
Aargh!

704
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:39,042
你该死，你连妓女都杀
God damn you, you murdering whore!

705
01:27:39,125 --> 01:27:41,042
我不是国王吗？
Isn't that the king I am?

706
01:27:41,167 --> 01:27:44,917
你不行王道
You betray all that's meant to be king.

707
01:27:45,042 --> 01:27:47,958
你背叛了上帝
You betray God!

708
01:27:48,083 --> 01:27:50,375
我背叛了上帝？！
I betray God?!

709
01:27:52,875 --> 01:27:57,167
我的王位是我父亲传给我哥哥，我哥哥再传给我的
My crown was passed to me by my brother, and my father before him.

710
01:27:57,292 --> 01:28:00,458
我生来就是王
I was born to be a king!

711
01:28:00,583 --> 01:28:04,625
这个是天注定的！君权神授！
It is my birthright! Given to me by God!

712
01:28:04,750 --> 01:28:07,542
你为普通人哭喊
You cry for the common man

713
01:28:07,667 --> 01:28:11,792
你诅咒保护着我的皇冠！
and in the same breath you curse the crown that protects him!

714
01:28:11,917 --> 01:28:15,333
你胆敢质疑我的统治...
You dare to question my reign...

715
01:28:15,458 --> 01:28:18,250
和我之前的国王王室血统
and the lineage of Kings who have reigned before me?!

716
01:28:18,375 --> 01:28:22,750
伟大不朽的阿基坦皇家...
The great amaranthine royalty of Aquitaine...

717
01:28:24,167 --> 01:28:27,792
..从野蛮的游牧部落得到这片土地...
..who forged this land from barbarian hordes

718
01:28:27,917 --> 01:28:31,042
而且血统变得高贵而且纯正
and made it noble and pure!

719
01:28:31,167 --> 01:28:33,792
我代表着权力
Who gave it order, meaning,

720
01:28:33,875 --> 01:28:35,500
甚至代表着信仰
and even faith...

721
01:28:35,583 --> 01:28:39,333
代表着千百年来的忠诚臣民
to thousands of years of loyal subjects!

722
01:28:39,417 --> 01:28:42,042
它就是所有你现在质疑的
And it is all now questioned by you!

723
01:28:42,167 --> 01:28:45,917
而且我们被迫签署《大宪章》
And we are forced to sign your precious Magna Carta,

724
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,750
就是你这个羊毛商人逼迫的
forced by you, a wool merchant!

725
01:28:49,875 --> 01:28:55,375
我是有血性的！我是上帝之手
I am the blood! I am God's right hand!

726
01:28:55,500 --> 01:29:01,500
而且你将永远不会向我发号施令，我是一个国王
And you will never dictate to me how I am to be a king!

727
01:29:05,375 --> 01:29:07,250
现在，男爵
Now, Baron.

728
01:29:08,667 --> 01:29:11,667
该先砍下那边手呢？
Which hand did you touch me with?

729
01:29:13,458 --> 01:29:15,583
砍下他的手
Hold his hand down.

730
01:29:16,625 --> 01:29:19,000
砍下他的右手！
Hold his right hand down!

731
01:29:21,542 --> 01:29:24,417
你不该看这个
This is not something you should see.

732
01:29:43,458 --> 01:29:44,875
Aargh!

733
01:29:48,958 --> 01:29:52,083
告诉你的同伙开门，奥尔巴尼
Tell your rebels to open the gate, Albany!

734
01:29:52,208 --> 01:29:54,583
不投降！
No surrender!

735
01:29:56,458 --> 01:30:00,833
- 不投降          - 砍下他的手！动手！
- No surrender!   - Put his other hand up! Do it!

736
01:30:02,875 --> 01:30:04,042
动手
Do it!

737
01:30:04,167 --> 01:30:05,417
Aargh!

738
01:30:07,833 --> 01:30:09,708
我们能守得住，男爵！
We hold, Baron!

739
01:30:09,833 --> 01:30:11,958
我们坚定不移
We hold!

740
01:30:13,292 --> 01:30:16,167
砍下他的脚，砍下他的脚来！
Put his feet up. Put his feet up!

741
01:30:18,917 --> 01:30:20,083
Cornhill!

742
01:30:20,208 --> 01:30:22,958
你会向国王屈服的！
You will yield to your king!

743
01:30:23,042 --> 01:30:27,208
或者，上帝作证，你的死期不远了
Or, as God hears me, your head is on a spike!

744
01:30:36,792 --> 01:30:41,083
现在，给他上套吊死他
Now, that monster that they've made, strap his carcass to it.

745
01:30:41,208 --> 01:30:42,500
吊死他
Strap him to it!

746
01:30:53,625 --> 01:30:55,250
Heave!

747
01:31:07,708 --> 01:31:09,458
没有援军？
There's no one coming, is there?

748
01:31:48,417 --> 01:31:50,583
斥候报告法国人出兵了
My scouts report the French have left Calais.

749
01:31:50,708 --> 01:31:54,208
几天后他们就会绕道我们的背后
They'll be at our back within days.

750
01:31:54,333 --> 01:31:57,250
你知道吗？当我小时候，
Do you know that when I was a child,

751
01:31:58,333 --> 01:32:04,375
我曾经爱上了我父亲的宠妃
I once secretly ate every urn of my father's beloved honey peaches.

752
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:06,292
接下去的日子里...
And the next day...

753
01:32:06,417 --> 01:32:10,917
他把我带到这个女人面前
he brought before me a servant girl that he had accused of the crime.

754
01:32:12,042 --> 01:32:15,917
他把她的后按在桌子上，然后掏出了刀...
And he placed her hand on the table, and he drew his knife...

755
01:32:18,083 --> 01:32:20,958
...他执行了惩处
..and he delivered the punishment.

756
01:32:22,042 --> 01:32:24,417
然后那个夜晚，也无法掩饰我的羞愧
And that night, unable to contain my shame,

757
01:32:24,542 --> 01:32:28,042
我对他坦白是我干的，
I confessed to him that it was I,

758
01:32:28,167 --> 01:32:31,292
他的犯罪的儿子
his son, who had committed the crime.

759
01:32:31,375 --> 01:32:33,042
你知道他怎么回应的吗？
Do you know what his response was?

760
01:32:33,167 --> 01:32:36,167
他说，“我了解”
He said, "l know.

761
01:32:36,292 --> 01:32:38,417
“我了解”
"l know.

762
01:32:38,542 --> 01:32:41,958
"这就是我只砍断她的手指的理由"
"And that is why I only cut off her finger.

763
01:32:42,083 --> 01:32:45,458
“你要了解，约翰，任何胆敢挑战王权的行为
"You see, John, any action against the throne

764
01:32:45,542 --> 01:32:47,542
都必须得到惩罚”
"must be punished ruthlessly.

765
01:32:49,958 --> 01:32:55,208
“只有这种方式来维系
"For that is the only way to maintain the absolute power...

766
01:32:56,750 --> 01:32:58,417
国王绝对的权力”
"..of a king."

767
01:34:17,542 --> 01:34:21,333
他们来时，你要求觐见国王
When they come, you must demand to see the King.

768
01:34:21,458 --> 01:34:23,583
我不指望他
I want nothing from him.

769
01:34:24,667 --> 01:34:26,333
没有任何的怜悯
Not even mercy.

770
01:34:35,583 --> 01:34:37,833
我违背了诺言，Isabel
I broke my vow, Isabel.

771
01:34:38,917 --> 01:34:40,917
辜负了上帝的信赖
I have betrayed God's trust.

772
01:34:42,750 --> 01:34:44,542
我有罪
What we did was a sin.

773
01:34:44,667 --> 01:34:47,542
别逃避了...誓言和命令的借口没用
Stop hiding... behind vows and commandments.

774
01:34:49,208 --> 01:34:53,875
忠诚和禁欲以及谋杀的誓言，但...
The vows speak of loyalty and abstinence and murder, but...

775
01:34:55,167 --> 01:34:57,542
为何没有爱？
why never love, Thomas?

776
01:34:57,667 --> 01:34:59,792
我在上帝面前发誓...
The vows of the Order...

777
01:35:01,458 --> 01:35:05,583
...绝不滥杀无辜，但我玷污了上帝
..protect my soul from the blood I've spilt in God's name.

778
01:35:05,708 --> 01:35:08,583
是教会让你这么干的
It was the Church that made you do those things.

779
01:35:08,708 --> 01:35:11,333
是圣殿骑士团给予你武器
It was the Templars that gave you a sword

780
01:35:11,458 --> 01:35:13,208
以上帝的名义来使用它
and the name of God to wield it.

781
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:15,958
是圣殿骑士团让你杀戮
It was the Templars that made you kill.

782
01:35:18,208 --> 01:35:19,875
你没入会之前什么身份？
Who were you before them?

783
01:35:21,042 --> 01:35:25,792
是谁使你一改初衷的?
What was so bad about that man then that makes you resist your desires now?

784
01:35:27,333 --> 01:35:28,750
托马斯...
Thomas...

785
01:35:33,542 --> 01:35:35,292
我没罪
I am not a sin.

786
01:35:39,375 --> 01:35:42,125
陛下？陛下？
Sire? Sire?

787
01:35:45,167 --> 01:35:48,292
竣工了，陛下。地道好了
Your engineer, sire. The mine is ready.

788
01:35:48,417 --> 01:35:50,208
管用吗？
Will it work?

789
01:35:51,125 --> 01:35:54,875
- 正好在内城碉堡底部的下方                    - 好
- it's right under the keep's foundations.    - Ah.

790
01:35:57,333 --> 01:35:59,833
记录下来
Then take note.

791
01:35:59,958 --> 01:36:05,000
通知司法官送40头猪给我
To my justiciar, send to me 40 pigs.

792
01:36:06,417 --> 01:36:08,542
至少还能用来吃
The least good for eating.

793
01:36:11,333 --> 01:36:13,458
即刻起运
Deliver that at once.

794
01:36:13,542 --> 01:36:18,917
Come on! Hurry up! Move it!

795
01:36:25,375 --> 01:36:27,000
That's it.

796
01:36:27,125 --> 01:36:31,125
- 你去哪？            - 我打算去讲和
- Where you going?    - I'm going to plead for terms.

797
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:32,375
No!

798
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:35,500
没别的办法了吗？我们坚定守住
What else is there to do? We hold.

799
01:36:35,583 --> 01:36:39,625
坚持到底等谁来？法国人？他们不会来了
We hold for What? The French? They're not coming.

800
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:43,292
- 我去谈判              - 别
- I'll ask for terms.   - No!

801
01:36:44,458 --> 01:36:48,708
我们发过誓。誓言！
We swore an oath. An oath!

802
01:36:48,792 --> 01:36:51,417
为了奥尔巴尼。为了英格兰
To Albany. To England.

803
01:36:51,542 --> 01:36:54,042
誓言是空的
Your oath is worthless.

804
01:36:56,083 --> 01:36:58,833
《大宪章》是空的
Magna Carta is worthless.

805
01:36:58,958 --> 01:37:00,875
教会都废除宪章了
The Church has annulled it.

806
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:04,875
这里发生的一切都毫无意义
Whatever happens here is meaningless.

807
01:37:04,958 --> 01:37:07,875
No. No. Wait!

808
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:12,750
- 够了，护卫                - 贝克特?
- That's enough, Squire.    - Becket?

809
01:37:12,833 --> 01:37:16,083
这个年轻人想杀了那老头
Your boy here tried to take the old man's head off.

810
01:37:16,208 --> 01:37:18,583
贝克特, 放开他
Becket, leave him be.

811
01:37:24,083 --> 01:37:27,458
现在，年轻人...放开他
Now, Guy...get away from him.

812
01:37:28,125 --> 01:37:30,250
- 马上             - 凭什么？
- Now.             - Or what?

813
01:37:31,958 --> 01:37:33,625
你要杀了我？
You'll kill me?

814
01:37:35,083 --> 01:37:36,958
- 年轻人...        - 住嘴
- Guy...           - Shut up!

815
01:37:37,917 --> 01:37:41,667
奥尔巴尼男爵为了信仰牺牲了
Baron de Albany gave his life for his beliefs.

816
01:37:43,792 --> 01:37:46,292
你能做得到吗？
What have you given for yours?

817
01:37:46,417 --> 01:37:47,792
胆小鬼
Coward.

818
01:38:02,250 --> 01:38:04,625
回天无力啊
There's no salvation to this end.

819
01:38:05,833 --> 01:38:07,625
我们...
Our souls...

820
01:38:08,875 --> 01:38:10,625
太丢人了
are damned.

821
01:38:18,167 --> 01:38:19,542
你不是胆小鬼
You are not a coward.

822
01:38:56,917 --> 01:39:00,292
- 你在干什么？           - 写自己的大名啊
- What are you doing?    - I'm writing my name.

823
01:39:01,417 --> 01:39:03,292
你会写？
How do you do that?

824
01:39:03,417 --> 01:39:06,042
小师傅教我的
Master Guy taught me.

825
01:39:06,167 --> 01:39:08,833
你就做这个
Well, that's you all done then.

826
01:39:08,958 --> 01:39:11,083
你有什么好气的？
What makes a man like you so angry?

827
01:39:11,208 --> 01:39:13,208
我一直来气...
I've been angry so long...

828
01:39:13,333 --> 01:39:16,000
我甚至不记得气了多久
I don't even remember.

829
01:39:18,125 --> 01:39:21,500
我觉得你会幸存
It's kept you alive though, I suppose.

830
01:39:23,292 --> 01:39:27,417
我觉得我们过不了这道难关
I don't think it's gonna get us through this one.

831
01:39:47,542 --> 01:39:52,458
- 他们在做什么？                     - 猪油，工兵的火药
- What do you think they're doing?   - Pigs. For a sapper's fire.

832
01:39:54,333 --> 01:39:57,375
- 工兵？              - 他们在我们底下挖地道
- Sappers?            - They're digging a mine underneath us.

833
01:39:57,500 --> 01:40:00,375
猪的脂肪，在热坩埚上燃烧
Pig's fat, it burns, with the heat of a crucible.

834
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:03,167
开道
Make Way!

835
01:40:04,542 --> 01:40:06,833
继续！前进
Go on! Go!

836
01:40:09,917 --> 01:40:11,917
哇啊
Whoa!

837
01:40:12,042 --> 01:40:13,292
哇啊
Whoa there!

838
01:40:14,333 --> 01:40:15,583
哇啊
Whoa!

839
01:40:15,667 --> 01:40:18,042
带进来
Bring them in.

840
01:40:49,917 --> 01:40:52,083
大事不好了
We've got a bigger problem.

841
01:40:53,542 --> 01:40:55,792
上去
Hah! Get in there!

842
01:40:55,917 --> 01:40:57,792
继续！
Go on!

843
01:41:41,667 --> 01:41:43,792
Coteral.

844
01:41:46,458 --> 01:41:48,583
好热
It's hot.

845
01:41:48,667 --> 01:41:52,167
- 那现在怎么做？                  -圣殿骑士
- So what are we gonna do now?    - Templar.

846
01:41:52,292 --> 01:41:54,417
我们去守内城碉堡的另一边
We get to the other side of the keep.

847
01:42:06,667 --> 01:42:09,583
小伙子，带女人去礼拜堂 唔？
Guy, take the women to the chapel, huh?

848
01:42:09,708 --> 01:42:10,958
快去
Go!

849
01:42:11,042 --> 01:42:14,292
赶紧，Isabel
Hurry, Isabel.

850
01:42:32,667 --> 01:42:34,958
下去！下去！
Get down! Get down!

851
01:43:28,375 --> 01:43:31,625
- 我以为他死了               - 我不会再犯错
- I think he's gone.         - I'm not making that mistake again.

852
01:43:31,750 --> 01:43:33,500
来吧
Come on.

853
01:43:38,208 --> 01:43:40,958
喔 一，二
OK.One, two.

854
01:43:53,792 --> 01:43:56,583
噢, Maddy. 她一直伴随我
Oh, Maddy. She was beside me.

855
01:44:06,792 --> 01:44:08,792
贝克特
Becket. Becket.

856
01:44:13,208 --> 01:44:15,458
Ha!

857
01:44:15,583 --> 01:44:17,208
截住他们
I'll hold them Off.

858
01:44:17,292 --> 01:44:20,042
他们付你多少钱让你干这些？
How much did they pay to get you out those stocks?

859
01:44:20,125 --> 01:44:23,667
- 五个先令(英镑之下的货币单位)   - 比妓女还贱
- Five shillings.                - That is cheaper than a whore.

860
01:44:31,208 --> 01:44:34,500
来吧，你这污秽的婊子
Come on, you filthy whores!

861
01:44:48,292 --> 01:44:51,667
如果敌人突破进来，你就杀了妇女
If they get through us, you kill the women.

862
01:44:51,750 --> 01:44:53,667
- 不              - 口头重复下指令
- No.             - Say it.

863
01:44:53,792 --> 01:44:55,833
- 我做不到        - 口头重复下指令!
- I can't.        - Say it!

864
01:44:57,292 --> 01:44:58,542
我会杀了妇女
I'll kill the women.

865
01:45:04,042 --> 01:45:09,458
Come on, you whore! Yaargh!

866
01:45:20,250 --> 01:45:22,000
Aargh!

867
01:45:55,125 --> 01:45:56,542
Aargh!

868
01:46:49,125 --> 01:46:51,375
原谅我
Forgive me.

869
01:46:56,167 --> 01:46:58,292
托马斯
Thomas. Thomas!

870
01:47:04,083 --> 01:47:05,333
托马斯
Thomas!

871
01:47:23,333 --> 01:47:25,750
去救她
Save her.

872
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:35,625
都不许动
No one touch him!

873
01:47:35,708 --> 01:47:37,458
你现在感觉如何？圣殿骑士
How's your faith now, Templar?

874
01:47:37,583 --> 01:47:39,708
你为什么不靠近点呢...
Why don't you come a little closer...

875
01:47:42,250 --> 01:47:44,250
...我就告诉你
..and I'll show you.

876
01:48:46,667 --> 01:48:48,042
Yaaargh!

877
01:51:33,458 --> 01:51:35,458
你真勇敢
You fought bravely.

878
01:51:37,667 --> 01:51:39,417
杀戮是件高尚之事吗？
Is killing a noble thing?

879
01:51:42,708 --> 01:51:48,000
但是为他人而战就没白活
But a life fought for others is a life worth living.

880
01:51:49,083 --> 01:51:51,625
这就很高尚了
That is a noble thing.

881
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:21,500
法国援军来了
A French prince now holds the English crown.

882
01:52:24,833 --> 01:52:26,458
做决定并不容易
Not an easy decision to make.

883
01:52:27,625 --> 01:52:29,125
就像这次


884
01:52:30,167 --> 01:52:32,042
托马斯，结束了教会的服役


885
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:36,333
你自由了

886
01:52:36,458 --> 01:52:38,083
Your Grace.

887
01:52:39,958 --> 01:52:41,583
来啊


888
01:52:51,625 --> 01:52:53,583
我们坚持住了


889
01:53:11,417 --> 01:53:14,542
不到一年，起义获胜了


890
01:53:14,667 --> 01:53:20,333
约翰王因痢疾而亡


891
01:53:20,458 --> 01:53:23,958
他剩下的财富销声匿迹


892
01:53:25,958 --> 01:53:29,625
期间，伟大的罗切斯特的内城碉堡被重新建造


893
01:53:29,750 --> 01:53:31,375
至今仍屹立不倒


894
01:53:32,250 --> 01:53:37,125
高尚的梦想也同样屹立在那里的是...《大宪章》


895
01:53:38,250 --> 01:53:42,125
