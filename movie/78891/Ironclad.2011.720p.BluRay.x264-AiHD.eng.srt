1
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,625
England, in the year 1215,

2
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:57,542
had been under the reign of King John for 16 years.

3
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,625
The most villainous of England's monarchs,

4
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:05,167
John was renowned for losing wars with France,

5
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,000
levying punitive taxes,

6
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:10,708
and sleeping with the wives of barons.

7
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:15,917
The barons finally rebelled against their king,

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,250
and became locked in a bloody civil war

9
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:23,625
lasting for over three years and decimating both armies.

10
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:28,917
In time, the Knights Templar were drawn into this conflict.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,375
With the help of these highly trained warrior monks,

12
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:36,833
King John and his royal army were eventually defeated.

13
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:41,833
It was agreed that John could remain on the throne,

14
00:01:41,917 --> 00:01:44,375
on one condition...

15
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:46,667
that he would sign a document

16
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,875
upholding the rights and privileges of all free men,

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,958
but ultimately limiting the power of the monarchy.

18
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:57,917
Make it count.

19
00:01:59,042 --> 00:02:02,375
The Magna Carta was sealed at Runnymede

20
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:07,583
on the 15th of June in the year of our Lord 1215.

21
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:10,875
It will be remembered throughout history.

22
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:15,458
What is not remembered is what King John did next.

23
00:02:43,292 --> 00:02:45,250
Sire?

24
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,292
Sire?

25
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,833
It's time.

26
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,792
Hyah!

27
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,500
Hyah! Hyah!

28
00:03:58,292 --> 00:04:00,792
England welcomes you.

29
00:04:00,917 --> 00:04:02,500
Does the Pope hold his word?

30
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:08,458
Oh, how have faith, Captain Tiberius.

31
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:12,250
His Eminence is waiting to hear you hold to yours.

32
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:16,292
The Church will stay out of your lands, you have his word.

33
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,125
We'll get your country back.

34
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:51,667
What say you?

35
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,208
Abbot Marcus. We seek shelter from the storm.

36
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:03,125
Open the gates!

37
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,625
Come and help.

38
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,583
What business do you have here?

39
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,017
Our business is with God at Canterbury.

40
00:05:37,017 --> 00:05:38,000
We need only shelter.

41
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,458
Shelter you shall have. Food also.

42
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:42,375
You treat the Lord's servants well.

43
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:45,958
You wear the mark of the Templars, yet you carry no swords.

44
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:47,792
These men have no more need to fight.

45
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:51,833
Templars masking their faith and travelling without swords.

46
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:53,125
How noble!

47
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:56,417
As God is our witness, Baron, these men have nothing to hide.

48
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,250
Abbot, save your benedictions. The Templars fought against the King.

49
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:04,500
Now you sleep in a king's castle. These men have plenty to hide.

50
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,375
You there. What say you?

51
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,375
They say nothing. They hold vows of silence.

52
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,375
Templars without tongues. Very well.

53
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,833
Just be gone by the morning.

54
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:26,750
Back inside!

55
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,417
Marshal.

56
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,250
When I accept guardianship over men who take the vows of silence,

57
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:45,625
I'm also informed of what led them to me in the first place.

58
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:48,708
I know the Templars placed a heavy burden on you.

59
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,542
I know you're deeply scarred.

60
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,083
The cross on your tunic

61
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:57,125
is a symbol of your faith in God's will.

62
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:01,417
It should not be full of the torment, it now bears upon your soul.

63
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:04,625
When we arrive at Canterbury,

64
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:09,042
I'm requesting your leave from the Order of the Knights Templar.

65
00:07:57,292 --> 00:08:00,958
Garrison men!

66
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:04,167
King John!

67
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,000
Men, to the gates! It's the King!

68
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,208
Open the gates for the King!

69
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:25,542
Marshal, did you see royal colours?

70
00:08:55,417 --> 00:08:57,875
Is that your hand, Darnay?

71
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,208
Forced, Your Highness.

72
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:04,583
The barons threatened my life, forcing me to sign it and betray you.

73
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,583
I know the feeling.

74
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:09,417
Hang him!

75
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,458
This insanity must cease.

76
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:17,208
Open the door. His quarrel is not with us.

77
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:20,583
If you three stand before the King, there will be nothing but death.

78
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:42,292
What good fortune, Darnay. It seems you will have your last rites.

79
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,750
My Lord, Templars.

80
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:47,375
He's travelling en route to Canterbury with Templars.

81
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:54,292
To what do I owe the pleasure of the Church visiting my castle?

82
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:58,583
We were in the storm, Sire. Baron Darnay granted us your hospitality.

83
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:00,500
- We?  - My fellow priests.

84
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,958
Ah, yes, I heard.

85
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:04,292
Templars.

86
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:08,458
Sire, we entered your castle as unarmed men. We seek no fight.

87
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:11,292
Are you aware, Abbot,

88
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:14,750
that your kind stood at Runnymede and forced my signature,

89
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,667
and now you sleep under my roof?

90
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,000
Your Highness, we travel to Canterbury

91
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,458
with simple articles of faith.

92
00:10:22,542 --> 00:10:24,917
I ask your mercy that we may pass.

93
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:27,667
And I will grant you the same mercy

94
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:31,367
that the Church and the barons of this country bestowed unto me.

95
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:34,958
"Do unto others", isn't that right, Abbot?

96
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,917
Tiberius!

97
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,333
Don't let them go!

98
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:23,833
Ride!

99
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,833
There is worth...

100
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,708
in every death.

101
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:43,417
And I will see it now in yours.

102
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,208
- You saw the King?  - Yes. And he saw me.

103
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:33,042
I didn't imagine that even he was capable of such cruelty.

104
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,208
Abbot Marcus was the finest of men.

105
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:41,083
Tell me, why did he request that you leave the Order?

106
00:14:41,167 --> 00:14:45,042
- Your Grace, I did not wish to be dismissed.  - But that's not what I asked.

107
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,792
You were in the Holy Lands?

108
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:52,625
Hm. Some men have returned from defending our faith

109
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:55,083
only to find themselves questioning it.

110
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,792
Now you must ask yourself, Thomas...

111
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,958
what is in your heart?

112
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,583
Rebellion or revenge.

113
00:15:05,792 --> 00:15:09,042
I suppose it makes no difference as the King has the devil in his.

114
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:12,958
I don't care if he's talking to the Pope! I have to see him now!

115
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:14,667
And as we speak of the devil...

116
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,250
My Lord Archbishop.

117
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:22,125
They told me about Darnay.

118
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,292
We took John at his word...

119
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:27,000
and now he raises a bitch's army with God's teeth.

120
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,417
I'll bow to no king with piss for blood!

121
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,958
Baron William de Albany, Brother Thomas Marshal.

122
00:15:32,042 --> 00:15:34,750
Brother Thomas comes directly from Darnay Castle.

123
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,083
You must forgive our Baron, Brother Thomas, 

124
00:15:37,133 --> 00:15:39,783
his tongue is not always so profane.

125
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:44,667
Now, you should know that Rome sides with the King.

126
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:50,083
And the Pope would bless what the King did to Abbot Marcus?

127
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:51,292
More or less.

128
00:15:53,542 --> 00:15:57,292
I am to be excommunicated for writing Magna Carta .

129
00:15:57,417 --> 00:15:59,875
- How long have we got?  - God knows.

130
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,833
Your Grace, this...

131
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,625
king... must be stopped.

132
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:12,125
I cannot, in all honesty, ask you to fight, Thomas,

133
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:17,083
but if you choose to take up your sword, you have my blessing.

134
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,625
It's a good omen.

135
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:01,292
God is with us.

136
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:05,167
Prince Louis has an army may be persuaded to join us.

137
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,500
Asking the French for help...

138
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,458
that's cursing the blind for the wicked.

139
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:15,083
If John takes the Dover Road to London

140
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:19,292
he has to cross the Medway here at Rochester.

141
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:21,750
I'll seize Rochester Castle.

142
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,083
Delay them. That'll give you time to negotiate with the French.

143
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:29,042
We have no force to fight the King.

144
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:32,167
I have a few men I can count on.

145
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:36,250
Absolutely not. Suicide is a sin in the eyes of the Church, Baron.

146
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:40,750
Your Grace, I'm afraid I only see one thing.

147
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:45,792
From Rochester, the King is able to dispatch his troops and supplies

148
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,958
all over the country.

149
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:53,875
It is his keystone. Without it we will not stop him.

150
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,792
All my sins to this.

151
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,208
May God protect what we are about to do.

152
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,458
Guy!

153
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:46,667
Squire!

154
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,458
I want you to ride back.

155
00:18:53,542 --> 00:18:55,417
No. I know how to fight.

156
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,875
You see how he talks to me?

157
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,875
Have you ever killed a man, Squire? Eh?

158
00:19:04,792 --> 00:19:08,500
Then you will learn, it is not a noble thing.

159
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,542
Not even when it's for freedom?

160
00:19:10,542 --> 00:19:12,292
Not even when it is for God.

161
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,500
Hah!

162
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,458
Look at you!

163
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:06,375
Any one of you throws a turd or a bean, I'll get you!

164
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,000
And you know I will! 

165
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,708
- Where's the butchers?  - Over there.

166
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,167
I'll remember your faces!

167
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:19,917
Sheep shears! They're sharp! Sharp sheep shears!

168
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,708
- I'm looking for Daniel Marks.  - Wait here.

169
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:25,792
Marks!

170
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:32,667
Whatever it is or how much...

171
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:38,375
- just get me out of here, Baron.  - Done. Where's de Lacy?

172
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,833
- He went back to Poitou  - Becket?

173
00:20:40,917 --> 00:20:43,042
You don't want him.

174
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,708
Templars. They've come back.

175
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:58,083
Here. You may need protection.

176
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,417
Get up.

177
00:21:16,417 --> 00:21:19,000
I said, get up!

178
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,208
You sack of shit!

179
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,500
Billy.

180
00:21:25,792 --> 00:21:27,542
What told me I'd see you?

181
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,492
What's with the altar boy? 

182
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:31,792
Billy all tied up with God again?

183
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:37,958
- This is not our man.  - Hoy!

184
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:42,042
I'm his man, don't you worry about that.

185
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:46,750
If he pays me enough, I'll split the gut of any man alive.

186
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,583
Ain't that right, Billy boy?

187
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:05,333
- Who's with you?  - Gil Becket. Daniel Marks.

188
00:22:05,417 --> 00:22:08,792
The last time we were all together must have been Dieppe.

189
00:22:08,917 --> 00:22:10,875
The days when the King was still good to us.

190
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:13,167
He's taken all the castles along the coast.

191
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,375
If he takes Rochester, he'll control southern England.

192
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:20,417
If the whispers I've heard are true, he's too strong now.

193
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:24,083
He's got an army of Danish mercenaries.

194
00:22:24,167 --> 00:22:26,000
Wait for him in London.

195
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:30,833
Do you think I want this? I'm not a soldier, not any more.

196
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:34,750
I'm a fat wool merchant with a hen-pecking wife and three daughters.

197
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:37,583
But, unfortunately, he won't let it be.

198
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,375
I'm sorry, Baron. Not this one.

199
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,625
I learnt about the Crusades.

200
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,542
Is it true what the Templar swords say?

201
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:17,958
"Blessed and omnipotent is the warrior of Christ" ?

202
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,083
Yeah, water. Water.

203
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,625
- Hey!  - Agh!

204
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:46,833
What do you think he's worth?

205
00:23:48,917 --> 00:23:51,167
- Are you sorry for what you've done?  - Bollocks.

206
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:58,417
- Release him.  - Amen!

207
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,375
Papa!

208
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,375
Get inside. Now!

209
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:37,000
- Joseph.  - Baron.

210
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:38,458
- Daniel.  - Wulfstan.

211
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:44,917
Becket.

212
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:16,583
You... are a filthy whore, Becket.

213
00:25:16,667 --> 00:25:18,167
So was she.

214
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:20,625
We'll never hold that castle with this lot.

215
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:24,550
They may not be worthy of that cross you wear, 

216
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:26,250
but they'll hold the castle.

217
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:29,958
Not for England... not for God...

218
00:25:30,042 --> 00:25:31,500
but for me.

219
00:25:33,292 --> 00:25:37,042
Winter's soon, so if I'm not back by first snowfall,

220
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:42,167
take your sister to your aunt, give her this.

221
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,125
Work hard.

222
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:47,917
Be polite.

223
00:27:02,667 --> 00:27:04,667
And what's written here is true?

224
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,208
From my ears to this paper, Sire.

225
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:13,500
Tiberius, six of your fastest scouts to Rochester.

226
00:27:13,583 --> 00:27:15,833
Instruct them to hold the castle.

227
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:19,875
- Kill anyone they find there.  - Hyah!

228
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:21,458
Money.

229
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:25,833
How do you know these men?

230
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:29,167
So what does that make you?

231
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,875
Worthless.

232
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,708
There it is.

233
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:47,542
Looks small from here.

234
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,750
That... small castle...

235
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:54,167
controls all the land as far as you can see.

236
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,708
Be patient, Squire.

237
00:27:55,792 --> 00:27:57,750
As long as there's women.

238
00:28:34,208 --> 00:28:37,958
- What say you?  - I bring business from Archbishop Langton.

239
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:49,458
Isabel!

240
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:51,667
We have company.

241
00:28:51,792 --> 00:28:55,292
I have told you before, I will not tolerate drinking.

242
00:28:57,667 --> 00:28:59,167
You won't tolerate anything.

243
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,250
My lord. We have men at the gate.

244
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:14,792
I tolerate the politics of the King, Isabel.

245
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:17,375
Our marriage was arranged for land and wealth.

246
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,208
It would be well if you were to remember that.

247
00:29:24,667 --> 00:29:27,542
And he owns us, body and soul.

248
00:29:27,667 --> 00:29:30,167
Open the gates! Let them in!

249
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,833
You arrive unexpected, Baron de Albany.

250
00:29:58,917 --> 00:30:01,167
What matter does His Grace send this late?

251
00:30:01,292 --> 00:30:03,792
That we claim this castle in the name of the rebellion.

252
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:06,500
If your visit is to claim my castle, Baron...

253
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:08,708
you're too late.

254
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:15,083
Unusual saddles.

255
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:17,708
- Danish.  - What was that?

256
00:30:17,792 --> 00:30:20,750
They're Danish. They arrived last night.

257
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:27,708
The King's scouts. His army is less than a day away.

258
00:30:31,292 --> 00:30:33,417
Oaks, get the guard here quickly.

259
00:30:55,292 --> 00:30:58,542
That one was at Darnay Castle two days ago.

260
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:53,375
No, no, no!

261
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,083
Marshal, down!

262
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:39,250
Baron.

263
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:42,458
Stand down! Stand down!

264
00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:44,333
Listen to me.

265
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:49,250
By the archbishop, we claim this castle in the name of the rebellion.

266
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:52,708
The rebellion's over. The King surrendered to the great charter.

267
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,958
Magna Carta.

268
00:32:56,042 --> 00:32:58,792
This one sealed by the King's own hand.

269
00:32:58,917 --> 00:33:02,917
And now... he's executing everybody who supported it.

270
00:33:03,042 --> 00:33:09,417
But does the Pope know that the Archbishop is claiming royal castles, against the King?

271
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,375
I watched as three of my brothers were killed

272
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:14,408
by the soft hand of a king 

273
00:33:14,458 --> 00:33:16,708
that is murdering his way across the country.

274
00:33:18,042 --> 00:33:20,500
And he does so with the Pope's blessing.

275
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:24,417
The French army make sail any day now.

276
00:33:25,792 --> 00:33:28,875
Giving us... a new king.

277
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,375
A true king.

278
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:37,000
Seal the gates.

279
00:33:37,125 --> 00:33:42,625
Lock all the doors! Move! And, Oaks, no one else comes in.

280
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,250
Very well.

281
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:46,958
Well, Marshal...

282
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,208
you got us our castle.

283
00:33:53,917 --> 00:33:57,542
- What is your strength, Captain?  - Eleven men-at-arms.

284
00:33:58,917 --> 00:34:01,292
- We have less than 20 men?  - And these walls.

285
00:34:01,417 --> 00:34:04,292
- They've never been breached.  - Does the keep have a portcullis?

286
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,458
- It does.  - Good.

287
00:34:09,875 --> 00:34:14,250
- Once it's down, no one gets in.  - Water. Where is the supply?

288
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:18,708
From the well. Draws straight from the river. No one here gets thirsty.

289
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,875
- It's good, it's not sick or brackish?  - Water's good, sir.

290
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,875
Guy, with me.

291
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:33,375
These walls are designed to be defended by one man per station.

292
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:36,458
Outlook is perfect. Any approach can be seen for miles.

293
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:40,917
Now, let's see the gatehouse.

294
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:49,875
You, day or night, stay alert. Now open it up.

295
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:07,875
What's the problem?

296
00:35:08,958 --> 00:35:11,458
There's no moat.

297
00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:31,833
That'll do.

298
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:35,083
Now, when they come...

299
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:37,542
hit them hard.

300
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:40,083
Hit the post.

301
00:35:44,417 --> 00:35:47,667
I said, hit the post. Hard.

302
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,875
They'll come? The French.

303
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:58,958
We waited for the French at Damascus. They didn't come then.

304
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:02,708
Even to a Frenchman I think Rochester is nearer than Damascus.

305
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:05,083
Hit it.

306
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:10,875
You better hit it harder than that, boy.

307
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:17,083
Or you'll be dead before they get here.

308
00:36:32,667 --> 00:36:34,917
They hate women.

309
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Just to look at one's a sin.

310
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:39,125
Some people say they worship the devil.

311
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:43,708
Celibates with stone hearts.

312
00:36:43,792 --> 00:36:46,375
Then I have a stone heart, too, Maddy.

313
00:36:47,917 --> 00:36:50,042
I didn't mean it like that.

314
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:55,042
A Templar offers his chastity to God,

315
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:56,833
but a wife...

316
00:36:56,917 --> 00:36:59,667
she suffers hers by her husband.

317
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:04,875
My husband's appetites don't include me.

318
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,583
Thank the Lord Mary herself.

319
00:37:22,417 --> 00:37:26,042
Now, I am... curious, Albany.

320
00:37:26,167 --> 00:37:31,042
Why is it that you and your friends are so struck with this rebellion?

321
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:34,083
- Mm.  - Because we are for the people.

322
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:38,750
I see your esquire is well-trained in the art of naivety.

323
00:37:38,833 --> 00:37:41,667
- Go on.  - Call me naive if you will, sir,

324
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:44,833
but the people deserve more than a king that treats them like animals.

325
00:37:44,917 --> 00:37:47,167
Ah, bold words for a Squire.

326
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:50,250
Have you read Magna Carta?

327
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:53,958
- I...  - Ah, I see. You can't read Latin.

328
00:37:54,042 --> 00:37:57,417
It's a pity, arguing from ignorance.

329
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:04,083
Argumentum ad ignorantiam, ab uno disce omnes.

330
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:08,208
That's Roman, isn't it?

331
00:38:10,917 --> 00:38:12,792
From one person, learn all people.

332
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:19,042
Excuse my wife's bold tongue.

333
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:38,083
Becket, I'm gonna need you on the far wall.

334
00:38:38,167 --> 00:38:40,917
- Guy can't defend it on his own.  - Do it yourself.

335
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:45,167
What?

336
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,500
You want a drink? A woman?

337
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:56,250
Don't you sniff your nose at me?

338
00:38:56,375 --> 00:39:00,250
I've been places. I've seen what your holy brothers have done.

339
00:39:01,042 --> 00:39:02,917
Your pious bile makes me sick.

340
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,125
Becket. I want you outside.

341
00:39:09,583 --> 00:39:12,958
I'll watch your boy's back, but who's watching mine?

342
00:40:14,583 --> 00:40:16,542
To the battlements!

343
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:19,625
- To the battlements!  - Right away!

344
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:24,083
- Take your positions, men!  - Get those men up here, quickly!

345
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:27,625
Mercel, they're here!

346
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:43,583
Let's see what rats have taken up in my home.

347
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:45,917
Move it! Come on!

348
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,083
Albany, a word. You cannot engage the King without considering terms.

349
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:53,167
He wants our heads on spikes. Where are the terms in that?

350
00:40:53,292 --> 00:40:56,417
There are some in here who didn't pick this fight.

351
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,875
Ask yourself who you're for, Cornhill.

352
00:40:58,958 --> 00:41:02,667
The King or the country? Because we both can't be wrong.

353
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:08,333
They're here.

354
00:41:13,625 --> 00:41:15,125
Albany!

355
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:20,417
Albany!

356
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:25,000
How did he know? What can we do for you, John?

357
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:30,708
Baron William de Albany.

358
00:41:30,792 --> 00:41:35,000
The Pope has ordered me to reclaim my country.

359
00:41:36,417 --> 00:41:41,417
Now, surely you don't bar your door against a king, and the church?

360
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,375
Does he know you sealed a charter...

361
00:41:44,458 --> 00:41:46,917
giving the people of England freedom,

362
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
and that now you go back on your word?

363
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:51,750
England is mine, Albany.

364
00:41:52,917 --> 00:41:57,167
God's will bestowed it unto me, the Pope blesses it to me,

365
00:41:57,292 --> 00:42:00,417
and this castle belongs to me!

366
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,208
You're no more a king...

367
00:42:02,292 --> 00:42:04,417
than the boil on my arse!

368
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:10,583
What a tedious little man.

369
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:15,167
Get the swords now. Come on!

370
00:42:21,917 --> 00:42:23,458
Stay by your posts.

371
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:27,333
Remember, they have to climb over these walls.

372
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:29,333
And we do not.

373
00:42:29,458 --> 00:42:31,667
So you stand firm!

374
00:42:36,625 --> 00:42:38,875
Have you ever fought so many with so few?

375
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:43,208
Uh... huh. Don't you forget, you hold the wall, huh?

376
00:42:43,292 --> 00:42:45,917
Now, go to your post.

377
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:07,583
North and south advance!

378
00:43:10,042 --> 00:43:12,458
Get ready, archers!

379
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:17,542
Loose!

380
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:21,583
Take cover!

381
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:31,208
And again! Take cover!

382
00:43:32,333 --> 00:43:33,958
Get down!

383
00:43:34,083 --> 00:43:35,542
Ha-ha!

384
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:42,375
Come on, lads, come on! Take your positions! Look lively!

385
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,083
Take cover, lads! Take cover!

386
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:57,292
Again!

387
00:44:23,458 --> 00:44:25,458
Albany!

388
00:44:25,583 --> 00:44:27,833
Archers! They're coming!

389
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:32,417
Make a stand! Ready?

390
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:32,833
Load arrows!

391
00:44:34,042 --> 00:44:35,917
Loose!

392
00:44:59,458 --> 00:45:03,083
- Oil! Bring up that oil!  - Ready!

393
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:05,667
Loose!

394
00:45:10,292 --> 00:45:11,875
- Oil!  - Watch your back!

395
00:45:49,167 --> 00:45:50,542
Take cover!

396
00:46:36,083 --> 00:46:37,458
Becket!

397
00:46:38,958 --> 00:46:41,458
Come on. This way.

398
00:46:48,042 --> 00:46:50,542
- What do we do?  - Pray God is with them.

399
00:46:52,875 --> 00:46:54,583
Becket!

400
00:47:25,833 --> 00:47:27,917
Guy!

401
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,583
Show that to your mother!

402
00:47:42,708 --> 00:47:44,417
Now, get up!

403
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,333
I said get up!

404
00:47:46,417 --> 00:47:48,500
Now, you hit him. Hard!

405
00:48:01,833 --> 00:48:04,083
Behind you! Clear!

406
00:48:04,208 --> 00:48:05,833
Take cover!

407
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:17,708
They're running!

408
00:49:17,792 --> 00:49:20,792
- They're retreating!  - They've had enough, Baron.

409
00:49:43,917 --> 00:49:46,625
Bastards! Go on, run!

410
00:49:53,667 --> 00:49:57,667
Come on, you foreign whores!

411
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:38,458
You fought bravely.

412
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:43,417
You did not see everything.

413
00:50:48,708 --> 00:50:51,958
There's no finding peace after knowing this.

414
00:50:54,875 --> 00:50:56,875
Faith, Guy.

415
00:50:59,583 --> 00:51:03,583
Only the weak believe that what they do in battle...

416
00:51:03,667 --> 00:51:05,917
is who they are as men.

417
00:51:21,875 --> 00:51:24,000
Put him with the others.

418
00:51:25,542 --> 00:51:28,625
Pack them over there. Over there, that's it. 

419
00:51:30,875 --> 00:51:32,375
Baron Albany...

420
00:51:32,458 --> 00:51:34,292
in less than a day...

421
00:51:34,375 --> 00:51:38,375
you have stripped away everything I gave the people in this castle.

422
00:51:38,458 --> 00:51:43,583
- Get off my back.  - You were hellbent on this fight!

423
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:49,042
You made us all hostages to your cause, not the rebellion's.

424
00:51:49,125 --> 00:51:52,375
And this was not just another castle!

425
00:51:53,167 --> 00:51:54,917
This was my home!

426
00:51:56,083 --> 00:51:58,792
Now clear your mess up.

427
00:52:11,625 --> 00:52:13,625
Shut the door.

428
00:52:35,833 --> 00:52:37,917
Still now.

429
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,667
Wait. Here.

430
00:52:41,792 --> 00:52:44,625
- This man is bleeding.  - On the table.

431
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,125
No. Wait. This will stop the flow.

432
00:52:59,417 --> 00:53:01,792
I'm gonna pull this hard.

433
00:53:05,667 --> 00:53:07,917
The bone's not broken, but...

434
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:13,000
Go on, do it, do it.

435
00:53:24,125 --> 00:53:27,500
Keep it clean, and watch him close.

436
00:53:28,958 --> 00:53:30,250
Templar.

437
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:34,583
- Your neck.  - No.

438
00:53:34,708 --> 00:53:36,917
Sit.

439
00:53:38,292 --> 00:53:39,667
Please.

440
00:54:18,167 --> 00:54:22,417
If the bleeding doesn't stop, shall I fasten a belt around your neck?

441
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:30,708
My maid tells me you cannot look at women.

442
00:54:36,625 --> 00:54:38,625
What is your name?

443
00:54:42,333 --> 00:54:46,208
Am I to assume your silence means you cannot talk to women either?

444
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:49,833
My name is Thomas Marshal.

445
00:54:52,958 --> 00:54:55,083
There it is.

446
00:55:05,458 --> 00:55:08,708
And were many sacred vows broken by that revelation?

447
00:55:43,583 --> 00:55:47,042
It's not like the others. The river naturally defends.

448
00:55:47,125 --> 00:55:50,833
Walls built... so a few can stop many.

449
00:55:50,917 --> 00:55:53,042
Don't insult me, Captain.

450
00:55:53,125 --> 00:55:55,708
I know the qualities of a Norman keep.

451
00:55:57,792 --> 00:56:00,042
What I am having trouble with...

452
00:56:00,125 --> 00:56:05,958
is how a thousand men could have failed so miserably against twenty.

453
00:56:06,042 --> 00:56:09,042
Those men fight hard. For what?

454
00:56:09,167 --> 00:56:11,167
A small rock in a field?

455
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:12,667
We go around.

456
00:56:14,708 --> 00:56:19,292
My great, great grandfather built that rock

457
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:21,875
when he conquered this country.

458
00:56:21,958 --> 00:56:28,292
Strategically, it fortifies London and controls all of southern England.

459
00:56:28,375 --> 00:56:32,375
Why in God's name do you think they chose to hole up there in the first place?

460
00:56:35,875 --> 00:56:39,500
What will please your people more, Captain?

461
00:56:39,583 --> 00:56:41,958
That your men died in a great battle,

462
00:56:42,708 --> 00:56:47,583
or that your reward for helping me is the Church leaving your lands alone?

463
00:56:47,708 --> 00:56:51,833
For that is what the Pope promised he would do.

464
00:56:51,917 --> 00:56:55,917
Now, however small it may seem...

465
00:56:56,750 --> 00:57:01,208
with that rock, the rest of this country follows.

466
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:07,042
Now you see what he means to do.

467
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:10,125
I say this to each of you.

468
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:13,542
There's a night out there...

469
00:57:13,625 --> 00:57:17,208
deep enough for a man to slip away, if he should wish.

470
00:57:17,292 --> 00:57:19,583
And I would understand.

471
00:57:27,542 --> 00:57:29,708
I think you upset him.

472
00:57:31,458 --> 00:57:34,208
What about you, Marks?

473
00:57:37,375 --> 00:57:40,083
I walked into this outside Toulouse.

474
00:57:40,167 --> 00:57:44,292
Both times we saw it through. What do you think I'm doing here?

475
00:57:47,042 --> 00:57:49,542
I don't take a man's money and run.

476
00:57:53,458 --> 00:57:56,583
Mr Phipps, are you and your garrison men still for the fight?

477
00:57:56,667 --> 00:57:59,917
All six of us. Good and ready, sir.

478
00:58:22,375 --> 00:58:24,625
I saw you with the Templar.

479
00:58:27,042 --> 00:58:29,792
I think he has a mind for you.

480
00:58:32,083 --> 00:58:34,583
His mind possesses nothing I care to think about.

481
00:58:36,583 --> 00:58:40,458
There is something not normal with him. It's his manner.

482
00:58:41,292 --> 00:58:43,667
He looks but won't talk.

483
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:47,542
Then he talks and nothing he says settles with me.

484
00:58:47,667 --> 00:58:51,917
Don't tell me that was his way before he became a Templar. I wouldn't believe it.

485
00:58:52,042 --> 00:58:54,167
- My Lady.  - What?

486
00:58:55,167 --> 00:58:57,458
That's a great deal of thinking...

487
00:58:57,583 --> 00:59:00,542
for someone you don't want to think about.

488
00:59:12,083 --> 00:59:13,958
They're building something.

489
00:59:15,333 --> 00:59:16,958
What do you think it is?

490
00:59:21,583 --> 00:59:23,958
Your royal engineer, Sire.

491
00:59:24,042 --> 00:59:29,042
- Will it work?  - There's no moat, er... So, er...

492
00:59:30,583 --> 00:59:34,208
There's no moat and no excuses. Finish it.

493
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:01,125
I am sorry for what I said to you.

494
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:03,750
I was wrong.

495
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:12,000
What happens next... to us?

496
01:00:12,125 --> 01:00:14,250
- All of us?  - They will attack again.

497
01:00:15,917 --> 01:00:17,917
And we will hold again.

498
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,500
The French...

499
01:00:22,958 --> 01:00:25,958
made sail with an army to stand by us.

500
01:00:27,625 --> 01:00:29,792
You really believe they will come?

501
01:00:30,875 --> 01:00:32,250
Hm.

502
01:00:34,417 --> 01:00:36,125
Thou shall not lie, Thomas.

503
01:00:36,208 --> 01:00:38,458
Certainly not for the French.

504
01:00:39,833 --> 01:00:42,125
Definitely not to me. It isn't worth it.

505
01:00:56,875 --> 01:00:59,292
Does that break Templar laws?

506
01:01:00,083 --> 01:01:01,208
Mm.

507
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,292
Some would say yes.

508
01:01:07,458 --> 01:01:09,708
Put the sword down.

509
01:01:14,167 --> 01:01:17,292
If they do come, I will need to know how to use this.

510
01:01:21,125 --> 01:01:24,833
- Is this how you hold it?  - If you want your opponent to win.

511
01:01:34,167 --> 01:01:35,583
I fight...

512
01:01:38,708 --> 01:01:40,333
so you don't have to.

513
01:02:00,417 --> 01:02:02,292
Siege tower.

514
01:02:02,417 --> 01:02:05,042
Making quick work of it. Damn it.

515
01:02:05,125 --> 01:02:07,625
Baron, I have an idea.

516
01:02:21,792 --> 01:02:24,583
What happens if this doesn't work?

517
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:27,208
- Don't ask.  - What could be worse than this?

518
01:02:29,125 --> 01:02:32,000
Squire, would you ever kill a woman?

519
01:02:33,042 --> 01:02:36,292
- Never.  - Not even if it meant saving her life?

520
01:02:37,708 --> 01:02:39,958
That's it, heave it down.

521
01:02:46,292 --> 01:02:49,167
Holy Saint Joseph! Look who it is.

522
01:02:49,292 --> 01:02:52,042
His Majesty is ready, My Lord.

523
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:02,042
- Prince Louis holds in France.  - They haven't sailed yet?

524
01:03:02,167 --> 01:03:06,042
- He's buying time to negotiate terms.  - Negotiate terms!

525
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:08,875
The King enslaves this country,

526
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,833
the Pope defends him and calls the Magna Carta heresy,

527
01:03:11,917 --> 01:03:15,583
and France uses this tyranny for a better deal?

528
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:18,458
- Are there any men willing to fight?  - A few.

529
01:03:18,542 --> 01:03:22,458
Many thought the rebellion was over because John signed the Magna Carta.

530
01:03:22,583 --> 01:03:25,583
In some ways, it was the smartest thing he did.

531
01:03:25,708 --> 01:03:27,750
Well, all that is done.

532
01:03:27,875 --> 01:03:30,375
Let Rome pronounce whatever holy dictum it pleases.

533
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:33,875
They won't tell me that God is their possession.

534
01:03:33,958 --> 01:03:37,292
I leave for France at once. You gather what men you can.

535
01:03:37,375 --> 01:03:40,292
And prepare London for war.

536
01:03:40,417 --> 01:03:42,292
And Rochester?

537
01:03:43,958 --> 01:03:47,083
- Baron Albany?  - Pray God is with them.

538
01:03:50,542 --> 01:03:52,208
Take cover!

539
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:06,125
Excellent. Excellent.

540
01:04:11,167 --> 01:04:13,792
Go on. Faster!

541
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:18,625
Lock it!

542
01:04:30,542 --> 01:04:33,542
- Lock!  - And fire!

543
01:04:39,875 --> 01:04:41,125
They have built an engine?

544
01:04:59,375 --> 01:05:01,042
Take cover!

545
01:05:05,792 --> 01:05:07,792
All of you, outside.

546
01:05:11,417 --> 01:05:14,917
Wulfstan, you've broken through!

547
01:05:15,042 --> 01:05:17,833
Now, come on! Give them hellfire!

548
01:05:17,958 --> 01:05:21,292
Heave! Heave!

549
01:05:28,333 --> 01:05:31,958
Lock it! Fire pot, Guy!

550
01:05:34,458 --> 01:05:36,167
You heathen dogs!

551
01:05:55,375 --> 01:05:57,542
Bring it a bit forward!

552
01:05:58,708 --> 01:06:01,000
Light it! Light it!

553
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:04,250
Loose!

554
01:06:09,333 --> 01:06:13,083
Goddamn devils! Murdering goddamn whores!

555
01:06:19,042 --> 01:06:21,542
Yes! They burn!

556
01:06:23,375 --> 01:06:25,250
Do not record that!

557
01:06:25,333 --> 01:06:27,375
Bitches!

558
01:07:05,458 --> 01:07:07,708
This bastard king, Wulfstan.

559
01:07:07,792 --> 01:07:09,667
Aye.

560
01:07:16,542 --> 01:07:19,667
After that, the king did not come again.

561
01:07:20,792 --> 01:07:23,542
But the rains did.

562
01:07:23,625 --> 01:07:28,583
And the days grew short as autumn turned to winter.

563
01:07:29,958 --> 01:07:33,208
They were too cold to fight, and too hungry.

564
01:07:34,958 --> 01:07:37,625
The castle stores were empty...

565
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:40,125
and they had taken to eating the horses.

566
01:07:41,375 --> 01:07:43,917
Save for one.

567
01:07:44,042 --> 01:07:45,708
Marshal's.

568
01:07:46,875 --> 01:07:50,125
But a Templar is forbidden to eat his horse.

569
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:54,625
Their order dictates that it must die in battle.

570
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:59,292
So 13 hungry souls and one horse would remain.

571
01:08:02,167 --> 01:08:04,333
Still they waited.

572
01:08:04,458 --> 01:08:06,750
And so too did the King.

573
01:08:09,458 --> 01:08:13,958
They could smell his food, hear his army's song.

574
01:08:15,042 --> 01:08:20,292
For attrition is one man's ally and another man's curse.

575
01:08:21,333 --> 01:08:23,625
So they became cursed men.

576
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:26,792
And as weeks turned to months,

577
01:08:26,917 --> 01:08:29,917
their minds took to places they should not...

578
01:08:32,125 --> 01:08:37,333
where a man sees only doubt and has no worth at all.

579
01:08:59,333 --> 01:09:02,750
On my wedding day I knew my marriage would have no love.

580
01:09:04,667 --> 01:09:06,667
Yet still I took my vows to God.

581
01:09:09,125 --> 01:09:13,542
I honoured and obeyed my commitments daily.

582
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:21,167
You think we are not the same, Thomas, but you're wrong.

583
01:09:41,292 --> 01:09:44,458
- I'm starving!  - What do you want me to do?

584
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:48,917
Someone's gotta do something!

585
01:09:49,917 --> 01:09:51,167
Listen to me.

586
01:09:52,625 --> 01:09:55,125
Damn your Templar vows!

587
01:09:59,792 --> 01:10:02,708
It was my vows that made me what I am.

588
01:10:03,958 --> 01:10:06,333
It was my order that brought me here.

589
01:10:07,583 --> 01:10:10,083
And by God's good grace,

590
01:10:10,167 --> 01:10:13,833
it will be the Templars that save your life.

591
01:10:19,083 --> 01:10:20,708
Where are you going?

592
01:10:22,125 --> 01:10:24,000
Why are you leaving?

593
01:10:44,458 --> 01:10:46,583
Why would he leave?

594
01:10:50,625 --> 01:10:53,667
My Lady, you were with him last.

595
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,708
Did he say why he left?

596
01:10:59,083 --> 01:11:00,875
You go to your chamber.

597
01:11:01,917 --> 01:11:03,583
Now.

598
01:11:04,708 --> 01:11:06,375
No.

599
01:11:32,417 --> 01:11:35,542
I'll kiss the Bishop's arse if he comes back.

600
01:11:41,542 --> 01:11:47,167
You're gonna have to kiss a king's arse, Becket, cos they're coming back again.

601
01:11:49,083 --> 01:11:51,833
- It's Thomas!  - Open the gates!

602
01:11:53,625 --> 01:11:56,750
Becket, get him! Get him, Becket!

603
01:11:56,875 --> 01:12:01,375
- Come on! Quickly! Help him!  - Get the sacks. The sacks!

604
01:12:01,458 --> 01:12:03,833
- Come on!  - Hurry!

605
01:12:03,958 --> 01:12:07,333
- Run!  - Close the portcullis!

606
01:12:13,875 --> 01:12:16,292
What was you thinking, Templar?

607
01:12:16,417 --> 01:12:20,042
He's stolen the King's food. I've never seen such a thing!

608
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:38,583
You are relieved of your command, Captain.

609
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:42,667
Get back in your rowboat and go home.

610
01:12:48,125 --> 01:12:50,875
- I'm not leaving without my men!  - Oh yes, you are!

611
01:12:50,958 --> 01:12:54,458
And I will tell you why. The Pope has had a change of heart.

612
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:56,000
What do you say?

613
01:12:56,125 --> 01:12:59,625
I say that when your pathetic little army arrives back at your houses,

614
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:02,250
you will find your lands Christianised.

615
01:13:02,375 --> 01:13:06,792
Your sons enslaved to the Church and your wives serving new husbands.

616
01:13:06,917 --> 01:13:09,417
You did not speak to the Pope of my lands?

617
01:13:09,542 --> 01:13:13,708
Why in God's name would I do that?

618
01:13:13,833 --> 01:13:15,458
Take this castle, Tiberius!

619
01:13:15,583 --> 01:13:20,833
And if you do not, you will be sailing home to quite a different world.

620
01:13:33,625 --> 01:13:38,625
Well, Marshal, you sure know how to pick a bit of shank.

621
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:42,125
Better than three months of horse meat.

622
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:45,542
- I'll stick with the pig.  - Then what?

623
01:13:45,625 --> 01:13:47,500
I'll eat you.

624
01:14:12,208 --> 01:14:14,333
So, Squire...

625
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:17,750
you can read words?

626
01:14:20,292 --> 01:14:22,042
And write them too?

627
01:14:28,708 --> 01:14:30,208
What's your full name?

628
01:14:30,292 --> 01:14:33,042
Jedediah Coteral.

629
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:48,292
Jedediah Coteral.

630
01:14:49,583 --> 01:14:51,958
Jedediah Coteral.

631
01:14:53,667 --> 01:14:54,917
Yeah.

632
01:14:56,792 --> 01:15:00,208
I've never seen it written before. Huh.

633
01:17:45,417 --> 01:17:48,708
It's too quiet. Check the far wall.

634
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:30,875
To the battlements! Attack!

635
01:18:30,958 --> 01:18:33,958
Cover the west wing. West wing! Come on!

636
01:18:37,083 --> 01:18:38,833
- Watch out!  - To the right!

637
01:18:43,667 --> 01:18:45,833
Help me!

638
01:18:49,792 --> 01:18:52,042
The gates! The gates!

639
01:19:28,625 --> 01:19:30,292
Where's Marshal?

640
01:19:30,417 --> 01:19:32,208
Fight, Guy! Fight!

641
01:19:58,625 --> 01:20:00,292
Baron!

642
01:20:03,958 --> 01:20:06,333
Baron!

643
01:20:26,625 --> 01:20:28,000
Don't move. Be still.

644
01:20:29,417 --> 01:20:31,667
- Hold the keep.  - You can't die.

645
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:36,667
You can't die. Stay alive! You hear me?

646
01:20:36,792 --> 01:20:39,542
Hold the keep! Go! Go!

647
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:29,458
Phipps!

648
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:36,292
- Come here!  - Hold the gates!

649
01:21:38,708 --> 01:21:40,583
I've got it. I've got it.

650
01:21:40,667 --> 01:21:42,958
Come on, to the gates!

651
01:21:43,083 --> 01:21:44,333
Hold!

652
01:21:44,458 --> 01:21:46,083
All in! All in!

653
01:21:53,083 --> 01:21:55,000
Stand fast!

654
01:21:56,208 --> 01:21:57,708
Shield wall!

655
01:21:58,750 --> 01:22:00,875
Shields. Shields up!

656
01:22:00,958 --> 01:22:02,333
Up!

657
01:22:02,458 --> 01:22:04,333
Brace yourselves.

658
01:22:04,458 --> 01:22:06,833
Ready! Ready!

659
01:22:58,875 --> 01:23:00,875
- Isabel!  - Get inside!

660
01:23:00,958 --> 01:23:03,000
Now!

661
01:23:57,250 --> 01:23:59,625
- We have to get to the Baron!  - To the keep!

662
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:03,250
- We can't leave him!  - He's gone, all right?

663
01:24:15,667 --> 01:24:17,958
Hold the steps! Hold the steps!

664
01:24:18,083 --> 01:24:19,583
Come on!

665
01:24:23,167 --> 01:24:25,083
Marshal!

666
01:24:40,667 --> 01:24:42,292
Pull him down!

667
01:24:47,708 --> 01:24:49,500
- Marshal!  - Come on!

668
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:10,000
Get it off! Get it off!

669
01:25:14,250 --> 01:25:16,750
Get back, behind the portcullis!

670
01:25:19,417 --> 01:25:21,667
Come on!

671
01:25:46,875 --> 01:25:49,250
They have prisoners.

672
01:25:57,208 --> 01:25:58,833
Boy!

673
01:26:11,417 --> 01:26:15,042
Good afternoon, Baron. Did you find my castle to your liking?

674
01:26:15,167 --> 01:26:17,042
It's the people's castle now.

675
01:26:19,542 --> 01:26:21,292
You said he was gone.

676
01:26:22,375 --> 01:26:25,750
Those two. Cut off their hands and feet.

677
01:26:27,042 --> 01:26:29,333
- No. - No!

678
01:26:31,208 --> 01:26:32,750
No!

679
01:26:33,708 --> 01:26:35,083
No!

680
01:26:36,167 --> 01:26:40,333
Now, Baron, I want my keep back.

681
01:26:43,167 --> 01:26:46,042
- At my command!  - No!

682
01:26:46,167 --> 01:26:48,792
- They'll never surrender.  - Really?

683
01:26:50,625 --> 01:26:52,292
Do it!

684
01:26:54,125 --> 01:26:57,500
- Do something!  - We hold the keep.

685
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:14,500
My arse, your stinking castle!

686
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:39,042
God damn you, you murdering whore!

687
01:27:39,125 --> 01:27:41,042
Isn't that the king I am?

688
01:27:41,167 --> 01:27:44,917
You betray all that's meant to be king.

689
01:27:45,042 --> 01:27:47,958
You betray God!

690
01:27:48,083 --> 01:27:50,375
I betray God?!

691
01:27:52,875 --> 01:27:57,167
My crown was passed to me by my brother, and my father before him.

692
01:27:57,292 --> 01:28:00,458
I was born to be a king!

693
01:28:00,583 --> 01:28:04,625
It is my birthright! Given to me by God!

694
01:28:04,750 --> 01:28:07,542
You cry for the common man

695
01:28:07,667 --> 01:28:11,792
and in the same breath you curse the crown that protects him!

696
01:28:11,917 --> 01:28:15,333
You dare to question my reign...

697
01:28:15,458 --> 01:28:18,250
and the lineage of Kings who have reigned before me?!

698
01:28:18,375 --> 01:28:22,750
The great amaranthine royalty of Aquitaine...

699
01:28:24,167 --> 01:28:27,792
Who forged this land from barbarian horde

700
01:28:27,917 --> 01:28:31,042
and made it noble and pure!

701
01:28:31,167 --> 01:28:33,792
Who gave it order, meaning,

702
01:28:33,875 --> 01:28:35,500
and even faith...

703
01:28:35,583 --> 01:28:39,333
to thousands of years of loyal subjects!

704
01:28:39,417 --> 01:28:42,042
And it is all now questioned by you!

705
01:28:42,167 --> 01:28:45,917
And we are forced to sign your precious Magna Carta,

706
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,750
forced by you, a wool merchant!

707
01:28:49,875 --> 01:28:55,375
I am the blood! I am God's right hand!

708
01:28:55,500 --> 01:29:01,500
And you will never dictate to me how I am to be a king!

709
01:29:05,375 --> 01:29:07,250
Now, Baron.

710
01:29:08,667 --> 01:29:11,667
Which hand did you touch me with?

711
01:29:13,458 --> 01:29:15,583
Hold his hand down.

712
01:29:16,625 --> 01:29:19,000
Hold his right hand down!

713
01:29:21,542 --> 01:29:24,417
This is not something you should see.

714
01:29:48,958 --> 01:29:52,083
Tell your rebels to open the gate, Albany!

715
01:29:52,208 --> 01:29:54,583
No surrender!

716
01:29:56,458 --> 01:30:00,833
- No surrender!  - Put his other hand up! Do it!

717
01:30:02,875 --> 01:30:04,042
Do it!

718
01:30:07,833 --> 01:30:09,708
We hold, Baron!

719
01:30:09,833 --> 01:30:11,958
We hold!

720
01:30:13,292 --> 01:30:16,167
Put his feet up. Put his feet up!

721
01:30:18,917 --> 01:30:20,083
Cornhill!

722
01:30:20,208 --> 01:30:22,958
You will yield to your king!

723
01:30:23,042 --> 01:30:27,208
Or, as God hears me, your head is on a spike!

724
01:30:36,792 --> 01:30:41,083
Now, that monster that they've made, strap his carcass to it.

725
01:30:41,208 --> 01:30:42,500
Strap him to it!

726
01:30:53,625 --> 01:30:55,250
Heave!

727
01:31:07,708 --> 01:31:09,458
There's no one coming, is there?

728
01:31:48,417 --> 01:31:50,583
My scouts report the French have left Calais.

729
01:31:50,708 --> 01:31:54,208
They'll be at our back within days.

730
01:31:54,333 --> 01:31:57,250
Do you know that when I was a child,

731
01:31:58,333 --> 01:32:04,375
I once secretly ate every urn of my father's beloved honey peaches.

732
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:06,292
And the next day...

733
01:32:06,417 --> 01:32:10,917
he brought before me a servant girl that he had accused of the crime.

734
01:32:12,042 --> 01:32:15,917
And he placed her hand on the table, and he drew his knife...

735
01:32:18,083 --> 01:32:20,958
and he delivered the punishment.

736
01:32:22,042 --> 01:32:24,417
And that night, unable to contain my shame,

737
01:32:24,542 --> 01:32:28,042
I confessed to him that it was I,

738
01:32:28,167 --> 01:32:31,292
his son, who had committed the crime.

739
01:32:31,375 --> 01:32:33,042
Do you know what his response was?

740
01:32:33,167 --> 01:32:36,167
He said, "I know.

741
01:32:36,292 --> 01:32:38,417
I know.

742
01:32:38,542 --> 01:32:41,958
And that is why I only cut off her finger.

743
01:32:42,083 --> 01:32:45,458
You see, John, any action against the throne

744
01:32:45,542 --> 01:32:47,542
must be punished ruthlessly.

745
01:32:49,958 --> 01:32:55,208
For that is the only way to maintain the absolute power...

746
01:32:56,750 --> 01:32:58,417
of a king."

747
01:34:17,542 --> 01:34:21,333
When they come, you must demand to see the King.

748
01:34:21,458 --> 01:34:23,583
I want nothing from him.

749
01:34:24,667 --> 01:34:26,333
Not even mercy.

750
01:34:35,583 --> 01:34:37,833
I broke my vow, Isabel.

751
01:34:38,917 --> 01:34:40,917
I have betrayed God's trust.

752
01:34:42,750 --> 01:34:44,542
What we did was a sin.

753
01:34:44,667 --> 01:34:47,542
Stop hiding... behind vows and commandments.

754
01:34:49,208 --> 01:34:53,875
The vows speak of loyalty and abstinence and murder, but...

755
01:34:55,167 --> 01:34:57,542
why never love, Thomas?

756
01:34:57,667 --> 01:34:59,792
The vows of the order...

757
01:35:01,458 --> 01:35:05,583
protect my soul from the blood I've spilt in God's name.

758
01:35:05,708 --> 01:35:08,583
It was the Church that made you do those things.

759
01:35:08,708 --> 01:35:11,333
It was the Templars that gave you a sword

760
01:35:11,458 --> 01:35:13,208
and the name of God to wield it.

761
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:15,958
It was the Templars that made you kill.

762
01:35:18,208 --> 01:35:19,875
Who were you before them?

763
01:35:21,042 --> 01:35:25,792
What was so bad about that man then that makes you resist your desires now?

764
01:35:27,333 --> 01:35:28,750
Thomas...

765
01:35:33,542 --> 01:35:35,292
I am not a sin.

766
01:35:39,375 --> 01:35:42,125
Sire? Sire?

767
01:35:45,167 --> 01:35:48,292
Your engineer, sire. The mine is ready.

768
01:35:48,417 --> 01:35:50,208
Will it work?

769
01:35:51,125 --> 01:35:54,875
It's right under the keep's foundations.

770
01:35:57,333 --> 01:35:59,833
Then take note.

771
01:35:59,958 --> 01:36:05,000
To my justiciar, send to me 40 pigs.

772
01:36:06,417 --> 01:36:08,542
The least good for eating.

773
01:36:11,333 --> 01:36:13,458
Deliver that at once.

774
01:36:13,542 --> 01:36:18,917
Come on! Hurry up! Move it!

775
01:36:25,375 --> 01:36:27,000
That's it.

776
01:36:27,125 --> 01:36:31,125
- Where you going?  - I'm going to plead for terms.

777
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:32,375
No!

778
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:35,500
- What else is there to do don't you see?  - We hold.

779
01:36:35,583 --> 01:36:39,625
We hold for what? The French? They're not coming.

780
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:43,292
- I'll ask for terms. - No!

781
01:36:44,458 --> 01:36:48,708
We swore an oath. An oath!

782
01:36:48,792 --> 01:36:51,417
To Albany. To England.

783
01:36:51,542 --> 01:36:54,042
Your oath is worthless.

784
01:36:56,083 --> 01:36:58,833
Magna Carta is worthless.

785
01:36:58,958 --> 01:37:00,875
The Church has annulled it.

786
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:04,875
Whatever happens here is meaningless.

787
01:37:04,958 --> 01:37:07,875
No. No. Wait!

788
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:12,750
- That's enough, Squire.  - Becket?

789
01:37:12,833 --> 01:37:16,083
Your boy here tried to take the old man's head off.

790
01:37:16,208 --> 01:37:18,583
Becket, leave him be.

791
01:37:24,083 --> 01:37:27,458
Now, Guy... get away from him.

792
01:37:28,125 --> 01:37:30,250
- Now.  - Or what?

793
01:37:31,958 --> 01:37:33,625
You'll kill me?

794
01:37:35,083 --> 01:37:36,958
- Guy...  - Shut up!

795
01:37:37,917 --> 01:37:41,667
Baron de Albany gave his life for his beliefs.

796
01:37:43,792 --> 01:37:46,292
What have you given for yours?

797
01:37:46,417 --> 01:37:47,792
Coward.

798
01:38:02,250 --> 01:38:04,625
There's no salvation to this end.

799
01:38:05,833 --> 01:38:07,625
Our souls...

800
01:38:08,875 --> 01:38:10,625
are damned.

801
01:38:18,167 --> 01:38:19,542
You are not a coward.

802
01:38:56,917 --> 01:39:00,292
- What are you doing?  - I'm writing my name.

803
01:39:01,417 --> 01:39:03,292
How do you do that?

804
01:39:03,417 --> 01:39:06,042
Master Guy taught me.

805
01:39:06,167 --> 01:39:08,833
Well, that's you all done then.

806
01:39:08,958 --> 01:39:11,083
What makes a man like you so angry?

807
01:39:11,208 --> 01:39:13,208
I've been angry so long...

808
01:39:13,333 --> 01:39:16,000
I don't even remember.

809
01:39:18,125 --> 01:39:21,500
It's kept you alive though, I suppose.

810
01:39:23,292 --> 01:39:27,417
I don't think it's gonna get us through this one.

811
01:39:47,542 --> 01:39:52,458
- What do you think they're doing?  - Pigs. For a sapper's fire.

812
01:39:54,333 --> 01:39:57,375
- Sappers?  - They're digging a mine underneath us.

813
01:39:57,500 --> 01:40:00,375
Pig's fat, it burns, with the heat of a crucible.

814
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:03,167
Make Way!

815
01:40:04,542 --> 01:40:06,833
Go on! Go!

816
01:40:12,042 --> 01:40:13,292
Whoa there!

817
01:40:15,667 --> 01:40:18,042
Bring them in.

818
01:40:49,917 --> 01:40:52,083
We've got a bigger problem.

819
01:40:53,542 --> 01:40:55,792
Hah! Get in there!

820
01:40:55,917 --> 01:40:57,792
Go on!

821
01:41:41,667 --> 01:41:43,792
Coteral.

822
01:41:46,458 --> 01:41:48,583
It's hot.

823
01:41:48,667 --> 01:41:52,167
So what are we gonna do now? Templar.

824
01:41:52,292 --> 01:41:54,417
We get to the other side of the keep.

825
01:42:06,667 --> 01:42:09,583
Guy, take the women to the chapel, huh?

826
01:42:09,708 --> 01:42:10,958
Go!

827
01:42:11,042 --> 01:42:14,292
Hurry, Isabel.

828
01:42:32,667 --> 01:42:34,958
Get down! Get down!

829
01:43:28,375 --> 01:43:31,625
- I think he's gone.  - I'm not making that mistake again.

830
01:43:31,750 --> 01:43:33,500
Come on.

831
01:43:38,208 --> 01:43:40,958
OK. One, two.

832
01:43:53,792 --> 01:43:56,583
Oh, Maddy. She was beside me.

833
01:44:06,792 --> 01:44:08,792
Becket. Becket.

834
01:44:15,583 --> 01:44:17,208
I'll hold them off.

835
01:44:17,292 --> 01:44:20,042
How much did they pay to get you out those stocks?

836
01:44:20,125 --> 01:44:23,667
- Five shillings.  - That is cheaper than a whore.

837
01:44:31,208 --> 01:44:34,500
Come on, you filthy whores!

838
01:44:48,292 --> 01:44:51,667
If they get through us, you kill the women.

839
01:44:51,750 --> 01:44:53,667
- No.  - Say it.

840
01:44:53,792 --> 01:44:55,833
- I can't.  - Say it!

841
01:44:57,292 --> 01:44:58,542
I'll kill the women.

842
01:45:04,042 --> 01:45:09,458
Come on, you whore! 

843
01:46:49,125 --> 01:46:51,375
Forgive me.

844
01:46:56,167 --> 01:46:58,292
Thomas. Thomas!

845
01:47:04,083 --> 01:47:05,333
Thomas!

846
01:47:23,333 --> 01:47:25,750
Save her.

847
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:35,625
No one touch him!

848
01:47:35,708 --> 01:47:37,458
How's your faith now, Templar?

849
01:47:37,583 --> 01:47:39,708
Why don't you come a little closer...

850
01:47:42,250 --> 01:47:44,250
and I'll show you.

851
01:51:33,458 --> 01:51:35,458
You fought bravely.

852
01:51:37,667 --> 01:51:39,417
Is killing a noble thing?

853
01:51:42,708 --> 01:51:48,000
But a life fought for others is a life worth living.

854
01:51:49,083 --> 01:51:51,625
That is a noble thing.

855
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:21,500
A French prince now holds the English crown.

856
01:52:24,833 --> 01:52:26,458
Not an easy decision to make.

857
01:52:27,625 --> 01:52:29,125
Nor was this one.

858
01:52:30,167 --> 01:52:32,042
The Order's over for you, Thomas.

859
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:36,333
You've earned your freedom as much as any man.

860
01:52:36,458 --> 01:52:38,083
Your Grace.

861
01:52:39,958 --> 01:52:41,583
Come on.

862
01:52:51,625 --> 01:52:53,583
We held.

863
01:53:11,417 --> 01:53:14,542
Within a year, the rebellion was won.

864
01:53:14,667 --> 01:53:20,333
While fleeing for his life, King John died of dysentery.

865
01:53:20,458 --> 01:53:23,958
What was left of his treasure was never recovered.

866
01:53:25,958 --> 01:53:29,625
In time, the great keep of Rochester was rebuilt.

867
01:53:29,750 --> 01:53:31,375
It stands to this day.

868
01:53:32,250 --> 01:53:37,125
So too does the noble dream that was... Magna Carta.
