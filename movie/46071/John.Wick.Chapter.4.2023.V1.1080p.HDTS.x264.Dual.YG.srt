1
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,052
I am the way,
into the city of the woe.

2
00:01:46,512 --> 00:01:50,385
I am the way, into eternal pain.

3
00:01:51,638 --> 00:01:53,959
I am the way
to go among the lost!

4
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:58,803
Before me,
there were no created things.

5
00:01:59,646 --> 00:02:02,940
But those that last forever.

6
00:02:04,597 --> 00:02:07,681
As do I!

7
00:02:08,966 --> 00:02:12,826
Abandon all hope,
you who are about to enter here.

8
00:02:17,483 --> 00:02:20,196
You are now in the presence,

9
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:23,955
of the motherfucking king!

10
00:02:43,587 --> 00:02:45,380
You ready, John?

11
00:02:51,402 --> 00:02:53,189
Yeah.

12
00:03:37,786 --> 00:03:38,786
Comrades! Comrades!

13
00:03:58,207 --> 00:03:59,553
You're worthless, John Wick!

14
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,291
- Oh, shit!
- Comrades!

15
00:04:31,315 --> 00:04:32,664
He's... He's right there.

16
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:56,905
Mr. Wick...

17
00:04:58,762 --> 00:05:00,509
To what do I owe the pleasure?

18
00:05:08,506 --> 00:05:11,318
My ring...

19
00:05:11,343 --> 00:05:14,029
My freedom...

20
00:05:15,812 --> 00:05:17,653
Your ring is gone...

21
00:05:17,677 --> 00:05:19,413
Like the Elder before me.

22
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,835
And if you came here thinking
you could end this by killing me,

23
00:05:24,859 --> 00:05:27,200
then you are mistaken.

24
00:05:27,924 --> 00:05:33,637
But that will not change the outcome,
any more than you can change your nature.

25
00:05:33,661 --> 00:05:37,014
None of us can escape who we are.

26
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,018
And no one escapes the Table.

27
00:05:41,295 --> 00:05:47,939
And the only way, John Wick, will ever
have freedom or peace, now or ever...

28
00:05:47,963 --> 00:05:49,503
is in death.

29
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,580
I know.

30
00:05:56,224 --> 00:06:00,205
I'm afraid, you've
come a very long way...

31
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:02,135
for nothing.

32
00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:07,039
Yeah...

33
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:11,122
Not really.

34
00:07:00,826 --> 00:07:02,312
The manager...

35
00:07:02,337 --> 00:07:03,752
Please.

36
00:07:12,796 --> 00:07:14,651
A harbinger...

37
00:07:14,675 --> 00:07:17,076
is here to see you, sir.

38
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,440
This must be a mistake.

39
00:07:19,464 --> 00:07:21,264
There is no mistake.

40
00:07:21,288 --> 00:07:25,408
By order of the Marquis,
Vincent Bisset de Gramont.

41
00:07:25,432 --> 00:07:28,512
This hotel has been condemned.

42
00:07:39,054 --> 00:07:41,574
You have one hour.

43
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,207
He is expecting you.

44
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,420
Can they do it, sir?

45
00:08:02,445 --> 00:08:06,713
The decree is signed by the
twelve members of the Table.

46
00:08:06,738 --> 00:08:10,751
Giving the Marquis,
the power of auto-imperato,

47
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:15,755
which means,
he is now our judge, jury, and...

48
00:08:18,261 --> 00:08:21,095
Evacuate the hotel.

49
00:08:37,978 --> 00:08:43,118
Ned Kelly's final words as the hangman
slipped the noose around his neck were...

50
00:08:44,201 --> 00:08:46,624
"Such is life"

51
00:08:46,648 --> 00:08:50,221
Can you imagine the acceptance?
The defiance?

52
00:08:50,245 --> 00:08:53,518
Today is not till the day you will die.

53
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:55,770
For that, I'm sure.

54
00:08:55,795 --> 00:09:01,495
You have the unshakeable faith of David,
my friend, but you shouldn't be here.

55
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,122
This will not be pleasant.

56
00:09:05,146 --> 00:09:07,286
Such is life, sir.

57
00:09:34,336 --> 00:09:37,622
My father, used to say...

58
00:09:37,646 --> 00:09:42,959
"How you do anything,
is how you do everything"

59
00:09:42,984 --> 00:09:46,904
Called it the first
and the last rule of life.

60
00:09:49,721 --> 00:09:52,280
You believe in rules...

61
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,770
Mr. Manager?

62
00:09:58,121 --> 00:10:00,587
Oh, I do.

63
00:10:01,011 --> 00:10:03,444
And without consequences?

64
00:10:04,754 --> 00:10:06,327
Of course.

65
00:10:08,203 --> 00:10:10,604
And second chances.

66
00:10:10,628 --> 00:10:12,037
Ah...

67
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:14,465
That's where we differ.

68
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,430
You and I.

69
00:10:19,127 --> 00:10:21,093
Second chances...

70
00:10:21,118 --> 00:10:25,144
are the refuge of men who failed.

71
00:10:56,715 --> 00:10:59,955
The others, on the Table,

72
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:05,803
who blame this atrocity,
on New York.

73
00:11:05,828 --> 00:11:08,556
They believe it's this city...

74
00:11:10,219 --> 00:11:15,428
The Table have indulged this,
fucking place for too long.

75
00:11:15,453 --> 00:11:17,982
And look where that has gotten us.

76
00:11:20,966 --> 00:11:22,379
I shot him.

77
00:11:23,302 --> 00:11:25,789
He lives...

78
00:11:25,813 --> 00:11:27,813
Polluting everything he touches.

79
00:11:27,837 --> 00:11:30,390
Marquis, respectfully,
my hotel...

80
00:11:30,414 --> 00:11:32,710
Your hotel?

81
00:11:34,013 --> 00:11:35,555
If...

82
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:37,407
I might, sir.

83
00:11:44,717 --> 00:11:45,997
By all means.

84
00:11:49,295 --> 00:11:53,815
The Continentals and The Management
are...

85
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,059
...a reminder to all who
sit beneath the Table,

86
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:00,005
That none of us are above the rules.

87
00:12:02,582 --> 00:12:05,189
Yet we are here.

88
00:12:05,213 --> 00:12:06,501
Sir, Mr. Wick...

89
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:09,013
We're not here
because of John Wick!

90
00:12:13,311 --> 00:12:16,851
He is simply the
face of your failure, Mr. Manager.

91
00:12:21,568 --> 00:12:27,414
Sand in that glass is merely
an echo of my remaining patience.

92
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:59,253
You are no longer New York.

93
00:13:02,504 --> 00:13:04,790
You are nothing.

94
00:13:06,434 --> 00:13:09,207
You are excommunicado.

95
00:13:10,424 --> 00:13:12,184
And as such...

96
00:13:14,554 --> 00:13:17,514
You no longer need
the services of a concierge.

97
00:13:43,744 --> 00:13:47,454
It has been an honor...

98
00:13:47,478 --> 00:13:49,063
my friend.

99
00:13:58,626 --> 00:14:02,026
Should've been me.

100
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,288
Yes...

101
00:14:04,313 --> 00:14:06,634
But it wasn't.

102
00:14:06,658 --> 00:14:08,558
Now, you think about why that is.

103
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:13,009
And perhaps, one of us would have
benefited from this conversation.

104
00:14:15,635 --> 00:14:18,501
Bring me Caine.

105
00:15:46,053 --> 00:15:48,307
I have a name for you.

106
00:15:48,331 --> 00:15:50,428
Respectfully...

107
00:15:50,453 --> 00:15:52,492
I'm retired.

108
00:15:52,516 --> 00:15:55,595
Finished, done.

109
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,998
I disagree.

110
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:01,258
I'm no use to you...

111
00:16:01,282 --> 00:16:02,990
or the Table.

112
00:16:03,647 --> 00:16:06,308
That's not for you to decide.

113
00:16:12,241 --> 00:16:14,595
I think you should find someone else.

114
00:16:19,132 --> 00:16:21,741
You came close...

115
00:16:21,765 --> 00:16:23,525
today.

116
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,152
Too close.

117
00:16:25,177 --> 00:16:27,918
You put her in danger.

118
00:16:39,848 --> 00:16:41,848
I know the deal I made.

119
00:16:53,457 --> 00:16:55,859
A former associate, I believe.

120
00:16:59,789 --> 00:17:02,119
He was...

121
00:17:04,749 --> 00:17:07,722
And a friend.

122
00:17:13,036 --> 00:17:16,949
The agreement with
the Table stays the same.

123
00:17:16,974 --> 00:17:18,721
We give you a name,

124
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,429
you give us a life.

125
00:17:20,453 --> 00:17:22,670
Or...

126
00:17:22,695 --> 00:17:24,477
We take one.

127
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,173
I will serve.

128
00:17:47,075 --> 00:17:50,010
I will be of service.

129
00:17:52,461 --> 00:17:54,090
Excellent!

130
00:17:58,753 --> 00:18:01,373
I assume you have a notion
of where he might be.

131
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:08,781
John Wick has few friends
remaining in the world.

132
00:18:08,805 --> 00:18:11,605
And even fewer, he trusts...

133
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,218
...with his life.

134
00:18:17,255 --> 00:18:18,874
Very, very bad.

135
00:19:08,887 --> 00:19:11,008
Welcome to the Osaka Continental.

136
00:19:11,033 --> 00:19:12,083
How can I help you?

137
00:19:12,108 --> 00:19:13,589
Yeah, I'm looking for a room.

138
00:19:17,292 --> 00:19:19,759
I'm afraid, this facility
doesn't allow animals.

139
00:19:21,836 --> 00:19:23,164
Emotional Support Animal.

140
00:19:23,188 --> 00:19:24,502
She's your support animal?

141
00:19:24,526 --> 00:19:26,432
Other way around, I'm hers.

142
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:29,072
Isn't that right?

143
00:19:33,562 --> 00:19:34,808
She stays in your room.

144
00:19:38,784 --> 00:19:40,038
Enjoy your stay, sir.

145
00:19:46,955 --> 00:19:49,783
<i>OPEN CONTRACT
JOHN WICK - $18 MILLION USD</i>

146
00:19:49,807 --> 00:19:51,940
Not too bad...

147
00:19:51,964 --> 00:19:53,648
Not bad at all.

148
00:20:07,985 --> 00:20:10,324
There is a dog in my lobby.

149
00:20:10,348 --> 00:20:11,821
Emotional Support Animal.

150
00:20:11,846 --> 00:20:13,821
Course it is.

151
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:15,105
Tomorrow's schedule...

152
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,999
Mr. Suzuki, at eleven, and the Tarasovs
are requesting an audience of two.

153
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:20,810
What's this at 8?

154
00:20:20,835 --> 00:20:21,945
Dinner with your daughter.

155
00:20:21,969 --> 00:20:24,870
She says, she's concerned
you've been working too hard.

156
00:20:26,007 --> 00:20:30,391
What must I have done to
deserve such a considerate child.

157
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,130
Good karma, I suppose.

158
00:20:32,155 --> 00:20:33,577
Indeed.

159
00:20:33,601 --> 00:20:35,601
How are our guests?

160
00:20:36,317 --> 00:20:39,715
Ah, some of our gold club
members are anxious.

161
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,749
It's always something.

162
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:43,648
Today, it's New York.

163
00:20:43,673 --> 00:20:47,278
- And my concierge?
- Concerned.

164
00:20:47,303 --> 00:20:51,356
Perhaps, we should get you an
Emotional Support Animal.

165
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,586
Should we worry?

166
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,541
We've done nothing to offend the Table.

167
00:20:59,566 --> 00:21:01,600
His relationship with
Mr. Wick is no secret.

168
00:21:01,624 --> 00:21:02,837
The Table will come.

169
00:21:04,728 --> 00:21:07,521
- Just finished, master.
- And...

170
00:21:07,546 --> 00:21:10,446
We'll be met with our grace.

171
00:21:10,471 --> 00:21:12,511
Everything he touches dies.

172
00:21:15,793 --> 00:21:19,325
Don't you dare speak to me
about a man that I've known...

173
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,657
since before you were born.

174
00:21:21,682 --> 00:21:24,315
Forgive me, father.

175
00:21:27,605 --> 00:21:29,891
Akira...

176
00:21:32,016 --> 00:21:36,178
Please tell my daughter,
that I look forward to our dinner.

177
00:21:54,433 --> 00:21:57,394
Don't let anyone in.

178
00:22:20,418 --> 00:22:23,527
I assume you are finally at peace.

179
00:22:40,044 --> 00:22:43,096
Apparently not.

180
00:22:43,121 --> 00:22:47,014
Killing the Elder was a mistake, my friend.

181
00:22:49,318 --> 00:22:54,390
Their response was the destruction
of the New York Continental.

182
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,341
My daughter fears we are next.

183
00:22:58,584 --> 00:22:59,933
Winston?

184
00:22:59,957 --> 00:23:00,965
Alive...

185
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:04,543
But they executed his concierge.

186
00:23:04,567 --> 00:23:07,640
To prove a point.

187
00:23:18,585 --> 00:23:22,865
Have you given any thought,
where this ends?

188
00:23:28,213 --> 00:23:30,213
The Table will never stop.

189
00:23:32,069 --> 00:23:33,230
You know this.

190
00:23:37,154 --> 00:23:40,054
It only takes life...

191
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:42,780
And only gives death.

192
00:23:48,189 --> 00:23:49,769
Koji...

193
00:23:52,065 --> 00:23:55,166
I am very sorry...

194
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:57,446
for the inconvenience.

195
00:23:59,255 --> 00:24:03,096
Friendship means little
when it's convenient.

196
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:55,239
Welcome to the Osaka Continental.
How can I help?

197
00:24:55,263 --> 00:24:56,666
The manager...

198
00:24:58,991 --> 00:25:00,831
Please.

199
00:25:03,287 --> 00:25:05,474
Of course.

200
00:25:05,499 --> 00:25:07,038
Please, make
yourself comfortable.

201
00:25:10,832 --> 00:25:12,407
Evacuate everyone...

202
00:25:12,431 --> 00:25:16,158
discreetly.

203
00:25:17,554 --> 00:25:21,675
The path this leads to, is death.

204
00:25:24,044 --> 00:25:26,044
I'm going to kill them all.

205
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,646
I believe you'll try,

206
00:25:29,671 --> 00:25:34,191
but no one, not even you,
can kill everyone.

207
00:25:36,794 --> 00:25:38,849
You want to die?

208
00:25:38,873 --> 00:25:42,007
That's your choice.

209
00:25:42,031 --> 00:25:46,931
A good death,
only come after a good life.

210
00:25:47,762 --> 00:25:52,615
You and I left a good life behind
a long time ago, my friend.

211
00:25:57,259 --> 00:25:59,260
Father! The High Table.

212
00:26:00,877 --> 00:26:02,592
What is he doing here?

213
00:26:02,617 --> 00:26:04,317
Mr. Wick is our guest.

214
00:26:05,128 --> 00:26:06,372
You fucked up.

215
00:26:06,397 --> 00:26:07,581
I'll talk to them.

216
00:26:07,606 --> 00:26:09,347
They don't know you're here.

217
00:26:09,371 --> 00:26:11,891
- Please.
- Stay, with Mr. Wick.

218
00:26:21,214 --> 00:26:22,800
We have guests...

219
00:26:22,825 --> 00:26:25,839
Be ready to show
them hospitality.

220
00:26:51,356 --> 00:26:55,335
Welcome to the
Osaka Continental, gentlemen.

221
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:57,525
How may I be of service?

222
00:26:58,302 --> 00:27:03,203
The Table has reason to believe
that this facility is providing services...

223
00:27:03,227 --> 00:27:04,541
to somebody who was...

224
00:27:04,565 --> 00:27:06,619
<font color="#ff0000">Excommunicado</font>.

225
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:10,956
That is a grave accusation.

226
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,066
We will require full access to your hotel.

227
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,796
Of course...

228
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,483
But as you're well aware...

229
00:27:18,507 --> 00:27:20,460
No business...

230
00:27:20,484 --> 00:27:25,604
Not even your kind of business,
may be conducted on Continental grounds.

231
00:27:25,628 --> 00:27:31,289
So, I'm going to have to ask you
to surrender your firearms.

232
00:27:32,413 --> 00:27:34,425
We speak for the Marquis.

233
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:37,216
And I speak for Osaka.

234
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,973
Your guns...

235
00:27:38,997 --> 00:27:41,446
Please.

236
00:27:42,143 --> 00:27:46,050
Don't repeat the mistake
that fool in New York made.

237
00:27:46,074 --> 00:27:49,040
Fools talk, cowards are silent,

238
00:27:49,065 --> 00:27:51,940
but wise men listen.

239
00:27:51,964 --> 00:27:54,277
So which one will you be?

240
00:28:04,154 --> 00:28:05,627
Hello...

241
00:28:05,651 --> 00:28:07,239
Old friend.

242
00:28:09,342 --> 00:28:14,122
So good of you to visit,
after all these years.

243
00:28:14,147 --> 00:28:17,482
- You are with them, now.
- No...

244
00:28:18,899 --> 00:28:19,872
No.

245
00:28:19,896 --> 00:28:22,877
Your daughter, Mia?

246
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,361
Alive.

247
00:28:27,285 --> 00:28:29,078
And your daughter, Akira?

248
00:28:30,715 --> 00:28:32,064
Well.

249
00:28:33,608 --> 00:28:36,087
I'm glad.

250
00:28:37,431 --> 00:28:40,599
You know...

251
00:28:40,623 --> 00:28:42,731
We don't have to
end this with blood.

252
00:28:44,648 --> 00:28:46,453
Then, leave.

253
00:28:46,478 --> 00:28:48,060
No one defies the Table.

254
00:28:48,085 --> 00:28:50,271
I remember once you understood that.

255
00:28:50,296 --> 00:28:54,759
And I remember a time, when you
understood the meaning of brotherhood.

256
00:28:54,784 --> 00:28:56,715
Enough!

257
00:28:56,739 --> 00:29:02,015
By order of the Marquis de Gramont,
this hotel has been deconsecrated.

258
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:03,486
Step aside.

259
00:29:19,374 --> 00:29:21,857
Don't do this, Koji.

260
00:29:30,827 --> 00:29:33,239
Sorry.

261
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:43,821
Attack!

262
00:29:58,598 --> 00:30:00,064
Kill them all!

263
00:30:51,342 --> 00:30:53,065
Get out!

264
00:31:09,609 --> 00:31:12,129
Stand down.

265
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,566
Secure the hotel.

266
00:31:18,591 --> 00:31:20,199
Find Wick.

267
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:28,229
You have no right to be here.

268
00:31:28,254 --> 00:31:31,673
If they find you here,
the Table will kill my father...

269
00:31:31,697 --> 00:31:33,697
Me...

270
00:31:33,721 --> 00:31:36,040
Everyone, because you broke the rules.

271
00:31:37,711 --> 00:31:40,804
You shouldn't have come.

272
00:31:52,754 --> 00:31:55,127
The hotel is under attack.

273
00:32:03,268 --> 00:32:04,494
You armed?

274
00:33:15,045 --> 00:33:17,278
- Let's go.
- Yes.

275
00:33:21,206 --> 00:33:23,519
- Stop them.
- Mhm.

276
00:34:10,656 --> 00:34:12,310
Hey!

277
00:34:12,334 --> 00:34:14,829
Blind man!

278
00:34:14,854 --> 00:34:16,747
Do your job!

279
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:30,348
Akira!

280
00:38:45,288 --> 00:38:46,815
Can you stand up?

281
00:38:48,972 --> 00:38:50,432
Get out the way you came.

282
00:38:50,456 --> 00:38:51,862
Go to the Umeda station.

283
00:38:51,886 --> 00:38:52,869
I'll stay.

284
00:38:52,894 --> 00:38:55,583
Don't insult my gift to you.

285
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,280
And John,

286
00:38:59,304 --> 00:39:01,525
do me a small courtesy.

287
00:39:01,549 --> 00:39:04,215
Kill as many as you can.

288
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:05,912
Promise.

289
00:44:23,188 --> 00:44:24,804
John.

290
00:44:25,608 --> 00:44:27,484
Caine.

291
00:44:35,979 --> 00:44:39,379
They gave you my name.

292
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:42,756
Yeah.

293
00:44:45,532 --> 00:44:48,169
I'm sorry.

294
00:44:49,146 --> 00:44:50,533
Me too.

295
00:45:12,197 --> 00:45:15,146
You should have stayed out!

296
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:18,413
For all our sakes.

297
00:45:18,437 --> 00:45:20,333
I tried.

298
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:24,323
Did you?

299
00:45:57,953 --> 00:45:59,170
Come on, John.

300
00:46:02,128 --> 00:46:03,730
Let's get this shit over with.

301
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,038
Yeah...

302
00:46:09,062 --> 00:46:11,218
That sounds like a good idea.

303
00:46:27,802 --> 00:46:29,349
You took a deal.

304
00:46:31,518 --> 00:46:33,815
Same as you, John.

305
00:46:36,632 --> 00:46:37,748
Family?

306
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:42,885
Family.

307
00:47:11,849 --> 00:47:15,010
You dead, John?

308
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,586
John.

309
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:55,193
Caine.

310
00:49:45,698 --> 00:49:47,718
Damn, Johnny.

311
00:49:47,743 --> 00:49:50,471
This is quite the mess you've made.

312
00:49:50,496 --> 00:49:52,286
I don't know you.

313
00:49:52,311 --> 00:49:53,580
But I know you.

314
00:50:01,183 --> 00:50:03,479
You a tracker?

315
00:50:08,515 --> 00:50:09,962
How much?

316
00:50:13,032 --> 00:50:15,032
Not enough.

317
00:50:17,221 --> 00:50:18,303
But it's getting there.

318
00:50:24,513 --> 00:50:27,187
I need you to take
better care of yourself, John.

319
00:50:29,143 --> 00:50:32,309
Cause we're in this together, now.

320
00:51:15,426 --> 00:51:17,000
Alright, Koji.

321
00:51:21,231 --> 00:51:22,897
Just tell me where John is...

322
00:51:22,922 --> 00:51:25,437
and get out of here.

323
00:51:25,461 --> 00:51:27,521
Leave!

324
00:51:27,545 --> 00:51:31,933
Go somewhere, far away.

325
00:51:31,958 --> 00:51:34,954
You know, I won't.

326
00:51:42,004 --> 00:51:44,817
Did they shoot you?

327
00:52:02,675 --> 00:52:04,476
You owe John Wick nothing.

328
00:52:07,513 --> 00:52:09,773
He has no marker on you.

329
00:52:16,021 --> 00:52:19,102
You mustn't have fallen far to believe,

330
00:52:19,127 --> 00:52:22,647
the only debts we have,

331
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:25,469
lie in markers.

332
00:52:30,892 --> 00:52:34,518
Come on...

333
00:52:34,543 --> 00:52:36,259
I don't want to do this.

334
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:23,650
Father!

335
00:53:39,286 --> 00:53:41,860
Look at me.

336
00:53:48,804 --> 00:53:51,778
Even a blind man knows you've lost.

337
00:53:53,648 --> 00:53:55,446
Caine.

338
00:53:56,633 --> 00:54:00,156
You don't need eyes
to see the right path.

339
00:54:03,813 --> 00:54:06,040
Just take care of your daughter.

340
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:09,877
I...

341
00:54:12,187 --> 00:54:13,378
I am.

342
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:21,174
No.

343
00:54:59,055 --> 00:55:00,168
Don't!

344
00:55:02,725 --> 00:55:04,285
Live.

345
00:55:25,982 --> 00:55:27,982
I'll be waiting for you.

346
00:56:40,266 --> 00:56:41,971
Who is he?

347
00:56:48,535 --> 00:56:50,733
He was a friend.

348
00:56:52,343 --> 00:56:54,657
My father has died because of you.

349
00:56:57,734 --> 00:57:00,073
Because of what you've done.

350
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:07,336
So either you kill him...

351
00:57:07,361 --> 00:57:09,041
or I will.

352
00:57:15,776 --> 00:57:17,544
I understand.

353
00:57:37,728 --> 00:57:40,004
Goodbye...

354
00:57:40,028 --> 00:57:43,066
Mr. Wick.

355
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:06,990
Thanks for coming.

356
00:58:07,015 --> 00:58:11,468
Well, us homeless folk do
have to stick together now, though.

357
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:17,858
I need, to speak with him.

358
00:58:19,575 --> 00:58:25,280
Last time, you spoke to him,
you shot him off a roof.

359
00:58:25,305 --> 00:58:27,232
Had no choice.

360
00:58:27,256 --> 00:58:29,256
They hold all the cards.

361
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,309
No...

362
00:58:31,333 --> 00:58:32,933
But who held the gun?

363
00:58:32,957 --> 00:58:35,930
John needs to know the threat
of what's coming at him.

364
00:58:35,954 --> 00:58:39,727
This Marquis is unrestrained;
The Table has let him off the leash.

365
00:58:39,751 --> 00:58:44,764
Oh, my dear Winston.
Your benevolence is touching.

366
00:58:45,947 --> 00:58:48,701
But tell me, tell me true...

367
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:51,751
Why did the Frenchman let you live?

368
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:55,361
Killing a man can
turn him into a martyr.

369
00:58:55,385 --> 00:58:58,171
Letting him live...

370
00:58:58,196 --> 00:59:01,869
tells the world that
he's a coward or a turncoat.

371
00:59:04,939 --> 00:59:07,233
So what are you?

372
00:59:08,692 --> 00:59:10,878
Aggrieved.

373
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:35,542
I fail to see how laying waste
to the Continentals...

374
00:59:35,567 --> 00:59:38,320
is getting you closer
to killing John Wick.

375
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:42,294
This campaign is not to kill John Wick.

376
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:45,978
It is to kill the idea,
of John Wick.

377
00:59:46,003 --> 00:59:47,518
And to do that...

378
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:50,738
I must destroy everything
that idea touches.

379
00:59:55,894 --> 00:59:59,376
The bloodshed in Osaka,
was not necessary.

380
01:00:00,892 --> 01:00:04,680
The bloodshed, was the point.

381
01:00:19,695 --> 01:00:21,776
He'll make it your choice.

382
01:00:29,381 --> 01:00:30,350
You.

383
01:00:30,375 --> 01:00:32,810
Come with me.

384
01:00:32,834 --> 01:00:35,087
Think twice before accepting.

385
01:00:41,575 --> 01:00:43,604
And you are?!

386
01:00:43,628 --> 01:00:45,628
Nobody.

387
01:00:46,931 --> 01:00:48,810
Kindness...

388
01:00:48,834 --> 01:00:50,643
Mr. Nobody...

389
01:00:50,667 --> 01:00:53,777
is a pathetic trait.

390
01:00:53,801 --> 01:00:55,454
A miscalculation...

391
01:00:55,478 --> 01:01:00,624
in which by trying to hide our ego,
we let it appear stark naked.

392
01:01:03,527 --> 01:01:06,127
I will ask only once.

393
01:01:10,622 --> 01:01:13,108
How are you able to locate him?

394
01:01:14,998 --> 01:01:17,351
Pay and I'll tell you.

395
01:01:22,608 --> 01:01:25,549
How much,
would such a service be worth?

396
01:01:25,573 --> 01:01:27,007
$25 million.

397
01:01:27,039 --> 01:01:30,027
Plus a metric
contribution to my 401K...

398
01:01:30,052 --> 01:01:31,161
when he's dead.

399
01:01:34,784 --> 01:01:36,438
We found him once.

400
01:01:36,462 --> 01:01:37,577
We'll find him again.

401
01:01:37,602 --> 01:01:41,102
Is that before or after
he puts you in your ground?

402
01:01:48,019 --> 01:01:50,019
I like you.

403
01:01:52,908 --> 01:01:54,385
$20 million.

404
01:01:58,315 --> 01:02:01,061
If I could get some more.

405
01:02:01,086 --> 01:02:03,541
$23M

406
01:02:03,565 --> 01:02:06,665
Ego. Hm, Mr. Nobody.

407
01:02:06,689 --> 01:02:08,722
It's $23M.

408
01:02:08,746 --> 01:02:11,286
You clearly couldn't afford it.

409
01:02:18,496 --> 01:02:20,496
For the service?

410
01:02:22,094 --> 01:02:25,481
Aah, fuck!

411
01:02:27,784 --> 01:02:28,672
No, no, no, no.

412
01:02:28,696 --> 01:02:30,222
No, it's okay.
Really, it's okay.

413
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:31,609
Sit! Sit!

414
01:02:34,953 --> 01:02:37,138
What the fuck is this, man?

415
01:02:37,163 --> 01:02:39,326
A choice.

416
01:02:39,350 --> 01:02:41,823
You could pull the knife out, or...

417
01:02:41,847 --> 01:02:43,940
you could pull your hand out.

418
01:02:43,965 --> 01:02:46,820
One shows me a man,
committed only to himself.

419
01:02:46,844 --> 01:02:48,407
And the other...

420
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:51,650
A man committed to the cause.

421
01:02:51,675 --> 01:02:52,855
Which one are you?

422
01:03:36,747 --> 01:03:38,345
Happy hunting.

423
01:04:27,748 --> 01:04:29,749
Winston.

424
01:04:29,773 --> 01:04:32,021
Jonathan.

425
01:04:32,845 --> 01:04:36,074
My condolences.

426
01:04:36,098 --> 01:04:38,304
He was a good man.

427
01:04:39,741 --> 01:04:42,006
Yes, he was.

428
01:04:42,031 --> 01:04:45,000
Taken for our sins.

429
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:55,389
Who is this?

430
01:04:56,832 --> 01:04:59,172
The Marquis de Gramont.

431
01:04:59,197 --> 01:05:03,138
Elevated only by his guarantee,
of killing you.

432
01:05:03,162 --> 01:05:06,595
All the resources of
the Table are at his disposal.

433
01:05:07,686 --> 01:05:10,264
Where do I find him?

434
01:05:10,288 --> 01:05:12,628
Paris.

435
01:05:16,285 --> 01:05:19,217
Where will it end?

436
01:05:19,241 --> 01:05:20,671
Huh?

437
01:05:21,755 --> 01:05:24,008
With him dead.

438
01:05:24,032 --> 01:05:25,201
Oh?

439
01:05:25,225 --> 01:05:27,491
And then?

440
01:05:27,515 --> 01:05:29,165
Hm?

441
01:05:29,189 --> 01:05:33,363
Have you learned, nothing?!

442
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:36,760
They will replace him
before the body's cold.

443
01:05:36,784 --> 01:05:39,710
Hercules had his Hydra...
You have the Table,

444
01:05:39,735 --> 01:05:43,034
except you'll run out of bullets
before they run out of heads.

445
01:05:47,437 --> 01:05:50,901
Kill him or do it the smart way.

446
01:05:50,926 --> 01:05:53,141
And get him to give you your freedom.

447
01:05:55,438 --> 01:05:56,731
How?

448
01:05:56,755 --> 01:05:59,668
Turn his rules and
consequences against him.

449
01:05:59,692 --> 01:06:02,725
Challenge him to single combat.

450
01:06:03,828 --> 01:06:06,882
High Table duels are a myth.

451
01:06:06,906 --> 01:06:08,586
Wrong!

452
01:06:08,610 --> 01:06:11,576
They're a cold hard fact.

453
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,806
And part of the foundation of the Table.

454
01:06:13,831 --> 01:06:17,560
To stop its small combustible
members from outright war.

455
01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:21,843
It's also, win or lose.

456
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:26,553
What you say you want...

457
01:06:26,578 --> 01:06:28,560
a way out.

458
01:06:32,204 --> 01:06:34,648
I don't sit at the Table.

459
01:06:34,672 --> 01:06:37,045
Your family does.

460
01:06:37,075 --> 01:06:41,482
Get them to issue a challenge
and then, offer you up as proxy.

461
01:06:41,506 --> 01:06:43,664
I don't have a family.

462
01:06:43,689 --> 01:06:46,673
The Ruska Roma tore my ticket.

463
01:06:47,919 --> 01:06:52,578
Then I suggest you
get your ass to Berlin...

464
01:06:52,602 --> 01:06:54,662
and get it mended.

465
01:06:54,686 --> 01:06:58,235
Or...

466
01:06:58,259 --> 01:06:59,765
Pick a plot.

467
01:07:02,082 --> 01:07:05,768
What do you get out of this, Winston?

468
01:07:05,792 --> 01:07:08,878
With you is so good at getting, Jonathan...

469
01:07:08,902 --> 01:07:11,025
Revenge.

470
01:08:01,016 --> 01:08:03,684
Nice revolver...

471
01:08:03,709 --> 01:08:05,655
Classic.

472
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:11,109
Is that all?

473
01:08:30,567 --> 01:08:32,008
Father...

474
01:08:32,032 --> 01:08:33,755
Yes?

475
01:08:33,779 --> 01:08:34,875
My son?

476
01:08:34,899 --> 01:08:36,899
I need to talk to Uncle Pyotr.

477
01:08:49,704 --> 01:08:51,825
Nice suit.

478
01:09:07,571 --> 01:09:09,258
Speak...

479
01:09:09,282 --> 01:09:10,308
He's in Berlin.

480
01:09:10,333 --> 01:09:12,285
At the Ruska Roma.

481
01:09:12,310 --> 01:09:14,359
You can wire that finder's fee, now.

482
01:09:14,383 --> 01:09:16,178
No.

483
01:09:16,202 --> 01:09:17,808
Excuse me?

484
01:09:17,833 --> 01:09:20,522
Kill John Wick,
then you'll get your money.

485
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:23,559
That wasn't part of our deal.

486
01:09:24,939 --> 01:09:27,792
The deal was for your service.

487
01:09:28,562 --> 01:09:32,188
And it's our life for life, Mr. Nobody.

488
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,706
Yours...

489
01:09:35,731 --> 01:09:37,939
or his?

490
01:09:37,963 --> 01:09:41,016
When it's done,
you'll have your prize...

491
01:09:41,041 --> 01:09:42,729
and your pension.

492
01:09:51,593 --> 01:09:53,116
Asshole.

493
01:10:14,785 --> 01:10:17,521
The prodigal son returns...

494
01:10:21,062 --> 01:10:24,656
But this isn't your home anymore, is it?

495
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:26,846
Jonathan Wick.

496
01:10:26,870 --> 01:10:30,500
You have grown, Katia.

497
01:10:30,850 --> 01:10:33,044
And you got old.

498
01:10:33,068 --> 01:10:36,011
Of course, it has been a long time.

499
01:10:36,035 --> 01:10:38,785
I need to talk to him.

500
01:10:43,468 --> 01:10:45,172
You are forgetting...

501
01:10:45,196 --> 01:10:48,065
We are still under the Table.

502
01:10:48,089 --> 01:10:50,382
And last, I checked...

503
01:10:50,986 --> 01:10:56,505
You are excommunicado,
and your ticket, was torn.

504
01:10:57,362 --> 01:11:00,668
You have no business, with us.

505
01:11:01,458 --> 01:11:03,458
That's for Pyotr to decide.

506
01:11:03,482 --> 01:11:05,845
Pyotr is dead!

507
01:11:09,961 --> 01:11:11,893
After you...

508
01:11:11,917 --> 01:11:14,103
put a bullet in the Elder's head.

509
01:11:15,786 --> 01:11:18,546
The Marquis had one put in Pyotr's head.

510
01:11:19,535 --> 01:11:21,708
And in fine Russian tradition...

511
01:11:23,605 --> 01:11:25,951
he sent us the bill.

512
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:33,148
Because of you, I had to kneel in
front of the man who murdered my father.

513
01:11:33,172 --> 01:11:37,426
Then, we have, a common enemy.

514
01:11:38,402 --> 01:11:41,756
We can help each other.

515
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:45,826
You can't even help yourself.

516
01:11:45,851 --> 01:11:48,256
How the hell are
you going to help us?

517
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:51,453
By, killing this Marquis.

518
01:11:51,977 --> 01:11:53,807
They just appoint another.

519
01:11:53,832 --> 01:11:56,401
His death changes <font color="#ff0000">NOTHING</font>.

520
01:11:58,830 --> 01:12:02,796
It does,
if I kill him in a duel!

521
01:12:17,126 --> 01:12:19,614
The traditions are clear on this...

522
01:12:19,639 --> 01:12:23,532
but for a duel to be
approved by The Table...

523
01:12:23,556 --> 01:12:27,556
he would have to be
a member of a family...

524
01:12:27,581 --> 01:12:32,484
and have a crest.

525
01:12:43,812 --> 01:12:47,405
How many did you kill, to get out?

526
01:12:47,429 --> 01:12:49,025
A lot.

527
01:12:50,262 --> 01:12:54,208
You will only have to kill one,
to get back in.

528
01:12:54,232 --> 01:12:57,442
The bastard who murdered my father.

529
01:12:58,713 --> 01:13:01,329
Give me the name.

530
01:13:02,439 --> 01:13:04,396
Kill a Harkan.

531
01:13:04,421 --> 01:13:06,823
You will find him at Himmel & Hall.

532
01:13:06,848 --> 01:13:09,496
When he's dead,
I'll remend your ticket.

533
01:13:09,526 --> 01:13:10,811
And a crest!

534
01:13:12,114 --> 01:13:13,717
Harkan, first.

535
01:13:13,741 --> 01:13:15,391
Then, we talk.

536
01:13:15,416 --> 01:13:16,729
Bring proof of death.

537
01:13:20,299 --> 01:13:22,186
I'll need a way in.

538
01:13:24,772 --> 01:13:26,122
I know a way.

539
01:13:27,466 --> 01:13:28,795
Klaus will take you.

540
01:13:38,085 --> 01:13:40,105
I am Klaus.

541
01:13:44,255 --> 01:13:45,175
John.

542
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:47,281
I am Klaus!

543
01:14:34,925 --> 01:14:38,205
Please tell your mistress
that I am honored by this gesture

544
01:14:38,230 --> 01:14:41,619
and I look forward
to our continuing partnership.

545
01:14:42,409 --> 01:14:44,503
I am Klaus.

546
01:14:50,746 --> 01:14:53,992
Mr. John Wick,

547
01:14:54,016 --> 01:14:55,379
in the flesh.

548
01:14:56,935 --> 01:14:58,388
The Baba Yaga.

549
01:15:01,471 --> 01:15:02,864
Must be Christmas, ja?

550
01:15:14,241 --> 01:15:15,874
Where are my manners? Please.

551
01:15:21,890 --> 01:15:24,812
A drink, Mr. Wick?

552
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:29,295
You were expecting me.

553
01:15:29,319 --> 01:15:31,462
Not me...

554
01:15:31,486 --> 01:15:33,532
Him.

555
01:15:33,557 --> 01:15:34,886
John?

556
01:15:37,230 --> 01:15:38,771
How are you?

557
01:15:40,221 --> 01:15:42,221
You knew I'd be here.

558
01:15:42,245 --> 01:15:44,785
Oh, I suspected it.

559
01:15:44,809 --> 01:15:46,191
Family...

560
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:54,040
That family sold you out, Mr. Wick.

561
01:15:55,477 --> 01:15:59,377
They gave you up,
to find hope of saving themselves.

562
01:16:00,861 --> 01:16:02,947
You see that's why I
never trust the Cossacks.

563
01:16:02,972 --> 01:16:05,667
They are... dirty people.

564
01:16:08,851 --> 01:16:10,851
This is personal.

565
01:16:13,435 --> 01:16:15,735
I sense tension here.

566
01:16:16,765 --> 01:16:22,621
Mr. Wick may probably feel,
I'm responsible for the death of a...

567
01:16:22,645 --> 01:16:24,151
mutual friend.

568
01:16:27,348 --> 01:16:29,210
But I didn't kill Koji.

569
01:16:29,234 --> 01:16:31,115
You did, John.

570
01:16:32,778 --> 01:16:35,580
You know, this discord
between old friends...

571
01:16:35,604 --> 01:16:38,361
It saddens me.

572
01:16:38,385 --> 01:16:39,564
Allow me to help.

573
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:43,586
Nein!

574
01:16:44,633 --> 01:16:46,616
We have a deal.

575
01:16:48,626 --> 01:16:49,938
Who?

576
01:16:49,963 --> 01:16:51,712
The Marquis.

577
01:16:51,736 --> 01:16:55,409
I have to mind if it's bullets,
blades, or a blind man.

578
01:17:07,328 --> 01:17:09,588
We found someone outside.

579
01:17:16,224 --> 01:17:19,504
Is this for me, Mr...?

580
01:17:20,099 --> 01:17:22,009
Nobody.

581
01:17:23,090 --> 01:17:25,943
And, no.
That's actually for him.

582
01:17:30,073 --> 01:17:33,213
Then take a seat, Mr. Nobody.

583
01:17:37,270 --> 01:17:38,875
Exciting, ja?

584
01:17:48,674 --> 01:17:49,974
So...

585
01:17:49,998 --> 01:17:51,998
You want to kill him?

586
01:17:54,741 --> 01:17:57,195
You want to kill him?

587
01:17:57,219 --> 01:17:59,219
I want to kill him.

588
01:17:59,976 --> 01:18:02,363
What about you, Mr. Wick?

589
01:18:02,388 --> 01:18:04,833
I'm going to kill you.

590
01:18:05,703 --> 01:18:07,843
For Pyotr, of course. Ja?

591
01:18:09,547 --> 01:18:12,820
But it looks like we have ourselves a...

592
01:18:12,845 --> 01:18:15,778
a genuine conundrum.

593
01:18:15,802 --> 01:18:17,468
A quandary, if you will.

594
01:18:17,492 --> 01:18:19,195
A real life dilemma.

595
01:18:21,005 --> 01:18:22,198
So...

596
01:18:23,835 --> 01:18:26,035
I thought we'd play a game.

597
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:28,216
One hand.

598
01:18:28,241 --> 01:18:30,290
The winner decides who lives...

599
01:18:32,226 --> 01:18:33,940
and who does not.

600
01:18:38,844 --> 01:18:40,612
Alright.

601
01:18:40,637 --> 01:18:42,178
What's the buy-in?

602
01:18:42,203 --> 01:18:44,337
More than you can afford.

603
01:18:45,134 --> 01:18:48,241
Yeah, I'm one bullet away
from being a very rich man.

604
01:18:49,823 --> 01:18:51,878
Or a dead one.

605
01:18:53,282 --> 01:18:56,882
Five card draw.

606
01:19:20,093 --> 01:19:21,780
Mr. Wick?

607
01:19:22,296 --> 01:19:24,566
Mr. Wick?

608
01:19:46,838 --> 01:19:49,298
Dead Man's Hand, Mr. Wick.

609
01:19:52,928 --> 01:19:55,558
Well...

610
01:19:55,583 --> 01:19:57,583
I don't gamble.

611
01:19:59,814 --> 01:20:01,316
Let's see.

612
01:20:08,363 --> 01:20:10,824
Four 9s, and a 4.

613
01:20:10,848 --> 01:20:12,314
Most impressive.

614
01:20:24,788 --> 01:20:26,367
Ah!

615
01:20:26,391 --> 01:20:28,481
Royal Flush.

616
01:20:28,505 --> 01:20:30,385
Pretty good for a nobody.

617
01:20:30,410 --> 01:20:32,098
Thank you.

618
01:20:33,421 --> 01:20:34,959
A blind man,

619
01:20:34,984 --> 01:20:36,805
a guy with a dog,

620
01:20:36,830 --> 01:20:37,664
and John Wick,

621
01:20:37,689 --> 01:20:42,016
walk into a bar and
take a seat at the table.

622
01:20:42,627 --> 01:20:45,985
Does it sound like the beginning
of a stupendous joke

623
01:20:46,009 --> 01:20:48,599
or a most profitable opportunity?

624
01:20:50,756 --> 01:20:52,315
One...

625
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:54,822
thinks he can serve his way out.

626
01:20:59,192 --> 01:21:01,717
One...

627
01:21:01,742 --> 01:21:04,075
thinks he can buy his way out.

628
01:21:07,079 --> 01:21:09,778
And one...

629
01:21:09,803 --> 01:21:13,676
thinks he can kill...
his way out.

630
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:19,460
Each of them all think that
they have the winning hand...

631
01:21:20,770 --> 01:21:23,030
But what they fail...

632
01:21:23,054 --> 01:21:24,891
to realize...

633
01:21:24,916 --> 01:21:28,418
is that the moment,
they took a seat at the table.

634
01:21:31,521 --> 01:21:33,742
They had already lost.

635
01:21:33,767 --> 01:21:36,193
Let me guess... Five of a kind?

636
01:21:37,803 --> 01:21:39,100
Yeah.

637
01:21:39,124 --> 01:21:42,147
I knew you were a cheating jerk.

638
01:21:42,171 --> 01:21:45,073
Yeah... a complete jerk.

639
01:21:46,327 --> 01:21:48,502
Just so you know...

640
01:21:49,245 --> 01:21:51,891
Pyotr wasn't personal.

641
01:21:53,111 --> 01:21:54,364
Well, maybe a little bit.

642
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:58,981
Kill!

643
01:22:36,511 --> 01:22:37,691
Lights out, <font color="#ff0000">idiots</font>.

644
01:23:19,389 --> 01:23:21,200
Hey, out of the way!

645
01:24:02,465 --> 01:24:04,863
You shot me in the ass!

646
01:24:04,888 --> 01:24:05,888
<font color="#ff0000">Bastard!</font>

647
01:26:16,385 --> 01:26:18,120
Nut!

648
01:26:46,014 --> 01:26:49,131
You know what your problem is, Mr. Wick?

649
01:26:49,589 --> 01:26:51,988
You, are unlucky!

650
01:26:53,418 --> 01:26:55,518
Unlucky in life,

651
01:26:55,542 --> 01:26:57,137
in love,

652
01:26:57,161 --> 01:26:58,711
in friendship!

653
01:27:01,023 --> 01:27:03,823
And now...

654
01:27:03,847 --> 01:27:05,156
in death.

655
01:28:04,827 --> 01:28:05,922
Enough!

656
01:28:05,946 --> 01:28:07,427
Guys, end him!

657
01:28:55,837 --> 01:28:58,338
Why don't you just die?!

658
01:30:06,036 --> 01:30:08,036
He's mine.

659
01:30:09,359 --> 01:30:11,552
I told you not to take the deal.

660
01:30:11,576 --> 01:30:14,596
Yeah, I guess your deal
didn't work out either, huh?

661
01:30:14,621 --> 01:30:16,539
Huh?!

662
01:30:16,564 --> 01:30:19,239
How long it take for them
to take your eyes, though?

663
01:30:23,428 --> 01:30:25,787
They didn't take them.

664
01:30:26,994 --> 01:30:28,387
I gave them.

665
01:30:58,951 --> 01:31:01,305
You are a son of Belarus...

666
01:31:01,329 --> 01:31:04,262
an orphan of our tribe.

667
01:31:04,893 --> 01:31:07,972
You are tied to us, as we are to you...

668
01:31:07,996 --> 01:31:10,299
in this life and in the next.

669
01:31:17,835 --> 01:31:19,835
Your blood...

670
01:31:19,859 --> 01:31:21,505
is my blood.

671
01:31:21,648 --> 01:31:23,205
Your pain...

672
01:31:23,229 --> 01:31:25,672
is my pain.

673
01:31:26,682 --> 01:31:28,390
Your life...

674
01:31:28,414 --> 01:31:30,127
is my life.

675
01:31:50,231 --> 01:31:52,870
Welcome back, Jardani.

676
01:32:04,533 --> 01:32:09,383
The Ruska Roma will
support, your challenge.

677
01:32:09,408 --> 01:32:10,754
Who will be your second?

678
01:32:39,418 --> 01:32:42,211
A warning of the cost of tyranny.

679
01:32:45,807 --> 01:32:49,006
You must intend to join your concierge.

680
01:32:49,031 --> 01:32:51,212
Not today.

681
01:32:57,763 --> 01:33:02,446
Per the old ways and the old laws,
John Wick calls you to a duel.

682
01:33:02,470 --> 01:33:07,623
To settle your differences the
old-fashioned way, as gentlemen should.

683
01:33:09,206 --> 01:33:12,630
You speak of the old ways,
as if you know them.

684
01:33:12,654 --> 01:33:17,111
A man of Mr. Wick's station
cannot issue such a challenge.

685
01:33:18,268 --> 01:33:20,955
He has his family's crest.

686
01:33:25,072 --> 01:33:26,194
Berlin...

687
01:33:26,219 --> 01:33:27,391
Ruska Roma challenge,

688
01:33:27,416 --> 01:33:29,791
the acceptance of
Mr. Wick back into the fold,

689
01:33:29,816 --> 01:33:31,454
it's all there.

690
01:33:31,479 --> 01:33:34,402
Recorded history, now.

691
01:33:41,666 --> 01:33:44,919
And why would I accept this,
from a second royal seat.

692
01:33:44,944 --> 01:33:47,623
Because they were rules,
and without them...

693
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:49,423
We live with the animals.

694
01:33:49,447 --> 01:33:50,907
Exactly.

695
01:33:54,012 --> 01:33:56,258
Times are changing.

696
01:33:56,282 --> 01:33:57,845
A new day is dawning.

697
01:33:57,869 --> 01:33:59,352
New ideas.

698
01:33:59,376 --> 01:34:01,562
New rules.

699
01:34:01,586 --> 01:34:03,963
New management.

700
01:34:05,107 --> 01:34:07,466
Yet, you will accept.

701
01:34:07,491 --> 01:34:11,327
Because we all still sit beneath the Table.

702
01:34:11,351 --> 01:34:15,290
Even you are not immune
to the consequence of failure.

703
01:34:22,493 --> 01:34:26,183
And what exactly,
are Mr. Wick's terms.

704
01:34:26,208 --> 01:34:29,123
Victoria Falujai

705
01:34:29,148 --> 01:34:34,138
The unconditional release of any
and all obligations to the Table.

706
01:34:48,864 --> 01:34:54,125
History has been littered with Marquises,
who are only remembered by their servants.

707
01:34:54,149 --> 01:34:57,402
But you...

708
01:34:57,426 --> 01:35:01,196
You could remembered as the man
who brought John Wick,

709
01:35:01,221 --> 01:35:06,874
the most feared of all by the Table
and all who sit at it, into the light.

710
01:35:06,898 --> 01:35:09,444
Your light.

711
01:35:10,427 --> 01:35:16,933
And who could predict, how high that kind
of glory could take a man in our world?

712
01:35:33,476 --> 01:35:37,896
Noon, la Torre Eiffel,
to discuss rules.

713
01:35:37,921 --> 01:35:40,192
You may go.

714
01:35:40,217 --> 01:35:42,839
When I'm done.

715
01:35:42,864 --> 01:35:44,824
As his second, upon his victory,

716
01:35:44,849 --> 01:35:48,389
my excommunicado is to be lifted,
my title restored,

717
01:35:48,414 --> 01:35:51,415
my hotel rebuilt
and reconsecrated,

718
01:35:51,439 --> 01:35:53,966
all at the Table's expense.

719
01:35:55,616 --> 01:35:57,576
Of course.

720
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:00,060
I'm impressed.

721
01:36:07,110 --> 01:36:10,757
How you do anything is
how you do everything.

722
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:13,814
Now, I'm done.

723
01:36:17,065 --> 01:36:19,114
I think I'll miss you when you're gone.

724
01:36:19,139 --> 01:36:21,916
Shame I can't say the same.

725
01:36:21,941 --> 01:36:24,411
You don't know, do you?

726
01:36:24,436 --> 01:36:26,776
What's that?

727
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:28,271
A man's second,

728
01:36:28,296 --> 01:36:30,163
like his sponsor,

729
01:36:30,188 --> 01:36:32,149
either walks out
with his champion

730
01:36:32,174 --> 01:36:35,470
or is buried beside him.

731
01:36:35,495 --> 01:36:38,932
The old ways.

732
01:36:45,222 --> 01:36:47,677
Such is life.

733
01:37:33,682 --> 01:37:35,921
Under the old laws,

734
01:37:35,946 --> 01:37:38,263
only one can survive.

735
01:37:38,287 --> 01:37:41,634
You both understand that?

736
01:37:43,604 --> 01:37:45,117
Very good.

737
01:37:45,142 --> 01:37:46,957
Rules.

738
01:37:46,982 --> 01:37:48,998
The challenged chooses first.

739
01:37:49,022 --> 01:37:51,095
Time?

740
01:37:51,642 --> 01:37:53,662
Sunrise.

741
01:37:58,524 --> 01:38:00,437
Now.

742
01:38:03,594 --> 01:38:05,344
Sunrise.

743
01:38:05,369 --> 01:38:07,436
Location?

744
01:38:07,461 --> 01:38:08,543
You come here,

745
01:38:08,568 --> 01:38:12,716
thinking there is a way out
of this road for you, Mr. Wick?

746
01:38:13,799 --> 01:38:17,712
There is not.

747
01:38:18,055 --> 01:38:20,055
Le Centre Pompidou

748
01:38:22,565 --> 01:38:24,838
Sacré-Cœur.

749
01:38:28,748 --> 01:38:31,224
Sacré-Cœur.

750
01:38:31,248 --> 01:38:33,288
Weapons?

751
01:38:33,313 --> 01:38:34,968
If you win,

752
01:38:34,993 --> 01:38:37,085
the Table will honor its word.

753
01:38:38,042 --> 01:38:40,669
You will have your freedom.

754
01:38:40,693 --> 01:38:43,346
But you won't take it.

755
01:38:43,370 --> 01:38:44,513
Blades.

756
01:38:50,230 --> 01:38:51,890
Pistols.

757
01:38:56,603 --> 01:38:58,792
Dueling pistols.

758
01:38:58,816 --> 01:39:00,897
30 paces.

759
01:39:00,921 --> 01:39:03,541
In the event that both parties survive,

760
01:39:03,565 --> 01:39:06,878
Each will approach the other,
at increments of 10 paces,

761
01:39:06,902 --> 01:39:09,222
until only one remains.

762
01:39:10,619 --> 01:39:12,619
Rules of engagement.

763
01:39:13,156 --> 01:39:15,032
No quarter.

764
01:39:15,056 --> 01:39:18,096
You know why,
you won't take your freedom?

765
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:20,746
Hm?

766
01:39:20,771 --> 01:39:23,736
Cause this is who you are.

767
01:39:23,761 --> 01:39:27,541
Who you've always been.

768
01:39:27,565 --> 01:39:31,705
You are a killer.

769
01:39:31,729 --> 01:39:37,095
An orphan we plucked from
the street and hone into a knife.

770
01:39:37,119 --> 01:39:40,879
And it is the killing
that gives you purpose.

771
01:39:40,903 --> 01:39:44,400
A man without purpose...

772
01:39:44,425 --> 01:39:48,221
is nothing.

773
01:39:48,246 --> 01:39:50,313
No quarter.

774
01:39:51,237 --> 01:39:53,303
No quarter.

775
01:39:53,328 --> 01:39:55,996
If there is nothing else, gentlemen...

776
01:39:56,021 --> 01:39:57,662
- I will see...
- A nomination!

777
01:40:01,924 --> 01:40:03,358
That is his right.

778
01:40:05,202 --> 01:40:07,202
Do you have a name?

779
01:40:11,739 --> 01:40:13,166
Caine.

780
01:40:15,490 --> 01:40:17,283
So be it.

781
01:40:17,308 --> 01:40:20,949
Sunrise, Sacré-Cœur.

782
01:40:20,973 --> 01:40:23,446
Dueling pistols, no quarter.

783
01:40:23,470 --> 01:40:25,800
Should Mr. Wick be victorious,

784
01:40:25,825 --> 01:40:29,580
he'll be free of any and
all obligations to the High Table.

785
01:40:29,604 --> 01:40:31,887
And his second will be reinstated,

786
01:40:31,912 --> 01:40:35,647
as the manager of the
rebuilt New York Continental.

787
01:40:37,683 --> 01:40:41,523
Should the Marquis,
Vincent Bisset de Gramont, be victorious...

788
01:40:41,547 --> 01:40:45,427
John Wick will be dead...

789
01:40:45,452 --> 01:40:47,790
as will his second.

790
01:40:49,007 --> 01:40:50,774
Just so.

791
01:40:50,798 --> 01:40:54,558
Now, if there is nothing more, gentlemen.
I will see you at sunrise.

792
01:40:54,582 --> 01:40:57,157
Failure to meet at the
appointed hour will result in

793
01:40:57,181 --> 01:41:00,049
forfeiture and
immediate execution.

794
01:41:10,985 --> 01:41:15,313
There is no John, out there.

795
01:41:15,338 --> 01:41:18,438
No happy husband with a normal life.

796
01:41:20,809 --> 01:41:22,995
There's only John Wick,

797
01:41:23,020 --> 01:41:24,835
the killer.

798
01:41:26,603 --> 01:41:29,402
And he is going to kill you.

799
01:41:35,418 --> 01:41:37,491
Your hotel?

800
01:41:37,516 --> 01:41:38,740
Yes.

801
01:41:38,765 --> 01:41:41,074
You always have an angle, don't you?

802
01:41:41,098 --> 01:41:42,991
Doesn't everyone?

803
01:41:43,015 --> 01:41:46,794
Best find safe harbor before it starts.

804
01:41:46,819 --> 01:41:48,702
There's something I need to do first.

805
01:41:48,726 --> 01:41:51,715
Sooner, rather than later.

806
01:41:54,864 --> 01:41:56,524
Won't do it!

807
01:41:56,549 --> 01:41:58,577
You fight your own fight.

808
01:42:02,041 --> 01:42:05,432
Isn't this what you want?

809
01:42:05,457 --> 01:42:07,187
Hm?

810
01:42:07,211 --> 01:42:09,837
Victoria Faluja.

811
01:42:09,862 --> 01:42:13,475
You kill him, and you and
your daughter will be free.

812
01:42:15,306 --> 01:42:17,306
No one can touch here.

813
01:42:18,262 --> 01:42:20,303
If you don't...

814
01:42:20,328 --> 01:42:23,046
she will have to face the consequences.

815
01:42:24,570 --> 01:42:27,113
The choice is yours.

816
01:43:53,078 --> 01:43:55,078
Caine.

817
01:43:55,103 --> 01:43:56,841
John.

818
01:43:57,452 --> 01:43:59,452
Saying goodbyes?

819
01:44:00,709 --> 01:44:02,456
They're saying hello.

820
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:09,680
You think your wife can hear you?

821
01:44:11,944 --> 01:44:14,483
No.

822
01:44:16,646 --> 01:44:18,319
So why bother?

823
01:44:20,043 --> 01:44:21,769
Maybe I'm wrong.

824
01:44:25,372 --> 01:44:27,412
The dead are gone.

825
01:44:30,596 --> 01:44:33,089
Only the living matter.

826
01:44:37,913 --> 01:44:40,187
After my daughter was born...

827
01:44:42,098 --> 01:44:44,631
I want to leave this life.

828
01:44:46,288 --> 01:44:48,288
I thought I did.

829
01:44:50,044 --> 01:44:52,044
But you didn't.

830
01:44:53,746 --> 01:44:55,700
We're damned, John.

831
01:44:57,173 --> 01:44:59,904
You and I.

832
01:44:59,929 --> 01:45:02,509
On that, we agree.

833
01:45:06,126 --> 01:45:08,612
My daughter's not.

834
01:45:11,182 --> 01:45:13,536
It was between you and her.

835
01:45:15,100 --> 01:45:17,620
You're going to die.

836
01:45:23,649 --> 01:45:25,402
Maybe not.

837
01:45:30,426 --> 01:45:32,426
I missed you, John.

838
01:45:34,157 --> 01:45:37,310
It's so good to sit with a friend.

839
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:44,088
I'll see you tomorrow.

840
01:46:13,979 --> 01:46:16,879
This is how you resolve the situation?

841
01:46:16,904 --> 01:46:19,179
Duel with the Baba Yaga?

842
01:46:19,204 --> 01:46:22,559
Failure will shake the
foundation at the High Table.

843
01:46:23,543 --> 01:46:27,043
And it will turn Wick, into a saint.

844
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:33,180
My victory, will do the opposite.

845
01:46:34,380 --> 01:46:36,600
Marquis de Gramont!

846
01:46:37,684 --> 01:46:39,983
A man's ambition...

847
01:46:40,008 --> 01:46:42,783
should never exceed his worth.

848
01:46:45,191 --> 01:46:48,624
You would do well to remember that, sir.

849
01:48:08,848 --> 01:48:10,894
Bonjour, Monsieur Wick.

850
01:48:10,919 --> 01:48:13,985
And welcome, to La Resistance.

851
01:48:14,009 --> 01:48:16,049
Little far from home, aren't you?

852
01:48:16,073 --> 01:48:20,207
Well, your little act of uncivil
disobedience inspired me, John.

853
01:48:20,232 --> 01:48:23,982
I'm branching out,
spreading my wings.

854
01:48:24,006 --> 01:48:26,006
How goes the grand farewell tour?

855
01:48:27,683 --> 01:48:29,949
Coming to an end.

856
01:48:30,188 --> 01:48:32,516
So it seems, so it seems.

857
01:48:33,753 --> 01:48:35,660
42 Regular, was it?

858
01:48:36,670 --> 01:48:38,444
It's Kevlar, front to back.

859
01:48:38,468 --> 01:48:40,566
The latest in ballistic chic.

860
01:48:40,591 --> 01:48:42,338
Appropriate for all formal occasions.

861
01:48:42,362 --> 01:48:45,508
Wedding, funerals,
High Table duels.

862
01:48:45,532 --> 01:48:48,892
After all, a man has to look his
best when it's time to get married.

863
01:48:50,242 --> 01:48:51,456
Or buried.

864
01:49:02,059 --> 01:49:04,052
Forgive me, sir...

865
01:49:04,077 --> 01:49:06,666
but this is madness.

866
01:49:06,691 --> 01:49:08,384
Madness?

867
01:49:08,408 --> 01:49:10,617
Trusting your fate to a blind man?

868
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:14,400
There are three types of men in this world.

869
01:49:16,277 --> 01:49:19,432
Those who have something to live for.

870
01:49:19,457 --> 01:49:22,457
Those who have something to die for.

871
01:49:22,482 --> 01:49:25,275
And those who have something to kill for.

872
01:49:25,300 --> 01:49:28,106
John Wick has none of these things.

873
01:49:28,131 --> 01:49:31,211
He is, but a constant
search of a graveyard.

874
01:49:32,587 --> 01:49:35,181
But the blind man...

875
01:49:35,206 --> 01:49:37,079
Well, he has all three.

876
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:39,553
Besides...

877
01:49:39,577 --> 01:49:45,417
I have a feeling, Mr. Wick,
will never make it to the duel, by sunrise.

878
01:49:49,381 --> 01:49:51,381
I understand, sir.

879
01:50:29,758 --> 01:50:31,611
Alright now.

880
01:50:31,635 --> 01:50:34,528
For all you boppers out
there in the City of Lights.

881
01:50:34,552 --> 01:50:37,552
For all you street people
with an ear for the action.

882
01:50:38,302 --> 01:50:43,228
To all my loyal listeners,
who know the beat of the street.

883
01:50:43,648 --> 01:50:47,639
Tonight is your chance to
make some beautiful music.

884
01:50:48,289 --> 01:50:51,642
I've been asked to
relay a special request...

885
01:50:51,667 --> 01:50:54,473
from a secret admirer.

886
01:50:54,497 --> 01:50:59,310
It seems there's a thorn,
in our little slice of paradise.

887
01:50:59,799 --> 01:51:05,599
A wicked man from the Big Apple
is making a bee-line to our Sacred Heart.

888
01:51:06,676 --> 01:51:12,015
We're putting the call out to deliver
your hardest beat to this man in black.

889
01:51:12,047 --> 01:51:16,333
If you want the prize,
you must finish before sunrise.

890
01:51:16,357 --> 01:51:18,510
This golden oldie.

891
01:51:18,534 --> 01:51:21,647
And I do mean, golden... hit,

892
01:51:21,671 --> 01:51:24,331
goes out to you, Mr. Wick.

893
01:51:26,254 --> 01:51:27,594
And remember...

894
01:51:27,619 --> 01:51:29,320
there is nowhere to run.

895
01:52:34,837 --> 01:52:37,472
I want to thank you all for listening,

896
01:52:37,496 --> 01:52:40,559
to WUXIA.

897
01:52:40,583 --> 01:52:45,863
The place for all your entertainment,
and informational needs.

898
01:52:45,887 --> 01:52:48,813
Good hunting.

899
01:52:49,569 --> 01:52:51,650
And so it begins.

900
01:52:52,536 --> 01:52:54,736
I'm going to need a gun.

901
01:52:56,179 --> 01:52:58,093
I thought you'd never ask.

902
01:52:59,163 --> 01:53:01,577
9MM Pit Viper.

903
01:53:01,602 --> 01:53:03,537
How'd you get this?

904
01:53:03,561 --> 01:53:06,594
I know a guy, who knows a guy,
who shot a guy.

905
01:53:07,572 --> 01:53:12,592
21 round capacity magazine with a built-in
compensator for virtually no muzzle flip.

906
01:53:12,616 --> 01:53:14,242
Fiber-optic front sight.

907
01:53:14,266 --> 01:53:16,112
Ambidextrous safeties.

908
01:53:16,136 --> 01:53:18,576
Flared magwell for faster reloads.

909
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:20,600
2 pound extreme trigger.

910
01:53:20,624 --> 01:53:21,434
And...

911
01:53:21,459 --> 01:53:23,220
for those more,
who should we say,

912
01:53:23,245 --> 01:53:25,170
intimate encounters.

913
01:53:25,195 --> 01:53:28,142
This viper has ferocious fucking fangs.

914
01:53:33,212 --> 01:53:35,992
How close can you get me to the church?

915
01:53:41,035 --> 01:53:42,574
Amen.

916
01:53:52,402 --> 01:53:54,128
Here we are, gentlemen.

917
01:53:56,464 --> 01:53:57,724
Your ride.

918
01:54:01,094 --> 01:54:05,688
When I advised you not to dip
your pinkie back into this pond.

919
01:54:05,713 --> 01:54:08,649
I didn't think I'd get wet.

920
01:54:10,799 --> 01:54:12,926
It'll all be over, after today.

921
01:54:16,009 --> 01:54:18,009
When I was burying Charon...

922
01:54:20,166 --> 01:54:23,186
I was torn about what
to put on his gravestone.

923
01:54:24,689 --> 01:54:28,028
Few words to sum up an entire life?

924
01:54:28,053 --> 01:54:30,993
Long live the king!

925
01:54:31,017 --> 01:54:32,797
Had mine, many years ago.

926
01:54:34,287 --> 01:54:35,443
Modest?

927
01:54:36,374 --> 01:54:38,034
Prophetic.

928
01:54:38,410 --> 01:54:40,410
What did you decide?

929
01:54:41,047 --> 01:54:43,067
Friend.

930
01:54:43,091 --> 01:54:46,014
That's what he was,
above all else.

931
01:54:46,039 --> 01:54:48,514
A friend.

932
01:54:56,550 --> 01:54:58,909
Good night and
good luck, Mr. Wick.

933
01:55:00,781 --> 01:55:02,781
Thank you, King.

934
01:55:04,790 --> 01:55:07,004
Jonathan.

935
01:55:07,028 --> 01:55:08,648
Winston.

936
01:55:08,672 --> 01:55:11,166
Sunrise is at 6:03

937
01:55:11,433 --> 01:55:14,499
Don't be late,
for all our sakes.

938
01:55:23,490 --> 01:55:25,490
Loving husband.

939
01:55:25,514 --> 01:55:27,180
Hm?

940
01:55:27,204 --> 01:55:29,414
That's what I want on mine.

941
01:55:29,438 --> 01:55:30,667
John...

942
01:55:30,692 --> 01:55:33,632
Loving husband.

943
01:56:01,848 --> 01:56:03,008
Confirmed.

944
01:56:04,365 --> 01:56:06,572
Good news, Boppers.

945
01:56:06,596 --> 01:56:09,136
We have a sighting.

946
01:56:09,160 --> 01:56:13,527
Our man in black has
been spotted in Sector 7.

947
01:56:13,684 --> 01:56:17,271
I think it's high time we beat him red.

948
01:58:19,849 --> 01:58:23,862
It seems like our friends
at the Guild dropped the ball.

949
01:58:23,887 --> 01:58:26,974
And now it's rolling
to the Arc de Triomphe.

950
01:58:26,998 --> 01:58:28,701
Let's see who picks it up.

951
02:00:33,500 --> 02:00:35,360
Come on now, people.

952
02:00:35,384 --> 02:00:38,013
We're gonna have to do a lot better.

953
02:00:41,457 --> 02:00:44,402
Now, who's gonna be our big winner?

954
02:03:11,700 --> 02:03:12,773
Who is this?

955
02:03:12,798 --> 02:03:14,870
You know the question
you should be asking,

956
02:03:14,894 --> 02:03:15,428
huh,

957
02:03:15,453 --> 02:03:16,791
is how much?

958
02:03:16,815 --> 02:03:19,048
I think we have
the situation under control.

959
02:03:27,784 --> 02:03:29,204
Cause the way I see it...

960
02:03:29,228 --> 02:03:32,901
is that if Mr. Johnny Boy,
makes it to the church on time,

961
02:03:32,926 --> 02:03:35,481
this could be your last night as Marquis.

962
02:04:24,966 --> 02:04:27,547
The puppy dies now!

963
02:04:48,325 --> 02:04:50,444
A little traffic update.

964
02:04:50,468 --> 02:04:53,541
I'm hearing the boys
in black couldn't get it done.

965
02:04:54,045 --> 02:04:56,265
Our wicked friend is on the move again.

966
02:04:56,882 --> 02:04:58,562
He's heading your way.

967
02:04:58,587 --> 02:05:01,006
My listeners of the dead.

968
02:05:47,682 --> 02:05:49,829
- I'm pushing!
- Climb up! Climb!

969
02:07:04,378 --> 02:07:05,392
Yes?

970
02:07:05,416 --> 02:07:06,771
Fine!

971
02:07:06,795 --> 02:07:08,123
You have a deal.

972
02:07:08,148 --> 02:07:09,617
Alright, $35M it is.

973
02:07:10,737 --> 02:07:12,247
That wasn't our deal.

974
02:07:17,190 --> 02:07:19,424
Well, that's the only deal
being offered today.

975
02:07:42,961 --> 02:07:44,861
Kill!

976
02:07:52,790 --> 02:07:53,790
Phone!

977
02:07:58,380 --> 02:07:59,359
What?!

978
02:07:59,384 --> 02:08:01,366
- Now, listen to me.
- $40M!

979
02:08:03,049 --> 02:08:05,535
You pay for the service.

980
02:08:07,605 --> 02:08:08,971
Ok.

981
02:08:17,962 --> 02:08:19,963
Good news, Boppers.

982
02:08:22,317 --> 02:08:24,617
The lottery just went up.

983
02:08:48,641 --> 02:08:50,909
- No, fuck that!
- Let's go!

984
02:08:50,934 --> 02:08:52,656
We'll send him back.

985
02:13:24,057 --> 02:13:27,385
To all of you Boppers
still sitting on the side.

986
02:13:27,912 --> 02:13:31,185
Mr. Wick passed a church in sight.

987
02:13:32,809 --> 02:13:35,594
We are almost out of time.

988
02:13:35,619 --> 02:13:40,919
Last chance to win the prize
before Mr. Wick's last sunrise.

989
02:13:41,476 --> 02:13:45,936
So who out there is going
to climb those 222 steps?

990
02:13:52,900 --> 02:13:55,145
Good luck.

991
02:16:13,417 --> 02:16:14,417
Stop him, guys!

992
02:18:24,821 --> 02:18:27,957
It appears,
Mr. Wick won't be joining us.

993
02:18:46,733 --> 02:18:48,327
John?

994
02:18:50,678 --> 02:18:52,010
John?

995
02:18:53,613 --> 02:18:55,047
Caine.

996
02:18:55,072 --> 02:18:56,967
What time is sunrise?

997
02:18:59,984 --> 02:19:02,330
Two...

998
02:19:02,354 --> 02:19:04,567
Maybe, three minutes.

999
02:19:05,464 --> 02:19:08,947
I need you to get to
the top of those stairs, John.

1000
02:19:12,497 --> 02:19:13,839
Yeah.

1001
02:19:20,956 --> 02:19:22,834
Ready?

1002
02:19:22,858 --> 02:19:24,417
Yeah.

1003
02:19:43,034 --> 02:19:45,388
12 or 9?

1004
02:19:45,413 --> 02:19:46,413
9!

1005
02:20:20,061 --> 02:20:21,995
- Fix your 6.
- Thanks.

1006
02:21:37,021 --> 02:21:38,580
Goodbye, Mr. Wick.

1007
02:21:52,034 --> 02:21:53,534
You can't shoot me.

1008
02:21:58,131 --> 02:21:59,249
You're right.

1009
02:22:00,006 --> 02:22:01,062
But I can shoot him.

1010
02:22:02,205 --> 02:22:03,205
No!

1011
02:22:13,308 --> 02:22:15,248
I can't hit you.

1012
02:22:15,273 --> 02:22:16,273
Oh, fuck it.

1013
02:22:17,492 --> 02:22:18,804
Let's go, John.

1014
02:22:44,895 --> 02:22:46,306
Nuts.

1015
02:22:54,583 --> 02:22:57,041
You hit my puppy.

1016
02:23:13,178 --> 02:23:15,231
I feel, you owe me.

1017
02:23:15,256 --> 02:23:16,364
Yeah.

1018
02:23:25,168 --> 02:23:26,654
Nothing personal, John.

1019
02:23:27,637 --> 02:23:29,347
We're even, now.

1020
02:23:30,298 --> 02:23:32,091
Yeah.

1021
02:24:22,077 --> 02:24:23,844
And so we begin.

1022
02:24:44,369 --> 02:24:46,015
We seek the truth.

1023
02:24:46,040 --> 02:24:48,110
We will endure the consequences.

1024
02:24:48,134 --> 02:24:50,660
- Consequences.
- Consequences.

1025
02:25:10,190 --> 02:25:11,743
Go have a drink.

1026
02:25:50,521 --> 02:25:52,174
Positions, gentlemen.

1027
02:26:09,571 --> 02:26:11,571
30 paces.

1028
02:26:59,662 --> 02:27:01,962
- Remember your daughter.
- Fuck off!

1029
02:27:09,312 --> 02:27:11,955
What a beautiful sunrise.

1030
02:27:31,345 --> 02:27:33,511
Last words, Winston?

1031
02:27:34,849 --> 02:27:36,849
Just have fun out there.

1032
02:28:00,628 --> 02:28:02,581
Are you ready, Mr. Caine?

1033
02:28:09,065 --> 02:28:10,321
Mr. Wick?

1034
02:28:22,058 --> 02:28:24,991
I commend their souls to God.

1035
02:28:25,015 --> 02:28:27,268
We start as we end.

1036
02:28:27,292 --> 02:28:32,695
Dust we are,
and in dust we will become.

1037
02:28:35,041 --> 02:28:36,042
Fire!

1038
02:28:56,579 --> 02:28:58,259
20 paces.

1039
02:29:32,249 --> 02:29:33,311
Fire!

1040
02:29:44,963 --> 02:29:46,796
Nice.

1041
02:29:53,665 --> 02:29:55,367
10 paces.

1042
02:30:45,771 --> 02:30:47,937
Just kill him.

1043
02:31:07,161 --> 02:31:10,906
Those who cling to death...

1044
02:31:10,930 --> 02:31:13,223
live.

1045
02:31:14,866 --> 02:31:18,127
Those who cling to life...

1046
02:31:18,152 --> 02:31:20,243
die.

1047
02:31:29,520 --> 02:31:30,520
Fire!

1048
02:32:07,775 --> 02:32:09,107
Stop!

1049
02:32:10,037 --> 02:32:11,404
As your sponsor...

1050
02:32:13,428 --> 02:32:15,054
I claim the Coup de Grâce.

1051
02:32:19,111 --> 02:32:21,111
Your weapon, give it to me.

1052
02:32:21,927 --> 02:32:23,677
Is my daughter free now?

1053
02:32:24,954 --> 02:32:25,929
Oui.

1054
02:32:25,953 --> 02:32:27,961
You and your daughter.

1055
02:32:27,986 --> 02:32:29,205
Enjoy.

1056
02:32:47,037 --> 02:32:49,037
- Rules...
- Huh.

1057
02:32:50,434 --> 02:32:53,027
You arrogant asshole.

1058
02:32:53,804 --> 02:32:55,770
He didn't shoot.

1059
02:32:56,359 --> 02:32:57,904
Consequences!

1060
02:33:14,148 --> 02:33:16,148
That's fucking cool, man.

1061
02:33:36,082 --> 02:33:39,268
Your obligation to the Table...

1062
02:33:40,686 --> 02:33:42,979
is satisfied, John Wick.

1063
02:33:43,004 --> 02:33:44,806
You are free.

1064
02:33:49,216 --> 02:33:51,909
As are you and your daughter, sir.

1065
02:33:54,423 --> 02:33:57,803
You will be fully reinstated, Mr. Manager.

1066
02:33:58,716 --> 02:34:01,342
All of your terms...

1067
02:34:01,366 --> 02:34:04,792
will be fulfilled.

1068
02:34:09,016 --> 02:34:12,172
Our business here now, is concluded.

1069
02:34:12,197 --> 02:34:13,585
Good day.

1070
02:34:54,790 --> 02:34:56,790
My brother.

1071
02:34:59,140 --> 02:35:01,140
You owe me one.

1072
02:35:03,430 --> 02:35:05,430
Yeah.

1073
02:35:27,087 --> 02:35:29,177
Winston?

1074
02:35:29,201 --> 02:35:31,201
Jonathan?

1075
02:35:33,157 --> 02:35:35,945
Will you take me home?

1076
02:35:41,943 --> 02:35:43,703
Of course.

1077
02:38:19,568 --> 02:38:22,068
Never thought I'd see the day.

1078
02:38:27,292 --> 02:38:31,153
Where do you think he is?
Heaven or hell?

1079
02:38:35,956 --> 02:38:37,748
Who knows?

1080
02:38:54,155 --> 02:38:58,315
Goodbye, my son.
