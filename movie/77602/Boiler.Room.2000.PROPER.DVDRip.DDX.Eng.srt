1
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,520
I read this article
a while back...

2
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,400
that said Microsoft employs more
millionaire secretaries...

3
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,760
than any other company
in the world.

4
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,040
They took stock options
over Christmas bonuses.

5
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,200
It was a good move.

6
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,640
I remember there was this photograph
of one of the groundskeepers...

7
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,840
next to his Ferrari.

8
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,840
Blew my mind.

9
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,800
You see shit like that,
and it just plants seeds...

10
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,320
makes you think it's possible,
even easy.

11
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,360
And then you turn on the TV,
and there's just more of it.

12
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,880
The $87 million dollar
lottery winner.

13
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,920
That kid actor that just made
20 million on his last movie.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,440
That Internet stock that
shot through the roof.

15
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,520
You could've made millions on it
if you'd just got in early.

16
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,520
And that's exactly
what I wanted to do..get in.

17
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,800
I didn't want to be an innovator. I just
wanted to make the quick, easy buck.

18
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,080
I just wanted in.

19
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,440
Notorious B.I.G.
said it best..

20
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,760
"Either you're slinging crack rock,
or you got a wicked jump shot".

21
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,120
Nobody wants to work
for it anymore.

22
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,640
There's no honorin taking
that after-school job at Mickey D's.

23
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,480
Honor's in the dollar, kid.

24
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,480
So I went the white-boy way
of slinging crack rock.

25
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,120
I became a stockbroker.

26
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,000
- Get off!
- Two hundred!

27
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,800
Put your money back down!
Yo! Put your money back down!

28
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,320
So I got in at this firm,
J. T. Marlin...

29
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,200
owned by
this guy Michael Brantley...

30
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,520
a salesman among salesmen.

31
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,400
Mr. Brantley!

32
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,080
- Mr. Brantley! Welcome! How are you?
- How you gonna handle these guys?

33
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,520
- They're great.
- You think you can handle this or what?

34
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,400
- I think so. We can handle it.
- You can handle it?

35
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,360
A double scotch on the rocks.

36
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,120
Holy shit, yo.
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!

37
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,320
That's the jockey from Venezuela.
He's a sicko. He weighs like 48 pounds.

38
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,080
119, but you're close, slut.

39
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,200
Whatever. Give me three-to-one
on that skinny little nigger.

40
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,360
Richie, Richie.
Do me a favor, will you?

41
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,720
Just for, like, ten minutes.
Just give it a rest.

42
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,960
Yo, homes, I need some "chocaine".
I need some motherfuckin' nose candy.

43
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,040
I need some cizzi up my nizzi...

44
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,960
'cause I need to get high
like a motherfucker.

45
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,000
Know what I'm sayin'?
So give me some of that nose candy.

46
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,320
Bring that table over here.

47
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,440
Everybody quiet down for a second.
All right. Hold on.

48
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:53,520
Thanks. I wanted to let you know those
pikers at the N.A.S.D. are off our ass.

49
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,360
- Fuckin' retard.
- Fuck you. I'm on vacation.

50
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,880
Bear Stearns can call the S.E.C.
They can't find any dirt on us.

51
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,240
J.T. Marlin, once again,
has unlimited trading authorization.

52
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,960
I told you guys.
You can't keep a good man down!

53
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,040
We're superstars now.

54
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,000
J.P. Morgan just faxed over
their congratulations...

55
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,960
and said,
"Welcome to the club".

56
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,640
This also means those teams
headed by Todd and Richie...

57
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,000
who were good enough
to give up their rep numbers...

58
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,680
They can stop cold calling
and start trading again.

59
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,720
Welcome back!

60
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,720
And just to show you
how appreciative I am...

61
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,000
there's a little something extra.

62
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,640
Tell me about it, baby, tell me!

63
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,320
I want you guys
to go up to suite 418.

64
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,200
I handpicked them myself.

65
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,920
We're players now, boys!
Let's celebrate. Salute!

66
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,240
Don't touch the cards.
Don't touch the cards.

67
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,560
- Fourteen.
- Hit me.

68
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,040
Come on, Mike. I told you you
gotta hit the table. Sixteen.

69
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,360
Hit me.

70
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,960
And bust.
Sorry about that.

71
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,880
Fuck! Can't
win a fuckin' hand tonight!

72
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,600
Hey, Steve?
Come here for a second.

73
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,400
You thirsty?
I don't care.

74
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,120
Go take my car and get Mike a Coke
and a falafel. You hungry?

75
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,280
Yeah. Yeah.
Sure. Why not?

76
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,240
- And dealer busts.
- Yeah!

77
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,200
What the fuck are
you so happy about?

78
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,360
Whoa, take it easy.

79
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,520
Roller coaster.
Ups and downs. You know that.

80
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,480
All right. Place your bets.

81
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,040
I was living in Kew Gardens Hills,
running my biz...

82
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,200
giving the Queens College kids
something to do between classes.

83
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,720
- See you guys.
- Fuck you.

84
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,000
- Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
- I was doing well.

85
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,120
It's strange to think how
that knock changed everything.

86
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,560
Everything.
Hey, don't get me wrong here.

87
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,120
No, no. I got it.

88
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,600
I don't believe in fate.
I believe in odds.

89
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,680
- He's not gonna let you in.
- Why not?

90
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,600
'Cause he doesn't know who you are.
He'll think you're a cop.

91
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,240
So what? I got a bankroll
that'll choke a hippo. Let's just see.

92
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,800
- Who are you?
- What's up?

93
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,320
- It's my boy, Greg. Oh, shit!
- What are you doin'? Come in.

94
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,920
What's goin' on? Come here, crazy.
What are you doin'?

95
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,680
How're you doin'?
Come in. Come in.

96
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,920
Oh, shit. Wait.
Is that your new ride?

97
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,640
- Him.
- Nice.

98
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,640
- Hi. Seth.
- Hey. Greg.

99
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,960
Nice to meet you.

100
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,080
- We thought we were done for the night.
- Too late to get a couple hands in?

101
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,080
No, no, no. 24-7.

102
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,520
Hey, Steve, could you get us
a couple of sandwiches?

103
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,080
- All right. Give me 400.
- Wait. What about the betting?

104
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,160
- What were you thinking?
- Five hundred, max?

105
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,240
We don't usually
service that level of action...

106
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,360
but I hate
to turn away a new customer.

107
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,440
We might not have enough cash
to settle you at the end of the night.

108
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,360
That's okay.
You can just pay me tomorrow.

109
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,800
All right.
How much you want?

110
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,360
- Five dimes.
- Jeff.

111
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,680
You had to do it, didn't you?

112
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,320
You make me look
like I'm at the kiddie table.

113
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,360
- If the shoe fits, kid. Come on.
- Fuckin' rich man.

114
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,680
- What denomination?
- What denomination?

115
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,320
How about three Puerto Ricans,
two Chinks and a Guinea?

116
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,360
I don't care. Mix it up.
Whatever you want.

117
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,480
What about a Swahili? Jesus.

118
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,120
I don't know what that is either.
You're starting to upset me.

119
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,200
You got your own chips, huh,
with your name on them?

120
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,120
This is no joke.

121
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,560
We used to use the
Bicycle poker chips...

122
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,480
and then some kid started
sneaking in additional funds.

123
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,560
- Who's that? Moyshe?
- No, no. Some kid up the block.

124
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,400
Fuckin' Moyshe.

125
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,680
- So that's a nice car you have there.
- Thanks. A Ferrari.

126
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,840
Yeah. It's a 355,
six-speed transmission, right?

127
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,480
Yeah. It's a synchromesh.
I love it. Nice.

128
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,520
Yo, shit is yellow, B.
Rizzy's the color, nugga.

129
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,800
Yellow's filthy. Come on.

130
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,240
It's Big Bird mode.

131
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,120
All right.
Place your bets.

132
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,000
- Hey.
- You are late.

133
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,840
- I know. I'm sorry.
- Your father is really upset.

134
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,080
- He won't even tell me what it is.
- Jesus.

135
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,480
- Hey.
- What's up, Seth?

136
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,960
- How you doin'? How's school?
- It's all right.

137
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,440
That's a good question, Seth.
You wanna tell us what happened?

138
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:15,120
- We didn't know if you were comin'.
- Oh, yeah. Traffic was crazy.

139
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,840
So?

140
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,760
Do you wanna wait till after
dinner to talk about it?

141
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,040
Yeah, let's eat first.

142
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,040
- Answer the question, Seth.
- I dropped out.

143
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,240
You wanna tell us why?

144
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,080
Well, I gave it a year, Dad,
and it's just not for me.

145
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,200
I see. So that means you've been
lying to us for six months.

146
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,480
Six months, Seth.

147
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,960
"School's fine, Dad.
My grades are good, Dad".

148
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,840
Let's just leave that for a second.
So you dropped out.

149
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,000
That means you haven't been getting
your student loan checks, right?

150
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,520
Is that right? How are you making
the rent every month, Seth?

151
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,960
I'm running a business,
and I'm just earning a living.

152
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,600
Earning a living? This what
you call earning a living?

153
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,600
- Marty, are those drugs?
- Yes.

154
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,520
- Yes, those are drugs?
- No, Mom. This is an honest living.

155
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,240
And you can ask any one
of my customers.

156
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,600
What do you mean, "customers"?
Where's the customers?

157
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,480
They're children of people
in this community.

158
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,160
How do you think I got these?
Anyway, it's illegal.

159
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,040
You're running a backdoor card game!
How do you think this reflects on me?

160
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,800
I'm a judge,
for Christ's sake!

161
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,800
Are you listening to me?

162
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,720
I'm gonna be honest with you.
You're runnin 'a good business.

163
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,600
I think you're a smart kid,
pullin' in some real cash.

164
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,080
But I gotta tell you, man,
this is risky fuckin' business.

165
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,360
I mean, you really honestly plan
on dealing cards to college kids...

166
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,440
when you're fuckin' 35?

167
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,560
You don't think you'll get pinched
in the next couple years?

168
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:57,200
Maybe it's time to start thinkin'
about down-the-line time.

169
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,680
So, you want me
to come work for you?

170
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,760
What? I guess it'll be like retribution
for me taking all your money here?

171
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,720
First of all, I am not
done with you here, all right?

172
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,760
And, no, you're only gonna
work for me a short time.

173
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,680
You pass the Series Seven.

174
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,040
You learn the ropes.
You're on your own.

175
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,240
Yeah, ask Adam, man.
He'll tell you.

176
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,400
- It's good.
- It's good?

177
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,440
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna be blunt.

178
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,000
We're talkin' about
millions of dollars.

179
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,000
I was making
goodmoney with the casino...

180
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,280
but these guys
were macking it hard.

181
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,880
That's the level
I wanted to be operating on.

182
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,400
So I drove out
to Long Island, way out.

183
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,360
The office was a good hour
away from Wall Street.

184
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,240
Somebody forgot to tell the guys
who worked there, though.

185
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,960
They looked and acted...

186
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,840
like they took the Six train
to Fulton Street everymorning.

187
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,320
But it wasn't Wall Street.

188
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,920
It was exit 53
on the Long Island Expressway...

189
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,280
a good hour from
the New York Stock Exchange.

190
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,800
No, no, no, no. You don't wanna act now.
This stock is going to turn.

191
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,320
I'm invested very heavily myself.
We just stay put.

192
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,640
I don't know if you've ever had the
opportunity to purchase I.P.O. before...

193
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,800
but we have this company that's going
to market in about a week or so.

194
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,480
We're gonna have to move on this now.
This is gonna happen next week.

195
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,760
We don't wanna marry this stock.
We're in; we're out.

196
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,600
What do you mean, you don't buy stock
over the phone? How do you do it?

197
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,640
Smoke signals? Telepathy? World leaders
solve problems over the phone.

198
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,480
I'm not a Charles Schwab.
I don't need your business; I value it.

199
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,840
I'm successful to the point where
I don't need to chase your business.

200
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,480
Hey, kid, get the fuck
outta here!

201
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,880
Over here.

202
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,560
- Have they started interviewing yet?
- No.

203
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:43,040
- Know how long it's gonna be?
- You'll all be going in together.

204
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,520
But I thought
this was, like, an interview?

205
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,000
It is. It's a group interview.
You'll see.

206
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,360
No, man.
You're a male.

207
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,400
Group interview, my ass.

208
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,000
It was like a Hitler Youth rally,
in retrospect.

209
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,560
The guy who pitched us, Jim Young,
was the head recruiter there.

210
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,840
- Okay, guys. Let's go.
- Between him and Michael, honestly...

211
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,640
they could sell bubble gum
in the lockjaw ward at Bellevue.

212
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,520
I'm sorry, man.
This is my seat.

213
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,560
- Oh, shit. I'm so sorry.
- It's okay. Don't worry about it.

214
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,800
- Fuckin' dumb-ass.
- Get the fuck outta here.

215
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,240
- What?
- Don't talk to me. Don't look at me.

216
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,080
Just get your ass out of that Italian
leather chair and get the fuck out.

217
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,680
Right now. Come on.
Let's go, schlepp rock.

218
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,440
Out.

219
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,040
Sit down.

220
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,960
We expect everyone here to
treat their coworkers...

221
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,000
with a certain level
of respect.

222
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:09,960
Before we start, I have one question.
Has anyone passed a Series Seven exam?

223
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,480
- I have a Series Seven license.
- Good for you. You can get out too.

224
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,560
What? Why?

225
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,360
We don't hire brokers here.
We train new ones.

226
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,440
That's it, Skippy.
Pack your shit. Let's go.

227
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,800
Okay. Here's the deal.

228
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,480
I'm not here to waste your time.
I hope you're not here to waste mine.

229
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,360
So I'm gonna keep this short.

230
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,320
If you become an employee
of this firm...

231
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,920
you will make your first million
within three years.

232
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,480
Okay? I repeat that:

233
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,240
You will make a million dollars
within three years...

234
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,240
of your first day of employment
at J.T. Marlin.

235
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,360
There is no question whether or not
you'll become a millionaire here.

236
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,240
The only question
is how many times over.

237
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,680
You think I'm joking?
I am not joking.

238
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,440
I am a millionaire.
It's a weird thing to hear, right?

239
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,080
I'll tell ya.
It's a weird thing to say.

240
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,280
I am a fucking millionaire.

241
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,280
And guess how old I am.
Twenty-seven.

242
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,080
You know what that makes me here?
A fuckin' senior citizen.

243
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,600
This firm is entirely comprised
of people your age, not mine.

244
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,440
Lucky for me, I'm very fucking good
at my job, or I'd be out of one.

245
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,360
You guys are the new blood.
You're gonna go home with the kessef.

246
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,760
You are the future big swinging dicks
of this firm.

247
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:30,640
Now, you all look money hungry,
and that's good.

248
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,440
Anybody tells you money is the root
of all evil doesn't fuckin' have any.

249
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,960
They say money can't buy happiness?
Look at the fuckin' smile on my face.

250
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,480
Ear to ear, baby.
You want details? Fine.

251
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,040
I drive a Ferrari
355 Cabriolet.

252
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:49,000
What's up? I have a ridiculous house
in the South Fork.

253
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,480
I have every toy you could imagine,
and best of all, kids...

254
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,440
I am liquid.

255
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,720
So, now you know what's possible.
Let me tell you what's required.

256
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,080
You are required to work
your fucking ass off at this firm.

257
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,720
We want winners here, not pikers.
A piker walks at the bell.

258
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,000
A piker asks how much vacation you get
in the first year. Vacation?

259
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,280
People come and work at this firm
for one reason: to become filthy rich.

260
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,600
We're not here to make friends.
We're not savin' the manatees, guys.

261
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,800
You want vacation time?
Go teach third grade, public school.

262
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,360
Okay. The first three months
at the firm are as a trainee.

263
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,560
You make $1 50 a week.

264
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,680
After you're done training,
you take the Series Seven.

265
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,160
Pass that, you become junior broker...

266
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,840
and you open accounts
for your team leader.

267
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,440
You open 40 accounts, you start
workin' for yourself. Sky's the limit.

268
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,880
Word about being a trainee.

269
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,080
Friends, parents, other brokers,
they're gonna give you shit.

270
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,240
It's true. $150 a week?
Not a lot of money.

271
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,160
Pay them no mind.

272
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,440
You need to learn this business,
and this is the time to do it.

273
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,280
Once you pass the test,
none of that's gonna matter.

274
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,320
Your friends are shit.

275
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,920
Tell them you made 25 grand last month,
they're won't fucking believe you.

276
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,240
Fuck them! Fuck 'em!

277
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,840
Parents don't like the life you lead?
" Fuck you, Mom and Dad".

278
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:13,160
See how it feels when you're makin'
their fuckin' Lexus payments.

279
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,640
Now, go home and think about it.
Think about whether it's really for you.

280
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,080
If you decide it isn't...
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

281
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,040
It's not for everyone.
Thanks.

282
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,160
But if you
really want this...

283
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,560
you call me on Monday
and we'll talk.

284
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,120
Just don't
waste my fuckin' time.

285
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,240
Okay. That's it.

286
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,880
- Hi.
- Hi.

287
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,920
So, what's up?

288
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,440
- How you doin'?
- I'm fine, Seth. What's on your mind?

289
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:35,680
I feel bad about the way things went
at the house last week.

290
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,480
I just don't feel like we get
anywhere when we talk at home.

291
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:44,200
Well, I don't know
that there's anything to talk about.

292
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,040
- Can I get you anything to drink?
- No. I'm fine, thanks.

293
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,760
You dropped out
of school, Seth.

294
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,880
You're running an illegal casino
out of your apartment.

295
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,560
You're putting my career at risk.
What is there to talk about, Seth?

296
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,280
Well, I don't know why
we can't just discuss this. I mean...

297
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,280
Maybe you're just not
seeing my side.

298
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,600
Your side? What side?
You're doing wrong.

299
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,800
I'm not your best friend.
That's your mother's racket.

300
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,240
I'm your father.
I tell you when you screw up.

301
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,080
What did you think I was gonna do?
Pat you on the back for the casino idea?

302
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,560
Tell you what
a great entrepreneur you are?

303
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,960
So what do you want me
to do, Seth?

304
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,600
I mean, my God, if I'd called my father
to meet me for a cup of coffee...

305
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,560
to talk about my screwups,
he probably would've laughed.

306
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,240
We didn't have nice little chats
about why I was a bad boy.

307
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,080
I got smacked.

308
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,800
And I didn't do it again.
Much simpler.

309
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,120
Look. I'm just trying to restore
what's left of our relationship.

310
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,200
"Relationship"?

311
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,400
What the fuck are you
talking about, relationship?

312
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,800
What? Are we dating?

313
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,920
I'm not your girlfriend Seth;
I'm your father.

314
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,160
Clean up your life,
make an honest living...

315
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,800
and then you and I can talk
like normal people, all right?

316
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,080
- Hey, Seth.
- Hi. How you doin'?

317
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:27,280
- Abby.
- Oh, yeah. I know. I forgot.

318
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,520
It's okay. I never told you.

319
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,880
Besides, the other day
you looked a little frazzled...

320
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,000
so I didn't think
you'd remember anyway.

321
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,040
- Today's my first day.
- No shit?

322
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,720
Yeah.

323
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,080
- See ya.
- See ya.

324
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,880
No, that's not how it works.

325
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,040
If I was asking you to
own 5,000 or 10,000 shares...

326
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,080
of some pink-sheet, bullshit company
with negative earnings...

327
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,880
I'd tell you
to hang up the phone...

328
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,640
call your local broker
and short the stock.

329
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,360
I wouldn't expect your business.
But, Don, I am bringing you...

330
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,840
Seth. Seth. Come over here.
It's not your table.

331
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,160
...F.D.A. Iandmark approval.
It's, like, the cancer pill.

332
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,280
No. It's a cancer pill.
No, Don, it's not Propecia P.

333
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,880
It is the cancer pill.
Oh, Donald, please take a chance.

334
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,000
You look pretty.

335
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,360
Thank you.

336
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,440
So you wanna tell me where the fuck
you were last night?

337
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,680
- Not particularly.
- Okay.

338
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,400
This is for you.

339
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:47,720
I don't know how to better
explain this to you, but...

340
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,440
it's over.

341
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,320
Okay. I disagree.

342
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,560
- Hang on a second.
- Here you go.

343
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,280
- What's up? Is he in?
- I don't know.

344
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,440
Hey. These are the D&B cards.
These are our leads.

345
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,640
- Morning.
- Every card is an opportunity, right?

346
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,000
These are good leads.
People on these cards buy stock.

347
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,240
Your job is to call them
and get them interested in the firm.

348
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,960
You're not actually selling stock yet,
but you're selling the dream.

349
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,880
So get 'em wet. Tell 'em
that in a month from now...

350
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,360
a senior broker's gonna
call them back with an idea.

351
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,880
So who are these people?

352
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,200
Average client's 45 years old,
from the Midwest...

353
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,880
$1 50,000 annual income,
1 million net, has a local broker...

354
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,960
but loves a hotshot New Yorker
who sounds good on the phone.

355
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,360
So the card won't tell you that. It only
has name, address and occupation.

356
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,800
So you gotta
feel 'em out, see?

357
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,120
"Peter Davis, Vice President,
Parks Telecommunications".

358
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,040
The guy's probably
a fuckin' whale.

359
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,640
So feel 'im out, see what he's got.
Truth is, it doesn't matter these days.

360
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,640
With the Dow where it is now,
everybody wants a piece of the market.

361
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,200
I can close anyone anytime anywhere.
Just give me a phone number.

362
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,920
- Greg, I have John Duncklee on three.
- Not now. I'll call him back.

363
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,640
Now, once you qualify the guy,
you send him a press packet.

364
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,000
It'll be easy, and it'll get you
comfortable on the phone, which is key.

365
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,160
This entire business revolves
around the phone. Play the numbers.

366
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,520
This is a contact sport. The more people
you contact, the better you'll do.

367
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,080
- A good broker makes 700 calls a day.
- What's the phone bill like?

368
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,520
This month
was approaching 400,000.

369
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,320
Listen to me. Even though
you're not selling stock yet...

370
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,640
I want you to remember the code
we have here, okay?

371
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,560
- Did you see Glengarry Glen Ross ?
- Yeah.

372
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,640
- Do you remember "ABC"?
- Yeah. "Always be closing".

373
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,240
That's right. "Always be closing".
"Telling's not selling".

374
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,560
That's the attitude you wanna have.
There's two rules as a trainee.

375
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,480
Number one:
We don't pitch the bitch here.

376
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,840
What?

377
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,160
We don't sell stock to women.
I don't care who it is; we don't do it.

378
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,000
Nancy Sinatra calls,
you tell her you're sorry.

379
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,600
They're a constant pain
in the ass...

380
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,560
and you're never
gonna hear the end of it.

381
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,120
They'll call you every fucking day
wanting to know why the stock dropped.

382
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,840
And God forbid
the stock should go up.

383
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,880
You're gonna hear
from them every 1 5 minutes.

384
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,960
It's just not worth it.
Don't pitch the bitch.

385
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,120
Number two:
Don't write wood, all right?

386
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,800
A lot of trainees are so anxious
to get off the phone...

387
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,160
that they just steamroll the guy
into getting the press packet...

388
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,480
so they can hang up.

389
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,840
Then I call back, and I'm, like...

390
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,960
" Hi. You spoke to a junior
associate of mine last month".

391
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,840
And he's like, " Not interested. Bye".
That's a shitty lead, okay?

392
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,080
That's fucking wood.
The info we send is bullshit, all right?

393
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,880
The most important part is telling them
you have that one great idea...

394
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,160
and that a senior broker's
gonna call them back in a month.

395
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,200
This way they don't think
we just fire off a million recos a day.

396
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,680
We don't want clients thinkin'...

397
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,640
you're pitching something
you read in the Journal, right?

398
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,640
- Yeah. Right.
- Okay, so no wood.

399
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,880
- I'm serious. No wood.
- All right. Take it easy.

400
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:44,640
Hey, don't even start
that fuckin' shit with me, okay?

401
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,440
I'm tryin' to tell you what's expected
of you and what your job is.

402
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,480
I'm tryin' to make the job easier, okay?
Don't give me any fuckin' lip.

403
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:55,080
Okay. Okay, so, fine.

404
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,800
What happens if the guy
wants to buy stock right then?

405
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,120
Now you're talkin'. You wanna go
into every call expecting just that.

406
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,400
If somebody wants a recommendation,
put the guy on hold...

407
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,160
stand up and yell "reco"
at the top of your lungs.

408
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,160
First senior broker who gets
on the horn gets the sale.

409
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,360
- Sound good?
- Yeah.

410
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:17,280
Okay. That suit's dog shit.
Get a new suit.

411
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,040
No, Ma. I told you.
No, I'm not a broker yet.

412
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,160
I'm a trainee. I still have
to pass my Series Seven test.

413
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,680
Please.
You're a stockbroker.

414
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,200
You wear a suit to work
every day, don't you?

415
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,400
- Yeah.
- So, what are we arguing about?

416
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,080
- Thanks, Ma.
- You're doing great, Seth.

417
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,080
You're working your way up
from the bottom. Never easy.

418
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,880
What did Dad say about it?

419
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,400
He's very happy.
Shocked, but very happy.

420
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,880
- He's waiting for you to call him.
- Why doesn't he call me?

421
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,800
- One miracle at a time, okay, sweetie?
- All right.

422
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,200
- Mom?
- I'm in bed.

423
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,080
- How you doin'?
- Hi, baby. How was work?

424
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,760
I know you're not at home with a bag
of cash, waiting for me to call you.

425
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,360
But I'm not some 18-year old selling
the cure for Al DS. I am 46 years old.

426
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,120
I have 22 years of market experience.
I know this business.

427
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,040
So pick up your skirt, grab your balls
and let's make some money.

428
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,640
Here you go, Greg.

429
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,080
I hope this is better
than the last batch of shit you gave me.

430
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,440
- Produced more wood than Ron Jeremy.
- What?

431
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,680
I don't want you to yell "reco" anymore.
Know what you should yell? "Timber!"

432
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,240
Yeah. Mr. Fuckin' Wood.
I hear you fuckin' makin' your calls.

433
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,200
It's bullshit, all right?

434
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,920
If you want them off the phone so bad,
why don't you just hang up?

435
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
You should get them excited.
You know, excited?

436
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,000
They should beg for a broker
on the first call. Shit.

437
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,600
Yeah. Howard Young, please.
Seth Davis over atJ.T. Marlin.

438
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,040
- No, he's not expecting my call.
- No. Tsk.

439
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,200
- Okay. Yeah. I'll call you.
- Good-bye. Good-bye.

440
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,600
Hang up the phone.

441
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,120
Thank you. That's nice
for you to do that for me.

442
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,240
First of all, there's gonna be a lot of
these regardless of how good you are...

443
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,920
but you happen to suck big,
fat-ass rhinoceros dick.

444
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,160
Well, thank you.
That's confidence-inspiring.

445
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,240
I got this friend who runs this
other firm, right?

446
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,960
He hands out
this book to new trainees.

447
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,840
It's called a rebuttal book.
It looks like a little Filofax.

448
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,560
It's got these index tabs,
but instead of having letters...

449
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,160
like "A" to "B", "G" to " H",
it has different things like...

450
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,200
"My wife won't let me"...

451
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,880
or "I'm not in the market now"
or "Send me a prospectus".

452
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,800
It has a rebuttal
for any excuse.

453
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,800
Anyway, that's stuff
you'll have to learn later.

454
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,480
The most important thing
you gotta know right now...

455
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,880
is that you can be whoever
you wanna be on the phone.

456
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,640
You know what I'm sayin'? Who cares?
Do what you gotta do.

457
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,800
Change your last name.
Say you're the fuckin' vice president.

458
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,920
You know? Who cares?
Just get the cocksucker on the line.

459
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,760
Yeah, but how can I do shit like that?
Isn't there a compliance officer here?

460
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,400
No. No, man. Everybody does that shit.
Are you kidding?

461
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,040
I mean, even on Wall Street.

462
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,400
You talking about John there?
That guy works for us.

463
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,240
The guy's a fuckin' chimp. Look at him.
The only compliance work...

464
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,480
he's doin' is makin' sure my lunch
is still hot when it gets here.

465
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:06,880
He's only here because the S.E.C.
requires it. Easiest job in the world.

466
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,160
Look. I think he's actually
masturbating right now.

467
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:21,400
- Stay the fuck away from her.
- Yeah.

468
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,840
Holy shit, you slut.
You made the call.

469
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,520
No, no. Don't you dare. Get your
filthy one-race paws off my money.

470
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,320
What'd you bet me?
A month's commission?

471
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,920
- Yeah, and yours too, kid.
- How do you get away with this?

472
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,040
'Cause I'm a Jew,
and I have the mind of a champion.

473
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,400
See this?

474
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,760
Here, kid.
Go get a tan and some Rogaine.

475
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,640
- Watch out for this.
- Fuckin' A.

476
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,000
The only bookie in New York
that delivers FedEx.

477
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,440
When are you gonna
take the test, Seth?

478
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,680
Well, you know, after
the training program's over.

479
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,200
They want you to get a good idea
of how things work there...

480
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,240
before you take the Series Seven,
but it's a great system.

481
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,600
- I'm really learning a lot.
- Are you gonna be rich, Seth?

482
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,880
- Oh, God willing.
- I hope so.

483
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,800
How come I've
never heard of this firm?

484
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,480
I don't know.

485
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,240
It's a smaller firm, I guess.

486
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,880
There's a million others like it
you probably never heard of.

487
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,080
The reason I ask is 'cause I would've
thought that you would've...

488
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:26,080
joined a firm like Goldman Sachs
or something of that stature.

489
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,040
- Marty, what are you starting for?
- What?

490
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,560
No, no. Ma, it's okay.
The reason is, Dad...

491
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,000
that the larger houses don't really like
to hire kids straight out of college...

492
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,960
you know, unless you went
to an Ivy League school...

493
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,840
or you wanna do cash-flow analysis
for the next 15 years.

494
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,840
They usually like you
to work...

495
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,840
outside their firm for a few years
to get a good sense of the marketplace.

496
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:56,320
But most all brokers usually start out
in little firms like J.T. Marlin.

497
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,920
That's great. See? He answered
the question. That was easy.

498
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:08,560
So all you have to do
is close the casino, right?

499
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,600
Marty,
we talked about this.

500
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,320
- What are you giving me looks for?
- Didn't we talk about this?

501
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,280
- What? I just...
- It was a celebration.

502
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:26,440
You know what?
I gotta go meet somebody.

503
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,160
I love you, Ma.

504
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,640
See ya.
See ya later.

505
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,120
Nice job, Marty.

506
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:45,000
Originally, I got in for the cash.
But getting my dad's respect...

507
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,920
That's what kept me there.

508
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,160
So he took some parting shots from time
to time. Whatever. I didn 't care.

509
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,400
Not really.

510
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,160
Anyway, the point is,
I had to adapt to this new world.

511
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,840
I didn 't really know these guys.

512
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:01,560
What I did know is that they had
all the money in the world...

513
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,360
and not a clue
what to do with it.

514
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,560
Seth, what's up, man?

515
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,000
- Wait outside.
- Hey, man.

516
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,680
Thought you weren't gonna make it, man.
Sit down. Grab a slice. Have a beer.

517
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,800
What's up?

518
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,840
You think he fucked
Hannah or Sheen fucked her?

519
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,120
- Both of 'em.
- Did he just move in?

520
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,360
- He's been here eight months.
- Life all comes down to a few moments.

521
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,360
"This is one of 'em".
Sheen was kind of a pimp.

522
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,240
Shut up, man. Listen. Gecko's coming on.
"What the hell's goin' on?"

523
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,560
I'm lookin' at 200,000 shares moved.
I wanna know if we're part of it.

524
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,840
We'd better be, or I'm gonna come down
and eat your lunch. Back in two, Alex.

525
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,800
Look. I loved it at forty.
Fifty? It's an insult.

526
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,480
Their analysts? They don't know
a preferred stock from livestock.

527
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,480
They wait till it goes down,
and like gumdrops and sperm counts...

528
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,880
This is the kid. Calls me 59 days
in a row. Wants to be a player.

529
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,520
Oughta be a picture of you in the
dictionary under "persistent", kid.

530
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,680
Yeah? Now, listen, Jerry, I'm
looking for negative control.

531
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,200
No more than 30, 35 percent.

532
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,800
Just enough to block
anybody else's merger plans...

533
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,080
and find out from the inside
if the books are cooked.

534
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:43,640
Looks this good on paper, we're
in the kill zone, pal. Lock and load.

535
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,000
Lunch? You gotta be kidding.
Lunch is for wimps.

536
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,120
Okay, Fidel,
I'll talk at you.

537
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,160
Very good.

538
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,760
How do you do, Mr. Gekko?
Bud Fox.

539
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,960
So you say, "Nice to meet you".
Hope you're intelligent.

540
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,040
Where'd you get these?

541
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,160
- I got a connection at the airport.
- Nice job, Mr. Clean.

542
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,800
Hey. Get the fuck off me.

543
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:11,920
- I'm really busy, Seth.
- No. Look, I understand, Doctor.

544
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,440
I'm really busy here myself.

545
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,440
We're gonna come back to you
in one month with one idea only.

546
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,240
If you like what we have to say, great.
We'll do business. If not...

547
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,320
I mean, worst-case scenario, you'll hear
yourself a new business idea...

548
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,080
- That X ray is useless.
- We'll part as friends, right?

549
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:27,800
What?

550
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,040
Are you working with a million
dollars in the market now?

551
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,080
Who is this?

552
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,880
You're a doctor. Have you heard
of a drug called Phenodryl?

553
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,080
It's being manufactured
by M.S. C. Pharmaceuticals.

554
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,160
No.

555
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,520
Well, listen, okay? It's in the
third stage of F.D.A. approval.

556
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,400
Wordis it's gonna be approved
within the next three months...

557
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,360
and it could be tomorrow
for all I know.

558
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,680
But, you know,
I'm getting ahead of myself...

559
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,520
and you're real busy over there...

560
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,240
so why don't I just send you out
the information...

561
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,520
Wait, wait, wait.
Forget the info.

562
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,320
Let's talk about this now.

563
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,800
What was the name
of that drug again?

564
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,480
Could you hold on
for one second?

565
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,520
I'm gonna get...

566
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,560
a senior broker who's a little more
familiar with that particular stock.

567
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,080
All right? Hold on a second.
One second.

568
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,200
Reco!

569
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,360
- Got it.
- Sorry.

570
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,680
His name's Dr. Jacobs,
and I'd say that he's definitely...

571
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,800
- Whoa. I don't wanna hear it, kid.
- Okay.

572
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,600
Hi, Dr. Jacobs?
This is Chris Marlin at J.T. Marlin.

573
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:46,000
- Marlin?
- Right. He's my father.

574
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,240
My associate tells me you're interested
in one of our stocks.

575
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,800
Your wife's on three.
I will call herback.

576
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,120
Yes. M.S. C. sounds like
it might be interesting.

577
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,640
Might be?

578
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,640
"Might be" doesn't sell stock at the
rate M.S.C.'s going for it, Dr. Jacobs.

579
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,280
- We're talking very high volume.
- I still have to run it by my people.

580
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,880
That's great, Doc, if you wanna miss
yet another opportunity here...

581
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,120
and watch your colleagues
get rich doing clinical trials.

582
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,240
- Don't buy a share and hang up.
- Hold on a second.

583
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,800
- I just want to talk about it more.
- Honestly, I don't have the time.

584
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,560
This stock is blowing up right now.
The whole firm's going nuts.

585
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,960
Hold on. Let me open up
the door to my office.

586
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,120
Oh, my God!

587
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,600
See that, Doc?
That's my trading floor.

588
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,480
I have calls to make to a million other
doctors who are already in the know.

589
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,240
I can't walk you through this right now.
I'm sorry.

590
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,320
Okay, okay.
Let's do this.

591
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:49,280
Since you're a new account, I can't go
higher than 2,000 shares. I'm sorry.

592
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:55,040
2,000? Are you nuts? That is way
beyond what I was thinking. 2,000?

593
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,960
Jesus!

594
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,400
Listen. I'm curious. Why can't you
sell me any more than that?

595
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,920
Well, we like to establish a
relationship with our clients...

596
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,200
on something small before we get
to the more serious trades.

597
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,520
Let me show you several
percentage points on this small trade...

598
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,440
and then we'll talk
about doing future business.

599
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,440
That sounds good.
Give me the 2,000 shares.

600
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,480
- Done.
- You sure you can't do better on this?

601
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,520
- I'm sorry, Dr. Jacobs. I can't.
- All right.

602
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,800
- We'll start with this trade, then.
- Great. I promise...

603
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,840
we'll swing for the fences
on the next one.

604
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,560
Do you want that confirmation
sent to your office or your mansion?

605
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,680
Very funny,
Mr. Marlin.

606
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,040
Let me put my secretary on,
and she'll take down your info.

607
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,200
It was a pleasure
doing business with you.

608
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,840
Done and done.

609
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,080
Yeah, baby!

610
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,400
- So, why'd you put a max on his buy?
- What?

611
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,840
Why'd you put a max on his buy?

612
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,680
You didn't tell him
how it works?

613
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,480
He's a trainee. He doesn't need
to know initial sell limits.

614
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,920
Make sure he shows you the ropes, kid.
He's too busy callin' his bookie.

615
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,080
Fuckin' Hebrews. Always lookin' out
for themselves and never the trainees.

616
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,240
- Hey, hey.
- Why don't you go back to Little Italy?

617
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:19,560
Go make me a latke, dreidel boy.
Abrams, look me up on the board.

618
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,280
The reason I capped him
is in case he's a piker.

619
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,360
See, we're gonna front the money
for this sale...

620
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,480
and if he doesn't send the check,
I'm the one holding the bag, follow me?

621
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,400
Right.

622
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,480
Last commission month, the kid on Jim's
team wrote a million-dollar ticket.

623
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,400
Stock was down 3 1/2 points
by settlement.

624
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,440
Fuckin' kid took
a 1/4 million-dollar hit.

625
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,720
- Shit.
- You know how much that hurts?

626
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,120
Besides, the first sell
just whets the appetite.

627
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,240
If he's a whale...
which it looks like he is...

628
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,080
then I'll get him on a day
when there's a real rip.

629
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,600
What's a rip?

630
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,600
A commission.
That's why we work here.

631
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,600
We make huge rips.

632
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,000
No, I don't... I still
don't know how it works.

633
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,800
Okay.

634
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,520
A two-dollar rip, which is unheard of
anywhere on Wall Street...

635
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,760
means that we're walkin' away...

636
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:11,960
with two dollars
for every share we sell.

637
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,920
Real money.
That's opportunity.

638
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,520
Jesus, Greg, you show him
where the bathroom is yet?

639
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,360
Yeah, Seth, I showed you
where Chris's desk is, right?

640
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:24,000
- Richie, do something with this...
- How does Michael afford that?

641
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,280
- Couldn't tell you.
- Okay.

642
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,960
If he's doin' it, he's makin' money
on it. Point is:

643
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,480
Service your client right,
and he'll be back for more.

644
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,080
Show him a three-percent return...

645
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,360
and he'll trust you to
watch his kids for the weekend.

646
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,000
- Abby.
- Hey, Seth.

647
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:55,840
- Hi.
- You wanna go get yourself a drink?

648
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,400
Yeah.
You want anything?

649
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,000
Oh. Okay.

650
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,480
I thought this was supposed to
be a big broker hangout.

651
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:15,800
Merrill Lynch. Salomon Brothers.
Mad, big-dick Steve. What is this place?

652
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,960
This looks like the fucking
Christmas party at Mutual of Omaha.

653
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,080
Yo, check this out.
Joe.

654
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,400
Oh, my God. Would you
look at these monkeys?

655
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,880
So, who do you live with?

656
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,000
You mean, is the little black girl here
takin' care of her grandma...

657
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,040
'cause her mama's
a crack head?

658
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,680
Yeah, exactly. I thought
it was smack, though.

659
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,240
Right.

660
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,440
Boy, you gotta get a hold
of that edge. It's kinda sharp.

661
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:47,240
I know. It's just that
I get so much shit atJ.T....

662
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,080
that sometimes I have
to get in that mode just to...

663
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,600
fend them off of me, you know?

664
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:56,640
Yeah, I was gonna ask you
why are you there...

665
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,400
because it doesn't seem like the ideal
working environment for a black woman.

666
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,680
No, it isn't. It's just that...

667
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,560
how many secretaries do you know
that make 80 grand a year?

668
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,280
- One.
- Exactly.

669
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,160
- "No, no, no. I gotta call the boss".
- Look at this guy. Check it.

670
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,760
No way.
Vito Corleone.

671
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,400
You don't come all my life...

672
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,240
and then you show up
at my daughter's confirmation.

673
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,040
"Are you standin' up or sittin' down?"
By that time I...

674
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:25,680
- How you doin'?
- What's up?

675
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,080
- You guys lookin' for a broker?
- Who the fuck are you?

676
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,440
- Easy.
- I'm not doin' anything.

677
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,480
I thought maybe you were lookin'
for somebody to invest with.

678
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:37,160
- No. Yeah, we're fine. We are brokers.
- You are?

679
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:41,000
- Yeah.
- You guys with Jacoby and Jacoby?

680
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:44,640
- J.T. Marlin.
- Never heard of it.

681
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,440
Hold on a second. Who are you?
What do you sell? Car insurance?

682
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,120
We're with this little firm downtown.
Maybe you've heard of us. J.P. Morgan?

683
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,520
- And I'm a black Negro.
- Right.

684
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,960
I know J.T. It's a fuckin' chop shop.
They named it so it sounds like ours.

685
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,480
He knows that firm.
It's a fuckin' chop shop.

686
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,280
They named the firm to sound
like his. What is he, fucking Yogi Biz?

687
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:07,560
- Shut the fuck up.
- We're not buying it.

688
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:11,720
And what the fuck is with the suits?
You look like you're on Gotti's crew.

689
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,960
- You look great. Seriously.
- Do you know who you're talkin' to?

690
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,080
- Who are we talkin' to?
- You don't know?

691
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,720
Here's Vito and John J r.

692
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,280
I don't wanna get involved in this.
We're not bothering you.

693
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:25,280
We're not.
Patrick, call out the police. Come on!

694
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,840
It's my dad
that's the mess...

695
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,880
but that's not
really interesting conversation.

696
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,920
What about you?

697
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,640
Single mother. No money.
And now I take care of her.

698
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:46,560
- What's wrong?
- She's got chronic pneumonia.

699
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,520
You know, she smoked for, like,
15 years, and now she's really sick.

700
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,640
And it's...

701
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:55,360
She's just really happy that I have
this job so I can support both of us.

702
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,320
- But it's scary sometimes, you know?
- Yeah.

703
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,360
What about your father?

704
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,880
I don't wanna talk
about my father either.

705
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,480
Ready?

706
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,760
- Tell me a story.
- What do you wanna hear?

707
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:25,640
I don't know. Tell me...
Tell me a story about your dad.

708
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,680
Well, I have
so many great ones.

709
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,720
Go on. Tell me.

710
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,080
All right.

711
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,560
Well, I'm ten years old...

712
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,640
and I just
got this new bike.

713
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,680
It's a silver Mongoose,
you know, like BMX.

714
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:54,360
And I'm skidding out in this puddle
like Starsky and Hutch.

715
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:58,000
- Right.
- And my foot slips...

716
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:02,480
and the pedal spins around
hard enough to break my leg.

717
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,440
- Oh, my God.
- But I don't fall off the bike.

718
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:09,600
- I keep going down this hill.
- And I get really scared, you know?

719
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,360
So I jumped off the bike...

720
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,880
and I landed
behind this parked car.

721
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:20,200
And I was laying there
for a good half hour.

722
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,200
And finally...

723
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,800
I hear my father's voice up the street,
and he's calling my name.

724
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,280
And I was so happy...

725
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,680
that he was coming
to get me.

726
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:35,560
And he comes around the car,
and he sees me lying there.

727
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:38,480
I mean, there was...
there was blood everywhere.

728
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,880
Anyway,
I look up at him...

729
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:45,680
and for the first time in my life,
I see how much my father loved me.

730
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,240
- 'Cause he was completely frozen.
- Wow.

731
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,680
You know, it hurt him to see me
in that much pain.

732
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,080
So he leans down
over me...

733
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,800
and he slaps me
across the face.

734
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:04,680
What? Why?

735
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,200
I don't know.

736
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,240
Maybe he was mad at me for
making him feel that helpless...

737
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:17,840
or it was the only thing
he could think of.

738
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,240
I don't really care
anymore.

739
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:24,280
What I think of now is the look
on his face when he saw me lying there.

740
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,880
And that's what I remember.

741
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,160
That's what I miss.

742
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,320
There's your story.

743
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,480
Sorry.

744
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,960
All right. I wanna talk
to you guys about appearance.

745
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:54,080
Okay? Because most ofyou
dress like shit.

746
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,120
I don't know what
your financial situation is...

747
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:59,440
and I don't want to, but you gotta get
yourself at least one decent suit...

748
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:03,360
because we have a minimum level
of aesthetic professionalism here...

749
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,000
that we have to maintain.

750
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,960
In three months, you can outfit
your whole closet...

751
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,640
but for now get something
to hold you over.

752
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:11,680
There's an important phrase
we use here.

753
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,800
I think it's time
you all learned it.

754
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,960
"Act as if".

755
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,080
Do you understand what that means?

756
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,840
Act as ifyou are
the president of this firm.

757
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,200
Act as if you got a nine-inch cock.
Act as if.

758
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,080
And to do that properly,
you need to at least look the part.

759
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,760
So go get dressed. Secondly, it's time
to get your Series Seven books.

760
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,440
Don't get nervous.
Ifyou study, you'll pass.

761
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,680
Then you begin trading
as an S.E.C.-licensed broker.

762
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,760
Then you're a fucking millionaire,
and it's just that simple.

763
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:46,280
I need 300 bucks from each
of you for the books...

764
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,880
which will be returned
if and when you pass the exam.

765
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,280
And I need that tomorrow.
That is all.

766
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,520
What are you?
Last night's erection?

767
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,920
Yeah, well, you know...

768
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,120
What's goin' on?
We're movin' to the big house, kids.

769
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:14,520
Isaac here just closed a guy
for 30,000 shares of Farrow Tech.

770
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,440
We're on the big board.
We're in there now?

771
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,880
- Who's out?
- Todd and company. Come on. Let's go.

772
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:24,720
If you couldn't pull $3,000 together,
your name wouldn't be on my desk.

773
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,640
You're embarrassing me. I'm pitching you
from under my desk. I'm embarrassed now.

774
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,600
Bob. Bob, be rude.
Hang up the phone.

775
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:34,160
You won't.
You wanna know why?

776
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:38,080
Because you see value. I am
your kids' college fund, for chrissakes.

777
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:41,280
I'm gonna pass. The only people making
money passing are N.F.L. quarterbacks.

778
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:44,960
- And I don't see a number on your back.
- Take me off your list.

779
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,680
Fine, fine. I'm gonna take you off
my list of successful people.

780
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,320
Hello?

781
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,480
Hi, Mr. "Dahvis", this is Ron
from the Daily News.

782
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,640
- How you doin'?
- It's Davis, and I'm not interested.

783
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:09,160
- Sorry to bother you. Have a nice day.
- Wait a minute.

784
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:12,920
Wait. That's your pitch?
You consider that a sales call?

785
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,400
You know, I get a call
from you guys every Saturday...

786
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,360
and it's always
the same half-assed attempt.

787
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,560
If you guys wanna close me,
you should sell me.

788
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:23,400
- All right.
- All right. Start again.

789
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:26,720
Okay. Hi, this is Ron
from the Daily News.

790
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,560
- How you doin' this morning?
- Shitty. What do you want?

791
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,200
It's not what I want, sir.
It's what you  want.

792
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:36,200
Ron, now we're talkin'.
All right. What are you selling me?

793
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,920
I'm offering a Daily News subscription
at a substantially reduced price.

794
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,040
We're trying to reach out to people
that never had home delivery before.

795
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:47,320
So everybody who already has a
subscription is getting fucked?

796
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,840
- Yeah. I guess so.
- All right. I can handle that.

797
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,920
So, why should I buy your paper?
I mean, you know...

798
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,400
Why shouldn't I get the Times
or the Voice, you know?

799
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:00,560
The Village Voice is free, sir, so if
you want it, you should pick it up.

800
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:04,280
But the Daily News offers you something
no other paper can.. a taste of New York.

801
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:07,240
We have the best features, more photos
than any other daily in New York...

802
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,560
and we have the most
reliable delivery in the city.

803
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:10,760
Now what do you think?

804
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,800
You know what I think, Ron?
I think that was a sales call.

805
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,440
Good job, buddy.

806
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,080
So you gonna
buy a subscription?

807
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:22,600
No. I already
get the Times.

808
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,720
I know what you're sayin'!

809
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,920
Booked. Booked.
I got a hundred against.

810
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,520
Booked. Someone cover Greg.
Cover Greg.

811
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,960
I hope you guys aren't fightin' over it.
Here. Good money against Greg's roll.

812
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,560
- Put it there.
- Two hundred?

813
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:50,720
- What is that?
- Nothing.

814
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,640
Damn. Who you gotta ass-fuck
to get a ten around here?

815
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,720
- There's a leprechaun in stall four.
- Whatever.

816
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,560
Hey, Seth, I'm gonna get some reserves.
You wanna come with me?

817
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,000
- Yeah.
- You guys want a shot?

818
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,920
Roll a seven, baby. Let's go.

819
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,120
Quit starin'
and just apologize.

820
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,840
Hey, he doesn't have to say shit,
all right?

821
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:14,000
Why don't you go back to your Heineken
and shut the fuck up, okay?

822
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:17,280
Was I talkin' to you?

823
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,720
No, you weren't.
You were talkin' to him.

824
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,800
If you're talkin' to him, you're talkin'
to me and my whole fuckin' crew, okay?

825
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:27,520
Get the fuck outta here.
What? What?

826
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,440
Get the fuck outta here before
I put you in a mayonnaise jar, okay?

827
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,480
Get the fuck outta here,
fuckin' cocksucker.

828
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:43,440
He's gonna cry
like a little baby!

829
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,600
You little baby!

830
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:49,200
Hey, Richie!
Hey, Richie!

831
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:52,240
Oh, Mommy!

832
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,640
Come on.

833
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,040
You gotta realize these aren't the kids
you and I grew up with, you know?

834
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:10,080
Remember in Hebrew school,
when a shoving match was a big deal?

835
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,880
Worst-case scenario, somebody
got their yarmulke knocked off.

836
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,920
It's true, man.
These guys are no joke.

837
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,080
They get all tanked up,
throw a quick fist.

838
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,080
Some of them actually enjoy it.

839
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,800
I mean, like, Richie.
What the fuck is that, man?

840
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,040
Probably thought I was being
tough back there with that guy.

841
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,000
I was shitting my pants.

842
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,480
- I saw that.
- Oh, great. Thanks.

843
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:38,080
These fuckin' Guineas, man.

844
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,600
Half of them do coke.
They all drink. Zero capital.

845
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,320
No fuckin' stability. They
make all this fucking money...

846
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:46,680
and they're always
living three steps ahead.

847
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:49,920
You know, there's guys who work at the
firm that make a million a year...

848
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
and they can't even get a fucking
car loan 'cause their credit's so bad.

849
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,400
It's like everybody is just waiting
for the 15th of the month.

850
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:58,400
They may have a Porsche, but they don't
have ten bucks to put in the gas tank.

851
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,280
- No shit.
- It's nigger rich.

852
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,120
What is this guy doin'?
Yo!

853
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:19,160
- All right. Thanks, man.
- Don't forget what I said about Abby.

854
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:22,080
I think she's trouble,
you know?

855
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,240
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

856
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,240
I don't know.
I've just worked there a long time.

857
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,640
Just looking out for my friends.

858
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:32,000
I think she's a whore.
Just telling you.

859
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:35,240
Well, it's a good thing
you stopped dating her, then, right?

860
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,840
- I'll see you later.
- All right. See you.

861
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:45,400
Of all the people atJ.T. Marlin,
you picked this kid, Davis. Why?

862
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:48,680
'Cause he's perfect. He's new,
so his loyalties don't run too deep.

863
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,680
He also seems to be the smartest
of this last group of trainees.

864
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:55,160
The rest of them are fuckin' idiots
compared to this kid.

865
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:58,480
He used to run a full-time casino
out of his house in Queens.

866
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:03,040
Now he just picks up the checks.
He'll turn state's, no question.

867
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,800
How are you gonna get to him?

868
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,120
We started surveillance.
We'll get to him.

869
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,960
Hey, Jeff!

870
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,520
Hey, Jeff, get up here!

871
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,800
What's goin' on?

872
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,720
One week I can understand,
but it's approaching five weeks now...

873
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:40,160
and the profits are down 40% since
the last week I was here full-time.

874
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:43,400
I'm not you. I'm not gonna
fuckin' kill myself for half the profit.

875
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:46,760
You get to come in here and just pick up
your fuckin' money, and it sucks.

876
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,560
What?

877
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:52,720
Hey! Hey, you know what?
This is my business.

878
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,840
You used to make
ten dollars an hour.

879
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:58,080
Now you're making 1,000 a week,
and you're still not happy?

880
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:02,080
- What the fuck is going on?
- Nothin'. You can check the tapes.

881
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,120
For what? I didn't say anything.
Are you skimming?

882
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:07,560
No! No, I'm not skimming,
all right?

883
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,680
I can't handle a 24-hour gig
all by myself.

884
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,080
This isn't fuckin' Denny's.

885
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,240
You know? I'm tryin'
to finish school here, man.

886
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:17,000
All right. All right, so...
Look, why don't you do this?

887
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,320
Why don't you take on
another partner...

888
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:24,880
and you can split your share
with him, which I'll up to 65%...

889
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,920
and then you can go to school
during the day and work at night.

890
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,400
I'm already doin' that.

891
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:34,800
- You are?
- Yeah.

892
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,680
I took Dave on
last month.

893
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,760
And you still can't
fuckin' handle it?

894
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:42,800
- It's a lot of work.
- Fuck!

895
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,000
Fuck.

896
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,160
All right, that's it.
It's over.

897
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,600
I'm shutting it down.

898
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:55,200
And get those kids
out of my fuckin 'house.

899
00:56:55,320 --> 00:57:00,160
By delaying, you simply restrict
my ability to do my job.

900
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,160
Am I? I'm not trying to...

901
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:05,320
Look, I didn't get to where I am today
by losing my clients' money.

902
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:09,600
Put your confidence
in myself and J.T. Marlin...

903
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,160
and I'm telling you,
we'll never have to ask for it again.

904
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:16,200
Put your confidence in myself
and J.T. Marlin...

905
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:19,400
and I'm telling you, you will
never have to ask for it again.

906
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,320
Okay, let's do this.

907
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,280
Great. I'm gonna pass you on
to my secretary.

908
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,920
You call me when
the stock doubles, all right?

909
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,680
Sheryl, make it so, baby!

910
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:35,600
All right. So l got into it.

911
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:38,000
Do you know how good it feels
to close someone?

912
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:41,560
To sell someone?
It's amazing.

913
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:45,520
- What's goin' on?
- Seth just closed a guy for ten large.

914
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:48,080
- Amazing.
- Do you see what...

915
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,800
You're one of us now.

916
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,000
You popped your cherry!

917
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:57,600
- Hey, Seth, come here a second.
- Yeah. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

918
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:04,480
- I just closed a huge account for you.
- Come here.

919
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,320
What are you doing?
Get away from me.

920
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,880
What the fuck are you doing?

921
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:10,320
- What is this? Huh?
- What?

922
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,240
Who told you you could
close your own accounts?

923
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,520
- What?
- You violated an S.E.C. regulation.

924
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,600
You're a fucking trainee.

925
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:20,640
You know, I just figured
I'd take the initiative...

926
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:23,040
and, you know,
make you some money.

927
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,760
Greg, I was standing right next
to him the whole time.

928
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,160
I would've stepped right in if the kid
would have gotten in trouble.

929
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:31,280
You got a cannoli you can
stick in your mouth?

930
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,520
No, you got a menorah
you can shove in your ass?

931
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:35,440
Fuck him. Come on.

932
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:38,160
I don't even give a fuck
about the money, okay?

933
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,000
Do you know what would happen...

934
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,600
if every trainee started
handling their own recos?

935
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:46,400
- The shop would be closed in a week.
- Is this about something else?

936
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,360
What would that be?

937
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,800
Great.

938
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:57,760
Don't you have to go
answer the phones or something?

939
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,920
You know what? Fuck it.
We'll deal with this later.

940
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:11,000
Don't tell me that's why
I'm not hitting it anymore.

941
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,720
Oh, honey, you were
never hitting it...

942
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,720
and he's not
the reason, Greg.

943
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,680
You are.

944
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:08,800
Jesus Christ,
they're all the same.

945
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,920
- What's the same?
- Oh, my God.

946
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,640
You scared me.

947
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,120
I'm sorry.

948
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,280
How long have you
been standing there?

949
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:21,920
I just walked up. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

950
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,600
No, no, that's all right.
Interesting reading?

951
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:29,120
This? No, this is just
the prospectus...

952
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,000
from the last I.P.O.
the firm put out.

953
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:36,480
I know what it is. I was just asking
if you thought it was interesting.

954
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:39,840
You know, you might be the first person
to read a J.T. prospectus.

955
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,000
Really?

956
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:44,920
Yeah. So, what are
you looking for?

957
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:47,640
I'm just looking for
some chocolate love.

958
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:53,840
You know what? Would you like me
to practice my pitch?

959
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,920
- 'Cause I know it turns you on.
- Oh, God.

960
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,360
You know, I saw John Feiner...

961
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,640
shredding a bunch of documents
the other day.

962
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,680
You don't think that's weird?

963
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:15,040
You say you like the hard sell
and the money.

964
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:16,960
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

965
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:21,200
And then you question it the minute
you see something a bit off.

966
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,600
No, I'm serious.
Either you need to admit to yourself...

967
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:29,760
that it's not charity work
and enjoy it, or get out.

968
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:36,520
But you cannot keep going back
and forth like this. It's ridiculous.

969
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:46,440
Can you buy a bigger bed
when you get some money, please?

970
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:49,400
How big is yourbed?
Bigger than this one.

971
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:52,560
You have a huge bed?

972
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,240
- Hello?
- Hi, Harry. Seth Davis atJ. T. Marlin.

973
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:01,160
- How are you doing this morning?
- Fine, thanks.

974
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,080
You got a call from
an associate last month.

975
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:05,280
I wanted to know if you enjoyed
the information we sent you.

976
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:07,720
What information?

977
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,000
If you get as much mail as I do,
you probably brushed it aside.

978
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:13,080
But more importantly, we made
a commitment to get back to you.

979
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:16,160
Listen, I'm presenting you with
an investment opportunity...

980
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,920
that I think you'll find interesting.

981
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,560
I'm not in the market for that.

982
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:22,400
Tell me, Harry, are you married
or are you happy?

983
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,880
Actually, I've been married
for ten years.

984
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,680
Oh, yeah? That's great.
Yeah, six years for me.

985
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:31,000
So, listen. Are you
playing the market at all?

986
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,880
I don't know about playing.
I do own some blue chips.

987
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:36,280
They were actually
wedding gifts from friends.

988
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:39,720
Listen, we have an explosive situation
going on right now.

989
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,680
A pharmaceutical company,
Farrow Tech...

990
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:45,560
has a drug called Parattin
in the third stage of F.D.A. approval.

991
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:47,480
- What's it do?
- That's a goodquestion.

992
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,840
That's a very good question,
and this is the best part.

993
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,040
It helps premature babies
develop properly.

994
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:54,000
- That sounds like a good drug.
- It is. It is.

995
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:57,960
So, those blue chips you own, what have
they done since you got married?

996
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:01,040
- Not that much, really.
- We deal in stocks that really move.

997
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:03,440
Oh, yeah.
They really move.

998
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:07,280
I'd love to show you what I mean,
and I can do so on a small investment.

999
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:09,200
I really can't
buy anything right now.

1000
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,560
My wife and I are getting ready
to buy a house this month...

1001
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:14,240
and we're trying to save
every last penny.

1002
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,720
Look, I don't care
how much stock you pick up.

1003
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,400
I just want you to test me out.

1004
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:21,320
I want you to judge me
on the percentages I show you.

1005
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,480
I show you 30 or 40%, no matter how big
or small your position is...

1006
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:27,840
you're gonna get excited
about my next idea, right?

1007
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:30,080
- Yeah.
- You'd hand out my business cards.

1008
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:34,360
Right? Do this:
Pick up a hundred shares.

1009
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,680
It's the absolute firm minimum.
If I show you...

1010
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:38,800
three or four points on the trade,
it's not gonna make you rich.

1011
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,320
On the same token,
if the stock doesn't go anywhere...

1012
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,240
you're not in front of your store
with a cup in your hand.

1013
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:46,560
- No, that's true.
- Look, the truth of the matter is...

1014
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:49,000
I could sell you more
than 100 shares...

1015
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,880
and feel completely
comfortable about the trade.

1016
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:55,120
But I'm asking you to start small
just to prove what I can do for you.

1017
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:59,200
All right.
Let's try it.

1018
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:02,560
Great. Should I send the confirmation
to your business or your home?

1019
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,640
I need to talk to my wife.

1020
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,720
No, you don't need to do that.
I'll call you right back.

1021
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:09,680
- I'm goin' to lunch in five minutes.
- I need to talk to her first.

1022
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,960
- Harry, you're at work, aren't you?
- Yeah.

1023
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,640
What do you do for a living?

1024
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:16,480
I'm a purchasing manager
at a gourmet foods company.

1025
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:19,120
- Does your job involve decisions?
- Of course.

1026
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,320
When you're making decisions, do you
call your wife and ask her what to do?

1027
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,240
Of course not.
But that's a little different.

1028
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:27,040
How is that different?
It's your money. You earned it.

1029
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:30,360
All you're doing is investing it.
I'm not selling crack here.

1030
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:32,040
She's only gonna be happy...

1031
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:34,360
when she sees that you made
a wise investment for the family.

1032
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,480
Just think of the flip side.
When your wife does the shopping...

1033
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:39,760
does she call you to find out if she can
use a coupon for Cap'n Crunch?

1034
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:43,200
- Now, come on. That's not being fair.
- No, I know.

1035
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:47,480
Look, Harry. I'm just trying
to make a point here.

1036
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:51,040
Look, we're not talking about
a lot of money here.

1037
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:55,360
Just think what she'll say when you
bring home a big fat check...

1038
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:59,720
because you had the foresight
to see a good thing coming.

1039
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:05,200
- All right. Let's try it.
- Goodman, Harry.

1040
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,360
You made a great decision,
all right?

1041
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,600
Hold on a second.
Do it.

1042
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:15,240
Hello?

1043
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:17,800
- Yo.
- Hey, what's up?

1044
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,240
You passed the Series Seven.
Decide where we're celebrating tonight.

1045
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:24,200
I was thinking that we should
go to the city tonight...

1046
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:26,520
'cause we're always drinking
at those shitty local bars.

1047
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:29,600
I think we should go to
a decent bar with some decent poo-poo.

1048
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:32,160
If I have to look at one more
housewife smoking a Newport...

1049
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:34,160
I think I'm gonna puke.

1050
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:37,040
Let me round up the guys.
We'll come pick you up.

1051
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:38,800
- All right.
- You got it.

1052
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:40,240
Okay, bye.

1053
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:45,120
This guy probably got more rooms
in there than he's ever even been in.

1054
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,720
Look at it.
It's fuckin' huge.

1055
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:50,720
Hey, Chris, why do you
still live with your mother?

1056
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,640
What do you mean?

1057
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,760
Do you ever wonder
how we make the rips that we do?

1058
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:10,440
How is it that we make rips
that pay out...

1059
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:12,400
more than any other
major firm?

1060
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:15,440
You're kidding me, right?

1061
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,040
That's the wrong...

1062
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:19,400
That's the wrong question
to be asking.

1063
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:21,640
- Why?
- The only thing to worry about...

1064
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:24,040
is how you're gonna
get laid tonight.

1065
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:28,040
No, I'm serious.

1066
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:30,720
Don't you know that
S.E.C. regulations state...

1067
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:34,120
that the maximum rip allowed
is five percent of the sale...

1068
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,520
and we're making, like,
four times that?

1069
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:41,800
You just passed your Series Seven;
now you're an inspector or something?

1070
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:44,680
- Aren't you happy with things?
- Yeah, of course.

1071
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:47,480
No, I'm just curious.
You're not curious?

1072
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,800
Not at all.
I like being a millionaire.

1073
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,320
And you will too,
believe me.

1074
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,680
- What's up?
- You need help?

1075
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:00,160
- With what?
- Getting into the fuckin' child's seat.

1076
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:02,080
Come on.
Shotgun.

1077
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:09,160
Why did the feminist
cross the road?

1078
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:12,040
To suck my fuckin' cock.

1079
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:16,480
- That's funny.
- Damn straight.

1080
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:19,240
- Order me another one.
- Who U.A.T.'d this beer for me?

1081
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:22,120
- I did. What's up?
- I hate it. Send the shit back.

1082
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:25,080
- What's a U.A.T.?
- Unauthorized trade.

1083
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:27,280
Seth, anything killing you yet?

1084
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:31,280
All right, yeah.
You know what I fuckin' hate?

1085
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:35,240
Is getting past the secretaries.
It doesn't matter if you're a broker.

1086
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:38,760
It's still a sales call,
and they fuckin' know that.

1087
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:41,320
- One day I'm gonna open a firm.
- Hold on a second.

1088
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:42,840
You're opening things now?

1089
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:44,840
Kid just passed his test;
now he knows everything.

1090
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:48,680
What's wrong with you? You haven't
even popped your cherry yet.

1091
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:54,600
Hey, whatever.
Let's toast the slut. Here you go.

1092
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:57,800
Bring it up for the kid.
Highest Series Seven score this month.

1093
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:01,280
Big swinging dick,
enjoy it while it lasts.

1094
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:07,360
Do you guys think you could
just try and keep it down some?

1095
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:10,960
You guys are at a ten.
We could use you at a two.

1096
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:13,040
- You got to be kidding me.
- I'm sorry about that.

1097
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:17,240
Why don't you just concentrate
on your food instead of us, all right?

1098
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:20,040
What are you guys eating?
A tube steak smothered in underwear?

1099
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:26,480
Hey, great outfits.

1100
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,440
You guys coming from
a city council meeting...

1101
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,920
or are you trying to get lucky
with the bridge-and-tunnel crowd?

1102
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,960
You tell 'em, girl.

1103
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:36,080
You know what they should do
with you guys?

1104
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:39,440
They should throw all ofyou
on a fucking island somewhere.

1105
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:42,000
- Oh, yeah. Hey, guess what.
- What?

1106
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,800
You're on it.

1107
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:48,560
He got a point.

1108
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:51,080
Way to go, girl.

1109
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:53,600
Here you go.

1110
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:01,400
You take it.

1111
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:05,240
Hey, Harry,
who's J.T. Marlin?

1112
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:08,800
I forgot to tell you.
I bought a little bit of stock.

1113
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:11,440
What'd you buy?

1114
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,560
It's this pharmaceutical company.
It's poised for a big jump.

1115
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:15,960
They make a new drug that helps...

1116
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:18,120
premature babies
survive the first three months.

1117
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:20,760
That's great.
Yeah, that's great.

1118
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:25,200
- So how much did you buy?
- Nothing crazy. J ust 1 00 shares.

1119
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:28,440
- At what price?
- Eight dollars. It's okay. Relax.

1120
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:32,480
Okay. So, how'd you
even know who to call?

1121
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:35,160
- Actually, he called me.
- Who did?

1122
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:37,640
Seth Davis, the broker.

1123
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:40,760
He's a really great guy.
He's a family man, actually.

1124
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:43,440
How did he
get your name?

1125
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:45,680
- I have no idea.
- Doesn't that worry you?

1126
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:48,520
It's just... It's okay.
Relax, all right?

1127
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,600
- Okay.
- It's a small investment.

1128
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:53,000
And I'm just
testing this guy out.

1129
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:57,280
If he doesn't show us any gains,
I won't do business with him again.

1130
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,200
Okay.

1131
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:02,400
I don't know why the hell
I walkedin there.

1132
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,320
Things were going well forme.

1133
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:08,000
I had passed the Series Seven
and was closing my 40 accounts for Greg.

1134
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,560
I didn't wanna go in.
I really didn't.

1135
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:14,320
But part ofme had to know what Michael
was doing in there the week before.

1136
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:16,680
And why would they be walking
into the building next door?

1137
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:18,760
The place was empty.

1138
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,760
I should've just let it go.

1139
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,200
- Do we have parking?
- Again? Why?

1140
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:35,040
I want the garage.

1141
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,920
Do we have the same
security guy or what?

1142
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,840
- Are these hooked up?
- Yeah. All that stuff.

1143
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:43,120
If the heat comes and we have to jump,
how long will it take to move the firm?

1144
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:45,680
- Under two hours, literally.
- Everything.

1145
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,560
- They'll can make calls that afternoon.
- Okay.

1146
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:51,680
All right. I gotta get back
to that phone call, but...

1147
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,840
My first thought was that we
were moving to nicer offices.

1148
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,400
Nice thought.

1149
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:00,320
I came to realize it was a quick out
for Michael if things got out of hand.

1150
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:13,560
Miss Halprin. Special Agent Drew, F.B.l.
This is Agent Etkin.

1151
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:16,760
We'd like to talk to you about
your relationship with Seth Davis...

1152
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:19,160
and about your mother's health.

1153
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,640
Didn't take me long
to close the 40 accounts.

1154
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:28,080
I was closing five a day, sometimes six.
Just killing it.

1155
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:30,640
Greg certainly didn 't
make it easy, though.

1156
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:32,160
But I was focused.

1157
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:34,800
I was about to start making
the serious dough.

1158
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:37,360
I was about to be on my own.

1159
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:40,480
All right. At the house.
Sheryl. Yes!

1160
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,960
My first whale. My first account.
My book, baby.

1161
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:47,080
Seth, I hate to bust in
on your little victory speech...

1162
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:49,880
but that's your 40th account.

1163
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:53,200
I'm out of the junior broker program.
I don't work for you no more.

1164
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:57,960
That's true. You're out,
but that account's mine.

1165
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:02,040
What? Fuck that.
No, I keep the 40th.

1166
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:05,760
- No, you don't.
- What?

1167
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:08,640
Wait a minute.
Is this about Abby?

1168
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:11,640
Are you that
fucking bitter?

1169
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,440
I made a lot of money for you
in the past three months.

1170
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,720
More than any other trainee.

1171
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:19,040
You're not listening to me, all right?
I couldn't do it if I wanted to.

1172
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:21,600
What... Rules are rules, man.

1173
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:24,400
Oh, man!

1174
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:27,400
Don't be a dick.
You know you can bend the rules.

1175
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:29,680
I gave each one of my guys their 40th.
Come on.

1176
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:33,480
Do me a favor. Shut your fucking mouth.
Okay? I'm not talking to you.

1177
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:36,240
You know what? Fuck you.
Fuck you!

1178
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:45,800
You're on my team.
You understand that?

1179
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:49,800
I am not on yours.

1180
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:51,960
Don't you ever
forget that, bitch.

1181
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:16,680
How's everybody doing?

1182
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,720
I wanted to congratulate
you all on a huge month.

1183
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:22,320
For any ofyou
not yet convinced...

1184
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:27,280
these were the top dogs of the month:
Jim Young, $280,000;

1185
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:30,200
Chris Varick, $205,000;

1186
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:33,120
and Greg Weinstein, $190,000.

1187
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:37,160
This month's gonna be bigger.

1188
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:39,880
It's actually gonna be
the biggest month we ever had.

1189
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:45,240
I got a new issue I wanna
talk to you about. Okay?

1190
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,040
It's called Med Patent.

1191
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:51,600
They just designed the world's
first retractable syringe.

1192
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:55,080
That means that nurses
and doctors will never again...

1193
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:57,680
have to worry about infection
from dirty needles.

1194
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:01,000
This is not going to be an alternative
in the medical world.

1195
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:03,400
This is gonna be the standard.

1196
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:07,280
We all know that we're here
to make money.

1197
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:10,120
But if we can do something good
like this, it's all the better.

1198
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:13,600
So I want you to go out...

1199
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:17,600
and buy yourselves
a new car.

1200
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:20,840
Go buy yourself a house.
Go into debt.

1201
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:23,720
You are gonna make a million dollars
inside of six months.

1202
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:32,000
Now onto matters of recreation.
We're gonna take a class trip tonight.

1203
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:36,960
So call your moms
and tell them not to wait up!

1204
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:59,720
We're players now, boys!
Let's celebrate! Salute!

1205
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,680
What's wrong?

1206
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,600
Nothin'.

1207
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,600
Seth, I know you.

1208
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:29,920
Just work.

1209
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:32,840
It's your father, isn't it?

1210
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:36,320
No, no, everything's great
with my dad.

1211
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:41,480
He's taking me out to lunch next week
on his request.

1212
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:47,760
- Do you know how happy that makes me?
- I do.

1213
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:50,720
You know... I mean,
it's all based on this job...

1214
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,920
this very legitimate,
respectable job...

1215
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,440
that he can tell his friends about
during the Yom Kippur appeal.

1216
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,880
But I'll take it.
I mean...

1217
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:03,240
Oh, fuck.

1218
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:06,400
I'm so fuckin' close.

1219
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,560
You know?
And I'm fucking it up.

1220
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,600
I mean, I...

1221
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:13,520
How are you
fucking it up?

1222
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:17,200
I went to the Med Patent office
this morning, and there isn't one.

1223
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,120
It's cardboard.
There's nothing.

1224
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:20,960
There's no employees.

1225
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,360
There's no research
and development. Nothing.

1226
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,480
I found out how Michael's
making his money.

1227
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:29,120
We're selling stock
for companies that don't exist.

1228
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:33,440
- Do you know what bridge financing is?
- No.

1229
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:36,480
Basically,
it's a way to raise capital...

1230
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:39,400
for a company that's
trying to go public.

1231
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:41,640
They get money
from outside investors.

1232
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:44,960
They're the bridge.
And it's perfectly legal...

1233
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:48,800
as long as there's no connection
between the investors and the firm.

1234
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:52,800
But Michael's fronting his friends
as the investors on every I.P.O. we do.

1235
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,760
So that's why all the names
on the contracts are the same.

1236
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:00,560
Right. Then he has us
push it all on the open market.

1237
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:02,680
We're basically selling
Michael's shares.

1238
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:04,600
That's where
the two-dollar rips come in.

1239
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:07,480
He can pay us that much,
and it's worth it for him...

1240
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:11,200
because he depends on us
to literally create the market for him.

1241
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:15,360
There's no other firm selling this shit.
It's all artificial demand.

1242
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,360
As soon as we
sell off his position...

1243
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:20,240
there's no need to maintain
the inflated price anymore.

1244
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:23,280
- We stop pushing it, and then...
- And then it crashes.

1245
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:25,440
Right.

1246
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:29,480
But, I mean, how does that
really affect me?

1247
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:33,280
I'm just selling stock.
There's nothing wrong with that.

1248
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:35,440
So I know now how Michael
makes his own money.

1249
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:37,320
And I know that I'm not working
at Goldman Sachs...

1250
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:38,800
but we already know that.

1251
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:42,920
So how does this
really change anything?

1252
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:46,680
I don't know, Seth.
You tell me.

1253
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:01,720
What?

1254
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:11,080
J.T. Marlin.
How may I direct your call?

1255
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:13,960
I think I'll
just talk to you.

1256
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:19,360
Why are you
calling me here?

1257
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:23,440
Time's running out, Abby.
I need to know what he's doing.

1258
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:27,800
You know what?
I'm getting a little bit tired of this.

1259
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:31,320
I don't even know why I talked to you.
You have nothing on me.

1260
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:33,440
I'm gonna hang up
this phone now.

1261
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:35,360
You're putting all
the deals through.

1262
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:38,480
Your signature's on every sell ticket.
So go ahead, hang up.

1263
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:41,280
We'll send a car over for you
this afternoon.

1264
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,640
Goddamn it,
you fuckin' guys!

1265
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:50,560
I'm gonna
keep this short, okay?

1266
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:52,480
You passed your Sevens
over a month ago.

1267
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:55,520
Seth's the only one that's opened
40 accounts for his team leader.

1268
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:58,320
When I was a junior broker,
I did it in 26 days. Okay?

1269
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:01,200
You're not sending out
press packets anymore.

1270
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,480
None of this "Debbie the
Time-Life operator" bullshit.

1271
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:05,600
So get on the phones!
It's time to get to work!

1272
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:09,280
Get off your ass! Move around!
Motion creates emotion!

1273
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:12,160
I remember one time I had this guy
call me up, wanted to pitch me.

1274
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:15,440
Right?
Wanted to sell me stock, so I let him.

1275
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:17,360
I got every fuckin' rebuttal
out of this guy.

1276
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:19,280
Kept him on the phone
for an hour and half.

1277
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:22,680
Towards the end, I asked him questions
like, "What's the firm minimum?"

1278
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:25,840
That's a buying question. Right there,
that guy's gotta take me down.

1279
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:28,800
It's not like "What's your 800 number?"
That's a fuck-off question.

1280
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:31,600
I was giving him a run,
and he blew it.

1281
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:33,720
To a question like,
"What is the firm minimum?"

1282
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,080
The answer is zero.

1283
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:37,920
You don't like the idea;
don't pick up a single share.

1284
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,560
But this putz is telling me,
you know, "Uh, 100 shares".

1285
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:42,600
Wrong answer! No!

1286
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:44,960
You have
to be closing all the time!

1287
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
And be aggressive.
Learn how to push.

1288
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:49,000
Talk to 'em.
Ask 'em questions.

1289
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:51,080
Ask'em rhetorical questions.
It doesn't matter.

1290
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:53,040
Anything.
Just get a "yes" out of 'em.

1291
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:56,680
"lf you're drowning and I throw a
life jacket, would you grab it?" "Yes!"

1292
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:59,560
"Good. Pick up 200 shares.
I won't let you down".

1293
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:02,680
Ask 'em how they'd like to see
30, 40% returns.

1294
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:04,640
What are they gonna say?
" No"? "Fuck you"?

1295
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:08,040
"l don't wanna see those returns"?
Stop laughing. It's not funny.

1296
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:12,040
If you can't learn to close, you better
start thinking about another career.

1297
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:15,040
And I am deadly serious about that.
Dead fuckin' serious!

1298
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:17,000
And have your rebuttals ready.

1299
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,440
A guy says, "Call me tomorrow"?
Bullshit!

1300
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:23,520
Somebody tells you they got money
problems buying 200 shares is lying.

1301
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,640
You know what I say to that?

1302
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:28,520
I say, "Look, man.
Tell me you don't like my firm.

1303
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:31,880
Tell me you don't like my idea.
Tell me you don't like my necktie.

1304
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:35,680
But don't tell me you can't
put together 2,500 bucks."

1305
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:38,800
And there is no such thing
as a no-sale call.

1306
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:41,160
A sale is made
on every call you make.

1307
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:46,080
Either you sell the client some stock,
or he sells you on a reason he can't.

1308
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:48,680
Either way, a sale is made.

1309
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:52,000
The only question is,
"Who's gonna close?" You or him?

1310
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:56,200
And be relentless.
That's it. I'm done.

1311
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:59,440
When I say this man was a loser,
I was saying to myself...

1312
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:02,280
"What are you doing getting
involved with a divorc?"

1313
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:04,880
It didn't work the first time, it won't
work the second. That's your phone.

1314
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,120
- I should let you go. I'll scoot.
- Yes?

1315
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:10,000
- Hi, Harry. How you doing?
- Seth, did you get my calls?

1316
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:12,200
Yeah, I'm sorry.
It's just been crazy around here.

1317
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:15,800
What's happening with Farrow Tech?
It's down five points.

1318
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:19,120
I think we should...

1319
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:21,560
- I wanna sell it.
- You wanna sell now? The stock's down.

1320
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:23,960
You don't make money
buying high and selling low.

1321
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:28,520
So what's going on?
Tell me why we shouldn't get out now.

1322
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:30,160
All right. Here's the deal.

1323
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:32,800
I told you things would happen
in 60 days. It's only been 20 so far.

1324
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:35,720
The situation here is explosive,
and I wanted to get you involved.

1325
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:40,720
I've been busy gathering information.
The stock's down for tech reasons.

1326
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:43,400
It just came off the restricted list,
but it's still the same company.

1327
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:47,440
As a matter of fact, Farrow's been doing
nothing but signing more contracts.

1328
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:50,080
- It's looking like our next big one.
- Guys, listen up.

1329
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:53,440
Harry, I'm sorry.
Can you hold on a second?

1330
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:56,520
Hey! Shut the fuck up!

1331
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:58,040
I just got word from Michael.

1332
01:21:58,120 --> 01:21:59,800
The rip on Farrow Tech
is now three dollars.

1333
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,640
Harry, listen to this.

1334
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:08,960
Jesus Christ.
What's going on over there?

1335
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:11,840
See what I'm saying? People know!
The whole place is going nuts.

1336
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:15,680
It's already up a point, and it just
came off the restricted list.

1337
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:19,080
I'm advising all my clients
to get in on this, and heavy.

1338
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:21,840
You get the same stock we picked up
at eight, only now it's at four.

1339
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:24,960
- When it was at 8, I said it'd go to 20.
- Yes, you did.

1340
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:27,840
It's still going there, probably higher.
This doesn't change anything...

1341
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:30,120
except you're making more money
than you did before.

1342
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:32,240
I liked it at eight. I love it at four.
It's an average down for you.

1343
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,360
- A what?
- It's called dollar-cost averaging.

1344
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:37,360
If you own 100 shares at 10 dollars,
and you pick up another 100 at 5...

1345
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,400
that's 200 shares
at 7.50 a share.

1346
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:41,400
If I get you involved at 10,
I take you out at 15...

1347
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:43,120
how many points did I make you?

1348
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:45,560
- Five.
- Exactly. But at seven and a half..

1349
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:47,480
if I take you out at 15,
that's 7 1/2 points.

1350
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:50,160
- That's better, isn't it?
- Yeah, but I...

1351
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:52,240
Let me close the door
to my office. One second.

1352
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:58,320
I also have a bullet on it.
A few days ago, Dan Dorfman on CN BC...

1353
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:01,000
put a heavy buy recommendation
on Farrow Tech.

1354
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:04,880
Listen to me. I just called
a broker friend at another firm...

1355
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:08,120
and had him pick me up 50,000 shares
under my sister-in-law's name.

1356
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:10,840
I'm gonna put all my kids
through college with this stock.

1357
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:13,480
I have 1 ,000 more calls to make.

1358
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:17,280
I have to call every one of my clients
and give 'em the same opportunity.

1359
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:19,680
You remember when we first spoke?
I told you that this firm...

1360
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:21,600
only has six or seven
great ideas a year?

1361
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:23,760
Well, this is one
of those ideas.

1362
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:26,640
I remember you saying something
about wanting to buy a house, right?

1363
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:27,640
Yeah.

1364
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:31,280
How'd you like to pay fo rit
tomorrow in cash?

1365
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:35,320
- Are you serious?
- Serious as cancer.

1366
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:39,120
Okay, all I have is...

1367
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:42,240
the 50,000
from our savings account.

1368
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:46,960
Seth, you got a call
on line three.

1369
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:50,600
Look, that's my secretary.
I have to go.

1370
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:54,320
What's it gonna be,
Harry?

1371
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:02,920
This kid is really good.

1372
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:06,960
God, he's gonna
go down hard.

1373
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,520
You think I wanna live in this apartment
the rest of my life?

1374
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,240
Sometimes I wonder.

1375
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:13,360
I'm the one that got the raise.
Try and remember that.

1376
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:17,360
- I'm the one that goes out every day...
- You can't keep using that.

1377
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:19,640
I've told you a million times
that I will get a job.

1378
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:21,760
But you forbid it,
then you use it against me.

1379
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,320
We'll buy the house!

1380
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:25,280
With what?
That was our savings, remember?

1381
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:27,840
The stock's gonna go up!
Seth promised!

1382
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:30,720
No, get out of it.
Sell it all tomorrow morning.

1383
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:45,560
I spoke to Howard Goldberg
over at Prudential.

1384
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:49,680
You lied again,
you unbelievable piece of shit.

1385
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:52,720
You lied to all of us.

1386
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:55,160
He told me
aboutJ.T. Marlin.

1387
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:59,840
It's a chop shop, Seth.

1388
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:03,880
You've been selling
their shit all this time.

1389
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:07,200
How many people have you fucked over?
Tell me. How many?

1390
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:09,080
All that bullshit
about them...

1391
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:11,160
wanting you to know
how the business works.

1392
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:13,760
The great training program,
remember?

1393
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:18,080
All the profits you made
for your customers?

1394
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:22,560
Did you do anything for them?
Did you make them any money at all?

1395
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:28,320
Oh, God. I'm done with you, Seth.
This is it. I've had it.

1396
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,520
I don't wanna
see you again.

1397
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:35,840
I don't want you to come to the house.
I don't want you to call.

1398
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:39,640
This is worse than the casino.
You've been stealing.

1399
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:43,680
Look at me.

1400
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:47,560
You're destroying
people's lives.

1401
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:55,280
I'm telling you,
he's about to make a move.

1402
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:58,960
No! I can't afford
to leave him out there any longer.

1403
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:01,600
This girlfriend of his may have
already tipped him off.

1404
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:04,400
- He could run at any time.
- She hasn't, sir.

1405
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:06,320
How could you
possibly know that?

1406
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:10,240
And if you're right
and she's so loyal to you...

1407
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:13,320
then why hasn't she given us
any information yet?

1408
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:16,720
I want Davis brought in
by the end of the week. Period.

1409
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:20,720
There'll be a lot of heat coming down
'cause of what Farrow Tech did.

1410
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,680
So be smart on the phone.
Calm people down.

1411
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:25,640
The stocks dropped 86%
from yesterday's close.

1412
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:28,080
I don't want people dumping
their shares, understand?

1413
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:31,120
Isaac, I got a Mr. Klastow.
He's super hot.

1414
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:33,080
Fuck! I gotta deal
with this guy now?

1415
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,520
You wanna transfer
your account out? Go ahead.

1416
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,640
You're gonna transfer to some broker
who doesn't owe you shit.

1417
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:42,920
I'm sorry we couldn't foresee this when
we first came to you with the stock.

1418
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:43,840
I lost you $60,000.

1419
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:47,080
There is no one who wants to make
that money back for you more than I.

1420
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:49,840
When's the last time
you closed something?

1421
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:52,040
You couldn't close
a fuckin' window, you moron!

1422
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:58,560
What the fuck is this?
What is this?

1423
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:00,480
You think I'm gonna sign
a sell ticket for you?

1424
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:02,800
What'd I just say?

1425
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:05,080
Get him back on the phone
and explain the situation to him.

1426
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:09,640
Get on the phone! No one is gonna
unload today, you hear me? No one.

1427
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:13,800
You're a mutt.

1428
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:16,360
Seth, I've got a Harry Reynard
on the phone.

1429
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:19,360
Yeah, put him through.

1430
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:24,200
- Hi, Harry. I was gonna call you.
- I want my money back.

1431
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:26,120
- Look, Harry,
- I know you're pissed.

1432
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:29,800
We had a setback, but don't worry.
It's become a gold stock.

1433
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:33,360
I plan to bring you eight or nine points
over the course of this year.

1434
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:36,040
People are talking about it
like it's the next Microsoft.

1435
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:40,000
Listen, I'm in a heap of trouble here.
I need that money back.

1436
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:42,920
It was supposed to be a down payment
for a house for my family...

1437
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,840
and now we're gonna
lose the house.

1438
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:48,160
- It's gonna rebound.
- Seth, I need the money back!

1439
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:50,560
I'm sorry, Harry.
I can't do that.

1440
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:53,200
Please, Seth,
I need the money back!

1441
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:55,840
I have to go.

1442
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:58,560
Hello? Hello?

1443
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:03,360
If he calls back,
I'm not here.

1444
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:14,080
J.T. Marlin.

1445
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:15,920
- Seth Davis.
- May l ask who's calling?

1446
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,320
- It's Harry Reynard.
- He just stepped out for a meeting.

1447
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:22,720
Oh, God! Damn it!

1448
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,600
I wish my dad could've stepped
into the casino just once.

1449
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:38,520
He would've had
to be impressed.

1450
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:43,400
Four employees, an organized payroll,
huge client list.

1451
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:46,560
It's funny looking back.
The illegal business I was running...

1452
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:49,080
was the most legitimate thing
I had going.

1453
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:54,320
I looked my customers in the eye
and provided a service they wanted.

1454
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:57,200
Now, I don't even
lookat my customers...

1455
01:28:57,240 --> 01:29:01,240
and I push them something
they never asked for.

1456
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:09,640
What are you
doing here, Seth?

1457
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:12,600
I thought I told you
I didn't want to see you again.

1458
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,720
I need to talk to you.

1459
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:17,040
What is it?

1460
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:19,040
I want out of the firm.

1461
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:21,280
Great. Leave. I don't care
what you do anymore.

1462
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:24,200
I'll tell you this, your coming here
is unacceptable to me.

1463
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:26,600
- Do you want to cost me my judgeship?
- No.

1464
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:28,200
I can't have any connection to you.

1465
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:31,920
I wanna get out of the firm
like you told me to.

1466
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:34,000
- I just need your help.
- What do you need my help for?

1467
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:36,760
You're getting out.
Fine. Whatever.

1468
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:40,000
I don't care if you stay there or not.
Just get out of here!

1469
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:43,040
I wanted to...

1470
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:46,480
There was this investment
that I wanted to tell you about.

1471
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:49,360
Oh, Seth. Please.
You've gotta be kidding me.

1472
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:52,560
No... I mean,
you can make a lot of money.

1473
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:56,640
- Seth, you listen to me...
- We could make a couple big trades...

1474
01:29:56,680 --> 01:30:00,360
that J.T. Marlin
wants you to invest in...

1475
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:03,720
and then when
the next I.P.O. comes out...

1476
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:07,200
No, stop. Are you asking me
to go in on a stock scam with you?

1477
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:11,360
What, are you out ofyour fucking mind?
Are you nuts? Listen.

1478
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:14,120
I think it's time
for you to...

1479
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:25,720
Do you remember this day?

1480
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:27,680
Yes, of course.
I bought you that bike.

1481
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:31,600
Do you remember what happened
about a month after that?

1482
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:33,960
All right. What is it?
What do you want from me?

1483
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:37,640
Do you remember when I broke...
when I broke my leg?

1484
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:40,080
Yes, Seth, I remember
you broke your leg.

1485
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:45,320
What is it? You were hysterical!
I had to get you to stop!

1486
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:49,920
My fucking leg...

1487
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,240
was broken.

1488
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:54,920
I'm sorry...
I'm sorry I couldn't...

1489
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,240
get the job
that you wanted me to have.

1490
01:30:57,320 --> 01:31:01,400
But... I mean...
Who gives a shit?

1491
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:04,080
'Cause I'm good
at what I do, Dad.

1492
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:06,960
I'm good at what I do!

1493
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:11,400
And the casino...
The casino was a fucking business...

1494
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:14,600
and I ran it
pretty fuckin' well, Dad!

1495
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:17,680
- And to think that I closed it for you!
- Wait, wait.

1496
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:19,680
Wait.
When did you close it?

1497
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:24,200
And then I got this job 'cause I thought
it was what you wanted me to be doing!

1498
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:26,480
Seth, wait a second.
When did you close it?

1499
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:31,040
And I tried... I tried to make
the changes that you wanted me to!

1500
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:33,480
And I'm leaving J.T. now!

1501
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:37,920
I'm just asking you for this one thing.
Just this one thing, please!

1502
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,680
Help your son!

1503
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:47,400
I can't, Seth.
I can't. I'm sorry.

1504
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:06,080
What are you
gonna do now?

1505
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:09,280
I'm still gonna do it.
I have a friend that'll go in with me.

1506
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:11,920
If I do it right,
I can takeJ.T. for at least 300 grand.

1507
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,280
- My father can go to hell.
- Seth, my mom.

1508
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:18,400
- I'm sorry.
- I don't think you should do it.

1509
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,960
- I think you should just quit.
- I told you...

1510
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,960
I've invested
too much time in this.

1511
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:24,880
I have no more money
coming in anymore...

1512
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:27,400
becauseJeff tanked
my fucking gold mine.

1513
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:29,320
I need this.

1514
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:32,480
I could hook you up with my friend
that works over at Smith Barney.

1515
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:34,960
- I know you can get a job there.
- Doing what? Ticket running?

1516
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:39,920
You think coming from J.T. Marlin,
they'll let me trade? No fuckin' way.

1517
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:44,400
Why are you so against this?
What do you care if I pull this off?

1518
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:46,880
This is gonna be great
for both of us.

1519
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:01,440
Seth, I just have
a bad feeling about all this.

1520
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:05,280
- I gotta go.
- Seth, I need to talk to you.

1521
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:07,280
I've just got to
figure something out.

1522
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:09,200
I need to tell you something.
Please don't walk out.

1523
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:11,560
Abby, can you come in here
for a second?

1524
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:16,400
Yeah, Mom, one sec...
Seth. Fuck.

1525
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:18,720
Mommy, what's going on?

1526
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:22,280
Okay. Get that. Let's go.

1527
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:24,960
- Mom, where are we going?
- Let's just go.

1528
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:36,560
Yeah, I know.

1529
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:40,160
You went too far this time.

1530
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:45,080
Well, then, when you'd figured it out,
you should've said something.

1531
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:48,120
No, he certainly
hasn't helped any.

1532
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:55,040
But he loves you, Seth.

1533
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:57,080
Do you know that?

1534
01:33:57,160 --> 01:34:00,000
It's important
that you know that.

1535
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:09,760
Line three.

1536
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:17,560
- Seth Davis here.
- Hi, Seth. How are you?

1537
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:22,520
- Dad?
- Yep.

1538
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:26,000
Listen, can I change your mind
about doing this I.P.O. scheme?

1539
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:28,840
No, I'm sorry.

1540
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:31,280
I've already gone in
with somebody.

1541
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:33,960
Well, then, I'm gonna
help you out with this.

1542
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:36,880
You're gonna do it with me?

1543
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:38,800
No, Seth.
You know I can't do that...

1544
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:41,160
but at least I can make sure
you don't get caught.

1545
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:43,760
I know somebody
over at Ellis Proud...

1546
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:46,240
and they can talk to you
about it.

1547
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:50,320
So, why don't you come over
to the house tomorrow night?

1548
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:52,360
Thank you, Dad.
I'm so glad you called.

1549
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:54,480
Me too.

1550
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:57,240
Okay, kiddo.
Tomorrow night.

1551
01:34:57,320 --> 01:34:59,080
Okay.

1552
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:09,520
So, do you wanna
talk to me, or... I mean...

1553
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:13,080
I don't know
what to tell you.

1554
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:16,560
Let's think about this whole thing.
If you pull this I.P.O. deal off...

1555
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:19,520
and I'm associated with you,
what do you think will happen to me?

1556
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:22,720
- But they can't prove anything.
- Who says they have to?

1557
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:26,920
I'm gonna lose myjob unless I put
some distance between us right now.

1558
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,760
Who cares about that?
I'm gonna take care of you.

1559
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:35,280
Look, you are the one real thing
in my life right now.

1560
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:40,400
Get out of the car, please.

1561
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:45,320
You are under arrest for violation
of 26 S.E.C. and N.A.S.D. regulations.

1562
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:47,800
What the hell is going on
out here?

1563
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:50,280
Seth, I'm gonna get you
out of this.

1564
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:54,600
- Just don't call my father.
- Get back in the car, Abby.

1565
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:09,400
Why is he here right now?
He didn't do anything.

1566
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:11,480
Seth, what the hell
is going on?

1567
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:14,640
- You've been talking to them about me.
- Of course not!

1568
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:18,000
- What is he doing here right now?
- Seth, are you sure?

1569
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:22,240
Of course I'm sure.
I didn't say anything.

1570
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:24,880
All right. That's it.
I am out of here in three seconds...

1571
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:27,480
unless you can
charge me with something.

1572
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:32,960
Can I change your mind
about doing the I.P.O. scheme?

1573
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:36,720
Well, then I'm gonna help you out.
I know somebody over at Ellis Proud.

1574
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:38,920
At least I can make sure
you don' tget caught.

1575
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:43,280
Oh, my God.

1576
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:46,600
So, what
do you want from me?

1577
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:48,680
I want you to testify.

1578
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:52,800
- Well, what are you offering?
- Full immunity.

1579
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:58,200
- And what happens with my father?
- He won't do any time.

1580
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:00,880
Seth, I haven't done
anything illegal.

1581
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:03,080
So, what's the deal, then?

1582
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:06,520
The deal is I lose my judgeship
just going along for the ride.

1583
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:10,600
- I have nothing to do with that.
- What's that supposed to mean?

1584
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:12,680
Are you gonna release the tape
to the press?

1585
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:15,800
Makes your case more glamorous
with the involvement of a federal judge.

1586
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:19,320
- No. No, no. No deal.
- Why?

1587
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:24,040
No, you take my father out the back,
and you bring him home.

1588
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:26,640
He has nothing
to do with this case.

1589
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:30,720
I swear to God, if he ends up
in one newspaper, I do not testify.

1590
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:33,480
And I mean that.

1591
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:36,120
For me, it'd be worth
going to jail for.

1592
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:39,520
- You serious?
- What do you think?

1593
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:48,080
Before we get ahead of ourselves,
just what are you offering?

1594
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:51,840
I'm gonna hand you this case
on a silver fucking platter.

1595
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:55,400
I know everything you don't.
I know how it all works.

1596
01:37:55,480 --> 01:37:57,720
I know how Michael
makes his money.

1597
01:37:57,800 --> 01:37:59,760
I know how he hides it.

1598
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:02,320
I know who he goes in with.

1599
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:05,840
I even know where he moves
if you guys get too close.

1600
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:08,640
I know everything!

1601
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:11,280
So tell me what happens now.

1602
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:14,560
You go back to work tomorrow
like nothing happened, for one day.

1603
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:18,960
I need your client book and your whole
"C" drive backed up onto floppy.

1604
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:28,080
- And we have to hold you overnight.
- Just a minute, please.

1605
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:32,360
Please, I want a couple of moments
alone with my son.

1606
01:38:32,440 --> 01:38:35,520
- I'm sorry...
- David, let's give them a moment.

1607
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:52,880
I am so sorry.
I am so fuckin' sorry.

1608
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:59,360
Seth, just let me speak.

1609
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:04,480
When I came up to you
behind that car...

1610
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:06,960
it was the hardest thing
I ever had to bear...

1611
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:11,040
because all I wanted to do
was make your pain disappear.

1612
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:20,040
I don't even know how
to describe the feeling.

1613
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:28,960
I just want you
to know one thing.

1614
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:35,520
Not a day of my life has gone by
that I don't think about that moment...

1615
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:39,600
that I don't dream about being back
there just to have one more chance.

1616
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:46,640
I am more sorry
than you will ever know.

1617
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:06,960
You know that E!'s got
that bathing suit thing going.

1618
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,120
French Riviera.
It's on tonight.

1619
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:12,840
The guy was an idiot. He acted like
he was from Staten Island. No...

1620
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:16,680
Hi, you've reached the Reynards.
Please leave a message.

1621
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:18,840
Thanks. Have a nice day.

1622
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:20,960
Hey, Harry.
It's Seth Davis.

1623
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:23,200
- Are you there?
- Isaac, your mother on line three.

1624
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:27,040
You know, about the way
things went, I just...

1625
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:32,200
I found a way
to get your money back.

1626
01:40:32,240 --> 01:40:34,240
I just need you
to call me back, all right?

1627
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:37,040
George, get me a coffee.
Thanks.

1628
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:38,960
So call me.

1629
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:56,840
What?

1630
01:40:56,920 --> 01:41:00,520
- Hi.
- What's up?

1631
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:03,920
- I want to talk to you about a client.
- Yeah.

1632
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,360
- His name is Harry Reynard.
- I don't know him.

1633
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:10,760
I think you should,
because we're about to lose him.

1634
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:14,480
He dropped $50,000 on
Farrow Tech this week alone.

1635
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:15,720
And you want to do what?

1636
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:18,880
I want to keep him here.

1637
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:23,120
I think that we should give him
a chunk of the Med Patent I.P.O.

1638
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:25,440
We don't hand out I.P.O. to somebody
who had a bad day on the market.

1639
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:28,400
Look, Michael, this guy
is a fucking whale...

1640
01:41:28,440 --> 01:41:30,760
and he's gonna do an obscene amount
of business with this firm.

1641
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:34,320
- You're somehow sure of this.
- Yeah, the guy completely trusts me.

1642
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:36,480
He doesn't even need the money.

1643
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:38,800
He owns the biggest
foods company in Wisconsin.

1644
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:40,640
He just wants to know
we're gonna do right by him.

1645
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:42,240
How many trades has he made?

1646
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:45,360
Two.

1647
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:48,240
But he made a second trade
a week after I opened him.

1648
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:51,560
Look, the guy's pretty fuckin'
sour on Farrow Tech...

1649
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:52,760
and he's gonna walk.

1650
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:56,560
I just think we need to make him
a little money on this next I.P.O....

1651
01:41:56,600 --> 01:41:58,480
and let him
take it for a ride.

1652
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:00,680
What did Greg say?

1653
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:04,080
He's busy closing somebody.
I didn't want to bother him.

1654
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:07,560
Well, go get him.

1655
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:14,000
Hey, Greg.
Michael wants to see you.

1656
01:42:26,360 --> 01:42:29,360
I don't know what he told you,
but I've had it with this shit.

1657
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:34,160
This is a business, all right?
He should be making calls...

1658
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:38,280
not in here bitching about
personal petty shit between me and him.

1659
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:41,360
Seth was talking about giving
Med Patent I.P.O. to Harry Reynard.

1660
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:44,880
What... Are you
fucking kidding me?

1661
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:47,400
First of all, I don't even
know this guy Reynard.

1662
01:42:47,480 --> 01:42:51,360
No way. He's totally unreliable.
What are you doing?

1663
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:54,400
Guy dropped 50 large
on Farrow Tech this week.

1664
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:59,160
That's great. But I have lots of clients
who deserve I.P.O. more than this guy.

1665
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:00,880
Clients who've been
with me six months...

1666
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:02,600
taken losses
and continue to trade.

1667
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:05,800
- And he's one of 'em, asshole.
- You see what I'm dealing with here?

1668
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:09,520
- What do you mean, "he's one of them "?
- He's one of Greg's clients.

1669
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:10,760
What?

1670
01:43:10,840 --> 01:43:12,640
I opened him when I was
closing my 40 accounts for you.

1671
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:14,720
I'm just his contact here.
He's your client.

1672
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:16,720
I'm not gonna
make a dime off this trade.

1673
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:18,560
No wonder the guy's pissed off.

1674
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:20,800
His own broker doesn't even know
he's a fuckin' client here.

1675
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:25,960
Fine.

1676
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:28,160
Give him 10,000 shares.

1677
01:43:28,240 --> 01:43:30,800
He just can't sell it
before we say so.

1678
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:33,880
- Great. Okay.
- No joke, Seth.

1679
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:36,720
He cannot sell it
before we sell it.

1680
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:40,200
- At least six months, you understand?
- Absolutely. Absolutely.

1681
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:42,960
Greg, I'm sure you don't
have a problem with this.

1682
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:45,320
Can you get the fuck
out of my office?

1683
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:47,240
Fine.

1684
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:53,480
What the fuck are you doing?

1685
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:56,360
Stand up! You cannot sit down
for the rest of the fuckin' day!

1686
01:43:56,440 --> 01:44:00,400
You cannot sit down
ever again! Okay?

1687
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:05,040
Seth, line two.

1688
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:15,120
- Hello?
- It's time, Seth.

1689
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:17,080
Getgoing.

1690
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:49,440
I'm going to lunch, boys.

1691
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:07,600
What's this about?
You okay?

1692
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:13,200
I need you to sign a sell ticket
for a client of mine.

1693
01:45:13,240 --> 01:45:15,320
Fuck Greg!
Let's fuckin' deal with...

1694
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:18,560
- Let's talk to Michael.
- No, wait. Wait, wait.

1695
01:45:18,640 --> 01:45:20,520
Chris, I got arrested
last night.

1696
01:45:20,600 --> 01:45:22,800
What?

1697
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:25,480
The F.B.l. arrested me.

1698
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:28,400
The F.B.l.? Why the fuck
would the F.B.l. arrest you?

1699
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:30,880
Because of my involvement
in this firm.

1700
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:34,720
Your involvement in the firm?
What the fuck does that mean?

1701
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:36,760
Come on, Chris.
You know what that means.

1702
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:38,960
No, I don't know what that means.
What does that mean?

1703
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:42,520
- What the fuck did you tell 'em?
- No. No.

1704
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:47,120
No, they knew everything, man.
They had photographs.

1705
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:50,640
They had... They had
tape-recorded conversations.

1706
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:52,840
They brought my father in,
you know. I mean...

1707
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:56,520
- Chris, there was nothing I could do.
- What did you do?

1708
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:58,960
Chris, the F.B.l. are gonna
raid the place in 20 minutes.

1709
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,800
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1710
01:46:01,880 --> 01:46:03,960
Fuck, Seth!

1711
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:05,920
Come on, man.

1712
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:08,000
I asked you for months
about shit going down here...

1713
01:46:08,080 --> 01:46:09,960
and you told me
to shut the fuck up.

1714
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,040
You said get ready
to be a millionaire!

1715
01:46:12,120 --> 01:46:14,760
That's right. Shut the fuck up.
That's all you had to do.

1716
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:16,280
Didn't you learn anything?

1717
01:46:16,360 --> 01:46:18,320
I learned how to fuck people
out of their money.

1718
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:22,920
Harry Reynard just lost
his life savings.

1719
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:26,160
And he wasn't a whale.

1720
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:31,400
He was just some poor schmuck,
and I took him.

1721
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:35,080
I did everything thatJ.T. Marlin
taught me to do...

1722
01:46:35,160 --> 01:46:37,040
and I made up his mind
for him.

1723
01:46:37,120 --> 01:46:40,840
What do you want me to tell you?
That's what we do here.

1724
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:43,840
What? We lie?
We're liars?

1725
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:48,520
Seth, this...

1726
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:55,240
Who are they coming for?

1727
01:46:55,280 --> 01:46:58,520
They're coming
for everybody, everything.

1728
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:03,200
You know how hard I worked
to get where I am?

1729
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:05,720
No, Chris, you need
to forget about that.

1730
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:07,800
It doesn't mean shit.

1731
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:10,520
Right now at this moment
is what you should be thinking about.

1732
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:13,240
What are you gonna do
in the next 15 minutes?

1733
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:16,960
They're gonna come in here,
and make sure that we never trade...

1734
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:19,360
another share of stock
for the rest of our lives.

1735
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:23,400
- But we can do something.
- What's that?

1736
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:26,160
Harry, my client.

1737
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:29,400
I need a senior broker
to sign a sell ticket...

1738
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:31,240
so he can take his shares...

1739
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:35,800
and dump 'em on the open market
and make his money back.

1740
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:43,080
Come on, Chris. Come on.
What's the difference?

1741
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:45,840
Do one thing right here.

1742
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:49,360
Just sign it, please.

1743
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:58,760
Thank you, Chris.

1744
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:08,320
I'm so sorry.

1745
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:32,240
I'm plagued by "what ifs"
these days.

1746
01:48:32,320 --> 01:48:35,520
What if Greg hadn't
come over that night?

1747
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:38,280
What if I hadn 't
forgotten my bag...

1748
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:40,880
or seen Michael walk
into the building that day?

1749
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:45,760
What if I had
skipped over Harry's card?

1750
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:47,680
What are the chances?
What are the odds?

1751
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:49,440
That's what I think about.

1752
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:52,040
Hey, I ran a casino.

1753
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:59,360
It's the next step I gotta figure out,
'cause I'm no lottery winner.

1754
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:03,960
I tried slinging crack rock,
and I never had a jump shot.

1755
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,840
I gotta find a job.
