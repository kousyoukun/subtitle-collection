Yes.

It's something I tell my kids.

If the fingers are curved, like this,

29
00:02:38,463 --> 00:02:42,460
then there's room for the train

May I ask?

44
00:03:12,499 --> 00:03:15,232
How many teachers
have you had before me?

45
00:03:16,837 --> 00:03:17,770
Four.

46
00:03:17,838 --> 00:03:19,068
Well, for what it's worth,

47
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:22,441
learning an instrument
at your age is difficult,

48
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:27,315
especially if you don't possess
a natural gift for it.

49

I'm not saying this to be mean.

50
00:03:29,884 --> 00:03:36,524
But if you do decide to give up,
I'd really like to buy your piano.

51
00:03:38,526 --> 00:03:39,516
Okay.

52
00:03:52,207 --> 00:03:54,803
Each stage of experience
is really the exception to the rule

53
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:56,278
because the conditions there

Why is it late?

62
00:04:32,116 --> 00:04:34,587
I had some personal

I'm sorry.

Hi, Charles.

00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,285
Sure.

74
00:05:47,396 --> 00:05:48,591
Walter, Shelley can't make it down

75
00:05:48,664 --> 00:05:50,600
to the NYU conference
to present your paper.

76
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,431
I'm gonna need you to cover for her.

77
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:54,298
Why can't she go?

78
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,399
She's been put on bed rest
till she has the baby.

79
00:05:57,473 --> 00:06:00,604
I wish I could, but now is not
a good time, Charles.

80
00:06:00,677 --> 00:06:03,273
Well, I understand,
but you co-authored the paper,

81
00:06:03,345 --> 00:06:04,404
and the Dean wants it presented.

82
00:06:04,481 --> 00:06:05,779
He wants to keep
Shelley on track for tenure.

83
00:06:06,049 --> 00:06:09,216
I just don't think I can,
with the start of classes and my book.

84
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,689
You're only teaching one class, Walter.

85
00:06:12,756 --> 00:06:14,783
So I can stay focused on my book.

86
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:19,491
Charles, I would really rather not go.

87
00:06:19,564 --> 00:06:23,128
Well, I'm sorry, but there really
isn't another option at this point.

88
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,733
Charles, the truth is...

89
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:31,674
this is really Shelley's paper.

90
00:06:31,742 --> 00:06:34,806
I just agreed to co-author it
because she asked me to.

91
00:06:36,481 --> 00:06:38,816
I'm not really prepared to present it.

92
00:06:39,818 --> 00:06:41,116
Now, look, Walter,
you can take it up

with the Dean if you want,

94
00:06:42,421 --> 00:06:46,828

[indistinct chatter]

336
00:23:32,722 --> 00:23:34,351
I'm sorry, guys.
[chuckles]

337
00:23:34,424 --> 00:23:35,357
Yeah, well, let's go.

338
00:23:35,425 --> 00:23:36,826
Very good.

339
00:23:36,894 --> 00:23:37,827
Really? You liked it?

340
00:23:37,895 --> 00:23:38,828
Yeah. It was very good.

341
00:23:38,896 --> 00:23:40,159
I was not sure.

342
00:23:40,231 --> 00:23:42,394
I thought it's too loud and you know.

343
00:23:53,544 --> 00:23:54,534
[door closes]

344
00:24:24,777 --> 00:24:25,938
Tarek?

[drumbeats]

346
00:24:40,961 --> 00:24:41,894
Oh.

347
00:24:41,962 --> 00:24:43,727
[exhales sharply]
Hi.

348
00:24:43,797 --> 00:24:45,733
Sounded good, Walter.

349
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:46,893
I'm sorry. I...

350
00:24:46,968 --> 00:24:48,561
No. Don't be sorry.

351
00:24:48,636 --> 00:24:49,969
That's what it's there for.

352
00:24:51,306 --> 00:24:52,707
[laughs]
I was lying

353
00:24:52,774 --> 00:24:53,833
on my bed, listening to my music,

354
00:24:53,908 --> 00:24:55,571
and then I was, like...

355
00:24:55,644 --> 00:24:57,238
what's that crazy rhythm I'm hearing?

356
00:24:59,981 --> 00:25:02,977
Sit. Come on. I'll show you.

357
00:25:12,828 --> 00:25:14,821
Just put your feet flat on the ground.

358
00:25:16,999 --> 00:25:19,300
Now take the drum
between your legs like this.

359
00:25:19,368 --> 00:25:20,393
[exhales heavily]

360
00:25:23,006 --> 00:25:25,637
Now you want to take
the inside edge off the ground

361
00:25:25,709 --> 00:25:27,302
with your ankles, like this.

362
00:25:28,845 --> 00:25:30,280
Great.

363
00:25:30,348 --> 00:25:31,941
You're okay?

364
00:25:32,015 --> 00:25:33,712
Okay.

365
00:25:33,784 --> 00:25:34,843
Okay.

366
00:25:34,918 --> 00:25:36,581
Now, Walter, I know
you're a very smart man,

367
00:25:36,653 --> 00:25:39,956
but with a drum
you have to remember not to think.

368
00:25:40,024 --> 00:25:41,960
Thinking just screws it up. Okay?

369
00:25:42,026 --> 00:25:43,324
Okay.

370
00:25:43,393 --> 00:25:44,953
Now, give it a couple of bangs.

371
00:25:45,029 --> 00:25:46,258
[sighs deeply]

372
00:25:49,367 --> 00:25:50,892
Not so hard. You're not angry at it.

373
00:25:50,969 --> 00:25:52,563
Okay. I'm sorry.

374
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:55,029
Okay.

375
00:25:59,044 --> 00:26:00,980
Better. Did you think?

376
00:26:01,046 --> 00:26:01,979
No.

377
00:26:02,047 --> 00:26:03,744
Good.

378
00:26:03,816 --> 00:26:05,479
Now, one more thing, Walter.

379
00:26:05,551 --> 00:26:07,987
You listen to classical music,
so you think in fours.

380
00:26:08,053 --> 00:26:09,990
1, 2, 3, 4.

381
00:26:10,056 --> 00:26:12,322
Dah, dah, dah, dah.

382
00:26:12,392 --> 00:26:13,485
This is an African drum,

383
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:14,960
so we're gonna be playing in threes.

384
00:26:15,028 --> 00:26:15,996
Tak tak tak.

385
00:26:16,062 --> 00:26:17,554
You have to forget your classical.

386
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:19,657
Leave it behind. Tak tak tak.

387
00:26:19,732 --> 00:26:20,995
1, 2, 3.

388
00:26:21,067 --> 00:26:22,057
Come on, follow me.

389
00:26:23,069 --> 00:26:24,333
Tak tak tak.

390
00:26:24,405 --> 00:26:25,464
Tak tak tak.

391
00:26:25,538 --> 00:26:26,904
1, 2, 3.

392
00:26:30,911 --> 00:26:32,004
Don't worry. Start again.

393
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:33,012
Good.

394
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,070
Don't worry.

395
00:26:35,516 --> 00:26:36,507
Again.

396
00:26:42,089 --> 00:26:43,079
Good.

397
00:26:45,927 --> 00:26:47,623
You got it.

398
00:26:47,695 --> 00:26:49,028
- [falls out of rhythm]
- Go...

399
00:26:49,097 --> 00:26:50,588
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

400
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,659
Don't worry. Go again.

401
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,399
Good.

402
00:27:03,446 --> 00:27:04,414
That's it.

403
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,677
Now, keep it going, and I'll do this.

404
00:27:06,749 --> 00:27:08,742

413
00:28:05,177 --> 00:28:06,110
Hello.

414
00:28:06,178 --> 00:28:07,943
Hi.

415
00:28:08,013 --> 00:28:09,106
[breathing heavily]

416
00:28:09,182 --> 00:28:10,115
Is Tarek home?

417
00:28:10,183 --> 00:28:14,123
Uh, no. He, uh...
he went to look at another apartment.

00:28:14,187 --> 00:28:15,450
[panting]

419

Are you okay?

420
00:28:16,689 --> 00:28:18,124
Yes.

421
00:28:18,191 --> 00:28:20,924
Tarek's been giving me drum lessons,
and I was just practicing.

422
00:28:20,994 --> 00:28:23,021
[breathing heavily]

423
00:28:25,866 --> 00:28:28,599
Don't worry. I'll keep my pants on.

424
00:28:30,037 --> 00:28:31,027
What?

425
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:33,439
Nothing.

426
00:28:33,507 --> 00:28:34,874
It's just that earlier, uh...

427
00:28:36,677 --> 00:28:38,202
No, nothing.

## [saxophone]

432
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:30,200
Which is due, in large part,

433
00:29:30,267 --> 00:29:33,205
to the delay in African infrastructure

434
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:36,675
and the slowdown on steel imports.

How did the presentation go?

Oh, fine. Thanks.

Cool.

00:30:10,277 --> 00:30:11,210
- You ready?
- Yeah.

00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:12,211
Let's go.

00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:14,078
- Can you grab this drum?
- Yeah.

444
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:15,080
Okay.

445
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:17,779
You might want to take off
your, uh, name tag.

446
00:30:17,851 --> 00:30:18,841
Oh, okay.

447
00:30:22,823 --> 00:30:23,756
You hungry?

448
00:30:23,824 --> 00:30:25,258
Yeah, I'm starving.

449
00:30:25,326 --> 00:30:26,259
You like shawarmas?

450
00:30:26,327 --> 00:30:28,057
Yeah, I like sharmas.

451
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,821
- [correcting] Shawarmas.
- [chuckles]

452
00:30:35,336 --> 00:30:38,103
Here. This is for you.

453
00:30:38,172 --> 00:30:39,231
For letting us stay.

454
00:30:39,307 --> 00:30:40,606
Oh. Thank you.

455
00:30:43,177 --> 00:30:45,205
It's Fela Kuti. You know him?

456
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,612
Nope.

457
00:30:46,682 --> 00:30:48,083
- You don't know Fela?
- No.

458
00:30:49,184 --> 00:30:51,620
Then, Walter, you're in for a treat.

459
00:30:51,687 --> 00:30:53,281
He started the whole Afrobeat movement.

460
00:30:53,355 --> 00:30:56,225
Oh, and his drummer, Tony Allen,
was just... whoo, scary, man.

461
00:30:56,291 --> 00:30:58,762
You want to play drums,
you have to listen to this.

462
00:30:58,828 --> 00:31:00,091
Okay. I will.

463
00:31:03,031 --> 00:31:04,625
Ooh.

464
00:31:04,701 --> 00:31:05,965
Did you make these?

465
00:31:06,036 --> 00:31:07,299
Yes, I made these.

466
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:08,633
Ooh.

467
00:31:08,705 --> 00:31:10,299
- How much?
- Which one?

468
00:31:10,373 --> 00:31:12,810
Mmm...

469
00:31:12,876 --> 00:31:13,901
this one.

470
00:31:14,911 --> 00:31:16,642
That's $35.

471
00:31:16,714 --> 00:31:17,807
Will you take 30?

472
00:31:17,881 --> 00:31:18,906
No. 35.

473
00:31:18,982 --> 00:31:20,281
Okay.

474
00:31:20,351 --> 00:31:22,844
My daughter will think this is very cool.

475
00:31:23,887 --> 00:31:25,652
Where are you from?

476
00:31:25,723 --> 00:31:26,691
Senegal.

477
00:31:26,758 --> 00:31:29,320
Oh, I was in Cape Town
two summers ago.

478
00:31:29,393 --> 00:31:31,158
It is so beautiful.

479
00:31:32,263 --> 00:31:34,062
- Thank you very much.
- What's your name?

480
00:31:35,232 --> 00:31:36,326
Uh, Zainab.

481
00:31:36,401 --> 00:31:37,835
Zainab!

482
00:31:37,902 --> 00:31:38,892
So pretty.

483
00:31:39,904 --> 00:31:41,396
- Thank you.
- Your change.

484
00:31:47,412 --> 00:31:50,681
How far is Senegal from Cape Town?

485
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:53,381
About 8,000 kilometers.

486
00:31:54,687 --> 00:31:57,090
I told this guy yesterday
I was from Israel.

487
00:31:57,156 --> 00:31:59,752
He asked if I ever visited the Holy Land.

488
00:32:01,928 --> 00:32:04,296
Hey, look who it is!

489
00:32:04,363 --> 00:32:05,296
- Zev.
- What's up, Tarek?

490
00:32:05,364 --> 00:32:06,297
How are you, man?

491
00:32:06,365 --> 00:32:07,298
Good, man.

492
00:32:07,367 --> 00:32:08,300
Hey, honey.

493
00:32:08,368 --> 00:32:09,996
Hi. Hi, Walter.

494
00:32:10,069 --> 00:32:11,002
[Walter]
Hi.

495
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,129
Her stuff is great, right?

496
00:32:12,206 --> 00:32:13,367
Beautiful.

497
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,239
She made me this.

498
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:16,368
[Walter]
It's very nice.

499
00:32:17,444 --> 00:32:19,277
So Walter and I
are goin' up to the park

500
00:32:19,346 --> 00:32:21,373
to play for a little bit, okay?

501
00:32:21,448 --> 00:32:23,213
Tarek. Remember I told you

502
00:32:23,283 --> 00:32:25,014
we have to pick up
my new table today?

503
00:32:25,085 --> 00:32:27,112
He said he'll only hold it for today.

504
00:32:27,187 --> 00:32:28,383
Oh, I know, I know. No problem.

505
00:32:28,456 --> 00:32:32,089
Tarek, you always say "No problem,"
and then you are late or you forget.

506
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,389
I know. I... I will not be long.

507
00:32:33,461 --> 00:32:35,898
We will go up and play,
and we'll come back to help you.

It's always <i>habibti</i>

00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,730
Good-bye.

No Arab time.

No, not Arab time.

00:32:59,021 --> 00:33:00,148
What does <i>habibti</i> mean?

00:33:00,222 --> 00:33:02,455
<i>Habibti?</i> It means "beloved one."

Why haven't you?

525
00:33:25,183 --> 00:33:26,948
Maybe we could do it together...

It was just a misunderstanding.

How could this happen?

He wouldn't do anything wrong.

No, I went down to the precinct

To a detention center in Queens.

He was turned over to Immigration.

tomorrow night.

I'll leave some in the fridge.

How did you get out?

Well, he's not here now.
That's all I know.

Walter. Thank you for coming.

Of course.

How is Zainab?

She's upset. Um...

681
00:44:14,035 --> 00:44:16,802
I have a... a letter from her.

682
00:44:16,872 --> 00:44:18,135
Oh, you can't give it to me.

683
00:44:18,206 --> 00:44:20,803
It has to be sent to me by mail.

Oh.

685
00:44:23,212 --> 00:44:25,205
But... But you can put it up to the glass.

Go ahead. Open it up

So how are they treating you?

It's very depressing here.

Well... Zainab and I met
with a lawyer today.

Yes? What did he say?

Well, he's... he's gonna
stop by tomorrow and see you.

Tarek. Zainab said
that you were denied asylum.

You mean when we came here?

Yeah.

706
00:45:36,823 --> 00:45:39,293
Did you go to your deportation hearing?

707
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:41,051
Yeah.

00:45:41,127 --> 00:45:42,220
In Michigan.

709
00:45:42,295 --> 00:45:43,992

I'm going to go
stay with him for now.

You don't have to go.
You can stay here.

I think it's better I leave.

Um... you know how to reach me
if you need to.

Is it okay if I leave
Tarek's things here for now?

We did. I remember it.

Well, then why is there
a final order out on you?

He didn't know yet. He just said

that unless they can find a way
to reopen the case quickly,

758

Tomorrow.

774
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:52,798
But I'll be reachable
by phone if you need anything.

775
00:48:52,864 --> 00:48:56,098
And I'll be back to visit. It's not far.

Don't worry. They can't arrest you.

- the wrong apartment.
- Can I help you?

are you Tarek's mother?

I j...

812
00:50:50,121 --> 00:50:51,612
I share the apartment with him.

813
00:50:53,291 --> 00:50:55,386
He didn't mention
that he lived with someone.

814
00:50:56,628 --> 00:50:58,153
Well, I'm not here very often.

815
00:50:58,229 --> 00:50:59,630
I... I live in Connecticut.

816
00:51:00,632 --> 00:51:02,397
Is Tarek here?

817
00:51:03,402 --> 00:51:05,565
No. He's not here now.

818
00:51:05,637 --> 00:51:07,630
Uh, come in... please.

819
00:51:10,475 --> 00:51:11,637
Please.

820
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,039
Thank you.

821

Oh, my name is Walter. Walter Vale.

I'm... I'm Mouna Khalil.

00:51:27,161 --> 00:51:29,188
I'm sorry to show up unannounced.

824
00:51:30,363 --> 00:51:32,060
My son hasn't called me for five days.

825
00:51:32,132 --> 00:51:34,660
I keep trying his cell phone,
but he doesn't answer.

Would you like to sit down?

Is my son all right?

00:52:00,228 --> 00:52:01,218
Yes.

831
00:52:02,698 --> 00:52:04,030
He's been arrested.

832
00:52:06,201 --> 00:52:08,434
He's being held in a detention center.

833
00:52:09,538 --> 00:52:10,471
Where?

834
00:52:10,539 --> 00:52:11,632
In Queens.

835
00:52:11,707 --> 00:52:14,042
Uh, they're tying to deport him.

836
00:52:18,547 --> 00:52:19,641
How did this happen?

837
00:52:19,716 --> 00:52:22,654
He was stopped in a subway station.

838
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:25,691
Uh... he didn't... didn't
do anything wrong.

839
00:52:28,725 --> 00:52:30,718
I'd like to go there, to Queens.

00:52:32,396 --> 00:52:33,386
Okay.

841
00:52:34,731 --> 00:52:37,168
But, Mrs. Khalil, um, the lawyer m...

842
00:52:38,736 --> 00:52:41,104
Uh, I just don't
think it's possible for you...

843
00:52:41,172 --> 00:52:44,509
Mr. Vale, I know I cannot visit Tarek.

844
00:52:44,576 --> 00:52:47,571
I just want to see the place
where they're holding him.

845
00:52:49,414 --> 00:52:50,404
Okay.

846
00:52:51,582 --> 00:52:52,675
I can take you there.

847
00:52:52,751 --> 00:52:54,219
Thank you.

848
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:57,753
Could we go now?

849
00:52:59,625 --> 00:53:02,654
## [Oriental]

850
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:20,080
So have you been
to New York before, Mrs. Khalil?

851
00:53:20,146 --> 00:53:24,280
No. Tarek wanted to come to New York
to play music.

852
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:26,479
I did not want him to, but...

853
00:53:27,487 --> 00:53:29,081
Do you have
any children, Mr. Vale?

854
00:53:29,156 --> 00:53:31,319
A son. He lives in London.

855
00:53:31,391 --> 00:53:33,419
And your wife?

856
00:53:33,494 --> 00:53:35,396
My wife passed away.

857
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:36,452
I'm sorry.

858
00:53:43,438 --> 00:53:44,428
That's it.

859
00:53:46,141 --> 00:53:48,475
- This is where the prison is?
- Mm-hmm.

860
00:53:48,543 --> 00:53:50,570
It doesn't look like a prison.

861
00:53:50,645 --> 00:53:52,136
I think that's the point.

862
00:53:54,482 --> 00:53:56,247
How many people are in there?

863
00:53:56,318 --> 00:53:58,185
Tarek said about 300.

864
00:53:59,821 --> 00:54:01,256
There's, uh...

865
00:54:01,323 --> 00:54:02,815
There's a coffee shop on that corner.

866
00:54:03,092 --> 00:54:04,823
- It's not very nice.
- I'll wait there.

867
00:54:41,699 --> 00:54:43,794
Walter. I thought you were leaving.

868
00:54:43,868 --> 00:54:44,858
I was.

869
00:54:47,206 --> 00:54:48,606
Tarek, your mother is here.

870
00:54:48,673 --> 00:54:50,802
What? My mother? Where?

871
00:54:50,875 --> 00:54:52,708
She's waiting outside.

872
00:54:54,546 --> 00:54:55,479
When did she arrive?

873
00:54:55,546 --> 00:54:56,479
Today.

874
00:54:56,548 --> 00:54:58,644
Man. Why did she come?

875
00:54:58,717 --> 00:55:00,117
She can do nothing for me.

876
00:55:00,186 --> 00:55:02,657
Well, she said
she hadn't heard from you.

877
00:55:04,556 --> 00:55:06,822
Walter, listen to me.

878
00:55:06,892 --> 00:55:08,327
She... She can't stay here.

879
00:55:08,394 --> 00:55:10,387
She doesn't know
anyone in New York.

880
00:55:10,462 --> 00:55:13,127
I'm sorry, but you must get her
to go back to Michigan.

881
00:55:14,901 --> 00:55:17,498
Okay. Okay, I'll try.

882
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:18,833
Thank you, Walter.

883
00:55:18,905 --> 00:55:20,499
[sigh]

884
00:55:20,573 --> 00:55:21,905
I have a note from her.

885
00:55:39,428 --> 00:55:40,589
Need anything else?

886
00:55:41,929 --> 00:55:43,262
No, thank you.

887
00:56:27,978 --> 00:56:28,911
Hello, sir.

888
00:56:28,979 --> 00:56:29,969
Hi.

889
00:56:32,583 --> 00:56:33,573
How is he?

890
00:56:33,651 --> 00:56:35,245
Oh, he's good. He's good.

891
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,415
Um... but...

892
00:56:37,489 --> 00:56:39,983
he's very concerned
about you being here.

893
00:56:41,993 --> 00:56:43,587
I will not leave.

894
00:56:44,629 --> 00:56:45,927
[sigh]

895
00:56:45,997 --> 00:56:48,298
Mrs. Khalil, I don't... I don't think

896
00:56:48,366 --> 00:56:49,925
your being in New York will do any good

897
00:56:50,001 --> 00:56:51,903
because we have a very good lawyer
working on Tarek's...

898
00:56:51,971 --> 00:56:53,269
Mr. Vale.

899
00:56:53,339 --> 00:56:55,309
I will not go back to Michigan

900
00:56:55,374 --> 00:56:58,278
knowing that my son is in that building.

901
00:57:00,012 --> 00:57:02,005
Even if I can't see him...

902
00:57:03,015 --> 00:57:04,507
I will stay here.

903
00:57:10,357 --> 00:57:11,416
Shall we go?

904
00:57:15,729 --> 00:57:17,254
Uh madame?

905
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:24,360
Bye.

906
00:57:29,509 --> 00:57:30,499
[door closes]

907
00:57:32,881 --> 00:57:33,974
Mr. Vale?

908
00:57:35,716 --> 00:57:36,911
I'm leaving now.

909
00:57:36,984 --> 00:57:38,977
Thank you for your help.

910
00:57:39,053 --> 00:57:40,352
Where are you going?

911
00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:42,688
I'll find a hotel.

912
00:57:42,757 --> 00:57:45,490
You can stay here.
You can use Tarek's room.

913
00:57:46,895 --> 00:57:49,731
Thank you for your offer,
but I cannot accept it.

914
00:57:49,798 --> 00:57:51,323
I don't want to impose on you.

915
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,994
You're not imposing.

916
00:57:53,068 --> 00:57:55,562
Please. I would like you to stay.

917
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:57,563
Thank you.

918
00:57:58,574 --> 00:57:59,735
But I will manage.

919
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:05,849
Good-bye.

920
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:07,042
Good-bye.

Please.

926
00:58:30,442 --> 00:58:32,378
I was with Tarek
when he was arrested.

927
00:58:32,444 --> 00:58:35,382
He was in the subway
in the first place because of me.

928
00:58:35,447 --> 00:58:36,437
So...

929
00:58:37,449 --> 00:58:38,678
please.

No, thank you.

00:59:08,982 --> 00:59:11,078
Well... good night.

00:59:11,151 --> 00:59:12,141
Good night.

Bye.

Oh. Good morning.

946
01:00:12,149 --> 01:00:13,082
Morning.

947
01:00:13,149 --> 01:00:14,208
Mmhh...

948
01:00:19,223 --> 01:00:20,657
Tarek says hello.

949
01:00:21,726 --> 01:00:23,161
How is he?

950
01:00:23,227 --> 01:00:24,719
I can't really tell.

951
01:00:28,232 --> 01:00:30,168
He wants me to leave.

952
01:00:33,572 --> 01:00:37,012
Well... you're welcome to stay here
as long as you need to.

953
01:00:37,075 --> 01:00:38,008
Thank you.

954
01:00:38,076 --> 01:00:39,772
That's very generous of you.

955
01:00:39,846 --> 01:00:42,682
Well... thank you for the paper.

956
01:00:42,748 --> 01:00:43,773
You're welcome.

957
01:01:02,268 --> 01:01:05,206
Do you spend a lot of time in the city?

958
01:01:05,271 --> 01:01:08,038
No, no. Not really.

959
01:01:08,107 --> 01:01:11,205
I'm just here
presenting a paper at a conference.

960
01:01:11,278 --> 01:01:13,043
Well...

961
01:01:13,113 --> 01:01:14,046
You wrote it?

962
01:01:14,114 --> 01:01:15,104
Mm-hmm.

963
01:01:16,283 --> 01:01:17,615
Congratulations.

964
01:01:22,122 --> 01:01:24,058
I co-authored it, really.

965
01:01:30,932 --> 01:01:32,298
And what happened after the hearing?

966
01:01:33,535 --> 01:01:35,631
We appealed. It took two years.

967
01:01:35,704 --> 01:01:37,002
And your appeal was denied?

968
01:01:37,072 --> 01:01:38,564
Yes.

969
01:01:38,641 --> 01:01:40,907
And did they send you
your bag-and-baggage letter?

970
01:01:40,976 --> 01:01:42,707
- No.
- What's that?

971
01:01:42,777 --> 01:01:45,749
Basically, it tells you
where to show up and be deported.

972
01:01:45,814 --> 01:01:46,804
But you didn't receive it?

973
01:01:47,984 --> 01:01:50,079
No. I would remember this.

974
01:01:50,152 --> 01:01:51,586
Did you move?

975
01:01:51,654 --> 01:01:53,180
Eventually, we had to.

976
01:01:53,255 --> 01:01:55,248
But we had our mail advanced.

977
01:01:55,324 --> 01:01:58,262
Is it possible that it
just never got there?

978
01:01:58,328 --> 01:01:59,762
Yeah, it's happened before.

979
01:01:59,829 --> 01:02:02,266
And pre-9/11, it wasn't much of a priority
trackin' people down,

980
01:02:02,332 --> 01:02:05,827
but if you got it and you just ignored it,
then there's nothing I can do.

981
01:02:09,006 --> 01:02:10,942
So... you can help him.

982
01:02:11,007 --> 01:02:12,772
I'm gonna try.

983
01:02:12,844 --> 01:02:14,575
But you should know it's still a long shot.

984
01:02:14,645 --> 01:02:16,045
The government's approach
has changed radically.

985
01:02:16,113 --> 01:02:17,275
It's very black and white now.

986
01:02:17,348 --> 01:02:18,873
Either you belong, or you don't.

987
01:02:18,950 --> 01:02:21,786
Tarek's lucky.
Most of them don't even have lawyers.

988
01:02:21,852 --> 01:02:23,082
Lucky.

989
01:02:23,154 --> 01:02:24,713
Relatively speaking.

990
01:02:24,790 --> 01:02:26,224
We just have to move quickly

991
01:02:26,291 --> 01:02:28,284
to get an emergency stay,
and then we'll stick with a motion

992
01:02:28,359 --> 01:02:30,090
- to reopen, pending his green card application.

Can you explain
what that means, please?

997
01:02:36,834 --> 01:02:38,633
Actually, I don't have
the time right now.

998
01:02:38,704 --> 01:02:41,005
I'm sorry.
I have to be in court very shortly.

999
01:02:41,073 --> 01:02:42,302
How long will he be in detention?

1000
01:02:42,374 --> 01:02:46,144
I can't predict that. I am sorry,
but I am gonna have to wrap this up.

01:02:46,211 --> 01:02:49,378
Do you have any children, Mr. Shah?

1002
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:53,317
Yeah. Two kids.

1003
01:02:53,386 --> 01:02:55,014
And for what it's worth,
my uncle was deported

1004
01:02:55,088 --> 01:02:57,320
after raising a family here for 23 years.

1005

If I can get your son out... I will.

01:03:02,630 --> 01:03:03,620
Thank you.

1007
01:03:08,369 --> 01:03:09,359
Where are you from?

1008
01:03:10,404 --> 01:03:11,394
Queens.

1009
01:03:14,075 --> 01:03:15,338
[Mouna]
Which one is she?

1010
01:03:15,409 --> 01:03:16,342
[Walter]
The one closest to us.

1011
01:03:16,410 --> 01:03:18,312
That black woman?

1012
01:03:18,379 --> 01:03:19,312
Mm-hmm.

1013
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:20,313
That is Zainab?

1014
01:03:20,381 --> 01:03:21,371
Mm-hmm.

1015
01:03:23,752 --> 01:03:25,084
She's very black.

1016
01:03:26,087 --> 01:03:27,077
Mm-hmm.

1017
01:03:35,263 --> 01:03:36,390
Zainab.

1018
01:03:37,767 --> 01:03:39,258
Oh. Hi, Walter.

1019
01:03:39,334 --> 01:03:41,703
Uh, Zainab, this is Mouna Khalil...

1020
01:03:41,771 --> 01:03:43,365
Tarek's mother.

1021
01:03:43,439 --> 01:03:44,702
- Oh...
- Hello, Zainab.

1022
01:03:44,774 --> 01:03:46,037
Oh, I...

1023
01:03:46,109 --> 01:03:48,238
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Mrs. Khalil.

1024
01:03:48,311 --> 01:03:49,301
You, too.

1025
01:03:50,346 --> 01:03:52,783
Uh... I'm s... I'm sorry.

1026
01:03:52,849 --> 01:03:54,374
I... I didn't know
you were coming.

1027
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:56,443
Neither did I.

1028
01:04:00,457 --> 01:04:02,723
Your jewelry is very nice.

1029
01:04:02,793 --> 01:04:04,057
Oh.
[chuckles]

1030
01:04:04,127 --> 01:04:05,356
Oh, thank you.

1031
01:04:06,797 --> 01:04:08,391
[chuckles]

1032
01:04:08,465 --> 01:04:11,028
Do you think we can go out
for a cup of tea sometime?

1033
01:04:11,101 --> 01:04:13,071
Oh... yeah.

1034
01:04:13,136 --> 01:04:14,399
We could go right now.

1035
01:04:14,472 --> 01:04:17,410
I... I am...
I'm just watching Zev's table,

1036
01:04:17,475 --> 01:04:19,707
but I... um...

1037
01:04:19,777 --> 01:04:23,478
I just need to... find someone to...

1038
01:04:30,321 --> 01:04:31,414
Hey.

1039
01:04:31,490 --> 01:04:32,480
Hi.

1040
01:04:36,495 --> 01:04:38,020
[Woman]
Is it a necklace?

1041
01:04:38,097 --> 01:04:39,224
[Man]
I think so.

1042
01:04:41,001 --> 01:04:42,492
[Woman]
I like that one in the front.

1043
01:04:44,170 --> 01:04:45,160
Um...

1044
01:04:46,305 --> 01:04:47,500
It's all handmade.

1045
01:04:49,175 --> 01:04:50,200
Ooh.

1046
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:54,283
I've lived here for two years,

1047
01:04:54,347 --> 01:04:56,977
and I was in France
for a year before that.

1048
01:04:58,184 --> 01:04:59,277
Do you miss home?

1049
01:04:59,352 --> 01:05:01,789
Yes, sometimes.

1050
01:05:03,056 --> 01:05:04,524
But I don't want to live there.

1051
01:05:06,359 --> 01:05:07,521
Do you miss Syria?

1052
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:11,231
Sometimes, too.

1053
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:14,803
I miss Damascus...

1054
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:15,894
the smell.

1055
01:05:18,206 --> 01:05:20,039
But this is my home now.

1056
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:23,543
When did you meet Walter?

1057
01:05:23,812 --> 01:05:25,975
Walter? Uh...

1058
01:05:26,048 --> 01:05:28,451
about ten days ago.

1059
01:05:28,517 --> 01:05:30,851
Ten days? That's all?

1060
01:05:30,918 --> 01:05:32,319
Mm-hmm.

1061
01:05:33,555 --> 01:05:35,320
How did you meet him?

1062
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:36,380
Uh...

1063
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:39,290
through Tarek's friend.

1064
01:05:39,361 --> 01:05:41,832
Ivan. That's how we
ended up living there.

1065
01:05:41,898 --> 01:05:43,959
You live there, too?

1066
01:05:45,101 --> 01:05:46,570
Just for a little while.

1067
01:05:47,570 --> 01:05:48,560
Oh.

1068
01:05:56,079 --> 01:05:58,516
So... have you spoken to Tarek?

1069
01:05:58,582 --> 01:06:00,346
Yes.

1070
01:06:00,417 --> 01:06:02,010
He called me this morning.

1071
01:06:02,085 --> 01:06:03,816
He sounded in a good spirit.

1072
01:06:06,090 --> 01:06:08,185
I was so afraid this was going to happen.

1073
01:06:09,928 --> 01:06:12,160
Tarek used to tease me
that I worry too much.

1074
01:06:12,229 --> 01:06:13,219
But now...

1075
01:06:15,533 --> 01:06:17,469
I just don't know what to do.

1076
01:06:19,271 --> 01:06:20,933
I miss him so much.

1077
01:06:23,275 --> 01:06:24,300
I'm sorry.

1078
01:06:29,614 --> 01:06:30,605
Zainab.

1079
01:06:32,117 --> 01:06:33,984
I'd like you to do something for me.

1080
01:06:34,053 --> 01:06:37,891
I'd like you to show me
something you and Tarek like to do,

1081
01:06:37,957 --> 01:06:39,392
somewhere you like to go.

1082
01:06:40,626 --> 01:06:42,357
Like what?

1083
01:06:43,396 --> 01:06:45,059
Whatever you like.

1084
01:06:45,131 --> 01:06:47,226
Okay.

1085
01:06:47,299 --> 01:06:48,632
[chuckling]
Okay.

1086
01:07:04,652 --> 01:07:06,382
So what is in Staten Island?

1087
01:07:07,387 --> 01:07:08,583
I don't know.

1088
01:07:08,656 --> 01:07:11,058
We would just go there
and then come back.

1089
01:07:11,125 --> 01:07:12,150
We never got off.

1090
01:07:12,227 --> 01:07:13,217
Why?

1091
01:07:14,662 --> 01:07:15,595
It was free.

1092
01:07:15,663 --> 01:07:17,896
We felt like we were going somewhere.

1093
01:07:19,333 --> 01:07:22,932
Oh. That's where the Twin Towers were.

1094
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:25,909
I never saw them, but... Tarek did.

1095
01:07:26,942 --> 01:07:28,103
Oh. And...

1096
01:07:28,177 --> 01:07:29,646
there's the Statue.

1097
01:07:29,912 --> 01:07:31,939
And behind that is Ellis Island.

1098
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:36,613
Sometimes Tarek would point at the Statue
and jump up and down

1099
01:07:36,685 --> 01:07:39,418
like we're arriving
in New York for the first time.

1100
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:43,092
It was very funny.
[laughs]

1101
01:07:45,695 --> 01:07:47,631
Can you go up in the Statue?

1102
01:07:47,697 --> 01:07:49,291
Oh, yeah.

1103
01:07:49,366 --> 01:07:50,356
I think so.

1104
01:07:51,534 --> 01:07:52,593
You haven't been there?

1105
01:07:52,669 --> 01:07:53,602
No.

1106
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:54,603
Never?

1107
01:07:54,671 --> 01:07:55,639
Nope.

1108
01:07:55,706 --> 01:07:57,334
- Oh.
- [cell phone rings]

1109
01:07:58,341 --> 01:07:59,640
- Excuse me.
- [ring]

1110
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:00,700
Hello?

1111
01:08:01,712 --> 01:08:02,702
Hey, Charles.

1112
01:08:04,048 --> 01:08:05,107
What's that?

1113
01:08:05,183 --> 01:08:08,383
Um, yeah. I'm still in New York.

1114
01:08:10,055 --> 01:08:12,355
I'm sorry, Charles.
I couldn't make it back yesterday.

1115
01:08:13,424 --> 01:08:16,055
I said I couldn't make it back!

1116
01:08:16,127 --> 01:08:17,528
Well, I'm on a boat.

1117
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:19,623
A boat!

1118
01:08:19,698 --> 01:08:22,192
Listen, Charles, I'll explain it to you
when I see you.

1119
01:08:22,268 --> 01:08:23,998
But I have to go now,
so I'll call you back.

1120
01:08:24,069 --> 01:08:25,060
Bye.

1121
01:08:36,749 --> 01:08:38,115
[Tarek]
You went on the ferry?

1122
01:08:38,183 --> 01:08:39,151
Yes.

1123
01:08:39,218 --> 01:08:40,311
[chuckling]
No.

1124
01:08:40,387 --> 01:08:41,980
- My mother, too?
- She liked it.

1125
01:08:44,291 --> 01:08:47,695
You know that they don't even have
an outside space here.

1126
01:08:47,761 --> 01:08:50,061
They just have a room
with its roof cut out.

1127
01:08:50,130 --> 01:08:51,359
Really?

1128
01:08:51,430 --> 01:08:53,765
Some crazy stuff, man.

1129
01:08:55,602 --> 01:08:57,036
And they seemed to get along...

1130
01:08:57,104 --> 01:08:58,037
Zainab and my mother?

1131
01:08:58,105 --> 01:09:01,101
Yes. I think your mother
likes her very much.

1132
01:09:04,112 --> 01:09:05,706
My mother's not going home, is she?

1133
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:07,773
I don't think so.

1134
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:11,417
I know she's thinking about my father.

1135
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:13,610
Why?

1136
01:09:16,125 --> 01:09:17,718
He spent seven years in jail in Syria

1137
01:09:17,792 --> 01:09:19,785
because of something
he wrote in the newspaper.

1138
01:09:21,130 --> 01:09:24,592
By the time
they released him, he was very sick.

1139
01:09:26,302 --> 01:09:28,569
[Tarek]
He died two months later.

1140
01:09:28,637 --> 01:09:30,128
That's why we moved here.

1141
01:09:34,310 --> 01:09:35,744
Would you like a glass of wine?

1142
01:09:35,811 --> 01:09:37,474
No, thank you.

1143
01:09:44,154 --> 01:09:45,817
[wine pouring]

1144
01:09:48,658 --> 01:09:51,060
Mouna. Um...

1145
01:09:51,129 --> 01:09:55,763
I need to go back to Connecticut
tomorrow, for work. I told Tarek.

1146
01:09:55,833 --> 01:09:57,426
How long will you be gone?

1147
01:09:57,501 --> 01:09:59,562
Um, I don't know yet. I...

1148
01:10:00,838 --> 01:10:03,503
I'll try to get back
and visit him as soon as I can.

1149
01:10:05,509 --> 01:10:08,606
Walter, you don't have
to keep visiting him.

1150
01:10:08,679 --> 01:10:09,840
I'm sure you're busy.

1151
01:10:13,518 --> 01:10:14,851
I'll see what I can do.

1152
01:10:21,526 --> 01:10:22,789
Dinner will be ready soon.

1153
01:10:22,861 --> 01:10:24,558
Oh. Okay.

1154
01:10:37,877 --> 01:10:40,371
Walter. Do you go to Broadway?

1155
01:10:41,482 --> 01:10:42,472
No, not really.

1156
01:10:44,218 --> 01:10:45,413
Tarek sent me the CD

1157
01:10:49,190 --> 01:10:50,887
I think I know every word.

1158
01:10:57,898 --> 01:10:59,629
Tarek is teaching me the drum.

1159
01:11:00,634 --> 01:11:02,501
Really? How is that going?

1160
01:11:03,504 --> 01:11:04,837
Well, I... I sound a lot better

1161
01:11:04,906 --> 01:11:06,306
when he's playing with me.

1162
01:11:12,247 --> 01:11:13,546
How's your teaching?

1163
01:11:14,583 --> 01:11:15,516
My teaching?

1164
01:11:15,583 --> 01:11:16,516
Yes.

1165
01:11:16,584 --> 01:11:17,574
It's fine.

1166
01:11:18,586 --> 01:11:20,249
How many classes do you have?

1167
01:11:21,589 --> 01:11:24,584
Well, I have a lighter schedule
so I can focus on my book.

1168
01:11:25,593 --> 01:11:26,687
Your book?

1169
01:11:26,762 --> 01:11:27,923
What is it about?

1170

Mouna. Um...

01:22:35,469 --> 01:22:38,566
I'm taking a leave of absence...
uh, for the rest of the semester.

01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:39,572
Ahem.

Really? Why?

1345
01:22:41,609 --> 01:22:45,071
Well, I thought I might
spend some more time in New York.

1346
01:22:47,115 --> 01:22:50,384
Walter, you don't
have to do this. You're busy.

No, I want to.

But you have to be in Connecticut.

1349

No, it's fine. Really.

This is not your problem, Walter.

1352
01:23:03,298 --> 01:23:05,291
It's okay that you're busy.

I'm not busy.

Not at all.

1355

The truth is I haven't done any real work
in a very long time.

1356
01:23:17,214 --> 01:23:20,015
But you just
presented your paper at the conference.

1357
01:23:20,084 --> 01:23:22,578
No. No. No, I didn't even write it.

01:23:22,653 --> 01:23:23,678
I just read it.

the same course for 20 years,

I was taking you tonight, and I did.
