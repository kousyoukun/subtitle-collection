1
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:20,243
- Good morning.
- Good morning, madame.

2
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,077
- Good morning.
- Hello.

3
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:30,955
New delivery. I'm sure you've
got some excellent books there.

4
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:06,915
Got you at last!

5
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:11,522
Not the first time you've stolen
from me, is it, my little thief?!

6
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:14,318
- Quick, empty your pockets.
- You're hurting me!

7
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,292
Empty your pockets,
or I'll call the Station Inspector.

8
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,124
Do as I say!

9
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,703
What are you doing with all these?

10
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,371
- And the other one.
- There's nothing in it.

11
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:40,209
Where's the Station Inspector?!

12
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,231
Ghosts.

13
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,667
Did you draw these pictures?

14
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:42,346
Did you draw these pictures?

15
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,077
Where did you steal this?

16
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,584
- I didn't steal it.
- You're a thief and a liar.

17
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,188
- Get out of here.
- Give me my notebook!

18
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:53,551
It's no longer your notebook!

19
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:56,387
It is my notebook and I'll do with it
what I like! Maybe I'll just burn it!

20
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:59,189
- No!
- Then tell me who did the drawings!

21
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,535
Get out of here, you little thief!

22
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,563
Why are you still here?

23
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:14,439
- Go!
- Maximilian, do you hear an atrocity?

24
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,944
Calamity? Corruption? Go!

25
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,248
Excuse me, excuse me! Move aside!

26
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,058
Move aside! Gangway!

27
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,251
Move, move!

28
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,095
Stand aside!

29
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:05,459
What?!

30
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,455
A wolf!

31
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,137
Move, move!

32
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:30,651
As you were.

33
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,512
Move!

34
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,861
Stop that child! Apprehend!

35
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,693
Monsieur Frick!

36
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,628
Hey! Move aside!

37
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:51,736
Move!

38
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,138
Move!

39
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:54,404
Pardon me!

40
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:57,145
Sir, move!

41
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,860
Malediction!

42
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,965
No! Stop the train!

43
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,536
Hold the train!

44
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:26,240
Help! Help! Assistance!

45
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,042
Hold it, hold the train!

46
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,579
Move the bag! Move the bag!

47
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,747
No!

48
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:26,387
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.

49
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:29,226
I'm so sorry.

50
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,839
No, no, no.
That was very, very bad.

51
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:06,120
I know you're there.

52
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,063
What's your name, boy?

53
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,674
Hugo. Hugo Cabret.

54
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,310
Stay away from me, Hugo Cabret.

55
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,504
Or I'll drag you
to the Station Inspector's office.

56
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:28,375
He'll lock you up in his little cell,

57
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:32,954
and you'll never get out,
you'll never go to school,

58
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,285
you will never get married
and have children of your own

59
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:37,825
to take things
that don't belong to them.

60
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,260
Give me back my notebook.

61
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:46,031
I'm going home to burn your notebook.

62
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:58,607
- You can't burn my notebook.
- And who's to stop me?

63
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:32,405
You look so cold.

64
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:35,067
I'm very hot. He's really upset me.

65
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,271
- Who's really upset you?
- That child.

66
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,666
Who are you?

67
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:08,311
Your grandfather stole my notebook.

68
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,777
I've got to get it back
before he burns it.

69
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:13,314
Papa Georges isn't my grandfather.

70
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,509
And he isn't a thief. You're the thief.

71
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:17,244
You're nothing but a...

72
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:21,115
a reprobate.

73
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:26,194
- You'll have to go.
- Not without my notebook.

74
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:30,789
Why do you need it so badly?

75
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,632
I can't tell you.

76
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,869
Is it a secret?

77
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:41,368
- Yes.
- Oh, good, I love secrets.

78
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:44,207
- Tell me this instant.
- No.

79
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,646
Well, if you won't tell me,
then you'll have to leave.

80
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:48,807
Not without my notebook!

81
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,344
I'll get in trouble.

82
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:54,222
Just go home.

83
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:03,831
All right.

84
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,360
I'll make sure he doesn't
burn your notebook.

85
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:09,968
Now go.

86
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:00,581
What is it?

87
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,851
It's called an automaton.

88
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:05,723
An aut... An automaton?

89
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:09,093
I found him abandoned
in the attic at the museum.

90
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,369
What does he do?

91
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:18,372
He's a windup figure, like a music box.

92
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:23,980
This is the most complicated one
I've ever seen... by far.

93
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,084
You see, this one...

94
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,113
this one can write.

95
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:36,659
It must've been made in London.

96
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:38,385
Where Mother was from.

97
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:42,923
She was from Coventry, but she...
moved to London.

98
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:46,262
Magicians used machines like this
when I was a boy.

99
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,701
Some walked, some danced, some sang.

100
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:53,741
But the secret was always
in the clockwork.

101
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,604
Look at that.

102
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:01,584
Can we fix him?

103
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,412
I don't know, Hugo.

104
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:06,783
He's badly rusted.

105
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:09,619
And finding parts to fit
will be very hard.

106
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:15,490
Of course we can fix him.

107
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,131
We're clockmakers, aren't we?

108
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,327
But only after I've finished
my work at the shop

109
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:24,497
and at the museum, hmm?
You understand.

110
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:32,715
We'll put this back in.
Just steady it...

111
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,948
Perfect

112
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:52,294
You see this? Another complication.

113
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,327
Another mystery.

114
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,405
That makes you happy.

115
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:02,036
A keyhole in the shape of a heart.

116
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,078
Unfortunately, we don't have the key.

117
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:15,216
I fixed the gears, and...

118
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,690
Uncle Claude.

119
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,630
There was a fire.

120
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,232
Your father's dead.

121
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:43,145
Pack your things, quickly.
You're coming with me.

122
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:49,076
Quick!

123
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:02,122
You'll be my apprentice,
and you'll live with me at the station.

124
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:04,665
And I'll teach you how
to take care of them clocks.

125
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:14,805
These apartments were built for them
that run the station years ago.

126
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,343
But every body's forgotten they're here.

127
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:26,784
Your bed is in the corner, over there.

128
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:32,295
Now, get some sleep.
We start work at 5:00.

129
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:40,659
- What about school?
- You've finished with school!

130
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:45,908
There'll be no time for that
when you're in them walls.

131
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:54,816
Hugo, without me,
you'd be in the orphanage.

132
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:05,154
Time...

133
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:09,865
My time is... 60 seconds in a minute.

134
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:13,595
Sixty minutes in an hour.

135
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,436
Time is everything.

136
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:19,371
Everything.

137
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:24,947
<i>Time, time, time...</i>

138
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,886
OK.

139
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:52,307
Oh, hello.

140
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:55,635
I just thought...

141
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:58,810
a rather nice joke.

142
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:05,047
Stop that! No, Schatzi! Stop it!

143
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:07,248
No, no, no!

144
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:11,622
Come back!

145
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,992
Stand back!
He's just a small little dog.

146
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:19,058
Please be careful!
You've stepped on him!

147
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:22,796
Don't hurt him!

148
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:19,021
- Good morning!
- Morning, sweetheart.

149
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,055
Hello, how are you?

150
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:26,001
Good morning, sir.
Can I help you with anything?

151
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:27,534
I'll take these.

152
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,904
I thought I might see you today.

153
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:17,244
I need my notebook.

154
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,615
Why do you need it so badly?

155
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,528
To help me...

156
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:28,260
to fix something.

157
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:10,328
Go away.

158
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,642
Please just go away.

159
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:24,314
Wait! Hey!

160
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:28,219
- Sorry, I...
- I saw.

161
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:32,022
- Are you crying?
- No.

162
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:34,163
Hold still.

163
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,358
Look, there's nothing wrong with crying.

164
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:42,335
Sydney Carton cries.
And Heathcliff, too.

165
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:46,135
- In books, they're crying all the time.
- I can do it.

166
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:49,972
I need to talk to you.
It's terribly important, but...

167
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:52,672
But not here. We're too...

168
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:56,953
exposed.

169
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:01,219
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

170
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:03,985
Only to the most
wonderful place on earth

171
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:06,151
It's Neverland and Oz and...

172
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:09,059
Treasure Island all wrapped into one.

173
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,961
Good morning, Monsieur Labisse.

174
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:12,965
Isabelle.

175
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:16,333
May I present to you
Monsieur Hugo Cabret,

176
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:18,997
a very old and dear companion.

177
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:26,073
Monsieur Cabret.

178
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:29,709
Hello.

179
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,383
Well, thank you for this.

180
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:38,358
I think I'm halfway in love with
David Copperfield. Photography?

181
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:43,431
- Back corner, left, top shelf.
- Thank you.

182
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:53,542
Listen, what's so important?

183
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:56,110
Papa Georges still has your notebook.

184
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:58,713
He didn't burn it.
That was all a trick.

185
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,942
- Why?
- I don't know.

186
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:05,213
All I know is the notebook
made him very upset.

187
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:08,516
And he and Mama Jeanne stayed up
very late talking about it.

188
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:13,696
Well, you see, I think he was crying.

189
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,629
Why are you helping me?

190
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:24,068
Because this might be an adventure.

191
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:26,573
And I've never had one before...

192
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,607
outside of books, at least.

193
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:34,273
And I think we should be very...

194
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:38,888
clandestine.

195
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,484
OK.

196
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:47,653
By the way, my name's Isabelle.
Do you want a book?

197
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:51,961
Monsieur Labisse lets me borrow them,
and I'm sure I could get one for you.

198
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,568
No.

199
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,830
Don't you like books?

200
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,570
No... No, I do.

201
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:04,603
My father and I used to read
Jules Verne together.

202
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:15,421
Well, come on.

203
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:18,084
How do I get my notebook back?

204
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:20,957
Well, I think you
should stand up to him.

205
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:23,292
And don't tell him we talked.

206
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:25,024
I'll help you if I can.

207
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:27,632
Be steadfast.

208
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:37,340
Go away.

209
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,561
Fix it.

210
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,338
I said, fix it.

211
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:09,036
I know you've been
stealing parts from the shop.

212
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,646
You might as well use those
you haven't stolen yet.

213
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,200
Give me my notebook.

214
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:16,572
You've got a bit of talent.

215
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:20,607
But you'll have to prove there's
more to you than being a thief.

216
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,912
- You can earn your notebook.
- How?

217
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:25,110
Come to the booth every day.

218
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:28,553
I'll decide how long you must
work for each item you stole.

219
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:31,717
And it will be up to me
to decide when...

220
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,829
you've earned
your notebook, if ever.

221
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:39,064
- I already have a job.
- "Thief" is not a job, boy.

222
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:43,467
I have a different job.
But I'll come when I can.

223
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:48,140
You begin tomorrow. Go away.

224
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:51,936
I'll begin now.

225
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:01,585
Not that one, the other one.

226
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,747
Is this your card?

227
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:39,739
Where is it?

228
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:25,491
Little man.

229
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,527
Where are your designated adults?
Answer me!

230
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:38,799
- Ain't got none.
- Do you have any parents?

231
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,040
- No!
- Excellent.

232
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,873
It's straight to the orphanage
with you, isn't it?

233
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,845
What were you doing
looking in that man's bottle?

234
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:49,484
Was that your...
Was that your bottle?!

235
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,313
Was that your paper bag?

236
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:53,716
Was that your paper bag?
It states clearly...

237
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:59,226
Yes, Gustave Dasté here.
Yes, Officer, another orphan.

238
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,727
Trespass and theft this time.

239
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,662
His hand was trespassing
inside a paper bag,

240
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:07,769
with the intent of
removing its contents.

241
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:13,236
The object of his plunder? A pastry.

242
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,041
Be quiet!

243
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:21,710
Keep... Stop your sniffling,
you little urchin,

244
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:24,011
with your filthy little mitts.

245
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,183
No, of course I wasn't talking to you.

246
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:30,451
I have only
the highest respect for you. Please.

247
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:34,261
No, that was not a comment
about your wife.

248
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,256
That's absurd.

249
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:41,870
I have not heard any of those rumors.
No, I was not aware of that.

250
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:44,529
Well, I'm sure she will return.

251
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:46,572
Come on, you little vermin.

252
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:48,267
So here's the little pastry thief, eh?

253
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,776
- This is the one.
- Who's a little strudel thief then?

254
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:53,242
Apologies about your wife.

255
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:55,247
What do you think
I should do about her?

256
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:57,545
- What? About what?
- Leaving me.

257
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:00,085
- Hey! Come on!
- Nice try.

258
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:02,956
Go on, get in there!

259
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,116
- Do you think it's mine?
- What?

260
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,422
I don't know what to do.
She's having a baby, you know.

261
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:10,065
- Sure it's yours?
- Who else's could it be?

262
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:13,225
Of course it's yours. When's the last
time you had relations with her?

263
00:38:14,258 --> 00:38:15,430
Any time in the last year?

264
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:18,802
- No, I don't think so.
- Very suspicious, then.

265
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,136
If you should see her, please...

266
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:22,804
You sure you want her back?

267
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,243
Oh, yes, yes.
I love her very much.

268
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:31,515
Ready? One, two, three!

269
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,546
Perfect

270
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:44,657
Robin Hood. I saw this movie.

271
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:48,167
With Douglas Fairbanks.
Did you see that?

272
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,670
I've never seen a movie.

273
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,138
- What?
- Isn't it appalling?

274
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:56,335
You've never seen a movie? Not ever?

275
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,173
Papa Georges won't let me.

276
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,681
- He's very strict about it.
- I love the movies.

277
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,319
My father always took me
for my birthday.

278
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,557
Hugo...

279
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:14,294
is your father dead?

280
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:17,663
I don't want to talk about it.

281
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:30,339
Isabelle...

282
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:36,819
do you want to have an adventure?

283
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,408
We could get into trouble.

284
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,786
That's how you know it's an adventure.

285
00:40:58,155 --> 00:41:01,227
How did you two rats get in here?!
Come on!

286
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:08,340
And I'd better not see
you in here again!

287
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:16,118
Why doesn't Papa Georges
let you go to the movies?

288
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:19,117
I don't know. He never said.

289
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,289
I bet my parents would've let me.

290
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:23,856
What happened to them?

291
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:29,491
They died... when I was a baby.

292
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:32,133
But Papa Georges and Mama Jeanne,
they're my godparents,

293
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:33,859
so they took me in.

294
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:38,097
They're very nice about most everything,
except the movies.

295
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:40,264
My father took me
to the movies all the time.

296
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:43,970
He told me about the first one
he ever saw.

297
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:47,172
He went into a dark room,
and on a white screen,

298
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:51,980
he saw a rocket fly
into the eye of the man in the moon.

299
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:53,815
- It went straight in.
- Really?

300
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:56,652
He said it was like seeing
his dreams in the middle of the day.

301
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:00,989
The movies were our special place...

302
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:05,223
where we could go
and watch something, and...

303
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:10,394
we didn't miss my mum so much.

304
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:14,670
You think about him a lot, don't you?

305
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:18,338
All the time.

306
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:25,149
Hugo... where do you live?

307
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,201
There.

308
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:47,373
My uncle taught me
how to run the clocks.

309
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:49,909
So I just keep on doing it.

310
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:54,113
Maybe he'll come back one day,
but I doubt it.

311
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:57,510
Aren't you afraid someone will find out?

312
00:42:57,675 --> 00:43:00,554
Not as long as the clocks keep
on running and no one sees me.

313
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:08,089
- Act natural.
- What?

314
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,926
Just keep on walking. Act natural.

315
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:13,090
How am I acting now?

316
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:29,441
You two, halt!

317
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:32,649
Come here.

318
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:39,986
- Good day, monsieur.
- Where are your parents?

319
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,758
I work with my Papa Georges
at the toy booth.

320
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:45,992
Surely you've seen me there before.

321
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:49,831
And this is my cousin
from the country, Hugo.

322
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:06,854
You'll have to forgive him.

323
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:12,518
He's quite... simple-minded.
Doltish, really.

324
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:14,526
Poor thing.

325
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:28,366
Seems Maximilian doesn't like
the cut of your jib, little man.

326
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:31,706
He is disturbed by your physiognomy.

327
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:35,146
He is upset by your visage.

328
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:39,011
Why would he not like your face?

329
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:46,522
Well, perhaps he smells my cat.

330
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:50,556
- Cat?
- Yes.

331
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:54,294
Christina Rossetti's her name,
after the poetess.

332
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,899
Would you like me to recite?

333
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:59,598
My heart is like a singing bird

334
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:02,243
Whose nest is in a water'd shoot

335
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:04,902
My heart is like an apple tree

336
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:07,174
Whose boughs are bent with thick-set...

337
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:09,647
All right, all right. I know the rest.

338
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:11,480
That's enough poetry for today.

339
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:17,354
I love poetry, particularly
that poem by Chris... tina.

340
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:18,584
- Rossetti.
- She's... yeah.

341
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:22,196
She's one of my favorites.
I know it's Rossetti.

342
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,490
I know it's Rossetti.

343
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:27,829
I love poetry, just...
not in the station.

344
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:32,838
We're here to either
get on trains or get off them.

345
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:36,443
Or work in different shops,
is that clear?

346
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,638
- Yes, sir.
- Watch your step.

347
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,077
Go on, go.

348
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,525
Doltish?

349
00:45:57,187 --> 00:46:00,100
Now, since I just saved your life,

350
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:03,204
how about letting me see
your covert lair?

351
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:08,609
- My what?
- Where you live, in the walls.

352
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:15,808
I have to go now. I have things to do.

353
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:17,418
Hold on!

354
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:22,122
You've seen my house.
Isn't it about time that I saw yours?

355
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:23,986
After all, I am your only friend.

356
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:25,650
You're not my only friend.

357
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:28,160
Being enigmatic really doesn't suit you.

358
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:30,992
- What are you up to?
- I've got to go.

359
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:33,795
I should never have left
the station to begin with.

360
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,583
Hugo!

361
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:19,773
- Where did you get this?
- None of your business.

362
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:22,941
- I need it.
- What for?

363
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:24,608
I just need it.

364
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:26,647
Not unless...

365
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:29,120
Not unless you tell me why.

366
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:36,220
Come.

367
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:49,501
This is marvelous.
I feel just like Jean Valjean.

368
00:47:59,843 --> 00:48:02,551
Oh, this is superlative.

369
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:12,061
What is that?

370
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,035
It's an automaton.

371
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:20,541
My father was fixing it...
before he died.

372
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:34,584
Why would my key fit
into your father's machine?

373
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,222
He looks sad.

374
00:48:43,787 --> 00:48:46,631
I think he's just waiting.

375
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:48,463
For what?

376
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,771
To work again.

377
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:57,612
To do what he's supposed to do.

378
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:01,915
What happens when you wind him up?

379
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:07,012
I don't know.

380
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,762
What's the matter?

381
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:31,775
I know it's silly...

382
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:40,182
but I think it's going
to be a message from my father.

383
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:25,183
What an idiot, to think I could fix it.

384
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:31,255
- Hugo...
- It's broken!

385
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:33,451
It'll always be broken!

386
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:40,567
Look...

387
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:47,737
Hugo, look, it doesn't
have to be like this.

388
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:49,672
- You can fix it.
- You don't...

389
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,710
You don't understand.

390
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,815
I thought...

391
00:52:56,706 --> 00:53:01,177
if I could fix it,
I wouldn't be so alone.

392
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,726
Hugo!

393
00:53:12,556 --> 00:53:17,562
Hugo, look! Look, it's not done.
It's not done!

394
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:29,975
It's not writing...

395
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:32,186
it's drawing.

396
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:13,060
That's the movie my father saw.

397
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:56,334
Georges Méliés?

398
00:54:57,994 --> 00:54:59,769
That's Papa Georges' name.

399
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:07,105
Why would your father's machine
sign Papa Georges' name?

400
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:10,615
I don't know.

401
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:26,196
Thank you.

402
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:31,596
It was a message from my father.

403
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:34,600
And now we have to figure it out.

404
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:48,046
Come on.

405
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:52,826
- Come on.
- Isabelle?

406
00:55:56,219 --> 00:55:59,462
Mama Jeanne, we...
We have to talk to you.

407
00:56:01,324 --> 00:56:02,860
This is Hugo Cabret.

408
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:06,903
Good evening, ma'am.

409
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:14,204
Very good manners... for a thief.

410
00:56:15,338 --> 00:56:16,976
I'm not a thief.

411
00:56:24,647 --> 00:56:26,024
What's going on, Isabelle?

412
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:29,391
Well, it's a terribly long story
filled with circumlocutions,

413
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:31,361
but do you remember
several weeks ago when...

414
00:56:31,521 --> 00:56:32,829
Wait!

415
00:56:55,945 --> 00:56:57,947
Mama?

416
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:05,562
Oh, children.

417
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:11,432
What have you done?
Where did you get this?

418
00:57:13,062 --> 00:57:14,666
You'll call me a liar.

419
00:57:14,864 --> 00:57:16,537
No, child.

420
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:21,306
A mechanical man drew it.

421
00:57:22,238 --> 00:57:23,717
Do you have him?

422
00:57:23,873 --> 00:57:26,376
My father found him in a museum.

423
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:29,785
Nobody wanted him.

424
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,118
We fixed it.

425
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:34,756
No, but it needed my...

426
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:38,627
my key.

427
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:45,302
- The key I gave you.
- No, no, Mama, he...

428
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:49,774
No. No, you take this away.
Can't dredge up the past now.

429
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:52,072
Whatever happens, you don't let
Papa Georges see it.

430
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:54,943
- Please tell us what's going on.
- Out! None of your business.

431
00:57:55,104 --> 00:57:56,344
You must both forget this.

432
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:59,680
My father and I,
we worked hard to fix this.

433
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:02,847
This is all I have left of him.

434
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:06,187
I need to know what this means.

435
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,322
Please.

436
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:14,765
There are things
you're too young to understand.

437
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:19,633
You should not yet
know such sadness.

438
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:25,974
- It's Papa Georges.
- He can't know you're here.

439
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:27,671
Quiet!

440
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:34,047
Now just keep quiet. I'll find a way
to get him out of the apartment.

441
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:37,185
Not a noise from either of you.

442
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:44,995
She looked at the armoire.

443
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:48,567
I already searched it when
I was looking for your notebook.

444
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:52,673
I'll look again. You stand guard.

445
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:55,001
Splendid.

446
00:59:05,308 --> 00:59:07,015
- Where's Fizzie?
- You just missed her.

447
00:59:07,176 --> 00:59:09,383
Not on the stairs? Didn't you
see her when you were going past?

448
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:12,493
- No.
- No? Well...

449
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,515
Look.

450
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:43,849
We have to investigate.

451
00:59:45,949 --> 00:59:48,054
Let me. I'm taller.

452
00:59:59,696 --> 01:00:02,074
- Knock on it.
- OK.

453
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:55,412
Back from the dead.

454
01:01:58,648 --> 01:02:00,992
Stop. Stop, Georges.

455
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:04,496
- Stop it! This is your work!
- My work?!

456
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:06,497
What am I?

457
01:02:06,656 --> 01:02:10,900
Nothing but a penniless merchant!
A broken windup toy.

458
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:16,510
I trusted you.

459
01:02:19,936 --> 01:02:22,348
This is how you thank me.

460
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:30,457
You're cruel.

461
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:35,119
Cruel.

462
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,257
I should get back.

463
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:11,492
OK.

464
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:27,239
Thank you...

465
01:03:28,671 --> 01:03:30,844
for the movie today. It...

466
01:03:32,675 --> 01:03:34,552
It was a gift.

467
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,476
Sorry, I...
