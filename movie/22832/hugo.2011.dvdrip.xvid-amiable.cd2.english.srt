1
00:00:04,119 --> 00:00:06,224
You know this volume?

2
00:00:08,123 --> 00:00:10,729
My father and I
used to read it together.

3
00:00:15,897 --> 00:00:20,243
It is intended for... my godson.

4
00:00:23,105 --> 00:00:27,576
But now I think it is intended...

5
00:00:28,377 --> 00:00:31,324
for you, Monsieur Cabret.

6
00:00:50,932 --> 00:00:52,411
Might I have another cup?

7
00:00:52,567 --> 00:00:54,604
Still brewing. Soon.

8
00:00:56,271 --> 00:00:58,945
Demitasse, like everything else,

9
00:00:59,107 --> 00:01:02,088
must happen at the opportune moment.

10
00:01:03,578 --> 00:01:07,185
If we only knew when that moment was.

11
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:10,990
Oh, Gustave, be intrepid.

12
00:01:11,153 --> 00:01:12,757
Say hello to her.

13
00:01:14,589 --> 00:01:17,331
Come on, give me your best smile.

14
00:01:24,266 --> 00:01:25,802
Your best smile.

15
00:01:30,772 --> 00:01:32,376
It's beautiful.

16
00:01:33,842 --> 00:01:35,014
Radiant!

17
00:01:37,546 --> 00:01:38,854
Thank you.

18
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,210
Mademoiselle Lisette.

19
00:02:07,376 --> 00:02:10,687
A very gracious good evening to you.

20
00:02:12,647 --> 00:02:15,992
- Monsieur Inspector.
- Yes.

21
00:02:19,254 --> 00:02:20,597
Yes.

22
00:02:21,757 --> 00:02:24,761
Those are lovely posies, those.

23
00:02:24,926 --> 00:02:26,872
Thank you.

24
00:02:27,863 --> 00:02:29,501
Yes, they're from Gourdon.

25
00:02:29,631 --> 00:02:33,101
They come in on the overnight train,
so they're very fresh.

26
00:02:33,268 --> 00:02:34,406
Gourdon.

27
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:37,379
Splendid country, that.

28
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:39,450
Robust.

29
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:48,959
The weather...
the cows and such, mooing.

30
00:02:49,117 --> 00:02:51,222
Perfectly formed udders

31
00:02:51,853 --> 00:02:53,093
Yeah.

32
00:02:53,922 --> 00:02:58,200
Are they... Are they smelly?

33
00:02:59,194 --> 00:03:00,696
Are they smelly flowers?

34
00:03:03,398 --> 00:03:06,470
Yes, a little. They're... Please.

35
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,467
You see, I was injured in the war,
and it will never heal.

36
00:03:31,626 --> 00:03:33,799
Good evening, mademoiselle.

37
00:03:36,364 --> 00:03:38,071
I lost my brother.

38
00:03:42,938 --> 00:03:44,076
Where?

39
00:03:45,474 --> 00:03:47,317
Verdun.

40
00:04:07,462 --> 00:04:09,499
Good evening, Monsieur Inspector.

41
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:15,681
Very good evening,
Mademoiselle Lisette.

42

<i>The Film Academy library.</i>

The Invention of Dreams...

49
00:05:06,087 --> 00:05:08,863
<i>by René Tabard...</i>

50
00:05:10,425 --> 00:05:14,931
The Story of the First Movies.

51
00:05:19,701 --> 00:05:23,945
"In 1895, one of the very
first films ever shown"

52
00:05:24,105 --> 00:05:26,449
<i>was called A Train Arrives
in the Station,</i>

53
00:05:26,608 --> 00:05:30,317
<i>"which had nothing more than
a train coming into the station."</i>

54
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,060
<i>"When the train came
speeding toward the screen,"</i>

55
00:05:38,219 --> 00:05:40,893
the audience screamed,
because they thought

56
00:05:41,056 --> 00:05:43,900
they were in danger of being run over.

57
00:05:45,961 --> 00:05:49,909
"No one had ever seen
anything like it before."

58
00:05:53,435 --> 00:05:56,973
"No one had ever seen
anything like it before."

59
00:06:03,745 --> 00:06:07,488
"What began as <i>a</i> sideshow novelty
soon grew into something more"

60
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:09,925
<i>when the first filmmakers discovered</i>

61
00:06:10,085 --> 00:06:13,623
<i>"they could use the new medium
to tell stories. "</i>

62
00:06:22,564 --> 00:06:24,475
Wow.

63
00:06:56,364 --> 00:07:00,278
"The filmmaker, Georges Mélies..."

64
00:07:01,136 --> 00:07:04,640
was one of the first
to realize that...

65
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,786
films had the power...

66
00:07:08,777 --> 00:07:10,984
"...to capture dreams."

67
00:07:12,814 --> 00:07:17,229
"The great pioneer
of early filmmaking died during..."

68
00:07:19,287 --> 00:07:21,858
"...the Great War."

69
00:07:22,023 --> 00:07:23,468
Died?

70
00:07:24,993 --> 00:07:27,701
- During the Great War?
- You're interested in Mélies?

71
00:07:31,066 --> 00:07:32,136
Yes.

72
00:07:35,403 --> 00:07:36,848
It's allowed.

73
00:07:38,173 --> 00:07:39,584
Is it?

74
00:07:53,688 --> 00:07:55,531
He's my godfather, you see.

75
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:59,570
And very much alive,
thank you very much.

76
00:08:02,397 --> 00:08:06,106
But that's not possible.

77
00:08:07,235 --> 00:08:09,044
I assure you, sir...

78
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:11,381
it's true.

79
00:08:12,774 --> 00:08:14,947
Why should I believe you?

80
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:19,290
Because...

81
00:08:20,882 --> 00:08:23,362
Because it's true.

82
00:08:25,453 --> 00:08:27,455
Méliés alive?

83
00:08:42,237 --> 00:08:43,147
Come with me.

84
00:08:49,944 --> 00:08:54,051
Your godfather is a passion of mine.

85
00:08:54,983 --> 00:08:57,327
He was a great filmmaker.

86
00:08:57,485 --> 00:08:59,897
Here he is at work in his studio.

87
00:09:01,055 --> 00:09:05,470
And this is a handbill
from his stage act.

88
00:09:07,295 --> 00:09:10,504
Here is the great crystal mystery clock

89
00:09:10,665 --> 00:09:13,612
made by his mentor, Robert-Houdin.

90
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:20,317
And this... is one of his
actual cameras.

91
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:29,419
- He was a magician?
- Yes. He began on the stage.

92
00:09:29,551 --> 00:09:32,361
How did he start making movies?

93
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,625
No one really knows.

94
00:09:36,925 --> 00:09:38,996
Look how happy he is.

95
00:09:40,461 --> 00:09:45,706
Professor Tabard, would you, perhaps...

96
00:09:46,968 --> 00:09:48,538
like to meet him?

97
00:09:50,205 --> 00:09:55,951
Oh... but you see, I have met him.

98
00:09:57,645 --> 00:10:02,185
My brother worked as a carpenter
building sets for Méliés.

99
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,559
<i>One day he took me to
visit the studio.</i>

100
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,032
<i>It was like...
something out of a dream.</i>

101
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:14,165
<i>The whole building
was made of glass.</i>

102
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:18,903
<i>In reality, this was to let in all
the sunlight necessary for filming,</i>

103
00:10:19,067 --> 00:10:21,843
<i>but to my eyes,
it was nothing short of...</i>

104
00:10:22,003 --> 00:10:24,916
<i>an enchanted castle.</i>

105
00:10:26,674 --> 00:10:29,746
<i>A palace made of glass.</i>

106
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:45,931
We need more light!

107
00:10:46,094 --> 00:10:48,938
- Get the louvers opened.
- Open the louver, please! More!

108
00:10:50,365 --> 00:10:53,676
Clear the set, please!
Everybody except actors.

109
00:10:53,801 --> 00:10:56,805
Actors only on the set, please.
Clear the set!

110
00:10:59,841 --> 00:11:00,945
Why we doing this again?

111
00:11:01,109 --> 00:11:02,952
There was a lobster
in front of a mermaid.

112
00:11:03,111 --> 00:11:04,954
OK, if that happens again,
shout "blocked."

113
00:11:05,113 --> 00:11:06,615
If it's clear, give me a "clear."

114
00:11:19,093 --> 00:11:22,939
If you've ever wondered
where your dreams come from...

115
00:11:24,232 --> 00:11:25,472
you look around.

116
00:11:29,404 --> 00:11:31,315
This is where they're made.

117
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:37,489
Ladies and gentlemen, the sun will set!

118
00:11:37,645 --> 00:11:39,886
Knights in position,
lobsters in position.

119
00:11:40,048 --> 00:11:42,221
Mermaids in position. Action!

120
00:11:52,927 --> 00:11:56,170
<i>In the end, he made over 500 movies.</i>

121
00:11:56,764 --> 00:12:00,007
<i>He was phenomenally
popular in his day.</i>

122
00:12:00,168 --> 00:12:04,514
But... why did he stop?

123
00:12:04,672 --> 00:12:08,279
Up until today, I believed
that he died in the war...

124
00:12:09,243 --> 00:12:10,984
like so many others.

125
00:12:13,314 --> 00:12:15,487
Could we watch some of his movies?

126
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,152
I wish you could.

127
00:12:17,318 --> 00:12:21,027
But time hasn't been kind to old movies.

128
00:12:26,828 --> 00:12:30,071
This is the only one
that we know of that survived.

129
00:12:31,132 --> 00:12:34,545
Out of hundreds, one.

130
00:12:36,971 --> 00:12:38,951
And still...

131
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,790
it is a masterpiece.

132
00:12:47,582 --> 00:12:50,290
We've got to get Tabard
to show Papa Georges the film.

133
00:12:50,451 --> 00:12:52,522
Then he'll see he's not forgotten.

134
00:12:54,222 --> 00:12:56,168
Shouldn't I tell Mama Jeanne?

135
00:12:57,825 --> 00:13:01,898
No. I think it should be
a surprise, like a magic trick.

136
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:08,806
We need to have some... panache.

137
00:13:10,405 --> 00:13:11,577
Panache.

138
00:13:13,207 --> 00:13:14,515
Well done!

139
00:13:30,491 --> 00:13:32,061
Monsieur Claude?

140
00:13:33,928 --> 00:13:36,033
Are you up there?

141
00:13:37,432 --> 00:13:39,105
Monsieur Claude, was that you?

142
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:42,612
Keep a grip onto your spanners,
you cack-handed oaf!

143
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:45,250
You can hold onto a bottle
well enough, can't you?

144
00:13:45,406 --> 00:13:47,386
Are you inebriated?

145
00:13:47,942 --> 00:13:52,254
Chateauxed, are we?
Shicker? Are you drunk?

146
00:13:53,014 --> 00:13:54,391
He's passed out.

147
00:13:54,549 --> 00:13:56,051
He's passed out, isn't he?

148
00:13:56,217 --> 00:13:58,925
You bloated buffoon!

149
00:14:00,121 --> 00:14:01,964
Could've hurt a child.

150
00:14:14,836 --> 00:14:16,713
What have we here?

151
00:14:16,838 --> 00:14:20,285
Jules Verne. Yes, indeed.

152
00:14:20,441 --> 00:14:22,717
- Not unknown in France.
- One of our finest.

153
00:14:22,877 --> 00:14:23,912
Very good plates.

154
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:27,025
Monsieur Labisse gave me
a book the other night.

155
00:14:27,181 --> 00:14:31,129
He's always doing that,
sending books to a good home.

156
00:14:31,285 --> 00:14:33,196
That's what he calls it.

157
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:36,766
He's got real...

158
00:14:39,127 --> 00:14:40,333
Purpose.

159
00:14:41,262 --> 00:14:42,798
What do you mean?

160
00:14:42,964 --> 00:14:46,241
Everything has a purpose,
even machines.

161
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,576
Clocks tell the time
and trains take you places.

162
00:14:50,705 --> 00:14:52,776
They do what they're meant to do.

163
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,476
Like Monsieur Labisse.

164
00:14:56,844 --> 00:15:00,223
Maybe that's why
broken machines make me so sad.

165
00:15:00,948 --> 00:15:03,326
They can't do what they're meant to do.

166
00:15:04,218 --> 00:15:06,323
Maybe it's the same with people.

167
00:15:06,487 --> 00:15:11,664
If you lose your purpose,
it's like you're broken.

168
00:15:13,227 --> 00:15:15,036
Like Papa Georges.

169
00:15:16,464 --> 00:15:18,171
Maybe we can fix him.

170
00:15:19,534 --> 00:15:23,710
Is that your purpose, fixing things?

171
00:15:24,705 --> 00:15:26,378
I don't know.

172
00:15:27,308 --> 00:15:29,185
It's what my father did.

173
00:15:30,811 --> 00:15:33,189
I wonder what my purpose is.

174
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,994
I don't know.

175
00:15:39,554 --> 00:15:42,000
Maybe if I had known my parents...

176
00:15:45,493 --> 00:15:46,904
I would know.

177
00:15:54,068 --> 00:15:55,445
Come with me.

178
00:16:03,578 --> 00:16:08,186
Right after my father died,
I would come up here a lot.

179
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:14,229
I'd imagine the whole world
was one big machine.

180
00:16:16,424 --> 00:16:19,871
Machines never come
with any extra parts, you know.

181
00:16:20,027 --> 00:16:24,407
They always come with
the exact amount they need.

182
00:16:24,565 --> 00:16:28,877
So I figured if the entire world
was one big machine...

183
00:16:31,005 --> 00:16:33,212
I couldn't be an extra part.

184
00:16:33,374 --> 00:16:36,378
I had to be here for some reason.

185
00:16:39,013 --> 00:16:42,426
And that means you have
to be here for some reason, too.

186
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,870
Get back.

187
00:17:03,771 --> 00:17:05,978
I'll bring Tabard
tomorrow night at 7:00.

188
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,518
Don't say anything.

189
00:17:09,644 --> 00:17:11,624
Are you sure about this?

190
00:17:13,147 --> 00:17:14,683
Not really.

191
00:17:16,517 --> 00:17:19,987
But I think it's the only way to...

192
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:23,666
To fix him.

193
00:17:46,147 --> 00:17:49,356
Hello. How was your day?

194
00:19:27,381 --> 00:19:30,157
Boy on the track!
There's a boy on the track!

195
00:19:30,351 --> 00:19:32,922
Get out of the way! There's a boy!

196
00:19:34,555 --> 00:19:35,693
Turn it off!

197
00:19:40,327 --> 00:19:44,400
Get out of the way! Move! Come on!

198
00:19:47,435 --> 00:19:49,108
Out!

199
00:20:07,988 --> 00:20:09,433
Look out!

200
00:22:17,952 --> 00:22:19,625
Morning.

201
00:22:20,321 --> 00:22:23,632
Yes, he's employed here.
Large, uncouth man.

202
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:27,098
In the Seine?

203
00:22:27,261 --> 00:22:29,434
Deceased? Are you sure?

204
00:22:34,068 --> 00:22:37,208
No, he has no... no relatives.

205
00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:41,213
Thank you, I'll...
I will gather his belongings.

206
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:43,548
Thank you so much.

207
00:22:51,819 --> 00:22:53,924
If he is deceased...

208
00:22:56,156 --> 00:22:59,330
then who has been
winding the clocks?

209
00:23:17,277 --> 00:23:20,087
- Good evening.
- This way, sir.

210
00:23:24,852 --> 00:23:26,297
I'll get it.

211
00:23:32,292 --> 00:23:36,502
Well, what a surprise.
Come in, come in.

212
00:23:38,766 --> 00:23:40,768
Isabelle, what's the meaning of this?

213
00:23:44,571 --> 00:23:46,312
Please don't be mad, Mama.

214
00:23:46,473 --> 00:23:50,046
That young man is not welcome here.

215
00:23:54,948 --> 00:23:57,986
We found out who Papa Georges is.

216
00:24:01,055 --> 00:24:04,696
I... I deeply apologize, madame.
I thought you were expecting us.

217
00:24:04,858 --> 00:24:07,566
I will leave immediately
and return upon your request.

218
00:24:07,728 --> 00:24:09,901
Please keep your voices down.

219
00:24:10,064 --> 00:24:13,511
My husband's sleeping.
He hasn't been well since...

220
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:16,341
No, Mama. Mama, please
don't make them leave.

221
00:24:16,503 --> 00:24:18,915
I don't wish to impose
on you, Madame Méliés,

222
00:24:19,073 --> 00:24:22,179
but if this is to be
the only time we meet,

223
00:24:22,342 --> 00:24:25,482
please, let me express to you

224
00:24:25,612 --> 00:24:28,718
the profound debt of gratitude
I owe your husband.

225
00:24:30,984 --> 00:24:35,228
When I was a boy,
I saw all his films.

226
00:24:36,323 --> 00:24:38,030
They inspired me.

227
00:24:38,926 --> 00:24:41,600
Your husband is a very great artist.

228
00:24:51,572 --> 00:24:57,352
I am so pleased you remember
my husband's films with such fondness.

229
00:24:58,545 --> 00:25:02,425
But... he's so fragile now.

230
00:25:04,852 --> 00:25:07,890
It only hurts him
to remember the past.

231
00:25:10,457 --> 00:25:13,199
Then we will take our leave, madame.

232
00:25:16,196 --> 00:25:19,109
And I do hope you'll
forgive me for saying...

233
00:25:20,968 --> 00:25:25,041
you are as lovely now
as you were in the movies.

234
00:25:26,573 --> 00:25:30,817
- Mama?
- You were in the movies?

235
00:25:30,978 --> 00:25:33,458
She appeared in almost all his films.

236
00:25:34,348 --> 00:25:37,386
- You were an actress?
- Well, I...

237
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:41,661
A long time ago, children. It was...

238
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:46,960
It was another time. I... I...

239
00:25:48,262 --> 00:25:50,071
Well, I was another person.

240
00:25:52,166 --> 00:25:54,442
Would you like to meet her again?

241
00:25:57,638 --> 00:25:59,515
We have a film.

242
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:03,419
One of Georges' films?

243
00:26:04,144 --> 00:26:06,124
That's not possible. They're all gone.

244
00:26:06,814 --> 00:26:08,987
May we show you?

245
00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:12,858
- Please.
- Yes, please, Mama. Please.

246
00:26:19,193 --> 00:26:21,036
Just be quick with it.

247
00:26:24,498 --> 00:26:26,842
You were an actress,
a real cinema actress!

248
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,470
- It's impossibly romantic, Mama.
- It wasn't like that.

249
00:26:30,637 --> 00:26:34,141
We weren't movie stars
like they have today.

250
00:26:36,777 --> 00:26:38,518
But we did have fun.

251
00:26:43,717 --> 00:26:45,321
Madame Méliés?

252
00:27:36,937 --> 00:27:38,507
It's in color!

253
00:27:38,639 --> 00:27:40,619
But of course.
We tinted the film.

254
00:27:40,774 --> 00:27:44,916
We painted it by hand,
frame by frame.

255
00:27:58,125 --> 00:27:59,866
Mama, it's you!

256
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:05,399
Yes.

257
00:28:33,126 --> 00:28:35,902
Oh, beautiful.

258
00:28:53,146 --> 00:28:55,285
You were beautiful.

259
00:28:55,449 --> 00:28:57,326
She still is.

260
00:29:18,038 --> 00:29:24,785
I would recognize the sound
of a movie projector anywhere.

261
00:29:30,384 --> 00:29:32,057
Georges...

262
00:29:33,787 --> 00:29:37,325
you've tried to forget
the past for so long.

263
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,498
It's brought you nothing
but unhappiness.

264
00:29:45,699 --> 00:29:48,578
Maybe it's time to try and remember.

265
00:30:01,381 --> 00:30:03,327
You want to know?

266
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,931
Yes.

267
00:30:11,925 --> 00:30:14,030
Just like you...

268
00:30:16,029 --> 00:30:18,600
I loved to fix things.

269
00:30:22,002 --> 00:30:24,573
I started out as a magician.

270
00:30:24,738 --> 00:30:27,378
Mama Jeanne was my assistant.

271
00:30:41,188 --> 00:30:44,795
<i>We were very successful, I must say.
We even had our own theater.</i>

272
00:31:12,152 --> 00:31:14,598
<i>But! Was always tinkering
with machines.</i>

273
00:31:14,754 --> 00:31:20,432
<i>I had my own workshop at the theater,
where I could invent new illusions.</i>

274
00:31:20,594 --> 00:31:23,131
<i>Once, I even built a
working automaton.</i>

275
00:31:23,296 --> 00:31:26,903
<i>Oh, he... was a particular treasure.</i>

276
00:31:27,067 --> 00:31:31,311
<i>I put my heart and soul into him.</i>

277
00:31:35,342 --> 00:31:38,585
<i>Then, one night, Mama Jeanne and I</i>

278
00:31:38,745 --> 00:31:41,624
<i>went to visit a traveling circus.</i>

279
00:31:41,781 --> 00:31:46,696
<i>We were walking past the sideshow tents
when I noticed something.</i>

280
00:31:46,853 --> 00:31:50,630
<i>Something strange.
Something wonderful.</i>

281
00:31:50,757 --> 00:31:52,532
It will terrify you!

282
00:31:52,692 --> 00:31:56,469
Sir, madame, inside we have
moving pictures! Come and see!

283
00:31:58,598 --> 00:32:02,876
<i>The Lumière brothers
had invented the movies.</i>

284
00:32:16,816 --> 00:32:20,127
<i>I fell in love with their invention.
How could I not he part of it?</i>

285
00:32:20,887 --> 00:32:24,198
<i>It was like...
It was like a new kind of magic.</i>

286
00:32:25,659 --> 00:32:29,971
<i>I asked the Lumière brothers
to sell me a camera, but they refused.</i>

287
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:33,873
You see, they were convinced
that movies were only <i>a</i> passing fad

288
00:32:34,034 --> 00:32:37,447
<i>and they saw no future in it,
or so they said.</i>

289
00:32:37,637 --> 00:32:40,447
<i>In the end, I built my own camera</i>

290
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,484
<i>using leftover pieces
from the automaton.</i>

291
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:46,921
<i>I just had to he a part
of this new wonder.</i>

292
00:32:48,415 --> 00:32:52,761
<i>We risked everything. And we sold
the theater and everything we had</i>

293
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:55,923
<i>so we could build
our own movie studio.</i>

294
00:32:56,089 --> 00:32:57,500
Excellent.

295
00:32:59,726 --> 00:33:01,672
Cameras, are we clear?

296
00:33:02,596 --> 00:33:05,076
<i>And so the great adventure began.</i>

297
00:33:05,232 --> 00:33:07,576
Actors only on the set, please!
Clear the set!

298
00:33:07,734 --> 00:33:10,738
Look at you, look at you!
Love this shape, Mel.

299
00:33:10,904 --> 00:33:12,247
It's a toile, though, right?

300
00:33:14,274 --> 00:33:18,620
<i>I wrote, designed,
directed, and acted</i>

301
00:33:18,778 --> 00:33:21,349
<i>in hundreds of movies.</i>

302
00:33:21,514 --> 00:33:22,584
I'm ready.

303
00:33:30,957 --> 00:33:34,404
That was good,
that was good, yes, yes.

304
00:33:34,561 --> 00:33:37,007
That felt good, that felt good.
On the pulley? On the smoke?

305
00:33:54,314 --> 00:33:56,089
Stop, stop, stop. I saw that.

306
00:33:56,249 --> 00:33:58,286
Give me two minutes.
It was good up to there.

307
00:33:58,451 --> 00:34:00,431
Benny? I'm gonna have a word.

308
00:34:00,587 --> 00:34:03,397
Reload. Reset the dragon.

309
00:34:03,556 --> 00:34:05,092
Benny, speak to me.

310
00:34:05,258 --> 00:34:06,999
If you pull down a little harder
on the left-hand rope,

311
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,162
the head will come up higher,
which will be better...

312
00:34:09,329 --> 00:34:11,502
- Under the belly!
- I see it.

313
00:34:11,665 --> 00:34:13,474
Excellent, excellent, excellent.

314
00:34:13,633 --> 00:34:16,113
The choreography was really good
up to there. Thank you, gentlemen.

315
00:34:16,269 --> 00:34:19,307
- First positions!
- Back, first positions!

316
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,117
Action!

317
00:34:38,792 --> 00:34:40,965
Excellent, excellent. Setting back.

318
00:34:41,127 --> 00:34:43,733
And in for the kill, knights.
In for the kill!

319
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:46,274
Come on, then, attack!

320
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:49,677
Stabbing, stabbing, and lunge!

321
00:34:50,203 --> 00:34:51,910
Good.

322
00:34:57,344 --> 00:34:59,881
Good, good. Good, knights.
Poised for the attack.

323
00:35:01,114 --> 00:35:03,617
And... knights!

324
00:35:03,783 --> 00:35:07,890
Three, two, one, freeze!

325
00:35:08,054 --> 00:35:09,727
Skeletons, that's great. You can go.

326
00:35:09,889 --> 00:35:12,130
Pyrotechnics in, please.
Knights, please don't move.

327
00:35:12,292 --> 00:35:15,239
Freeze. Freeze, everybody.
Wait for my "action."

328
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:20,407
Three, two, one, action!

329
00:35:25,872 --> 00:35:30,184
<i>Magic tricks and illusion
became my specialty.</i>

330
00:35:30,343 --> 00:35:33,552
<i>The world of imagination.</i>

331
00:35:42,055 --> 00:35:47,061
<i>My beautiful wife
was my muse, my star.</i>

332
00:35:47,227 --> 00:35:49,503
<i>And we couldn't have been happier.</i>

333
00:35:49,662 --> 00:35:51,232
Action!

334
00:36:01,374 --> 00:36:03,615
<i>We thought it would never end.</i>

335
00:36:04,878 --> 00:36:06,357
<i>How could it?</i>

336
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:13,430
<i>But then the war came.</i>

337
00:36:15,054 --> 00:36:17,762
<i>And youth and hope were at an end.</i>

338
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:26,874
<i>The world had no time
for magic tricks and movie shows.</i>

339
00:36:27,033 --> 00:36:30,913
<i>The returning soldiers,
having seen so much of reality,</i>

340
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:33,209
<i>were bored by my films.</i>

341
00:36:33,373 --> 00:36:39,119
<i>Tastes had changed,
but I had not changed with them.</i>

342
00:36:40,613 --> 00:36:42,854
No one wanted <i>my</i> movies any more.

343
00:36:44,984 --> 00:36:47,726
<i>Eventually I...
I couldn't pay the actors...</i>

344
00:36:48,521 --> 00:36:50,398
<i>or keep the business
running, and...</i>

345
00:36:51,524 --> 00:36:54,835
<i>and so my enchanted castle
fell to ruin.</i>

346
00:36:54,994 --> 00:36:56,974
<i>Everything was lost.</i>

347
00:36:58,164 --> 00:37:00,144
<i>One night, in hitter despair, I...</i>

348
00:37:02,235 --> 00:37:05,182
<i>I burned all my old sets
and costumes.</i>

349
00:37:18,184 --> 00:37:20,790
<i>I was forced to sell my movies
to a company</i>

350
00:37:20,954 --> 00:37:23,867
<i>that melted them down
into chemicals.</i>

351
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:30,639
These chemicals were used
to make shoe heels.

352
00:37:36,169 --> 00:37:40,379
<i>With the little money I had from selling
my films, I bought the toy booth...</i>

353
00:37:42,609 --> 00:37:44,418
<i>and there I have remained.</i>

354
00:37:48,047 --> 00:37:53,326
The only thing I couldn't bring myself
to destroy was my beloved automaton.

355
00:37:55,321 --> 00:38:00,134
So I gave him to a museum,
hoping he would find a home.

356
00:38:00,293 --> 00:38:04,241
But they never put him on display.
And then the museum burned.

357
00:38:05,832 --> 00:38:09,245
It's all gone now.
Everything I ever made.

358
00:38:10,803 --> 00:38:14,717
Nothing but ashes
and fading strips of celluloid.

359
00:38:18,011 --> 00:38:20,855
My life has taught me
one lesson, Hugo,

360
00:38:21,014 --> 00:38:24,257
and not the one I thought it would.

361
00:38:24,417 --> 00:38:27,398
Happy endings
only happen in the movies.

362
00:38:32,158 --> 00:38:34,365
I'll be right back.

363
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:05,961
Stop that! No, no!
Don't you frighten Monsieur Frick.

364
00:39:06,859 --> 00:39:09,305
Schatzi, what's he got?
What has he got?

365
00:39:12,532 --> 00:39:16,480
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness me.

366
00:39:21,608 --> 00:39:23,451
Did you see that?

367
00:39:25,278 --> 00:39:29,317
Be brave. My brave soldier.

368
00:39:37,357 --> 00:39:39,997
Monsieur Frick, I am undone!

369
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,421
- Good evening.
- Ah, hello.

370
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:06,928
There has been
a disquieting development.

371
00:40:07,053 --> 00:40:09,590
- What is it?
- You know Monsieur Claude?

372
00:40:10,189 --> 00:40:11,964
He's been found deceased.

373
00:40:13,459 --> 00:40:15,302
- No.
- Monsieur Claude!

374
00:40:15,461 --> 00:40:18,601
Consequently, he will no longer be
employed here winding the clocks.

375
00:40:18,765 --> 00:40:21,302
You've got a little friend. Look!

376
00:40:21,467 --> 00:40:23,640
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

377
00:40:23,803 --> 00:40:26,283
Monsieur Claude is dead.

378
00:40:28,374 --> 00:40:31,184
What? Why?

379
00:40:31,344 --> 00:40:32,550
What happened to him?

380
00:40:32,712 --> 00:40:35,192
They found his corpse in the Seine.

381
00:40:35,348 --> 00:40:37,885
It's been down there
for many months, it seems.

382
00:40:38,051 --> 00:40:39,621
Can't say I'm surprised.

383
00:40:39,786 --> 00:40:42,323
He was an inebriant
of the highest order.

384
00:40:42,488 --> 00:40:44,627
- Well, yes, he was a drunk.
- Shoo.

385
00:40:44,791 --> 00:40:48,238
- Oh, I wouldn't say that.
- Yes, he was a drunk!

386
00:40:48,394 --> 00:40:49,702
Scram! Shoo!

387
00:40:49,862 --> 00:40:51,808
He could've drunk
the entire River Seine.

388
00:40:51,964 --> 00:40:54,911
Please, go away! Go!

389
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:58,843
Hold it!

390
00:40:59,005 --> 00:41:02,316
- Let me go! Let me go!
- Did you think you'd escape me?

391
00:41:02,475 --> 00:41:05,581
- Gustave, have a heart!
- Please, help me!

392
00:41:09,782 --> 00:41:11,762
- Please.
- No.

393
00:41:11,918 --> 00:41:15,058
He's been undermining
this station for too long.

394
00:41:15,221 --> 00:41:17,030
Come on!

395
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:19,033
- What's the boy done?
- Let me go!

396
00:41:19,192 --> 00:41:20,865
- You happy now, boy?!
- Don't do this!

397
00:41:21,027 --> 00:41:22,335
Do not leave my office.

398
00:41:22,495 --> 00:41:24,771
You don't understand, I've got to go.

399
00:41:24,931 --> 00:41:27,207
You'll go nowhere
until your parents are found.

400
00:41:27,366 --> 00:41:28,674
I don't have any!

401
00:41:28,835 --> 00:41:31,577
Then it's straight
to the orphanage with you.

402
00:41:31,738 --> 00:41:35,447
You'll learn a thing or two there.
I certainly did.

403
00:41:35,608 --> 00:41:38,680
How to follow orders.
How to keep to yourself.

404
00:41:38,845 --> 00:41:40,882
How to survive without a family.

405
00:41:41,047 --> 00:41:45,962
Because you don't need one.
You don't need a family.

406
00:41:48,454 --> 00:41:50,730
Police headquarters,
7th arrondissement?

407
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:54,463
Yes, it's me again. Another orphan.

408
00:41:55,261 --> 00:41:57,366
Has been a busy week.

409
00:41:58,064 --> 00:42:03,036
Trespass, theft, pilfering,
littering, pillorying,

410
00:42:03,169 --> 00:42:06,048
walking about, playing. It's irrelevant.

411
00:42:06,172 --> 00:42:07,981
Please come and pick him up.

412
00:42:08,641 --> 00:42:10,587
Anyway, how are you?

413
00:42:10,743 --> 00:42:13,155
Oh, she came back?

414
00:42:13,312 --> 00:42:16,452
Oh, you think it's yours? Excellent.

415
00:42:17,283 --> 00:42:20,264
Well, I suppose you'll find out
in seven months.

416
00:42:20,419 --> 00:42:24,629
Pardon me. Oh, in March?
I'll try to come.

417
00:42:24,791 --> 00:42:27,465
I... I tend not to plan that far ahead.

418
00:42:28,161 --> 00:42:29,606
Are you sure?

419
00:42:30,596 --> 00:42:32,337
Well, oh, that's very flattering.

420
00:42:32,498 --> 00:42:35,411
I don't know really whether it's
appropriate for me to be the godfa...

421
00:42:36,903 --> 00:42:38,314
Sir, hold on!

422
00:42:46,913 --> 00:42:48,756
Maximilian!

423
00:42:50,249 --> 00:42:51,319
Move!

424
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:56,932
Move aside! Get out of the way!

425
00:43:23,482 --> 00:43:25,860
Maximilian, find him!

426
00:43:29,355 --> 00:43:31,301
You can't escape me!

427
00:43:52,712 --> 00:43:55,716
There's nowhere to hide up there, boy!

428
00:44:15,534 --> 00:44:17,775
307, 308, 309

429
00:45:32,278 --> 00:45:35,816
Maximilian, he's gone
the other way. Come on!

430
00:46:38,711 --> 00:46:39,746
You!

431
00:46:40,546 --> 00:46:42,219
Get out of my way!

432
00:46:44,984 --> 00:46:46,463
GOI you!

433
00:47:15,247 --> 00:47:16,590
No!

434
00:47:19,318 --> 00:47:22,390
There's a boy! Turn it off!
There's a boy on the track!

435
00:47:26,358 --> 00:47:27,359
Get out of the way!

436
00:47:37,636 --> 00:47:40,446
Move back! Move aside! Move back!

437
00:47:40,606 --> 00:47:42,779
What were you thinking?
Are you injured?

438
00:47:43,576 --> 00:47:44,987
Come on!

439
00:47:46,245 --> 00:47:48,282
Stand aside. Careful.

440
00:47:50,883 --> 00:47:52,829
We'll let the orphanage deal with you.

441
00:47:52,985 --> 00:47:55,261
- No, I don't belong there!
- Where do you belong?

442
00:47:55,421 --> 00:47:57,332
A child has to belong to somewhere.

443
00:47:57,490 --> 00:48:00,130
Listen to me, please!
Please, listen to me!

444
00:48:00,292 --> 00:48:03,330
You don't understand.
You have to let me go.

445
00:48:04,263 --> 00:48:09,804
I don't understand why my father died,

446
00:48:09,969 --> 00:48:11,812
why I'm alone.

447
00:48:13,572 --> 00:48:16,314
This is my only chance...

448
00:48:17,476 --> 00:48:19,478
to work.

449
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:23,492
You should understand!

450
00:48:29,355 --> 00:48:30,834
<i>I do!</i>

451
00:48:33,926 --> 00:48:35,496
I do.

452
00:48:39,265 --> 00:48:40,642
Monsieur...

453
00:48:44,036 --> 00:48:45,947
this child belongs to me.

454
00:49:06,458 --> 00:49:08,904
I'm sorry. He's broken.

455
00:49:09,061 --> 00:49:12,065
No, he's not.

456
00:49:14,066 --> 00:49:16,740
He worked perfectly

457
00:49:41,093 --> 00:49:44,097
<i>Honored guests, lam proud</i>

458
00:49:44,363 --> 00:49:46,934
to welcome you to this gala

459
00:49:47,099 --> 00:49:52,071
celebrating the life and work
of Georges Mélies!

460
00:49:57,943 --> 00:50:01,584
For years, most of his films
were thought to be lost.

461
00:50:01,747 --> 00:50:05,524
Indeed, Monsieur Mélies
believed so himself.

462
00:50:05,651 --> 00:50:07,562
But we began a search.

463
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:11,133
We looked through vaults,
through private collections,

464
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:14,760
barns and catacombs.

465
00:50:15,461 --> 00:50:18,635
Our work was rewarded
with old negatives,

466
00:50:18,797 --> 00:50:23,746
boxes of prints, and trunks
full of decaying film,

467
00:50:23,902 --> 00:50:26,109
which we were able to save.

468
00:50:26,272 --> 00:50:30,220
We now have over 80 films
by Georges Méliés.

469
00:50:35,948 --> 00:50:38,986
And tonight, their creator,

470
00:50:39,151 --> 00:50:42,928
and the newest member
of the Film Academy faculty,

471
00:50:43,088 --> 00:50:45,932
is here to share them with you.

472
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,751
Bravo!

473
00:51:08,814 --> 00:51:09,849
Bravo!

474
00:51:21,126 --> 00:51:22,935
Ladies and gentlemen...

475
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:26,166
I...

476
00:51:35,674 --> 00:51:38,814
I am standing before you tonight...

477
00:51:40,312 --> 00:51:43,452
because of one
very brave young man...

478
00:51:46,385 --> 00:51:51,391
who saw a broken machine...

479
00:51:53,859 --> 00:51:58,137
and, against all odds, he fixed it.

480
00:52:01,066 --> 00:52:04,206
It was the kindest magic trick...

481
00:52:05,637 --> 00:52:07,844
that ever I've seen.

482
00:52:15,981 --> 00:52:20,327
And now, my friends,

483
00:52:20,486 --> 00:52:26,767
I address you all tonight
as you truly are:

484
00:52:26,925 --> 00:52:31,203
Wizards, mermaids...

485
00:52:32,531 --> 00:52:37,913
travelers, adventurers... magicians.

486
00:52:45,377 --> 00:52:49,848
Come and dream with me.

487
00:54:18,937 --> 00:54:24,819
Yes, you can start with the thaumatrope,
the zoetrope, the praxinoscope.

488
00:54:24,977 --> 00:54:27,981
Any study of the history of film
must begin with the...

489
00:54:28,146 --> 00:54:30,524
Poppy? The cave pictographs at...

490
00:54:30,682 --> 00:54:32,161
- Niaux.
- Niaux.

491
00:54:32,317 --> 00:54:35,230
About canine socialization.

492
00:54:35,387 --> 00:54:36,991
Not canine romance?

493
00:54:37,155 --> 00:54:41,001
Oh, Monsieur Frick, do I detect
a pearl in your oyster?

494
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:44,231
The boy designed it.
It does not squeak at all.

495
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:46,671
Don't forget to smile, darling.

496
00:54:46,832 --> 00:54:49,472
Well, which one?
I've mastered three of them.

497
00:54:51,403 --> 00:54:55,909
Don't worry. I'm now a fully
functioning man. Aren't I, dear?

498
00:54:56,074 --> 00:55:00,819
Tap the deck. And it's up,
it's up, it's up... It's there!

499
00:55:02,648 --> 00:55:05,060
- Is this your card?
- That is my card.

500
00:55:07,019 --> 00:55:12,697
<i>Once upon</i> a <i>time,
I met</i> a <i>boy named Hugo Cabret.</i>

501
00:55:13,825 --> 00:55:16,772
<i>He lived in a train station.</i>

502
00:55:16,929 --> 00:55:22,504
<i>"Why did he live in a train station?"
you might well ask.</i>

503
00:55:23,368 --> 00:55:26,508
<i>That's really what this hook
is going to he about.</i>

504
00:55:27,406 --> 00:55:31,912
<i>It's about how this
singular young man</i>

505
00:55:32,077 --> 00:55:36,583
<i>searched so hard to find
a secret message from his father...</i>

506
00:55:38,183 --> 00:55:42,222
<i>and how that message
lit his way...</i>

507
00:55:44,489 --> 00:55:46,560
<i>all the way home.</i>
