01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:18,080
你愛我嗎？我愛你
Do you love me?
I love you.

862
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:23,370
描述我內心該追求的元素，才能確定
Describe the elements
I should be looking for
within myself
to be sure.

863
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:25,910
你有沒有感受到？
You just feel it or not.
So it is
no evidence base,
as God would say.

864
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:29,660
所以就像上帝說的，沒有實證基礎

865
01:05:30,410 --> 01:05:33,040
- 實證上如何判斷？
- 你在說什麼？
So how judge it
empirically?
What the fuck
are you talking about?
Who are you?

866
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,160
你是誰？
You don't know
what bananas are,

867
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:36,950
你不知道香蕉是什麼，沒聽過西洋棋
you've never heard
of chess,

868
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:38,750
卻知道「實證」的意思
and yet you know
what "empirically" means.
Bella wants a drink.
I said twice now.

869
01:05:38,910 --> 01:05:41,500
貝拉想喝酒，我說兩次了
I've never felt
anything like this.

870
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:44,120
我從來沒有這種感覺
Is this true
for you?

871
01:05:44,290 --> 01:05:45,700
你也是嗎？

872
01:05:47,790 --> 01:05:49,450
我想實證上是
I suppose,
empirically it is.

873
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:52,910
（葛溫）
I'm out of ink.

874
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:54,950
沒墨水了

875
01:05:55,268 --> 01:05:56,272
Oh.

876
01:05:59,870 --> 01:06:01,370
墨水馬上來，吾愛
Then ink
you shall have,
my love.

877
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:17,080
你好，有趣的老太太
BELLA: Hello,
interesting older lady.
I must touch
your hair.

878
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:18,870
我得摸摸你的頭髮

879
01:06:21,290 --> 01:06:23,000
我也注意到你的頭髮
I also noticed
your hair.
Just like silk
on a translucent,
glowing egg.

880
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:27,160
宛如晶瑩剔透的蛋上的細絲

881
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:30,200
好華麗的詞藻，令我興奮
That is fancy words
that excite me somehow.

882
01:06:30,370 --> 01:06:33,200
我發現你和那位俊男在一起
WOMAN: I saw
you're with handsome
over there.
White teeth
and a hard cock.

883
01:06:33,370 --> 01:06:35,500
有一口白牙與硬挺肉棒

884
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:38,040
鄧肯魏德本
Duncan Wedderburn.
His teeth are also hard.
His penis is also white.

885
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:41,540
他的牙齒也很硬，陰莖也很白

886
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:43,660
- 希望床上功夫一流
- 他是我的唯一
Good lay, I hope.
He is my only.

887
01:06:43,830 --> 01:06:48,160
我發現他能刺激我全身的感官
But I find him to elicit
exceptional sensations
throughout my whole body
that leave me
yelping happily.

888
01:06:48,330 --> 01:06:50,500
讓我開心地尖叫
I also wish to dash
his body, form,
cadaver, into the sea.

889
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:54,580
我也想將他身體、形體、屍體丟入海

890
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:56,540
這個人在你身上跳躍嗎？
Is this man
jumping on your body?
(CHUCKLES)
WOMAN: No, he is not.

891
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:58,450
沒有
I haven't been bedded
in 20 years.

892
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:00,620
我20年沒跟人上床了
What?

893
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:01,750
什麼？

894
01:07:02,410 --> 01:07:03,580
太慘了
That is terrible.
It doesn't
concern me greatly.

895
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:05,580
我不太在意

896
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:07,750
年紀大了
As years
have passed,
what's in between my ears
is my big concern.

897
01:07:07,910 --> 01:07:10,540
我比較關心雙耳之間的東西

898
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:13,080
至於雙腿之間…
What's in between
my legs...

899
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:15,660
沒那麼要緊
much less so.

900
01:07:15,830 --> 01:07:18,080
好牽強的理由，瑪莎
A desperate
rationalization,
Martha.

901
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:20,450
這位是哈利艾斯利
Oh, this
is Harry Astley.
Don't take
what he says
too much to heart.

902
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:23,660
別太在意他說的話

903
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:25,250
他就愛挖苦人
He's a cynic.

904
01:07:25,830 --> 01:07:26,910
女士
Madam.

905
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:29,000
我是貝拉貝斯特
I am Bella Baxter.

906
01:07:29,950 --> 01:07:32,290
我不知道「挖苦」是什麼
I do not know
what this "cynic" is.
Bella. (CLEARS THROAT)

907
01:07:32,450 --> 01:07:33,290
貝拉

908
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:34,870
墨水來了
Ink.

909
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:35,950
鄧肯魏德本
Duncan Wedderburn,
I have made friends,
colleagues, comrades.

910
01:07:36,370 --> 01:07:39,160
我交了朋友、同夥、同好
Harry Astley.

911
01:07:39,330 --> 01:07:40,790
哈利艾斯利
BELLA:
This is Martha.

912
01:07:40,950 --> 01:07:42,450
這是瑪莎
She is my new friend
who has not been fucked
in 20 years.

913
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:45,750
她是我的新朋友，20年沒打炮

914
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:47,500
是不是很驚人？
Is that not
astonishment?
I hope you use your hand
between your legs

915
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:51,120
希望你用手自摸，讓自己爽
to keep yourself happy.
(MARTHA CHUCKLES)

916
01:07:51,290 --> 01:07:54,750
天啊，貝拉，你不能說這種話
Good God, Bella,
you cannot speak
like this.

917
01:07:54,910 --> 01:07:57,000
社會禮儀，我忘了
Polites of society.
I forgot.
HARRY: Polite society

918
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:58,620
有禮的社會…
will destroy you.
BELLA: It will?

919
01:07:58,790 --> 01:08:00,200
會毀了你

920
01:08:00,370 --> 01:08:02,500
- 是嗎？
- 有幾分道理
Yeah, there...
there's some truth
to that.
MARTHA:
We all agreed on that.

921
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:04,450
我們都認同
As to your enquiry on my hand.

922
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:06,950
至於你提到我的手
Occasionally, yes.

923
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:08,950
偶爾會派上用場
That is much
reassuring news.

924
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:11,370
這樣就讓人放心多了

925
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:14,700
- 我們一起用餐
- 其實…
We shall
all dine together.
Well, actually...

926
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,410
我們在船上，跑不掉
We are all on a ship
and cannot escape,
and there is a world
to enjoy, traverse, circumnavigate.

927
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:20,660
有一個世界能享受、穿越、遊歷

928
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:23,700
她不能交朋友嗎，魏德本先生？
Or can she not
have friends,
Mr. Wedderburn?

929
01:08:24,830 --> 01:08:25,950
真有趣
(CHUCKLES)
Delighted.

930
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:30,370
嫁給我
Marry me.

931
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:31,370
什麼？
What?
I meant to
throw you aside.

932
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:32,870
我本來想拋棄你
A few months
and send you packing,
but I cannot.

933
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:35,580
幾個月後叫你走人，但我做不到

934
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:38,410
說你願意，只有你擄獲我的心
Say you'll
marry me.
No one's ever
captured my heart.
You have.

935
01:08:39,830 --> 01:08:41,080
不方便
It is tricky,
as I am engaged
to Mr. Max McCandles.

936
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:43,660
我與邁斯麥坎多先生訂婚了

937
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:45,790
什麼？
What?

938
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:49,000
我已托付終身給別人
My hand has taken
by another.

939
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:52,620
我聽過這句成語，但我不懂
It is a saying I heard,
but did not understand.
You do not take
just the hand,
but all, do you not?

940
01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:55,950
不能只有托付身體，對吧？

941
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:58,700
你跟我私奔，離開他了啊
You ran away
with me from him.

942
01:08:58,870 --> 01:09:02,120
發生過的事又講一遍，用意何在
A recounting
of events,
the point of which
is elusive to me.

943
01:09:02,290 --> 01:09:03,580
你選了我，沒選他
You chose me
over him.

944
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:05,250
那是現在
For now.

945
01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:06,450
因為好玩
For fun.
I'll fucking
throw you
overboard!

946
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:09,290
我會把你扔下船
So you wish
to marry me
or kill me?

947
01:09:09,450 --> 01:09:12,410
你到底想娶我還是殺我？

948
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:15,250
- 這是求婚嗎？
- 不是
Is that
the proposal?
No.

949
01:09:31,290 --> 01:09:32,700
我去賭場
(VOICE BREAKS)
Going to the casino.

950
01:09:36,104 --> 01:09:37,635
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

951
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,160
沒關係
BAXTER:
Uh, that's fine.

952
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:47,120
她會學會的
MAX: She is
coming along.

953
01:09:47,290 --> 01:09:48,870
再試一次
BAXTER:
Let's try again.

954
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:52,910
大肌肉動作技巧會慢慢發展
Gross motor skills
will develop slowly,

955
01:09:53,370 --> 01:09:55,790
但你進步會很快
but you will
progress fast.

956
01:09:57,790 --> 01:09:58,830
費莉西蒂
MAX:
Felicity.

957
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
別操之過急
Not that fast.

958
01:10:04,509 --> 01:10:05,767
(CRYING)

959
01:10:15,830 --> 01:10:17,700
我在讀愛默生的書
I am reading Emerson.
He speaks about
the improvement of men.

960
01:10:17,870 --> 01:10:20,290
他談到男人如何改進
I do not know
why he does not give
advice to women.

961
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:23,540
我不懂他為何不給女人建議
Perhaps he does
not know any.

962
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:25,290
或許他根本沒想法

963
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:29,040
看看歌德的書
Try and read
Goethe.
Philosophy is
a waste of time,
Bella.

964
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,750
哲學是在浪費時間，貝拉

965
01:10:31,910 --> 01:10:34,120
真的嗎？多說一點
Really?
Say more.
No, no, Harry,
you wretch.

966
01:10:34,290 --> 01:10:36,200
不，哈利，你嘴賤
It is integral.

967
01:10:36,370 --> 01:10:37,330
它是不可或缺的

968
01:10:38,370 --> 01:10:41,450
人和社會都可以改進
People and society
can be improved.

969
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:46,290
所有人的目標都是改善、進步、成長
It is the goal
of all to improve,
advance, progress, grow.

970
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:49,830
我是如此，相信大家跟我一樣
I know this in me,
and I am sure
I am indicative of all.
Trust me, you are
definitely unique,
Bella, in all ways.

971
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,040
相信我，你十分獨特，各方面都是

972
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:57,750
但是透過哲學來改進
But this improvement
through philosophy

973
01:10:57,910 --> 01:11:02,000
只是人們想逃避我們都是猛獸的事實
is people trying
to run away
from the fact
that we are all
cruel beasts.

974
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:04,450
天生如此，死時亦然
Born that way,
die that way.

975
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:07,290
這種看法好負面，哈利
It is a dark view
of things, Harry.

976
01:11:07,450 --> 01:11:08,370
貝拉
Bella...

977
01:11:09,910 --> 01:11:11,370
我們換個地方
let us take
the air...

978
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:14,540
到艙房去
in our cabin.

979
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:16,250
他們倆在吵架
But these two
are fighting,

980
01:11:16,410 --> 01:11:19,200
貝拉腦中和心中好多想法在激盪
and ideas are banging around
in Bella's head and heart
like lights in a storm.

981
01:11:19,370 --> 01:11:21,000
有如暴風雨中的閃電
DUNCAN: Oh.

982
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:26,080
你總是在看書，貝拉
You're always
reading now, Bella.

983
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:30,160
說話變得沒那麼可愛了
You're losing some of
your adorable way of speaking.

984
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:32,000
我是可變換的饗宴
BELLA: I am
a changingable feast,
as are all of we.

985
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,410
我們都是
Apparently
according to Emerson,

986
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:36,410
這是愛默生的說法，哈利不認同
disagreed with by Harry.
DUNCAN: Come, come.
Just come.

987
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:37,870
走啦，過來嘛

988
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:41,160
你擋到我的陽光
You are in my sun.

989
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:42,790
什麼？
What?

990
01:12:07,006 --> 01:12:08,838
(ENGINE CHUGGING)

991
01:12:08,974 --> 01:12:10,437
(SHIP GROANS SOFTLY)

01:12:11,535 --> 01:12:13,305
(CHATTER AND LAUGHTER)

993
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:22,500

to ruin me.

1280

I look at you, and I see
nothing but ugliness.

and makes no sense,
as your odes to my beauty
have been boring

1282
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:48,660

that you would rise
to the occasion.

1306
01:30:41,370 --> 01:30:44,660
我發現我錯了，你顯然不堪一擊
But now I see
that was a mistake,
and there's clearly
something broken in you.

1307
01:30:44,830 --> 01:30:47,040
你擊垮了我的心
You broke
that something in me!
I feel this conversation
has become circular.

我能再找一個愛人
I could take a lover,
another Wedderburn

an awful lot of attention.

1314
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:08,160

So, you are mesmerized
no more?

Does the whoring thing
challenge the desire

so can men and women

Did we miss the part about
anyone objecting to this?

她為什麼不快樂？
What was the root

她為何從橋上往下跳？
What drove her
to leap off the bridge?

1848
02:03:20,830 --> 02:03:22,500
你討厭那個寶寶
You hated the baby.
You called it "the monster."

1849
02:03:22,660 --> 02:03:24,250
你叫它「怪物」

原來如此
I see.

1851

我注意到我缺乏母性本能

a lack of maternal instinct.

Kind? You would never
be so dull, Victoria.
