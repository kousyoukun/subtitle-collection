1
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,500
Ba.

2
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,125
Ba! Ba!

3
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,708
Ba, ba, ba.

4
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,500
-Bye.
-Ba, ba.

5
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,166
A pile of organs

6
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,500
without the spark of self
from a brain

7
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,750
or the pump of blood
from a heart.

8
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,708
Just a butcher's tray
for a Sunday lunch.

9
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:15,666
Now, who would like
to reconstruct the organs?

10
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,583
And who can tell human
from animal,

11
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,750
if there is a difference?

12
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:24,791
Come, come.

13
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,916
You did puzzles as children,
did you not?

14
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,708
Is it just me, or is it
devilishly hard to concentrate

15
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,291
when the monster's talking?

16
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,583
He is
an extraordinary surgeon.

17
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,291
His research
is groundbreaking.

18
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,583
His father founded this place.

19
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,458
Have you
mistaken yourself as included

20
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,500
in this conversation,
Max McCandles?

21
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,125
Your physical proximity to us
does not make it so.

22
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,666
Fuck off, old pal.
Get yourself a suit.

23
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,666
You really think that's
where the liver goes, sir?

24
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,541
Can I ask what is the purpose
of putting them back in, sir?

25
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,250
My amusement.

26
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,208
Mr. Max McCandles!

27
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:06,625
Walk with me
at the end of the lesson.

28
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,333
Your paper.

29
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,500
You liked it, sir?

30
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,791
It showed signs
of a conventional mind

31
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:20,541
straining hard
to almost touch mediocrity.

32
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:21,916
Thank you.
I need someone.

33
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,416
-An assistant on a project.
-I would love to.

34
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,458
-Are you a religious man?
-I believe in God.

35
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,166
Me or the deity?

36
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,708
Humorous, as you're
often known as the...

37
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,291
It is a joke
of my own making.

38
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,583
I do not need it
explicated for me.

39
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:36,791
The very devil's work.

40
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,666
Have you thought
of growing a beard, sir?

41
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,000
I look like
a big dog in a cravat.

42
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,291
Kids like dogs.

43
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:44,041
Uh, this job.

44
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,541
Yes. Come.

45
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,125
God! God.

46
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,375
-God.

47
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,708
-Hello.
-Hello.

48
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:22,375
Bella, this is Mr. McCandles.

49
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,000
Hello, Bella.

50
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,041
-Oh. Uh...

51
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,250
-Bud.
-Blood.

52
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,625
-Bud.
-Blood.

53
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,291
-Blood.
-Marvelous.

54
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,666
I'm fine. I'm fine.

55
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,625
What a very pretty retard.

56
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:45,000
She suffered
a brain injury.

57
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,375
I repaired it.

58
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:49,916
Her mental age and her body
are not quite synchronized.

59
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,250
Language is coming.

60
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:54,250
She is progressing
at an accelerated pace.

61
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,708
She is stunning.

62
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,625
I need
to meticulously note

63
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:00,875
her progression.

64
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,166
You will do this for me?

65
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,250
It would be my honor.

66
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,375
Wee!

67
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,375
Wee!

68
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:10,458
Yes.
It is exciting, Bella.

69
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,125
"Wee."
I believe she's doing...

70
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,708
Mrs. Prim!

71
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:17,833
Wee.

72
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,791
Do you not like kippers?

73
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,458
Uh, I am quite partial
to them, actually.

74
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:29,000
I find them to be, uh,
nice in the morning...

75
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,916
Bella cut, too?

76
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,916
Just dead ones for Bella.

77
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Just dead.

78
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,416
Just dead.

79
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,833
Just dead.

80
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,291
Squish! Squish, squish.

81
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,916
-Chog!

82
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,083
Chog!

83
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,375
-Run!

84
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,041
Chog.

85
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,500
She... She gathers
15 words a day.

86
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:54,875
Hmm.

87
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,666
Her coordination
is unstable at best.

88
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,333
In the evenings,
there's progress.

89
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:00,708
Mm.

90
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:03,208
Her hair grows one inch
every two days.

91
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,333
-I have a hair diagram here.
-Excellent.

92
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,250
You may go. See you tomorrow.

93
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,250
Sir, where did she come from?

94
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:15,083
I believe your job
is collecting data.

95
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:18,583
When I add inane questions
to it, I'll let you know.

96
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,125
"And so, when they returned
from the wood,

97
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:29,916
"she was reunited
with her Mummy and Daddy.

98
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,958
"That night, for dinner,

99
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,416
"they ate cake
until they were sick.

100
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:39,625
"They were so happy
to be back together."

101
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,416
You me Daddy, God?

102
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,583
-Prim say you not be.

103
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,041
Bella nowhere girl.

104
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,875
Where that be? Nowhere?

105
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,208
You are an orphan.

106
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,375
Your parents died.

107
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:02,541
Then you cut parents up, God?

108
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:03,625
No.

109
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,041
They were my friends.

110
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,583
They were brave explorers,

111
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,875
and they were killed
in a landslide

112
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,666
in South America.

113
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,041
They pushed the boundaries
of what was known,

114
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,875
and they paid the price.

115
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,750
But that is the only way
to live, Bella.

116
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,916
They sent you to me
to care for you.

117
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,333
Dead?

118
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,750
I'm afraid so, my darling.

119
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,041
Poor Bella.

120
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,583
But love God.

121
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,708
Sleep here.

122
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:51,666
No.

123
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:05,416
Good night, dear Bella.

124
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,500
This, parents.

125
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,625
Peru, yes.

126
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,166
Why you pen book every nut?

127
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,458
I must note down
your nutritional intake.

128
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:27,750
How many?

129
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:29,666
Um...

130
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,833
Tell Bella other places.

131
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,333
That's Lisbon, Portugal.

132
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,208
The south of France. The Alps.

133
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:47,875
Australia.

134
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:51,041
Far away and dangerous,
in both people and animal.

135
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,291
Bella want look at world.

136
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,125
Just...

137
00:13:58,791 --> 00:13:59,916
-Bella.
-Hmm?

138
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:07,166
Bella, I don't think
we're allowed up here.

139
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,250
Let's just...

140
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,416
Bella.

141
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:28,500
-Bella.

142
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
No.

143
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,791
Bella, this is dangerous.

144
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,750
Bella.

145
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,708
-No, Bella.

146
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:16,583
God.

147
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:20,250
Outside must go.

148
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:24,166
Outside? No, we work.

149
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,750
Cut fingers?

150
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,958
Candles take me.
Candles.

151
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,416
Of...
Of course I can. If...

152
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,750
No.

153
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,000
Yes. Out!

154
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,041
Has she ever been outside?

155
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,125
No.

156
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,750
I have created
a perfectly entertaining

157
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:39,375
and safe world for Bella.

158
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,458
Now.

159
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,208
-Bella.
-Now!

160
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,375
-Now!
-Bella.

161
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,750
You know, so many things
outside can kill you, Bella.

162
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:20,833
Kill dead?

163
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:23,208
Snakes, carriages,
sharp-faced birds,

164
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:26,583
earthquakes, inhalation
of toxic grass seeds.

165
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:54,416
Bella.

166
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:56,958
-Bella.

167
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,250
Bella. Look.

168
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,375
-Kill it.
-What?

169
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,666
Why you funny thumbs, God?

170
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,583
Once when I was very small,

171
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,625
my father pinned my thumbs
into a small iron case

172
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:01,916
to see whether he could retard
the growth cycle of bones.

173
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,750
Now, the pain was so great,

174
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,083
to stop myself from weeping,

175
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:11,208
I would stare deeply
into my other fingers,

176
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,041
and simply by observation,

177
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:18,333
begin to parse out
the epidemiological elements.

178
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,708
When he came back,

179
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:24,041
to his surprise,
I was smiling.

180
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:26,958
Good God.

181
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:30,291
He was a man
of unconventional mind.

182
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,583
Time to go.

183
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,500
Uh, a storm approaches.

184
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,875
Why must you scare her so?

185
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,250
She's an experiment,

186
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,166
and I must control
the conditions

187
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,500
or our results
will not be pure. Mm!

188
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,166
Stop!
God, we go!

189
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,291
No, Bella.

190
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,000
Bella want walk in ice cream.

191
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,083
No.

192
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,416
Bella wants!

193
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,791
My face. People scared of God.

194
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:18,875
Laugh at God.

195
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,416
God lovely.

196
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,875
Like dog face.

197
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,000
Woof. Woof, woof!

198
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,416
Quite.

199
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,708
-Stop! Me walk.
-No!

200
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,000
No now? No never?

201
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:34,875
Just no.

202
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,291
Ahhh!

203
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,791
-Bella!
-No!

204
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,583
-No! No! No!
-Hey! Bella!

205
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,208
No!

206
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,791
-Sorry. Sorry.
-No!

207
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,416
-No! No!

208
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,083
I'm sorry, my darling.

209
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:17,791
Mother of God.

210
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,500
What did you do to her?

211
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,416
Why are you hiding her?

212
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:54,083
Tell me what all this means,
or I'll go to the police.

213
00:21:57,083 --> 00:22:00,166
I shall.
For it is a happy tale.

214
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:19,791
It is rare to get a body,

215
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,875
albeit dead,
but so close to life.

216
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:24,583
Rigor had not set in.

217
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:27,208
The body had hardly cooled.

218
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:29,250
No pulse.

219
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:31,250
But some electric currents,

220
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:32,833
so I could have
kept her alive.

221
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:34,291
But you didn't.

222
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,208
I knew nothing of the life
she had abandoned,

223
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:42,208
except she hated it so much
that she had chosen not to be,

224
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:43,375
and forever.

225
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:45,125
What would she feel

226
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:47,125
on being dragged

227
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:50,500
from her carefully chosen
blank eternity

228
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:53,500
and forced to be put
in one of our understaffed,

229
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:57,458
poorly-equipped madhouses,
reformatories or jails?

230
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:00,208
For in this Christian nation,

231
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:03,458
suicide is treated
as lunacy or crime.

232
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:05,958
Who was I to decide her fate?

233
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:10,166
But then there was also,
on my part, a recognition.

234
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:13,333
All my research
had come to this moment.

235
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:16,041
Fate had brought me
a dead body,

236
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:17,291
and a live infant.

237
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:18,583
It was obvious.

238
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:19,666
It was?

239
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,416
Take the infant's brain out

240
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,291
and put it
in the full-grown woman,

241
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:24,791
reanimate her, and watch.

242
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:26,625
Jesus!

243
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,500
She knows?

244
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:21,916
No.

245
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Who was she?

246
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:24,625
No idea.

247
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:28,958
But would you rather
the world did not have Bella?

248
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:09,833
-Mrs. Prim?
-Hmm?

249
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:12,500
Bella discover happy
when she want.

250
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:13,583
Uh-huh.

251
00:27:14,583 --> 00:27:16,791
You are a sour face,
but I fix you.

252
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:19,416
Close eyes.

253
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:22,666
Oh! No!

254
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:24,916
Just wait. It takes a moment.

255
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,416
She grabbed my hairy business.

256
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:29,875
She's sick!

257
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:30,958
Bella.

258
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:33,000
Bella have discover
something I must share.

259
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:34,083
Watch.

260
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:37,083
-What if put cucumber in me?
-No.

261
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:40,375
Bella! Bella!

262
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:43,500
Cease working yourself
immediately.

263
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:44,583
What?

264
00:27:44,666 --> 00:27:47,541
In polite society,
that is not done.

265
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,083
Oh.

266
00:27:50,666 --> 00:27:51,750
Oh.

267
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:54,000
Just do not.

268
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,625
What... is that?

269
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:09,541
My father took out
my oxyntic and pyloric glands,

270
00:28:09,625 --> 00:28:12,208
so I must make
my own gastric juices.

271
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,166
Why in God's name
would he do that?

272
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,666
To discover what no one knew.

273
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,500
Turns out we need them.
Ideally.

274
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,291
Bella,

275
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:24,750
you have not eaten.

276
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:27,708
Do not.

277
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:37,250
Good night.

278
00:28:38,708 --> 00:28:39,708
'Night.

279
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,000
-You know,

280
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:02,125
I'm actually something
of a romantic, Max.

281
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:03,750
What?

282
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:06,500
I believe I see love
between you and Bella.

283
00:29:07,916 --> 00:29:09,458
Uh, I... She is...

284
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:12,083
Perhaps you should marry her.

285
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,375
What?

286
00:29:13,458 --> 00:29:14,750
I think she loves you.

287
00:29:15,583 --> 00:29:16,791
Oh.

288
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:20,458
I've seen people
look at each other with love,

289
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:21,625
as an observer.

290
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:23,875
Not the subject, of course.
I see it.

291
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:26,333
You do?

292
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:28,875
I, um...

293
00:29:29,416 --> 00:29:32,291
I do have feelings for her.

294
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:33,916
So, you would?

295
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:36,916
-Take Bella out.

296
00:29:37,916 --> 00:29:38,958
Bella...

297
00:29:39,416 --> 00:29:40,416
Um...

298
00:29:44,708 --> 00:29:45,708
Feel funny?

299
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:53,166
-Um...
-Do Bella.

300
00:29:59,458 --> 00:30:01,291
I was wondering

301
00:30:01,375 --> 00:30:02,875
if perhaps
you were raising her

302
00:30:02,958 --> 00:30:03,958
to be your mistress.

303
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:06,416
A dark thought unworthy of me,
I know.

304
00:30:07,666 --> 00:30:10,833
So, you are not laying
with her?

305
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:16,250
Spermatic ejaculation can only
induce homeostasis in me

306
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:19,041
if accompanied
by prolonged stimulation

307
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:20,458
of higher nerve centers

308
00:30:20,541 --> 00:30:22,708
whose pressure
on the ductless glands

309
00:30:22,791 --> 00:30:24,500
changes the chemistry
of my blood

310
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:26,750
not for a few
spasmodic minutes,

311
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:28,250
but for many days.

312
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:30,583
What?

313
00:30:30,666 --> 00:30:33,041
I am a eunuch
and can't fuck her.

314
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:36,333
To get a sexual response
from my body

315
00:30:36,416 --> 00:30:38,916
would take the same amount
of electricity

316
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,083
as runs North London.

317
00:30:40,416 --> 00:30:43,541
-Mm-hmm.
-Besides, my paternal feelings

318
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:46,000
seem to outweigh
my sexual thoughts.

319
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:50,375
I apologize
for my own dark thoughts.

320
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:51,666
Not dark at all.

321
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:55,916
Men's, indeed all sexuality,
is basically immoral.

322
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,916
Not all, sir.

323
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,833
Do you wish
to marry her or not?

324
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:04,083
I wish to marry you.
Be my wife.

325
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,416
Let us touch
each other's genital pieces.

326
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,083
Uh... No. No.

327
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,291
I do not wish
to take advantage of you.

328
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:19,583
You are special.

329
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,416
When we are wed.

330
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:29,416
One condition.

331
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,250
She must desire it also,
I understand.

332
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:33,916
Two conditions, then.

333
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,291
That one you said,

334
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:39,250
and you must live here
with me, always.

335
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:43,250
I will have
a legal agreement drawn up.

336
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:52,833
Hmm.

337
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:10,750
Curious contract.

338
00:32:10,833 --> 00:32:12,875
There are several
spelling errors.

339
00:32:12,958 --> 00:32:15,875
Oh. Immaterial to
the legal bindingness of it,

340
00:32:15,958 --> 00:32:17,083
I assure you.

341
00:32:18,833 --> 00:32:23,000
Must be quite a woman
to warrant such binding.

342
00:32:27,833 --> 00:32:30,000
If you'll excuse me,
I need to use the facilities.

343
00:32:31,791 --> 00:32:34,458
Are you five years old that
you can't hold your water?

344
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:35,958
Weak bladder, sir.

345
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:39,125
Like my father before me
and his before him.

346
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:41,708
You may have prostate cancer.
Look into it.

347
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,500
Will do.

348
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:52,500
Ms. Bella Baxter, as per
your contract, no doubt.

349
00:33:53,291 --> 00:33:55,250
Good afternoon, visiting man.

350
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:57,291
Want my hat?

351
00:33:58,125 --> 00:33:59,416
Would it suit me?

352
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:01,750
-Yes.

353
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:04,083
It is foolish good.

354
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:06,250
I had to meet this woman
who would inspire

355
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:09,166
such a contract of marriage
that imprisons her.

356
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:11,333
What you mean?

357
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:12,458
You shall live here,

358
00:34:12,541 --> 00:34:15,916
travel with Mr. Max McCandles
and Baxter abroad,

359
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,875
but not go forth in the city.

360
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:19,708
I see.

361
00:34:20,833 --> 00:34:22,125
They love me tight.

362
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:23,750
I understand why.

363
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:26,041
I have to pinch you,
to see if you are real.

364
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:27,750
You will not... Ah.

365
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:32,000
Who is you?

366
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:36,750
Mr. Duncan Wedderburn.

367
00:35:07,458 --> 00:35:08,458
Open.

368
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,375
How you get up here?

369
00:35:20,791 --> 00:35:22,416
Shh.

370
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,500
I climbed.

371
00:35:42,416 --> 00:35:43,833
You were watch me long?

372
00:35:43,916 --> 00:35:45,291
Not long.

373
00:35:45,375 --> 00:35:47,208
You did not see me
working on myself

374
00:35:47,291 --> 00:35:48,833
to get happiness, did you?

375
00:35:49,916 --> 00:35:51,958
It is not polites, I know.

376
00:35:57,125 --> 00:35:59,416
Do not care
for polite society.

377
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,625
It's fucking boring.

378
00:36:01,416 --> 00:36:02,750
Destroys one's soul.

379
00:36:03,875 --> 00:36:05,375
God not believe in soul.

380
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:10,041
I think God's the actual
author of the soul idea.

381
00:36:10,541 --> 00:36:12,083
Godwin Baxter?

382
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,083
That burnt dog.

383
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:15,750
What is that story?

384
00:36:16,583 --> 00:36:19,166
You are a prisoner
and I aim to free you.

385
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:24,166
Something in you,
some hungry being,

386
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:27,083
hungry for experience,
freedom, touch.

387
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:29,250
To see the unknown
and know it.

388
00:36:30,041 --> 00:36:32,375
So, why am I here, you ask?

389
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:36,541
I'm going to Lisbon on Friday.
I'd like you to come.

390
00:36:36,625 --> 00:36:38,416
Lisbon of Portugal?

391
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,583
That is the Lisbon I speak of.

392
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,500
God never allow it.

393
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,708
That's why I'm not asking him.

394
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:50,583
I'm asking you.

395
00:36:52,791 --> 00:36:55,041
Bella not safe with you,
I think.

396
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:58,291
You are absolutely... not.

397
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:16,791
May I have a moment
of value time, dear God?

398
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:18,250
Of course, Bella.

399
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:21,000
I wanted to tell you big news.

400
00:37:21,083 --> 00:37:23,166
Bella is dizzy with excite.

401
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:24,583
What is it?

402
00:37:24,666 --> 00:37:26,416
Tonight, at midnight,

403
00:37:27,166 --> 00:37:30,791
I secretly run away
with one Duncan Wedderburn.

404
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:31,916
What?

405
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,375
You will wish to stop me.

406
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:34,500
I shall stop you.

407
00:37:34,583 --> 00:37:36,458
You hold Bella too tight.

408
00:37:37,166 --> 00:37:38,958
I must set forth into waters.

409
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:40,083
We can travel.

410
00:37:40,166 --> 00:37:43,083
You, me, and Max whom,
I will remind you,

411
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:44,500
you are betrothed to.

412
00:37:44,583 --> 00:37:46,375
I will marry Max,

413
00:37:46,458 --> 00:37:48,958
as he seems right for that,

414
00:37:49,041 --> 00:37:52,833
but first, I shall adventure
on Duncan Wedderburn

415
00:37:52,916 --> 00:37:56,666
who, I think,
cares little of damage to me,

416
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:00,291
but will be interesting
as well.

417
00:38:00,375 --> 00:38:01,958
I can't let you go.

418
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:10,791
Kiss me and set me forth.

419
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:12,750
If you do not,

420
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,166
Bella's insides
shall turn rotten with hate.

421
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,541
-Hate?
-Hate.

422
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:30,000
Unpack those bags, Prim.

423
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:32,041
Godwin has told me your plan.

424
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:33,333
I do not blame you, Bella.

425
00:38:33,416 --> 00:38:35,250
That man is a cad and a rake.

426
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:36,375
He has insidious ways

427
00:38:36,458 --> 00:38:38,291
of getting under
a naive woman's skin.

428
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:40,791
It is mostly his eyes on mine.

429
00:38:40,875 --> 00:38:43,625
And his hands
when between Bella's legs

430
00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:46,291
and whisper words I can't hear

431
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:48,375
but heat in my body.

432
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:49,916
Jesus, Bella.

433
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,375
We are engaged.
I love you.

434
00:38:52,458 --> 00:38:54,625
And when I return,
we marriage,

435
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:56,875
and be happy
as two doves on a branch.

436
00:38:56,958 --> 00:38:58,708
-You think I need travel hat?
-No!

437
00:38:59,291 --> 00:39:00,291
This will not do.

438
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:02,291
It cannot!

439
00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:03,666
I'll see to this man myself.

440
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:05,916
I will beat his handsome face

441
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,291
into a porridge
of blood and bones!

442
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:10,166
Max, you are flushed,

443
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,583
and I am too
at sight of different Max.

444
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:14,708
I apologize,
but I will not let a man

445
00:39:14,791 --> 00:39:17,083
that I know has nothing
but ill intent in his mind

446
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:19,791
and nothing for you
in his heart trick you.

447
00:39:19,875 --> 00:39:22,666
I will smash
his fucking head in.

448
00:39:29,583 --> 00:39:30,583
Mm.

449
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:39,458
Bella? It...

450
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:44,750
Bella.

451
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:55,333
Goodbye, later dove.

452
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,083
I will see you
after grand adventure.

453
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:01,208
God?

454
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:42,833
She's gone.

455
00:40:43,833 --> 00:40:46,333
I am having port
for breakfast.

456
00:40:46,791 --> 00:40:48,458
It is strangely delicious.

457
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:50,291
Why did you not stop her?

458
00:40:51,291 --> 00:40:53,458
She is a being of free will.

459
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,958
She's now out there. Alone.

460
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:02,000
She will be fine.

461
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:04,041
I'm a fool.
I should have stopped her.

462
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:06,166
We are men of science.

463
00:41:07,208 --> 00:41:10,791
This emotionality is unseemly.

464
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:15,875
I just hope she's all right.

465
00:41:38,208 --> 00:41:39,500
You are
the most beautiful woman

466
00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:40,583
I've ever seen.

467
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:43,166
I will not lie,
I have been with many.

468
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:45,166
Mrs. Prim said you were wolf

469
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:47,041
with scent
of hundred women on you.

470
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:48,541
She undersells it.

471
00:41:49,166 --> 00:41:51,750
Okay. Oysters.

472
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:53,416
Have you had them before?

473
00:41:53,666 --> 00:41:54,708
I have not.

474
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:01,041
Shuck, chuck and bubble.

475
00:42:03,583 --> 00:42:04,583
Mm.

476
00:42:06,541 --> 00:42:07,541
Mm.

477
00:42:11,666 --> 00:42:12,958
Rollicking.

478
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:17,708
Rollicking.

479
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:22,625
Wait. Bella.

480
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,041
So, nuns and monks

481
00:42:33,125 --> 00:42:35,041
would starch their clothes
with egg whites

482
00:42:35,125 --> 00:42:37,291
and, with the yolks,
make these tarts.

483
00:42:37,916 --> 00:42:39,083
Now, how to eat them?

484
00:42:39,166 --> 00:42:40,875
I will guess
through the mouth.

485
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:44,000
They must not be eaten
dainty flake by dainty flake,

486
00:42:44,083 --> 00:42:46,916
but inhaled with gusto,
like life itself.

487
00:42:53,458 --> 00:42:54,833
Incredible.

488
00:42:55,791 --> 00:42:57,750
Who made these?
We need more.

489
00:42:57,833 --> 00:43:00,375
No more. One's enough.
Any more is too much.

490
00:43:01,375 --> 00:43:02,708
It's siesta time.

491
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,416
What is siesta?

492
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:33,875
Why do people not just do this

493
00:43:33,958 --> 00:43:35,250
all the time?

494
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,125
Well, at the risk
of being immodest,

495
00:43:39,208 --> 00:43:42,166
you've just been thrice fucked
by the very best.

496
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:43,375
It's probable no other man

497
00:43:43,458 --> 00:43:45,041
would ever bring you
to the raptures I have.

498
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:47,958
I feel bad for you.

499
00:43:49,541 --> 00:43:53,000
Well, then it will just be you
I do furious jumping with.

500
00:43:53,083 --> 00:43:55,416
Furious jumping?

501
00:43:56,083 --> 00:43:57,166
I love that.

502
00:43:57,583 --> 00:43:59,000
I'm rested.

503
00:43:59,791 --> 00:44:00,916
Let us go again.

504
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,125
Again?

505
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:04,458
Unfortunately,

506
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:06,166
even I have my limits.

507
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:08,541
Men cannot keep coming back
for more.

508
00:44:08,625 --> 00:44:10,916
It is a physiological problem?

509
00:44:11,666 --> 00:44:13,125
A weakness in men?

510
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:15,500
Mm... Well...

511
00:44:17,833 --> 00:44:19,291
Perhaps so.

512
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:22,875
You'd be advised,
if it's not too late,

513
00:44:22,958 --> 00:44:24,708
not to fall in love with me.

514
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,916
I have very little to offer

515
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,833
in the way of constancy.

516
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,125
Just adventure.

517
00:44:30,208 --> 00:44:31,375
I see.

518
00:44:32,916 --> 00:44:34,041
Let us sleep.

519
00:45:02,791 --> 00:45:03,791
Taxi, madam?

520
00:48:44,458 --> 00:48:45,458
Good evening...

521
00:48:47,208 --> 00:48:48,208
Duncan Wedderburn.

522
00:48:48,708 --> 00:48:50,750
Bella, where were you?
You disappeared.

523
00:48:51,458 --> 00:48:52,666
I did not.

524
00:48:53,416 --> 00:48:55,375
Nobody can just disappear.

525
00:48:55,916 --> 00:48:56,916
What?

526
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,708
Can they? Disappear?

527
00:48:58,791 --> 00:48:59,916
No, of course not.

528
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,791
What the fuck
are you talking...

529
00:49:01,875 --> 00:49:02,875
Where were you?

530
00:49:03,208 --> 00:49:06,791
I wanted a tart and then
an adventure befell me.

531
00:49:06,875 --> 00:49:09,791
I did not know how to return
and then I heard it.

532
00:49:09,875 --> 00:49:10,875
The tram.

533
00:49:10,958 --> 00:49:13,708
I will walk to the noise,
and I found it.

534
00:49:14,041 --> 00:49:15,458
Amazement to Bella.

535
00:49:15,541 --> 00:49:17,000
Explorer bloods in me.

536
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:19,083
Bella, it's dangerous
to go out without me.

537
00:49:19,166 --> 00:49:20,166
I have adventured it

538
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:22,541
and found nothing
but sugar and violence.

539
00:49:22,625 --> 00:49:24,208
It is most charming.

540
00:49:24,291 --> 00:49:25,375
I am fine.

541
00:49:26,041 --> 00:49:28,625
Now, I must lie down and
you must lie down on top of me

542
00:49:28,708 --> 00:49:30,041
and do more furious jumping.

543
00:49:34,166 --> 00:49:35,166
Kitty.

544
00:49:36,166 --> 00:49:38,625
Did you see the new show
in London by Wilde?

545
00:49:38,708 --> 00:49:40,000
Marvelously witty.

546
00:49:40,083 --> 00:49:41,375
I loved it.

547
00:49:41,458 --> 00:49:42,958
"A handbag."

548
00:49:47,625 --> 00:49:48,625
Bella.

549
00:49:49,958 --> 00:49:50,958
What?

550
00:49:52,291 --> 00:49:54,625
Why I keep it in my mouth
if it is revolting?

551
00:49:55,791 --> 00:49:57,875
I have said that before
to Gerald.

552
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:02,250
-If you catch my drift.
-Uh...

553
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,333
You are wicked.

554
00:50:04,416 --> 00:50:06,458
Oh. Because
you mean his penis.

555
00:50:08,833 --> 00:50:10,708
Duncan's can sometimes
be salty.

556
00:50:14,625 --> 00:50:15,666
Good God, Bella.

557
00:50:17,708 --> 00:50:19,250
I must go punch that baby.

558
00:50:23,958 --> 00:50:25,083
Bella.

559
00:50:29,708 --> 00:50:32,083
Your behavior
is unconscionable.

560
00:50:32,166 --> 00:50:33,375
Will you behave?

561
00:50:33,458 --> 00:50:35,708
The food
was cacking my throat,

562
00:50:35,791 --> 00:50:37,375
the baby annoying,

563
00:50:37,458 --> 00:50:39,708
and the woman
boring with words.

564
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,125
You will rejoin the table

565
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:44,000
and will confine yourself to
the following three phrases,

566
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:46,416
"How marvelous!", "Delighted"

567
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:50,125
and "How did they make
the pastry so crisp?" Yes?

568
00:50:50,791 --> 00:50:52,333
You are hurting Bella.

569
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:53,750
Sorry.

570
00:50:53,833 --> 00:50:55,666
Reason does not penetrate.

571
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:56,750
Let us go.

572
00:51:01,208 --> 00:51:02,208
Ow.

573
00:51:14,333 --> 00:51:16,833
Are you enjoying Lisbon,
Bella?

574
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:19,875
Delighted.

575
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:24,500
Kitty, how is
your dear father?

576
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
He's very unwell.

577
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:28,458
I fear he will not see
the year out.

578
00:51:28,541 --> 00:51:29,958
-Oh.
-How marvelous.

579
00:51:30,583 --> 00:51:32,541
How did they get
the pastry so crisp?

580
00:51:51,583 --> 00:51:52,750
Good God.

581
00:51:53,583 --> 00:51:54,666
What is it?

582
00:51:55,791 --> 00:51:56,875
From her.

583
00:52:00,208 --> 00:52:02,625
"Me good. Lisbon.

584
00:52:03,125 --> 00:52:06,083
"Sugar tart lick me all day."

585
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,583
At least I hope that's
all one sentence, anyway.

586
00:52:09,666 --> 00:52:10,916
-Do you think they're...
-Fucking?

587
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Yes.

588
00:52:13,625 --> 00:52:14,833
Also,

589
00:52:14,916 --> 00:52:16,291
fellating a tram.

590
00:53:29,041 --> 00:53:32,375
Does your head ache too,
Duncan Wedderburn?

591
00:53:32,458 --> 00:53:35,000
And I also am starving
for dinner.

592
00:53:35,083 --> 00:53:36,666
Where the fuck were you?

593
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,791
Victoria Blessington?

594
00:53:43,291 --> 00:53:45,166
I haven't seen you for years.

595
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:47,083
And you still have not,

596
00:53:47,166 --> 00:53:49,708
as I am Bella Baxter,

597
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:51,500
strange feathered lady.

598
00:53:51,583 --> 00:53:54,416
I apologize.
I could've sworn you were she.

599
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:56,750
Hmm.

600
00:53:59,416 --> 00:54:00,500
Right.

601
00:54:00,583 --> 00:54:01,791
Shall we?

602
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,291
-The steak, the fish,

603
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:07,583
little caramel things in pots

604
00:54:07,666 --> 00:54:10,166
that old spotted people
over there have.

605
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:11,916
I don't want caramel in pots.

606
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:14,500
Of course not.
That was all for Bella.

607
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,125
Order at your whim.

608
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:20,708
You are cross at Bella's
outings and adventures.

609
00:54:20,791 --> 00:54:23,041
And yet
we must discover by whim,

610
00:54:23,125 --> 00:54:26,125
as spoken by Duncan Wedderburn
to Bella Baxter,

611
00:54:26,208 --> 00:54:27,708
day one of Lisbon love affair.

612
00:54:28,291 --> 00:54:29,291
Touché.

613
00:54:29,583 --> 00:54:31,708
Understand me never lived
outside God's house.

614
00:54:31,791 --> 00:54:32,791
What?

615
00:54:32,875 --> 00:54:35,250
So, Bella so much to discover,

616
00:54:35,333 --> 00:54:37,500
and your sad face

617
00:54:37,958 --> 00:54:40,958
makes me discover
angry feelings for you.

618
00:54:42,708 --> 00:54:43,708
Right.

619
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:47,041
I have become
the very thing I hate,

620
00:54:47,125 --> 00:54:49,458
a grasping succubus
of a lover.

621
00:54:51,208 --> 00:54:53,541
I've pried many of them off me
and now I'm it.

622
00:54:54,083 --> 00:54:55,083
Fuck!

623
00:56:02,416 --> 00:56:05,458
You, like me, are a creature
of freedom in the moments.

624
00:56:08,458 --> 00:56:09,708
What do you keep
doing that for?

625
00:56:10,791 --> 00:56:13,041
A man over there
repeated blinks at me.

626
00:56:13,875 --> 00:56:15,250
I blink back.

627
00:56:15,333 --> 00:56:16,833
For polites, I think.

628
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,708
We are going to dance in town.
Please join us.

629
00:56:32,041 --> 00:56:33,958
I have never danced in town.

630
00:56:46,625 --> 00:56:48,250
Duncan!
Can't!

631
00:57:02,333 --> 00:57:03,333
You're quite mad.

632
00:57:03,416 --> 00:57:06,416
Stop talking as your sounds
make Bella angry!

633
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:07,791
I will not stop talking.

634
00:57:07,875 --> 00:57:09,000
If I have something
to say, I'll...

635
00:57:09,083 --> 00:57:11,000
Ouch.

636
00:57:17,916 --> 00:57:18,916
All right.

637
00:57:22,625 --> 00:57:23,625
What's this?

638
00:57:25,083 --> 00:57:26,083
Oh.

639
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,375
A man was teaching me chess,

640
00:57:29,458 --> 00:57:31,541
and he said he thought
I would probably have

641
00:57:31,625 --> 00:57:34,166
the softest skin
he had ever touched.

642
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:36,000
And I said, if I did,

643
00:57:36,083 --> 00:57:38,750
it would be
the inner thighs to test,

644
00:57:38,833 --> 00:57:42,083
as that is where the epidermis
is at its most fine.

645
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:43,250
So we tested,

646
00:57:43,666 --> 00:57:45,500
and it was the softest ever.

647
00:57:46,291 --> 00:57:49,583
I wondered if perhaps they're
not equal in softitude.

648
00:57:49,916 --> 00:57:51,291
Indeed they were not.

649
00:57:51,375 --> 00:57:54,875
So I made sure to note it,
remembering which was which.

650
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:04,000
What of the tongue play
you were about to perform?

651
00:58:07,958 --> 00:58:09,541
Is that not happening?

652
00:58:27,708 --> 00:58:28,750
You...

653
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:32,541
You are troubled.

654
00:58:34,083 --> 00:58:35,291
Did he lie with you?

655
00:58:36,125 --> 00:58:37,791
No, we were against a wall.

656
00:58:38,791 --> 00:58:40,250
Did you furious jump him?

657
00:58:40,333 --> 00:58:41,458
-No...

658
00:58:41,541 --> 00:58:43,833
...he just fast-licked
my clitoris.

659
00:58:43,916 --> 00:58:45,791
I had the heat
that needed release,

660
00:58:45,875 --> 00:58:47,666
so at my request, it was.

661
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,250
You, too, may tongue play me,

662
00:58:53,333 --> 00:58:58,166
so I'm not understanding
this complicated feeling.

663
00:59:01,416 --> 00:59:02,958
Are you now crying?

664
00:59:11,458 --> 00:59:15,375
What a confusing person
you are, Duncan Wedderburn.

665
00:59:15,458 --> 00:59:16,875
A liver.

666
00:59:25,333 --> 00:59:29,125
Mm. A small incision

667
00:59:29,708 --> 00:59:32,875
is all that is needed.

668
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:48,750
I was chloroforming goats
all morning.

669
00:59:48,833 --> 00:59:51,416
I may have ingested too much.

670
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,500
I am going to venture
to suggest

671
00:59:53,583 --> 00:59:56,416
you are upset
by Bella's absence.

672
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,208
The liters of port,

673
00:59:58,291 --> 00:59:59,875
the sobbing I hear at night.

674
00:59:59,958 --> 01:00:03,000
Good God, man!
You prattle like an imbecile.

675
01:00:03,083 --> 01:00:04,416
She is gone!

676
01:00:05,791 --> 01:00:07,708
I am a man of science.

677
01:00:07,791 --> 01:00:11,000
I just need to engage in,
and continue, the project.

678
01:00:11,083 --> 01:00:14,166
That is all. I must go on
to the next thing.

679
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:16,625
Our feelings
must be put aside.

680
01:00:17,458 --> 01:00:20,333
Do you think my father
could have branded me

681
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:23,166
with hot irons on the genitals
the way he did

682
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:26,291
if he could not put
science and progress first?

683
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:27,375
Branded you?

684
01:00:29,916 --> 01:00:32,083
Let us find a body.

685
01:00:33,416 --> 01:00:34,666
A... A what?

686
01:00:57,833 --> 01:00:59,000
Hello. Good morning.

687
01:01:01,666 --> 01:01:03,125
Good morning, darling.

688
01:01:07,541 --> 01:01:10,750
I haven't been very supportive
of your adventurous spirit.

689
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:12,541
So I have a surprise for you.

690
01:01:21,083 --> 01:01:22,083
Get in.

691
01:01:36,458 --> 01:01:39,375
-We changed hotels?
-Look out the window, Bella.

692
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:53,000
-We're on boat?
-Indeed.

693
01:01:54,208 --> 01:01:55,666
You aim to trap Bella at sea.

694
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:58,458
I aim to give you
a new adventure.

695
01:01:58,541 --> 01:02:01,208
I suppose it's true
you'll be easier to find.

696
01:02:01,291 --> 01:02:03,833
Come, disrobe me.

697
01:02:03,916 --> 01:02:04,958
Ride me.

698
01:02:05,875 --> 01:02:08,333
And we'll then have
cocktails on foredeck.

699
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:28,291
Bella.

700
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:33,791
Bella.

701
01:02:37,041 --> 01:02:38,875
-Bella.

702
01:02:39,791 --> 01:02:40,916
-Bella!

703
01:02:41,875 --> 01:02:44,375
Blue. Blue. Blue.

704
01:04:23,583 --> 01:04:25,333
-Shit on me?

705
01:04:25,416 --> 01:04:26,833
-Fucker!

706
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:31,750
Madam.

707
01:04:33,541 --> 01:04:35,041
When do we stop?

708
01:04:36,583 --> 01:04:38,416
Athens. Three days.

709
01:05:06,625 --> 01:05:08,625
That woman's on fire, look.

710
01:05:11,958 --> 01:05:13,125
I know you're upset with me.

711
01:05:13,208 --> 01:05:16,125
Forgive my kidnapping of you,
but it was for love.

712
01:05:16,208 --> 01:05:18,541
A romantic jape.
Don't be such a cunt about it.

713
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:22,041
-I want a drink.
-Of course, my darling.

714
01:05:22,125 --> 01:05:25,375
The ship is fun,
a whole world to explore.

715
01:05:26,291 --> 01:05:28,083
Do you love me? I love you.

716
01:05:29,291 --> 01:05:31,458
Describe the elements
I should be looking for

717
01:05:31,541 --> 01:05:33,375
within myself to be sure.

718
01:05:34,583 --> 01:05:35,958
You just feel it or not.

719
01:05:36,041 --> 01:05:39,666
So it is no evidence base,
as God would say.

720
01:05:40,416 --> 01:05:41,958
So how judge it empirically?

721
01:05:42,041 --> 01:05:44,208
What the fuck are you
talking about? Who are you?

722
01:05:44,291 --> 01:05:45,833
You don't know
what bananas are,

723
01:05:45,916 --> 01:05:47,041
you've never heard of chess,

724
01:05:47,125 --> 01:05:48,833
and yet you know
what "empirically" means.

725
01:05:48,916 --> 01:05:51,583
Bella wants a drink.
I said twice now.

726
01:05:51,666 --> 01:05:54,208
I've never felt
anything like this.

727
01:05:54,291 --> 01:05:55,708
Is this true for you?

728
01:05:57,791 --> 01:05:59,458
I suppose, empirically it is.

729
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,958
I'm out of ink.

730
01:06:05,291 --> 01:06:06,291
Oh.

731
01:06:09,875 --> 01:06:11,375
Then ink you shall have,
my love.

732
01:06:24,541 --> 01:06:27,125
Hello,
interesting older lady.

733
01:06:27,208 --> 01:06:28,875
I must touch your hair.

734
01:06:31,291 --> 01:06:33,041
I also noticed your hair.

735
01:06:33,125 --> 01:06:37,166
Just like silk on
a translucent, glowing egg.

736
01:06:37,666 --> 01:06:40,208
That is fancy words
that excite me somehow.

737
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:43,166
I saw you're with
handsome over there.

738
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:45,500
White teeth and a hard cock.

739
01:06:46,708 --> 01:06:48,125
Duncan Wedderburn.

740
01:06:48,208 --> 01:06:51,625
His teeth are also hard.
His penis is also white.

741
01:06:51,708 --> 01:06:53,666
-Good lay, I hope.
-He is my only.

742
01:06:54,041 --> 01:06:56,875
But I find him to elicit
exceptional sensations

743
01:06:56,958 --> 01:07:00,583
throughout my whole body
that leave me yelping happily.

744
01:07:00,666 --> 01:07:04,583
I also wish to dash his body,
form, cadaver, into the sea.

745
01:07:05,208 --> 01:07:06,500
Is this man
jumping on your body?

746
01:07:06,583 --> 01:07:08,416
-No, he is not.

747
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:10,583
I haven't been bedded
in 20 years.

748
01:07:10,666 --> 01:07:11,750
What?

749
01:07:12,416 --> 01:07:13,541
That is terrible.

750
01:07:13,625 --> 01:07:15,583
It doesn't concern me greatly.

751
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:17,833
As years have passed,

752
01:07:17,916 --> 01:07:20,541
what's in between my ears
is my big concern.

753
01:07:21,125 --> 01:07:23,083
What's in between my legs...

754
01:07:24,583 --> 01:07:25,666
much less so.

755
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:28,083
A desperate rationalization,
Martha.

756
01:07:28,458 --> 01:07:30,416
Oh, this is Harry Astley.

757
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:33,666
Don't take what he says
too much to heart.

758
01:07:34,125 --> 01:07:35,250
He's a cynic.

759
01:07:35,833 --> 01:07:36,916
Madam.

760
01:07:37,416 --> 01:07:39,000
I am Bella Baxter.

761
01:07:39,958 --> 01:07:42,458
I do not know
what this "cynic" is.

762
01:07:42,541 --> 01:07:43,875
Bella.

763
01:07:43,958 --> 01:07:44,958
Ink.

764
01:07:45,041 --> 01:07:49,125
Duncan Wedderburn, I have made
friends, colleagues, comrades.

765
01:07:49,208 --> 01:07:50,750
Harry Astley.

766
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:52,416
This is Martha.

767
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:55,708
She is my new friend who has
not been fucked in 20 years.

768
01:07:55,791 --> 01:07:57,458
Is that not astonishment?

769
01:07:57,541 --> 01:07:59,666
I hope you use your hand
between your legs

770
01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:01,291
-to keep yourself happy.

771
01:08:01,375 --> 01:08:04,833
Good God, Bella,
you cannot speak like this.

772
01:08:04,916 --> 01:08:07,000
Polites of society. I forgot.

773
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,583
Polite society

774
01:08:08,666 --> 01:08:11,083
-will destroy you.
-It will?

775
01:08:11,166 --> 01:08:12,541
Yeah, there...
there's some truth to that.

776
01:08:12,625 --> 01:08:14,458
We all agreed on that.

777
01:08:14,541 --> 01:08:16,916
As to your enquiry on my hand.

778
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,916
Occasionally, yes.

779
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,375
That is much reassuring news.

780
01:08:22,208 --> 01:08:24,708
-We shall all dine together.
-Well, actually...

781
01:08:25,208 --> 01:08:27,500
We are all on a ship
and cannot escape,

782
01:08:27,583 --> 01:08:30,666
and there is a world to enjoy,
traverse, circumnavigate.

783
01:08:31,583 --> 01:08:33,708
Or can she not have friends,
Mr. Wedderburn?

784
01:08:34,333 --> 01:08:35,958
Delighted.

785
01:08:39,083 --> 01:08:40,375
Marry me.

786
01:08:40,458 --> 01:08:41,458
What?

787
01:08:41,541 --> 01:08:42,916
I meant to throw you aside.

788
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,666
A few months and send you
packing, but I cannot.

789
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:46,750
Say you'll marry me.

790
01:08:46,833 --> 01:08:48,708
No one's ever captured
my heart. You have.

791
01:08:49,833 --> 01:08:51,125
It is tricky,

792
01:08:51,208 --> 01:08:53,666
as I am engaged
to Mr. Max McCandles.

793
01:08:54,958 --> 01:08:55,958
What?

794
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:59,000
My hand has taken by another.

795
01:08:59,708 --> 01:09:02,625
It is a saying I heard,
but did not understand.

796
01:09:02,708 --> 01:09:06,041
You do not take just the hand,
but all, do you not?

797
01:09:06,125 --> 01:09:08,791
You ran away with me from him.

798
01:09:08,875 --> 01:09:10,000
A recounting of events,

799
01:09:10,083 --> 01:09:12,166
the point of which
is elusive to me.

800
01:09:12,250 --> 01:09:13,583
You chose me over him.

801
01:09:13,875 --> 01:09:15,333
For now.

802
01:09:15,416 --> 01:09:16,541
For fun.

803
01:09:16,625 --> 01:09:19,375
I'll fucking throw you
overboard!

804
01:09:19,458 --> 01:09:22,416
So you wish to marry me
or kill me?

805
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:25,250
-Is that the proposal?
-No.

806
01:09:41,291 --> 01:09:42,708
Going to the casino.

807
01:09:53,583 --> 01:09:55,166
Uh, that's fine.

808
01:09:55,916 --> 01:09:57,125
She is coming along.

809
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:58,875
Let's try again.

810
01:09:59,375 --> 01:10:02,916
Gross motor skills
will develop slowly,

811
01:10:03,375 --> 01:10:05,791
but you will progress fast.

812
01:10:07,791 --> 01:10:08,833
Felicity.

813
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Not that fast.

814
01:10:25,833 --> 01:10:27,791
I am reading Emerson.

815
01:10:27,875 --> 01:10:30,250
He speaks about
the improvement of men.

816
01:10:30,333 --> 01:10:33,541
I do not know why he does
not give advice to women.

817
01:10:33,625 --> 01:10:35,291
Perhaps he does not know any.

818
01:10:36,333 --> 01:10:39,125
Try and read Goethe.

819
01:10:39,208 --> 01:10:41,833
Philosophy is a waste of time,
Bella.

820
01:10:41,916 --> 01:10:44,208
Really? Say more.

821
01:10:44,291 --> 01:10:46,250
No, no, Harry, you wretch.

822
01:10:46,333 --> 01:10:47,333
It is integral.

823
01:10:48,375 --> 01:10:51,458
People and society
can be improved.

824
01:10:52,458 --> 01:10:54,458
It is the goal of all
to improve,

825
01:10:54,541 --> 01:10:56,291
advance, progress, grow.

826
01:10:57,208 --> 01:10:58,208
I know this in me,

827
01:10:58,291 --> 01:10:59,958
and I am sure
I am indicative of all.

828
01:11:00,041 --> 01:11:04,083
Trust me, you are definitely
unique, Bella, in all ways.

829
01:11:04,166 --> 01:11:07,833
But this improvement
through philosophy

830
01:11:07,916 --> 01:11:09,250
is people trying to run away

831
01:11:09,333 --> 01:11:12,000
from the fact
that we are all cruel beasts.

832
01:11:12,083 --> 01:11:14,458
Born that way, die that way.

833
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:17,291
It is a dark view of things,
Harry.

834
01:11:17,625 --> 01:11:18,625
Bella...

835
01:11:19,916 --> 01:11:21,375
let us take the air...

836
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:24,541
in our cabin.

837
01:11:25,166 --> 01:11:26,333
But these two are fighting,

838
01:11:26,416 --> 01:11:29,291
and ideas are banging around
in Bella's head and heart

839
01:11:29,375 --> 01:11:31,041
like lights in a storm.

840
01:11:31,125 --> 01:11:32,375
Oh.

841
01:11:33,666 --> 01:11:36,083
You're always
reading now, Bella.

842
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:40,208
You're losing some of
your adorable way of speaking.

843
01:11:40,291 --> 01:11:41,958
I am
a changingable feast,

844
01:11:42,041 --> 01:11:43,416
as are all of we.

845
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,250
Apparently
according to Emerson,

846
01:11:45,333 --> 01:11:46,416
disagreed with by Harry.

847
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:47,875
Come, come. Just come.

848
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:51,166
You are in my sun.

849
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:52,791
What?

850
01:12:31,541 --> 01:12:32,541
Come.

851
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:36,041
Mm-mm. Busy drinking heavily.

852
01:12:39,875 --> 01:12:41,875
Busy losing heavily.

853
01:13:21,125 --> 01:13:22,708
I must go meet Martha.

854
01:13:24,458 --> 01:13:25,708
Martha.

855
01:13:26,666 --> 01:13:28,208
She is the problem.

856
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:32,458
I'll throw that perfumed bag
of flesh overboard.

857
01:13:33,541 --> 01:13:34,666
I dare you.

858
01:13:45,083 --> 01:13:46,541
Martha!

859
01:13:47,666 --> 01:13:49,083
Where is she?

860
01:13:49,166 --> 01:13:50,750
Where are you, fuck.

861
01:13:50,833 --> 01:13:52,291
Where is she?

862
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:56,208
-Where are you going?
-She's going over the side.

863
01:13:56,291 --> 01:13:57,500
Oh, marvelous!

864
01:13:57,583 --> 01:13:59,750
I never imagined
being murdered.

865
01:13:59,833 --> 01:14:00,833
How dramatic.

866
01:14:01,416 --> 01:14:02,708
Well, she seems happy to die.

867
01:14:02,791 --> 01:14:04,208
I'm sorry
for getting in your way.

868
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:06,750
- Oh!

869
01:14:06,833 --> 01:14:08,458
Oh!

870
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:11,458
Exciting.

871
01:14:12,875 --> 01:14:15,291
Oh... Whoa, whoa, whoa...

872
01:14:15,375 --> 01:14:17,541
Oh! Ooh, ooh.

873
01:14:18,791 --> 01:14:21,583
-Oh. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa...

874
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,583
-Hyah.

875
01:14:29,291 --> 01:14:30,791
I'll be in the bar.

876
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:07,208
You have
made me think, cogitate,

877
01:15:08,083 --> 01:15:10,958
perambulate on ideas
that are wrong,

878
01:15:11,041 --> 01:15:14,250
erroneous
and nonsensically annoying

879
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:16,208
that lead me not to sleep.

880
01:15:16,291 --> 01:15:17,416
So...

881
01:15:19,291 --> 01:15:21,500
You say all are cruel.

882
01:15:21,583 --> 01:15:24,208
And I disagree, disavow,

883
01:15:24,291 --> 01:15:25,375
and say no not.

884
01:15:26,625 --> 01:15:28,708
But when with Duncan,

885
01:15:28,791 --> 01:15:31,333
the cruel
just bubbles up in me.

886
01:15:31,750 --> 01:15:33,250
That shows good judgment.

887
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:35,708
He is a pretty moron.

888
01:15:35,791 --> 01:15:36,875
No.

889
01:15:37,541 --> 01:15:39,166
I do not wish to be cruel.

890
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:42,958
I must improve
this aspect of myself.

891
01:15:43,041 --> 01:15:44,708
You don't know the world.

892
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:46,375
And you fear it.

893
01:15:48,791 --> 01:15:50,375
I do not fear it.

894
01:15:50,791 --> 01:15:52,958
Do you want to see
what the world is really like?

895
01:15:53,416 --> 01:15:54,416
I'll show you.

896
01:15:55,125 --> 01:15:56,125
Yes.

897
01:15:56,791 --> 01:15:57,791
Of course.

898
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:45,666
Do you hear that?

899
01:16:49,291 --> 01:16:50,291
What is it?

900
01:17:11,708 --> 01:17:13,625
-Lot of dead babies.
-Oh.

901
01:17:14,208 --> 01:17:15,416
Must be hot.

902
01:17:17,166 --> 01:17:18,583
We must go help them.

903
01:17:19,666 --> 01:17:21,000
How will we do that?

904
01:17:23,291 --> 01:17:25,166
-We go down there,

905
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:28,875
they'll quite rightfully
rope us, rob us, and rape us.

906
01:17:28,958 --> 01:17:31,166
And if they were here
and we were there,

907
01:17:31,791 --> 01:17:33,166
we'd do the same to them.

908
01:17:37,666 --> 01:17:38,666
Bella.

909
01:17:39,541 --> 01:17:40,541
Bella.

910
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:43,666
-Bella.

911
01:19:24,958 --> 01:19:26,291
We are casting off, ma'am.

912
01:19:26,791 --> 01:19:28,291
But I have to go back.

913
01:19:29,375 --> 01:19:33,166
I... I must give this money
to the poor near the hotel,

914
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:34,875
in what they call a slum.

915
01:19:36,125 --> 01:19:37,541
We're staying ashore, ma'am.

916
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:39,958
We could take care
of that for you.

917
01:19:40,791 --> 01:19:42,458
-You can?
-Of course.

918
01:19:43,083 --> 01:19:44,666
It is generous of you.

919
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:46,333
They need money.

920
01:19:46,833 --> 01:19:48,041
Everyone does.

921
01:19:53,708 --> 01:19:54,750
Thank you.

922
01:20:11,916 --> 01:20:13,625
You! Get me the captain.

923
01:20:13,708 --> 01:20:15,333
Now we'll find
this fucking thief.

924
01:20:15,416 --> 01:20:16,416
Bella!

925
01:20:18,166 --> 01:20:19,208
We've been robbed!

926
01:20:20,083 --> 01:20:21,416
I... I won.

927
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:23,041
I won everything

928
01:20:23,125 --> 01:20:24,666
like never before.

929
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:27,000
And now it's gone.

930
01:20:27,083 --> 01:20:28,875
You've not been robbed.

931
01:20:28,958 --> 01:20:30,791
-I took it.
-For what?

932
01:20:31,375 --> 01:20:32,416
I took it.

933
01:20:34,333 --> 01:20:35,625
I'm so tired.

934
01:20:37,625 --> 01:20:39,958
Or maybe just my spirit is.

935
01:20:40,833 --> 01:20:43,458
My soul has been buckled,
crumpled,

936
01:20:43,916 --> 01:20:46,458
flattened, Duncan Wedderburn,

937
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:48,833
by the sights I have seen.

938
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,291
So, no need
for the captain then, sir?

939
01:20:53,375 --> 01:20:54,791
Fuck off before
I break all your teeth.

940
01:20:56,916 --> 01:20:58,083
Indeed, sir.

941
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:02,791
Where is it?

942
01:21:03,541 --> 01:21:05,125
You hid it for safety.

943
01:21:05,208 --> 01:21:07,500
I was drunk and foolishly
left it everywhere.

944
01:21:07,583 --> 01:21:08,625
What a relief.

945
01:21:09,291 --> 01:21:11,041
I did not hide it.

946
01:21:11,833 --> 01:21:15,208
I gave it to those poor people
out there.

947
01:21:15,791 --> 01:21:18,916
Money is its own form
of sickness,

948
01:21:19,458 --> 01:21:21,125
and all the scarcity of it.

949
01:21:22,541 --> 01:21:24,041
And who am I,

950
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:26,708
lying in a feather bed,

951
01:21:27,916 --> 01:21:29,458
while dead babies

952
01:21:29,958 --> 01:21:31,416
lie in a ditch?

953
01:21:33,375 --> 01:21:34,416
Duncan.

954
01:21:36,166 --> 01:21:38,000
You what?

955
01:21:39,625 --> 01:21:42,666
I am expecting
a hug of solace.

956
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:44,500
You...

957
01:21:44,583 --> 01:21:47,166
I need to offer something
to the world.

958
01:21:48,125 --> 01:21:49,625
And yet I have nothing.

959
01:21:50,916 --> 01:21:52,125
Except some money.

960
01:21:54,083 --> 01:21:56,875
It is a bad day
for Bella Baxter.

961
01:21:57,958 --> 01:22:01,208
Where is my fucking money?

962
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:02,583
I just told you.

963
01:22:02,666 --> 01:22:05,416
I gave it away to the poor.

964
01:22:07,166 --> 01:22:09,166
I thought
I told you to fuck off!

965
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:11,625
The steward informs me

966
01:22:11,708 --> 01:22:13,375
that you may not have
sufficient funds

967
01:22:13,458 --> 01:22:14,791
to make good
your account, sir.

968
01:22:15,458 --> 01:22:17,208
-Well, I...
-That is probably true.

969
01:22:18,083 --> 01:22:20,041
I gave it all to some nice men

970
01:22:21,083 --> 01:22:22,416
to pass on

971
01:22:22,916 --> 01:22:24,916
to the slum poor.

972
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,208
You'll be put ashore
at the next port

973
01:22:27,291 --> 01:22:29,750
and confined to crew's rations
until then, sir.

974
01:22:29,833 --> 01:22:31,583
-Good evening.
- How dare you?

975
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:46,125
"Dead, blind babies

976
01:22:47,583 --> 01:22:48,916
"bit Harry.

977
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:52,500
"My mouth

978
01:22:52,583 --> 01:22:56,000
"was full of blood."

979
01:22:57,333 --> 01:22:58,458
Poor Bella.

980
01:23:00,291 --> 01:23:01,583
She is a ruin.

981
01:23:06,750 --> 01:23:08,500
How's your hand?
It's fine.

982
01:23:09,041 --> 01:23:10,166
I'm sorry.

983
01:23:10,250 --> 01:23:12,041
You were trying
to help me understand.

984
01:23:12,125 --> 01:23:14,666
No. I actually
wanted to hurt you.

985
01:23:15,875 --> 01:23:16,875
Couldn't bear to see

986
01:23:16,958 --> 01:23:19,916
such dumb, beautiful happiness
in someone.

987
01:23:20,416 --> 01:23:21,666
It was cruel of me.

988
01:23:22,333 --> 01:23:23,500
I am not sorry.

989
01:23:24,375 --> 01:23:26,291
If I know the world,
I can improve it.

990
01:23:26,375 --> 01:23:27,500
You can't.

991
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,416
That is the real point.

992
01:23:30,041 --> 01:23:31,666
Don't accept the lie
of religion,

993
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:32,750
socialism,

994
01:23:33,291 --> 01:23:34,375
capitalism.

995
01:23:34,833 --> 01:23:36,500
We are a fucked species.

996
01:23:36,583 --> 01:23:38,958
Know it. Hope is smashable.

997
01:23:39,041 --> 01:23:40,250
Realism is not.

998
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:42,458
Protect yourself
with the truth.

999
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:46,375
I realize
what you are now, Harry.

1000
01:23:46,458 --> 01:23:47,625
Just a broken little boy

1001
01:23:47,708 --> 01:23:49,625
who cannot bear
the pain of the world.

1002
01:23:51,541 --> 01:23:52,666
I suppose so.

1003
01:24:01,875 --> 01:24:03,000
Goodbye, Harry.

1004
01:24:03,083 --> 01:24:04,916
We get thrown off
in Marseille.

1005
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:07,250
Why do you stay with him?

1006
01:24:07,833 --> 01:24:09,333
I always think
it will be better.

1007
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:12,375
'Course you do.

1008
01:24:28,833 --> 01:24:31,500
I have heard great things
of the beauty of Paris.

1009
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:37,416
I'll fucking kick
your dog to death.

1010
01:24:40,833 --> 01:24:41,833
Fucking...

1011
01:24:42,375 --> 01:24:44,000
Paris with no money.

1012
01:24:44,458 --> 01:24:46,125
What do you suggest
we do, Bella?

1013
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:47,458
I will get us a hotel.

1014
01:24:47,541 --> 01:24:48,583
Do not worry.

1015
01:24:48,666 --> 01:24:50,791
Uh-huh. With what?
We have no money.

1016
01:24:52,666 --> 01:24:55,250
Is it not
an interesting experiment?

1017
01:24:55,333 --> 01:24:56,333
We have nothing.

1018
01:24:56,958 --> 01:24:58,916
-How will we live now?
-I don't know!

1019
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,916
Exactly,
that is the experiment.

1020
01:25:01,333 --> 01:25:02,541
We are now the poor.

1021
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:06,125
Also, many adventurers
have faced these odds.

1022
01:25:06,708 --> 01:25:08,083
Robinson Crusoe, for example.

1023
01:25:08,625 --> 01:25:11,166
Selfish, thoughtless,
careless bitch.

1024
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:13,625
I'm not thoughtless, Duncan.

1025
01:25:14,250 --> 01:25:15,666
And while it is true
my ability

1026
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:18,916
to think things through to
the logical conclusions is not

1027
01:25:19,541 --> 01:25:20,708
strong,

1028
01:25:21,125 --> 01:25:23,125
I did help
those suffering people.

1029
01:25:23,583 --> 01:25:24,583
I have ruined us,

1030
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,250
as you pointed out,

1031
01:25:26,791 --> 01:25:29,041
but I do believe my actions
come from a good place.

1032
01:25:29,125 --> 01:25:31,333
Shut the fuck up.

1033
01:25:32,208 --> 01:25:33,583
I will get us a hotel.

1034
01:25:38,916 --> 01:25:40,416
Good afternoon, madam.

1035
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:43,666
Good day, my fresh,
darling English Rose.

1036
01:25:44,625 --> 01:25:45,625
Is this a hotel?

1037
01:25:45,708 --> 01:25:46,958
We have rooms.

1038
01:25:47,458 --> 01:25:48,625
Are you looking for work?

1039
01:25:48,708 --> 01:25:49,958
How much is a room?

1040
01:25:50,041 --> 01:25:52,208
I'll charge you
10 francs an hour.

1041
01:25:52,291 --> 01:25:54,416
You charge them 30.

1042
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:55,625
Everyone's happy.

1043
01:25:56,250 --> 01:25:57,250
I see.

1044
01:25:57,750 --> 01:25:59,166
Monsieur Chapelle.

1045
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:00,333
Fresh from London.

1046
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:02,875
Enchanté. Hello.

1047
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:07,875
Merci.

1048
01:26:09,083 --> 01:26:10,291
So, off you go.

1049
01:26:10,750 --> 01:26:12,291
At this point, I am confused.

1050
01:26:12,666 --> 01:26:14,166
You're not here to work?

1051
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:15,500
Oh, come on.

1052
01:26:15,583 --> 01:26:18,125
Lie with him,
let him cock you a bit

1053
01:26:18,208 --> 01:26:19,625
and make some nice francs.

1054
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,000
I see.

1055
01:26:21,625 --> 01:26:22,916
He would pay me for this?

1056
01:26:23,416 --> 01:26:24,416
Yes.

1057
01:26:24,958 --> 01:26:26,500
If you need money,

1058
01:26:26,583 --> 01:26:28,666
it is the shortest route
to it.

1059
01:26:29,666 --> 01:26:32,541
I have never been cocked
by another man,

1060
01:26:33,208 --> 01:26:34,666
and yet have wondered on that.

1061
01:26:35,583 --> 01:26:37,000
And am in need of funds.

1062
01:26:38,416 --> 01:26:41,916
It is, I believe,
a confluence of circumstances

1063
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,041
I regard as almost fate-like.

1064
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:45,833
Let us do this.

1065
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:49,750
Room 16.

1066
01:27:27,458 --> 01:27:28,583
What is your name?

1067
01:27:36,625 --> 01:27:37,791
Mysterious.

1068
01:28:05,541 --> 01:28:08,083
Should we warm me up
a bit...

1069
01:28:08,708 --> 01:28:09,833
Oh.

1070
01:28:31,833 --> 01:28:33,166
Merci.

1071
01:28:40,083 --> 01:28:41,083
Good day, sir.

1072
01:28:41,541 --> 01:28:43,000
Éclair au chocolat?

1073
01:28:44,375 --> 01:28:46,916
I've come into some money
and some enlightenment.

1074
01:28:47,791 --> 01:28:48,833
You stole it?

1075
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:52,041
You've always said you're
the best bedman in the world,

1076
01:28:52,416 --> 01:28:53,791
and I have never
known another,

1077
01:28:53,875 --> 01:28:56,041
so I knew not
whether this was true.

1078
01:28:56,583 --> 01:28:57,791
But now I do.

1079
01:28:58,416 --> 01:28:59,666
And he was terrible

1080
01:29:00,125 --> 01:29:03,250
and made ungodly noises
as he thrust himself into me.

1081
01:29:03,333 --> 01:29:05,708
And a mere three thrusts,
Duncan Wedderburn,

1082
01:29:05,791 --> 01:29:06,958
was all he could manage.

1083
01:29:07,291 --> 01:29:08,666
I stifled a laugh,

1084
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:10,666
out of polites, of course.

1085
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:12,875
I took his money.
I thanked him.

1086
01:29:12,958 --> 01:29:15,458
I laughed all the way
to buy us these éclairs,

1087
01:29:15,541 --> 01:29:16,666
and I thought so fondly,

1088
01:29:17,541 --> 01:29:20,250
remembering the fierce
sweaty nights of ours.

1089
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:23,375
You fucked for money?

1090
01:29:23,708 --> 01:29:25,125
And as an experiment.

1091
01:29:25,916 --> 01:29:27,750
And it is good
for our relationship

1092
01:29:27,833 --> 01:29:30,000
as it gladdens my heart
toward you.

1093
01:29:30,083 --> 01:29:31,458
My heart has been a bit dim

1094
01:29:31,541 --> 01:29:33,875
on your weepy,
sweary person lately.

1095
01:29:35,708 --> 01:29:38,250
You are a monster.
A whore and a monster.

1096
01:29:38,333 --> 01:29:39,833
A demon sent from hell

1097
01:29:39,916 --> 01:29:41,625
to rip my spirit to shreds.

1098
01:29:41,708 --> 01:29:44,625
To punish my tiny sins

1099
01:29:44,708 --> 01:29:46,458
with a tsunami of destruction.

1100
01:29:46,541 --> 01:29:48,333
To take my heart
and pull it like taffy

1101
01:29:48,416 --> 01:29:49,416
to ruin me.

1102
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:51,416
I look at you, and I see
nothing but ugliness.

1103
01:29:52,916 --> 01:29:55,958
That last bit was uncalled for
and makes no sense,

1104
01:29:56,041 --> 01:29:58,750
as your odes to my beauty
have been boring

1105
01:29:58,833 --> 01:29:59,875
but constant.

1106
01:30:00,458 --> 01:30:02,708
And the simple act

1107
01:30:02,791 --> 01:30:05,416
of letting a strange man
ride on me

1108
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:06,541
has erased all that?

1109
01:30:08,875 --> 01:30:09,958
Fuck!

1110
01:30:10,041 --> 01:30:12,125
You whored yourself.

1111
01:30:12,625 --> 01:30:14,875
Which you are now going
to explain to me is bad.

1112
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:16,458
Can I never win with you?

1113
01:30:16,541 --> 01:30:19,333
It is the worst thing
women can do.

1114
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:22,541
We should definitely
never marry.

1115
01:30:23,416 --> 01:30:25,666
I am a flawed,
experimenting person

1116
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:28,625
and I will need a husband with
a more forgiving disposition.

1117
01:30:29,250 --> 01:30:30,666
Cunt!

1118
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:32,333
I can now see
you are not that.

1119
01:30:33,166 --> 01:30:34,583
Our adventure is clearly over.

1120
01:30:35,208 --> 01:30:37,208
I shall book you
a passage back to London.

1121
01:30:37,666 --> 01:30:39,083
You had money

1122
01:30:39,791 --> 01:30:40,791
this whole time?

1123
01:30:40,875 --> 01:30:42,250
It is God's money.

1124
01:30:43,291 --> 01:30:44,416
For emergencies.

1125
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:46,916
It has been a fucking
emergency for weeks now!

1126
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,791
I believed in you
the whole time,

1127
01:30:49,291 --> 01:30:50,916
that you would rise
to the occasion.

1128
01:30:51,375 --> 01:30:52,916
But now I see
that was a mistake,

1129
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,750
and there's clearly
something broken in you.

1130
01:30:54,833 --> 01:30:57,000
You broke
that something in me!

1131
01:30:57,083 --> 01:30:59,500
I feel this conversation
has become circular.

1132
01:30:59,583 --> 01:31:02,000
Cunt!

1133
01:31:08,208 --> 01:31:10,625
Madam Swiney,
I have examined my situation.

1134
01:31:10,708 --> 01:31:12,291
I need sex and money.

1135
01:31:12,791 --> 01:31:14,083
I could take a lover,

1136
01:31:14,166 --> 01:31:16,000
another Wedderburn
who would keep me

1137
01:31:16,083 --> 01:31:18,250
but may require
an awful lot of attention.

1138
01:31:18,333 --> 01:31:20,125
Or else
it's 20 minutes at a time,

1139
01:31:20,208 --> 01:31:22,416
and the rest of my day
is free to study on the world

1140
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:23,666
and the improvement of it.

1141
01:31:24,208 --> 01:31:26,625
Hence, I seek employment

1142
01:31:26,708 --> 01:31:28,416
at your musty-smelling
establishment

1143
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:29,625
of good-time fornication.

1144
01:31:29,708 --> 01:31:32,750
A woman plotting
her course to freedom.

1145
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:34,958
How delightful.

1146
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:36,750
Come.

1147
01:31:40,291 --> 01:31:42,500
Ah, Monsieur Saveur.

1148
01:31:44,250 --> 01:31:45,291
A filet mignon.

1149
01:31:45,875 --> 01:31:47,833
A prime cut.

1150
01:31:48,125 --> 01:31:49,166
Merci.

1151
01:32:00,833 --> 01:32:02,125
Bella.

1152
01:32:03,916 --> 01:32:05,500
Say "formidable" at the end.

1153
01:32:05,583 --> 01:32:06,625
House rules.

1154
01:32:35,583 --> 01:32:37,125
Is that smell you?

1155
01:33:11,916 --> 01:33:13,041
Formidable.

1156
01:33:13,833 --> 01:33:14,833
Merci.

1157
01:33:25,958 --> 01:33:27,125
For the smell.

1158
01:33:28,083 --> 01:33:30,083
And tea.
Just because tea is nice.

1159
01:33:32,291 --> 01:33:33,291
Merci.

1160
01:33:34,166 --> 01:33:35,375
It was brutal

1161
01:33:35,875 --> 01:33:37,375
in a strangely
not unpleasant way.

1162
01:33:41,458 --> 01:33:43,375
Pamphlet.

1163
01:33:43,458 --> 01:33:45,083
- Read.
-What is that?

1164
01:33:45,166 --> 01:33:46,166
Une personne qui veut...

1165
01:33:46,250 --> 01:33:47,875
Change the world.

1166
01:33:47,958 --> 01:33:49,833
Make it better.
A better world.

1167
01:33:50,875 --> 01:33:52,583
Then I am that too.

1168
01:34:03,708 --> 01:34:04,875
Madam Swiney,

1169
01:34:04,958 --> 01:34:06,750
this lineup system,

1170
01:34:06,833 --> 01:34:08,708
you really expect me
to go upstairs with a man

1171
01:34:08,791 --> 01:34:10,458
even if I find him distasteful

1172
01:34:10,791 --> 01:34:12,750
and therefore am sad

1173
01:34:12,833 --> 01:34:14,291
when I let him
furious jump me?

1174
01:34:14,375 --> 01:34:16,875
That is the way it is,
my darling.

1175
01:34:19,958 --> 01:34:21,500
Gosh, you look pretty.

1176
01:34:21,583 --> 01:34:23,750
How it agrees with you
to be ravaged.

1177
01:34:24,625 --> 01:34:25,666
I suppose so.

1178
01:34:26,125 --> 01:34:27,458
-Oui.

1179
01:34:27,541 --> 01:34:29,500
Oui, monsieur Mersault.
Bella.

1180
01:34:30,541 --> 01:34:32,916
So, would you not prefer it
if the women chose,

1181
01:34:33,333 --> 01:34:35,875
as it would be a sign
of enthusiasm toward you?

1182
01:34:36,250 --> 01:34:38,000
Um, you wouldn't have
the vague sense

1183
01:34:38,083 --> 01:34:39,416
that they are
in a state of horror

1184
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:40,500
when you jump them.

1185
01:34:44,375 --> 01:34:47,375
Bella is new
and may have a mental illness.

1186
01:34:51,458 --> 01:34:53,000
As God, my father, says,

1187
01:34:53,375 --> 01:34:56,125
it is only the way it is until
we discover the new way it is,

1188
01:34:56,208 --> 01:34:57,291
and then that is the way it is

1189
01:34:57,375 --> 01:34:58,916
until we discover
the new way it is,

1190
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,250
and so it goes until the world
is no longer flat,

1191
01:35:01,333 --> 01:35:02,750
electricity lights the night,

1192
01:35:02,833 --> 01:35:04,375
and shoes are no longer
tied with ribbons.

1193
01:35:05,625 --> 01:35:07,416
As a socialist,
I agree entirely.

1194
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:08,500
Formidable.

1195
01:35:08,583 --> 01:35:10,958
Toinette, you have such
a clever mouth.

1196
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:14,375
Monsieur Mersault
will enjoy it for free.

1197
01:35:14,916 --> 01:35:16,500
Go. Now.

1198
01:35:17,208 --> 01:35:19,666
Bella, a moment in my office.

1199
01:35:21,750 --> 01:35:24,458
You have the most
delicious looking lobes.

1200
01:35:25,541 --> 01:35:26,541
Thank you.

1201
01:35:26,625 --> 01:35:27,708
I must...

1202
01:35:30,916 --> 01:35:33,375
-Oh, I am sorry. I drew blood.

1203
01:35:34,208 --> 01:35:35,291
Here.

1204
01:35:37,833 --> 01:35:39,958
I sometimes give in to myself

1205
01:35:40,041 --> 01:35:42,125
when I see beauty,
young beauty.

1206
01:35:42,208 --> 01:35:43,750
For one day, my dear,

1207
01:35:43,833 --> 01:35:47,041
you will be a wrinkled,
old husk.

1208
01:35:47,125 --> 01:35:49,541
And no one will want you
either to pay you for it

1209
01:35:49,625 --> 01:35:51,541
or to have it for free.

1210
01:35:52,208 --> 01:35:54,875
I still believe everyone would
be happier if we could choose.

1211
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:56,500
An idealist.

1212
01:35:56,833 --> 01:35:58,000
Like me.

1213
01:35:58,458 --> 01:36:00,833
How delightful you are.

1214
01:36:00,916 --> 01:36:03,583
But we must give in
to the demands

1215
01:36:03,666 --> 01:36:05,250
of the world sometimes.

1216
01:36:05,333 --> 01:36:07,125
Grapple with it,
try to defeat it.

1217
01:36:07,208 --> 01:36:09,583
-So you believe as me?
-Of course.

1218
01:36:09,666 --> 01:36:13,875
But some men enjoy
that you do not like it.

1219
01:36:13,958 --> 01:36:14,958
What?

1220
01:36:16,541 --> 01:36:17,708
-That is...
-Sick.

1221
01:36:17,791 --> 01:36:19,583
But good business.

1222
01:36:20,208 --> 01:36:21,458
Come with me.

1223
01:36:26,458 --> 01:36:27,875
My grandchild.

1224
01:36:28,666 --> 01:36:32,041
Sick and poorly,
and requiring much doctoring.

1225
01:36:32,125 --> 01:36:36,875
My choice of giving you choice
will jeopardize the business.

1226
01:36:36,958 --> 01:36:38,666
Her health. Her life.

1227
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:41,166
-Do you want that, Bella?
-Of course not.

1228
01:36:41,250 --> 01:36:43,041
You don't? You're so lovely.

1229
01:36:45,208 --> 01:36:46,833
I thought you were going
for my lobes.

1230
01:36:48,791 --> 01:36:50,125
We must work.

1231
01:36:51,083 --> 01:36:53,333
We must make money.

1232
01:36:53,416 --> 01:36:56,750
But more than that,
we must experience everything,

1233
01:36:56,833 --> 01:36:58,208
not just the good.

1234
01:36:58,291 --> 01:37:01,541
But degradation,
horror, sadness...

1235
01:37:01,625 --> 01:37:04,166
This makes us whole, Bella.

1236
01:37:04,250 --> 01:37:06,458
Makes us people of substance,

1237
01:37:06,541 --> 01:37:08,833
not flighty,
untouched children.

1238
01:37:10,208 --> 01:37:11,958
Then we can know the world.

1239
01:37:13,041 --> 01:37:15,083
And when we know the world,

1240
01:37:15,458 --> 01:37:17,333
the world is ours.

1241
01:37:18,291 --> 01:37:19,416
I want that.

1242
01:37:20,166 --> 01:37:21,708
Now,

1243
01:37:21,791 --> 01:37:23,666
go and fuck someone

1244
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:26,583
and bring me 10 francs.

1245
01:37:30,375 --> 01:37:32,750
First, I suggest a short quiz.

1246
01:37:33,541 --> 01:37:34,541
A quiz?

1247
01:37:35,250 --> 01:37:37,041
You tell me
a childhood memory.

1248
01:37:39,875 --> 01:37:42,291
Then I tell a joke. Toc toc.

1249
01:37:42,750 --> 01:37:44,458
Then a quick sniff,

1250
01:37:44,541 --> 01:37:47,791
and if necessary,
a quick douse in lavender oil.

1251
01:37:47,875 --> 01:37:50,791
And all of this
will enhance the experience,

1252
01:37:50,875 --> 01:37:52,416
making it formidable.

1253
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:53,500
Toc toc.

1254
01:37:54,166 --> 01:37:55,166
Toc toc.

1255
01:37:55,666 --> 01:37:57,500
Non, I tell the joke.

1256
01:37:57,583 --> 01:37:58,833
You the memory.

1257
01:37:59,666 --> 01:38:01,250
-Mm.
-Le souvenir.

1258
01:38:09,041 --> 01:38:11,250
When you were
little in Greece,

1259
01:38:11,333 --> 01:38:13,041
you fell from your bicycle?

1260
01:38:13,125 --> 01:38:14,208
Oui.

1261
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,125
Mm.

1262
01:38:19,791 --> 01:38:21,166
Blood.
Down my leg.

1263
01:38:21,250 --> 01:38:22,250
Mm.

1264
01:38:24,708 --> 01:38:26,666
"Joie." Joy?

1265
01:38:26,750 --> 01:38:28,333
You watched the blood
with joy.

1266
01:38:28,416 --> 01:38:30,166
-Oui.
-Knock, knock.

1267
01:38:30,958 --> 01:38:32,583
-Qui c'est?
-Fromage.

1268
01:38:32,875 --> 01:38:33,916
Fromage qui?

1269
01:38:34,333 --> 01:38:35,541
Cheese to meet you.

1270
01:38:46,291 --> 01:38:47,375
You know it.

1271
01:38:51,708 --> 01:38:52,958
You smell okay.

1272
01:38:53,041 --> 01:38:54,041
Let us fuck.

1273
01:39:39,625 --> 01:39:42,041
God gave you a gift,
my friend.

1274
01:40:22,791 --> 01:40:24,875
Very inelegant work.

1275
01:40:25,208 --> 01:40:26,875
This is what you do
when you're homesick?

1276
01:40:40,916 --> 01:40:42,916
-You wish what?

1277
01:40:43,250 --> 01:40:45,958
My boys are of an age
for education. Sexual.

1278
01:40:47,583 --> 01:40:48,666
I will demonstrate.

1279
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:50,500
I see.

1280
01:40:58,208 --> 01:40:59,208
At times.

1281
01:41:13,833 --> 01:41:16,000
Shall I lay,
bend, astride?

1282
01:41:16,833 --> 01:41:18,416
-Let's start simple, please.
-Mm.

1283
01:41:52,750 --> 01:41:54,208
To aid things along,

1284
01:41:54,291 --> 01:41:56,125
-a finger in the arse.
-No.

1285
01:41:56,208 --> 01:41:58,250
Or a slight choking may do it.

1286
01:42:26,166 --> 01:42:28,250
-Go home!

1287
01:42:35,083 --> 01:42:36,583
Bella!

1288
01:42:37,750 --> 01:42:39,458
Madam Swiney was right.

1289
01:42:39,625 --> 01:42:42,458
I am discovering parts
of myself hitherto unknown.

1290
01:42:42,541 --> 01:42:44,083
It is a way to look at it.

1291
01:42:44,833 --> 01:42:48,041
The variety of desires being
made manifest is fascinating.

1292
01:42:48,125 --> 01:42:49,166
Have you had the man

1293
01:42:49,250 --> 01:42:50,791
who puts a wedge of pineapple
in your mouth

1294
01:42:50,875 --> 01:42:51,875
and covers you in dust?

1295
01:42:53,541 --> 01:42:54,541
Bella.

1296
01:42:55,750 --> 01:42:57,375
I'm almost ready
to forgive you.

1297
01:42:57,541 --> 01:42:58,791
I've booked our berths home,

1298
01:42:58,958 --> 01:43:01,500
and I've told Mother
to prepare our wedding bed.

1299
01:43:02,625 --> 01:43:04,375
Did you fuck that guy
with hooks for hands?

1300
01:43:04,541 --> 01:43:06,041
You did. I know!

1301
01:43:06,750 --> 01:43:09,208
I beat the tar
out of that guy.

1302
01:43:09,375 --> 01:43:11,250
Duncan. I thought you left.

1303
01:43:11,416 --> 01:43:13,791
Back to the ship,
but started to ache and vomit,

1304
01:43:14,083 --> 01:43:15,250
so I'm here to save you.

1305
01:43:15,458 --> 01:43:16,625
Hello, Duncan.

1306
01:43:19,916 --> 01:43:21,125
Go home, Duncan.

1307
01:43:21,291 --> 01:43:22,750
Our time has ended.

1308
01:43:22,916 --> 01:43:23,958
I look at you and feel nothing

1309
01:43:24,041 --> 01:43:26,083
but the lingering question
of how did I ever want you?

1310
01:43:26,166 --> 01:43:27,166
Oh...

1311
01:43:27,250 --> 01:43:29,000
And we must go
to the meeting of socialists.

1312
01:43:31,791 --> 01:43:33,083
You're whores.

1313
01:43:33,166 --> 01:43:35,541
We are our own means
of production.

1314
01:43:35,625 --> 01:43:36,708
Go away.

1315
01:43:49,333 --> 01:43:50,333
Foot.

1316
01:43:52,333 --> 01:43:53,666
Paint, foot.

1317
01:43:53,750 --> 01:43:54,750
Very good.

1318
01:43:58,166 --> 01:44:00,625
Language is slow
but improving.

1319
01:44:00,708 --> 01:44:01,791
Paint. Foot.

1320
01:44:01,875 --> 01:44:02,875
Genius.

1321
01:44:03,750 --> 01:44:05,791
Can you not be
so cruel to her?

1322
01:44:05,875 --> 01:44:07,416
I made a mistake with Bella.

1323
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:09,375
I allowed feelings to develop.

1324
01:44:10,166 --> 01:44:11,375
There are none for her.

1325
01:44:11,458 --> 01:44:13,875
She is no different
to the chicken dog.

1326
01:44:13,958 --> 01:44:14,958
Foot.

1327
01:44:15,041 --> 01:44:17,041
It is better
this way, perhaps,

1328
01:44:17,125 --> 01:44:20,291
and gives some insight into
my father's coolness to me.

1329
01:44:20,375 --> 01:44:23,083
It was a necessity of science.

1330
01:44:23,166 --> 01:44:24,333
Good God, man.

1331
01:44:24,416 --> 01:44:26,166
-Foot.
-I do not expect you

1332
01:44:26,250 --> 01:44:28,375
to understand, village doctor.

1333
01:44:29,708 --> 01:44:32,208
By the way,
I need you to operate on me.

1334
01:44:32,708 --> 01:44:34,916
Shall I put a beating heart
in your monstrous form?

1335
01:44:35,791 --> 01:44:37,041
If you have time

1336
01:44:37,916 --> 01:44:39,166
while taking...

1337
01:44:41,125 --> 01:44:42,208
this out.

1338
01:44:59,750 --> 01:45:02,458
I'll remove some cysts
from around the tumor.

1339
01:45:02,541 --> 01:45:05,083
No need. You may close me up.

1340
01:45:05,875 --> 01:45:08,458
It has spread.
I see tiny polyps.

1341
01:45:11,666 --> 01:45:13,041
I am dying.

1342
01:45:13,125 --> 01:45:15,958
How to break it
to the patient, eh?

1343
01:45:16,333 --> 01:45:17,458
Baxter...

1344
01:45:17,541 --> 01:45:18,625
Do not cry into the wound!

1345
01:45:18,708 --> 01:45:20,375
You'll kill me faster
with sepsis.

1346
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Quiet now.

1347
01:45:22,083 --> 01:45:23,500
And close me up.

1348
01:45:25,208 --> 01:45:26,583
Find her.

1349
01:45:31,916 --> 01:45:33,500
I am closed.

1350
01:45:40,750 --> 01:45:42,625
Hot chocolate,
my dear.

1351
01:45:42,708 --> 01:45:44,791
And pain au chocolat.

1352
01:45:53,250 --> 01:45:54,375
You are my favorite.

1353
01:45:56,666 --> 01:45:59,291
I have heard you say that
to the others.

1354
01:45:59,375 --> 01:46:01,125
We are a machine you feed

1355
01:46:01,208 --> 01:46:02,875
with compliments
and chocolate.

1356
01:46:02,958 --> 01:46:05,125
You are my children
I feed with love.

1357
01:46:11,875 --> 01:46:14,833
Something terrible
has happened, Swiney.

1358
01:46:15,416 --> 01:46:17,375
I feel almost nothing.

1359
01:46:18,916 --> 01:46:22,125
My empathy is creeping
toward what I would describe

1360
01:46:22,291 --> 01:46:24,416
as contemptuous rage.

1361
01:46:24,583 --> 01:46:26,250
This is fabulous.

1362
01:46:26,333 --> 01:46:27,333
It is?

1363
01:46:30,291 --> 01:46:32,333
You're in the dark period.

1364
01:46:33,208 --> 01:46:36,125
Before light and wisdom
come to you.

1365
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:39,333
You must forge through it,

1366
01:46:40,250 --> 01:46:41,833
and once on the other side,

1367
01:46:42,458 --> 01:46:44,208
you will be grateful
to this moment,

1368
01:46:44,291 --> 01:46:46,458
but you must keep going.

1369
01:46:46,541 --> 01:46:47,583
I see.

1370
01:48:03,583 --> 01:48:05,000
You've got a baby scar.

1371
01:48:07,916 --> 01:48:09,208
Mine is with ma maman.

1372
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:12,666
I don't have one.

1373
01:48:14,083 --> 01:48:16,416
It is an accident scar.

1374
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:18,833
But you're not the first
to have made the mistake.

1375
01:48:18,916 --> 01:48:20,000
Why lie?

1376
01:48:20,958 --> 01:48:22,125
I'm not lying.

1377
01:48:22,875 --> 01:48:24,625
My Godwin told me himself.

1378
01:48:42,541 --> 01:48:43,666
Wedderburn.

1379
01:49:08,791 --> 01:49:09,916
Good day, sir.

1380
01:49:14,375 --> 01:49:16,333
You wrote
to Mr. Godwin Baxter.

1381
01:49:16,750 --> 01:49:18,916
He has sent a demon
at large into the world.

1382
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,041
The devil's wrapped
in an alluring body

1383
01:49:21,125 --> 01:49:22,416
that cannot be satiated,

1384
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:25,666
and a mind that picks
people apart stitch by stitch

1385
01:49:25,750 --> 01:49:27,833
like a bloodied
and burned rag doll

1386
01:49:27,916 --> 01:49:29,250
shat out
of an elephant's arse.

1387
01:49:29,333 --> 01:49:30,333
Bella.

1388
01:49:31,041 --> 01:49:32,125
Where is she?

1389
01:49:32,208 --> 01:49:33,250
Who are you?

1390
01:49:33,333 --> 01:49:35,125
I'm her fiancé, sir.

1391
01:49:39,250 --> 01:49:41,958
Obviously, things did not
end well between you.

1392
01:49:42,041 --> 01:49:43,083
Did not?

1393
01:49:43,875 --> 01:49:45,291
She destroyed me.

1394
01:49:45,375 --> 01:49:48,208
Well, we're all masters
of our own ship, sir.

1395
01:49:48,291 --> 01:49:49,291
There's that.

1396
01:49:49,375 --> 01:49:52,666
I do not like you
or your words.

1397
01:49:52,750 --> 01:49:54,083
That Godwin Baxter.

1398
01:49:54,166 --> 01:49:56,291
He knew,
and he set her on to me.

1399
01:49:56,375 --> 01:49:57,375
He trapped me.

1400
01:49:59,250 --> 01:50:00,250
Where is she?

1401
01:50:00,333 --> 01:50:03,083
Would not wish her
on my worst enemy.

1402
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,541
I shall save you
from her, sir.

1403
01:50:21,166 --> 01:50:23,833
Forgive my frustration.
Just tell me.

1404
01:50:23,916 --> 01:50:25,458
It does not hurt.

1405
01:50:25,541 --> 01:50:27,875
I have no insides.

1406
01:50:27,958 --> 01:50:29,833
She hollowed me out.

1407
01:50:29,916 --> 01:50:32,291
My soul. My bank account!

1408
01:50:32,833 --> 01:50:34,125
I am a bug! A shell!

1409
01:50:34,291 --> 01:50:35,291
Shall we sing?

1410
01:50:35,375 --> 01:50:37,708
Oh, we are sailors...

1411
01:50:37,791 --> 01:50:39,583
-It doesn't...

1412
01:50:40,708 --> 01:50:42,125
Doesn't hurt.

1413
01:50:44,250 --> 01:50:46,083
I do not wish it
to be like this.

1414
01:50:47,458 --> 01:50:48,625
You force my hand.

1415
01:50:48,708 --> 01:50:51,333
"We're all masters
of our own ship."

1416
01:50:51,416 --> 01:50:54,291
You cunting
cunt-faced deadshit.

1417
01:50:54,708 --> 01:50:55,708
Please.

1418
01:50:55,791 --> 01:50:57,541
I ask you
as politely as I can.

1419
01:50:57,625 --> 01:50:59,583
Where is she?

1420
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,000
Merci.

1421
01:51:55,875 --> 01:51:57,625
The whore is back.

1422
01:52:02,791 --> 01:52:04,500
-God?
-Bella!

1423
01:52:05,166 --> 01:52:06,708
Max wrote me.

1424
01:52:07,125 --> 01:52:09,250
-You are ill?
-I am not. I am dying.

1425
01:52:09,333 --> 01:52:10,333
A subtle difference,

1426
01:52:10,416 --> 01:52:13,208
but one I take seriously
as a physician.

1427
01:52:13,291 --> 01:52:15,000
You are a sight
and a good one.

1428
01:52:15,083 --> 01:52:16,083
You cannot die.

1429
01:52:16,166 --> 01:52:18,375
Empirical data says different.

1430
01:52:19,625 --> 01:52:20,625
I missed you.

1431
01:52:21,916 --> 01:52:24,833
I now have to lie down.

1432
01:52:31,041 --> 01:52:32,833
It is not all sunshine
I bring.

1433
01:52:34,416 --> 01:52:37,125
I also bring beady eyes
and hard questions.

1434
01:52:38,833 --> 01:52:40,333
Did I have a baby in me?

1435
01:52:41,250 --> 01:52:42,500
And if so, where is it?

1436
01:52:42,833 --> 01:52:43,916
I see.

1437
01:52:44,875 --> 01:52:48,666
Well, technically,
you are your baby.

1438
01:52:48,750 --> 01:52:51,541
And also, I suppose
you are your mother.

1439
01:52:51,625 --> 01:52:53,541
And also neither.

1440
01:52:53,625 --> 01:52:55,500
No memory survives.

1441
01:52:55,583 --> 01:52:57,250
No experiences survive.

1442
01:52:58,250 --> 01:53:00,333
What do you mean
I am mother and daughter?

1443
01:53:18,458 --> 01:53:20,041
You knew and did not tell.

1444
01:53:20,458 --> 01:53:23,250
I... did not see
good reason to.

1445
01:53:23,333 --> 01:53:24,583
And were too cowardly to.

1446
01:53:24,666 --> 01:53:26,333
A bit of that as well.

1447
01:53:27,833 --> 01:53:29,375
I wanted to be with you,

1448
01:53:29,833 --> 01:53:32,166
and I was not sure
you would even understand.

1449
01:53:32,250 --> 01:53:35,750
And Baxter kind of makes one
a prisoner to him.

1450
01:53:35,833 --> 01:53:37,125
And... And I am...

1451
01:53:40,250 --> 01:53:41,250
I'm sorry.

1452
01:53:52,208 --> 01:53:53,291
-Bam.

1453
01:53:54,375 --> 01:53:55,416
-Bam.

1454
01:53:56,541 --> 01:53:57,541
-Bam.

1455
01:53:58,708 --> 01:53:59,708
-Bam.

1456
01:54:00,875 --> 01:54:01,958
-Bam.

1457
01:54:02,916 --> 01:54:03,916
-Bam.

1458
01:54:05,166 --> 01:54:06,250
-Bam.

1459
01:54:06,333 --> 01:54:07,333
Who is this?

1460
01:54:07,750 --> 01:54:10,375
Bell whore
Bell whore

1461
01:54:10,458 --> 01:54:11,875
I see you've
introduced me then, Prim.

1462
01:54:11,958 --> 01:54:13,750
-I like this one though.
-Bell whore

1463
01:54:13,833 --> 01:54:14,833
That's enough now,
Felicity...

1464
01:54:14,916 --> 01:54:16,458
-Bell whore
-Ah, f...

1465
01:54:16,541 --> 01:54:17,541
Fucker.

1466
01:54:18,916 --> 01:54:19,916
Another one?

1467
01:54:20,791 --> 01:54:21,833
We missed you.

1468
01:54:22,208 --> 01:54:23,541
Monsters.

1469
01:54:25,333 --> 01:54:26,916
Oh, fucking hell.

1470
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:28,666
Bell whore

1471
01:54:29,125 --> 01:54:30,750
Bell whore

1472
01:55:08,458 --> 01:55:09,833
It is hard
to be in the position

1473
01:55:09,916 --> 01:55:11,375
where one wants to hit someone

1474
01:55:11,458 --> 01:55:13,500
who is already
in obvious pain.

1475
01:55:13,583 --> 01:55:16,375
It is a conundrum
for sure.

1476
01:55:18,125 --> 01:55:20,166
Would you rather be
a gray slab of flesh

1477
01:55:20,250 --> 01:55:22,125
with a fishhook in your nose?

1478
01:55:22,208 --> 01:55:25,166
I will feel good for a second,
but bad for longer, so...

1479
01:55:26,625 --> 01:55:28,291
I really had a fishhook
in my nose?

1480
01:55:28,375 --> 01:55:29,916
You did.

1481
01:55:31,625 --> 01:55:33,500
So, I am your creation...

1482
01:55:35,375 --> 01:55:36,458
as is the other one.

1483
01:55:36,541 --> 01:55:38,125
Neither of you are that.

1484
01:55:38,208 --> 01:55:41,166
She wanders the halls
with a hammer and a song,

1485
01:55:41,250 --> 01:55:42,833
and that is not my doing.

1486
01:55:43,458 --> 01:55:45,708
And I read your cards
and letters home

1487
01:55:45,791 --> 01:55:48,083
and watched you
fearlessly create Bella Baxter

1488
01:55:48,166 --> 01:55:49,166
with wonder.

1489
01:55:49,250 --> 01:55:51,291
I am finding
being alive fascinating,

1490
01:55:51,375 --> 01:55:53,083
so I'll forgive you the act,

1491
01:55:53,916 --> 01:55:56,166
but always hate the lies
and trapping that followed.

1492
01:55:57,125 --> 01:55:58,291
Understood.

1493
01:56:03,750 --> 01:56:04,875
Good to see you.

1494
01:56:05,250 --> 01:56:06,541
You too.

1495
01:56:07,791 --> 01:56:09,875
Anger, confusion,
and brain dissonance aside,

1496
01:56:09,958 --> 01:56:10,958
I missed you.

1497
01:56:12,291 --> 01:56:14,416
I arrived home, and I smelled
the formaldehyde,

1498
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:15,958
and I knew what is next.

1499
01:56:18,666 --> 01:56:19,916
I will be a doctor.

1500
01:56:21,333 --> 01:56:23,416
My surgery is yours.

1501
01:56:25,291 --> 01:56:26,583
My father once told me,

1502
01:56:27,833 --> 01:56:30,750
always carve with compassion.

1503
01:56:30,833 --> 01:56:32,958
He was a fucking idiot.

1504
01:56:33,041 --> 01:56:35,583
But it's not bad advice.

1505
01:56:38,750 --> 01:56:40,375
He does not have long.

1506
01:56:41,416 --> 01:56:42,541
I know.

1507
01:56:43,916 --> 01:56:45,791
You've not mentioned
our betrothal.

1508
01:56:45,875 --> 01:56:46,875
Um...

1509
01:56:47,666 --> 01:56:49,583
You were much younger.

1510
01:56:50,750 --> 01:56:52,125
There is no bind.

1511
01:56:52,208 --> 01:56:55,208
I was mesmerized by you,
and Baxter took advantage.

1512
01:56:55,291 --> 01:56:57,125
So, you are mesmerized
no more?

1513
01:56:57,541 --> 01:57:00,375
I am still mesmerized.

1514
01:57:00,958 --> 01:57:02,416
I've been a whore,
you understand?

1515
01:57:02,750 --> 01:57:05,750
-Mm.
-Cocks for money inside me.

1516
01:57:05,833 --> 01:57:06,958
You okay with that?

1517
01:57:07,791 --> 01:57:10,125
Does the whoring thing
challenge the desire

1518
01:57:10,208 --> 01:57:12,208
for ownership that men have?

1519
01:57:12,291 --> 01:57:14,666
Wedderburn became
much weepy and sweary

1520
01:57:14,750 --> 01:57:16,375
when he discovered my whoring.

1521
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:20,750
I find myself merely jealous
of the men's time with you

1522
01:57:20,833 --> 01:57:23,958
rather than any moral
aspersion against you.

1523
01:57:24,041 --> 01:57:25,666
It is your body, Bella Baxter.

1524
01:57:26,041 --> 01:57:27,541
Yours to give freely.

1525
01:57:28,583 --> 01:57:30,083
I generally charged 30 francs.

1526
01:57:30,541 --> 01:57:32,833
Well, that seems low.

1527
01:57:34,041 --> 01:57:36,750
Do you believe
people improvable, Max?

1528
01:57:36,833 --> 01:57:37,833
I do.

1529
01:57:37,916 --> 01:57:40,833
Just as a human body
can be cured of illness,

1530
01:57:40,916 --> 01:57:44,375
so can men and women
be cured of aspect.

1531
01:57:46,583 --> 01:57:48,500
Will you marry me,
Max McCandles?

1532
01:57:50,625 --> 01:57:51,625
I will.

1533
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:00,541
We will need less of
your tongue in the future,

1534
01:58:00,625 --> 01:58:02,250
but overall, most agreeable.

1535
01:58:02,333 --> 01:58:04,416
Mm. I...
I will take that note.

1536
01:58:06,291 --> 01:58:09,541
And have you been checked
for, um, disease?

1537
01:58:09,625 --> 01:58:11,458
I have not,
but I shall.

1538
01:58:12,125 --> 01:58:14,291
I'm enjoying
this practical love we have.

1539
01:58:15,666 --> 01:58:19,375
Um, but I... I assure you
mine is also passionate.

1540
01:58:20,208 --> 01:58:21,541
You are adorable.

1541
01:58:22,333 --> 01:58:23,500
You always were.

1542
01:58:33,416 --> 01:58:34,750
God, you are walking.

1543
01:58:34,833 --> 01:58:37,000
I have taken
five milligrams of heroin

1544
01:58:37,083 --> 01:58:38,416
through the toes for pain,

1545
01:58:38,500 --> 01:58:39,958
amphetamines for energy,

1546
01:58:40,041 --> 01:58:43,750
and cocaine because
I am partial to cocaine.

1547
01:58:43,833 --> 01:58:46,833
I've come here to walk you
down the aisle.

1548
01:58:59,500 --> 01:59:02,333
And so, by the powers vested
in me by the church,

1549
01:59:02,416 --> 01:59:04,250
I shall solemnize this union.

1550
01:59:05,375 --> 01:59:09,208
Do you, Bella Baxter,
take this man as your husband?

1551
01:59:09,291 --> 01:59:12,166
Did we miss the part about
anyone objecting to this?

1552
01:59:12,791 --> 01:59:14,291
Or has that been removed

1553
01:59:14,375 --> 01:59:16,708
in some kind
of faux modernization

1554
01:59:16,791 --> 01:59:17,791
of the catechism?

1555
01:59:21,041 --> 01:59:22,458
Hello, Victoria.

1556
01:59:23,208 --> 01:59:24,250
You look well.

1557
01:59:25,416 --> 01:59:27,458
Do you refer to me, sir?

1558
01:59:27,541 --> 01:59:30,208
A man doesn't normally
introduce himself to his wife.

1559
01:59:30,291 --> 01:59:31,875
-But if I must...

1560
01:59:33,250 --> 01:59:35,208
He is the God of it.

1561
01:59:35,291 --> 01:59:37,916
I do not know if he's
in her power or she in his.

1562
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,208
'Tis Devil's work at hand.
Look!

1563
01:59:40,291 --> 01:59:43,250
He coughs not air
as a normal man but blood.

1564
01:59:43,333 --> 01:59:45,125
He has cancer,
you fucking idiot.

1565
01:59:45,875 --> 01:59:46,875
Oh.

1566
01:59:46,958 --> 01:59:47,958
Duncan.

1567
01:59:48,041 --> 01:59:50,125
Do not lay
your eyes on me, demon!

1568
01:59:52,333 --> 01:59:55,750
As I was saying,
General Alfred Blessington.

1569
01:59:56,541 --> 01:59:58,125
"Alfie" to you.

1570
01:59:58,208 --> 01:59:59,791
You really do not know me?

1571
02:00:01,083 --> 02:00:03,333
When Mr. Wedderburn
put your photo in the paper...

1572
02:00:03,416 --> 02:00:05,708
I remembered
that old bird in the hotel

1573
02:00:05,791 --> 02:00:07,916
called you
Victoria Blessington,

1574
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:12,250
and I pieced this diabolical
fuckfest of a puzzle together.

1575
02:00:14,250 --> 02:00:16,083
-You are...
-Your dear Alfie.

1576
02:00:16,750 --> 02:00:20,333
You left in a state of some
mental addlement and hysteria

1577
02:00:20,416 --> 02:00:21,416
over your pregnancy.

1578
02:00:22,625 --> 02:00:23,791
On the discovery
of your absence,

1579
02:00:23,875 --> 02:00:25,541
I felt disemboweled.

1580
02:00:26,208 --> 02:00:28,791
I have disemboweled men
on the field of battle,

1581
02:00:28,875 --> 02:00:33,208
and I always imagined a dull,
hollow throbbing,

1582
02:00:33,708 --> 02:00:35,750
and that is what it was like.

1583
02:00:36,375 --> 02:00:37,583
There's also a stench,

1584
02:00:37,666 --> 02:00:41,291
but that does not apply
as a metaphor here.

1585
02:00:42,666 --> 02:00:44,500
But here you are, my darling.

1586
02:00:45,416 --> 02:00:46,416
Here you are.

1587
02:00:46,958 --> 02:00:47,958
God.

1588
02:00:48,041 --> 02:00:49,833
I have no recollection of you.

1589
02:00:50,708 --> 02:00:52,291
I am Bella Baxter.

1590
02:00:52,708 --> 02:00:53,791
Hurtful.

1591
02:00:54,208 --> 02:00:55,750
But perhaps
you've hit your head,

1592
02:00:55,833 --> 02:00:58,125
and these men have clearly
taken advantage of you.

1593
02:00:58,208 --> 02:00:59,958
Please go, sir.

1594
02:01:01,708 --> 02:01:04,166
-You were my husband?
-Your dear Alfie.

1595
02:01:04,250 --> 02:01:06,375
Bella, I'm sorry.

1596
02:01:12,541 --> 02:01:14,208
Actually, I would like to go.

1597
02:01:14,791 --> 02:01:16,666
-What?
-Bella?

1598
02:01:20,500 --> 02:01:22,041
You have a carriage, sir?

1599
02:01:23,166 --> 02:01:24,208
Yes.

1600
02:01:24,291 --> 02:01:25,375
Let us go then.

1601
02:01:25,458 --> 02:01:26,500
Bella!

1602
02:01:26,583 --> 02:01:27,833
Let me go, God.

1603
02:01:28,583 --> 02:01:30,083
Max, you will not stop me.

1604
02:01:39,291 --> 02:01:41,333
It is good to have you back,
Victoria.

1605
02:01:57,791 --> 02:01:59,458
The servants and I
have not been getting along.

1606
02:01:59,541 --> 02:02:01,083
I fear an uprising.

1607
02:02:11,166 --> 02:02:12,666
You remember David, darling?

1608
02:02:14,875 --> 02:02:17,125
Allison, look who's back.

1609
02:02:23,750 --> 02:02:24,958
You know me?

1610
02:02:26,791 --> 02:02:28,166
Tell me about myself.

1611
02:02:30,625 --> 02:02:31,750
Was I nice?

1612
02:03:09,041 --> 02:03:10,041
Eat.

1613
02:03:11,458 --> 02:03:12,625
All your favorites.

1614
02:03:12,708 --> 02:03:14,750
Kippers, goose,

1615
02:03:15,541 --> 02:03:18,083
tongue, champagne.

1616
02:03:18,875 --> 02:03:19,875
I've missed you.

1617
02:03:21,958 --> 02:03:23,958
What was the root
of the unhappiness?

1618
02:03:25,750 --> 02:03:27,958
What drove her
to leap off the bridge?

1619
02:03:30,833 --> 02:03:32,500
You hated the baby.

1620
02:03:32,583 --> 02:03:34,250
You called it "the monster."

1621
02:03:35,458 --> 02:03:36,541
I see.

1622
02:03:38,208 --> 02:03:40,500
I have noticed
a lack of maternal instinct.

1623
02:03:42,166 --> 02:03:44,000
And yet I'm happy
to have you home.

1624
02:03:46,666 --> 02:03:47,791
How did we meet?

1625
02:03:48,458 --> 02:03:49,958
At a ball.

1626
02:03:50,041 --> 02:03:51,541
Why did we like
each other?

1627
02:03:53,125 --> 02:03:54,958
We shared a love
of good times.

1628
02:03:56,708 --> 02:03:57,708
Watch.

1629
02:03:59,166 --> 02:04:01,125
Allison, soup!

1630
02:04:11,041 --> 02:04:12,125
-Rex!

1631
02:04:17,583 --> 02:04:19,625
-Fuck!
-Allison,

1632
02:04:20,375 --> 02:04:22,041
we'll have some cheese
when you can.

1633
02:04:28,541 --> 02:04:30,541
-A love of cruelty?
-Mm.

1634
02:04:32,250 --> 02:04:34,666
I was not a kind person,
it seems.

1635
02:04:34,750 --> 02:04:37,916
Kind? You would never
be so dull, Victoria.

1636
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:39,250
Appalling idea.

1637
02:04:40,458 --> 02:04:41,958
Wedderburn says
you were a whore.

1638
02:04:42,041 --> 02:04:43,916
-I suspect that was part...
-I was.

1639
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,291
In Paris.

1640
02:04:45,375 --> 02:04:47,791
I tired of it,
but it was fascinating.

1641
02:04:49,125 --> 02:04:50,125
Right.

1642
02:04:50,208 --> 02:04:51,750
These kippers
are strangely delicious.

1643
02:04:52,500 --> 02:04:54,291
Vinegary or something.

1644
02:05:01,291 --> 02:05:03,375
Marriage
is a constant challenge.

1645
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,500
Some, we bend to,
some we bend to us.

1646
02:05:08,375 --> 02:05:11,291
I will try to
forgive you for the whoring.

1647
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:15,125
Your sexual hysteria
was often out of hand.

1648
02:05:15,833 --> 02:05:17,750
And for the killing
of our unborn child.

1649
02:05:18,791 --> 02:05:21,208
In fact, when I list the ways
you've wronged me,

1650
02:05:21,291 --> 02:05:22,833
Jesus Christ himself

1651
02:05:22,916 --> 02:05:25,416
would probably
beat your head in with a bat.

1652
02:05:28,958 --> 02:05:31,000
You're blessed
with a forgiving husband.

1653
02:05:32,833 --> 02:05:34,666
I've not wronged you, Alfie,

1654
02:05:35,250 --> 02:05:36,708
as I do not know you.

1655
02:05:36,791 --> 02:05:38,500
Well, you're in luck as
I've had a lot of experience

1656
02:05:38,583 --> 02:05:40,791
in the field with amnesia.

1657
02:05:40,875 --> 02:05:43,666
Either men who wish to forget
where they were,

1658
02:05:43,750 --> 02:05:45,750
or a mortar exploded nearby,

1659
02:05:45,833 --> 02:05:47,875
ringing their cranium
like a church bell.

1660
02:05:48,875 --> 02:05:51,750
I suggest we stick close to
the house for several months,

1661
02:05:51,833 --> 02:05:53,041
maybe a year.

1662
02:05:55,875 --> 02:05:57,541
Until you've made
a full recovery.

1663
02:06:00,166 --> 02:06:01,166
I will leave at my leisure,

1664
02:06:01,250 --> 02:06:03,708
but I am flattered
by your desire to trap me.

1665
02:06:05,916 --> 02:06:07,083
You're not the first.

1666
02:06:09,166 --> 02:06:11,375
I will have to shoot you
in the fucking head

1667
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:13,833
if you try to leave, darling.

1668
02:06:13,916 --> 02:06:15,666
The front or the back
of the head?

1669
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,250
The back.

1670
02:06:17,333 --> 02:06:18,791
As to be sure you were leaving

1671
02:06:18,875 --> 02:06:20,666
and I was not being rash.

1672
02:06:26,208 --> 02:06:27,750
I have missed you.

1673
02:06:31,666 --> 02:06:33,416
So, I'm a prisoner?

1674
02:06:33,500 --> 02:06:35,666
This conversation
has gone down

1675
02:06:35,750 --> 02:06:37,166
an unfortunate route.

1676
02:06:38,208 --> 02:06:40,958
I am sure you will be as happy
as you were before.

1677
02:06:42,291 --> 02:06:44,833
As I was before when
I threw myself from a bridge?

1678
02:06:51,166 --> 02:06:53,875
I suspect you fell
while looking for fish.

1679
02:06:55,583 --> 02:06:56,750
Why would you want
to keep me here

1680
02:06:56,833 --> 02:06:58,250
if I do not wish to stay?

1681
02:06:58,875 --> 02:07:00,791
If one must drown,

1682
02:07:00,875 --> 02:07:03,208
let it be
in the river of love.

1683
02:07:09,500 --> 02:07:10,916
-Mm.

1684
02:07:12,916 --> 02:07:13,916
David,

1685
02:07:15,291 --> 02:07:17,458
does that pheasant
look stripped to the bone?

1686
02:07:17,916 --> 02:07:19,750
It was a misjudgment, sir.

1687
02:07:20,208 --> 02:07:21,208
I apologize.

1688
02:07:30,250 --> 02:07:32,125
Dessert, darling?

1689
02:08:30,416 --> 02:08:32,000
It comes off easy?

1690
02:08:32,083 --> 02:08:33,583
Like a button on a suit.

1691
02:08:34,958 --> 02:08:37,208
I saw them do it in Africa
with sharpened rocks,

1692
02:08:37,291 --> 02:08:41,083
but had my own
more precise device made.

1693
02:08:42,875 --> 02:08:44,208
Do you want just clitoral hood

1694
02:08:44,291 --> 02:08:46,000
or glans as well?

1695
02:08:46,083 --> 02:08:47,958
The whole
infernal packet.

1696
02:08:48,041 --> 02:08:50,041
It will calm her no end.

1697
02:08:50,125 --> 02:08:51,750
This time we will get it done.

1698
02:08:52,416 --> 02:08:53,416
I shall get her sedated

1699
02:08:53,500 --> 02:08:54,708
and bring her
to your surgery this evening.

1700
02:09:05,583 --> 02:09:07,875
Victoria, darling!

1701
02:09:09,291 --> 02:09:10,458
Where are you?

1702
02:09:14,791 --> 02:09:15,791
Oh.

1703
02:09:15,875 --> 02:09:17,250
Perfect timing.

1704
02:09:17,333 --> 02:09:18,375
Martini.

1705
02:09:18,458 --> 02:09:19,708
Rather not.

1706
02:09:20,250 --> 02:09:22,166
I would, however,
like to leave.

1707
02:09:22,625 --> 02:09:24,625
I have found
our time together interesting,

1708
02:09:24,708 --> 02:09:27,375
but I've ascertained
why I jumped from a bridge.

1709
02:09:28,208 --> 02:09:30,750
I wish to go see
my near dead God.

1710
02:09:31,375 --> 02:09:32,416
Adorable idea.

1711
02:09:32,500 --> 02:09:34,083
Unfortunately, my darling,

1712
02:09:34,166 --> 02:09:37,125
my life is dedicated
to the taking of territory.

1713
02:09:37,208 --> 02:09:38,208
You are mine,

1714
02:09:38,291 --> 02:09:40,500
and that is the long
and short of it.

1715
02:09:41,250 --> 02:09:42,666
I am not territory.

1716
02:09:42,750 --> 02:09:46,500
The root of the problem
is between your legs.

1717
02:09:46,583 --> 02:09:47,750
I will have it off

1718
02:09:47,833 --> 02:09:50,750
and it will not distract
and divert you anymore.

1719
02:09:50,833 --> 02:09:52,041
You see, a man spends his life

1720
02:09:52,125 --> 02:09:54,000
wrangling
his sexual compulsions.

1721
02:09:54,083 --> 02:09:57,291
It's a curse and yet,
in some ways, his life's work.

1722
02:09:57,375 --> 02:09:59,416
A woman's life's work
is children.

1723
02:09:59,500 --> 02:10:00,500
I intend to rid you

1724
02:10:00,583 --> 02:10:02,666
of that infernal packet
between your legs

1725
02:10:02,750 --> 02:10:05,000
and plant a seed in you
straight after.

1726
02:10:05,416 --> 02:10:07,500
Let me explain
what has happened.

1727
02:10:07,583 --> 02:10:09,208
Victoria, your wife,

1728
02:10:09,291 --> 02:10:11,500
threw herself
from a bridge and died.

1729
02:10:11,583 --> 02:10:14,708
Godwin Baxter found her,
brought her to his surgery.

1730
02:10:14,791 --> 02:10:16,250
He then removed the baby,

1731
02:10:16,333 --> 02:10:18,000
removed the brain
from the baby,

1732
02:10:18,083 --> 02:10:21,000
transplanted it into my head
and reanimated me.

1733
02:10:21,083 --> 02:10:22,083
-Ah.
-I'll bring you the file.

1734
02:10:22,166 --> 02:10:24,000
It's actually
quite fascinating.

1735
02:10:24,083 --> 02:10:25,958
However,
I will keep my new life

1736
02:10:26,041 --> 02:10:28,500
and my lovely old clitoris,
thank you.

1737
02:10:28,583 --> 02:10:30,208
If you'd call
a carriage for me.

1738
02:10:31,041 --> 02:10:32,791
They talk and talk,
and yet at some point,

1739
02:10:32,875 --> 02:10:34,541
there's nothing left
but to pull a gun.

1740
02:10:35,916 --> 02:10:37,791
'Tis the way with women.

1741
02:10:50,625 --> 02:10:51,625
Are you giving in?

1742
02:10:52,791 --> 02:10:55,833
I'd rather you shot me
in the fucking heart.

1743
02:10:55,916 --> 02:10:58,208
I will oblige if I have to.

1744
02:10:59,833 --> 02:11:01,416
Drink the drink, darling.

1745
02:11:02,250 --> 02:11:03,250
Chloroform and gin.

1746
02:11:13,083 --> 02:11:14,666
In some ways,
it would be a relief

1747
02:11:14,750 --> 02:11:16,875
to be rid of my questing self.

1748
02:11:17,375 --> 02:11:19,833
Sip deeply
and that freedom is yours.

1749
02:11:32,583 --> 02:11:33,583
Fuck.

1750
02:11:48,333 --> 02:11:49,333
Max?

1751
02:11:52,541 --> 02:11:55,625
Max. We have
to get him to surgery.

1752
02:11:56,500 --> 02:11:57,750
He'll die if we don't.

1753
02:11:57,833 --> 02:11:59,000
Bleeding a lot.

1754
02:11:59,083 --> 02:12:01,208
You're fucking dead.

1755
02:12:02,333 --> 02:12:04,000
Uh, Bella, if he lives,

1756
02:12:04,083 --> 02:12:07,541
I do not sense
he is a man who will stop.

1757
02:12:08,041 --> 02:12:09,750
Well, I won't watch him
bleed to death.

1758
02:12:10,291 --> 02:12:12,333
But I agree,
he could do with improvement.

1759
02:12:25,375 --> 02:12:27,375
I've removed the bullet
and stopped the bleeding.

1760
02:12:27,958 --> 02:12:29,291
I have the notes.

1761
02:12:37,375 --> 02:12:39,791
I am never happier
than when I'm in here.

1762
02:13:12,583 --> 02:13:14,000
Bella.

1763
02:13:14,083 --> 02:13:15,375
You're back.

1764
02:13:21,291 --> 02:13:23,750
It was just a story
of someone else,

1765
02:13:24,958 --> 02:13:26,458
not Bella Baxter.

1766
02:13:34,416 --> 02:13:37,375
All my life,
people's eyes looked at me,

1767
02:13:37,458 --> 02:13:39,500
horror, pity...

1768
02:13:41,208 --> 02:13:42,375
but you.

1769
02:13:49,916 --> 02:13:52,000
It's all very interesting...

1770
02:13:54,041 --> 02:13:55,666
what is happening.

1771
02:14:52,333 --> 02:14:53,500
Merci.

1772
02:14:55,541 --> 02:14:57,458
Anatomy exam
is making me nervous.

1773
02:14:57,541 --> 02:15:00,041
I've tested you many times.
You know it.

1774
02:15:01,458 --> 02:15:03,458
No one knows anatomy
better than you.

1775
02:15:08,083 --> 02:15:09,208
Ladies, gin?

1776
02:15:10,083 --> 02:15:11,083
Please.

1777
02:15:11,625 --> 02:15:12,625
Gin?

1778
02:15:15,291 --> 02:15:17,708
We should get some water
for the general.

1779
02:15:23,916 --> 02:15:24,916
Felicity,

1780
02:15:25,958 --> 02:15:26,958
water.
