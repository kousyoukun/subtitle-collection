00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,500
不是。
Ba.

4
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,167
不是！不是！
Ba! Ba!

5
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,583
不不不。
Ba, ba, ba.

6
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:48,500
- 再見。- 嗯，嗯？
- Bye.
- Ba, ba.

7
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:55,458
一堆器官，沒有來自大腦的自我火花…
A pile of organs without the spark of self
from a brain...

8
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,708
或從心臟泵出的血液。
or the pump of blood from a heart.

9
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,708
只是星期日午餐的屠夫托盤。
Just a butcher's tray for a Sunday lunch.

10
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:05,625
現在，誰願意重建器官？
Now, who would like
to reconstruct the organs?

11
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:10,792
如果有差別的話，誰能區分人類和動物呢？
And who can tell human from animal,
if there is a difference?

12
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:14,792
怎樣怎樣。
Come, come.

13
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,833
你小時候有玩過拼圖，不是嗎？
You did puzzles as children, did you not?

14
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,292
只有我這樣，還是在怪物說話時很難集中註意力？
Is it just me, or is it devilishly hard
to concentrate when the monster's talking?

15
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,500
他是一位非凡的外科醫生。
He is an extraordinary surgeon.

16
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:29,583
他的研究具有開創性。他的父親創立了這個地方。
His research is groundbreaking.
His father founded this place.

17
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,500
馬克斯·麥坎德爾斯，您是否誤認為自己參與了這場對話？
Have you mistaken yourself as included
in this conversation, Max McCandles?

18
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,083
您與我們的物理距離並非如此。
Your physical proximity to us
does not make it so.

19
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,667
滾蛋吧，老朋友。給自己買一套西裝吧
Fuck off, old pal. Get yourself a suit.

20
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,667
先生，你真的認為那是肝臟的歸宿嗎？
You really think
that's where the liver goes, sir?

21
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,500
請問先生，把它們放回去的目的是什麼？
Can I ask what is the purpose
of putting them back in, sir?

22
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:51,250
我的樂趣。
My amusement.

23
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,167
馬克斯·麥坎德爾斯先生！
Mr. Max McCandles!

24
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,625
課程結束時和我一起走。
Walk with me at the end of the lesson.

25

你的論文。
Your paper.

26
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,417
先生，您喜歡嗎？
You liked it, sir?

27
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:10,583
它顯示出傳統思維竭力接近平庸的跡象。
It showed signs of a conventional mind
straining hard to almost touch mediocrity.

28
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,417
- 謝謝。- 我需要一個人。一個項目的助理。
- Thank you.
- I need someone. An assistant on a project.

29
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:14,417
我喜歡。
I would love to.

30
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,417
- 你是個有宗教信仰的人嗎？- 我相信上帝。
- Are you a religious man?
- I believe in God.

31
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:20,625
- 我還是神？- 幽默，因為你通常被稱為...
- Me or the deity?
- Humorous, as you're often known as the...

32
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:22,250
這是我自己開的一個玩笑。
It is a joke of my own making.

33
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:24,583
我不需要為我解釋它。
I do not need it explicated for me.

34
00:06:25,292 --> 00:06:26,750
真是魔鬼的傑作。
The very devil's work.

35
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:28,625
先生，您想過留鬍子嗎？
Have you thought of growing a beard, sir?

36
00:06:28,792 --> 00:06:30,917
我看起來像一隻繫著領帶的大狗。
I look like a big dog in a cravat.

37
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,292
孩子們喜歡狗。
Kids like dogs.

38
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:34,042
這個工作。
This job.

39
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,583
是的。來。
Yes. Come.

40
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,167
上帝！上帝。
God! God.

41
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,375
上帝。
God.

42
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,708
- 你好。- 你好。
- Hello.
- Hello.

43
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:12,375
貝拉，這是麥坎德爾斯先生。
Bella, this is Mr. McCandles.

44
00:07:12,542 --> 00:07:14,000
你好，貝拉。
Hello, Bella.

45
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:20,208
- 巴德。- 血。

46
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,625
- 巴德。- 血。

- 血。- 太棒了。
- Blood.
- Marvelous.

48
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:24,667
我很好。我很好。
I'm fine. I'm fine.

49
00:07:29,792 --> 00:07:31,625
多麼漂亮的遲鈍啊。
What a very pretty retard.

50
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,958
她腦部受傷。
She suffered a brain injury.

51
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,333
我修好了。
I repaired it.

52
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,833
她的心理年齡和她的身體不太同步。
Her mental age and her body
are not quite synchronized.

53
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,250
語言來了。她正在以更快的速度進步。
Language is coming.
She is progressing at an accelerated pace.

54
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,708
她令人驚嘆。

55
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:50,917
我需要仔細記錄她的進展。
I need to meticulously note her progression.

56
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,083
你會為我做這件事嗎？

57
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,125
這將是我的榮幸。
It would be my honor.

58
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:55,375
威！
Wee!

59
00:07:56,417 --> 00:07:57,292
威！
Wee!

60
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,458
是的。這很令人興奮，貝拉。
Yes. It is exciting, Bella.

61
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,167
“嗚。” 我相信她正在做...
"Wee." I believe she's doing...

62
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,708
普里姆太太！
Mrs. Prim!

63
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:07,833
韋。
Wee.

64
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,792
你不喜歡醃魚嗎？
Do you not like kippers?

65
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,375
事實上，我很偏愛他們。
I am quite partial to them, actually.

66
00:09:15,542 --> 00:09:19,000
我發現他們早上的樣子很好...
I find them to be nice in the morning...

67
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:42,833
貝拉也剪了？
Bella cut, too?

68
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
對貝拉來說只是死人。
Just dead ones for Bella.

69
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,000
剛剛死了。
Just dead.

70
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:47,333
剛剛死了。
Just dead.

71
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,833
剛剛死了。
Just dead.

72
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,292
壓扁！壓扁，壓扁。
Squish! Squish, squish.

73
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:14,875
時間！
Chog!

74
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,083
時間！
Chog!

75

76
00:10:23,042 --> 00:10:24,042
什麼時候
Chog.

77
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,083
她每天收集 15 個單字。
She gathers 15 words a day.

78
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,583
她的協調性充其量也不穩定。
Her coordination is unstable at best.

79
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,333
到了晚上，就有進步了。
In the evenings, there's progress.

80
00:10:50,792 --> 00:10:53,167
她的頭髮每兩天長長一吋。

81
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,333
- 我這裡有一張頭髮圖。- 出色的。

82
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,250
你可以走了。明天見。
You may go. See you tomorrow.

83
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:01,250
先生，她從哪裡來？
Sir, where did she come from?

84
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:05,000
我相信你的工作就是收集數據。
I believe your job is collecting data.

85
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:08,583
當我添加一些愚蠢的問題時，我會讓你知道。
When I add inane questions to it,
I'll let you know.

86
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,125
「所以，當他們從樹林裡回來時...

87
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:19,917
「她與她的媽媽和爸爸團聚了。
"she was reunited with her Mummy and Daddy.

「那天晚上，晚餐時，他們吃了蛋糕，直到生病為止。
"That night, for dinner,

89
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:29,625
“他們很高興能重新聚在一起。”
"They were so happy to be back together."

90
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,417
你是我爸爸嗎，上帝？

91
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,583
- 我... - 波麗姆說你不是。

- Prim say you not be.

92
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,042
貝拉無處可去的女孩。
Bella nowhere girl.

93
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,875
那是哪裡？無處？
Where that be? Nowhere?

94
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,208
你是個孤兒。
You are an orphan.

95
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:48,375
你的父母死了。
Your parents died.

96
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,458
然後你就砍掉了父母，上帝？
Then you cut parents up, God?

97
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:53,500
不。
No.

98
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,042
他們是我的朋友。
They were my friends.

99
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,583
他們是勇敢的探險家...
They were brave explorers...

100
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,667
他們在南美洲的山崩中喪生。
and they were killed in a landslide
in South America.

101
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,958
他們突破了已知的界限......
They pushed the boundaries
of what was known...

102
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,875
他們付出了代價。
and they paid the price.

103
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:13,750
但這是唯一的生活方式，貝拉。
But that is the only way to live, Bella.

104
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,917
他們把你送到我這裡來照顧你。
They sent you to me to care for you.

105
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,333
死的？
Dead?

106
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,750
恐怕是這樣，親愛的。
I'm afraid so, my darling.

107
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,042
可憐的貝拉。
Poor Bella.

108
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:31,583
但愛神。
But love God.

00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,708
在這裡睡。

晚安，親愛的貝拉。

秘魯，是的。
Peru, yes.

114
00:13:06,042 --> 00:13:08,125
為什麼你要寫下每一篇堅果？
Why you pen book every nut?

115
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:10,458
我必須記下你的營養攝取量。

116
00:13:16,417 --> 00:13:17,750
多少？

00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,833
告訴貝拉其他地方。
Tell Bella other places.

118
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,333
那是葡萄牙的里斯本。
That's Lisbon, Portugal.

119
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,250
法國南部。阿爾卑斯山。
The south of France. The Alps.

120
00:13:36,542 --> 00:13:37,875
澳大利亞。
Australia.

121
00:13:38,042 --> 00:13:40,958
對人和動物來說，都是遙遠而危險的。
Far away and dangerous,
in both people and animal.

122
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,292
貝拉想要看看這個世界。

123
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,125
只是...
Just...

貝拉。
Bella.

125
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,333
貝拉，我認為我們不被允許來這裡。
Bella, I don't think we're allowed up here.

126
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,542
讓我們...

127
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:14,417
貝拉。
Bella.

128
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,500
貝拉。

貝拉，這很危險。
Bella, this is dangerous.

131
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,750
貝拉。
Bella.

00:14:44,042 --> 00:14:45,292
不，貝拉。
No, Bella.

133
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:06,583
上帝。

必須去外面。
Outside must go.

135

外部？不，我們工作。
Outside? No, we work.

136
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:15,750
割傷手指？
Cut fingers?

137
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,958
蠟燭帶我走。蠟燭。
Candles take me.

138
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,375
當然，我可以。如果...

139
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:20,708
不。
No.

是的。出去！

00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,000
不。
No.

143
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:28,792
我為貝拉創造了一個完美有趣且安全的世界。
I have created a perfectly entertaining
and safe world for Bella.

144
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:30,333
現在。
Now.

145
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,250
- 貝拉。- 現在！
- Bella.
- Now!

146
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,292
現在！
Now!

147
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:38,375
貝拉。
Bella.

148
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,667
你知道，外面有很多東西會殺死你，貝拉。
You know, so many things outside
can kill you, Bella.

149
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:10,667
殺死了？
Kill dead?

150
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,958
蛇、馬車、尖臉鳥、地震…
Snakes, carriages, sharp-faced birds,
earthquakes...

151
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,583
吸入有毒草籽。
inhalation of toxic grass seeds.

152
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,417
貝拉。
Bella.

153
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:46,958
貝拉。
Bella.

154
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,250
貝拉。看。
Bella. Look.

155
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,416
- 殺了它。- 什麼？
- Kill it.
- What?

156
00:17:35,792 --> 00:17:37,667
為什麼你的大拇指很滑稽，上帝？
Why you funny thumbs, God?

157
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,583
有一次，當我很小的時候...
Once when I was very small...

158
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,625
我父親把我的大拇指釘在一個小鐵盒裡…
my father pinned my thumbs
into a small iron case...

159
00:17:48,792 --> 00:17:51,917
看看他是否可以延緩骨骼的生長週期。
to see whether he could retard
the growth cycle of bones.

160
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,708
現在，痛苦是如此之大…
Now, the pain was so great...

161
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,000
為了不讓自己哭泣...
to stop myself from weeping...

162
00:17:58,167 --> 00:18:01,208
我會深深地凝視著我的其他手指......
I would stare deeply into my other fingers...

163
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,042
並簡單地透過觀察...
and simply by observation...

164
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,333
開始解析流行病學要素。
begin to parse out
the epidemiological elements.

165
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,750
當他回來時...
When he came back...

166
00:18:10,917 --> 00:18:14,042
令他驚訝的是，我在微笑。
to his surprise, I was smiling.

167
00:18:15,917 --> 00:18:16,875
天哪。
Good God.

168
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:20,292
他是一個思想非傳統的人。
He was a man of unconventional mind.

169
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,583
該走了。
Time to go.

170
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,625
暴風雨即將來臨。
A storm approaches.

171
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,833
為什麼要這麼嚇唬她？
Why must you scare her so?

172
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,208
她是個實驗品...
She's an experiment...

173
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,083
我必須控制條件...
and I must control the conditions...

174
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,500
否則我們的結果將不純淨。
or our results will not be pure.

175
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,125
停止！天哪，我們走吧！
Stop!
God, we go!

176
00:19:00,292 --> 00:19:01,250
不，貝拉。
No, Bella.

177
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:03,000
貝拉想要在冰淇淋中散步。
Bella want walk in ice cream.

178
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:04,000
不。
No.

179
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:05,375
貝拉想要！
Bella wants!

180
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:07,875
我的臉。人們害怕上帝。
My face. People scared of God.

181
00:19:08,042 --> 00:19:08,917
嘲笑上帝。
Laugh at God.

182
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,375
上帝可愛。
God lovely.

183
00:19:10,542 --> 00:19:11,875
像狗臉一樣。
Like dog face.

184
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,417
相當。
Quite.

185
00:19:16,292 --> 00:19:17,708
- 停止！我走。- 不！
- Stop! Me walk.
- No!

186
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,000
不是現在？沒有永不？
No now? No never?

187
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:24,875
就是不行。
Just no.

188
00:19:32,417 --> 00:19:34,792
- 漂亮的！- 不！
- Bella!
- No!

189
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,583
- 不！不！不！- 漂亮的！
- No! No! No!
- Bella!

190
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:40,208
不！
No!

191
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,833
- 對不起。對不起。- 不！
- Sorry. Sorry.
- No!

192
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,417
不！不！
No! No!

193
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,083
對不起，親愛的。
I'm sorry, my darling.

194
00:20:06,417 --> 00:20:07,833
聖母瑪利亞。
Mother of God.

195
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,500
你對她做了什麼？
What did you do to her?

196
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,417
為什麼要躲著她？
Why are you hiding her?

197
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,083
告訴我這一切意味著什麼，否則我就去報警。
Tell me what all this means,
or I'll go to the police.

198
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:50,167
我將。因為這是一個快樂的故事。
I shall. For it is a happy tale.

199
00:22:08,042 --> 00:22:11,875
很難得到一具屍體，雖然已經死了，卻如此接近生命。
It is rare to get a body,
albeit dead, but so close to life.

200
00:22:12,042 --> 00:22:14,542
嚴格性還沒出現。
Rigor had not set in.

201
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,208
身體幾乎還沒有冷卻。
The body had hardly cooled.

202
00:22:17,917 --> 00:22:19,250
無脈搏。
No pulse.

203
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:22,875
但有一些電流，所以我可以讓她活下去。
But some electric currents,
so I could have kept her alive.

204
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:24,292
但你沒有。
But you didn't.

205
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,167
我對她所放棄的生活一無所知......
I knew nothing of the life
she had abandoned...

206
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:32,125
只是她太討厭它了，所以她選擇不…
except she hated it so much
that she had chosen not to be...

207
00:22:32,292 --> 00:22:33,375
永遠。
and forever.

208
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,125
她會有什麼感覺…
What would she feel...

209
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:40,500
被從她精心挑選的空白永恆中拖出來…
on being dragged
from her carefully chosen blank eternity...

210
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:43,500
並被迫被安置在我們人手不足的一間...
and forced to be put
in one of our understaffed...

211
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:47,458
設備簡陋的瘋人院、管教所或監獄？
poorly-equipped madhouses,
reformatories or jails?

212
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:53,417
因為在這個基督教國家，自殺被視為精神錯亂或犯罪。
For in this Christian nation,
suicide is treated as lunacy or crime.

213
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:55,958
我是誰來決定她的命運？
Who was I to decide her fate?

214
00:22:56,583 --> 00:23:00,167
但對我來說，也有一種認可。
But then there was also, on my part,
a recognition.

215
00:23:00,792 --> 00:23:03,292
我所有的研究都到了這一刻。
All my research had come to this moment.

216
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:06,042
命運帶給我了一具屍體…
Fate had brought me a dead body...

217
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:07,208
和一個活生生的嬰兒。
and a live infant.

218
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:08,625
這是顯而易見的。
It was obvious.

219
00:23:08,792 --> 00:23:09,708
它是？
It was?

220
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,375
把嬰兒的大腦取出...
Take the infant's brain out...

221
00:23:11,542 --> 00:23:14,792
然後把它放進成年女人體內，讓她復活，然後觀察。
and put it in the full-grown woman,
reanimate her, and watch.

222
00:23:15,417 --> 00:23:16,667
耶穌！
Jesus!

223
00:24:09,167 --> 00:24:10,542
她知道？
She knows?

224
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:11,958
不。
No.

225
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,000
她是誰？
Who was she?

226
00:24:13,542 --> 00:24:14,625
不知道。
No idea.

227
00:24:15,917 --> 00:24:18,958
但你寧願這個世界沒有貝拉嗎？
But would you rather
the world did not have Bella?

228
00:26:58,625 --> 00:26:59,708
普里姆太太？
Mrs. Prim?

229
00:27:00,583 --> 00:27:02,583
貝拉在她想要的時候發現快樂。
Bella discover happy when she want.

230
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:06,792
你是一張臭臉，但我會修復你。
You are a sour face, but I fix you.

231
00:27:08,292 --> 00:27:09,417
閉上眼睛。
Close eyes.

232
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:14,917
- 不！- 等等。這需要一點時間。
- No!
- Just wait. It takes a moment.

233
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,417
她搶走了我的生意。
She grabbed my hairy business.

234
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:19,875
她病了！
She's sick!

235
00:27:20,042 --> 00:27:20,875
貝拉。
Bella.

236
00:27:21,042 --> 00:27:23,083
貝拉發現了一些我必須分享的東西。
Bella have discover something I must share.

237
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,083
手錶。
Watch.

238
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:27,083
- 如果把黃瓜放進我體內會怎麼樣？- 不。
- What if put cucumber in me?
- No.

239
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:30,375
漂亮的！漂亮的！
Bella! Bella!

240
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:33,500
立即停止工作。
Cease working yourself immediately.

241
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:34,500
什麼？
What?

242
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:37,542
在上流社會，人們並沒有這麼做。
In polite society, that is not done.

243
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:44,000
只是不這樣做。
Just do not.

244
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,625
那是什麼？
What... is that?

245
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:59,500
我父親取出了我的催酸腺和幽門腺...
My father took out
my oxyntic and pyloric glands...

246
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:02,208
所以我必須自己做胃液。
so I must make my own gastric juices.

247
00:28:02,792 --> 00:28:04,125
看在上帝的份上，他為什麼要這麼做？
Why in God's name would he do that?

248
00:28:04,292 --> 00:28:06,708
去發現無人知曉的事。
To discover what no one knew.

249
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:09,500
事實證明我們需要它們。理想情況下。
Turns out we need them. Ideally.

250
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,292
貝拉…
Bella...

251
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:14,750
你還沒吃過。
you have not eaten.

252
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:17,708
不要。
Do not.

253
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:27,250
晚安。
Good night.

254
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:29,708
'夜晚。
'Night.

255
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:52,125
你知道，我其實是一個浪漫的人，麥克斯。
You know, I'm actually
something of a romantic, Max.

256
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:53,667
什麼？
What?

257
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:56,500
我相信我看到了你和貝拉之間的愛。
I believe I see love between you and Bella.

258
00:28:58,167 --> 00:28:59,458
我……她是……
I... She is...

259
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:02,083
也許你應該娶她。
Perhaps you should marry her.

260
00:29:02,417 --> 00:29:03,250
什麼？
What?

261
00:29:03,417 --> 00:29:04,750
我想她愛你。
I think she loves you.

262
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:10,375
我看過人們彼此充滿愛意地看著對方
I've seen people look at each other
with love...

263
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:11,583
作為觀察者。
as an observer.

264
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,875
當然不是主題。我看到了。
Not the subject, of course. I see it.

265
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:16,333
你做？
You do?

266
00:29:18,042 --> 00:29:18,875
我...
I...

267
00:29:19,417 --> 00:29:22,208
我對她確實有感情。
I do have feelings for her.

268
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:23,917
那麼，你願意嗎？
So, you would?

269
00:29:24,708 --> 00:29:26,667
帶貝拉出去。
Take Bella out.

270
00:29:27,917 --> 00:29:28,958
貝拉…
Bella...

271
00:29:30,958 --> 00:29:31,833
我...
I...

272
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:35,708
覺得好笑嗎？
Feel funny?

273
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:43,167
做貝拉吧
Do Bella.

274
00:29:49,458 --> 00:29:51,333
我想知道...
I was wondering...

275
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,917
如果也許你正在撫養她成為你的情婦。
if perhaps you were raising her
to be your mistress.

276
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,417
我知道，這是一個不值得我的黑暗想法。
A dark thought unworthy of me, I know.

277
00:29:57,667 --> 00:30:00,833
那麼，你不跟她上床了嗎？
So, you are not laying with her?

278
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:06,208
精子射精只能誘導我的體內平衡...
Spermatic ejaculation can only induce
homeostasis in me...

279
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:10,375
如果伴隨著對高級神經中樞的長時間刺激...
if accompanied by prolonged stimulation
of higher nerve centers...

280
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:14,458
它對無導管腺體的壓力改變了我血液的化學成分...
whose pressure on the ductless glands
changes the chemistry of my blood...

281
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:16,750
不是幾分鐘的痙攣…
not for a few spasmodic minutes...

282
00:30:16,917 --> 00:30:18,250
但很多天了。
but for many days.

283
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,625
什麼？
What?

284
00:30:20,792 --> 00:30:23,042
我是太監，不能幹她。
I am a eunuch and can't fuck her.

285
00:30:23,417 --> 00:30:26,250
為了讓我的身體產生性反應...
To get a sexual response from my body...

286
00:30:26,417 --> 00:30:30,083
所需的電量與倫敦北部的運轉電量相同。
would take the same amount of electricity
as runs North London.

287
00:30:30,792 --> 00:30:33,500
另外，我的父愛之情…
Besides, my paternal feelings...

288
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:36,042
似乎超過了我的性想法。
seem to outweigh my sexual thoughts.

289
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,375
我為自己的陰暗想法道歉。
I apologize for my own dark thoughts.

290
00:30:40,542 --> 00:30:41,583
一點也不黑。
Not dark at all.

291
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:45,917
男人的性行為，事實上所有的性行為，基本上都是不道德的。
Men's, indeed all sexuality,
is basically immoral.

292
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:47,875
不是全部，先生。
Not all, sir.

293
00:30:48,042 --> 00:30:49,833
你想不想娶她？
Do you wish to marry her or not?

294
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:54,083
我想嫁給你。做我的妻子吧。
I wish to marry you. Be my wife.

295
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,458
讓我們觸摸彼此的生殖器。
Let us touch each other's genital pieces.

296
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:06,042
不，不。
No. No.

297
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:08,292
我不想利用你。
I do not wish to take advantage of you.

298
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:09,583
你很特別。
You are special.

299
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,417
當我們結婚的時候。
When we are wed.

300
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:19,375
一個條件。
One condition.

301
00:31:19,542 --> 00:31:22,167
她一定也渴望它，我明白。
She must desire it also, I understand.

302
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:23,875
那麼有兩個條件。
Two conditions, then.

303
00:31:24,042 --> 00:31:25,250
你說的那個...
That one you said...

304
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:29,250
你必須永遠和我住在這裡。
and you must live here with me, always.

305
00:31:30,583 --> 00:31:33,250
我將起草一份法律協議。
I will have a legal agreement drawn up.

306
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:00,667
奇怪的合約。
Curious contract.

307
00:32:00,833 --> 00:32:02,750
有幾個拼字錯誤。
There are several spelling errors.

308
00:32:03,792 --> 00:32:07,083
我向你保證，這與它的法律約束力無關。
Immaterial to the legal bindingness of it,
I assure you.

309
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:13,000
必須是一位非常女性才能保證這樣的束縛。
Must be quite a woman
to warrant such binding.

310
00:32:17,833 --> 00:32:20,000
請原諒，我需要使用這些設施。
If you'll excuse me,
I need to use the facilities.

311
00:32:21,792 --> 00:32:24,458
你五歲了還不能控制水嗎？
Are you five years old
that you can't hold your water?

312
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:29,125
先生，膀胱無力。就像我之前的父親和他之前的父親一樣。
Weak bladder, sir.
Like my father before me and his before him.

313
00:32:29,292 --> 00:32:31,708
您可能患有前列腺癌。了解更多。
You may have prostate cancer. Look into it.

314
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,500
會做。
Will do.

315
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:42,500
貝拉·巴克斯特女士，毫無疑問，按照您的合約。
Ms. Bella Baxter, as per your contract,
no doubt.

316
00:33:43,292 --> 00:33:45,250
下午好，來訪的人。
Good afternoon, visiting man.

317
00:33:46,208 --> 00:33:47,292
想要我的帽子嗎？
Want my hat?

318
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:49,417
它適合我嗎？
Would it suit me?

319
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:51,083
是的。
Yes.

320
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:54,083
這是愚蠢的好事。
It is foolish good.

321
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:55,375
我必須要見見這個女人...
I had to meet this woman...

322
00:33:55,542 --> 00:33:59,167
誰會促成這樣一份囚禁她的婚約。
who would inspire such a contract of marriage
that imprisons her.

323
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:01,250
你是什​​麼意思？
What you mean?

324
00:34:01,417 --> 00:34:02,375
你將住在這裡...
You shall live here...

325
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:05,833
與 Max McCandles 先生和 Baxter 先生一起出國旅行...
travel with Mr. Max McCandles
and Baxter abroad...

326
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,875
但不去城裡。
but not go forth in the city.

327
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:09,708
我懂了。
I see.

328
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:12,083
他們緊緊地愛著我。
They love me tight.

329
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,750
我明白為什麼。
I understand why.

330
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:15,958
我得掐你一下，看看你是不是真的。
I have to pinch you, to see if you are real.

331
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:17,125
你不會...
You will not...

332
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,000
你是誰？
Who is you?

333
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,750
鄧肯‧韋德伯恩先生。
Mr. Duncan Wedderburn.

334
00:34:57,625 --> 00:34:58,458
打開。
Open.

335
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,292
你怎麼爬到這裡來了？
How you get up here?

336
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:13,500
我爬。
I climbed.

337
00:35:32,417 --> 00:35:33,792
你監視我很久了？
You were watch me long?

338
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:35,250
不久。
Not long.

339
00:35:35,417 --> 00:35:38,833
你沒有看到我透過自己的努力來獲得幸福，對嗎？
You did not see me working on myself
to get happiness, did you?

340
00:35:39,917 --> 00:35:41,958
我知道這不是禮貌。
It is not polites, I know.

341
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:49,333
不關心上流社會。
Do not care for polite society.

342
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,625
真他媽無聊。
It's fucking boring.

343
00:35:51,417 --> 00:35:52,750
摧毀一個人的靈魂。
Destroys one's soul.

344
00:35:53,875 --> 00:35:55,375
上帝不相信靈魂。
God not believe in soul.

345
00:35:56,833 --> 00:36:00,042
我認為上帝是靈魂觀念的真正創造者。
I think God's the actual author
of the soul idea.

346
00:36:00,542 --> 00:36:02,083
戈德溫·巴克斯特？
Godwin Baxter?

347
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,042
那隻被燒死的狗。
That burnt dog.

348
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:05,750
那是什麼故事？
What is that story?

349
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:09,167
你是一名囚犯，我的目標是釋放你。
You are a prisoner and I aim to free you.

350
00:36:11,542 --> 00:36:14,125
你內在的某些東西，一些飢餓的存在...
Something in you, some hungry being...

351
00:36:14,292 --> 00:36:17,000
渴望體驗、自由、觸摸。
hungry for experience, freedom, touch.

352
00:36:17,167 --> 00:36:19,250
看到未知並認識它。
To see the unknown and know it.

353
00:36:20,042 --> 00:36:22,375
那麼，你問我為什麼在這裡？
So, why am I here, you ask?

354
00:36:23,542 --> 00:36:26,583
我周五要去里斯本。我希望你能來。
I'm going to Lisbon on Friday.
I'd like you to come.

355
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,375
葡萄牙里斯本？
Lisbon of Portugal?

356
00:36:28,542 --> 00:36:30,583
這就是我所說的里斯本。
That is the Lisbon I speak of.

357
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,500
上帝絕對不允許。
God never allow it.

358
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,708
這就是為什麼我不問他。
That's why I'm not asking him.

359
00:36:39,375 --> 00:36:40,583
我在問你。
I'm asking you.

360
00:36:42,792 --> 00:36:44,958
我想貝拉和你在一起並不安全。
Bella not safe with you, I think.

361
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:48,292
你絕對……不是。
You are absolutely... not.

362
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:06,708
親愛的上帝，可以給我一段寶貴的時間嗎？
May I have a moment of value time, dear God?

363
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:08,167
當然，貝拉。
Of course, Bella.

364
00:37:08,333 --> 00:37:10,917
我想告訴你一個大消息。
I wanted to tell you big news.

365
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:13,167
貝拉興奮得頭暈。
Bella is dizzy with excite.

366
00:37:13,583 --> 00:37:14,458
它是什麼？
What is it?

367
00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:16,417
今晚，半夜…
Tonight, at midnight...

368
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:20,708
我和鄧肯‧韋德伯恩偷偷私奔了。
I secretly run away
with one Duncan Wedderburn.

369
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:21,917
什麼？
What?

370
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:23,375
你會想阻止我。
You will wish to stop me.

371
00:37:23,542 --> 00:37:24,542
我會阻止你的。
I shall stop you.

372
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:26,458
你把貝拉抱得太緊了。
You hold Bella too tight.

373
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:28,875
我必須出發進入水域。
I must set forth into waters.

374
00:37:29,042 --> 00:37:30,042
我們可以旅行。
We can travel.

375
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:33,000
你、我和麥克斯，我會提醒你…
You, me, and Max whom,
I will remind you...

376
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,458
你已經訂婚了。
you are betrothed to.

377
00:37:34,625 --> 00:37:36,292
我要嫁給麥斯...
I will marry Max...

378
00:37:36,458 --> 00:37:38,958
因為他似乎適合這樣做...
as he seems right for that...

379
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:42,792
但首先，我要在鄧肯·韋德伯恩 (Duncan Wedderburn) 上冒險…
but first, I shall adventure
on Duncan Wedderburn...

380
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:46,583
我想，誰不在乎我所受的傷害…
who, I think, cares little of damage to me...

381
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:50,333
但也會很有趣。
but will be interesting as well.

382
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,000
我不能讓你走。
I can't let you go.

383
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:00,792
吻我並帶我出去。
Kiss me and set me forth.

384
00:38:01,667 --> 00:38:02,750
如果你不...
If you do not...

385
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:07,167
貝拉的內心將會因仇恨而腐爛。
Bella's insides shall turn rotten with hate.

386
00:38:07,333 --> 00:38:09,542
- 恨？- 恨。
- Hate?
- Hate.

387
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:19,917
打開那些袋子，波麗姆。
Unpack those bags, Prim.

388
00:38:20,083 --> 00:38:21,958
戈德溫已經告訴我你的計畫了。
Godwin has told me your plan.

389
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:23,250
我不怪你，貝拉。
I do not blame you, Bella.

390
00:38:23,417 --> 00:38:25,167
那個人是個無賴和浪子。
That man is a cad and a rake.

391
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:28,125
他用陰險的方式激怒天真的女人。
He has insidious ways
of getting under a naive woman's skin.

392
00:38:28,292 --> 00:38:30,708
主要是他的眼睛看著我。
It is mostly his eyes on mine.

393
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:33,625
當他的手放在貝拉的雙腿之間時...
And his hands when between Bella's legs...

394
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:36,208
並低聲說出我聽不見的話語…
and whisper words I can't hear...

395
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:38,292
但我的身體卻發熱。
but heat in my body.

396
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:39,833
天哪，貝拉。
Jesus, Bella.

397
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,375
我們訂婚了。
We are engaged.

398
00:38:41,542 --> 00:38:42,292
我愛你。
I love you.

399
00:38:42,458 --> 00:38:44,500
等我回來了，我們就結婚了…
And when I return, we marriage...

400
00:38:44,708 --> 00:38:46,792
並像樹枝上的兩隻鴿子一樣快樂。
and be happy as two doves on a branch.

401
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:48,708
- 你認為我需要旅行帽嗎？- 不！
- You think I need travel hat?
- No!

402
00:38:49,375 --> 00:38:50,292
這是不行的。
This will not do.

403
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:52,208
這不行！
It cannot!

404
00:38:52,375 --> 00:38:53,667
我會親自去看看這個人。
I'll see to this man myself.

405
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:58,208
我要把他英俊的臉打成血骨粥！
I will beat his handsome face
into a porridge of blood and bones!

406
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:00,083
麥克斯，你臉紅了…
Max, you are flushed...

407
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,542
我也看到了不同的麥克斯。
and I am too at sight of different Max.

408
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:03,458
我道歉...
I apologize...

409
00:39:03,667 --> 00:39:07,000
但我不會讓一個我認識的人心裡只有惡意…
but I will not let a man that I know
has nothing but ill intent in his mind...

410
00:39:07,167 --> 00:39:09,708
他心裡對你沒有什麼欺騙你的。
and nothing for you in his heart trick you.

411
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:12,667
我要打碎他的頭。
I will smash his fucking head in.

412
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:29,292
貝拉？它...
Bella? It...

413
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:34,667
貝拉。
Bella.

414
00:39:42,958 --> 00:39:45,333
再見，稍後的鴿子。
Goodbye, later dove.

415
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,083
偉大的冒險之後我會見到你。
I will see you after grand adventure.

416
00:39:50,208 --> 00:39:51,042
上帝？
God?

417
00:40:31,875 --> 00:40:32,792
她走了。
She's gone.

418
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:36,333
我早餐吃波特酒。
I am having port for breakfast.

419
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,458
真是奇怪的美味。
It is strangely delicious.

420
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:40,292
為什麼不阻止她？
Why did you not stop her?

421
00:40:41,292 --> 00:40:43,458
她是一個有自由意志的人。
She is a being of free will.

422
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,875
她現在就在外面。獨自的。
She's now out there. Alone.

423
00:40:50,042 --> 00:40:51,917
她會沒事的。
She will be fine.

424
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:54,042
我是一個傻瓜。我應該阻止她的。
I'm a fool. I should have stopped her.

425
00:40:54,208 --> 00:40:56,167
我們是科學人。
We are men of science.

426
00:40:57,208 --> 00:41:00,792
這種情緒化是不恰當的。
This emotionality is unseemly.

427
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:05,917
我只希望她一切都好。
I just hope she's all right.

428
00:41:28,208 --> 00:41:30,583
你是我見過的最美麗的女人。
You are the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

429
00:41:31,333 --> 00:41:33,167
我不會說謊，我和很多人在一起過。
I will not lie, I have been with many.

430
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:37,000
普里姆太太說你是狼，身上有一百個女人的氣味。
Mrs. Prim said you were wolf
with scent of hundred women on you.

431
00:41:37,167 --> 00:41:38,542
她低估了它。
She undersells it.

432
00:41:39,167 --> 00:41:41,667
好的。生蠔。
Okay. Oysters.

433
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,417
你以前吃過嗎？
Have you had them before?

434
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:44,750
我沒有。
I have not.

435
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:51,042
去殼、卡盤和泡沫。
Shuck, chuck and bubble.

436
00:42:02,042 --> 00:42:02,958
歡鬧。
Rollicking.

437
00:42:06,542 --> 00:42:07,708
歡鬧。
Rollicking.

438
00:42:11,458 --> 00:42:12,625
等待。貝拉。
Wait. Bella.

439
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,958
所以，尼姑和僧侶會用蛋白為衣服上漿…
So, nuns and monks would
starch their clothes with egg whites...

440
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:27,292
然後，用蛋黃製作這些餡餅。
and, with the yolks, make these tarts.

441
00:42:27,917 --> 00:42:29,000
現在，怎麼吃它們呢？
Now, how to eat them?

442
00:42:29,167 --> 00:42:30,792
我會透過嘴巴猜測。
I will guess through the mouth.

443
00:42:30,958 --> 00:42:33,875
他們不可以一片一片地吃下去…
They must not be eaten
dainty flake by dainty flake...

444
00:42:34,042 --> 00:42:36,917
但卻充滿熱情地吸入，就像生命本身一樣。
but inhaled with gusto, like life itself.

445
00:42:43,375 --> 00:42:44,667
極好的。
Incredible.

446
00:42:45,792 --> 00:42:47,667
這些是誰做的？我們需要更多。
Who made these?
We need more.

447
00:42:47,917 --> 00:42:50,375
不再。一個就夠了 再多就太多了。
No more. One's enough.
Any more is too much.

448
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:52,708
午睡時間到了。
It's siesta time.

449
00:42:52,875 --> 00:42:54,458
什麼是午睡？
What is siesta?

450
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:23,792
為什麼人們不這樣做...
Why do people not just do this...

451
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:25,250
每時每刻？
all the time?

452
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,083
好吧，冒著不謙虛的風險...
Well, at the risk of being immodest...

453
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:32,083
你剛剛被最好的人操過三次。
you've just been thrice fucked
by the very best.

454
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:35,042
很可能沒有其他人能讓你達到我所擁有的狂喜。
It's probable no other man
would ever bring you to the raptures I have.

455
00:43:36,792 --> 00:43:37,958
我為你感到傷心。
I feel bad for you.

456
00:43:39,542 --> 00:43:43,042
好吧，那我就只能和你一起瘋狂地跳躍了。
Well, then it will just be you
I do furious jumping with.

457
00:43:43,917 --> 00:43:45,417
狂暴跳躍？
Furious jumping?

458
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:47,167
我喜歡那個。
I love that.

459
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,000
我休息了。
I'm rested.

460
00:43:49,792 --> 00:43:50,833
讓我們再出發吧。
Let us go again.

461
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,125
再一次？
Again?

462
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:54,375
很遺憾...
Unfortunately...

463
00:43:54,542 --> 00:43:56,083
即使我也有我的極限。
even I have my limits.

464
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,542
男人不能總是回來索取更多。
Men cannot keep coming back for more.

465
00:43:58,708 --> 00:44:00,917
這是生理問題嗎？
It is a physiological problem?

466
00:44:01,667 --> 00:44:03,125
男人的弱點？
A weakness in men?

467
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,500
出色地...
Well...

468
00:44:07,833 --> 00:44:09,292
也許是這樣。
Perhaps so.

469
00:44:10,833 --> 00:44:12,792
如果還不算太晚的話，我會建議您...
You'd be advised,
if it's not too late...

470
00:44:12,958 --> 00:44:14,708
不要愛上我。
not to fall in love with me.

471
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,833
我能提供的東西很少...
I have very little to offer...

472
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,708
以恆常之道。
in the way of constancy.

473
00:44:18,917 --> 00:44:20,042
只是冒險。
Just adventure.

474
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:21,375
我懂了。
I see.

475
00:44:22,917 --> 00:44:24,042
讓我們睡吧。
Let us sleep.

476
00:44:52,792 --> 00:44:53,792
出租車，女士？
Taxi, madam?

477
00:48:34,458 --> 00:48:35,417
晚安...
Good evening...

478
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:38,208
鄧肯·韋德伯恩。
Duncan Wedderburn.

479
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:40,750
貝拉，你在哪裡？你消失了。
Bella, where were you? You disappeared.

480
00:48:41,458 --> 00:48:42,667
我沒有。
I did not.

481
00:48:43,417 --> 00:48:45,375
沒有人可以憑空消失。
Nobody can just disappear.

482
00:48:45,875 --> 00:48:46,833
什麼？
What?

483
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,625
他們可以嗎？消失？
Can they? Disappear?

484
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:51,792
不，當然不是。你他媽在說什麼…
No, of course not.
What the fuck are you talking...

485
00:48:51,958 --> 00:48:52,875
當時你在哪裡？
Where were you?

486
00:48:53,042 --> 00:48:56,708
我想要一個餡餅，然後一次冒險降臨到我身上。
I wanted a tart
and then an adventure befell me.

487
00:48:56,875 --> 00:48:59,792
我不知道如何返回，然後我聽到了。
I did not know how to return
and then I heard it.

488
00:48:59,958 --> 00:49:00,792
電車。
The tram.

489
00:49:00,958 --> 00:49:03,708
我將走到噪音處，然後我找到了它。
I will walk to the noise, and I found it.

490
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:05,375
讓貝拉驚訝不已。
Amazement to Bella.

491
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:07,000
我體內流著探險家的血液。
Explorer bloods in me.

492
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,042
貝拉，不帶我出去很危險。
Bella, it's dangerous to go out without me.

493
00:49:09,208 --> 00:49:12,458
我冒險過，但除了糖和暴力之外什麼也沒發現。
I have adventured it
and found nothing but sugar and violence.

494
00:49:12,625 --> 00:49:14,125
這是最迷人的。
It is most charming.

495
00:49:14,292 --> 00:49:15,375
我沒事。
I am fine.

496
00:49:16,042 --> 00:49:20,042
現在，我必須躺下，你也必須躺在我身上，進行更猛烈的跳躍。
Now, I must lie down and you must lie down
on top of me and do more furious jumping.

497
00:49:24,167 --> 00:49:24,958
貓咪。
Kitty.

498
00:49:26,167 --> 00:49:28,542
你看過王爾德在倫敦的新劇嗎？
Did you see the new show in London by Wilde?

499
00:49:28,708 --> 00:49:29,917
非常機智。
Marvelously witty.

500
00:49:30,083 --> 00:49:31,208
我愛它。
I loved it.

501
00:49:31,375 --> 00:49:32,958
“一個手提包。”
"A handbag."

502
00:49:37,667 --> 00:49:38,625
貝拉。
Bella.

503
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:40,958
什麼？
What?

504
00:49:42,292 --> 00:49:45,125
如果它令人反感，為什麼我要把它留在嘴裡？
Why I keep it in my mouth if it is revolting?

505
00:49:45,708 --> 00:49:47,875
我之前曾對傑拉德說過這句話。
I have said that before to Gerald.

506
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:51,667
如果你明白我的意思。
If you catch my drift.

507
00:49:52,958 --> 00:49:54,250
你是邪惡的。
You are wicked.

508
00:49:54,417 --> 00:49:56,458
哦。因為你指的是他的陰莖。
Oh. Because you mean his penis.

509
00:49:58,833 --> 00:50:00,708
鄧肯的有時會很鹹。
Duncan's can sometimes be salty.

510
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:05,708
天啊，貝拉。
Good God, Bella.

511
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:09,250
我必須去打那個孩子。
I must go punch that baby.

512
00:50:13,958 --> 00:50:14,792
貝拉。
Bella.

513
00:50:19,708 --> 00:50:22,000
你的行為是不合情理的。
Your behavior is unconscionable.

514
00:50:22,167 --> 00:50:23,292
你會表現得好嗎？
Will you behave?

515
00:50:23,458 --> 00:50:25,625
食物卡住了我的喉嚨…
The food was cacking my throat...

516
00:50:25,792 --> 00:50:27,292
寶寶煩人...
the baby annoying...

517
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:29,708
女人的言語令人厭煩。
and the woman boring with words.

518
00:50:29,875 --> 00:50:31,042
你將重新加入餐桌...
You will rejoin the table...

519
00:50:31,208 --> 00:50:34,000
並將自己限制在以下三個短語中...
and will confine yourself
to the following three phrases...

520
00:50:34,167 --> 00:50:36,333
「太棒了！」、「高興極了」…
"How marvelous!", "Delighted"...

521
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:40,125
以及“他們是怎麼把糕點做得這麼脆的？” 是的？
and "How did they make the pastry so crisp?"
Yes?

522
00:50:40,792 --> 00:50:42,250
你傷害了貝拉。
You are hurting Bella.

523
00:50:42,417 --> 00:50:43,667
對不起。
Sorry.

524
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:45,792
理性無法滲透。
Reason does not penetrate.

525
00:50:45,958 --> 00:50:46,750
讓我們去。
Let us go.

526
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:06,833
貝拉，你喜歡里斯本嗎？
Are you enjoying Lisbon, Bella?

527
00:51:08,958 --> 00:51:09,917
高興極了。
Delighted.

528
00:51:12,042 --> 00:51:14,500
凱蒂，你親愛的爸爸怎麼樣？
Kitty, how is your dear father?

529
00:51:15,083 --> 00:51:16,000
他身體很不好。
He's very unwell.

530
00:51:16,708 --> 00:51:18,500
我擔心他今年都看不到了。
I fear he will not see the year out.

531
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:19,958
多麼奇妙。
How marvelous.

532
00:51:20,583 --> 00:51:22,542
他們是怎麼把糕點做得這麼脆的呢？
How did they get the pastry so crisp?

533
00:51:41,583 --> 00:51:42,750
天哪。
Good God.

534
00:51:43,583 --> 00:51:44,667
它是什麼？
What is it?

535
00:51:45,792 --> 00:51:46,875
從她。
From her.

536
00:51:50,208 --> 00:51:52,625
「我很好。里斯本。
"Me good. Lisbon.

537
00:51:53,125 --> 00:51:56,083
“糖塔舔我一整天。”
"Sugar tart lick me all day."

538
00:51:57,625 --> 00:51:59,583
無論如何，至少我希望這只是一句話。
At least I hope
that's all one sentence, anyway.

539
00:52:00,042 --> 00:52:00,792
- 你認為他們是... - 他媽的？
- Do you think they're...
- Fucking?

540
00:52:00,958 --> 00:52:01,792
是的。
Yes.

541
00:52:03,417 --> 00:52:04,208
也...
Also...

542
00:52:04,917 --> 00:52:06,292
{\an8}砍伐一輛電車。
fellating a tram.

543
00:53:19,042 --> 00:53:22,292
鄧肯‧韋德伯恩，妳的頭也痛嗎？
Does your head ache too, Duncan Wedderburn?

544
00:53:22,458 --> 00:53:24,917
而且我也餓了，想吃晚餐了。
And I also am starving for dinner.

545
00:53:25,083 --> 00:53:26,667
你他媽的在哪裡？
Where the fuck were you?

546
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,792
維多利亞·布萊辛頓？
Victoria Blessington?

547
00:53:33,292 --> 00:53:35,167
我已經好幾年沒見到你了。
I haven't seen you for years.

548
00:53:35,333 --> 00:53:37,125
而你還沒有...
And you still have not...

549
00:53:37,292 --> 00:53:39,625
因為我是貝拉·巴克斯特…
as I am Bella Baxter...

550
00:53:39,792 --> 00:53:41,500
奇怪的羽毛女士。
strange feathered lady.

551
00:53:41,667 --> 00:53:44,417
我道歉。我可以發誓你就是她。
I apologize. I could've sworn you were she.

552
00:53:49,417 --> 00:53:50,417
正確的。
Right.

553
00:53:50,583 --> 00:53:51,792
我們可以？
Shall we?

554
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,208
牛排、魚…
The steak, the fish...

555
00:53:55,375 --> 00:53:57,500
罐子裡的小焦糖東西...
little caramel things in pots...

556
00:53:57,667 --> 00:54:00,083
那邊的老斑點人都有。
that old spotted people over there have.

557
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:01,917
我不想在罐子裡放焦糖。
I don't want caramel in pots.

558
00:54:02,292 --> 00:54:04,500
當然不是。這就是貝拉的全部了。
Of course not. That was all for Bella.

559
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,125
隨心所欲地訂購。
Order at your whim.

560
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:10,625
你對貝拉的郊遊和冒險很生氣。
You are cross
at Bella's outings and adventures.

561
00:54:10,792 --> 00:54:12,958
然而我們必須突發奇想地發現...
And yet we must discover by whim...

562
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:16,000
正如鄧肯·韋德伯恩 (Duncan Wedderburn) 對貝拉·巴克斯特 (Bella Baxter) 所說…
as spoken by Duncan Wedderburn
to Bella Baxter...

563
00:54:16,208 --> 00:54:17,708
里斯本戀情的第一天。
day one of Lisbon love affair.

564
00:54:18,542 --> 00:54:19,292
觸碰。
Touché.

565
00:54:19,458 --> 00:54:21,750
請理解我從未在上帝的家之外生活過。
Understand me never lived
outside God's house.

566
00:54:21,917 --> 00:54:22,625
什麼？
What?

567
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:25,167
所以，貝拉有太多的發現...
So, Bella so much to discover...

568
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:27,500
還有你悲傷的臉...
and your sad face...

569
00:54:27,958 --> 00:54:31,000
讓我發現對你有憤怒的感覺。
makes me discover angry feelings for you.

570
00:54:32,708 --> 00:54:33,583
正確的。
Right.

571
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:37,083
我變成了我最討厭的人…
I have become the very thing I hate...

572
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:39,625
貪得無厭的情人魅魔。
a grasping succubus of a lover.

573
00:54:41,208 --> 00:54:43,542
我已經把很多人從我身上撬開，現在我就是了。
I've pried many of them off me
and now I'm it.

574
00:54:44,083 --> 00:54:44,917
他媽的！
Fuck!

575
00:55:52,417 --> 00:55:55,458
你和我一樣，都是當下自由的生物。
You, like me, are a creature of freedom
in the moments.

576
00:55:58,458 --> 00:55:59,708
你一直這樣做是為了什麼？
What do you keep doing that for?

577
00:56:00,792 --> 00:56:02,958
那邊有個男人不斷地對我眨眼。
A man over there repeated blinks at me.

578
00:56:03,875 --> 00:56:05,292
我眨了眨眼。
I blink back.

579
00:56:05,458 --> 00:56:06,833
我認為是出於禮貌。
For polites, I think.

580
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,708
我們要去城裡跳舞。請加入我們。
We are going to dance in town.
Please join us.

581
00:56:21,875 --> 00:56:23,958
我從來沒有在城裡跳舞過。
I have never danced in town.

582
00:56:36,625 --> 00:56:38,250
- 鄧肯！- 不能！
- Duncan!
- Can't!

583
00:56:52,417 --> 00:56:53,250
你真是太生氣了。
You're quite mad.

584
00:56:53,417 --> 00:56:56,333
別說話了，你的聲音會讓貝拉生氣！
Stop talking
as your sounds make Bella angry!

585
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:57,750
我不會停止說話。
I will not stop talking.

586
00:56:57,917 --> 00:56:58,917
如果我有話要說，我會...
If I have something to say I'll...

587
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:00,000
哎喲。
Ouch.

588
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:08,792
好的。
All right.

589
00:57:12,875 --> 00:57:13,625
這是什麼？
What's this?

590
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,292
一個人教我下棋...
A man was teaching me chess...

591
00:57:19,458 --> 00:57:24,083
他說他認為我的皮膚可能是他接觸過的最柔軟的。
and he said he thought I would probably have
the softest skin he had ever touched.

592
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:28,667
我說，如果我這樣做的話，那就是測試大腿內側…
And I said, if I did it would be
the inner thighs to test...

593
00:57:28,833 --> 00:57:32,000
因為那是表皮最細的地方。
as that is where the epidermis
is at its most fine.

594
00:57:32,167 --> 00:57:33,250
所以我們測試了...
So we tested...

595
00:57:33,417 --> 00:57:35,500
這是有史以​​來最柔軟的。
and it was the softest ever.

596
00:57:36,292 --> 00:57:39,583
我想知道他們在溫柔方面是否不平等。
I wondered if perhaps
they're not equal in softitude.

597
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:41,208
事實上他們不是。
Indeed they were not.

598
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:44,417
所以我一定要記下來，記得哪個是哪個。
So I made sure to note it,
remembering which was which.

599
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:54,000
你要表演什麼舌頭劇？
What of the tongue play
you were about to perform?

600
00:57:57,958 --> 00:57:59,542
這不是發生了嗎？
Is that not happening?

601
00:58:17,708 --> 00:58:18,750
你...
You...

602
00:58:21,292 --> 00:58:22,542
你很煩惱。
You are troubled.

603
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:25,292
他對你撒謊了嗎？
Did he lie with you?

604
00:58:26,125 --> 00:58:27,792
不，我們是靠牆了。
No, we were against a wall.

605
00:58:28,792 --> 00:58:30,417
你有沒有生氣地跳他？
Did you furious jump him?

606
00:58:30,583 --> 00:58:33,750
不，他只是快速舔了我的陰蒂。
No, he just fast-licked my clitoris.

607
00:58:33,917 --> 00:58:37,667
我有需要釋放的熱量，所以按照我的要求釋放了。
I had the heat that needed release,
so at my request it was.

608
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,167
你也可以用舌頭來玩我…
You, too, may tongue play me...

609
00:58:43,333 --> 00:58:48,167
所以我無法理解這種複雜的感覺。
so I'm not understanding
this complicated feeling.

610
00:58:51,417 --> 00:58:52,958
你現在在哭嗎？
Are you now crying?

611
00:59:01,458 --> 00:59:05,417
你真是個令人困惑的人，鄧肯·韋德伯恩。
What a confusing person you are,
Duncan Wedderburn.

612
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:06,875
一個肝臟。
A liver.

613
00:59:16,417 --> 00:59:19,125
一個小切口...
A small incision...

614
00:59:19,708 --> 00:59:22,875
這就是所需要的一切。
is all that is needed.

615
00:59:36,792 --> 00:59:38,750
整個早上我都是氯仿山羊。
I was chloroforming goats all morning.

616
00:59:38,917 --> 00:59:41,333
我可能攝取太多了。
I may have ingested too much.

617
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:46,375
我冒昧地告訴你，貝拉的缺席讓你感到不安。
I am going to venture to suggest
you are upset by Bella's absence.

618
00:59:46,542 --> 00:59:48,167
波特酒的升數...
The liters of port...

619
00:59:48,333 --> 00:59:49,917
我晚上聽到的抽泣聲。
the sobbing I hear at night.

620
00:59:50,083 --> 00:59:52,958
天哪，夥計！你像個白痴一樣胡言亂語。
Good God, man! You prattle like an imbecile.

621
00:59:53,125 --> 00:59:54,417
她走了！
She is gone!

622
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:57,667
我是一個科學人。
I am a man of science.

623
00:59:57,833 --> 01:00:00,917
我只需要參與並繼續這個專案。
I just need to engage in,
and continue, the project.

624
01:00:01,083 --> 01:00:04,083
就這些。我必須繼續下一件事。
That is all.
I must go on to the next thing.

625
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:06,625
我們的感情必須放在一邊。
Our feelings must be put aside.

626
01:00:07,458 --> 01:00:10,333
你認為我父親會給我烙印嗎？
Do you think my father
could have branded me...

627
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:13,208
像他那樣用熱熨斗燙生殖器…
with hot irons on the genitals
the way he did...

628
01:00:13,375 --> 01:00:16,458
如果他不能把科學和進步放在第一位呢？
if he could not put
science and progress first?

629
01:00:16,625 --> 01:00:17,375
給你打上烙印了嗎？
Branded you?

630
01:00:19,917 --> 01:00:22,083
讓我們找出一具屍體。
Let us find a body.

631
01:00:23,417 --> 01:00:24,667
一個什麼？
A what?

632
01:00:47,833 --> 01:00:49,000
你好。早安.
Hello. Good morning.

633
01:00:51,667 --> 01:00:53,125
早安，親愛的。
Good morning, darling.

634
01:00:57,542 --> 01:01:00,750
我不太支持你的冒險精神。
I haven't been very supportive
of your adventurous spirit.

635
01:01:00,917 --> 01:01:02,542
所以我要給你一個驚喜。
So I have a surprise for you.

636
01:01:11,083 --> 01:01:12,042
進來。
Get in.

637
01:01:26,458 --> 01:01:29,375
- 我們換了飯店？- 看看窗外，貝拉。
- We changed hotels?
- Look out the window, Bella.

638
01:01:41,083 --> 01:01:43,000
- 我們在船上？- 的確。
- We're on boat?
- Indeed.

639
01:01:44,208 --> 01:01:48,417
- 你的目標是把貝拉困在海上。- 我的目標是給你一個新的冒險。
- You aim to trap Bella at sea.
- I aim to give you a new adventure.

640
01:01:48,583 --> 01:01:51,125
我想這是真的，你會更容易找到。
I suppose it's true you'll be easier to find.

641
01:01:51,292 --> 01:01:53,833
來吧，脫掉我的衣服。
Come, disrobe me.

642
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:54,958
騎我吧
Ride me.

643
01:01:55,875 --> 01:01:58,333
然後我們將在前甲板上喝雞尾酒。
And we'll then have cocktails on foredeck.

644
01:02:17,292 --> 01:02:18,292
貝拉。
Bella.

645
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:23,333
貝拉。
Bella.

646
01:02:28,042 --> 01:02:28,875
貝拉。
Bella.

647
01:02:30,042 --> 01:02:30,917
貝拉！
Bella!

648
01:02:31,875 --> 01:02:34,375
藍色的。藍色的。藍色的。
Blue. Blue. Blue.

649
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:14,708
罵我？
Shit on me?

650
01:04:15,292 --> 01:04:16,083
笨蛋！
Fucker!

651
01:04:20,833 --> 01:04:21,750
女士。
Madam.

652
01:04:23,542 --> 01:04:25,042
我們什麼時候停下來？
When do we stop?

653
01:04:26,583 --> 01:04:28,417
雅典。三天。
Athens. Three days.

654
01:04:56,625 --> 01:04:58,917
那個女人火了，你看。
That woman's on fire, look.

655
01:05:01,958 --> 01:05:03,167
我知道你對我很生氣。
I know you're upset with me.

656
01:05:03,333 --> 01:05:06,125
原諒我綁架了你，但那是為了愛情。
Forgive my kidnapping of you,
but it was for love.

657
01:05:06,292 --> 01:05:08,542
浪漫的笑話。別這麼小氣。
A romantic jape.
Don't be such a cunt about it.

658
01:05:09,542 --> 01:05:12,000
- 我想喝一杯。- 當然，親愛的。
- I want a drink.
- Of course, my darling.

659
01:05:12,167 --> 01:05:15,375
這艘船很有趣，有一個值得探索的世界。
The ship is fun, a whole world to explore.

660
01:05:16,292 --> 01:05:18,083
你愛我嗎？我愛你。
Do you love me? I love you.

661
01:05:19,292 --> 01:05:23,375
明確描述我應該在自己身上尋找的元素。
Describe the elements I should be looking for
within myself to be sure.

662
01:05:24,583 --> 01:05:25,917
你只是感覺到或感覺不到。
You just feel it or not.

663
01:05:26,083 --> 01:05:29,667
因此，正如上帝所說，這不是證據基礎。
So it is no evidence base, as God would say.

664
01:05:30,417 --> 01:05:33,042
- 那麼如何憑經驗判斷呢？- 你他媽的在說什麼？
- So how judge it empirically?
- What the fuck are you talking about?

665
01:05:33,208 --> 01:05:34,167
你是誰？
Who are you?

666
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:36,958
你不知道香蕉是什麼，你從來沒有聽過西洋棋...
You don't know what bananas are,
you've never heard of chess...

667
01:05:37,125 --> 01:05:38,750
但你知道「經驗」是什麼意思。
and yet you know what "empirically" means.

668
01:05:38,917 --> 01:05:41,500
貝拉想要喝一杯。我現在說了兩次。
Bella wants a drink. I said twice now.

669
01:05:41,667 --> 01:05:44,125
我從未有過這樣的感覺。
I've never felt anything like this.

670
01:05:44,292 --> 01:05:45,708
這對你來說是真的嗎？
Is this true for you?

671
01:05:47,792 --> 01:05:49,458
我想，從經驗上來說確實如此。
I suppose, empirically it is.

672
01:05:53,083 --> 01:05:54,958
我的墨水沒了。
I'm out of ink.

673
01:05:59,875 --> 01:06:01,375
那你就擁有墨水了，我的愛人。
Then ink you shall have, my love.

674
01:06:14,542 --> 01:06:17,083
你好，有趣的老太太。
Hello, interesting older lady.

675
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:18,875
我必須摸摸你的頭髮。
I must touch your hair.

676
01:06:21,292 --> 01:06:23,000
我還注意到你的頭髮。
I also noticed your hair.

677
01:06:23,167 --> 01:06:27,167
就像半透明發光雞蛋上的絲綢一樣。
Just like silk on a translucent, glowing egg.

678
01:06:27,667 --> 01:06:30,208
這是一些奇特的詞，不知何故讓我興奮。
That is fancy words that excite me somehow.

679
01:06:30,375 --> 01:06:33,208
我看到你和帥哥在一起了
I saw you're with handsome over there.

680
01:06:33,375 --> 01:06:35,500
潔白的牙齒和堅硬的雞雞。
White teeth and a hard cock.

681
01:06:36,708 --> 01:06:38,042
鄧肯·韋德伯恩。
Duncan Wedderburn.

682
01:06:38,208 --> 01:06:41,542
他的牙齒也很硬。他的陰莖也是白色的。
His teeth are also hard.
His penis is also white.

683
01:06:41,708 --> 01:06:43,667
- 好的，我希望。- 他是我唯一的。
- Good lay, I hope.
- He is my only.

684
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:48,167
但我發現他在我的整個身體中引起了特殊的感覺...
But I find him to elicit exceptional
sensations throughout my whole body...

685
01:06:48,333 --> 01:06:50,500
這讓我高興地大喊。
that leave me yelping happily.

686
01:06:50,667 --> 01:06:54,583
我也想把他的身體、形體、屍體，丟進海裡。
I also wish to dash his body, form, cadaver,
into the sea.

687
01:06:55,208 --> 01:06:56,542
這個男人跳到你身上了嗎？
Is this man jumping on your body?

688
01:06:57,125 --> 01:06:58,458
他不是。
No, he is not.

689
01:06:58,625 --> 01:07:00,625
我已經20年沒有上床睡覺了。
I haven't been bedded in 20 years.

690
01:07:00,792 --> 01:07:01,750
什麼？
What?

691
01:07:02,417 --> 01:07:03,583
太糟糕了。
That is terrible.

692
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:05,583
這對我來說並不重要。
It doesn't concern me greatly.

693
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:07,750
隨著歲月的流逝...
As years have passed...

694
01:07:07,917 --> 01:07:10,542
我最關心的是我耳朵之間的東西。
what's in between my ears
is my big concern.

695
01:07:11,125 --> 01:07:13,083
我的兩腿之間有什麼...
What's in between my legs...

696
01:07:14,583 --> 01:07:15,667
更不如此。
much less so.

697
01:07:15,833 --> 01:07:18,083
絕望的合理化，瑪莎。
A desperate rationalization, Martha.

698
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:20,458
哦，這是哈利·阿斯特利。
Oh, this is Harry Astley.

699
01:07:20,625 --> 01:07:23,667
別太把他的話放在心上。
Don't take what he says too much to heart.

700
01:07:24,125 --> 01:07:25,250
他是個憤世嫉俗的人。
He's a cynic.

701
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:26,917
女士。
Madam.

702
01:07:27,417 --> 01:07:29,000
我是貝拉·巴克斯特。
I am Bella Baxter.

703
01:07:29,958 --> 01:07:32,292
我不知道這個「憤世嫉俗」是什麼。
I do not know what this "cynic" is.

704
01:07:32,458 --> 01:07:33,250
貝拉。
Bella.

705
01:07:34,042 --> 01:07:34,875
墨水。
Ink.

706
01:07:35,042 --> 01:07:39,167
鄧肯‧韋德伯恩（Duncan Wedderburn），我結交了朋友、同事、同志。
Duncan Wedderburn,
I have made friends, colleagues, comrades.

707
01:07:39,333 --> 01:07:40,792
哈里·阿斯特利。
Harry Astley.

708
01:07:40,958 --> 01:07:42,458
這是瑪莎。
This is Martha.

709
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:45,750
她是我的新朋友，已經20年沒有被幹過了。
She is my new friend who has not been fucked
in 20 years.

710
01:07:45,917 --> 01:07:47,500
這不是驚訝嗎？
Is that not astonishment?

711
01:07:47,667 --> 01:07:51,125
我希望你把手放在兩腿之間，讓自己保持快樂。
I hope you use your hand between your legs
to keep yourself happy.

712
01:07:51,292 --> 01:07:54,750
天哪，貝拉，你不能這樣說話。
Good God, Bella,
you cannot speak like this.

713
01:07:54,917 --> 01:07:57,000
社會的有禮貌的人。我忘了。
Polites of society. I forgot.

714
01:07:57,167 --> 01:07:58,625
文明社會...
Polite society...

715
01:07:58,792 --> 01:08:00,208
會毀了你。
will destroy you.

716
01:08:00,375 --> 01:08:02,500
- 它會？- 是的，這有一定道理。
- It will?
- Yeah, there's some truth to that.

717
01:08:02,667 --> 01:08:04,458
我們都同意這一點。
We all agreed on that.

718
01:08:04,625 --> 01:08:06,958
至於你向我提出的詢問。
As to your enquiry on my hand.

719
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:08,958
偶爾，是的。
Occasionally, yes.

720
01:08:09,125 --> 01:08:11,375
這是一個非常令人放心的消息。
That is much reassuring news.

721
01:08:12,208 --> 01:08:14,708
- 我們大家一起吃飯。- 實際上...
- We shall all dine together.
- Well, actually...

722
01:08:15,208 --> 01:08:17,417
我們都在船上，無法逃脫…
We are all on a ship and cannot escape...

723
01:08:17,582 --> 01:08:20,667
這裡有一個值得享受、穿越、環遊的世界。
and there is a world to enjoy,
traverse, circumnavigate.

724
01:08:21,582 --> 01:08:23,707
或者她就不能有朋友嗎，韋德伯恩先生？
Or can she not have friends, Mr. Wedderburn?

725
01:08:24,832 --> 01:08:25,957
高興極了。
Delighted.

726
01:08:29,082 --> 01:08:30,375
嫁給我吧。
Marry me.

727
01:08:30,542 --> 01:08:31,375
什麼？
What?

728
01:08:31,542 --> 01:08:32,875
我本來想把你丟到一邊的。
I meant to throw you aside.

729
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:35,582
幾個月後，我會送你打包行李，但我不能。
A few months and send you packing,
but I cannot.

730
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:38,417
說你要嫁給我。從來沒有人擄獲我的心。你有。
Say you'll marry me.
No one's ever captured my heart. You have.

731
01:08:39,832 --> 01:08:41,082
這很棘手...
It is tricky...

732
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:43,667
因為我與馬克斯·麥坎德爾斯先生訂婚了。
as I am engaged to Mr. Max McCandles.

733
01:08:44,957 --> 01:08:45,792
什麼？
What?

734
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:49,000
我的手被另一隻手握住了。
My hand has taken by another.

735
01:08:49,707 --> 01:08:52,625
這是我聽過的一句話，但不明白。
It is a saying I heard,
but did not understand.

736
01:08:52,792 --> 01:08:55,957
你不只是握住手，而是握住全部，不是嗎？
You do not take just the hand,
but all, do you not?

737
01:08:56,125 --> 01:08:58,707
你帶著我逃離了他。
You ran away with me from him.

738
01:08:58,875 --> 01:09:02,125
對事件的重述，其意義對我來說難以捉摸。
A recounting of events,
the point of which is elusive to me.

739
01:09:02,292 --> 01:09:03,582
你選擇了我而不是他。
You chose me over him.

740
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:05,250
目前。
For now.

741
01:09:05,417 --> 01:09:06,457
為了娛樂。
For fun.

742
01:09:06,625 --> 01:09:09,292
我他媽的會把你丟到海裡去！
I'll fucking throw you overboard!

743
01:09:09,457 --> 01:09:12,417
所以你想娶我還是殺我？
So you wish to marry me or kill me?

744
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:15,250
- 這是提案嗎？- 不。
- Is that the proposal?
- No.

745
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:32,707
去賭場。
Going to the casino.

746
01:09:44,082 --> 01:09:45,167
沒關係。
That's fine.

747
01:09:45,917 --> 01:09:47,125
她也跟著來了。
She is coming along.

748
01:09:47,292 --> 01:09:48,875
讓我們再試一次。
Let's try again.

749
01:09:49,375 --> 01:09:52,917
粗大動作技能會慢慢發展...
Gross motor skills will develop slowly...

750
01:09:53,375 --> 01:09:55,792
但你會進步很快。
but you will progress fast.

751
01:09:57,792 --> 01:09:58,833
費莉西蒂。
Felicity.

752
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
沒那麼快。
Not that fast.

753
01:10:15,833 --> 01:10:17,708
我正在讀愛默生。
I am reading Emerson.

754
01:10:17,875 --> 01:10:20,292
他談到了人類的進步。
He speaks about the improvement of men.

755
01:10:20,458 --> 01:10:23,542
我不知道他為什麼不給女性建議。
I do not know why
he does not give advice to women.

756
01:10:23,708 --> 01:10:25,292
也許他什麼都不知道。
Perhaps he does not know any.

757
01:10:26,333 --> 01:10:29,042
嘗試閱讀歌德。
Try and read Goethe.

758
01:10:29,208 --> 01:10:31,750
哲學是浪費時間，貝拉。
Philosophy is a waste of time, Bella.

759
01:10:31,917 --> 01:10:34,125
真的嗎？說多一點。
Really? Say more.

760
01:10:34,292 --> 01:10:36,208
不，不，哈利，你這個壞蛋。
No, no, Harry, you wretch.

761
01:10:36,375 --> 01:10:37,333
它是不可或缺的。
It is integral.

762
01:10:38,375 --> 01:10:41,458
人和社會都可以得到改善。
People and society can be improved.

763
01:10:42,458 --> 01:10:46,292
改進、進步、進步、成長是所有人的目標。
It is the goal of all to improve,
advance, progress, grow.

764
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:49,833
我知道我身上有這一點，我確信我代表了一切。
I know this in me,
and I am sure I am indicative of all.

765
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,042
相信我，貝拉，你在各方面都絕對是獨一無二的。
Trust me, you are definitely unique, Bella,
in all ways.

766
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:57,750
但這種透過哲學的改進......
But this improvement through philosophy...

767
01:10:57,917 --> 01:11:02,000
人們試圖逃避我們都是殘忍的野獸這一事實。
is people trying to run away from the fact
that we are all cruel beasts.

768
01:11:02,167 --> 01:11:04,458
那樣出生，那樣死去。
Born that way, die that way.

769
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:07,292
這是一種陰暗的看法，哈利。
It is a dark view of things, Harry.

770
01:11:07,458 --> 01:11:08,375
貝拉…
Bella...

771
01:11:09,917 --> 01:11:11,375
讓我們呼吸空氣...
let us take the air...

772
01:11:12,917 --> 01:11:14,542
在我們的小屋裡。
in our cabin.

773
01:11:15,167 --> 01:11:16,250
但這兩人卻在打架…
But these two are fighting...

774
01:11:16,417 --> 01:11:19,208
各種想法在貝拉的腦海和心中盤旋…
and ideas are banging around
in Bella's head and heart...

775
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:21,000
就像暴風雨中的燈光。
like lights in a storm.

776
01:11:23,667 --> 01:11:26,083
你現在總是在讀書，貝拉。
You're always reading now, Bella.

777
01:11:26,625 --> 01:11:30,167
你正在失去一些可愛的說話方式。
You're losing some of your adorable way
of speaking.

778
01:11:30,333 --> 01:11:32,000
我是一場變幻的盛宴…
I am a changingable feast...

779
01:11:32,167 --> 01:11:33,417
我們所有人也是如此。
as are all of we.

780
01:11:33,583 --> 01:11:36,417
顯然，根據愛默生的說法，哈利不同意。
Apparently according to Emerson,
disagreed with by Harry.

781
01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:37,875
來來。來吧。
Come, come. Just come.

782
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:41,167
你在我的陽光下。
You are in my sun.

783
01:11:41,333 --> 01:11:42,792
什麼？
What?

784
01:12:21,542 --> 01:12:22,500
來。
Come.

785
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:26,042
忙著喝酒。
Busy drinking heavily.

786
01:12:29,875 --> 01:12:31,875
忙著損失慘重。
Busy losing heavily.

787
01:13:11,125 --> 01:13:12,708
我必須去見瑪莎。
I must go meet Martha.

788
01:13:14,458 --> 01:13:15,708
瑪莎。
Martha.

789
01:13:16,667 --> 01:13:18,208
她就是問題所在。
She is the problem.

790
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:22,458
我會把那袋散發著香味的肉丟到海裡。
I'll throw that
perfumed bag of flesh overboard.

791
01:13:23,542 --> 01:13:24,667
我賭你。
I dare you.

792
01:13:35,083 --> 01:13:36,542
瑪莎！
Martha!

793
01:13:37,667 --> 01:13:39,000
她在哪？
Where is she?

794
01:13:39,167 --> 01:13:40,750
你在哪兒，他媽的。
Where are you, fuck.

795
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:42,292
她在哪？
Where is she?

796
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:46,125
- 你要去哪裡？- 她要翻到一邊了。
- Where are you going?
- She's going over the side.

797
01:13:46,292 --> 01:13:47,417
哦，太棒了！
Oh, marvelous!

798
01:13:47,583 --> 01:13:49,667
我從沒想過自己會被謀殺。
I never imagined being murdered.

799
01:13:49,833 --> 01:13:50,833
多麼戲劇化。
How dramatic.

800
01:13:51,417 --> 01:13:54,250
嗯，看來她死的很開心。很抱歉妨礙你了。
Well, she seems happy to die.
I'm sorry for getting in your way.

801
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:01,458
令人興奮。
Exciting.

802
01:14:19,333 --> 01:14:20,792
我會在酒吧。
I'll be in the bar.

803
01:14:54,583 --> 01:14:57,208
你讓我思考、思考…
You have made me think, cogitate...

804
01:14:58,083 --> 01:15:00,917
反覆思考錯誤的想法...
perambulate on ideas that are wrong...

805
01:15:01,083 --> 01:15:04,250
錯誤且無意義的煩人...
erroneous and nonsensically annoying...

806
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:06,125
這導致我無法入睡。
that lead me not to sleep.

807
01:15:06,292 --> 01:15:07,417
所以...
So...

808
01:15:09,292 --> 01:15:11,417
你說一切都是殘酷的。
You say all are cruel.

809
01:15:11,583 --> 01:15:14,167
我不同意，否認...
And I disagree, disavow...

810
01:15:14,333 --> 01:15:15,375
並說不。
and say no not.

811
01:15:16,625 --> 01:15:18,625
但當和鄧肯在一起時...
But when with Duncan...

812
01:15:18,792 --> 01:15:21,333
殘酷的事在我心裡冒泡。
the cruel just bubbles up in me.

813
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:23,250
這表明了良好的判斷力。
That shows good judgment.

814
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:25,750
他是個漂亮的白痴。
He is a pretty moron.

815
01:15:25,917 --> 01:15:26,875
不。
No.

816
01:15:27,542 --> 01:15:29,167
我不想變得殘忍。
I do not wish to be cruel.

817
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:33,000
我必須提升自己的這一方面。
I must improve this aspect of myself.

818
01:15:33,167 --> 01:15:34,708
你不了解這個世界。
You don't know the world.

819
01:15:35,292 --> 01:15:36,375
你害怕它。
And you fear it.

820
01:15:38,792 --> 01:15:40,375
我不害怕它。
I do not fear it.

821
01:15:40,792 --> 01:15:42,958
你想看看世界到底是什麼樣子嗎？
Do you want to see what the world
is really like?

822
01:15:43,583 --> 01:15:44,417
我會給你看。
I'll show you.

823
01:15:45,167 --> 01:15:46,083
是的。
Yes.

824
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:47,792
當然。
Of course.

825
01:16:34,667 --> 01:16:35,667
你聽到了嗎？
Do you hear that?

826
01:16:39,292 --> 01:16:40,292
它是什麼？
What is it?

827
01:17:01,708 --> 01:17:03,208
很多死去的嬰兒。
Lot of dead babies.

828
01:17:04,208 --> 01:17:05,417
一定很熱。
Must be hot.

829
01:17:07,167 --> 01:17:08,583
我們必須去幫助他們。
We must go help them.

830
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:11,000
我們將如何做到這一點？
How will we do that?

831
01:17:13,875 --> 01:17:15,167
我們去那裡...
We go down there...

832
01:17:15,333 --> 01:17:18,833
他們會理所當然地繩索我們、搶劫我們、強暴我們。
they'll quite rightfully rope us,
rob us, and rape us.

833
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,167
如果他們在這裡而我們在那裡......
And if they were here
and we were there...

834
01:17:21,792 --> 01:17:23,167
我們也會對他們做同樣的事情。
we'd do the same to them.

835
01:17:27,708 --> 01:17:28,500
貝拉。
Bella.

836
01:17:29,583 --> 01:17:30,542
貝拉。
Bella.

837
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:32,500
貝拉。
Bella.

838
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,292
我們要離開了，女士。
We are casting off, ma'am.

839
01:19:16,792 --> 01:19:18,292
但我必須回去。
But I have to go back.

840
01:19:19,375 --> 01:19:23,167
我必須把這筆錢送給飯店附近的窮人...
I must give this money
to the poor near the hotel...

841
01:19:23,333 --> 01:19:24,875
在他們所謂的貧民窟裡。
in what they call a slum.

842
01:19:26,125 --> 01:19:27,542
我們留在岸上，女士。
We're staying ashore, ma'am.

843
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:29,958
我們可以為您解決這個問題。
We could take care of that for you.

844
01:19:30,667 --> 01:19:31,500
你可以？
You can?

845
01:19:31,708 --> 01:19:32,708
當然。
Of course.

846
01:19:33,083 --> 01:19:34,667
你真慷慨。
It is generous of you.

847
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:36,333
他們需要錢。
They need money.

848
01:19:36,833 --> 01:19:38,042
每個人都這樣做。
Everyone does.

849
01:19:43,708 --> 01:19:44,750
謝謝。
Thank you.

850
01:20:01,917 --> 01:20:05,333
你！給我找隊長吧 現在我們要找到這個該死的小偷。
You! Get me the captain.
Now we'll find this fucking thief.

851
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:06,333
貝拉！
Bella!

852
01:20:08,167 --> 01:20:09,208
我們被搶劫了！
We've been robbed!

853
01:20:10,083 --> 01:20:11,333
我贏了。
I won.

854
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:12,958
我贏得了一切...
I won everything...

855
01:20:13,125 --> 01:20:14,583
前所未有。
like never before.

856
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:16,917
現在它消失了。
And now it's gone.

857
01:20:17,083 --> 01:20:18,792
你沒有被搶劫。
You've not been robbed.

858
01:20:18,958 --> 01:20:20,792
- 我拿了。- 為了什麼？
- I took it.
- For what?

859
01:20:21,375 --> 01:20:22,417
我拿了。
I took it.

860
01:20:24,333 --> 01:20:25,625
我好累。
I'm so tired.

861
01:20:27,625 --> 01:20:29,958
或者也許只是我的精神。
Or maybe just my spirit is.

862
01:20:30,833 --> 01:20:33,458
我的靈魂已經被扭曲、扭曲了…
My soul has been buckled, crumpled...

863
01:20:33,667 --> 01:20:36,458
扁平化，鄧肯‧韋德伯恩…
flattened, Duncan Wedderburn...

864
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:38,833
就我所見過的景點而言。
by the sights I have seen.

865
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,458
- 那麼，那就不需要船長了，長官？- 在我打碎你所有的牙齒之前滾開。
- So, no need for the captain then, sir?
- Fuck off before I break all your teeth.

866
01:20:46,917 --> 01:20:48,083
確實如此，先生。
Indeed, sir.

867
01:20:51,750 --> 01:20:52,792
它在哪裡？
Where is it?

868
01:20:53,542 --> 01:20:55,083
為了安全你把它藏起來了。
You hid it for safety.

869
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:58,625
我喝醉了，愚蠢地把它丟得到處都是。終於解脫了。
I was drunk and foolishly left it everywhere.
What a relief.

870
01:20:59,292 --> 01:21:01,042
我沒有隱藏它。
I did not hide it.

871
01:21:01,833 --> 01:21:05,208
我把它給了那裡的那些窮人。
I gave it to those poor people out there.

872
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:08,917
金錢本身就是一種疾病…
Money is its own form of sickness...

873
01:21:09,458 --> 01:21:11,125
以及它的所有稀缺性。
and all the scarcity of it.

874
01:21:12,542 --> 01:21:14,042
而我是誰...
And who am I...

875
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:16,708
躺在羽毛床上…
lying in a feather bed...

876
01:21:17,917 --> 01:21:19,458
當死去的嬰兒...
while dead babies...

877
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:21,417
躺在溝裡？
lie in a ditch?

878
01:21:23,375 --> 01:21:24,417
鄧肯.
Duncan.

879
01:21:26,167 --> 01:21:28,000
你什麼？
You what?

880
01:21:29,625 --> 01:21:32,667
我期待著一個安慰的擁抱。
I am expecting a hug of solace.

881
01:21:33,542 --> 01:21:34,375
你...
You...

882
01:21:34,583 --> 01:21:37,167
我需要向世界提供一些東西。
I need to offer something
to the world.

883
01:21:38,125 --> 01:21:39,625
而我卻一無所有。
And yet I have nothing.

884
01:21:40,917 --> 01:21:42,125
除了一些錢。
Except some money.

885
01:21:44,083 --> 01:21:46,875
對貝拉·巴克斯特來說，這是糟糕的一天。
It is a bad day for Bella Baxter.

886
01:21:47,958 --> 01:21:51,250
我他媽的錢在哪裡？
Where is my fucking money?

887
01:21:51,417 --> 01:21:52,542
我剛剛告訴過你了。
I just told you.

888
01:21:52,750 --> 01:21:55,458
我把它送給了窮人。
I gave it away to the poor.

889
01:21:56,917 --> 01:21:59,167
我以為我叫你滾開！
I thought I told you to fuck off!

890
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:01,750
管家通知我...
The steward informs me...

891
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:04,792
先生，您可能沒有足夠的資金來償還您的帳戶。
that you may not have sufficient funds
to make good your account, sir.

892
01:22:05,458 --> 01:22:07,208
- 嗯，我... - 這可能是真的。
- Well, I...
- That is probably true.

893
01:22:08,083 --> 01:22:10,042
我把一切都給了一些好人...
I gave it all to some nice men...

894
01:22:11,083 --> 01:22:12,417
傳遞...
to pass on...

895
01:22:12,917 --> 01:22:14,375
給貧民窟的窮人。
to the slum poor.

896
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,167
你將在下一個港口被送上岸...
You'll be put ashore at the next port...

897
01:22:17,333 --> 01:22:19,458
在此之前僅限於船員的口糧，長官。
and confined to crew's rations
until then, sir.

898
01:22:19,625 --> 01:22:21,500
- 晚安. - 你怎麼敢？
- Good evening.
- How dare you?

899
01:22:32,667 --> 01:22:36,125
「死了，瞎眼的嬰兒......
"Dead, blind babies...

900
01:22:37,583 --> 01:22:38,917
」哈利咬了一口。
"bit Harry.

901
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:42,417
「我的嘴巴...
"My mouth...

902
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:46,000
“渾身是血。”
"was full of blood."

903
01:22:47,333 --> 01:22:48,458
可憐的貝拉。
Poor Bella.

904
01:22:50,292 --> 01:22:51,500
她是一片廢墟。
She is a ruin.

905
01:22:56,750 --> 01:22:58,500
- 你的手怎麼樣？- 沒關係。
- How's your hand?
- It's fine.

906
01:22:59,042 --> 01:23:00,083
對不起。
I'm sorry.

907
01:23:00,250 --> 01:23:01,958
你試著幫助我理解。
You were trying to help me understand.

908
01:23:02,125 --> 01:23:04,667
不，我其實是想傷害你。
No. I actually wanted to hurt you.

909
01:23:05,875 --> 01:23:09,917
無法忍受看到某人如此愚蠢而美麗的幸福。
Couldn't bear to see such dumb,
beautiful happiness in someone.

910
01:23:10,417 --> 01:23:11,667
這對我來說太殘酷了。
It was cruel of me.

911
01:23:12,333 --> 01:23:13,500
我不後悔。
I am not sorry.

912
01:23:14,375 --> 01:23:16,208
如果我了解這個世界，我就能改善它。
If I know the world, I can improve it.

913
01:23:16,375 --> 01:23:17,500
你不能。
You can't.

914
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,417
這才是真正的重點。
That is the real point.

915
01:23:20,042 --> 01:23:21,750
不要接受宗教的謊言...
Don't accept the lie of religion...

916
01:23:21,917 --> 01:23:22,750
社會主義...
socialism...

917
01:23:23,292 --> 01:23:24,375
資本主義。
capitalism.

918
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:26,417
我們是個該死的物種。
We are a fucked species.

919
01:23:26,667 --> 01:23:28,875
知道。希望是可以粉碎的。
Know it. Hope is smashable.

920
01:23:29,042 --> 01:23:30,250
現實主義則不然。
Realism is not.

921
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:32,458
用真相保護自己。
Protect yourself with the truth.

922
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:36,375
我現在知道你是什麼了，哈利。
I realize what you are now, Harry.

923
01:23:36,542 --> 01:23:39,625
只是一個無法承受世間痛苦的破碎小男孩。
Just a broken little boy
who cannot bear the pain of the world.

924
01:23:41,542 --> 01:23:42,667
我想是這樣。
I suppose so.

925
01:23:51,875 --> 01:23:53,042
再見，哈利。
Goodbye, Harry.

926
01:23:53,250 --> 01:23:54,917
我們在馬賽被甩掉了。
We get thrown off in Marseille.

927
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:57,250
為什麼留在他身邊？
Why do you stay with him?

928
01:23:57,833 --> 01:23:59,333
我總覺得這樣會更好。
I always think it will be better.

929
01:24:01,250 --> 01:24:02,375
你當然知道。
'Course you do.

930
01:24:18,833 --> 01:24:21,500
我聽過巴黎的美麗。
I have heard great things
of the beauty of Paris.

931
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:27,417
我他媽的會把你的狗踢死。
I'll fucking kick your dog to death.

932
01:24:30,833 --> 01:24:31,833
他媽的...
Fucking...

933
01:24:32,375 --> 01:24:34,000
巴黎沒錢。
Paris with no money.

934
01:24:34,458 --> 01:24:37,375
- 你建議我們做什麼，貝拉？- 我會幫我們找一家旅館。
- What do you suggest we do, Bella?
- I will get us a hotel.

935
01:24:37,542 --> 01:24:38,583
不用擔心。
Do not worry.

936
01:24:39,208 --> 01:24:40,792
什麼？我們沒有錢。
With what? We have no money.

937
01:24:42,667 --> 01:24:45,250
這不是一個有趣的實驗嗎？
Is it not an interesting experiment?

938
01:24:45,417 --> 01:24:46,333
我們什麼都沒有。
We have nothing.

939
01:24:46,958 --> 01:24:48,833
- 我們現在要怎麼生活？- 我不知道！
- How will we live now?
- I don't know!

940
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,917
沒錯，就是這個實驗。
Exactly, that is the experiment.

941
01:24:51,333 --> 01:24:52,542
我們現在是窮人。
We are now the poor.

942
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:56,125
而且，許多冒險家都面臨過這些困難。
Also, many adventurers have faced these odds.

943
01:24:56,708 --> 01:24:58,083
例如，魯賓遜漂流記。
Robinson Crusoe, for example.

944
01:24:58,625 --> 01:25:01,208
自私、粗心、粗心的婊子。
Selfish, thoughtless, careless bitch.

945
01:25:01,458 --> 01:25:03,625
我並不是粗心大意，鄧肯。
I'm not thoughtless, Duncan.

946
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:05,667
雖然我的能力確實如此...
And while it is true my ability...

947
01:25:05,833 --> 01:25:08,917
透過思考事情得出合乎邏輯的結論並不是...
to think things through
to the logical conclusions is not...

948
01:25:09,542 --> 01:25:10,708
強的...
strong...

949
01:25:11,125 --> 01:25:13,167
我確實幫助了那些受苦受難的人。
I did help those suffering people.

950
01:25:13,583 --> 01:25:14,583
我毀了我們...
I have ruined us...

951
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,250
正如你指出的...
as you pointed out...

952
01:25:16,792 --> 01:25:19,083
但我確實相信我的行為來自一個好的地方。
but I do believe my actions
come from a good place.

953
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:21,333
他媽的閉嘴。
Shut the fuck up.

954
01:25:22,208 --> 01:25:23,583
我會幫我們找一家旅館。
I will get us a hotel.

955
01:25:28,917 --> 01:25:30,333
下午好，女士。
Good afternoon, madam.

956
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:33,667
美好的一天，我新鮮的、親愛的英國玫瑰。
Good day, my fresh, darling English Rose.

957
01:25:34,625 --> 01:25:35,667
這是飯店嗎？
Is this a hotel?

958
01:25:35,875 --> 01:25:36,958
我們有房間。
We have rooms.

959
01:25:37,458 --> 01:25:38,667
你在找工作嗎？
Are you looking for work?

960
01:25:38,833 --> 01:25:39,875
一間房多少錢？
How much is a room?

961
01:25:40,042 --> 01:25:42,125
我將向你收取每小時 10 法郎的費用。
I'll charge you 10 francs an hour.

962
01:25:42,292 --> 01:25:44,333
你收他們30。
You charge them 30.

963
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:45,625
每個人都很高興。
Everyone's happy.

964
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:47,250
我懂了。
I see.

965
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:49,167
查佩爾先生。
Monsieur Chapelle.

966
01:25:49,333 --> 01:25:50,333
剛從倫敦回來。
Fresh from London.

967
01:25:52,333 --> 01:25:53,333
你好。
Hello.

968
01:25:59,083 --> 01:26:00,292
那麼，你走吧。
So, off you go.

969
01:26:00,750 --> 01:26:02,292
此時我很困惑。
At this point, I am confused.

970
01:26:02,458 --> 01:26:04,083
你不是來這裡工作的嗎？
You're not here to work?

971
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:05,458
快點。
Come on.

972
01:26:05,625 --> 01:26:08,083
跟他躺在一起，讓他給你一點雞雞...
Lie with him, let him cock you a bit...

973
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:09,625
賺一些不錯的法郎。
and make some nice francs.

974
01:26:09,792 --> 01:26:10,625
我懂了。
I see.

975
01:26:11,625 --> 01:26:12,917
他會為此付錢給我嗎？
He would pay me for this?

976
01:26:13,417 --> 01:26:14,417
是的。
Yes.

977
01:26:14,958 --> 01:26:16,417
如果你需要錢...
If you need money...

978
01:26:16,583 --> 01:26:18,667
這是到達它的最短路線。
it is the shortest route to it.

979
01:26:19,667 --> 01:26:22,542
我從來沒有被別的男人欺負過...
I have never been cocked by another man...

980
01:26:23,208 --> 01:26:24,667
但對此感到好奇。
and yet have wondered on that.

981
01:26:25,583 --> 01:26:27,000
並且我需要資金。
And am in need of funds.

982
01:26:28,417 --> 01:26:31,875
我相信，這是多種情況的結合...
It is, I believe,
a confluence of circumstances...

983
01:26:32,042 --> 01:26:34,042
我認為幾乎是命運般的。
I regard as almost fate-like.

984
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:35,833
讓我們這樣做吧。
Let us do this.

985
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:39,750
16號房間。
Room 16.

986
01:27:17,458 --> 01:27:18,583
你叫什麼名字？
What is your name?

987
01:27:26,625 --> 01:27:27,792
神秘。
Mysterious.

988
01:27:55,542 --> 01:27:57,167
我們是不是應該讓我暖和一點...
Should we warm me up a bit...

989
01:28:30,250 --> 01:28:31,083
美好的一天，先生。
Good day, sir.

990
01:28:31,542 --> 01:28:33,000
巧克力泡芙？
Éclair au chocolat?

991
01:28:34,375 --> 01:28:36,917
我得到了一些錢，也得到了一些啟示。
I've come into some money
and some enlightenment.

992
01:28:37,792 --> 01:28:38,833
你偷的？
You stole it?

993
01:28:39,250 --> 01:28:42,042
你總是說你是世界上最好的寢具...
You've always said you're
the best bedman in the world...

994
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:46,042
我從未認識過其他人，所以我不知道這是否屬實。
and I have never known another,
so I knew not whether this was true.

995
01:28:46,583 --> 01:28:47,792
但現在我知道了。
But now I do.

996
01:28:48,417 --> 01:28:49,667
而且他很可怕...
And he was terrible...

997
01:28:50,125 --> 01:28:53,250
當他插入我體內時，他發出了不敬虔的聲音。
and made ungodly noises
as he thrust himself into me.

998
01:28:53,417 --> 01:28:56,958
鄧肯·韋德伯恩（Duncan Wedderburn）僅僅三下，他就只能做到了。
And a mere three thrusts, Duncan Wedderburn,
was all he could manage.

999
01:28:57,167 --> 01:28:58,583
我忍住笑了…
I stifled a laugh...

1000
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:00,583
當然，出於禮貌。
out of polites, of course.

1001
01:29:00,750 --> 01:29:02,792
我拿了他的錢。我向他道謝。
I took his money. I thanked him.

1002
01:29:02,958 --> 01:29:05,375
為了買給我們這些閃電泡芙，我一路笑著…
I laughed all the way
to buy us these eclairs...

1003
01:29:05,542 --> 01:29:06,667
我如此深情地想...
and I thought so fondly...

1004
01:29:07,542 --> 01:29:10,167
還記得我們那些汗流浹背的夜晚。
remembering the fierce sweaty nights of ours.

1005
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:13,375
你他媽是為了錢嗎？
You fucked for money?

1006
01:29:13,542 --> 01:29:15,083
並作為一個實驗。
And as an experiment.

1007
01:29:15,917 --> 01:29:20,000
這對我們的關係有好處，因為它讓我對你的心感到高興。
And it is good for our relationship
as it gladdens my heart toward you.

1008
01:29:20,167 --> 01:29:23,875
最近我對你這個愛哭、愛罵髒話的人有點心灰意冷。
My heart has been a bit dim
on your weepy, sweary person lately.

1009
01:29:25,708 --> 01:29:28,250
你是個怪物。一個妓女和一個怪物。
You are a monster. A whore and a monster.

1010
01:29:28,417 --> 01:29:29,875
從地獄派來的惡魔…
A demon sent from hell...

1011
01:29:30,083 --> 01:29:31,625
將我的靈魂撕成碎片。
to rip my spirit to shreds.

1012
01:29:31,792 --> 01:29:34,542
為了懲罰我的小罪…
To punish my tiny sins...

1013
01:29:34,708 --> 01:29:36,375
伴隨著毀滅性的海嘯。
with a tsunami of destruction.

1014
01:29:36,542 --> 01:29:38,333
奪走我的心，像太妃糖一樣拉扯它…
To take my heart and pull it like taffy...

1015
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:39,333
毀了我。
to ruin me.

1016
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:41,417
我看著你，只看到醜陋。
I look at you,
and I see nothing but ugliness.

1017
01:29:42,917 --> 01:29:45,875
最後一點是沒有必要的，沒有意義...
That last bit was uncalled for
and makes no sense...

1018
01:29:46,042 --> 01:29:48,667
因為你對我的美麗的頌歌很無聊...
as your odes to my beauty have been boring...

1019
01:29:48,833 --> 01:29:49,875
但不變。
but constant.

1020
01:29:50,458 --> 01:29:52,708
還有這個簡單的動作...
And the simple act...

1021
01:29:52,875 --> 01:29:55,333
讓一個陌生男人騎在我身上...
of letting a strange man ride on me...

1022
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:56,542
已經抹掉了這一切？
has erased all that?

1023
01:29:58,875 --> 01:29:59,875
他媽的！
Fuck!

1024
01:30:00,042 --> 01:30:02,125
你自己嫖娼了。
You whored yourself.

1025
01:30:02,625 --> 01:30:04,875
你現在要向我解釋的事情很糟糕。
Which you are now going to
explain to me is bad.

1026
01:30:05,250 --> 01:30:06,458
我和你永遠無法共贏嗎？
Can I never win with you?

1027
01:30:06,625 --> 01:30:09,333
這是女人能做的最糟糕的事。
It is the worst thing women can do.

1028
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:12,542
我們絕對不該結婚。
We should definitely never marry.

1029
01:30:13,417 --> 01:30:15,667
我是一個有缺陷、喜歡嘗試的人...
I am a flawed, experimenting person...

1030
01:30:15,833 --> 01:30:18,625
我需要一個性情比較寬容的丈夫。
and I will need a husband
with a more forgiving disposition.

1031
01:30:19,250 --> 01:30:20,583
屄！
Cunt!

1032
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:22,333
我現在看出你不是那樣的人。
I can now see you are not that.

1033
01:30:23,167 --> 01:30:24,583
我們的冒險顯然已經結束了。
Our adventure is clearly over.

1034
01:30:25,208 --> 01:30:27,208
我會給你訂一張回倫敦的機票。
I shall book you a passage back to London.

1035
01:30:27,667 --> 01:30:29,083
你有錢...
You had money...

1036
01:30:29,792 --> 01:30:30,833
一直這樣？
this whole time?

1037
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,250
這是上帝的錢。
It is God's money.

1038
01:30:33,292 --> 01:30:34,333
用於緊急情況。
For emergencies.

1039
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:36,833
幾個星期以來，這一直是個該死的緊急情況！
It has been a fucking emergency
for weeks now!

1040
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,792
我一直相信你...
I believed in you the whole time...

1041
01:30:39,292 --> 01:30:40,917
你能應付自如。
that you would rise to the occasion.

1042
01:30:41,375 --> 01:30:44,667
但現在我發現那是個錯誤，而且你身上顯然有東西壞了。
But now I see that was a mistake,
and there's clearly something broken in you.

1043
01:30:44,833 --> 01:30:47,042
你破壞了我內心的某些東西！
You broke that something in me!

1044
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:49,417
我覺得這次談話已經變成循環了。
I feel this conversation has become circular.

1045
01:30:49,583 --> 01:30:52,000
屄！
Cunt!

1046
01:30:58,208 --> 01:31:00,542
斯威尼女士，我已經檢查了我的情況。
Madam Swiney, I have examined my situation.

1047
01:31:00,708 --> 01:31:02,292
我需要性和金錢。
I need sex and money.

1048
01:31:02,792 --> 01:31:04,000
我可以找個情人...
I could take a lover...

1049
01:31:04,167 --> 01:31:05,917
另一個會留住我的韋德伯恩......
another Wedderburn who would keep me...

1050
01:31:06,083 --> 01:31:08,167
但可能需要大量的關注。
but may require an awful lot of attention.

1051
01:31:08,333 --> 01:31:10,042
不然一次就20分鐘了...
Or else it's 20 minutes at a time...

1052
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:12,333
我剩下的時間可以自由地研究這個世界......
and the rest of my day
is free to study on the world...

1053
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:13,667
以及它的改進。
and the improvement of it.

1054
01:31:14,208 --> 01:31:16,542
於是我就想找工作...
Hence, I seek employment...

1055
01:31:16,708 --> 01:31:19,625
在你散發著霉味的歡樂淫亂場所。
at your musty-smelling establishment
of good-time fornication.

1056
01:31:19,792 --> 01:31:22,750
一個女人正在策劃她的自由之路。
A woman plotting her course to freedom.

1057
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:24,958
多麼令人愉快。
How delightful.

1058
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:26,750
來。
Come.

1059
01:31:30,292 --> 01:31:32,500
薩維爾先生。
Monsieur Saveur.

1060
01:31:34,250 --> 01:31:35,292
菲力牛排。
A filet mignon.

1061
01:31:35,875 --> 01:31:37,833
優質切割。
A prime cut.

1062
01:31:50,833 --> 01:31:52,125
貝拉。
Bella.

1063
01:31:53,917 --> 01:31:55,500
最後說「厲害」 。
Say "formidable" at the end.

1064
01:31:55,667 --> 01:31:56,625
家庭規則。
House rules.

1065
01:32:25,583 --> 01:32:27,125
那味道是你嗎？
Is that smell you?

1066
01:33:01,917 --> 01:33:03,042
強大。
Formidable.

1067
01:33:15,958 --> 01:33:17,125
為了氣味。
For the smell.

1068
01:33:18,083 --> 01:33:20,083
還有茶。只因為茶好喝。
And tea. Just because tea is nice.

1069
01:33:24,167 --> 01:33:25,375
太殘酷了…
It was brutal...

1070
01:33:25,875 --> 01:33:27,375
以一種奇怪但並不令人不快的方式。
in a strangely not unpleasant way.

1071
01:33:31,458 --> 01:33:32,500
小冊子。
Pamphlet.

1072
01:33:33,792 --> 01:33:34,958
- 讀。- 那是什麼？
- Read.
- What is that?

1073
01:33:35,125 --> 01:33:37,792
一個想要…… 讓世界變得更美好的人。
Une personne qui veut...
change the world pour le meilleur.

1074
01:33:37,958 --> 01:33:39,833
讓它變得更好。一個更好的世界。
Make it better. A better world.

1075
01:33:40,875 --> 01:33:42,625
那我也是這樣了。
Then I am that too.

1076
01:33:53,708 --> 01:33:54,583
史維妮女士…
Madam Swiney...

1077
01:33:54,958 --> 01:33:56,667
這個陣容系統...
this lineup system...

1078
01:33:56,833 --> 01:34:00,458
你真的希望我和一個男人一起上樓，即使我覺得他令人厭惡...
you really expect me to go upstairs
with a man even if I find him distasteful...

1079
01:34:00,625 --> 01:34:02,667
因此我感到悲傷...
and therefore am sad...

1080
01:34:02,833 --> 01:34:04,292
當我讓他憤怒地跳我的時候？
when I let him furious jump me?

1081
01:34:04,458 --> 01:34:06,875
事情就是這樣，親愛的。
That is the way it is, my darling.

1082
01:34:09,958 --> 01:34:11,417
天哪，你看起來很漂亮。
Gosh, you look pretty.

1083
01:34:11,583 --> 01:34:13,750
你多麼同意被蹂躪。
How it agrees with you to be ravaged.

1084
01:34:14,625 --> 01:34:15,667
我想是這樣。
I suppose so.

1085
01:34:20,542 --> 01:34:22,917
那麼，如果女人選擇…你會不會更喜歡呢？
So, would you not prefer it
if the women chose...

1086
01:34:23,333 --> 01:34:25,875
因為這會是對你熱情的表現？
as it would be a sign of enthusiasm
toward you?

1087
01:34:26,750 --> 01:34:29,333
你不會隱約感覺到他們正處於恐怖狀態…
You wouldn't have the vague sense
that they are in a state of horror...

1088
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:30,542
當你跳躍它們時。
when you jump them.

1089
01:34:34,792 --> 01:34:37,375
貝拉是新來的，可能有精神疾病。
Bella is new and may have a mental illness.

1090
01:34:41,458 --> 01:34:43,000
正如上帝、我的父親所說…
As God, my father, says...

1091
01:34:43,333 --> 01:34:46,042
這只是它的樣子，直到我們發現它的新方式...
it is only the way it is until we discover
the new way it is...

1092
01:34:46,208 --> 01:34:48,917
然後就是這樣，直到我們發現它的新方式...
and then that is the way it is
until we discover the new way it is...

1093
01:34:49,083 --> 01:34:51,167
如此下去，直到世界不再平坦......
and so it goes until the world
is no longer flat...

1094
01:34:51,333 --> 01:34:54,417
電照亮了夜晚，鞋子不再繫絲帶。
electricity lights the night,
and shoes are no longer tied with ribbons.

1095
01:34:55,625 --> 01:34:57,333
身為社會主義者，我完全同意。
As a socialist, I agree entirely.

1096
01:34:58,458 --> 01:35:00,958
圖瓦內特，你的嘴真聰明。
Toinette, you have such a clever mouth.

1097
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:04,375
梅爾索先生將免費享用。
Monsieur Mersault will enjoy it for free.

1098
01:35:04,917 --> 01:35:06,500
去。現在。
Go. Now.

1099
01:35:07,208 --> 01:35:09,667
貝拉，在我辦公室一會兒。
Bella, a moment in my office.

1100
01:35:11,750 --> 01:35:14,458
你有看起來最美味的裂片。
You have the most delicious looking lobes.

1101
01:35:15,542 --> 01:35:16,458
謝謝。
Thank you.

1102
01:35:16,625 --> 01:35:17,625
我必須...
I must...

1103
01:35:21,417 --> 01:35:23,375
哦，對不起。我抽了血。
Oh, I am sorry. I drew blood.

1104
01:35:24,208 --> 01:35:25,292
這裡。
Here.

1105
01:35:27,833 --> 01:35:32,125
當我看到美麗、年輕的美麗時，有時我會屈服於自己。
I sometimes give in to myself
when I see beauty, young beauty.

1106
01:35:32,292 --> 01:35:33,792
有一天，親愛的...
For one day, my dear...

1107
01:35:33,958 --> 01:35:36,958
你將成為一個充滿皺紋的老軀殼。
you will be a wrinkled, old husk.

1108
01:35:37,125 --> 01:35:41,542
沒有人會希望您付費或免費獲得它。
And no one will want you either
to pay you for it or to have it for free.

1109
01:35:42,208 --> 01:35:44,875
我仍然相信，如果我們可以選擇，每個人都會更快樂。
I still believe everyone would be happier
if we could choose.

1110
01:35:45,042 --> 01:35:46,500
一個理想主義者。
An idealist.

1111
01:35:46,667 --> 01:35:47,833
像我這樣的。
Like me.

1112
01:35:48,458 --> 01:35:50,750
你是多麼令人愉快。
How delightful you are.

1113
01:35:50,917 --> 01:35:55,167
但有時我們必須屈服於世界的要求。
But we must give in to the demands
of the world sometimes.

1114
01:35:55,333 --> 01:35:57,042
與它搏鬥，試著打敗它。
Grapple with it, try to defeat it.

1115
01:35:57,208 --> 01:35:59,500
- 所以你跟我一樣相信嗎？- 當然。
- So you believe as me?
- Of course.

1116
01:35:59,667 --> 01:36:03,792
但有些男人卻享受你不喜歡的感覺。
But some men enjoy that you do not like it.

1117
01:36:03,958 --> 01:36:04,833
什麼？
What?

1118
01:36:06,542 --> 01:36:07,625
- 那是... - 生病了。
- That is...
- Sick.

1119
01:36:07,792 --> 01:36:09,583
不過生意不錯。
But good business.

1120
01:36:10,208 --> 01:36:11,458
跟我來。
Come with me.

1121
01:36:16,458 --> 01:36:17,875
我的孫子。
My grandchild.

1122
01:36:18,667 --> 01:36:21,958
生病而且身體不好，需要大量的醫生治療。
Sick and poorly,
and requiring much doctoring.

1123
01:36:22,125 --> 01:36:26,792
我給你選擇的選擇將會危害我的生意。
My choice of giving you choice
will jeopardize the business.

1124
01:36:26,958 --> 01:36:28,583
她的健康。她的一生。
Her health. Her life.

1125
01:36:28,750 --> 01:36:31,125
- 你想要那個嗎，貝拉？- 當然不是。
- Do you want that, Bella?
- Of course not.

1126
01:36:31,292 --> 01:36:33,083
你不這麼認為嗎？你真可愛。
You don't? You're so lovely.

1127
01:36:35,208 --> 01:36:36,917
我以為你是衝著我的肺葉去的
I thought you were going for my lobes.

1128
01:36:38,792 --> 01:36:40,125
我們必須工作。
We must work.

1129
01:36:40,958 --> 01:36:43,250
我們必須賺錢。
We must make money.

1130
01:36:43,417 --> 01:36:46,750
但更重要的是，我們必須經歷一切......
But more than that,
we must experience everything...

1131
01:36:46,917 --> 01:36:48,125
不僅僅是好的。
not just the good.

1132
01:36:48,292 --> 01:36:51,458
但墮落、恐懼、悲傷…
But degradation, horror, sadness...

1133
01:36:51,625 --> 01:36:54,083
這讓我們變得完整，貝拉。
This makes us whole, Bella.

1134
01:36:54,250 --> 01:36:56,375
使我們成為有內涵的人...
Makes us people of substance...

1135
01:36:56,542 --> 01:36:58,833
不是輕浮、未曾接觸過的孩子。
not flighty, untouched children.

1136
01:37:00,208 --> 01:37:01,958
然後我們就能認識世界。
Then we can know the world.

1137
01:37:03,042 --> 01:37:05,083
當我們了解這個世界時...
And when we know the world...

1138
01:37:05,250 --> 01:37:07,333
這個世界是屬於我們的。
the world is ours.

1139
01:37:08,375 --> 01:37:09,500
我要那個。
I want that.

1140
01:37:10,167 --> 01:37:11,625
現在...
Now...

1141
01:37:11,792 --> 01:37:13,583
去操某人吧...
go and fuck someone...

1142
01:37:13,750 --> 01:37:16,583
給我 10 法郎。
and bring me 10 francs.

1143
01:37:20,375 --> 01:37:22,750
首先，我建議進行一個小測驗。
First, I suggest a short quiz.

1144
01:37:23,583 --> 01:37:24,458
測驗？
A quiz?

1145
01:37:25,250 --> 01:37:27,042
你告訴我童年的記憶。
You tell me a childhood memory.

1146
01:37:29,875 --> 01:37:31,458
然後我講一個笑話。
Then I tell a joke.

1147
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:34,375
然後快速嗅了嗅…
Then a quick sniff...

1148
01:37:34,542 --> 01:37:37,708
如有必要，請快速浸泡在薰衣草油中。
and if necessary,
a quick douse in lavender oil.

1149
01:37:37,875 --> 01:37:42,458
所有這些都將增強體驗，使其變得更加強大。
And all of this will enhance the experience
making it formidable.

1150
01:37:45,667 --> 01:37:47,500
不，我講笑話。
Non, I tell the joke.

1151
01:37:47,667 --> 01:37:48,833
你這個記憶。
You the memory.

1152
01:37:59,042 --> 01:38:03,125
當你小的時候在希臘，你從自行車上摔下來過嗎？
When you were little in Greece,
you fell from your bicycle?

1153
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:11,542
血。順著我的腿下去。
Blood. Down my leg.

1154
01:38:15,625 --> 01:38:16,625
喜悅？
Joy?

1155
01:38:16,792 --> 01:38:18,375
你高興地看著血。
You watched the blood with joy.

1156
01:38:19,833 --> 01:38:20,917
敲，敲。
Knock, knock.

1157
01:38:24,333 --> 01:38:25,583
芝士來認識你。
Cheese to meet you.

1158
01:38:36,292 --> 01:38:37,375
你知道的。
You know it.

1159
01:38:41,708 --> 01:38:43,000
你聞起來還不錯。
You smell okay.

1160
01:38:43,167 --> 01:38:44,083
讓我們他媽的。
Let us fuck.

1161
01:39:29,625 --> 01:39:32,042
上帝給了你一份禮物，我的朋友。
God gave you a gift, my friend.

1162
01:40:12,792 --> 01:40:14,875
非常不優雅的工作。
Very inelegant work.

1163
01:40:15,042 --> 01:40:16,875
這就是你想家的時候所做的事？
This is what you do when you're homesick?

1164
01:40:32,042 --> 01:40:32,917
你想要什麼？
You wish what?

1165
01:40:33,083 --> 01:40:35,958
我的孩子們已經到了接受教育的年紀。性的。
My boys are of an age for education.
Sexual.

1166
01:40:37,583 --> 01:40:38,667
我會示範。
I will demonstrate.

1167
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:40,458
我懂了。
I see.

1168
01:40:48,250 --> 01:40:49,208
有時。
At times.

1169
01:41:03,833 --> 01:41:06,000
我要躺著、彎腰、跨騎嗎？
Shall I lay, bend, astride?

1170
01:41:06,333 --> 01:41:07,792
讓我們從簡單的開始。
Let's start simple, please.

1171
01:41:42,750 --> 01:41:44,125
為了幫助事情進展...
To aid things along...

1172
01:41:44,292 --> 01:41:46,042
- 一根手指插在屁股上。- 不。
- a finger in the arse.
- No.

1173
01:41:46,208 --> 01:41:48,250
或者輕微的窒息也可能導致這種情況。
Or a slight choking may do it.

1174
01:42:16,083 --> 01:42:17,417
回家！
Go home!

1175
01:42:24,958 --> 01:42:26,208
貝拉！
Bella!

1176
01:42:27,625 --> 01:42:29,458
斯威尼女士是對的。
Madam Swiney was right.

1177
01:42:29,625 --> 01:42:32,375
我正在發現自己迄今為止未知的部分。
I am discovering parts of myself
hitherto unknown.

1178
01:42:32,542 --> 01:42:34,083
這是一種看待它的方式。
It is a way to look at it.

1179
01:42:34,833 --> 01:42:38,083
各種慾望的表現令人著迷。
The variety of desires being made manifest
is fascinating.

1180
01:42:38,250 --> 01:42:39,083
你有沒有那個男人...
Have you had the man...

1181
01:42:39,250 --> 01:42:41,875
誰把一塊鳳梨放進你嘴裡，然後讓你沾滿灰塵？
who puts a wedge of pineapple in your mouth
and covers you in dust?

1182
01:42:43,542 --> 01:42:44,375
貝拉。
Bella.

1183
01:42:45,750 --> 01:42:47,375
我幾乎準備好原諒你了。
I'm almost ready to forgive you.

1184
01:42:47,542 --> 01:42:48,792
我已經訂好回家的床位了...
I've booked our berths home...

1185
01:42:48,958 --> 01:42:51,500
我已經告訴媽媽準備我們的婚床了。
and I've told Mother
to prepare our wedding bed.

1186
01:42:52,625 --> 01:42:54,375
你操過那個手上有鉤子的傢伙嗎？
Did you fuck that guy with hooks for hands?

1187
01:42:54,542 --> 01:42:56,042
你做到了。我知道！
You did. I know!

1188
01:42:56,750 --> 01:42:59,208
我把那傢伙的焦油打掉了。
I beat the tar out of that guy.

1189
01:42:59,375 --> 01:43:01,250
鄧肯. 我以為你離開了
Duncan. I thought you left.

1190
01:43:01,417 --> 01:43:03,792
回到船上，但開始疼痛並嘔吐...
Back to the ship,
but started to ache and vomit...

1191
01:43:04,083 --> 01:43:05,250
所以我是來救你的。
so I'm here to save you.

1192
01:43:05,417 --> 01:43:06,625
你好，鄧肯。
Hello, Duncan.

1193
01:43:09,917 --> 01:43:11,125
回家吧，鄧肯。
Go home, Duncan.

1194
01:43:11,292 --> 01:43:12,750
我們的時代已經結束了。
Our time has ended.

1195
01:43:12,917 --> 01:43:13,833
我看著你，卻什麼感覺也沒有…
I look at you and feel nothing...

1196
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,167
但揮之不去的問題是我如何想要你？
but the lingering question
of how did I ever want you?

1197
01:43:17,208 --> 01:43:19,000
我們必須去參加社會主義者的會議。
And we must go to the meeting of socialists.

1198
01:43:21,792 --> 01:43:23,125
你們是妓女。
You're whores.

1199
01:43:23,292 --> 01:43:25,583
我們是我們自己的生產資料。
We are our own means of production.

1200
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:26,833
離開。
Go away.

1201
01:43:39,458 --> 01:43:40,375
腳。
Foot.

1202
01:43:42,458 --> 01:43:43,625
油漆, 腳.
Paint, foot.

1203
01:43:43,792 --> 01:43:44,792
非常好。
Very good.

1204
01:43:48,292 --> 01:43:50,667
語言雖然緩慢但正在進步。
Language is slow but improving.

1205
01:43:50,833 --> 01:43:51,833
畫。腳。
Paint. Foot.

1206
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:52,917
天才。
Genius.

1207
01:43:53,875 --> 01:43:55,750
你能不能別對她這麼殘忍？
Can you not be so cruel to her?

1208
01:43:55,917 --> 01:43:57,458
我對貝拉犯了一個錯誤。
I made a mistake with Bella.

1209
01:43:57,625 --> 01:43:59,500
我允許感情發展。
I allowed feelings to develop.

1210
01:44:00,292 --> 01:44:03,917
沒有適合她的。她和雞狗沒什麼兩樣。
There are none for her.
She is no different to the chicken dog.

1211
01:44:04,083 --> 01:44:05,000
腳。
Foot.

1212
01:44:05,167 --> 01:44:07,083
也許這樣更好…
It is better this way, perhaps...

1213
01:44:07,250 --> 01:44:10,250
讓我了解到父親的冷靜。
and gives some insight
into my father's coolness to me.

1214
01:44:10,417 --> 01:44:13,042
這是科學的必然。
It was a necessity of science.

1215
01:44:13,208 --> 01:44:14,333
天哪，夥計。
Good God, man.

1216
01:44:14,542 --> 01:44:17,083
- 腳。- 我不指望你能理解...
- Foot.
- I do not expect you to understand...

1217
01:44:17,250 --> 01:44:18,500
鄉村醫生。
village doctor.

1218
01:44:19,708 --> 01:44:22,208
順便說一句，我需要你幫我做手術。
By the way, I need you to operate on me.

1219
01:44:22,667 --> 01:44:24,917
我應該將一顆跳動的心臟放入你的怪物形態中嗎？
Shall I put a beating heart
in your monstrous form?

1220
01:44:25,833 --> 01:44:27,083
如果你有時間...
If you have time...

1221
01:44:27,917 --> 01:44:29,167
當採取...
while taking...

1222
01:44:31,250 --> 01:44:32,333
這個出來了。
this out.

1223
01:44:49,667 --> 01:44:52,375
我會切除腫瘤周圍的一些囊腫。
I'll remove some cysts from around the tumor.

1224
01:44:52,542 --> 01:44:55,083
不需要。你可以把我關起來。
No need. You may close me up.

1225
01:44:55,917 --> 01:44:58,500
它已經蔓延了。我看到微小的息肉。
It has spread. I see tiny polyps.

1226
01:45:01,667 --> 01:45:02,958
我快死了。
I am dying.

1227
01:45:03,125 --> 01:45:05,458
怎麼把它給病人，嗯？
How to break it to the patient, eh?

1228
01:45:06,292 --> 01:45:07,292
巴克斯特...
Baxter...

1229
01:45:07,458 --> 01:45:10,500
不要哭到傷口！你會因為敗血症而更快殺死我。
Do not cry into the wound!
You'll kill me faster with sepsis.

1230
01:45:11,208 --> 01:45:12,042
現在安靜了。
Quiet now.

1231
01:45:12,208 --> 01:45:13,625
並把我關起來。
And close me up.

1232
01:45:15,250 --> 01:45:16,625
找她。
Find her.

1233
01:45:22,042 --> 01:45:23,625
我關門了。
I am closed.

1234
01:45:30,792 --> 01:45:32,667
熱巧克力，親愛的。
Hot chocolate, my dear.

1235
01:45:32,833 --> 01:45:34,917
還有巧克力的痛苦。
And pain au chocolat.

1236
01:45:43,292 --> 01:45:44,375
你是我的最愛。
You are my favorite.

1237
01:45:46,708 --> 01:45:49,333
我聽你對其他人說過這樣的話。
I have heard you say that to the others.

1238
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:52,917
我們是一台你用讚美和巧克力餵養的機器。
We are a machine you feed
with compliments and chocolate.

1239
01:45:53,083 --> 01:45:55,250
你們是我的孩子，我用愛餵養。
You are my children I feed with love.

1240
01:46:01,875 --> 01:46:04,833
發生了可怕的事情，斯威尼。
Something terrible has happened, Swiney.

1241
01:46:05,458 --> 01:46:07,417
我幾乎什麼感覺都沒有。
I feel almost nothing.

1242
01:46:08,917 --> 01:46:12,125
我的同理心正逐漸朝著我所描述的方向發展…
My empathy is creeping
toward what I would describe...

1243
01:46:12,292 --> 01:46:14,417
作為輕蔑的憤怒。
as contemptuous rage.

1244
01:46:14,583 --> 01:46:16,333
這太棒了。
This is fabulous.

1245
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:17,333
這是？
It is?

1246
01:46:20,417 --> 01:46:22,458
你正處於黑暗時期。
You're in the dark period.

1247
01:46:23,333 --> 01:46:26,250
在光明和智慧降臨到你之前。
Before light and wisdom come to you.

1248
01:46:27,625 --> 01:46:29,458
你必須克服它...
You must forge through it...

1249
01:46:30,250 --> 01:46:31,833
一旦到了另一邊...
and once on the other side...

1250
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:36,458
你會感激這一刻，但你必須繼續前進。
you will be grateful to this moment,
but you must keep going.

1251
01:46:36,667 --> 01:46:37,708
我懂了。
I see.

1252
01:47:53,625 --> 01:47:55,042
你有嬰兒傷疤。
You've got a baby scar.

1253
01:47:58,042 --> 01:47:59,333
我的和媽媽一起。
Mine is with ma maman.

1254
01:48:01,625 --> 01:48:02,792
我沒有。
I don't have one.

1255
01:48:04,125 --> 01:48:06,292
這是事故留下的疤痕。
It is an accident scar.

1256
01:48:06,458 --> 01:48:08,875
但你並不是第一個犯這個錯的人。
But you're not the first
to have made the mistake.

1257
01:48:09,042 --> 01:48:10,125
為什麼說謊？
Why lie?

1258
01:48:11,083 --> 01:48:12,250
我不是說假話。
I'm not lying.

1259
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:14,750
我的戈德溫親口告訴我的。
My Godwin told me himself.

1260
01:48:32,667 --> 01:48:33,792
韋德伯恩。
Wedderburn.

1261
01:48:58,792 --> 01:48:59,917
美好的一天，先生。
Good day, sir.

1262
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:06,333
您寫信給戈德溫‧巴克斯特先生。
You wrote to Mr. Godwin Baxter.

1263
01:49:06,667 --> 01:49:08,958
他派出了一個逍遙法外的惡魔到這個世界。
He has sent a demon at large into the world.

1264
01:49:09,125 --> 01:49:12,542
惡魔包裹在無法滿足的誘人肉體中…
The devil's wrapped in an alluring body
that cannot be satiated...

1265
01:49:12,708 --> 01:49:15,708
以及一顆將人們一針一線分開的心靈…
and a mind that picks people apart
stitch by stitch...

1266
01:49:15,875 --> 01:49:19,417
就像從大象屁股拉出來的一個血跡斑斑、燒焦的布娃娃。
like a bloodied and burned rag doll
shat out of an elephant's arse.

1267
01:49:19,583 --> 01:49:20,333
貝拉。
Bella.

1268
01:49:21,083 --> 01:49:22,167
她在哪？
Where is she?

1269
01:49:22,333 --> 01:49:23,292
你是誰？
Who are you?

1270
01:49:23,458 --> 01:49:25,125
我是她的未婚夫 先生
I'm her fiancé, sir.

1271
01:49:29,292 --> 01:49:32,000
顯然，你們之間的事並沒有好結果。
Obviously, things did not end well
between you.

1272
01:49:32,167 --> 01:49:33,208
沒有？
Did not?

1273
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,333
她毀了我。
She destroyed me.

1274
01:49:35,500 --> 01:49:38,417
好吧，我們都是自己這艘船的主人，長官。
Well, we're all masters of our own ship, sir.

1275
01:49:38,583 --> 01:49:39,333
就是這樣。
There's that.

1276
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:42,708
我不喜歡你或你的話。
I do not like you or your words.

1277
01:49:42,875 --> 01:49:44,125
那個戈德溫·巴克斯特。
That Godwin Baxter.

1278
01:49:44,292 --> 01:49:46,333
他知道，所以他叫她來找我。
He knew, and he set her on to me.

1279
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:47,375
他困住了我。
He trapped me.

1280
01:49:49,375 --> 01:49:50,125
她在哪？
Where is she?

1281
01:49:50,292 --> 01:49:53,208
不希望她成為我最大的敵人。
Would not wish her on my worst enemy.

1282
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,667
我會把你從她手中救出來，先生。
I shall save you from her, sir.

1283
01:50:11,292 --> 01:50:13,625
原諒我的沮喪。就告訴我嘛。
Forgive my frustration. Just tell me.

1284
01:50:13,792 --> 01:50:15,500
它不痛。
It does not hurt.

1285
01:50:15,667 --> 01:50:17,917
我沒有內臟。
I have no insides.

1286
01:50:18,083 --> 01:50:19,875
她把我掏空了。
She hollowed me out.

1287
01:50:20,042 --> 01:50:22,250
我的靈魂。我的銀行帳戶！
My soul. My bank account!

1288
01:50:22,833 --> 01:50:24,125
我是一個蟲！如地獄！
I am a bug! A shell!

1289
01:50:24,292 --> 01:50:25,292
我們唱歌吧？
Shall we sing?

1290
01:50:25,458 --> 01:50:27,625
哦，我們是水手...
Oh, we are sailors...

1291
01:50:27,792 --> 01:50:28,708
它不...
It doesn't...

1292
01:50:30,833 --> 01:50:32,250
不疼。
Doesn't hurt.

1293
01:50:34,375 --> 01:50:36,208
我不希望事情變成這樣。
I do not wish it to be like this.

1294
01:50:37,583 --> 01:50:38,625
你強迫我的手。
You force my hand.

1295
01:50:38,833 --> 01:50:41,333
“我們都是自己這艘船的主人。”
"We're all masters of our own ship."

1296
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:44,292
你這個滿嘴賤貨的死東西。
You cunting cunt-faced deadshit.

1297
01:50:44,708 --> 01:50:45,750
請。
Please.

1298
01:50:45,917 --> 01:50:47,583
我盡可能禮貌地問你。
I ask you as politely as I can.

1299
01:50:47,750 --> 01:50:49,583
她在哪？
Where is she?

1300
01:51:45,875 --> 01:51:47,625
妓女回來了。
The whore is back.

1301
01:51:52,792 --> 01:51:53,625
上帝？
God?

1302
01:51:53,792 --> 01:51:55,083
貝拉！
Bella!

1303
01:51:55,250 --> 01:51:56,708
麥克斯寫信給我。
Max wrote me.

1304
01:51:56,875 --> 01:51:59,167
- 你生病了？- 我不是。我快死了。
- You are ill?
- I am not. I am dying.

1305
01:51:59,333 --> 01:52:03,125
這是一個微妙的差異，但作為一名醫生，我認真對待這一差異。
A subtle difference,
but one I take seriously as a physician.

1306
01:52:03,292 --> 01:52:05,000
你是一道風景，也是個好人。
You are a sight and a good one.

1307
01:52:05,167 --> 01:52:06,000
你不能死。
You cannot die.

1308
01:52:06,167 --> 01:52:08,375
經驗數據的說法不同。
Empirical data says different.

1309
01:52:09,750 --> 01:52:10,625
我很想念你。
I missed you.

1310
01:52:11,917 --> 01:52:14,833
我現在必須躺下。
I now have to lie down.

1311
01:52:21,042 --> 01:52:22,833
我帶來的並不全是陽光。
It is not all sunshine I bring.

1312
01:52:24,417 --> 01:52:27,125
我還帶來了明亮的眼睛和尖銳的問題。
I also bring beady eyes and hard questions.

1313
01:52:28,833 --> 01:52:30,333
我心裡有小孩嗎？
Did I have a baby in me?

1314
01:52:31,250 --> 01:52:32,500
如果是的話，它在哪裡？
And if so, where is it?

1315
01:52:32,667 --> 01:52:33,750
我懂了。
I see.

1316
01:52:34,875 --> 01:52:38,583
好吧，從技術上講，你是你的孩子。
Well, technically, you are your baby.

1317
01:52:38,750 --> 01:52:41,458
而且，我想你是你的母親。
And also, I suppose you are your mother.

1318
01:52:41,625 --> 01:52:43,458
也都不是。
And also neither.

1319
01:52:43,625 --> 01:52:45,417
沒有記憶倖存。
No memory survives.

1320
01:52:45,583 --> 01:52:47,250
任何經歷都無法生存。
No experiences survive.

1321
01:52:48,250 --> 01:52:50,333
我是母女是什麼意思？
What do you mean I am mother and daughter?

1322
01:53:08,458 --> 01:53:10,042
你知道但沒有告訴。
You knew and did not tell.

1323
01:53:10,208 --> 01:53:13,250
我沒有看到好的理由。
I did not see good reason to.

1324
01:53:13,417 --> 01:53:14,542
而且我們太膽怯了。
And were too cowardly to.

1325
01:53:14,708 --> 01:53:16,333
也有一點這樣的。
A bit of that as well.

1326
01:53:17,833 --> 01:53:19,375
我想和你在一起...
I wanted to be with you...

1327
01:53:19,833 --> 01:53:22,167
我不確定你是否能理解。
and I was not sure you would even understand.

1328
01:53:22,333 --> 01:53:25,750
巴克斯特有點讓人成為他的俘虜。
And Baxter kind of makes one a prisoner
to him.

1329
01:53:25,917 --> 01:53:27,125
而我是...
And I am...

1330
01:53:30,417 --> 01:53:31,250
對不起。
I'm sorry.

1331
01:53:42,250 --> 01:53:43,167
嘭。
Bam.

1332
01:53:44,375 --> 01:53:45,417
嘭。
Bam.

1333
01:53:46,583 --> 01:53:47,500
嘭。
Bam.

1334
01:53:48,708 --> 01:53:49,708
嘭。
Bam.

1335
01:53:50,875 --> 01:53:51,958
嘭。
Bam.

1336
01:53:52,917 --> 01:53:53,875
嘭。
Bam.

1337
01:53:55,167 --> 01:53:56,167
嘭。
Bam.

1338
01:53:56,333 --> 01:53:57,333
這是誰？
Who is this?

1339
01:53:57,500 --> 01:53:59,500
貝爾妓女
Bell whore

1340
01:53:59,708 --> 01:54:01,792
- 貝爾妓女 - 我看到你已經介紹我了，波麗姆。
- Bell whore
- I see you've introduced me then, Prim.

1341
01:54:01,958 --> 01:54:03,833
- 不過我喜歡這個。 - 貝爾妓女
- I like this one though.
- Bell whore

1342
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:05,917
- 現在夠了，費莉西蒂... - 貝爾妓女
- That's enough now, Felicity...
- Bell whore

1343
01:54:06,667 --> 01:54:07,542
笨蛋。
Fucker.

1344
01:54:09,083 --> 01:54:09,917
另一個？
Another one?

1345
01:54:10,792 --> 01:54:11,833
我們想你。
We missed you.

1346
01:54:12,208 --> 01:54:13,542
怪物。
Monsters.

1347
01:54:15,333 --> 01:54:16,833
噢，該死的。
Oh, fucking hell.

1348
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:18,958
貝爾妓女
Bell whore

1349
01:54:19,125 --> 01:54:20,750
貝爾妓女
Bell whore

1350
01:54:58,458 --> 01:55:01,375
處於想要打人的位置是很困難的…
It is hard to be in the position
where one wants to hit someone...

1351
01:55:01,542 --> 01:55:03,417
誰已經處於明顯的痛苦之中。
who is already in obvious pain.

1352
01:55:03,583 --> 01:55:06,375
這肯定是一個難題。
It is a conundrum for sure.

1353
01:55:08,125 --> 01:55:12,083
你願意成為一塊鼻子裡插著魚鉤的灰色肉塊嗎？
Would you rather be a gray slab of flesh
with a fishhook in your nose?

1354
01:55:12,250 --> 01:55:15,167
我會感覺良好一秒鐘，但會感覺更糟糕，所以......
I will feel good for a second,
but bad for longer, so...

1355
01:55:16,625 --> 01:55:18,208
我鼻子真的有魚鉤嗎？
I really had a fishhook in my nose?

1356
01:55:18,375 --> 01:55:19,417
你做到了。
You did.

1357
01:55:21,625 --> 01:55:23,500
所以，我是你的創造物…
So, I am your creation...

1358
01:55:25,333 --> 01:55:26,375
另一個也是如此。
as is the other one.

1359
01:55:26,542 --> 01:55:28,042
你們都不是那樣的人。
Neither of you are that.

1360
01:55:28,208 --> 01:55:31,083
她拿著錘子，唱著歌在大廳裡漫步…
She wanders the halls
with a hammer and a song...

1361
01:55:31,250 --> 01:55:32,833
那不是我做的。
and that is not my doing.

1362
01:55:33,458 --> 01:55:35,625
我讀了你的卡片和回家的信......
And I read your cards and letters home...

1363
01:55:35,792 --> 01:55:39,208
看著你無所畏懼地創造出貝拉·巴克斯特，並驚嘆不已。
and watched you fearlessly
create Bella Baxter with wonder.

1364
01:55:39,375 --> 01:55:43,083
我發現活著很有趣，所以我會原諒你的行為...
I am finding being alive fascinating,
so I'll forgive you the act...

1365
01:55:43,917 --> 01:55:46,167
但始終討厭隨之而來的謊言和陷阱。
but always hate the lies and trapping
that followed.

1366
01:55:47,125 --> 01:55:48,292
明白了。
Understood.

1367
01:55:53,750 --> 01:55:54,875
很高興見到你。
Good to see you.

1368
01:55:55,042 --> 01:55:56,333
你也是。
You too.

1369
01:55:57,792 --> 01:56:00,958
拋開憤怒、困惑和大腦失調不談，我想念你。
Anger, confusion, and brain dissonance aside,
I missed you.

1370
01:56:02,292 --> 01:56:04,333
回到家，我聞到了甲醛的味道…
I arrived home,
and I smelled the formaldehyde...

1371
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:05,958
我知道接下來會發生什麼事。
and I knew what is next.

1372
01:56:08,667 --> 01:56:09,958
我會成為一名醫生。
I will be a doctor.

1373
01:56:11,333 --> 01:56:13,417
我的手術就是你的了。
My surgery is yours.

1374
01:56:15,292 --> 01:56:16,583
我父親曾經告訴我...
My father once told me...

1375
01:56:17,833 --> 01:56:20,792
總是懷著慈悲心去雕刻。
always carve with compassion.

1376
01:56:20,958 --> 01:56:22,958
他真是個白痴。
He was a fucking idiot.

1377
01:56:23,125 --> 01:56:25,583
但這並不是一個壞建議。
But it's not bad advice.

1378
01:56:28,750 --> 01:56:30,375
他的時間不多了。
He does not have long.

1379
01:56:31,417 --> 01:56:32,542
我知道。
I know.

1380
01:56:33,917 --> 01:56:35,833
你還沒提到我們訂婚的事。
You've not mentioned our betrothal.

1381
01:56:37,667 --> 01:56:39,583
你年輕得多。
You were much younger.

1382
01:56:40,750 --> 01:56:42,042
沒有綁定。
There is no bind.

1383
01:56:42,208 --> 01:56:45,208
我被你迷住了，巴克斯特利用了這一點。
I was mesmerized by you,
and Baxter took advantage.

1384
01:56:45,375 --> 01:56:47,125
那麼，你不再著迷了嗎？
So, you are mesmerized no more?

1385
01:56:47,542 --> 01:56:50,375
我仍然著迷。
I am still mesmerized.

1386
01:56:50,958 --> 01:56:52,417
我曾經是個妓女，你懂嗎？
I've been a whore, you understand?

1387
01:56:53,375 --> 01:56:55,667
我體內的雞雞為了錢。
Cocks for money inside me.

1388
01:56:55,833 --> 01:56:56,958
你同意嗎？
You okay with that?

1389
01:56:57,792 --> 01:57:00,125
嫖娼的事情是否會挑戰慾望…
Does the whoring thing
challenge the desire...

1390
01:57:00,292 --> 01:57:02,125
為了男人擁有的所有權？
for ownership that men have?

1391
01:57:02,292 --> 01:57:04,667
韋德伯恩變得非常哭泣和咒罵...
Wedderburn became much weepy and sweary...

1392
01:57:04,833 --> 01:57:06,375
當他發現我嫖娼的時候。
when he discovered my whoring.

1393
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:10,750
我發現自己只是嫉妒男人們和你在一起的時間...
I find myself merely jealous
of the men's time with you...

1394
01:57:10,917 --> 01:57:13,958
而不是對你進行任何道德誹謗。
rather than any moral aspersion against you.

1395
01:57:14,125 --> 01:57:15,667
這是你的身體，貝拉·巴克斯特。
It is your body, Bella Baxter.

1396
01:57:15,833 --> 01:57:17,542
你的自由奉獻。
Yours to give freely.

1397
01:57:18,583 --> 01:57:20,083
我一般收30法郎。
I generally charged 30 francs.

1398
01:57:20,542 --> 01:57:22,833
嗯，這看起來很低。
Well, that seems low.

1399
01:57:24,042 --> 01:57:26,750
你相信人是可以進步的嗎，麥克斯？
Do you believe people improvable, Max?

1400
01:57:26,917 --> 01:57:27,750
我願意。
I do.

1401
01:57:27,917 --> 01:57:30,875
就像人體的疾病可以被治癒一樣...
Just as a human body
can be cured of illness...

1402
01:57:31,042 --> 01:57:34,375
所以男人和女人都可以治癒方面。
so can men and women be cured of aspect.

1403
01:57:36,583 --> 01:57:38,500
馬克斯·麥坎德爾斯，你願意嫁給我嗎？
Will you marry me, Max McCandles?

1404
01:57:40,750 --> 01:57:41,625
我會。
I will.

1405
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:50,542
以後我們會少用你的舌頭......
We will need less of your tongue
in the future...

1406
01:57:50,708 --> 01:57:52,417
但總的來說，最令人愉快的。
but overall, most agreeable.

1407
01:57:52,583 --> 01:57:54,417
我會記下那張紙條。
I will take that note.

1408
01:57:56,292 --> 01:57:59,542
還有你檢查過有沒有疾病嗎？
And have you been checked for disease?

1409
01:57:59,708 --> 01:58:01,458
我沒有，但我會的。
I have not, but I shall.

1410
01:58:02,125 --> 01:58:04,292
我很享受我們之間這種實際的愛。
I'm enjoying this practical love we have.

1411
01:58:06,208 --> 01:58:09,375
但我向你保證我也充滿熱情。
But I assure you mine is also passionate.

1412
01:58:10,208 --> 01:58:11,542
你好可愛。
You are adorable.

1413
01:58:12,333 --> 01:58:13,500
你一直都是。
You always were.

1414
01:58:23,417 --> 01:58:24,750
天啊，你在行走。
God, you are walking.

1415
01:58:24,917 --> 01:58:28,417
我因疼痛而透過腳趾注射了五毫克海洛因...
I have taken five milligrams of heroin
through the toes for pain...

1416
01:58:28,583 --> 01:58:29,875
安非他明作為能量...
amphetamines for energy...

1417
01:58:30,042 --> 01:58:33,667
和可卡因，因為我偏愛可卡因。
and cocaine because I am partial to cocaine.

1418
01:58:33,833 --> 01:58:36,833
我來這裡是為了陪你走上紅毯。
I've come here to walk you down the aisle.

1419
01:58:49,500 --> 01:58:52,333
因此，根據教會賦予我的權力......
And so, by the powers vested in me
by the church...

1420
01:58:52,500 --> 01:58:54,250
我將為這次結合舉行隆重儀式。
I shall solemnize this union.

1421
01:58:55,375 --> 01:58:59,208
貝拉·巴克斯特，你願意接受這個男人當你的丈夫嗎？
Do you, Bella Baxter,
take this man as your husband?

1422
01:58:59,375 --> 01:59:02,167
我們是否錯過了關於有人反對這一點的部分？
Did we miss the part
about anyone objecting to this?

1423
01:59:02,792 --> 01:59:07,708
或者說，這一點已經在教義問答的某種虛假現代化中被刪除了？
Or has that been removed in some kind
of faux modernization of the catechism?

1424
01:59:11,042 --> 01:59:12,458
你好，維多利亞。
Hello, Victoria.

1425
01:59:13,208 --> 01:59:14,250
你看起來不錯。
You look well.

1426
01:59:15,417 --> 01:59:17,375
先生，您指的是我嗎？
Do you refer to me, sir?

1427
01:59:17,542 --> 01:59:20,250
男人通常不會向妻子介紹自己。
A man doesn't normally introduce himself
to his wife.

1428
01:59:20,417 --> 01:59:21,875
但如果我必須...
But if I must...

1429
01:59:23,250 --> 01:59:24,750
他是這一切的神。
He is the God of it.

1430
01:59:25,375 --> 01:59:27,958
我不知道是他在她的掌控之中，還是她在他的掌控之中。
I do not know if he's in her power
or she in his.

1431
01:59:28,125 --> 01:59:30,125
這是魔鬼手頭上的工作。看！
'Tis Devil's work at hand.
Look!

1432
01:59:30,292 --> 01:59:33,167
他咳​​出的不是正常人的空氣，而是血液。
He coughs not air as a normal man
but blood.

1433
01:59:33,333 --> 01:59:35,125
他得了癌症，你這個白痴。
He has cancer, you fucking idiot.

1434
01:59:36,958 --> 01:59:37,792
鄧肯.
Duncan.

1435
01:59:37,958 --> 01:59:40,125
別用你的眼睛看著我，惡魔！
Do not lay your eyes on me, demon!

1436
01:59:42,333 --> 01:59:45,750
正如我所說，阿爾弗雷德·布萊辛頓將軍。
As I was saying, General Alfred Blessington.

1437
01:59:46,542 --> 01:59:48,167
“阿爾菲”給你。
"Alfie" to you.

1438
01:59:48,333 --> 01:59:49,792
你真的不認識我嗎？
You really do not know me?

1439
01:59:51,083 --> 01:59:53,250
當韋德伯恩先生把你的照片登在報紙上時...
When Mr. Wedderburn
put your photo in the paper...

1440
01:59:53,417 --> 01:59:57,833
我記得飯店裡那個老鳥叫你維多利亞·布萊辛頓…
I remembered that old bird in the hotel
called you Victoria Blessington...

1441
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:02,250
我把這個惡魔般的亂七八糟的拼圖拼湊在一起。
and I pieced this diabolical fuckfest
of a puzzle together.

1442
02:00:04,250 --> 02:00:06,083
- 你是... - 你親愛的阿爾菲。
- You are...
- Your dear Alfie.

1443
02:00:06,750 --> 02:00:11,417
在懷孕期間，您處於某種精神錯亂和歇斯底里的狀態。
You left in a state of some mental addlement
and hysteria over your pregnancy.

1444
02:00:12,625 --> 02:00:15,542
發現你不在後，我感到心如死灰。
On the discovery of your absence,
I felt disemboweled.

1445
02:00:16,208 --> 02:00:18,708
我在戰場上把人開膛破肚…
I have disemboweled men
on the field of battle...

1446
02:00:18,875 --> 02:00:23,208
我總是想像一種沉悶、空洞的悸動…
and I always imagined a dull,
hollow throbbing...

1447
02:00:23,708 --> 02:00:25,750
事情就是這樣。
and that is what it was like.

1448
02:00:26,625 --> 02:00:31,292
還有一股惡臭，但這並不適用於這裡作為比喻。
There's also a stench,
but that does not apply as a metaphor here.

1449
02:00:32,667 --> 02:00:34,500
但你在這裡，我親愛的。
But here you are, my darling.

1450
02:00:35,542 --> 02:00:36,417
給你。
Here you are.

1451
02:00:36,958 --> 02:00:37,875
上帝。
God.

1452
02:00:38,042 --> 02:00:39,833
我對你沒有任何記憶。
I have no recollection of you.

1453
02:00:40,708 --> 02:00:42,292
我是貝拉·巴克斯特。
I am Bella Baxter.

1454
02:00:42,458 --> 02:00:43,542
傷人的。
Hurtful.

1455
02:00:44,208 --> 02:00:45,667
但也許你已經撞到頭了......
But perhaps you've hit your head...

1456
02:00:45,833 --> 02:00:48,042
這些人顯然利用了你。
and these men have clearly taken
advantage of you.

1457
02:00:48,208 --> 02:00:49,958
請走吧，先生。
Please go, sir.

1458
02:00:51,708 --> 02:00:54,083
- 你是我的丈夫？- 你親愛的阿爾菲。
- You were my husband?
- Your dear Alfie.

1459
02:00:54,250 --> 02:00:56,375
貝拉，對不起。
Bella, I'm sorry.

1460
02:01:02,542 --> 02:01:04,208
其實我很想去。
Actually, I would like to go.

1461
02:01:04,792 --> 02:01:05,625
什麼？
What?

1462
02:01:05,792 --> 02:01:06,667
貝拉？
Bella?

1463
02:01:10,500 --> 02:01:12,042
先生，您有馬車嗎？
You have a carriage, sir?

1464
02:01:13,167 --> 02:01:14,250
是的。
Yes.

1465
02:01:14,417 --> 02:01:15,375
那我們走吧。
Let us go then.

1466
02:01:15,542 --> 02:01:16,417
貝拉！
Bella!

1467
02:01:16,583 --> 02:01:17,833
讓我走吧，上帝。
Let me go, God.

1468
02:01:18,583 --> 02:01:20,083
麥克斯，你不會阻止我的。
Max, you will not stop me.

1469
02:01:29,292 --> 02:01:31,333
很高興你回來了，維多利亞。
It is good to have you back, Victoria.

1470
02:01:47,792 --> 02:01:49,500
我和僕人相處得併不好。
The servants and I
have not been getting along.

1471
02:01:49,667 --> 02:01:51,083
我害怕起義。
I fear an uprising.

1472
02:02:01,167 --> 02:02:02,667
你還記得大衛嗎，親愛的？
You remember David, darling?

1473
02:02:04,875 --> 02:02:07,125
艾莉森，看看誰回來了。
Allison, look who's back.

1474
02:02:13,750 --> 02:02:14,958
你了解我？
You know me?

1475
02:02:16,792 --> 02:02:18,167
告訴我關於我自己的事。
Tell me about myself.

1476
02:02:20,625 --> 02:02:21,750
我很好嗎？
Was I nice?

1477
02:02:59,083 --> 02:02:59,917
吃。
Eat.

1478
02:03:01,458 --> 02:03:02,667
都是你的最愛。
All your favorites.

1479
02:03:02,833 --> 02:03:04,750
醃魚、鵝...
Kippers, goose...

1480
02:03:05,542 --> 02:03:08,083
舌頭, 香檳.
tongue, champagne.

1481
02:03:08,875 --> 02:03:09,875
我很想念你。
I've missed you.

1482
02:03:11,958 --> 02:03:13,958
不快樂的根源是什麼？
What was the root of the unhappiness?

1483
02:03:15,750 --> 02:03:17,958
到底是什麼原因讓她跳下橋呢？
What drove her to leap off the bridge?

1484
02:03:20,833 --> 02:03:22,500
你討厭這個孩子。
You hated the baby.

1485
02:03:22,667 --> 02:03:24,250
你稱它為「怪物」。
You called it "the monster."

1486
02:03:25,458 --> 02:03:26,542
我懂了。
I see.

1487
02:03:28,208 --> 02:03:30,500
我注意到缺乏母性本能。
I have noticed a lack of maternal instinct.

1488
02:03:32,167 --> 02:03:34,000
但我很高興你能回家。
And yet I'm happy to have you home.

1489
02:03:36,667 --> 02:03:37,792
我們是怎麼認識的？
How did we meet?

1490
02:03:38,458 --> 02:03:39,958
在一個舞會上。
At a ball.

1491
02:03:40,125 --> 02:03:41,542
我們為什麼互相喜歡？
Why did we like each other?

1492
02:03:43,125 --> 02:03:44,958
我們共同熱愛美好時光。
We shared a love of good times.

1493
02:03:46,750 --> 02:03:47,625
手錶。
Watch.

1494
02:03:49,167 --> 02:03:51,125
艾莉森，湯！
Allison, soup!

1495
02:04:00,917 --> 02:04:01,625
雷克斯！
Rex!

1496
02:04:07,583 --> 02:04:08,375
他媽的！
Fuck!

1497
02:04:08,542 --> 02:04:09,625
艾莉森...
Allison...

1498
02:04:10,375 --> 02:04:12,042
如果可以的話我們會吃一些起司。
we'll have some cheese when you can.

1499
02:04:18,542 --> 02:04:20,042
是對殘酷的熱愛嗎？
A love of cruelty?

1500
02:04:22,250 --> 02:04:25,208
- 看來我不是個善良的人。- 種類？
- I was not a kind person, it seems.
- Kind?

1501
02:04:25,833 --> 02:04:27,917
你永遠不會這麼遲鈍，維多利亞。
You would never be so dull, Victoria.

1502
02:04:28,083 --> 02:04:29,250
令人震驚的想法。
Appalling idea.

1503
02:04:30,458 --> 02:04:31,875
韋德伯恩說你是個妓女。
Wedderburn says you were a whore.

1504
02:04:32,042 --> 02:04:33,833
- 我懷疑那是一部分... - 我是。
- I suspect that was part...
- I was.

1505
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:34,833
在巴黎。
In Paris.

1506
02:04:35,375 --> 02:04:37,792
我厭倦了它，但它很迷人。
I tired of it, but it was fascinating.

1507
02:04:39,125 --> 02:04:41,750
- 正確的。- 這些醃魚非常美味。
- Right.
- These kippers are strangely delicious.

1508
02:04:42,500 --> 02:04:44,292
醋什麼的。
Vinegary or something.

1509
02:04:51,292 --> 02:04:53,375
婚姻是一個持續的挑戰。
Marriage is a constant challenge.

1510
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,500
有些，我們屈服，有些我們屈服。
Some, we bend to, some we bend to us.

1511
02:04:59,167 --> 02:05:01,292
我會盡力原諒你的嫖娼行為。
I will try to forgive you for the whoring.

1512
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:05,125
你的性歇斯底里常常失控。
Your sexual hysteria was often out of hand.

1513
02:05:05,833 --> 02:05:07,750
以及殺害我們未出生的孩子。
And for the killing of our unborn child.

1514
02:05:08,792 --> 02:05:11,250
事實上，當我列出你冤枉我的方式時...
In fact, when I list the ways
you've wronged me...

1515
02:05:11,417 --> 02:05:15,417
耶穌基督自己可能會用球棒敲打你的頭。
Jesus Christ himself would probably
beat your head in with a bat.

1516
02:05:19,208 --> 02:05:21,000
你很幸運有一個寬容的丈夫。
You're blessed with a forgiving husband.

1517
02:05:22,833 --> 02:05:24,667
我沒有冤枉你，阿爾菲…
I've not wronged you, Alfie...

1518
02:05:25,250 --> 02:05:26,625
因為我不認識你。
as I do not know you.

1519
02:05:26,792 --> 02:05:30,708
嗯，你很幸運，因為我在失憶症領域有很多經驗。
Well, you're in luck as I've had a lot
of experience in the field with amnesia.

1520
02:05:30,875 --> 02:05:33,583
要嘛是那些想忘記自己身在何處的人…
Either men who wish to forget
where they were...

1521
02:05:33,750 --> 02:05:35,667
或迫擊砲在附近爆炸.....
or a mortar exploded nearby...

1522
02:05:35,833 --> 02:05:37,875
像教堂的鐘聲一樣敲響他們的頭蓋骨。
ringing their cranium like a church bell.

1523
02:05:38,875 --> 02:05:41,750
我建議我們在房子附近待幾個月...
I suggest we stick close to the house
for several months...

1524
02:05:41,917 --> 02:05:43,083
也許一年。
maybe a year.

1525
02:05:45,875 --> 02:05:47,542
直到您完全康復。
Until you've made a full recovery.

1526
02:05:50,167 --> 02:05:53,708
我會在閒暇時離開，但你想困住我讓我受寵若驚。
I will leave at my leisure,
but I am flattered by your desire to trap me.

1527
02:05:55,917 --> 02:05:57,083
你不是第一個。
You're not the first.

1528
02:05:59,167 --> 02:06:01,375
我他媽得朝你的頭開槍…
I will have to shoot you
in the fucking head...

1529
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:03,833
如果你想離開，親愛的。
if you try to leave, darling.

1530
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:05,667
頭的前面還是後面？
The front or the back of the head?

1531
02:06:05,833 --> 02:06:07,167
背部。
The back.

1532
02:06:07,333 --> 02:06:08,708
為了確定你要離開...
As to be sure you were leaving...

1533
02:06:08,875 --> 02:06:10,667
我並沒有魯莽。
and I was not being rash.

1534
02:06:16,208 --> 02:06:17,750
我想念你。
I have missed you.

1535
02:06:21,667 --> 02:06:23,458
那麼，我是一個囚犯嗎？
So, I'm a prisoner?

1536
02:06:24,167 --> 02:06:27,167
這場談話走上了一條不幸的道路。
This conversation has gone down
an unfortunate route.

1537
02:06:28,208 --> 02:06:30,958
我相信你會像以前一樣快樂。
I am sure you will be as happy
as you were before.

1538
02:06:32,292 --> 02:06:34,833
和我之前從橋上跳下去時一樣嗎？
As I was before
when I threw myself from a bridge?

1539
02:06:41,167 --> 02:06:43,875
我懷疑你是在找魚的時候跌倒的。
I suspect you fell while looking for fish.

1540
02:06:45,583 --> 02:06:48,250
如果我不想留下來，為什麼要把我留在這裡？
Why would you want to keep me here
if I do not wish to stay?

1541
02:06:48,875 --> 02:06:53,208
如果一個人必須淹死，就讓它在愛河裡吧。
If one must drown,
let it be in the river of love.

1542
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:03,917
大衛...
David...

1543
02:07:05,292 --> 02:07:07,458
那隻雉雞看起來是不是被剝得只剩骨頭了？
does that pheasant look stripped to the bone?

1544
02:07:07,917 --> 02:07:09,750
這是一個誤判，先生。
It was a misjudgment, sir.

1545
02:07:10,375 --> 02:07:11,917
我道歉。
I apologize.

1546
02:07:20,250 --> 02:07:22,125
親愛的，甜點嗎？
Dessert, darling?

1547
02:08:20,417 --> 02:08:22,000
很容易脫落嗎？
It comes off easy?

1548
02:08:22,167 --> 02:08:23,583
就像西裝上的羈扣。
Like a button on a suit.

1549
02:08:24,958 --> 02:08:27,250
我在非洲看到他們用削尖的石頭做這件事...
I saw them do it in Africa
with sharpened rocks...

1550
02:08:27,417 --> 02:08:31,083
但我自己製作了更精確的設備。
but had my own more precise device made.

1551
02:08:32,875 --> 02:08:34,250
你想要的只是陰蒂罩...
Do you want just clitoral hood...

1552
02:08:34,417 --> 02:08:36,000
或者龜頭也是如此？
or glans as well?

1553
02:08:36,167 --> 02:08:37,958
整個地獄包。
The whole infernal packet.

1554
02:08:38,125 --> 02:08:40,042
這會讓她平靜下來。
It will calm her no end.

1555
02:08:40,208 --> 02:08:41,750
這次我們會完成它。
This time we will get it done.

1556
02:08:42,542 --> 02:08:44,708
今晚我會給她注射鎮定劑並帶她去你的手術室。
I shall get her sedated
and bring her to your surgery this evening.

1557
02:08:55,583 --> 02:08:57,875
維多利亞，親愛的！
Victoria, darling!

1558
02:08:59,208 --> 02:09:00,375
你在哪裡？
Where are you?

1559
02:09:05,875 --> 02:09:07,250
時間恰好。
Perfect timing.

1560
02:09:07,417 --> 02:09:08,292
馬提尼。
Martini.

1561
02:09:08,458 --> 02:09:09,708
而不是。
Rather not.

1562
02:09:10,250 --> 02:09:12,167
然而，我想離開。
I would, however, like to leave.

1563
02:09:12,625 --> 02:09:14,667
我發現我們在一起的時光很有趣...
I have found our time together interesting...

1564
02:09:14,833 --> 02:09:17,375
但我已經弄清楚為什麼我從橋上跳下去了。
but I've ascertained
why I jumped from a bridge.

1565
02:09:18,208 --> 02:09:20,750
我想見見我那瀕臨死亡的上帝。
I wish to go see my near dead God.

1566
02:09:21,375 --> 02:09:22,333
可愛的主意。
Adorable idea.

1567
02:09:22,500 --> 02:09:24,000
不幸的是，我親愛的...
Unfortunately, my darling...

1568
02:09:24,167 --> 02:09:27,250
我的一生致力於奪取領土。
my life is dedicated
to the taking of territory.

1569
02:09:27,417 --> 02:09:28,250
你是我的...
You are mine...

1570
02:09:28,417 --> 02:09:30,500
這就是它的長處和短處。
and that is the long and short of it.

1571
02:09:31,250 --> 02:09:32,708
我不是領地。
I am not territory.

1572
02:09:32,875 --> 02:09:36,500
問題的根源在於你的雙腿之間。
The root of the problem is between your legs.

1573
02:09:36,667 --> 02:09:37,667
我會把它摘下來...
I will have it off...

1574
02:09:37,833 --> 02:09:40,667
它不會再讓你分心或轉移注意力。
and it will not distract
and divert you anymore.

1575
02:09:40,833 --> 02:09:43,917
你看，一個男人一生都在與自己的性衝動奮戰。
You see, a man spends his life
wrangling his sexual compulsions.

1576
02:09:44,083 --> 02:09:47,208
這是一個詛咒，但從某些方面來說，這是他畢生的事業。
It's a curse and yet,
in some ways, his life's work.

1577
02:09:47,375 --> 02:09:49,417
女人一生的工作就是孩子。
A woman's life's work is children.

1578
02:09:49,583 --> 02:09:52,583
我打算把你兩腿之間的那個可惡的包去掉...
I intend to rid you of that infernal packet
between your legs...

1579
02:09:52,750 --> 02:09:55,000
然後立即在你身上種下一顆種子。
and plant a seed in you straight after.

1580
02:09:55,167 --> 02:09:57,417
讓我解釋一下發生了什麼事。
Let me explain what has happened.

1581
02:09:57,583 --> 02:10:01,417
你的妻子維多利亞從橋上跳下身亡。
Victoria, your wife, threw herself
from a bridge and died.

1582
02:10:01,583 --> 02:10:04,625
戈德溫·巴克斯特找到了她，帶她去了他的手術室。
Godwin Baxter found her,
brought her to his surgery.

1583
02:10:04,792 --> 02:10:07,917
然後他取出了嬰兒，取出了嬰兒的大腦...
He then removed the baby,
removed the brain from the baby...

1584
02:10:08,083 --> 02:10:11,042
將它移植到我的大腦中並讓我復活。
transplanted it into my head
and reanimated me.

1585
02:10:11,500 --> 02:10:13,917
我會把文件帶給你。這實際上非常令人著迷。
I'll bring you the file.
It's actually quite fascinating.

1586
02:10:14,083 --> 02:10:15,875
不過，我會繼續我的新生活…
However, I will keep my new life...

1587
02:10:16,042 --> 02:10:18,417
還有我可愛的老陰蒂，謝謝你。
and my lovely old clitoris, thank you.

1588
02:10:18,583 --> 02:10:20,208
如果你願意幫我叫一輛馬車的話。
If you'd call a carriage for me.

1589
02:10:21,042 --> 02:10:22,042
他們說啊說啊…
They talk and talk...

1590
02:10:22,208 --> 02:10:24,750
但到了某個時候，除了拔槍之外別無他法。
and yet at some point there's nothing left
but to pull a gun.

1591
02:10:26,333 --> 02:10:27,792
這就是對待女人的方式。
'Tis the way with women.

1592
02:10:40,750 --> 02:10:41,625
你屈服了嗎？
Are you giving in?

1593
02:10:42,792 --> 02:10:45,750
我寧願你朝我他媽的心臟開一槍。
I'd rather you shot me in the fucking heart.

1594
02:10:45,917 --> 02:10:48,208
如果有必要的話我會答應的。
I will oblige if I have to.

1595
02:10:49,833 --> 02:10:51,417
喝點飲料吧，親愛的。
Drink the drink, darling.

1596
02:10:52,292 --> 02:10:53,250
氯仿和杜松子酒。
Chloroform and gin.

1597
02:11:03,083 --> 02:11:06,875
從某些方面來說，擺脫自我探索會讓我鬆一口氣。
In some ways it would be a relief
to be rid of my questing self.

1598
02:11:07,375 --> 02:11:09,833
深深地啜飲，自由就屬於你了。
Sip deeply and that freedom is yours.

1599
02:11:22,583 --> 02:11:23,583
他媽的。
Fuck.

1600
02:11:38,333 --> 02:11:39,333
最大限度？
Max?

1601
02:11:42,542 --> 02:11:45,625
最大限度。我們必須讓他接受手術。
Max. We have to get him to surgery.

1602
02:11:46,500 --> 02:11:47,708
如果我們不這麼做他就會死
He'll die if we don't.

1603
02:11:47,875 --> 02:11:48,958
流血很多。
Bleeding a lot.

1604
02:11:49,125 --> 02:11:51,208
你他媽死定了。
You're fucking dead.

1605
02:11:52,333 --> 02:11:53,917
貝拉，如果他還活著的話…
Bella, if he lives...

1606
02:11:54,083 --> 02:11:57,542
我不認為他是一個會停下來的人。
I do not sense he is a man who will stop.

1607
02:11:58,042 --> 02:11:59,750
好吧，我不會看著他流血而死。
Well, I won't watch him bleed to death.

1608
02:12:00,292 --> 02:12:02,333
但我同意，他還需要改進。
But I agree, he could do with improvement.

1609
02:12:15,375 --> 02:12:17,375
我已經取出子彈並止血了。
I've removed the bullet
and stopped the bleeding.

1610
02:12:17,958 --> 02:12:19,292
我有筆記。
I have the notes.

1611
02:12:27,375 --> 02:12:29,792
我從來沒有比在這裡更開心的了。
I am never happier than when I'm in here.

1612
02:13:02,542 --> 02:13:04,000
貝拉。
Bella.

1613
02:13:04,167 --> 02:13:05,375
你回來了。
You're back.

1614
02:13:11,292 --> 02:13:13,750
這只是別人的故事…
It was just a story of someone else...

1615
02:13:14,958 --> 02:13:16,458
不是貝拉·巴克斯特。
not Bella Baxter.

1616
02:13:24,417 --> 02:13:27,375
我的一生，人們的目光都看著我......
All my life, people's eyes looked at me...

1617
02:13:27,542 --> 02:13:29,500
恐怖、可惜…
horror, pity...

1618
02:13:31,208 --> 02:13:32,375
但是你。
but you.

1619
02:13:39,917 --> 02:13:42,000
這一切都非常有趣...
It's all very interesting...

1620
02:13:44,042 --> 02:13:45,667
怎麼了。
what is happening.

1621
02:14:45,542 --> 02:14:47,458
解剖學考試讓我很緊張。
Anatomy exam is making me nervous.

1622
02:14:47,625 --> 02:14:50,042
我已經多次考驗你了。你知道的。
I've tested you many times. You know it.

1623
02:14:51,458 --> 02:14:53,458
沒有人比你更了解解剖學。
No one knows anatomy better than you.

1624
02:14:58,083 --> 02:14:59,208
女士們，琴酒嗎？
Ladies, gin?

1625
02:15:00,417 --> 02:15:01,083
請。
Please.

1626
02:15:01,625 --> 02:15:02,458
杜松子酒？
Gin?

1627
02:15:05,292 --> 02:15:07,708
我們應該要給將軍弄點水。
We should get some water for the general.

1628
02:15:13,917 --> 02:15:14,750
費莉西蒂...
Felicity...

1629
02:15:16,125 --> 02:15:16,958
水。
water.
