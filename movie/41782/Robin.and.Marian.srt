00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,228
Now!

2
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,318
See anything?

3
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,316
<i>You think it's deserted?</i>

4
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,873
<i>If they've left with the treasure,
Richard won't be pleased.</i>

5
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,355
If there ever was a treasure.

6
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,911
One more flight.

7
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,597
- John.
- Cease firing!

8
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,355
I speak for Richard Lionheart...

9
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,512
...King of England.
Lord of half of France...

10
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,479
...and thereby overlord
of this domain.

11
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,916
<i>I'm speaking for myself.</i>

12
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,230
- Where are your soldiers?
- Run off.

13
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,752
- Where is the Lord of Chaluz?
- He led them.

14
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,269
Ask if he knows about the treasure.

15
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,950
Left me with the women
and children and no weapons.

16
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,112
Here am I with one eye,
collecting arrows.

17
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,756
<i>And you think I've got a bow
to shoot them with?</i>

18
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,790
My king thinks your lord is keeping
treasure from him.

19
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,272
<i>It's my orders to get it.</i>

20
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,592
People say it was
found by Jean the ploughman.

21
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,873
<i>- Great gold statue, 3 foot long.
- That's the one.</i>

22
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,312
I was with him when they found it.
What we dug up was a rock.

23
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,671
<i>We're fighting for a rock?</i>

24
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,316
You wanna look?
Out there in the turnip field.

25
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,909
<i>We couldn't lift it, so we left it.</i>

26
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,712
<i>What I've come to say is...</i>

27
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,675
<i>...if there's to be a fight,
I'm all there is. Come and get me.</i>

28
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,110
<i>You're a mad old man.</i>

29
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,393
What now?

30
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,310
<i>I want to give that rock to Richard.
Let's find the turnip field.</i>

31
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,513
John.

32
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,631
What kind of siege is this?

33
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,390
<i>- Where's Lord Chaluz and my treasure?
- Gone.</i>

34
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,352
My treasure? Gone?

35
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,871
The lord is gone.
Your treasure never was.

36
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,358
A gold statue, 3 foot long.
I want it.

37
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,997
- Captain.
- Yes, my lord.

38
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,994
I ordered you to take this castle.

39
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,078
- Yes, my lord.
- Well, take it.

40
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,960
Bring it down and get my statue.

41
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,516
They surrender, and your statue
is a rock.

42
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,438
I want it done.

43
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,956
- There is no treasure.
- Do it.

44
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,912
There are no soldiers, just some
children and a mad old man.

45
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,712
<i>And what's that to me?</i>

46
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,309
Well, it should mean something.

47
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,354
Is that disapproval, Robin?
Am I in the wrong?

48
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,272
I followed you 20 years.

49
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,199
I fought in the Crusades and France.

50
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,595
<i>I'll fight a soldier...</i>

51
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,997
<i>...but I won't slaughter
children for gold.</i>

52
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,758
I ordered it.

53
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,311
I command you.

54
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,876
<i>You do it! You're a bastard,
you'll enjoy it.</i>

55
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,675
<i>Damn right I'll do it!
Mercadier!</i>

56
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,356
<i>Arrest those two!
I'll have their heads on pikes.</i>

57
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,195
I want these walls down. I want
every damned head!

58
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,913
Lionheart.

59
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,632
Lionheart!

60
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,119
You are a pig!

61
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,791
Good God!

62
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,719
Well...

63
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,109
...so it was a stone.

64
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,390
- Is this a barber surgeon?
- Yes, my lord.

65
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,239
I look after your men, sire.

66
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,998
- With much success?
- Yes.

67
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,158
<i>- You've seen to John and Robin?
- Under guard.</i>

68
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,157
Come on, come on.

69
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,869
<i>The patient's cold,
and the doctor sweats.</i>

70
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,032
The arrow will be hard to reach.

71
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,477
That should make it all
the more worthwhile.

72
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,834
Well, you heard it, Mercadier.

73
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,756
I told him to attack, he told me no.
I ought to kill him for it.

74
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,192
<i>- Will you?
- I don't know. It depends on my mood.</i>

75
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,719
I killed all of them this afternoon
except the old man. I liked his eye.

76
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,359
But, Robin...

77
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,233
<i>We've been friends, you see,
for 20 years.</i>

78
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,750
I met him in Nottingham
for the first time.

79
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,039
I needed men for the Crusade.
Robin was the best.

80
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,319
<i>Well, get on with it.
I'll die of old age at this rate.</i>

81
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,919
So off we went to do great things.

82
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,353
We led 300,000 men to the Holy Land,
and came back on a boat with 50.

83
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,593
Not at all what we intended.

84
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,594
Christ!

85
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,311
I do what has to be done.
I have no choice.

86
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,796
But Robin judges me.
He always does.

87
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,917
The peasant bastard!

88
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,315
Judge a king!

89
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,119
Butcher.

90
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,909
<i>I'll show you how it's done.</i>

91
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,717
<i>King's blood.</i>

92
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,109
Remember it.

93
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,671
<i>It's cold.</i>

94
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,916
<i>I don't like the dark.</i>

95
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,311
Mercadier, how long to Chaluz?
Half a league?

96
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,589
Sire.

97
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,715
<i>A little rest and then I'll attend
to John and Robin.</i>

98
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,675
What would you do?
Kill the women and children?

99
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,553
<i>But they're all dead
and we're in here.</i>

100
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,677
- No one forced you.
- You did.

101
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,791
You nodded.

102
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,715
What do you want me to do?

103
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,758
I know.

104
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,710
What did I get us into?

105
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,714
I could have talked to Richard.
I could have tried.

106
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,115
Well, he is a bloody bastard.

107
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,718
Are we any better?
We serve him.

108
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,039
<i>He's our king.</i>

109
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,151
I took him for a great king...

110
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,359
...when we were robbing abbots,
giving pennies to the poor.

111
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,957
<i>It didn't seem much compared
to rescuing the Holy Land.</i>

112
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,912
How can you eat?

113
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,511
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

114
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,356
<i>I reckon it's a good life
to have reached 40.</i>

115
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,233
<i>We've both passed it, and look at us!</i>

116
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,429
My poor old dad and all
the dads before him...

117
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,240
...lived in Barnesdale.

118
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,835
All they ever knew was one town.

119
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,753
<i>I've known a king...</i>

120
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,389
...travelled the world,
seen Jerusalem.

121
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:06,509
Oh, the sand was blowing and
the walls were miles away, but...

122
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,320
<i>I think I've had a good life.</i>

123
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,231
Do you think Richard will kill us?

124
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,716
<i>I don't know him anymore.</i>

125
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,070
<i>I don't know the man.</i>

126
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,279
Well, if we go, we go.

127
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,719
Is that your idea of dying?

128
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,118
<i>I don't know.</i>

129
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,517
<i>You'd think I'd learn.
I've seen enough of it.</i>

130
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,356
<i>I'll tell you something.
I won't go quietly.</i>

131
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,393
Come here.

132
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,913
Bend down.

133
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,951
<i>If I had not met you,
think what I'd have missed.</i>

134
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,592
The king will see you now.
Come on.

135
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,672
Your Majesty.

136
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,837
We are celebrating our demise.

137
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,508
I fancied leaving from a
larger stage.

138
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,029
But a funny fellow, my physician...

139
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,352
<i>I've already had him hanged.
It seemed fair.</i>

140
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,717
Wine! A bucket of it.

141
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,993
<i>But you're not for hanging.
You're for cutting up.</i>

142
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,993
<i>I would've done it already
but for this.</i>

143
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,395
- Will that be all, my lord?
- All?

144
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,790
<i>Damn your "all"!</i>

145
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,398
All done.

146
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,791
All over.

147
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,238
My father cursed me when he died.

148
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:15,118
<i>I killed him, and he felt resentful.
He'd have loved all this.</i>

149
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,509
I said a bucket.

150
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,512
A bucket!

151
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,155
<i>John's the next king.</i>

152
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,038
You remember John.

153
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,829
John Lackland they called him.
Now he gets all the land.

154
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,435
Christ, why did I have no children?

155
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,834
Never cared for England.
Never really there.

156
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,355
Not even as a corpse!

157
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,553
<i>They're planting me in France,
by my father!</i>

158
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,388
Take something, Robin.

159
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,474
Nothing, sire.

160
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,990
Oh, he sulks.

161
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:02,633
<i>He pouts. He gives his life
to Richard, and he's sorry.</i>

162
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,836
<i>You don't know sorrow.</i>

163
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,719
I was a king.

164
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,992
My mother...

165
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,909
<i>She'll be 80 soon, the bitch.</i>

166
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,192
<i>I've sent for her.
Do you think she'll come?</i>

167
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,512
Bucket.

168
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,310
Clever fellow, death is.

169
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:36,119
<i>I've tried to find him on my terms.
God knows I've tried.</i>

170
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,197
Ask for something, damn you!

171
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,358
<i>It's too late.
There's nothing left.</i>

172
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,513
<i>There's still your life.</i>

173
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,879
You take me as an equal.
You always did.

174
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,433
<i>I'll carve you yet,
you peasant bastard.</i>

175
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,999
Mercadier!

176
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,117
My sword!

177
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,355
<i>While I'm still king of England,
I'll...</i>

178
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,113
Richard!

179
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,549
<i>Richard. Richard, it's me.</i>

180
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,518
<i>I know it's you.</i>

181
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,439
<i>You couldn't leave me, could you?</i>

182
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,511
<i>You're free of me.</i>

183
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,711
<i>I'll let you go.</i>

184
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,390
What will you do without me now,
jolly Robin...

185
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,200
<i>...now I'm dead?</i>

186
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,149
<i>That's that.</i>

187
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,918
What now?

188
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,117
We watched him die. He saw us there.

189
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,118
<i>He won't mind if we miss the funeral.</i>

190
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,712
Where do we go? Which way?

191
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,915
North.

192
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,393
Why north?

193
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,477
<i>England's there.</i>

194
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,910
<i>Let's go home, John.</i>

195
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,552
There she is!

196
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,115
<i>I'll race you. Come on!</i>

197
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,552
<i>- You sure?
- Of course I'm sure.</i>

198
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,118
This way.

199
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:16,920
- A lot of thorns can grow in 20 years.
- I know these woods.

200
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,915
Good place to pass the night.

201
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,111
<i>We're going through.</i>

202
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,714
<i>What's that?</i>

203
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,319
- Deer.
- Deer?

204
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,113
<i>Someone's seen us. Come on.</i>

205
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,548
I can see it!

206
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,315
<i>- I can't even see you.
- That's the top of my tree.</i>

207
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,509
I told you this was the way.

208
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,797
<i>There's nothing left.</i>

209
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,555
What did you expect to find?

210
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,197
<i>I don't know. I never thought...</i>

211
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,518
John!

212
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,550
Quick, Robin.
There!

213
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,509
All right, boy.

214
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,114
<i>Jesus, Rob, mine's an old man!</i>

215
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,115
Rob, Rob... Robin?

216
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,397
<i>It's me, Tuck. Tuck and Will!</i>

217
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,472
Will? Will!

218
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,913
<i>Robin! You've come home!</i>

219
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,635
<i>And evil Prince John
Took one look at his sword</i>

220
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,714
<i>And fled to his castle
And prayed to the Lord</i>

221
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,912
<i>Follow him, follow him
Bloody and brave</i>

222
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:35,148
<i>I'll follow bold Robin
From here to the grave</i>

223
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,635
<i>They've turned us into heroes.</i>

224
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,472
<i>You didn't make it up?</i>

225
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,309
<i>I don't know where they come from.
They're everywhere.</i>

226
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,158
We go from town to town.

227
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,112
How do you make a living?

228
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,436
While I take confessions...

229
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,148
...he takes the horses.

230
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:56,194
Everywhere we go they want to hear
about your deeds.

231
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,719
<i>We didn't do them.</i>

232
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,911
I know that.

233
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,991
<i>I think I'll go to Barnesdale
in the morning. See my dad.</i>

234
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,714
He died, John. Years ago.

235
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,350
<i>Wouldn't have known me anyway.</i>

236
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,198
What happened here?

237
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,075
Did Marian...?
Is she still alive?

238
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,398
Last time we passed Nottingham.
She lives down Kirkly way.

239
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,149
<i>Lovely girl.
Haven't thought of her in years.</i>

240
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,628
And the sheriff?

241
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,196
Still rules the county,
as powerful as ever.

242
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,119
Those were good days, fighting him.

243
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,157
What about the rest of us?

244
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,191
They died or went away.

245
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,756
<i>When the Crusades ended
and you didn't come again...</i>

246
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,712
...we took you to be dead.

247
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,518
Like Richard.

248
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,153
Aye, Richard, well...

249
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,750
I mean, King John must be mad.

250
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,198
His own kind have turned on him.
The kingdom is falling apart.

251
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,799
His queen is 12 years old and
all he does is stay in bed with her.

252
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,513
<i>And you know he's fighting
with the pope.</i>

253
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:15,317
<i>You can't hear Mass or take Holy
Communion anywhere in England.</i>

254
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,556
The time for us is now.

255
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:22,237
The people would come to you
if you called them.

256
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,317
Fight the king?

257
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,950
Then why did you come back?

258
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,316
Not to fight.

259
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,910
Sing us a song, Will.
One that really happened.

260
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,031
About Marian.

261
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,512
<i>About Marian? Oh, aye.
Marian, now let's see...</i>

262
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,230
<i>Still, it would be something,
wouldn't it, Rob?</i>

263
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,710
Not at my age.

264
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,553
No!

265
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:12,313
All right, come on, you.
You too. Hack the post.

266
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,110
My arms are getting tired.

267
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,359
Dolt! Get up.

268
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,118
They never learn.

269
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,712
No, no, no.
Put your bloody weight behind it.

270
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,311
All right!

271
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,591
<i>I'll take two men at once.</i>

272
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,275
The rest of you pay attention.

273
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,799
You...

274
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,716
...and you.

275
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,758
Any questions?

276
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,513
Tie that rope over there.

277
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,472
My lord sheriff!

278
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,273
Yes, my lord.

279
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,637
<i>It's time to go.</i>

280
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,717
Sir Ranulf.

281
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:53,354
In my domain, never tell me,
always ask.

282
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,554
Taxes, what you got?
One egg. Put it down.

283
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:13,436
- One chicken, Sam the Herdsman.
- Slow down a bit.

284
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,595
<i>She won't be able to pay...</i>

285
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,113
You have to work and pay taxes
like anybody else.

286
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,118
<i>Hey! He's taken my egg.</i>

287
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,999
<i>He can't do that.
What am I gonna do?</i>

288
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,798
Now what am I gonna do?

289
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,398
Watch it.

290
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:49,511
<i>- Aren't we going to Nottingham?
- I thought we'd go by Kirkly first.</i>

291
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,429
<i>- Kirkly's this way.
- Aye, but Marian's up there.</i>

292
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,432
- Up there?
- Well, aye.

293
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,672
<i>- That's Kirkly Abbey.
- Aye, so it is.</i>

294
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,112
<i>What's she doing there?</i>

295
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,993
<i>She's lived there for 18 years.</i>

296
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,919
<i>A nun! She can't be!
Not my Marian.</i>

297
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,794
<i>You'll see.</i>

298
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:16,672
<i>- I won't know what to say.
- She'll think of something.</i>

299
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,595
This will help the pain.

300
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,191
Hello, the abbey!

301
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,993
Damn!

302
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,792
<i>Forgive me. It's the sheriff.
I have a busy day.</i>

303
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,999
Hello.

304
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,753
John, you go in.

305
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,157
I never said goodbye,
she might be angry.

306
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,991
Better yet,
leave it for another day.

307
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,113
You there!

308
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,630
What in hell do you want?

309
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,598
This is Kirkly Abbey?

310
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,991
<i>Yes, and I'm the abbess.
Who are you?</i>

311
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,116
<i>Good God, it's Marian.</i>

312
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,353
Robin.

313
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,672
- What are you doing in that costume?
- Living in it.

314
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,233
<i>Well, I've come home to you, Marian.</i>

315
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,597
<i>The wars are over.
I'm here.</i>

316
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,992
<i>It's Mother Jennet now.
You can trot right back to Jerusalem.</i>

317
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,428
<i>You're angry.</i>

318
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,640
<i>I haven't thought
of you in 20 years.</i>

319
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,720
Give me a smile.
Invite me in.

320
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,831
<i>Come back tomorrow.
I'll be gone.</i>

321
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,790
<i>- The sheriff's due. I'm off to prison.
- Off to prison?</i>

322
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,190
Marian! What did you say?

323
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,192
Damn the man!

324
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,070
<i>- Mother Jennet...
- They'll be here for me soon.</i>

325
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,477
<i>- You're in no danger, carry on.
- But...</i>

326
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:20,231
No services, but help all those
who come as best you can.

327
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,999
Marian.

328
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,472
<i>- What happened? Explain.
- I haven't time.</i>

329
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:31,913
<i>- But the sheriff? What did you do?
- God's work. That's what I do.</i>

330
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,950
- I can save you.
- I have nothing to be saved from.

331
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,515
<i>- I don't want you.
- You've got me.</i>

332
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,673
- I like the way you look.
- More than I can say for you.

333
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,431
So this is your room.
And I thought I knew you.

334
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,591
<i>What's happened to you?</i>

335
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,159
Good things.

336
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:06,638
<i>I work hard. I've studied herbs
and medicines. I love my life.</i>

337
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,230
<i>- And when the sheriff comes...
- What's he coming for?</i>

338
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,233
<i>I'm the abbess.</i>

339
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,632
<i>The king's ordered the clergy out
of England. I'm not going.</i>

340
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,310
<i>When he comes he'll find me
doing what I do.</i>

341
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,791
<i>- You mean to let him take you?
- God's with me.</i>

342
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,870
<i>- He didn't help us on the Crusades.
- Rob! Horsemen!</i>

343
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,038
<i>- Wait there.
- But it's my life, Robin.</i>

344
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,118
<i>You're a fool.</i>

345
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,391
How many are they?

346
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,352
- Six!
- I like the odds.

347
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,992
My lord sheriff.

348
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,472
Robin.

349
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,832
Still not dead?

350
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,031
Not for want of trying.

351
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,796
You look well,
all things considered.

352
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,194
- How was the Crusade?
- A disappointment.

353
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,432
After all these years, look at us.

354
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:21,070
<i>I'm just a former captain.
You're still the sheriff.</i>

355
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,589
No advancement.

356
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,513
I can read and write.
Makes you suspect.

357
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,196
Not a duke in 20 reads a word.
Correct, my lord?

358
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,994
Books are for clerks.

359
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,516
<i>How's Mother Jennet?
You find her changed?</i>

360
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,793
<i>I didn't find her. She'd gone off.</i>

361
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,033
Two decades and I missed her by a day.

362
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:50,075
<i>That's odd. I sent her warning
and she answered, " Come and get me. "</i>

363
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,589
<i>Well, we've both come for nothing.</i>

364
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,113
<i>- So be it.
- I'm ready.</i>

365
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,111
<i>- That's the woman?
- It is.</i>

366
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,436
<i>- By my authority...
- Who's this oaf?</i>

367
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,835
<i>- Sir Ranulf.
- I'm your prisoner.</i>

368
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,359
- Come back!
- Let go...

369
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,549
Release her!

370
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,671
<i>- Can't you grow up?
- I'm saving you.</i>

371
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,348
- Arrest them all.
- Not enough men.

372
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,438
<i>- I'm here. I'll do it.
- You'll what?</i>

373
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,438
<i>In King John's name,
I charge you. Yield!</i>

374
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,676
<i>I'm trying to.</i>

375
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,993
- Give her to me.
- Here.

376
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,396
- I warned him not to.
- Robin.

377
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,674
<i>Oaf or not, he serves the king.
You're still free.</i>

378
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,875
<i>- Let me have her and you can go.
- I can't do that.</i>

379
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,758
- Then I shall have to hunt you down.
- Good hunting, sheriff.

380
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,760
- God help you, Robin.
- Lf he will.

381
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,512
<i>So that's Robin Hood.</i>

382
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,638
<i>He's a dead man.</i>

383
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,389
Yes.

384
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,717
<i>But not just anyone's. He's mine.</i>

385
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,999
Can you get on your horse,
Sir Ranulf?

386
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,989
<i>- I didn't mean to hurt you.
- Nothing hurts.</i>

387
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,111
<i>I couldn't let them take you.</i>

388
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,392
Take me! I was going.

389
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,832
<i>I'll save you from prison.</i>

390
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,719
<i>- That I can do.
- It's none of your affair.</i>

391
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:38,037
<i>I don't know how I look,
but I'm not your Marian.</i>

392
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,516
<i>I can't imagine
living in the world again.</i>

393
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:47,158
<i>- Come morning I'll go to the sheriff.
- Why? Who would it serve?</i>

394
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,793
<i>There's always God.</i>

395
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,596
<i>- You went crusading, didn't you?
- Some things are worth dying for.</i>

396
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,589
They had souls too,
the heathen that you killed.

397
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:06,311
<i>If I should die in prison...
I'd rather not, but if it comes...</i>

398
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,112
<i>...it's for a reason.</i>

399
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:13,195
<i>I'll have stood for something.
But I won't have taken another life.</i>

400
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,430
What will you do now?
Fight the sheriff?

401
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,238
More corpses?

402
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,428
<i>Aren't you sick of it?</i>

403
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,236
On the 12th of July, 1191...

404
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,392
...the mighty Acre fortress
fell to Richard.

405
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,478
His one great victory
in the Holy Land.

406
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,035
He was sick and never fought.

407
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,831
On August 20th, John and I were
outside the city, watching...

408
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,959
...while every Moslem left alive was
marched out in chains.

409
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:52,996
King Richard spared the richest for
ransoming, took the strong for slaves.

410
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,391
And he took all the children
and had them chopped apart.

411
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:02,229
When that was done,
he had the mothers killed.

412
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:06,558
When they were all dead, 3000
bodies on the plain...

413
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,796
...he had them all opened up...

414
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,391
...so their guts could be explored
for gold and precious stones.

415
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,395
Our churchmen on the scene,
and there were many...

416
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,190
...took it for a triumph.

417
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,793
One bishop put on his mitre
and led us all in prayer.

418
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,829
<i>And you ask me if I'm sick of it.</i>

419
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,190
<i>Why didn't you come home then?</i>

420
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,878
He was my king.

421
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,992
Come. Walk with me.

422
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,516
<i>That's where the kitchen was...</i>

423
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,399
...and over there we stored the ale.

424
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,632
And this...

425
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,596
Was this our house?

426
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,031
As small as that?

427
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,191
The door was here.

428
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,593
I tried so hard to keep it clean.

429
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,270
I was right to love you
all those years ago.

430
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,640
<i>It's odd, I know I loved you...</i>

431
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,513
<i>...but I can't remember how it felt...</i>

432
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,790
...or who I was.

433
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,193
Of all things, I found peace
most difficult to come by.

434
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,991
I suppose I took the church up
out of anger.

435
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,834
<i>It's a blur,
but I think I thought...</i>

436
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,789
...of all men, you would mind
most if I married Jesus.

437
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,789
Not a good beginning.

438
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:12,396
<i>For months, when it was time to sleep,
I'd think of you.</i>

439
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:16,150
Oh, my confessions
were the envy of the convent.

440
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,831
I said endless prayers.
Did dreadful penance, but...

441
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,594
...nothing helped but time.

442
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,994
I have found peace.

443
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,189
<i>I don't dream about you
anymore, Robin.</i>

444
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,188
<i>I'll see you back safely
into Nottingham tomorrow.</i>

445
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,192
I think one of my teeth is loose.

446
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,396
I never mean to hurt you...

447
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,830
<i>...and yet it's all I ever do.</i>

448
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,798
You never wrote.

449
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,190
<i>I don't know how.</i>

450
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,157
Did you sleep well?

451
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,828
- Did you?
- To Nottingham then.

452
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:31,599
The abbey first. My things
were left behind, in the confusion.

453
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,837
<i>- Well, you'll have to ride with me.
- I always did.</i>

454
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,196
If you still know how.

455
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,231
<i>- It won't be long.
- Mother Jennet!</i>

456
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,318
<i>They've been taken.
We were in the garden.</i>

457
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,028
- The men came in.
- The sheriff and oaf?

458
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,630
We all ran. They caught
and took the others.

459
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,429
<i>- Took them all!
- Lf you'd kept out they'd be here now.</i>

460
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,638
<i>You think it's you he wants? It's me.</i>

461
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,791
<i>It's John and me.</i>

462
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,870
<i>- He's in his castle waiting.
- Take me to Nottingham.</i>

463
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,875
<i>- No, not you, we're going.
- I'll walk if I have to.</i>

464
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,799
<i>Take her to camp.
We'll join you later.</i>

465
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,600
<i>I wish I were a man.
I'd knock you down.</i>

466
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,196
<i>Now that's my Marian.</i>

467
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,993
Nottingham.

468
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,395
There she is, John.

469
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,152
You look ridiculous!

470
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,589
<i>He'll never come.</i>

471
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,998
I know him.

472
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:26,314
<i>He's a little bit in love with death.
He flirts. He teases.</i>

473
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,596
I can wait.

474
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,998
<i>They haven't changed a thing!</i>

475
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:15,312
- Shall we go on?
- Why not? See what there is to see.

476
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,913
No harm in that.

477
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,830
- See anything?
- Not yet.

478
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,032
<i>He knows we're coming.
He'll be waiting...</i>

479
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,474
...watching.

480
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,910
Not a soldier anyplace.

481
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,798
So far.

482
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:48,389
- Ah, Robin.
- Where?

483
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,994
<i>You can't see anything but a crowd.</i>

484
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,475
I see a wagon with three horses.

485
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,148
One to pull, but two to push?

486
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,033
<i>I'm almost sorry.</i>

487
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,234
Now. At once.

488
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,754
Aye, sir.

489
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,397
What now?

490
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:19,190
We set up shop. Do you see a table?

491
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,393
Hey!

492
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:31,998
<i>- Why not go out and get him?
- Why go out when he'll come in?</i>

493
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,798
There they are.

494
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:41,790
<i>It's no good being inside all day.
Walk where you like.</i>

495
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,794
<i>I don't understand what he means.</i>

496
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,394
Hey, there! You, lad!

497
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,434
<i>- That's not your table.
- It was empty.</i>

498
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,194
<i>No difference. What's mine's mine.</i>

499
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,231
Now get off with you.

500
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,792
<i>- I need it. I'll buy it from you.
- It's not for sale.</i>

501
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:07,158
<i>I'm good at faces.
I know you, don't I?</i>

502
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,194
I could have sworn that...

503
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,231
<i>That's not your wagon.</i>

504
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:18,713
Fat man, been here all week
from Bristol. He left this morning.

505
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,391
Be you thieves?

506
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,398
Take the lot.

507
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,794
<i>- Fair's fair, that's too much.
- Listen.</i>

508
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,391
<i>If you don't move, I'm gonna
have to split you from here...</i>

509
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,397
...to there.

510
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,479
John.

511
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,830
<i>It's madness going in there.</i>

512
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:53,198
<i>There's only one way in.
They'll bang the gate down on us.</i>

513
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,200
We could always come back tomorrow.

514
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,793
Oh, look!

515
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,151
Skillets! London-made!

516
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:20,830
What? Just pots and pans.

517
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:24,914
Pots and pans!
Pots and pans!

518
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,076
Pots and pans, Sisters?

519
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:32,396
<i>- There's a wagon beyond the gate.
- You're not supposed to be here.</i>

520
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:37,197
<i>- Can you see it?
- We can't buy pots, we're prisoners.</i>

521
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:41,678
<i>- God almighty! Do you see the wagon?
- You profaned God's name.</i>

522
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,436
- Who are you?
- Jesus Christ...

523
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:50,196
<i>A friend of Mother Jennet's,
and if we don't leave, we'll all die.</i>

524
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,631
Cut it, for chrissakes!

525
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,998
Move!

526
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,958
Up.

527
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:56,799
Where in hell are your crossbowmen?
Get them out here!

528
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,989
<i>This isn't much better.</i>

529
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,195
Those bloody nuns!

530
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,399
Hey!

531
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,630
After them!

532
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,119
God!

533
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,789
<i>- There's Robin Hood.
- Which one?</i>

534
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,268
Him!

535
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:53,397
<i>- Mother! There's barely time...
- Go on!</i>

536
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,039
Do as they ask!

537
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,548
- Robin!
- Jump!

538
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,190
<i>- I'll hurt myself.
- For chrissakes.</i>

539
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,311
<i>That's him.</i>

540
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,989
I should have taught you better.

541
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:26,995
<i>Two old men, for Jesus' sake,
two old men.</i>

542
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,517
<i>This one's still alive.
Take care of him.</i>

543
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,876
As for the rest of them...

544
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:40,278
...take up their limbs and bury them.

545
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,758
You there!

546
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,391
<i>- Raise it! Raise the gate!
- I can't, my lord. How?</i>

547
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,716
I ought to let you go.

548
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,518
<i>I'll bring him back.</i>

549
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:01,198
<i>Bring him back from Sherwood?
You won't even find him.</i>

550
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:04,039
- I can do it.
- In full armour, in the woods?

551
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,953
<i>You'll sink in the bogs.
I've tried it.</i>

552
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:10,869
<i>I've gone in after him.
I never even saw his archers.</i>

553
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,719
<i>Just the arrows in my
soldiers' bodies.</i>

554
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:20,716
<i>I can get him, and you failed.
And you don't like it.</i>

555
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,515
All right, get some men.

556
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,711
Raise the gates.

557
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,390
Here. Take this.
Give me your bow.

558
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,716
Get up there, keep watch.

559
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:56,919
Come on. Come on.

560
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,519
Come on!

561
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:05,711
<i>I can't keep doing this
kind of thing anymore.</i>

562
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,274
Turn left!

563
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,198
- Turn left!
- No, no.

564
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,917
She never did have the
touch for driving.

565
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,909
<i>Do you think they'll come after us?</i>

566
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:42,112
<i>We'll hear from Will if they do.</i>

567
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,750
<i>There's not another Mother
Abbess like you.</i>

568
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,030
<i>Amen to that. You're a marvel.</i>

569
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:54,593
Blood!

570
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,436
Oh! You fool.

571
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,315
<i>You've put on weight.</i>

572
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,198
<i>Was this a day! I haven't had one
like it since we left.</i>

573
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:29,552
Neither have I. Did we really
used to do this sort of thing?

574
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,313
All the time.

575
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,515
How did I bear it?

576
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:42,469
When I saw you on that wall,
I thought you were dead.

577
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,115
Why did I ever leave?

578
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:57,515
<i>Let's take a look at you.</i>

579
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:03,718
- Just a few bumps and bruises.
- All the same.

580
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,712
So many!

581
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:20,030
You had the sweetest body
when you left.

582
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:24,597
Hard, and not a mark.

583
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,710
And you were mine.

584
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,114
<i>When you left I thought I'd die.</i>

585
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,911
I even tried.

586
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,160
I walked out into the woods...

587
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,517
...and laid down by a stream
and cut myself.

588
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:47,431
Some damn fool forester came by,
took me to the abbey. So they say.

589
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:53,836
<i>No more scars, Robin.
It's too much to lose you twice.</i>

590
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,993
<i>I've never kissed
a member of the clergy.</i>

591
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,519
Would it be a sin?

592
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,310
<i>They're coming in!
Tuck, we'll need your bow.</i>

593
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:27,748
Right!

594
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,278
<i>- Hasn't there been enough?
- I'll meet you at camp.</i>

595
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:37,314
<i>- Don't go.
- I just want to see who's hunting me.</i>

596
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:35,112
Next time you ride into Sherwood,
keep your visor down.

597
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:38,518
John! Wait.

598
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:46,358
I hold my office from
the king himself.

599
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:48,437
I never liked your king.

600
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:51,832
<i>You're his subject and his servant.</i>

601
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:54,508
<i>He's not king here. Not in Sherwood.</i>

602
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:57,314
<i>You're the ruler? Should I bow?</i>

603
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:00,913
<i>I wouldn't have you in my service,
nobleman.</i>

604
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:03,350
<i>I've known your kind all my life.</i>

605
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:07,269
<i>You're everything I meant to fight.
You're the enemy.</i>

606
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:10,990
You gobble red meat
and we get bread and cheese.

607
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:15,910
<i>The laws can't touch you and there's
no crime you can be punished for.</i>

608
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:19,157
We can shoot a deer and have
our eyes put out.

609
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,518
This is my forest.

610
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,077
<i>I'll live here as I like.</i>

611
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:31,195
<i>You come in again and I'll kill you.</i>

612
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,034
Good.

613
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:48,476
- Was there fighting?
- Some.

614
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:51,478
You said you were only going to look.

615
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:56,959
My father worked honestly for years.
He left a pot, a blanket and a spoon.

616
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:58,957
The sheriff?

617
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,311
No, the oaf.

618
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:04,718
<i>- You didn't kill him?
- No.</i>

619
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:09,516
I told him this was my forest
and I want to live here with you.

620
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,111
What are you looking for?

621
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:37,915
Some trace of Marian.
Or Mother Jennet.

622
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,319
Either one.

623
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,633
Good woman, Jennet.

624
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:47,913
Years of diligence it took to leave
the flesh behind.

625
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:50,759
She could look at men
and feel nothing.

626
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:54,114
See? She looks at you.

627
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:59,116
Touch her hand. Hold it.

628
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:04,318
<i>Just as well.
She wouldn't feel anything.</i>

629
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:09,116
I think of what I did and it
makes no sense.

630
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:14,279
To want to die from wanting you!

631
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:17,313
Some other girl it must have been.

632
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:20,310
Let me hold you.

633
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:22,319
Robin...

634
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:30,719
Were there many women
on your great Crusade?

635
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:34,114
<i>- Lots.
- Don't tell me.</i>

636
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,314
- As you wish.
- How many?

637
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:44,509
But they all looked like you.

638
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:55,914
Am I old and ugly?

639
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:59,720
<i>Am I anything you'd want?</i>

640
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:09,712
<i>I've felt so little for so long.</i>

641
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:14,715
Robin...

642
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:17,713
Hurt me.

643
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:21,156
Make me cry.

644
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:10,594
<i>I can't stop smiling.</i>

645
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:12,717
<i>I don't mind.</i>

646
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:18,114
Could there be two rooms to our house
next time?

647
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:23,034
- And something for a floor?
- All right.

648
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:25,117
<i>I'd like that.</i>

649
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:28,714
And a bed with blankets?

650
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:32,709
And a chest for clothes, and...

651
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,318
Do you hear that?

652
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:54,474
<i>Jesus Christ almighty!
Don't...</i>

653
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:58,276
You do be Robin Hood, yes?

654
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,710
<i>I'll be damned!</i>

655
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:04,470
<i>I told them in the market it was you.
It's Robin.</i>

656
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,870
I told you so!

657
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:11,878
<i>Robin's back in Sherwood, I said.
I led them since I knew the way.</i>

658
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:15,432
<i>They're mostly from farms
round about here.</i>

659
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:20,510
<i>They're here to serve you
and fight against that king.</i>

660
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:23,997
Tuck! Give them all food.

661
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,711
So be it, then.

662
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:40,478
Go fight your sheriffs and your kings.

663
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:43,717
I love you and you make me proud.

664
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:50,716
<i>If there were a way to turn time back
just five minutes, I'd give my soul.</i>

665
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:29,913
- You ladies there, where is the king?
- In the largest tent, of course.

666
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:46,753
So you go to the pope
and you tell him...

667
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:52,916
<i>...if his archbishop puts one foot
in England, I'll cut his head off!</i>

668
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,712
<i>What's next?</i>

669
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:56,992
John...

670
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:02,953
<i>- Aren't you ever coming?
- Soon.</i>

671
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:06,510
I clean all over. Want to look?

672
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,110
The court is here.

673
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:13,513
<i>I don't mind.
I think you're pretty.</i>

674
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:25,310
<i>What in God's name do you want?</i>

675
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:29,235
- Men, Your Majesty. Two hundred men.
- Two...!

676
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:32,193
- What for?
- To fight an enemy.

677
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:35,870
- What enemy? There are so many.
- Robin Hood.

678
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:39,834
I thought the man was dead.

679
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:41,758
<i>He's back in Sherwood.</i>

680
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:45,790
<i>Can't the sheriff manage it?
Must I waste my time?</i>

681
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,515
My army waits for me in Dover.
Good God, man!

682
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:54,874
<i>These people have made a hero of him.
They're flocking to him.</i>

683
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,318
<i>He's become a legend.</i>

684
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:01,592
Have you tried to fight a legend?

685
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:06,149
- Just my brother.
- But, sire...

686
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,790
...they mean to rise against you.

687
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,718
Do they?

688
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:12,918
Do they?

689
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:17,510
<i>Be in Dover in the morning.
I'll give you men.</i>

690
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:23,830
<i>And you tell the sheriff I'll have
Robin's head, or I'll have his.</i>

691
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:28,118
<i>Either way, I'll win.</i>

692
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:11,471
Are you sure these berries
make it green?

693
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:15,150
Keep your bow arm straight
and pull it to your chin.

694
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,118
- Like that.
- Which arm?

695
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:21,199
All right, two!
Three!

696
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,279
The king was generous.

697
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,870
<i>He sends a message.
He wants Robin's head.</i>

698
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:03,439
Or mine.

699
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:08,511
- Follow me.
- These troops are my command.

700
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,709
Not in my county. Follow me!

701
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:17,917
This way!

702
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,514
- What, here?
- This is close enough.

703
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:58,120
- How many?
- Enough.

704
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:00,758
<i>And they're making camp.</i>

705
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:02,718
There in the field?

706
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:09,392
<i>- I'd thought they'd come in after us.
- They'll come.</i>

707
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:16,951
<i>- Will! Tuck!
- What's wrong?</i>

708
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:20,636
<i>The sheriff's here with an army.
A hundred soldiers.</i>

709
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:23,115
- Where are they?
- Near Kirkly.

710
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:27,911
<i>They'll be coming in at dawn.
I want us in position tonight.</i>

711
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:25,715
These pears are absolutely delicious.

712
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:33,310
<i>Damnedest thing.
He's still eating breakfast!</i>

713
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:34,714
Still?

714
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:38,069
<i>What's he waiting for? More men?</i>

715
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:41,115
<i>You'd think he had enough.</i>

716
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,158
What do we do?

717
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:45,551
We wait and see.

718
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:37,913
Come on.

719
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:54,156
No, thank you.

720
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:07,110
Come on, come along!

721
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:20,554
Now!

722
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:22,474
<i>Let's go!</i>

723
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,470
Call your men to sword!

724
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,916
<i>It's an attack, my lord.</i>

725
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:35,395
Call to arms, foot soldiers!

726
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:38,394
What happened?

727
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:40,431
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

728
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:43,114
We attacked. No one followed.

729
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:45,959
Are we to fight them in the open?

730
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,231
That seems to be the plan.

731
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:51,916
<i>We'd be slaughtered.
Does he think we're fools?</i>

732
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:54,674
<i>That's what he's waiting for.</i>

733
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,598
<i>He's the fool, then.</i>

734
01:16:56,920 --> 01:17:01,994
<i>He can sit out there forever.
He can't put a forest under siege.</i>

735
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:05,431
<i>That's how I see it.
He comes in, we've got him.</i>

736
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:07,636
<i>- We stay here.
- The man's mad.</i>

737
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,719
<i>You haven't asked what I think.</i>

738
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,115
<i>I think one madman's enough.</i>

739
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:18,476
<i>He's out there, Marian.
He expects me.</i>

740
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:19,954
Let him.

741
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,518
The mist is rising.

742
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,190
You look so cold.

743
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:49,229
<i>It's so beautiful, this place.</i>

744
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:52,552
The woods just now. Full of noises...

745
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,711
...everything so alive.

746
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:56,958
I kept thinking...

747
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:59,236
<i>...of all the death I've seen.</i>

748
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:04,313
<i>I've hardly lost a battle,
and I don't know what I've won.</i>

749
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:10,228
<i>"The day is ours, Robin. "
And then it was tomorrow.</i>

750
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:12,158
But where did the day go?

751
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:18,798
<i>You're so beautiful.</i>

752
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,072
Come and sit by me.

753
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:30,396
Do you love me?

754
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:33,634
Say it.

755
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,752
<i>What's the matter?</i>

756
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:39,634
Nothing.

757
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:41,919
Nothing.

758
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:51,109
<i>- You're going, aren't you?
- It's a possibility.</i>

759
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:56,752
You heard John, and Will and Tuck.
They said it was madness.

760
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:58,559
Well...

761
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:03,992
<i>Is that all being dead means?
"Well... "</i>

762
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:06,998
<i>I'll have more to say when the
time comes.</i>

763
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:10,431
<i>Let it be God's time.
He'll take you soon enough.</i>

764
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:13,074
<i>Then it's all in his hands.</i>

765
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:18,116
<i>You think I'm gray and old.
Well, I'm not.</i>

766
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:24,232
<i>Oh, Robin, I'd be 20 for you
if I could.</i>

767
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,352
<i>I'm all I ever was.</i>

768
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:31,915
You saw me on the wall.

769
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:35,233
Yes.

770
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:43,032
<i>And if you come back there'll be
another morning, won't there?</i>

771
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:48,998
<i>And each time you'll be less.
Not Robin anymore.</i>

772
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,395
<i>- And then one day...
- You'll see.</i>

773
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:55,995
<i>No, I won't see.</i>

774
01:19:56,280 --> 01:20:00,831
<i>Or hear the songs about bold Robin.
I'll be gone.</i>

775
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:05,273
Leave? Why?

776
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,709
<i>Because I'll do everything for you
but mourn.</i>

777
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:14,913
Go fight your sheriff,
and may God go with you.

778
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:18,710
May the sun shine
and the day be great.

779
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:23,514
But, Robin...

780
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:26,714
...I never want to know.

781
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:34,834
John.

782
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:40,790
<i>I'll do anything you say.
I'll leave here.</i>

783
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:45,832
<i>I'll go as if he never found me.
Only stop him from this thing.</i>

784
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:49,635
- What thing?
- His march against the sheriff.

785
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,914
<i>- What?
- Didn't he tell you?</i>

786
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:59,112
<i>Fight the sheriff? Don't be mad.
It's four to one. We'd be slaughtered.</i>

787
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:04,270
<i>These are boys we've got.
They're farmers.</i>

788
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:07,392
<i>Tell him! You're the only one.
He'll listen.</i>

789
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:10,797
Me? Say no to Rob?

790
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:13,310
Just this once.

791
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:16,719
<i>We've always been together.</i>

792
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:19,715
<i>I'd be nothing without him.</i>

793
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:23,078
<i>I want him safe, that's all.
I'll leave.</i>

794
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,874
What more do you want from me?

795
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,719
<i>I haven't asked for anything.</i>

796
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:32,514
You never liked me much.

797
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:39,596
<i>- You're Rob's lady.
- Go on, say it.</i>

798
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:43,515
<i>You're Rob's lady.</i>

799
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:45,315
Lf...

800
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:50,315
<i>...you'd been mine,
I never would have left you.</i>

801
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:03,951
Oh, damn you.

802
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:11,917
<i>You've had him with you. You've had
years! And I'm going to lose him.</i>

803
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:14,868
<i>- No, you won't.
- Oh, John!</i>

804
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:19,317
Oh, John...

805
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,431
John.

806
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:25,115
<i>I'll watch over him.</i>

807
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:27,112
<i>Don't cry.</i>

808
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,311
<i>He'll be back.</i>

809
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:38,718
<i>We're going out.</i>

810
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:40,308
Yes, I know.

811
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:42,033
She told you?

812
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:43,389
Yes.

813
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:44,953
Well?

814
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:47,710
She asked me not to go.

815
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:49,997
And you decided what?

816
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:53,312
<i>It's mad, Rob.</i>

817
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:55,113
And?

818
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:56,913
Well...

819
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:01,116
<i>I told her you'd be lost without me.</i>

820
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:06,879
This may be the hardest part
of the day.

821
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:08,911
I doubt it.

822
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:32,589
- Goodbye.
- What?

823
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:36,557
God keep you well.

824
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:40,311
If he so chooses.

825
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:25,718
Move!

826
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:29,555
All right, you men, put
it here. And hold it!

827
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:35,518
Sit still!

828
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:51,709
Await your orders.

829
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,911
<i>I knew you'd come.</i>

830
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:05,028
Of all men, just for you.

831
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:06,674
I know.

832
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:11,311
- I want to settle this with champions.
- One of yours against mine?

833
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:13,471
The winner takes the day.

834
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:15,358
Why should I, Robin?

835
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:19,309
The odds are four to one.
Why should I make them even?

836
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:21,868
<i>I'm one champion.</i>

837
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:25,437
<i>And I'm the other?</i>

838
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:29,109
If I lose, my men are yours.

839
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:33,953
<i>- Without me, they won't trouble you.
- And if I lose?</i>

840
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:38,118
Your soldiers leave the field.

841
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:42,588
Those are my orders.
Are they clear?

842
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:45,713
I let this rabble go?
Just march away?

843
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:48,557
Those are my orders.

844
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:50,273
Leave the field!

845
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:04,510
<i>I promised I'd watch out for you.
I promised her.</i>

846
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:07,359
<i>She's gone, in any case.</i>

847
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:10,319
<i>- I'll kill him, Rob, if you don't.
- No!</i>

848
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:13,520
What you do is keep my word.

849
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:18,997
<i>I'll see you, Johnny.</i>

850
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:21,519
Off you go.

851
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,916
God be with us, Robin.

852
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:39,678
Come on.

853
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:04,474
Whoa!

854
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:40,473
Will you not yield?

855
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:42,312
No!

856
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:45,318
<i>I'm tired.</i>

857
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:51,113
Marian!

858
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:55,111
<i>I couldn't stop him.</i>

859
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:16,553
For the love of God, Robin!

860
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:39,714
All right?

861
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:44,832
<i>We've got to get the
men into the woods.</i>

862
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:13,192
<i>You're a stout lad.</i>

863
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:16,472
<i>- What's your name?
- They call me Little John.</i>

864
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:18,154
Well met.

865
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:20,516
<i>Let's see how tall you are.</i>

866
01:33:23,480 --> 01:33:24,708
Robin!

867
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:28,158
- Look at you.
- You came back.

868
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:29,679
Can you hold him?

869
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:33,429
<i>We'll take him to the abbey.
My medicines are there.</i>

870
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:06,633
<i>I thought I'd seen the last of you.
A woman of your word.</i>

871
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:09,914
<i>I'm glad you came back.</i>

872
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:27,318
Up there.

873
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:37,511
Stand still!

874
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,514
I wonder where the day went?

875
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:01,116
Vespers it must be.

876
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:06,112
What kind of abbey is this?
No one rings the hours.

877
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:08,511
Are you in great pain?

878
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:11,233
A little weary.

879
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:13,311
<i>I've had worse.</i>

880
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:21,914
He went down well, the sheriff did.
Brave man.

881
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:24,429
And the better one today.

882
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:28,519
The years...
The years, they whittle at you.

883
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:32,510
I should give it up, you know.

884
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:36,315
<i>I doubt I'll have a day
like this again. And yet...</i>

885
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:39,519
John!

886
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:45,708
<i>- Lf they should follow us...
- I'll wait outside.</i>

887
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:48,593
- I did my best.
- I know.

888
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:09,876
This will help the pain.

889
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:17,469
<i>He's something, John is.</i>

890
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:19,750
<i>No one's gentler in the world...</i>

891
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,718
...nor half as terrible.

892
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:23,911
Did you see him?

893
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:36,388
I should go and tend my men.

894
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:38,511
Brave boys, all of them.

895
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:40,517
I meant to...

896
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:44,110
I like your medicine.

897
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:46,920
<i>There's no pain at all.</i>

898
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,594
<i>We'll have a time in the forest.</i>

899
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:02,628
<i>You'll tend me till I'm well again.
And then...</i>

900
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:04,711
...great battles!

901
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:07,798
<i>We'll have a life to sing about.</i>

902
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:15,799
My...

903
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:18,191
...legs are cold.

904
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:20,599
I know.

905
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:23,713
<i>They're numb.</i>

906
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:27,834
I... I said you would have no pain.

907
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:31,517
What have you done?

908
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:38,713
John!

909
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:40,759
<i>I'm poisoned!</i>

910
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:43,315
Help me!

911
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:45,830
No one can help you now.

912
01:37:47,680 --> 01:37:49,716
Jesus, Marian!

913
01:37:58,480 --> 01:37:59,708
Why?

914
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:06,116
I love you.

915
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:11,033
More than all you know.

916
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:15,314
I love you more than children.

917
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:23,116
<i>More than fields I've
planted with my hands.</i>

918
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:30,711
I love you more than morning
prayers or peace or...

919
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:34,710
...or food to eat.

920
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:39,157
I love you more than sunlight...

921
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:42,917
...more than flesh or joy...

922
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:45,909
...or one more day.

923
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:52,918
I love you...

924
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:56,238
...more than God.

925
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:03,195
<i>I'd never have a day like
this again, would I?</i>

926
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:11,516
<i>Well, it's better this way.</i>

927
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:19,954
Marian.

928
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:33,717
<i>It's all right.</i>

929
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:36,594
Rob.

930
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:40,599
Look at you.

931
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:42,911
<i>It's all right.</i>

932
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:45,553
<i>It's all right.</i>

933
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:49,952
No.

934
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:52,628
No.

935
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,116
Give me my bow.

936
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:15,914
Where this falls, John...

937
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:18,834
...put us close...

938
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:21,355
...and leave us there.
