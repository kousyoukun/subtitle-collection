1
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,534
Now!

2
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,278
See anything?

3
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:49,947
You think it's deserted?

4
00:02:55,427 --> 00:02:58,885
If they've gone off with the treasure,
Richard won't be pleased.

5
00:02:59,332 --> 00:03:01,266
If there ever was a treasure.

6
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:06,334
One more flight.

7
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,845
- John.
- Cease firing!

8
00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:24,059
I speak for Richard Lionheart...

9
00:03:24,127 --> 00:03:26,857
...King of England, lord of half of France...

10
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,694
...and thereby overlord of this domain.

11
00:03:30,534 --> 00:03:32,627
I'm up here speaking for myself.

12
00:03:32,803 --> 00:03:34,930
- Where are your soldiers?
- Ran off.

13
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,632
- Where is the Lord of Châlus?
- He led them.

14
00:03:38,977 --> 00:03:41,138
Ask if he knows about the treasure.

15
00:03:41,547 --> 00:03:44,948
Left me with all the women and children,
and no weapons anyplace.

16
00:03:45,518 --> 00:03:48,453
Here am I with only half an eye,
collecting arrows.

17
00:03:48,688 --> 00:03:51,418
And you think I've got a bow
to shoot them with.

18
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:00,699
My king thinks your lord
is keeping treasure from him.

19
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:03,601
It's my orders to get it.

20
00:04:05,808 --> 00:04:09,005
That'll be the treasure people say
was found by Jean the ploughman.

21
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:13,140
- Great gold statue, 3 foot long.
- That's the one.

22
00:04:13,249 --> 00:04:17,447
I was with him when they found it.
What we dug up was a rock.

23
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:20,318
Now we're fighting for a rock.

24
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:23,985
You want to look?
Out there in the turnip field.

25
00:04:24,429 --> 00:04:26,761
We couldn't lift it, so we left it.

26
00:04:27,165 --> 00:04:28,655
What I've come to say is...

27
00:04:28,733 --> 00:04:32,499
...if there's to be a fight,
I'm all there is. Come and get me.

28
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:35,831
You're a mad old man.

29
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:40,074
What now?

30
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:43,913
I want to give that rock to Richard.
Let's find the turnip field.

31
00:04:46,855 --> 00:04:47,981
John.

32
00:05:12,818 --> 00:05:14,581
What kind of siege is this?

33
00:05:14,853 --> 00:05:17,947
- Where's Lord Châlus and my treasure?
- Gone.

34
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,487
My treasure? Gone?

35
00:05:20,894 --> 00:05:23,692
The lord is gone. Your treasure never was.

36
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:27,695
A gold statue, 3 foot long. I want it.

37
00:05:30,671 --> 00:05:32,832
- Captain.
- Yes, my lord.

38
00:05:33,274 --> 00:05:35,799
I ordered you to take this castle.

39
00:05:35,977 --> 00:05:38,605
- Yes, my lord.
- Well, take it.

40
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,849
Bring it down and get my statue.

41
00:05:42,285 --> 00:05:45,584
They surrender, and your statue is a rock.

42
00:05:46,122 --> 00:05:47,749
I want it done.

43
00:05:48,392 --> 00:05:50,292
- There is no treasure.
- Do it.

44
00:05:51,228 --> 00:05:54,959
There are no soldiers,
just some children and a mad old man.

45
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:57,325
And what's that to me?

46
00:05:57,535 --> 00:05:59,526
Well, it should mean something.

47
00:06:00,405 --> 00:06:04,273
Is that disapproval, Robin?
Am I in the wrong?

48
00:06:04,743 --> 00:06:06,472
I followed you 20 years.

49
00:06:06,645 --> 00:06:09,409
I fought for you on the Crusades,
and here in France.

50
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,744
Show me a soldier and I'll fight him now...

51
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:15,251
...but I won't slaughter children
for a piece of gold that never was.

52
00:06:15,755 --> 00:06:17,222
I ordered it.

53
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:22,924
I command you.

54
00:06:23,264 --> 00:06:26,563
You do it! You're a bastard, you'll enjoy it.

55
00:06:27,002 --> 00:06:30,130
Damn right I'll do it! Mercadier!

56
00:06:30,873 --> 00:06:34,673
Arrest those two! Lock them up.
I'll have their heads on pikes.

57
00:06:34,744 --> 00:06:38,407
I want these walls down.
I want every damned head in that place!

58
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:40,239
Lionheart.

59
00:06:41,518 --> 00:06:42,849
Lionheart!

60
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,015
You are a pig!

61
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,120
Good God!

62
00:07:19,528 --> 00:07:20,790
Well...

63
00:07:22,032 --> 00:07:23,863
...so it was a stone.

64
00:07:36,882 --> 00:07:40,215
- Is this a barber-surgeon?
- Yes, my lord.

65
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,379
I only look after your men, sir.

66
00:07:43,456 --> 00:07:45,083
- With much success?
- Yes.

67
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:48,525
- You've seen to John and Robin?
- Under guard, on their way to Châlus.

68
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:50,790
Come on, come on.

69
00:07:51,732 --> 00:07:54,326
The patient's cold, and the doctor sweats.

70
00:07:57,072 --> 00:07:58,767
The arrow will be hard to reach.

71
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,638
That should make it
all the more worthwhile.

72
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,473
Well, you heard it, Mercadier.

73
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:11,511
I told him to attack, he told me no.
I ought to kill him for it.

74
00:08:12,122 --> 00:08:16,491
- Will you?
- I don't know. It depends on my mood.

75
00:08:16,727 --> 00:08:20,322
I killed them all this afternoon
except the old man. I let him go.

76
00:08:20,398 --> 00:08:21,831
I liked his eye.

77
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,990
But, Robin...

78
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:26,971
We've been friends, you see, for 20 years.

79
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:30,471
I met him in Nottingham for the first time.

80
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,737
I needed men for the Crusade.
Robin was the best that ever came to me.

81
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:39,308
Well, get on with it.
I'll die of old age at this rate.

82
00:08:40,588 --> 00:08:43,182
So off we went to do great things.

83
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:48,188
We led 300,000 men to the Holy Land,
and came back on a boat with 50.

84
00:08:49,231 --> 00:08:52,200
Not at all what we intended.

85
00:08:53,803 --> 00:08:55,464
Christ!

86
00:08:56,439 --> 00:09:00,705
I do what has to be done. I have no choice.

87
00:09:01,845 --> 00:09:05,645
But Robin judges me. He always does.

88
00:09:05,749 --> 00:09:07,478
The peasant bastard!

89
00:09:07,652 --> 00:09:09,483
Judge a king!

90
00:09:12,457 --> 00:09:13,947
Butcher.

91
00:09:16,128 --> 00:09:19,325
I'll show you how it's done.

92
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,242
King's blood.

93
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,952
Remember it.

94
00:09:43,827 --> 00:09:45,351
It's cold.

95
00:09:45,962 --> 00:09:47,725
I don't like the dark.

96
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:51,459
Mercadier, how long to Châlus?
Half a league?

97
00:09:51,735 --> 00:09:52,793
Sire.

98
00:09:53,204 --> 00:09:57,368
A little rest and then I'll attend
to John and Robin.

99
00:10:06,953 --> 00:10:10,411
What would you have done?
Killed the old man, women and children?

100
00:10:10,991 --> 00:10:13,983
You didn't save them.
They're all dead and we're in here.

101
00:10:14,061 --> 00:10:16,495
- I didn't force you to come.
- You looked at me.

102
00:10:16,563 --> 00:10:17,791
You nodded.

103
00:10:18,766 --> 00:10:20,495
What do you want me to do?

104
00:10:26,141 --> 00:10:27,608
I don't know.

105
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:32,106
What did I get us into?

106
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:36,407
I could have talked to Richard.
I could have tried.

107
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,888
Well, he is a bloody bastard.

108
00:10:40,324 --> 00:10:42,485
Are we any better? We serve him.

109
00:10:46,398 --> 00:10:47,831
He's our king.

110
00:10:47,966 --> 00:10:49,900
I took him for a great king.

111
00:10:50,035 --> 00:10:53,994
There we were in Sherwood,
robbing abbots, giving pennies to the poor.

112
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,500
It didn't seem much
compared to rescuing the Holy Land.

113
00:10:59,345 --> 00:11:00,972
How can you eat?

114
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,508
I'm hungry.

115
00:11:09,591 --> 00:11:12,185
They reckon it's a good life
to have reached 40.

116
00:11:13,194 --> 00:11:15,424
We've both passed it, and look at us!

117
00:11:16,832 --> 00:11:19,300
My poor old dad,
and all the dads before him...

118
00:11:19,368 --> 00:11:21,165
...lived in Barnesdale.

119
00:11:22,439 --> 00:11:24,737
All they ever knew was one small town.

120
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,076
I've known a king...

121
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:30,838
...traveled half the world, seen Jerusalem.

122
00:11:30,915 --> 00:11:34,373
The sand was blowing
and the walls were miles away, but...

123
00:11:36,322 --> 00:11:38,222
I think I've had a good life.

124
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:44,121
Do you think Richard will kill us?

125
00:11:45,665 --> 00:11:47,758
I don't know him anymore.

126
00:11:48,134 --> 00:11:49,931
I don't know the man.

127
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:55,598
Well, if we go, we go.

128
00:11:57,646 --> 00:11:59,614
Is that your idea of dying?

129
00:12:01,116 --> 00:12:02,640
I don't know.

130
00:12:02,918 --> 00:12:05,546
You'd think I'd learn.
I've seen enough of it.

131
00:12:09,092 --> 00:12:12,220
I'll tell you something. I won't go quietly.

132
00:12:19,404 --> 00:12:20,803
Come here.

133
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:25,442
Bend down.

134
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:44,694
If I had not met you,
think what I'd have missed.

135
00:13:09,094 --> 00:13:11,790
The King will see you now. Come on.

136
00:13:59,418 --> 00:14:00,908
Your Majesty.

137
00:14:08,661 --> 00:14:11,755
We are celebrating our demise.

138
00:14:11,965 --> 00:14:14,525
I always fancied leaving
from a rather larger stage.

139
00:14:14,602 --> 00:14:17,264
But my physician, a funny fellow...

140
00:14:17,338 --> 00:14:20,398
I've already had him hanged.
It seemed a fair exchange.

141
00:14:21,042 --> 00:14:23,602
Wine! A bucket of it.

142
00:14:24,312 --> 00:14:28,544
But you're not for hanging.
You're for cutting up.

143
00:14:28,718 --> 00:14:31,084
I would've done it already but for this.

144
00:14:31,854 --> 00:14:34,015
- Will that be all, my lord?
- All?

145
00:14:34,758 --> 00:14:36,817
Damn your "all"!

146
00:14:37,928 --> 00:14:39,395
All done.

147
00:14:39,696 --> 00:14:41,857
All over.

148
00:14:43,268 --> 00:14:46,999
My father cursed me when he died.

149
00:14:48,274 --> 00:14:51,710
I killed him, and he felt resentful.
He'd have loved all this.

150
00:14:54,013 --> 00:14:55,640
I said a bucket.

151
00:14:56,449 --> 00:14:57,939
A bucket!

152
00:15:00,921 --> 00:15:02,684
John's the next king.

153
00:15:03,191 --> 00:15:04,886
You remember John.

154
00:15:05,393 --> 00:15:08,851
John Lackland they called him.
Now he gets all the land.

155
00:15:09,398 --> 00:15:11,696
Christ, why did I have no children?

156
00:15:12,601 --> 00:15:15,968
Never gave a damn about England.
Never really there.

157
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,368
Not even as a corpse!

158
00:15:22,445 --> 00:15:26,438
They're planting me in France,
by my father!

159
00:15:28,152 --> 00:15:29,744
Take something, Robin.

160
00:15:31,523 --> 00:15:33,013
Nothing, sire.

161
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:36,724
He sulks.

162
00:15:36,928 --> 00:15:41,831
He pouts. He gives his life to Richard,
and he's sorry.

163
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,303
You don't know what sorrow is.

164
00:15:45,072 --> 00:15:47,404
I was a king.

165
00:15:48,442 --> 00:15:49,773
My mother...

166
00:15:50,611 --> 00:15:52,875
She'll be 80 soon, the bitch.

167
00:15:53,281 --> 00:15:55,806
I've sent for her. Do you think she'll come?

168
00:15:59,421 --> 00:16:00,718
Bucket.

169
00:16:05,795 --> 00:16:08,229
Clever fellow, death is.

170
00:16:11,902 --> 00:16:16,339
I've tried to find him on my terms.
God knows I've tried.

171
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:22,812
Ask for something, damn you!

172
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,485
It's too late. There's nothing left.

173
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,422
There's still your life.

174
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,421
You take me as an equal. You always did.

175
00:16:38,632 --> 00:16:42,398
I'll carve you yet, you peasant bastard.

176
00:16:42,804 --> 00:16:44,237
Mercadier!

177
00:16:44,706 --> 00:16:46,173
My sword!

178
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:51,645
While I'm still King of England, I'll...

179
00:16:52,148 --> 00:16:53,410
Richard!

180
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,686
Richard, it's me.

181
00:17:03,828 --> 00:17:05,420
I know it's you.

182
00:17:05,863 --> 00:17:07,956
You couldn't leave me, could you?

183
00:17:08,866 --> 00:17:10,424
You're free of me.

184
00:17:10,903 --> 00:17:12,734
I'll let you go.

185
00:17:13,272 --> 00:17:16,002
What will you do without me now,
jolly Robin...

186
00:17:17,177 --> 00:17:18,769
...now I'm dead?

187
00:18:07,267 --> 00:18:08,996
That's that.

188
00:18:15,343 --> 00:18:16,708
What now?

189
00:18:18,346 --> 00:18:20,644
We watched him die. He saw us there.

190
00:18:21,617 --> 00:18:23,881
He won't mind if we miss the funeral.

191
00:18:26,288 --> 00:18:28,882
Where do we go? Which way?

192
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:30,754
North.

193
00:18:31,628 --> 00:18:33,220
Why north?

194
00:18:33,496 --> 00:18:35,396
England's there.

195
00:18:35,499 --> 00:18:37,694
Let's go home, John.

196
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,613
There she is!

197
00:19:51,685 --> 00:19:54,153
I'll race you. Come on!

198
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:27,391
- You sure?
- Of course I'm sure.

199
00:20:28,962 --> 00:20:30,429
This way.

200
00:21:04,936 --> 00:21:09,635
- A lot of thorns can grow in 20 years.
- I know these woods.

201
00:21:10,642 --> 00:21:12,940
Good place to pass the night.

202
00:21:13,412 --> 00:21:15,403
We're going through.

203
00:21:21,188 --> 00:21:22,348
What's that?

204
00:21:23,457 --> 00:21:25,322
- Deer.
- Deer?

205
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:33,459
Someone's seen us. Come on.

206
00:21:51,255 --> 00:21:52,552
I can see it!

207
00:21:52,623 --> 00:21:55,490
- I can't even see you.
- That's the top of my tree.

208
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:02,590
I told you this was the way.

209
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:08,200
There's nothing left.

210
00:22:08,742 --> 00:22:10,573
What did you expect to find?

211
00:22:11,912 --> 00:22:14,437
I don't know. I never thought...

212
00:22:24,126 --> 00:22:25,616
John!

213
00:22:36,307 --> 00:22:38,036
Quick, Robin. There!

214
00:22:46,552 --> 00:22:48,247
All right, boy.

215
00:22:56,062 --> 00:22:58,656
Jesus, Rob, mine's an old man!

216
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,301
Robin?

217
00:23:04,138 --> 00:23:07,301
It's me, Tuck. Tuck and Will!

218
00:23:08,744 --> 00:23:10,473
Will? Will!

219
00:23:11,446 --> 00:23:13,812
Robin! You've come home!

220
00:23:17,453 --> 00:23:21,184
"And evil Prince John
Took one look at his sword

221
00:23:21,325 --> 00:23:25,193
"And fled to his castle
And prayed to the Lord

222
00:23:25,629 --> 00:23:28,894
"Follow him, follow him
Bloody and brave

223
00:23:28,967 --> 00:23:32,994
"I'll follow bold Robin
From here to the grave"

224
00:23:34,573 --> 00:23:36,803
They've turned us into heroes.

225
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:38,907
You didn't make it up?

226
00:23:38,978 --> 00:23:42,379
I don't know where these songs
come from. They're everywhere.

227
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:46,181
- We go from town to town.
- What do you do for a living?

228
00:23:47,121 --> 00:23:49,146
While I take confessions...

229
00:23:49,323 --> 00:23:50,950
...he takes the horses.

230
00:23:52,193 --> 00:23:56,061
Everywhere we go,
they want to hear about the things you did.

231
00:23:56,298 --> 00:23:57,697
We didn't do them.

232
00:23:57,933 --> 00:23:59,924
I know that.

233
00:24:01,905 --> 00:24:05,432
I think I'll go to Barnesdale in the morning.
See my dad.

234
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,701
He died, John. Years ago.

235
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:18,145
Wouldn't have known me anyway.

236
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:20,315
What happened here after we went off?

237
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:23,088
Did Marian... Is she still alive?

238
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:28,093
Last time we passed Nottingham.
She lives down Kirkly way. Not far.

239
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:31,668
Lovely girl.
Haven't thought of her in years.

240
00:24:32,873 --> 00:24:34,238
And the sheriff?

241
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:37,635
He still rules the county,
he's as powerful as ever.

242
00:24:38,146 --> 00:24:40,341
Those were good days, fighting him.

243
00:24:41,182 --> 00:24:43,013
What about the rest of us?

244
00:24:43,284 --> 00:24:45,149
They died or went away.

245
00:24:45,454 --> 00:24:49,015
When the Crusades ended, we were sure
you'd come. When you didn't...

246
00:24:49,091 --> 00:24:51,082
...we took you to be dead.

247
00:24:51,161 --> 00:24:52,788
Like Richard.

248
00:24:53,363 --> 00:24:54,955
Aye, Richard, well...

249
00:24:55,065 --> 00:24:57,260
I mean, King John must be mad.

250
00:24:57,501 --> 00:25:01,665
His own kind have turned against him.
The kingdom is falling apart.

251
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:06,970
His queen is 12 years old,
and all he does is stay in bed with her.

252
00:25:09,982 --> 00:25:12,382
And you know he's fighting with the Pope.

253
00:25:12,752 --> 00:25:17,018
You can't hear Mass or take
Holy Communion anywhere in England.

254
00:25:18,525 --> 00:25:21,085
If ever there was a time for us, it is now.

255
00:25:21,428 --> 00:25:24,625
The people would come to you
if you called them.

256
00:25:26,267 --> 00:25:27,700
Fight the King?

257
00:25:28,803 --> 00:25:30,668
Then why did you come back?

258
00:25:31,106 --> 00:25:32,801
Not to fight.

259
00:25:33,475 --> 00:25:36,410
Sing us another song, Will.
One that really happened.

260
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:38,736
About Marian.

261
00:25:39,448 --> 00:25:42,884
About Marian? Oh, aye.
Marian, now let's see...

262
00:25:48,593 --> 00:25:51,289
Still, it would be something,
wouldn't it, Rob?

263
00:25:53,498 --> 00:25:55,227
Not at my age.

264
00:26:01,473 --> 00:26:02,770
No!

265
00:26:12,687 --> 00:26:17,181
All right, come on, you.
You, too. Hack the post.

266
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:25,164
My arms are getting tired.

267
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:31,769
Dolt, get up!

268
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,673
They never learn.

269
00:26:44,522 --> 00:26:48,219
No. Put your body weight behind it.

270
00:26:53,834 --> 00:26:55,529
All right!

271
00:26:59,507 --> 00:27:01,372
I'll take two men at once.

272
00:27:01,843 --> 00:27:03,777
The rest of you, pay attention.

273
00:27:04,312 --> 00:27:05,574
You...

274
00:27:06,615 --> 00:27:08,310
...and you.

275
00:27:36,315 --> 00:27:37,782
Any questions?

276
00:27:40,753 --> 00:27:43,244
Take that rope over there...

277
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,021
My Lord Sheriff!

278
00:27:49,631 --> 00:27:51,098
Yes, my lord.

279
00:27:51,533 --> 00:27:53,091
It's time to go.

280
00:27:53,768 --> 00:27:55,292
Sir Ranulf.

281
00:27:58,307 --> 00:28:02,869
In my domain, never tell me, always ask.

282
00:28:15,526 --> 00:28:18,757
Taxes, what you got?
Tom the ploughman, one egg. Put it down.

283
00:28:19,598 --> 00:28:21,088
What else? Your tax?

284
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,964
- One chicken, Sam the herdsman.
- Slow down a bit.

285
00:28:28,575 --> 00:28:30,805
She won't be able to pay...

286
00:28:31,645 --> 00:28:35,342
If you want to work with me,
you must pay your taxes like anybody else.

287
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:39,882
Hey! He's taken my egg.

288
00:28:40,088 --> 00:28:42,454
He can't do that. What am I going to do?

289
00:28:46,062 --> 00:28:49,998
Now what will I do? Where do you think
I'll get another egg from?

290
00:28:53,003 --> 00:28:54,368
Watch it.

291
00:28:57,474 --> 00:29:01,240
- Aren't we going to Nottingham?
- I thought we'd go by Kirkly first.

292
00:29:04,816 --> 00:29:08,445
- Kirkly's this way.
- Aye, but Marian's up there.

293
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:10,418
- Up there?
- Well, aye.

294
00:29:10,656 --> 00:29:13,648
- That's Kirkly Abbey.
- Aye, so it is.

295
00:29:14,361 --> 00:29:16,090
What's she doing up there?

296
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:19,193
She's lived there for 18 years or more.

297
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:21,993
A nun! She can't be! Not my Marian.

298
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:24,032
You'll see.

299
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:29,942
- I won't know what to say to her.
- She'll think of something.

300
00:29:48,566 --> 00:29:50,727
This will help the pain.

301
00:29:52,037 --> 00:29:53,800
Hello, the abbey!

302
00:29:54,339 --> 00:29:55,863
Damn!

303
00:29:56,609 --> 00:29:59,669
Forgive me. It's the sheriff.
I have a busy day.

304
00:30:09,156 --> 00:30:10,418
Hello?

305
00:30:11,926 --> 00:30:13,450
John, you go in.

306
00:30:13,528 --> 00:30:15,928
I never said goodbye, she might be angry.

307
00:30:17,498 --> 00:30:19,830
Better yet, leave it for another day.

308
00:30:21,704 --> 00:30:23,228
You, there!

309
00:30:23,606 --> 00:30:25,801
What in hell do you want?

310
00:30:26,042 --> 00:30:27,805
This is Kirkly Abbey?

311
00:30:28,044 --> 00:30:30,342
Yes, and I'm the abbess. Who are you?

312
00:30:32,483 --> 00:30:34,075
Good God, it's Marian.

313
00:30:37,488 --> 00:30:38,785
Robin.

314
00:30:40,492 --> 00:30:43,484
- What are you doing in that costume?
- Living in it.

315
00:30:48,468 --> 00:30:50,902
Well, I've come home to you, Marian.

316
00:30:51,671 --> 00:30:54,765
The wars are over. I'm here.

317
00:30:55,109 --> 00:30:58,476
It's Mother Jennet now.
You can trot right back to Jerusalem.

318
00:30:59,647 --> 00:31:00,841
You're angry.

319
00:31:01,416 --> 00:31:03,884
I haven't thought of you in 20 years.

320
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:07,287
Give me a smile. Invite me in.

321
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:09,954
Come back tomorrow. I'll be gone.

322
00:31:10,026 --> 00:31:13,518
- The sheriff's coming. I'm off to prison.
- Off to prison?

323
00:31:15,032 --> 00:31:17,159
Marian! What did you say?

324
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:19,465
Damn the man!

325
00:31:27,612 --> 00:31:30,240
- Mother Jennet...
- They'll be here for me soon.

326
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:34,444
- You're in no danger, carry on.
- But...

327
00:31:34,586 --> 00:31:38,886
No services, but you must help
all those who come as best you can.

328
00:31:39,459 --> 00:31:41,017
Marian.

329
00:31:42,696 --> 00:31:45,688
- What happened? Explain.
- I haven't time.

330
00:31:46,067 --> 00:31:50,060
- But why the sheriff? What did you do?
- God's work. That's what I do.

331
00:32:01,417 --> 00:32:05,217
- lf you're in trouble, I can save you.
- I have nothing to be saved from.

332
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:07,416
- I don't want you.
- You've got me.

333
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:10,953
- I like the way you look.
- More than I can say for you.

334
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:18,063
So this is your room.
And I thought I knew you.

335
00:32:18,404 --> 00:32:20,338
What's happened to you?

336
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:23,165
Good things.

337
00:32:23,342 --> 00:32:28,075
I work hard. I've studied herbs and
medicines, I till the fields. I love my life.

338
00:32:28,148 --> 00:32:30,173
I won't give it up.
When the sheriff comes...

339
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,808
What's he coming for?

340
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:33,484
I'm the abbess.

341
00:32:33,621 --> 00:32:38,081
The King's ordered the higher clergy
out of England. I'm not going.

342
00:32:38,426 --> 00:32:40,986
When he comes,
he'll find me doing what I do.

343
00:32:42,331 --> 00:32:45,528
- You mean to let him take you?
- God's with me.

344
00:32:46,235 --> 00:32:49,932
- He didn't help us on the Crusades.
- Rob! Horsemen!

345
00:32:51,274 --> 00:32:53,640
- Wait there.
- But it's my life, Robin.

346
00:32:53,778 --> 00:32:55,405
You're a fool.

347
00:32:57,848 --> 00:32:59,713
How many are they?

348
00:33:00,886 --> 00:33:03,411
- Six!
- I like the odds.

349
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:19,001
My Lord Sheriff.

350
00:33:20,107 --> 00:33:21,768
Robin.

351
00:33:23,511 --> 00:33:25,138
Still not dead?

352
00:33:25,647 --> 00:33:27,512
Not for want of trying.

353
00:33:28,016 --> 00:33:30,814
You look well, all things considered.

354
00:33:34,256 --> 00:33:37,487
- How was the Crusade?
- A disappointment.

355
00:33:38,361 --> 00:33:40,852
After all these years, look at us.

356
00:33:41,898 --> 00:33:45,390
I'm nothing but a former captain.
You're still the sheriff.

357
00:33:45,837 --> 00:33:47,395
No advancement.

358
00:33:48,239 --> 00:33:50,969
I can read and write.
It makes you suspect.

359
00:33:51,343 --> 00:33:54,176
Not a duke in 20 reads a word.
Correct, my lord?

360
00:33:55,047 --> 00:33:56,981
Books are for clerks.

361
00:33:59,285 --> 00:34:02,516
How's Mother Jennet?
You find her changed?

362
00:34:02,989 --> 00:34:05,150
I didn't find her. She'd gone off.

363
00:34:08,062 --> 00:34:10,326
Two decades, and I missed her by a day.

364
00:34:10,397 --> 00:34:14,493
That's odd. I sent her warning
and she answered, "Come and get me."

365
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:17,834
Well, we've both come for nothing.

366
00:34:19,275 --> 00:34:20,799
- So be it.
- I'm ready.

367
00:34:21,944 --> 00:34:24,208
- That's the woman, is it?
- It is.

368
00:34:24,347 --> 00:34:26,372
- By my authority...
- Who is this oaf?

369
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:28,884
- Sir Ranulf de Pudsey.
- I'm your prisoner.

370
00:34:28,952 --> 00:34:30,681
- Come back!
- Let me go.

371
00:34:30,754 --> 00:34:31,914
Release her!

372
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:34,082
- Can't you grow up?
- I'm saving you.

373
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,719
- Arrest them all.
- Not enough men.

374
00:34:36,861 --> 00:34:39,762
- I'm here. I'll do it.
- You'll what?

375
00:34:39,931 --> 00:34:43,128
In King John's name, I charge you. Yield!

376
00:34:43,302 --> 00:34:45,327
I'm trying to.

377
00:34:50,477 --> 00:34:52,672
- Give her to me.
- Here.

378
00:34:57,451 --> 00:34:59,180
I warned him not to.

379
00:35:01,322 --> 00:35:05,190
Oaf or not, he serves the King.
You're still a free man.

380
00:35:05,928 --> 00:35:08,761
- Let me have her and you can go.
- I can't do that.

381
00:35:13,369 --> 00:35:16,998
- Then I shall have to hunt you down.
- Good hunting, Sheriff.

382
00:35:18,442 --> 00:35:20,910
- God help you, Robin.
- lf he will.

383
00:35:25,317 --> 00:35:27,114
So that's Robin Hood.

384
00:35:29,654 --> 00:35:31,121
He's a dead man.

385
00:35:31,824 --> 00:35:32,950
Yes.

386
00:35:33,259 --> 00:35:35,989
But not just anyone's. He's mine.

387
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:39,564
Can you get on your horse, Sir Ranulf?

388
00:35:47,575 --> 00:35:50,476
- I didn't mean to hurt you.
- Nothing hurts.

389
00:35:53,849 --> 00:35:55,840
I couldn't let them take you.

390
00:35:55,918 --> 00:35:58,409
Take me! I was going.

391
00:35:59,889 --> 00:36:01,618
I'll save you from prison.

392
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:04,483
- That I can do.
- It's none of your affair.

393
00:36:04,961 --> 00:36:07,657
I don't know how I look,
but I'm not your Marian.

394
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:11,759
I can't imagine living in the world again,
or even wanting to.

395
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:16,406
- Come morning, I'll go to the sheriff.
- Why? Who would it serve?

396
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:19,343
There's always God.

397
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:23,173
- You went crusading, didn't you?
- Some things are worth dying for.

398
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,550
They had souls too,
the heathen that you killed.

399
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,522
If I should die in prison...
I'd rather not, but if it comes...

400
00:36:38,233 --> 00:36:39,791
...it's for a reason.

401
00:36:39,868 --> 00:36:43,531
I'll have stood for something.
But I won't have taken another life to do it.

402
00:36:45,708 --> 00:36:48,336
What will you do now? Fight the sheriff?

403
00:36:49,413 --> 00:36:51,040
More corpses?

404
00:36:51,848 --> 00:36:53,509
Aren't you sick of it?

405
00:36:58,156 --> 00:37:01,614
On July 12, 1191...

406
00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:04,794
...the mighty Acre fortress fell to Richard.

407
00:37:05,064 --> 00:37:07,362
His one great victory in the Holy Land.

408
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,200
He was sick in bed and never fought.

409
00:37:11,004 --> 00:37:15,441
On August 20, John and I were standing
on the plain outside the city, watching...

410
00:37:15,842 --> 00:37:19,573
...while every Muslim left alive
was marched out in chains.

411
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:25,275
King Richard spared the richest
for ransoming, took the strong for slaves.

412
00:37:27,389 --> 00:37:31,723
And he took all the children
and had them chopped apart.

413
00:37:32,195 --> 00:37:34,823
When that was done,
he had the mothers killed.

414
00:37:36,165 --> 00:37:39,601
When they were all dead,
3,000 bodies on the plain...

415
00:37:40,637 --> 00:37:42,662
...he had them all opened up...

416
00:37:43,006 --> 00:37:46,498
...so their guts could be explored
for gold and precious stones.

417
00:37:49,047 --> 00:37:51,914
Our churchmen on the scene,
and there were many...

418
00:37:53,486 --> 00:37:55,613
...took it for a triumph.

419
00:37:57,356 --> 00:38:00,848
One bishop put on his miter
and led us all in prayer.

420
00:38:02,262 --> 00:38:04,594
And you ask me if I'm sick of it.

421
00:38:08,002 --> 00:38:09,993
Why didn't you come home then?

422
00:38:15,611 --> 00:38:17,135
He was my king.

423
00:38:25,722 --> 00:38:27,917
Come. Walk with me.

424
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:46,003
That's where the kitchen was...

425
00:38:46,312 --> 00:38:48,473
...and over there we stored the ale.

426
00:38:49,817 --> 00:38:51,307
And this...

427
00:38:52,352 --> 00:38:54,445
Was this our house?

428
00:38:57,058 --> 00:38:58,719
As small as that?

429
00:38:59,394 --> 00:39:01,328
The door was here.

430
00:39:02,063 --> 00:39:04,861
I tried so hard to keep it clean.

431
00:39:06,368 --> 00:39:09,030
I was right to love you all those years ago.

432
00:39:17,849 --> 00:39:20,317
It's odd, I know I loved you, but...

433
00:39:20,751 --> 00:39:22,981
...I can't remember how it felt...

434
00:39:23,754 --> 00:39:25,312
...or who I was.

435
00:39:27,459 --> 00:39:30,519
Of all things,
I found peace most difficult to come by.

436
00:39:32,265 --> 00:39:34,790
I suppose I took the church up
out of anger.

437
00:39:36,202 --> 00:39:38,693
It's a blur now, but I think I thought...

438
00:39:38,772 --> 00:39:41,798
...of all men, you would mind most
if I married Jesus.

439
00:39:43,177 --> 00:39:45,509
Not a good beginning.

440
00:39:46,848 --> 00:39:50,944
For months, when it was time to sleep,
I'd think of you.

441
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,650
My confessions were the envy
of the convent.

442
00:39:55,758 --> 00:39:59,285
I said endless prayers.
Did dreadful penance, but...

443
00:40:00,697 --> 00:40:02,597
...nothing helped but time.

444
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,438
I have found peace.

445
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:13,340
I don't dream about you anymore, Robin.

446
00:40:14,647 --> 00:40:17,878
I'll see you back safely
into Nottingham tomorrow.

447
00:40:19,652 --> 00:40:21,916
I think one of my teeth is loose.

448
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:26,015
I never mean to hurt you...

449
00:40:26,359 --> 00:40:28,554
...and yet it's all I ever do.

450
00:40:28,896 --> 00:40:30,488
You never wrote.

451
00:40:30,965 --> 00:40:32,523
I don't know how.

452
00:41:03,636 --> 00:41:04,625
Jesus!

453
00:42:06,974 --> 00:42:08,874
Did you sleep well?

454
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:12,110
- Did you?
- To Nottingham then.

455
00:42:12,547 --> 00:42:16,574
The abbey first. My things
were left behind, in the confusion.

456
00:42:17,019 --> 00:42:20,045
- Well, you'll have to ride with me.
- I always did.

457
00:42:20,456 --> 00:42:22,549
If you still know how.

458
00:42:50,825 --> 00:42:53,953
- I won't be long.
- Mother Jennet!

459
00:42:54,328 --> 00:42:57,388
They've been taken.
We were in the garden, where you left us.

460
00:42:57,499 --> 00:43:00,059
- The men came in.
- The sheriff and the oaf?

461
00:43:00,335 --> 00:43:03,827
We ran. I ran the fastest,
but they caught the others and took them.

462
00:43:04,172 --> 00:43:07,699
- They took them all away!
- lf you'd kept out of this, they'd be here.

463
00:43:08,111 --> 00:43:11,205
You believe that?
You think it's you he wants? It's me.

464
00:43:11,448 --> 00:43:12,881
It's John and me.

465
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:16,218
He's in his castle waiting for us.

466
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:17,951
Take me to Nottingham.

467
00:43:18,188 --> 00:43:21,885
- No, not you, we're going.
- I'll walk there if I have to.

468
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,387
Take them to camp. We'll join you later.

469
00:43:25,196 --> 00:43:27,790
I wish to God I were a man.
I'd knock you down.

470
00:43:28,367 --> 00:43:30,028
Now that's my Marian.

471
00:44:35,443 --> 00:44:36,569
Nottingham.

472
00:44:37,179 --> 00:44:38,646
There she is, John.

473
00:44:40,416 --> 00:44:42,111
You look ridiculous.

474
00:45:08,648 --> 00:45:10,081
He'll never come.

475
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:13,146
I know him.

476
00:45:13,821 --> 00:45:18,155
He's a little bit in love with death.
He flirts. He teases.

477
00:45:19,394 --> 00:45:20,691
I can wait.

478
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,081
They haven't changed a thing.

479
00:46:05,746 --> 00:46:09,477
- Shall we go on?
- Why not? See what there is to see.

480
00:46:10,452 --> 00:46:11,783
No harm in that.

481
00:46:22,065 --> 00:46:23,930
- See anything?
- Not yet.

482
00:46:28,539 --> 00:46:32,703
He knows we're coming.
He'll be waiting, watching.

483
00:46:34,612 --> 00:46:37,740
- Not a soldier anyplace.
- So far.

484
00:46:40,953 --> 00:46:43,751
- Robin.
- Where?

485
00:46:46,326 --> 00:46:48,317
You can't see anything. Just a crowd.

486
00:46:48,628 --> 00:46:50,653
I see a wagon with three horses.

487
00:46:51,231 --> 00:46:53,222
One to pull, but two to push?

488
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:56,801
I'm almost sorry.

489
00:46:58,574 --> 00:47:00,542
Now. At once.

490
00:47:01,543 --> 00:47:02,635
Aye, sir.

491
00:47:09,953 --> 00:47:11,250
What now?

492
00:47:13,357 --> 00:47:15,757
We set up shop. Do you see a table?

493
00:47:25,771 --> 00:47:29,434
- Why not go out and get him?
- Why go out when he'll come in?

494
00:47:33,413 --> 00:47:34,778
There we are.

495
00:47:35,749 --> 00:47:38,149
- It's no good being inside all day.
- What?

496
00:47:38,252 --> 00:47:39,810
Walk where you like.

497
00:47:40,854 --> 00:47:42,947
I don't understand what he means.

498
00:47:46,761 --> 00:47:48,695
Hey, there! You, lad!

499
00:47:49,799 --> 00:47:52,666
- That's not your table. It's ours.
- It was empty.

500
00:47:52,802 --> 00:47:57,136
Makes no difference. What's mine is mine.
Now, get off with you.

501
00:47:57,707 --> 00:48:01,108
- I need it. I'll buy it from you.
- It's not for sale.

502
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:05,572
I'm good at faces. I know you, don't I?

503
00:48:08,586 --> 00:48:10,247
I could have sworn that...

504
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:12,848
That's not your wagon.

505
00:48:13,459 --> 00:48:17,589
Fat man, been here all week from Bristol.
He left this morning.

506
00:48:19,699 --> 00:48:21,064
Be you thieves?

507
00:48:21,968 --> 00:48:23,230
Take the lot.

508
00:48:24,638 --> 00:48:27,163
- Fair's fair, and that's too much.
- Listen.

509
00:48:27,541 --> 00:48:32,945
If you don't move,
I'll have to split you from here to there.

510
00:48:35,817 --> 00:48:36,806
John.

511
00:48:48,098 --> 00:48:49,963
It's madness going in there.

512
00:48:50,734 --> 00:48:54,033
There's only one way in.
They'll bang the gate down on us.

513
00:48:55,406 --> 00:48:57,533
We could always come back tomorrow.

514
00:49:02,181 --> 00:49:03,170
Look.

515
00:49:16,564 --> 00:49:19,362
Skillets, pipkins! London-made!

516
00:49:22,204 --> 00:49:23,831
Just pots and pans.

517
00:49:24,106 --> 00:49:27,701
Pots and pans!

518
00:49:28,111 --> 00:49:30,079
Pots and pans, Sisters?

519
00:49:31,047 --> 00:49:34,915
- There's a yellow wagon beyond the gate.
- You're not supposed to be here.

520
00:49:35,986 --> 00:49:40,355
- Can you see it?
- We can't buy your pots, we're prisoners.

521
00:49:40,891 --> 00:49:45,123
- God almighty! Can you see the wagon?
- You've profaned the Lord's name.

522
00:49:45,597 --> 00:49:48,532
- Who are you?
- Jesus Christ!

523
00:49:49,468 --> 00:49:53,097
I'm a friend of Mother Jennet's,
and if we don't get out, we'll all die.

524
00:49:58,045 --> 00:49:59,706
Cut it, for Christ's sake.

525
00:50:00,681 --> 00:50:01,670
Move!

526
00:50:44,364 --> 00:50:45,422
Up.

527
00:50:59,648 --> 00:51:02,776
Where in hell are your crossbowmen?
Get them out here!

528
00:51:29,683 --> 00:51:31,480
This is murder.

529
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:51,368
Those bloody nuns.

530
00:52:54,006 --> 00:52:55,337
After them!

531
00:53:19,498 --> 00:53:20,590
God!

532
00:53:25,171 --> 00:53:27,435
- There's Robin Hood.
- Which one?

533
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,132
Him.
