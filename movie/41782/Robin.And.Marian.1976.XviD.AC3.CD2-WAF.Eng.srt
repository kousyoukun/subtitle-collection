1
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,872
- Mother! There's barely time.
- Go on!

2
00:00:38,814 --> 00:00:40,179
Do as they ask!

3
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:58,229
- Robin!
- Jump!

4
00:01:02,737 --> 00:01:05,570
- I'll hurt myself.
- For Christ's sake.

5
00:01:32,901 --> 00:01:34,095
That's him.

6
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:09,360
I should have taught you better.

7
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:15,007
Two old men, for Jesus' sake.
Two old men.

8
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:22,415
This one's still alive. You take care of him.

9
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:24,741
As for the rest of them...

10
00:02:25,754 --> 00:02:27,847
...take up their limbs and bury them.

11
00:02:28,256 --> 00:02:29,382
You!

12
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,426
You, there!

13
00:02:37,065 --> 00:02:40,466
- Raise it! Raise the gate!
- I can't, my lord. How?

14
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,465
I ought to let you go.

15
00:02:45,073 --> 00:02:46,563
I'll bring him back.

16
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:51,211
Bring him back from Sherwood?
You won't even find him.

17
00:02:51,913 --> 00:02:54,507
- I can do it.
- In full armor, in the woods?

18
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:59,610
You'll sink up to your armpits in the bogs.
I've tried it. I've gone in after him.

19
00:02:59,821 --> 00:03:04,281
I never even saw his archers.
Just the arrows in my soldiers' bodies.

20
00:03:05,961 --> 00:03:08,691
I can get him, and you failed.

21
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,456
And you don't like it.

22
00:03:13,602 --> 00:03:15,331
All right. Get some men.

23
00:03:17,606 --> 00:03:19,164
Raise the gates.

24
00:03:38,493 --> 00:03:41,519
Here. Take this. Give me your bow.

25
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:44,027
Get up there, keep watch.

26
00:03:44,332 --> 00:03:46,732
Come on.

27
00:03:48,536 --> 00:03:50,800
Come on!

28
00:03:51,373 --> 00:03:52,533
Get up!

29
00:03:55,844 --> 00:03:58,438
I can't keep doing
this kind of thing anymore.

30
00:04:22,337 --> 00:04:24,100
There. That's all right.

31
00:05:00,775 --> 00:05:02,003
Turn left!

32
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,278
- Turn left!
- No, no.

33
00:05:22,397 --> 00:05:23,523
No!

34
00:05:30,105 --> 00:05:33,404
- She never did have the touch for driving.
- Are you all right?

35
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:38,410
- Do you think they'll come after us?
- We'll hear from Will if they do.

36
00:05:43,318 --> 00:05:44,683
Are you all right?

37
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:48,182
There's not another Mother Abbess
like you in the world.

38
00:05:48,823 --> 00:05:51,986
- Amen to that. You're a marvel.
- Your face! Blood!

39
00:05:52,427 --> 00:05:53,519
Blood?

40
00:05:57,599 --> 00:05:59,624
You fool.

41
00:06:06,775 --> 00:06:08,367
You've put on weight.

42
00:06:20,221 --> 00:06:24,248
Was this a day!
I haven't had one like it since we left.

43
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:26,149
Neither have I.

44
00:06:26,895 --> 00:06:30,262
- Did we really used to do this sort of thing?
- All the time.

45
00:06:32,967 --> 00:06:34,400
How did I bear it?

46
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,007
When I saw you on that wall,
I thought I saw you dead.

47
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,944
Why did I ever leave?

48
00:06:55,723 --> 00:06:57,520
Let's take a look at you.

49
00:06:58,526 --> 00:07:03,122
- Just a few bumps and bruises.
- All the same.

50
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,538
So many.

51
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,546
You had the sweetest body when you left.

52
00:07:23,051 --> 00:07:25,645
Hard, and not a mark.

53
00:07:27,422 --> 00:07:28,946
And you were mine.

54
00:07:31,526 --> 00:07:33,494
When you left, I thought I'd die.

55
00:07:35,263 --> 00:07:36,787
I even tried.

56
00:07:37,932 --> 00:07:42,926
I walked out in the woods near camp,
and laid down by a stream and cut myself.

57
00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:48,976
Some damn fool forester came by
and took me to the abbey, so they say.

58
00:07:52,113 --> 00:07:56,174
No more scars, Robin.
It's too much to lose you twice.

59
00:07:59,287 --> 00:08:03,314
I've never kissed a member of the clergy.
Would it be a sin?

60
00:08:27,815 --> 00:08:30,579
They're coming in.
Tuck, we'll need your bow!

61
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,045
Right!

62
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:38,048
- Hasn't there been enough?
- I'll meet you back at camp.

63
00:08:38,126 --> 00:08:41,220
- Don't go.
- I just want to see who's hunting me.

64
00:10:29,904 --> 00:10:31,064
Come on!

65
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,036
Oaf!

66
00:10:40,715 --> 00:10:44,708
Next time you ride into Sherwood,
keep your visor down.

67
00:10:45,586 --> 00:10:47,349
John! Wait.

68
00:10:53,828 --> 00:10:56,228
I hold my office from the King himself.

69
00:10:57,098 --> 00:10:58,998
I never liked your king much.

70
00:10:59,467 --> 00:11:02,436
You're his subject and his servant.

71
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:05,170
He's not king here. Not in Sherwood.

72
00:11:05,573 --> 00:11:08,133
You're the ruler, are you? Should I bow?

73
00:11:09,143 --> 00:11:11,668
I wouldn't have you in my service,
nobleman.

74
00:11:12,613 --> 00:11:16,447
I've known your kind all my life.
You're everything I meant to fight.

75
00:11:16,918 --> 00:11:18,408
You're the enemy.

76
00:11:19,187 --> 00:11:22,452
You gobble good red meat,
and we get bread and cheese.

77
00:11:23,191 --> 00:11:26,752
The laws can't touch you and
there's no crime you can be punished for.

78
00:11:27,528 --> 00:11:29,996
We can shoot a deer
and have our eyes put out.

79
00:11:33,801 --> 00:11:35,564
This is my forest.

80
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,966
I'll live here as I like.

81
00:11:39,841 --> 00:11:42,674
You come in again and I'll kill you.

82
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,713
Steady.

83
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,251
Good.

84
00:11:59,494 --> 00:12:01,519
- Was there fighting?
- Some.

85
00:12:01,863 --> 00:12:04,730
- You promised you would only look.
- Christ!

86
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:09,800
My father worked an honest day for years.
He left behind a pot, a blanket and a spoon.

87
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,871
The sheriff?

88
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,405
No, the oaf.

89
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,172
- You didn't kill him?
- No.

90
00:12:18,713 --> 00:12:22,581
I told him it was my forest, it's all I want.
I want to live here with you.

91
00:12:46,274 --> 00:12:47,798
What are you looking for?

92
00:12:49,343 --> 00:12:52,574
Some trace of Marian. Or Mother Jennet.

93
00:12:54,182 --> 00:12:55,547
Either one.

94
00:12:57,685 --> 00:12:59,050
Good woman, Jennet.

95
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,381
Years of diligence it took to leave
the flesh behind, but she achieved it.

96
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:06,183
She could look at men and feel nothing.

97
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,125
See? She looks at you.

98
00:13:11,866 --> 00:13:14,300
Touch her hand. Hold it.

99
00:13:16,304 --> 00:13:19,398
Just as well. She wouldn't feel anything.

100
00:13:22,076 --> 00:13:24,738
I think of what I did and it makes no sense.

101
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,442
To want to die from wanting you.

102
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,286
Some other girl it must have been.

103
00:13:35,056 --> 00:13:36,387
Let me hold you.

104
00:13:37,992 --> 00:13:39,152
Robin...

105
00:13:44,232 --> 00:13:46,928
...were there many women
on your great Crusade?

106
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,935
- Lots.
- Don't tell me.

107
00:13:53,608 --> 00:13:55,439
- As you wish.
- How many?

108
00:14:00,147 --> 00:14:02,206
But they all looked like you.

109
00:14:11,859 --> 00:14:13,486
Am I old and ugly?

110
00:14:15,796 --> 00:14:17,525
Am I anything you'd want?

111
00:14:25,606 --> 00:14:27,938
I've felt so little for so long.

112
00:14:32,947 --> 00:14:34,039
Robin...

113
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,115
...hurt me.

114
00:14:38,719 --> 00:14:40,277
Make me cry.

115
00:15:29,937 --> 00:15:31,734
I can't stop smiling.

116
00:15:32,673 --> 00:15:34,038
I don't mind.

117
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,207
Could there be two rooms
to our house next time?

118
00:15:41,248 --> 00:15:43,148
And something for a floor?

119
00:15:44,385 --> 00:15:46,853
- All right.
- I'd like that.

120
00:15:48,723 --> 00:15:50,486
And a bed with blankets?

121
00:15:52,059 --> 00:15:54,892
And a chest for clothes, and...

122
00:16:10,811 --> 00:16:12,142
Do you hear that?

123
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,945
Jesus Christ almighty! Don't.

124
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,950
You do be Robin Hood, yes?

125
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,182
I'll be damned!

126
00:16:25,326 --> 00:16:28,625
I told them in the market it was you.
It's Robin, lads!

127
00:16:28,896 --> 00:16:30,363
I told you so!

128
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:36,092
"Robin's back in Sherwood," I said.
I led them because I knew the way.

129
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:39,472
They're mostly from farms
round about here.

130
00:16:40,508 --> 00:16:44,308
They're here to serve you, Robin,
and fight against that king.

131
00:16:45,646 --> 00:16:47,978
Tuck! Give them all food.

132
00:17:00,194 --> 00:17:01,752
So be it, then.

133
00:17:03,097 --> 00:17:05,588
Go fight your sheriffs and your kings.

134
00:17:06,367 --> 00:17:08,631
I love you and you make me proud.

135
00:17:10,137 --> 00:17:15,575
But if there were a way to turn time back
just five minutes, I'd give my soul to do it.

136
00:17:52,313 --> 00:17:56,306
- You ladies, there. Where is the King?
- In the largest tent, of course.

137
00:18:10,998 --> 00:18:14,934
So, you go to the Pope and you tell him...

138
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:20,566
...if his archbishop puts one foot
in England, I'll cut his head off!

139
00:18:21,876 --> 00:18:23,241
What's next?

140
00:18:24,078 --> 00:18:25,306
John.

141
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,948
- Aren't you ever coming?
- Soon.

142
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,583
I clean all over. Want to look?

143
00:18:36,056 --> 00:18:37,546
The court is here.

144
00:18:39,026 --> 00:18:41,790
I don't mind. I think you're pretty.

145
00:18:53,407 --> 00:18:55,466
What in God's name do you want?

146
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:59,168
- Men, Your Majesty. Two hundred men.
- Two hundred...

147
00:18:59,914 --> 00:19:02,781
- What for?
- To fight an enemy, my lord.

148
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,115
- What enemy? There are so many.
- Robin Hood.

149
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,819
I thought the man was dead.

150
00:19:10,824 --> 00:19:12,416
He's back in Sherwood.

151
00:19:13,561 --> 00:19:16,894
Can't the sheriff manage it?
Must I waste my time on a common thief?

152
00:19:16,997 --> 00:19:20,694
My army waits for me in Dover,
and I go to France in the morning. God!

153
00:19:20,901 --> 00:19:25,998
These people have made a hero of him.
They're flocking to him in hundreds.

154
00:19:27,107 --> 00:19:28,631
He's become a legend.

155
00:19:30,077 --> 00:19:32,671
Have you ever tried to fight a legend?

156
00:19:34,315 --> 00:19:37,113
- Just my brother.
- But, sire...

157
00:19:38,485 --> 00:19:40,612
...they mean to rise against you.

158
00:19:41,088 --> 00:19:42,316
Do they?

159
00:19:43,357 --> 00:19:44,483
Do they?

160
00:19:46,594 --> 00:19:49,529
Be in Dover in the morning.
I'll give you what men I can.

161
00:19:50,264 --> 00:19:55,668
And you tell the sheriff,
I'll have Robin's head, or I'll have his.

162
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:00,267
Either way, I'll win.

163
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,308
Are you sure these berries make it green?

164
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:49,779
Keep your bow arm straight,
and pull it back to your chin.

165
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,717
- Like that.
- Which arm?

166
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,322
All right. Two! Three!

167
00:21:33,267 --> 00:21:34,962
The King was generous.

168
00:21:35,135 --> 00:21:37,797
He sends a message.
He wants Robin's head.

169
00:21:39,073 --> 00:21:40,335
Or mine.

170
00:21:42,209 --> 00:21:45,406
- Follow me.
- These troops are under my command.

171
00:21:47,214 --> 00:21:50,809
Not in my county. Follow me!

172
00:21:53,587 --> 00:21:55,248
This way!

173
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,154
- What, here?
- This is close enough.

174
00:22:34,628 --> 00:22:37,256
- How many?
- Enough.

175
00:22:38,465 --> 00:22:40,160
And they're making camp.

176
00:22:40,434 --> 00:22:41,958
There in the field?

177
00:22:44,638 --> 00:22:48,904
- I'd thought they'd come in after us.
- They'll come.

178
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,877
- Will! Tuck!
- What's wrong?

179
00:22:57,217 --> 00:23:01,051
The sheriff's out there with an army,
100 soldiers, maybe more, and good ones.

180
00:23:01,121 --> 00:23:03,521
- Where are they?
- Making camp, near Kirkly.

181
00:23:03,724 --> 00:23:07,524
They'll be coming in at dawn.
I want us in position by tonight.

182
00:24:05,085 --> 00:24:07,417
These pears are absolutely delicious.

183
00:24:13,227 --> 00:24:16,321
Damnedest thing.
He's still eating breakfast!

184
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,790
Still?

185
00:24:19,032 --> 00:24:21,523
What's he waiting for? More men?

186
00:24:21,935 --> 00:24:24,403
You'd think he had enough.

187
00:24:25,205 --> 00:24:26,536
What do we do?

188
00:24:27,474 --> 00:24:28,907
We wait and see.

189
00:25:22,362 --> 00:25:23,351
Come along.

190
00:25:25,165 --> 00:25:26,359
Come on.

191
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,546
No, thank you.

192
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:54,022
Come on, come on!

193
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,096
Now!

194
00:26:08,976 --> 00:26:10,204
Let's go!

195
00:26:14,314 --> 00:26:16,441
Call your men to sword!

196
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:19,075
It's an attack, my lord.

197
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,121
Call to arms, foot soldiers!

198
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:27,087
What happened?

199
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,889
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

200
00:26:29,396 --> 00:26:31,296
We attacked. No one followed us.

201
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:36,433
- Are we to fight them in the open?
- That seems to be the plan.

202
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:40,034
We'd be slaughtered.
Does he think we're fools?

203
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,367
That's what he's waiting for, I know it.

204
00:26:44,177 --> 00:26:45,769
He's the fool, then.

205
00:26:46,446 --> 00:26:50,109
He can sit out there forever.
He can't put a forest under siege.

206
00:26:51,918 --> 00:26:54,648
That's how I see it.
He comes in, we've got him.

207
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:57,354
- We stay here.
- The man is mad.

208
00:26:57,924 --> 00:26:59,915
You haven't asked what I think.

209
00:27:01,762 --> 00:27:03,593
I think one madman's enough.

210
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:07,763
He's out there, Marian. He expects me.

211
00:27:08,969 --> 00:27:10,197
Let him.

212
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:33,954
The mist is rising.

213
00:27:34,594 --> 00:27:36,653
You look so cold.

214
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,333
It's so beautiful, this place.

215
00:27:41,068 --> 00:27:43,662
The woods just now. Full of noises...

216
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:46,472
...everything so alive.

217
00:27:47,174 --> 00:27:48,766
I kept thinking...

218
00:27:49,142 --> 00:27:51,167
...of all the death I've seen.

219
00:27:52,512 --> 00:27:55,743
I've hardly lost a battle,
and I don't know what I've won.

220
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:02,753
"The day is ours, Robin," you used to say.
And then it was tomorrow.

221
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,819
But where did the day go?

222
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,597
You're so beautiful.

223
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,130
Come and sit by me.

224
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,876
Do you love me?

225
00:28:26,179 --> 00:28:27,339
Say it.

226
00:28:28,548 --> 00:28:30,175
What's the matter?

227
00:28:32,352 --> 00:28:33,512
Nothing.

228
00:28:34,488 --> 00:28:35,819
Nothing.

229
00:28:41,728 --> 00:28:45,494
- You're going, aren't you?
- It's a possibility.

230
00:28:46,967 --> 00:28:50,494
You heard John, and Will, and Tuck.
They said it was madness.

231
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:53,171
Well...

232
00:28:55,675 --> 00:28:58,041
Is that all being dead means? "Well..."

233
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,546
I'll have more to say when the time comes.

234
00:29:02,516 --> 00:29:05,314
Let it be God's time.
He'll take you soon enough.

235
00:29:05,852 --> 00:29:08,082
Then it's all in his hands.

236
00:29:09,923 --> 00:29:13,450
You think I'm gray and old. Well, I'm not.

237
00:29:15,695 --> 00:29:19,426
Robin, I'd be 20 for you if I could.

238
00:29:21,334 --> 00:29:23,097
I'm all I ever was.

239
00:29:25,772 --> 00:29:27,399
You saw me on the wall.

240
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,104
Yes.

241
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:38,242
If you come back,
there'll be another morning, won't there?

242
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:39,478
And another.

243
00:29:41,588 --> 00:29:44,819
And each time you'll be less.
Not Robin anymore.

244
00:29:47,093 --> 00:29:49,254
- And then one day...
- You'll see.

245
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:52,561
No, I won't see.

246
00:29:53,466 --> 00:29:57,732
Or hear the songs about bold Robin.
I'll be gone.

247
00:29:59,906 --> 00:30:02,204
Leave? Why?

248
00:30:04,744 --> 00:30:07,508
Because I'll do everything for you
but mourn.

249
00:30:08,648 --> 00:30:12,106
Go fight your sheriff,
and may God go with you.

250
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,346
May the sun shine and the day be great.

251
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,788
But, Robin...

252
00:30:22,662 --> 00:30:24,630
...I never want to know.

253
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,699
John.

254
00:30:36,977 --> 00:30:40,242
I'll do anything you say. I'll leave here.

255
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:44,514
I'll go as if he never found me.
Only stop him from this thing.

256
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:48,745
- What thing?
- His march against the sheriff.

257
00:30:49,589 --> 00:30:52,080
- What?
- Didn't he tell you?

258
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:57,428
Fight the sheriff? Don't be mad.
It's four-to-one. We'd be slaughtered.

259
00:31:00,934 --> 00:31:04,392
What's he thinking?
These are boys we've got. They're farmers.

260
00:31:04,471 --> 00:31:07,338
Tell him! You're the only one. He'll listen.

261
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:10,205
Me? Say no to Rob?

262
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:13,473
Just this once.

263
00:31:14,447 --> 00:31:16,506
We've always been together.

264
00:31:18,151 --> 00:31:20,312
I'd be nothing without him.

265
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,653
I want him safe, that's all. I said I'd leave.

266
00:31:23,857 --> 00:31:25,757
What more do you want from me?

267
00:31:27,027 --> 00:31:28,927
I haven't asked for anything.

268
00:31:31,197 --> 00:31:32,892
You never liked me much.

269
00:31:37,871 --> 00:31:40,772
- You're Rob's lady.
- Go on, say it.

270
00:31:42,842 --> 00:31:44,639
You're Rob's lady.

271
00:31:45,879 --> 00:31:46,868
lf...

272
00:31:48,481 --> 00:31:51,211
...you'd been mine,
I never would have left you.

273
00:32:05,265 --> 00:32:06,960
Damn you!

274
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:13,629
You've had him with you.
You've had years! I'm going to lose him.

275
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,708
- No, you won't.
- Oh, John!

276
00:32:20,613 --> 00:32:22,444
Oh, John!

277
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,911
I'll watch over him.

278
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:30,517
Don't cry.

279
00:32:31,124 --> 00:32:32,819
He'll be back.

280
00:32:41,034 --> 00:32:42,399
We're going out.

281
00:32:43,103 --> 00:32:44,297
Yes, I know.

282
00:32:44,704 --> 00:32:46,035
She told you?

283
00:32:46,406 --> 00:32:48,670
- Yes.
- Well?

284
00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:51,504
She asked me not to go.

285
00:32:52,645 --> 00:32:54,476
And you decided what?

286
00:32:56,149 --> 00:32:57,616
It's mad, Rob.

287
00:32:58,218 --> 00:32:59,378
And?

288
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,382
Well...

289
00:33:02,655 --> 00:33:05,715
I told her you'd be lost without me.

290
00:33:09,596 --> 00:33:11,962
This could be the hardest part of the day.

291
00:33:12,098 --> 00:33:13,292
I doubt it.

292
00:33:36,456 --> 00:33:38,788
- Goodbye.
- What?

293
00:33:41,161 --> 00:33:42,856
God keep you well.

294
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:46,726
If he so chooses.

295
00:34:56,369 --> 00:34:59,361
- Come on!
- Move yourself...

296
00:35:35,141 --> 00:35:36,506
Move!

297
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:40,746
All right, you men, put it here. And hold it!

298
00:35:45,385 --> 00:35:46,909
Sit still!

299
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:03,164
Await your orders.

300
00:36:12,845 --> 00:36:14,244
I knew you'd come.

301
00:36:15,248 --> 00:36:17,580
Of all men, just for you.

302
00:36:18,251 --> 00:36:19,411
I know.

303
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:23,955
- I want to settle this with champions.
- One of your men against mine?

304
00:36:24,591 --> 00:36:26,320
The winner takes the day.

305
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,588
Why should I, Robin?

306
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:32,194
The odds are four-to-one.
Why should I make them even?

307
00:36:34,167 --> 00:36:35,794
I'm one champion.

308
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,204
And I'm the other?

309
00:36:40,506 --> 00:36:42,633
If I lose, my men are yours.

310
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,879
Without me, they won't trouble you.
They'll go home again.

311
00:36:46,946 --> 00:36:48,243
And if I lose?

312
00:36:49,449 --> 00:36:51,542
Your soldiers leave the field.

313
00:36:54,354 --> 00:36:56,754
Those are my orders. Are they clear?

314
00:36:57,290 --> 00:37:00,157
I let this rabble go? Just march away?

315
00:37:01,327 --> 00:37:03,158
Those are my orders.

316
00:37:03,396 --> 00:37:04,863
Leave the field!

317
00:37:16,376 --> 00:37:19,709
I promised I'd watch out for you.
I promised her.

318
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,707
She's gone, in any case.

319
00:37:23,149 --> 00:37:25,413
- I'll kill him, Rob, if you don't.
- No!

320
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:28,749
What you do is keep my word.

321
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,586
I'll see you, John.

322
00:37:35,928 --> 00:37:37,259
Off you go.

323
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:09,992
God be with us, Robin.

324
00:38:42,428 --> 00:38:43,918
Go get him, Robin!

325
00:38:45,331 --> 00:38:47,162
As I thought. See?

326
00:38:57,744 --> 00:38:59,234
Go, Lord Sheriff!

327
00:40:00,206 --> 00:40:01,195
Go on.

328
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,285
Come on, Robin.

329
00:41:03,736 --> 00:41:06,227
- Will you not yield?
- No!

330
00:41:07,139 --> 00:41:08,697
I'm tired.

331
00:41:14,747 --> 00:41:16,214
Marian!

332
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:20,216
I couldn't stop him.

333
00:41:39,605 --> 00:41:41,732
For the love of God, Robin!

334
00:43:08,561 --> 00:43:09,721
All right?

335
00:43:11,731 --> 00:43:14,097
We've got to get the men into the woods.

336
00:43:42,928 --> 00:43:44,327
You're a stout lad.

337
00:43:44,397 --> 00:43:47,594
- What's your name?
- They call me Little John.

338
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,189
Well met.

339
00:43:49,769 --> 00:43:51,259
Let's see how tall you are.

340
00:43:55,074 --> 00:43:56,268
Robin!

341
00:43:56,942 --> 00:43:59,843
- Look at you.
- You came back.

342
00:44:00,212 --> 00:44:01,577
Can you hold him?

343
00:44:01,714 --> 00:44:04,649
We'll take him to the abbey.
My medicines are there.

344
00:44:36,015 --> 00:44:40,111
I thought I'd seen the last of you.
A woman of your word.

345
00:44:40,853 --> 00:44:42,684
I'm glad you came back.

346
00:44:59,939 --> 00:45:01,429
Up there.

347
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,944
Stand still!

348
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:33,904
I wonder where the day went?

349
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:36,799
Vespers it must be.

350
00:45:37,543 --> 00:45:41,980
What kind of abbey is this?
No one rings the hours.

351
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:44,480
Are you in great pain?

352
00:45:45,818 --> 00:45:47,410
A little weary.

353
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,485
I've had worse.

354
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,927
He went down well, the sheriff did.
Brave man.

355
00:45:58,731 --> 00:46:00,722
And the better one today.

356
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:04,330
The years...
The years, they whittle at you.

357
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:09,407
I should give it up, you know.

358
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:13,336
I doubt I'll have a day like this again.
And yet...

359
00:46:15,548 --> 00:46:16,674
John!

360
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:22,977
- lf they should follow us...
- I'll wait outside.

361
00:46:23,589 --> 00:46:25,784
- I did my best.
- I know.

362
00:46:46,745 --> 00:46:48,576
This will help the pain.

363
00:46:53,919 --> 00:46:55,910
He's something, John is.

364
00:46:56,755 --> 00:46:58,814
No one's gentler in the world...

365
00:46:59,058 --> 00:47:00,753
...nor half as terrible.

366
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:03,017
Did you see him?

367
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:16,099
I should go and tend my men.

368
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:18,142
Brave boys, all of them.

369
00:47:18,577 --> 00:47:20,408
I meant to...

370
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:23,815
I like your medicine.

371
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,484
There's no pain at all.

372
00:47:36,695 --> 00:47:39,186
We'll have a time in the forest.

373
00:47:39,698 --> 00:47:43,190
You'll tend me till I'm well again.
And then...

374
00:47:43,802 --> 00:47:45,667
...great battles!

375
00:47:45,871 --> 00:47:47,930
We'll have a life to sing about.

376
00:47:55,848 --> 00:47:57,247
My...

377
00:47:57,883 --> 00:47:59,544
...legs are cold.

378
00:48:00,753 --> 00:48:02,084
I know.

379
00:48:03,956 --> 00:48:05,389
They're numb.

380
00:48:05,791 --> 00:48:08,453
I said you would have no pain.

381
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:13,459
What have you done?

382
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:20,833
John!

383
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:23,272
I'm poisoned!

384
00:48:24,877 --> 00:48:25,969
Help me!

385
00:48:26,312 --> 00:48:28,507
No one can help you now.

386
00:48:30,482 --> 00:48:32,177
Jesus, Marian!

387
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:42,988
Why?

388
00:48:47,666 --> 00:48:49,065
I love you.

389
00:48:52,404 --> 00:48:54,235
More than all you know.

390
00:48:56,842 --> 00:48:58,776
I love you more than children.

391
00:49:02,848 --> 00:49:06,545
More than fields
I've planted with my hands.

392
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:13,422
I love you more than morning prayers...

393
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,357
...or peace...

394
00:49:17,262 --> 00:49:19,287
...or food to eat.

395
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,093
I love you more than sunlight...

396
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:28,130
...more than flesh or joy...

397
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:31,006
...or one more day.

398
00:49:36,782 --> 00:49:38,374
I love you...

399
00:49:40,085 --> 00:49:42,076
...more than God.

400
00:49:45,457 --> 00:49:48,654
I'd never have a day like this again,
would I?

401
00:49:56,235 --> 00:49:58,260
Well, it's better this way.

402
00:50:05,744 --> 00:50:06,904
Marian.

403
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:20,781
It's all right.

404
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:24,055
Rob.

405
00:50:26,832 --> 00:50:28,163
Look at you.

406
00:50:28,867 --> 00:50:30,300
It's all right.

407
00:50:32,204 --> 00:50:33,569
It's all right.

408
00:50:36,375 --> 00:50:37,603
No.

409
00:50:39,678 --> 00:50:40,667
No.

410
00:50:43,348 --> 00:50:45,145
Give me my bow.

411
00:51:02,534 --> 00:51:04,468
Where this falls, John...

412
00:51:05,704 --> 00:51:07,399
...put us close...

413
00:51:08,707 --> 00:51:10,299
...and leave us there.
