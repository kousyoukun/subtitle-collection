1
00:06:05,818 --> 00:06:07,948
I think I see him!

2
00:06:22,418 --> 00:06:23,798
This way!

3
00:08:08,106 --> 00:08:09,976
- Five.
- Great.

4
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:12,816
You got an arrow right in your chest.

5
00:08:12,896 --> 00:08:14,816
Don't worry. I got resurrection.

6
00:08:14,906 --> 00:08:16,446
I'm already one of the undead.

7
00:08:16,526 --> 00:08:18,406
I can still throw death spells.

8
00:08:18,486 --> 00:08:20,286
Just trying to help you out, man.

9
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:22,656
How about throwing a spell over the pizza man?

10
00:08:22,746 --> 00:08:24,746
Where's our pizza, man?

11
00:08:25,076 --> 00:08:27,416
I'm ready as of now to play.

12
00:08:27,626 --> 00:08:29,666
I'm ready to play now, you guys.

13
00:08:29,746 --> 00:08:32,876
We're in the middle, Elliott.
You can't join in the middle.

14
00:08:32,966 --> 00:08:34,336
I got him!

15
00:08:35,126 --> 00:08:36,636
What am I asking for?

16
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:40,005
Papa-oom-mow-mow.
Papa-oom-mow-mow.

17
00:08:40,805 --> 00:08:41,925
Mike?

18
00:08:42,095 --> 00:08:44,015
It's not for us, it's for his mother.

19
00:08:45,095 --> 00:08:46,265
Mike?

20
00:08:47,265 --> 00:08:51,265
Ask Steve. He's game master.
He has absolute power.

21
00:08:51,355 --> 00:08:52,315
Steve?

22
00:08:52,395 --> 00:08:54,355
Steve, can I play now?

23
00:08:54,775 --> 00:08:56,395
Go wait for the pizza first.

24
00:08:56,485 --> 00:08:58,155
Then I'm in?
You're in.

25
00:08:58,235 --> 00:09:01,325
Figure out your strategy.
You're playing after Greg.

26
00:09:02,865 --> 00:09:05,205
Plenty of sausage and pepperonis.

27
00:09:05,285 --> 00:09:07,615
Everything but the little fishies.

28
00:09:41,944 --> 00:09:43,404
Harvey?

29
00:09:44,234 --> 00:09:46,324
Harvey, is that you, boy?

30
00:09:52,534 --> 00:09:53,954
Over here, you guys.

31
00:09:54,044 --> 00:09:55,794
Stop it.
Sorry.

32
00:10:05,094 --> 00:10:06,134
Harvey?

33
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:51,133
All's you get is those 40-year-olds.
How do you win this game?

34
00:10:51,973 --> 00:10:54,303
It's like life. You don't win at life.
Money helps.

35
00:10:55,223 --> 00:10:57,473
Mom! There's something out...

36
00:10:57,563 --> 00:10:59,103
Where's the pizza?

37
00:10:59,183 --> 00:11:02,063
There's something out there!
In the toolshed.

38
00:11:02,143 --> 00:11:04,443
It threw the ball at me.

39
00:11:04,523 --> 00:11:05,733
Quiet!

40
00:11:06,653 --> 00:11:08,693
Nobody go out there.

41
00:11:12,403 --> 00:11:14,743
Stop. Now, you guys stay right here.

42
00:11:14,823 --> 00:11:17,033
You stay here, Mom. We'll check it out.

43
00:11:17,123 --> 00:11:19,373
And put those knives back!

44
00:11:21,663 --> 00:11:23,083
It's okay, Elliott.

45
00:11:23,173 --> 00:11:25,333
Let's go get the flashlight.

46
00:11:27,093 --> 00:11:29,093
Hold it. Wait a minute.

47
00:11:30,173 --> 00:11:32,383
Creeps. Creepy.

48
00:11:32,473 --> 00:11:34,593
What exactly did you see?

49
00:11:34,973 --> 00:11:36,053
In there.

50
00:11:38,853 --> 00:11:40,313
It's scary.

51
00:11:44,652 --> 00:11:46,232
There's nothing in here.

52
00:11:46,312 --> 00:11:47,772
The gate's open.

53
00:11:48,152 --> 00:11:49,652
Look at these.

54
00:11:55,662 --> 00:11:57,572
Coyote's come back again, Mom.

55
00:11:57,662 --> 00:12:00,292
Okay, party's over.
Everybody, back inside now.

56
00:12:00,372 --> 00:12:01,752
Get out. Hurry up.

57
00:12:01,832 --> 00:12:03,122
Quick. Hurry up.

58
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:05,332
Tyler, give me that knife.

59
00:12:07,462 --> 00:12:09,672
Great. Nice one, Elliott.

60
00:12:09,752 --> 00:12:11,252
It was an accident.

61
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:15,012
Who said you guys could order a pizza?

62
00:12:15,092 --> 00:12:16,512
Him.

63
00:12:17,222 --> 00:12:19,642
In the house.
You geek, man.

64
00:12:19,892 --> 00:12:21,312
Mom, it was real.

65
00:12:21,972 --> 00:12:23,062
Douche bag.

66
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,982
No douche-bag talk in my house.

67
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,671
Elliott, you're crazy.

68
00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:41,209
Hello.

69
00:15:53,468 --> 00:15:54,638
Hello?

70
00:16:46,738 --> 00:16:48,857
What are you going as for Halloween?

71
00:16:48,947 --> 00:16:52,447
- I'm not going to stupid Halloween.
- Go as a goblin.

72
00:16:52,697 --> 00:16:54,027
Shut up.

73
00:16:54,117 --> 00:16:56,287
It's not that we don't believe you, honey.

74
00:16:56,367 --> 00:16:58,327
Well, it was real. I swear.

75
00:17:00,957 --> 00:17:03,087
What are you going as, Gert?

76
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:05,547
I'm going as a cowgirl.

77
00:17:05,747 --> 00:17:08,047
So what else is new?

78
00:17:08,877 --> 00:17:11,887
- Maybe it was an iguana.
- It was no iguana.

79
00:17:11,967 --> 00:17:13,427
Maybe a...

80
00:17:14,097 --> 00:17:16,887
You know how they say
there are alligators in the sewers?

81
00:17:16,967 --> 00:17:18,927
Alligators in the sewers.

82
00:17:19,137 --> 00:17:22,517
All we're trying to say is,
maybe you imagined it.

83
00:17:22,597 --> 00:17:24,227
I couldn't have.

84
00:17:24,307 --> 00:17:28,437
- Maybe it was a pervert or a deformed kid.
- A deformed kid.

85
00:17:28,987 --> 00:17:31,157
Maybe an elf or a leprechaun.

86
00:17:31,237 --> 00:17:33,237
It was nothing like that, penis breath!

87
00:17:33,317 --> 00:17:34,987
Elliott!

88
00:17:35,407 --> 00:17:37,157
Sit down.

89
00:17:40,457 --> 00:17:42,207
Dad would believe me.

90
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:50,756
Maybe you ought to call your father
and tell him about it.

91
00:17:51,296 --> 00:17:54,136
I can't. He's in Mexico with Sally.

92
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:07,356
Where's Mexico?

93
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,196
Excuse me.

94
00:18:17,276 --> 00:18:19,196
I'm going to kill you.

95
00:18:21,116 --> 00:18:23,866
If you see it again, whatever it is,
don't touch it.

96
00:18:23,956 --> 00:18:27,036
Just call me.
We'll have somebody take it away.

97
00:18:27,496 --> 00:18:29,626
Like the dogcatcher?

98
00:18:29,706 --> 00:18:31,626
They'll give it a lobotomy...

99
00:18:31,716 --> 00:18:34,716
...or do experiments on it or something.

100
00:18:35,506 --> 00:18:37,756
Your turn to do the dishes.

101
00:18:37,926 --> 00:18:40,216
- I set and cleared.
- I did.

102
00:18:40,306 --> 00:18:43,306
I did breakfast.
I did breakfast.

103
00:18:46,476 --> 00:18:48,186
What's the matter, Mom?

104
00:18:51,275 --> 00:18:53,145
He hates Mexico.

105
00:18:53,985 --> 00:18:56,315
Damn it! Why don't you grow up?

106
00:18:56,405 --> 00:18:59,485
Think how other people feel for a change.

107
00:20:11,474 --> 00:20:12,564
Ma...

108
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:13,684
Mom.

109
00:20:13,764 --> 00:20:14,854
Mom.

110
00:20:14,934 --> 00:20:16,144
Michael.

111
00:20:21,814 --> 00:20:22,984
Michael.

112
00:20:23,074 --> 00:20:24,284
Mom.

113
00:23:17,151 --> 00:23:18,451
Wow!

114
00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:42,919
Okay, you're hot.

115
00:25:43,589 --> 00:25:45,129
I'll be back.

116
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,429
Mary, can I back the car out?
Not one foot past the driveway.

117
00:26:50,198 --> 00:26:54,368
You were outside last night
waiting for that thing, weren't you?

118
00:26:55,198 --> 00:26:57,578
Are you going to live if I go to work?

119
00:27:01,747 --> 00:27:02,957
Okay.

120
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:04,627
No TV.

121
00:27:14,137 --> 00:27:15,467
Come on.

122
00:27:15,557 --> 00:27:17,347
Mommy, look what Michael did.

123
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:18,437
This and...

124
00:27:18,517 --> 00:27:21,937
I see them, Gert,
and when I catch him, I'll catch him.

125
00:27:25,607 --> 00:27:27,777
Come on. Don't be afraid.

126
00:27:28,567 --> 00:27:30,777
It's all right. Come on.

127
00:27:32,237 --> 00:27:33,407
Come on.

128
00:27:38,207 --> 00:27:39,617
Come on.

129
00:27:40,997 --> 00:27:42,377
Come on.

130
00:27:42,747 --> 00:27:43,917
Come on.

131
00:27:44,957 --> 00:27:46,207
Come on.

132
00:27:54,467 --> 00:27:56,217
Do you talk?

133
00:27:57,017 --> 00:27:58,557
You know, talk?

134
00:28:00,477 --> 00:28:02,017
Me, human.

135
00:28:02,936 --> 00:28:03,856
Boy.

136
00:28:04,606 --> 00:28:05,856
Elliott.

137
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:09,526
Elliott.

138
00:28:10,896 --> 00:28:12,356
Elliott.

139
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:26,336
Coke. See, we drink it.

140
00:28:26,416 --> 00:28:28,336
It's a drink.

141
00:28:28,586 --> 00:28:30,506
You know, food?

142
00:28:31,466 --> 00:28:33,836
These are toys. Little men.

143
00:28:34,086 --> 00:28:36,216
This is Greedo.

144
00:28:36,296 --> 00:28:39,426
And then this is Hammerhead.

145
00:28:39,766 --> 00:28:42,306
You see, this is Walrus Man.

146
00:28:42,386 --> 00:28:45,646
And then this is Snaggletooth.

147
00:28:46,146 --> 00:28:48,726
And this is Lando Calrissian.

148
00:28:49,106 --> 00:28:50,276
See?

149
00:28:50,986 --> 00:28:53,146
And this is Boba Fett.

150
00:28:53,316 --> 00:28:55,986
Look. They can even have wars.

151
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:03,036
And look. Fish.

152
00:29:03,705 --> 00:29:06,285
The fish eat the fish food...

153
00:29:06,705 --> 00:29:08,995
...and the shark eats the fish...

154
00:29:09,455 --> 00:29:11,585
...but nobody eats a shark.

155
00:29:13,915 --> 00:29:17,335
See, this is Pez. Candy.

156
00:29:17,675 --> 00:29:19,305
You see, you eat it.

157
00:29:19,385 --> 00:29:22,265
You put the candy in here...

158
00:29:22,725 --> 00:29:26,515
...and when you lift the head,
the candy comes out and you can eat it.

159
00:29:26,595 --> 00:29:28,055
You want some?

160
00:29:30,895 --> 00:29:32,735
This is a peanut.

161
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:34,235
You eat it.

162
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:38,025
But you can't eat this one because this is fake.

163
00:29:38,365 --> 00:29:40,575
This is money. You see?

164
00:29:41,235 --> 00:29:43,785
We put the money in the peanut.

165
00:29:43,905 --> 00:29:45,825
You see? Bank.

166
00:29:46,165 --> 00:29:47,325
And then...

167
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:50,875
...this is a car.

168
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:54,005
This is what we get around in.

169
00:29:54,205 --> 00:29:56,125
See? A car.

170
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,425
Wait a second.

171
00:30:02,715 --> 00:30:05,424
No. You don't eat them.

172
00:30:06,014 --> 00:30:07,434
Are you hungry?

173
00:30:08,844 --> 00:30:10,354
I'm hungry.

174
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:15,184
Stay.

175
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,234
Stay.

176
00:30:20,314 --> 00:30:22,324
I'll be right here.

177
00:30:23,034 --> 00:30:26,654
Okay? I'll be right here.

178
00:30:26,744 --> 00:30:27,744
Harv!

179
00:30:33,204 --> 00:30:35,204
Come on, Harvey.

180
00:30:41,964 --> 00:30:43,464
He'll like this.

181
00:30:50,804 --> 00:30:52,014
This.

182
00:30:54,264 --> 00:30:55,184
This.

183
00:31:22,713 --> 00:31:24,253
Are you okay?

184
00:31:27,713 --> 00:31:29,473
Too much excitement?

185
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:31,763
Want a Coke?

186
00:31:37,713 --> 00:31:41,583
"There are so many people to see

187
00:31:42,043 --> 00:31:45,963
"So many people you can check upon
and add to your collection

188
00:31:46,053 --> 00:31:48,883
"But they keep you hanging on

189
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:50,803
"Nothing but health shit

190
00:31:52,393 --> 00:31:56,683
"Add to your collection
but they keep you hanging on"

191
00:32:02,563 --> 00:32:03,823
Mike, come in.

192
00:32:03,903 --> 00:32:06,483
How you feeling, faker?
I'm feeling fine.

193
00:32:06,573 --> 00:32:08,112
I got something really important...

194
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:11,362
Tyler said he got 69,000 on Asteroids yesterday...

195
00:32:11,452 --> 00:32:14,282
...but he pulled the plug.
- Look, remember the goblin?

196
00:32:14,372 --> 00:32:15,872
You're so lame, Elliott.

197
00:32:15,952 --> 00:32:18,082
Come on, Michael. He came back.

198
00:32:18,662 --> 00:32:20,212
He came back?

199
00:32:20,622 --> 00:32:22,542
He came back?

200
00:32:22,632 --> 00:32:24,212
My God!

201
00:32:24,292 --> 00:32:25,462
One thing.

202
00:32:26,842 --> 00:32:28,712
I have absolute power.

203
00:32:29,012 --> 00:32:30,092
Say it.

204
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:33,392
- Say it!
- What have you got? Is it the coyote?

205
00:32:33,472 --> 00:32:35,682
No. Look...

206
00:32:37,262 --> 00:32:40,272
Okay. Now, swear it.

207
00:32:40,352 --> 00:32:43,232
The most excellent promise you can make.

208
00:32:43,312 --> 00:32:46,442
Swear as my only brother on our lives.

209
00:32:46,522 --> 00:32:48,942
Don't get so heavy. I swear.

210
00:32:49,032 --> 00:32:51,572
Okay. Stand over there.

211
00:32:52,662 --> 00:32:54,912
You'd better take off
your shoulder pads.

212
00:32:54,992 --> 00:32:56,282
You might scare him.

213
00:32:56,372 --> 00:32:57,992
And close your eyes.

214
00:32:59,122 --> 00:33:00,502
Don't push it, Elliott.

215
00:33:00,582 --> 00:33:03,622
I'm not coming out there
until your eyes are closed.

216
00:33:03,752 --> 00:33:05,832
Okay. They're closed.

217
00:33:06,382 --> 00:33:08,801
Mom is going to kill you.

218
00:33:10,841 --> 00:33:14,261
Okay. Swear it one more time.

219
00:33:14,391 --> 00:33:17,811
- I have absolute power.
- You have absolute power.

220
00:33:28,611 --> 00:33:32,151
Elliott! Look what I made for you!

221
00:33:41,161 --> 00:33:42,581
Stop!

222
00:33:48,421 --> 00:33:50,001
Kids, I'm home!

223
00:33:50,301 --> 00:33:51,301
Guys?

224
00:33:51,381 --> 00:33:52,761
In the closet, fast.

225
00:33:52,841 --> 00:33:55,091
Anybody up there, kids?

226
00:33:57,551 --> 00:33:58,761
Anybody home?

227
00:33:58,851 --> 00:34:01,101
Hi, honey, how are you feel...

228
00:34:01,851 --> 00:34:03,891
What happened in here?

229
00:34:05,601 --> 00:34:07,151
You mean my room.

230
00:34:08,771 --> 00:34:10,190
This is no room.

231
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,780
This is an accident.

232
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:15,030
I was reorganizing.

233
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,780
I can see that.

234
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,530
Put those shelves back on the wall.

235
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,620
Get the toys off the floor.

236
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,950
Make your bed since you are not using it.

237
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:27,120
You're feeling better, I see.

238
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:30,500
Will you guys watch Gertie for me
while I take a shower?

239
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,050
Absolutely.

240
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,050
'Bye, Mom.

241
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,190
Elliott...

242
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:49,810
I'm keeping him.

243
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,780
What is it?

244
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:57,280
He won't hurt you, Gertie.

245
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,160
He won't hurt you, Gertie.

246
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:02,490
We're not going to hurt you.

247
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:05,750
Is he a boy or a girl?

248
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,410
He's a boy.

249
00:35:10,879 --> 00:35:13,499
Was he wearing any clothes?

250
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:14,879
No.

251
00:35:15,709 --> 00:35:18,719
But, look, you can't tell.

252
00:35:18,799 --> 00:35:20,429
Not even Mom.

253
00:35:20,509 --> 00:35:21,759
Why not?

254
00:35:21,969 --> 00:35:24,969
Because grownups can't see him.

255
00:35:25,929 --> 00:35:28,809
Only little kids can see him.

256
00:35:29,059 --> 00:35:30,689
Give me a break.

257
00:35:31,939 --> 00:35:35,649
Well, do you know what's going
to happen if you do tell?

258
00:35:38,989 --> 00:35:40,739
Do it, Mike. We have to.

259
00:35:40,819 --> 00:35:42,239
No, please!

260
00:35:42,989 --> 00:35:45,199
I'll do anything, please!

261
00:35:45,279 --> 00:35:47,699
Help me! No, please!

262
00:35:47,829 --> 00:35:48,869
Give it!

263
00:35:49,499 --> 00:35:51,289
- Promise?
- Yes.

264
00:35:51,829 --> 00:35:53,379
Do you promise?

265
00:37:03,448 --> 00:37:05,158
What are you doing, Gert?

266
00:37:05,528 --> 00:37:08,238
I'm going to play in Elliott's room.

267
00:37:09,368 --> 00:37:11,498
Okay. Don't let him torture you.

268
00:37:11,578 --> 00:37:13,367
I won't, Mary.

269
00:37:20,127 --> 00:37:21,127
Hello?

270
00:37:22,547 --> 00:37:24,007
Jerry!

271
00:37:29,257 --> 00:37:31,387
Come on, come on. Hurry up.

272
00:37:32,307 --> 00:37:35,017
Don't be pushy, pushy.

273
00:37:38,727 --> 00:37:40,267
A plant for you.

274
00:37:40,977 --> 00:37:43,687
Maybe he's some animal
that wasn't supposed to live.

275
00:37:43,777 --> 00:37:45,487
Like those rabbits we saw that time.

276
00:37:45,567 --> 00:37:47,657
Don't be lame.
Green, orange...

277
00:37:47,737 --> 00:37:49,737
Could be a monkey or an orangutan.

278
00:37:49,817 --> 00:37:51,237
A bald monkey?

279
00:37:51,327 --> 00:37:54,327
Is he a pig? He sure eats like one.

280
00:37:54,867 --> 00:37:56,617
You could make faces.

281
00:37:57,287 --> 00:38:00,207
And make them mean and happy...

282
00:38:00,287 --> 00:38:02,207
...and make them get sharp teeth.

283
00:38:02,297 --> 00:38:04,087
We are here.

284
00:38:04,917 --> 00:38:07,217
We're here.
Use this.

285
00:38:07,297 --> 00:38:09,337
You could make all sorts of things.

286
00:38:09,547 --> 00:38:11,847
Okay. We're here.

287
00:38:12,557 --> 00:38:13,597
We are here.

288
00:38:13,677 --> 00:38:15,426
Where are you from?

289
00:38:28,356 --> 00:38:30,276
I don't like his feet.

290
00:38:30,356 --> 00:38:32,696
They're only feet, you little twerp.

291
00:38:32,776 --> 00:38:35,536
He's trying to tell us something.

292
00:38:44,796 --> 00:38:45,956
Earth.

293
00:38:47,546 --> 00:38:48,916
Home.

294
00:38:49,676 --> 00:38:50,796
Home.

295
00:38:51,716 --> 00:38:52,846
Home.

296
00:39:29,875 --> 00:39:31,465
What's he doing?

297
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:34,385
What's happening?

298
00:39:47,475 --> 00:39:48,775
Elliott.

299
00:39:51,775 --> 00:39:52,985
Oh, no.

300
00:40:06,165 --> 00:40:07,535
Elliott, what is it?

301
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:09,665
I don't know. Something scary.

302
00:40:30,224 --> 00:40:31,144
Got a pulse?

303
00:40:31,224 --> 00:40:32,394
No, boss.

304
00:40:35,484 --> 00:40:38,484
Hold it. We got it right here.

305
00:40:40,784 --> 00:40:41,864
Follow him.

306
00:40:41,944 --> 00:40:42,864
Okay.

307
00:40:44,744 --> 00:40:46,414
You think it's this house?

308
00:41:16,894 --> 00:41:18,483
Did you explain school to him?

309
00:41:18,563 --> 00:41:20,943
How do you explain it
to higher intelligence?

310
00:41:21,023 --> 00:41:23,613
Maybe he's not so smart.
Maybe he's a worker bee...

311
00:41:23,693 --> 00:41:25,863
Who pushes buttons.
He's smart.

312
00:41:25,953 --> 00:41:27,993
I hope we don't wake up on Mars...

313
00:41:28,243 --> 00:41:31,083
...surrounded by millions of little squashy guys.

314
00:41:38,083 --> 00:41:39,253
Hi, Elliott.

315
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:41,673
- Elliott, where's your goblin?
- Shut up.

316
00:41:41,753 --> 00:41:43,173
Did he come back?

317
00:41:43,503 --> 00:41:44,763
Did he?

318
00:41:45,213 --> 00:41:47,133
Yeah, he came back.

319
00:41:47,343 --> 00:41:49,803
But he's not a goblin. He's a spaceman.

320
00:41:51,143 --> 00:41:53,063
As in extraterrestrial.

321
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:56,313
Where's he from? Uranus? Get it? Your anus?

322
00:41:56,433 --> 00:41:59,563
- He doesn't get it.
- Get it? Your anus?

323
00:41:59,653 --> 00:42:01,693
- He doesn't get it.
- You're so immature.

324
00:42:01,773 --> 00:42:03,443
And you're a sine supremus.

325
00:42:03,523 --> 00:42:05,283
- Zero charisma.
- Sine supremus.

326
00:42:05,363 --> 00:42:06,613
Zero charisma.

327
00:42:06,863 --> 00:42:07,953
Shut up, Greg!

328
00:42:08,033 --> 00:42:10,113
Sine supremus.
Zero charisma!

329
00:42:10,363 --> 00:42:11,453
You wimp.

330
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:23,462
Let's go.

331
00:42:27,052 --> 00:42:29,512
Come on. Get in the car. We'll be late.

332
00:43:13,432 --> 00:43:14,392
Okay, boys and girls...

333
00:43:14,472 --> 00:43:17,722
...today we will be doing
the actual frog dissection...

334
00:43:17,812 --> 00:43:19,982
...for which we've been preparing.

335
00:43:20,891 --> 00:43:22,981
And you will find...

336
00:43:23,481 --> 00:43:25,231
...many similarities.

337
00:43:31,611 --> 00:43:33,911
As you get into the dissection...

338
00:43:33,991 --> 00:43:36,371
...you will discover that the anatomy...

339
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:10,571
The scalpel is very sharp.

340
00:44:11,401 --> 00:44:14,491
Use discretion when you are cutting.

341
00:44:14,571 --> 00:44:16,321
There will be very little blood.

342
00:44:16,411 --> 00:44:19,371
There may be a few body fluids.

343
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:14,840
As we get started with the dissection...

344
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:19,970
...remember that the things
you are writing down...

345
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:34,939
Some of the things that you should
look for during the dissection...

346
00:45:35,029 --> 00:45:38,779
...is to locate the heart
and notice that it is still beating.

347
00:45:42,659 --> 00:45:45,539
I'm going to once more emphasize
the similarities...

348
00:45:45,619 --> 00:45:47,999
...of those things which we see...

349
00:45:52,879 --> 00:45:55,459
Similarities with human anatomy.

350
00:45:56,549 --> 00:45:59,299
First of all, here's the heart.

351
00:46:05,259 --> 00:46:10,309
The intestines will be going
through their peristaltic action.

352
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:14,819
X- W-V-U...

353
00:46:15,019 --> 00:46:17,529
...A- F-P.

354
00:46:17,689 --> 00:46:18,989
That is incorrect.

355
00:46:19,069 --> 00:46:21,279
The correct spelling of nuisance...

356
00:46:21,449 --> 00:46:27,368
...is N-U-I-S-A-N-C-E.

357
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,838
They're pulling us up.

358
00:46:41,508 --> 00:46:45,348
Class, these are the cotton balls
with the chloroform.

359
00:46:45,888 --> 00:46:50,098
As soon as I get them all in,
put the lid on right away.

360
00:46:50,978 --> 00:46:52,138
That's it.

361
00:46:53,098 --> 00:46:55,768
That will start them going to sleep.

362
00:46:59,318 --> 00:47:02,608
They won't feel anything. They won't be hurt.

363
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,778
It'll take a little while.

364
00:47:07,278 --> 00:47:10,288
If you don't want to watch them,
you don't have to.

365
00:47:29,807 --> 00:47:31,097
Say hi.

366
00:47:32,227 --> 00:47:33,767
Can you talk?

367
00:47:34,227 --> 00:47:35,807
Can you say hi?

368
00:48:01,047 --> 00:48:02,167
Hello.

369
00:48:02,297 --> 00:48:03,667
Uncle Ralph!

370
00:48:03,837 --> 00:48:06,547
It's Uncle Ralph, long distance from California!

371
00:48:06,927 --> 00:48:09,347
I'll talk fast. This call must be expensive.

372
00:48:09,677 --> 00:48:12,637
No. If I call anytime on Saturday
without an operator...

373
00:48:12,717 --> 00:48:15,177
...it's five minutes for 85 cents plus tax.

374
00:48:15,427 --> 00:48:17,897
If I talk less, I pay less.

375
00:48:17,977 --> 00:48:19,767
Let me talk to that little fella.

376
00:48:19,857 --> 00:48:22,187
Lou, it's Uncle Ralph.

377
00:48:22,267 --> 00:48:24,237
Hello, Uncle Ralph.

378
00:48:44,666 --> 00:48:46,166
Save him.

379
00:48:53,256 --> 00:48:56,516
Run for your life! Back to the river!
Back to the forest!

380
00:48:56,596 --> 00:49:00,146
Run! I want to save you!

381
00:49:00,346 --> 00:49:02,436
Let's get out of here!

382
00:49:04,856 --> 00:49:05,896
Get out!

383
00:49:06,356 --> 00:49:08,356
I got to let him go!

384
00:49:15,446 --> 00:49:17,406
You've got to save him!

385
00:49:42,345 --> 00:49:44,145
Let me handle this!

386
00:49:45,105 --> 00:49:47,685
Let me handle this! I can handle this.

387
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:49,145
Let me get this.

388
00:50:43,074 --> 00:50:45,164
Sanford, what's wrong?

389
00:50:45,744 --> 00:50:48,794
I'm afraid Betsy Sue
isn't going to run tomorrow.

390
00:50:48,994 --> 00:50:51,254
No. Is it anything serious?

391
00:50:51,334 --> 00:50:54,464
Harvey, I'm home. Come here, boy.

392
00:51:05,724 --> 00:51:06,974
Here he is.

393
00:51:07,094 --> 00:51:08,394
Here's who?

394
00:51:08,474 --> 00:51:11,974
The man from the moon,
but I think you've killed him already.

395
00:51:12,064 --> 00:51:15,064
As soon as I unload the stuff, okay?

396
00:51:21,324 --> 00:51:22,694
Bugs.

397
00:51:24,324 --> 00:51:26,494
I want you to meet somebody.

398
00:51:26,744 --> 00:51:28,914
This stuff has gone up so much in one week.

399
00:51:28,994 --> 00:51:30,873
I want you to meet somebody.

400
00:51:30,953 --> 00:51:34,083
When I finish putting this stuff away, okay?

401
00:51:45,673 --> 00:51:48,263
Stupid ragù. I knew it wouldn't come out.

402
00:51:50,263 --> 00:51:51,893
"B."
"B."

403
00:51:51,973 --> 00:51:53,813
What's with this?

404
00:51:56,983 --> 00:51:58,233
Hello.

405
00:51:59,563 --> 00:52:00,983
Yeah, this is she.

406
00:52:01,903 --> 00:52:03,033
"Basket.

407
00:52:03,233 --> 00:52:04,323
"Bandit.

408
00:52:04,403 --> 00:52:05,613
"Ball.

409
00:52:05,693 --> 00:52:08,113
"Basket. Bandit. Ball.

410
00:52:09,033 --> 00:52:10,073
"Bugs.

411
00:52:10,533 --> 00:52:11,703
"Bananas. "

412
00:52:13,083 --> 00:52:14,753
Intoxicated?

413
00:52:19,713 --> 00:52:22,043
You sure you have the right Elliott?

414
00:52:22,173 --> 00:52:23,093
"B."

415
00:52:23,253 --> 00:52:24,213
"B."

416
00:52:24,923 --> 00:52:27,343
- "Biscuits. "
- "B."

417
00:52:28,183 --> 00:52:29,513
But "B" is for boy...

418
00:52:29,593 --> 00:52:30,643
"B."

419
00:52:30,723 --> 00:52:32,642
...with a baseball and bat.

420
00:52:34,472 --> 00:52:36,102
You said "B."

421
00:52:36,222 --> 00:52:37,642
"B."

422
00:52:38,022 --> 00:52:39,352
You said "B."

423
00:52:39,442 --> 00:52:40,602
Good.

424
00:52:41,482 --> 00:52:43,022
"B."

425
00:52:44,152 --> 00:52:45,612
"Good. "

426
00:52:45,942 --> 00:52:48,072
I'll be right down. Thank you.

427
00:52:50,952 --> 00:52:53,162
Gertie, I have to go pick up Elliott.

428
00:52:53,242 --> 00:52:56,082
- Will you be a good girl...
- Mommy, he can talk.

429
00:52:56,452 --> 00:52:59,752
Of course he can. I'll be back. Stay there.

430
00:53:00,332 --> 00:53:02,462
Ladies and gentlemen...

431
00:53:02,542 --> 00:53:04,962
...little Grover here will demonstrate...

432
00:53:05,052 --> 00:53:08,592
...by chinning himself two times.

433
00:53:08,672 --> 00:53:10,302
Two times?
Two times.

434
00:53:10,382 --> 00:53:12,052
Can I start?
Go ahead.

435
00:53:12,302 --> 00:53:13,642
Okay. Here we go.

436
00:53:13,892 --> 00:53:15,012
Phone.

437
00:53:15,642 --> 00:53:16,972
Phone.

438
00:53:17,182 --> 00:53:18,102
Phone.

439
00:53:20,232 --> 00:53:21,942
Phone.

440
00:53:25,272 --> 00:53:27,732
You want to call somebody?

441
00:53:28,822 --> 00:53:31,282
I am not paying for frogs.

442
00:53:31,402 --> 00:53:33,871
Be good. Be good.

443
00:53:35,241 --> 00:53:36,951
Stay here. Stay.

444
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:38,951
Don't tell anybody.

445
00:53:39,041 --> 00:53:40,961
Nobody.

446
00:53:41,711 --> 00:53:43,711
Be good. Be good.

447
00:53:46,131 --> 00:53:47,001
Move.

448
00:53:53,511 --> 00:53:54,471
God!

449
00:53:54,551 --> 00:53:56,431
- Elliott.
- What?

450
00:53:56,761 --> 00:53:57,971
Elliott.

451
00:53:58,431 --> 00:53:59,561
Elliott.

452
00:53:59,721 --> 00:54:03,561
I taught him how to talk. He can talk now.

453
00:54:04,521 --> 00:54:07,481
Look what he brought up here all by himself.

454
00:54:08,021 --> 00:54:10,151
What's he need this stuff for?

455
00:54:10,231 --> 00:54:11,361
Elliott.

456
00:54:12,401 --> 00:54:13,781
E.T. Can you say that?

457
00:54:13,861 --> 00:54:15,571
Can you say E.T?

458
00:54:16,031 --> 00:54:17,451
E.T.

459
00:54:17,781 --> 00:54:19,121
E.T.

460
00:54:20,331 --> 00:54:22,161
E.T.

461
00:54:22,291 --> 00:54:23,461
Be good.

462
00:54:23,541 --> 00:54:25,751
I taught him that, too.

463
00:54:26,081 --> 00:54:27,841
You should give him his dignity.

464
00:54:27,921 --> 00:54:31,171
This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen!

465
00:54:31,841 --> 00:54:33,131
Phone.

466
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:35,930
Phone?

467
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:37,550
He said "phone"?

468
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:39,310
He said "phone"?

469
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:41,270
Can't you understand English?

470
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:42,890
He said "phone. "

471
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:48,190
Home.

472
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,280
You're right. That's E.T.'s home.

473
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:01,740
E. T...

474
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,620
...home, phone.

475
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:11,920
E.T. Phone home.

476
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:15,170
E.T. Phone home.

477
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:19,470
He wants to call somebody.

478
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:28,940
What's all this shit?
E.T. Phone home.

479
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:31,360
Oh, my God, he's talking now.

480
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:33,610
Home.

481
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:36,319
E.T. Phone home?

482
00:55:36,569 --> 00:55:40,069
E.T. Phone home.

483
00:55:43,739 --> 00:55:45,159
And they'll come?

484
00:55:45,249 --> 00:55:46,959
Come.

485
00:55:47,539 --> 00:55:49,459
Home.

486
00:55:50,209 --> 00:55:51,879
Home.

487
00:55:53,249 --> 00:55:55,669
Come on. I promise, Mom.
What book?

488
00:55:55,759 --> 00:55:56,919
Any one you want.

489
00:55:57,009 --> 00:55:58,219
Spiderman...

490
00:55:58,589 --> 00:56:00,429
We'll just smile...

491
00:56:00,509 --> 00:56:03,969
...and try to get through the evening.
That's all I want to do.

492
00:56:04,259 --> 00:56:08,389
We can't ask Cathy to trick-or-treat
in the same sheet she wore last year.

493
00:56:08,729 --> 00:56:11,859
Now I wish I would've listened in science.

494
00:56:12,439 --> 00:56:13,729
Think, Michael.

495
00:56:13,859 --> 00:56:17,279
We should just grab anything
he could make a machine out of.

496
00:56:17,939 --> 00:56:19,819
What would make a radar?

497
00:56:20,239 --> 00:56:22,949
How the hell do I know?
You're the genius here.

498
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:25,489
You have absolute power, remember?

499
00:56:25,789 --> 00:56:28,619
"I found him. He belongs to me. "

500
00:56:41,428 --> 00:56:43,138
You know, Elliott...

501
00:56:44,218 --> 00:56:48,388
...he doesn't look too good anymore.
- Don't say that! We're fine!

502
00:56:49,018 --> 00:56:50,808
What's all this "we" stuff?

503
00:56:51,058 --> 00:56:53,398
You say "we" all the time.

504
00:56:53,518 --> 00:56:56,108
Really, I think he's getting sick.
He's fine.

505
00:56:56,188 --> 00:56:59,148
Okay, okay. Forget I mentioned it.

506
00:56:59,898 --> 00:57:01,488
Grab that Fuzzbuster.

507
00:57:10,578 --> 00:57:12,158
Dad's shirt.

508
00:57:16,288 --> 00:57:19,548
Remember when he used to take us
out to the ball games...

509
00:57:19,628 --> 00:57:23,088
...and take us to the movies,
and we had popcorn fights?

510
00:57:23,928 --> 00:57:26,968
We'll do that again, Elliott.
Sure.

511
00:57:35,648 --> 00:57:37,148
Old Spice.

512
00:57:37,308 --> 00:57:38,687
Sea Breeze.

513
00:57:44,487 --> 00:57:47,907
"Peter says, 'The Redskins were defeated?

514
00:57:48,117 --> 00:57:50,697
"'Wendy and the boys captured by the pirates?

515
00:57:50,787 --> 00:57:53,407
"'I'll rescue her. I'll rescue her. '

516
00:57:53,867 --> 00:57:55,707
"He leaps, first at his dagger...

517
00:57:55,787 --> 00:57:57,957
"... then at his grindstone to sharpen it.

518
00:57:58,037 --> 00:58:01,167
"But Tink rings out a warning cry.

519
00:58:02,207 --> 00:58:04,877
"'Oh, that is just my medicine. '

"She says, 'Poisoned?

521
00:58:07,757 --> 00:58:09,347
"'Who could've poisoned it? '

522
00:58:09,427 --> 00:58:13,887
"'I promised Wendy to take it and I will,
as soon as I have sharpened my dagger. '

523

"Tinkerbell sees its red color...

524
00:58:16,227 --> 00:58:19,017
"... and remembers the red in the pirate's eye...

525

"... nobly swallows the draft...

"... as Peter's hand is reaching for it.

"'Why, Tink, you have drunk my medicine. '

528
00:58:27,737 --> 00:58:30,367
"She flutters strangely about the room...

529
00:58:30,447 --> 00:58:32,997
"... answering him with a very faint tinkle. "

530
00:58:33,077 --> 00:58:35,907
Ouch!

531
00:58:40,166 --> 00:58:42,086
Ouch.

532
00:58:53,716 --> 00:58:56,426
"She says she thinks
she could get well again...

533

"... if children believed in fairies.

534
00:58:58,686 --> 00:59:00,976
"Do you believe? Say quick that you believe. "

535
00:59:01,056 --> 00:59:02,186
I do!

536
00:59:02,266 --> 00:59:04,646
"If you believe, clap your hands.

537
00:59:05,146 --> 00:59:07,776
"Many clap, some don't, a few hiss.

"But Tink is saved. 'Thank you.

00:59:23,456 --> 00:59:25,876
"'And now to rescue Wendy. "'

541
00:59:26,166 --> 00:59:28,626
Can you read it to me again?

542
00:59:31,136 --> 00:59:32,386
"Peter says... "

543
00:59:53,315 --> 00:59:55,235
He's putting it together now.

544
00:59:55,655 --> 00:59:58,495
I told you he was smart.
I'm worried, Elliott.

545
00:59:58,575 --> 01:00:01,865
He could blow up the house.
He knows what he's doing.

546
01:00:01,955 --> 01:00:04,335
Listen to how he's breathing.

547
01:00:04,915 --> 01:00:07,125
It's going to work.

548
01:00:07,205 --> 01:00:09,295
What's he feeling now?

549
01:00:09,625 --> 01:00:11,625
He's feeling everything.

550
01:00:35,115 --> 01:00:37,825
You're going as a ghost. You promised.

551
01:00:37,945 --> 01:00:41,494
I'm only pretending I'm going as a cowgirl.

552
01:00:42,454 --> 01:00:45,534
Okay. Now, you know the plans by heart,
don't you?

553
01:00:45,664 --> 01:00:47,414
Meet you at the lookout.

554
01:00:47,494 --> 01:00:50,044
At the lookout. I'm not stupid, you know.

555
01:00:50,124 --> 01:00:53,794
You won't get four blocks
in this neighborhood dressed like that.

556
01:00:53,874 --> 01:00:56,714
I mean it. You are not going as a terrorist!

557
01:00:56,794 --> 01:00:58,004
All the guys are!

558
01:00:58,094 --> 01:01:00,014
I'm not stupid, you know.

559
01:01:08,564 --> 01:01:09,894
Ready?

560
01:01:09,974 --> 01:01:11,354
Ready.

561
01:01:28,534 --> 01:01:30,834
Wait, Mom. Don't look.
Okay.

562
01:01:37,044 --> 01:01:39,004
Okay, Mom. You can look now.

563
01:01:43,473 --> 01:01:45,343
That's great.

564
01:01:47,263 --> 01:01:48,763
Stay here.

565
01:01:59,313 --> 01:02:00,733
Ouch.

566
01:02:01,363 --> 01:02:03,193
Stop that! No! Don't!

567
01:02:03,283 --> 01:02:04,653
Ouch.

568
01:02:05,403 --> 01:02:07,613
It's a fake knife. It's a fake.

569
01:02:07,703 --> 01:02:09,663
Ouch.
Okay.

570
01:02:15,583 --> 01:02:16,873
All right.

571
01:02:18,753 --> 01:02:20,543
You look great!

572
01:02:20,713 --> 01:02:22,213
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

573
01:02:22,303 --> 01:02:24,013
Thank you.

574
01:02:32,643 --> 01:02:35,483
Be back one hour after sundown. No later.

575
01:02:40,813 --> 01:02:42,073
'Bye.

576
01:02:45,072 --> 01:02:46,952
Gertie, come here. Come on.

577
01:03:09,972 --> 01:03:11,512
Trick or treat?

578
01:03:17,102 --> 01:03:18,642
Trick or treat?

579
01:03:43,542 --> 01:03:45,841
Home. Home.

580
01:03:45,921 --> 01:03:48,761
Home.

581
01:03:53,841 --> 01:03:56,391
Be back one hour after sunset. No later.

582
01:03:56,761 --> 01:03:59,431
I'll try as fast as I can, Mike.

583
01:03:59,521 --> 01:04:01,601
You got to cover me.

584
01:04:05,061 --> 01:04:07,191
Well, come on. Help me.

585
01:04:07,321 --> 01:04:10,781
We'll be waiting for you, Elliott.
So come back for sure.

586
01:04:37,601 --> 01:04:40,391
It's too bumpy. We'll have to walk from here!

587
01:04:40,561 --> 01:04:42,521
E.T!

588
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:56,320
Not so high! Not so high!

589
01:05:35,110 --> 01:05:36,610
Don't crash, please.

590
01:07:01,698 --> 01:07:04,118
I really can't believe you did this.

591
01:07:10,328 --> 01:07:13,538
Your father's going to hear
about this one.

592
01:07:20,338 --> 01:07:21,798
Mexico.

593
01:08:46,277 --> 01:08:48,197
E.T., it's working.

594
01:08:49,777 --> 01:08:51,366
It's working!

595
01:08:51,616 --> 01:08:52,866
Home.

596
01:08:54,116 --> 01:08:55,576
You did it!

597
01:08:56,576 --> 01:08:57,996
It's working!

598
01:08:58,496 --> 01:08:59,916
Home.

599
01:09:01,456 --> 01:09:04,336
E.T., it's working!

600
01:09:48,456 --> 01:09:50,336
We have to go now, E.T.

601
01:09:51,296 --> 01:09:53,005
We're so late already.

602
01:10:00,385 --> 01:10:02,845
We have to go home now, E.T.

603
01:10:09,235 --> 01:10:11,275
You should give them some time.

604
01:10:13,985 --> 01:10:15,695
Ouch.

605
01:10:23,205 --> 01:10:25,035
You could be happy here.

606
01:10:25,165 --> 01:10:27,085
I could take care of you.

607
01:10:27,245 --> 01:10:29,585
I wouldn't let anybody hurt you.

608
01:10:29,665 --> 01:10:31,795
We could grow up together, E.T.

609
01:10:37,635 --> 01:10:39,345
Home.

610
01:10:41,175 --> 01:10:42,935
Home.

611
01:11:16,044 --> 01:11:17,584
Home.

612
01:11:22,964 --> 01:11:24,594
Home.

613
01:11:59,293 --> 01:12:00,593
E.T?

614
01:12:04,133 --> 01:12:05,343
E.T?

615
01:12:12,563 --> 01:12:14,893
How was he dressed when last seen?

616
01:12:15,733 --> 01:12:17,603
He was dressed as a...

617
01:12:18,773 --> 01:12:20,193
...hunchback.

618
01:12:20,733 --> 01:12:22,113
Hunchback.

619
01:12:23,113 --> 01:12:26,033
Is there anything to indicate
that he might have run away?

620
01:12:26,113 --> 01:12:28,663
Any family problems or recent arguments?

621
01:12:32,033 --> 01:12:34,913
My husband and I just separated recently...

622
01:12:35,373 --> 01:12:38,873
...and it hasn't been easy on the children,
but...

623
01:12:39,293 --> 01:12:41,633
My father's in Mexico.

624
01:12:48,093 --> 01:12:50,013
But run away, I...

625
01:12:50,553 --> 01:12:52,433
Where would he have gone?

626
01:12:52,603 --> 01:12:53,853
Elliott.

627
01:12:53,933 --> 01:12:55,723
Oh, Elliott!

628
01:12:57,102 --> 01:12:59,812
Don't ever do this again, Elliott!

629
01:13:02,192 --> 01:13:04,322
Oh, my. You're so hot.

630
01:13:04,982 --> 01:13:07,532
Run up and draw him a bath. Quick, Gert.

631
01:13:08,322 --> 01:13:10,282
Sorry I yelled at you.

632
01:13:13,702 --> 01:13:16,082
Thanks very much for all your trouble.

633
01:13:16,742 --> 01:13:18,502
Is he here?

634
01:13:20,832 --> 01:13:23,462
You've got to find him.
Where is he?

635
01:13:24,382 --> 01:13:26,002
In the forest.

636
01:13:26,672 --> 01:13:28,462
At the bald spot.

637
01:13:29,222 --> 01:13:30,932
You've got to find him.

638
01:14:21,731 --> 01:14:22,931
E.T!

639
01:14:26,651 --> 01:14:27,861
E.T!

640
01:14:30,861 --> 01:14:32,241
E.T!

641
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:12,150
No!

642
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:13,820
No!

643
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:46,680
Mom, would you come with me?

644
01:15:47,230 --> 01:15:48,600
What is it?

645
01:15:48,690 --> 01:15:50,480
Mary, just come with me.

646
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:52,480
Michael, what?

647
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:55,990
- Mom, remember the goblin?
- What are you talking about?

648
01:15:56,070 --> 01:15:58,570
Swear the most excellent promise
you can make.

649
01:15:58,650 --> 01:15:59,989
Michael.

650
01:16:06,619 --> 01:16:08,119
That's terrific.

651
01:16:14,709 --> 01:16:16,209
Mom.

652
01:16:22,089 --> 01:16:23,719
We're sick.

653
01:16:26,139 --> 01:16:28,269
I think we're dying.

654
01:16:31,939 --> 01:16:34,019
Michael.
Mom, it's okay.

655
01:16:35,899 --> 01:16:37,229
Downstairs.

656
01:16:37,569 --> 01:16:39,699
He's not going to hurt you, Mom.

657
01:16:40,359 --> 01:16:41,659
He won't hurt you.

658
01:16:41,739 --> 01:16:43,449
Michael, get her downstairs.

659
01:16:43,529 --> 01:16:45,239
It's the man from the moon.

660
01:16:45,329 --> 01:16:47,329
The man from the moon!

661
01:16:51,249 --> 01:16:53,999
You don't know him! You don't know him!

662
01:16:58,959 --> 01:17:00,968
We can't leave him alone.

663
01:17:39,878 --> 01:17:42,128
This is my home!

664
01:18:30,847 --> 01:18:32,307
Home.

665
01:18:34,267 --> 01:18:35,387
Home.

666
01:19:15,636 --> 01:19:19,556
The Collagen Unit,
report to the Blue Level immediately.

667
01:19:53,466 --> 01:19:55,386
- Does he sleep?
- I don't know.

668
01:19:55,466 --> 01:19:57,516
What's the matter with Elliott?

669
01:19:58,306 --> 01:20:00,886
- Have you noticed any sweating?
- No.

670
01:20:01,436 --> 01:20:04,146
- Has it lost hair?
- He never had any hair.

671
01:20:04,395 --> 01:20:06,225
Are the children all right?

672
01:20:06,315 --> 01:20:08,935
Did it build or write anything?

673
01:20:09,025 --> 01:20:10,525
No.

674
01:20:10,645 --> 01:20:14,195
You say it has the ability
to manipulate its own environment?

675
01:20:15,485 --> 01:20:18,445
He's smart.
He communicates through Elliott.

676
01:20:18,945 --> 01:20:21,285
Elliott thinks its thoughts.

677
01:20:21,365 --> 01:20:24,915
No. Elliott feels his feelings.

678
01:20:32,095 --> 01:20:35,345
Intradermal sample shows
crystalline refractive index.

679
01:20:38,305 --> 01:20:41,295
Skin is crystalline.
Repeat, crystalline.

680
01:20:41,765 --> 01:20:42,735
Run an ultrasound.

681
01:20:42,875 --> 01:20:44,425
Do a test area, damn it.

682
01:20:45,985 --> 01:20:48,955
Run ultrasound...

683
01:20:48,985 --> 01:20:49,965
Chloride isotope.

684
01:20:50,785 --> 01:20:53,305
Nitrates 255 milliequivalent.

685
01:20:59,725 --> 01:21:01,895
You have no right to do this.

686
01:21:04,245 --> 01:21:05,744
You're scaring him.

687
01:21:06,374 --> 01:21:07,624
You're scaring him!

688
01:21:07,634 --> 01:21:09,744
What is it, a heart?

689
01:21:09,774 --> 01:21:11,194
The whole screen's lit up

690
01:21:11,214 --> 01:21:12,624
Do you think he's changing color?

691
01:21:12,894 --> 01:21:15,364
I don't know.
Are there any other changes?

692
01:21:15,384 --> 01:21:18,384
Temperature's dropped from
20 to 17 degrees centigrade.

693
01:21:19,174 --> 01:21:20,804
Leave him alone.

694
01:21:22,384 --> 01:21:26,054
Leave him alone. I can take care of him.

695
01:21:29,514 --> 01:21:30,924
There is no malfunction.

696
01:21:30,984 --> 01:21:32,024
The brain waves are identical.

697
01:21:33,144 --> 01:21:34,724
Both tracings are weakening, I think.

698
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:38,044
He has an EKG tracing.
We must maintain...

699
01:21:38,094 --> 01:21:40,394
We're not even sure he's alive yet.

700
01:21:43,334 --> 01:21:46,114
Make up a saline solution
in the same proportion.

701
01:21:53,004 --> 01:21:54,334
Elliott.

702
01:21:57,134 --> 01:21:59,044
I've been to the forest.

703
01:22:00,094 --> 01:22:01,884
He shouldn't talk now.

704
01:22:02,514 --> 01:22:05,054
Well, he has to talk now, Major.

705
01:22:07,683 --> 01:22:09,553
Elliott, that machine...

706
01:22:09,973 --> 01:22:12,103
...what does it do?

707
01:22:13,603 --> 01:22:15,693
The communicator?

708
01:22:17,353 --> 01:22:19,693
Is it still working?

709
01:22:20,233 --> 01:22:22,233
It's doing something.

710
01:22:23,323 --> 01:22:24,863
What?

711
01:22:25,703 --> 01:22:27,613
I really shouldn't tell.

712
01:22:28,573 --> 01:22:30,573
He came to me.

713
01:22:31,083 --> 01:22:33,083
He came to me.

714
01:22:34,163 --> 01:22:37,003
Elliott, he came to me, too.

715
01:22:38,463 --> 01:22:41,753
I've been wishing for this
since I was 10 years old.

716
01:22:42,553 --> 01:22:44,673
I don't want him to die.

717
01:22:45,383 --> 01:22:48,133
What can we do that we're not already doing?

718
01:22:49,093 --> 01:22:51,803
He needs to go home.

719
01:22:53,513 --> 01:22:55,773
He's calling his people...

720
01:22:57,853 --> 01:23:00,233
...and I don't know where they are.

721
01:23:01,273 --> 01:23:03,403
He needs to go home.

722
01:23:04,443 --> 01:23:08,242
Elliott, I don't think
that he was left here intentionally.

723
01:23:11,322 --> 01:23:14,082
But his being here is a miracle, Elliott.

724
01:23:15,742 --> 01:23:17,582
It's a miracle...

725
01:23:18,622 --> 01:23:21,582
...and you did the best that anybody could do.

726
01:23:24,962 --> 01:23:27,012
I'm glad he met you first.

727
01:23:36,102 --> 01:23:37,272
He's got DNA.

728
01:23:39,152 --> 01:23:41,152
- He's got DNA.
- DNA?

729
01:23:41,292 --> 01:23:43,152
Positive, he's got DNA!

730
01:23:43,342 --> 01:23:45,042
Temperature 20 degrees centigrade.

731
01:23:45,282 --> 01:23:49,222
There's a drop in the creature's blood
pressure down from 100/70 to 84/64.

732
01:23:49,242 --> 01:23:50,242
E.T!

733
01:23:50,322 --> 01:23:53,782
The boy's condition is stabilizing.
Blood pressure's back up.

734
01:23:54,912 --> 01:23:56,702
E.T.

735
01:23:58,042 --> 01:23:59,662
Elliott.

736
01:24:00,372 --> 01:24:02,252
He's speaking.
He's talking.

737
01:24:02,332 --> 01:24:03,922
E.T...

738
01:24:04,582 --> 01:24:06,172
...stay with me.

739
01:24:08,002 --> 01:24:09,261
Please.

740
01:24:09,341 --> 01:24:11,131
Stay.

741
01:24:11,421 --> 01:24:12,761
Together.

742
01:24:14,181 --> 01:24:16,431
I'll be right here.

743
01:24:16,851 --> 01:24:18,851
I'll be right here.

744
01:24:21,561 --> 01:24:23,141
Stay...

745
01:24:24,521 --> 01:24:27,361
...Elliott.

746
01:24:28,901 --> 01:24:30,491
Stay.

747
01:24:32,451 --> 01:24:33,911
Stay.

748
01:24:37,621 --> 01:24:39,081
Stay.

749
01:24:41,201 --> 01:24:42,461
Stay.

750
01:24:42,711 --> 01:24:46,081
The creature's pressure is bottoming out.
His complexes are slow.

751
01:24:46,171 --> 01:24:47,791
How's the boy?

752
01:24:48,461 --> 01:24:51,091
He's converting back to normal sinus rhythm.

753
01:24:52,841 --> 01:24:55,891
They're separating.
Boy and creature are separating.

754
01:24:55,971 --> 01:24:59,511
What does that mean?
Boy's coming back. We're losing E.T.

755
01:24:59,601 --> 01:25:02,481
E.T., answer me, please.

756
01:25:03,891 --> 01:25:05,481
Please.

757
01:25:05,901 --> 01:25:07,191
Just relax.

758
01:26:14,759 --> 01:26:15,879
No!

759
01:26:15,959 --> 01:26:17,509
E.T., don't go!

760
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:20,969
- No blood pressure.
- He's got no pulse or respiration.

761
01:26:22,849 --> 01:26:27,229
We can't get a pulse or blood pressure.
It doesn't look like he's breathing!

762
01:26:30,349 --> 01:26:33,939
Leave him alone! You're killing him!

763
01:26:34,149 --> 01:26:35,729
Leave him alone!

764
01:26:35,819 --> 01:26:37,649
Let's move it!

765
01:26:37,899 --> 01:26:39,949
Get the boy out.

766
01:26:40,109 --> 01:26:43,579
Stop it! You're killing him!
You're killing him!

767
01:26:45,659 --> 01:26:48,579
You're killing him! You're killing him!

768
01:26:49,119 --> 01:26:52,459
You're killing him! He came to me!

769
01:26:52,539 --> 01:26:54,169
Any pulses?

770
01:26:54,749 --> 01:26:56,629
He came to me!

771
01:27:02,089 --> 01:27:03,719
Minimal breath sounds.

772
01:27:04,139 --> 01:27:07,639
Calm down. Calm.

773
01:27:09,309 --> 01:27:12,479
Let's try some bretylium.
Can we have some bretylium?

774
01:27:14,268 --> 01:27:15,818
Getting a pulse?

775
01:27:15,898 --> 01:27:18,398
Compressed air. Compressed air's fine.

776
01:27:24,028 --> 01:27:27,078
His pupils are fixed and dilated.

777
01:27:27,988 --> 01:27:29,868
Defibrillate him.

778
01:27:34,538 --> 01:27:36,918
Everybody, stand clear.
Clear.

779
01:27:36,998 --> 01:27:38,708
We're losing him.

780
01:27:41,468 --> 01:27:42,838
Quiet.

781
01:27:43,338 --> 01:27:45,718
It's still defib.
Okay, let's go.

782
01:27:45,798 --> 01:27:47,348
Let's go. Let's go.

783
01:27:53,898 --> 01:27:55,228
Elliott?

784
01:27:56,978 --> 01:27:58,228
Mom.

785
01:28:12,158 --> 01:28:13,998
Let's continue CPR, please.

786
01:28:29,597 --> 01:28:31,517
Would you people stand back?

787
01:28:36,597 --> 01:28:38,357
Something's happening.

788
01:28:39,107 --> 01:28:41,607
- They're going to die.
- Shut up, Greg.

789
01:28:41,687 --> 01:28:43,607
Something is definitely happening.

790
01:28:43,687 --> 01:28:45,527
Anybody have any ideas?

791
01:28:45,697 --> 01:28:48,447
EKG's flat.
I'm going to call it.

792
01:28:50,787 --> 01:28:53,077
- I think he's dead.
- No. I don't know.

793
01:28:53,157 --> 01:28:55,867
I'm calling it. What time do you have?
15:36.

794
01:28:56,117 --> 01:28:58,287
15 hours, 36 minutes.

795
01:28:58,877 --> 01:29:00,337
Okay.

796
01:29:00,877 --> 01:29:02,587
Let's pack him in ice.

797
01:29:03,757 --> 01:29:05,417
Let's leave.

798
01:30:11,776 --> 01:30:13,826
Is he dead, Mama?

799
01:30:14,276 --> 01:30:16,116
I think so, sweetheart.

800
01:30:16,535 --> 01:30:19,455
Can we wish for him to come back?

801
01:30:20,665 --> 01:30:22,205
Yeah.

802
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:24,165
I wish.

803
01:30:24,915 --> 01:30:26,495
I wish, too.

804
01:30:36,005 --> 01:30:39,225
Come on, Gert.
We'll wait for Elliott in the front room.

805
01:30:41,805 --> 01:30:46,105
Cardiac arrest was terminated
at 1500 hours and 36 minutes.

806
01:30:46,685 --> 01:30:49,065
He received intravenous lidocaine...

807
01:30:49,145 --> 01:30:51,905
...intravenous epinephrine, a lidocaine drip...

808
01:30:52,405 --> 01:30:54,945
...2.7 percent sodium-chloride solution...

809
01:30:55,115 --> 01:30:57,155
...catheters from the "A" line.

810
01:30:58,785 --> 01:31:01,155
The intravenous line should be sent for culture.

811
01:31:01,245 --> 01:31:03,955
He was monitored with a...

812
01:31:04,035 --> 01:31:08,955
...EEG and an EKG, he was defibrillated...

813
01:31:09,045 --> 01:31:11,755
They're going to have to take him away now.

814
01:31:11,835 --> 01:31:14,255
They'll just cut him all up.

815
01:31:16,635 --> 01:31:19,514
Would you like
to spend some time alone with him?

816
01:31:34,854 --> 01:31:38,024
Could we all step out for a minute,
please?

817
01:32:32,243 --> 01:32:34,623
Look at what they've done to you.

818
01:32:37,583 --> 01:32:39,543
I'm so sorry.

819
01:32:44,883 --> 01:32:46,843
You must be dead...

820
01:32:48,973 --> 01:32:50,513
...because...

821
01:32:50,603 --> 01:32:53,433
...I don't know how to feel.

822
01:32:56,893 --> 01:32:59,063
I can't feel anything anymore.

823
01:33:02,403 --> 01:33:04,783
You've gone someplace else now.

824
01:33:13,083 --> 01:33:15,503
I'll believe in you all my life.

825
01:33:17,163 --> 01:33:18,793
Every day.

826
01:33:23,592 --> 01:33:24,882
E.T...

827
01:33:28,382 --> 01:33:29,882
...I love you.

828
01:34:01,622 --> 01:34:03,382
Oh, my God.

829
01:34:09,512 --> 01:34:11,592
E.T. Phone home.

830
01:34:14,012 --> 01:34:15,812
Phone home.

831
01:34:15,892 --> 01:34:17,392
Phone home.

832
01:34:17,472 --> 01:34:19,602
Does this mean they're coming?

833
01:34:19,772 --> 01:34:21,142
Yes.

834
01:34:23,771 --> 01:34:26,821
E.T. Phone home. E.T. Phone home.

835
01:34:27,111 --> 01:34:28,321
Stay.

836
01:34:28,441 --> 01:34:30,191
Shut up.

837
01:34:30,361 --> 01:34:31,361
Phone.

838
01:34:31,451 --> 01:34:33,411
- Phone home.
- Quiet!

839
01:34:33,531 --> 01:34:34,951
Phone! Phone!

840
01:34:35,031 --> 01:34:36,831
Would you shut up?

841
01:34:36,911 --> 01:34:39,201
Phone home. E.T. Phone home.

842
01:34:39,291 --> 01:34:42,041
E.T. Phone home.

843
01:34:43,671 --> 01:34:45,131
Phone home.

844
01:34:45,251 --> 01:34:46,381
Phone home.

845
01:34:46,671 --> 01:34:48,001
Elliott.

846
01:34:49,631 --> 01:34:50,841
Stay.

847
01:34:50,921 --> 01:34:52,341
Stay.

848
01:35:07,151 --> 01:35:10,111
Elliott, why don't you come with me?
No.

849
01:35:11,781 --> 01:35:13,651
No.

850
01:35:17,201 --> 01:35:18,491
It's all right.

851
01:35:19,581 --> 01:35:21,371
Would you like the flowers?

852
01:35:25,750 --> 01:35:28,170
He's alive! He's alive!

853
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:32,210
He's glowing right here.

854
01:35:42,850 --> 01:35:44,810
Are they gone, Mama?

855
01:35:44,940 --> 01:35:47,560
- Who's gone, honey?
- The boys.

856
01:35:47,650 --> 01:35:48,900
What boys?

857
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:52,570
I'm supposed to give you
this note when they're gone.

858
01:35:54,490 --> 01:35:56,280
Give it to me now, Gertie.

859
01:36:03,830 --> 01:36:05,460
Oh, my God.

860
01:36:14,510 --> 01:36:16,420
Give me a hand with this.

861
01:36:24,599 --> 01:36:26,769
- Where's your mask?
- Back here.

862
01:36:26,889 --> 01:36:28,979
Well, get it on!
I'm trying!

863
01:36:36,609 --> 01:36:38,109
Who are you?

864
01:36:38,199 --> 01:36:39,819
I'm driving.

865
01:36:41,449 --> 01:36:43,029
Open the door, son.

866
01:36:43,119 --> 01:36:47,459
- There's a guy out here. What do I do?
- What are you waiting for? Let's go!

867
01:36:48,289 --> 01:36:50,129
Let's get out of here!

868
01:36:50,329 --> 01:36:53,209
I've never driven forward before!

869
01:37:01,849 --> 01:37:05,429
Get the bikes. Meet us at the playground
at the top of the hill.

870
01:37:05,519 --> 01:37:06,639
Let's do it!

871
01:37:07,769 --> 01:37:09,309
Come on, Michael!

872
01:37:26,908 --> 01:37:30,158
We'll all die, and they'll never give me my license.

873
01:37:33,128 --> 01:37:34,588
Where's the playground?

874
01:37:34,668 --> 01:37:36,548
It's near the preschool!

875
01:37:36,798 --> 01:37:39,168
- Where's that?
- I don't know streets.

876
01:37:39,258 --> 01:37:41,258
Mom always drives me.

877
01:37:41,628 --> 01:37:42,968
Son of a bitch.

878
01:38:09,198 --> 01:38:12,538
- Where are you going?
- To the spaceship.

879
01:38:13,078 --> 01:38:16,458
To the spaceship to the moon.

880
01:38:16,538 --> 01:38:18,088
Quiet!

881
01:38:19,378 --> 01:38:20,878
Oh, my God.

882
01:38:21,918 --> 01:38:24,298
Stop the van!

883
01:38:27,427 --> 01:38:29,057
Don't pull them off!

884
01:38:42,317 --> 01:38:43,647
That did it!

885
01:39:32,446 --> 01:39:35,036
Okay. He's a man from outer space...

886
01:39:35,156 --> 01:39:37,536
...and we're taking him to his spaceship.

887
01:39:37,616 --> 01:39:39,956
Well, can't he just beam up?

888
01:39:40,036 --> 01:39:42,086
This is reality, Greg.

889
01:39:43,956 --> 01:39:45,626
Keep her back!
No!

890
01:39:45,716 --> 01:39:49,716
Hold her back!

891
01:39:49,796 --> 01:39:52,556
No!

892
01:39:52,636 --> 01:39:54,096
Where are they?

893
01:39:54,386 --> 01:39:56,096
There's nobody here.

894
01:40:03,686 --> 01:40:05,106
Where are we going?

895
01:40:05,186 --> 01:40:06,736
To the forest!

896
01:40:09,856 --> 01:40:11,196
Follow me!

897
01:40:43,645 --> 01:40:45,565
We got them at the bottom of the hill.

898
01:41:01,665 --> 01:41:03,075
This is Unit 302.

899
01:41:03,165 --> 01:41:05,995
We've cut the kids off at the bottom of the hill.

900
01:41:31,394 --> 01:41:32,814
Let's split up.

901
01:41:33,314 --> 01:41:34,404
Okay!

902
01:41:42,614 --> 01:41:44,204
Hang on!

903
01:42:04,934 --> 01:42:06,514
We made it! Oh, shit!

904
01:42:47,383 --> 01:42:49,393
Tell me when it's over!

905
01:44:02,082 --> 01:44:03,542
Home.

906
01:44:51,471 --> 01:44:53,261
Stop the car, Mama!

907
01:44:53,341 --> 01:44:54,681
They're over there!

908
01:44:54,761 --> 01:44:56,471
They're over there!

909
01:45:12,031 --> 01:45:15,111
I just wanted to say goodbye.

910
01:45:16,781 --> 01:45:18,661
He doesn't know goodbye.

911
01:45:20,991 --> 01:45:23,411
Be good.

912
01:45:24,661 --> 01:45:25,961
Yes.

913
01:45:53,780 --> 01:45:55,320
Thank...

914
01:45:55,700 --> 01:45:57,410
...you.

915
01:45:58,360 --> 01:46:00,120
You're welcome.

916
01:46:26,430 --> 01:46:27,770
Come.

917
01:46:32,190 --> 01:46:33,570
Stay.

918
01:46:44,579 --> 01:46:46,039
Ouch.

919
01:46:52,629 --> 01:46:53,879
Ouch.

920
01:48:05,118 --> 01:48:07,658
I'll be...

921
01:48:07,868 --> 01:48:10,248
...right here.

922
01:48:20,088 --> 01:48:21,298
'Bye.
