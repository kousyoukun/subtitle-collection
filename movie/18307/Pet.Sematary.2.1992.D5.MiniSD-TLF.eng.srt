1
00:02:12,763 --> 00:02:16,381
Cut. Thank you very much, Renee.

2
00:02:16,517 --> 00:02:18,474
I'm sorry. He grabbed me.

3
00:02:23,858 --> 00:02:26,265
I'm sorry. He keeps missing my arms.

4
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:31,481
- Frank, why don't we give this up?
- Frank. I can't see a damn thing.

5
00:02:31,616 --> 00:02:34,071
- OK.
- Sorry, Renee.

6
00:02:35,995 --> 00:02:39,696
Tell me the truth. You get off
on seeing me suffer, don't you?

7
00:02:42,252 --> 00:02:45,336
- OK.
- Water everywhere.

8
00:02:46,131 --> 00:02:47,625
Can I get a cigarette?

9
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:51,964
Guys, we've gotta sort this out. You
think you can hit your mark this time?

10
00:02:52,095 --> 00:02:55,511
It's not a matter of hitting the mark.
There's not a damn thing to see.

11
00:02:55,641 --> 00:02:58,511
OK, look, but I need...

12
00:03:00,563 --> 00:03:02,187
Jeff.

13
00:03:03,691 --> 00:03:05,233
I'm right here, Mom.

14
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,239
- How long have you been here?
- Couple of minutes.

15
00:03:10,865 --> 00:03:13,700
- How was your stay with your father?
- Good.

16
00:03:14,911 --> 00:03:18,909
He wants to come down to the set
for dinner, if it's all right.

17
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,035
I mean...

18
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:25,253
What I'm really tryin' to say
is he misses you.

19
00:03:26,047 --> 00:03:28,669
Dinner would be great.

20
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,920
I just don't want you
gettin' your hopes up, OK?

21
00:03:32,054 --> 00:03:35,138
- We're tryin' to work things out, but...
- I know, Mom.

22
00:03:35,265 --> 00:03:38,765
OK, people, quiet.
Final touches, now's the time.

23
00:03:39,478 --> 00:03:41,435
I think it's showtime.

24
00:03:43,941 --> 00:03:45,566
Jeff?

25
00:03:46,444 --> 00:03:47,523
I love you.

26
00:03:55,078 --> 00:03:58,245
- Roll, please.
- OK, camera rolling.

27
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,704
<i>Castle of Terror, scene 13, take 33.</i>

28
00:04:08,425 --> 00:04:10,418
OK. Action, Renee.

29
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,379
Cut. For Christ's sake, cut!

30
00:04:46,423 --> 00:04:49,673
There's a dead short.
We've lost the neutral.

31
00:04:49,801 --> 00:04:52,293
Cut the power.

32
00:05:00,855 --> 00:05:02,479
Mom!

33
00:05:19,499 --> 00:05:23,579
I know this is hard for you, but
I think you made the right decision.

34
00:05:23,712 --> 00:05:25,669
He was a very old dog.

35
00:05:27,507 --> 00:05:28,788
He had a good life.

36
00:05:28,925 --> 00:05:33,469
Dr Matthews, your son is on line one.
He says it's an emergency.

37
00:05:35,307 --> 00:05:37,549
Can you take? Excuse me.

38
00:05:42,606 --> 00:05:44,646
Jeff, what's goin' on?

39
00:05:54,577 --> 00:05:59,038
I am the resurrection
and the life, sayeth the Lord.

40
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,797
She who believeth in me, though
she were dead, yet she shall live.

41
00:06:08,091 --> 00:06:13,334
Whosoever liveth and
believeth in me shall never die.

42
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:18,216
I know my Redeemer liveth,

43
00:06:18,352 --> 00:06:24,640
and that he shall stand
until the latter day upon the earth.

44
00:06:26,402 --> 00:06:30,151
Friends, let us bow our heads
in silent prayer.

45
00:06:46,548 --> 00:06:49,632
Friends, our service is now concluded.

46
00:06:58,602 --> 00:07:00,678
Here we go.

47
00:07:01,438 --> 00:07:07,109
Come on, folks, keep it back.
Show a little respect, now.

48
00:07:07,486 --> 00:07:11,947
- Excuse me. I know it's a difficult time...
- Obviously you boys didn't hear me.

49
00:07:12,075 --> 00:07:14,316
Show a little respect.

50
00:07:16,538 --> 00:07:20,322
You probably don't remember me,
Chase. I'm Gus Gilbert, town sheriff.

51
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,118
I remember you.

52
00:07:23,336 --> 00:07:28,497
I hear you're movin' in to the summer
house. Do you plan on stayin' full time?

53
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:32,213
Just wanted to get my son,
Jeff, outta LA.

54
00:07:33,055 --> 00:07:35,094
Start things over.

55
00:07:37,059 --> 00:07:40,095
- My deepest regrets.
- Thank you.

56
00:08:14,765 --> 00:08:19,807
We got six of these wardrobe boxes.
You sure you want them all in the attic?

57
00:08:21,355 --> 00:08:26,017
What do you say we give the clothes
to Goodwill? We'll keep the rest.

58
00:08:26,152 --> 00:08:28,524
You're the one who wanted to move.

59
00:08:31,115 --> 00:08:33,737
All the "Renee" boxes in the attic.

60
00:08:33,868 --> 00:08:34,947
All right.

61
00:08:48,925 --> 00:08:53,137
Hi. I'm Marjorie Hargrove,
your new housekeeper.

62
00:08:54,098 --> 00:08:55,722
Hi.

63
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,889
Is something wrong?

64
00:09:04,025 --> 00:09:09,232
No. You just look different than you
sounded on the phone. Please, come in.

65
00:09:12,408 --> 00:09:15,160
I'm real excited to be working
for you, Mr Matthews.

66
00:09:15,286 --> 00:09:17,445
Well, we're glad to have you, Marjorie.

67
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,709
This is my son, Jeff,
and you can call me Chase. OK?

68
00:09:26,548 --> 00:09:30,213
You know, I adored Miss Hallow.

69
00:09:30,344 --> 00:09:33,962
- That one goes in the attic.
- Say what? Look out.

70
00:09:35,891 --> 00:09:37,931
I'll get that.

71
00:09:40,396 --> 00:09:43,065
This is gorgeous.

72
00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:46,057
This is what she wore
at the Emmys, isn't it?

73
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:51,572
Don't touch her stuff. It made her crazy
when people touched her stuff.

74
00:09:53,034 --> 00:09:55,276
I'm sorry.

75
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:57,451
It's OK.

76
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:06,996
Wait up, I'm comin' with.

77
00:10:07,132 --> 00:10:10,216
That's great. I could sure use your help.

78
00:10:17,267 --> 00:10:19,556
Let's go. Come on.

79
00:10:39,124 --> 00:10:41,163
This isn't too bad.

80
00:10:43,503 --> 00:10:45,496
It's pretty bad.

81
00:10:46,923 --> 00:10:49,212
God, how long ago did this guy retire?

82
00:10:49,343 --> 00:10:51,584
It's been a few years.

83
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,760
A few.

84
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:00,096
- Well, what's down there?
- I think the kennels are in the back.

85
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:50,815
- What happened? Are you all right?
- Yeah. I'm all right.

86
00:11:50,948 --> 00:11:53,819
I just got spooked
by a bunch of furballs.

87
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,075
Great. So, now I've
opened up an orphanage, too?

88
00:12:03,003 --> 00:12:06,253
If it's OK, I'd like to take one.

89
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,215
All right, I'll tell you what.

90
00:12:12,346 --> 00:12:16,675
You clean up these old kennels
and she's yours.

91
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:19,099
All right.

92
00:12:21,689 --> 00:12:23,728
Thanks, Dad.

93
00:12:29,363 --> 00:12:31,403
Come on, kitties.

94
00:12:53,055 --> 00:12:55,094
No, Zowie.

95
00:12:58,102 --> 00:13:00,225
Zowie, come back.

96
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,360
Drew, you get a handle on that dog.

97
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:15,239
- Sorry, he gets kinda hyper.
- That's all right.

98
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:18,287
Thought it was lunch.
How are you? You met my boy?

99
00:13:18,415 --> 00:13:20,953
- No.
- Drew, where are your manners?

100
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,952
He's a cool-lookin' dog.
What's his name?

101
00:13:25,088 --> 00:13:26,286
Zowie.

102
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:29,924
What happened, Zowie?

103
00:13:30,093 --> 00:13:33,676
Damn dog stuck his nose in on my
rabbits. They ganged up on him.

104
00:13:33,806 --> 00:13:36,890
I swear that dog is dumber
than lobster bait.

105
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:40,768
- Is he gonna be OK?
- I'm not really set up yet,

106
00:13:40,896 --> 00:13:43,304
but I'll take a quick look.

107
00:13:43,441 --> 00:13:46,525
Come on, Zowie.
It's OK, boy. Up on the table.

108
00:13:47,361 --> 00:13:52,189
Good boy.
Let me look at you here. Let's see.

109
00:13:52,325 --> 00:13:56,192
When I was younger, I thought cats
were the girls and dogs were boys.

110
00:13:56,329 --> 00:14:01,620
Well, there's three more girls where
that one came from lookin' for homes.

111
00:14:01,751 --> 00:14:03,993
Not our home.

112
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,379
Facial lacerations -
they'll heal up pretty quickly.

113
00:14:09,593 --> 00:14:14,670
- I'll give you some antibiotic ointment.
- Drew, you listenin'? It's your dog.

114
00:14:16,141 --> 00:14:20,186
He has corneal abrasions, scratches
on the surface of his right eye.

115
00:14:20,312 --> 00:14:23,100
These eye drops'll help,
but it'll still take time,

116
00:14:23,232 --> 00:14:26,186
so try to keep him away
from those rabbits.

117
00:14:27,194 --> 00:14:28,819
Thanks.

118
00:14:29,655 --> 00:14:34,282
Jeff, did you hear your mother
and I used to be sweethearts?

119
00:14:35,036 --> 00:14:36,661
Really?

120
00:14:37,372 --> 00:14:39,910
Yeah. Prom, homecomin'.

121
00:14:40,542 --> 00:14:42,416
Whole nine yards.

122
00:14:46,256 --> 00:14:48,961
Course, that was a lifetime ago.

123
00:15:19,457 --> 00:15:21,497
Check it out.

124
00:15:23,211 --> 00:15:24,587
Celebrity boy.

125
00:15:30,677 --> 00:15:33,963
You will take your seats
and settle down, please.

126
00:15:41,772 --> 00:15:44,607
- What's Hollywood like?
- Excuse me, at the back?

127
00:15:44,734 --> 00:15:47,189
Would you settle down, please?

128
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,751
What's the hurry, junior?

129
00:16:07,507 --> 00:16:09,547
Where you off to?

130
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,347
Sorry about your mom.

131
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,847
Papers said it was pretty gross,
gettin' fried like that.

132
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,021
Who you got there?

133
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,732
You're supposed to introduce friends.

134
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:31,235
Yeah. What's the cat's name, junior?

135
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,235
Tiger.

136
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:36,447
Don't you think that's
kind of a pussy name?

137
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,157
Can I hold her?

138
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:44,077
Promise I'll be real careful.

139
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:48,505
Jeff, you ever seen a kitten run before?

140
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:52,382
- Yeah.
- No, I mean really run.

141
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:55,094
Like this.

142
00:16:57,893 --> 00:16:59,138
Shit.

143
00:17:54,077 --> 00:17:56,116
You havin' fun yet?

144
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:25,191
- Gimme the cat, all right?
- I would, but there was a little accident.

145
00:18:27,111 --> 00:18:30,860
She was trying to get away,
and her head got caught in the spokes.

146
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:34,027
What's left of her
is back there in the Pet Sematary.

147
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,656
- You heard about the Creed murders?
- You heard about where the dead rise?

148
00:18:38,998 --> 00:18:42,332
Just back there, Jeff.
Just down that path.

149
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:46,790
Come on, Clyde,
just tell him where the cat is.

150
00:18:47,132 --> 00:18:50,797
I told him where the cat is.
Shut up, dickwad.

151
00:18:52,346 --> 00:18:56,426
What are you gonna do, fat ass?
You gonna sic big bad old Gus on me?

152
00:18:59,728 --> 00:19:03,561
What do you think, Jeff? Maybe
you could go dig up your old lady,

153
00:19:03,691 --> 00:19:07,440
bury her back there.
And maybe if you pray real hard,

154
00:19:08,154 --> 00:19:11,108
- maybe she'll come back.
- Yeah, right.

155
00:19:35,933 --> 00:19:37,972
You showed him.

156
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,264
Punk.

157
00:19:41,397 --> 00:19:43,555
You showed him good.

158
00:19:43,691 --> 00:19:45,315
Asshole.

159
00:19:49,113 --> 00:19:51,153
This way, fat boy.

160
00:19:54,535 --> 00:19:56,575
See ya.

161
00:22:11,762 --> 00:22:13,801
There you go.

162
00:22:36,329 --> 00:22:39,034
I've never seen anybody
punch Clyde before.

163
00:22:39,165 --> 00:22:41,372
He pissed me off.

164
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:46,913
Sorry about your mom.
She sure was beautiful.

165
00:22:49,426 --> 00:22:52,213
You never really think
your parents are gonna die.

166
00:22:52,346 --> 00:22:56,178
Sometimes I wish Gus would die.

167
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,978
You shouldn't say that about your dad.

168
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:02,721
Stepdad. Gus is my stepdad.

169
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:10,315
So what was all that stuff
about people coming back to life?

170
00:23:11,115 --> 00:23:14,200
Nothing. It's just an old ghost story.

171
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,828
Let's get outta here.

172
00:23:17,956 --> 00:23:19,995
I agree.

173
00:23:48,654 --> 00:23:50,694
There you go.

174
00:24:01,584 --> 00:24:03,209
Dammit.

175
00:24:14,264 --> 00:24:15,889
Thank you.

176
00:24:20,354 --> 00:24:23,059
- How was school today?
- It sucked.

177
00:24:24,567 --> 00:24:27,402
The first day of school
is always the hardest.

178
00:24:28,404 --> 00:24:30,895
You're not my mother.

179
00:24:31,032 --> 00:24:32,063
Jeff.

180
00:24:38,915 --> 00:24:42,367
Live action resumes at the
Cumberland County Civic Center...

181
00:24:48,925 --> 00:24:52,674
Drew, I don't remember
invitin' Zowie in for dinner.

182
00:24:53,388 --> 00:24:56,923
- Just until he heals up?
- Don't start with me.

183
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:02,519
Hi, beautiful.

184
00:25:25,964 --> 00:25:26,995
Gus...

185
00:25:27,132 --> 00:25:28,757
Hi.

186
00:25:37,935 --> 00:25:39,559
Gus.

187
00:25:40,479 --> 00:25:42,519
Stop it.

188
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:03,331
You're breakin' the law.

189
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:05,501
Turn it off.

190
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:12,094
Your mother spent the last hour
cookin'. Show some appreciation.

191
00:26:12,221 --> 00:26:14,676
Really, Gus, it doesn't bother me.

192
00:26:24,233 --> 00:26:25,858
Attaboy.

193
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:32,863
There you go.

194
00:26:33,993 --> 00:26:36,531
Not that much appreciation.

195
00:26:37,539 --> 00:26:40,208
I thought we were gonna
tone down on your flabby ass.

196
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:43,749
Hey. I'm so sorry
I'm not the stud you are.

197
00:26:45,172 --> 00:26:47,793
OK. Knock it off, guys.

198
00:26:51,887 --> 00:26:53,927
You better watch your mouth, buddy.

199
00:26:54,348 --> 00:26:57,598
I'll take that "hey" and shove it
right back down your throat.

200
00:26:57,726 --> 00:26:59,766
You understand?

201
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,031
- Where's your boyfriend?
- I don't know.

202
00:27:18,123 --> 00:27:19,617
Jeff.

203
00:27:22,002 --> 00:27:24,078
- Jeff.
- What?

204
00:27:26,298 --> 00:27:28,337
You all right?

205
00:27:29,927 --> 00:27:33,426
Do you think Mom and you
would've gotten back together?

206
00:27:48,654 --> 00:27:50,694
I think so.

207
00:27:53,451 --> 00:27:55,907
I still can't believe she's dead.

208
00:28:20,312 --> 00:28:21,937
Goddammit.

209
00:28:27,028 --> 00:28:28,688
Goddamn dog.

210
00:28:29,155 --> 00:28:31,194
That dog is history.

211
00:28:31,574 --> 00:28:33,199
Goddammit.

212
00:28:34,202 --> 00:28:36,241
You hear me, boy?

213
00:28:48,967 --> 00:28:50,675
Goddammit.

214
00:28:52,429 --> 00:28:55,845
- Don't shoot him.
- What, Drew? What did you say?

215
00:29:01,772 --> 00:29:03,979
Gus. What have you done?

216
00:29:04,525 --> 00:29:09,401
Amanda, stop lookin' at me like that.
He's had ample warnin' about that dog.

217
00:29:16,538 --> 00:29:18,162
Zowie?

218
00:30:41,084 --> 00:30:44,785
I was just going by your house.
Where's your bike?

219
00:30:45,464 --> 00:30:47,503
Zowie's dead.

220
00:30:49,426 --> 00:30:51,466
I have to bury him.

221
00:30:52,054 --> 00:30:54,509
I don't wanna go out there alone.

222
00:30:56,642 --> 00:30:58,681
All right.

223
00:31:00,604 --> 00:31:02,644
I'll go get a shovel, OK?

224
00:31:12,325 --> 00:31:14,697
So, where do you wanna bury him?

225
00:31:15,745 --> 00:31:17,987
I'm not gonna bury him here.

226
00:31:18,832 --> 00:31:22,117
- Then why are we here?
- There's a better place.

227
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:28,501
It's back there somewhere,
through the bog.

228
00:31:31,887 --> 00:31:33,927
Come on.

229
00:31:55,411 --> 00:31:57,404
It's supposed to be up there.

230
00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:00,659
- What is?
- The old Indian burial ground.

231
00:32:00,792 --> 00:32:04,457
Drew, come on, it's an old bullshit
story. You said so yourself.

232
00:32:04,963 --> 00:32:07,086
But what if it's not bullshit?

233
00:32:07,215 --> 00:32:11,628
If I bury Zowie there,
and it works, he'll come back.

234
00:32:12,429 --> 00:32:14,386
- Alive.
- Drew, look.

235
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:17,718
I know your dog died, but get a grip.
You're freaking me out.

236
00:32:17,851 --> 00:32:23,392
If there was one chance in a million
it'd work, wouldn't you just wanna try?

237
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:58,970
Look, let's just get this over with, OK?

238
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:09,650
If this doesn't work, you can't
ever tell anyone I did this, OK?

239
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:12,022
You've gotta promise.

240
00:33:13,201 --> 00:33:15,443
Well, you need any help?

241
00:33:16,621 --> 00:33:22,410
You have to bury your own. That's
the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule.

242
00:34:00,792 --> 00:34:03,164
I've never had anyone die before.

243
00:34:05,755 --> 00:34:08,128
But I guess you get over it.

244
00:34:08,258 --> 00:34:10,381
I mean, eventually.

245
00:34:15,974 --> 00:34:17,599
No.

246
00:34:18,227 --> 00:34:20,469
No, you never get over it.

247
00:34:30,448 --> 00:34:33,615
Look, maybe we should get outta here.

248
00:34:35,453 --> 00:34:37,078
Yeah.

249
00:34:41,126 --> 00:34:43,165
So long, Zowie.

250
00:35:34,264 --> 00:35:36,471
Wanna get in?

251
00:35:38,727 --> 00:35:43,188
Your mama's worried sick. Take off in
the night, you don't show up for school.

252
00:35:43,315 --> 00:35:47,100
What are you tryin' to prove?
I'm not trying to prove anything.

253
00:35:47,236 --> 00:35:49,525
I was burying my dog.

254
00:35:51,366 --> 00:35:53,572
Life is full of lessons, buddy.

255
00:35:53,701 --> 00:35:57,616
No one's above 'em. Not you, not me.
Now get in the car.

256
00:36:52,095 --> 00:36:53,720
Zowie?

257
00:37:09,822 --> 00:37:11,862
Drew.

258
00:37:12,116 --> 00:37:14,405
Drew, you unlock this door right now.

259
00:37:14,535 --> 00:37:17,109
- Unlock it, Drew.
- What did I do now?

260
00:37:17,247 --> 00:37:19,916
Open this door, Drew Gilbert.

261
00:37:22,586 --> 00:37:26,251
Where do you come off lyin' like that?
"I'm burying my dog. "

262
00:37:26,381 --> 00:37:30,249
You think a lie like that's
never gonna catch up to you?

263
00:37:32,721 --> 00:37:33,670
Zowie.

264
00:37:51,407 --> 00:37:55,654
You say your goodbyes, mister. Zowie's
goin' outside, and you are grounded.

265
00:37:55,787 --> 00:37:57,329
That's the new law, buddy.

266
00:38:01,543 --> 00:38:04,710
Drew. Honey, I'm gonna call the vet.

267
00:38:14,181 --> 00:38:17,764
Hey, Drew. Jeff,
why don't you give him a hand?

268
00:38:23,607 --> 00:38:26,063
OK. Hey, Zowie.

269
00:38:26,193 --> 00:38:30,026
Let's go up here, pal.
There you go. Lie down.

270
00:38:30,865 --> 00:38:33,403
There you go, boy.

271
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:39,452
- How'd it happen?
- Some psycho got trigger-happy.

272
00:38:43,003 --> 00:38:48,294
All right, I'm gonna give him a local
anaesthetic so I can clean the wound.

273
00:38:48,425 --> 00:38:51,296
I'd like to take him home
tonight for observation.

274
00:38:51,428 --> 00:38:54,844
Can you keep him at your place
until he gets better?

275
00:38:55,974 --> 00:38:57,683
Yeah. Sure.

276
00:39:00,145 --> 00:39:02,019
Come on.

277
00:39:07,904 --> 00:39:11,569
Listen. Maybe he wasn't dead
when we buried him.

278
00:39:11,866 --> 00:39:14,784
He was dead. You know he was.

279
00:39:50,782 --> 00:39:52,821
Jeff.

280
00:39:55,495 --> 00:39:56,526
Mom.

281
00:40:00,041 --> 00:40:02,081
I'm waiting for you.

282
00:40:03,169 --> 00:40:04,249
Mom.

283
00:40:24,817 --> 00:40:26,857
Is he gonna be OK?

284
00:40:27,445 --> 00:40:29,484
I don't know.

285
00:40:29,906 --> 00:40:34,532
It's been three days. His immune
system should've responded by now.

286
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,869
It's OK.

287
00:40:42,085 --> 00:40:44,457
I'm not gettin' a heartbeat.

288
00:40:45,255 --> 00:40:48,007
He must be so weak
it's just not registering.

289
00:40:48,133 --> 00:40:50,671
Jeff, let's take some blood.

290
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:56,930
Yeah, there you go.

291
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,638
Good boy.

292
00:41:01,647 --> 00:41:03,272
OK.

293
00:41:20,917 --> 00:41:23,788
Listen, why doesn't
he have a heartbeat?

294
00:41:25,172 --> 00:41:27,413
Maybe it takes a while.

295
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:04,083
- Happy Halloween, Dr Matthews.
- Guys, take it easy.

296
00:42:09,885 --> 00:42:11,877
- Evening, Gus.
- Evening, Ralph.

297
00:42:12,012 --> 00:42:13,590
- These your girls?
- Sure are.

298
00:42:13,722 --> 00:42:16,011
- Trick or treat.
- Behave yourself.

299
00:42:16,141 --> 00:42:18,929
- Have a good night. Come on, girls.
- Bye.

300
00:42:19,353 --> 00:42:21,927
All right, you go up to
the next one on your own.

301
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:25,479
OK, wait. No. Just hold still.

302
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:33,409
Just make sure you're home by ten.

303
00:42:33,534 --> 00:42:35,907
If Gus finds out I let you go...

304
00:42:38,623 --> 00:42:41,577
I will drink his blood.

305
00:42:45,088 --> 00:42:47,460
Don't worry, Mom. I'll be home.

306
00:43:06,193 --> 00:43:07,985
Where is everybody?

307
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:11,236
Jeff, honey, Mommy's here.

308
00:43:21,751 --> 00:43:25,334
Look at this. Junior here
practically shit his pants.

309
00:43:27,132 --> 00:43:29,967
- Check his shorts.
- Oh, no.

310
00:43:30,886 --> 00:43:32,925
Mommy's here, Jeff.

311
00:43:41,856 --> 00:43:44,525
You gonna run home to Daddy now?

312
00:43:47,528 --> 00:43:49,568
Fuck off.

313
00:43:52,867 --> 00:43:56,153
- What a blast.
- Did you see his face?

314
00:44:15,391 --> 00:44:18,475
- You're home early.
- Just ran outta smokes.

315
00:44:26,527 --> 00:44:28,567
Lucky me.

316
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:32,529
Where's the boy?

317
00:44:33,368 --> 00:44:35,407
In his room.

318
00:44:40,625 --> 00:44:42,250
Drew?

319
00:44:48,467 --> 00:44:51,800
Goddammit, Amanda.
You want me to be father to that boy,

320
00:44:51,929 --> 00:44:56,507
and every time I lay down the law,
you let him break it. Now, where is he?

321
00:44:56,642 --> 00:44:59,098
- I don't know...
- Where is your son?

322
00:45:02,148 --> 00:45:04,686
- Pet Sematary.
- What?

323
00:45:06,402 --> 00:45:07,813
Pet Sematary.

324
00:45:18,498 --> 00:45:23,207
Yeah. That old Louis was one
sick puppy. Diggin' up little Gage.

325
00:45:24,504 --> 00:45:28,205
Maggots pourin' out of
the dead kid's eyes.

326
00:45:28,342 --> 00:45:30,583
Ellie Creed was the only one that lived.

327
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:34,841
Then one night she freaks out.

328
00:45:36,475 --> 00:45:39,180
Hacks up the grandparents with an axe.

329
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:43,270
Police found her lickin'
the brains off the blade.

330
00:45:43,399 --> 00:45:45,688
Threw her in the psycho ward.

331
00:45:45,818 --> 00:45:48,653
All she could say were two words.

332
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:50,856
Pet Sematary.

333
00:45:52,075 --> 00:45:54,198
Here's the best part.

334
00:45:54,327 --> 00:45:56,616
Two nights ago she escapes.

335
00:45:57,330 --> 00:46:00,000
Man, I hope she doesn't show up here.

336
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:03,375
Shit, we wouldn't even recognise her.

337
00:46:03,503 --> 00:46:05,662
Not if she was wearin' a costume.

338
00:46:06,715 --> 00:46:08,957
She could be one of us.

339
00:46:11,553 --> 00:46:14,044
- Oh, my God.
- What?

340
00:46:18,477 --> 00:46:21,893
Shit. It's Drew's dad. It's Gus.

341
00:46:23,691 --> 00:46:25,648
He's gonna kick my ass.

342
00:46:25,776 --> 00:46:28,232
You boys better not be drinkin'.

343
00:46:32,283 --> 00:46:35,533
Drew, get your ass out here,
front and centre.

344
00:46:38,415 --> 00:46:41,581
Thanks for screwin' up
our Halloween, dumb shit.

345
00:46:44,629 --> 00:46:49,291
You little shit. Get outta here, Matthews,
this is between me and my boy.

346
00:46:58,269 --> 00:47:00,308
I warned you, buddy.

347
00:47:01,272 --> 00:47:04,392
You broke the law,
now you have to learn the lesson.

348
00:47:11,074 --> 00:47:12,947
Zowie.

349
00:47:15,745 --> 00:47:17,785
No, Zowie, stop.

350
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:21,367
Drew, call him off.

351
00:47:21,501 --> 00:47:23,126
No, Zowie.

352
00:47:23,253 --> 00:47:24,628
Call your dog.

353
00:47:24,754 --> 00:47:26,831
Drew, call him off.

354
00:47:44,442 --> 00:47:46,481
Is he dead?

355
00:47:58,123 --> 00:48:00,162
Oh, man, Jeff.

356
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,790
We killed him.

357
00:48:03,628 --> 00:48:05,668
Are you sure?

358
00:48:19,019 --> 00:48:20,811
What are we gonna do?

359
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:27,399
We can bring him back.

360
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:31,236
We can, can't we?

361
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,278
It worked on Zowie.

362
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:37,117
All right.

363
00:48:39,457 --> 00:48:41,497
Oh, God.

364
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:34,007
Drew, do you know what time it is?

365
00:49:36,558 --> 00:49:38,635
Did Gus ever find you?

366
00:49:40,521 --> 00:49:42,561
God, what happened to you?

367
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:47,067
Nothin' happened, Mom.
We just ditched Gus, that's all.

368
00:50:02,961 --> 00:50:05,001
You been drinkin'?

369
00:50:07,299 --> 00:50:09,671
Drew's mom called hours ago.

370
00:50:10,761 --> 00:50:14,461
The other kids were back by ten.
Where the hell were you boys?

371
00:50:14,598 --> 00:50:16,638
- Just out.
- Just out?

372
00:50:19,895 --> 00:50:25,270
Hold it. I've been lettin' you get away
with a lot these past few weeks,

373
00:50:25,401 --> 00:50:28,568
but I will not stand for crap like this.

374
00:50:28,696 --> 00:50:33,607
I don't care if it's Halloween, it's
a school night. Don't ever do this again.

375
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:37,946
Dad, listen...

376
00:50:38,081 --> 00:50:41,580
I'm really tired and
I just wanna go to bed.

377
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,998
Go on.

378
00:50:49,134 --> 00:50:52,503
We'll talk about this in the morning.

379
00:50:52,638 --> 00:50:54,677
All right.

380
00:51:34,098 --> 00:51:35,640
Drew.

381
00:51:36,642 --> 00:51:38,681
Drew, buddy.

382
00:51:39,311 --> 00:51:41,351
Lost my keys.

383
00:51:59,332 --> 00:52:00,957
Gus?

384
00:52:13,889 --> 00:52:15,929
Found 'em.

385
00:52:20,771 --> 00:52:22,811
I need a shower.

386
00:53:21,835 --> 00:53:25,453
Honey, I'm sorry about tonight.

387
00:53:28,675 --> 00:53:31,131
Please come to bed.

388
00:53:47,028 --> 00:53:51,690
Cold as ice. You smell bad.
What did you get yourself into?

389
00:53:51,824 --> 00:53:56,451
Oh, my God, Gus, what happened
to the? Gus, stop it.

390
00:53:57,038 --> 00:54:00,324
What are you doing? Stop it. Don't.

391
00:54:00,458 --> 00:54:02,498
Gus. Let go of me.

392
00:54:03,169 --> 00:54:06,124
What's wrong with you, Gus? Stop it.

393
00:54:06,256 --> 00:54:08,296
Let go of me, Gus!

394
00:54:19,728 --> 00:54:21,768
Well?

395
00:54:21,897 --> 00:54:27,484
Picture this. Gus comes down to
breakfast, and he doesn't say a word.

396
00:54:28,738 --> 00:54:35,239
He even kinda smiles, like he forgot he
hates me. And you know what he does?

397
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:38,491
He serves me
an extra helping of pancakes.

398
00:54:39,499 --> 00:54:42,583
I asked him if I was still grounded. "No. "

399
00:54:43,295 --> 00:54:47,838
I asked him if you could stay over
tonight. And he nods.

400
00:54:48,842 --> 00:54:51,464
It's like we're a family.

401
00:54:51,595 --> 00:54:53,635
A real family.

402
00:55:05,276 --> 00:55:07,399
Chase, this is Elliot Rudman.

403
00:55:07,528 --> 00:55:10,732
I've looked over the blood specimen
you sent me on Zowie.

404
00:55:10,865 --> 00:55:12,905
Could you give me a call?

405
00:55:19,541 --> 00:55:22,246
- Are you open?
- Yeah, come on in.

406
00:55:25,797 --> 00:55:27,837
Do you have any kitties left?

407
00:55:28,592 --> 00:55:32,542
Yeah, you can take your pick.
They're back in the boarding area.

408
00:55:32,846 --> 00:55:37,058
- You can go on back, through there.
- OK. You ready? Let's go.

409
00:55:47,653 --> 00:55:50,144
- Hello?
- Rudman, it's Matthews.

410
00:55:52,283 --> 00:55:56,495
Matthews, was it your idea of a joke
to send me blood from a dead animal?

411
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,119
I didn't get that.

412
00:55:59,874 --> 00:56:02,200
I said, next time it might be a good idea

413
00:56:02,335 --> 00:56:05,586
if you take a blood sample
while the animal is still alive.

414
00:56:05,714 --> 00:56:09,083
- Just give me the lymphocyte count.
- It's normal.

415
00:56:09,217 --> 00:56:13,761
There's nothing to indicate that the
animal died from an immune deficiency.

416
00:56:13,889 --> 00:56:18,350
Died? There's some kind of
mix-up here. This dog is alive.

417
00:56:18,686 --> 00:56:22,269
Not this dog. The cells
are completely deteriorated.

418
00:56:22,982 --> 00:56:25,473
- You took over for Yolander, right?
- Yeah, why?

419
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:29,987
Cos the last person that sent me blood
from a dead animal was Yolander.

420
00:56:30,114 --> 00:56:33,281
This is not blood from
a dead animal, Rudman.

421
00:56:43,295 --> 00:56:45,453
- Oh, my God.
- What happened?

422
00:56:45,589 --> 00:56:47,628
- What happened?
- Jesus.

423
00:56:53,722 --> 00:56:55,051
Oh, no.

424
00:57:27,632 --> 00:57:29,839
How's it goin', losers?

425
00:57:32,221 --> 00:57:33,881
Jeff. Drew.

426
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:41,808
- Saved by the bell.
- Dad has to bail him out.

427
00:57:45,401 --> 00:57:48,070
Can I spend the night
at Drew's house tonight?

428
00:57:48,196 --> 00:57:50,319
Yeah, that's fine.

429
00:57:50,448 --> 00:57:54,232
Listen, guys, I got the tests back
on Zowie, and he's not well.

430
00:57:55,745 --> 00:57:58,153
Don't ask me how, but he's gotten out.

431
00:57:58,289 --> 00:58:03,035
So if he finds his way home, I want
you to call me. Whatever hour, OK?

432
00:58:04,296 --> 00:58:06,538
- Sure, Dad.
- Yeah.

433
00:58:06,673 --> 00:58:09,081
OK. See ya.

434
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:31,741
You would be so much more
interesting with blue eyes.

435
00:58:49,718 --> 00:58:53,253
- State your business.
- Dr Yolander, I'm Chase Matthews.

436
00:58:53,388 --> 00:58:56,805
I just took over your offices in Ludlow.

437
00:58:57,309 --> 00:59:00,394
I sent out a blood sample for analysis

438
00:59:00,521 --> 00:59:04,139
and they told me that the blood
was from a dead animal.

439
00:59:04,275 --> 00:59:06,517
You might as well come in.

440
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:16,614
Why are you bothering me with this?
Can't you just let it be?

441
00:59:22,252 --> 00:59:27,412
The pathologist, he said that you had
a similar incident with a cat.

442
00:59:29,718 --> 00:59:32,423
Creed cat, that's right.

443
00:59:33,889 --> 00:59:36,261
Bastard's name was...

444
00:59:36,392 --> 00:59:37,423
Church.

445
00:59:39,895 --> 00:59:41,687
Let me guess.

446
00:59:42,106 --> 00:59:46,649
Your dog's tissue isn't healing,
uh, pupils aren't dilating.

447
00:59:47,278 --> 00:59:49,235
Maybe you can't find a heartbeat.

448
00:59:49,363 --> 00:59:52,946
Exactly. I thought it was
some kind of blood condition.

449
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:57,826
There's no blood condition.

450
00:59:58,998 --> 01:00:01,038
The dog isn't sick.

451
01:00:01,835 --> 01:00:04,124
It's dead.

452
01:00:04,254 --> 01:00:06,923
And so was Creed's cat.

453
01:00:07,632 --> 01:00:09,755
And so was his wife

454
01:00:09,885 --> 01:00:12,802
on the night she was killed
for the second time.

455
01:00:13,096 --> 01:00:15,635
Now, you want some advice, my friend?

456
01:00:15,766 --> 01:00:19,978
You get in your car and you
get the hell out of that town.

457
01:01:39,061 --> 01:01:42,145
Goddammit, Gus. This isn't funny.

458
01:02:59,895 --> 01:03:01,852
- Where's your boyfriend?
- I don't know.

459
01:03:01,981 --> 01:03:05,895
Don't lie to me. I'm gonna
give you one more chance.

460
01:03:06,027 --> 01:03:08,482
- I don't know.
- All right, that's it.

461
01:04:19,436 --> 01:04:21,974
I can come back, Chase.

462
01:05:41,605 --> 01:05:45,817
Do you think everybody that came back
would be like your stepdad?

463
01:05:45,943 --> 01:05:47,983
I don't know.

464
01:05:49,155 --> 01:05:51,611
Maybe it depends on
what you were like.

465
01:05:52,075 --> 01:05:54,233
Before you died.

466
01:06:08,508 --> 01:06:10,715
See you at school Monday?

467
01:06:11,553 --> 01:06:13,593
- Yeah, sure.
- Jeff?

468
01:06:14,807 --> 01:06:17,476
Do you ever think about running away?

469
01:06:18,352 --> 01:06:20,309
All the time.

470
01:06:20,437 --> 01:06:22,477
See ya, man.

471
01:07:13,618 --> 01:07:15,242
Shit.

472
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:27,670
Well, well.

473
01:07:27,799 --> 01:07:29,839
Look who's here.

474
01:07:32,262 --> 01:07:34,635
Have fun, junior. Here we go.

475
01:08:06,465 --> 01:08:08,956
Guess your dad's not here
to save you now, is he?

476
01:08:09,092 --> 01:08:11,418
- I'm not afraid of you.
- Yeah?

477
01:08:12,304 --> 01:08:15,471
You ever see a tyre
take off a nose before?

478
01:08:15,891 --> 01:08:18,845
Neither have I. Might even kill ya.

479
01:08:19,562 --> 01:08:24,022
The wheel might chew right into
your brain. You could visit your mom.

480
01:08:34,744 --> 01:08:36,784
Jesus Christ, Gus.

481
01:08:37,497 --> 01:08:39,537
Go home.

482
01:08:40,959 --> 01:08:42,998
I said go home.

483
01:08:58,477 --> 01:09:00,849
I was just fuckin' with him.

484
01:09:01,063 --> 01:09:05,974
What are you gonna do, give me
a ticket? I mean, shit, Gus. Come on.

485
01:09:06,694 --> 01:09:09,066
You can't lay a finger on me.

486
01:09:24,963 --> 01:09:29,008
- What are you doin', man?
- I'm just fuckin' with ya.

487
01:09:29,134 --> 01:09:30,712
Stop it, man.

488
01:09:43,023 --> 01:09:45,063
Stop it.

489
01:09:49,322 --> 01:09:50,650
Whoops.

490
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:45,792
This is the police.
Come out with your hands up.

491
01:10:53,305 --> 01:10:55,547
No, Zowie. It's me.

492
01:10:59,311 --> 01:11:01,351
Stay back.

493
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:15,072
Forget somethin', Drew, buddy?

494
01:11:37,476 --> 01:11:39,801
Drew, buddy.

495
01:11:42,815 --> 01:11:46,895
You have the right to remain silent
while I smash your head in.

496
01:11:47,028 --> 01:11:52,449
You have the right to an attorney, but
you won't need one cos you'll be dead.

497
01:11:53,284 --> 01:11:56,488
No, Zowie, it's me.
No, Zowie. Get back.

498
01:12:02,252 --> 01:12:04,291
Oh, God.

499
01:12:11,386 --> 01:12:14,340
You understand these rights,
Drew, buddy?

500
01:12:14,932 --> 01:12:17,968
Or are you just too fucking stupid?

501
01:12:26,235 --> 01:12:27,860
Mom.

502
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:40,368
Gus killed Clyde, Mom.
He's trying to kill me.

503
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:43,371
- What are you talking about?
- Let's go.

504
01:12:43,962 --> 01:12:45,705
Oh, shit.

505
01:12:45,881 --> 01:12:48,716
Drew, Daddy's not done.

506
01:12:50,427 --> 01:12:52,883
- Mom.
- What are you saying?

507
01:13:02,064 --> 01:13:05,979
- Gus is dead.
- What are you talking about?

508
01:13:15,411 --> 01:13:17,451
Oh, God.

509
01:13:18,289 --> 01:13:19,914
Oh, no.

510
01:13:46,319 --> 01:13:48,358
Mom, look.

511
01:13:48,946 --> 01:13:52,031
- God, what does he want?
- He wants to kill us.

512
01:14:02,210 --> 01:14:04,167
What do you want?

513
01:14:04,296 --> 01:14:06,335
Gus. Stop it.

514
01:14:17,351 --> 01:14:19,391
Drew, what is he doing?

515
01:14:25,359 --> 01:14:27,186
Bye, Drew, buddy.

516
01:14:29,989 --> 01:14:30,985
Shit.

517
01:15:27,799 --> 01:15:32,758
I'm takin' you up the hill, Clyde, buddy.
That's the way the Indians did it.

518
01:15:44,734 --> 01:15:47,569
In local news, tragedy
has struck the town of Ludlow.

519
01:15:47,695 --> 01:15:50,815
Neighbours paid their respects
to Drew and Amanda Gilbert,

520
01:15:50,948 --> 01:15:53,107
who died in a head-on collision
on Saturday.

521
01:15:53,242 --> 01:15:57,703
They are survived by Gus Gilbert,
who is Sheriff of Kennebago County.

522
01:15:57,831 --> 01:16:01,366
Those poor people.
Did you see Gus at the funeral?

523
01:16:02,627 --> 01:16:04,287
Yeah.

524
01:16:06,214 --> 01:16:08,421
I feel so bad for Jeff.

525
01:16:08,967 --> 01:16:11,007
How's he taking it?

526
01:16:12,846 --> 01:16:14,886
I haven't talked to him.

527
01:16:15,683 --> 01:16:17,806
He's been up in the attic all afternoon.

528
01:16:18,102 --> 01:16:21,352
The disappearance of
a Ludlow youth remains a mystery.

529
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:24,315
Clyde Parker was last seen
on Saturday afternoon.

530
01:16:24,442 --> 01:16:27,277
His motorcycle
was found off Highway 62.

531
01:16:48,008 --> 01:16:49,550
What are you doin'?

532
01:16:49,676 --> 01:16:51,883
Getting things ready for Mom.

533
01:17:01,689 --> 01:17:04,014
Mom is dead, Jeff.

534
01:17:04,150 --> 01:17:06,189
You know that.

535
01:17:09,030 --> 01:17:11,319
She doesn't have to be.

536
01:17:13,409 --> 01:17:15,651
What are you talkin' about?

537
01:17:16,871 --> 01:17:21,498
I can bring her back, the same way
me and Drew brought Zowie back.

538
01:17:21,626 --> 01:17:24,497
What you're sayin' is crazy, Jeff.

539
01:17:24,629 --> 01:17:27,915
- Zowie didn't die.
- He did. We buried him.

540
01:17:28,467 --> 01:17:32,381
There's a place in the woods. If you
bury something there, it comes back.

541
01:17:32,513 --> 01:17:34,838
- Come on.
- We did it on Gus.

542
01:17:35,182 --> 01:17:38,800
- Don't you lie to me.
- Fine. Don't believe me.

543
01:17:38,936 --> 01:17:43,894
Chase, you have a phone call.
It's the caretaker at the cemetery.

544
01:17:58,248 --> 01:18:01,165
- I'll call back.
- He says it's an emergency.

545
01:18:01,293 --> 01:18:03,831
Something about your wife's grave.

546
01:18:09,635 --> 01:18:11,674
We're not finished.

547
01:18:20,521 --> 01:18:22,395
What?

548
01:18:22,523 --> 01:18:24,765
No, I'll be right there.

549
01:18:26,903 --> 01:18:29,191
- What happened?
- I don't know.

550
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:33,443
Can you stay here with Jeff
while I take care of this?

551
01:18:36,454 --> 01:18:38,910
Don't let him leave this house.

552
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,155
OK.

553
01:18:47,924 --> 01:18:50,047
I'm sorry to disturb you, Dr Matthews,

554
01:18:50,177 --> 01:18:52,846
but I thought you'd wanna
come and look for yourself.

555
01:18:52,971 --> 01:18:55,178
It's the damnedest thing.

556
01:18:56,266 --> 01:18:59,470
- Gus did this?
- Yes, he stuck around after the funeral,

557
01:18:59,603 --> 01:19:02,854
told me that he had an order
to exhume your wife.

558
01:19:02,982 --> 01:19:07,525
Now, I didn't think much about it until I
saw him drag the body out of the coffin.

559
01:19:07,945 --> 01:19:10,271
He put your wife in his pick-up,

560
01:19:10,406 --> 01:19:15,033
and then he drove off right through
Amanda and Drew's headstones.

561
01:19:15,161 --> 01:19:19,622
It's the weirdest thing that's happened
since Louis Creed dug up his boy.

562
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:28,790
You bury your own.

563
01:22:02,669 --> 01:22:04,294
Jeff?

564
01:22:29,322 --> 01:22:31,361
Are you OK?

565
01:23:50,448 --> 01:23:52,488
I hate that dog.

566
01:24:08,884 --> 01:24:12,087
You have reached a number
that has been disconnected

567
01:24:12,221 --> 01:24:16,633
or is no longer in service. If you feel
you have reached this number in error,

568
01:24:16,767 --> 01:24:21,513
please check the number and try again,
or ask your operator for assistance.

569
01:24:41,126 --> 01:24:43,332
What are you doing, Gus?

570
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:50,755
Well, I was buildin' a doggy door.

571
01:24:51,470 --> 01:24:54,008
What's goin' on around here, Gus?

572
01:24:56,308 --> 01:24:58,384
Why did you dig up my wife?

573
01:25:00,729 --> 01:25:02,936
Cos I wanted to fuck her.

574
01:25:10,031 --> 01:25:12,070
I hate it when that happens.

575
01:25:17,997 --> 01:25:18,827
No.

576
01:25:18,957 --> 01:25:20,996
Got a permit for this?

577
01:25:25,380 --> 01:25:27,337
I didn't think so.

578
01:25:31,845 --> 01:25:33,885
Let me know if this hurts.

579
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:47,686
No brain, no pain. Think about it.

580
01:26:08,342 --> 01:26:11,011
Remember, Chase, I had Renee first.

581
01:27:35,849 --> 01:27:37,676
Marjorie.

582
01:27:38,352 --> 01:27:40,392
Jeff?

583
01:27:46,277 --> 01:27:49,148
Did you really think
you could be like me?

584
01:28:22,314 --> 01:28:23,429
Mom.

585
01:28:25,026 --> 01:28:27,398
I came back for you, Jeff.

586
01:28:27,695 --> 01:28:30,151
We're going to be together again.

587
01:29:24,504 --> 01:29:26,876
We can try again, Chase.

588
01:29:31,178 --> 01:29:32,921
Oh, my God.

589
01:29:34,556 --> 01:29:36,929
We can make it work this time.

590
01:29:40,479 --> 01:29:42,104
No.

591
01:29:49,739 --> 01:29:52,312
Don't you love me any more, Chase?

592
01:29:52,450 --> 01:29:54,573
You're not Renee.

593
01:29:55,912 --> 01:29:57,952
Renee's dead.

594
01:30:01,876 --> 01:30:04,000
Get away from her, Jeff.

595
01:30:07,924 --> 01:30:09,964
Get away.

596
01:30:11,803 --> 01:30:14,888
Jeff, honey,
why don't you go downstairs?

597
01:30:17,518 --> 01:30:19,760
Your father and I need to talk.

598
01:30:30,072 --> 01:30:31,697
Jeff.

599
01:30:34,035 --> 01:30:36,075
I love you.

600
01:30:37,539 --> 01:30:39,578
I love you more.

601
01:30:48,675 --> 01:30:50,584
- Hey, junior.
- Shit.

602
01:30:50,719 --> 01:30:52,961
Wanna play?

603
01:31:05,192 --> 01:31:07,232
Looks like Daddy got a boo-boo.

604
01:31:11,491 --> 01:31:13,733
Now, where were we?

605
01:32:07,424 --> 01:32:11,338
Here it comes, buddy.
Here it fucking comes.

606
01:32:23,441 --> 01:32:26,810
You're gonna die, junior.

607
01:32:32,408 --> 01:32:34,401
Eat this, asshole.

608
01:33:00,813 --> 01:33:03,019
- Come on, Dad.
- Get out.

609
01:33:06,068 --> 01:33:08,108
I'm gonna get you outta here, Dad.

610
01:33:08,237 --> 01:33:10,064
Come here.

611
01:33:26,465 --> 01:33:28,504
I'm melting.

612
01:33:35,265 --> 01:33:38,848
Jeff, honey, what are you doing?

613
01:33:40,396 --> 01:33:41,392
No.

614
01:33:43,274 --> 01:33:45,397
You're not gonna leave me, Jeff.

615
01:33:48,779 --> 01:33:53,240
Your father and I are
trying to work things out.

616
01:33:56,329 --> 01:34:00,872
Jeff, I don't wanna be alone.

617
01:34:04,921 --> 01:34:07,459
Come back, Jeff.

618
01:34:09,927 --> 01:34:11,551
I love you.

619
01:34:12,387 --> 01:34:16,220
She's not your mom, Jeff. Let's go.

620
01:34:18,727 --> 01:34:20,767
Stay with me.

621
01:34:21,564 --> 01:34:23,272
Dead is better.

622
01:34:30,490 --> 01:34:33,194
Stay with me.

623
01:35:10,239 --> 01:35:12,279
You all set?

624
01:35:13,034 --> 01:35:15,074
Let's go.

625
01:35:42,106 --> 01:35:44,644
I never had anyone die before.

626
01:35:45,651 --> 01:35:47,940
But I guess you get over it.

627
01:35:48,070 --> 01:35:50,110
I mean, eventually.

628
01:35:51,657 --> 01:35:53,781
You never get over it.
