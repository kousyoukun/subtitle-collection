3
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,516
But we need four to play.

4
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,684
But I don't feel
like playing anymore.

5
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,478
Why aren't you playing, Robbie?

6
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:39,239
Look! There's something
floating out there.

7
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,570
Oh, goody-goody!
Let's throw stones at it!

8
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,550
This is more
fun that playing ball.

9
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,849
What do you suppose it is?

10
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,351
I bet my aim's better than yours.

11
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,081
I got the best aim in my class.

12
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:49,937
But you're littler than we are.

13
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:50,961
I wanna try too!

14
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,374
Hey, mister, look at that!

15
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:53,878
Fish it out! - It's a huge fish.

16
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,174
It sure is!

17
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,799
That's a funny-looking fish.

18
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,199
- A dead man.
- It's a dead man.

19
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:07,361
Wait here.

20
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,820
Ow! Why don't you watch
where you're going?

21
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,322
Sorry, governor.

22
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,983
No harm. Go along.

23
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,876
Did Mr. Holmes tell you when
he'd be coming back, doctor?

24
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,277
Well, I expect he'll be back

25
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,837
about nine o'clock, Mrs. Hudson.

26
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,504
It's just striking nine now, Dr. Watson.

27
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,469
I've a beautiful roast beef in the oven

28
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:52,974
and I don't want it to burn.

29
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,255
Well, I'm sure it'll be delicious

30
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,475
whatever time you have it, Mrs. Hudson.

31
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,311
I'm worried about Mr. Holmes.

32
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,290
I fear he is gravely
neglecting his health.

33
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,019
Yes, oh, I quite agree.

34
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:07,485
He keeps working so very hard
and he eats next to nothing.

35
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,775
Maybe it would be wise
for him to see a doctor.

36
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,597
Oh, I think he's had enough of doctors

37
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,202
with me as his fellow lodger.

38
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,910
A doctor like you deserves
more obedient patients.

39
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,687
A housekeeper like you, Mrs. Hudson,

40
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,747
deserves masters who can
appreciate her cooking.

41
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,966
Fortunately, sir, you
appreciate it, don't you?

42
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,257
I certainly do, if that's
any consolation to you.

43
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,875
Help! Help!

44
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,180
What was that?

45
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,390
Help!

46
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,474
Help!

47
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,535
- Oh, my goodness.
- Give me a hand.

48
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,839
Oh, but, Mr. Holmes has orders

49
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,934
that nobody should come in
the house in his absence.

50
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:19,769
I can't help that. Get some water.

51
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,064
Now, now, where's my bag?

52
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,360
It's down in your car.

53
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,569
Oh, so it is.

54
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:50,921
Where is he?

55
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,758
In the bathroom in the bedroom.

56
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,325
Good evening, Watson.

57
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:14,281
Holmes!

58
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:18,115
Oh. Oh, you scared me half
out of my wits, Mr. Holmes.

59
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:19,855
I thought I made it entirely clear

60
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,165
that under no circumstances
whatsoever was anybody

61
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,826
to be allowed in here without
my expressed permission.

62
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,565
But you looked as though you were dying.

63
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,126
There'll be no exceptions made, Watson.

64
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:30,836
Oh, good heavens, my roast!

65
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:37,677
Now where's the shipping column?

66
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:38,976
Shipping column?

67
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,547
- Mm-hm.
- Now what are you doing?

68
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,681
I'm looking for the liner movements.

69
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,562
The liner movements?

70
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:45,858
Huh.

71
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,140
Ah, here we are.

72
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,769
Thaysia. Just docked.

73
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,108
Karachi, Suez, benghazi.

74
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:54,989
What comes from benghazi, Watson?

75
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,360
Arabs.

76
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,199
There were no arabs on board.

77
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,498
Oh.

78
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,283
A new case, Holmes?

79
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,905
An old friend of ours has
been going to the docks recently

80
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,288
and waiting about for all the
ships coming from benghazi.

81
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,710
Oh. An old friend?

82
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,010
Who?

83
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,300
Moriarty.

84
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,336
And I intend to find out why.

85
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,300
But, Holmes, we all know

86
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,307
that moriarty is the greatest
criminal in the country.

87
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,468
Why don't the police
do something about him?

88
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,082
Take care, Watson,
if it should ever come

89
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,876
to the professor's ear that
you called him a criminal,

90
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,794
you may very well find
yourself sued for slander.

91
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:29,352
Oh, but we know-

92
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,859
- knowing and proving something are two

93
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,988
very different matters, Watson,
as I need hardly remind you.

94
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,898
It's my duty to bring him to justice.

95
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,783
But how do you propose to do that?

96
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,767
With the help of the times.

97
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,151
Everything I could possibly
require to know is in the times.

98
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:45,827
It is the best informed

99
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,767
and most reliable newspaper in the world.

100
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:48,417
Oh, yes.

101
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:49,873
The most reliable.

102
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:53,006
Now, Watson, what is
the purpose of the times?

103
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,461
Why, to supply information.

104
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,719
Exactly.

105
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,012
Also, to advertise.

106
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,783
That's why the advertisements
are on the front page.

107
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,727
None of this nonsense
about sensational headlines

108
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,007
to whet the readers' appetites.

109
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,579
And then after the advertisements,

110
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,123
what is the next most important thing?

111
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,435
Oh, the sports page.

112
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,558
Brilliant, Watson.

113
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:13,318
The weather, the arts,
the news, shipping news,

114
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:17,105
and finally, yes, finally, politics.

115
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,324
The times is also the least obvious

116
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,407
and most efficient weapon that
a man could possibly have.

117
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,367
Now, pick up that dagger.

118
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,700
- The dagger?
- Yes, go on, pick it up.

119
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,962
All right, and now
what am I supposed to do?

120
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,714
Try and hit me.

121
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,009
Hit you?

122
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,446
Holmes, you feeling yourself today?

123
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,323
Oh, come along, Watson,
there's nothing to worry about.

124
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,632
You won't hurt me. Come along.

125
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,423
No, I can't, really, really.

126
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,406
Very well, then. Try it from over there.

127
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,976
Now, here. Come on!

128
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,682
Nothing to worry about, old man.

129
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,522
No, I'll tear your
dressing gown, you know.

130
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,275
Watson, for the last time, here.

131
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:55,151
En garde.

132
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,606
All right, if you insist.

133
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,077
Help!

134
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,781
Don't move, Watson.

135
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,923
Help me.

136
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,890
You'd better keep the
dinner warm, Mrs. Hudson.

137
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,731
Watson, get the morphine. Quick.

138
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,764
Mrs. Hudson, be good enough
to telephone Scotland yard

139
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:46,322
as quickly as you can.

140
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:47,623
Ask for inspector Cooper

141
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,101
and tell him I want him here immediately.

142
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,240
Of course, Mr. Holmes.

143
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,501
Immediately.

144
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,287
Jenkins, who did this?

145
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:57,591
Who did this to you?

146
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,508
Hair.

147
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:02,804
Hair?

148
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,687
This time, you're
going too far, Mr. Holmes.

149
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,523
How am I going too far, inspector?

150
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,509
I find a man stabbed to
death on my doorstep,

151
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:04,885
so quite naturally I sent for you.

152
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,696
Oh, we know all about this Jenkins.

153
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,828
He's served at least
12 sentences in prison.

154
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,206
I have no sympathy with informers.

155
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,646
He may not have been a
particularly respectable member

156
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,730
of the community, inspector,

157
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,290
but he was of considerable help to us.

158
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,589
And I trusted him.

159
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:21,331
Indeed. I'm sure you did, Holmes.

160
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,154
But what's particularly interesting is

161
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,010
that your private investigation
has now been fatal to him.

162
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,574
That's a very serious accusation.

163
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,318
Are you by any chance
proposing to arrest me

164
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:30,552
on a charge of murder?

165
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,121
Scotland yard has often
requested your help,

166
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,306
as you know, Mr. Holmes,
however, this time,

167
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:35,811
no request has been made.

168
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,143
Under no circumstances can we sanction

169
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,003
your undertaking private investigations

170
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,269
without having received
official authorization.

171
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,412
I'm not employed by
Scotland yard, inspector,

172
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,817
I'm a private citizen.

173
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,219
I do what I believe to be right,

174
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,323
and I'm prepared to accept
all responsibility for it.

175
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,819
This country has a police force

176
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:53,283
and a legal system for
its citizens' protection,

177
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,183
and nobody has the right to take the law

178
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:56,498
into his own hands, Holmes.

179
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,357
L, on the other hand, do my very best

180
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,734
to prevent it before it takes place.

181
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:04,420
Hm. You just proved how capable you are.

182
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:05,904
We're fighting a war with moriarty,

183
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,088
and I propose to continue it,

184
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,303
with or without the
sanction of Scotland yard.

185
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,679
We would be more than
pleased to cooperate, Holmes,

186
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,804
if you would only inform
us of your activities.

187
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,468
That's precisely what I'm doing.

188
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,637
Professor moriarty must
be brought to justice.

189
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,561
Here we go again, Holmes, huh?

190
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,420
You know, the last time you lectured me

191
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,811
about that professor of yours,

192
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,651
I finally decided I ought
to pay him a personal visit.

193
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,611
We had a most interesting conversation.

194
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:31,447
About his criminal activities?

195
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:33,737
No. About archeology.

196
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,156
Uh-huh, so you're an archeologist too?

197
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,139
Mm, I confess I didn't
understand a word,

198
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:40,016
but the professor's an excellent lecturer.

199
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,498
Have you been in his house?

200
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:42,332
Yes.

201
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:43,166
It's extraordinary.

202
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:44,626
Magnificent things in it.

203
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,286
Do you ever stop to ask yourself

204
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:47,404
how he can afford all that,

205
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,840
on the salary of a university professor?

206
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,004
Mm, he comes from a wealthy family.

207
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,637
The professor's brother
is a station master

208
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:56,642
in the west country.

209
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:58,178
When he himself came to London,

210
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,875
he didn't have a penny in his pocket,

211
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,766
and yet he manages to spend
at least 10,000 pounds a year.

212
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,869
Where do you suppose it
comes from, inspector?

213
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,063
From forgery, robbery, and burglary?

214
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,277
And murder. And I intend to prove it.

215
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,863
I think it might interest you to learn

216
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,646
that professor moriarty happens to be

217
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,958
on the list this year
of those to be knighted.

218
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:25,584
Would you accuse sir James
moriarty of murder, Mr. Holmes?

219
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,945
It would give me the very
greatest pleasure, inspector,

220
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,379
to see the knight hanged.

221
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,463
Take my warning, Holmes,

222
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,884
you do not stand for the law, we do.

223
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,027
You're welcome to do
so, inspector. Good day.

224
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,314
Good day.

225
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,647
Cooper isn't really a
bad detective, Watson,

226
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,065
just lacks imagination.

227
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,928
Why do you suppose Jenkins was killed

228
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,443
while he was coming here?

229
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,142
He was bringing me some information.

230
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,296
It must have been pretty
important information

231
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,750
if somebody was prepared
to kill him over it.

232
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,045
It was.

233
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,796
He tried to tell me
something before he died.

234
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,092
Ah, yes.

235
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,426
His last word was "hair," wasn't it?

236
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:13,722
Yes, it was.

237
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:17,849
And then he did something
strange with his hands.

238
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,980
I've got it.

239
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,479
Watson, come around here.

240
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,023
Pick up the lamp, turn it round

241
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,435
so that the light shines on my hands.

242
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:29,738
That's it.

243
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:30,822
Now look at the wall.

244
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,195
Look at the shadow.

245
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,777
What's that make you think of?

246
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,484
- A bird.
- Go on.

247
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:37,787
What kind of a bird?

248
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,238
- Well, a pretty large bird.
- You're getting warm.

249
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,621
- An eagle?
- That's it.

250
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:42,918
A hare and an eagle.

251
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:44,211
A hare and an eagle.

252
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,961
And what does that remind you of, Watson?

253
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:47,961
A public house.

254
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,318
Brilliant, my dear fellow.

255
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,752
Positively brilliant.

256
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,261
George, when
does your ship leave again?

257
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,644
Let's sit here, Watson.

258
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,089
What are we supposed to
do now that we're here?

259
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,899
Patience, Watson. Patience.

260
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,199
Well, I suppose we can
have a drink or something.

261
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:16,406
Oh, yes. Very well.

262
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,702
Yes, gentlemen?

263
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,326
Two half pints of bitter, please.

264
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,907
Well, I wonder why Jenkins sent us here.

265
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,247
That's what we're here
to find out, my boy.

266
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,458
Strange atmosphere in
this place, you know?

267
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,215
- Mm.
- Two half pints of bitter.

268
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:38,221
Now those men over there,
those sailors from the thaysia,

269
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:39,596
if I remember correctly,

270
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,508
our professor is more than
interested in the thaysia.

271
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,473
Oh, you mean the ship from benghazi.

272
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:45,772
Precisely.

273
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:54,103
Which room are they in?

274
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:55,487
Number four.

275
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,368
You stay here, Watson.

276
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:02,278
Wait a minute.

277
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:03,582
I say.

278
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:10,410
Well, then he said he had
to bring his mother along too.

279
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,464
And after all...

280
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:19,879
Well, hello there, sweetheart.

281
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:21,933
Hello.

282
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:23,428
How about a little drink?

283
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,060
- Do I know you?
- No, handsome, not yet,

284
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,766
but we can fix that in a hurry.

285
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,067
Yes, I'm quite sure.

286
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,111
What'll you drink?

287
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,317
I'm partial to champagne.

288
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,070
It puts me in the mood.

289
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,026
You have what you wish.

290
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:39,486
Yes, order anything you wish.

291
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,359
You know, handsome, you're a real gent.

292
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,950
I absolutely adore men who are
shy, especially at your age.

293
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,864
Oh, I'm a married man.

294
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:47,702
Oh?

295
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:50,744
All of the real men are
already married, deary,

296
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:52,833
the ones who aren't are always the ones

297
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,747
that nobody wants around.

298
00:18:58,179 --> 00:18:59,385
Champagne.

299
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,680
Champagne.

300
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,441
And you always drink champagne?

301
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,434
My mother started giving
it to me in my bottle.

302
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,498
Oh, your mother must have
been a very lively lady.

303
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,754
I feel like confiding in you.

304
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,085
Hmm?

305
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:38,625
My mother's in the hospital.

306
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:39,587
Aww.

307
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:40,592
They tell me she needs

308
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,424
an operation.

309
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:43,883
Maybe you can help me?

310
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,577
- Certainly, I could.
- You really mean it?

311
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,601
- Of course.
- Oh.

312
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:47,516
I'm a doctor.

313
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,018
- Oh.
- I'll operate on her,

314
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:49,847
for nothing.

315
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,637
And I'll cut you up too, if you like.

316
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,148
My goodness, you're a doctor.

317
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,268
What are you doing in here?

318
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,571
- Me?
- Mm-hm.

319
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,355
I am a spy.

320
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:04,196
I watch people and I follow people.

321
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,360
And I listen at keyholes.

322
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:08,832
Shh.

323
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,686
Come along, Watson. Come along.

324
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,790
Oh, hello.

325
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:13,201
I was just...

326
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,039
Where are we going?

327
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,204
We're going to listen at a chimney.

328
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:18,508
What did you say?

329
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,423
We're going to listen at a chimney.

330
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,720
Quite logical, surely?

331
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,507
Oh, yes, yes. Yes, of course.

332
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,137
We're going to listen at a chimney.

333
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:30,437
Shh.

334
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,680
I hope you're satisfied
with your room, Samuels.

335
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,184
Yes, it's quite comfortable.

336
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,108
In comparison to the one I spent

337
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,315
the last six years in, that is.

338
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,195
I've been waiting for you for a week.

339
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,698
If I'd had my way, I would
have come back to London

340
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:46,575
over six years ago, professor.

341
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,613
It's no fun being cooped
up in prison in Egypt.

342
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:50,915
It was pure misery.

343
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,744
They were six long years.

344
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,646
From morning till night,
they keep you working

345
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,377
on road construction,
in the sweltering heat.

346
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,088
Where is Harrison?

347
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,384
Dead, professor.

348
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,594
Ah, but wasn't he on the thaysia?

349
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,890
Naturally.

350
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,173
One evening, he tried
to push me overboard,

351
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:13,265
but he slipped on the deck
and fell overboard himself.

352
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:15,364
You must have given
him a little assistance?

353
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:16,931
Yes, of course.

354
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,316
After all, I was only defending myself.

355
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:20,647
It was my life or his.

356
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:22,989
He's no loss.

357
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,610
Let the fish have him.

358
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,160
Well, well, poor old Harrison.

359
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,456
Mm.

360
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:37,494
Samuels, I've located
the man we're looking for.

361
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,037
The man we're looking for?!

362
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,340
Where is he?!

363
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,424
Now just one moment.

364
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,215
First, we have things to discuss.

365
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,892
Oh, George, stop.

366
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:03,732
Oh, no, no.

367
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,817
It's supposed to, sweetheart.

368
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,344
- Oh, I say.
- Don't you think you're being

369
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:10,110
just a little unreasonable, professor?

370
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,473
Without me,
the deal wouldn't exist.

371
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,613
I wouldn't
be too sure about that.

372
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,872
Besides, I'm going to
do all the dirty work.

373
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,896
I have worked
out all the details.

374
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,126
It will be a very simple job.

375
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,690
It may be a simple job,

376
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,500
but only I can do it, professor!

377
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,402
Those are my terms, Samuels.

378
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:25,426
Take them or leave them.

379
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:26,876
60% for you.

380
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,886
Not bad, professor, when you consider

381
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,982
what the Cleopatra
necklace is going to bring.

382
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:33,870
I think you're
forgetting what it cost me

383
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:36,351
to arrange for your release
from that chain gang.

384
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:39,104
The price I've paid
were those six years.

385
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,480
I suppose I have no choice.

386
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:41,978
All right, what are the plans?

387
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,510
We must get rid of blackburn first

388
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:45,732
and then you do your job.

389
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,903
Have you any idea what you're asking?

390
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,533
Where is blackburn?

391
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:53,319
In a house outside of London.

392
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:55,530
It's not far from-

393
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,990
- oh... shh.

394
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:03,625
Shh!

395
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,180
Shh.

396
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:40,937
All right, Watson, you
had your little joke.

397
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:41,961
Now come along.

398
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,341
There was somebody listening.

399
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:50,637
The police?

400
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:52,388
I doubt it.

401
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,389
Well, Holmes, never take a clumsy,

402
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,141
old doctor along with you.

403
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,599
I got all the information
I require, Watson.

404
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:03,480
Blackburn, thaysia.

405
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,767
Well, up to now,
there's been one murder.

406
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,276
No, two.

407
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,424
One of the sailors on board the
thaysia was stabbed to death

408
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,448
and thrown overboard.

409
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:11,989
How do you know that?

410
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,320
Don't you ever read the times, Watson?

411
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,860
I've often advised you to do so

412
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:17,244
when you want to know anything.

413
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,447
Moriarty was after a man named blackburn

414
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,537
who lives in the country.

415
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,167
He sent for two men from Africa,

416
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,203
and one of them killed the other one.

417
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:30,045
The question is, what is he after?

418
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:32,551
Well, hadn't we better
turn the whole case

419
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,006
over to Scotland yard?

420
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,011
What case?

421
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,298
The Jenkins case, they
know all about that one.

422
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,092
The blackburn case, which
hasn't even happened yet.

423
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:43,183
And the moriarty case, which
they refuse to believe.

424
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,026
Let's go.

425
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,152
Where are we going?

426
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,856
To the offices of the times.

427
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,281
Here's your breakfast.

428
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:55,149
Oh, sorry, Mrs. Hudson,
but we'll be back for lunch.

429
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:02,375
Thank you.

430
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,412
Just what are you looking for?

431
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:11,332
We have to find out when
moriarty was in Egypt, Watson.

432
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:15,263
Ah.

433
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:17,964
Oh, miss.

434
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,679
Would you please bring me volume 105?

435
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:22,018
One moment. I'll get it.

436
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:23,271
Thank you.

437
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,767
We shall soon know.

438
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:29,308
Holmes, couldn't you be
just a little less mysterious?

439
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:30,942
You know my methods, Watson.

440
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,820
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

441
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,907
August.

442
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,286
September.

443
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:43,583
Now then.

444
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,119
Ah, this is it.

445
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:46,499
Here we are.

446
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,080
Here.

447
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,540
Uh-uh.

448
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,001
"Discovery of Cleopatra's tomb,

449
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:54,667
world experts in consultation."

450
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,544
In El faiyum, a group of english

451
00:25:57,848 --> 00:25:59,528
and Egyptian archeologists have discovered

452
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:00,926
a tomb containing treasure.

453
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,262
The tomb is believed to
be that of Cleopatra.

454
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:08,313
Professor moriarty, eminent
english archeologist...

455
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:09,815
Et cetera, et cetera.

456
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,725
Yes, go on. Well, go on, Holmes.

457
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:14,190
Just a moment, Watson.

458
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,490
Aha.

459
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,940
"Thefts of priceless treasure."

460
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,363
Following the reported theft

461
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,100
of priceless treasures from the tomb,

462
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:22,603
two english engineers named Harrison

463
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:23,975
and Samuels have been arrested.

464
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:28,413
A third, Peter blackburn, has
disappeared at the same time

465
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,672
as a casket of gold and
precious stones containing

466
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:33,665
a golden necklace which
belonged to Cleopatra herself.

467
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,612
Watson, we have to prevent another murder.

468
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:38,173
Holmes, I just don't know
what you're talking about.

469
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,032
There isn't a moment to be lost, man.

470
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:40,879
Where are we going now?

471
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:42,619
To a delightful little
Hertfordshire village

472
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:44,053
by the name of barnett.

473
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:45,433
A Hertfordshire village?

474
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:40,818
It's Peter's gun.

475
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:42,483
He's hunting again.

476
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:43,320
He should be stopped.

477
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,431
If we don't stop him, we're
letting @a madman run wild.

478
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:46,661
He's as sane as we are.

479
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:48,017
Then why doesn't he call the police

480
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,041
if his life's threatened?

481
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:50,251
Threatened by whom?

482
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,745
Why doesn't he tell us?

483
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,045
I've no idea.

484
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,657
Why don't you let me take you away?

485
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:03,681
He's my husband.

486
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:05,839
I can't just run away as if I were free.

487
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,724
No, but there's another way out.

488
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,180
You don't owe Peter anything.

489
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,665
His fears have killed his love for you.

490
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,429
And, besides, he's dangerous.

491
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:15,145
I'd never forgive myself if
anything happened to you.

492
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:17,987
What are we to do?

493
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,542
He got away.

494
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:38,835
Peter, why don't you confide in us?

495
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,737
You've got to tell us
what you're afraid of.

496
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:42,547
If you don't, we can't possibly help.

497
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:45,178
How often must I tell
you my life is in danger?

498
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:47,214
Why won't you or the police believe it?

499
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,262
You're seeing ghosts.

500
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,562
Ghosts?

501
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,517
Ghosts that hide behind bushes
and then drive away in cars?

502
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,647
Oh, but we do believe you. We do, Peter.

503
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:59,435
You need help, Peter,
not only from the police.

504
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,693
Ah, yes, you mean a doctor, of course.

505
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,607
Don't think that you're fooling me.

506
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,993
I know exactly what you both would like.

507
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,048
You're trying to find
a way to get rid of me.

508
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,864
I can't go on like this any longer.

509
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:14,704
We seem to be living in a trap.

510
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,914
What and who are you afraid of?

511
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,045
We hide away here in
this terrible old house,

512
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:19,921
but what are we hiding from?

513
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:22,833
Won't you tell us what you're
afraid of once and for all?

514
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,967
How can we help you if
you have no confidence

515
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:26,299
in either of us?

516
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,385
I am your wife, not your enemy.

517
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:31,550
Don't you trust even me?

518
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:32,853
No.

519
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,437
I trust nobody on this earth.

520
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,151
Nobody.

521
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:46,861
It's no use.

522
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:51,872
What are we to do?

523
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,829
Don't worry, Ellen, leave it to me.

524
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:05,501
- Goodnight, Emily.
- Goodnight.

525
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:06,960
Goodnight, Emily.

526
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,475
Miss?

527
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:14,642
Hartley hall is in the
locality, I believe?

528
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,749
Yes, sir. It's down the
street and straight ahead.

529
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:17,834
- Uh-huh.
- You're not thinking

530
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:18,438
of buying it, are you?

531
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,599
It's been unsold for quite some time.

532
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:21,902
We're not buyers.

533
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:23,392
Mr. blackburn still lives there?

534
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,716
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, I wonder if you could

535
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,301
tell us the name of the
local police inspector?

536
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:27,861
Inspector French.

537
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,160
Inspector French?

538
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:30,596
- That's right.
- Would you be good enough

539
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,620
to telephone him?

540
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,266
Tell him Mr. Sherlock Holmes would like

541
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,410
to see him here immediately.

542
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,181
It's a matter of the greatest importance.

543
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,693
Mr. Holmes?

544
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:14,992
Yes.

545
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:18,996
You are inspector French?

546
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:20,766
- That's right.
- Ah, delighted to meet you.

547
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,449
How do you do?

548
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,750
Dr. Watson.

549
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,395
Would you care to sit down
and join us for a beer?

550
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,419
With pleasure.

551
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,731
Another beer, please, miss.

552
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:27,835
Straight away!

553
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,917
Now what can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?

554
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,716
Mr. blackburn is a tenant
of hartley hall, is he not?

555
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,012
He is.

556
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:36,590
Am I right in assuming

557
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,381
that he's in constant fear for his life?

558
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,454
As a matter of fact, he's
in contact with the police

559
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:42,638
at least once every month.

560
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:43,472
Indeed.

561
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:44,832
In that case, I think we should get up

562
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:45,976
to hartley hall immediately.

563
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,585
You mean right now?

564
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:48,609
Right now, inspector.

565
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:52,988
Hello?

566
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:58,449
Just a minute.

567
00:33:58,745 --> 00:33:59,825
For you, inspector.

568
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,201
For me? Ah, yes.

569
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:05,209
Thanks, Emily.

570
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,419
French speaking.

571
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:09,588
Yes, naturally.

572
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:13,794
I'll be there right away.

573
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:20,847
Peter blackburn is dead.

574
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:30,356
His head is completely shattered.

575
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:32,734
Shot at close range, don't you know.

576
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,298
We leave everything as we found it

577
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,187
until the police and Scotland yard come.

578
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,851
Inspector Cooper telephoned to
say that he'd be right along.

579
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,805
By all means,
let us leave everything

580
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:41,829
to inspector Cooper.

581
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:47,324
Where were you when Mr.
Blackburn met his death?

582
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:48,958
I was in my room.

583
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,415
I was doing some reading
before turning in.

584
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:54,047
Then I heard a shot, and I ran downstairs.

585
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,667
Was the door open?

586
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,302
- No.
- Aha.

587
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,964
The murderer broke in
through the French window.

588
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:03,803
He stuck a bit of flypaper on the pane

589
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,902
so the piece of glass
wouldn't make any noise.

590
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,428
It's unquestionably
a professional job.

591
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:10,939
What did you find when you
entered the room, Mr. king?

592
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,234
That.

593
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:15,359
Did you see anyone running away?

594
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,486
- No, I didn't.
- Where was Mrs. blackburn?

595
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,242
Up in her room.

596
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,112
I told her to stay there

597
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:22,946
because I didn't want her to see this.

598
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,612
Do you think he committed suicide?

599
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:29,749
Well, that pane of glass was
pushed in from the outside.

600
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:31,285
There are traces of blood here.

601
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:32,815
The murderer must have stepped in it.

602
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,795
Then that leaves no doubt whatsoever.

603
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,298
Mr. blackburn surprised
a burglar and was killed.

604
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:41,052
The culprit then ran away,
leaving the murder weapon behind.

605
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:43,634
Scotland yard will surely
make the same deduction.

606
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:46,094
It's not quite as
simple as that, inspector.

607
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:52,134
Peter was rehanging that picture

608
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,393
over the fireplace yesterday.

609
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:54,774
That's why the hammer was here.

610
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,715
Why did the intruder leave this ring?

611
00:35:57,739 --> 00:35:58,779
It appears to be of value.

612
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:01,156
I guess he was frightened
and overlooked it.

613
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,158
Where is Mrs. blackburn now?

614
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:06,160
She's upstairs. She's terribly upset.

615
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:07,456
Naturally.

616
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:10,282
No doubt inspector Cooper
will take her statement.

617
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,665
But why did the killer take
blackburn's wedding ring?

618
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:14,236
Maybe he didn't wear one.

619
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:14,915
Oh, that's right.

620
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:17,015
I can't remember Peter
wearing a wedding ring.

621
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,464
No?

622
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,591
Then I suggest we send for the Butler.

623
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,447
Ask the Butler to come here.

624
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:39,822
Oh, there you are.

625
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,229
Do you recall whether Mr.
Blackburn wore his wedding ring

626
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,777
above or below the serpent ring?

627
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:45,533
Hm? Below the serpent ring, sir.

628
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:46,889
You're quite sure?

629
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:47,993
I would swear to it.

630
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,450
We shall see what the
inspector makes of that.

631
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,990
Watson, I seem to remember

632
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,973
some very interesting trees in the garden.

633
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,815
I'd rather like to take
a closer look at them.

634
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,375
What about you? - Oh, yes.

635
00:36:57,674 --> 00:36:58,674
Yes.

636
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:04,253
If you're looking for trees,
they're right in front of you.

637
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:06,797
That would be Scotland yard.

638
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,100
Yes.

639
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:09,473
Inspector Cooper, no doubt.

640
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:10,764
Don't you want to see him?

641
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,020
No, not yet.

642
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,770
What do you suppose that is?

643
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,105
It looks remarkably like a grave.

644
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:21,405
A grave?

645
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:22,967
That's not large enough to bury a dog in.

646
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,982
Be careful, Watson,
don't spoil the footprints.

647
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:25,944
Leave that to the inspector.

648
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,701
What could possibly be buried there?

649
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,120
Clothes.

650
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:33,657
Very old clothes.

651
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:37,751
Old clothes?

652
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,090
I say.

653
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:48,425
He must have tried to defend
himself with the hammer.

654
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:50,386
Precisely, inspector.

655
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,141
Faultless deduction.

656
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:55,053
Ah, so you knew about
this murder too, Mr. Holmes?

657
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,356
Knew? No.

658
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:58,006
But I suspected that it would occur.

659
00:37:58,193 --> 00:37:59,378
Were you
acquainted with the deceased?

660
00:37:59,402 --> 00:37:59,936
I was not.

661
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:02,436
I heard him mentioned for the
first time quite recently.

662
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:03,572
By whom?

663
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:04,925
By a distinguished archeologist

664
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:05,949
whose name is moriarty.

665
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:08,692
Ah, so you naturally assume
that he's the murderer.

666
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:09,654
I'm afraid it's not quite

667
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,274
as simple as all that, inspector.

668
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,538
The gentleman in question
has a perfect alibi.

669
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:16,958
Professor moriarty, the
famous archeologist,

670
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:19,023
will deliver a lecture
on Egyptian antiquities

671
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:20,958
at eight o'clock tonight, at the pen club.

672
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,417
And blackburn was killed
between nine and 10 o'clock.

673
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,667
Correct. So it cannot
possibly be moriarty.

674
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,010
The lecture is over at 11.

675
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:29,637
Well, we know that blackburn
was murdered before 11.

676
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:31,298
Have you any brilliant ideas?

677
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:33,037
I never deliver a theory, inspector,

678
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:34,767
without all the facts at my disposal.

679
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:41,899
Mrs. blackburn, you say
that your husband feared

680
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:43,856
for his life, is that correct?

681
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,816
Do you happen to know whom he feared?

682
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,115
I don't.

683
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,520
May I take the Liberty of
asking you a personal question?

684
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:50,278
Yes.

685
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,034
Were you happily married?

686
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,099
You have no right to ask
such a question, inspector.

687
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,659
I was speaking to Mrs. blackburn.

688
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:56,994
May I have your answer?

689
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:00,793
I loved my husband.

690
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:01,623
Where are you going?!

691
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:03,683
He's run
after somebody out there!

692
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:04,883
I saw him too!

693
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,216
Have Patience, Ellen.

694
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,212
Oh, why didn't Peter confide in us?

695
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:14,720
Looks as if his ghosts
were real after all.

696
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:35,156
Watson!

697
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:36,992
You nearly broke my arm.

698
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,103
What's going on?

699
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:41,163
- Did you catch him?
- Watson nearly caught me.

700
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,669
It's ridiculous to search
any more in the dark.

701
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:45,645
Inspector, will you
please alert the police

702
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,804
throughout this district,
and that of St. albans,

703
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:48,711
to block all the roads

704
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:50,798
and put a guard at the railway stations?

705
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:08,607
Would you please give me
your right shoe, Mr. king?

706
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:09,566
Why?

707
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:11,072
Your right shoe, Mr. king.

708
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:16,496
Thank you.

709
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,500
Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Holmes,

710
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,962
that these footprints could
have come from this slipper?

711
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:34,299
Oh, undoubtedly.

712
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,159
The prints lead to the door.

713
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:37,427
Again, quite correct.

714
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,349
Well, Mr. king?

715
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:44,126
I must have stepped in it, I guess,

716
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:44,855
when I went to the door.

717
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,151
Really?

718
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,985
Wasn't it more likely
that you took out the pane

719
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,480
of the window from the outside

720
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:51,759
to make it look like a burglary,

721
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,263
and returned inside to do the murder?

722
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:55,484
Paul couldn't possibly
have done such a crime.

723
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:56,972
That's what we shall see.

724
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,361
One moment, inspector.

725
00:40:58,665 --> 00:40:59,199
I'll have to ask you please

726
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:01,706
not to interfere in this, Mr. Holmes.

727
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:02,535
I merely wish to point out

728
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:04,996
that the footprints do
not stop at the door.

729
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:12,380
Mr. king's footprints lead to
a heap of earth over there.

730
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:55,595
Ah.

731
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,842
This clothing is perfect evidence.

732
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:01,741
Mr. king, why did you bury these garments

733
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,184
and to whom do they belong?

734
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:08,021
Mrs. blackburn, I trust
that you can furnish me

735
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:09,877
the information that Mr. king will not?

736
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:11,897
Mrs. blackburn had
nothing to do with it.

737
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:15,108
Mrs. blackburn, Mr. king,
will you please follow me?

738
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,954
I am forced to take you both
to London with me, I'm afraid.

739
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,748
You have indeed reconstructed

740
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,132
the case correctly, inspector.

741
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:37,134
My compliments on your perspicacity.

742
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:41,138
And now, perhaps, Mrs.
Blackburn will be good enough

743
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,886
to tell you what really happened.

744
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:53,859
Well, I had just turned

745
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:57,363
the lights off when...

746
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:14,674
Where's Peter?

747
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:16,090
I have no idea.

748
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:16,919
I'm going down.

749
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,220
I want to come too.

750
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:37,024
Hurry, we've got things to do.

751
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,779
What is all this?

752
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:40,395
Ellen, go to your room.

753
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:41,858
Peter, what happened?

754
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:43,571
He came up from behind me.

755
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,657
Fortunately, I had a hammer in my hand.

756
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:46,957
The hammer?

757
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:49,657
And what are you doing with that gun?

758
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:52,963
I'll call the police.

759
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:54,291
No!

760
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,590
But the man is dead.

761
00:43:56,509 --> 00:43:57,509
Who is he?

762
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:00,752
You must help me.

763
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,261
What do you expect me to do?

764
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:05,264
First, we must get him undressed.

765
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:07,853
What do you intend?

766
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:11,228
Ellen, get out of here, please!

767
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,317
Get out!

768
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:22,724
Blackburn shot away the man's face

769
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:24,359
to make the police think it was him.

770
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,223
He then put his serpent
ring on the finger,

771
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:27,987
but was unable get his wedding ring off.

772
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:29,952
Mr. king then buried the clothes,

773
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:31,562
which accounts for his footprints.

774
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:34,202
Peter wanted to be
declared dead officially.

775
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,461
He wanted us to begin a new life.

776
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:38,610
I am not yet convinced of the fact

777
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,465
that the deceased is not Peter blackburn.

778
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:41,761
No?

779
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:45,883
Look at this man's hand.

780
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:49,392
Dark, tanned skin, calluses
all over the fingers

781
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,427
and the palms of the hand.

782
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:54,848
The hand of a man who's done
considerable manual labor.

783
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:57,187
This could not possibly
be Peter blackburn.

784
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:58,771
This is senseless, Ellen.

785
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,686
Peter can't stay hidden away forever.

786
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:02,699
Come on, inspector.

787
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,076
There's a secret room over here.

788
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:16,164
Peter.

789
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:17,499
Open up.

790
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:21,882
Peter!

791
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:25,344
Peter, it's me. Ellen.

792
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:35,148
Oh!

793
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:36,358
Peter.

794
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:51,579
A knife without a handle,
same as with Jenkins.

795
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:52,874
Mm.

796
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,542
What are you cleaning
out your pipe now for?

797
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,851
M-o-r.

798
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:21,797
Before blackburn died, he
tried to write the name

799
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:23,131
of his murderer on the top of the table,

800
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:24,475
obviously, with his wedding ring.

801
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:27,690
M-o-r. Does that convey
anything to you, inspector?

802
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:29,359
M-o-r.

803
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:32,654
Many words begin with m-o-r.

804
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:33,992
Morgue, morning.

805
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:35,292
Or moriarty.

806
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,700
You told us that moriarty has an alibi.

807
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:39,835
My dear inspector,
blackburn had a secret.

808
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:42,042
Moriarty wanted it, and
when he'd gotten it,

809
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:43,581
he had him murdered.

810
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:44,418
Do you know the secret, Holmes?

811
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:46,550
Naturally. I read the times.

812
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:57,897
Well, Charles?

813
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:01,849
Samuels?

814
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:03,393
No. Blackburn.

815
00:47:03,696 --> 00:47:05,778
He'd already taken care of Samuels for us.

816
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:09,816
I always maintain that
Samuels would come to a bad end.

817
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:12,485
Even in Egypt, he was a troublemaker.

818
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:15,780
And if anybody is stupid
enough to ask for 40%,

819
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:19,166
well, Charles, I also maintain
greed will get you nowhere.

820
00:47:19,462 --> 00:47:20,918
Do you follow me, Charles?

821
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:23,750
Naturally, professor.

822
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:03,812
I say, I'm awfully sorry.

823
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:05,188
My foot slipped the clutch.

824
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:06,956
Just look at what you've done to my car!

825
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:08,647
Now you control yourself.

826
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:09,560
There isn't much damage.

827
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:10,398
Oh, no?

828
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:11,698
What's this all about?

829
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:13,586
This stupid idiot
bumps smack into my car.

830
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,571
How dare you? You mind your language.

831
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:18,202
- Oh.
- Your licenses, please.

832
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:19,077
Mm.

833
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:20,933
That's right, officer, take his name.

834
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,914
He'll have to take care of the damages.

835
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:29,213
Oh. I say, are you free?

836
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:30,694
- Yes, sir.
- Will you please take me

837
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:31,298
to park Lane road?

838
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:32,594
Ah.

839
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:40,808
Move your cars, please.

840
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,414
Thank you for your kindness, constable.

841
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:44,178
You've been most understanding.

842
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:46,816
My keys!

843
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:48,147
My keys are gone!

844
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:48,978
Really?

845
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:51,519
Well, I'll help you
find them, dear fellow.

846
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:11,463
Would you be good enough to wait

847
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:12,799
over there until I return?

848
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:13,927
Over there.

849
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:19,649
Charles?

850
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:56,012
Ah, you don't
expect to find them

851
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:56,845
under there, do you?

852
00:55:57,145 --> 00:55:57,725
Unless you stole them,

853
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,207
they've got to be somewhere.
Wouldn't dare.

854
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,687
What would I do with your keys?

855
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:08,614
Taxi!

856
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,615
Here you are, good man.

857
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:16,914
I beg your pardon?

858
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:19,740
9 hartley road. Hurry!

859
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:31,217
Ah. What have we here?

860
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:34,004
Aha, the times.

861
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:35,508
What's the surprise for today?

862
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:37,887
You told me you always
find something of import in it.

863
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:40,222
Today, it contains
something very special.

864
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:41,522
Really?

865
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:43,472
What? - Look for yourself.

866
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:48,029
Ah.

867
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:49,357
The famous necklace.

868
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,521
Precisely. The necklace and the casket.

869
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:54,066
That's why Peter blackburn was murdered.

870
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:55,680
You've solved the case, Holmes,

871
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:57,098
right under the noses of the police.

872
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,282
It isn't solved yet.

873
00:56:58,582 --> 00:57:01,244
I'm simply getting the evidence
together to hang moriarty.

874
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:04,292
Gentlemen, I am highly disappointed.

875
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:06,169
I am not at all impressed.

876
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:09,798
This blatant lack of
discipline in our midst

877
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:13,335
could make me undertake measures

878
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:15,879
that you will find most regrettable.

879
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:18,036
We weren't given orders
to guard the necklace.

880
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:20,802
I require personal initiative.

881
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,846
Do you realize the consequences of failure

882
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:26,265
in this organization?

883
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:30,613
Charles?

884
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:31,781
Yes, professor.

885
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:33,067
Come in here.

886
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:36,320
Come in, I say!

887
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:45,586
Shut the door.

888
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:54,923
Where have you been?

889
00:57:55,222 --> 00:57:56,507
I had a slight accident.

890
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:58,138
An old idiot drove right into me,

891
00:57:58,433 --> 00:57:59,553
but there isn't much damage.

892
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:00,841
Where's the car?

893
00:58:02,354 --> 00:58:03,874
I came by cab so I wouldn't be late.

894
00:58:03,939 --> 00:58:04,939
I see.

895
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:07,522
But I thought you said there
was very little damage.

896
00:58:08,527 --> 00:58:11,189
Yes. Only I couldn't
find the keys afterwards.

897
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:17,451
You traitor.

898
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:21,741
You're the fool to whom
we owe our failure.

899
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,406
They set a trap for you and
you fell right in to it.

900
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:28,004
Who, professor?

901
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,753
Sherlock Holmes.

902
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:32,255
You're mistaken.

903
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:35,133
That idiot in the daimler,
that wasn't Sherlock Holmes.

904
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:38,921
The man driving the daimler
was his friend Watson.

905
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:42,261
And meanwhile, Holmes
stole the keys to the car!

906
00:58:42,561 --> 00:58:43,561
And then came here.

907
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:50,933
Would you like to become acquainted

908
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:52,817
with this little plaything, Charles?

909
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:03,324
I can only hope that Holmes
has gathered enough evidence

910
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:06,740
to hang you for blackburn's
murder, Charles.

911
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:08,044
That's all you deserve.

912
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:12,420
Gentlemen, I trust you are
sufficiently intelligent

913
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:14,276
that it's not necessary to convince you

914
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:17,550
that the necklace must be
recovered with the utmost speed.

915
00:59:17,846 --> 00:59:19,586
You have exactly 48 hours.

916
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:24,682
I believe I shall turn over
the supervision of this mission

917
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:28,470
to one of our most farsighted
and reliable collaborators.

918
00:59:28,774 --> 00:59:30,059
Inform the doctor immediately.

919
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:40,802
I take it that you are now convinced,

920
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:42,309
inspector, that professor moriarty's

921
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:44,698
activities are not entirely legitimate.

922
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,239
It's incredible.

923
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:52,745
A world-famous authority on
archeology, a common thief.

924
00:59:53,757 --> 00:59:54,997
And a murderer.

925
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,300
Precisely.

926
00:59:58,136 --> 00:59:59,136
Yes?

927
01:00:02,182 --> 01:00:03,422
Oh, professor moriarty.

928
01:00:04,768 --> 01:00:06,975
This is indeed a pleasant surprise.

929
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:10,478
Mr. Holmes doesn't seem as
pleased as yourself, inspector.

930
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:12,139
Do you know this gentleman?

931
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:15,101
Yes, we have already had the pleasure.

932
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:16,768
Am I welcome to join you?

933
01:00:17,072 --> 01:00:18,132
- Please do.
- We met in court,

934
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:19,566
as I recall, the Perry case.

935
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:21,617
Perry?

936
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:23,984
Perry. Yes, quite so.

937
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:25,473
The name escaped me for a minute.

938
01:00:25,497 --> 01:00:27,488
A burglary case, wasn't it?

939
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:29,907
Yes, Perry stole some jewelry in Milan.

940
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:32,833
Of course, you didn't
know anything about it.

941
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:34,250
Naturally not, Mr. Holmes.

942
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:36,372
And the jury was quite
convinced at the time,

943
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:37,675
as you will recall.

944
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:46,298
And this necklace,
has it also been stolen?

945
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,468
Yes, it has.

946
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:51,451
I must confess that
this is the very reason

947
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:53,187
for my visit here today, inspector.

948
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,003
That is the missing Cleopatra necklace

949
01:00:55,152 --> 01:00:56,517
in its original casket.

950
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:58,020
Disappeared over six years ago

951
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,362
during our excavations in Egypt.

952
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:02,575
Where was it located?

953
01:01:02,701 --> 01:01:03,986
In your study, professor.

954
01:01:05,162 --> 01:01:06,162
My study?

955
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:08,516
Naturally, you don't know
anything about that either,

956
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:10,434
in spite of the fact that
your men stole it for you

957
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:12,449
and murdered Peter
blackburn in the bargain.

958
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,206
Inspector, I will not permit anyone

959
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,211
to insult me in this crass fashion.

960
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:18,901
Unfortunately, for you, professor,

961
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:21,086
Mr. Holmes can prove his statement.

962
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:25,174
That casket was found in
your study in a mummy case.

963
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:28,071
You know, inspector,
this gentleman reads

964
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:29,846
too many detective stories.

965
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:31,180
Sherlock Holmes has tried

966
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:32,879
to slander me on several occasions,

967
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:34,979
but his accusations have
always been a fiction.

968
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:36,835
I would be delighted if he would search

969
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:39,275
for this mummy case in my study.

970
01:01:39,571 --> 01:01:41,436
I assure you there is none.

971
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:44,857
Do feel free to investigate, inspector.

972
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,400
In any event, I'm pleased these

973
01:01:46,453 --> 01:01:48,535
priceless jewels are in the right hands.

974
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:51,242
No doubt you will turn it over
to the Egyptian government.

975
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:55,079
The Egyptians will be informed
of its recovery, professor.

976
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,738
As soon as we have their consent,
the necklace will be sold,

977
01:01:58,006 --> 01:01:58,665
together with some recent

978
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:00,751
archeological discoveries, at auction.

979
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:03,458
Then its destiny will be fulfilled.

980
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:05,172
Just one moment, professor.

981
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:07,751
It may be slightly more difficult

982
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:10,135
to remove this casket from Scotland yard

983
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:12,551
than from a somewhat
poorly guarded mummy case.

984
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,938
I could cause you very great
difficulties had I a mind to.

985
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:19,065
Difficulties you would not forget!

986
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:23,024
Out of respect for Scotland
yard, I shall forgo doing so.

987
01:02:23,323 --> 01:02:24,323
Good day, gentlemen.

988
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:31,369
A highly successful little interview.

989
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:32,665
Hm?

990
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:35,494
I confess I won't sleep
until I've disposed

991
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:37,910
of this damned necklace, Holmes.

992
01:02:38,213 --> 01:02:39,482
And, of course, you're going to receive

993
01:02:39,506 --> 01:02:40,996
your 10% of the price of sale,

994
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:42,755
as the finder's reward, later.

995
01:02:43,051 --> 01:02:45,633
Just be patient.
Patient for what, inspector?

996
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:47,529
You think it's going to be stolen again?

997
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:49,846
No, no. Nobody could
manage to steal it from here.

998
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:51,781
I certainly hope you're right.

999
01:02:51,977 --> 01:02:53,592
And I personally will carry the box

1000
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:55,055
under heavy police protection

1001
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:56,632
and bring it to the auction block.

1002
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:58,722
Splendid, inspector.

1003
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:00,544
And if you don't have
faith in me, Holmes,

1004
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:02,128
I'd be happy to have you along with me.

1005
01:03:02,362 --> 01:03:03,381
It's your affair, inspector.

1006
01:03:03,405 --> 01:03:04,405
I'm not the police.

1007
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:08,232
And may I inquire what
you are now planning?

1008
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:09,735
All in good time, inspector.

1009
01:03:09,953 --> 01:03:10,953
All in good time.

1010
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:17,876
Hm.

1011
01:03:21,089 --> 01:03:22,954
Next Monday, the Cleopatra necklace

1012
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:24,464
is to be sold at auction.

1013
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:26,545
The property of the Egyptian government,

1014
01:03:26,845 --> 01:03:28,405
this necklace is one of the most valued

1015
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,253
archeological discoveries of all time.

1016
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:31,763
The sale is a great event.

1017
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:33,673
How much do you suppose it'll bring?

1018
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:36,426
It doesn't matter now.

1019
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:38,370
I don't want anything more to do with it.

1020
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:39,883
But, Ellen, Holmes asked us both

1021
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:41,056
to stop in at the auction.

1022
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:42,474
Oh, Paul, must we?

1023
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:45,172
You know how much he
helped us after all.

1024
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:46,276
He must have his reasons.

1025
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:50,107
Ellen.

1026
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:51,410
Come here.

1027
01:03:57,751 --> 01:04:00,037
We'll soon be far away from here.

1028
01:04:00,337 --> 01:04:02,828
There'll be nothing to
remind us of this nightmare.

1029
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:34,238
Well, the archeologist deigns
to meet the criminologist.

1030
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,619
For a secret meeting
of the two great minds.

1031
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:40,748
You are doubtless aware the
necklace of Cleopatra comes up

1032
01:04:41,044 --> 01:04:43,456
for auction tomorrow at mosley's rooms.

1033
01:04:43,755 --> 01:04:45,711
It should bring a very high figure.

1034
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:47,588
It is bound to.

1035
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:49,084
To tell the truth, Mr. Holmes,

1036
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:50,295
I didn't feel absolutely sure

1037
01:04:50,512 --> 01:04:51,792
you'd acknowledge my invitation.

1038
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:53,811
My dear professor, how
could I possibly forgo

1039
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:55,819
the, shall we say,
pleasure of your company?

1040
01:04:56,101 --> 01:04:59,468
The feeling's entirely
mutual, dear Mr. Holmes.

1041
01:04:59,771 --> 01:05:02,057
Frankly, I do regret you
have such an opinion of me.

1042
01:05:02,357 --> 01:05:05,690
Oh, but I have nothing against
you personally, professor.

1043
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:07,945
On the contrary, the
fertility of your imagination

1044
01:05:08,196 --> 01:05:08,776
greatly impresses me.

1045
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:11,609
This afternoon, for
instance, at Scotland yard,

1046
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:12,988
a masterly performance.

1047
01:05:13,284 --> 01:05:14,284
Masterly.

1048
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:16,412
And now, professor?

1049
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:18,403
I shouldn't be surprised

1050
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:20,662
if you were a natural mind reader, Holmes.

1051
01:05:20,959 --> 01:05:24,167
As it happens, I was thinking
of making you a proposal.

1052
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:25,042
Indeed.

1053
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:26,794
Would you like to sit down?

1054
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:28,090
Thank you.

1055
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:36,137
A partnership, Mr. Holmes.

1056
01:05:37,267 --> 01:05:38,347
A partnership, professor?

1057
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,346
Let's say 6,000 pounds per annum

1058
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:42,556
and, naturally, a share of the profits.

1059
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:45,142
In my opinion, murder is not profitable.

1060
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:47,023
You underestimate me, Holmes.

1061
01:05:48,153 --> 01:05:49,438
We are both men of logic

1062
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:51,693
and we possess extraordinary intellect.

1063
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:53,350
But we are both wasting our forces

1064
01:05:53,533 --> 01:05:54,613
warring against each other.

1065
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:57,784
And if I may say so, dear
Holmes, this is illogical.

1066
01:05:58,079 --> 01:05:59,944
We should unite our talents and forces.

1067
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:02,739
Such a partnership would
be sure to succeed.

1068
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:05,166
No doubt it would, professor.

1069
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:08,124
Then I may assume you accept?

1070
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:11,055
The picture you paint
is a very alluring one.

1071
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:13,633
There's only one answer that I can give.

1072
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:15,168
Much as I regret it,

1073
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:18,930
I shall have to continue
to waste my energies.

1074
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:23,431
I have only one ambition at
present, to see you hanged.

1075
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:28,769
A regrettable decision
indeed, Mr. Holmes.

1076
01:06:32,906 --> 01:06:35,363
Does this belong to you? It
has a somewhat familiar look.

1077
01:06:36,284 --> 01:06:38,525
It's one of my favorite playthings.

1078
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:40,819
But it has one small defect.

1079
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:44,076
Slips once in a while.

1080
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:46,366
Accidents will happen, professor.

1081
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:06,765
In any case, you lose, Mr. Holmes.

1082
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:15,020
Your move, professor.

1083
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,321
Well, I hope it won't
get us into trouble

1084
01:07:37,345 --> 01:07:40,428
with the police, Holmes,
using those whistles.

1085
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:41,723
Good idea though.

1086
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:43,135
Elementary, my dear Watson.

1087
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:21,430
How about him?

1088
01:08:23,558 --> 01:08:25,469
No. Out of the question.

1089
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:29,894
How about the card shark?

1090
01:08:32,025 --> 01:08:33,225
Full house.

1091
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,850
Mm, he might pass, when he's sober.

1092
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:38,723
He never drinks when he's working.

1093
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:47,449
How do you like frank?

1094
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:48,363
He's all right.

1095
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:49,666
Mm-mm.

1096
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:52,200
I don't trust frank. He's
always chasing women.

1097
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:53,037
So what?

1098
01:08:53,338 --> 01:08:55,169
And besides, he talks
too much for my taste.

1099
01:08:57,634 --> 01:08:58,794
How's that one?

1100
01:09:01,304 --> 01:09:02,794
Oh, not at any price.

1101
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:04,923
He's under police observation.

1102
01:09:05,183 --> 01:09:07,174
You might as well bring along a policeman.

1103
01:09:07,477 --> 01:09:08,717
I must have at least two men.

1104
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:10,935
- That's the problem.
- Hey, look at that, will you?

1105
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:12,147
Hey, come have a drink!

1106
01:09:12,273 --> 01:09:13,273
Ohl

1107
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:36,793
On your way now.

1108
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:38,150
I'm not finished with him yet.

1109
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:38,879
Oh, leave him alone, mate.

1110
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:40,631
Not worth it, is he?

1111
01:09:40,927 --> 01:09:42,042
All right.

1112
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:43,345
If you say so.

1113
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:44,388
Don't hold it against me.

1114
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,216
How about a beer, hey?

1115
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:50,300
Waitress, one whiskey, one beer.

1116
01:09:52,105 --> 01:09:53,390
Where'd you learn that?

1117
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:55,931
I spent 15 years with a knife thrower.

1118
01:09:56,234 --> 01:09:57,795
He used to pin his wife down every night,

1119
01:09:57,819 --> 01:09:58,819
on the stage, of course.

1120
01:10:00,113 --> 01:10:01,398
Then he happened to slip once.

1121
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:06,524
Nice little toy, doctor.

1122
01:10:06,828 --> 01:10:08,409
Comes in handy from time to time.

1123
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:11,912
Where'd you meet this knife thrower?

1124
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:13,208
Tell us.

1125
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:13,951
In a circus?

1126
01:10:14,252 --> 01:10:15,617
Not exactly.

1127
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,680
We used to share a room,
as a matter of fact.

1128
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:19,042
Bars in front of the window.

1129
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:20,330
Lovely view though.

1130
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:21,668
Over the moors.

1131
01:10:23,428 --> 01:10:24,964
You were in dartmoor?

1132
01:10:25,263 --> 01:10:27,049
I didn't say that, did I?

1133
01:10:27,348 --> 01:10:28,348
Good health.

1134
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:34,389
What are you up to now?

1135
01:10:34,689 --> 01:10:36,645
That's my business, chum.

1136
01:10:36,941 --> 01:10:39,307
Mm, I don't approve of this fella.

1137
01:10:40,278 --> 01:10:40,937
Oh?

1138
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:43,819
Well, come to think of it, I
don't think much of you either.

1139
01:10:44,115 --> 01:10:45,217
I wouldn't have thrown one
of these pretty little things

1140
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:47,698
if it'd been to save your lovely face.

1141
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:48,699
Where'd you dig him up anyway?

1142
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:49,995
Ladies hairdresser's?

1143
01:10:51,122 --> 01:10:52,487
Well, thanks for the beer.

1144
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:53,790
Just a minute.

1145
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:55,477
What's your name?
What's your game, mister?

1146
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:58,288
- All right, all right, boys-
- Hey, what's the idea?!

1147
01:11:06,554 --> 01:11:08,090
Just a minute, hey?

1148
01:11:11,058 --> 01:11:12,058
Hm.

1149
01:11:12,894 --> 01:11:14,475
That's solves it.

1150
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:16,605
And ends all right.

1151
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:18,013
Release papers from dartmoor.

1152
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:21,104
What were you sentenced for?

1153
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,395
None of your business.

1154
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:23,695
Uh-huh.

1155
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:28,648
Most interesting.

1156
01:11:30,161 --> 01:11:31,721
Herewith, Lawrence Alexander kopernick,

1157
01:11:31,913 --> 01:11:34,370
originally sentenced for
burglary, is to report weekly

1158
01:11:34,665 --> 01:11:36,425
at police headquarters
to his parole officer.

1159
01:11:36,584 --> 01:11:37,790
All right, now you know.

1160
01:11:38,085 --> 01:11:39,450
Police!

1161
01:11:47,094 --> 01:11:50,006
All right. Well, let's have a talk.

1162
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:51,762
Sit down.

1163
01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:55,766
If you're interested, we
might have a job for you.

1164
01:11:56,062 --> 01:11:57,062
How much?

1165
01:11:57,688 --> 01:11:58,688
Oh.

1166
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:01,566
It pays.

1167
01:12:05,905 --> 01:12:08,442
Here, you have a map of
the underground sewers.

1168
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:11,323
Now, that's where we're
planning to operate.

1169
01:12:11,619 --> 01:12:15,077
Look, now, here...

1170
01:12:41,107 --> 01:12:42,472
We are here.

1171
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:45,642
And over here is the mosley auction house.

1172
01:12:46,696 --> 01:12:48,652
The police Van will take this route.

1173
01:12:48,948 --> 01:12:50,859
I have the entire circuit
under heavy guard.

1174
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:52,443
Holmes thought it advisable.

1175
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:54,179
He believes the necklace will be snatched

1176
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:55,534
before it gets to mosley's.

1177
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:56,910
It seems rather far-fetched

1178
01:12:57,164 --> 01:12:59,075
to imagine anyone trying
to steal a package

1179
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,957
from a sealed police Van
right in broad daylight.

1180
01:13:02,253 --> 01:13:05,416
In any event, I will be in
the Van with two of my men.

1181
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:07,626
Yes, we'll leave in exactly 15 minutes.

1182
01:13:07,925 --> 01:13:09,836
Right you are, inspector.

1183
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:11,136
Ah, hum.

1184
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:54,854
Whoa.

1185
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:37,154
Get a move on.

1186
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:39,065
All right.

1187
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:40,368
Go ahead now.

1188
01:16:00,514 --> 01:16:02,425
Help me out of here.

1189
01:16:08,272 --> 01:16:09,352
- Hey!
- What?

1190
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:53,393
And here is a vase, 1,200 bc.

1191
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:54,932
Exceptionally well-preserved.

1192
01:16:55,236 --> 01:16:57,318
Bidding to start at a thousand pounds.

1193
01:16:57,613 --> 01:16:59,444
Do I hear 1,100?

1194
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:01,071
Ah, 1,100.

1195
01:17:01,367 --> 01:17:02,447
1,200.

1196
01:17:02,743 --> 01:17:04,074
Do I hear 1,300?

1197
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:06,944
1,300!

1198
01:17:07,248 --> 01:17:08,954
Will anyone offer 1,400?

1199
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:11,081
Do I hear 1,400?

1200
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:15,002
Going at 1,300.

1201
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:18,380
1,300, going, going, gone.

1202
01:17:18,676 --> 01:17:19,945
Sold to the gentleman

1203
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:20,969
in the center.

1204
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:29,637
Head of a tomb statue, the
only known one of its kind.

1205
01:17:29,937 --> 01:17:30,937
What am I bid?

1206
01:17:40,823 --> 01:17:43,030
Head of king amenhotep ii.

1207
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:44,405
Do I hear any bids?

1208
01:17:50,374 --> 01:17:52,094
Ladies and gentlemen,
I regret to inform you

1209
01:17:52,168 --> 01:17:53,408
that the Cleopatra necklace,

1210
01:17:53,711 --> 01:17:55,952
which was to have gone on sale today,

1211
01:17:56,255 --> 01:17:58,615
has been withdrawn from the
auction, as it is not available.

1212
01:17:58,799 --> 01:17:59,799
It's been withdrawn?!

1213
01:17:59,842 --> 01:18:01,127
What's the meaning of this?

1214
01:18:01,427 --> 01:18:02,547
I don't understand why it is

1215
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:05,252
that the most valuable
things always vanish.

1216
01:18:05,556 --> 01:18:06,556
1,300.

1217
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:09,006
Do I hear 14?

1218
01:18:10,227 --> 01:18:12,218
Does anyone bid 1,400?

1219
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:15,350
Going at 1,300.

1220
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:19,100
At 1,300.

1221
01:18:19,403 --> 01:18:20,403
Not bidding, professor?

1222
01:18:20,613 --> 01:18:22,413
- Going, going, gone!
- I have all the objects

1223
01:18:22,448 --> 01:18:22,982
I'm interested in.

1224
01:18:23,282 --> 01:18:24,522
Are you quite sure?

1225
01:18:24,825 --> 01:18:25,530
The the lady in the rear.

1226
01:18:25,826 --> 01:18:27,012
Unless you should happen to be aware

1227
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:29,322
of something which might tempt me.

1228
01:18:29,622 --> 01:18:31,362
Far be it from me to
give any suggestions

1229
01:18:31,665 --> 01:18:33,621
to an expert such as yourself.

1230
01:18:33,918 --> 01:18:37,001
I understand you believe in
buying as little as possible.

1231
01:18:37,296 --> 01:18:39,708
That's what is most satisfying.

1232
01:18:40,007 --> 01:18:42,293
Somehow, many of the best
objects seem to find their way

1233
01:18:42,593 --> 01:18:44,504
into my private collection.

1234
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:45,803
Not always, professor.

1235
01:18:45,888 --> 01:18:47,968
Excuse me,
is there a Mr. Holmes here?

1236
01:18:48,224 --> 01:18:49,555
Yes?

1237
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:51,161
Would you please step into the office?

1238
01:18:51,185 --> 01:18:52,185
Thank you.

1239
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:54,789
What are my
bids for this unique example

1240
01:18:54,813 --> 01:18:56,678
of early Egyptian pottery?

1241
01:18:56,982 --> 01:18:58,813
Ladies and gentlemen, do I hear any bids?

1242
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:01,521
900 pounds!

1243
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:04,152
900 pounds.
Do I hear a thousand?

1244
01:19:04,448 --> 01:19:05,528
1,000.

1245
01:19:05,824 --> 01:19:07,155
Do I hear 1,100?

1246
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:10,655
Yes, and give the information

1247
01:19:10,955 --> 01:19:12,365
immediately to the commissioner.

1248
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:17,867
Oh, Mr. Holmes.

1249
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:19,751
Have you heard about what occurred?

1250
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:21,753
I warned you, inspector.

1251
01:19:22,049 --> 01:19:23,360
No doubt it will interest you to learn

1252
01:19:23,384 --> 01:19:24,669
that the men who were involved

1253
01:19:24,969 --> 01:19:26,755
in the theft have been apprehended.

1254
01:19:27,054 --> 01:19:28,669
Yes, I know.

1255
01:19:28,973 --> 01:19:30,053
How could you know that?

1256
01:19:31,141 --> 01:19:33,370
Why do you suppose that the
police were in the right place

1257
01:19:33,394 --> 01:19:35,180
at that time, inspector?

1258
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:36,873
My friend, Dr. Watson was good enough

1259
01:19:36,897 --> 01:19:38,762
to notify Scotland yard.

1260
01:19:41,694 --> 01:19:43,400
It disappeared under my very eyes.

1261
01:19:44,321 --> 01:19:45,606
This is no joking matter.

1262
01:19:45,906 --> 01:19:46,906
I wonder where it can be.

1263
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:50,741
On its way here by post.

1264
01:19:55,082 --> 01:19:57,073
A package for Mr. Holmes.

1265
01:20:01,422 --> 01:20:02,422
Thank you.

1266
01:20:08,429 --> 01:20:09,429
There you are.

1267
01:20:09,596 --> 01:20:10,596
Thank you.

1268
01:20:35,622 --> 01:20:38,785
Now if you will excuse me,
I'll get back to the auction.

1269
01:20:39,084 --> 01:20:40,084
Uh...

1270
01:20:42,755 --> 01:20:44,245
Do I hear 2,100?

1271
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:48,882
For 2,000 pounds, going, going, gone.

1272
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:55,596
Excuse me,
would you please announce

1273
01:20:55,893 --> 01:20:57,884
that the Cleopatra necklace has arrived.

1274
01:20:58,187 --> 01:21:00,143
It can be reinstated in today's auction.

1275
01:21:03,317 --> 01:21:05,433
Ladies and gentlemen, it
is my pleasure to announce

1276
01:21:05,736 --> 01:21:07,192
that, contrary to prior withdrawal,

1277
01:21:07,488 --> 01:21:09,608
one of the most exceptional
of all archeological finds

1278
01:21:09,823 --> 01:21:11,609
will be on sale today.

1279
01:21:11,909 --> 01:21:13,570
The Cleopatra necklace.

1280
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:18,099
It's sure fortunate that it was restored

1281
01:21:18,123 --> 01:21:20,455
to the collection in time for auctioning.

1282
01:21:20,751 --> 01:21:22,187
The necklace is in perfect condition

1283
01:21:22,211 --> 01:21:23,371
and is being offered for sale

1284
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:24,952
in a diamond-encrusted Jewel case

1285
01:21:25,255 --> 01:21:27,120
in which it was discovered.

1286
01:21:27,424 --> 01:21:29,540
I would like to inquire
about what proof exists

1287
01:21:29,843 --> 01:21:31,763
as to the authenticity of
the Cleopatra necklace.

1288
01:21:32,054 --> 01:21:33,414
With us today is one of the most

1289
01:21:33,597 --> 01:21:36,213
noted archeological experts in the world.

1290
01:21:36,517 --> 01:21:38,929
Professor moriarty,
would you be good enough

1291
01:21:39,228 --> 01:21:42,061
to give us your opinion of this necklace?

1292
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:05,080
Yes, this is indeed the
necklace attributed to Cleopatra.

1293
01:22:07,381 --> 01:22:09,292
May I extend our appreciation.

1294
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:12,503
I am asked to offer this
necklace for 100,000 pounds.

1295
01:22:12,803 --> 01:22:14,794
May I call for a bid of 110, please?

1296
01:22:15,097 --> 01:22:16,303
Do I hear an offer of 110?

1297
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:18,213
110,000! - 120!

1298
01:22:18,517 --> 01:22:20,473
120,000.

1299
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:22,600
Do I hear 130?

1300
01:22:22,896 --> 01:22:25,228
130,000 pounds. - 140!

1301
01:22:25,524 --> 01:22:27,810
140,000 pounds!

1302
01:22:35,033 --> 01:22:36,833
Who finally
purchased the necklace?

1303
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:37,910
A collector from Texas.

1304
01:22:38,162 --> 01:22:38,651
Ah.

1305
01:22:38,954 --> 01:22:40,274
I feel I won't be able to breathe

1306
01:22:40,456 --> 01:22:41,821
until it's out of the country.

1307
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:44,615
Now perhaps you'll tell me
what I got these roses for?

1308
01:22:44,918 --> 01:22:46,283
Oh. Roses?

1309
01:22:46,587 --> 01:22:47,702
Oh, yes, the roses.

1310
01:22:48,005 --> 01:22:49,485
My dear Watson, you're a married man.

1311
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:50,590
Don't be so unromantic.

1312
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:55,001
Oh, oh, oh, Mrs. blackburn,

1313
01:22:55,304 --> 01:22:57,636
may I offer you our felicitations?

1314
01:22:57,931 --> 01:22:59,796
- Oh.
- Oh, and our warm wishes

1315
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:01,180
for your future happiness.

1316
01:23:02,436 --> 01:23:03,095
Thank you.

1317
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:04,795
It's very kind of you.

1318
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:07,221
Oh!

1319
01:23:07,524 --> 01:23:08,855
Thank you.

1320
01:23:09,151 --> 01:23:10,670
Frankly, Mr. Holmes,
we were wondering why

1321
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:11,979
you insisted on our coming here.

1322
01:23:12,279 --> 01:23:14,361
Mrs. blackburn, you have
just seen the disposal

1323
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:16,863
of something that has caused
you the greatest anguish.

1324
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:19,159
I asked you both to come
here to see for yourselves

1325
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:21,322
that there's still some
truth in the old saying,

1326
01:23:21,622 --> 01:23:22,953
"all's well that ends well."

1327
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:25,791
Thank you.

1328
01:23:28,879 --> 01:23:29,879
Ah, professor.

1329
01:23:30,047 --> 01:23:33,790
Mm, the great master
detective in police custody.

1330
01:23:34,968 --> 01:23:36,208
May 1?

1331
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:37,512
With pleasure.

1332
01:23:39,223 --> 01:23:41,303
Here's a little toy which
I think will interest you

1333
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:42,673
very much indeed, inspector.

1334
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:43,976
Watch it.

1335
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:55,894
You should treat my
little toy with more care.

1336
01:23:56,198 --> 01:23:57,654
After all, it's an art object.

1337
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:04,349
Whiskey in the handle
of a walking stick.

1338
01:24:04,373 --> 01:24:06,173
I always find it helps
to take a small drink

1339
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:08,018
when it's chilly in London, Mr. Holmes.

1340
01:24:08,126 --> 01:24:09,270
Thank you. I never drink before six.

1341
01:24:09,294 --> 01:24:10,955
Would the inspector like one?

1342
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,705
No, never on duty.

1343
01:24:16,009 --> 01:24:16,589
Dr. Watson?

1344
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:18,091
No, thanks.

1345
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:20,503
And I'm not in the least chilly today.

1346
01:24:20,806 --> 01:24:21,806
What a shame.

1347
01:24:22,849 --> 01:24:24,760
Frankly, it's sad to see england lose

1348
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:27,051
such a magnificent piece.

1349
01:24:27,354 --> 01:24:28,594
Anything more I can do for you?

1350
01:24:28,772 --> 01:24:30,478
No thank you, professor.

1351
01:24:30,774 --> 01:24:32,560
But we shall need you very soon.

1352
01:24:32,859 --> 01:24:34,895
To examine an object of
archeological interest,

1353
01:24:35,195 --> 01:24:36,195
I presume, Mr. Holmes?

1354
01:24:36,238 --> 01:24:37,238
Not exactly.

1355
01:24:37,823 --> 01:24:39,984
Scotland yard has recently
arrested a gang of thieves

1356
01:24:40,284 --> 01:24:41,524
who specialize in art objects.

1357
01:24:41,827 --> 01:24:44,489
Oh? Interesting.

1358
01:24:44,788 --> 01:24:45,788
Very.

1359
01:24:45,998 --> 01:24:48,114
The trial will be interesting too,

1360
01:24:48,417 --> 01:24:50,032
especially for you, professor.

1361
01:24:51,128 --> 01:24:52,328
I feel sure that you will take

1362
01:24:52,379 --> 01:24:53,960
a prominent part in the proceedings.

1363
01:24:55,507 --> 01:24:58,044
You can always rely on
my goodwill, inspector,

1364
01:24:58,343 --> 01:25:00,800
in so far as my schedule will permit.

1365
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:02,096
Good day, gentlemen.

1366
01:25:08,604 --> 01:25:10,845
As it happens, I'm going
in that direction myself.

1367
01:25:11,148 --> 01:25:12,809
- Much obliged, sir.
- My pleasure.

1368
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:21,647
Oh, I say, isn't
that professor moriarty?

1369
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:24,407
Yes, and he's
with the buyer from Texas.

1370
01:25:24,703 --> 01:25:27,035
Well, at least
the necklace is safe now.

1371
01:25:28,498 --> 01:25:30,329
Don't underestimate moriarty, Watson.

1372
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:34,080
Come along, we have work to do.
