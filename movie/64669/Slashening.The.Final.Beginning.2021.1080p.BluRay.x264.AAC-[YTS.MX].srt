(ominous music)

5
00:00:29,325 --> 00:00:30,868
- [Steph] Should we order pizza?

6
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,204
- [Greg] Nah, nobody
will deliver out here.

7
00:00:33,496 --> 00:00:34,747
- [Jason] Wow, look at all this space.

8
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:36,415
- [Kyle] This place is huge.

9
00:00:36,749 --> 00:00:39,794
- [Jason] Yeah, how are you
able to afford this place?

10
00:00:40,086 --> 00:00:41,963
- [Greg] I got a really
great deal on it actually.

11
00:00:42,255 --> 00:00:43,714
And it came furnished.

12
00:00:44,006 --> 00:00:45,466
- [Zed] How'd you get such a good deal?

13
00:00:45,758 --> 00:00:49,220
- Well, you know, it's
a pretty crazy story.

14
00:00:50,846 --> 00:00:52,515
If you want to hear it.

15
00:00:52,807 --> 00:00:53,683
- Yeah.

16
00:00:53,975 --> 00:00:54,600
- I like a story.

17
00:00:54,892 --> 00:00:55,601
- All right.

18
00:00:55,893 --> 00:00:56,644
Check it out.

19
00:00:56,936 --> 00:01:01,607
So have you guys ever heard
of the Long Island Slashening?

20
00:01:02,525 --> 00:01:03,317
- Oh yeah.

21
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:06,571
Didn't a bunch of kids get
like killed or something?

22
00:01:06,862 --> 00:01:07,613
- Yep.

23
00:01:11,242 --> 00:01:12,034
- No.

24
00:01:12,326 --> 00:01:14,036
This is not the house where it happened.

25
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,871
- Yeah it is, man.

26
00:01:16,163 --> 00:01:18,416
- Wait, what is this Slashening thing?

27
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:22,211
- Okay, so about five
years ago, a group of girls

28
00:01:22,503 --> 00:01:24,797
were having a little get together.

29
00:01:25,089 --> 00:01:26,257
Invited some boys over.

30
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:27,592
Drinking, some drugs.

31
00:01:27,883 --> 00:01:29,385
You know, usual girl stuff.

32
00:01:29,677 --> 00:01:30,886
(scattered laughing)

33
00:01:31,178 --> 00:01:33,514
So anyway, the neighbors apparently

34
00:01:33,806 --> 00:01:35,975
got driven insane by this noise

35
00:01:36,267 --> 00:01:39,103
and they came over and
slaughtered everyone.

36
00:01:39,395 --> 00:01:41,814
Including a couple pizza guys.

37
00:01:42,857 --> 00:01:47,153
They just picked everyone
off one by one by one.

38
00:01:47,445 --> 00:01:50,573
'Til the final two girls,
Lucy and Margot, fought back.

39
00:01:50,865 --> 00:01:52,033
Killed them.

40
00:01:52,325 --> 00:01:54,160
But then Lucy snapped.

41
00:01:54,452 --> 00:01:55,703
She killed Margot.

42
00:01:55,995 --> 00:01:57,246
Her best friend.

43
00:01:58,164 --> 00:02:01,167
And she got sent to an insane asylum.

44
00:02:02,543 --> 00:02:05,379
Where she remains to this very day.

45
00:02:06,756 --> 00:02:07,757
Dope, right?

46
00:02:08,049 --> 00:02:09,634
(group laughing)

47
00:02:09,925 --> 00:02:10,676
- [Jason] Come on, that's not true.

48
00:02:10,968 --> 00:02:12,845
- People were murdered in this house?

49
00:02:13,137 --> 00:02:14,388
- Yeah, pretty brutal stuff too.

50
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,931
A guy got castrated in the kitchen.

51
00:02:16,223 --> 00:02:17,016
- Oh that is nasty.

52
00:02:17,308 --> 00:02:18,017
Come on.

53
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:21,145
- I don't feel all that comfortable
being in a murder house.

54
00:02:21,437 --> 00:02:22,938
- What are you scared of?

55
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,190
You scared of some ghosts?

56
00:02:24,482 --> 00:02:25,524
Some ghosts are gonna be here?

57
00:02:25,816 --> 00:02:26,734
(group laughs)

58
00:02:27,026 --> 00:02:28,194
Copycat killers?

59
00:02:29,236 --> 00:02:31,530
What, is Lucy gonna find out that people

60
00:02:31,822 --> 00:02:33,449
moved into the house and escape

61
00:02:33,741 --> 00:02:35,284
from the insane asylum and come kill us?

62
00:02:35,576 --> 00:02:38,329
(group laughs)

63
00:02:38,621 --> 00:02:39,705
She's on lockdown!

64
00:02:39,997 --> 00:02:40,665
Come on.

65
00:02:40,956 --> 00:02:41,749
Stop being a scaredy cat.

66
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:42,958
Let's check out the house.

67
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:43,918
The place is great.

68
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:44,877
Furnished!

69
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:47,505
- I'm gonna go get another beer.

70
00:02:47,797 --> 00:02:48,839
- Oh, there's some cold ones

71
00:02:49,131 --> 00:02:50,174
in the fridge in the basement.

72
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:51,634
- Cool.

73
00:02:51,926 --> 00:02:53,094
- Oh, that is where the neighbor

74
00:02:53,386 --> 00:02:56,472
got dismembered though, so be careful.

75
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,224
- Fuck you.

76
00:02:59,975 --> 00:03:02,603
(ominous music)

77
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,705
No killers down here, right?

78
00:03:20,996 --> 00:03:23,541
Serial or otherwise with the knives

79
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,710
and the claws and the...

80
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,170
Lucy!

81
00:03:30,548 --> 00:03:31,173
(cat meows)

82
00:03:31,465 --> 00:03:32,133
Oh shit!

83
00:03:34,468 --> 00:03:35,886
Zed, come on, man.

84
00:03:36,846 --> 00:03:37,930
You're fine.

85
00:03:38,222 --> 00:03:43,102
(ominous music)
(killer growling)

86
00:03:47,815 --> 00:03:49,400
Stupid ass story.

87
00:03:49,692 --> 00:03:51,777
(Zed gasps)

88
00:03:57,241 --> 00:04:00,494
(gentle acoustic music)

89
00:04:04,165 --> 00:04:06,459
- Should we really be doing
this in the murder house?

90
00:04:06,751 --> 00:04:08,502
- Well maybe we should counter that

91
00:04:08,794 --> 00:04:10,379
by making it a love house.

92
00:04:10,671 --> 00:04:13,382
(couple laughing)

93
00:04:16,177 --> 00:04:18,220
I am crushing this.

94
00:04:18,512 --> 00:04:19,388
Wait, wait.

95
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,306
(dramatic sting)

96
00:04:20,598 --> 00:04:21,891
Are you able to consent to this?

97
00:04:22,183 --> 00:04:23,476
- Yes, I am.

98
00:04:23,768 --> 00:04:24,643
- Okay cool.

99
00:04:26,061 --> 00:04:27,229
Wait, wait.

100
00:04:27,521 --> 00:04:28,939
It's just you had a couple beers earlier

101
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:30,566
and while you're able to say you consent,

102
00:04:30,858 --> 00:04:33,027
you might actually be too
impaired to really do so.

103
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:35,237
- Yeah, I am totally clear-headed.

104
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:37,323
I definitely consent to this.

105
00:04:37,615 --> 00:04:39,283
- Okay, awesome.

106
00:04:39,575 --> 00:04:40,409
- Oh wait, wait.

107
00:04:40,701 --> 00:04:42,077
You know, you had a couple drinks too.

108
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:43,329
Are you able to consent?

109
00:04:43,621 --> 00:04:45,539
'Cause guys can get
taken advantage of too.

110
00:04:45,873 --> 00:04:47,500
- Yes, yes I can.

111
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:51,253
And babe, thank you
for valuing my consent.

112
00:04:54,173 --> 00:04:54,965
Wait.

113
00:04:55,257 --> 00:04:56,717
You know, just to be safe.

114
00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:01,263
Can you tilt your head
back and touch your nose?

115
00:05:01,555 --> 00:05:02,097
Okay.

116
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:02,890
- Okay.

117
00:05:03,182 --> 00:05:03,891
- Let's do this.

118
00:05:04,183 --> 00:05:04,892
- Okay.

119
00:05:06,018 --> 00:05:06,685
Okay wait, you know what?

120
00:05:06,977 --> 00:05:07,561
Just one more thing.

121
00:05:07,853 --> 00:05:09,271
To be 100% positive let's both

122
00:05:09,563 --> 00:05:12,233
say the alphabet together backwards.

123
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:16,237
- Z-Y-X, W-V-U, T-S-R, Q,
- Z-Y-X, W-V-U, T-S-R, Q,

124
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:19,740
- P-O-N, M-L-K, J-l-H, G,
- P-O-N, M-L-K, J-l-H, G,

125
00:05:20,032 --> 00:05:21,909
- F-E-D, C-B-A.
- F-E-D, C-B-A.

126
00:05:22,201 --> 00:05:24,954
- Great, so we're both def
sober and able to consent.

127
00:05:25,246 --> 00:05:26,831
- Let's have some intercourse.

128
00:05:27,122 --> 00:05:28,958
- Okay, this is so hot.

129
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,712
- Why'd you turn the light on?

130
00:05:34,004 --> 00:05:35,464
- I didn't, I thought you did.

131
00:05:35,756 --> 00:05:37,091
(ominous music)

132
00:05:37,383 --> 00:05:39,844
(couple gasps)

133
00:05:54,608 --> 00:05:55,734
- I can't believe two people

134
00:05:56,026 --> 00:05:58,279
were murdered in this very garage.

135
00:05:58,571 --> 00:06:00,030
It's just so, so...

136
00:06:00,322 --> 00:06:00,906
- Crazy.

137
00:06:01,198 --> 00:06:01,740
- Hot.

138
00:06:02,032 --> 00:06:02,867
- What?

139
00:06:03,158 --> 00:06:04,410
- Yeah, like what if their ghosts

140
00:06:04,702 --> 00:06:06,620
are like trapped in this garage?

141
00:06:06,912 --> 00:06:09,081
You know, like for all eternity.

142
00:06:09,373 --> 00:06:12,084
What if they're watching us right now?

143
00:06:12,376 --> 00:06:13,043
I want some dick.

144
00:06:13,335 --> 00:06:13,878
Pull it out.

145
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:15,421
- Okay, sure.

146
00:06:15,713 --> 00:06:17,506
You know, I don't want anyone watching,

147
00:06:17,798 --> 00:06:20,551
but who am I to refuse a little head?

148
00:06:20,843 --> 00:06:22,136
- Oh my god, you're uncircumcised?

149
00:06:22,428 --> 00:06:23,220
- Yeah, it's not a problem is it?

150
00:06:23,512 --> 00:06:24,513
- No, it's the best.

151
00:06:24,805 --> 00:06:25,806
We can dock dicks.

152
00:06:26,098 --> 00:06:26,724
- Oh, okay.

153
00:06:27,016 --> 00:06:27,600
Yeah, we can do that.

154
00:06:27,892 --> 00:06:28,392
- Yeah.

155
00:06:28,684 --> 00:06:29,184
- Okay, sure.

156
00:06:29,476 --> 00:06:30,060
- Go dick tip to dick tip.

157
00:06:30,352 --> 00:06:31,979
Now pull your foreskin over.

158
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:33,022
Oh fuck.

159
00:06:34,231 --> 00:06:35,357
We're docked.

160
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:36,233
We're docked!

161
00:06:36,525 --> 00:06:37,109
- Yes, fuck.

162
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:38,861
- Oh fuck yeah.

163
00:06:39,153 --> 00:06:40,529
Oh fuck.

164
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:41,572
Oh yeah.

165
00:06:42,615 --> 00:06:45,951
- (sarcastically) Yeah, oh yeah.

166
00:06:46,243 --> 00:06:46,911
Can we fuck?

167
00:06:47,202 --> 00:06:48,078
Can you fuck me?

168
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:49,955
I could turn around or something.

169
00:06:50,247 --> 00:06:51,123
- No no no, we are fucking.

170
00:06:51,415 --> 00:06:51,999
- We're fucking?

171
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:53,292
- Dick hole to dick hole.

172
00:06:53,584 --> 00:06:54,168
Cock on cock.

173
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,586
It's like our souls are touching.

174
00:06:55,878 --> 00:06:56,921
Oh my god, now look me in the eye.

175
00:06:57,212 --> 00:06:58,380
Look me in the eye.

176
00:06:58,672 --> 00:06:59,590
No no, don't blink!

177
00:06:59,882 --> 00:07:00,591
Don't blink, it'll go soft!

178
00:07:00,883 --> 00:07:01,467
- Okay, yeah.

179
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,551
Yeah, okay.

180
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,094
- Oh yeah.

181
00:07:04,386 --> 00:07:04,929
- Okay.

182
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:05,804
- Fuck yeah.

183
00:07:06,138 --> 00:07:08,265
(dramatic sting)

184
00:07:08,557 --> 00:07:11,685
(nail gun firing)
(loud squish)

185
00:07:11,977 --> 00:07:12,603
- Our dicks!

186
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,313
There's a nail through our dicks!

187
00:07:14,605 --> 00:07:15,773
- Who the fuck is that?

188
00:07:16,106 --> 00:07:17,775
(guys scream)

189
00:07:18,067 --> 00:07:18,943
- No don't pull away!

190
00:07:19,234 --> 00:07:20,194
You're pulling my dick!

191
00:07:20,486 --> 00:07:25,366
(guys screaming)
(warped music)

192
00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:33,248
(loud squish)

193
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,291
No, please, stop!

194
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:35,501
Don't, no no no, please!

195
00:07:35,793 --> 00:07:36,418
Why are you doing this?

196
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:37,252
My dick!

197
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:38,504
My beautiful beautiful dick!

198
00:07:38,796 --> 00:07:39,463
Please don't!

199
00:07:39,755 --> 00:07:40,589
(nail gun firing)

200
00:07:40,923 --> 00:07:42,758
- No, no, no no no no no.

201
00:07:45,678 --> 00:07:46,971
(sobs) Why?

202
00:07:47,262 --> 00:07:49,181
(nail gun firing)

203
00:07:49,556 --> 00:07:52,142
(ominous music)

204
00:08:07,616 --> 00:08:09,618
- Zed's been gone for a
really long time, right?

205
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,162
I mean how long does it take
to get beers from the basement?

206
00:08:12,454 --> 00:08:14,331
- I mean he's probably just
fucking around down there.

207
00:08:14,623 --> 00:08:15,249
Who cares?

208
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:16,792
We don't need beer anyway!

209
00:08:17,084 --> 00:08:19,837
Because I got us a bottle of wine.

210
00:08:21,922 --> 00:08:22,673
Yep.

211
00:08:23,841 --> 00:08:25,092
Wine is the best.

212
00:08:25,384 --> 00:08:26,385
(Greg laughs)

213
00:08:26,677 --> 00:08:28,345
You know, I took a class trip

214
00:08:28,637 --> 00:08:31,390
with the French club to Paris.

215
00:08:31,682 --> 00:08:33,100
Back in high school, so I know

216
00:08:33,392 --> 00:08:35,477
a little bit about the ol' vino there.

217
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:37,730
(suspense music)

218
00:08:38,022 --> 00:08:38,772
Yeah.

219
00:08:39,064 --> 00:08:41,442
You know you can't just
use regular grapes?

220
00:08:41,734 --> 00:08:43,068
Oh this is an excellent vintage.

221
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,445
Yeah, you gotta get special grapes.

222
00:08:44,737 --> 00:08:45,738
Not everybody knows that.

223
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,739
You know?

224
00:08:47,698 --> 00:08:48,490
So.

225
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,163
It really is a drink for
more sophisticated people.

226
00:08:54,455 --> 00:08:55,914
Good thing we are they.

227
00:08:56,206 --> 00:08:56,874
Right?

228
00:08:57,207 --> 00:08:57,958
Right babe?

229
00:09:06,508 --> 00:09:07,259
Hannah?

230
00:09:09,803 --> 00:09:11,555
Hannah where'd you go?

231
00:09:16,268 --> 00:09:18,854
(ominous music)

232
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,001
Hannah?

233
00:09:41,293 --> 00:09:42,461
You down there?

234
00:09:51,261 --> 00:09:55,265
This isn't one of Zed's
dumb little tricks is it?

235
00:09:56,433 --> 00:09:58,560
'Cause I'm not falling for that.

236
00:09:58,852 --> 00:09:59,645
I've been to Paris.

237
00:09:59,978 --> 00:10:00,729
You can't fool me.

238
00:10:01,021 --> 00:10:02,856
(chuckles) Come on.

239
00:10:03,148 --> 00:10:03,816
All right guys, come on.

240
00:10:04,108 --> 00:10:04,858
Stop.

241
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,610
Stop playing games.

242
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:09,029
Just opened this wine.

243
00:10:09,321 --> 00:10:12,199
We gotta drink it before it expires.

244
00:10:14,868 --> 00:10:16,453
Come on, guys.

245
00:10:16,745 --> 00:10:17,913
Where'd you go?

246
00:10:18,205 --> 00:10:19,581
Oh, this guy.

247
00:10:19,873 --> 00:10:22,835
Fucking hiding in the corner, man.

248
00:10:23,127 --> 00:10:24,461
Oh my God!

249
00:10:24,753 --> 00:10:26,046
What the fuck?

250
00:10:26,338 --> 00:10:27,589
Oh shit!

251
00:10:27,881 --> 00:10:28,674
Oh my god!

252
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:31,635
Oh my god.

253
00:10:31,927 --> 00:10:34,972
(haunting choir melody)

254
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:39,393
(Greg screams)

255
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:53,782
Oh, okay.

256
00:10:54,116 --> 00:10:56,410
(Greg screams)

257
00:11:01,373 --> 00:11:04,960
- All my friends and
acquaintances are dead!

258
00:11:05,878 --> 00:11:08,380
(Greg screams)

259
00:11:10,382 --> 00:11:11,300
Man, who are you?

260
00:11:11,592 --> 00:11:12,843
Why are you doing this?

261
00:11:13,177 --> 00:11:14,428
No!

262
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,429
Stop!

263
00:11:16,346 --> 00:11:17,055
No, stop, no!

264
00:11:17,347 --> 00:11:17,973
Please don't!

265
00:11:18,265 --> 00:11:19,391
No, please don't!

266
00:11:19,683 --> 00:11:20,350
Please don't.

267
00:11:20,642 --> 00:11:21,351
What are you doing?

268
00:11:21,643 --> 00:11:22,644
Don't do this!

269
00:11:23,812 --> 00:11:25,397
Don't do this!

270
00:11:25,689 --> 00:11:26,732
Don't do this!

271
00:11:27,858 --> 00:11:29,109
No, please don't!

272
00:11:29,443 --> 00:11:30,068
Please don't!

273
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,111
Please don't.

274
00:11:31,403 --> 00:11:31,945
Dude.

275
00:11:32,237 --> 00:11:33,947
Dude, dude, you're not doing it right.

276
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:36,116
You gotta, you're pressing way too hard.

277
00:11:36,408 --> 00:11:37,951
You just gotta hold it firm.

278
00:11:38,243 --> 00:11:40,287
Hold it firm, but glide
it with your wrist.

279
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:42,289
Use more wrist.

280
00:11:42,581 --> 00:11:43,165
Glide.

281
00:11:43,457 --> 00:11:43,999
Glide it.

282
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:44,833
Strike it.

283
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:45,667
Yeah.

284
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:46,877
No.

285
00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:49,213
Make it count 'cause you're
running out of matches.

286
00:11:49,504 --> 00:11:50,547
Okay?

287
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:51,548
Come on.

288
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,758
Oop, there goes your match.

289
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:53,800
There's your last one.

290
00:11:54,092 --> 00:11:55,260
You didn't get it.

291
00:11:55,552 --> 00:11:57,888
(Greg laughs)

292
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:07,648
No.

293
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,482
Oh no.

294
00:12:08,774 --> 00:12:09,441
No.

295
00:12:09,733 --> 00:12:10,317
No!

296
00:12:10,609 --> 00:12:11,109
No!

297
00:12:11,401 --> 00:12:12,027
No!

298
00:12:16,073 --> 00:12:17,366

302

- [Reporter] That was the scene last night

303
00:12:34,549 --> 00:12:36,635
as a house in Long Island
was burned to the ground.

304
00:12:36,927 --> 00:12:38,345
Investigators found the bodies

305
00:12:38,637 --> 00:12:40,889
of seven people believed
to have been murdered.

306
00:12:41,223 --> 00:12:43,308
This is the same house
that had been the scene

307
00:12:43,642 --> 00:12:46,311
of the Long Island Slashening
just five years earlier.

308
00:12:46,645 --> 00:12:48,480
So far authorities have no suspects.

309
00:12:48,772 --> 00:12:51,817
- (singsong) Madison.

310
00:12:59,866 --> 00:13:00,617
Madison.

311
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:07,916
How are you?

312
00:13:10,794 --> 00:13:12,546
I heard the news.

313
00:13:12,838 --> 00:13:13,672
- I'm fine.

314
00:13:18,427 --> 00:13:19,219
No I'm not.

315
00:13:22,681 --> 00:13:25,517
This just brings up a
lot of bad memories, so.

316
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:27,853
- The past is the past, girl.

317
00:13:28,186 --> 00:13:30,397
You can't keep living it.

318
00:13:30,689 --> 00:13:32,482
Try living here.

319
00:13:32,774 --> 00:13:33,525
Now.

320
00:13:35,444 --> 00:13:40,365
You moved in two months ago
and you still haven't unpacked.

321
00:13:40,824 --> 00:13:43,535
- It's just really hard to let go.

322
00:13:49,374 --> 00:13:53,128
- You wanna know why they
called today the present?

323
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,171
Because.

324
00:13:55,714 --> 00:13:58,925
(whispers) It's a gift.

325
00:14:05,766 --> 00:14:09,519
- There might be someone
who could maybe help.

326
00:14:13,982 --> 00:14:14,691
- Welcome.

327
00:14:15,776 --> 00:14:16,485
I'm Pat.

328
00:14:17,444 --> 00:14:18,987
I see some new faces here.

329
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,114
And a few old friends.

330
00:14:21,406 --> 00:14:23,825
But we're all here for one reason.

331
00:14:24,117 --> 00:14:25,452
To heal.

332
00:14:25,744 --> 00:14:26,495
Together.

333
00:14:27,746 --> 00:14:31,917
And the first step in that
process is sharing our stories.

334
00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:34,586
To break the ice, I'll start.

335
00:14:36,546 --> 00:14:37,714
I was one of the few survivors

336
00:14:38,006 --> 00:14:40,133
of the Long Island Slashening.

337
00:14:40,425 --> 00:14:42,219
I saw most of my friends
brutally murdered,

338
00:14:42,511 --> 00:14:45,180
had scalding hot water
poured all over my face,

339
00:14:45,472 --> 00:14:47,432
my left eye ripped out of my skull,

340
00:14:47,724 --> 00:14:50,560
my penis severed and shoved in my mouth.

341
00:14:50,852 --> 00:14:52,604
But I'm alive, dangit.

342
00:14:54,064 --> 00:14:56,316
And I'm a better man for it.

343
00:14:56,608 --> 00:14:57,275
- I'm Scott.

344
00:14:57,567 --> 00:14:59,736
(chuckles nervously)

345
00:15:00,028 --> 00:15:04,866
I've had some problems with
substances and stuff like that.

346
00:15:06,868 --> 00:15:08,328
My dad did too, so.

347
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,541
But now I'm learning how to channel

348
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,961
all that negative energy into my music.

349
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,506
It's great, man.

350
00:15:19,798 --> 00:15:20,966
- I'm Link.

351
00:15:21,258 --> 00:15:24,344
And yeah, life seemed pretty all right.

352
00:15:26,012 --> 00:15:26,930
Or whatever.

353
00:15:27,931 --> 00:15:32,477
And then one day I was like
what if this is all a dream?

354
00:15:33,728 --> 00:15:34,855
You know?

355
00:15:35,147 --> 00:15:38,442
Like, how do we know what's really real?

356
00:15:39,568 --> 00:15:40,485
Or not real.

357
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:44,239
And it's like whoa.

358
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:46,199
- So I'm Viv.

359
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:48,869
- And I'm Bex.

360
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:50,620
- And we're here by court order.

361
00:15:50,912 --> 00:15:52,080
- For something stupid.

362
00:15:52,372 --> 00:15:53,206
- So stupid.

363
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,000
- Vehicular homicide?

364
00:15:55,292 --> 00:15:56,835
- It sounds like we killed a car.

365
00:15:57,127 --> 00:15:58,628
- Yeah, instead of an
old man who didn't know

366
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,173
how to look both ways
before crossing the street.

367
00:16:01,465 --> 00:16:02,757
- It's all Trent's fault.

368
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:03,633
- Fuck Trent!

369
00:16:03,925 --> 00:16:04,843
- Fuck him hard.

370
00:16:05,135 --> 00:16:06,303
- So hard.

371
00:16:06,595 --> 00:16:08,096
- Trent dared us to go down on each other

372
00:16:08,388 --> 00:16:09,347
while we were driving.

373
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:10,807
- Which is really hard to do.

374
00:16:11,099 --> 00:16:13,518
- So of course we couldn't
see where we were going.

375
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:14,352
- Duh!

376
00:16:14,644 --> 00:16:15,228
- Duh!

377
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,396
- Trent should be the one
going to these meetings.

378
00:16:16,688 --> 00:16:17,230
Not us.

379
00:16:17,522 --> 00:16:19,816
- Instead he's "in a coma".

380
00:16:20,108 --> 00:16:20,734
- Lucky.

381
00:16:21,026 --> 00:16:22,569
- He's so lucky.

382
00:16:22,861 --> 00:16:23,945
- My dad's a lawyer and he fixed it

383
00:16:24,237 --> 00:16:25,864
so instead of jail we
had to go to counseling.

384
00:16:26,156 --> 00:16:28,116
- We shouldn't have to do anything.

385
00:16:28,408 --> 00:16:29,743
We said we were sorry.

386
00:16:30,076 --> 00:16:31,536
- And we meant it.

387
00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:33,413
- Your dad is a shitty lawyer.

388
00:16:33,705 --> 00:16:34,873
- So shitty, I hate him.

389
00:16:35,165 --> 00:16:38,835
- Now I personally have
never felt any sort of grief.

390
00:16:39,127 --> 00:16:40,462
Ever.

391
00:16:40,754 --> 00:16:42,005
And that's just one of the privileges

392
00:16:42,297 --> 00:16:44,799
of being a privileged cis white male.

393
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:47,135
But I understand that my kind has created

394
00:16:47,427 --> 00:16:49,262
nothing but damage in this world.

395
00:16:49,554 --> 00:16:52,599
Which is why I am here to understand.

396
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,936
And to listen and to be with you.

397
00:16:56,228 --> 00:16:58,146
So ladies in particular.

398
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:04,194
If you ever need to talk,
I've got two good ears.

399
00:17:04,486 --> 00:17:06,446
And I'm not gonna listen to you.

400
00:17:06,738 --> 00:17:07,781
No.

401
00:17:08,073 --> 00:17:09,699
I'm gonna hear you.

402
00:17:10,033 --> 00:17:11,201
Because that's the only way we're going

403
00:17:11,493 --> 00:17:14,204
to make this world a better place.

404
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:16,706
By the way, I'm Dylan.

405
00:17:16,998 --> 00:17:17,707
- I'm Cher.

406
00:17:17,999 --> 00:17:20,168
And when I was six years old my family

407
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:23,672
was murdered on Christmas morning.

408
00:17:23,964 --> 00:17:27,133
I found their bodies
surrounded by presents.

409
00:17:27,425 --> 00:17:30,595
Of which my sister got more than I did.

410
00:17:31,888 --> 00:17:34,808
Anyway, no killer was ever found.

411
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,435
After that I spent four
years at an orphanage

412
00:17:37,727 --> 00:17:40,772
where I was picked on on a daily basis.

413
00:17:42,315 --> 00:17:45,235
And then everyone there
was murdered except for me.

414
00:17:45,527 --> 00:17:48,321
In the same violent fashion as my family.

415
00:17:48,613 --> 00:17:51,908
And after that, I just
went from place to place,

416
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,120
unsolved murder after unsolved murder.

417
00:17:56,413 --> 00:17:57,706
Until I met Pat.

418
00:18:01,001 --> 00:18:04,170
You know, Pat really
really helped me open up.

419
00:18:04,504 --> 00:18:09,426
And he is the only person in
this world that I don't hate.

420
00:18:10,176 --> 00:18:14,097
And if anyone ever
tried to hurt Pat, well.

421
00:18:14,389 --> 00:18:15,223
I would.

422
00:18:15,557 --> 00:18:17,726
I would, I would, I would...

423
00:18:19,102 --> 00:18:22,814
I would take the Christmas
lights off the Christmas tree

424
00:18:23,106 --> 00:18:26,568
and I would strangle
that person really tight.

425
00:18:26,901 --> 00:18:30,238
And then I would hang 'em
by the evergreen bell.

426
00:18:30,572 --> 00:18:34,242
And then I'd take the tree
and the star off the tree

427
00:18:34,576 --> 00:18:37,537
and I would cut 'em from
neck to naval and just

428
00:18:37,829 --> 00:18:41,458
watch the blood just gushing
down onto the carpet.

429
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,375
Or-

430
00:18:42,667 --> 00:18:43,251
- Uh, Cher?

431
00:18:43,543 --> 00:18:44,377
- Yeah?

432
00:18:44,669 --> 00:18:45,378
- Cher.

433
00:18:46,713 --> 00:18:47,297
- Oh yeah.

434
00:18:47,589 --> 00:18:48,298
Sorry.

435
00:18:49,883 --> 00:18:50,634
- I'm Ben.

436
00:18:51,968 --> 00:18:52,719
My son...

437
00:18:55,764 --> 00:18:58,975
I lost my son to an act of violence.

438
00:18:59,267 --> 00:19:02,395
(dramatic music)

439
00:19:02,687 --> 00:19:04,481
He was my world, he was my whole...

440
00:19:04,773 --> 00:19:06,232
I'm not ready to do this right now, okay?

441
00:19:06,524 --> 00:19:07,859
I'm not, I can't.

442
00:19:08,151 --> 00:19:09,152
- Are you sure, dude?

443
00:19:09,444 --> 00:19:10,111
- Sure of what?

444
00:19:10,403 --> 00:19:14,240
- Like, are you sure that your son died?

445
00:19:14,532 --> 00:19:16,993
Or like, that you ever even had a son?

446
00:19:17,285 --> 00:19:19,829
You know, like what if you dreamed it?

447
00:19:20,121 --> 00:19:23,291
You know, it's like perception is reality.

448
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:24,250
You know?

449
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,878
- Fuck.

450
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:27,796
You.

451
00:19:28,088 --> 00:19:30,548
- Hey, why don't we move along?

452
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,217
- Hi, I am Madison.

453
00:19:33,885 --> 00:19:38,264
I also have a history with
the Long Island Slashening.

454
00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:43,520
My dad owned a pizza place.

455
00:19:43,812 --> 00:19:44,979
It was pretty successful.

456
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:47,440
It's fun, it's like a family thing.

457
00:19:47,732 --> 00:19:49,317
And then one night he sent

458
00:19:49,609 --> 00:19:52,362
a delivery boy out to deliver a pizza.

459
00:19:52,654 --> 00:19:55,365
And the delivery boy did not come back

460
00:19:55,657 --> 00:19:57,951
and dad just thought like okay,

461
00:19:58,243 --> 00:20:00,161
he probably quit or something,

462
00:20:00,453 --> 00:20:02,497
or like doesn't wanna work here anymore.

463
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:04,332
Whatever reason, he didn't come back.

464
00:20:04,624 --> 00:20:07,460
So he sent out another delivery boy.

465
00:20:08,461 --> 00:20:10,088
But then the same thing happened.

466
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,048
That boy didn't come back and so my dad

467
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,342
sent out another one and another one

468
00:20:14,634 --> 00:20:17,137
until he had sent out his whole staff.

469
00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:20,181
And all of them had been murdered.

470
00:20:23,727 --> 00:20:25,729
And that was really hard for him.

471
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:29,065
He kind of fell into a really
deep depression after that.

472
00:20:29,357 --> 00:20:30,567
It kind of ruined him.

473
00:20:30,859 --> 00:20:32,902
(dramatic acoustic melody)

474
00:20:33,194 --> 00:20:36,948
One day I like came home
early from school and.

475
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,324
(gunshot fires)

476
00:20:38,616 --> 00:20:40,910
(loud ringing)

477
00:20:44,205 --> 00:20:48,585
He angled it wrong, so it
like went through his cheek.

478
00:20:48,877 --> 00:20:51,045
But him kind of like missing

479
00:20:51,337 --> 00:20:54,257
made him become even more depressed.

480
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,219
(Madison knocks)

481
00:20:58,511 --> 00:20:59,971
(doorknob jiggles)

482
00:21:00,263 --> 00:21:02,640
(knocking and jiggling)

483
00:21:02,974 --> 00:21:04,726
(loud ringing)

484
00:21:05,018 --> 00:21:09,272
He like went across the street
instead of down the street.

485
00:21:09,564 --> 00:21:11,775
So that actually gave
me enough time to get

486
00:21:12,066 --> 00:21:16,070
an ambulance to come and
save him, save his life.

487
00:21:16,362 --> 00:21:20,325
But I think that really
made him hit rock bottom.

488
00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:28,875
- Walked in on him trying to take

489
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:31,753
all of my UTI  prescription meds.

490
00:21:34,589 --> 00:21:35,924
But then one day.

491
00:21:40,011 --> 00:21:41,429
- He hung himself?

492
00:21:43,181 --> 00:21:43,932
- Sort of?

493
00:21:45,099 --> 00:21:47,852
(sexual moaning)

494
00:21:48,186 --> 00:21:50,772
Autoerotic asphyxiation had given him

495
00:21:51,064 --> 00:21:54,943
a new love of life if
you believe it or not.

496
00:21:55,276 --> 00:21:58,863
So he actually wasn't depressed anymore.

497
00:21:59,155 --> 00:22:01,616
He had really found like
what made him happy.

498
00:22:01,908 --> 00:22:02,700
- Ew.
- Ew.

499
00:22:04,244 --> 00:22:05,495
- Thanks, girls.

500
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,499
- Hey, Madison right?

501
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:10,375
- Yeah.

502
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:11,334
- Oh cool.

503
00:22:11,626 --> 00:22:12,710
Just so you know.

504
00:22:13,002 --> 00:22:14,879
If you ever want to talk
about those feelings

505
00:22:15,171 --> 00:22:16,965
that you were kind of getting into today

506
00:22:17,257 --> 00:22:19,968
and grab a cup of
coffee, I'm totally down.

507
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:20,802
- Oh, cool.

508
00:22:21,094 --> 00:22:21,594
Thank you.

509
00:22:21,886 --> 00:22:22,470
- Yeah, no problem.

510
00:22:22,762 --> 00:22:23,304
Hey, great session.

511
00:22:23,596 --> 00:22:24,722
- Oh, thanks.

512
00:22:25,014 --> 00:22:25,598
- Yeah, see you.

513
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:26,599
- Bye.

514
00:22:27,642 --> 00:22:29,894
- So not too bad, right?

515
00:22:30,186 --> 00:22:31,771
- No, this place is great.

516
00:22:32,063 --> 00:22:33,565
- Yeah, it used to be a methadone clinic

517
00:22:33,898 --> 00:22:35,316
before they cleaned up the neighborhood

518
00:22:35,608 --> 00:22:38,695
and now it's a place that helps people.

519
00:22:40,905 --> 00:22:43,575
- It wasn't easy talking
about my dad today.

520
00:22:43,867 --> 00:22:44,617
- Yeah.

521
00:22:45,869 --> 00:22:48,538
- So, hey, if you want to go grab coffee

522
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,373
and talk about some
more of those feelings-

523
00:22:50,665 --> 00:22:51,708
- Fuck off!

524
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,750
- But I'm glad I did.

525
00:22:53,042 --> 00:22:54,085
- Great session.

526
00:22:54,377 --> 00:22:56,921
- Yeah, you know, talking helps.

527
00:22:58,047 --> 00:23:00,341
Without a great support
system I don't know

528
00:23:00,633 --> 00:23:03,553
how I would've ever
gotten over my, you know.

529
00:23:03,845 --> 00:23:04,679
- Castration.

530
00:23:04,971 --> 00:23:05,471
- Yeah.

531
00:23:05,763 --> 00:23:06,347
- And losing your eye.

532
00:23:06,639 --> 00:23:07,432
- Also yeah.

533
00:23:09,183 --> 00:23:11,477
- So ladies, what are you up to later?

534
00:23:11,769 --> 00:23:12,312
Do you wanna-

535
00:23:12,645 --> 00:23:14,522
- Fuck off!
- Fuck off!

536
00:23:14,814 --> 00:23:15,481
- All right, great session.

537
00:23:15,773 --> 00:23:16,649
I'll see you next week.

538
00:23:16,941 --> 00:23:20,737
- Anyway, I feel like we're
kind of bonded in a way.

539
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:24,073
Both affected by same tragedy, you know?

540
00:23:24,365 --> 00:23:24,991
- Right.

541
00:23:25,283 --> 00:23:26,868
Yeah, I guess we are.

542
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,620
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

543
00:23:28,912 --> 00:23:31,664
- If you ever need to talk
even outside of the group,

544
00:23:31,956 --> 00:23:33,333
you know, you can always give me-

545
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:34,334
- Pat!

546
00:23:35,251 --> 00:23:37,337
I'm feeling emotional.

547
00:23:37,629 --> 00:23:38,296
Comfort me now.

548
00:23:38,588 --> 00:23:39,255
- Oh yeah, of course.

549
00:23:39,547 --> 00:23:40,089
Right away.

550
00:23:40,381 --> 00:23:41,299
Hey, talk later?

551
00:23:41,591 --> 00:23:42,425
- Yeah, I'd appreciate that.

552
00:23:42,717 --> 00:23:43,301
- Great.

553
00:23:43,593 --> 00:23:44,302
- Thanks.

554
00:23:46,888 --> 00:23:47,472
- Hey.

555
00:23:47,805 --> 00:23:48,723
- Oh hey.

556
00:23:49,057 --> 00:23:53,144
- My band's playing a show
tonight if anybody wants to come.

557
00:23:53,436 --> 00:23:54,479
It'd be great to see you there.

558
00:23:54,771 --> 00:23:55,647
- Oh, cool.

559
00:23:55,939 --> 00:23:56,814
Cool.

560
00:23:57,106 --> 00:23:57,690
- All right.

561
00:23:57,982 --> 00:23:58,566
- All right.

562
00:23:58,858 --> 00:23:59,400
Bye.

563
00:23:59,692 --> 00:24:00,360
See you.

564
00:24:01,861 --> 00:24:04,697
(foreboding music)

565
00:24:08,826 --> 00:24:11,829
- So what's good with your rock star?

566
00:24:13,331 --> 00:24:14,499
- I don't know.

567
00:24:15,917 --> 00:24:17,502
He seems nice.

568
00:24:17,794 --> 00:24:18,628
Very sweet.

569
00:24:19,879 --> 00:24:20,672
Very sweet.

570
00:24:22,173 --> 00:24:24,676
- So you gonna hit up his show?

571
00:24:26,678 --> 00:24:27,887
- I don't know.

572
00:24:28,179 --> 00:24:31,641
I mean there's so many things
going on in my head right now.

573
00:24:31,933 --> 00:24:34,727
I don't know if I'm ready
for boys just right now-

574
00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:35,937
- All of it, Madison.

575
00:24:36,229 --> 00:24:36,854
All of it.

576
00:24:37,146 --> 00:24:37,855

578
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,277
All your fears.

579
00:24:44,779 --> 00:24:46,489
Locked up in this jar.

580
00:24:47,949 --> 00:24:50,076
And that jar is your heart.

581
00:24:51,619 --> 00:24:52,829
You just need to find the right man

582
00:24:53,121 --> 00:24:56,207
go ahead and open up that jar for you.

583
00:24:59,836 --> 00:25:02,422
(crowd chatter)

584
00:25:19,647 --> 00:25:21,107
- Oh man, I am so pumped for this show.

585
00:25:21,441 --> 00:25:23,359
I'm the biggest Joe head in the world.

586
00:25:23,693 --> 00:25:24,902
How many of their shows have you been to?

587
00:25:25,194 --> 00:25:26,612
- This is my first one.

588
00:25:26,904 --> 00:25:27,697
- Wow.

589
00:25:27,989 --> 00:25:29,907
Prepare to be blown away.

590
00:25:31,617 --> 00:25:32,326

636
00:28:00,933 --> 00:28:03,519
(ominous sting)

637
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:06,898

00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:07,690
- Hey.

639
00:28:07,982 --> 00:28:08,566
- That was really great.

640
00:28:08,858 --> 00:28:09,734
- Aw, thank you so much for coming.

641
00:28:10,026 --> 00:28:10,568
- Of course.

642
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,444
- I hope you had fun.

643
00:28:11,736 --> 00:28:12,278
- Yeah, I did.

644
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,738
- Sweet.

645
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:16,782
If you want to download some
of our music it's all online.

646
00:28:17,074 --> 00:28:17,658
- Oh, cool.

647
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:18,784
- We got a couple EPs, yeah.

648
00:28:19,076 --> 00:28:19,827
- Yeah, I'll definitely do that.

649
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:20,620
That sounds great.

650
00:28:20,912 --> 00:28:21,662
- Actually, if you're interested

651
00:28:21,954 --> 00:28:25,041
I could give you a discount code.

652
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:25,958
- Yeah.

653
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:26,709
Yes, yeah.

654
00:28:27,001 --> 00:28:27,627
- Cool.

655
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:28,461
- That would be great.

656
00:28:28,753 --> 00:28:29,295
Thank you.

657
00:28:29,587 --> 00:28:30,171
- Great.

658
00:28:30,463 --> 00:28:31,047
- Great.

659
00:28:31,339 --> 00:28:31,881
Okay.

660
00:28:32,173 --> 00:28:32,924
I should probably go.

661
00:28:33,216 --> 00:28:34,634
- Yeah, I gotta go too 'cause my band.

662
00:28:34,926 --> 00:28:36,177
My band, it's all packed up.

663
00:28:36,469 --> 00:28:38,638
- Yeah, gotta get packed.

664
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:39,639
I'll see you-

665
00:28:39,931 --> 00:28:40,431
- I'll see you at the meeting.

666
00:28:40,723 --> 00:28:42,016
- I'll see you at the meeting.

667
00:28:42,308 --> 00:28:42,892
- See ya.

668
00:28:43,184 --> 00:28:43,684
- Okay, see ya.

669
00:28:43,976 --> 00:28:44,644
- Oh no no wait!

670
00:28:44,936 --> 00:28:47,897
I actually, this is a shirt of my band.

671
00:28:49,023 --> 00:28:50,274
For you, yeah.

672
00:28:50,566 --> 00:28:51,651
- Thank you.

673
00:28:51,943 --> 00:28:53,361
That's really nice.

674
00:28:54,654 --> 00:28:55,988
Cool, I'll see you tomorrow, so.

675
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,031
- Yeah, see you tomorrow.

676
00:28:57,323 --> 00:28:57,907
- Okay.

677
00:28:58,199 --> 00:28:58,866
Bye.

678
00:29:00,534 --> 00:29:01,285
- Hey Scott.

679
00:29:01,577 --> 00:29:02,161
- Yeah.

680
00:29:02,453 --> 00:29:04,121
- You ready to go?

681
00:29:04,413 --> 00:29:04,997
- Yeah.

682
00:29:05,289 --> 00:29:06,958
No, actually I forgot my uke.

683
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:07,833
You guys go ahead.

684
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:09,293
I'll catch up to you, okay?

685
00:29:09,585 --> 00:29:10,211
- Okay.

686
00:29:11,963 --> 00:29:14,548
(ominous music)

687
00:29:22,807 --> 00:29:24,267
- Oh, my lucky uke.

688
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,771
(music intensifies)
(Scott screams)

689
00:29:29,063 --> 00:29:29,814
My uke!

690
00:29:51,127 --> 00:29:55,298
- [Dylan] There's some nights
I don't get any sleep at all.

691
00:29:55,589 --> 00:29:57,842
I'm just up all night just looking

692
00:29:58,134 --> 00:29:59,677
at pictures of the two of us.

693
00:29:59,969 --> 00:30:01,887
(low ringing)

694
00:30:02,179 --> 00:30:04,640
I can stare at a picture
for hours, it seems like.

695
00:30:04,932 --> 00:30:07,351
I just don't get tired of it.

696
00:30:07,643 --> 00:30:10,396
I mean in a way I don't
even know why I do it.

697
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,189
I mean it's not like there's any place

698
00:30:12,481 --> 00:30:14,025
I look that I don't see him.

699
00:30:14,317 --> 00:30:15,067
- It's weird, right?

700
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:16,277
That Scott isn't here?

701
00:30:16,569 --> 00:30:18,321
'Cause he said he would be.

702
00:30:18,612 --> 00:30:20,239
- Maybe he just overslept.

703
00:30:20,531 --> 00:30:24,160
You know how crazy that
rock and roll lifestyle is.

704
00:30:24,452 --> 00:30:25,077
- Okay.

705
00:30:25,369 --> 00:30:26,162
(dramatic sting)

706
00:30:26,454 --> 00:30:29,123
Or maybe he just didn't
want to be around you.

707
00:30:29,415 --> 00:30:31,834
- Maybe Scott never really existed.

708
00:30:32,126 --> 00:30:34,045
And is just part of our
collective dream world.

709
00:30:34,337 --> 00:30:34,920
- Shut up.

710
00:30:35,212 --> 00:30:35,880
- Okay.

711
00:30:45,848 --> 00:30:47,767
- Hey, it's seriously so cool of you

712
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:49,560
to come chill with me, man.

713
00:30:49,852 --> 00:30:52,480
I am always asking
people to do DMT with me.

714
00:30:52,813 --> 00:30:55,149
And they're always like
"Shut the fuck up, Link.

715
00:30:55,441 --> 00:30:57,234
"Fuck off and die, Link.

716
00:30:57,526 --> 00:31:00,654
"Hey Link, you know I have
a history of drug addiction.

717
00:31:00,946 --> 00:31:03,699
"Why don't you stop asking
me to get high with you?"

718
00:31:03,991 --> 00:31:07,411
And it's like, it's that
sort of uptight perspective

719
00:31:07,703 --> 00:31:11,749
that needs to experience
DMT the most, you know?

720
00:31:12,041 --> 00:31:15,920
And it's like DMT is
inside every living thing.

721
00:31:17,296 --> 00:31:19,924
It's like sucking your own dick, man.

722
00:31:20,216 --> 00:31:20,966
You know?

723
00:31:21,258 --> 00:31:23,010
I mean it's a part of us.

724
00:31:23,302 --> 00:31:25,304
It's just natural.

725
00:31:25,638 --> 00:31:29,558
Plus people have been
doing DMT for like forever.

726
00:31:31,185 --> 00:31:34,397
The Egyptians, the Aztecs, the Mongols.

727
00:31:35,314 --> 00:31:38,609
Like all the chillest
civilizations throughout history.

728
00:31:38,901 --> 00:31:40,236
They all did DMT.

729
00:31:41,654 --> 00:31:43,823
Until, you know, the 1950s.

730
00:31:45,825 --> 00:31:46,826
When the CIA.

731
00:31:48,911 --> 00:31:50,329
And the FBI.

732
00:31:50,621 --> 00:31:51,580
Hoo boy.

733
00:31:51,914 --> 00:31:54,542
They come along and they make it illegal.

734
00:31:54,834 --> 00:31:59,296
Because they know if people's
eyes are open to the truth,

735
00:31:59,588 --> 00:32:01,674
they're not gonna participate in this

736
00:32:01,966 --> 00:32:05,386
bullshit make believe capitalist economy.

737
00:32:05,678 --> 00:32:06,679
Uh-uh.

738
00:32:06,971 --> 00:32:09,306
They're not gonna buy Cadillacs.

739
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:13,185
They're not gonna wear a
tie to their corporate job.

740
00:32:13,477 --> 00:32:16,647
They're not gonna pay their own rent.

741
00:32:16,939 --> 00:32:17,606
No way.

742
00:32:17,898 --> 00:32:19,483
Not happening.

743
00:32:19,775 --> 00:32:21,360
And here's the other thing.

744
00:32:21,652 --> 00:32:22,862
All of this?

745
00:32:23,154 --> 00:32:24,447
It's all a dream.

746
00:32:25,364 --> 00:32:26,115
All of it.

747
00:32:27,324 --> 00:32:28,492
And it is only.

748
00:32:30,202 --> 00:32:31,704
When we smoke this.

749
00:32:32,663 --> 00:32:35,749
That we truly experience reality.

750
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:38,419
(hip hop music)

751
00:32:56,145 --> 00:32:58,939
(foreboding music)

752
00:32:59,273 --> 00:33:00,024
Huh.

753
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:02,067
You know, this stuff might actually

754
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:05,654
be a little weaker than
I initially thought.

755
00:33:05,946 --> 00:33:08,699
'Cause I'm pretty sure I'm still dreaming.

756
00:33:08,991 --> 00:33:10,701
(dramatic sting)

757
00:33:10,993 --> 00:33:13,871
(grunted screaming)

758
00:33:19,043 --> 00:33:20,794
This is no dream!

759
00:33:21,086 --> 00:33:23,130
This is really happening!

760
00:33:23,464 --> 00:33:25,799
My whole worldview is wrong!

761
00:33:26,091 --> 00:33:27,176
So superficial!

762
00:33:28,636 --> 00:33:30,387
Reality is real!

763
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:32,723
And it fucking sucks shit!

764
00:33:33,933 --> 00:33:38,854
(glass shatters)
(dramatic sting)

765
00:33:40,481 --> 00:33:43,067
(ominous music)

766
00:33:49,573 --> 00:33:52,201
(killer puffing)

767
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,919
- [Pat] To be honest, the
Long Island Slashening,

768
00:34:02,211 --> 00:34:04,213
while a very, very psychologically

769
00:34:04,505 --> 00:34:06,298
traumatic event, did me some favors.

770
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,675
(loud ringing)

771
00:34:07,967 --> 00:34:09,510
Do I miss having a penis?

772
00:34:09,802 --> 00:34:10,511
No.

773
00:34:11,554 --> 00:34:13,764
Because penises can't hug.

774
00:34:14,056 --> 00:34:16,559
- Guys, guys, group therapy announcement.

775
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:19,520
Tonight my friend is
putting on an art show

776
00:34:19,812 --> 00:34:23,857
with this amazing feminist
artist who is also a woman.

777
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:27,486
And we all know how
important it is to not only

778
00:34:27,778 --> 00:34:30,990
really enhance our local
art scene, but especially

779
00:34:31,282 --> 00:34:34,076
for women that are doing
really strong feminist work.

780
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,786
So I can pretty much count on

781
00:34:36,078 --> 00:34:37,830
all of you guys being there right?

782
00:34:38,122 --> 00:34:38,872
- Fuck no.

783
00:34:39,164 --> 00:34:39,957
- We have plans.

784
00:34:40,249 --> 00:34:40,833
- To drink.

785
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:41,667
- And party.

786
00:34:41,959 --> 00:34:42,710
- And dance.

787
00:34:43,002 --> 00:34:44,003
- So fuck you.

788
00:34:44,295 --> 00:34:45,045
- What?

789
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,465
Sorry, girls.

790
00:34:48,757 --> 00:34:51,176
I guess you're not feminists or whatever.

791
00:34:51,468 --> 00:34:53,137
But you guys are cool?

792
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:54,013
- Yeah.

793
00:34:54,305 --> 00:34:55,264
- All right, just mention
my name at the door.

794
00:34:55,556 --> 00:34:58,017
You'll totally get in for free.

795
00:35:01,228 --> 00:35:02,229
- Empowering.

796
00:35:03,188 --> 00:35:03,981
- It's...

797
00:35:06,567 --> 00:35:08,694
I want to say empowering?

798
00:35:08,986 --> 00:35:09,570
- Empowering.

799
00:35:09,862 --> 00:35:10,779
- Empowering.

800
00:35:11,905 --> 00:35:12,615
- It's empowering.

801
00:35:12,906 --> 00:35:13,449
- Empowering.

802
00:35:13,741 --> 00:35:14,283
- Empowering.

803
00:35:14,575 --> 00:35:15,492
- Empowering.

804
00:35:16,493 --> 00:35:18,579
- Empowering.
- Empowering.

805
00:35:24,335 --> 00:35:27,421
- Empowering, yeah.
- Empowering, yeah.

806
00:35:38,432 --> 00:35:40,059
- And it's weird, I've always been

807
00:35:40,351 --> 00:35:43,312
kind of a supporter of women in the arts.

808
00:35:43,604 --> 00:35:44,938
You know, some of my favorite artists

809
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,274
are people like Sophia Delacroix.

810
00:35:47,566 --> 00:35:48,984
You know, that's a woman.

811
00:35:49,276 --> 00:35:50,653
Anne Bennington.

812
00:35:50,944 --> 00:35:52,154
Margarita Munoz.

813
00:35:53,697 --> 00:35:54,657
Isabella Rosinante.

814
00:35:54,948 --> 00:35:56,200
Those are all women.

815
00:35:56,492 --> 00:35:57,701
And that's cool.

816
00:35:57,993 --> 00:35:59,953
- This is more an expression

817
00:36:00,245 --> 00:36:02,748
of femininity or vulvic strength.

818
00:36:04,792 --> 00:36:06,794
Which a lot of men find intimidating.

819
00:36:07,086 --> 00:36:08,962
Not me, other men.

820
00:36:09,254 --> 00:36:11,340
- It's just so rare that we get

821
00:36:11,632 --> 00:36:14,134
to let women speak, you know?

822
00:36:14,426 --> 00:36:15,094
- Yeah, and-

823
00:36:15,386 --> 00:36:17,846
- And I just think that's
so important that this woman

824
00:36:18,138 --> 00:36:20,933
was able to speak and express herself.

825
00:36:21,225 --> 00:36:23,227
You know what I mean?

826
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:25,771
- So this looks like a flower.

827
00:36:26,063 --> 00:36:28,774
But it's actually a female vagina.

828
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:33,737
- So what this is really is an examination

829
00:36:34,029 --> 00:36:36,615
of the traditional roles of women.

830
00:36:36,907 --> 00:36:40,202
But it's also a subversion of those roles.

831
00:36:41,286 --> 00:36:43,372
It really speaks to the truth that is

832
00:36:43,664 --> 00:36:46,667
the power of our patriarchal society.

833
00:36:49,837 --> 00:36:52,506
- Well this is a really nice space.

834
00:36:52,798 --> 00:36:55,050
- Well it used to be a Dominican church.

835
00:36:55,342 --> 00:36:57,177
Back before they cleaned
the neighborhood up.

836
00:36:57,469 --> 00:36:59,596
Now it's a place where
we can all peacefully

837
00:36:59,888 --> 00:37:02,850
come together, congregate, and learn.

838
00:37:04,351 --> 00:37:05,477
Oh hey!

839
00:37:05,769 --> 00:37:06,687
Everybody, this is Dannon.

840
00:37:06,979 --> 00:37:08,397
She's the one behind the show.

841
00:37:08,689 --> 00:37:09,440
Hello.

842
00:37:09,732 --> 00:37:12,151
- Oh please, I merely
just organized the thing.

843
00:37:12,443 --> 00:37:15,028
All the credit really goes
to this amazing artist.

844
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,157
Everyone, this is Crystal Bluu.

845
00:37:18,449 --> 00:37:19,116
- Wow.

846
00:37:19,408 --> 00:37:20,951
Your work is amazing.

847
00:37:21,994 --> 00:37:23,078
- Yeah, it really is.

848
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:25,205
- Very very powerful.

849
00:37:25,497 --> 00:37:26,165
- I can't even.

850
00:37:26,457 --> 00:37:27,875
There are no words.

851
00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:31,503
- I just like drawing snatch.

852
00:37:31,795 --> 00:37:33,756
- [Dannon] Our Crystal here's
a bit of an outside artist.

853
00:37:34,047 --> 00:37:36,008
- Yeah, I was drawing snatch and like

854
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,051
sculpting snatch and collaging snatch

855
00:37:38,343 --> 00:37:40,512
and people were like you
should sell that shit.

856
00:37:40,804 --> 00:37:42,639
And I was like yeah, I should.

857
00:37:42,931 --> 00:37:44,516
And honestly, it's more fulfilling

858
00:37:44,808 --> 00:37:47,561
than tugging guys off at Alley Cat's.

859
00:37:47,853 --> 00:37:52,107
- Well I'm really glad
you found your calling.

860
00:37:52,399 --> 00:37:53,317
- I just love snatch.

861
00:37:53,609 --> 00:37:54,359
(techno music)

862
00:37:54,651 --> 00:37:56,528
Oh shit, this is my song!

863
00:37:57,988 --> 00:38:00,365
- She's a bit of a free spirit.

864
00:38:00,657 --> 00:38:01,909
- Is she undressing?

865
00:38:02,201 --> 00:38:02,993
- Probably.

866
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,180
She's doing burlesque.

867
00:38:23,472 --> 00:38:25,891
- [Crystal] No, I'm stripping.

868
00:38:35,943 --> 00:38:36,819
- Shut your mouth.

869
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:37,820
Shut up.

870
00:39:07,933 --> 00:39:11,186
- You know, this is really
empowering for women because-

871
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,604
- [Crystal] I'm a dirty slut!

872
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,605
- Oh fuck.

873
00:39:19,987 --> 00:39:21,196
- Whoa, you're not leaving.

874
00:39:21,488 --> 00:39:23,323
Oh my god, this is art!

875
00:39:25,659 --> 00:39:29,121
- I'm hard because of how
she's owning her sexuality.

876
00:39:29,413 --> 00:39:32,332
It's not because of her big titties.

877
00:39:47,556 --> 00:39:50,726
- Well I have to assume that
it's getting pretty late.

878
00:39:51,018 --> 00:39:52,394
- Yeah, very late.

879
00:39:53,687 --> 00:39:56,064
- Yeah, I'm doing a thing in the morning.

880
00:39:56,398 --> 00:39:57,357
- This was great though.

881
00:39:57,649 --> 00:39:58,650
- So great.

882
00:39:58,942 --> 00:39:59,526
- To see your work.

883
00:39:59,818 --> 00:40:00,360
- Thank you.

884
00:40:00,652 --> 00:40:01,361
Let's go.

885
00:40:02,446 --> 00:40:04,615
- Fuck it, I'm leaving too.

886
00:40:17,419 --> 00:40:20,255
(chainsaw revving)

887
00:41:19,481 --> 00:41:20,857
(knife stabbing)

888
00:41:21,149 --> 00:41:24,486
(art show perv gurgling)

889
00:42:16,496 --> 00:42:20,000
- Hey, don't you guys wanna see my snatch?

890
00:42:20,292 --> 00:42:20,876
- No!

891
00:42:21,168 --> 00:42:21,793
- Yes!

892
00:42:22,085 --> 00:42:22,586
- No!

893
00:42:22,878 --> 00:42:23,462
- Yes!

894
00:42:23,754 --> 00:42:24,337
- No!

895
00:42:24,629 --> 00:42:25,338
- [Bex] Yes!

896
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:26,173
- Stop!

897
00:42:26,465 --> 00:42:27,966
- I hate it when you two
fight about politics.

898
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,885
- It's so divisive.

899
00:42:30,177 --> 00:42:30,761
- You're right.

900
00:42:31,053 --> 00:42:32,804
We're all friends here despite

901
00:42:33,096 --> 00:42:36,016
our differing opinions on Palestine.

902
00:42:36,308 --> 00:42:38,810
- Hey, let's agree to disagree.

903
00:42:39,811 --> 00:42:42,147
- [Party Girls] Friends!

904
00:42:42,439 --> 00:42:43,315
- Excuse me.

905
00:42:44,524 --> 00:42:46,318
Ladies, closing time was 15 minutes ago

906
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:48,195
and I really need to lock up.

907
00:42:48,487 --> 00:42:50,822
- But we're not finished
with our wine yet.

908
00:42:51,114 --> 00:42:51,740
- Okay.

909
00:42:52,032 --> 00:42:54,159
When you ordered it I told
you we'd be closing soon

910
00:42:54,451 --> 00:42:56,411
and that you'd have to hurry up.

911
00:42:56,703 --> 00:42:59,998
- I'm sorry that we as
paying customers are enjoying

912
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:02,584
the beverages that we
purchased in your bar.

913
00:43:02,876 --> 00:43:04,044
- Yeah, sorry we're not just

914
00:43:04,336 --> 00:43:06,004
sucking it down like it's malt liquor.

915
00:43:06,296 --> 00:43:06,922
- What the-

916
00:43:07,214 --> 00:43:09,925
- I guess I'll just
have to write a review.

917
00:43:10,217 --> 00:43:11,718
- I'll write one too.

918
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:14,012
- Let's all write reviews.

919
00:43:15,305 --> 00:43:18,600
- [Blonde Girl] How do you
spell "rudest bartender ever"?

920
00:43:18,892 --> 00:43:20,519
- C-U-N-

921
00:43:20,811 --> 00:43:21,520
- Fine!

922
00:43:23,271 --> 00:43:24,022
Fine.

923
00:43:25,941 --> 00:43:27,734
You ladies finish your drinks.

924
00:43:28,026 --> 00:43:30,278
While I go in the back
and clean up or something.

925
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:31,488
- Thank you!

926
00:43:32,572 --> 00:43:33,990
- Some people.

927
00:43:34,282 --> 00:43:36,618
- Do not let her ruin our fun.

928
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:38,537
- This is our night.

929
00:43:39,871 --> 00:43:41,498

(gurgling)

973
00:45:19,262 --> 00:45:21,806
(woman sobbing)

974
00:45:27,687 --> 00:45:28,688
- (sobs) No.

975
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,565
No, no please.

976
00:45:30,857 --> 00:45:33,985
(song playing on phone)

977
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,972
(Viv labored breathing)

978
00:46:06,017 --> 00:46:06,810
- Help!

979
00:46:14,484 --> 00:46:15,068
Mom!

980
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,069
Mom, dad!

981
00:46:18,113 --> 00:46:19,864
Somebody is trying to kill me!

982
00:46:20,156 --> 00:46:22,701
- [Dad] Now why would they do that, Bex?

983
00:46:22,993 --> 00:46:24,369
- For no reason at all!

984
00:46:24,703 --> 00:46:25,870
- [Dad] Honey, we can't constantly

985
00:46:26,162 --> 00:46:29,040
be handling everything
for you all the time.

986
00:46:29,332 --> 00:46:31,501
At some point you need to be a grownup.

987
00:46:31,793 --> 00:46:33,128
Take care of yourself.

988
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:34,921
- I don't know how!

989
00:46:35,213 --> 00:46:37,507
- [Dad] Okay baby, I'll handle this.

990
00:46:37,799 --> 00:46:41,594
And there, I just transferred
$2,000 to your bank account.

991
00:46:41,886 --> 00:46:42,554
Will that help?

992
00:46:42,846 --> 00:46:44,055
- No.

993
00:46:44,347 --> 00:46:45,223
- [Dad] 4,000?

994
00:46:45,515 --> 00:46:46,182
- No.

995
00:46:47,726 --> 00:46:49,311
- [Dad] Maybe 6,000?

996
00:46:50,228 --> 00:46:50,979
- Maybe?

997
00:46:51,271 --> 00:46:55,191
(Bex screams)
(knife stabbing)

998
00:46:55,483 --> 00:46:57,610
- [Dad] Okay, let's make it eight then.

999
00:46:57,902 --> 00:46:59,321
(phone dings)

1000
00:46:59,612 --> 00:47:02,657
(ominous music)

1001
00:47:02,949 --> 00:47:05,201
- All right look, you had...

1002
00:47:09,205 --> 00:47:09,914
Oh shit!

1003
00:47:16,755 --> 00:47:18,673
- This is just terrible.

1004
00:47:19,924 --> 00:47:23,136
Let's take a moment to
remember Viv and Bex.

1005
00:47:23,428 --> 00:47:26,097
(dramatic music)

1006
00:47:28,224 --> 00:47:31,144
Would anyone like to share a memory?

1007
00:47:32,312 --> 00:47:37,025
- I remember one day we went
to the park to get ice cream.

1008
00:47:38,109 --> 00:47:42,572
And the sunshine hit your
eye in such a beautiful way.

1009
00:47:43,782 --> 00:47:47,243
I'll never forget it
for as long as I live.

1010
00:47:49,162 --> 00:47:51,247
- That is a great memory.

1011
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:53,708
Although I meant a
memory about Viv and Bex.

1012
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,335
- Oh, fuck them.

1013
00:47:55,627 --> 00:47:57,253
They sucked and everybody hated them.

1014
00:47:57,545 --> 00:48:01,758
- Admittedly, Viv and Bex were
difficult to get close to.

1015
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:05,178
But we must have empathy for everyone.

1016
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:09,265
Not just people who are nice
or polite or have some shred

1017
00:48:09,557 --> 00:48:12,560
of basic human decency
buried within their bodies.

1018
00:48:12,852 --> 00:48:13,895
- I'm outraged.

1019
00:48:14,187 --> 00:48:16,940
Somebody saw two smart,
strong-willed women

1020
00:48:17,273 --> 00:48:20,485
who didn't conform to what
society deemed appropriate.

1021
00:48:20,777 --> 00:48:24,155
And some scared little man
decided to go and kill them.

1022
00:48:24,447 --> 00:48:25,990
- It was a woman that killed them.

1023
00:48:26,282 --> 00:48:26,991
- Oh, of course.

1024
00:48:27,283 --> 00:48:29,327
A woman who had internalized
so much misogyny

1025
00:48:29,619 --> 00:48:32,038
that she acted according
to the will of man.

1026
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:34,290
I mean, because that's what we do.

1027
00:48:34,582 --> 00:48:38,086
We pit woman against woman
in order to create a chaos-

1028
00:48:38,378 --> 00:48:40,004
- if you don't shut the fuck up

1029
00:48:40,296 --> 00:48:43,299
I'm gonna internalize
my fist into your ass.

1030
00:48:43,591 --> 00:48:47,512
And not in the fun sexy way
like I would do for you, Pat.

1031
00:48:47,804 --> 00:48:52,142
But in the violent way where
I'd pull out your intestines

1032
00:48:52,434 --> 00:48:54,561
and then I'd squeeze the
shit into your mouth,

1033
00:48:54,853 --> 00:48:57,230
making you digest your
shit, and then take a shit

1034
00:48:57,522 --> 00:49:02,235
into your own mouth again in
an endless shit-eating cycle.

1035
00:49:02,527 --> 00:49:03,653
Because fuck you!

1036
00:49:03,945 --> 00:49:04,696
- Okay.

1037
00:49:04,988 --> 00:49:08,533
I can sense that tensions
are running a bit high here,

1038
00:49:08,825 --> 00:49:12,745
so I went ahead and scheduled
a self-defense class

1039
00:49:13,037 --> 00:49:14,789
for the women and I think all the ladies

1040
00:49:15,081 --> 00:49:16,833
should go ahead and take it.

1041
00:49:17,125 --> 00:49:18,293
I think we've learned
that the neighborhood

1042
00:49:18,585 --> 00:49:20,420
has made some progress, but there's still

1043
00:49:20,712 --> 00:49:23,548
an unsavory element, so
I think this would make

1044
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,968
everybody feel just a little bit safer.

1045
00:49:35,268 --> 00:49:36,519
- All right all right all right all right!

1046
00:49:36,811 --> 00:49:40,190
Ladies and other genders,
will you gather around please?

1047
00:49:40,482 --> 00:49:41,608
Okay.

1048
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:45,153
Now after today's lesson,
you will never again

1049
00:49:45,445 --> 00:49:47,739
need to fear for your safety.

1050
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:50,200
Instead, you will only need to fear

1051
00:49:50,492 --> 00:49:53,745
for the safety of anyone
who threatens you.

1052
00:49:54,037 --> 00:49:56,039
Now while I have you here, I'm gonna need

1053
00:49:56,331 --> 00:49:59,375
you all to bow your heads and show respect

1054
00:49:59,667 --> 00:50:02,295
to your Grandmaster, K.M. Swartz!

1055
00:50:03,796 --> 00:50:04,464
Don't clap, bow.

1056
00:50:04,756 --> 00:50:06,132
Bow to your sensei.

1057
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:14,349
- Listen carefully.

1058
00:50:14,682 --> 00:50:16,351
If a man attacks you.

1059
00:50:18,019 --> 00:50:20,146
You punch him in the dick.

1060
00:50:21,189 --> 00:50:23,024
It's as simple as that.

1061
00:50:25,401 --> 00:50:26,528
And it hurts.

1062
00:50:26,819 --> 00:50:29,531
- What if your attacker is a woman?

1063
00:50:29,822 --> 00:50:32,700
- If your attacker is a woman.

1064
00:50:32,992 --> 00:50:34,577
Punch her in the twat.

1065
00:50:34,869 --> 00:50:36,538
I think that hurts also.

1066
00:50:36,829 --> 00:50:37,747
(scattered agreement)

1067
00:50:38,039 --> 00:50:39,290
Now the meter's running in my rickshaw.

1068
00:50:39,582 --> 00:50:41,417
I have to depart.

1069
00:50:41,709 --> 00:50:42,710
Shalom.

1070
00:50:43,002 --> 00:50:43,711
- Shalom.

1071
00:50:53,763 --> 00:50:54,722
- No refunds.

1072
00:50:56,057 --> 00:50:57,684
I do mean no refunds.

1073
00:51:04,774 --> 00:51:06,901
- You live and you learn.

1074
00:51:07,193 --> 00:51:09,195
I learned that you shouldn't
trust that somebody

1075
00:51:09,487 --> 00:51:11,781
is a self-defense expert
just because you found

1076
00:51:12,073 --> 00:51:16,536
their flyer on a bulletin
board in a coffee shop.

1077
00:51:16,828 --> 00:51:17,704
Stupid Pat.

1078
00:51:19,497 --> 00:51:21,457
Anyway, silver lining.

1079
00:51:21,749 --> 00:51:24,919
Tonight is the third annual Spoon-A-Thon.

1080
00:51:25,211 --> 00:51:25,920
Yeah.

1081
00:51:28,172 --> 00:51:30,174
In case you've been living under a rock,

1082
00:51:30,466 --> 00:51:32,010
the Spoon-A-Thon is a big get together

1083
00:51:32,302 --> 00:51:35,221
where people gather and spoon each other.

1084
00:51:35,513 --> 00:51:36,681
Nothing sexual.

1085
00:51:36,973 --> 00:51:39,434
Just a way for people to feel the comfort

1086
00:51:39,726 --> 00:51:41,728
and warmth of a relationship without any

1087
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:44,397
of the negative aspects
of the relationship

1088
00:51:44,689 --> 00:51:47,900
like lust or making your partner orgasm.

1089
00:51:49,902 --> 00:51:53,239
Anyway, I think it's something
that we all need right now.

1090
00:51:53,531 --> 00:51:55,450
I hope to see you there.

1091
00:52:01,331 --> 00:52:02,582
- I'm just so lost.

1092
00:52:02,874 --> 00:52:05,543
- No, there's no such thing as lost.

1093
00:52:05,835 --> 00:52:08,630
Wherever you are is where you are.

1094
00:52:11,466 --> 00:52:12,467
- But I'm 23.

1095
00:52:16,638 --> 00:52:18,389
And I don't know where I'm going.

1096
00:52:18,681 --> 00:52:21,851
- There's only one direction you can go.

1097
00:52:23,144 --> 00:52:23,895
Look.

1098
00:52:27,315 --> 00:52:28,066
Forward.

1099
00:52:32,445 --> 00:52:34,155
- (sobs) I don't know who I am anymore.

1100
00:52:34,447 --> 00:52:35,531
- You are you.

1101
00:52:38,785 --> 00:52:41,120
And that's all anyone can be.

1102
00:52:51,381 --> 00:52:53,007
- Oh fuck this!

1103
00:52:53,299 --> 00:52:53,925
Fuck this!

1104
00:52:54,217 --> 00:52:55,718
Every time I need to take a shower

1105
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:58,012
the two of you are in here talking, okay?

1106
00:52:58,304 --> 00:53:00,390
Use the fucking living room!

1107
00:53:00,682 --> 00:53:03,142
We have a couch for a reason!

1108
00:53:03,434 --> 00:53:04,185
We all split it!

1109
00:53:04,477 --> 00:53:05,019
We all pay for it!

1110
00:53:05,311 --> 00:53:05,853
Go sit on it!

1111
00:53:06,145 --> 00:53:07,563
- Fuck you!
- That was rude!

1112
00:53:07,855 --> 00:53:10,191
- I hope every member of
your family dies today!

1113
00:53:10,483 --> 00:53:12,026
- This is where I feel safe!
- Today!

1114
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:17,198
- I hope they pass away today!
- Everyone in your life today!

1115
00:53:21,911 --> 00:53:23,621
- (chuckles) Good man, good man.

1116
00:53:23,913 --> 00:53:25,123
- Pat!

1117
00:53:25,415 --> 00:53:26,999
This turnout is amazing!

1118
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:28,543
- It's the most we've ever had.

1119
00:53:28,835 --> 00:53:30,420
- Yeah, this place is huge.

1120
00:53:30,712 --> 00:53:33,923
- Yeah, it used to be a rec
center for at-risk youth.

1121
00:53:34,215 --> 00:53:36,175
Back before they cleaned
up the neighborhood.

1122
00:53:36,467 --> 00:53:37,927
And now it's just a place for people

1123
00:53:38,219 --> 00:53:40,430
who need something
positive in their lives.

1124
00:53:40,722 --> 00:53:42,807
Plus they do burlesque on Tuesdays.

1125
00:53:43,099 --> 00:53:43,641
- Hey.

1126
00:53:43,933 --> 00:53:44,475
- Hey.

1127
00:53:44,767 --> 00:53:45,351
- Hey.

1128
00:53:45,643 --> 00:53:46,185
- Hey Ben.

1129
00:53:46,477 --> 00:53:47,019
- How's it going, man?

1130
00:53:47,311 --> 00:53:47,854
- So glad you could make it.

1131
00:53:48,146 --> 00:53:49,605
- Look, I can't stay too long.

1132
00:53:49,897 --> 00:53:51,524
I think I'm a little old
for this kind of thing,

1133
00:53:51,816 --> 00:53:54,444
but I just wanted to come
for some moral support.

1134
00:53:54,736 --> 00:53:55,570
- I really appreciate that.

1135
00:53:55,862 --> 00:53:56,654
- All right, gotcha.

1136
00:53:56,946 --> 00:53:57,613
- Hey, good to see you.

1137
00:53:57,905 --> 00:53:59,282
- Good to see you.

1138
00:54:00,241 --> 00:54:02,160
- Pat, you like really know
how to connect with people.

1139
00:54:02,452 --> 00:54:05,455
- I just try to make people's
lives a little bit better.

1140
00:54:05,747 --> 00:54:06,497
- Yeah.

1141
00:54:07,707 --> 00:54:08,458
- Hey.

1142
00:54:09,751 --> 00:54:10,877
- Oh shit.

1143
00:54:11,169 --> 00:54:12,128
My phone is about to die.

1144
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:14,088
- Oh, I have a charger in my bag.

1145
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:14,922
Feel free.

1146
00:54:15,214 --> 00:54:15,757
Help yourself.

1147
00:54:16,048 --> 00:54:16,716
- Oh, thank you so much.

1148
00:54:17,008 --> 00:54:17,675
- Hey.

1149
00:54:17,967 --> 00:54:21,471
(chuckles) Get in here.

1150
00:54:21,763 --> 00:54:22,597
No, side pocket!

1151
00:54:22,889 --> 00:54:25,516
(dramatic sting)

1152
00:54:26,476 --> 00:54:27,560
I can explain.

1153
00:54:29,645 --> 00:54:31,022
Madison no!

1154
00:54:31,314 --> 00:54:33,441
(suspense music)

1155
00:54:33,733 --> 00:54:34,525
Madison!

1156
00:54:36,444 --> 00:54:37,820
- What's wrong?

1157
00:54:38,112 --> 00:54:38,988
- Nothing.

1158
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,532
Just a misunderstanding with Madison.

1159
00:54:41,824 --> 00:54:44,911
- Why are you so obsessed with her?

1160
00:54:45,203 --> 00:54:45,703
- What?

1161
00:54:45,995 --> 00:54:46,829
I'm not.

1162
00:54:47,121 --> 00:54:49,582
Like anybody else, she's just
somebody I'm trying to help.

1163
00:54:49,874 --> 00:54:51,959
- I see the way you look at her.

1164
00:54:52,251 --> 00:54:53,252
- What?

1165
00:54:53,544 --> 00:54:55,338
I don't have a way that I look at her.

1166
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:56,756
- Why not me?

1167
00:54:57,048 --> 00:54:57,965
- What?

1168
00:54:58,257 --> 00:55:00,676
- Pat, I think about you all the time.

1169
00:55:00,968 --> 00:55:03,554
I'm the girl you should want, me!

1170
00:55:03,846 --> 00:55:05,097
- I had no idea.

1171
00:55:05,389 --> 00:55:06,766
I never realized.

1172
00:55:07,058 --> 00:55:08,434
- Well now you do.

1173
00:55:08,726 --> 00:55:11,646
So why not do something about it?

1174
00:55:11,938 --> 00:55:13,606
- In case you haven't
noticed, I'm pretty tied up

1175
00:55:13,898 --> 00:55:14,941
with the Spoon-A-Thon right now.

1176
00:55:15,233 --> 00:55:17,610
- They'll be fine without you.

1177
00:55:18,569 --> 00:55:19,320
Come on.

1178
00:55:22,365 --> 00:55:23,115
- Uh...

1179
00:55:25,493 --> 00:55:26,244
- Hi everyone.

1180
00:55:26,536 --> 00:55:27,578
Everyone, hi.

1181
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:28,412
Thank you.

1182
00:55:28,704 --> 00:55:29,247
Come on.

1183
00:55:29,539 --> 00:55:30,081
Come on up.

1184
00:55:30,373 --> 00:55:31,541
Hi, hello, hi.

1185
00:55:31,833 --> 00:55:32,959
Yes.

1186
00:55:33,251 --> 00:55:34,710
Thank you all so much for coming out

1187
00:55:35,002 --> 00:55:37,296
to this year's annual Spoon-A-Thon!

1188
00:55:37,588 --> 00:55:40,967
This event is a great way
to make physical contact

1189
00:55:41,259 --> 00:55:44,720
without the grossness
and scariness of sex!

1190
00:55:46,013 --> 00:55:47,306
Okay, let's partner up.

1191
00:55:47,598 --> 00:55:49,267
Everybody gets spooning!

1192
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:50,226
Yes!

1193
00:55:50,518 --> 00:55:51,561
(fingers snapping)

1194
00:55:51,853 --> 00:55:52,603
Welcome.

1195
00:55:52,895 --> 00:55:53,646
Hi guys.

1196
00:55:54,647 --> 00:55:55,648
- [Dylan] Hi.

1197
00:55:57,859 --> 00:56:00,486
(sensual music)

1198
00:56:04,198 --> 00:56:04,907
- Well?

1199
00:56:06,617 --> 00:56:10,288
- Cher, there's something
I need to show you.

1200
00:56:11,873 --> 00:56:12,623
- Pat?

1201
00:56:12,915 --> 00:56:14,166
- I carry this around with me to remind me

1202
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:16,669
of the day that I was attacked.

1203
00:56:16,961 --> 00:56:21,173
Any time I feel sad or weak
I pull it out and I say.

1204
00:56:22,633 --> 00:56:25,386
You hold no power over me.

1205
00:56:25,678 --> 00:56:26,846
I'm not afraid of you.

1206
00:56:27,138 --> 00:56:28,556
I control my fear.

1207
00:56:30,099 --> 00:56:31,100
I control it!

1208
00:56:33,728 --> 00:56:36,022
So that's how I'm so well-adjusted.

1209
00:56:36,314 --> 00:56:37,607
But now Madison saw it and now I think

1210
00:56:37,899 --> 00:56:39,650
that she thinks that I'm the killer.

1211
00:56:39,942 --> 00:56:41,527
- Pat, I understand.

1212
00:56:42,904 --> 00:56:46,198
Now I have something I need to show you.

1213
00:56:48,409 --> 00:56:49,619
My rad titties.

1214
00:56:53,456 --> 00:56:55,041
Don't look away, Pat.

1215
00:56:55,333 --> 00:56:58,044
Gaze upon my hot ass knockers.

1216
00:56:58,336 --> 00:57:01,714
Watch them sway up and down, side to side.

1217
00:57:04,133 --> 00:57:06,594
Yes, I know you want them.

1218
00:57:06,886 --> 00:57:07,970
And I want you.

1219
00:57:09,847 --> 00:57:10,806
- [Pat] Okay.

1220
00:57:11,098 --> 00:57:13,601

00:58:36,475 --> 00:58:40,479
Don't ever let any man
tell you that you aren't.

1244
00:58:40,771 --> 00:58:42,023
- Is that your penis?

1245
00:58:42,314 --> 00:58:43,107
- [Dylan] Yes.

1246
00:58:43,399 --> 00:58:45,026
You are so observant.

1247
00:58:46,777 --> 00:58:49,780
Sorry I didn't ask if it was
okay to pull my dick out.

1248
00:58:50,072 --> 00:58:51,407
I didn't want to make you do

1249
00:58:51,699 --> 00:58:53,868
the emotional labor of telling me no.

1250
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,662
But don't worry, I'm
not going to try to do

1251
00:58:56,996 --> 00:59:00,958
"just the tip" or anything
that men would try to do.

1252
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:04,003
Honestly, until we have a woman president,

1253
00:59:04,295 --> 00:59:07,715
I don't think men should be
allowed to penetrate vaginas.

1254
00:59:08,007 --> 00:59:11,093
(Cher moans and laughs)

1255
00:59:12,553 --> 00:59:13,137
- Oh Pat!

1256
00:59:13,429 --> 00:59:14,096
Yes Pat!

1257
00:59:14,388 --> 00:59:15,347
Oh god yes!

1258
00:59:15,639 --> 00:59:16,682
Give it to me!

1259
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:22,063
- Did you get it?

1260
00:59:22,354 --> 00:59:23,439
Did I do okay?

1261
00:59:28,694 --> 00:59:31,322
(dramatic music)

1262
00:59:36,243 --> 00:59:37,912
- You were wonderful.

1263
00:59:39,705 --> 00:59:41,707
Now it's your turn.

1264
00:59:41,999 --> 00:59:42,792
- Oh.

1265
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:48,089
Seeing you happy, that makes my heart cum.

1266
00:59:49,131 --> 00:59:50,674
That's good enough for me.

1267
00:59:50,966 --> 00:59:51,926
- No Pat.

1268
00:59:52,218 --> 00:59:53,552
You deserve this.

1269
00:59:56,931 --> 00:59:59,517
- It's just that since
I had my penis severed,

1270
00:59:59,809 --> 01:00:04,105
it might be jarring when I
take these boxer shorts off.

1271
01:00:04,396 --> 01:00:05,147
- Oh Pat.

1272
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:07,274
I love you.

1273
01:00:07,566 --> 01:00:10,694
I love all of you no matter what.

1274
01:00:10,986 --> 01:00:11,779
- Okay.

1275
01:00:15,533 --> 01:00:18,077
(ominous sting)

1276
01:00:21,163 --> 01:00:22,706
- You're beautiful.

1277
01:00:30,965 --> 01:00:33,175
How do I do this exactly?

1278
01:00:33,467 --> 01:00:34,844
- Am I a nice guy?

1279
01:00:37,596 --> 01:00:38,556
- [Cher] What?

1280
01:00:38,848 --> 01:00:40,683
- Like, am I a nice guy?

1281
01:00:41,684 --> 01:00:45,437
- Yeah Pat, you're the
nicest guy I've ever met.

1282
01:00:45,729 --> 01:00:46,814
- Tell me how nice I am.

1283
01:00:47,106 --> 01:00:47,857
- You're so nice.

1284
01:00:48,149 --> 01:00:48,732
- Yeah?

1285
01:00:49,024 --> 01:00:49,608
- Really nice.

1286
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:51,443
You're really nice, Pat.

1287
01:00:51,735 --> 01:00:53,279
- Keep talking like that.

1288
01:00:53,571 --> 01:00:54,905
- You're my nice guy.

1289
01:00:55,197 --> 01:00:56,031
Pat is.

1290
01:00:56,323 --> 01:00:57,408
- You love it when I'm nice to you huh?

1291
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:59,243
- I love it when you're nice to me.

1292
01:00:59,535 --> 01:01:01,162
- Yeah, you fucking needed that niceness.

1293
01:01:01,495 --> 01:01:03,414
- I need that niceness all over me.

1294
01:01:03,706 --> 01:01:05,166
- Oh yeah, you need that respect?

1295
01:01:05,457 --> 01:01:06,250
- [Cher] I need that respect.

1296
01:01:06,542 --> 01:01:08,502
- Have you ever been respected
by a guy like me before?

1297
01:01:08,794 --> 01:01:10,337
- [Cher] No, never.

1298
01:01:10,629 --> 01:01:11,797
You're my first.

1299
01:01:12,089 --> 01:01:13,674
You're my first nice guy.

1300
01:01:13,966 --> 01:01:14,884
- Yeah.

1301
01:01:15,176 --> 01:01:16,135
- [Cher] You're so nice.

1302
01:01:16,427 --> 01:01:17,094
- Tell me how nice I am!

1303
01:01:17,386 --> 01:01:17,887
- Really nice.

1304
01:01:18,179 --> 01:01:18,721
- Tell me how nice!

1305
01:01:19,013 --> 01:01:19,555
- You're super nice!

1306
01:01:19,889 --> 01:01:20,431
- Tell me again.

1307
01:01:20,723 --> 01:01:21,432
Tell me I'm nice!

1308
01:01:21,724 --> 01:01:24,435
(Pat moans loudly)

1309
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:44,663
Oh my god.

1310
01:01:44,955 --> 01:01:45,539
- Yeah.

1311
01:01:45,831 --> 01:01:46,498
- That was incredible.

1312
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:48,292
- You're good, yeah.

1313
01:01:49,919 --> 01:01:51,462
Let me go get you a towel.

1314
01:01:51,754 --> 01:01:53,005
- Okay.

1315
01:01:53,297 --> 01:01:56,508
I'm a little worried, we
didn't use protection though.

1316
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,177
Whatever you decide.

1317
01:01:58,469 --> 01:02:00,137
Keep it, abort it.

1318
01:02:00,429 --> 01:02:02,223
Your body, your choice.

1319
01:02:03,682 --> 01:02:05,893
(Pat screams)

1320
01:02:06,185 --> 01:02:07,978
(Cher screams)

1321
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:09,438
- My testicles!

1322
01:02:13,859 --> 01:02:15,527
(Pat screams)

1323
01:02:15,819 --> 01:02:16,737
- No Pat, no!

1324
01:02:20,324 --> 01:02:21,075
Pat!

1325
01:02:21,367 --> 01:02:22,117
No!

1326
01:02:23,953 --> 01:02:24,787
Not my Pat!

1327
01:02:27,081 --> 01:02:28,707
- [Dylan] I'm just going to place my penis

1328
01:02:28,999 --> 01:02:30,459
between your butt cheeks.

1329
01:02:30,751 --> 01:02:32,169
Just kind of hotdogging it.

1330
01:02:32,461 --> 01:02:33,504
(distant stabbing)

1331
01:02:33,796 --> 01:02:34,505
- What was that?

1332
01:02:34,797 --> 01:02:35,547
- [Dylan] Hey hey hey.

1333
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:36,507
Don't be rude.

1334
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:39,510
I'm trying to hear all
about your hopes and dreams.

1335
01:02:39,802 --> 01:02:41,637
You want to make vintage clothes

1336
01:02:41,929 --> 01:02:44,056
or write a book or something?

1337
01:02:44,348 --> 01:02:45,849
- I wanna write a book
about vintage clothes.

1338
01:02:46,141 --> 01:02:48,560
- [Dylan] That's so amazing and brilliant.

1339
01:02:48,852 --> 01:02:52,481
(moans) I fully support you.

1340
01:02:55,567 --> 01:02:58,237
(suspense music)

1341
01:03:01,115 --> 01:03:03,826
(killer screams)

1342
01:03:15,004 --> 01:03:17,506
(Cher screams)

1343
01:03:31,103 --> 01:03:33,105
- [Killer] What the fuck?

1344
01:03:34,481 --> 01:03:36,567
- [Dylan] You are a queen.

1345
01:03:37,609 --> 01:03:38,610
A true queen.

1346
01:03:43,866 --> 01:03:47,619
Could you do me a favor
and not mention to anyone

1347
01:03:47,911 --> 01:03:51,081
that I shot a load down your ass crack?

1348
01:03:55,836 --> 01:03:58,339
What if I promise to do better?

1349
01:04:02,468 --> 01:04:05,012
(ominous music)

1350
01:04:07,556 --> 01:04:08,474
- Thank you.

1351
01:04:13,937 --> 01:04:16,398
(Cher screams)

1352
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:35,459
(eerie music)

1353
01:04:45,677 --> 01:04:47,012
- Oh my God, Kim.

1354
01:04:49,390 --> 01:04:50,557
I think.

1355
01:04:50,849 --> 01:04:52,184
I think Pat might be a murderer.

1356
01:04:52,476 --> 01:04:53,894
I found a mask in his bag and it is

1357
01:04:54,186 --> 01:04:55,687
the exact same type that the killer wore

1358
01:04:55,979 --> 01:04:56,855
and I think that might be why people

1359
01:04:57,147 --> 01:04:58,399
have been disappearing from group.

1360
01:04:58,690 --> 01:05:01,276
And I am just really, really scared.

1361
01:05:01,568 --> 01:05:02,236
Should I go to the police?

1362
01:05:02,528 --> 01:05:03,028
I don't know.

1363
01:05:03,362 --> 01:05:03,987
Kim, what do you think?

1364
01:05:04,279 --> 01:05:04,988
Kim?

1365
01:05:06,031 --> 01:05:06,615
Kim!

1366
01:05:06,907 --> 01:05:08,117
Kim, no stop!

1367
01:05:08,409 --> 01:05:09,201
Kim please!

1368
01:05:10,786 --> 01:05:13,705
Pat, why are you doing this?

1369
01:05:13,997 --> 01:05:15,165
- Oh what the shit.

1370
01:05:15,457 --> 01:05:17,709
Guys, I gotta get ready to
work a night shift, okay?

1371
01:05:18,001 --> 01:05:19,670
While apparently none of you have jobs.

1372
01:05:19,962 --> 01:05:21,713
(suspense music)

1373
01:05:22,047 --> 01:05:25,217
(angry roommate choking)

1374
01:05:44,153 --> 01:05:47,573
(Madison breathing heavy)

1375
01:05:50,576 --> 01:05:53,203
(dramatic sting)

1376
01:05:53,495 --> 01:05:55,914
(Madison gasps)

1377
01:06:31,575 --> 01:06:34,495
(music intensifies)

1378
01:06:38,707 --> 01:06:41,126
(synth music)

1379
01:06:42,169 --> 01:06:45,005
(killer chuckling)

1380
01:07:05,901 --> 01:07:09,029
(cartoonish laughing)

1381
01:07:41,979 --> 01:07:44,565
(loud whacking)

1382
01:07:46,149 --> 01:07:49,528
(second killer groaning)

1383
01:08:07,254 --> 01:08:10,173
(music intensifies)

1384
01:08:29,568 --> 01:08:31,320
(violent stabbing)

1385
01:08:31,612 --> 01:08:35,657
(third killer gurgles and whimpers)

1386
01:08:39,286 --> 01:08:41,747
(eerie music)

1387
01:08:52,966 --> 01:08:55,427
(loud ringing)

1388
01:09:10,901 --> 01:09:11,735
- Everyone.

1389
01:09:12,986 --> 01:09:15,781
Let's give Madison a warm welcome.

1390
01:09:17,074 --> 01:09:19,326
- [Killer Group] Hi Madison!

1391
01:09:20,911 --> 01:09:23,497
(heart beating)

1392
01:09:25,666 --> 01:09:28,502
- We're so happy you could be here.

1393
01:09:32,297 --> 01:09:33,799
- What's happening?

1394
01:09:38,095 --> 01:09:38,887
Ben?

1395
01:09:40,347 --> 01:09:41,098
Why?

1396
01:09:45,644 --> 01:09:46,853
- My son Jared.

1397
01:09:48,188 --> 01:09:50,691
He was such a good kid.

1398
01:09:50,982 --> 01:09:53,985
He was paying his way
through community college.

1399
01:09:54,277 --> 01:09:55,404
Working nights.

1400
01:09:57,072 --> 01:09:58,448
Delivering pizza.

1401
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:03,036
And then one night he went on a delivery.

1402
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:07,165
And he never came back.

1403
01:10:10,001 --> 01:10:12,212
And he wasn't the only one.

1404
01:10:13,171 --> 01:10:14,172
- My brother.

1405
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:16,591
- My stepson.

1406
01:10:17,592 --> 01:10:18,510
- My fiance.

1407
01:10:19,469 --> 01:10:21,054
- My best friend.

1408
01:10:21,346 --> 01:10:24,224
- The father of two of my children.

1409
01:10:24,516 --> 01:10:26,810
- My bunkmate from boot camp!

1410
01:10:27,769 --> 01:10:31,982
- The news reports went on
and on about the tragedy.

1411
01:10:33,066 --> 01:10:37,529
That was the deaths of those
poor little rich girls.

1412
01:10:37,821 --> 01:10:40,949
But when it came to the
people that we cared about?

1413
01:10:41,241 --> 01:10:42,325
That we loved?

1414
01:10:44,035 --> 01:10:47,289
Well they turn their deaths into a joke.

1415
01:10:49,458 --> 01:10:53,170
I literally heard police
officers saying things like.

1416
01:10:53,462 --> 01:10:56,423
"Hey, how many delivery boys does it take

1417
01:10:56,715 --> 01:10:59,843
"to deliver a pizza to a murder house?

1418
01:11:00,135 --> 01:11:02,345
"How many, I don't know!

1419
01:11:02,637 --> 01:11:05,098
"Apparently it's more than 20!"

1420
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:10,228
Hurtful, hurtful things.

1421
01:11:12,606 --> 01:11:14,983
- I do think a lot of it is
in the delivery of the joke.

1422
01:11:15,275 --> 01:11:15,859
If it's-

1423
01:11:16,151 --> 01:11:16,902
- Shut up!

1424
01:11:19,154 --> 01:11:22,491
There's some things you don't joke about!

1425
01:11:25,202 --> 01:11:27,496
I joined that therapy group.

1426
01:11:28,455 --> 01:11:29,372
To kill Pat.

1427
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:33,376
So imagine my surprise.

1428
01:11:35,879 --> 01:11:37,631
When he led us to you.

1429
01:11:40,717 --> 01:11:44,221
So if we can't get back
at Papa Santangeli?

1430
01:11:46,056 --> 01:11:47,098
Murdering you.

1431
01:11:48,517 --> 01:11:50,727
Well that's the next best thing.

1432
01:11:51,019 --> 01:11:52,979
- Okay, but then why did you kill

1433
01:11:53,271 --> 01:11:54,147
all the other people from the group?

1434
01:11:54,439 --> 01:11:55,023
They were innocent.

1435
01:11:55,315 --> 01:11:55,982
They didn't do anything.

1436
01:11:56,274 --> 01:11:56,817
- Why?

1437
01:11:57,108 --> 01:11:58,735
Because I am tired of listening

1438
01:11:59,027 --> 01:12:01,530
to 20-something narcissists go on and on

1439
01:12:01,822 --> 01:12:04,032
about the trials and tribulations

1440
01:12:04,324 --> 01:12:07,285
of trying to make it in the big city!

1441
01:12:08,787 --> 01:12:12,582
You're not the protagonist
of this story, Madison.

1442
01:12:12,874 --> 01:12:13,583
We are.

1443
01:12:18,296 --> 01:12:19,756
And you know what?

1444
01:12:20,048 --> 01:12:23,260
For once, it's the stories
of the working class

1445
01:12:23,552 --> 01:12:25,387
that are gonna be told.

1446
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:29,808
- Our dad died a few years ago.

1447
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:33,395
He had to work three jobs
to help mom pay the bills.

1448
01:12:33,687 --> 01:12:37,274
It was just a temporary gig
while he learned to code.

1449
01:12:37,566 --> 01:12:39,150
- He was delivering pizzas to help us

1450
01:12:39,442 --> 01:12:42,070
save up for an above ground pool.

1451
01:12:42,362 --> 01:12:44,781
- We were gonna open up a vape shop.

1452
01:12:45,073 --> 01:12:47,117
- With him dead, and my other ex

1453
01:12:47,409 --> 01:12:49,953
getting sent to prison for check fraud,

1454
01:12:50,245 --> 01:12:54,749
nearly 60% of my kids are
being raised fatherless!

1455
01:12:55,876 --> 01:12:58,253
- We got matching tattoos
back in the Corps.

1456
01:12:58,545 --> 01:13:00,463
When we'd put our shoulders together,

1457
01:13:00,755 --> 01:13:02,757
it would read "semper fidelis".

1458
01:13:03,049 --> 01:13:06,928
Without him, I just got
a tattoo that reads per.

1459
01:13:08,430 --> 01:13:09,180
And delis.

1460
01:13:12,225 --> 01:13:15,228
Health insurance doesn't
cover laser tattoo surgery.

1461
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:18,690
(tattooed killer crying)

1462
01:13:21,818 --> 01:13:24,362
(somber music)

1463
01:13:24,654 --> 01:13:27,282
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.

1464
01:13:29,659 --> 01:13:30,577
It's so sad.

1465
01:13:34,831 --> 01:13:35,957
Thank you.

1466
01:13:36,249 --> 01:13:37,042
Thank you.

1467
01:13:44,758 --> 01:13:45,467
- Madison.

1468
01:13:46,384 --> 01:13:50,221
It's time for you to meet
your friends in Hell.

1469
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:56,811
Where's my claw?

1470
01:13:58,146 --> 01:13:58,897
Guys.

1471
01:14:00,023 --> 01:14:01,483
Come on, is no one paying
attention to my claw?

1472
01:14:01,775 --> 01:14:02,359
(dramatic sting)

1473
01:14:02,651 --> 01:14:03,652
Oh, thank you.

1474
01:14:06,571 --> 01:14:08,573
- Punch them in the dick.

1475
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:13,119
(killers screaming)

1476
01:14:26,466 --> 01:14:27,634
(chainsaw stalling)

1477
01:14:27,926 --> 01:14:28,551
- Start!

1478
01:14:28,843 --> 01:14:30,011
- [Male Killer] Holy shit.

1479
01:14:30,303 --> 01:14:31,262
- [Female Killer] My twat.

1480
01:14:31,554 --> 01:14:32,263
- Start!

1481
01:14:34,182 --> 01:14:34,849
No.

1482
01:14:35,141 --> 01:14:35,809
Come on.

1483
01:14:37,644 --> 01:14:40,397
(Madison screams)

1484
01:14:43,191 --> 01:14:44,109
- Per.

1485
01:14:44,401 --> 01:14:45,110
Delis.

1486
01:14:51,116 --> 01:14:53,785
(suspense music)

1487
01:15:09,342 --> 01:15:12,137
(Madison screams)

1488
01:15:31,531 --> 01:15:34,367
(Madison grunting)

1489
01:15:54,554 --> 01:15:57,390
(chainsaw revving)

1490
01:15:58,850 --> 01:16:01,603
(Madison screams)

1491
01:17:09,838 --> 01:17:12,215
(Ben groans)

1492
01:17:27,021 --> 01:17:29,149
- The people will rise up.

1493
01:17:31,609 --> 01:17:34,154
Our voices will be heard.

1494
01:17:34,445 --> 01:17:35,947
- I'm so sorry.

1495
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:40,326
But nobody wants to see
stories about poor people.

1496
01:17:41,870 --> 01:17:44,581
(dramatic sting)

1497
01:17:46,374 --> 01:17:48,126
