00:00:01,507 --> 00:00:06,570
Cannes film festival 1959

2
00:00:06,645 --> 00:00:12,140
winner,
international critics award

3
00:00:12,218 --> 00:00:13,810
and

4
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:19,789
film writers' award

5
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,433
you saw nothing in hiroshima.
Nothing.

6
00:03:18,504 --> 00:03:20,335
I saw everything.

7
00:03:20,406 --> 00:03:23,739
I saw the hospital
- I'm sure of it.

8
00:03:25,144 --> 00:03:27,874
The hospital in hiroshima exists.

9
00:03:29,648 --> 00:03:33,846
How could I not have seen it?

10
00:03:52,805 --> 00:03:56,571
You didn't see the hospital
in hiroshima.

11
00:03:57,543 --> 00:04:00,876
You saw nothing in hiroshima.

12
00:04:07,352 --> 00:04:10,116
Four times at the museum.

13
00:04:10,322 --> 00:04:12,256
What museum in hiroshima?

14
00:04:26,205 --> 00:04:30,164
Four times at the museum in hiroshima.

15
00:04:30,275 --> 00:04:32,402
I saw people walking around.

16
00:04:32,511 --> 00:04:37,505
People walk around, lost in thought,
among the photographs,

17
00:04:37,683 --> 00:04:41,813
the reconstructions,
for lack of anything else.

18
00:04:41,887 --> 00:04:45,220
The photographs, the photographs,

19
00:04:45,257 --> 00:04:49,125
the reconstructions,
for lack of anything else.

20
00:04:49,461 --> 00:04:53,761
The explanations,
for lack of anything else.

21
00:04:56,502 --> 00:04:59,665
Four times at the museum in hiroshima.

22
00:05:01,073 --> 00:05:03,337
I watched the people.

23
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:09,870
I myself, lost in thought,
looked at the scorched metal.

24
00:05:10,382 --> 00:05:11,940
The twisted metal.

25
00:05:12,017 --> 00:05:15,475
Metal made as vulnerable as flesh.

26
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,424
I saw the bouquet of bottle caps.

27
00:05:20,492 --> 00:05:22,585
Who would have thought?

28
00:05:22,728 --> 00:05:25,561
Human flesh, suspended,
as if still alive,

29
00:05:25,831 --> 00:05:27,822
its agony still fresh.

30
00:05:29,034 --> 00:05:32,299
Stones. Charred stones.
Shattered stones.

31
00:05:33,338 --> 00:05:35,067
Anonymous masses of hair

32
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,506
that the women of hiroshima,
upon waking in the morning,

33
00:05:39,578 --> 00:05:41,443
would find had fallen out.

34
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,496
I was hot in peace square.

35
00:05:59,231 --> 00:06:02,200
10,000 degrees in peace square.

36
00:06:02,467 --> 00:06:04,526
I know it.

37
00:06:05,537 --> 00:06:09,098
The temperature of the sun
in peace square.

38
00:06:09,241 --> 00:06:11,266
How could you not know it?

39
00:06:11,476 --> 00:06:13,444
The grass. It's quite simple.

40
00:06:13,645 --> 00:06:17,081
You saw nothing in hiroshima.
Nothing.

41
00:06:26,058 --> 00:06:30,290
The reconstructions were
as authentic as possible.

42
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,798
The films were
as authentic as possible.

43
00:06:36,835 --> 00:06:41,499
The illusion,
quite simply, is so perfect

44
00:06:41,607 --> 00:06:43,973
that tourists weep.

45
00:06:45,043 --> 00:06:47,011
One can always scoff,

46
00:06:48,146 --> 00:06:50,546
but what else can a tourist do

47
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:53,482
but weep?

48
00:07:30,922 --> 00:07:34,085
I've always wept over hiroshima's fate.

49
00:07:34,993 --> 00:07:36,358
Always.

50
00:07:36,461 --> 00:07:37,519
No.

51
00:07:37,663 --> 00:07:41,190
What was there for you to weep over?

52
00:07:59,518 --> 00:08:01,748
I saw the newsreels.

53
00:08:01,953 --> 00:08:05,684
On the second day,
history tells us- I'm not making it up-

54
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:08,055
from the second day on,

55
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,358
certain species of animals
crawled from the depths of the earth,

56
00:08:12,464 --> 00:08:14,694
and from the ashes.

57
00:08:16,968 --> 00:08:21,302
Dogs were captured on film for all time.
I saw them.

58
00:08:21,673 --> 00:08:24,665
I saw the newsreels.
I saw them.

59
00:08:24,876 --> 00:08:28,209
Of the first day, the second day,

60
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,907
the third day.

61
00:08:30,082 --> 00:08:32,277
You saw nothing.

62
00:08:32,384 --> 00:08:35,114
Of the fifteenth day too.

63
00:08:36,088 --> 00:08:39,148
Hiroshima was covered in flowers.

64
00:08:39,624 --> 00:08:43,788
There were cornflowers
and gladioli everywhere,

65
00:08:43,895 --> 00:08:48,264
morning glories and day lilies

66
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,598
born again from the ashes

67
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:55,697
with an extraordinary vitality
unheard of in flowers before then.

68
00:08:56,007 --> 00:08:58,202
I didn't make any of it up.

69
00:08:58,276 --> 00:09:01,268
You made it all up.

70
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,477
None of it.

71
00:09:03,582 --> 00:09:06,642
Just as the illusion exists in love,

72
00:09:06,985 --> 00:09:10,045
the illusion you can never forget,

73
00:09:10,122 --> 00:09:14,616
so I was under the illusion
I would never forget hiroshima.

74
00:09:14,926 --> 00:09:17,554
Just like with love.

75
00:09:25,036 --> 00:09:27,698
I saw the survivors too,

76
00:09:27,773 --> 00:09:31,231
and those who were in the wombs
of the women of hiroshima.

77
00:09:32,043 --> 00:09:34,341
I saw the patience,

78
00:09:34,546 --> 00:09:36,173
the innocence,

79
00:09:36,648 --> 00:09:39,617
the apparent meekness

80
00:09:39,684 --> 00:09:42,778
with which the temporary survivors
of hiroshima

81
00:09:42,854 --> 00:09:45,914
adapted to a fate so unjust

82
00:09:45,991 --> 00:09:49,290
that the imagination,
usually so fertile,

83
00:09:49,394 --> 00:09:52,886
is silent before it.

84
00:10:08,313 --> 00:10:10,611
Listen. I know.

85
00:10:10,715 --> 00:10:12,979
I know everything.
It went on.

86
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:15,178
Nothing. You know nothing.

87
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,883
Women risk giving birth
to deformed children, to monsters,

88
00:10:19,324 --> 00:10:21,053
but it goes on.

89
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:24,228
Men risk becoming sterile,

90
00:10:24,296 --> 00:10:26,264
but it goes on.

91
00:10:26,398 --> 00:10:30,767
Rain causes panic, the rain
of ash on the waters of the pacific.

92
00:10:30,802 --> 00:10:35,296
The pacific turns deadly,
and its fishermen die.

93
00:10:35,373 --> 00:10:37,432
Food becomes an object of fear.

94
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:40,603
An entire city's food is thrown away.

95
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:43,307
The food of entire cities is buried.

96
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:45,645
An entire city rises up in anger.

97
00:10:46,952 --> 00:10:49,716
Entire cities rise up in anger.

98
00:10:50,755 --> 00:10:54,213
But against whom
do they rise up in anger?

99
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:57,753
The anger of entire cities,
whether they like it or not,

100
00:10:57,863 --> 00:10:59,990
against the principle
of inequality advanced

101
00:11:00,098 --> 00:11:03,363
by one people against another.

102
00:11:03,668 --> 00:11:06,000
The principle of inequality advanced

103
00:11:06,071 --> 00:11:09,837
by certain races against other races.

104
00:11:10,108 --> 00:11:12,668
The principle of inequality advanced

105
00:11:12,777 --> 00:11:16,178
by certain classes against other classes.

106
00:11:17,582 --> 00:11:19,379
Listen to me.

107
00:11:19,584 --> 00:11:21,643
Like you, I know
what it is to forget.

108
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,053
No, you don't know
what it is to forget.

109
00:11:25,891 --> 00:11:29,918
Like you, I am endowed with memory.
I know what it is to forget.

110
00:11:30,028 --> 00:11:34,089
No, you are not endowed with memory.

111
00:11:34,232 --> 00:11:38,293
Like you, I too have struggled
with all my might

112
00:11:39,037 --> 00:11:40,800
not to forget.

113
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,202
Like you, I forgot.

114
00:11:47,913 --> 00:11:52,043
Like you, I longed
for a memory beyond consolation,

115
00:11:53,084 --> 00:11:55,848
a memory of shadows and stone.

116
00:11:56,021 --> 00:11:59,684
For my part I struggled
every day with all my might

117
00:12:00,025 --> 00:12:02,687
against the horror
of no longer understanding

118
00:12:02,861 --> 00:12:05,386
the reason to remember.

119
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:08,966
Like you, I forgot.

120
00:12:15,774 --> 00:12:20,143
Why deny the obvious necessity
of remembering?

121
00:12:25,383 --> 00:12:28,147
Listen to me.
I know something else.

122
00:12:28,253 --> 00:12:29,880
It will begin again.

123
00:12:29,955 --> 00:12:34,483
200,000 dead and 80,000 wounded
in nine seconds.

124
00:12:34,593 --> 00:12:38,393
Those are the official figures.
It will begin again.

125
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:43,533
It will be 10,000 degrees on the earth.
Ten thousand suns, people will say.

126
00:12:43,602 --> 00:12:46,036
The asphalt will burn.

127
00:12:46,137 --> 00:12:49,038
Chaos will prevail.

128
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,938
An entire city will be lifted
off the ground,

129
00:12:52,043 --> 00:12:54,204
then fall back to earth in ashes.

130
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:02,345
New vegetation rises
from the sands.

131
00:13:03,555 --> 00:13:06,718
Four students await together,
like brothers,

132
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,658
a legendary death.

133
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,469
The seven branches of the delta estuary

134
00:13:18,603 --> 00:13:20,503
of the river ota

135
00:13:20,605 --> 00:13:25,008
drain and fill at their usual hour,

136
00:13:25,443 --> 00:13:29,311
precisely at their usual hour,

137
00:13:29,414 --> 00:13:33,214
with fresh water rich with fish,
grey or blue,

138
00:13:33,318 --> 00:13:35,411
depending on the season
and time of day.

139
00:13:36,621 --> 00:13:40,113
People along the muddy banks
no longer watch

140
00:13:40,725 --> 00:13:43,125
the tide slowly rise

141
00:13:43,261 --> 00:13:48,255
in the seven branches
of the delta estuary of the river ota.

142
00:14:01,846 --> 00:14:05,714
I meet you.
I remember you.

143
00:14:06,451 --> 00:14:08,180
Who are you?

144
00:14:08,253 --> 00:14:11,552
You're destroying me.
You're good for me.

145
00:14:12,057 --> 00:14:15,857
How could I know this city
was tailor-made for love?

146
00:14:16,795 --> 00:14:21,164
How could I know
you fit my body like a glove?

147
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,567
I like you.

148
00:14:23,668 --> 00:14:25,568
How unlikely.

149
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,670
I like you.

150
00:14:28,073 --> 00:14:30,439
How slow all of a sudden.

151
00:14:31,076 --> 00:14:33,067
How sweet.

152
00:14:33,411 --> 00:14:35,572
You cannot know.

153
00:14:36,214 --> 00:14:39,911
You're destroying me.
You're good for me.

154
00:14:46,124 --> 00:14:49,252
You're destroying me.
You're good for me.

155
00:14:50,862 --> 00:14:52,523
I have time.

156
00:14:52,764 --> 00:14:56,200
Please, devour me.

157
00:14:56,868 --> 00:15:00,269
Deform me
to the point of ugliness.

158
00:15:01,106 --> 00:15:02,767
Why not you?

159
00:15:03,475 --> 00:15:08,435
Why not you in this city
and in this night

160
00:15:08,513 --> 00:15:11,573
so like other cities and other nights
you can hardly tell the difference?

161
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,374
I beg of you.

162
00:15:16,688 --> 00:15:19,248
You have such beautiful skin.

163
00:15:23,128 --> 00:15:24,595
You!

164
00:15:25,363 --> 00:15:28,332
Yes, me. Surprised?

165
00:15:44,315 --> 00:15:49,309
Are you completely japanese or not?

166
00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:51,882
Completely. I am japanese.

167
00:15:53,792 --> 00:15:56,590
Your eyes are green, aren't they?

168
00:15:57,328 --> 00:16:00,058
Yes, I think they're green.

169
00:16:00,331 --> 00:16:02,856
You're like a thousand women in one.

170
00:16:03,835 --> 00:16:06,463
That's because you don't know me.

171
00:16:06,538 --> 00:16:09,268
That might not be the only reason.

172
00:16:11,242 --> 00:16:15,076
I don't mind being
a thousand women in one for you.

173
00:16:17,682 --> 00:16:19,513
Listen.

174
00:16:19,751 --> 00:16:21,480
It's 4:00.

175
00:16:21,953 --> 00:16:23,648
Why?

176
00:16:23,855 --> 00:16:25,755
I don't know who it is.

177
00:16:25,957 --> 00:16:29,120
Every day he passes by at 4:00
and coughs.

178
00:16:43,508 --> 00:16:45,942
Were you here in hiroshima?

179
00:16:46,544 --> 00:16:48,978
Of course not.

180
00:16:49,948 --> 00:16:52,849
That's right.
How foolish of me.

181
00:16:55,253 --> 00:16:58,711
But my family was in hiroshima.

182
00:17:00,491 --> 00:17:03,221
I was off fighting the war.

183
00:17:03,828 --> 00:17:06,296
Lucky for you, eh?

184
00:17:07,999 --> 00:17:09,557
Yes.

185
00:17:10,201 --> 00:17:12,431
Lucky for me too.

186
00:17:20,011 --> 00:17:22,571
Why are you in hiroshima?

187
00:17:22,814 --> 00:17:24,076
A film.

188
00:17:24,148 --> 00:17:25,809
A film?

189
00:17:25,917 --> 00:17:28,317
I'm acting in a film.

190
00:17:30,922 --> 00:17:34,016
Where were you
before you came to hiroshima?

191
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,560
Paris.

192
00:17:37,862 --> 00:17:40,160
And before Paris?

193
00:17:40,365 --> 00:17:43,266
Before Paris I was in nevers.

194
00:17:48,806 --> 00:17:51,172
It's in the province of nièvre.
You don't know it.

195
00:17:57,849 --> 00:18:01,114
Why did you want to see
everything in hiroshima?

196
00:18:02,921 --> 00:18:05,048
It interested me.

197
00:18:05,456 --> 00:18:07,481
I have my own idea about it.

198
00:18:08,126 --> 00:18:11,425
For example, looking closely
at things is something

199
00:18:12,697 --> 00:18:14,062
that has to be learned.

200
00:18:14,165 --> 00:18:14,563
That has to be learned.

201
00:19:26,771 --> 00:19:28,500
Would you like some coffee?

202
00:19:41,386 --> 00:19:43,217
What were you dreaming about?

203
00:19:43,388 --> 00:19:45,356
I don't remember. Why?

204
00:19:46,657 --> 00:19:48,420
I was watching your hands.

205
00:19:48,626 --> 00:19:50,651
They move when you're sleep.

206
00:19:55,199 --> 00:19:59,363
Maybe that happens
when you don't realize you're dreaming.

207
00:20:21,225 --> 00:20:23,853
You're a beautiful woman.
You know that?

208
00:20:23,961 --> 00:20:25,792
- You think so?
- I think so.

209
00:20:26,064 --> 00:20:28,396
A bit worn out, no?

210
00:20:30,268 --> 00:20:32,896
- A bit ugly.
- You don't mind?

211
00:20:33,004 --> 00:20:35,472
That's what I noticed
last night at the café.

212
00:20:35,573 --> 00:20:38,098
How ugly you were and...

213
00:20:38,176 --> 00:20:40,940
- and?
- And how bored you looked.

214
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:42,569
Tell me more.

215
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,910
You were bored in a way
that makes a man want to know a woman.

216
00:20:52,623 --> 00:20:54,614
You speak french well.

217
00:20:55,159 --> 00:20:56,421
Don't I though!

218
00:20:56,594 --> 00:20:59,995
I'm glad you finally noticed.

219
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:05,735
I hadn't noticed
that you don't speak japanese.

220
00:21:07,772 --> 00:21:13,733
Have you ever noticed people have
a way of noticing what they want?

221
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,108
I noticed you. That's all.

222
00:21:33,531 --> 00:21:38,594
To meet in hiroshima.

223
00:21:40,438 --> 00:21:42,429
That doesn't happen everyday.

224
00:21:42,773 --> 00:21:46,800
What did hiroshima
mean to you in france?

225
00:21:49,914 --> 00:21:51,882
The end of the war.

226
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,710
I mean completely.

227
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,088
Astonishment that they dared do it,

228
00:21:58,189 --> 00:22:00,521
and astonishment
that they succeeded.

229
00:22:02,026 --> 00:22:05,086
And the beginning
of an unknown fear for us as well.

230
00:22:06,831 --> 00:22:09,197
And then indifference.

231
00:22:09,734 --> 00:22:12,168
And fear of indifference as well.

232
00:22:12,436 --> 00:22:14,233
Where were you?

233
00:22:15,573 --> 00:22:17,837
I had just left nevers.

234
00:22:18,042 --> 00:22:19,873
I was in Paris. In the street.

235
00:22:21,145 --> 00:22:24,945
That's a beautiful french word: Nevers.

236
00:22:27,652 --> 00:22:30,416
A word like any other.
Just like the town.

237
00:22:39,697 --> 00:22:42,689
Have you met many japanese
in hiroshima?

238
00:22:43,834 --> 00:22:45,665
A few,

239
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:48,138
but none like you.

240
00:22:48,673 --> 00:22:51,540
Am I the first japanese in your life?

241
00:22:51,642 --> 00:22:53,132
Yes.

242
00:22:53,945 --> 00:22:55,776
Hiroshima.

243
00:22:56,147 --> 00:22:59,412
The whole world rejoiced,

244
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:03,142
and you rejoiced with it.

245
00:23:04,956 --> 00:23:09,120
Was it a beautiful summer day in Paris?

246
00:23:10,027 --> 00:23:12,495
I heard it was. Wasn't it?

247
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,798
Yes, it was a nice day.

248
00:23:15,499 --> 00:23:18,798
- How old were you?
- Twenty. You?

249
00:23:19,303 --> 00:23:22,295
- Twenty-two.
- The same age, really.

250
00:23:23,007 --> 00:23:24,565
Just about.

251
00:23:31,015 --> 00:23:33,575
What do you do for work?

252
00:23:34,652 --> 00:23:36,745
I'm an architect.

253
00:23:38,623 --> 00:23:41,057
And I'm also...

254
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,023
in politics.

255
00:23:44,395 --> 00:23:46,693
Is that why you speak french so well?

256
00:23:46,897 --> 00:23:51,027
That's why.
To read about the french revolution.

257
00:23:56,507 --> 00:23:59,237
What is this film you're in?

258
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,407
It's a film about peace.

259
00:24:01,612 --> 00:24:04,843
What else would you expect
in hiroshima?

260
00:24:21,866 --> 00:24:24,198
I'd like to see you again.

261
00:24:27,805 --> 00:24:30,296
At this time tomorrow

262
00:24:31,409 --> 00:24:33,400
I'll be on my way back to france.

263
00:24:33,577 --> 00:24:36,068
Really? You didn't tell me.

264
00:24:37,982 --> 00:24:39,745
It's true.

265
00:24:39,917 --> 00:24:42,181
There was no point in telling you.

266
00:24:42,887 --> 00:24:46,345
That's why you let me
come up to your room last night.

267
00:24:46,457 --> 00:24:49,790
Because it was your last day
in hiroshima.

268
00:24:51,495 --> 00:24:54,726
Not at all.
The thought never crossed my mind.

269
00:24:54,865 --> 00:24:59,461
When you speak, I wonder
whether you lie or tell the truth.

270
00:25:00,371 --> 00:25:03,397
I lie... and I tell the truth.

271
00:25:04,075 --> 00:25:06,908
But I have no reason to lie to you.

272
00:25:07,511 --> 00:25:12,073
Tell me, do things like this
happen to you often?

273
00:25:13,284 --> 00:25:15,115
Not all that often.

274
00:25:15,286 --> 00:25:17,447
But they happen.

275
00:25:18,889 --> 00:25:21,380
I'm very fond of men.

276
00:25:24,028 --> 00:25:26,690
I have dubious morals, you know.

277
00:25:27,331 --> 00:25:30,823
What do you call
having "dubious morals"?

278
00:25:31,469 --> 00:25:34,063
Being dubious
about other people's morals.

279
00:25:41,879 --> 00:25:44,313
I'd like to see you again.

280
00:25:44,582 --> 00:25:48,712
Even if your plane leaves tomorrow morning.
Even if you have dubious morals.

281
00:25:51,789 --> 00:25:53,313
Why?

282
00:25:54,392 --> 00:25:55,882
Because.

283
00:26:10,341 --> 00:26:12,275
You don't want
to talk to me anymore?

284
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,546
I'd like to see you again.

285
00:26:28,058 --> 00:26:30,356
Where are you going in france?
Nevers?

286
00:26:30,494 --> 00:26:33,895
No, Paris.
I'm never going back to nevers.

287
00:26:34,298 --> 00:26:36,289
- Never?
- Never.

288
00:26:38,202 --> 00:26:41,137
I was never younger
than I was in nevers.

289
00:26:41,906 --> 00:26:43,840
Young in nevers.

290
00:26:45,242 --> 00:26:47,335
Young in nevers.

291
00:26:47,478 --> 00:26:51,938
And mad in nevers too.

292
00:27:07,431 --> 00:27:11,527
You see, nevers
is the one city in the world -

293
00:27:12,136 --> 00:27:15,594
the one thing in the world -
I dream of most at night

294
00:27:16,707 --> 00:27:21,041
and at the same time
think about the least.

295
00:27:22,246 --> 00:27:24,714
What was this madness
of yours in nevers like?

296
00:27:27,518 --> 00:27:30,043
Madness is like intelligence.

297
00:27:30,621 --> 00:27:34,318
You can't explain it.
Just like intelligence.

298
00:27:34,425 --> 00:27:37,952
It comes over you, consumes you,

299
00:27:38,662 --> 00:27:40,357
and then you understand.

300
00:27:40,464 --> 00:27:43,365
But when it's gone,
you no longer understand it at all.

301
00:27:43,567 --> 00:27:45,467
Were you full of hate?

302
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,367
That was my madness.

303
00:27:47,505 --> 00:27:49,803
I was mad with hate.

304
00:27:50,407 --> 00:27:54,741
I felt I could make a career of hating.

305
00:27:54,912 --> 00:27:57,642
All I cared about was hating.

306
00:27:57,915 --> 00:28:00,008
Do you understand?
- Yes.

307
00:28:02,353 --> 00:28:05,720
It's true. I guess you must
understand that too.

308
00:28:06,023 --> 00:28:08,583
Did it ever happen to you again?

309
00:28:11,262 --> 00:28:12,820
It's over.

310
00:28:12,963 --> 00:28:14,658
During the war?

311
00:28:14,765 --> 00:28:16,323
Right after it.

312
00:28:17,568 --> 00:28:21,698
Was that one of the hardships
of life in france after the war?

313
00:28:22,172 --> 00:28:24,800
You could say that.

314
00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:28,103
When did this madness of yours pass?

315
00:28:28,512 --> 00:28:31,845
It went away little by little,
and then when I had children, of course.

316
00:28:31,916 --> 00:28:33,543
What did you say?

317
00:28:33,684 --> 00:28:37,677
I said it went away little by little,
and then when I had children, of course.

318
00:28:42,226 --> 00:28:46,788
I'd like to spend a few days with you
somewhere sometime.

319
00:28:48,866 --> 00:28:50,197
Me too.

320
00:28:50,267 --> 00:28:52,929
To see you again today
wouldn't really be "seeing you again."

321
00:28:53,003 --> 00:28:56,564
Such a short time doesn't count.
I really would like to.

322
00:29:05,983 --> 00:29:07,473
Very well.

323
00:29:10,988 --> 00:29:13,513
It's because
you know I'm leaving tomorrow.

324
00:29:13,691 --> 00:29:16,251
That may be part of it.

325
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,851
But it's as good a reason
as any, isn't it?

326
00:29:20,264 --> 00:29:25,702
The thought of never seeing you again
in just a few hours -

327
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:16,076
you were easy to find in hiroshima.

328
00:30:23,961 --> 00:30:26,555
Is it a french film?

329
00:30:27,064 --> 00:30:30,625
No. International.
It's about peace.

330
00:30:30,901 --> 00:30:33,893
- Is it finished?
- It is for me.

331
00:30:34,304 --> 00:30:36,204
There are some crowd scenes
left to shoot.

332
00:30:38,976 --> 00:30:42,070
There are lots of commercials
for soap.

333
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:44,613
Maybe by pressing the point -

334
00:30:44,715 --> 00:30:46,444
yes, maybe.

335
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:50,518
Here in hiroshima we don't
make fun of films about peace.

336
00:31:05,202 --> 00:31:07,033
Are you tired?

337
00:31:12,776 --> 00:31:14,607
No more than you.

338
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,942
I've been thinking
about nevers in france.

339
00:31:20,417 --> 00:31:22,408
I've been thinking about you.

340
00:31:24,488 --> 00:31:26,581
Is your flight still tomorrow?

341
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,988
- Yes.
- Without fail?

342
00:31:29,093 --> 00:31:32,119
Yes. The picture is behind schedule.

343
00:31:32,429 --> 00:31:34,897
I was supposed to be in Paris
a month ago.

344
00:31:59,623 --> 00:32:04,492
You give me
a tremendous desire to love.

345
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,998
Always.

346
00:32:09,533 --> 00:32:11,831
Short-lived affairs.

347
00:32:14,071 --> 00:32:15,902
Me too.

348
00:32:23,947 --> 00:32:27,178
It's not always this strong,
and you know it.

349
00:32:36,393 --> 00:32:40,523
They say there's a storm coming
before nightfall.

350
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:54,338
If one a-bomb equals
20,000 ordinary bombs,

351
00:33:01,985 --> 00:33:05,182
and an h-bomb equals
1,500 atomic bombs,

352
00:33:13,197 --> 00:33:16,098
how much do the 40,000
a-bombs and h-bombs

353
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,531
currently stockpiled
in the world equal?

354
00:33:19,603 --> 00:33:24,404
They are a tribute
to man's scientific genius.

355
00:33:25,108 --> 00:33:27,576
But unfortunately
man's political intelligence

356
00:33:27,644 --> 00:33:30,704
is 100 times less developed
than his scientific intelligence,

357
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:36,519
and for that reason
he forfeits our respect.

358
00:33:36,553 --> 00:33:39,044
Stop thermonuclear testing!

359
00:34:10,921 --> 00:34:13,856
I don't like to think
about you leaving tomorrow.

360
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,228
I think I love you.

361
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:32,734
You will come with me once more.

362
00:35:45,515 --> 00:35:47,506
Answer me.

363
00:35:48,885 --> 00:35:50,785
Are you afraid?

364
00:37:04,194 --> 00:37:05,923
Sit down.

365
00:37:09,499 --> 00:37:11,831
Are you all alone in hiroshima?

366
00:37:12,302 --> 00:37:14,327
Where is your wife?

367
00:37:14,805 --> 00:37:18,741
She's in unzen, in the mountains.
I'm alone.

368
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:21,903
When is she coming back?

369
00:37:22,112 --> 00:37:23,943
In a few days.

370
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:37,923
What is your wife like?

371
00:37:39,062 --> 00:37:40,859
Beautiful.

372
00:37:41,164 --> 00:37:44,497
I'm a man
who's happy with his wife.

373
00:37:46,436 --> 00:37:48,131
So am I.

374
00:37:48,705 --> 00:37:51,230
I'm a woman
who's happy with her husband.

375
00:37:52,609 --> 00:37:54,600
It would have been too easy.

376
00:37:57,114 --> 00:38:00,106
- Don't you work in the afternoon?
- Yes, a lot.

377
00:38:00,317 --> 00:38:02,808
Mostly in the afternoon.

378
00:38:08,859 --> 00:38:11,020
This whole thing is ridiculous.

379
00:38:42,292 --> 00:38:44,726
Are you giving up your afternoon
because of me?

380
00:38:46,363 --> 00:38:48,627
Tell me.
What difference can it make?

381
00:38:57,007 --> 00:39:01,467
The man you loved during the war-
was he french?

382
00:39:09,786 --> 00:39:11,811
He wasn't french.

383
00:39:21,631 --> 00:39:23,258
Yes.

384
00:39:24,334 --> 00:39:26,598
It was in nevers.

385
00:40:23,059 --> 00:40:26,119
At first we met in barns.

386
00:40:28,598 --> 00:40:31,089
Then among the ruins.

387
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:36,261
Then in rooms.

388
00:40:36,373 --> 00:40:38,273
Like anywhere else.

389
00:40:57,994 --> 00:40:59,859
Then he died.

390
00:41:07,671 --> 00:41:09,866
I was 18.

391
00:41:10,073 --> 00:41:12,337
He was 23.

392
00:41:53,483 --> 00:41:57,476
Why speak of him and not others?

393
00:41:57,587 --> 00:41:59,521
- Why not?
- No! Why?

394
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:03,424
Because of nevers.

395
00:42:04,327 --> 00:42:07,387
I'm only just beginning
to know you,

396
00:42:08,031 --> 00:42:12,661
and from the many thousands
of things in your life,

397
00:42:12,736 --> 00:42:14,727
I choose nevers.

398
00:42:14,871 --> 00:42:16,896
Just like that?

399
00:42:17,374 --> 00:42:20,002
- Yes.
- No, it wasn't by chance.

400
00:42:20,076 --> 00:42:22,442
You have to tell me why.

401
00:42:23,847 --> 00:42:28,250
I somehow understand
that it was there

402
00:42:28,752 --> 00:42:32,654
that you were so young

403
00:42:33,356 --> 00:42:36,450
that you didn't yet belong
to anyone in particular,

404
00:42:36,593 --> 00:42:38,686
and I like that.

405
00:42:39,028 --> 00:42:41,053
No, that's not it.

406
00:42:44,734 --> 00:42:48,135
I somehow understand
that it was there

407
00:42:48,271 --> 00:42:51,365
that I almost lost you

408
00:42:51,441 --> 00:42:56,105
and ran the risk
of never, ever meeting you.

409
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:00,381
I somehow understand
that it was there

410
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:06,283
that you began to be
who you are today.

411
00:43:35,251 --> 00:43:37,742
I want to leave this place!

412
00:43:42,826 --> 00:43:45,761
There's nothing left for us to do now

413
00:43:45,895 --> 00:43:49,956
but kill the hours until your departure.

414
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,469
Sixteen hours until your flight.

415
00:43:55,738 --> 00:43:57,763
It's too much!

416
00:43:59,108 --> 00:44:01,167
You mustn't be afraid.

417
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:49,549
Does "nevers" have
any other meaning in french?

418
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,689
No.

419
00:44:53,263 --> 00:44:57,996
Would you have been cold
in that cellar in nevers

420
00:44:58,067 --> 00:45:00,331
if we had loved each other?

421
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:03,070
I would have been cold.

422
00:45:03,873 --> 00:45:07,673
The cellars in nevers are cold
both summer and winter.

423
00:45:09,279 --> 00:45:12,874
The city slopes down to a river
called the loire.

424
00:45:13,883 --> 00:45:16,477
I can't picture nevers.

425
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:20,077
Nevers. Population 40,000.

426
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:22,924
Built like a capital.

427
00:45:23,259 --> 00:45:25,887
A child can walk
all the way around it.

428
00:45:26,129 --> 00:45:28,097
I was born in nevers.

429
00:45:34,237 --> 00:45:36,432
I grew up in nevers.

430
00:45:39,342 --> 00:45:41,902
I learned to read in nevers.

431
00:45:46,182 --> 00:45:50,175
That's where I turned 20.

432
00:45:56,225 --> 00:45:58,216
And the loire?

433
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:03,599
It's a completely unnavigable river.

434
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:05,824
It's always empty

435
00:46:06,536 --> 00:46:10,438
due to its irregular course
and sand bars.

436
00:46:13,643 --> 00:46:16,703
In france it's considered
a very beautiful river,

437
00:46:18,548 --> 00:46:21,949
due mostly to its light.

438
00:46:24,287 --> 00:46:26,983
So very soft.

439
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:29,890
If you only knew.

440
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,299
When you're in the cellar, am I dead?

441
00:46:40,803 --> 00:46:42,430
You're dead.

442
00:46:47,744 --> 00:46:49,712
How can anyone endure such pain?

443
00:46:54,083 --> 00:46:56,051
The cellar is small.

444
00:46:57,053 --> 00:46:59,214
Very small.

445
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:03,754
The marseillaise passes
above my head.

446
00:47:05,094 --> 00:47:06,618
It's deafening!

447
00:47:13,703 --> 00:47:16,672
Hands become useless in a cellar.

448
00:47:18,608 --> 00:47:22,271
They claw
and scrape away at the rocks

449
00:47:23,413 --> 00:47:25,438
until they bleed.

450
00:47:28,151 --> 00:47:31,951
It's all you can think of
to help yourself

451
00:47:32,422 --> 00:47:35,152
and to remember.

452
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:40,818
I loved blood since I had tasted yours.

453
00:47:58,014 --> 00:48:01,040
The world passes by above my head,

454
00:48:01,651 --> 00:48:04,984
in place of the sky, of course.

455
00:48:06,222 --> 00:48:09,020
I watch that world pass by.

456
00:48:09,525 --> 00:48:12,619
Hurriedly during the week,

457
00:48:13,162 --> 00:48:16,063
leisurely on sundays.

458
00:48:17,967 --> 00:48:20,800
It doesn't know I'm in the cellar.

459
00:48:21,471 --> 00:48:24,031
They pretend I'm dead.

460
00:48:24,107 --> 00:48:26,837
Dead, far from nevers.

461
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:34,980
My father prefers it that way,
since I was disgraced.

462
00:48:35,518 --> 00:48:37,918
My father prefers...

463
00:48:39,789 --> 00:48:41,484
do you scream?

464
00:48:42,091 --> 00:48:44,559
Not in the beginning.

465
00:48:44,694 --> 00:48:46,594
I call your name softly.

466
00:48:46,662 --> 00:48:49,460
- But I'm dead.
- I call your name anyway.

467
00:48:49,565 --> 00:48:51,396
Even if you're dead.

468
00:48:51,467 --> 00:48:54,459
Then one day, I suddenly scream.

469
00:48:54,504 --> 00:48:57,530
Loud, like a deaf person.

470
00:48:58,574 --> 00:49:00,667
That's when they put me in the cellar.

471
00:49:00,777 --> 00:49:02,711
To punish me.

472
00:49:02,979 --> 00:49:07,439
- What did you scream?
- Your german name. Just your name.

473
00:49:08,618 --> 00:49:13,078
The only memory I have left
is your name.

474
00:49:16,626 --> 00:49:19,356
I promise I won't scream anymore,

475
00:49:19,562 --> 00:49:22,554
so they take me back up to my room.

476
00:49:25,368 --> 00:49:29,566
I yearn for you so badly
I can't bear it anymore.

477
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,870
- Are you afraid?
- I'm afraid everywhere.

478
00:49:32,942 --> 00:49:34,933
In the cellar. In my room.

479
00:49:38,681 --> 00:49:42,640
- Of what?
- Of never seeing you again.

480
00:49:43,953 --> 00:49:45,853
Ever.

481
00:49:49,859 --> 00:49:53,522
I turn 20 one day in the cellar.

482
00:49:54,897 --> 00:49:57,695
My mother comes
and tells me I'm 20 years old.

483
00:49:59,502 --> 00:50:01,629
My mother's crying.

484
00:50:01,704 --> 00:50:04,264
Do you spit in your mother's face?

485
00:50:05,908 --> 00:50:06,704
Yes.

486
00:50:13,216 --> 00:50:15,081
Drink.

487
00:50:22,825 --> 00:50:25,089
Afterwards, I don't remember anymore.

488
00:50:27,396 --> 00:50:29,557
I don't remember anymore.

489
00:50:31,267 --> 00:50:37,968
You were saying the cellars
in nevers are old and damp?

490
00:50:39,175 --> 00:50:42,770
Yes, full of saltpeter.

491
00:50:46,449 --> 00:50:49,350
Sometimes a cat comes in
to have a look around.

492
00:50:49,752 --> 00:50:51,777
It doesn't bother me.

493
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:56,155
I don't remember anymore.

494
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:58,618
Afterwards, I don't remember anymore.

495
00:50:59,161 --> 00:51:01,254
How long?

496
00:51:02,598 --> 00:51:04,623
An eternity.

497
00:51:57,787 --> 00:52:00,722
I was so young once!

498
00:52:12,535 --> 00:52:15,629
At night my mother
takes me into the garden.

499
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:19,970
She looks at my head.

500
00:52:20,576 --> 00:52:24,273
Every night she looks
carefully at my head.

501
00:52:26,182 --> 00:52:29,447
She still doesn't dare come close.

502
00:52:31,053 --> 00:52:34,147
At night I can see the town square.

503
00:52:34,757 --> 00:52:37,225
So I look.

504
00:52:38,327 --> 00:52:40,522
It's huge.

505
00:52:42,531 --> 00:52:44,999
It curves in the middle.

506
00:52:46,769 --> 00:52:49,738
Sleep comes only at dawn.

507
00:52:51,774 --> 00:52:54,607
Does it ever rain?

508
00:52:56,645 --> 00:52:59,045
Along the walls.

509
00:53:04,387 --> 00:53:06,651
I think of you,

510
00:53:07,656 --> 00:53:09,988
but I no longer speak of it.

511
00:53:10,359 --> 00:53:12,259
Madwoman!

512
00:53:15,297 --> 00:53:18,630
Madly in love with you.

513
00:53:23,139 --> 00:53:25,699
My hair grows back.

514
00:53:26,509 --> 00:53:29,967
I can feel it with my hands, day by day.

515
00:53:30,146 --> 00:53:32,410
I don't care.

516
00:53:32,915 --> 00:53:35,907
But still, it's growing back.

517
00:53:39,221 --> 00:53:41,985
Do you scream
before going down to the cellar?

518
00:53:42,925 --> 00:53:45,519
No. I feel nothing.

519
00:53:45,728 --> 00:53:47,195
They're young.

520
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:50,760
They shave my head carefully
till they finish the job.

521
00:53:51,033 --> 00:53:53,900
They believe it's their duty.

522
00:53:54,103 --> 00:53:56,765
Are you ashamed for them, my love?

523
00:53:59,208 --> 00:54:00,869
You are dead.

524
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:04,336
I'm too busy suffering.

525
00:54:05,548 --> 00:54:08,312
Night falls.

526
00:54:09,718 --> 00:54:13,654
I hear nothing but the sound
of the scissors on my head.

527
00:54:15,057 --> 00:54:21,223
It eases the pain
of your death a bit, like -

528
00:54:22,164 --> 00:54:26,123
I don't know how else to say it -

529
00:54:26,368 --> 00:54:31,203
like for my nails... the walls... my anger.

530
00:54:34,276 --> 00:54:36,676
What pain!

531
00:54:36,812 --> 00:54:39,110
What pain in my heart!

532
00:54:42,585 --> 00:54:45,315
They sing the marseillaise
all through the town.

533
00:54:46,822 --> 00:54:48,790
Night falls.

534
00:54:48,958 --> 00:54:51,552
My dead lover is an enemy of france.

535
00:54:53,362 --> 00:54:56,525
Someone says she should be
paraded through town.

536
00:54:57,566 --> 00:55:01,593
My father's pharmacy is closed
due to the disgrace.

537
00:55:03,105 --> 00:55:05,573
I am alone.

538
00:55:06,208 --> 00:55:08,608
Some of them are laughing.

539
00:55:10,412 --> 00:55:13,040
I return home at night.

540
00:55:30,833 --> 00:55:35,668
And then one day, my love,
your eternity comes to an end.

541
00:55:43,979 --> 00:55:45,503
Yes.

542
00:55:47,583 --> 00:55:52,111
A long time.
They said it was a long time.

543
00:55:54,790 --> 00:56:00,490
The cathedral bells ring at 6:00
every evening, summer and winter.

544
00:56:01,263 --> 00:56:04,630
One day I hear them.

545
00:56:05,034 --> 00:56:08,470
I remember having heard them before.

546
00:56:08,637 --> 00:56:11,663
Before, when we were in love,

547
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:14,300
when we were happy.

548
00:56:15,844 --> 00:56:17,835
I begin to see.

549
00:56:18,347 --> 00:56:21,680
I remember having seen before,

550
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:24,480
when we were in love,

551
00:56:24,653 --> 00:56:27,121
when we were happy.

552
00:56:28,457 --> 00:56:30,448
I remember.

553
00:56:30,726 --> 00:56:32,751
I see the ink.

554
00:56:32,895 --> 00:56:35,159
I see the daylight.

555
00:56:35,798 --> 00:56:39,234
I see my life. Your death.

556
00:56:39,501 --> 00:56:43,096
My life that goes on,
your death that goes on.

557
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:49,072
I see that the shadows take longer
to reach the corners of the room

558
00:56:50,779 --> 00:56:56,376
and the corners of the cellar.

559
00:56:57,753 --> 00:57:00,085
About half past six.

560
00:57:04,126 --> 00:57:06,594
Winter has ended.

561
00:57:15,904 --> 00:57:17,804
It's horrible!

562
00:57:18,007 --> 00:57:20,771
I remember you
less and less clearly.

563
00:57:22,911 --> 00:57:25,141
Give me something to drink.

564
00:57:33,956 --> 00:57:36,584
I begin to forget you.

565
00:57:38,394 --> 00:57:41,522
I tremble at forgetting such love.

566
00:57:43,299 --> 00:57:45,130
More.

567
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:06,278
We were to meet at noon
on the banks of the loire.

568
00:58:07,723 --> 00:58:10,556
I was to leave with him.

569
00:58:11,894 --> 00:58:14,727
When I arrived at noon
on the banks of the loire,

570
00:58:16,198 --> 00:58:18,166
he wasn't quite dead yet.

571
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:21,401
Someone had fired on him
from a garden.

572
00:58:23,172 --> 00:58:28,576
I stayed by his body all that day

573
00:58:30,279 --> 00:58:33,407
and all the following night.

574
00:58:36,885 --> 00:58:42,016
The next morning, they came
to get him and put him in a truck.

575
00:58:43,792 --> 00:58:47,159
Nevers was liberated that night.

576
00:58:50,566 --> 00:58:56,198
The cathedral bells rang and rang.

577
00:58:59,274 --> 00:59:02,801
He grew cold beneath me,
little by little.

578
00:59:06,281 --> 00:59:09,307
He took so long to die!

579
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:13,179
When?

580
00:59:13,489 --> 00:59:15,923
I don't know exactly.

581
00:59:16,625 --> 00:59:19,617
I was lying on top of him.

582
00:59:23,532 --> 00:59:26,933
The moment of his death
actually escaped me,

583
00:59:29,938 --> 00:59:34,739
because at that moment
and even afterwards -

584
00:59:36,345 --> 00:59:38,870
yes, I can even say afterwards -

585
00:59:39,448 --> 00:59:42,940
I couldn't find
the slightest difference

586
00:59:43,051 --> 00:59:45,485
between his dead body and my own.

587
00:59:48,991 --> 00:59:52,222
His body and mine

588
00:59:53,495 --> 00:59:56,396
seemed to me to be
one and the same.

589
00:59:57,299 --> 01:00:01,235
You understand?
He was my first love!

590
01:00:19,655 --> 01:00:22,488
Then one day I screamed again,

591
01:00:22,925 --> 01:00:25,485
so they put me back in the cellar.

592
01:00:39,274 --> 01:00:41,572
It was warm.

593
01:00:46,048 --> 01:00:49,848
I think it was then
that my hatred left me.

594
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:54,284
I don't scream anymore.

595
01:00:54,623 --> 01:00:57,319
I become reasonable.

596
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:02,096
They say, "she's become reasonable."

597
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:07,926
One holiday evening

598
01:01:08,904 --> 01:01:10,963
they let me out.

599
01:01:11,773 --> 01:01:15,004
The banks of the loire at dawn.

600
01:01:16,078 --> 01:01:18,171
People cross the bridge,

601
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:20,848
in greater or smaller numbers,
depending on the hour.

602
01:01:20,916 --> 01:01:22,781
From afar they're nobody.

603
01:01:23,886 --> 01:01:26,081
It isn't long after that

604
01:01:26,188 --> 01:01:30,648
that my mother tells me I must
leave for Paris during the night.

605
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:33,585
She gives me some money.

606
01:01:35,464 --> 01:01:39,093
I take off for Paris
one night on a bicycle.

607
01:01:40,536 --> 01:01:43,596
It's summer, and the nights are warm.

608
01:01:56,218 --> 01:01:58,379
When I get to Paris two days later,

609
01:01:58,587 --> 01:02:01,988
hiroshima is in all the papers.

610
01:02:03,692 --> 01:02:06,684
My hair has grown back
to a decent length.

611
01:02:06,929 --> 01:02:09,762
I'm among the crowds in the street.

612
01:02:14,536 --> 01:02:17,505
Fourteen years have passed.

613
01:02:49,237 --> 01:02:52,229
I don't even remember
his hands very well.

614
01:02:53,742 --> 01:02:56,404
I still remember the pain a little bit.

615
01:02:56,645 --> 01:02:58,476
Tonight?

616
01:02:58,947 --> 01:03:01,507
Yes, I remember it tonight.

617
01:03:03,051 --> 01:03:05,849
But one day
I will no longer remember it.

618
01:03:06,154 --> 01:03:08,145
At all.

619
01:03:09,057 --> 01:03:11,218
Nothing.

620
01:03:14,029 --> 01:03:17,897
Tomorrow at this time

621
01:03:18,634 --> 01:03:22,195
I'll be thousands of miles from you.

622
01:03:24,406 --> 01:03:27,933
Does your husband know this story?

623
01:03:32,914 --> 01:03:35,212
So I'm the only one?

624
01:03:36,418 --> 01:03:38,283
Yes.

625
01:03:45,494 --> 01:03:48,895
I'm the only one who knows!

626
01:03:48,997 --> 01:03:50,897
Be quiet.

627
01:04:25,567 --> 01:04:28,263
It's so nice sometimes
to be with someone!

628
01:04:30,972 --> 01:04:32,599
Yes.

629
01:04:39,314 --> 01:04:41,441
Tell me more.

630
01:04:42,617 --> 01:04:43,948
Tell me.

631
01:04:51,493 --> 01:04:54,929
In a few years,
when I have forgotten you,

632
01:04:55,797 --> 01:04:59,494
and other adventures like this one

633
01:04:59,568 --> 01:05:04,699
will happen to me
from sheer force of habit,

634
01:05:06,174 --> 01:05:11,669
I'll remember you
as the symbol of love's forgetfulness.

635
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:15,980
I'll think of this story
as of the horror of forgetting.

636
01:05:16,118 --> 01:05:18,245
I already know it.

637
01:05:23,091 --> 01:05:27,152
Don't things ever stop
at night in hiroshima?

638
01:05:28,130 --> 01:05:30,928
No, they never stop.

639
01:05:32,634 --> 01:05:34,499
I like that.

640
01:05:35,370 --> 01:05:38,965
Cities where there's always
someone awake,

641
01:05:39,541 --> 01:05:42,567
day or night.

642
01:07:09,831 --> 01:07:14,700
Sometimes we have to avoid thinking
about the problems life presents.

643
01:07:15,804 --> 01:07:19,467
Otherwise we'd suffocate.

644
01:07:26,815 --> 01:07:29,249
Get away from me.

645
01:07:29,851 --> 01:07:32,752
The sun hasn't risen yet.

646
01:07:37,759 --> 01:07:41,695
We'll probably die
without ever seeing each other again.

647
01:07:43,565 --> 01:07:45,965
Yes, probably.

648
01:07:47,402 --> 01:07:50,371
Unless, perhaps, one day...

649
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:53,503
a war...

650
01:07:55,744 --> 01:07:57,541
yes.

651
01:07:58,413 --> 01:08:00,244
A war.

652
01:10:50,251 --> 01:10:52,583
You think you know,

653
01:10:53,555 --> 01:10:55,750
but no.

654
01:10:56,157 --> 01:10:58,022
Never.

655
01:11:05,967 --> 01:11:10,028
In her youth in nevers
she had a german love.

656
01:11:12,474 --> 01:11:15,671
We'll go to bavaria, my love,

657
01:11:16,111 --> 01:11:18,636
and we'll get married.

658
01:11:20,482 --> 01:11:23,474
She never went to bavaria.

659
01:11:26,187 --> 01:11:29,987
Let those who never went to bavaria
dare speak to her of love!

660
01:11:31,693 --> 01:11:34,355
You were not quite dead yet.

661
01:11:35,029 --> 01:11:37,520
I told our story.

662
01:11:38,233 --> 01:11:41,498
I cheated on you tonight
with that stranger.

663
01:11:41,736 --> 01:11:44,432
I told our story.

664
01:11:44,606 --> 01:11:47,166
You see, it was there to tell.

665
01:11:47,375 --> 01:11:52,836
Fourteen years since I've tasted
an impossible love!

666
01:11:54,015 --> 01:11:55,983
Since nevers.

667
01:11:56,184 --> 01:11:58,175
Look how I'm forgetting you.

668
01:11:58,486 --> 01:12:00,420
Look how I've forgotten you.

669
01:12:00,722 --> 01:12:02,690
Look at me.

670
01:12:50,838 --> 01:12:53,068
I'm going to stay in hiroshima.

671
01:12:53,942 --> 01:12:57,105
With him. Every night.

672
01:12:57,645 --> 01:13:00,079
In hiroshima.

673
01:13:00,148 --> 01:13:03,640
I'm going to stay here. Here.

674
01:13:14,395 --> 01:13:17,364
Stay in hiroshima.

675
01:13:18,833 --> 01:13:23,293
Of course I'll stay in hiroshima

676
01:13:24,906 --> 01:13:26,874
with you.

677
01:13:30,245 --> 01:13:32,941
I'm so miserable!

678
01:13:34,048 --> 01:13:37,609
I wasn't expecting this at all.
You understand?

679
01:13:49,097 --> 01:13:50,894
Go away!

680
01:13:53,501 --> 01:13:55,901
I couldn't possibly leave you.

681
01:14:20,762 --> 01:14:24,254
Stay in hiroshima with me.

682
01:14:31,773 --> 01:14:34,503
He's going to walk towards me.

683
01:14:35,176 --> 01:14:37,940
He's going to take me by the shoulders.

684
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:41,307
He's going to kiss me.

685
01:14:42,283 --> 01:14:45,912
He's going to kiss me and I'll be lost.

686
01:15:49,484 --> 01:15:51,611
I meet you.

687
01:15:52,019 --> 01:15:54,510
I remember you.

688
01:15:55,390 --> 01:15:58,484
This city was tailor-made for love.

689
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:02,793
You fit my body like a glove.

690
01:16:03,631 --> 01:16:07,431
Who are you? You're destroying me.

691
01:16:08,136 --> 01:16:09,763
I was hungry.

692
01:16:09,837 --> 01:16:11,771
Hungry for infidelity,

693
01:16:12,039 --> 01:16:16,032
for adultery, for lies,

694
01:16:16,144 --> 01:16:17,941
and for death.

695
01:16:18,045 --> 01:16:19,808
I always have been.

696
01:16:22,784 --> 01:16:26,117
I had no doubt
you'd cross my path one day.

697
01:16:26,854 --> 01:16:32,156
I waited for you calmly,
with boundless impatience.

698
01:16:35,029 --> 01:16:37,054
Devour me.

699
01:16:37,532 --> 01:16:39,796
Deform me to your likeness,

700
01:16:39,901 --> 01:16:43,337
so that no one after you
will ever again understand

701
01:16:43,438 --> 01:16:46,100
the reason for so much desire.

702
01:16:48,042 --> 01:16:51,068
We'll be alone, my love.

703
01:16:51,479 --> 01:16:53,447
Night will never end.

704
01:16:54,081 --> 01:16:57,244
The day will never dawn again
on anyone.

705
01:16:57,552 --> 01:17:00,544
Never again.

706
01:17:00,855 --> 01:17:02,652
At last.

707
01:17:11,599 --> 01:17:13,931
You're still destroying me.

708
01:17:14,735 --> 01:17:16,930
You're good for me.

709
01:17:18,306 --> 01:17:23,005
We'll mourn the departed day
in good conscience and with goodwill.

710
01:17:23,511 --> 01:17:26,776
There'll be nothing else for us to do

711
01:17:27,114 --> 01:17:29,742
but mourn the departed day.

712
01:17:30,418 --> 01:17:34,479
Time will pass. Only time.

713
01:17:36,157 --> 01:17:38,557
And a time will come

714
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:45,192
when we can no longer name
what it is that binds us.

715
01:17:47,134 --> 01:17:50,592
Its name will gradually
be erased from our memory

716
01:17:51,005 --> 01:17:54,839
until it vanishes completely.

717
01:18:26,974 --> 01:18:31,035
Perhaps there's a chance you'll stay.

718
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:34,143
You know very well.

719
01:18:34,215 --> 01:18:36,945
Staying is even more impossible
than leaving.

720
01:18:37,018 --> 01:18:38,781
A week.

721
01:18:41,289 --> 01:18:42,881
Three days.

722
01:18:42,990 --> 01:18:45,151
Time enough for what?

723
01:18:45,259 --> 01:18:47,727
To live from it? To die from it?

724
01:18:47,895 --> 01:18:50,159
Time enough to know which.

725
01:18:51,365 --> 01:18:53,595
There is no such thing.

726
01:18:54,001 --> 01:18:57,232
Neither time enough to live from it,
nor time enough to die from it.

727
01:19:00,107 --> 01:19:02,234
So I don't give a damn.

728
01:19:03,578 --> 01:19:08,277
I would prefer
you had died in nevers.

729
01:19:09,483 --> 01:19:11,508
So would I.

730
01:19:12,787 --> 01:19:15,722
But I didn't die in nevers.

731
01:20:07,842 --> 01:20:10,310
Nevers, you whom I'd forgotten,

732
01:20:10,511 --> 01:20:13,139
tonight I'd like to see you again.

733
01:20:14,548 --> 01:20:17,676
Night after night,
month after month, I set you afire

734
01:20:18,619 --> 01:20:21,713
while my body was ablaze
with his memory.

735
01:20:58,359 --> 01:21:02,489
While my body is still ablaze
with the memory of you,

736
01:21:03,464 --> 01:21:06,126
I'd like to see nevers once again.

737
01:21:06,567 --> 01:21:08,535
The loire.

738
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:12,535
Lovely poplar trees of nièvre,

739
01:21:13,274 --> 01:21:15,401
I give you up to oblivion.

740
01:21:17,078 --> 01:21:19,808
Dime-store romance,

741
01:21:20,281 --> 01:21:22,306
I consign you to oblivion.

742
01:21:23,718 --> 01:21:28,746
One night without you
and I waited for day to deliver me.

743
01:21:29,890 --> 01:21:35,590
One day without his eyes and she dies,
the young girl from nevers,

744
01:21:36,330 --> 01:21:38,992
shameless young girl from nevers.

745
01:21:39,433 --> 01:21:43,369
One day without his hands
and she knows the pain of love.

746
01:21:43,838 --> 01:21:45,829
Silly little girl

747
01:21:45,906 --> 01:21:48,170
who died of love in nevers.

748
01:21:48,275 --> 01:21:50,368
Little girl from nevers
with shaven head,

749
01:21:50,478 --> 01:21:53,106
this evening
I relinquish you to oblivion.

750
01:21:53,481 --> 01:21:56,177
Dime-store romance.

751
01:21:56,984 --> 01:22:02,479
As it was with him,
forgetting will begin with your eyes.

752
01:22:03,491 --> 01:22:08,952
Then, as with him,
it will swallow your voice.

753
01:22:10,364 --> 01:22:14,994
Then, as with him,
it will consume you entirely,

754
01:22:15,069 --> 01:22:17,128
little by little.

755
01:22:17,671 --> 01:22:21,266
You will become a song.

756
01:22:36,857 --> 01:22:39,348
Who is she?

757
01:22:39,994 --> 01:22:41,962
A french woman.

758
01:22:47,835 --> 01:22:49,928
What's the matter?

759
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:55,434
She's leaving japan in a little while.

760
01:22:57,077 --> 01:23:02,447
We're sad at having
to leave each other.

761
01:28:23,070 --> 01:28:25,971
I had to come.

762
01:28:57,771 --> 01:29:00,331
I'll forget you.
I'm forgetting you already!

763
01:29:00,407 --> 01:29:03,376
Look how I'm forgetting you!
Look at me!

764
01:29:26,533 --> 01:29:28,694
That's your name.

765
01:29:29,136 --> 01:29:31,764
Yes, that's my name.

766
01:29:34,074 --> 01:29:37,942
And your name is nevers.

767
01:29:38,478 --> 01:29:41,845
Nevers in france.

768
01:29:46,653 --> 01:29:49,645
The end

769
01:29:50,645 --> 01:30:00,645
