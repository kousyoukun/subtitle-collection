5
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:34,418
<i>You saw nothing in Hiroshima.</i>
<i>Nothing.</i>

6
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:36,320
<i>I saw everything.</i>

7
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,723
<i>I saw the hospital</i>... - <i>I'm sure of it.</i>

8
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:43,859
<i>The hospital in Hiroshima exists.</i>

9
00:03:45,633 --> 00:03:49,831
<i>How could I not have seen it?</i>

10
00:04:08,823 --> 00:04:12,589
<i>You didn't see the hospital</i>
<i>in Hiroshima.</i>

11
00:04:13,561 --> 00:04:16,894
<i>You saw nothing in Hiroshima.</i>

12
00:04:23,371 --> 00:04:26,135
<i>Four times at the museum.</i>

13
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,274
<i>What museum in Hiroshima?</i>

14
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:46,149
<i>Four times at the museum in Hiroshima.</i>

15
00:04:46,227 --> 00:04:48,388
<i>I saw people walking around.</i>

16
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:53,490
<i>People walk around, lost in thought,</i>
<i>among the photographs,</i>

17
00:04:53,634 --> 00:04:57,798
<i>the reconstructions,</i>
<i>for lack of anything else.</i>

18
00:04:57,872 --> 00:05:01,239
<i>The photographs, the photographs,</i>

19
00:05:01,309 --> 00:05:05,143
<i>the reconstructions,</i>
<i>for lack of anything else.</i>

20
00:05:05,446 --> 00:05:09,780
<i>The explanations,</i>
<i>for lack of anything else.</i>

21
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,683
<i>Four times at the museum in Hiroshima.</i>

22
00:05:17,058 --> 00:05:19,356
<i>I watched the people.</i>

23
00:05:19,927 --> 00:05:25,888
<i>I myself, lost in thought,</i>
<i>looked at the scorched metal.</i>

24
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,959
<i>The twisted metal.</i>

25
00:05:28,035 --> 00:05:31,471
<i>Metal made as vulnerable as flesh.</i>

26
00:05:33,975 --> 00:05:36,443
<i>I saw the bouquet of bottle caps.</i>

27
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,603
<i>Who would have thought?</i>

28
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:41,546
<i>Human flesh, suspended,</i>
<i>as if still alive,</i>

29
00:05:41,816 --> 00:05:43,841
<i>its agony still fresh.</i>

30
00:05:44,986 --> 00:05:48,285
<i>Stones. Charred stones.</i>
<i>Shattered stones.</i>

31
00:05:49,323 --> 00:05:51,052
<i>Anonymous masses of hair</i>

32
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:55,491
<i>that the women of Hiroshima,</i>
<i>upon waking in the morning,</i>

33
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,428
<i>would find had fallen out.</i>

34
00:06:11,078 --> 00:06:14,514
<i>I was hot in Peace Square.</i>

35
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:18,241
<i>10,000 degrees in Peace Square.</i>

36
00:06:18,486 --> 00:06:20,545
<i>I know it.</i>

37
00:06:21,522 --> 00:06:25,117
<i>The temperature of the sun</i>
<i>in Peace Square.</i>

38
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,284
<i>How could you not know it?</i>

39
00:06:27,495 --> 00:06:29,463
<i>The grass. It's quite simple.</i>

40
00:06:29,664 --> 00:06:33,100
<i>You saw nothing in Hiroshima.</i>
<i>Nothing.</i>

41
00:06:42,076 --> 00:06:46,308
<i>The reconstructions were</i>
<i>as authentic as possible.</i>

42
00:06:47,915 --> 00:06:51,749
<i>The films were</i>
<i>as authentic as possible.</i>

43
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:57,484
<i>The illusion,</i>
<i>quite simply, is so perfect</i>

44
00:06:57,558 --> 00:07:00,026
<i>that tourists weep.</i>

45
00:07:01,062 --> 00:07:03,053
<i>One can always scoff,</i>

46
00:07:04,165 --> 00:07:06,599
<i>but what else can a tourist do</i>

47
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:09,534
<i>but weep?</i>

48
00:07:46,907 --> 00:07:50,104
<i>I've always wept over Hiroshima's fate.</i>

49
00:07:50,978 --> 00:07:52,377
<i>Always.</i>

50
00:07:52,446 --> 00:07:53,538
<i>No.</i>

51
00:07:53,614 --> 00:07:57,209
<i>What was there for you to weep over?</i>

52
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:17,799
<i>I saw the newsreels.</i>

53
00:08:18,005 --> 00:08:21,736
<i>On the second day,</i>
<i>history tells us</i>... - <i>I'm not making it up</i>... -

54
00:08:22,243 --> 00:08:24,108
<i>from the second day on,</i>

55
00:08:24,178 --> 00:08:28,410
<i>certain species of animals</i>
<i>crawled from the depths of the earth,</i>

56
00:08:28,482 --> 00:08:30,712
<i>and from the ashes.</i>

57
00:08:32,987 --> 00:08:37,321
<i>Dogs were captured on film for all time.</i>
<i>I saw them.</i>

58
00:08:37,691 --> 00:08:40,683
<i>I saw the newsreels.</i>
<i>I saw them.</i>

59
00:08:40,861 --> 00:08:44,228
<i>Of the first day, the second day,</i>

60
00:08:44,298 --> 00:08:45,925
<i>the third day.</i>

61
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,295
<i>You saw nothing.</i>

62
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:51,133
<i>Of the fifteenth day too.</i>

63
00:08:52,106 --> 00:08:55,166
<i>Hiroshima was covered in flowers.</i>

64
00:08:55,643 --> 00:08:59,875
<i>There were cornflowers</i>
<i>and gladioli everywhere,</i>

65
00:08:59,947 --> 00:09:04,281
<i>morning glories and day lilies</i>

66
00:09:04,351 --> 00:09:06,649
<i>born again from the ashes</i>

67
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,748
<i>with an extraordinary vitality</i>
<i>unheard of in flowers before then.</i>

68
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:14,254
<i>I didn't make any of it up.</i>

69
00:09:14,328 --> 00:09:17,297
<i>You made it all up.</i>

70
00:09:18,199 --> 00:09:19,530
<i>None of it.</i>

71
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,694
<i>Just as the illusion exists in love,</i>

72
00:09:23,003 --> 00:09:26,097
<i>the illusion you can never forget,</i>

73
00:09:26,173 --> 00:09:30,667
<i>so I was under the illusion</i>
<i>I would never forget Hiroshima.</i>

74
00:09:30,911 --> 00:09:33,607
<i>Just like with love.</i>

75
00:09:41,021 --> 00:09:43,717
<i>I saw the survivors too,</i>

76
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:47,227
<i>and those who were in the wombs</i>
<i>of the women of Hiroshima.</i>

77
00:09:48,028 --> 00:09:50,360
<i>I saw the patience,</i>

78
00:09:50,564 --> 00:09:52,191
<i>the innocence,</i>

79
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,625
<i>the apparent meekness</i>

80
00:09:55,703 --> 00:09:58,797
<i>with which the temporary survivors</i>
<i>of Hiroshima</i>

81
00:09:58,873 --> 00:10:01,933
<i>adapted to a fate so unjust</i>

82
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:05,308
<i>that the imagination,</i>
<i>usually so fertile,</i>

83
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:08,906
<i>is silent before it.</i>

84
00:10:24,298 --> 00:10:26,596
<i>Listen. I know.</i>

85
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,965
<i>I know everything.</i>
<i>It went on.</i>

86
00:10:29,036 --> 00:10:31,163
<i>Nothing. You know nothing.</i>

87
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:34,869
<i>Women risk giving birth</i>
<i>to deformed children, to monsters,</i>

88
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:37,038
<i>but it goes on.</i>

89
00:10:37,211 --> 00:10:40,180
<i>Men risk becoming sterile,</i>

90
00:10:40,247 --> 00:10:42,215
<i>but it goes on.</i>

91
00:10:42,349 --> 00:10:46,683
<i>Rain causes panic, the rain</i>
<i>of ash on the waters of the Pacific.</i>

92
00:10:46,754 --> 00:10:51,248
<i>The Pacific turns deadly,</i>
<i>and its fishermen die.</i>

93
00:10:51,325 --> 00:10:53,384
<i>Food becomes an object of fear.</i>

94
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,554
<i>An entire city's food is thrown away.</i>

95
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,258
<i>The food of entire cities is buried.</i>

96
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,665
<i>An entire city rises up in anger.</i>

97
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,734
<i>Entire cities rise up in anger.</i>

98
00:11:06,774 --> 00:11:10,210
<i>But against whom</i>
<i>do they rise up in anger?</i>

99
00:11:10,678 --> 00:11:13,772
<i>The anger of entire cities,</i>
<i>whether they like it or not,</i>

100
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:16,008
<i>against the principle</i>
<i>of inequality advanced</i>

101
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:19,348
<i>by one people against another.</i>

102
00:11:19,653 --> 00:11:21,985
<i>The principle of inequality advanced</i>

103
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:25,822
<i>by certain races against other races.</i>

104
00:11:26,093 --> 00:11:28,653
<i>The principle of inequality advanced</i>

105
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:32,130
<i>by certain classes against other classes.</i>

106
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:33,534
<i>Listen to me.</i>

107
00:11:33,534 --> 00:11:35,365
<i>Listen to me.</i>

108
00:11:35,536 --> 00:11:37,629
<i>Like you, I know</i>
<i>what it is to forget.</i>

109
00:11:37,705 --> 00:11:41,038
<i>No, you don't know</i>
<i>what it is to forget.</i>

110
00:11:41,842 --> 00:11:45,903
<i>Like you, I am endowed with memory.</i>
<i>I know what it is to forget.</i>

111
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:50,076
<i>No, you are not endowed with memory.</i>

112
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:54,246
<i>Like you, I too have struggled</i>
<i>with all my might</i>

113
00:11:54,989 --> 00:11:56,752
<i>not to forget.</i>

114
00:11:57,458 --> 00:12:00,222
<i>Like you, I forgot.</i>

115
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:08,061
<i>Like you, I longed</i>
<i>for a memory beyond consolation,</i>

116
00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:11,867
<i>a memory of shadows and stone.</i>

117
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:15,702
<i>For my part I struggled</i>
<i>every day with all my might</i>

118
00:12:16,043 --> 00:12:18,705
<i>against the horror</i>
<i>of no longer understanding</i>

119
00:12:18,846 --> 00:12:21,406
<i>the reason to remember.</i>

120
00:12:21,482 --> 00:12:24,940
<i>Like you, I forgot.</i>

121
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:36,128
<i>Why deny the obvious necessity</i>
<i>of remembering?</i>

122
00:12:41,368 --> 00:12:44,132
<i>Listen to me.</i>
<i>I know something else.</i>

123
00:12:44,204 --> 00:12:45,865
<i>It will begin again.</i>

124
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:50,467
<i>200,000 dead and 80,000 wounded</i>
<i>in nine seconds.</i>

125
00:12:50,544 --> 00:12:54,344
<i>Those are the official figures.</i>
<i>It will begin again.</i>

126
00:12:54,581 --> 00:12:59,484
<i>It will be 10,000 degrees on the earth.</i>
<i>Ten thousand suns, people will say.</i>

127
00:12:59,553 --> 00:13:02,044
<i>The asphalt will burn.</i>

128
00:13:02,122 --> 00:13:05,057
<i>Chaos will prevail.</i>

129
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,958
<i>An entire city will be lifted</i>
<i>off the ground,</i>

130
00:13:08,028 --> 00:13:10,223
<i>then fall back to earth in ashes.</i>

131
00:13:14,768 --> 00:13:18,363
<i>New vegetation rises</i>
<i>from the sands.</i>

132
00:13:19,573 --> 00:13:22,736
<i>Four students await together,</i>
<i>like brothers,</i>

133
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:25,677
<i>a legendary death.</i>

134
00:13:31,485 --> 00:13:34,477
<i>The seven branches of the delta estuary</i>

135
00:13:34,555 --> 00:13:36,489
<i>of the river Ota</i>

136
00:13:36,557 --> 00:13:40,960
<i>drain and fill at their usual hour,</i>

137
00:13:41,428 --> 00:13:45,296
<i>precisely at their usual hour,</i>

138
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:49,200
<i>with fresh water rich with fish,</i>
<i>grey or blue,</i>

139
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:51,396
<i>depending on the season</i>
<i>and time of day.</i>

140
00:13:52,573 --> 00:13:56,100
<i>People along the muddy banks</i>
<i>no longer watch</i>

141
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,110
<i>the tide slowly rise</i>

142
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:04,310
<i>in the seven branches</i>
<i>of the delta estuary of the river Ota.</i>

143
00:14:17,865 --> 00:14:21,699
<i>I meet you.</i>
<i>I remember you.</i>

144
00:14:22,469 --> 00:14:24,198
<i>Who are you?</i>

145
00:14:24,271 --> 00:14:27,570
<i>You're destroying me.</i>
<i>You're good for me.</i>

146
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:31,875
<i>How could I know this city</i>
<i>was tailor-made for love?</i>

147
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:37,149
<i>How could I know</i>
<i>you fit my body like a glove?</i>

148
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,552
<i>I like you.</i>

149
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,520
<i>How unlikely.</i>

150
00:14:41,722 --> 00:14:43,656
<i>I like you.</i>

151
00:14:44,057 --> 00:14:46,423
<i>How slow all of a sudden.</i>

152
00:14:47,027 --> 00:14:49,052
<i>How sweet.</i>

153
00:14:49,396 --> 00:14:51,557
<i>You cannot know.</i>

154
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:55,896
<i>You're destroying me.</i>
<i>You're good for me.</i>

155
00:15:02,142 --> 00:15:05,305
<i>You're destroying me.</i>
<i>You're good for me.</i>

156
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,575
<i>I have time.</i>

157
00:15:08,749 --> 00:15:12,241
<i>Please, devour me.</i>

158
00:15:12,886 --> 00:15:16,287
<i>Deform me</i>
<i>to the point of ugliness.</i>

159
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,785
<i>Why not you?</i>

160
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:24,454
<i>Why not you in this city</i>
<i>and in this night</i>

161
00:15:24,531 --> 00:15:27,591
<i>so like other cities and other nights</i>
<i>you can hardly tell the difference?</i>

162
00:15:28,402 --> 00:15:30,393
<i>I beg of you.</i>

163
00:15:32,706 --> 00:15:35,266
You have such beautiful skin.

164
00:15:39,112 --> 00:15:40,579
You!

165
00:15:41,348 --> 00:15:44,340
Yes, me. Surprised?

166
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:05,361
Are you completely Japanese or not?

167
00:16:05,739 --> 00:16:07,934
Completely. I am Japanese.

168
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:12,641
Your eyes are green, aren't they?

169
00:16:13,313 --> 00:16:16,111
Yes, I think they're green.

170
00:16:16,316 --> 00:16:18,910
You're like a thousand women in one.

171
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,482
That's because you don't know me.

172
00:16:22,556 --> 00:16:25,286
That might not be the only reason.

173
00:16:27,261 --> 00:16:31,095
I don't mind being
a thousand women in one for you.

174
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,531
Listen.

175
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:37,498
It's 4:00.

176
00:16:37,938 --> 00:16:39,667
Why?

177
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,740
I don't know who it is.

178
00:16:41,942 --> 00:16:45,139
Every day he passes by at 4:00
and coughs.

179
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:01,984
Were you here in Hiroshima?

180
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,031
Of course not.

181
00:17:05,999 --> 00:17:08,866
That's right.
How foolish of me.

182
00:17:11,305 --> 00:17:14,763
But my family was in Hiroshima.

183
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:19,273
I was off fighting the war.

184
00:17:19,846 --> 00:17:22,337
Lucky for you, eh?

185
00:17:24,017 --> 00:17:25,609
Yes.

186
00:17:26,186 --> 00:17:28,450
Lucky for me too.

187
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:38,589
Why are you in Hiroshima?

188
00:17:38,832 --> 00:17:40,094
A film.

189
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:41,828
A film?

190
00:17:41,902 --> 00:17:44,302
I'm acting in a film.

191
00:17:46,907 --> 00:17:50,035
Where were you
before you came to Hiroshima?

192
00:17:51,645 --> 00:17:53,545
Paris.

193
00:17:53,847 --> 00:17:56,145
And before Paris?

194
00:17:56,316 --> 00:17:59,217
Before Paris I was in Nevers.

195
00:18:04,858 --> 00:18:07,224
It's in the province of Nièvre.
You don't know it.

196
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,165
Why did you want to see
everything in Hiroshima?

197
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,099
It interested me.

198
00:18:21,508 --> 00:18:23,533
I have my own idea about it.

199
00:18:24,177 --> 00:18:27,476
For example, looking closely
at things is something

200
00:18:28,715 --> 00:18:30,150
that has to be learned.

201
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:30,582
that has to be learned.

202
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:44,518
Would you like some coffee?

203
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,235
What were you dreaming about?

204
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,374
I don't remember. Why?

205
00:20:02,676 --> 00:20:04,439
I was watching your hands.

206
00:20:04,611 --> 00:20:06,670
They move when you're sleep.

207
00:20:11,184 --> 00:20:15,348
Maybe that happens
when you don't realize you're dreaming.

208
00:20:37,177 --> 00:20:39,839
You're a beautiful woman.
You know that?

209
00:20:39,913 --> 00:20:41,744
- You think so?
- I think so.

210
00:20:41,982 --> 00:20:44,348
A bit worn out, no?

211
00:20:46,219 --> 00:20:48,847
- A bit ugly.
- You don't mind?

212
00:20:48,955 --> 00:20:51,423
That's what I noticed
last night at the café.

213
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:54,051
How ugly you were and...

214
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,891
- And?
- And how bored you looked.

215
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,520
Tell me more.

216
00:20:58,698 --> 00:21:02,930
You were bored in a way
that makes a man want to know a woman.

217
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,610
You speak French well.

218
00:21:11,111 --> 00:21:12,442
Don't I though!

219
00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:15,980
I'm glad you finally noticed.

220
00:21:17,784 --> 00:21:21,743
I hadn't noticed
that you don't speak Japanese.

221
00:21:23,757 --> 00:21:29,718
Have you ever noticed people have
a way of noticing what they want?

222
00:21:31,965 --> 00:21:35,093
I noticed you. That's all.

223
00:21:49,482 --> 00:21:54,545
To meet in Hiroshima.

224
00:21:56,389 --> 00:21:58,357
That doesn't happen everyday.

225
00:21:58,725 --> 00:22:02,821
What did Hiroshima
mean to you in France?

226
00:22:05,932 --> 00:22:07,866
The end of the war.

227
00:22:08,568 --> 00:22:10,729
I mean completely.

228
00:22:11,638 --> 00:22:14,106
Astonishment that they dared do it,

229
00:22:14,174 --> 00:22:16,540
and astonishment
that they succeeded.

230
00:22:17,978 --> 00:22:21,106
And the beginning
of an unknown fear for us as well.

231
00:22:22,816 --> 00:22:25,182
And then indifference.

232
00:22:25,685 --> 00:22:28,153
And fear of indifference as well.

233
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,219
Where were you?

234
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,822
I had just left Nevers.

235
00:22:34,027 --> 00:22:35,858
I was in Paris. In the street.

236
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:40,930
That's a beautiful French word: Nevers.

237
00:22:43,603 --> 00:22:46,401
A word like any other.
just like the town.

238
00:22:55,649 --> 00:22:58,675
Have you met many Japanese
in Hiroshima?

239
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:01,684
A few,

240
00:23:02,188 --> 00:23:04,122
but none like you.

241
00:23:04,691 --> 00:23:07,558
Am I the first Japanese in your life?

242
00:23:07,627 --> 00:23:09,151
Yes.

243
00:23:09,963 --> 00:23:11,794
Hiroshima.

244
00:23:12,132 --> 00:23:15,431
The whole world rejoiced,

245
00:23:15,635 --> 00:23:19,162
and you rejoiced with it.

246
00:23:20,974 --> 00:23:25,138
Was it a beautiful summer day in Paris?

247
00:23:26,012 --> 00:23:28,480
I heard it was. Wasn't it?

248
00:23:28,815 --> 00:23:30,783
Yes, it was a nice day.

249
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:34,784
- How old were you?
- Twenty. You?

250
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:38,280
- Twenty-two.
- The same age, really.

251
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,551
just about.

252
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,561
What do you do for work?

253
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,730
I'm an architect.

254
00:23:54,574 --> 00:23:57,042
And I'm also...

255
00:23:58,211 --> 00:24:00,076
in politics.

256
00:24:00,413 --> 00:24:02,711
Is that why you speak French so well?

257
00:24:02,882 --> 00:24:07,046
That's why.
To read about the French Revolution.

258
00:24:12,525 --> 00:24:15,255
What is this film you're in?

259
00:24:15,628 --> 00:24:17,425
It's a film about peace.

260
00:24:17,597 --> 00:24:20,862
What else would you expect
in Hiroshima?

261
00:24:37,817 --> 00:24:40,183
I'd like to see you again.

262
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:46,281
At this time tomorrow

263
00:24:47,394 --> 00:24:49,385
I'll be on my way back to France.

264
00:24:49,562 --> 00:24:52,030
Really? You didn't tell me.

265
00:24:53,933 --> 00:24:55,730
It's true.

266
00:24:55,902 --> 00:24:58,166
There was no point in telling you.

267
00:24:58,838 --> 00:25:02,399
That's why you let me
come up to your room last night.

268
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:05,842
Because it was your last day
in Hiroshima.

269
00:25:07,514 --> 00:25:10,745
Not at all.
The thought never crossed my mind.

270
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:15,480
When you speak, I wonder
whether you lie or tell the truth.

271
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:19,415
I lie... and I tell the truth.

272
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,927
But I have no reason to lie to you.

273
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:28,092
Tell me, do things like this
happen to you often?

274
00:25:29,302 --> 00:25:31,133
Not all that often.

275
00:25:31,271 --> 00:25:33,466
But they happen.

276
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:37,376
I'm very fond of men.

277
00:25:39,979 --> 00:25:42,709
I have dubious morals, you know.

278
00:25:43,316 --> 00:25:46,843
What do you call
having "dubious morals"?

279
00:25:47,454 --> 00:25:50,048
Being dubious
about other people's morals.

280
00:25:57,864 --> 00:26:00,355
I'd like to see you again.

281
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,764
Even if your plane leaves tomorrow morning.
Even if you have dubious morals.

282
00:26:07,807 --> 00:26:09,365
Why?

283
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:11,910
Because.

284
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:28,293
You don't want
to talk to me anymore?

285
00:26:32,198 --> 00:26:34,564
I'd like to see you again.

286
00:26:44,077 --> 00:26:46,375
Where are you going in France?
Nevers?

287
00:26:46,446 --> 00:26:49,847
No, Paris.
I'm never going back to Nevers.

288
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:52,309
- Never?
- Never.

289
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:57,123
I was never younger
than I was in Nevers.

290
00:26:57,891 --> 00:26:59,882
Young in Nevers.

291
00:27:01,294 --> 00:27:03,387
Young in Nevers.

292
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:07,967
And mad in Nevers too.

293
00:27:23,449 --> 00:27:27,545
You see, Nevers
is the one city in the world... -

294
00:27:28,154 --> 00:27:31,590
the one thing in the world... -
I dream of most at night

295
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:37,061
and at the same time
think about the least.

296
00:27:38,264 --> 00:27:40,698
What was this madness
of yours in Nevers like?

297
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:46,061
Madness is like intelligence.

298
00:27:46,606 --> 00:27:50,337
You can't explain it.
just like intelligence.

299
00:27:50,443 --> 00:27:53,970
It comes over you, consumes you,

300
00:27:54,614 --> 00:27:56,377
and then you understand.

301
00:27:56,449 --> 00:27:59,350
But when it's none,
you no longer understand it at all.

302
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:01,520
Were you full of hate?

303
00:28:01,588 --> 00:28:03,419
That was my madness.

304
00:28:03,523 --> 00:28:05,855
I was mad with hate.

305
00:28:06,459 --> 00:28:10,793
I felt I could make a career of hating.

306
00:28:10,964 --> 00:28:13,694
All I cared about was hating.

307
00:28:13,933 --> 00:28:16,060
Do you understand?
- Yes.

308
00:28:18,404 --> 00:28:21,771
It's true. I guess you must
understand that too.

309
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:24,635
Did it ever happen to you again?

310
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,872
It's over.

311
00:28:28,948 --> 00:28:30,711
During the war?

312
00:28:30,783 --> 00:28:32,375
Right after it.

313
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:37,716
Was that one of the hardships
of life in France after the war?

314
00:28:38,191 --> 00:28:40,819
You could say that.

315
00:28:41,027 --> 00:28:44,121
When did this madness of yours pass?

316
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:47,863
It went away little by little,
and then when I had children, of course.

317
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,561
What did you say?

318
00:28:49,702 --> 00:28:53,695
I said it went away little by little,
and then when I had children, of course.

319
00:28:58,211 --> 00:29:02,875
I'd like to spend a few days with you
somewhere sometime.

320
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:06,248
Me too.

321
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:08,981
To see you again today
wouldn't really be "seeing you again."

322
00:29:09,055 --> 00:29:12,616
Such a short time doesn't count.
I really would like to.

323
00:29:22,035 --> 00:29:23,525
Very well.

324
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,565
It's because
you know I'm leaving tomorrow.

325
00:29:29,709 --> 00:29:32,303
That may be part of it.

326
00:29:32,378 --> 00:29:34,903
But it's as good a reason
as any, isn't it?

327
00:29:36,282 --> 00:29:41,743
The thought of never seeing you again
in just a few hours... -

328
00:30:28,534 --> 00:30:32,061
You were easy to find in Hiroshima.

329
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:42,541
Is it a French film?

330
00:30:43,015 --> 00:30:46,610
No. International.
It's about peace.

331
00:30:46,853 --> 00:30:49,845
- Is it finished?
- It is for me.

332
00:30:50,256 --> 00:30:52,156
There are some crowd scenes
left to shoot.

333
00:30:54,927 --> 00:30:58,021
There are lots of commercials
for soap.

334
00:30:58,097 --> 00:31:00,622
Maybe by pressing the point... -

335
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:02,462
Yes, maybe.

336
00:31:02,668 --> 00:31:06,536
Here in Hiroshima we don't
make fun of films about peace.

337
00:31:21,187 --> 00:31:23,018
Are you tired?

338
00:31:28,728 --> 00:31:30,593
No more than you.

339
00:31:32,231 --> 00:31:34,927
I've been thinking
about Nevers in France.

340
00:31:36,402 --> 00:31:38,393
I've been thinking about you.

341
00:31:40,473 --> 00:31:42,566
Is your flight still tomorrow?

342
00:31:42,642 --> 00:31:44,974
- Yes.
- Without fail?

343
00:31:45,044 --> 00:31:48,104
Yes. The picture is behind schedule.

344
00:31:48,347 --> 00:31:50,838
I was supposed to be in Paris
a month ago.

345
00:32:15,641 --> 00:32:20,476
You give me
a tremendous desire to love.

346
00:32:23,015 --> 00:32:25,006
Always.

347
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,817
Short-lived affairs.

348
00:32:30,056 --> 00:32:31,887
Me too.

349
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:43,164
It's not always this strong,
and you know it.

350
00:32:52,311 --> 00:32:56,509
They say there's a storm coming
before nightfall.

351
00:33:06,125 --> 00:33:10,357
IF ONE A-BOMB EQUALS
20,000 ORDINARY BOMBS,

352
00:33:18,004 --> 00:33:21,201
AND AN H-BOMB EQUALS
1,500 ATOMIC BOMBS,

353
00:33:29,148 --> 00:33:32,083
HOW MUCH DO THE 40,000
A-BOMBS AND H-BOMBS

354
00:33:32,251 --> 00:33:35,516
CURRENTLY STOCKPILED
IN THE WORLD EQUAL?

355
00:33:35,588 --> 00:33:40,355
THEY ARE A TRIBUTE
TO MAN'S SCIENTIFIC GENIUS.

356
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,551
BUT UNFORTUNATELY
MAN'S POLITICAL I INTELLIGENCE

357
00:33:43,629 --> 00:33:46,689
IS 100 TI MES LESS DEVELOPED
THAN HIS SCIENTIFIC INTELLIGENCE,

358
00:33:49,535 --> 00:33:52,470
AND FOR THAT REASON
HE FORFEITS OUR RESPECT.

359
00:33:52,538 --> 00:33:55,029
STOP THERMONUCLEAR TESTING!

360
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:29,874
I don't like to think
about you leaving tomorrow.

361
00:35:05,745 --> 00:35:08,236
I think I love you.

362
00:35:45,317 --> 00:35:48,684
You will come with me once more.

363
00:36:01,567 --> 00:36:03,558
Answer me.

364
00:36:04,904 --> 00:36:06,838
Are you afraid?

365
00:37:20,212 --> 00:37:21,975
Sit down.

366
00:37:25,484 --> 00:37:27,850
Are you all alone in Hiroshima?

367
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,345
Where is your wife?

368
00:37:30,823 --> 00:37:34,759
She's in Unzen, in the mountains.
I'm alone.

369
00:37:35,828 --> 00:37:37,921
When is she coming back?

370
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,961
In a few days.

371
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,942
What is your wife like?

372
00:37:55,014 --> 00:37:56,845
Beautiful.

373
00:37:57,149 --> 00:38:00,516
I'm a man
who's happy with his wife.

374
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:04,183
So am I.

375
00:38:04,723 --> 00:38:07,283
I'm a woman
who's happy with her husband.

376
00:38:08,627 --> 00:38:10,652
It would have been too easy.

377
00:38:13,132 --> 00:38:16,158
- Don't you work in the afternoon?
- Yes, a lot.

378
00:38:16,368 --> 00:38:18,836
Mostly in the afternoon.

379
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:27,071
This whole thing is ridiculous.

380
00:38:58,277 --> 00:39:00,768
Are you giving up your afternoon
because of me?

381
00:39:02,414 --> 00:39:04,678
Tell me.
What difference can it make?

382
00:39:13,058 --> 00:39:17,495
The man you loved during the war... -
was he French?

383
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:27,863
He wasn't French.

384
00:39:37,616 --> 00:39:39,311
Yes.

385
00:39:40,319 --> 00:39:42,617
It was in Nevers.

386
00:40:39,011 --> 00:40:42,105
At first we met in barns.

387
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:47,075
Then among the ruins.

388
00:40:49,722 --> 00:40:52,190
Then in rooms.

389
00:40:52,291 --> 00:40:54,191
Like anywhere else.

390
00:41:13,979 --> 00:41:15,844
Then he died.

391
00:41:23,655 --> 00:41:25,850
I was 18.

392
00:41:26,058 --> 00:41:28,322
He was 23.

393
00:42:09,501 --> 00:42:13,494
Why speak of him and not others?

394
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,540
- Why not?
- No! Why?

395
00:42:17,009 --> 00:42:19,443
Because of Nevers.

396
00:42:20,279 --> 00:42:23,407
I'm only just beginning
to know you,

397
00:42:24,016 --> 00:42:28,646
and from the many thousands
of things in your life,

398
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,688
I choose Nevers.

399
00:42:30,856 --> 00:42:32,881
just like that?

400
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:35,986
- Yes.
- No, it wasn't by chance.

401
00:42:36,061 --> 00:42:38,427
You have to tell me why.

402
00:42:39,798 --> 00:42:44,201
I somehow understand
that it was there

403
00:42:44,736 --> 00:42:48,604
that you were so young

404
00:42:49,308 --> 00:42:52,436
that you didn't yet belong
to anyone in particular,

405
00:42:52,511 --> 00:42:54,672
and I like that.

406
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:57,039
No, that's not it.

407
00:43:00,752 --> 00:43:04,119
I somehow understand
that it was there

408
00:43:04,289 --> 00:43:07,383
that I almost lost you

409
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:12,123
and ran the risk
of never, ever meeting you.

410
00:43:12,998 --> 00:43:16,399
I somehow understand
that it was there

411
00:43:16,602 --> 00:43:22,302
that you began to be
who you are today.

412
00:43:51,236 --> 00:43:53,727
I want to leave this place!

413
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:01,802
There's nothing left for us to do now

414
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:06,010
but kill the hours until your departure.

415
00:44:06,485 --> 00:44:09,511
Sixteen hours until your flight.

416
00:44:11,757 --> 00:44:13,782
It's too much!

417
00:44:15,127 --> 00:44:17,186
You mustn't be afraid.

418
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:05,601
Does "Nevers" have
any other meaning in French?

419
00:45:06,945 --> 00:45:08,742
No.

420
00:45:09,281 --> 00:45:14,014
Would you have been cold
in that cellar in Nevers

421
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:16,350
if we had loved each other?

422
00:45:16,655 --> 00:45:19,055
I would have been cold.

423
00:45:19,891 --> 00:45:23,691
The cellars in Nevers are cold
both summer and winter.

424
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:28,893
The city slopes down to a river
called the Loire.

425
00:45:29,868 --> 00:45:32,496
<i>I can't picture Nevers.</i>

426
00:45:32,638 --> 00:45:36,074
<i>Nevers. Population 40,000.</i>

427
00:45:36,508 --> 00:45:38,942
<i>Built like a capital.</i>

428
00:45:39,244 --> 00:45:41,906
<i>A child can walk</i>
<i>all the way around it.</i>

429
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,105
<i>I was born in Nevers.</i>

430
00:45:50,188 --> 00:45:52,418
I grew up in Nevers.

431
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:57,888
I learned to read in Nevers.

432
00:46:02,234 --> 00:46:06,227
That's where I turned 20.

433
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:14,269
And the Loire?

434
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:19,617
It's a completely unnavigable river.

435
00:46:19,851 --> 00:46:21,876
It's always empty

436
00:46:22,521 --> 00:46:26,423
due to its irregular course
and sand bars.

437
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:32,721
In France it's considered
a very beautiful river,

438
00:46:34,566 --> 00:46:37,967
due mostly to its light.

439
00:46:40,305 --> 00:46:43,001
So very soft.

440
00:46:43,508 --> 00:46:45,908
If you only knew.

441
00:46:52,984 --> 00:46:56,283
When you're in the cellar, am I dead?

442
00:46:56,755 --> 00:46:58,416
You're dead.

443
00:47:03,762 --> 00:47:05,753
How can anyone endure such pain?

444
00:47:10,135 --> 00:47:12,103
The cellar is small.

445
00:47:13,105 --> 00:47:15,266
<i>Very small.</i>

446
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:19,806
The Marseillaise passes
above my head.

447
00:47:21,113 --> 00:47:22,671
It's deafening!

448
00:47:29,688 --> 00:47:32,680
Hands become useless in a cellar.

449
00:47:34,626 --> 00:47:38,289
<i>They claw</i>
<i>and scrape away at the rocks</i>

450
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:41,457
<i>until they bleed.</i>

451
00:47:44,169 --> 00:47:47,969
<i>It's all you can think of</i>
<i>to help yourself</i>

452
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,170
<i>and to remember.</i>

453
00:47:53,311 --> 00:47:56,838
<i>I loved blood since I had tasted yours.</i>

454
00:48:14,032 --> 00:48:17,092
The world passes by above my head,

455
00:48:17,702 --> 00:48:21,035
in place of the sky, of course.

456
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,073
I watch that world pass by.

457
00:48:25,544 --> 00:48:28,672
Hurriedly during the week,

458
00:48:29,181 --> 00:48:32,082
<i>leisurely on Sundays.</i>

459
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:36,819
<i>It doesn't know I'm in the cellar.</i>

460
00:48:37,489 --> 00:48:40,049
They pretend I'm dead.

461
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:42,855
Dead, far from Nevers.

462
00:48:47,165 --> 00:48:50,965
<i>My father prefers it that way,</i>
<i>since I was disgraced.</i>

463
00:48:51,536 --> 00:48:53,936
<i>My father prefers...</i>

464
00:48:55,774 --> 00:48:57,503
Do you scream?

465
00:48:58,076 --> 00:49:00,636
<i>Not in the beginning.</i>

466
00:49:00,745 --> 00:49:02,645
<i>I call your name softly.</i>

467
00:49:02,714 --> 00:49:05,512
- <i>But I'm dead.</i>
- <i>I call your name anyway.</i>

468
00:49:05,584 --> 00:49:07,449
<i>Even if you're dead.</i>

469
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:10,488
<i>Then one day, I suddenly scream.</i>

470
00:49:10,555 --> 00:49:13,581
<i>Loud, like a deaf person.</i>

471
00:49:14,626 --> 00:49:16,719
<i>That's when they put me in the cellar.</i>

472
00:49:16,795 --> 00:49:18,763
<i>To punish me.</i>

473
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:23,491
- <i>What did you scream?</i>
- <i>Your German name. Just your name.</i>

474
00:49:24,669 --> 00:49:29,129
<i>The only memory I have left</i>
<i>is your name.</i>

475
00:49:32,611 --> 00:49:35,409
<i>I promise I won't scream anymore,</i>

476
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:38,606
<i>so they take me back up to my room.</i>

477
00:49:41,386 --> 00:49:45,584
<i>I yearn for you so badly</i>
<i>I can't bear it anymore.</i>

478
00:49:46,625 --> 00:49:48,889
- <i>Are you afraid?</i>
- <i>I'm afraid everywhere.</i>

479
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,928
<i>In the cellar. In my room.</i>

480
00:49:54,699 --> 00:49:58,635
- Of what?
- Of never seeing you again.

481
00:49:59,938 --> 00:50:01,838
Ever.

482
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:09,540
I turn 20 one day in the cellar.

483
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:13,680
My mother comes
and tells me I'm 20 years old.

484
00:50:15,487 --> 00:50:17,614
My mother's crying.

485
00:50:17,689 --> 00:50:20,249
Do you spit in your mother's face?

486
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:22,690
Yes.

487
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,065
Drink.

488
00:50:38,777 --> 00:50:41,075
Afterwards, I don't remember anymore.

489
00:50:43,348 --> 00:50:45,543
I don't remember anymore.

490
00:50:47,185 --> 00:50:53,920
You were saying the cellars
in Nevers are old and damp?

491
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:58,722
<i>Yes, full of saltpeter.</i>

492
00:51:02,467 --> 00:51:05,368
Sometimes a cat comes in
to have a look around.

493
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:07,795
It doesn't bother me.

494
00:51:09,841 --> 00:51:12,173
I don't remember anymore.

495
00:51:12,544 --> 00:51:14,637
Afterwards, I don't remember anymore.

496
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:17,274
How long?
7

497
00:51:18,583 --> 00:51:20,642
<i>An eternity.</i>

498
00:52:13,772 --> 00:52:16,741
I was so young once!

499
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,614
At night my mother
takes me into the garden.

500
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,956
She looks at my head.

501
00:52:36,561 --> 00:52:40,258
Every night she looks
carefully at my head.

502
00:52:42,167 --> 00:52:45,432
She still doesn't dare come close.

503
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:50,132
At night I can see the town square.

504
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:53,200
So I look.

505
00:52:54,279 --> 00:52:56,509
It's huge.

506
00:52:58,483 --> 00:53:01,043
It curves in the middle.

507
00:53:02,787 --> 00:53:05,756
<i>Sleep comes only at dawn.</i>

508
00:53:07,792 --> 00:53:10,625
Does it ever rain?

509
00:53:12,664 --> 00:53:15,064
Along the walls.

510
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:22,669
I think of you,

511
00:53:23,641 --> 00:53:26,007
but I no longer speak of it.

512
00:53:26,377 --> 00:53:28,277
Madwoman!

513
00:53:31,282 --> 00:53:34,615
Madly in love with you.

514
00:53:39,124 --> 00:53:41,684
My hair grows back.

515
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:45,952
I can feel it with my hands, day by day.

516
00:53:46,131 --> 00:53:48,395
I don't care.

517
00:53:48,867 --> 00:53:51,893
<i>But still, it's growing back.</i>

518
00:53:55,206 --> 00:53:57,970
Do you scream
before going down to the cellar?

519
00:53:58,877 --> 00:54:01,573
No. I feel nothing.

520
00:54:01,746 --> 00:54:03,236
They're young.

521
00:54:04,048 --> 00:54:06,778
<i>They shave my head carefully</i>
<i>till they finish the job.</i>

522
00:54:07,051 --> 00:54:09,918
<i>They believe it's their duty.</i>

523
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:12,783
<i>Are you ashamed for them, my love?</i>

524
00:54:15,193 --> 00:54:16,888
<i>You are dead.</i>

525
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:20,355
<i>I'm too busy suffering.</i>

526
00:54:21,566 --> 00:54:24,330
<i>Night falls.</i>

527
00:54:25,737 --> 00:54:29,673
I hear nothing but the sound
of the scissors on my head.

528
00:54:31,075 --> 00:54:37,241
It eases the pain
of your death a bit, like... -

529
00:54:38,116 --> 00:54:42,143
I don't know how else to say it... -

530
00:54:42,353 --> 00:54:47,188
like for my nails... the walls... my anger.

531
00:54:50,228 --> 00:54:52,662
What pain!

532
00:54:52,797 --> 00:54:55,095
What pain in my heart!

533
00:54:58,570 --> 00:55:01,368
They sing the Marseillaise
all through the town.

534
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:04,832
Night falls.

535
00:55:05,009 --> 00:55:07,603
My dead lover is an enemy of France.

536
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:12,578
Someone says she should be
paraded through town.

537
00:55:13,551 --> 00:55:17,612
My father's pharmacy is closed
due to the disgrace.

538
00:55:19,123 --> 00:55:21,557
I am alone.

539
00:55:22,227 --> 00:55:24,627
Some of them are laughing.

540
00:55:26,431 --> 00:55:29,059
I return home at night.

541
00:55:46,784 --> 00:55:51,653
And then one day, my love,
your eternity comes to an end.

542
00:55:59,998 --> 00:56:01,556
Yes.

543
00:56:03,635 --> 00:56:08,163
A long time.
They said it was a long time.

544
00:56:10,808 --> 00:56:16,508
<i>The cathedral bells ring at 6:00</i>
<i>every evening, summer and winter.</i>

545
00:56:17,282 --> 00:56:20,649
<i>One day I hear them.</i>

546
00:56:21,052 --> 00:56:24,488
<i>I remember having heard them before.</i>

547
00:56:24,656 --> 00:56:27,682
<i>Before, when we were in love,</i>

548
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:30,319
<i>when we were happy.</i>

549
00:56:31,863 --> 00:56:33,854
<i>I begin to see.</i>

550
00:56:34,332 --> 00:56:37,699
<i>I remember having seen before,</i>

551
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:40,499
<i>when we were in love,</i>

552
00:56:40,638 --> 00:56:43,129
<i>when we were happy.</i>

553
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:46,467
<i>I remember.</i>

554
00:56:46,711 --> 00:56:48,770
<i>I see the ink.</i>

555
00:56:48,846 --> 00:56:51,144
<i>I see the daylight.</i>

556
00:56:51,749 --> 00:56:55,207
<i>I see my life. Your death.</i>

557
00:56:55,486 --> 00:56:59,081
<i>My life that goes on,</i>
<i>your death that goes on.</i>

558
00:56:59,891 --> 00:57:05,124
<i>I see that the shadows take longer</i>
<i>to reach the corners of the room</i>

559
00:57:06,831 --> 00:57:12,428
<i>and the corners of the cellar.</i>

560
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:16,137
<i>About half past six.</i>

561
00:57:20,144 --> 00:57:22,578
<i>Winter has ended.</i>

562
00:57:31,923 --> 00:57:33,823
It's horrible!

563
00:57:34,025 --> 00:57:36,789
I remember you
less and less clearly.

564
00:57:38,896 --> 00:57:41,160
Give me something to drink.

565
00:57:49,974 --> 00:57:52,602
I begin to forget you.

566
00:57:54,379 --> 00:57:57,542
I tremble at forgetting such love.

567
00:57:59,283 --> 00:58:01,183
More.

568
00:58:17,802 --> 00:58:22,330
We were to meet at noon
on the banks of the Loire.

569
00:58:23,775 --> 00:58:26,608
I was to leave with him.

570
00:58:27,912 --> 00:58:30,745
<i>When I arrived at noon</i>
<i>on the banks of the Loire,</i>

571
00:58:32,216 --> 00:58:34,150
<i>he wasn't quite dead yet.</i>

572
00:58:34,519 --> 00:58:37,420
<i>Someone had fired on him</i>
<i>from a garden.</i>

573
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:44,560
I stayed by his body all that day

574
00:58:46,264 --> 00:58:49,427
and all the following night.

575
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:58,035
The next morning, they came
to net him and put him in a truck.

576
00:58:59,811 --> 00:59:03,178
Nevers was liberated that night.

577
00:59:06,617 --> 00:59:12,249
The cathedral bells rang and rang.

578
00:59:15,293 --> 00:59:18,854
He grew cold beneath me,
little by little.

579
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:25,360
He took so long to die!

580
00:59:27,171 --> 00:59:29,230
When?

581
00:59:29,507 --> 00:59:31,975
I don't know exactly.

582
00:59:32,677 --> 00:59:35,646
I was lying on top of him.

583
00:59:39,517 --> 00:59:42,918
The moment of his death
actually escaped me,

584
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:50,758
because at that moment
and even afterwards... -

585
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:54,890
yes, I can even say afterwards... -

586
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:58,958
I couldn't find
the slightest difference

587
00:59:59,036 --> 01:00:01,504
between his dead body and my own.

588
01:00:05,009 --> 01:00:08,240
His body and mine

589
01:00:09,447 --> 01:00:12,382
seemed to me to be
one and the same.

590
01:00:13,284 --> 01:00:17,220
You understand?
He was my first love!

591
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:38,473
Then one day I screamed again,

592
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:41,470
<i>so they put me back in the cellar.</i>

593
01:00:55,226 --> 01:00:57,524
<i>It was warm.</i>

594
01:01:02,066 --> 01:01:05,866
<i>I think it was then</i>
<i>that my hatred left me.</i>

595
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:10,303
I don't scream anymore.

596
01:01:10,641 --> 01:01:13,337
I become reasonable.

597
01:01:14,145 --> 01:01:18,081
They say, "She's become reasonable."

598
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:23,911
One holiday evening

599
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:26,948
they let me out.

600
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:30,990
<i>The banks of the Loire at dawn.</i>

601
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:34,156
<i>People cross the bridge,</i>

602
01:01:34,332 --> 01:01:36,823
<i>in greater or smaller numbers,</i>
<i>depending on the hour.</i>

603
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:38,766
<i>From afar they're nobody.</i>

604
01:01:39,870 --> 01:01:42,065
<i>It isn't long after that</i>

605
01:01:42,139 --> 01:01:46,633
<i>that my mother tells me I must</i>
<i>leave for Paris during the night.</i>

606
01:01:47,511 --> 01:01:49,570
<i>She gives me some money.</i>

607
01:01:51,415 --> 01:01:55,044
<i>I take off for Paris</i>
<i>one night on a bicycle.</i>

608
01:01:56,454 --> 01:01:59,548
<i>It's summer, and the nights are warm.</i>

609
01:02:12,236 --> 01:02:14,397
<i>When I get to Paris two days later,</i>

610
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:18,006
<i>Hiroshima is in all the papers.</i>

611
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:22,702
<i>My hair has grown back</i>
<i>to a decent length.</i>

612
01:02:22,913 --> 01:02:25,746
<i>I'm among the crowds in the street.</i>

613
01:02:30,488 --> 01:02:33,480
Fourteen years have passed.

614
01:03:05,256 --> 01:03:08,248
I don't even remember
his hands very well.

615
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,422
I still remember the pain a little bit.

616
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:14,495
Tonight?

617
01:03:14,932 --> 01:03:17,526
Yes, I remember it tonight.

618
01:03:19,036 --> 01:03:21,869
But one day
I will no longer remember it.

619
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:24,141
At all.

620
01:03:25,042 --> 01:03:27,237
Nothing.

621
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:33,848
Tomorrow at this time

622
01:03:34,618 --> 01:03:38,179
I'll be thousands of miles from you.

623
01:03:40,391 --> 01:03:43,918
Does your husband know this story?

624
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:51,198
So I'm the only one?

625
01:03:52,403 --> 01:03:54,268
Yes.

626
01:04:01,479 --> 01:04:04,915
I'm the only one who knows!

627
01:04:04,982 --> 01:04:06,916
Be quiet.

628
01:04:41,519 --> 01:04:44,249
It's so nice sometimes
to be with someone!

629
01:04:46,924 --> 01:04:48,585
Yes.

630
01:04:55,299 --> 01:04:57,426
Tell me more.

631
01:04:58,602 --> 01:05:00,001
Tell me.

632
01:05:07,511 --> 01:05:10,969
In a few years,
when I have forgotten you,

633
01:05:11,816 --> 01:05:15,513
and other adventures like this one

634
01:05:15,586 --> 01:05:20,717
will happen to me
from sheer force of habit,

635
01:05:22,159 --> 01:05:27,688
I'll remember you
as the symbol of love's forgetfulness.

636
01:05:28,165 --> 01:05:31,965
I'll think of this story
as of the horror of forgetting.

637
01:05:32,136 --> 01:05:34,263
I already know it.

638
01:05:39,076 --> 01:05:43,172
Don't things ever stop
at night in Hiroshima?

639
01:05:44,114 --> 01:05:46,912
No, they never stop.

640
01:05:48,619 --> 01:05:50,484
I like that.

641
01:05:51,355 --> 01:05:54,950
Cities where there's always
someone awake,

642
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:58,553
day or night.

643
01:07:25,849 --> 01:07:30,684
Sometimes we have to avoid thinking
about the problems life presents.

644
01:07:31,822 --> 01:07:35,485
Otherwise we'd suffocate.

645
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:45,268
Get away from me.

646
01:07:45,869 --> 01:07:48,770
The sun hasn't risen yet.

647
01:07:53,744 --> 01:07:57,703
We'll probably die
without ever seeing each other again.

648
01:07:59,516 --> 01:08:02,007
Yes, probably.

649
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:06,412
Unless, perhaps, one day...

650
01:08:07,791 --> 01:08:09,554
a war...

651
01:08:11,795 --> 01:08:13,592
Yes.

652
01:08:14,465 --> 01:08:16,296
A war.

653
01:11:06,270 --> 01:11:08,602
<i>You think you know,</i>

654
01:11:09,573 --> 01:11:11,768
<i>but no.</i>

655
01:11:12,176 --> 01:11:14,041
<i>Never.</i>

656
01:11:21,919 --> 01:11:26,015
In her youth in Nevers
she had a German love.

657
01:11:28,425 --> 01:11:31,656
We'll no to Bavaria, my love,

658
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:34,620
and we'll net married.

659
01:11:36,466 --> 01:11:39,435
She never went to Bavaria.

660
01:11:42,172 --> 01:11:45,972
Let those who never went to Bavaria
dare speak to her of love!

661
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:50,340
<i>You were not quite dead yet.</i>

662
01:11:50,948 --> 01:11:53,508
<i>I told our story.</i>

663
01:11:54,151 --> 01:11:57,450
<i>I cheated on you tonight</i>
<i>with that stranger.</i>

664
01:11:57,688 --> 01:12:00,452
<i>I told our story.</i>

665
01:12:00,624 --> 01:12:03,184
<i>You see, it was there to tell.</i>

666
01:12:03,393 --> 01:12:08,831
Fourteen years since I've tasted
an impossible love!

667
01:12:10,033 --> 01:12:12,001
Since Nevers.

668
01:12:12,169 --> 01:12:14,194
<i>Look how I'm forgetting you.</i>

669
01:12:14,471 --> 01:12:16,439
<i>Look how I've forgotten you.</i>

670
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:18,674
<i>Look at me.</i>

671
01:13:06,823 --> 01:13:09,087
<i>I'm going to stay in Hiroshima.</i>

672
01:13:09,927 --> 01:13:13,124
<i>With him. Every night.</i>

673
01:13:13,630 --> 01:13:16,098
<i>In Hiroshima.</i>

674
01:13:16,166 --> 01:13:19,658
<i>I'm going to stay here. Here.</i>

675
01:13:30,347 --> 01:13:33,339
Stay in Hiroshima.

676
01:13:34,818 --> 01:13:39,278
Of course I'll stay in Hiroshima

677
01:13:40,857 --> 01:13:42,848
with you.

678
01:13:46,229 --> 01:13:48,925
I'm so miserable!

679
01:13:50,033 --> 01:13:53,594
I wasn't expecting this at all.
You understand?

680
01:14:05,082 --> 01:14:06,913
Go away!

681
01:14:09,486 --> 01:14:11,886
I couldn't possibly leave you.

682
01:14:36,713 --> 01:14:40,274
Stay in Hiroshima with me.

683
01:14:47,758 --> 01:14:50,488
<i>He's going to walk towards me.</i>

684
01:14:51,128 --> 01:14:53,926
<i>He's going to take me by the shoulders.</i>

685
01:14:55,165 --> 01:14:57,292
<i>He's going to kiss me.</i>

686
01:14:58,268 --> 01:15:01,965
<i>He's going to kiss me and I'll be lost.</i>

687
01:16:05,535 --> 01:16:07,662
<i>I meet you.</i>

688
01:16:08,071 --> 01:16:10,562
<i>I remember you.</i>

689
01:16:11,441 --> 01:16:14,535
<i>This city was tailor-made for love.</i>

690
01:16:15,479 --> 01:16:18,812
<i>You fit my body like a glove.</i>

691
01:16:19,649 --> 01:16:23,449
<i>Who are you? You're destroying me.</i>

692
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:25,782
<i>I was hungry.</i>

693
01:16:25,856 --> 01:16:27,790
<i>Hungry for infidelity,</i>

694
01:16:28,058 --> 01:16:32,051
<i>for adultery, for lies,</i>

695
01:16:32,129 --> 01:16:33,960
<i>and for death.</i>

696
01:16:34,030 --> 01:16:35,827
<i>I always have been.</i>

697
01:16:38,802 --> 01:16:42,135
<i>I had no doubt</i>
<i>you'd cross my path one day.</i>

698
01:16:42,839 --> 01:16:48,141
<i>I waited for you calmly,</i>
<i>with boundless impatience.</i>

699
01:16:51,014 --> 01:16:53,073
<i>Devour me.</i>

700
01:16:53,517 --> 01:16:55,781
<i>Deform me to your likeness,</i>

701
01:16:55,852 --> 01:16:59,344
<i>so that no one after you</i>
<i>will ever again understand</i>

702
01:16:59,422 --> 01:17:02,152
<i>the reason for so much desire.</i>

703
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:07,120
<i>We'll be alone, my love.</i>

704
01:17:07,531 --> 01:17:09,465
<i>Night will never end.</i>

705
01:17:10,133 --> 01:17:13,296
<i>The day will never dawn again</i>
<i>on anyone.</i>

706
01:17:13,570 --> 01:17:16,596
<i>Never again.</i>

707
01:17:16,873 --> 01:17:18,704
<i>At last.</i>

708
01:17:27,617 --> 01:17:29,949
<i>You're still destroying me.</i>

709
01:17:30,754 --> 01:17:32,949
<i>You're good for me.</i>

710
01:17:34,324 --> 01:17:39,023
<i>We'll mourn the departed day</i>
<i>in good conscience and with goodwill.</i>

711
01:17:39,529 --> 01:17:42,794
<i>There'll be nothing else for us to do</i>

712
01:17:43,099 --> 01:17:45,761
<i>but mourn the departed day.</i>

713
01:17:46,403 --> 01:17:50,499
<i>Time will pass. Only time.</i>

714
01:17:52,175 --> 01:17:54,575
<i>And a time will come</i>

715
01:17:55,545 --> 01:18:01,245
<i>when we can no longer name</i>
<i>what it is that binds us.</i>

716
01:18:03,186 --> 01:18:06,622
<i>Its name will gradually</i>
<i>be erased from our memory</i>

717
01:18:07,057 --> 01:18:10,891
<i>until it vanishes completely.</i>

718
01:18:42,993 --> 01:18:47,054
Perhaps there's a chance you'll stay.

719
01:18:48,398 --> 01:18:50,161
You know very well.

720
01:18:50,233 --> 01:18:52,963
Staying is even more impossible
than leaving.

721
01:18:53,036 --> 01:18:54,799
A week.

722
01:18:57,307 --> 01:18:58,899
Three days.

723
01:18:58,975 --> 01:19:01,239
Time enough for what?

724
01:19:01,311 --> 01:19:03,802
To live from it? To die from it?

725
01:19:03,947 --> 01:19:06,211
Time enough to know which.

726
01:19:07,384 --> 01:19:09,648
There is no such thing.

727
01:19:10,053 --> 01:19:13,284
Neither time enough to live from it,
nor time enough to die from it.

728
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:18,286
So I don't give a damn.

729
01:19:19,596 --> 01:19:24,329
I would prefer
you had died in Nevers.

730
01:19:25,535 --> 01:19:27,560
So would I.

731
01:19:28,838 --> 01:19:31,773
But I didn't die in Nevers.

732
01:20:23,827 --> 01:20:26,295
<i>Nevers, you whom I'd forgotten,</i>

733
01:20:26,496 --> 01:20:29,124
<i>tonight I'd like to see you again.</i>

734
01:20:30,533 --> 01:20:33,661
<i>Night after night,</i>
<i>month after month, I set you afire</i>

735
01:20:34,604 --> 01:20:37,698
<i>while my body was ablaze</i>
<i>with his memory.</i>

736
01:21:14,377 --> 01:21:18,507
<i>While my body is still ablaze</i>
<i>with the memory of you,</i>

737
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:22,112
<i>I'd like to see Nevers once again.</i>

738
01:21:22,552 --> 01:21:24,543
<i>The Loire.</i>

739
01:21:25,255 --> 01:21:28,520
<i>Lovely poplar trees of Nièvre,</i>

740
01:21:29,259 --> 01:21:31,386
<i>I give you up to oblivion.</i>

741
01:21:33,062 --> 01:21:35,792
<i>Dime-store romance,</i>

742
01:21:36,266 --> 01:21:38,291
<i>I consign you to oblivion.</i>

743
01:21:39,702 --> 01:21:44,730
<i>One night without you</i>
<i>and I waited for day to deliver me.</i>

744
01:21:45,842 --> 01:21:51,576
<i>One day without his eyes and she dies,</i>
<i>the young girl from Nevers,</i>

745
01:21:52,282 --> 01:21:54,978
<i>shameless young girl from Nevers.</i>

746
01:21:55,385 --> 01:21:59,321
<i>One day without his hands</i>
<i>and she knows the pain of love.</i>

747
01:21:59,789 --> 01:22:01,848
<i>Silly little girl</i>

748
01:22:01,925 --> 01:22:04,189
<i>who died of love in Nevers.</i>

749
01:22:04,294 --> 01:22:06,387
<i>Little girl from Nevers</i>
<i>with shaven head,</i>

750
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:09,125
<i>this evening</i>
<i>I relinquish you to oblivion.</i>

751
01:22:09,499 --> 01:22:12,195
<i>Dime-store romance.</i>

752
01:22:13,002 --> 01:22:18,497
<i>As it was with him,</i>
<i>forgetting will begin with your eyes.</i>

753
01:22:19,476 --> 01:22:24,937
<i>Then, as with him,</i>
<i>it will swallow your voice.</i>

754
01:22:26,349 --> 01:22:30,979
<i>Then, as with him,</i>
<i>it will consume you entirely,</i>

755
01:22:31,054 --> 01:22:33,113
<i>little by little.</i>

756
01:22:33,656 --> 01:22:37,251
<i>You will become a song.</i>

757
01:22:52,842 --> 01:22:55,333
Who is she?

758
01:22:55,912 --> 01:22:57,937
A Frenchwoman.

759
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:05,947
What's the matter?

760
01:23:08,858 --> 01:23:11,452
She's leaving Japan in a little while.

761
01:23:13,096 --> 01:23:18,466
We're sad at having
to leave each other.

762
01:28:39,055 --> 01:28:41,990
I had to come.

763
01:29:13,789 --> 01:29:16,383
I'll forget you.
I'm forgetting you already!

764
01:29:16,459 --> 01:29:19,394
Look how I'm forgetting you!
Look at me!

765
01:29:42,518 --> 01:29:44,713
That's your name.

766
01:29:45,121 --> 01:29:47,783
Yes, that's my name.

767
01:29:50,092 --> 01:29:53,960
And your name is Nevers.

768
01:29:54,497 --> 01:29:57,864
Nevers in France.

769
01:30:02,672 --> 01:30:05,664
THE END
