1
00:01:28,772 --> 00:01:31,707
I ask you now to pronounce judgment...

2
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:33,399
...on those accused.

3
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:37,176
On this...

4
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:41,511
This mindless aberration,
whose only means of expressión...

5
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:44,050
...are wanton violence and destruction.

6
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:46,583
On the woman, Ursa...

7
00:01:47,056 --> 00:01:50,287
...whose perversions
and unreasoning hatred of all mankind...

8
00:01:50,794 --> 00:01:54,355
...have threatened even the children
of the planet Krypton.

9
00:01:55,565 --> 00:01:58,295
Finally, General Zod.

10
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:00,698
Chief architect
of this intended revolution...

11
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,933
...and author of this insidious plot
to establish a new order amongst us...

12
00:02:06,309 --> 00:02:09,836
...with himself as absolute ruler.

13
00:02:10,814 --> 00:02:13,248
The decisión of the council
will now be heard.

14
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:14,713
<i>Guilty.</i>

15
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:16,912
<i>- Guilty.
- Guilty.</i>

16
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,480
<i>Guilty.</i>

17
00:02:22,826 --> 00:02:24,726
The vote must be unanimous, Jor-EI.

18
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:28,162
It has therefore
now become your decisión.

19
00:02:28,331 --> 00:02:30,663
You alone will condemn us if you wish...

20
00:02:30,834 --> 00:02:33,769
...and you alone
will be held responsible by me.

21
00:02:44,347 --> 00:02:46,815
You will bow down before me, Jor-EI.

22
00:02:46,983 --> 00:02:48,177
I swear it.

23
00:02:48,351 --> 00:02:53,345
No matter that it takes an eternity,
you will bow down before me!

24
00:02:53,523 --> 00:02:54,615
Both you...

25
00:02:54,891 --> 00:02:55,983
...and then one day...

26
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:58,059
...your heirs!

27
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:31,018
You will bow down before me!

28
00:03:32,996 --> 00:03:35,362
- Forgive me!
- I'll be back!

29
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:36,657
Forgive me!

30
00:04:09,732 --> 00:04:14,226
<i>Your mother Lara has sent you
three blankets, of red, yellow and blue.</i>

31
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,072
<i>Their protection
will ensure your strength.</i>

32
00:05:27,677 --> 00:05:31,613
It's kryptonite, Superman.
A little souvenir from the old hometown.

33
00:05:36,786 --> 00:05:41,348
You were great in your day, Superman.
But it just stands to reason...

34
00:05:41,524 --> 00:05:43,958
...when it came time
to cash in your chips...

35
00:05:44,127 --> 00:05:47,563
...this old, diseased maniac...

36
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,664
...would be your banker.

37
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,036
Mind over muscle.

38
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,000
Why did you kiss me first?

39
00:06:32,275 --> 00:06:35,301
It... I didn't think you'd let me later.

40
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,275
Stand aside, now.

41
00:08:14,443 --> 00:08:16,468
Free!

42
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:05,006
Nice fresh melons.
Nice fresh melons. Get them fresh here.

43
00:12:05,174 --> 00:12:08,041
Good for the cooking, huh?
Look at this, the best.

44
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,337
"Lex Luthor's scheme bombs.
Superman saves nation.

45
00:12:12,515 --> 00:12:15,951
Master criminal draws harsh sentence.
Exclusive story by Lois Lane.

46
00:12:16,118 --> 00:12:18,245
Photographs by James Olsen."

47
00:12:18,421 --> 00:12:21,618
Luthor, you never looked lovelier.

48
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:22,951
Lois, terrific job.

49
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,093
- Thanks, chief.
- Great story, really great.

50
00:12:25,261 --> 00:12:27,456
Hey, good morning, chief. You're late.

51
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:30,531
Yeah, Miss Lane, that's a great story.
One of the best.

52
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:35,033
Well, Jimmy, usually a picture isn't worth
a thousand words when I write the story...

53
00:12:35,204 --> 00:12:37,035
...but in this case, congratulations.

54
00:12:37,206 --> 00:12:38,571
- Yeah, thanks a lot.
- Yeah.

55
00:12:39,642 --> 00:12:43,078
There's Mr. Kent. Bet he wishes
he'd been around when it all happened.

56
00:12:43,245 --> 00:12:45,770
Clark, he's never around
when Superman appears.

57
00:12:45,948 --> 00:12:47,438
Poor guy.

58
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,252
- You got a page in the front?
- Yeah.

59
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,695
Miss Lane got the best story.

60
00:13:11,073 --> 00:13:13,007
Good morning, Lois.

61
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,673
Hi.

62
00:13:53,148 --> 00:13:55,446
Lane, Kent, get in here!

63
00:13:55,618 --> 00:13:57,449
Now, see, Jimmy,
you got me in trouble.

64
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,783
- We were talking.
- So long. A big mistake.

65
00:14:01,624 --> 00:14:03,956
Next time, don't do that to me.

66
00:14:04,293 --> 00:14:07,922
- Good morning, Lois. How are you today?
- Oh, I'm just super. Thanks.

67
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,758
- Good morning, Mr. White.
- I'm super.

68
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:13,299
- Yeah, morning. You're late, Kent.
- I know. I'm sorry, Mr. White.

69
00:14:13,469 --> 00:14:15,733
- I got stuck in traffic.
- Oh, that's a new one.

70
00:14:15,905 --> 00:14:17,668
- Excuse me?
- I mean, as opposed to:

71
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,298
"I was stuck in a phone booth" or
"I got locked into the men's bathroom."

72
00:14:21,477 --> 00:14:24,105
Lois, what are you talking about?
I'm sorry I was late.

73
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,044
If you two wanna bicker,
I have just the assignment for you.

74
00:14:27,216 --> 00:14:31,209
You're gonna pose as a honeymoon couple
to get an exposé on the newlywed racket.

75
00:14:31,387 --> 00:14:35,084
Some of those hotels are bilking
those poor kids for every cent they can get.

76
00:14:35,257 --> 00:14:38,488
Real human-interest stuff.
Make your Aunt Hattie cry her eyes out.

77
00:14:38,761 --> 00:14:41,787
- Newlyweds?
- That is a great idea, Mr. White.

78
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:45,593
- I'm sorry, but I'm in the middle of a series...
- I mean, it wouldn't take long.

79
00:14:45,768 --> 00:14:50,262
We could just fly right up there
and zoom back down again.

80
00:14:50,439 --> 00:14:52,703
No, Superman?

81
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:56,072
Yeah. If he'd give you two a ride,
maybe we could save a couple bucks.

82
00:14:56,345 --> 00:14:58,711
I gotta see young Olsen.
Six lousy photographs...

83
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:03,318
...and that kid's hitting me up for a raise.
- Excuse me. Mr. White? Could we talk?

84
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,009
Darn.

85
00:15:05,955 --> 00:15:08,856
You look like the cat who swallowed
the canary this morning.

86
00:15:09,024 --> 00:15:12,858
A canary? No, actually I was
thinking of something bigger...

87
00:15:13,028 --> 00:15:15,997
...something that flies,
something more in blue.

88
00:15:16,465 --> 00:15:18,433
Lois, as usual, I'm totally in the dark...

89
00:15:18,601 --> 00:15:21,832
Let me just turn on the lights
for you then.

90
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:25,502
Get the picture?

91
00:15:27,409 --> 00:15:31,004
I didn't put this together until
this morning. Which is really strange...

92
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,479
...because a good reporter isn't supposed to
let anything slip by her.

93
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:37,084
Well, that's very amusing. Yes.

94
00:15:37,252 --> 00:15:38,719
- Excuse me.
- Amusing?

95
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:43,290
- Yes, sirree, that's... That's very amusing.
- Amusing, huh?

96
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:47,621
Tall, broad shoulders...

97
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,055
...dark hair.

98
00:15:50,232 --> 00:15:53,167
Gotta give you credit,
you really had me fooled.

99
00:15:53,335 --> 00:15:55,929
And I'm nobody's fool...

100
00:15:56,739 --> 00:15:58,468
...Superman.

101
00:15:58,941 --> 00:16:00,272
Superman?

102
00:16:00,442 --> 00:16:04,606
You mean you think I'm Superman?

103
00:16:05,247 --> 00:16:08,375
- Willing to bet my life on it.
- Lois, you know, you are priceless.

104
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,542
Really. That is the single most
ridiculous thing I've ever...

105
00:16:12,955 --> 00:16:15,822
- Lois, what are you doing?
- You wouldn't let me die, Superman.

106
00:16:55,798 --> 00:16:59,461
- Oh, God.
- Help her out. Help her out.

107
00:16:59,868 --> 00:17:02,666
- Clark!
- Lois, what have you done?

108
00:17:03,072 --> 00:17:05,700
Clark, the... You're not...

109
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:11,643
Hey, Clark, you seen Lois?

110
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,380
She just stepped out for a minute.

111
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,794
This is how it ends for
the greatest criminal mind of our time.

112
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,236
Not with a whimper, not with a bang.

113
00:17:39,408 --> 00:17:41,933
How do they choose
to reward Lex Luthor...

114
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:44,045
...the greatest genius in this worid?

115
00:17:44,213 --> 00:17:48,115
Do they give him glory or treasure?
What, matter of fact, do they give him?

116
00:17:48,283 --> 00:17:52,379
Life plus 25, Luthor. Get to work.

117
00:17:56,692 --> 00:17:59,320
Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor.
It almost worked.

118
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:02,328
I mean, California almost
fell down, right in the ocean.

119
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,295
Millions of people was almost killed.

120
00:18:04,466 --> 00:18:07,663
If it hadn't been for that guy
Superman, that overgrown Boy Scout.

121
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:11,067
- I want my Liberace record back tonight.
- Tonight?

122
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:16,303
What are you gonna do with a guy like that?
He flies around so fast and everything.

123
00:18:17,312 --> 00:18:20,509
I mean, they can't even trace
that guy on that radar they got.

124
00:18:20,716 --> 00:18:23,651
Every time they try, he just flies off.

125
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:25,184
- Where?
- North.

126
00:18:25,387 --> 00:18:27,184
Why?

127
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,653
To ski?

128
00:18:28,824 --> 00:18:32,225
Otis, every man has his vulnerable point.

129
00:18:32,394 --> 00:18:35,625
Some, like you, Otis,
have more than one.

130
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:37,732
I didn't see Superman's in time.

131
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,529
But now, through patience,
invention, and skill...

132
00:18:42,571 --> 00:18:45,665
...my little black box
is just about ready.

133
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:49,072
Oh, that little black box in our cell?

134
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,140
That little black box, Mr. Luthor...

135
00:18:56,685 --> 00:18:58,585
...what's it for?

136
00:18:58,754 --> 00:19:04,556
That little black box goes beyond
any normal, conventional radar.

137
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:07,388
It tracks alpha waves.

138
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:12,560
Alpha waves. Yeah.

139
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:15,464
<i>I could've said it tracked pasta e fagioli,
couldn't I?</i>

140
00:19:15,637 --> 00:19:19,266
Oh, with garlic, Mr. Luthor. And butter.

141
00:19:19,441 --> 00:19:20,840
Boy.

142
00:19:24,012 --> 00:19:29,575
Those alpha waves will
take me north to his secret.

143
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:34,484
And when I have his secret,
I'll have Superman.

144
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:40,123
Slasher Fogelstein's a bed wetter.

145
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:48,702
Slasher Fogelstein's a bed wetter.
Pass it.

146
00:19:54,176 --> 00:19:56,110
Hi, Mr. Fogelstein.

147
00:19:56,578 --> 00:19:59,103
- Too fast. Can you get the speed right?

148
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:02,216
I told you, they installed those
three weeks ago.

149
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:04,140
Hey.

150
00:20:05,053 --> 00:20:09,251
You follow the bouncing ball for a while.
Thing's giving me a headache.

151
00:20:09,424 --> 00:20:12,518
Anyway, somebody's
gotta check up on those guys.

152
00:20:12,694 --> 00:20:15,527
Yeah, I keep on forgetting about them.

153
00:20:15,697 --> 00:20:18,461
How long they been up there, 45 days?

154
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,569
The whole worid's forgotten about it.

155
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,966
<i>Houston calling Artemis II.</i>

156
00:20:26,775 --> 00:20:29,608
<i>Houston calling Artemis II. Come in.</i>

157
00:20:29,778 --> 00:20:32,338
<i>Morning, Houston. Hold on, Nate.</i>

158
00:20:32,514 --> 00:20:34,448
<i>- Yo.
- How are things going?</i>

159
00:20:35,217 --> 00:20:37,685
All systems normal, Houston.

160
00:20:37,853 --> 00:20:40,754
Andy is out doing the geological survey.

161
00:20:40,923 --> 00:20:43,221
<i>More rocks. Nice.</i>

162
00:20:43,392 --> 00:20:46,486
And cosmonaut Boris
is getting some soil samples.

163
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,222
By the way, Boris and I are engaged.

164
00:20:49,731 --> 00:20:52,859
I had a feeling about you guys
when I saw your Rorschach tests.

165
00:20:53,035 --> 00:20:55,333
Just a little détente
humor there, Houston.

166
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,495
<i>Surface conditions unchanged?</i>

167
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,699
Well, it's mighty
pretty out there. Mighty...

168
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,903
<i>...pretty.
- Mighty pretty.</i>

169
00:21:05,113 --> 00:21:07,240
<i>Right.</i>

170
00:21:07,616 --> 00:21:09,481
<i>Look, Nate?</i>

171
00:21:09,651 --> 00:21:11,243
<i>Nate, wake up, will you?</i>

172
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,980
That's it. I'm dreaming.

173
00:21:14,156 --> 00:21:16,420
<i>Artemis, come in.</i>

174
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:20,686
Well, Houston, we seem to have
an unidentified flying object.

175
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,261
Unidentified?

176
00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:25,559
<i>- What does it look like?
- Well...</i>

177
00:21:25,734 --> 00:21:28,430
...a lot like a girl.

178
00:21:49,758 --> 00:21:51,555
You.

179
00:21:52,294 --> 00:21:55,786
- What kind of a creature are you?
- Just a man.

180
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,658
A man?

181
00:22:55,424 --> 00:22:58,154
What a fragile sort of life form this is.

182
00:23:23,518 --> 00:23:26,180
Houston, come in. Come in, Houston.

183
00:23:34,696 --> 00:23:36,095
Come in, Houston. Come in.

184
00:23:36,264 --> 00:23:37,891
Attempting manual liftoff.

185
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,328
Can somebody hear me?

186
00:23:39,801 --> 00:23:41,632
Houston!

187
00:23:42,637 --> 00:23:43,763
Come on.

188
00:23:46,641 --> 00:23:48,438
Come on, Houston!

189
00:23:49,311 --> 00:23:51,745
Oh, no. No!

190
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,145
Somebody help me!

191
00:24:00,722 --> 00:24:03,714
<i>- Artemis, Houston calling. Come in.
- What's going on?</i>

192
00:24:03,892 --> 00:24:07,328
- I don't know. We've lost contact.
- So?

193
00:24:07,496 --> 00:24:09,191
Well, we really...

194
00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:11,629
<i>Artemis, come in, please.</i>

195
00:24:13,969 --> 00:24:17,666
All right, which one of you guys
is using the hair dryer?

196
00:24:20,008 --> 00:24:24,843
Strange. I tore those
metal fibers like paper.

197
00:24:25,013 --> 00:24:28,949
And what he did was amazing.

198
00:24:29,117 --> 00:24:33,554
- Something is happening.
- Yes, to all of us.

199
00:24:35,757 --> 00:24:39,955
The closer we come to an
atmosphere with only one sun...

200
00:24:40,128 --> 00:24:41,959
...a yellow sun...

201
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:46,089
...the more our molecular
density gives us unlimited powers.

202
00:24:46,268 --> 00:24:48,065
They come from there.

203
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:50,227
A place called Houston.

204
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,805
Then we will go there too...

205
00:24:52,974 --> 00:24:54,908
...to rule.

206
00:24:55,377 --> 00:24:58,039
Finally, to rule.

207
00:25:08,523 --> 00:25:10,252
Three-eighty-two, out.

208
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:13,525
Three-eighty-three, out.

209
00:25:14,296 --> 00:25:16,560
Three-eighty-four, out.

210
00:25:17,532 --> 00:25:19,830
Three-eighty-five, out.

211
00:25:23,205 --> 00:25:25,537
Lights out, Luthor.

212
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,337
I said, lights out.

213
00:25:30,912 --> 00:25:34,609
You guys are about 10 seconds
away from solitary, you know that?

214
00:25:36,718 --> 00:25:38,743
I told you to...

215
00:25:54,236 --> 00:25:56,397
Freeze, freeze.

216
00:26:29,271 --> 00:26:31,171
Mr. Luthor.

217
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,998
- How we gonna get over that wall?
- How'd we get in?

218
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:38,370
- We flew in here, remember?
- That's how we'll get out.

219
00:26:38,546 --> 00:26:40,878
Oh, no, not that guy.

220
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,415
Did you just go "psst"?

221
00:26:46,588 --> 00:26:49,751
I wish I had, Mr. Luthor, before we left.

222
00:26:51,393 --> 00:26:53,657
Not that "psst," that "psst."

223
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,830
- Don't go "psst" when I go "psst."
- You do it.

224
00:27:03,338 --> 00:27:05,499
Go out there and find it.

225
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:10,667
- What am I looking for?
- You'll know when you see it.

226
00:27:21,856 --> 00:27:24,552
I think I found it.

227
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,596
What is it?

228
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,467
It's a ladder, you dummy.

229
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:37,670
Hi, Miss Teschmacher.

230
00:27:46,648 --> 00:27:47,808
Come on.

231
00:27:48,616 --> 00:27:52,245
Hurry up. Hurry up.

232
00:27:52,821 --> 00:27:55,051
Come on, hurry.

233
00:27:56,057 --> 00:27:58,423
Otis, hold that ladder. Hurry up.

234
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:02,427
<i>- Yard line, touchdown!
Oh, what a beautiful play.</i>

235
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:05,327
<i>But there's a marker downfield.
It could be against...</i>

236
00:28:10,905 --> 00:28:11,963
- Come up.
- Come on.

237
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,734
Here I come, Mr. Luthor.

238
00:28:16,511 --> 00:28:17,671
- Get off. Get off.
- Otis!

239
00:28:19,481 --> 00:28:22,177
- We're sinking!
- Get off, get off!

240
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,361
Very good,
Miss Teschmacher. Very good.

241
00:28:41,536 --> 00:28:44,232
- What am I doing here? Why am I here?
- Miss Teschmacher...

242
00:28:44,406 --> 00:28:46,306
...is this a philosophy seminar?

243
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,203
- No. This is a getaway.
- No.

244
00:28:48,376 --> 00:28:49,604
- Getaway.
- Right.

245
00:28:49,778 --> 00:28:52,770
It's ingenious. I don't know
where you got the inspiration from.

246
00:28:52,947 --> 00:28:54,676
I got it from you, Lex.

247
00:28:55,617 --> 00:28:57,551
Hot air rises.

248
00:28:59,421 --> 00:29:01,150
Would you like to take a trip?

249
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:03,586
A trip? A vacation.

250
00:29:03,758 --> 00:29:06,625
Lex, I can go shopping.
I can buy a bikini.

251
00:29:06,795 --> 00:29:09,195
You thought about me in a bikini
while in prison?

252
00:29:09,531 --> 00:29:11,863
No, I didn't, actually.

253
00:29:12,033 --> 00:29:15,298
I thought about you in a parka.

254
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,597
You thought about me in a parka?

255
00:29:17,772 --> 00:29:20,002
You are sick, Lex. You are really sick.

256
00:29:20,742 --> 00:29:22,232
That's possible.

257
00:29:26,047 --> 00:29:27,844
North, Miss Teschmacher.

258
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,210
Due north.

259
00:29:30,552 --> 00:29:32,076
Lex, north.

260
00:29:33,555 --> 00:29:35,750
That's what I said, due north.

261
00:29:36,257 --> 00:29:38,589
- That's what you said.
- I know I said I said that.

262
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,523
- I just heard it.
- Yes, Lex.

263
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:43,061
Don't repeat what I say
when I say something.

264
00:29:43,231 --> 00:29:45,392
- I won't repeat what you say.
- Okay, don't.

265
00:29:45,567 --> 00:29:47,831
Well, stop repeating me.

266
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,127
Excuse me.

267
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:23,865
Would you like to carry Mrs. Smith
over the threshold?

268
00:30:24,038 --> 00:30:25,801
It's sort of traditional.

269
00:30:25,974 --> 00:30:28,807
I can give you a hand
if you have trouble lifting.

270
00:30:28,977 --> 00:30:32,504
- No, of course not.
- Honey. Thanks, I'll walk.

271
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,079
Certainly, dear.

272
00:30:44,459 --> 00:30:46,324
Mush! Mush!

273
00:30:46,494 --> 00:30:48,519
I am mushing.

274
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:53,801
North, Miss Teschmacher.

275
00:30:53,968 --> 00:30:58,064
- North, north!
- Yes, Lex. North.

276
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:28,731
Oh, you must be wrong, Lex.
This couldn't be his home way up here.

277
00:31:28,903 --> 00:31:30,598
"Wrong, Lex."

278
00:31:30,772 --> 00:31:34,333
Miss Teschmacher, those are two words
we do not use in the same sentence.

279
00:31:34,509 --> 00:31:37,410
Well, it's funny there's no front door.

280
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:42,380
Miss Teschmacher, "funny" is a person
trying to smile without any teeth.

281
00:31:44,886 --> 00:31:45,875
Right.

282
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,521
All right, come on, Lex. Come on.

283
00:31:54,696 --> 00:31:56,561
Move out of the way.

284
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,429
- This way.
- It's this way.

285
00:32:00,602 --> 00:32:02,331
Lex, it's this way.

286
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,403
It's this way, Lex.

287
00:32:04,806 --> 00:32:07,934
- Come on. Come on.
- Get off!

288
00:32:11,613 --> 00:32:13,171
Come on.

289
00:32:25,093 --> 00:32:27,084
- Fantastic.
- Fantastic.

290
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,262
It's fantastic!

291
00:32:34,102 --> 00:32:37,868
The construction goes far beyond
any known architectural theory.

292
00:32:41,109 --> 00:32:43,407
- It's beautiful.
- It's beautiful.

293
00:32:43,945 --> 00:32:45,310
- Lex.
- I'll be all right.

294
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,175
No, me.

295
00:32:50,952 --> 00:32:52,886
Why can't you be more careful?

296
00:32:55,289 --> 00:32:56,950
- It's beautiful.
- Beautiful.

297
00:32:57,125 --> 00:32:59,559
- It has everything.
- Wrong.

298
00:33:00,995 --> 00:33:05,125
- Why didn't you go before we left?
- That was two days ago.

299
00:33:08,703 --> 00:33:10,295
Be careful, Lex.

300
00:33:13,174 --> 00:33:14,471
Get...!

301
00:33:15,476 --> 00:33:19,310
Frankly, I think this place
is a little boring. It's all white.

302
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,778
Why doesn't the guy
put up some pictures?

303
00:33:21,949 --> 00:33:24,474
Maybe some bullfighting posters.

304
00:33:28,489 --> 00:33:30,923
- Don't touch anything.
- Don't touch anything.

305
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:35,520
- Ice.
- I said, don't touch it.

306
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,630
- It's not ice.
- It looks like a crystal.

307
00:34:01,989 --> 00:34:06,824
<i>The virtuous spirit has no need
for thankful approval...</i>

308
00:34:07,028 --> 00:34:09,189
<i>- What the...?
...owning a certain conviction...</i>

309
00:34:09,363 --> 00:34:12,196
<i>... that what has been done is right.</i>

310
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,527
That's the old man.
He looks just like the kid.

311
00:34:14,702 --> 00:34:17,569
- Are you the old man?
- Ask him where the bathroom is.

312
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:20,173
<i>Develop such conviction in yourself.</i>

313
00:34:20,441 --> 00:34:21,669
Are you here?

314
00:34:21,876 --> 00:34:25,869
<i>- The human heart on your planet...
- He's not here.</i>

315
00:34:26,047 --> 00:34:30,381
It's a voice from the past.
That's cute. That's really cute. Nice.

316
00:34:30,551 --> 00:34:32,542
<i>Lies, monstrous deceptions.</i>

317
00:34:35,923 --> 00:34:38,391
So much for moral rearmament.

318
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:40,424
Give me another crystal.

319
00:34:50,304 --> 00:34:53,831
<i>Education crystal 108. Earth culture.</i>

320
00:34:54,609 --> 00:34:58,636
<i>A typical ode much loved by the people
you will live among, Kal-EI.</i>

321
00:34:58,813 --> 00:35:01,407
<i>Trees by Joyce Kilmer.</i>

322
00:35:01,983 --> 00:35:03,814
<i>I think that I shall never see</i>

323
00:35:03,985 --> 00:35:06,886
<i>A poem as lovely as a tree.</i>

324
00:35:08,823 --> 00:35:10,313
Come on, I like trees.

325
00:35:10,491 --> 00:35:12,925
So does your average cocker spaniel.
Give me another.

326
00:35:13,094 --> 00:35:14,789
Cute.

327
00:35:21,269 --> 00:35:22,395
<i>My son...</i>

328
00:35:22,737 --> 00:35:24,568
- The man never ages.
- Never ages.

329
00:35:24,739 --> 00:35:29,870
<i>... the time has come to tell you of
the darkest episode in Krypton history.</i>

330
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:32,774
<i>- Now, this I wanna hear.
- Unfortunately...</i>

331
00:35:32,947 --> 00:35:36,246
<i>... even on our peaceful planet...</i>

332
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,781
<i>... there have appeared
once in a great while...</i>

333
00:35:38,953 --> 00:35:42,218
<i>... certain antisocial elements.</i>

334
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:43,956
<i>Deviants...</i>

335
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:46,059
<i>... what you call on Earth "criminals."</i>

336
00:35:46,327 --> 00:35:47,555
Criminals.

337
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:50,219
Deviants. He was right in the first place.

338
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:53,367
<i>Though of course, we are not
a penalty planet like Earth...</i>

339
00:35:53,534 --> 00:35:57,095
<i>... and these unhappy souls were almost
always successfully transformed...</i>

340
00:35:57,271 --> 00:36:00,172
<i>...into productive citizens.
- You never heard of Lex Luthor?</i>

341
00:36:00,341 --> 00:36:03,674
<i>There were, however, three exceptions...
Only three.</i>

342
00:36:03,845 --> 00:36:06,541
<i>- Who proved impossible to rehabilitate.</i>

343
00:36:07,281 --> 00:36:08,373
There's hope.

344
00:36:08,549 --> 00:36:10,710
<i>Non, the destroyer.</i>

345
00:36:10,885 --> 00:36:15,185
<i>Unreasoning violence
in the shape of a being.</i>

346
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:19,924
<i>Ursa. Vicious, cruel, obsessed
by a single-minded hatred...</i>

347
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:22,119
<i>... which could never be determined.</i>

348
00:36:22,296 --> 00:36:24,264
<i>And the one force
that could unite them...</i>

349
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:28,994
<i>... the only one whose warped genius
could harness these forces of evil:</i>

350
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:30,432
<i>General Zod.</i>

351
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:33,472
<i>- He looks kind of cute.
- His intended insurrection...</i>

352
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:37,974
<i>... was the most painful episode
our people ever had to endure.</i>

353
00:36:38,412 --> 00:36:40,471
<i>But after a long and terrible battle...</i>

354
00:36:41,082 --> 00:36:43,744
<i>... peace and harmony
were once again restored.</i>

355
00:36:43,918 --> 00:36:45,442
Kind of an anticlimax.

356
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,987
<i>We had, of course, no death penalty.</i>

357
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:50,948
Sensible enough.

358
00:36:51,492 --> 00:36:54,518
<i>And so they were placed
in the Phantom Zone...</i>

359
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,528
<i>... to be imprisoned for all eternity.</i>

360
00:37:02,236 --> 00:37:05,467
<i>I do not know what could be done
if they were to escape.</i>

361
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,401
<i>On Krypton, these
villains were uncontrollable.</i>

362
00:37:08,576 --> 00:37:13,309
<i>On Earth, each of them
would have the identical powers...</i>

363
00:37:14,215 --> 00:37:15,978
<i>... that you have.</i>

364
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:20,846
Think of it. Three super villains.

365
00:37:21,022 --> 00:37:23,923
All three with the same power he has.

366
00:37:24,091 --> 00:37:28,255
All three totally dedicated
to corruption, violence, evil.

367
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:33,065
They need a contact on Earth.

368
00:37:33,267 --> 00:37:36,065
Someone who felt the same as they did,
someone who...

369
00:37:36,237 --> 00:37:40,674
...had the same wonderful contempt for
life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

370
00:37:41,475 --> 00:37:43,636
Too true to be good.

371
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,244
Right?

372
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,518
- Miss Teschmacher?
- I found it.

373
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,787
I think.

374
00:37:58,125 --> 00:38:01,424
- Where's Jimmy Olsen when I need him?
- Golly, isn't it beautiful?

375
00:38:01,595 --> 00:38:04,462
Yeah, it's gorgeous. Gorgeous.

376
00:38:04,665 --> 00:38:05,927
- Lois?
- Yeah?

377
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:10,935
Look. Everybody's holding hands.
Maybe we should hold hands too, huh?

378
00:38:11,105 --> 00:38:14,199
- Here's my hand, Clark. Hold it.
- Thanks.

379
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:17,602
You know what? They're afraid to let go.

380
00:38:17,778 --> 00:38:20,713
- Why?
- They let go, straight to the lawyer.

381
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:23,748
Oh, I don't know about that.
They look kind of happy to me.

382
00:38:23,918 --> 00:38:26,284
That's because you're blind, Clark.

383
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,313
- Oh, yeah.
- Here.

384
00:38:28,489 --> 00:38:30,320
- No, I've got it. No, l...
- Yeah. Clark.

385
00:38:30,491 --> 00:38:33,585
You've gotta look after yourself.
You've only got one pair of eyes.

386
00:38:33,761 --> 00:38:35,422
- God.
- Lois?

387
00:38:35,596 --> 00:38:36,756
- Now, here.
- Right.

388
00:38:36,931 --> 00:38:39,798
- Don't say I never did anything for you.
- Thank you.

389
00:38:43,504 --> 00:38:44,903
Son! Excuse me, please.

390
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,570
- Be careful.
- What are you doing?

391
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,766
Get down! Get down!

392
00:38:51,445 --> 00:38:54,937
You embarrass me
here in front of everybody.

393
00:38:57,351 --> 00:39:00,809
Lois, did you see what almost
happened there? That little boy...

394
00:39:01,655 --> 00:39:04,681
Hey, I'm hungry. You hungry?

395
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:07,191
- Lois, you're amazing.
- Why, because I'm hungry?

396
00:39:07,361 --> 00:39:11,195
No. Here you are standing in front of one
of nature's most awesome spectacles...

397
00:39:11,365 --> 00:39:14,334
...and you're thinking about
food. Aren't you impressed?

398
00:39:14,502 --> 00:39:17,938
Clark, once a girl's seen
Superman in action...

399
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:20,596
...Niagara Falls kind of
leaves you cold, you know?

400
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,538
Him again, huh?

401
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,044
Oh, I'm sorry.

402
00:39:25,246 --> 00:39:27,510
I have a one-track mind, don't I?

403
00:39:27,681 --> 00:39:30,878
Well, my one-track mind is
telling me that I'm hungry.

404
00:39:31,052 --> 00:39:32,144
- Hot dog?
- Hot dog.

405
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:33,718
Hot dog.

406
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,446
Could I have some orange juice?

407
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,682
- Freshly squeezed.
- Freshly squeezed, I know.

408
00:39:44,999 --> 00:39:46,990
Hey, Mom. Look!

409
00:39:47,168 --> 00:39:49,159
Yeah, honey. That's nice.

410
00:39:52,006 --> 00:39:55,237
Okay, it's two mustard and relish, and...

411
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,670
Oh, my God!

412
00:40:01,782 --> 00:40:03,340
Help!

413
00:40:03,517 --> 00:40:05,280
Help!

414
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,717
Somebody help!

415
00:40:10,124 --> 00:40:11,989
Do something!

416
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:17,519
Good.

417
00:40:18,866 --> 00:40:20,163
Hey, Superman!

418
00:40:21,936 --> 00:40:23,699
Way to go, Superman!

419
00:40:27,108 --> 00:40:28,166
We got a great shot.

420
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:31,334
What a nice man.
Of course he's Jewish.

421
00:40:34,982 --> 00:40:36,472
Incredible.

422
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:46,322
- There you go.
- Again, again!

423
00:40:46,494 --> 00:40:49,725
No, I'm sorry.
Only one ride to a customer.

424
00:40:49,897 --> 00:40:53,856
- Superman. Superman, it's me, it's Lois!
- Bye.

425
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:56,229
Come here. You're gonna get it!

426
00:40:56,403 --> 00:40:59,839
- Give me a heart attack here.
- It's me. It's Lois.

427
00:41:00,007 --> 00:41:02,168
It's Lois Lane.

428
00:41:02,743 --> 00:41:05,303
Well, hello and goodbye.

429
00:41:30,771 --> 00:41:34,070
So this is planet Houston.

430
00:41:36,277 --> 00:41:38,438
A very strange surface.

431
00:42:06,807 --> 00:42:08,536
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, that's all right.

432
00:42:08,709 --> 00:42:11,701
- I just didn't hear you knock, that's all.
- Lois...

433
00:42:11,879 --> 00:42:15,371
...the door wasn't even locked.
Just anybody can walk in here.

434
00:42:15,549 --> 00:42:18,177
- There you go putting yourself down again.
- Very funny.

435
00:42:18,352 --> 00:42:20,445
No, really, I'm serious.

436
00:42:21,555 --> 00:42:23,250
Well, anyway...

437
00:42:23,424 --> 00:42:26,655
...here, a little something for
the newlyweds' dinner tonight.

438
00:42:26,827 --> 00:42:29,489
Pansies. Clark, how...
How different.

439
00:42:29,663 --> 00:42:32,063
Would you believe
they grow wild all around here?

440
00:42:32,233 --> 00:42:34,531
You should see what they
charge for roses at the gift shop.

441
00:42:34,702 --> 00:42:36,465
I'll bet, huh?

442
00:42:38,072 --> 00:42:39,596
- You know something, Lois?
- What?

443
00:42:39,773 --> 00:42:44,267
Well, you know, in spite of
the unreality of all this...

444
00:42:44,445 --> 00:42:47,710
Well, you know, posing as newlyweds
for the sake of a newspaper story.

445
00:42:47,881 --> 00:42:49,940
Well, in spite of myself even...

446
00:42:50,117 --> 00:42:52,847
...I'm kind of starting to
feel like one in a way.

447
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:56,615
- A newlywed, you?
- I don't see why that should be so strange.

448
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:58,417
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

449
00:42:58,592 --> 00:43:01,720
I mean, I'm sure there's
thousands of giris who'd...

450
00:43:02,263 --> 00:43:04,026
Well, a few giris anyway.

451
00:43:04,198 --> 00:43:06,189
- Go ahead and say it.
- Say what?

452
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:11,828
That somehow you're not satisfied
being here with me.

453
00:43:12,873 --> 00:43:17,708
That in some way I don't seem to
shape up very well in your eyes.

454
00:43:17,878 --> 00:43:20,711
I don't have anything to apologize for.
I'm a good reporter.

455
00:43:20,881 --> 00:43:24,942
No, I'm a very good reporter.
And an even better friend to you.

456
00:43:25,953 --> 00:43:27,420
- Stand up.
- Stand up?

457
00:43:27,721 --> 00:43:29,188
Yeah, stand up, just for fun.

458
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:35,321
Now, come here. Look at yourself.
Just look at yourself.

459
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:40,494
What we have here is
a potentially aggressive, dynamite guy...

460
00:43:40,668 --> 00:43:42,295
...who can do anything he wants.

461
00:43:42,469 --> 00:43:45,131
I mean, it's not my fault
you keep putting yourself down.

462
00:43:45,306 --> 00:43:47,331
- Oh, yeah? How?
- Well, for starters...

463
00:43:47,508 --> 00:43:49,976
...you slouch all the time.
Here, stand up straight.

464
00:43:50,144 --> 00:43:51,736
There, that's better.

465
00:43:51,912 --> 00:43:55,370
And get yourself a jacket with a vent
and shoes that don't lace up...

466
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:59,349
...and a shirt with a little color
or a pattern or something.

467
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,114
And a bow tie that doesn't look
like a letter opener.

468
00:44:02,289 --> 00:44:04,553
All right, Lois. All right.

469
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:08,161
- We've been through this, haven't we?
- Yes.

470
00:44:08,962 --> 00:44:11,897
I know where this is all leading to.

471
00:44:13,334 --> 00:44:16,098
And I'm sorry. I mean, I'm sorry...

472
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:19,137
...but no matter how hard I try, I just...

473
00:44:19,306 --> 00:44:21,866
Just... Just never will be him.

474
00:44:22,042 --> 00:44:23,407
Him who?

475
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:27,104
"Him who"? Him Superman.

476
00:44:27,281 --> 00:44:30,478
Now, I can't help the fact that
you seem to think that you love him.

477
00:44:30,651 --> 00:44:34,314
That's something I'll have to live with.
But darn it, Lois, that's enough now.

478
00:44:35,456 --> 00:44:38,016
Maybe I just can't stand
the competition anymore.

479
00:44:38,192 --> 00:44:41,525
And just maybe you've been
the competition all along.

480
00:44:41,695 --> 00:44:44,095
Lois, I've never been
particularly good at riddles.

481
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:46,528
Let me make this one really easy for you.

482
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:50,703
Why, with thousands of children
potentially falling off something lethal...

483
00:44:50,871 --> 00:44:54,739
...all around the worid, would Superman
be in Niagara Falls today?

484
00:44:54,908 --> 00:44:56,307
Why not the Grand Canyon?

485
00:44:56,477 --> 00:45:00,311
- Ask the child's family. I'm sure they know.
- Why is it always when I'm with you...

486
00:45:00,481 --> 00:45:03,939
...until Superman appears?
And then you seem to disappear.

487
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:07,849
- Very conveniently, it seems to me.
- I was out for hot dogs. For Pete's sake...

488
00:45:08,021 --> 00:45:10,717
When Superman appeared,
I looked at that hot dog stand...

489
00:45:10,891 --> 00:45:12,119
...and you were gone.

490
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:13,486
- I was...
- Nowhere.

491
00:45:15,062 --> 00:45:16,996
I can't help it if I had to go to the...

492
00:45:17,831 --> 00:45:20,061
You are Superman, aren't you?

493
00:45:20,234 --> 00:45:23,726
Lois, look, we've been through
these hallucinations of yours before.

494
00:45:23,904 --> 00:45:25,701
Can't you see what you almost did?

495
00:45:25,873 --> 00:45:28,137
Throwing yourself off a building
30 stories high?

496
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:30,538
Can't you see the tragic mistake
you almost made?

497
00:45:30,711 --> 00:45:34,647
Yeah, I made a mistake.
I made a mistake because...

498
00:45:36,517 --> 00:45:38,508
...I risked my life instead of yours.

499
00:45:38,685 --> 00:45:40,744
Lois, don't be insane.

500
00:45:40,921 --> 00:45:44,118
And don't fall down because
you're just gonna have to get up again.

501
00:45:44,291 --> 00:45:46,350
Lois, now, don't be crazy now. Lois!

502
00:45:59,239 --> 00:46:00,433
It is you.

503
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,706
I guess I've known this
for the longest time.

504
00:46:12,586 --> 00:46:14,383
You realize, of course...

505
00:46:14,555 --> 00:46:17,547
...if you'd been wrong,
Clark Kent would have been killed.

506
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,688
With a blank?

507
00:46:25,065 --> 00:46:26,259
Gotcha.

508
00:46:50,591 --> 00:46:53,287
A primitive sort of life form.

509
00:47:02,436 --> 00:47:03,664
Did you see that?

510
00:47:04,972 --> 00:47:07,167
Did you see what I did?

511
00:47:07,341 --> 00:47:09,901
I have powers beyond reason here.

512
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:12,041
We all have them, my dear.

513
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:57,582
- Wow, this is your home?
- No.

514
00:47:57,758 --> 00:48:00,818
Actually, I live in the city,
about three blocks from you.

515
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,628
No, this is a very special place for me.

516
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:07,096
I wanted you to see it.

517
00:48:07,501 --> 00:48:09,696
Listen, you warm enough?

518
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:13,030
I guess I should be freezing, but I'm not.

519
00:48:13,206 --> 00:48:14,833
Good.

520
00:48:15,008 --> 00:48:17,169
Come on, let me show you.

521
00:48:36,129 --> 00:48:37,323
I don't know.

522
00:48:38,265 --> 00:48:41,462
From the look of them,
I'll bet $ 10 they're from Los Ángeles.

523
00:48:50,811 --> 00:48:54,679
Hey, you hippies,
get your butts off the road!

524
00:48:55,048 --> 00:48:58,142
I like the globe. It flashes
red like our Krypton sun.

525
00:48:58,552 --> 00:49:00,747
But not this irritating noise.

526
00:49:01,421 --> 00:49:03,252
Make way.

527
00:49:04,124 --> 00:49:05,887
Did I hear right?

528
00:49:06,059 --> 00:49:07,856
That son of a bitch give me an order?

529
00:49:08,395 --> 00:49:10,386
Duane, you take care of it.

530
00:49:15,435 --> 00:49:18,199
Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing here?

531
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:20,397
What is this symbol?

532
00:49:20,574 --> 00:49:22,371
Do you follow another leader?

533
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:24,874
Follow the leader?

534
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,412
Holy skunk sweat.

535
00:49:28,582 --> 00:49:30,777
- All right.
- A weapon of some sort.

536
00:49:40,627 --> 00:49:42,356
How the hell did you do that?

537
00:49:50,003 --> 00:49:51,436
Jesus H. Christ.

538
00:49:53,974 --> 00:49:57,375
- That was good.
- I thought we might...

539
00:49:58,845 --> 00:50:01,439
...abandon the orange juice for once.

540
00:50:08,822 --> 00:50:11,484
- Here, cheers.
- Cheers.

541
00:50:15,796 --> 00:50:18,890
Must be tough being Clark Kent, isn't it?

542
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,996
No. No, I really...

543
00:50:22,169 --> 00:50:24,330
I really like it sometimes.

544
00:50:24,504 --> 00:50:26,665
Even though I do
make a fool of myself.

545
00:50:28,375 --> 00:50:32,812
But, you know, if it weren't for him,
I never would have met you.

546
00:50:34,715 --> 00:50:38,151
But he is you.

547
00:50:38,919 --> 00:50:42,252
- It's kind of confusing.
- Not to me, it isn't.

548
00:50:44,691 --> 00:50:46,124
Everything's clear.

549
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:54,563
Until yesterday, a middle-American town
that Middle America had forgotten.

550
00:50:54,735 --> 00:50:59,138
But today, the population...
Exaggerated reports put it at 123.

551
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:00,739
- Has increased by three.

552
00:51:00,907 --> 00:51:03,933
And these three new arrivals
bring destruction in their wake.

553
00:51:04,111 --> 00:51:06,807
As I look west into
East Houston this morning...

554
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:10,177
<i>...I see a town gripped with fear.
- Who's the guy?</i>

555
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:12,318
<i>Get that guy. Follow the guy.</i>

556
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,113
<i>Who's the big guy?</i>

557
00:51:14,921 --> 00:51:16,821
<i>Okay, yeah, we've got a...</i>

558
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:18,852
<i>- You got that?
- No.</i>

559
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:24,960
<i>- That's fine.
- Try to wiggle it.</i>

560
00:51:25,132 --> 00:51:27,066
Who else is seeing this?

561
00:51:27,234 --> 00:51:31,102
Well, with this satellite linkup,
just about everybody. The whole planet.

562
00:51:31,271 --> 00:51:33,466
The whole planet Houston?

563
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:37,007
Earth. The whole planet Earth.

564
00:51:39,312 --> 00:51:41,371
You may continue.

565
00:51:41,548 --> 00:51:45,211
As the extraordinary story continues...

566
00:51:46,253 --> 00:51:48,278
- Enough of this man.
- As this extraordinary...

567
00:51:48,455 --> 00:51:51,891
If the whole planet is watching,
let's show them something interesting.

568
00:51:52,058 --> 00:51:54,788
<i>Throw down your arms and surrender!</i>

569
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,830
<i>This is an order.</i>

570
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:03,427
General Zod does not
take orders. He gives them.

571
00:52:25,826 --> 00:52:28,818
He was in the line of that fire
and nothing happened to him.

572
00:52:28,995 --> 00:52:31,259
I haven't seen the likes
of this since Superman.

573
00:52:32,165 --> 00:52:33,894
<i>Yes? Yes.</i>

574
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:38,800
<i>The Newsbeat control room has informed
me that a fleet of helicopter gunships is...</i>

575
00:52:38,972 --> 00:52:42,499
- Mr. President, sir, can't we...?
- There's nothing anybody can do.

576
00:52:42,676 --> 00:52:44,974
They have such powers,
nothing can stop them.

577
00:52:45,145 --> 00:52:46,578
Where's Superman?

578
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:49,806
Where is he?
Why doesn't he do something?

579
00:53:02,229 --> 00:53:03,423
<i>Fire again.</i>

580
00:53:05,732 --> 00:53:07,199
<i>Fire again.</i>

581
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:13,895
Look. They need machines to fly.

582
00:53:14,708 --> 00:53:17,370
<i>- Banking now.
- What bravery.</i>

583
00:53:17,711 --> 00:53:21,670
Be nice to them, my dear.
Blow them a kiss.

584
00:53:24,584 --> 00:53:27,280
<i>Rockets ready. Coming in on target.
Wait, wait.</i>

585
00:53:29,422 --> 00:53:30,616
<i>We're out of control.</i>

586
00:53:32,726 --> 00:53:36,025
<i>We're coming in, coming down.
Can't control it!</i>

587
00:53:36,196 --> 00:53:37,458
<i>We're coming down.</i>

588
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,370
I win.

589
00:53:46,773 --> 00:53:48,866
I always win.

590
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:53,343
Is there no one on
this planet to even challenge me?

591
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:14,800
Come forward.

592
00:54:15,135 --> 00:54:17,035
Your general wishes to speak.

593
00:54:17,304 --> 00:54:21,536
I am General Zod, your ruler.

594
00:54:22,876 --> 00:54:26,903
Yes, today begins a new order!

595
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,648
Your lands, your possessions...

596
00:54:29,816 --> 00:54:34,776
...your very lives will gladly be
given in tribute to me.

597
00:54:35,322 --> 00:54:37,483
In return for your obedience...

598
00:54:37,657 --> 00:54:40,319
...you will enjoy my generous protection.

599
00:54:40,493 --> 00:54:44,361
In other words,
you will be allowed to live.

600
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:49,858
So you are a general?

601
00:54:50,904 --> 00:54:53,065
And who is your superior?

602
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:58,971
- I answer only to the president.
- And he will answer to me.

603
00:55:00,246 --> 00:55:04,046
Or all of his cities
will end up like this one.

604
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:13,685
Thousands of hours to create,
and they defaced it in seconds.

605
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:16,988
Imagine what they'll do
to the worid if we resist.

606
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:24,233
<i>The people of your planet
are well-pleased with you, Kal-EI.</i>

607
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:28,135
<i>You have served them faithfully,
and they are grateful for it.</i>

608
00:55:30,043 --> 00:55:35,071
<i>And yet you have returned
to reason with me once again.</i>

609
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:40,519
<i>My son, I have tried to anticipate
your every question.</i>

610
00:55:40,687 --> 00:55:42,518
<i>This was one I'd...</i>

611
00:55:43,957 --> 00:55:45,891
<i>I'd hoped you would not ask.</i>

612
00:55:49,062 --> 00:55:51,030
My attachment...

613
00:55:53,066 --> 00:55:58,368
...the feelings which I have developed
for a certain human being...

614
00:55:58,671 --> 00:56:01,003
...have deeply affected me, Father.

615
00:56:01,174 --> 00:56:05,634
<i>You cannot serve humanity by investing
your time and emotion in one human being...</i>

616
00:56:05,812 --> 00:56:07,939
<i>... at the expense of the rest.</i>

617
00:56:08,148 --> 00:56:12,949
<i>- The concepts are mutally exclusive.
- And...</i>

618
00:56:14,754 --> 00:56:18,952
...if I no longer wish
to serve humanity...

619
00:56:19,893 --> 00:56:23,329
<i>Is this how you repay their gratitude?</i>

620
00:56:23,496 --> 00:56:27,296
<i>By abandoning the weak,
the defenseless, the needy...</i>

621
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:30,095
<i>... for the sake of your selfish pursuits?</i>

622
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:33,739
Selfish? After all I've done for them?

623
00:56:33,907 --> 00:56:36,501
Will there ever come a time
when I've served enough?

624
00:56:36,676 --> 00:56:39,236
At least they get a chance for happiness.

625
00:56:39,412 --> 00:56:42,040
I only ask as much, no more.

626
00:56:42,782 --> 00:56:45,478
<i>Yours is a higher happiness.</i>

627
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:50,021
<i>The fulfillment of your missión,
an inspiration you must have felt.</i>

628
00:56:50,623 --> 00:56:53,558
<i>You must have felt
that happiness within you.</i>

629
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:56,988
<i>My son, surely you cannot
deny that feeling.</i>

630
00:56:57,363 --> 00:57:00,696
No, I cannot...

631
00:57:01,401 --> 00:57:05,235
...any more than I can deny the other,
which is stronger in me, Father.

632
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:07,901
So much stronger.

633
00:57:13,913 --> 00:57:16,040
Is there no way then, Father?

634
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:20,642
Must I finally be denied
the one thing in life which I truly desire?

635
00:57:22,322 --> 00:57:25,120
<i>If you will not be Kal-EI...</i>

636
00:57:25,492 --> 00:57:27,426
<i>... if you will live as one of them...</i>

637
00:57:27,994 --> 00:57:29,985
<i>... love their kind as one of them...</i>

638
00:57:30,563 --> 00:57:32,758
<i>... then it follows that you must...</i>

639
00:57:33,466 --> 00:57:35,559
<i>... become one of them.</i>

640
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:09,899
<i>This crystal chamber has in it the
harnessed rays of the red sun of Krypton.</i>

641
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:11,802
<i>Once exposed to them...</i>

642
00:58:11,971 --> 00:58:15,498
<i>... all your great powers
on Earth will disappear.</i>

643
00:58:16,442 --> 00:58:17,932
<i>Forever.</i>

644
00:58:18,611 --> 00:58:20,636
<i>Once this is done, there's no going back.</i>

645
00:58:22,115 --> 00:58:24,515
<i>You will feel like an ordinary man.</i>

646
00:58:25,552 --> 00:58:28,612
<i>And you can be harmed
like an ordinary man.</i>

647
00:58:30,823 --> 00:58:32,688
<i>Think, Kal-EI.</i>

648
00:58:34,127 --> 00:58:35,788
<i>I beg you.</i>

649
00:58:36,863 --> 00:58:38,490
Father...

650
00:58:39,732 --> 00:58:40,960
...I love her.

651
00:58:59,018 --> 00:59:00,508
<i>Think, Kal-EI.</i>

652
01:00:57,337 --> 01:00:58,998
Come on. Come on.

653
01:01:09,882 --> 01:01:11,076
Look out!

654
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:04,201
You are the one they call president?

655
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:06,598
I am.

656
01:02:08,674 --> 01:02:12,542
I see you are practiced
in worshipping things that fly.

657
01:02:13,913 --> 01:02:15,608
Good.

658
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:18,643
Rise before Zod.

659
01:02:22,622 --> 01:02:25,591
Now, kneel before Zod.

660
01:02:39,806 --> 01:02:41,330
You are not the president.

661
01:02:41,641 --> 01:02:46,408
No one who leads so many
could possibly kneel so quickly.

662
01:02:46,579 --> 01:02:48,376
I am the man they are protecting.

663
01:02:49,715 --> 01:02:51,580
I am the president.

664
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:54,748
I'll kneel before you
if it will save lives.

665
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:56,917
It will.

666
01:02:57,089 --> 01:02:59,649
Starting with your own.

667
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:06,559
What a backward planet this must be...

668
01:03:06,999 --> 01:03:09,832
...where the men wear the ribbons...

669
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:11,996
...and the jewelry.

670
01:03:25,451 --> 01:03:27,351
What I do now...

671
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:30,717
...I do for the sake of
the people of the worid.

672
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:34,883
But there is one man here on Earth
who will never kneel before you.

673
01:03:35,194 --> 01:03:38,459
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?

674
01:03:38,631 --> 01:03:40,622
I wish I knew.

675
01:03:44,971 --> 01:03:46,336
Oh, God.

676
01:03:46,839 --> 01:03:48,363
Zod.

677
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:52,443
Hey.

678
01:03:52,612 --> 01:03:55,137
You're awfully quiet over there.

679
01:03:56,849 --> 01:04:00,148
Yeah, I was just thinking...

680
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:03,846
...I can't believe what
you've given up for me.

681
01:04:04,657 --> 01:04:08,184
Are you kidding? I didn't do
it for you, Lois, I did it for us.

682
01:04:08,794 --> 01:04:11,854
See, I told you there'd be
a hot dog place somewhere.

683
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:15,967
Okay. It sure takes longer
when you can't fly.

684
01:04:16,135 --> 01:04:17,864
Hurry up.

685
01:04:18,037 --> 01:04:19,937
- Come on.
- Okay.

686
01:04:23,142 --> 01:04:25,474
Come on, it's my treat. Come on.

687
01:04:29,215 --> 01:04:31,581
Oh, boy, it's Mr. Wonderful.

688
01:04:33,219 --> 01:04:35,483
Thank you.

689
01:04:37,723 --> 01:04:40,453
- Do you have a men's room?
- Yeah. Right in the corner.

690
01:04:40,626 --> 01:04:43,151
- Want to sit down?
- Yeah.

691
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:46,621
Hi, what would you folks like?

692
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:50,394
I'd like a cheeseburger with
everything on it, and a Coke...

693
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:54,233
...an order of fries
and a side salad, please.

694
01:04:55,274 --> 01:04:58,266
- And for you, sir?
- I'll think about it when I get back.

695
01:04:58,444 --> 01:04:59,968
Right. That's one cheeseburger...

696
01:05:00,212 --> 01:05:02,874
- Steak and eggs, over easy, coffee.
- Can I have my Coke?

697
01:05:03,049 --> 01:05:04,812
Coming right up.

698
01:05:05,184 --> 01:05:08,676
- I'm sorry, that seat's taken.
- It is now, sweetheart.

699
01:05:09,822 --> 01:05:11,790
Can I buy you something to eat?

700
01:05:12,458 --> 01:05:14,153
No, thank you.

701
01:05:15,061 --> 01:05:17,359
Excuse me. I think
you're sitting in my seat.

702
01:05:18,197 --> 01:05:20,688
Your seat's in there, four-eyes.

703
01:05:23,703 --> 01:05:27,571
Gee, I think perhaps somebody
ought to teach you some manners, sir.

704
01:05:28,708 --> 01:05:31,199
Yeah? Well, let me
know when he comes in.

705
01:05:31,377 --> 01:05:33,868
- Look, Clark, we can just...
- Honey.

706
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:37,581
Excuse me, sir, would
you care to step outside?

707
01:05:37,783 --> 01:05:40,513
I said, excuse me, sir,
would you care to step outside?

708
01:05:43,789 --> 01:05:46,519
Now, listen, Rocky,
your steak's coming right up.

709
01:05:47,093 --> 01:05:50,859
Keep it on the flame, Ron.
This is just a minute steak.

710
01:05:52,098 --> 01:05:53,656
After you.

711
01:05:54,333 --> 01:05:56,198
- Clark.
- It's all right, honey.

712
01:05:59,505 --> 01:06:00,597
Clark!

713
01:06:02,808 --> 01:06:04,241
You all right, fella?

714
01:06:04,410 --> 01:06:07,174
He's gonna be fine,
just give me that.

715
01:06:07,513 --> 01:06:11,040
- Clark?
- Blood. It's my blood.

716
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:16,082
I think maybe we ought to
hire a bodyguard from now on.

717
01:06:16,255 --> 01:06:19,713
I don't want a bodyguard.
I want the man I fell in love with.

718
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:22,019
I know that, Lois.

719
01:06:22,194 --> 01:06:24,424
I wish he were here.

720
01:06:30,102 --> 01:06:31,831
Clark.

721
01:06:33,205 --> 01:06:36,436
Boy, you just don't have
enough sense to stay down, do you?

722
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:47,614
You... You... You are no good.

723
01:06:48,354 --> 01:06:50,549
Settle down!

724
01:06:51,123 --> 01:06:53,557
I don't like your meat anyway.

725
01:06:55,728 --> 01:06:57,593
Oh, God.

726
01:07:04,670 --> 01:07:07,639
Clark? Clark?

727
01:07:07,807 --> 01:07:09,604
Clark, can you get up?

728
01:07:09,809 --> 01:07:12,471
- All right. Come on. I got you.
- Go slow. Go slow.

729
01:07:12,678 --> 01:07:14,441
Try and get up in that chair.

730
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:18,944
- Sit down.
- I'm all right. I'm all right.

731
01:07:20,386 --> 01:07:23,981
Okay, everybody, he's all right.
Just relax. We'll have some fresh coffee.

732
01:07:24,156 --> 01:07:26,454
I'll turn the box on.

733
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:30,126
<i>We interrupt this program
for an urgent message...</i>

734
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:33,197
<i>... from the President
of the United States.</i>

735
01:07:33,432 --> 01:07:35,764
<i>This is your president.</i>

736
01:07:36,035 --> 01:07:40,870
<i>On behalf of my country, and in the
name of the other leaders of the worid...</i>

737
01:07:41,373 --> 01:07:44,103
<i>... with whom I have today consulted...</i>

738
01:07:44,643 --> 01:07:47,407
<i>... I hereby abdicate...</i>

739
01:07:47,646 --> 01:07:51,912
<i>... all authority and
control over this planet...</i>

740
01:07:52,451 --> 01:07:53,975
<i>... to General Zod.</i>

741
01:07:54,787 --> 01:07:55,981
Zod.

742
01:07:56,155 --> 01:07:59,682
<i>Only by strict compliance
with all his directions...</i>

743
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:04,452
<i>... will the lives of
innocent millions be spared.</i>

744
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:06,589
<i>Superman, can you hear me?</i>

745
01:08:06,766 --> 01:08:10,532
<i>- Superman, where...?
- Who is this Superman?</i>

746
01:08:10,703 --> 01:08:16,767
<i>- You'll find out. And when you do...
- Come to me, Superman, if you dare.</i>

747
01:08:16,942 --> 01:08:18,534
<i>I defy you.</i>

748
01:08:18,711 --> 01:08:22,169
<i>Come! Come and kneel before Zod.</i>

749
01:08:24,617 --> 01:08:26,050
<i>Zod!</i>

750
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:29,383
- Here? When?
- When?

751
01:08:29,555 --> 01:08:33,321
Where the hell have you been, Mac?
On a desert island?

752
01:08:36,061 --> 01:08:37,790
I have to go back.

753
01:08:37,963 --> 01:08:39,931
You can't go back.

754
01:08:40,099 --> 01:08:42,624
- There's no way now.
- I have to.

755
01:08:42,802 --> 01:08:45,999
I've gotta try, damn it. I've
gotta try something, anything.

756
01:08:46,172 --> 01:08:49,039
It's not your fault.

757
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:52,609
You didn't know this was gonna happen.

758
01:08:54,013 --> 01:08:55,844
He knew.

759
01:08:56,015 --> 01:08:58,279
I heard him.

760
01:08:58,450 --> 01:09:00,714
I just didn't listen.

761
01:09:17,369 --> 01:09:19,963
You're master of all you survey.

762
01:09:20,172 --> 01:09:22,106
And so I was yesterday.

763
01:09:22,274 --> 01:09:24,765
And the day before.

764
01:09:38,724 --> 01:09:39,918
Hello, there.

765
01:09:41,493 --> 01:09:43,393
Lex Luthor.

766
01:09:45,798 --> 01:09:47,925
Lex Luthor.

767
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:51,301
You've heard the name?
The greatest criminal mind on Earth.

768
01:09:51,837 --> 01:09:54,465
I told you this was a puny planet.

769
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,267
Wait just a moment.

770
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:59,570
Wait until you get to know
me better. Will you, please?

771
01:09:59,745 --> 01:10:03,442
Wait. Look, I can give
you anything you want.

772
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:05,607
I can give you the brass ring...

773
01:10:05,784 --> 01:10:10,517
...the unlimited freedom
to maim, kill, destroy.

774
01:10:11,023 --> 01:10:15,619
Plus, Lex Luthor's keen mind.
Lex Luthor's savvy.

775
01:10:15,794 --> 01:10:20,128
Lex Luthor's career guidance.
Lex Luthor's School of Better...

776
01:10:22,034 --> 01:10:24,502
We have all of this without you.

777
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:27,465
You cannot bargain
with what you don't have.

778
01:10:28,173 --> 01:10:30,334
Magnificent One...

779
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:34,711
...what I am bargaining with
is what you do not have.

780
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,245
The son of Jor-EI.

781
01:10:40,052 --> 01:10:42,350
The son of Jor-EI?

782
01:10:42,721 --> 01:10:44,211
I said that, didn't I?

783
01:10:44,723 --> 01:10:47,385
Jor-EI, our jailer?

784
01:10:47,626 --> 01:10:49,787
No, Jor-EI, the baseball player.

785
01:10:49,962 --> 01:10:51,953
Yes, Jor-EI, your jailer.

786
01:10:52,264 --> 01:10:55,756
- The son of Jor-EI? On this planet?
- Aye.

787
01:10:55,935 --> 01:10:58,529
<i>Possibly you know him better
by his nom de voyage...</i>

788
01:10:58,704 --> 01:11:01,798
...or his name he travels under:

789
01:11:01,974 --> 01:11:03,771
Superman.

790
01:11:06,078 --> 01:11:07,739
So this is Superman.

791
01:11:09,081 --> 01:11:10,378
How do you know of Jor-EI?

792
01:11:10,549 --> 01:11:14,986
My Fullness, as I
explained to you before...

793
01:11:16,055 --> 01:11:17,545
...I'm about the best there is.

794
01:11:17,723 --> 01:11:19,020
Revenge.

795
01:11:19,191 --> 01:11:21,182
We will kill the son of our jailer.

796
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,329
- Revenge.
- Revenge! Now we're cooking.

797
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:26,521
- He flies, then?
- Constantly.

798
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:28,724
- He has powers as we do?
- Certainly.

799
01:11:28,901 --> 01:11:33,235
But, Magnificent One...

800
01:11:33,405 --> 01:11:36,238
...he's just one...

801
01:11:36,408 --> 01:11:38,968
...where you are three.

802
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:43,113
- Or four, if you count him twice.
- We will bring him to his knees.

803
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:45,043
Wait!

804
01:11:46,618 --> 01:11:47,880
First, you must find him.

805
01:11:48,187 --> 01:11:51,486
And Lex Baby is the only
one who knows where he is.

806
01:11:53,025 --> 01:11:55,516
What do you want?

807
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:57,855
Well, general...

808
01:11:58,030 --> 01:12:00,590
...the worid is a big place.

809
01:12:00,766 --> 01:12:03,200
Thank goodness...

810
01:12:03,369 --> 01:12:05,337
...my needs are small.

811
01:12:06,772 --> 01:12:12,608
As it turns out, I have this
affinity for beachfront property.

812
01:12:14,346 --> 01:12:16,837
What do you want?

813
01:12:17,016 --> 01:12:18,779
Australia.

814
01:12:50,315 --> 01:12:51,839
Hey.

815
01:12:54,586 --> 01:12:59,046
Listen... Hey, come on,
where are you...? Please!

816
01:13:36,628 --> 01:13:38,220
Father?

817
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,892
If you can hear me...

818
01:13:44,603 --> 01:13:46,503
...I failed.

819
01:13:48,907 --> 01:13:50,807
I failed you...

820
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:52,873
...I failed myself...

821
01:13:54,746 --> 01:13:56,839
...and all humanity.

822
01:13:59,751 --> 01:14:01,912
I've traded my birthright...

823
01:14:03,021 --> 01:14:07,822
...for a life of submissión in a worid
that's now ruled by your enemies.

824
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:12,019
There's nobody left to help them now...

825
01:14:12,831 --> 01:14:14,765
...the people of the worid.

826
01:14:15,834 --> 01:14:17,859
Not since I...

827
01:14:18,770 --> 01:14:21,898
Father!

828
01:15:32,961 --> 01:15:37,557
<i>Listen carefully, my son,
for we shall never speak again.</i>

829
01:15:39,434 --> 01:15:42,028
<i>If you hear me now...</i>

830
01:15:42,203 --> 01:15:45,229
<i>... then you have made use
of the only means left to you:</i>

831
01:15:46,141 --> 01:15:50,077
<i>The crystal source through which
our communications begun.</i>

832
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:53,446
<i>The circle is now complete.</i>

833
01:15:53,815 --> 01:15:57,012
<i>You have made a dreadful mistake, Kal-EI.</i>

834
01:16:00,422 --> 01:16:03,949
<i>You did this of your own free will...</i>

835
01:16:04,492 --> 01:16:07,290
<i>... in spite of all I could say
to dissuade you.</i>

836
01:16:09,597 --> 01:16:11,189
I...

837
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:15,860
<i>Now you have returned to me
for one last chance to redeem yourself.</i>

838
01:16:16,037 --> 01:16:20,940
<i>This too finally I have anticipated,
my son.</i>

839
01:16:23,611 --> 01:16:25,772
<i>Look at me, Kal-EI.</i>

840
01:16:28,216 --> 01:16:32,812
<i>Once before when you were small,
I died...</i>

841
01:16:34,055 --> 01:16:37,024
<i>... while giving you a chance for life.</i>

842
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:42,118
<i>And now, even though it will exhaust
the final energy left within me...</i>

843
01:16:42,831 --> 01:16:44,662
Father, no.

844
01:16:46,167 --> 01:16:48,635
<i>Look at me, Kal-EI.</i>

845
01:16:51,373 --> 01:16:56,174
<i>The Kryptonian prophecy
will be at last fulfilled.</i>

846
01:16:56,478 --> 01:17:02,007
<i>The son becomes the father,
the father becomes the son.</i>

847
01:17:06,521 --> 01:17:10,423
<i>Farewell forever, Kal-EI.</i>

848
01:17:13,695 --> 01:17:16,163
<i>Remember me, my son.</i>

849
01:17:46,194 --> 01:17:47,786
My son.

850
01:18:03,378 --> 01:18:05,073
Father!

851
01:18:18,726 --> 01:18:22,184
Harold. Coffee, black, no sugar.

852
01:18:22,363 --> 01:18:25,457
Black, no sug... Yeah. Yeah.

853
01:18:26,334 --> 01:18:27,892
Who's paying, huh?

854
01:18:28,937 --> 01:18:31,667
No, no! There's three of them.
That cockamamie general...

855
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:35,970
...and a big truck with hair on it and a broad
that looks like the queen of the runway.

856
01:18:36,144 --> 01:18:40,877
They can fly, they can see through things.
Anything Superman can do, they can do.

857
01:18:41,349 --> 01:18:43,647
Where is he, anyway?

858
01:18:43,852 --> 01:18:45,843
Maybe he hasn't heard
about it yet, chief.

859
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:48,181
- Maybe...
- Maybe he's just run out of guts.

860
01:18:48,356 --> 01:18:50,984
- No sugar. And don't call me "chief."
- He'll be here.

861
01:18:51,159 --> 01:18:54,686
- Lf there's any way at all, he'll be here.
- Yeah, he'll be here.

862
01:18:57,232 --> 01:18:59,496
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

863
01:19:00,201 --> 01:19:02,101
- Hey, Charlie, you feel that?
- Yeah.

864
01:19:02,403 --> 01:19:03,802
Sounds like an earthquake.

865
01:19:05,907 --> 01:19:07,465
Oh, my!

866
01:19:13,581 --> 01:19:16,243
- It's those three.
- Stop!

867
01:19:16,417 --> 01:19:19,716
- Oh, my God, they're here now!
- Oh, no!

868
01:19:31,299 --> 01:19:32,527
This is scary!

869
01:20:21,616 --> 01:20:23,743
You all right, chief?

870
01:20:24,252 --> 01:20:25,651
Hi.

871
01:20:27,589 --> 01:20:30,490
You should see the White House.
They'll be cleaning for months.

872
01:20:30,658 --> 01:20:31,989
Lex Luthor.

873
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:33,788
Wouldn't you know it?

874
01:20:34,429 --> 01:20:37,262
This is the son of Jor-EI?

875
01:20:37,432 --> 01:20:39,332
- No, but I bet you're a son of a...
- Jimmy!

876
01:20:40,568 --> 01:20:43,560
You promised me the son of Jor-EI.

877
01:20:45,039 --> 01:20:46,199
Yes, Your Grace.

878
01:20:46,808 --> 01:20:50,403
But what I've given
you is the next best thing.

879
01:20:50,578 --> 01:20:53,604
You just hold on to that
little lady, and he'll be along.

880
01:20:53,781 --> 01:20:55,339
See, they have this relationship.

881
01:20:55,516 --> 01:20:59,850
She does all his public relations,
and he gives her every exclusive.

882
01:21:00,021 --> 01:21:02,683
They're the best of friends.
You know what I mean?

883
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:06,255
What an undemanding
male this Superman must be.

884
01:21:06,694 --> 01:21:09,322
You could use a tuck
here and there yourself, sister.

885
01:21:09,831 --> 01:21:11,423
Wait!

886
01:21:11,599 --> 01:21:12,964
- I'm sorry!
- She lives for now.

887
01:21:13,901 --> 01:21:16,267
Kill the rest, starting with him.

888
01:21:18,806 --> 01:21:21,297
Wait. Wait, wait, wait!

889
01:21:21,476 --> 01:21:23,034
Wait. Wait.

890
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:27,307
Don't you remember the White House?
The Oval Room? We had a few laughs there.

891
01:21:27,882 --> 01:21:29,440
You ought to have that fixed.

892
01:21:41,029 --> 01:21:42,223
General...

893
01:21:43,131 --> 01:21:45,258
...haven't you heard
of freedom of the press?

894
01:21:45,466 --> 01:21:47,491
- Superman!
- Superman, thank God.

895
01:21:48,469 --> 01:21:49,834
I mean, get him!

896
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:52,069
Come to me, son of Jor-EI!

897
01:21:52,573 --> 01:21:55,406
Kneel before Zod!

898
01:22:10,024 --> 01:22:12,015
Watch out. You all right?

899
01:22:31,612 --> 01:22:33,170
Son of Jor-EI.

900
01:22:33,648 --> 01:22:36,208
We were beginning to
think you were a coward.

901
01:22:36,584 --> 01:22:37,846
I'm not a coward, Zod.

902
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:41,179
It is extremely likely
you are merely a fool.

903
01:22:41,356 --> 01:22:43,722
Like father, like son.

904
01:23:00,007 --> 01:23:01,406
Look out!

905
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:07,243
Then die as you deserve to!

906
01:23:17,392 --> 01:23:19,587
Come on, come on, Superman! Get him!

907
01:23:19,861 --> 01:23:21,920
Man, this is gonna be good.

908
01:23:57,932 --> 01:23:59,524
<i>Superman.</i>

909
01:24:20,555 --> 01:24:22,921
- Hey, that's the chief's.
- The chief's got it.

910
01:24:31,632 --> 01:24:33,600
What, you hit a woman?

911
01:24:56,724 --> 01:24:59,887
Oh, my God! My baby!

912
01:25:00,261 --> 01:25:02,695
Help my baby!

913
01:25:05,566 --> 01:25:07,261
Thank you.

914
01:25:08,836 --> 01:25:12,397
This Superman is nothing of the kind.

915
01:25:12,607 --> 01:25:15,007
- I've discovered his weakness.
- Yes.

916
01:25:15,176 --> 01:25:16,575
He cares.

917
01:25:16,844 --> 01:25:20,109
He actually cares
for these Earth people.

918
01:25:20,281 --> 01:25:23,444
- Like pets?
- I suppose so.

919
01:25:31,626 --> 01:25:33,526
I'll draw his fire...

920
01:25:33,694 --> 01:25:35,628
...with some of my own.

921
01:26:03,190 --> 01:26:04,851
What's happening to those cars?

922
01:26:08,296 --> 01:26:09,763
Get out of the way!

923
01:27:24,939 --> 01:27:26,031
Superman.

924
01:28:11,585 --> 01:28:12,984
Oh, thank you!

925
01:28:13,154 --> 01:28:15,714
I never thought this thing
would go the distance.

926
01:28:29,937 --> 01:28:32,030
No! Don't do it!

927
01:28:32,473 --> 01:28:34,134
The people!

928
01:28:38,779 --> 01:28:40,576
Throw it!

929
01:29:01,802 --> 01:29:05,101
- Get away from there. Get away from there.
- Let's help them out!

930
01:29:08,642 --> 01:29:12,100
- I got her. I got her. Don't worry.
- He's dead.

931
01:29:13,748 --> 01:29:15,739
Superman is dead.

932
01:29:18,986 --> 01:29:20,248
They've killed Superman.

933
01:29:21,689 --> 01:29:23,987
- He's dead.
- Let's go get them!

934
01:29:24,158 --> 01:29:26,752
- Come on, we'll show them!
- I know some judo. Let's go!

935
01:29:27,294 --> 01:29:28,818
Come on!

936
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:01,888
I'm holding it, I'm holding it!

937
01:30:02,062 --> 01:30:04,462
What can you do if
you can't see what's happening?

938
01:30:09,436 --> 01:30:12,564
- Hold on!
- Oh, my God!

939
01:31:21,475 --> 01:31:23,943
You can't leave us!

940
01:31:28,649 --> 01:31:32,949
So he is a coward after all.

941
01:31:33,354 --> 01:31:34,878
He's gone.

942
01:31:35,055 --> 01:31:36,579
Come back, Superman!

943
01:31:41,662 --> 01:31:43,323
Don't leave us!

944
01:31:46,233 --> 01:31:48,224
He chickened out.

945
01:31:48,736 --> 01:31:49,794
Phony!

946
01:31:51,138 --> 01:31:53,072
Superman didn't even do nothing.

947
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:55,467
Come on, let's go.

948
01:32:02,483 --> 01:32:06,283
- There they are.
- Get away from here. Jimmy.

949
01:32:15,296 --> 01:32:17,127
Our victory is complete.

950
01:32:17,298 --> 01:32:19,061
The son of Jor-El has fled.

951
01:32:19,233 --> 01:32:21,929
- Superman fled?
- I don't believe you.

952
01:32:22,102 --> 01:32:26,163
You heard him. Three against one,
you should've taken two ears and a tail.

953
01:32:26,340 --> 01:32:29,434
- He fled in fear of us.
- He'll be back.

954
01:32:29,610 --> 01:32:31,976
As long as he's alive,
he's gonna try again.

955
01:32:32,146 --> 01:32:35,582
- The next time, we will kill him.
- The next time?

956
01:32:36,617 --> 01:32:38,676
The next time?

957
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:41,513
What am I gonna do with you people?

958
01:32:41,689 --> 01:32:44,283
I held up my end.
I delivered you the blue boy.

959
01:32:44,458 --> 01:32:46,756
What do I get from my triple threat?

960
01:32:46,927 --> 01:32:51,261
"Bow, yield, kneel."
That kind of stuff closes out a town.

961
01:32:52,833 --> 01:32:56,633
Why do you say this to me
when you know I will kill you for it?

962
01:32:56,837 --> 01:33:00,637
Kill me? Lex Luthor?

963
01:33:01,075 --> 01:33:03,839
Extinguish the greatest
criminal flame of our age?

964
01:33:04,011 --> 01:33:08,141
- Eradicate the only man on earth with...
- Let me kill him!

965
01:33:08,615 --> 01:33:10,207
- Superman's address?

966
01:33:14,088 --> 01:33:19,424
What more do you want?
I can see the greed written on your face.

967
01:33:19,593 --> 01:33:22,460
A small incentive, O Fullest One.

968
01:33:22,629 --> 01:33:25,655
A mere bauble to jog the memory.

969
01:33:26,266 --> 01:33:27,460
What more?

970
01:33:28,435 --> 01:33:29,629
Cuba.

971
01:33:37,644 --> 01:33:43,879
I trust you are not wasting my time,
Lex Luthor.

972
01:33:44,084 --> 01:33:46,314
Of course not, Your Turbulence.

973
01:34:32,499 --> 01:34:34,592
Show yourself, coward!

974
01:34:37,504 --> 01:34:39,699
Son of a coward!

975
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:47,377
I'm here, Zod.

976
01:34:47,781 --> 01:34:50,807
- Let Miss Lane go, step inside. We'll talk.
- No, don't, Superman!

977
01:34:50,984 --> 01:34:52,952
Please don't listen to him. He's just...

978
01:34:53,387 --> 01:34:54,649
Stop.

979
01:34:54,822 --> 01:34:56,813
Your powers are identical to mine.

980
01:34:56,990 --> 01:35:00,221
But we are three.
We could tear you limb from limb.

981
01:35:00,527 --> 01:35:01,755
Do it, Your Grace.

982
01:35:02,129 --> 01:35:04,290
Just grab a leg and just make a wish.

983
01:35:05,799 --> 01:35:08,199
But you are victim
to another fatal weakness...

984
01:35:08,635 --> 01:35:10,068
...your compassión.

985
01:35:10,237 --> 01:35:12,705
The death of others
means more to you than your own.

986
01:35:12,873 --> 01:35:14,340
Yes, with rare exceptions.

987
01:35:14,775 --> 01:35:20,304
Your father condemned us to an eternal
living death. Your fate will be the same.

988
01:35:20,581 --> 01:35:22,640
You will live, Kal-EI, forever...

989
01:35:22,816 --> 01:35:27,810
...as my slave. If not, then others
will pay for your obstinate attitude.

990
01:35:27,988 --> 01:35:33,517
Innocent people, millions if necessary,
beginning with this Lois person.

991
01:35:33,694 --> 01:35:35,321
- Don't, Superman, don't!
- Stop it!

992
01:35:39,533 --> 01:35:41,763
All right, Zod.

993
01:35:42,436 --> 01:35:43,869
It's over.

994
01:35:46,707 --> 01:35:50,473
Your Grace, don't believe him!
You don't know him the way that I do.

995
01:35:52,679 --> 01:35:54,874
I sense the presence of Jor-El here.

996
01:35:56,884 --> 01:35:58,749
We will destroy this place.

997
01:35:59,253 --> 01:36:00,652
And then kill him.

998
01:36:02,956 --> 01:36:04,821
Him.

999
01:36:05,993 --> 01:36:08,928
Him? Me?

1000
01:36:10,330 --> 01:36:12,264
General, this is Lex Luthor.

1001
01:36:12,933 --> 01:36:16,494
Remember...?
I helped you through the tough times.

1002
01:36:16,670 --> 01:36:18,535
I filled your inside straight.

1003
01:36:19,072 --> 01:36:23,133
You came to me with nothing.
I gave you Superman.

1004
01:36:23,310 --> 01:36:24,777
Silence!

1005
01:36:24,945 --> 01:36:26,537
Well, look...

1006
01:36:29,049 --> 01:36:30,573
Guy's a clod.

1007
01:36:31,185 --> 01:36:33,244
You think you know people, right?

1008
01:36:33,854 --> 01:36:36,982
Promises were made,
gifts were exchanged.

1009
01:36:37,157 --> 01:36:40,558
I gotta hand it to you, you know.
You always told the truth.

1010
01:36:40,761 --> 01:36:43,559
A guy always knew
where he stood with you.

1011
01:36:45,666 --> 01:36:48,533
Try to get them all
into this molecule chamber here.

1012
01:36:48,702 --> 01:36:50,829
It takes away their powers, see...

1013
01:36:51,004 --> 01:36:53,598
...and turns them into
ordinary human beings.

1014
01:36:53,774 --> 01:36:54,968
Now, if you could...

1015
01:36:58,145 --> 01:37:01,342
- Don't go in there. It's a trap.
- Luthor, you poisonous snake!

1016
01:37:01,715 --> 01:37:03,205
That's a molecule chamber.

1017
01:37:03,417 --> 01:37:07,251
It makes people like
you into people like me.

1018
01:37:07,688 --> 01:37:09,883
- You've done well, Lex Luthor.
- I thought so.

1019
01:37:11,091 --> 01:37:12,683
Seize him.

1020
01:37:14,361 --> 01:37:16,488
- Kill her.
- No! Superman, no!

1021
01:37:16,663 --> 01:37:18,790
All right! All right, leave her alone, Zod!

1022
01:37:19,333 --> 01:37:20,994
You win.

1023
01:37:24,204 --> 01:37:28,766
General, the crystal there
activates the mechanism.

1024
01:37:28,942 --> 01:37:31,775
Lex Luthor, ruler of Australia...

1025
01:37:31,945 --> 01:37:33,640
...activate the machine.

1026
01:37:44,825 --> 01:37:46,816
With your permissión.

1027
01:38:59,966 --> 01:39:02,833
And now, finally...

1028
01:39:07,074 --> 01:39:08,701
Kneel.

1029
01:39:13,213 --> 01:39:15,613
Take my hand...

1030
01:39:15,816 --> 01:39:21,584
...and swear eternal loyalty to Zod.

1031
01:40:01,661 --> 01:40:03,026
He switched it.

1032
01:40:03,663 --> 01:40:05,597
He did it to them.

1033
01:40:06,333 --> 01:40:11,737
The lights were on out here
while he was safe in there.

1034
01:40:13,106 --> 01:40:15,097
Hey, you know something?

1035
01:40:15,442 --> 01:40:17,569
You're a real pain in the neck!

1036
01:40:27,521 --> 01:40:29,318
Are you all right?

1037
01:40:30,490 --> 01:40:34,221
I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor.
A lying weasel like you couldn't resist.

1038
01:40:34,694 --> 01:40:36,559
Who, me? Are you kidding?

1039
01:40:36,730 --> 01:40:40,791
Hey, I was with you all the
time. That was beautiful.

1040
01:40:40,967 --> 01:40:43,128
Did you see the way
they fell into our trap?

1041
01:40:43,370 --> 01:40:45,804
Too late, Luthor. Too late.

1042
01:40:46,072 --> 01:40:49,269
Look. Look, Superman.

1043
01:40:49,709 --> 01:40:51,677
I got a proposition for you.

1044
01:40:51,845 --> 01:40:54,177
Now, don't stop me
till you've heard this...

1045
01:40:54,347 --> 01:40:57,612
...because I know I owe you one,
but we're in the North Pole, right?

1046
01:42:14,828 --> 01:42:16,386
Look, Lois...

1047
01:42:17,531 --> 01:42:19,829
No regrets, okay? I did it.

1048
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,594
I got the man I loved to love me.

1049
01:42:25,505 --> 01:42:29,168
- Didn't I?
- Oh, yeah.

1050
01:42:31,344 --> 01:42:34,074
Well, okay then. Those people need you.

1051
01:42:34,247 --> 01:42:36,647
Do you think I don't understand that?

1052
01:42:41,121 --> 01:42:45,524
We can still see each other, you know.
I mean, all the time.

1053
01:42:47,894 --> 01:42:50,158
But it just can't be...

1054
01:43:12,619 --> 01:43:14,849
Just don't forget, that's all.

1055
01:43:15,689 --> 01:43:17,054
Don't ever forget.

1056
01:43:41,548 --> 01:43:44,711
- Well, here we are.
- Home sweet home.

1057
01:43:45,919 --> 01:43:49,377
- See you at work in the morning.
- Bright and early, huh?

1058
01:43:49,556 --> 01:43:53,458
- The same old Clark and the same old Lois.
- Yup.

1059
01:43:54,260 --> 01:43:59,288
Except... maybe I won't be
quite so mean to you from now on.

1060
01:44:06,973 --> 01:44:08,235
You don't have to worry.

1061
01:44:08,808 --> 01:44:10,400
Your secret's safe with me.

1062
01:44:11,678 --> 01:44:15,239
I know. I know that, Lois.

1063
01:44:40,473 --> 01:44:42,873
Well, there he goes, kid.

1064
01:44:43,810 --> 01:44:45,778
Up, up and away.

1065
01:46:11,231 --> 01:46:14,029
- No!
- No!

1066
01:46:41,394 --> 01:46:43,521
- Hey, is Mr. White free?
- On the telephone.

1067
01:46:43,696 --> 01:46:47,632
- He's in conference at the moment.
- Yeah, that's what he says.

1068
01:47:03,983 --> 01:47:06,178
All right, give me three carbons of that.

1069
01:47:06,352 --> 01:47:08,684
- Hi.
- It's gonna be an insert in the paper.

1070
01:47:08,855 --> 01:47:10,584
That's what they said.

1071
01:47:12,125 --> 01:47:14,593
Good morning. Hi.

1072
01:47:20,266 --> 01:47:21,893
Good morning, Lois.

1073
01:47:27,607 --> 01:47:29,438
- Good morning, Lois.
- Hi, Clark.

1074
01:47:29,609 --> 01:47:32,339
Jeepers, I have seen
some faraway looks in my time...

1075
01:47:32,512 --> 01:47:35,743
...but with that look, you might as well
be on the North Pole.

1076
01:47:36,716 --> 01:47:38,911
The North Pole.

1077
01:47:40,119 --> 01:47:41,711
No, that's too silly.

1078
01:47:42,689 --> 01:47:48,286
Did you ever feel like you knew something
that was so important that...

1079
01:47:48,628 --> 01:47:50,459
No, you never did.

1080
01:47:51,264 --> 01:47:56,964
I mean, I feel like I'm sitting on the single
most important story of my career...

1081
01:47:57,136 --> 01:47:59,229
...and I can't remember what it is.

1082
01:47:59,772 --> 01:48:03,367
Well, knowing you,
it must have been about Superman.

1083
01:48:03,543 --> 01:48:06,808
Maybe how he saved the city or
saved the worid or saved the universe.

1084
01:48:06,980 --> 01:48:10,916
Clark, Clark. Listen.
Jealousy's really counterproductive.

1085
01:48:11,084 --> 01:48:13,780
Now, there's some things
that you can do too.

1086
01:48:14,787 --> 01:48:16,379
Oh, yeah?

1087
01:48:16,556 --> 01:48:19,320
Really? Like what?

1088
01:48:20,827 --> 01:48:22,021
Get us a pizza.

1089
01:48:22,795 --> 01:48:26,526
- A pizza. Now?
- Yeah, I'm hungry.

1090
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,525
Actually, I don't think
Mr. White would like it if...

1091
01:48:29,702 --> 01:48:31,636
I'll pay for half of it, all right?

1092
01:48:31,804 --> 01:48:33,237
I'm going.

1093
01:48:38,411 --> 01:48:39,844
Lois?

1094
01:48:40,313 --> 01:48:41,610
You know, about the pizza?

1095
01:48:42,882 --> 01:48:46,318
It's okay. I'll pay for the whole thing.

1096
01:48:48,521 --> 01:48:50,512
You know, you're really super.

1097
01:49:12,211 --> 01:49:14,611
- Hey, Ron.
- Yeah?

1098
01:49:14,781 --> 01:49:16,578
Give me another
plate of this garbage.

1099
01:49:16,749 --> 01:49:19,513
Garbage? That's my
number-one special, Rocky.

1100
01:49:19,719 --> 01:49:23,348
All right. Get me some
more coffee too, will you?

1101
01:49:24,657 --> 01:49:28,991
Gee, that's funny. I've never
seen garbage eat garbage before.

1102
01:49:37,036 --> 01:49:40,938
Excuse me, sir. I think
you're sitting in my favorite seat.

1103
01:49:41,107 --> 01:49:42,438
Come and get it, four-eyes.

1104
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:48,843
Now cool it, Rocky.

1105
01:49:50,016 --> 01:49:51,142
Take it easy, will you?

1106
01:49:51,317 --> 01:49:54,753
I just had this joint fixed.
It cost me a fortune.

1107
01:50:11,371 --> 01:50:13,464
Oh, God!

1108
01:50:25,184 --> 01:50:27,311
This order's to go.

1109
01:50:35,061 --> 01:50:38,929
I'm terribly sorry
about all the damage, sir.

1110
01:50:41,300 --> 01:50:45,202
I've been working out.

1111
01:55:45,271 --> 01:55:47,262
