1
00:01:29,772 --> 00:01:32,707
I ask you now to pronounce judgment...

2
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:34,399
...on those accused.

3
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,176
On this...

4
00:01:38,347 --> 00:01:42,511
This mindless aberration,
whose only means of expressión...

5
00:01:42,684 --> 00:01:45,050
...are wanton violence and destruction.

6
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:47,583
On the woman, Ursa...

7
00:01:48,056 --> 00:01:51,287
...whose perversions
and unreasoning hatred of all mankind...

8
00:01:51,794 --> 00:01:55,355
...have threatened even the children
of the planet Krypton.

9
00:01:56,565 --> 00:01:59,295
Finally, General Zod.

10
00:01:59,468 --> 00:02:01,698
Chief architect
of this intended revolution...

11
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:06,933
...and author of this insidious plot
to establish a new order amongst us...

12
00:02:07,309 --> 00:02:10,836
...with himself as absolute ruler.

13
00:02:11,814 --> 00:02:14,248
The decisión of the council
will now be heard.

14
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:15,713
<i>Guilty.</i>

15
00:02:16,718 --> 00:02:17,912
<i>- Guilty.
- Guilty.</i>

16
00:02:19,888 --> 00:02:21,480
<i>Guilty.</i>

17
00:02:23,826 --> 00:02:25,726
The vote must be unanimous, Jor-EI.

18
00:02:26,728 --> 00:02:29,162
It has therefore
now become your decisión.

19
00:02:29,331 --> 00:02:31,663
You alone will condemn us if you wish...

20
00:02:31,834 --> 00:02:34,769
...and you alone
will be held responsible by me.

21
00:02:45,347 --> 00:02:47,815
You will bow down before me, Jor-EI.

22
00:02:47,983 --> 00:02:49,177
I swear it.

23
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:54,345
No matter that it takes an eternity,
you will bow down before me!

24
00:02:54,523 --> 00:02:55,615
Both you...

25
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:56,983
...and then one day...

26
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:59,059
...your heirs!

27
00:03:28,457 --> 00:03:32,018
You will bow down before me!

28
00:03:33,996 --> 00:03:36,362
- Forgive me!
- I'll be back!

29
00:03:36,531 --> 00:03:37,657
Forgive me!

30
00:04:10,732 --> 00:04:15,226
<i>Your mother Lara has sent you
three blankets, of red, yellow and blue.</i>

31
00:04:16,672 --> 00:04:19,072
<i>Their protection
will ensure your strength.</i>

32
00:05:28,677 --> 00:05:32,613
It's kryptonite, Superman.
A little souvenir from the old hometown.

33
00:05:37,786 --> 00:05:42,348
You were great in your day, Superman.
But it just stands to reason...

34
00:05:42,524 --> 00:05:44,958
...when it came time
to cash in your chips...

35
00:05:45,127 --> 00:05:48,563
...this old, diseased maniac...

36
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,664
...would be your banker.

37
00:05:54,102 --> 00:05:56,036
Mind over muscle.

38
00:06:29,805 --> 00:06:32,000
Why did you kiss me first?

39
00:06:33,275 --> 00:06:36,301
It... I didn't think you'd let me later.

40
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:38,275
Stand aside, now.

41
00:08:15,443 --> 00:08:17,468
Free!

42
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:06,006
Nice fresh melons.
Nice fresh melons. Get them fresh here.

43
00:12:06,174 --> 00:12:09,041
Good for the cooking, huh?
Look at this, the best.

44
00:12:10,812 --> 00:12:13,337
"Lex Luthor's scheme bombs.
Superman saves nation.

45
00:12:13,515 --> 00:12:16,951
Master criminal draws harsh sentence.
Exclusive story by Lois Lane.

46
00:12:17,118 --> 00:12:19,245
Photographs by James Olsen."

47
00:12:19,421 --> 00:12:22,618
Luthor, you never looked lovelier.

48
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:23,951
Lois, terrific job.

49
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,093
- Thanks, chief.
- Great story, really great.

50
00:12:26,261 --> 00:12:28,456
Hey, good morning, chief. You're late.

51
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:31,531
Yeah, Miss Lane, that's a great story.
One of the best.

52
00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:36,033
Well, Jimmy, usually a picture isn't worth
a thousand words when I write the story...

53
00:12:36,204 --> 00:12:38,035
...but in this case, congratulations.

54
00:12:38,206 --> 00:12:39,571
- Yeah, thanks a lot.
- Yeah.

55
00:12:40,642 --> 00:12:44,078
There's Mr. Kent. Bet he wishes
he'd been around when it all happened.

56
00:12:44,245 --> 00:12:46,770
Clark, he's never around
when Superman appears.

57
00:12:46,948 --> 00:12:48,438
Poor guy.

58
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,252
- You got a page in the front?
- Yeah.

59
00:13:02,363 --> 00:13:04,695
Miss Lane got the best story.

60
00:13:12,073 --> 00:13:14,007
Good morning, Lois.

61
00:13:15,376 --> 00:13:16,673
Hi.

62
00:13:54,148 --> 00:13:56,446
Lane, Kent, get in here!

63
00:13:56,618 --> 00:13:58,449
Now, see, Jimmy,
you got me in trouble.

64
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,783
- We were talking.
- So long. A big mistake.

65
00:14:02,624 --> 00:14:04,956
Next time, don't do that to me.

66
00:14:05,293 --> 00:14:08,922
- Good morning, Lois. How are you today?
- Oh, I'm just super. Thanks.

67
00:14:09,097 --> 00:14:10,758
- Good morning, Mr. White.
- I'm super.

68
00:14:10,932 --> 00:14:14,299
- Yeah, morning. You're late, Kent.
- I know. I'm sorry, Mr. White.

69
00:14:14,469 --> 00:14:16,733
- I got stuck in traffic.
- Oh, that's a new one.

70
00:14:16,905 --> 00:14:18,668
- Excuse me?
- I mean, as opposed to:

71
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,298
"I was stuck in a phone booth" or
"I got locked into the men's bathroom."

72
00:14:22,477 --> 00:14:25,105
Lois, what are you talking about?
I'm sorry I was late.

73
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,044
If you two wanna bicker,
I have just the assignment for you.

74
00:14:28,216 --> 00:14:32,209
You're gonna pose as a honeymoon couple
to get an exposé on the newlywed racket.

75
00:14:32,387 --> 00:14:36,084
Some of those hotels are bilking
those poor kids for every cent they can get.

76
00:14:36,257 --> 00:14:39,488
Real human-interest stuff.
Make your Aunt Hattie cry her eyes out.

77
00:14:39,761 --> 00:14:42,787
- Newlyweds?
- That is a great idea, Mr. White.

78
00:14:42,964 --> 00:14:46,593
- I'm sorry, but I'm in the middle of a series...
- I mean, it wouldn't take long.

79
00:14:46,768 --> 00:14:51,262
We could just fly right up there
and zoom back down again.

80
00:14:51,439 --> 00:14:53,703
No, Superman?

81
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:57,072
Yeah. If he'd give you two a ride,
maybe we could save a couple bucks.

82
00:14:57,345 --> 00:14:59,711
I gotta see young Olsen.
Six lousy photographs...

83
00:14:59,881 --> 00:15:04,318
...and that kid's hitting me up for a raise.
- Excuse me. Mr. White? Could we talk?

84
00:15:04,485 --> 00:15:06,009
Darn.

85
00:15:06,955 --> 00:15:09,856
You look like the cat who swallowed
the canary this morning.

86
00:15:10,024 --> 00:15:13,858
A canary? No, actually I was
thinking of something bigger...

87
00:15:14,028 --> 00:15:16,997
...something that flies,
something more in blue.

88
00:15:17,465 --> 00:15:19,433
Lois, as usual, I'm totally in the dark...

89
00:15:19,601 --> 00:15:22,832
Let me just turn on the lights
for you then.

90
00:15:24,739 --> 00:15:26,502
Get the picture?

91
00:15:28,409 --> 00:15:32,004
I didn't put this together until
this morning. Which is really strange...

92
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,479
...because a good reporter isn't supposed to
let anything slip by her.

93
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:38,084
Well, that's very amusing. Yes.

94
00:15:38,252 --> 00:15:39,719
- Excuse me.
- Amusing?

95
00:15:39,887 --> 00:15:44,290
- Yes, sirree, that's... That's very amusing.
- Amusing, huh?

96
00:15:44,525 --> 00:15:48,621
Tall, broad shoulders...

97
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,055
...dark hair.

98
00:15:51,232 --> 00:15:54,167
Gotta give you credit,
you really had me fooled.

99
00:15:54,335 --> 00:15:56,929
And I'm nobody's fool...

100
00:15:57,739 --> 00:15:59,468
...Superman.

101
00:15:59,941 --> 00:16:01,272
Superman?

102
00:16:01,442 --> 00:16:05,606
You mean you think I'm Superman?

103
00:16:06,247 --> 00:16:09,375
- Willing to bet my life on it.
- Lois, you know, you are priceless.

104
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,542
Really. That is the single most
ridiculous thing I've ever...

105
00:16:13,955 --> 00:16:16,822
- Lois, what are you doing?
- You wouldn't let me die, Superman.

106
00:16:56,798 --> 00:17:00,461
- Oh, God.
- Help her out. Help her out.

107
00:17:00,868 --> 00:17:03,666
- Clark!
- Lois, what have you done?

108
00:17:04,072 --> 00:17:06,700
Clark, the... You're not...

109
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:12,643
Hey, Clark, you seen Lois?

110
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,380
She just stepped out for a minute.

111
00:17:34,802 --> 00:17:37,794
This is how it ends for
the greatest criminal mind of our time.

112
00:17:37,972 --> 00:17:40,236
Not with a whimper, not with a bang.

113
00:17:40,408 --> 00:17:42,933
How do they choose
to reward Lex Luthor...

114
00:17:43,111 --> 00:17:45,045
...the greatest genius in this worid?

115
00:17:45,213 --> 00:17:49,115
Do they give him glory or treasure?
What, matter of fact, do they give him?

116
00:17:49,283 --> 00:17:53,379
Life plus 25, Luthor. Get to work.

117
00:17:57,692 --> 00:18:00,320
Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor.
It almost worked.

118
00:18:00,495 --> 00:18:03,328
I mean, California almost
fell down, right in the ocean.

119
00:18:03,498 --> 00:18:05,295
Millions of people was almost killed.

120
00:18:05,466 --> 00:18:08,663
If it hadn't been for that guy
Superman, that overgrown Boy Scout.

121
00:18:08,836 --> 00:18:12,067
- I want my Liberace record back tonight.
- Tonight?

122
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,303
What are you gonna do with a guy like that?
He flies around so fast and everything.

123
00:18:18,312 --> 00:18:21,509
I mean, they can't even trace
that guy on that radar they got.

124
00:18:21,716 --> 00:18:24,651
Every time they try, he just flies off.

125
00:18:24,819 --> 00:18:26,184
- Where?
- North.

126
00:18:26,387 --> 00:18:28,184
Why?

127
00:18:28,356 --> 00:18:29,653
To ski?

128
00:18:29,824 --> 00:18:33,225
Otis, every man has his vulnerable point.

129
00:18:33,394 --> 00:18:36,625
Some, like you, Otis,
have more than one.

130
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:38,732
I didn't see Superman's in time.

131
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,529
But now, through patience,
invention, and skill...

132
00:18:43,571 --> 00:18:46,665
...my little black box
is just about ready.

133
00:18:46,841 --> 00:18:50,072
Oh, that little black box in our cell?

134
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,140
That little black box, Mr. Luthor...

135
00:18:57,685 --> 00:18:59,585
...what's it for?

136
00:18:59,754 --> 00:19:05,556
That little black box goes beyond
any normal, conventional radar.

137
00:19:05,726 --> 00:19:08,388
It tracks alpha waves.

138
00:19:10,898 --> 00:19:13,560
Alpha waves. Yeah.

139
00:19:13,734 --> 00:19:16,464
<i>I could've said it tracked pasta e fagioli,
couldn't I?</i>

140
00:19:16,637 --> 00:19:20,266
Oh, with garlic, Mr. Luthor. And butter.

141
00:19:20,441 --> 00:19:21,840
Boy.

142
00:19:25,012 --> 00:19:30,575
Those alpha waves will
take me north to his secret.

143
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:35,484
And when I have his secret,
I'll have Superman.

144
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:41,123
Slasher Fogelstein's a bed wetter.

145
00:19:45,766 --> 00:19:49,702
Slasher Fogelstein's a bed wetter.
Pass it.

146
00:19:55,176 --> 00:19:57,110
Hi, Mr. Fogelstein.

147
00:19:57,578 --> 00:20:00,103
- Too fast. Can you get the speed right?

148
00:20:00,281 --> 00:20:03,216
I told you, they installed those
three weeks ago.

149
00:20:04,151 --> 00:20:05,140
Hey.

150
00:20:06,053 --> 00:20:10,251
You follow the bouncing ball for a while.
Thing's giving me a headache.

151
00:20:10,424 --> 00:20:13,518
Anyway, somebody's
gotta check up on those guys.

152
00:20:13,694 --> 00:20:16,527
Yeah, I keep on forgetting about them.

153
00:20:16,697 --> 00:20:19,461
How long they been up there, 45 days?

154
00:20:19,634 --> 00:20:22,569
The whole worid's forgotten about it.

155
00:20:24,805 --> 00:20:26,966
<i>Houston calling Artemis II.</i>

156
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,608
<i>Houston calling Artemis II. Come in.</i>

157
00:20:30,778 --> 00:20:33,338
<i>Morning, Houston. Hold on, Nate.</i>

158
00:20:33,514 --> 00:20:35,448
<i>- Yo.
- How are things going?</i>

159
00:20:36,217 --> 00:20:38,685
All systems normal, Houston.

160
00:20:38,853 --> 00:20:41,754
Andy is out doing the geological survey.

161
00:20:41,923 --> 00:20:44,221
<i>More rocks. Nice.</i>

162
00:20:44,392 --> 00:20:47,486
And cosmonaut Boris
is getting some soil samples.

163
00:20:47,662 --> 00:20:50,222
By the way, Boris and I are engaged.

164
00:20:50,731 --> 00:20:53,859
I had a feeling about you guys
when I saw your Rorschach tests.

165
00:20:54,035 --> 00:20:56,333
Just a little détente
humor there, Houston.

166
00:20:56,504 --> 00:20:58,495
<i>Surface conditions unchanged?</i>

167
00:20:58,673 --> 00:21:01,699
Well, it's mighty
pretty out there. Mighty...

168
00:21:03,844 --> 00:21:05,903
<i>...pretty.
- Mighty pretty.</i>

169
00:21:06,113 --> 00:21:08,240
<i>Right.</i>

170
00:21:08,616 --> 00:21:10,481
<i>Look, Nate?</i>

171
00:21:10,651 --> 00:21:12,243
<i>Nate, wake up, will you?</i>

172
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,980
That's it. I'm dreaming.

173
00:21:15,156 --> 00:21:17,420
<i>Artemis, come in.</i>

174
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:21,686
Well, Houston, we seem to have
an unidentified flying object.

175
00:21:21,862 --> 00:21:23,261
Unidentified?

176
00:21:23,931 --> 00:21:26,559
<i>- What does it look like?
- Well...</i>

177
00:21:26,734 --> 00:21:29,430
...a lot like a girl.

178
00:21:50,758 --> 00:21:52,555
You.

179
00:21:53,294 --> 00:21:56,786
- What kind of a creature are you?
- Just a man.

180
00:21:57,565 --> 00:21:59,658
A man?

181
00:22:56,424 --> 00:22:59,154
What a fragile sort of life form this is.

182
00:23:24,518 --> 00:23:27,180
Houston, come in. Come in, Houston.

183
00:23:35,696 --> 00:23:37,095
Come in, Houston. Come in.

184
00:23:37,264 --> 00:23:38,891
Attempting manual liftoff.

185
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,328
Can somebody hear me?

186
00:23:40,801 --> 00:23:42,632
Houston!

187
00:23:43,637 --> 00:23:44,763
Come on.

188
00:23:47,641 --> 00:23:49,438
Come on, Houston!

189
00:23:50,311 --> 00:23:52,745
Oh, no. No!

190
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,145
Somebody help me!

191
00:24:01,722 --> 00:24:04,714
<i>- Artemis, Houston calling. Come in.
- What's going on?</i>

192
00:24:04,892 --> 00:24:08,328
- I don't know. We've lost contact.
- So?

193
00:24:08,496 --> 00:24:10,191
Well, we really...

194
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:12,629
<i>Artemis, come in, please.</i>

195
00:24:14,969 --> 00:24:18,666
All right, which one of you guys
is using the hair dryer?

196
00:24:21,008 --> 00:24:25,843
Strange. I tore those
metal fibers like paper.

197
00:24:26,013 --> 00:24:29,949
And what he did was amazing.

198
00:24:30,117 --> 00:24:34,554
- Something is happening.
- Yes, to all of us.

199
00:24:36,757 --> 00:24:40,955
The closer we come to an
atmosphere with only one sun...

200
00:24:41,128 --> 00:24:42,959
...a yellow sun...

201
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:47,089
...the more our molecular
density gives us unlimited powers.

202
00:24:47,268 --> 00:24:49,065
They come from there.

203
00:24:49,236 --> 00:24:51,227
A place called Houston.

204
00:24:51,405 --> 00:24:53,805
Then we will go there too...

205
00:24:53,974 --> 00:24:55,908
...to rule.

206
00:24:56,377 --> 00:24:59,039
Finally, to rule.

207
00:25:09,523 --> 00:25:11,252
Three-eighty-two, out.

208
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,525
Three-eighty-three, out.

209
00:25:15,296 --> 00:25:17,560
Three-eighty-four, out.

210
00:25:18,532 --> 00:25:20,830
Three-eighty-five, out.

211
00:25:24,205 --> 00:25:26,537
Lights out, Luthor.

212
00:25:27,107 --> 00:25:29,337
I said, lights out.

213
00:25:31,912 --> 00:25:35,609
You guys are about 10 seconds
away from solitary, you know that?

214
00:25:37,718 --> 00:25:39,743
I told you to...

215
00:25:55,236 --> 00:25:57,397
Freeze, freeze.

216
00:26:30,271 --> 00:26:32,171
Mr. Luthor.

217
00:26:33,507 --> 00:26:35,998
- How we gonna get over that wall?
- How'd we get in?

218
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:39,370
- We flew in here, remember?
- That's how we'll get out.

219
00:26:39,546 --> 00:26:41,878
Oh, no, not that guy.

220
00:26:45,686 --> 00:26:47,415
Did you just go "psst"?

221
00:26:47,588 --> 00:26:50,751
I wish I had, Mr. Luthor, before we left.

222
00:26:52,393 --> 00:26:54,657
Not that "psst," that "psst."

223
00:26:58,032 --> 00:27:00,830
- Don't go "psst" when I go "psst."
- You do it.

224
00:27:04,338 --> 00:27:06,499
Go out there and find it.

225
00:27:07,207 --> 00:27:11,667
- What am I looking for?
- You'll know when you see it.

226
00:27:22,856 --> 00:27:25,552
I think I found it.

227
00:27:30,731 --> 00:27:32,596
What is it?

228
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,467
It's a ladder, you dummy.

229
00:27:37,237 --> 00:27:38,670
Hi, Miss Teschmacher.

230
00:27:47,648 --> 00:27:48,808
Come on.

231
00:27:49,616 --> 00:27:53,245
Hurry up. Hurry up.

232
00:27:53,821 --> 00:27:56,051
Come on, hurry.

233
00:27:57,057 --> 00:27:59,423
Otis, hold that ladder. Hurry up.

234
00:27:59,593 --> 00:28:03,427
<i>- Yard line, touchdown!
Oh, what a beautiful play.</i>

235
00:28:03,597 --> 00:28:06,327
<i>But there's a marker downfield.
It could be against...</i>

236
00:28:11,905 --> 00:28:12,963
- Come up.
- Come on.

237
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,734
Here I come, Mr. Luthor.

238
00:28:17,511 --> 00:28:18,671
- Get off. Get off.
- Otis!

239
00:28:20,481 --> 00:28:23,177
- We're sinking!
- Get off, get off!

240
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,361
Very good,
Miss Teschmacher. Very good.

241
00:28:42,536 --> 00:28:45,232
- What am I doing here? Why am I here?
- Miss Teschmacher...

242
00:28:45,406 --> 00:28:47,306
...is this a philosophy seminar?

243
00:28:47,474 --> 00:28:49,203
- No. This is a getaway.
- No.

244
00:28:49,376 --> 00:28:50,604
- Getaway.
- Right.

245
00:28:50,778 --> 00:28:53,770
It's ingenious. I don't know
where you got the inspiration from.

246
00:28:53,947 --> 00:28:55,676
I got it from you, Lex.

247
00:28:56,617 --> 00:28:58,551
Hot air rises.

248
00:29:00,421 --> 00:29:02,150
Would you like to take a trip?

249
00:29:02,322 --> 00:29:04,586
A trip? A vacation.

250
00:29:04,758 --> 00:29:07,625
Lex, I can go shopping.
I can buy a bikini.

251
00:29:07,795 --> 00:29:10,195
You thought about me in a bikini
while in prison?

252
00:29:10,531 --> 00:29:12,863
No, I didn't, actually.

253
00:29:13,033 --> 00:29:16,298
I thought about you in a parka.

254
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,597
You thought about me in a parka?

255
00:29:18,772 --> 00:29:21,002
You are sick, Lex. You are really sick.

256
00:29:21,742 --> 00:29:23,232
That's possible.

257
00:29:27,047 --> 00:29:28,844
North, Miss Teschmacher.

258
00:29:29,016 --> 00:29:30,210
Due north.

259
00:29:31,552 --> 00:29:33,076
Lex, north.

260
00:29:34,555 --> 00:29:36,750
That's what I said, due north.

261
00:29:37,257 --> 00:29:39,589
- That's what you said.
- I know I said I said that.

262
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,523
- I just heard it.
- Yes, Lex.

263
00:29:41,695 --> 00:29:44,061
Don't repeat what I say
when I say something.

264
00:29:44,231 --> 00:29:46,392
- I won't repeat what you say.
- Okay, don't.

265
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:48,831
Well, stop repeating me.

266
00:30:16,296 --> 00:30:18,127
Excuse me.

267
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:24,865
Would you like to carry Mrs. Smith
over the threshold?

268
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:26,801
It's sort of traditional.

269
00:30:26,974 --> 00:30:29,807
I can give you a hand
if you have trouble lifting.

270
00:30:29,977 --> 00:30:33,504
- No, of course not.
- Honey. Thanks, I'll walk.

271
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,079
Certainly, dear.

272
00:30:45,459 --> 00:30:47,324
Mush! Mush!

273
00:30:47,494 --> 00:30:49,519
I am mushing.

274
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:54,801
North, Miss Teschmacher.

275
00:30:54,968 --> 00:30:59,064
- North, north!
- Yes, Lex. North.

276
00:31:26,466 --> 00:31:29,731
Oh, you must be wrong, Lex.
This couldn't be his home way up here.

277
00:31:29,903 --> 00:31:31,598
"Wrong, Lex."

278
00:31:31,772 --> 00:31:35,333
Miss Teschmacher, those are two words
we do not use in the same sentence.

279
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:38,410
Well, it's funny there's no front door.

280
00:31:38,579 --> 00:31:43,380
Miss Teschmacher, "funny" is a person
trying to smile without any teeth.

281
00:31:45,886 --> 00:31:46,875
Right.

282
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,521
All right, come on, Lex. Come on.

283
00:31:55,696 --> 00:31:57,561
Move out of the way.

284
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,429
- This way.
- It's this way.

285
00:32:01,602 --> 00:32:03,331
Lex, it's this way.

286
00:32:03,503 --> 00:32:05,403
It's this way, Lex.

287
00:32:05,806 --> 00:32:08,934
- Come on. Come on.
- Get off!

288
00:32:12,613 --> 00:32:14,171
Come on.

289
00:32:26,093 --> 00:32:28,084
- Fantastic.
- Fantastic.

290
00:32:28,862 --> 00:32:31,262
It's fantastic!

291
00:32:35,102 --> 00:32:38,868
The construction goes far beyond
any known architectural theory.

292
00:32:42,109 --> 00:32:44,407
- It's beautiful.
- It's beautiful.

293
00:32:44,945 --> 00:32:46,310
- Lex.
- I'll be all right.

294
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,175
No, me.

295
00:32:51,952 --> 00:32:53,886
Why can't you be more careful?

296
00:32:56,289 --> 00:32:57,950
- It's beautiful.
- Beautiful.

297
00:32:58,125 --> 00:33:00,559
- It has everything.
- Wrong.

298
00:33:01,995 --> 00:33:06,125
- Why didn't you go before we left?
- That was two days ago.

299
00:33:09,703 --> 00:33:11,295
Be careful, Lex.

300
00:33:14,174 --> 00:33:15,471
Get...!

301
00:33:16,476 --> 00:33:20,310
Frankly, I think this place
is a little boring. It's all white.

302
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,778
Why doesn't the guy
put up some pictures?

303
00:33:22,949 --> 00:33:25,474
Maybe some bullfighting posters.

304
00:33:29,489 --> 00:33:31,923
- Don't touch anything.
- Don't touch anything.

305
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:36,520
- Ice.
- I said, don't touch it.

306
00:33:37,264 --> 00:33:39,630
- It's not ice.
- It looks like a crystal.

307
00:34:02,989 --> 00:34:07,824
<i>The virtuous spirit has no need
for thankful approval...</i>

308
00:34:08,028 --> 00:34:10,189
<i>- What the...?
...owning a certain conviction...</i>

309
00:34:10,363 --> 00:34:13,196
<i>... that what has been done is right.</i>

310
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,527
That's the old man.
He looks just like the kid.

311
00:34:15,702 --> 00:34:18,569
- Are you the old man?
- Ask him where the bathroom is.

312
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:21,173
<i>Develop such conviction in yourself.</i>

313
00:34:21,441 --> 00:34:22,669
Are you here?

314
00:34:22,876 --> 00:34:26,869
<i>- The human heart on your planet...
- He's not here.</i>

315
00:34:27,047 --> 00:34:31,381
It's a voice from the past.
That's cute. That's really cute. Nice.

316
00:34:31,551 --> 00:34:33,542
<i>Lies, monstrous deceptions.</i>

317
00:34:36,923 --> 00:34:39,391
So much for moral rearmament.

318
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:41,424
Give me another crystal.

319
00:34:51,304 --> 00:34:54,831
<i>Education crystal 108. Earth culture.</i>

320
00:34:55,609 --> 00:34:59,636
<i>A typical ode much loved by the people
you will live among, Kal-EI.</i>

321
00:34:59,813 --> 00:35:02,407
<i>Trees by Joyce Kilmer.</i>

322
00:35:02,983 --> 00:35:04,814
<i>I think that I shall never see</i>

323
00:35:04,985 --> 00:35:07,886
<i>A poem as lovely as a tree.</i>

324
00:35:09,823 --> 00:35:11,313
Come on, I like trees.

325
00:35:11,491 --> 00:35:13,925
So does your average cocker spaniel.
Give me another.

326
00:35:14,094 --> 00:35:15,789
Cute.

327
00:35:22,269 --> 00:35:23,395
<i>My son...</i>

328
00:35:23,737 --> 00:35:25,568
- The man never ages.
- Never ages.

329
00:35:25,739 --> 00:35:30,870
<i>... the time has come to tell you of
the darkest episode in Krypton history.</i>

330
00:35:31,044 --> 00:35:33,774
<i>- Now, this I wanna hear.
- Unfortunately...</i>

331
00:35:33,947 --> 00:35:37,246
<i>... even on our peaceful planet...</i>

332
00:35:37,551 --> 00:35:39,781
<i>... there have appeared
once in a great while...</i>

333
00:35:39,953 --> 00:35:43,218
<i>... certain antisocial elements.</i>

334
00:35:43,557 --> 00:35:44,956
<i>Deviants...</i>

335
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:47,059
<i>... what you call on Earth "criminals."</i>

336
00:35:47,327 --> 00:35:48,555
Criminals.

337
00:35:48,728 --> 00:35:51,219
Deviants. He was right in the first place.

338
00:35:51,398 --> 00:35:54,367
<i>Though of course, we are not
a penalty planet like Earth...</i>

339
00:35:54,534 --> 00:35:58,095
<i>... and these unhappy souls were almost
always successfully transformed...</i>

340
00:35:58,271 --> 00:36:01,172
<i>...into productive citizens.
- You never heard of Lex Luthor?</i>

341
00:36:01,341 --> 00:36:04,674
<i>There were, however, three exceptions...
Only three.</i>

342
00:36:04,845 --> 00:36:07,541
<i>- Who proved impossible to rehabilitate.</i>

343
00:36:08,281 --> 00:36:09,373
There's hope.

344
00:36:09,549 --> 00:36:11,710
<i>Non, the destroyer.</i>

345
00:36:11,885 --> 00:36:16,185
<i>Unreasoning violence
in the shape of a being.</i>

346
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:20,924
<i>Ursa. Vicious, cruel, obsessed
by a single-minded hatred...</i>

347
00:36:21,094 --> 00:36:23,119
<i>... which could never be determined.</i>

348
00:36:23,296 --> 00:36:25,264
<i>And the one force
that could unite them...</i>

349
00:36:25,432 --> 00:36:29,994
<i>... the only one whose warped genius
could harness these forces of evil:</i>

350
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:31,432
<i>General Zod.</i>

351
00:36:31,605 --> 00:36:34,472
<i>- He looks kind of cute.
- His intended insurrection...</i>

352
00:36:34,708 --> 00:36:38,974
<i>... was the most painful episode
our people ever had to endure.</i>

353
00:36:39,412 --> 00:36:41,471
<i>But after a long and terrible battle...</i>

354
00:36:42,082 --> 00:36:44,744
<i>... peace and harmony
were once again restored.</i>

355
00:36:44,918 --> 00:36:46,442
Kind of an anticlimax.

356
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,987
<i>We had, of course, no death penalty.</i>

357
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:51,948
Sensible enough.

358
00:36:52,492 --> 00:36:55,518
<i>And so they were placed
in the Phantom Zone...</i>

359
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,528
<i>... to be imprisoned for all eternity.</i>

360
00:37:03,236 --> 00:37:06,467
<i>I do not know what could be done
if they were to escape.</i>

361
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,401
<i>On Krypton, these
villains were uncontrollable.</i>

362
00:37:09,576 --> 00:37:14,309
<i>On Earth, each of them
would have the identical powers...</i>

363
00:37:15,215 --> 00:37:16,978
<i>... that you have.</i>

364
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:21,846
Think of it. Three super villains.

365
00:37:22,022 --> 00:37:24,923
All three with the same power he has.

366
00:37:25,091 --> 00:37:29,255
All three totally dedicated
to corruption, violence, evil.

367
00:37:31,164 --> 00:37:34,065
They need a contact on Earth.

368
00:37:34,267 --> 00:37:37,065
Someone who felt the same as they did,
someone who...

369
00:37:37,237 --> 00:37:41,674
...had the same wonderful contempt for
life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

370
00:37:42,475 --> 00:37:44,636
Too true to be good.

371
00:37:45,845 --> 00:37:47,244
Right?

372
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,518
- Miss Teschmacher?
- I found it.

373
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:58,787
I think.

374
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:02,424
- Where's Jimmy Olsen when I need him?
- Golly, isn't it beautiful?

375
00:38:02,595 --> 00:38:05,462
Yeah, it's gorgeous. Gorgeous.

376
00:38:05,665 --> 00:38:06,927
- Lois?
- Yeah?

377
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:11,935
Look. Everybody's holding hands.
Maybe we should hold hands too, huh?

378
00:38:12,105 --> 00:38:15,199
- Here's my hand, Clark. Hold it.
- Thanks.

379
00:38:16,042 --> 00:38:18,602
You know what? They're afraid to let go.

380
00:38:18,778 --> 00:38:21,713
- Why?
- They let go, straight to the lawyer.

381
00:38:21,881 --> 00:38:24,748
Oh, I don't know about that.
They look kind of happy to me.

382
00:38:24,918 --> 00:38:27,284
That's because you're blind, Clark.

383
00:38:27,721 --> 00:38:29,313
- Oh, yeah.
- Here.

384
00:38:29,489 --> 00:38:31,320
- No, I've got it. No, l...
- Yeah. Clark.

385
00:38:31,491 --> 00:38:34,585
You've gotta look after yourself.
You've only got one pair of eyes.

386
00:38:34,761 --> 00:38:36,422
- God.
- Lois?

387
00:38:36,596 --> 00:38:37,756
- Now, here.
- Right.

388
00:38:37,931 --> 00:38:40,798
- Don't say I never did anything for you.
- Thank you.

389
00:38:44,504 --> 00:38:45,903
Son! Excuse me, please.

390
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:47,570
- Be careful.
- What are you doing?

391
00:38:47,741 --> 00:38:49,766
Get down! Get down!

392
00:38:52,445 --> 00:38:55,937
You embarrass me
here in front of everybody.

393
00:38:58,351 --> 00:39:01,809
Lois, did you see what almost
happened there? That little boy...

394
00:39:02,655 --> 00:39:05,681
Hey, I'm hungry. You hungry?

395
00:39:05,859 --> 00:39:08,191
- Lois, you're amazing.
- Why, because I'm hungry?

396
00:39:08,361 --> 00:39:12,195
No. Here you are standing in front of one
of nature's most awesome spectacles...

397
00:39:12,365 --> 00:39:15,334
...and you're thinking about
food. Aren't you impressed?

398
00:39:15,502 --> 00:39:18,938
Clark, once a girl's seen
Superman in action...

399
00:39:19,105 --> 00:39:21,596
...Niagara Falls kind of
leaves you cold, you know?

400
00:39:21,775 --> 00:39:23,538
Him again, huh?

401
00:39:24,611 --> 00:39:26,044
Oh, I'm sorry.

402
00:39:26,246 --> 00:39:28,510
I have a one-track mind, don't I?

403
00:39:28,681 --> 00:39:31,878
Well, my one-track mind is
telling me that I'm hungry.

404
00:39:32,052 --> 00:39:33,144
- Hot dog?
- Hot dog.

405
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:34,718
Hot dog.

406
00:39:34,888 --> 00:39:36,446
Could I have some orange juice?

407
00:39:36,623 --> 00:39:38,682
- Freshly squeezed.
- Freshly squeezed, I know.

408
00:39:45,999 --> 00:39:47,990
Hey, Mom. Look!

409
00:39:48,168 --> 00:39:50,159
Yeah, honey. That's nice.

410
00:39:53,006 --> 00:39:56,237
Okay, it's two mustard and relish, and...

411
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,670
Oh, my God!

412
00:40:02,782 --> 00:40:04,340
Help!

413
00:40:04,517 --> 00:40:06,280
Help!

414
00:40:07,487 --> 00:40:09,717
Somebody help!

415
00:40:11,124 --> 00:40:12,989
Do something!

416
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:18,519
Good.

417
00:40:19,866 --> 00:40:21,163
Hey, Superman!

418
00:40:22,936 --> 00:40:24,699
Way to go, Superman!

419
00:40:28,108 --> 00:40:29,166
We got a great shot.

420
00:40:29,342 --> 00:40:32,334
What a nice man.
Of course he's Jewish.

421
00:40:35,982 --> 00:40:37,472
Incredible.

422
00:40:45,024 --> 00:40:47,322
- There you go.
- Again, again!

423
00:40:47,494 --> 00:40:50,725
No, I'm sorry.
Only one ride to a customer.

424
00:40:50,897 --> 00:40:54,856
- Superman. Superman, it's me, it's Lois!
- Bye.

425
00:40:55,034 --> 00:40:57,229
Come here. You're gonna get it!

426
00:40:57,403 --> 00:41:00,839
- Give me a heart attack here.
- It's me. It's Lois.

427
00:41:01,007 --> 00:41:03,168
It's Lois Lane.

428
00:41:03,743 --> 00:41:06,303
Well, hello and goodbye.

429
00:41:31,771 --> 00:41:35,070
So this is planet Houston.

430
00:41:37,277 --> 00:41:39,438
A very strange surface.

431
00:42:07,807 --> 00:42:09,536
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, that's all right.

432
00:42:09,709 --> 00:42:12,701
- I just didn't hear you knock, that's all.
- Lois...

433
00:42:12,879 --> 00:42:16,371
...the door wasn't even locked.
Just anybody can walk in here.

434
00:42:16,549 --> 00:42:19,177
- There you go putting yourself down again.
- Very funny.

435
00:42:19,352 --> 00:42:21,445
No, really, I'm serious.

436
00:42:22,555 --> 00:42:24,250
Well, anyway...

437
00:42:24,424 --> 00:42:27,655
...here, a little something for
the newlyweds' dinner tonight.

438
00:42:27,827 --> 00:42:30,489
Pansies. Clark, how...
How different.

439
00:42:30,663 --> 00:42:33,063
Would you believe
they grow wild all around here?

440
00:42:33,233 --> 00:42:35,531
You should see what they
charge for roses at the gift shop.

441
00:42:35,702 --> 00:42:37,465
I'll bet, huh?

442
00:42:39,072 --> 00:42:40,596
- You know something, Lois?
- What?

443
00:42:40,773 --> 00:42:45,267
Well, you know, in spite of
the unreality of all this...

444
00:42:45,445 --> 00:42:48,710
Well, you know, posing as newlyweds
for the sake of a newspaper story.

445
00:42:48,881 --> 00:42:50,940
Well, in spite of myself even...

446
00:42:51,117 --> 00:42:53,847
...I'm kind of starting to
feel like one in a way.

447
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:57,615
- A newlywed, you?
- I don't see why that should be so strange.

448
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:59,417
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

449
00:42:59,592 --> 00:43:02,720
I mean, I'm sure there's
thousands of giris who'd...

450
00:43:03,263 --> 00:43:05,026
Well, a few giris anyway.

451
00:43:05,198 --> 00:43:07,189
- Go ahead and say it.
- Say what?

452
00:43:07,367 --> 00:43:12,828
That somehow you're not satisfied
being here with me.

453
00:43:13,873 --> 00:43:18,708
That in some way I don't seem to
shape up very well in your eyes.

454
00:43:18,878 --> 00:43:21,711
I don't have anything to apologize for.
I'm a good reporter.

455
00:43:21,881 --> 00:43:25,942
No, I'm a very good reporter.
And an even better friend to you.

456
00:43:26,953 --> 00:43:28,420
- Stand up.
- Stand up?

457
00:43:28,721 --> 00:43:30,188
Yeah, stand up, just for fun.

458
00:43:32,692 --> 00:43:36,321
Now, come here. Look at yourself.
Just look at yourself.

459
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:41,494
What we have here is
a potentially aggressive, dynamite guy...

460
00:43:41,668 --> 00:43:43,295
...who can do anything he wants.

461
00:43:43,469 --> 00:43:46,131
I mean, it's not my fault
you keep putting yourself down.

462
00:43:46,306 --> 00:43:48,331
- Oh, yeah? How?
- Well, for starters...

463
00:43:48,508 --> 00:43:50,976
...you slouch all the time.
Here, stand up straight.

464
00:43:51,144 --> 00:43:52,736
There, that's better.

465
00:43:52,912 --> 00:43:56,370
And get yourself a jacket with a vent
and shoes that don't lace up...

466
00:43:56,549 --> 00:44:00,349
...and a shirt with a little color
or a pattern or something.

467
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:03,114
And a bow tie that doesn't look
like a letter opener.

468
00:44:03,289 --> 00:44:05,553
All right, Lois. All right.

469
00:44:05,725 --> 00:44:09,161
- We've been through this, haven't we?
- Yes.

470
00:44:09,962 --> 00:44:12,897
I know where this is all leading to.

471
00:44:14,334 --> 00:44:17,098
And I'm sorry. I mean, I'm sorry...

472
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:20,137
...but no matter how hard I try, I just...

473
00:44:20,306 --> 00:44:22,866
Just... Just never will be him.

474
00:44:23,042 --> 00:44:24,407
Him who?

475
00:44:24,577 --> 00:44:28,104
"Him who"? Him Superman.

476
00:44:28,281 --> 00:44:31,478
Now, I can't help the fact that
you seem to think that you love him.

477
00:44:31,651 --> 00:44:35,314
That's something I'll have to live with.
But darn it, Lois, that's enough now.

478
00:44:36,456 --> 00:44:39,016
Maybe I just can't stand
the competition anymore.

479
00:44:39,192 --> 00:44:42,525
And just maybe you've been
the competition all along.

480
00:44:42,695 --> 00:44:45,095
Lois, I've never been
particularly good at riddles.

481
00:44:45,264 --> 00:44:47,528
Let me make this one really easy for you.

482
00:44:47,767 --> 00:44:51,703
Why, with thousands of children
potentially falling off something lethal...

483
00:44:51,871 --> 00:44:55,739
...all around the worid, would Superman
be in Niagara Falls today?

484
00:44:55,908 --> 00:44:57,307
Why not the Grand Canyon?

485
00:44:57,477 --> 00:45:01,311
- Ask the child's family. I'm sure they know.
- Why is it always when I'm with you...

486
00:45:01,481 --> 00:45:04,939
...until Superman appears?
And then you seem to disappear.

487
00:45:05,118 --> 00:45:08,849
- Very conveniently, it seems to me.
- I was out for hot dogs. For Pete's sake...

488
00:45:09,021 --> 00:45:11,717
When Superman appeared,
I looked at that hot dog stand...

489
00:45:11,891 --> 00:45:13,119
...and you were gone.

490
00:45:13,292 --> 00:45:14,486
- I was...
- Nowhere.

491
00:45:16,062 --> 00:45:17,996
I can't help it if I had to go to the...

492
00:45:18,831 --> 00:45:21,061
You are Superman, aren't you?

493
00:45:21,234 --> 00:45:24,726
Lois, look, we've been through
these hallucinations of yours before.

494
00:45:24,904 --> 00:45:26,701
Can't you see what you almost did?

495
00:45:26,873 --> 00:45:29,137
Throwing yourself off a building
30 stories high?

496
00:45:29,308 --> 00:45:31,538
Can't you see the tragic mistake
you almost made?

497
00:45:31,711 --> 00:45:35,647
Yeah, I made a mistake.
I made a mistake because...

498
00:45:37,517 --> 00:45:39,508
...I risked my life instead of yours.

499
00:45:39,685 --> 00:45:41,744
Lois, don't be insane.

500
00:45:41,921 --> 00:45:45,118
And don't fall down because
you're just gonna have to get up again.

501
00:45:45,291 --> 00:45:47,350
Lois, now, don't be crazy now. Lois!

502
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:01,433
It is you.

503
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,706
I guess I've known this
for the longest time.

504
00:46:13,586 --> 00:46:15,383
You realize, of course...

505
00:46:15,555 --> 00:46:18,547
...if you'd been wrong,
Clark Kent would have been killed.

506
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,688
With a blank?

507
00:46:26,065 --> 00:46:27,259
Gotcha.

508
00:46:51,591 --> 00:46:54,287
A primitive sort of life form.

509
00:47:03,436 --> 00:47:04,664
Did you see that?

510
00:47:05,972 --> 00:47:08,167
Did you see what I did?

511
00:47:08,341 --> 00:47:10,901
I have powers beyond reason here.

512
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:13,041
We all have them, my dear.

513
00:47:55,454 --> 00:47:58,582
- Wow, this is your home?
- No.

514
00:47:58,758 --> 00:48:01,818
Actually, I live in the city,
about three blocks from you.

515
00:48:03,296 --> 00:48:05,628
No, this is a very special place for me.

516
00:48:05,798 --> 00:48:08,096
I wanted you to see it.

517
00:48:08,501 --> 00:48:10,696
Listen, you warm enough?

518
00:48:11,971 --> 00:48:14,030
I guess I should be freezing, but I'm not.

519
00:48:14,206 --> 00:48:15,833
Good.

520
00:48:16,008 --> 00:48:18,169
Come on, let me show you.

521
00:48:37,129 --> 00:48:38,323
I don't know.

522
00:48:39,265 --> 00:48:42,462
From the look of them,
I'll bet $ 10 they're from Los Ángeles.

523
00:48:51,811 --> 00:48:55,679
Hey, you hippies,
get your butts off the road!

524
00:48:56,048 --> 00:48:59,142
I like the globe. It flashes
red like our Krypton sun.

525
00:48:59,552 --> 00:49:01,747
But not this irritating noise.

526
00:49:02,421 --> 00:49:04,252
Make way.

527
00:49:05,124 --> 00:49:06,887
Did I hear right?

528
00:49:07,059 --> 00:49:08,856
That son of a bitch give me an order?

529
00:49:09,395 --> 00:49:11,386
Duane, you take care of it.

530
00:49:16,435 --> 00:49:19,199
Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing here?

531
00:49:19,372 --> 00:49:21,397
What is this symbol?

532
00:49:21,574 --> 00:49:23,371
Do you follow another leader?

533
00:49:23,542 --> 00:49:25,874
Follow the leader?

534
00:49:27,046 --> 00:49:29,412
Holy skunk sweat.

535
00:49:29,582 --> 00:49:31,777
- All right.
- A weapon of some sort.

536
00:49:41,627 --> 00:49:43,356
How the hell did you do that?

537
00:49:51,003 --> 00:49:52,436
Jesus H. Christ.

538
00:49:54,974 --> 00:49:58,375
- That was good.
- I thought we might...

539
00:49:59,845 --> 00:50:02,439
...abandon the orange juice for once.

540
00:50:09,822 --> 00:50:12,484
- Here, cheers.
- Cheers.

541
00:50:16,796 --> 00:50:19,890
Must be tough being Clark Kent, isn't it?

542
00:50:20,266 --> 00:50:22,996
No. No, I really...

543
00:50:23,169 --> 00:50:25,330
I really like it sometimes.

544
00:50:25,504 --> 00:50:27,665
Even though I do
make a fool of myself.

545
00:50:29,375 --> 00:50:33,812
But, you know, if it weren't for him,
I never would have met you.

546
00:50:35,715 --> 00:50:39,151
But he is you.

547
00:50:39,919 --> 00:50:43,252
- It's kind of confusing.
- Not to me, it isn't.

548
00:50:45,691 --> 00:50:47,124
Everything's clear.

549
00:50:51,797 --> 00:50:55,563
Until yesterday, a middle-American town
that Middle America had forgotten.

550
00:50:55,735 --> 00:51:00,138
But today, the population...
Exaggerated reports put it at 123.

551
00:51:00,306 --> 00:51:01,739
- Has increased by three.

552
00:51:01,907 --> 00:51:04,933
And these three new arrivals
bring destruction in their wake.

553
00:51:05,111 --> 00:51:07,807
As I look west into
East Houston this morning...

554
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:11,177
<i>...I see a town gripped with fear.
- Who's the guy?</i>

555
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:13,318
<i>Get that guy. Follow the guy.</i>

556
00:51:13,486 --> 00:51:15,113
<i>Who's the big guy?</i>

557
00:51:15,921 --> 00:51:17,821
<i>Okay, yeah, we've got a...</i>

558
00:51:18,157 --> 00:51:19,852
<i>- You got that?
- No.</i>

559
00:51:24,163 --> 00:51:25,960
<i>- That's fine.
- Try to wiggle it.</i>

560
00:51:26,132 --> 00:51:28,066
Who else is seeing this?

561
00:51:28,234 --> 00:51:32,102
Well, with this satellite linkup,
just about everybody. The whole planet.

562
00:51:32,271 --> 00:51:34,466
The whole planet Houston?

563
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,007
Earth. The whole planet Earth.

564
00:51:40,312 --> 00:51:42,371
You may continue.

565
00:51:42,548 --> 00:51:46,211
As the extraordinary story continues...

566
00:51:47,253 --> 00:51:49,278
- Enough of this man.
- As this extraordinary...

567
00:51:49,455 --> 00:51:52,891
If the whole planet is watching,
let's show them something interesting.

568
00:51:53,058 --> 00:51:55,788
<i>Throw down your arms and surrender!</i>

569
00:51:56,362 --> 00:51:58,830
<i>This is an order.</i>

570
00:52:00,866 --> 00:52:04,427
General Zod does not
take orders. He gives them.

571
00:52:26,826 --> 00:52:29,818
He was in the line of that fire
and nothing happened to him.

572
00:52:29,995 --> 00:52:32,259
I haven't seen the likes
of this since Superman.

573
00:52:33,165 --> 00:52:34,894
<i>Yes? Yes.</i>

574
00:52:35,067 --> 00:52:39,800
<i>The Newsbeat control room has informed
me that a fleet of helicopter gunships is...</i>

575
00:52:39,972 --> 00:52:43,499
- Mr. President, sir, can't we...?
- There's nothing anybody can do.

576
00:52:43,676 --> 00:52:45,974
They have such powers,
nothing can stop them.

577
00:52:46,145 --> 00:52:47,578
Where's Superman?

578
00:52:47,746 --> 00:52:50,806
Where is he?
Why doesn't he do something?

579
00:53:03,229 --> 00:53:04,423
<i>Fire again.</i>

580
00:53:06,732 --> 00:53:08,199
<i>Fire again.</i>

581
00:53:11,437 --> 00:53:14,895
Look. They need machines to fly.

582
00:53:15,708 --> 00:53:18,370
<i>- Banking now.
- What bravery.</i>

583
00:53:18,711 --> 00:53:22,670
Be nice to them, my dear.
Blow them a kiss.

584
00:53:25,584 --> 00:53:28,280
<i>Rockets ready. Coming in on target.
Wait, wait.</i>

585
00:53:30,422 --> 00:53:31,616
<i>We're out of control.</i>

586
00:53:33,726 --> 00:53:37,025
<i>We're coming in, coming down.
Can't control it!</i>

587
00:53:37,196 --> 00:53:38,458
<i>We're coming down.</i>

588
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:46,370
I win.

589
00:53:47,773 --> 00:53:49,866
I always win.

590
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:54,343
Is there no one on
this planet to even challenge me?

591
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:15,800
Come forward.

592
00:54:16,135 --> 00:54:18,035
Your general wishes to speak.

593
00:54:18,304 --> 00:54:22,536
I am General Zod, your ruler.

594
00:54:23,876 --> 00:54:27,903
Yes, today begins a new order!

595
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:30,648
Your lands, your possessions...

596
00:54:30,816 --> 00:54:35,776
...your very lives will gladly be
given in tribute to me.

597
00:54:36,322 --> 00:54:38,483
In return for your obedience...

598
00:54:38,657 --> 00:54:41,319
...you will enjoy my generous protection.

599
00:54:41,493 --> 00:54:45,361
In other words,
you will be allowed to live.

600
00:54:47,866 --> 00:54:50,858
So you are a general?

601
00:54:51,904 --> 00:54:54,065
And who is your superior?

602
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:59,971
- I answer only to the president.
- And he will answer to me.

603
00:55:01,246 --> 00:55:05,046
Or all of his cities
will end up like this one.

604
00:55:11,056 --> 00:55:14,685
Thousands of hours to create,
and they defaced it in seconds.

605
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:17,988
Imagine what they'll do
to the worid if we resist.

606
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:25,233
<i>The people of your planet
are well-pleased with you, Kal-EI.</i>

607
00:55:25,404 --> 00:55:29,135
<i>You have served them faithfully,
and they are grateful for it.</i>

608
00:55:31,043 --> 00:55:36,071
<i>And yet you have returned
to reason with me once again.</i>

609
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:41,519
<i>My son, I have tried to anticipate
your every question.</i>

610
00:55:41,687 --> 00:55:43,518
<i>This was one I'd...</i>

611
00:55:44,957 --> 00:55:46,891
<i>I'd hoped you would not ask.</i>

612
00:55:50,062 --> 00:55:52,030
My attachment...

613
00:55:54,066 --> 00:55:59,368
...the feelings which I have developed
for a certain human being...

614
00:55:59,671 --> 00:56:02,003
...have deeply affected me, Father.

615
00:56:02,174 --> 00:56:06,634
<i>You cannot serve humanity by investing
your time and emotion in one human being...</i>

616
00:56:06,812 --> 00:56:08,939
<i>... at the expense of the rest.</i>

617
00:56:09,148 --> 00:56:13,949
<i>- The concepts are mutally exclusive.
- And...</i>

618
00:56:15,754 --> 00:56:19,952
...if I no longer wish
to serve humanity...

619
00:56:20,893 --> 00:56:24,329
<i>Is this how you repay their gratitude?</i>

620
00:56:24,496 --> 00:56:28,296
<i>By abandoning the weak,
the defenseless, the needy...</i>

621
00:56:28,467 --> 00:56:31,095
<i>... for the sake of your selfish pursuits?</i>

622
00:56:31,303 --> 00:56:34,739
Selfish? After all I've done for them?

623
00:56:34,907 --> 00:56:37,501
Will there ever come a time
when I've served enough?

624
00:56:37,676 --> 00:56:40,236
At least they get a chance for happiness.

625
00:56:40,412 --> 00:56:43,040
I only ask as much, no more.

626
00:56:43,782 --> 00:56:46,478
<i>Yours is a higher happiness.</i>

627
00:56:46,652 --> 00:56:51,021
<i>The fulfillment of your missión,
an inspiration you must have felt.</i>

628
00:56:51,623 --> 00:56:54,558
<i>You must have felt
that happiness within you.</i>

629
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:57,988
<i>My son, surely you cannot
deny that feeling.</i>

630
00:56:58,363 --> 00:57:01,696
No, I cannot...

631
00:57:02,401 --> 00:57:06,235
...any more than I can deny the other,
which is stronger in me, Father.

632
00:57:07,673 --> 00:57:08,901
So much stronger.

633
00:57:14,913 --> 00:57:17,040
Is there no way then, Father?

634
00:57:17,683 --> 00:57:21,642
Must I finally be denied
the one thing in life which I truly desire?

635
00:57:23,322 --> 00:57:26,120
<i>If you will not be Kal-EI...</i>

636
00:57:26,492 --> 00:57:28,426
<i>... if you will live as one of them...</i>

637
00:57:28,994 --> 00:57:30,985
<i>... love their kind as one of them...</i>

638
00:57:31,563 --> 00:57:33,758
<i>... then it follows that you must...</i>

639
00:57:34,466 --> 00:57:36,559
<i>... become one of them.</i>

640
00:58:05,063 --> 00:58:10,899
<i>This crystal chamber has in it the
harnessed rays of the red sun of Krypton.</i>

641
00:58:11,403 --> 00:58:12,802
<i>Once exposed to them...</i>

642
00:58:12,971 --> 00:58:16,498
<i>... all your great powers
on Earth will disappear.</i>

643
00:58:17,442 --> 00:58:18,932
<i>Forever.</i>

644
00:58:19,611 --> 00:58:21,636
<i>Once this is done, there's no going back.</i>

645
00:58:23,115 --> 00:58:25,515
<i>You will feel like an ordinary man.</i>

646
00:58:26,552 --> 00:58:29,612
<i>And you can be harmed
like an ordinary man.</i>

647
00:58:31,823 --> 00:58:33,688
<i>Think, Kal-EI.</i>

648
00:58:35,127 --> 00:58:36,788
<i>I beg you.</i>

649
00:58:37,863 --> 00:58:39,490
Father...

650
00:58:40,732 --> 00:58:41,960
...I love her.

651
00:59:00,018 --> 00:59:01,508
<i>Think, Kal-EI.</i>

652
01:00:58,337 --> 01:00:59,998
Come on. Come on.

653
01:01:10,882 --> 01:01:12,076
Look out!

654
01:02:03,301 --> 01:02:05,201
You are the one they call president?

655
01:02:05,971 --> 01:02:07,598
I am.

656
01:02:09,674 --> 01:02:13,542
I see you are practiced
in worshipping things that fly.

657
01:02:14,913 --> 01:02:16,608
Good.

658
01:02:17,482 --> 01:02:19,643
Rise before Zod.

659
01:02:23,622 --> 01:02:26,591
Now, kneel before Zod.

660
01:02:40,806 --> 01:02:42,330
You are not the president.

661
01:02:42,641 --> 01:02:47,408
No one who leads so many
could possibly kneel so quickly.

662
01:02:47,579 --> 01:02:49,376
I am the man they are protecting.

663
01:02:50,715 --> 01:02:52,580
I am the president.

664
01:02:53,518 --> 01:02:55,748
I'll kneel before you
if it will save lives.

665
01:02:56,188 --> 01:02:57,917
It will.

666
01:02:58,089 --> 01:03:00,649
Starting with your own.

667
01:03:04,362 --> 01:03:07,559
What a backward planet this must be...

668
01:03:07,999 --> 01:03:10,832
...where the men wear the ribbons...

669
01:03:11,369 --> 01:03:12,996
...and the jewelry.

670
01:03:26,451 --> 01:03:28,351
What I do now...

671
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:31,717
...I do for the sake of
the people of the worid.

672
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:35,883
But there is one man here on Earth
who will never kneel before you.

673
01:03:36,194 --> 01:03:39,459
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?

674
01:03:39,631 --> 01:03:41,622
I wish I knew.

675
01:03:45,971 --> 01:03:47,336
Oh, God.

676
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:49,363
Zod.

677
01:03:52,010 --> 01:03:53,443
Hey.

678
01:03:53,612 --> 01:03:56,137
You're awfully quiet over there.

679
01:03:57,849 --> 01:04:01,148
Yeah, I was just thinking...

680
01:04:01,319 --> 01:04:04,846
...I can't believe what
you've given up for me.

681
01:04:05,657 --> 01:04:09,184
Are you kidding? I didn't do
it for you, Lois, I did it for us.

682
01:04:09,794 --> 01:04:12,854
See, I told you there'd be
a hot dog place somewhere.

683
01:04:13,031 --> 01:04:16,967
Okay. It sure takes longer
when you can't fly.

684
01:04:17,135 --> 01:04:18,864
Hurry up.

685
01:04:19,037 --> 01:04:20,937
- Come on.
- Okay.

686
01:04:24,142 --> 01:04:26,474
Come on, it's my treat. Come on.

687
01:04:30,215 --> 01:04:32,581
Oh, boy, it's Mr. Wonderful.

688
01:04:34,219 --> 01:04:36,483
Thank you.

689
01:04:38,723 --> 01:04:41,453
- Do you have a men's room?
- Yeah. Right in the corner.

690
01:04:41,626 --> 01:04:44,151
- Want to sit down?
- Yeah.

691
01:04:46,131 --> 01:04:47,621
Hi, what would you folks like?

692
01:04:47,799 --> 01:04:51,394
I'd like a cheeseburger with
everything on it, and a Coke...

693
01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:55,233
...an order of fries
and a side salad, please.

694
01:04:56,274 --> 01:04:59,266
- And for you, sir?
- I'll think about it when I get back.

695
01:04:59,444 --> 01:05:00,968
Right. That's one cheeseburger...

696
01:05:01,212 --> 01:05:03,874
- Steak and eggs, over easy, coffee.
- Can I have my Coke?

697
01:05:04,049 --> 01:05:05,812
Coming right up.

698
01:05:06,184 --> 01:05:09,676
- I'm sorry, that seat's taken.
- It is now, sweetheart.

699
01:05:10,822 --> 01:05:12,790
Can I buy you something to eat?

700
01:05:13,458 --> 01:05:15,153
No, thank you.

701
01:05:16,061 --> 01:05:18,359
Excuse me. I think
you're sitting in my seat.

702
01:05:19,197 --> 01:05:21,688
Your seat's in there, four-eyes.

703
01:05:24,703 --> 01:05:28,571
Gee, I think perhaps somebody
ought to teach you some manners, sir.

704
01:05:29,708 --> 01:05:32,199
Yeah? Well, let me
know when he comes in.

705
01:05:32,377 --> 01:05:34,868
- Look, Clark, we can just...
- Honey.

706
01:05:36,181 --> 01:05:38,581
Excuse me, sir, would
you care to step outside?

707
01:05:38,783 --> 01:05:41,513
I said, excuse me, sir,
would you care to step outside?

708
01:05:44,789 --> 01:05:47,519
Now, listen, Rocky,
your steak's coming right up.

709
01:05:48,093 --> 01:05:51,859
Keep it on the flame, Ron.
This is just a minute steak.

710
01:05:53,098 --> 01:05:54,656
After you.

711
01:05:55,333 --> 01:05:57,198
- Clark.
- It's all right, honey.

712
01:06:00,505 --> 01:06:01,597
Clark!

713
01:06:03,808 --> 01:06:05,241
You all right, fella?

714
01:06:05,410 --> 01:06:08,174
He's gonna be fine,
just give me that.

715
01:06:08,513 --> 01:06:12,040
- Clark?
- Blood. It's my blood.

716
01:06:12,884 --> 01:06:17,082
I think maybe we ought to
hire a bodyguard from now on.

717
01:06:17,255 --> 01:06:20,713
I don't want a bodyguard.
I want the man I fell in love with.

718
01:06:20,892 --> 01:06:23,019
I know that, Lois.

719
01:06:23,194 --> 01:06:25,424
I wish he were here.

720
01:06:31,102 --> 01:06:32,831
Clark.

721
01:06:34,205 --> 01:06:37,436
Boy, you just don't have
enough sense to stay down, do you?

722
01:06:44,416 --> 01:06:48,614
You... You... You are no good.

723
01:06:49,354 --> 01:06:51,549
Settle down!

724
01:06:52,123 --> 01:06:54,557
I don't like your meat anyway.

725
01:06:56,728 --> 01:06:58,593
Oh, God.

726
01:07:05,670 --> 01:07:08,639
Clark? Clark?

727
01:07:08,807 --> 01:07:10,604
Clark, can you get up?

728
01:07:10,809 --> 01:07:13,471
- All right. Come on. I got you.
- Go slow. Go slow.

729
01:07:13,678 --> 01:07:15,441
Try and get up in that chair.

730
01:07:17,282 --> 01:07:19,944
- Sit down.
- I'm all right. I'm all right.

731
01:07:21,386 --> 01:07:24,981
Okay, everybody, he's all right.
Just relax. We'll have some fresh coffee.

732
01:07:25,156 --> 01:07:27,454
I'll turn the box on.

733
01:07:28,293 --> 01:07:31,126
<i>We interrupt this program
for an urgent message...</i>

734
01:07:31,296 --> 01:07:34,197
<i>... from the President
of the United States.</i>

735
01:07:34,432 --> 01:07:36,764
<i>This is your president.</i>

736
01:07:37,035 --> 01:07:41,870
<i>On behalf of my country, and in the
name of the other leaders of the worid...</i>

737
01:07:42,373 --> 01:07:45,103
<i>... with whom I have today consulted...</i>

738
01:07:45,643 --> 01:07:48,407
<i>... I hereby abdicate...</i>

739
01:07:48,646 --> 01:07:52,912
<i>... all authority and
control over this planet...</i>

740
01:07:53,451 --> 01:07:54,975
<i>... to General Zod.</i>

741
01:07:55,787 --> 01:07:56,981
Zod.

742
01:07:57,155 --> 01:08:00,682
<i>Only by strict compliance
with all his directions...</i>

743
01:08:01,493 --> 01:08:05,452
<i>... will the lives of
innocent millions be spared.</i>

744
01:08:05,997 --> 01:08:07,589
<i>Superman, can you hear me?</i>

745
01:08:07,766 --> 01:08:11,532
<i>- Superman, where...?
- Who is this Superman?</i>

746
01:08:11,703 --> 01:08:17,767
<i>- You'll find out. And when you do...
- Come to me, Superman, if you dare.</i>

747
01:08:17,942 --> 01:08:19,534
<i>I defy you.</i>

748
01:08:19,711 --> 01:08:23,169
<i>Come! Come and kneel before Zod.</i>

749
01:08:25,617 --> 01:08:27,050
<i>Zod!</i>

750
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:30,383
- Here? When?
- When?

751
01:08:30,555 --> 01:08:34,321
Where the hell have you been, Mac?
On a desert island?

752
01:08:37,061 --> 01:08:38,790
I have to go back.

753
01:08:38,963 --> 01:08:40,931
You can't go back.

754
01:08:41,099 --> 01:08:43,624
- There's no way now.
- I have to.

755
01:08:43,802 --> 01:08:46,999
I've gotta try, damn it. I've
gotta try something, anything.

756
01:08:47,172 --> 01:08:50,039
It's not your fault.

757
01:08:50,208 --> 01:08:53,609
You didn't know this was gonna happen.

758
01:08:55,013 --> 01:08:56,844
He knew.

759
01:08:57,015 --> 01:08:59,279
I heard him.

760
01:08:59,450 --> 01:09:01,714
I just didn't listen.

761
01:09:18,369 --> 01:09:20,963
You're master of all you survey.

762
01:09:21,172 --> 01:09:23,106
And so I was yesterday.

763
01:09:23,274 --> 01:09:25,765
And the day before.

764
01:09:39,724 --> 01:09:40,918
Hello, there.

765
01:09:42,493 --> 01:09:44,393
Lex Luthor.

766
01:09:46,798 --> 01:09:48,925
Lex Luthor.

767
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:52,301
You've heard the name?
The greatest criminal mind on Earth.

768
01:09:52,837 --> 01:09:55,465
I told you this was a puny planet.

769
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:57,267
Wait just a moment.

770
01:09:57,442 --> 01:10:00,570
Wait until you get to know
me better. Will you, please?

771
01:10:00,745 --> 01:10:04,442
Wait. Look, I can give
you anything you want.

772
01:10:04,616 --> 01:10:06,607
I can give you the brass ring...

773
01:10:06,784 --> 01:10:11,517
...the unlimited freedom
to maim, kill, destroy.

774
01:10:12,023 --> 01:10:16,619
Plus, Lex Luthor's keen mind.
Lex Luthor's savvy.

775
01:10:16,794 --> 01:10:21,128
Lex Luthor's career guidance.
Lex Luthor's School of Better...

776
01:10:23,034 --> 01:10:25,502
We have all of this without you.

777
01:10:26,304 --> 01:10:28,465
You cannot bargain
with what you don't have.

778
01:10:29,173 --> 01:10:31,334
Magnificent One...

779
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:35,711
...what I am bargaining with
is what you do not have.

780
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:37,245
The son of Jor-EI.

781
01:10:41,052 --> 01:10:43,350
The son of Jor-EI?

782
01:10:43,721 --> 01:10:45,211
I said that, didn't I?

783
01:10:45,723 --> 01:10:48,385
Jor-EI, our jailer?

784
01:10:48,626 --> 01:10:50,787
No, Jor-EI, the baseball player.

785
01:10:50,962 --> 01:10:52,953
Yes, Jor-EI, your jailer.

786
01:10:53,264 --> 01:10:56,756
- The son of Jor-EI? On this planet?
- Aye.

787
01:10:56,935 --> 01:10:59,529
<i>Possibly you know him better
by his nom de voyage...</i>

788
01:10:59,704 --> 01:11:02,798
...or his name he travels under:

789
01:11:02,974 --> 01:11:04,771
Superman.

790
01:11:07,078 --> 01:11:08,739
So this is Superman.

791
01:11:10,081 --> 01:11:11,378
How do you know of Jor-EI?

792
01:11:11,549 --> 01:11:15,986
My Fullness, as I
explained to you before...

793
01:11:17,055 --> 01:11:18,545
...I'm about the best there is.

794
01:11:18,723 --> 01:11:20,020
Revenge.

795
01:11:20,191 --> 01:11:22,182
We will kill the son of our jailer.

796
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:25,329
- Revenge.
- Revenge! Now we're cooking.

797
01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:27,521
- He flies, then?
- Constantly.

798
01:11:27,699 --> 01:11:29,724
- He has powers as we do?
- Certainly.

799
01:11:29,901 --> 01:11:34,235
But, Magnificent One...

800
01:11:34,405 --> 01:11:37,238
...he's just one...

801
01:11:37,408 --> 01:11:39,968
...where you are three.

802
01:11:40,712 --> 01:11:44,113
- Or four, if you count him twice.
- We will bring him to his knees.

803
01:11:44,382 --> 01:11:46,043
Wait!

804
01:11:47,618 --> 01:11:48,880
First, you must find him.

805
01:11:49,187 --> 01:11:52,486
And Lex Baby is the only
one who knows where he is.

806
01:11:54,025 --> 01:11:56,516
What do you want?

807
01:11:56,728 --> 01:11:58,855
Well, general...

808
01:11:59,030 --> 01:12:01,590
...the worid is a big place.

809
01:12:01,766 --> 01:12:04,200
Thank goodness...

810
01:12:04,369 --> 01:12:06,337
...my needs are small.

811
01:12:07,772 --> 01:12:13,608
As it turns out, I have this
affinity for beachfront property.

812
01:12:15,346 --> 01:12:17,837
What do you want?

813
01:12:18,016 --> 01:12:19,779
Australia.

814
01:12:51,315 --> 01:12:52,839
Hey.

815
01:12:55,586 --> 01:13:00,046
Listen... Hey, come on,
where are you...? Please!

816
01:13:37,628 --> 01:13:39,220
Father?

817
01:13:41,833 --> 01:13:43,892
If you can hear me...

818
01:13:45,603 --> 01:13:47,503
...I failed.

819
01:13:49,907 --> 01:13:51,807
I failed you...

820
01:13:52,110 --> 01:13:53,873
...I failed myself...

821
01:13:55,746 --> 01:13:57,839
...and all humanity.

822
01:14:00,751 --> 01:14:02,912
I've traded my birthright...

823
01:14:04,021 --> 01:14:08,822
...for a life of submissión in a worid
that's now ruled by your enemies.

824
01:14:10,528 --> 01:14:13,019
There's nobody left to help them now...

825
01:14:13,831 --> 01:14:15,765
...the people of the worid.

826
01:14:16,834 --> 01:14:18,859
Not since I...

827
01:14:19,770 --> 01:14:22,898
Father!

828
01:15:33,961 --> 01:15:38,557
<i>Listen carefully, my son,
for we shall never speak again.</i>

829
01:15:40,434 --> 01:15:43,028
<i>If you hear me now...</i>

830
01:15:43,203 --> 01:15:46,229
<i>... then you have made use
of the only means left to you:</i>

831
01:15:47,141 --> 01:15:51,077
<i>The crystal source through which
our communications begun.</i>

832
01:15:52,046 --> 01:15:54,446
<i>The circle is now complete.</i>

833
01:15:54,815 --> 01:15:58,012
<i>You have made a dreadful mistake, Kal-EI.</i>

834
01:16:01,422 --> 01:16:04,949
<i>You did this of your own free will...</i>

835
01:16:05,492 --> 01:16:08,290
<i>... in spite of all I could say
to dissuade you.</i>

836
01:16:10,597 --> 01:16:12,189
I...

837
01:16:12,366 --> 01:16:16,860
<i>Now you have returned to me
for one last chance to redeem yourself.</i>

838
01:16:17,037 --> 01:16:21,940
<i>This too finally I have anticipated,
my son.</i>

839
01:16:24,611 --> 01:16:26,772
<i>Look at me, Kal-EI.</i>

840
01:16:29,216 --> 01:16:33,812
<i>Once before when you were small,
I died...</i>

841
01:16:35,055 --> 01:16:38,024
<i>... while giving you a chance for life.</i>

842
01:16:39,159 --> 01:16:43,118
<i>And now, even though it will exhaust
the final energy left within me...</i>

843
01:16:43,831 --> 01:16:45,662
Father, no.

844
01:16:47,167 --> 01:16:49,635
<i>Look at me, Kal-EI.</i>

845
01:16:52,373 --> 01:16:57,174
<i>The Kryptonian prophecy
will be at last fulfilled.</i>

846
01:16:57,478 --> 01:17:03,007
<i>The son becomes the father,
the father becomes the son.</i>

847
01:17:07,521 --> 01:17:11,423
<i>Farewell forever, Kal-EI.</i>

848
01:17:14,695 --> 01:17:17,163
<i>Remember me, my son.</i>

849
01:17:47,194 --> 01:17:48,786
My son.

850
01:18:04,378 --> 01:18:06,073
Father!

851
01:18:19,726 --> 01:18:23,184
Harold. Coffee, black, no sugar.

852
01:18:23,363 --> 01:18:26,457
Black, no sug... Yeah. Yeah.

853
01:18:27,334 --> 01:18:28,892
Who's paying, huh?

854
01:18:29,937 --> 01:18:32,667
No, no! There's three of them.
That cockamamie general...

855
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:36,970
...and a big truck with hair on it and a broad
that looks like the queen of the runway.

856
01:18:37,144 --> 01:18:41,877
They can fly, they can see through things.
Anything Superman can do, they can do.

857
01:18:42,349 --> 01:18:44,647
Where is he, anyway?

858
01:18:44,852 --> 01:18:46,843
Maybe he hasn't heard
about it yet, chief.

859
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:49,181
- Maybe...
- Maybe he's just run out of guts.

860
01:18:49,356 --> 01:18:51,984
- No sugar. And don't call me "chief."
- He'll be here.

861
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:55,686
- Lf there's any way at all, he'll be here.
- Yeah, he'll be here.

862
01:18:58,232 --> 01:19:00,496
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

863
01:19:01,201 --> 01:19:03,101
- Hey, Charlie, you feel that?
- Yeah.

864
01:19:03,403 --> 01:19:04,802
Sounds like an earthquake.

865
01:19:06,907 --> 01:19:08,465
Oh, my!

866
01:19:14,581 --> 01:19:17,243
- It's those three.
- Stop!

867
01:19:17,417 --> 01:19:20,716
- Oh, my God, they're here now!
- Oh, no!

868
01:19:32,299 --> 01:19:33,527
This is scary!

869
01:20:22,616 --> 01:20:24,743
You all right, chief?

870
01:20:25,252 --> 01:20:26,651
Hi.

871
01:20:28,589 --> 01:20:31,490
You should see the White House.
They'll be cleaning for months.

872
01:20:31,658 --> 01:20:32,989
Lex Luthor.

873
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:34,788
Wouldn't you know it?

874
01:20:35,429 --> 01:20:38,262
This is the son of Jor-EI?

875
01:20:38,432 --> 01:20:40,332
- No, but I bet you're a son of a...
- Jimmy!

876
01:20:41,568 --> 01:20:44,560
You promised me the son of Jor-EI.

877
01:20:46,039 --> 01:20:47,199
Yes, Your Grace.

878
01:20:47,808 --> 01:20:51,403
But what I've given
you is the next best thing.

879
01:20:51,578 --> 01:20:54,604
You just hold on to that
little lady, and he'll be along.

880
01:20:54,781 --> 01:20:56,339
See, they have this relationship.

881
01:20:56,516 --> 01:21:00,850
She does all his public relations,
and he gives her every exclusive.

882
01:21:01,021 --> 01:21:03,683
They're the best of friends.
You know what I mean?

883
01:21:04,024 --> 01:21:07,255
What an undemanding
male this Superman must be.

884
01:21:07,694 --> 01:21:10,322
You could use a tuck
here and there yourself, sister.

885
01:21:10,831 --> 01:21:12,423
Wait!

886
01:21:12,599 --> 01:21:13,964
- I'm sorry!
- She lives for now.

887
01:21:14,901 --> 01:21:17,267
Kill the rest, starting with him.

888
01:21:19,806 --> 01:21:22,297
Wait. Wait, wait, wait!

889
01:21:22,476 --> 01:21:24,034
Wait. Wait.

890
01:21:24,211 --> 01:21:28,307
Don't you remember the White House?
The Oval Room? We had a few laughs there.

891
01:21:28,882 --> 01:21:30,440
You ought to have that fixed.

892
01:21:42,029 --> 01:21:43,223
General...

893
01:21:44,131 --> 01:21:46,258
...haven't you heard
of freedom of the press?

894
01:21:46,466 --> 01:21:48,491
- Superman!
- Superman, thank God.

895
01:21:49,469 --> 01:21:50,834
I mean, get him!

896
01:21:51,238 --> 01:21:53,069
Come to me, son of Jor-EI!

897
01:21:53,573 --> 01:21:56,406
Kneel before Zod!

898
01:22:11,024 --> 01:22:13,015
Watch out. You all right?

899
01:22:32,612 --> 01:22:34,170
Son of Jor-EI.

900
01:22:34,648 --> 01:22:37,208
We were beginning to
think you were a coward.

901
01:22:37,584 --> 01:22:38,846
I'm not a coward, Zod.

902
01:22:39,119 --> 01:22:42,179
It is extremely likely
you are merely a fool.

903
01:22:42,356 --> 01:22:44,722
Like father, like son.

904
01:23:01,007 --> 01:23:02,406
Look out!

905
01:23:05,479 --> 01:23:08,243
Then die as you deserve to!

906
01:23:18,392 --> 01:23:20,587
Come on, come on, Superman! Get him!

907
01:23:20,861 --> 01:23:22,920
Man, this is gonna be good.

908
01:23:58,932 --> 01:24:00,524
<i>Superman.</i>

909
01:24:21,555 --> 01:24:23,921
- Hey, that's the chief's.
- The chief's got it.

910
01:24:32,632 --> 01:24:34,600
What, you hit a woman?

911
01:24:57,724 --> 01:25:00,887
Oh, my God! My baby!

912
01:25:01,261 --> 01:25:03,695
Help my baby!

913
01:25:06,566 --> 01:25:08,261
Thank you.

914
01:25:09,836 --> 01:25:13,397
This Superman is nothing of the kind.

915
01:25:13,607 --> 01:25:16,007
- I've discovered his weakness.
- Yes.

916
01:25:16,176 --> 01:25:17,575
He cares.

917
01:25:17,844 --> 01:25:21,109
He actually cares
for these Earth people.

918
01:25:21,281 --> 01:25:24,444
- Like pets?
- I suppose so.

919
01:25:32,626 --> 01:25:34,526
I'll draw his fire...

920
01:25:34,694 --> 01:25:36,628
...with some of my own.

921
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:05,851
What's happening to those cars?

922
01:26:09,296 --> 01:26:10,763
Get out of the way!

923
01:27:25,939 --> 01:27:27,031
Superman.

924
01:28:12,585 --> 01:28:13,984
Oh, thank you!

925
01:28:14,154 --> 01:28:16,714
I never thought this thing
would go the distance.

926
01:28:30,937 --> 01:28:33,030
No! Don't do it!

927
01:28:33,473 --> 01:28:35,134
The people!

928
01:28:39,779 --> 01:28:41,576
Throw it!

929
01:29:02,802 --> 01:29:06,101
- Get away from there. Get away from there.
- Let's help them out!

930
01:29:09,642 --> 01:29:13,100
- I got her. I got her. Don't worry.
- He's dead.

931
01:29:14,748 --> 01:29:16,739
Superman is dead.

932
01:29:19,986 --> 01:29:21,248
They've killed Superman.

933
01:29:22,689 --> 01:29:24,987
- He's dead.
- Let's go get them!

934
01:29:25,158 --> 01:29:27,752
- Come on, we'll show them!
- I know some judo. Let's go!

935
01:29:28,294 --> 01:29:29,818
Come on!

936
01:30:00,260 --> 01:30:02,888
I'm holding it, I'm holding it!

937
01:30:03,062 --> 01:30:05,462
What can you do if
you can't see what's happening?

938
01:30:10,436 --> 01:30:13,564
- Hold on!
- Oh, my God!

939
01:31:22,475 --> 01:31:24,943
You can't leave us!

940
01:31:29,649 --> 01:31:33,949
So he is a coward after all.

941
01:31:34,354 --> 01:31:35,878
He's gone.

942
01:31:36,055 --> 01:31:37,579
Come back, Superman!

943
01:31:42,662 --> 01:31:44,323
Don't leave us!

944
01:31:47,233 --> 01:31:49,224
He chickened out.

945
01:31:49,736 --> 01:31:50,794
Phony!

946
01:31:52,138 --> 01:31:54,072
Superman didn't even do nothing.

947
01:31:54,340 --> 01:31:56,467
Come on, let's go.

948
01:32:03,483 --> 01:32:07,283
- There they are.
- Get away from here. Jimmy.

949
01:32:16,296 --> 01:32:18,127
Our victory is complete.

950
01:32:18,298 --> 01:32:20,061
The son of Jor-El has fled.

951
01:32:20,233 --> 01:32:22,929
- Superman fled?
- I don't believe you.

952
01:32:23,102 --> 01:32:27,163
You heard him. Three against one,
you should've taken two ears and a tail.

953
01:32:27,340 --> 01:32:30,434
- He fled in fear of us.
- He'll be back.

954
01:32:30,610 --> 01:32:32,976
As long as he's alive,
he's gonna try again.

955
01:32:33,146 --> 01:32:36,582
- The next time, we will kill him.
- The next time?

956
01:32:37,617 --> 01:32:39,676
The next time?

957
01:32:40,420 --> 01:32:42,513
What am I gonna do with you people?

958
01:32:42,689 --> 01:32:45,283
I held up my end.
I delivered you the blue boy.

959
01:32:45,458 --> 01:32:47,756
What do I get from my triple threat?

960
01:32:47,927 --> 01:32:52,261
"Bow, yield, kneel."
That kind of stuff closes out a town.

961
01:32:53,833 --> 01:32:57,633
Why do you say this to me
when you know I will kill you for it?

962
01:32:57,837 --> 01:33:01,637
Kill me? Lex Luthor?

963
01:33:02,075 --> 01:33:04,839
Extinguish the greatest
criminal flame of our age?

964
01:33:05,011 --> 01:33:09,141
- Eradicate the only man on earth with...
- Let me kill him!

965
01:33:09,615 --> 01:33:11,207
- Superman's address?

966
01:33:15,088 --> 01:33:20,424
What more do you want?
I can see the greed written on your face.

967
01:33:20,593 --> 01:33:23,460
A small incentive, O Fullest One.

968
01:33:23,629 --> 01:33:26,655
A mere bauble to jog the memory.

969
01:33:27,266 --> 01:33:28,460
What more?

970
01:33:29,435 --> 01:33:30,629
Cuba.

971
01:33:38,644 --> 01:33:44,879
I trust you are not wasting my time,
Lex Luthor.

972
01:33:45,084 --> 01:33:47,314
Of course not, Your Turbulence.

973
01:34:33,499 --> 01:34:35,592
Show yourself, coward!

974
01:34:38,504 --> 01:34:40,699
Son of a coward!

975
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:48,377
I'm here, Zod.

976
01:34:48,781 --> 01:34:51,807
- Let Miss Lane go, step inside. We'll talk.
- No, don't, Superman!

977
01:34:51,984 --> 01:34:53,952
Please don't listen to him. He's just...

978
01:34:54,387 --> 01:34:55,649
Stop.

979
01:34:55,822 --> 01:34:57,813
Your powers are identical to mine.

980
01:34:57,990 --> 01:35:01,221
But we are three.
We could tear you limb from limb.

981
01:35:01,527 --> 01:35:02,755
Do it, Your Grace.

982
01:35:03,129 --> 01:35:05,290
Just grab a leg and just make a wish.

983
01:35:06,799 --> 01:35:09,199
But you are victim
to another fatal weakness...

984
01:35:09,635 --> 01:35:11,068
...your compassión.

985
01:35:11,237 --> 01:35:13,705
The death of others
means more to you than your own.

986
01:35:13,873 --> 01:35:15,340
Yes, with rare exceptions.

987
01:35:15,775 --> 01:35:21,304
Your father condemned us to an eternal
living death. Your fate will be the same.

988
01:35:21,581 --> 01:35:23,640
You will live, Kal-EI, forever...

989
01:35:23,816 --> 01:35:28,810
...as my slave. If not, then others
will pay for your obstinate attitude.

990
01:35:28,988 --> 01:35:34,517
Innocent people, millions if necessary,
beginning with this Lois person.

991
01:35:34,694 --> 01:35:36,321
- Don't, Superman, don't!
- Stop it!

992
01:35:40,533 --> 01:35:42,763
All right, Zod.

993
01:35:43,436 --> 01:35:44,869
It's over.

994
01:35:47,707 --> 01:35:51,473
Your Grace, don't believe him!
You don't know him the way that I do.

995
01:35:53,679 --> 01:35:55,874
I sense the presence of Jor-El here.

996
01:35:57,884 --> 01:35:59,749
We will destroy this place.

997
01:36:00,253 --> 01:36:01,652
And then kill him.

998
01:36:03,956 --> 01:36:05,821
Him.

999
01:36:06,993 --> 01:36:09,928
Him? Me?

1000
01:36:11,330 --> 01:36:13,264
General, this is Lex Luthor.

1001
01:36:13,933 --> 01:36:17,494
Remember...?
I helped you through the tough times.

1002
01:36:17,670 --> 01:36:19,535
I filled your inside straight.

1003
01:36:20,072 --> 01:36:24,133
You came to me with nothing.
I gave you Superman.

1004
01:36:24,310 --> 01:36:25,777
Silence!

1005
01:36:25,945 --> 01:36:27,537
Well, look...

1006
01:36:30,049 --> 01:36:31,573
Guy's a clod.

1007
01:36:32,185 --> 01:36:34,244
You think you know people, right?

1008
01:36:34,854 --> 01:36:37,982
Promises were made,
gifts were exchanged.

1009
01:36:38,157 --> 01:36:41,558
I gotta hand it to you, you know.
You always told the truth.

1010
01:36:41,761 --> 01:36:44,559
A guy always knew
where he stood with you.

1011
01:36:46,666 --> 01:36:49,533
Try to get them all
into this molecule chamber here.

1012
01:36:49,702 --> 01:36:51,829
It takes away their powers, see...

1013
01:36:52,004 --> 01:36:54,598
...and turns them into
ordinary human beings.

1014
01:36:54,774 --> 01:36:55,968
Now, if you could...

1015
01:36:59,145 --> 01:37:02,342
- Don't go in there. It's a trap.
- Luthor, you poisonous snake!

1016
01:37:02,715 --> 01:37:04,205
That's a molecule chamber.

1017
01:37:04,417 --> 01:37:08,251
It makes people like
you into people like me.

1018
01:37:08,688 --> 01:37:10,883
- You've done well, Lex Luthor.
- I thought so.

1019
01:37:12,091 --> 01:37:13,683
Seize him.

1020
01:37:15,361 --> 01:37:17,488
- Kill her.
- No! Superman, no!

1021
01:37:17,663 --> 01:37:19,790
All right! All right, leave her alone, Zod!

1022
01:37:20,333 --> 01:37:21,994
You win.

1023
01:37:25,204 --> 01:37:29,766
General, the crystal there
activates the mechanism.

1024
01:37:29,942 --> 01:37:32,775
Lex Luthor, ruler of Australia...

1025
01:37:32,945 --> 01:37:34,640
...activate the machine.

1026
01:37:45,825 --> 01:37:47,816
With your permissión.

1027
01:39:00,966 --> 01:39:03,833
And now, finally...

1028
01:39:08,074 --> 01:39:09,701
Kneel.

1029
01:39:14,213 --> 01:39:16,613
Take my hand...

1030
01:39:16,816 --> 01:39:22,584
...and swear eternal loyalty to Zod.

1031
01:40:02,661 --> 01:40:04,026
He switched it.

1032
01:40:04,663 --> 01:40:06,597
He did it to them.

1033
01:40:07,333 --> 01:40:12,737
The lights were on out here
while he was safe in there.

1034
01:40:14,106 --> 01:40:16,097
Hey, you know something?

1035
01:40:16,442 --> 01:40:18,569
You're a real pain in the neck!

1036
01:40:28,521 --> 01:40:30,318
Are you all right?

1037
01:40:31,490 --> 01:40:35,221
I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor.
A lying weasel like you couldn't resist.

1038
01:40:35,694 --> 01:40:37,559
Who, me? Are you kidding?

1039
01:40:37,730 --> 01:40:41,791
Hey, I was with you all the
time. That was beautiful.

1040
01:40:41,967 --> 01:40:44,128
Did you see the way
they fell into our trap?

1041
01:40:44,370 --> 01:40:46,804
Too late, Luthor. Too late.

1042
01:40:47,072 --> 01:40:50,269
Look. Look, Superman.

1043
01:40:50,709 --> 01:40:52,677
I got a proposition for you.

1044
01:40:52,845 --> 01:40:55,177
Now, don't stop me
till you've heard this...

1045
01:40:55,347 --> 01:40:58,612
...because I know I owe you one,
but we're in the North Pole, right?

1046
01:42:15,828 --> 01:42:17,386
Look, Lois...

1047
01:42:18,531 --> 01:42:20,829
No regrets, okay? I did it.

1048
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,594
I got the man I loved to love me.

1049
01:42:26,505 --> 01:42:30,168
- Didn't I?
- Oh, yeah.

1050
01:42:32,344 --> 01:42:35,074
Well, okay then. Those people need you.

1051
01:42:35,247 --> 01:42:37,647
Do you think I don't understand that?

1052
01:42:42,121 --> 01:42:46,524
We can still see each other, you know.
I mean, all the time.

1053
01:42:48,894 --> 01:42:51,158
But it just can't be...

1054
01:43:13,619 --> 01:43:15,849
Just don't forget, that's all.

1055
01:43:16,689 --> 01:43:18,054
Don't ever forget.

1056
01:43:42,548 --> 01:43:45,711
- Well, here we are.
- Home sweet home.

1057
01:43:46,919 --> 01:43:50,377
- See you at work in the morning.
- Bright and early, huh?

1058
01:43:50,556 --> 01:43:54,458
- The same old Clark and the same old Lois.
- Yup.

1059
01:43:55,260 --> 01:44:00,288
Except... maybe I won't be
quite so mean to you from now on.

1060
01:44:07,973 --> 01:44:09,235
You don't have to worry.

1061
01:44:09,808 --> 01:44:11,400
Your secret's safe with me.

1062
01:44:12,678 --> 01:44:16,239
I know. I know that, Lois.

1063
01:44:41,473 --> 01:44:43,873
Well, there he goes, kid.

1064
01:44:44,810 --> 01:44:46,778
Up, up and away.

1065
01:46:12,231 --> 01:46:15,029
- No!
- No!

1066
01:46:42,394 --> 01:46:44,521
- Hey, is Mr. White free?
- On the telephone.

1067
01:46:44,696 --> 01:46:48,632
- He's in conference at the moment.
- Yeah, that's what he says.

1068
01:47:04,983 --> 01:47:07,178
All right, give me three carbons of that.

1069
01:47:07,352 --> 01:47:09,684
- Hi.
- It's gonna be an insert in the paper.

1070
01:47:09,855 --> 01:47:11,584
That's what they said.

1071
01:47:13,125 --> 01:47:15,593
Good morning. Hi.

1072
01:47:21,266 --> 01:47:22,893
Good morning, Lois.

1073
01:47:28,607 --> 01:47:30,438
- Good morning, Lois.
- Hi, Clark.

1074
01:47:30,609 --> 01:47:33,339
Jeepers, I have seen
some faraway looks in my time...

1075
01:47:33,512 --> 01:47:36,743
...but with that look, you might as well
be on the North Pole.

1076
01:47:37,716 --> 01:47:39,911
The North Pole.

1077
01:47:41,119 --> 01:47:42,711
No, that's too silly.

1078
01:47:43,689 --> 01:47:49,286
Did you ever feel like you knew something
that was so important that...

1079
01:47:49,628 --> 01:47:51,459
No, you never did.

1080
01:47:52,264 --> 01:47:57,964
I mean, I feel like I'm sitting on the single
most important story of my career...

1081
01:47:58,136 --> 01:48:00,229
...and I can't remember what it is.

1082
01:48:00,772 --> 01:48:04,367
Well, knowing you,
it must have been about Superman.

1083
01:48:04,543 --> 01:48:07,808
Maybe how he saved the city or
saved the worid or saved the universe.

1084
01:48:07,980 --> 01:48:11,916
Clark, Clark. Listen.
Jealousy's really counterproductive.

1085
01:48:12,084 --> 01:48:14,780
Now, there's some things
that you can do too.

1086
01:48:15,787 --> 01:48:17,379
Oh, yeah?

1087
01:48:17,556 --> 01:48:20,320
Really? Like what?

1088
01:48:21,827 --> 01:48:23,021
Get us a pizza.

1089
01:48:23,795 --> 01:48:27,526
- A pizza. Now?
- Yeah, I'm hungry.

1090
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,525
Actually, I don't think
Mr. White would like it if...

1091
01:48:30,702 --> 01:48:32,636
I'll pay for half of it, all right?

1092
01:48:32,804 --> 01:48:34,237
I'm going.

1093
01:48:39,411 --> 01:48:40,844
Lois?

1094
01:48:41,313 --> 01:48:42,610
You know, about the pizza?

1095
01:48:43,882 --> 01:48:47,318
It's okay. I'll pay for the whole thing.

1096
01:48:49,521 --> 01:48:51,512
You know, you're really super.

1097
01:49:13,211 --> 01:49:15,611
- Hey, Ron.
- Yeah?

1098
01:49:15,781 --> 01:49:17,578
Give me another
plate of this garbage.

1099
01:49:17,749 --> 01:49:20,513
Garbage? That's my
number-one special, Rocky.

1100
01:49:20,719 --> 01:49:24,348
All right. Get me some
more coffee too, will you?

1101
01:49:25,657 --> 01:49:29,991
Gee, that's funny. I've never
seen garbage eat garbage before.

1102
01:49:38,036 --> 01:49:41,938
Excuse me, sir. I think
you're sitting in my favorite seat.

1103
01:49:42,107 --> 01:49:43,438
Come and get it, four-eyes.

1104
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:49,843
Now cool it, Rocky.

1105
01:49:51,016 --> 01:49:52,142
Take it easy, will you?

1106
01:49:52,317 --> 01:49:55,753
I just had this joint fixed.
It cost me a fortune.

1107
01:50:12,371 --> 01:50:14,464
Oh, God!

1108
01:50:26,184 --> 01:50:28,311
This order's to go.

1109
01:50:36,061 --> 01:50:39,929
I'm terribly sorry
about all the damage, sir.

1110
01:50:42,300 --> 01:50:46,202
I've been working out.

1111
01:55:46,271 --> 01:55:48,262
