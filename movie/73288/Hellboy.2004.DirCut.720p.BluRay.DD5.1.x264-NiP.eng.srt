1
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:02,288
What is it that makes a man a man?

2
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:06,087
Is it his origins,
the way things start?

3
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,429
Or is it something else,
something harder to describe?

4
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:14,331
For me, it all began in 1944.

5
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:17,738
Classified mission
off the coast of Scotland.

6
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,303
The Nazis were desperate.

7
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,948
Combining science and black magic...

8
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:26,517
...they intended to upset
the balance of the war.

9
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,153
I was 28, already a paranormal
advisor to President Roosevelt.

10
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:36,885
I could never have suspected
that what would transpire that night...

11
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:40,089
...would not only affect
the course of history...

12
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,962
...but change my life forever.

13
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:44,694
All right, men, let's go. Move!

14
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:52,873
Come on! Come on! Come on!

15
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,175
Let's fan it out.

16
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,686
Your men...

17
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,790
...they'll need these.

18
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,025
Are you a Catholic?

19
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:12,631
Yes. Among other things.
But that's hardly the point.

20
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,664
Well, you're gonna need
one of these.

21
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,230
l abhor the use of violence.

22
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:21,069
Thank you. l wouldn't want you
to think me mad, Sergeant Whitman.

23
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,801
No, three days too late for that,
Professor Broom.

24
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:27,140
All right, you guys,
let's move, move, move, move!

25
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:33,885
Come on boys, let's go!

26
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,577
This way! Left, right!

27
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,723
Come on, men, let's get the lead out!

28
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:38,880
We're close!

29
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:42,391
You're wasting our time. There's
nothing here but sheep and rocks.

30
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,496
-Ruins, not rocks.
-Hold it right here!

31
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:48,122
The remains of Trondham Abbey,
built on an intersection of ley lines...

32
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,394
...the boundaries between
our world and the others--

33
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,504
What a load of crap!

34
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,902
Hell, a week ago, l never even heard
the word ''parabnormal.''

35
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:57,372
Paranormal.

36
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,136
Move it!

37
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,911
Hold the line.

38
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:03,775
Come on!

39
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,480
Sweet Jesus.

40
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,626
They must be here for the sheep.

41
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:38,339
The freak in the gas mask....

42
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,986
Karl Ruprecht Kroenen.

43
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:46,453
Hitler's top assassin
and head of the Thule Occult Society.

44
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:50,728
lf he's here, this is worse
than l thought.

45
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:18,018
No matter what happens tonight...

46
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:21,183
...this book will guide you
back to me.

47
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,352
l will not leave you.

48
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:28,361
l grant you everlasting life...

49
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,727
...youth...

50
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:32,996
...and the power to serve me.

51
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,306
llsa! Grigori!

52
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,033
lt's time.

53
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:53,091
Five years of research
and construction, Grigori.

54
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,556
Five years!

55
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:57,059
The fuhrer doesn't look kindly
on failure.

56
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,926
There will be no failure, general.

57
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,030
l promised Herr Hitler a miracle.

58
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:08,099
l'll deliver one.

59
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,052
What l will do tonight
can never be undone!

60
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,020
What l will do tonight
can never be undone!

61
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:23,280
l will open a portal...

62
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,315
...and awaken the Ogdru Jahad:

63
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,188
The Seven Gods of Chaos!

64
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,460
Our enemies will be destroyed!

65
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,793
And from the ashes...

66
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:39,334
...a new Eden will arise.

67
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:05,718
Get down!

68
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,088
l was taking a picture.

69
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,891
You do that again
and l'll carve you a new one.

70
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:15,295
Listen, the portal is open.

71
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:18,528
Do you understand?
We have to stop them.

72
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:51,736
Go! Go! Go! Go!

73
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,485
Look out!

74
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,493
Get down!

75
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,232
lt's almost over.

76
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,877
No, it's not.

77
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,373
The portal's been open for too long.

78
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,710
Something may have come through.

79
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:48,877
Have your men search
the area thoroughly.

80
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,222
Spread out over that way!

81
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:00,694
Sir! Something up here!

82
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,364
He's gone.

83
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,505
For now.

84
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:11,701
When you said something
came through....

85
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,943
From where?

86
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,616
l don't see them!

87
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:31,024
Do you really, really believe in hell?

88
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,465
There is a place,
a dark place...

89
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:39,662
...where ancient evil slumbers
and waits to return.

90
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,002
-Grigori gave us a glance tonight.
-Grigori?

91
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:45,776
That's Russian, right?

92
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,277
Grigori Efimovich Rasputin.

93
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,539
Rasputin?

94
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:53,151
-Come on!
-Occult adviser to the Romanovs.

95
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,117
ln 1 91 6, at a dinner in his honor...

96
00:10:56,288 --> 00:11:01,191
...he was poisoned, shot,
stabbed, clubbed...

97
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:04,386
...castrated and finally drowned.

98
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:07,964
And yet, we saw him here tonight.

99
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,192
Professor Broom.

100
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,137
Careful. Be careful.

101
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:41,591
-What the hell is that? An ape?
-No.

102
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:44,292
lt was red. Bright red.

103
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,438
Lower your light, you're scaring it.

104
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:50,270
-What are you two shooting at?
-A red ape!

105
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,968
No, it's not an ape.

106
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,978
lt's got a big stone in its hand.

107
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:59,049
l think that is its hand.

108
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,448
Look at the size of that whammer.

109
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:06,422
No, wait! Wait!

110
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:41,492
A blanket. Get me a blanket.

111
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,628
Come on. Come on. lt's safe.

112
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:49,958
Jump down.

113
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,400
Come on. Jump down.

114
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,737
lt's a boy.

115
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,845
lt's just a baby boy.

116
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,080
Move to the left.

117
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:15,523
There we were, an unready father
for an unwanted child.

118
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:19,193
The boys gave him a name
that very night.

119
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:22,630
In retrospect,
perhaps not the most fortunate.

120
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,568
But nevertheless,
a name we all came to use.

121
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:30,208
We called him Hellboy.

122
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,712
Look at the birdie.

123
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,887
Speculation about the origins....

124
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,396
Evidence that Hellboy....

125
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,776
So, what is it exactly
that you say this agency does?

126
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,248
I kid you not. It hunts monsters.

127
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,357
The claim, of course,
that this creature...

128
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,693
...works for the FBI
as a monster hunter.

129
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,339
What you seek is in there.

130
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,656
This is a sacred place.

131
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,496
Give me my gold.

132
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:14,932
We shouldn't be here.

133
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:12,896
Master.

134
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,093
Your eyes.

135
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,970
What did they do to your eyes?

136
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:30,348
-Have you told him yet?
-No.

137
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,576
We should.

138
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,228
Malignant sarcoma.

139
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,657
ln the lungs...

140
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,730
...the spine...

141
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,700
-...liver.
-Approximately...

142
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:57,270
-...how long?
-Maybe six weeks.

143
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:02,403
l can arrange for hospitalization
and pain management.

144
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:06,779
-Make the time more bearable.
-No.

145
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:09,250
l'd rather be at home.

146
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:13,121
l have some arrangements to make.

147
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,655
For my son.

148
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,625
You can always get
a second opinion.

149
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:26,126
That won't be necessary.

150
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,634
Hurry up!

151
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,413
-Hurry up!
-Wait right here!

152
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:39,975
Tom Manning is the head
of special operations at the FBI.

153
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:43,883
He joins Pat in the studio tonight
to go over the latest Hellboy sighting.

154
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,889
There. That's the tail.

155
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,050
And these are the horns.

156
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,354
l have a question.

157
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:56,593
ln the pictures of aliens, UFO,
the yeti, Hellboy...

158
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:59,566
...why is it they're always out of focus?

159
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:01,665
Why don't you tell us...

160
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,775
...about the Bureau of Paranormal
Research and Defense?

161
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:08,003
l wanna tell you, l wanna tell
the American public one thing.

162
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,841
Now, this Bureau for the....

163
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:13,109
Paranormal Research and Defense.

164
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,623
There is no such thing.

165
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,740
''Waste Management Services''?

166
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:41,506
What is it?

167
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:44,709
John Myers, FBl.

168
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,078
Transfer from Quantico.

169
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,547
Look at the birdie, son.

170
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:15,608
-Hello. l'm John--
-You are late. That's what you are.

171
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,274
-Five minutes.
-Yes, l know.

172
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:22,682
-l'm going to--
-Section 51 . l know.

173
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:25,248
Watch your hands and elbows.

174
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,915
-Pardon?
-Watch your hands and elbows.

175
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:56,882
Hello?

176
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,492
Turn the pages, please,
if you don't mind.

177
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,771
Please.

178
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,773
The pages.

179
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,775
These? You're reading these?

180
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,776
Four books at once, every day...

181
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,278
Four books at once, every day...

182
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:19,778
Four books at once, every day...

183
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,781
...as long as l'm there
to turn the pages.

184
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:23,782
My name's Broom.

185
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:24,650
My name's Broom.

186
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,411
Professor Trevor Broom.

187
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:27,574
Sir, l'm John--

188
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:30,119
Agent John T. Myers,
Kansas City, '76.

189
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,587
T stands for Thaddeus,
mother's older brother.

190
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,953
Scar on your chin happened
when you were 1 0.

191
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,960
You still wonder if it's ever
going to fade away.

192
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,893
-How did it--?
-He.

193
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,194
Not ''it.''

194
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,393
Abraham Sapien.

195
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:49,131
Discovered alive
in a secret chamber...

196
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,141
...of St. Trinian's
Foundling Hospital, Washington.

197
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,438
His name was taken
from this inscription...

198
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:57,207
-...stuck to the side of his tank.
-''lcthyo Sapiens.

199
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,942
April 1 4, 1 865.''

200
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:02,914
The day that Abraham Lincoln died.

201
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:05,487
Hence, Abe Sapien.

202
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:08,189
Rotten eggs.

203
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:11,893
A delicacy. Abe loves them.

204
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:14,157
How does he know
so much about me?

205
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,564
Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.

206
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:23,271
''Unique.'' That's a word you'll hear
frequently around here.

207
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,976
Sir, where am l, exactly?

208
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:32,678
As you entered the lobby,
there was an inscription:

209
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:37,447
''ln the absence of light,
darkness prevails.''

210
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:41,023
There are things that go bump
in the night, Agent Myers.

211
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,785
Make no mistake about that.

212
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:47,359
And we are the ones
who bump back.

213
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:54,868
1 93 7, Hitler joins
the Thule Society...

214
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:58,770
...a group of German aristocrats
obsessed with the occult.

215
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:03,313
1 938, he acquired
the Spear of Longinus...

216
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:05,313
...which pierced the side of Christ.

217
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:07,577
He who holds it becomes invincible.

218
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:10,620
Hitler's power increases tenfold.

219
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:14,589
1 943, President Roosevelt
decides to fight back.

220
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:17,887
The Bureau of Paranormal
Research and Defense is born.

221
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,563
1 958, the Occult Wars
finally come to an end...

222
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,224
...with the death of Adolf Hitler.

223
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,565
1 945, you mean.

224
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,396
Hitler died in '45.

225
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:32,107
Did he, now?

226
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:37,576
Myers, this is Agent Clay.

227
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,114
Take his lead.

228
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,283
He'll make the introductions.

229
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,015
You're not coming?

230
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:52,829
l handpicked you from a roster of over
70 academy graduates.

231
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,590
Make me proud.

232
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,598
They're not speaking.

233
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:00,236
Professor Broom had him grounded.

234
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:02,737
Grounded? Who's grounded?

235
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:14,408
Okay. You saw the fish guy, right?

236
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,747
Oh, yeah. That was weird.

237
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:18,622
Yeah. Right.

238
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:29,230
Well, come on in.
Meet the rest of the family.

239
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:31,635
He gets fed six times a day.

240
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,327
He's got a thing for cats.

241
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:36,440
You'll be his nanny,
his keeper, his best friend.

242
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:39,274
He never goes out unsupervised.

243
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:40,433
Who?

244
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,247
l hate those comic books.

245
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,449
They never get the eyes right.

246
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:58,953
Hellboy.

247
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:00,753
He's real.

248
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:04,368
60 years old by our count.
But he doesn't age like we do.

249
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:07,903
Think reverse dog years.
He's barely out of his 20s.

250
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:09,472
What's with the hair, Clay?

251
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:11,804
Finally got them implants, huh?

252
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,979
lt'll fill in.

253
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:16,641
Who's the squirt?

254
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,644
Agent Myers is your new liaison.

255
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:23,984
l don't want him.

256
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:27,317
What, you get tired of me, Clay?

257
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:29,860
The candy. Give him the candy.

258
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,121
Oh, sir, l....

259
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,128
l have these for you.

260
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:36,660
Father's back?

261
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:41,429
-He still angry?
-Well, you did break out.

262
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:42,800
l wanted to see her.

263
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:46,802
-Nobody's business.
-lt is. You got yourself on TV again.

264
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:48,806
Myers, huh?

265
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,546
You got a first name, Myers?

266
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:54,446
Try not to stare.
He hates it when people stare.

267
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,022
John. John Myers.

268
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:00,123
Well, John'll do.

269
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:04,456
-Stare at what?
-His horns. He files them to fit in.

270
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:14,369
What you looking at, John?

271
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:19,739
Oh, no, no, no. Nothing.
Nothing at all.

272
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,242
Code red.

273
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,402
Hey, hey, hey.

274
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,912
Warning. Code red.

275
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,447
They're playing our song.

276
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:29,183
Come on, champ,
let's go fight some monsters.

277
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,395
We're here at the Machen Library...

278
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:40,326
...where just hours ago,
an alarm was triggered.

279
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:43,433
The N.Y.P.D. has yet
to issue a statement.

280
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:47,038
We've got SWAT vans, paramedics.
You name it.

281
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:49,298
And now here comes
a garbage truck.

282
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,465
A large garbage truck.

283
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,538
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue.

284
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:59,343
One sheet of glass
between them and us.

285
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:01,314
Story of my life.

286
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,946
Outside.
l could be outside.

287
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,022
You mean, outside with her.

288
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,459
Don't get psychic with me, fella.

289
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,496
Nothing psychic about it.

290
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:16,163
You're easy.

291
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:19,303
How am l gonna get a girl?
l drive around in a garbage truck.

292
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:22,739
Liz left us, Red.

293
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,675
Take the hint.

294
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:26,743
We don't take hints.

295
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:38,189
Civilians in bedroom.

296
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:02,569
Okay, guys,
let's sync up our locators.

297
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:10,152
Seal the doors.
Red and Blue are coming in.

298
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,453
1 900 hours, an alarm was tripped.

299
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:17,061
A large entity, type 5, reported.
Very aggressive.

300
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:18,388
Six guards dead.

301
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:20,360
l thought we checked this place.

302
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,999
Fakes and reproductions.

303
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,965
Apparently, not everything was fake.

304
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,204
Father.

305
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:38,242
The entity is still in there.

306
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:43,319
Video surveillance shows
a 1 6th-century statue was destroyed.

307
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:45,680
St. Dionysius the Areopagite.

308
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:48,621
-Who wards off demons.
-Exactly.

309
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:53,061
The statue, however, was hollow.

310
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,331
A reliquary.

311
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,265
A prison.

312
00:28:57,435 --> 00:29:00,666
The Vatican deemed its occupant
dangerous enough...

313
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:05,435
...to include it on The List of Avignon,
of which, by the way, we hold a copy.

314
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,874
Perfect job for these babies.

315
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,603
Made them myself.

316
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:14,246
Holy water, clove leaf, silver
shavings, white oak. The works.

317
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,923
Behind this door, a dark entity.

318
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:26,493
Evil, ancient and hungry.

319
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:30,532
Oh, well.
Let me go in and say hi.

320
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:01,798
You better hit the books,
Brother Blue.

321
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,992
We'll definitely need
more info on this one.

322
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,331
Hey, no one goes with him? Jesus.

323
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:09,871
No. He likes it that way.

324
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:13,408
The whole ''lonely hero'' thing.

325
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,324
Hey, Stinky.

326
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:34,424
Kitchen's closed.

327
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:36,556
What you having?

328
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:40,228
Six library guards, raw,
plus belts and boots.

329
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:44,569
Man, you're gonna need
some heavy fiber to move that out.

330
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:46,607
Red, I found something.

331
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:49,809
This entity's name is Sammael,
the desolate one.

332
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:51,710
Son of Nergal, brother of--

333
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,754
Listen, Sammy...

334
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:11,292
...l'm not a very good shot, but The
Samaritan here uses really big bullets.

335
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:23,812
So, what do you say we work this out
in a nice, peaceful....

336
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,649
Oh, crap.

337
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:41,161
That's it for you, Sam.

338
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:46,297
Red, you need to hear
the rest of the information.

339
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,731
No, he's taken care of.

340
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,841
No, listen to this.

341
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:55,210
''Sammael, the desolate one,
lord of the shadows...

342
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,315
...son of Nergal,
hound of resurrection.... ''

343
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:03,082
See...

344
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,551
...l don't like that.

345
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:06,553
What? Hound of resurrection?

346
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:10,186
''Harbinger of pestilence.
Seed of destruc--''

347
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:12,727
Cut to the end. How do l kill it?

348
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:14,262
Doesn't say.

349
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:22,032
Go to the front. Let's go! Move!

350
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:23,833
l'm going around the back.

351
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,226
Oh, crap.

352
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,196
Child.

353
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,668
All grown up, l see.

354
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,569
That voice.

355
00:32:57,275 --> 00:33:00,369
lt was the first lullaby
you ever heard, my son.

356
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:03,070
l ushered you into this world.

357
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:07,013
l alone know your true calling,
your true name.

358
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:09,084
Name this.

359
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:31,773
-That thing. That thing.
-What do you think you're doing?

360
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:34,503
-What do you think you're doing?
-Helping you. l--

361
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,271
Nobody helps me!

362
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:37,880
lt's my job.

363
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:44,547
You want to help? Here.
Load this.

364
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,694
lt's a tracking bullet. Crack the pin.

365
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,699
Jesus, what's that on your arm?

366
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,200
Oh, crap.

367
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:03,804
What the hell is that thing?

368
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:05,899
Let me go ask.

369
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:29,429
All right, keep coming.
Good. Keep coming.

370
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:35,469
Why, you little....

371
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,654
Wait!

372
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,793
We're heading toward civilians.

373
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:15,674
Crazy costumes, huh?
Trick or treat.

374
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:46,608
Red means stop!

375
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:02,017
-You all right?
-Yeah.

376
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:04,286
Stay here.

377
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:18,542
Sammy, you got a leak.

378
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:27,778
Waiting for me, chunk-face?

379
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:34,947
What the--?

380
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,655
-l'm on your side.
-Sure.

381
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:19,968
That's right!

382
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,323
Open wide!

383
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:50,055
Son of a--

384
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:55,864
Yuck!

385
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,871
Screw this.

386
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,087
l'm fireproof.

387
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:16,860
You're not.

388
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:25,758
Hey, Myers.

389
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:28,199
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?

390
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:30,033
How's your arm?

391
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:33,267
Yeah, my arm's fine.
Where are you?

392
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:35,412
l just fried Stinky.

393
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:37,240
Listen...

394
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:39,039
...tell Father l'll be home...

395
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:40,649
...but he shouldn't wait up.

396
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,217
No. No, wait, wait.

397
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:43,819
Yeah, I gotta go with you.

398
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,548
-Hey, Myers.
-Yeah?

399
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:50,355
Bye.

400
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,392
Damn it.

401
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:11,105
Sammael has fulfilled his destiny.

402
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,903
Die in peace...

403
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:17,514
...and be reborn again and again.

404
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:25,951
Only seven more days
till the eclipse.

405
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:30,253
The child will be there,
and so will we all.

406
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,323
Won't we?

407
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:23,910
There's a big, red man down there.

408
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:26,948
That's fine, darling.
Santa's not here for another month.

409
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:28,880
Not Santa.

410
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:30,816
Well, who, then?

411
00:41:41,865 --> 00:41:43,628
l brought beer.

412
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,935
Oh, Red, your arm.

413
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:49,629
You better get that looked at.

414
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:58,309
l wanted to see you.

415
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:26,576
Every time the media gets
a look at him, they run to me.

416
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:28,336
l'm running out of lies, Trevor.

417
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:31,072
-l thought you like being on TV.
-l do.

418
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:34,943
So how many escapes
this year alone? Five.

419
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,349
Tom, he's our guest, not a prisoner.

420
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:41,753
Your guest is 6-foot-5, bright red,
has a tail and is government-funded.

421
00:42:41,925 --> 00:42:43,290
l know where to find him.

422
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:46,423
-l'll get him back.
-Hey, fish stick.

423
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,890
Don't touch anything.

424
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:50,260
l need to touch it to see.

425
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:53,562
-See what?
-Past, future.

426
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:57,100
Whatever this object holds.

427
00:42:57,274 --> 00:42:58,400
ls he serious?

428
00:42:58,575 --> 00:43:01,544
Don't worry about fingerprints.
Never had any.

429
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:06,648
Professor, they were here.

430
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:13,345
Who was here? Nixon? Houdini?

431
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:15,424
Jimmy Hoffa? Who?

432
00:43:15,592 --> 00:43:19,255
Show me, Abe.
Show me what happened here.

433
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:36,839
This is east-wing check-in.
We're all clear.

434
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:42,042
Also, make sure it's all locked up
over there in the annex.

435
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,344
Roger that.

436
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:12,909
Kroenen!

437
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:15,044
Move.

438
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,226
Move!

439
00:44:32,736 --> 00:44:33,896
There he is!

440
00:44:42,412 --> 00:44:44,243
We'll cover him from here!

441
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:48,683
All right, don't move! Put that down.

442
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:50,713
Put down the weapon!

443
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:52,077
Get them.

444
00:44:52,256 --> 00:44:53,848
Drop the weapon.

445
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:57,853
On the ground!

446
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:03,890
Last warning!

447
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,534
Take him out!

448
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:41,571
Now, ready the welcome, my love.

449
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:52,243
Salt gathered from the tears
of a thousand angels.

450
00:45:52,749 --> 00:45:54,740
Restraining the essence...

451
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:58,149
...of Sammael, the hellhound.

452
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:02,456
The seed of destruction.

453
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:16,031
This l can promise, Sammael.

454
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,134
For each one of you that falls...

455
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:21,800
...two shall arise.

456
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,512
-Professor.
-l'm all right.

457
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:02,949
Professor.

458
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:07,584
You....

459
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,324
You are very sick.

460
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:15,723
l don't want Hellboy to know.

461
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:21,326
Sixty years ago,
they tried to destroy the world.

462
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,029
They're back.

463
00:47:23,573 --> 00:47:27,168
ln my lifetime, they're back...

464
00:47:27,544 --> 00:47:30,274
...to finish the job.

465
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,011
We miss you at the bureau.

466
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,449
Abe's crazier every day.

467
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:39,851
Father's still mad at me.

468
00:47:44,094 --> 00:47:45,891
Come back, Liz.

469
00:47:46,063 --> 00:47:48,793
-Come back.
-No. No, H.B.

470
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:52,197
No, not this time.

471
00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:56,401
l don't like it here...

472
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,801
...but l haven't had an episode
in months.

473
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,578
And you know what?

474
00:48:07,517 --> 00:48:09,883
l'm learning to control it.

475
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:13,521
l'm learning where it comes from.

476
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:17,350
For the first time in my life...

477
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:20,588
...l'm not afraid.

478
00:48:28,271 --> 00:48:31,502
-Looks like your ride is here.
-Have escort stand by.

479
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:36,637
The Nanny Squad.

480
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:39,512
Hey, stop. Wait. Wait.

481
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:43,148
Sir, may l go first?

482
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,015
Hang on a minute.

483
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:46,655
He barely knows him.

484
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:50,816
Then he should make it his business
to change that.

485
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:56,732
Listen, H.B...

486
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,391
...l've got a chance out here.

487
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:02,332
So if you really care about me...

488
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:08,404
...you won't come back.

489
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:21,122
Yeah...

490
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:22,989
...l gotta go too.

491
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:26,925
Lots to do.

492
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:37,136
What took you so long?

493
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:42,911
Come on, time to go home.

494
00:49:43,346 --> 00:49:45,177
Tape you up.

495
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:50,144
What are you, a Boy Scout?

496
00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:55,186
-Nope, l never was.
-Well, you could have fooled me.

497
00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:58,158
Hey, Red.

498
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:01,156
Oh, God. You've lost a lot of blood.

499
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:02,764
This is nothing.

500
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:05,527
You know what'll kill me, don't you?

501
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,971
Okay, Red, let's get you home.
Come on.

502
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:32,588
You were burned
by some organic acid.

503
00:50:32,762 --> 00:50:34,423
l'm lucky that way.

504
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:38,795
-l worry about you.
-Me?

505
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:42,633
Well...

506
00:50:44,307 --> 00:50:46,298
...l won't be around forever,
you know.

507
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:47,568
Damn!

508
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:50,936
Could you please be a little careful?

509
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:52,442
Big baby.

510
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:55,517
How long was it latched onto you?

511
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,354
l don't know. About five seconds.

512
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:02,981
-Professor, look.
-ls it bad?

513
00:51:03,793 --> 00:51:07,786
Touched you five seconds,
laid three eggs.

514
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:09,966
Didn't even buy me a drink.

515
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:19,070
The stinger detaches itself from
the tongue and injects the eggs.

516
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:23,110
They are very sensitive
to heat and light.

517
00:51:24,147 --> 00:51:29,517
They need a humid,
dark environment to breed.

518
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:31,677
Did you ever lose track of him?

519
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:34,880
Well, let's see.

520
00:51:35,058 --> 00:51:39,017
There was that moment when
l had the train on top of my head.

521
00:51:39,196 --> 00:51:40,857
We can't risk it.

522
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:44,330
Tomorrow you'll go back to the tracks
with a group of agents.

523
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:47,299
Search the whole place
top to bottom.

524
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:49,665
Find those eggs and destroy them.

525
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:02,643
''Elizabeth Sherman.''

526
00:52:03,186 --> 00:52:05,916
I don't like the term ''fire-starter. ''

527
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:07,178
I just don't.

528
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:11,727
And ''pyrokinesis'' sounds like
some psychosis or something.

529
00:52:11,895 --> 00:52:13,123
I don't know.

530
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,321
Maybe that's right.

531
00:52:15,498 --> 00:52:17,864
Not being able to let go.

532
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:19,331
It's scary.

533
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:24,464
I black out after each episode.
Sometimes for hours.

534
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:27,439
You hear about so and so...

535
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:30,136
...who just lost control
and just exploded.

536
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,042
Well, they're lucky it isn't true.

537
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:34,441
With me, it is.

538
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:51,192
My master is calling
your name now, my girl.

539
00:52:51,935 --> 00:52:54,699
You must return to the child.

540
00:52:54,938 --> 00:52:56,997
So once again...

541
00:52:57,474 --> 00:52:59,635
...dream...

542
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:02,203
...of fire.

543
00:53:18,962 --> 00:53:20,190
Hey, freak!

544
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:23,257
Get back here, freak!

545
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:24,957
-Let's get her!
-Get her!

546
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:27,432
-Get her, guys!
-Watch this!

547
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:30,098
Freak!

548
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:36,302
Oh, no! Not again.

549
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:39,145
Oh, no! Somebody!

550
00:53:39,316 --> 00:53:40,715
Help me!

551
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:44,011
Help me, somebody! Help me!

552
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:33,334
How many buildings
does she have to burn down?

553
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:35,334
She belongs here.

554
00:54:35,638 --> 00:54:36,969
That's not what she feels.

555
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:40,043
She may never feel it.
lt's her choice.

556
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:40,543
She may never feel it.
lt's her choice.

557
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:42,045
Professor, the girl you're--

558
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:47,050
Professor,
that girl you're talking about....

559
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:48,051
Hey, Boy Scout...

560
00:54:48,051 --> 00:54:48,551
Hey, Boy Scout...

561
00:54:48,551 --> 00:54:49,719
...think twice.

562
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:51,810
No, listen, l read her file.

563
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:54,813
-''Read her file.''
-She blames herself...

564
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:58,757
...for that explosion in Pittsburgh.
Look, l think l can help.

565
00:55:00,029 --> 00:55:01,360
l could talk to her.

566
00:55:01,531 --> 00:55:03,362
l think l could bring her back.

567
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:07,133
Just what was it that landed you
this job pushing ''pamcakes,'' huh?

568
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:08,994
What was it?

569
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:12,198
Punctuality?
The way you part your hair?

570
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:14,366
What is your area of expertise?

571
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:18,646
He doesn't want me with him.

572
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,142
l know that much.

573
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:22,580
-You're doing fine.
-No, l'm not.

574
00:55:22,752 --> 00:55:24,982
Look, he respects Clay, not me.

575
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:28,519
l'm really sorry, okay?

576
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,059
l'm not your guy.

577
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:35,897
l'm dying, Agent Myers.

578
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:40,168
Like any father, l worry about him.

579
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:46,336
ln medieval stories,
there is often a young knight...

580
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:50,070
...who is inexperienced...

581
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,775
-...but pure of heart.
-Come on.

582
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:56,145
Look, l am not pure of heart.

583
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:57,877
Yes, you are.

584
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:01,450
Rasputin is back for him.

585
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:03,454
What l ask of you...

586
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:07,687
...is to have the courage
to stand by him when l am gone.

587
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:11,159
He was born a demon.
Can't change that.

588
00:56:11,334 --> 00:56:13,359
But you will help him...

589
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:15,968
...in essence...

590
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:18,197
...to become a man.

591
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:34,679
Pull that down.

592
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:36,758
She was making great progress...

593
00:56:36,926 --> 00:56:38,086
...and now this.

594
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:40,252
We'll be closed for months.

595
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:42,762
And it put a big dent
in our Thorazine supply.

596
00:56:43,766 --> 00:56:46,326
She's been like this
since it happened.

597
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:51,867
Are you sure you want to go in?

598
00:56:59,649 --> 00:57:01,583
Miss Sherman?

599
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:04,379
l'm Agent Myers, FBl.

600
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:09,688
Miss Sherman?

601
00:57:11,628 --> 00:57:14,290
Can l call you Liz?

602
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:16,898
lt's a beautiful name.

603
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:20,695
Sixty percent of all the women
in the world are named Liz.

604
00:57:21,571 --> 00:57:25,530
Well, it's impressive by my standards.
My name's John.

605
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:28,377
John T. Myers.

606
00:57:29,012 --> 00:57:31,480
Dr. Broom asked me to invite you
back to the bureau.

607
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:35,277
No special precautions,
no security escorts.

608
00:57:35,451 --> 00:57:38,909
Just you and me in a taxi
like regular folks.

609
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:41,720
That doesn't sound like him.

610
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:45,258
Well, Miss Sherman,
he's asking you back...

611
00:57:45,428 --> 00:57:47,623
...but it's entirely your choice,
you know?

612
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,488
Choice, huh?

613
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:51,463
That's cute.

614
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:54,967
l've quit the bureau 1 3 times.

615
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:57,368
l always go back.

616
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:59,735
Where else would l go?

617
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:19,017
Over here.

618
00:58:20,496 --> 00:58:22,987
You said those eggs need it
dark and humid?

619
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,100
Well, they hit the jackpot.

620
00:58:25,268 --> 00:58:28,601
The subway lines,
they all converge right around here.

621
00:58:28,805 --> 00:58:31,205
Right below us
is the old Vandeveer reservoir.

622
00:58:31,374 --> 00:58:33,171
lt was abandoned in the mid-30s.

623
00:58:33,376 --> 00:58:34,934
There's a pulse.

624
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:41,011
There. A cistern on the other side.

625
00:58:44,554 --> 00:58:46,647
Most of the eggs are there.

626
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:49,121
There's no way in.

627
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:53,596
We should go back and request
a special permit, type 2--

628
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,545
You guys coming or what?

629
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:36,764
We lead a charmed life.

630
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,151
Here you are, doctor.

631
00:59:54,857 --> 00:59:56,359
This should cover your tail fin.

632
00:59:56,859 --> 00:59:58,361
Reliquary. Straight from the Vatican.

633
00:59:58,361 --> 00:59:58,861
Reliquary. Straight from the Vatican.

634
01:00:01,364 --> 01:00:01,864
A bone from St. Dionysius.
Looks like a pinkie.

635
01:00:01,864 --> 01:00:02,365
A bone from St. Dionysius.
Looks like a pinkie.

636
01:00:02,365 --> 01:00:03,866
A bone from St. Dionysius.
Looks like a pinkie.

637
01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:04,867
A bone from St. Dionysius.
Looks like a pinkie.

638
01:00:05,868 --> 01:00:07,370
Remind me why l keep doing this.

639
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:07,770
Remind me why l keep doing this.

640
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:10,432
Rotten eggs
and the safety of mankind.

641
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:57,713
This doesn't really look
like doll's hair.

642
01:00:57,887 --> 01:00:59,616
Be honest, Red. What do you think?

643
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:02,688
l'm thinking about doing it myself.

644
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:05,585
Hey, you guys find anything?

645
01:01:05,762 --> 01:01:06,751
No eggs yet, Red.

646
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:08,726
What, are you on a lunch break?

647
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:10,263
Nothing here.

648
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:21,906
Red's on the move. l'll cover him.

649
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:30,685
Damn it, Red.

650
01:03:15,791 --> 01:03:16,780
Hey, it's Abe.

651
01:03:22,431 --> 01:03:24,490
Oh, God.

652
01:03:26,402 --> 01:03:27,892
Bring your toy over here.

653
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:30,763
Oh, man.

654
01:03:31,507 --> 01:03:32,906
Oh, Jesus.

655
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:36,638
There's only one. l'll fry him quick.

656
01:03:36,812 --> 01:03:38,905
Two. There were two.

657
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:08,168
Red?

658
01:04:08,844 --> 01:04:10,141
Red. Come in, Red.

659
01:04:10,313 --> 01:04:13,510
What's your 20? l got no signal.
Where the hell are you?

660
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:16,015
It's like Swiss cheese in here.

661
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,586
Sit tight, pal, l'm on him.

662
01:04:35,408 --> 01:04:38,241
Sammael, hound of the resurrection.

663
01:04:41,981 --> 01:04:43,881
Didn't l kill you already?

664
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:57,088
You goddamn monster!

665
01:05:19,385 --> 01:05:20,409
Oh, crap.

666
01:05:35,869 --> 01:05:37,166
lt's for you!

667
01:05:37,337 --> 01:05:40,135
You shouldn't hurt people!

668
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:02,254
You missed.

669
01:06:22,015 --> 01:06:24,279
Hey, chunk-face.

670
01:06:25,952 --> 01:06:29,444
You can do better than that,
big monster like you.

671
01:07:20,373 --> 01:07:22,475
My kittens! Please!

672
01:07:22,475 --> 01:07:22,976
My kittens! Please!

673
01:07:22,976 --> 01:07:24,978
Somebody, please, get my kittens!

674
01:07:24,978 --> 01:07:25,979
Somebody, please, get my kittens!

675
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:32,183
Second date.

676
01:07:33,086 --> 01:07:34,553
No tongue.

677
01:07:47,233 --> 01:07:49,667
My kittens. Careful with them!

678
01:07:49,836 --> 01:07:51,827
Lady, give me a break!

679
01:08:12,358 --> 01:08:13,347
Thank you.

680
01:08:15,028 --> 01:08:16,052
My job.

681
01:09:08,581 --> 01:09:12,585
Clay, I'm getting a signal from Abe.
I'm on my way back.

682
01:09:12,585 --> 01:09:13,086
Clay, I'm getting a signal from Abe.
I'm on my way back.

683
01:09:16,089 --> 01:09:18,091
Buddy, don't take another step.

684
01:09:18,091 --> 01:09:18,591
Buddy, don't take another step.

685
01:09:43,916 --> 01:09:45,645
Clay.

686
01:10:19,785 --> 01:10:22,811
Man down. l need an ambulance
right away. Do you read me?

687
01:10:23,022 --> 01:10:24,649
Hang in there, pal.

688
01:10:25,057 --> 01:10:28,458
Man down.
Do you read? Do you read?

689
01:10:30,930 --> 01:10:33,194
Quarry, Moss, do you read me?

690
01:10:33,766 --> 01:10:36,758
Quarry, Moss, do you read me?
Man down!

691
01:10:42,642 --> 01:10:46,669
Feels good to be outside.
lt's been so long.

692
01:10:46,846 --> 01:10:49,406
You know that's--
That's not safe Miss Sherman.

693
01:10:49,582 --> 01:10:51,413
Please stay in the car.

694
01:10:55,688 --> 01:10:59,784
No, no. Miss Sherman. Please,
can you come down, Miss Sherman?

695
01:11:08,367 --> 01:11:09,959
Nice view.

696
01:11:10,903 --> 01:11:14,805
Hey, a smile, huh?
Yeah, that's good.

697
01:11:15,374 --> 01:11:17,035
Here.

698
01:11:18,544 --> 01:11:20,307
Damn.

699
01:11:21,147 --> 01:11:25,311
-You'll have to take another one later.
-Yeah.

700
01:11:49,041 --> 01:11:51,066
He'll make it.

701
01:11:53,112 --> 01:11:55,273
Not everyone was so lucky.

702
01:11:56,849 --> 01:11:59,215
We had two agents die today.

703
01:11:59,885 --> 01:12:02,319
Clay probably won't survive
the night.

704
01:12:02,488 --> 01:12:05,218
-Not now, Manning, please.
-My problem with you:

705
01:12:06,926 --> 01:12:08,393
You're reckless.

706
01:12:08,561 --> 01:12:11,894
These men trusted you
to lead them as a team.

707
01:12:12,064 --> 01:12:13,929
Where were you?

708
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,665
l knew those men
better than you did.

709
01:12:16,836 --> 01:12:20,533
-That makes it all right, then.
-No, it doesn't make it all right.

710
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:23,042
-But l stopped that thing, didn't l?
-Yes, you did.

711
01:12:23,042 --> 01:12:23,776
-But l stopped that thing, didn't l?
-Yes, you did.

712
01:12:23,776 --> 01:12:24,277
-But l stopped that thing, didn't l?
-Yes, you did.

713
01:12:24,277 --> 01:12:25,778
lt's what you do.
lt's why we need you.

714
01:12:25,778 --> 01:12:26,279
lt's what you do.
lt's why we need you.

715
01:12:26,279 --> 01:12:29,282
You have an insight.
You know monsters.

716
01:12:30,783 --> 01:12:31,784
What are you trying to say?

717
01:12:31,784 --> 01:12:32,785
What are you trying to say?

718
01:12:33,786 --> 01:12:35,788
This whole thing is a farce.

719
01:12:35,788 --> 01:12:36,289
This whole thing is a farce.

720
01:12:36,789 --> 01:12:37,790
Because in the end...

721
01:12:38,291 --> 01:12:39,692
...after you've killed, after you've
captured every freak out there...

722
01:12:39,692 --> 01:12:41,626
...after you've killed, after you've
captured every freak out there...

723
01:12:42,561 --> 01:12:44,358
...there's still one left.

724
01:12:45,231 --> 01:12:46,721
You.

725
01:12:51,170 --> 01:12:52,899
Hey, Manning.

726
01:12:53,072 --> 01:12:55,666
l wish l could be more gracious, but....

727
01:13:02,048 --> 01:13:04,448
Welcome back.

728
01:13:06,085 --> 01:13:08,713
lt's only for the weekend,
Professor Broom.

729
01:13:09,622 --> 01:13:12,090
Then l shall be on my way.

730
01:13:12,258 --> 01:13:15,227
Oh, you should have a look around.

731
01:13:15,394 --> 01:13:17,760
We made some changes
around here.

732
01:13:25,104 --> 01:13:28,870
l want that thing locked up,
starting now.

733
01:13:29,041 --> 01:13:30,804
Right now! Do you--?

734
01:13:31,177 --> 01:13:33,077
Now, you hear me?

735
01:13:33,245 --> 01:13:35,179
-Locked up!
-Nothing's changed.

736
01:13:35,381 --> 01:13:36,507
Home sweet home.

737
01:13:36,816 --> 01:13:38,044
Liz?

738
01:13:40,619 --> 01:13:42,280
Liz!

739
01:13:44,323 --> 01:13:47,019
You did it, buddy. You did it!

740
01:13:50,596 --> 01:13:52,393
Myers?

741
01:13:52,932 --> 01:13:54,627
Pop?

742
01:14:02,541 --> 01:14:04,975
Hey, how you doing?

743
01:14:05,144 --> 01:14:07,135
Hey, what's that on your wrist?

744
01:14:08,247 --> 01:14:09,839
This?

745
01:14:10,015 --> 01:14:14,247
-lt's something l learned in therapy.
-Yeah?

746
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:17,412
l'm depressed, one rubber band.

747
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:19,387
l'm impatient...

748
01:14:21,627 --> 01:14:23,458
...two rubber bands.

749
01:14:23,629 --> 01:14:25,494
Maybe....

750
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:30,066
Maybe l should get you
a fresh pack.

751
01:14:32,371 --> 01:14:34,100
Yeah, maybe two.

752
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,608
Yeah, maybe.

753
01:14:44,717 --> 01:14:47,083
l'm gonna put these over here, okay?

754
01:14:47,253 --> 01:14:48,515
One minute. One minute.

755
01:14:51,991 --> 01:14:53,549
Hey, Myers...

756
01:14:53,726 --> 01:14:55,853
...you're a talker.

757
01:14:56,095 --> 01:14:59,326
What's a good word,
a solid word, for ''need''?

758
01:14:59,498 --> 01:15:00,658
Well...

759
01:15:00,833 --> 01:15:02,824
...''need'' is a good, solid word.

760
01:15:03,002 --> 01:15:04,230
Too needy.

761
01:15:04,403 --> 01:15:06,871
Start in, okay?
You got nachos coming.

762
01:15:08,707 --> 01:15:09,833
Nachos.

763
01:15:10,009 --> 01:15:11,601
Oh, my God.

764
01:15:11,777 --> 01:15:13,608
Look at them all.

765
01:15:14,346 --> 01:15:16,473
Who had babies?

766
01:15:18,117 --> 01:15:23,077
Liz, there's something l need
for you to hear, and it's....

767
01:15:23,255 --> 01:15:25,746
Will it take long?
Because l'm actually going out.

768
01:15:27,526 --> 01:15:28,515
Out?

769
01:15:30,062 --> 01:15:31,051
''Out'' out?

770
01:15:31,597 --> 01:15:35,590
Yeah. Yeah, for a cup of coffee,
but go ahead, read.

771
01:15:35,768 --> 01:15:37,258
Are you going alone?

772
01:15:38,771 --> 01:15:41,103
No, Myers is taking me.

773
01:15:42,107 --> 01:15:44,507
Hey, your chili's getting cold.

774
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:46,134
Not hungry.

775
01:15:48,214 --> 01:15:50,273
ls there something
you'd like me to hear?

776
01:15:50,449 --> 01:15:53,145
-lt's just a list. lt's not finished.
-Okay.

777
01:15:53,319 --> 01:15:55,253
Well, then, later.

778
01:15:56,021 --> 01:15:57,750
See you.

779
01:15:59,058 --> 01:16:01,151
-Anything else you need?
-Not from you.

780
01:16:02,328 --> 01:16:03,317
Well, good night.

781
01:16:04,530 --> 01:16:05,690
Goodbye.

782
01:16:15,508 --> 01:16:18,671
Subject: Karl Ruprecht Kroenen.

783
01:16:19,011 --> 01:16:21,912
Born in Munich, 1 89 7.

784
01:16:22,982 --> 01:16:25,883
Suffered from
a masochistic compulsion...

785
01:16:26,752 --> 01:16:30,085
...commonly known
as surgical addiction.

786
01:16:33,492 --> 01:16:36,893
Both eyelids surgically removed...

787
01:16:40,165 --> 01:16:42,030
...along with his upper...

788
01:16:43,435 --> 01:16:45,027
...and lower lip.

789
01:16:46,839 --> 01:16:50,832
The blood in his veins
dried up decades ago.

790
01:16:52,611 --> 01:16:55,808
Only dust remains.

791
01:16:59,184 --> 01:17:02,210
What horrible will...

792
01:17:03,055 --> 01:17:06,115
...could keep such a creature
as this alive?

793
01:17:40,159 --> 01:17:42,150
Oh, no.

794
01:17:43,963 --> 01:17:45,954
Come on, Red.

795
01:17:48,033 --> 01:17:49,728
Jesus.

796
01:17:55,874 --> 01:17:59,139
Damn it, Red. Not again

797
01:18:00,813 --> 01:18:03,373
And one of those cookies.
Do you have any doughnuts?

798
01:18:03,549 --> 01:18:05,881
Sorry, pal. How about a bear claw?

799
01:18:23,636 --> 01:18:26,730
Do you want anything else?
The shop's closing.

800
01:18:26,905 --> 01:18:28,736
Here we go.

801
01:18:28,941 --> 01:18:30,670
Listen about....

802
01:18:31,043 --> 01:18:33,637
l admire him. He's a force of nature.

803
01:18:33,812 --> 01:18:36,406
What are you two talking about?

804
01:18:36,582 --> 01:18:39,881
What is so fascinating,
so important?

805
01:18:40,052 --> 01:18:42,418
No. He's determined, unstoppable.

806
01:18:42,588 --> 01:18:44,579
Some people would call that cocky.

807
01:18:44,757 --> 01:18:47,248
-He's just strong.
-Yeah. That he is.

808
01:18:47,426 --> 01:18:48,893
Hey, l've got yours.

809
01:18:49,662 --> 01:18:54,258
My uncle, he used to say
we like people for their qualities...

810
01:18:54,433 --> 01:18:56,628
...but love them for their defects.

811
01:18:58,671 --> 01:19:00,434
He loves you, you know.

812
01:19:02,708 --> 01:19:04,107
What about you?

813
01:19:05,778 --> 01:19:08,508
l don't know. l grew up with him.

814
01:19:10,349 --> 01:19:13,318
But now every time l see him,
l get confused.

815
01:19:13,485 --> 01:19:16,454
There's hardly a day that goes by
that he's not in my mind.

816
01:19:16,622 --> 01:19:17,782
Even now...

817
01:19:18,924 --> 01:19:21,017
...l feel like he's here.

818
01:19:22,461 --> 01:19:24,019
Hey, wait up.

819
01:19:27,099 --> 01:19:29,499
You like doughnuts? l got two.

820
01:19:30,335 --> 01:19:33,133
-Thanks. That was nice.
-l got a cookie, as well.

821
01:19:33,305 --> 01:19:35,535
-Sugar?
-No. No sugar. Thank you.

822
01:19:35,708 --> 01:19:38,199
No cream and sugar, moron.
She takes it black.

823
01:19:38,644 --> 01:19:41,545
-l got some milk here.
-No. l'm okay. l don't take milk.

824
01:19:42,347 --> 01:19:43,575
Told you.

825
01:19:47,419 --> 01:19:48,909
She took his picture.

826
01:19:49,388 --> 01:19:50,548
Damn!

827
01:19:52,725 --> 01:19:54,556
She took his picture.

828
01:19:56,929 --> 01:19:58,590
She took his picture.

829
01:20:01,467 --> 01:20:02,957
She took his picture.

830
01:20:06,271 --> 01:20:07,568
Oh, crap.

831
01:20:17,116 --> 01:20:18,640
lt's freezing, isn't it?

832
01:20:19,284 --> 01:20:21,115
Coffee's warming me up.

833
01:20:22,421 --> 01:20:24,184
Well, what do we do now?

834
01:20:24,356 --> 01:20:27,757
Newark, New Jersey,
entertainment capital of the world.

835
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:31,258
-You sound like a game-show host.
-Hi.

836
01:20:31,630 --> 01:20:33,097
Hey.

837
01:20:35,501 --> 01:20:36,559
You're Hellboy.

838
01:20:40,305 --> 01:20:42,273
l'm on a mission.

839
01:20:45,177 --> 01:20:48,510
All right, tell me something about you.
Where do you come from?

840
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:51,046
l lived with my uncle most of my life.

841
01:20:51,216 --> 01:20:54,811
Then l went to Quantico, went to top
of my class. l'm nothing like--

842
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:56,414
Don't tell anyone, huh?

843
01:21:00,192 --> 01:21:01,284
Attaboy.

844
01:21:09,701 --> 01:21:11,896
Sir, he left his locator.

845
01:21:12,070 --> 01:21:16,268
-Shall we send out some scouts?
-Enough, enough, enough.

846
01:21:18,043 --> 01:21:20,477
He'll never change.

847
01:21:20,779 --> 01:21:22,371
A child.

848
01:21:23,482 --> 01:21:25,916
Always a child.

849
01:21:40,532 --> 01:21:44,935
Sebastian Plackba, number 1 6.

850
01:21:45,103 --> 01:21:46,832
Moscow.

851
01:21:47,005 --> 01:21:49,803
Who wants us in Moscow?

852
01:22:37,055 --> 01:22:39,717
-My mom baked them.
-She's laughing.

853
01:22:40,626 --> 01:22:43,322
She's sitting on a park bench,
and she's laughing.

854
01:22:43,896 --> 01:22:46,421
That's it. l'm done.

855
01:22:46,832 --> 01:22:48,732
They don't look like spies.

856
01:22:49,601 --> 01:22:51,569
Are you kidding me?

857
01:22:51,904 --> 01:22:53,565
Look at this guy.

858
01:22:53,739 --> 01:22:57,436
Those shady little eyes,
that phony grin.

859
01:22:57,976 --> 01:23:00,410
-Are you going to eat that?
-No.

860
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:05,208
Hey, he's yawning. He's bored.

861
01:23:05,384 --> 01:23:07,978
Yeah, the old yawning trick.

862
01:23:10,055 --> 01:23:11,647
Watch his arm.

863
01:23:18,363 --> 01:23:21,855
First he wants my job,
then he wants my girl.

864
01:23:25,537 --> 01:23:28,802
Hey, we all have a side
that we try to hide.

865
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:36,872
God--

866
01:23:37,149 --> 01:23:38,741
Hey, what the hell?

867
01:23:38,917 --> 01:23:42,114
Hey! Hey, who threw that?

868
01:23:45,057 --> 01:23:48,083
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, l'm fine.

869
01:23:51,163 --> 01:23:52,687
Nice shot.

870
01:23:57,436 --> 01:24:01,463
Sebastian Plackba, number 1 6.

871
01:24:02,174 --> 01:24:04,836
lt's Rasputin's mausoleum.

872
01:24:12,117 --> 01:24:13,846
l see the puppet.

873
01:24:14,619 --> 01:24:16,883
But where is...

874
01:24:17,856 --> 01:24:19,380
...the puppeteer?

875
01:24:19,558 --> 01:24:21,492
Very good, Professor Broom.

876
01:24:23,328 --> 01:24:24,795
lt was you.

877
01:24:24,963 --> 01:24:27,431
The scraps of paper...

878
01:24:27,599 --> 01:24:30,397
...Liz's sudden relapse and return.

879
01:24:30,569 --> 01:24:32,469
Bread crumbs on the trail.

880
01:24:32,637 --> 01:24:34,468
Like in a fable.

881
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:36,865
They both distract him...

882
01:24:37,642 --> 01:24:39,769
...and guide him exactly
where l need him.

883
01:24:39,945 --> 01:24:41,105
Moscow.

884
01:24:41,279 --> 01:24:43,270
His destiny.

885
01:24:44,716 --> 01:24:46,013
And the last clue...

886
01:24:46,184 --> 01:24:49,312
...will be left by
the late Professor Broom.

887
01:24:49,488 --> 01:24:51,183
You raised the child.

888
01:24:51,356 --> 01:24:53,221
Nurtured him.

889
01:24:53,392 --> 01:24:55,485
So in return...

890
01:24:55,927 --> 01:24:57,519
...l will permit you...

891
01:24:57,696 --> 01:25:02,360
...a brief, brief glimpse of the future.

892
01:25:30,862 --> 01:25:33,023
He will open the portal...

893
01:25:33,198 --> 01:25:36,065
...and bring about
the end of the world.

894
01:25:40,372 --> 01:25:43,864
If only you had had him destroyed
60 years ago...

895
01:25:44,042 --> 01:25:46,203
...none of this would have
come to pass.

896
01:25:46,378 --> 01:25:49,745
But then,
how could you have known?

897
01:25:49,915 --> 01:25:52,975
Your God chooses to remain silent.

898
01:25:53,718 --> 01:25:56,016
Mine lives within me.

899
01:25:56,188 --> 01:25:58,782
Every time l died and crossed over...

900
01:25:59,724 --> 01:26:04,024
...a little more of the master...

901
01:26:04,196 --> 01:26:06,494
...came back with me.

902
01:26:07,165 --> 01:26:10,566
He disclosed to me
the child's true name.

903
01:26:11,403 --> 01:26:13,234
Would you like to know it?

904
01:26:13,405 --> 01:26:17,102
l know what to call him.

905
01:26:19,044 --> 01:26:22,810
Nothing you can do or say...

906
01:26:22,981 --> 01:26:25,211
...can change that.

907
01:26:26,118 --> 01:26:28,086
l call him...

908
01:26:30,388 --> 01:26:31,650
...Son.

909
01:26:37,229 --> 01:26:39,026
l'm ready.

910
01:26:41,166 --> 01:26:42,463
lt'll be quick.

911
01:27:06,858 --> 01:27:10,191
Just go there
and tell her how you feel.

912
01:27:12,430 --> 01:27:13,590
My mom says that--

913
01:27:13,765 --> 01:27:16,700
Look, it's not--
lt's not that easy, okay?

914
01:27:19,437 --> 01:27:21,564
Plus, you're 9.

915
01:27:22,073 --> 01:27:24,667
You're not old enough
to be giving me advice.

916
01:27:26,645 --> 01:27:29,307
-All right, stand by.
-Who are those guys?

917
01:27:37,189 --> 01:27:40,886
Liz, l'm sorry. lt's Broom.
Let's go. We need to find him.

918
01:27:41,059 --> 01:27:42,924
-No!
-Wait, what happened?

919
01:27:43,094 --> 01:27:44,425
-No!
-lt's okay.

920
01:27:44,596 --> 01:27:45,961
No, not him.

921
01:27:46,131 --> 01:27:48,122
-Would you take her?
-Something's wrong.

922
01:29:37,008 --> 01:29:39,909
He hasn't spoken to anybody
in three days.

923
01:29:40,578 --> 01:29:42,239
Not a word.

924
01:29:42,547 --> 01:29:45,038
He won't eat, he won't sleep.

925
01:29:45,650 --> 01:29:47,709
l've never seen him like this.

926
01:29:47,886 --> 01:29:48,875
Never.

927
01:29:49,554 --> 01:29:51,454
Should l stay?

928
01:29:52,057 --> 01:29:54,184
With him, l mean?

929
01:29:55,994 --> 01:30:00,226
Listen, l'm not much
of a problem solver.

930
01:30:01,466 --> 01:30:06,028
Three decades,
l've only completed two sides.

931
01:30:06,204 --> 01:30:07,637
But l do know this much.

932
01:30:07,806 --> 01:30:10,036
lf there's trouble...

933
01:30:10,208 --> 01:30:14,144
...all us freaks have is each other.

934
01:30:15,413 --> 01:30:16,971
And l'm stuck here.

935
01:30:17,148 --> 01:30:18,775
So...

936
01:30:18,950 --> 01:30:22,351
...take care of the big monkey for me,
will you?

937
01:31:04,796 --> 01:31:08,789
l have accumulated many objects
of great interest...

938
01:31:08,967 --> 01:31:11,902
...preserving our heritage.

939
01:31:14,272 --> 01:31:17,366
Many, like me,
believe Mother Russia...

940
01:31:17,542 --> 01:31:22,002
...to be very close
to a historic rebirth.

941
01:31:23,148 --> 01:31:24,775
''Rebirth''?

942
01:31:25,850 --> 01:31:27,875
l like that.

943
01:31:34,192 --> 01:31:36,922
Twenty tons of stone.

944
01:31:37,095 --> 01:31:40,030
This thing fell from the sky
into Tunguska Forest.

945
01:31:40,198 --> 01:31:42,189
June 30th, 1 908.

946
01:31:42,367 --> 01:31:45,530
The Romanovs took possession
of it immediately.

947
01:31:45,703 --> 01:31:47,796
l've wanted it for ages.

948
01:31:47,972 --> 01:31:49,337
You're aware, of course...

949
01:31:49,507 --> 01:31:53,238
...there's no way you'll get it out
of Russian territory.

950
01:31:53,411 --> 01:31:57,848
He is aware.
Our guests are coming in.

951
01:31:58,183 --> 01:32:02,210
Volokolamsk Fields, 50 miles from
Moscow, that's where we're going.

952
01:32:02,387 --> 01:32:06,756
Sebastian Plackba, number 1 6.
That's the only clue we have.

953
01:32:06,925 --> 01:32:09,621
We've collected
and destroyed thousands of eggs...

954
01:32:09,794 --> 01:32:13,753
...but we have no trace of this
Sammael or this Rasputin character.

955
01:32:13,932 --> 01:32:17,459
We leave as soon
as we get clearance and equipment.

956
01:32:17,635 --> 01:32:19,296
Hellboy's coming.

957
01:32:19,804 --> 01:32:22,830
l'm not pleased about that,
but l'll be in charge this time.

958
01:32:23,007 --> 01:32:27,501
We either wrap this up or l'm closing
this freak show for good.

959
01:32:37,722 --> 01:32:39,019
Hi.

960
01:32:39,357 --> 01:32:40,415
Hi.

961
01:32:45,263 --> 01:32:46,924
l'll...

962
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:49,029
...come to Moscow...

963
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:51,532
...if you're still going.

964
01:32:52,003 --> 01:32:53,163
l am.

965
01:32:53,671 --> 01:32:56,071
But l have something to say.

966
01:32:58,543 --> 01:33:00,943
l understand
what you don't like about me.

967
01:33:01,112 --> 01:33:02,374
l do.

968
01:33:03,715 --> 01:33:05,205
What l am...

969
01:33:06,784 --> 01:33:09,344
...makes you feel
a little out of place...

970
01:33:09,821 --> 01:33:10,810
...out there.

971
01:33:10,989 --> 01:33:12,479
-Red, l don't--
-Listen.

972
01:33:15,093 --> 01:33:16,526
l'm not like Myers.

973
01:33:17,762 --> 01:33:20,162
He makes you feel like you belong...

974
01:33:20,899 --> 01:33:22,526
...which is good, really.

975
01:33:29,407 --> 01:33:32,001
l wish l could do something about this.

976
01:33:34,012 --> 01:33:35,877
l can't.

977
01:33:38,016 --> 01:33:40,382
l can promise you two things:

978
01:33:41,519 --> 01:33:44,010
One, l'll always look this good.

979
01:33:48,893 --> 01:33:51,020
And two...

980
01:33:52,530 --> 01:33:54,430
...l'll never give up on you.

981
01:33:57,235 --> 01:33:58,361
Ever.

982
01:34:00,505 --> 01:34:02,063
l like that.

983
01:34:16,621 --> 01:34:20,216
This engraving here
represents Sammy. Text reads:

984
01:34:20,391 --> 01:34:24,919
''One falls, two shall arise. Sammael.''

985
01:34:26,798 --> 01:34:29,426
We'll have to nail them all at once,
and the eggs.

986
01:34:29,601 --> 01:34:31,626
And when we do, no mumbo jumbo.

987
01:34:33,004 --> 01:34:35,837
Double-core Vulcan-65 grenades.

988
01:34:36,007 --> 01:34:39,374
We've installed a handy little timer.
You set it, you walk away.

989
01:34:39,544 --> 01:34:41,444
Cable pulls the safety pins.

990
01:34:41,779 --> 01:34:42,768
Kaboom.

991
01:34:42,947 --> 01:34:45,040
Easy to clean, easy to use.

992
01:34:51,823 --> 01:34:55,054
Sparky to Big Red.
Do you read me? Come in.

993
01:34:57,895 --> 01:34:59,192
''Sparky''?

994
01:34:59,364 --> 01:35:01,662
Who came up with that? Myers?

995
01:35:01,966 --> 01:35:04,992
Yeah, we're leaving the main road,
so hang on.

996
01:35:05,169 --> 01:35:07,194
This better be the place or l'll puke.

997
01:35:14,479 --> 01:35:16,071
You better come out and see.

998
01:35:28,726 --> 01:35:32,162
Sebastian Plackba, number 1 6.

999
01:35:41,873 --> 01:35:46,037
Forget it. We're never gonna find
Rasputin's mausoleum.

1000
01:35:46,210 --> 01:35:48,644
lt's practically a city.

1001
01:35:48,813 --> 01:35:51,111
And it stinks, and it's muddy.

1002
01:35:51,282 --> 01:35:56,276
l think we go back, we check
into the hotel, we regroup.

1003
01:35:56,454 --> 01:35:58,285
After breakfast.

1004
01:35:58,456 --> 01:36:01,914
l think what we have to do here
is we have to make a grid.

1005
01:36:02,093 --> 01:36:07,190
We go in by quadrants.
Maybe satellite photography.

1006
01:36:10,535 --> 01:36:12,594
Let me ask for directions.

1007
01:36:14,806 --> 01:36:16,797
Where are you going?

1008
01:36:27,185 --> 01:36:30,586
Come on, baby, find me a talker.

1009
01:36:49,207 --> 01:36:50,367
Hi there.

1010
01:37:10,995 --> 01:37:12,257
Come on.

1011
01:37:13,397 --> 01:37:14,489
Come on.

1012
01:37:15,399 --> 01:37:16,627
Come on.

1013
01:37:20,238 --> 01:37:21,933
What do you want?

1014
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:24,637
This is ridiculous.

1015
01:37:26,778 --> 01:37:28,302
l run this show, not him.

1016
01:37:28,479 --> 01:37:30,208
This guy's nothing but trouble.

1017
01:37:32,517 --> 01:37:34,985
-Ten minutes, we're out of here.
-Will you shut up...

1018
01:37:35,153 --> 01:37:37,121
...and let him do his thing?

1019
01:37:37,288 --> 01:37:39,188
Anybody got a PowerBar?

1020
01:37:42,059 --> 01:37:44,459
Hey, there he is.

1021
01:37:46,430 --> 01:37:48,830
Sixty feet further, comrades.

1022
01:37:49,767 --> 01:37:51,359
And three rows in.

1023
01:37:52,103 --> 01:37:54,264
What the hell is that on his back?

1024
01:37:55,006 --> 01:37:57,736
This here is lvan Klimentovich.

1025
01:37:57,942 --> 01:37:59,603
Say ''hi,'' lvan.

1026
01:37:59,877 --> 01:38:02,311
Go that way, Red Monkey!

1027
01:38:02,513 --> 01:38:03,502
Gotcha.

1028
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:18,793
lvan says there's a whole network
of tunnels down here.

1029
01:38:18,963 --> 01:38:20,294
Goes on for miles.

1030
01:38:25,369 --> 01:38:27,894
Stay close, everybody.

1031
01:38:28,472 --> 01:38:30,133
You better be right about this.

1032
01:38:38,883 --> 01:38:41,374
We'll be all right as long as
we don't separate.

1033
01:38:59,437 --> 01:39:01,428
Hey, Sparky.

1034
01:39:01,606 --> 01:39:05,235
Tell everyone to turn their locator
belts on. Anybody sees anything....

1035
01:39:05,409 --> 01:39:06,603
l'll say ''Marco.''

1036
01:39:06,777 --> 01:39:07,801
Polo.

1037
01:39:08,246 --> 01:39:11,579
-Are you sure about this?
-On a scale of one to ten: two.

1038
01:39:12,149 --> 01:39:15,312
Don't worry, Boy Scout,
she'll take care of you.

1039
01:39:15,486 --> 01:39:17,147
She's a tough one.

1040
01:39:20,825 --> 01:39:21,883
Come on.

1041
01:39:32,770 --> 01:39:35,500
Ask your buddy
how far this thing goes.

1042
01:39:51,422 --> 01:39:53,322
How you doing up there, lvan?

1043
01:39:53,724 --> 01:39:57,091
lf l had legs l'd kick your ass!

1044
01:39:57,828 --> 01:40:00,854
Would you mind holding this guy
for a while? He is so negative.

1045
01:40:16,147 --> 01:40:17,478
What the hell is that?

1046
01:40:25,957 --> 01:40:27,481
Something big.

1047
01:40:27,658 --> 01:40:29,387
-Lime, come with me.
-Right.

1048
01:40:29,560 --> 01:40:32,825
No, no, no. Stay put!

1049
01:40:35,366 --> 01:40:37,027
Stop!

1050
01:40:37,702 --> 01:40:39,499
You listen to me.

1051
01:40:39,670 --> 01:40:40,728
Listen to me!

1052
01:40:41,806 --> 01:40:42,830
l'm in charge.

1053
01:40:43,007 --> 01:40:45,908
We're gonna go back.
You can take that door apart.

1054
01:40:46,077 --> 01:40:49,706
Whatever it is, it's coming for us.
Now, we gotta move forward!

1055
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:51,211
Lime, let's go!

1056
01:40:51,382 --> 01:40:54,044
Stay put!

1057
01:40:55,319 --> 01:40:59,688
And you! l am not afraid of you!

1058
01:40:59,857 --> 01:41:02,621
l'm in charge! We go back!

1059
01:41:05,830 --> 01:41:10,597
l was better off dead!

1060
01:41:35,092 --> 01:41:36,252
Oh, crap.

1061
01:42:10,461 --> 01:42:12,292
Music.

1062
01:42:55,139 --> 01:42:56,163
Really went deep.

1063
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:04,409
Hey, what's wrong with you?!

1064
01:43:28,038 --> 01:43:29,903
You killed my father.

1065
01:43:30,074 --> 01:43:31,302
Your ass is mine.

1066
01:43:43,420 --> 01:43:45,888
What are you laughing at,
you Nazi son of a--?

1067
01:44:11,815 --> 01:44:13,646
Don't even think about it.

1068
01:44:34,772 --> 01:44:37,570
That's all for you, pinhead.

1069
01:44:46,951 --> 01:44:48,578
What are you doing?

1070
01:44:48,752 --> 01:44:50,310
-What are you doing?
-Having a--

1071
01:44:50,487 --> 01:44:52,216
You never light a cigar that way.

1072
01:44:52,389 --> 01:44:53,856
You use a wooden match.

1073
01:44:56,227 --> 01:44:58,525
Preserves the flavor. You see?

1074
01:45:07,738 --> 01:45:09,296
Thank you.

1075
01:45:09,473 --> 01:45:11,031
Thank you.

1076
01:45:17,581 --> 01:45:20,607
So he thinks you and l....

1077
01:45:22,052 --> 01:45:23,815
That's why he's mad at me.

1078
01:45:29,026 --> 01:45:32,154
But it's not true, right?

1079
01:45:33,964 --> 01:45:34,988
What?

1080
01:45:35,165 --> 01:45:38,396
Well, that, you know,
you feel that way about me.

1081
01:45:38,769 --> 01:45:42,000
You want to know that here? Now?

1082
01:45:46,710 --> 01:45:47,802
Yeah.

1083
01:45:49,913 --> 01:45:53,007
Red, white, whatever.
Guys are all the same.

1084
01:45:55,986 --> 01:45:57,010
Hey, wait up.

1085
01:45:58,188 --> 01:45:59,951
Have you found them yet?

1086
01:46:00,124 --> 01:46:03,093
I got them right below me.
It's a matter of minutes.

1087
01:46:03,260 --> 01:46:04,887
Okay, good.

1088
01:46:06,597 --> 01:46:11,125
Could you hurry up?
Because it's a little spooky in here.

1089
01:46:11,902 --> 01:46:13,971
Liz, wait.

1090
01:46:16,974 --> 01:46:18,976
Oh, my God.

1091
01:46:19,977 --> 01:46:22,479
Let's back out real slow.

1092
01:46:22,479 --> 01:46:22,980
Let's back out real slow.

1093
01:46:40,364 --> 01:46:42,730
Myers, ready your grenades.

1094
01:46:44,301 --> 01:46:46,963
Marco. Marco. Marco.

1095
01:46:47,137 --> 01:46:49,799
Get your big, red butt over here.

1096
01:46:56,080 --> 01:46:57,342
l'm coming for you, kid!

1097
01:47:56,373 --> 01:47:58,568
No piggybacks!

1098
01:48:03,514 --> 01:48:05,345
Get off me, you--

1099
01:48:08,919 --> 01:48:09,943
Liz, no!

1100
01:48:10,120 --> 01:48:12,953
They're gonna kill him!
Do something!

1101
01:48:13,123 --> 01:48:14,556
What do you want me to do?

1102
01:48:14,725 --> 01:48:15,749
-Hit me.
-What?

1103
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:17,925
Hit me.

1104
01:48:19,830 --> 01:48:20,819
Now!

1105
01:48:30,607 --> 01:48:32,837
You should be running.

1106
01:49:42,946 --> 01:49:44,811
They are all here.

1107
01:49:45,249 --> 01:49:46,773
All of them.

1108
01:49:47,284 --> 01:49:50,082
Just the way it was promised.

1109
01:49:53,790 --> 01:49:55,257
This one's awake.

1110
01:50:00,230 --> 01:50:02,721
Thank you for this.

1111
01:50:40,237 --> 01:50:41,829
''And l looked...

1112
01:50:43,073 --> 01:50:44,575
...and beheld an angel.

1113
01:50:46,076 --> 01:50:50,581
And in his right hand,
the key to the bottomless pit.''

1114
01:50:50,581 --> 01:50:51,081
And in his right hand,
the key to the bottomless pit.''

1115
01:50:53,584 --> 01:50:58,589
These were the words l heard
as a peasant boy in Tobolsk.

1116
01:50:58,589 --> 01:51:00,924
And now, the door.

1117
01:51:01,391 --> 01:51:03,621
Sent by the Ogdru Jahad...

1118
01:51:04,227 --> 01:51:09,494
...so that they might at long last
enter our world.

1119
01:51:09,666 --> 01:51:13,659
You are the key,
the right hand of doom.

1120
01:51:14,638 --> 01:51:16,299
Your stone hand.

1121
01:51:16,473 --> 01:51:18,839
What did you think it was made for?

1122
01:51:20,844 --> 01:51:22,243
Open the locks.

1123
01:51:22,412 --> 01:51:24,039
Don't do it, Red! Don't do it!

1124
01:51:26,883 --> 01:51:28,145
Silence.

1125
01:51:30,854 --> 01:51:33,379
lmagine it.

1126
01:51:33,557 --> 01:51:35,650
An Eden...

1127
01:51:35,826 --> 01:51:37,350
...for you and her.

1128
01:51:37,561 --> 01:51:39,129
No.

1129
01:51:39,630 --> 01:51:41,131
No?

1130
01:51:43,133 --> 01:51:45,135
ln exchange for her soul, then?

1131
01:51:51,608 --> 01:51:52,768
Open the door.

1132
01:51:54,444 --> 01:51:56,036
No.

1133
01:51:56,847 --> 01:51:59,179
As you wish.

1134
01:52:00,684 --> 01:52:02,584
No!

1135
01:52:21,805 --> 01:52:23,102
Liz!

1136
01:52:31,882 --> 01:52:34,874
Her soul awaits on the other side.

1137
01:52:35,218 --> 01:52:37,186
lf you want her back...

1138
01:52:37,354 --> 01:52:39,982
...open the door and claim her.

1139
01:52:44,127 --> 01:52:48,757
Your true name is inscribed
around the locks that hold you.

1140
01:52:48,932 --> 01:52:50,422
You cannot break them...

1141
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:53,125
...no matter how strong you are.

1142
01:52:53,303 --> 01:52:55,294
The eclipse has begun.

1143
01:52:58,542 --> 01:53:00,373
Your true name...

1144
01:53:01,478 --> 01:53:03,139
...say it!

1145
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:11,178
Become the key.

1146
01:53:20,297 --> 01:53:22,288
For her.

1147
01:53:23,700 --> 01:53:26,635
Anung un Rama.

1148
01:53:26,803 --> 01:53:28,430
Repeat it.

1149
01:53:28,605 --> 01:53:31,165
Anung un Rama.

1150
01:55:56,553 --> 01:55:58,817
Open the final lock.

1151
01:55:59,522 --> 01:56:02,218
Remember who you are!

1152
01:56:22,545 --> 01:56:25,708
Believe me, l have lived
long enough to know...

1153
01:56:25,882 --> 01:56:28,316
...not a tear will be shed
for this world!

1154
01:56:28,485 --> 01:56:30,009
You have a choice.

1155
01:56:30,186 --> 01:56:32,711
Your father gave you that.

1156
01:56:32,889 --> 01:56:34,220
No, you don't!

1157
01:56:34,391 --> 01:56:35,722
Open it!

1158
01:56:38,395 --> 01:56:39,987
Do it!

1159
01:57:04,154 --> 01:57:05,883
What have you done?

1160
01:57:08,024 --> 01:57:09,651
l chose.

1161
01:57:22,772 --> 01:57:25,400
You will never fulfill your destiny.

1162
01:57:25,575 --> 01:57:29,534
You will never understand
the power inside you.

1163
01:57:29,713 --> 01:57:32,614
l'll just have to find a way
to live with that.

1164
01:57:44,194 --> 01:57:45,661
Child.

1165
01:57:45,829 --> 01:57:47,421
Look what you've done.

1166
01:57:48,198 --> 01:57:50,393
You've killed me...

1167
01:57:51,034 --> 01:57:52,899
...an insignificant man.

1168
01:57:53,069 --> 01:57:55,230
But you have brought forth...

1169
01:57:56,172 --> 01:57:58,106
...a god.

1170
01:58:06,416 --> 01:58:08,475
Myers, let's go.

1171
01:58:27,203 --> 01:58:30,104
Hell will hold no surprises for us.

1172
01:58:43,853 --> 01:58:45,844
l took a grenade belt.

1173
01:58:47,624 --> 01:58:49,751
The damn thing's broken.

1174
01:58:54,631 --> 01:58:56,792
Keep her safe, will you?

1175
01:58:56,966 --> 01:58:59,457
Whatever happens,
don't leave her alone.

1176
01:59:00,103 --> 01:59:01,161
l won't.

1177
01:59:09,212 --> 01:59:11,009
You're okay, Myers.

1178
01:59:11,915 --> 01:59:13,382
Stick around.

1179
01:59:14,017 --> 01:59:15,780
Hey, Red.

1180
01:59:19,189 --> 01:59:20,622
Just pull the cable.

1181
01:59:20,790 --> 01:59:22,189
l didn't get you anything.

1182
01:59:24,127 --> 01:59:27,290
Are you going to be okay alone?

1183
01:59:30,366 --> 01:59:32,027
How big can it be?

1184
01:59:39,809 --> 01:59:40,969
Damn!

1185
01:59:58,561 --> 01:59:59,653
Damn.

1186
02:00:48,978 --> 02:00:50,570
Oh, this is gonna hurt.

1187
02:01:20,343 --> 02:01:22,470
Gonna be sore in the morning.

1188
02:01:42,298 --> 02:01:44,027
She's got no pulse.

1189
02:01:45,168 --> 02:01:46,829
She's not breathing.

1190
02:01:57,780 --> 02:01:59,179
Liz?

1191
02:01:59,515 --> 02:02:01,813
l was so foolish.

1192
02:02:33,850 --> 02:02:35,147
Red.

1193
02:02:42,425 --> 02:02:44,086
ln the dark...

1194
02:02:47,664 --> 02:02:49,723
...l heard your voice.

1195
02:02:54,570 --> 02:02:56,333
What did you say?

1196
02:02:58,441 --> 02:02:59,999
l said, ''Hey...

1197
02:03:00,910 --> 02:03:03,140
...you on the other side...

1198
02:03:04,981 --> 02:03:06,642
...let her go.

1199
02:03:08,484 --> 02:03:10,008
Because for--

1200
02:03:16,959 --> 02:03:19,291
For her l'll cross over.

1201
02:03:22,699 --> 02:03:25,361
And then you'll be sorry.''

1202
02:03:45,855 --> 02:03:48,449
What makes a man a man?

1203
02:03:48,758 --> 02:03:51,420
A friend of mine once wondered.

1204
02:03:52,061 --> 02:03:56,122
Is it his origins?
The way he comes to life?

1205
02:03:56,599 --> 02:03:58,430
I don't think so.

1206
02:03:58,601 --> 02:04:00,535
It's the choices he makes.

1207
02:04:00,703 --> 02:04:03,001
Not how he starts things...

1208
02:04:03,172 --> 02:04:06,300
...but how he decides to end them.

1209
02:06:14,203 --> 02:06:17,297
Hey, guys? l'm still here.

1210
02:06:20,443 --> 02:06:21,774
Hello?
