慢點好嗎 邁克?你搞得我不舒服
Hey, slow down, Mike, okay? You're making me sick.

3
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,890
如果不是你害我們遲到 我會慢點的
I would slow down if you hadn't already made us late.

4
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,680
我們沒遲到好嗎?是你太緊張
We're... We're not late, okay? You're just anxious.

5
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,100
不 我緊張是因為你害我們遲到
No, I'm anxious 'cause you made us late.

6
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,400
我下半生一定不會和你一起這樣做
I'm not doin' this with you in the next phase of our lives.

7
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,650
你必須尊重我的時間
You're gon' respect my time.

8
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,160
我的肚子
My stomach. My stomach.

9
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,240
邁克 馬上在那家店前停車
Hey, Mike, look, pull over at that store right there.

10
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,580
我需要薑汁汽水
I need a ginger ale.

11
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,620
我們沒時間買薑汁汽水 老兄
Look, we don't have no time to get no ginger ale, man.

12
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,460
別這樣 邁克 我不舒服
Come on, Mike, I'm sick.

13

我覺得我快要吐了
I feel like I'm gonna throw... throw up.

15

Are those dogs fresh?

22
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,840
昨天才擺出來的
I put 'em on yesterday.

Gotta go, gotta go.

27
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,940

Don't be takin' your time.

28

Yeah, my man.

29
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,700
打開收銀機
Hey, open the register.

30
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,490
不 馬上!
No, no, no. Now!

31
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,490
先生 你選錯日子了
Sir, today is not the day.

32
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,620
閉嘴!
Shut the fuck up!

33

看 如果我不在15秒之內上車
Look, if I'm not in that car in 15 seconds,

34
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,630
有個脾氣暴躁的男人會進來 我們都完蛋了
there's a very surly man that's comin' in here and we both are fucked.

35
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,210
馬克斯 別動
Marcus. Hey, don't fuckin' move.

36
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,840
過去!
The fuck over there!

37
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,680
邁克 我跟這人說了我必須走了
'Ey, Mike, I told this guy I had to go.

38
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,510
櫃檯上那是彩虹糖嗎 馬克斯?
Is that Skittles on the counter, Marcus?

39
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,390
他花了很久時間賣我薑汁汽水
Well, he was takin' a long time with the ginger ale.

40
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,680
不對 他進來時就馬上拿了薑汁汽水
That is incorrect. He grabbed that ginger ale the second he came in here.

41
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,850
是熱狗嗎 馬克斯?
A hot dog, Marcus?

42
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,230
你根本不該吃那鬼東西
You're not supposed to be eatin' that shit.

43
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,270
這不是我的 邁克 是你的
This is not mine, Mike. Yes, it is.

44
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,820
你別多管閒事
Mind your business with your tattletaling ass.

45
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,200
大家都閉嘴!
Everybody shut the fuck up!

46
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,660
先生 你必須把武器放下
Sir, I'm gonna need you to lower your weapon.

47
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,780
不然你來拿我的武器吧
Come take my weapon, then, motherfucker.

48
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,490
別跟他作對
Don't antagonise him.

49
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,740
馬克斯 上車
Marcus, get in the car.

50
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,160
邁克 他拿槍指著我的頭
Mike, he has a gun to my head.

51
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,830
你想對付他 還是我?
Wanna deal with him, you wanna deal with me?

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,590
抱歉 先生 我必須走了
Sorry, sir, but I gotta go.

53
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,680
你不必向他開槍 邁克
You didn't have to shoot him, Mike.

54
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,270
上車
Get in the car.

55
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,270
打911
Call 911.

56
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:34,850
你們不是警察?
Aren't you the police?

57
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,690
絕地戰警: 生死與共

58
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,530
別人眼裏的你
Other people look at you

59
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,240
看到的是量身定制的西裝 汽車 手錶
and see the tailored suits, the cars, the watches.

60
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,330
我們相識時 那一切都不存在
I met you without any of that.

61
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,330
一絲不掛 基本上是赤身裸體
Stripped, basically naked...

62
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,710
那是90%我嫁給你的原因
which is 90% of why I'm marrying you.

63
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,260
我在你最低谷時遇見了你
I met you at your lowest.

64
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,300
你中了槍
You'd been shot.

65
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,350
但你內心的火
But there was a fire in you that was...

66
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,180
是非凡的
...extraordinary.

67
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,900
我發誓要用餘生來煽動那股火焰
And I vow to spend the rest of my life fanning that flame.

68
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,820
現在我宣佈
I now pronounce you...

69
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,150

太好了!

我好喜歡
I love it.

73
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,800
他在中槍後與治療師結婚是有道理的
You know, it kinda makes sense that he married his therapist after he got shot.

74
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,720
我喜歡他一點 心理健康非常重要
I love that for him. Mental health is super important.

75
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,350
那是他的物理治療師
Well, it was his physical therapist.

76

市長先生
Mr Mayor.

78
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,560
說早了就不靈了 我仍然只是個卑微的美國律師
Oh, not yet. Don't jinx it. I'm still just a lowly US Attorney.

79
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,480
我一直在關注你的工作

00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,570
你們就是金童玉女
I mean, the definition of a power couple right there.

83
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,830
我去幫你拿飲料 好
I'll grab you a drink. Okay.

84
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,160
你想要什麼嗎?不 不需要 謝謝
Can I get you anything? No, I'm good, thank you.

85
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:18,210
一直以來 我都以為你至死都是單身漢
And all this time, I thought you were a terminal bachelor.

86
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,500
這一次我自己也始料不及
I... I... I even surprised myself with this one.

87
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,800
我想你一直沒遇見對的人
Yeah, I guess you just hadn't met the right one.

88
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,970
那時候我還有待成長
I had some growing up to do.

89
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,430
當時你已經50歲了
You were 50.

90
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,010
好
Okay.

91
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,440
我得為他所說的一切預先道歉
I'm gonna pre-apologise for whatever he says.

95
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,570

00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,600
哇 感覺已經有五年了
Oh, wow. Felt like it was five years.

140
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,730
我處於海洋的底部
I was in the basement of the ocean.

141
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,020
我所有的煩惱都消失了
All my bullshit was gone.

142
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,810
唯有自由
Just freedom.

143
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,150
還有完全充滿愛 邁克
And full body love, Mike. Full body love.

144
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,320
好
Okay.

145
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,700
不如你
Why... Why... Why don't you...

146
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,820
以愛讓你全身從邊緣回來好嗎?
...love your full body back from the ledge, please?

147
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,280
沒什麼好怕的
Nothing to be scared of.

148
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,370
我的時間還沒到 寶貝
It's not my time, baby. It's not my time.

149
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,540
伯內特先生!
Mr Burnett!

150
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,290
我看著他
Hey, I got him.

151
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,920
他只是
He's just...

152
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,010
我不知道他到底在幹嘛
I don't know what the fuck he's doing.

153
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,890
但我看著他了 我們沒事
But I got it. I got him. We're good. We are good.

154
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,390
我們很好!
We are great! 'Ey...

155
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,430
邁阿密!
Miami!

156
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,930
305一輩子!
305 for life!

157
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,060
唰唰!
Kakow!

158
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:14,150
停 你那東西會閃瞎別人的眼睛
All right. Just stop. You gon' put somebody's eye out with that thing, man.

159
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,360
我在喚醒我的原始能量 邁克
I'm bringing the thunder, Mike. I get it.

160
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,440
喚醒能量
Bringing the thunder.

161
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,360
好 就是這樣
All right. There you go.

162
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,070
來抱抱
Oh, man. Bring it in.

163
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,990
我以為我已經失去你了 兄弟
Thought I lost you, brother.

164
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,240
你的人生少不了我
Couldn't lose me if you tried.

165
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,000
你知道你的屁股露出了吧?
You know your ass is out, right?

166
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,500
大家的屁股都露出來了 邁克
Everybody's ass is out, Mike.

167
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,080
嘿
Hey.

168
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,960
一場暴風雨要來了
There's a storm coming.

169
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,590
不 不是那種暴風雨
No. Not that kind of storm.

170
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,090
你會經受考驗
You're gonna be tested.

171
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,180
事情會變得糟糕
Things are gonna get bad,

172
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,970
你將不得不做出一個非常艱難的選擇
and you're gonna have to make a really hard choice.

173
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,190
你只需記住 你很厲害
Just know you're good.

174
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,460
這是我的私人時間 麥格拉斯先生
This is my private time, Mr McGrath.

175
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,920
請問有什麼能幫到你的嗎?
How may I help you?

176
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,930
我要你轉一些錢 你的錢?
I need you to move some money. Your money?

177
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,720
其實是你老闆的 我要販毒集團現金
Your boss's, actually. I need it to be cartel cash.

178
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,640
不到兩千萬
Just under 20 million.

179
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,690
回溯那賬戶從2004年到2020年1月的
Backdated series of transfers beginning 2004, ending January 2020...

180
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,560
一系列
into...

181
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,940
轉賬
...that account.

182
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,980
以已故康拉德霍華德警監的名義
In the name of the late Captain Conrad Howard.

183
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,150
我有負責物流的人
I have people who can handle logistics.

184
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,870
我只需要你的登錄信息
I really just need your log-in credentials.

185
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,120
我為什麼要給你這些?
And why would I give you those?

186
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:51,990
天啊!
Oh, my God!

187
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,130
過來 親愛的
Come here, darling.

188
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,960
來
Come on.

189
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,550
過來
Come here.

190
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:09,800
面部識別

191
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,060
手機無法轉賬
You can't transfer funds from a phone.

192
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,320
親愛的 怎麼了?
Hey, honey, what's going on?

193
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,190
她們互相認識嗎?
Do they know each other?

194
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,570
親愛的 誰在你身邊?
Honey, who's there with you?

195
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,200
好!親愛的?
All right, all right! Honey--

196
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,130
轉賬開始了
Here we go.

197
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,420
資金轉移

198
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,710
轉至:康拉德霍華德

199
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,710
他們會為此殺了你
They'll kill you for this.

200
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,550
他們不會知道事情的經過
They're not even gonna know this happened.

201
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:53,470
你的女友聽見你和你太太的電話
Your girlfriend heard you on the phone with your wife

202
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,350
發現你根本沒打算和她離婚
and realised you were never gonna divorce her.

203
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:59,140
她一怒之下開槍射殺了你
And in a fit of passion, she shot you.

204
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,820
你的保鏢試圖介入 但已經來不及了
Your bodyguard tried to step in, but he was too late.

205
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,950
當她意識到她那恐怖的行為
And realising the horror of her actions...

206
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,160
她自殺了
she took her own life.

207
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,240
不要!
No!

208
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,880
親愛的 你在幹什麼?
Honey, what are you doing?

209
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,380
兩星期前你才心臟病發作 沒錯
You had a heart attack two weeks ago. Exactly.

210
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:32,680
他們稱其為寡婦製造者是有原因的 你該留在醫院 寶貝
They call it a widow-maker for a reason. You need to be in the hospital, baby.

211
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,890
我嘗試說過他了
Hey, I tried to told his ass, T.

212
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,980
顯然 他已經是成年人了 他獲准自行出院
Apparently, he's an adult. He was allowed to sign hisself out.

213
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,810
寶貝 別這樣 我一刻也無法忍受離開你
Hey, babe. Look, come on. I couldn't take one more second away from you.

214
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:47,190
我體內的支架讓我血脈噴張
All these stents in me got my blood flowing.

215
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:50,110
我在回家途中 好吧
I'm on D way. All right, now.

216
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,950
拜託 那是我的電話
Ey. Ey. Come on, man. That's my phone.

217
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,450
我愛你 馬克斯 我們10分鐘後到
I love you, Marcus. We'll be there in 10.

218
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,540
好的 寶貝 愛你
All right, babe. All right. Love you.

219
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,330
嘿 邁克
Hey, Mike.

220
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,210
我沒打算告訴你
I wasn't even gonna tell you this...

221
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,420
但我們不是第一次了
but this ain't the first time we done this.

222
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,210
我們時常同車 你是什麼意思?
We ride together all the time, what you mean?

223
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,550
不 我是說我們的靈魂
No, I'm talking about our souls.

224
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,630
我們曾一起同車 但我看到了全部 邁克
You know, we've ridden together, but I saw it all, Mike.

225
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:16,010
我們注定攜手同行 已經做了好幾輩子的生死搭檔
We're bound. And we have been for lifetimes.

226
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:20,680
我們並不總是叫邁克和馬克斯 但我們的靈魂不曾改變
We haven't always been Mike and Marcus, but we've always been us.

227
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,770
你在說什麼?
What you talking 'bout?

228
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:27,070
我們是靈魂伴侶
We're soulmates.

229
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:29,990
是 是的
Yup. Yeah.

230
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:31,780
不
Naw.

231
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:36,330
我認為的靈魂伴侶看起來有點不同
Yeah, I kind of... I saw my soulmate looking a little different than that.

232
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,580
邁克 你被困在肉體裏
See... See, Mike, you stuck in the physical.

233
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,540
靈魂沒有雞雞
Souls don't have dicks.

234
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,660
我蠻肯定我的靈魂有雞雞 馬克斯
I'm pretty sure my soul has a dick, Marcus.

235
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,090
看吧?就是這些廢話 所以我們才被困住
See? That's that shit right there. That's why we're stuck.

236
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,380
我本來也沒打算告訴你這個
You know, I wasn't gonna tell you this shit either,

237
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,680
但我的靈魂比你的先進多了
but my soul is more advanced than your soul.

238
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:58,260
我不是說你的靈魂很笨
It's not that your soul is stupid.

239
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,390
知道嗎?
You know?

240
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:04,310
只是你比較像是嬰兒靈魂 知道嗎?
It's just that you're more like a baby soul. You know?

241
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,810
而我比較像是母親的靈魂
And I'm more like a mother soul.

242
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,730
我只想給你餵奶
And I just gotta suckle ya.

243
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,780
知道嗎?讓你吸奶
You know? Put you on that titty.

244
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,400
知道嗎?
You know?

245
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,910
你覺得你的大腦缺氧多久了?
Hey. How long you think your brain went without oxygen?

246
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,040
爸爸!爸爸回來了
Daddy! Daddy's home.

247
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,040
寶貝!寶貝 你回來了 我的家人呢?我的家庭
Baby! Oh, baby, you're back. Where my family? My family.

248
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,420
嗨 寶貝
Hey, baby.

249
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,550
小馬克斯!
Little Marcus!

250
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:36,720
跟奶奶和爺爺說嗨
Say hi to Pop-pop. Say hi to Grandad.

251
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,720
我非常想念!你看你 女人
I missed you so-Look at you, woman.

252
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,720
不 別這樣 看著我 寶貝
No, come on, look at me, baby.

253
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:49,230
我們得讓他們冷靜下來
We're gonna have to hose them down.

254
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,940
好 我們知道了
All right. All right, we get it. We get it.

255
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,530
放點冰在你的內褲什麼的
Put some ice in your drawers or somethin'.

256
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,360
真好笑
That's funny.

257
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,780
你感覺好嗎 馬克斯?
Are you feeling good, Marcus?

258
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,700
我一生中從未感覺如此好過
I never felt better in my life.

259
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,250
馬克斯 我太想你了 親愛的 但你必須休息
Oh, Marcus, I missed you so much, honey, but you need to get some rest.

260
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,750
不 寶貝 我需要你
Oh, no, baby, I need you.

261
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,880
讓我去補充一些電解質 好的 寶貝 給我一個吻
Just let me get some electrolytes. Okay, baby. Give me a kiss.

262
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,180
我爸爸怎麼了?
So, what's going on with my dad?

263
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,930
他赤裸地站在屋頂上
Well, he was on the roof naked...

264
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,980
他還說他去了海床
and he said he had been at the basement of the ocean.

265
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,810
"神奇鷹嘴豆"?
"Amazing Chickpeas"?

266
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,810
還有 他說我有個很笨的嬰孩靈魂
Oh, and he said I have a stupid baby soul

267
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,610
也沒有雞雞
with no penis.

268
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,360
你們必須和他談談

269
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,360
嘿 雷吉 是 長官
Hey, Reggie. Yes, sir.

270
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,030
你吃了我的零食?沒有 長官
Did you eat my snacks? No, sir.

271
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,490
我正期待著我的零食 雷吉
I was looking forward to my snacks, Reggie.

272
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,040
親愛的

273
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,750
你知道嗎?你該去找份工作

274
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,540
我是一名美國海軍陸戰隊員 長官
I'm a US Marine, sir.

275
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,130
那麼你該被調派出去
Well, then you need to deploy.

276
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,880
我們剛從也門回來
You know, we just got back from Yemen.

277
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,960
謝謝你為國效力
Thank you for your service.

278
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,630
你以為我死了 對嗎?死了?
You thought I was dead, didn't you? Dead?

279
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,140
有一件事你不知道 雷吉
One thing you don't know, Reggie.

280
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,390
我在這安了一台監控 沒錯
I got a camera up in here. Yeah.

281
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,480
特麗莎!
Theresa!

282
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,900
是醫生吩咐的 馬克斯 你要嚴格節食 無鹽 無糖 無脂肪
It's the doctor's orders, Marcus. You're on a strict diet. No salt, no sugar, no fats.

283
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,900
不能有壓力 吵鬧聲 消耗體力
No stress, no loud noises, no physical exertion.

284
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,070
你隨便坐下就是了
Just sit your ass down somewhere, man.

285
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,370
告訴他 邁克
Tell him, Mike.

286
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,740
還有 親愛的 我和你一起做 現在我們是素食者
And, honey, I'm doing it with you. We're now vegetarians.

287
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,250
素食者?看著我
Vegetarians? Look at me.

288
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:31,000
你看我這體魄 寶貝 我現在宛如新生
Look at all this man, baby. I'm brand new.

289
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
我需要動物糖分來生存
I need animal sugars to survive.

290
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,050
寶貝
Well, baby...

291
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,090
我留了沙拉給你
I have a salad for you.

292
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,170
沙拉?!
A salad?

293
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:43,550
特麗莎 看來一切在你掌控之中 我的任務也完成了
Hey, T, looks like you got this under control. My tour of duty is done.

294
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,140
再見 克莉斯丁 再見 邁克 再見 兩位
Bye, Christine. Bye, Mike. Bye, guys.

295
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,480
邁克 等一下
Hey, Mike. Wait up. Wait up, wait up.

296
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,730
你打算做什麼?你能幫我跑腿嗎?
What you about to do? Can you run a quick-quick for me?

297
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,400
好 你需要什麼?
Yeah, what you need?

298
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,030
我會給你$1000買一些彩虹糖
I'll give you $1,000 for some Skittles.

299
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,110
馬克斯 我不會買糖給你
Marcus, I am not buying your ass no candy, man.

300
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:04,910
好 $2000 邁克 買叮噹蛋糕 這就是我的最終報價
Okay, $2,000, Mike, for some Ding Dongs. And that's my final offer.

301
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:07,740
你別想有叮噹了
I think you're gonna be Ding Dong-less...

302
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,330
就如我的靈魂一樣
like my soul.

303
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,280
你總是帶走我愛的人
You always take whoever I love.

304
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,950
我是邁克·勞瑞警探
This is Detective Mike Lowrey.

305
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,040
警監倒下了
The Captain is down.

306
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,620
他是我兒子
He's my son.

307
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,960
你的家庭一團糟 邁克
You got a fucked up family, Mike.

308
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:21,400
突發新聞 司法部一直對邁阿密警察局的貪污問題進行調查
The Department of Justice has been investigating the corruption in the Miami Police Department.

309
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,950
現在我們擁有可靠的情報
And we now have credible intelligence

310
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,320
當年是康拉德霍華德警監指揮這些人員
that Captain Conrad Howard was directing these elements

311
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,490
與販毒集團協調
in coordination with the cartels.

312
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,460
不 我沒興趣 大概的時間
No, I'm not interested in approximately what time.

313
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,630
我只要知道確實 時間 明白嗎?
I need to know exactly what time, do you understand?

314
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,880
你一直知道這件事?
You knew about this?

315
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,340
我兩個星期前才知道
I found out two weeks ago.

316
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,930
記者會 真的嗎?
A press conference. Really?

317
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,220
我很遺憾你們通過這種方式得知
I'm sorry about the way you had to find out.

318
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,930
但考慮到你們的密切關係 我們的密切關係?
But given your closeness-Our closeness?

319
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:53,560
如果沒有霍華德警監 你們誰也沒有工作
Neither one of y'all would have a job if it wasn't for Captain Howard.

320
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,390
麗塔 你知道事情不是這樣的
Rita, you know this is not true.

321
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,440
坦白說 我不知道
Honestly, I don't.

322
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,570
調查發現了新的證據
The investigation has turned up new evidence.

323
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,780
邁阿密執法部門多年來出了不少岔子
Miami law enforcement's been a leaky ship for years now.

324
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,110
證人死亡 線人失蹤
Witnesses turn up dead, informants disappear.

325
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,160
事件看起來是隨機的 直到你匯總幾年內發生的事
Events appear random until you aggregate them over a period of years.

326
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,160
然後就會看見一種模式
Then a pattern emerges.

327
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,750
他是誰?
Who is this?

328
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:19,460
巴德格萊斯 聯邦調查局局長 此次調查組的領導
Bud Grice, FBI, heading up the JTF on this show.

329
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,670
這就是我
That's who I am.

330
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:24,010
我們知道有人在提供情報
Now, we knew someone was providing intelligence

331
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,510
給運毒品到南佛羅里達州的毒販
to a cartel moving product into South Florida.

332
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,260
我們只是不知道是誰
We just didn't know who.

333
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:32,390
兩周前 一名毒品集團的銀行家被女友槍殺身亡
A cartel banker turned up dead two weeks ago, shot by his girlfriend.

334
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,810
他們找到一部手機 上面有霍華德的聯繫方式
They found a phone with Howard's contact on it.

335
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:39,190
與毒販多年的溝通 還有海外銀行賬戶信息
Years of communication with the cartel, account references offshore.

336
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,020
在霍華德的名下有數百萬美元
Millions in Howard's name.

337
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,320
通過這些證據 終於可以給那貪腐的混蛋定罪了
Final piece we needed to nail that dirty motherfucker.

338
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,990
格萊斯!噢 哇 聽我說
Grice! Oh, whoa. Hey, hey, let me holler at you.

339
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,620
你知道他倒下時我就在他身邊 對嗎?
You know I was with him when he went down, right?

340
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,040
你再說他貪腐試試
Call him dirty one more time.

341
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:54,910
你有種就說
I dare you.

342
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,290
我們知道還有其他人和他一夥 我們也會找到他們
We know he had others who were with him. We're gonna find them too.

343
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,380
和他一夥的人是我
I was with him.

344
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,550
現在就給我上手銬 我當時和他在一起 邁克
Put the cuffs on me right now. I was with him. Mike.

345
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:08,050
不 這些混蛋認為他死了 無法替自己辯護
No, these motherfuckers think that just 'cause he's dead and can't defend hisself,

346
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:11,260
就把所有問題推到他身上 毀了他的傳奇
they gon' dump all this shit on him, burn his legacy.

347
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,930
有我在就不行
Not on my watch.

348
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:20,350
我是朱迪霍華德 美國法警
This is Judy Howard, US Marshals.

349
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,690
我知道我在這裏沒有管轄權
I realise I have no jurisdiction here.

350
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:24,360
但出於職業禮貌
But as a professional courtesy,

351
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,450
我想申請瞭解針對我父親的指控的來源
I'd like to request visibility into the sources of the allegations against my father.

352
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,740
朱迪
Judy.

353
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,450
我們會解決這問題的 好嗎?
We're gonna figure this shit out, all right?

354
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,540
凱莉還好嗎?
How's Callie?

355
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,330
你覺得呢 邁克?
How do you think, Mike?

356
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,870
我們都在同一條船 朱迪
We're on the same team here, Judy.

357
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,750
當然不是 邁克
Like hell we are, Mike.

358
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:45,590
如果不是你的混蛋兒子 我爸爸應該還活著
My dad would still be alive if it weren't for your bastard son.

359
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,670
朱迪
Judy...

360
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:49,380
如果我在街上見到他 我以我父親發誓
If I ever catch him out on the street, I swear on my father

361
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,430
我會殺了他
I will put him down.

362
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,350
我們走吧
Come on. Come on, man. Come on.

363
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,730
邁阿密警局

364
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,640
接下來該怎麼辦?
So, what's our next move?

365
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,310
他們說他和毒販合作 我們去問毒販吧
They said he was working with the cartel. Let's ask the cartel.

366
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,610
聯邦監獄 佛羅里達州中部

367
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,870
你好嗎?
How you doin'?

368
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,910
這裏是監獄
It's prison.

369
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,290
是的
Yeah.

370
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,880
聽好 我們需要你的幫忙
Look. We need your help.

371
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,710
他們說霍華德警監貪污
They're saying that Captain Howard was dirty.

372
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,420
你是否有情報?
Do you know anything about that?

373
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:32,050
這個情報能讓我減刑多少?我還在爭取
How much time I get off for this one? I'm still working on that.

374
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:35,640
我在告訴你 我需要你的幫忙
This is me telling you that I need you.

375
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:41,020
我需要知道霍華德警監是否與販毒集團合作
I need to know if Captain Howard was working with the cartels.

376
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:45,690
沒有
No.

377
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,400
他正在調查那些有合作的人
He was onto the ones that were.

378
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,030
所以他被追殺
So he got greenlit.

379
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,200
等等 不
Wait, no.

380
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,410
不 霍華德警監被殺是因為他在你母親的暗殺名單上
No, Captain Howard was killed because he was on your mother's hit list.

381
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,410
他是被加上去的
He was added to it.

382
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,250
你們的人希望看起來像我們做的一樣
Your people wanted it to look like us.

383
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:05,500
你們希望他死去
Your people wanted him dead.

384
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,840
你說"我們的人"是什麼意思?
Whatchu mean, "our people"?

385
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,510
你應該小心
You should be careful.

386
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,970
你在玩遊戲 但你連規則都不知道
You're playing a game and you don't even know the rules.

387
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:16,140
你那邊有卑鄙的玩家 你亂說
There's dirty players on your side. That's bullshit.

388
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,300
等等 是誰?
Wait, who?

389
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,600
我見過他一次
I saw him one time.

390
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:26,730
你能認出他嗎?是的
Can you ID him? Si.

391
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,230
給我名字
Give me a name.

392
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,650
我不知道他的名字
I don't know his name.

393
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,240
我母親
My mother.

394
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,450
她就是與他對接的人
She's the one who dealt with him.

395
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,450
我就知道我們該讓那巫女活著
I knew we should have kept that damn witch alive.

396
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:39,620
馬克斯
Marcus.

397
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,000
願她安息
May she rest in peace.

398
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,160
老兄
Dude.

399
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,170
嘿 老闆
Hey, boss.

400
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:52,800
邁阿密市警察局

401
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,430
我們的線人在聯合特遣部隊檔案中 拿到了霍華德的所有記錄
Our man on the inside got all of Howard's records in the JTF file.

402
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:58,180
電腦 手機 文件 一切所有
Computers, phones, files, all of it.

403
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,600
我們知道霍華德曾調查我們的行動
Well, we know Howard was onto our operation.

404
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,140
我們只是不知道他查到多少 別錯過任何線索
We just don't know how much he had. We need to make sure we got every trace.

405
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,520
很好
That's beautiful.

406
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,810
嘿 老闆
Hey, boss.

407
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,770
都是紙質文件 到目前為止都沒問題
It's all the paper files. They're clean so far.

408
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:12,570
兩個手機沒問題 他辦公室電腦是空的
Two phones had nothing. His office computer was empty.

409
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,190
他很小心 但是?
He was careful. But?

410
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,410
但他的舊個人筆記本電腦加密程度較弱
But his old personal laptop had weak encryption.

411
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,620
有了
Here we go.

412
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,120
網絡故障

413
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,210
你說「我們」是什麼意思?
Shit. We tripped a fail-safe.

414
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:27,330
你是"我們"是什麼意思?
The fuck you mean, "we"?

415
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,210
某些東西被發送了
Something was sent.

416
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,130
給誰?
To who?

417
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,670
短信[已發送] 現在正在追蹤電話
Tracing the phone now.

418
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,260
霍華德警監

419
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,560
搞什麼?
What the hell?

420
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,640
他正在從另一世界給我們發短信
He's texting us from the other side.

421
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,810
不 他沒有 馬克斯
No, he's not, Marcus.

422
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,900
如果你看到這個
If you're seeing this...

423
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,070
我大概已經死了
I'm probably dead.

424
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,570
該死!
Fuck!

425
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,160
我真倒霉
Fuck me.

426
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,030
在我開始之前
Before I begin...

427
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,530
我想說一件事:
I wanna say one thing:

428
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:05,160
我正讓你陷入致命的危險
I'm putting you in mortal danger.

429
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,500
各位
Boys...

430
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,460
我們組織內有內奸
we got rats in our walls.

431
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:13,460
但我必須確保你們是我的壞孩子
But I gotta make sure you're my bad boys.

432
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,550
可樂瓶巨人就是關鍵
The Coke-bottle giant is the key.

433
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,340
什麼?
What?

434
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,010
別相信任何人
Don't trust anybody.

435
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,390
那是什麼?什麼意思?"可樂瓶巨人"
What's that? What does that mean? "The Coke-bottle giant."

436
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,020
弗萊徹
Fletcher.

437
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,900
完了
Oh, shit.

438
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,440
就是他們
These are the guys.

439
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,080
我們應該向這些混蛋開一槍 一次性解決它
We should put a bullet in these motherfuckers. Be done with it once and for all.

440
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,000
林茨 我愛你 任由你處置他們是最好的了
Lintz, I love you. I'd like nothing more than to let you loose on them.

441
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,580
但更多死去的警察對我們沒有任何好處
But extra dead cops doesn't do us any favours here.

442
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,630
持續監視他們 看看他們是否有所行動
Keep them under constant surveillance and see if they make a move.

443
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,590
弗萊徹的倉庫就在那條巷子
Fletcher's warehouse is right down that alley.

444
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,800
邁克 我沒打算告訴你這件事
Mike, I wasn't even gonna tell you this.

445
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,680
那就別告訴我
Then don't tell me.

446
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,810
不 你一定要聽 這很重要
No, you gotta hear this. This is big.

447
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,100
我死不了
I can't die.

448
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:11,850
什麼?
What?

449
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,940
我死不了
I cannot die.

450
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:17,990
幾周前你在我的婚禮上死得還不錯
Motherfucker, you did a pretty good job of dying at my wedding a couple weeks ago.

451
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,610
但我沒死
But I didn't.

452
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,820
看吧
Watch.

453
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,280

00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:35,670
停
Hey, stop, stop.

458
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:38,380
馬克斯!
Hey, hey! Marcus!

459
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,720
你這是瘋了嗎?
What are you, some kind of moron?!

460
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,180
停
Stop, stop, stop.

461
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,180
警察!停車!
Police! Stop!

462
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,140

慢點!
Slow down!

464
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,940
斑馬線!
Crosswalk!

465
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:58,860
跟我說話
Talk to me.

466
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,900
你要相信 邁克
You gotta trust, Mike.

467
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,070
相信自己 相信宇宙
Trust yourself. Trust the universe.

468
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,990
你夠了 馬克斯
Stop that shit, Marcus.

469
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:09,120
我的時間還沒到 邁克
It's not my time, Mike.

470
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,540
好 你是說如果我對你的臉開槍
Oh, okay. So you're saying that if I shoot you in your face,

471
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,250
你是說你不會死
you're saying that you won't die.

472
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,630
命運注定你不會朝我臉上開槍
Fate dictates that you won't shoot me in the face.

473
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:21,550
我是說你說了
I'm saying... I'm... I'm saying that you saying

474
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:25,800
如果我對你的臉開槍 你不會死?
that if I shoot you in your face, are you saying you won't die?

475
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,350
命運不做假設 邁克
Fate doesn't deal in hypotheticals, Mike.

476
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,140
我要報警了
I'm gonna call the police.

477
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,730
他們已經到了 女士 別多管閒事
They're already here, ma'am. Mind your business.

478

到海灘去吧
Just go to the beach.

479
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:38,980
別再胡鬧了 馬克斯
Stop that shit, Marcus.

480
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:43,150
看吧?你把槍收起來了

他把槍收起來了
He's putting his gun away.

482
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:54,000
邁克
Ooh, Mike.

00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,800
專心點
Focus, man.

484
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:03,920
我稱這地方為黑人想像的創意空間
Yeah, I call this place, you know, Creative Space for Black Imagination.

485
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,390
弗萊徹
You know that... Fletcher.

486
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,180
我的天
Oh, my God.

487
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,600
謝謝你
Thank you.

488
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,430
這到底是什麼地方?
What the hell is this place?

拜託 你才不是藝術家
Please, you ain't no damn artist.

491
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:21,860
你們要什麼?霍華德警監
What do you guys want? Captain Howard.

492
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:25,700
是 很遺憾聽到他的遭遇 他改善了我的人生
Yeah. I was sorry to hear what happened to him. He helped turn my life around.

他叫我們找你談
He told us to talk to you.

494
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:29,030
好 跟我談
Okay. Talk to me.

495
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,580
我剛剛就和你談了 那就說你該說的話
I just talked to you. Then say what you're supposed to say.

496
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,370
我已經說了我該說的話 你沒有
I said what I'm supposed to say. You didn't.

我不能說我該說的 直到你說了你該說的為止
I can't say what I supposed to say until you say what you supposed to say.

502
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,930
直接告訴我們你該說的話
Fletcher, just tell us what you supposed to tell us.

503
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:52,260
笨蛋 聽好了
Dumbasses. Look.

504
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,230
霍華德警監正在調查一件大事
Captain Howard was onto something big.

505
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:59,650
他不相信你們這笨蛋會解決 所以他聯絡了我
He didn't trust that you dumb fucks would figure it out, so he contacted me.

506
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,940
因為你們很笨 而我是天才
Because you're stupid, and I'm a genius.

在一個會永遠活著的東西裏面

我不認為是我
I don't think so.

515
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,280
別動!

你以前有過恐慌發作嗎?
Have you ever had a panic attack before?

538
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:30,710
什麼?沒人恐慌發作
What? Ain't nobody have no damn panic attack.

539
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:35,590
你的血壓165/90了 出汗 噁心 看心理醫生並不丟人
You're at 165 over 90. Sweaty. Nauseous. There's no shame in getting counselling.

540

好 謝謝你的關心 兄弟
All right. Thank you. Appreciate you, brother.

做得好
Good job, man.

543
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,430
嘿 邁克
Hey, Mike.

544
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,350
你為什麼會恐慌?
What the hell you panicking about?

545
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:46,810
我不想說
I'm not speaking to you.

546
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,310
我做了什麼?
What'd I do?

547
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,110
你們兩個沒事吧?
You two all right?

548
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,820
邁克恐慌發作
Mike had a panic attack.

549
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,030
他沒有 邁克沒事
He didn't. Mike is fine.

550
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,320
發生什麼事?
What happened?

551
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,240
麗塔 你不會相信這件事 但我們收到一個信
Rita, you ain't gonna believe this shit. But we got a text--

552
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,620
一個線報 我們收到線報稱弗萊徹違反了假釋規定
A tip. We got a tip that Fletcher had violated his parole.

553
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,580
所以我們來這裏
So we came down here

554
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:09,830
顯然他陷入了一些與他無關的事
and obviously he was into some shit he ain't have no business.

555
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:11,080
是真的嗎 馬克斯?
Is that true, Marcus?

556
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,510
你知道我一直和邁克一起
Well, you know I was with Mike.

557
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:23,010
在所有人中 你怎麼會認為霍華德警監做不法之事
How could you, of all people, think Captain Howard was dirty.

558
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,680
我不希望這是真的
I don't want this to be true.

559
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,520
但做好自己的事 遵循證據對大家都有好處
But it would benefit all of us to do our jobs and follow the evidence.

560
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:33,060
你認為他蠢到把賬戶記在自己名下
And you think he was stupid enough to put accounts in his own name.

561
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,690
他是被陷害的 被誰?
He's being framed. By who?

562
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:37,530
這就是我們想要找出的答案
That's what we're trying to find out.

563
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,280
麗塔 拜託 你不會那麼傻
Rita, come on, you're smarter than this.

564
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,070
邁克 請別忘記你正和你的上司說話
Michael, please do not forget you're talking to your boss.

565
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,830
我在努力保護你
I'm trying to protect you here.

566
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:47,870
我們沒有兩個街區半徑的錄像
I got no footage for a two-block radius.

567
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:49,080
什麼?
What?

568
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,210
他們肯定毀了所有閉路電視和安保攝像頭
They must've killed all CCTV, all security cams.

569
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,290
我什麼也找不到
I got nothing.

570
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:56,170
至少他們沒拍攝到你的恐慌發作
At least they ain't film your panic attack.

571
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,760
各位
Hey, guys.

572
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,010
你恐慌發作了嗎?沒有
You had a panic attack? No.

573
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:06,100
你要的話 我能推薦一位好的輔導員 不用 東恩 謝謝
If you want, I can recommend a good counsellor. I'm good, Dorn. Thanks.

574
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,970
看 這是我拍的 一幀一幀看
Look, I shot this, went frame by frame.

575
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:11,350
看這個
Check it out.

576
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,310
好 不在這裏
All right. Not here.

577
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,610
東恩 關了它 好
Dorn, shut it down. Yeah.

578
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:16,980
我們走
Hey. Let's go.

579
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:21,360
這是什麼?
So, what is this?

580
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,740
我們不肯定
We're not exactly sure.

581
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:25,700
哇 哇
Whoa. Wow.

582
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,160
這就對了
There you go. There you go.

583
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:31,290
好 現在我知道是你們
All right, you fucks. Now that I know it's you...

584
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:33,210
是這樣的:
here it is:

585
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:39,130
我不知道最高涉及到哪個高層 但我們這邊有貪官
I don't know how high up it goes, but there's corrupt officials on our side.

586
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,840
而且他們和販毒團合作
And they're working with the cartel.

587
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,010
大約九年前 這一切開始變得很奇怪
This all started smelling funny about nine years ago.

588
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:46,800
我們準備突襲的那批毒品失蹤了
That shipment of coke we were about to raid went missing.

589
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,430
上頭一直阻擋我
You know, I kept getting shut down from above.

590
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:53,640
所以我找了已退休的桑切斯和魯伊斯
So I pulled Sanchez and Ruiz outta retirement.

591
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,270
我讓他們從旁調查
I had 'em working on the outside, you know?

592
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:58,940
一周後 他們在一場車禍中喪生
They were killed in a car crash a week later.

593
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,650
這讓我很震驚
That shook me up.

594
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:03,360
所以我從未讓你們倆插手
And it's why I never brought you two in.

595
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:07,240
你們原本可以救我 我卻擔心你們的安全 真丟臉
Well, shame on me for worrying about your asses when you coulda saved mine.

596
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,490
但現在由你們決定
But now it's up to you.

597
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,620
還記得2003年的逮捕行動嗎?
Remember the bust back in 2003?

598
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:16,080
142公斤搖頭丸?
314 pounds of ecstasy?

599
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:20,090
我收在儲存櫃 沒有記錄在案
Well, I held onto the storage unit, off the books.

600
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,960
那就是真正的文件所在的地方
That's where the real files are.

601
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,680
消滅這些混蛋所需的一切
Everything you need to exterminate these rat fucks.

602
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,800
都在裏面!
It's in there!

603
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,390
你們必須完成我無法做到的事
You're gonna have to finish what I couldn't.

604
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,810
拜託你們
Please.

605
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,390
拜託了 兩位
Please, boys.

606
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:33,480
你們是我最後的希望
You're my last hope.

607
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,560
2003年
2003.

608
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:42,320
那是海地人 佐伊龐德
That was the Haitians. Zoe Pound.

609
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:46,910
他們的儲物櫃在哪裏?
Where was their storage locker?

610
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,620
我不知道
I have no idea.

611
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:52,870
好 你們該去警察局調出我們的案卷原件檔案
All right. We need you guys to go down to the station and pull our original case files.

612
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,410
我們就能找出儲物櫃在哪裏
That'll tell us where the locker is.

613
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:58,130
低調並小心地做 我們不知道誰可以信任
Do it quietly and be careful. We don't know who we can trust.

614
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:00,130
這可是大件事
Shit, this is heavy, man.

615
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,130
我有些很重要的事要說
I just got something important to say.

616
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:05,050
我就直接說吧 澄清一下
I'm just gonna come out with it. Clear the air.

617
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,970
那個內奸不是我
The rat is not me.

618
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,510
謝謝你 東恩
Thanks for that, Dorn.

619
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,730
我覺得安全多了
I feel safer.

620
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:23,110
高度設防監獄活動操場

621
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,530
他們剛打算殺了我兒子
They just tried to kill my son.

622
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:58,870
因為阿曼多可以證明霍華德警監是無辜的
Because Armando can prove that Captain Howard was innocent.

623
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:01,040
警監去世前正在調查這些受賄的警官
Cap was onto these dirty players.

624
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,500
阿曼多告訴你的?
Armando told you that?

625
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,420
是的 這就是他們想殺死霍華德警監的原因
Yes. It's the reason they wanted Captain Howard dead.

626
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:08,130
阿曼多可以認出下令襲擊警監的人
Armando can ID the guy that ordered the hit on Cap.

627
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,210
有名字嗎?
He have a name?

628
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:12,510
沒有 但知道對方長什麼樣
No. But a face.

629
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:16,100
我知道你們可以做到 好嗎?
Listen, I know y'all can do this. All right?

630
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:20,980
轉移阿曼多 帶他去邁阿密 一個安全的地方
Just transfer Armando. Get him to Miami. Get him to a secure location.

631
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:24,650
我們審問他 拿到他的證詞 給他一些照片
We'll debrief him. We'll get his testimony. We'll get some pictures in front of him.

632
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,650
但請馬上去做
But please do it now.

633
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:30,240
這些人試圖掩飾事實 而且他們不會停手
These guys are tryin' to cover their asses and they are not gonna stop.

634
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,950
這是為了霍華德警監
Do it for Captain Howard.

635
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:40,160
對霍華德警監不利的證據確鑿無疑
Look, the evidence against Captain Howard is overwhelming.

636
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,620
如果我這樣做 都是為了你
If I'm doing this, I'm doing it for you.

637
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:48,300
好 我們轉移阿瑞塔斯吧
All right, let's transfer Aretas.

638
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:52,340
你陪他 把他帶到邁阿密的冰屋 審問他
You'll accompany him, get him to igloo here in Miami, do a debrief.

639
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:55,180
但我是因為相信你 才會冒這麼大風險
But I'm sticking my neck out and I'm trusting you.

640
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:58,890
如果他是騙人的 那我就完了
If he turns out to be bullshit, then it's gonna be my ass.

641
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:02,480
所以別把我害了 邁克
So don't screw me, Mike.

642
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,570
謝謝你
Thank you.

643
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,320
謝謝你
Thank you.

644
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:13,700
什麼事?
Yeah?

645
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,860
我們找到了佐伊龐德的儲物櫃
We found Zoe Pound's storage unit.

646
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,700
我們去拿文件 然後收藏在我的船屋
We'll go get the files then take them to my houseboat for safekeeping.

647
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,080
好 繼續 找到後告訴我
All right, stay on it. Let me know when you got it.

648
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,180
請交出你的槍支 槍械將於著陸後還給你
Please surrender your firearms. They will be returned to you upon touchdown.

649
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,870
你還好嗎?
You good?

650
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,280
非常好
Never been better.

651
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,990
大約需要45分鐘
It's about 45 minutes.

652
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,880
邁克 我沒打算告訴你
Mike, I wasn't even gonna tell you this...

653
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,710
但在我們在一起的前世之一
but in one of our previous lifetimes together...

654
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,630
你曾是一隻驢
you were a donkey.

655
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,140
而且我是你的主人
And I owned you.

656
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:21,390
你很固執 邁克
You were a stubborn ass, Mike.

657
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,970
你過去常咬人和吐口水
You used to bite and spit.

658
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:25,640
你很壞
You were nasty.

659
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:30,560
但我不是好主人 因為我總會打你
But I was a terrible owner, you know, because I used to beat you.

660
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,440
因為你不聽話
Because you wouldn't listen for shit.

661
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:36,860
也許我打得讓你感到羞恥 邁克
And maybe I beat some kind of shame into you, Mike.

662
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:40,490
現在我意識到我傷害了你的靈魂
And now I realise I was scarring your soul.

663
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,660
你錯過了午睡?
You miss your nap?

664
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:46,620
邁克 我在嘗試向你道歉
Mike, I'm trying to apologise to you.

665
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:49,960
你的小被子不在這裏 但你可以閉眼休息
We don't have your blankie, but you could just rest your eyes.

666
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,790
你當驢子時就是這樣 好吧
That's exactly how you was as a donkey. Mm-kay.

667
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:54,920
就是那副鬼樣子 我明白了
That's that shit there. I get it.

668
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,720
你需要我幫忙系安全帶嗎?
You need some help with your seat belt?

669
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,300
不用 驢子
No, Donkey.

670
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:04,220
嘿 布萊恩特 我是布朗森
Hey. Bryant, this is Bronson.

671
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,600
其他人之後還要回去
Other guys are on turnaround.

672
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,890
坐好
Take a seat.

673
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,120
怎麼了?
What's up?

674
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:49,850
自動駕駛儀
Read the lines.

675
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:52,900
讀出來 "美國法警724航班 我們有緊急情況
"US Marshal flight 724, we have an emergency.

676
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:57,570
我們的囚犯在邁阿密警察勞瑞和伯內特的幫助下越獄了
Our prisoner has escaped custody with the aid of Miami PD Lowrey and Burnett.

677
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:58,740
這裏有倒下的警員
There are officers down.

678
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,490
求救 他們衝著駕駛艙來了
Mayday, mayday. They are coming for the cockpit.

679
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:04,370
我重複 他們正在劫持CH-47
I repeat, they are hijacking the CH-47.

680
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:06,580
請所有地面單位回應"
All ground units please respond."

681
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:21,630
把勞瑞的槍給我 收到
Give me Lowrey's gun. Copy.

682
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,100
快走!
Go, go!

683
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,310
去找勞瑞
Get Lowrey.

684
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:40,150
我們走!
Let's go!

685
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,560
我們不懼暴風雨 王八
We welcome the storm, motherfu--!

686
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:53,730
把我從這該死的牢籠裏救出來!
Get me out of this fucking cage!

687
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:55,940
馬克斯!
Marcus!

688
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:58,560
邁克!
Mike!

689
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:18,630
太重了!
It's too heavy!

690
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:20,040
別放手!
Don't let go!

691
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:02,090
抓住駕駛桿!
Grab the stick!

692
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,590
你怎麼會開飛機?
Where the hell you learn how to fly?!

693
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,590
我是個毒販 向右!
I'm a drug dealer, man. To the right!

694
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:56,520
他用了我的槍
He was using my gun.

695
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:59,020
他們究竟是怎麼登上美國法警直升機的?
How the hell did they get on a federal transport?

696
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,520
我們必須分頭行動
We need to split up.

697
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,310
我們要在一起
We're gonna stay together.

698
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:04,690
誰說的?
Says who?

699
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:08,110
我不是在問你
I'm not asking you.

700
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:10,240
我在告訴你 我們要在一起
I'm telling you. We're stayin' together.

701
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,610
別擋我的路
Fuck outta my way.

702
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:14,120
嘿 哪裏 放開我
Hey. Where--? Get the fuck off me.

703
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,700
喂!
Hey! Hey!

704
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:16,790
聽好
Look.

705
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:21,460
你是唯一能指證幕後主使的人!
You are the only person who can identify whoever is doing this!

706
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:26,550
我們活下去的唯一方法 就是先抓住他們
The only way that any of us stays alive is if we get them before they get us.

707
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:29,260
根本沒有我們!
There's no us! There is no us!

708
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:30,760
該死
Damn.

709
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,840
勞瑞的基因還真是讓人頭大
That Lowrey DNA is a bitch.

710
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,760
你倆的勁兒都這麼大
Y'all some strong motherfuckers.

711
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:40,520
好 這樣吧 大家放鬆 我數到三
Okay. Now, look, everybody unflex. On three.

712
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,440
一!二!
One! Two!

713
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:44,350
就是這樣
There you go.

714
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:50,650
霍華德警監給我們留下了文件 這些文件會告訴我們是誰幹的
Captain Howard left us files that's gonna tell us who's doin' this.

715
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,780
都在東恩那裏
Dorn has 'em.

716
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:54,660
我們只需要回到邁阿密
We just have to get back to Miami.

717
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:58,490
你最好別拖慢我
You better not slow me down.

718
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,910
丟了你們的電話
Lose your phones.

719
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:04,120
你跟緊我 否則我就讓你自生自滅
You keep up with me or I leave you in the dirt.

720
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,540
現在你已來到我的世界
You're in my world now.

721
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:22,640
邁克 我們必須想一想
Hey, Mike. Look, we gotta think about this.

722
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:26,940
我知道你要跟他走 因為他是你的"兒子"
I know you wanna move with him, you know, because he's your "son".

723
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,780
哇 別那樣說
Whoa, whoa. Don't air quote that.

724
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:33,030
不 我沒有 我只是說我知道你在嘗試保護他
No, I didn't. I'm just sayin' I know why you tryin' to protect him.

725
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,240
因為他是"家人"
'Cause he "family".

726
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:39,240
你這樣做和剛剛沒什麼差
Hey. Movin' the air quotes down to your hips doesn't un-air-quote them.

727
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,290
就直說他是我兒子吧
Just say he's my son.

728
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:43,330
他是你兒子 不
He's your son. No, no.

729
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:47,580
手掌向上就像你試圖說噢 他其實不是我兒子
Palms up is like you tryin' to say, oh, he's not really my son.

730
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:51,630
噢 你兒子走掉了
Oh. Well, your son's gettin' away.

731
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:52,920
混蛋
Shit.

732
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,850
如果你的人在執行某任務 最好通知我們
If your men are on some kind of op, you might wanna pull us in.

733
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:06,520
不然 這對他們來說不太好
Otherwise, it doesn't look good for them.

734
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:10,070
朱迪
Judy.

735
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:13,070
屍體的身份都確認了?對 但有三人下落不明
You ID the bodies? Roger. We got three unaccounted for.

736
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,200
勞瑞 伯內特和阿雷塔斯
Lowrey, Burnett and Aretas.

737
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,780
這些混蛋 該死
Motherfuckers. Fucking--!

738
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:19,950
見鬼
Shit.

739
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,490
好 聽好了!
All right. Listen up!

740
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:25,960
我們有三名嫌疑人 他們都攜帶武器 而且很危險
We have three suspects, armed and dangerous, out there.

741
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,420
給我把他們抓回來
And I want them back.

742
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,250
我們走!
Let's go!

743
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:32,710
等等 朱迪
Hold on. Judy.

744
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:34,590
三個 嫌疑人?
Three suspects?

745
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:36,340
你覺得這裏發生什麼事?
What do you think is happening here?

746
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:38,930
你覺得呢?
What do you think?

747
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:41,510
播放音頻
Play the audio.

748
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:45,480
美國法警724航班 我們有緊急情況
US Marshal flight 724, we have an emergency.

749
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:49,310
我們的囚犯在邁阿密警察勞瑞和伯內特的幫助下越獄了
Our prisoner has escaped custody with the aid of Miami PD Lowrey and Burnett.

750
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:51,520
有警官倒下 求救
There are officers down. Mayday, mayday.

751
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:55,530
不是吧 你不會相信邁克和馬克斯會這樣做
Come on, you can't possibly believe Mike and Marcus would do this.

752
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:59,450
你自己說的 勞瑞一心想讓兒子出獄
Nah, you said it. Lowrey was obsessed with getting his son out of prison.

753
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:01,120
別急 朱迪
Slow down, Judy.

754
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,540
這裏不是邁阿密 塞卡達
This isn't Miami, Secada.

755
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:07,210
這些都是我的逃犯 現在全世界都是我的管轄範圍
These are my fugitives and right now the whole world is my jurisdiction.

756
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:09,710
你們認識了一輩子 你怎麼能這麼說?
You've known them your whole life. How can you even suggest--?

757
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:12,340
我認為這是邁克和馬克斯策劃的嗎?
Do I think that Mike and Marcus planned this?

758
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,420
也許不是
Probably not.

759
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:17,130
但當涉及到家人時 人們會做他們通常不會做的事
But people do things they wouldn't normally do when family's involved.

760
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:19,590
根據我的經驗 無辜的人不會逃跑
In my experience innocent men don't run.

761
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:23,260
我們能不能先分析 你能不能做好自己的工作?
Can we stop and think before-Are you capable of doing your job?

762
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:24,770
因為我必須繼續調查
'Cause I need to move on.

763
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,520
他們還活著
They survived.

764
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:33,570
什麼意思?
What the fuck you mean, they survived?

765
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:37,150
現場沒有屍體 美國法警將其視為搜捕行動
No bodies on site. US Marshals are treating it as a manhunt.

766
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:41,320
這些人就是死不了
These guys just refuse to die.

767
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,280
他們是通緝犯
They're wanted men.

768
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,870
執法部門和媒體現在是我們的朋友
Law enforcement and media are our friends now.

769
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:49,580
三名逃犯的追捕行動
A manhunt for three fugitives

770
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:51,580
在南佛羅里達州引起了軒然大波
is sending shock waves across South Florida.

771
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:54,290
彈道報告與從屍體中找到的子彈相符
Ballistic reports have matched the bullets recovered from the bodies...

772
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:57,970
鑒於最近發生的事件 您打算退出市長競選嗎?
Are you planning on dropping out of the mayor's race in light of the recent events?

773
00:52:57,970 --> 00:52:59,800
目前搜捕工作正在進行中
The manhunt is currently underway.

774
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:04,050
聯邦調查局正在協助美國法警逮捕這些人
The FBI is assisting US Marshals in bringing these men in.

775
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:09,890
勞瑞 伯內特和阿雷塔斯應被視為有武器且危險
Lowrey, Burnett and Aretas should be considered armed and dangerous.

776
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:14,310
這些人殺害了其他專業執法人員
These are individuals who have killed fellow law enforcement professionals.

777
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:17,530
如果你看到什麼 請說出來
If you see something, say something.

778
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:19,950
在道上懸賞
Put a bounty on the streets.

779
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,620
通知城裏的每一個幫派 讓他們為之而戰
Get it to every gang in the city and let them fight for it.

780
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:28,370
五百萬
Five mil.

781
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:31,290
我們去把這些混蛋抓起來
Let's go get these motherfuckers.

782
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,510
宇宙太瘋狂了 不是嗎?
The universe is crazy, ain't it?

783
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:44,640
看我們
Look at us.

784
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:49,140
今早起床時沒人料到我們會走到這一步吧
I bet none of us thought when we woke up today this is where we'd be.

785
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:51,730
你離開了監獄
You outta jail.

786
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:53,600
我倆要進監獄了
We goin' to jail.

787
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,270
命運真幽默
This shit is special.

788
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:57,980
邁克?
Mike?

789
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:01,740
你有什麼想對阿曼多說的嗎?
Is there anything you would like to say to Armando?

790
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,320
你怎麼那樣說呢?沒有
Fuck you talkin' to me like that? No.

791
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:07,120
邁克 就是現在 向你兒子說出來
Mike, this is a moment. Express with your son.

792
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:17,540
對不起
I'm sorry.

793
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:20,760
這樣就對了嘛
That's what I'm talking about.

794
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,300
為了什麼?為了一切
For what? For everything, man.

795
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:27,350
看來我愛的人都遭遇壞事 所以
Seems like bad shit happens to anybody I love, so...

796
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:30,100
我開始想也許我被詛咒了
Startin' to think maybe I'm cursed.

797
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,390
我只是覺得
I just feel like...

798
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:33,890
也許是我連累了你
maybe I cursed you.

799
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:37,610
你沒有
You ain't fuckin' cursed me.

800
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:40,030
大家都會遇上不好的事
Bad shit happens to everybody.

801
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,650
從來都不是你一個人的事
Ain't always about you.

802
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:44,910
阿曼多
Hey, Armando.

803
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:49,450
不知我是否跟你說過 但幾個星期前我死了
I don't know if I told you this, but I died a couple of weeks ago.

804
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,040
很遺憾聽到這個消息
Sorry to hear about that.

805
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,920
噢 不 是我經歷過的最好的事情
Oh, no. The best thing that ever happened to me.

806
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,330
那次經歷太不可思議
Shit's wild.

807
00:54:56,330 --> 00:54:57,840
但你們?
But y'all?

808
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,500
你們就是我活過來的理由
Y'all the reason I came back.

809
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,670
嘿
Hey.

810
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:04,880

813
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:11,850

There you go, Armando.

814
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:14,100
這就對了 這就
There you go. There you--

815
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:16,650
你倆這逃犯當得太不合格了
Y'all are some terrible fuckin' fugitives.

816
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:21,940
你以為自己是馬克斯溫弗瑞嗎?
So, what are you, fuckin' Marcus Winfrey?

817
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:23,530
什麼?看吧?
What? Now, see?

818
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:26,200
你讓我們看起來很軟弱 好像不知如何逃跑
You makin' us look soft, like we don't know how to be on the run.

819
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:38,670
第二修正案才是美國自己的國土安全部

820
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:41,090
最好先給你找一身別的衣服穿
Better get you out of this.

821
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,510
喂!
Hey!

822
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:46,840
那孩子真固執 就像他父親一樣
That boy hard-headed. Chip off the old block.

823
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:08,820
瞧瞧我發現了什麼
Well, what we got here?

824
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,200
該隱 過來看看!
Hey, Cain, come take a look at this!

825
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:15,290
你們這些小伙子在幹什麼?
What are you boys doin'?

826
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:16,790
"小伙子"?
"Boys"?

827
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,250
你們在偷我們的衣服?看起來是這樣
Are y'all stealing our clothes? Looks like it.

828
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,920
種族主義
Fuckin' racism.

829
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,960
就因為我們是黑人 你們就覺得我們偷了你們的爛東西?
Y'all think just because we Black we stealin' your shit?

830
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,300
這些是我自己的黑人服裝
Now, these are my own Black clothes

831
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:31,850
今天我從我的黑人衣櫃穿上的
that I put on today from my own Black closet.

832
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:33,060
馬克斯!什麼?
Marcus! What?

833
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:34,220
看你衣服上寫了什麼
Look at your shirt.

834
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:39,480
純種白人男孩

835
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:43,070
這東西怎麼會在我的黑人衣櫃?
How'd this get in my Black closet?

836
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:47,070
不如你給我們唱一首瑞芭的歌
Why don't you boys sing us a little Reba song.

837
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:51,910
瑞芭?瑞芭?好
Reba? Reba? Oh, yeah.

838
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:54,080
請

839
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,620
那 因為他介紹瑞
That's-'Cause he put... He put me on to Reb--

唱你最愛的
Sing your favourite.

842
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,420
她有很多 因為她有許多熱門歌曲
Oh, she got plenty of them. 'Cause she got hits.

843
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:09,300
是快節奏的歌嗎?還是慢的?對 記得那首嗎?
Was it the up-tempo song? Or the slow jam? Yeah, yeah, remember the one?

844
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:12,050
是那首慢的 哥們 噢 好
It was the slow one, nigga. Oh, okay.

845
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:15,140
早上你傷害了我是的 因為她受傷了
You hurt me in the morning Yes, 'cause she was hurt.

846
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:17,430
晚上你傷害了我對了
You hurt me at night Yes, yes.

847

但我已改變改變
But I've changed Changed

848

我很堅強 我是個女人

849
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:23,310
我是個堅強的黑女
I'm a strong Black wom--

850
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,730
我是個堅強的女人
I'm a strong woman

851
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:26,860
是的 因為她不是黑人
Yeah, 'cause she's not Black.

852
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,700
然後
And then...

853
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,450
你該怎麼辦?
What you gonna do?

854
00:57:32,570 --> 00:57:34,160
你該怎麼
What you gonna d--?

855
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,830
那不是瑞芭的歌
That ain't no Reba song.

856
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:39,250
這是她的混音帶裏的
It's from her mixtape.

857
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,340
混蛋!
Goddamn it!

858
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,760
對不起!我們會還回來!
We're sorry! We'll bring it back!

859
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:56,680
我們沒有因為我們是黑人而偷你的東西!
We're not stealing your shit because we Black!

860
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:12,320
你是否愛過她?
Did you ever love her?

861
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,660
什麼?
What?

862
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:18,330
我媽媽 你是否愛過她?
My mother. You ever love her?

863

我肯定愛過她
I definitely loved her.

865
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,670
然後你出賣了她
And then you sold her out.

866
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:29,000
我做錯了
I made some mistakes.

867
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:30,630
我也是你的錯誤
Like me.

868
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:34,340
你知道我不是 等等 阿曼多
You know that is not what I was trying-Now wait a damn minute, Armando.

他正在努力彌補
He's trying to make up for it.

870
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:37,850
他不欠你什麼
He don't owe you a damn thing.

871
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:41,350
好 等等 馬克斯 你太嚴厲了
All right, hold on. Hold on, Marcus. You're just... You're being aggressive.

872
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:44,390
我做爸爸很久了 他必須聽的 邁克
I've been a dad a long time. He needs to hear this, Mike.

873
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:46,150
他需要一些嚴厲的愛
He needs some tough-ass love.

874
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:50,530
阿曼多 也許他確實虧欠了你
Armando. Maybe he does owe you something. Okay?

875
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:52,440
你媽被他騙了
Your mom being deceived by him.

876
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:56,370
你出生在佈滿謊言的監獄裏
You being born in prison, in a web of lies

877
00:58:56,370 --> 00:59:00,830
這使你變成一個冷血殺手
that turned your ass into a stone-cold fuckin' killer.

878
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:04,160

But this man, through it all, has been nothing but solid.

880
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:15,340
那是什麼年度之父的廢話
That's some father-of-the-year shit right there.

881
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:16,680
是嗎?
Is it?

882
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:22,390
你那很爛的教養方式把卡車弄壞了
Your wack-ass parenting broke the truck.

883
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,350

No, Mike. You know that woman's crazy.

887
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:32,440
沒錯 但她喜歡我
Yeah, but she likes me.

888
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,650
我不認為她有你想的那麼喜歡你
I don't think she likes you as much as you think.

889
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:37,360

1128
01:14:33,390 --> 01:14:35,100

1129
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:36,760
接電話
Pick up the phone.

1130
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:40,180
哇 邁克!
Whoa, Mike! Mike! Mike!

1131
01:14:46,270 --> 01:14:47,270
等一下
One second.

1132
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:53,200
凱莉
Callie.

1133
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:55,660
我在電視上看到 我媽媽正在追捕邁克叔叔
I saw it on TV. My mom is after Uncle Mike.

1134
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:58,660
他不可能做了他們所說的一切
There is no way that he did everything that they're saying.

1135
01:14:58,660 --> 01:14:59,870
親愛的
Sweetheart.

1136
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:04,120
一切會好起來的
Everything is going to be okay.

1137
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:06,710
知道嗎?
Okay? Okay?

1138
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:20,310
喂?是我 離開房子
Hello? It's me. Get out of the house.

1139
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:24,020
凱莉和我一起 帶她走!馬上離開!
I've got Callie with me. Take her and go! Get out now!

1140
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:27,940
凱莉 到我後面去
Callie, get behind me.

1141
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:30,730
邁克
Mike.

1142
01:15:36,410 --> 01:15:37,700
克莉斯丁!
Christine!

1143
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:48,670
勞瑞先生
Mr Lowrey.

1144
01:15:50,210 --> 01:15:51,590
我在跟誰說話?
Who am I speaking to?

1145
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:54,420
我想你知道我是誰
I think you know who you're speaking to.

1146
01:15:55,090 --> 01:15:56,430
我要你兒子
I need your boy...

1147
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:01,060
以及你敬愛的警監所藏匿的所有證據
and whatever evidence your beloved captain had squirrelled away.

1148
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:04,690
用這些交換你的妻子
And for that, you can have your wife.

1149
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:07,100
稍後我會回電教你怎麼做
I'll call you back with instructions.

1150
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:10,110
混蛋
Aw, shit.

1151
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:13,440
該死的
Goddamn it.

1152
01:16:14,490 --> 01:16:15,490
我會去
I'll go.

1153
01:16:21,290 --> 01:16:22,830
讓我的生命有價值一些
Let my life be worth something.

1154
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:26,460
絕對不行
Never.

1155
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:30,340
絕對不行
Never.

1156
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:39,430
邁克
Mike.

1157
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:42,180
他已經知道了
He knew.

1158
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:43,640
什麼意思?
What do you mean?

1159
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:46,560
他已經知道我們會來
He knew we were comin' in.

1160
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,940
他已知道我們有霍華德警監的檔案
He knew we had Captain Howard's files.

1161
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,570
他知道我們認出他
He knew we had ID'd him.

1162
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:53,070
他怎麼會知道?
How?

1163
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:55,940
唯一與你交談過的人是麗塔
Only person you spoke to was Rita.

1164
01:16:57,110 --> 01:16:58,410
不是麗塔
It's not Rita.

1165
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:03,580
她對男人的品味也太差了
Damn, she got bad taste in men.

1166
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,530
未知來電

1167
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:07,710
司法部一直在調查邁阿密警察局的腐敗問題
Justice has been investigating the corruption in the Miami Police Department...

1168
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:10,420
有報告稱已故警監康拉德·霍華德
...with reports suggesting the late Captain Conrad Howard...

1169
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:11,630
喂?
Hello?

1170
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:14,050
指揮著這些人員與毒販協調
...was directing these elements in coordination with the cartels.

1171
01:17:14,050 --> 01:17:16,920
對霍華德的指控 間接針對勞瑞和伯內特
Allegations against Howard, which allude to include Lowrey and Burnett,

1172
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:22,180
包括幫助毒販將毒品運到佛羅里達州
and the operation range from helping cartels move the product into the state of Florida

1173
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:25,020
以及交出關鍵證人 銷毀證據
as well as giving up key witnesses, destruction of evidence,

1174
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:26,850
甚至謀殺同事
and even the murder of fellow officers.

1175
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:29,310
發生什麼事?我不知道
What's going on? I don't know.

1176
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:33,900
案件有了突破 我必須去警局
There's been a breakthrough in the case. I need to get down to the station.

1177
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:37,110
我要到那裏去
I'm gonna head down there.

1178
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:41,740
我跟你去
I'm coming with you.

1179
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:56,760
你在發短信給誰?
Who are you texting?

1180
01:17:57,670 --> 01:18:01,800
我需要和辦公室聯繫
Just... Just gotta get in touch with the office.

1181
01:18:02,890 --> 01:18:04,180
聯合部隊
JTF.

1182
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:06,140
必須通知大家
Gotta let everybody know.

1183
01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:15,650
親愛的 別這樣
Hey. Honey. Come on.

1184
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:18,070
親愛的 你在幹什麼?停手
Honey, what are you doing? Stop that.

1185
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:19,860
你在幹什麼?停手
What are you doing? Stop it.

1186
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:21,660
放開我 你在幹什麼?
Let go of me. What are you doing?

1187
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:23,280
還給我!
Give it back to me. Give it back!

1188
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:56,650
見鬼
Fuck!

1189
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:58,900
來
Hey, hey, come on.

1190
01:19:01,490 --> 01:19:02,570
你還好嗎?
You okay?

1191
01:19:02,570 --> 01:19:03,990
看手機
Look at the phone.

1192
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,630
你知道你完蛋了 對吧?
You know you done fucked up, right?

1193
01:19:22,130 --> 01:19:23,380
你沒事吧?
You all right?

1194
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:28,890
對不起
I'm sorry.

1195
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:32,390
沒什麼好抱歉的
Ain't got nothing to be sorry for.

1196
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:57,210
我們會找到她的 警監
We'll find her, boss.

1197
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:05,430
除了在場的人 我不相信任何人
I don't trust anybody that's not standing right here, right now.

1198
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:08,800
我們每多牽扯進來一個人
Every extra person that we involve

1199
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:11,890
都會增加他們知道我們要來的可能性
increases the likelihood that they know we're coming,

1200
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:16,560
這增加了克莉斯丁和凱莉
which increases the likelihood that Christine and Callie

1201
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,400
無法逃生的可能性
don't make it out of there.

1202
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:23,740
這意味著不要特警 法警和後援
That means no SWAT, no marshals, no backup.

1203
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:26,700
只有我們
It's just us.

1204
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:34,000
我從來沒想過事情會這樣發展
I never meant for it to go this way.

1205
01:20:34,790 --> 01:20:36,460
你認為事情會如何發展?
How did you mean it to go?

1206
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:40,960
9/11之後 沒有人關心毒品進入這個國家
After 9/11, nobody cared about drugs coming into this country.

1207
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:44,170
為了確保邊境安全 我們開始與毒販合作
So to secure the borders we started to work with the cartels.

1208
01:20:44,170 --> 01:20:48,010
他們隨時警告我們任何即將發生的恐怖活動
And they kept us informed about any terrorist activity coming our way.

1209
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:51,510
效果很好 從那以後我們就沒有再受到襲擊
And it worked. We haven't had an attack since.

1210
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:53,810
我們正在保護這個國家
We were protecting this country.

1211
01:20:53,810 --> 01:20:58,350
你殺害警察並通過將毒品帶入這個國家而致富
You were killing cops and getting rich putting drugs into this country.

1212
01:20:58,350 --> 01:21:00,730
麗塔 所以你才殺了霍華德
Rita. That's why you killed Howard.

1213
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:03,110
他盯上你 你要掩飾你的罪行
He was onto you. You wanted to cover your tracks.

1214
01:21:03,110 --> 01:21:05,400
不 是麥格拉思
No. That was McGrath.

1215
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:07,610
他失控了
He's out of control.

1216
01:21:07,610 --> 01:21:10,120
麗塔 先聽我的
Rita. Just take a second.

1217
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:13,200
我無意讓這一切發展到這個地步
I never meant for any of this to go this way.

1218
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:26,550
我想我只想知道你是否是真心的
I guess I just need to know if it was ever real.

1219
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:29,010
我一直都是真心的
It was always real.

1220
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:32,470
我慌了 失控了
I panicked. I lost control.

1221
01:21:33,140 --> 01:21:34,770
你是否愛過我?
Did you love me?

1222
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:36,060
是的
Yes.

1223
01:21:36,730 --> 01:21:38,140
我發誓
I swear.

1224
01:21:38,850 --> 01:21:40,440
那表示
Well, that means...

1225
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:41,610
很好 聲音樣本採集完成
We good. We got it.

1226
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:43,650
99%聲音匹配
99% voice match.

1227
01:21:45,070 --> 01:21:49,360
我完全不在乎 你這廢物
...absolutely nothing to me, you piece of shit.

1228
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:57,750
是我
Hey. It's me.

1229
01:21:58,370 --> 01:22:00,330
到底發生什麼事?
What the hell's going on?

1230
01:22:00,330 --> 01:22:02,080
你搞砸了 就是這回事
You screwed up is what's going on.

1231
01:22:02,210 --> 01:22:06,050
我們暴露了 到了那裏我會解釋
We've been compromised. I'll explain when I get there.

1232
01:22:06,050 --> 01:22:09,420
我們要轉移人質 古巴 長期禁錮
We're moving the hostages. Cuba. Long-term hold...

1233
01:22:10,090 --> 01:22:14,300
這樣在我們解決這個問題時 勞瑞 伯內特和阿雷塔斯就不敢輕舉妄動
to keep Lowrey, Burnett and Aretas quiet while we sort this out.

1234
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:17,600
我會帶來水上飛機 天一亮我就會到
I'm bringing a seaplane. I'll be there at first light.

1235
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:24,440
好 把這個地方收拾起來
All right, pack this place up.

1236
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:27,110
所有設備和人員準備搬遷
All equipment and personnel prepare to move.

1237
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:29,740
我們要將人質移出外國
We're moving the hostages out of the country.

1238
01:22:44,210 --> 01:22:45,710
你的手怎麼了?
What happened to your hand?

1239
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:56,810
他們稱之為哥倫比亞美甲
They call that a Colombian manicure.

1240
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:04,520
這酷刑的絕妙之處在於
What's so great about it

1241
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:07,070
它能讓你感受最大程度的痛苦
is it's the maximum amount of pain,

1242
01:23:07,070 --> 01:23:08,190
但又不會死去
but you don't die.

1243
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:16,660
所以現在你決定成為那個拿著鉗子的人
So now you've decided to be the one holding the pliers.

1244
01:23:18,370 --> 01:23:19,950
每個人都會崩潰
Everybody breaks.

1245
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,290
每個人
Everyone.

1246
01:23:22,870 --> 01:23:24,170
你丈夫
Your husband...

1247
01:23:24,790 --> 01:23:27,090
將會跪在我面前
is gonna kneel down in front of me...

1248
01:23:27,590 --> 01:23:29,510
並求我饒了你們的命
and beg for your lives.

1249
01:23:30,670 --> 01:23:33,180
然後你就會看著我殺掉他
And then you're gonna watch me kill him.

1250
01:23:36,090 --> 01:23:38,310
你不瞭解我丈夫
You don't know my husband.

1251
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:41,310
我們沒正式認識過 但是
Well, not officially, but...

1252
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:43,980
我期待再次和他見面
I look forward to seeing him again.

1253
01:23:56,660 --> 01:23:59,580
壞孩子

1254
01:24:05,330 --> 01:24:06,750

01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,130
壞孩子
Bad boys Bad boys

1256
01:24:16,930 --> 01:24:18,510
你打算怎麼做
Whatchu you gonna do

1257
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:20,180
對
Yeah.

1258
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:23,270
敵人朝你襲來時 你打算怎麼做
What you gonna do When they come for you

1259
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:29,270
這就夠了
That's enough, dawg. That's enough.

1260
01:24:29,270 --> 01:24:31,980
我們回頭再繼續唱
Okay, well, we'll circle back on that one.

1261
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:45,540
好 飛機準備好了 20分鐘後開始行動
All right. The plane is ready. We roll in 20.

1262
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:48,330
這是一座廢棄的遊樂園 應該沒有平民
It's an abandoned amusement park. There should be no civilians.

1263
01:24:48,330 --> 01:24:51,800
飛機將從南邊降落 在一側
Plane is gonna land from the south. On the one side.

1264
01:24:52,550 --> 01:24:55,050
馬克斯和我將在飛機上
Marcus and I will be on the plane.

1265
01:24:55,050 --> 01:24:58,760
阿曼多會在水中奮力前行 兩側
Armando's gonna make his way in the water. The two side.

1266
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:03,220
卡麗 麗塔 這條路是一進一出
Kelly, Rita. This road is one way in, one way out.

1267
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:05,060
你守著那條路
You're holding that road.

1268
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:08,810
東恩 你控制空中
Dorn, you're gonna control the air.

1269
01:25:08,810 --> 01:25:12,570
無人機在空中 干擾已激活 通訊安全
Drones in the air, jamming is active, comms are secure.

1270
01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:15,740
他們會以為洛克伍德正乘著飛機
As far as they know, Lockwood is on his way with the plane

1271
01:25:15,740 --> 01:25:18,240
將人質轉移到古巴
to move the hostages to Cuba.

1272
01:25:19,110 --> 01:25:22,490
當他們帶著人質靠近飛機時 就會很快被殺死
The second they get close to the plane with the hostages, it's quick kills.

1273
01:25:22,490 --> 01:25:24,290
消除所有威脅
Neutralise all threats.

1274
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:26,830
這些混蛋殺了很多好警察
These motherfuckers killed a lot of good cops.

1275
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:29,000
他們綁架了我的妻子和凱莉
They have my wife, they have Callie.

1276
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,960
他們襲擊了我們的家人

1277

今天我們不能輸

1278
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:37,260
嘿
Hey.

1279
01:25:38,470 --> 01:25:41,010
飛機一降落 只要你搞小動作
We get on the ground, you even flinch,

1280
01:25:41,010 --> 01:25:43,180
就會在0點24秒裏死去
you'll be dead in .24 seconds.

1281
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:44,600
我同意
I concur.

1282
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:48,560
我在外面的平台上有一人把風
I got one lookout on the platform outside.

1283
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:51,360
二號樓的屋頂上有一名狙擊手
I got one sniper on the roof of building two.

1284
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:53,020
讓我看看
Tee those up.

1285
01:25:55,820 --> 01:25:57,280
大家繼續前進
Everybody keep moving.

1286
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:59,360
那些是什麼?鱷魚
What are those? Gators.

1287
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:02,070
我以為這是一個廢棄的 鱷魚公園
I thought it was an abandoned gator park.

1288
01:26:02,070 --> 01:26:03,450
被人類遺棄
Abandoned by humans.

1289
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:05,700
其實這是一個古老的遊樂園
It's actually an old amusement park.

1290
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:09,120
它佔地10英畝 2017 年颶風"艾爾瑪"之後被廢棄
It sat on 10 acres, abandoned in 2017 after Hurricane Irma.

1291
01:26:09,670 --> 01:26:14,130
他們的主要景點是一隻名叫杜克的白化鱷魚
Their main attraction was an albino alligator named Duke...

1292
01:26:14,130 --> 01:26:17,630
他長16英尺 重900磅
...who was 16 feet long, 900 pounds.

1293
01:26:17,630 --> 01:26:20,220
"傳說它還在那裏"
"And legend has it he's still there."

1294
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:21,890
完了
Fuck that.

1295
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:38,240
阿曼多已經在他的位置
Armando's at his QTH.

邁克 能擊中嗎?

不行 我無法開槍
Negative. I do not have a shot. I do not have a shot.

1302
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:35,420
邁克 他就在那邊 我無法開槍
Mike, he's right there. I don't have it. I don't have it.

1303
01:27:42,380 --> 01:27:44,680
他們停下來了 為什麼停下來?
They stopped. Why'd they stop?

1304
01:27:58,320 --> 01:27:59,400
糟糕

邁克 馬上 現在就是你的機會

1309
01:28:20,090 --> 01:28:22,380
他們能看見他 他們知道我們在這裏
They can see him. They know we're here.

1310
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:27,090
我無法開槍 不行
I don't have it. Negative. Negative. Negative.

1311
01:28:27,090 --> 01:28:29,140
你一定要開槍
You gotta take the fuckin' shot.

1312
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:50,330
阿曼多暴露了
Armando's burnt.

1313
01:28:51,540 --> 01:28:54,120
該死 全面作戰 開始行動

Bad shit happens, but that doesn't mean you're bad.

1327

你是鄰里的大灰狼
You're the big bad wolf in the neighbourhood

1331
01:31:03,540 --> 01:31:06,000
不壞意味著壞 但壞就意味著好

1332
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:38,290
