1
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,380
Hey, slow down, Mike, okay? You're making me sick.

2
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,890
I would slow down if you hadn't already made us late.

3
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,680
We're... We're not late, okay? You're just anxious.

4
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,100
No, I'm anxious 'cause you made us late.

5
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,400
I'm not doin' this with you in the next phase of our lives.

6
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,650
You're gon' respect my time.

7
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,160
My stomach. My stomach.

8
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,240
Hey, Mike, look, pull over at that store right there.

9
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,580
I need a ginger ale.

10
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,620
Look, we don't have no time to get no ginger ale, man.

11
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,460
Come on, Mike, I'm sick.

12
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,500
You're freaking me out, okay?

13
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,420
I feel like I'm gonna throw... throw up.

14
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,630
I dare you, Marcus.

15
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,760
You got 90 seconds, all right?

16
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,720
Ginger ale and nothing else.

17
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,310
I am a grown-ass man, okay?

18
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,480
Just be nice.

19
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,860
Oh. Okay. 85 seconds.

20
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,090
Are those dogs fresh?

21
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,840
I put 'em on yesterday.

22
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,430
Well, give me one and put some relish and some mustard on that motherfucker.

23
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,260
Hook it up. Come on, hurry up.

24
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,350
No, that one right there. Yeah. Yeah, that right there. Hurry up.

25
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,440
Gotta go, gotta go.

26
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,940
Don't be takin' your time.

27
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:16,690
Yeah, my man.

28
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,700
Hey, open the register.

29
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,490
No, no, no. Now!

30
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,490
Sir, today is not the day.

31
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,620
Shut the fuck up!

32
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,620
Look, if I'm not in that car in 15 seconds,

33
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,630
there's a very surly man that's comin' in here and we both are fucked.

34
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,210
Marcus. Hey, don't fuckin' move.

35
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,840
The fuck over there!

36
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,680
'Ey, Mike, I told this guy I had to go.

37
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,510
Is that Skittles on the counter, Marcus?

38
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,390
Well, he was takin' a long time with the ginger ale.

39
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,680
That is incorrect. He grabbed that ginger ale the second he came in here.

40
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,850
A hot dog, Marcus?

41
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,230
You're not supposed to be eatin' that shit.

42
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,270
This is not mine, Mike. Yes, it is.

43
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,820
Mind your business with your tattletaling ass.

44
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,200
Everybody shut the fuck up!

45
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,660
Sir, I'm gonna need you to lower your weapon.

46
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,780
Come take my weapon, then, motherfucker.

47
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,490
Don't antagonise him.

48
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,740
Marcus, get in the car.

49
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,160
Mike, he has a gun to my head.

50
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,830
Wanna deal with him, you wanna deal with me?

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,590
Sorry, sir, but I gotta go.

52
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,680
You didn't have to shoot him, Mike.

53
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,270
Get in the car.

54
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,270
Call 911.

55
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:34,850
Aren't you the police?

56
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,530
Other people look at you

57
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,240
and see the tailored suits, the cars, the watches.

58
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,330
I met you without any of that.

59
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,330
Stripped, basically naked...

60
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,710
which is 90% of why I'm marrying you.

61
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,260
I met you at your lowest.

62
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,300
You'd been shot.

63
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,350
But there was a fire in you that was...

64
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,180
...extraordinary.

65
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,900
And I vow to spend the rest of my life fanning that flame.

66
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,820
I now pronounce you...

67
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,150
husband and wife.

68
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,570
You may kiss the bride.

69
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:27,740
Yes!

70
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,120
I love it.

71
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,800
You know, it kinda makes sense that he married his therapist after he got shot.

72
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,720
I love that for him. Mental health is super important.

73
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,350
Well, it was his physical therapist.

74
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,720
Congratulations, Michael. Rita. Thank you, thank you.

75
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,560
Mr Mayor.

76
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,560
Oh, not yet. Don't jinx it. I'm still just a lowly US Attorney.

77
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,480
I've been watching what you're doin'.

78
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,230
You got my vote. Thank you.

79
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,400
Congratulations to you.

80
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,570
I mean, the definition of a power couple right there.

81
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,830
I'll grab you a drink. Okay.

82
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,160
Can I get you anything? No, I'm good, thank you.

83
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:18,210
And all this time, I thought you were a terminal bachelor.

84
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,500
I... I... I even surprised myself with this one.

85
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,800
Yeah, I guess you just hadn't met the right one.

86
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,970
I had some growing up to do.

87
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,430
You were 50.

88
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,010
Okay.

89
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,440
I'm gonna pre-apologise for whatever he says.

90
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,150
Mike.

91
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,530
No, you know how it is. Don't... Marcus!

92
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,440
Marcus. Come... Let me get it out!

93
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,570
Come on, man.

94
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,740
Everything you have been through, man. Okay.

95
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,820
The witch. The Bruja.

96
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,280
The prostitute.

97
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,830
My sister. 'Member? You coulda told me about my sister, Mike.

98
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,370
You coulda told me that.

99
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:03,460
I would've embraced you, if that's who she was feeling.

100
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,960
I love you, Mike. No doubt.

101
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,420
You know, Cap would've loved to have been here to see this.

102
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,760
But you know what?

103
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,180
We got his daughter, Judy, and his granddaughter, Callie.

104
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,430
She wants to say something.

105
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,770
My grandad loved you guys.

106
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:26,650
And if he were here, he would have told you not to F this up.

107
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,610
That's what he would've said.

108
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,030
Yeah, he woulda said "Don't fuck it up."

109
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,280
Exactly.

110
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,830
Oh, excuse me.

111
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,200
'Ey.

112
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,080
Mike, you been my partner a long time.

113
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,670
Yes, sir.

114
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,290
Now he's gonna be your partner, Christine.

115
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,970
To Mike and Christine Lowrey.

116
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,510
For life! For life!

117
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:15,490
Go Marcus! Go Marcus! Go Marcus! Go Marcus!

118
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,130
Oh, shit.

119
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,930
What happened? What happened?

120
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,260
Marcus. Marcus!

121
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,430
What's the address?

122
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,850
Let me in, let me in, let me in. Back up.

123
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,940
This is Captain Rita Secada. I have an officer in cardiac arrest.

124
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,450
Come on, man.

125
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,790
It's not your time.

126
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,760
Marcus!

127
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,850
Marc-Marc--!

128
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,060
This guy.

129
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,410
Hey, buddy.

130
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,580
What you doing?

131
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,000
I spent my whole life being scared, Mike.

132
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,420
I wasted so much time.

133
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,880
Why... Why... Why don't you...Why don't you just step back from the edge a little bit, please.

134
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,420
What year is it?

135
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,430
It's Tuesday.

136
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,640
Same year your ass was wobbling in.

137
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,600
Oh, wow. Felt like it was five years.

138
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,730
I was in the basement of the ocean.

139
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,020
All my bullshit was gone.

140
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,810
Just freedom.

141
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,150
And full body love, Mike. Full body love.

142
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,320
Okay.

143
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,700
Why... Why... Why don't you...

144
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,820
...love your full body back from the ledge, please?

145
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,280
Nothing to be scared of.

146
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,370
It's not my time, baby. It's not my time.

147
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,540
Mr Burnett!

148
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,290
Hey, I got him.

149
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,920
He's just...

150
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,010
I don't know what the fuck he's doing.

151
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,890
But I got it. I got him. We're good. We are good.

152
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,390
We are great! 'Ey...

153
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,430
Miami!

154
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,930
305 for life!

155
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,060
Kakow!

156
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:14,150
All right. Just stop. You gon' put somebody's eye out with that thing, man.

157
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,360
I'm bringing the thunder, Mike. I get it.

158
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,440
Bringing the thunder.

159
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,360
All right. There you go.

160
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,070
Oh, man. Bring it in.

161
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,990
Thought I lost you, brother.

162
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,240
Couldn't lose me if you tried.

163
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,000
You know your ass is out, right?

164
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,500
Everybody's ass is out, Mike.

165
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,080
Hey.

166
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,960
There's a storm coming.

167
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,590
No. Not that kind of storm.

168
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,090
You're gonna be tested.

169
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,180
Things are gonna get bad,

170
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,970
and you're gonna have to make a really hard choice.

171
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,190
Just know you're good.

172
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,460
This is my private time, Mr McGrath.

173
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,920
How may I help you?

174
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,930
I need you to move some money. Your money?

175
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,720
Your boss's, actually. I need it to be cartel cash.

176
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,640
Just under 20 million.

177
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,690
Backdated series of transfers beginning 2004, ending January 2020...

178
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,560
into...

179
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,940
...that account.

180
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,980
In the name of the late Captain Conrad Howard.

181
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,150
I have people who can handle logistics.

182
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,870
I really just need your log-in credentials.

183
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,120
And why would I give you those?

184
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:51,990
Oh, my God!

185
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,130
Come here, darling.

186
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,960
Come on.

187
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,550
Come here.

188
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,060
You can't transfer funds from a phone.

189
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,320
Hey, honey, what's going on?

190
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,190
Do they know each other?

191
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,570
Honey, who's there with you?

192
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,200
All right, all right! Honey--

193
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,130
Here we go.

194
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,710
They'll kill you for this.

195
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,550
They're not even gonna know this happened.

196
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:53,470
Your girlfriend heard you on the phone with your wife

197
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,350
and realised you were never gonna divorce her.

198
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:59,140
And in a fit of passion, she shot you.

199
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,820
Your bodyguard tried to step in, but he was too late.

200
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,950
And realising the horror of her actions...

201
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,160
she took her own life.

202
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,240
No!

203
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,880
Honey, what are you doing?

204
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,380
You had a heart attack two weeks ago. Exactly.

205
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:32,680
They call it a widow-maker for a reason. You need to be in the hospital, baby.

206
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,890
Hey, I tried to told his ass, T.

207
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,980
Apparently, he's an adult. He was allowed to sign hisself out.

208
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,810
Hey, babe. Look, come on. I couldn't take one more second away from you.

209
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:47,190
All these stents in me got my blood flowing.

210
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:50,110
I'm on D way. All right, now.

211
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,950
Ey. Ey. Come on, man. That's my phone.

212
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,450
I love you, Marcus. We'll be there in 10.

213
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,540
All right, babe. All right. Love you.

214
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,330
Hey, Mike.

215
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,210
I wasn't even gonna tell you this...

216
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,420
but this ain't the first time we done this.

217
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,210
We ride together all the time, what you mean?

218
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,550
No, I'm talking about our souls.

219
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,630
You know, we've ridden together, but I saw it all, Mike.

220
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:16,010
We're bound. And we have been for lifetimes.

221
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:20,680
We haven't always been Mike and Marcus, but we've always been us.

222
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,770
What you talking 'bout?

223
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:27,070
We're soulmates.

224
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:29,990
Yup. Yeah.

225
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:31,780
Naw.

226
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:36,330
Yeah, I kind of... I saw my soulmate looking a little different than that.

227
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,580
See... See, Mike, you stuck in the physical.

228
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,540
Souls don't have dicks.

229
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,660
I'm pretty sure my soul has a dick, Marcus.

230
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,090
See? That's that shit right there. That's why we're stuck.

231
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,380
You know, I wasn't gonna tell you this shit either,

232
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,680
but my soul is more advanced than your soul.

233
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:58,260
It's not that your soul is stupid.

234
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,390
You know?

235
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:04,310
It's just that you're more like a baby soul. You know?

236
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,810
And I'm more like a mother soul.

237
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,730
And I just gotta suckle ya.

238
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,780
You know? Put you on that titty.

239
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,400
You know?

240
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,910
Hey. How long you think your brain went without oxygen?

241
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,040
Daddy! Daddy's home.

242
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,040
Baby! Oh, baby, you're back. Where my family? My family.

243
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,420
Hey, baby.

244
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,550
Little Marcus!

245
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:36,720
Say hi to Pop-pop. Say hi to Grandad.

246
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,720
I missed you so-Look at you, woman.

247
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,720
No, come on, look at me, baby.

248
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:49,230
We're gonna have to hose them down.

249
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,940
All right. All right, we get it. We get it.

250
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,530
Put some ice in your drawers or somethin'.

251
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,360
That's funny.

252
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,780
Are you feeling good, Marcus?

253
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,700
I never felt better in my life.

254
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,250
Oh, Marcus, I missed you so much, honey, but you need to get some rest.

255
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,750
Oh, no, baby, I need you.

256
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,880
Just let me get some electrolytes. Okay, baby. Give me a kiss.

257
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,180
So, what's going on with my dad?

258
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,930
Well, he was on the roof naked...

259
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,980
and he said he had been at the basement of the ocean.

260
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,810
"Amazing Chickpeas"?

261
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,810
Oh, and he said I have a stupid baby soul

262
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,610
with no penis.

263
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,360
Hey, Reggie. Yes, sir.

264
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,030
Did you eat my snacks? No, sir.

265
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,490
I was looking forward to my snacks, Reggie.

266
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,040
Honey.

267
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,750
You know what? You need to get a job.

268
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,540
I'm a US Marine, sir.

269
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,130
Well, then you need to deploy.

270
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,880
You know, we just got back from Yemen.

271
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,960
Thank you for your service.

272
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,630
You thought I was dead, didn't you? Dead?

273
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,140
One thing you don't know, Reggie.

274
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,390
I got a camera up in here. Yeah.

275
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,480
Theresa!

276
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,900
It's the doctor's orders, Marcus. You're on a strict diet. No salt, no sugar, no fats.

277
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,900
No stress, no loud noises, no physical exertion.

278
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,070
Just sit your ass down somewhere, man.

279
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,370
Tell him, Mike.

280
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,740
And, honey, I'm doing it with you. We're now vegetarians.

281
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,250
Vegetarians? Look at me.

282
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:31,000
Look at all this man, baby. I'm brand new.

283
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I need animal sugars to survive.

284
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,050
Well, baby...

285
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,090
I have a salad for you.

286
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,170
A salad?

287
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:43,550
Hey, T, looks like you got this under control. My tour of duty is done.

288
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,140
Bye, Christine. Bye, Mike. Bye, guys.

289
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,480
Hey, Mike. Wait up. Wait up, wait up.

290
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,730
What you about to do? Can you run a quick-quick for me?

291
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,400
Yeah, what you need?

292
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,030
I'll give you $1,000 for some Skittles.

293
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,110
Marcus, I am not buying your ass no candy, man.

294
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:04,910
Okay, $2,000, Mike, for some Ding Dongs. And that's my final offer.

295
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:07,740
I think you're gonna be Ding Dong-less...

296
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,330
like my soul.

297
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,280
You always take whoever I love.

298
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,950
This is Detective Mike Lowrey.

299
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,040
The Captain is down.

300
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,620
He's my son.

301
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,960
You got a fucked up family, Mike.

302
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:21,400
The Department of Justice has been investigating the corruption in the Miami Police Department.

303
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,950
And we now have credible intelligence

304
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,320
that Captain Conrad Howard was directing these elements

305
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,490
in coordination with the cartels.

306
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,460
No, I'm not interested in approximately what time.

307
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,630
I need to know exactly what time, do you understand?

308
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,880
You knew about this?

309
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,340
I found out two weeks ago.

310
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,930
A press conference. Really?

311
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,220
I'm sorry about the way you had to find out.

312
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,930
But given your closeness-Our closeness?

313
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:53,560
Neither one of y'all would have a job if it wasn't for Captain Howard.

314
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,390
Rita, you know this is not true.

315
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,440
Honestly, I don't.

316
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,570
The investigation has turned up new evidence.

317
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,780
Miami law enforcement's been a leaky ship for years now.

318
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,110
Witnesses turn up dead, informants disappear.

319
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,160
Events appear random until you aggregate them over a period of years.

320
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,160
Then a pattern emerges.

321
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,750
Who is this?

322
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:19,460
Bud Grice, FBI, heading up the JTF on this show.

323
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,670
That's who I am.

324
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:24,010
Now, we knew someone was providing intelligence

325
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,510
to a cartel moving product into South Florida.

326
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,260
We just didn't know who.

327
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:32,390
A cartel banker turned up dead two weeks ago, shot by his girlfriend.

328
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,810
They found a phone with Howard's contact on it.

329
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:39,190
Years of communication with the cartel, account references offshore.

330
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,020
Millions in Howard's name.

331
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,320
Final piece we needed to nail that dirty motherfucker.

332
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,990
Grice! Oh, whoa. Hey, hey, let me holler at you.

333
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,620
You know I was with him when he went down, right?

334
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,040
Call him dirty one more time.

335
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:54,910
I dare you.

336
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,290
We know he had others who were with him. We're gonna find them too.

337
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,380
I was with him.

338
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,550
Put the cuffs on me right now. I was with him. Mike.

339
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:08,050
No, these motherfuckers think that just 'cause he's dead and can't defend hisself,

340
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:11,260
they gon' dump all this shit on him, burn his legacy.

341
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,930
Not on my watch.

342
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:20,350
This is Judy Howard, US Marshals.

343
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,690
I realise I have no jurisdiction here.

344
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:24,360
But as a professional courtesy,

345
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,450
I'd like to request visibility into the sources of the allegations against my father.

346
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,740
Judy.

347
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,450
We're gonna figure this shit out, all right?

348
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,540
How's Callie?

349
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,330
How do you think, Mike?

350
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,870
We're on the same team here, Judy.

351
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,750
Like hell we are, Mike.

352
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:45,590
My dad would still be alive if it weren't for your bastard son.

353
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,670
Judy...

354
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:49,380
If I ever catch him out on the street, I swear on my father

355
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,430
I will put him down.

356
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,350
Come on. Come on, man. Come on.

357
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,640
So, what's our next move?

358
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,310
They said he was working with the cartel. Let's ask the cartel.

359
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,870
How you doin'?

360
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,910
It's prison.

361
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,290
Yeah.

362
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,880
Look. We need your help.

363
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,710
They're saying that Captain Howard was dirty.

364
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,420
Do you know anything about that?

365
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:32,050
How much time I get off for this one? I'm still working on that.

366
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:35,640
This is me telling you that I need you.

367
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:41,020
I need to know if Captain Howard was working with the cartels.

368
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:45,690
No.

369
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,400
He was onto the ones that were.

370
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,030
So he got greenlit.

371
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,200
Wait, no.

372
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,410
No, Captain Howard was killed because he was on your mother's hit list.

373
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,410
He was added to it.

374
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,250
Your people wanted it to look like us.

375
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:05,500
Your people wanted him dead.

376
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,840
Whatchu mean, "our people"?

377
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,510
You should be careful.

378
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,970
You're playing a game and you don't even know the rules.

379
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:16,140
There's dirty players on your side. That's bullshit.

380
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,300
Wait, who?

381
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,600
I saw him one time.

382
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:26,730
Can you ID him? Si.

383
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,230
Give me a name.

384
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,650
I don't know his name.

385
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,240
My mother.

386
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,450
She's the one who dealt with him.

387
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,450
I knew we should have kept that damn witch alive.

388
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:39,620
Marcus.

389
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,000
May she rest in peace.

390
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,160
Dude.

391
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,170
Hey, boss.

392
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,430
Our man on the inside got all of Howard's records in the JTF file.

393
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:58,180
Computers, phones, files, all of it.

394
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,600
Well, we know Howard was onto our operation.

395
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,140
We just don't know how much he had. We need to make sure we got every trace.

396
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,520
That's beautiful.

397
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,810
Hey, boss.

398
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,770
It's all the paper files. They're clean so far.

399
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:12,570
Two phones had nothing. His office computer was empty.

400
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,190
He was careful. But?

401
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,410
But his old personal laptop had weak encryption.

402
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,620
Here we go.

403
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,210
Shit. We tripped a fail-safe.

404
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:27,330
The fuck you mean, "we"?

405
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,210
Something was sent.

406
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,130
To who?

407
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,670
Tracing the phone now.

408
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,560
What the hell?

409
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,640
He's texting us from the other side.

410
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,810
No, he's not, Marcus.

411
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,900
If you're seeing this...

412
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,070
I'm probably dead.

413
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,570
Fuck!

414
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,160
Fuck me.

415
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,030
Before I begin...

416
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,530
I wanna say one thing:

417
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:05,160
I'm putting you in mortal danger.

418
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,500
Boys...

419
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,460
we got rats in our walls.

420
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:13,460
But I gotta make sure you're my bad boys.

421
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,550
The Coke-bottle giant is the key.

422
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,340
What?

423
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,010
Don't trust anybody.

424
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,390
What's that? What does that mean? "The Coke-bottle giant."

425
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,020
Fletcher.

426
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,900
Oh, shit.

427
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,440
These are the guys.

428
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,080
We should put a bullet in these motherfuckers. Be done with it once and for all.

429
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,000
Lintz, I love you. I'd like nothing more than to let you loose on them.

430
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,580
But extra dead cops doesn't do us any favours here.

431
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,630
Keep them under constant surveillance and see if they make a move.

432
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,590
Fletcher's warehouse is right down that alley.

433
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,800
Mike, I wasn't even gonna tell you this.

434
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,680
Then don't tell me.

435
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,810
No, you gotta hear this. This is big.

436
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,100
I can't die.

437
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:11,850
What?

438
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,940
I cannot die.

439
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:17,990
Motherfucker, you did a pretty good job of dying at my wedding a couple weeks ago.

440
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,610
But I didn't.

441
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,820
Watch.

442
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,280
Hey, Marcus.

443
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,790
Hey! Come on! Get out of the road!

444
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,540
Hey!

445
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:32,920
Hey! Marcus!

446
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:35,670
Hey, stop, stop.

447
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:38,380
Hey, hey! Marcus!

448
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,720
What are you, some kind of moron?!

449
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,180
Stop, stop, stop.

450
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,180
Police! Stop!

451
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,140
Hey! Bro!

452
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,350
Slow down!

453
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,940
Crosswalk!

454
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:58,860
Talk to me.

455
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,900
You gotta trust, Mike.

456
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,070
Trust yourself. Trust the universe.

457
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,990
Stop that shit, Marcus.

458
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:09,120
It's not my time, Mike.

459
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,540
Oh, okay. So you're saying that if I shoot you in your face,

460
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,250
you're saying that you won't die.

461
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,630
Fate dictates that you won't shoot me in the face.

462
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:21,550
I'm saying... I'm... I'm saying that you saying

463
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:25,800
that if I shoot you in your face, are you saying you won't die?

464
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,350
Fate doesn't deal in hypotheticals, Mike.

465
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,140
I'm gonna call the police.

466
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,730
They're already here, ma'am. Mind your business.

467
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,440
Just go to the beach.

468
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:38,980
Stop that shit, Marcus.

469
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:43,150
See? You're putting your gun away.

470
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,910
He's putting his gun away.

471
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:54,000
Ooh, Mike.

472
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,800
Focus, man.

473
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:03,920
Yeah, I call this place, you know, Creative Space for Black Imagination.

474
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,390
You know that... Fletcher.

475
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,180
Oh, my God.

476
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,600
Thank you.

477
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,430
What the hell is this place?

478
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:15,600
This is my studio gallery. I'm an artiste now.

479
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,310
Please, you ain't no damn artist.

480
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:21,860
What do you guys want? Captain Howard.

481
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:25,700
Yeah. I was sorry to hear what happened to him. He helped turn my life around.

482
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,610
He told us to talk to you.

483
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:29,030
Okay. Talk to me.

484
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,580
I just talked to you. Then say what you're supposed to say.

485
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,370
I said what I'm supposed to say. You didn't.

486
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:37,250
Then tell me what I'm supposed to say. I've said all I can say.

487
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,380
Fucking with us, beanstalk?!

488
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,630
Marcus! Come on!

489
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:44,420
Captain Howard saved my life. I'm not messing this up.

490
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:48,390
I can't say what I supposed to say until you say what you supposed to say.

491
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,930
Fletcher, just tell us what you supposed to tell us.

492
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:52,260
Dumbasses. Look.

493
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,230
Captain Howard was onto something big.

494
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:59,650
He didn't trust that you dumb fucks would figure it out, so he contacted me.

495
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,940
Because you're stupid, and I'm a genius.

496
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,610
So I protected the information in something.

497
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,410
In something beautiful.

498
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,210
Flex your face one more time. Flex it again!

499
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,130
I will blow your fucking head off.

500
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,800
Would you stop?! Come on.

501
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:29,430
In something that will live forever.

502
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,140
Did you shoot him?!

503
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,350
I don't think so.

504
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,280
Freeze!

505
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,700
Marcus. Marcus!

506
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,730
You hit?

507
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:24,820
Nah-ah.

508
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:27,480
Black jellybean. Nobody likes that shit.

509
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:34,580
Whoa.

510
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:43,080
Hey! Stop that stupid shit!

511
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,340
I'm not fucking with you! Stop!

512
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,850
No! No, no! No! No!

513
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,240
I don't give a fuck!

514
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,370
Marcus! No! No!

515
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,900
What are you doing?!

516
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,690
I got this! But you don't, though.

517
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:49,780
No. No!

518
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,360
Marc--!

519
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:57,700
Let's go! Let's move!

520
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,330
Marcus!

521
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,040
Burnett and Lowrey are moving north on 11th.

522
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,820
Miami PD! Go!

523
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:36,450
What are you doing?! I'm fightin' crime, baby!

524
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:37,530
Freeze!

525
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,100
Mike!

526
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:27,410
Have you ever had a panic attack before?

527
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:30,710
What? Ain't nobody have no damn panic attack.

528
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:35,590
You're at 165 over 90. Sweaty. Nauseous. There's no shame in getting counselling.

529
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,630
All right. Thank you. Appreciate you, brother.

530
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,590
Mike, let the man do his job.

531
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,930
Good job, man.

532
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,430
Hey, Mike.

533
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,350
What the hell you panicking about?

534
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:46,810
I'm not speaking to you.

535
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,310
What'd I do?

536
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,110
You two all right?

537
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,820
Mike had a panic attack.

538
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,030
He didn't. Mike is fine.

539
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,320
What happened?

540
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,240
Rita, you ain't gonna believe this shit. But we got a text--

541
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,620
A tip. We got a tip that Fletcher had violated his parole.

542
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,580
So we came down here

543
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:09,830
and obviously he was into some shit he ain't have no business.

544
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:11,080
Is that true, Marcus?

545
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,510
Well, you know I was with Mike.

546
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:23,010
How could you, of all people, think Captain Howard was dirty.

547
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,680
I don't want this to be true.

548
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,520
But it would benefit all of us to do our jobs and follow the evidence.

549
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:33,060
And you think he was stupid enough to put accounts in his own name.

550
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,690
He's being framed. By who?

551
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:37,530
That's what we're trying to find out.

552
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,280
Rita, come on, you're smarter than this.

553
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,070
Michael, please do not forget you're talking to your boss.

554
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,830
I'm trying to protect you here.

555
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:47,870
I got no footage for a two-block radius.

556
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:49,080
What?

557
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,210
They must've killed all CCTV, all security cams.

558
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,290
I got nothing.

559
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:56,170
At least they ain't film your panic attack.

560
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,760
Hey, guys.

561
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,010
You had a panic attack? No.

562
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:06,100
If you want, I can recommend a good counsellor. I'm good, Dorn. Thanks.

563
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,970
Look, I shot this, went frame by frame.

564
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:11,350
Check it out.

565
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,310
All right. Not here.

566
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,610
Dorn, shut it down. Yeah.

567
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:16,980
Hey. Let's go.

568
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:21,360
So, what is this?

569
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,740
We're not exactly sure.

570
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:25,700
Whoa. Wow.

571
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,160
There you go. There you go.

572
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:31,290
All right, you fucks. Now that I know it's you...

573
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:33,210
here it is:

574
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:39,130
I don't know how high up it goes, but there's corrupt officials on our side.

575
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,840
And they're working with the cartel.

576
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,010
This all started smelling funny about nine years ago.

577
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:46,800
That shipment of coke we were about to raid went missing.

578
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,430
You know, I kept getting shut down from above.

579
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:53,640
So I pulled Sanchez and Ruiz outta retirement.

580
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,270
I had 'em working on the outside, you know?

581
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:58,940
They were killed in a car crash a week later.

582
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,650
That shook me up.

583
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:03,360
And it's why I never brought you two in.

584
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:07,240
Well, shame on me for worrying about your asses when you coulda saved mine.

585
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,490
But now it's up to you.

586
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,620
Remember the bust back in 2003?

587
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:16,080
314 pounds of ecstasy?

588
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:20,090
Well, I held onto the storage unit, off the books.

589
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,960
That's where the real files are.

590
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,680
Everything you need to exterminate these rat fucks.

591
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,800
It's in there!

592
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,390
You're gonna have to finish what I couldn't.

593
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,810
Please.

594
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,390
Please, boys.

595
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:33,480
You're my last hope.

596
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,560
2003.

597
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:42,320
That was the Haitians. Zoe Pound.

598
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:46,910
Where was their storage locker?

599
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,620
I have no idea.

600
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:52,870
All right. We need you guys to go down to the station and pull our original case files.

601
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,410
That'll tell us where the locker is.

602
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:58,130
Do it quietly and be careful. We don't know who we can trust.

603
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:00,130
Shit, this is heavy, man.

604
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,130
I just got something important to say.

605
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:05,050
I'm just gonna come out with it. Clear the air.

606
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,970
The rat is not me.

607
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,510
Thanks for that, Dorn.

608
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,730
I feel safer.

609
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,530
They just tried to kill my son.

610
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:58,870
Because Armando can prove that Captain Howard was innocent.

611
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:01,040
Cap was onto these dirty players.

612
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,500
Armando told you that?

613
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,420
Yes. It's the reason they wanted Captain Howard dead.

614
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:08,130
Armando can ID the guy that ordered the hit on Cap.

615
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,210
He have a name?

616
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:12,510
No. But a face.

617
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:16,100
Listen, I know y'all can do this. All right?

618
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:20,980
Just transfer Armando. Get him to Miami. Get him to a secure location.

619
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:24,650
We'll debrief him. We'll get his testimony. We'll get some pictures in front of him.

620
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,650
But please do it now.

621
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:30,240
These guys are tryin' to cover their asses and they are not gonna stop.

622
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,950
Do it for Captain Howard.

623
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:40,160
Look, the evidence against Captain Howard is overwhelming.

624
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,620
If I'm doing this, I'm doing it for you.

625
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:48,300
All right, let's transfer Aretas.

626
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:52,340
You'll accompany him, get him to igloo here in Miami, do a debrief.

627
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:55,180
But I'm sticking my neck out and I'm trusting you.

628
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:58,890
If he turns out to be bullshit, then it's gonna be my ass.

629
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:02,480
So don't screw me, Mike.

630
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,570
Thank you.

631
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,320
Thank you.

632
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:13,700
Yeah?

633
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,860
We found Zoe Pound's storage unit.

634
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,700
We'll go get the files then take them to my houseboat for safekeeping.

635
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,080
All right, stay on it. Let me know when you got it.

636
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,180
Please surrender your firearms. They will be returned to you upon touchdown.

637
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,870
You good?

638
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,280
Never been better.

639
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,990
It's about 45 minutes.

640
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,880
Mike, I wasn't even gonna tell you this...

641
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,710
but in one of our previous lifetimes together...

642
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,630
you were a donkey.

643
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,140
And I owned you.

644
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:21,390
You were a stubborn ass, Mike.

645
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,970
You used to bite and spit.

646
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:25,640
You were nasty.

647
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:30,560
But I was a terrible owner, you know, because I used to beat you.

648
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,440
Because you wouldn't listen for shit.

649
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:36,860
And maybe I beat some kind of shame into you, Mike.

650
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:40,490
And now I realise I was scarring your soul.

651
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,660
You miss your nap?

652
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:46,620
Mike, I'm trying to apologise to you.

653
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:49,960
We don't have your blankie, but you could just rest your eyes.

654
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,790
That's exactly how you was as a donkey. Mm-kay.

655
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:54,920
That's that shit there. I get it.

656
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,720
You need some help with your seat belt?

657
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,300
No, Donkey.

658
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:04,220
Hey. Bryant, this is Bronson.

659
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,600
Other guys are on turnaround.

660
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,890
Take a seat.

661
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,120
What's up?

662
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:49,850
Read the lines.

663
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:52,900
"US Marshal flight 724, we have an emergency.

664
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:57,570
Our prisoner has escaped custody with the aid of Miami PD Lowrey and Burnett.

665
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:58,740
There are officers down.

666
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,490
Mayday, mayday. They are coming for the cockpit.

667
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:04,370
I repeat, they are hijacking the CH-47.

668
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:06,580
All ground units please respond."

669
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:21,630
Give me Lowrey's gun. Copy.

670
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,100
Go, go!

671
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,310
Get Lowrey.

672
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:40,150
Let's go!

673
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,560
We welcome the storm, motherfu--!

674
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:53,730
Get me out of this fucking cage!

675
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:55,940
Marcus!

676
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:58,560
Mike!

677
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:18,630
It's too heavy!

678
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:20,040
Don't let go!

679
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:02,090
Grab the stick!

680
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,590
Where the hell you learn how to fly?!

681
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,590
I'm a drug dealer, man. To the right!

682
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:56,520
He was using my gun.

683
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:59,020
How the hell did they get on a federal transport?

684
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,520
We need to split up.

685
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,310
We're gonna stay together.

686
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:04,690
Says who?

687
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:08,110
I'm not asking you.

688
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:10,240
I'm telling you. We're stayin' together.

689
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,610
Fuck outta my way.

690
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:14,120
Hey. Where--? Get the fuck off me.

691
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,700
Hey! Hey!

692
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:16,790
Look.

693
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:21,460
You are the only person who can identify whoever is doing this!

694
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:26,550
The only way that any of us stays alive is if we get them before they get us.

695
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:29,260
There's no us! There is no us!

696
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:30,760
Damn.

697
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,840
That Lowrey DNA is a bitch.

698
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,760
Y'all some strong motherfuckers.

699
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:40,520
Okay. Now, look, everybody unflex. On three.

700
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,440
One! Two!

701
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:44,350
There you go.

702
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:50,650
Captain Howard left us files that's gonna tell us who's doin' this.

703
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,780
Dorn has 'em.

704
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:54,660
We just have to get back to Miami.

705
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:58,490
You better not slow me down.

706
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,910
Lose your phones.

707
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:04,120
You keep up with me or I leave you in the dirt.

708
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,540
You're in my world now.

709
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:22,640
Hey, Mike. Look, we gotta think about this.

710
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:26,940
I know you wanna move with him, you know, because he's your "son".

711
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,780
Whoa, whoa. Don't air quote that.

712
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:33,030
No, I didn't. I'm just sayin' I know why you tryin' to protect him.

713
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,240
'Cause he "family".

714
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:39,240
Hey. Movin' the air quotes down to your hips doesn't un-air-quote them.

715
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,290
Just say he's my son.

716
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:43,330
He's your son. No, no.

717
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:47,580
Palms up is like you tryin' to say, oh, he's not really my son.

718
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:51,630
Oh. Well, your son's gettin' away.

719
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:52,920
Shit.

720
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,850
If your men are on some kind of op, you might wanna pull us in.

721
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:06,520
Otherwise, it doesn't look good for them.

722
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:10,070
Judy.

723
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:13,070
You ID the bodies? Roger. We got three unaccounted for.

724
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,200
Lowrey, Burnett and Aretas.

725
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,780
Motherfuckers. Fucking--!

726
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:19,950
Shit.

727
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,490
All right. Listen up!

728
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:25,960
We have three suspects, armed and dangerous, out there.

729
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,420
And I want them back.

730
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,250
Let's go!

731
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:32,710
Hold on. Judy.

732
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:34,590
Three suspects?

733
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:36,340
What do you think is happening here?

734
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:38,930
What do you think?

735
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:41,510
Play the audio.

736
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:45,480
US Marshal flight 724, we have an emergency.

737
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:49,310
Our prisoner has escaped custody with the aid of Miami PD Lowrey and Burnett.

738
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:51,520
There are officers down. Mayday, mayday.

739
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:55,530
Come on, you can't possibly believe Mike and Marcus would do this.

740
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:59,450
Nah, you said it. Lowrey was obsessed with getting his son out of prison.

741
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:01,120
Slow down, Judy.

742
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,540
This isn't Miami, Secada.

743
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:07,210
These are my fugitives and right now the whole world is my jurisdiction.

744
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:09,710
You've known them your whole life. How can you even suggest--?

745
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:12,340
Do I think that Mike and Marcus planned this?

746
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,420
Probably not.

747
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:17,130
But people do things they wouldn't normally do when family's involved.

748
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:19,590
In my experience innocent men don't run.

749
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:23,260
Can we stop and think before-Are you capable of doing your job?

750
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:24,770
'Cause I need to move on.

751
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,520
They survived.

752
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:33,570
What the fuck you mean, they survived?

753
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:37,150
No bodies on site. US Marshals are treating it as a manhunt.

754
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:41,320
These guys just refuse to die.

755
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,280
They're wanted men.

756
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,870
Law enforcement and media are our friends now.

757
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:49,580
A manhunt for three fugitives

758
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:51,580
is sending shock waves across South Florida.

759
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:54,290
Ballistic reports have matched the bullets recovered from the bodies...

760
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:57,970
Are you planning on dropping out of the mayor's race in light of the recent events?

761
00:52:57,970 --> 00:52:59,800
The manhunt is currently underway.

762
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:04,050
The FBI is assisting US Marshals in bringing these men in.

763
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:09,890
Lowrey, Burnett and Aretas should be considered armed and dangerous.

764
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:14,310
These are individuals who have killed fellow law enforcement professionals.

765
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:17,530
If you see something, say something.

766
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:19,950
Put a bounty on the streets.

767
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,620
Get it to every gang in the city and let them fight for it.

768
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:28,370
Five mil.

769
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:31,290
Let's go get these motherfuckers.

770
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,510
The universe is crazy, ain't it?

771
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:44,640
Look at us.

772
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:49,140
I bet none of us thought when we woke up today this is where we'd be.

773
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:51,730
You outta jail.

774
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:53,600
We goin' to jail.

775
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,270
This shit is special.

776
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:57,980
Mike?

777
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:01,740
Is there anything you would like to say to Armando?

778
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,320
Fuck you talkin' to me like that? No.

779
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:07,120
Mike, this is a moment. Express with your son.

780
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:17,540
I'm sorry.

781
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:20,760
That's what I'm talking about.

782
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,300
For what? For everything, man.

783
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:27,350
Seems like bad shit happens to anybody I love, so...

784
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:30,100
Startin' to think maybe I'm cursed.

785
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,390
I just feel like...

786
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:33,890
maybe I cursed you.

787
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:37,610
You ain't fuckin' cursed me.

788
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:40,030
Bad shit happens to everybody.

789
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,650
Ain't always about you.

790
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:44,910
Hey, Armando.

791
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:49,450
I don't know if I told you this, but I died a couple of weeks ago.

792
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,040
Sorry to hear about that.

793
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,920
Oh, no. The best thing that ever happened to me.

794
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,330
Shit's wild.

795
00:54:56,330 --> 00:54:57,840
But y'all?

796
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,500
Y'all the reason I came back.

797
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,670
Hey.

798
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:04,880
Everybody, bring it in.

799
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,720
Come on, bring it in. Come on.

800
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:09,760
What?

801
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:11,850
There you go, Armando.

802
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:14,100
There you go. There you--

803
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:16,650
Y'all are some terrible fuckin' fugitives.

804
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:21,940
So, what are you, fuckin' Marcus Winfrey?

805
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:23,530
What? Now, see?

806
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:26,200
You makin' us look soft, like we don't know how to be on the run.

807
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:41,090
Better get you out of this.

808
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,510
Hey!

809
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:46,840
That boy hard-headed. Chip off the old block.

810
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:08,820
Well, what we got here?

811
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,200
Hey, Cain, come take a look at this!

812
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:15,290
What are you boys doin'?

813
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:16,790
"Boys"?

814
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,250
Are y'all stealing our clothes? Looks like it.

815
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,920
Fuckin' racism.

816
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,960
Y'all think just because we Black we stealin' your shit?

817
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,300
Now, these are my own Black clothes

818
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:31,850
that I put on today from my own Black closet.

819
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:33,060
Marcus! What?

820
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:34,220
Look at your shirt.

821
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:43,070
How'd this get in my Black closet?

822
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:47,070
Why don't you boys sing us a little Reba song.

823
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:51,910
Reba? Reba? Oh, yeah.

824
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:54,080
Oh, please.

825
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,620
That's-'Cause he put... He put me on to Reb--

826
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:59,790
Which one? Which y'all--? Which one?

827
00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:01,210
Sing your favourite.

828
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,420
Oh, she got plenty of them. 'Cause she got hits.

829
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:09,300
Was it the up-tempo song? Or the slow jam? Yeah, yeah, remember the one?

830
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:12,050
It was the slow one, nigga. Oh, okay.

831
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:15,140
You hurt me in the morning Yes, 'cause she was hurt.

832
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:17,430
You hurt me at night Yes, yes.

833
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,940
But I've changed Changed

834
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:22,020
And I'm strong I'm a woman

835
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:23,310
I'm a strong Black wom--

836
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,730
I'm a strong woman

837
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:26,860
Yeah, 'cause she's not Black.

838
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,700
And then...

839
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,450
What you gonna do?

840
00:57:32,570 --> 00:57:34,160
What you gonna d--?

841
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,830
That ain't no Reba song.

842
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:39,250
It's from her mixtape.

843
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,340
Goddamn it!

844
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,760
We're sorry! We'll bring it back!

845
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:56,680
We're not stealing your shit because we Black!

846
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:12,320
Did you ever love her?

847
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,660
What?

848
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:18,330
My mother. You ever love her?

849
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:21,210
He's expressing.

850
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,540
I definitely loved her.

851
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,670
And then you sold her out.

852
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:29,000
I made some mistakes.

853
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:30,630
Like me.

854
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:34,340
You know that is not what I was trying-Now wait a damn minute, Armando.

855
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:36,050
He's trying to make up for it.

856
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:37,850
He don't owe you a damn thing.

857
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:41,350
All right, hold on. Hold on, Marcus. You're just... You're being aggressive.

858
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:44,390
I've been a dad a long time. He needs to hear this, Mike.

859
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:46,150
He needs some tough-ass love.

860
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:50,530
Armando. Maybe he does owe you something. Okay?

861
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:52,440
Your mom being deceived by him.

862
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:56,370
You being born in prison, in a web of lies

863
00:58:56,370 --> 00:59:00,830
that turned your ass into a stone-cold fuckin' killer.

864
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:04,160
Yeah. You're a killer.

865
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:10,630
But this man, through it all, has been nothing but solid.

866
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:15,340
That's some father-of-the-year shit right there.

867
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:16,680
Is it?

868
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:22,390
Your wack-ass parenting broke the truck.

869
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,350
My bad.

870
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,190
Yeah, nah, that's dead.

871
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:28,650
We're not far from Tabitha's.

872
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:30,860
No, Mike. You know that woman's crazy.

873
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:32,440
Yeah, but she likes me.

874
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,650
I don't think she likes you as much as you think.

875
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:37,360
The Pony's about two miles from here. What's The Pony?

876
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:52,300
I need my Instagram. I need my Friendster. I need more sex.

877
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:54,590
I need more men in this club.

878
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:56,970
You all look beautiful. Now get back to work.

879
00:59:57,890 --> 01:00:00,550
Mike Lowrey. Damn.

880
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:01,720
What up, Tabitha?

881
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:05,430
So y'all in trouble, huh?

882
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:07,640
Yeah, we need some help.

883
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:09,610
We need some clothes. No shit.

884
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:11,400
A ride and some phones.

885
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,190
Yeah. Guns too.

886
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:16,400
That's my son. That's Armando.

887
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,160
You got you a little Spanish son?

888
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,410
Yeah, it's a long story.

889
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:22,200
Can you hook us up?

890
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:25,830
I mean, I got all that but what you gonna do for me?

891
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:27,790
What you mean? We good for that.

892
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,170
You were.

893
01:00:29,790 --> 01:00:32,210
But you guys are men on the run now, so...

894
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:33,670
Well, what you need?

895
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:35,090
What I need?

896
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,590
I need you to eat this pussy.

897
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:43,760
I'm not doin' that, all right?

898
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:47,100
Whoa, hold on, Mike, hold on. Think about this.

899
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:49,940
Now, you say guns and phones, right?

900
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:53,190
Okay, well, look, you know Mike's a married man.

901
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:54,270
So?

902
01:00:54,270 --> 01:00:56,820
So he's gonna need some plausible deniability.

903
01:00:56,820 --> 01:01:00,820
So I'mma have you lay down and stick out your tongue.

904
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:02,660
And you gonna have to do the rest.

905
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:04,370
I can fuck with that.

906
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:07,120
Oh, yeah, go on, baby. No, Marcus.

907
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:10,500
All you gotta do is close your eyes, Mike. No!

908
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,290
I'mma need pictures. You know how to take pictures, right?

909
01:01:13,290 --> 01:01:16,760
Hey. We don't have a lot of time. I need you to stop fuckin' around.

910
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,300
Oh, I'm not fuckin' around.

911
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,760
All right, hey, let's go.

912
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,010
Wait, hold up.

913
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,600
Sit your motherfuckin' ass down.

914
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,850
Hey, Tabitha, what is you doin'? What is you doin'?!

915
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:29,180
Sit your married ass down! You get y'all asses down too!

916
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:30,850
Shit. Everybody sit down.

917
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:34,060
Hey, I got the bad boys right here. Let's get that money.

918
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:36,690
Hey, Tab. Shut the fuck up.

919
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:39,240
Hold up, I'm confused.

920
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:40,990
You didn't want him to licky-licky?

921
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:43,240
There's a $5 million bounty on your head.

922
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:45,330
I need that money. I was just stalling.

923
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:48,540
That's... That's cold. He almost did that shit.

924
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:49,870
He did not, Marcus.

925
01:01:49,870 --> 01:01:52,040
I told you she didn't like you.

926
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:53,420
Get the fuck up.

927
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:01,220
The bounty is dead or alive.

928
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:03,300
Don't be stupid.

929
01:02:06,850 --> 01:02:08,020
Hey, Armando.

930
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:10,230
If you live, I'll let you...

931
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:12,520
What?

932
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:15,310
I said if you live, motherfucker, holler at me.

933
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:18,610
He was kinda cute.

934
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:23,070
We got a tip.

935
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:25,910
Positive ID on our fugitives.

936
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:27,530
Let's do this.

937
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:36,130
Mike, I'm about to make my move.

938
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:39,210
No, the fuck you're not. You about to go wherever these men are taking us.

939
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:40,550
Oh, I'm not goin'.

940
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:44,050
Now I'll take the three in the front, you take the six in the back.

941
01:02:44,050 --> 01:02:46,430
Marcus, we do not have any weapons.

942
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:50,350
In five... four... three...

943
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:51,680
Fuck!

944
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,500
Ah, shit! This motherfucker.

945
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:16,120
Fuckboy, fuckboy Whatcha gonna do?

946
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,630
Ayo, Mike!

947
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:20,130
Ain't no fun when the rabbit got the gun, huh?

948
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:21,550
Wait, you know this guy?

949
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:23,760
Yeah, I hit him with a hammer a couple years ago.

950
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:27,930
You think I forgot about that fucking ho shit you pulled off at Manny's Prime Rib?

951
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:29,930
How the fuck did I let you two catch me?

952
01:03:30,430 --> 01:03:31,890
Mike, I want my five million.

953
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:33,430
Marcus!

954
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:36,310
You see I got the fam with me. The streets!

955
01:03:36,310 --> 01:03:39,520
We could do this nice and easy or we can go to war!

956
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:40,900
'Cause I'm fucking war-ready!

957
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:43,240
What are you doing?!

958
01:03:45,070 --> 01:03:46,070
No!

959
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,460
Go, go, go, go!

960
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:05,090
Back up! Back up! Back up!

961
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:11,390
No! No!

962
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:14,770
Windshield wiper fluid is flammable!

963
01:04:14,770 --> 01:04:18,480
How the hell am I supposed to know that?! I ain't no damn scientist!

964
01:04:23,690 --> 01:04:26,780
Everybody relax. The fire's on the outside.

965
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:30,740
Oh, shit!

966
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:32,450
Now it's on the inside!

967
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:36,790
Shit!

968
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:37,960
Okay.

969
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:41,170
Okay.

970
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:13,660
Everybody out! Everybody out!

971
01:05:40,890 --> 01:05:42,230
Shit.

972
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:56,740
Open the damn door!

973
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:02,120
We can feel you right there, boy. Open the door.

974
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:11,220
Hey!

975
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:13,050
Open up, Muscle Milk.

976
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:14,930
Come on, man. What the fuck is you doing?

977
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:17,810
Nothing. It's just not a great time for me right now, guys.

978
01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:19,310
It's not a great time for us either.

979
01:06:19,310 --> 01:06:21,190
Okay, let's reconvene in like an hour or so.

980
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:23,150
Babe, we're out of body wash.

981
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:25,560
What the hell?

982
01:06:26,770 --> 01:06:27,980
We found you guys.

983
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:31,530
We're in a relationship. Okay?

984
01:06:32,450 --> 01:06:33,660
Oh, okay. All right.

985
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:35,240
Sneaking around has been destroying me.

986
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:38,620
It started about a couple months ago. It will not affect our professional lives.

987
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:40,500
Except for that one time in that van.

988
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:43,330
I am not sorry. Nothing to be sorry about.

989
01:06:43,330 --> 01:06:45,920
Yeah, you know. I mean, people do that shit.

990
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:48,500
Are you guys okay? Yeah, we're good. I wanted to--

991
01:06:50,550 --> 01:06:52,510
What the fuck?! Okay. Whoa, whoa.

992
01:06:52,510 --> 01:06:54,640
Hey, Kelly. Kelly.

993
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:57,720
I asked you to wait outside for a second.

994
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:00,350
All right. Kelly, he's with us.

995
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:01,680
He can't be here.

996
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,640
This is my son, Armando.

997
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:06,770
I know who he is, and that's why he can't be here.

998
01:07:06,770 --> 01:07:10,190
I trust you with my life, Mike. But I as sure as shit don't trust him.

999
01:07:10,190 --> 01:07:11,490
I trust him.

1000
01:07:11,490 --> 01:07:13,570
Then take him to your house.

1001
01:07:14,950 --> 01:07:17,280
Hey, Mike. Can I have a second with her, please?

1002
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,620
Yeah, yeah. Please.

1003
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:20,580
Hey, sweetie. Relax. Relax.

1004
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:22,290
Come here for a sec. Come over here for a second.

1005
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:27,330
We could both end up in jail.

1006
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:34,550
Give him a chance. Yeah, give him a chance to kill us all?

1007
01:07:35,090 --> 01:07:37,590
This is some dysfunctional shit.

1008
01:07:40,430 --> 01:07:42,890
She's fine. She don't look fine.

1009
01:07:42,890 --> 01:07:44,940
I'm fine. Yes, you are.

1010
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:47,900
The fuck you say? All right, all right.

1011
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:50,900
It's the language barrier. It was English.

1012
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:52,570
It was definitely English.

1013
01:07:58,570 --> 01:07:59,620
Thanks for the drip.

1014
01:08:00,530 --> 01:08:02,790
Yeah. Okay, we're aggregating all the data.

1015
01:08:02,790 --> 01:08:06,040
There's over 100 hours of video, 200 units of audio.

1016
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:09,670
We're indexing all audio, video and geo-located IP network data

1017
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:12,300
to create a sight picture and develop a target package.

1018
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:15,510
Basically, you sifting through all this shit to find the guilty motherfucker.

1019
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:16,760
Bingo.

1020
01:08:17,470 --> 01:08:18,550
Hey, Dorn.

1021
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:22,810
Can you safely get me into my Ring app? I wanna see my family.

1022
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:25,730
Yeah, we got our own VPN and router. What's your username?

1023
01:08:25,730 --> 01:08:27,440
Marcus37.

1024
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:28,940
And password?

1025
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:30,940
Snickers89.

1026
01:08:38,110 --> 01:08:40,030
Almost home, baby.

1027
01:08:40,030 --> 01:08:42,370
Hey, let's get to work. We got a lot to get through here.

1028
01:08:42,370 --> 01:08:44,290
So, what exactly are we looking for?

1029
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:47,080
We're looking for the guy who ordered the hit on Cap.

1030
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:48,960
Armando can ID him.

1031
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:58,010
This fucking bastard has been my white whale.

1032
01:08:58,010 --> 01:09:02,300
For the last nine years, I've been trying to harpoon the son of a bitch.

1033
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:04,520
But now it's up to you.

1034
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:26,870
Ey-Ey-Ey. Do I walk into your house and show you how to make cocaine?

1035
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:28,210
Blow it up.

1036
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:37,170
It's him.

1037
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:44,760
You sure?

1038
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:46,930
That's the guy that ordered the hit.

1039
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:48,390
Bam. Got a name.

1040
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:52,310
James McGrath. Army Ranger School, counterintelligence.

1041
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:55,110
Deployed in Mexico until 2005.

1042
01:09:55,110 --> 01:09:57,940
Worked with the DEA, Defence Attache's office.

1043
01:09:57,940 --> 01:09:59,530
Oh, shit.

1044
01:09:59,530 --> 01:10:03,120
He was taken hostage by your friends, the cartel.

1045
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:06,160
He gave up his entire squad "under duress".

1046
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,540
It's called torture, man.

1047
01:10:08,450 --> 01:10:10,160
He was the only survivor.

1048
01:10:15,130 --> 01:10:16,800
Cap had him the whole time.

1049
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,380
He just didn't know it.

1050
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:23,010
Hello.

1051
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:24,800
Hey. It's me.

1052
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:27,810
Damn it, Michael. Where are you?

1053
01:10:27,810 --> 01:10:31,310
Rita, we're coming in. We got proof that Captain Howard is innocent.

1054
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:33,150
What proof?

1055
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:36,320
We got the guy that had Captain Howard killed.

1056
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:37,610
Armando ID'd him.

1057
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:40,820
Same dude that attacked us on the chopper. James McGrath.

1058
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:43,490
Rita, we got ten years' worth of files.

1059
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:46,950
Cap was investigating these dudes. We got 'em all. It's a whole network.

1060
01:10:46,950 --> 01:10:49,410
We'll surrender to you tomorrow.

1061
01:10:49,410 --> 01:10:51,120
Hey, look, we gotta go.

1062
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,210
Michael, what--?

1063
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,130
You okay?

1064
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:00,050
They're coming in.

1065
01:11:00,050 --> 01:11:01,260
What?

1066
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:05,340
Michael says they have proof that exonerates Howard...

1067
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:06,800
explains everything.

1068
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:10,930
Do you still love him?

1069
01:11:11,730 --> 01:11:12,730
What?

1070
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:14,350
No.

1071
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:16,440
But I believe him.

1072
01:11:17,650 --> 01:11:19,230
Just be careful, babe.

1073
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:22,570
Still going to dinner?

1074
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:23,740
Yeah.

1075
01:11:27,870 --> 01:11:29,160
They have the files.

1076
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:32,120
We need to make this look like cartel business. Spanish only.

1077
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:37,670
Ammo's ready to go. Let's go.

1078
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:51,140
We only need one hostage.

1079
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:53,180
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1080
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:56,690
You guys! We got a problem.

1081
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:01,070
Miami Central, Miami Central. 29 in progress.

1082
01:12:01,190 --> 01:12:03,320
Oh shit, that's my house.

1083
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:05,570
Please advise, MOS residence.

1084
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:06,950
Respond forthwith.

1085
01:12:06,950 --> 01:12:11,540
Fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, no.

1086
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:12,790
Come on, Christine.

1087
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:22,750
Shit. Get a unit over to my house.

1088
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:26,220
Come on, Reggie! Pick up! Pick up.

1089
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:28,430
Miami Central, we have another 29 in progress.

1090
01:12:28,430 --> 01:12:31,430
Please send units to Detective Lowrey's home address.

1091
01:12:32,310 --> 01:12:33,930
Enemy's down!

1092
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:37,020
Reggie! You got incoming.

1093
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:39,560
Get the family to somewhere safe. What?

1094
01:12:39,690 --> 01:12:41,150
Now! Yes, sir.

1095
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:46,860
What's happening? What's going on?

1096
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:49,820
There's people comin' in the house. I gotta keep y'all safe.

1097
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:55,370
Please be careful!

1098
01:12:55,370 --> 01:12:57,330
Okay, Reggie, what's happening? Okay. Trust me. I love you.

1099
01:12:57,870 --> 01:12:59,420
Fuck! Fuck!

1100
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:13,640
Behind you, Reg!

1101
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:16,390
Oh, damn!

1102
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:28,030
Who the fuck is this guy?! That's my boy! That's my boy!

1103
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:36,580
Damn!

1104
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:38,870
Come on, come on, come on.

1105
01:13:59,770 --> 01:14:01,230
No, no, no!

1106
01:14:03,150 --> 01:14:04,480
Holy shit!

1107
01:14:09,070 --> 01:14:10,240
Come on, come on!

1108
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,410
Holy shit!

1109
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:26,460
Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang, motherfuckers.

1110
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:28,210
Me snacks is your snacks, Reggie.

1111
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:29,670
All right, come on.

1112
01:14:33,390 --> 01:14:35,100
Mike, did you see that shit?

1113
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:36,760
Pick up the phone.

1114
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:40,180
Whoa, Mike! Mike! Mike!

1115
01:14:46,270 --> 01:14:47,270
One second.

1116
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:53,200
Callie.

1117
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:55,660
I saw it on TV. My mom is after Uncle Mike.

1118
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:58,660
There is no way that he did everything that they're saying.

1119
01:14:58,660 --> 01:14:59,870
Sweetheart.

1120
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:04,120
Everything is going to be okay.

1121
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:06,710
Okay? Okay?

1122
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:20,310
Hello? It's me. Get out of the house.

1123
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:24,020
I've got Callie with me. Take her and go! Get out now!

1124
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:27,940
Callie, get behind me.

1125
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:30,730
Mike.

1126
01:15:36,410 --> 01:15:37,700
Christine!

1127
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:48,670
Mr Lowrey.

1128
01:15:50,210 --> 01:15:51,590
Who am I speaking to?

1129
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:54,420
I think you know who you're speaking to.

1130
01:15:55,090 --> 01:15:56,430
I need your boy...

1131
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:01,060
and whatever evidence your beloved captain had squirrelled away.

1132
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:04,690
And for that, you can have your wife.

1133
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:07,100
I'll call you back with instructions.

1134
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:10,110
Aw, shit.

1135
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:13,440
Goddamn it.

1136
01:16:14,490 --> 01:16:15,490
I'll go.

1137
01:16:21,290 --> 01:16:22,830
Let my life be worth something.

1138
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:26,460
Never.

1139
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:30,340
Never.

1140
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:39,430
Mike.

1141
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:42,180
He knew.

1142
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:43,640
What do you mean?

1143
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:46,560
He knew we were comin' in.

1144
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,940
He knew we had Captain Howard's files.

1145
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,570
He knew we had ID'd him.

1146
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:53,070
How?

1147
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:55,940
Only person you spoke to was Rita.

1148
01:16:57,110 --> 01:16:58,410
It's not Rita.

1149
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:03,580
Damn, she got bad taste in men.

1150
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:07,710
Justice has been investigating the corruption in the Miami Police Department...

1151
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:10,420
...with reports suggesting the late Captain Conrad Howard...

1152
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:11,630
Hello?

1153
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:14,050
...was directing these elements in coordination with the cartels.

1154
01:17:14,050 --> 01:17:16,920
Allegations against Howard, which allude to include Lowrey and Burnett,

1155
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:22,180
and the operation range from helping cartels move the product into the state of Florida

1156
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:25,020
as well as giving up key witnesses, destruction of evidence,

1157
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:26,850
and even the murder of fellow officers.

1158
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:29,310
What's going on? I don't know.

1159
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:33,900
There's been a breakthrough in the case. I need to get down to the station.

1160
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:37,110
I'm gonna head down there.

1161
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:41,740
I'm coming with you.

1162
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:56,760
Who are you texting?

1163
01:17:57,670 --> 01:18:01,800
Just... Just gotta get in touch with the office.

1164
01:18:02,890 --> 01:18:04,180
JTF.

1165
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:06,140
Gotta let everybody know.

1166
01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:15,650
Hey. Honey. Come on.

1167
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:18,070
Honey, what are you doing? Stop that.

1168
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:19,860
What are you doing? Stop it.

1169
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:21,660
Let go of me. What are you doing?

1170
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:23,280
Give it back to me. Give it back!

1171
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:56,650
Fuck!

1172
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:58,900
Hey, hey, come on.

1173
01:19:01,490 --> 01:19:02,570
You okay?

1174
01:19:02,570 --> 01:19:03,990
Look at the phone.

1175
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,630
You know you done fucked up, right?

1176
01:19:22,130 --> 01:19:23,380
You all right?

1177
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:28,890
I'm sorry.

1178
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:32,390
Ain't got nothing to be sorry for.

1179
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:57,210
We'll find her, boss.

1180
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:05,430
I don't trust anybody that's not standing right here, right now.

1181
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:08,800
Every extra person that we involve

1182
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:11,890
increases the likelihood that they know we're coming,

1183
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:16,560
which increases the likelihood that Christine and Callie

1184
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,400
don't make it out of there.

1185
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:23,740
That means no SWAT, no marshals, no backup.

1186
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:26,700
It's just us.

1187
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:34,000
I never meant for it to go this way.

1188
01:20:34,790 --> 01:20:36,460
How did you mean it to go?

1189
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:40,960
After 9/11, nobody cared about drugs coming into this country.

1190
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:44,170
So to secure the borders we started to work with the cartels.

1191
01:20:44,170 --> 01:20:48,010
And they kept us informed about any terrorist activity coming our way.

1192
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:51,510
And it worked. We haven't had an attack since.

1193
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:53,810
We were protecting this country.

1194
01:20:53,810 --> 01:20:58,350
You were killing cops and getting rich putting drugs into this country.

1195
01:20:58,350 --> 01:21:00,730
Rita. That's why you killed Howard.

1196
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:03,110
He was onto you. You wanted to cover your tracks.

1197
01:21:03,110 --> 01:21:05,400
No. That was McGrath.

1198
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:07,610
He's out of control.

1199
01:21:07,610 --> 01:21:10,120
Rita. Just take a second.

1200
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:13,200
I never meant for any of this to go this way.

1201
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:26,550
I guess I just need to know if it was ever real.

1202
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:29,010
It was always real.

1203
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:32,470
I panicked. I lost control.

1204
01:21:33,140 --> 01:21:34,770
Did you love me?

1205
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:36,060
Yes.

1206
01:21:36,730 --> 01:21:38,140
I swear.

1207
01:21:38,850 --> 01:21:40,440
Well, that means...

1208
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:41,610
We good. We got it.

1209
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:43,650
99% voice match.

1210
01:21:45,070 --> 01:21:49,360
...absolutely nothing to me, you piece of shit.

1211
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:57,750
Hey. It's me.

1212
01:21:58,370 --> 01:22:00,330
What the hell's going on?

1213
01:22:00,330 --> 01:22:02,080
You screwed up is what's going on.

1214
01:22:02,210 --> 01:22:06,050
We've been compromised. I'll explain when I get there.

1215
01:22:06,050 --> 01:22:09,420
We're moving the hostages. Cuba. Long-term hold...

1216
01:22:10,090 --> 01:22:14,300
to keep Lowrey, Burnett and Aretas quiet while we sort this out.

1217
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:17,600
I'm bringing a seaplane. I'll be there at first light.

1218
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:24,440
All right, pack this place up.

1219
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:27,110
All equipment and personnel prepare to move.

1220
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:29,740
We're moving the hostages out of the country.

1221
01:22:44,210 --> 01:22:45,710
What happened to your hand?

1222
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:56,810
They call that a Colombian manicure.

1223
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:04,520
What's so great about it

1224
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:07,070
is it's the maximum amount of pain,

1225
01:23:07,070 --> 01:23:08,190
but you don't die.

1226
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:16,660
So now you've decided to be the one holding the pliers.

1227
01:23:18,370 --> 01:23:19,950
Everybody breaks.

1228
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,290
Everyone.

1229
01:23:22,870 --> 01:23:24,170
Your husband...

1230
01:23:24,790 --> 01:23:27,090
is gonna kneel down in front of me...

1231
01:23:27,590 --> 01:23:29,510
and beg for your lives.

1232
01:23:30,670 --> 01:23:33,180
And then you're gonna watch me kill him.

1233
01:23:36,090 --> 01:23:38,310
You don't know my husband.

1234
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:41,310
Well, not officially, but...

1235
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:43,980
I look forward to seeing him again.

1236
01:23:56,660 --> 01:23:59,580
Bad boys Bad boys

1237
01:24:05,330 --> 01:24:06,750
Come on, Mike.

1238
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,130
Bad boys Bad boys

1239
01:24:16,930 --> 01:24:18,510
Whatchu you gonna do

1240
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:20,180
Yeah.

1241
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:23,270
What you gonna do When they come for you

1242
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:29,270
That's enough, dawg. That's enough.

1243
01:24:29,270 --> 01:24:31,980
Okay, well, we'll circle back on that one.

1244
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:45,540
All right. The plane is ready. We roll in 20.

1245
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:48,330
It's an abandoned amusement park. There should be no civilians.

1246
01:24:48,330 --> 01:24:51,800
Plane is gonna land from the south. On the one side.

1247
01:24:52,550 --> 01:24:55,050
Marcus and I will be on the plane.

1248
01:24:55,050 --> 01:24:58,760
Armando's gonna make his way in the water. The two side.

1249
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:03,220
Kelly, Rita. This road is one way in, one way out.

1250
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:05,060
You're holding that road.

1251
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:08,810
Dorn, you're gonna control the air.

1252
01:25:08,810 --> 01:25:12,570
Drones in the air, jamming is active, comms are secure.

1253
01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:15,740
As far as they know, Lockwood is on his way with the plane

1254
01:25:15,740 --> 01:25:18,240
to move the hostages to Cuba.

1255
01:25:19,110 --> 01:25:22,490
The second they get close to the plane with the hostages, it's quick kills.

1256
01:25:22,490 --> 01:25:24,290
Neutralise all threats.

1257
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:26,830
These motherfuckers killed a lot of good cops.

1258
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:29,000
They have my wife, they have Callie.

1259
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,960
They attacked our families.

1260
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:33,090
We not losing today.

1261
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:37,260
Hey.

1262
01:25:38,470 --> 01:25:41,010
We get on the ground, you even flinch,

1263
01:25:41,010 --> 01:25:43,180
you'll be dead in .24 seconds.

1264
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:44,600
I concur.

1265
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:48,560
I got one lookout on the platform outside.

1266
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:51,360
I got one sniper on the roof of building two.

1267
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:53,020
Tee those up.

1268
01:25:55,820 --> 01:25:57,280
Everybody keep moving.

1269
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:59,360
What are those? Gators.

1270
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:02,070
I thought it was an abandoned gator park.

1271
01:26:02,070 --> 01:26:03,450
Abandoned by humans.

1272
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:05,700
It's actually an old amusement park.

1273
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:09,120
It sat on 10 acres, abandoned in 2017 after Hurricane Irma.

1274
01:26:09,670 --> 01:26:14,130
Their main attraction was an albino alligator named Duke...

1275
01:26:14,130 --> 01:26:17,630
...who was 16 feet long, 900 pounds.

1276
01:26:17,630 --> 01:26:20,220
"And legend has it he's still there."

1277
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:21,890
Fuck that.

1278
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:38,240
Armando's at his QTH.

1279
01:27:03,590 --> 01:27:05,430
Hostages are coming out now.

1280
01:27:05,430 --> 01:27:06,890
McGrath plus three.

1281
01:27:07,430 --> 01:27:08,850
Everybody stay calm.

1282
01:27:19,610 --> 01:27:20,820
Mike.

1283
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,030
Mike, do you have the shot?

1284
01:27:25,030 --> 01:27:28,450
Negative. I do not have a shot. I do not have a shot.

1285
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:35,420
Mike, he's right there. I don't have it. I don't have it.

1286
01:27:42,380 --> 01:27:44,680
They stopped. Why'd they stop?

1287
01:27:58,320 --> 01:27:59,400
Shit.

1288
01:28:02,530 --> 01:28:03,900
Let's go.

1289
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:15,710
Armando, they're closing in on you.

1290
01:28:15,710 --> 01:28:17,540
Do they see him? I don't know.

1291
01:28:17,540 --> 01:28:20,090
Mike, now. Your chance is now.

1292
01:28:20,090 --> 01:28:22,380
They can see him. They know we're here.

1293
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:27,090
I don't have it. Negative. Negative. Negative.

1294
01:28:27,090 --> 01:28:29,140
You gotta take the fuckin' shot.

1295
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:50,330
Armando's burnt.

1296
01:28:51,540 --> 01:28:54,120
Shit. Full green. Engage.

1297
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:56,540
Kelly, get us there. Go, go, go!

1298
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:21,480
Contact, west dock side.

1299
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:31,870
Dorn! Take out that sniper!

1300
01:29:32,370 --> 01:29:33,620
Sending the drone.

1301
01:29:42,790 --> 01:29:43,880
Got him.

1302
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:08,400
Not now, Mike!

1303
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:10,110
Not now!

1304
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:32,720
It's okay.

1305
01:30:33,510 --> 01:30:34,930
Not your fault.

1306
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:45,190
Cut that bitch-ass shit out, Mike.

1307
01:30:45,190 --> 01:30:46,780
I need Nasty Mike.

1308
01:30:46,780 --> 01:30:48,030
Nasty Mike!

1309
01:30:48,030 --> 01:30:50,950
Bad shit happens, but that doesn't mean you're bad.

1310
01:30:50,950 --> 01:30:54,120
Do that donkey shit, a'ight? That's what I'm talking about.

1311
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:56,540
That shit right there. That's that shit right there.

1312
01:30:57,120 --> 01:31:01,000
Bad boy. Bad boy. Bad Boy Mike. All right?

1313
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,540
You're the big bad wolf in the neighbourhood

1314
01:31:03,540 --> 01:31:06,000
Not bad meaning bad but bad meaning good

1315
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:38,290
Dorn, take out the vehicles on the four side. Copy.

1316
01:31:46,210 --> 01:31:47,590
Go, go! Move it!

1317
01:31:48,090 --> 01:31:51,090
Sir! We're taking heavies. We lost the trucks and three guys outside.

1318
01:31:51,220 --> 01:31:52,880
Goddamn it!

1319
01:31:53,470 --> 01:31:55,590
Set firing positions, both sides. Let 'em in.

1320
01:31:55,590 --> 01:31:56,680
Go.

1321
01:31:57,550 --> 01:32:01,430
Marshal Howard, heat signature at the site of the AMMO van is showing explosions.

1322
01:32:01,430 --> 01:32:02,850
ETA 15 minutes.

1323
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:08,770
Dorn, we need cover and we need eyes inside. Go, now.

1324
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:11,360
Here comes the smoke.

1325
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:14,990
I got your six.

1326
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:34,170
Shoot those motherfuckers!

1327
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:37,340
Get those drones down now! Go!

1328
01:32:37,340 --> 01:32:38,550
Move, move, move!

1329
01:32:38,550 --> 01:32:39,850
Eyes up!

1330
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:46,850
Oh, shit!

1331
01:32:46,850 --> 01:32:50,070
It's like redneck Jurassic Park in here.

1332
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:06,960
Let's get out of here, now.

1333
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:08,130
Kelly, go.

1334
01:33:08,130 --> 01:33:11,710
Dorn, back up Kelly inside. I'm going after Lockwood.

1335
01:33:12,340 --> 01:33:13,550
Babe, I'm comin'.

1336
01:33:20,350 --> 01:33:21,850
Armando, go for Callie!

1337
01:33:24,390 --> 01:33:25,480
Let go!

1338
01:33:26,230 --> 01:33:27,230
Mike!

1339
01:33:28,020 --> 01:33:29,020
Marcus!

1340
01:33:47,540 --> 01:33:48,670
Go!

1341
01:33:53,750 --> 01:33:54,960
I'm out!

1342
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:31,500
Nice to meet you, Mr Lowrey.

1343
01:34:33,210 --> 01:34:34,210
Grenade!

1344
01:34:40,090 --> 01:34:41,300
Oh sh--!

1345
01:34:54,860 --> 01:34:56,280
Holy shit!

1346
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:57,440
Hang on!

1347
01:35:29,470 --> 01:35:30,640
Stop!

1348
01:35:31,390 --> 01:35:32,560
Christine!

1349
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:36,060
Christine!

1350
01:35:36,570 --> 01:35:38,030
Shit.

1351
01:35:40,570 --> 01:35:42,110
Oh sh--!

1352
01:35:42,110 --> 01:35:44,160
Mike, I got this! No. No, no!

1353
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:46,200
Here I come, baby! Here I come!

1354
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:47,580
No! No! No!

1355
01:36:02,220 --> 01:36:03,510
Marcus!

1356
01:36:03,510 --> 01:36:05,010
What? Behind you.

1357
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:08,430
Oh, shit.

1358
01:36:17,810 --> 01:36:19,530
I got this, Mike.

1359
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:22,280
It's just Dukey, baby.

1360
01:36:25,070 --> 01:36:27,530
Marcus, my gun. I dropped my gun in the water. It's by your foot.

1361
01:36:27,530 --> 01:36:28,870
I don't need no gun, Mike.

1362
01:36:31,830 --> 01:36:33,660
Begone, gator.

1363
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:37,000
This is not your place, Duke.

1364
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:39,460
I rebuke you!

1365
01:36:43,130 --> 01:36:44,420
See, Mike?

1366
01:36:44,970 --> 01:36:47,470
That's how you command the universe.

1367
01:36:59,860 --> 01:37:02,030
Where's the gun? Where's the gun? Oh, shit!

1368
01:37:07,070 --> 01:37:07,910
Go, go.

1369
01:37:09,910 --> 01:37:13,290
That motherfucker racist, Mike. That motherfucker racist!

1370
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,500
Mike sent me.

1371
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:22,710
I need you to trust me.

1372
01:37:47,950 --> 01:37:48,990
Run.

1373
01:37:48,990 --> 01:37:50,200
Run!

1374
01:38:34,450 --> 01:38:36,540
Come on. Come on. Get up.

1375
01:38:51,180 --> 01:38:52,390
Stop!

1376
01:38:56,600 --> 01:38:58,140
Go! I'll slow you down.

1377
01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:03,480
Eyes on location.

1378
01:39:25,340 --> 01:39:26,670
Oh, shit.

1379
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:30,260
You alive?

1380
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:38,770
Shit.

1381
01:39:39,270 --> 01:39:40,480
Okay. Hey.

1382
01:39:43,770 --> 01:39:46,650
Rita, stop this. You don't want to shoot me.

1383
01:39:46,650 --> 01:39:47,730
You're right.

1384
01:40:09,170 --> 01:40:12,010
Come here. Okay. Okay. It's okay.

1385
01:40:12,930 --> 01:40:14,430
I fuckin' hate politicians.

1386
01:40:22,060 --> 01:40:23,730
Let's move! Go, go!

1387
01:40:27,190 --> 01:40:29,230
Fan out. Take the team upstairs.

1388
01:40:32,110 --> 01:40:33,530
No targets.

1389
01:40:38,740 --> 01:40:40,240
Go topside!

1390
01:40:52,550 --> 01:40:54,550
Okay. Okay, here.

1391
01:40:54,550 --> 01:40:56,130
Put me down. It's okay. Okay.

1392
01:40:56,260 --> 01:40:58,430
You okay? Yeah. Yeah.

1393
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:00,810
Hey.

1394
01:41:04,060 --> 01:41:05,310
Thank you.

1395
01:41:26,750 --> 01:41:28,670
I've been here before.

1396
01:41:31,250 --> 01:41:32,840
Oh, shit.

1397
01:41:56,240 --> 01:41:57,650
How did you let him catch you?

1398
01:41:57,650 --> 01:41:59,780
He's sneaky as hell, Mike.

1399
01:41:59,780 --> 01:42:01,740
Your wife and I were having a debate.

1400
01:42:01,740 --> 01:42:04,750
She seems to have an inflated impression of you.

1401
01:42:04,750 --> 01:42:06,660
Mike. Hey, bae.

1402
01:42:07,460 --> 01:42:09,710
Nevertheless, this is the end of the road.

1403
01:42:10,380 --> 01:42:12,000
One of them is about to die.

1404
01:42:12,750 --> 01:42:14,170
You choose.

1405
01:42:18,340 --> 01:42:20,300
What you don't know, Mr McGrath...

1406
01:42:21,180 --> 01:42:23,140
is one of 'em can't die.

1407
01:42:25,180 --> 01:42:26,810
Who you talking 'bout?

1408
01:42:26,810 --> 01:42:29,730
A wise man told me I was gonna have to make a hard choice.

1409
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:34,230
You need to check with that motherfucker before you out here choosing shit.

1410
01:42:34,230 --> 01:42:36,440
You have five seconds, Mr Lowrey.

1411
01:42:36,440 --> 01:42:38,110
We gonna need some more time, sir.

1412
01:42:38,110 --> 01:42:40,530
Four... three...

1413
01:42:40,530 --> 01:42:42,820
Mike. Don't you do no dumb shit.

1414
01:42:42,950 --> 01:42:43,990
...two...

1415
01:43:00,630 --> 01:43:03,140
Mike. Mike. Hey. Hey. I'm here.

1416
01:43:05,100 --> 01:43:06,850
Motherfucker done shot me.

1417
01:43:06,850 --> 01:43:08,270
Aw, damn.

1418
01:43:08,270 --> 01:43:11,770
Here. Let me check it. Let me see. No, Mike. Your donkey ass shot me again.

1419
01:43:11,770 --> 01:43:15,440
Let me look at it. Don't touch me with your donkey hooves, Mike.

1420
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:16,730
Damn, man.

1421
01:43:16,730 --> 01:43:18,740
Listen. I had to fucking take the shot.

1422
01:43:18,740 --> 01:43:19,860
No, Mike. No.

1423
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:21,910
Marcus. Let me take a look.

1424
01:43:21,910 --> 01:43:23,450
You see that shit, Christine?

1425
01:43:23,450 --> 01:43:26,910
I shot you in your vest. Stop bitchin'. It don't matter. Okay?

1426
01:43:26,910 --> 01:43:29,580
You see what you done devoted your life to, Christine?

1427
01:43:29,580 --> 01:43:31,580
I've got eyes on Aretas. Moving in.

1428
01:43:31,580 --> 01:43:33,210
Shit. That's Judy.

1429
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:35,880
Armando, do you copy?

1430
01:43:35,880 --> 01:43:37,090
Armando, do you copy?

1431
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:41,090
Oh, shit.

1432
01:43:41,090 --> 01:43:43,180
Mom. Mom, don't.

1433
01:43:43,180 --> 01:43:45,010
Get away from her.

1434
01:43:45,010 --> 01:43:46,600
Mom. Now!

1435
01:43:47,430 --> 01:43:49,020
Mom, listen to me, you don't understand.

1436
01:43:49,020 --> 01:43:50,980
Callie, I need you to listen to me.

1437
01:43:50,980 --> 01:43:54,350
I want you to step slowly to your right and walk towards me.

1438
01:43:54,350 --> 01:43:56,060
Mom. Mom, I'm fine, okay?

1439
01:43:56,520 --> 01:44:00,150
Callie, I need you to move out of the way.

1440
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:01,860
Mom.

1441
01:44:01,860 --> 01:44:05,410
Mom, don't shoot, don't shoot! Mom, he saved me. Stop!

1442
01:44:05,410 --> 01:44:06,660
Judy! Judy!

1443
01:44:06,660 --> 01:44:09,870
Back off, Mike! Put the gun down.

1444
01:44:11,540 --> 01:44:13,210
He saved my life.

1445
01:44:18,050 --> 01:44:19,670
Please, Mom.

1446
01:44:38,440 --> 01:44:40,440
Mom. Mom.

1447
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:43,150
Are you hit? Are you hit?

1448
01:44:43,150 --> 01:44:44,360
I'm good.

1449
01:44:45,240 --> 01:44:46,570
You good?

1450
01:44:51,750 --> 01:44:53,870
You did good. You did good.

1451
01:44:53,870 --> 01:44:55,670
Howard. Where are you?

1452
01:44:59,590 --> 01:45:01,130
Howard. Do you copy?

1453
01:45:04,090 --> 01:45:06,050
Howard, what's your location?

1454
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:11,680
Go.

1455
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:15,020
Before I change my mind.

1456
01:45:16,810 --> 01:45:18,610
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

1457
01:45:25,700 --> 01:45:28,280
Hey. You good? You good?

1458
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:29,620
Hey.

1459
01:45:29,620 --> 01:45:30,740
Take this.

1460
01:45:31,290 --> 01:45:33,120
Head south. Don't look back.

1461
01:45:33,120 --> 01:45:34,200
Hey.

1462
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:35,660
I got it.

1463
01:45:35,660 --> 01:45:36,870
Be good.

1464
01:45:37,580 --> 01:45:39,210
It's not up to you, detective.

1465
01:46:23,420 --> 01:46:25,300
Come on, come on. We got injured cops here.

1466
01:46:25,300 --> 01:46:27,510
I need you to bring the writ to me now.

1467
01:46:28,380 --> 01:46:29,510
I know, I know, I know.

1468
01:46:29,510 --> 01:46:31,600
How is he? You know, he'll pull through.

1469
01:46:38,690 --> 01:46:40,310
Don't kiss him, Christine.

1470
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:44,730
Mike, in our next life, you coming back as a pair of my shoes.

1471
01:46:44,730 --> 01:46:46,530
And I ain't gonna wear no socks.

1472
01:46:46,530 --> 01:46:48,610
And I'mma step in all kind of shit.

1473
01:46:49,110 --> 01:46:53,620
Miami DA and mayoral candidate Adam Lockwood and former Army Ranger James McGrath

1474
01:46:53,620 --> 01:46:55,450
were killed this morning in a firefight.

1475
01:46:55,450 --> 01:46:57,660
It is believed that Lockwood and McGrath were the key links

1476
01:46:57,660 --> 01:46:59,620
between Miami law enforcement and cartels.

1477
01:46:59,620 --> 01:47:02,040
The late Captain Howard has been fully exonerated.

1478
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:06,670
Co-conspirators are currently being rounded up by the FBI and the Miami PD.

1479
01:47:06,670 --> 01:47:10,340
The search for convicted killer Armando Aretas continues.

1480
01:47:10,340 --> 01:47:12,140
The fugitive remains at large.

1481
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:23,150
Hey, hey, hey. My people.

1482
01:47:23,150 --> 01:47:26,070
Where's Theresa? She's with Little Marcus by the swings.

1483
01:47:26,070 --> 01:47:27,820
Hey. I'm about you hook you all up.

1484
01:47:27,820 --> 01:47:29,150
I'm about you hook you up. Please. We're starving.

1485
01:47:29,150 --> 01:47:30,530
Watch this.

1486
01:47:31,700 --> 01:47:32,820
Partner.

1487
01:47:34,280 --> 01:47:35,700
What's all this?

1488
01:47:37,410 --> 01:47:38,540
Why you got on an apron?

1489
01:47:38,540 --> 01:47:40,540
Work on my grill skills.

1490
01:47:40,540 --> 01:47:42,880
No, Mike, you gotta earn the grill.

1491
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:47,840
This takes seasonings and temperatures. You can't just be cooking on my grill.

1492
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:50,920
Your grill? Joker, this is a public park.

1493
01:47:50,920 --> 01:47:53,010
You don't own every grill you see.

1494
01:47:53,010 --> 01:47:57,600
You know what, Mike? Why don't you go make some potato salad and set the table.

1495
01:47:57,600 --> 01:47:59,270
Oh, you talking dirty.

1496
01:47:59,270 --> 01:48:01,640
Now, look. I don't... I don't know what you got going on

1497
01:48:01,640 --> 01:48:05,360
with your barbecue dictatorship in your mind, but I ain't the one.

1498
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:07,650
I'm cooking on this grill whether you like it or not.

1499
01:48:07,650 --> 01:48:09,570
Hey, Mike-Excuse me, sirs.

1500
01:48:11,240 --> 01:48:13,030
What are you... What you doin', Reggie?

1501
01:48:13,160 --> 01:48:14,910
Request permission to cook my chicken.

1502
01:48:19,830 --> 01:48:21,580
Permission denied, Reggie. Go ahead somewhere, man.

1503
01:48:21,580 --> 01:48:23,710
Take your smock off and go play with the kids.

1504
01:48:23,710 --> 01:48:27,250
Listen, this is the man area of the barbecue.

1505
01:48:27,250 --> 01:48:32,550
Look, you know what? All due respect, we appreciate that you did save people that we love.

1506
01:48:32,550 --> 01:48:34,090
We appreciate that, right? Yeah, we appreciate that.

1507
01:48:34,090 --> 01:48:36,550
We appreciate that from here, Reggie. Yeah.

1508
01:48:36,550 --> 01:48:39,390
Now, back the fuck up. Yeah.

1509
01:48:39,390 --> 01:48:41,480
All right, look. I'm willing to compromise with you.

1510
01:48:41,480 --> 01:48:44,690
You can work that half of the grill. It's small. And I'll work this half.

1511
01:48:44,690 --> 01:48:46,560
Is he still standing there?

1512
01:48:48,900 --> 01:48:50,070
Yes, he is.

1513
01:48:50,070 --> 01:48:51,610
Huh, that's weird.

1514
01:48:51,610 --> 01:48:52,990
Yeah.

1515
01:48:52,990 --> 01:48:55,030
He think he hard now.

1516
01:48:56,570 --> 01:49:01,040
You need to let that motherfucker know he ain't cooking no chicken out here today.

1517
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:05,120
Mike. He killed 15 people at the house.

1518
01:49:05,710 --> 01:49:07,580
So, you not gonna handle this shit.

1519
01:49:07,580 --> 01:49:10,920
Yeah, I'm gonna let that motherfucker cook the chicken.

1520
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:18,350
Yeah, there's something weird in his eyes. So I'mma make the potato salad.

1521
01:49:18,350 --> 01:49:19,970
I'mma set the table. Yeah.

1522
01:49:19,970 --> 01:49:21,560
Permission granted, Reggie. There you go.

1523
01:55:28,340 --> 01:55:30,760
Come on. Bring your ass on.

1524
01:55:30,760 --> 01:55:32,800
It's too hot out here for this shit.

1525
01:55:32,930 --> 01:55:36,600
Wish I had a horse. At least I could ride that motherfucker.

1526
01:55:36,600 --> 01:55:40,770
All this free air out here, and I still smell your stinkin' ass.

1527
01:55:43,810 --> 01:55:45,190
I curse you, donkey.

1528
01:55:45,190 --> 01:55:47,990
I curse you for all lifetimes.

1529
01:55:49,530 --> 01:55:50,740
You mother--

1530
01:55:50,740 --> 01:55:52,570
Fuck you, Marcus.
