1
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:35,383
{\an8}Hey, slow down, Mike, okay?
You're making me sick.

2
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,890
I would slow down if you
hadn't already made us late.

3
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:45,685
We're... We're not late,
okay? You're just anxious.

4
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,104
No, I'm anxious 'cause
you made us late.

5
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,398
{\an8}I'm not doin' this with you in
the next phase of our lives.

6
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:51,653
{\an8}You're gon' respect my time.

7
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,156
My stomach. My stomach.

8
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,242
{\an8}Hey, Mike, look, pull over
at that store right there.

9
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,577
I need a ginger ale.

10
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,622
{\an8}Look, we don't have no time
to get no ginger ale, man.

11
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,457
{\an8}Come on, Mike, I'm sick.

12
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,505
{\an8}You're freaking me out, okay?

13
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:12,420
I feel like I'm gonna
throw... throw up.

14
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:13,634
I dare you, Marcus.

15
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,765
You got 90 seconds, all right?

16
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,725
{\an8}Ginger ale and nothing else.

17
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:29,312
{\an8}- I am a grown-ass man, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

18
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,480
Just be nice.

19
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,861
Oh. Okay. 85 seconds.

20
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,089
Are those dogs fresh?

21
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,841
I put 'em on yesterday.

22
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:03,429
Well, give me one and put some relish
and some mustard on that motherfucker.

23
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,265
{\an8}Hook it up. Come on, hurry up.

24
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:09,356
{\an8}No, that one right there. Yeah.
Yeah, that right there. Hurry up.

25
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,438
{\an8}Gotta go, gotta go.

26
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,944
Don't be takin' your time.

27
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:16,697
Yeah, my man.

28
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,198
{\an8}Oh!

29
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,701
Hey, open the register.

30
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:24,492
- No, no, no.
- Now!

31
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,494
Sir, today is not the day.

32
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:27,745
Shut the fuck up!

33
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:31,624
Look, if I'm not in
that car in 15 seconds,

34
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:35,628
there's a very surly man that's
comin' in here and we both are fucked.

35
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,213
- Marcus.
- Hey, don't fuckin' move.

36
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,844
The fuck over there!

37
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:41,680
'Ey, Mike, I told
this guy I had to go.

38
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:42,844
Mm-mm.

39
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,512
Is that Skittles on
the counter, Marcus?

40
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:47,390
Well, he was takin' a long
time with the ginger ale.

41
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,685
That is incorrect. He grabbed that
ginger ale the second he came in here.

42
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:51,857
A hot dog, Marcus?

43
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,230
You're not supposed to
be eatin' that shit.

44
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,274
- This is not mine, Mike.
- Yes, it is.

45
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:59,819
Mind your business with
your tattletaling ass.

46
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,196
Everybody shut the fuck up!

47
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,656
Sir, I'm gonna need you
to lower your weapon.

48
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,783
Come take my weapon,
then, motherfucker.

49
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,493
Don't antagonize him.

50
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,745
Marcus, get in the car.

51
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,164
Mike, he has a gun to my head.

52
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:12,888
Wanna deal with him,
you wanna deal with me?

53
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,591
Sorry, sir, but I gotta go.

54
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,683
You didn't have to
shoot him, Mike.

55
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,270
Get in the car.

56
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,273
Call 911.

57
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,175
Aren't you the police?

58
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,534
<i>Other people look at you</i>

59
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:48,247
and see the tailored suits,
the cars, the watches.

60
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,329
I met you without any of that.

61
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,332
Stripped, basically naked...

62
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:57,710
which is 90% of why
I'm marrying you.

63
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:02,261
I met you at your lowest.

64
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,305
You'd been shot.

65
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:09,351
But there was a fire
in you that was...

66
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:11,186
...extraordinary.

67
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,900
And I vow to spend the rest
of my life fanning that flame.

68
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,821
I now pronounce you...

69
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,157
husband and wife.

70
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,573
You may kiss the bride.

71
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:27,740
Yes!

72
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:31,039
- I love it.
- Oh.

73
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:45,800
You know, it kinda makes sense that he
married his therapist after he got shot.

74
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,720
I love that for him. Mental
health is super important.

75
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:50,346
Well, it was his
physical therapist.

76
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,729
- Congratulations, Michael.
- Rita. Thank you, thank you.

77
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:55,560
Mr. Mayor.

78
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,567
Oh, not yet. Don't jinx it. I'm
still just a lowly US Attorney.

79
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,482
I've been watching
what you're doin'.

80
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,238
- You got my vote.
- Oh, thank you.

81
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:05,403
Congratulations to you.

82
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:08,577
I mean, the definition of
a power couple right there.

83
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,826
- I'll grab you a drink.
- Okay.

84
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,166
- Can I get you anything?
- No, I'm good, thank you.

85
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:18,212
And all this time, I thought
you were a terminal bachelor.

86
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:22,508
I... I... I even surprised
myself with this one.

87
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:25,798
Yeah, I guess you just
hadn't met the right one.

88
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,967
I had some growing up to do.

89
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,431
You were 50.

90
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:32,100
Uh...

91
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,019
Okay. Uh...

92
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:38,440
I'm gonna pre-apologize
for whatever he says.

93
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,065
Uh-uh...

94
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,650
- Mike.
- Uh-uh...

95
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:45,527
- No, you know how it is.
- Don't... Marcus!

96
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:47,445
- Marcus. Come...
- Let me get it out!

97
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,571
Come on, man.

98
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,740
- Everything you have been through, man.
- Okay.

99
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,825
The witch. The <i>Bruja.</i>

100
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,289
The prostitute.

101
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:58,832
My sister. 'Member? You could a
told me about my sister, Mike.

102
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:00,375
You could a told me that.

103
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:03,461
I would've embraced you, if
that's who she was feeling.

104
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:04,967
- I love you, Mike.
- No doubt.

105
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,425
You know, Cap would've loved
to have been here to see this.

106
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,760
But you know what?

107
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:15,181
We got his daughter, Judy,
and his granddaughter, Callie.

108
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,436
She wants to say something.

109
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:19,727
Um...

110
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,771
My granddad loved you guys.

111
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:26,651
And if he were here, he would
have told you not to F this up.

112
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,612
That's what he would've said.

113
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,031
Yeah, he would a said,
"Don't fuck it up."

114
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,283
Exactly.

115
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:34,826
Oh, excuse me.

116
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,206
'Ey.

117
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:41,082
Mike, you been my
partner a long time.

118
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,667
Yes, sir.

119
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:45,299
Now he's gonna be your
partner, Christine.

120
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:49,966
To Mike and Christine Lowrey.

121
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,514
- For life!
- For life!

122
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:15,491
Go Marcus! Go Marcus!
Go Marcus! Go Marcus!

123
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:27,128
Oh, shit.

124
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:33,927
What happened? What happened?!

125
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:35,261
Marcus. Marcus!

126
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,429
What's the address?

127
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,852
Let me in, let me in,
let me in. Back up.

128
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:42,940
This is Captain Rita Secada. I
have an officer in cardiac arrest.

129
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:55,160
Come on, man.

130
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:42,791
It's not your time.

131
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:38,764
Marcus!

132
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,854
Marc... Marc...!

133
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,066
This guy.

134
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,409
Hey, buddy.

135
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:04,581
What you doing?

136
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:08,001
I spent my whole life
being scared, Mike.

137
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:11,417
I wasted so much time.

138
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,710
Why... Why... Why
don't you, uh...

139
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:15,884
Why don't you just step back from
the edge a little bit, please?

140
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,428
What year is it?

141
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:20,430
It's Tuesday.

142
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:23,638
Same year your ass
was wobbling in.

143
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:26,603
Oh, wow. Felt like
it was five years.

144
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:29,727
I was in the basement
of the ocean.

145
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:32,021
All my bullshit was gone.

146
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,819
Just freedom.

147
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:37,151
And full body love,
Mike. Full body love.

148
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,319
Okay.

149
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:39,700
Why... Why... Why
don't you, uh...

150
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,825
...love your full body back
from the ledge, please?

151
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,285
Nothing to be scared of.

152
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:48,375
It's not my time,
baby. It's not my time.

153
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,544
Mr. Burnett!

154
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:52,292
Hey, I got him.

155
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:53,922
He's just, um...

156
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:59,011
I don't know what the
fuck he's doing. Uh...

157
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:02,886
But I got it. I got him.
We're good. We are good.

158
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,388
- We are great!
- 'Ey...

159
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,811
- Miami!
- Whoa!

160
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,976
305 for life!

161
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,060
Kakow!

162
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:14,147
All right. Just stop. You gon' put
somebody's eye out with that thing, man.

163
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:16,357
- I'm bringing the thunder, Mike.
- I get it.

164
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,443
Bringing the thunder.

165
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:20,361
All right. There you go.

166
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:23,072
Oh, man. Bring it in.

167
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,991
Thought I lost you, brother.

168
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:27,247
Couldn't lose me if you tried.

169
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,998
You know your ass is out, right?

170
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:34,501
Everybody's ass is out, Mike.

171
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:36,089
Hey.

172
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:38,967
There's a storm coming.

173
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,596
No. Not that kind of storm.

174
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:45,098
You're gonna be tested.

175
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,180
Things are gonna get bad,

176
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:49,978
and you're gonna have to
make a really hard choice.

177
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:53,190
Just know you're good.

178
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:21,464
This is my private
time, Mr. McGrath.

179
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:22,924
How may I help you?

180
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:25,927
- I need you to move some money.
- Your money?

181
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:28,721
Your boss's, actually. I
need it to be cartel cash.

182
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,640
Just under 20 million.

183
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:34,690
Backdated series of transfers
beginning 2004, ending January 2020...

184
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:36,567
into...

185
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:38,940
...that account.

186
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:41,989
In the name of the late
Captain Conrad Howard.

187
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,154
I have people who
can handle logistics.

188
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,870
I really just need
your login credentials.

189
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,122
And why would I give you those?

190
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:52,541
Oh, my God!

191
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:00,132
Come here, darling.

192
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:01,967
Come on.

193
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:05,554
Come here.

194
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:14,062
You can't transfer
funds from a phone.

195
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:21,320
<i>Hey, honey, what's going on?</i>

196
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:24,194
Do they know each other?

197
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:27,572
<i>Honey, who's there with you?</i>

198
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:29,203
- All right, all right!
<i>- Honey...?</i>

199
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:40,130
Here we go.

200
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:45,715
They'll kill you for this.

201
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,554
They're not even gonna
know this happened.

202
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:53,473
Your girlfriend heard you
on the phone with your wife

203
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:56,351
and realized you were
never gonna divorce her.

204
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:59,145
And in a fit of
passion, she shot you.

205
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:03,820
Your bodyguard tried to step
in, but he was too late.

206
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:08,951
And realizing the
horror of her actions...

207
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,159
she took her own life.

208
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:14,248
No!

209
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:25,880
<i>Honey, what are you doing?</i>

210
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:28,383
<i>- You had a heart attack two weeks ago.</i>
- Exactly.

211
00:15:28,387 --> 00:15:32,679
<i>They call it a widow-maker for a reason.
You need to be in the hospital, baby.</i>

212
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:34,893
Hey, I tried to told his ass, T.

213
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:39,978
Apparently, he's an adult. He
was allowed to sign hisself out.

214
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:43,815
Hey, babe. Look, come on. I couldn't
take one more second away from you.

215
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:47,193
All these stents in me
got my blood flowing.

216
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:50,113
- I'm on D way.
- All right, now.

217
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:53,950
Ey. Ey. Come on,
man. That's my phone.

218
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:56,452
<i>- I love you, Marcus.</i>
- We'll be there in 10.

219
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,542
All right, babe.
All right. Love you.

220
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:01,332
Hey, Mike.

221
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,209
I wasn't even gonna
tell you this...

222
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:05,420
but this ain't the
first time we done this.

223
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:07,213
We ride together all
the time, what you mean?

224
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:09,549
No, I'm talking about our souls.

225
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:12,635
You know, we've ridden together,
but I saw it all, Mike.

226
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,014
We're bound. And we
have been for lifetimes.

227
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:20,685
We haven't always been Mike and
Marcus, but we've always been us.

228
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:22,149
Um...

229
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,772
What you talking 'bout?

230
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:27,025
We're soulmates.

231
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:29,990
- Yup.
- Yeah.

232
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:31,779
Naw.

233
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:36,288
Yeah, I kind of... I saw my soulmate
looking a little different than that.

234
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:38,578
See... See, Mike, you
stuck in the physical.

235
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:40,538
Souls don't have dicks.

236
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,669
I'm pretty sure my soul
has a dick, Marcus.

237
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:47,090
See? That's that shit right
there. That's why we're stuck.

238
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:50,381
You know, I wasn't gonna
tell you this shit either,

239
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:53,680
but my soul is more
advanced than your soul.

240
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:55,386
Mm. Mm-hmm.

241
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,264
It's not that your
soul is stupid.

242
00:16:58,268 --> 00:16:59,390
- Mm-hmm.
- You know?

243
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:04,312
It's just that you're more
like a baby soul. You know?

244
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:06,814
And I'm more like a mother soul.

245
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,737
And I just gotta suckle ya.

246
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:11,945
You know? Put you
on that titty.

247
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:14,405
You know?

248
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:17,913
Hey. How long you think your
brain went without oxygen?

249
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,038
- Daddy!
- Daddy's home.

250
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:27,043
- Baby! Oh, baby, you're back.
- Where my family? My family.

251
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:28,423
Hey, baby.

252
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:32,549
Oh! Little Marcus!

253
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:36,723
Say hi to Pop-pop.
Say hi to Granddad.

254
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:39,305
- Oh, I missed you so...!
- Look at you, woman.

255
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:41,850
No, come on, look at me, baby.

256
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:49,232
- We're gonna have to hose them down.
- Mm!

257
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,947
All right. All right,
we get it. We get it.

258
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:55,572
Put some ice in your
drawers or somethin'.

259
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:57,369
Oh, that's funny.

260
00:17:58,287 --> 00:17:59,784
Are you feeling good, Marcus?

261
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:01,707
I never felt better in my life.

262
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:06,249
Oh, Marcus, I missed you so much,
honey, but you need to get some rest.

263
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:08,751
Oh, no, baby, I need you.

264
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,884
- Just let me get some electrolytes.
- Okay, baby. Give me a kiss.

265
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:16,176
So, what's going on with my dad?

266
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,933
Um... Well, he was
on the roof naked...

267
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:24,980
and he said he had been at
the basement of the ocean.

268
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:27,812
"Amazing Chickpeas"?

269
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:30,815
Oh, and he said I have
a stupid baby soul

270
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:32,609
- with no penis.
- Mm.

271
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:34,239
Y'all need to talk to him.

272
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,322
- Hey, Reggie.
- Yes, sir.

273
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:40,033
- Did you eat my snacks?
- No, sir.

274
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:42,247
I was looking forward
to my snacks, Reggie.

275
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:44,037
Honey.

276
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,750
You know what? You
need to get a job.

277
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:50,543
I'm a US Marine, sir.

278
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:52,128
Well, then you need to deploy.

279
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:53,838
You know, we just
got back from Yemen.

280
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:55,965
Thank you for your service.

281
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,593
- You thought I was dead, didn't you?
- Dead?

282
00:18:58,597 --> 00:19:00,140
One thing you
don't know, Reggie.

283
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,393
I got a camera up in here. Yeah.

284
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:10,484
Theresa!

285
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:14,901
It's the doctor's orders, Marcus. You're on
a strict diet. No salt, no sugar, no fats.

286
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:17,904
No stress, no loud noises,
no physical exertion.

287
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:20,073
Just sit your ass
down somewhere, man.

288
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:21,370
Tell him, Mike.

289
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,744
And, honey, I'm doing it with
you. We're now vegetarians.

290
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:27,247
Vegetarians? Look at me.

291
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:31,000
Look at all this man,
baby. I'm brand-new.

292
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:34,007
I need animal sugars to survive.

293
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:36,051
Well, baby...

294
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:38,091
I have a salad for you.

295
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:39,175
A salad?!

296
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:43,555
Hey, T, looks like you got this under
control. My tour of duty is done.

297
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,140
- Bye, Christine. Bye, Mike.
- Bye, guys.

298
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:48,480
Hey, Mike. Wait up.
Wait up, wait up.

299
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,733
What you about to do? Can
you run a quick-quick for me?

300
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:53,398
Yeah, what you need?

301
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:57,026
Um, I'll give you $1,000
for some Skittles.

302
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,158
Marcus, I am not buying
your ass no candy, man.

303
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:04,909
Okay, $2,000, Mike, for some Ding
Dongs. And that's my final offer.

304
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:07,745
I think you're gonna
be Ding Dong-less...

305
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:09,334
like my soul.

306
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:42,326
<i>You always take whoever I love.</i>

307
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:48,953
<i>This is Detective Mike Lowrey.</i>

308
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:50,042
The Captain is down.

309
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:51,623
<i>He's my son.</i>

310
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:53,962
<i>You got a fucked
up family, Mike.</i>

311
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:21,402
{\an8}<i>The Department of Justice has been investigating
the corruption in the Miami Police Department.</i>

312
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:23,947
<i>And we now have
credible intelligence</i>

313
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:27,325
{\an8}<i>that Captain Conrad Howard
was directing these elements</i>

314
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:29,536
{\an8}<i>in coordination
with the cartels.</i>

315
00:21:32,835 --> 00:21:35,458
No, I'm not interested in
<i>approximately</i> what time.

316
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:38,632
I need to know <i>exactly</i> what
time, do you understand?

317
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:40,884
You knew about this?

318
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:43,341
I found out two weeks ago.

319
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:44,926
A press conference. Really?

320
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,220
I'm sorry about the way
you had to find out.

321
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:49,931
- But given your closeness...
- Our closeness?

322
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:53,560
Neither one of y'all would have a
job if it wasn't for Captain Howard.

323
00:21:53,564 --> 00:21:55,399
Rita, you know this is not true.

324
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:57,442
Honestly, I don't.

325
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:00,567
The investigation has
turned up new evidence.

326
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:03,778
Miami law enforcement's been
a leaky ship for years now.

327
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:07,119
Witnesses turn up dead,
informants disappear.

328
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:12,161
Events appear random until you
aggregate them over a period of years.

329
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:14,164
Then a pattern emerges.

330
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:15,748
Who is this?

331
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:19,464
Bud Grice, FBI, heading
up the JTF on this show.

332
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,670
That's who I am.

333
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:24,007
Now, we knew someone was
providing intelligence

334
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:26,509
to a cartel moving product
into South Florida.

335
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,261
We just didn't know who.

336
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:32,390
A cartel banker turned up dead two
weeks ago, shot by his girlfriend.

337
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:34,809
They found a phone with
Howard's contact on it.

338
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:39,189
Years of communication with the
cartel, account references offshore.

339
00:22:39,193 --> 00:22:41,024
Millions in Howard's name.

340
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:43,318
Final piece we needed to
nail that dirty motherfucker.

341
00:22:43,322 --> 00:22:45,987
- Grice!
- Oh, whoa. Hey, hey, let me holler at you.

342
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:49,620
Um, you know I was with him
when he went down, right?

343
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:53,040
Call him dirty one more time.

344
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:54,875
I dare you.

345
00:22:57,586 --> 00:23:00,293
We know he had others who were with
him. We're gonna find them too.

346
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:01,377
I was with him.

347
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:04,547
- Put the cuffs on me right now. I was with him.
- Mike.

348
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:08,051
No, these motherfuckers think that just
'cause he's dead and can't defend hisself,

349
00:23:08,055 --> 00:23:11,262
they gon' dump all this shit
on him, burn his legacy.

350
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:12,935
Not on my watch.

351
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:20,355
This is Judy
Howard, US Marshals.

352
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:22,690
I realize I have no
jurisdiction here.

353
00:23:22,694 --> 00:23:24,359
But as a professional courtesy,

354
00:23:24,363 --> 00:23:28,446
I'd like to request visibility into the
sources of the allegations against my father.

355
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,739
Judy.

356
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:32,454
We're gonna figure this
shit out, all right?

357
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,540
How's Callie?

358
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:37,334
How do you think, Mike?

359
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:39,878
We're on the same
team here, Judy.

360
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:41,755
Like hell we are, Mike.

361
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:45,588
My dad would still be alive if
it weren't for your bastard son.

362
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:46,673
Judy...

363
00:23:46,677 --> 00:23:49,384
If I ever catch him out on the
street, I swear on my father,

364
00:23:49,388 --> 00:23:51,431
I will put him down.

365
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:54,351
Come on. Come
on, man. Come on.

366
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:00,645
So, what's our next move?

367
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:04,319
They said he was working with
the cartel. Let's ask the cartel.

368
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:16,874
How you doin'?

369
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:18,913
It's prison.

370
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:20,294
Yeah.

371
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:22,880
Look. We need your help.

372
00:24:23,881 --> 00:24:25,712
They're saying that
Captain Howard was dirty.

373
00:24:25,716 --> 00:24:27,426
Do you know anything about that?

374
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:32,014
- How much time I get off for this one?
- I'm still working on that.

375
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:35,642
This is me telling
you that I need you.

376
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:41,023
I need to know if Captain Howard
was working with the cartels.

377
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:45,694
No.

378
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:48,405
He was onto the ones that were.

379
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:51,033
So he got greenlit.

380
00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:54,240
Wait, no.

381
00:24:54,244 --> 00:24:57,410
No, Captain Howard was killed because
he was on your mother's hit list.

382
00:24:57,414 --> 00:24:59,416
He was added to it.

383
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:02,252
Your people wanted
it to look like us.

384
00:25:03,337 --> 00:25:05,502
Your people wanted him dead.

385
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:07,837
Whatchu mean, "our people"?

386
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:09,510
You should be careful.

387
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:12,971
You're playing a game and you
don't even know the rules.

388
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:16,137
- There's dirty players on your side.
- That's bullshit.

389
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:17,309
Wait, who?

390
00:25:18,227 --> 00:25:19,645
I saw him one time.

391
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:26,735
- Can you ID him?
<i>- Sí.</i>

392
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:29,234
Give me a name.

393
00:25:29,238 --> 00:25:30,656
I don't know his name.

394
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:32,241
My mother.

395
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:34,447
<i>She's the one who
dealt with him.</i>

396
00:25:35,494 --> 00:25:38,451
I knew we should have kept
that damn witch alive.

397
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:39,619
Marcus.

398
00:25:39,623 --> 00:25:41,996
May she rest in peace.

399
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,210
Dude.

400
00:25:51,093 --> 00:25:52,173
Hey, boss.

401
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:55,426
Our man on the inside got all of
Howard's records in the JTF file.

402
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:58,179
Computers, phones,
files, all of it.

403
00:25:58,183 --> 00:26:00,598
Well, we know Howard
was onto our operation.

404
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:03,142
We just don't know how much he had. We
need to make sure we got every trace.

405
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:04,523
That's beautiful.

406
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:06,817
Hey, boss.

407
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:09,774
It's all the paper files.
They're clean so far.

408
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:12,569
Two phones had nothing. His
office computer was empty.

409
00:26:12,573 --> 00:26:14,199
- He was careful.
- But?

410
00:26:14,825 --> 00:26:17,411
But his old personal
laptop had weak encryption.

411
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:20,622
Here we go.

412
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:25,210
Shit. We tripped a fail-safe.

413
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,337
The fuck you mean, "we"?

414
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:29,173
Something was sent.

415
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:31,175
To who?

416
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:33,715
Tracing the phone now.

417
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:41,556
What the hell?

418
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,641
He's texting us
from the other side.

419
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:45,814
No, he's not, Marcus.

420
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:52,905
<i>If you're seeing this...</i>

421
00:26:53,906 --> 00:26:55,069
<i>I'm probably dead.</i>

422
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:56,575
<i>Fuck!</i>

423
00:26:57,159 --> 00:26:58,160
<i>Fuck me.</i>

424
00:26:58,911 --> 00:27:00,037
<i>Before I begin...</i>

425
00:27:00,913 --> 00:27:02,535
<i>I wanna say one thing:</i>

426
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:05,167
<i>I'm putting you
in mortal danger.</i>

427
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:06,502
<i>Boys...</i>

428
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:09,459
<i>we got rats in our walls.</i>

429
00:27:09,463 --> 00:27:13,467
<i>But I gotta make sure
you're my bad boys.</i>

430
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:18,555
<i>The Coke-bottle
giant is the key.</i>

431
00:27:19,348 --> 00:27:20,345
What?

432
00:27:20,349 --> 00:27:23,018
<i>Don't trust anybody.</i>

433
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:29,399
What's that? What does that
mean? "The Coke-bottle giant."

434
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:34,029
Fletcher.

435
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:35,906
Oh, shit.

436
00:27:36,448 --> 00:27:37,528
These are the guys.

437
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:44,077
We should put a bullet in these motherfuckers.
Be done with it once and for all.

438
00:27:44,081 --> 00:27:46,996
Lintz, I love you. I'd like nothing
more than to let you loose on them.

439
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,586
But extra dead cops doesn't
do us any favors here.

440
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:54,633
<i>Keep them under constant surveillance
and see if they make a move.</i>

441
00:27:58,303 --> 00:28:00,593
Fletcher's warehouse is
right down that alley.

442
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:02,808
Mike, I wasn't even
gonna tell you this.

443
00:28:02,975 --> 00:28:04,681
Ugh. Then don't tell me.

444
00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:07,813
No, you gotta hear
this. This is big.

445
00:28:08,522 --> 00:28:10,107
I can't die.

446
00:28:10,816 --> 00:28:11,855
What?

447
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:13,940
I cannot die.

448
00:28:13,944 --> 00:28:17,990
Motherfucker, you did a pretty good job
of dying at my wedding a couple weeks ago.

449
00:28:18,115 --> 00:28:19,612
But I didn't.

450
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:20,826
Watch.

451
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:23,287
Hey, Marcus.

452
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:27,791
- Hey!
- Come on! Get out of the road!

453
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:29,543
Hey!

454
00:28:31,795 --> 00:28:32,921
Hey! Marcus!

455
00:28:34,673 --> 00:28:35,670
Hey, stop, stop.

456
00:28:35,674 --> 00:28:38,343
Hey, hey! Marcus!

457
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:39,674
What are you, some
kind of moron?!

458
00:28:39,678 --> 00:28:41,138
Stop, stop, stop.

459
00:28:43,182 --> 00:28:44,183
Police! Stop!

460
00:28:47,728 --> 00:28:50,143
- Hey!
- Bro!

461
00:28:50,147 --> 00:28:51,352
Slow down!

462
00:28:51,356 --> 00:28:52,941
Crosswalk!

463
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:55,235
Ah! Ha-ha!

464
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:58,860
Talk to me.

465
00:28:58,864 --> 00:29:00,987
- You gotta trust, Mike.
- Mm-hmm.

466
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:04,536
Trust yourself.
Trust the universe.

467
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:06,993
Stop that shit, Marcus.

468
00:29:06,997 --> 00:29:09,120
It's not my time, Mike.

469
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:13,541
Oh, okay. So you're saying that
if I shoot you in your face,

470
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:15,210
you're saying that
you won't die.

471
00:29:15,214 --> 00:29:18,588
Fate dictates that you
won't shoot me in the face.

472
00:29:18,592 --> 00:29:21,549
I'm saying... I'm... I'm
saying that you saying

473
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:25,803
that if I shoot you in your face,
are you saying you won't die?

474
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:28,352
Fate doesn't deal in
hypotheticals, Mike.

475
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:32,143
I'm gonna call the police.

476
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:34,771
They're already here,
ma'am. Mind your business.

477
00:29:34,775 --> 00:29:36,443
Just go to the beach.

478
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:38,983
Stop that shit, Marcus.

479
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:42,866
See? You're putting
your gun away.

480
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:46,245
He's putting his gun away.

481
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:53,961
Ooh, Mike.

482
00:29:58,549 --> 00:29:59,675
Focus, man.

483
00:30:00,384 --> 00:30:03,925
Yeah, I call this place, you know,
Creative Space for Black Imagination.

484
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:05,722
- You know that...
- Fletcher.

485
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,179
Oh, my God.

486
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:09,639
Thank you.

487
00:30:09,643 --> 00:30:11,395
What the hell is this place?

488
00:30:11,687 --> 00:30:15,315
This is my studio gallery.
I'm an <i>artiste</i> now.

489
00:30:15,649 --> 00:30:17,276
Please, you ain't
no damn artist.

490
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:21,860
- What do you guys want?
- Captain Howard.

491
00:30:21,864 --> 00:30:25,697
Yeah. I was sorry to hear what happened
to him. He helped turn my life around.

492
00:30:25,701 --> 00:30:27,574
He told us to talk to you.

493
00:30:27,578 --> 00:30:29,037
Okay. Talk to me.

494
00:30:29,705 --> 00:30:32,579
- I just talked to you.
- Then say what you're supposed to say.

495
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:34,372
- I said what I'm supposed to say.
- You didn't.

496
00:30:34,376 --> 00:30:37,250
- Then tell me what I'm supposed to say.
- I've said all I can say.

497
00:30:37,254 --> 00:30:39,377
Fucking with us, beanstalk?!

498
00:30:39,381 --> 00:30:41,629
Marcus! Come on!

499
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:44,424
Captain Howard saved my life.
I'm not messing this up.

500
00:30:44,428 --> 00:30:48,386
I can't say what I supposed to say
until you say what you supposed to say.

501
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,930
Fletcher, just tell us what
you supposed to tell us.

502
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:52,227
Dumbasses. Look.

503
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:55,226
Captain Howard was
onto something big.

504
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:59,647
He didn't trust that you dumb fucks
would figure it out, so he contacted me.

505
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:02,942
Because you're stupid,
and I'm a genius.

506
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:06,617
So I protected the
information in something.

507
00:31:09,328 --> 00:31:11,705
In something beautiful.

508
00:31:16,877 --> 00:31:19,209
Flex your face one more
time. Flex it again!

509
00:31:19,213 --> 00:31:22,128
I will blow your
fucking head off.

510
00:31:22,132 --> 00:31:24,801
Would you stop?! Come on.

511
00:31:25,886 --> 00:31:29,389
In something that
will live forever.

512
00:31:34,603 --> 00:31:36,226
Did you shoot him?!

513
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,353
I don't think so.

514
00:31:49,243 --> 00:31:50,281
Freeze!

515
00:31:50,285 --> 00:31:51,703
Marcus. Marcus!

516
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:23,485
You hit?

517
00:32:23,986 --> 00:32:24,899
Nah-ah.

518
00:32:24,903 --> 00:32:27,447
Black jellybean.
Nobody likes that shit.

519
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:34,580
Whoa.

520
00:32:40,836 --> 00:32:43,088
Hey! Stop that stupid shit!

521
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:50,345
I'm not fucking with you! Stop!

522
00:32:57,144 --> 00:32:59,851
No! No, no! No! No!

523
00:33:12,242 --> 00:33:14,244
I don't give a fuck!

524
00:33:14,828 --> 00:33:16,371
Marcus! No! No!

525
00:33:44,566 --> 00:33:45,897
What are you doing?!

526
00:33:45,901 --> 00:33:48,691
- I got this!
- But you don't, though.

527
00:33:48,695 --> 00:33:49,780
No. No!

528
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:52,366
Marc...!

529
00:33:56,495 --> 00:33:57,704
Let's go! Let's move!

530
00:33:59,331 --> 00:34:00,332
Marcus!

531
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:07,047
Burnett and Lowrey are
moving north on 11th.

532
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:31,780
Miami PD! Go!

533
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:36,405
- What are you doing?!
- I'm fightin' crime, baby!

534
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:37,452
Freeze!

535
00:35:04,563 --> 00:35:05,393
Mike!

536
00:35:25,334 --> 00:35:27,373
Have you ever had a
panic attack before?

537
00:35:27,377 --> 00:35:30,710
What? Ain't nobody have
no damn panic attack.

538
00:35:30,714 --> 00:35:35,590
You're at 165 over 90. Sweaty. Nauseous.
There's no shame in getting counseling.

539
00:35:35,594 --> 00:35:37,634
All right. Thank you.
Appreciate you, brother.

540
00:35:37,638 --> 00:35:39,598
Mike, let the man do his job.

541
00:35:40,516 --> 00:35:41,930
Good job, man.

542
00:35:41,934 --> 00:35:43,431
Hey, Mike.

543
00:35:43,435 --> 00:35:45,350
What the hell you
panicking about?

544
00:35:45,354 --> 00:35:46,809
I'm not speaking to you.

545
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:48,273
What'd I do?

546
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:52,106
You two all right?

547
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,816
Mike had a panic attack.

548
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,027
He didn't. Mike is fine.

549
00:35:56,031 --> 00:35:57,320
What happened?

550
00:35:57,324 --> 00:36:00,240
Rita, you ain't gonna believe
this shit. But we got a text...

551
00:36:00,244 --> 00:36:04,619
A tip. We got a tip that
Fletcher had violated his parole.

552
00:36:04,623 --> 00:36:06,579
So we came down here

553
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:09,833
and obviously he was into some
shit he ain't have no business.

554
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:11,046
Is that true, Marcus?

555
00:36:11,171 --> 00:36:12,923
Oh. Um...

556
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,511
Well, you know I was with Mike.

557
00:36:19,263 --> 00:36:23,012
How could you, of all people,
think Captain Howard was dirty?

558
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:24,681
I don't want this to be true.

559
00:36:24,685 --> 00:36:28,518
But it would benefit all of us to
do our jobs and follow the evidence.

560
00:36:28,522 --> 00:36:32,484
And you think he was stupid enough
to put accounts in his own name?

561
00:36:33,151 --> 00:36:35,692
- He's being framed.
- By who?

562
00:36:35,696 --> 00:36:37,527
That's what we're
trying to find out.

563
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:39,279
Rita, come on, you're
smarter than this.

564
00:36:39,283 --> 00:36:42,119
Michael, please do not forget
you're talking to your boss.

565
00:36:42,995 --> 00:36:44,872
I'm trying to protect you here.

566
00:36:45,414 --> 00:36:47,829
I got no footage for
a two-block radius.

567
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:49,080
What?

568
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:52,208
They must've killed all
CCTV, all security cams.

569
00:36:52,212 --> 00:36:53,293
I got nothing.

570
00:36:53,297 --> 00:36:56,049
At least they ain't
film your panic attack.

571
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,761
Hey, guys.

572
00:37:01,597 --> 00:37:02,969
- You had a panic attack?
- No.

573
00:37:02,973 --> 00:37:06,097
- If you want, I can recommend a good counselor.
- I'm good, Dorn. Thanks.

574
00:37:06,101 --> 00:37:08,979
Look, I shot this,
went frame by frame.

575
00:37:10,397 --> 00:37:11,398
Check it out.

576
00:37:12,149 --> 00:37:13,358
All right. Not here.

577
00:37:14,151 --> 00:37:15,607
- Dorn, shut it down.
- Yeah.

578
00:37:15,611 --> 00:37:16,987
Hey. Let's go.

579
00:37:19,615 --> 00:37:21,362
So, what is this?

580
00:37:21,366 --> 00:37:22,743
We're not exactly sure.

581
00:37:24,536 --> 00:37:25,700
Whoa. Uh...

582
00:37:25,704 --> 00:37:27,164
There you go. There you go.

583
00:37:27,956 --> 00:37:31,043
<i>All right, you fucks. Now
that I know it's you...</i>

584
00:37:31,835 --> 00:37:33,212
<i>here it is:</i>

585
00:37:33,921 --> 00:37:39,088
<i>I don't know how high up it goes, but
there's corrupt officials on our side.</i>

586
00:37:39,092 --> 00:37:40,840
<i>And they're working
with the cartel.</i>

587
00:37:40,844 --> 00:37:42,425
<i>This all started smelling funny</i>

588
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:44,010
<i>about nine years ago.</i>

589
00:37:44,014 --> 00:37:46,804
<i>That shipment of coke we were
about to raid went missing.</i>

590
00:37:46,808 --> 00:37:49,432
<i>You know, I kept getting
shut down from above.</i>

591
00:37:49,436 --> 00:37:53,603
<i>So I pulled Sanchez and
Ruiz outta retirement.</i>

592
00:37:53,607 --> 00:37:56,026
<i>I had 'em working on
the outside, you know?</i>

593
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,942
<i>They were killed in a
car crash a week later.</i>

594
00:37:58,946 --> 00:38:00,652
<i>That shook me up.</i>

595
00:38:00,656 --> 00:38:03,363
<i>And it's why I never
brought you two in.</i>

596
00:38:03,367 --> 00:38:07,242
<i>Well, shame on me for worrying about
your asses when you could a saved mine.</i>

597
00:38:07,246 --> 00:38:09,498
<i>But now it's up to you.</i>

598
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,622
<i>Remember the bust back in 2003?</i>

599
00:38:12,626 --> 00:38:15,420
<i>314 pounds of ecstasy?</i>

600
00:38:16,213 --> 00:38:20,046
<i>Well, I held onto the
storage unit, off the books.</i>

601
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,965
<i>That's where the real files are.</i>

602
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:24,676
<i>Everything you need to
exterminate these rat fucks.</i>

603
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,806
<i>It's in there!</i>

604
00:38:25,931 --> 00:38:28,388
<i>You're gonna have to
finish what I couldn't.</i>

605
00:38:28,392 --> 00:38:29,309
<i>Please.</i>

606
00:38:29,893 --> 00:38:31,186
<i>Please, boys.</i>

607
00:38:31,979 --> 00:38:33,397
<i>You're my last hope.</i>

608
00:38:37,276 --> 00:38:39,236
2003. Um...

609
00:38:40,195 --> 00:38:42,281
That was the
Haitians. Zoe Pound.

610
00:38:45,158 --> 00:38:46,906
Where was their storage locker?

611
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,616
I have no idea.

612
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:52,871
All right. We need you guys to go down to
the station and pull our original case files.

613
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:54,414
That'll tell us
where the locker is.

614
00:38:54,418 --> 00:38:58,126
Do it quietly and be careful.
We don't know who we can trust.

615
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:00,128
Shit, this is heavy, man.

616
00:39:00,132 --> 00:39:03,131
Um... I just got something
important to say.

617
00:39:03,135 --> 00:39:05,008
I'm just gonna come out
with it. Clear the air.

618
00:39:05,012 --> 00:39:06,930
Uh, the rat is not me.

619
00:39:09,057 --> 00:39:10,517
Thanks for that, Dorn.

620
00:39:12,728 --> 00:39:14,730
I feel safer.

621
00:40:53,036 --> 00:40:55,535
<i>They just tried to kill my son.</i>

622
00:40:55,539 --> 00:40:58,872
Because Armando can prove that
Captain Howard was innocent.

623
00:40:58,876 --> 00:41:01,040
Cap was onto these
dirty players.

624
00:41:01,044 --> 00:41:02,500
Armando told you that?

625
00:41:02,504 --> 00:41:05,420
Yes. It's the reason they
wanted Captain Howard dead.

626
00:41:05,424 --> 00:41:08,135
Armando can ID the guy that
ordered the hit on Cap.

627
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,261
He have a name?

628
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:12,514
No. But a face.

629
00:41:13,473 --> 00:41:16,097
Listen, I know y'all
can do this. All right?

630
00:41:16,101 --> 00:41:20,977
Just transfer Armando. Get him to
Miami. Get him to a secure location.

631
00:41:20,981 --> 00:41:24,651
We'll debrief him. We'll get his testimony.
We'll get some pictures in front of him.

632
00:41:24,776 --> 00:41:26,653
But please do it now.

633
00:41:26,778 --> 00:41:30,282
These guys are tryin' to cover their
asses and they are not gonna stop.

634
00:41:32,492 --> 00:41:33,952
Do it for Captain Howard.

635
00:41:36,246 --> 00:41:40,163
Look, the evidence against
Captain Howard is overwhelming.

636
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:42,628
If I'm doing this,
I'm doing it for you.

637
00:41:45,631 --> 00:41:48,296
All right, let's
transfer Aretas.

638
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:52,342
You'll accompany him, get him to
igloo here in Miami, do a debrief.

639
00:41:52,346 --> 00:41:55,182
But I'm sticking my neck
out and I'm trusting you.

640
00:41:56,099 --> 00:41:58,936
If he turns out to be bullshit,
then it's gonna be my ass.

641
00:41:59,853 --> 00:42:02,523
So don't screw me, Mike.

642
00:42:07,402 --> 00:42:08,612
Thank you.

643
00:42:09,238 --> 00:42:10,364
Thank you.

644
00:42:12,574 --> 00:42:13,700
Yeah?

645
00:42:13,825 --> 00:42:15,865
<i>We found Zoe Pound's
storage unit.</i>

646
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:18,705
<i>We'll go get the files, then take
them to my houseboat for safekeeping.</i>

647
00:42:19,373 --> 00:42:22,084
All right, stay on it. Let
me know when you got it.

648
00:42:37,641 --> 00:42:41,186
Please surrender your firearms. They
will be returned to you upon touchdown.

649
00:42:56,785 --> 00:42:57,870
You good?

650
00:42:59,162 --> 00:43:00,289
Never been better.

651
00:43:00,414 --> 00:43:01,957
It's about 45 minutes.

652
00:43:08,755 --> 00:43:10,879
Mike, I wasn't even
gonna tell you this...

653
00:43:10,883 --> 00:43:14,966
- but in one of our previous lifetimes together...
- Mm-hmm.

654
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:16,634
...you were a donkey.

655
00:43:16,638 --> 00:43:18,140
And I owned you.

656
00:43:19,141 --> 00:43:21,431
You were a stubborn ass, Mike.

657
00:43:21,435 --> 00:43:24,142
You used to bite and spit.

658
00:43:24,146 --> 00:43:25,643
- You were nasty.
- Hmm.

659
00:43:25,647 --> 00:43:30,565
But I was a terrible owner, you
know, because I used to beat you.

660
00:43:30,569 --> 00:43:33,447
- Mm-hmm.
- Because you wouldn't listen for shit.

661
00:43:33,947 --> 00:43:36,863
And maybe I beat some kind
of shame into you, Mike.

662
00:43:36,867 --> 00:43:40,495
And now I realize I
was scarring your soul.

663
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,660
You miss your nap?

664
00:43:44,082 --> 00:43:46,623
Mike, I'm trying to
apologize to you.

665
00:43:46,627 --> 00:43:49,959
We don't have your blankie, but
you could just rest your eyes.

666
00:43:49,963 --> 00:43:52,799
- That's exactly how you was as a donkey.
- Mm-kay.

667
00:43:52,925 --> 00:43:54,964
- That's that shit there.
- I get it.

668
00:43:54,968 --> 00:43:56,758
You need some help
with your seat belt?

669
00:43:56,762 --> 00:43:58,347
No, Donkey.

670
00:44:00,933 --> 00:44:04,265
Hey. Bryant, this is Bronson.

671
00:44:04,269 --> 00:44:05,938
Other guys are on turnaround.

672
00:44:06,855 --> 00:44:08,106
Take a seat.

673
00:44:29,962 --> 00:44:31,171
What's up?

674
00:44:48,272 --> 00:44:49,894
Read the lines.

675
00:44:49,898 --> 00:44:52,860
"US Marshal flight 724,
we have an emergency."

676
00:44:53,151 --> 00:44:57,610
Our prisoner has escaped custody with
the aid of Miami PD Lowrey and Burnett.

677
00:44:57,614 --> 00:44:58,907
There are officers down.

678
00:44:59,491 --> 00:45:01,531
{\an8}Mayday, mayday. They are
coming for the cockpit.

679
00:45:01,535 --> 00:45:04,409
I repeat, they are
hijacking the CH-47.

680
00:45:04,413 --> 00:45:06,623
"All ground units
please respond."

681
00:45:19,428 --> 00:45:21,638
- Give me Lowrey's gun.
- Copy.

682
00:45:33,066 --> 00:45:34,147
Go, go!

683
00:45:34,151 --> 00:45:35,319
Get Lowrey.

684
00:45:39,156 --> 00:45:40,157
Let's go!

685
00:46:06,642 --> 00:46:08,560
We welcome the
storm, motherfu...!

686
00:46:51,812 --> 00:46:53,772
Get me out of this fucking cage!

687
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:55,774
Marcus!

688
00:46:57,776 --> 00:46:58,777
Mike!

689
00:47:17,421 --> 00:47:18,668
It's too heavy!

690
00:47:18,672 --> 00:47:20,132
Don't let go!

691
00:48:00,672 --> 00:48:02,086
Grab the stick!

692
00:48:04,885 --> 00:48:06,678
Where the hell you
learn how to fly?!

693
00:48:08,055 --> 00:48:10,516
I'm a drug dealer,
man. To the right!

694
00:48:38,252 --> 00:48:39,253
Whoa!

695
00:48:54,852 --> 00:48:56,558
He was using my gun.

696
00:48:56,562 --> 00:48:59,064
How the hell did they get
on a federal transport?

697
00:49:00,065 --> 00:49:01,563
We need to split up.

698
00:49:01,567 --> 00:49:03,356
We're gonna stay together.

699
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,736
Says who?

700
00:49:06,572 --> 00:49:08,152
I'm not asking you.

701
00:49:08,156 --> 00:49:10,280
I'm telling you. We're
stayin' together.

702
00:49:10,284 --> 00:49:11,660
Fuck outta my way.

703
00:49:11,785 --> 00:49:13,912
- Hey. Where...?
- Get the fuck off me.

704
00:49:14,246 --> 00:49:15,743
Hey! Hey!

705
00:49:15,747 --> 00:49:16,828
Look.

706
00:49:16,832 --> 00:49:21,545
You are the only person who can
identify whoever is doing this!

707
00:49:21,712 --> 00:49:26,300
The only way that any of us stays alive
is if we get them before they get us.

708
00:49:26,675 --> 00:49:29,299
There's no us! There is no us!

709
00:49:29,303 --> 00:49:30,800
Damn.

710
00:49:30,804 --> 00:49:32,886
That Lowrey DNA is a bitch.

711
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:34,850
Y'all some strong motherfuckers.

712
00:49:36,226 --> 00:49:40,560
Okay. Now, look, everybody
unflex. On three.

713
00:49:40,564 --> 00:49:42,524
One! Two!

714
00:49:43,317 --> 00:49:44,401
There you go.

715
00:49:45,485 --> 00:49:50,699
Captain Howard left us files that's
gonna tell us who's doin' this.

716
00:49:51,408 --> 00:49:52,822
Dorn has 'em.

717
00:49:52,826 --> 00:49:54,786
We just have to
get back to Miami.

718
00:49:56,788 --> 00:49:58,624
You better not slow me down.

719
00:50:00,209 --> 00:50:01,752
Lose your phones.

720
00:50:02,044 --> 00:50:04,171
You keep up with me or
I leave you in the dirt.

721
00:50:04,922 --> 00:50:06,548
You're in my world now.

722
00:50:20,187 --> 00:50:22,685
Hey, Mike. Look, we
gotta think about this.

723
00:50:22,689 --> 00:50:26,981
I know you wanna move with him,
you know, because he's your "son."

724
00:50:26,985 --> 00:50:29,738
Whoa, whoa. Don't
air quote that.

725
00:50:29,863 --> 00:50:33,071
No, I didn't. I'm just sayin' I
know why you tryin' to protect him.

726
00:50:33,075 --> 00:50:34,243
'Cause he "family."

727
00:50:34,368 --> 00:50:39,081
Hey. Movin' the air quotes down to
your hips doesn't un-air-quote them.

728
00:50:39,373 --> 00:50:41,250
Just say he's my son.

729
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:43,373
- He's your son.
- No, no.

730
00:50:43,377 --> 00:50:47,589
Palms up is like you tryin' to
say, oh, he's not really my son.

731
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:51,593
Oh. Well, your
son's gettin' away.

732
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,053
Shit.

733
00:51:01,687 --> 00:51:04,894
If your men are on some kind of
op, you might wanna pull us in.

734
00:51:04,898 --> 00:51:06,984
Otherwise, it doesn't
look good for them.

735
00:51:09,027 --> 00:51:10,108
Judy.

736
00:51:10,112 --> 00:51:13,069
- You ID the bodies?
- Roger. We got three unaccounted for.

737
00:51:13,073 --> 00:51:15,492
Lowrey, Burnett and Aretas.

738
00:51:16,326 --> 00:51:18,662
Motherfuckers. Fucking...!

739
00:51:18,912 --> 00:51:19,997
Shit.

740
00:51:20,747 --> 00:51:22,165
All right. Listen up!

741
00:51:22,624 --> 00:51:26,044
We have three suspects, armed
and dangerous, out there.

742
00:51:26,795 --> 00:51:28,297
And I want them back.

743
00:51:29,047 --> 00:51:30,174
Let's go!

744
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:32,755
Hold on. Judy.

745
00:51:32,759 --> 00:51:34,178
<i>Three</i> suspects?

746
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,638
What do you think
is happening here?

747
00:51:37,639 --> 00:51:39,224
What do you think?

748
00:51:40,142 --> 00:51:41,560
Play the audio.

749
00:51:42,144 --> 00:51:44,897
<i>US Marshal flight 724,
we have an emergency.</i>

750
00:51:45,272 --> 00:51:49,397
<i>Our prisoner has escaped custody with
the aid of Miami PD Lowrey and Burnett.</i>

751
00:51:49,401 --> 00:51:51,482
<i>There are officers
down. Mayday, mayday.</i>

752
00:51:51,486 --> 00:51:55,486
Come on, you can't possibly believe
Mike and Marcus would do this.

753
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:59,286
Nah, you said it. Lowrey was obsessed
with getting his son out of prison.

754
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,330
Slow down, Judy.

755
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:03,703
This isn't Miami, Secada.

756
00:52:03,707 --> 00:52:07,165
These are my fugitives and right now
the whole world is my jurisdiction.

757
00:52:07,169 --> 00:52:09,792
You've known them your whole
life. How can you even suggest...?

758
00:52:09,796 --> 00:52:12,424
Do I think that Mike
and Marcus planned this?

759
00:52:13,091 --> 00:52:14,506
Probably not.

760
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:17,217
But people do things they wouldn't
normally do when family's involved.

761
00:52:17,221 --> 00:52:19,556
In my experience,
innocent men don't run.

762
00:52:19,681 --> 00:52:23,264
- Can we stop and think before...
- Are you capable of doing your job?

763
00:52:23,268 --> 00:52:24,937
'Cause I need to move on.

764
00:52:30,317 --> 00:52:31,610
They survived.

765
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:33,650
What the fuck you
mean, they survived?

766
00:52:33,654 --> 00:52:37,324
No bodies on site. US Marshals
are treating it as a manhunt.

767
00:52:38,534 --> 00:52:41,411
These guys just refuse to die.

768
00:52:43,372 --> 00:52:44,540
They're wanted men.

769
00:52:45,207 --> 00:52:47,956
<i>Law enforcement and media
are our friends now.</i>

770
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,666
<i>A manhunt for three fugitives</i>

771
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:51,668
{\an8}<i>is sending shock waves
across South Florida.</i>

772
00:52:51,672 --> 00:52:52,919
<i>Ballistic reports have
matched the bullets</i>

773
00:52:52,923 --> 00:52:54,258
<i>recovered from the bodies...</i>

774
00:52:54,466 --> 00:52:58,049
Are you planning on dropping out of the
mayor's race in light of the recent events?

775
00:52:58,053 --> 00:52:59,847
<i>The manhunt is
currently underway.</i>

776
00:52:59,972 --> 00:53:04,393
{\an8}<i>The FBI is assisting US Marshals
in bringing these men in.</i>

777
00:53:05,143 --> 00:53:09,978
<i>Lowrey, Burnett and Aretas should
be considered armed and dangerous.</i>

778
00:53:09,982 --> 00:53:14,399
{\an8}<i>These are individuals who have killed
fellow law enforcement professionals.</i>

779
00:53:14,403 --> 00:53:17,489
<i>If you see something,
say something.</i>

780
00:53:18,115 --> 00:53:19,950
Put a bounty on the streets.

781
00:53:20,701 --> 00:53:23,996
<i>Get it to every gang in the
city and let them fight for it.</i>

782
00:53:26,957 --> 00:53:29,247
Five mil.

783
00:53:29,251 --> 00:53:31,420
<i>Let's go get these
motherfuckers.</i>

784
00:53:40,387 --> 00:53:42,598
The universe is crazy, ain't it?

785
00:53:43,223 --> 00:53:44,641
Look at us.

786
00:53:45,392 --> 00:53:49,188
I bet none of us thought when we
woke up today this is where we'd be.

787
00:53:50,022 --> 00:53:51,811
You outta jail.

788
00:53:51,815 --> 00:53:54,568
We goin' to jail.

789
00:53:54,693 --> 00:53:56,403
This shit is special.

790
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:57,905
Mike?

791
00:53:59,281 --> 00:54:01,779
Is there anything you would
like to say to Armando?

792
00:54:01,783 --> 00:54:03,406
Fuck you talkin' to
me like that? No.

793
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:07,122
Mike, this is a moment.
Express with your son.

794
00:54:16,632 --> 00:54:17,629
I'm sorry.

795
00:54:17,633 --> 00:54:20,757
That's what I'm talking about.

796
00:54:20,761 --> 00:54:23,305
- For what?
- For everything, man.

797
00:54:24,264 --> 00:54:27,726
Seems like bad shit happens
to anybody I love, so...

798
00:54:28,227 --> 00:54:29,891
Startin' to think
maybe I'm cursed.

799
00:54:29,895 --> 00:54:31,605
I just feel like...

800
00:54:32,439 --> 00:54:33,774
maybe I cursed you.

801
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,903
You ain't fuckin' cursed me.

802
00:54:38,362 --> 00:54:40,155
Bad shit happens to everybody.

803
00:54:41,365 --> 00:54:42,741
Ain't always about you.

804
00:54:43,867 --> 00:54:44,910
Hey, Armando.

805
00:54:45,536 --> 00:54:49,498
I don't know if I told you this,
but I died a couple of weeks ago.

806
00:54:50,832 --> 00:54:52,121
Sorry to hear about that.

807
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:54,837
Oh, no. The best thing
that ever happened to me.

808
00:54:55,087 --> 00:54:56,417
Shit's wild.

809
00:54:56,421 --> 00:54:57,923
But y'all?

810
00:54:58,882 --> 00:55:00,547
Y'all the reason I came back.

811
00:55:00,551 --> 00:55:01,760
Hey.

812
00:55:02,344 --> 00:55:04,968
Everybody, bring it in.

813
00:55:04,972 --> 00:55:07,850
Come on, bring it in. Come on.

814
00:55:08,892 --> 00:55:10,060
What?

815
00:55:10,561 --> 00:55:11,895
There you go, Armando.

816
00:55:12,479 --> 00:55:13,935
There you go. There you...

817
00:55:13,939 --> 00:55:16,692
Y'all are some terrible
fuckin' fugitives.

818
00:55:19,653 --> 00:55:21,864
So, what are you,
fuckin' Marcus Winfrey?

819
00:55:22,114 --> 00:55:23,820
- What?
- Now, see?

820
00:55:23,824 --> 00:55:26,384
You makin' us look soft, like we
don't know how to be on the run.

821
00:55:39,715 --> 00:55:41,592
Better get you out of this.

822
00:55:42,551 --> 00:55:43,552
Hey!

823
00:55:44,303 --> 00:55:47,097
- That boy hardheaded.
- Chip off the old block.

824
00:56:06,491 --> 00:56:08,952
Well, what we got here?

825
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:11,997
Hey, Cain, come
take a look at this!

826
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,371
What are you boys doin'?

827
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:16,543
"Boys"?

828
00:56:16,877 --> 00:56:19,296
- Are y'all stealing our clothes?
- Looks like it.

829
00:56:19,421 --> 00:56:21,006
Fuckin' racism.

830
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:25,048
Y'all think just because we
Black, we stealin' your shit?

831
00:56:25,052 --> 00:56:27,926
Now, these are my
own Black clothes

832
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:31,850
that I put on today from
my own Black closet.

833
00:56:31,975 --> 00:56:33,097
- Marcus!
- What?

834
00:56:33,101 --> 00:56:34,269
Look at your shirt.

835
00:56:41,735 --> 00:56:43,111
How'd this get in
my Black closet?

836
00:56:44,112 --> 00:56:46,949
Why don't you boys sing
us a little Reba song.

837
00:56:49,535 --> 00:56:51,954
- Reba?
- Reba? Oh, yeah.

838
00:56:52,829 --> 00:56:55,165
Oh, please.

839
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:57,664
That's... 'Cause he put...
He put me on to Reb...

840
00:56:57,668 --> 00:56:59,833
Which one? Which
y'all...? Which one?

841
00:56:59,837 --> 00:57:01,296
Sing your favorite.

842
00:57:02,005 --> 00:57:05,505
- Oh, she got plenty of them.
- 'Cause she got hits.

843
00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:09,384
- Was it the up-tempo song? Or the slow jam?
- Yeah, yeah, remember the one?

844
00:57:09,388 --> 00:57:12,095
- It was the slow one, nigga.
- Oh, okay.

845
00:57:12,099 --> 00:57:13,930
<i>You hurt me in the morning</i>

846
00:57:13,934 --> 00:57:15,102
Yes, 'cause she was hurt.

847
00:57:15,227 --> 00:57:16,516
<i>You hurt me at night</i>

848
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:17,479
Yes, yes.

849
00:57:17,604 --> 00:57:19,978
<i>But I've changed - Changed</i>

850
00:57:19,982 --> 00:57:22,021
<i>And I'm strong, I'm a woman</i>

851
00:57:22,025 --> 00:57:23,402
<i>I'm a strong Black wom...</i>

852
00:57:23,527 --> 00:57:24,816
<i>I'm a strong woman</i>

853
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:26,818
Yeah, 'cause she's not Black.

854
00:57:29,533 --> 00:57:30,617
And then...

855
00:57:30,826 --> 00:57:32,532
<i>What you gonna do?</i>

856
00:57:32,536 --> 00:57:33,908
<i>What you gonna d...?</i>

857
00:57:33,912 --> 00:57:35,163
Mmh-mmh.

858
00:57:35,289 --> 00:57:36,915
That ain't no Reba song.

859
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:39,247
It's from her mix tape.

860
00:57:47,926 --> 00:57:49,428
Goddamn it!

861
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:53,845
We're sorry! We'll
bring it back!

862
00:57:53,849 --> 00:57:57,227
We're not stealing your
shit because we Black!

863
00:58:10,657 --> 00:58:12,409
Did you ever love her?

864
00:58:14,453 --> 00:58:15,704
What?

865
00:58:16,538 --> 00:58:18,373
My mother. You ever love her?

866
00:58:19,374 --> 00:58:21,251
He's expressing.

867
00:58:23,003 --> 00:58:24,546
I definitely loved her.

868
00:58:25,172 --> 00:58:26,757
And then you sold her out.

869
00:58:27,799 --> 00:58:29,134
I made some mistakes.

870
00:58:29,551 --> 00:58:30,677
Like me.

871
00:58:30,802 --> 00:58:34,427
- You know that is not what I was trying...
- Now wait a damn minute, Armando.

872
00:58:34,431 --> 00:58:36,137
He's trying to make up for it.

873
00:58:36,141 --> 00:58:37,889
He don't owe you a damn thing.

874
00:58:37,893 --> 00:58:41,396
All right, hold on. Hold on, Marcus.
You're just... You're being aggressive.

875
00:58:41,522 --> 00:58:44,437
I've been a dad a long time.
He needs to hear this, Mike.

876
00:58:44,441 --> 00:58:46,151
He needs some tough-ass love.

877
00:58:46,276 --> 00:58:50,527
Armando. Maybe he does
owe you something. Okay?

878
00:58:50,531 --> 00:58:52,449
Your mom being deceived by him.

879
00:58:52,574 --> 00:58:56,411
You being born in
prison, in a web of lies

880
00:58:56,537 --> 00:59:00,958
that turned your ass into a
stone-cold fuckin' killer.

881
00:59:02,292 --> 00:59:04,628
Yeah. You're a killer.

882
00:59:06,213 --> 00:59:10,801
But this man, through it all,
has been nothing but solid.

883
00:59:13,136 --> 00:59:15,385
That's some father-of-the-year
shit right there.

884
00:59:15,389 --> 00:59:16,974
Is it?

885
00:59:20,227 --> 00:59:22,396
Your wack-ass parenting
broke the truck.

886
00:59:23,355 --> 00:59:24,439
My bad.

887
00:59:25,566 --> 00:59:27,230
Yeah, nah, that's dead.

888
00:59:27,234 --> 00:59:28,731
We're not far from Tabitha's.

889
00:59:28,735 --> 00:59:30,859
No, Mike. You know
that woman's crazy.

890
00:59:30,863 --> 00:59:32,443
Yeah, but she likes me.

891
00:59:32,447 --> 00:59:34,658
I don't think she likes
you as much as you think.

892
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:37,407
- The Pony's about two miles from here.
- What's The Pony?

893
00:59:47,713 --> 00:59:52,301
I need my Instagram. I need my
Friendster. I need more sex.

894
00:59:52,426 --> 00:59:54,591
I need more men in this club.

895
00:59:54,595 --> 00:59:57,014
You all look beautiful.
Now get back to work.

896
00:59:57,306 --> 01:00:00,597
Mike Lowrey. Damn.

897
01:00:00,601 --> 01:00:01,768
What up, Tabitha?

898
01:00:04,229 --> 01:00:05,439
So y'all in trouble, huh?

899
01:00:05,606 --> 01:00:07,687
Yeah, we need some help. Um...

900
01:00:07,691 --> 01:00:09,606
- We need some clothes.
- No shit.

901
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:11,403
A ride and some phones.

902
01:00:11,528 --> 01:00:13,280
Yeah. Guns too.

903
01:00:13,947 --> 01:00:16,116
Uh, that's my son.
That's Armando.

904
01:00:16,533 --> 01:00:18,202
You got you a
little Spanish son?

905
01:00:18,327 --> 01:00:20,537
Yeah, it's a long story.

906
01:00:20,996 --> 01:00:22,247
Um, can you hook us up?

907
01:00:23,248 --> 01:00:25,834
I mean, I got all that but
what you gonna do for me?

908
01:00:25,959 --> 01:00:27,874
What you mean? We good for that.

909
01:00:27,878 --> 01:00:29,213
You were.

910
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,212
But you guys are men
on the run now, so...

911
01:00:32,216 --> 01:00:33,675
Well, what you need?

912
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,427
- What I need?
- Mm-hmm.

913
01:00:36,887 --> 01:00:38,680
I need you to eat this pussy.

914
01:00:40,349 --> 01:00:41,433
Oh!

915
01:00:42,351 --> 01:00:43,848
I'm not doin' that, all right?

916
01:00:43,852 --> 01:00:47,143
Whoa, hold on, Mike, hold
on. Think about this.

917
01:00:47,147 --> 01:00:50,730
- Now, you say guns and phones, right?
- Mm-hmm.

918
01:00:50,734 --> 01:00:52,778
Okay, well, look, you
know Mike's a married man.

919
01:00:53,195 --> 01:00:54,317
So?

920
01:00:54,321 --> 01:00:56,861
So he's gonna need some
plausible deniability.

921
01:00:56,865 --> 01:01:00,907
So I'mma have you lay down
and stick out your tongue.

922
01:01:00,911 --> 01:01:02,704
And you gonna have
to do the rest.

923
01:01:02,829 --> 01:01:04,452
I can fuck with that.

924
01:01:04,456 --> 01:01:07,163
- Oh, yeah, go on, baby.
- No, Marcus.

925
01:01:07,167 --> 01:01:10,546
- All you gotta do is close your eyes, Mike.
- No!

926
01:01:10,671 --> 01:01:13,336
I'mma need pictures. You know
how to take pictures, right?

927
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:16,798
Hey. We don't have a lot of time.
I need you to stop fuckin' around.

928
01:01:16,802 --> 01:01:18,341
Oh, I'm not fuckin' around.

929
01:01:18,345 --> 01:01:19,843
All right, hey, let's go.

930
01:01:19,847 --> 01:01:21,052
Wait, hold up.

931
01:01:21,056 --> 01:01:23,638
Sit your motherfuckin' ass down.

932
01:01:23,642 --> 01:01:25,890
- Hey, Tabitha, what is you doin'?
- What is <i>you</i> doin'?!

933
01:01:25,894 --> 01:01:29,231
Sit your married ass down!
You get y'all asses down too!

934
01:01:29,356 --> 01:01:30,941
- Shit.
- Everybody sit down.

935
01:01:31,441 --> 01:01:34,111
Hey, I got the bad boys right
here. Let's get that money.

936
01:01:34,528 --> 01:01:36,655
- Hey, Tab.
- Shut the fuck up.

937
01:01:36,822 --> 01:01:38,907
Hold up, I'm confused.

938
01:01:39,575 --> 01:01:40,989
You didn't want
him to licky-licky?

939
01:01:40,993 --> 01:01:43,245
There's a $5 million
bounty on your head.

940
01:01:43,412 --> 01:01:45,368
I need that money.
I was just stalling.

941
01:01:45,372 --> 01:01:48,584
That's... That's cold.
He almost did that shit.

942
01:01:48,709 --> 01:01:49,956
He did not, Marcus.

943
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:52,083
I told you she didn't like you.

944
01:01:52,087 --> 01:01:53,505
Get the fuck up.

945
01:01:59,553 --> 01:02:01,346
The bounty is dead or alive.

946
01:02:02,097 --> 01:02:03,390
Don't be stupid.

947
01:02:06,894 --> 01:02:08,099
Hey, Armando.

948
01:02:08,103 --> 01:02:10,314
If you live, I'll let you...

949
01:02:11,523 --> 01:02:12,524
What?

950
01:02:12,691 --> 01:02:15,402
I said if you live,
motherfucker, holler at me.

951
01:02:17,279 --> 01:02:18,651
He was kinda cute.

952
01:02:22,075 --> 01:02:23,243
We got a tip.

953
01:02:23,994 --> 01:02:25,996
Positive ID on our fugitives.

954
01:02:26,163 --> 01:02:27,331
Let's do this.

955
01:02:32,753 --> 01:02:36,173
Ooh! Mike, I'm about
to make my move.

956
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:39,631
No, the fuck you're not. You about to
go wherever these men are taking us.

957
01:02:39,635 --> 01:02:40,882
Oh, I'm not goin'.

958
01:02:40,886 --> 01:02:44,056
Now I'll take the three in the
front, you take the six in the back.

959
01:02:44,473 --> 01:02:46,350
Marcus, we do not
have any weapons.

960
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:50,145
In five... four... three...

961
01:02:50,437 --> 01:02:51,688
Fuck!

962
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:13,544
Ah, shit! This motherfucker.

963
01:03:13,961 --> 01:03:16,417
<i>Fuckboy, fuckboy
Whatcha gonna do?</i>

964
01:03:16,421 --> 01:03:17,919
Ayo, Mike!

965
01:03:17,923 --> 01:03:20,342
Ain't no fun when the
rabbit got the gun, huh?

966
01:03:20,592 --> 01:03:21,923
Wait, you know this guy?

967
01:03:21,927 --> 01:03:23,883
Yeah, I hit him with a
hammer a couple years ago.

968
01:03:23,887 --> 01:03:27,971
You think I forgot about that fucking ho
shit you pulled off at Manny's Prime Rib?

969
01:03:27,975 --> 01:03:29,977
How the fuck did I
let you two catch me?

970
01:03:30,394 --> 01:03:32,183
Mike, I want my five million.

971
01:03:32,187 --> 01:03:33,730
Marcus!

972
01:03:33,897 --> 01:03:36,646
You see I got the fam
with me. The streets!

973
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:39,570
We could do this nice and
easy or we can go to war!

974
01:03:40,028 --> 01:03:41,280
'Cause I'm fucking war-ready!

975
01:03:41,989 --> 01:03:43,323
What are you doing?!

976
01:03:45,117 --> 01:03:46,072
No!

977
01:03:56,378 --> 01:03:58,130
Go, go, go, go!

978
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:05,470
Back up! Back up! Back up!

979
01:04:10,058 --> 01:04:11,472
No! No!

980
01:04:11,476 --> 01:04:14,855
Windshield wiper
fluid is flammable!

981
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:18,817
How the hell am I supposed to know
that?! I ain't no damn scientist!

982
01:04:24,072 --> 01:04:27,117
Everybody relax. The
fire's on the outside.

983
01:04:28,911 --> 01:04:30,825
- Oh!
- Oh, shit!

984
01:04:30,829 --> 01:04:32,748
Now it's on the inside!

985
01:04:35,834 --> 01:04:36,752
Shit!

986
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,045
Okay.

987
01:04:39,588 --> 01:04:41,340
Okay.

988
01:05:10,702 --> 01:05:13,580
Everybody out! Everybody out!

989
01:05:40,983 --> 01:05:42,317
Shit.

990
01:05:55,372 --> 01:05:56,999
Open the damn door!

991
01:05:59,835 --> 01:06:02,212
We can feel you right
there, boy. Open the door.

992
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:11,050
Hey!

993
01:06:11,054 --> 01:06:12,806
Open up, Muscle Milk.

994
01:06:13,182 --> 01:06:15,013
Come on, man. What
the fuck is you doing?

995
01:06:15,017 --> 01:06:17,932
Nothing. It's just not a great
time for me right now, guys.

996
01:06:17,936 --> 01:06:19,350
It's not a great
time for us either.

997
01:06:19,354 --> 01:06:21,269
Okay, let's reconvene
in like an hour or so.

998
01:06:21,273 --> 01:06:23,062
Babe, we're out of body wash.

999
01:06:23,066 --> 01:06:24,226
- Oh!
- Whoa!

1000
01:06:24,401 --> 01:06:25,903
What the hell?

1001
01:06:26,862 --> 01:06:28,071
We found you guys.

1002
01:06:30,032 --> 01:06:31,575
We're in a relationship. Okay?

1003
01:06:32,492 --> 01:06:33,823
- Oh, okay.
- All right.

1004
01:06:33,827 --> 01:06:35,366
Sneaking around has
been destroying me.

1005
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:38,703
It started about a couple months ago. It
will not affect our professional lives.

1006
01:06:38,707 --> 01:06:40,580
Except for that one
time in that van.

1007
01:06:40,584 --> 01:06:43,416
- I am not sorry.
- Nothing to be sorry about.

1008
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:45,881
Yeah, you know. I mean,
people do that shit.

1009
01:06:46,173 --> 01:06:48,733
- Are you guys okay?
- Yeah, we're good. I wanted to... Oh.

1010
01:06:50,636 --> 01:06:52,592
- What the fuck?!
- Okay. Whoa, whoa.

1011
01:06:52,596 --> 01:06:54,640
Hey, Kelly. Kelly.

1012
01:06:55,307 --> 01:06:57,555
I asked you to wait
outside for a second.

1013
01:06:57,559 --> 01:07:00,020
All right. Kelly, he's with us.

1014
01:07:00,604 --> 01:07:01,559
He can't be here.

1015
01:07:01,563 --> 01:07:03,524
This is my son, Armando.

1016
01:07:03,815 --> 01:07:06,777
I know who he is, and
that's why he can't be here.

1017
01:07:06,944 --> 01:07:10,239
I trust you with my life, Mike. But
I as sure as shit don't trust him.

1018
01:07:10,364 --> 01:07:11,361
I trust him.

1019
01:07:11,365 --> 01:07:13,492
Then take him to your house.

1020
01:07:15,077 --> 01:07:17,617
Hey, Mike. Uh, can I have
a second with her, please?

1021
01:07:17,621 --> 01:07:18,743
Yeah, yeah. Please.

1022
01:07:18,747 --> 01:07:20,582
- Hey, sweetie.
- Relax. Relax.

1023
01:07:20,749 --> 01:07:22,909
Come here for a sec. Come
over here for a second.

1024
01:07:25,754 --> 01:07:27,335
We could both end up in jail.

1025
01:07:31,552 --> 01:07:34,638
- Give him a chance.
- Yeah, give him a chance to kill us all?

1026
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:37,683
This is some dysfunctional shit.

1027
01:07:40,519 --> 01:07:42,896
- She's fine.
- She don't look fine.

1028
01:07:43,063 --> 01:07:45,023
- I'm fine.
- Yes, you are.

1029
01:07:46,191 --> 01:07:47,981
- The fuck you say?
- All right, all right.

1030
01:07:47,985 --> 01:07:50,988
- It's the language barrier.
- It was English.

1031
01:07:51,572 --> 01:07:52,656
It was definitely English.

1032
01:07:58,662 --> 01:07:59,705
Thanks for the drip.

1033
01:08:00,581 --> 01:08:02,912
Yeah. Okay, we're
aggregating all the data.

1034
01:08:02,916 --> 01:08:06,124
There's over 100 hours of
video, 200 units of audio.

1035
01:08:06,128 --> 01:08:09,752
We're indexing all audio, video
and geo-located IP network data

1036
01:08:09,756 --> 01:08:12,384
to create a sight picture
and develop a target package.

1037
01:08:12,509 --> 01:08:15,633
Basically, you sifting through all this
shit to find the guilty motherfucker.

1038
01:08:15,637 --> 01:08:16,805
Bingo.

1039
01:08:17,555 --> 01:08:18,428
Hey, Dorn.

1040
01:08:18,432 --> 01:08:22,685
Can you safely get me into my
Ring app? I wanna see my family.

1041
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:25,772
Yeah, we got our own VPN and
router. What's your username?

1042
01:08:25,898 --> 01:08:27,441
Marcus37.

1043
01:08:27,608 --> 01:08:28,524
And password?

1044
01:08:29,109 --> 01:08:31,028
Snickers89.

1045
01:08:37,951 --> 01:08:39,870
Almost home, baby.

1046
01:08:40,245 --> 01:08:42,485
Hey, let's get to work. We
got a lot to get through here.

1047
01:08:42,622 --> 01:08:44,457
So, what exactly
are we looking for?

1048
01:08:44,957 --> 01:08:47,294
<i>We're looking for the guy
who ordered the hit on Cap.</i>

1049
01:08:47,711 --> 01:08:49,462
<i>Armando can ID him.</i>

1050
01:08:55,385 --> 01:08:58,091
<i>This fucking bastard
has been my white whale.</i>

1051
01:08:58,095 --> 01:09:02,309
<i>For the last nine years, I've been
trying to harpoon the son of a bitch.</i>

1052
01:09:02,475 --> 01:09:04,520
<i>But now it's up to you.</i>

1053
01:09:23,663 --> 01:09:26,875
Ey-Ey-Ey. Do I walk into your house
and show you how to make cocaine?

1054
01:09:27,042 --> 01:09:28,167
Blow it up.

1055
01:09:36,218 --> 01:09:37,261
It's him.

1056
01:09:43,725 --> 01:09:44,768
You sure?

1057
01:09:45,352 --> 01:09:47,112
That's the guy that
ordered the hit.

1058
01:09:47,187 --> 01:09:48,604
Bam. Got a name.

1059
01:09:49,231 --> 01:09:52,401
James McGrath. Army Ranger
School, counterintelligence.

1060
01:09:52,526 --> 01:09:55,070
<i>Deployed in Mexico until 2005.</i>

1061
01:09:55,362 --> 01:09:58,111
Worked with the DEA,
Defense Attache's office.

1062
01:09:58,115 --> 01:09:59,157
Oh, shit.

1063
01:09:59,449 --> 01:10:03,241
He was taken hostage by
your friends, the cartel.

1064
01:10:03,245 --> 01:10:06,164
He gave up his entire
squad "under duress."

1065
01:10:06,331 --> 01:10:07,583
It's called torture, man.

1066
01:10:08,542 --> 01:10:10,252
He was the only survivor.

1067
01:10:15,215 --> 01:10:16,800
<i>Cap had him the whole time.</i>

1068
01:10:16,967 --> 01:10:18,135
He just didn't know it.

1069
01:10:22,055 --> 01:10:22,890
Hello.

1070
01:10:23,015 --> 01:10:24,725
Hey. It's me.

1071
01:10:24,975 --> 01:10:27,477
Damn it, Michael. Where are you?

1072
01:10:27,978 --> 01:10:31,356
Rita, we're coming in. We got proof
that Captain Howard is innocent.

1073
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:33,233
What proof?

1074
01:10:33,358 --> 01:10:36,399
We got the guy that had
Captain Howard killed.

1075
01:10:36,403 --> 01:10:37,692
<i>Armando ID'd him.</i>

1076
01:10:37,696 --> 01:10:40,904
<i>Same dude that attacked us on
the chopper. James McGrath.</i>

1077
01:10:40,908 --> 01:10:43,573
Rita, we got ten
years' worth of files.

1078
01:10:43,577 --> 01:10:46,784
Cap was investigating these dudes.
We got 'em all. It's a whole network.

1079
01:10:46,788 --> 01:10:48,790
<i>We'll surrender to you tomorrow.</i>

1080
01:10:49,583 --> 01:10:51,206
<i>Hey, look, we gotta go.</i>

1081
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:53,003
Michael, what...?

1082
01:10:56,089 --> 01:10:57,216
You okay?

1083
01:10:57,591 --> 01:10:58,425
Uh...

1084
01:10:58,592 --> 01:11:00,131
They're coming in.

1085
01:11:00,135 --> 01:11:01,341
What?

1086
01:11:01,345 --> 01:11:04,806
Michael says they have proof
that exonerates Howard...

1087
01:11:05,516 --> 01:11:06,892
explains everything.

1088
01:11:09,436 --> 01:11:10,562
Do you still love him?

1089
01:11:11,813 --> 01:11:12,814
What?

1090
01:11:13,398 --> 01:11:14,441
No.

1091
01:11:15,108 --> 01:11:16,527
But I believe him.

1092
01:11:17,736 --> 01:11:19,321
Just be careful, babe.

1093
01:11:21,406 --> 01:11:22,612
Still going to dinner?

1094
01:11:22,616 --> 01:11:23,825
Yeah.

1095
01:11:27,955 --> 01:11:29,122
<i>They have the files.</i>

1096
01:11:29,331 --> 01:11:32,121
We need to make this look like
cartel business. Spanish only.

1097
01:11:36,338 --> 01:11:38,131
Ammo's ready to go. Let's go.

1098
01:11:48,725 --> 01:11:51,144
{\an8}We only need one hostage.

1099
01:11:52,104 --> 01:11:53,544
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1100
01:11:54,481 --> 01:11:56,567
You guys! We got a problem.

1101
01:11:58,110 --> 01:12:00,946
Miami Central, Miami
Central. 29 in progress.

1102
01:12:01,363 --> 01:12:03,194
Oh shit, that's my house.

1103
01:12:03,198 --> 01:12:05,655
Please advise, MOS residence.

1104
01:12:05,659 --> 01:12:07,031
Respond forthwith.

1105
01:12:07,035 --> 01:12:08,120
Fuck.

1106
01:12:08,287 --> 01:12:11,540
Fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, no.

1107
01:12:11,748 --> 01:12:12,958
Come on, Christine.

1108
01:12:21,383 --> 01:12:23,343
- Shit.
- Get a unit over to my house.

1109
01:12:24,052 --> 01:12:26,301
Come on, Reggie!
Pick up! Pick up.

1110
01:12:26,305 --> 01:12:28,428
Miami Central, we have
another 29 in progress.

1111
01:12:28,432 --> 01:12:31,264
Please send units to Detective
Lowrey's home address.

1112
01:12:31,268 --> 01:12:33,729
<i>Enemy's down!</i>

1113
01:12:34,688 --> 01:12:37,024
Reggie! You got incoming.

1114
01:12:37,191 --> 01:12:39,689
<i>- Get the family to somewhere safe.</i>
- What?

1115
01:12:39,693 --> 01:12:41,236
<i>- Now!</i>
- Yes, sir.

1116
01:12:45,032 --> 01:12:46,946
- What's happening?
- What's going on?

1117
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:49,912
There's people comin' in the
house. I gotta keep y'all safe.

1118
01:12:54,458 --> 01:12:55,455
Please be careful!

1119
01:12:55,459 --> 01:12:57,939
- Okay, Reggie, what's happening? Okay.
- Trust me. I love you.

1120
01:12:57,961 --> 01:12:59,417
Fuck! Fuck!

1121
01:13:12,309 --> 01:13:13,810
Behind you, Reg!

1122
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:16,480
Oh, damn!

1123
01:13:25,489 --> 01:13:28,242
- Who the fuck is this guy?!
- That's my boy! That's my boy!

1124
01:13:30,702 --> 01:13:31,662
Ooh.

1125
01:13:34,873 --> 01:13:36,667
Damn!

1126
01:13:37,417 --> 01:13:38,961
Come on, come on, come on.

1127
01:13:52,599 --> 01:13:53,642
Ooh!

1128
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:01,400
No, no, no!

1129
01:14:03,110 --> 01:14:04,695
- Whoo!
- Holy shit!

1130
01:14:09,157 --> 01:14:10,325
Come on, come on!

1131
01:14:17,207 --> 01:14:18,417
Holy shit!

1132
01:14:24,214 --> 01:14:26,546
Oh! Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang,
motherfuckers.

1133
01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:28,339
Me snacks is your
snacks, Reggie.

1134
01:14:28,343 --> 01:14:29,761
<i>All right, come on.</i>

1135
01:14:33,473 --> 01:14:35,180
Mike, did you see that shit?

1136
01:14:35,184 --> 01:14:36,852
Pick up the phone.

1137
01:14:37,853 --> 01:14:40,272
Whoa, Mike! Mike! Mike!

1138
01:14:46,361 --> 01:14:47,362
One second.

1139
01:14:52,284 --> 01:14:53,281
Callie.

1140
01:14:53,285 --> 01:14:55,662
I saw it on TV. My mom
is after Uncle Mike.

1141
01:14:55,829 --> 01:14:58,745
There is no way that he did
everything that they're saying.

1142
01:14:58,749 --> 01:14:59,958
Sweetheart.

1143
01:15:01,919 --> 01:15:04,213
Everything is going to be okay.

1144
01:15:04,338 --> 01:15:06,298
Okay? Okay?

1145
01:15:18,477 --> 01:15:20,395
- Hello?
- It's me. Get out of the house.

1146
01:15:21,271 --> 01:15:24,020
- I've got Callie with me.
- Take her and go! Get out now!

1147
01:15:26,527 --> 01:15:28,028
Callie, get behind me.

1148
01:15:29,738 --> 01:15:30,822
Mike.

1149
01:15:36,537 --> 01:15:37,454
Christine!

1150
01:15:47,673 --> 01:15:48,757
Mr. Lowrey.

1151
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:51,593
Who am I speaking to?

1152
01:15:51,844 --> 01:15:53,971
I think you know who
you're speaking to.

1153
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:56,515
<i>I need your boy...</i>

1154
01:15:57,850 --> 01:16:01,144
<i>and whatever evidence your beloved
captain had squirreled away.</i>

1155
01:16:01,687 --> 01:16:04,811
And for that, you
can have your wife.

1156
01:16:04,815 --> 01:16:06,733
<i>I'll call you back
with instructions.</i>

1157
01:16:08,235 --> 01:16:09,987
Aw, shit.

1158
01:16:10,946 --> 01:16:13,532
Goddamn it.

1159
01:16:14,533 --> 01:16:16,618
I'll go.

1160
01:16:21,373 --> 01:16:22,916
Let my life be worth something.

1161
01:16:25,544 --> 01:16:26,545
Never.

1162
01:16:29,339 --> 01:16:30,424
Never.

1163
01:16:38,348 --> 01:16:39,516
Mike.

1164
01:16:41,018 --> 01:16:42,265
He knew.

1165
01:16:42,269 --> 01:16:43,729
What do you mean?

1166
01:16:44,938 --> 01:16:46,644
He knew we were comin' in.

1167
01:16:46,648 --> 01:16:49,026
He knew we had Captain
Howard's files.

1168
01:16:49,526 --> 01:16:51,653
He knew we had ID'd him.

1169
01:16:52,154 --> 01:16:53,155
How?

1170
01:16:53,906 --> 01:16:56,033
Only person you
spoke to was Rita.

1171
01:16:57,201 --> 01:16:58,493
It's not Rita.

1172
01:17:01,455 --> 01:17:03,874
Damn, she got bad taste in men.

1173
01:17:04,124 --> 01:17:05,538
<i>Justice has been investigating</i>

1174
01:17:05,542 --> 01:17:07,753
<i>the corruption in the
Miami Police Department...</i>

1175
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,502
<i>...with reports suggesting the
late Captain Conrad Howard...</i>

1176
01:17:10,506 --> 01:17:11,711
Hello?

1177
01:17:11,715 --> 01:17:14,275
<i>...was directing these elements
in coordination with the cartels.</i>

1178
01:17:14,343 --> 01:17:17,346
<i>Allegations against Howard, which
allude to include Lowrey and Burnett,</i>

1179
01:17:17,804 --> 01:17:22,263
<i>and the operation range from helping cartels
move the product into the state of Florida</i>

1180
01:17:22,267 --> 01:17:25,062
<i>as well as giving up key
witnesses, destruction of evidence,</i>

1181
01:17:25,187 --> 01:17:26,976
<i>and even the murder
of fellow officers.</i>

1182
01:17:26,980 --> 01:17:29,024
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

1183
01:17:30,484 --> 01:17:33,987
There's been a breakthrough in the
case. I need to get down to the station.

1184
01:17:36,031 --> 01:17:37,241
I'm gonna head down there.

1185
01:17:40,244 --> 01:17:41,741
I'm coming with you.

1186
01:17:55,259 --> 01:17:56,844
Who are you texting?

1187
01:17:57,344 --> 01:18:01,765
Uh, just... Just gotta get
in touch with the office.

1188
01:18:02,975 --> 01:18:04,059
JTF.

1189
01:18:05,143 --> 01:18:06,186
Gotta let everybody know.

1190
01:18:14,111 --> 01:18:15,733
Hey. Honey. Come on.

1191
01:18:15,737 --> 01:18:18,115
Honey, what are you
doing? Stop that.

1192
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:19,946
What are you doing? Stop it.

1193
01:18:19,950 --> 01:18:21,739
- Let go of me.
- What are you doing?

1194
01:18:21,743 --> 01:18:23,412
Give it back to
me. Give it back!

1195
01:18:55,611 --> 01:18:56,737
Fuck!

1196
01:18:57,529 --> 01:18:58,947
Hey, hey, come on.

1197
01:19:01,575 --> 01:19:02,618
You okay?

1198
01:19:03,035 --> 01:19:04,328
Look at the phone.

1199
01:19:14,838 --> 01:19:16,715
You know you done
fucked up, right?

1200
01:19:22,221 --> 01:19:23,472
You all right?

1201
01:19:27,726 --> 01:19:28,852
I'm sorry.

1202
01:19:30,479 --> 01:19:32,648
Ain't got nothing
to be sorry for.

1203
01:19:55,671 --> 01:19:56,922
We'll find her, boss.

1204
01:20:01,426 --> 01:20:05,931
I don't trust anybody that's not
standing right here, right now.

1205
01:20:06,849 --> 01:20:08,888
Every extra person
that we involve

1206
01:20:08,892 --> 01:20:11,728
increases the likelihood
that they know we're coming,

1207
01:20:12,646 --> 01:20:16,646
which increases the likelihood
that Christine and Callie

1208
01:20:16,650 --> 01:20:18,527
don't make it out of there.

1209
01:20:19,152 --> 01:20:23,907
That means no SWAT, no
marshals, no backup.

1210
01:20:25,492 --> 01:20:26,827
It's just us.

1211
01:20:32,249 --> 01:20:34,084
I never meant for
it to go this way.

1212
01:20:34,877 --> 01:20:36,545
How did you mean it to go?

1213
01:20:37,171 --> 01:20:40,795
After 9/11, nobody cared about
drugs coming into this country.

1214
01:20:40,799 --> 01:20:44,011
So to secure the borders we
started to work with the cartels.

1215
01:20:44,344 --> 01:20:48,094
And they kept us informed about any
terrorist activity coming our way.

1216
01:20:48,098 --> 01:20:51,602
And it worked. We haven't
had an attack since.

1217
01:20:52,352 --> 01:20:53,770
We were protecting this country.

1218
01:20:53,979 --> 01:20:58,442
You were killing cops and getting
rich putting drugs into this country.

1219
01:20:58,567 --> 01:21:00,815
- Rita.
- That's why you killed Howard.

1220
01:21:00,819 --> 01:21:02,984
He was onto you. You wanted
to cover your tracks.

1221
01:21:02,988 --> 01:21:05,282
No. That was McGrath.

1222
01:21:06,033 --> 01:21:07,697
He's out of control.

1223
01:21:07,701 --> 01:21:10,204
Rita. Just take a second.

1224
01:21:10,787 --> 01:21:13,373
I never meant for any
of this to go this way.

1225
01:21:23,383 --> 01:21:26,637
I guess I just need to
know if it was ever real.

1226
01:21:27,429 --> 01:21:29,097
It was always real.

1227
01:21:29,598 --> 01:21:32,601
I panicked. I lost control.

1228
01:21:33,227 --> 01:21:34,849
Did you love me?

1229
01:21:34,853 --> 01:21:36,146
Yes.

1230
01:21:36,813 --> 01:21:37,940
I swear.

1231
01:21:38,941 --> 01:21:40,522
Well, that means...

1232
01:21:40,526 --> 01:21:41,693
We good. We got it.

1233
01:21:41,818 --> 01:21:43,737
99% voice match.

1234
01:21:45,155 --> 01:21:48,867
...absolutely nothing to
me, you piece of shit.

1235
01:21:56,333 --> 01:21:57,973
<i>Hey. It's me.</i>

1236
01:21:58,460 --> 01:21:59,962
What the hell's going on?

1237
01:22:00,504 --> 01:22:02,214
<i>You screwed up is
what's going on.</i>

1238
01:22:02,339 --> 01:22:06,172
We've been compromised. I'll
explain when I get there.

1239
01:22:06,176 --> 01:22:09,555
<i>We're moving the hostages.
Cuba. Long-term hold...</i>

1240
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:13,892
to keep Lowrey, Burnett and Aretas
quiet while we sort this out.

1241
01:22:14,518 --> 01:22:17,729
I'm bringing a seaplane.
I'll be there at first light.

1242
01:22:22,442 --> 01:22:24,524
All right, pack this place up.

1243
01:22:24,528 --> 01:22:26,905
All equipment and
personnel prepare to move.

1244
01:22:27,698 --> 01:22:29,783
We're moving the hostages
out of the country.

1245
01:22:44,298 --> 01:22:45,799
What happened to your hand?

1246
01:22:54,433 --> 01:22:56,935
They call that a
Colombian manicure.

1247
01:23:03,025 --> 01:23:04,651
What's so great about it

1248
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:06,900
is it's the maximum
amount of pain,

1249
01:23:06,904 --> 01:23:08,280
but you don't die.

1250
01:23:13,243 --> 01:23:16,455
So now you've decided to be
the one holding the pliers.

1251
01:23:18,457 --> 01:23:20,042
Everybody breaks.

1252
01:23:21,084 --> 01:23:22,377
Everyone.

1253
01:23:22,961 --> 01:23:24,254
Your husband...

1254
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:27,174
is gonna kneel down
in front of me...

1255
01:23:27,674 --> 01:23:29,593
and beg for your lives.

1256
01:23:30,761 --> 01:23:33,263
And then you're gonna
watch me kill him.

1257
01:23:36,350 --> 01:23:38,389
You don't know my husband.

1258
01:23:38,393 --> 01:23:41,396
Well, not officially, but...

1259
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:43,774
I look forward to
seeing him again.

1260
01:23:56,745 --> 01:23:59,665
<i>Bad boys Bad boys</i>

1261
01:24:03,293 --> 01:24:04,461
Mmh-mmh.

1262
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:06,839
Come on, Mike.

1263
01:24:08,090 --> 01:24:11,176
<i>Bad boys, bad boys</i>

1264
01:24:17,015 --> 01:24:18,642
<i>Whatchu you gonna do</i>

1265
01:24:19,268 --> 01:24:20,265
Yeah.

1266
01:24:20,269 --> 01:24:23,268
<i>What you gonna do
When they come for you</i>

1267
01:24:27,192 --> 01:24:29,069
That's enough,
dawg. That's enough.

1268
01:24:29,486 --> 01:24:32,155
Okay, well, we'll
circle back on that one.

1269
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:45,623
All right. The plane is
ready. We roll in 20.

1270
01:24:45,627 --> 01:24:48,418
<i>It's an abandoned amusement park.
There should be no civilians.</i>

1271
01:24:48,422 --> 01:24:51,925
Plane is gonna land from
the south. On the one side.

1272
01:24:52,634 --> 01:24:55,133
<i>Marcus and I will
be on the plane.</i>

1273
01:24:55,137 --> 01:24:58,845
<i>Armando's gonna make his way
in the water. The two side.</i>

1274
01:24:58,849 --> 01:25:03,308
Kelly, Rita. This road is
one way in, one way out.

1275
01:25:03,312 --> 01:25:05,147
<i>You're holding that road.</i>

1276
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:08,646
<i>Dorn, you're gonna
control the air.</i>

1277
01:25:08,650 --> 01:25:12,070
<i>Drones in the air, jamming
is active, comms are secure.</i>

1278
01:25:13,071 --> 01:25:15,820
As far as they know, Lockwood
is on his way with the plane

1279
01:25:15,824 --> 01:25:18,160
<i>to move the hostages to Cuba.</i>

1280
01:25:19,244 --> 01:25:22,660
The second they get close to the plane
with the hostages, it's quick kills.

1281
01:25:22,664 --> 01:25:24,162
Neutralize all threats.

1282
01:25:24,166 --> 01:25:26,710
These motherfuckers
killed a lot of good cops.

1283
01:25:27,044 --> 01:25:28,875
<i>They have my wife,
they have Callie.</i>

1284
01:25:28,879 --> 01:25:30,839
They attacked our families.

1285
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:33,175
We not losing today.

1286
01:25:36,303 --> 01:25:37,471
Hey.

1287
01:25:38,555 --> 01:25:41,095
We get on the ground,
you even flinch,

1288
01:25:41,099 --> 01:25:43,264
you'll be dead in .24 seconds.

1289
01:25:43,268 --> 01:25:44,686
I concur.

1290
01:25:46,271 --> 01:25:48,394
<i>I got one lookout on
the platform outside.</i>

1291
01:25:48,398 --> 01:25:51,193
I got one sniper on the
roof of building two.

1292
01:25:51,568 --> 01:25:52,611
Tee those up.

1293
01:25:55,948 --> 01:25:57,362
Everybody keep moving.

1294
01:25:57,366 --> 01:25:59,117
- What are those?
- Gators.

1295
01:25:59,576 --> 01:26:02,200
I thought it was an
<i>abandoned</i> gator park.

1296
01:26:02,204 --> 01:26:03,622
Abandoned by humans.

1297
01:26:04,289 --> 01:26:05,787
It's actually an
old amusement park.

1298
01:26:05,791 --> 01:26:09,211
It sat on 10 acres, abandoned
in 2017 after Hurricane Irma.

1299
01:26:09,753 --> 01:26:14,212
<i>Their main attraction was an
albino alligator named Duke...</i>

1300
01:26:14,216 --> 01:26:17,757
...who was 16 feet
long, 900 pounds.

1301
01:26:17,761 --> 01:26:20,305
"And legend has it
he's still there."

1302
01:26:20,889 --> 01:26:22,015
Fuck that.

1303
01:26:36,697 --> 01:26:38,073
Armando's at his QTH.

1304
01:27:03,724 --> 01:27:05,513
Hostages are coming out now.

1305
01:27:05,517 --> 01:27:07,019
McGrath plus three.

1306
01:27:07,519 --> 01:27:09,021
Everybody stay calm.

1307
01:27:19,698 --> 01:27:20,820
Mike.

1308
01:27:23,368 --> 01:27:25,120
Mike, do you have the shot?

1309
01:27:25,245 --> 01:27:28,453
Negative. I do not have a
shot. I do not have a shot.

1310
01:27:32,669 --> 01:27:35,506
- Mike, he's right there.
- I don't have it. I don't have it.

1311
01:27:42,471 --> 01:27:44,723
They stopped. Why'd they stop?

1312
01:27:58,403 --> 01:27:59,404
Shit.

1313
01:28:02,616 --> 01:28:03,992
Let's go.

1314
01:28:14,086 --> 01:28:15,792
Armando, they're
closing in on you.

1315
01:28:15,796 --> 01:28:17,627
- Do they see him?
- I don't know.

1316
01:28:17,631 --> 01:28:20,133
Mike, now. Your chance is now.

1317
01:28:20,259 --> 01:28:22,219
<i>They can see him.
They know we're here.</i>

1318
01:28:25,138 --> 01:28:26,928
I don't have it. Negative.
Negative. Negative.

1319
01:28:26,932 --> 01:28:28,976
You gotta take the fuckin' shot.

1320
01:28:49,288 --> 01:28:50,414
Armando's burnt.

1321
01:28:51,832 --> 01:28:54,205
- Shit.
- Full green. Engage.

1322
01:28:54,209 --> 01:28:56,628
Kelly, get us there. Go, go, go!

1323
01:29:19,568 --> 01:29:21,361
Contact, west dock side.

1324
01:29:30,287 --> 01:29:32,080
Dorn! Take out that sniper!

1325
01:29:32,456 --> 01:29:33,665
Sending the drone.

1326
01:29:42,883 --> 01:29:43,884
Got him.

1327
01:30:06,406 --> 01:30:08,450
Not now, Mike!

1328
01:30:08,617 --> 01:30:10,285
Not now!

1329
01:30:31,390 --> 01:30:32,808
It's okay.

1330
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,977
Not your fault.

1331
01:30:42,609 --> 01:30:45,028
Cut that bitch-ass
shit out, Mike.

1332
01:30:45,404 --> 01:30:46,901
I need Nasty Mike.

1333
01:30:46,905 --> 01:30:47,902
Nasty Mike!

1334
01:30:47,906 --> 01:30:50,784
Bad shit happens, but that
doesn't mean you're bad.

1335
01:30:51,159 --> 01:30:52,198
Do that donkey shit, a'ight?

1336
01:30:52,202 --> 01:30:54,121
That's what I'm talking about.

1337
01:30:54,329 --> 01:30:56,707
That shit right there.
That's that shit right there.

1338
01:30:56,999 --> 01:31:00,878
Bad boy. Bad boy. Bad
Boy Mike. All right?

1339

but bad meaning good</i>

1341
01:31:36,455 --> 01:31:39,095
<i>- Dorn, take out the vehicles on the four side.</i>
- Copy.

1342
01:31:46,340 --> 01:31:47,841
Go, go! Move it!

1343
01:31:48,217 --> 01:31:51,341
Sir! We're taking heavies. We lost
the trucks and three guys outside.

1344
01:31:51,345 --> 01:31:53,013
Goddamn it!

1345
01:31:53,597 --> 01:31:55,637
Set firing positions,
both sides. Let 'em in.

1346
01:31:55,641 --> 01:31:56,558
Go.

1347
01:31:57,684 --> 01:32:01,559
<i>Marshal Howard, heat signature at the site

Dorn, we need cover and we

1350
01:32:10,030 --> 01:32:11,240
Here comes the smoke.

<i>I got your six.</i>

1352

01:32:34,888 --> 01:32:37,470
- Get those drones down now!
- Go!

1354
01:32:37,474 --> 01:32:38,680
Move, move, move!

1355

Eyes up!

Oh, shit!

1357
01:32:46,984 --> 01:32:50,195
It's like redneck
Jurassic Park in here.

Let's get out of here, now.

It's just Dukey, baby.

1386
01:36:25,202 --> 01:36:27,659
Marcus, my gun. I dropped my gun
in the water. It's by your foot.

I don't need no gun, Mike.

Begone, gator.

This is not your place, Duke.

See, Mike?

{\an8}Go, go.

That motherfucker racist,
Mike. That motherfucker racist!

01:37:20,132 --> 01:37:21,425
Mike sent me.

1397
01:37:21,717 --> 01:37:22,885
I need you to trust me.

1398
01:37:48,076 --> 01:37:49,077
Run.

Stop!

Go! I'll slow you down.

Okay. Hey.

1413
01:40:27,319 --> 01:40:29,234
Fan out. Take the
team upstairs.

1414
01:40:32,241 --> 01:40:33,659
No targets.

1415
01:40:38,872 --> 01:40:40,374
Go topside!

1416
01:40:52,678 --> 01:40:54,471
Okay. Okay, here.

1417
01:40:54,763 --> 01:40:56,344
- Put me down. It's okay.
- Okay.

1418
01:40:56,348 --> 01:40:58,559
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1419
01:40:59,852 --> 01:41:00,936
Hey.

1420
01:41:04,189 --> 01:41:05,482
Thank you.

1421
01:41:27,045 --> 01:41:28,668
I've been here before.

1422
01:41:31,383 --> 01:41:32,839
Oh, shit.

1423
01:41:56,366 --> 01:41:57,822
How did you let him catch you?

1424
01:41:57,826 --> 01:41:59,657
He's sneaky as hell, Mike.

1425
01:41:59,661 --> 01:42:01,580
Your wife and I were
having a debate.

1426
01:42:01,955 --> 01:42:04,833
She seems to have an
inflated impression of you.

1427
01:42:04,958 --> 01:42:07,211
- Mike.
- Hey, bae.

1428
01:42:07,586 --> 01:42:09,880
Nevertheless, this is
the end of the road.

1429
01:42:10,506 --> 01:42:12,174
One of them is about to die.

1430
01:42:12,674 --> 01:42:14,301
You choose.

1431
01:42:18,472 --> 01:42:20,682
What you don't
know, Mr. McGrath...

1432
01:42:21,308 --> 01:42:23,310
is one of 'em can't die.

1433
01:42:25,312 --> 01:42:26,976
Who you talking 'bout?

1434
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:29,900
A wise man told me I was gonna
have to make a hard choice.

1435
01:42:30,526 --> 01:42:34,359
You need to check with that motherfucker
before you out here choosing shit.

1436
01:42:34,363 --> 01:42:36,569
You have five
seconds, Mr. Lowrey.

1437
01:42:36,573 --> 01:42:38,242
We gonna need some
more time, sir.

1438
01:42:38,367 --> 01:42:40,698
Four... three...

1439
01:42:40,702 --> 01:42:42,992
Mike. Don't you do no dumb shit.

1440
01:42:42,996 --> 01:42:44,081
...two...

1441
01:43:00,764 --> 01:43:03,267
- Mike. Mike.
- Hey. Hey. I'm here.

1442
01:43:05,227 --> 01:43:06,975
Motherfucker done shot me.

1443
01:43:06,979 --> 01:43:08,230
Aw, damn.

1444
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:11,896
- Here. Let me check it. Let me see.
- No, Mike. Your donkey ass shot me again.

1445
01:43:11,900 --> 01:43:15,567
- Let me look at it.
- Don't touch me with your donkey hooves, Mike.

1446
01:43:15,571 --> 01:43:16,860
Damn, man.

1447
01:43:16,864 --> 01:43:18,862
Listen. I had to
fucking take the shot.

1448
01:43:18,866 --> 01:43:19,988
No, Mike. No.

1449
01:43:19,992 --> 01:43:22,198
Marcus. Let me take a look.

1450
01:43:22,202 --> 01:43:23,741
You see that shit, Christine?

1451
01:43:23,745 --> 01:43:27,203
- I shot you in your vest. Stop bitchin'.
- It don't matter. Okay?

1452
01:43:27,207 --> 01:43:29,873
You see what you done devoted
your life to, Christine?

1453
01:43:29,877 --> 01:43:31,791
<i>I've got eyes on
Aretas. Moving in.</i>

1454
01:43:31,795 --> 01:43:33,505
Shit. That's Judy.

1455
01:43:34,173 --> 01:43:35,795
Armando, do you copy?

1456
01:43:35,799 --> 01:43:37,159
<i>Armando, do you copy?</i>

1457
01:43:39,887 --> 01:43:40,721
Oh, shit.

1458
01:43:41,054 --> 01:43:43,303
Mom. Mom, don't.

1459
01:43:43,307 --> 01:43:44,929
Get away from her.

1460
01:43:44,933 --> 01:43:46,727
- Mom.
- Now!

1461
01:43:47,561 --> 01:43:49,142
Mom, listen to me,
you don't understand.

1462
01:43:49,146 --> 01:43:51,064
Callie, I need you
to listen to me.

1463
01:43:51,190 --> 01:43:54,480
I want you to step slowly to
your right and walk towards me.

1464
01:43:54,484 --> 01:43:56,278
Mom. Mom, I'm fine, okay?

1465
01:43:56,653 --> 01:44:00,365
Callie, I need you to
move out of the way.

1466
01:44:00,991 --> 01:44:02,030
Mom.

1467
01:44:02,034 --> 01:44:05,325
Mom, don't shoot, don't
shoot! Mom, he saved me. Stop!

1468
01:44:05,329 --> 01:44:06,534
Judy! Judy!

1469
01:44:06,538 --> 01:44:09,791
Back off, Mike!
Put the gun down.

1470
01:44:11,668 --> 01:44:13,045
He saved my life.

1471
01:44:18,175 --> 01:44:19,176
Please, Mom.

1472
01:44:38,570 --> 01:44:40,572
Mom. Mom.

1473
01:44:41,365 --> 01:44:43,279
Are you hit? Are you hit?

1474
01:44:43,283 --> 01:44:44,493
I'm good.

1475
01:44:45,369 --> 01:44:46,703
You good?

1476
01:44:51,875 --> 01:44:53,998
You did good. You did good.

1477
01:44:54,002 --> 01:44:55,796
<i>Howard. Where are you?</i>

1478
01:45:00,008 --> 01:45:01,677
<i>Howard. Do you copy?</i>

1479
01:45:04,555 --> 01:45:06,390
<i>Howard, what's your location?</i>

1480
01:45:10,727 --> 01:45:11,812
Go.

1481
01:45:13,730 --> 01:45:15,107
Before I change my mind.

1482
01:45:16,942 --> 01:45:18,735
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

1483
01:45:25,826 --> 01:45:28,408
Hey. You good? You good?

1484
01:45:28,412 --> 01:45:29,742
Hey.

1485
01:45:29,746 --> 01:45:30,914
Take this.

1486
01:45:31,331 --> 01:45:33,162
Head south. Don't look back.

1487
01:45:33,166 --> 01:45:34,080
Hey.

1488
01:45:34,084 --> 01:45:35,377
I got it.

1489
01:45:35,627 --> 01:45:36,962
Be good.

1490
01:45:37,504 --> 01:45:39,131
It's not up to you, detective.

1491
01:46:23,634 --> 01:46:25,465
Come on, come on. We
got injured cops here.

1492
01:46:25,469 --> 01:46:28,468
I need you to bring
the writ to me now.

1493
01:46:28,472 --> 01:46:29,677
I know, I know, I know.

1494
01:46:29,681 --> 01:46:31,554
- How is he?
- You know, he'll pull through.

1495
01:46:31,558 --> 01:46:32,851
Ow!

1496
01:46:38,732 --> 01:46:40,442
Don't kiss him, Christine.

1497
01:46:41,276 --> 01:46:44,901
Mike, in our next life, you
coming back as a pair of my shoes.

1498
01:46:44,905 --> 01:46:46,694
And I ain't gonna wear no socks.

1499
01:46:46,698 --> 01:46:48,909
And I'mma step in
all kind of shit.

1500
01:46:49,284 --> 01:46:51,366
<i>Miami DA and mayoral
candidate Adam Lockwood</i>

1501

<i>and former Army
Ranger James McGrath</i>

<i>were killed this
morning in a firefight.</i>

1503
01:46:55,624 --> 01:46:57,789
<i>It is believed that Lockwood
and McGrath were the key links</i>

1504
01:46:57,793 --> 01:46:59,791
<i>between Miami law
enforcement and cartels.</i>

1505

<i>The late Captain Howard

1506

<i>Co-conspirators are currently being
rounded up by the FBI and the Miami PD.</i>

<i>The search for convicted killer
Armando Aretas continues.</i>

<i>The fugitive remains at large.</i>

1509
01:47:21,733 --> 01:47:23,314
Hey, hey, hey. My people.

1510
01:47:23,318 --> 01:47:25,863
- Where's Theresa?
- She's with Little Marcus by the swings.

1511
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:27,680
Hey. I'm about you
hook you all up.

1512
01:47:28,073 --> 01:47:29,279
- I'm about you hook you up.
- Please. We're starving.

1513
01:47:29,283 --> 01:47:30,617
Watch this.

1514
01:47:31,869 --> 01:47:33,161
Partner.

1515
01:47:34,454 --> 01:47:36,081
What's all this?

1516
01:47:37,583 --> 01:47:38,705
Why you got on an apron?

1517
01:47:38,709 --> 01:47:40,460
Work on my grill skills.

1518
01:47:40,752 --> 01:47:42,750
No, Mike, you gotta
earn the grill.

1519
01:47:42,754 --> 01:47:47,718
This takes seasonings and temperatures.
You can't just be cooking on my grill.

1520
01:47:48,051 --> 01:47:51,013
Your grill? Joker,
this is a public park.

1521
01:47:51,180 --> 01:47:52,886
You don't own every
grill you see.

1522
01:47:52,890 --> 01:47:57,477
You know what, Mike? Why don't you go
make some potato salad and set the table?

1523
01:47:57,853 --> 01:47:59,434
Oh, you talking dirty.

1524
01:47:59,438 --> 01:48:01,732
Now, look. I don't... I don't
know what you got going on

1525
01:48:01,899 --> 01:48:05,523
with your barbeque dictatorship
in your mind, but I ain't the one.

1526
01:48:05,527 --> 01:48:07,817
I'm cooking on this grill
whether you like it or not.

1527
01:48:07,821 --> 01:48:09,740
- Hey, Mike...
- Excuse me, sirs.

1528
01:48:11,408 --> 01:48:13,202
What are you... What
you doin', Reggie?

1529
01:48:13,327 --> 01:48:15,329
Request permission
to cook my chicken.

1530
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,748
Permission denied, Reggie.
Go ahead somewhere, man.

1531
01:48:21,752 --> 01:48:23,552
Take your smock off and
go play with the kids.

1532
01:48:23,962 --> 01:48:27,257
Listen, this is the man
area of the barbeque.

1533
01:48:27,424 --> 01:48:28,634
Look, you know what?

1534
01:48:28,967 --> 01:48:32,717
All due respect, we appreciate that
you did save people that we love.

1535
01:48:32,721 --> 01:48:34,302
- We appreciate that, right?
- Yeah, we appreciate that.

1536
01:48:34,306 --> 01:48:36,391
- We appreciate that from here, Reggie.
- Yeah.

1537
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:39,353
- Now, back the fuck up.
- Yeah.

1538
01:48:39,603 --> 01:48:41,643
All right, look. I'm willing
to compromise with you.

1539
01:48:41,730 --> 01:48:44,812
You can work that half of the grill.
It's small. And I'll work this half.

1540
01:48:44,816 --> 01:48:46,610
Is he still standing there?

1541
01:48:49,071 --> 01:48:50,235
Yes, he is.

1542
01:48:50,239 --> 01:48:51,448
Huh, that's weird.

1543
01:48:51,740 --> 01:48:52,616
Yeah.

1544
01:48:53,325 --> 01:48:55,244
He think he hard now.

1545
01:48:56,745 --> 01:49:01,204
You need to let that motherfucker know he
ain't cooking no chicken out here today.

1546
01:49:01,208 --> 01:49:05,295
Mike. He killed 15
people at the house.

1547
01:49:05,879 --> 01:49:07,752
So, you not gonna
handle this shit?

1548
01:49:07,756 --> 01:49:11,093
Yeah, I'm gonna let that
motherfucker cook the chicken.

1549
01:49:15,055 --> 01:49:18,513
Yeah, there's something weird in his
eyes. So I'mma make the potato salad.

1550
01:49:18,517 --> 01:49:20,139
- I'mma set the table.
- Yeah.

1551
01:49:20,143 --> 01:49:21,770
Permission granted,
Reggie. There you go.

1552
01:55:28,470 --> 01:55:30,806
Come on. Bring your ass on.

1553
01:55:31,014 --> 01:55:32,971
It's too hot out
here for this shit.

1554
01:55:32,975 --> 01:55:36,645
Wish I had a horse. At least I
could ride that motherfucker.

1555
01:55:36,854 --> 01:55:40,899
All this free air out here, and
I still smell your stinkin' ass.

1556
01:55:43,986 --> 01:55:45,237
I curse you, donkey.

1557
01:55:45,445 --> 01:55:48,115
I curse you for all lifetimes.

1558
01:55:48,240 --> 01:55:49,571
Oh!

1559
01:55:49,575 --> 01:55:50,905
You mother...

1560
01:55:50,909 --> 01:55:52,744
Fuck you, Marcus.
