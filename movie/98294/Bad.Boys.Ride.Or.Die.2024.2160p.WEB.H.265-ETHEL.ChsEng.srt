慢点好吗 迈克?你搞得我不舒服
Hey, slow down, Mike, okay? You're making me sick.

3
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,890
如果不是你害我们迟到 我会慢点的
I would slow down if you hadn't already made us late.

4
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,680
我们没迟到好吗?是你太紧张
We're... We're not late, okay? You're just anxious.

5
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,100
不 我紧张是因为你害我们迟到
No, I'm anxious 'cause you made us late.

6
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,400
我下半生一定不会和你一起这样做
I'm not doin' this with you in the next phase of our lives.

7
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,650
你必须尊重我的时间
You're gon' respect my time.

8

我的肚子
My stomach. My stomach.

9
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,240
迈克 马上在那家店前停车
Hey, Mike, look, pull over at that store right there.

10
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,580
我需要姜汁汽水
I need a ginger ale.

11
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,620
我们没时间买姜汁汽水 老兄
Look, we don't have no time to get no ginger ale, man.

12
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,460
别这样 迈克 我不舒服
Come on, Mike, I'm sick.

13

昨天才摆出来的
I put 'em on yesterday.

29
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,700
打开收银机
Hey, open the register.

30
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,490
不 马上!

31
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,490
先生 你选错日子了
Sir, today is not the day.

Look, if I'm not in that car in 15 seconds,

34
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,630
有个脾气暴躁的男人会进来 我们都完蛋了
there's a very surly man that's comin' in here and we both are fucked.

35
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,210
马克斯 别动
Marcus. Hey, don't fuckin' move.

36

过去!
The fuck over there!

37
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,680
迈克 我跟这人说了我必须走了
'Ey, Mike, I told this guy I had to go.

38
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,510
柜台上那是彩虹糖吗 马克斯?
Is that Skittles on the counter, Marcus?

39
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,390
他花了很久时间卖我姜汁汽水
Well, he was takin' a long time with the ginger ale.

40
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,680
不对 他进来时就马上拿了姜汁汽水
That is incorrect. He grabbed that ginger ale the second he came in here.

41
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,850
是热狗吗 马克斯?
A hot dog, Marcus?

42
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,230
你根本不该吃那鬼东西
You're not supposed to be eatin' that shit.

43
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,270
这不是我的 迈克 是你的
This is not mine, Mike. Yes, it is.

44
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,820
你别多管闲事
Mind your business with your tattletaling ass.

大家都闭嘴!
Everybody shut the fuck up!

46
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,660
先生 你必须把武器放下
Sir, I'm gonna need you to lower your weapon.

47
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,780
不然你来拿我的武器吧
Come take my weapon, then, motherfucker.

48
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,490
别跟他作对
Don't antagonise him.

49
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,740
马克斯 上车
Marcus, get in the car.

50
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,160
迈克 他拿枪指着我的头
Mike, he has a gun to my head.

51
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,830
你想对付他 还是我?
Wanna deal with him, you wanna deal with me?

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,590
抱歉 先生 我必须走了
Sorry, sir, but I gotta go.

53
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,680
你不必向他开枪 迈克
You didn't have to shoot him, Mike.

54
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,270
上车
Get in the car.

55
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,270
打911
Call 911.

56
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:34,850
你们不是警察?
Aren't you the police?

57
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,690
绝地战警: 生死与共

58
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,530
别人眼里的你
Other people look at you

59
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,240
看到的是量身定制的西装 汽车 手表
and see the tailored suits, the cars, the watches.

60
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,330
我们相识时 那一切都不存在
I met you without any of that.

61
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,330
一丝不挂 基本上是赤身裸体
Stripped, basically naked...

62
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,710
那是90%我嫁给你的原因
which is 90% of why I'm marrying you.

63
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,260
我在你最低谷时遇见了你
I met you at your lowest.

64
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,300
你中了枪
You'd been shot.

65
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,350
但你内心的火
But there was a fire in you that was...

66
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,180
是非凡的
...extraordinary.

67
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,900
我发誓要用余生来煽动那股火焰
And I vow to spend the rest of my life fanning that flame.

68
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,820
现在我宣布

73
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,800
他在中枪后与治疗师结婚是有道理的
You know, it kinda makes sense that he married his therapist after he got shot.

74

我喜欢他一点 心理健康非常重要
I love that for him. Mental health is super important.

75

说早了就不灵了 我仍然只是个卑微的美国律师
Oh, not yet. Don't jinx it. I'm still just a lowly US Attorney.

Can I get you anything? No, I'm good, thank you.

85

一直以来 我都以为你至死都是单身汉
And all this time, I thought you were a terminal bachelor.

86
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,500
这一次我自己也始料不及
I... I... I even surprised myself with this one.

87
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,800
我想你一直没遇见对的人
Yeah, I guess you just hadn't met the right one.

88
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,970
那时候我还有待成长
I had some growing up to do.

89
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,430
当时你已经50岁了
You were 50.

90
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,010

00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,730
我处于海洋的底部
I was in the basement of the ocean.

141
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,020
我所有的烦恼都消失了
All my bullshit was gone.

142
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,810
唯有自由
Just freedom.

143
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,150
还有完全充满爱 迈克
And full body love, Mike. Full body love.

144
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,320
好
Okay.

145
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,700
不如你
Why... Why... Why don't you...

146
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,820
以爱让你全身从边缘回来好吗?
...love your full body back from the ledge, please?

147
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,280
没什么好怕的
Nothing to be scared of.

148
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,370
我的时间还没到 宝贝
It's not my time, baby. It's not my time.

149
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,540
伯内特先生!
Mr Burnett!

150
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,290
我看着他
Hey, I got him.

151
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,920
他只是
He's just...

152
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,010
我不知道他到底在干嘛
I don't know what the fuck he's doing.

153
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,890
但我看着他了 我们没事
But I got it. I got him. We're good. We are good.

154
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,390
我们很好!
We are great! 'Ey...

155
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,430
迈阿密!
Miami!

156
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,930
305一辈子!
305 for life!

157
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,060
唰唰!
Kakow!

158
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:14,150
停 你那东西会闪瞎别人的眼睛
All right. Just stop. You gon' put somebody's eye out with that thing, man.

159
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,360
我在唤醒我的原始能量 迈克
I'm bringing the thunder, Mike. I get it.

160
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,440
唤醒能量
Bringing the thunder.

161
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,360
好 就是这样
All right. There you go.

162
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,070
来抱抱
Oh, man. Bring it in.

163
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,990
我以为我已经失去你了 兄弟
Thought I lost you, brother.

164
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,240
你的人生少不了我
Couldn't lose me if you tried.

165
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,000
你知道你的屁股露出了吧?
You know your ass is out, right?

166
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,500
大家的屁股都露出来了 迈克
Everybody's ass is out, Mike.

167
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,080
嘿
Hey.

168
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,960
一场暴风雨要来了
There's a storm coming.

169
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,590
不 不是那种暴风雨
No. Not that kind of storm.

170
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,090
你会经受考验
You're gonna be tested.

171
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,180
事情会变得糟糕
Things are gonna get bad,

172
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,970
你将不得不做出一个非常艰难的选择
and you're gonna have to make a really hard choice.

173
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,190
你只需记住 你很厉害
Just know you're good.

174
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,460
这是我的私人时间 麦格拉斯先生
This is my private time, Mr McGrath.

175
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,920
请问有什么能帮到你的吗?
How may I help you?

176
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,930
我要你转一些钱 你的钱?
I need you to move some money. Your money?

177
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,720

Your boss's, actually. I need it to be cartel cash.

178
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,640
不到两千万
Just under 20 million.

179
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,690
回溯那账户从2004年到2020年1月的
Backdated series of transfers beginning 2004, ending January 2020...

180
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,560
一系列
into...

181
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,940
转账
...that account.

182
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,980
以已故康拉德霍华德警监的名义
In the name of the late Captain Conrad Howard.

183
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,150
我有负责物流的人
I have people who can handle logistics.

184
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,870
我只需要你的登录信息
I really just need your log-in credentials.

185
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,120
我为什么要给你这些?
And why would I give you those?

186
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:51,990
天啊!
Oh, my God!

187
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,130
过来 亲爱的
Come here, darling.

188
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,960
来
Come on.

189
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,550
过来
Come here.

190
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:09,800
面部识别

191
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,060
手机无法转账
You can't transfer funds from a phone.

192
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,320
亲爱的 怎么了?
Hey, honey, what's going on?

193
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,190
她们互相认识吗?
Do they know each other?

194
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,570
亲爱的 谁在你身边?
Honey, who's there with you?

195
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,200
好!亲爱的?
All right, all right! Honey--

196
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,130
转账开始了
Here we go.

197
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,420
资金转移

198
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,710
转至:康拉德霍华德

199
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,710
他们会为此杀了你
They'll kill you for this.

200
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,550
他们不会知道事情的经过
They're not even gonna know this happened.

201
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:53,470
你的女友听见你和你太太的电话
Your girlfriend heard you on the phone with your wife

202
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,350
发现你根本没打算和她离婚
and realised you were never gonna divorce her.

203
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:59,140
她一怒之下开枪射杀了你
And in a fit of passion, she shot you.

204
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,820
你的保镖试图介入 但已经来不及了
Your bodyguard tried to step in, but he was too late.

205
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,950
当她意识到她那恐怖的行为
And realising the horror of her actions...

206
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,160
她自杀了
she took her own life.

207
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,240
不要!
No!

208
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,880
亲爱的 你在干什么?
Honey, what are you doing?

209
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,380
两星期前你才心脏病发作 没错
You had a heart attack two weeks ago. Exactly.

210
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:32,680
他们称其为寡妇制造者是有原因的 你该留在医院 宝贝
They call it a widow-maker for a reason. You need to be in the hospital, baby.

211
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,890
我尝试说过他了
Hey, I tried to told his ass, T.

212
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,980
显然 他已经是成年人了 他获准自行出院
Apparently, he's an adult. He was allowed to sign hisself out.

213
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,810
宝贝 别这样 我一刻也无法忍受离开你
Hey, babe. Look, come on. I couldn't take one more second away from you.

214
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:47,190
我体内的支架让我血脉喷张
All these stents in me got my blood flowing.

215
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:50,110
我在回家途中 好吧
I'm on D way. All right, now.

216
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,950
拜托 那是我的电话
Ey. Ey. Come on, man. That's my phone.

217
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,450
我爱你 马克斯 我们10分钟后到
I love you, Marcus. We'll be there in 10.

218
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,540
好的 宝贝 爱你
All right, babe. All right. Love you.

219
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,330
嘿 迈克
Hey, Mike.

220
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,210
我没打算告诉你
I wasn't even gonna tell you this...

221
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,420
但我们不是第一次了
but this ain't the first time we done this.

222
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,210
我们时常同车 你是什么意思?
We ride together all the time, what you mean?

223
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,550
不 我是说我们的灵魂
No, I'm talking about our souls.

224
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,630
我们曾一起同车 但我看到了全部 迈克
You know, we've ridden together, but I saw it all, Mike.

225
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:16,010
我们注定携手同行 已经做了好几辈子的生死搭档
We're bound. And we have been for lifetimes.

226
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:20,680
我们并不总是叫迈克和马克斯 但我们的灵魂不曾改变
We haven't always been Mike and Marcus, but we've always been us.

227
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,770
你在说什么?
What you talking 'bout?

228
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:27,070
我们是灵魂伴侣
We're soulmates.

229
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:29,990
是 是的
Yup. Yeah.

230
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:31,780
不
Naw.

231
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:36,330
我认为的灵魂伴侣看起来有点不同
Yeah, I kind of... I saw my soulmate looking a little different than that.

232
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,580
迈克 你被困在肉体里
See... See, Mike, you stuck in the physical.

233
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,540
灵魂没有鸡鸡
Souls don't have dicks.

234
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,660
我蛮肯定我的灵魂有鸡鸡 马克斯
I'm pretty sure my soul has a dick, Marcus.

235
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,090
看吧?就是这些废话 所以我们才被困住
See? That's that shit right there. That's why we're stuck.

236
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,380
我本来也没打算告诉你这个
You know, I wasn't gonna tell you this shit either,

237
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,680
但我的灵魂比你的先进多了
but my soul is more advanced than your soul.

238
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:58,260
我不是说你的灵魂很笨
It's not that your soul is stupid.

239
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,390
知道吗?
You know?

240
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:04,310
只是你比较像是婴儿灵魂 知道吗?
It's just that you're more like a baby soul. You know?

241
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,810
而我比较像是母亲的灵魂
And I'm more like a mother soul.

242
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,730
我只想给你喂奶
And I just gotta suckle ya.

243
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,780
知道吗?让你吸奶
You know? Put you on that titty.

244
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,400
知道吗?
You know?

245
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,910
你觉得你的大脑缺氧多久了?
Hey. How long you think your brain went without oxygen?

246
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,040
爸爸!爸爸回来了
Daddy! Daddy's home.

247
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,040
宝贝!宝贝 你回来了 我的家人呢?我的家庭
Baby! Oh, baby, you're back. Where my family? My family.

248
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,420
嗨 宝贝
Hey, baby.

249
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,550
小马克斯!
Little Marcus!

250
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:36,720
跟奶奶和爷爷说嗨
Say hi to Pop-pop. Say hi to Grandad.

251
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,720
我非常想念!你看你 女人
I missed you so-Look at you, woman.

252
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,720
不 别这样 看着我 宝贝
No, come on, look at me, baby.

253
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:49,230
我们得让他们冷静下来
We're gonna have to hose them down.

254
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,940
好 我们知道了
All right. All right, we get it. We get it.

255
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,530
放点冰在你的内裤什么的
Put some ice in your drawers or somethin'.

256
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,360
真好笑
That's funny.

257
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,780
你感觉好吗 马克斯?
Are you feeling good, Marcus?

258
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,700
我一生中从未感觉如此好过
I never felt better in my life.

259
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,250
马克斯 我太想你了 亲爱的 但你必须休息
Oh, Marcus, I missed you so much, honey, but you need to get some rest.

260
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,750
不 宝贝 我需要你
Oh, no, baby, I need you.

261
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,880
让我去补充一些电解质 好的 宝贝 给我一个吻
Just let me get some electrolytes. Okay, baby. Give me a kiss.

262
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,180
我爸爸怎么了?
So, what's going on with my dad?

263
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,930
他赤裸地站在屋顶上
Well, he was on the roof naked...

264
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,980
他还说他去了海床
and he said he had been at the basement of the ocean.

265
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,810
"神奇鹰嘴豆"?
"Amazing Chickpeas"?

266
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,810
还有 他说我有个很笨的婴孩灵魂
Oh, and he said I have a stupid baby soul

267
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,610
也没有鸡鸡
with no penis.

268
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,360
你们必须和他谈谈

269
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,360
嘿 雷吉 是 长官
Hey, Reggie. Yes, sir.

270
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,030
你吃了我的零食?没有 长官
Did you eat my snacks? No, sir.

271
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,490
我正期待着我的零食 雷吉
I was looking forward to my snacks, Reggie.

272
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,040
亲爱的
Honey.

273
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,750
你知道吗?你该去找份工作
You know what? You need to get a job.

274
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,540
我是一名美国海军陆战队员 长官
I'm a US Marine, sir.

275
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,130
那么你该被调派出去
Well, then you need to deploy.

276
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,880
我们刚从也门回来

你以为我死了 对吗?死了?

279
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,140
有一件事你不知道 雷吉
One thing you don't know, Reggie.

280

不能有压力 吵闹声 消耗体力
No stress, no loud noises, no physical exertion.

284
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,070

290

我留了沙拉给你
I have a salad for you.

292
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,170
沙拉?!
A salad?

293
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:43,550
特丽莎 看来一切在你掌控之中 我的任务也完成了
Hey, T, looks like you got this under control. My tour of duty is done.

I'll give you $1,000 for some Skittles.

299
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,110
马克斯 我不会买糖给你
Marcus, I am not buying your ass no candy, man.

300
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:04,910

Okay, $2,000, Mike, for some Ding Dongs. And that's my final offer.

301
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:07,740
你别想有叮当了
I think you're gonna be Ding Dong-less...

302
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,330
就如我的灵魂一样
like my soul.

303
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,280
你总是带走我爱的人

我是迈克·劳瑞警探

305
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,040
警监倒下了
The Captain is down.

306
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,620
他是我儿子

307
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,960
你的家庭一团糟 迈克
You got a fucked up family, Mike.

308
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:21,400
突发新闻 司法部一直对迈阿密警察局的贪污问题进行调查
The Department of Justice has been investigating the corruption in the Miami Police Department.

309
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,950
现在我们拥有可靠的情报
And we now have credible intelligence

310
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,320
当年是康拉德霍华德警监指挥这些人员
that Captain Conrad Howard was directing these elements

311
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,490
与贩毒集团协调
in coordination with the cartels.

312
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,460
不 我没兴趣 大概的时间
No, I'm not interested in approximately what time.

313
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,630
我只要知道确实 时间 明白吗?
I need to know exactly what time, do you understand?

314
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,880
你一直知道这件事?
You knew about this?

315
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,340
我两个星期前才知道
I found out two weeks ago.

316
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,930
记者会 真的吗?
A press conference. Really?

317
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,220
我很遗憾你们通过这种方式得知
I'm sorry about the way you had to find out.

318
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,930
但考虑到你们的密切关系 我们的密切关系?
But given your closeness-Our closeness?

319
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:53,560
如果没有霍华德警监 你们谁也没有工作
Neither one of y'all would have a job if it wasn't for Captain Howard.

320
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,390
丽塔 你知道事情不是这样的
Rita, you know this is not true.

321
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,440
坦白说 我不知道
Honestly, I don't.

322
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,570
调查发现了新的证据
The investigation has turned up new evidence.

323
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,780
迈阿密执法部门多年来出了不少岔子
Miami law enforcement's been a leaky ship for years now.

324
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,110
证人死亡 线人失踪
Witnesses turn up dead, informants disappear.

325
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,160
事件看起来是随机的 直到你汇总几年内发生的事
Events appear random until you aggregate them over a period of years.

326
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,160
然后就会看见一种模式
Then a pattern emerges.

327
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,750
他是谁?
Who is this?

328
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:19,460
巴德格莱斯 联邦调查局局长 此次调查组的领导
Bud Grice, FBI, heading up the JTF on this show.

这就是我
That's who I am.

330
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:24,010
我们知道有人在提供情报
Now, we knew someone was providing intelligence

331
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,510
给运毒品到南佛罗里达州的毒贩
to a cartel moving product into South Florida.

332
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,260
我们只是不知道是谁
We just didn't know who.

333
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:32,390
两周前 一名毒品集团的银行家被女友枪杀身亡
A cartel banker turned up dead two weeks ago, shot by his girlfriend.

334
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,810
他们找到一部手机 上面有霍华德的联系方式
They found a phone with Howard's contact on it.

335
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:39,190
与毒贩多年的沟通 还有海外银行账户信息
Years of communication with the cartel, account references offshore.

336
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,020
在霍华德的名下有数百万美元
Millions in Howard's name.

337
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,320
通过这些证据 终于可以给那贪腐的混蛋定罪了
Final piece we needed to nail that dirty motherfucker.

338
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,990
格莱斯!噢 哇 听我说
Grice! Oh, whoa. Hey, hey, let me holler at you.

339
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,620
你知道他倒下时我就在他身边 对吗?
You know I was with him when he went down, right?

340
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,040
你再说他贪腐试试
Call him dirty one more time.

341
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:54,910
你有种就说
I dare you.

342
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,290
我们知道还有其他人和他一伙 我们也会找到他们
We know he had others who were with him. We're gonna find them too.

343
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,380
和他一伙的人是我
I was with him.

344
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,550
现在就给我上手铐 我当时和他在一起 迈克
Put the cuffs on me right now. I was with him. Mike.

345
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:08,050
不 这些混蛋认为他死了 无法替自己辩护
No, these motherfuckers think that just 'cause he's dead and can't defend hisself,

346
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:11,260
就把所有问题推到他身上 毁了他的传奇
they gon' dump all this shit on him, burn his legacy.

347
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,930
有我在就不行
Not on my watch.

348
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:20,350
我是朱迪霍华德 美国法警
This is Judy Howard, US Marshals.

349
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,690
我知道我在这里没有管辖权
I realise I have no jurisdiction here.

350
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:24,360
但出于职业礼貌
But as a professional courtesy,

351
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,450
我想申请了解针对我父亲的指控的来源
I'd like to request visibility into the sources of the allegations against my father.

352
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,740
朱迪

353
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,450
我们会解决这问题的 好吗?
We're gonna figure this shit out, all right?

354
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,540
凯莉还好吗?
How's Callie?

355
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,330
你觉得呢 迈克?
How do you think, Mike?

356
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,870
我们都在同一条船 朱迪
We're on the same team here, Judy.

357
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,750
当然不是 迈克
Like hell we are, Mike.

358
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:45,590
如果不是你的混蛋儿子 我爸爸应该还活着
My dad would still be alive if it weren't for your bastard son.

359
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,670
朱迪
Judy...

360
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:49,380
如果我在街上见到他 我以我父亲发誓
If I ever catch him out on the street, I swear on my father

361
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,430
我会杀了他
I will put him down.

362
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,350
我们走吧
Come on. Come on, man. Come on.

363
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,730
迈阿密警局

364
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,640
接下来该怎么办?
So, what's our next move?

365
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,310
他们说他和毒贩合作 我们去问毒贩吧
They said he was working with the cartel. Let's ask the cartel.

366
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,610
联邦监狱 佛罗里达州中部

367
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,870
你好吗?
How you doin'?

368
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,910
这里是监狱
It's prison.

369
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,290

Yeah.

370
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,880
听好 我们需要你的帮忙
Look. We need your help.

371
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,710
他们说霍华德警监贪污
They're saying that Captain Howard was dirty.

372
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,420
你是否有情报?
Do you know anything about that?

373
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:32,050
这个情报能让我减刑多少?我还在争取
How much time I get off for this one? I'm still working on that.

374
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:35,640
我在告诉你 我需要你的帮忙
This is me telling you that I need you.

375
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:41,020
我需要知道霍华德警监是否与贩毒集团合作
I need to know if Captain Howard was working with the cartels.

376
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:45,690
没有
No.

377
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,400
他正在调查那些有合作的人
He was onto the ones that were.

378
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,030
所以他被追杀
So he got greenlit.

379
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,200
等等 不
Wait, no.

380
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,410
不 霍华德警监被杀是因为他在你母亲的暗杀名单上
No, Captain Howard was killed because he was on your mother's hit list.

381
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,410
他是被加上去的
He was added to it.

382
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,250
你们的人希望看起来像我们做的一样
Your people wanted it to look like us.

383
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:05,500
你们希望他死去
Your people wanted him dead.

384
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,840
你说"我们的人"是什么意思?
Whatchu mean, "our people"?

385
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,510
你应该小心
You should be careful.

386
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,970
你在玩游戏 但你连规则都不知道
You're playing a game and you don't even know the rules.

387
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:16,140
你那边有卑鄙的玩家 你乱说
There's dirty players on your side. That's bullshit.

388
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,300

Wait, who?

389
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,600

00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,650
我不知道他的名字
I don't know his name.

393
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,240
我母亲
My mother.

394
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,450
她就是与他对接的人
She's the one who dealt with him.

395
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,450
我就知道我们该让那巫女活着
I knew we should have kept that damn witch alive.

396
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:39,620

May she rest in peace.

398
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,160

嘿 老板
Hey, boss.

400
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:52,800
迈阿密市警察局

00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,430
我们的线人在联合特遣部队档案中 拿到了霍华德的所有记录
Our man on the inside got all of Howard's records in the JTF file.

402
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:58,180
电脑 手机 文件 一切所有
Computers, phones, files, all of it.

403
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,600
我们知道霍华德曾调查我们的行动
Well, we know Howard was onto our operation.

404
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,140
我们只是不知道他查到多少 别错过任何线索
We just don't know how much he had. We need to make sure we got every trace.

405
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,520
很好
That's beautiful.

406
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,810

两个手机没问题 他办公室电脑是空的
Two phones had nothing. His office computer was empty.

409
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,190
他很小心 但是?
He was careful. But?

410
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,410
但他的旧个人笔记本电脑加密程度较弱
But his old personal laptop had weak encryption.

411

有了
Here we go.

412
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,120
网络故障

413
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,210
你说“我们”是什么意思?
Shit. We tripped a fail-safe.

414
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:27,330
你是"我们"是什么意思?

某些东西被发送了
Something was sent.

416
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,130
给谁?
To who?

417
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,670
短信[已发送] 现在正在追踪电话
Tracing the phone now.

418
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,260
霍华德警监

419
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,560
搞什么?
What the hell?

420
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,640
他正在从另一世界给我们发短信

我大概已经死了
I'm probably dead.

424
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,570
该死!
Fuck!

425
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,160
我真倒霉
Fuck me.

426
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,030
在我开始之前
Before I begin...

427
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,530
我想说一件事:
I wanna say one thing:

428
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:05,160
我正让你陷入致命的危险
I'm putting you in mortal danger.

429

各位
Boys...

430
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,460
我们组织内有内奸
we got rats in our walls.

431
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:13,460
但我必须确保你们是我的坏孩子
But I gotta make sure you're my bad boys.

432
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,550
可乐瓶巨人就是关键
The Coke-bottle giant is the key.

433
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,340
什么?
What?

434
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,010
别相信任何人
Don't trust anybody.

435
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,390
那是什么?什么意思?"可乐瓶巨人"
What's that? What does that mean? "The Coke-bottle giant."

436
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,020
弗莱彻
Fletcher.

437
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,900
完了
Oh, shit.

438
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,440
就是他们
These are the guys.

439
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,080
我们应该向这些混蛋开一枪 一次性解决它
We should put a bullet in these motherfuckers. Be done with it once and for all.

440
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,000
林茨 我爱你 任由你处置他们是最好的了
Lintz, I love you. I'd like nothing more than to let you loose on them.

441
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,580
但更多死去的警察对我们没有任何好处
But extra dead cops doesn't do us any favours here.

442
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,630
持续监视他们 看看他们是否有所行动
Keep them under constant surveillance and see if they make a move.

443
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,590
弗莱彻的仓库就在那条巷子
Fletcher's warehouse is right down that alley.

444
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,800
迈克 我没打算告诉你这件事

445
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,680
那就别告诉我
Then don't tell me.

446
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,810
不 你一定要听 这很重要
No, you gotta hear this. This is big.

447
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,100
我死不了
I can't die.

448
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:11,850
什么?
What?

00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,940
我死不了
I cannot die.

450
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:17,990
几周前你在我的婚礼上死得还不错
Motherfucker, you did a pretty good job of dying at my wedding a couple weeks ago.

451
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,610
但我没死
But I didn't.

452
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,820

相信自己 相信宇宙
Trust yourself. Trust the universe.

468
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,990
你够了 马克斯
Stop that shit, Marcus.

469
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:09,120
我的时间还没到 迈克
It's not my time, Mike.

470
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,540
好 你是说如果我对你的脸开枪
Oh, okay. So you're saying that if I shoot you in your face,

你是说你不会死
you're saying that you won't die.

命运注定你不会朝我脸上开枪
Fate dictates that you won't shoot me in the face.

that if I shoot you in your face, are you saying you won't die?

命运不做假设 迈克
Fate doesn't deal in hypotheticals, Mike.

476
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,140
我要报警了
I'm gonna call the police.

477

You know that... Fletcher.

486
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,180

谢谢你
Thank you.

488
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,430

他不相信你们这笨蛋会解决 所以他联络了我
He didn't trust that you dumb fucks would figure it out, so he contacted me.

506

552
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,620
一个线报 我们收到线报称弗莱彻违反了假释规定
A tip. We got a tip that Fletcher had violated his parole.

553
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,580
所以我们来这里
So we came down here

554
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:09,830
显然他陷入了一些与他无关的事
and obviously he was into some shit he ain't have no business.

555
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:11,080
是真的吗 马克斯?
Is that true, Marcus?

556
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,510
你知道我一直和迈克一起
Well, you know I was with Mike.

557
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:23,010
在所有人中 你怎么会认为霍华德警监做不法之事
How could you, of all people, think Captain Howard was dirty.

558
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,680
我不希望这是真的
I don't want this to be true.

559
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,520
但做好自己的事 遵循证据对大家都有好处
But it would benefit all of us to do our jobs and follow the evidence.

560
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:33,060
你认为他蠢到把账户记在自己名下
And you think he was stupid enough to put accounts in his own name.

561
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,690
他是被陷害的 被谁?
He's being framed. By who?

562
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:37,530
这就是我们想要找出的答案
That's what we're trying to find out.

563
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,280
丽塔 拜托 你不会那么傻
Rita, come on, you're smarter than this.

564
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,070
迈克 请别忘记你正和你的上司说话
Michael, please do not forget you're talking to your boss.

565
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,830
我在努力保护你
I'm trying to protect you here.

566
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:47,870
我们没有两个街区半径的录像
I got no footage for a two-block radius.

567
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:49,080
什么?
What?

568
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,210
他们肯定毁了所有闭路电视和安保摄像头
They must've killed all CCTV, all security cams.

569
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,290
我什么也找不到
I got nothing.

570
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:56,170
至少他们没拍摄到你的恐慌发作
At least they ain't film your panic attack.

571
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,760
各位
Hey, guys.

572
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,010
你恐慌发作了吗?没有
You had a panic attack? No.

573
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:06,100
你要的话 我能推荐一位好的辅导员 不用 东恩 谢谢
If you want, I can recommend a good counsellor. I'm good, Dorn. Thanks.

574
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,970
看 这是我拍的 一帧一帧看
Look, I shot this, went frame by frame.

575
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:11,350
看这个
Check it out.

576
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,310
好 不在这里
All right. Not here.

577
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,610
东恩 关了它 好
Dorn, shut it down. Yeah.

578
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:16,980
我们走
Hey. Let's go.

579
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:21,360
这是什么?
So, what is this?

580
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,740
我们不肯定
We're not exactly sure.

581
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:25,700
哇 哇
Whoa. Wow.

582
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,160
这就对了
There you go. There you go.

583
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:31,290
好 现在我知道是你们
All right, you fucks. Now that I know it's you...

584
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:33,210
是这样的:
here it is:

585
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:39,130
我不知道最高涉及到哪个高层 但我们这边有贪官
I don't know how high up it goes, but there's corrupt officials on our side.

586
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,840
而且他们和贩毒团合作
And they're working with the cartel.

587
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,010
大约九年前 这一切开始变得很奇怪
This all started smelling funny about nine years ago.

588
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:46,800
我们准备突袭的那批毒品失踪了
That shipment of coke we were about to raid went missing.

589
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,430
上头一直阻挡我
You know, I kept getting shut down from above.

590
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:53,640
所以我找了已退休的桑切斯和鲁伊斯
So I pulled Sanchez and Ruiz outta retirement.

591
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,270
我让他们从旁调查
I had 'em working on the outside, you know?

592
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:58,940
一周后 他们在一场车祸中丧生
They were killed in a car crash a week later.

593
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,650
这让我很震惊
That shook me up.

594
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:03,360
所以我从未让你们俩插手
And it's why I never brought you two in.

595
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:07,240
你们原本可以救我 我却担心你们的安全 真丢脸
Well, shame on me for worrying about your asses when you coulda saved mine.

596
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,490
但现在由你们决定
But now it's up to you.

597
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,620
还记得2003年的逮捕行动吗?
Remember the bust back in 2003?

598
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:16,080
142公斤摇头丸?
314 pounds of ecstasy?

599
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:20,090
我收在储存柜 没有记录在案
Well, I held onto the storage unit, off the books.

600
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,960
那就是真正的文件所在的地方
That's where the real files are.

601
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,680
消灭这些混蛋所需的一切
Everything you need to exterminate these rat fucks.

602
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,800
都在里面!
It's in there!

603
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,390
你们必须完成我无法做到的事
You're gonna have to finish what I couldn't.

604
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,810
拜托你们
Please.

605
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,390
拜托了 两位
Please, boys.

606
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:33,480
你们是我最后的希望
You're my last hope.

607
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,560
2003年
2003.

608
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:42,320
那是海地人 佐伊庞德
That was the Haitians. Zoe Pound.

609
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:46,910
他们的储物柜在哪里?
Where was their storage locker?

610
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,620
我不知道
I have no idea.

611
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:52,870
好 你们该去警察局调出我们的案卷原件档案
All right. We need you guys to go down to the station and pull our original case files.

612
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,410
我们就能找出储物柜在哪里
That'll tell us where the locker is.

613
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:58,130
低调并小心地做 我们不知道谁可以信任
Do it quietly and be careful. We don't know who we can trust.

614
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:00,130
这可是大件事
Shit, this is heavy, man.

615
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,130
我有些很重要的事要说
I just got something important to say.

616
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:05,050
我就直接说吧 澄清一下
I'm just gonna come out with it. Clear the air.

617
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,970
那个内奸不是我
The rat is not me.

618
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,510
谢谢你 东恩
Thanks for that, Dorn.

619
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,730
我觉得安全多了
I feel safer.

620
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:23,110
高度设防监狱活动操场

621
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,530
他们刚打算杀了我儿子
They just tried to kill my son.

622
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:58,870
因为阿曼多可以证明霍华德警监是无辜的
Because Armando can prove that Captain Howard was innocent.

623
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:01,040
警监去世前正在调查这些受贿的警官
Cap was onto these dirty players.

624
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,500
阿曼多告诉你的?
Armando told you that?

625
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,420
是的 这就是他们想杀死霍华德警监的原因
Yes. It's the reason they wanted Captain Howard dead.

626
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:08,130
阿曼多可以认出下令袭击警监的人
Armando can ID the guy that ordered the hit on Cap.

627
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,210
有名字吗?
He have a name?

628
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:12,510
没有 但知道对方长什么样
No. But a face.

629
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:16,100
我知道你们可以做到 好吗?
Listen, I know y'all can do this. All right?

630
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:20,980
转移阿曼多 带他去迈阿密 一个安全的地方
Just transfer Armando. Get him to Miami. Get him to a secure location.

631
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:24,650
我们审问他 拿到他的证词 给他一些照片
We'll debrief him. We'll get his testimony. We'll get some pictures in front of him.

632
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,650
但请马上去做
But please do it now.

633
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:30,240
这些人试图掩饰事实 而且他们不会停手
These guys are tryin' to cover their asses and they are not gonna stop.

634
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,950
这是为了霍华德警监
Do it for Captain Howard.

635
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:40,160
对霍华德警监不利的证据确凿无疑
Look, the evidence against Captain Howard is overwhelming.

636
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,620
如果我这样做 都是为了你
If I'm doing this, I'm doing it for you.

637
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:48,300
好 我们转移阿瑞塔斯吧
All right, let's transfer Aretas.

638
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:52,340
你陪他 把他带到迈阿密的冰屋 审问他
You'll accompany him, get him to igloo here in Miami, do a debrief.

639
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:55,180
但我是因为相信你 才会冒这么大风险
But I'm sticking my neck out and I'm trusting you.

640
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:58,890
如果他是骗人的 那我就完了
If he turns out to be bullshit, then it's gonna be my ass.

641
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:02,480
所以别把我害了 迈克
So don't screw me, Mike.

642
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,570
谢谢你
Thank you.

643
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,320
谢谢你
Thank you.

644
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:13,700
什么事?
Yeah?

645
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,860
我们找到了佐伊庞德的储物柜
We found Zoe Pound's storage unit.

646
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,700
我们去拿文件 然后收藏在我的船屋
We'll go get the files then take them to my houseboat for safekeeping.

647
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,080
好 继续 找到后告诉我
All right, stay on it. Let me know when you got it.

648
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,180
请交出你的枪支 枪械将于着陆后还给你
Please surrender your firearms. They will be returned to you upon touchdown.

649
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,870
你还好吗?
You good?

650
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,280
非常好
Never been better.

651
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,990
大约需要45分钟
It's about 45 minutes.

652
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,880
迈克 我没打算告诉你
Mike, I wasn't even gonna tell you this...

653
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,710
但在我们在一起的前世之一
but in one of our previous lifetimes together...

654
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,630
你曾是一只驴
you were a donkey.

655
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,140
而且我是你的主人
And I owned you.

656
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:21,390
你很固执 迈克
You were a stubborn ass, Mike.

657
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,970
你过去常咬人和吐口水
You used to bite and spit.

658
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:25,640
你很坏
You were nasty.

659
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:30,560
但我不是好主人 因为我总会打你
But I was a terrible owner, you know, because I used to beat you.

660
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,440
因为你不听话
Because you wouldn't listen for shit.

661
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:36,860
也许我打得让你感到羞耻 迈克
And maybe I beat some kind of shame into you, Mike.

662
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:40,490
现在我意识到我伤害了你的灵魂
And now I realise I was scarring your soul.

663
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,660
你错过了午睡?
You miss your nap?

664
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:46,620
迈克 我在尝试向你道歉
Mike, I'm trying to apologise to you.

665
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:49,960
你的小被子不在这里 但你可以闭眼休息
We don't have your blankie, but you could just rest your eyes.

666
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,790
你当驴子时就是这样 好吧
That's exactly how you was as a donkey. Mm-kay.

667
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:54,920
就是那副鬼样子 我明白了
That's that shit there. I get it.

668
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,720
你需要我帮忙系安全带吗?
You need some help with your seat belt?

669
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,300
不用 驴子
No, Donkey.

670
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:04,220
嘿 布莱恩特 我是布朗森
Hey. Bryant, this is Bronson.

671
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,600
其他人之后还要回去
Other guys are on turnaround.

672
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,890
坐好
Take a seat.

673
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,120
怎么了?
What's up?

674
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:49,850
自动驾驶仪
Read the lines.

675
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:52,900
读出来 "美国法警724航班 我们有紧急情况
"US Marshal flight 724, we have an emergency.

676
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:57,570
我们的囚犯在迈阿密警察劳瑞和伯内特的帮助下越狱了
Our prisoner has escaped custody with the aid of Miami PD Lowrey and Burnett.

677
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:58,740
这里有倒下的警员
There are officers down.

678
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,490
求救 他们冲着驾驶舱来了
Mayday, mayday. They are coming for the cockpit.

679
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:04,370
我重复 他们正在劫持CH-47
I repeat, they are hijacking the CH-47.

680
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:06,580
请所有地面单位回应"
All ground units please respond."

681
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:21,630
把劳瑞的枪给我 收到
Give me Lowrey's gun. Copy.

682
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,100
快走!
Go, go!

683
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,310
去找劳瑞
Get Lowrey.

684
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:40,150
我们走!
Let's go!

685
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,560
我们不惧暴风雨 王八
We welcome the storm, motherfu--!

686
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:53,730
把我从这该死的牢笼里救出来!
Get me out of this fucking cage!

687
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:55,940
马克斯!
Marcus!

688
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:58,560
迈克!
Mike!

689
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:18,630
太重了!
It's too heavy!

690
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:20,040
别放手!
Don't let go!

691
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:02,090
抓住驾驶杆!
Grab the stick!

692
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,590
你怎么会开飞机?
Where the hell you learn how to fly?!

693
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,590
我是个毒贩 向右!
I'm a drug dealer, man. To the right!

694
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:56,520
他用了我的枪
He was using my gun.

695
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:59,020
他们究竟是怎么登上美国法警直升机的?
How the hell did they get on a federal transport?

696
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,520
我们必须分头行动
We need to split up.

697
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,310
我们要在一起
We're gonna stay together.

698
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:04,690
谁说的?
Says who?

699
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:08,110
我不是在问你
I'm not asking you.

700
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:10,240
我在告诉你 我们要在一起
I'm telling you. We're stayin' together.

701
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,610
别挡我的路
Fuck outta my way.

702
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:14,120
嘿 哪里 放开我
Hey. Where--? Get the fuck off me.

703
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,700
喂!
Hey! Hey!

704
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:16,790
听好
Look.

705
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:21,460
你是唯一能指证幕后主使的人!
You are the only person who can identify whoever is doing this!

706
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:26,550
我们活下去的唯一方法 就是先抓住他们
The only way that any of us stays alive is if we get them before they get us.

707
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:29,260
根本没有我们!
There's no us! There is no us!

708
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:30,760
该死
Damn.

709
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,840
劳瑞的基因还真是让人头大
That Lowrey DNA is a bitch.

710
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,760
你俩的劲儿都这么大
Y'all some strong motherfuckers.

711
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:40,520
好 这样吧 大家放松 我数到三
Okay. Now, look, everybody unflex. On three.

712
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,440
一!二!
One! Two!

713
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:44,350
就是这样
There you go.

714
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:50,650
霍华德警监给我们留下了文件 这些文件会告诉我们是谁干的
Captain Howard left us files that's gonna tell us who's doin' this.

715
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,780
都在东恩那里
Dorn has 'em.

716
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:54,660
我们只需要回到迈阿密
We just have to get back to Miami.

717
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:58,490
你最好别拖慢我
You better not slow me down.

718
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,910
丢了你们的电话
Lose your phones.

719
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:04,120
你跟紧我 否则我就让你自生自灭
You keep up with me or I leave you in the dirt.

720
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,540
现在你已来到我的世界
You're in my world now.

721
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:22,640
迈克 我们必须想一想
Hey, Mike. Look, we gotta think about this.

722
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:26,940
我知道你要跟他走 因为他是你的"儿子"
I know you wanna move with him, you know, because he's your "son".

723
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,780
哇 别那样说
Whoa, whoa. Don't air quote that.

724
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:33,030
不 我没有 我只是说我知道你在尝试保护他
No, I didn't. I'm just sayin' I know why you tryin' to protect him.

725
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,240
因为他是"家人"
'Cause he "family".

726
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:39,240
你这样做和刚刚没什么差
Hey. Movin' the air quotes down to your hips doesn't un-air-quote them.

727
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,290
就直说他是我儿子吧
Just say he's my son.

728
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:43,330
他是你儿子 不
He's your son. No, no.

729
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:47,580
手掌向上就像你试图说噢 他其实不是我儿子
Palms up is like you tryin' to say, oh, he's not really my son.

730
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:51,630
噢 你儿子走掉了
Oh. Well, your son's gettin' away.

731
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:52,920
混蛋
Shit.

732
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,850
如果你的人在执行某任务 最好通知我们
If your men are on some kind of op, you might wanna pull us in.

733
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:06,520
不然 这对他们来说不太好
Otherwise, it doesn't look good for them.

734
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:10,070
朱迪
Judy.

735
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:13,070
尸体的身份都确认了?对 但有三人下落不明
You ID the bodies? Roger. We got three unaccounted for.

736
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,200
劳瑞 伯内特和阿雷塔斯
Lowrey, Burnett and Aretas.

737
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,780
这些混蛋 该死
Motherfuckers. Fucking--!

738
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:19,950
见鬼
Shit.

739
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,490
好 听好了!
All right. Listen up!

740
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:25,960
我们有三名嫌疑人 他们都携带武器 而且很危险
We have three suspects, armed and dangerous, out there.

741
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,420
给我把他们抓回来
And I want them back.

742
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,250
我们走!
Let's go!

743
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:32,710
等等 朱迪
Hold on. Judy.

744
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:34,590
三个 嫌疑人?
Three suspects?

745
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:36,340
你觉得这里发生什么事?
What do you think is happening here?

746
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:38,930
你觉得呢?
What do you think?

747
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:41,510
播放音频
Play the audio.

748
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:45,480
美国法警724航班 我们有紧急情况
US Marshal flight 724, we have an emergency.

749
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:49,310
我们的囚犯在迈阿密警察劳瑞和伯内特的帮助下越狱了
Our prisoner has escaped custody with the aid of Miami PD Lowrey and Burnett.

750
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:51,520
有警官倒下 求救
There are officers down. Mayday, mayday.

751
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:55,530
不是吧 你不会相信迈克和马克斯会这样做
Come on, you can't possibly believe Mike and Marcus would do this.

752
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:59,450
你自己说的 劳瑞一心想让儿子出狱
Nah, you said it. Lowrey was obsessed with getting his son out of prison.

753
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:01,120
别急 朱迪
Slow down, Judy.

754
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,540
这里不是迈阿密 塞卡达
This isn't Miami, Secada.

755
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:07,210
这些都是我的逃犯 现在全世界都是我的管辖范围
These are my fugitives and right now the whole world is my jurisdiction.

756
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:09,710
你们认识了一辈子 你怎么能这么说?
You've known them your whole life. How can you even suggest--?

757
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:12,340
我认为这是迈克和马克斯策划的吗?
Do I think that Mike and Marcus planned this?

758
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,420
也许不是
Probably not.

759
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:17,130
但当涉及到家人时 人们会做他们通常不会做的事
But people do things they wouldn't normally do when family's involved.

760
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:19,590
根据我的经验 无辜的人不会逃跑
In my experience innocent men don't run.

761
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:23,260
我们能不能先分析 你能不能做好自己的工作?
Can we stop and think before-Are you capable of doing your job?

762
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:24,770
因为我必须继续调查
'Cause I need to move on.

763
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,520
他们还活着
They survived.

764
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:33,570
什么意思?
What the fuck you mean, they survived?

765
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:37,150
现场没有尸体 美国法警将其视为搜捕行动
No bodies on site. US Marshals are treating it as a manhunt.

766
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:41,320
这些人就是死不了
These guys just refuse to die.

767
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,280
他们是通缉犯
They're wanted men.

768
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,870
执法部门和媒体现在是我们的朋友
Law enforcement and media are our friends now.

769
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:49,580
三名逃犯的追捕行动
A manhunt for three fugitives

770
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:51,580
在南佛罗里达州引起了轩然大波
is sending shock waves across South Florida.

771
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:54,290
弹道报告与从尸体中找到的子弹相符
Ballistic reports have matched the bullets recovered from the bodies...

772
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:57,970
鉴于最近发生的事件 您打算退出市长竞选吗?
Are you planning on dropping out of the mayor's race in light of the recent events?

773
00:52:57,970 --> 00:52:59,800
目前搜捕工作正在进行中
The manhunt is currently underway.

774
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:04,050
联邦调查局正在协助美国法警逮捕这些人
The FBI is assisting US Marshals in bringing these men in.

775
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:09,890
劳瑞 伯内特和阿雷塔斯应被视为有武器且危险
Lowrey, Burnett and Aretas should be considered armed and dangerous.

776
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:14,310
这些人杀害了其他专业执法人员
These are individuals who have killed fellow law enforcement professionals.

777
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:17,530
如果你看到什么 请说出来
If you see something, say something.

778
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:19,950
在道上悬赏
Put a bounty on the streets.

779
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,620
通知城里的每一个帮派 让他们为之而战
Get it to every gang in the city and let them fight for it.

780
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:28,370
五百万
Five mil.

781
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:31,290
我们去把这些混蛋抓起来
Let's go get these motherfuckers.

782
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,510
宇宙太疯狂了 不是吗?
The universe is crazy, ain't it?

783
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:44,640
看我们
Look at us.

784
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:49,140
今早起床时没人料到我们会走到这一步吧
I bet none of us thought when we woke up today this is where we'd be.

785
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:51,730
你离开了监狱
You outta jail.

786
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:53,600
我俩要进监狱了
We goin' to jail.

787
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,270
命运真幽默
This shit is special.

788
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:57,980
迈克?
Mike?

789
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:01,740
你有什么想对阿曼多说的吗?
Is there anything you would like to say to Armando?

790
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,320
你怎么那样说呢?没有
Fuck you talkin' to me like that? No.

791
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:07,120
迈克 就是现在 向你儿子说出来
Mike, this is a moment. Express with your son.

792
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:17,540
对不起
I'm sorry.

793
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:20,760
这样就对了嘛
That's what I'm talking about.

794
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,300
为了什么?为了一切
For what? For everything, man.

795
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:27,350
看来我爱的人都遭遇坏事 所以
Seems like bad shit happens to anybody I love, so...

796
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:30,100
我开始想也许我被诅咒了
Startin' to think maybe I'm cursed.

797
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,390
我只是觉得
I just feel like...

798
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:33,890
也许是我连累了你
maybe I cursed you.

799
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:37,610
你没有
You ain't fuckin' cursed me.

800
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:40,030
大家都会遇上不好的事
Bad shit happens to everybody.

801
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,650
从来都不是你一个人的事
Ain't always about you.

802
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:44,910
阿曼多
Hey, Armando.

803
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:49,450
不知我是否跟你说过 但几个星期前我死了
I don't know if I told you this, but I died a couple of weeks ago.

804
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,040
很遗憾听到这个消息
Sorry to hear about that.

805
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,920
噢 不 是我经历过的最好的事情
Oh, no. The best thing that ever happened to me.

806
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,330
那次经历太不可思议
Shit's wild.

807
00:54:56,330 --> 00:54:57,840
但你们?
But y'all?

808
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,500
你们就是我活过来的理由
Y'all the reason I came back.

809
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,670
嘿
Hey.

810
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:04,880
大家 抱一个
Everybody, bring it in.

811
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,720
来 抱一个 来吧
Come on, bring it in. Come on.

812
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:09,760
什么?
What?

813
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:11,850
这就对了 阿曼多
There you go, Armando.

814
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:14,100
这就对了 这就
There you go. There you--

815
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:16,650
你俩这逃犯当得太不合格了
Y'all are some terrible fuckin' fugitives.

816
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:21,940
你以为自己是马克斯温弗瑞吗?
So, what are you, fuckin' Marcus Winfrey?

817
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:23,530
什么?看吧?
What? Now, see?

818
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:26,200
你让我们看起来很软弱 好像不知如何逃跑
You makin' us look soft, like we don't know how to be on the run.

819
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:38,670
第二修正案才是美国自己的国土安全部

820
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:41,090
最好先给你找一身别的衣服穿
Better get you out of this.

821

1112

1126
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:28,210

好了 进去吧
All right, come on.

1128
01:14:33,390 --> 01:14:35,100
迈克 你看到吗?

1129
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:36,760
接电话
Pick up the phone.

1130
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:40,180
哇 迈克!
Whoa, Mike! Mike! Mike!

1131
01:14:46,270 --> 01:14:47,270
等一下
One second.

1132
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:53,200
凯莉
Callie.

1133
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:55,660
我在电视上看到 我妈妈正在追捕迈克叔叔
I saw it on TV. My mom is after Uncle Mike.

1134
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:58,660
他不可能做了他们所说的一切
There is no way that he did everything that they're saying.

1135
01:14:58,660 --> 01:14:59,870
亲爱的
Sweetheart.

1136
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:04,120
一切会好起来的
Everything is going to be okay.

1137
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:06,710
知道吗?
Okay? Okay?

1138
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:20,310
喂?是我 离开房子
Hello? It's me. Get out of the house.

1139
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:24,020
凯莉和我一起 带她走!马上离开!
I've got Callie with me. Take her and go! Get out now!

1140
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:27,940
凯莉 到我后面去
Callie, get behind me.

1141
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:30,730
迈克
Mike.

1142
01:15:36,410 --> 01:15:37,700
克莉斯丁!
Christine!

1143
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:48,670
劳瑞先生
Mr Lowrey.

1144
01:15:50,210 --> 01:15:51,590
我在跟谁说话?
Who am I speaking to?

1145
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:54,420
我想你知道我是谁
I think you know who you're speaking to.

1146
01:15:55,090 --> 01:15:56,430
我要你儿子
I need your boy...

1147
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:01,060
以及你敬爱的警监所藏匿的所有证据
and whatever evidence your beloved captain had squirrelled away.

1148
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:04,690
用这些交换你的妻子
And for that, you can have your wife.

1149
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:07,100
稍后我会回电教你怎么做
I'll call you back with instructions.

1150
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:10,110
混蛋
Aw, shit.

1151
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:13,440
该死的
Goddamn it.

1152
01:16:14,490 --> 01:16:15,490
我会去
I'll go.

1153
01:16:21,290 --> 01:16:22,830
让我的生命有价值一些
Let my life be worth something.

1154
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:26,460
绝对不行
Never.

1155
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:30,340
绝对不行
Never.

1156
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:39,430
迈克
Mike.

1157
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:42,180
他已经知道了
He knew.

1158
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:43,640
什么意思?
What do you mean?

1159
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:46,560
他已经知道我们会来
He knew we were comin' in.

1160
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,940
他已知道我们有霍华德警监的档案
He knew we had Captain Howard's files.

1161
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,570
他知道我们认出他
He knew we had ID'd him.

1162
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:53,070
他怎么会知道?
How?

1163
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:55,940
唯一与你交谈过的人是丽塔
Only person you spoke to was Rita.

1164
01:16:57,110 --> 01:16:58,410
不是丽塔
It's not Rita.

1165
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:03,580
她对男人的品味也太差了
Damn, she got bad taste in men.

1166
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,530
未知来电

1167
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:07,710
司法部一直在调查迈阿密警察局的腐败问题
Justice has been investigating the corruption in the Miami Police Department...

1168
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:10,420
有报告称已故警监康拉德·霍华德
...with reports suggesting the late Captain Conrad Howard...

1169
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:11,630
喂?
Hello?

1170
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:14,050
指挥着这些人员与毒贩协调
...was directing these elements in coordination with the cartels.

1171
01:17:14,050 --> 01:17:16,920
对霍华德的指控 间接针对劳瑞和伯内特
Allegations against Howard, which allude to include Lowrey and Burnett,

1172
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:22,180
包括帮助毒贩将毒品运到佛罗里达州
and the operation range from helping cartels move the product into the state of Florida

1173
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:25,020
以及交出关键证人 销毁证据
as well as giving up key witnesses, destruction of evidence,

1174
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:26,850
甚至谋杀同事
and even the murder of fellow officers.

1175
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:29,310
发生什么事?我不知道
What's going on? I don't know.

1176
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:33,900
案件有了突破 我必须去警局
There's been a breakthrough in the case. I need to get down to the station.

1177
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:37,110
我要到那里去
I'm gonna head down there.

1178
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:41,740
我跟你去
I'm coming with you.

1179
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:56,760
你在发短信给谁?
Who are you texting?

1180
01:17:57,670 --> 01:18:01,800
我需要和办公室联系
Just... Just gotta get in touch with the office.

1181
01:18:02,890 --> 01:18:04,180
联合部队
JTF.

1182
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:06,140
必须通知大家
Gotta let everybody know.

1183
01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:15,650
亲爱的 别这样
Hey. Honey. Come on.

1184
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:18,070
亲爱的 你在干什么?停手
Honey, what are you doing? Stop that.

1185
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:19,860
你在干什么?停手
What are you doing? Stop it.

1186
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:21,660
放开我 你在干什么?
Let go of me. What are you doing?

1187
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:23,280
还给我!
Give it back to me. Give it back!

1188
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:56,650
见鬼
Fuck!

1189
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:58,900
来
Hey, hey, come on.

1190
01:19:01,490 --> 01:19:02,570
你还好吗?
You okay?

1191
01:19:02,570 --> 01:19:03,990
看手机
Look at the phone.

1192
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,630
你知道你完蛋了 对吧?
You know you done fucked up, right?

1193
01:19:22,130 --> 01:19:23,380
你没事吧?
You all right?

1194
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:28,890
对不起
I'm sorry.

1195
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:32,390
没什么好抱歉的
Ain't got nothing to be sorry for.

1196
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:57,210
我们会找到她的 警监
We'll find her, boss.

1197
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:05,430
除了在场的人 我不相信任何人
I don't trust anybody that's not standing right here, right now.

1198
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:08,800
我们每多牵扯进来一个人
Every extra person that we involve

1199
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:11,890
都会增加他们知道我们要来的可能性
increases the likelihood that they know we're coming,

1200
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:16,560
这增加了克莉斯丁和凯莉
which increases the likelihood that Christine and Callie

1201
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,400
无法逃生的可能性
don't make it out of there.

1202
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:23,740
这意味着不要特警 法警和后援
That means no SWAT, no marshals, no backup.

1203
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:26,700
只有我们
It's just us.

1204
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:34,000
我从来没想过事情会这样发展
I never meant for it to go this way.

1205
01:20:34,790 --> 01:20:36,460
你认为事情会如何发展?
How did you mean it to go?

1206
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:40,960
9/11之后 没有人关心毒品进入这个国家
After 9/11, nobody cared about drugs coming into this country.

1207
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:44,170
为了确保边境安全 我们开始与毒贩合作
So to secure the borders we started to work with the cartels.

1208
01:20:44,170 --> 01:20:48,010
他们随时警告我们任何即将发生的恐怖活动
And they kept us informed about any terrorist activity coming our way.

1209
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:51,510
效果很好 从那以后我们就没有再受到袭击
And it worked. We haven't had an attack since.

1210
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:53,810
我们正在保护这个国家
We were protecting this country.

1211
01:20:53,810 --> 01:20:58,350
你杀害警察并通过将毒品带入这个国家而致富
You were killing cops and getting rich putting drugs into this country.

1212
01:20:58,350 --> 01:21:00,730
丽塔 所以你才杀了霍华德
Rita. That's why you killed Howard.

1213
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:03,110
他盯上你 你要掩饰你的罪行
He was onto you. You wanted to cover your tracks.

1214
01:21:03,110 --> 01:21:05,400
不 是麦格拉思
No. That was McGrath.

1215
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:07,610
他失控了
He's out of control.

1216
01:21:07,610 --> 01:21:10,120
丽塔 先听我的
Rita. Just take a second.

1217
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:13,200
我无意让这一切发展到这个地步
I never meant for any of this to go this way.

1218
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:26,550
我想我只想知道你是否是真心的
I guess I just need to know if it was ever real.

1219
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:29,010
我一直都是真心的
It was always real.

1220
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:32,470
我慌了 失控了
I panicked. I lost control.

1221
01:21:33,140 --> 01:21:34,770
你是否爱过我?
Did you love me?

1222
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:36,060
是的
Yes.

1223
01:21:36,730 --> 01:21:38,140
我发誓
I swear.

1224
01:21:38,850 --> 01:21:40,440
那表示
Well, that means...

1225
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:41,610
很好 声音样本采集完成
We good. We got it.

1226
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:43,650
99%声音匹配
99% voice match.

1227
01:21:45,070 --> 01:21:49,360
我完全不在乎 你这废物
...absolutely nothing to me, you piece of shit.

1228
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:57,750
是我
Hey. It's me.

1229
01:21:58,370 --> 01:22:00,330
到底发生什么事?
What the hell's going on?

1230
01:22:00,330 --> 01:22:02,080
你搞砸了 就是这回事
You screwed up is what's going on.

1231
01:22:02,210 --> 01:22:06,050
我们暴露了 到了那里我会解释
We've been compromised. I'll explain when I get there.

1232
01:22:06,050 --> 01:22:09,420
我们要转移人质 古巴 长期禁锢
We're moving the hostages. Cuba. Long-term hold...

1233
01:22:10,090 --> 01:22:14,300
这样在我们解决这个问题时 劳瑞 伯内特和阿雷塔斯就不敢轻举妄动
to keep Lowrey, Burnett and Aretas quiet while we sort this out.

1234
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:17,600
我会带来水上飞机 天一亮我就会到
I'm bringing a seaplane. I'll be there at first light.

1235
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:24,440
好 把这个地方收拾起来
All right, pack this place up.

1236
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:27,110
所有设备和人员准备搬迁
All equipment and personnel prepare to move.

1237
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:29,740
我们要将人质移出外国
We're moving the hostages out of the country.

1238
01:22:44,210 --> 01:22:45,710
你的手怎么了?
What happened to your hand?

1239
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:56,810
他们称之为哥伦比亚美甲
They call that a Colombian manicure.

1240
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:04,520
这酷刑的绝妙之处在于
What's so great about it

1241
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:07,070
它能让你感受最大程度的痛苦
is it's the maximum amount of pain,

1242
01:23:07,070 --> 01:23:08,190
但又不会死去
but you don't die.

1243
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:16,660
所以现在你决定成为那个拿着钳子的人
So now you've decided to be the one holding the pliers.

1244
01:23:18,370 --> 01:23:19,950
每个人都会崩溃
Everybody breaks.

1245
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,290
每个人
Everyone.

1246
01:23:22,870 --> 01:23:24,170
你丈夫
Your husband...

1247
01:23:24,790 --> 01:23:27,090
将会跪在我面前
is gonna kneel down in front of me...

1248
01:23:27,590 --> 01:23:29,510
并求我饶了你们的命
and beg for your lives.

1249
01:23:30,670 --> 01:23:33,180
然后你就会看着我杀掉他
And then you're gonna watch me kill him.

1250
01:23:36,090 --> 01:23:38,310
你不了解我丈夫
You don't know my husband.

1251
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:41,310
我们没正式认识过 但是
Well, not officially, but...

1252
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:43,980
我期待再次和他见面
I look forward to seeing him again.

1253
01:23:56,660 --> 01:23:59,580
坏孩子
Bad boys Bad boys

1254
01:24:05,330 --> 01:24:06,750
唱嘛 迈克
Come on, Mike.

1255
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,130
坏孩子
Bad boys Bad boys

1256
01:24:16,930 --> 01:24:18,510
你打算怎么做
Whatchu you gonna do

1257
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:20,180
对
Yeah.

1258
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:23,270
敌人朝你袭来时 你打算怎么做
What you gonna do When they come for you

1259
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:29,270
这就够了
That's enough, dawg. That's enough.

1260
01:24:29,270 --> 01:24:31,980
我们回头再继续唱
Okay, well, we'll circle back on that one.

1261
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:45,540
好 飞机准备好了 20分钟后开始行动
All right. The plane is ready. We roll in 20.

1262
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:48,330
这是一座废弃的游乐园 应该没有平民
It's an abandoned amusement park. There should be no civilians.

1263
01:24:48,330 --> 01:24:51,800
飞机将从南边降落 在一侧
Plane is gonna land from the south. On the one side.

1264
01:24:52,550 --> 01:24:55,050
马克斯和我将在飞机上
Marcus and I will be on the plane.

1265
01:24:55,050 --> 01:24:58,760
阿曼多会在水中奋力前行 两侧
Armando's gonna make his way in the water. The two side.

1266
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:03,220
卡丽 丽塔 这条路是一进一出
Kelly, Rita. This road is one way in, one way out.

1267
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:05,060
你守着那条路
You're holding that road.

1268
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:08,810
东恩 你控制空中
Dorn, you're gonna control the air.

1269
01:25:08,810 --> 01:25:12,570
无人机在空中 干扰已激活 通讯安全
Drones in the air, jamming is active, comms are secure.

1270
01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:15,740
他们会以为洛克伍德正乘着飞机
As far as they know, Lockwood is on his way with the plane

1271
01:25:15,740 --> 01:25:18,240
将人质转移到古巴
to move the hostages to Cuba.

1272
01:25:19,110 --> 01:25:22,490
当他们带着人质靠近飞机时 就会很快被杀死
The second they get close to the plane with the hostages, it's quick kills.

1273
01:25:22,490 --> 01:25:24,290
消除所有威胁
Neutralise all threats.

1274
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:26,830
这些混蛋杀了很多好警察
These motherfuckers killed a lot of good cops.

1275
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:29,000
他们绑架了我的妻子和凯莉
They have my wife, they have Callie.

1276
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,960
他们袭击了我们的家人
They attacked our families.

1277
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:33,090
今天我们不能输

1278
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:37,260
嘿
Hey.

1279
01:25:38,470 --> 01:25:41,010
飞机一降落 只要你搞小动作
We get on the ground, you even flinch,

1280
01:25:41,010 --> 01:25:43,180
就会在0点24秒里死去
you'll be dead in .24 seconds.

1281
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:44,600
我同意
I concur.

1282
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:48,560
我在外面的平台上有一人把风
I got one lookout on the platform outside.

1283
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:51,360
二号楼的屋顶上有一名狙击手
I got one sniper on the roof of building two.

1284
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:53,020
让我看看
Tee those up.

1285
01:25:55,820 --> 01:25:57,280
大家继续前进
Everybody keep moving.

1286
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:59,360
那些是什么?鳄鱼
What are those? Gators.

1287
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:02,070
我以为这是一个废弃的 鳄鱼公园
I thought it was an abandoned gator park.

1288
01:26:02,070 --> 01:26:03,450
被人类遗弃
Abandoned by humans.

1289
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:05,700
其实这是一个古老的游乐园
It's actually an old amusement park.

1290
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:09,120
它占地10英亩 2017 年飓风"艾尔玛"之后被废弃
It sat on 10 acres, abandoned in 2017 after Hurricane Irma.

1291
01:26:09,670 --> 01:26:14,130
他们的主要景点是一只名叫杜克的白化鳄鱼
Their main attraction was an albino alligator named Duke...

1292
01:26:14,130 --> 01:26:17,630
他长16英尺 重900磅
...who was 16 feet long, 900 pounds.

1293
01:26:17,630 --> 01:26:20,220
"传说它还在那里"
"And legend has it he's still there."

1294
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:21,890
完了
Fuck that.

1295
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:38,240
阿曼多已经在他的位置
Armando's at his QTH.

1296

人质现在出来了

迈克 他就在那边 我无法开枪
Mike, he's right there. I don't have it. I don't have it.

1303
01:27:42,380 --> 01:27:44,680
他们停下来了 为什么停下来?
They stopped. Why'd they stop?

1304
01:27:58,320 --> 01:27:59,400
糟糕

迈克 马上 现在就是你的机会

They can see him. They know we're here.

1310

我无法开枪 不行

1311
01:28:27,090 --> 01:28:29,140
你一定要开枪
You gotta take the fuckin' shot.

1312
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:50,330
阿曼多暴露了
Armando's burnt.

1313
01:28:51,540 --> 01:28:54,120
该死 全面作战 开始行动

1331
01:31:03,540 --> 01:31:06,000
不坏意味着坏 但坏就意味着好

1508
01:47:40,540 --> 01:47:42,880
不 迈克 你要努力争取烤架
No, Mike, you gotta earn the grill.

1509
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:47,840
这需要调味料和温度 你不能直接在我的烤架上做饭
This takes seasonings and temperatures. You can't just be cooking on my grill.

1510
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:50,920
你的烤架?好笑了 这是一个公共公园
Your grill? Joker, this is a public park.

1511
01:47:50,920 --> 01:47:53,010
你看到的烤架并不是你的
You don't own every grill you see.

1512
01:47:53,010 --> 01:47:57,600
不如你去做点马铃薯沙拉 摆好桌子
You know what, Mike? Why don't you go make some potato salad and set the table.

1513
01:47:57,600 --> 01:47:59,270
休想派我去做杂活
Oh, you talking dirty.

1514
01:47:59,270 --> 01:48:01,640
这样吧 我不知道你脑子想的
Now, look. I don't... I don't know what you got going on

1515
01:48:01,640 --> 01:48:05,360
烧烤独裁是怎么回事 但你小看我了
with your barbecue dictatorship in your mind, but I ain't the one.

1516
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:07,650
不管你喜不喜欢 我要在这个烤架上做饭
I'm cooking on this grill whether you like it or not.

1517
01:48:07,650 --> 01:48:09,570
迈克 抱歉 长官们

1519
01:48:13,160 --> 01:48:14,910
请求允许我煮鸡肉
Request permission to cook my chicken.

1520
01:48:19,830 --> 01:48:21,580
许可被拒绝 雷吉 去找其他地方吧 伙计
Permission denied, Reggie. Go ahead somewhere, man.

1521
01:48:21,580 --> 01:48:23,710
脱掉你的工作服 去和孩子们一起玩
Take your smock off and go play with the kids.

1522
01:48:23,710 --> 01:48:27,250
听着 这是烧烤的男士区
Listen, this is the man area of the barbecue.

1523
01:48:27,250 --> 01:48:32,550
恕我直言 我们很感激你拯救了我们所爱的人
Look, you know what? All due respect, we appreciate that you did save people that we love.

你走开 没错
Now, back the fuck up. Yeah.

1527
01:48:39,390 --> 01:48:41,480
好 这样吧 我愿意妥协
All right, look. I'm willing to compromise with you.

1528
01:48:41,480 --> 01:48:44,690
你可以用那一半的烤架 它很小 这一半我来用
You can work that half of the grill. It's small. And I'll work this half.

1529
01:48:44,690 --> 01:48:46,560
他还站在那里吗?
Is he still standing there?

1530
01:48:48,900 --> 01:48:50,070
没错
Yes, he is.

1531
01:48:50,070 --> 01:48:51,610
好奇怪
Huh, that's weird.

1532
01:48:51,610 --> 01:48:52,990
是的

你该让那混蛋知道 他今天不能在这里煮鸡肉
You need to let that motherfucker know he ain't cooking no chicken out here today.

1535
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:05,120
迈克 他在屋内杀了15个人
