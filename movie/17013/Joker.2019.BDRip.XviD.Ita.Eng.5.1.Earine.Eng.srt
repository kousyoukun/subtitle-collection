I'm Stan I. Brooks,
and here's what's happening.

00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:25,108
It's day 18
of the garbage strike,

8
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,902
with 10,000 tons of garbage
piling up every day.

9
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,029
Even the nicest sections
of the city

10
00:00:30,114 --> 00:00:31,447
are looking like slums.

[O'Rourke] There's no need to
wait until somebody dies

It's already
a serious situation.

17
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:44,354
[news anchor]
It's something that affects

18
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,498
almost everyone in the city,

19
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,672

no one avenue

[man 2] It's starting to
affect my business

24
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:56,639
because of
the garbage situation.

to smell it,

26

It don't affect me except

28
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:03,730

29
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:04,897

anything like it.

33
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:10,820
What is this world coming to?

34
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,071
[man 4] Put 'em in a room,

35
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:13,717

00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,950

Is it just me,

99

or is it getting crazier
out there?

100

- It is certainly tense.
- Hmm.

People are upset.

How about you?

Have you been keeping up
with your journal?

Yes, ma'am.

00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:24,907
Great.

109
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,368
Did you bring it with you?

Arthur.

111
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,543
Last time, I asked you
to bring your journal

112
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,294
with you for these appointments.

113
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,338
Can I see it?

114
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:54,186
I've been using it as a journal,

115
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,732
but also as a joke diary.

116
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:02,236
Funny thoughts or observations.

117
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,530
I think I told you

118
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,783
I'm pursuing a career
in stand-up comedy.

119
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,830
No, you didn't.

120
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,292
I think I did.

How does it feel to
have to come here?

124
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,284
Does it help to
have someone to talk to?

125
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,581
I think I felt better

126
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,666
when I was locked up
in the hospital.

127
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:00,961
And have you thought more about

128
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,714
why you were locked up?

Who knows?

131
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,147
I was wondering
if you could ask the doctor

132
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:22,149
to increase my medication.

133
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,491
Arthur, you're on
seven different medications.

134
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:34,411
Surely,
they must be doing something.

135
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:40,126
I just don't want to
feel so bad anymore.

Would you please
stop bothering my kid?

139
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:22,603
I wasn't bothering him.
I was...

140
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,836
Just stop.

Nothing.

And finally, tonight,

156
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,486
just when you thought
it couldn't get any worse,

157
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:55,946
authorities are saying

158
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,490
the city is under siege
by scores of rats.

159
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,950
And not just any rats,

160
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:02,161
but super rats,
who are hard to kill.

161
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,246
He must not be
getting my letters.

00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,414
Yeah.

163
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,666
It's Thomas Wayne, Mom.

He's a busy man.

165
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:13,130
Please. I worked
for that family for years.

166
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,591
The least he could do
is write back.

167
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:20,304
Here.
Don't get all worked up. Eat.

168
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:21,472
You need to eat.

169

00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:55,005
[announcer on TV] From
NCB Studios in Gotham City,

182
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:58,467
it's Live with Murray Franklin!

183
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:02,554
Tonight, Murray welcomes
Sandra Winger...

184
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:03,931
Oh, Sandra Winger's on.

185
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:07,226
And the piano stylings
of Yeldon and Chantel.

186
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,520
Joining Murray, as always,

187
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:12,272
Ellis Drane
and his jazz orchestra.

188
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,109
And now, without further ado,

189
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,028
Murray Franklin.

190
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,154
- [upbeat jazz music playing]
- [audience cheering]

191
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,267
- [music ends]
- [audience cheering loudly]

192
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,167
- Thank you.
- [Arthur cheering]

193
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,461
Thank you.

194
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,964
We got a great-looking
audience tonight.

195
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,258
Yeah!

196
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,135
Wow. Thank you. Thank you.

197
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:42,636
Thank you.

198
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,722
So, everybody's heard
about the super rats that

199
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,225
- are in Gotham now, right?
- [audience] Yeah.

200
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,687
Well, today, the mayor said
he has a solution.

201
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:53,397
You ready for this?

202
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:54,648
Super cats.

203
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,400
[all laughing]

204
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:00,798
But in all seriousness,
I mean, these rats are...

205
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,322
[Arthur] I love you, Murray!

206
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,074
[audience chuckling]

207
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,492
I love you, too.

208
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:06,827
[all laughing]

209
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,996
Hey, Bobby,
would you put the lights on?

210
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,164
Who is that?

211
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,499
Was that you?
You wanna stand up, please?

212
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,585
Stand up for me.

213
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:15,752
Go ahead.

214
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,634
What's your name?

215
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:25,179
Hi, Murray. Arthur.

216
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,014
- Arthur?
- My name's Arthur.

217
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:28,909
Oh, okay. Well, there's
something special about you,

218
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:29,975
Arthur, I could tell.

219
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,143
Where are you from?

220
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,020
I live right here in the city

221
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:35,148
- with my [stammers] mother.
- [audience laughing]

222
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,418
[Murray] Okay, hold on.
Hold on.

223
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:38,586
There's nothing funny
about that.

224
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,278
I lived with my mother before
I made it. Just me and her.

225
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:44,281
I'm that kid whose father went
out for a pack of cigarettes,

226
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:45,449
and he never came back.

227
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,575
[audience] Aww.

228
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,660
[Arthur] I know
what that's like, Murray.

229
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,371
I've been the man of the house
for as long as I can remember.

230
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,290
I take good care of my mother.

231
00:13:57,462 --> 00:14:00,380
All that sacrifice,
she must love you very much.

232
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,548
She does.

233
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:06,261
She always tells me to smile
and put on a happy face.

234
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:09,056
She says I was put here
to spread joy and laughter.

235
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,599
[audience] Aww.

236
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:13,977
Wow.

237
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:19,483
I like that. I like that
a lot. Come on down.

238
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:22,486
Come on. For that,
you gotta come down.

239
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:24,131
- [audience cheering]
- Come on! Come on.

240
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,656
[upbeat jazz music playing]

241
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,038
Come on.

242
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:43,298
[audience cheering loudly]

243
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:50,514
Okay, we got a big show
tonight. Stay tuned.

244
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,474
We'll be right back.

245
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,643
That was great, Arthur.
Thank you.

246
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,562
I mean, I loved hearing
what you had to say.

247
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,938
It made my day.

248
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,314
Thanks, Murray.

249
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,400
You see all this,
the lights, the show,

250
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:02,776
the audience, all that stuff?

251
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,171
I'd give it all up
in a heartbeat

252
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,362
to have a kid like you.

253
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,214
[stretching shoe]

254
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,059
- [indistinct chattering]
- [music playing on radio]

255
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:45,527
[sighs]

256
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,967
- [Randall] What's up, ladies?
- Hey, Randall. What's up?

257
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,658
Another day in chuckle town.

258
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:52,826
[man] Yup.

259
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,456
You okay?

260
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,918
I heard about
the beatdown you took.

261
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,754
Fucking savages.

262
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,716
It was just a bunch of kids.
I should have left it alone.

263
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,842
No.

264
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,345
They'll take everything
from you if you do that.

265
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,846
All the crazy shit out there.

266
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,098
- They're animals.
- [chuckles]

267
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:20,896
You know what?

268
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,152
Here.

269
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,072
What is it?

270
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,615
Take it.

271
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,617
It's for you.

272
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:37,996
[chuckling]

273
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:40,040
[Randall] You gotta
protect yourself out there.

274
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,292
Otherwise,
you're gonna get fucked.

275
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,087
Randall,

276
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:49,174
I'm not supposed to have a gun.

277
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,177
Don't sweat it, Art.

278
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,221
No one has to know.

279
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,723
And you can pay me back
some other time.

280
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,100
You know you're my boy.

281
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,227
[laughing]

282
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:01,311
[Gary] Arthur,

283
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,438
Hoyt wants to
see you in his office.

284
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,692
Hey, Gary. You know
what I've always wondered?

285
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,984
No idea.

286
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,986
Do you people call it
miniature golf

287
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,530
or is it just golf to you?

288
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,782
[Randall and Arthur laughing]

289
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,286
[man] Punch him in the dick,
Gary.

290
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:21,915
[laughing]

291
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:36,888
Hello, Hoyt.

292
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,558
Gary said you wanted to see me.

293
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:42,644
How's the comedy career?
Are you a famous stand-up yet?

294
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:43,770
Not quite.

295
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,064
Just been
working on my material.

296
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,150
No, don't sit.
This'll be quick.

297
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,818
Look, I like you, Arthur.

298
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,403
You know, a lot of the guys,

299
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,127
they think you're a freak,
but I like you.

300
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,657
I don't even know
why I like you.

301
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:57,951
But I got another complaint.

302
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:01,455
It's starting to piss me off.
Kenny's Music.

303
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,457
The guy said you disappeared.

304
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,000
Never even returned his sign.

305
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:07,669
Because I got jumped.

306
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,755
Didn't you hear?

307
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,673
For a sign?

308
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:14,009
That's bullshit.
It doesn't even make sense.

309
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:16,136
Just get him his sign back.

310
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,680
He's going out of business,
for God's sake, Arthur.

311
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,640
Why would I keep his sign?

312
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,560
How the fuck do I know?
Why does anybody do anything?

313
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,855
If you don't return the sign,

314
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,065
I gotta take it
out of your paycheck.

315
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,276
Are we clear?

316
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,572
Listen, I'm trying to help you.

317
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,699
Okay? And I'll tell you
something else.

318
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,242
The other guys,

319
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,167
they don't feel comfortable
around you, Arthur,

320
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,205
because people
think you're weird.

321
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,208
Okay? And I can't
have that around me.

322
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,709
[Hoyt continues indistinctly]

323
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,049
[grunting]

324
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:28,875
[elevator bell dings]

325
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:32,587
[jabbing buttons]

326
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,050
[Sophie] Wait, wait, wait.

327
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:38,218
Wait.

328
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:42,597
Thank you.

329
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:03,493
[GiGi giggles]

330
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,205
This building is so awful,
isn't it?

331
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,543
This building is so awful,
right, Mommy?

332
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,129
Yes, we can hear you, GiGi.

333
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:16,631
It's so awful, Mommy.

334
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:18,258
[imitates gunshot]

335
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,342
Right, Mommy?

336
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,223
[elevator bell dings]

337
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,810
- Good night.
- [GiGi] This building's

338
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,163
- so awful, isn't it?
- Mmm-hmm.

339
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,314
- [baby crying]
- [man shouting]

340
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,651
Hey.

341
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:39,446
[imitates gunshot]

342
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,367
Come on.

343
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,125
[upbeat music playing]

344
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,127
[door closes]

345
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:57,964
The moon is a silver dollar

346
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,051
Shining up in the sky

347
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,678
That's the dream we can buy...

348
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,083
- [Arthur] Look up.
- [Penny] Mmm.

349
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,223
Maybe the mailman's
throwing them away.

350
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,268
Mom, why are these letters
so important to you?

351
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,467
What do you think he's gonna do?

352
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:13,897
He's gonna help us.

353
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:18,985
But you worked for him,
what, 30 years ago?

354
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:21,029
Why would he help us?

355
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,782
Because Thomas Wayne
is a good man.

356
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:27,243
If he knew how we were living,

357
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:30,872
if he saw this place,
it would make him sick.

358
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,918
I can't explain it to you
any better than that.

359
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,672
I don't want you worrying
about money, Mom.

360
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,132
Or me.

361
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:42,759
Everybody's telling me

362
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,470
that my stand-up's
ready for the big clubs.

363
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:49,265
But, Happy, what makes you
think you could do that?

364
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,476
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

365
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,938
Don't you have to be funny
to be a comedian?

366
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,775
[men on TV singing]

Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom

369
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,180
The world is in a mess

370
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,558
With politics and taxes
And people grinding axes

371
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:32,809
There's no happiness

372
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:33,893
[Arthur imitates gunshot]

373
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,354
Happiness is not a riddle

374
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:39,232
When I'm listening to that
Big bass fiddle

375
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,109
[men vocalizing]

376
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,579
Slap that bass
Slap it till its dizzy

377
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:54,998
Slap that bass
Keep the rhythm busy

378
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,876
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Misery, you've got to go...

379
00:22:58,586 --> 00:22:59,836
Hey, what's your name?

380
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:02,047
Arthur.

381
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:06,301
Hey, Arthur,
you're a really good dancer.

382
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:08,136
I know.

383
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,930
You know who's not?
Him.

384
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:15,894
[increases volume]

385
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,480
[Penny] Happy, what was that?
Are you okay?

386
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,689
[Arthur] Mom, what?

387
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:21,983
[Penny] That noise!
Did you hear that noise?

388
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:24,402
I'm watching an old war movie!

389
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,071
[Penny] Turn it down!

390
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:27,572
- Um...
- [men continue singing]

391
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,120
Sorry, Mom.

392
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,206
[children chattering]

393
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:43,630

394
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:47,967
You good?

395

[audience laughing]

398
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,871
It's nice to see these couples
out at my show.

399
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:01,040
I have a wife.
We love to role-play.

400
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,835
- [audience] Ooh!
- Yes, yes, very sexy.

401
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,503
My favorite one right now is

402
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:08,631
professor and senior
who really needs

403
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,049
to pass my class to graduate.

404
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:11,134
[audience laughing]

405
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,468
- Yes.
- [audience whooping]

406
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,305
So, I'll tell you how I operate.

407
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,598
I'm a professor at

408
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,201
a prestigious
New England university...

409
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,475
[Arthur laughing]

410
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:23,605
And my wife is a senior
in my "Intro To Western Civ."

411
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,190
[audience laughing]

412
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:26,816
I know. I know.

413
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:30,153
Why is she a senior in the
intro? I didn't buy it either.

414
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,114
So, she comes to me
during my office hours.

415
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:34,199
[Arthur laughing]

416
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:35,883
It's Monday and Wednesday,
three to five.

417
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:38,244
She says,
"Excuse me, Professor Lewis."

418
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:40,330
I can't use my real last name
at this college

419
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,040
'cause they don't hire Jews.

420
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:43,791
[audience laughing]

421
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,126
It's something I'll address

422
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:46,836
once I have tenure,
but for now...

423
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,172
She says,
"Excuse me, Professor Lewis,

424
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,567
I think I might be
in danger of failing

425
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:51,799
your 'Intro to Western Civ, '

426
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,092
and I just want you to know

427
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:54,928
I'm willing to do
anything to pass."

428
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:59,140
And I said, "Anything?"
And she said... [moans]

429
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,693

- [Arthur] Oh, hey.
- Hey.

432
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,461
Were you following me today?

433
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:15,758
Yeah.

434
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,470
I thought that was you.

435
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:22,724
I was hoping you'd come in
and rob the place.

436
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,311
I have a gun.

437
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,104
I could come by tomorrow.

438

00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,026
You're so funny, Arthur.

Yeah.

441
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:39,240
You know, I do stand-up comedy.

442
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:42,160
You should maybe
come see a show sometime.

443
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,203
I could do that.

444
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,496
Yeah?

445
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,457
Yeah. You'll let me know when?

446
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:48,624
Yeah.

Arthur, I need to know why

474

you brought a gun
into a kids' hospital.

475
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:56,901
It's a prop.
It's part of my act now.

476
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,903
That's bullshit. Bullshit.

477

What kind of clown
carries a fucking gun?

478
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,282
Besides, Randall told me

479
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:06,327
you tried to buy a .38
off him last week.

480
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:07,537
Randall told you that?

481
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:10,832
You're a fuck-up, Arthur,

Don't you approve?

00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:40,481
Where are the clowns?

Next stop, Hunter's Point.

541
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:07,777
Hey!

542
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:15,660
Stand clear of
the closing doors.

543
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:18,871

550
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:55,199
- [ears ringing loudly]
- Shit. Shit.

551
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,530
[panting]

[elevator bell dings]

553
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,666
[man 1 ] I read it was
a guy in full makeup.

554
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:53,294
[man 2] No, it says right here
it was a mask.

555
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,588
[man 1 ] Either way, I think
it's good for business.

556
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:58,090
They got clowns on the front
of every newspaper.

557
00:36:58,258 --> 00:36:59,466
Big man, what's the good word?

558
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:00,634
[Gary] Hey.

559
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:03,095
["My Name Is Carnival"
playing on radio]

560
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,973
Hey, Arthur,
I heard what happened.

561
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:07,433
Sorry, mate.

562
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:08,601
[Randall] Yeah.

563
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:10,519
It doesn't seem fair,

564
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:12,563
getting fired like that.

565
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:14,857
Did you really bring a gun

566
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,358
to the children's hospital,
Artie?

567
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:18,903
What the fuck
would you do that for?

568
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,506
Is that part of
your new act, Arthur?

569
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:21,632
If your dancing
doesn't do the trick,

570
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:22,925
you're just gonna
shoot yourself?

571
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:23,949
[men laughing]

572
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:25,701
Why don't you
ask Randall about it?

573
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:27,828
It was his gun.

574
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:29,849
- [Randall] What?
- I still owe you for that,

575
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:30,915
don't I?

576
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,833
What the fuck
are you talking about?

577
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,169
Stop talking
out of your ass, Art.

578
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,253
[honking horn]

579
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,675
[Arthur gasps] Oh, no!

580
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,137
I forgot to punch out.

581
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,808

["My Name Is Carnival"

583
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,604

King of all Hear me call

585
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:04,698
Hear my name Carnival

[Chuck on TV] And as our city
tries to make sense

587
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:21,340
of the brutal triple murder
on the subway last week,

588
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:23,008
we're joined by Thomas Wayne.

589
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:25,427
Happy, look,
Thomas Wayne's on TV.

590
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:26,762
Yes, Mother.

591
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,324
[Thomas] Thanks for
having me on, Chuck.

592
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:29,640
[Penny]
They're asking him about

593
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,183
those horrible subway murders.

594
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:32,631
[Chuck] Thank you, Thomas.
I know

595
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:34,436
this is a difficult time
for you.

596
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:36,271
Why him?

597
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,315
Looks like he's gained weight.

598
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,563
[Thomas] Yes, all three worked
for Wayne Investments.

599
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,569
Good, decent, educated.

600
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,364
Although I didn't know
any of them personally.

601
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:48,492
Like all Wayne employees,

602
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,869
past and present,
they're family.

603
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,757
Did you hear that?
I told you, we're family.

604
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:54,266
- [shushing]
- [Chuck] There now seems to be

605
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,542
a groundswell of anti-rich
sentiment in the city.

606
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,877
It's almost as if
our less fortunate residents

607
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:01,171
are taking the side
of the killer.

608
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,007
[Thomas] Yes, and it's a shame.

609
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,466
It's one of the reasons why

610
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:05,831
I'm considering a run for mayor.

611
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,846
Gotham's lost its way.

612
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:10,764
What about the eyewitness report

613
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:13,559
of the suspect being
a man in a clown mask?

614
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:15,728
[Thomas] Well,
it makes total sense to me.

615
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,135
What kind of coward would do
something that cold-blooded?

616
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:20,107
Someone who hides behind a mask.

617
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,151
Someone who is envious

618
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:25,654
of those more fortunate
than themselves,

619
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,158
yet they're too scared
to show their own face.

620
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:32,244
And until those kind of people
change for the better,

621
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:35,998
those of us who have
made something of our lives

622
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:38,500
will always look
at those who haven't

623
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:40,794
as nothing but clowns.

624
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:42,337
[laughs]

625
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:44,882
Thomas Wayne, thank you
for coming in this morning.

626
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,050
It's not funny.

627
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:06,528
[laughs]

628
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:10,032
I heard this song on the radio
the other day,

629
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:16,872
and the guy was singing
that his name was Carnival.

630
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:19,124
[social worker] Arthur...

631
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:20,459
Which is crazy,

632
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,881
because that's
my clown name at work.

633
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:29,426
And until a little while ago,

634
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,180
it was like nobody ever saw me.

635
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:37,601
Even I didn't know
if I really existed.

636
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:40,395
Arthur, I have
some bad news for you.

637
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:45,150
You don't listen, do you?

638
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:50,823
I don't think
you ever really hear me.

639
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:54,701
You just ask
the same questions every week.

640
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:58,163
"How's your job? Are you
having any negative thoughts?"

641
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:02,918
All I have are
negative thoughts,

642
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:05,921
but you don't listen anyway.

643
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:09,466
I said, for my whole life,

644
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:12,845
I didn't know
if I even really existed.

645
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,764
But I do.

646
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:21,145
And people are
starting to notice.

647
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,648
They've cut our funding.

648
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:26,483
We're closing down
our offices next week.

649
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,112
The city has cut funding
across the board.

650
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,156
Social Services is part of that.

651
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,366
This is the last time
we'll be meeting.

652
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,493
Okay.

653
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:42,787
They don't give a shit
about people like you, Arthur.

654
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:46,378
And they really
don't give a shit

655
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,422
about people like me, either.

656
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,010
Fuck.

657
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:03,729
How am I supposed to
get my medication now?

658
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:08,317
Who do I talk to?

659
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,571
I'm sorry, Arthur.

660
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,911
I think... I think most women
look at sex like buying a car.

661
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:21,997
You know, like, "Can I see
myself in this long-term?"

662
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:24,166
"Is it safe?"

663
00:42:24,334 --> 00:42:25,792
"Is it reliable?"

664
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,212
- "Could it kill me?"
- [audience laughing]

665
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:30,339
Most guys, we look at sex
like parking a car.

666
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,883
We're like, "There's a spot."

667
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,176
"There's another spot.

668
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,487
- "That would work."
- [Arthur exhales deeply]

669
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:38,013
"Oh, I have to pay?
Never mind."

671
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:42,434

was always told

that his purpose in life

680
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:07,834
was to bring laughter and joy
into this cold, dark world.

Here's one.

00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:57,527
You know, I was
just thinking the other day,

- why are the rich people...

You'll see the sun
Come shining through for you

Fuck 'em.

that did it is a hero.

That's the time you must keep on trying

726
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,890
Smile, what's the use of crying

727
00:46:09,058 --> 00:46:13,520
You'll find that
Life is still worthwhile

729
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:19,651

thanks for the laughs.

733
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:31,413
I'm sure we'll see you again.

734
00:46:31,581 --> 00:46:32,789
You know we'll be here, right?

- I hope.

You smell like cologne.

753

It's 'cause
I just had a big date.

Okay.

We were in love.

He said it was best that
we not be together

774
00:49:50,446 --> 00:49:52,572
because of appearances.

775
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:58,411
And I could never
tell anyone because...

776
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,415
Well, I signed some papers.

777
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:05,877

What's your name?

00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,052
I'm Bruce.

00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,304
Bruce.

795
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:06,516
I'm Arthur.

Who are you?

I'm here to see Mr. Wayne.

802
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:43,720
Well, you shouldn't be
speaking to his son.

803
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:46,449
Why did you give him
these flowers?

804

[Arthur] No, they're not real.

00:53:49,435 --> 00:53:51,477
It's magic.

806
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:53,354
I was just trying to
make him smile.

807
00:53:53,522 --> 00:53:55,356
Well, it's not funny, is it?

808
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:57,567
Do I need to call the police?

[Arthur] No. Please.

810
00:54:00,446 --> 00:54:03,656
My mother's name is Penny.
Penny Fleck.

811
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:05,051
She used to work here years ago.

812

Can you please tell Mr. Wayne
I need to see him?

813
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:09,787
You are her son.

00:54:11,624 --> 00:54:13,333
Did you know her?

[whispers]
I know about the two of them.

817
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:22,300
She told me everything.

818
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:25,970
[whispers]
There's nothing to know.

819
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,890
There is no "them."

820
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:32,018
Your mother was delusional.

821
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:34,020
She was a sick woman.

822
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:36,230
Don't say that.

823
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:38,816
Just go.

824
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:39,943
Mmm?

825
00:54:40,069 --> 00:54:42,320
Before you
make a fool of yourself.

826
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:46,658

Keep the respirations above 15.

Slow and steady.
We got some stairs coming up.

836
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:29,826
Mom?

837
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:31,661
What happened?

838
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,496
- Who are you?
- I'm her son.

839
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,141
- What happened?
- You can probably help us out inside.

840
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:36,582
We don't know what happened yet.

841
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:38,645
- Hop in the back of the ambulance.
- [paramedic 2] Step.

842
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:39,980
[paramedic 1 ] One more.
We got one more lift.

843
00:55:40,004 --> 00:55:41,045
[paramedic 2] I'm getting

844
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:42,357
a little resistance here,
Michael.

00:55:42,381 --> 00:55:44,966
[paramedics chattering

[paramedic 1 ] Lift.

847
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:52,932
[Arthur] I'm right here.

848
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:54,517
Excuse me, sir.

849
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:55,870
Does your mother take
any medications?

850
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:56,978
- No.
- Excuse me,

851
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:58,142
- I couldn't hear you.
- No.

852
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,833
Sir, when was the last time
you spoke to her?

853
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:01,024
I don't know.

854
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:03,943
[siren wailing]

855

[Garrity] Mr. Fleck.

856
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,490
Sorry to bother you.
I'm Detective Garrity.

857
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:52,867
This is my partner,
Detective Burke.

858
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:55,953
We had a few questions for
you, but you weren't home,

859
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:58,956
so we spoke with your mother.

860
00:57:00,709 --> 00:57:01,709
Oh.

861
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:04,295
What did you say to her?

862
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:05,463
Did you do this?

863
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:06,631
What? No.

864
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:09,258
No, no, no. We just
asked her some questions,

865
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:10,927
and she got hysterical.

866
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:12,845
Hyperventilating,

867
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:14,282
collapsed and
hit her head pretty hard.

868
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:16,432
Yeah. The doctor said
she had a stroke.

869
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:18,893
We're sorry to hear about that.

870
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:22,605
But, like I said, I still have
some questions for you.

871
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:24,053
They're about
the subway killings

872
00:57:24,108 --> 00:57:25,149
that happened last week.

873
00:57:25,317 --> 00:57:26,609
You've heard about them, right?

874
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:27,860
Yeah.

875
00:57:28,028 --> 00:57:29,028
It's horrible.

876
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:30,404
Right.

877
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:34,492
So, we spoke with your boss
over at Haha's.

878
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,702
He said you were fired
for bringing a gun

879
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:38,246
into the children's hospital.

880
00:57:39,748 --> 00:57:41,749
- Is that true, Mr. Fleck?
- It was a prop.

881
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:43,459
It's part of my act.

882
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:45,211
I'm a party clown.

883
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:47,296
All right.
So, why were you fired?

884
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:49,757
[sighs heavily]

885
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:53,136
They said I wasn't funny enough.

886
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:55,263
Can you imagine that?

887
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:59,267
If you don't mind, I have to
go take care of my mother.

888
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:01,686
[Burke] Your boss also
gave us one of your cards.

889
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:06,232
This condition of yours,
the laughing,

890
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:08,317
is it real,

891
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,319
or some sort of clown thing?

892
00:58:10,863 --> 00:58:13,364
- A clown thing?
- Yeah.

893
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:16,075
I mean, is it part of your act?

894
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:19,996
What do you think?

895
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,003
[Burke] It's exit only.

896
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:53,487
She's gonna be okay.

897
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,660
I'm gonna get a coffee.

898
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,370
You want one?

899
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:02,538
Yeah.

900
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:15,051
[audience laughing on TV]

901
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:18,638
[Murray] So, the other night,
I told my youngest son Billy,

902
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:21,265
you know, the new one,
the not-so-bright one.

903
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,601
I told him, "The garbage strike

904
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:24,936
is still going on, Billy."

905
00:59:25,145 --> 00:59:27,188
And he says, and I'm
not kidding, Billy says,

906
00:59:27,356 --> 00:59:29,316
"So, where are we gonna get
all our garbage from?"

907
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:31,067
- [laughs]
- [audience laughing]

908
00:59:31,735 --> 00:59:33,152
[audience applauding]

909
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:39,158
And finally,
in a world where everyone

910
00:59:39,243 --> 00:59:40,576
thinks they could do my job,

911
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:42,954
we got this video tape
from Pogo's Comedy Club,

912
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:44,163
right here in Gotham.

913
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:46,291
Here's a guy who thinks
if you just keep laughing,

914
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,125
it'll somehow make you funny.

915
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:49,543
Check out this joker.

916
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:53,339
[laughing]

917
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,342
Oh, my God.

918
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:59,971
[Arthur on TV]
I hated school as a kid.

919
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:03,891
But my mother would always say,

920
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:05,643
[imitates Penny]
"You should enjoy it.

921
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:07,853
One day, you'll have to
work for a living."

922
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:10,064
[normal voice]
"No, I won't, Ma.

923
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:11,857
I'm gonna be a comedian."

924
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:14,610
- [laughing]
- [Arthur laughing on TV]

925
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:20,283
[laughs] You shoulda listened
to your mother.

926
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:22,368
[audience laughing
and applauding]

927
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:24,120
Hey, one more.
One more, Bobby.

928
01:00:24,288 --> 01:00:26,706
All right, let's see one more.
I love this guy.

929
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:28,541
[Arthur] It's funny,

930
01:00:29,418 --> 01:00:31,544
when I was a little boy

931
01:00:31,712 --> 01:00:34,547
and told people
I was gonna be a comedian,

932
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:36,757
everyone laughed at me.

933
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:39,719
Well, no one's laughing now.

934
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:42,221
[audience laughing]

935
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:45,099
You can say that again, pal.

936
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:46,684
[audience applauding]

937
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:53,733
All right, we got a great show
for you tonight.

938
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:57,069
Chuck Conby is here,
actress Joanne Mulligan,

939
01:00:57,237 --> 01:01:01,073
and new music from
Mel Rubin and the Stiffs.

940
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:09,582
[news anchor] As tensions mount
around the metro area,

941
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:13,336
Mayor Stokes has pleaded
for cooler heads to prevail.

942
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:15,087
City services
have been affected,

943
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:17,256
and some businesses have decided

944
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:20,134
to remain closed
amid the unrest.

945
01:01:20,302 --> 01:01:22,887
Chuck Stevens filed this report.

946
01:01:23,055 --> 01:01:24,282
[Chuck]
The anger and resentment

947
01:01:24,306 --> 01:01:25,742
that's been building
in the city for weeks

948
01:01:25,766 --> 01:01:27,767
seems close to exploding.

949
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:29,977
Protesters,
many dressed as clowns,

950
01:01:30,062 --> 01:01:31,187
took to the streets today

951
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:33,189
in one of
several planned demonstrations

952
01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:34,815
taking on the city's elite,

953
01:01:34,983 --> 01:01:36,734
including a massive rally
outside

954
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:39,236
tomorrow night's
benefit at Wayne Hall.

955
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:41,049
[reporter 1 ]
What's the point of all this?

956
01:01:41,073 --> 01:01:42,907
[bleep] the rich.
[bleep] Thomas Wayne.

957
01:01:42,991 --> 01:01:44,677
That's what this whole [bleep]
thing is about.

958
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,577
[bleep] the whole system.

959
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:47,889
[Chuck] Wayne,
who recently announced

960
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:49,121
he is running for mayor,

961
01:01:49,289 --> 01:01:50,998
will be attending the benefit.

962
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:53,167
You might remember
it was Thomas Wayne

963
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:54,710
who first referred to

964
01:01:54,795 --> 01:01:57,588
many of Gotham's residents
as "clowns."

965
01:01:57,756 --> 01:02:00,758
Today, he offered little in
the way of an apology.

966
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:02,176
Well, what I will say is,

967
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:03,529
there's something wrong
with those people.

968
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:04,553
I am here to help them.

969
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,074
I'm gonna
lift them out of poverty,

970
01:02:06,098 --> 01:02:07,515
help make their lives better.

971
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:08,849
That is why I'm running.

972
01:02:09,017 --> 01:02:11,769
And they may not realize it,
but I'm their only hope.

973
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:13,479
[protesters shouting]

974
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:30,287
[protesters] Down with Wayne!
Down with Wayne!

975
01:02:30,372 --> 01:02:33,124
Down with Wayne!
Down with Wayne!

976
01:02:35,377 --> 01:02:37,086
[shouting continues]

977
01:02:45,137 --> 01:02:46,512
[policemen shouting]

978
01:03:09,244 --> 01:03:10,744
[lively music playing in cinema]

979
01:03:20,964 --> 01:03:23,424
- [indistinct chattering]
- [audience laughing]

980
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,186

[door opens]

984
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,029
[door closes]

985
01:05:13,702 --> 01:05:14,785
Can I help you, pal?

986
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:18,706
I don't know what to say.

987
01:05:18,999 --> 01:05:20,207
[flushing]

988
01:05:20,709 --> 01:05:21,709
[Thomas chuckles]

989
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:24,545
Do you want an autograph
or something?

990
01:05:24,713 --> 01:05:25,713
No.

991
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:33,387
My name is Arthur.

992
01:05:34,973 --> 01:05:36,599
Penny Fleck is my mother.

993
01:05:37,976 --> 01:05:38,976
Jesus.

994
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:41,901
You're the guy that came to
my house yesterday.

995
01:05:43,315 --> 01:05:44,565
- Yes.
- [Thomas laughs]

996
01:05:45,108 --> 01:05:46,984
I'm sorry I just showed up.

997
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:48,611
But my mother
told me everything,

998
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:50,362
and I had to talk to you.

999
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:52,448
Look, pal, I'm not your father.

1000
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:54,533
[chuckling]
What's wrong with you?

1001
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:57,745
Look at us.

1002
01:05:59,247 --> 01:06:00,497
I think you are.

1003
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:01,874
Well, that's impossible

1004
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:03,709
because you're adopted,

1005
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,021
and I never slept with
your mother.

1006
01:06:05,045 --> 01:06:06,647
- I wasn't adopted.
- What do you want from me?

1007
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:08,047
- Money?
- No, I don't...

1008
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:09,256
I wasn't adopted.

1009
01:06:09,424 --> 01:06:11,216
Jesus. She never told you?

1010
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:13,052
Told me what?

1011
01:06:13,178 --> 01:06:14,303
[sighs]

1012
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:16,365
Your mother adopted you
while she was working for us.

1013
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:17,598
That's not true.

1014
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:19,141
Why are you saying that?

1015
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:20,369
Then she was arrested
and committed

1016
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:21,560
to Arkham State Hospital,

1017
01:06:21,728 --> 01:06:23,103
when you were just a little boy.

1018
01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:24,396
Why are you saying this?

1019
01:06:24,564 --> 01:06:26,065
I don't need you to
tell me lies.

1020
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:27,566
I know it seems strange.

1021
01:06:27,651 --> 01:06:29,276
I don't mean to
make you uncomfortable.

1022
01:06:29,444 --> 01:06:31,028
I don't know
why everyone is so rude.

1023
01:06:31,196 --> 01:06:32,404
I don't know why you are.

1024
01:06:32,572 --> 01:06:33,906
I don't want anything from you.

1025
01:06:34,074 --> 01:06:36,450
Maybe a little bit of warmth,
maybe a hug, Dad!

1026
01:06:36,618 --> 01:06:38,619
How about just a little bit
of fucking decency?

1027
01:06:38,787 --> 01:06:40,162
What is it with you people?

1028
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:42,289
You say that stuff
about my mother.

1029
01:06:42,457 --> 01:06:43,832
She's crazy.

1030
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:46,001
She's... [laughing]

1031
01:06:53,593 --> 01:06:54,968
You think this is funny?

1032
01:06:56,596 --> 01:06:59,765
Dad, it's me. Come on.

1033
01:07:01,393 --> 01:07:02,393
[groans]

1034
01:07:02,477 --> 01:07:03,644
[Thomas] Touch my son again,

1035
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:05,168
- I'll fucking kill you.

1036

[answering machine beeps]

1040
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:27,835
Hello, Mr. Fleck.
This is Detective Garrity.

1041
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:30,337
We met the other night
at Gotham General.

1042
01:07:30,505 --> 01:07:32,798
My partner and I had a few
more questions for you.

1043
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:35,884
We stopped by your apartment
today, but you weren't home.

1044
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:37,932
Please give me a call
when you get this message.

1045
01:07:37,971 --> 01:07:39,888
Again, Detective Garrity,

1046
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:44,059
and my number is 212... 99.

1047
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:46,395
[answering machine beeps]

1048
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:15,716
[phone ringing]

1049
01:08:25,435 --> 01:08:26,560
[answering machine beeps]

1050
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:28,937
[Shirley] This message is
for Arthur Fleck.

1051
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,814
My name is Shirley Woods.

1052
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:33,066
I work on
The Murray Franklin Show.

1053
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:34,378
I don't know if you're aware,

1054
01:08:34,402 --> 01:08:36,002
but Murray played
a clip of your stand-up

1055
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:37,070
on the show recently,

1056
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:40,532
and we have gotten an amazing
response from our viewers.

1057
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,910
Murray asked me to give you
a call and see if you're...

1058
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:48,665
Who is this?

1059
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:50,459
Oh, hi, this is Shirley Woods.

1060
01:08:50,627 --> 01:08:53,420
I'm the show Booker from
Live with Murray Franklin.

1061
01:08:53,588 --> 01:08:54,630
Is this Arthur?

1062
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:57,633
Yes.

1063
01:08:57,801 --> 01:08:59,760
Hi, Arthur.
Well, as I was saying,

1064
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:01,845
we've gotten a lot of calls
about your clip.

1065
01:09:02,013 --> 01:09:03,722
Amazing responses.

1066
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:06,183
And Murray asked
if I would reach out to you

1067
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:07,893
to see if you would
come on as his guest.

1068
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:16,318
Murray wants me
on The Murray Franklin Show?

1069
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:18,070
Yeah. Isn't that great?

1070
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:21,114
He'd love to talk to you,
maybe do some of your act?

1071
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:24,284
That sound good to you?

1072
01:09:28,623 --> 01:09:30,666
Yeah, that sounds great.

1073
01:09:30,834 --> 01:09:32,668
Can we set up a date right now?

1074
01:09:32,752 --> 01:09:34,461
Are you available next Thursday?

1075
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:08,787

[indistinct announcement on PA]

1077
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:28,181
[clerk] Hey.

1078
01:10:29,017 --> 01:10:31,977
[sighs] Man,
I'm sorry about that, my man.

1079
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:34,415
All records 10 years or older,
they store in the basement,

1080
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:37,441
and you're talking about
something 30 years ago, so...

1081
01:10:38,818 --> 01:10:40,777
Can I ask you a question?

1082
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:42,154
Sure.

1083
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:46,658
How does someone
wind up in here?

1084
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:51,246
Have they all, all the people
committed crimes?

1085
01:10:51,873 --> 01:10:53,540
Well, yeah, some have.

1086
01:10:53,708 --> 01:10:56,585
You know, some are just crazy.

1087
01:10:56,753 --> 01:10:59,212
Pose dangers to
themselves and others.

1088
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:00,964
Some just got
nowhere else to go.

1089
01:11:01,049 --> 01:11:03,133
Don't know what to do, you know?

1090
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:06,970
- Yeah. I hear you, brother.
- Hmm.

1091
01:11:07,055 --> 01:11:09,890
Sometimes,
I don't know what to do.

1092
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:14,102
Last time, I ended up taking
it out on some people.

1093
01:11:15,563 --> 01:11:19,191
I thought it was gonna bother
me, but it really hasn't.

1094
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:21,526
What's that?

1095
01:11:23,071 --> 01:11:26,448
I fucked up and
did some bad shit.

1096

[chuckles]

1097
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:31,555
You know what I'm talking about,

1098
01:11:31,579 --> 01:11:36,917
it's so hard to just try and
be happy all the time.

1099
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:40,712
Hey, listen, man.

1100
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:43,173
I'm just
an administrative assistant.

1101
01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:44,758
Like a clerk, you know.

1102
01:11:44,926 --> 01:11:46,510
All I do is file paperwork.

1103
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:49,346
I don't know what to tell you.

1104
01:11:49,514 --> 01:11:51,306
But you should see somebody.

1105
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:52,724
You know, they got programs,

1106

1107
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,853
Oh, yeah.

Penny Fleck. Let's see.

1112

Diagnosed by
Dr. Benjamin Stoner.

1113
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:17,791
Oh. "The patient suffers
from delusional psychosis

1114
01:12:17,959 --> 01:12:21,420

personality disorder." Mmm.

1115

"Was found guilty of endangering

1116
01:12:23,798 --> 01:12:27,217

What?

1118
01:12:39,939 --> 01:12:41,398
You said she's your mother.

1119
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:47,487
Uh...

1120
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:50,073
I'm sorry, man. Like I said,
I can't release these records,

1121
01:12:50,241 --> 01:12:52,993
you know, without proper forms.

1122
01:12:53,453 --> 01:12:55,120
I could get in trouble.

1123
01:12:55,913 --> 01:12:57,956
Look, if you want to bring
your mom in here to sign,

1124
01:12:58,124 --> 01:12:59,124
that'll be much easier,

1125
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:02,335
but I can't let this go
without her signature, okay?

1126
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:03,503
I'm sorry.

1127
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:09,885
No, man! Shit!

1128
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:12,345
Come on, man. Give it...

01:14:13,741 --> 01:14:16,660
[Stoner] We went over this,
Penny. You adopted him.

1133
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:19,162
We have all the paperwork
right here.

1134
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:22,082
[Young Penny] That's not true.

1135
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:24,501
Thomas had that all made up,

1136
01:14:24,669 --> 01:14:27,295
so it stayed our secret.

1137

while one of your boyfriends

1140
01:14:33,678 --> 01:14:37,139
repeatedly abused
your adopted son

1141
01:14:38,516 --> 01:14:39,516
and battered you.

1142
01:14:44,355 --> 01:14:45,647
[laughing]

1143
01:14:59,287 --> 01:15:00,871
Penny,

1144
01:15:01,455 --> 01:15:05,083
your son was found tied
to a radiator

1145
01:15:05,251 --> 01:15:07,669
in your filthy apartment.

1146

Malnourished with multiple
bruises across his body

1147
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:12,507

[Young Penny]
I never heard him cry.

such a happy little boy.

1161

You live down the hall.

I really need you to leave.

in the other room.

1164

Please.

1165
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:08,391

1166
01:18:11,228 --> 01:18:13,730

Is your mother home?

I always hated that name.

1181

You know how you used to tell me

1182
01:20:23,694 --> 01:20:26,321
that my laugh was a condition?

1183
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:29,949
That there was
something wrong with me?

1184
01:20:33,037 --> 01:20:34,245
There isn't.

1185

1250
01:24:58,302 --> 01:25:00,344
[chorus] That's life

1251
01:25:00,429 --> 01:25:03,639
[man] And as funny as it may seem

1252
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:06,684
Some people get their kicks

1253
01:25:07,394 --> 01:25:10,062
Stompin' on a dream

1254
01:25:10,814 --> 01:25:14,567
But I don't let it,
let it get me down

1255
01:25:16,361 --> 01:25:18,696
'Cause this fine old world

1256
01:25:18,781 --> 01:25:21,282
It keeps spinnin' around

1257
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:25,369
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate

1258
01:25:25,454 --> 01:25:28,956
A poet, a pawn and a king

1259
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:33,085
I've been up and down and over and out

1260
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:35,296
And I know one thing

1261
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:41,010
Each time I find myself flat on my face

1262
01:25:42,012 --> 01:25:48,184
I pick myself up
And get back in the race

1263
01:25:48,268 --> 01:25:49,393
That's life

1264
01:25:49,478 --> 01:25:51,158
- [doorbell buzzing]
- [chorus] That's life

1265
01:25:51,230 --> 01:25:54,106
[man] I tell ya, I can't deny it

1266
01:25:55,692 --> 01:25:57,568
I thought of quitting, baby

1267
01:25:58,821 --> 01:26:01,364
But my heart just ain't gonna buy it

1268
01:26:01,448 --> 01:26:04,909
And if I didn't think
It was worth one single try

1269
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:06,327
[doorbell buzzing insistently]

1270
01:26:07,663 --> 01:26:08,746
Coming.

1271
01:26:08,831 --> 01:26:12,375
I'd jump right on a big bird
And then I'd fly...

1272
01:26:19,842 --> 01:26:21,259
[Gary] Hey, Arthur.

1273
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:22,426
How's it going?

1274
01:26:23,428 --> 01:26:24,720
Oh, hey, guys.

1275
01:26:25,264 --> 01:26:26,389
Come on in.

1276
01:26:26,849 --> 01:26:27,974
Did you get a new gig?

1277
01:26:28,684 --> 01:26:29,684
No.

1278
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:33,646
Oh, you must be going down to
that rally at City Hall.

1279
01:26:33,814 --> 01:26:35,481
I hear it's gonna be nuts.

1280
01:26:35,649 --> 01:26:37,233
Oh, is that today?

1281
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:38,943
Yeah.

1282
01:26:39,862 --> 01:26:41,279
What's with the makeup then?

1283
01:26:42,739 --> 01:26:44,240
My mom died.

1284
01:26:44,408 --> 01:26:45,616
I'm celebrating.

1285
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:47,535
Right. We heard.

1286
01:26:47,703 --> 01:26:48,744
That's why we came by.

1287
01:26:48,912 --> 01:26:51,622
We figured, you know, you
could use some cheering up.

1288
01:26:52,165 --> 01:26:53,791
[Arthur] Aw, that's sweet.

1289
01:26:53,959 --> 01:26:56,836
But, no, I feel good.

1290
01:26:57,629 --> 01:26:59,255
Yeah, I stopped
taking my medication.

1291
01:26:59,423 --> 01:27:01,048
I feel a lot better now.

1292
01:27:03,176 --> 01:27:05,678
Oh, okay. Good for you.

1293
01:27:07,806 --> 01:27:10,683
So, hey, listen,
I don't know if you heard,

1294
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:13,269
but the cops have been coming
around the shop,

1295
01:27:14,021 --> 01:27:17,940
talking to all the guys
about those subway murders.

1296
01:27:18,066 --> 01:27:19,859
- And, um...
- They didn't talk to me.

1297
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:24,488
That's because the suspect
was a regular-sized person.

1298
01:27:25,032 --> 01:27:27,533
If it was a fucking midget,
you'd be in jail right now.

1299
01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:30,077
[Arthur laughing]

1300
01:27:33,332 --> 01:27:34,582
Anyway, um,

1301
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:38,753
Hoyt said
that they talked to you,

1302
01:27:38,921 --> 01:27:40,212
and now they're looking for me,

1303
01:27:40,297 --> 01:27:41,881
and I just wanna know
what you said.

1304
01:27:42,049 --> 01:27:43,466
Make sure our stories line up.

1305
01:27:43,634 --> 01:27:46,677
- Seeing as how you're my boy.
- Yeah, that's important.

1306
01:27:46,845 --> 01:27:48,656
- That makes a lot of sense.
- You know what I mean?

1307
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:50,348
Thank you, Randall.
Thank you so much.

1308
01:27:50,933 --> 01:27:52,453
- [Randall groaning]
- [Gary screaming]

1309
01:27:56,146 --> 01:27:57,146
[Gary] Arthur!

1310
01:27:57,814 --> 01:27:59,148
- No!
- [Randall's head thudding]

1311
01:28:00,484 --> 01:28:01,484
What?

1312
01:28:02,819 --> 01:28:03,819
No!

1313
01:28:05,447 --> 01:28:06,807
- [Arthur panting]
- [Gary sobbing]

1314
01:28:11,745 --> 01:28:13,829
Why would you do that, Arthur?

1315
01:28:13,997 --> 01:28:16,374
- [breathing rapidly]
- [Gary continues sobbing]

1316
01:28:34,893 --> 01:28:37,061
Do you watch
The Murray Franklin Show?

1317
01:28:37,145 --> 01:28:38,562
- [Gary whimpering]
- Yeah.

1318
01:28:39,898 --> 01:28:41,691
I'm gonna be on tonight.

1319
01:28:41,942 --> 01:28:43,484
[whimpering]

1320
01:28:45,988 --> 01:28:47,738
[in cockney accent]
It fucking crazy, innit?

1321
01:28:47,823 --> 01:28:49,657
Me on the telly.

1322
01:28:51,702 --> 01:28:53,661
What the fuck, Arthur?

1323
01:28:54,913 --> 01:28:55,997
[normal voice] What?

1324
01:29:01,003 --> 01:29:02,211
It's okay, Gary.

1325
01:29:02,671 --> 01:29:03,671
You can go.

1326
01:29:03,922 --> 01:29:04,922
[Gary groaning]

1327
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:07,883
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1328
01:29:10,846 --> 01:29:12,304
Oh!

1329
01:29:12,556 --> 01:29:14,640
Don't look. Just go.

1330
01:29:19,479 --> 01:29:20,479
[Arthur yells]

1331
01:29:21,648 --> 01:29:23,065
[whimpering]

1332
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:28,195
[crying] Fuck.

1333
01:29:29,114 --> 01:29:30,322
[sighs tearfully]

1334
01:29:33,493 --> 01:29:34,660
Hey, Arthur?

1335
01:29:34,828 --> 01:29:35,828
Yeah?

1336
01:29:37,039 --> 01:29:39,457
[stammering]
Arthur, can you get the lock?

1337
01:29:42,669 --> 01:29:43,669
Shit.

1338
01:29:44,129 --> 01:29:45,588
Sorry, Gary.

1339
01:29:56,558 --> 01:29:57,600
Gary?

1340
01:29:57,768 --> 01:29:58,768
Yeah.

1341
01:30:01,313 --> 01:30:03,898
You were the only one
that was ever nice to me.

1342
01:30:05,984 --> 01:30:07,193
Skedaddle.

1343
01:30:11,156 --> 01:30:12,323
[exhales]

1344
01:30:16,369 --> 01:30:18,329
[rock music playing]

1345
01:30:22,834 --> 01:30:23,834
[elevator bell dings]

1346
01:31:03,625 --> 01:31:05,417
[sinister music playing]

1347
01:31:34,406 --> 01:31:35,739
Hey, Arthur!

1348
01:31:35,907 --> 01:31:37,283
We need to talk.

1349
01:31:37,534 --> 01:31:38,659
[Arthur] Oh!

1350
01:31:38,743 --> 01:31:40,744
Hey! Stop, Arthur!

1351
01:31:46,168 --> 01:31:47,251
[Garrity] Arthur!

1352
01:31:49,838 --> 01:31:51,463
Watch it!
Out of the way!

1353
01:31:54,634 --> 01:31:55,634
[Burke] Move!

1354
01:31:57,637 --> 01:31:58,677
- [horns honking]
- Arthur!

1355
01:31:59,681 --> 01:32:00,931
Shit.

1356
01:32:03,310 --> 01:32:04,393
[detectives] Hey! Hey!

1357
01:32:11,443 --> 01:32:12,443
[Garrity] Arthur, stop!

1358
01:32:18,158 --> 01:32:19,158
[Burke] Go! Go!

1359
01:32:21,286 --> 01:32:23,286
[announcer on PA] Now
departing, O-Train, downtown.

1360
01:32:25,123 --> 01:32:26,874
Stand clear of
the closing doors.

1361
01:32:29,127 --> 01:32:30,127
[panting]

1362
01:32:33,715 --> 01:32:35,090
[Garrity shouting]

1363
01:32:36,301 --> 01:32:38,928
Hold that train! Hold it!

1364
01:32:40,847 --> 01:32:42,056
Get out! Get outta here!

1365
01:32:43,183 --> 01:32:44,823
[announcer on PA]
Next stop, Bedford Park.

1366
01:32:53,610 --> 01:32:54,818
[crowd yelling]

1367
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:00,199
Masks off!

1368
01:33:00,367 --> 01:33:01,742
Get your mask off!

1369
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:04,328
Signs down! Now!

1370
01:33:13,505 --> 01:33:14,964
Police! Signs down!

1371
01:33:16,132 --> 01:33:17,216
Signs down.

1372
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:23,097
What the fuck!

1373
01:33:24,307 --> 01:33:25,307
[both grunting]

1374
01:33:26,017 --> 01:33:27,577
- [man] Beat his ass!
- [crowd shouting]

1375
01:33:33,942 --> 01:33:35,484
Stop fighting! Police!

1376
01:33:35,652 --> 01:33:37,778
Police! Get down!

1377
01:33:39,948 --> 01:33:42,074
Get down! Get the fuck back!

1378
01:33:43,159 --> 01:33:44,159
Police! Get down.

1379
01:33:45,078 --> 01:33:46,203
Get the fuck down!

1380
01:33:50,917 --> 01:33:53,335
Stay the fuck back! Down!

1381
01:33:53,878 --> 01:33:54,878
[gunshot]

1382
01:33:55,213 --> 01:33:56,213
[groans]

1383
01:33:56,965 --> 01:33:57,965
What the...

1384
01:34:01,344 --> 01:34:02,344
Arthur!

1385
01:34:02,929 --> 01:34:03,971
Burke!

1386
01:34:04,222 --> 01:34:05,574
- [Arthur laughing]
- [crowd shouting]

1387
01:34:05,598 --> 01:34:07,057
Don't do it!

1388
01:34:19,571 --> 01:34:20,571
[laughs]

1389
01:34:56,900 --> 01:34:58,067
Two officers on the train

1390
01:34:58,151 --> 01:34:59,671
were violently confronted
by the crowd,

1391
01:34:59,736 --> 01:35:01,153
and tonight are in serious

1392
01:35:01,237 --> 01:35:03,447
but stable condition
at Gotham Metropolitan.

1393
01:35:03,531 --> 01:35:05,115
- [laughs]
- We're going live now to

1394
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:06,992
co-anchor Courtney Weathers,

1395
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:09,160
who's standing by outside
the Bedford Park Station,

1396
01:35:09,245 --> 01:35:11,080
near where the shooting
took place.

1397
01:35:11,247 --> 01:35:13,123
Courtney,
what's the scene there?

1398
01:35:13,208 --> 01:35:14,375
[knocking on door]

1399
01:35:14,459 --> 01:35:15,459
[door opens]

1400
01:35:18,129 --> 01:35:19,171
Murray.

1401
01:35:19,339 --> 01:35:20,923
Hey, hey, hey.
It's Mr. Franklin, buddy.

1402
01:35:21,091 --> 01:35:23,467
Oh, come on, Gene.
That's all bullshit.

1403
01:35:24,552 --> 01:35:25,761
Thank you, Murray.

1404
01:35:26,971 --> 01:35:28,722
I feel like I know you.

1405
01:35:29,224 --> 01:35:31,058
I've been watching you forever.

1406
01:35:31,226 --> 01:35:32,351
Thank you.

1407
01:35:32,519 --> 01:35:33,811
What's with the face?

1408
01:35:33,978 --> 01:35:35,938
I mean,
are you part of the protest?

1409
01:35:36,106 --> 01:35:37,106
No.

1410
01:35:37,273 --> 01:35:39,024
No, I don't believe
in any of that.

1411
01:35:39,734 --> 01:35:41,318
I don't believe in anything.

1412
01:35:41,945 --> 01:35:43,487
I just thought
it'd be good for my act.

1413
01:35:43,655 --> 01:35:45,155
For your act? Didn't you hear

1414
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:46,717
what happened on the subway?
Some clown got killed.

1415
01:35:46,741 --> 01:35:48,427
He's aware of that.
He's aware of that. Yeah.

1416
01:35:48,451 --> 01:35:49,701
No, I hadn't heard.

1417
01:35:50,161 --> 01:35:51,245
- Yeah.
- You see?

1418
01:35:51,329 --> 01:35:52,723
This is what I'm telling you.
The audience is gonna go crazy

1419
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:53,747
if you put this guy on.

1420
01:35:53,873 --> 01:35:55,999
Maybe for a bit,
but not a whole segment.

1421
01:35:56,167 --> 01:35:58,377
Gene, it's gonna work.
It's gonna work.

1422
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:01,250
- We're gonna go with it.
- [Arthur and Murray laugh]

1423
01:36:01,506 --> 01:36:02,506
Thank you, Murray.

1424
01:36:03,091 --> 01:36:04,216
Couple rules, though.

1425
01:36:04,384 --> 01:36:06,135
No cursing.
No off-color material.

1426
01:36:06,302 --> 01:36:07,761
We do a clean show.

1427
01:36:07,929 --> 01:36:08,929
- Okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

1428
01:36:09,097 --> 01:36:10,681
You'll go on
right after Dr. Sally.

1429
01:36:10,849 --> 01:36:11,849
I love Dr. Sally.

1430
01:36:12,016 --> 01:36:13,434
Good, good. Someone will

1431
01:36:13,518 --> 01:36:15,686
- come and get you, okay?
- Okay. Perfect.

1432
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:16,895
Good luck.

1433
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:17,980
- Thanks, Murray.
- Okay.

1434
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:22,401
- Murray, one small thing.
- Yeah.

1435
01:36:22,569 --> 01:36:24,236
When you bring me out,

1436
01:36:24,404 --> 01:36:26,280
can you introduce me as Joker?

1437
01:36:26,448 --> 01:36:28,157
What's wrong
with your real name?

1438
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:31,034
That's what you called me
on the show.

1439
01:36:31,202 --> 01:36:32,327
A joker.

1440
01:36:32,495 --> 01:36:33,495
Do you remember?

1441
01:36:33,872 --> 01:36:35,873
- Did I?
- [Gene] I don't know.

1442
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:38,125
Well, if you say so, kid,
you know, Joker it is.

1443
01:36:38,293 --> 01:36:39,293
It's good.

1444
01:36:39,461 --> 01:36:40,544
Thanks, Murray.

1445
01:36:53,349 --> 01:36:54,558
[gun clicks]

1446
01:37:02,817 --> 01:37:03,919
[Murray] I'll try it, you know,

1447
01:37:03,943 --> 01:37:05,819
but I'm not sure
my wife will let me do it.

1448
01:37:05,904 --> 01:37:07,196
[audience laughing]

1449
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:08,614
Maybe my next wife.

1450
01:37:08,865 --> 01:37:10,465
- [Murray laughing]
- [audience cheering]

1451
01:37:12,327 --> 01:37:14,077
You gotta see
our next guest for yourself.

1452
01:37:14,245 --> 01:37:16,288
I'm pretty sure
this guy could use a doctor.

1453
01:37:16,623 --> 01:37:17,683
- [audience laughing]
- [Dr. Sally] Oh!

1454
01:37:17,707 --> 01:37:19,082
Does he have sexual problems?

1455
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:21,668
[Murray] Oh, he looks like
he's got a lot of problems.

1456
01:37:21,753 --> 01:37:22,794
[audience laughing]

1457
01:37:22,879 --> 01:37:25,506
All right, Bobby, let's show
that clip one last time.

1458
01:37:25,757 --> 01:37:27,382
[Arthur laughing on video]

1459
01:37:31,930 --> 01:37:34,806
[Arthur]
I hated school as a kid.

1460
01:37:36,601 --> 01:37:38,769
But my mother would always say,

1461
01:37:39,812 --> 01:37:41,123
[imitates Penny]
"You should enjoy it.

1462
01:37:41,147 --> 01:37:44,274
One day, you'll have to
work for a living."

1463
01:37:44,442 --> 01:37:45,669
[normal voice]
"No, I won't, Ma.

1464
01:37:45,693 --> 01:37:47,653
I'm gonna be a comedian."

1465
01:37:47,737 --> 01:37:49,571
[Arthur laughing on video]

1466
01:37:53,952 --> 01:37:56,245
- [Murray] Okay. You may...
- [audience laughing]

1467
01:37:57,705 --> 01:38:00,958
You may have seen that clip
of our next guest.

1468
01:38:01,125 --> 01:38:03,502
Now, before he comes out,
I just want to say

1469
01:38:03,670 --> 01:38:05,170
that we're all heartbroken

1470
01:38:05,255 --> 01:38:07,214
about what's going on
in the city tonight.

1471
01:38:07,382 --> 01:38:09,675
But this is
how he wanted to come out,

1472
01:38:09,842 --> 01:38:13,053
and honestly, I think
we could all use a good laugh.

1473
01:38:13,221 --> 01:38:15,389
So, please welcome, Joker.

1474
01:38:16,599 --> 01:38:18,600
- [music playing]
- [audience applauding]

1475
01:38:30,488 --> 01:38:32,197
[audience cheering]

1476
01:38:43,918 --> 01:38:45,419
[audience whooping
and whistling]

1477
01:38:58,016 --> 01:38:59,391
Are you all right, Doctor?

1478
01:38:59,475 --> 01:39:00,767
[audience laughing]

1479
01:39:03,229 --> 01:39:05,689
Well,
that was quite an entrance.

1480
01:39:09,777 --> 01:39:11,320
[scattered laughter
from audience]

1481
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:13,238
You okay?

1482
01:39:16,075 --> 01:39:17,492
Yeah.

1483
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:20,370
This is exactly
how I imagined it.

1484
01:39:22,332 --> 01:39:24,124
Well, that makes one of us.

1485
01:39:24,208 --> 01:39:25,626
[audience laughing]

1486
01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:26,710
[audience applauding]

1487
01:39:31,007 --> 01:39:33,175
So, can you tell us
about this look?

1488
01:39:33,343 --> 01:39:34,676
When we spoke earlier,

1489
01:39:34,761 --> 01:39:36,864
you mentioned that this look
is not a political statement.

1490
01:39:36,888 --> 01:39:37,929
Is that right?

1491
01:39:38,097 --> 01:39:39,723
That's right, Murray.
I'm not political.

1492
01:39:39,891 --> 01:39:42,434
I'm just trying to
make people laugh.

1493
01:39:42,602 --> 01:39:44,682
- And how's that going for you?
- [audience laughing]

1494
01:39:45,438 --> 01:39:46,938
[laughing]

1495
01:39:52,695 --> 01:39:54,529
So, I know you're a comedian.

1496
01:39:54,697 --> 01:39:56,531
You been working on
any new material?

1497
01:39:56,616 --> 01:39:57,741
You wanna tell us a joke?

1498
01:39:58,660 --> 01:39:59,826
[audience applauding]

1499
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:04,456
Yeah?

1500
01:40:06,626 --> 01:40:07,626
Okay.

1501
01:40:11,339 --> 01:40:12,714
[audience laughing]

1502
01:40:13,675 --> 01:40:15,300
He's got a book.

1503
01:40:16,219 --> 01:40:17,678
A book of jokes.

1504
01:40:27,522 --> 01:40:28,897
Take your time.
We got all night.

1505
01:40:29,315 --> 01:40:30,816
[audience laughing]

1506
01:40:32,568 --> 01:40:33,568
[Murray chuckles]

1507
01:40:34,946 --> 01:40:37,239
Okay, okay. Here's one.

1508
01:40:40,368 --> 01:40:42,869
Knock, knock.

1509
01:40:43,037 --> 01:40:44,371
And you had to look that up?

1510
01:40:44,706 --> 01:40:46,026
- [laughing]
- [audience laughing]

1511
01:40:46,499 --> 01:40:47,916
[audience applauding]

1512
01:40:51,504 --> 01:40:53,130
I want to get it right.

1513
01:40:54,966 --> 01:40:56,508
Knock, knock.

1514
01:40:56,676 --> 01:40:58,176
Who's there?

1515
01:40:59,637 --> 01:41:01,054
It's the police, ma'am.

1516
01:41:01,222 --> 01:41:03,056
Your son's been hit
by a drunk driver.

1517
01:41:03,224 --> 01:41:05,642
- He's dead. [laughing]
- [audience gasps]

1518
01:41:06,185 --> 01:41:07,394
[plays sad note]

1519
01:41:07,562 --> 01:41:09,146
- [audience booing]
- Oh, no, no, no.

1520
01:41:09,313 --> 01:41:11,064
No, you cannot joke about that.

1521
01:41:11,232 --> 01:41:13,191
Yeah, that's not funny, Arthur.

1522
01:41:13,359 --> 01:41:15,819
That's not the kind of humor
we do on this show.

1523
01:41:16,404 --> 01:41:18,697
Okay. I'm... Yeah, I'm sorry.

1524
01:41:18,865 --> 01:41:23,243
It's just, you know, it's been
a rough few weeks, Murray.

1525
01:41:23,327 --> 01:41:24,745
[chuckling]

1526
01:41:24,829 --> 01:41:26,663
Ever since

1527
01:41:29,208 --> 01:41:31,334
I killed
those three Wall Street guys.

1528
01:41:31,502 --> 01:41:32,669
[all gasp]

1529
01:41:37,925 --> 01:41:39,885
Okay, I'm waiting
for the punchline.

1530
01:41:41,387 --> 01:41:43,096
There is no punchline.

1531
01:41:44,515 --> 01:41:46,391
- It's not a joke.
- [audience murmuring]

1532
01:41:51,063 --> 01:41:52,147
You're serious, aren't you?

1533
01:41:52,315 --> 01:41:53,375
You're telling us you killed

1534
01:41:53,399 --> 01:41:54,668
those three young men
on the subway?

1535
01:41:54,692 --> 01:41:55,692
[Arthur] Mmm-hmm.

1536
01:41:55,860 --> 01:41:57,569
And why should we believe you?

1537
01:41:57,737 --> 01:41:59,696
I got nothing left to lose.

1538
01:42:01,699 --> 01:42:03,742
Nothing can hurt me anymore.

1539
01:42:05,495 --> 01:42:06,828
[laughs]

1540
01:42:06,913 --> 01:42:09,790
My life is nothing but a comedy.

1541
01:42:10,374 --> 01:42:12,042
[audience booing]

1542
01:42:13,419 --> 01:42:14,521
Well, let me get this straight,

1543
01:42:14,545 --> 01:42:16,797
you think that killing
those guys is funny?

1544
01:42:17,465 --> 01:42:18,965
I do.

1545
01:42:19,133 --> 01:42:21,760
And I'm tired
of pretending it's not.

1546
01:42:21,928 --> 01:42:23,804
Comedy is subjective, Murray.

1547
01:42:24,263 --> 01:42:25,972
Isn't that what they say?

1548
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:27,891
All of you,

1549
01:42:28,059 --> 01:42:30,644
the system that knows so much,

1550
01:42:30,812 --> 01:42:33,522
you decide
what's right or wrong.

1551
01:42:33,689 --> 01:42:38,902
The same way that you decide
what's funny or not!

1552
01:42:40,238 --> 01:42:41,238
[man] Get him off!

1553
01:42:41,989 --> 01:42:45,659
Well, okay,
I think I might understand

1554
01:42:45,993 --> 01:42:47,494
that you did this to
start a movement,

1555
01:42:47,578 --> 01:42:49,579
to become a symbol?

1556
01:42:50,206 --> 01:42:51,748
Come on, Murray.

1557
01:42:51,916 --> 01:42:53,143
Do I look like the kind of clown

1558
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:54,751
that could start a movement?

1559
01:42:54,919 --> 01:42:57,754
I killed those guys
because they were awful.

1560
01:42:57,922 --> 01:43:00,423
Everybody is awful these days.

1561
01:43:00,591 --> 01:43:02,884
It's enough to
make anyone crazy.

1562
01:43:03,052 --> 01:43:04,803
[Murray] Okay. So, that's it,
you're crazy.

1563
01:43:04,971 --> 01:43:07,264
That's your defense
for killing three young men?

1564
01:43:07,890 --> 01:43:09,432
No.

1565
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:12,936
They couldn't carry a tune
to save their lives.

1566
01:43:13,312 --> 01:43:14,521
[audience booing]

1567
01:43:14,772 --> 01:43:18,191
Oh, why is everybody
so upset about these guys?

1568
01:43:19,068 --> 01:43:20,819
If it was me
dying on the sidewalk,

1569
01:43:20,903 --> 01:43:22,279
you'd walk right over me!

1570
01:43:22,446 --> 01:43:24,573
I pass you every day,
and you don't notice me.

1571
01:43:24,740 --> 01:43:26,992
But these guys, what,
because Thomas Wayne

1572
01:43:27,076 --> 01:43:28,618
went and cried about them on TV?

1573
01:43:28,786 --> 01:43:30,829
You have a problem
with Thomas Wayne, too?

1574
01:43:30,997 --> 01:43:32,914
Yes, I do.

1575
01:43:33,082 --> 01:43:36,501
Have you seen what it's like
out there, Murray?

1576
01:43:36,669 --> 01:43:39,713
Do you ever actually
leave the studio?

1577
01:43:39,881 --> 01:43:43,717
Everybody just yells
and screams at each other.

1578
01:43:43,885 --> 01:43:46,052
Nobody's civil anymore.

1579
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:49,806
Nobody thinks what it's like
to be the other guy.

1580
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:53,393
You think men like
Thomas Wayne ever think

1581
01:43:53,477 --> 01:43:55,437
what it's like to be
someone like me?

1582
01:43:55,605 --> 01:43:58,315
To be somebody but themselves?
They don't.

1583
01:43:58,524 --> 01:44:00,650
They think that
we'll just sit there

1584
01:44:00,735 --> 01:44:03,111
and take it,
like good little boys!

1585
01:44:03,404 --> 01:44:05,488
That we won't werewolf
and go wild!

1586
01:44:05,656 --> 01:44:07,282
You finished?

1587
01:44:07,450 --> 01:44:09,784
I mean, it's so much
self-pity, Arthur.

1588
01:44:09,952 --> 01:44:11,494
You sound like
you're making excuses

1589
01:44:11,579 --> 01:44:12,996
for killing those young men.

1590
01:44:13,164 --> 01:44:14,998
Not everybody,
and I'll tell you this,

1591
01:44:15,082 --> 01:44:16,499
not everyone is awful.

1592
01:44:18,794 --> 01:44:20,003
You're awful, Murray.

1593
01:44:20,171 --> 01:44:22,047
Me? I'm awful?

1594
01:44:22,214 --> 01:44:23,965
Oh, yeah, how am I awful?

1595
01:44:26,135 --> 01:44:27,594
Playing my video.

1596
01:44:29,013 --> 01:44:30,889
Inviting me on this show.

1597
01:44:31,974 --> 01:44:34,309
You just wanted to
make fun of me.

1598
01:44:35,311 --> 01:44:37,270
You're just like
the rest of them.

1599
