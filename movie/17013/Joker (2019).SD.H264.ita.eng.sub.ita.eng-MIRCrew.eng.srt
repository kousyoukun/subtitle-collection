1
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:10,070
The news never ends.

2
00:00:10,094 --> 00:00:12,011
This is 1080 gcr.

3
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,139
You get all the news you need,
all day long.

4
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:16,933
Good morning.

5
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:20,228
It's 42 degrees at 10:30 on
this Thursday, October 15th.

6
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:22,730
I'm Stan I. Brooks,
and here's what's happening.

7
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:25,108
It's day 18
of the garbage strike,

8
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,902
with 10,000 tons of garbage
piling up every day.

9
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,029
Even the nicest sections
of the city

10
00:00:30,114 --> 00:00:31,447
are looking like slums.

11
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:33,324
Health commissioner
Edward o'Rourke is

12
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:35,118
declaring a city-wide
state of emergency

13
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:36,911
for the first time in decades.

14
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,199
There's no need to
wait until somebody dies

15
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:40,915
or comes down
with typhoid fever.

16
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,084
It's already
a serious situation.

17
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:44,354
It's something that affects

18
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,498
almost everyone in the city,

19
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,672
no matter who they are
or where they live.

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,049
You can't go down
no one Avenue

21
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:52,135
without seeing nothing
but garbage and rats.

22
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,530
It's starting to
affect my business

23
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:54,823
when customers can't get in here

24
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:56,639
because of
the garbage situation.

25
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,535
I'm not out that long
to smell it,

26
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,393
but I think to look at it,
it's terrible.

27
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,019
It don't affect me except

28
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:03,730
for the very bad smell here.

29
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:04,897
It's horrific.

30
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,274
It's a mess.

31
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:07,752
I've been in this country
for 50 years,

32
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,216
and I've never seen
anything like it.

33
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:10,820
What is this world coming to?

34
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,071
Put 'em in a room,

35
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:13,717
let 'em sit there and talk
until they get it over with.

36
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,950
24 hours, 48 hours,
how long it takes.

37
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,411
The idea of
the national guard moving in

38
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,954
and cleaning up is a good idea.

39
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:21,242
In other news,

40
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,890
the building industry
and landlords today

41
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,459
expressed concern
over the latest

42
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,335
increase in heating oil prices.

43
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,712
Renters in the Metro area

44
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,213
are certain to feel the pinch...

45
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:05,894
Yo, what's up
with your shoes, bro?

46
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:06,918
Nice outfit, pal.

47
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,354
If you're gonna be
a clown, at least you could be

48
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,004
a good one.
You know that, right?

49
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:12,317
- Hey! Hey!
- Grab it!

50
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:13,341
Go, go, go!

51
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:14,675
Hey!

52
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:16,052
He's coming!

53
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,721
Come on, clown, let's go!
We've got the sign.

54
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:20,450
- Look at him running.
- Let's go!

55
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,474
Stop them!

56
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,495
Go, go, go, go!
Watch the car, watch the car!

57
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,216
Where's your sign,
clown?

58
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,232
Hey!

59
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,071
Go, clown! Come on!

60
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:36,322
Stop them!

61
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:39,617
Go! Come on!

62
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,287
Stop them!

63
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:45,081
Come on, run!

64
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:48,584
Hey!

65
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,337
You fucking...

66
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:57,927
Oh, shit! Good hit.

67
00:02:58,095 --> 00:02:59,846
Come on!
Beat his ass up.

68
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,813
Come on! This guy's weak.
He can't do nothing.

69
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,850
Harder! Harder!

70
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,268
Beat him up. Take his stuff.

71
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,687
Let's go, let's go!
Come on. Let's go!

72
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,160
Ha!

73
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,250
Is it just me,

74
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,921
or is it getting crazier
out there?

75
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:03,344
- It is certainly tense.
- Hmm.

76
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,721
People are upset.

77
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,766
They're struggling.
Looking for work.

78
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:10,309
These are tough times.

79
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,730
How about you?

80
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,442
Have you been keeping up
with your journal?

81
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:21,988
Yes, ma'am.

82
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:24,907
Great.

83
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,368
Did you bring it with you?

84
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:33,040
Arthur.

85
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,543
Last time, I asked you
to bring your journal

86
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,294
with you for these appointments.

87
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,338
Can I see it?

88
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:54,186
I've been using it as a journal,

89
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,732
but also as a joke diary.

90
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:02,236
Funny thoughts or observations.

91
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,530
I think I told you

92
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,783
I'm pursuing a career
in stand-up comedy.

93
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,830
No, you didn't.

94
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,292
I think I did.

95
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:28,763
"I just hope my death makes
more sense than my life."

96
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,114
How does it feel to
have to come here?

97
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,284
Does it help to
have someone to talk to?

98
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,581
I think I felt better

99
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,666
when I was locked up
in the hospital.

100
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:00,961
And have you thought more about

101
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,714
why you were locked up?

102
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,222
Who knows?

103
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,147
I was wondering
if you could ask the doctor

104
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:22,149
to increase my medication.

105
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,491
Arthur, you're on
seven different medications.

106
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:34,411
Surely,
they must be doing something.

107
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:40,126
I just don't want to
feel so bad anymore.

108
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,372
Would you please
stop bothering my kid?

109
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:22,603
I wasn't bothering him.
I was...

110
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,836
Just stop.

111
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:34,180
What? You think that's funny?

112
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,106
I'm sorry. I have a...

113
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:01,907
I'm sorry.

114
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,080
Happy,
did you check the mail

115
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,475
before you came up?

116
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,227
Yeah, mom.

117
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,688
Nothing.

118
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,461
And finally, tonight,

119
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,486
just when you thought
it couldn't get any worse,

120
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:55,946
authorities are saying

121
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,490
the city is under siege
by scores of rats.

122
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,950
And not just any rats,

123
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:02,161
but super rats,
who are hard to kill.

124
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,246
He must not be
getting my letters.

125
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,414
Yeah.

126
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,666
It's Thomas Wayne, mom.

127
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,251
He's a busy man.

128
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:13,130
Please. I worked
for that family for years.

129
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,591
The least he could do
is write back.

130
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:20,304
Here.
Don't get all worked up. Eat.

131
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:21,472
You need to eat.

132
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:25,267
You need to eat.
Look how skinny you are.

133
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,497
Both victims
were taken to Gotham general.

134
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,646
Sounds like

135
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:30,875
the city needs to
find the pied Piper.

136
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,567
He'll make a great mayor.
Everybody says so.

137
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,529
Oh, yeah. Everybody who?
Who do you talk to?

138
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,491
Well, everybody on the news.

139
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,826
He's the only one
who could save the city.

140
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,328
He owes it to us.

141
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,749
Come sit. It's starting.

142
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,709
Yay, Murray.

143
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:55,005
From
ncb studios in Gotham city,

144
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:58,467
it's live with Murray Franklin!

145
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:02,554
Tonight, Murray welcomes
Sandra winger...

146
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:03,931
Oh, Sandra winger's on.

147
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:07,226
And the piano stylings
of yeldon and Chantel.

148
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,520
Joining Murray, as always,

149
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:12,272
Ellis drane
and his jazz orchestra.

150
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,109
And now, without further ado,

151
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,028
Murray Franklin.

152
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,167
Thank you.

153
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,461
Thank you.

154
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,964
We got a great-looking
audience tonight.

155
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,258
Yeah!

156
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,135
Wow. Thank you. Thank you.

157
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:42,636
Thank you.

158
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,722
So, everybody's heard
about the super rats that

159
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,225
- are in Gotham now, right?
- Yeah.

160
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,687
Well, today, the mayor said
he has a solution.

161
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:53,397
You ready for this?

162
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:54,648
Super cats.

163
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:00,798
But in all seriousness,
I mean, these rats are...

164
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,322
I love you, Murray!

165
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,492
I love you, too.

166
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,996
Hey, Bobby,
would you put the lights on?

167
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,164
Who is that?

168
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,499
Was that you?
You wanna stand up, please?

169
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,585
Stand up for me.

170
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:15,752
Go ahead.

171
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,634
What's your name?

172
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:25,179
Hi, Murray. Arthur.

173
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,014
- Arthur?
- My name's Arthur.

174
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:28,909
Oh, okay. Well, there's
something special about you,

175
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:29,975
Arthur, I could tell.

176
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,143
Where are you from?

177
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,020
I live right here in the city

178
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:35,148
with my mother.

179
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,418
Okay, hold on.
Hold on.

180
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:38,586
There's nothing funny
about that.

181
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,278
I lived with my mother before
I made it. Just me and her.

182
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:44,281
I'm that kid whose father went
out for a pack of cigarettes,

183
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:45,449
and he never came back.

184
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,575
Aww.

185
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,660
I know
what that's like, Murray.

186
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,371
I've been the man of the house
for as long as I can remember.

187
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,290
I take good care of my mother.

188
00:13:57,462 --> 00:14:00,380
All that sacrifice,
she must love you very much.

189
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,548
She does.

190
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:06,261
She always tells me to smile
and put on a happy face.

191
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:09,056
She says I was put here
to spread joy and laughter.

192
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,599
Aww.

193
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:13,977
Wow.

194
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:19,483
I like that. I like that
a lot. Come on down.

195
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:22,486
Come on. For that,
you gotta come down.

196
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:24,131
Come on! Come on.

197
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,038
Come on.

198
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:50,514
Okay, we got a big show
tonight. Stay tuned.

199
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,474
We'll be right back.

200
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,643
That was great, Arthur.
Thank you.

201
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,562
I mean, I loved hearing
what you had to say.

202
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,938
It made my day.

203
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,314
Thanks, Murray.

204
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,400
You see all this,
the lights, the show,

205
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:02,776
the audience, all that stuff?

206
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,171
I'd give it all up
in a heartbeat

207
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,362
to have a kid like you.

208
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,967
- What's up, ladies?
- Hey, Randall. What's up?

209
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,658
Another day in chuckle town.

210
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:52,826
Yup.

211
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,456
You okay?

212
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,918
I heard about
the beatdown you took.

213
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,754
Fucking savages.

214
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,716
It was just a bunch of kids.
I should have left it alone.

215
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,842
No.

216
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,345
They'll take everything
from you if you do that.

217
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,846
All the crazy shit out there.

218
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,098
They're animals.

219
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:20,896
You know what?

220
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,152
Here.

221
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,072
What is it?

222
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,615
Take it.

223
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,617
It's for you.

224
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:40,040
You gotta
protect yourself out there.

225
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,292
Otherwise,
you're gonna get fucked.

226
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,087
Randall,

227
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:49,174
I'm not supposed to have a gun.

228
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,177
Don't sweat it, art.

229
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,221
No one has to know.

230
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,723
And you can pay me back
some other time.

231
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,100
You know you're my boy.

232
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:01,311
Arthur,

233
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,438
hoyt wants to
see you in his office.

234
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,692
Hey, Gary. You know
what I've always wondered?

235
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,984
No idea.

236
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,986
Do you people call it
miniature golf

237
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,530
or is it just golf to you?

238
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,286
Punch him in the dick,
Gary.

239
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:36,888
Hello, hoyt.

240
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,558
Gary said you wanted to see me.

241
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:42,644
How's the comedy career?
Are you a famous stand-up yet?

242
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:43,770
Not quite.

243
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,064
Just been
working on my material.

244
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,150
No, don't sit.
This'll be quick.

245
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,818
Look, I like you, Arthur.

246
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,403
You know, a lot of the guys,

247
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,127
they think you're a freak,
but I like you.

248
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,657
I don't even know
why I like you.

249
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:57,951
But I got another complaint.

250
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:01,455
It's starting to piss me off.
Kenny's music.

251
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,457
The guy said you disappeared.

252
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,000
Never even returned his sign.

253
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:07,669
Because I got jumped.

254
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,755
Didn't you hear?

255
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,673
For a sign?

256
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:14,009
That's bullshit.
It doesn't even make sense.

257
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:16,136
Just get him his sign back.

258
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,680
He's going out of business,
for god's sake, Arthur.

259
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,640
Why would I keep his sign?

260
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,560
How the fuck do I know?
Why does anybody do anything?

261
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,855
If you don't return the sign,

262
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,065
I gotta take it
out of your paycheck.

263
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,276
Are we clear?

264
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,572
Listen, I'm trying to help you.

265
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,699
Okay? And I'll tell you
something else.

266
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,242
The other guys,

267
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,167
they don't feel comfortable
around you, Arthur,

268
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,205
because people
think you're weird.

269
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,208
Okay? And I can't
have that around me.

270
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,050
Wait, wait, wait.

271
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:38,218
Wait.

272
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:42,597
Thank you.

273
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,205
This building is so awful,
isn't it?

274
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,543
This building is so awful,
right, mommy?

275
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,129
Yes, we can hear you, gigi.

276
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:16,631
It's so awful, mommy.

277
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,342
Right, mommy?

278
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,810
- Good night.
- This building's

279
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,163
- so awful, isn't it?
- Mmm-hmm.

280
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,651
Hey.

281
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,367
Come on.

282
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:57,964
The moon is a silver dollar

283
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,051
shining up in the sky

284
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,678
that's the dream we can buy...

285
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,083
- Look up.
- Mmm.

286
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,223
Maybe the mailman's
throwing them away.

287
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,268
Mom, why are these letters
so important to you?

288
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,467
What do you think he's gonna do?

289
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:13,897
He's gonna help us.

290
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:18,985
But you worked for him,
what, 30 years ago?

291
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:21,029
Why would he help us?

292
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,782
Because Thomas Wayne
is a good man.

293
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:27,243
If he knew how we were living,

294
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:30,872
if he saw this place,
it would make him sick.

295
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,918
I can't explain it to you
any better than that.

296
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,672
I don't want you worrying
about money, mom.

297
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,132
Or me.

298
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:42,759
Everybody's telling me

299
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,470
that my stand-up's
ready for the big clubs.

300
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:49,265
But, happy, what makes you
think you could do that?

301
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,476
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

302
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,938
Don't you have to be funny
to be a comedian?

303
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,761
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom

304
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,180
the world is in a mess

305
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,558
with politics and taxes
and people grinding axes

306
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:32,809
there's no happiness

307
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,354
happiness is not a riddle

308
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:39,232
when I'm listening to that
big bass fiddle

309
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,579
Slap that bass
slap it till its dizzy

310
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:54,998
slap that bass
keep the rhythm busy

311
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,876
zoom, zoom, zoom
misery, you've got to go...

312
00:22:58,586 --> 00:22:59,836
Hey, what's your name?

313
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:02,047
Arthur.

314
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:06,301
Hey, Arthur,
you're a really good dancer.

315
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:08,136
I know.

316
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,930
You know who's not?
Him.

317
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,480
Happy, what was that?
Are you okay?

318
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,689
Mom, what?

319
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:21,983
That noise!
Did you hear that noise?

320
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:24,402
I'm watching an old war movie!

321
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,071
Turn it down!

322
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:27,572
Um...

323
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,120
Sorry, mom.

324
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:47,967
You good?

325
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,871
It's nice to see these couples
out at my show.

326
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:01,040
I have a wife.
We love to role-play.

327
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,835
- Ooh!
- Yes, yes, very sexy.

328
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,503
My favorite one right now is

329
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:08,631
professor and senior
who really needs

330
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,049
to pass my class to graduate.

331
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,468
Yes.

332
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,305
So, I'll tell you how I operate.

333
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,598
I'm a professor at

334
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,201
a prestigious
new england university...

335
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:23,605
And my wife is a senior
in my "intro to western civ."

336
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:26,816
I know. I know.

337
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:30,153
Why is she a senior in the
intro? I didn't buy it either.

338
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,114
So, she comes to me
during my office hours.

339
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:35,883
It's Monday and Wednesday,
three to five.

340
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:38,244
She says,
"excuse me, professor Lewis."

341
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:40,330
I can't use my real last name
at this college

342
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,040
'cause they don't hire Jews.

343
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,126
It's something I'll address

344
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:46,836
once I have tenure,
but for now...

345
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,172
She says,
"excuse me, professor Lewis,

346
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,567
I think I might be
in danger of failing

347
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:51,799
your 'intro to western civ, '

348
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,092
and I just want you to know

349
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:54,928
I'm willing to do
anything to pass."

350
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:59,140
And I said, "anything?"
And she said...

351
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,917
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

352
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,461
Were you following me today?

353
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:15,758
Yeah.

354
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,470
I thought that was you.

355
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:22,724
I was hoping you'd come in
and Rob the place.

356
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,311
I have a gun.

357
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,104
I could come by tomorrow.

358
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,026
You're so funny, Arthur.

359
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,571
Yeah.

360
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:39,240
You know, I do stand-up comedy.

361
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:42,160
You should maybe
come see a show sometime.

362
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,203
I could do that.

363
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,496
Yeah?

364
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,457
Yeah. You'll let me know when?

365
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:48,624
Yeah.

366
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,759
If you're happy
and you know it

367
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:59,010
wiggle your ears

368
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,094
wiggle your ears

369
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:02,388
if you're happy
and you know it

370
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:04,724
wiggle your ears

371
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:07,143
if you're happy and you know it

372
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,312
and you really want to show it

373
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,481
if you're happy and you know it

374
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:12,690
wiggle your ears

375
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,069
if you're happy and you know it

376
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:18,613
stomp your feet

377
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,698
if you're happy and you know it

378
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:23,076
stomp your feet

379
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,453
if you're happy and you know it

380
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,663
and you really want to show it

381
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,957
if you're happy and you know it

382
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,292
stomp your feet

383
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,170
if you're happy and you know it

384
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,671
shout "hurray"

385
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,006
shout "hurray"

386
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:39,092
if you're happy and you know it

387
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,593
shout "hurray"

388
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:41,821
shout "hurray"

389
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,304
if you're happy and you know it

390
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:45,069
and you really want to

391
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:49,185
hoyt, please, I love this job.

392
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:51,562
Arthur, I need to know why

393
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,773
you brought a gun
into a kids' hospital.

394
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:56,901
It's a prop.
It's part of my act now.

395
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,903
That's bullshit. Bullshit.

396
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,155
What kind of clown
carries a fucking gun?

397
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,282
Besides, Randall told me

398
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:06,327
you tried to buy a .38
off him last week.

399
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:07,537
Randall told you that?

400
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:10,832
You're a fuck-up, Arthur,
and a liar.

401
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,079
You're fired!

402
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:39,462
Jefferson street.

403
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:40,987
Next stop, ninth ave.

404
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:45,427
I'm telling you,
she wanted my number.

405
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:46,576
We should've just stayed.

406
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:49,412
You're dreaming, man.
She wasn't interested at all.

407
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,933
Are you nuts? Did you
see how close we were dancing?

408
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,040
She was in love.

409
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,728
She couldn't wait to
get away from you.

410
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:57,170
Ryan! Ryan, am I crazy?
Tell him what you saw.

411
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,836
Hey,
you want some French fries?

412
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:05,887
Hello?

413
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:08,347
Talking to you. Hey.

414
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,057
No, thank you.

415
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,270
You sure?

416
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:17,273
They're real good.

417
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,862
Don't ignore him.
He's being nice to you.

418
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:25,239
Whoo...

419
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,474
Is something funny, asshole?

420
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,063
Bitch!

421
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,822
Isn't it rich?

422
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,117
Are we a pair?

423
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:15,248
Me here at last on the ground

424
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:18,417
and you in mid-air

425
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:21,587
send in the clowns

426
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,510
isn't it bliss?

427
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:30,972
Don't you approve?

428
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:34,141
One who keeps tearing around

429
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:37,144
and one who can't move

430
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:40,481
where are the clowns?

431
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:44,360
There ought to be clowns

432
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:57,039
So, buddy, tell us,
what's so fucking funny?

433
00:31:57,207 --> 00:31:58,833
Nothing.

434
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,171
I have... I have a condition.

435
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,841
I'll tell you what you have,
you asshole.

436
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,050
Whoa!

437
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:11,929
Please, stop!

438
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,932
We got a kicker, huh?

439
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,892
Hey, hold him steady.
Hold him steady.

440
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,063
Stay down, freak!

441
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,459
Hey!

442
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,084
Ninth Avenue.

443
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,275
Next stop, hunter's point.

444
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:07,777
Hey!

445
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:15,660
Stand clear of
the closing doors.

446
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:55,199
Shit. Shit.

447
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,666
I read it was
a guy in full makeup.

448
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:53,294
No, it says right here
it was a mask.

449
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,588
Either way, I think
it's good for business.

450
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:58,090
They got clowns on the front
of every newspaper.

451
00:36:58,258 --> 00:36:59,466
Big man, what's the good word?

452
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:00,634
Hey.

453
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,973
Hey, Arthur,
I heard what happened.

454
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:07,433
Sorry, mate.

455
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:08,601
Yeah.

456
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:10,519
It doesn't seem fair,

457
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:12,563
getting fired like that.

458
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:14,857
Did you really bring a gun

459
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,358
to the children's hospital,
Artie?

460
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:18,903
What the fuck
would you do that for?

461
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,506
Is that part of
your new act, Arthur?

462
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:21,632
If your dancing
doesn't do the trick,

463
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:22,925
you're just gonna
shoot yourself?

464
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:25,701
Why don't you
ask Randall about it?

465
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:27,828
It was his gun.

466
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:29,849
- What?
- I still owe you for that,

467
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:30,915
don't I?

468
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,833
What the fuck
are you talking about?

469
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,169
Stop talking
out of your ass, art.

470
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,675
Oh, no!

471
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,137
I forgot to punch out.

472
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,604
And turns to sorrow

473
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,984
king of all hear me call

474
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:04,698
hear my name carnival

475
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,711
And as our city
tries to make sense

476
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:21,340
of the brutal triple murder
on the subway last week,

477
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:23,008
we're joined by Thomas Wayne.

478
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:25,427
Happy, look,
Thomas Wayne's on TV.

479
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:26,762
Yes, mother.

480
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,324
Thanks for
having me on, Chuck.

481
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:29,640
They're asking him about

482
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,183
those horrible subway murders.

483
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:32,631
Thank you, Thomas.
I know

484
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:34,436
this is a difficult time
for you.

485
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:36,271
Why him?

486
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,315
Looks like he's gained weight.

487
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,563
Yes, all three worked
for Wayne investments.

488
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,569
Good, decent, educated.

489
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,364
Although I didn't know
any of them personally.

490
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:48,492
Like all Wayne employees,

491
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,869
past and present,
they're family.

492
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,757
Did you hear that?
I told you, we're family.

493
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:54,266
There now seems to be

494
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,542
a groundswell of anti-rich
sentiment in the city.

495
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,877
It's almost as if
our less fortunate residents

496
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:01,171
are taking the side
of the killer.

497
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,007
Yes, and it's a shame.

498
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,466
It's one of the reasons why

499
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:05,831
I'm considering a run for mayor.

500
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,846
Gotham's lost its way.

501
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:10,764
What about the eyewitness report

502
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:13,559
of the suspect being
a man in a clown mask?

503
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:15,728
Well,
it makes total sense to me.

504
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,135
What kind of coward would do
something that cold-blooded?

505
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:20,107
Someone who hides behind a mask.

506
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,151
Someone who is envious

507
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:25,654
of those more fortunate
than themselves,

508
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,158
yet they're too scared
to show their own face.

509
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:32,244
And until those kind of people
change for the better,

510
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:35,998
those of us who have
made something of our lives

511
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:38,500
will always look
at those who haven't

512
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:40,794
as nothing but clowns.

513
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:44,882
Thomas Wayne, thank you
for coming in this morning.

514
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,050
It's not funny.

515
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:10,032
I heard this song on the radio
the other day,

516
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:16,872
and the guy was singing
that his name was carnival.

517
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:19,124
Arthur...

518
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:20,459
Which is crazy,

519
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,881
because that's
my clown name at work.

520
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:29,426
And until a little while ago,

521
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,180
it was like nobody ever saw me.

522
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:37,601
Even I didn't know
if I really existed.

523
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:40,395
Arthur, I have
some bad news for you.

524
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:45,150
You don't listen, do you?

525
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:50,823
I don't think
you ever really hear me.

526
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:54,701
You just ask
the same questions every week.

527
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:58,163
"How's your job? Are you
having any negative thoughts?"

528
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:02,918
All I have are
negative thoughts,

529
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:05,921
but you don't listen anyway.

530
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:09,466
I said, for my whole life,

531
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:12,845
I didn't know
if I even really existed.

532
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,764
But I do.

533
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:21,145
And people are
starting to notice.

534
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,648
They've cut our funding.

535
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:26,483
We're closing down
our offices next week.

536
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,112
The city has cut funding
across the board.

537
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,156
Social services is part of that.

538
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,366
This is the last time
we'll be meeting.

539
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,493
Okay.

540
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:42,787
They don't give a shit
about people like you, Arthur.

541
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:46,378
And they really
don't give a shit

542
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,422
about people like me, either.

543
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,010
Fuck.

544
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:03,729
How am I supposed to
get my medication now?

545
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:08,317
Who do I talk to?

546
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,571
I'm sorry, Arthur.

547
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,911
I think... I think most women
look at sex like buying a car.

548
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:21,997
You know, like, "can I see
myself in this long-term?"

549
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:24,166
"Is it safe?"

550
00:42:24,334 --> 00:42:25,792
"Is it reliable?"

551
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,212
"Could it kill me?"

552
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:30,339
Most guys, we look at sex
like parking a car.

553
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,883
We're like, "there's a spot."

554
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,176
"There's another spot.

555
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,487
"That would work."

556
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:38,013
"Oh, I have to pay?
Never mind."

557
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:42,434
"Handicapped?
I hope no one sees this."

558
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:47,356
All right, that's my time.
Thank you very much, guys.

559
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,696
One more time
for Sam morril, y'all.

560
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,783
All right, now,
this next comic describes

561
00:42:57,867 --> 00:42:59,993
himself as
a lifelong Gotham resident

562
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:02,537
who from a young age
was always told

563
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:03,664
that his purpose in life

564
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:07,834
was to bring laughter and joy
into this cold, dark world.

565
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,779
Um... okay.

566
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:12,172
Please help me welcome
Arthur fleck, y'all.

567
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:13,298
Arthur fleck.

568
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,158
Hello, it's good to be here.

569
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:07,894
I hated school when I was a kid.

570
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:28,206
I hated school as a kid.

571
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,168
My mother would say,

572
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:32,836
"you should enjoy it.

573
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,963
One day, you'll have to
work for a living."

574
00:44:36,424 --> 00:44:37,674
"No, I won't, ma,

575
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,426
I'm gonna be a comedian."

576
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:49,853
Um...

577
00:44:52,065 --> 00:44:53,190
Here's one.

578
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:57,527
You know, I was
just thinking the other day,

579
00:44:57,612 --> 00:44:59,571
why are the rich people...

580
00:45:06,162 --> 00:45:07,556
Smile though your heart is aching

581
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:15,295
smile even though it's breaking

582
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:23,345
when there are clouds in the sky
you'll get by

583
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:28,892
if you smile
through your fear and sorrow

584
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:34,022
smile and maybe tomorrow

585
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:39,986
you'll see the sun
come shining through for you

586
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:41,405
you believe that shit?

587
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:44,241
Fuck 'em.

588
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:48,912
I think the guy
that did it is a hero.

589
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:52,916
Three less pricks
in Gotham city,

590
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:55,293
only a million more to go.

591
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:59,798
You'll get by

592
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:04,136
that's the time you must keep on trying

593
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,890
smile, what's the use of crying

594
00:46:09,058 --> 00:46:13,520
you'll find that
life is still worthwhile

595
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:19,651
if you just smile

596
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,595
And, buddy, as always,

597
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,744
thanks for the laughs.

598
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:31,413
I'm sure we'll see you again.

599
00:46:31,581 --> 00:46:32,789
You know we'll be here, right?

600
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:34,166
I hope.

601
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:37,919
Tomorrow night, we have
Diana Hudson, Greg Gordon,

602
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:40,881
and animal expert, Hugh little.

603
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:42,841
Thanks for watching.

604
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:45,302
Good night, and always remember,

605
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:46,947
that's life.

606
00:46:51,184 --> 00:46:52,350
That's life.

607
00:46:57,190 --> 00:47:00,567
Momma, time to wake up
and go to bed.

608
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:01,776
Hmm? Oh...

609
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,489
Oh, happy.

610
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:09,993
Happy, I wrote a new letter.

611
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:11,870
Come on, dance with me.

612
00:47:12,872 --> 00:47:15,248
For Thomas Wayne.
It's important.

613
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:25,884
You smell like Cologne.

614
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:28,512
It's 'cause
I just had a big date.

615
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,472
Oh.

616
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:34,935
Just don't forget to mail it.

617
00:48:00,753 --> 00:48:02,481
The Murray Franklin
show is taped live

618
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:03,880
before a studio audience

619
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:06,174
in beautiful downtown
Gotham city.

620
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:11,114
You're gonna kill me. You're
gonna give me a heart attack!

621
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:12,449
Don't give me your...

622
00:49:12,617 --> 00:49:14,451
No. No.

623
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:17,579
I'm not talking to you
until you stop being angry!

624
00:49:17,747 --> 00:49:20,165
Okay.

625
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:27,005
I'm not angry, mom.

626
00:49:27,173 --> 00:49:29,507
I'm not angry.

627
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:30,884
Please.

628
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:34,679
Mom, is this real?

629
00:49:38,351 --> 00:49:41,561
He's an extraordinary man,
happy.

630
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:44,064
He's a very powerful man.

631
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:47,567
We were in love.

632
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:50,362
He said it was best that
we not be together

633
00:49:50,446 --> 00:49:52,572
because of appearances.

634
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:58,411
And I could never
tell anyone because...

635
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,415
Well, I signed some papers.

636
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:05,877
And besides, you can imagine

637
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:09,339
what people would say
about Thomas and me.

638
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:13,426
What they'd say about you.

639
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,557
What would they say, mom?

640
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:09,709
Hmm.

641
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:21,679
Hmm.

642
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:53,837
Hi.

643
00:52:56,799 --> 00:52:58,174
What's your name?

644
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,052
I'm Bruce.

645
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,304
Bruce.

646
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:06,516
I'm Arthur.

647
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:29,873
That's better.

648
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:32,375
Bruce! Bruce!

649
00:53:33,878 --> 00:53:35,044
Get away from that man.

650
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,338
It's okay. I'm a good guy.

651
00:53:37,506 --> 00:53:38,756
What are you doing?
Who are you?

652
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:41,050
I'm here to see Mr. Wayne.

653
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:43,720
Well, you shouldn't be
speaking to his son.

654
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:46,449
Why did you give him
these flowers?

655
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:47,682
No, they're not real.

656
00:53:49,435 --> 00:53:51,477
It's magic.

657
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:53,354
I was just trying to
make him smile.

658
00:53:53,522 --> 00:53:55,356
Well, it's not funny, is it?

659
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:57,567
Do I need to call the police?

660
00:53:57,735 --> 00:53:59,152
No. Please.

661
00:54:00,446 --> 00:54:03,656
My mother's name is penny.
Penny fleck.

662
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:05,051
She used to work here years ago.

663
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,160
Can you please tell Mr. Wayne
I need to see him?

664
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:09,787
You are her son.

665
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:10,955
Yeah.

666
00:54:11,624 --> 00:54:13,333
Did you know her?

667
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:19,297
I know about the two of them.

668
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:22,300
She told me everything.

669
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:25,970
There's nothing to know.

670
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,890
There is no "them."

671
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:32,018
Your mother was delusional.

672
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:34,020
She was a sick woman.

673
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:36,230
Don't say that.

674
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:38,816
Just go.

675
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:39,943
Mmm?

676
00:54:40,069 --> 00:54:42,320
Before you
make a fool of yourself.

677
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:46,658
Thomas Wayne is my father.

678
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:52,705
He left me.

679
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:56,902
Let go! Let go!

680
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:25,029
Keep the respirations above 15.

681
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:27,365
Slow and steady.
We got some stairs coming up.

682
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:29,826
Mom?

683
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:31,661
What happened?

684
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,496
- Who are you?
- I'm her son.

685
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,141
- What happened?
- You can probably help us out inside.

686
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:36,582
We don't know what happened yet.

687
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:38,645
- Hop in the back of the ambulance.
- Step.

688
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:39,980
One more.
We got one more lift.

689
00:55:40,004 --> 00:55:41,045
I'm getting

690
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:42,357
a little resistance here,
Michael.

691
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,050
Lift.

692
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:52,932
I'm right here.

693
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:54,517
Excuse me, sir.

694
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:55,870
Does your mother take
any medications?

695
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:56,978
- No.
- Excuse me,

696
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:58,142
- I couldn't hear you.
- No.

697
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,833
Sir, when was the last time
you spoke to her?

698
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:01,024
I don't know.

699
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:47,153
Mr. Fleck.

700
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,490
Sorry to bother you.
I'm detective garrity.

701
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:52,867
This is my partner,
detective Burke.

702
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:55,953
We had a few questions for
you, but you weren't home,

703
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:58,956
so we spoke with your mother.

704
00:57:00,709 --> 00:57:01,709
Oh.

705
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:04,295
What did you say to her?

706
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:05,463
Did you do this?

707
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:06,631
What? No.

708
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:09,258
No, no, no. We just
asked her some questions,

709
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:10,927
and she got hysterical.

710
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:12,845
Hyperventilating,

711
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:14,282
collapsed and
hit her head pretty hard.

712
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:16,432
Yeah. The doctor said
she had a stroke.

713
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:18,893
We're sorry to hear about that.

714
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:22,605
But, like I said, I still have
some questions for you.

715
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:24,053
They're about
the subway killings

716
00:57:24,108 --> 00:57:25,149
that happened last week.

717
00:57:25,317 --> 00:57:26,609
You've heard about them, right?

718
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:27,860
Yeah.

719
00:57:28,028 --> 00:57:29,028
It's horrible.

720
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:30,404
Right.

721
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:34,492
So, we spoke with your boss
over at haha's.

722
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,702
He said you were fired
for bringing a gun

723
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:38,246
into the children's hospital.

724
00:57:39,748 --> 00:57:41,749
- Is that true, Mr. Fleck?
- It was a prop.

725
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:43,459
It's part of my act.

726
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:45,211
I'm a party clown.

727
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:47,296
All right.
So, why were you fired?

728
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:53,136
They said I wasn't funny enough.

729
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:55,263
Can you imagine that?

730
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:59,267
If you don't mind, I have to
go take care of my mother.

731
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:01,686
Your boss also
gave us one of your cards.

732
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:06,232
This condition of yours,
the laughing,

733
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:08,317
is it real,

734
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,319
or some sort of clown thing?

735
00:58:10,863 --> 00:58:13,364
- A clown thing?
- Yeah.

736
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:16,075
I mean, is it part of your act?

737
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:19,996
What do you think?

738
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,003
It's exit only.

739
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:53,487
She's gonna be okay.

740
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,660
I'm gonna get a coffee.

741
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,370
You want one?

742
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:02,538
Yeah.

743
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:18,638
So, the other night,
I told my youngest son Billy,

744
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:21,265
you know, the new one,
the not-so-bright one.

745
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,601
I told him, "the garbage strike

746
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:24,936
is still going on, Billy."

747
00:59:25,145 --> 00:59:27,188
And he says, and I'm
not kidding, Billy says,

748
00:59:27,356 --> 00:59:29,316
"so, where are we gonna get
all our garbage from?"

749
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:39,158
And finally,
in a world where everyone

750
00:59:39,243 --> 00:59:40,576
thinks they could do my job,

751
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:42,954
we got this video tape
from pogo's comedy club,

752
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:44,163
right here in Gotham.

753
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:46,291
Here's a guy who thinks
if you just keep laughing,

754
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,125
it'll somehow make you funny.

755
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:49,543
Check out this joker.

756
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,342
Oh, my god.

757
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:59,971
I hated school as a kid.

758
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:03,891
But my mother would always say,

759
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:05,643
"you should enjoy it.

760
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:07,853
One day, you'll have to
work for a living."

761
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:10,064
"No, I won't, ma.

762
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:11,857
I'm gonna be a comedian."

763
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:20,283
You shoulda listened
to your mother.

764
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:24,120
Hey, one more.
One more, Bobby.

765
01:00:24,288 --> 01:00:26,706
All right, let's see one more.
I love this guy.

766
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:28,541
It's funny,

767
01:00:29,418 --> 01:00:31,544
when I was a little boy

768
01:00:31,712 --> 01:00:34,547
and told people
I was gonna be a comedian,

769
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:36,757
everyone laughed at me.

770
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:39,719
Well, no one's laughing now.

771
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:45,099
You can say that again, pal.

772
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:53,733
All right, we got a great show
for you tonight.

773
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:57,069
Chuck conby is here,
actress joanne mulligan,

774
01:00:57,237 --> 01:01:01,073
and new music from
Mel rubin and the stiffs.

775
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:09,582
As tensions mount
around the Metro area,

776
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:13,336
mayor Stokes has pleaded
for cooler heads to prevail.

777
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:15,087
City services
have been affected,

778
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:17,256
and some businesses have decided

779
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:20,134
to remain closed
amid the unrest.

780
01:01:20,302 --> 01:01:22,887
Chuck Stevens filed this report.

781
01:01:23,055 --> 01:01:24,282
The anger and resentment

782
01:01:24,306 --> 01:01:25,742
that's been building
in the city for weeks

783
01:01:25,766 --> 01:01:27,767
seems close to exploding.

784
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:29,977
Protesters,
many dressed as clowns,

785
01:01:30,062 --> 01:01:31,187
took to the streets today

786
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:33,189
in one of
several planned demonstrations

787
01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:34,815
taking on the city's elite,

788
01:01:34,983 --> 01:01:36,734
including a massive rally
outside

789
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:39,236
tomorrow night's
benefit at Wayne hall.

790
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:41,049
What's the point of all this?

791
01:01:41,073 --> 01:01:42,907
- The rich.
- Thomas Wayne.

792
01:01:42,991 --> 01:01:44,677
That's what this whole
thing is about.

793
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,577
The whole system.

794
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:47,889
Wayne,
who recently announced

795
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:49,121
he is running for mayor,

796
01:01:49,289 --> 01:01:50,998
will be attending the benefit.

797
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:53,167
You might remember
it was Thomas Wayne

798
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:54,710
who first referred to

799
01:01:54,795 --> 01:01:57,588
many of Gotham's residents
as "clowns."

800
01:01:57,756 --> 01:02:00,758
Today, he offered little in
the way of an apology.

801
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:02,176
Well, what I will say is,

802
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:03,529
there's something wrong
with those people.

803
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:04,553
I am here to help them.

804
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,074
I'm gonna
lift them out of poverty,

805
01:02:06,098 --> 01:02:07,515
help make their lives better.

806
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:08,849
That is why I'm running.

807
01:02:09,017 --> 01:02:11,769
And they may not realize it,
but I'm their only hope.

808
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:30,287
Down with Wayne!
Down with Wayne!

809
01:02:30,372 --> 01:02:33,124
Down with Wayne!
Down with Wayne!

810
01:05:13,702 --> 01:05:14,785
Can I help you, pal?

811
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:18,706
I don't know what to say.

812
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:24,545
Do you want an autograph
or something?

813
01:05:24,713 --> 01:05:25,713
No.

814
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:33,387
My name is Arthur.

815
01:05:34,973 --> 01:05:36,599
Penny fleck is my mother.

816
01:05:37,976 --> 01:05:38,976
Jesus.

817
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:41,901
You're the guy that came to
my house yesterday.

818
01:05:43,315 --> 01:05:44,565
Yes.

819
01:05:45,108 --> 01:05:46,984
I'm sorry I just showed up.

820
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:48,611
But my mother
told me everything,

821
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:50,362
and I had to talk to you.

822
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:52,448
Look, pal, I'm not your father.

823
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:54,533
What's wrong with you?

824
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:57,745
Look at us.

825
01:05:59,247 --> 01:06:00,497
I think you are.

826
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:01,874
Well, that's impossible

827
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:03,709
because you're adopted,

828
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,021
and I never slept with
your mother.

829
01:06:05,045 --> 01:06:06,647
- I wasn't adopted.
- What do you want from me?

830
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:08,047
- Money?
- No, I don't...

831
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:09,256
I wasn't adopted.

832
01:06:09,424 --> 01:06:11,216
Jesus. She never told you?

833
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:13,052
Told me what?

834
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:16,365
Your mother adopted you
while she was working for us.

835
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:17,598
That's not true.

836
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:19,141
Why are you saying that?

837
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:20,369
Then she was arrested
and committed

838
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:21,560
to arkham state hospital,

839
01:06:21,728 --> 01:06:23,103
when you were just a little boy.

840
01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:24,396
Why are you saying this?

841
01:06:24,564 --> 01:06:26,065
I don't need you to
tell me lies.

842
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:27,566
I know it seems strange.

843
01:06:27,651 --> 01:06:29,276
I don't mean to
make you uncomfortable.

844
01:06:29,444 --> 01:06:31,028
I don't know
why everyone is so rude.

845
01:06:31,196 --> 01:06:32,404
I don't know why you are.

846
01:06:32,572 --> 01:06:33,906
I don't want anything from you.

847
01:06:34,074 --> 01:06:36,450
Maybe a little bit of warmth,
maybe a hug, dad!

848
01:06:36,618 --> 01:06:38,619
How about just a little bit
of fucking decency?

849
01:06:38,787 --> 01:06:40,162
What is it with you people?

850
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:42,289
You say that stuff
about my mother.

851
01:06:42,457 --> 01:06:43,832
She's crazy.

852
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:46,001
She's...

853
01:06:53,593 --> 01:06:54,968
You think this is funny?

854
01:06:56,596 --> 01:06:59,765
Dad, it's me. Come on.

855
01:07:02,477 --> 01:07:03,644
Touch my son again,

856
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:05,168
I'll fucking kill you.

857
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:27,835
Hello, Mr. Fleck.
This is detective garrity.

858
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:30,337
We met the other night
at Gotham general.

859
01:07:30,505 --> 01:07:32,798
My partner and I had a few
more questions for you.

860
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:35,884
We stopped by your apartment
today, but you weren't home.

861
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:37,932
Please give me a call
when you get this message.

862
01:07:37,971 --> 01:07:39,888
Again, detective garrity,

863
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:44,059
and my number is 212... 99.

864
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:28,937
This message is
for Arthur fleck.

865
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,814
My name is Shirley woods.

866
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:33,066
I work on
the Murray Franklin show.

867
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:34,378
I don't know if you're aware,

868
01:08:34,402 --> 01:08:36,002
but Murray played
a clip of your stand-up

869
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:37,070
on the show recently,

870
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:40,532
and we have gotten an amazing
response from our viewers.

871
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,910
Murray asked me to give you
a call and see if you're...

872
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:48,665
Who is this?

873
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:50,459
Oh, hi, this is Shirley woods.

874
01:08:50,627 --> 01:08:53,420
I'm the show booker from
live with Murray Franklin.

875
01:08:53,588 --> 01:08:54,630
Is this Arthur?

876
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:57,633
Yes.

877
01:08:57,801 --> 01:08:59,760
Hi, Arthur.
Well, as I was saying,

878
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:01,845
we've gotten a lot of calls
about your clip.

879
01:09:02,013 --> 01:09:03,722
Amazing responses.

880
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:06,183
And Murray asked
if I would reach out to you

881
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:07,893
to see if you would
come on as his guest.

882
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:16,318
Murray wants me
on the Murray Franklin show?

883
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:18,070
Yeah. Isn't that great?

884
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:21,114
He'd love to talk to you,
maybe do some of your act?

885
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:24,284
That sound good to you?

886
01:09:28,623 --> 01:09:30,666
Yeah, that sounds great.

887
01:09:30,834 --> 01:09:32,668
Can we set up a date right now?

888
01:09:32,752 --> 01:09:34,461
Are you available next Thursday?

889
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:28,181
Hey.

890
01:10:29,017 --> 01:10:31,977
Man,
I'm sorry about that, my man.

891
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:34,415
All records 10 years or older,
they store in the basement,

892
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:37,441
and you're talking about
something 30 years ago, so...

893
01:10:38,818 --> 01:10:40,777
Can I ask you a question?

894
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:42,154
Sure.

895
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:46,658
How does someone
wind up in here?

896
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:51,246
Have they all, all the people
committed crimes?

897
01:10:51,873 --> 01:10:53,540
Well, yeah, some have.

898
01:10:53,708 --> 01:10:56,585
You know, some are just crazy.

899
01:10:56,753 --> 01:10:59,212
Pose dangers to
themselves and others.

900
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:00,964
Some just got
nowhere else to go.

901
01:11:01,049 --> 01:11:03,133
Don't know what to do, you know?

902
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:06,970
- Yeah. I hear you, brother.
- Hmm.

903
01:11:07,055 --> 01:11:09,890
Sometimes,
I don't know what to do.

904
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:14,102
Last time, I ended up taking
it out on some people.

905
01:11:15,563 --> 01:11:19,191
I thought it was gonna bother
me, but it really hasn't.

906
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:21,526
What's that?

907
01:11:23,071 --> 01:11:26,448
I fucked up and
did some bad shit.

908
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:31,555
You know what I'm talking about,

909
01:11:31,579 --> 01:11:36,917
it's so hard to just try and
be happy all the time.

910
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:40,712
Hey, listen, man.

911
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:43,173
I'm just
an administrative assistant.

912
01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:44,758
Like a clerk, you know.

913
01:11:44,926 --> 01:11:46,510
All I do is file paperwork.

914
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:49,346
I don't know what to tell you.

915
01:11:49,514 --> 01:11:51,306
But you should see somebody.

916
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:52,724
You know, they got programs,

917
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:55,352
city services, stuff like that.

918
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,853
Oh, yeah.

919
01:11:56,938 --> 01:11:58,618
They cut all those.

920
01:12:03,611 --> 01:12:05,612
All right, here it is.
Fleck.

921
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:07,698
Penny fleck. Let's see.

922
01:12:08,616 --> 01:12:12,202
Diagnosed by
Dr. Benjamin stoner.

923
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:17,791
Oh. "The patient suffers
from delusional psychosis

924
01:12:17,959 --> 01:12:21,420
and narcissistic
personality disorder." Mmm.

925
01:12:22,005 --> 01:12:23,714
"Was found guilty of endangering

926
01:12:23,798 --> 01:12:27,217
the welfare
of her own child."

927
01:12:35,518 --> 01:12:36,518
What?

928
01:12:39,939 --> 01:12:41,398
You said she's your mother.

929
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:47,487
Uh...

930
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:50,073
I'm sorry, man. Like I said,
I can't release these records,

931
01:12:50,241 --> 01:12:52,993
you know, without proper forms.

932
01:12:53,453 --> 01:12:55,120
I could get in trouble.

933
01:12:55,913 --> 01:12:57,956
Look, if you want to bring
your mom in here to sign,

934
01:12:58,124 --> 01:12:59,124
that'll be much easier,

935
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:02,335
but I can't let this go
without her signature, okay?

936
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:03,503
I'm sorry.

937
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:09,885
No, man! Shit!

938
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:12,345
Come on, man. Give it...

939
01:13:13,264 --> 01:13:15,557
Hey! Hey!

940
01:14:13,741 --> 01:14:16,660
We went over this,
penny. You adopted him.

941
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:19,162
We have all the paperwork
right here.

942
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:22,082
That's not true.

943
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:24,501
Thomas had that all made up,

944
01:14:24,669 --> 01:14:27,295
so it stayed our secret.

945
01:14:29,215 --> 01:14:31,633
You also stood by

946
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:33,593
while one of your boyfriends

947
01:14:33,678 --> 01:14:37,139
repeatedly abused
your adopted son

948
01:14:38,516 --> 01:14:39,516
and battered you.

949
01:14:59,287 --> 01:15:00,871
Penny,

950
01:15:01,455 --> 01:15:05,083
your son was found tied
to a radiator

951
01:15:05,251 --> 01:15:07,669
in your filthy apartment.

952
01:15:07,837 --> 01:15:10,338
Malnourished with multiple
bruises across his body

953
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:12,507
and severe trauma to his head.

954
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:16,386
I never heard him cry.

955
01:15:17,305 --> 01:15:20,765
He's always been
such a happy little boy.

956
01:17:21,846 --> 01:17:23,263
It's time for bed.

957
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:27,767
Oh, my god!

958
01:17:28,728 --> 01:17:30,688
What are you doing in here?

959
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:34,816
You're in the wrong apartment.

960
01:17:41,449 --> 01:17:43,158
Your name's Arthur, right?

961
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:44,993
You live down the hall.

962
01:17:48,205 --> 01:17:49,998
I really need you to leave.

963
01:17:54,295 --> 01:17:57,255
My little girl is sleeping
in the other room.

964
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:03,470
Please.

965
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:08,391
I had a bad day.

966
01:18:11,228 --> 01:18:13,730
Can I call someone?
Is your mother home?

967
01:19:39,984 --> 01:19:41,693
Shut up!

968
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,297
Hey, penny.

969
01:20:04,758 --> 01:20:06,092
Penny fleck.

970
01:20:14,268 --> 01:20:16,102
I always hated that name.

971
01:20:19,732 --> 01:20:21,649
You know how you used to tell me

972
01:20:23,694 --> 01:20:26,321
that my laugh was a condition?

973
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:29,949
That there was
something wrong with me?

974
01:20:33,037 --> 01:20:34,245
There isn't.

975
01:20:37,124 --> 01:20:38,458
That's the real me.

976
01:20:39,293 --> 01:20:40,793
Happy.

977
01:20:43,005 --> 01:20:45,465
Happy. Hmm.

978
01:20:48,802 --> 01:20:51,596
I haven't been happy

979
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,932
one minute of
my entire fucking life.

980
01:21:00,898 --> 01:21:02,315
You know what's funny?

981
01:21:05,069 --> 01:21:06,861
You know
what really makes me laugh?

982
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:11,658
I used to think
that my life was a tragedy...

983
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:15,411
But now I realize

984
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:17,163
it's a fucking comedy.

985
01:22:27,693 --> 01:22:28,860
A very fine actor.

986
01:22:29,028 --> 01:22:32,030
He's got a new movie
called American playboy

987
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:34,073
opening this week
across the country.

988
01:22:34,241 --> 01:22:36,075
Will you please welcome
a good friend

989
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,244
of the show, Mr. Ethan chase.

990
01:22:57,931 --> 01:22:59,784
Good to see you, Ethan.
You're looking great, Ethan.

991
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:01,745
Thank you very much.
You're looking good yourself.

992
01:23:01,769 --> 01:23:02,889
Ah, can't complain.

993
01:23:03,270 --> 01:23:05,563
Hey, Murray.
Thanks so much for having...

994
01:23:06,899 --> 01:23:07,940
Hey, Murray.

995
01:23:08,108 --> 01:23:10,109
Thank you so much for
having me on the show.

996
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:12,820
It's been
a lifelong dream of mine.

997
01:23:15,115 --> 01:23:16,355
I'm nervous right now.

998
01:23:18,118 --> 01:23:19,798
- You are?
- I am nervous.

999
01:23:20,371 --> 01:23:21,913
Hey, Murray. I've been on...

1000
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:36,803
I'm sorry. What's that?

1001
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:39,972
Oh, that's very funny, Murray.

1002
01:23:41,266 --> 01:23:43,434
You know, I'm also a comedian.

1003
01:23:43,602 --> 01:23:44,894
Would you like to hear a joke?

1004
01:23:46,105 --> 01:23:48,314
Yeah? All of you?

1005
01:23:48,816 --> 01:23:49,816
Okay.

1006
01:23:52,861 --> 01:23:53,945
Knock...

1007
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:55,154
Knock, knock.

1008
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:10,336
Knock, knock.

1009
01:24:31,275 --> 01:24:32,442
That's life

1010
01:24:32,526 --> 01:24:34,235
that's life

1011
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:37,238
that's what all the people say

1012
01:24:38,657 --> 01:24:41,534
you're riding high in April

1013
01:24:41,618 --> 01:24:44,287
shot down in may

1014
01:24:44,371 --> 01:24:49,041
but I know I'm gonna change that tune

1015
01:24:50,586 --> 01:24:55,214
when I'm back on top
back on top in June

1016
01:24:55,799 --> 01:24:58,217
I said, that's life

1017
01:24:58,302 --> 01:25:00,344
that's life

1018
01:25:00,429 --> 01:25:03,639
and as funny as it may seem

1019
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:06,684
some people get their kicks

1020
01:25:07,394 --> 01:25:10,062
stompin' on a dream

1021
01:25:10,814 --> 01:25:14,567
but I don't let it,
let it get me down

1022
01:25:16,361 --> 01:25:18,696
'cause this fine old world

1023
01:25:18,781 --> 01:25:21,282
it keeps spinnin' around

1024
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:25,369
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate

1025
01:25:25,454 --> 01:25:28,956
a poet, a pawn and a king

1026
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:33,085
I've been up and down and over and out

1027
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:35,296
and I know one thing

1028
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:41,010
each time I find myself flat on my face

1029
01:25:42,012 --> 01:25:48,184
I pick myself up
and get back in the race

1030
01:25:48,268 --> 01:25:49,393
that's life

1031
01:25:49,478 --> 01:25:51,158
that's life

1032
01:25:51,230 --> 01:25:54,106
I tell ya, I can't deny it

1033
01:25:55,692 --> 01:25:57,568
I thought of quitting, baby

1034
01:25:58,821 --> 01:26:01,364
but my heart just ain't gonna buy it

1035
01:26:01,448 --> 01:26:04,909
and if I didn't think
it was worth one single try

1036
01:26:07,663 --> 01:26:08,746
coming.

1037
01:26:08,831 --> 01:26:12,375
I'd jump right on a big bird
and then I'd fly...

1038
01:26:19,842 --> 01:26:21,259
Hey, Arthur.

1039
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:22,426
How's it going?

1040
01:26:23,428 --> 01:26:24,720
Oh, hey, guys.

1041
01:26:25,264 --> 01:26:26,389
Come on in.

1042
01:26:26,849 --> 01:26:27,974
Did you get a new gig?

1043
01:26:28,684 --> 01:26:29,684
No.

1044
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:33,646
Oh, you must be going down to
that rally at city hall.

1045
01:26:33,814 --> 01:26:35,481
I hear it's gonna be nuts.

1046
01:26:35,649 --> 01:26:37,233
Oh, is that today?

1047
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:38,943
Yeah.

1048
01:26:39,862 --> 01:26:41,279
What's with the makeup then?

1049
01:26:42,739 --> 01:26:44,240
My mom died.

1050
01:26:44,408 --> 01:26:45,616
I'm celebrating.

1051
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:47,535
Right. We heard.

1052
01:26:47,703 --> 01:26:48,744
That's why we came by.

1053
01:26:48,912 --> 01:26:51,622
We figured, you know, you
could use some cheering up.

1054
01:26:52,165 --> 01:26:53,791
Aw, that's sweet.

1055
01:26:53,959 --> 01:26:56,836
But, no, I feel good.

1056
01:26:57,629 --> 01:26:59,255
Yeah, I stopped
taking my medication.

1057
01:26:59,423 --> 01:27:01,048
I feel a lot better now.

1058
01:27:03,176 --> 01:27:05,678
Oh, okay. Good for you.

1059
01:27:07,806 --> 01:27:10,683
So, hey, listen,
I don't know if you heard,

1060
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:13,269
but the cops have been coming
around the shop,

1061
01:27:14,021 --> 01:27:17,940
talking to all the guys
about those subway murders.

1062
01:27:18,066 --> 01:27:19,859
- And, um...
- They didn't talk to me.

1063
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:24,488
That's because the suspect
was a regular-sized person.

1064
01:27:25,032 --> 01:27:27,533
If it was a fucking midget,
you'd be in jail right now.

1065
01:27:33,332 --> 01:27:34,582
Anyway, um,

1066
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:38,753
hoyt said
that they talked to you,

1067
01:27:38,921 --> 01:27:40,212
and now they're looking for me,

1068
01:27:40,297 --> 01:27:41,881
and I just wanna know
what you said.

1069
01:27:42,049 --> 01:27:43,466
Make sure our stories line up.

1070
01:27:43,634 --> 01:27:46,677
- Seeing as how you're my boy.
- Yeah, that's important.

1071
01:27:46,845 --> 01:27:48,656
- That makes a lot of sense.
- You know what I mean?

1072
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:50,348
Thank you, Randall.
Thank you so much.

1073
01:27:56,146 --> 01:27:57,146
Arthur!

1074
01:27:57,814 --> 01:27:59,148
No!

1075
01:28:00,484 --> 01:28:01,484
What?

1076
01:28:02,819 --> 01:28:03,819
No!

1077
01:28:11,745 --> 01:28:13,829
Why would you do that, Arthur?

1078
01:28:34,893 --> 01:28:37,061
Do you watch
the Murray Franklin show?

1079
01:28:37,145 --> 01:28:38,562
Yeah.

1080
01:28:39,898 --> 01:28:41,691
I'm gonna be on tonight.

1081
01:28:45,988 --> 01:28:47,738
It fucking crazy, innit?

1082
01:28:47,823 --> 01:28:49,657
Me on the telly.

1083
01:28:51,702 --> 01:28:53,661
What the fuck, Arthur?

1084
01:28:54,913 --> 01:28:55,997
What?

1085
01:29:01,003 --> 01:29:02,211
It's okay, Gary.

1086
01:29:02,671 --> 01:29:03,671
You can go.

1087
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:07,883
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1088
01:29:10,846 --> 01:29:12,304
Oh!

1089
01:29:12,556 --> 01:29:14,640
Don't look. Just go.

1090
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:28,195
Fuck.

1091
01:29:33,493 --> 01:29:34,660
Hey, Arthur?

1092
01:29:34,828 --> 01:29:35,828
Yeah?

1093
01:29:37,039 --> 01:29:39,457
Arthur, can you get the lock?

1094
01:29:42,669 --> 01:29:43,669
Shit.

1095
01:29:44,129 --> 01:29:45,588
Sorry, Gary.

1096
01:29:56,558 --> 01:29:57,600
Gary?

1097
01:29:57,768 --> 01:29:58,768
Yeah.

1098
01:30:01,313 --> 01:30:03,898
You were the only one
that was ever nice to me.

1099
01:30:05,984 --> 01:30:07,193
Skedaddle.

1100
01:31:34,406 --> 01:31:35,739
Hey, Arthur!

1101
01:31:35,907 --> 01:31:37,283
We need to talk.

1102
01:31:37,534 --> 01:31:38,659
Oh!

1103
01:31:38,743 --> 01:31:40,744
Hey! Stop, Arthur!

1104
01:31:46,168 --> 01:31:47,251
Arthur!

1105
01:31:49,838 --> 01:31:51,463
Watch it!
Out of the way!

1106
01:31:54,634 --> 01:31:55,634
Move!

1107
01:31:57,637 --> 01:31:58,677
Arthur!

1108
01:31:59,681 --> 01:32:00,931
Shit.

1109
01:32:03,310 --> 01:32:04,393
Hey! Hey!

1110
01:32:11,443 --> 01:32:12,443
Arthur, stop!

1111
01:32:18,158 --> 01:32:19,158
Go! Go!

1112
01:32:21,286 --> 01:32:23,286
Now
departing, o-train, downtown.

1113
01:32:25,123 --> 01:32:26,874
Stand clear of
the closing doors.

1114
01:32:36,301 --> 01:32:38,928
Hold that train! Hold it!

1115
01:32:40,847 --> 01:32:42,056
Get out! Get outta here!

1116
01:32:43,183 --> 01:32:44,823
Next stop, bedford park.

1117
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:00,199
Masks off!

1118
01:33:00,367 --> 01:33:01,742
Get your mask off!

1119
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:04,328
Signs down! Now!

1120
01:33:13,505 --> 01:33:14,964
Police! Signs down!

1121
01:33:16,132 --> 01:33:17,216
Signs down.

1122
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:23,097
What the fuck!

1123
01:33:26,017 --> 01:33:27,577
Beat his ass!

1124
01:33:33,942 --> 01:33:35,484
Stop fighting! Police!

1125
01:33:35,652 --> 01:33:37,778
Police! Get down!

1126
01:33:39,948 --> 01:33:42,074
Get down! Get the fuck back!

1127
01:33:43,159 --> 01:33:44,159
Police! Get down.

1128
01:33:45,078 --> 01:33:46,203
Get the fuck down!

1129
01:33:50,917 --> 01:33:53,335
Stay the fuck back! Down!

1130
01:33:56,965 --> 01:33:57,965
What the...

1131
01:34:01,344 --> 01:34:02,344
Arthur!

1132
01:34:02,929 --> 01:34:03,971
Burke!

1133
01:34:05,598 --> 01:34:07,057
Don't do it!

1134
01:34:56,900 --> 01:34:58,067
Two officers on the train

1135
01:34:58,151 --> 01:34:59,671
were violently confronted
by the crowd,

1136
01:34:59,736 --> 01:35:01,153
and tonight are in serious

1137
01:35:01,237 --> 01:35:03,447
but stable condition
at Gotham metropolitan.

1138
01:35:03,531 --> 01:35:05,115
We're going live now to

1139
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:06,992
co-anchor Courtney weathers,

1140
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:09,160
who's standing by outside
the bedford park station,

1141
01:35:09,245 --> 01:35:11,080
near where the shooting
took place.

1142
01:35:11,247 --> 01:35:13,123
Courtney,
what's the scene there?

1143
01:35:18,129 --> 01:35:19,171
Murray.

1144
01:35:19,339 --> 01:35:20,923
Hey, hey, hey.
It's Mr. Franklin, buddy.

1145
01:35:21,091 --> 01:35:23,467
Oh, come on, gene.
That's all bullshit.

1146
01:35:24,552 --> 01:35:25,761
Thank you, Murray.

1147
01:35:26,971 --> 01:35:28,722
I feel like I know you.

1148
01:35:29,224 --> 01:35:31,058
I've been watching you forever.

1149
01:35:31,226 --> 01:35:32,351
Thank you.

1150
01:35:32,519 --> 01:35:33,811
What's with the face?

1151
01:35:33,978 --> 01:35:35,938
I mean,
are you part of the protest?

1152
01:35:36,106 --> 01:35:37,106
No.

1153
01:35:37,273 --> 01:35:39,024
No, I don't believe
in any of that.

1154
01:35:39,734 --> 01:35:41,318
I don't believe in anything.

1155
01:35:41,945 --> 01:35:43,487
I just thought
it'd be good for my act.

1156
01:35:43,655 --> 01:35:45,155
For your act? Didn't you hear

1157
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:46,717
what happened on the subway?
Some clown got killed.

1158
01:35:46,741 --> 01:35:48,427
He's aware of that.
He's aware of that. Yeah.

1159
01:35:48,451 --> 01:35:49,701
No, I hadn't heard.

1160
01:35:50,161 --> 01:35:51,245
- Yeah.
- You see?

1161
01:35:51,329 --> 01:35:52,723
This is what I'm telling you.
The audience is gonna go crazy

1162
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:53,747
if you put this guy on.

1163
01:35:53,873 --> 01:35:55,999
Maybe for a bit,
but not a whole segment.

1164
01:35:56,167 --> 01:35:58,377
Gene, it's gonna work.
It's gonna work.

1165
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:01,250
We're gonna go with it.

1166
01:36:01,506 --> 01:36:02,506
Thank you, Murray.

1167
01:36:03,091 --> 01:36:04,216
Couple rules, though.

1168
01:36:04,384 --> 01:36:06,135
No cursing.
No off-color material.

1169
01:36:06,302 --> 01:36:07,761
We do a clean show.

1170
01:36:07,929 --> 01:36:08,929
- Okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

1171
01:36:09,097 --> 01:36:10,681
You'll go on
right after Dr. Sally.

1172
01:36:10,849 --> 01:36:11,849
I love Dr. Sally.

1173
01:36:12,016 --> 01:36:13,434
Good, good. Someone will

1174
01:36:13,518 --> 01:36:15,686
- come and get you, okay?
- Okay. Perfect.

1175
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:16,895
Good luck.

1176
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:17,980
- Thanks, Murray.
- Okay.

1177
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:22,401
- Murray, one small thing.
- Yeah.

1178
01:36:22,569 --> 01:36:24,236
When you bring me out,

1179
01:36:24,404 --> 01:36:26,280
can you introduce me as joker?

1180
01:36:26,448 --> 01:36:28,157
What's wrong
with your real name?

1181
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:31,034
That's what you called me
on the show.

1182
01:36:31,202 --> 01:36:32,327
A joker.

1183
01:36:32,495 --> 01:36:33,495
Do you remember?

1184
01:36:33,872 --> 01:36:35,873
- Did I?
- I don't know.

1185
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:38,125
Well, if you say so, kid,
you know, joker it is.

1186
01:36:38,293 --> 01:36:39,293
It's good.

1187
01:36:39,461 --> 01:36:40,544
Thanks, Murray.

1188
01:37:02,817 --> 01:37:03,919
I'll try it, you know,

1189
01:37:03,943 --> 01:37:05,819
but I'm not sure
my wife will let me do it.

1190
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:08,614
Maybe my next wife.

1191
01:37:12,327 --> 01:37:14,077
You gotta see
our next guest for yourself.

1192
01:37:14,245 --> 01:37:16,288
I'm pretty sure
this guy could use a doctor.

1193
01:37:16,623 --> 01:37:17,683
Oh!

1194
01:37:17,707 --> 01:37:19,082
Does he have sexual problems?

1195
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:21,668
Oh, he looks like
he's got a lot of problems.

1196
01:37:22,879 --> 01:37:25,506
All right, Bobby, let's show
that clip one last time.

1197
01:37:31,930 --> 01:37:34,806
I hated school as a kid.

1198
01:37:36,601 --> 01:37:38,769
But my mother would always say,

1199
01:37:39,812 --> 01:37:41,123
"you should enjoy it.

1200
01:37:41,147 --> 01:37:44,274
One day, you'll have to
work for a living."

1201
01:37:44,442 --> 01:37:45,669
"No, I won't, ma.

1202
01:37:45,693 --> 01:37:47,653
I'm gonna be a comedian."

1203
01:37:53,952 --> 01:37:56,245
Okay. You may...

1204
01:37:57,705 --> 01:38:00,958
You may have seen that clip
of our next guest.

1205
01:38:01,125 --> 01:38:03,502
Now, before he comes out,
I just want to say

1206
01:38:03,670 --> 01:38:05,170
that we're all heartbroken

1207
01:38:05,255 --> 01:38:07,214
about what's going on
in the city tonight.

1208
01:38:07,382 --> 01:38:09,675
But this is
how he wanted to come out,

1209
01:38:09,842 --> 01:38:13,053
and honestly, I think
we could all use a good laugh.

1210
01:38:13,221 --> 01:38:15,389
So, please welcome, joker.

1211
01:38:58,016 --> 01:38:59,391
Are you all right, doctor?

1212
01:39:03,229 --> 01:39:05,689
Well,
that was quite an entrance.

1213
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:13,238
You okay?

1214
01:39:16,075 --> 01:39:17,492
Yeah.

1215
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:20,370
This is exactly
how I imagined it.

1216
01:39:22,332 --> 01:39:24,124
Well, that makes one of us.

1217
01:39:31,007 --> 01:39:33,175
So, can you tell us
about this look?

1218
01:39:33,343 --> 01:39:34,676
When we spoke earlier,

1219
01:39:34,761 --> 01:39:36,864
you mentioned that this look
is not a political statement.

1220
01:39:36,888 --> 01:39:37,929
Is that right?

1221
01:39:38,097 --> 01:39:39,723
That's right, Murray.
I'm not political.

1222
01:39:39,891 --> 01:39:42,434
I'm just trying to
make people laugh.

1223
01:39:42,602 --> 01:39:44,682
And how's that going for you?

1224
01:39:52,695 --> 01:39:54,529
So, I know you're a comedian.

1225
01:39:54,697 --> 01:39:56,531
You been working on
any new material?

1226
01:39:56,616 --> 01:39:57,741
You wanna tell us a joke?

1227
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:04,456
Yeah?

1228
01:40:06,626 --> 01:40:07,626
Okay.

1229
01:40:13,675 --> 01:40:15,300
He's got a book.

1230
01:40:16,219 --> 01:40:17,678
A book of jokes.

1231
01:40:27,522 --> 01:40:28,897
Take your time.
We got all night.

1232
01:40:34,946 --> 01:40:37,239
Okay, okay. Here's one.

1233
01:40:40,368 --> 01:40:42,869
Knock, knock.

1234
01:40:43,037 --> 01:40:44,371
And you had to look that up?

1235
01:40:51,504 --> 01:40:53,130
I want to get it right.

1236
01:40:54,966 --> 01:40:56,508
Knock, knock.

1237
01:40:56,676 --> 01:40:58,176
Who's there?

1238
01:40:59,637 --> 01:41:01,054
It's the police, ma'am.

1239
01:41:01,222 --> 01:41:03,056
Your son's been hit
by a drunk driver.

1240
01:41:03,224 --> 01:41:05,642
He's dead.

1241
01:41:07,562 --> 01:41:09,146
Oh, no, no, no.

1242
01:41:09,313 --> 01:41:11,064
No, you cannot joke about that.

1243
01:41:11,232 --> 01:41:13,191
Yeah, that's not funny, Arthur.

1244
01:41:13,359 --> 01:41:15,819
That's not the kind of humor
we do on this show.

1245
01:41:16,404 --> 01:41:18,697
Okay. I'm... yeah, I'm sorry.

1246
01:41:18,865 --> 01:41:23,243
It's just, you know, it's been
a rough few weeks, Murray.

1247
01:41:24,829 --> 01:41:26,663
Ever since

1248
01:41:29,208 --> 01:41:31,334
I killed
those three wall street guys.

1249
01:41:37,925 --> 01:41:39,885
Okay, I'm waiting
for the punchline.

1250
01:41:41,387 --> 01:41:43,096
There is no punchline.

1251
01:41:44,515 --> 01:41:46,391
It's not a joke.

1252
01:41:51,063 --> 01:41:52,147
You're serious, aren't you?

1253
01:41:52,315 --> 01:41:53,375
You're telling us you killed

1254
01:41:53,399 --> 01:41:54,668
those three young men
on the subway?

1255
01:41:54,692 --> 01:41:55,692
Mmm-hmm.

1256
01:41:55,860 --> 01:41:57,569
And why should we believe you?

1257
01:41:57,737 --> 01:41:59,696
I got nothing left to lose.

1258
01:42:01,699 --> 01:42:03,742
Nothing can hurt me anymore.

1259
01:42:06,913 --> 01:42:09,790
My life is nothing but a comedy.

1260
01:42:13,419 --> 01:42:14,521
Well, let me get this straight,

1261
01:42:14,545 --> 01:42:16,797
you think that killing
those guys is funny?

1262
01:42:17,465 --> 01:42:18,965
I do.

1263
01:42:19,133 --> 01:42:21,760
And I'm tired
of pretending it's not.

1264
01:42:21,928 --> 01:42:23,804
Comedy is subjective, Murray.

1265
01:42:24,263 --> 01:42:25,972
Isn't that what they say?

1266
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:27,891
All of you,

1267
01:42:28,059 --> 01:42:30,644
the system that knows so much,

1268
01:42:30,812 --> 01:42:33,522
you decide
what's right or wrong.

1269
01:42:33,689 --> 01:42:38,902
The same way that you decide
what's funny or not!

1270
01:42:40,238 --> 01:42:41,238
Get him off!

1271
01:42:41,989 --> 01:42:45,659
Well, okay,
I think I might understand

1272
01:42:45,993 --> 01:42:47,494
that you did this to
start a movement,

1273
01:42:47,578 --> 01:42:49,579
to become a symbol?

1274
01:42:50,206 --> 01:42:51,748
Come on, Murray.

1275
01:42:51,916 --> 01:42:53,143
Do I look like the kind of clown

1276
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:54,751
that could start a movement?

1277
01:42:54,919 --> 01:42:57,754
I killed those guys
because they were awful.

1278
01:42:57,922 --> 01:43:00,423
Everybody is awful these days.

1279
01:43:00,591 --> 01:43:02,884
It's enough to
make anyone crazy.

1280
01:43:03,052 --> 01:43:04,803
Okay. So, that's it,
you're crazy.

1281
01:43:04,971 --> 01:43:07,264
That's your defense
for killing three young men?

1282
01:43:07,890 --> 01:43:09,432
No.

1283
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:12,936
They couldn't carry a tune
to save their lives.

1284
01:43:14,772 --> 01:43:18,191
Oh, why is everybody
so upset about these guys?

1285
01:43:19,068 --> 01:43:20,819
If it was me
dying on the sidewalk,

1286
01:43:20,903 --> 01:43:22,279
you'd walk right over me!

1287
01:43:22,446 --> 01:43:24,573
I pass you every day,
and you don't notice me.

1288
01:43:24,740 --> 01:43:26,992
But these guys, what,
because Thomas Wayne

1289
01:43:27,076 --> 01:43:28,618
went and cried about them on TV?

1290
01:43:28,786 --> 01:43:30,829
You have a problem
with Thomas Wayne, too?

1291
01:43:30,997 --> 01:43:32,914
Yes, I do.

1292
01:43:33,082 --> 01:43:36,501
Have you seen what it's like
out there, Murray?

1293
01:43:36,669 --> 01:43:39,713
Do you ever actually
leave the studio?

1294
01:43:39,881 --> 01:43:43,717
Everybody just yells
and screams at each other.

1295
01:43:43,885 --> 01:43:46,052
Nobody's civil anymore.

1296
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:49,806
Nobody thinks what it's like
to be the other guy.

1297
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:53,393
You think men like
Thomas Wayne ever think

1298
01:43:53,477 --> 01:43:55,437
what it's like to be
someone like me?

1299
01:43:55,605 --> 01:43:58,315
To be somebody but themselves?
They don't.

1300
01:43:58,524 --> 01:44:00,650
They think that
we'll just sit there

1301
01:44:00,735 --> 01:44:03,111
and take it,
like good little boys!

1302
01:44:03,404 --> 01:44:05,488
That we won't werewolf
and go wild!

1303
01:44:05,656 --> 01:44:07,282
You finished?

1304
01:44:07,450 --> 01:44:09,784
I mean, it's so much
self-pity, Arthur.

1305
01:44:09,952 --> 01:44:11,494
You sound like
you're making excuses

1306
01:44:11,579 --> 01:44:12,996
for killing those young men.

1307
01:44:13,164 --> 01:44:14,998
Not everybody,
and I'll tell you this,

1308
01:44:15,082 --> 01:44:16,499
not everyone is awful.

1309
01:44:18,794 --> 01:44:20,003
You're awful, Murray.

1310
01:44:20,171 --> 01:44:22,047
Me? I'm awful?

1311
01:44:22,214 --> 01:44:23,965
Oh, yeah, how am I awful?

1312
01:44:26,135 --> 01:44:27,594
Playing my video.

1313
01:44:29,013 --> 01:44:30,889
Inviting me on this show.

1314
01:44:31,974 --> 01:44:34,309
You just wanted to
make fun of me.

1315
01:44:35,311 --> 01:44:37,270
You're just like
the rest of them.

1316
01:44:37,438 --> 01:44:39,356
You don't know
the first thing about me, pal.

1317
01:44:39,523 --> 01:44:42,108
Look what happened, because of
what you did. What it led to.

1318
01:44:42,276 --> 01:44:43,985
There are riots out there.

1319
01:44:44,153 --> 01:44:45,672
Two policemen are
in critical condition,

1320
01:44:45,696 --> 01:44:46,965
and you're laughing.

1321
01:44:46,989 --> 01:44:47,989
You're laughing.

1322
01:44:48,157 --> 01:44:50,992
Someone was killed today,
because of what you did.

1323
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:52,619
I know.

1324
01:44:55,206 --> 01:44:56,446
How about another joke, Murray?

1325
01:44:56,582 --> 01:44:58,262
No, I think we've had
enough of your jokes.

1326
01:44:58,376 --> 01:44:59,728
- What do you get...
- I don't think so.

1327
01:44:59,752 --> 01:45:02,295
When you cross
a mentally-ill loner

1328
01:45:02,463 --> 01:45:04,881
with a society that abandons him

1329
01:45:04,966 --> 01:45:06,007
and treats him like trash?

1330
01:45:06,175 --> 01:45:07,175
Call the police, gene!

1331
01:45:07,343 --> 01:45:08,779
- I'll tell you what you get!
- Call the police.

1332
01:45:08,803 --> 01:45:10,470
You get
what you fucking deserve!

1333
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:50,135
Good night.
And always remember, that's...

1334
01:45:55,516 --> 01:45:56,766
Breaking news.

1335
01:45:56,934 --> 01:45:59,477
Popular TV talk show host,
Murray Franklin

1336
01:45:59,645 --> 01:46:01,915
was shot dead tonight on the
live telecast of his program.

1337
01:46:01,939 --> 01:46:04,232
The man who was
introduced by Franklin

1338
01:46:04,316 --> 01:46:07,193
as "joker" is
currently under arrest.

1339
01:46:07,361 --> 01:46:09,946
Police led the suspect
handcuffed out of the studio.

1340
01:46:11,699 --> 01:46:14,242
Merely just a punchline
to a joke...

1341
01:46:14,410 --> 01:46:16,050
You get what you
deserve!

1342
01:46:16,162 --> 01:46:17,264
Looting and rioting

1343
01:46:17,288 --> 01:46:18,329
have intensified here...

1344
01:46:18,497 --> 01:46:19,975
...rioting
throughout the city.

1345
01:46:19,999 --> 01:46:21,309
...with a society
that abandons him

1346
01:46:21,333 --> 01:46:22,375
and treats him like trash?

1347
01:46:22,460 --> 01:46:23,729
This mob of clowns...

1348
01:46:23,753 --> 01:46:25,313
Many wearing clown masks.

1349
01:46:27,214 --> 01:46:28,894
If it was me
dying on the sidewalk,

1350
01:46:28,966 --> 01:46:30,360
- you'd walk right over me.
- To all of

1351
01:46:30,384 --> 01:46:31,862
those who have been
ignored by the system.

1352
01:46:31,886 --> 01:46:33,155
And always remember,
that's life!

1353
01:46:33,179 --> 01:46:35,847
And as you see,
Gotham is burning.

1354
01:46:37,308 --> 01:46:41,478
In the white room
with black curtains near the station

1355
01:46:44,982 --> 01:46:49,944
black roof country, no gold pavements
tired starlings

1356
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:56,659
silver horses ran down moonbeams

1357
01:46:58,788 --> 01:47:00,830
in your dark eyes

1358
01:47:02,833 --> 01:47:08,922
dawnlight smiles on you leaving
my contentment

1359
01:47:14,220 --> 01:47:18,223
I'll wait in this place
where the sun never shines

1360
01:47:21,060 --> 01:47:24,229
wait in this place

1361
01:47:24,313 --> 01:47:29,859
where the shadows run from themselves

1362
01:47:31,070 --> 01:47:33,270
stop laughing,
you freak! This isn't funny.

1363
01:47:33,697 --> 01:47:35,008
Yeah, the whole
fucking city's on fire

1364
01:47:35,032 --> 01:47:36,032
'cause of what you did.

1365
01:47:37,243 --> 01:47:39,536
All units,
fire reported, north of alley.

1366
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:41,162
Code four for medical.

1367
01:47:41,789 --> 01:47:43,248
I know.

1368
01:47:44,750 --> 01:47:46,751
Isn't it beautiful?

1369
01:49:29,230 --> 01:49:30,563
Go over there.

1370
01:49:48,457 --> 01:49:49,582
Hey, Wayne.

1371
01:49:50,542 --> 01:49:52,293
You get
what you fucking deserve.

1372
01:49:52,461 --> 01:49:53,586
No! Pal!

1373
01:50:34,378 --> 01:50:36,379
Come on, get up!

1374
01:50:36,547 --> 01:50:38,506
Come on, man, get up.

1375
01:53:17,708 --> 01:53:19,792
What's so funny?

1376
01:53:23,797 --> 01:53:25,381
Just thinking of a joke.

1377
01:53:44,568 --> 01:53:46,569
Do you want to tell it to me?

1378
01:53:52,743 --> 01:53:54,368
You wouldn't get it.

1379
01:54:06,423 --> 01:54:08,090
That's life

1380
01:54:08,175 --> 01:54:09,634
that's life

1381
01:54:09,718 --> 01:54:12,637
and as funny as it may seem

1382
01:54:14,097 --> 01:54:16,807
some people get their kicks

1383
01:54:16,975 --> 01:54:19,101
stompin' on a dream

1384
01:54:20,145 --> 01:54:23,814
but I don't let it,
let it get me down

1385
01:54:25,984 --> 01:54:28,152
'cause this fine old world

1386
01:54:28,278 --> 01:54:30,863
it keeps spinnin' around

1387
01:54:31,615 --> 01:54:34,909
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate

1388
01:54:34,993 --> 01:54:38,246
a poet, a pawn and a king

1389
01:54:38,330 --> 01:54:42,291
I've been up and down and over and out

1390
01:54:42,376 --> 01:54:44,544
and I know one thing

1391
01:54:44,878 --> 01:54:50,716
each time I find myself flat on my face

1392
01:54:51,134 --> 01:54:57,181
I pick myself up
and get back in the race

1393
01:54:57,558 --> 01:54:58,766
that's life

1394
01:54:58,850 --> 01:54:59,934
that's life

1395
01:55:00,018 --> 01:55:04,063
that's life
and I can't deny it

1396
01:55:04,773 --> 01:55:10,027
many times I thought of cuttin' out
but my heart won't buy it

1397
01:55:10,612 --> 01:55:15,199
but if there's nothing shakin'
come here this July

1398
01:55:18,161 --> 01:55:24,333
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball

1399
01:55:24,835 --> 01:55:31,048
and die

1400
01:55:32,843 --> 01:55:38,681
my, my

1401
01:55:50,068 --> 01:55:52,570
Isn't it rich?

1402
01:55:54,906 --> 01:55:57,700
Are we a pair?

1403
01:55:59,745 --> 01:56:03,539
Me here at last on the ground

1404
01:56:03,790 --> 01:56:07,043
you in mid-air

1405
01:56:09,087 --> 01:56:13,716
send in the clowns

1406
01:56:20,515 --> 01:56:23,059
Isn't it bliss?

1407
01:56:25,937 --> 01:56:29,273
Don't you approve?

1408
01:56:30,942 --> 01:56:34,612
One who keeps tearing around

1409
01:56:34,696 --> 01:56:38,866
one who can't move

1410
01:56:41,828 --> 01:56:47,041
where are the clowns?

1411
01:56:48,335 --> 01:56:52,171
Send in the clowns

1412
01:56:53,131 --> 01:56:55,883
just when I stopped

1413
01:56:57,386 --> 01:57:00,554
opening doors

1414
01:57:02,307 --> 01:57:08,979
finally knowing
the one that I wanted was yours

1415
01:57:11,108 --> 01:57:17,780
making my entrance again
with my usual flair

1416
01:57:21,034 --> 01:57:25,996
sure of my lines

1417
01:57:27,749 --> 01:57:32,712
no one is there

1418
01:57:40,095 --> 01:57:44,098
Don't you love farce?

1419
01:57:46,893 --> 01:57:49,937
My fault, I fear

1420
01:57:52,399 --> 01:57:56,444
I thought that you'd want what I want

1421
01:57:56,528 --> 01:58:00,197
sorry, my dear

1422
01:58:02,492 --> 01:58:07,163
but where are the clowns?

1423
01:58:09,499 --> 01:58:14,462
There ought to be clowns

1424
01:58:15,630 --> 01:58:22,595
well, maybe next year
