1
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:51,313
(thunder rumbling)

2
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:52,615
# Under blue moon,
I saw you

3
00:02:52,684 --> 00:02:56,279
# So soon
you'll take me

4
00:02:56,354 --> 00:03:00,882
# Up in your arms,
too late to beg you

5
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:04,689
# Or cancel it
though I know it must be

6
00:03:04,764 --> 00:03:08,165
# The killing time

7
00:03:08,234 --> 00:03:11,101
# Unwillingly mine

8
00:03:12,338 --> 00:03:14,670
# Fate

9
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,868
# Up against your will

10
00:03:17,944 --> 00:03:22,904
# Through the thick
and thin

11
00:03:22,983 --> 00:03:26,783
# He will wait until

12
00:03:26,853 --> 00:03:30,482
# You give yourself
to him

13
00:03:35,496 --> 00:03:37,464
(whirring)

14
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:42,694
# In starlit nights
I saw you

15
00:03:42,771 --> 00:03:47,731
# So cruelly
you kissed me

16
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,507
# Your lips
a magic world

17
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:55,072
# Your sky all hung
with jewels

18
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:58,712
# The killing moon

19
00:03:58,788 --> 00:04:02,087
# Will come too soon

20
00:04:03,393 --> 00:04:05,327
# Fate

21
00:04:05,395 --> 00:04:09,593
# Up against your will

22
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:11,965
# Through the thick
and thin...

23
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:23,339
I'm voting
for Dukakis.

24
00:04:27,586 --> 00:04:29,679
Well...

25
00:04:31,256 --> 00:04:33,451
Maybe when you have children
of your own

26
00:04:33,525 --> 00:04:36,392
who need braces
and you can't afford them

27
00:04:36,496 --> 00:04:38,828
because half
of your husband's paycheck

28
00:04:38,931 --> 00:04:41,900
goes to the Federal Government,
you'll regret that.

29
00:04:41,968 --> 00:04:43,595
My husband's
paycheck?

30
00:04:43,703 --> 00:04:46,069
(chuckles)

31
00:04:46,138 --> 00:04:49,630
Anyway, I'm not going to squeeze
one out till I'm, like, 30.

32
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,837
Will you still be working
at the Yarn Barn?

33
00:04:51,912 --> 00:04:54,346
I hear that's a great place
to raise children.

34
00:04:54,414 --> 00:04:56,143
That's really funny.

35
00:04:56,216 --> 00:04:58,878
No, I think a year
of partying is enough.

36
00:04:58,952 --> 00:05:00,510
She'll be going
to Harvard next fall.

37
00:05:00,588 --> 00:05:02,283
Mom, I haven't even
gotten in yet.

38
00:05:02,357 --> 00:05:04,723
Do you honestly think
Michael Dukakis will provide

39
00:05:04,792 --> 00:05:06,885
for this country till
you're ready to squeeze one out?

40
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:08,553
Yeah, I do.

41
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,724
- When can I squeeze one out?
- Not until 8th grade.

42
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:15,203
Excuse me?

43
00:05:15,271 --> 00:05:17,671
Donnie, you're such
a dick.

44
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,708
Donnie:
Whoa, Elizabeth!

45
00:05:19,808 --> 00:05:22,242
A little hostile there.

46
00:05:22,311 --> 00:05:24,370
Maybe you should be
the one in therapy.

47
00:05:24,446 --> 00:05:26,539
Then Mom and Dad
can pay someone $200 an hour

48
00:05:26,616 --> 00:05:29,380
to listen to your thoughts
so we don't have to.

49
00:05:30,453 --> 00:05:32,683
Okay.
You want to tell Mom and Dad

50
00:05:32,756 --> 00:05:34,348
why you stopped taking
your medication?

51
00:05:34,424 --> 00:05:37,086
- You're such a fuck-ass!
- What?!

52
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,991
Please.

53
00:05:39,063 --> 00:05:41,258
Did you just call me
a "fuck-ass"?

54
00:05:41,332 --> 00:05:44,301
- Elizabeth, that's enough.
- You can go suck a fuck.

55
00:05:44,368 --> 00:05:46,836
Tell me, Elizabeth,
how does one suck a fuck?

56
00:05:46,904 --> 00:05:48,701
- You want me to tell you?
- Tell me.

57
00:05:48,773 --> 00:05:51,333
We will not have this
at the dinner table.

58
00:05:51,443 --> 00:05:53,377
- Mother: Stop.
- Fuck.

59
00:06:02,788 --> 00:06:06,121
What's a fuck-ass?

60
00:06:06,192 --> 00:06:07,523
(brief laugh)

61
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:11,926
(quick knocking)

62
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:17,398
I'm reading.
Get out of my room.

63
00:06:21,075 --> 00:06:23,009
Where do you go at night?

64
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:26,742
Would you just get out
of my room?

65
00:06:26,814 --> 00:06:28,645
Did you toilet paper
the Johnsons' house?

66
00:06:28,716 --> 00:06:30,240
Is that what
you came in here to ask me?

67
00:06:30,318 --> 00:06:31,512
No.

68
00:06:32,754 --> 00:06:35,279
I stopped rolling houses
in the sixth grade, Mom.

69
00:06:35,357 --> 00:06:37,450
What happened to my son?

70
00:06:37,525 --> 00:06:39,390
I don't recognize
this person today.

71
00:06:39,461 --> 00:06:42,089
Then why don't you start
taking the goddamn pills?

72
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:53,433
Bitch.

73
00:07:02,252 --> 00:07:05,085
Our son just
called me a bitch.

74
00:07:07,892 --> 00:07:10,087
You're not
a bitch.

75
00:07:11,562 --> 00:07:14,998
You're bitchen,
but you're not a bitch.

76
00:07:53,441 --> 00:07:55,500
I want to be a President
of the United States

77
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:58,170
who makes sure that
we never again do business

78
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,577
with a drug-running
Panamanian dictator.

79
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:02,207
- That we never again...
- Dukakis!

80
00:08:02,317 --> 00:08:04,080
funnel aid to the Contras
through convicted drug dealers.

81
00:08:04,152 --> 00:08:05,915
Son of a bitch.

82
00:08:05,987 --> 00:08:07,477
Panama is a friendly country.

83
00:08:07,556 --> 00:08:09,990
I went down and talked
to the President of Panama...

84
00:08:10,058 --> 00:08:11,992
- Tell him, George!
- about cleaning up

85
00:08:12,061 --> 00:08:15,224
their money laundering.
And Mr. Noriega was there,

86
00:08:15,298 --> 00:08:17,266
but there was no evidence
at that time.

87
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:20,166
When the evidence was there,
we indicted him.

88
00:08:23,306 --> 00:08:25,240
Gruff voice:
Wake up.

89
00:08:47,065 --> 00:08:50,557
Voice:
I've been watching you.

90
00:09:16,798 --> 00:09:19,323
Come closer.

91
00:09:28,911 --> 00:09:30,776
Closer.

92
00:09:54,772 --> 00:09:56,364
28 days...

93
00:09:58,175 --> 00:10:00,166
six hours...

94
00:10:00,244 --> 00:10:03,270
42 minutes...

95
00:10:03,347 --> 00:10:06,009
12 seconds.

96
00:10:11,056 --> 00:10:13,786
That is
when the world

97
00:10:13,892 --> 00:10:15,951
will end.

98
00:10:16,061 --> 00:10:18,222
Why?

99
00:10:20,032 --> 00:10:21,932
(static buzz)

100
00:10:32,646 --> 00:10:35,376
(car engine rumbles)

101
00:10:50,331 --> 00:10:52,356
(crash)

102
00:10:59,675 --> 00:11:01,199
(car alarms blaring)

103
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,875
(Elizabeth breathing)

104
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,695
Son?

105
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:24,961
Son.
Donnie Darko?

106
00:11:25,036 --> 00:11:27,436
Donnie Darko.

107
00:11:27,505 --> 00:11:28,972
What the heck's
going on here?

108
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,270
- Who is it?
- It's Eddie Darko's kid.

109
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:33,674
I'm sorry about this, Jim.
He's a neighborhood kid.

110
00:11:35,246 --> 00:11:37,009
Guess he was
sleep-golfing?

111
00:11:37,082 --> 00:11:38,515
(laughing)

112
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,414
Watch out
for that drool spot.

113
00:11:43,822 --> 00:11:45,756
Jim:
Are you all right, son?

114
00:11:52,198 --> 00:11:55,531
So, let's stay off
the links at night, okay?

115
00:11:57,136 --> 00:11:59,036
Donnie:
I'm sorry, Dr. Fisher.

116
00:11:59,105 --> 00:12:01,096
It won't happen again.

117
00:12:01,174 --> 00:12:03,108
Dr. Fisher:
I hate kids.

118
00:12:03,177 --> 00:12:04,701
Jim:
Let's golf.

119
00:12:04,778 --> 00:12:06,769
(siren blast)

120
00:12:06,847 --> 00:12:08,906
Firefighter:
Let's go, fire it up!

121
00:12:11,685 --> 00:12:13,915
Woman:
Donnie, Donnie, Donnie!

122
00:12:13,988 --> 00:12:16,957
What happened
to your house?

123
00:12:19,194 --> 00:12:21,355
- No one's allowed.
- This is my house.

124
00:12:21,429 --> 00:12:23,260
- I said--
- This is my house!

125
00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:26,633
He's okay.

126
00:12:31,841 --> 00:12:34,071
Reporter:
...Channel 6 News.

127
00:12:34,143 --> 00:12:36,771
We have just arrived
on the scene...

128
00:12:50,994 --> 00:12:52,484
Wait a minute.

129
00:12:52,562 --> 00:12:54,894
Here's your brother.

130
00:12:54,966 --> 00:12:57,059
It fell in your room.

131
00:12:57,168 --> 00:12:59,659
Watch yourself
down there!

132
00:13:17,022 --> 00:13:19,957
Ms. Darko,
I'm Bob Garland.

133
00:13:20,026 --> 00:13:21,789
I'm with
the F.A.A.

134
00:13:21,861 --> 00:13:24,989
- The what?!
- I'm with the F.A.A.

135
00:13:25,065 --> 00:13:27,795
We'd like to speak to you
and your husband privately.

136
00:13:27,867 --> 00:13:29,892
- In private?
- Please.

137
00:13:31,271 --> 00:13:32,738
Rose:
All right.

138
00:13:48,657 --> 00:13:50,955
And... here.

139
00:13:51,026 --> 00:13:53,256
- You got it.
- All right.

140
00:13:53,328 --> 00:13:56,126
We have arranged for you
to stay at a hotel.

141
00:13:56,198 --> 00:13:58,996
Get some sleep and we will
take care of things here.

142
00:13:59,068 --> 00:14:01,059
- Great.
- Thank you.

143
00:14:01,137 --> 00:14:03,503
Eddie: Kids, come on,
we're going to a hotel.

144
00:14:03,606 --> 00:14:05,904
They don't know
where it came from.

145
00:14:06,008 --> 00:14:07,498
Firefighter #1 :
That's good! Right there.

146
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,475
Just leave it.

147
00:14:09,545 --> 00:14:11,376
Firefighter #2: Yeah,
just tying it off right now.

148
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:22,857
Reporter: Local and national
transportation authorities

149
00:14:22,926 --> 00:14:24,518
have begun
a nationwide search...

150
00:14:24,596 --> 00:14:26,257
Frankie Feedler.

151
00:14:26,331 --> 00:14:28,856
...despite the fact
that no airline will claim...

152
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:31,128
You remember him?

153
00:14:31,202 --> 00:14:33,670
From high school.

154
00:14:33,738 --> 00:14:36,707
Reporter: The F.A.A. remained
tight-lipped on the details

155
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,606
of the current situation.

156
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,111
He died.

157
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,307
Reporter: The engine,
which appears to have detached...

158
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:47,351
On his way to the prom.
Remember?

159
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,082
They said
he was doomed.

160
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:59,923
Jesus.

161
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:04,260
They could have said
the same thing about Donnie.

162
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:08,868
(TV news continues)

163
00:15:08,943 --> 00:15:11,468
If it fell
from a plane,

164
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:14,548
then what happened
to the plane?

165
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:17,140
They don't know,
Samantha.

166
00:15:27,095 --> 00:15:29,825
Rose: Mrs. Farmer will
bring you home after practice.

167
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:31,764
- Bye, Mommy!
- Bye, honey.

168
00:15:31,834 --> 00:15:34,530
Rose:
Donnie, good luck.

169
00:15:34,604 --> 00:15:37,300
Oh, my God!
Okay, tell me everything.

170
00:15:37,373 --> 00:15:40,308
- I'm not allowed to talk about it.
- Oh, my God.

171
00:15:40,377 --> 00:15:42,902
- Hi, Cherita.
- Shut up!

172
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,948
Darko cheats death!

173
00:15:46,016 --> 00:15:48,177
You're like
a celebrity.

174
00:15:48,285 --> 00:15:50,185
I've been calling you
a jillion times.

175
00:15:50,254 --> 00:15:52,119
- Where you been?
- We stayed at a hotel.

176
00:15:52,189 --> 00:15:54,316
My dad said he saw you
at the golf course.

177
00:15:54,392 --> 00:15:56,326
You sleepwalking
again, buddy?

178
00:15:56,394 --> 00:15:57,884
I don't want
to talk about it.

179
00:15:57,963 --> 00:15:59,954
Boy #2:
And now that you're famous,

180
00:16:00,031 --> 00:16:01,965
you gotta have
a smoke.

181
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:08,295
What happens if you tell
Mom and Dad about this, Sam?

182
00:16:08,374 --> 00:16:11,070
You'll put Ariel
in the garbage disposal.

183
00:16:11,143 --> 00:16:13,634
Goddamn right,
I will.

184
00:16:13,713 --> 00:16:15,203
Schoolgirl:
So grotty.

185
00:16:15,281 --> 00:16:17,476
Boy #1 : Hey, Cherita,
you want a cigarette?

186
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:20,313
- Chut up!
- Chut up!

187
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,014
Go back to China,
bitch!

188
00:16:25,692 --> 00:16:27,660
Just leave her
alone.

189
00:16:27,728 --> 00:16:29,218
Boy #1 :
That's some good shit, huh?

190
00:16:29,296 --> 00:16:31,628
Donnie:
It's a fucking cigarette.

191
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,998
(tower bell rings)

192
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:10,899
# I wanted to be
with you alone

193
00:17:12,743 --> 00:17:16,270
# And talk
about the weather

194
00:17:16,347 --> 00:17:18,542
# But traditions
I can trace

195
00:17:18,616 --> 00:17:21,050
# Against the child
in your face

196
00:17:22,386 --> 00:17:24,786
# Won't escape
my attention

197
00:17:26,992 --> 00:17:31,725
# You keep your distance
via the system of touch

198
00:17:32,931 --> 00:17:35,195
# And gentle persuasion

199
00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:38,828
# With one foot
in the past

200
00:17:38,905 --> 00:17:41,237
# Now just how long
will it last?

201
00:17:41,307 --> 00:17:43,241
# No, no, no

202
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:45,743
# Have you no ambition?

203
00:17:47,313 --> 00:17:51,647
# You keep your distance
via the system of touch

204
00:17:53,087 --> 00:17:55,715
# And gentle persuasion

205
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:59,156
# I'm lost in admiration

206
00:17:59,259 --> 00:18:01,284
# Could I need you
this much?

207
00:18:01,396 --> 00:18:04,331
# Oh, you're wasting
my time

208
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:07,368
# You're, just, just,
just wasting time

209
00:18:07,435 --> 00:18:10,962
# Something happens
and I'm head over heels

210
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,633
# I never find out

211
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:17,542
# Till I'm head over heels

212
00:18:17,613 --> 00:18:21,709
# Something happens,
and I'm head over heels

213
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:24,651
# Ah, don't take my heart,
don't break my heart

214
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,417
# Don't-- don't--
don't throw it away

215
00:18:46,644 --> 00:18:52,640
# In my mind's eye

216
00:18:52,718 --> 00:18:57,485
# One little boy...
one little man

217
00:18:57,556 --> 00:19:00,354
# Funny how...

218
00:19:00,426 --> 00:19:03,190
# Time...

219
00:19:03,262 --> 00:19:05,924
# Flies.

220
00:19:06,032 --> 00:19:08,000
"There would be headlines
in the papers.

221
00:19:08,067 --> 00:19:10,592
Even the grown-up gangs
who ran the betting

222
00:19:10,703 --> 00:19:11,931
at the all-in wrestling

223
00:19:12,005 --> 00:19:13,632
and the barrow-boys
would hear with respect

224
00:19:13,706 --> 00:19:16,436
of how Old Misery's house
had been destroyed.

225
00:19:17,644 --> 00:19:20,010
It was as though
this plan had been

226
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,571
with him all his life,
pondered through the seasons,

227
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:26,347
now in his 1 5th year
crystallized

228
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,354
with the pain of puberty."

229
00:19:31,226 --> 00:19:33,820
What is Graham Greene
trying to communicate

230
00:19:33,895 --> 00:19:35,886
with this passage?

231
00:19:35,964 --> 00:19:38,194
Why did the children
break into Old Misery's house?

232
00:19:39,734 --> 00:19:42,794
- Joanie?
- They wanted to rob him.

233
00:19:42,904 --> 00:19:45,839
Joanie, if you had actually
read the short story,

234
00:19:45,942 --> 00:19:48,911
which, at a whopping 13 pages
would have kept you up all night,

235
00:19:48,978 --> 00:19:51,674
- you would know that the children...
- You suck.

236
00:19:51,747 --> 00:19:53,510
...find a great deal
of money in the mattress,

237
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:54,845
but they burn it.

238
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,654
Donnie Darko,

239
00:20:00,724 --> 00:20:03,386
perhaps with your recent brush
with mass destruction,

240
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,018
you can give us
your opinion.

241
00:20:05,095 --> 00:20:09,259
They say it right
when they flood the house

242
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,960
and they tear it
to shreds,

243
00:20:11,069 --> 00:20:13,367
that destruction
is a form of creation.

244
00:20:13,471 --> 00:20:16,907
So the fact that they
burn the money is ironic.

245
00:20:16,975 --> 00:20:19,773
They just want to see what happens
when they tear the world apart.

246
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:22,842
They want to change things.

247
00:20:29,588 --> 00:20:31,283
May we help you?

248
00:20:31,357 --> 00:20:33,291
Yeah, I just registered

249
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:35,327
and they put me
in the wrong English class.

250
00:20:35,395 --> 00:20:37,761
You look like
you belong here.

251
00:20:39,466 --> 00:20:41,366
Where do I sit?

252
00:20:44,538 --> 00:20:47,564
Sit next to the boy
you think is the cutest.

253
00:20:47,674 --> 00:20:49,699
- (students murmur)
- Quiet!

254
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,539
Let her choose.

255
00:21:12,534 --> 00:21:14,331
Joanie, get up.

256
00:21:37,695 --> 00:21:39,629
The construction guys
say it will take

257
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,563
about a week
to fix the roof.

258
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,295
That damned airline better not
fuck us on the shingle match.

259
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,064
They still don't know?

260
00:21:47,138 --> 00:21:50,835
- Know what?
- Where it came from.

261
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:54,070
No. Apparently they can't
tell us what happened yet.

262
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,080
Something about...

263
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,083
a matching serial number
that got burned.

264
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:01,619
I had to sign a form saying
I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.

265
00:22:04,357 --> 00:22:06,348
So, we're not supposed
to tell anyone

266
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:09,554
- what nobody knows?
- Yeah.

267
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,495
But, you tell--

268
00:22:11,565 --> 00:22:14,329
What's your doctor's name?

269
00:22:14,401 --> 00:22:16,164
- Dr. Thurman, Dad.
- Yes.

270
00:22:16,236 --> 00:22:18,704
You tell Dr. Thurman
whatever you want.

271
00:22:20,475 --> 00:22:21,840
- Dad?
- What?

272
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:23,570
Dad!

273
00:22:46,703 --> 00:22:48,830
No mail today.
Maybe tomorrow.

274
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:54,400
(whispering)

275
00:23:05,489 --> 00:23:08,287
Well?
What did she say to you?

276
00:23:14,933 --> 00:23:16,560
I made a new friend.

277
00:23:16,635 --> 00:23:18,535
Real or imaginary?

278
00:23:18,603 --> 00:23:20,400
Imaginary.

279
00:23:20,472 --> 00:23:22,372
Would you like to talk
about this friend?

280
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:25,673
- Frank.
- Frank.

281
00:23:25,745 --> 00:23:28,612
- What did Frank say?
- He said to follow him.

282
00:23:28,681 --> 00:23:31,241
- Follow him?  Where?
- Into the future.

283
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,910
And then what happens?

284
00:23:36,056 --> 00:23:38,251
And then he said...

285
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:43,022
Then he said that the world
was coming to an end.

286
00:23:43,097 --> 00:23:45,361
Do you think the world
is coming to an end?

287
00:23:50,205 --> 00:23:51,638
No.

288
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:56,172
That's stupid.

289
00:23:57,746 --> 00:24:01,910
Woman: For my entire life,
I was a victim of my own fear.

290
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:04,919
Love.

291
00:24:06,021 --> 00:24:09,184
Woman: I was feeding
fear through food.

292
00:24:12,762 --> 00:24:14,354
Fear.

293
00:24:21,905 --> 00:24:24,203
And finally, I looked
in the mirror.

294
00:24:24,274 --> 00:24:26,902
Not just in the mirror...

295
00:24:26,978 --> 00:24:29,310
I looked through
the mirror.

296
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,371
In that image,

297
00:24:31,449 --> 00:24:33,383
I saw my ego reflection.

298
00:24:36,687 --> 00:24:38,655
For two years,
I thought it was normal

299
00:24:38,723 --> 00:24:41,191
for a 1 0-year-old
to wet the bed.

300
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,194
- We tried everything.
- Shh!

301
00:24:43,262 --> 00:24:44,752
Teacher:
Quiet!

302
00:24:46,899 --> 00:24:49,834
But the solution
was there all the time.

303
00:24:50,903 --> 00:24:52,871
I'm not afraid anymore!

304
00:24:54,707 --> 00:24:56,572
All over America,

305
00:24:56,643 --> 00:24:59,134
people have come together
to join hands.

306
00:24:59,212 --> 00:25:01,373
People who believe

307
00:25:01,447 --> 00:25:03,677
that human life

308
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,514
is absolutely too important,

309
00:25:06,587 --> 00:25:08,487
too valuable,

310
00:25:08,556 --> 00:25:11,889
and too precious
to be controlled by fear.

311
00:25:15,629 --> 00:25:18,655
Hello, my name
is Jim Cunningham.

312
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,735
And welcome
to "Controlling Fear."

313
00:25:32,682 --> 00:25:34,912
Frank:
Wake up, Donnie.

314
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:14,854
"And the prince was led
into a world

315
00:26:14,927 --> 00:26:17,452
of strange
and beautiful magic."

316
00:26:17,563 --> 00:26:19,497
Girl: Hey, you guys,
guess what?!

317
00:26:19,565 --> 00:26:21,260
I can't
believe this!

318
00:26:22,636 --> 00:26:24,297
My mom said the school
is closed today

319
00:26:24,371 --> 00:26:26,566
- because it's flooded.
- No way.

320
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,699
- Yeah.
- Holy shit!

321
00:26:28,775 --> 00:26:30,675
That's the best news
I've ever heard!

322
00:26:36,817 --> 00:26:39,945
Principal: My God, is this
ever going to stop?

323
00:26:40,021 --> 00:26:41,989
Eventually,
yes it will.

324
00:26:42,056 --> 00:26:45,253
But right now I got
1 2 classrooms full of water,

325
00:26:45,326 --> 00:26:47,658
all coming from
a busted water main.

326
00:26:47,729 --> 00:26:50,630
- What else?
- What else?!

327
00:26:50,699 --> 00:26:54,032
Principal Cole,
I'll show you what else.

328
00:26:57,306 --> 00:26:59,206
Security guard:
That's unbelievable.

329
00:26:59,274 --> 00:27:00,901
That's solid bronze,
isn't it?

330
00:27:00,977 --> 00:27:03,002
- Yep.
- How did this happen?

331
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,910
Beth's mom said
the boys' locker room

332
00:27:04,981 --> 00:27:07,449
was flooded and they found
feces everywhere.

333
00:27:07,517 --> 00:27:09,712
- What are feces?
- Baby mice.

334
00:27:09,786 --> 00:27:10,650
Aw-ww...

335
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,508
Hey...

336
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:34,976
Has anyone ever told you
that you're sexy?

337
00:27:35,046 --> 00:27:37,844
I like
your boobs.

338
00:27:37,916 --> 00:27:39,474
Hey.

339
00:27:39,552 --> 00:27:41,486
Hey.

340
00:27:42,722 --> 00:27:44,656
School was cancelled.

341
00:27:46,525 --> 00:27:48,117
Do you want
to walk me home?

342
00:27:48,194 --> 00:27:50,458
Sure.

343
00:28:00,407 --> 00:28:02,466
- Don't look so freaked.
- I'm not.

344
00:28:02,576 --> 00:28:05,010
You should check
your backpack,

345
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:07,172
those guys love
to steal shit.

346
00:28:10,251 --> 00:28:12,151
So, why did you
move here?

347
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,154
My parents
got a divorce.

348
00:28:14,222 --> 00:28:16,782
My mom had to get a restraining
order against my stepdad.

349
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:20,317
- He has emotional problems.
- I have those, too.

350
00:28:20,396 --> 00:28:23,160
What kind of emotional problems
does your dad have?

351
00:28:23,232 --> 00:28:25,928
He stabbed my mom
four times in the chest.

352
00:28:27,102 --> 00:28:28,797
Oh.

353
00:28:28,871 --> 00:28:30,805
Did he go
to jail?

354
00:28:30,874 --> 00:28:34,332
No, he fled.
They still can't find him.

355
00:28:34,411 --> 00:28:36,538
But my mom and I
had to change our names.

356
00:28:36,646 --> 00:28:39,046
And I thought "Gretchen Ross"
was really cool.

357
00:28:39,115 --> 00:28:42,949
I was in jail once.
I mean...

358
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,954
I accidentally
burned down this house.

359
00:28:45,022 --> 00:28:47,013
It was abandoned,
but still,

360
00:28:47,091 --> 00:28:50,549
I got held back in school
and I can't drive until I'm 21.

361
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:52,789
But I'm over
all of that.

362
00:28:54,298 --> 00:28:56,732
I'm painting
and stuff.

363
00:28:56,802 --> 00:28:59,134
Writing.
I want to be a writer

364
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:01,035
or maybe a painter,
or maybe both.

365
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:04,337
I'll write a book
and draw the pictures.

366
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,707
Then maybe people
will understand me.

367
00:29:06,812 --> 00:29:08,803
I don't know,
change things.

368
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:11,907
"Donnie Darko"?  What the hell
kind of name is that?

369
00:29:12,018 --> 00:29:14,350
It's like some sort
of superhero or something.

370
00:29:15,721 --> 00:29:17,780
What makes you think I'm not?

371
00:29:21,995 --> 00:29:24,122
I should go.

372
00:29:24,198 --> 00:29:27,224
For physics, Monnitoff is having
me write this essay...

373
00:29:27,301 --> 00:29:29,826
"Greatest invention
ever to benefit mankind."

374
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,874
It's Monnitoff.
But that's easy.

375
00:29:34,943 --> 00:29:36,740
Antiseptics.

376
00:29:36,811 --> 00:29:39,075
The whole
sanitation thing.

377
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,114
Joseph Lister, 1895.

378
00:29:41,182 --> 00:29:43,548
Before antiseptics,
there was no sanitation,

379
00:29:43,618 --> 00:29:45,449
especially
in medicine.

380
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,078
You mean, soap?

381
00:29:53,929 --> 00:29:56,489
Well, I'm really glad
school was flooded today.

382
00:29:56,565 --> 00:29:58,556
Why is that?

383
00:29:59,636 --> 00:30:02,434
Because you and I would have
never had this conversation.

384
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,770
You're weird.

385
00:30:06,843 --> 00:30:08,470
Sorry.

386
00:30:08,545 --> 00:30:10,570
No, that was
a compliment.

387
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:16,350
Well, look...

388
00:30:19,223 --> 00:30:21,157
you want to go
with me?

389
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,994
Where do you want
to go?

390
00:30:25,063 --> 00:30:27,759
No, I mean, like,
"go" with me.

391
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:30,529
It's what
we call it here.

392
00:30:30,602 --> 00:30:32,160
- "Going together."
- Sure.

393
00:30:35,874 --> 00:30:37,808
Okay.
Where are you going?

394
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,340
I'm going home.

395
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,853
So stupid!

396
00:30:49,923 --> 00:30:51,788
"Where are you going?  "

397
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,330
I'd like to try
something new this time.

398
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:06,966
Have you ever been
hypnotized?

399
00:31:08,043 --> 00:31:09,670
No.

400
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,955
And when I clap
my hands twice,

401
00:31:21,023 --> 00:31:23,389
you will wake up.
Do you understand?

402
00:31:23,459 --> 00:31:25,893
Yes.

403
00:31:25,995 --> 00:31:29,123
So... tell me
about your week.

404
00:31:29,199 --> 00:31:31,326
I met a girl.

405
00:31:33,904 --> 00:31:35,872
What is her name?

406
00:31:35,939 --> 00:31:38,430
Gretchen.

407
00:31:38,508 --> 00:31:41,841
We're going together now.

408
00:31:43,648 --> 00:31:46,845
Do you still think
about girls a lot?

409
00:31:46,918 --> 00:31:49,216
Yeah.

410
00:31:51,956 --> 00:31:54,891
How are things
going at school?

411
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,554
I think about
girls a lot.

412
00:31:57,663 --> 00:31:59,995
I asked you about school,
Donnie.

413
00:32:00,065 --> 00:32:01,726
I think about...

414
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,735
fucking a lot
during school.

415
00:32:05,804 --> 00:32:08,466
What else do you think
about during school?

416
00:32:08,541 --> 00:32:10,668
"Married With Children."

417
00:32:10,744 --> 00:32:12,974
Do you think
about your family?

418
00:32:13,046 --> 00:32:15,480
I just turn down the volume

419
00:32:15,548 --> 00:32:18,176
and think about fucking
Christina Applegate.

420
00:32:18,251 --> 00:32:20,947
I asked you about
your family, Donnie.

421
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:23,013
No.

422
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:25,854
I don't think about
fucking my family.

423
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,928
That's gross.

424
00:32:27,995 --> 00:32:30,930
I'd like to hear
about your friend, Frank.

425
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:49,983
Principal:
Sam Bylen?

426
00:32:51,287 --> 00:32:53,050
Ahem.

427
00:32:54,791 --> 00:32:56,759
(writing on blackboard)

428
00:33:07,738 --> 00:33:09,672
Donald Darko.

429
00:33:31,831 --> 00:33:34,800
Principal:
Daye Dennis.

430
00:33:36,302 --> 00:33:37,599
(toilet flushing)

431
00:33:40,307 --> 00:33:42,798
Hey, you fuck!

432
00:33:42,876 --> 00:33:45,401
Did you tell them that
I flooded the school?

433
00:33:47,581 --> 00:33:49,344
I didn't say shit.

434
00:33:49,416 --> 00:33:51,611
That's not what I heard.
They think I did it.

435
00:33:51,686 --> 00:33:53,244
Yeah, well,
if you're innocent,

436
00:33:53,321 --> 00:33:55,448
then you have nothing
to worry about, right?

437
00:33:56,524 --> 00:33:58,424
Fuck you!
You know what I think?

438
00:33:58,493 --> 00:34:00,222
(knife clicks)

439
00:34:00,294 --> 00:34:02,023
I think you did it.

440
00:34:02,096 --> 00:34:03,825
(Donnie coughing)

441
00:34:07,736 --> 00:34:09,226
(coughing)

442
00:34:14,543 --> 00:34:14,743
(rifleshot)

443
00:34:14,743 --> 00:34:15,607
(rifleshot)

444
00:34:17,881 --> 00:34:20,816
Ronald: Beer and pussy,
that's all I need.

445
00:34:20,884 --> 00:34:23,148
Sean: We gotta
find ourselves a Smurfette.

446
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:24,652
Smurfette?

447
00:34:24,721 --> 00:34:26,154
Mm-hmm.

448
00:34:26,222 --> 00:34:28,918
Not some, like, tight-ass,
Middlesex chick, you know?

449
00:34:28,993 --> 00:34:30,290
Like this cute little blonde,

450
00:34:30,361 --> 00:34:32,556
that will get down
and dirty with the guys.

451
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:35,690
- Like Smurfette does.
- Donnie: Smurfette doesn't fuck.

452
00:34:35,766 --> 00:34:37,859
(cocks rifle, fires)

453
00:34:37,935 --> 00:34:39,527
Sean:
That's bullshit.

454
00:34:39,637 --> 00:34:41,298
Smurfette fucks
all the other Smurfs.

455
00:34:41,405 --> 00:34:42,963
Why do you think
Papa Smurf made her?

456
00:34:43,074 --> 00:34:45,406
Because all the other Smurfs
were getting too horny.

457
00:34:45,477 --> 00:34:46,876
No, no, no,
not "Vanity."

458
00:34:46,945 --> 00:34:48,378
I heard he was
a homosexual.

459
00:34:48,447 --> 00:34:49,880
Okay, well,
you know what?

460
00:34:49,948 --> 00:34:52,439
Then, she fucks them
while Vanity watches. Okay?

461
00:34:52,517 --> 00:34:54,280
What about
Papa Smurf?

462
00:34:54,353 --> 00:34:56,685
He must get in
on the action.

463
00:34:56,756 --> 00:34:59,418
Yeah, what he does,
he films the gang-bang.

464
00:34:59,492 --> 00:35:02,290
Later on, he beats off
to the tape.

465
00:35:03,362 --> 00:35:04,886
First of all,

466
00:35:04,964 --> 00:35:07,228
Papa Smurf didn't
create Smurfette.

467
00:35:07,301 --> 00:35:09,826
Gargamel did. She was sent
in as Gargamel's evil spy

468
00:35:09,903 --> 00:35:12,497
with the intention
of destroying the Smurf village.

469
00:35:12,606 --> 00:35:14,369
But the overwhelming
goodness

470
00:35:14,475 --> 00:35:17,171
of the Smurf way of life
transformed her.

471
00:35:17,277 --> 00:35:19,711
And as for the whole
gang-bang scenario,

472
00:35:19,813 --> 00:35:22,281
(laughs)
it just couldn't happen.

473
00:35:22,383 --> 00:35:25,819
Smurfs are asexual.
They don't even have...

474
00:35:25,887 --> 00:35:29,152
reproductive organs under
those little white pants.

475
00:35:30,925 --> 00:35:33,052
That's what's
so illogical, you know,

476
00:35:33,128 --> 00:35:35,096
about being a Smurf.

477
00:35:35,164 --> 00:35:37,098
What's the point
of living...

478
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:39,600
if you don't
have a dick?

479
00:35:42,104 --> 00:35:44,163
(sighs)
Damn it, Donnie.

480
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,208
Why do you gotta
get so smart on us?

481
00:35:47,477 --> 00:35:49,638
- (honking)
- Donnie: Grandma Death.

482
00:35:49,746 --> 00:35:52,180
Woman:
Excuse me! Excuse me!

483
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:55,577
Please stay off the road,
Miss Sparrow.

484
00:35:55,652 --> 00:35:57,119
If this happens again,

485
00:35:57,187 --> 00:35:58,848
I am going to call
Social Services.

486
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:00,458
I hate that
Mrs. Farmer.

487
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:02,926
- Watch your step. That's it.
- She's such a fucking bitch.

488
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,656
- There you are, that's a girl.
- Donnie: Yeah.

489
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:08,722
- Ronald: How old is Grandma Death?
- Donnie: 101.

490
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:12,793
She does the same thing
every day.

491
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:14,805
Just walks
back and forth

492
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:18,832
and back and forth
to the mailbox.

493
00:36:18,944 --> 00:36:21,412
Nothing
ever in there.

494
00:36:24,217 --> 00:36:25,650
Sean:
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

495
00:36:28,454 --> 00:36:31,150
She goes--
she's going back to the box.

496
00:36:31,224 --> 00:36:33,021
We may
still have mail.

497
00:36:33,092 --> 00:36:34,889
- Ronald: Mail, mail, mail.
- Sean: Here it is.

498
00:36:34,961 --> 00:36:36,690
- And...?
- This could be it.

499
00:36:36,763 --> 00:36:39,061
Oh-hhh!

500
00:36:39,133 --> 00:36:41,727
No dice, Grandma.
No, sorry. Sorry.

501
00:36:41,802 --> 00:36:43,736
Someone ought
to write that bitch.

502
00:36:43,804 --> 00:36:45,169
(loud whirring)

503
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:47,070
Reporter: Authorities
continued their search today

504
00:36:47,141 --> 00:36:49,803
for a suspect in the Middlesex
Ridge School vandalism.

505
00:36:49,878 --> 00:36:52,403
The private school has
asked for public donations

506
00:36:52,514 --> 00:36:54,209
to help restore
its beloved mascot,

507
00:36:54,316 --> 00:36:56,784
known only as "The Mongrel."
In other news--

508
00:37:01,856 --> 00:37:04,791
Principal: In cooperation
with the county police,

509
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:07,226
we have begun
an active investigation

510
00:37:07,296 --> 00:37:09,560
into the cause
of the flooding.

511
00:37:09,632 --> 00:37:13,295
And our suspects include
several of our own students--

512
00:37:13,369 --> 00:37:15,462
Mrs. Farmer: I want
to know why this filth

513
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:17,370
is being taught
to our children.

514
00:37:17,441 --> 00:37:19,170
Parent:
That's what I want to know.

515
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:22,378
(panting)

516
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,218
Kitty,
I would appreciate--

517
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,753
Man: Let her speak,
for God's sake!

518
00:37:30,855 --> 00:37:32,914
- If you would wait--
- Dr. Cole,

519
00:37:33,024 --> 00:37:34,889
not only am I a teacher,

520
00:37:34,959 --> 00:37:38,588
but I am also a parent
of a Middlesex child.

521
00:37:38,663 --> 00:37:41,223
Therefore I am
the only person here

522
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,292
who transcends
the parent-teacher bridge.

523
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:50,035
Frank:
Don't worry.

524
00:37:50,109 --> 00:37:52,669
You got away with it.

525
00:37:52,745 --> 00:37:54,235
I have in my hand

526
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:56,282
Graham Greene's
"The Destructors."

527
00:37:56,349 --> 00:37:57,941
This short story

528
00:37:58,051 --> 00:38:00,713
is part of my daughter's
English assignment.

529
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,481
Woman:
We're with you, Kitty!

530
00:38:02,589 --> 00:38:04,648
In this story,
several children

531
00:38:04,758 --> 00:38:07,750
destroy an elderly man's
house from inside out.

532
00:38:10,698 --> 00:38:13,326
(thumps)

533
00:38:20,942 --> 00:38:22,876
How can you do that?

534
00:38:24,579 --> 00:38:26,479
(thumps)

535
00:38:30,285 --> 00:38:32,185
And how do they do this?

536
00:38:32,288 --> 00:38:33,880
They flood the house

537
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:36,959
by breaking through
a water main.

538
00:38:38,728 --> 00:38:41,094
Frank:
I can do anything I want.

539
00:38:42,365 --> 00:38:44,060
And so can you.

540
00:38:44,133 --> 00:38:46,363
Parent: We pay good money
for this school.

541
00:38:46,437 --> 00:38:48,462
- It's our children!
- (applause)

542
00:38:48,539 --> 00:38:51,667
And I think that this garbage
should be removed.

543
00:38:51,742 --> 00:38:53,607
Excuse me.

544
00:38:53,677 --> 00:38:56,544
What is the real issue here?
The P.T.A. doesn't ban books.

545
00:38:56,613 --> 00:38:59,377
The P.T.A. is here
to acknowledge

546
00:38:59,451 --> 00:39:02,818
that pornography is being
taught in our curriculum!

547
00:39:02,887 --> 00:39:04,684
It's meant
to be ironic.

548
00:39:04,756 --> 00:39:07,554
Excuse me. You need
to go back to grad school.

549
00:39:08,693 --> 00:39:10,752
Why did you make me
flood the school?

550
00:39:15,301 --> 00:39:18,429
They are in great danger.

551
00:39:18,504 --> 00:39:19,994
- Woman: We have rights here!
- Kitty...

552
00:39:20,072 --> 00:39:21,835
do you even know
who Graham Greene is?

553
00:39:21,907 --> 00:39:25,399
I think we have
all seen "Bonanza."

554
00:39:25,479 --> 00:39:27,970
- (gasps)
- (scattered applause)

555
00:39:28,048 --> 00:39:29,948
Well...

556
00:39:30,016 --> 00:39:32,507
- Good work, Kitty.
- while we are on other topics...

557
00:39:32,586 --> 00:39:34,417
Where did you come from?

558
00:39:36,256 --> 00:39:38,884
Do you believe
in time travel?

559
00:39:40,728 --> 00:39:43,196
Samantha:
Who are you talking to?

560
00:39:48,002 --> 00:39:50,163
I was just taking
my pills, Sam.

561
00:40:00,349 --> 00:40:01,748
It is time
to breathe.

562
00:40:02,952 --> 00:40:05,011
Both:
Thank you, Jim Cunningham.

563
00:40:05,088 --> 00:40:07,215
Linda:
Thank you, Jim Cunningham.

564
00:40:09,259 --> 00:40:12,422
So now let us begin Life Line
Exercise Number One.

565
00:40:12,529 --> 00:40:15,089
Please press "Stop" now.

566
00:40:21,705 --> 00:40:23,605
Mrs. Farmer:
As you can see,

567
00:40:23,674 --> 00:40:25,574
the Life Line is divided

568
00:40:25,643 --> 00:40:27,611
into two polar extremes.

569
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:30,239
Fear and love.

570
00:40:30,315 --> 00:40:34,115
Fear is in the negative
energy spectrum.

571
00:40:34,186 --> 00:40:37,246
And love is in the positive
energy spectrum.

572
00:40:37,322 --> 00:40:39,347
No duh.

573
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:42,086
Excuse me?
"No duh..."

574
00:40:42,161 --> 00:40:44,186
is a product of fear.

575
00:40:45,431 --> 00:40:48,195
Now, on each card

576
00:40:48,301 --> 00:40:50,667
is a character dilemma

577
00:40:50,736 --> 00:40:53,398
which applies
to the Life Line.

578
00:40:55,108 --> 00:40:57,372
Please-- take this!

579
00:40:57,444 --> 00:40:59,275
Thank you.

580
00:40:59,346 --> 00:41:02,110
Please read each
character dilemma aloud,

581
00:41:02,182 --> 00:41:04,241
and place an "X"

582
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:07,048
on the Life Line
in the appropriate place.

583
00:41:07,121 --> 00:41:09,055
Cherita?

584
00:41:17,832 --> 00:41:20,062
"Juanita has an important
math test today.

585
00:41:20,169 --> 00:41:22,660
She has known about the test
for several weeks,

586
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:25,001
but has not studied.

587
00:41:25,074 --> 00:41:28,441
In order to keep
from failing her class

588
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:30,444
Juanita decides
that she will

589
00:41:30,512 --> 00:41:32,537
cheat on the math test."

590
00:41:35,552 --> 00:41:38,146
Good, good.
Very good.

591
00:41:38,221 --> 00:41:39,711
Mr. Darko.

592
00:41:47,865 --> 00:41:50,390
"Ling Ling finds a wallet
on the ground filled with money.

593
00:41:50,468 --> 00:41:52,959
She takes the wallet to the address
on the driver's license

594
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:55,834
but keeps the money inside
the wallet."

595
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,339
(scoffs)

596
00:41:57,409 --> 00:41:59,809
I-I'm sorry, Mrs. Farmer.
I don't get this.

597
00:41:59,878 --> 00:42:01,573
Just place an "X"
on the Life Line

598
00:42:01,647 --> 00:42:02,944
in the appropriate place.

599
00:42:03,015 --> 00:42:06,451
Donnie: No. I know what to do.
I just-- I don't get this.

600
00:42:06,518 --> 00:42:08,383
You can't lump things
into two categories.

601
00:42:08,453 --> 00:42:09,943
Things aren't that simple.

602
00:42:10,022 --> 00:42:12,217
The Life Line is
divided that way.

603
00:42:12,292 --> 00:42:14,692
Life isn't that simple.

604
00:42:14,761 --> 00:42:17,161
I mean, who cares
if Ling Ling

605
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:19,528
returns the wallet
and keeps the money?

606
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:21,726
It has nothing to do
with either fear or love.

607
00:42:21,801 --> 00:42:24,463
Fear and love are the deepest
of human emotions.

608
00:42:24,538 --> 00:42:27,098
Okay. But you're
not listening to me.

609
00:42:27,207 --> 00:42:30,335
There are other things that
need to be taken into account.

610
00:42:30,444 --> 00:42:32,639
Like the whole spectrum
of human emotion.

611
00:42:32,713 --> 00:42:35,807
You can't just lump everything
into these two categories

612
00:42:35,884 --> 00:42:37,749
and then just deny
everything else.

613
00:42:37,819 --> 00:42:39,878
If you don't complete
the assignment,

614
00:42:39,955 --> 00:42:42,082
you'll get a zero
for the day.

615
00:42:46,995 --> 00:42:48,860
Principal:
Donald...

616
00:42:48,931 --> 00:42:50,990
Iet me preface this
by saying

617
00:42:51,067 --> 00:42:53,535
that your Iowa Test
scores are...

618
00:42:53,602 --> 00:42:56,070
intimidating.

619
00:42:58,207 --> 00:43:00,141
So...

620
00:43:00,242 --> 00:43:02,233
Iet's go over
this again.

621
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:05,645
What exactly did you say
to Mrs. Farmer?

622
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,715
Mrs. Farmer:
I'll tell you what he said.

623
00:43:09,786 --> 00:43:11,617
He asked me
to forcibly insert

624
00:43:11,688 --> 00:43:13,986
the Life Line exercise card
into my anus!

625
00:43:14,057 --> 00:43:16,355
(Eddie snickers, coughs)

626
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:22,991
Woman:
These are modern times.

627
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:25,035
My political attitudes
are forthright.

628
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:27,503
And if there's
a Vice-Presidential candidate

629
00:43:27,573 --> 00:43:30,371
worthy of my vote,
it has to be Dan Quayle.

630
00:43:30,442 --> 00:43:32,967
Mrs. Farmer: Nobody cares
about responsibility,

631
00:43:33,078 --> 00:43:34,978
morality, family values.

632
00:43:35,047 --> 00:43:36,742
Mm-hmm.

633
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:39,347
(sighs)

634
00:43:39,418 --> 00:43:41,443
Kitty...

635
00:43:41,554 --> 00:43:43,317
Excuse us, please.

636
00:43:47,527 --> 00:43:50,360
They've suspended him
from afterschool activities

637
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:52,398
for the next six months.

638
00:43:55,136 --> 00:43:56,967
Ever since
this jet engine fiasco,

639
00:43:57,038 --> 00:43:59,438
I honestly don't know
what's gotten into him--

640
00:43:59,507 --> 00:44:01,372
Rose, I'll tell you this
because our daughters

641
00:44:01,442 --> 00:44:03,672
have been on the dance team
together for two years,

642
00:44:03,744 --> 00:44:05,575
and I respect you
as a woman.

643
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,274
But after witnessing your son's
behavior this afternoon,

644
00:44:08,383 --> 00:44:10,374
I have significant
doubts about your--

645
00:44:12,888 --> 00:44:15,721
Our paths through life
must be righteous.

646
00:44:15,791 --> 00:44:18,555
I urge you to go home
and look in the mirror,

647
00:44:18,628 --> 00:44:22,564
and pray that your son doesn't
succumb to the path of fear.

648
00:44:27,637 --> 00:44:30,504
Elizabeth:
Wait. Do you remember

649
00:44:30,573 --> 00:44:32,871
that weird gym teacher,
Mrs. Farmer?

650
00:44:34,411 --> 00:44:36,971
Yeah. Okay, well,
my brother

651
00:44:37,047 --> 00:44:39,413
told her to shove
a book up her ass today.

652
00:44:39,516 --> 00:44:42,883
And then my parents just
bought him all this new shit.

653
00:44:43,987 --> 00:44:47,616
Yeah, I know. I wish a jet engine
would fall in my room.

654
00:44:50,829 --> 00:44:53,195
Frank:
I can show you the way.

655
00:44:54,466 --> 00:44:56,593
(bells ringing)

656
00:45:05,878 --> 00:45:08,608
- Donnie: Dr. Monnitoff?
- Donnie.

657
00:45:08,681 --> 00:45:11,514
I know this is gonna sound
kind of weird,

658
00:45:11,585 --> 00:45:14,645
but... do you know
anything about...

659
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:16,619
time travel?

660
00:45:20,994 --> 00:45:24,430
Dr. Monnitoff: Ah, a wormhole with
an Einstein-Rosen bridge,

661
00:45:24,499 --> 00:45:26,262
which is...

662
00:45:26,334 --> 00:45:28,359
theoretically,
a wormhole in space

663
00:45:28,436 --> 00:45:30,267
controlled by man.

664
00:45:32,573 --> 00:45:34,803
So, according to Hawking,

665
00:45:34,876 --> 00:45:38,107
a wormhole may be able
to provide a shortcut

666
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:41,377
for jumping between two distant
regions of space-time.

667
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:44,977
In order to travel back in time,
you have to have a big spaceship

668
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:47,078
or something that can travel
faster than the speed of light?

669
00:45:47,189 --> 00:45:48,747
- Theoretically.
- And be able to find

670
00:45:48,825 --> 00:45:49,291
one of these wormholes?

671
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:52,624
The basic principles
of time travel are there.

672
00:45:52,695 --> 00:45:53,923
You've got your vessel
and your portal,

673
00:45:53,997 --> 00:45:56,192
and your vessel could be
just about anything,

674
00:45:56,266 --> 00:45:58,826
- most likely a spacecraft.
- Like a DeLorean?

675
00:45:58,902 --> 00:46:00,597
Metal craft
of any kind.

676
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:02,604
You know, I love that movie,
the way they shot it.

677
00:46:02,673 --> 00:46:04,072
It's so...

678
00:46:04,141 --> 00:46:05,938
Iike futuristic,
you know?

679
00:46:07,912 --> 00:46:09,379
Listen...

680
00:46:09,446 --> 00:46:11,710
Don't tell anybody
that I gave you this.

681
00:46:11,782 --> 00:46:14,342
The woman who wrote this
used to teach here.

682
00:46:14,419 --> 00:46:17,786
She was a nun many years
before that, but...

683
00:46:17,856 --> 00:46:20,620
then overnight,
she just--

684
00:46:20,725 --> 00:46:23,125
she became this
entirely different person.

685
00:46:23,195 --> 00:46:25,322
She up and left the church,
she wrote this book.

686
00:46:26,531 --> 00:46:29,295
She started
teaching science,

687
00:46:29,368 --> 00:46:30,960
right here in Middlesex.

688
00:46:31,037 --> 00:46:34,063
"The Philosophy
of Time Travel."

689
00:46:35,341 --> 00:46:36,831
Roberta Sparrow?

690
00:46:36,909 --> 00:46:39,002
That's right.

691
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:42,739
(chuckles)
Come on.

692
00:46:42,816 --> 00:46:44,841
Roberta Sparrow?

693
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:06,732
Roberta Sparrow.

694
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:10,408
"Grandma Death."

695
00:47:11,547 --> 00:47:14,243
It's called "The Philosophy
of Time Travel."

696
00:47:15,451 --> 00:47:17,885
What does philosophy
have to do with time travel?

697
00:47:17,954 --> 00:47:20,115
- Let me see.
- Donnie: Guess who wrote it.

698
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:21,714
Who?

699
00:47:21,791 --> 00:47:23,850
Roberta Sparrow?!

700
00:47:23,927 --> 00:47:26,054
Huh. She wrote a book.

701
00:47:26,162 --> 00:47:29,063
"Grandma Death"
wrote a book.

702
00:47:29,132 --> 00:47:31,100
That's a terrible
nickname.

703
00:47:31,202 --> 00:47:34,194
We almost hit her
with the car the other day.

704
00:47:35,473 --> 00:47:37,998
She lives up there
in that piece of crap house

705
00:47:38,075 --> 00:47:40,009
and you know
she's loaded. She's--

706
00:47:40,077 --> 00:47:41,772
Eddie:
Yeah, you're right.

707
00:47:41,846 --> 00:47:44,815
She used to be known
for her gem collection.

708
00:47:44,883 --> 00:47:47,147
Kids...

709
00:47:47,219 --> 00:47:49,585
used to go up there
all the time

710
00:47:49,655 --> 00:47:51,623
and try to steal stuff
from her.

711
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:53,453
She became
a total recluse.

712
00:47:53,525 --> 00:47:56,892
Huh-- I didn't even know
she was alive

713
00:47:56,963 --> 00:47:59,591
till we damn near knocked
her down the other day.

714
00:48:02,435 --> 00:48:04,403
Donnie:
She was just standing there

715
00:48:04,504 --> 00:48:06,472
in the middle
of the road, frozen.

716
00:48:06,572 --> 00:48:08,472
So I got out of the car

717
00:48:08,541 --> 00:48:11,408
and I walked over to her
to see if she was okay.

718
00:48:11,478 --> 00:48:14,003
And she leaned over
and whispered in my ear.

719
00:48:14,081 --> 00:48:15,776
What did she say?

720
00:48:15,849 --> 00:48:17,942
I think Frank wants me
to go talk to her,

721
00:48:18,018 --> 00:48:19,815
because the last time
I saw him,

722
00:48:19,887 --> 00:48:22,014
he asked me if I knew
about time travel.

723
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:23,990
She wrote a book
about it,

724
00:48:24,059 --> 00:48:25,686
so that can't be
a coincidence, right?

725
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:31,121
Donnie, what did
Roberta Sparrow say to you?

726
00:48:33,068 --> 00:48:36,003
She said that every living
creature on Earth dies alone.

727
00:48:40,543 --> 00:48:42,909
How did that
make you feel?

728
00:48:46,782 --> 00:48:49,546
It reminded me
of my dog, Callie.

729
00:48:50,821 --> 00:48:52,789
She died
when I was eight,

730
00:48:52,856 --> 00:48:55,222
and she crawled
underneath...

731
00:48:55,292 --> 00:48:57,089
the porch.

732
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:01,793
To die?

733
00:49:04,569 --> 00:49:06,298
To be alone.

734
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:11,208
Do you feel
alone right now?

735
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,145
I don't know.

736
00:49:19,585 --> 00:49:22,281
I'd like to believe
I'm not, but I just--

737
00:49:24,056 --> 00:49:26,524
I've just never
seen any proof, so I--

738
00:49:26,593 --> 00:49:28,959
I just don't
debate it anymore, you know?

739
00:49:29,028 --> 00:49:30,859
It's like I could
spend my whole life

740
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:33,831
debating it over and over again,
weighing the pros and cons,

741
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:36,425
and in the end, I still wouldn't
have any proof. So I just--

742
00:49:36,503 --> 00:49:38,403
I just don't debate it
any more.

743
00:49:38,471 --> 00:49:40,962
(laughs)
It's absurd.

744
00:49:44,779 --> 00:49:46,974
The search for God
is absurd?

745
00:49:49,517 --> 00:49:51,712
It is if everyone
dies alone.

746
00:49:53,021 --> 00:49:54,579
Does that scare you?

747
00:49:58,059 --> 00:50:00,357
I don't want
to be alone.

748
00:50:02,431 --> 00:50:04,763
(classical music plays)

749
00:50:13,609 --> 00:50:16,373
And so his tapes
have made me realize

750
00:50:16,479 --> 00:50:18,777
that for the last
39 years,

751
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,511
I have been a prisoner
of my own fear.

752
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:23,610
Fear?

753
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:26,815
Rose, you have got
to meet this Jim Cunningham.

754
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:30,689
I can't believe
he's single.

755
00:50:31,763 --> 00:50:33,754
Announcer #1 : And it has been
a disappointing night

756
00:50:33,832 --> 00:50:35,857
indeed for these
Super Bowl champions.

757
00:50:35,934 --> 00:50:37,799
Announcer #2:
You're right, Dan.

758
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:39,632
Coach Joe Gibbs
is on the sidelines,

759
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:42,195
water dripping off his glasses,
but he's gotta be thinking,

760
00:50:42,273 --> 00:50:44,901
"What happened?
What went wrong tonight?  "

761
00:50:44,977 --> 00:50:46,410
And here's the kick...

762
00:50:46,512 --> 00:50:48,173
(men groan)

763
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,544
And it's no good.

764
00:50:50,616 --> 00:50:53,585
- Shit, we need a quarterback.
- And a miracle.

765
00:50:53,686 --> 00:50:55,950
Ronald:
We need to go for a safety.

766
00:50:57,424 --> 00:50:59,756
Announcer #1 : Mark Rypien
has some big shoes to fill,

767
00:50:59,826 --> 00:51:01,123
that's for certain.

768
00:51:01,194 --> 00:51:02,752
Announcer #2:
He sure does.

769
00:51:02,829 --> 00:51:05,730
So what the future holds
for this Super Bowl M.V.P.

770
00:51:05,799 --> 00:51:07,562
we're just gonna
have to wait and see.

771
00:51:10,304 --> 00:51:12,067
(sighs)

772
00:51:12,139 --> 00:51:13,834
- You guys want anything?
- Man: No.

773
00:51:13,908 --> 00:51:16,308
Announcer #1 : Darrell Green again
with a display of amazing speed...

774
00:51:16,377 --> 00:51:18,368
I'm gonna get a beer.

775
00:51:35,498 --> 00:51:37,125
...deep into the end zone.

776
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,225
It's gonna be brought out
to the 20-yard line.

777
00:51:39,302 --> 00:51:42,169
First down and 10.

778
00:51:42,238 --> 00:51:45,264
Man: Good evening,
ladies and ghouls.

779
00:51:45,341 --> 00:51:47,969
Join us at the Middlesex
Pavilion Mall

780
00:51:48,045 --> 00:51:51,606
for the Middlesex
Halloween Haunt...

781
00:51:51,682 --> 00:51:53,673
(man laughs)

782
00:51:53,784 --> 00:51:55,581
(chuckles)

783
00:52:59,955 --> 00:53:02,446
(airplane engine whines)

784
00:53:16,373 --> 00:53:19,103
Gretchen: And what if
you could go back in time

785
00:53:19,176 --> 00:53:21,667
and take all those hours
of pain and darkness

786
00:53:21,746 --> 00:53:24,010
and replace them
with something better?

787
00:53:24,081 --> 00:53:25,981
Like images, or what?

788
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:29,508
Yeah, like a Hawaiian sunset
or the Grand Canyon.

789
00:53:29,587 --> 00:53:32,112
Things that remind you
of how beautiful the world--

790
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:34,158
We've been going together
for like, two weeks.

791
00:53:35,761 --> 00:53:37,160
Yeah?

792
00:53:39,398 --> 00:53:41,263
Well, I...

793
00:53:43,703 --> 00:53:45,671
Do you want to kiss me?

794
00:53:53,312 --> 00:53:55,803
- I-- I'm sorry.
- Look, Donnie, wait.

795
00:53:55,883 --> 00:53:59,375
- I like you a lot.
- I just want it to be...

796
00:53:59,453 --> 00:54:02,251
at a time when it...

797
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:04,222
When what?

798
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:06,555
When it
reminds me-- just...

799
00:54:08,196 --> 00:54:11,131
When it reminds you
how beautiful the world can be?

800
00:54:12,267 --> 00:54:14,064
Yeah.

801
00:54:15,136 --> 00:54:18,003
And right now there's some fat guy
over there staring at us.

802
00:54:24,547 --> 00:54:28,449
Thank you for seeing us
at such late notice.

803
00:54:28,517 --> 00:54:31,543
We both felt
that it was time

804
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:33,178
for us to come in
and discuss...

805
00:54:33,255 --> 00:54:35,951
What I think is
going on with your son?

806
00:54:36,026 --> 00:54:38,517
Yes.

807
00:54:38,595 --> 00:54:41,758
Well, he's--

808
00:54:43,934 --> 00:54:45,492
You know
about his past,

809
00:54:45,602 --> 00:54:47,126
and he was suspended
from school

810
00:54:47,238 --> 00:54:49,706
for insulting
his gym teacher.

811
00:54:49,807 --> 00:54:51,741
I'm not really sure
that's a good example.

812
00:54:51,809 --> 00:54:54,437
I think he had just cause
to insult her.

813
00:54:54,512 --> 00:54:57,242
Rose, let me
just lay out

814
00:54:57,315 --> 00:54:58,714
what I believe
is happening here.

815
00:55:01,954 --> 00:55:04,252
Dr. Thurman:
Donnie's aggressive behavior...

816
00:55:05,858 --> 00:55:09,658
his increased detachment
from reality,

817
00:55:09,728 --> 00:55:13,721
seem to stem
from his inability to cope

818
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:17,269
with the forces in the world
he perceives to be threatening.

819
00:55:23,143 --> 00:55:25,543
Has he ever told you
about his friend Frank?

820
00:55:30,251 --> 00:55:32,151
Frank?

821
00:55:32,219 --> 00:55:34,517
Yes, the giant
bunny rabbit.

822
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:37,280
The what?

823
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:43,998
I don't recall...

824
00:55:44,065 --> 00:55:47,000
him ever having
mentioned a rabbit.

825
00:55:47,102 --> 00:55:49,798
Donnie is experiencing
what is commonly called

826
00:55:49,905 --> 00:55:51,839
a daylight hallucination.

827
00:55:53,609 --> 00:55:56,043
(thumping)

828
00:55:56,112 --> 00:55:59,673
This is a common occurrence
among paranoid schizophrenics.

829
00:56:01,951 --> 00:56:03,782
What can we do?

830
00:56:03,854 --> 00:56:05,981
I would like to...

831
00:56:06,056 --> 00:56:07,785
do more hypnotherapy,

832
00:56:10,127 --> 00:56:12,493
and increase his medication.

833
00:56:14,464 --> 00:56:16,694
(grunts)

834
00:56:16,768 --> 00:56:18,702
(thunderclap)

835
00:56:18,770 --> 00:56:21,603
Rose:
Whatever will help him, really,

836
00:56:23,341 --> 00:56:25,070
because that's why
we're here.

837
00:56:25,143 --> 00:56:28,579
We just would like him
to experience some...

838
00:56:28,646 --> 00:56:30,614
relief.

839
00:56:30,716 --> 00:56:34,413
So if you think that
more medication will do that,

840
00:56:35,588 --> 00:56:39,854
then I think we should
give it a try.

841
00:56:39,925 --> 00:56:41,493
(tower bell rings)

842
00:56:41,493 --> 00:56:42,323
(tower bell rings)

843
00:56:51,571 --> 00:56:54,165
Donnie Darko.

844
00:56:57,011 --> 00:56:58,911
I know.

845
00:56:59,981 --> 00:57:02,677
(both laughing)

846
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:05,548
(applause)

847
00:57:08,123 --> 00:57:09,681
Good morning,
you mongrels!

848
00:57:09,758 --> 00:57:11,055
Good morning.

849
00:57:11,126 --> 00:57:12,855
Is that all the gusto
you can muster?

850
00:57:12,928 --> 00:57:14,225
I said, "Good morning!"

851
00:57:14,296 --> 00:57:16,856
Good morning!

852
00:57:16,932 --> 00:57:18,763
Now that's a tiny,
tiny bit better.

853
00:57:18,834 --> 00:57:21,394
But I can still sense
some students out there

854
00:57:21,471 --> 00:57:24,634
who are actually afraid
to say, "Good morning!"

855
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:28,006
- Good morning!
- Yeah, that's what I like to hear!

856
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:31,239
Because entirely too many
young men and women today

857
00:57:31,347 --> 00:57:34,646
are completely paralyzed
by their fears.

858
00:57:35,886 --> 00:57:38,787
They surrender their bodies
to the temptation

859
00:57:38,856 --> 00:57:42,849
and destruction of drugs,
alcohol, and premarital sex.

860
00:57:44,328 --> 00:57:47,764
Now, I'm going to tell you
a little story today.

861
00:57:47,832 --> 00:57:50,096
It's a heartbreakingly
sad story

862
00:57:50,168 --> 00:57:52,193
about a young man

863
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:54,500
whose life was
completely destroyed

864
00:57:54,572 --> 00:57:56,767
by these instruments
offear.

865
00:57:56,841 --> 00:57:58,706
A young man,

866
00:57:58,777 --> 00:58:02,042
searching for love
in all the wrong places.

867
00:58:03,149 --> 00:58:05,777
His name was Frank.

868
00:58:09,989 --> 00:58:11,786
Hi, my stepsister...

869
00:58:11,858 --> 00:58:14,656
Like, I sometimes worry
that she eats too much.

870
00:58:14,728 --> 00:58:17,162
- Shut up, Kim!
- Sweetheart, please.

871
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:19,255
How can I decide what I want
to be when I grow up?

872
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:20,630
That's a hard one.

873
00:58:20,701 --> 00:58:21,895
(feedback squeals)

874
00:58:21,969 --> 00:58:23,937
What do I do
to learn how to fight?

875
00:58:24,004 --> 00:58:27,371
"What do I do
to learn how to fight?  "

876
00:58:27,442 --> 00:58:31,378
Son, violence is
a product of fear.

877
00:58:31,446 --> 00:58:33,209
Learn to truly love
yourself.

878
00:58:33,314 --> 00:58:35,612
- Okay.
- Okay, get yourself up here.

879
00:58:35,717 --> 00:58:38,481
- Okay.
- Jim: All right.

880
00:58:41,757 --> 00:58:43,884
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

881
00:58:43,959 --> 00:58:45,950
Um...

882
00:58:46,028 --> 00:58:47,620
How much are they
paying you to be here?

883
00:58:49,098 --> 00:58:50,588
Uh... excuse me?

884
00:58:52,802 --> 00:58:54,463
Jim:
What is your name, son?

885
00:58:54,537 --> 00:58:56,368
Gerald.

886
00:58:56,439 --> 00:58:57,963
Well, Gerald,

887
00:58:58,041 --> 00:58:59,565
I think you're afraid.

888
00:58:59,642 --> 00:59:01,371
Are you telling us this stuff
so we can buy your book?

889
00:59:01,444 --> 00:59:03,378
Because I got to tell you,
if you are,

890
00:59:03,447 --> 00:59:05,347
that was some of the worst
advice I ever heard.

891
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:07,008
Jim: Do you see
how sad this is?

892
00:59:07,118 --> 00:59:08,585
Do you want your sister
to lose weight?

893
00:59:08,686 --> 00:59:10,415
Tell her to get off the couch,
stop eating Twinkies,

894
00:59:10,521 --> 00:59:13,513
and maybe go out for field hockey.
You know what?

895
00:59:13,624 --> 00:59:16,115
No one ever knows what they
want to be when they grow up.

896
00:59:16,228 --> 00:59:18,924
It takes a little while
to find that out.

897
00:59:18,997 --> 00:59:20,897
Right, Jim?
And you...

898
00:59:20,966 --> 00:59:23,059
Yeah, you.

899
00:59:24,169 --> 00:59:27,195
Sick of some jerk shoving
your head down the toilet?

900
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:29,433
Maybe you should
lift some weights

901
00:59:29,509 --> 00:59:31,909
or take a karate lesson.
And the next time he tries to do it,

902
00:59:31,978 --> 00:59:33,843
you kick him
in the balls.

903
00:59:33,913 --> 00:59:36,108
(adults gasp;
students laugh)

904
00:59:36,182 --> 00:59:38,173
(Jim chuckles)
Son. Do you see this?

905
00:59:38,251 --> 00:59:40,446
- Right?
- This is an anger prisoner,

906
00:59:40,553 --> 00:59:42,180
- Man: Remove him.
- Jim: A textbook example.

907
00:59:42,289 --> 00:59:43,779
Do you see
the fear, people?

908
00:59:43,891 --> 00:59:46,689
This boy is scared to death
of the truth.

909
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:49,888
Son, it breaks my heart
to say this,

910
00:59:49,963 --> 00:59:54,525
but I believe you are a very
troubled and confused young man.

911
00:59:54,602 --> 00:59:57,571
I believe you are searching for
the answers in all the wrong places.

912
00:59:57,639 --> 00:59:59,266
You're right, actually.

913
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:00,637
I am pretty--
I'm pretty troubled

914
01:00:00,708 --> 01:00:02,676
and I'm pretty confused,
but I--

915
01:00:02,744 --> 01:00:05,645
and I'm afraid, really,
really afraid.

916
01:00:05,713 --> 01:00:07,146
Really afraid.
But I--

917
01:00:07,216 --> 01:00:09,184
I think you're
the fucking Antichrist.

918
01:00:09,251 --> 01:00:11,185
(audience gasping)

919
01:00:11,253 --> 01:00:14,120
Man: Get him out of here!
Who do you think you are?

920
01:00:14,223 --> 01:00:17,681
(whistling; cheering)

921
01:00:22,299 --> 01:00:23,527
It's amazing.

922
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,431
The man thinks
he's telling the truth,

923
01:00:25,502 --> 01:00:28,528
and everything he says
is just a fucking lie!

924
01:00:28,605 --> 01:00:30,800
Everything he says!

925
01:00:30,874 --> 01:00:34,310
Everyone thinks he's so rad.
He's such a fucking chud.

926
01:00:34,378 --> 01:00:36,710
- Everything he does--
- Are you okay?

927
01:00:40,518 --> 01:00:43,976
- Yeah.
- Sit down. Calm down.

928
01:00:49,094 --> 01:00:51,062
You ever hear
of Grandma Death?

929
01:00:52,297 --> 01:00:53,457
Who?

930
01:00:59,339 --> 01:01:01,102
"The Philosophy
of Time Travel."

931
01:01:01,174 --> 01:01:03,301
What is this?

932
01:01:03,376 --> 01:01:04,866
She wrote it.

933
01:01:14,121 --> 01:01:16,248
I'm--

934
01:01:16,323 --> 01:01:18,052
I've been seeing stuff.

935
01:01:18,125 --> 01:01:20,855
Like, a lot of really
messed up stuff.

936
01:01:22,096 --> 01:01:23,757
And there are chapters
in that book

937
01:01:23,864 --> 01:01:25,525
that describe the stuff
I've been seeing.

938
01:01:25,634 --> 01:01:27,659
It can't just be
a coincidence.

939
01:01:30,138 --> 01:01:33,073
Dr. Monnitoff: Each vessel
travels along a vector...

940
01:01:33,141 --> 01:01:36,042
through space-time,
along its center of gravity.

941
01:01:36,111 --> 01:01:37,669
Like a spear.

942
01:01:37,747 --> 01:01:40,341
I beg your pardon?

943
01:01:40,416 --> 01:01:43,146
Like a spear
that comes out of your chest.

944
01:01:43,219 --> 01:01:45,847
Umm... sure.

945
01:01:45,922 --> 01:01:49,551
And in order for the vessel
to travel through time,

946
01:01:49,625 --> 01:01:52,617
it's got to find a portal,
or in this case a wormhole--

947
01:01:52,696 --> 01:01:54,687
Could these portals--

948
01:01:54,798 --> 01:01:58,894
Could these portals
just appear anywhere, anytime?

949
01:01:59,002 --> 01:02:01,061
I think that's
highly unlikely.

950
01:02:01,171 --> 01:02:03,105
No, I think what you're
talking about is...

951
01:02:03,174 --> 01:02:04,573
an act of God.

952
01:02:04,642 --> 01:02:07,110
If God controls time,
then all time is pre-decided.

953
01:02:09,013 --> 01:02:10,844
I'm not following you.

954
01:02:10,915 --> 01:02:13,383
Every living thing
follows along a set path.

955
01:02:13,451 --> 01:02:16,784
And if you could see
your path or channel,

956
01:02:16,855 --> 01:02:19,050
then you could see
into the future, right?

957
01:02:19,124 --> 01:02:21,285
Like... that's
a form of time travel.

958
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:25,057
Well, you're
contradicting yourself.

959
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:26,859
If we were able to see

960
01:02:26,966 --> 01:02:29,400
our destinies manifest
themselves visually,

961
01:02:29,469 --> 01:02:31,460
then we would be
given a choice

962
01:02:31,571 --> 01:02:33,937
to betray
our chosen destinies.

963
01:02:34,007 --> 01:02:35,668
And the mere fact
that this choice exists,

964
01:02:35,742 --> 01:02:40,111
would make all pre-formed
destiny come to an end.

965
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:41,943
Not if you travel
within God's channel.

966
01:02:44,752 --> 01:02:46,481
Um...

967
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:50,752
I'm not going to be able
to continue this conversation.

968
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:55,824
- Why?
- I could lose my job.

969
01:02:57,699 --> 01:02:59,257
Okay.

970
01:03:50,690 --> 01:03:52,954
(chuckles)

971
01:03:53,025 --> 01:03:55,255
Frank:
Now you know where he lives.

972
01:03:57,697 --> 01:04:00,165
Dr. Thurman: And they grow
out of our chest...

973
01:04:00,233 --> 01:04:02,133
solar plexus?

974
01:04:02,202 --> 01:04:04,261
Donnie: Just like she
described in the book,

975
01:04:04,338 --> 01:04:06,704
the way they moved
and they smelled.

976
01:04:06,773 --> 01:04:08,468
It's like--
like they're workers.

977
01:04:10,243 --> 01:04:11,938
Assigned to each one of us.

978
01:04:12,046 --> 01:04:14,606
They just--
they're like liquid.

979
01:04:16,017 --> 01:04:18,417
I followed it...

980
01:04:18,486 --> 01:04:21,114
into my parents' bedroom.

981
01:04:21,189 --> 01:04:22,781
What did you find?

982
01:04:27,863 --> 01:04:29,728
Nothing.

983
01:04:33,736 --> 01:04:36,603
Donnie:
So we call them IMGs.

984
01:04:36,673 --> 01:04:39,073
Gretchen:
Infant Memory Generators.

985
01:04:39,142 --> 01:04:42,134
The idea is that you buy
these glasses for your infant,

986
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:44,179
and they wear them
at night when they sleep.

987
01:04:45,281 --> 01:04:48,717
Gretchen: But inside the glasses
are these slide photographs.

988
01:04:48,785 --> 01:04:52,312
And each photograph is of something
peaceful or beautiful...

989
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:54,950
whatever the parents
want to put inside.

990
01:04:55,025 --> 01:04:57,585
And what effect do you think
this would have on an infant?

991
01:04:57,661 --> 01:04:59,891
Well...

992
01:04:59,964 --> 01:05:01,795
the thing is, nobody
remembers their infancy.

993
01:05:01,866 --> 01:05:04,198
Anyone who says
they do is lying.

994
01:05:04,269 --> 01:05:06,703
So we think this will help develop
memory earlier in life.

995
01:05:06,772 --> 01:05:08,205
Yeah.

996
01:05:08,273 --> 01:05:10,741
Did you stop and think that maybe
infants need darkness?

997
01:05:10,809 --> 01:05:13,778
That maybe darkness is part
of their natural development?

998
01:05:17,583 --> 01:05:19,380
- Gretchen: No.
- Mm-mm.

999
01:05:19,452 --> 01:05:22,216
(snaps fingers)

1000
01:05:22,288 --> 01:05:23,755
Yeah.

1001
01:05:23,823 --> 01:05:26,417
What if the parents
put in pictures of Satan?

1002
01:05:26,492 --> 01:05:28,426
Or, like, dead people?
Crap like that.

1003
01:05:28,495 --> 01:05:30,986
Is that what you'd
show your kids?

1004
01:05:32,566 --> 01:05:34,591
Well, I mean...

1005
01:05:34,668 --> 01:05:37,728
didn't your dad, like,
stab your mom?

1006
01:05:41,409 --> 01:05:43,001
(screeches)

1007
01:05:47,148 --> 01:05:49,082
Get out.

1008
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:50,310
(class bell rings)

1009
01:05:50,418 --> 01:05:53,182
Gretchen!
I'm sorry, Gretchen.

1010
01:05:53,254 --> 01:05:55,620
Gretchen,
I'm sorry about those guys.

1011
01:05:55,691 --> 01:05:56,988
They're fucking--

1012
01:06:23,955 --> 01:06:25,582
Two for "Evil Dead,"
please.

1013
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:28,090
That'll be $2.

1014
01:06:36,034 --> 01:06:39,231
(slow pounding)

1015
01:07:15,176 --> 01:07:18,509
Why do you wear
that stupid bunny suit?

1016
01:07:23,352 --> 01:07:26,583
Why are you wearing
that stupid man suit?

1017
01:07:36,033 --> 01:07:38,467
Take it off.

1018
01:07:57,956 --> 01:08:00,049
What happened
to your eye?

1019
01:08:06,532 --> 01:08:09,000
Frank:
I'm so sorry.

1020
01:08:16,176 --> 01:08:18,269
Why do they
call you Frank?

1021
01:08:18,345 --> 01:08:21,371
It is the name
of my father...

1022
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:26,951
and his father
before me.

1023
01:08:30,691 --> 01:08:32,488
Frank?

1024
01:08:36,464 --> 01:08:38,364
When's this going
to stop?

1025
01:08:38,432 --> 01:08:40,992
You should already
know that.

1026
01:08:41,103 --> 01:08:43,469
(giggles)

1027
01:08:44,539 --> 01:08:46,837
I want you
to watch the movie screen.

1028
01:08:48,977 --> 01:08:51,639
There's something
I want to show you.

1029
01:08:59,789 --> 01:09:02,280
Have you ever
seen a portal?

1030
01:09:05,829 --> 01:09:08,525
(bell ringing)

1031
01:09:20,845 --> 01:09:22,472
Burn it to the ground.

1032
01:10:02,857 --> 01:10:05,690
(music plays)

1033
01:10:36,627 --> 01:10:39,460
Okay, now girls...

1034
01:10:39,530 --> 01:10:40,827
I want you
to concentrate.

1035
01:10:40,898 --> 01:10:43,662
Failure is not
an option.

1036
01:10:43,734 --> 01:10:47,670
And Bethany, if you feel
the need to vomit up there...

1037
01:10:47,772 --> 01:10:50,900
- just swallow it.
- Okay, Mom.

1038
01:10:51,009 --> 01:10:53,569
Hey, you guys,
good luck out there.

1039
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:09,123
(rude whistling)

1040
01:11:09,195 --> 01:11:12,323
Seth:
Get off the stage, Cherita!

1041
01:11:16,403 --> 01:11:17,961
You suck!

1042
01:11:25,412 --> 01:11:27,710
Principal:
Hold on.

1043
01:11:32,854 --> 01:11:34,583
Now that was
really something.

1044
01:11:34,656 --> 01:11:37,090
Thank you, Cherita Chen,
with "Autumn Angel."

1045
01:11:37,158 --> 01:11:40,958
And now the moment we've
all been waiting for is here.

1046
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:42,930
It is my very distinct
pleasure

1047
01:11:42,998 --> 01:11:44,727
to introduce to you...

1048
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,563
Emily Bates, Suzy Bailey,

1049
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:49,069
Samantha Darko,
Beth Farmer,

1050
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:52,164
and Joanie James.
They are... "Sparkle Motion."

1051
01:11:53,977 --> 01:11:58,937
# No-- no-- notorious...
Notorious

1052
01:12:01,818 --> 01:12:05,720
# No-- no--
notorious

1053
01:12:15,132 --> 01:12:18,795
# I can't read about it

1054
01:12:18,871 --> 01:12:22,898
# Burns the skin
from your eyes

1055
01:12:24,009 --> 01:12:28,002
# I'll do fine
without it

1056
01:12:29,147 --> 01:12:32,082
# Here's one
you don't compromise

1057
01:12:33,186 --> 01:12:37,919
# Lies come
hard in disguise

1058
01:12:37,991 --> 01:12:42,519
# They need to fight it out,
not wild about it

1059
01:12:42,595 --> 01:12:46,326
# Lay your seedy judgments

1060
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:50,336
# Who says they're
part of our lives?

1061
01:12:51,405 --> 01:12:53,032
# You own the money

1062
01:12:53,107 --> 01:12:55,769
# You control the witness

1063
01:12:55,843 --> 01:12:57,470
# I'll leave you lonely

1064
01:12:57,545 --> 01:12:59,809
# Don't monkey
with my business

1065
01:12:59,881 --> 01:13:01,974
# You pay the prophets

1066
01:13:02,083 --> 01:13:04,643
# To justify your reasons

1067
01:13:04,753 --> 01:13:08,018
# I heard your promise,
but I don't believe it

1068
01:13:08,089 --> 01:13:09,886
# That's why
I've done it again...

1069
01:13:36,854 --> 01:13:39,288
Girl:
All right, Sparkle Motion!

1070
01:14:38,086 --> 01:14:40,782
(man screaming)

1071
01:14:47,597 --> 01:14:49,929
Gretchen:
How long was I asleep for?

1072
01:14:49,999 --> 01:14:52,433
Whole movie.

1073
01:15:02,279 --> 01:15:03,871
Captain...

1074
01:15:03,947 --> 01:15:05,710
Looks like we've got
another room back here.

1075
01:15:07,519 --> 01:15:08,747
TV Reporter:
The blaze was extinguished

1076
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:11,380
sometime after 8:00 last night.

1077
01:15:11,456 --> 01:15:14,220
Firefighters discovered
what has been referred to

1078
01:15:14,292 --> 01:15:16,692
as a "kiddie porn dungeon."

1079
01:15:16,795 --> 01:15:19,229
Cunningham, who has become
a recent celebrity

1080
01:15:19,331 --> 01:15:21,026
for his books
and motivational tapes,

1081
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:23,864
- was arrested early this morning...
- Oh, my God!

1082
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:26,564
...at Sarasota Heights Country Club.

1083
01:15:26,639 --> 01:15:28,504
Arson has not
been ruled out

1084
01:15:28,574 --> 01:15:30,303
as part of the cause
of the fire.

1085
01:15:30,377 --> 01:15:34,143
A group of Cunning Vision
employees...

1086
01:15:34,214 --> 01:15:36,148
Oh, my God.
Dad played golf with that guy.

1087
01:15:36,216 --> 01:15:38,616
...vehemently denied
the alleged link

1088
01:15:38,685 --> 01:15:40,846
to a child pornography
publishing circuit.

1089
01:15:40,921 --> 01:15:42,718
In a vicious statement,

1090
01:15:42,789 --> 01:15:45,622
Cunningham attacked the Middlesex
Fire Department officials,

1091
01:15:45,693 --> 01:15:47,923
claiming a vast conspiracy.

1092
01:15:48,029 --> 01:15:51,055
Principal: I'm sorry, Karen,
but we don't think the methods

1093
01:15:51,165 --> 01:15:53,599
you've undertaken here
are appropriate.

1094
01:15:53,701 --> 01:15:56,465
With all due respect, sir,
what exactly about my methods

1095
01:15:56,538 --> 01:15:58,506
do you find
inappropriate?

1096
01:15:59,942 --> 01:16:02,172
I don't have time to get
into a debate about this.

1097
01:16:02,244 --> 01:16:05,372
I believe I've
made myself clear.

1098
01:16:05,447 --> 01:16:08,143
You call this clarity?

1099
01:16:08,217 --> 01:16:09,741
I don't think
that you have a clue

1100
01:16:09,819 --> 01:16:12,117
what it's like to communicate
with these kids.

1101
01:16:12,188 --> 01:16:16,124
And we are losing them
to apathy...

1102
01:16:18,061 --> 01:16:21,394
to this prescribed nonsense.

1103
01:16:22,733 --> 01:16:24,633
They are slipping away.

1104
01:16:24,702 --> 01:16:27,535
I am sorry
that you have failed.

1105
01:16:27,605 --> 01:16:31,837
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have another appointment.

1106
01:16:33,577 --> 01:16:36,011
You can finish out the week.

1107
01:16:41,620 --> 01:16:45,351
(screams)
Fuck!

1108
01:17:05,078 --> 01:17:06,807
Good afternoon.

1109
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:09,212
It gives me
great pleasure to announce

1110
01:17:09,283 --> 01:17:11,513
that the Middlesex Ridge
School dance team

1111
01:17:11,585 --> 01:17:13,644
has been invited to perform

1112
01:17:13,721 --> 01:17:16,087
on Ed McMahon's
"Star Search '88"

1113
01:17:16,157 --> 01:17:18,421
in Los Angeles, California.

1114
01:17:21,563 --> 01:17:23,030
(silent)

1115
01:17:47,524 --> 01:17:49,458
(doorbell rings)

1116
01:17:53,397 --> 01:17:56,457
No, it was ridiculous.
I'll call you back.

1117
01:17:58,502 --> 01:18:00,800
- Rose.
- Kitty.

1118
01:18:02,974 --> 01:18:05,135
I'm sure you're aware
of the horrible allegations

1119
01:18:05,244 --> 01:18:06,711
against Jim Cunningham.

1120
01:18:06,812 --> 01:18:08,245
I know,
I saw it on TV.

1121
01:18:08,313 --> 01:18:10,281
Something about a...
"kiddie porn dungeon."

1122
01:18:10,349 --> 01:18:13,750
Please, please.
Don't use those words!

1123
01:18:13,819 --> 01:18:16,617
It's obviously some kind
of conspiracy

1124
01:18:16,688 --> 01:18:18,588
to destroy
an innocent man.

1125
01:18:18,658 --> 01:18:21,559
I have taken it upon myself
to spearhead

1126
01:18:21,628 --> 01:18:23,596
the Jim Cunningham
defense campaign.

1127
01:18:25,498 --> 01:18:27,125
Rose...

1128
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:29,794
I have to appear at his arraignment
tomorrow morning.

1129
01:18:29,870 --> 01:18:32,168
As you know, the girls
are scheduled to leave

1130
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:34,002
for Los Angeles
in the morning.

1131
01:18:34,074 --> 01:18:36,872
As their coach,
I was the obvious choice

1132
01:18:36,977 --> 01:18:38,535
to chaperone them
on their trip--

1133
01:18:38,646 --> 01:18:41,206
But now...
you can't go.

1134
01:18:41,315 --> 01:18:43,078
- Yes.
- Hmm.

1135
01:18:43,151 --> 01:18:45,847
Believe me,
of all the other mothers,

1136
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:48,184
I would never dream
of asking you.

1137
01:18:48,256 --> 01:18:50,850
But none of the other mothers
are available to go.

1138
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:55,527
I don't know, Kitty.

1139
01:18:55,598 --> 01:18:58,761
It's a bad weekend.
Eddie's in New York.

1140
01:18:58,834 --> 01:19:00,825
Rose!

1141
01:19:00,903 --> 01:19:03,167
I don't know
if you realize

1142
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:07,198
what an opportunity
this is for our daughters!

1143
01:19:07,276 --> 01:19:09,403
This has been
a dream of Samantha's

1144
01:19:09,513 --> 01:19:11,947
and all of ours
for a long time.

1145
01:19:12,015 --> 01:19:16,281
I made her lead dancer!

1146
01:19:16,353 --> 01:19:19,015
Sometimes I doubt
your commitment

1147
01:19:19,089 --> 01:19:21,057
to Sparkle Motion.

1148
01:19:51,324 --> 01:19:53,952
Elizabeth will be
in charge.

1149
01:19:54,027 --> 01:19:56,393
She'll drive you
to therapy.

1150
01:19:56,463 --> 01:19:59,455
If you need anything,
you promise me

1151
01:19:59,533 --> 01:20:01,899
that you will call
Dr. Thurman?

1152
01:20:03,637 --> 01:20:05,867
(softly)
Okay.

1153
01:20:12,246 --> 01:20:15,340
How's it feel to have
a wacko for a son?

1154
01:20:20,889 --> 01:20:23,653
It feels wonderful.

1155
01:21:04,336 --> 01:21:07,396
So what do I tell the other kids
when they ask about you?

1156
01:21:09,408 --> 01:21:12,309
Tell them that everything
is going to be just fine.

1157
01:21:14,747 --> 01:21:16,840
What's "Cellar Door"?

1158
01:21:18,785 --> 01:21:20,685
This famous linguist
once said,

1159
01:21:20,754 --> 01:21:24,315
that of all the phrases
in the English language...

1160
01:21:24,424 --> 01:21:26,892
of all the endless
combinations...

1161
01:21:26,993 --> 01:21:28,893
of words
in all of history,

1162
01:21:28,962 --> 01:21:31,829
that "cellar door"
is the most beautiful.

1163
01:21:34,635 --> 01:21:36,603
Donnie:
"Cellar door"?

1164
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:10,537
I promise
that one day

1165
01:22:10,608 --> 01:22:12,701
everything's going
to be better for you.

1166
01:22:14,612 --> 01:22:17,080
Chut up!

1167
01:22:29,794 --> 01:22:32,024
Dr. Thurman: I want to talk
about your past today.

1168
01:22:32,130 --> 01:22:33,927
Donnie:
No.

1169
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,458
Dr. Thurman: I want to talk about...
you and your parents.

1170
01:22:38,638 --> 01:22:38,905
Donnie:
They didn't buy me

1171
01:22:38,905 --> 01:22:40,839
Donnie:
They didn't buy me

1172
01:22:40,907 --> 01:22:42,431
what I wanted
for Christmas.

1173
01:22:42,508 --> 01:22:45,602
What did you want
for Christmas that year?

1174
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:48,511
"Hungry, Hungry Hippos."

1175
01:22:51,385 --> 01:22:53,046
How did you feel,

1176
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:56,112
being denied
these "Hungry, Hungry Hippos"?

1177
01:22:56,189 --> 01:22:58,214
Regret.

1178
01:22:58,292 --> 01:23:00,954
What else
makes you feel regret?

1179
01:23:03,231 --> 01:23:05,324
That I did it again.

1180
01:23:06,768 --> 01:23:08,463
You did it again?

1181
01:23:08,536 --> 01:23:11,164
I flooded my school

1182
01:23:11,239 --> 01:23:14,902
and I burned down
that pervert's house.

1183
01:23:14,977 --> 01:23:16,877
(laughing)

1184
01:23:16,946 --> 01:23:19,642
I only have a few days left
before they catch me.

1185
01:23:19,715 --> 01:23:22,183
Did Frank tell you
to do these things?

1186
01:23:22,251 --> 01:23:25,186
I have to obey him.
He saved my life.

1187
01:23:26,890 --> 01:23:29,859
I have to obey him
or I'll be left all alone.

1188
01:23:29,926 --> 01:23:32,292
And then--

1189
01:23:32,362 --> 01:23:34,455
and then I won't be able
to figure out

1190
01:23:34,531 --> 01:23:36,522
what this is all about.

1191
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:40,127
I won't be able
to know his master plan.

1192
01:23:40,237 --> 01:23:43,934
Do you mean,
God's master plan?

1193
01:23:45,009 --> 01:23:47,807
Do you now
believe in God?

1194
01:23:47,878 --> 01:23:50,472
I have the power to build
a time machine.

1195
01:23:50,549 --> 01:23:52,608
How is that possible?

1196
01:23:55,954 --> 01:23:57,945
How is time travel
possible?

1197
01:23:58,023 --> 01:23:59,786
Donnie?

1198
01:23:59,858 --> 01:24:02,019
Time's up,
Frank said.

1199
01:24:02,094 --> 01:24:04,358
When is this
going to happen?

1200
01:24:04,430 --> 01:24:06,864
Soon.

1201
01:24:10,403 --> 01:24:12,394
Soon.

1202
01:24:26,453 --> 01:24:28,819
What is going to happen?

1203
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:34,851
Frank is going to kill.

1204
01:24:34,929 --> 01:24:36,954
Who is he going to kill?

1205
01:24:40,902 --> 01:24:43,166
Who is he going to kill, Donnie?

1206
01:24:43,272 --> 01:24:44,796
I can see him right now!

1207
01:24:49,145 --> 01:24:51,841
The sky is going
to open up.

1208
01:24:57,988 --> 01:25:01,253
If the sky were
to suddenly open up,

1209
01:25:01,324 --> 01:25:04,885
there would be no law.
There would be no rule.

1210
01:25:04,961 --> 01:25:07,953
There would only be you
and your memories--

1211
01:25:08,032 --> 01:25:10,694
the choices you've made,

1212
01:25:10,768 --> 01:25:12,963
and the people
you've touched.

1213
01:25:14,038 --> 01:25:15,938
If this world were to end,

1214
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:18,031
there would only be you...

1215
01:25:18,142 --> 01:25:20,133
and him...

1216
01:25:20,245 --> 01:25:22,213
and no one else.

1217
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:02,548
Hey.

1218
01:26:02,624 --> 01:26:04,353
Elizabeth:
I got in.

1219
01:26:08,196 --> 01:26:10,494
I'm going to Harvard.

1220
01:26:12,735 --> 01:26:14,965
We should totally
throw a party.

1221
01:26:15,037 --> 01:26:17,028
I mean,
Mom and Dad are gone.

1222
01:26:17,106 --> 01:26:20,007
It's Halloween Carnival.
We could get away with it.

1223
01:26:20,076 --> 01:26:24,035
Okay, but it has to be
small, all right?

1224
01:26:24,147 --> 01:26:26,707
- What do you guys got?
- Nothing good.

1225
01:26:26,817 --> 01:26:29,115
Kid:
Happy Halloween!

1226
01:26:32,589 --> 01:26:34,523
(rock music playing)

1227
01:26:45,303 --> 01:26:48,898
(doorbell rings)

1228
01:26:55,881 --> 01:26:57,849
We got eggs,
water balloons

1229
01:26:57,950 --> 01:26:59,884
and a dozen rolls
of toilet paper.

1230
01:26:59,952 --> 01:27:02,216
I stole four beers
from my dad.

1231
01:27:02,288 --> 01:27:05,849
- Well, we got a keg.
- Keg beer is for pussies.

1232
01:27:15,603 --> 01:27:17,537
(phone ringing)

1233
01:27:20,575 --> 01:27:23,066
(beep tone)

1234
01:27:23,144 --> 01:27:25,908
Rose, this is Lilian Thurman.

1235
01:27:25,980 --> 01:27:28,448
It is extremely important
that you call me

1236
01:27:28,550 --> 01:27:30,211
as soon as you get
this message.

1237
01:27:30,319 --> 01:27:31,752
Thank you.

1238
01:27:38,126 --> 01:27:40,356
- Hi.
- Hey.

1239
01:27:44,133 --> 01:27:45,623
Are you okay?

1240
01:27:47,971 --> 01:27:49,802
Yeah, my mom's gone.

1241
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:53,742
You want to come in?

1242
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:55,368
Yeah.

1243
01:27:58,182 --> 01:28:00,548
(music plays louder)

1244
01:28:17,402 --> 01:28:19,097
I don't know, she...

1245
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:22,037
she didn't leave a note

1246
01:28:22,108 --> 01:28:24,838
and the house
was all messed up.

1247
01:28:24,911 --> 01:28:27,243
But you're okay?

1248
01:28:30,116 --> 01:28:32,744
Did you call the cops?

1249
01:28:32,819 --> 01:28:34,946
Yeah, they said I should
leave the house

1250
01:28:35,055 --> 01:28:38,547
and that I should go
to a safe place.

1251
01:28:40,027 --> 01:28:42,120
I'm just so scared.

1252
01:28:42,229 --> 01:28:44,163
I keep thinking
something awful

1253
01:28:44,231 --> 01:28:47,223
is happening, and...

1254
01:28:47,302 --> 01:28:50,396
it's my fucking stepdad,
I know it.

1255
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:02,344
I guess some people
are just born

1256
01:29:02,418 --> 01:29:04,511
with tragedy
in their blood.

1257
01:29:08,457 --> 01:29:10,448
Hey, have you guys
seen Frank?

1258
01:29:10,559 --> 01:29:12,493
No, I think they were going
on a beer run.

1259
01:29:12,595 --> 01:29:13,926
- Shit.
- (phone ringing)

1260
01:29:13,997 --> 01:29:15,931
(beep tone)

1261
01:29:15,999 --> 01:29:18,126
Rose: If you're there,
please pick up.

1262
01:29:18,201 --> 01:29:20,192
Oh, well.
Good news.

1263
01:29:20,270 --> 01:29:22,204
The girls, they got
three and a half stars,

1264
01:29:22,272 --> 01:29:24,570
and they get to come back
for the quarterfinals.

1265
01:29:24,642 --> 01:29:28,476
It was amazing.
Anyway...

1266
01:29:28,546 --> 01:29:31,845
we're going to take the red-eye
back tonight, and we ought to arrive--

1267
01:29:31,916 --> 01:29:33,577
Samantha: Mom--
the plane's about to leave.

1268
01:29:33,651 --> 01:29:35,585
Okay, okay. We'll take
the red-eye back tonight.

1269
01:29:35,653 --> 01:29:38,850
We should arrive around
8:30 in the morning.

1270
01:29:38,924 --> 01:29:42,052
I hope everything's
all right.

1271
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:45,857
I love you. Bye.

1272
01:29:45,964 --> 01:29:49,900
#...no private
consultation

1273
01:29:50,003 --> 01:29:53,769
# Under the Milky Way
tonight

1274
01:29:57,143 --> 01:30:01,910
# Wish I knew
what you were looking for

1275
01:30:04,284 --> 01:30:08,084
# Might have known
what you would find

1276
01:30:11,158 --> 01:30:14,719
# And it's something
quite peculiar

1277
01:30:18,166 --> 01:30:22,034
# Something shimmering
and white

1278
01:30:25,140 --> 01:30:27,199
# It leads you here

1279
01:30:27,275 --> 01:30:30,972
# Despite
your destination

1280
01:30:32,381 --> 01:30:35,714
# Under the Milky Way
tonight

1281
01:30:39,388 --> 01:30:43,757
# Wish I knew
what you were looking for

1282
01:30:46,530 --> 01:30:49,795
# Might have known
what you would find

1283
01:30:53,905 --> 01:30:58,672
# Wish I knew
what you were looking for

1284
01:31:00,511 --> 01:31:04,003
# Might have known
what you would find

1285
01:31:30,677 --> 01:31:32,611
Karen's voice:
"...the cellar door..."

1286
01:31:36,050 --> 01:31:39,918
# And it's something
quite peculiar...

1287
01:31:39,987 --> 01:31:42,751
- Come with me.
- Where are we going?

1288
01:31:42,823 --> 01:31:45,587
- Donnie.
- Look, we gotta go.

1289
01:31:46,728 --> 01:31:48,559
- Where?
- You ever see Grandma Death?

1290
01:31:48,630 --> 01:31:50,495
Why, is this about the book?

1291
01:31:50,565 --> 01:31:52,089
- No, it's Frank.
- Ronald: Donnie--

1292
01:31:52,167 --> 01:31:54,101
Time is running out!
We gotta go.

1293
01:32:25,170 --> 01:32:27,764
Donnie:
Roberta Sparrow.

1294
01:32:29,107 --> 01:32:31,337
Grandma Death.

1295
01:32:40,019 --> 01:32:43,284
Sean: Donnie, nobody's here.
Let's just forget about it.

1296
01:32:45,191 --> 01:32:47,489
Huh--
"Cellar door."

1297
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:49,118
What?

1298
01:33:27,337 --> 01:33:30,306
(sustained low note)

1299
01:33:35,378 --> 01:33:37,539
(brief keystroke)

1300
01:33:50,194 --> 01:33:52,754
Oh, my God!
Donnie! Donnie!

1301
01:33:56,901 --> 01:33:58,562
Donnie--!

1302
01:33:59,704 --> 01:34:01,672
Why the fuck
are you here?!

1303
01:34:01,740 --> 01:34:03,173
Oh, my God!

1304
01:34:06,512 --> 01:34:08,002
You're dead!

1305
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:09,274
What are we doing?

1306
01:34:09,382 --> 01:34:11,179
- Sean: Shit!
- Ronald: Leave him alone!

1307
01:34:14,754 --> 01:34:17,086
Don't fucking move!
Don't fucking move!

1308
01:34:19,026 --> 01:34:21,153
Fuck!

1309
01:34:26,166 --> 01:34:29,431
- There's a car.
- (coughing)

1310
01:34:29,503 --> 01:34:31,266
Get the hell
out of here. Now!

1311
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:35,274
Ricky: Seth, there's
a car coming. Let's go!

1312
01:34:35,343 --> 01:34:37,607
I have a bigger
knife now.

1313
01:34:41,916 --> 01:34:43,611
Let's go!
He called the cops!

1314
01:34:47,156 --> 01:34:48,680
Did you call
the fucking cops?!

1315
01:34:49,892 --> 01:34:52,554
- Deus ex machina.
- What did you just say?

1316
01:34:54,897 --> 01:34:57,559
- What the fuck did you just say?
- Our savior.

1317
01:35:02,138 --> 01:35:04,072
Donnie!

1318
01:35:12,016 --> 01:35:13,881
(car engine sputters)

1319
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:18,154
Donnie:
Gretchen...?

1320
01:35:22,493 --> 01:35:24,256
Gretchen...?

1321
01:35:26,164 --> 01:35:27,756
Gretchen.

1322
01:35:31,670 --> 01:35:33,831
Wake up, Gretchen.

1323
01:35:33,905 --> 01:35:36,396
- Frank...
- Wake up.

1324
01:35:36,476 --> 01:35:38,410
What did you do?

1325
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:43,449
Donnie: Gretchen,
wake up. Wake up.

1326
01:35:43,516 --> 01:35:45,381
Wake up.

1327
01:35:47,820 --> 01:35:49,685
Gretchen...

1328
01:35:49,790 --> 01:35:51,621
Gretchen...

1329
01:35:51,692 --> 01:35:54,160
"Clown": What the fuck
did you do, man?

1330
01:35:55,696 --> 01:35:57,630
You killed her,
Frank!

1331
01:36:01,136 --> 01:36:02,933
Is she dead?

1332
01:36:10,678 --> 01:36:14,011
What were you guys doing
in the middle of the road?!

1333
01:36:14,083 --> 01:36:15,710
What are you thinking?!

1334
01:36:23,025 --> 01:36:25,585
Go home.

1335
01:36:25,694 --> 01:36:28,094
Go home and tell your parents
everything will be okay.

1336
01:36:29,933 --> 01:36:31,560
Go!

1337
01:37:56,058 --> 01:37:58,492
(engine starts)

1338
01:38:12,510 --> 01:38:14,273
(tires screeching)

1339
01:38:24,890 --> 01:38:27,256
(sirens blaring)

1340
01:38:37,871 --> 01:38:40,101
Frank's voice:
28 days...

1341
01:38:41,207 --> 01:38:43,368
Donnie's voice:
Six hours...

1342
01:38:43,443 --> 01:38:47,072
42 minutes...

1343
01:38:47,147 --> 01:38:49,479
12 seconds.

1344
01:38:52,987 --> 01:38:55,251
Frank: I'm going home.

1345
01:39:10,839 --> 01:39:13,467
(Donnie chuckling)

1346
01:39:13,576 --> 01:39:16,067
Donnie's voice: So in order
to travel back in time,

1347
01:39:16,179 --> 01:39:18,579
you have to have a big spaceship
or something that can travel

1348
01:39:18,648 --> 01:39:21,014
- faster than the speed of light?
- Dr. Monnitoff: Theoretically.

1349
01:39:21,084 --> 01:39:22,915
And be able to find
one of these wormholes?

1350
01:39:22,986 --> 01:39:25,079
Dr. Monnitoff: The basic principles
of time travel are there.

1351
01:39:25,154 --> 01:39:27,486
You've got your vessel
and your portal.

1352
01:39:27,558 --> 01:39:29,423
And your vessel could be
just about anything,

1353
01:39:29,493 --> 01:39:31,757
most likely a spacecraft.

1354
01:39:31,829 --> 01:39:34,024
Metal craft of any kind.

1355
01:39:37,167 --> 01:39:39,135
(loud bang)

1356
01:39:46,678 --> 01:39:48,612
Gretchen's voice: What if you
could go back in time

1357
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:51,148
and take those hours
of pain and darkness

1358
01:39:51,216 --> 01:39:53,980
and replace them
with something better?

1359
01:40:37,833 --> 01:40:40,529
Donnie's voice:
"Dear Roberta Sparrow,

1360
01:40:40,602 --> 01:40:43,298
I've reached you
in your book,

1361
01:40:43,373 --> 01:40:45,671
but there's so many things
I need to ask you.

1362
01:40:46,776 --> 01:40:49,244
Sometimes I'm afraid
of what you might tell me.

1363
01:40:54,684 --> 01:40:56,379
Sometimes I'm afraid
that you'll tell me

1364
01:40:56,454 --> 01:40:58,012
this is not a work
offiction.

1365
01:40:59,290 --> 01:41:02,157
I can only hope
that the answers

1366
01:41:02,226 --> 01:41:04,990
will come to me
in my sleep.

1367
01:41:05,062 --> 01:41:07,326
I hope that when
the world comes to an end,

1368
01:41:07,398 --> 01:41:09,992
I can breathe
a sigh of relief,

1369
01:41:10,068 --> 01:41:14,300
because there will be
so much to look forward to."

1370
01:41:20,712 --> 01:41:22,646
(laughing)

1371
01:43:00,386 --> 01:43:04,584
# All around me
are familiar faces

1372
01:43:04,692 --> 01:43:07,684
# Worn out places

1373
01:43:07,795 --> 01:43:11,094
# Worn out faces

1374
01:43:11,165 --> 01:43:15,693
# Bright and early
for their daily races

1375
01:43:15,769 --> 01:43:18,738
# Going nowhere

1376
01:43:18,807 --> 01:43:22,538
# Going nowhere

1377
01:43:22,611 --> 01:43:26,741
# Their tears are filling up
their glasses

1378
01:43:26,815 --> 01:43:29,511
# No expression

1379
01:43:29,584 --> 01:43:33,042
# No expression

1380
01:43:33,122 --> 01:43:37,889
# Hide my head,
I want to drown my sorrow

1381
01:43:37,994 --> 01:43:40,929
# No tomorrow

1382
01:43:40,997 --> 01:43:44,694
# No tomorrow

1383
01:43:44,768 --> 01:43:47,760
# And I find it kind offunny

1384
01:43:47,838 --> 01:43:50,204
# I find it kind of sad

1385
01:43:50,274 --> 01:43:52,742
# The dreams in which I'm dying

1386
01:43:52,809 --> 01:43:55,437
# Are the best I've ever had

1387
01:43:55,512 --> 01:43:58,913
# I find it hard to tell you

1388
01:43:58,983 --> 01:44:01,383
# I find it hard to take

1389

01:44:12,665 --> 01:44:15,634
# Mad world

1393

# Children waiting

1394

# Happy birthday

1395
01:44:25,145 --> 01:44:28,410
# Happy birthday

1396
01:44:28,481 --> 01:44:33,180

01:44:35,623 --> 01:44:39,787
# Sit and listen

1399

# Went to school

1403
01:44:55,110 --> 01:44:57,908

01:44:57,980 --> 01:45:01,677

# Mad world.

1417
01:45:44,897 --> 01:45:46,660
Hey...

1418
01:45:46,732 --> 01:45:48,927
what's going on?

1419
01:45:49,001 --> 01:45:51,026
Horrible accident.

1420
01:45:51,138 --> 01:45:52,628
My neighbor...

1421
01:45:52,739 --> 01:45:54,468
got killed.

1422
01:45:54,574 --> 01:45:57,099
What happened?

1423
01:45:57,210 --> 01:45:59,371
Got smooshed
by a jet engine.

1424
01:46:05,019 --> 01:46:07,214
What was his name?

1425
01:46:07,288 --> 01:46:10,121
Donnie.
Donnie Darko.

1426
01:46:12,060 --> 01:46:14,255
I feel bad
for his family.

1427
01:46:15,830 --> 01:46:17,229
Yeah.

1428
01:46:24,406 --> 01:46:26,340
Boy:
Did you know him?

1429
01:46:29,379 --> 01:46:31,313
No.

1430
01:46:54,004 --> 01:46:56,564
Police radio:
...switch back to base.
