You're weird.

314
00:34:22,071 --> 00:34:23,446
Sorry.

315
00:34:23,656 --> 00:34:26,111
No, that was a compliment.

316
00:34:29,578 --> 00:34:31,618
Well, look, uh...

317
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:36,663
You want to go with me?

318
00:34:38,087 --> 00:34:43,425
- Where do you want to go?
- No, I mean, like, "go" with me.

319
00:34:43,634 --> 00:34:47,382
- You know, like "going together".
- Sure.

320
00:34:51,225 --> 00:34:53,514
0K. Where are you going?

321
00:34:55,729 --> 00:34:58,055
I'm going home.

322
00:35:01,777 --> 00:35:05,941
(MUTTERS) Stupid...
"Where are you going?"

323
00:35:14,498 --> 00:35:16,740
I'd like to try something new.

324
00:35:19,003 --> 00:35:21,458
Have you ever been hypnotised?

325
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:25,083
No.

326
00:35:33,726 --> 00:35:37,723
When I clap twice, you will wake up.
Do you understand?

327
00:35:38,939 --> 00:35:44,479
- Yes.
- So, tell me about your week.

328
00:35:44,695 --> 00:35:46,901
I met a girl.

329
00:35:49,158 --> 00:35:51,316
What is her name?

330
00:35:51,535 --> 00:35:53,575
Gretchen.

331
00:35:54,204 --> 00:35:56,244
We're going together now.

332
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:01,204
Do you still think about girls a lot?

333
00:36:02,588 --> 00:36:04,331
Yeah.

334
00:36:07,343 --> 00:36:12,799
- How are things going at school?
- I think about girls a lot.

335
00:36:13,015 --> 00:36:15,506
I asked you about school, Donnie.

336
00:36:15,726 --> 00:36:19,309
I think about fucking a lot during school.

337
00:36:20,773 --> 00:36:25,731
- What else do you think about during school?
- "Married With Children".

338
00:36:25,944 --> 00:36:29,812
- You think about your family?
- I just turn down the volume

339
00:36:30,032 --> 00:36:32,570
and think about fucking Christina Applegate.

340
00:36:32,785 --> 00:36:35,572
I asked you about your family.

341
00:36:35,788 --> 00:36:37,246
No.

342
00:36:38,499 --> 00:36:41,950
I don't think about fucking my family.
That's gross.

343
00:36:42,503 --> 00:36:45,290
I'd like to hear about your friend Frank.

344
00:37:02,439 --> 00:37:04,396
(PRINCIPAL) Sam Bylan.

345
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:17,161
Cherita Chen.

346
00:37:34,972 --> 00:37:36,347
Donald Darko.

347
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:01,408
Daye Dennis.

348
00:38:07,087 --> 00:38:09,413
Hey, you fuck!

349
00:38:10,507 --> 00:38:12,666
Did you say I flooded the school?

350
00:38:14,887 --> 00:38:18,801
- I didn't say shit.
- Yeah, well, they think I did it.

351
00:38:19,016 --> 00:38:23,061
If you're innocent,
then you have nothing to worry about, right?

352
00:38:23,312 --> 00:38:25,518
Fuck you! You know what I think?

353
00:38:27,524 --> 00:38:29,731
I think you did it.

354
00:38:44,917 --> 00:38:48,120
Beer and pussy - that's all I need.

355
00:38:48,337 --> 00:38:51,254
- We gotta find ourselves a Smurfette.
- Smurfette?

356
00:38:51,507 --> 00:38:55,635
Mm-hm.
Not some tight-ass Middlesex chick.

357
00:38:55,844 --> 00:39:01,301
Like, this cute little blonde that'll
get down with the guys like Smurfette does.

358
00:39:01,517 --> 00:39:03,889
Smurfette doesn't fuck.

359
00:39:05,521 --> 00:39:09,684
That's bullshit.
Why do you think Papa Smurf made her?

360
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,854
Because the other Smurfs
were getting too horny.

361
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:19,951
- Not vanity. I heard he was a homosexual.
- Then she fucks them while vanity watches.

362
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,280
What about Papa Smurf?
He must get some action?

363
00:39:23,539 --> 00:39:28,913
What he does, he films the gang-bang.
Later on, he beats off to the tape.

364
00:39:31,088 --> 00:39:34,920
First of all, Papa Smurf
didn't create Smurfette. Gargamel did.

365
00:39:35,134 --> 00:39:39,428
She was sent as Gargamel's evil spy
to destroy the Smurf village,

366
00:39:39,638 --> 00:39:43,766
but the overwhelming goodness
of the Smurfs transformed her.

367
00:39:44,018 --> 00:39:49,604
And as for the whole gang-bang scenario,
it just couldn't happen!

368
00:39:49,815 --> 00:39:56,648
Smurfs are asexual. They don't even have
reproductive organs under those little pants.

369
00:39:58,032 --> 00:40:01,946
That's what's so illogical
about being a Smurf.

370
00:40:02,161 --> 00:40:06,324
What's the point of living
if you don't have a dick?

371
00:40:10,419 --> 00:40:13,954
Donnie, why you gotta get smart on us?

372
00:40:14,214 --> 00:40:16,254
- (H0RN H0NKS)
- Grandma Death.

373
00:40:16,717 --> 00:40:20,762
(MISS FARMER) Excuse me! Excuse me!

374
00:40:20,971 --> 00:40:25,763
Please stay off the road, Miss Sparrow,
or I will call Social Services.

375
00:40:25,976 --> 00:40:29,511
I hate that Miss Farmer.
She's such a fucking bitch!

376
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,689
Yeah.

377
00:40:32,941 --> 00:40:35,349
- How old is Grandma Death?
- (D0NNIE) 101.

378
00:40:36,904 --> 00:40:39,395
She does the same thing every day.

379
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:45,441
Just walks back and forth
and back and forth to the mailbox.

380
00:40:46,747 --> 00:40:49,203
Nothing ever in there.

381
00:40:51,627 --> 00:40:54,711
0h, wait, wait, wait...

382
00:40:55,589 --> 00:40:59,634
She's going back to the box.
We may still have mail.

383
00:40:59,885 --> 00:41:02,293
- Mail, mail, mail.
- Here it is.

384
00:41:02,513 --> 00:41:05,679
This could be it. 0h?

385
00:41:05,933 --> 00:41:10,310
- 0h, no dice, Grandma. Sorry.
- Someone ought to write that bitch.

386
00:41:10,562 --> 00:41:12,721
(TV) Authorities continued their search

387
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:16,309
for a suspect
in the Middlesex Ridge School vandalism.

388
00:41:16,527 --> 00:41:20,904
The private school has asked
for donations to restore its beloved mascot,

389
00:41:21,115 --> 00:41:23,403
known only as the Mongrel...

390
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,329
It's very helpful.
There's a good turnout tonight.

391
00:41:37,047 --> 00:41:39,538
What are you trying to accomplish here?

392
00:41:39,758 --> 00:41:43,376
There was urine and faeces
flooded in my office.

393
00:41:44,763 --> 00:41:46,803
Whatever fits.

394
00:41:48,642 --> 00:41:50,884
"Whatever fits"?

395
00:41:51,103 --> 00:41:53,676
In cooperation with the county police,

396
00:41:53,897 --> 00:41:58,109
we have begun an active investigation
into the cause of the flooding.

397
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:02,061
And our suspects
include several of our own students...

398
00:42:02,281 --> 00:42:07,239
I want to know why this filth
is being taught to our children.

399
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:20,038
Kitty, I would appreciate if you would wait...

400
00:42:20,257 --> 00:42:27,138
Dr Cole, not only am I a teacher,
but I am also a parent of a Middlesex child.

401
00:42:27,389 --> 00:42:32,894
Therefore I am the only person here
who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.

402
00:42:36,732 --> 00:42:41,228
(FRANK) Don't worry. You got away with it.

403
00:42:41,487 --> 00:42:44,820
I have in my hand Graham Greene's
"The Destructors".

404
00:42:45,074 --> 00:42:50,115
This short story is part
of my daughter's English assignment.

405
00:42:50,329 --> 00:42:56,367
In this story, several children destroy
an elderly man's house from inside out.

406
00:42:59,797 --> 00:43:02,501
(EERIE HUMMING)

407
00:43:10,182 --> 00:43:12,388
How can you do that?

408
00:43:19,024 --> 00:43:25,822
And how do they do this? They flood the house
by breaking through a water main.

409
00:43:27,658 --> 00:43:30,778
I can do anything I want.

410
00:43:31,787 --> 00:43:33,412
And so can you.

411
00:43:33,622 --> 00:43:35,698
(APPLAUSE)

412
00:43:36,959 --> 00:43:40,209
And I think
that this garbage should be removed!

413
00:43:40,462 --> 00:43:45,089
Excuse me. What is the real issue here?
The PTA doesn't ban books.

414
00:43:45,342 --> 00:43:51,345
The PTA must acknowledge that pornography
is being taught in our curriculum!

415
00:43:51,598 --> 00:43:57,103
- It's meant to be ironic.
- Excuse me. Go back to grad school.

416
00:43:57,354 --> 00:44:01,352
Why did you make me flood the school?

417
00:44:04,862 --> 00:44:06,938
They are in great danger.

418
00:44:07,197 --> 00:44:10,364
Do you even know who Graham Greene is?

419
00:44:11,493 --> 00:44:14,530
I think we have all seen "Bonanza".

420
00:44:17,374 --> 00:44:21,039
Well, um... while we are on other topics...

421
00:44:21,295 --> 00:44:23,702
Where do you come from?

422
00:44:25,382 --> 00:44:28,169
Do you believe in time travel?

423
00:44:30,304 --> 00:44:32,510
(SAMANTHA) Who are you talking to?

424
00:44:36,685 --> 00:44:39,259
I was just taking my pills, Sam.

425
00:44:50,074 --> 00:44:52,991
A storm is coming, Frank says.

426
00:44:53,202 --> 00:44:56,238
A storm that will swallow the children,

427
00:44:57,122 --> 00:45:00,954
And I will deliver them
from the kingdom of pain.

428
00:45:01,168 --> 00:45:07,372
I'll deliver them back to their doorsteps,
send the monsters back to the underground.

429
00:45:07,591 --> 00:45:11,671
I'll send them back to a place
where no one else can see them.

430
00:45:11,887 --> 00:45:14,129
Except for me.

431
00:45:15,265 --> 00:45:18,136
Because I am Donnie Darko.

432
00:45:26,485 --> 00:45:27,896
Who is Frank?

433
00:45:34,868 --> 00:45:38,320
- A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
- (GIGGLING)

434
00:45:43,627 --> 00:45:49,547
In these modern times, our attitude
and beliefs are so delicate, so fragile.

435
00:45:49,758 --> 00:45:55,049
I have had a Cunning Vision.
This vision has released me.

436
00:45:55,264 --> 00:46:00,507
It's important that our lifeline be
rejuvenated, so that we can breathe again.

437
00:46:00,728 --> 00:46:02,767
It's time to breathe.

438
00:46:03,856 --> 00:46:06,014
It is time to breathe.

439
00:46:06,608 --> 00:46:08,648
Thank you, Jim Cunningham.

440
00:46:09,862 --> 00:46:12,353
Thank you, Jim Cunningham.

441
00:46:13,365 --> 00:46:18,704
So now let us begin Lifeline Exercise
Number One. Please press stop now.

442
00:46:26,128 --> 00:46:31,632
As you can see, the lifeline
is divided into two polar extremes.

443
00:46:31,842 --> 00:46:33,882
Fear and love.

444
00:46:34,136 --> 00:46:38,513
Fear is in the negative energy spectrum.

445
00:46:38,766 --> 00:46:42,894
- Love is in the positive energy spectrum.
- No, duh (!)

446
00:46:43,145 --> 00:46:47,854
Excuse me?
"No, duh" is a product of fear.

447
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:56,109
Now, on each card is a character dilemma
which applies to the lifeline.

448
00:46:59,286 --> 00:47:02,738
Please... Take this. Thank you.

449
00:47:03,457 --> 00:47:06,292
Please read each character dilemma aloud

450
00:47:06,502 --> 00:47:10,665
and place an "X" on the lifeline
in the appropriate place.

451
00:47:11,632 --> 00:47:13,459
Cherita?

452
00:47:21,225 --> 00:47:24,391
"Juanita has an important math test today.

453
00:47:24,603 --> 00:47:29,230
"She's known about the test
for several weeks, but has not studied.

454
00:47:29,441 --> 00:47:36,191
"In order to keep from failing,
Juanita decides to cheat on the math test."

455
00:47:39,576 --> 00:47:41,783
Good. Good. Very good.

456
00:47:42,037 --> 00:47:43,864
Mr Darko.

457
00:47:51,922 --> 00:47:54,591
"Ling Ling finds a wallet filled with money.

458
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:59,462
"She takes it to the address
on the driver's licence but keeps the money."

459
00:48:00,764 --> 00:48:03,434
I'm sorry, Miss Farmer. I don't get this.

460
00:48:03,684 --> 00:48:06,554
Just place an "X" in the appropriate place.

461
00:48:07,604 --> 00:48:13,191
I know what to do, but you can't lump things
into two categories.

462
00:48:13,402 --> 00:48:16,985
The lifeline is divided that way.

463
00:48:17,197 --> 00:48:19,771
Well, life isn't that simple. I mean...

464
00:48:19,992 --> 00:48:25,413
Who cares if Ling Ling keeps the money?
It has nothing to do with fear or love.

465
00:48:25,622 --> 00:48:31,495
- They are the deepest human emotions.
- 0K. But you're not listening to me.

466
00:48:31,712 --> 00:48:36,753
There are other things to take into account,

I have significant doubts about your...

to the path of fear.

which is theoretically
a wormhole in space controlled by man.

492
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:42,151
So, according to Hawking,
a wormhole may be able to provide a short cut

493
00:51:42,361 --> 00:51:45,231
for jumping
between two distant regions of space-time.

494
00:51:45,447 --> 00:51:50,690
So to travel back in time, you have to have
a spaceship faster than the speed of light.

495
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:53,947
- Theoretically.
- And be able to find a wormhole.

She was a nun long before that.

she became this entirely different person.

She up and left the church,
wrote this book...

And she whispered in my ear.

- What did she say?
- I think Frank wants me to talk to her.

He asked if I knew about time travel.

527
00:54:43,751 --> 00:54:49,421
She wrote a book about it,
so that can't be a coincidence, right?

What did she say to you?

She said that every living creature
on earth dies alone.

How did that make you feel?

531

It reminded me of my dog Callie.

532

She died when I was eight
and she crawled underneath the... the porch.

I've just never seen any proof,
so I just don't debate it any more.

I could spend my whole life debating it
over and over and still wouldn't have proof,

I was the obvious choice to chaperone them.

- Yes.

I would never dream of asking you.

of all the endless combinations of words
in all of history,

906

"cellar door" is the most beautiful.

907
01:39:23,027 --> 01:39:24,854
"Cellar door."

908
01:39:56,435 --> 01:40:00,764
I promise that one day
everything's gonna be better for you.

909
01:40:02,775 --> 01:40:05,100
Shut up!

(DONNIE) No.

How did you feel,
being denied these Hungry Hungry Hippos?

916

- Regret.
- What else makes you feel regret?

917
01:40:51,699 --> 01:40:56,195
- That I did it again.
- You did it again?

918

- I have to obey him. He saved my life.

I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone.

1081
02:07:06,857 --> 02:07:08,482
No.

1082
02:12:07,950 --> 02:12:12,363
# Oh, say, can you see

1083
02:12:12,580 --> 02:12:17,158
# By the dawn's early light

1084
02:12:17,376 --> 02:12:22,085
# What so proudly we hailed

1085
02:12:22,298 --> 02:12:27,423
# At the twilight's last gleaming?

1086
02:12:27,636 --> 02:12:32,298
# Whose broad stripes and bright stars

1087
02:12:32,516 --> 02:12:37,511
# Through the perilous fight

1088
02:12:37,730 --> 02:12:42,890
# O'er the ramparts we watched

1089
02:12:43,110 --> 02:12:48,187
# Were so gallantly streaming?

1090
02:12:48,407 --> 02:12:53,152
# And the rockets' red glare

1091
02:12:53,370 --> 02:12:58,447
# The bombs bursting in air

1092
02:12:58,667 --> 02:13:03,828
# Gave proof through the night

1093
02:13:04,048 --> 02:13:09,255
# That our flag was still there

1094
02:13:09,470 --> 02:13:19,803
# O say,
does that star-spangled banner yet wave

1095
02:13:22,566 --> 02:13:29,399
# O'er the land of the free

1096
02:13:29,615 --> 02:13:38,120
# And the home of the brave? #

1097
02:13:38,332 --> 02:13:40,905
