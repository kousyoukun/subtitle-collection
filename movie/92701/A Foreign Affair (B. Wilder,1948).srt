1
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,175
Congressmen, we're now
flying over the heart of Berlin.

2
00:01:58,061 --> 00:02:00,051
Berlin.

3
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:04,971
Over 75,000 tons of explosives
were dropped here.

4
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,173
British Lancasters by night,
American Fortresses by day.

5
00:02:08,222 --> 00:02:12,009
I heard Russian artillery
had a little part in it too, if you don't mind.

6
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:15,452
Sure they did and I wish
they'd pay us for all those cannons.

7
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:19,290
Hey, quit juggling. Film like this
is good stuff around election time.

8
00:02:19,342 --> 00:02:20,933
The incumbent overseas.

9
00:02:20,981 --> 00:02:23,620
Pennecot, don't you want to see it?
Look at it.

10
00:02:23,661 --> 00:02:28,132
Like pack rats been gnawing at a hunk
of old mouldy Roquefort cheese.

11
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:29,773
(Gags)

12
00:02:34,222 --> 00:02:37,533
Miss Frost? Congresswoman Frost?

13
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:40,143
- Present.
- We're flying over Berlin.

14
00:02:42,743 --> 00:02:44,938
15 minutes ahead of schedule.

15
00:02:44,982 --> 00:02:47,338
Well, don't you want to see it?

16
00:02:47,383 --> 00:02:49,374
One thing at a time.

17
00:03:26,465 --> 00:03:30,254
You got quite a sight coming.
Looks like chicken innards at frying time.

18
00:03:30,306 --> 00:03:32,865
Considering the taxpayers' money
poured on it,

19
00:03:32,906 --> 00:03:35,293
I don't expect it to look like a lace Valentine.

20
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,183
Golly.

21
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:50,014
(Man) Well, that's rough doing.
That sure is rough doing.

22
00:03:54,347 --> 00:03:57,976
(2nd man) They ought to put in grass
and move in a herd of longhorn.

23
00:03:58,027 --> 00:04:01,463
Build up their industries.
Get those smokestacks belching again.

24
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:04,658
- Not without organised labour.
- We got to feed the people.

25
00:04:04,707 --> 00:04:07,780
You can't keep a country
eating scraps out of garbage pails.

26
00:04:07,828 --> 00:04:10,978
I'm all for sending food,
only let 'em know where it's from.

27
00:04:11,027 --> 00:04:13,019
I object to dollar diplomacy.

28
00:04:13,068 --> 00:04:16,219
- But you don't mind sending food.
- There's a difference.

29
00:04:16,268 --> 00:04:18,828
If you give a hungry man bread,
that's democracy.

30
00:04:18,868 --> 00:04:21,701
If you leave the wrapper on, it's imperialism.

31
00:04:21,748 --> 00:04:25,343
Gentlemen, these are
very grave problems indeed

32
00:04:25,388 --> 00:04:28,541
but they don't happen to be
the problems of this committee.

33
00:04:28,589 --> 00:04:31,501
Perhaps I should remind you
why we were sent to Berlin,

34
00:04:31,549 --> 00:04:34,347
since our chairman,
Mr Pennecot of New Hampshire,

35
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:38,506
has been indisposed ever since
we took off from Washington.

36
00:04:38,548 --> 00:04:42,667
We're here to investigate the morale
of American occupation troops,

37
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:44,507
nothing else.

38
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,939
12,000 of our boys are policing
that pest hole down below

39
00:04:47,989 --> 00:04:53,063
and according to reports, they are being
infected by a kind of moral malaria.

40
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,740
It is our duty to their wives, their mothers,
their sisters, to find the facts.

41
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,781
And if these reports are true,

42
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,948
to fumigate that place with
all the insecticides at our disposal.

43
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,870
If you'll pardon me,
we're approaching Tempelhof Airfield.

44
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:12,342
(Man) Oh, God, if they haven't got
a reception out for us.

45
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,188
(2nd man) A band and everything.

46
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,426
(3rd man) They'll be glad to see home folks.

47
00:05:26,031 --> 00:05:30,867
Men, once more it is our honour and
privilege to welcome a visiting committee.

48
00:05:30,912 --> 00:05:35,270
Lately they seem to be coming
as regularly as the electric bill.

49
00:05:35,313 --> 00:05:37,668
This time it's not just VIPs.

50
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:40,432
This time we're getting VIPIs.

51
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:43,191
Very Important Persons Indeed.

52
00:05:43,232 --> 00:05:47,704
Some Congressional committee
to investigate our morale.

53
00:05:47,753 --> 00:05:52,223
Seems back home, they've got an idea
this here is one great big picnic,

54
00:05:52,272 --> 00:05:55,663
that all we do is swing in hammocks
with blonde Fräuleins,

55
00:05:55,713 --> 00:05:57,783
swap cigarettes for castles on the Rhine

56
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:00,393
and soak our feet in sparkling Mosel.

57
00:06:00,433 --> 00:06:02,503
Well, let's not kid ourselves.

58
00:06:02,553 --> 00:06:05,272
Some of you do go
overboard once in a while.

59
00:06:05,313 --> 00:06:09,432
Maybe some of you are working too hard
to enlighten the civilian population

60
00:06:09,474 --> 00:06:12,194
and maybe some of you
PX millionaires have found out

61
00:06:12,234 --> 00:06:16,352
you can parlay a pack of cigarettes
into something more than 20 smokes.

62
00:06:16,394 --> 00:06:19,307
After all, this isn't a Boy Scout camp.

63
00:06:19,354 --> 00:06:21,151
We've got a tough job on our hands

64
00:06:21,194 --> 00:06:24,345
and, by and large,
I think we're handling it darn well.

65
00:06:24,394 --> 00:06:27,034
For my dough, we're on the ball.

66
00:06:27,075 --> 00:06:29,795
Most of us, anyway... most of the time.

67
00:06:29,836 --> 00:06:35,627
What they've got to realise is you can't pin
sergeant's stripes on an archangel.

68
00:06:35,676 --> 00:06:38,588
Now, this committee
is going to be here for five days.

69
00:06:38,636 --> 00:06:41,355
Let's give them as good
an impression as possible.

70
00:06:41,396 --> 00:06:44,115
Not pussyfooting
around with a phoney attitude.

71
00:06:44,157 --> 00:06:46,717
That's not fair to them or us.

72
00:06:46,757 --> 00:06:49,668
I'm counting on you men to behave, period.

73
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:54,585
Morale. Maybe some day we can send
a little committee of our own

74
00:06:54,636 --> 00:06:56,991
to investigate morale in Washington, DC.

75
00:07:01,637 --> 00:07:05,755
Hey, look what I picked up
at the Brandenburg Gate.

76
00:07:07,157 --> 00:07:09,352
- How much?
- A dozen candy bars.

77
00:07:10,198 --> 00:07:12,392
They've still got some nine and a halfs.

78
00:07:12,437 --> 00:07:14,792
- I got no one to give them to.
- How about Trudy?

79
00:07:14,837 --> 00:07:18,432
I lost her. Russian sergeant came along
with a pound of rancid butter.

80
00:07:18,477 --> 00:07:21,629
- Those German dames are all alike.
- Speak for yourself.

81
00:07:21,678 --> 00:07:25,466
I wouldn't be afraid
of a Russian general with a ton of caviar.

82
00:07:26,398 --> 00:07:28,195
Nice toe.

83
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:32,316
The best.

84
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,714
We're here, Congressman.
Ready to unload?

85
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:48,274
([Music:] Upbeat march)

86
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:56,428
(Drill sergeant) Present... arms!

87
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,110
- Hello, Colonel.
- Nice to see you, General.

88
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:20,278
Mr Giffin from Texas, General Finney,
General McAndrew, Colonel Plummer.

89
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,516
- My pleasure.
- Mr Salvatore, from New York.

90
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:25,997
- The Bronx.
- Nobody's going to think you're Wall Street.

91
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:30,000
Mr Yandell, Congressman from Virginia.
Mr Kraus, Congressman from Illinois.

92
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:33,636
Hold it, everybody.
Want to get some of this brass.

93
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:35,479
Snappy little outfit you have.

94
00:08:35,522 --> 00:08:37,718
Thank you. I have to apologise for the band.

95
00:08:37,763 --> 00:08:40,754
- You should indeed.
- We're half strength today.

96
00:08:40,802 --> 00:08:43,362
- We generally have 40 pieces.
- That's terrible.

97
00:08:43,402 --> 00:08:47,316
We sent the others to the British sector
for a parade. It's Empire Day.

98
00:08:47,363 --> 00:08:51,834
What's terrible is I came hoping to find
an army taking its task with seriousness.

99
00:08:51,883 --> 00:08:54,238
Instead I find you have a 40-piece band.

100
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,638
Perhaps you also have
some drum majorettes.

101
00:08:56,683 --> 00:08:58,197
- May I introduce...
- I know.

102
00:08:58,244 --> 00:09:01,235
General Finney, General McAndrew
and Colonel Plummer.

103
00:09:01,283 --> 00:09:05,071
It's in my data. I am Miss Frost,
Congresswoman from Iowa, 9th district.

104
00:09:05,123 --> 00:09:08,719
Delightful of Congress to send us
a lady representative for a change.

105
00:09:08,764 --> 00:09:09,879
Delightful.

106
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:13,519
May I suggest here and now that
we dispense with all the soft soap.

107
00:09:13,563 --> 00:09:16,715
As committee chairman,
permit me to bring you greetings

108
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:19,677
from the people
of the United States of America.

109
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:24,560
This genial reception augurs well
for the success of our mission.

110
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:29,200
I sincerely hope so. And now let us proceed
to a luncheon we have prepared for you.

111
00:09:29,244 --> 00:09:33,875
A very simple luncheon. Powdered egg
omelette, probably, and a little Spam.

112
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:43,201
- Can I carry that for you?
- No, thank you.

113
00:09:43,246 --> 00:09:46,841
I undertook to deliver it in person
to a Captain John Pringle,

114
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:49,242
stationed somewhere in Berlin, G2 Section.

115
00:09:49,286 --> 00:09:52,278
- Could you tell me how to go about it?
- I could try.

116
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:55,636
Through army channels?
All I have is five days.

117
00:09:55,686 --> 00:09:56,756
Captain Pringle!

118
00:09:58,167 --> 00:09:59,964
Captain Pringle!

119
00:10:03,887 --> 00:10:05,638
Captain Pringle reporting, sir.

120
00:10:05,686 --> 00:10:08,405
Congresswoman Frost,
this is Captain Pringle.

121
00:10:08,446 --> 00:10:11,837
Thank you. This is for you,
Captain Pringle. Happy birthday.

122
00:10:11,887 --> 00:10:15,323
Or happy birthday yesterday.
I thought I could deliver it on time

123
00:10:15,367 --> 00:10:18,518
but we were held up
in Newfoundland for 16 hours - fog.

124
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:21,923
- You brought this from America?
- Murdoch, Iowa.

125
00:10:21,967 --> 00:10:24,162
Well, how is good old Iowa?

126
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,198
62°% Republican, thank you.

127
00:10:26,248 --> 00:10:30,639
I was entrusted with this by a constituent,
or rather, his daughter.

128
00:10:30,688 --> 00:10:33,248
I hope it's still in one piece. Open it.

129
00:10:33,288 --> 00:10:35,085
Be glad.

130
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:46,609
Well, what do you know? Little Dusty.

131
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,646
It's a beauty.

132
00:10:50,689 --> 00:10:52,681
I didn't know it was so personal.

133
00:10:52,729 --> 00:10:57,122
Her name is really Pauline Rose
but we call her Dusty. Some joke.

134
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:00,764
- How long since you've seen her?
- Dusty? Four years.

135
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:04,246
Don't these boys ever get home?
Can't they be given a short leave?

136
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,202
- Certainly, if it's accrued.
- I don't want any leave.

137
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,242
- You don't?
- Oh, of course I do. Dying to.

138
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:13,248
We're all homesick
but personal feelings don't matter.

139
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,281
There's unfinished business here.

140
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:18,482
Now that we've won the war,
we mustn't lose the peace.

141
00:11:18,531 --> 00:11:22,080
I hate to think of anybody
sitting in his lonely barracks

142
00:11:22,131 --> 00:11:23,928
with a birthday cake on his knees.

143
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:27,122
I won't have the cake on my knees.
I won't be alone.

144
00:11:28,131 --> 00:11:30,486
There'll be my buddies. I'll call them in.

145
00:11:30,531 --> 00:11:33,682
We'll open up a case of root beer,
light the candles,

146
00:11:33,731 --> 00:11:35,847
then Frankovitch and his ukulele.

147
00:11:35,891 --> 00:11:40,010
Some old songs.
Why, it'll be like back home... almost.

148
00:11:40,051 --> 00:11:41,805
Good to hear you talk like that.

149
00:11:41,852 --> 00:11:43,921
General Finney wants you to go in his car.

150
00:11:43,972 --> 00:11:45,372
I'll be right with you.

151
00:11:45,412 --> 00:11:49,963
If you're a sample of the spirit
prevailing in Berlin, I feel better already.

152
00:11:50,012 --> 00:11:52,368
- I'm a sample, all right.
- Goodbye.

153
00:11:57,452 --> 00:12:00,092
You're losing something, Captain Pringle.

154
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:02,605
My handkerchief.

155
00:12:02,653 --> 00:12:05,009
You blow your nose in nylon nowadays?

156
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:11,089
What do you know? There must have
been a mistake at the laundry.

157
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:14,729
We got a crazy old laundress.
You know what happened to Frankovitch?

158
00:12:14,774 --> 00:12:18,288
He sent out his shorts and got back a girdle.
(Laughs)

159
00:12:19,334 --> 00:12:21,210
(Groans)

160
00:12:37,095 --> 00:12:39,085
Ask her how much.

161
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:43,765
(Speaking German)

162
00:12:43,815 --> 00:12:45,807
800 cigarettes, or coffee.

163
00:12:46,775 --> 00:12:49,688
(Speaking German)

164
00:13:06,497 --> 00:13:10,284
No. This watch gold. Gold for teeth.

165
00:13:10,337 --> 00:13:12,532
- A watch from steel.
- How's this?

166
00:13:12,577 --> 00:13:15,137
No, this silver. Want steel.

167
00:13:15,177 --> 00:13:16,975
You want steel.

168
00:13:17,018 --> 00:13:21,134
No, want round watch, very big, nice face.

169
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:24,965
You're tough. All right,
let's look in the other drawer.

170
00:13:26,857 --> 00:13:30,373
(Cackles) Mickey Mouse! Mickey Mouse!

171
00:13:30,418 --> 00:13:32,408
- How much?
- $700.

172
00:13:33,418 --> 00:13:36,728
- You got three like this watch, maybe?
- We'll see.

173
00:13:45,698 --> 00:13:49,977
Herr Captain, buy porcelain?
Little Cupid to take for wife?

174
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:53,011
Never mind the knick-knacks.
How much for the mattress?

175
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:55,856
- Why you want the mattress?
- I'm sleepy.

176
00:13:55,898 --> 00:13:59,176
- How much for the mattress?
- (Speaking German)

177
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,294
What do you mean, "nein, nein, no"?

178
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:05,296
Look what you can get for it.

179
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,218
(Speaking German)

180
00:14:09,741 --> 00:14:12,891
12 eggs in it and look at
the writing on it and the candles.

181
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,331
The candles alone are worth the mattress.
Get lost.

182
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,451
(All speaking German)

183
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:40,495
(Brakes squeal)

184
00:15:40,544 --> 00:15:42,536
(Honks horn)

185
00:16:11,266 --> 00:16:13,258
Yoo-hoo!

186
00:16:14,228 --> 00:16:16,980
Erika! Erika!

187
00:16:27,388 --> 00:16:29,379
(Whistling cheerfully)

188
00:16:32,749 --> 00:16:34,704
(Speaks German)

189
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,388
Sit down, Johnny.

190
00:16:43,188 --> 00:16:45,179
Go away, Johnny, sit down.

191
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:05,301
Johnny.

192
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:07,705
Johnny, what are you doing?

193
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,786
- I'm wiping my face.
- You're hurting me, Johnny.

194
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:13,981
You're always hurting me.
Why are you so mean to me?

195
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:17,227
I worry about you. I scrounge around,
I bring you presents

196
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,908
and you tell me I'm mean to you.

197
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:22,739
You brought me a present? Where is it?
Where have you got it?

198
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,827
Ohh...

199
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:28,989
Johnny, they're so sheer. So beautiful.

200
00:17:29,031 --> 00:17:32,182
52 gauge. So I'm mean to you?

201
00:17:32,231 --> 00:17:35,382
- No, you're good to me.
- You bet I am.

202
00:17:35,431 --> 00:17:39,550
You don't know how good. I bought
you another present. You're not gonna get it.

203
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:42,741
Another one? Where have you got it?
Where is it, Johnny?

204
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:45,624
- Keep away.
- Is it here? Tell me...

205
00:17:46,912 --> 00:17:51,143
Johnny... (Speaks German)

206
00:17:51,191 --> 00:17:53,910
- Where did you get it?
- A friend of mine baked it.

207
00:17:53,951 --> 00:17:57,740
Only you're not going to get it. Why
should I care whether you sleep or not?

208
00:17:57,793 --> 00:18:01,671
Johnny, for 15 years
we haven't slept in Germany.

209
00:18:01,712 --> 00:18:05,102
First it was Hitler screaming on the radio,
then the war of nerves,

210
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:07,347
then the victory celebrations,

211
00:18:07,392 --> 00:18:09,384
then the bombing.

212
00:18:09,433 --> 00:18:11,424
All the furniture burnt.

213
00:18:11,473 --> 00:18:13,270
See?

214
00:18:13,313 --> 00:18:15,269
(Springs crash and boing)

215
00:18:15,313 --> 00:18:18,623
That one I hate worst.
Give me that mattress, Johnny.

216
00:18:18,673 --> 00:18:20,664
No mattress will help you sleep.

217
00:18:20,713 --> 00:18:23,102
What you Germans need
is a better conscience.

218
00:18:23,153 --> 00:18:24,951
I have a good conscience.

219
00:18:24,994 --> 00:18:28,145
I have a new Führer now... you.

220
00:18:28,194 --> 00:18:29,468
Heil, Johnny.

221
00:18:29,514 --> 00:18:32,153
You heil me once more
and I'll knock your teeth in.

222
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,991
You'll bruise your lips.

223
00:18:34,035 --> 00:18:37,186
Why don't I choke you a little?
Break you in two?

224
00:18:37,995 --> 00:18:40,714
Build a fire under you, you blonde witch.

225
00:18:40,755 --> 00:18:42,188
(Knock at door)

226
00:18:42,236 --> 00:18:43,827
Who's that?

227
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,866
With my luck, it's Eisenhower.

228
00:18:54,755 --> 00:18:56,746
- Yes.
- Your name Schlütow?

229
00:18:56,795 --> 00:18:59,515
- I beg your pardon.
- Is your name Erika Schlütow?

230
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,546
- No.
- You live here, don't you?

231
00:19:01,595 --> 00:19:02,994
Yes, I live here.

232
00:19:03,035 --> 00:19:05,834
You the dame that sings
at the Lorelei nightclub?

233
00:19:05,876 --> 00:19:09,471
- Yes, I sing there.
- And your name's not Erika Schlütow?

234
00:19:10,515 --> 00:19:13,155
My name is Erika von Schlütow.

235
00:19:13,196 --> 00:19:15,187
- A von?
- She's a von.

236
00:19:15,236 --> 00:19:18,035
Nobility. We beg your highness's pardon.

237
00:19:18,077 --> 00:19:20,796
- What do you want?
- A little information.

238
00:19:20,837 --> 00:19:25,672
It says here that a certain Erika Schlütow...
von Schlütow, pardon I...

239
00:19:25,717 --> 00:19:28,868
has been an active von Nazi
ever since 19 - von - 35.

240
00:19:30,157 --> 00:19:32,148
Go on, gentlemen.

241
00:19:32,198 --> 00:19:35,429
It says that Miss von Schlütow
was ordered over a month ago

242
00:19:35,478 --> 00:19:38,197
to a von labour camp
to pick up some von bricks.

243
00:19:38,238 --> 00:19:41,389
- What else does it say?
- You're working at a night joint.

244
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:44,953
According to this report,
what you're moving there ain't bricks.

245
00:19:44,998 --> 00:19:49,833
I'm an artist, gentlemen, not a street
cleaner, and I've been completely cleared.

246
00:19:49,878 --> 00:19:51,870
Yeah? Tell us all about it.

247
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,308
My case has been reviewed
and the decision reversed.

248
00:19:55,358 --> 00:19:57,554
I'm on the white list now.

249
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:03,233
With that record? If you make the white list,
we'll make the hit parade.

250
00:20:03,278 --> 00:20:05,872
- OK, von sister, get your things on.
- What for?

251
00:20:05,918 --> 00:20:09,309
We're taking you to
the von denazification office.

252
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,079
Now, Abbot and Costello,
show me your orders.

253
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,918
- Yes, sir.
- Who gave you these?

254
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,950
- Lieutenant Clark, sir.
- Four weeks old.

255
00:20:21,999 --> 00:20:23,797
We've had a lot of people to check.

256
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,230
Paperwork, that's why we're always
fouled up when a war starts.

257
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,671
Takes us six months to clear up
the paperwork from the last one.

258
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,519
I'll talk to Clark.
This case is straightened out.

259
00:20:33,561 --> 00:20:36,200
- Sorry, sir.
- OK. That's all. Take off.

260
00:20:39,721 --> 00:20:42,713
- May I have that, please?
- Sorry.

261
00:20:45,481 --> 00:20:49,600
Take an ordinary guy, make him an MP,
suddenly he gets to be eight feet tall.

262
00:20:49,642 --> 00:20:53,430
- If they look into the files for my papers.
- Stop worrying. They're OK.

263
00:20:53,482 --> 00:20:57,271
- Goodbye. I got a desk full of work.
- Did the Colonel sign my papers?

264
00:20:57,323 --> 00:21:01,109
Not exactly. He was out of the office
having his tonsils swabbed.

265
00:21:01,161 --> 00:21:04,313
- The duty officer signed them.
- Who was the duty officer?

266
00:21:04,362 --> 00:21:05,954
I was.

267
00:21:06,002 --> 00:21:09,995
Johnny, if they find out you know me,
that's very dangerous.

268
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:12,033
Everything is dangerous.

269
00:21:12,082 --> 00:21:16,554
I know an old lady back home,
broke her leg stepping into a church pew.

270
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,240
See you, baby.

271
00:21:21,923 --> 00:21:25,075
Johnny! When you come back,
bring me some sugar.

272
00:21:25,124 --> 00:21:26,921
- Yeah, sure.
- And some soap.

273
00:21:26,963 --> 00:21:28,955
And hairpins.

274
00:21:29,004 --> 00:21:32,792
- Anything else?
- A pillow to go with that mattress.

275
00:21:33,563 --> 00:21:36,123
Ah, you gorgeous booby trap.

276
00:21:37,445 --> 00:21:38,923
Yahoo!

277
00:21:40,325 --> 00:21:42,155
(Siren wailing)

278
00:21:44,164 --> 00:21:46,235
On your left is the Russian war memorial,

279
00:21:46,285 --> 00:21:49,595
built in honour of their soldiers
killed in the battle of Berlin.

280
00:21:49,645 --> 00:21:52,604
Those tanks on the side
were the first to enter Berlin.

281
00:21:53,526 --> 00:21:57,120
Beyond it, the Reichstag,
the German house of representatives.

282
00:21:57,166 --> 00:22:01,284
That's the building set on fire in 1933
and blamed on a poor Dutchman.

283
00:22:01,326 --> 00:22:04,044
The word got out it was Hitler
who threw the match.

284
00:22:04,085 --> 00:22:09,159
They used to say it's the first time in history
a man gave himself the hotfoot.

285
00:22:09,205 --> 00:22:11,197
(Siren wailing)

286
00:22:13,486 --> 00:22:18,321
The Brandenburg Gate, an arch of triumph
until they got out of the habit.

287
00:22:18,366 --> 00:22:21,756
That rubble heap over there
was the American embassy.

288
00:22:21,806 --> 00:22:24,958
You can't tell now but this spot
was once the heart of Europe.

289
00:22:25,007 --> 00:22:27,202
The street is the famous Unter den Linden,

290
00:22:27,247 --> 00:22:30,842
named after the linden trees,
which they've replanted now.

291
00:22:30,887 --> 00:22:33,526
That pile of stone over there
was the Adlon Hotel,

292
00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:37,162
just after the 8th Air Force
checked in for the weekend.

293
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:39,767
Now, let's look at the Wilhelmstraße.

294
00:22:39,807 --> 00:22:41,320
(Siren wailing)

295
00:22:41,367 --> 00:22:45,202
Here's the Reich Chancellery where
the Führer fixed himself up a duplex.

296
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:49,366
As it turned out, one part got to be a big
padded cell and the other a mortuary.

297
00:22:49,408 --> 00:22:51,399
Underneath is a concrete basement,

298
00:22:51,449 --> 00:22:54,884
where he married Eva Braun
and where they killed themselves.

299
00:22:54,928 --> 00:22:57,921
A lot of people say it was
the perfect honeymoon.

300
00:22:59,249 --> 00:23:04,085
Over there is the balcony where he bet
his Reich would last a thousand years.

301
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:07,280
That's the one that broke
the bookies' hearts.

302
00:23:09,728 --> 00:23:13,847
This is the Tiergarten,
used to be the Central Park of Berlin.

303
00:23:13,889 --> 00:23:18,360
Those two big cement things are
the zoo bunkers, enormous pillboxes.

304
00:23:18,409 --> 00:23:21,560
They were the last two buildings
in Berlin to surrender.

305
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:45,525
I thought you'd be interested
in a typical Berlin residential area.

306
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:48,723
If you look hard,
you'll see the houses are empty shells,

307
00:23:48,772 --> 00:23:51,729
completely burned out by incendiaries.

308
00:23:51,771 --> 00:23:54,411
Life goes on in those ruins, though.

309
00:24:12,292 --> 00:24:15,204
That used to be
the largest department store in Berlin.

310
00:24:15,252 --> 00:24:20,327
It was 12 storeys high. Later on it became
headquarters for the storm troopers.

311
00:24:20,373 --> 00:24:25,447
They blew it up themselves.
The idea was to destroy all their records.

312
00:24:25,493 --> 00:24:29,964
They overlooked the fact that most
of them were in fireproof vaults.

313
00:24:49,975 --> 00:24:51,771
Excuse me.

314
00:24:57,214 --> 00:24:58,853
Well.

315
00:24:59,734 --> 00:25:03,524
This is one of our youth clubs. We've
got a lot of them in the American zone.

316
00:25:03,576 --> 00:25:07,693
We had quite a problem. Those weren't
ordinary youngsters when we came in.

317
00:25:07,735 --> 00:25:11,934
They were mean old men. Now we're
trying to make kids of them again.

318
00:25:11,976 --> 00:25:15,571
We had to kick the goose step out of them
and cure them of blind obedience

319
00:25:15,616 --> 00:25:17,686
and teach them to beep at the referee.

320
00:25:17,736 --> 00:25:20,374
If they want to steal,
make sure it's second base.

321
00:25:22,616 --> 00:25:25,130
(Cheering)

322
00:25:25,176 --> 00:25:28,964
One thing they don't have to worry about
round here, breaking windows.

323
00:25:29,017 --> 00:25:32,327
One family has already
christened a kid DiMaggio Schultz.

324
00:25:32,377 --> 00:25:34,937
That's when I started believing
we'd won the war.

325
00:25:37,137 --> 00:25:40,129
- (Shouts in German)

328
00:25:51,457 --> 00:25:54,256
Hey, Fräulein! Hey, Fräulein!

329
00:26:03,339 --> 00:26:05,727
(Laughing) No, no, no.

330
00:26:05,778 --> 00:26:09,977
Come on. What's the matter with you two?
Just a little Spazierfahren in the park.

331
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:13,694
Nein, we don't bicycle. We automobile.
(Both laugh)

332
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,780
Automobile? You got yourselves officers?

333
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:20,210
- (Speaking German)
- French officers.

334
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:23,855
OK. So they got an automobile
but we got the candy bar.

335
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,890
(Speaking German)

336
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,334
Ah, your Führer's moustache.

337
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:41,253
Hey, Doctor, I got a lady on the balcony.

338
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,092
Size 14.

339
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,496
Hey, Fräulein! Hey, Fräulein!

340
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:50,933
Hey, Fräulein! Stop, Fräulein!

341
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,820
- Guten afternoon, Fräulein.
- Hello, Fräulein.

342
00:26:55,861 --> 00:26:57,658
(Giggles)

343
00:26:57,701 --> 00:27:00,660
Das is my friend Brigadier General Mike.

344
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,896
And das is mein Freund,
Lieutenant General Joe.

345
00:27:02,941 --> 00:27:04,216
Jawohl.

346
00:27:04,262 --> 00:27:06,616
You know, you're a nice little strudel.

347
00:27:06,661 --> 00:27:08,857
Hey, hands off. I saw her first.

348
00:27:08,902 --> 00:27:09,938
(Giggles)

349
00:27:09,983 --> 00:27:12,701
Fräulein, would you like
a little Spaßmachen,

350
00:27:12,742 --> 00:27:16,451
- Biertrinken and Tanzen making?
- Jawohl.

351
00:27:16,502 --> 00:27:19,892
She must be tetched in the wool.
All she can say is, "Jawohl".

352
00:27:19,942 --> 00:27:22,981
(All laugh)

353

358
00:27:40,304 --> 00:27:43,295
Don't give her that candy bar yet.
Are you crazy?

359
00:27:43,343 --> 00:27:47,132
- I ain't giving. I'm just showing.
- Say, was ist your name?

360
00:27:47,184 --> 00:27:50,301
(Speaking German)

361
00:27:50,344 --> 00:27:52,540

- Four packs.

369
00:28:50,387 --> 00:28:53,777
Five packs for champagne,
three for wine, one for beer.

370
00:28:53,827 --> 00:28:57,740
This is eine kleine clip joint. Here's your tip.

371
00:28:57,788 --> 00:29:01,781
How do you like these prices? We got
to write Congress to boost our PX ration.

372
00:29:01,828 --> 00:29:06,299
Fat chance. All them schmoes think about
is coal strikes, flood control, United Nations.

373
00:29:06,348 --> 00:29:09,943
What's Congress? A bunch of salesmen
with their foot in the right door.

374
00:29:09,988 --> 00:29:12,822
For my dough, you can have
Congress and the Senate.

375
00:29:12,869 --> 00:29:14,825
- I'll take it.

Hey, Gretchen, you live with your mother?
(Speaking German)

Look, what do you want, the whole family?

383

Listen, if anybody's dancing...
Come on, Gesundheit.

461
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:12,363
- What's the matter?
- Let go of me, you ape.

462
00:35:12,407 --> 00:35:15,240
- What kind of language...
- I said ape and I meant ape.

463
00:35:15,287 --> 00:35:17,040
Hey! Hey!

464
00:35:19,289 --> 00:35:21,883
- Where did you get that cake?
- (Joe) Hey, Mike.

465
00:35:21,929 --> 00:35:23,920
I demand to know where you got that cake.

466
00:35:23,969 --> 00:35:25,959
(Man) What you want?

467
00:35:26,008 --> 00:35:29,161
Where'd this restaurant get food?
Our business, not yours.

468
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,608
I'm making it my business.

469
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:34,641
I happen to know all about that cake

470
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:37,841
and I am a Congresswoman
of the United States of America.

471
00:35:38,449 --> 00:35:41,168
- Some strudel you picked.
- Yeah, let's go.

472
00:35:45,331 --> 00:35:47,526
Put back that slice of the cake.

473
00:35:47,571 --> 00:35:50,369
Take out the knife.
I want to know what it is doing here.

474
00:35:50,411 --> 00:35:52,605
- It is being eaten.
- That's enough.

475
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,641
- This cake is confiscated.
- Hello.

476
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:58,081
- How do you do? So that's where it is.
- What do you know about this?

477
00:35:58,131 --> 00:36:00,247
Very little. It was stolen out of my Jeep.

478
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:03,203
- It was?
- Stolen and sold on the black market.

479
00:36:03,251 --> 00:36:05,811
They'll steal anything around here.

480
00:36:05,851 --> 00:36:09,447
- When I think of that girl back in Iowa...
- Yeah.

481
00:36:09,492 --> 00:36:12,052
I'll take care of this. Don't trouble yourself.

482
00:36:12,092 --> 00:36:16,209
Thank you. Will you also take care
of a pair of disgusting soldiers

483
00:36:16,251 --> 00:36:18,970
who should be stood up against a wall and...

484
00:36:19,972 --> 00:36:21,370
Oh.

485
00:36:21,411 --> 00:36:25,485
I want you to find them.
They're medium height. One is a little taller.

486
00:36:25,532 --> 00:36:29,650
Their names are Mike and Joe and
they're in uniforms with US on the collar.

487
00:36:29,692 --> 00:36:30,967
Perfect sense, ma'am.

488
00:36:31,012 --> 00:36:33,527
Now, what exactly is
the name of this sewer?

489
00:36:33,573 --> 00:36:35,131
- The Lorelei.
- Address?

490
00:36:35,173 --> 00:36:38,688
- Number 15, Hagenbachstraße.
- Are there other sewers like this?

491
00:36:38,733 --> 00:36:42,248
- Three or four but this is the best.
- What is the name of that woman?

492
00:36:42,293 --> 00:36:44,011
- What woman?
- The singer here.

493
00:36:44,053 --> 00:36:47,090
Oh, the singer. I think it's Erika.

494
00:36:47,133 --> 00:36:50,524
- Erika what?
- Erika von Schlütow.

495
00:36:50,574 --> 00:36:51,973
Why do you ask about her?

496
00:36:52,014 --> 00:36:56,485
Because there's something funny going on
here and I'm not in the mood for laughs.

497
00:36:56,534 --> 00:36:58,728
Schlütow? How do you spell it?

498
00:36:58,773 --> 00:37:00,765
Schlütow, with an umlaut.

499
00:37:00,814 --> 00:37:02,806
I thought so.

500
00:37:06,094 --> 00:37:08,892
I want you to remember
that when we moved into Germany,

501
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:11,847
we found a country of
open graves and closed hearts.

502
00:37:11,895 --> 00:37:14,694
We've tried to turn it into a civilised state.

503
00:37:14,736 --> 00:37:18,331
We had to eliminate things
that breed unrest and aggression.

504
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:21,526
We've tried to make them free men
and give them some dignity.

505
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:25,364
We had to return four million
displaced persons to their homes.

506
00:37:25,416 --> 00:37:28,055
That's hard if you don't have
a home to start with.

507
00:37:28,096 --> 00:37:31,133
We had to repair hospitals
and public utilities.

508
00:37:31,176 --> 00:37:34,565
I remember the first day the gasworks
started operating again.

509
00:37:34,615 --> 00:37:38,005
There were 160 suicides in Berlin alone.

510
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:39,853
That was ten months ago.

511
00:37:39,896 --> 00:37:44,015
Today, they take a match and light
the gas and boil some potatoes.

512
00:37:44,057 --> 00:37:47,652
Not many potatoes, mind you.
There is still a lot of hunger.

513
00:37:47,697 --> 00:37:49,813
But there is a new will to live.

514
00:37:49,857 --> 00:37:54,327
We had to build schools and find teachers
and then teach the teachers.

515
00:37:54,377 --> 00:37:58,496
We helped them start a free press
and institute a parliamentary government.

516
00:37:58,537 --> 00:38:01,098
They had their first free election in 14 years.

517
00:38:01,138 --> 00:38:03,572
It had been so long
they didn't know what to do.

518
00:38:03,618 --> 00:38:06,768
It was like handing
the village drunk a glass of water.

519
00:38:07,778 --> 00:38:12,249
What I want to point out is that
it's a tough, thankless, lonely job.

520
00:38:12,298 --> 00:38:14,494
We're trying to lick it as well as we can.

521
00:38:14,539 --> 00:38:17,928
You might as well know,
some of us get out of line occasionally.

522
00:38:17,978 --> 00:38:20,539
But remember this.
For the first time in history,

523
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:25,208
you are asking the same generation of
soldiers to be both valorous and wise.

524
00:38:25,258 --> 00:38:27,056
- Mighty fine.
- Well said.

525
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:30,693
I sure hope our chairman has
made notes of that speech of yours.

526
00:38:30,738 --> 00:38:33,377
I think it should be
incorporated in our report.

527
00:38:33,418 --> 00:38:36,570
Colonel, we buy every word of it, all of us.

528
00:38:36,619 --> 00:38:38,132
I don't.

529
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:43,536
I wouldn't think of buying it. I'm surprised
at my colleagues' low sales resistance.

530
00:38:43,579 --> 00:38:46,969
Miss Frost, this attitude calls
for some explanation.

531
00:38:47,019 --> 00:38:49,215
Colonel Plummer, in your eloquent speech,

532
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,455
which I'm sure you've made 50 times,

533
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:55,289
you used the phrase "Some of our boys
may get out of line sometimes."

534
00:38:55,341 --> 00:38:57,535
That is a masterpiece of understatement.

535
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,094
What are you driving at?

536
00:38:59,141 --> 00:39:03,771
In your effort to civilise this country,
our boys are becoming barbarians.

537
00:39:03,821 --> 00:39:06,972
- I explained on that tour...
- I know all about those tours.

538
00:39:07,021 --> 00:39:11,413
You put blinkers on us and make sure
we only see what you want us to see.

539
00:39:11,462 --> 00:39:15,057
Then you give us pamphlets,
statistics, a rousing speech

540
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:18,093
and ship us back a little more
bamboozled than when we came.

541
00:39:18,141 --> 00:39:20,860
We could have learned
as much from Reader's Digest.

542
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:24,292
- This is very embarrassing, Colonel.
- Go on, Miss Frost.

543
00:39:24,342 --> 00:39:27,176
Well, I don't like blinkers.
I look in all directions

544
00:39:27,223 --> 00:39:31,658
and when I suspect dirt's been swept
under a carpet, I turn up that carpet.

545
00:39:31,701 --> 00:39:34,854
- What carpet? What dirt?
- What dirt?

546
00:39:34,903 --> 00:39:39,134
- One day and this is filled with it.
- Please particularise.

547
00:39:39,182 --> 00:39:41,902
Gls consorting with German Fräuleins...

548
00:39:41,943 --> 00:39:43,376
Fraternisation is legal.

549
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:47,098
...in wide-open, shameless,
black-market nightclubs.

550
00:39:48,104 --> 00:39:51,892
So we close them and our boys sneak off
to places in the Russian sector,

551
00:39:51,944 --> 00:39:54,980
or the British, or in the French,
and there's another thing.

552
00:39:55,023 --> 00:39:58,061
This is off the record.
Those places attract a lot of scum

553
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:01,700
and we clean it up by cracking down
with a surprise raid once in a while.

554
00:40:01,745 --> 00:40:05,862
Notorious Nazi entertainers parading
themselves before our boys,

555
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:08,816
- is that off the record too?
- For instance?

556
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:13,256
I am specifically referring
to one Erika von Schlütow,

557
00:40:13,305 --> 00:40:18,299
who works at a dive called the Lorelei,
15 Hagenbachstraße.

558
00:40:18,345 --> 00:40:19,903
How can a creature...

559
00:40:25,106 --> 00:40:27,667
I insist on a satisfactory explanation.

560
00:40:27,707 --> 00:40:31,494
I must ask the Congresswoman
to drop this particular matter.

561
00:40:31,546 --> 00:40:34,743
- Why?
- Some things must be left to our discretion.

562
00:40:34,786 --> 00:40:39,257
Colonel Plummer, I didn't go for
the blinkers. Now, don't try a muzzle.

563
00:40:39,306 --> 00:40:42,696
The last time someone wanted to gag me,
he tried it with a mink coat

564
00:40:42,746 --> 00:40:48,297
but I never let go until the president of that
particular ship company wound up in jail,

565
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:51,338
even though I did get
pneumonia that winter.

566
00:40:53,866 --> 00:40:56,859
Herr Maier, this is the second time
we've had complaints.

567
00:40:56,907 --> 00:41:00,183
I don't think it's a good idea
that your son... What's his name?

568
00:41:00,227 --> 00:41:01,262
Gerhard.

569
00:41:01,307 --> 00:41:05,778
That Gerhard should draw swastikas
all over the neighbourhood.

570
00:41:05,828 --> 00:41:08,136
(Chastises in German)

571
00:41:08,187 --> 00:41:11,464
- I will break his arm.
- We've dissolved the Gestapo.

572
00:41:11,507 --> 00:41:15,979
No food, Bürschchen.
I will lock him into a dark room.

573
00:41:16,028 --> 00:41:18,019
Why not just shove him in a gas chamber?

574
00:41:18,068 --> 00:41:19,103
Yes, Herr Kapitän.

575
00:41:19,148 --> 00:41:21,868
Listen, we've done away
with concentration camps.

576
00:41:21,909 --> 00:41:25,264
Take him round to a G YA,
one of our German youth clubs.

577
00:41:25,308 --> 00:41:28,904
Some baseball and a little less
heel-clicking is what he needs.

578
00:41:28,949 --> 00:41:31,144
Here's the address. Ask for Sergeant Breen.

579
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:32,986
Yes, Herr Kapitän.

580
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:36,587
I mean, thank you, Herr Kapitän.

581
00:41:36,629 --> 00:41:38,506
Auf Wiedersehen.

582
00:41:38,549 --> 00:41:40,540
Come, Bürschchen.

583
00:41:47,349 --> 00:41:50,342
- Captain Pringle is wanted in 112.
- Who's that?

584
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:52,950
That Congress dame,
whatever her name is.

585
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:54,581
- Wants to see me?
- You, sir.

586
00:41:54,629 --> 00:41:56,825
- Now?
- Now. She's clucking like a hen.

587
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:59,986
You'd better get there
before she lays an egg.

588
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:18,431
- Captain Pringle reporting.
- Hello.

589
00:42:19,232 --> 00:42:22,429
- Lorelei, how do you spell it?
- Lorelei?

590
00:42:22,472 --> 00:42:24,463
l-E or E-I at the end?

591
00:42:24,512 --> 00:42:26,104
E-I.

592
00:42:26,152 --> 00:42:27,949
Thank you.

593
00:42:30,392 --> 00:42:34,511
Captain Pringle, my belief in the army
has been shaken to the core.

594
00:42:34,553 --> 00:42:37,750
- Really?
- I can't trust anybody in uniform.

595
00:42:37,793 --> 00:42:39,350
Now, please...

596
00:42:39,392 --> 00:42:41,952
With one single exception, you.

597
00:42:42,913 --> 00:42:44,028
Thank you, ma'am.

598
00:42:44,073 --> 00:42:46,267
I trust you because we're both Iowans.

599
00:42:46,312 --> 00:42:49,907
- Right back at you, Miss Frost.
- Moreover, you're a hard worker.

600
00:42:49,952 --> 00:42:52,308
Perhaps you work too hard. You look tired.

601
00:42:52,353 --> 00:42:54,548
Well, I hoped it didn't show.

602
00:42:56,193 --> 00:42:58,549
That is ink, Captain Pringle.

603
00:42:58,594 --> 00:42:59,821
So it is.

604
00:42:59,873 --> 00:43:01,353
Captain, I need your help.

605
00:43:01,393 --> 00:43:05,227
I want some additional data
on Fräulein von Schlütow.

606
00:43:05,273 --> 00:43:06,708
The one with the umlaut.

607
00:43:06,754 --> 00:43:10,382
- Oh, her.
- There must be a file on that woman.

608
00:43:10,434 --> 00:43:14,028
- Of course there is. Only it's not here.
- It isn't?

609
00:43:14,073 --> 00:43:16,713
I asked for it
and I was told it's gone to Nürnberg.

610
00:43:16,754 --> 00:43:19,906
On account of the trials,
a lot of files have been sent there.

611
00:43:19,955 --> 00:43:21,752
- I see.
- I asked around, though.

612
00:43:21,795 --> 00:43:24,627
- Did you find anything?
- Nothing important. Gossip.

613
00:43:24,674 --> 00:43:27,313
Are you sure? No fire with all that smoke?

614
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:30,268
She may have known
a couple of minor party members.

615
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:33,114
Nothing worth your attention.
Small fry, I'd say.

616
00:43:33,156 --> 00:43:35,795
- All right, ma'am, we're ready to go.
- Thank you.

617
00:43:35,836 --> 00:43:38,829
A warrant officer said he'd seen her
in an old newsreel,

618
00:43:38,877 --> 00:43:41,437
so I sent for the film from the Signal Corp.

619
00:43:45,636 --> 00:43:47,434
(Pringle) The Week In Pictures.

620
00:43:50,277 --> 00:43:53,426
This is a little Nazi get-together in Breslau.

621
00:43:58,756 --> 00:44:02,545
That's Goebbels telling them
how they're winning the war.

622
00:44:07,238 --> 00:44:10,150
Opening of the opera with Lohengrin
and famous guests.

623
00:44:10,197 --> 00:44:12,587
(Frost) They fiddled big while Berlin burned.

624
00:44:12,638 --> 00:44:15,311
Lohengrin, you know, swan song.

625
00:44:18,798 --> 00:44:23,475
(Frost) Now we're getting someplace.
I wonder what holds up that dress.

626
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:26,033
(Pringle) Must be that German willpower.

627
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:28,513
(Frost) Who's that man?
(Pringle) I think it's Birgel.

628
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:31,027
(Frost) Who?
(Pringle) Hans Otto Birgel.

629
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:33,069
(Frost) Who is Hans Otto Birgel?

630
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,555
(Pringle) He had something to do
with the Gestapo. He's dead.

631
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:42,277
- Killed himself when the Russians came.
- (Frost) An important party member?

632
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:44,116
(Pringle) So-so.

633
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:47,118
(Frost) Well, she must be his girlfriend.

634
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,799
Maybe she doesn't know him.
Maybe she had a dizzy spell

635
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:52,718
and the first thing she could catch
was his... elbow.

636
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,356
(Frost) That's enough. Thank you.

637
00:45:22,521 --> 00:45:26,515
Well, we've learned one thing.
No small fry is she.

638
00:45:26,562 --> 00:45:29,599
- I guess not.
- That a Nazi woman like that should...

639
00:45:29,642 --> 00:45:32,793
I'll see she discontinues
her appearances as an entertainer.

640
00:45:32,842 --> 00:45:35,037
- Will that be satisfactory?
- It will not.

641
00:45:35,082 --> 00:45:37,643
What would you suggest, shave her head?

642
00:45:37,683 --> 00:45:39,274
- I'm not after her head.
- Well?

643
00:45:39,322 --> 00:45:42,918
It's common talk that an officer
in the army is protecting her.

644
00:45:42,963 --> 00:45:46,353
- It's his head I'm after.
- You really think an officer?

645
00:45:46,403 --> 00:45:48,200
Incredible as it may seem.

646
00:45:48,243 --> 00:45:50,438
Now, let's use some common sense.

647
00:45:50,483 --> 00:45:54,078
That man is not giving her
his protection for platonic reasons.

648
00:45:54,123 --> 00:45:56,115
- Granted?
- Granted.

649
00:45:56,164 --> 00:45:58,519
Of course the association is undercover.

650
00:45:58,564 --> 00:46:01,476
He's not stupid enough
to entertain her at his billet.

651
00:46:01,524 --> 00:46:05,311
- I guess that's right.
- We can therefore assume he visits her.

652
00:46:05,363 --> 00:46:07,354
Very logical.

653
00:46:07,403 --> 00:46:10,793
Therefore, to catch him,
we must watch her place.

654
00:46:10,843 --> 00:46:12,640
Smart idea.

655
00:46:12,683 --> 00:46:15,402
- You know where she lives?
- I can find out.

656
00:46:15,443 --> 00:46:18,595
And I shall watch it
day and night... personally.

657
00:46:18,644 --> 00:46:21,204
No, we'll watch it together, the two of us.

658
00:46:21,244 --> 00:46:24,635
- We will?
- Yes. I want to be an eyewitness.

659
00:46:24,685 --> 00:46:28,121
I want to see that man myself
and face him down.

660
00:46:28,165 --> 00:46:30,520
Can you afford the time, Miss Frost?

661
00:46:30,565 --> 00:46:34,160
Any time it requires.
This I intend to make my case in point.

662
00:46:34,205 --> 00:46:36,002
You'll go to the General?

663
00:46:36,045 --> 00:46:40,038
I will, and to the War Department
and to the President.

664
00:46:40,886 --> 00:46:44,037
And if that doesn't do it,
I'll see Gabriel Heater.

665
00:46:55,886 --> 00:46:59,277
It's well after curfew.
I wonder if he's coming tonight.

666
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:02,046
- He'll be here.
- Yeah?

667
00:47:02,087 --> 00:47:05,363
I don't think you understand
about arrangements like this.

668
00:47:05,407 --> 00:47:07,966
They work 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.

669
00:47:08,006 --> 00:47:09,998
Does the CIO know about this?

670
00:47:13,167 --> 00:47:16,318
Are you sure there aren't
any back stairs to that apartment?

671
00:47:16,367 --> 00:47:17,959
There isn't even any back wall.

672
00:47:18,007 --> 00:47:21,000
She must be waiting for somebody.
Why leave the lights on?

673
00:47:21,048 --> 00:47:24,119
Maybe she's knitting
or putting up pickled peaches.

674
00:47:24,728 --> 00:47:26,718
Only we know better.

675
00:47:31,328 --> 00:47:33,285
Pickled peaches.

676
00:47:34,449 --> 00:47:37,997
I bet you miss Iowa. I do already.

677
00:47:39,449 --> 00:47:42,600
- It's changed since you've been there.
- Yeah?

678
00:47:42,649 --> 00:47:45,526
A lot has happened, especially in Murdoch.

679
00:47:45,569 --> 00:47:48,288
- Do you remember Union Street?
- Mm-hm.

680
00:47:48,329 --> 00:47:52,800
Well, they've changed the name.
Now it's called Iwo Jima Boulevard.

681
00:47:52,849 --> 00:47:56,001
- That's news.
- And there was a post office scandal.

682
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:59,646
- Yeah?
- About the new mural in the post office.

683
00:47:59,691 --> 00:48:02,250
The town collected $2,000 to hire a painter.

684
00:48:02,291 --> 00:48:05,442
The mayor got his cousin
from Chicago to do it.

685
00:48:05,491 --> 00:48:07,686
- That's nice.
- It was 80 feet long.

686
00:48:07,731 --> 00:48:09,607
Supposed to be Custer's last stand.

687
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:13,245
After the cousin left town,
they found out it wasn't an original.

688
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:15,929
He copied the whole thing from a beer ad.

689
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:17,403
(Pringle) Hm.

690
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:21,808
- There was an awful lot of trouble.
- You take Iowa seriously, don't you?

691
00:48:21,851 --> 00:48:24,206
Yes, I guess I do. I like it. Don't you?

692
00:48:24,251 --> 00:48:25,683
Mm-hm.

693
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:29,122
We won a lot of honours last year,
all the 4H prizes.

694
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:30,763
It's getting a little chilly.

695
00:48:30,811 --> 00:48:34,202
We had the lowest juvenile delinquency rate
until two months ago.

696
00:48:34,252 --> 00:48:35,321
What happened?

697
00:48:35,372 --> 00:48:38,522
A boy in Des Moines took
a blowtorch to his grandmother.

698
00:48:38,571 --> 00:48:41,722
We fell clear down to 16th place.
It was humiliating.

699
00:48:41,771 --> 00:48:43,683
(Horn honks)

700
00:48:51,093 --> 00:48:52,924
(Key clinks)

701
00:48:52,973 --> 00:48:54,564
What's that?

702
00:48:54,612 --> 00:48:57,332
- Crickets.
- Something dropped.

703
00:48:57,373 --> 00:48:59,933
- How's that?
- Something metallic.

704
00:48:59,973 --> 00:49:01,770
Metallic?

705
00:49:07,174 --> 00:49:08,971
Look, it's a key.

706
00:49:09,014 --> 00:49:11,209
A key? Whatever for?

707
00:49:11,254 --> 00:49:14,406
Evidently the man honks the horn
and that's the signal.

708
00:49:14,455 --> 00:49:16,809
You know more about
these things than I do.

709
00:49:16,855 --> 00:49:18,844
(Erika) Johnny? Johnny?

710
00:49:23,614 --> 00:49:25,605
Where are you, Johnny?

711
00:49:26,413 --> 00:49:27,847
Johnny?

712
00:49:31,494 --> 00:49:34,645
- Johnny.
- There are a lot of Johnnys in the army.

713
00:49:34,694 --> 00:49:36,890
- Now we're getting someplace.
- Where?

714
00:49:36,935 --> 00:49:40,086
This eliminates all the Jims,
the Bobs and the Georges.

715
00:49:40,135 --> 00:49:42,126
Too bad his name isn't Zachary.

716
00:49:42,175 --> 00:49:44,167
Yes, that would simplify it.

717
00:49:44,216 --> 00:49:46,251
(Door opening)

718
00:49:58,616 --> 00:50:00,015
Johnny.

719
00:50:02,817 --> 00:50:05,808
I... don't know who you refer to.

720
00:50:05,856 --> 00:50:07,450
I am Captain Pringle

721
00:50:07,497 --> 00:50:11,615
and I have with me a member
of the Congress of the United States.

722
00:50:12,658 --> 00:50:14,455
Good evening.

723
00:50:14,498 --> 00:50:17,296
- You are Erika von Schlütow?
- I am.

724
00:50:17,338 --> 00:50:20,966
We have reason to believe you're
consorting with a member of our army.

725
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:24,486
- You have?
- We think you're expecting him now.

726
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,350
- What gives you that idea?
- The key you dropped.

727
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,792
- Maybe I dropped it for the milkman.
- Oh.

728
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,436
She dropped it for the milkman.

729
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:39,032
Fräulein, if that's supposed to be a joke,
you're joking up the wrong tree.

730
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,960
Let me assure you,
we are in no mood for flippancy.

731
00:50:42,002 --> 00:50:44,594
- Facts, if you please.
- Yes, facts.

732
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,394
- You are an American woman?
- We'll ask the questions.

733
00:50:49,442 --> 00:50:51,800
- What is the name of the man?
- Yes.

734
00:50:51,842 --> 00:50:54,038
- Johnny.
- Johnny what?

735
00:50:54,086 --> 00:50:56,641
I see you do not believe in lipstick.

736
00:50:56,683 --> 00:51:00,277
And what a curious way to do your hair,
or rather not to do it.

737
00:51:00,325 --> 00:51:02,965
Wait a minute.
Do you know who you're taking to?

738
00:51:03,001 --> 00:51:07,477
An American woman, and I'm a little
disappointed, to tell you the truth.

739
00:51:07,525 --> 00:51:11,197
We apparently have a false idea
about the chic American woman.

740
00:51:11,245 --> 00:51:15,919
- I suppose it's publicity from Hollywood.
- You're being impertinent.

741
00:51:15,967 --> 00:51:20,119
Well, I must go back now. There's
a curfew for German civilians, you know.

742
00:51:20,167 --> 00:51:21,919
There sure is.

743
00:51:21,967 --> 00:51:25,357
Fräulein von Schlütow,
we increased our national debt

744
00:51:25,405 --> 00:51:30,877
by some $350 billion to win this war.
I would regard it as a waste

745
00:51:30,925 --> 00:51:34,315
- if we didn't eliminate types like you.
- Like you.

746
00:51:38,407 --> 00:51:42,877
Perhaps if you would change
the line of your eyebrows a little.

747
00:51:42,925 --> 00:51:44,917
Gute Nacht.

748
00:51:44,965 --> 00:51:48,121
Gute Nacht,
Captain... whatever your name is.

749
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:55,524
What nerve. What colossal nerve.

750
00:51:55,566 --> 00:51:58,722
We have to remember what
they've been through.

751
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:01,806
All those bombings left them
kind of wobbly up here.

752
00:52:01,848 --> 00:52:04,650
- I do look awful without make-up.
- You don't.

753
00:52:04,692 --> 00:52:07,680
We were only allowed 60lbs of luggage.
No nonessentials.

754
00:52:07,728 --> 00:52:12,120
Never listen to another woman if you want
to know how you look. Ask a man.

755
00:52:12,168 --> 00:52:14,526
- Come on, ask me.
- I know how I look.

756
00:52:14,568 --> 00:52:19,008
You look charming, positively,
definitely, absolutely charming...

757
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:21,408
in a... refreshing sort of way.

758
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:24,012
- Are you being polite?
- Who wants perfume?

759
00:52:24,054 --> 00:52:28,524
Give me the fresh wet smell
of Iowa corn right after it rains.

760
00:52:28,572 --> 00:52:31,404
We had little rain this year,
wonderful corn weather.

761
00:52:31,452 --> 00:52:33,408
I'm sure glad to hear that.

762
00:52:34,212 --> 00:52:36,852
- Now to get back to that woman.
- Must we?

763
00:52:36,894 --> 00:52:39,804
To be as insulting as that,
she must feel awfully safe.

764
00:52:39,852 --> 00:52:41,448
Or just bluffing.

765
00:52:41,496 --> 00:52:44,646
The man behind her
must be really important.

766
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:46,890
A general or a colonel.

767
00:52:46,932 --> 00:52:48,888
A colonel at least.

768
00:52:50,532 --> 00:52:52,890
What's the full name of that colonel?

769
00:52:52,932 --> 00:52:55,493
- Colonel?
- That Colonel Plummer.

770
00:52:55,535 --> 00:52:57,329
- Rufus J Plummer.
- J for what?

771
00:52:57,371 --> 00:52:59,363
J for John.

772
00:52:59,417 --> 00:53:00,893
Do you think?

773
00:53:00,935 --> 00:53:05,051
No, not him. It couldn't be him.
He's a married man. A West Pointer.

774
00:53:05,093 --> 00:53:07,655
I've heard of married men,
of West Pointers, even.

775
00:53:07,697 --> 00:53:11,813
- But not Plummer, ma'am, I swear.
- There was a look in his eye.

776
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:15,641
If we could only get our hands on her file.
Who told you it was sent to Nürnberg?

777
00:53:15,695 --> 00:53:20,087
- Second Lieutenant Cook, in charge of files.
- Maybe he's covering up for his colonel.

778
00:53:20,135 --> 00:53:23,813
- I'll ask him tomorrow morning.
- No. We'll go there now.

779
00:53:23,855 --> 00:53:25,451
- Where?
- To the files.

780
00:53:25,499 --> 00:53:28,295
In the middle of the night?
Shouldn't we get permission?

781
00:53:28,337 --> 00:53:31,727
Did we get permission
to land in Normandy? Let's go.

782
00:53:45,299 --> 00:53:48,095
Schlütow, Schlütow.

783
00:53:48,137 --> 00:53:50,129
S... SA...

784
00:53:54,023 --> 00:53:56,740
SCH to ST. This is where it would be.

785
00:53:56,782 --> 00:53:58,576
If it is at all, but I don't think it is.

786
00:53:58,618 --> 00:54:01,180
- Well, let's make good and sure.
- Sure.

787
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:05,056
Come on, open it.

788
00:54:05,098 --> 00:54:08,698
Schlage, Schlangenberg,
Schlagenspitz, Schlitz...

789
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:11,890
Seems that some of them
never got to Milwaukee.

790
00:54:12,742 --> 00:54:15,460
Schliemann, Schlüssel, Schlütow...

791
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,494
- There.
- Here's the Schlütows.

792
00:54:17,542 --> 00:54:23,140
Anton, Emil, Fritz, Gottfried, Waldemar...

793
00:54:23,182 --> 00:54:25,174
- No Erika.
- No Erika.

794
00:54:25,222 --> 00:54:28,258
Told you so. Gone to Nürnberg.
Gone to Nürnberg.

795
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:30,496
I'll take you back to your billet.

796
00:54:31,426 --> 00:54:33,382
Erika von Schlütow.

797
00:54:33,424 --> 00:54:35,218
- Yes?
- It's under von.

798
00:54:35,266 --> 00:54:36,664
Oh, no.

799
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:40,096
Like O'Brien. You wouldn't
look under B, you'd look under O.

800
00:54:40,144 --> 00:54:42,862
- All right, let's look under O.
- Under V.

801
00:54:45,544 --> 00:54:48,778
- V as in vindictive.
- What was that, Captain?

802
00:54:48,826 --> 00:54:50,818
I pity anybody who has you on his trail.

803
00:54:50,866 --> 00:54:54,016
You pity a man who's consorting
with a notorious Nazi?

804
00:54:54,064 --> 00:54:55,660
Von Resnicek, von Reudesheim...

805
00:54:55,708 --> 00:54:58,857
Did it occur to you there might be
extenuating circumstances?

806
00:54:58,905 --> 00:55:01,341
I expect any man in his country's uniform...

807
00:55:01,383 --> 00:55:04,821
Oh, that one.
You expect him to be an ambassador.

808
00:55:04,863 --> 00:55:08,463
A salesman of goodwill. You want him
to stand on the blackened rubble

809
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:10,701
of what used to be the corner of a street

810
00:55:10,749 --> 00:55:12,939
with a sample case of assorted freedoms,

811
00:55:12,987 --> 00:55:15,105
waving the flag and the Bill of Rights.

812
00:55:15,147 --> 00:55:17,457
That's not the way it works.

813
00:55:17,505 --> 00:55:21,105
Suppose you stop and ask yourself
how come he skidded of the road?

814
00:55:21,147 --> 00:55:25,269
- I'll tell you how. No moral brakes.
- That's it, going too fast.

815
00:55:25,311 --> 00:55:27,663
During the war, he couldn't go fast enough.

816
00:55:27,711 --> 00:55:32,259
"Get on that beachhead, through the
tank traps, across the Rhine. Step on it."

817
00:55:32,307 --> 00:55:37,665
Faster, 100 miles an hour,
24 hours a day through burning towns.

818
00:55:37,707 --> 00:55:39,507
Then one day the war is over.

819
00:55:39,549 --> 00:55:42,543
You expect him to jam on those brakes
and stop like that.

820
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:44,583
Everybody can't stop like that!

821
00:55:44,631 --> 00:55:48,747
Sometimes you skid, sometimes you go
into a spin and smash into a tree

822
00:55:48,789 --> 00:55:53,625
and bash your fenders and scrape those
fine ideals you brought from home.

823
00:55:53,673 --> 00:55:56,229
It's time such wrecks
were hauled into a garage.

824
00:55:56,271 --> 00:56:00,062
- Anyone who forgets he's American...
- Don't forget he's also human.

825
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:02,102
What would you know about that?

826
00:56:03,872 --> 00:56:05,306
Von Schlegel, von Schlittenheim...

827
00:56:05,474 --> 00:56:09,830
The loneliness is stored up right down
to his boots and it's driving him crazy.

828
00:56:09,872 --> 00:56:12,668
One day a pair of
open-toed shoes come along.

829
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:16,862
You want him to ask questions?
Party affiliation? Social Security number?

830
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:20,270
Yes, I want him to make sure
he's not doing something subversive.

831
00:56:20,312 --> 00:56:24,434
Are you qualified to call the pitch on this?
What's your life, anyway?

832
00:56:24,476 --> 00:56:27,116
Committees and sessions
and adjournments

833
00:56:27,152 --> 00:56:29,144
and budget cuts and appropriations.

834
00:56:29,192 --> 00:56:32,870
What do you do for laughs? What do you
do for tears for that matter?

835
00:56:34,916 --> 00:56:39,032
For tears... for tears I cry, Captain Pringle.

836
00:56:39,074 --> 00:56:41,228
It may interest you to know
I once cried for a man

837
00:56:41,276 --> 00:56:43,346
till my eyes were
half washed out of my head.

838
00:56:43,394 --> 00:56:45,464
Not really.

839
00:56:45,518 --> 00:56:50,114
I was on an important subcommittee.
One was a Southern Democrat.

840
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:52,988
His convictions
were utterly different from mine.

841
00:56:53,036 --> 00:56:57,157
I hated everything he stood for.
I despised his politics.

842
00:56:57,199 --> 00:56:59,917
But I loved him... insanely.

843
00:57:01,075 --> 00:57:03,715
I loved the Southern syrup in his voice.

844
00:57:04,519 --> 00:57:06,871
His mint julep manners.

845
00:57:06,919 --> 00:57:10,309
The way he'd look at me
through his long thick eyelashes

846
00:57:10,357 --> 00:57:12,553
when I was vetoing an amendment.

847
00:57:13,837 --> 00:57:18,307
He'd put his arm around me,
just kind of lazy, like.

848
00:57:19,681 --> 00:57:22,321
Lean his head against my cheek.

849
00:57:22,357 --> 00:57:25,747
His hair had a deep wave in it.

850
00:57:26,761 --> 00:57:30,277
- You know what he was trying to do?
- What?

851
00:57:31,279 --> 00:57:33,271
He was trying to sway my vote.

852
00:57:35,719 --> 00:57:38,869
Once he drove me home
from an all-night meeting,

853
00:57:38,923 --> 00:57:41,119
stopped his car on Earl Street.

854
00:57:41,161 --> 00:57:45,277
For no reason at all, he said,
except he was yearning for my lips.

855
00:57:46,681 --> 00:57:49,597
To tell you the truth, I was yearning for his.

856
00:57:50,965 --> 00:57:54,475
But it would have meant betraying
my platform and my constituents.

857
00:57:54,523 --> 00:57:56,719
- What did you do?
- I filibustered.

858
00:57:56,761 --> 00:57:59,118
- You what?
- I just kept on talking.

859
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:03,996
The constitution, the Bill of Rights, poems,
Longfellow, anything I could think of.

860
00:58:04,044 --> 00:58:08,160
Von Schloss, von Schlotzing,
von Schlumann, von Schlürmann,

861
00:58:08,202 --> 00:58:10,002
von...

862
00:58:12,804 --> 00:58:15,714
- No other man since the mint julep guy?
- No.

863
00:58:15,762 --> 00:58:18,324
- No more what you call yearning?
- No.

864
00:58:19,962 --> 00:58:22,524
- Sure?
- None of your business.

865
00:58:23,922 --> 00:58:28,476
I've been doing a little yearning
ever since you stepped off that plane.

866
00:58:29,448 --> 00:58:31,434
Captain Pringle!

867
00:58:32,844 --> 00:58:35,760
- Don't!
- Why not? You're not a Nazi.

868
00:58:35,808 --> 00:58:38,958
Don't tell me it's subversive
to kiss a Republican.

869
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:45,684
I am a Congresswoman.

870
00:58:45,726 --> 00:58:49,518
Yeah. Now I know how I'll cast
my absentee ballot come re-election.

871
00:58:49,566 --> 00:58:53,244
- I'm here on official business.
- This is official.

872
00:58:53,286 --> 00:58:55,962
Oh! Now, listen.

873
00:58:56,010 --> 00:58:57,840
Listen.

874
00:58:57,887 --> 00:59:02,009
"Listen, my children, and you shall hear
of the midnight ride of Paul Revere

875
00:59:02,051 --> 00:59:05,837
"On the 18th of April in '75,
hardly a man is now alive

876
00:59:05,891 --> 00:59:08,525
"Who remembers that famous day and year

877
00:59:09,287 --> 00:59:13,487
"He said to his friend, 'lf the British march
by land or sea from the town tonight

878
00:59:13,529 --> 00:59:18,365
"'Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch
of the North Church tower as a signal light

879
00:59:18,407 --> 00:59:20,765
"'One if by land and two if by sea

880
00:59:20,813 --> 00:59:24,803
"'And I on the opposite shore shall be
ready to ride and spread the alarm

881
00:59:24,851 --> 00:59:27,203
"'Through every Middlesex village and farm

882
00:59:27,251 --> 00:59:29,891
"'For the country folk to be up and to arm... '

883
00:59:31,451 --> 00:59:36,731
"Then he said 'Good night! '
and, with muffled oar, silent..." Oh!

884
00:59:36,773 --> 00:59:39,125
(Moans)

885
00:59:40,895 --> 00:59:43,805
Now, Congresswoman,
may I have the floor?

886
00:59:45,293 --> 00:59:47,285
You are entirely out of order.

887
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:49,325
Objection overruled.

888
01:00:11,092 --> 01:00:13,246
Ooh. Oh.

889
01:00:13,294 --> 01:00:15,652
Just, er, checking up on Paul Revere.

890
01:00:17,014 --> 01:00:20,086
Oh, sure.

891
01:01:19,341 --> 01:01:22,935
This is where you live, Congresswoman.
This is your billet.

892
01:01:24,699 --> 01:01:27,537
I said we're here. What's the matter?

893
01:01:29,301 --> 01:01:32,451
- I just want to die.
- You what?

894
01:01:32,505 --> 01:01:35,061
It's awful. It never should have happened.

895
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:38,013
Listen, you didn't burn down an orphanage.

896
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:40,455
You got kissed in a file room. That's all.

897
01:01:40,503 --> 01:01:42,699
- I'm a thief.
- Thief?

898
01:01:42,741 --> 01:01:45,861
The lowest kind of a thief,
stealing another woman's man.

899
01:01:46,665 --> 01:01:47,655
Yeah?

900
01:01:47,703 --> 01:01:50,061
The cake I brought. The girl you left behind.

901
01:01:50,103 --> 01:01:52,983
She sent a love letter and you fell in love
with the postman.

902
01:01:53,025 --> 01:01:56,619
Those things happen, like electrons,
positive and negative.

903
01:01:56,667 --> 01:01:59,816
- One day they get together and wham!
- No!

904
01:01:59,864 --> 01:02:01,502
No wham.

905
01:02:01,544 --> 01:02:04,580
- We've got to get control of ourselves.
- Can we?

906
01:02:04,628 --> 01:02:06,980
It would be wiser
not to see each other again.

907
01:02:07,028 --> 01:02:11,018
- I suppose it would.
- We can't go on with our investigation.

908
01:02:11,066 --> 01:02:14,216
- So we drop it.
- No. No, I'll go on alone.

909
01:02:15,224 --> 01:02:18,218
- I could enlist the help of the general.
- No.

910
01:02:18,266 --> 01:02:19,664
Why not?

911
01:02:19,706 --> 01:02:24,782
Miss Frost, Congresswoman,
Postman, darling,

912
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:28,616
to know that you're here and around
and I couldn't see you, I'd go crazy.

913
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:30,224
We've got to be strong.

914
01:02:30,266 --> 01:02:34,820
This business about Dusty, it's not serious.
It's just a college crush.

915
01:02:34,868 --> 01:02:38,018
- I have a dreadful sense of guilt.
- We're not engaged.

916
01:02:38,066 --> 01:02:40,706
I'm not committed in any way.

917
01:02:40,748 --> 01:02:45,698
It would break her heart, the daughter of
the man who swung the 4th Precinct.

918
01:02:45,752 --> 01:02:49,142
No, it won't.
She's a kind of a flighty kid, you know.

919
01:02:49,190 --> 01:02:52,022
She's been engaged to four guys
since I've been gone,

920
01:02:52,070 --> 01:02:54,428
one of them a feed and grain merchant.

921
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:57,068
Think what a good provider he'd make.

922
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:58,706
Oh, John...

923
01:02:59,474 --> 01:03:03,259
I don't even know your first name,
Congresswoman darling.

924
01:03:03,313 --> 01:03:05,299
- Phoebe.
- Phoebe.

925
01:03:05,353 --> 01:03:07,147
Isn't that ridiculous?

926
01:03:07,189 --> 01:03:09,181
Not a bit ridiculous.

927
01:03:11,113 --> 01:03:13,753
How about a good-night kiss, Phoebe?

928
01:03:15,793 --> 01:03:17,749
Good night.

929
01:03:21,595 --> 01:03:23,551
Good morning.

930
01:03:27,475 --> 01:03:29,671
Good evening.

931
01:03:34,153 --> 01:03:36,145
Good gracious.

932
01:03:43,873 --> 01:03:49,429
(Man) The problem is how to stop
all this physical human contact...

933
01:03:52,597 --> 01:03:56,305
We just ought to put our foot down
and put it down hard.

934
01:03:56,359 --> 01:03:58,549
- Why, Miss Frost.
- Where have you been?

935
01:03:58,597 --> 01:04:01,392
- We've been worried.
- Won't you join us?

936
01:04:01,434 --> 01:04:03,186
- Miss Frost?
- Miss Frost?

937
01:04:29,838 --> 01:04:31,830
Anything I can do for you?

938
01:04:32,838 --> 01:04:34,830
Not a thing.

939
01:04:37,278 --> 01:04:41,070
Hah... (Wails)

940
01:04:56,802 --> 01:05:01,637
- Hans Otto Birgel.
- That's the best we could find, Colonel.

941
01:05:01,679 --> 01:05:04,913
The others without uniform
don't show his face so plainly.

942
01:05:04,961 --> 01:05:08,753
Lovely master race type.
I bet he never tortured anybody.

943
01:05:08,801 --> 01:05:11,717
Not until he made sure
his dachshund had had his dinner.

944
01:05:11,765 --> 01:05:14,117
I want every MP to memorise this puss.

945
01:05:18,323 --> 01:05:22,115
Have 100 copies printed. Send it around
with a detailed description.

946
01:05:22,163 --> 01:05:23,357
Will do.

947
01:05:23,405 --> 01:05:26,045
We've got the trap baited
with the right cheese.

948
01:05:26,087 --> 01:05:28,277
He'll snap at it, sure as shooting.

949
01:05:29,363 --> 01:05:31,559
- I hope.
- (Knock at door)

950
01:05:31,607 --> 01:05:33,959
Come in.

951
01:05:34,007 --> 01:05:36,563
- You wanted to see me, Colonel?
- Yes, Miss Frost.

952
01:05:36,605 --> 01:05:38,801
- That'll be all, Major.
- Yes, sir.

953
01:05:39,845 --> 01:05:42,203
- How is the investigation going?
- The what?

954
01:05:42,245 --> 01:05:44,441
- The investigation.
- Oh, fine.

955
01:05:44,489 --> 01:05:47,285
- Making any progress?
- Slowly. Why?

956
01:05:48,089 --> 01:05:50,807
It seems, in the course of it,
you lost something.

957
01:05:50,849 --> 01:05:53,201
- I have?
- This is yours, isn't it?

958
01:05:54,245 --> 01:05:58,367
Yes, thank you very much.
Well, I guess I'd better get some hatpins.

959
01:05:58,409 --> 01:06:02,002
It is pretty windy in Berlin,
especially at night.

960
01:06:04,528 --> 01:06:07,678
Well, the whole thing
can be easily explained.

961
01:06:13,366 --> 01:06:18,202
But I hardly think you're in a position
to cast a stone, Colonel Plummer.

962
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:21,244
- I'm very sorry.
- I think you're brazen.

963
01:06:21,292 --> 01:06:22,438
Am I?

964
01:06:22,492 --> 01:06:26,038
- Having that on your desk.
- Having what on my desk?

965
01:06:26,092 --> 01:06:30,448
I know all about that going
100 miles an hour, then the war is over

966
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:32,686
but you can't stop like that.

967
01:06:32,728 --> 01:06:35,086
But there is such a thing as discretion.

968
01:06:35,890 --> 01:06:39,202
- What discretion?
- Is this your family?

969
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:42,052
Yes, and this is our house in Indiana.

970
01:06:42,094 --> 01:06:44,446
- How long have you been married?
- 22 years.

971
01:06:44,494 --> 01:06:47,884
Oh, no. Perhaps it would be a good idea
if you sent for your wife.

972
01:06:47,932 --> 01:06:50,290
She can't come now.
We're expecting a baby.

973
01:06:50,332 --> 01:06:53,164
- A baby?
- I mean, our older daughter is.

974
01:06:53,212 --> 01:06:57,766
I can understand the temptation of
a young man over here but a grandfather...

975
01:06:57,814 --> 01:07:01,599
Really, Colonel Plummer,
you should have your brakes relined.

976
01:07:22,377 --> 01:07:24,369
John. John, now I know.

977
01:07:24,417 --> 01:07:26,613
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

978
01:07:26,655 --> 01:07:29,013
- I found out. There can't be any doubt.
- What?

979
01:07:29,055 --> 01:07:30,855
- He even has her picture.
- Who?

980
01:07:30,897 --> 01:07:32,373
- Colonel Plummer.
- Whose?

981
01:07:32,415 --> 01:07:34,329
- That woman's.
- How come?

982
01:07:34,377 --> 01:07:36,369
I mean, what for?

983
01:07:36,417 --> 01:07:38,979
To look at. He can't keep his eyes off her.

984
01:07:39,015 --> 01:07:42,405
It must be a mistake.
Maybe it's somebody who looks like her.

985
01:07:42,459 --> 01:07:44,415
Should I talk it over with the general?

986
01:07:44,457 --> 01:07:47,337
- I wouldn't. Not the general.
- (Buzzer)

987
01:07:47,379 --> 01:07:51,495
Excuse me. Denazification office,
Captain Pringle speaking.

988
01:07:52,341 --> 01:07:55,491
- Who?
- Johnny, what has happened?

989
01:07:55,539 --> 01:07:58,689
Why didn't you come last night?
I waited for you.

990
01:07:58,737 --> 01:08:00,933
Johnny, are you listening?

991
01:08:00,981 --> 01:08:06,098
Of course I am, Lieutenant... Forrestal.

992
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:08,336
Lieutenant Forrestal, quartermasters.

993
01:08:08,378 --> 01:08:12,848
Well, Lieutenant, I'm sorry I couldn't
make it. I'm pretty busy these days.

994
01:08:12,902 --> 01:08:18,374
Johnny, what's the matter?
This is Erika. How you talk to me!

995
01:08:18,422 --> 01:08:22,382
Lieutenant, it should not be
too difficult to grasp the situation.

996
01:08:22,418 --> 01:08:24,776
I wonder how he got through officers school.

997
01:08:25,904 --> 01:08:27,890
Oh, someone is with you, is that it?

998
01:08:27,944 --> 01:08:30,134
That is correct, Lieutenant Forrestal.

999
01:08:30,182 --> 01:08:33,536
Is this the son of the secretary of the Navy?
Let me speak with him.

1000
01:08:33,584 --> 01:08:37,370
No, this is the army Forrestal,
absolutely no relation.

1001
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:41,972
Lieutenant, I assure you
I'll see you as soon as it's practical.

1002
01:08:42,026 --> 01:08:44,858
It may be late,
possibly after your office hours.

1003
01:08:45,704 --> 01:08:50,540
- I miss you so, Johnny. I love you.
- I'll make a note of that.

1004
01:08:50,582 --> 01:08:52,574
Goodbye, Lieutenant.

1005
01:08:52,622 --> 01:08:55,778
Nice kid. We went through
basic training together.

1006
01:08:57,344 --> 01:08:59,384
Now, what am I to do about the Colonel?

1007
01:08:59,426 --> 01:09:03,019
- I don't know.
- Could he be transferred to Japan?

1008
01:09:03,067 --> 01:09:06,853
I don't think so, not Japan.
Not with Tokyo Rose around.

1009
01:09:06,907 --> 01:09:09,865
- What do you suggest?
- What do I suggest?

1010
01:09:09,907 --> 01:09:12,703
- What do I suggest? Come on!
- Where are you taking me?

1011
01:09:12,745 --> 01:09:15,307
Brent, take over for me.
I won't be back today.

1012
01:09:15,343 --> 01:09:18,385
Where are you taking me?
We have a meeting with the general.

1013
01:09:18,427 --> 01:09:22,021
You don't want to see the general,
you want to see me. I want to see you.

1014
01:09:22,069 --> 01:09:25,219
So little time, so much to say.
Don't let's waste a minute.

1015
01:09:25,267 --> 01:09:28,063
- My investigation...
- I'll handle it after you go.

1016
01:09:28,105 --> 01:09:30,667
Send you a full report to Washington.

1017
01:09:30,709 --> 01:09:33,859
These few days are ours.
They're all we've got.

1018
01:09:33,907 --> 01:09:35,659
You dreadful man.

1019
01:09:35,707 --> 01:09:38,425
Come on. Let's get the Jeep
and drive out to Wannsee.

1020
01:09:38,467 --> 01:09:43,543
It's wide and green and I know a spot
that looks like a bend in the Mississippi.

1021
01:09:43,591 --> 01:09:45,181
Let's.

1022
01:09:49,669 --> 01:09:52,867
(Brakes screech, horn honks)

1023
01:10:02,269 --> 01:10:04,992
Johnny, come on.

1024
01:10:05,028 --> 01:10:07,668
- Faster. Faster.
- Hi.

1025
01:10:07,710 --> 01:10:12,264
Two days and two nights, what has
mein kleiner Liebling being doing?

1026
01:10:13,230 --> 01:10:16,032
He's been making charm
with the bloodhounds.

1027
01:10:16,074 --> 01:10:18,300
How are things going
with the Congresswoman?

1028
01:10:18,354 --> 01:10:21,228
- All right. We're engaged.
- You're what?

1029
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:23,628
Better than having my head chopped off.

1030
01:10:23,670 --> 01:10:27,552
- I didn't know you were that deep in.
- What deep? How deep?

1031
01:10:27,594 --> 01:10:30,348
Why didn't you tell me
you and Birgel were like that?

1032
01:10:30,396 --> 01:10:33,030
- He's dead.
- Having your hand kissed by Hitler.

1033
01:10:33,072 --> 01:10:34,872
I hope you had it sterilised.

1034
01:10:34,914 --> 01:10:37,554
Looked as if he had rat poison
in that moustache.

1035
01:10:37,596 --> 01:10:39,390
Don't talk like that.

1036
01:10:40,194 --> 01:10:43,788
Why not?
How much of a Nazi were you, anyway?

1037
01:10:43,836 --> 01:10:46,986
Johnny, what does it matter,
a woman's politics?

1038
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:51,156
Women pick out whatever's in fashion
and change it like a spring hat.

1039
01:10:51,198 --> 01:10:56,028
Yeah. Last year it was
a little number with a swastika on it.

1040
01:10:56,076 --> 01:10:59,862
This year it's ostrich feathers,
red, white and blue.

1041
01:10:59,916 --> 01:11:02,304
Next year a hammer, maybe, and a sickle.

1042
01:11:03,077 --> 01:11:07,115
Oh, Johnny, we must not say
mean words to each other.

1043
01:11:08,075 --> 01:11:12,197
When you say you are engaged,
that is only until her plane leaves, huh?

1044
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:14,225
What else?

1045
01:11:14,279 --> 01:11:16,631
- I love you so very much.
- You do?

1046
01:11:16,679 --> 01:11:19,397
You're the only man I ever wanted to marry.

1047
01:11:21,557 --> 01:11:23,549
That's mighty white of you.

1048
01:11:24,359 --> 01:11:28,991
I want to go with you to America.
I want to climb up the Statue of Liberty.

1049
01:11:29,039 --> 01:11:32,075
You want to get down
that basement at Fort Knox.

1050
01:11:32,117 --> 01:11:34,475
I want to be where you are.

1051
01:11:34,517 --> 01:11:38,639
Yeah, I can just imagine you
in Iowa in blue jeans,

1052
01:11:38,681 --> 01:11:40,877
going on a hay ride to the old mill.

1053
01:11:40,919 --> 01:11:42,911
I would love that.

1054
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:47,117
Mmm, gently, baby, it's Mother's Day.

1055
01:11:48,521 --> 01:11:50,873
Cut it out, you blonde flamethrower.

1056
01:11:51,761 --> 01:11:53,159
Cut it out, I said.

1057
01:11:57,641 --> 01:12:00,203
Did you ever kiss the Congresswoman?

1058
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:02,039
Sure I did.

1059
01:12:02,921 --> 01:12:06,310
- Did she kiss you?
- What kind of a question is that?

1060
01:12:06,364 --> 01:12:11,200
It's a very important question. What
do you do when you're alone together?

1061
01:12:11,242 --> 01:12:16,360
Oh... we sit, hold hands...

1062
01:12:17,764 --> 01:12:21,232
- whistle Shine On Harvest Moon.
- (Laughs)

1063
01:12:21,286 --> 01:12:23,842
- What's so funny?
- You hold hands?

1064
01:12:23,884 --> 01:12:25,918
Sure. Nice people do, you know.

1065
01:12:27,886 --> 01:12:30,874
You're so naive, you Americans.

1066
01:12:30,922 --> 01:12:33,118
So we are. So what of it?

1067
01:12:33,166 --> 01:12:38,002
That funny little woman with a face
like a scrubbed kitchen floor.

1068
01:12:38,044 --> 01:12:39,844
Yeah?

1069
01:12:43,564 --> 01:12:47,356
I have some vodka from the Russian sector
and I had the phonograph fixed.

1070
01:12:47,404 --> 01:12:50,128
- Would you like to hear some music?
- No thanks.

1071
01:12:50,164 --> 01:12:52,726
- Thanks a lot but no thanks.
- You're going?

1072
01:12:52,768 --> 01:12:56,758
- I got an early formation.
- You'll come back tomorrow night?

1073
01:12:56,806 --> 01:12:59,608
I imagine so, sterling character that I am.

1074
01:13:00,448 --> 01:13:02,242
So long.

1075
01:13:04,287 --> 01:13:08,199
([Music:] Pringle whistling
Shine On Harvest Moon)

1076
01:13:18,807 --> 01:13:21,405
- Miss Frost?
- Miss Frost?

1077
01:13:22,407 --> 01:13:25,563
- We're waiting for you.
- Dinner, Miss Frost.

1078
01:13:25,611 --> 01:13:28,167
- Did you call me?
- It's a quarter of eight.

1079
01:13:28,209 --> 01:13:30,771
We're going to the officers' mess for dinner.

1080
01:13:30,807 --> 01:13:33,531
I was sort of planning on a quiet evening.

1081
01:13:33,573 --> 01:13:35,325
Don't you feel well, Miss Frost?

1082
01:13:35,373 --> 01:13:38,523
I feel fine.
I have a kind of a headache, that's all.

1083
01:13:38,571 --> 01:13:40,767
Would you make
my excuses to the colonel?

1084
01:13:40,809 --> 01:13:43,611
- Sure will.
- Shall we bring you a sandwich maybe?

1085
01:13:43,653 --> 01:13:45,645
Cheese? Chicken? Ham?

1086
01:13:45,693 --> 01:13:49,569
Anything. Thank you very much.
Good evening, gentlemen.

1087
01:13:49,611 --> 01:13:51,567
Maybe we shouldn't leave her alone.

1088
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:55,653
Maybe we should take her temperature.
Quite a lot of typhoid fever in Berlin.

1089
01:13:59,415 --> 01:14:02,643
Oh, good evening. I came to see Miss Frost.

1090
01:14:02,691 --> 01:14:04,682
Go on in. We're going out.

1091
01:14:05,852 --> 01:14:08,732
One might suspect
Cupid had a hand in this.

1092
01:14:08,774 --> 01:14:12,560
If we didn't know Miss Frost.
You can't shoot an arrow through steel.

1093
01:14:13,736 --> 01:14:16,040
Phoebe... Phoebe!

1094
01:14:17,294 --> 01:14:20,684
([Music:] Whistling Shine On Harvest Moon)

1095
01:14:25,094 --> 01:14:27,050
Coming, John.

1096
01:14:47,336 --> 01:14:49,490
(Whistles appreciatively)

1097
01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:54,614
Well!

1098
01:14:57,140 --> 01:14:59,858
- Do I look all right?
- Where did you get it?

1099
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:03,494
- At the Brandenburg Gate.
- The black market? You didn't.

1100
01:15:03,542 --> 01:15:07,657
Well, I did. All I wanted was a lipstick
and something for my eyebrows

1101
01:15:07,699 --> 01:15:10,693
but a woman had this over
the handlebars of her bicycle

1102
01:15:10,741 --> 01:15:13,093
and I gave her my typewriter for it.

1103
01:15:13,141 --> 01:15:15,697
The shoes were six extra typewriter ribbons.

1104
01:15:15,739 --> 01:15:18,301
- Phoebe, for the love of Mike.
- Don't scold me.

1105
01:15:18,337 --> 01:15:20,695
I know I shouldn't have but I simply had to.

1106
01:15:20,743 --> 01:15:25,573
This is our last evening and I wanted
to look so pretty and I look just awful.

1107
01:15:25,621 --> 01:15:30,457
It's like a circus tent in mourning
for an elephant that died.

1108
01:15:30,499 --> 01:15:33,223
- It's no such thing.
- I'm not blind.

1109
01:15:33,259 --> 01:15:37,051
I tried to fix it but maybe
I'd better go up and put my suit on.

1110
01:15:37,903 --> 01:15:41,941
It is kind of high. What is it,
a turtleneck evening gown?

1111
01:15:41,983 --> 01:15:45,973
Well, it was a little lower but I fixed it.

1112
01:15:46,021 --> 01:15:47,977
You sure did.

1113
01:15:48,025 --> 01:15:52,141
Now, we takes this pin from here,
where it's just in the way,

1114
01:15:52,183 --> 01:15:55,141
and put it back here
where it can earn its pay.

1115
01:15:55,183 --> 01:15:57,175
It looked so lovely on the bicycle.

1116
01:15:57,223 --> 01:16:01,015
Now, stop it. You dressed for me
and to me you look good.

1117
01:16:01,063 --> 01:16:04,657
John, where did you learn
so much about women's clothes?

1118
01:16:04,705 --> 01:16:07,062
My mother wore women's clothes.

1119
01:16:07,104 --> 01:16:11,382
Oh, John, you're simply adorable.
Do you know it?

1120
01:16:11,424 --> 01:16:14,064
Who am I to argue with a Congresswoman?

1121
01:16:14,106 --> 01:16:16,302
You've got too much junk on your mouth.

1122
01:16:16,344 --> 01:16:18,336
- Have I?
- Now, hold still.

1123
01:16:20,628 --> 01:16:22,614
Now... we're in business.

1124
01:16:24,624 --> 01:16:26,538
We forgot your sable.

1125
01:16:26,586 --> 01:16:27,984
Oh...

1126
01:16:31,146 --> 01:16:34,062
You'll be quite a thing at that officers' mess.

1127
01:16:34,110 --> 01:16:37,098
- I don't want to go there.
- Where do you want to eat?

1128
01:16:37,146 --> 01:16:39,138
I thought some civilian place.

1129
01:16:39,186 --> 01:16:40,584
In Berlin?

1130
01:16:40,626 --> 01:16:44,418
The place where that singer...
You know, that place.

1131
01:16:44,466 --> 01:16:46,860
- You don't want to go to that sewer.
- Yes, I do.

1132
01:16:46,908 --> 01:16:49,470
I want it dark and gay and with music.

1133
01:16:50,268 --> 01:16:55,866
[Music:] Want to buy some illusions slightly used?

1134
01:16:55,908 --> 01:16:57,948
[Music:] Second-hand

1135
01:16:58,950 --> 01:17:04,344

01:17:11,909 --> 01:17:16,031
[Music:] A spell you can't explain

1139
01:17:16,991 --> 01:17:21,107
[Music:] For in this crazy paradise

1140
01:17:21,149 --> 01:17:25,271
[Music:] You are in love with pain

1141

[Music:] Want to buy some illusions slightly used?

1142
01:17:32,633 --> 01:17:34,667
[Music:] Just like new

1143
01:17:36,473 --> 01:17:40,259
[Music:] Such romantic illusions

1144
01:17:40,313 --> 01:17:44,429
[Music:] And they're all about you

1145
01:17:45,797 --> 01:17:50,267
[Music:] I'd sell them all for a penny

1146
01:17:50,315 --> 01:17:54,431
[Music:] They make pretty souvenirs

1147
01:17:55,877 --> 01:17:59,663
[Music:] Take my lovely illusions

1148
01:17:59,717 --> 01:18:02,069
[Music:] Some for laughs

[Music:] Some for tears [Music:]

1150
01:18:14,794 --> 01:18:18,184
- Look, it's a hollow bottle.
- That's where the profit is.

1151
01:18:18,238 --> 01:18:20,794
There should be
a Congressional investigation.

1152
01:18:20,836 --> 01:18:24,226
- Second the motion.
- Let's investigate another bottle first.

1153
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:26,188
- More champagne.
- Jawohl.

1154
01:18:26,998 --> 01:18:28,954
Hold my hand, John.

1155
01:18:30,196 --> 01:18:31,996
Sure.

1156
01:18:32,998 --> 01:18:35,272
Oh, John...

1157
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:37,276
I'm so happy, I'm in heaven.

1158
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:40,558
Not that I was unhappy before.

1159
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:42,478
I was just drifting.

1160
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:46,396
That's it. Drifting on a grey sea all alone.

1161
01:18:46,438 --> 01:18:48,796
It's not bad but suddenly you get scared.

1162
01:18:48,838 --> 01:18:53,470
You need another voice,
so you hoist up your heart and you wait

1163
01:18:53,518 --> 01:18:56,674
and nobody passes by, just grey waves.

1164
01:18:56,722 --> 01:19:01,114
Your heart gets frayed,
lashed by the night winds and rain.

1165
01:19:01,162 --> 01:19:05,632
So you haul it down, what's left of it,
and you resign yourself...

1166
01:19:06,603 --> 01:19:10,197
Then suddenly out of nowhere
comes a boat so unexpected,

1167
01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:12,879
all white sails on the horizon.

1168
01:19:12,921 --> 01:19:15,279
To you, my beautiful boat.

1169
01:19:16,725 --> 01:19:18,915
Phoebe, you make me feel awful.

1170
01:19:18,963 --> 01:19:22,839
Well, you are beautiful and you're fun
and you're good to me.

1171
01:19:22,881 --> 01:19:26,241
Stop it. I'm not that good.
Some day you may find...

1172
01:19:26,283 --> 01:19:28,317
You talk an awful lot for a boat.

1173
01:19:29,763 --> 01:19:31,563
To us.

1174
01:19:35,763 --> 01:19:37,755

01:20:24,086 --> 01:20:26,078
(Cheering and applause)

1185
01:20:29,132 --> 01:20:31,118
- Good evening.
- May I?

1186
01:20:32,408 --> 01:20:35,126
- Get another glass, John.
- No thank you.

1187
01:20:37,208 --> 01:20:39,404
My, look at the kitchen floor.

1188
01:20:40,808 --> 01:20:43,724
- Look at what?
- Such a change.

1189
01:20:43,772 --> 01:20:47,240
This dress. This dress is from Iowa?

1190
01:20:47,294 --> 01:20:49,568
Oh, no, Berlin. Do you like it?

1191
01:20:50,252 --> 01:20:54,368
It's stunning but haven't you
got it on backwards? And the hair.

1192
01:20:55,370 --> 01:20:57,932
What did you put in
those pigtails, shoelaces?

1193
01:20:57,974 --> 01:21:00,770
- I like it.
- He likes it.

1194
01:21:00,812 --> 01:21:05,048
I shouldn't have mentioned the eyebrows.
Now her face looks bow-legged.

1195
01:21:05,096 --> 01:21:08,689
Miss von Schlütow, I think
the pianist is looking for you.

1196
01:21:08,731 --> 01:21:11,881
Have you ever made any progress
hunting down that man?

1197
01:21:11,935 --> 01:21:13,927
- What man?
- My man.

1198
01:21:13,975 --> 01:21:15,613
Oh.

1199
01:21:15,655 --> 01:21:20,683
Oh, a little progress, only that's all been
postponed on account of another man.

1200
01:21:20,731 --> 01:21:23,611
Look at him. Isn't he beautiful?

1201
01:21:23,653 --> 01:21:26,485
Phoebe, please.
She always kids me like that.

1202
01:21:26,533 --> 01:21:31,129
- I know he's not pretty but he's beautiful.
- When are you leaving Berlin?

1203
01:21:31,177 --> 01:21:34,087
- Tomorrow. It's our last night together.
- Too bad.

1204
01:21:34,135 --> 01:21:36,775
What he doesn't know is he's going too.

1205
01:21:36,817 --> 01:21:39,169
- I am?
- I talked it over with the general.

1206
01:21:39,217 --> 01:21:41,935
- It was to be a surprise.
- It is.

1207
01:21:41,977 --> 01:21:43,969
- I can't go.
- Yes, you can.

1208
01:21:44,017 --> 01:21:46,579
He hasn't had a furlough in four years.

1209
01:21:47,455 --> 01:21:51,931
This is a bolt from the blue.
I didn't have the slightest, faintest...

1210
01:21:51,979 --> 01:21:55,129
Miss von Schlütow,
isn't it time for your next number?

1211
01:21:55,177 --> 01:21:57,817
There'll be no next number tonight.

1212
01:21:57,859 --> 01:22:00,577
May I steal
one of your American cigarettes?

1213
01:22:16,098 --> 01:22:19,092
Hey, Pringle.
John, the Colonel's looking for you.

1214
01:22:19,902 --> 01:22:21,696
- Colonel?
- Yelling his head off.

1215
01:22:21,738 --> 01:22:24,300
He's got enough blood
in his eye to sell by the pint.

1216
01:22:24,342 --> 01:22:27,774
- What does he want?
- I don't know. Get down to his office.

1217
01:22:29,418 --> 01:22:31,458
Check! Check! Er... (Speaks German)

1218
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:33,858
Go on. I'll take care of the check. Hurry.

1219
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:37,896
- I'll drop you on the way.
- I'll take Miss Frost home. Get going.

1220
01:22:37,944 --> 01:22:40,296
Why are you going? It's so nice here.

1221
01:22:40,344 --> 01:22:43,254
- I got to go. Didn't you hear?
- I forbid you.

1222
01:22:43,302 --> 01:22:45,942
- Phoebe, this is the army.
- I don't want you to go.

1223
01:22:45,984 --> 01:22:47,538
I got to go.

1224
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:50,736
All right. You're in contempt of Congress.

1225
01:22:51,744 --> 01:22:54,096
Take care of our friend. Goodbye.

1226
01:22:54,144 --> 01:22:56,136
Goodbye, Fräulein von Schlütow.

1227
01:22:58,584 --> 01:23:01,146
- How much?
- No, this is on the house.

1228
01:23:01,182 --> 01:23:04,782
- Thank you. Ready, Miss Frost?
- Sit down. Have some champagne.

1229
01:23:04,824 --> 01:23:07,734
Another bottle. (Speaking German)

1230
01:23:07,782 --> 01:23:09,737
Sit down.

1231
01:23:12,503 --> 01:23:16,625
No, I really shouldn't be in a place like this.

1232
01:23:16,667 --> 01:23:18,065
(Hiccups)

1233
01:23:18,107 --> 01:23:20,297
(All yelling "Hey" in time
with Russian Cossack music)

1234
01:23:47,465 --> 01:23:49,859
- Ha!
- (All cheer)

1235
01:23:57,347 --> 01:24:00,947
[Music:] The stars at night are big and bright

1236
01:24:01,751 --> 01:24:03,743
[Music:] Deep in the heart of Texas

1237
01:24:04,589 --> 01:24:07,583
[Music:] The prairie sky is wide and high

1238
01:24:08,273 --> 01:24:11,182
- [Music:] Deep in the heart of Texas
- (Man) Yahoo!

1239
01:24:11,230 --> 01:24:14,584
[Music:] The sage in bloom is like perfume

1240
01:24:14,632 --> 01:24:17,350
[Music:] Deep in the heart of Texas

1241
01:24:17,392 --> 01:24:20,782
[Music:] Reminds me of the one I love

1242
01:24:20,830 --> 01:24:23,188
[Music:] Deep in the heart of Texas [Music:]

1243
01:24:23,230 --> 01:24:25,222
(All cheering)

1244
01:24:26,074 --> 01:24:28,264
Don't suppose you boys
know the Iowa song?

1245
01:24:28,312 --> 01:24:31,222
- Iowa, where's that?
- In the United States, silly.

1246
01:24:31,270 --> 01:24:33,466
- Since when?
- 1846.

1247
01:24:33,514 --> 01:24:36,868
No kidding. (Hums)

1248
01:24:36,910 --> 01:24:39,106
(Frost hums, off-key)

1249
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:45,832
- Would you like to play it?
- We'll play it but we don't like it.

1250
01:24:47,596 --> 01:24:49,948
- My old campaign song.
- Sing it.

1251
01:24:49,996 --> 01:24:51,988
- No.
- You must. You asked for it.

1252
01:24:52,036 --> 01:24:55,426
Maybe there's some boats around.
Who knows? Go on.

1253
01:24:56,314 --> 01:25:00,196
[Music:] Ioway, Ioway

1254
01:25:00,238 --> 01:25:03,628
[Music:] State of all the land, joy on every hand

1255
01:25:03,676 --> 01:25:08,146
[Music:] We are from Ioway, Ioway

1256
01:25:08,194 --> 01:25:11,583
[Music:] That's where the tall corn grows

1257
01:25:12,717 --> 01:25:16,311
[Music:] Fly away, Ioway

1258
01:25:16,353 --> 01:25:19,749
[Music:] State of all the land, joy on every hand

1259
01:25:19,797 --> 01:25:23,187
- [Music:] We are from Ioway... [Music:]
- (Speaking German)

1260
01:25:36,159 --> 01:25:40,389
[Music:] We are from Ioway, Ioway

1261
01:25:40,437 --> 01:25:43,077
[Music:] That's where the tall corn grows [Music:]

1262
01:25:43,119 --> 01:25:45,477
- Everybody, sing!
- (Cheering)

1263
01:25:45,519 --> 01:25:50,229
[Music:] We are from Ioway, Ioway

1264
01:25:50,277 --> 01:25:53,475
[Music:] State of all the land, joy on every hand

1265
01:25:53,517 --> 01:25:57,639
[Music:] We are from Ioway, Ioway

1266
01:25:57,681 --> 01:26:01,275
[Music:] That's where the tall corn grows [Music:]

1267
01:26:03,999 --> 01:26:06,723
(Yelling in Russian)

1268
01:26:16,922 --> 01:26:19,358
(Sirens outside)

1269
01:26:20,324 --> 01:26:24,440
This is a raid. All military personnel,
get out their papers.

1270
01:26:25,484 --> 01:26:28,442
(Official speaking German)

1271
01:26:29,762 --> 01:26:31,754
(Frost) Whoo-hoo!

1272
01:26:33,602 --> 01:26:36,164
Hey. Hey, you.

1273
01:26:37,166 --> 01:26:38,960
Who-hoo.

1274
01:26:39,002 --> 01:26:41,120
- Hey.
- (Speaking German)

1275
01:26:43,442 --> 01:26:44,960
Jawohl!

1276
01:26:45,002 --> 01:26:46,280
(Laughs)

1277
01:26:46,322 --> 01:26:48,680
- Oh, will you...
- (Speaking German)

1278
01:26:48,722 --> 01:26:50,798
Where are we going?

1279
01:26:51,848 --> 01:26:53,834
Pretty hat. Let me try it on.

1280
01:27:13,927 --> 01:27:17,317
What's this? What's happening?
Where are we going?

1281
01:27:18,247 --> 01:27:21,241
- To the police station. This is a raid.
- A what?

1282
01:27:21,289 --> 01:27:24,883
- A raid. We have one every other week.
- That's ridiculous.

1283
01:27:24,925 --> 01:27:26,725
They want to check up on our papers.

1284
01:27:26,767 --> 01:27:29,329
We Germans have to have
our papers in order.

1285
01:27:29,371 --> 01:27:31,723
But I'm not a German. They have no right...

1286
01:27:31,771 --> 01:27:35,887
Of course they haven't. There's
no reason why you should submit to it.

1287
01:27:35,929 --> 01:27:40,483
You just tell them who you are and
they'll apologise and let you go home.

1288
01:27:40,531 --> 01:27:43,681
Only on second thoughts, is it a good idea?

1289
01:27:43,729 --> 01:27:47,119
What kind of an impression
will it make on us Germans?

1290
01:27:47,173 --> 01:27:52,003
A Congresswoman of the United States
of America caught at the Lorelei.

1291
01:27:52,891 --> 01:27:56,245
And where did the Honourable
Miss Frost get that dress?

1292
01:27:56,293 --> 01:27:58,489
The black market, maybe?

1293
01:28:22,332 --> 01:28:25,326
- Want some coffee, Captain?
- No thanks, sir.

1294
01:28:25,374 --> 01:28:28,284
- Just as well. This is the only cup.
- Yes, sir.

1295
01:28:28,332 --> 01:28:31,326
How about a jigger of poison
with a hemlock chaser?

1296
01:28:31,374 --> 01:28:33,174
More like it, sir.

1297
01:28:34,134 --> 01:28:39,210
Captain, I think you have as good
a war record as any man in this town.

1298
01:28:39,258 --> 01:28:43,374
You were on the first team since Normandy
and you sure carried the ball.

1299
01:28:43,416 --> 01:28:48,252
I know you were among the first ten men
to cross the Remagen Bridge.

1300
01:28:48,294 --> 01:28:50,934
I also know why you were in such a hurry.

1301
01:28:52,056 --> 01:28:55,050
Did you know what a hot potato
you had on your hands?

1302
01:28:55,098 --> 01:29:00,216
Well, not quite, sir.
I... had a hunch it was warm, all right.

1303
01:29:00,258 --> 01:29:02,820
Sometimes I wonder
if it isn't a waste of money

1304
01:29:02,856 --> 01:29:06,978
to import 11,000 ping-pong tables
for the recreation of you young men.

1305
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:10,608
Captain, you might as well realise

1306
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:13,727
we've been wise to you
and the von Schlütow woman all along.

1307
01:29:13,775 --> 01:29:15,689
I kind of figured you were peeking.

1308
01:29:15,737 --> 01:29:19,331
The army has been counting on you
for a certain pattern of behaviour.

1309
01:29:19,379 --> 01:29:22,019
- You let us down but good.
- Sorry, sir.

1310
01:29:23,021 --> 01:29:26,411
Since that committee arrived,
you've been playing a double bill

1311
01:29:26,459 --> 01:29:28,577
with the lady from Iowa in the upper half.

1312
01:29:28,619 --> 01:29:31,529
I'd appreciate it
if you leave her out of this, sir.

1313
01:29:32,543 --> 01:29:34,337
You would?

1314
01:29:35,423 --> 01:29:39,971
Pressure has been exerted to have you
go back to the United States for a while.

1315
01:29:40,019 --> 01:29:42,659
- So I've heard.
- You're not going of course.

1316
01:29:42,701 --> 01:29:46,091
Of course. When do proceedings start, sir?

1317
01:29:47,099 --> 01:29:51,731
Captain Pringle, you're to stay away
from that certain party, off limits.

1318
01:29:51,785 --> 01:29:55,379
Suits me fine. It was all washed up
anyway as far as I'm concerned.

1319
01:29:55,421 --> 01:30:00,131
Let's get this straight. You're to stay
away from the Congresswoman.

1320
01:30:00,185 --> 01:30:01,823
Oh?

1321
01:30:01,865 --> 01:30:04,253
Pick up that torch for
Fräulein von Schlütow,

1322
01:30:04,301 --> 01:30:07,217
light it again and carry it in public,
that's an order.

1323
01:30:08,141 --> 01:30:11,297
- Well, how do you do.
- You've heard of Hans Otto Birgel?

1324
01:30:11,344 --> 01:30:14,656
- That was her guy.
- He's hiding out in the American zone.

1325
01:30:14,704 --> 01:30:16,900
- He's dead.
- He's very much alive.

1326
01:30:16,942 --> 01:30:18,898
And thanks to you, he's kicking.

1327
01:30:18,946 --> 01:30:22,096
We had a hunch about him
so we watched Miss von Schlütow.

1328
01:30:22,144 --> 01:30:24,178
Here are three letters we intercepted.

1329
01:30:24,226 --> 01:30:28,858
Someone tipped him off that his girl
has been seeing an American officer.

1330
01:30:28,906 --> 01:30:32,452
He's a jealous rat. He says he's going
to come out and kill you both.

1331
01:30:33,466 --> 01:30:37,060
- That's cute.
- Now, go on back and fan those flames.

1332
01:30:37,108 --> 01:30:39,940
Stick around the Fräulein until he shows.

1333
01:30:39,988 --> 01:30:42,544
I wish I'd never crossed
the Remagen Bridge.

1334
01:30:42,586 --> 01:30:44,974
Sorry, son, that's the way it reads.

1335
01:30:45,028 --> 01:30:49,018
OK, I'm going.
Only I think I'll have that coffee first.

1336
01:30:49,066 --> 01:30:52,660
Never mind the cup.
Just give me a spoonful of the powder.

1337
01:30:54,310 --> 01:30:56,620
(Speaking German)

1338
01:31:14,667 --> 01:31:17,661
- Do you have your passport with you?
- No.

1339
01:31:17,709 --> 01:31:21,705
You just tell them who you are
and they check with the army officials.

1340
01:31:21,753 --> 01:31:24,309
- I can't do that.
- Why?

1341
01:31:24,351 --> 01:31:28,821
What if the German papers pick it up
and there are some ugly references?

1342
01:31:28,869 --> 01:31:30,861
May never reach Washington.

1343
01:31:31,953 --> 01:31:36,501
Of course there's one person who could
get you out of all this nastiness.

1344
01:31:36,549 --> 01:31:38,745
Me. I could do it.

1345
01:31:39,633 --> 01:31:42,465
No names mentioned. No aftereffects.

1346
01:31:42,513 --> 01:31:44,505
Just as if it never happened.

1347
01:31:45,633 --> 01:31:48,195
Why should you? You don't like me.

1348
01:31:48,231 --> 01:31:52,023
It's not generosity. We Germans
can't afford to be generous.

1349
01:31:52,071 --> 01:31:54,063
We're very poor.

1350
01:31:54,111 --> 01:31:56,673
It's give and take if we are to survive.

1351
01:31:57,633 --> 01:31:59,991
What have I to give?

1352
01:32:00,033 --> 01:32:03,789
- What do you want to take?
- (Officer yelling in German)

1353
01:32:08,355 --> 01:32:10,665
(Speaking German)

1354
01:32:36,596 --> 01:32:39,194
(Speaking German)

1355
01:33:05,642 --> 01:33:09,758
You know what I told him?
That you were a country cousin of mine.

1356
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:12,158
Perfectly easy if you have a safe conduct

1357
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:15,349
with the signature of
a kind American officer on it.

1358
01:33:15,403 --> 01:33:17,755
And you wanted to chop his head off.

1359
01:33:17,803 --> 01:33:21,031
Exactly what is it you want from me,
Fräulein von Schlütow?

1360
01:33:21,079 --> 01:33:24,469
Let's go up to my apartment.
It's only a few ruins away from here.

1361
01:33:24,523 --> 01:33:27,079
- No, I'd rather not.
- You'd better.

1362
01:33:27,121 --> 01:33:29,113
You may need a handkerchief.

1363
01:33:32,965 --> 01:33:37,081
This is a beastly thing to do but you must
understand what happened to us here.

1364
01:33:37,123 --> 01:33:40,273
We all become animals
with exactly one instinct left.

1365
01:33:40,321 --> 01:33:42,121
Self-preservation.

1366
01:33:42,163 --> 01:33:45,313
Take me, Miss Frost.
Bombed out a dozen times.

1367
01:33:45,361 --> 01:33:48,001
Everything caved in
and pulled out from under me.

1368
01:33:48,043 --> 01:33:50,959
My country, my possessions, my beliefs.

1369
01:33:51,007 --> 01:33:52,993
Yet somehow I kept going.

1370
01:33:53,047 --> 01:33:57,277
Months in air-raid shelters
crammed in with 5,000 other people.

1371
01:33:57,325 --> 01:33:59,125
I kept going.

1372
01:33:59,167 --> 01:34:03,637
What do you think it was like to be a woman
here when the Russians swept in?

1373
01:34:03,685 --> 01:34:05,881
I kept going.

1374
01:34:05,929 --> 01:34:08,917
It was a living hell... and then I found a man.

1375
01:34:08,965 --> 01:34:12,355
And through that man,
a roof and a job and food and...

1376
01:34:13,644 --> 01:34:15,840
And I'm not going to lose him.

1377
01:34:15,888 --> 01:34:17,880
What has all this to do with me?

1378
01:34:17,928 --> 01:34:21,078
A little. You see, you want the same man.

1379
01:34:22,728 --> 01:34:26,514
Come on. I told you
you'd need a handkerchief.

1380
01:34:29,370 --> 01:34:31,722
([Music:] Whistling Shine On Harvest Moon)

1381
01:34:52,812 --> 01:34:56,040
This is how he looked when I met him first.
He was a lieutenant.

1382
01:34:56,088 --> 01:34:58,650
He sat at his desk interrogating me.

1383
01:34:58,692 --> 01:35:01,842
He had such a grim, businesslike face,

1384
01:35:01,890 --> 01:35:06,012
but fortunately I was wearing
my last pair of silk stockings.

1385
01:35:06,972 --> 01:35:09,168
He's really a nice boy.

1386
01:35:09,210 --> 01:35:11,772
You mustn't judge him
by what he did to you.

1387
01:35:12,534 --> 01:35:14,327
He hated it. I know.

1388
01:35:14,369 --> 01:35:18,845
Of course, he would come here
and feel so miserable and sorry for you.

1389
01:35:18,893 --> 01:35:21,689
Your plane is leaving tomorrow, isn't it?

1390
01:35:24,173 --> 01:35:29,009
Don't sit there as if it was the end
of the world. Nothing happened.

1391
01:35:29,051 --> 01:35:31,691
He played a dirty trick on you, that's all.

1392
01:35:32,531 --> 01:35:36,653
So you fly off back home,
wash your hands, wash your lips...

1393
01:35:37,655 --> 01:35:40,649
They've got so much soap
in the United States.

1394
01:35:42,215 --> 01:35:45,047
Sorry. You know this game of love.

1395
01:35:45,095 --> 01:35:47,813
If you want to take
the advice of an old gambler,

1396
01:35:47,855 --> 01:35:51,089
some people are lucky at it,
some people are jinxed.

1397
01:35:51,935 --> 01:35:54,653
They shouldn't even sit down at the table.

1398
01:35:55,619 --> 01:35:57,653
(Car horn honks)

1399
01:36:01,937 --> 01:36:04,133
I do not imagine you care to see him again.

1400
01:36:04,175 --> 01:36:08,171
Why not go up the stairs where it's dark
until he comes in and then leave?

1401
01:36:08,897 --> 01:36:11,651
(Car horn honks)

1402
01:36:11,699 --> 01:36:14,260
Go on, leave. Haven't you had enough?

1403
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:19,972
What is this, a big scene?

1404
01:36:20,020 --> 01:36:23,614
We can't keep a gentleman
in the dark, can we?

1405
01:36:23,656 --> 01:36:26,812
Four hours ago you could
have had him court-martialled

1406
01:36:26,860 --> 01:36:29,770
and sent me to a labour camp, not now.

1407
01:36:29,818 --> 01:36:32,734
Not any more. Now you're one of us.

1408
01:36:44,458 --> 01:36:46,258
Hi.

1409
01:36:53,662 --> 01:36:56,812
What's the matter?
No kiss for your little Schweinehund?

1410
01:36:58,504 --> 01:37:02,416
I'm sorry I had to show up with that
Congress dame. She's gone dappy.

1411
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:05,854
Doesn't mean a thing.
Leaving tomorrow anyway.

1412
01:37:05,902 --> 01:37:07,702
Come on.

1413
01:37:30,867 --> 01:37:32,661
Sorry.

1414
01:37:35,343 --> 01:37:39,465
I guess this is where the funny man says,
"Shall we dance?"

1415
01:37:39,507 --> 01:37:42,069
You are not a funny man, Captain Pringle.

1416
01:37:42,987 --> 01:37:45,339
But you are quite a dancer.

1417
01:37:45,387 --> 01:37:47,379
What a waltz we had.

1418
01:37:48,345 --> 01:37:50,145
Good night.

1419

1424
01:38:38,912 --> 01:38:40,904
Holy mackerel!

1425
01:39:31,717 --> 01:39:35,107
The last time we had
one of these, it lasted 11 days.

1426
01:39:35,155 --> 01:39:36,751
You're a great comfort.

1427
01:39:36,799 --> 01:39:41,635
You can't get to Washington soon enough,
can you, to dash off that black Berlin report?

1428
01:39:41,677 --> 01:39:44,035
No report at all, Colonel Plummer.

1429
01:39:44,077 --> 01:39:47,863
- No?
- I came here as an objective observer.

1430
01:39:47,917 --> 01:39:51,511
Some things have happened
which automatically disqualify me.

1431
01:39:51,559 --> 01:39:53,551
Aren't you taking it a little big?

1432
01:39:53,599 --> 01:39:56,827
- You know nothing whatever about it.
- I got a hunch.

1433
01:39:56,881 --> 01:40:00,667
In a way, I'm glad you took off the blinkers
and wandered away on your own.

1434
01:40:00,721 --> 01:40:04,315
It's a big mess we're trying to clean up.
There's a lot of rubble.

1435
01:40:04,357 --> 01:40:08,239
Rubble of all kinds,
vegetable, mineral and animal.

1436
01:40:08,281 --> 01:40:12,157
You walk around on it, you're apt to get
conked on the head by a loose brick.

1437
01:40:12,199 --> 01:40:14,761
Stop it, please.
I've had about all I can stand.

1438
01:40:14,803 --> 01:40:19,554
(Plummer) I'm sorry but I feel a little
responsible about that loose brick, Pringle.

1439
01:40:19,602 --> 01:40:22,752
- Colonel, please.
- I'm not trying to whitewash him.

1440
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:25,158
There isn't enough paint in Germany for that

1441
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:28,032
but let me scrape together
something in his defence.

1442
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:30,438
- I'm not listening.
- Take it from me.

1443
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:32,472
He won't get off scot-free.

1444
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:35,436
As a matter of fact,
he's started to pay already.

1445
01:40:35,484 --> 01:40:39,474
It's no fun to walk around
with a target pinned on your chest.

1446
01:40:42,282 --> 01:40:45,084
I'd appreciate it if you'd leave me alone.

1447
01:40:46,884 --> 01:40:49,524
How's about some reading matter
for the plane?

1448
01:40:50,526 --> 01:40:54,996
Those aren't teardrops. I was washing my
hands when he asked me to give it to you.

1449
01:40:56,886 --> 01:40:59,238
All right, I'll put it right there.

1450
01:41:09,924 --> 01:41:14,046
Colonel Plummer, it's clearing. We should
be taking off in about 20 minutes.

1451
01:41:14,088 --> 01:41:16,079
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

1452

Gentlemen, I was just informed there will
be no flights until tomorrow morning.

get ourselves back into town.

to wait for the fog to lift a little.

Hans Otto Birgel.

Big Gestapo man hiding out underground.

1488
01:45:24,151 --> 01:45:28,267
The only lead we have is that
he's still crazy about a former lady friend,

1489
01:45:28,309 --> 01:45:31,189
a nightclub singer
somewhere in the American sector.

1490
01:45:32,389 --> 01:45:35,983
Herr Birgel suspects she's two-timing him
so he crawls out of his hole.

1491
01:45:36,031 --> 01:45:38,149
Only he doesn't crawl fast enough.

1492
01:45:38,191 --> 01:45:41,341
So we play it up a little
with the help of an American officer.

- The Love Commando.
- (Woman) Ha.

1496
01:45:50,029 --> 01:45:53,821
Here's their angle. The Captain
isn't very keen for the assignment,

1497
01:45:53,875 --> 01:45:57,025
having fallen for
somebody else in the meantime.

1498

You know how they cook it up
with a lot of marshmallow on top.

Then the story of how
they got the poison into Göring's cell.

- Trouble at the Lorelei.

- Birgel showed up. There was shooting.
- (Plummer) Who got it?

1504
01:46:17,677 --> 01:46:20,586
- I don't know, sir.
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

to come along, Miss Frost.

01:46:27,636 --> 01:46:30,468
([Music:] Singing drunkenly in Russian)

1508
01:47:16,518 --> 01:47:20,117
Mm-hm. Two plugs right through the kisser.

1509
01:47:20,921 --> 01:47:21,989
No.

1510
01:47:23,759 --> 01:47:27,149
- It was an ugly kisser anyway.
- It was not.

1511
01:47:27,203 --> 01:47:30,191
He was no good
and he's dead and it's OK by me.

1512
01:47:30,239 --> 01:47:31,721
Ohh...

1513
01:47:31,763 --> 01:47:33,719
No sense of humour.

1514
01:47:33,761 --> 01:47:35,753
Take care of her, lover boy.

1515
01:47:41,003 --> 01:47:42,995
(Humming mournfully)

1516
01:47:44,201 --> 01:47:46,397
- All right, clean up the mess.
- Yes, sir.

1517
01:47:46,445 --> 01:47:50,915
Find him a slab before the Russkies
start tossing him up to the ceiling.

1518
01:47:54,923 --> 01:47:56,723
Go on home!

1519
01:47:56,765 --> 01:47:59,405
Come on, break it up, let's go. All right.

1520
01:47:59,447 --> 01:48:01,433
(Humming stops)

1521
01:48:03,005 --> 01:48:04,595
Where are you taking me?

1522
01:48:04,643 --> 01:48:08,435
Looks like you've got a date
with five million von bricks.

1523
01:48:08,483 --> 01:48:10,601
I have a paper saying I'm on the white list.

1524
01:48:10,643 --> 01:48:12,635
We know how you got it and it wasn't,

1525
01:48:12,683 --> 01:48:15,599
if you'll pardon
the non-Aryan expression, kosher.

1526
01:48:15,647 --> 01:48:17,765
You do not understand. There's a mix-up.

1527
01:48:17,807 --> 01:48:20,716
Yeah. We just sent part of it
off to the morgue.

1528
01:48:20,764 --> 01:48:23,722
- Just ask Captain Pringle.
- Forget Captain Pringle.

1529
01:48:23,764 --> 01:48:28,240
How could I ever forget him?
He's so nice. I will miss him terribly.

1530
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:30,280
- Please tell him.
- No soap.

1531
01:48:30,328 --> 01:48:32,758
And no chocolate, no cigarettes.

1532
01:48:32,806 --> 01:48:34,762
Tough.

1533
01:48:35,848 --> 01:48:40,240
Tell me, Colonel, are you
that wonderful Colonel Plummer?

1534
01:48:40,288 --> 01:48:44,602
That's me,
only most of the time they call me delicious.

1535
01:48:44,650 --> 01:48:48,724
Colonel, if I could come to your office
tomorrow sometime,

1536
01:48:48,766 --> 01:48:50,644
when you're not too busy.

1537
01:48:50,686 --> 01:48:54,478
Miss von Schlütow,
I've become a grandfather today.

1538
01:48:54,532 --> 01:48:56,284
Let's not be silly.

1539
01:48:57,052 --> 01:48:59,038
She's all yours.

1540
01:48:59,092 --> 01:49:01,732
Can they take me
by my apartment so I can change?

1541
01:49:01,768 --> 01:49:05,206
- I guess so.
- Come on, boys.

1542
01:49:06,490 --> 01:49:08,482
Has it stopped raining?

1543
01:49:08,530 --> 01:49:12,526
If there are any puddles,
you'll carry me, won't you, boys?

1544
01:49:21,729 --> 01:49:23,925
You two, watch out for those two.

1545
01:49:23,973 --> 01:49:25,929
(Both) Yes, sir.

1546
01:49:31,371 --> 01:49:34,521
- And you watch out for them.
- That ought to do it.

1547
01:49:44,133 --> 01:49:47,049
He said there were two plugs in your kisser.

1548
01:49:47,097 --> 01:49:50,247
There ought to be.
I'm sorry about everything.

1549
01:49:50,295 --> 01:49:52,935
- Except the time with you.
- Take that away.

1550
01:49:52,977 --> 01:49:56,853
It's true. With all the headaches ahead,
you'll be my aspirin.

1551
01:49:56,895 --> 01:49:59,091
That's nice, but what about my headache?

1552
01:49:59,133 --> 01:50:01,089
You're on your way back home.

1553
01:50:01,137 --> 01:50:04,731
You'll be all right by the time
you fasten your seat belt.

1554
01:50:04,773 --> 01:50:06,735
I love you, John.

1555
01:50:08,337 --> 01:50:11,727
No, you don't. I'm just a hit-and-run boy.

1556
01:50:11,775 --> 01:50:14,769
The kind of guy you need
is somebody to marry.

1557
01:50:14,817 --> 01:50:16,407
Well?

1558
01:50:16,455 --> 01:50:19,293
Oh, no. I'm not somebody anybody marries.

1559
01:50:20,378 --> 01:50:26,168
You need somebody respectable,
a senator, a Supreme Court judge,

1560
01:50:26,216 --> 01:50:30,098
maybe... somebody from
the Smithsonian Institute.

1561
01:50:30,140 --> 01:50:31,730
I know who I want.

1562
01:50:31,778 --> 01:50:34,418
Not me, I'm a heel, a certified heel.

1563
01:50:34,460 --> 01:50:37,016
I got documents to prove it.

1564
01:50:37,058 --> 01:50:39,254
Listen...

1565
01:50:39,296 --> 01:50:43,292
"Listen, my children, and you shall hear
of the midnight ride of Paul Revere

1566
01:50:43,340 --> 01:50:47,492
"On the 18th of April in '75, hardly a man
is now alive who remembers..."

1567
01:50:47,540 --> 01:50:49,532
(Glass smashing)

1568
01:50:50,180 --> 01:50:51,452
Oh...

1569
01:51:02,553 --> 01:51:08,253
