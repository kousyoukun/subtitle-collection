1
00:01:58,886 --> 00:02:02,656
Congressmen, we're now
flying over the heart of Berlin.

2
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,659
Berlin.

3
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:10,797
Over 75,000 tons of explosives
were dropped here.

4
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:14,101
British Lancasters by night,
American Fortresses by day.

5
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:18,138
I heard Russian artillery
had a little part in it too, if you don't mind.

6
00:02:18,172 --> 00:02:21,708
Sure they did and I wish
they'd pay us for all those cannons.

7
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:25,712
Hey, quit juggling. Film like this
is good stuff around election time.

8
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:27,381
The incumbent overseas.

9
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,184
Pennecot, don't you want to see it?
Look at it.

10
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:34,922
Like pack rats been gnawing at a hunk
of old mouldy Roquefort cheese.

11
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:44,765
Miss Frost? Congresswoman Frost?

12
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:47,434
- Present.
- We're flying over Berlin.

13
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:52,472
15 minutes ahead of schedule.

14
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,942
Well, don't you want to see it?

15
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,044
One thing at a time.

16
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:39,653
You got quite a sight coming.
Looks like chicken innards at frying time.

17
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,422
Considering the taxpayers' money
poured on it,

18
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:44,925
I don't expect it to look like a lace Valentine.

19
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,064
Golly.

20
00:03:56,336 --> 00:04:00,307
Well, that's rough doing.
That sure is rough doing.

21
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:08,549
They ought to put in grass
and move in a herd of longhorn.

22
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:12,219
Build up their industries.
Get those smokestacks belching again.

23
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:15,522
- Not without organised labour.
- We got to feed the people.

24
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,792
You can't keep a country
eating scraps out of garbage pails.

25
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:22,129
I'm all for sending food,
only let 'em know where it's from.

26
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:24,264
I object to dollar diplomacy.

27
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:27,601
- But you don't mind sending food.
- There's a difference.

28
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:30,337
If you give a hungry man bread,
that's democracy.

29
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:33,307
If you leave the wrapper on, it's imperialism.

30
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:37,077
Gentlemen, these are
very grave problems indeed

31
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:40,447
but they don't happen to be
the problems of this committee.

32
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:43,550
Perhaps I should remind you
why we were sent to Berlin,

33
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:46,486
since our chairman,
Mr Pennecot of New Hampshire,

34
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:50,824
has been indisposed ever since
we took off from Washington.

35
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:55,162
We're here to investigate the morale
of American occupation troops,

36
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:57,097
nothing else.

37
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,667
12,000 of our boys are policing
that pest hole down below

38
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:06,006
and according to reports, they are being
infected by a kind of moral malaria.

39
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:10,878
It is our duty to their wives, their mothers,
their sisters, to find the facts.

40
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:12,980
And if these reports are true,

41
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:17,384
to fumigate that place with
all the insecticides at our disposal.

42
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:21,388
If you'll pardon me,
we're approaching Tempelhof Airfield.

43
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:26,093
Oh, God, if they haven't got
a reception out for us.

44
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,061
A band and everything.

45
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:30,397
They'll be glad to see home folks.

46
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:45,412
Men, once more it is our honour and
privilege to welcome a visiting committee.

47
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:49,983
Lately they seem to be coming
as regularly as the electric bill.

48
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,519
This time it's not just VIPs.

49
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:55,389
This time we're getting VIPIs.

50
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:58,258
Very Important Persons Indeed.

51
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:02,963
Some Congressional committee
to investigate our morale.

52
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:07,668
Seems back home, they've got an idea
this here is one great big picnic,

53
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:11,271
that all we do is swing in hammocks
with blonde Frдuleins,

54
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:13,473
swap cigarettes for castles on the Rhine

55
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:16,210
and soak our feet in sparkling Mosel.

56
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:18,378
Well, let's not kid ourselves.

57
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:21,281
Some of you do go
overboard once in a while.

58
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:25,652
Maybe some of you are working too hard
to enlighten the civilian population

59
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:28,488
and maybe some of you
PX millionaires have found out

60
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:32,793
you can parlay a pack of cigarettes
into something more than 20 smokes.

61
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,896
After all, this isn't a Boy Scout camp.

62
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,831
We've got a tough job on our hands

63
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:41,168
and, by and large,
I think we're handling it darn well.

64
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:43,971
For my dough, we're on the ball.

65
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:46,807
Most of us, anyway... most of the time.

66
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,913
What they've got to realise is you can't pin
sergeant's stripes on an archangel.

67
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:56,016
Now, this committee
is going to be here for five days.

68
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:58,886
Let's give them as good
an impression as possible.

69
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:01,755
Not pussyfooting
around with a phoney attitude.

70
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,491
That's not fair to them or us.

71
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:07,594
I'm counting on you men to behave, period.

72
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:12,699
Morale. Maybe some day we can send
a little committee of our own

73
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:15,202
to investigate morale in Washington, DC.

74
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:24,344
Hey, look what I picked up
at the Brandenburg Gate.

75
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,048
- How much?
- A dozen candy bars.

76
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,251
They've still got some nine and a halfs.

77
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:33,754
- I got no one to give them to.
- How about Trudy?

78
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:37,591
I lost her. Russian sergeant came along
with a pound of rancid butter.

79
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,894
- Those German dames are all alike.
- Speak for yourself.

80
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:44,832
I wouldn't be afraid
of a Russian general with a ton of caviar.

81
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:47,734
Nice toe.

82
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,005
The best.

83
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:03,884
We're here, Congressman.
Ready to unload?

84
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:17,130
Present... arms!

85
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:37,718
- Hello, Colonel.
- Nice to see you, General.

86
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:42,022
Mr Giffin from Texas, General Finney,
General McAndrew, Colonel Plummer.

87
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:44,391
- My pleasure.
- Mr Salvatore, from New York.

88
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:48,061
- The Bronx.
- Nobody's going to think you're Wall Street.

89
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:52,199
Mr Yandell, Congressman from Virginia.
Mr Kraus, Congressman from Illinois.

90
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:55,969
Hold it, everybody.
Want to get some of this brass.

91
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:57,905
Snappy little outfit you have.

92
00:08:57,938 --> 00:09:00,207
Thank you. I have to apologise for the band.

93
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:03,410
- You should indeed.
- We're half strength today.

94
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:06,113
- We generally have 40 pieces.
- That's terrible.

95
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,217
We sent the others to the British sector
for a parade. It's Empire Day.

96
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,922
What's terrible is I came hoping to find
an army taking its task with seriousness.

97
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:17,457
Instead I find you have a 40-piece band.

98
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:19,960
Perhaps you also have
some drum majorettes.

99
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:21,562
- May I introduce...
- I know.

100
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:24,731
General Finney, General McAndrew
and Colonel Plummer.

101
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:28,769
It's in my data. I am Miss Frost,
Congresswoman from Iowa, 9th district.

102
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:32,573
Delightful of Congress to send us
a lady representative for a change.

103
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:33,740
Delightful.

104
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:37,544
May I suggest here and now that
we dispense with all the soft soap.

105
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:40,881
As committee chairman,
permit me to bring you greetings

106
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,951
from the people
of the United States of America.

107
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:49,056
This genial reception augurs well
for the success of our mission.

108
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:53,861
I sincerely hope so. And now let us proceed
to a luncheon we have prepared for you.

109
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:58,732
A very simple luncheon. Powdered egg
omelette, probably, and a little Spam.

110
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:08,475
- Can I carry that for you?
- No, thank you.

111
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:12,279
I undertook to deliver it in person
to a Captain John Pringle,

112
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:14,815
stationed somewhere in Berlin, G2 Section.

113
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:17,951
- Could you tell me how to go about it?
- I could try.

114
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:21,455
Through army channels?
All I have is five days.

115
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:22,589
Captain Pringle!

116
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:25,993
Captain Pringle!

117
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:31,899
Captain Pringle reporting, sir.

118
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:34,768
Congresswoman Frost,
this is Captain Pringle.

119
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:38,338
Thank you. This is for you,
Captain Pringle. Happy birthday.

120
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:41,942
Or happy birthday yesterday.
I thought I could deliver it on time

121
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:45,345
but we were held up
in Newfoundland for 16 hours - fog.

122
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:48,815
- You brought this from America?
- Murdoch, Iowa.

123
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,185
Well, how is good old Iowa?

124
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:53,320
62°% Republican, thank you.

125
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:57,958
I was entrusted with this by a constituent,
or rather, his daughter.

126
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,661
I hope it's still in one piece. Open it.

127
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:02,563
Be glad.

128
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:14,608
Well, what do you know? Little Dusty.

129
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,779
It's a beauty.

130
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:20,948
I didn't know it was so personal.

131
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:25,586
Her name is really Pauline Rose
but we call her Dusty. Some joke.

132
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:29,356
- How long since you've seen her?
- Dusty? Four years.

133
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:32,960
Don't these boys ever get home?
Can't they be given a short leave?

134
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:36,063
- Certainly, if it's accrued.
- I don't want any leave.

135
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:39,199
- You don't?
- Oh, of course I do. Dying to.

136
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:42,369
We're all homesick
but personal feelings don't matter.

137
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,471
There's unfinished business here.

138
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:47,774
Now that we've won the war,
we mustn't lose the peace.

139
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:51,578
I hate to think of anybody
sitting in his lonely barracks

140
00:11:51,612 --> 00:11:53,514
with a birthday cake on his knees.

141
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:56,850
I won't have the cake on my knees.
I won't be alone.

142
00:11:57,885 --> 00:12:00,320
There'll be my buddies. I'll call them in.

143
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:03,624
We'll open up a case of root beer,
light the candles,

144
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,893
then Frankovitch and his ukulele.

145
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:10,297
Some old songs.
Why, it'll be like back home... almost.

146
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,132
Good to hear you talk like that.

147
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,301
General Finney wants you to go in his car.

148
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,802
I'll be right with you.

149
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:20,607
If you're a sample of the spirit
prevailing in Berlin, I feel better already.

150
00:12:20,674 --> 00:12:23,143
- I'm a sample, all right.
- Goodbye.

151
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:31,185
You're losing something, Captain Pringle.

152
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,821
My handkerchief.

153
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:36,323
You blow your nose in nylon nowadays?

154
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:42,663
What do you know? There must have
been a mistake at the laundry.

155
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:46,433
We got a crazy old laundress.
You know what happened to Frankovitch?

156
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:50,137
He sent out his shorts and got back a girdle.

157
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:11,825
Ask her how much.

158
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:18,832
800 cigarettes, or coffee.

159
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,324
No. This watch gold. Gold for teeth.

160
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,727
- A watch from steel.
- How's this?

161
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,429
No, this silver. Want steel.

162
00:13:49,463 --> 00:13:51,365
You want steel.

163
00:13:51,398 --> 00:13:55,669
No, want round watch, very big, nice face.

164
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:59,640
You're tough. All right,
let's look in the other drawer.

165
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:05,312
Mickey Mouse! Mickey Mouse!

166
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:07,414
- How much?
- $700.

167
00:14:08,482 --> 00:14:11,919
- You got three like this watch, maybe?
- We'll see.

168
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:25,732
Herr Captain, buy porcelain?
Little Cupid to take for wife?

169
00:14:25,766 --> 00:14:28,902
Never mind the knick-knacks.
How much for the mattress?

170
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:31,872
- Why you want the mattress?
- I'm sleepy.

171
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:35,342
How much for the mattress?

172
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:39,580
What do you mean, "nein, nein, no"?

173
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:41,715
Look what you can get for it.

174
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:49,623
12 eggs in it and look at
the writing on it and the candles.

175
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,193
The candles alone are worth the mattress.
Get lost.

176
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:55,115
Yoo-hoo!

177
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:58,952
Erika! Erika!

178
00:17:18,572 --> 00:17:21,275
Sit down, Johnny.

179
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:28,382
Go away, Johnny, sit down.

180
00:17:47,668 --> 00:17:49,336
Johnny.

181
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:51,872
Johnny, what are you doing?

182
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:55,075
- I'm wiping my face.
- You're hurting me, Johnny.

183
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:58,378
You're always hurting me.
Why are you so mean to me?

184
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:01,748
I worry about you. I scrounge around,
I bring you presents

185
00:18:01,782 --> 00:18:03,517
and you tell me I'm mean to you.

186
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:07,554
You brought me a present? Where is it?
Where have you got it?

187
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:09,690
Ohh...

188
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:14,027
Johnny, they're so sheer. So beautiful.

189
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:17,397
52 gauge. So I'm mean to you?

190
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:20,734
- No, you're good to me.
- You bet I am.

191
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:25,072
You don't know how good. I bought
you another present. You're not gonna get it.

192
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:28,375
Another one? Where have you got it?
Where is it, Johnny?

193
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:31,411
- Keep away.
- Is it here? Tell me...

194
00:18:32,746 --> 00:18:37,151
Johnny...

195
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:39,987
- Where did you get it?
- A friend of mine baked it.

196
00:18:40,087 --> 00:18:43,991
Only you're not going to get it. Why
should I care whether you sleep or not?

197
00:18:44,024 --> 00:18:48,095
Johnny, for 15 years
we haven't slept in Germany.

198
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:51,732
First it was Hitler screaming on the radio,
then the war of nerves,

199
00:18:51,765 --> 00:18:54,034
then the victory celebrations,

200
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:56,136
then the bombing.

201
00:18:56,203 --> 00:18:58,238
All the furniture burnt.

202
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:00,207
See?

203
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:05,813
That one I hate worst.
Give me that mattress, Johnny.

204
00:19:05,846 --> 00:19:07,915
No mattress will help you sleep.

205
00:19:07,948 --> 00:19:10,450
What you Germans need
is a better conscience.

206
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,386
I have a good conscience.

207
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:15,722
I have a new Fьhrer now... you.

208
00:19:15,756 --> 00:19:17,057
Heil, Johnny.

209
00:19:17,191 --> 00:19:19,893
You heil me once more
and I'll knock your teeth in.

210
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:21,829
You'll bruise your lips.

211
00:19:21,862 --> 00:19:25,132
Why don't I choke you a little?
Break you in two?

212
00:19:25,966 --> 00:19:28,802
Build a fire under you, you blonde witch.

213
00:19:30,404 --> 00:19:32,072
Who's that?

214
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:34,174
With my luck, it's Eisenhower.

215
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,519
- Yes.
- Your name Schlьtow?

216
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:48,422
- I beg your pardon.
- Is your name Erika Schlьtow?

217
00:19:48,489 --> 00:19:50,557
- No.
- You live here, don't you?

218
00:19:50,591 --> 00:19:52,059
Yes, I live here.

219
00:19:52,092 --> 00:19:54,962
You the dame that sings
at the Lorelei nightclub?

220
00:19:54,995 --> 00:19:58,799
- Yes, I sing there.
- And your name's not Erika Schlьtow?

221
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:02,636
My name is Erika von Schlьtow.

222
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:04,771
- A von?
- She's a von.

223
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:07,708
Nobility. We beg your highness's pardon.

224
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:10,544
- What do you want?
- A little information.

225
00:20:10,611 --> 00:20:15,716
It says here that a certain Erika Schlьtow...
von Schlьtow, pardon I...

226
00:20:15,749 --> 00:20:19,019
has been an active von Nazi
ever since 19- von - 35.

227
00:20:20,354 --> 00:20:22,422
Go on, gentlemen.

228
00:20:22,456 --> 00:20:25,826
It says that Miss von Schlьtow
was ordered over a month ago

229
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:28,762
to a von labour camp
to pick up some von bricks.

230
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:32,065
- What else does it say?
- You're working at a night joint.

231
00:20:32,132 --> 00:20:35,736
According to this report,
what you're moving there ain't bricks.

232
00:20:35,836 --> 00:20:40,874
I'm an artist, gentlemen, not a street
cleaner, and I've been completely cleared.

233
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:43,010
Yeah? Tell us all about it.

234
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:46,580
My case has been reviewed
and the decision reversed.

235
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:48,916
I'm on the white list now.

236
00:20:49,783 --> 00:20:54,822
With that record? If you make the white list,
we'll make the hit parade.

237
00:20:54,888 --> 00:20:57,591
- OK, von sister, get your things on.
- What for?

238
00:20:57,691 --> 00:21:01,161
We're taking you to
the von denazification office.

239
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:10,304
Now, Abbot and Costello,
show me your orders.

240
00:21:10,337 --> 00:21:12,239
- Yes, sir.
- Who gave you these?

241
00:21:12,306 --> 00:21:14,341
- Lieutenant Clark, sir.
- Four weeks old.

242
00:21:14,408 --> 00:21:16,276
We've had a lot of people to check.

243
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:19,847
Paperwork, that's why we're always
fouled up when a war starts.

244
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,450
Takes us six months to clear up
the paperwork from the last one.

245
00:21:23,484 --> 00:21:26,453
I'll talk to Clark.
This case is straightened out.

246
00:21:26,487 --> 00:21:29,223
- Sorry, sir.
- OK. That's all. Take off.

247
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,963
- May I have that, please?
- Sorry.

248
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:43,203
Take an ordinary guy, make him an MP,
suddenly he gets to be eight feet tall.

249
00:21:43,237 --> 00:21:47,141
- If they look into the files for my papers.
- Stop worrying. They're OK.

250
00:21:47,207 --> 00:21:51,145
- Goodbye. I got a desk full of work.
- Did the Colonel sign my papers?

251
00:21:51,178 --> 00:21:55,215
Not exactly. He was out of the office
having his tonsils swabbed.

252
00:21:55,249 --> 00:21:58,519
- The duty officer signed them.
- Who was the duty officer?

253
00:21:58,552 --> 00:22:00,187
I was.

254
00:22:00,287 --> 00:22:04,391
Johnny, if they find out you know me,
that's very dangerous.

255
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,560
Everything is dangerous.

256
00:22:06,627 --> 00:22:11,298
I know an old lady back home,
broke her leg stepping into a church pew.

257
00:22:12,232 --> 00:22:14,067
See you, baby.

258
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:20,140
Johnny! When you come back,
bring me some sugar.

259
00:22:20,174 --> 00:22:22,042
- Yeah, sure.
- And some soap.

260
00:22:22,142 --> 00:22:24,211
And hairpins.

261
00:22:24,278 --> 00:22:28,182
- Anything else?
- A pillow to go with that mattress.

262
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:31,652
Ah, you gorgeous booby trap.

263
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,521
Yahoo!

264
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,229
On your left is the Russian war memorial,

265
00:22:42,262 --> 00:22:45,699
built in honour of their soldiers
killed in the battle of Berlin.

266
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:48,836
Those tanks on the side
were the first to enter Berlin.

267
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:53,574
Beyond it, the Reichstag,
the German house of representatives.

268
00:22:53,607 --> 00:22:57,878
That's the building set on fire in 1933
and blamed on a poor Dutchman.

269
00:22:57,911 --> 00:23:00,747
The word got out it was Hitler
who threw the match.

270
00:23:00,814 --> 00:23:06,153
They used to say it's the first time in history
a man gave himself the hotfoot.

271
00:23:10,624 --> 00:23:15,629
The Brandenburg Gate, an arch of triumph
until they got out of the habit.

272
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:19,233
That rubble heap over there
was the American embassy.

273
00:23:19,266 --> 00:23:22,569
You can't tell now but this spot
was once the heart of Europe.

274
00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:24,905
The street is the famous Unter den Linden,

275
00:23:24,972 --> 00:23:28,675
named after the linden trees,
which they've replanted now.

276
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:31,478
That pile of stone over there
was the Adlon Hotel,

277
00:23:31,512 --> 00:23:35,315
just after the 8th Air Force
checked in for the weekend.

278
00:23:35,349 --> 00:23:38,018
Now, let's look at the WilhelmstraЯe.

279
00:23:39,653 --> 00:23:43,657
Here's the Reich Chancellery where
the Fьhrer fixed himself up a duplex.

280
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:47,995
As it turned out, one part got to be a big
padded cell and the other a mortuary.

281
00:23:48,028 --> 00:23:50,164
Underneath is a concrete basement,

282
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:53,767
where he married Eva Braun
and where they killed themselves.

283
00:23:53,834 --> 00:23:56,904
A lot of people say it was
the perfect honeymoon.

284
00:23:58,305 --> 00:24:03,410
Over there is the balcony where he bet
his Reich would last a thousand years.

285
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:06,713
That's the one that broke
the bookies' hearts.

286
00:24:09,249 --> 00:24:13,487
This is the Tiergarten,
used to be the Central Park of Berlin.

287
00:24:13,554 --> 00:24:18,258
Those two big cement things are
the zoo bunkers, enormous pillboxes.

288
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:21,595
They were the last two buildings
in Berlin to surrender.

289
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:46,620
I thought you'd be interested
in a typical Berlin residential area.

290
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:49,923
If you look hard,
you'll see the houses are empty shells,

291
00:24:49,957 --> 00:24:53,026
completely burned out by incendiaries.

292
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,796
Life goes on in those ruins, though.

293
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:17,551
That used to be
the largest department store in Berlin.

294
00:25:17,584 --> 00:25:22,856
It was 12 storeys high. Later on it became
headquarters for the storm troopers.

295
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:28,195
They blew it up themselves.
The idea was to destroy all their records.

296
00:25:28,262 --> 00:25:32,900
They overlooked the fact that most
of them were in fireproof vaults.

297
00:25:53,754 --> 00:25:55,656
Excuse me.

298
00:26:01,328 --> 00:26:03,030
Well.

299
00:26:03,931 --> 00:26:07,868
This is one of our youth clubs. We've
got a lot of them in the American zone.

300
00:26:07,935 --> 00:26:12,272
We had quite a problem. Those weren't
ordinary youngsters when we came in.

301
00:26:12,306 --> 00:26:16,643
They were mean old men. Now we're
trying to make kids of them again.

302
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:20,447
We had to kick the goose step out of them
and cure them of blind obedience

303
00:26:20,481 --> 00:26:22,649
and teach them to beep at the referee.

304
00:26:22,683 --> 00:26:25,452
If they want to steal,
make sure it's second base.

305
00:26:30,491 --> 00:26:34,394
One thing they don't have to worry about
round here, breaking windows.

306
00:26:34,461 --> 00:26:37,898
One family has already
christened a kid DiMaggio Schultz.

307
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:40,667
That's when I started believing
we'd won the war.

308
00:26:52,379 --> 00:26:55,382
Hey, Frдulein! Hey, Frдulein!

309
00:26:57,885 --> 00:27:00,787
Hey, Frдulein! Hey, Frдulein!

310
00:27:10,264 --> 00:27:12,766
No, no, no.

311
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:17,171
Come on. What's the matter with you two?
Just a little Spazierfahren in the park.

312
00:27:17,204 --> 00:27:21,008
Nein, we don't bicycle. We automobile.

313
00:27:21,542 --> 00:27:24,278
Automobile? You got yourselves officers?

314
00:27:24,311 --> 00:27:27,848
French officers.

315
00:27:27,881 --> 00:27:31,618
OK. So they got an automobile
but we got the candy bar.

316
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:40,494
Ah, your Fьhrer's moustache.

317
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,736
Hey, Doctor, I got a lady on the balcony.

318
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:52,773
Size 14.

319
00:27:52,806 --> 00:27:55,275
Hey, Frдulein! Hey, Frдulein!

320
00:27:55,309 --> 00:27:59,847
Hey, Frдulein! Stop, Frдulein!

321
00:28:02,115 --> 00:28:04,952
- Guten afternoon, Frдulein.
- Hello, Frдulein.

322
00:28:06,954 --> 00:28:10,023
Das is my friend Brigadier General Mike.

323
00:28:10,057 --> 00:28:12,326
And das is mein Freund,
Lieutenant General Joe.

324
00:28:12,392 --> 00:28:13,694
Jawohl.

325
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,196
You know, you're a nice little strudel.

326
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,499
Hey, hands off. I saw her first.

327
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:22,569
Frдulein, would you like
a little SpaЯmachen,

328
00:28:22,636 --> 00:28:26,473
- Biertrinken and Tanzen making?
- Jawohl.

329
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:30,043
She must be tetched in the wool.
All she can say is, "Jawohl".

330
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:37,651
Frдulein, Frдulein, willst du ein candy bar

331
00:28:37,684 --> 00:28:41,922
Schцn, fein Frдulein,
you like Gls, nicht wahr?

332
00:28:41,989 --> 00:28:44,057
At home though you won't believe us

333
00:28:44,091 --> 00:28:46,160
The girls could take or leave us

334
00:28:46,193 --> 00:28:51,298
But here we squares is millionaires,
ach, du wunderbar candy bar

335
00:28:51,331 --> 00:28:54,468
Don't give her that candy bar yet.
Are you crazy?

336
00:28:54,501 --> 00:28:58,438
- I ain't giving. I'm just showing.
- Say, was ist your name?

337
00:29:01,742 --> 00:29:04,144
- Er, Gretchen.
- Gretchen what?

338
00:29:05,312 --> 00:29:08,582
- Gesundheit. Gretchen Gesundheit.
- Gesundheit!

339
00:29:08,615 --> 00:29:11,919
How do you like that?
We're fraternising with a sneeze.

340
00:29:11,952 --> 00:29:15,222
Gretchen, Gretchen...

341
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:04,338
- I'm sorry. It's five packs now.
- Four packs.

342
00:30:04,404 --> 00:30:07,908
Five packs for champagne,
three for wine, one for beer.

343
00:30:07,975 --> 00:30:12,045
This is eine kleine clip joint. Here's your tip.

344
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:16,283
How do you like these prices? We got
to write Congress to boost our PX ration.

345
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:20,988
Fat chance. All them schmoes think about
is coal strikes, flood control, United Nations.

346
00:30:21,021 --> 00:30:24,758
What's Congress? A bunch of salesmen
with their foot in the right door.

347
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:27,728
For my dough, you can have
Congress and the Senate.

348
00:30:27,761 --> 00:30:29,897
- I'll take it.
- You got it.

349
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:35,803
Hey!

350
00:30:47,915 --> 00:30:50,551
What a bunch of cut-ups.

351
00:30:50,584 --> 00:30:54,721
Hey, Gretchen, you live with your mother?

352
00:30:54,788 --> 00:30:56,657
What business is it of yours?

353
00:30:56,723 --> 00:30:59,193
Look, what do you want, the whole family?

354
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:02,463
You pulling a trick like the one
with the Schultz sisters?

355
00:31:02,496 --> 00:31:04,898
Nein, nein, you Soldaten, United States.

356
00:31:04,998 --> 00:31:07,034
Fry the uniformen.

357
00:31:26,653 --> 00:31:28,455
Shh!

358
00:31:30,524 --> 00:31:33,727
Black market

359
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,698
Sneak around the corner,
BudapesterstraЯe

360
00:31:37,798 --> 00:31:39,933
Black market

361
00:31:39,967 --> 00:31:42,269
Peek around the corner

362
00:31:45,205 --> 00:31:49,810
Come, I'll show you things
you cannot get elsewhere

363
00:31:50,677 --> 00:31:56,016
Come, make with the offers
and you'll get your share

364
00:31:57,284 --> 00:31:59,553
Black market

365
00:31:59,586 --> 00:32:01,488

Smiles for cigarettes

367
00:32:04,992 --> 00:32:07,060
Got some broken-down ideals?

368
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:11,031
Like wedding rings?

369
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:13,767
Shh.

370
00:32:13,801 --> 00:32:16,236
Tiptoe

371
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:18,338
Trade your things

372
00:32:26,046 --> 00:32:31,084
I'll trade you for your candy

373
00:32:32,252 --> 00:32:36,156
Some gorgeous merchandise

374
00:32:37,758 --> 00:32:41,528
My camera, it's a dandy

375
00:32:43,063 --> 00:32:45,132
Six by nine

376
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:48,168
Just your size

377
00:32:49,169 --> 00:32:53,874
You want my porcelain figure?

378
00:32:54,942 --> 00:32:59,213
A watch? A submarine?

379
00:32:59,246 --> 00:33:04,218
A Rembrandt? Salami?
Black lingerie from Wien?

380
00:33:04,318 --> 00:33:11,191
I sell my goods behind the screen

381
00:33:11,225 --> 00:33:14,895
No ceiling, no feeling

382
00:33:14,962 --> 00:33:18,499
A very smooth routine

383
00:33:18,532 --> 00:33:20,834
You buy these goods

384
00:33:22,402 --> 00:33:28,008
And, boy, these goods are keen

385
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:43,590
Black market

386
00:33:43,624 --> 00:33:47,561
Laces for the missus,
chewing gum for kisses

387
00:33:47,628 --> 00:33:49,963
Black market

388
00:33:49,997 --> 00:33:52,099
Cuckoo clocks and bangles

389
00:33:52,132 --> 00:33:54,902
Thousand little angles

390
00:33:54,935 --> 00:33:59,907
Come and see my little music box today

391
00:34:00,808 --> 00:34:02,676
Price?

392
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:05,512
Only six cartons

393
00:34:05,579 --> 00:34:07,815
Want to hear it play?

394
00:34:07,915 --> 00:34:10,184

00:34:17,224 --> 00:34:19,593
I've got so many toys

398
00:34:21,361 --> 00:34:23,430
Don't be bashful

399
00:34:24,298 --> 00:34:26,366
Step up, boys

400
00:34:33,474 --> 00:34:38,745
You'll like my first edition

401
00:34:38,779 --> 00:34:40,814
It's yours

402
00:34:40,848 --> 00:34:43,283
That's how I am

403
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:47,154
A simple definition

404
00:34:47,187 --> 00:34:49,623
You take art

405
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:52,126
I take Spam

406
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,929
To you for your K ration

407
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:59,032
Compassion

408
00:34:59,066 --> 00:35:03,403
And maybe an inkling

409
00:35:03,437 --> 00:35:07,574
A twinkling of real sympathy

410
00:35:07,641 --> 00:35:10,077
I'm selling out

411
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:12,579
Take all I've got

412
00:35:12,613 --> 00:35:16,617
Ambitions, conviction, the works

413
00:35:17,918 --> 00:35:20,187
Why not?

414
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,289
Enjoy these goods

415
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:29,296
For, boy, these goods... are hot

416
00:35:45,612 --> 00:35:51,018
Boy, that's strudel. That's the kind of pastry
makes you drool on your bib.

417
00:35:51,084 --> 00:35:54,354
You know what they say?
She was up there with them big Nazis.

418
00:35:54,388 --> 00:35:58,725
Right in the major league.
She was Goebbels' girl or Gцring's.

419
00:35:58,792 --> 00:36:02,329
- How did she get away with it?
- Just look at her.

420
00:36:02,362 --> 00:36:05,065
- She's hooked herself some big brass.
- Who?

421
00:36:05,132 --> 00:36:09,336
All I know is, some big shot's
running interference for her.

422
00:36:13,273 --> 00:36:14,708
Jawohl.

423
00:36:15,843 --> 00:36:19,313
Listen, if anybody's dancing...
Come on, Gesundheit.

424
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,603
- What's the matter?
- Let go of me, you ape.

425
00:36:42,636 --> 00:36:45,606
- What kind of language...
- I said ape and I meant ape.

426
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:47,441
Hey! Hey!

427
00:36:49,776 --> 00:36:52,479
- Where did you get that cake?
- Hey, Mike.

428
00:36:52,513 --> 00:36:54,581
I demand to know where you got that cake.

429
00:36:54,648 --> 00:36:56,784
What you want?

430
00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:00,120
Where'd this restaurant get food?
Our business, not yours.

431
00:37:00,154 --> 00:37:01,622
I'm making it my business.

432
00:37:03,791 --> 00:37:05,793
I happen to know all about that cake

433
00:37:05,826 --> 00:37:09,096
and I am a Congresswoman
of the United States of America.

434
00:37:09,797 --> 00:37:12,633
- Some strudel you picked.
- Yeah, let's go.

435
00:37:16,937 --> 00:37:19,239
Put back that slice of the cake.

436
00:37:19,273 --> 00:37:22,142
Take out the knife.
I want to know what it is doing here.

437
00:37:22,209 --> 00:37:24,578
- It is being eaten.
- That's enough.

438
00:37:24,611 --> 00:37:26,680
- This cake is confiscated.
- Hello.

439
00:37:26,713 --> 00:37:30,217
- How do you do? So that's where it is.
- What do you know about this?

440
00:37:30,284 --> 00:37:32,486
Very little. It was stolen out of my Jeep.

441
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:35,556
- It was?
- Stolen and sold on the black market.

442
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:38,325
They'll steal anything around here.

443
00:37:38,325 --> 00:37:42,095
- When I think of that girl back in Iowa...
- Yeah.

444
00:37:42,162 --> 00:37:44,798
I'll take care of this. Don't trouble yourself.

445
00:37:44,865 --> 00:37:49,102
Thank you. Will you also take care
of a pair of disgusting soldiers

446
00:37:49,136 --> 00:37:51,972
who should be stood up against a wall and...

447
00:37:53,106 --> 00:37:54,541
Oh.

448
00:37:54,575 --> 00:37:58,779
I want you to find them.
They're medium height. One is a little taller.

449
00:37:58,879 --> 00:38:03,117
Their names are Mike and Joe and
they're in uniforms with US on the collar.

450
00:38:03,183 --> 00:38:04,485
Perfect sense, ma'am.

451
00:38:04,551 --> 00:38:07,187
Now, what exactly is
the name of this sewer?

452
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:08,889
- The Lorelei.
- Address?

453
00:38:08,922 --> 00:38:12,593
- Number 15, HagenbachstraЯe.
- Are there other sewers like this?

454
00:38:12,626 --> 00:38:16,263
- Three or four but this is the best.
- What is the name of that woman?

455
00:38:16,296 --> 00:38:18,098
- What woman?
- The singer here.

456
00:38:18,132 --> 00:38:21,301
Oh, the singer. I think it's Erika.

457
00:38:21,401 --> 00:38:24,905
- Erika what?
- Erika von Schlьtow.

458
00:38:24,972 --> 00:38:26,406
Why do you ask about her?

459
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:31,078
Because there's something funny going on
here and I'm not in the mood for laughs.

460
00:38:31,178 --> 00:38:33,447
Schlьtow? How do you spell it?

461
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,549
Schlьtow, with an umlaut.

462
00:38:35,582 --> 00:38:37,718
I thought so.

463
00:38:41,155 --> 00:38:44,024
I want you to remember
that when we moved into Germany,

464
00:38:44,057 --> 00:38:47,094
we found a country of
open graves and closed hearts.

465
00:38:47,127 --> 00:38:50,097
We've tried to turn it into a civilised state.

466
00:38:50,164 --> 00:38:53,901
We had to eliminate things
that breed unrest and aggression.

467
00:38:53,934 --> 00:38:57,204
We've tried to make them free men
and give them some dignity.

468
00:38:57,271 --> 00:39:01,208
We had to return four million
displaced persons to their homes.

469
00:39:01,241 --> 00:39:04,011
That's hard if you don't have
a home to start with.

470
00:39:04,044 --> 00:39:07,281
We had to repair hospitals
and public utilities.

471
00:39:07,314 --> 00:39:10,784
I remember the first day the gasworks
started operating again.

472
00:39:10,884 --> 00:39:14,354
There were 160 suicides in Berlin alone.

473
00:39:14,455 --> 00:39:16,290
That was ten months ago.

474
00:39:16,323 --> 00:39:20,694
Today, they take a match and light
the gas and boil some potatoes.

475
00:39:20,761 --> 00:39:24,465
Not many potatoes, mind you.
There is still a lot of hunger.

476
00:39:24,498 --> 00:39:26,700
But there is a new will to live.

477
00:39:26,733 --> 00:39:31,371
We had to build schools and find teachers
and then teach the teachers.

478
00:39:31,405 --> 00:39:35,809
We helped them start a free press
and institute a parliamentary government.

479
00:39:35,843 --> 00:39:38,479
They had their first free election in 14 years.

480
00:39:38,512 --> 00:39:41,048
It had been so long
they didn't know what to do.

481
00:39:41,115 --> 00:39:44,351
It was like handing
the village drunk a glass of water.

482
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:50,124
What I want to point out is that
it's a tough, thankless, lonely job.

483
00:39:50,157 --> 00:39:52,426
We're trying to lick it as well as we can.

484
00:39:52,493 --> 00:39:55,996
You might as well know,
some of us get out of line occasionally.

485
00:39:56,063 --> 00:39:58,732
But remember this.
For the first time in history,

486
00:39:58,765 --> 00:40:03,637
you are asking the same generation of
soldiers to be both valorous and wise.

487
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,572
- Mighty fine.
- Well said.

488
00:40:05,606 --> 00:40:09,309
I sure hope our chairman has
made notes of that speech of yours.

489
00:40:09,376 --> 00:40:12,079
I think it should be
incorporated in our report.

490
00:40:12,112 --> 00:40:15,382
Colonel, we buy every word of it, all of us.

491
00:40:15,482 --> 00:40:17,117
I don't.

492
00:40:18,118 --> 00:40:22,723
I wouldn't think of buying it. I'm surprised
at my colleagues' low sales resistance.

493
00:40:22,756 --> 00:40:26,260
Miss Frost, this attitude calls
for some explanation.

494
00:40:26,326 --> 00:40:28,595
Colonel Plummer, in your eloquent speech,

495
00:40:28,629 --> 00:40:30,998
which I'm sure you've made 50 times,

496
00:40:31,064 --> 00:40:34,968
you used the phrase "Some of our boys
may get out of line sometimes."

497
00:40:35,002 --> 00:40:37,337
That is a masterpiece of understatement.

498
00:40:37,371 --> 00:40:38,939
What are you driving at?

499
00:40:38,972 --> 00:40:43,777
In your effort to civilise this country,
our boys are becoming barbarians.

500
00:40:43,811 --> 00:40:47,147
- I explained on that tour...
- I know all about those tours.

501
00:40:47,214 --> 00:40:51,752
You put blinkers on us and make sure
we only see what you want us to see.

502
00:40:51,785 --> 00:40:55,556
Then you give us pamphlets,
statistics, a rousing speech

503
00:40:55,589 --> 00:40:58,759
and ship us back a little more
bamboozled than when we came.

504
00:40:58,759 --> 00:41:01,628
We could have learned
as much from Reader's Digest.

505
00:41:01,662 --> 00:41:05,199
- This is very embarrassing, Colonel.
- Go on, Miss Frost.

506
00:41:05,232 --> 00:41:08,202
Well, I don't like blinkers.
I look in all directions

507
00:41:08,235 --> 00:41:12,840
and when I suspect dirt's been swept
under a carpet, I turn up that carpet.

508
00:41:12,906 --> 00:41:16,210
- What carpet? What dirt?
- What dirt?

509
00:41:16,276 --> 00:41:20,681
- One day and this is filled with it.
- Please particularise.

510
00:41:20,714 --> 00:41:23,517
Gls consorting with German Frдuleins...

511
00:41:23,584 --> 00:41:25,052
Fraternisation is legal.

512
00:41:25,085 --> 00:41:29,056
...in wide-open, shameless,
black-market nightclubs.

513
00:41:30,057 --> 00:41:33,961
So we close them and our boys sneak off
to places in the Russian sector,

514
00:41:33,994 --> 00:41:37,164
or the British, or in the French,
and there's another thing.

515
00:41:37,264 --> 00:41:40,367
This is off the record.
Those places attract a lot of scum

516
00:41:40,467 --> 00:41:44,271
and we clean it up by cracking down
with a surprise raid once in a while.

517
00:41:44,271 --> 00:41:48,542
Notorious Nazi entertainers parading
themselves before our boys,

518
00:41:48,609 --> 00:41:51,612
- is that off the record too?
- For instance?

519
00:41:51,678 --> 00:41:56,283
I am specifically referring
to one Erika von Schlьtow,

520
00:41:56,316 --> 00:42:01,522
who works at a dive called the Lorelei,
15 HagenbachstraЯe.

521
00:42:01,588 --> 00:42:03,190
How can a creature...

522
00:42:08,595 --> 00:42:11,331
I insist on a satisfactory explanation.

523
00:42:11,365 --> 00:42:15,269
I must ask the Congresswoman
to drop this particular matter.

524
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:18,672
- Why?
- Some things must be left to our discretion.

525
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:23,343
Colonel Plummer, I didn't go for
the blinkers. Now, don't try a muzzle.

526
00:42:23,377 --> 00:42:27,014
The last time someone wanted to gag me,
he tried it with a mink coat

527
00:42:27,047 --> 00:42:32,786
but I never let go until the president of that
particular ship company wound up in jail,

528
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:35,956
even though I did get
pneumonia that winter.

529
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:41,728
Herr Maier, this is the second time
we've had complaints.

530
00:42:41,795 --> 00:42:45,199
I don't think it's a good idea
that your son... What's his name?

531
00:42:45,232 --> 00:42:46,300
Gerhard.

532
00:42:46,366 --> 00:42:51,004
That Gerhard should draw swastikas
all over the neighbourhood.

533
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:56,944
- I will break his arm.
- We've dissolved the Gestapo.

534
00:42:57,044 --> 00:43:01,648
No food, Bьrschchen.
I will lock him into a dark room.

535
00:43:01,715 --> 00:43:03,750
Why not just shove him in a gas chamber?

536
00:43:03,817 --> 00:43:04,918
Yes, Herr Kapitдn.

537
00:43:04,952 --> 00:43:07,788
Listen, we've done away
with concentration camps.

538
00:43:07,821 --> 00:43:11,358
Take him round to a G YA,
one of our German youth clubs.

539
00:43:11,391 --> 00:43:15,129
Some baseball and a little less
heel-clicking is what he needs.

540
00:43:15,162 --> 00:43:17,464
Here's the address. Ask for Sergeant Breen.

541
00:43:17,498 --> 00:43:19,333
Yes, Herr Kapitдn.

542
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,170
I mean, thank you, Herr Kapitдn.

543
00:43:23,237 --> 00:43:25,139
Auf Wiedersehen.

544
00:43:25,205 --> 00:43:27,241
Come, Bьrschchen.

545
00:43:34,314 --> 00:43:37,518
- Captain Pringle is wanted in 112.
- Who's that?

546
00:43:37,551 --> 00:43:40,187
That Congress dame,
whatever her name is.

547
00:43:40,287 --> 00:43:41,922
- Wants to see me?
- You, sir.

548
00:43:41,955 --> 00:43:44,224
- Now?
- Now. She's clucking like a hen.

549
00:43:44,258 --> 00:43:47,494
You'd better get there
before she lays an egg.

550
00:44:04,044 --> 00:44:06,780
- Captain Pringle reporting.
- Hello.

551
00:44:07,614 --> 00:44:10,918
- Lorelei, how do you spell it?
- Lorelei?

552
00:44:10,951 --> 00:44:13,020
l-E or E-I at the end?

553
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,755
E-I.

554
00:44:14,788 --> 00:44:16,657
Thank you.

555
00:44:19,226 --> 00:44:23,564
Captain Pringle, my belief in the army
has been shaken to the core.

556
00:44:23,597 --> 00:44:26,900
- Really?
- I can't trust anybody in uniform.

557
00:44:26,934 --> 00:44:28,535
Now, please...

558
00:44:28,569 --> 00:44:31,238
With one single exception, you.

559
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:33,373
Thank you, ma'am.

560
00:44:33,507 --> 00:44:35,809
I trust you because we're both Iowans.

561
00:44:35,843 --> 00:44:39,580
- Right back at you, Miss Frost.
- Moreover, you're a hard worker.

562
00:44:39,613 --> 00:44:42,049
Perhaps you work too hard. You look tired.

563
00:44:42,116 --> 00:44:44,418
Well, I hoped it didn't show.

564
00:44:46,086 --> 00:44:48,589
That is ink, Captain Pringle.

565
00:44:48,622 --> 00:44:49,923
So it is.

566
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:51,525
Captain, I need your help.

567
00:44:51,558 --> 00:44:55,529
I want some additional data
on Frдulein von Schlьtow.

568
00:44:55,596 --> 00:44:57,064
The one with the umlaut.

569
00:44:57,131 --> 00:45:00,868
- Oh, her.
- There must be a file on that woman.

570
00:45:00,934 --> 00:45:04,738
- Of course there is. Only it's not here.
- It isn't?

571
00:45:04,805 --> 00:45:07,541
I asked for it
and I was told it's gone to Nьrnberg.

572
00:45:07,574 --> 00:45:10,844
On account of the trials,
a lot of files have been sent there.

573
00:45:10,878 --> 00:45:12,746
- I see.
- I asked around, though.

574
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:15,749
- Did you find anything?
- Nothing important. Gossip.

575
00:45:15,783 --> 00:45:18,585
Are you sure? No fire with all that smoke?

576
00:45:18,619 --> 00:45:21,655
She may have known
a couple of minor party members.

577
00:45:21,688 --> 00:45:24,625
Nothing worth your attention.
Small fry, I'd say.

578
00:45:24,658 --> 00:45:27,394
- All right, ma'am, we're ready to go.
- Thank you.

579
00:45:27,427 --> 00:45:30,531
A warrant officer said he'd seen her
in an old newsreel,

580
00:45:30,597 --> 00:45:33,300
so I sent for the film from the Signal Corp.

581
00:45:37,671 --> 00:45:39,506
The Week In Pictures.

582
00:45:42,476 --> 00:45:45,779
This is a little Nazi get-together in Breslau.

583
00:45:51,351 --> 00:45:55,255
That's Goebbels telling them
how they're winning the war.

584
00:46:00,194 --> 00:46:03,263
Opening of the opera with Lohengrin
and famous guests.

585
00:46:03,297 --> 00:46:05,732
They fiddled big while Berlin burned.

586
00:46:05,833 --> 00:46:08,602
Lohengrin, you know, swan song.

587
00:46:12,206 --> 00:46:17,111
Now we're getting someplace.
I wonder what holds up that dress.

588
00:46:17,177 --> 00:46:19,746
Must be that German willpower.

589
00:46:19,847 --> 00:46:22,349
Who's that man?
I think it's Birgel.

590
00:46:22,416 --> 00:46:24,952
Who?
Hans Otto Birgel.

591
00:46:25,018 --> 00:46:27,054
Who is Hans Otto Birgel?

592
00:46:27,121 --> 00:46:30,791
He had something to do
with the Gestapo. He's dead.

593
00:46:30,824 --> 00:46:36,697
- Killed himself when the Russians came.
- An important party member?

594
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:38,632
So-so.

595
00:46:38,665 --> 00:46:41,735
Well, she must be his girlfriend.

596
00:46:41,768 --> 00:46:44,571
Maybe she doesn't know him.
Maybe she had a dizzy spell

597
00:46:44,605 --> 00:46:47,608
and the first thing she could catch
was his... elbow.

598
00:47:14,134 --> 00:47:16,403
That's enough. Thank you.

599
00:47:18,672 --> 00:47:22,776
Well, we've learned one thing.
No small fry is she.

600
00:47:22,876 --> 00:47:26,046
- I guess not.
- That a Nazi woman like that should...

601
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:29,383
I'll see she discontinues
her appearances as an entertainer.

602
00:47:29,416 --> 00:47:31,685
- Will that be satisfactory?
- It will not.

603
00:47:31,785 --> 00:47:34,421
What would you suggest, shave her head?

604
00:47:34,455 --> 00:47:36,123
- I'm not after her head.
- Well?

605
00:47:36,156 --> 00:47:39,927
It's common talk that an officer
in the army is protecting her.

606
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,530
- It's his head I'm after.
- You really think an officer?

607
00:47:43,564 --> 00:47:45,432
Incredible as it may seem.

608
00:47:45,466 --> 00:47:47,734
Now, let's use some common sense.

609
00:47:47,768 --> 00:47:51,538
That man is not giving her
his protection for platonic reasons.

610
00:47:51,572 --> 00:47:53,707
- Granted?
- Granted.

611
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:56,210
Of course the association is undercover.

612
00:47:56,276 --> 00:47:59,279
He's not stupid enough
to entertain her at his billet.

613
00:47:59,346 --> 00:48:03,250
- I guess that's right.
- We can therefore assume he visits her.

614
00:48:03,283 --> 00:48:05,385
Very logical.

615
00:48:05,419 --> 00:48:08,989
Therefore, to catch him,
we must watch her place.

616
00:48:09,022 --> 00:48:10,958
Smart idea.

617
00:48:10,991 --> 00:48:13,794
- You know where she lives?
- I can find out.

618
00:48:13,827 --> 00:48:17,097
And I shall watch it
day and night... personally.

619
00:48:17,164 --> 00:48:19,800
No, we'll watch it together, the two of us.

620
00:48:19,867 --> 00:48:23,437
- We will?
- Yes. I want to be an eyewitness.

621
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:27,074
I want to see that man myself
and face him down.

622
00:48:27,107 --> 00:48:29,543
Can you afford the time, Miss Frost?

623
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:33,347
Any time it requires.
This I intend to make my case in point.

624
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,215
You'll go to the General?

625
00:48:35,282 --> 00:48:39,486
I will, and to the War Department
and to the President.

626
00:48:40,354 --> 00:48:43,624
And if that doesn't do it,
I'll see Gabriel Heater.

627
00:48:56,003 --> 00:48:59,506
It's well after curfew.
I wonder if he's coming tonight.

628
00:48:59,573 --> 00:49:02,409
- He'll be here.
- Yeah?

629
00:49:02,443 --> 00:49:05,846
I don't think you understand
about arrangements like this.

630
00:49:05,913 --> 00:49:08,582
They work 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.

631
00:49:08,649 --> 00:49:10,684
Does the CIO know about this?

632
00:49:13,987 --> 00:49:17,257
Are you sure there aren't
any back stairs to that apartment?

633
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:18,959
There isn't even any back wall.

634
00:49:19,026 --> 00:49:22,196
She must be waiting for somebody.
Why leave the lights on?

635
00:49:22,262 --> 00:49:25,432
Maybe she's knitting
or putting up pickled peaches.

636
00:49:26,066 --> 00:49:28,135
Only we know better.

637
00:49:32,906 --> 00:49:34,975
Pickled peaches.

638
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:39,880
I bet you miss Iowa. I do already.

639
00:49:41,381 --> 00:49:44,651
- It's changed since you've been there.
- Yeah?

640
00:49:44,718 --> 00:49:47,721
A lot has happened, especially in Murdoch.

641
00:49:47,754 --> 00:49:50,624
- Do you remember Union Street?
- Mm-hm.

642
00:49:50,691 --> 00:49:55,329
Well, they've changed the name.
Now it's called Iwo Jima Boulevard.

643
00:49:55,362 --> 00:49:58,632
- That's news.
- And there was a post office scandal.

644
00:49:58,699 --> 00:50:02,469
- Yeah?
- About the new mural in the post office.

645
00:50:02,503 --> 00:50:05,205
The town collected $2,000 to hire a painter.

646
00:50:05,239 --> 00:50:08,509
The mayor got his cousin
from Chicago to do it.

647
00:50:08,542 --> 00:50:10,844
- That's nice.
- It was 80 feet long.

648
00:50:10,878 --> 00:50:12,846
Supposed to be Custer's last stand.

649
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,650
After the cousin left town,
they found out it wasn't an original.

650
00:50:16,683 --> 00:50:19,453
He copied the whole thing from a beer ad.

651
00:50:19,486 --> 00:50:20,988
Hm.

652
00:50:21,021 --> 00:50:25,559
- There was an awful lot of trouble.
- You take Iowa seriously, don't you?

653
00:50:25,592 --> 00:50:28,028
Yes, I guess I do. I like it. Don't you?

654
00:50:28,095 --> 00:50:29,563
Mm-hm.

655
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:33,200
We won a lot of honours last year,
all the 4H prizes.

656
00:50:33,267 --> 00:50:34,902
It's getting a little chilly.

657
00:50:34,968 --> 00:50:38,505
We had the lowest juvenile delinquency rate
until two months ago.

658
00:50:38,539 --> 00:50:39,640
What happened?

659
00:50:39,673 --> 00:50:42,943
A boy in Des Moines took
a blowtorch to his grandmother.

660
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:46,313
We fell clear down to 16th place.
It was humiliating.

661
00:50:57,991 --> 00:50:59,693
What's that?

662
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,596
- Crickets.
- Something dropped.

663
00:51:02,629 --> 00:51:05,299
- How's that?
- Something metallic.

664
00:51:05,332 --> 00:51:07,201
Metallic?

665
00:51:12,806 --> 00:51:14,708
Look, it's a key.

666
00:51:14,775 --> 00:51:17,077
A key? Whatever for?

667
00:51:17,111 --> 00:51:20,380
Evidently the man honks the horn
and that's the signal.

668
00:51:20,414 --> 00:51:22,883
You know more about
these things than I do.

669
00:51:22,916 --> 00:51:24,985
Johnny? Johnny?

670
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:32,059
Where are you, Johnny?

671
00:51:32,893 --> 00:51:34,394
Johnny?

672
00:51:38,165 --> 00:51:41,468
- Johnny.
- There are a lot of Johnnys in the army.

673
00:51:41,502 --> 00:51:43,804
- Now we're getting someplace.
- Where?

674
00:51:43,837 --> 00:51:47,141
This eliminates all the Jims,
the Bobs and the Georges.

675
00:51:47,241 --> 00:51:49,309
Too bad his name isn't Zachary.

676
00:51:49,343 --> 00:51:51,411
Yes, that would simplify it.

677
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:07,895
Johnny.

678
00:52:10,798 --> 00:52:14,001
I... don't know who you refer to.

679
00:52:14,034 --> 00:52:15,702
I am Captain Pringle

680
00:52:15,736 --> 00:52:20,040
and I have with me a member
of the Congress of the United States.

681
00:52:21,108 --> 00:52:22,943
Good evening.

682
00:52:22,976 --> 00:52:25,946
- You are Erika von Schlьtow?
- I am.

683
00:52:25,979 --> 00:52:29,783
We have reason to believe you're
consorting with a member of our army.

684
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:33,420
- You have?
- We think you're expecting him now.

685
00:52:34,288 --> 00:52:37,524
- What gives you that idea?
- The key you dropped.

686
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:43,263
- Maybe I dropped it for the milkman.
- Oh.

687
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:44,998
She dropped it for the milkman.

688
00:52:45,799 --> 00:52:49,736
Frдulein, if that's supposed to be a joke,
you're joking up the wrong tree.

689
00:52:49,803 --> 00:52:52,773
Let me assure you,
we are in no mood for flippancy.

690
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,542
- Facts, if you please.
- Yes, facts.

691
00:52:57,478 --> 00:53:00,581
- You are an American woman?
- We'll ask the questions.

692
00:53:00,614 --> 00:53:03,050
- What is the name of the man?
- Yes.

693
00:53:03,117 --> 00:53:05,385
- Johnny.
- Johnny what?

694
00:53:05,419 --> 00:53:08,088
I see you do not believe in lipstick.

695
00:53:08,155 --> 00:53:11,925
And what a curious way to do your hair,
or rather not to do it.

696
00:53:11,992 --> 00:53:14,728
Wait a minute.
Do you know who you're taking to?

697
00:53:14,762 --> 00:53:19,399
An American woman, and I'm a little
disappointed, to tell you the truth.

698
00:53:19,433 --> 00:53:23,270
We apparently have a false idea
about the chic American woman.

699
00:53:23,303 --> 00:53:28,242
- I suppose it's publicity from Hollywood.
- You're being impertinent.

700
00:53:28,275 --> 00:53:32,579
Well, I must go back now. There's
a curfew for German civilians, you know.

701
00:53:32,613 --> 00:53:34,448
There sure is.

702
00:53:34,481 --> 00:53:38,018
Frдulein von Schlьtow,
we increased our national debt

703
00:53:38,118 --> 00:53:43,791
by some $350 billion to win this war.
I would regard it as a waste

704
00:53:43,857 --> 00:53:47,361
- if we didn't eliminate types like you.
- Like you.

705
00:53:51,665 --> 00:53:56,303
Perhaps if you would change
the line of your eyebrows a little.

706
00:53:56,370 --> 00:53:58,472
Gute Nacht.

707
00:53:58,505 --> 00:54:01,775
Gute Nacht,
Captain... whatever your name is.

708
00:54:06,413 --> 00:54:09,516
What nerve. What colossal nerve.

709
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:12,820
We have to remember what
they've been through.

710
00:54:12,853 --> 00:54:16,023
All those bombings left them
kind of wobbly up here.

711
00:54:16,089 --> 00:54:18,959
- I do look awful without make-up.
- You don't.

712
00:54:18,992 --> 00:54:22,162
We were only allowed 60lbs of luggage.
No nonessentials.

713
00:54:22,229 --> 00:54:26,800
Never listen to another woman if you want
to know how you look. Ask a man.

714
00:54:26,834 --> 00:54:29,303
- Come on, ask me.
- I know how I look.

715
00:54:29,336 --> 00:54:33,974
You look charming, positively,
definitely, absolutely charming...

716
00:54:33,974 --> 00:54:36,477
in a... refreshing sort of way.

717
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:39,213
- Are you being polite?
- Who wants perfume?

718
00:54:39,246 --> 00:54:43,884
Give me the fresh wet smell
of Iowa corn right after it rains.

719
00:54:43,917 --> 00:54:46,887
We had little rain this year,
wonderful corn weather.

720
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,989
I'm sure glad to hear that.

721
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:52,593
- Now to get back to that woman.
- Must we?

722
00:54:52,659 --> 00:54:55,629
To be as insulting as that,
she must feel awfully safe.

723
00:54:55,729 --> 00:54:57,364
Or just bluffing.

724
00:54:57,397 --> 00:55:00,667
The man behind her
must be really important.

725
00:55:00,701 --> 00:55:03,036
A general or a colonel.

726
00:55:03,103 --> 00:55:05,139
A colonel at least.

727
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,309
What's the full name of that colonel?

728
00:55:09,343 --> 00:55:12,012
- Colonel?
- That Colonel Plummer.

729
00:55:12,045 --> 00:55:13,914
- Rufus J Plummer.
- J for what?

730
00:55:13,947 --> 00:55:15,983
J for John.

731
00:55:16,083 --> 00:55:17,651
Do you think?

732
00:55:17,684 --> 00:55:21,989
No, not him. It couldn't be him.
He's a married man. A West Pointer.

733
00:55:22,022 --> 00:55:24,658
I've heard of married men,
of West Pointers, even.

734
00:55:24,725 --> 00:55:28,962
- But not Plummer, ma'am, I swear.
- There was a look in his eye.

735
00:55:29,062 --> 00:55:33,000
If we could only get our hands on her file.
Who told you it was sent to Nьrnberg?

736
00:55:33,033 --> 00:55:37,638
- Second Lieutenant Cook, in charge of files.
- Maybe he's covering up for his colonel.

737
00:55:37,704 --> 00:55:41,508
- I'll ask him tomorrow morning.
- No. We'll go there now.

738
00:55:41,575 --> 00:55:43,210
- Where?
- To the files.

739
00:55:43,277 --> 00:55:46,180
In the middle of the night?
Shouldn't we get permission?

740
00:55:46,246 --> 00:55:49,783
Did we get permission
to land in Normandy? Let's go.

741
00:56:03,964 --> 00:56:06,834
Schlьtow, Schlьtow.

742
00:56:06,867 --> 00:56:08,969
S... SA...

743
00:56:12,973 --> 00:56:15,843
SCH to ST. This is where it would be.

744
00:56:15,876 --> 00:56:17,778
If it is at all, but I don't think it is.

745
00:56:17,811 --> 00:56:20,481
- Well, let's make good and sure.
- Sure.

746
00:56:22,049 --> 00:56:24,518
Come on, open it.

747
00:56:24,551 --> 00:56:28,255
Schlage, Schlangenberg,
Schlagenspitz, Schlitz...

748
00:56:28,322 --> 00:56:31,658
Seems that some of them
never got to Milwaukee.

749
00:56:32,526 --> 00:56:35,362
Schliemann, Schlьssel, Schlьtow...

750
00:56:35,429 --> 00:56:37,498
- There.
- Here's the Schlьtows.

751
00:56:37,531 --> 00:56:43,370
Anton, Emil, Fritz, Gottfried, Waldemar...

752
00:56:43,403 --> 00:56:45,472
- No Erika.
- No Erika.

753
00:56:45,506 --> 00:56:48,709
Told you so. Gone to Nьrnberg.
Gone to Nьrnberg.

754
00:56:48,776 --> 00:56:51,044
I'll take you back to your billet.

755
00:56:52,012 --> 00:56:54,047
Erika von Schlьtow.

756
00:56:54,081 --> 00:56:55,916
- Yes?
- It's under von.

757
00:56:55,949 --> 00:56:57,451
Oh, no.

758
00:56:57,484 --> 00:57:01,054
Like O'Brien. You wouldn't
look under B, you'd look under O.

759
00:57:01,121 --> 00:57:03,957
- All right, let's look under O.
- Under V.

760
00:57:06,727 --> 00:57:10,063
- V as in vindictive.
- What was that, Captain?

761
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:12,199
I pity anybody who has you on his trail.

762
00:57:12,266 --> 00:57:15,569
You pity a man who's consorting
with a notorious Nazi?

763
00:57:15,636 --> 00:57:17,271
Von Resnicek, von Reudesheim...

764
00:57:17,304 --> 00:57:20,574
Did it occur to you there might be
extenuating circumstances?

765
00:57:20,641 --> 00:57:23,143
I expect any man in his country's uniform...

766
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:26,814
Oh, that one.
You expect him to be an ambassador.

767
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,651
A salesman of goodwill. You want him
to stand on the blackened rubble

768
00:57:30,684 --> 00:57:32,953
of what used to be the corner of a street

769
00:57:32,986 --> 00:57:35,289
with a sample case of assorted freedoms,

770
00:57:35,322 --> 00:57:37,524
waving the flag and the Bill of Rights.

771
00:57:37,558 --> 00:57:39,960
That's not the way it works.

772
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:43,797
Suppose you stop and ask yourself
how come he skidded of the road?

773
00:57:43,864 --> 00:57:48,102
- I'll tell you how. No moral brakes.
- That's it, going too fast.

774
00:57:48,202 --> 00:57:50,604
During the war, he couldn't go fast enough.

775
00:57:50,637 --> 00:57:55,409
"Get on that beachhead, through the
tank traps, across the Rhine. Step on it."

776
00:57:55,476 --> 00:58:01,048
Faster, 100 miles an hour,
24 hours a day through burning towns.

777
00:58:01,081 --> 00:58:02,983
Then one day the war is over.

778
00:58:03,016 --> 00:58:06,120
You expect him to jam on those brakes
and stop like that.

779
00:58:06,153 --> 00:58:08,255
Everybody can't stop like that!

780
00:58:08,288 --> 00:58:12,626
Sometimes you skid, sometimes you go
into a spin and smash into a tree

781
00:58:12,659 --> 00:58:17,731
and bash your fenders and scrape those
fine ideals you brought from home.

782
00:58:17,765 --> 00:58:20,400
It's time such wrecks
were hauled into a garage.

783
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,404
- Anyone who forgets he's American...
- Don't forget he's also human.

784
00:58:24,471 --> 00:58:26,573
What would you know about that?

785
00:58:28,442 --> 00:58:29,877
Von Schlegel, von Schlittenheim...

786
00:58:30,077 --> 00:58:34,581
The loneliness is stored up right down
to his boots and it's driving him crazy.

787
00:58:34,648 --> 00:58:37,584
One day a pair of
open-toed shoes come along.

788
00:58:37,618 --> 00:58:41,955
You want him to ask questions?
Party affiliation? Social Security number?

789
00:58:42,022 --> 00:58:45,492
Yes, I want him to make sure
he's not doing something subversive.

790
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:49,830
Are you qualified to call the pitch on this?
What's your life, anyway?

791
00:58:49,863 --> 00:58:52,633
Committees and sessions
and adjournments

792
00:58:52,666 --> 00:58:54,735
and budget cuts and appropriations.

793
00:58:54,802 --> 00:58:58,605
What do you do for laughs? What do you
do for tears for that matter?

794
00:59:00,774 --> 00:59:05,045
For tears... for tears I cry, Captain Pringle.

795
00:59:05,078 --> 00:59:07,347
It may interest you to know
I once cried for a man

796
00:59:07,381 --> 00:59:09,550
till my eyes were
half washed out of my head.

797
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:11,785
Not really.

798
00:59:11,819 --> 00:59:16,590
I was on an important subcommittee.
One was a Southern Democrat.

799
00:59:16,623 --> 00:59:19,593
His convictions
were utterly different from mine.

800
00:59:19,626 --> 00:59:23,964
I hated everything he stood for.
I despised his politics.

801
00:59:23,997 --> 00:59:26,834
But I loved him... insanely.

802
00:59:28,035 --> 00:59:30,771
I loved the Southern syrup in his voice.

803
00:59:31,605 --> 00:59:34,007
His mint julep manners.

804
00:59:34,108 --> 00:59:37,644
The way he'd look at me
through his long thick eyelashes

805
00:59:37,711 --> 00:59:40,013
when I was vetoing an amendment.

806
00:59:41,348 --> 00:59:45,953
He'd put his arm around me,
just kind of lazy, like.

807
00:59:47,387 --> 00:59:50,157
Lean his head against my cheek.

808
00:59:50,224 --> 00:59:53,761
His hair had a deep wave in it.

809
00:59:54,795 --> 00:59:58,465
- You know what he was trying to do?
- What?

810
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:01,568
He was trying to sway my vote.

811
01:00:04,138 --> 01:00:07,441
Once he drove me home
from an all-night meeting,

812
01:00:07,508 --> 01:00:09,777
stopped his car on Earl Street.

813
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:14,081
For no reason at all, he said,
except he was yearning for my lips.

814
01:00:15,549 --> 01:00:18,619
To tell you the truth, I was yearning for his.

815
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:23,724
But it would have meant betraying
my platform and my constituents.

816
01:00:23,757 --> 01:00:26,026
- What did you do?
- I filibustered.

817
01:00:26,059 --> 01:00:28,529
- You what?
- I just kept on talking.

818
01:00:28,562 --> 01:00:33,634
The constitution, the Bill of Rights, poems,
Longfellow, anything I could think of.

819
01:00:33,667 --> 01:00:37,971
Von Schloss, von Schlotzing,
von Schlumann, von Schlьrmann,

820
01:00:38,005 --> 01:00:39,873
von...

821
01:00:42,776 --> 01:00:45,813
- No other man since the mint julep guy?
- No.

822
01:00:45,879 --> 01:00:48,582
- No more what you call yearning?
- No.

823
01:00:50,284 --> 01:00:52,953
- Sure?
- None of your business.

824
01:00:54,388 --> 01:00:59,126
I've been doing a little yearning
ever since you stepped off that plane.

825
01:01:00,127 --> 01:01:02,229
Captain Pringle!

826
01:01:03,697 --> 01:01:06,733
- Don't!
- Why not? You're not a Nazi.

827
01:01:06,767 --> 01:01:10,070
Don't tell me it's subversive
to kiss a Republican.

828
01:01:15,209 --> 01:01:17,077
I am a Congresswoman.

829
01:01:17,111 --> 01:01:21,081
Yeah. Now I know how I'll cast
my absentee ballot come re-election.

830
01:01:21,148 --> 01:01:24,918
- I'm here on official business.
- This is official.

831
01:01:24,985 --> 01:01:27,788
Oh! Now, listen.

832
01:01:27,821 --> 01:01:29,723
Listen.

833
01:01:29,823 --> 01:01:34,128
"Listen, my children, and you shall hear
of the midnight ride of Paul Revere

834
01:01:34,161 --> 01:01:38,065
"On the 18th of April in '75,
hardly a man is now alive

835
01:01:38,132 --> 01:01:40,868
"Who remembers that famous day and year

836
01:01:41,635 --> 01:01:46,073
"He said to his friend, 'lf the British march
by land or sea from the town tonight

837
01:01:46,106 --> 01:01:51,111
"'Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch
of the North Church tower as a signal light

838
01:01:51,211 --> 01:01:53,614
"'One if by land and two if by sea

839
01:01:53,647 --> 01:01:57,851
"'And I on the opposite shore shall be
ready to ride and spread the alarm

840
01:01:57,918 --> 01:02:00,354
"'Through every Middlesex village and farm

841
01:02:00,387 --> 01:02:03,190
"'For the country folk to be up and to arm... '

842
01:02:04,792 --> 01:02:10,264
"Then he said 'Good night! '
and, with muffled oar, silent..." Oh!

843
01:02:14,635 --> 01:02:17,671
Now, Congresswoman,
may I have the floor?

844
01:02:19,206 --> 01:02:21,275
You are entirely out of order.

845
01:02:21,341 --> 01:02:23,377
Objection overruled.

846
01:02:46,133 --> 01:02:48,335
Ooh. Oh.

847
01:02:48,402 --> 01:02:50,838
Just, er, checking up on Paul Revere.

848
01:02:52,272 --> 01:02:55,476
Oh, sure.

849
01:03:57,271 --> 01:04:01,008
This is where you live, Congresswoman.
This is your billet.

850
01:04:02,810 --> 01:04:05,779
I said we're here. What's the matter?

851
01:04:07,614 --> 01:04:10,951
- I just want to die.
- You what?

852
01:04:10,984 --> 01:04:13,654
It's awful. It never should have happened.

853
01:04:13,687 --> 01:04:16,723
Listen, you didn't burn down an orphanage.

854
01:04:16,757 --> 01:04:19,226
You got kissed in a file room. That's all.

855
01:04:19,293 --> 01:04:21,595
- I'm a thief.
- Thief?

856
01:04:21,628 --> 01:04:24,898
The lowest kind of a thief,
stealing another woman's man.

857
01:04:25,732 --> 01:04:26,767
Yeah?

858
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:29,269
The cake I brought. The girl you left behind.

859
01:04:29,303 --> 01:04:32,306
She sent a love letter and you fell in love
with the postman.

860
01:04:32,339 --> 01:04:36,110
Those things happen, like electrons,
positive and negative.

861
01:04:36,143 --> 01:04:39,446
- One day they get together and wham!
- No!

862
01:04:39,513 --> 01:04:41,215
No wham.

863
01:04:41,248 --> 01:04:44,418
- We've got to get control of ourselves.
- Can we?

864
01:04:44,451 --> 01:04:46,887
It would be wiser
not to see each other again.

865
01:04:46,954 --> 01:04:51,125
- I suppose it would.
- We can't go on with our investigation.

866
01:04:51,158 --> 01:04:54,461
- So we drop it.
- No. No, I'll go on alone.

867
01:04:55,496 --> 01:04:58,599
- I could enlist the help of the general.
- No.

868
01:04:58,665 --> 01:05:00,100
Why not?

869
01:05:00,134 --> 01:05:05,439
Miss Frost, Congresswoman,
Postman, darling,

870
01:05:05,472 --> 01:05:09,476
to know that you're here and around
and I couldn't see you, I'd go crazy.

871
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:11,145
We've got to be strong.

872
01:05:11,178 --> 01:05:15,883
This business about Dusty, it's not serious.
It's just a college crush.

873
01:05:15,983 --> 01:05:19,286
- I have a dreadful sense of guilt.
- We're not engaged.

874
01:05:19,319 --> 01:05:22,089
I'm not committed in any way.

875
01:05:22,089 --> 01:05:27,261
It would break her heart, the daughter of
the man who swung the 4th Precinct.

876
01:05:27,294 --> 01:05:30,831
No, it won't.
She's a kind of a flighty kid, you know.

877
01:05:30,864 --> 01:05:33,867
She's been engaged to four guys
since I've been gone,

878
01:05:33,901 --> 01:05:36,370
one of them a feed and grain merchant.

879
01:05:36,437 --> 01:05:39,139
Think what a good provider he'd make.

880
01:05:39,173 --> 01:05:40,808
Oh, John...

881
01:05:41,608 --> 01:05:45,546
I don't even know your first name,
Congresswoman darling.

882
01:05:45,579 --> 01:05:47,681
- Phoebe.
- Phoebe.

883
01:05:47,781 --> 01:05:49,616
Isn't that ridiculous?

884
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:51,752
Not a bit ridiculous.

885
01:05:53,754 --> 01:05:56,490
How about a good-night kiss, Phoebe?

886
01:05:58,592 --> 01:06:00,661
Good night.

887
01:06:04,665 --> 01:06:06,733
Good morning.

888
01:06:10,804 --> 01:06:13,073
Good evening.

889
01:06:17,778 --> 01:06:19,880
Good gracious.

890
01:06:27,888 --> 01:06:33,660
The problem is how to stop
all this physical human contact...

891
01:06:36,997 --> 01:06:40,834
We just ought to put our foot down
and put it down hard.

892
01:06:40,934 --> 01:06:43,170
- Why, Miss Frost.
- Where have you been?

893
01:06:43,237 --> 01:06:46,173
- We've been worried.
- Won't you join us?

894
01:06:46,206 --> 01:06:48,075
- Miss Frost?
- Miss Frost?

895
01:07:15,803 --> 01:07:17,905
Anything I can do for you?

896
01:07:18,939 --> 01:07:21,008
Not a thing.

897
01:07:23,544 --> 01:07:27,548
Hah...

898
01:07:43,897 --> 01:07:48,969
- Hans Otto Birgel.
- That's the best we could find, Colonel.

899
01:07:49,002 --> 01:07:52,339
The others without uniform
don't show his face so plainly.

900
01:07:52,439 --> 01:07:56,376
Lovely master race type.
I bet he never tortured anybody.

901
01:07:56,410 --> 01:07:59,446
Not until he made sure
his dachshund had had his dinner.

902
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:01,982
I want every MP to memorise this puss.

903
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:10,324
Have 100 copies printed. Send it around
with a detailed description.

904
01:08:10,357 --> 01:08:11,592
Will do.

905
01:08:11,658 --> 01:08:14,428
We've got the trap baited
with the right cheese.

906
01:08:14,461 --> 01:08:16,730
He'll snap at it, sure as shooting.

907
01:08:17,898 --> 01:08:20,167
I hope.

908
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,636
Come in.

909
01:08:22,703 --> 01:08:25,372
- You wanted to see me, Colonel?
- Yes, Miss Frost.

910
01:08:25,405 --> 01:08:27,674
- That'll be all, Major.
- Yes, sir.

911
01:08:28,809 --> 01:08:31,245
- How is the investigation going?
- The what?

912
01:08:31,278 --> 01:08:33,580
- The investigation.
- Oh, fine.

913
01:08:33,647 --> 01:08:36,517
- Making any progress?
- Slowly. Why?

914
01:08:37,351 --> 01:08:40,187
It seems, in the course of it,
you lost something.

915
01:08:40,254 --> 01:08:42,689
- I have?
- This is yours, isn't it?

916
01:08:43,824 --> 01:08:48,061
Yes, thank you very much.
Well, I guess I'd better get some hatpins.

917
01:08:48,162 --> 01:08:51,865
It is pretty windy in Berlin,
especially at night.

918
01:08:54,535 --> 01:08:57,838
Well, the whole thing
can be easily explained.

919
01:09:03,744 --> 01:09:08,782
But I hardly think you're in a position
to cast a stone, Colonel Plummer.

920
01:09:08,816 --> 01:09:11,952
- I'm very sorry.
- I think you're brazen.

921
01:09:11,985 --> 01:09:13,187
Am I?

922
01:09:13,253 --> 01:09:16,957
- Having that on your desk.
- Having what on my desk?

923
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:21,562
I know all about that going
100 miles an hour, then the war is over

924
01:09:21,595 --> 01:09:23,864
but you can't stop like that.

925
01:09:23,897 --> 01:09:26,400
But there is such a thing as discretion.

926
01:09:27,234 --> 01:09:30,671
- What discretion?
- Is this your family?

927
01:09:30,704 --> 01:09:33,607
Yes, and this is our house in Indiana.

928
01:09:33,674 --> 01:09:36,143
- How long have you been married?
- 22 years.

929
01:09:36,210 --> 01:09:39,680
Oh, no. Perhaps it would be a good idea
if you sent for your wife.

930
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:42,216
She can't come now.
We're expecting a baby.

931
01:09:42,249 --> 01:09:45,219
- A baby?
- I mean, our older daughter is.

932
01:09:45,252 --> 01:09:50,023
I can understand the temptation of
a young man over here but a grandfather...

933
01:09:50,057 --> 01:09:54,027
Really, Colonel Plummer,
you should have your brakes relined.

934
01:10:15,682 --> 01:10:17,718
John. John, now I know.

935
01:10:17,785 --> 01:10:20,087
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

936
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:22,589
- I found out. There can't be any doubt.
- What?

937
01:10:22,623 --> 01:10:24,491
- He even has her picture.
- Who?

938
01:10:24,591 --> 01:10:26,093
- Colonel Plummer.
- Whose?

939
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:28,128
- That woman's.
- How come?

940
01:10:28,195 --> 01:10:30,230
I mean, what for?

941
01:10:30,297 --> 01:10:33,000
To look at. He can't keep his eyes off her.

942
01:10:33,033 --> 01:10:36,537
It must be a mistake.
Maybe it's somebody who looks like her.

943
01:10:36,603 --> 01:10:38,639
Should I talk it over with the general?

944
01:10:38,705 --> 01:10:41,675
I wouldn't. Not the general.

945
01:10:41,742 --> 01:10:46,013
Excuse me. Denazification office,
Captain Pringle speaking.

946
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:50,184
- Who?
- Johnny, what has happened?

947
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:53,554
Why didn't you come last night?
I waited for you.

948
01:10:53,587 --> 01:10:55,856
Johnny, are you listening?

949
01:10:55,923 --> 01:11:01,261
Of course I am, Lieutenant... Forrestal.

950
01:11:01,295 --> 01:11:03,564
Lieutenant Forrestal, quartermasters.

951
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:08,302
Well, Lieutenant, I'm sorry I couldn't
make it. I'm pretty busy these days.

952
01:11:08,368 --> 01:11:14,007
Johnny, what's the matter?
This is Erika. How you talk to me!

953
01:11:14,074 --> 01:11:18,178
Lieutenant, it should not be
too difficult to grasp the situation.

954
01:11:18,278 --> 01:11:20,714
I wonder how he got through officers school.

955
01:11:21,915 --> 01:11:23,951
Oh, someone is with you, is that it?

956
01:11:24,017 --> 01:11:26,286
That is correct, Lieutenant Forrestal.

957
01:11:26,353 --> 01:11:29,857
Is this the son of the secretary of the Navy?
Let me speak with him.

958
01:11:29,923 --> 01:11:33,827
No, this is the army Forrestal,
absolutely no relation.

959
01:11:34,661 --> 01:11:38,632
Lieutenant, I assure you
I'll see you as soon as it's practical.

960
01:11:38,699 --> 01:11:41,635
It may be late,
possibly after your office hours.

961
01:11:42,503 --> 01:11:47,574
- I miss you so, Johnny. I love you.
- I'll make a note of that.

962
01:11:47,608 --> 01:11:49,710
Goodbye, Lieutenant.

963
01:11:49,777 --> 01:11:53,013
Nice kid. We went through
basic training together.

964
01:11:54,648 --> 01:11:56,750
Now, what am I to do about the Colonel?

965
01:11:56,817 --> 01:12:00,587
- I don't know.
- Could he be transferred to Japan?

966
01:12:00,621 --> 01:12:04,591
I don't think so, not Japan.
Not with Tokyo Rose around.

967
01:12:04,658 --> 01:12:07,694
- What do you suggest?
- What do I suggest?

968
01:12:07,761 --> 01:12:10,664
- What do I suggest? Come on!
- Where are you taking me?

969
01:12:10,697 --> 01:12:13,367
Brent, take over for me.
I won't be back today.

970
01:12:13,434 --> 01:12:16,570
Where are you taking me?
We have a meeting with the general.

971
01:12:16,637 --> 01:12:20,407
You don't want to see the general,
you want to see me. I want to see you.

972
01:12:20,441 --> 01:12:23,710
So little time, so much to say.
Don't let's waste a minute.

973
01:12:23,744 --> 01:12:26,713
- My investigation...
- I'll handle it after you go.

974
01:12:26,713 --> 01:12:29,383
Send you a full report to Washington.

975
01:12:29,450 --> 01:12:32,753
These few days are ours.
They're all we've got.

976
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:34,621
You dreadful man.

977
01:12:34,655 --> 01:12:37,491
Come on. Let's get the Jeep
and drive out to Wannsee.

978
01:12:37,524 --> 01:12:42,830
It's wide and green and I know a spot
that looks like a bend in the Mississippi.

979
01:12:42,863 --> 01:12:44,531
Let's.

980
01:13:02,349 --> 01:13:05,185
Johnny, come on.

981
01:13:05,219 --> 01:13:07,955
- Faster. Faster.
- Hi.

982
01:13:07,988 --> 01:13:12,760
Two days and two nights, what has
mein kleiner Liebling being doing?

983
01:13:13,761 --> 01:13:16,697
He's been making charm
with the bloodhounds.

984
01:13:16,764 --> 01:13:19,066
How are things going
with the Congresswoman?

985
01:13:19,099 --> 01:13:22,102
- All right. We're engaged.
- You're what?

986
01:13:22,136 --> 01:13:24,605
Better than having my head chopped off.

987
01:13:24,671 --> 01:13:28,675
- I didn't know you were that deep in.
- What deep? How deep?

988
01:13:28,742 --> 01:13:31,612
Why didn't you tell me
you and Birgel were like that?

989
01:13:31,678 --> 01:13:34,415
- He's dead.
- Having your hand kissed by Hitler.

990
01:13:34,448 --> 01:13:36,283
I hope you had it sterilised.

991
01:13:36,383 --> 01:13:39,153
Looked as if he had rat poison
in that moustache.

992
01:13:39,186 --> 01:13:41,021
Don't talk like that.

993
01:13:41,855 --> 01:13:45,626
Why not?
How much of a Nazi were you, anyway?

994
01:13:45,659 --> 01:13:48,929
Johnny, what does it matter,
a woman's politics?

995
01:13:48,996 --> 01:13:53,300
Women pick out whatever's in fashion
and change it like a spring hat.

996
01:13:53,333 --> 01:13:58,405
Yeah. Last year it was
a little number with a swastika on it.

997
01:13:58,405 --> 01:14:02,376
This year it's ostrich feathers,
red, white and blue.

998
01:14:02,443 --> 01:14:04,912
Next year a hammer, maybe, and a sickle.

999
01:14:05,712 --> 01:14:09,950
Oh, Johnny, we must not say
mean words to each other.

1000
01:14:10,951 --> 01:14:15,222
When you say you are engaged,
that is only until her plane leaves, huh?

1001
01:14:15,289 --> 01:14:17,357
What else?

1002
01:14:17,391 --> 01:14:19,860
- I love you so very much.
- You do?

1003
01:14:19,893 --> 01:14:22,729
You're the only man I ever wanted to marry.

1004
01:14:24,998 --> 01:14:27,101
That's mighty white of you.

1005
01:14:27,901 --> 01:14:32,706
I want to go with you to America.
I want to climb up the Statue of Liberty.

1006
01:14:32,773 --> 01:14:35,976
You want to get down
that basement at Fort Knox.

1007
01:14:36,009 --> 01:14:38,479
I want to be where you are.

1008
01:14:38,512 --> 01:14:42,816
Yeah, I can just imagine you
in Iowa in blue jeans,

1009
01:14:42,850 --> 01:14:45,119
going on a hay ride to the old mill.

1010
01:14:45,185 --> 01:14:47,221
I would love that.

1011
01:14:48,522 --> 01:14:51,658
Mmm, gently, baby, it's Mother's Day.

1012
01:14:53,127 --> 01:14:55,529
Cut it out, you blonde flamethrower.

1013
01:14:56,497 --> 01:14:57,965
Cut it out, I said.

1014
01:15:02,636 --> 01:15:05,305
Did you ever kiss the Congresswoman?

1015
01:15:05,339 --> 01:15:07,241
Sure I did.

1016
01:15:08,142 --> 01:15:11,678
- Did she kiss you?
- What kind of a question is that?

1017
01:15:11,712 --> 01:15:16,750
It's a very important question. What
do you do when you're alone together?

1018
01:15:16,784 --> 01:15:22,122
Oh... we sit, hold hands...

1019
01:15:23,590 --> 01:15:27,227
whistle Shine On Harvest Moon.

1020
01:15:27,261 --> 01:15:29,930
- What's so funny?
- You hold hands?

1021
01:15:29,963 --> 01:15:32,066
Sure. Nice people do, you know.

1022
01:15:34,134 --> 01:15:37,271
You're so naive, you Americans.

1023
01:15:37,337 --> 01:15:39,640
So we are. So what of it?

1024
01:15:39,673 --> 01:15:44,711
That funny little woman with a face
like a scrubbed kitchen floor.

1025
01:15:44,745 --> 01:15:46,580
Yeah?

1026
01:15:50,517 --> 01:15:54,455
I have some vodka from the Russian sector
and I had the phonograph fixed.

1027
01:15:54,555 --> 01:15:57,357
- Would you like to hear some music?
- No thanks.

1028
01:15:57,391 --> 01:16:00,027
- Thanks a lot but no thanks.
- You're going?

1029
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:04,264
- I got an early formation.
- You'll come back tomorrow night?

1030
01:16:04,298 --> 01:16:07,201
I imagine so, sterling character that I am.

1031
01:16:08,135 --> 01:16:09,970
So long.

1032
01:16:27,221 --> 01:16:29,957
- Miss Frost?
- Miss Frost?

1033
01:16:31,024 --> 01:16:34,294
- We're waiting for you.
- Dinner, Miss Frost.

1034
01:16:34,328 --> 01:16:37,030
- Did you call me?
- It's a quarter of eight.

1035
01:16:37,064 --> 01:16:39,700
We're going to the officers' mess for dinner.

1036
01:16:39,733 --> 01:16:42,603
I was sort of planning on a quiet evening.

1037
01:16:42,636 --> 01:16:44,471
Don't you feel well, Miss Frost?

1038
01:16:44,505 --> 01:16:47,808
I feel fine.
I have a kind of a headache, that's all.

1039
01:16:47,841 --> 01:16:50,110
Would you make
my excuses to the colonel?

1040
01:16:50,144 --> 01:16:53,113
- Sure will.
- Shall we bring you a sandwich maybe?

1041
01:16:53,147 --> 01:16:55,215
Cheese? Chicken? Ham?

1042
01:16:55,249 --> 01:16:59,319
Anything. Thank you very much.
Good evening, gentlemen.

1043
01:16:59,353 --> 01:17:01,388
Maybe we shouldn't leave her alone.

1044
01:17:01,455 --> 01:17:05,659
Maybe we should take her temperature.
Quite a lot of typhoid fever in Berlin.

1045
01:17:09,596 --> 01:17:12,966
Oh, good evening. I came to see Miss Frost.

1046
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,069
Go on in. We're going out.

1047
01:17:16,270 --> 01:17:19,306
One might suspect
Cupid had a hand in this.

1048
01:17:19,339 --> 01:17:23,310
If we didn't know Miss Frost.
You can't shoot an arrow through steel.

1049
01:17:24,478 --> 01:17:26,880
Phoebe... Phoebe!

1050
01:17:36,356 --> 01:17:38,392
Coming, John.

1051
01:18:05,219 --> 01:18:07,121
Well!

1052
01:18:09,723 --> 01:18:12,559
- Do I look all right?
- Where did you get it?

1053
01:18:12,593 --> 01:18:16,397
- At the Brandenburg Gate.
- The black market? You didn't.

1054
01:18:16,397 --> 01:18:20,701
Well, I did. All I wanted was a lipstick
and something for my eyebrows

1055
01:18:20,734 --> 01:18:23,871
but a woman had this over
the handlebars of her bicycle

1056
01:18:23,904 --> 01:18:26,407
and I gave her my typewriter for it.

1057
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:29,076
The shoes were six extra typewriter ribbons.

1058
01:18:29,109 --> 01:18:31,812
- Phoebe, for the love of Mike.
- Don't scold me.

1059
01:18:31,845 --> 01:18:34,314
I know I shouldn't have but I simply had to.

1060
01:18:34,348 --> 01:18:39,420
This is our last evening and I wanted
to look so pretty and I look just awful.

1061
01:18:39,453 --> 01:18:44,458
It's like a circus tent in mourning
for an elephant that died.

1062
01:18:44,525 --> 01:18:47,361
- It's no such thing.
- I'm not blind.

1063
01:18:47,394 --> 01:18:51,331
I tried to fix it but maybe
I'd better go up and put my suit on.

1064
01:18:52,199 --> 01:18:56,470
It is kind of high. What is it,
a turtleneck evening gown?

1065
01:18:56,503 --> 01:19:00,641
Well, it was a little lower but I fixed it.

1066
01:19:00,741 --> 01:19:02,776
You sure did.

1067
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:07,047
Now, we takes this pin from here,
where it's just in the way,

1068
01:19:07,114 --> 01:19:10,217
and put it back here
where it can earn its pay.

1069
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:12,319
It looked so lovely on the bicycle.

1070
01:19:12,352 --> 01:19:16,323
Now, stop it. You dressed for me
and to me you look good.

1071
01:19:16,390 --> 01:19:20,127
John, where did you learn
so much about women's clothes?

1072
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:22,663
My mother wore women's clothes.

1073
01:19:22,696 --> 01:19:27,101
Oh, John, you're simply adorable.
Do you know it?

1074
01:19:27,201 --> 01:19:29,937
Who am I to argue with a Congresswoman?

1075
01:19:30,003 --> 01:19:32,239
You've got too much junk on your mouth.

1076
01:19:32,306 --> 01:19:34,374
- Have I?
- Now, hold still.

1077
01:19:36,777 --> 01:19:38,846
Now... we're in business.

1078
01:19:40,948 --> 01:19:42,983
We forgot your sable.

1079
01:19:43,016 --> 01:19:44,451
Oh...

1080
01:19:47,721 --> 01:19:50,791
You'll be quite a thing at that officers' mess.

1081
01:19:50,824 --> 01:19:53,961
- I don't want to go there.
- Where do you want to eat?

1082
01:19:53,994 --> 01:19:56,063
I thought some civilian place.

1083
01:19:56,096 --> 01:19:57,598
In Berlin?

1084
01:19:57,631 --> 01:20:01,568
The place where that singer...
You know, that place.

1085
01:20:01,635 --> 01:20:04,104
- You don't want to go to that sewer.
- Yes, I do.

1086
01:20:04,138 --> 01:20:06,840
I want it dark and gay and with music.

1087
01:20:07,674 --> 01:20:13,514
Want to buy some illusions slightly used?

1088
01:20:13,547 --> 01:20:15,649
Second-hand

1089
01:20:16,717 --> 01:20:22,322
They were lovely illusions, reaching high

1090
01:20:22,356 --> 01:20:24,825
Built on sand

1091
01:20:25,893 --> 01:20:30,164
They had a touch of paradise

1092
01:20:30,197 --> 01:20:34,535
A spell you can't explain

1093
01:20:35,536 --> 01:20:39,807
For in this crazy paradise

1094
01:20:39,873 --> 01:20:44,144
You are in love with pain

1095
01:20:45,712 --> 01:20:51,785
Want to buy some illusions slightly used?

1096
01:20:51,819 --> 01:20:53,954
Just like new

1097
01:20:55,856 --> 01:20:59,760
Such romantic illusions

1098
01:20:59,827 --> 01:21:04,131
And they're all about you

1099
01:21:05,532 --> 01:21:10,237
I'd sell them all for a penny

1100
01:21:10,270 --> 01:21:14,508
They make pretty souvenirs

1101
01:21:16,043 --> 01:21:20,013
Take my lovely illusions

1102
01:21:20,047 --> 01:21:22,516
Some for laughs

1103
01:21:23,817 --> 01:21:28,856
Some for tears

1104
01:21:35,763 --> 01:21:39,333
- Look, it's a hollow bottle.
- That's where the profit is.

1105
01:21:39,366 --> 01:21:42,035
There should be
a Congressional investigation.

1106
01:21:42,069 --> 01:21:45,639
- Second the motion.
- Let's investigate another bottle first.

1107
01:21:45,672 --> 01:21:47,674
- More champagne.
- Jawohl.

1108
01:21:48,509 --> 01:21:50,511
Hold my hand, John.

1109
01:21:51,845 --> 01:21:53,747
Sure.

1110
01:21:54,782 --> 01:21:57,117
Oh, John...

1111
01:21:57,151 --> 01:21:59,219
I'm so happy, I'm in heaven.

1112
01:22:00,454 --> 01:22:02,656
Not that I was unhappy before.

1113
01:22:02,689 --> 01:22:04,625
I was just drifting.

1114
01:22:04,691 --> 01:22:08,695
That's it. Drifting on a grey sea all alone.

1115
01:22:08,796 --> 01:22:11,198
It's not bad but suddenly you get scared.

1116
01:22:11,231 --> 01:22:16,070
You need another voice,
so you hoist up your heart and you wait

1117
01:22:16,170 --> 01:22:19,440
and nobody passes by, just grey waves.

1118
01:22:19,473 --> 01:22:24,078
Your heart gets frayed,
lashed by the night winds and rain.

1119
01:22:24,111 --> 01:22:28,782
So you haul it down, what's left of it,
and you resign yourself...

1120
01:22:29,783 --> 01:22:33,520
Then suddenly out of nowhere
comes a boat so unexpected,

1121
01:22:33,554 --> 01:22:36,323
all white sails on the horizon.

1122
01:22:36,356 --> 01:22:38,826
To you, my beautiful boat.

1123
01:22:40,327 --> 01:22:42,629
Phoebe, you make me feel awful.

1124
01:22:42,696 --> 01:22:46,700
Well, you are beautiful and you're fun
and you're good to me.

1125
01:22:46,734 --> 01:22:50,270
Stop it. I'm not that good.
Some day you may find...

1126
01:22:50,304 --> 01:22:52,406
You talk an awful lot for a boat.

1127
01:22:53,907 --> 01:22:55,809
To us.

1128
01:23:09,590 --> 01:23:15,262
Want to buy some illusions slightly used?

1129
01:23:15,295 --> 01:23:18,599
Just like new

1130
01:23:18,699 --> 01:23:22,069
Such romantic illusions

1131
01:23:22,102 --> 01:23:26,774
And they're all about you

1132
01:23:27,641 --> 01:23:32,312
I'd sell them all for a penny

1133
01:23:32,346 --> 01:23:36,283
They make pretty souvenirs

1134
01:23:37,418 --> 01:23:41,388
Take my lovely illusions

1135
01:23:41,422 --> 01:23:43,724
Some for love

1136
01:23:44,691 --> 01:23:50,531
Some for tears

1137
01:23:55,803 --> 01:23:57,905
- Good evening.
- May I?

1138
01:23:59,206 --> 01:24:02,076
- Get another glass, John.
- No thank you.

1139
01:24:04,244 --> 01:24:06,480
My, look at the kitchen floor.

1140
01:24:07,981 --> 01:24:11,018
- Look at what?
- Such a change.

1141
01:24:11,051 --> 01:24:14,688
This dress. This dress is from Iowa?

1142
01:24:14,722 --> 01:24:17,124
Oh, no, Berlin. Do you like it?

1143
01:24:17,825 --> 01:24:22,129
It's stunning but haven't you
got it on backwards? And the hair.

1144
01:24:23,163 --> 01:24:25,799
What did you put in
those pigtails, shoelaces?

1145
01:24:25,899 --> 01:24:28,769
- I like it.
- He likes it.

1146
01:24:28,802 --> 01:24:33,240
I shouldn't have mentioned the eyebrows.
Now her face looks bow-legged.

1147
01:24:33,307 --> 01:24:37,077
Miss von Schlьtow, I think
the pianist is looking for you.

1148
01:24:37,111 --> 01:24:40,380
Have you ever made any progress
hunting down that man?

1149
01:24:40,414 --> 01:24:42,483
- What man?
- My man.

1150
01:24:42,549 --> 01:24:44,284
Oh.

1151
01:24:44,318 --> 01:24:49,556
Oh, a little progress, only that's all been
postponed on account of another man.

1152
01:24:49,590 --> 01:24:52,626
Look at him. Isn't he beautiful?

1153
01:24:52,659 --> 01:24:55,562
Phoebe, please.
She always kids me like that.

1154
01:24:55,662 --> 01:25:00,467
- I know he's not pretty but he's beautiful.
- When are you leaving Berlin?

1155
01:25:00,501 --> 01:25:03,537
- Tomorrow. It's our last night together.
- Too bad.

1156
01:25:03,570 --> 01:25:06,340
What he doesn't know is he's going too.

1157
01:25:06,373 --> 01:25:08,809
- I am?
- I talked it over with the general.

1158
01:25:08,876 --> 01:25:11,678
- It was to be a surprise.
- It is.

1159
01:25:11,745 --> 01:25:13,814
- I can't go.
- Yes, you can.

1160
01:25:13,881 --> 01:25:16,550
He hasn't had a furlough in four years.

1161
01:25:17,451 --> 01:25:22,122
This is a bolt from the blue.
I didn't have the slightest, faintest...

1162
01:25:22,189 --> 01:25:25,459
Miss von Schlьtow,
isn't it time for your next number?

1163
01:25:25,492 --> 01:25:28,262
There'll be no next number tonight.

1164
01:25:28,295 --> 01:25:31,131
May I steal
one of your American cigarettes?

1165
01:25:47,314 --> 01:25:50,451
Hey, Pringle.
John, the Colonel's looking for you.

1166
01:25:51,251 --> 01:25:53,153
- Colonel?
- Yelling his head off.

1167
01:25:53,187 --> 01:25:55,856
He's got enough blood
in his eye to sell by the pint.

1168
01:25:55,923 --> 01:25:59,493
- What does he want?
- I don't know. Get down to his office.

1169
01:26:01,161 --> 01:26:03,330
Check! Check! Er...

1170
01:26:03,397 --> 01:26:05,799
Go on. I'll take care of the check. Hurry.

1171
01:26:05,866 --> 01:26:10,037
- I'll drop you on the way.
- I'll take Miss Frost home. Get going.

1172
01:26:10,070 --> 01:26:12,539
Why are you going? It's so nice here.

1173
01:26:12,573 --> 01:26:15,609
- I got to go. Didn't you hear?
- I forbid you.

1174
01:26:15,642 --> 01:26:18,412
- Phoebe, this is the army.
- I don't want you to go.

1175
01:26:18,479 --> 01:26:20,114
I got to go.

1176
01:26:20,147 --> 01:26:23,417
All right. You're in contempt of Congress.

1177
01:26:24,485 --> 01:26:26,954
Take care of our friend. Goodbye.

1178
01:26:26,987 --> 01:26:29,056
Goodbye, Frдulein von Schlьtow.

1179
01:26:31,625 --> 01:26:34,261
- How much?
- No, this is on the house.

1180
01:26:34,328 --> 01:26:38,031
- Thank you. Ready, Miss Frost?
- Sit down. Have some champagne.

1181
01:26:38,065 --> 01:26:41,135
Another bottle.

1182
01:26:41,201 --> 01:26:43,237
Sit down.

1183
01:26:46,140 --> 01:26:50,411
No, I really shouldn't be in a place like this.

1184
01:27:22,576 --> 01:27:25,045
Ha!

1185
01:27:32,853 --> 01:27:36,590
The stars at night are big and bright

1186
01:27:37,458 --> 01:27:39,526
Deep in the heart of Texas

1187
01:27:40,394 --> 01:27:43,564
The prairie sky is wide and high

1188
01:27:44,231 --> 01:27:47,267
- Deep in the heart of Texas
- Yahoo!

1189
01:27:47,301 --> 01:27:50,838
The sage in bloom is like perfume

1190
01:27:50,904 --> 01:27:53,707
Deep in the heart of Texas

1191
01:27:53,741 --> 01:27:57,311
Reminds me of the one I love

1192
01:27:57,344 --> 01:27:59,813
Deep in the heart of Texas

1193
01:28:02,783 --> 01:28:05,085
Don't suppose you boys
know the Iowa song?

1194
01:28:05,152 --> 01:28:08,155
- Iowa, where's that?
- In the United States, silly.

1195
01:28:08,222 --> 01:28:10,457
- Since when?
- 1846.

1196
01:28:10,557 --> 01:28:14,061
No kidding.

1197
01:28:19,099 --> 01:28:23,370
- Would you like to play it?
- We'll play it but we don't like it.

1198
01:28:25,272 --> 01:28:27,674
- My old campaign song.
- Sing it.

1199
01:28:27,741 --> 01:28:29,777
- No.
- You must. You asked for it.

1200
01:28:29,877 --> 01:28:33,414
Maybe there's some boats around.
Who knows? Go on.

1201
01:28:34,314 --> 01:28:38,352
Ioway, Ioway

1202
01:28:38,385 --> 01:28:41,955
State of all the land, joy on every hand

1203
01:28:41,989 --> 01:28:46,660
We are from Ioway, Ioway

1204
01:28:46,693 --> 01:28:50,230
That's where the tall corn grows

1205
01:28:51,398 --> 01:28:55,169
Fly away, Ioway

1206
01:28:55,202 --> 01:28:58,739
State of all the land, joy on every hand

1207
01:28:58,772 --> 01:29:02,342
We are from Ioway...

1208
01:29:15,823 --> 01:29:20,260
We are from Ioway, Ioway

1209
01:29:20,294 --> 01:29:23,097
That's where the tall corn grows

1210
01:29:23,130 --> 01:29:25,566
Everybody, sing!

1211
01:29:25,632 --> 01:29:30,504
We are from Ioway, Ioway

1212
01:29:30,537 --> 01:29:33,874
State of all the land, joy on every hand

1213
01:29:33,974 --> 01:29:38,278
We are from Ioway, Ioway

1214
01:29:38,312 --> 01:29:42,015
That's where the tall corn grows

1215
01:30:01,869 --> 01:30:06,173
This is a raid. All military personnel,
get out their papers.

1216
01:30:11,712 --> 01:30:13,814
Whoo-hoo!

1217
01:30:15,749 --> 01:30:18,385
Hey. Hey, you.

1218
01:30:19,420 --> 01:30:21,321
Who-hoo.

1219
01:30:21,388 --> 01:30:23,590
Hey.

1220
01:30:25,959 --> 01:30:27,528
Jawohl!

1221
01:30:28,996 --> 01:30:31,465
Oh, will you...

1222
01:30:31,498 --> 01:30:33,667
Where are we going?

1223
01:30:34,768 --> 01:30:36,837
Pretty hat. Let me try it on.

1224
01:30:57,758 --> 01:31:01,295
What's this? What's happening?
Where are we going?

1225
01:31:02,262 --> 01:31:05,399
- To the police station. This is a raid.
- A what?

1226
01:31:05,432 --> 01:31:09,169
- A raid. We have one every other week.
- That's ridiculous.

1227
01:31:09,203 --> 01:31:11,138
They want to check up on our papers.

1228
01:31:11,171 --> 01:31:13,807
We Germans have to have
our papers in order.

1229
01:31:13,841 --> 01:31:16,310
But I'm not a German. They have no right...

1230
01:31:16,343 --> 01:31:20,647
Of course they haven't. There's
no reason why you should submit to it.

1231
01:31:20,681 --> 01:31:25,452
You just tell them who you are and
they'll apologise and let you go home.

1232
01:31:25,519 --> 01:31:28,789
Only on second thoughts, is it a good idea?

1233
01:31:28,822 --> 01:31:32,426
What kind of an impression
will it make on us Germans?

1234
01:31:32,426 --> 01:31:37,464
A Congresswoman of the United States
of America caught at the Lorelei.

1235
01:31:38,365 --> 01:31:41,935
And where did the Honourable
Miss Frost get that dress?

1236
01:31:41,969 --> 01:31:44,204
The black market, maybe?

1237
01:32:09,096 --> 01:32:12,232
- Want some coffee, Captain?
- No thanks, sir.

1238
01:32:12,266 --> 01:32:15,335
- Just as well. This is the only cup.
- Yes, sir.

1239
01:32:15,369 --> 01:32:18,472
How about a jigger of poison
with a hemlock chaser?

1240
01:32:18,505 --> 01:32:20,407
More like it, sir.

1241
01:32:21,408 --> 01:32:26,714
Captain, I think you have as good
a war record as any man in this town.

1242
01:32:26,747 --> 01:32:31,051
You were on the first team since Normandy
and you sure carried the ball.

1243
01:32:31,085 --> 01:32:36,123
I know you were among the first ten men
to cross the Remagen Bridge.

1244
01:32:36,156 --> 01:32:38,926
I also know why you were in such a hurry.

1245
01:32:40,094 --> 01:32:43,197
Did you know what a hot potato
you had on your hands?

1246
01:32:43,297 --> 01:32:48,602
Well, not quite, sir.
I... had a hunch it was warm, all right.

1247
01:32:48,635 --> 01:32:51,305
Sometimes I wonder
if it isn't a waste of money

1248
01:32:51,305 --> 01:32:55,609
to import 11,000 ping-pong tables
for the recreation of you young men.

1249
01:32:57,444 --> 01:32:59,446
Captain, you might as well realise

1250
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:02,683
we've been wise to you
and the von Schlьtow woman all along.

1251
01:33:02,716 --> 01:33:04,718
I kind of figured you were peeking.

1252
01:33:04,752 --> 01:33:08,522
The army has been counting on you
for a certain pattern of behaviour.

1253
01:33:08,555 --> 01:33:11,358
- You let us down but good.
- Sorry, sir.

1254
01:33:12,393 --> 01:33:15,896
Since that committee arrived,
you've been playing a double bill

1255
01:33:15,929 --> 01:33:18,165
with the lady from Iowa in the upper half.

1256
01:33:18,198 --> 01:33:21,235
I'd appreciate it
if you leave her out of this, sir.

1257
01:33:22,302 --> 01:33:24,138
You would?

1258
01:33:25,272 --> 01:33:30,010
Pressure has been exerted to have you
go back to the United States for a while.

1259
01:33:30,110 --> 01:33:32,846
- So I've heard.
- You're not going of course.

1260
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:36,417
Of course. When do proceedings start, sir?

1261
01:33:37,484 --> 01:33:42,322
Captain Pringle, you're to stay away
from that certain party, off limits.

1262
01:33:42,356 --> 01:33:46,093
Suits me fine. It was all washed up
anyway as far as I'm concerned.

1263
01:33:46,126 --> 01:33:51,065
Let's get this straight. You're to stay
away from the Congresswoman.

1264
01:33:51,098 --> 01:33:52,800
Oh?

1265
01:33:52,833 --> 01:33:55,369
Pick up that torch for
Frдulein von Schlьtow,

1266
01:33:55,402 --> 01:33:58,439
light it again and carry it in public,
that's an order.

1267
01:33:59,406 --> 01:34:02,676
- Well, how do you do.
- You've heard of Hans Otto Birgel?

1268
01:34:02,710 --> 01:34:06,213
- That was her guy.
- He's hiding out in the American zone.

1269
01:34:06,246 --> 01:34:08,549
- He's dead.
- He's very much alive.

1270
01:34:08,582 --> 01:34:10,617
And thanks to you, he's kicking.

1271
01:34:10,651 --> 01:34:13,921
We had a hunch about him
so we watched Miss von Schlьtow.

1272
01:34:13,987 --> 01:34:16,123
Here are three letters we intercepted.

1273
01:34:16,156 --> 01:34:20,994
Someone tipped him off that his girl
has been seeing an American officer.

1274
01:34:21,028 --> 01:34:24,765
He's a jealous rat. He says he's going
to come out and kill you both.

1275
01:34:25,799 --> 01:34:29,503
- That's cute.
- Now, go on back and fan those flames.

1276
01:34:29,603 --> 01:34:32,539
Stick around the Frдulein until he shows.

1277
01:34:32,573 --> 01:34:35,275
I wish I'd never crossed
the Remagen Bridge.

1278
01:34:35,309 --> 01:34:37,811
Sorry, son, that's the way it reads.

1279
01:34:37,878 --> 01:34:41,982
OK, I'm going.
Only I think I'll have that coffee first.

1280
01:34:42,082 --> 01:34:45,786
Never mind the cup.
Just give me a spoonful of the powder.

1281
01:35:08,776 --> 01:35:11,879
- Do you have your passport with you?
- No.

1282
01:35:11,912 --> 01:35:16,083
You just tell them who you are
and they check with the army officials.

1283
01:35:16,150 --> 01:35:18,786
- I can't do that.
- Why?

1284
01:35:18,819 --> 01:35:23,524
What if the German papers pick it up
and there are some ugly references?

1285
01:35:23,557 --> 01:35:25,626
May never reach Washington.

1286
01:35:26,727 --> 01:35:31,498
Of course there's one person who could
get you out of all this nastiness.

1287
01:35:31,565 --> 01:35:33,834
Me. I could do it.

1288
01:35:34,802 --> 01:35:37,705
No names mentioned. No aftereffects.

1289
01:35:37,805 --> 01:35:39,840
Just as if it never happened.

1290
01:35:41,008 --> 01:35:43,711
Why should you? You don't like me.

1291
01:35:43,744 --> 01:35:47,681
It's not generosity. We Germans
can't afford to be generous.

1292
01:35:47,748 --> 01:35:49,817
We're very poor.

1293
01:35:49,883 --> 01:35:52,553
It's give and take if we are to survive.

1294
01:35:53,554 --> 01:35:55,956
What have I to give?

1295
01:35:56,023 --> 01:35:59,960
What do you want to take?

1296
01:37:04,425 --> 01:37:08,695
You know what I told him?
That you were a country cousin of mine.

1297
01:37:08,729 --> 01:37:11,231
Perfectly easy if you have a safe conduct

1298
01:37:11,265 --> 01:37:14,568
with the signature of
a kind American officer on it.

1299
01:37:14,601 --> 01:37:17,071
And you wanted to chop his head off.

1300
01:37:17,104 --> 01:37:20,441
Exactly what is it you want from me,
Frдulein von Schlьtow?

1301
01:37:20,541 --> 01:37:24,044
Let's go up to my apartment.
It's only a few ruins away from here.

1302
01:37:24,144 --> 01:37:26,780
- No, I'd rather not.
- You'd better.

1303
01:37:26,814 --> 01:37:28,882
You may need a handkerchief.

1304
01:37:32,886 --> 01:37:37,191
This is a beastly thing to do but you must
understand what happened to us here.

1305
01:37:37,224 --> 01:37:40,527
We all become animals
with exactly one instinct left.

1306
01:37:40,561 --> 01:37:42,463
Self-preservation.

1307
01:37:42,496 --> 01:37:45,799
Take me, Miss Frost.
Bombed out a dozen times.

1308
01:37:45,833 --> 01:37:48,569
Everything caved in
and pulled out from under me.

1309
01:37:48,635 --> 01:37:51,638
My country, my possessions, my beliefs.

1310
01:37:51,672 --> 01:37:53,774
Yet somehow I kept going.

1311
01:37:53,874 --> 01:37:58,278
Months in air-raid shelters
crammed in with 5,000 other people.

1312
01:37:58,312 --> 01:38:00,180
I kept going.

1313
01:38:00,247 --> 01:38:04,885
What do you think it was like to be a woman
here when the Russians swept in?

1314
01:38:04,918 --> 01:38:07,221
I kept going.

1315
01:38:07,254 --> 01:38:10,391
It was a living hell... and then I found a man.

1316
01:38:10,424 --> 01:38:13,994
And through that man,
a roof and a job and food and...

1317
01:38:15,329 --> 01:38:17,598
And I'm not going to lose him.

1318
01:38:17,631 --> 01:38:19,700
What has all this to do with me?

1319
01:38:19,733 --> 01:38:23,037
A little. You see, you want the same man.

1320
01:38:24,772 --> 01:38:28,742
Come on. I told you
you'd need a handkerchief.

1321
01:38:56,136 --> 01:38:59,506
This is how he looked when I met him first.
He was a lieutenant.

1322
01:38:59,573 --> 01:39:02,209
He sat at his desk interrogating me.

1323
01:39:02,242 --> 01:39:05,546
He had such a grim, businesslike face,

1324
01:39:05,612 --> 01:39:09,883
but fortunately I was wearing
my last pair of silk stockings.

1325
01:39:10,884 --> 01:39:13,187
He's really a nice boy.

1326
01:39:13,253 --> 01:39:15,889
You mustn't judge him
by what he did to you.

1327
01:39:16,690 --> 01:39:18,592
He hated it. I know.

1328
01:39:18,592 --> 01:39:23,297
Of course, he would come here
and feel so miserable and sorry for you.

1329
01:39:23,330 --> 01:39:26,266
Your plane is leaving tomorrow, isn't it?

1330
01:39:28,836 --> 01:39:33,874
Don't sit there as if it was the end
of the world. Nothing happened.

1331
01:39:33,941 --> 01:39:36,677
He played a dirty trick on you, that's all.

1332
01:39:37,578 --> 01:39:41,849
So you fly off back home,
wash your hands, wash your lips...

1333
01:39:42,883 --> 01:39:45,986
They've got so much soap
in the United States.

1334
01:39:47,654 --> 01:39:50,557
Sorry. You know this game of love.

1335
01:39:50,657 --> 01:39:53,494
If you want to take
the advice of an old gambler,

1336
01:39:53,527 --> 01:39:56,864
some people are lucky at it,
some people are jinxed.

1337
01:39:57,765 --> 01:40:00,601
They shouldn't even sit down at the table.

1338
01:40:08,208 --> 01:40:10,511
I do not imagine you care to see him again.

1339
01:40:10,544 --> 01:40:14,681
Why not go up the stairs where it's dark
until he comes in and then leave?

1340
01:40:18,385 --> 01:40:21,055
Go on, leave. Haven't you had enough?

1341
01:40:24,892 --> 01:40:26,960
What is this, a big scene?

1342
01:40:27,027 --> 01:40:30,831
We can't keep a gentleman
in the dark, can we?

1343
01:40:30,864 --> 01:40:34,134
Four hours ago you could
have had him court-martialled

1344
01:40:34,168 --> 01:40:37,237
and sent me to a labour camp, not now.

1345
01:40:37,271 --> 01:40:40,307
Not any more. Now you're one of us.

1346
01:40:52,519 --> 01:40:54,388
Hi.

1347
01:41:02,129 --> 01:41:05,432
What's the matter?
No kiss for your little Schweinehund?

1348
01:41:07,134 --> 01:41:11,205
I'm sorry I had to show up with that
Congress dame. She's gone dappy.

1349
01:41:11,271 --> 01:41:14,842
Doesn't mean a thing.
Leaving tomorrow anyway.

1350
01:41:14,875 --> 01:41:16,744
Come on.

1351
01:41:40,868 --> 01:41:42,770
Sorry.

1352
01:41:45,539 --> 01:41:49,843
I guess this is where the funny man says,
"Shall we dance?"

1353
01:41:49,877 --> 01:41:52,579
You are not a funny man, Captain Pringle.

1354
01:41:53,514 --> 01:41:55,949
But you are quite a dancer.

1355
01:41:55,983 --> 01:41:58,118
What a waltz we had.

1356
01:41:59,119 --> 01:42:01,021
Good night.

1357
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:42,396
Shh! Hey, Frдulein!
Hey, Frдulein!

1358
01:42:44,565 --> 01:42:47,501
Hey, Frдulein!
Hey, Frдulein!

1359
01:42:47,534 --> 01:42:49,536
Ein moment, Frдulein!

1360
01:42:51,805 --> 01:42:53,907
Holy mackerel!

1361
01:43:46,860 --> 01:43:50,364
The last time we had
one of these, it lasted 11 days.

1362
01:43:50,431 --> 01:43:52,132
You're a great comfort.

1363
01:43:52,166 --> 01:43:57,237
You can't get to Washington soon enough,
can you, to dash off that black Berlin report?

1364
01:43:57,271 --> 01:43:59,707
No report at all, Colonel Plummer.

1365
01:43:59,773 --> 01:44:03,677
- No?
- I came here as an objective observer.

1366
01:44:03,711 --> 01:44:07,481
Some things have happened
which automatically disqualify me.

1367
01:44:07,581 --> 01:44:09,650
Aren't you taking it a little big?

1368
01:44:09,717 --> 01:44:13,053
- You know nothing whatever about it.
- I got a hunch.

1369
01:44:13,087 --> 01:44:17,024
In a way, I'm glad you took off the blinkers
and wandered away on your own.

1370
01:44:17,091 --> 01:44:20,861
It's a big mess we're trying to clean up.
There's a lot of rubble.

1371
01:44:20,894 --> 01:44:24,965
Rubble of all kinds,
vegetable, mineral and animal.

1372
01:44:24,998 --> 01:44:29,036
You walk around on it, you're apt to get
conked on the head by a loose brick.

1373
01:44:29,069 --> 01:44:31,739
Stop it, please.
I've had about all I can stand.

1374
01:44:31,772 --> 01:44:36,710
I'm sorry but I feel a little
responsible about that loose brick, Pringle.

1375
01:44:36,777 --> 01:44:40,080
- Colonel, please.
- I'm not trying to whitewash him.

1376
01:44:40,147 --> 01:44:42,583
There isn't enough paint in Germany for that

1377
01:44:42,616 --> 01:44:45,552
but let me scrape together
something in his defence.

1378
01:44:45,619 --> 01:44:48,055
- I'm not listening.
- Take it from me.

1379
01:44:48,088 --> 01:44:50,190
He won't get off scot-free.

1380
01:44:50,224 --> 01:44:53,293
As a matter of fact,
he's started to pay already.

1381
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:57,498
It's no fun to walk around
with a target pinned on your chest.

1382
01:45:00,401 --> 01:45:03,337
I'd appreciate it if you'd leave me alone.

1383
01:45:05,205 --> 01:45:07,975
How's about some reading matter
for the plane?

1384
01:45:09,009 --> 01:45:13,647
Those aren't teardrops. I was washing my
hands when he asked me to give it to you.

1385
01:45:15,616 --> 01:45:18,118
All right, I'll put it right there.

1386
01:45:29,229 --> 01:45:33,500
Colonel Plummer, it's clearing. We should
be taking off in about 20 minutes.

1387
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:35,669
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

1388
01:45:45,045 --> 01:45:50,117
Gentlemen, I was just informed there will
be no flights until tomorrow morning.

1389
01:45:50,150 --> 01:45:53,420
Now, we might as well
get ourselves back into town.

1390
01:45:53,487 --> 01:45:57,658
Sorry, Miss Frost. We're going
to wait for the fog to lift a little.

1391
01:46:14,875 --> 01:46:19,179
Amidst the ruins of Berlin

1392
01:46:19,213 --> 01:46:23,484
Trees are in bloom
as they have never been

1393
01:46:23,517 --> 01:46:27,554
Sometimes at night
you feel in all your sorrow

1394
01:46:27,588 --> 01:46:31,658
Her perfume as of a sweet tomorrow

1395
01:46:31,692 --> 01:46:35,829
That's when you realise at last

1396
01:46:35,896 --> 01:46:39,867
They won't return
the phantoms of the past

1397
01:46:39,900 --> 01:46:44,071
A brand new spring is to begin

1398
01:46:44,104 --> 01:46:47,408
Out of the ruins of Berlin

1399
01:46:52,846 --> 01:46:57,117
Amidst the ruins of Berlin

1400
01:46:57,151 --> 01:47:01,388
Trees are in bloom
as they have never been...

1401
01:47:29,116 --> 01:47:31,618
Hans Otto Birgel.

1402
01:47:31,652 --> 01:47:34,154
Amidst the ruins of Berlin

1403
01:47:34,922 --> 01:47:39,093
Trees are in bloom
as they have never been

1404
01:47:39,159 --> 01:47:43,230
Sometimes at night
you feel in all your sorrow

1405
01:47:43,297 --> 01:47:47,301
Her perfume as of a sweet tomorrow

1406
01:47:47,368 --> 01:47:51,505
That's when you realise at last

1407
01:47:51,538 --> 01:47:55,542
They won't return
the phantoms of the past

1408
01:47:55,576 --> 01:47:59,646
A brand new spring is to begin

1409
01:47:59,680 --> 01:48:03,617
Out of the ruins of Berlin

1410
01:49:39,146 --> 01:49:43,484
So we followed her all day
until the five o'clock shadow showed.

1411
01:49:43,517 --> 01:49:46,253
- Sure enough, she was Hermann.
- Well, doggone.

1412
01:49:46,286 --> 01:49:48,355
You sure spin some tall tales.

1413
01:49:48,389 --> 01:49:51,725
Yeah, well, how about this?
Hans Otto Birgel.

1414
01:49:51,759 --> 01:49:54,228
Big Gestapo man hiding out underground.

1415
01:49:54,294 --> 01:49:58,565
The only lead we have is that
he's still crazy about a former lady friend,

1416
01:49:58,599 --> 01:50:01,602
a nightclub singer
somewhere in the American sector.

1417
01:50:02,836 --> 01:50:06,640
Herr Birgel suspects she's two-timing him
so he crawls out of his hole.

1418
01:50:06,640 --> 01:50:08,909
Only he doesn't crawl fast enough.

1419
01:50:08,942 --> 01:50:12,212
So we play it up a little
with the help of an American officer.

1420
01:50:12,246 --> 01:50:14,114
A captain, to be exact.

1421
01:50:14,148 --> 01:50:17,751
Make a fancy story in
a Sunday supplement someday.

1422
01:50:17,785 --> 01:50:21,221
- The Love Commando.
- Ha.

1423
01:50:21,255 --> 01:50:25,225
Here's their angle. The Captain
isn't very keen for the assignment,

1424
01:50:25,259 --> 01:50:28,529
having fallen for
somebody else in the meantime.

1425
01:50:28,562 --> 01:50:31,832
You know how they cook it up
with a lot of marshmallow on top.

1426
01:50:31,865 --> 01:50:35,169
Then the story of how
they got the poison into Gцring's cell.

1427
01:50:35,202 --> 01:50:38,172
There were two scrub women...

1428
01:50:40,174 --> 01:50:44,278
Sorry, sir. The car has to pull in.
Keeping the street open for the ambulance.

1429
01:50:44,344 --> 01:50:46,613
- What's up?
- Trouble at the Lorelei.

1430
01:50:46,647 --> 01:50:50,084
- Birgel showed up. There was shooting.
- Who got it?

1431
01:50:50,117 --> 01:50:53,120
- I don't know, sir.
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

1432
01:50:53,187 --> 01:50:55,923
Perhaps you'd want
to come along, Miss Frost.

1433
01:50:59,093 --> 01:51:00,361
Hey!

1434
01:51:51,412 --> 01:51:55,115
Mm-hm. Two plugs right through the kisser.

1435
01:51:55,983 --> 01:51:57,084
No.

1436
01:51:58,952 --> 01:52:02,489
- It was an ugly kisser anyway.
- It was not.

1437
01:52:02,589 --> 01:52:05,659
He was no good
and he's dead and it's OK by me.

1438
01:52:05,726 --> 01:52:07,261
Ohh...

1439
01:52:07,294 --> 01:52:09,329
No sense of humour.

1440
01:52:09,363 --> 01:52:11,465
Take care of her, lover boy.

1441
01:52:20,274 --> 01:52:22,543
- All right, clean up the mess.
- Yes, sir.

1442
01:52:22,576 --> 01:52:27,247
Find him a slab before the Russkies
start tossing him up to the ceiling.

1443
01:52:31,452 --> 01:52:33,354
Go on home!

1444
01:52:33,387 --> 01:52:36,090
Come on, break it up, let's go. All right.

1445
01:52:39,827 --> 01:52:41,495
Where are you taking me?

1446
01:52:41,562 --> 01:52:45,566
Looks like you've got a date
with five million von bricks.

1447
01:52:45,599 --> 01:52:47,768
I have a paper saying I'm on the white list.

1448
01:52:47,868 --> 01:52:49,903
We know how you got it and it wasn't,

1449
01:52:49,970 --> 01:52:52,973
if you'll pardon
the non-Aryan expression, kosher.

1450
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:55,242
You do not understand. There's a mix-up.

1451
01:52:55,275 --> 01:52:58,379
Yeah. We just sent part of it
off to the morgue.

1452
01:52:58,379 --> 01:53:01,482
- Just ask Captain Pringle.
- Forget Captain Pringle.

1453
01:53:01,515 --> 01:53:06,186
How could I ever forget him?
He's so nice. I will miss him terribly.

1454
01:53:06,220 --> 01:53:08,288
- Please tell him.
- No soap.

1455
01:53:08,322 --> 01:53:10,891
And no chocolate, no cigarettes.

1456
01:53:10,924 --> 01:53:13,027
Tough.

1457
01:53:14,128 --> 01:53:18,699
Tell me, Colonel, are you
that wonderful Colonel Plummer?

1458
01:53:18,732 --> 01:53:23,203
That's me,
only most of the time they call me delicious.

1459
01:53:23,270 --> 01:53:27,574
Colonel, if I could come to your office
tomorrow sometime,

1460
01:53:27,608 --> 01:53:29,576
when you're not too busy.

1461
01:53:29,610 --> 01:53:33,514
Miss von Schlьtow,
I've become a grandfather today.

1462
01:53:33,547 --> 01:53:35,416
Let's not be silly.

1463
01:53:36,183 --> 01:53:38,252
She's all yours.

1464
01:53:38,285 --> 01:53:41,088
Can they take me
by my apartment so I can change?

1465
01:53:41,155 --> 01:53:44,725
- I guess so.
- Come on, boys.

1466
01:53:46,026 --> 01:53:48,128
Has it stopped raining?

1467
01:53:48,162 --> 01:53:52,299
If there are any puddles,
you'll carry me, won't you, boys?

1468
01:54:01,942 --> 01:54:04,211
You two, watch out for those two.

1469
01:54:04,244 --> 01:54:06,280
Yes, sir.

1470
01:54:11,985 --> 01:54:15,255
- And you watch out for them.
- That ought to do it.

1471
01:54:25,332 --> 01:54:28,335
He said there were two plugs in your kisser.

1472
01:54:28,369 --> 01:54:31,672
There ought to be.
I'm sorry about everything.

1473
01:54:31,705 --> 01:54:34,441
- Except the time with you.
- Take that away.

1474
01:54:34,475 --> 01:54:38,579
It's true. With all the headaches ahead,
you'll be my aspirin.

1475
01:54:38,612 --> 01:54:40,881
That's nice, but what about my headache?

1476
01:54:40,948 --> 01:54:42,950
You're on your way back home.

1477
01:54:43,017 --> 01:54:46,754
You'll be all right by the time
you fasten your seat belt.

1478
01:54:46,787 --> 01:54:48,822
I love you, John.

1479
01:54:50,491 --> 01:54:54,061
No, you don't. I'm just a hit-and-run boy.

1480
01:54:54,128 --> 01:54:57,231
The kind of guy you need
is somebody to marry.

1481
01:54:57,264 --> 01:54:58,932
Well?

1482
01:54:58,966 --> 01:55:01,935
Oh, no. I'm not somebody anybody marries.

1483
01:55:03,037 --> 01:55:09,109
You need somebody respectable,
a senator, a Supreme Court judge,

1484
01:55:09,176 --> 01:55:13,180
maybe... somebody from
the Smithsonian Institute.

1485
01:55:13,247 --> 01:55:14,915
I know who I want.

1486
01:55:14,948 --> 01:55:17,685
Not me, I'm a heel, a certified heel.

1487
01:55:17,718 --> 01:55:20,387
I got documents to prove it.

1488
01:55:20,421 --> 01:55:22,790
Listen...

1489
01:55:22,823 --> 01:55:26,960
"Listen, my children, and you shall hear
of the midnight ride of Paul Revere

1490
01:55:26,994 --> 01:55:31,298
"On the 18th of April in '75, hardly a man
is now alive who remembers..."

1491
01:55:34,134 --> 01:55:35,436
Oh...
