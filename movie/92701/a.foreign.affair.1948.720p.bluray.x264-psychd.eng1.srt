1
00:01:58,501 --> 00:02:02,250
Congressmen, we're now
flying over the heart of Berlin.

2
00:02:03,174 --> 00:02:05,249
Berlin.

3
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:10,379
Over 75,000 tons of explosives
were dropped here.

4
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,718
British Lancasters by night,
American Fortresses by day.

5
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:17,718
I heard Russian artillery
had a little part in it too, if you don't mind.

6
00:02:17,772 --> 00:02:21,308
Sure they did and I wish
they'd pay us for all those cannons.

7
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:25,310
Hey, quit juggling. Film like this
is good stuff around election time.

8
00:02:25,364 --> 00:02:27,072
The incumbent overseas.

9
00:02:27,073 --> 00:02:29,825
Pennecot, don't you want to see it?
Look at it.

10
00:02:29,868 --> 00:02:34,530
Like pack rats been gnawing at a hunk
of old mouldy Roquefort cheese.

11
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,333
Miss Frost? Congresswoman Frost?

12
00:02:44,385 --> 00:02:47,054
- Present.
- We're flying over Berlin.

13
00:02:49,765 --> 00:02:52,054
15 minutes ahead of schedule.

14
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,557
Well, don't you want to see it?

15
00:02:54,604 --> 00:02:56,680
One thing at a time.

16
00:03:35,356 --> 00:03:39,307
You got quite a sight coming.
Looks like chicken innards at frying time.

17
00:03:39,361 --> 00:03:42,030
Considering the taxpayers' money
poured on it,

18
00:03:42,073 --> 00:03:44,562
I don't expect it to look like a lace Valentine.

19
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,830
Golly.

20
00:03:55,962 --> 00:03:59,912
Well, that's rough doing.
That sure is rough doing.

21
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:08,214
They ought to put in grass
and move in a herd of longhorn.

22
00:04:08,267 --> 00:04:11,850
Build up their industries.
Get those smokestacks belching again.

23
00:04:11,896 --> 00:04:15,182
- Not without organised labour.
- We got to feed the people.

24
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:18,437
You can't keep a country
eating scraps out of garbage pails.

25
00:04:18,487 --> 00:04:21,772
I'm all for sending food,
only let 'em know where it's from.

26
00:04:21,823 --> 00:04:23,900
I object to dollar diplomacy.

27
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:27,237
- But you don't mind sending food.
- There's a difference.

28
00:04:27,288 --> 00:04:29,958
If you give a hungry man bread,
that's democracy.

29
00:04:29,999 --> 00:04:32,953
If you leave the wrapper on, it's imperialism.

30
00:04:33,002 --> 00:04:36,751
Gentlemen, these are
very grave problems indeed

31
00:04:36,798 --> 00:04:40,086
but they don't happen to be
the problems of this committee.

32
00:04:40,136 --> 00:04:43,172
Perhaps I should remind you
why we were sent to Berlin,

33
00:04:43,222 --> 00:04:46,140
since our chairman,
Mr Pennecot of New Hampshire,

34
00:04:46,184 --> 00:04:50,477
has been indisposed ever since
we took off from Washington.

35
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,815
We're here to investigate the morale
of American occupation troops,

36
00:04:54,859 --> 00:04:56,778
nothing else.

37
00:04:56,779 --> 00:05:00,313
12,000 of our boys are policing
that pest hole down below

38
00:05:00,365 --> 00:05:05,656
and according to reports, they are being
infected by a kind of moral malaria.

39
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:10,533
It is our duty to their wives, their mothers,
their sisters, to find the facts.

40
00:05:10,585 --> 00:05:12,661
And if these reports are true,

41
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:17,006
to fumigate that place with
all the insecticides at our disposal.

42
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:21,096
If you'll pardon me,
we're approaching Tempelhof Airfield.

43
00:05:22,473 --> 00:05:25,759
Oh, God, if they haven't got
a reception out for us.

44
00:05:25,809 --> 00:05:27,728
A band and everything.

45
00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:30,017
They'll be glad to see home folks.

46
00:05:40,033 --> 00:05:45,076
Men, once more it is our honour and
privilege to welcome a visiting committee.

47
00:05:45,123 --> 00:05:49,667
Lately they seem to be coming
as regularly as the electric bill.

48
00:05:49,712 --> 00:05:52,167
This time it's not just VIPs.

49
00:05:52,214 --> 00:05:55,050
This time we're getting VIPIs.

50
00:05:55,092 --> 00:05:57,927
Very Important Persons Indeed.

51
00:05:57,969 --> 00:06:02,632
Some Congressional committee
to investigate our morale.

52
00:06:02,684 --> 00:06:07,345
Seems back home, they've got an idea
this here is one great big picnic,

53
00:06:07,396 --> 00:06:10,932
that all we do is swing in hammocks
with blonde Fräuleins,

54
00:06:10,984 --> 00:06:13,142
swap cigarettes for castles on the Rhine

55
00:06:13,194 --> 00:06:15,864
and soak our feet in sparkling Mosel.

56
00:06:15,906 --> 00:06:18,064
Well, let's not kid ourselves.

57
00:06:18,116 --> 00:06:20,951
Some of you do go
overboard once in a while.

58
00:06:20,994 --> 00:06:25,289
Maybe some of you are working too hard
to enlighten the civilian population

59
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:28,169
and maybe some of you
PX millionaires have found out

60
00:06:28,211 --> 00:06:32,505
you can parlay a pack of cigarettes
into something more than 20 smokes.

61
00:06:32,549 --> 00:06:35,586
After all, this isn't a Boy Scout camp.

62
00:06:35,635 --> 00:06:37,553
We've got a tough job on our hands

63
00:06:37,554 --> 00:06:40,840
and, by and large,
I think we're handling it darn well.

64
00:06:40,891 --> 00:06:43,644
For my dough, we're on the ball.

65
00:06:43,686 --> 00:06:46,523
Most of us, anyway... most of the time.

66
00:06:46,565 --> 00:06:52,604
What they've got to realise is you can't pin
sergeant's stripes on an archangel.

67
00:06:52,655 --> 00:06:55,691
Now, this committee
is going to be here for five days.

68
00:06:55,742 --> 00:06:58,577
Let's give them as good
an impression as possible.

69
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:01,455
Not pussyfooting
around with a phoney attitude.

70
00:07:01,498 --> 00:07:04,168
That's not fair to them or us.

71
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,245
I'm counting on you men to behave, period.

72
00:07:08,672 --> 00:07:12,372
Morale. Maybe some day we can send
a little committee of our own

73
00:07:12,425 --> 00:07:14,881
to investigate morale in Washington, DC.

74
00:07:19,726 --> 00:07:24,020
Hey, look what I picked up
at the Brandenburg Gate.

75
00:07:25,482 --> 00:07:27,770
- How much?
- A dozen candy bars.

76
00:07:28,653 --> 00:07:30,940
They've still got some nine and a halfs.

77
00:07:30,987 --> 00:07:33,443
- I got no one to give them to.
- How about Trudy?

78
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:37,239
I lost her. Russian sergeant came along
with a pound of rancid butter.

79
00:07:37,285 --> 00:07:40,572
- Those German dames are all alike.
- Speak for yourself.

80
00:07:40,623 --> 00:07:44,573
I wouldn't be afraid
of a Russian general with a ton of caviar.

81
00:07:45,545 --> 00:07:47,545
Nice toe.

82
00:07:49,841 --> 00:07:51,841
The best.

83
00:08:01,313 --> 00:08:03,601
We're here, Congressman.
Ready to unload?

84
00:08:14,367 --> 00:08:16,859
Present... arms!

85
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,382
- Hello, Colonel.
- Nice to see you, General.

86
00:08:37,435 --> 00:08:41,728
Mr Giffin from Texas, General Finney,
General McAndrew, Colonel Plummer.

87
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:44,062
- My pleasure.
- Mr Salvatore, from New York.

88
00:08:44,109 --> 00:08:47,692
- The Bronx.
- Nobody's going to think you're Wall Street.

89
00:08:47,737 --> 00:08:51,866
Mr Yandell, Congressman from Virginia.
Mr Kraus, Congressman from Illinois.

90
00:08:51,908 --> 00:08:55,657
Hold it, everybody.
Want to get some of this brass.

91
00:08:55,704 --> 00:08:57,623
Snappy little outfit you have.

92
00:08:57,624 --> 00:08:59,914
Thank you. I have to apologise for the band.

93
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,079
- You should indeed.
- We're half strength today.

94
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:05,799
- We generally have 40 pieces.
- That's terrible.

95
00:09:05,841 --> 00:09:09,922
We sent the others to the British sector
for a parade. It's Empire Day.

96
00:09:09,971 --> 00:09:14,633
What's terrible is I came hoping to find
an army taking its task with seriousness.

97
00:09:14,684 --> 00:09:17,140
Instead I find you have a 40-piece band.

98
00:09:17,187 --> 00:09:19,642
Perhaps you also have
some drum majorettes.

99
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:21,316
- May I introduce...
- I know.

100
00:09:21,317 --> 00:09:24,436
General Finney, General McAndrew
and Colonel Plummer.

101
00:09:24,486 --> 00:09:28,436
It's in my data. I am Miss Frost,
Congresswoman from Iowa, 9th district.

102
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:32,240
Delightful of Congress to send us
a lady representative for a change.

103
00:09:32,287 --> 00:09:33,495
Delightful.

104
00:09:33,496 --> 00:09:37,245
May I suggest here and now that
we dispense with all the soft soap.

105
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:40,577
As committee chairman,
permit me to bring you greetings

106
00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:43,666
from the people
of the United States of America.

107
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:48,758
This genial reception augurs well
for the success of our mission.

108
00:09:48,805 --> 00:09:53,596
I sincerely hope so. And now let us proceed
to a luncheon we have prepared for you.

109
00:09:53,642 --> 00:09:58,471
A very simple luncheon. Powdered egg
omelette, probably, and a little Spam.

110
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,196
- Can I carry that for you?
- No, thank you.

111
00:10:08,243 --> 00:10:11,991
I undertook to deliver it in person
to a Captain John Pringle,

112
00:10:12,038 --> 00:10:14,495
stationed somewhere in Berlin, G2 Section.

113
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:17,661
- Could you tell me how to go about it?
- I could try.

114
00:10:17,711 --> 00:10:21,162
Through army channels?
All I have is five days.

115
00:10:21,214 --> 00:10:23,214
Captain Pringle!

116
00:10:23,801 --> 00:10:25,801
Captain Pringle!

117
00:10:29,766 --> 00:10:31,641
Captain Pringle reporting, sir.

118
00:10:31,642 --> 00:10:34,477
Congresswoman Frost,
this is Captain Pringle.

119
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,056
Thank you. This is for you,
Captain Pringle. Happy birthday.

120
00:10:38,108 --> 00:10:41,691
Or happy birthday yesterday.
I thought I could deliver it on time

121
00:10:41,737 --> 00:10:45,022
but we were held up
in Newfoundland for 16 hours - fog.

122
00:10:45,073 --> 00:10:48,573
- You brought this from America?
- Murdoch, Iowa.

123
00:10:48,619 --> 00:10:50,907
Well, how is good old Iowa?

124
00:10:50,954 --> 00:10:53,030
62°% Republican, thank you.

125
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:57,661
I was entrusted with this by a constituent,
or rather, his daughter.

126
00:10:57,712 --> 00:11:00,382
I hope it's still in one piece. Open it.

127
00:11:00,424 --> 00:11:02,424
Be glad.

128
00:11:11,644 --> 00:11:14,314
Well, what do you know? Little Dusty.

129
00:11:16,651 --> 00:11:18,567
It's a beauty.

130
00:11:18,568 --> 00:11:20,645
I didn't know it was so personal.

131
00:11:20,696 --> 00:11:25,276
Her name is really Pauline Rose
but we call her Dusty. Some joke.

132
00:11:25,326 --> 00:11:29,074
- How long since you've seen her?
- Dusty? Four years.

133
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:32,705
Don't these boys ever get home?
Can't they be given a short leave?

134
00:11:32,751 --> 00:11:35,787
- Certainly, if it's accrued.
- I don't want any leave.

135
00:11:35,837 --> 00:11:38,957
- You don't?
- Oh, of course I do. Dying to.

136
00:11:39,007 --> 00:11:42,092
We're all homesick
but personal feelings don't matter.

137
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:44,211
There's unfinished business here.

138
00:11:44,263 --> 00:11:47,549
Now that we've won the war,
we mustn't lose the peace.

139
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,301
I hate to think of anybody
sitting in his lonely barracks

140
00:11:51,354 --> 00:11:53,271
with a birthday cake on his knees.

141
00:11:53,272 --> 00:11:56,559
I won't have the cake on my knees.
I won't be alone.

142
00:11:57,611 --> 00:12:00,066
There'll be my buddies. I'll call them in.

143
00:12:00,113 --> 00:12:03,399
We'll open up a case of root beer,
light the candles,

144
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,657
then Frankovitch and his ukulele.

145
00:12:05,702 --> 00:12:09,998
Some old songs.
Why, it'll be like back home... almost.

146
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,917
Good to hear you talk like that.

147
00:12:11,918 --> 00:12:14,076
General Finney wants you to go in his car.

148
00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:15,629
I'll be right with you.

149
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:20,376
If you're a sample of the spirit
prevailing in Berlin, I feel better already.

150
00:12:20,427 --> 00:12:22,884
- I'm a sample, all right.
- Goodbye.

151
00:12:28,185 --> 00:12:30,938
You're losing something, Captain Pringle.

152
00:12:31,898 --> 00:12:33,607
My handkerchief.

153
00:12:33,608 --> 00:12:36,065
You blow your nose in nylon nowadays?

154
00:12:38,656 --> 00:12:42,405
What do you know? There must have
been a mistake at the laundry.

155
00:12:42,453 --> 00:12:46,201
We got a crazy old laundress.
You know what happened to Frankovitch?

156
00:12:46,247 --> 00:12:49,912
He sent out his shorts and got back a girdle.

157
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:11,598
Ask her how much.

158
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,607
800 cigarettes, or coffee.

159
00:13:40,181 --> 00:13:44,130
No. This watch gold. Gold for teeth.

160
00:13:44,185 --> 00:13:46,474
- A watch from steel.
- How's this?

161
00:13:46,521 --> 00:13:49,191
No, this silver. Want steel.

162
00:13:49,232 --> 00:13:51,151
You want steel.

163
00:13:51,152 --> 00:13:55,444
No, want round watch, very big, nice face.

164
00:13:55,488 --> 00:13:59,439
You're tough. All right,
let's look in the other drawer.

165
00:14:01,412 --> 00:14:05,078
Mickey Mouse! Mickey Mouse!

166
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,200
- How much?
- $700.

167
00:14:08,253 --> 00:14:11,705
- You got three like this watch, maybe?
- We'll see.

168
00:14:21,058 --> 00:14:25,520
Herr Captain, buy porcelain?
Little Cupid to take for wife?

169
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:28,684
Never mind the knick-knacks.
How much for the mattress?

170
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:31,650
- Why you want the mattress?
- I'm sleepy.

171
00:14:31,694 --> 00:14:35,112
- How much for the mattress?

172
00:14:37,118 --> 00:14:39,406
What do you mean, "nein, nein, no"?

173
00:14:39,453 --> 00:14:41,494
Look what you can get for it.

174
00:14:46,129 --> 00:14:49,413
12 eggs in it and look at
the writing on it and the candles.

175
00:14:49,464 --> 00:14:53,000
The candles alone are worth the mattress.
Get lost.

176
00:16:52,848 --> 00:16:54,925
Yoo-hoo!

177
00:16:55,937 --> 00:16:58,806
Erika! Erika!

178
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:21,129
Sit down, Johnny.

179
00:17:26,135 --> 00:17:28,211
Go away, Johnny, sit down.

180
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,242
Johnny.

181
00:17:49,243 --> 00:17:51,700
Johnny, what are you doing?

182
00:17:51,747 --> 00:17:54,912
- I'm wiping my face.
- You're hurting me, Johnny.

183
00:17:54,957 --> 00:17:58,244
You're always hurting me.
Why are you so mean to me?

184
00:17:58,295 --> 00:18:01,629
I worry about you. I scrounge around,
I bring you presents

185
00:18:01,673 --> 00:18:03,424
and you tell me I'm mean to you.

186
00:18:03,425 --> 00:18:07,376
You brought me a present? Where is it?
Where have you got it?

187
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,553
Ohh...

188
00:18:09,598 --> 00:18:13,893
Johnny, they're so sheer. So beautiful.

189
00:18:13,937 --> 00:18:17,223
52 gauge. So I'm mean to you?

190
00:18:17,274 --> 00:18:20,560
- No, you're good to me.
- You bet I am.

191
00:18:20,611 --> 00:18:24,906
You don't know how good. I bought
you another present. You're not gonna get it.

192
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:28,233
Another one? Where have you got it?
Where is it, Johnny?

193
00:18:28,284 --> 00:18:31,239
- Keep away.
- Is it here? Tell me...

194
00:18:32,582 --> 00:18:36,994
Johnny...

195
00:18:37,044 --> 00:18:39,880
- Where did you get it?
- A friend of mine baked it.

196
00:18:39,922 --> 00:18:43,873
Only you're not going to get it. Why
should I care whether you sleep or not?

197
00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:47,972
Johnny, for 15 years
we haven't slept in Germany.

198
00:18:48,015 --> 00:18:51,550
First it was Hitler screaming on the radio,
then the war of nerves,

199
00:18:51,602 --> 00:18:53,891
then the victory celebrations,

200
00:18:53,938 --> 00:18:56,015
then the bombing.

201
00:18:56,066 --> 00:18:58,142
All the furniture burnt.

202
00:18:58,193 --> 00:19:00,193
See?

203
00:19:02,197 --> 00:19:05,649
That one I hate worst.
Give me that mattress, Johnny.

204
00:19:05,701 --> 00:19:07,777
No mattress will help you sleep.

205
00:19:07,828 --> 00:19:10,319
What you Germans need
is a better conscience.

206
00:19:10,373 --> 00:19:12,291
I have a good conscience.

207
00:19:12,292 --> 00:19:15,578
I have a new Führer now... you.

208
00:19:15,629 --> 00:19:17,004
Heil, Johnny.

209
00:19:17,005 --> 00:19:19,757
You heil me once more
and I'll knock your teeth in.

210
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,719
You'll bruise your lips.

211
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,005
Why don't I choke you a little?
Break you in two?

212
00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:28,684
Build a fire under you, you blonde witch.

213
00:19:30,271 --> 00:19:31,979
Who's that?

214
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,056
With my luck, it's Eisenhower.

215
00:19:43,325 --> 00:19:45,401
- Yes.
- Your name Schlütow?

216
00:19:45,453 --> 00:19:48,289
- I beg your pardon.
- Is your name Erika Schlütow?

217
00:19:48,331 --> 00:19:50,407
- No.
- You live here, don't you?

218
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:51,958
Yes, I live here.

219
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:54,878
You the dame that sings
at the Lorelei nightclub?

220
00:19:54,922 --> 00:19:58,670
- Yes, I sing there.
- And your name's not Erika Schlütow?

221
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:02,512
My name is Erika von Schlütow.

222
00:20:02,555 --> 00:20:04,631
- A von?
- She's a von.

223
00:20:04,682 --> 00:20:07,600
Nobility. We beg your highness's pardon.

224
00:20:07,644 --> 00:20:10,479
- What do you want?
- A little information.

225
00:20:10,522 --> 00:20:15,564
It says here that a certain Erika Schlütow...
von Schlütow, pardon I...

226
00:20:15,611 --> 00:20:18,896
has been an active von Nazi
ever since 19 - von - 35.

227
00:20:20,241 --> 00:20:22,317
Go on, gentlemen.

228
00:20:22,369 --> 00:20:25,738
It says that Miss von Schlütow
was ordered over a month ago

229
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:28,624
to a von labour camp
to pick up some von bricks.

230
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:31,953
- What else does it say?
- You're working at a night joint.

231
00:20:32,005 --> 00:20:35,669
According to this report,
what you're moving there ain't bricks.

232
00:20:35,716 --> 00:20:40,758
I'm an artist, gentlemen, not a street
cleaner, and I've been completely cleared.

233
00:20:40,805 --> 00:20:42,882
Yeah? Tell us all about it.

234
00:20:42,933 --> 00:20:46,467
My case has been reviewed
and the decision reversed.

235
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:48,809
I'm on the white list now.

236
00:20:49,689 --> 00:20:54,730
With that record? If you make the white list,
we'll make the hit parade.

237
00:20:54,777 --> 00:20:57,482
- OK, von sister, get your things on.
- What for?

238
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:01,066
We're taking you to
the von denazification office.

239
00:21:07,376 --> 00:21:10,211
Now, Abbot and Costello,
show me your orders.

240
00:21:10,254 --> 00:21:12,171
- Yes, sir.
- Who gave you these?

241
00:21:12,172 --> 00:21:14,247
- Lieutenant Clark, sir.
- Four weeks old.

242
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:16,217
We've had a lot of people to check.

243
00:21:16,218 --> 00:21:19,753
Paperwork, that's why we're always
fouled up when a war starts.

244
00:21:19,805 --> 00:21:23,341
Takes us six months to clear up
the paperwork from the last one.

245
00:21:23,392 --> 00:21:26,311
I'll talk to Clark.
This case is straightened out.

246
00:21:26,355 --> 00:21:29,107
- Sorry, sir.
- OK. That's all. Take off.

247
00:21:32,778 --> 00:21:35,898
- May I have that, please?
- Sorry.

248
00:21:38,784 --> 00:21:43,079
Take an ordinary guy, make him an MP,
suddenly he gets to be eight feet tall.

249
00:21:43,123 --> 00:21:47,073
- If they look into the files for my papers.
- Stop worrying. They're OK.

250
00:21:47,127 --> 00:21:51,078
- Goodbye. I got a desk full of work.
- Did the Colonel sign my papers?

251
00:21:51,132 --> 00:21:55,080
Not exactly. He was out of the office
having his tonsils swabbed.

252
00:21:55,134 --> 00:21:58,421
- The duty officer signed them.
- Who was the duty officer?

253
00:21:58,472 --> 00:22:00,181
I was.

254
00:22:00,182 --> 00:22:04,346
Johnny, if they find out you know me,
that's very dangerous.

255
00:22:04,395 --> 00:22:06,471
Everything is dangerous.

256
00:22:06,522 --> 00:22:11,185
I know an old lady back home,
broke her leg stepping into a church pew.

257
00:22:12,111 --> 00:22:14,111
See you, baby.

258
00:22:16,784 --> 00:22:20,071
Johnny! When you come back,
bring me some sugar.

259
00:22:20,122 --> 00:22:22,038
- Yeah, sure.
- And some soap.

260
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:24,117
And hairpins.

261
00:22:24,168 --> 00:22:28,118
- Anything else?
- A pillow to go with that mattress.

262
00:22:28,921 --> 00:22:31,591
Ah, you gorgeous booby trap.

263
00:22:32,969 --> 00:22:34,969
Yahoo!

264
00:22:39,976 --> 00:22:42,135
On your left is the Russian war memorial,

265
00:22:42,187 --> 00:22:45,639
built in honour of their soldiers
killed in the battle of Berlin.

266
00:22:45,691 --> 00:22:48,776
Those tanks on the side
were the first to enter Berlin.

267
00:22:49,738 --> 00:22:53,485
Beyond it, the Reichstag,
the German house of representatives.

268
00:22:53,533 --> 00:22:57,827
That's the building set on fire in 1933
and blamed on a poor Dutchman.

269
00:22:57,871 --> 00:23:00,705
The word got out it was Hitler
who threw the match.

270
00:23:00,748 --> 00:23:06,039
They used to say it's the first time in history
a man gave himself the hotfoot.

271
00:23:10,551 --> 00:23:15,593
The Brandenburg Gate, an arch of triumph
until they got out of the habit.

272
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,174
That rubble heap over there
was the American embassy.

273
00:23:19,227 --> 00:23:22,513
You can't tell now but this spot
was once the heart of Europe.

274
00:23:22,564 --> 00:23:24,853
The street is the famous Unter den Linden,

275
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,649
named after the linden trees,
which they've replanted now.

276
00:23:28,696 --> 00:23:31,448
That pile of stone over there
was the Adlon Hotel,

277
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:35,239
just after the 8th Air Force
checked in for the weekend.

278
00:23:35,287 --> 00:23:37,955
Now, let's look at the Wilhelmstraße.

279
00:23:39,624 --> 00:23:43,623
Here's the Reich Chancellery where
the Führer fixed himself up a duplex.

280
00:23:43,671 --> 00:23:47,965
As it turned out, one part got to be a big
padded cell and the other a mortuary.

281
00:23:48,008 --> 00:23:50,085
Underneath is a concrete basement,

282
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:53,718
where he married Eva Braun
and where they killed themselves.

283
00:23:53,764 --> 00:23:56,885
A lot of people say it was
the perfect honeymoon.

284
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:03,313
Over there is the balcony where he bet
his Reich would last a thousand years.

285
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,644
That's the one that broke
the bookies' hearts.

286
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:13,492
This is the Tiergarten,
used to be the Central Park of Berlin.

287
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:18,198
Those two big cement things are
the zoo bunkers, enormous pillboxes.

288
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:21,535
They were the last two buildings
in Berlin to surrender.

289
00:24:42,775 --> 00:24:46,524
I thought you'd be interested
in a typical Berlin residential area.

290
00:24:46,571 --> 00:24:49,859
If you look hard,
you'll see the houses are empty shells,

291
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:52,993
completely burned out by incendiaries.

292
00:24:53,037 --> 00:24:55,790
Life goes on in those ruins, though.

293
00:25:14,435 --> 00:25:17,472
That used to be
the largest department store in Berlin.

294
00:25:17,522 --> 00:25:22,814
It was 12 storeys high. Later on it became
headquarters for the storm troopers.

295
00:25:22,862 --> 00:25:28,153
They blew it up themselves.
The idea was to destroy all their records.

296
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,863
They overlooked the fact that most
of them were in fireproof vaults.

297
00:25:53,729 --> 00:25:55,729
Excuse me.

298
00:26:01,277 --> 00:26:03,277
Well.

299
00:26:03,905 --> 00:26:07,857
This is one of our youth clubs. We've
got a lot of them in the American zone.

300
00:26:07,911 --> 00:26:12,204
We had quite a problem. Those weren't
ordinary youngsters when we came in.

301
00:26:12,248 --> 00:26:16,627
They were mean old men. Now we're
trying to make kids of them again.

302
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:20,419
We had to kick the goose step out of them
and cure them of blind obedience

303
00:26:20,466 --> 00:26:22,624
and teach them to beep at the referee.

304
00:26:22,677 --> 00:26:25,427
If they want to steal,
make sure it's second base.

305
00:26:30,435 --> 00:26:34,385
One thing they don't have to worry about
round here, breaking windows.

306
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,891
One family has already
christened a kid DiMaggio Schultz.

307
00:26:37,943 --> 00:26:40,613
That's when I started believing
we'd won the war.

308
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:55,293
Hey, Fräulein! Hey, Fräulein!

309
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:00,758
Hey, Fräulein! Hey, Fräulein!

310
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:12,719
No, no, no.

311
00:27:12,772 --> 00:27:17,151
Come on. What's the matter with you two?
Just a little Spazierfahren in the park.

312
00:27:17,194 --> 00:27:21,026
Nein, we don't bicycle. We automobile.

313
00:27:21,575 --> 00:27:24,244
Automobile? You got yourselves officers?

314
00:27:24,286 --> 00:27:27,821
- French officers.

315
00:27:27,873 --> 00:27:31,622
OK. So they got an automobile
but we got the candy bar.

316
00:27:37,842 --> 00:27:40,463
Ah, your Führer's moustache.

317
00:27:46,726 --> 00:27:49,763
Hey, Doctor, I got a lady on the balcony.

318
00:27:51,064 --> 00:27:52,773
Size 14.

319
00:27:52,774 --> 00:27:55,231
Hey, Fräulein! Hey, Fräulein!

320
00:27:55,277 --> 00:27:59,857
Hey, Fräulein! Stop, Fräulein!

321
00:28:02,117 --> 00:28:04,953
- Guten afternoon, Fräulein.
- Hello, Fräulein.

322
00:28:06,915 --> 00:28:10,000
Das is my friend Brigadier General Mike.

323
00:28:10,044 --> 00:28:12,332
And das is mein Freund,
Lieutenant General Joe.

324
00:28:12,378 --> 00:28:13,755
Jawohl.

325
00:28:13,756 --> 00:28:16,211
You know, you're a nice little strudel.

326
00:28:16,257 --> 00:28:18,547
Hey, hands off. I saw her first.

327
00:28:19,721 --> 00:28:22,556
Fräulein, would you like
a little Spaßmachen,

328
00:28:22,598 --> 00:28:26,466
- Biertrinken and Tanzen making?
- Jawohl.

329
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:30,054
She must be tetched in the wool.
All she can say is, "Jawohl".

330
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,613
Fräulein, Fräulein, willst du ein candy bar

331
00:28:37,657 --> 00:28:41,951
Schön, fein Fräulein,
you like Gls, nicht wahr?

332
00:28:41,995 --> 00:28:44,071
At home though you won't believe us

333
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:46,198
The girls could take or leave us

334
00:28:46,249 --> 00:28:51,292
But here we squares is millionaires,
ach, du wunderbar candy bar

335
00:28:51,339 --> 00:28:54,457
Don't give her that candy bar yet.
Are you crazy?

336
00:28:54,507 --> 00:28:58,458
- I ain't giving. I'm just showing.
- Say, was ist your name?

337
00:29:01,808 --> 00:29:04,098
- Er, Gretchen.
- Gretchen what?

338
00:29:05,312 --> 00:29:08,597
- Gesundheit. Gretchen Gesundheit.
- Gesundheit!

339
00:29:08,648 --> 00:29:11,935
How do you like that?
We're fraternising with a sneeze.

340
00:29:11,986 --> 00:29:15,272
Gretchen, Gretchen...

341
00:30:01,456 --> 00:30:04,373
- I'm sorry. It's five packs now.
- Four packs.

342
00:30:04,417 --> 00:30:07,952
Five packs for champagne,
three for wine, one for beer.

343
00:30:08,004 --> 00:30:12,084
This is eine kleine clip joint. Here's your tip.

344
00:30:12,135 --> 00:30:16,298
How do you like these prices? We got
to write Congress to boost our PX ration.

345
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:21,009
Fat chance. All them schmoes think about
is coal strikes, flood control, United Nations.

346
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:24,809
What's Congress? A bunch of salesmen
with their foot in the right door.

347
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:27,811
For my dough, you can have
Congress and the Senate.

348
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,900
- I'll take it.
- You got it.

349
00:30:34,368 --> 00:30:36,368
Hey!

350
00:30:47,923 --> 00:30:50,593
What a bunch of cut-ups.

351
00:30:50,634 --> 00:30:54,799
Hey, Gretchen, you live with your mother?

352
00:30:54,848 --> 00:30:56,766
What business is it of yours?

353
00:30:56,767 --> 00:30:59,222
Look, what do you want, the whole family?

354
00:30:59,269 --> 00:31:02,473
You pulling a trick like the one
with the Schultz sisters?

355
00:31:02,523 --> 00:31:04,979
Nein, nein, you Soldaten, United States.

356
00:31:05,026 --> 00:31:07,101
Fry the uniformen.

357
00:31:26,674 --> 00:31:28,674
Shh!

358
00:31:30,553 --> 00:31:33,756
- Black market

359
00:31:33,806 --> 00:31:37,805
Sneak around the corner,
Budapesterstraße

360
00:31:37,853 --> 00:31:39,976
Black market

361
00:31:40,021 --> 00:31:42,311
Peek around the corner

362
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:49,898
Come, I'll show you things
you cannot get elsewhere

363
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:56,074
Come, make with the offers
and you'll get your share

364
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:59,622
Black market

365
00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:01,586
Eggs for statuettes

366
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:03,663
Smiles for cigarettes

367
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:07,124
Got some broken-down ideals?

368
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:11,088
Like wedding rings?

369
00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:13,808
Shh.

370
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:16,307
Tiptoe

371
00:32:16,352 --> 00:32:18,429
Trade your things

372
00:32:26,114 --> 00:32:31,156
I'll trade you for your candy

373
00:32:32,327 --> 00:32:36,278
Some gorgeous merchandise

374
00:32:37,834 --> 00:32:41,584
My camera, it's a dandy

375
00:32:43,132 --> 00:32:45,207
Six by nine

376
00:32:46,218 --> 00:32:48,295
Just your size

377
00:32:49,265 --> 00:32:53,926
You want my porcelain figure?

378
00:32:54,979 --> 00:32:59,272
A watch? A submarine?

379
00:32:59,316 --> 00:33:04,358
A Rembrandt? Salami?
Black lingerie from Wien?

380
00:33:04,405 --> 00:33:11,239
I sell my goods behind the screen

381
00:33:11,288 --> 00:33:14,989
No ceiling, no feeling

382
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:18,576
A very smooth routine

383
00:33:18,628 --> 00:33:20,917
You buy these goods

384
00:33:22,466 --> 00:33:28,090
And, boy, these goods are keen

385
00:33:40,778 --> 00:33:43,696
Black market

386
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:47,690
Laces for the missus,
chewing gum for kisses

387
00:33:47,744 --> 00:33:50,034
Black market

388
00:33:50,081 --> 00:33:52,156
Cuckoo clocks and bangles

389
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:54,960
Thousand little angles

390
00:33:55,002 --> 00:34:00,044
Come and see my little music box today

391
00:34:00,925 --> 00:34:02,843
Price?

392
00:34:02,844 --> 00:34:05,596
Only six cartons

393
00:34:05,638 --> 00:34:07,928
Want to hear it play?

394
00:34:07,975 --> 00:34:10,264
Black market

395
00:34:10,311 --> 00:34:13,478

00:34:14,524 --> 00:34:16,524
Browse around

397
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,649
I've got so many toys

398
00:34:21,447 --> 00:34:23,523
Don't be bashful

399
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:26,485
Step up, boys

400
00:34:33,543 --> 00:34:38,835
You'll like my first edition

401
00:34:38,882 --> 00:34:40,922
It's yours

402
00:34:40,968 --> 00:34:43,424
That's how I am

403
00:34:43,471 --> 00:34:47,220
A simple definition

404
00:34:47,266 --> 00:34:49,722
You take art

405
00:34:49,769 --> 00:34:52,225
I take Spam

406
00:34:52,272 --> 00:34:56,022
To you for your K ration

407
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:59,151
Compassion

408
00:34:59,198 --> 00:35:03,491
And maybe an inkling

409
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:07,699
A twinkling of real sympathy

410
00:35:07,747 --> 00:35:10,204
I'm selling out

411
00:35:10,251 --> 00:35:12,707
Take all I've got

412
00:35:12,754 --> 00:35:16,703
Ambitions, conviction, the works

413
00:35:18,008 --> 00:35:20,298
Why not?

414
00:35:20,345 --> 00:35:22,422
Enjoy these goods

415
00:35:23,808 --> 00:35:29,431
For, boy, these goods... are hot

416
00:35:45,706 --> 00:35:51,163
Boy, that's strudel. That's the kind of pastry
makes you drool on your bib.

417
00:35:51,212 --> 00:35:54,498
You know what they say?
She was up there with them big Nazis.

418
00:35:54,549 --> 00:35:58,843
Right in the major league.
She was Goebbels' girl or Göring's.

419
00:35:58,887 --> 00:36:02,423
- How did she get away with it?
- Just look at her.

420
00:36:02,475 --> 00:36:05,227
- She's hooked herself some big brass.
- Who?

421
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:09,515
All I know is, some big shot's
running interference for her.

422
00:36:13,361 --> 00:36:15,361
Jawohl.

423
00:36:15,947 --> 00:36:19,482
Listen, if anybody's dancing...
Come on, Gesundheit.

424
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:42,720
- What's the matter?
- Let go of me, you ape.

425
00:36:42,766 --> 00:36:45,720
- What kind of language...
- I said ape and I meant ape.

426
00:36:45,769 --> 00:36:47,769
Hey! Hey!

427
00:36:49,943 --> 00:36:52,647
- Where did you get that cake?
- Hey, Mike.

428
00:36:52,695 --> 00:36:54,771
I demand to know where you got that cake.

429
00:36:54,823 --> 00:36:56,898
What you want?

430
00:36:56,949 --> 00:37:00,236
Where'd this restaurant get food?
Our business, not yours.

431
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:02,288
I'm making it my business.

432
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:05,958
I happen to know all about that cake

433
00:37:06,002 --> 00:37:09,287
and I am a Congresswoman
of the United States of America.

434
00:37:09,921 --> 00:37:12,757
- Some strudel you picked.
- Yeah, let's go.

435
00:37:17,098 --> 00:37:19,386
Put back that slice of the cake.

436
00:37:19,433 --> 00:37:22,351
Take out the knife.
I want to know what it is doing here.

437
00:37:22,395 --> 00:37:24,683
- It is being eaten.
- That's enough.

438
00:37:24,729 --> 00:37:26,806
- This cake is confiscated.
- Hello.

439
00:37:26,857 --> 00:37:30,393
- How do you do? So that's where it is.
- What do you know about this?

440
00:37:30,445 --> 00:37:32,651
Very little. It was stolen out of my Jeep.

441
00:37:32,697 --> 00:37:35,734
- It was?
- Stolen and sold on the black market.

442
00:37:35,784 --> 00:37:38,453
They'll steal anything around here.

443
00:37:38,495 --> 00:37:42,244
- When I think of that girl back in Iowa...
- Yeah.

444
00:37:42,291 --> 00:37:44,961
I'll take care of this. Don't trouble yourself.

445
00:37:45,003 --> 00:37:49,296
Thank you. Will you also take care
of a pair of disgusting soldiers

446
00:37:49,339 --> 00:37:52,175
who should be stood up against a wall and...

447
00:37:53,219 --> 00:37:54,719
Oh.

448
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,968
I want you to find them.
They're medium height. One is a little taller.

449
00:37:59,017 --> 00:38:03,311
Their names are Mike and Joe and
they're in uniforms with US on the collar.

450
00:38:03,355 --> 00:38:04,730
Perfect sense, ma'am.

451
00:38:04,731 --> 00:38:07,354
Now, what exactly is
the name of this sewer?

452
00:38:07,402 --> 00:38:09,069
- The Lorelei.
- Address?

453
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:12,735
- Number 15, Hagenbachstraße.
- Are there other sewers like this?

454
00:38:12,782 --> 00:38:16,448
- Three or four but this is the best.
- What is the name of that woman?

455
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:18,329
- What woman?
- The singer here.

456
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:21,496
Oh, the singer. I think it's Erika.

457
00:38:21,541 --> 00:38:25,077
- Erika what?
- Erika von Schlütow.

458
00:38:25,129 --> 00:38:26,630
Why do you ask about her?

459
00:38:26,631 --> 00:38:31,293
Because there's something funny going on
here and I'm not in the mood for laughs.

460
00:38:31,344 --> 00:38:33,632
Schlütow? How do you spell it?

461
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:35,756
Schlütow, with an umlaut.

462
00:38:35,807 --> 00:38:37,884
I thought so.

463
00:38:41,313 --> 00:38:44,230
I want you to remember
that when we moved into Germany,

464
00:38:44,275 --> 00:38:47,312
we found a country of
open graves and closed hearts.

465
00:38:47,362 --> 00:38:50,280
We've tried to turn it into a civilised state.

466
00:38:50,324 --> 00:38:54,073
We had to eliminate things
that breed unrest and aggression.

467
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:57,404
We've tried to make them free men
and give them some dignity.

468
00:38:57,456 --> 00:39:01,406
We had to return four million
displaced persons to their homes.

469
00:39:01,461 --> 00:39:04,213
That's hard if you don't have
a home to start with.

470
00:39:04,255 --> 00:39:07,422
We had to repair hospitals
and public utilities.

471
00:39:07,467 --> 00:39:11,001
I remember the first day the gasworks
started operating again.

472
00:39:11,053 --> 00:39:14,588
There were 160 suicides in Berlin alone.

473
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,559
That was ten months ago.

474
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,855
Today, they take a match and light
the gas and boil some potatoes.

475
00:39:20,899 --> 00:39:24,647
Not many potatoes, mind you.
There is still a lot of hunger.

476
00:39:24,694 --> 00:39:26,901
But there is a new will to live.

477
00:39:26,946 --> 00:39:31,607
We had to build schools and find teachers
and then teach the teachers.

478
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:35,955
We helped them start a free press
and institute a parliamentary government.

479
00:39:35,997 --> 00:39:38,668
They had their first free election in 14 years.

480
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,248
It had been so long
they didn't know what to do.

481
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:44,580
It was like handing
the village drunk a glass of water.

482
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:50,296
What I want to point out is that
it's a tough, thankless, lonely job.

483
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:52,637
We're trying to lick it as well as we can.

484
00:39:52,683 --> 00:39:56,217
You might as well know,
some of us get out of line occasionally.

485
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:58,940
But remember this.
For the first time in history,

486
00:39:58,982 --> 00:40:03,808
you are asking the same generation of
soldiers to be both valorous and wise.

487
00:40:03,861 --> 00:40:05,779
- Mighty fine.
- Well said.

488
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:09,528
I sure hope our chairman has
made notes of that speech of yours.

489
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:12,327
I think it should be
incorporated in our report.

490
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:15,656
Colonel, we buy every word of it, all of us.

491
00:40:15,707 --> 00:40:17,707
I don't.

492
00:40:18,293 --> 00:40:22,920
I wouldn't think of buying it. I'm surprised
at my colleagues' low sales resistance.

493
00:40:22,965 --> 00:40:26,500
Miss Frost, this attitude calls
for some explanation.

494
00:40:26,552 --> 00:40:28,842
Colonel Plummer, in your eloquent speech,

495
00:40:28,889 --> 00:40:31,177
which I'm sure you've made 50 times,

496
00:40:31,224 --> 00:40:35,175
you used the phrase "Some of our boys
may get out of line sometimes."

497
00:40:35,229 --> 00:40:37,517
That is a masterpiece of understatement.

498
00:40:37,564 --> 00:40:39,191
What are you driving at?

499
00:40:39,192 --> 00:40:44,020
In your effort to civilise this country,
our boys are becoming barbarians.

500
00:40:44,072 --> 00:40:47,358
- I explained on that tour...
- I know all about those tours.

501
00:40:47,409 --> 00:40:51,988
You put blinkers on us and make sure
we only see what you want us to see.

502
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:55,788
Then you give us pamphlets,
statistics, a rousing speech

503
00:40:55,835 --> 00:40:58,954
and ship us back a little more
bamboozled than when we came.

504
00:40:59,004 --> 00:41:01,839
We could have learned
as much from Reader's Digest.

505
00:41:01,882 --> 00:41:05,418
- This is very embarrassing, Colonel.
- Go on, Miss Frost.

506
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:08,425
Well, I don't like blinkers.
I look in all directions

507
00:41:08,474 --> 00:41:13,099
and when I suspect dirt's been swept
under a carpet, I turn up that carpet.

508
00:41:13,144 --> 00:41:16,431
- What carpet? What dirt?
- What dirt?

509
00:41:16,483 --> 00:41:20,894
- One day and this is filled with it.
- Please particularise.

510
00:41:20,944 --> 00:41:23,781
Gls consorting with German Fräuleins...

511
00:41:23,823 --> 00:41:25,366
Fraternisation is legal.

512
00:41:25,367 --> 00:41:29,199
...in wide-open, shameless,
black-market nightclubs.

513
00:41:30,248 --> 00:41:34,198
So we close them and our boys sneak off
to places in the Russian sector,

514
00:41:34,252 --> 00:41:37,418
or the British, or in the French,
and there's another thing.

515
00:41:37,463 --> 00:41:40,630
This is off the record.
Those places attract a lot of scum

516
00:41:40,675 --> 00:41:44,425
and we clean it up by cracking down
with a surprise raid once in a while.

517
00:41:44,472 --> 00:41:48,765
Notorious Nazi entertainers parading
themselves before our boys,

518
00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:51,845
- is that off the record too?
- For instance?

519
00:41:51,895 --> 00:41:56,475
I am specifically referring
to one Erika von Schlütow,

520
00:41:56,526 --> 00:42:01,733
who works at a dive called the Lorelei,
15 Hagenbachstraße.

521
00:42:01,781 --> 00:42:03,781
How can a creature...

522
00:42:08,831 --> 00:42:11,502
I insist on a satisfactory explanation.

523
00:42:11,544 --> 00:42:15,492
I must ask the Congresswoman
to drop this particular matter.

524
00:42:15,547 --> 00:42:18,880
- Why?
- Some things must be left to our discretion.

525
00:42:18,925 --> 00:42:23,587
Colonel Plummer, I didn't go for
the blinkers. Now, don't try a muzzle.

526
00:42:23,638 --> 00:42:27,173
The last time someone wanted to gag me,
he tried it with a mink coat

527
00:42:27,225 --> 00:42:33,014
but I never let go until the president of that
particular ship company wound up in jail,

528
00:42:33,064 --> 00:42:36,185
even though I did get
pneumonia that winter.

529
00:42:38,821 --> 00:42:41,942
Herr Maier, this is the second time
we've had complaints.

530
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:45,408
I don't think it's a good idea
that your son... What's his name?

531
00:42:45,454 --> 00:42:46,579
Gerhard.

532
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:51,242
That Gerhard should draw swastikas
all over the neighbourhood.

533
00:42:53,754 --> 00:42:57,171
- I will break his arm.
- We've dissolved the Gestapo.

534
00:42:57,216 --> 00:43:01,879
No food, Bürschchen.
I will lock him into a dark room.

535
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:04,006
Why not just shove him in a gas chamber?

536
00:43:04,057 --> 00:43:05,182
Yes, Herr Kapitän.

537
00:43:05,183 --> 00:43:08,020
Listen, we've done away
with concentration camps.

538
00:43:08,062 --> 00:43:11,561
Take him round to a G YA,
one of our German youth clubs.

539
00:43:11,607 --> 00:43:15,356
Some baseball and a little less
heel-clicking is what he needs.

540
00:43:15,403 --> 00:43:17,692
Here's the address. Ask for Sergeant Breen.

541
00:43:17,739 --> 00:43:19,739
Yes, Herr Kapitän.

542
00:43:20,451 --> 00:43:23,368
I mean, thank you, Herr Kapitän.

543
00:43:23,412 --> 00:43:25,412
Auf Wiedersehen.

544
00:43:25,414 --> 00:43:27,490
Come, Bürschchen.

545
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:37,711
- Captain Pringle is wanted in 112.
- Who's that?

546
00:43:37,761 --> 00:43:40,430
That Congress dame,
whatever her name is.

547
00:43:40,472 --> 00:43:42,180
- Wants to see me?
- You, sir.

548
00:43:42,181 --> 00:43:44,471
- Now?
- Now. She's clucking like a hen.

549
00:43:44,518 --> 00:43:47,767
You'd better get there
before she lays an egg.

550
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:07,000
- Captain Pringle reporting.
- Hello.

551
00:44:07,836 --> 00:44:11,169
- Lorelei, how do you spell it?
- Lorelei?

552
00:44:11,214 --> 00:44:13,290
l-E or E-I at the end?

553
00:44:13,341 --> 00:44:15,050
E-I.

554
00:44:15,051 --> 00:44:17,051
Thank you.

555
00:44:19,473 --> 00:44:23,768
Captain Pringle, my belief in the army
has been shaken to the core.

556
00:44:23,812 --> 00:44:27,145
- Really?
- I can't trust anybody in uniform.

557
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:28,856
Now, please...

558
00:44:28,857 --> 00:44:31,527
With one single exception, you.

559
00:44:32,529 --> 00:44:33,737
Thank you, ma'am.

560
00:44:33,738 --> 00:44:36,026
I trust you because we're both Iowans.

561
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:39,822
- Right back at you, Miss Frost.
- Moreover, you're a hard worker.

562
00:44:39,869 --> 00:44:42,325
Perhaps you work too hard. You look tired.

563
00:44:42,372 --> 00:44:44,661
Well, I hoped it didn't show.

564
00:44:46,377 --> 00:44:48,833
That is ink, Captain Pringle.

565
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,213
So it is.

566
00:44:50,214 --> 00:44:51,798
Captain, I need your help.

567
00:44:51,799 --> 00:44:55,797
I want some additional data
on Fräulein von Schlütow.

568
00:44:55,845 --> 00:44:57,388
The one with the umlaut.

569
00:44:57,389 --> 00:45:01,172
- Oh, her.
- There must be a file on that woman.

570
00:45:01,226 --> 00:45:04,974
- Of course there is. Only it's not here.
- It isn't?

571
00:45:05,021 --> 00:45:07,774
I asked for it
and I was told it's gone to Nürnberg.

572
00:45:07,816 --> 00:45:11,103
On account of the trials,
a lot of files have been sent there.

573
00:45:11,154 --> 00:45:13,072
- I see.
- I asked around, though.

574
00:45:13,073 --> 00:45:16,026
- Did you find anything?
- Nothing important. Gossip.

575
00:45:16,075 --> 00:45:18,827
Are you sure? No fire with all that smoke?

576
00:45:18,869 --> 00:45:21,908
She may have known
a couple of minor party members.

577
00:45:21,958 --> 00:45:24,876
Nothing worth your attention.
Small fry, I'd say.

578
00:45:24,919 --> 00:45:27,671
- All right, ma'am, we're ready to go.
- Thank you.

579
00:45:27,714 --> 00:45:30,835
A warrant officer said he'd seen her
in an old newsreel,

580
00:45:30,885 --> 00:45:33,554
so I sent for the film from the Signal Corp.

581
00:45:37,933 --> 00:45:39,933
The Week In Pictures.

582
00:45:42,772 --> 00:45:46,056
This is a little Nazi get-together in Breslau.

583
00:45:51,614 --> 00:45:55,565
That's Goebbels telling them
how they're winning the war.

584
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:03,495
Opening of the opera with Lohengrin
and famous guests.

585
00:46:03,544 --> 00:46:06,036
They fiddled big while Berlin burned.

586
00:46:06,089 --> 00:46:08,876
Lohengrin, you know, swan song.

587
00:46:12,512 --> 00:46:17,389
Now we're getting someplace.
I wonder what holds up that dress.

588
00:46:17,435 --> 00:46:20,057
Must be that German willpower.

589
00:46:20,105 --> 00:46:22,643
Who's that man?
I think it's Birgel.

590
00:46:22,691 --> 00:46:25,264
Who?
Hans Otto Birgel.

591
00:46:25,318 --> 00:46:27,393
Who is Hans Otto Birgel?

592
00:46:27,446 --> 00:46:31,028
He had something to do
with the Gestapo. He's dead.

593
00:46:31,074 --> 00:46:36,995
- Killed himself when the Russians came.
- An important party member?

594
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:38,956
So-so.

595
00:46:38,957 --> 00:46:42,043
Well, she must be his girlfriend.

596
00:46:42,087 --> 00:46:44,839
Maybe she doesn't know him.
Maybe she had a dizzy spell

597
00:46:44,881 --> 00:46:47,882
and the first thing she could catch
was his... elbow.

598
00:47:14,412 --> 00:47:16,702
That's enough. Thank you.

599
00:47:18,959 --> 00:47:23,124
Well, we've learned one thing.
No small fry is she.

600
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:26,340
- I guess not.
- That a Nazi woman like that should...

601
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:29,670
I'll see she discontinues
her appearances as an entertainer.

602
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:32,010
- Will that be satisfactory?
- It will not.

603
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:34,728
What would you suggest, shave her head?

604
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:36,477
- I'm not after her head.
- Well?

605
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:40,228
It's common talk that an officer
in the army is protecting her.

606
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:43,810
- It's his head I'm after.
- You really think an officer?

607
00:47:43,862 --> 00:47:45,780
Incredible as it may seem.

608
00:47:45,781 --> 00:47:48,069
Now, let's use some common sense.

609
00:47:48,116 --> 00:47:51,865
That man is not giving her
his protection for platonic reasons.

610
00:47:51,912 --> 00:47:53,989
- Granted?
- Granted.

611
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,496
Of course the association is undercover.

612
00:47:56,543 --> 00:47:59,579
He's not stupid enough
to entertain her at his billet.

613
00:47:59,629 --> 00:48:03,578
- I guess that's right.
- We can therefore assume he visits her.

614
00:48:03,632 --> 00:48:05,709
Very logical.

615
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,295
Therefore, to catch him,
we must watch her place.

616
00:48:09,347 --> 00:48:11,264
Smart idea.

617
00:48:11,265 --> 00:48:14,101
- You know where she lives?
- I can find out.

618
00:48:14,143 --> 00:48:17,430
And I shall watch it
day and night... personally.

619
00:48:17,481 --> 00:48:20,151
No, we'll watch it together, the two of us.

620
00:48:20,192 --> 00:48:23,728
- We will?
- Yes. I want to be an eyewitness.

621
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:27,363
I want to see that man myself
and face him down.

622
00:48:27,409 --> 00:48:29,865
Can you afford the time, Miss Frost?

623
00:48:29,912 --> 00:48:33,660
Any time it requires.
This I intend to make my case in point.

624
00:48:33,707 --> 00:48:35,625
You'll go to the General?

625
00:48:35,626 --> 00:48:39,790
I will, and to the War Department
and to the President.

626
00:48:40,674 --> 00:48:43,960
And if that doesn't do it,
I'll see Gabriel Heater.

627
00:48:56,315 --> 00:48:59,851
It's well after curfew.
I wonder if he's coming tonight.

628
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:02,738
- He'll be here.
- Yeah?

629
00:49:02,781 --> 00:49:06,197
I don't think you understand
about arrangements like this.

630
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:08,911
They work 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.

631
00:49:08,953 --> 00:49:11,030
Does the CIO know about this?

632
00:49:14,335 --> 00:49:17,620
Are you sure there aren't
any back stairs to that apartment?

633
00:49:17,671 --> 00:49:19,381
There isn't even any back wall.

634
00:49:19,382 --> 00:49:22,502
She must be waiting for somebody.
Why leave the lights on?

635
00:49:22,553 --> 00:49:25,755
Maybe she's knitting
or putting up pickled peaches.

636
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:28,465
Only we know better.

637
00:49:33,272 --> 00:49:35,313
Pickled peaches.

638
00:49:36,526 --> 00:49:40,226
I bet you miss Iowa. I do already.

639
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:45,026
- It's changed since you've been there.
- Yeah?

640
00:49:45,077 --> 00:49:48,077
A lot has happened, especially in Murdoch.

641
00:49:48,122 --> 00:49:50,957
- Do you remember Union Street?
- Mm-hm.

642
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,662
Well, they've changed the name.
Now it's called Iwo Jima Boulevard.

643
00:49:55,713 --> 00:49:59,000
- That's news.
- And there was a post office scandal.

644
00:49:59,051 --> 00:50:02,800
- Yeah?
- About the new mural in the post office.

645
00:50:02,847 --> 00:50:05,516
The town collected $2,000 to hire a painter.

646
00:50:05,558 --> 00:50:08,844
The mayor got his cousin
from Chicago to do it.

647
00:50:08,895 --> 00:50:11,184
- That's nice.
- It was 80 feet long.

648
00:50:11,231 --> 00:50:13,231
Supposed to be Custer's last stand.

649
00:50:13,232 --> 00:50:16,981
After the cousin left town,
they found out it wasn't an original.

650
00:50:17,028 --> 00:50:19,779
He copied the whole thing from a beer ad.

651
00:50:19,822 --> 00:50:21,364
Hm.

652
00:50:21,365 --> 00:50:25,910
- There was an awful lot of trouble.
- You take Iowa seriously, don't you?

653
00:50:25,955 --> 00:50:28,410
Yes, I guess I do. I like it. Don't you?

654
00:50:28,457 --> 00:50:29,998
Mm-hm.

655
00:50:29,999 --> 00:50:33,536
We won a lot of honours last year,
all the 4H prizes.

656
00:50:33,588 --> 00:50:35,297
It's getting a little chilly.

657
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:38,833
We had the lowest juvenile delinquency rate
until two months ago.

658
00:50:38,886 --> 00:50:40,052
What happened?

659
00:50:40,053 --> 00:50:43,338
A boy in Des Moines took
a blowtorch to his grandmother.

660
00:50:43,389 --> 00:50:46,675
We fell clear down to 16th place.
It was humiliating.

661
00:50:58,407 --> 00:51:00,115
What's that?

662
00:51:00,116 --> 00:51:02,952
- Crickets.
- Something dropped.

663
00:51:02,995 --> 00:51:05,664
- How's that?
- Something metallic.

664
00:51:05,706 --> 00:51:07,706
Metallic?

665
00:51:13,215 --> 00:51:15,132
Look, it's a key.

666
00:51:15,133 --> 00:51:17,422
A key? Whatever for?

667
00:51:17,469 --> 00:51:20,756
Evidently the man honks the horn
and that's the signal.

668
00:51:20,807 --> 00:51:23,262
You know more about
these things than I do.

669
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:25,384
Johnny? Johnny?

670
00:51:30,358 --> 00:51:32,434
Where are you, Johnny?

671
00:51:33,276 --> 00:51:35,276
Johnny?

672
00:51:38,574 --> 00:51:41,860
- Johnny.
- There are a lot of Johnnys in the army.

673
00:51:41,911 --> 00:51:44,201
- Now we're getting someplace.
- Where?

674
00:51:44,248 --> 00:51:47,534
This eliminates all the Jims,
the Bobs and the Georges.

675
00:51:47,585 --> 00:51:49,661
Too bad his name isn't Zachary.

676
00:51:49,712 --> 00:51:51,789
Yes, that would simplify it.

677
00:52:06,856 --> 00:52:08,856
Johnny.

678
00:52:11,236 --> 00:52:14,355
I... don't know who you refer to.

679
00:52:14,405 --> 00:52:16,115
I am Captain Pringle

680
00:52:16,116 --> 00:52:20,410
and I have with me a member
of the Congress of the United States.

681
00:52:21,498 --> 00:52:23,416
Good evening.

682
00:52:23,417 --> 00:52:26,334
- You are Erika von Schlütow?
- I am.

683
00:52:26,378 --> 00:52:30,161
We have reason to believe you're
consorting with a member of our army.

684
00:52:30,215 --> 00:52:33,532
- You have?
- We think you're expecting him now.

685
00:52:33,533 --> 00:52:36,818
- What gives you that idea?
- The key you dropped.

686
00:52:38,413 --> 00:52:42,492
- Maybe I dropped it for the milkman.
- Oh.

687
00:52:42,543 --> 00:52:44,543
She dropped it for the milkman.

688
00:52:45,045 --> 00:52:48,999
Fräulein, if that's supposed to be a joke,
you're joking up the wrong tree.

689
00:52:49,049 --> 00:52:52,052
Let me assure you,
we are in no mood for flippancy.

690
00:52:52,096 --> 00:52:54,799
- Facts, if you please.
- Yes, facts.

691
00:52:56,682 --> 00:52:59,804
- You are an American woman?
- We'll ask the questions.

692
00:52:59,854 --> 00:53:02,313
- What is the name of the man?
- Yes.

693
00:53:02,357 --> 00:53:04,647
- Johnny.
- Johnny what?

694
00:53:04,697 --> 00:53:07,361
I see you do not believe in lipstick.

695
00:53:07,405 --> 00:53:11,152
And what a curious way to do your hair,
or rather not to do it.

696
00:53:11,202 --> 00:53:13,955
Wait a minute.
Do you know who you're taking to?

697
00:53:13,993 --> 00:53:18,660
An American woman, and I'm a little
disappointed, to tell you the truth.

698
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:22,539
We apparently have a false idea
about the chic American woman.

699
00:53:22,589 --> 00:53:27,463
- I suppose it's publicity from Hollywood.
- You're being impertinent.

700
00:53:27,513 --> 00:53:31,842
Well, I must go back now. There's
a curfew for German civilians, you know.

701
00:53:31,893 --> 00:53:33,768
There sure is.

702
00:53:33,769 --> 00:53:37,304
Fräulein von Schlütow,
we increased our national debt

703
00:53:37,354 --> 00:53:43,060
by some $350 billion to win this war.
I would regard it as a waste

704
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:46,645
- if we didn't eliminate types like you.
- Like you.

705
00:53:50,912 --> 00:53:55,573
Perhaps if you would change
the line of your eyebrows a little.

706
00:53:55,623 --> 00:53:57,700
Gute Nacht.

707
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:01,041
Gute Nacht,
Captain... whatever your name is.

708
00:54:05,677 --> 00:54:08,761
What nerve. What colossal nerve.

709
00:54:08,805 --> 00:54:12,096
We have to remember what
they've been through.

710
00:54:12,146 --> 00:54:15,311
All those bombings left them
kind of wobbly up here.

711
00:54:15,355 --> 00:54:18,277
- I do look awful without make-up.
- You don't.

712
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:21,436
We were only allowed 60lbs of luggage.
No nonessentials.

713
00:54:21,486 --> 00:54:26,066
Never listen to another woman if you want
to know how you look. Ask a man.

714
00:54:26,116 --> 00:54:28,575
- Come on, ask me.
- I know how I look.

715
00:54:28,619 --> 00:54:33,249
You look charming, positively,
definitely, absolutely charming...

716
00:54:33,292 --> 00:54:35,751
in a... refreshing sort of way.

717
00:54:35,795 --> 00:54:38,467
- Are you being polite?
- Who wants perfume?

718
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:43,171
Give me the fresh wet smell
of Iowa corn right after it rains.

719
00:54:43,221 --> 00:54:46,174
We had little rain this year,
wonderful corn weather.

720
00:54:46,225 --> 00:54:48,264
I'm sure glad to hear that.

721
00:54:49,103 --> 00:54:51,855
- Now to get back to that woman.
- Must we?

722
00:54:51,899 --> 00:54:54,934
To be as insulting as that,
she must feel awfully safe.

723
00:54:54,984 --> 00:54:56,697
Or just bluffing.

724
00:54:56,698 --> 00:54:59,982
The man behind her
must be really important.

725
00:55:00,033 --> 00:55:02,322
A general or a colonel.

726
00:55:02,366 --> 00:55:04,406
A colonel at least.

727
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:08,579
What's the full name of that colonel?

728
00:55:08,623 --> 00:55:11,293
- Colonel?
- That Colonel Plummer.

729
00:55:11,337 --> 00:55:13,250
- Rufus J Plummer.
- J for what?

730
00:55:13,251 --> 00:55:15,329
J for John.

731
00:55:15,385 --> 00:55:16,967
Do you think?

732
00:55:16,968 --> 00:55:21,260
No, not him. It couldn't be him.
He's a married man. A West Pointer.

733
00:55:21,303 --> 00:55:23,975
I've heard of married men,
of West Pointers, even.

734
00:55:24,019 --> 00:55:28,311
- But not Plummer, ma'am, I swear.
- There was a look in his eye.

735
00:55:28,355 --> 00:55:32,302
If we could only get our hands on her file.
Who told you it was sent to Nürnberg?

736
00:55:32,359 --> 00:55:36,938
- Second Lieutenant Cook, in charge of files.
- Maybe he's covering up for his colonel.

737
00:55:36,988 --> 00:55:40,824
- I'll ask him tomorrow morning.
- No. We'll go there now.

738
00:55:40,867 --> 00:55:42,581
- Where?
- To the files.

739
00:55:42,582 --> 00:55:45,497
In the middle of the night?
Shouldn't we get permission?

740
00:55:45,541 --> 00:55:49,076
Did we get permission
to land in Normandy? Let's go.

741
00:56:03,228 --> 00:56:06,144
Schlütow, Schlütow.

742
00:56:06,187 --> 00:56:08,265
S... SA...

743
00:56:12,325 --> 00:56:15,158
SCH to ST. This is where it would be.

744
00:56:15,202 --> 00:56:17,115
If it is at all, but I don't think it is.

745
00:56:17,116 --> 00:56:19,788
- Well, let's make good and sure.
- Sure.

746
00:56:21,371 --> 00:56:23,830
Come on, open it.

747
00:56:23,873 --> 00:56:27,627
Schlage, Schlangenberg,
Schlagenspitz, Schlitz...

748
00:56:27,671 --> 00:56:30,956
Seems that some of them
never got to Milwaukee.

749
00:56:31,844 --> 00:56:34,678
Schliemann, Schlüssel, Schlütow...

750
00:56:34,722 --> 00:56:36,799
- There.
- Here's the Schlütows.

751
00:56:36,849 --> 00:56:42,687
Anton, Emil, Fritz, Gottfried, Waldemar...

752
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:44,807
- No Erika.
- No Erika.

753
00:56:44,858 --> 00:56:48,023
Told you so. Gone to Nürnberg.
Gone to Nürnberg.

754
00:56:48,067 --> 00:56:50,357
I'll take you back to your billet.

755
00:56:51,327 --> 00:56:53,366
Erika von Schlütow.

756
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,330
- Yes?
- It's under von.

757
00:56:55,331 --> 00:56:56,831
Oh, no.

758
00:56:56,832 --> 00:57:00,367
Like O'Brien. You wouldn't
look under B, you'd look under O.

759
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:03,252
- All right, let's look under O.
- Under V.

760
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:09,420
- V as in vindictive.
- What was that, Captain?

761
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:11,548
I pity anybody who has you on his trail.

762
00:57:11,598 --> 00:57:14,882
You pity a man who's consorting
with a notorious Nazi?

763
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:16,646
Von Resnicek, von Reudesheim...

764
00:57:16,647 --> 00:57:19,930
Did it occur to you there might be
extenuating circumstances?

765
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:22,520
I expect any man in his country's uniform...

766
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:26,149
Oh, that one.
You expect him to be an ambassador.

767
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:29,947
A salesman of goodwill. You want him
to stand on the blackened rubble

768
00:57:29,991 --> 00:57:32,281
of what used to be the corner of a street

769
00:57:32,331 --> 00:57:34,614
with a sample case of assorted freedoms,

770
00:57:34,664 --> 00:57:36,873
waving the flag and the Bill of Rights.

771
00:57:36,917 --> 00:57:39,325
That's not the way it works.

772
00:57:39,375 --> 00:57:43,129
Suppose you stop and ask yourself
how come he skidded of the road?

773
00:57:43,173 --> 00:57:47,471
- I'll tell you how. No moral brakes.
- That's it, going too fast.

774
00:57:47,515 --> 00:57:49,968
During the war, he couldn't go fast enough.

775
00:57:50,018 --> 00:57:54,760
"Get on that beachhead, through the
tank traps, across the Rhine. Step on it."

776
00:57:54,810 --> 00:58:00,397
Faster, 100 miles an hour,
24 hours a day through burning towns.

777
00:58:00,441 --> 00:58:02,361
Then one day the war is over.

778
00:58:02,362 --> 00:58:05,484
You expect him to jam on those brakes
and stop like that.

779
00:58:05,534 --> 00:58:07,611
Everybody can't stop like that!

780
00:58:07,661 --> 00:58:11,953
Sometimes you skid, sometimes you go
into a spin and smash into a tree

781
00:58:11,997 --> 00:58:17,039
and bash your fenders and scrape those
fine ideals you brought from home.

782
00:58:17,089 --> 00:58:19,755
It's time such wrecks
were hauled into a garage.

783
00:58:19,798 --> 00:58:23,751
- Anyone who forgets he's American...
- Don't forget he's also human.

784
00:58:23,801 --> 00:58:25,879
What would you know about that?

785
00:58:27,724 --> 00:58:29,394
Von Schlegel, von Schlittenheim...

786
00:58:29,395 --> 00:58:33,937
The loneliness is stored up right down
to his boots and it's driving him crazy.

787
00:58:33,981 --> 00:58:36,896
One day a pair of
open-toed shoes come along.

788
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:41,270
You want him to ask questions?
Party affiliation? Social Security number?

789
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:44,823
Yes, I want him to make sure
he's not doing something subversive.

790
00:58:44,867 --> 00:58:49,165
Are you qualified to call the pitch on this?
What's your life, anyway?

791
00:58:49,209 --> 00:58:51,962
Committees and sessions
and adjournments

792
00:58:51,999 --> 00:58:54,076
and budget cuts and appropriations.

793
00:58:54,127 --> 00:58:57,962
What do you do for laughs? What do you
do for tears for that matter?

794
00:59:00,095 --> 00:59:04,387
For tears... for tears I cry, Captain Pringle.

795
00:59:04,431 --> 00:59:06,677
It may interest you to know
I once cried for a man

796
00:59:06,727 --> 00:59:08,886
till my eyes were
half washed out of my head.

797
00:59:08,936 --> 00:59:11,094
Not really.

798
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:15,943
I was on an important subcommittee.
One was a Southern Democrat.

799
00:59:15,987 --> 00:59:18,940
His convictions
were utterly different from mine.

800
00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:23,287
I hated everything he stood for.
I despised his politics.

801
00:59:23,331 --> 00:59:26,165
But I loved him... insanely.

802
00:59:27,372 --> 00:59:30,125
I loved the Southern syrup in his voice.

803
00:59:30,964 --> 00:59:33,416
His mint julep manners.

804
00:59:33,466 --> 00:59:37,001
The way he'd look at me
through his long thick eyelashes

805
00:59:37,051 --> 00:59:39,341
when I was vetoing an amendment.

806
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:45,341
He'd put his arm around me,
just kind of lazy, like.

807
00:59:46,774 --> 00:59:49,527
Lean his head against my cheek.

808
00:59:49,564 --> 00:59:53,099
His hair had a deep wave in it.

809
00:59:54,156 --> 00:59:57,823
- You know what he was trying to do?
- What?

810
00:59:58,867 --> 01:00:00,945
He was trying to sway my vote.

811
01:00:03,497 --> 01:00:06,782
Once he drove me home
from an all-night meeting,

812
01:00:06,838 --> 01:00:09,128
stopped his car on Earl Street.

813
01:00:09,172 --> 01:00:13,464
For no reason at all, he said,
except he was yearning for my lips.

814
01:00:14,928 --> 01:00:17,968
To tell you the truth, I was yearning for his.

815
01:00:19,395 --> 01:00:23,055
But it would have meant betraying
my platform and my constituents.

816
01:00:23,105 --> 01:00:25,395
- What did you do?
- I filibustered.

817
01:00:25,439 --> 01:00:27,896
- You what?
- I just kept on talking.

818
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:32,983
The constitution, the Bill of Rights, poems,
Longfellow, anything I could think of.

819
01:00:33,033 --> 01:00:37,325
Von Schloss, von Schlotzing,
von Schlumann, von Schlürmann,

820
01:00:37,369 --> 01:00:39,369
von...

821
01:00:42,167 --> 01:00:45,202
- No other man since the mint julep guy?
- No.

822
01:00:45,252 --> 01:00:47,923
- No more what you call yearning?
- No.

823
01:00:49,631 --> 01:00:52,303
- Sure?
- None of your business.

824
01:00:53,761 --> 01:00:58,509
I've been doing a little yearning
ever since you stepped off that plane.

825
01:00:59,523 --> 01:01:01,594
Captain Pringle!

826
01:01:03,064 --> 01:01:06,105
- Don't!
- Why not? You're not a Nazi.

827
01:01:06,155 --> 01:01:09,439
Don't tell me it's subversive
to kiss a Republican.

828
01:01:14,582 --> 01:01:16,496
I am a Congresswoman.

829
01:01:16,497 --> 01:01:20,451
Yeah. Now I know how I'll cast
my absentee ballot come re-election.

830
01:01:20,501 --> 01:01:24,336
- I'm here on official business.
- This is official.

831
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:27,170
Oh! Now, listen.

832
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:29,176
Listen.

833
01:01:29,177 --> 01:01:33,476
"Listen, my children, and you shall hear
of the midnight ride of Paul Revere

834
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:37,467
"On the 18th of April in '75,
hardly a man is now alive

835
01:01:37,524 --> 01:01:40,270
"Who remembers that famous day and year

836
01:01:41,065 --> 01:01:45,444
"He said to his friend, 'lf the British march
by land or sea from the town tonight

837
01:01:45,488 --> 01:01:50,531
"'Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch
of the North Church tower as a signal light

838
01:01:50,575 --> 01:01:53,033
"'One if by land and two if by sea

839
01:01:53,083 --> 01:01:57,244
"'And I on the opposite shore shall be
ready to ride and spread the alarm

840
01:01:57,294 --> 01:01:59,746
"'Through every Middlesex village and farm

841
01:01:59,797 --> 01:02:02,549
"'For the country folk to be up and to arm... '

842
01:02:04,176 --> 01:02:09,682
"Then he said 'Good night! '
and, with muffled oar, silent..." Oh!

843
01:02:14,024 --> 01:02:17,058
Now, Congresswoman,
may I have the floor?

844
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:20,687
You are entirely out of order.

845
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,814
Objection overruled.

846
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:47,758
Ooh. Oh.

847
01:02:47,808 --> 01:02:50,266
Just, er, checking up on Paul Revere.

848
01:02:51,687 --> 01:02:54,890
Oh, sure.

849
01:03:56,678 --> 01:04:00,425
This is where you live, Congresswoman.
This is your billet.

850
01:04:02,265 --> 01:04:05,224
I said we're here. What's the matter?

851
01:04:07,063 --> 01:04:10,348
- I just want to die.
- You what?

852
01:04:10,404 --> 01:04:13,070
It's awful. It never should have happened.

853
01:04:13,113 --> 01:04:16,148
Listen, you didn't burn down an orphanage.

854
01:04:16,198 --> 01:04:18,694
You got kissed in a file room. That's all.

855
01:04:18,744 --> 01:04:21,034
- I'm a thief.
- Thief?

856
01:04:21,078 --> 01:04:24,331
The lowest kind of a thief,
stealing another woman's man.

857
01:04:25,170 --> 01:04:26,251
Yeah?

858
01:04:26,252 --> 01:04:28,711
The cake I brought. The girl you left behind.

859
01:04:28,755 --> 01:04:31,758
She sent a love letter and you fell in love
with the postman.

860
01:04:31,802 --> 01:04:35,549
Those things happen, like electrons,
positive and negative.

861
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:38,883
- One day they get together and wham!
- No!

862
01:04:38,933 --> 01:04:40,684
No wham.

863
01:04:40,685 --> 01:04:43,850
- We've got to get control of ourselves.
- Can we?

864
01:04:43,901 --> 01:04:46,353
It would be wiser
not to see each other again.

865
01:04:46,403 --> 01:04:50,564
- I suppose it would.
- We can't go on with our investigation.

866
01:04:50,614 --> 01:04:53,898
- So we drop it.
- No. No, I'll go on alone.

867
01:04:54,949 --> 01:04:58,071
- I could enlist the help of the general.
- No.

868
01:04:58,121 --> 01:04:59,622
Why not?

869
01:04:59,623 --> 01:05:04,916
Miss Frost, Congresswoman,
Postman, darling,

870
01:05:04,966 --> 01:05:08,914
to know that you're here and around
and I couldn't see you, I'd go crazy.

871
01:05:08,970 --> 01:05:10,633
We've got to be strong.

872
01:05:10,634 --> 01:05:15,383
This business about Dusty, it's not serious.
It's just a college crush.

873
01:05:15,433 --> 01:05:18,718
- I have a dreadful sense of guilt.
- We're not engaged.

874
01:05:18,768 --> 01:05:21,521
I'm not committed in any way.

875
01:05:21,564 --> 01:05:26,726
It would break her heart, the daughter of
the man who swung the 4th Precinct.

876
01:05:26,782 --> 01:05:30,317
No, it won't.
She's a kind of a flighty kid, you know.

877
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:33,320
She's been engaged to four guys
since I've been gone,

878
01:05:33,370 --> 01:05:35,829
one of them a feed and grain merchant.

879
01:05:35,873 --> 01:05:38,582
Think what a good provider he'd make.

880
01:05:38,626 --> 01:05:40,626
Oh, John...

881
01:05:41,091 --> 01:05:45,038
I don't even know your first name,
Congresswoman darling.

882
01:05:45,094 --> 01:05:47,165
- Phoebe.
- Phoebe.

883
01:05:47,221 --> 01:05:49,135
Isn't that ridiculous?

884
01:05:49,136 --> 01:05:51,213
Not a bit ridiculous.

885
01:05:53,227 --> 01:05:55,980
How about a good-night kiss, Phoebe?

886
01:05:58,107 --> 01:06:00,147
Good night.

887
01:06:04,157 --> 01:06:06,197
Good morning.

888
01:06:10,289 --> 01:06:12,579
Good evening.

889
01:06:17,252 --> 01:06:19,329
Good gracious.

890
01:06:27,388 --> 01:06:33,181
The problem is how to stop
all this physical human contact...

891
01:06:36,485 --> 01:06:40,351
We just ought to put our foot down
and put it down hard.

892
01:06:40,407 --> 01:06:42,691
- Why, Miss Frost.
- Where have you been?

893
01:06:42,741 --> 01:06:45,655
- We've been worried.
- Won't you join us?

894
01:06:45,699 --> 01:06:47,699
- Miss Frost?
- Miss Frost?

895
01:07:15,317 --> 01:07:17,395
Anything I can do for you?

896
01:07:18,446 --> 01:07:20,523
Not a thing.

897
01:07:23,075 --> 01:07:27,029
Hah...

898
01:07:43,434 --> 01:07:48,476
- Hans Otto Birgel.
- That's the best we could find, Colonel.

899
01:07:48,519 --> 01:07:51,892
The others without uniform
don't show his face so plainly.

900
01:07:51,942 --> 01:07:55,896
Lovely master race type.
I bet he never tortured anybody.

901
01:07:55,946 --> 01:07:58,986
Not until he made sure
his dachshund had had his dinner.

902
01:07:59,037 --> 01:08:01,489
I want every MP to memorise this puss.

903
01:08:05,875 --> 01:08:09,829
Have 100 copies printed. Send it around
with a detailed description.

904
01:08:09,879 --> 01:08:11,173
Will do.

905
01:08:11,174 --> 01:08:13,927
We've got the trap baited
with the right cheese.

906
01:08:13,971 --> 01:08:16,254
He'll snap at it, sure as shooting.

907
01:08:17,387 --> 01:08:19,677
- I hope.

908
01:08:19,727 --> 01:08:22,179
Come in.

909
01:08:22,229 --> 01:08:24,895
- You wanted to see me, Colonel?
- Yes, Miss Frost.

910
01:08:24,938 --> 01:08:27,228
- That'll be all, Major.
- Yes, sir.

911
01:08:28,317 --> 01:08:30,776
- How is the investigation going?
- The what?

912
01:08:30,819 --> 01:08:33,109
- The investigation.
- Oh, fine.

913
01:08:33,159 --> 01:08:36,075
- Making any progress?
- Slowly. Why?

914
01:08:36,913 --> 01:08:39,747
It seems, in the course of it,
you lost something.

915
01:08:39,791 --> 01:08:42,244
- I have?
- This is yours, isn't it?

916
01:08:43,332 --> 01:08:47,630
Yes, thank you very much.
Well, I guess I'd better get some hatpins.

917
01:08:47,674 --> 01:08:51,421
It is pretty windy in Berlin,
especially at night.

918
01:08:54,055 --> 01:08:57,339
Well, the whole thing
can be easily explained.

919
01:09:03,271 --> 01:09:08,313
But I hardly think you're in a position
to cast a stone, Colonel Plummer.

920
01:09:08,363 --> 01:09:11,485
- I'm very sorry.
- I think you're brazen.

921
01:09:11,535 --> 01:09:12,786
Am I?

922
01:09:12,787 --> 01:09:16,484
- Having that on your desk.
- Having what on my desk?

923
01:09:16,541 --> 01:09:21,083
I know all about that going
100 miles an hour, then the war is over

924
01:09:21,127 --> 01:09:23,416
but you can't stop like that.

925
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:25,919
But there is such a thing as discretion.

926
01:09:26,757 --> 01:09:30,211
- What discretion?
- Is this your family?

927
01:09:30,261 --> 01:09:33,183
Yes, and this is our house in Indiana.

928
01:09:33,227 --> 01:09:35,679
- How long have you been married?
- 22 years.

929
01:09:35,729 --> 01:09:39,264
Oh, no. Perhaps it would be a good idea
if you sent for your wife.

930
01:09:39,314 --> 01:09:41,773
She can't come now.
We're expecting a baby.

931
01:09:41,817 --> 01:09:44,770
- A baby?
- I mean, our older daughter is.

932
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:49,568
I can understand the temptation of
a young man over here but a grandfather...

933
01:09:49,619 --> 01:09:53,565
Really, Colonel Plummer,
you should have your brakes relined.

934
01:10:15,231 --> 01:10:17,309
John. John, now I know.

935
01:10:17,359 --> 01:10:19,649
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

936
01:10:19,692 --> 01:10:22,151
- I found out. There can't be any doubt.
- What?

937
01:10:22,195 --> 01:10:24,115
- He even has her picture.
- Who?

938
01:10:24,116 --> 01:10:25,698
- Colonel Plummer.
- Whose?

939
01:10:25,699 --> 01:10:27,699
- That woman's.
- How come?

940
01:10:27,744 --> 01:10:29,822
I mean, what for?

941
01:10:29,872 --> 01:10:32,543
To look at. He can't keep his eyes off her.

942
01:10:32,581 --> 01:10:36,116
It must be a mistake.
Maybe it's somebody who looks like her.

943
01:10:36,172 --> 01:10:38,211
Should I talk it over with the general?

944
01:10:38,255 --> 01:10:41,258
- I wouldn't. Not the general.

945
01:10:41,302 --> 01:10:45,594
Excuse me. Denazification office,
Captain Pringle speaking.

946
01:10:46,476 --> 01:10:49,761
- Who?
- Johnny, what has happened?

947
01:10:49,811 --> 01:10:53,096
Why didn't you come last night?
I waited for you.

948
01:10:53,146 --> 01:10:55,435
Johnny, are you listening?

949
01:10:55,486 --> 01:11:00,821
Of course I am, Lieutenant... Forrestal.

950
01:11:00,865 --> 01:11:03,155
Lieutenant Forrestal, quartermasters.

951
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:07,860
Well, Lieutenant, I'm sorry I couldn't
make it. I'm pretty busy these days.

952
01:11:07,916 --> 01:11:13,622
Johnny, what's the matter?
This is Erika. How you talk to me!

953
01:11:13,672 --> 01:11:17,801
Lieutenant, it should not be
too difficult to grasp the situation.

954
01:11:17,839 --> 01:11:20,298
I wonder how he got through officers school.

955
01:11:21,474 --> 01:11:23,545
Oh, someone is with you, is that it?

956
01:11:23,601 --> 01:11:25,885
That is correct, Lieutenant Forrestal.

957
01:11:25,935 --> 01:11:29,432
Is this the son of the secretary of the Navy?
Let me speak with him.

958
01:11:29,482 --> 01:11:33,430
No, this is the army Forrestal,
absolutely no relation.

959
01:11:34,275 --> 01:11:38,229
Lieutenant, I assure you
I'll see you as soon as it's practical.

960
01:11:38,285 --> 01:11:41,238
It may be late,
possibly after your office hours.

961
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:47,163
- I miss you so, Johnny. I love you.
- I'll make a note of that.

962
01:11:47,207 --> 01:11:49,284
Goodbye, Lieutenant.

963
01:11:49,334 --> 01:11:52,625
Nice kid. We went through
basic training together.

964
01:11:54,258 --> 01:11:56,385
Now, what am I to do about the Colonel?

965
01:11:56,429 --> 01:12:00,175
- I don't know.
- Could he be transferred to Japan?

966
01:12:00,225 --> 01:12:04,173
I don't think so, not Japan.
Not with Tokyo Rose around.

967
01:12:04,229 --> 01:12:07,314
- What do you suggest?
- What do I suggest?

968
01:12:07,358 --> 01:12:10,273
- What do I suggest? Come on!
- Where are you taking me?

969
01:12:10,317 --> 01:12:12,989
Brent, take over for me.
I won't be back today.

970
01:12:13,026 --> 01:12:16,198
Where are you taking me?
We have a meeting with the general.

971
01:12:16,242 --> 01:12:19,990
You don't want to see the general,
you want to see me. I want to see you.

972
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:23,324
So little time, so much to say.
Don't let's waste a minute.

973
01:12:23,374 --> 01:12:26,290
- My investigation...
- I'll handle it after you go.

974
01:12:26,334 --> 01:12:29,005
Send you a full report to Washington.

975
01:12:29,049 --> 01:12:32,334
These few days are ours.
They're all we've got.

976
01:12:32,384 --> 01:12:34,260
You dreadful man.

977
01:12:34,261 --> 01:12:37,095
Come on. Let's get the Jeep
and drive out to Wannsee.

978
01:12:37,139 --> 01:12:42,431
It's wide and green and I know a spot
that looks like a bend in the Mississippi.

979
01:12:42,482 --> 01:12:44,482
Let's.

980
01:13:01,958 --> 01:13:04,797
Johnny, come on.

981
01:13:04,835 --> 01:13:07,588
- Faster. Faster.
- Hi.

982
01:13:07,631 --> 01:13:12,380
Two days and two nights, what has
mein kleiner Liebling being doing?

983
01:13:13,387 --> 01:13:16,309
He's been making charm
with the bloodhounds.

984
01:13:16,353 --> 01:13:18,674
How are things going
with the Congresswoman?

985
01:13:18,730 --> 01:13:21,727
- All right. We're engaged.
- You're what?

986
01:13:21,771 --> 01:13:24,230
Better than having my head chopped off.

987
01:13:24,274 --> 01:13:28,322
- I didn't know you were that deep in.
- What deep? How deep?

988
01:13:28,365 --> 01:13:31,237
Why didn't you tell me
you and Birgel were like that?

989
01:13:31,287 --> 01:13:34,034
- He's dead.
- Having your hand kissed by Hitler.

990
01:13:34,078 --> 01:13:35,997
I hope you had it sterilised.

991
01:13:35,998 --> 01:13:38,751
Looked as if he had rat poison
in that moustache.

992
01:13:38,795 --> 01:13:40,795
Don't talk like that.

993
01:13:41,504 --> 01:13:45,252
Why not?
How much of a Nazi were you, anyway?

994
01:13:45,302 --> 01:13:48,586
Johnny, what does it matter,
a woman's politics?

995
01:13:48,636 --> 01:13:52,935
Women pick out whatever's in fashion
and change it like a spring hat.

996
01:13:52,978 --> 01:13:58,015
Yeah. Last year it was
a little number with a swastika on it.

997
01:13:58,065 --> 01:14:02,013
This year it's ostrich feathers,
red, white and blue.

998
01:14:02,069 --> 01:14:04,559
Next year a hammer, maybe, and a sickle.

999
01:14:05,365 --> 01:14:09,576
Oh, Johnny, we must not say
mean words to each other.

1000
01:14:10,577 --> 01:14:14,875
When you say you are engaged,
that is only until her plane leaves, huh?

1001
01:14:14,919 --> 01:14:16,990
What else?

1002
01:14:17,046 --> 01:14:19,498
- I love you so very much.
- You do?

1003
01:14:19,549 --> 01:14:22,383
You're the only man I ever wanted to marry.

1004
01:14:24,635 --> 01:14:26,712
That's mighty white of you.

1005
01:14:27,557 --> 01:14:32,387
I want to go with you to America.
I want to climb up the Statue of Liberty.

1006
01:14:32,437 --> 01:14:35,603
You want to get down
that basement at Fort Knox.

1007
01:14:35,646 --> 01:14:38,105
I want to be where you are.

1008
01:14:38,149 --> 01:14:42,447
Yeah, I can just imagine you
in Iowa in blue jeans,

1009
01:14:42,491 --> 01:14:44,781
going on a hay ride to the old mill.

1010
01:14:44,825 --> 01:14:46,902
I would love that.

1011
01:14:48,203 --> 01:14:51,288
Mmm, gently, baby, it's Mother's Day.

1012
01:14:52,752 --> 01:14:55,204
Cut it out, you blonde flamethrower.

1013
01:14:56,130 --> 01:14:58,130
Cut it out, I said.

1014
01:15:02,261 --> 01:15:04,933
Did you ever kiss the Congresswoman?

1015
01:15:04,970 --> 01:15:06,970
Sure I did.

1016
01:15:07,767 --> 01:15:11,301
- Did she kiss you?
- What kind of a question is that?

1017
01:15:11,357 --> 01:15:16,400
It's a very important question. What
do you do when you're alone together?

1018
01:15:16,444 --> 01:15:21,781
Oh... we sit, hold hands...

1019
01:15:23,245 --> 01:15:26,861
- whistle Shine On Harvest Moon.

1020
01:15:26,917 --> 01:15:29,582
- What's so funny?
- You hold hands?

1021
01:15:29,626 --> 01:15:31,747
Sure. Nice people do, you know.

1022
01:15:33,799 --> 01:15:36,915
You're so naive, you Americans.

1023
01:15:36,965 --> 01:15:39,255
So we are. So what of it?

1024
01:15:39,305 --> 01:15:44,348
That funny little woman with a face
like a scrubbed kitchen floor.

1025
01:15:44,391 --> 01:15:46,391
Yeah?

1026
01:15:50,147 --> 01:15:54,101
I have some vodka from the Russian sector
and I had the phonograph fixed.

1027
01:15:54,151 --> 01:15:56,992
- Would you like to hear some music?
- No thanks.

1028
01:15:57,029 --> 01:15:59,701
- Thanks a lot but no thanks.
- You're going?

1029
01:15:59,745 --> 01:16:03,905
- I got an early formation.
- You'll come back tomorrow night?

1030
01:16:03,955 --> 01:16:06,877
I imagine so, sterling character that I am.

1031
01:16:07,753 --> 01:16:09,753
So long.

1032
01:16:26,897 --> 01:16:29,606
- Miss Frost?
- Miss Frost?

1033
01:16:30,651 --> 01:16:33,942
- We're waiting for you.
- Dinner, Miss Frost.

1034
01:16:33,992 --> 01:16:36,657
- Did you call me?
- It's a quarter of eight.

1035
01:16:36,701 --> 01:16:39,372
We're going to the officers' mess for dinner.

1036
01:16:39,410 --> 01:16:42,250
I was sort of planning on a quiet evening.

1037
01:16:42,294 --> 01:16:44,170
Don't you feel well, Miss Frost?

1038
01:16:44,171 --> 01:16:47,456
I feel fine.
I have a kind of a headache, that's all.

1039
01:16:47,506 --> 01:16:49,795
Would you make
my excuses to the colonel?

1040
01:16:49,839 --> 01:16:52,761
- Sure will.
- Shall we bring you a sandwich maybe?

1041
01:16:52,805 --> 01:16:54,882
Cheese? Chicken? Ham?

1042
01:16:54,932 --> 01:16:58,974
Anything. Thank you very much.
Good evening, gentlemen.

1043
01:16:59,017 --> 01:17:01,057
Maybe we shouldn't leave her alone.

1044
01:17:01,107 --> 01:17:05,318
Maybe we should take her temperature.
Quite a lot of typhoid fever in Berlin.

1045
01:17:09,241 --> 01:17:12,607
Oh, good evening. I came to see Miss Frost.

1046
01:17:12,657 --> 01:17:14,733
Go on in. We're going out.

1047
01:17:15,953 --> 01:17:18,956
One might suspect
Cupid had a hand in this.

1048
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,947
If we didn't know Miss Frost.
You can't shoot an arrow through steel.

1049
01:17:24,174 --> 01:17:26,576
Phoebe... Phoebe!

1050
01:17:36,017 --> 01:17:38,057
Coming, John.

1051
01:18:04,928 --> 01:18:06,928
Well!

1052
01:18:09,433 --> 01:18:12,267
- Do I look all right?
- Where did you get it?

1053
01:18:12,311 --> 01:18:16,059
- At the Brandenburg Gate.
- The black market? You didn't.

1054
01:18:16,109 --> 01:18:20,399
Well, I did. All I wanted was a lipstick
and something for my eyebrows

1055
01:18:20,443 --> 01:18:23,565
but a woman had this over
the handlebars of her bicycle

1056
01:18:23,615 --> 01:18:26,068
and I gave her my typewriter for it.

1057
01:18:26,118 --> 01:18:28,783
The shoes were six extra typewriter ribbons.

1058
01:18:28,827 --> 01:18:31,498
- Phoebe, for the love of Mike.
- Don't scold me.

1059
01:18:31,536 --> 01:18:33,995
I know I shouldn't have but I simply had to.

1060
01:18:34,045 --> 01:18:39,081
This is our last evening and I wanted
to look so pretty and I look just awful.

1061
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:44,174
It's like a circus tent in mourning
for an elephant that died.

1062
01:18:44,218 --> 01:18:47,058
- It's no such thing.
- I'm not blind.

1063
01:18:47,096 --> 01:18:51,050
I tried to fix it but maybe
I'd better go up and put my suit on.

1064
01:18:51,938 --> 01:18:56,149
It is kind of high. What is it,
a turtleneck evening gown?

1065
01:18:56,193 --> 01:19:00,353
Well, it was a little lower but I fixed it.

1066
01:19:00,403 --> 01:19:02,443
You sure did.

1067
01:19:02,493 --> 01:19:06,785
Now, we takes this pin from here,
where it's just in the way,

1068
01:19:06,829 --> 01:19:09,913
and put it back here
where it can earn its pay.

1069
01:19:09,957 --> 01:19:12,034
It looked so lovely on the bicycle.

1070
01:19:12,084 --> 01:19:16,038
Now, stop it. You dressed for me
and to me you look good.

1071
01:19:16,088 --> 01:19:19,836
John, where did you learn
so much about women's clothes?

1072
01:19:19,886 --> 01:19:22,344
My mother wore women's clothes.

1073
01:19:22,387 --> 01:19:26,848
Oh, John, you're simply adorable.
Do you know it?

1074
01:19:26,892 --> 01:19:29,645
Who am I to argue with a Congresswoman?

1075
01:19:29,689 --> 01:19:31,979
You've got too much junk on your mouth.

1076
01:19:32,022 --> 01:19:34,100
- Have I?
- Now, hold still.

1077
01:19:36,490 --> 01:19:38,560
Now... we're in business.

1078
01:19:40,656 --> 01:19:42,656
We forgot your sable.

1079
01:19:42,702 --> 01:19:44,702
Oh...

1080
01:19:47,457 --> 01:19:50,498
You'll be quite a thing at that officers' mess.

1081
01:19:50,548 --> 01:19:53,664
- I don't want to go there.
- Where do you want to eat?

1082
01:19:53,714 --> 01:19:55,791
I thought some civilian place.

1083
01:19:55,841 --> 01:19:57,341
In Berlin?

1084
01:19:57,342 --> 01:20:01,296
The place where that singer...
You know, that place.

1085
01:20:01,347 --> 01:20:03,843
- You don't want to go to that sewer.
- Yes, I do.

1086
01:20:03,893 --> 01:20:06,564
I want it dark and gay and with music.

1087
01:20:07,397 --> 01:20:13,234
Want to buy some illusions slightly used?

1088
01:20:13,278 --> 01:20:15,405
Second-hand

1089
01:20:16,450 --> 01:20:22,074
They were lovely illusions, reaching high

1090
01:20:22,124 --> 01:20:24,576
Built on sand

1091
01:20:25,627 --> 01:20:29,919
They had a touch of paradise

1092
01:20:29,963 --> 01:20:34,261
A spell you can't explain

1093
01:20:35,262 --> 01:20:39,554
For in this crazy paradise

1094
01:20:39,597 --> 01:20:43,896
You are in love with pain

1095
01:20:45,479 --> 01:20:51,522
Want to buy some illusions slightly used?

1096
01:20:51,572 --> 01:20:53,693
Just like new

1097
01:20:55,577 --> 01:20:59,524
Such romantic illusions

1098
01:20:59,581 --> 01:21:03,873
And they're all about you

1099
01:21:05,299 --> 01:21:09,960
I'd sell them all for a penny

1100
01:21:10,010 --> 01:21:14,302
They make pretty souvenirs

1101
01:21:15,810 --> 01:21:19,758
Take my lovely illusions

1102
01:21:19,814 --> 01:21:22,267
Some for laughs

1103
01:21:23,568 --> 01:21:28,610
Some for tears

1104
01:21:35,536 --> 01:21:39,070
- Look, it's a hollow bottle.
- That's where the profit is.

1105
01:21:39,127 --> 01:21:41,792
There should be
a Congressional investigation.

1106
01:21:41,836 --> 01:21:45,371
- Second the motion.
- Let's investigate another bottle first.

1107
01:21:45,427 --> 01:21:47,427
- More champagne.
- Jawohl.

1108
01:21:48,261 --> 01:21:50,301
Hold my hand, John.

1109
01:21:51,596 --> 01:21:53,596
Sure.

1110
01:21:54,518 --> 01:21:56,889
Oh, John...

1111
01:21:56,939 --> 01:21:58,978
I'm so happy, I'm in heaven.

1112
01:22:00,192 --> 01:22:02,401
Not that I was unhappy before.

1113
01:22:02,445 --> 01:22:04,445
I was just drifting.

1114
01:22:04,447 --> 01:22:08,488
That's it. Drifting on a grey sea all alone.

1115
01:22:08,532 --> 01:22:10,991
It's not bad but suddenly you get scared.

1116
01:22:11,035 --> 01:22:15,865
You need another voice,
so you hoist up your heart and you wait

1117
01:22:15,915 --> 01:22:19,206
and nobody passes by, just grey waves.

1118
01:22:19,256 --> 01:22:23,835
Your heart gets frayed,
lashed by the night winds and rain.

1119
01:22:23,885 --> 01:22:28,547
So you haul it down, what's left of it,
and you resign yourself...

1120
01:22:29,559 --> 01:22:33,307
Then suddenly out of nowhere
comes a boat so unexpected,

1121
01:22:33,350 --> 01:22:36,103
all white sails on the horizon.

1122
01:22:36,147 --> 01:22:38,606
To you, my beautiful boat.

1123
01:22:40,114 --> 01:22:42,397
Phoebe, you make me feel awful.

1124
01:22:42,447 --> 01:22:46,489
Well, you are beautiful and you're fun
and you're good to me.

1125
01:22:46,533 --> 01:22:50,036
Stop it. I'm not that good.
Some day you may find...

1126
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:52,201
You talk an awful lot for a boat.

1127
01:22:53,709 --> 01:22:55,709
To us.

1128
01:23:09,394 --> 01:23:15,062
Want to buy some illusions slightly used?

1129
01:23:15,106 --> 01:23:18,397
Just like new

1130
01:23:18,447 --> 01:23:21,863
Such romantic illusions

1131
01:23:21,907 --> 01:23:26,574
And they're all about you

1132
01:23:27,413 --> 01:23:32,080
I'd sell them all for a penny

1133
01:23:32,130 --> 01:23:36,077
They make pretty souvenirs

1134
01:23:37,215 --> 01:23:41,170
Take my lovely illusions

1135
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:43,509
Some for love

1136
01:23:44,473 --> 01:23:50,310
Some for tears

1137
01:23:55,616 --> 01:23:57,687
- Good evening.
- May I?

1138
01:23:59,032 --> 01:24:01,866
- Get another glass, John.
- No thank you.

1139
01:24:04,037 --> 01:24:06,327
My, look at the kitchen floor.

1140
01:24:07,791 --> 01:24:10,831
- Look at what?
- Such a change.

1141
01:24:10,881 --> 01:24:14,498
This dress. This dress is from Iowa?

1142
01:24:14,554 --> 01:24:16,925
Oh, no, Berlin. Do you like it?

1143
01:24:17,638 --> 01:24:21,930
It's stunning but haven't you
got it on backwards? And the hair.

1144
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:25,647
What did you put in
those pigtails, shoelaces?

1145
01:24:25,691 --> 01:24:28,606
- I like it.
- He likes it.

1146
01:24:28,650 --> 01:24:33,067
I shouldn't have mentioned the eyebrows.
Now her face looks bow-legged.

1147
01:24:33,117 --> 01:24:36,864
Miss von Schlütow, I think
the pianist is looking for you.

1148
01:24:36,907 --> 01:24:40,192
Have you ever made any progress
hunting down that man?

1149
01:24:40,248 --> 01:24:42,325
- What man?
- My man.

1150
01:24:42,375 --> 01:24:44,126
Oh.

1151
01:24:44,127 --> 01:24:49,370
Oh, a little progress, only that's all been
postponed on account of another man.

1152
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:52,423
Look at him. Isn't he beautiful?

1153
01:24:52,467 --> 01:24:55,420
Phoebe, please.
She always kids me like that.

1154
01:24:55,470 --> 01:25:00,263
- I know he's not pretty but he's beautiful.
- When are you leaving Berlin?

1155
01:25:00,313 --> 01:25:03,347
- Tomorrow. It's our last night together.
- Too bad.

1156
01:25:03,397 --> 01:25:06,150
What he doesn't know is he's going too.

1157
01:25:06,194 --> 01:25:08,646
- I am?
- I talked it over with the general.

1158
01:25:08,696 --> 01:25:11,531
- It was to be a surprise.
- It is.

1159
01:25:11,574 --> 01:25:13,652
- I can't go.
- Yes, you can.

1160
01:25:13,702 --> 01:25:16,373
He hasn't had a furlough in four years.

1161
01:25:17,287 --> 01:25:21,954
This is a bolt from the blue.
I didn't have the slightest, faintest...

1162
01:25:22,004 --> 01:25:25,289
Miss von Schlütow,
isn't it time for your next number?

1163
01:25:25,339 --> 01:25:28,091
There'll be no next number tonight.

1164
01:25:28,135 --> 01:25:30,969
May I steal
one of your American cigarettes?

1165
01:25:47,154 --> 01:25:50,276
Hey, Pringle.
John, the Colone"s looking for you.

1166
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,034
- Colonel?
- Yelling his head off.

1167
01:25:53,035 --> 01:25:55,706
He's got enough blood
in his eye to sell by the pint.

1168
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:59,329
- What does he want?
- I don't know. Get down to his office.

1169
01:26:01,043 --> 01:26:03,170
Check! Check! Er...

1170
01:26:03,214 --> 01:26:05,673
Go on. I'll take care of the check. Hurry.

1171
01:26:05,717 --> 01:26:09,884
- I'll drop you on the way.
- I'll take Miss Frost home. Get going.

1172
01:26:09,934 --> 01:26:12,386
Why are you going? It's so nice here.

1173
01:26:12,436 --> 01:26:15,471
- I got to go. Didn't you hear?
- I forbid you.

1174
01:26:15,521 --> 01:26:18,274
- Phoebe, this is the army.
- I don't want you to go.

1175
01:26:18,317 --> 01:26:19,981
I got to go.

1176
01:26:19,982 --> 01:26:23,272
All right. You're in contempt of Congress.

1177
01:26:24,324 --> 01:26:26,776
Take care of our friend. Goodbye.

1178
01:26:26,826 --> 01:26:28,903
Goodbye, Fräulein von Schlütow.

1179
01:26:31,456 --> 01:26:34,127
- How much?
- No, this is on the house.

1180
01:26:34,165 --> 01:26:37,919
- Thank you. Ready, Miss Frost?
- Sit down. Have some champagne.

1181
01:26:37,963 --> 01:26:40,997
Another bottle.

1182
01:26:41,047 --> 01:26:43,086
Sit down.

1183
01:26:45,970 --> 01:26:50,268
No, I really shouldn't be in a place like this.

1184
01:27:22,426 --> 01:27:24,923
- Ha!

1185
01:27:32,731 --> 01:27:36,485
The stars at night are big and bright

1186
01:27:37,323 --> 01:27:39,400
Deep in the heart of Texas

1187
01:27:40,282 --> 01:27:43,404
The prairie sky is wide and high

1188
01:27:44,124 --> 01:27:47,157
- Deep in the heart of Texas
- Yahoo!

1189
01:27:47,207 --> 01:27:50,704
The sage in bloom is like perfume

1190
01:27:50,755 --> 01:27:53,589
Deep in the heart of Texas

1191
01:27:53,632 --> 01:27:57,167
Reminds me of the one I love

1192
01:27:57,217 --> 01:27:59,676
Deep in the heart of Texas

1193
01:28:02,686 --> 01:28:04,969
Don't suppose you boys
know the Iowa song?

1194
01:28:05,019 --> 01:28:08,054
- Iowa, where's that?
- In the United States, silly.

1195
01:28:08,104 --> 01:28:10,394
- Since when?
- 1846.

1196
01:28:10,444 --> 01:28:13,941
No kidding.

1197
01:28:18,990 --> 01:28:23,288
- Would you like to play it?
- We'll play it but we don't like it.

1198
01:28:25,128 --> 01:28:27,580
- My old campaign song.
- Sing it.

1199
01:28:27,630 --> 01:28:29,707
- No.
- You must. You asked for it.

1200
01:28:29,757 --> 01:28:33,292
Maybe there's some boats around.
Who knows? Go on.

1201
01:28:34,218 --> 01:28:38,266
Ioway, Ioway

1202
01:28:38,310 --> 01:28:41,845
State of all the land, joy on every hand

1203
01:28:41,895 --> 01:28:46,556
We are from Ioway, Ioway

1204
01:28:46,606 --> 01:28:50,140
That's where the tall corn grows

1205
01:28:51,322 --> 01:28:55,070
Fly away, Ioway

1206
01:28:55,114 --> 01:28:58,655
State of all the land, joy on every hand

1207
01:28:58,705 --> 01:29:02,240
- We are from Ioway...

1208
01:29:15,766 --> 01:29:20,177
We are from Ioway, Ioway

1209
01:29:20,227 --> 01:29:22,980
That's where the tall corn grows

1210
01:29:23,024 --> 01:29:25,483
- Everybody, sing!

1211
01:29:25,526 --> 01:29:30,438
We are from Ioway, Ioway

1212
01:29:30,488 --> 01:29:33,822
State of all the land, joy on every hand

1213
01:29:33,866 --> 01:29:38,164
We are from Ioway, Ioway

1214
01:29:38,208 --> 01:29:41,956
That's where the tall corn grows

1215
01:30:01,819 --> 01:30:06,111
This is a raid. All military personnel,
get out their papers.

1216
01:30:11,661 --> 01:30:13,738
Whoo-hoo!

1217
01:30:15,665 --> 01:30:18,336
Hey. Hey, you.

1218
01:30:19,381 --> 01:30:21,294
Who-hoo.

1219
01:30:21,295 --> 01:30:23,504
- Hey.

1220
01:30:25,925 --> 01:30:27,925
Jawohl!

1221
01:30:28,928 --> 01:30:31,387
- Oh, will you...

1222
01:30:31,431 --> 01:30:33,596
Where are we going?

1223
01:30:34,691 --> 01:30:36,761
Pretty hat. Let me try it on.

1224
01:30:57,713 --> 01:31:01,248
What's this? What's happening?
Where are we going?

1225
01:31:02,218 --> 01:31:05,340
- To the police station. This is a raid.
- A what?

1226
01:31:05,390 --> 01:31:09,138
- A raid. We have one every other week.
- That's ridiculous.

1227
01:31:09,181 --> 01:31:11,101
They want to check up on our papers.

1228
01:31:11,102 --> 01:31:13,774
We Germans have to have
our papers in order.

1229
01:31:13,817 --> 01:31:16,270
But I'm not a German. They have no right...

1230
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:20,612
Of course they haven't. There's
no reason why you should submit to it.

1231
01:31:20,656 --> 01:31:25,404
You just tell them who you are and
they'll apologise and let you go home.

1232
01:31:25,455 --> 01:31:28,739
Only on second thoughts, is it a good idea?

1233
01:31:28,789 --> 01:31:32,324
What kind of an impression
will it make on us Germans?

1234
01:31:32,380 --> 01:31:37,417
A Congresswoman of the United States
of America caught at the Lorelei.

1235
01:31:38,343 --> 01:31:41,840
And where did the Honourable
Miss Frost get that dress?

1236
01:31:41,890 --> 01:31:44,180
The black market, maybe?

1237
01:32:09,042 --> 01:32:12,164
- Want some coffee, Captain?
- No thanks, sir.

1238
01:32:12,214 --> 01:32:15,249
- Just as well. This is the only cup.
- Yes, sir.

1239
01:32:15,299 --> 01:32:18,421
How about a jigger of poison
with a hemlock chaser?

1240
01:32:18,471 --> 01:32:20,471
More like it, sir.

1241
01:32:21,349 --> 01:32:26,642
Captain, I think you have as good
a war record as any man in this town.

1242
01:32:26,692 --> 01:32:30,984
You were on the first team since Normandy
and you sure carried the ball.

1243
01:32:31,027 --> 01:32:36,070
I know you were among the first ten men
to cross the Remagen Bridge.

1244
01:32:36,114 --> 01:32:38,867
I also know why you were in such a hurry.

1245
01:32:40,037 --> 01:32:43,159
Did you know what a hot potato
you had on your hands?

1246
01:32:43,209 --> 01:32:48,546
Well, not quite, sir.
I... had a hunch it was warm, all right.

1247
01:32:48,589 --> 01:32:51,261
Sometimes I wonder
if it isn't a waste of money

1248
01:32:51,298 --> 01:32:55,597
to import 11,000 ping-pong tables
for the recreation of you young men.

1249
01:32:57,392 --> 01:32:59,392
Captain, you might as well realise

1250
01:32:59,432 --> 01:33:02,634
we've been wise to you
and the von Schlütow woman all along.

1251
01:33:02,684 --> 01:33:04,684
I kind of figured you were peeking.

1252
01:33:04,730 --> 01:33:08,478
The army has been counting on you
for a certain pattern of behaviour.

1253
01:33:08,528 --> 01:33:11,281
- You let us down but good.
- Sorry, sir.

1254
01:33:12,325 --> 01:33:15,860
Since that committee arrived,
you've been playing a double bill

1255
01:33:15,910 --> 01:33:18,119
with the lady from Iowa in the upper half.

1256
01:33:18,163 --> 01:33:21,197
I'd appreciate it
if you leave her out of this, sir.

1257
01:33:22,254 --> 01:33:24,254
You would?

1258
01:33:25,257 --> 01:33:30,000
Pressure has been exerted to have you
go back to the United States for a while.

1259
01:33:30,050 --> 01:33:32,803
- So I've heard.
- You're not going of course.

1260
01:33:32,847 --> 01:33:36,381
Of course. When do proceedings start, sir?

1261
01:33:37,433 --> 01:33:42,263
Captain Pringle, you're to stay away
from that certain party, off limits.

1262
01:33:42,319 --> 01:33:46,066
Suits me fine. It was all washed up
anyway as far as I'm concerned.

1263
01:33:46,110 --> 01:33:51,022
Let's get this straight. You're to stay
away from the Congresswoman.

1264
01:33:51,078 --> 01:33:52,829
Oh?

1265
01:33:52,830 --> 01:33:55,320
Pick up that torch for
Fräulein von Schlütow,

1266
01:33:55,370 --> 01:33:58,410
light it again and carry it in public,
that's an order.

1267
01:33:59,374 --> 01:34:02,665
- Well, how do you do.
- You've heard of Hans Otto Birgel?

1268
01:34:02,714 --> 01:34:06,167
- That was her guy.
- He's hiding out in the American zone.

1269
01:34:06,218 --> 01:34:08,507
- He's dead.
- He's very much alive.

1270
01:34:08,551 --> 01:34:10,591
And thanks to you, he's kicking.

1271
01:34:10,641 --> 01:34:13,925
We had a hunch about him
so we watched Miss von Schlütow.

1272
01:34:13,976 --> 01:34:16,096
Here are three letters we intercepted.

1273
01:34:16,147 --> 01:34:20,977
Someone tipped him off that his girl
has been seeing an American officer.

1274
01:34:21,027 --> 01:34:24,724
He's a jealous rat. He says he's going
to come out and kill you both.

1275
01:34:25,781 --> 01:34:29,529
- That's cute.
- Now, go on back and fan those flames.

1276
01:34:29,579 --> 01:34:32,532
Stick around the Fräulein until he shows.

1277
01:34:32,582 --> 01:34:35,248
I wish I'd never crossed
the Remagen Bridge.

1278
01:34:35,291 --> 01:34:37,781
Sorry, son, that's the way it reads.

1279
01:34:37,838 --> 01:34:41,998
OK, I'm going.
Only I think I'll have that coffee first.

1280
01:34:42,048 --> 01:34:45,796
Never mind the cup.
Just give me a spoonful of the powder.

1281
01:35:08,744 --> 01:35:11,866
- Do you have your passport with you?
- No.

1282
01:35:11,916 --> 01:35:16,082
You just tell them who you are
and they check with the army officials.

1283
01:35:16,132 --> 01:35:18,798
- I can't do that.
- Why?

1284
01:35:18,842 --> 01:35:23,503
What if the German papers pick it up
and there are some ugly references?

1285
01:35:23,553 --> 01:35:25,630
May never reach Washington.

1286
01:35:26,768 --> 01:35:31,511
Of course there's one person who could
get you out of all this nastiness.

1287
01:35:31,561 --> 01:35:33,851
Me. I could do it.

1288
01:35:34,777 --> 01:35:37,730
No names mentioned. No aftereffects.

1289
01:35:37,780 --> 01:35:39,857
Just as if it never happened.

1290
01:35:41,033 --> 01:35:43,705
Why should you? You don't like me.

1291
01:35:43,742 --> 01:35:47,696
It's not generosity. We Germans
can't afford to be generous.

1292
01:35:47,746 --> 01:35:49,824
We're very poor.

1293
01:35:49,874 --> 01:35:52,545
It's give and take if we are to survive.

1294
01:35:53,546 --> 01:35:56,005
What have I to give?

1295
01:35:56,049 --> 01:35:59,965
- What do you want to take?

1296
01:37:04,462 --> 01:37:08,754
You know what I told him?
That you were a country cousin of mine.

1297
01:37:08,798 --> 01:37:11,257
Perfectly easy if you have a safe conduct

1298
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:14,584
with the signature of
a kind American officer on it.

1299
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:17,093
And you wanted to chop his head off.

1300
01:37:17,143 --> 01:37:20,509
Exactly what is it you want from me,
Fräulein von Schlütow?

1301
01:37:20,559 --> 01:37:24,094
Let's go up to my apartment.
It's only a few ruins away from here.

1302
01:37:24,150 --> 01:37:26,815
- No, I'd rather not.
- You'd better.

1303
01:37:26,859 --> 01:37:28,936
You may need a handkerchief.

1304
01:37:32,953 --> 01:37:37,245
This is a beastly thing to do but you must
understand what happened to us here.

1305
01:37:37,289 --> 01:37:40,573
We all become animals
with exactly one instinct left.

1306
01:37:40,623 --> 01:37:42,543
Self-preservation.

1307
01:37:42,544 --> 01:37:45,829
Take me, Miss Frost.
Bombed out a dozen times.

1308
01:37:45,879 --> 01:37:48,632
Everything caved in
and pulled out from under me.

1309
01:37:48,676 --> 01:37:51,716
My country, my possessions, my beliefs.

1310
01:37:51,766 --> 01:37:53,837
Yet somehow I kept going.

1311
01:37:53,893 --> 01:37:58,304
Months in air-raid shelters
crammed in with 5,000 other people.

1312
01:37:58,354 --> 01:38:00,274
I kept going.

1313
01:38:00,275 --> 01:38:04,936
What do you think it was like to be a woman
here when the Russians swept in?

1314
01:38:04,986 --> 01:38:07,276
I kept going.

1315
01:38:07,326 --> 01:38:10,442
It was a living hell... and then I found a man.

1316
01:38:10,492 --> 01:38:14,027
And through that man,
a roof and a job and food and...

1317
01:38:15,371 --> 01:38:17,661
And I'm not going to lose him.

1318
01:38:17,711 --> 01:38:19,788
What has all this to do with me?

1319
01:38:19,838 --> 01:38:23,123
A little. You see, you want the same man.

1320
01:38:24,843 --> 01:38:28,791
Come on. I told you
you'd need a handkerchief.

1321
01:38:56,213 --> 01:38:59,579
This is how he looked when I met him first.
He was a lieutenant.

1322
01:38:59,629 --> 01:39:02,301
He sat at his desk interrogating me.

1323
01:39:02,344 --> 01:39:05,629
He had such a grim, businesslike face,

1324
01:39:05,679 --> 01:39:09,977
but fortunately I was wearing
my last pair of silk stockings.

1325
01:39:10,978 --> 01:39:13,268
He's really a nice boy.

1326
01:39:13,312 --> 01:39:15,983
You mustn't judge him
by what he did to you.

1327
01:39:16,778 --> 01:39:18,690
He hated it. I know.

1328
01:39:18,691 --> 01:39:23,359
Of course, he would come here
and feel so miserable and sorry for you.

1329
01:39:23,409 --> 01:39:26,324
Your plane is leaving tomorrow, isn't it?

1330
01:39:28,915 --> 01:39:33,957
Don't sit there as if it was the end
of the world. Nothing happened.

1331
01:39:34,001 --> 01:39:36,754
He played a dirty trick on you, that's all.

1332
01:39:37,630 --> 01:39:41,928
So you fly off back home,
wash your hands, wash your lips...

1333
01:39:42,973 --> 01:39:46,095
They've got so much soap
in the United States.

1334
01:39:47,728 --> 01:39:50,681
Sorry. You know this game of love.

1335
01:39:50,731 --> 01:39:53,565
If you want to take
the advice of an old gambler,

1336
01:39:53,609 --> 01:39:56,981
some people are lucky at it,
some people are jinxed.

1337
01:39:57,863 --> 01:40:00,697
They shouldn't even sit down at the table.

1338
01:40:08,293 --> 01:40:10,583
I do not imagine you care to see him again.

1339
01:40:10,626 --> 01:40:14,793
Why not go up the stairs where it's dark
until he comes in and then leave?

1340
01:40:18,472 --> 01:40:21,142
Go on, leave. Haven't you had enough?

1341
01:40:25,021 --> 01:40:27,099
What is this, a big scene?

1342
01:40:27,149 --> 01:40:30,896
We can't keep a gentleman
in the dark, can we?

1343
01:40:30,940 --> 01:40:34,231
Four hours ago you could
have had him court-martialled

1344
01:40:34,281 --> 01:40:37,315
and sent me to a labour camp, not now.

1345
01:40:37,365 --> 01:40:40,406
Not any more. Now you're one of us.

1346
01:40:52,631 --> 01:40:54,631
Hi.

1347
01:41:02,229 --> 01:41:05,513
What's the matter?
No kiss for your little Schweinehund?

1348
01:41:07,278 --> 01:41:11,357
I'm sorry I had to show up with that
Congress dame. She's gone dappy.

1349
01:41:11,407 --> 01:41:14,942
Doesn't mean a thing.
Leaving tomorrow anyway.

1350
01:41:14,992 --> 01:41:16,992
Come on.

1351
01:41:41,024 --> 01:41:43,024
Sorry.

1352
01:41:45,691 --> 01:41:49,989
I guess this is where the funny man says,
"Shall we dance?"

1353
01:41:50,033 --> 01:41:52,705
You are not a funny man, Captain Pringle.

1354
01:41:53,662 --> 01:41:56,115
But you are quite a dancer.

1355
01:41:56,165 --> 01:41:58,242
What a waltz we had.

1356
01:41:59,249 --> 01:42:01,249
Good night.

1357
01:42:39,546 --> 01:42:42,549
Shh! Hey, Fräulein!
Hey, Fräulein!

1358
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:47,636
Hey, Fräulein!
Hey, Fräulein!

1359
01:42:47,679 --> 01:42:49,679
Ein moment, Fräulein!

1360
01:42:51,978 --> 01:42:54,055
Holy mackerel!

1361
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:50,575
The last time we had
one of these, it lasted 11 days.

1362
01:43:50,625 --> 01:43:52,338
You're a great comfort.

1363
01:43:52,339 --> 01:43:57,382
You can't get to Washington soon enough,
can you, to dash off that black Berlin report?

1364
01:43:57,425 --> 01:43:59,884
No report at all, Colonel Plummer.

1365
01:43:59,928 --> 01:44:03,876
- No?
- I came here as an objective observer.

1366
01:44:03,932 --> 01:44:07,680
Some things have happened
which automatically disqualify me.

1367
01:44:07,730 --> 01:44:09,807
Aren't you taking it a little big?

1368
01:44:09,857 --> 01:44:13,223
- You know nothing whatever about it.
- I got a hunch.

1369
01:44:13,279 --> 01:44:17,227
In a way, I'm glad you took off the blinkers
and wandered away on your own.

1370
01:44:17,283 --> 01:44:21,031
It's a big mess we're trying to clean up.
There's a lot of rubble.

1371
01:44:21,075 --> 01:44:25,123
Rubble of all kinds,
vegetable, mineral and animal.

1372
01:44:25,167 --> 01:44:29,208
You walk around on it, you're apt to get
conked on the head by a loose brick.

1373
01:44:29,252 --> 01:44:31,923
Stop it, please.
I've had about all I can stand.

1374
01:44:31,967 --> 01:44:36,921
I'm sorry but I feel a little
responsible about that loose brick, Pringle.

1375
01:44:36,971 --> 01:44:40,256
- Colonel, please.
- I'm not trying to whitewash him.

1376
01:44:40,306 --> 01:44:42,765
There isn't enough paint in Germany for that

1377
01:44:42,809 --> 01:44:45,762
but let me scrape together
something in his defence.

1378
01:44:45,812 --> 01:44:48,271
- I'm not listening.
- Take it from me.

1379
01:44:48,314 --> 01:44:50,392
He won't get off scot-free.

1380
01:44:50,442 --> 01:44:53,482
As a matter of fact,
he's started to pay already.

1381
01:44:53,532 --> 01:44:57,693
It's no fun to walk around
with a target pinned on your chest.

1382
01:45:00,621 --> 01:45:03,543
I'd appreciate it if you'd leave me alone.

1383
01:45:05,420 --> 01:45:08,172
How's about some reading matter
for the plane?

1384
01:45:09,217 --> 01:45:13,878
Those aren't teardrops. I was washing my
hands when he asked me to give it to you.

1385
01:45:15,849 --> 01:45:18,302
All right, I'll put it right there.

1386
01:45:29,444 --> 01:45:33,743
Colonel Plummer, it's clearing. We should
be taking off in about 20 minutes.

1387
01:45:33,786 --> 01:45:35,862
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

1388
01:45:45,253 --> 01:45:50,296
Gentlemen, I was just informed there will
be no flights until tomorrow morning.

1389
01:45:50,346 --> 01:45:53,631
Now, we might as well
get ourselves back into town.

1390
01:45:53,681 --> 01:45:57,892
Sorry, Miss Frost. We're going
to wait for the fog to lift a little.

1391
01:46:15,078 --> 01:46:19,376
Amidst the ruins of Berlin

1392
01:46:19,420 --> 01:46:23,712
Trees are in bloom
as they have never been

1393
01:46:23,756 --> 01:46:27,804
Sometimes at night
you feel in all your sorrow

1394
01:46:27,847 --> 01:46:31,889
Her perfume as of a sweet tomorrow

1395
01:46:31,933 --> 01:46:36,062
That's when you realise at last

1396
01:46:36,106 --> 01:46:40,103
They won't return
the phantoms of the past

1397
01:46:40,153 --> 01:46:44,276
A brand new spring is to begin

1398
01:46:44,320 --> 01:46:47,611
Out of the ruins of Berlin

1399
01:46:53,079 --> 01:46:57,377
Amidst the ruins of Berlin

1400
01:46:57,421 --> 01:47:01,581
Trees are in bloom
as they have never been...

1401
01:47:29,372 --> 01:47:31,831
Hans Otto Birgel.

1402
01:47:31,875 --> 01:47:34,365
Amidst the ruins of Berlin

1403
01:47:35,172 --> 01:47:39,383
Trees are in bloom
as they have never been

1404
01:47:39,427 --> 01:47:43,505
Sometimes at night
you feel in all your sorrow

1405
01:47:43,555 --> 01:47:47,553
Her perfume as of a sweet tomorrow

1406
01:47:47,603 --> 01:47:51,763
That's when you realise at last

1407
01:47:51,813 --> 01:47:55,767
They won't return
the phantoms of the past

1408
01:47:55,818 --> 01:47:59,865
A brand new spring is to begin

1409
01:47:59,909 --> 01:48:03,857
Out of the ruins of Berlin

1410
01:49:39,355 --> 01:49:43,728
So we followed her all day
until the five o'clock shadow showed.

1411
01:49:43,772 --> 01:49:46,525
- Sure enough, she was Hermann.
- Well, doggone.

1412
01:49:46,568 --> 01:49:48,645
You sure spin some tall tales.

1413
01:49:48,695 --> 01:49:51,979
Yeah, well, how about this?
Hans Otto Birgel.

1414
01:49:52,036 --> 01:49:54,488
Big Gestapo man hiding out underground.

1415
01:49:54,538 --> 01:49:58,830
The only lead we have is that
he's still crazy about a former lady friend,

1416
01:49:58,874 --> 01:50:01,877
a nightclub singer
somewhere in the American sector.

1417
01:50:03,128 --> 01:50:06,876
Herr Birgel suspects she's two-timing him
so he crawls out of his hole.

1418
01:50:06,926 --> 01:50:09,134
Only he doesn't crawl fast enough.

1419
01:50:09,178 --> 01:50:12,463
So we play it up a little
with the help of an American officer.

1420
01:50:12,513 --> 01:50:14,433
A captain, to be exact.

1421
01:50:14,434 --> 01:50:18,019
Make a fancy story in
a Sunday supplement someday.

1422
01:50:18,062 --> 01:50:21,478
- The Love Commando.
- Ha.

1423
01:50:21,522 --> 01:50:25,476
Here's their angle. The Captain
isn't very keen for the assignment,

1424
01:50:25,533 --> 01:50:28,817
having fallen for
somebody else in the meantime.

1425
01:50:28,867 --> 01:50:32,121
You know how they cook it up
with a lot of marshmallow on top.

1426
01:50:32,165 --> 01:50:35,449
Then the story of how
they got the poison into Göring's cell.

1427
01:50:35,499 --> 01:50:38,415
- There were two scrub women...

1428
01:50:40,423 --> 01:50:44,584
Sorry, sir. The car has to pull in.
Keeping the street open for the ambulance.

1429
01:50:44,634 --> 01:50:46,924
- What's up?
- Trouble at the Lorelei.

1430
01:50:46,974 --> 01:50:50,302
- Birgel showed up. There was shooting.
- Who got it?

1431
01:50:50,352 --> 01:50:53,385
- I don't know, sir.
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

1432
01:50:53,435 --> 01:50:56,188
Perhaps you'd want
to come along, Miss Frost.

1433
01:50:59,398 --> 01:51:01,398
Hey!

1434
01:51:51,708 --> 01:51:55,461
Mm-hm. Two plugs right through the kisser.

1435
01:51:56,299 --> 01:51:58,299
No.

1436
01:51:59,259 --> 01:52:02,794
- It was an ugly kisser anyway.
- It was not.

1437
01:52:02,850 --> 01:52:05,966
He was no good
and he's dead and it's OK by me.

1438
01:52:06,016 --> 01:52:07,604
Ohh...

1439
01:52:07,605 --> 01:52:09,644
No sense of humour.

1440
01:52:09,688 --> 01:52:11,765
Take care of her, lover boy.

1441
01:52:20,574 --> 01:52:22,864
- All right, clean up the mess.
- Yes, sir.

1442
01:52:22,914 --> 01:52:27,575
Find him a slab before the Russkies
start tossing him up to the ceiling.

1443
01:52:31,755 --> 01:52:33,675
Go on home!

1444
01:52:33,676 --> 01:52:36,428
Come on, break it up, let's go. All right.

1445
01:52:40,182 --> 01:52:41,889
Where are you taking me?

1446
01:52:41,890 --> 01:52:45,844
Looks like you've got a date
with five million von bricks.

1447
01:52:45,894 --> 01:52:48,103
I have a paper saying I'm on the white list.

1448
01:52:48,147 --> 01:52:50,224
We know how you got it and it wasn't,

1449
01:52:50,274 --> 01:52:53,315
if you'll pardon
the non-Aryan expression, kosher.

1450
01:52:53,365 --> 01:52:55,573
You do not understand. There's a mix-up.

1451
01:52:55,617 --> 01:52:58,650
Yeah. We just sent part of it
off to the morgue.

1452
01:52:58,700 --> 01:53:01,785
- Just ask Captain Pringle.
- Forget Captain Pringle.

1453
01:53:01,829 --> 01:53:06,496
How could I ever forget him?
He's so nice. I will miss him terribly.

1454
01:53:06,546 --> 01:53:08,623
- Please tell him.
- No soap.

1455
01:53:08,673 --> 01:53:11,207
And no chocolate, no cigarettes.

1456
01:53:11,257 --> 01:53:13,297
Tough.

1457
01:53:14,429 --> 01:53:19,009
Tell me, Colonel, are you
that wonderful Colonel Plummer?

1458
01:53:19,059 --> 01:53:23,557
That's me,
only most of the time they call me delicious.

1459
01:53:23,607 --> 01:53:27,855
Colonel, if I could come to your office
tomorrow sometime,

1460
01:53:27,899 --> 01:53:29,899
when you're not too busy.

1461
01:53:29,901 --> 01:53:33,855
Miss von Schlütow,
I've become a grandfather today.

1462
01:53:33,912 --> 01:53:35,912
Let's not be silly.

1463
01:53:36,539 --> 01:53:38,610
She's all yours.

1464
01:53:38,667 --> 01:53:41,419
Can they take me
by my apartment so I can change?

1465
01:53:41,457 --> 01:53:45,042
- I guess so.
- Come on, boys.

1466
01:53:46,381 --> 01:53:48,458
Has it stopped raining?

1467
01:53:48,508 --> 01:53:52,675
If there are any puddles,
you'll carry me, won't you, boys?

1468
01:54:02,271 --> 01:54:04,561
You two, watch out for those two.

1469
01:54:04,611 --> 01:54:06,651
Yes, sir.

1470
01:54:12,325 --> 01:54:15,610
- And you watch out for them.
- That ought to do it.

1471
01:54:25,633 --> 01:54:28,674
He said there were two plugs in your kisser.

1472
01:54:28,724 --> 01:54:32,008
There ought to be.
I'm sorry about everything.

1473
01:54:32,058 --> 01:54:34,811
- Except the time with you.
- Take that away.

1474
01:54:34,855 --> 01:54:38,897
It's true. With all the headaches ahead,
you'll be my aspirin.

1475
01:54:38,940 --> 01:54:41,230
That's nice, but what about my headache?

1476
01:54:41,274 --> 01:54:43,314
You're on your way back home.

1477
01:54:43,364 --> 01:54:47,111
You'll be all right by the time
you fasten your seat belt.

1478
01:54:47,155 --> 01:54:49,201
I love you, John.

1479
01:54:50,871 --> 01:54:54,406
No, you don't. I'm just a hit-and-run boy.

1480
01:54:54,456 --> 01:54:57,578
The kind of guy you need
is somebody to marry.

1481
01:54:57,628 --> 01:54:59,335
Well?

1482
01:54:59,336 --> 01:55:02,296
Oh, no. I'm not somebody anybody marries.

1483
01:55:03,427 --> 01:55:09,465
You need somebody respectable,
a senator, a Supreme Court judge,

1484
01:55:09,515 --> 01:55:13,563
maybe... somebody from
the Smithsonian Institute.

1485
01:55:13,606 --> 01:55:15,313
I know who I want.

1486
01:55:15,314 --> 01:55:18,067
Not me, I'm a heel, a certified heel.

1487
01:55:18,111 --> 01:55:20,776
I got documents to prove it.

1488
01:55:20,820 --> 01:55:23,110
Listen...

1489
01:55:23,154 --> 01:55:27,321
"Listen, my children, and you shall hear
of the midnight ride of Paul Revere

1490
01:55:27,371 --> 01:55:31,700
"On the 18th of April in '75, hardly a man
is now alive who remembers..."

1491
01:55:34,503 --> 01:55:36,503
Oh...
