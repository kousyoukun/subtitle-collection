1
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,160
Congressmen, we're now
flying over the heart of Berlin.

2
00:02:02,786 --> 00:02:04,068
Berlin.

3
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,626
Over 75,000 tons of explosives
were dropped here.

4
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:12,953
British Lancasters by night,
American Fortresses by day.

5
00:02:13,537 --> 00:02:16,894
I heard Russian artillery had a little
part in it too, if you don't mind.

6
00:02:17,573 --> 00:02:20,503
Sure they did and I wish
they'd pay us for all those cannons.

7
00:02:21,118 --> 00:02:24,382
Hey, quit juggling. Film like this
is good stuff around election time.

8
00:02:25,153 --> 00:02:26,436
The incumbent overseas.

9
00:02:26,832 --> 00:02:29,429
Pennecot, don't you want to see it?
Look at it.

10
00:02:29,991 --> 00:02:33,286
Like pack rats been gnawing at a hunk
of old mouldy Roquefort cheese.

11
00:02:40,607 --> 00:02:43,297
Miss Frost? Congresswoman Frost?

12
00:02:44,153 --> 00:02:46,436
- Present.
- We're flying over Berlin.

13
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:51,452
15 minutes ahead of schedule.

14
00:02:51,952 --> 00:02:53,600
Well, don't you want to see it?

15
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,685
One thing at a time.

16
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,656
You got quite a sight coming.
Looks like chicken innards at frying time.

17
00:03:39,334 --> 00:03:41,285
Considering the taxpayers' money
poured on it,

18
00:03:41,775 --> 00:03:44,058
I don't expect it to look
like a lace Valentine.

19
00:03:48,698 --> 00:03:49,950
Golly.

20
00:03:55,654 --> 00:03:58,949
(Man) Well, that's rough doing.
That sure is rough doing.

21
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,498
(2nd man) They ought to put in grass
and move in a herd of longhorn.

22
00:04:08,218 --> 00:04:11,055
Build up their industries.
Get those smokestacks belching again.

23
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:14,433
- Not without organised labour.
- We got to feed the people.

24
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:17,634
You can't keep a country
eating scraps out of garbage pails.

25
00:04:18,198 --> 00:04:20,825
I'm all for sending food,
only let 'em know where it's from.

26
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,287
I object to dollar diplomacy.

27
00:04:23,766 --> 00:04:26,237
- But you don't mind sending food.
- There's a difference.

28
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:29,104
If you give a hungry man bread,
that's democracy.

29
00:04:29,646 --> 00:04:31,961
If you leave the wrapper
on, it's imperialism.

30
00:04:32,712 --> 00:04:36,007
Gentlemen, these are
very grave problems indeed

31
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:39,095
but they don't happen to be
the problems of this committee.

32
00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:42,254
Perhaps I should remind you
why we were sent to Berlin,

33
00:04:42,838 --> 00:04:45,466
since our chairman,
Mr Pennecot of New Hampshire,

34
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:48,843
has been indisposed ever since
we took off from Washington.

35
00:04:50,211 --> 00:04:53,996
We're here to investigate the morale
of American occupation troops,

36
00:04:54,736 --> 00:04:56,132
nothing else.

37
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,625
12,000 of our boys are policing
that pest hole down below

38
00:05:00,263 --> 00:05:04,350
and according to reports, they are being
infected by a kind of moral malaria.

39
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:09,469
It is our duty to their wives, their
mothers, their sisters, to find the facts.

40
00:05:10,251 --> 00:05:12,171
And if these reports are true,

41
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,486
to fumigate that place with
all the insecticides at our disposal.

42
00:05:16,686 --> 00:05:19,407
If you'll pardon me,
we're approaching Tempelhof Airfield.

43
00:05:22,358 --> 00:05:24,892
(Man) Oh, God, if they haven't got
a reception out for us.

44
00:05:25,454 --> 00:05:26,915
(2nd man) A band and everything.

45
00:05:27,331 --> 00:05:29,500
(3rd man) They'll be
glad to see home folks.

46
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:44,026
Men, once more it is our honour and
privilege to welcome a visiting committee.

47
00:05:45,465 --> 00:05:48,457
Lately they seem to be coming
as regularly as the electric bill.

48
00:05:49,292 --> 00:05:51,335
This time it's not just VIPs.

49
00:05:51,931 --> 00:05:54,277
This time we're getting VIPIs.

50
00:05:54,861 --> 00:05:56,905
Very Important Persons Indeed.

51
00:05:57,707 --> 00:06:00,481
Some Congressional committee
to investigate our morale.

52
00:06:02,201 --> 00:06:05,685
Seems back home, they've got an idea
this here is one great big picnic,

53
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:10,021
that all we do is swing in hammocks
with blonde Fräuleins,

54
00:06:10,721 --> 00:06:12,391
swap cigarettes for castles on the Rhine

55
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,902
and soak our feet in sparkling Mosel.

56
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:17,143
Well, let's not kid ourselves.

57
00:06:17,822 --> 00:06:20,022
Some of you do go
overboard once in a while.

58
00:06:20,742 --> 00:06:24,193
Maybe some of you are working too hard
to enlighten the civilian population

59
00:06:24,913 --> 00:06:27,082
and maybe some of you
PX millionaires have found out

60
00:06:27,593 --> 00:06:30,553
you can parlay a pack of cigarettes
into something more than 20 smokes.

61
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,840
After all, this isn't a Boy Scout camp.

62
00:06:35,454 --> 00:06:37,133
We've got a tough job on our hands

63
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:39,845
and, by and large,
I think we're handling it darn well.

64
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,545
For my dough, we're on the ball.

65
00:06:43,254 --> 00:06:45,789
Most of us, anyway... most of the time.

66
00:06:46,382 --> 00:06:50,262
What they've got to realise is you can't
pin sergeant's stripes on an archangel.

67
00:06:52,336 --> 00:06:54,807
Now, this committee
is going to be here for five days.

68
00:06:55,434 --> 00:06:57,843
Let's give them as good
an impression as possible.

69
00:06:58,562 --> 00:07:00,730
Not pussyfooting
around with a phoney attitude.

70
00:07:01,241 --> 00:07:03,191
That's not fair to them or us.

71
00:07:03,786 --> 00:07:06,446
I'm counting on you men to behave, period.

72
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:11,731
Morale. Maybe some day we can send
a little committee of our own

73
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:14,391
to investigate morale in Washington, DC.

74
00:07:19,407 --> 00:07:22,889
Hey, look what I picked up
at the Brandenburg Gate.

75
00:07:25,215 --> 00:07:27,529
- How much?
- A dozen candy bars.

76
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,158
They've still got some nine and a halfs.

77
00:07:30,606 --> 00:07:32,838
- I got no one to give them to.
- How about Trudy?

78
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:36,289
I lost her. Russian sergeant came along
with a pound of rancid butter.

79
00:07:36,903 --> 00:07:39,532
- Those German dames are all alike.
- Speak for yourself.

80
00:07:40,179 --> 00:07:43,109
I wouldn't be afraid
of a Russian general with a ton of caviar.

81
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,393
Nice toe.

82
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:50,804
The best.

83
00:08:00,876 --> 00:08:02,982
We're here, Congressman.
Ready to unload?

84
00:08:13,964 --> 00:08:16,310
Present... arms!

85
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,465
- Hello, Colonel.
- Nice to see you, General.

86
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:40,782
Mr Giffin from Texas, General Finney,
General McAndrew, Colonel Plummer.

87
00:08:41,513 --> 00:08:43,400
- My pleasure.
- Mr Salvatore, from New York.

88
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,903
- The Bronx.
- Nobody's going to think you're Wall Street.

89
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:50,792
Mr Yandell, Congressman from Virginia.
Mr Kraus, Congressman from Illinois.

90
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,235
Hold it, everybody.
Want to get some of this brass.

91
00:08:55,538 --> 00:08:57,184
Snappy little outfit you have.

92
00:08:57,623 --> 00:08:59,459
Thank you. I have to
apologise for the band.

93
00:08:59,751 --> 00:09:02,471
- You should indeed.
- We're half strength today.

94
00:09:03,055 --> 00:09:05,057
- We generally have 40 pieces.
- That's terrible.

95
00:09:05,526 --> 00:09:09,156
We sent the others to the British sector
for a parade. It's Empire Day.

96
00:09:09,876 --> 00:09:13,535
What's terrible is I came hoping to find
an army taking its task with seriousness.

97
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:16,517
Instead I find you have a 40-piece band.

98
00:09:17,038 --> 00:09:18,927
Perhaps you also have
some drum majorettes.

99
00:09:19,406 --> 00:09:20,752
- May I introduce...
- I know.

100
00:09:21,283 --> 00:09:23,514
General Finney, General McAndrew
and Colonel Plummer.

101
00:09:24,035 --> 00:09:27,488
It's in my data. I am Miss Frost,
Congresswoman from Iowa, 9th district.

102
00:09:28,176 --> 00:09:31,325
Delightful of Congress to send us
a lady representative for a change.

103
00:09:31,961 --> 00:09:32,930
Delightful.

104
00:09:33,284 --> 00:09:36,090
May I suggest here and now that
we dispense with all the soft soap.

105
00:09:37,154 --> 00:09:39,843
As committee chairman,
permit me to bring you greetings

106
00:09:40,418 --> 00:09:42,378
from the people
of the United States of America.

107
00:09:43,306 --> 00:09:47,768
This genial reception augurs well
for the success of our mission.

108
00:09:48,592 --> 00:09:52,221
I sincerely hope so. And now let us proceed
to a luncheon we have prepared for you.

109
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:56,642
A very simple luncheon. Powdered egg
omelette, probably, and a little Spam.

110
00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:07,591
- Can I carry that for you?
- No, thank you.

111
00:10:08,082 --> 00:10:11,105
I undertook to deliver it in person
to a Captain John Pringle,

112
00:10:11,732 --> 00:10:13,837
stationed somewhere in Berlin, G2 Section.

113
00:10:14,338 --> 00:10:16,778
- Could you tell me how to go about it?
- I could try.

114
00:10:17,372 --> 00:10:19,843
Through army channels?
All I have is five days.

115
00:10:20,845 --> 00:10:21,878
Captain Pringle!

116
00:10:23,463 --> 00:10:24,807
Captain Pringle!

117
00:10:29,448 --> 00:10:30,907
Captain Pringle reporting, sir.

118
00:10:31,324 --> 00:10:33,734
Congresswoman Frost,
this is Captain Pringle.

119
00:10:34,276 --> 00:10:37,018
Thank you. This is for you,
Captain Pringle. Happy birthday.

120
00:10:37,862 --> 00:10:40,698
Or happy birthday yesterday.
I thought I could deliver it on time

121
00:10:41,304 --> 00:10:44,202
but we were held up
in Newfoundland for 16 hours - fog.

122
00:10:44,818 --> 00:10:47,654
- You brought this from America?
- Murdoch, Iowa.

123
00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:50,282
Well, how is good old Iowa?

124
00:10:50,772 --> 00:10:52,597
62°% Republican, thank you.

125
00:10:53,065 --> 00:10:56,360
I was entrusted with this by a constituent,
or rather, his daughter.

126
00:10:57,247 --> 00:10:59,260
I hope it's still in one piece. Open it.

127
00:10:59,989 --> 00:11:01,356
Be glad.

128
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:13,388
Well, what do you know? Little Dusty.

129
00:11:14,536 --> 00:11:15,965
- Untranslated subtitle -

130
00:11:16,382 --> 00:11:17,383
It's a beauty.

131
00:11:18,227 --> 00:11:20,032
I didn't know it was so personal.

132
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:23,837
Her name is really Pauline Rose
but we call her Dusty. Some joke.

133
00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:27,685
- How long since you've seen her?
- Dusty? Four years.

134
00:11:28,728 --> 00:11:31,814
Don't these boys ever get home?
Can't they be given a short leave?

135
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,796
- Certainly, if it's accrued.
- I don't want any leave.

136
00:11:35,338 --> 00:11:37,653
- You don't?
- Oh, of course I do. Dying to.

137
00:11:38,195 --> 00:11:40,970
We're all homesick
but personal feelings don't matter.

138
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,419
There's unfinished business here.

139
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,079
Now that we've won the war,
we mustn't lose the peace.

140
00:11:47,237 --> 00:11:49,740
I hate to think of anybody
sitting in his lonely barracks

141
00:11:50,302 --> 00:11:52,565
with a birthday cake on his knees.

142
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,725
I won't have the cake on my knees.
I won't be alone.

143
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,405
There'll be my buddies. I'll call them in.

144
00:11:59,906 --> 00:12:02,628
We'll open up a case of root beer,
light the candles,

145
00:12:03,211 --> 00:12:05,036
then Frankovitch and his ukulele.

146
00:12:05,506 --> 00:12:09,050
Some old songs.
Why, it'll be like back home... almost.

147
00:12:10,031 --> 00:12:11,377
Good to hear you talk like that.

148
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,525
General Finney wants you to go in his car.

149
00:12:13,931 --> 00:12:14,963
I'll be right with you.

150
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:19,437
If you're a sample of the spirit prevailing
in Berlin, I feel better already.

151
00:12:20,219 --> 00:12:22,200
- I'm a sample, all right.
- Goodbye.

152
00:12:27,945 --> 00:12:30,291
You're losing something, Captain Pringle.

153
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:32,929
My handkerchief.

154
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,349
You blow your nose in nylon nowadays?

155
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:41,678
What do you know? There must have
been a mistake at the laundry.

156
00:12:42,314 --> 00:12:45,307
We got a crazy old laundress.
You know what happened to Frankovitch?

157
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,248
He sent out his shorts and
got back a girdle. (Laughs)

158
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:10,803
Ask her how much.

159
00:13:16,172 --> 00:13:17,913
800 cigarettes, or coffee.

160
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,836
No. This watch gold. Gold for teeth.

161
00:13:43,868 --> 00:13:45,817
- A watch from steel.
- How's this?

162
00:13:46,297 --> 00:13:48,582
No, this silver. Want steel.

163
00:13:49,124 --> 00:13:50,343
You want steel.

164
00:13:50,718 --> 00:13:54,378
No, want round watch, very big, nice face.

165
00:13:55,349 --> 00:13:58,342
You're tough. All right,
let's look in the other drawer.

166
00:14:02,304 --> 00:14:04,316
(Cackles) Mickey Mouse! Mickey Mouse!

167
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,444
- How much?
- $700.

168
00:14:08,123 --> 00:14:10,750
- You got three like this watch, maybe?
- We'll see.

169
00:14:20,854 --> 00:14:24,639
Herr Captain, buy porcelain?
Little Cupid to take for wife?

170
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,913
Never mind the knick-knacks.
How much for the mattress?

171
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,969
- Why you want the mattress?
- I'm sleepy.

172
00:14:31,531 --> 00:14:33,180
- How much for the mattress?

173
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,601
What do you mean, "nein, nein, no"?

174
00:14:39,051 --> 00:14:40,666
Look what you can get for it.

175
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,361
12 eggs in it and look at
the writing on it and the candles.

176
00:14:48,893 --> 00:14:51,490
The candles alone are worth the mattress.
Get lost.

177
00:16:55,505 --> 00:16:57,976
Erika! Erika!

178
00:17:18,225 --> 00:17:20,030
Sit down, Johnny.

179
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,986
Go away, Johnny, sit down.

180
00:17:47,422 --> 00:17:48,549
Johnny.

181
00:17:48,914 --> 00:17:50,957
Johnny, what are you doing?

182
00:17:51,489 --> 00:17:54,055
- I'm wiping my face.
- You're hurting me, Johnny.

183
00:17:54,617 --> 00:17:57,485
You're always hurting me.
Why are you so mean to me?

184
00:17:58,101 --> 00:18:00,906
I worry about you. I scrounge around,
I bring you presents

185
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,844
and you tell me I'm mean to you.

186
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:05,775
You brought me a present? Where is it?
Where have you got it?

187
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:08,058
Ohh...

188
00:18:09,195 --> 00:18:12,980
Johnny, they're so sheer. So beautiful.

189
00:18:13,721 --> 00:18:16,463
52 gauge. So I'm mean to you?

190
00:18:17,058 --> 00:18:19,831
- No, you're good to me.
- You bet I am.

191
00:18:20,437 --> 00:18:24,159
You don't know how good. I bought you another present.
You're not gonna get it.

192
00:18:24,889 --> 00:18:27,298
Another one? Where have you got it?
Where is it, Johnny?

193
00:18:28,017 --> 00:18:30,550
- Keep away.
- Is it here? Tell me...

194
00:18:32,157 --> 00:18:33,407
Johnny...

195
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,175
- Where did you get it?
- A friend of mine baked it.

196
00:18:39,717 --> 00:18:42,845
Only you're not going to get it. Why
should I care whether you sleep or not?

197
00:18:43,543 --> 00:18:47,172
Johnny, for 15 years
we haven't slept in Germany.

198
00:18:47,892 --> 00:18:50,646
First it was Hitler screaming on the radio,
then the war of nerves,

199
00:18:51,092 --> 00:18:52,917
then the victory celebrations,

200
00:18:53,668 --> 00:18:55,034
then the bombing.

201
00:18:55,713 --> 00:18:57,454
All the furniture burnt.

202
00:18:57,912 --> 00:18:59,008
See?

203
00:19:01,948 --> 00:19:05,004
That one I hate worst.
Give me that mattress, Johnny.

204
00:19:05,628 --> 00:19:07,307
No mattress will help you sleep.

205
00:19:07,755 --> 00:19:09,706
What you Germans need
is a better conscience.

206
00:19:10,186 --> 00:19:11,676
I have a good conscience.

207
00:19:12,105 --> 00:19:14,670
I have a new Führer now... you.

208
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:16,389
Heil, Johnny.

209
00:19:16,766 --> 00:19:18,996
You heil me once more
and I'll knock your teeth in.

210
00:19:19,518 --> 00:19:20,831
You'll bruise your lips.

211
00:19:21,218 --> 00:19:24,241
Why don't I choke you a little?
Break you in two?

212
00:19:25,327 --> 00:19:28,840
Build a fire under you, you blonde witch.

213
00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:31,238
Who's that?

214
00:19:31,656 --> 00:19:33,669
With my luck, it's Eisenhower.

215
00:19:43,106 --> 00:19:44,691
- Yes.
- Your name Schlütow?

216
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:47,432
- I beg your pardon.
- Is your name Erika Schlütow?

217
00:19:47,974 --> 00:19:49,894
- No.
- You live here, don't you?

218
00:19:50,374 --> 00:19:51,342
Yes, I live here.

219
00:19:51,698 --> 00:19:53,709
You the dame that sings
at the Lorelei nightclub?

220
00:19:54,377 --> 00:19:57,464
- Yes, I sing there.
- And your name's not Erika Schlütow?

221
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:01,594
My name is Erika von Schlütow.

222
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:04,013
- A von?
- She's a von.

223
00:20:04,472 --> 00:20:07,037
Nobility. We beg your highness's pardon.

224
00:20:07,672 --> 00:20:09,623
- What do you want?
- A little information.

225
00:20:10,144 --> 00:20:12,282
It says here that a
certain Erika Schlütow...

226
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,847
von Schlütow, pardon I...

227
00:20:15,326 --> 00:20:18,193
has been an active von Nazi
ever since 19 - von - 35.

228
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:21,176
Go on, gentlemen.

229
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,743
It says that Miss von Schlütow
was ordered over a month ago

230
00:20:25,347 --> 00:20:28,005
to a von labour camp
to pick up some von bricks.

231
00:20:28,579 --> 00:20:31,144
- What else does it say?
- You're working at a night joint.

232
00:20:31,707 --> 00:20:34,877
According to this report,
what you're moving there ain't bricks.

233
00:20:35,712 --> 00:20:39,496
I'm an artist, gentlemen, not a street
cleaner, and I've been completely cleared.

234
00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:42,282
Yeah? Tell us all about it.

235
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,431
My case has been reviewed
and the decision reversed.

236
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,548
I'm on the white list now.

237
00:20:49,663 --> 00:20:52,720
With that record? If you make the white
list, we'll make the hit parade.

238
00:20:54,397 --> 00:20:56,472
- OK, von sister, get your things on.
- What for?

239
00:20:57,004 --> 00:20:59,237
We're taking you to
the von denazification office.

240
00:21:06,995 --> 00:21:09,404
Now, Abbot and Costello,
show me your orders.

241
00:21:09,946 --> 00:21:11,406
- Yes, sir.
- Who gave you these?

242
00:21:11,822 --> 00:21:13,740
- Lieutenant Clark, sir.
- Four weeks old.

243
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,690
We've had a lot of people to check.

244
00:21:15,962 --> 00:21:19,131
Paperwork, that's why we're always
fouled up when a war starts.

245
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,427
Takes us six months to clear up
the paperwork from the last one.

246
00:21:22,854 --> 00:21:25,264
I'll talk to Clark.
This case is straightened out.

247
00:21:25,816 --> 00:21:27,984
- Sorry, sir.
- OK. That's all. Take off.

248
00:21:32,386 --> 00:21:35,075
- May I have that, please?
- Sorry.

249
00:21:38,621 --> 00:21:42,250
Take an ordinary guy, make him an MP,
suddenly he gets to be eight feet tall.

250
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,232
- If they look into the files for my papers.
- Stop worrying. They're OK.

251
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:50,050
- Goodbye. I got a desk full of work.
- Did the Colonel sign my papers?

252
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,273
Not exactly. He was out of the office
having his tonsils swabbed.

253
00:21:55,003 --> 00:21:57,504
- The duty officer signed them.
- Who was the duty officer?

254
00:21:58,142 --> 00:21:59,298
I was.

255
00:21:59,664 --> 00:22:03,324
Johnny, if they find out you know me,
that's very dangerous.

256
00:22:04,158 --> 00:22:05,773
Everything is dangerous.

257
00:22:06,275 --> 00:22:09,444
I know an old lady back home,
broke her leg stepping into a church pew.

258
00:22:11,739 --> 00:22:13,022
See you, baby.

259
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,299
Johnny! When you come back,
bring me some sugar.

260
00:22:19,913 --> 00:22:21,196
- Yeah, sure.
- And some soap.

261
00:22:21,728 --> 00:22:23,281
And hairpins.

262
00:22:23,782 --> 00:22:26,983
- Anything else?
- A pillow to go with that mattress.

263
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,957
Ah, you gorgeous booby trap.

264
00:22:39,746 --> 00:22:41,603
On your left is the Russian war memorial,

265
00:22:42,082 --> 00:22:44,751
built in honour of their soldiers
killed in the battle of Berlin.

266
00:22:45,284 --> 00:22:47,881
Those tanks on the side
were the first to enter Berlin.

267
00:22:49,381 --> 00:22:52,217
Beyond it, the Reichstag,
the German house of representatives.

268
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,451
That's the building set on fire in 1933
and blamed on a poor Dutchman.

269
00:22:57,318 --> 00:22:59,517
The word got out it was Hitler
who threw the match.

270
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:03,938
They used to say it's the first time in
history a man gave himself the hotfoot.

271
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:14,022
The Brandenburg Gate, an arch of triumph
until they got out of the habit.

272
00:23:15,347 --> 00:23:17,630
That rubble heap over there
was the American embassy.

273
00:23:18,755 --> 00:23:21,561
You can't tell now but this spot
was once the heart of Europe.

274
00:23:22,165 --> 00:23:23,917
The street is the famous Unter den Linden,

275
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:26,589
named after the linden trees,
which they've replanted now.

276
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,467
That pile of stone over there
was the Adlon Hotel,

277
00:23:30,967 --> 00:23:33,375
just after the 8th Air Force
checked in for the weekend.

278
00:23:34,898 --> 00:23:36,545
Now, let's look at the Wilhelmstraße.

279
00:23:39,454 --> 00:23:42,509
Here's the Reich Chancellery where
the Führer fixed himself up a duplex.

280
00:23:43,178 --> 00:23:46,629
As it turned out, one part got to be a big
padded cell and the other a mortuary.

281
00:23:47,765 --> 00:23:49,413
Underneath is a concrete basement,

282
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:52,604
where he married Eva Braun
and where they killed themselves.

283
00:23:53,229 --> 00:23:55,670
A lot of people say it was
the perfect honeymoon.

284
00:23:58,068 --> 00:24:02,218
Over there is the balcony where he bet
his Reich would last a thousand years.

285
00:24:03,324 --> 00:24:05,202
That's the one that broke
the bookies' hearts.

286
00:24:08,954 --> 00:24:12,124
This is the Tiergarten,
used to be the Central Park of Berlin.

287
00:24:13,239 --> 00:24:16,691
Those two big cement things are
the zoo bunkers, enormous pillboxes.

288
00:24:17,765 --> 00:24:20,758
They were the last two buildings
in Berlin to surrender.

289
00:24:42,499 --> 00:24:45,252
I thought you'd be interested
in a typical Berlin residential area.

290
00:24:46,086 --> 00:24:48,953
If you look hard,
you'll see the houses are empty shells,

291
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:51,968
completely burned out by incendiaries.

292
00:24:52,697 --> 00:24:54,772
Life goes on in those ruins, though.

293
00:25:14,126 --> 00:25:16,596
That used to be
the largest department store in Berlin.

294
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:21,362
It was 12 storeys high. Later on it became
headquarters for the storm troopers.

295
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,856
They blew it up themselves.

296
00:25:25,638 --> 00:25:27,682
The idea was to destroy all their records.

297
00:25:28,182 --> 00:25:30,978
They overlooked the fact that most
of them were in fireproof vaults.

298
00:25:53,437 --> 00:25:54,783
Excuse me.

299
00:26:01,195 --> 00:26:02,561
Well.

300
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,910
This is one of our youth clubs. We've
got a lot of them in the American zone.

301
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:11,153
We had quite a problem. Those weren't
ordinary youngsters when we came in.

302
00:26:12,093 --> 00:26:15,543
They were mean old men. Now we're
trying to make kids of them again.

303
00:26:16,472 --> 00:26:19,517
We had to kick the goose step out of them
and cure them of blind obedience

304
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:21,947
and teach them to beep at the referee.

305
00:26:22,426 --> 00:26:24,804
If they want to steal,
make sure it's second base.

306
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:33,365
One thing they don't have to worry about
round here, breaking windows.

307
00:26:34,188 --> 00:26:36,930
One family has already
christened a kid DiMaggio Schultz.

308
00:26:37,525 --> 00:26:39,934
That's when I started believing
we'd won the war.

309
00:26:52,207 --> 00:26:54,125
Hey, Fräulein! Hey, Fräulein!

310
00:26:57,566 --> 00:27:00,100
Hey, Fräulein! Hey, Fräulein!

311
00:27:10,924 --> 00:27:12,238
No, no, no.

312
00:27:12,633 --> 00:27:16,241
Come on. What's the matter with you two?
Just a little Spazierfahren in the park.

313
00:27:16,941 --> 00:27:19,443
Nein, we don't bicycle. We automobile.
(Both laugh)

314
00:27:21,466 --> 00:27:23,271
Automobile? You got yourselves officers?

315
00:27:25,335 --> 00:27:26,587
- French officers.

316
00:27:27,348 --> 00:27:30,402
OK. So they got an automobile
but we got the candy bar.

317
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,818
Ah, your Führer's moustache.

318
00:27:46,481 --> 00:27:48,890
Hey, Doctor, I got a lady on the balcony.

319
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,196
Size 14.

320
00:27:52,603 --> 00:27:54,677
Hey, Fräulein! Hey, Fräulein!

321
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:58,182
Hey, Fräulein! Stop, Fräulein!

322
00:28:01,862 --> 00:28:04,031
- Guten afternoon, Fräulein.
- Hello, Fräulein.

323
00:28:06,596 --> 00:28:08,766
Das is my friend Brigadier General Mike.

324
00:28:09,724 --> 00:28:11,988
And das is mein Freund,
Lieutenant General Joe.

325
00:28:12,509 --> 00:28:13,394
Jawohl.

326
00:28:13,729 --> 00:28:15,648
You know, you're a nice little strudel.

327
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:18,076
Hey, hands off. I saw her first.

328
00:28:19,672 --> 00:28:21,623
Fräulein, would you like
a little Spaßmachen,

329
00:28:22,113 --> 00:28:24,854
- Biertrinken and Tanzen making?
- Jawohl.

330
00:28:26,253 --> 00:28:28,994
She must be tetched in the wool.
All she can say is, "Jawohl".

331
00:28:32,894 --> 00:28:36,503
Fräulein, Fräulein, willst du ein candy bar

332
00:28:37,243 --> 00:28:40,965
<i>Schön, fein Fräulein,
you like Gls, nicht wahr?</i>

333
00:28:41,706 --> 00:28:43,448
At home though you won't believe us

334
00:28:43,895 --> 00:28:45,387
<i>The girls could take or leave us</i>

335
00:28:45,804 --> 00:28:49,464
<i>But here we squares is millionaires,
ach, du wunderbar candy bar [Music:]</i>

336
00:28:51,091 --> 00:28:53,656
Don't give her that candy bar yet.
Are you crazy?

337
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:57,618
- I ain't giving. I'm just showing.
- Say, was ist your name?

338
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:03,238
- Er, Gretchen.
- Gretchen what?

339
00:29:05,011 --> 00:29:07,942
- Gesundheit. Gretchen Gesundheit.
- Gesundheit!

340
00:29:08,557 --> 00:29:11,122
How do you like that?
We're fraternising with a sneeze.

341
00:29:11,726 --> 00:29:13,708
<i>Gretchen, Gretchen... [Music:]</i>

342
00:30:01,058 --> 00:30:03,593
- I'm sorry. It's five packs now.
- Four packs.

343
00:30:04,155 --> 00:30:06,961
Five packs for champagne,
three for wine, one for beer.

344
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:10,902
This is eine kleine clip joint.
Here's your tip.

345
00:30:11,955 --> 00:30:15,344
How do you like these prices? We got
to write Congress to boost our PX ration.

346
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:19,933
Fat chance. All them schmoes think about is
coal strikes, flood control, United Nations.

347
00:30:20,684 --> 00:30:23,675
What's Congress? A bunch of salesmen
with their foot in the right door.

348
00:30:24,301 --> 00:30:26,773
For my dough, you can have
Congress and the Senate.

349
00:30:27,335 --> 00:30:28,619
- I'll take it.
- You got it.

350
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:49,066
Hey!

351
00:30:50,194 --> 00:30:51,652
What a bunch of cut-ups.

352
00:30:54,615 --> 00:30:56,261
Hey, Gretchen, you live with your mother?
(Speaking German)

353
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,681
What business is it of yours?

354
00:30:59,276 --> 00:31:01,048
Look, what do you want, the whole family?

355
00:31:01,496 --> 00:31:03,874
You pulling a trick like the one
with the Schultz sisters?

356
00:31:04,353 --> 00:31:06,023
Nein, nein, you Soldaten, United States.

357
00:31:31,006 --> 00:31:32,717
Fry the uniformen.

358

She was up there with them big Nazis.

She was Goebbels' girl or Göring's.

- How did she get away with it?
- Just look at her.

00:36:02,497 --> 00:36:04,508
- She's hooked herself some big brass.
- Who?

All I know is, some big shot's

- I said ape and I meant ape.

- Where did you get that cake?
- (Joe) Hey, Mike.

Where'd this restaurant get food?
Our business, not yours.

I'm making it my business.

432

of the United States of America.

- Yeah, let's go.

Put back that slice of the cake.

436
00:37:19,139 --> 00:37:21,672
Take out the knife.
I want to know what it is doing here.

437
00:37:22,235 --> 00:37:23,976
- It is being eaten.
- That's enough.

438
00:37:24,435 --> 00:37:26,115
- This cake is confiscated.
- Hello.

439
00:37:26,553 --> 00:37:29,432
- How do you do? So that's where it is.
- What do you know about this?

440
00:37:29,963 --> 00:37:31,880
Very little. It was stolen out of my Jeep.

441
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,706
- It was?
- Stolen and sold on the black market.

442
00:37:35,248 --> 00:37:37,387
They'll steal anything around here.

443
00:37:38,346 --> 00:37:41,214
- When I think of that girl back in Iowa...
- Yeah.

444
00:37:41,901 --> 00:37:44,165
I'll take care of this.
Don't trouble yourself.

445
00:37:44,686 --> 00:37:48,138
Thank you. Will you also take care
of a pair of disgusting soldiers

446
00:37:48,825 --> 00:37:51,234
who should be stood up
against a wall and...

447
00:37:54,113 --> 00:37:57,803
I want you to find them. They're medium height.
One is a little taller.

448
00:37:58,533 --> 00:38:02,016
Their names are Mike and Joe and
they're in uniforms with US on the collar.

449
00:38:03,017 --> 00:38:04,113
Perfect sense, ma'am.

450
00:38:04,477 --> 00:38:06,761
Now, what exactly is
the name of this sewer?

451
00:38:07,292 --> 00:38:08,418
- The Lorelei.
- Address?

452
00:38:08,793 --> 00:38:11,631
- Number 15, Hagenbachstraße.
- Are there other sewers like this?

453
00:38:12,236 --> 00:38:15,155
- Three or four but this is the best.
- What is the name of that woman?

454
00:38:15,957 --> 00:38:17,480
- What woman?
- The singer here.

455
00:38:18,012 --> 00:38:20,545
Oh, the singer. I think it's Erika.

456
00:38:21,182 --> 00:38:23,622
- Erika what?
- Erika von Schlütow.

457
00:38:24,905 --> 00:38:26,061
Why do you ask about her?

458
00:38:26,438 --> 00:38:29,858
Because there's something funny going on
here and I'm not in the mood for laughs.

459
00:38:30,816 --> 00:38:32,860
Schlütow? How do you spell it?

460
00:38:33,361 --> 00:38:35,165
Schlütow, with an umlaut.

461
00:38:35,718 --> 00:38:37,730
I thought so.

462
00:38:40,941 --> 00:38:43,382
I want you to remember
that when we moved into Germany,

463
00:38:43,935 --> 00:38:46,499
we found a country of
open graves and closed hearts.

464
00:38:47,063 --> 00:38:49,410
We've tried to turn it
into a civilised state.

465
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:53,037
We had to eliminate things
that breed unrest and aggression.

466
00:38:53,673 --> 00:38:56,364
We've tried to make them free men
and give them some dignity.

467
00:38:57,053 --> 00:39:00,170
We had to return four million
displaced persons to their homes.

468
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:03,351
That's hard if you don't have
a home to start with.

469
00:39:03,903 --> 00:39:06,344
We had to repair hospitals
and public utilities.

470
00:39:07,031 --> 00:39:09,961
I remember the first day the gasworks
started operating again.

471
00:39:10,588 --> 00:39:13,246
There were 160 suicides in Berlin alone.

472
00:39:14,164 --> 00:39:15,748
That was ten months ago.

473
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:19,336
Today, they take a match and light
the gas and boil some potatoes.

474
00:39:20,431 --> 00:39:23,329
Not many potatoes, mind you.
There is still a lot of hunger.

475
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:26,197
But there is a new will to live.

476
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:30,181
We had to build schools and find teachers
and then teach the teachers.

477
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:34,726
We helped them start a free press
and institute a parliamentary government.

478
00:39:35,395 --> 00:39:37,834
They had their first free
election in 14 years.

479
00:39:38,387 --> 00:39:40,399
It had been so long
they didn't know what to do.

480
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:43,361
It was like handing
the village drunk a glass of water.

481
00:39:44,998 --> 00:39:49,116
What I want to point out is that
it's a tough, thankless, lonely job.

482
00:39:49,898 --> 00:39:51,881
We're trying to lick it as well as we can.

483
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:54,997
You might as well know,
some of us get out of line occasionally.

484
00:39:55,957 --> 00:39:58,126
But remember this.
For the first time in history,

485
00:39:58,638 --> 00:40:02,359
you are asking the same generation of
soldiers to be both valorous and wise.

486
00:40:03,507 --> 00:40:05,185
- Mighty fine.
- Well said.

487
00:40:05,623 --> 00:40:08,679
I sure hope our chairman has
made notes of that speech of yours.

488
00:40:09,314 --> 00:40:11,275
I think it should be
incorporated in our report.

489
00:40:11,681 --> 00:40:14,216
Colonel, we buy every
word of it, all of us.

490
00:40:15,436 --> 00:40:16,323
I don't.

491
00:40:18,053 --> 00:40:21,901
I wouldn't think of buying it. I'm surprised
at my colleagues' low sales resistance.

492
00:40:22,642 --> 00:40:25,363
Miss Frost, this attitude calls
for some explanation.

493
00:40:26,051 --> 00:40:28,033
Colonel Plummer, in your eloquent speech,

494
00:40:28,522 --> 00:40:30,504
which I'm sure you've made 50 times,

495
00:40:30,993 --> 00:40:34,017
you used the phrase "Some of our boys
may get out of line sometimes."

496
00:40:34,643 --> 00:40:38,064
That is a masterpiece of understatement.

497
00:40:38,751 --> 00:40:40,890
What are you driving at?

498
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:43,372
In your effort to civilise this country,
our boys are becoming barbarians.

499
00:40:43,861 --> 00:40:46,488
- I explained on that tour...
- I know all about those tours.

500
00:40:47,063 --> 00:40:50,911
You put blinkers on us and make sure
we only see what you want us to see.

501
00:40:51,765 --> 00:40:54,757
Then you give us pamphlets,
statistics, a rousing speech

502
00:40:55,384 --> 00:40:58,012
and ship us back a little more
bamboozled than when we came.

503
00:40:58,647 --> 00:41:01,025
We could have learned
as much from Reader's Digest.

504
00:41:01,578 --> 00:41:04,445
- This is very embarrassing, Colonel.
- Go on, Miss Frost.

505
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:07,552
Well, I don't like blinkers.
I look in all directions

506
00:41:08,116 --> 00:41:11,202
and when I suspect dirt's been swept
under a carpet, I turn up that carpet.

507
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:15,280
- What carpet? What dirt?
- What dirt?

508
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:19,439
- One day and this is filled with it.
- Please particularise.

509
00:41:20,784 --> 00:41:23,193
Gls consorting with German Fräuleins...

510
00:41:23,736 --> 00:41:24,988
Fraternisation is legal.

511
00:41:25,372 --> 00:41:27,907
in wide-open, shameless,
black-market nightclubs.

512
00:41:30,002 --> 00:41:33,267
So we close them and our boys sneak off
to places in the Russian sector,

513
00:41:33,933 --> 00:41:36,531
or the British, or in the French,
and there's another thing.

514
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:39,961
This is off the record.
Those places attract a lot of scum

515
00:41:40,576 --> 00:41:43,579
and we clean it up by cracking down
with a surprise raid once in a while.

516
00:41:43,985 --> 00:41:47,866
Notorious Nazi entertainers parading
themselves before our boys,

517
00:41:48,615 --> 00:41:50,784
- is that off the record too?
- For instance?

518
00:41:51,473 --> 00:41:55,654
I am specifically referring
to one Erika von Schlütow,

519
00:41:56,447 --> 00:42:00,597
who works at a dive called the Lorelei,
15 Hagenbachstraße.

520
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,808
How can a creature...

521
00:42:08,481 --> 00:42:10,795
I insist on a satisfactory explanation.

522
00:42:11,546 --> 00:42:14,601
I must ask the Congresswoman
to drop this particular matter.

523
00:42:15,226 --> 00:42:17,949
- Why?
- Some things must be left to our discretion.

524
00:42:18,813 --> 00:42:22,235
Colonel Plummer, I didn't go for
the blinkers. Now, don't try a muzzle.

525
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,968
The last time someone wanted to gag me,
he tried it with a mink coat

526
00:42:26,571 --> 00:42:30,295
but I never let go until the president
of that particular ship company

527
00:42:31,024 --> 00:42:32,275
wound up in jail,

528
00:42:32,662 --> 00:42:35,071
even though I did get
pneumonia that winter.

529
00:42:38,511 --> 00:42:40,889
Herr Maier, this is the second time
we've had complaints.

530
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:44,518
I don't think it's a good idea
that your son... What's his name?

531
00:42:45,154 --> 00:42:46,040
Gerhard.

532
00:42:46,374 --> 00:42:48,918
That Gerhard should draw swastikas
all over the neighbourhood.

533
00:42:53,434 --> 00:42:56,207
- I will break his arm.
- We've dissolved the Gestapo.

534
00:42:56,843 --> 00:43:00,962
No food, Bürschchen.
I will lock him into a dark room.

535
00:43:01,755 --> 00:43:03,424
Why not just shove him in a gas chamber?

536
00:43:03,735 --> 00:43:04,831
Yes, Herr Kapitän.

537
00:43:05,195 --> 00:43:07,207
Listen, we've done away
with concentration camps.

538
00:43:07,698 --> 00:43:10,388
Take him round to a G YA,
one of our German youth clubs.

539
00:43:11,357 --> 00:43:13,943
Some baseball and a little less
heel-clicking is what he needs.

540
00:43:14,903 --> 00:43:16,822
Here's the address. Ask for Sergeant Breen.

541
00:43:17,302 --> 00:43:18,522
Yes, Herr Kapitän.

542
00:43:20,054 --> 00:43:22,463
I mean, thank you, Herr Kapitän.

543
00:43:23,109 --> 00:43:24,424
Auf Wiedersehen.

544
00:43:24,986 --> 00:43:26,603
Come, Bürschchen.

545
00:43:34,214 --> 00:43:36,937
- Captain Pringle is wanted in 112.
- Who's that?

546
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,440
That Congress dame,
whatever her name is.

547
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,504
- Wants to see me?
- You, sir.

548
00:43:41,931 --> 00:43:43,558
- Now?
- Now. She's clucking like a hen.

549
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:46,550
You'd better get there
before she lays an egg.

550
00:44:04,028 --> 00:44:05,529
- Captain Pringle reporting.
- Hello.

551
00:44:07,405 --> 00:44:10,273
- Lorelei, how do you spell it?
- Lorelei?

552
00:44:10,888 --> 00:44:12,662
l-E or E-I at the end?

553
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:14,235
E-I.

554
00:44:14,612 --> 00:44:15,498
Thank you.

555
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,744
Captain Pringle, my belief in the army
has been shaken to the core.

556
00:44:23,475 --> 00:44:26,342
- Really?
- I can't trust anybody in uniform.

557
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:30,085
- Now, please...
- With one single exception, you.

558
00:44:32,285 --> 00:44:33,256
Thank you, ma'am.

559
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,341
I trust you because we're both Iowans.

560
00:44:35,799 --> 00:44:38,761
- Right back at you, Miss Frost.
- Moreover, you're a hard worker.

561
00:44:39,481 --> 00:44:41,587
Perhaps you work too hard. You look tired.

562
00:44:42,233 --> 00:44:44,579
Well, I hoped it didn't show.

563
00:44:45,882 --> 00:44:47,959
That is ink, Captain Pringle.

564
00:44:48,636 --> 00:44:50,951
- So it is.
- Captain, I need your help.

565
00:44:51,482 --> 00:44:53,892
I want some additional data
on Fräulein von Schlütow.

566
00:44:55,414 --> 00:44:57,269
The one with the umlaut.

567
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:00,034
- Oh, her.
- There must be a file on that woman.

568
00:45:00,711 --> 00:45:04,163
- Of course there is. Only it's not here.
- It isn't?

569
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:07,082
I asked for it
and I was told it's gone to Nürnberg.

570
00:45:07,594 --> 00:45:10,283
On account of the trials,
a lot of files have been sent there.

571
00:45:10,867 --> 00:45:12,484
- I see.
- I asked around, though.

572
00:45:12,922 --> 00:45:15,205
- Did you find anything?
- Nothing important. Gossip.

573
00:45:15,737 --> 00:45:18,145
Are you sure? No fire with all that smoke?

574
00:45:18,699 --> 00:45:21,170
She may have known
a couple of minor party members.

575
00:45:21,722 --> 00:45:23,798
Nothing worth your attention.
Small fry, I'd say.

576
00:45:24,298 --> 00:45:26,384
- All right, ma'am, we're ready to go.
- Thank you.

577
00:45:27,364 --> 00:45:30,054
A warrant officer said he'd seen her
in an old newsreel,

578
00:45:30,628 --> 00:45:33,037
so I sent for the film
from the Signal Corp.

579
00:45:37,697 --> 00:45:39,647
"The Week In Pictures."

580
00:45:42,421 --> 00:45:44,923
This is a little Nazi
get-together in Breslau.

581
00:45:51,264 --> 00:45:53,954
That's Goebbels telling them
how they're winning the war.

582
00:45:59,992 --> 00:46:02,889
Opening of the opera with Lohengrin
and famous guests.

583
00:46:03,505 --> 00:46:05,736
(Frost) They fiddled big
while Berlin burned.

584
00:46:06,258 --> 00:46:07,969
Lohengrin, you know, swan song.

585
00:46:12,098 --> 00:46:16,185
Now we're getting someplace.
I wonder what holds up that dress.

586
00:46:17,218 --> 00:46:18,897
Must be that German willpower.

587
00:46:19,658 --> 00:46:21,889
- Who's that man?
- I think it's Birgel.

588
00:46:22,399 --> 00:46:24,287
- Who?
- Hans Otto Birgel.

589
00:46:24,944 --> 00:46:26,403
Who is Hans Otto Birgel?

590
00:46:26,822 --> 00:46:30,367
He had something to do
with the Gestapo. He's dead.

591
00:46:31,065 --> 00:46:33,902
- Killed himself when the Russians came.
- An important party member?

592
00:46:36,216 --> 00:46:37,436
So-so.

593
00:46:38,855 --> 00:46:41,231
Well, she must be his girlfriend.

594
00:46:41,784 --> 00:46:44,048
Maybe she doesn't know him.
Maybe she had a dizzy spell

595
00:46:44,569 --> 00:46:47,437
and the first thing she could catch
was his... elbow.

596
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:15,673
That's enough. Thank you.

597
00:47:18,624 --> 00:47:21,920
Well, we've learned one thing.
No small fry is she.

598
00:47:22,702 --> 00:47:25,600
- I guess not.
- That a Nazi woman like that should...

599
00:47:26,217 --> 00:47:28,677
I'll see she discontinues
her appearances as an entertainer.

600
00:47:29,063 --> 00:47:31,107
- Will that be satisfactory?
- It will not.

601
00:47:31,608 --> 00:47:33,869
What would you suggest, shave her head?

602
00:47:34,391 --> 00:47:35,725
- I'm not after her head.
- Well?

603
00:47:36,028 --> 00:47:39,198
It's common talk that an officer
in the army is protecting her.

604
00:47:39,886 --> 00:47:42,972
- It's his head I'm after.
- You really think an officer?

605
00:47:43,609 --> 00:47:44,923
Incredible as it may seem.

606
00:47:45,413 --> 00:47:47,395
Now, let's use some common sense.

607
00:47:47,989 --> 00:47:50,982
That man is not giving her
his protection for platonic reasons.

608
00:47:51,607 --> 00:47:53,035
- Granted?
- Granted.

609
00:47:53,556 --> 00:47:55,840
Of course the association is undercover.

610
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:58,687
He's not stupid enough
to entertain her at his billet.

611
00:47:59,229 --> 00:48:02,284
- I guess that's right.
- We can therefore assume he visits her.

612
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,319
Very logical.

613
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:08,552
Therefore, to catch him,
we must watch her place.

614
00:48:09,218 --> 00:48:10,471
Smart idea.

615
00:48:10,857 --> 00:48:12,868
- You know where she lives?
- I can find out.

616
00:48:13,671 --> 00:48:16,508
And I shall watch it
day and night... personally.

617
00:48:17,113 --> 00:48:19,219
No, we'll watch it together, the two of us.

618
00:48:19,865 --> 00:48:22,858
- We will?
- Yes. I want to be an eyewitness.

619
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:26,205
I want to see that man myself
and face him down.

620
00:48:27,134 --> 00:48:29,146
Can you afford the time, Miss Frost?

621
00:48:29,635 --> 00:48:32,629
Any time it requires.
This I intend to make my case in point.

622
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,922
You'll go to the General?

623
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:38,833
I will, and to the War Department
and to the President.

624
00:48:40,356 --> 00:48:43,078
And if that doesn't do it,
I'll see Gabriel Heater.

625
00:48:56,049 --> 00:48:58,488
It's well after curfew.
I wonder if he's coming tonight.

626
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:01,481
- He'll be here.
- Yeah?

627
00:49:02,242 --> 00:49:05,299
I don't think you understand
about arrangements like this.

628
00:49:05,924 --> 00:49:08,062
They work 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.

629
00:49:08,572 --> 00:49:09,793
Does the CIO know about this?

630
00:49:13,859 --> 00:49:16,727
Are you sure there aren't
any back stairs to that apartment?

631
00:49:17,341 --> 00:49:18,833
There isn't even any back wall.

632
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:21,629
She must be waiting for somebody.
Why leave the lights on?

633
00:49:22,107 --> 00:49:24,974
Maybe she's knitting
or putting up pickled peaches.

634
00:49:25,902 --> 00:49:28,041
Only we know better.

635
00:49:32,785 --> 00:49:34,526
Pickled peaches.

636
00:49:36,341 --> 00:49:39,395
I bet you miss Iowa. I do already.

637
00:49:41,283 --> 00:49:44,004
- It's changed since you've been there.
- Yeah?

638
00:49:44,588 --> 00:49:47,029
A lot has happened, especially in Murdoch.

639
00:49:47,572 --> 00:49:49,553
- Do you remember Union Street?
- Mm-hm.

640
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:54,213
Well, they've changed the name.
Now it's called Iwo Jima Boulevard.

641
00:49:55,267 --> 00:49:58,165
- That's news.
- And there was a post office scandal.

642
00:49:58,781 --> 00:50:01,095
- Yeah?
- About the new mural in the post office.

643
00:50:02,221 --> 00:50:04,421
The town collected $2,000
to hire a painter.

644
00:50:04,933 --> 00:50:07,529
The mayor got his cousin
from Chicago to do it.

645
00:50:08,697 --> 00:50:10,554
- That's nice.
- It was 80 feet long.

646
00:50:11,022 --> 00:50:12,482
Supposed to be Custer's last stand.

647
00:50:12,868 --> 00:50:15,954
After the cousin left town,
they found out it wasn't an original.

648
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:18,791
He copied the whole thing from a beer ad.

649
00:50:20,877 --> 00:50:24,692
- There was an awful lot of trouble.
- You take Iowa seriously, don't you?

650
00:50:25,434 --> 00:50:27,320
Yes, I guess I do. I like it. Don't you?

651
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:32,398
We won a lot of honours last year,
all the 4H prizes.

652
00:50:33,192 --> 00:50:34,744
It's getting a little chilly.

653
00:50:35,173 --> 00:50:37,947
We had the lowest juvenile delinquency rate
until two months ago.

654
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:39,458
What happened?

655
00:50:39,803 --> 00:50:42,212
A boy in Des Moines took
a blowtorch to his grandmother.

656
00:50:42,754 --> 00:50:45,100
We fell clear down to 16th place.
It was humiliating.

657
00:50:57,999 --> 00:50:59,312
What's that?

658
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:02,149
- Crickets.
- Something dropped.

659
00:51:02,691 --> 00:51:04,703
- How's that?
- Something metallic.

660
00:51:05,266 --> 00:51:06,726
Metallic?

661
00:51:12,712 --> 00:51:14,141
Look, it's a key.

662
00:51:14,797 --> 00:51:16,685
A key? Whatever for?

663
00:51:17,164 --> 00:51:19,792
Evidently the man honks the horn
and that's the signal.

664
00:51:20,365 --> 00:51:22,471
You know more about
these things than I do.

665
00:51:22,983 --> 00:51:24,598
(Erika) Johnny? Johnny?

666
00:51:29,906 --> 00:51:31,586
Where are you, Johnny?

667
00:51:32,722 --> 00:51:34,035
Johnny?

668
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:41,001
- Johnny.
- There are a lot of Johnnys in the army.

669
00:51:41,627 --> 00:51:43,431
- Now we're getting someplace.
- Where?

670
00:51:43,889 --> 00:51:46,173
This eliminates all the Jims,
the Bobs and the Georges.

671
00:51:47,269 --> 00:51:48,885
Too bad his name isn't Zachary.

672
00:51:49,312 --> 00:51:51,231
Yes, that would simplify it.

673
00:52:06,434 --> 00:52:07,654
Johnny.

674
00:52:10,824 --> 00:52:13,358
I... don't know who you refer to.

675
00:52:13,983 --> 00:52:15,475
I am Captain Pringle

676
00:52:15,903 --> 00:52:18,926
and I have with me a member
of the Congress of the United States.

677
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:22,378
Good evening.

678
00:52:23,035 --> 00:52:25,411
- You are Erika von Schlütow?
- I am.

679
00:52:26,028 --> 00:52:29,291
We have reason to believe you're
consorting with a member of our army.

680
00:52:29,959 --> 00:52:32,461
- You have?
- We think you're expecting him now.

681
00:52:33,295 --> 00:52:36,257
- What gives you that idea?
- The key you dropped.

682
00:52:38,342 --> 00:52:40,094
- Maybe I dropped it for the milkman.
- Oh.

683
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:43,962
She dropped it for the milkman.

684
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,394
Fräulein, if that's supposed to be a joke,
you're joking up the wrong tree.

685
00:52:49,092 --> 00:52:51,438
Let me assure you,
we are in no mood for flippancy.

686
00:52:51,981 --> 00:52:53,931
- Facts, if you please.
- Yes, facts.

687
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:59,250
- You are an American woman?
- We'll ask the questions.

688
00:52:59,813 --> 00:53:01,428
- What is the name of the man?
- Yes.

689
00:53:02,273 --> 00:53:04,014
- Johnny.
- Johnny what?

690
00:53:04,714 --> 00:53:06,455
I see you do not believe in lipstick.

691
00:53:07,361 --> 00:53:10,291
And what a curious way to do your hair,
or rather not to do it.

692
00:53:11,011 --> 00:53:12,971
Wait a minute.
Do you know who you're taking to?

693
00:53:13,764 --> 00:53:17,215
An American woman, and I'm a little
disappointed, to tell you the truth.

694
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:22,022
We apparently have a false idea
about the chic American woman.

695
00:53:22,981 --> 00:53:26,151
- I suppose it's publicity from Hollywood.
- You're being impertinent.

696
00:53:27,298 --> 00:53:31,179
Well, I must go back now. There's
a curfew for German civilians, you know.

697
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,294
There sure is.

698
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:38,122
Fräulein von Schlütow,
we increased our national debt

699
00:53:38,946 --> 00:53:42,460
by some $350 billion to win this war.
I would regard it as a waste

700
00:53:43,159 --> 00:53:45,286
- if we didn't eliminate types like you.
- Like you.

701
00:53:50,781 --> 00:53:54,599
Perhaps if you would change
the line of your eyebrows a little.

702
00:53:56,069 --> 00:53:57,319
Gute Nacht.

703
00:53:57,736 --> 00:53:59,812
Gute Nacht,
Captain... whatever your name is.

704
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:08,478
What nerve. What colossal nerve.

705
00:54:09,739 --> 00:54:11,783
We have to remember what
they've been through.

706
00:54:12,284 --> 00:54:14,785
All those bombings left them
kind of wobbly up here.

707
00:54:15,339 --> 00:54:17,779
- I do look awful without make-up.
- You don't.

708
00:54:18,331 --> 00:54:20,928
We were only allowed 60lbs of luggage.
No nonessentials.

709
00:54:21,501 --> 00:54:24,545
Never listen to another woman if you want
to know how you look. Ask a man.

710
00:54:25,923 --> 00:54:28,029
- Come on, ask me.
- I know how I look.

711
00:54:28,634 --> 00:54:31,835
You look charming, positively,
definitely, absolutely charming...

712
00:54:33,054 --> 00:54:35,287
in a... refreshing sort of way.

713
00:54:35,797 --> 00:54:37,966
- Are you being polite?
- Who wants perfume?

714
00:54:38,478 --> 00:54:41,647
Give me the fresh wet smell
of Iowa corn right after it rains.

715
00:54:43,212 --> 00:54:45,588
We had little rain this year,
wonderful corn weather.

716
00:54:46,131 --> 00:54:47,560
I'm sure glad to hear that.

717
00:54:48,956 --> 00:54:51,335
- Now to get back to that woman.
- Must we?

718
00:54:51,876 --> 00:54:54,442
To be as insulting as that,
she must feel awfully safe.

719
00:54:55,004 --> 00:54:56,255
Or just bluffing.

720
00:54:56,642 --> 00:54:59,207
The man behind her
must be really important.

721
00:54:59,916 --> 00:55:01,469
A general or a colonel.

722
00:55:02,105 --> 00:55:03,503
A colonel at least.

723
00:55:06,006 --> 00:55:07,986
What's the full name of that colonel?

724
00:55:08,477 --> 00:55:10,708
- Colonel?
- That Colonel Plummer.

725
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:12,742
- Rufus J Plummer.
- J for what?

726
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:14,452
J for John.

727
00:55:15,328 --> 00:55:16,547
Do you think?

728
00:55:16,923 --> 00:55:20,584
No, not him. It couldn't be him.
He's a married man. A West Pointer.

729
00:55:21,314 --> 00:55:23,597
I've heard of married men,
of West Pointers, even.

730
00:55:24,128 --> 00:55:27,059
- But not Plummer, ma'am, I swear.
- There was a look in his eye.

731
00:55:28,029 --> 00:55:30,135
If we could only get our hands on her file.

732
00:55:30,636 --> 00:55:32,179
Who told you it was sent to Nürnberg?

733
00:55:32,377 --> 00:55:36,131
- Second Lieutenant Cook, in charge of files.
- Maybe he's covering up for his colonel.

734
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:40,156
- I'll ask him tomorrow morning.
- No. We'll go there now.

735
00:55:40,833 --> 00:55:42,179
- Where?
- To the files.

736
00:55:42,565 --> 00:55:44,974
In the middle of the night?
Shouldn't we get permission?

737
00:55:45,525 --> 00:55:48,393
Did we get permission
to land in Normandy? Let's go.

738
00:56:03,097 --> 00:56:05,536
Schlütow, Schlütow.

739
00:56:08,038 --> 00:56:10,384
S... SA...

740
00:56:11,658 --> 00:56:14,618
SCH to ST. This is where it would be.

741
00:56:15,307 --> 00:56:17,017
If it is at all, but I don't think it is.

742
00:56:17,393 --> 00:56:19,435
- Well, let's make good and sure.
- Sure.

743
00:56:21,366 --> 00:56:22,711
Come on, open it.

744
00:56:23,837 --> 00:56:26,642
Schlage, Schlangenberg,
Schlagenspitz, Schlitz...

745
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:29,666
Seems that some of them
never got to Milwaukee.

746
00:56:31,595 --> 00:56:34,253
Schliemann, Schlüssel, Schlütow...

747
00:56:34,827 --> 00:56:36,599
- There.
- Here's the Schlütows.

748
00:56:37,058 --> 00:56:41,145
Anton, Emil, Fritz, Gottfried, Waldemar...

749
00:56:42,627 --> 00:56:44,431
- No Erika.
- No Erika.

750
00:56:44,878 --> 00:56:47,257
Told you so. Gone to Nürnberg.
Gone to Nürnberg.

751
00:56:47,976 --> 00:56:49,832
I'll take you back to your billet.

752
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:53,034
Erika von Schlütow.

753
00:56:53,481 --> 00:56:54,941
- Yes?
- It's under von.

754
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:56,244
Oh, no.

755
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:59,207
Like O'Brien. You wouldn't
look under B, you'd look under O.

756
00:56:59,989 --> 00:57:02,584
- All right, let's look under O.
- Under V.

757
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:08,936
- V as in vindictive.
- What was that, Captain?

758
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:11,291
I pity anybody who has you on his trail.

759
00:57:11,741 --> 00:57:13,971
You pity a man who's consorting
with a notorious Nazi?

760
00:57:14,984 --> 00:57:16,412
Von Resnicek, von Reudesheim...

761
00:57:16,829 --> 00:57:19,332
Did it occur to you there might be
extenuating circumstances?

762
00:57:19,885 --> 00:57:22,147
I expect any man in his
country's uniform...

763
00:57:23,013 --> 00:57:27,047
Oh, that one.
You expect him to be an ambassador.

764
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:29,707
A salesman of goodwill. You want him
to stand on the blackened rubble

765
00:57:30,187 --> 00:57:31,897
of what used to be the corner of a street

766
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:34,003
with a sample case of assorted freedoms,

767
00:57:34,462 --> 00:57:36,381
waving the flag and the Bill of Rights.

768
00:57:36,859 --> 00:57:39,029
That's not the way it works.

769
00:57:39,404 --> 00:57:42,334
Suppose you stop and ask yourself
how come he skidded of the road?

770
00:57:42,949 --> 00:57:46,433
- I'll tell you how. No moral brakes.
- That's it, going too fast.

771
00:57:47,371 --> 00:57:49,259
During the war, he couldn't go fast enough.

772
00:57:49,738 --> 00:57:53,346
"Get on that beachhead, through the
tank traps, across the Rhine. Step on it."

773
00:57:54,503 --> 00:57:56,766
Faster, 100 miles an hour,
24 hours a day...

774
00:57:57,287 --> 00:57:59,207
through burning towns.

775
00:58:00,175 --> 00:58:01,855
Then one day the war is over.

776
00:58:02,303 --> 00:58:04,805
You expect him to jam on those brakes
and stop like that.

777
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:07,246
Everybody can't stop like that!

778
00:58:07,726 --> 00:58:10,009
Sometimes you skid, sometimes you go
into a spin...

779
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:12,616
and smash into a tree...

780
00:58:13,117 --> 00:58:16,120
and bash your fenders and scrape those
fine ideals you brought from home.

781
00:58:16,776 --> 00:58:19,007
It's time such wrecks
were hauled into a garage.

782
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:22,908
- Anyone who forgets he's American...
- Don't forget he's also human.

783
00:58:23,595 --> 00:58:25,180
What would you know about that?

784
00:58:27,631 --> 00:58:29,061
Von Schlegel, von Schlittenheim...

785
00:58:29,467 --> 00:58:32,722
The loneliness is stored up right down
to his boots and it's driving him crazy.

786
00:58:33,617 --> 00:58:35,901
One day a pair of
open-toed shoes come along.

787
00:58:36,849 --> 00:58:40,540
You want him to ask questions?
Party affiliation? Social Security number?

788
00:58:41,271 --> 00:58:44,012
Yes, I want him to make sure
he's not doing something subversive.

789
00:58:44,638 --> 00:58:48,456
Are you qualified to call the pitch on this?
What's your life, anyway?

790
00:58:49,196 --> 00:58:51,021
Committees and sessions
and adjournments

791
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,513
and budget cuts and appropriations.

792
00:58:54,034 --> 00:58:57,236
What do you do for laughs? What do you
do for tears for that matter?

793
00:59:00,613 --> 00:59:04,002
For tears... for tears I
cry, Captain Pringle.

794
00:59:04,994 --> 00:59:07,100
It may interest you to know
I once cried for a man

795
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:10,258
- till my eyes were half washed out of my head.
- Not really.

796
00:59:11,604 --> 00:59:15,546
I was on an important subcommittee.
One was a Southern Democrat.

797
00:59:16,515 --> 00:59:18,654
His convictions
were utterly different from mine.

798
00:59:19,154 --> 00:59:21,875
I hated everything he stood for.
I despised his politics.

799
00:59:23,679 --> 00:59:26,370
But I loved him... insanely.

800
00:59:27,955 --> 00:59:30,729
I loved the Southern syrup in his voice.

801
00:59:31,437 --> 00:59:33,022
His mint julep manners.

802
00:59:33,939 --> 00:59:36,599
The way he'd look at me
through his long thick eyelashes

803
00:59:37,423 --> 00:59:39,497
when I was vetoing an amendment.

804
00:59:41,322 --> 00:59:45,265
He'd put his arm around me,
just kind of lazy, like.

805
00:59:47,099 --> 00:59:49,540
Lean his head against my cheek.

806
00:59:50,092 --> 00:59:53,242
His hair had a deep wave in it.

807
00:59:54,712 --> 00:59:57,642
- You know what he was trying to do?
- What?

808
00:59:59,477 --> 01:00:01,280
He was trying to sway my vote.

809
01:00:03,898 --> 01:00:06,401
Once he drove me home
from an all-night meeting,

810
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:09,144
stopped his car on Earl Street.

811
01:00:09,644 --> 01:00:13,158
For no reason at all, he said,
except he was yearning for my lips.

812
01:00:15,421 --> 01:00:17,955
To tell you the truth, I
was yearning for his.

813
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,875
But it would have meant betraying
my platform and my constituents.

814
01:00:23,491 --> 01:00:25,597
- What did you do?
- I filibustered.

815
01:00:26,098 --> 01:00:28,329
- You what?
- I just kept on talking.

816
01:00:28,850 --> 01:00:32,333
The constitution, the Bill of Rights, poems,
Longfellow, anything I could think of.

817
01:00:33,648 --> 01:00:36,671
Von Schloss, von Schlotzing,
von Schlumann, von Schlürmann,

818
01:00:37,755 --> 01:00:39,215
von...

819
01:00:42,729 --> 01:00:45,076
- No other man since the mint julep guy?
- No.

820
01:00:45,753 --> 01:00:48,100
- No more what you call yearning?
- No.

821
01:00:50,248 --> 01:00:52,354
- Sure?
- None of your business.

822
01:00:54,347 --> 01:00:58,225
I've been doing a little yearning
ever since you stepped off that plane.

823
01:00:59,957 --> 01:01:01,302
Captain Pringle!

824
01:01:03,606 --> 01:01:06,108
- Don't!
- Why not? You're not a Nazi.

825
01:01:06,735 --> 01:01:09,392
Don't tell me it's subversive
to kiss a Republican.

826
01:01:15,086 --> 01:01:16,766
I am a Congresswoman.

827
01:01:17,213 --> 01:01:20,176
Yeah. Now I know how I'll cast
my absentee ballot come re-election.

828
01:01:20,967 --> 01:01:23,804
- I'm here on official business.
- This is official.

829
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:26,963
Oh! Now, listen.

830
01:01:27,652 --> 01:01:28,871
Listen.

831
01:01:29,591 --> 01:01:32,760
"Listen, my children, and you shall hear
of the midnight ride of Paul Revere

832
01:01:33,939 --> 01:01:37,516
"On the 18th of April in '75,
hardly a man is now alive

833
01:01:38,226 --> 01:01:40,144
"Who remembers that famous day and year

834
01:01:41,395 --> 01:01:45,181
"He said to his friend, 'lf the British
march by land or sea from the town tonight

835
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:49,413
"'Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch
of the North Church tower as a signal light

836
01:01:50,883 --> 01:01:53,783
"'One if by land and two if by sea

837
01:01:54,397 --> 01:01:57,401
"'And I on the opposite shore shall be
ready to ride and spread the alarm

838
01:01:57,807 --> 01:01:59,851
"'Through every Middlesex village and farm

839
01:02:00,352 --> 01:02:02,887
"'For the country folk
to be up and to arm... '

840
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:08,778
"Then he said 'Good night! '
and, with muffled oar, silent..." Oh!

841
01:02:14,408 --> 01:02:17,308
Now, Congresswoman,
may I have the floor?

842
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:20,925
You are entirely out of order.

843
01:02:21,405 --> 01:02:22,803
Objection overruled.

844
01:02:48,225 --> 01:02:50,697
Just, er, checking up on Paul Revere.

845
01:02:52,959 --> 01:02:54,512
Oh, sure.

846
01:03:57,119 --> 01:03:59,861
This is where you live, Congresswoman.
This is your billet.

847
01:04:02,614 --> 01:04:05,419
I said we're here. What's the matter?

848
01:04:07,558 --> 01:04:10,060
- I just want to die.
- You what?

849
01:04:10,831 --> 01:04:13,095
It's awful. It never should have happened.

850
01:04:13,604 --> 01:04:16,139
Listen, you didn't burn down an orphanage.

851
01:04:16,702 --> 01:04:18,684
You got kissed in a file room. That's all.

852
01:04:19,173 --> 01:04:21,060
- I'm a thief.
- Thief?

853
01:04:21,581 --> 01:04:24,356
The lowest kind of a thief,
stealing another woman's man.

854
01:04:25,441 --> 01:04:26,410
Yeah?

855
01:04:26,765 --> 01:04:28,902
The cake I brought. The
girl you left behind.

856
01:04:29,402 --> 01:04:31,905
She sent a love letter and you fell in love
with the postman.

857
01:04:32,290 --> 01:04:35,409
Those things happen, like electrons,
positive and negative.

858
01:04:36,056 --> 01:04:37,808
- One day they get together and wham!
- No!

859
01:04:38,173 --> 01:04:39,997
No wham.

860
01:04:41,196 --> 01:04:43,698
- We've got to get control of ourselves.
- Can we?

861
01:04:44,439 --> 01:04:46,326
It would be wiser
not to see each other again.

862
01:04:46,868 --> 01:04:50,382
- I suppose it would.
- We can't go on with our investigation.

863
01:04:51,081 --> 01:04:53,709
- So we drop it.
- No. No, I'll go on alone.

864
01:04:55,399 --> 01:04:57,568
- I could enlist the help of the general.
- No.

865
01:04:58,631 --> 01:04:59,789
Why not?

866
01:05:00,163 --> 01:05:04,346
Miss Frost, Congresswoman,
Postman, darling,

867
01:05:05,347 --> 01:05:08,401
to know that you're here and around
and I couldn't see you, I'd go crazy.

868
01:05:09,204 --> 01:05:10,851
We've got to be strong.

869
01:05:11,301 --> 01:05:15,179
This business about Dusty, it's not serious.
It's just a college crush.

870
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:18,579
- I have a dreadful sense of guilt.
- We're not engaged.

871
01:05:19,193 --> 01:05:21,332
I'm not committed in any way.

872
01:05:22,186 --> 01:05:26,555
It would break her heart, the daughter of
the man who swung the 4th Precinct.

873
01:05:27,370 --> 01:05:30,267
No, it won't.
She's a kind of a flighty kid, you know.

874
01:05:30,883 --> 01:05:33,166
She's been engaged to four guys
since I've been gone,

875
01:05:33,699 --> 01:05:35,773
one of them a feed and grain merchant.

876
01:05:36,275 --> 01:05:38,475
Think what a good provider he'd make.

877
01:05:39,476 --> 01:05:41,154
Oh, John...

878
01:05:41,603 --> 01:05:44,376
I don't even know your first name,
Congresswoman darling.

879
01:05:45,430 --> 01:05:47,203
- Phoebe.
- Phoebe.

880
01:05:47,827 --> 01:05:49,142
Isn't that ridiculous?

881
01:05:49,537 --> 01:05:50,967
Not a bit ridiculous.

882
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:56,066
How about a good-night kiss, Phoebe?

883
01:05:58,131 --> 01:05:59,747
Good night.

884
01:06:04,636 --> 01:06:05,981
Good morning.

885
01:06:10,758 --> 01:06:12,373
Good evening.

886
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:19,079
Good gracious.

887
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:33,104
(Man) The problem is how to stop
all this physical human contact...

888
01:06:38,037 --> 01:06:40,569
We just ought to put our foot down
and put it down hard.

889
01:06:41,132 --> 01:06:42,802
- Why, Miss Frost.
- Where have you been?

890
01:06:43,188 --> 01:06:44,898
- We've been worried.
- Won't you join us?

891
01:06:45,273 --> 01:06:47,045
- Miss Frost?
- Miss Frost?

892
01:07:15,783 --> 01:07:18,067
Anything I can do for you?

893
01:07:18,818 --> 01:07:20,101
Not a thing.

894
01:07:43,833 --> 01:07:47,587
- Hans Otto Birgel.
- That's the best we could find, Colonel.

895
01:07:48,975 --> 01:07:51,509
The others without uniform
don't show his face so plainly.

896
01:07:52,145 --> 01:07:55,564
Lovely master race type.
I bet he never tortured anybody.

897
01:07:56,252 --> 01:07:58,568
Not until he made sure
his dachshund had had his dinner.

898
01:07:59,308 --> 01:08:01,748
I want every MP to memorise this puss.

899
01:08:06,377 --> 01:08:09,578
Have 100 copies printed. Send it around
with a detailed description.

900
01:08:10,236 --> 01:08:11,300
Will do.

901
01:08:11,664 --> 01:08:13,803
We've got the trap baited
with the right cheese.

902
01:08:14,312 --> 01:08:16,170
He'll snap at it, sure as shooting.

903
01:08:17,889 --> 01:08:19,047
- I hope.

904
01:08:20,122 --> 01:08:21,404
Come in.

905
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,886
- You wanted to see me, Colonel?
- Yes, Miss Frost.

906
01:08:25,377 --> 01:08:27,086
- That'll be all, Major.
- Yes, sir.

907
01:08:28,817 --> 01:08:30,768
- How is the investigation going?
- The what?

908
01:08:31,248 --> 01:08:33,198
- The investigation.
- Oh, fine.

909
01:08:33,719 --> 01:08:36,128
- Making any progress?
- Slowly. Why?

910
01:08:37,306 --> 01:08:39,745
It seems, in the course of it,
you lost something.

911
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:42,520
- I have?
- This is yours, isn't it?

912
01:08:43,782 --> 01:08:47,441
Yes, thank you very much.
Well, I guess I'd better get some hatpins.

913
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:51,488
It is pretty windy in Berlin,
especially at night.

914
01:08:54,532 --> 01:08:56,816
Well, the whole thing
can be easily explained.

915
01:09:03,749 --> 01:09:07,534
But I hardly think you're in a position
to cast a stone, Colonel Plummer.

916
01:09:08,693 --> 01:09:11,288
- I'm very sorry.
- I think you're brazen.

917
01:09:12,268 --> 01:09:13,155
Am I?

918
01:09:13,488 --> 01:09:16,388
- Having that on your desk.
- Having what on my desk?

919
01:09:17,150 --> 01:09:20,757
I know all about that going
100 miles an hour, then the war is over

920
01:09:21,455 --> 01:09:23,625
but you can't stop like that.

921
01:09:24,135 --> 01:09:26,669
But there is such a thing as discretion.

922
01:09:27,232 --> 01:09:29,891
- What discretion?
- Is this your family?

923
01:09:30,673 --> 01:09:33,207
Yes, and this is our house in Indiana.

924
01:09:33,771 --> 01:09:35,658
- How long have you been married?
- 22 years.

925
01:09:36,138 --> 01:09:39,068
Oh, no. Perhaps it would be a good idea
if you sent for your wife.

926
01:09:39,694 --> 01:09:41,738
She can't come now.
We're expecting a baby.

927
01:09:42,227 --> 01:09:44,333
- A baby?
- I mean, our older daughter is.

928
01:09:45,219 --> 01:09:48,578
I can understand the temptation of
a young man over here but a grandfather...

929
01:09:49,923 --> 01:09:52,488
Really, Colonel Plummer,
you should have your brakes relined.

930
01:10:15,772 --> 01:10:17,452
John. John, now I know.

931
01:10:17,931 --> 01:10:19,391
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

932
01:10:20,089 --> 01:10:22,259
- I found out. There can't be any doubt.
- What?

933
01:10:22,758 --> 01:10:24,250
- He even has her picture.
- Who?

934
01:10:24,677 --> 01:10:25,761
- Colonel Plummer.
- Whose?

935
01:10:26,105 --> 01:10:27,784
- That woman's.
- How come?

936
01:10:28,264 --> 01:10:29,755
I mean, what for?

937
01:10:30,246 --> 01:10:32,101
To look at. He can't keep his eyes off her.

938
01:10:32,572 --> 01:10:35,439
It must be a mistake.
Maybe it's somebody who looks like her.

939
01:10:36,503 --> 01:10:38,182
Should I talk it over with the general?

940
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:40,402
- I wouldn't. Not the general.

941
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:44,489
Excuse me. Denazification office,
Captain Pringle speaking.

942
01:10:46,773 --> 01:10:49,307
- Who?
- Johnny, what has happened?

943
01:10:50,215 --> 01:10:52,351
Why didn't you come last night?
I waited for you.

944
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:55,491
Johnny, are you listening?

945
01:10:55,992 --> 01:10:58,525
Of course I am, Lieutenant...

946
01:11:00,204 --> 01:11:02,675
Forrestal.
Lieutenant Forrestal, quartermasters.

947
01:11:03,572 --> 01:11:07,420
Well, Lieutenant, I'm sorry I couldn't
make it. I'm pretty busy these days.

948
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:11,423
Johnny, what's the matter?
This is Erika.

949
01:11:12,311 --> 01:11:13,802
How you talk to me!

950
01:11:14,291 --> 01:11:17,410
Lieutenant, it should not be
too difficult to grasp the situation.

951
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:20,464
I wonder how he got
through officers school.

952
01:11:22,195 --> 01:11:23,696
Oh, someone is with you, is that it?

953
01:11:24,344 --> 01:11:25,929
That is correct, Lieutenant Forrestal.

954
01:11:26,366 --> 01:11:29,162
Is this the son of the secretary of the Navy?
Let me speak with him.

955
01:11:29,537 --> 01:11:33,144
No, this is the army Forrestal,
absolutely no relation.

956
01:11:34,614 --> 01:11:38,097
Lieutenant, I assure you
I'll see you as soon as it's practical.

957
01:11:38,785 --> 01:11:41,164
It may be late,
possibly after your office hours.

958
01:11:42,435 --> 01:11:45,177
- I miss you so, Johnny. I love you.
- I'll make a note of that.

959
01:11:46,439 --> 01:11:48,546
Goodbye, Lieutenant.

960
01:11:49,714 --> 01:11:52,029
Nice kid. We went through
basic training together.

961
01:11:54,656 --> 01:11:56,428
Now, what am I to do about the Colonel?

962
01:11:56,878 --> 01:11:59,901
- I don't know.
- Could he be transferred to Japan?

963
01:12:00,673 --> 01:12:03,331
I don't think so, not Japan.
Not with Tokyo Rose around.

964
01:12:04,635 --> 01:12:06,898
- What do you suggest?
- What do I suggest?

965
01:12:07,702 --> 01:12:10,078
- What do I suggest? Come on!
- Where are you taking me?

966
01:12:10,621 --> 01:12:12,541
Brent, take over for me.
I won't be back today.

967
01:12:13,540 --> 01:12:16,012
Where are you taking me?
We have a meeting with the general.

968
01:12:16,575 --> 01:12:19,578
You don't want to see the general,
you want to see me. I want to see you.

969
01:12:20,151 --> 01:12:23,082
So little time, so much to say.
Don't let's waste a minute.

970
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:26,179
- My investigation...
- I'll handle it after you go.

971
01:12:26,732 --> 01:12:28,901
Send you a full report to Washington.

972
01:12:29,410 --> 01:12:32,039
These few days are ours.
They're all we've got.

973
01:12:32,925 --> 01:12:34,541
You dreadful man.

974
01:12:34,979 --> 01:12:37,148
Come on. Let's get the Jeep
and drive out to Wannsee.

975
01:12:37,243 --> 01:12:41,308
It's wide and green and I know a spot
that looks like a bend in the Mississippi.

976
01:12:42,737 --> 01:12:44,198
Let's.

977
01:13:02,215 --> 01:13:04,198
Johnny, come on.

978
01:13:05,147 --> 01:13:07,429
- Faster. Faster.
- Hi.

979
01:13:07,992 --> 01:13:11,506
Two days and two nights, what has
mein kleiner Liebling being doing?

980
01:13:13,843 --> 01:13:16,314
He's been making charm
with the bloodhounds.

981
01:13:16,867 --> 01:13:18,816
How are things going
with the Congresswoman?

982
01:13:19,307 --> 01:13:21,778
- All right. We're engaged.
- You're what?

983
01:13:22,330 --> 01:13:24,071
Better than having my head chopped off.

984
01:13:24,521 --> 01:13:28,212
- I didn't know you were that deep in.
- What deep? How deep?

985
01:13:28,941 --> 01:13:31,257
Why didn't you tell me
you and Birgel were like that?

986
01:13:31,798 --> 01:13:33,967
- He's dead.
- Having your hand kissed by Hitler.

987
01:13:34,479 --> 01:13:36,001
I hope you had it sterilised.

988
01:13:36,419 --> 01:13:38,733
Looked as if he had rat poison
in that moustache.

989
01:13:39,275 --> 01:13:40,526
Don't talk like that.

990
01:13:41,778 --> 01:13:44,707
Why not?
How much of a Nazi were you, anyway?

991
01:13:45,605 --> 01:13:47,983
Johnny, what does it matter,
a woman's politics?

992
01:13:48,671 --> 01:13:52,425
Women pick out whatever's in fashion
and change it like a spring hat.

993
01:13:53,258 --> 01:13:57,439
Yeah. Last year it was
a little number with a swastika on it.

994
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:01,308
This year it's ostrich feathers,
red, white and blue.

995
01:14:02,446 --> 01:14:05,188
Next year a hammer, maybe, and a sickle.

996
01:14:05,896 --> 01:14:09,192
Oh, Johnny, we must not say
mean words to each other.

997
01:14:10,901 --> 01:14:14,656
When you say you are engaged,
that is only until her plane leaves, huh?

998
01:14:15,385 --> 01:14:16,752
What else?

999
01:14:17,482 --> 01:14:19,828
- I love you so very much.
- You do?

1000
01:14:20,369 --> 01:14:22,779
You're the only man I ever wanted to marry.

1001
01:14:25,239 --> 01:14:27,158
That's mighty white of you.

1002
01:14:27,846 --> 01:14:31,756
I want to go with you to America.
I want to climb up the Statue of Liberty.

1003
01:14:32,685 --> 01:14:35,093
You want to get down
that basement at Fort Knox.

1004
01:14:36,262 --> 01:14:38,148
I want to be where you are.

1005
01:14:38,670 --> 01:14:42,216
Yeah, I can just imagine you
in Iowa in blue jeans,

1006
01:14:42,914 --> 01:14:44,832
going on a hay ride to the old mill.

1007
01:14:45,312 --> 01:14:46,773
I would love that.

1008
01:14:49,274 --> 01:14:51,746
Mmm, gently, baby, it's Mother's Day.

1009
01:14:53,207 --> 01:14:55,646
Cut it out, you blonde flamethrower.

1010
01:14:56,657 --> 01:14:58,086
Cut it out, I said.

1011
01:15:02,675 --> 01:15:04,322
Did you ever kiss the Congresswoman?

1012
01:15:05,249 --> 01:15:06,502
Sure I did.

1013
01:15:08,033 --> 01:15:11,184
- Did she kiss you?
- What kind of a question is that?

1014
01:15:11,830 --> 01:15:15,249
It's a very important question. What
do you do when you're alone together?

1015
01:15:19,024 --> 01:15:22,111
Oh... we sit, hold hands...

1016
01:15:23,624 --> 01:15:25,854
- whistle Shine On Harvest Moon.
- (Laughs)

1017
01:15:27,376 --> 01:15:29,577
- What's so funny?
- You hold hands?

1018
01:15:30,089 --> 01:15:32,319
Sure. Nice people do, you know.

1019
01:15:34,093 --> 01:15:36,783
You're so naive, you Americans.

1020
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:38,650
So we are. So what of it?

1021
01:15:39,618 --> 01:15:43,436
That funny little woman with a face
like a scrubbed kitchen floor.

1022
01:15:44,635 --> 01:15:46,000
Yeah?

1023
01:15:50,589 --> 01:15:54,072
I have some vodka from the Russian sector
and I had the phonograph fixed.

1024
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:57,075
- Would you like to hear some music?
- No thanks.

1025
01:15:57,616 --> 01:15:59,785
- Thanks a lot but no thanks.
- You're going?

1026
01:16:00,287 --> 01:16:02,883
- I got an early formation.
- You'll come back tomorrow night?

1027
01:16:04,291 --> 01:16:06,917
I imagine so, sterling character that I am.

1028
01:16:08,117 --> 01:16:09,430
So long.

1029
01:16:27,356 --> 01:16:29,212
- Miss Frost?
- Miss Frost?

1030
01:16:30,942 --> 01:16:33,571
- We're waiting for you.
- Dinner, Miss Frost.

1031
01:16:34,384 --> 01:16:36,667
- Did you call me?
- It's a quarter of eight.

1032
01:16:37,210 --> 01:16:39,097
We're going to the
officers' mess for dinner.

1033
01:16:39,609 --> 01:16:42,330
I was sort of planning on a quiet evening.

1034
01:16:43,017 --> 01:16:44,384
Don't you feel well, Miss Frost?

1035
01:16:44,790 --> 01:16:47,388
I feel fine.
I have a kind of a headache, that's all.

1036
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:49,848
Would you make
my excuses to the colonel?

1037
01:16:50,328 --> 01:16:51,944
- Sure will.
- Shall we bring you a sandwich maybe?

1038
01:16:52,372 --> 01:16:54,291
Cheese? Chicken? Ham?

1039
01:16:54,989 --> 01:16:57,918
Anything. Thank you very much.
Good evening, gentlemen.

1040
01:16:59,337 --> 01:17:01,078
Maybe we shouldn't leave her alone.

1041
01:17:01,526 --> 01:17:05,104
Maybe we should take her temperature.
Quite a lot of typhoid fever in Berlin.

1042
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:12,570
Oh, good evening. I came to see Miss Frost.

1043
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:14,572
Go on in. We're going out.

1044
01:17:16,282 --> 01:17:18,972
One might suspect
Cupid had a hand in this.

1045
01:17:19,545 --> 01:17:22,382
If we didn't know Miss Frost.
You can't shoot an arrow through steel.

1046
01:17:24,383 --> 01:17:26,699
Phoebe... Phoebe!

1047
01:17:36,355 --> 01:17:37,751
Coming, John.

1048
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:06,604
Well!

1049
01:18:09,826 --> 01:18:12,361
- Do I look all right?
- Where did you get it?

1050
01:18:12,924 --> 01:18:15,886
- At the Brandenburg Gate.
- The black market? You didn't.

1051
01:18:16,510 --> 01:18:20,514
Well, I did. All I wanted was a lipstick
and something for my eyebrows

1052
01:18:21,277 --> 01:18:23,967
but a woman had this over
the handlebars of her bicycle

1053
01:18:24,582 --> 01:18:26,197
and I gave her my typewriter for it.

1054
01:18:26,626 --> 01:18:28,576
The shoes were six extra
typewriter ribbons.

1055
01:18:29,065 --> 01:18:31,901
- Phoebe, for the love of Mike.
- Don't scold me.

1056
01:18:32,506 --> 01:18:34,341
I know I shouldn't have
but I simply had to.

1057
01:18:34,561 --> 01:18:38,597
This is our last evening and I wanted
to look so pretty and I look just awful.

1058
01:18:39,608 --> 01:18:43,821
It's like a circus tent in mourning
for an elephant that died.

1059
01:18:44,623 --> 01:18:47,001
- It's no such thing.
- I'm not blind.

1060
01:18:47,542 --> 01:18:50,963
I tried to fix it but maybe
I'd better go up and put my suit on.

1061
01:18:52,276 --> 01:18:55,823
It is kind of high. What is it,
a turtleneck evening gown?

1062
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:59,931
Well, it was a little lower but I fixed it.

1063
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:02,121
You sure did.

1064
01:19:02,923 --> 01:19:06,073
Now, we takes this pin from here,
where it's just in the way,

1065
01:19:07,272 --> 01:19:09,961
and put it back here
where it can earn its pay.

1066
01:19:10,536 --> 01:19:12,214
It looked so lovely on the bicycle.

1067
01:19:12,663 --> 01:19:15,290
Now, stop it. You dressed for me
and to me you look good.

1068
01:19:16,249 --> 01:19:19,086
John, where did you learn
so much about women's clothes?

1069
01:19:20,034 --> 01:19:21,682
My mother wore women's clothes.

1070
01:19:22,683 --> 01:19:25,978
Oh, John, you're simply adorable.
Do you know it?

1071
01:19:27,272 --> 01:19:29,377
Who am I to argue with a Congresswoman?

1072
01:19:30,201 --> 01:19:31,881
You've got too much junk on your mouth.

1073
01:19:32,319 --> 01:19:34,175
- Have I?
- Now, hold still.

1074
01:19:36,812 --> 01:19:38,366
Now... we're in business.

1075
01:19:41,056 --> 01:19:43,194
We forgot your sable.

1076
01:19:47,773 --> 01:19:50,087
You'll be quite a thing
at that officers' mess.

1077
01:19:50,828 --> 01:19:53,486
- I don't want to go there.
- Where do you want to eat?

1078
01:19:54,071 --> 01:19:55,926
I thought some civilian place.

1079
01:19:56,395 --> 01:19:57,396
In Berlin?

1080
01:19:58,377 --> 01:20:00,515
The place where that singer...
You know, that place.

1081
01:20:01,786 --> 01:20:03,987
- You don't want to go to that sewer.
- Yes, I do.

1082
01:20:04,509 --> 01:20:06,739
I want it dark and gay and with music.

1083
01:20:07,876 --> 01:20:12,516
<i>Want to buy some illusions slightly used?</i>

1084
01:20:13,622 --> 01:20:15,509
<i>Second-hand</i>

1085
01:20:16,886 --> 01:20:19,576
<i>They were lovely illusions, reaching high</i>

1086
01:20:20,337 --> 01:20:23,851
<i>Built on sand</i>

1087
01:20:25,968 --> 01:20:28,961
<i>They had a touch of paradise</i>

1088
01:20:30,284 --> 01:20:33,518
<i>A spell you can't explain</i>

1089
01:20:35,614 --> 01:20:38,607
<i>For in this crazy paradise</i>

1090
01:20:39,888 --> 01:20:43,246
<i>You are in love with pain</i>

1091
01:20:45,948 --> 01:20:50,525
<i>Want to buy some illusions slightly used?</i>

1092
01:20:51,963 --> 01:20:53,914
<i>Just like new</i>

1093
01:20:55,854 --> 01:20:58,721
<i>Such romantic illusions</i>

1094
01:20:59,681 --> 01:21:03,256
<i>And they're all about you</i>

1095
01:21:05,529 --> 01:21:09,252
<i>I'd sell them all for a penny</i>

1096
01:21:10,399 --> 01:21:13,788
<i>They make pretty souvenirs</i>

1097
01:21:16,207 --> 01:21:19,326
<i>Take my lovely illusions</i>

1098
01:21:20,347 --> 01:21:22,693
<i>Some for laughs</i>

1099
01:21:23,966 --> 01:21:27,166
<i>Some for tears</i>

1100
01:21:36,113 --> 01:21:39,138
- Look, it's a hollow bottle.
- That's where the profit is.

1101
01:21:39,763 --> 01:21:41,713
There should be
a Congressional investigation.

1102
01:21:42,203 --> 01:21:44,747
- Second the motion.
- Let's investigate another bottle first.

1103
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:47,522
- More champagne.
- Jawohl.

1104
01:21:48,501 --> 01:21:50,515
Hold my hand, John.

1105
01:21:52,047 --> 01:21:53,235
Sure.

1106
01:21:54,799 --> 01:21:56,385
Oh, John...

1107
01:21:57,376 --> 01:21:59,575
I'm so happy, I'm in heaven.

1108
01:22:00,743 --> 01:22:04,164
Not that I was unhappy before.
I was just drifting.

1109
01:22:04,956 --> 01:22:08,219
That's it. Drifting on
a grey sea all alone.

1110
01:22:08,992 --> 01:22:10,910
It's not bad but suddenly you get scared.

1111
01:22:11,389 --> 01:22:15,113
You need another voice,
so you hoist up your heart and you wait

1112
01:22:16,092 --> 01:22:19,023
and nobody passes by, just grey waves.

1113
01:22:19,711 --> 01:22:23,464
Your heart gets frayed,
lashed by the night winds and rain.

1114
01:22:24,299 --> 01:22:28,022
So you haul it down, what's left of it,
and you resign yourself...

1115
01:22:29,451 --> 01:22:32,776
Then suddenly out of nowhere
comes a boat so unexpected,

1116
01:22:33,454 --> 01:22:35,863
all white sails on the horizon.

1117
01:22:36,406 --> 01:22:38,417
To you, my beautiful boat.

1118
01:22:40,692 --> 01:22:42,369
Phoebe, you make me feel awful.

1119
01:22:42,807 --> 01:22:46,228
Well, you are beautiful and you're fun
and you're good to me.

1120
01:22:46,917 --> 01:22:49,877
Stop it. I'm not that good.
Some day you may find...

1121
01:22:50,503 --> 01:22:53,038
You talk an awful lot for a boat.

1122
01:22:54,225 --> 01:22:55,539
To us.

1123
01:23:09,742 --> 01:23:14,444
<i>Want to buy some illusions slightly used?</i>

1124
01:23:15,446 --> 01:23:17,614
<i>Just like new</i>

1125
01:23:18,647 --> 01:23:21,546
<i>Such romantic illusions</i>

1126
01:23:22,235 --> 01:23:25,435

1127
01:23:27,593 --> 01:23:31,015
<i>I'd sell them all for a penny</i>

1128
01:23:32,463 --> 01:23:35,456
<i>They make pretty souvenirs</i>

1129
01:23:37,510 --> 01:23:40,233
<i>Take my lovely illusions</i>

1130
01:23:41,295 --> 01:23:43,370
<i>Some for love</i>

1131
01:23:44,809 --> 01:23:48,323
<i>Some for tears</i>

1132
01:23:55,947 --> 01:23:57,312
- Good evening.
- May I?

1133
01:23:59,461 --> 01:24:01,692
- Get another glass, John.
- No thank you.

1134
01:24:04,330 --> 01:24:06,343
My, look at the kitchen floor.

1135
01:24:08,094 --> 01:24:10,472
- Look at what?
- Such a change.

1136
01:24:11,399 --> 01:24:14,142
This dress. This dress is from Iowa?

1137
01:24:14,977 --> 01:24:16,802
Oh, no, Berlin. Do you like it?

1138
01:24:17,864 --> 01:24:21,192
It's stunning but haven't you
got it on backwards? And the hair.

1139
01:24:23,255 --> 01:24:25,518
What did you put in
those pigtails, shoelaces?

1140
01:24:26,039 --> 01:24:27,989
- I like it.
- He likes it.

1141
01:24:29,074 --> 01:24:32,557
I shouldn't have mentioned the eyebrows.
Now her face looks bow-legged.

1142
01:24:33,319 --> 01:24:36,437
Miss von Schlütow, I think
the pianist is looking for you.

1143
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:39,753
Have you ever made any progress
hunting down that man?

1144
01:24:40,618 --> 01:24:42,359
- What man?
- My man.

1145
01:24:44,277 --> 01:24:48,187
Oh, a little progress, only that's all been
postponed on account of another man.

1146
01:24:49,637 --> 01:24:52,266
Look at him. Isn't he beautiful?

1147
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:55,248
Phoebe, please.
She always kids me like that.

1148
01:24:55,789 --> 01:24:59,732
- I know he's not pretty but he's beautiful.
- When are you leaving Berlin?

1149
01:25:00,555 --> 01:25:02,683
- Tomorrow. It's our last night together.
- Too bad.

1150
01:25:03,412 --> 01:25:05,883
What he doesn't know is he's going too.

1151
01:25:06,468 --> 01:25:08,667
- I am?
- I talked it over with the general.

1152
01:25:09,188 --> 01:25:11,473
- It was to be a surprise.
- It is.

1153
01:25:12,004 --> 01:25:13,620
- I can't go.
- Yes, you can.

1154
01:25:14,131 --> 01:25:16,238
He hasn't had a furlough in four years.

1155
01:25:17,572 --> 01:25:21,150
This is a bolt from the blue.
I didn't have the slightest, faintest...

1156
01:25:22,234 --> 01:25:25,163
Miss von Schlütow,
isn't it time for your next number?

1157
01:25:25,778 --> 01:25:27,697
There'll be no next number tonight.

1158
01:25:28,355 --> 01:25:30,523
May I steal
one of your American cigarettes?

1159
01:25:47,427 --> 01:25:50,055
Hey, Pringle.
John, the Colonel's looking for you.

1160
01:25:51,567 --> 01:25:52,964
- Colonel?
- Yelling his head off.

1161
01:25:53,370 --> 01:25:55,539
He's got enough blood
in his eye to sell by the pint.

1162
01:25:56,018 --> 01:25:59,074
- What does he want?
- I don't know. Get down to his office.

1163
01:26:01,337 --> 01:26:03,162
Check! Check! Er...

1164
01:26:03,672 --> 01:26:05,477
Go on. I'll take care of the check. Hurry.

1165
01:26:05,936 --> 01:26:09,657
- I'll drop you on the way.
- I'll take Miss Frost home. Get going.

1166
01:26:10,388 --> 01:26:12,400
Why are you going? It's so nice here.

1167
01:26:12,891 --> 01:26:15,267
- I got to go. Didn't you hear?
- I forbid you.

1168
01:26:15,811 --> 01:26:18,157
- Phoebe, this is the army.
- I don't want you to go.

1169
01:26:18,698 --> 01:26:19,888
I got to go.

1170
01:26:20,274 --> 01:26:23,423
All right. You're in contempt of Congress.

1171
01:26:24,861 --> 01:26:26,812
Take care of our friend. Goodbye.

1172
01:26:27,301 --> 01:26:28,948
Goodbye, Fräulein von Schlütow.

1173
01:26:31,816 --> 01:26:33,985
- How much?
- No, this is on the house.

1174
01:26:34,497 --> 01:26:37,614
- Thank you. Ready, Miss Frost?
- Sit down. Have some champagne.

1175
01:26:38,261 --> 01:26:39,167
Another bottle.

1176
01:26:41,566 --> 01:26:42,755
Sit down.

1177
01:26:46,289 --> 01:26:50,106
No, I really shouldn't
be in a place like this.

1185

Don't suppose you boys
know the Iowa song?

1186
01:28:05,486 --> 01:28:08,020
- Iowa, where's that?
- In the United States, silly.

1187

- Since when?
- 1846.

1188

No kidding.

1189
01:28:19,470 --> 01:28:22,640
- Would you like to play it?
- We'll play it but we don't like it.

1190
01:28:25,486 --> 01:28:27,228
- My old campaign song.
- Sing it.

1191
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:29,824
- No.
- You must. You asked for it.

1192
01:28:30,325 --> 01:28:33,099
Maybe there's some boats around.
Who knows? Go on.

get out their papers.

1208
01:30:17,457 --> 01:30:18,552
(Frost) Whoo-hoo!

1209
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:27,268
Jawohl!

1210
01:30:29,177 --> 01:30:30,209
- Oh, will you...

1211
01:30:31,648 --> 01:30:32,900
Where are we going?

1212
01:30:35,089 --> 01:30:37,071
Pretty hat. Let me try it on.

1213
01:30:58,019 --> 01:31:00,648
What's this? What's happening?
Where are we going?

1214
01:31:02,545 --> 01:31:05,110
- To the police station. This is a raid.
- A what?

1215
01:31:05,673 --> 01:31:09,093
- A raid. We have one every other week.
- That's ridiculous.

1216
01:31:09,782 --> 01:31:11,284
They want to check up on our papers.

1217
01:31:11,658 --> 01:31:13,766
We Germans have to have
our papers in order.

1218
01:31:14,265 --> 01:31:16,153
But I'm not a German. They have no right...

1219
01:31:16,633 --> 01:31:20,052
Of course they haven't. There's
no reason why you should submit to it.

1220
01:31:20,981 --> 01:31:24,098
You just tell them who you are and
they'll apologise and let you go home.

1221
01:31:25,787 --> 01:31:28,291
Only on second thoughts, is it a good idea?

1222
01:31:29,021 --> 01:31:31,950
What kind of an impression
will it make on us Germans?

1223
01:31:32,671 --> 01:31:35,444
A Congresswoman of the United States
of America...

1224
01:31:36,079 --> 01:31:37,602
caught at the Lorelei.

1225
01:31:38,593 --> 01:31:41,335
And where did the Honourable
Miss Frost get that dress?

1226
01:31:42,169 --> 01:31:43,849
The black market, maybe?

1227
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:11,752
- Want some coffee, Captain?
- No thanks, sir.

1228
01:32:12,514 --> 01:32:15,047
- Just as well. This is the only cup.
- Yes, sir.

1229
01:32:15,611 --> 01:32:18,175
How about a jigger of poison
with a hemlock chaser?

1230
01:32:18,739 --> 01:32:20,418
More like it, sir.

1231
01:32:21,627 --> 01:32:22,941
Captain...

1232
01:32:23,338 --> 01:32:26,142
I think you have as good
a war record as any man in this town.

1233
01:32:26,913 --> 01:32:30,063
You were on the first team since Normandy
and you sure carried the ball.

1234
01:32:31,126 --> 01:32:33,922
I know you were among the first ten men
to cross the Remagen Bridge.

1235
01:32:36,173 --> 01:32:38,802
I also know why you were in such a hurry.

1236
01:32:40,344 --> 01:32:42,909
Did you know what a hot potato
you had on your hands?

1237
01:32:43,484 --> 01:32:47,457
Well, not quite, sir.
I... had a hunch it was warm, all right.

1238
01:32:49,082 --> 01:32:51,221
Sometimes I wonder
if it isn't a waste of money

1239
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:55,142
to import 11,000 ping-pong tables
for the recreation of you young men.

1240
01:32:57,674 --> 01:32:59,322
Captain, you might as well realise

1241
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:02,357
we've been wise to you
and the von Schlütow woman all along.

1242
01:33:02,930 --> 01:33:04,640
I kind of figured you were peeking.

1243
01:33:05,089 --> 01:33:07,927
The army has been counting on you
for a certain pattern of behaviour.

1244
01:33:08,634 --> 01:33:11,011
- You let us down but good.
- Sorry, sir.

1245
01:33:12,492 --> 01:33:15,485
Since that committee arrived,
you've been playing a double bill

1246
01:33:16,152 --> 01:33:17,904
with the lady from Iowa in the upper half.

1247
01:33:18,343 --> 01:33:20,657
I'd appreciate it
if you leave her out of this, sir.

1248
01:33:22,170 --> 01:33:23,817
You would?

1249
01:33:25,610 --> 01:33:29,520
Pressure has been exerted to have you
go back to the United States for a while.

1250
01:33:30,271 --> 01:33:32,681
- So I've heard.
- You're not going of course.

1251
01:33:33,233 --> 01:33:36,069
Of course. When do proceedings start, sir?

1252
01:33:38,133 --> 01:33:41,711
Captain Pringle, you're to stay away
from that certain party, off limits.

1253
01:33:42,554 --> 01:33:45,724
Suits me fine. It was all washed up
anyway as far as I'm concerned.

1254
01:33:46,381 --> 01:33:49,864
Let's get this straight. You're to stay
away from the Congresswoman.

1255
01:33:53,139 --> 01:33:55,151
Pick up that torch for
Fräulein von Schlütow,

1256
01:33:55,641 --> 01:33:58,301
light it again and carry it in public,
that's an order.

1257
01:33:59,573 --> 01:34:02,377
- Well, how do you do.
- You've heard of Hans Otto Birgel?

1258
01:34:02,982 --> 01:34:05,882
- That was her guy.
- He's hiding out in the American zone.

1259
01:34:06,528 --> 01:34:08,331
- He's dead.
- He's very much alive.

1260
01:34:08,791 --> 01:34:10,375
And thanks to you, he's kicking.

1261
01:34:10,814 --> 01:34:13,409
We had a hunch about him
so we watched Miss von Schlütow.

1262
01:34:14,224 --> 01:34:16,048
Here are three letters we intercepted.

1263
01:34:16,518 --> 01:34:19,521
Someone tipped him off that his girl
has been seeing an American officer.

1264
01:34:21,210 --> 01:34:24,380
He's a jealous rat. He says he's going
to come out and kill you both.

1265
01:34:26,153 --> 01:34:29,050
- That's cute.
- Now, go on back and fan those flames.

1266
01:34:29,771 --> 01:34:31,782
Stick around the Fräulein until he shows.

1267
01:34:33,077 --> 01:34:35,277
I wish I'd never crossed
the Remagen Bridge.

1268
01:34:35,861 --> 01:34:37,539
Sorry, son, that's the way it reads.

1269
01:34:38,091 --> 01:34:41,511
OK, I'm going.
Only I think I'll have that coffee first.

1270
01:34:42,293 --> 01:34:45,161
Never mind the cup.
Just give me a spoonful of the powder.

1271
01:35:09,019 --> 01:35:11,365
- Do you have your passport with you?
- No.

1272
01:35:12,221 --> 01:35:15,244
You just tell them who you are
and they check with the army officials.

1273
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:18,112
- I can't do that.
- Why?

1274
01:35:19,218 --> 01:35:22,575
What if the German papers pick it up
and there are some ugly references?

1275
01:35:23,670 --> 01:35:25,162
May never reach Washington.

1276
01:35:27,142 --> 01:35:30,145
Of course there's one person who could
get you out of all this nastiness.

1277
01:35:31,908 --> 01:35:33,858
Me. I could do it.

1278
01:35:35,046 --> 01:35:37,581
No names mentioned. No aftereffects.

1279
01:35:38,144 --> 01:35:39,822
Just as if it never happened.

1280
01:35:41,344 --> 01:35:43,263
Why should you? You don't like me.

1281
01:35:44,056 --> 01:35:47,476
It's not generosity. We Germans
can't afford to be generous.

1282
01:35:48,164 --> 01:35:49,780
We're very poor.

1283
01:35:50,208 --> 01:35:52,440
It's give and take if we are to survive.

1284
01:35:53,796 --> 01:35:55,380
What have I to give?

1285
01:35:56,297 --> 01:35:57,945
- What do you want to take?

1286
01:37:04,911 --> 01:37:08,081
You know what I told him?
That you were a country cousin of mine.

1287
01:37:08,841 --> 01:37:10,917
Perfectly easy if you have a safe conduct

1288
01:37:11,417 --> 01:37:14,046
with the signature of
a kind American officer on it.

1289
01:37:14,973 --> 01:37:16,923
And you wanted to chop his head off.

1290
01:37:17,476 --> 01:37:20,073
Exactly what is it you want from me,
Fräulein von Schlütow?

1291
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:23,575
Let's go up to my apartment.
It's only a few ruins away from here.

1292
01:37:24,254 --> 01:37:26,631
- No, I'd rather not.
- You'd better.

1293
01:37:27,183 --> 01:37:28,831
You may need a handkerchief.

1294
01:37:33,273 --> 01:37:36,527
This is a beastly thing to do but you must
understand what happened to us here.

1295
01:37:37,414 --> 01:37:40,311
We all become animals
with exactly one instinct left.

1296
01:37:40,928 --> 01:37:42,355
Self-preservation.

1297
01:37:42,835 --> 01:37:45,370
Take me, Miss Frost.
Bombed out a dozen times.

1298
01:37:45,933 --> 01:37:48,248
Everything caved in
and pulled out from under me.

1299
01:37:48,789 --> 01:37:50,802
My country, my possessions, my beliefs.

1300
01:37:51,917 --> 01:37:53,201
Yet somehow I kept going.

1301
01:37:54,003 --> 01:37:57,298
Months in air-raid shelters
crammed in with 5,000 other people.

1302
01:37:58,529 --> 01:38:00,052
I kept going.

1303
01:38:00,583 --> 01:38:03,785
What do you think it was like to be a woman
here when the Russians swept in?

1304
01:38:05,421 --> 01:38:06,849
I kept going.

1305
01:38:07,539 --> 01:38:10,406
It was a living hell...
and then I found a man.

1306
01:38:11,020 --> 01:38:13,618
And through that man,
a roof and a job and food and...

1307
01:38:15,609 --> 01:38:17,528
And I'm not going to lose him.

1308
01:38:18,017 --> 01:38:19,697
What has all this to do with me?

1309
01:38:20,135 --> 01:38:22,970
A little. You see, you want the same man.

1310
01:38:25,150 --> 01:38:28,841
Come on. I told you
you'd need a handkerchief.

1311
01:38:56,673 --> 01:38:59,301
This is how he looked when I met him first.
He was a lieutenant.

1312
01:38:59,769 --> 01:39:02,147
He sat at his desk interrogating me.

1313
01:39:02,689 --> 01:39:05,160
He had such a grim, businesslike face,

1314
01:39:05,964 --> 01:39:08,893
but fortunately I was wearing
my last pair of silk stockings.

1315
01:39:11,416 --> 01:39:13,335
He's really a nice boy.

1316
01:39:13,826 --> 01:39:15,995
You mustn't judge him
by what he did to you.

1317
01:39:16,849 --> 01:39:18,529
He hated it. I know.

1318
01:39:18,967 --> 01:39:22,230
Of course, he would come here
and feel so miserable and sorry for you.

1319
01:39:23,743 --> 01:39:25,660
Your plane is leaving tomorrow, isn't it?

1320
01:39:29,134 --> 01:39:32,460
Don't sit there as if it was the end
of the world. Nothing happened.

1321
01:39:34,420 --> 01:39:36,620
He played a dirty trick on you, that's all.

1322
01:39:37,829 --> 01:39:41,520
So you fly off back home,
wash your hands, wash your lips...

1323
01:39:43,148 --> 01:39:45,316
They've got so much soap
in the United States.

1324
01:39:48,028 --> 01:39:50,311
Sorry. You know this game of love.

1325
01:39:51,021 --> 01:39:53,251
If you want to take
the advice of an old gambler,

1326
01:39:53,763 --> 01:39:56,692
some people are lucky at it,
some people are jinxed.

1327
01:39:58,112 --> 01:40:00,738
They shouldn't even sit down at the table.

1328
01:40:08,623 --> 01:40:10,447
I do not imagine you care to see him again.

1329
01:40:10,917 --> 01:40:13,961
Why not go up the stairs where it's dark
until he comes in and then leave?

1330
01:40:18,643 --> 01:40:20,990
Go on, leave. Haven't you had enough?

1331
01:40:25,390 --> 01:40:27,163
What is this, a big scene?

1332
01:40:27,620 --> 01:40:30,060
We can't keep a gentleman
in the dark, can we?

1333
01:40:31,270 --> 01:40:33,804
Four hours ago you could
have had him court-martialled

1334
01:40:34,472 --> 01:40:37,246
and sent me to a labour camp, not now.

1335
01:40:37,851 --> 01:40:40,593
Not any more. Now you're one of us.

1336
01:40:52,771 --> 01:40:53,960
Hi.

1337
01:41:02,511 --> 01:41:05,567
What's the matter?
No kiss for your little Schweinehund?

1338
01:41:07,599 --> 01:41:11,052
I'm sorry I had to show up with that
Congress dame. She's gone dappy.

1339
01:41:11,740 --> 01:41:14,274
Doesn't mean a thing.
Leaving tomorrow anyway.

1340
01:41:15,076 --> 01:41:17,151
Come on.

1341
01:41:41,375 --> 01:41:42,657
Sorry.

1342
01:41:45,942 --> 01:41:48,904
I guess this is where the funny man says,
"Shall we dance?"

1343
01:41:50,322 --> 01:41:52,585
You are not a funny man, Captain Pringle.

1344
01:41:53,763 --> 01:41:55,774
But you are quite a dancer.

1345
01:41:56,442 --> 01:41:58,549
What a waltz we had.

1346
01:41:59,434 --> 01:42:00,833
Good night.

1347
01:42:40,665 --> 01:42:43,471
Hey, Fräulein!
Hey, Fräulein!

1348
01:42:44,076 --> 01:42:47,130
Hey, Fräulein!
Hey, Fräulein!

1349
01:42:48,047 --> 01:42:49,727
Ein moment, Fräulein!

1350
01:42:52,115 --> 01:42:53,366
Holy mackerel!

1351
01:43:47,370 --> 01:43:49,936
The last time we had
one of these, it lasted 11 days.

1352
01:43:50,811 --> 01:43:52,240
You're a great comfort.

1353
01:43:52,656 --> 01:43:56,630
You can't get to Washington soon enough, can
you, to dash off that black Berlin report?

1354
01:43:57,599 --> 01:43:59,736
No report at all, Colonel Plummer.

1355
01:44:00,238 --> 01:44:03,324
- No?
- I came here as an objective observer.

1356
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:07,161
Some things have happened
which automatically disqualify me.

1357
01:44:07,892 --> 01:44:09,601
Aren't you taking it a little big?

1358
01:44:10,050 --> 01:44:12,979
- You know nothing whatever about it.
- I got a hunch.

1359
01:44:13,594 --> 01:44:16,681
In a way, I'm glad you took off the
blinkers and wandered away on your own.

1360
01:44:17,391 --> 01:44:20,478
It's a big mess we're trying to clean up.
There's a lot of rubble.

1361
01:44:21,187 --> 01:44:24,335
Rubble of all kinds,
vegetable, mineral and animal.

1362
01:44:25,461 --> 01:44:28,913
You walk around on it, you're apt to get
conked on the head by a loose brick.

1363
01:44:29,602 --> 01:44:31,739
Stop it, please.
I've had about all I can stand.

1364
01:44:32,250 --> 01:44:36,338
(Plummer) I'm sorry but I feel a little
responsible about that loose brick, Pringle.

1365
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:39,779
- Colonel, please.
- I'm not trying to whitewash him.

1366
01:44:40,497 --> 01:44:42,572
There isn't enough paint
in Germany for that

1367
01:44:43,074 --> 01:44:45,639
but let me scrape together
something in his defence.

1368
01:44:46,202 --> 01:44:48,182
- I'm not listening.
- Take it from me.

1369
01:44:48,674 --> 01:44:50,071
He won't get off scot-free.

1370
01:44:50,622 --> 01:44:52,625
As a matter of fact,
he's started to pay already.

1371
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:56,265
It's no fun to walk around
with a target pinned on your chest.

1372
01:45:00,811 --> 01:45:03,219
I'd appreciate it if you'd leave me alone.

1373
01:45:05,681 --> 01:45:08,027
How's about some reading matter
for the plane?

1374
01:45:09,340 --> 01:45:12,719
Those aren't teardrops. I was washing my
hands when he asked me to give it to you.

1375
01:45:16,118 --> 01:45:18,161
All right, I'll put it right there.

1376
01:45:29,548 --> 01:45:32,843
Colonel Plummer, it's clearing. We should
be taking off in about 20 minutes.

1377
01:45:33,938 --> 01:45:35,524
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

1378
01:45:45,450 --> 01:45:49,141
Gentlemen, I was just informed there will
be no flights until tomorrow morning.

1379
01:45:50,570 --> 01:45:52,656
Now, we might as well
get ourselves back into town.

1380
01:45:53,908 --> 01:45:57,599
Sorry, Miss Frost. We're going
to wait for the fog to lift a little.

1381
01:46:15,335 --> 01:46:18,693
<i>Amidst the ruins of Berlin</i>

1382
01:46:19,622 --> 01:46:23,136
<i>Trees are in bloom
as they have never been</i>

1383
01:46:23,896 --> 01:46:27,318
<i>Sometimes at night
you feel in all your sorrow</i>

1384
01:46:28,078 --> 01:46:31,373
<i>Her perfume as of a sweet tomorrow</i>

1385
01:46:32,113 --> 01:46:35,377
<i>That's when you realise at last</i>

1386
01:46:36,181 --> 01:46:39,570
<i>They won't return
the phantoms of the past</i>

1387
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:43,522
<i>A brand new spring is to begin</i>

1388
01:46:44,387 --> 01:46:47,316
<i>Out of the ruins of Berlin</i>

1389
01:46:53,199 --> 01:46:56,556
<i>Amidst the ruins of Berlin</i>

1390
01:46:57,505 --> 01:47:00,592
<i>Trees are in bloom
as they have never been...</i>

1391
01:47:29,548 --> 01:47:31,894
Hans Otto Birgel.

1392
01:48:08,767 --> 01:48:11,998
<i>Amidst the ruins of Berlin</i>

1393
01:48:13,355 --> 01:48:16,649
<i>Trees are in bloom
as they have never been</i>

1394
01:48:17,703 --> 01:48:21,216
<i>Sometimes at night
you feel in all your sorrow</i>

1395
01:48:22,270 --> 01:48:25,628
<i>Her perfume as of a sweet tomorrow</i>

1396
01:48:26,544 --> 01:48:29,872
<i>That's when you realise at last</i>

1397
01:48:30,861 --> 01:48:34,220
<i>They won't return

1398
01:48:35,211 --> 01:48:38,630
<i>A brand new spring is to begin</i>

1399
01:48:39,350 --> 01:48:42,186
<i>Out of the ruins of Berlin [Music:]</i>

1400
01:49:39,475 --> 01:49:42,833
So we followed her all day
until the five o'clock shadow showed.

1401
01:49:43,854 --> 01:49:46,389
- Sure enough, she was Hermann.
- Well, doggone.

1402
01:49:46,952 --> 01:49:48,724
You sure spin some tall tales.

1403
01:49:49,182 --> 01:49:51,716
Yeah, well, how about this?
Hans Otto Birgel.

1404
01:49:52,269 --> 01:49:54,281
Big Gestapo man hiding out underground.

1405
01:49:54,814 --> 01:49:58,014
The only lead we have is that he's still
crazy about a former lady friend,

1406
01:49:58,954 --> 01:50:02,280
a nightclub singer
somewhere in the American sector.

1407
01:50:03,343 --> 01:50:06,639
Herr Birgel suspects she's two-timing him
so he crawls out of his hole.

1408
01:50:07,305 --> 01:50:09,110
Only he doesn't crawl fast enough.

1409
01:50:09,568 --> 01:50:12,154
So we play it up a little
with the help of an American officer.

1410
01:50:12,666 --> 01:50:14,407
A captain, to be exact.

1411
01:50:14,856 --> 01:50:17,202
Make a fancy story in
a Sunday supplement someday.

1412
01:50:18,264 --> 01:50:19,882
- The Love Commando.
- Ha.

1413
01:50:21,707 --> 01:50:25,157
Here's their angle. The Captain
isn't very keen for the assignment,

1414
01:50:25,846 --> 01:50:28,160
having fallen for
somebody else in the meantime.

1415
01:50:29,255 --> 01:50:31,799
You know how they cook it up
with a lot of marshmallow on top.

1416
01:50:32,666 --> 01:50:35,324
Then the story of how
they got the poison into Göring's cell.

1417
01:50:35,909 --> 01:50:38,036
- (Whistles blowing)
- There were two scrub women...

1418
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:44,167
Sorry, sir. The car has to pull in.
Keeping the street open for the ambulance.

1419
01:50:44,844 --> 01:50:46,649
- What's up?
- Trouble at the Lorelei.

1420
01:50:47,628 --> 01:50:49,578
- Birgel showed up. There was shooting.
- (Plummer) Who got it?

1421
01:50:50,068 --> 01:50:52,384
- I don't know, sir.
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

1422
01:50:53,582 --> 01:50:55,626
Perhaps you'd want
to come along, Miss Frost.

1423
01:51:53,698 --> 01:51:55,471
Mm-hm. Two plugs right through the kisser.

1424
01:51:56,658 --> 01:51:57,911
No.

1425
01:51:59,411 --> 01:52:02,185
- It was an ugly kisser anyway.
- It was not.

1426
01:52:02,989 --> 01:52:05,824
He was no good
and he's dead and it's OK by me.

1427
01:52:07,753 --> 01:52:09,276
No sense of humour.

1428
01:52:09,745 --> 01:52:11,486
Take care of her, lover boy.

1429
01:52:20,944 --> 01:52:22,749
- All right, clean up the mess.
- Yes, sir.

1430
01:52:23,207 --> 01:52:26,262
Find him a slab before the Russkies
start tossing him up to the ceiling.

1431
01:52:31,977 --> 01:52:33,260
Go on home!

1432
01:52:33,717 --> 01:52:36,002
Come on, break it up, let's go. All right.

1433
01:52:40,392 --> 01:52:41,737
Where are you taking me?

1434
01:52:42,133 --> 01:52:45,095
Looks like you've got a date
with five million von bricks.

1435
01:52:46,138 --> 01:52:47,973
I have a paper saying
I'm on the white list.

1436
01:52:48,358 --> 01:52:50,182
We know how you got it and it wasn't,

1437
01:52:50,662 --> 01:52:53,196
if you'll pardon
the non-Aryan expression, kosher.

1438
01:52:53,759 --> 01:52:55,834
You do not understand. There's a mix-up.

1439
01:52:56,324 --> 01:52:58,463
Yeah. We just sent part of it
off to the morgue.

1440
01:52:58,973 --> 01:53:01,602
- Just ask Captain Pringle.
- Forget Captain Pringle.

1441
01:53:02,174 --> 01:53:04,970
How could I ever forget him?
He's so nice. I will miss him terribly.

1442
01:53:05,376 --> 01:53:07,149
- Please tell him.
- No soap.

1443
01:53:07,639 --> 01:53:10,693
And no chocolate, no cigarettes.

1444
01:53:11,392 --> 01:53:12,363
Tough.

1445
01:53:14,531 --> 01:53:18,472
Tell me, Colonel, are you
that wonderful Colonel Plummer?

1446
01:53:19,537 --> 01:53:22,737
That's me, only most of the
time they call me delicious.

1447
01:53:24,124 --> 01:53:26,847
Colonel, if I could come to your office
tomorrow sometime,

1448
01:53:28,056 --> 01:53:29,704
when you're not too busy.

1449
01:53:30,152 --> 01:53:33,300
Miss von Schlütow,
I've become a grandfather today.

1450
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:35,626
Let's not be silly.

1451
01:53:36,617 --> 01:53:38,265
She's all yours.

1452
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:41,016
Can they take me
by my apartment so I can change?

1453
01:53:41,528 --> 01:53:43,842
- I guess so.
- Come on, boys.

1454
01:53:46,607 --> 01:53:47,888
Has it stopped raining?

1455
01:53:48,722 --> 01:53:51,590
If there are any puddles,
you'll carry me, won't you, boys?

1456
01:54:02,436 --> 01:54:04,208
You two, watch out for those two.

1457
01:54:04,666 --> 01:54:05,981
Yes, sir.

1458
01:54:12,456 --> 01:54:15,115
- And you watch out for them.
- That ought to do it.

1459
01:54:25,710 --> 01:54:28,483
He said there were two
plugs in your kisser.

1460
01:54:29,087 --> 01:54:31,558
There ought to be.
I'm sorry about everything.

1461
01:54:32,215 --> 01:54:34,656
- Except the time with you.
- Take that away.

1462
01:54:35,208 --> 01:54:38,472
It's true. With all the headaches ahead,
you'll be my aspirin.

1463
01:54:39,140 --> 01:54:40,965
That's nice, but what about my headache?

1464
01:54:41,445 --> 01:54:43,123
You're on your way back home.

1465
01:54:43,562 --> 01:54:45,940
You'll be all right by the time
you fasten your seat belt.

1466
01:54:47,283 --> 01:54:48,775
I love you, John.

1467
01:54:51,080 --> 01:54:53,884
No, you don't. I'm just a hit-and-run boy.

1468
01:54:54,624 --> 01:54:56,909
The kind of guy you need
is somebody to marry.

1469
01:54:57,617 --> 01:54:58,806
Well?

1470
01:54:59,358 --> 01:55:02,081
Oh, no. I'm not somebody anybody marries.

1471
01:55:03,498 --> 01:55:08,044
You need somebody respectable,
a senator, a Supreme Court judge,

1472
01:55:09,452 --> 01:55:13,113
maybe... somebody from
the Smithsonian Institute.

1473
01:55:13,832 --> 01:55:14,958
I know who I want.

1474
01:55:15,324 --> 01:55:17,670
Not me, I'm a heel, a certified heel.

1475
01:55:18,211 --> 01:55:19,672
I got documents to prove it.

1476
01:55:21,069 --> 01:55:22,038
Listen...

1477
01:55:22,392 --> 01:55:26,366
"Listen, my children, and you shall hear
of the midnight ride of Paul Revere

1478
01:55:27,293 --> 01:55:30,444
"On the 18th of April in 1775
hardly a man is now alive

1479
01:55:31,089 --> 01:55:32,434
who remembers..."
