1
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,831
(Snoring)

2
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,075
Congressmen, we're now
flying over the heart of Berlin.

3
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,951
Berlin.

4
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,871
Over 75,000 tons of explosives
were dropped here.

5
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,071
British Lancasters by night,
American Fortresses by day.

6
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,908
I heard Russian artillery
had a little part in it too, if you don't mind.

7
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,350
Sure they did and I wish
they'd pay us for all those cannons.

8
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,188
Hey, quit juggling. Film like this
is good stuff around election time.

9
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,832
The incumbent overseas.

10
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,519
Pennecot, don't you want to see it?
Look at it.

11
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,031
Like pack rats been gnawing at a hunk
of old mouldy Roquefort cheese.

12
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,672
(Gags)

13
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,430
Miss Frost? Congresswoman Frost?

14
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,040
- Present.
- We're flying over Berlin.

15
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,835
15 minutes ahead of schedule.

16
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,235
Well, don't you want to see it?

17
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,271
One thing at a time.

18
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,148
You got quite a sight coming.
Looks like chicken innards at frying time.

19
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,760
Considering the taxpayers' money
poured on it,

20
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,189
I don't expect it to look like a lace Valentine.

21
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,077
Golly.

22
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,908
(Man) Well, that's rough doing.
That sure is rough doing.

23
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,869
(2nd man) They ought to put in grass
and move in a herd of longhorn.

24
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,356
Build up their industries.
Get those smokestacks belching again.

25
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,551
- Not without organised labour.
- We got to feed the people.

26
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,672
You can't keep a country
eating scraps out of garbage pails.

27
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,871
I'm all for sending food,
only let 'em know where it's from.

28
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,911
I object to dollar diplomacy.

29
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,111
- But you don't mind sending food.
- There's a difference.

30
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,720
If you give a hungry man bread,
that's democracy.

31
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,593
If you leave the wrapper on, it's imperialism.

32
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,235
Gentlemen, these are
very grave problems indeed

33
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,431
but they don't happen to be
the problems of this committee.

34
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,392
Perhaps I should remind you
why we were sent to Berlin,

35
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,238
since our chairman,
Mr Pennecot of New Hampshire,

36
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,398
has been indisposed ever since
we took off from Washington.

37
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,558
We're here to investigate the morale
of American occupation troops,

38
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,397
nothing else.

39
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,830
12,000 of our boys are policing
that pest hole down below

40
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:52,954
and according to reports, they are being
infected by a kind of moral malaria.

41
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,630
It is our duty to their wives, their mothers,
their sisters, to find the facts.

42
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,671
And if these reports are true,

43
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,838
to fumigate that place with
all the insecticides at our disposal.

44
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,759
If you'll pardon me,
we're approaching Tempelhof Airfield.

45
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,231
(Man) Oh, God, if they haven't got
a reception out for us.

46
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,077
(2nd man) A band and everything.

47
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,315
(3rd man) They'll be glad to see home folks.

48
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,755
Men, once more it is our honour and
privilege to welcome a visiting committee.

49
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,157
Lately they seem to be coming
as regularly as the electric bill.

50
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,555
This time it's not just VIPs.

51
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,319
This time we're getting VIPls.

52
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,079
Very lmportant Persons Indeed.

53
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,591
Some Congressional committee
to investigate our morale.

54
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:52,111
Seems back home, they've got an idea
this here is one great big picnic,

55
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,550
that all we do is swing in hammocks
with blonde Fruleins,

56
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,670
swap cigarettes for castles on the Rhine

57
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,280
and soak our feet in sparkling Mosel.

58
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,390
Well, let's not kid ourselves.

59
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,159
Some of you do go
overboard once in a while.

60
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,318
Maybe some of you are working too hard
to enlighten the civilian population

61
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,079
and maybe some of you
PX millionaires have found out

62
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,238
you can parlay a pack of cigarettes
into something more than 20 smokes.

63
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,192
After all, this isn't a Boy Scout camp.

64
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,037
We've got a tough job on our hands

65
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,231
and, by and large,
I think we're handling it darn well.

66
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,919
For my dough, we're on the ball.

67
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,679
Most of us, anyway... most of the time.

68
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:35,511
What they've got to realise is you can't pin
sergeant's stripes on an archangel.

69
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,472
Now, this committee
is going to be here for five days.

70
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,239
Let's give them as good
an impression as possible.

71
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,999
Not pussyfooting
around with a phoney attitude.

72
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,600
That's not fair to them or us.

73
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,552
I'm counting on you men to behave, period.

74
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,469
Morale. Maybe some day we can send
a little committee of our own

75
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,875
to investigate morale in Washington, DC.

76
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,638
Hey, look what I picked up
at the Brandenburg Gate.

77
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,235
- How much?
- A dozen candy bars.

78
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,275
They've still got some nine and a halfs.

79
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,675
- I got no one to give them to.
- How about Trudy?

80
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,315
I lost her. Russian sergeant came along
with a pound of rancid butter.

81
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,511
- Those German dames are all alike.
- Speak for yourself.

82
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,348
I wouldn't be afraid
of a Russian general with a ton of caviar.

83
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,077
Nice toe.

84
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,197
The best.

85
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,595
We're here, Congressman.
Ready to unload?

86
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,155
(J Upbeat march)

87
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,309
(Drill sergeant) Present... arms!

88
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,989
- Hello, Colonel.
- Nice to see you, General.

89
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,158
Mr Giffin from Texas, General Finney,
General McAndrew, Colonel Plummer.

90
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,395
- My pleasure.
- Mr Salvatore, from New York.

91
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,876
- The Bronx.
- Nobody's going to think you're Wall Street.

92
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,879
Mr Yandell, Congressman from Virginia.
Mr Kraus, Congressman from Illinois.

93
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,515
Hold it, everybody.
Want to get some of this brass.

94
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,357
Snappy little outfit you have.

95
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,595
Thank you. I have to apologise for the band.

96
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,632
- You should indeed.
- We're half strength today.

97
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,240
- We generally have 40 pieces.
- That's terrible.

98
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,193
We sent the others to the British sector
for a parade. It's Empire Day.

99
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,711
What's terrible is I came hoping to find
an army taking its task with seriousness.

100
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,115
Instead I find you have a 40-piece band.

101
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,515
Perhaps you also have
some drum majorettes.

102
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,073
- May I introduce...
- I know.

103
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,112
General Finney, General McAndrew
and Colonel Plummer.

104
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,948
It's in my data. I am Miss Frost,
Congresswoman from lowa, 9th district.

105
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,595
Delightful of Congress to send us
a lady representative for a change.

106
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,755
Delightful.

107
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,395
May I suggest here and now that
we dispense with all the soft soap.

108
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,591
As committee chairman,
permit me to bring you greetings

109
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,552
from the people
of the United States of America.

110
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,435
This genial reception augurs well
for the success of our mission.

111
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,076
I sincerely hope so. And now let us proceed
to a luncheon we have prepared for you.

112
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,750
A very simple luncheon. Powdered egg
omelette, probably, and a little Spam.

113
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,075
- Can I carry that for you?
- No, thank you.

114
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,715
I undertook to deliver it in person
to a Captain John Pringle,

115
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,115
stationed somewhere in Berlin, G2 Section.

116
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,152
- Could you tell me how to go about it?
- I could try.

117
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,510
Through army channels?
All I have is five days.

118
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,629
Captain Pringle!

119
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,837
Captain Pringle!

120
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,512
Captain Pringle reporting, sir.

121
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,279
Congresswoman Frost,
this is Captain Pringle.

122
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,710
Thank you. This is for you,
Captain Pringle. Happy birthday.

123
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,196
Or happy birthday yesterday.
I thought I could deliver it on time

124
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,391
but we were held up
in Newfoundland for 16 hours - fog.

125
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,796
- You brought this from America?
- Murdoch, lowa.

126
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,035
Well, how is good old lowa?

127
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,071
62%% % Republican, thank you.

128
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,511
I was entrusted with this by a constituent,
or rather, his daughter.

129
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,120
I hope it's still in one piece. Open it.

130
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,957
Be glad.

131
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,480
Well, what do you know? Little Dusty.

132
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,517
It's a beauty.

133
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,551
I didn't know it was so personal.

134
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,991
Her name is really Pauline Rose
but we call her Dusty. Some joke.

135
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,635
- How long since you've seen her?
- Dusty? Four years.

136
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,116
Don't these boys ever get home?
Can't they be given a short leave?

137
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,072
- Certainly, if it's accrued.
- I don't want any leave.

138
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,112
- You don't?
- Oh, of course I do. Dying to.

139
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,118
We're all homesick
but personal feelings don't matter.

140
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,151
There's unfinished business here.

141
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,351
Now that we've won the war,
we mustn't lose the peace.

142
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,949
I hate to think of anybody
sitting in his lonely barracks

143
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,797
with a birthday cake on his knees.

144
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,991
I won't have the cake on my knees.
I won't be alone.

145
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,355
There'll be my buddies. I'll call them in.

146
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,551
We'll open up a case of root beer,
light the candles,

147
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,716
then Frankovitch and his ukulele.

148
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,878
Some old songs.
Why, it'll be like back home... almost.

149
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,672
Good to hear you talk like that.

150
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,790
General Finney wants you to go in his car.

151
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,239
I'll be right with you.

152
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,831
If you're a sample of the spirit
prevailing in Berlin, I feel better already.

153
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,235
- I'm a sample, all right.
- Goodbye.

154
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,959
You're losing something, Captain Pringle.

155
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,472
My handkerchief.

156
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,875
You blow your nose in nylon nowadays?

157
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,955
What do you know? There must have
been a mistake at the laundry.

158
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,595
We got a crazy old laundress.
You know what happened to Frankovitch?

159
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,155
He sent out his shorts and got back a girdle.
(Laughs)

160
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,077
(Groans)

161
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,951
Ask her how much.

162
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,630
(Speaking German)

163
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,671
800 cigarettes, or coffee.

164
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,552
(Speaking German)

165
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,148
No. This watch gold. Gold for teeth.

166
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,395
- A watch from steel.
- How's this?

167
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,000
No, this silver. Want steel.

168
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,837
You want steel.

169
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,998
No, want round watch, very big, nice face.

170
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,828
You're tough. All right,
let's look in the other drawer.

171
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,235
(Cackles) Mickey Mouse! Mickey Mouse!

172
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,271
- How much?
- $700.

173
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,590
- You got three like this watch, maybe?
- We'll see.

174
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,838
Herr Captain, buy porcelain?
Little Cupid to take for wife?

175
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,872
Never mind the knick-knacks.
How much for the mattress?

176
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,718
- Why you want the mattress?
- I'm sleepy.

177
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,036
- How much for the mattress?
- (Speaking German)

178
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,155
What do you mean, "nein, nein, no"?

179
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,156
Look what you can get for it.

180
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,078
(Speaking German)

181
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,751
12 eggs in it and look at
the writing on it and the candles.

182
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,190
The candles alone are worth the mattress.
Get lost.

183
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,310
(All speaking German)

184
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,351
(Brakes squeal)

185
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,391
(Honks horn)

186
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,111
Yoo-hoo!

187
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,833
Erika! Erika!

188
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,231
(Whistling cheerfully)

189
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,556
(Speaks German)

190
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,240
Sit down, Johnny.

191
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,031
Go away, Johnny, sit down.

192
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,152
Johnny.

193
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,555
Johnny, what are you doing?

194
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,637
- I'm wiping my face.
- You're hurting me, Johnny.

195
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,831
You're always hurting me.
Why are you so mean to me?

196
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,077
I worry about you. I scrounge around,
I bring you presents

197
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,758
and you tell me I'm mean to you.

198
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,588
You brought me a present? Where is it?
Where have you got it?

199
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,676
Ohh...

200
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,838
Johnny, they're so sheer. So beautiful.

201
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,031
52 gauge. So I'm mean to you?

202
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,231
- No, you're good to me.
- You bet I am.

203
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,398
You don't know how good. I bought
you another present. You're not gonna get it.

204
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,591
Another one? Where have you got it?
Where is it, Johnny?

205
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,473
- Keep away.
- Is it here? Tell me...

206
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,992
Johnny... (Speaks German)

207
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,759
- Where did you get it?
- A friend of mine baked it.

208
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,588
Only you're not going to get it. Why
should I care whether you sleep or not?

209
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,519
Johnny, for 15 years
we haven't slept in Germany.

210
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,950
First it was Hitler screaming on the radio,
then the war of nerves,

211
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,195
then the victory celebrations,

212
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,231
then the bombing.

213
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,271
All the furniture burnt.

214
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,117
See?

215
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,116
(Springs crash and boing)

216
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,470
That one I hate worst.
Give me that mattress, Johnny.

217
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,511
No mattress will help you sleep.

218
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,949
What you Germans need
is a better conscience.

219
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,797
I have a good conscience.

220
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,991
I have a new Fhrer now... you.

221
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,314
Heil, Johnny.

222
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,999
You heil me once more
and I'll knock your teeth in.

223
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,837
You'll bruise your lips.

224
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,031
Why don't I choke you a little?
Break you in two?

225
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,559
Build a fire under you, you blonde witch.

226
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,033
(Knock at door)

227
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,672
Who's that?

228
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,711
With my luck, it's Eisenhower.

229
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,591
- Yes.
- Your name Schltow?

230
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,359
- I beg your pardon.
- Is your name Erika Schltow?

231
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,391
- No.
- You live here, don't you?

232
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,839
Yes, I live here.

233
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,678
You the dame that sings
at the Lorelei nightclub?

234
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,315
- Yes, I sing there.
- And your name's not Erika Schltow?

235
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,999
My name is Erika von Schltow.

236
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,031
- A von?
- She's a von.

237
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,878
Nobility. We beg your highness's pardon.

238
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,639
- What do you want?
- A little information.

239
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:25,515
It says here that a certain Erika Schltow...
von Schltow, pardon I...

240
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,711
has been an active von Nazi
ever since 19 - von - 35.

241
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,991
Go on, gentlemen.

242
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,271
It says that Miss von Schltow
was ordered over a month ago

243
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,039
to a von labour camp
to pick up some von bricks.

244
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,231
- What else does it say?
- You're working at a night joint.

245
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,795
According to this report,
what you're moving there ain't bricks.

246
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:49,675
I'm an artist, gentlemen, not a street
cleaner, and I've been completely cleared.

247
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,711
Yeah? Tell us all about it.

248
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,150
My case has been reviewed
and the decision reversed.

249
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,395
I'm on the white list now.

250
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,075
With that record? If you make the white list,
we'll make the hit parade.

251
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,714
- OK, von sister, get your things on.
- What for?

252
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,150
We're taking you to
the von denazification office.

253
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,919
Now, Abbot and Costello,
show me your orders.

254
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,757
- Yes, sir.
- Who gave you these?

255
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,791
- Lieutenant Clark, sir.
- Four weeks old.

256
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,637
We've had a lot of people to check.

257
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,070
Paperwork, that's why we're always
fouled up when a war starts.

258
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,510
Takes us six months to clear up
the paperwork from the last one.

259
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,358
I'll talk to Clark.
This case is straightened out.

260
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,039
- Sorry, sir.
- OK. That's all. Take off.

261
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,552
- May I have that, please?
- Sorry.

262
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,438
Take an ordinary guy, make him an MP,
suddenly he gets to be eight feet tall.

263
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,268
- If they look into the files for my papers.
- Stop worrying. They're OK.

264
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:57,108
- Goodbye. I got a desk full of work.
- Did the Colonel sign my papers?

265
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,948
Not exactly. He was out of the office
having his tonsils swabbed.

266
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,151
- The duty officer signed them.
- Who was the duty officer?

267
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,792
I was.

268
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,833
Johnny, if they find out you know me,
that's very dangerous.

269
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,871
Everything is dangerous.

270
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:16,391
I know an old lady back home,
broke her leg stepping into a church pew.

271
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,077
See you, baby.

272
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,911
Johnny! When you come back,
bring me some sugar.

273
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,757
- Yeah, sure.
- And some soap.

274
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,791
And hairpins.

275
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,628
- Anything else?
- A pillow to go with that mattress.

276
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,960
Ah, you gorgeous booby trap.

277
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,759
Yahoo!

278
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,991
(Siren wailing)

279
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,070
On your left is the Russian war memorial,

280
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,430
built in honour of their soldiers
killed in the battle of Berlin.

281
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,438
Those tanks on the side
were the first to enter Berlin.

282
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,955
Beyond it, the Reichstag,
the German house of representatives.

283
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,118
That's the building set on fire in 1933
and blamed on a poor Dutchman.

284
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,879
The word got out it was Hitler
who threw the match.

285
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,994
They used to say it's the first time in history
a man gave himself the hotfoot.

286
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,031
(Siren wailing)

287
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:18,155
The Brandenburg Gate, an arch of triumph
until they got out of the habit.

288
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,590
That rubble heap over there
was the American embassy.

289
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,791
You can't tell now but this spot
was once the heart of Europe.

290
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,035
The street is the famous Unter den Linden,

291
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,675
named after the linden trees,
which they've replanted now.

292
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,359
That pile of stone over there
was the Adlon Hotel,

293
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,995
just after the 8th Air Force
checked in for the weekend.

294
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,600
Now, let's look at the Wilhelmstrae.

295
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,153
(Siren wailing)

296
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,034
Here's the Reich Chancellery where
the Fhrer fixed himself up a duplex.

297
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,198
As it turned out, one part got to be a big
padded cell and the other a mortuary.

298
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,231
Underneath is a concrete basement,

299
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,716
where he married Eva Braun
and where they killed themselves.

300
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,752
A lot of people say it was
the perfect honeymoon.

301
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,915
Over there is the balcony where he bet
his Reich would last a thousand years.

302
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,111
That's the one that broke
the bookies' hearts.

303
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,678
This is the Tiergarten,
used to be the Central Park of Berlin.

304
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,191
Those two big cement things are
the zoo bunkers, enormous pillboxes.

305
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,391
They were the last two buildings
in Berlin to surrender.

306
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,355
I thought you'd be interested
in a typical Berlin residential area.

307
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,551
If you look hard,
you'll see the houses are empty shells,

308
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,558
completely burned out by incendiaries.

309
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,239
Life goes on in those ruins, though.

310
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,032
That used to be
the largest department store in Berlin.

311
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:20,154
It was 12 storeys high. Later on it became
headquarters for the storm troopers.

312
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:25,274
They blew it up themselves.
The idea was to destroy all their records.

313
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,791
They overlooked the fact that most
of them were in fireproof vaults.

314
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,597
Excuse me.

315
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,678
Well.

316
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,348
This is one of our youth clubs. We've
got a lot of them in the American zone.

317
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,518
We had quite a problem. Those weren't
ordinary youngsters when we came in.

318
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:11,758
They were mean old men. Now we're
trying to make kids of them again.

319
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,395
We had to kick the goose step out of them
and cure them of blind obedience

320
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,510
and teach them to beep at the referee.

321
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,199
If they want to steal,
make sure it's second base.

322
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,954
(Cheering)

323
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,788
One thing they don't have to worry about
round here, breaking windows.

324
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,150
One family has already
christened a kid DiMaggio Schultz.

325
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,760
That's when I started believing
we'd won the war.

326
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,952
- (Shouts in German)
- (All yelling)

327
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,838
(Man) Hey, Frulein! Hey, Frulein!

328
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,235
(Whistling)

329
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,078
Hey, Frulein! Hey, Frulein!

330
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,549
(Laughing) No, no, no.

331
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,798
Come on. What's the matter with you two?
Just a little Spazierfahren in the park.

332
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,515
Nein, we don't bicycle. We automobile.
(Both laugh)

333
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,600
Automobile? You got yourselves officers?

334
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,030
- (Speaking German)
- French officers.

335
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,675
OK. So they got an automobile
but we got the candy bar.

336
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,711
(Speaking German)

337
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,154
Ah, your Fhrer's moustache.

338
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,072
Hey, Doctor, I got a lady on the balcony.

339
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,912
Size 14.

340
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,315
Hey, Frulein! Hey, Frulein!

341
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:50,751
Hey, Frulein! Stop, Frulein!

342
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,639
- Guten afternoon, Frulein.
- Hello, Frulein.

343
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,477
(Giggles)

344
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,478
Das is my friend Brigadier General Mike.

345
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,715
And das is mein Freund,
Lieutenant General Joe.

346
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,034
Jawohl.

347
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,435
You know, you're a nice little strudel.

348
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,675
Hey, hands off. I saw her first.

349
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,755
(Giggles)

350
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,519
Frulein, would you like
a little Spamachen,

351
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:16,269
- Biertrinken and Tanzen making?
- Jawohl.

352
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,710
She must be tetched in the wool.
All she can say is, "Jawohl".

353
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,797
(All laugh)

354
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,958
J Frulein, Frulein, willst du ein candy bar

355
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,118
J Schn, fein Frulein,

356
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,151
J At home though you won't believe us

357
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,191
J The girls could take or leave us

358
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:40,075
J But here we squares is millionaires,
ach, du wunderbar candy bar J

359
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,112
Don't give her that candy bar yet.
Are you crazy?

360
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,948
- I ain't giving. I'm just showing.
- Say, was ist your name?

361
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,117
(Speaking German)

362
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,355
- Er, Gretchen.
- Gretchen what?

363
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,469
(Giggles)

364
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,671
- Gesundheit. Gretchen Gesundheit.
- Gesundheit!

365
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,871
How do you like that?
We're fraternising with a sneeze.

366
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,071
J Gretchen, Gretchen... J

367

with percussion)

369
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,158
- I'm sorry. It's five packs now.
- Four packs.

370
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,590
Five packs for champagne,
three for wine, one for beer.

371
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,553
This is eine kleine clip joint. Here's your tip.

372
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,593
How do you like these prices? We got
to write Congress to boost our PX ration.

373
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:06,111
Fat chance. All them schmoes think about
is coal strikes, flood control, United Nations.

374
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,755
What's Congress? A bunch of salesmen
with their foot in the right door.

375
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,633
For my dough, you can have
Congress and the Senate.

376
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,636
- I'll take it.
- You got it.

377
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,433
(Speaking German)

378

What a bunch of cut-ups.

381
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,513
Hey, Gretchen, you live with your mother?
(Speaking German)

382
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,357
What business is it of yours?

383
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,755
Look, what do you want, the whole family?

384
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,872
You pulling a trick like the one
with the Schultz sisters?

385
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,275
Nein, nein, you Soldaten, United States.

386
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,311

463
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,033
- What kind of language...
- I said ape and I meant ape.

464
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,832
Hey! Hey!

465
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,674
- Where did you get that cake?
- (Joe) Hey, Mike.

466
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,711
I demand to know where you got that cake.

467
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,751
(Man) What you want?

468
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,951
Where'd this restaurant get food?
Our business, not yours.

469
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,399
I'm making it my business.

470
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,431
I happen to know all about that cake

471
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,631
and I am a Congresswoman
of the United States of America.

472
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,959
- Some strudel you picked.
- Yeah, let's go.

473
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,315
Put back that slice of the cake.

474
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,158
Take out the knife.
I want to know what it is doing here.

475
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,395
- It is being eaten.
- That's enough.

476
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,431
- This cake is confiscated.
- Hello.

477
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,870
- How do you do? So that's where it is.
- What do you know about this?

478
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,036
Very little. It was stolen out of my Jeep.

479
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,992
- It was?
- Stolen and sold on the black market.

480
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,600
They'll steal anything around here.

481
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,235
- When I think of that girl back in lowa...
- Yeah.

482
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,840
I'll take care of this. Don't trouble yourself.

483
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,998
Thank you. Will you also take care
of a pair of disgusting soldiers

484
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,759
who should be stood up against a wall and...

485
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,159
Oh.

486
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,273
I want you to find them.
They're medium height. One is a little taller.

487
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:29,438
Their names are Mike and Joe and
they're in uniforms with US on the collar.

488
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,754
Perfect sense, ma'am.

489
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,314
Now, what exactly is
the name of this sewer?

490
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,918
- The Lorelei.
- Address?

491
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,475
- Number 15, Hagenbachstrae.
- Are there other sewers like this?

492
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,035
- Three or four but this is the best.
- What is the name of that woman?

493
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,798
- What woman?
- The singer here.

494
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,877
Oh, the singer. I think it's Erika.

495
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,310
- Erika what?
- Erika von Schltow.

496
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,759
Why do you ask about her?

497
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:56,271
Because there's something funny going on
here and I'm not in the mood for laughs.

498
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,515
Schltow? How do you spell it?

499
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,551
Schltow, with an umlaut.

500
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,591
I thought so.

501
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,678
I want you to remember
that when we moved into Germany,

502
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,632
we found a country of
open graves and closed hearts.

503
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,478
We've tried to turn it into a civilised state.

504
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:18,115
We had to eliminate things
that breed unrest and aggression.

505
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,311
We've tried to make them free men
and give them some dignity.

506
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:25,148
We had to return four million
displaced persons to their homes.

507
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,839
That's hard if you don't have
a home to start with.

508
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,917
We had to repair hospitals
and public utilities.

509
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,350
I remember the first day the gasworks
started operating again.

510
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,790
There were 160 suicides in Berlin alone.

511
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,637
That was ten months ago.

512
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,798
Today, they take a match and light
the gas and boil some potatoes.

513
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:47,435
Not many potatoes, mind you.
There is still a lot of hunger.

514
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,596
But there is a new will to live.

515
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:54,111
We had to build schools and find teachers
and then teach the teachers.

516
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,278
We helped them start a free press
and institute a parliamentary government.

517
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,880
They had their first free election in 14 years.

518
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,354
It had been so long
they didn't know what to do.

519
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,551
It was like handing
the village drunk a glass of water.

520
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:12,031
What I want to point out is that
it's a tough, thankless, lonely job.

521
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,275
We're trying to lick it as well as we can.

522
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,710
You might as well know,
some of us get out of line occasionally.

523
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,320
But remember this.
For the first time in history,

524
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:24,990
you are asking the same generation of
soldiers to be both valorous and wise.

525
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,837
- Mighty fine.
- Well said.

526
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,475
I sure hope our chairman has
made notes of that speech of yours.

527
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,159
I think it should be
incorporated in our report.

528
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,351
Colonel, we buy every word of it, all of us.

529
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,913
I don't.

530
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,317
I wouldn't think of buying it. I'm surprised
at my colleagues' low sales resistance.

531
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,750
Miss Frost, this attitude calls
for some explanation.

532
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,995
Colonel Plummer, in your eloquent speech,

533
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,235
which I'm sure you've made 50 times,

534
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,068
you used the phrase "Some of our boys
may get out of line sometimes."

535
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,315
That is a masterpiece of understatement.

536
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,873
What are you driving at?

537
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,550
In your effort to civilise this country,
our boys are becoming barbarians.

538
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,751
- I explained on that tour...
- I know all about those tours.

539
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,191
You put blinkers on us and make sure
we only see what you want us to see.

540
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,835
Then you give us pamphlets,
statistics, a rousing speech

541
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,872
and ship us back a little more
bamboozled than when we came.

542
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,639
We could have learned
as much from Reader's Digest.

543
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:24,070
- This is very embarrassing, Colonel.
- Go on, Miss Frost.

544
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,953
Well, I don't like blinkers.
I look in all directions

545
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,437
and when I suspect dirt's been swept
under a carpet, I turn up that carpet.

546
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,631
- What carpet? What dirt?
- What dirt?

547
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:38,912
- One day and this is filled with it.
- Please particularise.

548
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,679
Gls consorting with German Fruleins...

549
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,153
Fraternisation is legal.

550
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,875
...in wide-open, shameless,
black-market nightclubs.

551
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,668
So we close them and our boys sneak off
to places in the Russian sector,

552
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,757
or the British, or in the French,
and there's another thing.

553
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,837
This is off the record.
Those places attract a lot of scum

554
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,475
and we clean it up by cracking down
with a surprise raid once in a while.

555
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,638
Notorious Nazi entertainers parading
themselves before our boys,

556
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,592
- is that off the record too?
- For instance?

557
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:13,031
I am specifically referring
to one Erika von Schltow,

558
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:18,074
who works at a dive called the Lorelei,
15 Hagenbachstrae.

559
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,678
How can a creature...

560
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,440
I insist on a satisfactory explanation.

561
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,268
I must ask the Congresswoman
to drop this particular matter.

562
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,517
- Why?
- Some things must be left to our discretion.

563
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,031
Colonel Plummer, I didn't go for
the blinkers. Now, don't try a muzzle.

564
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:42,470
The last time someone wanted to gag me,
he tried it with a mink coat

565
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:48,072
but I never let go until the president of that
particular ship company wound up in jail,

566
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,112
even though I did get
pneumonia that winter.

567
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,632
Herr Maier, this is the second time
we've had complaints.

568
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,956
I don't think it's a good idea
that your son... What's his name?

569
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,035
Gerhard.

570
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:05,551
That Gerhard should draw swastikas
all over the neighbourhood.

571
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,909
(Chastises in German)

572
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,236
- I will break his arm.
- We've dissolved the Gestapo.

573
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,751
No food, Brschchen.
I will lock him into a dark room.

574
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,791
Why not just shove him in a gas chamber?

575
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,875
Yes, Herr Kapitn.

576
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,639
Listen, we've done away
with concentration camps.

577
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,036
Take him round to a G YA,
one of our German youth clubs.

578
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:28,675
Some baseball and a little less
heel-clicking is what he needs.

579
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,915
Here's the address. Ask for Sergeant Breen.

580
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,757
Yes, Herr Kapitn.

581
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,358
I mean, thank you, Herr Kapitn.

582
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,277
Auf wiedersehen.

583
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,311
Come, Brschchen.

584
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,112
- Captain Pringle is wanted in 112.
- Who's that?

585
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,720
That Congress dame,
whatever her name is.

586
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,352
- Wants to see me?
- You, sir.

587
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,595
- Now?
- Now. She's clucking like a hen.

588
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,757
You'd better get there
before she lays an egg.

589
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,200
- Captain Pringle reporting.
- Hello.

590
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,197
- Lorelei, how do you spell it?
- Lorelei?

591
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,231
L-E or E-I at the end?

592
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,872
E-I.

593
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,717
Thank you.

594
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:34,278
Captain Pringle, my belief in the army
has been shaken to the core.

595
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,517
- Really?
- I can't trust anybody in uniform.

596
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,118
Now, please...

597
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,720
With one single exception, you.

598
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,795
Thank you, ma'am.

599
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,035
I trust you because we're both lowans.

600
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:49,675
- Right back at you, Miss Frost.
- Moreover, you're a hard worker.

601
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,075
Perhaps you work too hard. You look tired.

602
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,315
Well, I hoped it didn't show.

603
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,315
That is ink, Captain Pringle.

604
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,588
So it is.

605
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,119
Captain, I need your help.

606
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,994
I want some additional data
on Frulein von Schltow.

607
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,473
The one with the umlaut.

608
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:10,149
- Oh, her.
- There must be a file on that woman.

609
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,795
- Of course there is. Only it's not here.
- It isn't?

610
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,479
I asked for it
and I was told it's gone to Nrnberg.

611
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,671
On account of the trials,
a lot of files have been sent there.

612
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,517
- I see.
- I asked around, though.

613
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,393
- Did you find anything?
- Nothing important. Gossip.

614
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,079
Are you sure? No fire with all that smoke?

615
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:30,032
She may have known
a couple of minor party members.

616
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,878
Nothing worth your attention.
Small fry, I'd say.

617
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,559
- All right, ma'am, we're ready to go.
- Thank you.

618
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,592
A warrant officer said he'd seen her
in an old newsreel,

619
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,200
so I sent for the film from the Signal Corp.

620
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,197
(Pringle) The Week In Pictures.

621
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,191
This is a little Nazi get-together in Breslau.

622
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:02,308
That's Goebbels telling them
how they're winning the war.

623
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,912
Opening of the opera with Lohengrin
and famous guests.

624
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,349
(Frost) They fiddled big while Berlin burned.

625
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,073
Lohengrin, you know, swan song.

626
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:23,236
(Frost) Now we're getting someplace.
I wonder what holds up that dress.

627
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,794
(Pringle) Must be that German willpower.

628
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,274
(Frost) Who's that man?
(Pringle) I think it's Birgel.

629
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,788
(Frost) Who?
(Pringle) Hans Otto Birgel.

630
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,831
(Frost) Who is Hans Otto Birgel?

631
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,316
(Pringle) He had something to do
with the Gestapo. He's dead.

632
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:42,037
- Killed himself when the Russians came.
- (Frost) An important party member?

633
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,877
(Pringle) So-so.

634
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,878
(Frost) Well, she must be his girlfriend.

635
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,559
Maybe she doesn't know him.
Maybe she had a dizzy spell

636
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,478
and the first thing she could catch
was his... elbow.

637
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,115
(Frost) That's enough. Thank you.

638
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:26,273
Well, we've learned one thing.
No small fry is she.

639
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,357
- I guess not.
- That a Nazi woman like that should...

640
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,551
I'll see she discontinues
her appearances as an entertainer.

641
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,795
- Will that be satisfactory?
- It will not.

642
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,400
What would you suggest, shave her head?

643
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,032
- I'm not after her head.
- Well?

644
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:42,675
It's common talk that an officer
in the army is protecting her.

645
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,110
- It's his head I'm after.
- You really think an officer?

646
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,957
Incredible as it may seem.

647
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,195
Now, let's use some common sense.

648
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,835
That man is not giving her
his protection for platonic reasons.

649
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,871
- Granted?
- Granted.

650
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,275
Of course the association is undercover.

651
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:01,232
He's not stupid enough
to entertain her at his billet.

652
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:05,068
- I guess that's right.
- We can therefore assume he visits her.

653
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,111
Very logical.

654
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:10,550
Therefore, to catch him,
we must watch her place.

655
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,397
Smart idea.

656
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,159
- You know where she lives?
- I can find out.

657
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,351
And I shall watch it
day and night... personally.

658
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,960
No, we'll watch it together, the two of us.

659
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,390
- We will?
- Yes. I want to be an eyewitness.

660
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:27,876
I want to see that man myself
and face him down.

661
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,275
Can you afford the time, Miss Frost?

662
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:33,915
Any time it requires.
This I intend to make my case in point.

663
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,757
You'll go to the General?

664
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,793
I will, and to the War Department
and to the President.

665
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,791
And if that doesn't do it,
I'll see Gabriel Heater.

666
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:59,030
It's well after curfew.
I wonder if he's coming tonight.

667
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,799
- He'll be here.
- Yeah?

668
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:05,116
I don't think you understand
about arrangements like this.

669
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,720
They work 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.

670
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,751
Does the CIO know about this?

671
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:16,071
Are you sure there aren't
any back stairs to that apartment?

672
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,712
There isn't even any back wall.

673
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,752
She must be waiting for somebody.
Why leave the lights on?

674
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,872
Maybe she's knitting
or putting up pickled peaches.

675
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,471
Only we know better.

676
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,036
Pickled peaches.

677
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,749
I bet you miss lowa. I do already.

678
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,351
- It's changed since you've been there.
- Yeah?

679
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,278
A lot has happened, especially in Murdoch.

680
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,039
- Do you remember Union Street?
- Mm-hm.

681
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:52,551
Well, they've changed the name.
Now it's called lwo Jima Boulevard.

682
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,751
- That's news.
- And there was a post office scandal.

683
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,395
- Yeah?
- About the new mural in the post office.

684
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,000
The town collected $2,000 to hire a painter.

685
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,191
The mayor got his cousin
from Chicago to do it.

686
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,435
- That's nice.
- It was 80 feet long.

687
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,357
Supposed to be Custer's last stand.

688
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,995
After the cousin left town,
they found out it wasn't an original.

689
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,679
He copied the whole thing from a beer ad.

690
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,153
(Pringle) Hm.

691
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:21,557
- There was an awful lot of trouble.
- You take lowa seriously, don't you?

692
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,955
Yes, I guess I do. I like it. Don't you?

693
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,433
Mm-hm.

694
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:28,870
We won a lot of honours last year,
all the 4H prizes.

695
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,512
It's getting a little chilly.

696
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:33,950
We had the lowest juvenile delinquency rate
until two months ago.

697
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,069
What happened?

698
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:38,271
A boy in Des Moines took
a blowtorch to his grandmother.

699
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:41,471
We fell clear down to 16th place.
It was humiliating.

700
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,431
(Horn honks)

701
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,671
(Key clinks)

702
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,312
What's that?

703
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:57,079
- Crickets.
- Something dropped.

704
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,680
- How's that?
- Something metallic.

705
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,517
Metallic?

706
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,717
Look, it's a key.

707
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,955
A key? Whatever for?

708
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,151
Evidently the man honks the horn
and that's the signal.

709
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,555
You know more about
these things than I do.

710
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,591
(Erika) Johnny? Johnny?

711
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,351
Where are you, Johnny?

712
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,593
Johnny?

713
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:34,391
- Johnny.
- There are a lot of Johnnys in the army.

714
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,635
- Now we're getting someplace.
- Where?

715
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:39,831
This eliminates all the Jims,
the Bobs and the Georges.

716
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,871
Too bad his name isn't Zachary.

717
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,911
Yes, that would simplify it.

718
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,996
(Door opening)

719
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,759
Johnny.

720
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:05,552
I... don't know who you refer to.

721
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,192
I am Captain Pringle

722
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:11,358
and I have with me a member
of the Congress of the United States.

723
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,197
Good evening.

724
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,038
- You are Erika von Schltow?
- I am.

725
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:20,709
We have reason to believe you're
consorting with a member of our army.

726
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:24,230
- You have?
- We think you're expecting him now.
