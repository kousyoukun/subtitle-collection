1
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:56,917
(Snoring)

2
00:01:58,627 --> 00:02:02,380
Congressmen, we're now
flying over the heart of Berlin.

3
00:02:03,298 --> 00:02:05,383
Berlin.

4
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:10,514
Over 75,000 tons of explosives
were dropped here.

5
00:02:10,555 --> 00:02:13,850
British Lancasters by night,
American Fortresses by day.

6
00:02:13,892 --> 00:02:17,854
I heard Russian artillery
had a little part in it too, if you don't mind.

7
00:02:17,896 --> 00:02:21,441
Sure they did and I wish
they'd pay us for all those cannons.

8
00:02:21,483 --> 00:02:25,445
Hey, quit juggling. Film like this
is good stuff around election time.

9
00:02:25,487 --> 00:02:27,155
The incumbent overseas.

10
00:02:27,197 --> 00:02:29,950
Pennecot, don't you want to see it?
Look at it.

11
00:02:29,991 --> 00:02:34,663
Like pack rats been gnawing at a hunk
of old mouldy Roquefort cheese.

12
00:02:34,704 --> 00:02:36,373
(Gags)

13
00:02:41,002 --> 00:02:44,464
Miss Frost? Congresswoman Frost?

14
00:02:44,506 --> 00:02:47,175
- Present.
- We're flying over Berlin.

15
00:02:49,886 --> 00:02:52,180
15 minutes ahead of schedule.

16
00:02:52,222 --> 00:02:54,683
Well, don't you want to see it?

17
00:02:54,724 --> 00:02:56,810
One thing at a time.

18
00:03:35,474 --> 00:03:39,436
You got quite a sight coming.
Looks like chicken innards at frying time.

19
00:03:39,478 --> 00:03:42,147
Considering the taxpayers' money
poured on it,

20
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:44,691
I don't expect it to look like a lace Valentine.

21
00:03:48,945 --> 00:03:50,822
Golly.

22
00:03:56,077 --> 00:04:00,040
(Man) Well, that's rough doing.
That sure is rough doing.

23
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:08,340
(2nd man) They ought to put in grass
and move in a herd of longhorn.

24
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:11,968
Build up their industries.
Get those smokestacks belching again.

25
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,305
- Not without organised labour.
- We got to feed the people.

26
00:04:15,347 --> 00:04:18,558
You can't keep a country
eating scraps out of garbage pails.

27
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,895
I'm all for sending food,
only let 'em know where it's from.

28
00:04:21,937 --> 00:04:24,022
I object to dollar diplomacy.

29
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:27,359
- But you don't mind sending food.
- There's a difference.

30
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,070
If you give a hungry man bread,
that's democracy.

31
00:04:30,111 --> 00:04:33,073
If you leave the wrapper on, it's imperialism.

32
00:04:33,114 --> 00:04:36,868
Gentlemen, these are
very grave problems indeed

33
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,205
but they don't happen to be
the problems of this committee.

34
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:43,291
Perhaps I should remind you
why we were sent to Berlin,

35
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:46,253
since our chairman,
Mr Pennecot of New Hampshire,

36
00:04:46,294 --> 00:04:50,590
has been indisposed ever since
we took off from Washington.

37
00:04:50,632 --> 00:04:54,928
We're here to investigate the morale
of American occupation troops,

38
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,847
nothing else.

39
00:04:56,888 --> 00:05:00,433
12,000 of our boys are policing
that pest hole down below

40
00:05:00,475 --> 00:05:05,772
and according to reports, they are being
infected by a kind of moral malaria.

41
00:05:05,814 --> 00:05:10,652
It is our duty to their wives, their mothers,
their sisters, to find the facts.

42
00:05:10,694 --> 00:05:12,779
And if these reports are true,

43
00:05:12,821 --> 00:05:17,117
to fumigate that place with
all the insecticides at our disposal.

44
00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:21,204
If you'll pardon me,
we're approaching Tempelhof Airfield.

45
00:05:22,581 --> 00:05:25,876
(Man) Oh, God, if they haven't got
a reception out for us.

46
00:05:25,917 --> 00:05:27,794
(2nd man) A band and everything.

47
00:05:27,836 --> 00:05:30,130
(3rd man) They'll be glad to see home folks.

48
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:45,187
Men, once more it is our honour and
privilege to welcome a visiting committee.

49
00:05:45,228 --> 00:05:49,774
Lately they seem to be coming
as regularly as the electric bill.

50
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,277
This time it's not just VIPs.

51
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:55,155
This time we're getting VIPIs.

52
00:05:55,197 --> 00:05:58,033
Very Important Persons Indeed.

53
00:05:58,074 --> 00:06:02,746
Some Congressional committee
to investigate our morale.

54
00:06:02,787 --> 00:06:07,459
Seems back home, they've got an idea
this here is one great big picnic,

55
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:11,046
that all we do is swing in hammocks
with blonde Fräuleins,

56
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:13,256
swap cigarettes for castles on the Rhine

57
00:06:13,298 --> 00:06:15,967
and soak our feet in sparkling Mosel.

58
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,178
Well, let's not kid ourselves.

59
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,056
Some of you do go
overboard once in a while.

60
00:06:21,097 --> 00:06:25,393
Maybe some of you are working too hard
to enlighten the civilian population

61
00:06:25,435 --> 00:06:28,271
and maybe some of you
PX millionaires have found out

62
00:06:28,313 --> 00:06:32,609
you can parlay a pack of cigarettes
into something more than 20 smokes.

63
00:06:32,651 --> 00:06:35,695
After all, this isn't a Boy Scout camp.

64
00:06:35,737 --> 00:06:37,614
We've got a tough job on our hands

65
00:06:37,656 --> 00:06:40,951
and, by and large,
I think we're handling it darn well.

66
00:06:40,992 --> 00:06:43,745
For my dough, we're on the ball.

67
00:06:43,787 --> 00:06:46,623
Most of us, anyway... most of the time.

68
00:06:46,665 --> 00:06:52,712
What they've got to realise is you can't pin
sergeant's stripes on an archangel.

69
00:06:52,754 --> 00:06:55,799
Now, this committee
is going to be here for five days.

70
00:06:55,841 --> 00:06:58,677
Let's give them as good
an impression as possible.

71
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:01,555
Not pussyfooting
around with a phoney attitude.

72
00:07:01,596 --> 00:07:04,266
That's not fair to them or us.

73
00:07:04,307 --> 00:07:07,352
I'm counting on you men to behave, period.

74
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:12,482
Morale. Maybe some day we can send
a little committee of our own

75
00:07:12,524 --> 00:07:14,985
to investigate morale in Washington, DC.

76
00:07:19,823 --> 00:07:24,119
Hey, look what I picked up
at the Brandenburg Gate.

77
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:27,873
- How much?
- A dozen candy bars.

78
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:31,042
They've still got some nine and a halfs.

79
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:33,545
- I got no one to give them to.
- How about Trudy?

80
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:37,340
I lost her. Russian sergeant came along
with a pound of rancid butter.

81
00:07:37,382 --> 00:07:40,677
- Those German dames are all alike.
- Speak for yourself.

82
00:07:40,719 --> 00:07:44,681
I wouldn't be afraid
of a Russian general with a ton of caviar.

83
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,517
Nice toe.

84
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,813
The best.

85
00:08:01,406 --> 00:08:03,700
We're here, Congressman.
Ready to unload?

86
00:08:06,161 --> 00:08:08,455
([Music:] Upbeat march)

87
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:16,963
(Drill sergeant) Present... arms!

88
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,484
- Hello, Colonel.
- Nice to see you, General.

89
00:08:37,526 --> 00:08:41,822
Mr Giffin from Texas, General Finney,
General McAndrew, Colonel Plummer.

90
00:08:41,863 --> 00:08:44,157
- My pleasure.
- Mr Salvatore, from New York.

91
00:08:44,199 --> 00:08:47,786
- The Bronx.
- Nobody's going to think you're Wall Street.

92
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:51,957
Mr Yandell, Congressman from Virginia.
Mr Kraus, Congressman from Illinois.

93
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:55,752
Hold it, everybody.
Want to get some of this brass.

94
00:08:55,794 --> 00:08:57,671
Snappy little outfit you have.

95
00:08:57,712 --> 00:09:00,006
Thank you. I have to apologise for the band.

96
00:09:00,048 --> 00:09:03,176
- You should indeed.
- We're half strength today.

97
00:09:03,218 --> 00:09:05,887
- We generally have 40 pieces.
- That's terrible.

98
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:10,016
We sent the others to the British sector
for a parade. It's Empire Day.

99
00:09:10,058 --> 00:09:14,729
What's terrible is I came hoping to find
an army taking its task with seriousness.

100
00:09:14,771 --> 00:09:17,232
Instead I find you have a 40-piece band.

101
00:09:17,274 --> 00:09:19,734
Perhaps you also have
some drum majorettes.

102
00:09:19,776 --> 00:09:21,361
- May I introduce...
- I know.

103
00:09:21,403 --> 00:09:24,531
General Finney, General McAndrew
and Colonel Plummer.

104
00:09:24,573 --> 00:09:28,535
It's in my data. I am Miss Frost,
Congresswoman from Iowa, 9th district.

105
00:09:28,577 --> 00:09:32,330
Delightful of Congress to send us
a lady representative for a change.

106
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:33,540
Delightful.

107
00:09:33,582 --> 00:09:37,335
May I suggest here and now that
we dispense with all the soft soap.

108
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:40,672
As committee chairman,
permit me to bring you greetings

109
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:43,758
from the people
of the United States of America.

110
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,847
This genial reception augurs well
for the success of our mission.

111
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:53,685
I sincerely hope so. And now let us proceed
to a luncheon we have prepared for you.

112
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:58,565
A very simple luncheon. Powdered egg
omelette, probably, and a little Spam.

113
00:10:05,822 --> 00:10:08,283
- Can I carry that for you?
- No, thank you.

114
00:10:08,325 --> 00:10:12,078
I undertook to deliver it in person
to a Captain John Pringle,

115
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,581
stationed somewhere in Berlin, G2 Section.

116
00:10:14,623 --> 00:10:17,751
- Could you tell me how to go about it?
- I could try.

117
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:21,254
Through army channels?
All I have is five days.

118
00:10:21,296 --> 00:10:22,422
Captain Pringle!

119
00:10:23,882 --> 00:10:25,759
Captain Pringle!

120
00:10:29,846 --> 00:10:31,681
Captain Pringle reporting, sir.

121
00:10:31,723 --> 00:10:34,559
Congresswoman Frost,
this is Captain Pringle.

122
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:38,146
Thank you. This is for you,
Captain Pringle. Happy birthday.

123
00:10:38,188 --> 00:10:41,775
Or happy birthday yesterday.
I thought I could deliver it on time

124
00:10:41,817 --> 00:10:45,111
but we were held up
in Newfoundland for 16 hours - fog.

125
00:10:45,153 --> 00:10:48,657
- You brought this from America?
- Murdoch, Iowa.

126
00:10:48,698 --> 00:10:50,992
Well, how is good old Iowa?

127
00:10:51,034 --> 00:10:53,119
62°% Republican, thank you.

128
00:10:53,161 --> 00:10:57,749
I was entrusted with this by a constituent,
or rather, his daughter.

129
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,460
I hope it's still in one piece. Open it.

130
00:11:00,502 --> 00:11:02,379
Be glad.

131
00:11:11,721 --> 00:11:14,391
Well, what do you know? Little Dusty.

132
00:11:16,726 --> 00:11:18,603
It's a beauty.

133
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,730
I didn't know it was so personal.

134
00:11:20,772 --> 00:11:25,360
Her name is really Pauline Rose
but we call her Dusty. Some joke.

135
00:11:25,402 --> 00:11:29,156
- How long since you've seen her?
- Dusty? Four years.

136
00:11:29,197 --> 00:11:32,784
Don't these boys ever get home?
Can't they be given a short leave?

137
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:35,871
- Certainly, if it's accrued.
- I don't want any leave.

138
00:11:35,912 --> 00:11:39,040
- You don't?
- Oh, of course I do. Dying to.

139
00:11:39,082 --> 00:11:42,169
We're all homesick
but personal feelings don't matter.

140
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:44,296
There's unfinished business here.

141
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:47,632
Now that we've won the war,
we mustn't lose the peace.

142
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:51,386
I hate to think of anybody
sitting in his lonely barracks

143
00:11:51,428 --> 00:11:53,305
with a birthday cake on his knees.

144
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:56,641
I won't have the cake on my knees.
I won't be alone.

145
00:11:57,684 --> 00:12:00,145
There'll be my buddies. I'll call them in.

146
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:03,482
We'll open up a case of root beer,
light the candles,

147
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:05,734
then Frankovitch and his ukulele.

148
00:12:05,775 --> 00:12:10,071
Some old songs.
Why, it'll be like back home... almost.

149
00:12:10,113 --> 00:12:11,948
Good to hear you talk like that.

150
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,159
General Finney wants you to go in his car.

151
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:15,660
I'll be right with you.

152
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:20,457
If you're a sample of the spirit
prevailing in Berlin, I feel better already.

153
00:12:20,499 --> 00:12:22,959
- I'm a sample, all right.
- Goodbye.

154
00:12:28,256 --> 00:12:31,009
You're losing something, Captain Pringle.

155
00:12:31,968 --> 00:12:33,637
My handkerchief.

156
00:12:33,678 --> 00:12:36,139
You blow your nose in nylon nowadays?

157
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:42,479
What do you know? There must have
been a mistake at the laundry.

158
00:12:42,521 --> 00:12:46,274
We got a crazy old laundress.
You know what happened to Frankovitch?

159
00:12:46,316 --> 00:12:49,986
He sent out his shorts and got back a girdle.
(Laughs)

160
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,031
(Groans)

161
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:11,675
Ask her how much.

162
00:13:11,716 --> 00:13:16,555
(Speaking German)

163
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:18,682
800 cigarettes, or coffee.

164
00:13:19,683 --> 00:13:22,727
(Speaking German)

165
00:13:40,245 --> 00:13:44,207
No. This watch gold. Gold for teeth.

166
00:13:44,249 --> 00:13:46,543
- A watch from steel.
- How's this?

167
00:13:46,585 --> 00:13:49,254
No, this silver. Want steel.

168
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:51,173
You want steel.

169
00:13:51,214 --> 00:13:55,510
No, want round watch, very big, nice face.

170
00:13:55,552 --> 00:13:59,514
You're tough. All right,
let's look in the other drawer.

171
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:05,145
(Cackles) Mickey Mouse! Mickey Mouse!

172
00:14:05,187 --> 00:14:07,272
- How much?
- $700.

173
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:11,776
- You got three like this watch, maybe?
- We'll see.

174
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:25,582
Herr Captain, buy porcelain?
Little Cupid to take for wife?

175
00:14:25,624 --> 00:14:28,752
Never mind the knick-knacks.
How much for the mattress?

176
00:14:28,793 --> 00:14:31,713
- Why you want the mattress?
- I'm sleepy.

177
00:14:31,755 --> 00:14:35,175
- How much for the mattress?
- (Speaking German)

178
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:39,471
What do you mean, "nein, nein, no"?

179
00:14:39,513 --> 00:14:41,556
Look what you can get for it.

180
00:14:41,598 --> 00:14:44,601
(Speaking German)

181
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:49,481
12 eggs in it and look at
the writing on it and the candles.

182
00:14:49,523 --> 00:14:53,068
The candles alone are worth the mattress.
Get lost.

183
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:55,278
(All speaking German)

184
00:16:18,737 --> 00:16:20,822
(Brakes squeal)

185
00:16:20,864 --> 00:16:22,949
(Honks horn)

186
00:16:52,896 --> 00:16:54,981
Yoo-hoo!

187
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:58,860
Erika! Erika!

188
00:17:09,704 --> 00:17:11,790
(Whistling cheerfully)

189
00:17:15,293 --> 00:17:17,337
(Speaks German)

190
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:21,174
Sit down, Johnny.

191
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:28,265
Go away, Johnny, sit down.

192
00:17:47,576 --> 00:17:49,244
Johnny.

193
00:17:49,286 --> 00:17:51,746
Johnny, what are you doing?

194
00:17:51,788 --> 00:17:54,958
- I'm wiping my face.
- You're hurting me, Johnny.

195
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,295
You're always hurting me.
Why are you so mean to me?

196
00:17:58,336 --> 00:18:01,673
I worry about you. I scrounge around,
I bring you presents

197
00:18:01,715 --> 00:18:03,425
and you tell me I'm mean to you.

198
00:18:03,467 --> 00:18:07,429
You brought me a present? Where is it?
Where have you got it?

199
00:18:07,471 --> 00:18:09,598
Ohh...

200
00:18:09,639 --> 00:18:13,935
Johnny, they're so sheer. So beautiful.

201
00:18:13,977 --> 00:18:17,272
52 gauge. So I'm mean to you?

202
00:18:17,314 --> 00:18:20,609
- No, you're good to me.
- You bet I am.

203
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:24,946
You don't know how good. I bought
you another present. You're not gonna get it.

204
00:18:24,988 --> 00:18:28,283
Another one? Where have you got it?
Where is it, Johnny?

205
00:18:28,325 --> 00:18:31,286
- Keep away.
- Is it here? Tell me...

206
00:18:32,621 --> 00:18:37,042
Johnny... (Speaks German)

207
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,920
- Where did you get it?
- A friend of mine baked it.

208
00:18:39,961 --> 00:18:43,924
Only you're not going to get it. Why
should I care whether you sleep or not?

209
00:18:43,965 --> 00:18:48,011
Johnny, for 15 years
we haven't slept in Germany.

210
00:18:48,053 --> 00:18:51,598
First it was Hitler screaming on the radio,
then the war of nerves,

211
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,934
then the victory celebrations,

212
00:18:53,975 --> 00:18:56,061
then the bombing.

213
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:58,188
All the furniture burnt.

214
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,106
See?

215
00:19:00,148 --> 00:19:02,192
(Springs crash and boing)

216
00:19:02,234 --> 00:19:05,695
That one I hate worst.
Give me that mattress, Johnny.

217
00:19:05,737 --> 00:19:07,823
No mattress will help you sleep.

218
00:19:07,864 --> 00:19:10,367
What you Germans need
is a better conscience.

219
00:19:10,408 --> 00:19:12,285
I have a good conscience.

220
00:19:12,327 --> 00:19:15,622
I have a new Führer now... you.

221
00:19:15,664 --> 00:19:16,998
Heil, Johnny.

222
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,793
You heil me once more
and I'll knock your teeth in.

223
00:19:19,835 --> 00:19:21,711
You'll bruise your lips.

224
00:19:21,753 --> 00:19:25,048
Why don't I choke you a little?
Break you in two?

225
00:19:25,882 --> 00:19:28,718
Build a fire under you, you blonde witch.

226
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,262
(Knock at door)

227
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:31,972
Who's that?

228
00:19:32,013 --> 00:19:34,099
With my luck, it's Eisenhower.

229
00:19:43,358 --> 00:19:45,443
- Yes.
- Your name Schlütow?

230
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:48,321
- I beg your pardon.
- Is your name Erika Schlütow?

231
00:19:48,363 --> 00:19:50,448
- No.
- You live here, don't you?

232
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,950
Yes, I live here.

233
00:19:51,992 --> 00:19:54,911
You the dame that sings
at the Lorelei nightclub?

234
00:19:54,953 --> 00:19:58,707
- Yes, I sing there.
- And your name's not Erika Schlütow?

235
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:02,544
My name is Erika von Schlütow.

236
00:20:02,586 --> 00:20:04,671
- A von?
- She's a von.

237
00:20:04,713 --> 00:20:07,632
Nobility. We beg your highness's pardon.

238
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:10,510
- What do you want?
- A little information.

239
00:20:10,552 --> 00:20:15,599
It says here that a certain Erika Schlütow...
von Schlütow, pardon I...

240
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,935
has been an active von Nazi
ever since 19 - von - 35.

241
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,355
Go on, gentlemen.

242
00:20:22,397 --> 00:20:25,775
It says that Miss von Schlütow
was ordered over a month ago

243
00:20:25,817 --> 00:20:28,653
to a von labour camp
to pick up some von bricks.

244
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:31,990
- What else does it say?
- You're working at a night joint.

245
00:20:32,032 --> 00:20:35,702
According to this report,
what you're moving there ain't bricks.

246
00:20:35,744 --> 00:20:40,790
I'm an artist, gentlemen, not a street
cleaner, and I've been completely cleared.

247
00:20:40,832 --> 00:20:42,918
Yeah? Tell us all about it.

248
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:46,505
My case has been reviewed
and the decision reversed.

249
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:48,840
I'm on the white list now.

250
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:54,763
With that record? If you make the white list,
we'll make the hit parade.

251
00:20:54,805 --> 00:20:57,516
- OK, von sister, get your things on.
- What for?

252
00:20:57,557 --> 00:21:01,102
We're taking you to
the von denazification office.

253
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,237
Now, Abbot and Costello,
show me your orders.

254
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:12,155
- Yes, sir.
- Who gave you these?

255
00:21:12,197 --> 00:21:14,282
- Lieutenant Clark, sir.
- Four weeks old.

256
00:21:14,324 --> 00:21:16,201
We've had a lot of people to check.

257
00:21:16,243 --> 00:21:19,788
Paperwork, that's why we're always
fouled up when a war starts.

258
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:23,375
Takes us six months to clear up
the paperwork from the last one.

259
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:26,336
I'll talk to Clark.
This case is straightened out.

260
00:21:26,378 --> 00:21:29,131
- Sorry, sir.
- OK. That's all. Take off.

261
00:21:32,801 --> 00:21:35,929
- May I have that, please?
- Sorry.

262
00:21:38,807 --> 00:21:43,103
Take an ordinary guy, make him an MP,
suddenly he gets to be eight feet tall.

263
00:21:43,145 --> 00:21:47,107
- If they look into the files for my papers.
- Stop worrying. They're OK.

264
00:21:47,149 --> 00:21:51,111
- Goodbye. I got a desk full of work.
- Did the Colonel sign my papers?

265
00:21:51,153 --> 00:21:55,115
Not exactly. He was out of the office
having his tonsils swabbed.

266
00:21:55,157 --> 00:21:58,451
- The duty officer signed them.
- Who was the duty officer?

267
00:21:58,493 --> 00:22:00,162
I was.

268
00:22:00,203 --> 00:22:04,374
Johnny, if they find out you know me,
that's very dangerous.

269
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:06,501
Everything is dangerous.

270
00:22:06,543 --> 00:22:11,214
I know an old lady back home,
broke her leg stepping into a church pew.

271
00:22:12,132 --> 00:22:14,009
See you, baby.

272
00:22:16,803 --> 00:22:20,098
Johnny! When you come back,
bring me some sugar.

273
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,017
- Yeah, sure.
- And some soap.

274
00:22:22,058 --> 00:22:24,144
And hairpins.

275
00:22:24,186 --> 00:22:28,148
- Anything else?
- A pillow to go with that mattress.

276
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,610
Ah, you gorgeous booby trap.

277
00:22:32,986 --> 00:22:34,529
Yahoo!

278
00:22:35,989 --> 00:22:37,908
(Siren wailing)

279
00:22:39,993 --> 00:22:42,162
On your left is the Russian war memorial,

280
00:22:42,204 --> 00:22:45,665
built in honour of their soldiers
killed in the battle of Berlin.

281
00:22:45,707 --> 00:22:48,794
Those tanks on the side
were the first to enter Berlin.

282
00:22:49,753 --> 00:22:53,507
Beyond it, the Reichstag,
the German house of representatives.

283
00:22:53,548 --> 00:22:57,844
That's the building set on fire in 1933
and blamed on a poor Dutchman.

284
00:22:57,886 --> 00:23:00,722
The word got out it was Hitler
who threw the match.

285
00:23:00,764 --> 00:23:06,061
They used to say it's the first time in history
a man gave himself the hotfoot.

286
00:23:06,102 --> 00:23:08,188
(Siren wailing)

287
00:23:10,565 --> 00:23:15,612
The Brandenburg Gate, an arch of triumph
until they got out of the habit.

288
00:23:15,654 --> 00:23:19,199
That rubble heap over there
was the American embassy.

289
00:23:19,241 --> 00:23:22,536
You can't tell now but this spot
was once the heart of Europe.

290
00:23:22,577 --> 00:23:24,871
The street is the famous Unter den Linden,

291
00:23:24,913 --> 00:23:28,667
named after the linden trees,
which they've replanted now.

292
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:31,461
That pile of stone over there
was the Adlon Hotel,

293
00:23:31,503 --> 00:23:35,257
just after the 8th Air Force
checked in for the weekend.

294
00:23:35,298 --> 00:23:37,968
Now, let's look at the Wilhelmstraße.

295
00:23:38,009 --> 00:23:39,594
(Siren wailing)

296
00:23:39,636 --> 00:23:43,640
Here's the Reich Chancellery where
the Führer fixed himself up a duplex.

297
00:23:43,682 --> 00:23:47,978
As it turned out, one part got to be a big
padded cell and the other a mortuary.

298
00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:50,105
Underneath is a concrete basement,

299
00:23:50,147 --> 00:23:53,733
where he married Eva Braun
and where they killed themselves.

300
00:23:53,775 --> 00:23:56,903
A lot of people say it was
the perfect honeymoon.

301
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:03,326
Over there is the balcony where he bet
his Reich would last a thousand years.

302
00:24:03,368 --> 00:24:06,663
That's the one that broke
the bookies' hearts.

303
00:24:09,207 --> 00:24:13,503
This is the Tiergarten,
used to be the Central Park of Berlin.

304
00:24:13,545 --> 00:24:18,216
Those two big cement things are
the zoo bunkers, enormous pillboxes.

305
00:24:18,258 --> 00:24:21,553
They were the last two buildings
in Berlin to surrender.

306
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:46,536
I thought you'd be interested
in a typical Berlin residential area.

307
00:24:46,578 --> 00:24:49,873
If you look hard,
you'll see the houses are empty shells,

308
00:24:49,915 --> 00:24:53,001
completely burned out by incendiaries.

309
00:24:53,043 --> 00:24:55,796
Life goes on in those ruins, though.

310
00:25:14,439 --> 00:25:17,484
That used to be
the largest department store in Berlin.

311
00:25:17,526 --> 00:25:22,823
It was 12 storeys high. Later on it became
headquarters for the storm troopers.

312
00:25:22,864 --> 00:25:28,161
They blew it up themselves.
The idea was to destroy all their records.

313
00:25:28,203 --> 00:25:32,874
They overlooked the fact that most
of them were in fireproof vaults.

314
00:25:53,728 --> 00:25:55,605
Excuse me.

315
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:02,988
Well.

316
00:26:03,905 --> 00:26:07,868
This is one of our youth clubs. We've
got a lot of them in the American zone.

317
00:26:07,909 --> 00:26:12,205
We had quite a problem. Those weren't
ordinary youngsters when we came in.

318
00:26:12,247 --> 00:26:16,626
They were mean old men. Now we're
trying to make kids of them again.

319
00:26:16,668 --> 00:26:20,422
We had to kick the goose step out of them
and cure them of blind obedience

320
00:26:20,464 --> 00:26:22,632
and teach them to beep at the referee.

321
00:26:22,674 --> 00:26:25,427
If they want to steal,
make sure it's second base.

322
00:26:27,762 --> 00:26:30,390
(Cheering)

323
00:26:30,432 --> 00:26:34,394
One thing they don't have to worry about
round here, breaking windows.

324
00:26:34,436 --> 00:26:37,898
One family has already
christened a kid DiMaggio Schultz.

325
00:26:37,939 --> 00:26:40,609
That's when I started believing
we'd won the war.

326
00:26:42,903 --> 00:26:46,031
- (Shouts in German)
- (All yelling)

327
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:55,290
(Man) Hey, Fräulein! Hey, Fräulein!

Oh, the singer. I think it's Erika.

- Erika what?
- Erika von Schlütow.

496
00:38:25,063 --> 00:38:26,523
Why do you ask about her?

497
00:38:26,565 --> 00:38:31,236
Because there's something funny going on
here and I'm not in the mood for laughs.

498
00:38:31,278 --> 00:38:33,572
Schlütow? How do you spell it?

499
00:38:33,613 --> 00:38:35,699
Schlütow, with an umlaut.

500
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,826
I thought so.

501
00:38:41,246 --> 00:38:44,166
I want you to remember
that when we moved into Germany,

502
00:38:44,207 --> 00:38:47,252
we found a country of
open graves and closed hearts.

503
00:38:47,294 --> 00:38:50,213
We've tried to turn it into a civilised state.

504
00:38:50,255 --> 00:38:54,009
We had to eliminate things
that breed unrest and aggression.

505
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:57,345
We've tried to make them free men
and give them some dignity.

506
00:38:57,387 --> 00:39:01,349
We had to return four million
displaced persons to their homes.

507
00:39:01,391 --> 00:39:04,144
That's hard if you don't have
a home to start with.

508
00:39:04,186 --> 00:39:07,355
We had to repair hospitals
and public utilities.

509
00:39:07,397 --> 00:39:10,942
I remember the first day the gasworks
started operating again.

510
00:39:10,984 --> 00:39:14,529
There were 160 suicides in Berlin alone.

511
00:39:14,571 --> 00:39:16,448
That was ten months ago.

512
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:20,786
Today, they take a match and light
the gas and boil some potatoes.

513
00:39:20,827 --> 00:39:24,581
Not many potatoes, mind you.
There is still a lot of hunger.

514
00:39:24,623 --> 00:39:26,833
But there is a new will to live.

515
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:31,546
We had to build schools and find teachers
and then teach the teachers.

516
00:39:31,588 --> 00:39:35,884
We helped them start a free press
and institute a parliamentary government.

517
00:39:35,926 --> 00:39:38,595
They had their first free election in 14 years.

518
00:39:38,637 --> 00:39:41,181
It had been so long
they didn't know what to do.

519
00:39:41,223 --> 00:39:44,518
It was like handing
the village drunk a glass of water.

520
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:50,232
What I want to point out is that
it's a tough, thankless, lonely job.

521
00:39:50,273 --> 00:39:52,567
We're trying to lick it as well as we can.

522
00:39:52,609 --> 00:39:56,154
You might as well know,
some of us get out of line occasionally.

523
00:39:56,196 --> 00:39:58,865
But remember this.
For the first time in history,

524
00:39:58,907 --> 00:40:03,745
you are asking the same generation of
soldiers to be both valorous and wise.

525
00:40:03,787 --> 00:40:05,664
- Mighty fine.
- Well said.

526
00:40:05,705 --> 00:40:09,459
I sure hope our chairman has
made notes of that speech of yours.

527
00:40:09,501 --> 00:40:12,254
I think it should be
incorporated in our report.

528
00:40:12,295 --> 00:40:15,590
Colonel, we buy every word of it, all of us.

529
00:40:15,632 --> 00:40:17,217
I don't.

530
00:40:18,218 --> 00:40:22,848
I wouldn't think of buying it. I'm surprised
at my colleagues' low sales resistance.

531
00:40:22,889 --> 00:40:26,434
Miss Frost, this attitude calls
for some explanation.

532
00:40:26,476 --> 00:40:28,770
Colonel Plummer, in your eloquent speech,

533
00:40:28,812 --> 00:40:31,106
which I'm sure you've made 50 times,

534
00:40:31,148 --> 00:40:35,110
you used the phrase "Some of our boys
may get out of line sometimes."

535
00:40:35,152 --> 00:40:37,445
That is a masterpiece of understatement.

536
00:40:37,487 --> 00:40:39,072
What are you driving at?

537
00:40:39,114 --> 00:40:43,952
In your effort to civilise this country,
our boys are becoming barbarians.

538
00:40:43,994 --> 00:40:47,289
- I explained on that tour...
- I know all about those tours.

539
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:51,918
You put blinkers on us and make sure
we only see what you want us to see.

540
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:55,714
Then you give us pamphlets,
statistics, a rousing speech

541
00:40:55,755 --> 00:40:58,884
and ship us back a little more
bamboozled than when we came.

542
00:40:58,925 --> 00:41:01,761
We could have learned
as much from Reader's Digest.

543
00:41:01,803 --> 00:41:05,348
- This is very embarrassing, Colonel.
- Go on, Miss Frost.

544
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:08,351
Well, I don't like blinkers.
I look in all directions

545
00:41:08,393 --> 00:41:13,023
and when I suspect dirt's been swept
under a carpet, I turn up that carpet.

546
00:41:13,064 --> 00:41:16,359
- What carpet? What dirt?
- What dirt?

547
00:41:16,401 --> 00:41:20,822
- One day and this is filled with it.
- Please particularise.

548
00:41:20,864 --> 00:41:23,700
Gls consorting with German Fräuleins...

549
00:41:23,742 --> 00:41:25,243
Fraternisation is legal.

550
00:41:25,285 --> 00:41:29,122
...in wide-open, shameless,
black-market nightclubs.

551
00:41:30,165 --> 00:41:34,127
So we close them and our boys sneak off
to places in the Russian sector,

552
00:41:34,169 --> 00:41:37,339
or the British, or in the French,
and there's another thing.

553
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:40,550
This is off the record.
Those places attract a lot of scum

554
00:41:40,592 --> 00:41:44,346
and we clean it up by cracking down
with a surprise raid once in a while.

555
00:41:44,387 --> 00:41:48,683
Notorious Nazi entertainers parading
themselves before our boys,

556
00:41:48,725 --> 00:41:51,770
- is that off the record too?
- For instance?

557
00:41:51,812 --> 00:41:56,399
I am specifically referring
to one Erika von Schlütow,

558
00:41:56,441 --> 00:42:01,655
who works at a dive called the Lorelei,
15 Hagenbachstraße.

559
00:42:01,696 --> 00:42:03,323
How can a creature...

560
00:42:08,745 --> 00:42:11,414
I insist on a satisfactory explanation.

561
00:42:11,456 --> 00:42:15,418
I must ask the Congresswoman
to drop this particular matter.

562
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:18,797
- Why?
- Some things must be left to our discretion.

563
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:23,510
Colonel Plummer, I didn't go for
the blinkers. Now, don't try a muzzle.

564
00:42:23,552 --> 00:42:27,097
The last time someone wanted to gag me,
he tried it with a mink coat

565
00:42:27,139 --> 00:42:32,936
but I never let go until the president of that
particular ship company wound up in jail,

566
00:42:32,978 --> 00:42:36,106
even though I did get
pneumonia that winter.

567
00:42:38,733 --> 00:42:41,862
Herr Maier, this is the second time
we've had complaints.

568
00:42:41,903 --> 00:42:45,323
I don't think it's a good idea
that your son... What's his name?

569
00:42:45,365 --> 00:42:46,450
Gerhard.

570
00:42:46,491 --> 00:42:51,163
That Gerhard should draw swastikas
all over the neighbourhood.

571
00:42:51,204 --> 00:42:53,623
(Chastises in German)

572
00:42:53,665 --> 00:42:57,085
- I will break his arm.
- We've dissolved the Gestapo.

573
00:42:57,127 --> 00:43:01,798
No food, Bürschchen.
I will lock him into a dark room.

574
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,925
Why not just shove him in a gas chamber?

575
00:43:03,967 --> 00:43:05,051
Yes, Herr Kapitän.

576
00:43:05,093 --> 00:43:07,929
Listen, we've done away
with concentration camps.

577
00:43:07,971 --> 00:43:11,475
Take him round to a G YA,
one of our German youth clubs.

578
00:43:11,516 --> 00:43:15,270
Some baseball and a little less
heel-clicking is what he needs.

579
00:43:15,312 --> 00:43:17,606
Here's the address. Ask for Sergeant Breen.

580
00:43:17,647 --> 00:43:19,524
Yes, Herr Kapitän.

581
00:43:20,358 --> 00:43:23,278
I mean, thank you, Herr Kapitän.

582
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,280
Auf Wiedersehen.

583
00:43:25,322 --> 00:43:27,407
Come, Bürschchen.

584
00:43:34,498 --> 00:43:37,626
- Captain Pringle is wanted in 112.
- Who's that?

585
00:43:37,667 --> 00:43:40,337
That Congress dame,
whatever her name is.

586
00:43:40,378 --> 00:43:42,047
- Wants to see me?
- You, sir.

587
00:43:42,088 --> 00:43:44,382
- Now?
- Now. She's clucking like a hen.

588
00:43:44,424 --> 00:43:47,677
You'd better get there
before she lays an egg.

589
00:44:04,236 --> 00:44:06,905
- Captain Pringle reporting.
- Hello.

590
00:44:07,739 --> 00:44:11,076
- Lorelei, how do you spell it?
- Lorelei?

591
00:44:11,118 --> 00:44:13,203
l-E or E-I at the end?

592
00:44:13,245 --> 00:44:14,913
E-I.

593
00:44:14,955 --> 00:44:16,832
Thank you.

594
00:44:19,376 --> 00:44:23,672
Captain Pringle, my belief in the army
has been shaken to the core.

595
00:44:23,713 --> 00:44:27,050
- Really?
- I can't trust anybody in uniform.

596
00:44:27,092 --> 00:44:28,718
Now, please...

597
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,429
With one single exception, you.

598
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:33,598
Thank you, ma'am.

599
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,934
I trust you because we're both Iowans.

600
00:44:35,976 --> 00:44:39,729
- Right back at you, Miss Frost.
- Moreover, you're a hard worker.

601
00:44:39,771 --> 00:44:42,232
Perhaps you work too hard. You look tired.

602
00:44:42,274 --> 00:44:44,568
Well, I hoped it didn't show.

603
00:44:46,278 --> 00:44:48,738
That is ink, Captain Pringle.

604
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,073
So it is.

605
00:44:50,115 --> 00:44:51,658
Captain, I need your help.

606
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:55,704
I want some additional data
on Fräulein von Schlütow.

607
00:44:55,745 --> 00:44:57,247
The one with the umlaut.

608
00:44:57,289 --> 00:45:01,084
- Oh, her.
- There must be a file on that woman.

609
00:45:01,126 --> 00:45:04,880
- Of course there is. Only it's not here.
- It isn't?

610
00:45:04,921 --> 00:45:07,674
I asked for it
and I was told it's gone to Nürnberg.

611
00:45:07,716 --> 00:45:11,011
On account of the trials,
a lot of files have been sent there.

612
00:45:11,052 --> 00:45:12,929
- I see.
- I asked around, though.

613
00:45:12,971 --> 00:45:15,932
- Did you find anything?
- Nothing important. Gossip.

614
00:45:15,974 --> 00:45:18,727
Are you sure? No fire with all that smoke?

615
00:45:18,768 --> 00:45:21,813
She may have known
a couple of minor party members.

616
00:45:21,855 --> 00:45:24,774
Nothing worth your attention.
Small fry, I'd say.

617
00:45:24,816 --> 00:45:27,569
- All right, ma'am, we're ready to go.
- Thank you.

618
00:45:27,611 --> 00:45:30,739
A warrant officer said he'd seen her
in an old newsreel,

619
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,450
so I sent for the film from the Signal Corp.

620
00:45:37,829 --> 00:45:39,706
(Pringle) The Week In Pictures.

621
00:45:42,667 --> 00:45:45,962
This is a little Nazi get-together in Breslau.

622
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:55,472
That's Goebbels telling them
how they're winning the war.

623
00:46:00,352 --> 00:46:03,396
Opening of the opera with Lohengrin
and famous guests.

624
00:46:03,438 --> 00:46:05,941
(Frost) They fiddled big while Berlin burned.

625
00:46:05,982 --> 00:46:08,777
Lohengrin, you know, swan song.

626
00:46:12,405 --> 00:46:17,285
(Frost) Now we're getting someplace.
I wonder what holds up that dress.

627
00:46:17,327 --> 00:46:19,955
(Pringle) Must be that German willpower.

628
00:46:19,996 --> 00:46:22,541
(Frost) Who's that man?
(Pringle) I think it's Birgel.

629
00:46:22,582 --> 00:46:25,168
(Frost) Who?
(Pringle) Hans Otto Birgel.

630
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:27,295
(Frost) Who is Hans Otto Birgel?

631
00:46:27,337 --> 00:46:30,924
(Pringle) He had something to do
with the Gestapo. He's dead.

632
00:46:30,966 --> 00:46:36,888
- Killed himself when the Russians came.
- (Frost) An important party member?

633
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:38,807
(Pringle) So-so.

634
00:46:38,849 --> 00:46:41,935
(Frost) Well, she must be his girlfriend.

635
00:46:41,977 --> 00:46:44,729
Maybe she doesn't know him.
Maybe she had a dizzy spell

636
00:46:44,771 --> 00:46:47,774
and the first thing she could catch
was his... elbow.

637
00:47:14,301 --> 00:47:16,595
(Frost) That's enough. Thank you.

638
00:47:18,847 --> 00:47:23,018
Well, we've learned one thing.
No small fry is she.

639
00:47:23,059 --> 00:47:26,229
- I guess not.
- That a Nazi woman like that should...

640
00:47:26,271 --> 00:47:29,566
I'll see she discontinues
her appearances as an entertainer.

641
00:47:29,608 --> 00:47:31,902
- Will that be satisfactory?
- It will not.

642
00:47:31,943 --> 00:47:34,613
What would you suggest, shave her head?

643
00:47:34,654 --> 00:47:36,323
- I'm not after her head.
- Well?

644
00:47:36,364 --> 00:47:40,118
It's common talk that an officer
in the army is protecting her.

645
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,705
- It's his head I'm after.
- You really think an officer?

646
00:47:43,747 --> 00:47:45,624
Incredible as it may seem.

647
00:47:45,665 --> 00:47:47,959
Now, let's use some common sense.

648
00:47:48,001 --> 00:47:51,755
That man is not giving her
his protection for platonic reasons.

649
00:47:51,797 --> 00:47:53,882
- Granted?
- Granted.

650
00:47:53,924 --> 00:47:56,384
Of course the association is undercover.

651
00:47:56,426 --> 00:47:59,471
He's not stupid enough
to entertain her at his billet.

652
00:47:59,513 --> 00:48:03,475
- I guess that's right.
- We can therefore assume he visits her.

653
00:48:03,517 --> 00:48:05,602
Very logical.

654
00:48:05,644 --> 00:48:09,189
Therefore, to catch him,
we must watch her place.

655
00:48:09,231 --> 00:48:11,107
Smart idea.

656
00:48:11,149 --> 00:48:13,985
- You know where she lives?
- I can find out.

657
00:48:14,027 --> 00:48:17,322
And I shall watch it
day and night... personally.

658
00:48:17,364 --> 00:48:20,033
No, we'll watch it together, the two of us.

659
00:48:20,075 --> 00:48:23,620
- We will?
- Yes. I want to be an eyewitness.

660
00:48:23,662 --> 00:48:27,249
I want to see that man myself
and face him down.

661
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:29,751
Can you afford the time, Miss Frost?

662
00:48:29,793 --> 00:48:33,547
Any time it requires.
This I intend to make my case in point.

663
00:48:33,588 --> 00:48:35,465
You'll go to the General?

664
00:48:35,507 --> 00:48:39,678
I will, and to the War Department
and to the President.

665
00:48:40,554 --> 00:48:43,849
And if that doesn't do it,
I'll see Gabriel Heatter.

666
00:48:56,194 --> 00:48:59,739
It's well after curfew.
I wonder if he's coming tonight.

667
00:48:59,781 --> 00:49:02,617
- He'll be here.
- Yeah?

668
00:49:02,659 --> 00:49:06,079
I don't think you understand
about arrangements like this.

669
00:49:06,121 --> 00:49:08,790
They work 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.

670
00:49:08,832 --> 00:49:10,917
Does the CIO know about this?

671
00:49:14,212 --> 00:49:17,507
Are you sure there aren't
any back stairs to that apartment?

672
00:49:17,549 --> 00:49:19,217
There isn't even any back wall.

673
00:49:19,259 --> 00:49:22,387
She must be waiting for somebody.
Why leave the lights on?

674
00:49:22,429 --> 00:49:25,640
Maybe she's knitting
or putting up pickled peaches.

675
00:49:26,266 --> 00:49:28,351
Only we know better.

676
00:49:33,148 --> 00:49:35,192
Pickled peaches.

677
00:49:36,401 --> 00:49:40,113
I bet you miss Iowa. I do already.

678
00:49:41,615 --> 00:49:44,910
- It's changed since you've been there.
- Yeah?

679
00:49:44,951 --> 00:49:47,954
A lot has happened, especially in Murdoch.

680
00:49:47,996 --> 00:49:50,832
- Do you remember Union Street?
- Mm-hm.

681
00:49:50,874 --> 00:49:55,545
Well, they've changed the name.
Now it's called Iwo Jima Boulevard.

682
00:49:55,587 --> 00:49:58,882
- That's news.
- And there was a post office scandal.

683
00:49:58,924 --> 00:50:02,677
- Yeah?
- About the new mural in the post office.

684
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:05,388
The town collected $2,000 to hire a painter.

685
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:08,725
The mayor got his cousin
from Chicago to do it.

686
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:11,061
- That's nice.
- It was 80 feet long.

687
00:50:11,102 --> 00:50:13,063
Supposed to be Custer's last stand.

688
00:50:13,104 --> 00:50:16,858
After the cousin left town,
they found out it wasn't an original.

689
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:19,653
He copied the whole thing from a beer ad.

690
00:50:19,694 --> 00:50:21,196
(Pringle) Hm.

691
00:50:21,238 --> 00:50:25,784
- There was an awful lot of trouble.
- You take Iowa seriously, don't you?

692
00:50:25,826 --> 00:50:28,286
Yes, I guess I do. I like it. Don't you?

693
00:50:28,328 --> 00:50:29,830
Mm-hm.

694
00:50:29,871 --> 00:50:33,416
We won a lot of honours last year,
all the 4H prizes.

695
00:50:33,458 --> 00:50:35,127
It's getting a little chilly.

696
00:50:35,168 --> 00:50:38,713
We had the lowest juvenile delinquency rate
until two months ago.

697
00:50:38,755 --> 00:50:39,881
What happened?

698
00:50:39,923 --> 00:50:43,218
A boy in Des Moines took
a blowtorch to his grandmother.

699
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:46,555
We fell clear down to 16th place.
It was humiliating.

700
00:50:46,596 --> 00:50:48,598
(Horn honks)

701
00:50:56,314 --> 00:50:58,233
(Key clinks)

702
00:50:58,275 --> 00:50:59,943
What's that?

703
00:50:59,985 --> 00:51:02,821
- Crickets.
- Something dropped.

704
00:51:02,863 --> 00:51:05,532
- How's that?
- Something metallic.

705
00:51:05,574 --> 00:51:07,451
Metallic?

706
00:51:13,081 --> 00:51:14,958
Look, it's a key.

707
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,294
A key? Whatever for?

708
00:51:17,335 --> 00:51:20,630
Evidently the man honks the horn
and that's the signal.

709
00:51:20,672 --> 00:51:23,133
You know more about
these things than I do.

710
00:51:23,175 --> 00:51:25,260
(Erika) Johnny? Johnny?

711
00:51:30,223 --> 00:51:32,309
Where are you, Johnny?

712
00:51:33,143 --> 00:51:34,644
Johnny?

713
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:41,735
- Johnny.
- There are a lot of Johnnys in the army.

714
00:51:41,776 --> 00:51:44,070
- Now we're getting someplace.
- Where?

715
00:51:44,112 --> 00:51:47,407
This eliminates all the Jims,
the Bobs and the Georges.

716
00:51:47,449 --> 00:51:49,534
Too bad his name isn't Zachary.

717
00:51:49,576 --> 00:51:51,661
Yes, that would simplify it.

718
00:51:51,703 --> 00:51:53,830
(Door opening)

719
00:52:06,718 --> 00:52:08,178
Johnny.

720
00:52:11,097 --> 00:52:14,226
I... don't know who you refer to.

721
00:52:14,267 --> 00:52:15,936
I am Captain Pringle

722
00:52:15,977 --> 00:52:20,273
and I have with me a member
of the Congress of the United States.

723
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:23,235
Good evening.

724
00:52:23,276 --> 00:52:26,196
- You are Erika von Schlütow?
- I am.

725
00:52:26,238 --> 00:52:30,033
We have reason to believe you're
consorting with a member of our army.

726
00:52:30,075 --> 00:52:33,703
- You have?
- We think you're expecting him now.

727
00:52:33,573 --> 00:52:36,868
- What gives you that idea?
- The key you dropped.

728
00:52:38,495 --> 00:52:42,540
- Maybe I dropped it for the milkman.
- Oh.

729
00:52:42,582 --> 00:52:44,250
She dropped it for the milkman.

730
00:52:45,085 --> 00:52:49,047
Fräulein, if that's supposed to be a joke,
you're joking up the wrong tree.

731
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:52,092
Let me assure you,
we are in no mood for flippancy.

732
00:52:52,175 --> 00:52:54,844
- Facts, if you please.
- Yes, facts.

733
00:52:56,763 --> 00:52:59,849
- You are an American woman?
- We'll ask the questions.

734
00:52:59,933 --> 00:53:02,352
- What is the name of the man?
- Yes.

735
00:53:02,435 --> 00:53:04,687
- Johnny.
- Johnny what?

736
00:53:04,771 --> 00:53:07,440
I see you do not believe in lipstick.

737
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,194
And what a curious way to do your hair,
or rather not to do it.

738
00:53:11,277 --> 00:53:13,988
Wait a minute.
Do you know who you're taking to?

739
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:18,701
An American woman, and I'm a little
disappointed, to tell you the truth.

740
00:53:18,785 --> 00:53:22,580
We apparently have a false idea
about the chic American woman.

741
00:53:22,622 --> 00:53:27,502
- I suppose it's publicity from Hollywood.
- You're being impertinent.

742
00:53:27,544 --> 00:53:31,881
Well, I must go back now. There's
a curfew for German civilians, you know.

743
00:53:31,965 --> 00:53:33,758
There sure is.

744
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:37,345
Fräulein von Schlütow,
we increased our national debt

745
00:53:37,387 --> 00:53:43,101
by some $350 billion to win this war.
I would regard it as a waste

746
00:53:43,184 --> 00:53:46,688
- if we didn't eliminate types like you.
- Like you.

747
00:53:50,984 --> 00:53:55,613
Perhaps if you would change
the line of your eyebrows a little.

748
00:53:55,697 --> 00:53:57,741
Gute Nacht.

749
00:53:57,824 --> 00:54:01,077
Gute Nacht,
Captain... whatever your name is.

750
00:54:05,749 --> 00:54:08,793
What nerve. What colossal nerve.

751
00:54:08,835 --> 00:54:12,130
We have to remember what
they've been through.

752
00:54:12,172 --> 00:54:15,341
All those bombings left them
kind of wobbly up here.

753
00:54:15,425 --> 00:54:18,303
- I do look awful without make-up.
- You don't.

754
00:54:18,344 --> 00:54:21,473
We were only allowed 60lbs of luggage.
No nonessentials.

755
00:54:21,514 --> 00:54:26,102
Never listen to another woman if you want
to know how you look. Ask a man.

756
00:54:26,186 --> 00:54:28,605
- Come on, ask me.
- I know how I look.

757
00:54:28,688 --> 00:54:33,276
You look charming, positively,
definitely, absolutely charming...

758
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:35,779
in a... refreshing sort of way.

759
00:54:35,862 --> 00:54:38,531
- Are you being polite?
- Who wants perfume?

760
00:54:38,531 --> 00:54:43,203
Give me the fresh wet smell
of Iowa corn right after it rains.

761
00:54:43,286 --> 00:54:46,206
We had little rain this year,
wonderful corn weather.

762
00:54:46,289 --> 00:54:48,291
I'm sure glad to hear that.

763
00:54:49,125 --> 00:54:51,878
- Now to get back to that woman.
- Must we?

764
00:54:51,961 --> 00:54:54,964
To be as insulting as that,
she must feel awfully safe.

765
00:54:55,006 --> 00:54:56,674
Or just bluffing.

766
00:54:56,716 --> 00:55:00,011
The man behind her
must be really important.

767
00:55:00,053 --> 00:55:02,347
A general or a colonel.

768
00:55:02,388 --> 00:55:04,432
A colonel at least.

769
00:55:06,142 --> 00:55:08,603
What's the full name of that colonel?

770
00:55:08,645 --> 00:55:11,314
- Colonel?
- That Colonel Plummer.

771
00:55:11,397 --> 00:55:13,233
- Rufus J Plummer.
- J for what?

772
00:55:13,316 --> 00:55:15,360
J for John.

773
00:55:15,443 --> 00:55:16,945
Do you think?

774
00:55:16,986 --> 00:55:21,282
No, not him. It couldn't be him.
He's a married man. A West Pointer.

775
00:55:21,324 --> 00:55:23,993
I've heard of married men,
of West Pointers, even.

776
00:55:24,077 --> 00:55:28,331
- But not Plummer, ma'am, I swear.
- There was a look in his eye.

777
00:55:28,415 --> 00:55:32,335
If we could only get our hands on her file.
Who told you it was sent to Nürnberg?

778
00:55:32,419 --> 00:55:36,965
- Second Lieutenant Cook, in charge of files.
- Maybe he's covering up for his colonel.

779
00:55:37,006 --> 00:55:40,844
- I'll ask him tomorrow morning.
- No. We'll go there now.

780
00:55:40,927 --> 00:55:42,554
- Where?
- To the files.

781
00:55:42,595 --> 00:55:45,515
In the middle of the night?
Shouldn't we get permission?

782
00:55:45,598 --> 00:55:49,102
Did we get permission
to land in Normandy? Let's go.

783
00:56:03,283 --> 00:56:06,161
Schlütow, Schlütow.

784
00:56:06,202 --> 00:56:08,288
S... SA...

785
00:56:12,375 --> 00:56:15,170
SCH to ST. This is where it would be.

786
00:56:15,211 --> 00:56:17,088
If it is at all, but I don't think it is.

787
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:19,799
- Well, let's make good and sure.
- Sure.

788
00:56:21,384 --> 00:56:23,845
Come on, open it.

789
00:56:23,887 --> 00:56:27,640
Schlage, Schlangenberg,
Schlagenspitz, Schlitz...

790
00:56:27,724 --> 00:56:30,977
Seems that some of them
never got to Milwaukee.

791
00:56:31,895 --> 00:56:34,689
Schliemann, Schlüssel, Schlütow...

792
00:56:34,731 --> 00:56:36,816
- There.
- Here's the Schlütows.

793
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:42,697
Anton, Emil, Fritz, Gottfried, Waldemar...

794
00:56:42,739 --> 00:56:44,824
- No Erika.
- No Erika.

795
00:56:44,908 --> 00:56:48,036
Told you so. Gone to Nürnberg.
Gone to Nürnberg.

796
00:56:48,078 --> 00:56:50,371
I'll take you back to your billet.

797
00:56:51,331 --> 00:56:53,374
Erika von Schlütow.

798
00:56:53,416 --> 00:56:55,293
- Yes?
- It's under von.

799
00:56:55,335 --> 00:56:56,795
Oh, no.

800
00:56:56,836 --> 00:57:00,381
Like O'Brien. You wouldn't
look under B, you'd look under O.

801
00:57:00,423 --> 00:57:03,259
- All right, let's look under O.
- Under V.

802
00:57:06,096 --> 00:57:09,432
- V as in vindictive.
- What was that, Captain?

803
00:57:09,516 --> 00:57:11,559
I pity anybody who has you on his trail.

804
00:57:11,601 --> 00:57:14,896
You pity a man who's consorting
with a notorious Nazi?

805
00:57:14,938 --> 00:57:16,606
Von Resnicek, von Reudesheim...

806
00:57:16,689 --> 00:57:19,943
Did it occur to you there might be
extenuating circumstances?

807
00:57:19,984 --> 00:57:22,529
I expect any man in his country's uniform...

808
00:57:22,612 --> 00:57:26,157
Oh, that one.
You expect him to be an ambassador.

809
00:57:26,199 --> 00:57:29,953
A salesman of goodwill. You want him
to stand on the blackened rubble

810
00:57:30,036 --> 00:57:32,288
of what used to be the corner of a street

811
00:57:32,372 --> 00:57:34,624
with a sample case of assorted freedoms,

812
00:57:34,707 --> 00:57:36,876
waving the flag and the Bill of Rights.

813
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,337
That's not the way it works.

814
00:57:39,379 --> 00:57:43,133
Suppose you stop and ask yourself
how come he skidded of the road?

815
00:57:43,216 --> 00:57:47,470
- I'll tell you how. No moral brakes.
- That's it, going too fast.

816
00:57:47,554 --> 00:57:49,973
During the war, he couldn't go fast enough.

817
00:57:50,056 --> 00:57:54,769
"Get on that beachhead, through the
tank traps, across the Rhine. Step on it."

818
00:57:54,853 --> 00:58:00,400
Faster, 100 miles an hour,
24 hours a day through burning towns.

819
00:58:00,483 --> 00:58:02,318
Then one day the war is over.

820
00:58:02,402 --> 00:58:05,488
You expect him to jam on those brakes
and stop like that.

821
00:58:05,572 --> 00:58:07,615
Everybody can't stop like that!

822
00:58:07,657 --> 00:58:11,953
Sometimes you skid, sometimes you go
into a spin and smash into a tree

823
00:58:11,995 --> 00:58:17,041
and bash your fenders and scrape those
fine ideals you brought from home.

824
00:58:17,083 --> 00:58:19,753
It's time such wrecks
were hauled into a garage.

825
00:58:19,836 --> 00:58:23,757
- Anyone who forgets he's American...
- Don't forget he's also human.

826
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,884
What would you know about that?

827
00:58:27,761 --> 00:58:29,220
Von Schlegel, von Schlittenheim...

828
00:58:29,429 --> 00:58:33,933
The loneliness is stored up right down
to his boots and it's driving him crazy.

829
00:58:34,017 --> 00:58:36,895
One day a pair of
open-toed shoes come along.

830
00:58:36,936 --> 00:58:41,274
You want him to ask questions?
Party affiliation? Social Security number?

831
00:58:41,357 --> 00:58:44,819
Yes, I want him to make sure
he's not doing something subversive.

832
00:58:44,861 --> 00:58:49,157
Are you qualified to call the pitch on this?
What's your life, anyway?

833
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:51,951
Committees and sessions
and adjournments

834
00:58:52,035 --> 00:58:54,079
and budget cuts and appropriations.

835
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:57,957
What do you do for laughs? What do you
do for tears for that matter?

836
00:59:00,126 --> 00:59:04,380
For tears... for tears I cry, Captain Pringle.

837
00:59:04,464 --> 00:59:06,674
It may interest you to know
I once cried for a man

838
00:59:06,716 --> 00:59:08,885
till my eyes were
half washed out of my head.

839
00:59:08,968 --> 00:59:11,096
Not really.

840
00:59:11,137 --> 00:59:15,934
I was on an important subcommittee.
One was a Southern Democrat.

841
00:59:15,975 --> 00:59:18,937
His convictions
were utterly different from mine.

842
00:59:18,978 --> 00:59:23,274
I hated everything he stood for.
I despised his politics.

843
00:59:23,316 --> 00:59:26,152
But I loved him... insanely.

844
00:59:27,404 --> 00:59:30,115
I loved the Southern syrup in his voice.

845
00:59:30,990 --> 00:59:33,410
His mint julep manners.

846
00:59:33,493 --> 00:59:36,996
The way he'd look at me
through his long thick eyelashes

847
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,332
when I was vetoing an amendment.

848
00:59:40,667 --> 00:59:45,338
He'd put his arm around me,
just kind of lazy, like.

849
00:59:46,756 --> 00:59:49,509
Lean his head against my cheek.

850
00:59:49,592 --> 00:59:53,096
His hair had a deep wave in it.

851
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:57,809
- You know what he was trying to do?
- What?

852
00:59:58,852 --> 01:00:00,937
He was trying to sway my vote.

853
01:00:03,523 --> 01:00:06,776
Once he drove me home
from an all-night meeting,

854
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:09,112
stopped his car on Earl Street.

855
01:00:09,195 --> 01:00:13,450
For no reason at all, he said,
except he was yearning for my lips.

856
01:00:14,951 --> 01:00:17,954
To tell you the truth, I was yearning for his.

857
01:00:19,372 --> 01:00:23,042
But it would have meant betraying
my platform and my constituents.

858
01:00:23,126 --> 01:00:25,378
- What did you do?
- I filibustered.

859
01:00:25,462 --> 01:00:27,881
- You what?
- I just kept on talking.

860
01:00:27,964 --> 01:00:32,969
The constitution, the Bill of Rights, poems,
Longfellow, anything I could think of.

861
01:00:33,052 --> 01:00:37,307
Von Schloss, von Schlotzing,
von Schlumann, von Schlürmann,

862
01:00:37,390 --> 01:00:39,225
von...

863
01:00:42,145 --> 01:00:45,190
- No other man since the mint julep guy?
- No.

864
01:00:45,231 --> 01:00:47,901
- No more what you call yearning?
- No.

865
01:00:49,652 --> 01:00:52,322
- Sure?
- None of your business.

866
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:58,495
I've been doing a little yearning
ever since you stepped off that plane.

867
01:00:59,496 --> 01:01:01,581
Captain Pringle!

868
01:01:03,083 --> 01:01:06,086
- Don't!
- Why not? You're not a Nazi.

869
01:01:06,169 --> 01:01:09,422
Don't tell me it's subversive
to kiss a Republican.

870
01:01:14,594 --> 01:01:16,429
I am a Congresswoman.

871
01:01:16,513 --> 01:01:20,433
Yeah. Now I know how I'll cast
my absentee ballot come re-election.

872
01:01:20,517 --> 01:01:24,312
- I'm here on official business.
- This is official.

873
01:01:24,354 --> 01:01:27,148
Oh! Now, listen.

874
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:29,109
Listen.

875
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:33,446
"Listen, my children, and you shall hear
of the midnight ride of Paul Revere

876
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:37,450
"On the 18th of April in '75,
hardly a man is now alive

877
01:01:37,492 --> 01:01:40,245
"Who remembers that famous day and year

878
01:01:41,037 --> 01:01:45,417
"He said to his friend, 'lf the British march
by land or sea from the town tonight

879
01:01:45,458 --> 01:01:50,505
"'Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch
of the North Church tower as a signal light

880
01:01:50,547 --> 01:01:53,007
"'One if by land and two if by sea

881
01:01:53,091 --> 01:01:57,220
"'And I on the opposite shore shall be
ready to ride and spread the alarm

882
01:01:57,303 --> 01:01:59,722
"'Through every Middlesex village and farm

883
01:01:59,806 --> 01:02:02,517
"'For the country folk to be up and to arm... '

884
01:02:04,144 --> 01:02:09,649
"Then he said 'Good night! '
and, with muffled oar, silent..." Oh!

885
01:02:09,732 --> 01:02:12,152
(Moans)

886
01:02:13,987 --> 01:02:17,031
Now, Congresswoman,
may I have the floor?

887
01:02:18,575 --> 01:02:20,660
You are entirely out of order.

888
01:02:20,744 --> 01:02:22,787
Objection overruled.

889
01:02:45,518 --> 01:02:47,729
Ooh. Oh.

890
01:02:47,771 --> 01:02:50,231
Just, er, checking up on Paul Revere.

891
01:02:51,649 --> 01:02:54,861
Oh, sure.

892
01:03:56,673 --> 01:04:00,385
This is where you live, Congresswoman.
This is your billet.

893
01:04:02,262 --> 01:04:05,181
I said we're here. What's the matter?

894
01:04:07,016 --> 01:04:10,311
- I just want to die.
- You what?

895
01:04:10,353 --> 01:04:13,022
It's awful. It never should have happened.

896
01:04:13,106 --> 01:04:16,109
Listen, you didn't burn down an orphanage.

897
01:04:16,192 --> 01:04:18,653
You got kissed in a file room. That's all.

898
01:04:18,695 --> 01:04:20,989
- I'm a thief.
- Thief?

899
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:24,284
The lowest kind of a thief,
stealing another woman's man.

900
01:04:25,118 --> 01:04:26,161
Yeah?

901
01:04:26,202 --> 01:04:28,663
The cake I brought. The girl you left behind.

902
01:04:28,705 --> 01:04:31,708
She sent a love letter and you fell in love
with the postman.

903
01:04:31,791 --> 01:04:35,503
Those things happen, like electrons,
positive and negative.

904
01:04:35,545 --> 01:04:38,840
- One day they get together and wham!
- No!

905
01:04:38,882 --> 01:04:40,592
No wham.

906
01:04:40,633 --> 01:04:43,803
- We've got to get control of ourselves.
- Can we?

907
01:04:43,887 --> 01:04:46,306
It would be wiser
not to see each other again.

908
01:04:46,389 --> 01:04:50,518
- I suppose it would.
- We can't go on with our investigation.

909
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:53,855
- So we drop it.
- No. No, I'll go on alone.

910
01:04:54,898 --> 01:04:58,026
- I could enlist the help of the general.
- No.

911
01:04:58,068 --> 01:04:59,527
Why not?

912
01:04:59,569 --> 01:05:04,866
Miss Frost, Congresswoman,
Postman, darling,

913
01:05:04,908 --> 01:05:08,870
to know that you're here and around
and I couldn't see you, I'd go crazy.

914
01:05:08,912 --> 01:05:10,538
We've got to be strong.

915
01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:15,335
This business about Dusty, it's not serious.
It's just a college crush.

916
01:05:15,418 --> 01:05:18,671
- I have a dreadful sense of guilt.
- We're not engaged.

917
01:05:18,755 --> 01:05:21,466
I'm not committed in any way.

918
01:05:21,508 --> 01:05:26,679
It would break her heart, the daughter of
the man who swung the 4th Precinct.

919
01:05:26,763 --> 01:05:30,266
No, it won't.
She's a kind of a flighty kid, you know.

920
01:05:30,350 --> 01:05:33,269
She's been engaged to four guys
since I've been gone,

921
01:05:33,353 --> 01:05:35,772
one of them a feed and grain merchant.

922
01:05:35,855 --> 01:05:38,525
Think what a good provider he'd make.

923
01:05:38,608 --> 01:05:40,235
Oh, John...

924
01:05:41,027 --> 01:05:44,989
I don't even know your first name,
Congresswoman darling.

925
01:05:45,031 --> 01:05:47,117
- Phoebe.
- Phoebe.

926
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,035
Isn't that ridiculous?

927
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:51,162
Not a bit ridiculous.

928
01:05:53,206 --> 01:05:55,917
How about a good-night kiss, Phoebe?

929
01:05:58,044 --> 01:06:00,088
Good night.

930
01:06:04,134 --> 01:06:06,136
Good morning.

931
01:06:10,223 --> 01:06:12,517
Good evening.

932
01:06:17,230 --> 01:06:19,274
Good gracious.

933
01:06:27,323 --> 01:06:33,121
(Man) The problem is how to stop
all this physical human contact...

934
01:06:36,416 --> 01:06:40,295
We just ought to put our foot down
and put it down hard.

935
01:06:40,336 --> 01:06:42,630
- Why, Miss Frost.
- Where have you been?

936
01:06:42,672 --> 01:06:45,592
- We've been worried.
- Won't you join us?

937
01:06:45,675 --> 01:06:47,469
- Miss Frost?
- Miss Frost?

938
01:07:15,288 --> 01:07:17,332
Anything I can do for you?

939
01:07:18,374 --> 01:07:20,460
Not a thing.

940
01:07:23,046 --> 01:07:26,966
Hah... (Wails)

941
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:48,405
- Hans Otto Birgel.
- That's the best we could find, Colonel.

942
01:07:48,488 --> 01:07:51,825
The others without uniform
don't show his face so plainly.

943
01:07:51,908 --> 01:07:55,829
Lovely master race type.
I bet he never tortured anybody.

944
01:07:55,912 --> 01:07:58,915
Not until he made sure
his dachshund had had his dinner.

945
01:07:58,998 --> 01:08:01,418
I want every MP to memorise this puss.

946
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:09,759
Have 100 copies printed. Send it around
with a detailed description.

947
01:08:09,843 --> 01:08:11,052
Will do.

948
01:08:11,094 --> 01:08:13,847
We've got the trap baited
with the right cheese.

949
01:08:13,930 --> 01:08:16,182
He'll snap at it, sure as shooting.

950
01:08:17,350 --> 01:08:19,602
- I hope.
- (Knock at door)

951
01:08:19,686 --> 01:08:22,105
Come in.

952
01:08:22,188 --> 01:08:24,858
- You wanted to see me, Colonel?
- Yes, Miss Frost.

953
01:08:24,858 --> 01:08:27,152
- That'll be all, Major.
- Yes, sir.

954
01:08:28,278 --> 01:08:30,697
- How is the investigation going?
- The what?

955
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:33,032
- The investigation.
- Oh, fine.

956
01:08:33,116 --> 01:08:35,994
- Making any progress?
- Slowly. Why?

957
01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:39,664
It seems, in the course of it,
you lost something.

958
01:08:39,706 --> 01:08:42,167
- I have?
- This is yours, isn't it?

959
01:08:43,293 --> 01:08:47,547
Yes, thank you very much.
Well, I guess I'd better get some hatpins.

960
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:51,342
It is pretty windy in Berlin,
especially at night.

961
01:08:53,970 --> 01:08:57,265
Well, the whole thing
can be easily explained.

962
01:09:03,229 --> 01:09:08,234
But I hardly think you're in a position
to cast a stone, Colonel Plummer.

963
01:09:08,318 --> 01:09:11,404
- I'm very sorry.
- I think you're brazen.

964
01:09:11,488 --> 01:09:12,655
Am I?

965
01:09:12,739 --> 01:09:16,409
- Having that on your desk.
- Having what on my desk?

966
01:09:16,493 --> 01:09:20,997
I know all about that going
100 miles an hour, then the war is over

967
01:09:21,081 --> 01:09:23,333
but you can't stop like that.

968
01:09:23,416 --> 01:09:25,835
But there is such a thing as discretion.

969
01:09:26,669 --> 01:09:30,131
- What discretion?
- Is this your family?

970
01:09:30,173 --> 01:09:33,093
Yes, and this is our house in Indiana.

971
01:09:33,176 --> 01:09:35,595
- How long have you been married?
- 22 years.

972
01:09:35,678 --> 01:09:39,182
Oh, no. Perhaps it would be a good idea
if you sent for your wife.

973
01:09:39,265 --> 01:09:41,684
She can't come now.
We're expecting a baby.

974
01:09:41,768 --> 01:09:44,687
- A baby?
- I mean, our older daughter is.

975
01:09:44,771 --> 01:09:49,484
I can understand the temptation of
a young man over here but a grandfather...

976
01:09:49,526 --> 01:09:53,488
Really, Colonel Plummer,
you should have your brakes relined.

977
01:10:15,135 --> 01:10:17,220
John. John, now I know.

978
01:10:17,303 --> 01:10:19,556
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

979
01:10:19,639 --> 01:10:22,058
- I found out. There can't be any doubt.
- What?

980
01:10:22,142 --> 01:10:23,977
- He even has her picture.
- Who?

981
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:25,562
- Colonel Plummer.
- Whose?

982
01:10:25,645 --> 01:10:27,605
- That woman's.
- How come?

983
01:10:27,647 --> 01:10:29,733
I mean, what for?

984
01:10:29,816 --> 01:10:32,444
To look at. He can't keep his eyes off her.

985
01:10:32,485 --> 01:10:36,030
It must be a mistake.
Maybe it's somebody who looks like her.

986
01:10:36,114 --> 01:10:38,116
Should I talk it over with the general?

987
01:10:38,199 --> 01:10:41,161
- I wouldn't. Not the general.
- (Buzzer)

988
01:10:41,244 --> 01:10:45,498
Excuse me. Denazification office,
Captain Pringle speaking.

989
01:10:46,374 --> 01:10:49,669
- Who?
- Johnny, what has happened?

990
01:10:49,753 --> 01:10:53,006
Why didn't you come last night?
I waited for you.

991
01:10:53,089 --> 01:10:55,341
Johnny, are you listening?

992
01:10:55,383 --> 01:11:00,722
Of course I am, Lieutenant... Forrestal.

993
01:11:00,764 --> 01:11:03,057
Lieutenant Forrestal, quartermasters.

994
01:11:03,099 --> 01:11:07,771
Well, Lieutenant, I'm sorry I couldn't
make it. I'm pretty busy these days.

995
01:11:07,854 --> 01:11:13,526
Johnny, what's the matter?
This is Erika. How you talk to me!

996
01:11:13,610 --> 01:11:17,697
Lieutenant, it should not be
too difficult to grasp the situation.

997
01:11:17,781 --> 01:11:20,200
I wonder how he got through officers school.

998
01:11:21,367 --> 01:11:23,453
Oh, someone is with you, is that it?

999
01:11:23,536 --> 01:11:25,789
That is correct, Lieutenant Forrestal.

1000
01:11:25,872 --> 01:11:29,334
Is this the son of the secretary of the Navy?
Let me speak with him.

1001
01:11:29,417 --> 01:11:33,338
No, this is the army Forrestal,
absolutely no relation.

1002
01:11:34,214 --> 01:11:38,134
Lieutenant, I assure you
I'll see you as soon as it's practical.

1003
01:11:38,218 --> 01:11:41,137
It may be late,
possibly after your office hours.

1004
01:11:42,055 --> 01:11:47,060
- I miss you so, Johnny. I love you.
- I'll make a note of that.

1005
01:11:47,143 --> 01:11:49,187
Goodbye, Lieutenant.

1006
01:11:49,229 --> 01:11:52,524
Nice kid. We went through
basic training together.

1007
01:11:54,150 --> 01:11:56,277
Now, what am I to do about the Colonel?

1008
01:11:56,319 --> 01:12:00,073
- I don't know.
- Could he be transferred to Japan?

1009
01:12:00,156 --> 01:12:04,077
I don't think so, not Japan.
Not with Tokyo Rose around.

1010
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:07,205
- What do you suggest?
- What do I suggest?

1011
01:12:07,247 --> 01:12:10,166
- What do I suggest? Come on!
- Where are you taking me?

1012
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:12,919
Brent, take over for me.
I won't be back today.

1013
01:12:12,919 --> 01:12:16,089
Where are you taking me?
We have a meeting with the general.

1014
01:12:16,172 --> 01:12:19,884
You don't want to see the general,
you want to see me. I want to see you.

1015
01:12:19,926 --> 01:12:23,221
So little time, so much to say.
Don't let's waste a minute.

1016
01:12:23,263 --> 01:12:26,182
- My investigation...
- I'll handle it after you go.

1017
01:12:26,224 --> 01:12:28,935
Send you a full report to Washington.

1018
01:12:28,977 --> 01:12:32,230
These few days are ours.
They're all we've got.

1019
01:12:32,272 --> 01:12:34,107
You dreadful man.

1020
01:12:34,190 --> 01:12:36,985
Come on. Let's get the Jeep
and drive out to Wannsee.

1021
01:12:37,068 --> 01:12:42,323
It's wide and green and I know a spot
that looks like a bend in the Mississippi.

1022
01:12:42,407 --> 01:12:44,033
Let's.

1023
01:12:48,705 --> 01:12:52,041
(Brakes screech, horn honks)

1024
01:13:01,885 --> 01:13:04,679
Johnny, come on.

1025
01:13:04,721 --> 01:13:07,474
- Faster. Faster.
- Hi.

1026
01:13:07,557 --> 01:13:12,270
Two days and two nights, what has
mein kleiner Liebling being doing?

1027
01:13:13,271 --> 01:13:16,191
He's been making charm
with the bloodhounds.

1028
01:13:16,232 --> 01:13:18,568
How are things going
with the Congresswoman?

1029
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:21,613
- All right. We're engaged.
- You're what?

1030
01:13:21,654 --> 01:13:24,115
Better than having my head chopped off.

1031
01:13:24,157 --> 01:13:28,203
- I didn't know you were that deep in.
- What deep? How deep?

1032
01:13:28,286 --> 01:13:31,122
Why didn't you tell me
you and Birgel were like that?

1033
01:13:31,164 --> 01:13:33,917
- He's dead.
- Having your hand kissed by Hitler.

1034
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,835
I hope you had it sterilised.

1035
01:13:35,919 --> 01:13:38,630
Looked as if he had rat poison
in that moustache.

1036
01:13:38,713 --> 01:13:40,548
Don't talk like that.

1037
01:13:41,424 --> 01:13:45,136
Why not?
How much of a Nazi were you, anyway?

1038
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:48,473
Johnny, what does it matter,
a woman's politics?

1039
01:13:48,515 --> 01:13:52,811
Women pick out whatever's in fashion
and change it like a spring hat.

1040
01:13:52,852 --> 01:13:57,899
Yeah. Last year it was
a little number with a swastika on it.

1041
01:13:57,941 --> 01:14:01,903
This year it's ostrich feathers,
red, white and blue.

1042
01:14:01,945 --> 01:14:04,447
Next year a hammer, maybe, and a sickle.

1043
01:14:05,281 --> 01:14:09,452
Oh, Johnny, we must not say
mean words to each other.

1044
01:14:10,453 --> 01:14:14,749
When you say you are engaged,
that is only until her plane leaves, huh?

1045
01:14:14,791 --> 01:14:16,876
What else?

1046
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:19,379
- I love you so very much.
- You do?

1047
01:14:19,462 --> 01:14:22,257
You're the only man I ever wanted to marry.

1048
01:14:24,551 --> 01:14:26,594
That's mighty white of you.

1049
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:32,267
I want to go with you to America.
I want to climb up the Statue of Liberty.

1050
01:14:32,308 --> 01:14:35,478
You want to get down
that basement at Fort Knox.

1051
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,981
I want to be where you are.

1052
01:14:38,064 --> 01:14:42,318
Yeah, I can just imagine you
in Iowa in blue jeans,

1053
01:14:42,402 --> 01:14:44,654
going on a hay ride to the old mill.

1054
01:14:44,738 --> 01:14:46,781
I would love that.

1055
01:14:48,074 --> 01:14:51,161
Mmm, gently, baby, it's Mother's Day.

1056
01:14:52,662 --> 01:14:55,081
Cut it out, you blonde flamethrower.

1057
01:14:55,999 --> 01:14:57,459
Cut it out, I said.

1058
01:15:02,172 --> 01:15:04,841
Did you ever kiss the Congresswoman?

1059
01:15:04,841 --> 01:15:06,718
Sure I did.

1060
01:15:07,677 --> 01:15:11,181
- Did she kiss you?
- What kind of a question is that?

1061
01:15:11,222 --> 01:15:16,269
It's a very important question. What
do you do when you're alone together?

1062
01:15:16,311 --> 01:15:21,691
Oh... we sit, hold hands...

1063
01:15:23,109 --> 01:15:26,738
- whistle Shine On Harvest Moon.
- (Laughs)

1064
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:29,449
- What's so funny?
- You hold hands?

1065
01:15:29,532 --> 01:15:31,618
Sure. Nice people do, you know.

1066
01:15:33,703 --> 01:15:36,790
You're so naive, you Americans.

1067
01:15:36,873 --> 01:15:39,125
So we are. So what of it?

1068
01:15:39,209 --> 01:15:44,214
That funny little woman with a face
like a scrubbed kitchen floor.

1069
01:15:44,297 --> 01:15:46,132
Yeah?

1070
01:15:50,053 --> 01:15:53,973
I have some vodka from the Russian sector
and I had the phonograph fixed.

1071
01:15:54,057 --> 01:15:56,851
- Would you like to hear some music?
- No thanks.

1072
01:15:56,893 --> 01:15:59,562
- Thanks a lot but no thanks.
- You're going?

1073
01:15:59,646 --> 01:16:03,775
- I got an early formation.
- You'll come back tomorrow night?

1074
01:16:03,817 --> 01:16:06,736
I imagine so, sterling character that I am.

1075
01:16:07,654 --> 01:16:09,489
So long.

1076
01:16:11,658 --> 01:16:15,703
([Music:] Pringle whistling
Shine On Harvest Moon)

1077
01:16:26,756 --> 01:16:29,467
- Miss Frost?
- Miss Frost?

1078
01:16:30,510 --> 01:16:33,805
- We're waiting for you.
- Dinner, Miss Frost.

1079
01:16:33,847 --> 01:16:36,516
- Did you call me?
- It's a quarter of eight.

1080
01:16:36,599 --> 01:16:39,269
We're going to the officers' mess for dinner.

1081
01:16:39,269 --> 01:16:42,105
I was sort of planning on a quiet evening.

1082
01:16:42,188 --> 01:16:43,982
Don't you feel well, Miss Frost?

1083
01:16:44,023 --> 01:16:47,318
I feel fine.
I have a kind of a headache, that's all.

1084
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:49,654
Would you make
my excuses to the colonel?

1085
01:16:49,696 --> 01:16:52,615
- Sure will.
- Shall we bring you a sandwich maybe?

1086
01:16:52,699 --> 01:16:54,743
Cheese? Chicken? Ham?

1087
01:16:54,784 --> 01:16:58,830
Anything. Thank you very much.
Good evening, gentlemen.

1088
01:16:58,872 --> 01:17:00,915
Maybe we shouldn't leave her alone.

1089
01:17:00,957 --> 01:17:05,170
Maybe we should take her temperature.
Quite a lot of typhoid fever in Berlin.

1090
01:17:09,132 --> 01:17:12,469
Oh, good evening. I came to see Miss Frost.

1091
01:17:12,552 --> 01:17:14,596
Go on in. We're going out.

1092
01:17:15,805 --> 01:17:18,808
One might suspect
Cupid had a hand in this.

1093
01:17:18,892 --> 01:17:22,812
If we didn't know Miss Frost.
You can't shoot an arrow through steel.

1094
01:17:24,064 --> 01:17:26,441
Phoebe... Phoebe!

1095
01:17:27,734 --> 01:17:31,279
([Music:] Whistling Shine On Harvest Moon)

1096
01:17:35,909 --> 01:17:37,911
Coming, John.

1097
01:17:59,099 --> 01:18:01,309
(Whistles appreciatively)

1098
01:18:04,771 --> 01:18:06,648
Well!

1099
01:18:09,275 --> 01:18:12,112
- Do I look all right?
- Where did you get it?

1100
01:18:12,195 --> 01:18:15,907
- At the Brandenburg Gate.
- The black market? You didn't.

1101
01:18:15,949 --> 01:18:20,245
Well, I did. All I wanted was a lipstick
and something for my eyebrows

1102
01:18:20,286 --> 01:18:23,415
but a woman had this over
the handlebars of her bicycle

1103
01:18:23,456 --> 01:18:25,917
and I gave her my typewriter for it.

1104
01:18:25,959 --> 01:18:28,628
The shoes were six extra typewriter ribbons.

1105
01:18:28,711 --> 01:18:31,381
- Phoebe, for the love of Mike.
- Don't scold me.

1106
01:18:31,381 --> 01:18:33,842
I know I shouldn't have but I simply had to.

1107
01:18:33,883 --> 01:18:38,930
This is our last evening and I wanted
to look so pretty and I look just awful.

1108
01:18:38,972 --> 01:18:44,018
It's like a circus tent in mourning
for an elephant that died.

1109
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:46,896
- It's no such thing.
- I'm not blind.

1110
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:50,900
I tried to fix it but maybe
I'd better go up and put my suit on.

1111
01:18:51,818 --> 01:18:55,989
It is kind of high. What is it,
a turtleneck evening gown?

1112
01:18:56,072 --> 01:19:00,201
Well, it was a little lower but I fixed it.

1113
01:19:00,243 --> 01:19:02,287
You sure did.

1114
01:19:02,328 --> 01:19:06,624
Now, we takes this pin from here,
where it's just in the way,

1115
01:19:06,666 --> 01:19:09,753
and put it back here
where it can earn its pay.

1116
01:19:09,836 --> 01:19:11,880
It looked so lovely on the bicycle.

1117
01:19:11,921 --> 01:19:15,884
Now, stop it. You dressed for me
and to me you look good.

1118
01:19:15,925 --> 01:19:19,679
John, where did you learn
so much about women's clothes?

1119
01:19:19,763 --> 01:19:22,182
My mother wore women's clothes.

1120
01:19:22,265 --> 01:19:26,686
Oh, John, you're simply adorable.
Do you know it?

1121
01:19:26,770 --> 01:19:29,481
Who am I to argue with a Congresswoman?

1122
01:19:29,522 --> 01:19:31,816
You've got too much junk on your mouth.

1123
01:19:31,858 --> 01:19:33,943
- Have I?
- Now, hold still.

1124
01:19:36,362 --> 01:19:38,406
Now... we're in business.

1125
01:19:40,533 --> 01:19:42,494
We forgot your sable.

1126
01:19:42,535 --> 01:19:43,995
Oh...

1127
01:19:47,290 --> 01:19:50,335
You'll be quite a thing at that officers' mess.

1128
01:19:50,376 --> 01:19:53,505
- I don't want to go there.
- Where do you want to eat?

1129
01:19:53,546 --> 01:19:55,632
I thought some civilian place.

1130
01:19:55,715 --> 01:19:57,133
In Berlin?

1131
01:19:57,217 --> 01:20:01,137
The place where that singer...
You know, that place.

1132
01:20:01,221 --> 01:20:03,681
- You don't want to go to that sewer.
- Yes, I do.

1133
01:20:03,723 --> 01:20:06,393
I want it dark and gay and with music.

01:21:15,628 --> 01:21:19,591
[Music:] Take my lovely illusions

1149
01:21:19,632 --> 01:21:22,093
[Music:] Some for laughs

1150
01:21:23,386 --> 01:21:28,433
[Music:] Some for tears [Music:]

1151
01:21:35,398 --> 01:21:38,902
- Look, it's a hollow bottle.
- That's where the profit is.

1152
01:21:38,985 --> 01:21:41,654
There should be
a Congressional investigation.

1153
01:21:41,654 --> 01:21:45,200
- Second the motion.
- Let's investigate another bottle first.

1154
01:21:45,241 --> 01:21:47,243
- More champagne.
- Jawohl.

1155
01:21:48,078 --> 01:21:50,121
Hold my hand, John.

1156
01:21:51,414 --> 01:21:53,291
Sure.

1157
01:21:54,334 --> 01:21:56,711
Oh, John...

1158
01:21:56,753 --> 01:21:58,797
I'm so happy, I'm in heaven.

1159
01:22:00,006 --> 01:22:02,217
Not that I was unhappy before.

1160
01:22:02,258 --> 01:22:04,219
I was just drifting.

1161
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:08,306
That's it. Drifting on a grey sea all alone.

1162
01:22:08,348 --> 01:22:10,809
It's not bad but suddenly you get scared.

1163
01:22:10,850 --> 01:22:15,688
You need another voice,
so you hoist up your heart and you wait

1164
01:22:15,772 --> 01:22:19,025
and nobody passes by, just grey waves.

1165
01:22:19,109 --> 01:22:23,655
Your heart gets frayed,
lashed by the night winds and rain.

1166
01:22:23,696 --> 01:22:28,368
So you haul it down, what's left of it,
and you resign yourself...

1167
01:22:29,369 --> 01:22:33,123
Then suddenly out of nowhere
comes a boat so unexpected,

1168
01:22:33,206 --> 01:22:35,917
all white sails on the horizon.

1169
01:22:35,959 --> 01:22:38,420
To you, my beautiful boat.

1170
01:22:39,963 --> 01:22:42,215
Phoebe, you make me feel awful.

1171
01:22:42,298 --> 01:22:46,302
Well, you are beautiful and you're fun
and you're good to me.

1172
01:22:46,386 --> 01:22:49,848
Stop it. I'm not that good.
Some day you may find...

1173
01:22:49,889 --> 01:22:52,016
You talk an awful lot for a boat.

1174
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:55,395
To us.

1175
01:22:59,816 --> 01:23:01,860
([Music:] Vocalising)

1176
01:23:09,242 --> 01:23:14,873
[Music:] Want to buy some illusions slightly used?

1177
01:23:14,914 --> 01:23:18,209
[Music:] Just like new

1178
01:23:18,251 --> 01:23:21,671
[Music:] Such romantic illusions

1179
01:23:21,755 --> 01:23:26,384
[Music:] And they're all about you

1180
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:31,890
[Music:] I'd sell them all for a penny

1181
01:23:31,931 --> 01:23:35,894
[Music:] They make pretty souvenirs

1182
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:40,982
[Music:] Take my lovely illusions

1183
01:23:41,024 --> 01:23:43,318
[Music:] Some for love

1184
01:23:44,277 --> 01:23:50,116
[Music:] Some for tears [Music:]

1185
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,243
(Cheering and applause)

1186
01:23:55,455 --> 01:23:57,499
- Good evening.
- May I?

1187
01:23:58,875 --> 01:24:01,669
- Get another glass, John.
- No thank you.

1188
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:06,132
My, look at the kitchen floor.

1189
01:24:07,634 --> 01:24:10,637
- Look at what?
- Such a change.

1190
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:14,307
This dress. This dress is from Iowa?

1191
01:24:14,391 --> 01:24:16,726
Oh, no, Berlin. Do you like it?

1192
01:24:17,477 --> 01:24:21,731
It's stunning but haven't you
got it on backwards? And the hair.

1193
01:24:22,816 --> 01:24:25,485
What did you put in
those pigtails, shoelaces?

1194
01:24:25,485 --> 01:24:28,405
- I like it.
- He likes it.

1195
01:24:28,488 --> 01:24:32,867
I shouldn't have mentioned the eyebrows.
Now her face looks bow-legged.

1196
01:24:32,909 --> 01:24:36,663
Miss von Schlütow, I think
the pianist is looking for you.

1197
01:24:36,746 --> 01:24:39,999
Have you ever made any progress
hunting down that man?

1198
01:24:40,083 --> 01:24:42,127
- What man?
- My man.

1199
01:24:42,168 --> 01:24:43,878
Oh.

1200
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:49,175
Oh, a little progress, only that's all been
postponed on account of another man.

1201
01:24:49,259 --> 01:24:52,220
Look at him. Isn't he beautiful?

1202
01:24:52,262 --> 01:24:55,223
Phoebe, please.
She always kids me like that.

1203
01:24:55,265 --> 01:25:00,061
- I know he's not pretty but he's beautiful.
- When are you leaving Berlin?

1204
01:25:00,103 --> 01:25:03,148
- Tomorrow. It's our last night together.
- Too bad.

1205
01:25:03,189 --> 01:25:05,942
What he doesn't know is he's going too.

1206
01:25:06,025 --> 01:25:08,445
- I am?
- I talked it over with the general.

1207
01:25:08,528 --> 01:25:11,322
- It was to be a surprise.
- It is.

1208
01:25:11,364 --> 01:25:13,450
- I can't go.
- Yes, you can.

1209
01:25:13,533 --> 01:25:16,202
He hasn't had a furlough in four years.

1210
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:21,750
This is a bolt from the blue.
I didn't have the slightest, faintest...

1211
01:25:21,791 --> 01:25:25,086
Miss von Schlütow,
isn't it time for your next number?

1212
01:25:25,128 --> 01:25:27,881
There'll be no next number tonight.

1213
01:25:27,964 --> 01:25:30,759
May I steal
one of your American cigarettes?

1214
01:25:46,983 --> 01:25:50,070
Hey, Pringle.
John, the Colonel's looking for you.

1215
01:25:50,904 --> 01:25:52,781
- Colonel?
- Yelling his head off.

1216
01:25:52,822 --> 01:25:55,492
He's got enough blood
in his eye to sell by the pint.

1217
01:25:55,575 --> 01:25:59,120
- What does he want?
- I don't know. Get down to his office.

1218
01:26:00,830 --> 01:26:02,957
Check! Check! Er... (Speaks German)

1219
01:26:02,999 --> 01:26:05,460
Go on. I'll take care of the check. Hurry.

1220
01:26:05,502 --> 01:26:09,672
- I'll drop you on the way.
- I'll take Miss Frost home. Get going.

1221
01:26:09,756 --> 01:26:12,175
Why are you going? It's so nice here.

1222
01:26:12,258 --> 01:26:15,261
- I got to go. Didn't you hear?
- I forbid you.

1223
01:26:15,345 --> 01:26:18,056
- Phoebe, this is the army.
- I don't want you to go.

1224
01:26:18,098 --> 01:26:19,724
I got to go.

1225
01:26:19,766 --> 01:26:23,061
All right. You're in contempt of Congress.

1226
01:26:24,104 --> 01:26:26,564
Take care of our friend. Goodbye.

1227
01:26:26,606 --> 01:26:28,691
Goodbye, Fräulein von Schlütow.

1228
01:26:31,277 --> 01:26:33,947
- How much?
- No, this is on the house.

1229
01:26:33,947 --> 01:26:37,700
- Thank you. Ready, Miss Frost?
- Sit down. Have some champagne.

1230
01:26:37,784 --> 01:26:40,787
Another bottle. (Speaking German)

1231
01:26:40,870 --> 01:26:42,872
Sit down.

1232
01:26:45,792 --> 01:26:50,046
No, I really shouldn't be in a place like this.

1233
01:26:50,130 --> 01:26:51,548
(Hiccups)

1234
01:26:51,631 --> 01:26:53,883
(All yelling "Hey" in time
with Russian Cossack music)

1235
01:27:22,245 --> 01:27:24,706
- Ha!
- (All cheer)

1236
01:27:32,505 --> 01:27:36,259
[Music:] The stars at night are big and bright

1237
01:27:37,093 --> 01:27:39,179
[Music:] Deep in the heart of Texas

1238
01:27:40,096 --> 01:27:43,183
[Music:] The prairie sky is wide and high

1239
01:27:43,933 --> 01:27:46,936
- [Music:] Deep in the heart of Texas
- (Man) Yahoo!

1240
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:50,482
[Music:] The sage in bloom is like perfume

1241
01:27:50,523 --> 01:27:53,359
[Music:] Deep in the heart of Texas

1242
01:27:53,443 --> 01:27:56,946
[Music:] Reminds me of the one I love

1243
01:27:57,030 --> 01:27:59,449
[Music:] Deep in the heart of Texas [Music:]

1244
01:27:59,532 --> 01:28:01,576
(All cheering)

1245
01:28:02,452 --> 01:28:04,746
Don't suppose you boys
know the Iowa song?

1246
01:28:04,788 --> 01:28:07,832
- Iowa, where's that?
- In the United States, silly.

1247
01:28:07,874 --> 01:28:10,168
- Since when?
- 1846.

1248
01:28:10,210 --> 01:28:13,713
No kidding. (Hums)

1249
01:28:13,797 --> 01:28:16,049
(Frost hums, off-key)

1250
01:28:18,802 --> 01:28:23,056
- Would you like to play it?
- We'll play it but we don't like it.

1251
01:28:24,933 --> 01:28:27,352
- My old campaign song.
- Sing it.

1252
01:28:27,394 --> 01:28:29,479
- No.
- You must. You asked for it.

1253
01:28:29,562 --> 01:28:33,066
Maybe there's some boats around.
Who knows? Go on.

1254
01:28:33,983 --> 01:28:38,029
[Music:] Ioway, Ioway

1255
01:28:38,071 --> 01:28:41,616
[Music:] State of all the land, joy on every hand

1256
01:28:41,658 --> 01:28:46,329
[Music:] We are from Ioway, Ioway

1257
01:28:46,413 --> 01:28:49,916
[Music:] That's where the tall corn grows

1258
01:28:51,084 --> 01:28:54,838
[Music:] Fly away, Ioway

1259
01:28:54,921 --> 01:28:58,425
[Music:] State of all the land, joy on every hand

1260
01:28:58,508 --> 01:29:02,011
- [Music:] We are from Ioway... [Music:]
- (Speaking German)

1261
01:29:15,525 --> 01:29:19,946
[Music:] We are from Ioway, Ioway

1262
01:29:20,029 --> 01:29:22,741
[Music:] That's where the tall corn grows [Music:]

1263
01:29:22,824 --> 01:29:25,243
- Everybody, sing!
- (Cheering)

1264
01:29:25,285 --> 01:29:30,206
[Music:] We are from Ioway, Ioway

1265
01:29:30,290 --> 01:29:33,585
[Music:] State of all the land, joy on every hand

1266
01:29:33,626 --> 01:29:37,922
[Music:] We are from Ioway, Ioway

1267
01:29:37,964 --> 01:29:41,718
[Music:] That's where the tall corn grows [Music:]

1268
01:29:44,554 --> 01:29:47,390
(Yelling in Russian)

1269
01:29:58,068 --> 01:30:00,570
(Sirens outside)

1270
01:30:01,571 --> 01:30:05,867
This is a raid. All military personnel,
get out their papers.

1271
01:30:06,993 --> 01:30:10,038
(Official speaking German)

1272
01:30:11,414 --> 01:30:13,500
(Frost) Whoo-hoo!

1273
01:30:15,460 --> 01:30:18,088
Hey. Hey, you.

1274
01:30:19,130 --> 01:30:21,007
Who-hoo.

1275
01:30:21,091 --> 01:30:23,259
- Hey.
- (Speaking German)

1276
01:30:25,678 --> 01:30:27,263
Jawohl!

1277
01:30:27,347 --> 01:30:28,640
(Laughs)

1278
01:30:28,681 --> 01:30:31,142
- Oh, will you...
- (Speaking German)

1279
01:30:31,184 --> 01:30:33,353
Where are we going?

1280
01:30:34,479 --> 01:30:36,523
Pretty hat. Let me try it on.

1281
01:30:57,460 --> 01:31:01,005
What's this? What's happening?
Where are we going?

1282
01:31:01,965 --> 01:31:05,093
- To the police station. This is a raid.
- A what?

1283
01:31:05,135 --> 01:31:08,888
- A raid. We have one every other week.
- That's ridiculous.

1284
01:31:08,972 --> 01:31:10,807
They want to check up on our papers.

1285
01:31:10,890 --> 01:31:13,560
We Germans have to have
our papers in order.

1286
01:31:13,601 --> 01:31:16,020
But I'm not a German. They have no right...

1287
01:31:16,062 --> 01:31:20,358
Of course they haven't. There's
no reason why you should submit to it.

1288
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:25,155
You just tell them who you are and
they'll apologise and let you go home.

1289
01:31:25,238 --> 01:31:28,491
Only on second thoughts, is it a good idea?

1290
01:31:28,575 --> 01:31:32,078
What kind of an impression
will it make on us Germans?

1291
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:37,167
A Congresswoman of the United States
of America caught at the Lorelei.

1292
01:31:38,084 --> 01:31:41,588
And where did the Honourable
Miss Frost get that dress?

1293
01:31:41,671 --> 01:31:43,923
The black market, maybe?

1294
01:32:08,782 --> 01:32:11,910
- Want some coffee, Captain?
- No thanks, sir.

1295
01:32:11,993 --> 01:32:14,996
- Just as well. This is the only cup.
- Yes, sir.

1296
01:32:15,038 --> 01:32:18,166
How about a jigger of poison
with a hemlock chaser?

1297
01:32:18,249 --> 01:32:20,085
More like it, sir.

1298
01:32:21,127 --> 01:32:26,382
Captain, I think you have as good
a war record as any man in this town.

1299
01:32:26,466 --> 01:32:30,720
You were on the first team since Normandy
and you sure carried the ball.

1300
01:32:30,762 --> 01:32:35,809
I know you were among the first ten men
to cross the Remagen Bridge.

1301
01:32:35,892 --> 01:32:38,603
I also know why you were in such a hurry.

1302
01:32:39,813 --> 01:32:42,899
Did you know what a hot potato
you had on your hands?

1303
01:32:42,982 --> 01:32:48,321
Well, not quite, sir.
I... had a hunch it was warm, all right.

1304
01:32:48,321 --> 01:32:50,990
Sometimes I wonder
if it isn't a waste of money

1305
01:32:51,074 --> 01:32:55,328
to import 11,000 ping-pong tables
for the recreation of you young men.

1306
01:32:57,163 --> 01:32:59,124
Captain, you might as well realise

1307
01:32:59,165 --> 01:33:02,377
we've been wise to you
and the von Schlütow woman all along.

1308
01:33:02,419 --> 01:33:04,421
I kind of figured you were peeking.

1309
01:33:04,504 --> 01:33:08,216
The army has been counting on you
for a certain pattern of behaviour.

1310
01:33:08,299 --> 01:33:11,010
- You let us down but good.
- Sorry, sir.

1311
01:33:12,095 --> 01:33:15,598
Since that committee arrived,
you've been playing a double bill

1312
01:33:15,682 --> 01:33:17,851
with the lady from Iowa in the upper half.

1313
01:33:17,934 --> 01:33:20,937
I'd appreciate it
if you leave her out of this, sir.

1314
01:33:22,021 --> 01:33:23,857
You would?

1315
01:33:24,983 --> 01:33:29,738
Pressure has been exerted to have you
go back to the United States for a while.

1316
01:33:29,779 --> 01:33:32,532
- So I've heard.
- You're not going of course.

1317
01:33:32,615 --> 01:33:36,119
Of course. When do proceedings start, sir?

1318
01:33:37,203 --> 01:33:42,000
Captain Pringle, you're to stay away
from that certain party, off limits.

1319
01:33:42,041 --> 01:33:45,795
Suits me fine. It was all washed up
anyway as far as I'm concerned.

1320
01:33:45,837 --> 01:33:50,759
Let's get this straight. You're to stay
away from the Congresswoman.

1321
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:52,510
Oh?

1322
01:33:52,594 --> 01:33:55,055
Pick up that torch for
Fräulein von Schlütow,

1323
01:33:55,138 --> 01:33:58,141
light it again and carry it in public,
that's an order.

1324
01:33:59,142 --> 01:34:02,395
- Well, how do you do.
- You've heard of Hans Otto Birgel?

1325
01:34:02,479 --> 01:34:05,899
- That was her guy.
- He's hiding out in the American zone.

1326
01:34:05,982 --> 01:34:08,234
- He's dead.
- He's very much alive.

1327
01:34:08,318 --> 01:34:10,320
And thanks to you, he's kicking.

1328
01:34:10,403 --> 01:34:13,656
We had a hunch about him
so we watched Miss von Schlütow.

1329
01:34:13,740 --> 01:34:15,825
Here are three letters we intercepted.

1330
01:34:15,909 --> 01:34:20,705
Someone tipped him off that his girl
has been seeing an American officer.

1331
01:34:20,747 --> 01:34:24,459
He's a jealous rat. He says he's going
to come out and kill you both.

1332
01:34:25,502 --> 01:34:29,255
- That's cute.
- Now, go on back and fan those flames.

1333
01:34:29,339 --> 01:34:32,258
Stick around the Fräulein until he shows.

1334
01:34:32,342 --> 01:34:35,011
I wish I'd never crossed
the Remagen Bridge.

1335
01:34:35,011 --> 01:34:37,514
Sorry, son, that's the way it reads.

1336
01:34:37,597 --> 01:34:41,726
OK, I'm going.
Only I think I'll have that coffee first.

1337
01:34:41,768 --> 01:34:45,522
Never mind the cup.
Just give me a spoonful of the powder.

1338
01:34:47,273 --> 01:34:49,651
(Speaking German)

1339
01:35:08,461 --> 01:35:11,589
- Do you have your passport with you?
- No.

1340
01:35:11,631 --> 01:35:15,802
You just tell them who you are
and they check with the army officials.

1341
01:35:15,885 --> 01:35:18,555
- I can't do that.
- Why?

1342
01:35:18,555 --> 01:35:23,226
What if the German papers pick it up
and there are some ugly references?

1343
01:35:23,309 --> 01:35:25,353
May never reach Washington.

1344
01:35:26,479 --> 01:35:31,234
Of course there's one person who could
get you out of all this nastiness.

1345
01:35:31,317 --> 01:35:33,570
Me. I could do it.

1346
01:35:34,529 --> 01:35:37,449
No names mentioned. No aftereffects.

1347
01:35:37,490 --> 01:35:39,576
Just as if it never happened.

1348
01:35:40,785 --> 01:35:43,413
Why should you? You don't like me.

1349
01:35:43,496 --> 01:35:47,417
It's not generosity. We Germans
can't afford to be generous.

1350
01:35:47,500 --> 01:35:49,544
We're very poor.

1351
01:35:49,586 --> 01:35:52,255
It's give and take if we are to survive.

1352
01:35:53,298 --> 01:35:55,717
What have I to give?

1353
01:35:55,759 --> 01:35:59,679
- What do you want to take?
- (Officer yelling in German)

1354

(Speaking German)

1355
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:36,591
(Speaking German)

1356
01:37:04,202 --> 01:37:08,456
You know what I told him?
That you were a country cousin of mine.

1357
01:37:08,498 --> 01:37:10,959
Perfectly easy if you have a safe conduct

1358
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,295
with the signature of
a kind American officer on it.

1359
01:37:14,379 --> 01:37:16,798
And you wanted to chop his head off.

1360
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:20,218
Exactly what is it you want from me,
Fräulein von Schlütow?

1361
01:37:20,260 --> 01:37:23,805
Let's go up to my apartment.
It's only a few ruins away from here.

1362
01:37:23,847 --> 01:37:26,516
- No, I'd rather not.
- You'd better.

1363
01:37:26,599 --> 01:37:28,643
You may need a handkerchief.

1364
01:37:32,689 --> 01:37:36,943
This is a beastly thing to do but you must
understand what happened to us here.

1365
01:37:37,026 --> 01:37:40,280
We all become animals
with exactly one instinct left.

1366
01:37:40,363 --> 01:37:42,198
Self-preservation.

1367
01:37:42,282 --> 01:37:45,535
Take me, Miss Frost.
Bombed out a dozen times.

1368
01:37:45,618 --> 01:37:48,329
Everything caved in
and pulled out from under me.

1369
01:37:48,371 --> 01:37:51,416
My country, my possessions, my beliefs.

1370
01:37:51,458 --> 01:37:53,543
Yet somehow I kept going.

1371
01:37:53,626 --> 01:37:58,006
Months in air-raid shelters
crammed in with 5,000 other people.

1372
01:37:58,047 --> 01:37:59,924
I kept going.

1373
01:38:00,008 --> 01:38:04,637
What do you think it was like to be a woman
here when the Russians swept in?

1374
01:38:04,721 --> 01:38:06,973
I kept going.

1375
01:38:07,057 --> 01:38:10,143
It was a living hell... and then I found a man.

1376
01:38:10,226 --> 01:38:13,730
And through that man,
a roof and a job and food and...

1377
01:38:15,065 --> 01:38:17,358
And I'm not going to lose him.

1378
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:19,486
What has all this to do with me?

1379
01:38:19,569 --> 01:38:22,822
A little. You see, you want the same man.

1380
01:38:24,574 --> 01:38:28,495
Come on. I told you
you'd need a handkerchief.

([Music:] Whistling Shine On Harvest Moon)

1382
01:38:55,939 --> 01:38:59,275
This is how he looked when I met him first.
He was a lieutenant.

1383
01:38:59,359 --> 01:39:02,028
He sat at his desk interrogating me.

1384
01:39:02,028 --> 01:39:05,323
He had such a grim, businesslike face,

1385
01:39:05,365 --> 01:39:09,661
but fortunately I was wearing
my last pair of silk stockings.

1386
01:39:10,703 --> 01:39:12,956
He's really a nice boy.

1387
01:39:13,039 --> 01:39:15,708
You mustn't judge him
by what he did to you.

1388
01:39:16,459 --> 01:39:18,336
He hated it. I know.

1389
01:39:18,378 --> 01:39:23,049
Of course, he would come here
and feel so miserable and sorry for you.

1390
01:39:23,133 --> 01:39:26,010
Your plane is leaving tomorrow, isn't it?

1391
01:39:28,638 --> 01:39:33,643
Don't sit there as if it was the end
of the world. Nothing happened.

1392
01:39:33,727 --> 01:39:36,438
He played a dirty trick on you, that's all.

1393
01:39:37,313 --> 01:39:41,609
So you fly off back home,
wash your hands, wash your lips...

1394
01:39:42,652 --> 01:39:45,780
They've got so much soap
in the United States.

1395
01:39:47,407 --> 01:39:50,368
Sorry. You know this game of love.

1396
01:39:50,410 --> 01:39:53,246
If you want to take
the advice of an old gambler,

1397
01:39:53,329 --> 01:39:56,666
some people are lucky at it,
some people are jinxed.

1398
01:39:57,584 --> 01:40:00,378
They shouldn't even sit down at the table.

1399
01:40:01,421 --> 01:40:03,506
(Car horn honks)

1400
01:40:08,011 --> 01:40:10,263
I do not imagine you care to see him again.

1401
01:40:10,346 --> 01:40:14,476
Why not go up the stairs where it's dark
until he comes in and then leave?

1402
01:40:15,268 --> 01:40:18,104
(Car horn honks)

1403
01:40:18,188 --> 01:40:20,857
Go on, leave. Haven't you had enough?

1404
01:40:24,694 --> 01:40:26,780
What is this, a big scene?

1405
01:40:26,863 --> 01:40:30,575
We can't keep a gentleman
in the dark, can we?

1406
01:40:30,617 --> 01:40:33,912
Four hours ago you could
have had him court-martialled

1407
01:40:33,953 --> 01:40:36,998
and sent me to a labour camp, not now.

1408
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:40,085
Not any more. Now you're one of us.

1409
01:40:52,305 --> 01:40:54,182
Hi.

1410
01:41:01,898 --> 01:41:05,193
What's the matter?
No kiss for your little Schweinehund?

1411
01:41:06,986 --> 01:41:11,032
I'm sorry I had to show up with that
Congress dame. She's gone dappy.

1412
01:41:11,074 --> 01:41:14,619
Doesn't mean a thing.
Leaving tomorrow anyway.

1413
01:41:14,661 --> 01:41:16,538
Come on.

1414
01:41:40,687 --> 01:41:42,564
Sorry.

1415
01:41:45,358 --> 01:41:49,654
I guess this is where the funny man says,
"Shall we dance?"

1416
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:52,365
You are not a funny man, Captain Pringle.

1417
01:41:53,366 --> 01:41:55,785
But you are quite a dancer.

1418
01:41:55,869 --> 01:41:57,912
What a waltz we had.

1419
01:41:58,955 --> 01:42:00,790
Good night.

one of these, it lasted 11 days.

You're a great comfort.

1428
01:43:51,985 --> 01:43:57,031
You can't get to Washington soon enough,
can you, to dash off that black Berlin report?

1429
01:43:57,073 --> 01:43:59,534
No report at all, Colonel Plummer.

1430
01:43:59,576 --> 01:44:03,538
- No?
- I came here as an objective observer.

1431
01:44:03,580 --> 01:44:07,333
Some things have happened
which automatically disqualify me.

1432

Aren't you taking it a little big?

- You know nothing whatever about it.
- I got a hunch.

1434

In a way, I'm glad you took off the blinkers
and wandered away on your own.

1435
01:44:16,926 --> 01:44:20,680
It's a big mess we're trying to clean up.
There's a lot of rubble.

Rubble of all kinds,
vegetable, mineral and animal.

1437

(Plummer) I'm sorry but I feel a little
responsible about that loose brick, Pringle.

1440
01:44:36,613 --> 01:44:39,908
- Colonel, please.
- I'm not trying to whitewash him.

1441
01:44:39,949 --> 01:44:42,410
There isn't enough paint in Germany for that

1442
01:44:42,452 --> 01:44:45,413
but let me scrape together
something in his defence.

1443
01:44:45,455 --> 01:44:47,916
- I'm not listening.
- Take it from me.

1444
01:44:47,957 --> 01:44:50,043
He won't get off scot-free.

1445
01:44:50,126 --> 01:44:53,129
As a matter of fact,
he's started to pay already.

1446

It's no fun to walk around
with a target pinned on your chest.

I'd appreciate it if you'd leave me alone.

for the plane?

Those aren't teardrops. I was washing my
hands when he asked me to give it to you.

All right, I'll put it right there.

Colonel Plummer, it's clearing. We should
be taking off in about 20 minutes.

01:47:34,791 --> 01:47:39,003
[Music:] Trees are in bloom
as they have never been

1470
01:47:39,045 --> 01:47:43,133
[Music:] Sometimes at night
you feel in all your sorrow

1471
01:47:43,216 --> 01:47:47,178
[Music:] Her perfume as of a sweet tomorrow

1472
01:47:47,220 --> 01:47:51,391
[Music:] That's when you realise at last

1473
01:47:51,474 --> 01:47:55,395
[Music:] They won't return
the phantoms of the past

1474
01:47:55,478 --> 01:47:59,482
[Music:] A brand new spring is to begin

1475
01:47:59,566 --> 01:48:03,486
[Music:] Out of the ruins of Berlin [Music:]

1476
01:48:07,907 --> 01:48:11,035
([Music:] Singing in German)

1477
01:48:26,176 --> 01:48:29,637
([Music:] Singing in French)

1478
01:48:34,851 --> 01:48:38,229
([Music:] Singing in Russian)

1479
01:48:47,614 --> 01:48:50,950
([Music:] Singing in German)

1480
01:49:08,301 --> 01:49:10,970
([Music:] Singing in French)

1481
01:49:17,977 --> 01:49:20,522
([Music:] Singing in Russian)

1482
01:49:27,070 --> 01:49:29,864
(Cheering and applause)

1483
01:49:32,158 --> 01:49:34,911
(Gunshots, screaming)

1484
01:49:38,998 --> 01:49:43,336
So we followed her all day
until the five o'clock shadow showed.

1485
01:49:43,420 --> 01:49:46,131
- Sure enough, she was Hermann.
- Well, doggone.

1486
01:49:46,172 --> 01:49:48,258
You sure spin some tall tales.

1487
01:49:48,341 --> 01:49:51,594
Yeah, well, how about this?
Hans Otto Birgel.

1488
01:49:51,678 --> 01:49:54,097
Big Gestapo man hiding out underground.

1489
01:49:54,180 --> 01:49:58,435
The only lead we have is that
he's still crazy about a former lady friend,

1490
01:49:58,518 --> 01:50:01,479
a nightclub singer
somewhere in the American sector.

1491
01:50:02,772 --> 01:50:06,484
Herr Birgel suspects she's two-timing him
so he crawls out of his hole.

1492
01:50:06,526 --> 01:50:08,737
Only he doesn't crawl fast enough.

1493
01:50:08,778 --> 01:50:12,073
So we play it up a little
with the help of an American officer.

1494
01:50:12,115 --> 01:50:13,992
A captain, to be exact.

1495
01:50:14,033 --> 01:50:17,620
Make a fancy story in
a Sunday supplement someday.

1496
01:50:17,704 --> 01:50:21,082
- The Love Commando.
- (Woman) Ha.

1497
01:50:21,124 --> 01:50:25,086
Here's their angle. The Captain
isn't very keen for the assignment,

1498
01:50:25,128 --> 01:50:28,423
having fallen for
somebody else in the meantime.

1499
01:50:28,465 --> 01:50:31,718
You know how they cook it up
with a lot of marshmallow on top.

1500
01:50:31,801 --> 01:50:35,055
Then the story of how
they got the poison into Göring's cell.

1501
01:50:35,138 --> 01:50:38,016
- (Whistles blowing)
- There were two scrub women...

1502
01:50:40,060 --> 01:50:44,189
Sorry, sir. The car has to pull in.
Keeping the street open for the ambulance.

1503
01:50:44,230 --> 01:50:46,524
- What's up?
- Trouble at the Lorelei.

1504
01:50:46,566 --> 01:50:49,903
- Birgel showed up. There was shooting.
- (Plummer) Who got it?

1505
01:50:49,986 --> 01:50:52,989
- I don't know, sir.
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

1506
01:50:53,073 --> 01:50:55,784
Perhaps you'd want
to come along, Miss Frost.

1507
01:50:58,995 --> 01:51:00,288
Hey!

1508
01:51:00,330 --> 01:51:03,291
([Music:] Singing drunkenly in Russian)

1509
01:51:51,297 --> 01:51:55,051
Mm-hm. Two plugs right through the kisser.

1510
01:51:55,885 --> 01:51:57,011
No.

1511
01:51:58,888 --> 01:52:02,392
- It was an ugly kisser anyway.
- It was not.

1512
01:52:02,475 --> 01:52:05,562
He was no good
and he's dead and it's OK by me.

1513
01:52:05,645 --> 01:52:07,147
Ohh...

1514
01:52:07,230 --> 01:52:09,232
No sense of humour.

1515
01:52:09,315 --> 01:52:11,359
Take care of her, lover boy.

1516
01:52:16,823 --> 01:52:18,908
(Humming mournfully)

1517
01:52:20,160 --> 01:52:22,454
- All right, clean up the mess.
- Yes, sir.

1518
01:52:22,495 --> 01:52:27,167
Find him a slab before the Russkies
start tossing him up to the ceiling.

1519
01:52:31,337 --> 01:52:33,214
Go on home!

1520
01:52:33,256 --> 01:52:36,009
Come on, break it up, let's go. All right.

1521
01:52:36,092 --> 01:52:38,136
(Humming stops)

1522
01:52:39,763 --> 01:52:41,431
Where are you taking me?

1523
01:52:41,514 --> 01:52:45,435
Looks like you've got a date
with five million von bricks.

1524
01:52:45,518 --> 01:52:47,687
I have a paper saying I'm on the white list.

1525
01:52:47,771 --> 01:52:49,814
We know how you got it and it wasn't,

1526
01:52:49,856 --> 01:52:52,901
if you'll pardon
the non-Aryan expression, kosher.

1527
01:52:52,942 --> 01:52:55,153
You do not understand. There's a mix-up.

1528
01:52:55,195 --> 01:52:58,239
Yeah. We just sent part of it
off to the morgue.

1529
01:52:58,281 --> 01:53:01,367
- Just ask Captain Pringle.
- Forget Captain Pringle.

1530
01:53:01,451 --> 01:53:06,081
How could I ever forget him?
He's so nice. I will miss him terribly.

1531
01:53:06,122 --> 01:53:08,208
- Please tell him.
- No soap.

1532
01:53:08,291 --> 01:53:10,794
And no chocolate, no cigarettes.

1533
01:53:10,877 --> 01:53:12,879
Tough.

1534
01:53:14,047 --> 01:53:18,593
Tell me, Colonel, are you
that wonderful Colonel Plummer?

1535
01:53:18,635 --> 01:53:23,139
That's me,
only most of the time they call me delicious.

1536
01:53:23,223 --> 01:53:27,435
Colonel, if I could come to your office
tomorrow sometime,

1537
01:53:27,477 --> 01:53:29,437
when you're not too busy.

1538
01:53:29,479 --> 01:53:33,441
Miss von Schlütow,
I've become a grandfather today.

1539
01:53:33,483 --> 01:53:35,318
Let's not be silly.

1540
01:53:36,152 --> 01:53:38,196
She's all yours.

1541
01:53:38,238 --> 01:53:40,990
Can they take me
by my apartment so I can change?

1542
01:53:41,074 --> 01:53:44,619
- I guess so.
- Come on, boys.

1543
01:53:45,995 --> 01:53:48,039
Has it stopped raining?

1544
01:53:48,081 --> 01:53:52,252
If there are any puddles,
you'll carry me, won't you, boys?

1545
01:54:01,845 --> 01:54:04,139
You two, watch out for those two.

1546
01:54:04,180 --> 01:54:06,224
(Both) Yes, sir.

1547
01:54:11,938 --> 01:54:15,191
- And you watch out for them.
- That ought to do it.

1548
01:54:25,201 --> 01:54:28,246
He said there were two plugs in your kisser.

1549
01:54:28,288 --> 01:54:31,583
There ought to be.
I'm sorry about everything.

1550
01:54:31,624 --> 01:54:34,377
- Except the time with you.
- Take that away.

1551
01:54:34,461 --> 01:54:38,465
It's true. With all the headaches ahead,
you'll be my aspirin.

1552
01:54:38,548 --> 01:54:40,800
That's nice, but what about my headache?

1553
01:54:40,884 --> 01:54:42,886
You're on your way back home.

1554
01:54:42,969 --> 01:54:46,681
You'll be all right by the time
you fasten your seat belt.

1555
01:54:46,723 --> 01:54:48,767
I love you, John.

1556
01:54:50,477 --> 01:54:53,980
No, you don't. I'm just a hit-and-run boy.

1557
01:54:54,064 --> 01:54:57,150
The kind of guy you need
is somebody to marry.

1558
01:54:57,233 --> 01:54:58,860
Well?

1559
01:54:58,902 --> 01:55:01,863
Oh, no. I'm not somebody anybody marries.

1560
01:55:02,989 --> 01:55:09,037
You need somebody respectable,
a senator, a Supreme Court judge,

1561
01:55:09,079 --> 01:55:13,124
maybe... somebody from
the Smithsonian Institute.

1562
01:55:13,166 --> 01:55:14,834
I know who I want.

1563
01:55:14,918 --> 01:55:17,629
Not me, I'm a heel, a certified heel.

1564
01:55:17,670 --> 01:55:20,340
I got documents to prove it.

1565
01:55:20,423 --> 01:55:22,675
Listen...

1566
01:55:22,759 --> 01:55:26,888
"Listen, my children, and you shall hear
of the midnight ride of Paul Revere

1567
01:55:26,930 --> 01:55:31,267
"On the 18th of April in '75, hardly a man
is now alive who remembers..."

1568
01:55:31,351 --> 01:55:33,395
(Glass smashing)

1569
01:55:34,104 --> 01:55:35,397
Oh...
