1
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,432
Water Drops on Burning Rocks

2
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,593
Come in.

3
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,669
Prost.

4
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,196
I don't know why I came with you.

5
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,393
I had a date.

6
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,030
How old are you?
No, let me guess. 19?

7
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,152
That's it. Well, 20 actually.

8
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,559
My birthday was one week
ago today.

9
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,876
Age doesn't matter to me.

10
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,593
- Really?
- No.

11
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,074
And me?

12
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,678
How old do you think I am?

13
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,313
I don't know, 50?

14
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,714
50!

15
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,552
No one's ever said that!

16
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,716
But that's it, isn't it?

17
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,119
Precisely.

18
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,115
I was supposed to meet
Anna tonight. She'll be mad.

19
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,239
It's weird,
I really wanted to see her.

20
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,994
What made you say 50?

21
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,676
You talk like people that age.

22
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,029
Really?

23
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,633
But physically,
don't I look younger?

24
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,673
Yeah, you look much younger
physically.

25
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,954
Maybe I'll go straight to Anna's.

26
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,350
Anna and I want to get married.

27
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,279
We need to find an apartment,
though.

28
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,799
I see.

29
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,553
Your place is nice.

30
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,151
I don't like it much.

31
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,316
I haven't really moved in yet.

32
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,997
Can you drive me back?
It's pretty far.

33
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,553
Naturally, when the time comes.

34
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,117
Are there other rooms?

35
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,479
A bedroom.

36
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,153
Want to see it?

37
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,156
It's very small.

38
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,676
But it's just for sleeping,

39
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,677
occasionally other things.

40
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,075
Room size doesn't matter,
it's the bed that counts.

41
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,315
You're right.

42
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,078
Of course I'm right.

43
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,837
I'd love to find a place like this.

44
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,032
When are you moving out?

45
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,798
Why do you ask?

46
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,037
I'm sorry. It was a joke.

47
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,992
Don't be sorry.

48
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,636
I've got a sense of humour.

49
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,718
Are you married, or engaged?

50
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,433
No, unfortunately.

51
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,237
I lived with a woman for 7 years.

52
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,955
Where is she now?

53
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,309
I don't know.

54
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,679
I left her. She couldn't adapt
to my way of thinking.

55
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,034
I really loved her, nevertheless.

56
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,038
But she was never satisfied,
too complicated.

57
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,879
Known your fiancee long?

58
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,114
Pretty long, nearly 3 years.

59
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,959
We were at high school together.

60
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,788
I see.

61
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,268
I can be a real pain.
It's hard on her.

62
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,319
Do you love her?

63
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,391
I've stopped asking myself that.
We get along well.

64
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,510
What do you say?

65
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,914
Women always ask if we love them.
What do you tell her?

66
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,233
I say yes. To keep her off my back.

67
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,749
Why should I explain my feelings?
It's not important.

68
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,598
So what is important?

69
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,479
Books, theatre, art in general.

70
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,636
So what do the two
of you talk about?

71
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,832
I tell her why I think
life is worth living.

72
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,153
Or sometimes we just sit there,
not talking.

73
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,278
You can't always talk.

74
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,718
My girlfriend and I mostly
made love. That was good.

75
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,153
But whenever we talked, we argued.

76
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,479
We made great love.

77
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,198
That isn't important to me.

78
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,995
I don't get much out of it.
Most times, anyway.

79
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,551
Sometimes I just do it
because it seems like I should.

80
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,478
And your girlfriend?

81
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,355
Anna? I don't know.

82
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,392
I've never asked her.
She lies down...

83
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,193
I think she enjoys it.

84
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,078
You mean, she moans?

85
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,191
No, she's always quiet.

86
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,475
My girlfriend was different.

87
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,951
She could never get enough.

88
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,954
It was fantastic!

89
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,829
Yeah?

90
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,669
Yeah. But things got so difficult.

91
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,395
We couldn't open our mouths
without fighting.

92
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,353
Why?

93
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,112
Oh, I take so little pleasure
in things.

94
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,153
Not just sex, but life in general.

95
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,717
When things are new, yes,
there is a certain charm, but then...

96
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,277
You seem to get off on life.

97
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,430
Yes.

98
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,237
Want to play a game?

99
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,748
I don't know.

100
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,678
Do you like games?

101
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,599
Yes, some games. I like chess.

102
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,439
I'm afraid I don't know
how to play chess.

103
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,394
I'd love to learn.
Maybe you can teach me sometime.

104
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,397
Sure, sometime.

105
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,038
How about ludo?

106
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,838
I don't know.

107
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,430
You approach me, bring me home,
now you want to play ludo.

108
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,755
Why?


109
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,236
Because playing games
helps you get to know people.

110
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,474
Why do you want to know me?

111
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,112
Because you have brown eyes,
red hair

112
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,318
and muscular legs.

113
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,911
What colour do you want?

114
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,908
Black. I'll take black.
I always wear black.

115
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,590
It doesn't suit you.
You should pick another colour.

116
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,189
Green would look good
with your hair.

117
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,628
Yeah?

118
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,593
If I had a place,
I'd paint half of it black.

119
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,515
That'd be depressing.
My one black wall makes me ill.

120
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,994
Your turn.

121
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,068
I've tried to decorate this place
with some class.

122
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,190
It looks good.

123
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,549
6...

124
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,439
I'll roll again. 5.

125
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,316
I haven't played ludo in ages.

126
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,193
Last time was with my cousin.
6 years ago.

127
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,674
6! 6 years!

128
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,235
Better pay attention, I'm winning.

129
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,833
5 - 1, 2, 3, 4 and boom!

130
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,312
Back to square one.

131
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,273
What a drag.

132
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,796
You smoke a lot.

133
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,990
So I'm told.

134
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,839
You should be careful.
It's unhealthy.

135
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,315
- I know.
- You bite your nails?

136
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,275
When I'm nervous.

137
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,678
Smoke less, you'll have better skin.
Nicotine ruins the skin.

138
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,869

But I like it.

139
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,433
My turn.

140
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,912
4 - 1, 2, 3, 4 and boom!

141
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,759
Sorry.

142
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,878
You don't like to lose.

143
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,828
In boarding school I went nuts
when my team lost.

144
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,876
If I lose, the game is pointless.

145
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,998
You went to boarding school?

146
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,349
That's of no interest.

147
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,391
I'm interested.

148
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,637
I wish I'd gone to boarding school,
with lots of boys.

149
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,115
But my parents never abandoned me.

150
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,958
Be glad. I hated it.

151
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,197
But why? I think it would be fun.

152
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,958
Fun? You don't realize.

153
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,835
I always wished
I had a home to go back to.

154
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,749
And your parents?

155
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,190
They divorced when I was 5 or 6.

156
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,279
Lots of young people
come from broken homes these days.

157
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,754
Maybe.

158
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,271
But everyone reacts differently.
I had a hard time.

159
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,870
I wish things had been different.

160
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,917
Do you love your parents?

161
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,434
My mother. I really love my mother.

162
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,868
That's good.

163
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,196
I like boys who love their mothers.

164
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,554
I love her like a friend.
We get along well.

165
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,077
Do you live with her?

166
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,318
No. She remarried
and I hate her new husband.

167
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,234
That's a problem.

168
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,556
I live alone right now.

169
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,750
But when Anna and I find a place

170
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,271
things will be
like I always wanted them to be.

171
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,038
If I ever have kids,
I want them to have a real home.

172
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,071
You like children?

173
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,869
No. I mean, I don't know
how to act with them.

174
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,310
Have you ever slept with a man?

175
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,910
What brings that up suddenly?

176
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,592
I'm interested.

177
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,390
At school stuff would happen,
it was innocent.

178
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,115
Really slept with a man? No.

179
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,238
What went on?

180
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,235
I don't know how to tell you
or why you're interested.

181
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,879
Just tell me what it was like.

182
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,395
Well, we were four to a room.

183
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,471
Sometimes, at night, without warning,
one boy got in bed with another.

184
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,678
Flaxer usually got in my bed.

185
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,753
Joachim Flaxer, that was his name.

186
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,556
We'd fondle each other a little,
it went pretty fast.

187
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,997
- With your hands?
- Yes.

188
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,277
Once he kissed me. Tongue and all.

189
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,359
That turned me off,
it was disgusting.

190
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,594
Why?

191
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,833
Because I was a boy and so was he.

192
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,990
It was a weird feeling.
He never tried again.

193
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,879
And otherwise?

194
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,429
Otherwise?

195
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,157
Twice I dreamt
that my mom had married this man.

196

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,070
Both times it was the same one.

197
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,276
He looked good.
Dark features, black hair.

198
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,551
He got into bed with me.

199
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,512
Both times I had...

200
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,758
I don't know how to say it...

201
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,678
Did he talk to you?

202
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,559
I don't think so.

203
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,309
So, what was he like with you?

204
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,589
I was in bed,

205
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,872
then he came in
and took off his coat.

206
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,829
It was strange, he had his coat on.

207
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,990
He took off his jacket and pants.

208
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,794
I didn't say anything,
I just watched.

209
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,988
He took off his shirt and underwear.

210
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,110
How were his legs?

211
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,874
Muscular.

212
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,553
Like a football player.

213
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,117
Did he have a hairy chest?

214
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,595
Yeah, a real bush.

215
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,798
What happened?

216
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,793
He got into bed,

217
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,390
and I felt like I was getting
smaller and smaller

218
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,079
like a girl.

219
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,589
Then what?

220
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,679
He entered me like I was a girl.

221
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,116
He laid on me as if I was a girl

222
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,311
and I probably was, in the dream.

223
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,996
You've never wanted
to try with a man in real life?

224
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,791
No, it never occurred to me.

225
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,716
Let me be frank with you.

226
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,632
I did live for years with
my girlfriend,

227
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,400
but I also slept with men
off and on.

228
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,034
Usually it was much more exciting.

229
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,793
It started unexpectedly.

230
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,834
I was at the beach, swimming,
when I saw a guy

231
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,189
and I thought,

232
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,038
"I've got to have him."

233
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,036
So I just chatted him up.

234
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,912
He understood right away.

235
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,270
Werner was his name.

236
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,516
We went to my place. I was 22.

237
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,233
It's strange,

238
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,029
I found it much better
than with girls.

239
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,759
Maybe.

240
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,916
I saw him again several times.

241
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,510
I ran into him recently.


242
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,632
He's really aged.

243
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,350
I didn't want to kiss him either.

244
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,991
At the time, it seemed unnatural.

245
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,988
But it really isn't,
it's exactly the same.

246
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,278
In fact, the ancient Greeks...

247
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,715
I know, the ancient Greeks...

248
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,830
So, now you want to sleep with me?

249
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,752
Why not?

250
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,912
Yeah, why not?

251
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,072
Really, why not.

252
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,235
You've got big legs
and a hairy chest.

253
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,034
More or less.

254
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,070
Will you kiss me, too?

255
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,396
If you let me.

256
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,869
This feels weird. I drank too much.

257
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,033
Oh well,
tomorrow it'll make more sense.

258
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,832
Your skin is soft.

259
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,752
It's nice.

260
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,716
- I'm a good kisser, huh?
- Very good.

261
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,114
Is this how you operate?

262
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,469
Sometimes.

263
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,478
I fell for it, didn't I?

264
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,352
Get undressed and go to bed.

265
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,596
I'll come like your dream man.

266
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,392
Shall I wear a coat?

267
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,669
I'll wash the glasses
and be right in.

268
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,154
I knew it was you.

269
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,669
Of course it's me, who else?

270
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,949
You 0K?

271
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,633
I'm tired.

272
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,834
Naturally. You had a long drive.

273
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,794
I don't need a long drive
to be tired.

274
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,558
You can be tired anytime.

275
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:15,038
Incredible. I just mention I'm tired
and you get snippy.

276
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,150
I'm not snippy.

277
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,759
I know, I know.

278
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,077
Pretty soon, you'll be right,
and I'll be wrong.

279
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,511
Who cares who's right or wrong?
I don't need to be right.

280
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,711
So why are you so defensive?

281
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,830
I'm not.

282
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,359
Get off my back.

283
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,028
My head hurts.

284
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,320
- Are you hungry?
- A little.

285
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,031
I'll fix you something.
Want a drink?

286
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,309
Whatever.

287
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,193
- Tea or coffee?
- Anything. I don't care.

288
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,628
OK.

289
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,799
Can't you walk quieter?

290
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,352
You're unbelievable!

291
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,314
Can't you wear slippers?
You know shoes are noisy.

292
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,076
Of course. I'm sorry.

293
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,035
Don't be so sarcastic,
you know I'm right.

294
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,070
I wasn't sarcastic. You are right.

295
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,959
Of course I am.

296
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,275
Of course.

297
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,636
Can't you be careful?

298
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,831
I take so little pleasure in things.

299
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,555
I don't need to live with someone
who gets on my nerves!

300
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,630
Here we go. You're never happy.

301
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,432
What's that supposed to mean?

302
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,756
I just asked you to wear slippers.

303
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,872
Shoes are too noisy.
Am I asking too much?

304
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,231
No. I said I'm sorry.
What more do you want?

305
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,440
You're sorry? Did you hear yourself?

306
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,111
Just leave me alone.
You're picking a fight.

307
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,076
Me picking a fight? No way.

308
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,999
I could blow up at you right now,

309
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,633
but I have no desire to.

310
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,637
You're right and I'm wrong.

311
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,955
Leo...

312
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,915
Come on, leave me alone.

313
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,234
Got cigarettes?

314
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,838
Shit, only one. Here.

315
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,439
You can have it.

316
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,551
No, take it. I'll get more.

317
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,354
Thanks.

318
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,911
Make sure we've got
cigarettes from now on.

319
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,310
- Here.
- You keep them.

320
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,988
Must that thing be on
all the time?

321
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,394
No, of course not.

322
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,477
But I thought you'd like music.

323
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,877
Put the record in its sleeve
so it won't get dusty.

324
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,477
Anyway, the needle is bad.

325
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,557
It was bad before I came.

326
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,949
Before you came?
I rarely used the stereo.

327
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,193
It couldn't have been bad
before you came.

328
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,352
Why is it so cold? Must it be?

329
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,789
I forgot to light the stove.
I didn't know you'd be home.

330
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,152
Keep it lit.
You'll get fewer colds, so will I.

331
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,591
I catch your colds,
and I'm no good for days.

332
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,119
Sleeping together spreads germs.

333
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,912
You don't have to sleep with me.

334
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,470
That's not what I'm saying.

335
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,035
You know I love sleeping with you.

336
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,309
Oh yeah?

337
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,228
You take everything the wrong way.

338
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,158
I'm not asking much.

339
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,991
You could be nicer when
I come home.

340
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,919
You could ask me about my day.

341
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,269
How was your day?

342
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,278
Since you asked, I'm a wreck.

343
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,273
I'm filled with anxiety.

344
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,278
I've always got some
pain somewhere.

345
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,233
I take pills, then my stomach hurts.

346
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,351
You should see a doctor.

347
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,710
But when? Tomorrow's Sunday.

348
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,319
I'm leaving Monday.

349
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,509
So soon?

350
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,269
Yes, of course!
Everything's gotten so difficult.

351
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,198
I can't sell anything.

352
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,630
I don't know, but it seems like

353
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,872
since I've known you,
I've lost my touch.

354
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,274
Since you've known me...

355
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,391
Yes. I'm always so anxious.

356
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,194
Running around with no time
to myself.

357
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,708
You're exaggerating.

358
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,990
But you only know me in bed!

359
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,629
Speaking of which...
we're still pretty good in bed, huh?

360
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,437
It doesn't get any better.

361
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,236
You like sleeping with me, huh?

362
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,274
Yes, it's true.

363
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,033
You get lots of pleasure?

364
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,878
You could say that.

365
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,833
What is that supposed to mean?

366
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,359
It means yes.

367
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,313
- I like making love with you, too.
- You do?

368
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,635
Of course I do.

369
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,879
I don't want anyone else.
The idea never crosses my mind.

370
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,116
Me neither.
No women or other men.

371
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,629
I never want another man after you.

372
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,833
What do you mean, after me?
We said we'd be together forever.

373
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,712
Forever is a big word.

374
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,071
Someday you'll find someone
to replace me.

375
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:50,637
I just told you I have no desire
to sleep with other boys.

376
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,555
Maybe not today.

377
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,593
I hate thinking about it,
but I can't help it.

378
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,997
That's your own fault.
I haven't done anything.

379
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,638
How will you leave me?

380
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,997
God, you're complicated.

381
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,792
You get on my nerves.

382
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,638
Oh, fuck this.

383
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,192
Franz...

384
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,119
I'm here.

385
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,876
- Yeah. You're here.
- So?

386
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,358
Monday you're gone again,
for a whole week.

387
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,271
What did you do this week?

388
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,955
I cleaned house,
did all the laundry,

389
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,752
and waxed the floor.

390
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,998
It doesn't show.

391
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,235
Well, I waxed it.

392
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,998
Did you use steel wool?

393
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,679
I didn't know I should.

394
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,633
You need steel wool
to get a good shine.

395
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,638
Next time I'll use it.

396
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,839
I got a job.

397
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,075
Oh yeah? Where?

398
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,599
At a publishing house.

399
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,029
Doing what?

400
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,037
I'm not sure yet. I'll see.

401
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,874
What's your pay?

402
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,633
5 marks an hour,
but I set my own hours.

403
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,875
I don't feel well.

404
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,917
Neither do I.

405
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,954
I killed someone, Franz.

406
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,588
- Really?
- Yes.

407
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,232
Not directly.

408
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,034
One of my customers blew
his head off.

409
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,154
You know,
the one from Ludwigshafen.

410
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,349
All week, I've been wondering
if it's my fault.

411
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,598
I went nuts.
I bawled everyone out.

412
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,358
I had visions.

413
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:59,155
There were devils and spirits
laughing at me.

414
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:04,911

It was like I was someone else,
watching myself from the outside.

415
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,238
I don't know
if I'm responsible for his death.

416
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:15,469
If the police came,
what would I say?

417
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,758
In this town I didn't know,

418
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,509
it was like everyone knew
I had killed someone.

419
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,795
I felt abandoned, alone.

420
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,269
Tell me, what should I do?

421
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,032
Say something!

422
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,396
I don't know...
How did it happen?

423
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,389
How did it happen...

424
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:47,559
I cleaned him out with the insurance,
he must have realized...

425
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,829
You're not responsible. It happens.

426
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,918
I know I'm not
technically responsible, but

427
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,872
I still feel like a bastard.

428
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,799
He was old, he'd saved up
since the war.

429
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,958
So, he killed himself over money.

430
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,757
But he had nothing else, Franz.

431
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,359
No wife, no children.

432
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,311
You're tired. Let's go to bed.

433
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,476
I can't sleep right now.

434
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,349
It'll be alright,
one way or another.

435
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,755
Yeah, one way or another.

436
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,833
We've been together
exactly 6 months today.

437
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,314
Really?

438
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,199
Shall we toast it?

439
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,311
Yes, let's toast it.

440
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,549
Prost.

441
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,716
It's good.

442
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,194
Yes, it's good.

443
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,473
I'm a good kisser, huh?

444
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,908
Very good.

445
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,951
Is this how you operate?

446
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,115
Sometimes.

447
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,356
I fell for it, didn't I?

448
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,514
Get undressed and go to bed.

449
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,510
I'll wash the glasses
and be right in.

450
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,628
Hello.

451
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,877
Is Leopold here, please?

452
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,957
Yes, but he's sleeping.

453
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,159
He must be tired.

454
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,555
He just returned from Ludwigshafen.

455
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,036
Are you one of his customers?

456
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,632
Sort of.

457
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,754
Want to come in and wait?

458
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,238
You're very kind, thank you.

459
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,551
I'll come back.

460
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,035
Want to leave him a message?

461
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,471
No, please...

462
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,757
Please don't tell him I was here.

463
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,759
Whatever you say.

464
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,749
Thank you, goodbye.

465
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,759
Your bath is ready.

466
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,596
Are you hungry?

467
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,119
Not yet.

468
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,830
Maybe after my bath.

469
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,872
Did you sleep well?

470
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,190
We can't sleep two in that bed.
It's too drafty.

471
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,038
We must do something.

472
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,276
Like find a place without drafts.

473
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,948
- You should look for one.
- I know.

474
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,912
You know, but you don't do it.

475
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,315
You act like it's impossible.

476
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,312
It's not that easy.

477
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,192
Try harder!

478
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,714
I'll find one.

479
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,118
Stop it! I've got to take my bath.

480
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,358
For God's sake!

481
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,909
Shut off the music!

482
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,875
Asshole! Motherfucker!

483
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,752
How can you be so selfish?

484
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,190
I've really had enough!

485
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,073
What am I doing with you?
I should move out!

486
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,628
Bastard!

487
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,631
I wrote you a poem.

488
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,594
I'd like to read it,
but I don't have time.

489
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,758
I need to figure out that damn bill.

490
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,433
Obviously.

491
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,276
What's that sarcastic "obviously"
supposed to mean?

492
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,471
I have to do this for work.

493
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,319
Don't take it wrong.

494
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,555
I haven't.

495
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,513
It's funny,
you always add something.

496
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,280
You always have to have
the last word.

497
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,112
Do you know where I put it?

498
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,595
No, I don't.

499
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,710
Naturally.

500
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,394
"Naturally."

501
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,717
When you need help,
there's never anybody there.

502
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,472
Now that's ridiculous.

503
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,399
It's not ridiculous.
It's just a fact.

504
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,158
Never anybody there...

505
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,475
Whatever.

506
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,839
Don't be paranoid.

507
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,794
It's not about you.
It's a general observation.

508
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,674
You find it?

509
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,270
I can't find anything,
it's such a fucking mess!

510
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,629
I didn't touch anything.

511
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:06,231

Then I should be able to find things!
It's like everything's been moved.

512
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,751
"The hat goes on the 3rd nail,

513
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,354
not the 4th."

514
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,232
That's beside the point!

515
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,715
I should be able to find my things!

516
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,559
But I have never touched
your things!

517
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,876
- Why are you so angry?
- I'm not, it's just the truth.

518
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,197
Leave me alone 5 minutes,
go in the other room.

519
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,995
I'd have found that damned bill,
if it wasn't for you!

520
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,714
I could leave
for more than 5 minutes!

521
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,751
- What's that mean?
- You get me.

522
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,109
You want to leave?

523
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,355
Why not?

524
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,075
OK, pick up your shit,
call a taxi and get out now.

525
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,316
I don't need my stuff. You keep it.

526
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,432
No, take it with you,
I'm sick of it!

527
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,034
Go on.

528
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,595
- Then what?
- What, then?

529
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,110
- We'll never see each other again.
- How could we?

530
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,072
OK. As you like.

531
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,235
You want to have your cake
and eat it too?

532
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,189
I love you,
but that's asking too much.

533
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,710
Why? We're good together,
we just can't live together.

534
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,753
Think it over for a week.

535
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,838
We'll find a way to work it out.

536
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,869
Right, we'll work it out...

537
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,393
Why are you getting dressed?

538
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,953
Because I'm leaving.

539
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,115
For where?

540
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,551
I don't know and I don't care.

541
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,069
You can't leave like this.

542
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,272
That remains to be seen.

543
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,875
OK.

544
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,594
Whatever you want.

545
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,548
See you.

546
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,430
You don't mind that I'm leaving.

547
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,995
Sure I do, but you don't believe me.

548
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,153
You expect me to believe you,
sitting there

549
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,635
like you don't even care about me.

550
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:48,112
You know I have to work hard,
or I won't get ahead.

551
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,437
I'm not getting anywhere as it is.

552
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,596
I'm just going backwards.

553
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,757
I can't help you with that.

554
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,510
One day there was something
they couldn't agree on,

555
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,598
a little, unimportant thing,
a difference,

556
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,839
but from then on, there was
no common ground between them,

557
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,669
only differences.

558
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,509
Aren't you working today?

559
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,193
Shit!

560
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,835
Work calms the nerves.
But I'm not going to force you.

561
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:49,870
Good.

562
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:55,189
However, I think
you could make an effort to chip in.

563
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,356
With my lousy salary?

564
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:00,597
I told you how you could
make some pocket money.

565
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,634
Still want me
to play whore, do you?

566
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,428
Make any food?

567
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,911
Bluhm... Yes.

568
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,678
Who? Yes, he's here.

569
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,718
Phone for you.

570
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,114
Here.

571
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,753
A young woman.

572
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,273
Ah, it's you.

573
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,914
I'm fine.

574
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,113
Yes, that was him.

575
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,999
This week?

576
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,668
Got the address?

577
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,189
OK.

578
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,238
See you soon.

579
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,631
- Who was that?
- Anna.

580
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,033
- What's she want?
- Just to talk.

581
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,199
Can't she talk by phone?

582
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,556
Maybe something's wrong.
Or she just wants to see me.

583
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,275
You don't mind?

584
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,069
Why should I mind?

585
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,470
No reason.

586
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,515
You never have a reason.

587
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,429
- Will it be long this time?
- I told you I don't know yet.

588
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,073
It depends on work.

589
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,192
Someone has to bring home
the bacon.

590
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,158
Don't I get a kiss?

591
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,399
Sure you do.

592
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,119
Bon voyage.

593
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,631
The door is open.

594
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,432
Franz, are you home?

595
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,314
What's wrong, Franz?
You're crying?

596
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,389
What's wrong? I love you.

597
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,229
What do you mean, you love me?


598
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,119
Got a cigarette?

599
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,395
Light it.

600
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,198
There's gin in the kitchen.
Bring two glasses.

601
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,719
OK.

602
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,279
Prost, Franz.

603
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,994
To us?

604
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,834
To us, Anna.

605
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,989
Although there is no more "us".

606
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,799
Why do you say that?

607
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,398
You don't seem happy here.

608
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,350
You're sitting in the dark, crying.

609
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,959
Something seems wrong.

610
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,390
That's not true. I'm happy.

611
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,670
Anyway, what is happiness?

612
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,913
I don't know.

613
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,998
Being satisfied and calm...
like we were.

614
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,715

We never knew happiness, Anna.

615
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,797
We just dreamt about it.

616
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,718
Happiness is something else.

617
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:08,359
Here, I may well have been happy.

618
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,749
At first,
everything was so different.

619
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,956
But maybe it was just a dream.

620
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,798
What happened?

621
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,672
I don't know...

622
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:25,111
One fine day
everything I did and said was wrong.

623
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,556
He was no longer happy with me.

624
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,028
Why?

625
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,430
Stop asking questions.

626
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,759
Tell me about you.

627
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,117
There isn't much to say.

628
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,909
Everything is like before.

629
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,199
Almost everything.

630
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,874
Almost?

631
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,638
Yes. Almost.

632
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:52,436
What's changed?

633
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:58,275
Franz, I've met a man
who wants to marry me.

634
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,316
Is that why you called me?

635
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,438
I wanted to see you again
before I said yes.

636
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,032
Why?

637
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,949
Because I love you, not him.

638
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,870
Don't say anything, not just yet.

639
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,229
Think about it.

640
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,271
Why should I think about it?

641
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,278
I love Leopold.
End of story.

642
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,956
But what about all our plans?

643
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,910
Our children, our house?

644
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,793
That was all bullshit.

645
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,560
No, Franz.
We could have made it, if you...

646
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,830
Anna, you're still dreaming.

647
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,798
Marry this man.

648
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,719
Have his children.
I'll be godfather.

649
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,589
You're cruel. Why are you so cruel?

650
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,834
I'm not cruel, just realistic.

651
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,678
We've known each other
exactly 4 years today.

652
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,554
What is it?

653
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:01,194
"We've known each other 4 years...

654
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,231
...we must celebrate."

655
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:07,679
C'mon Anna,
that's just stupid sentimentality.

656
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,994
But we always used to celebrate it.

657
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,839
Really? I forgot.

658
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,756
Life changes, Anna.

659
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,756
Listen to you. You've changed.

660
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,830
You, too. You've changed.

661
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,439
For the better.

662
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,112
You're much prettier.

663
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,635
You're just saying that.

664
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,319
Did you enjoy it when we had sex?

665
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,875
Of course I did.

666
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,195
Really enjoy it?

667
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:45,237
I don't know.
It depends which times.

668
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,912
I still like you a lot.

669
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,833
Me too, I love you.

670
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,558
What's the matter?

671
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:56,954
Should something be?

672
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,878
I don't know, you're so quiet.


673
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,991
I don't have anything to say.

674
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,200
Let's talk about
how many kids we'll have.

675
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,470
How many, 5?

676
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,749
No, 2.
2 kids are plenty.

677
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,831
What will we call them?

678
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,551
We'll have 2 boys.

679
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,275
They'll be named Franz and Leopold,
Leopold and Franz.

680
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,076
You must stop thinking about him.

681
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,032
We're still at his place.

682
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:33,873
But today we'll pack your bags
and leave.

683
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,716
- Got any money?
- A little.

684
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,717
A little? How much is that?

685
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,470
You never used to care about money.

686
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,511
It'll be enough.

687
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,199
If you say so.

688
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,194
We'll look for a place.
With 2 rooms.

689
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,230
Again?

690
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,431
Don't worry, I'll handle it.

691
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:04,633
You can read books, go to
the theatre, and tell me about it.

692
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,751
Anna, you're dreaming again.

693
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,679
You know reality
is always different.

694
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:14,910
Why?

695
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:18,271
Because I'll have
to find a real job.

696
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,830
But I've already got a real job.

697
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,599
What've you told them?

698
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,439
I'm on vacation for another 2 weeks.

699
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:28,553
I have to work all summer
to make it up.

700
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:34,315
We went to Greece last summer.

701
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,598
That's over now.

702
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,476
Next time you go to Greece,
it'll be with me.

703
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,713
I guess so.

704
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,879
What should I do about Leopold?

705
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,469
I must see him
and explain everything.

706
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,238
What for?

707
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,831
Write him a letter, tell him it
was great, but now it's over.

708
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,790
Yes, I'll write him a letter.

709
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,549
But when he comes home
Saturday night

710
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,876
it'll be cold here, he'll be alone.

711
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,719
So? That's what he wants, isn't it?

712
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,756
Yeah, that's what he wants.

713
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:06,550
Now, let's get dressed.
We've got a lot to do.

714
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,875
I'd like to stay in
the bedroom awhile.

715
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,229
Of course.

716
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,993
Don't take it badly.

717
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,236
It's just I liked it here.

718
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,998
I'm not saying anything.

719
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,918
I understand completely.

720
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,354
It's not easy for me
to leave like this.

721
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,558
Alone, I never could have.

722
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,877
But now we're together,
and we'll make it.

723
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,674
Yes, we'll make it...

724
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,311
What's wrong?
Didn't we agree to leave?

725
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,839
Yes, it's 0K.

726
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,999
I just want to stay a bit longer.
Is that too much to ask?

727
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,428
No, it's alright.

728
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,518
- You know?
- What?

729
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,910
I think I still love him.

730
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,390
I think I love him a lot.

731
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:14,478
But you know it won't work
in the long run!

732
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,513
Put on a record.

733
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:17,630
Which one?

734
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,114
You know the one.

735
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,634
Obviously...

736
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,956
Franz, someone's at the door!

737
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:53,431
Hello, Madam.

738
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:01,910
You alright?

739
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,915
It's nothing, excuse me.

740
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,238
I got the wrong door.

741
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,354
It's 0K.

742
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,719
It was a mistake!

743
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,199
What's wrong now?

744
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,319
You're crying again...

745
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,151
You've got to forget him.

746
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,588
It isn't so easy!

747
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,712
But you must.
We've got to start over.

748
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,515
Someone's here.

749
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:55,830
My God!

750
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,155
What is it, Miss?

751
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:58,349
Uh, nothing.

752
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,312
You're back already?

753
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,876
Aren't you glad to see me?

754
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,513
Sure I am.

755
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:05,630
Introduce us!

756
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:10,429
Mr. Bluhm,
meet Anna I've told you about...

757
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,915
Hello. We were just moving out.

758
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,757
That's a good one!

759
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,199
Make some coffee, Franz.

760
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,150
Come sit next to me, Miss.

761
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,877
Perhaps I should get dressed?

762
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,752
That won't be necessary.

763
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:00,315
You're perfectly lovely as you are.

764
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,715
Wow, you've got an eye
for that, too?

765
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,717
- Why not?
- I just thought...

766
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,433
So Franz wants to move?

767
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,232
Yes. We're getting married.

768
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:11,557
Oh? You think
Franz is the marrying kind?

769
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,239
Why not?

770
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,873
Tell me, dear Anna,

771
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,792
do you love Franz?

772
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,912
Why shouldn't I love him?

773
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:21,712
He's still very young.

774
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,990
Is that a reason not to love him?

775
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,428
Of course not.

776
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:28,548
On the contrary.

777
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:51,113
Thank you.
Would you serve us please?

778
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,478
So, you want to move?

779
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:56,989
Why only now?

780
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,519
Why not "only now"?

781
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:02,076
You wouldn't have left
without saying goodbye?

782
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,430
- Who knows?
- I know.

783
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,068
I'll get it.

784
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,038
Leo, Helmut left me.

785
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:20,830
Excuse me,
I don't know you, who are you?

786
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:24,471
Leo, it's me, Vera.

787
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,038
Vera, my dear!

788
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,190
My God, how you've aged.

789
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:34,879
You never said he was so sexy
for his age. Now I understand.

790
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,718
So go fuck him, slut.

791
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,358
Anna, Franz,

792
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,915
this is Vera, an old friend.

793
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:45,795
I mean a former buddy
who cut his dick off in Casablanca.

794
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:48,869
Hello, Madam.

795
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,229
Hello.

796
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:57,874
Excuse me, you're the woman
who put up with Leo 7 years?

797
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:02,679
If it had been up to me,
we'd still be together today.

798
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,995
Vera loves to be tied down,

799
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:08,591
especially by the hands and feet.

800
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,597
Always willing to be displayed,

801
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,552
mauled...

802
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,998
isn't that right?

803
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,395
You too, huh, Franz?

804
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,794
- Want to humiliate us?
- Unbelievable!

805
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:24,117
Instead of being happy
to see me, you moan.

806
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,836
Don't worry, we're leaving. Anna?

807
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:30,635
I want to stay awhile.
The situation is so exciting!

808
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,038
Fine, I'll go alone.

809
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,276
What's wrong, Franz?

810
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:39,118
Not happy I'm back early?

811
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,788
If you only knew how happy I am.

812
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,468
Don't be angry, my little man.

813
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:48,309
Try to behave in front
of my old friend Vera, please.

814
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:52,232
Thrilled to make
this dear lady's acquaintance.

815
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,238
Franz, be nice.

816
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:56,511
Why be nice? I don't get it.

817
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:58,439
You're all so bizarre,

818
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,598
like puppets,
manipulated by God knows who!

819
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,198
Franz loves me.

820
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,191
Deep down he is crazy about me.

821
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,118
I'm crazy about him!

822
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,319
Tell him just how crazy.

823
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:18,358
We've made love
for two days straight.

824
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:19,913
We got lots of pleasure.

825
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,475
Naturally. I've taught him well.

826
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,597
You should thank me.

827
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,279
Oh, I do thank you.

828
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:30,078
I'm eternally grateful.
Aren't I, Franz?

829
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,674
- Yes!
- Leopold!

830
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,439
Yes, my dear?

831
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,316
I need to talk to you alone.

832
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:38,670
Hold on a minute,

833
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,791
wait your turn.

834
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,472
Nice game you've got going.

835
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:48,353
Unfortunately,
I didn't win on purpose.

836
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:51,074
A little diversion... for four.

837
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,192
You disgust me.

838
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,153
Near the closet are...

839
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,396
Your slippers? I'll get them.

840
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,671
Leo's nice little slippers.

841
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,678
There you go taking it badly again.

842
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,518
I'm not taking it badly.

843
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:09,597
- Sure you're not.
- I'm not.

844
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:10,994
I know.

845
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,078
- How do you say it?
- How it's said!

846
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:17,274
Girls, I'm hungry!
Fix me something.

847
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:18,629
- What?
- Some beer?

848
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:21,195
Hop to it! Whatever, a snack...

849
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,438
Check the fridge.

850
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,792
Was it a good week?

851
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:31,353
I mean, was there another suicide?

852
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,957
Oh, that's too bad.

853
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,158
Why is it so cold here?

854
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,634
The stove's not lit.

855
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:41,035
So light it. God, it's obvious.

856
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:42,634
I'm not asking much.

857
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,273
So do it yourself.

858
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,710
Here's a little sandwich.

859
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:49,480
Put it down there.
Give me the beer.

860
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:52,872
Can I put on a record?

861
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,435
That's enough!

862
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,673
Everyone in the bedroom.

863
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:23,753
Aren't you coming?

864
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,673
You need me?

865
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,711
You need me!

866
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,113
I'll be right there.

867
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:24,315
You're wearing my coat.

868
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:26,512
I was cold.

869
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:30,238
Why are you crying?

870
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:33,598
Because I'm unhappy.

871
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:39,954
Not fucking anymore?

872
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:43,675
I'm fed up.
He's only interested in her.

873
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:45,798
Fresh flesh wins out.

874
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,673
He never would've
done this to me before.

875
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:52,229
Before he was very different.

876
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,438
10 years have passed,

877
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:58,269
I just got dumped, he doesn't care.
Can you understand that?

878
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,755
No, I don't understand, either.

879
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:05,598
I've suffered in every way
imaginable.

880
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:08,191
So much sadness.

881
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,911
Even after all these years?

882
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:15,076
I'll suffer forever.

883
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:18,875
Can't you forget him?

884
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,468
How could I forget him?

885
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:28,112
Even with the others,

886
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:30,710
I think of him.

887
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,637
I'm his creature.

888
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:36,314
How so?

889
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:42,951
When I met Leopold,
I had just come to Germany.

890
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:47,312
I was like you: Young, innocent,
and most of all, lost.

891
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,557
Starved for love.

892
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:54,270
He taught me everything about sex.

893
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,392
It was wonderful.

894
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,191
He was so good,

895
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:09,719
he made me feel like
I existed for the very first time.

896
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,838
I was happy.

897
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:18,518
That is,
until he stopped desiring me.

898
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:24,235
He touched me less and less.

899
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,716
Everything changed.

900
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,116
It was unbearable.

901
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:39,351
So, I took a drastic measure,

902
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,194
crazy,

903
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:43,632
crazy with love...

904
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:46,512
He'd once said to me,

905
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:50,269
"If you were a woman
I'd have married you."

906
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:56,350
I had a sex change for him,

907
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:59,276
out of love for him,

908
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:01,232
so he'd want me again.

909
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:07,558
I was a boy and I became a woman.

910
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,955
I spent all my savings.

911
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:14,472
For awhile, his desire was revived.

912
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:16,879
It was the newness...

913
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:19,036
I deluded myself.

914
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:24,114
Then the desire died again.

915
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:29,675
He made me a whore.

916
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:31,916
Then he left me.

917
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:36,435
You still love Leopold?

918
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:49,879
Me too.

919
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,670
In the true sense of the word...

920
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:54,953
I love him.

921
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,036
How do I look to you?

922
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:13,035
I don't know. Not bad.

923
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:16,113
Thanks.

924
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,271
I'm not too old for you?

925
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:21,391
No, you're still beautiful.

926
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,074
Well...

927
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:27,796
Maybe we could
try something together.

928
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:29,878
It's too late.

929
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:32,553
Why?

930
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,712
I took some poison.

931
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:36,869
Really?

932
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,515
- But why?
- Why not?

933
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:44,391
You're so pale!

934
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:46,832
Go get me the telephone.

935
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:04,150
Mom? It's me.

936
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:07,952
I took some poison.

937
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,111
Nothing can be done.

938
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:16,195
There's no point in coming.

939
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:21,359
Maybe I'll go to heaven,
since I'm so young.

940
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:26,708
Thanks, Mom.

941
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:33,595
What did your mother say?

942
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:35,792
Bon voyage.

943
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:37,988
She has no heart.

944
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:40,760
She does,
but just in the right place.

945
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:45,391
Now let me die in peace.

Is that too much to ask?

946
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:47,951
You sound like Leopold.

947
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,073
That's no surprise.

948
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,670
I'm his creature, too.

949
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,314
Do you like your job?

950
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:07,839
Not much.

951
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:09,633
How much do you make?

952
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,558
It depends. Not a lot.

953
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,830
Would you like to earn more?

954
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:18,075
I know an easy way to make money.

955
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,551
You'll need to work for me.

956
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,518
Why not?

957
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:24,551
Like a little spanking?

958
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:27,319
Here we go.

959
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:56,791
He's really dead.

960
01:12:58,760 --> 01:12:59,954
So young...

961
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:17,475
Come here, please!

962
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:27,156
Now what?

963
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,031
Your friend is dead.

964
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:36,232
Franz?
No, he's just being melodramatic.

965
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:41,153
He's not.

966
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:54,954
He's dead. You're right.

967
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:57,874
This is horrible. What will we do?

968
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,470
There's nothing we can do.

969
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,199
You killed him?

970
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,755
Me? What are you talking about?

971
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,633
You disturbed him.
He could've lived to 80,

972
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:09,589
or at least 70.

973
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:10,994
What's going on?

974
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:13,875
He's dead.

975
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:15,395
Who?

976
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,118
My God!

977
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,992
- Calm down.
- Who'll father my children?

978
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,555
Little Franz and Leopold...

979
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:33,074
Go back to bed. I'll be right in.

980
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:30,872
Hello, my dear lady. Bluhm speaking.

981
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:32,672
Sorry to bother you.

982
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:35,352
Your son is dead.

983
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:38,191
Oh, you already knew.

984
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,154
Well...

985
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:44,158
What?
No, that's no problem for me.

986
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,239
Not at all.

987
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:49,312
Sorry for disturbing you.

988
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:51,393
Goodbye, Madam.

989
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,870
I want to go, there's a corpse here.

990
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:56,274
I know.

991
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,514
We must call the police, and then...

992
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,911
I'd like to get my coat back.

993
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:03,912
We'll do that later.
