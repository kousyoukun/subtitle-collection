00:01:16,317 --> 00:01:20,726
WATER DROPS ON BURNING ROCKS

4
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,196
Come in.

5
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,333
Prost.

6
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:54,766
I don't know why I came with you.

7
00:02:55,903 --> 00:02:57,116
I had a date.

8
00:02:57,817 --> 00:02:59,877
How old are you? No, let me guess.

9
00:03:00,484 --> 00:03:01,542
19?

10
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:04,083
That's it. Well, 20 actually.

11
00:03:05,183 --> 00:03:08,183
My birthday was one week ago today.

12
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,080
Age doesn't matter to me.

13
00:03:11,764 --> 00:03:13,133
- Really?
- No.

14
00:03:13,692 --> 00:03:14,800
And me?

15
00:03:15,858 --> 00:03:17,364
How old do you think I am?

16
00:03:17,858 --> 00:03:19,238
I don't know, 50?

17
00:03:19,513 --> 00:03:20,658
50!

18
00:03:21,961 --> 00:03:23,708
No one's ever said that!

19
00:03:23,983 --> 00:03:25,382
But that's it, isn't it?

20
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:28,149
Precisely.

21
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:41,253
I was supposed to meet Anna tonight.
She'll be mad.

22
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,600
It's weird, I really
wanted to see her.

23
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:47,327
What made you say 50?

24
00:03:48,775 --> 00:03:50,915
You talk like people that age.

25
00:03:51,278 --> 00:03:52,301
Really?

26
00:03:54,364 --> 00:03:56,957
But physically, don't I look younger?

27
00:03:57,426 --> 00:04:00,030
Yeah, physically you
look much younger.

28
00:04:14,738 --> 00:04:16,712
Maybe I'll go straight to Anna's.

29
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,572
Anna and I want to get married.

30
00:04:20,058 --> 00:04:22,711
We need to find an apartment, though.

31
00:04:23,087 --> 00:04:24,171
I see.

32
00:04:24,858 --> 00:04:26,269
Your place is nice.

33
00:04:27,942 --> 00:04:29,728
I don't like it much.

34
00:04:30,233 --> 00:04:31,748
I haven't really moved in yet.

35
00:04:33,008 --> 00:04:35,542
Can you drive me back?
It's pretty far.

36
00:04:37,051 --> 00:04:39,531
Naturally, when the time comes.

37
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,253
Are there other rooms?

38
00:04:50,807 --> 00:04:52,000
A bedroom.

39
00:04:53,468 --> 00:04:54,628
Want to see it?

40
00:05:01,336 --> 00:05:02,943
It's very small.

41
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:05,750
But it's just for sleeping,

42
00:05:06,192 --> 00:05:07,890
occasionally other things.

43
00:05:09,858 --> 00:05:13,371
Room size doesn't matter,
it's the bed that counts.

44
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,039
You're right.

45
00:05:15,192 --> 00:05:16,484
Of course I'm right.

46
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,020
I'd love to find a place like this.

47
00:05:21,377 --> 00:05:22,698
When are you moving out?

48
00:05:23,306 --> 00:05:24,538
Why do you ask?

49
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,938
I'm sorry. It was a joke.

50
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,940
Don't be sorry.

51
00:05:29,858 --> 00:05:31,446
I've got a sense of humour.

52
00:05:48,911 --> 00:05:50,411
Are you married, or engaged?

53
00:05:51,025 --> 00:05:52,251
No, unfortunately.

54
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,176
I lived with a woman for 7 years.

55
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,429
Where is she now?

56
00:05:59,528 --> 00:06:00,630
I don't know.

57
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,376
I left her.

58
00:06:03,356 --> 00:06:05,002
She couldn't adapt
to my way of thinking.

59
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,193
I really loved her, nevertheless.

60
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:11,493
But she was never
satisfied, too complicated.

61
00:06:14,647 --> 00:06:16,108
Known your fiancÃ©e long?

62
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:18,808
Pretty long, nearly 3 years.

63
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:21,887
We were at high school together.

64
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,013
I see.

65
00:06:25,275 --> 00:06:27,781
I can be a real pain.
It's hard on her.

66
00:06:29,696 --> 00:06:30,868
Do you love her?

67
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:36,321
I've stopped asking myself that.
We get along well.

68
00:06:36,484 --> 00:06:37,571
What do you say?

69
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,220
Women always ask if we love them.
What do you tell her?

70
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:44,913
I say yes. To keep her off my back.

71
00:06:46,565 --> 00:06:50,104
Why should I explain my feelings?
It's not important.

72
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,731
So what is important?

73
00:06:54,466 --> 00:06:57,926
Books, theatre, art in general.

74
00:06:59,141 --> 00:07:00,773
So what do the two of you

75
00:07:01,427 --> 00:07:02,647
talk about?

76
00:07:02,817 --> 00:07:05,848
I tell her why I think
life is worth living.

77
00:07:06,358 --> 00:07:09,798
Or sometimes we just
sit there, not talking.

78
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:12,411
You can't always talk.

79
00:07:12,536 --> 00:07:16,664
My girlfriend and I mostly made love.
That was good.

80
00:07:17,859 --> 00:07:20,353
But whenever we talked, we argued.

81
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,473
We made great love.

82
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:28,080
That isn't important to me.

83
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:31,419
I don't get much out of it.
Most times, anyway.

84
00:07:33,491 --> 00:07:36,211
Sometimes I just do it
because it seems like I should.

85
00:07:37,275 --> 00:07:38,458
And your girlfriend?

86
00:07:39,422 --> 00:07:41,782
Anna? I don't know.

87
00:07:43,895 --> 00:07:46,502
I've never asked her.
She lies down...

88
00:07:49,491 --> 00:07:50,905
I think she enjoys it.

89
00:07:53,325 --> 00:07:55,158
You mean, she moans?

90
00:07:55,382 --> 00:07:56,844
No, she's always quiet.

91
00:07:59,358 --> 00:08:01,071
My girlfriend was different.

92
00:08:03,395 --> 00:08:04,695
She could never get enough.

93
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:07,292
It was fantastic!

94
00:08:08,442 --> 00:08:09,473
Yeah?

95
00:08:09,591 --> 00:08:10,591
Yeah.

96
00:08:11,298 --> 00:08:13,145
But things got so difficult.

97
00:08:13,671 --> 00:08:16,657
We couldn't open our
mouths without fighting.

98
00:08:17,922 --> 00:08:19,096
Why?

99
00:08:20,308 --> 00:08:23,148
Oh, I take so little
pleasure in things.

100
00:08:23,485 --> 00:08:26,135
Not just sex, but life in general.

101
00:08:26,612 --> 00:08:30,845
When things are new, yes,
there is a certain charm, but then...

102
00:08:33,067 --> 00:08:35,260
You seem to get off on life.

103
00:08:37,555 --> 00:08:38,555
Yes.

104
00:08:43,297 --> 00:08:44,711
Want to play a game?

105
00:08:45,574 --> 00:08:46,724
I don't know.

106
00:08:47,108 --> 00:08:48,424
Do you like games?

107
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:51,901
Yes, some games. I like chess.

108
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:54,548
I'm afraid I don't know
how to play chess.

109
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:58,454
I'd love to learn.
Maybe you can teach me sometime.

110
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:00,688
Sure, sometime.

111
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:03,466
How about ludo?

112
00:09:04,108 --> 00:09:05,246
I don't know.

113
00:09:05,942 --> 00:09:09,342
You approach me, bring me
home, now you want to play ludo.

114
00:09:09,725 --> 00:09:10,842
Why?

115
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,773
Because playing games
helps you get to know people.

116
00:09:15,257 --> 00:09:17,170
Why do you want to know me?

117
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:21,204
Because you have brown eyes, red hair

118
00:09:22,063 --> 00:09:23,451
and muscular legs.

119
00:09:25,714 --> 00:09:27,375
What colour do you want?

120
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,853
Black. I'll take black.

121
00:09:30,806 --> 00:09:32,093
I always wear black.

122
00:09:32,223 --> 00:09:35,542
It doesn't suit you.
You should pick another colour.

123
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:38,323
Green would look good with your hair.

124
00:09:38,601 --> 00:09:39,753
Yeah?

125
00:09:40,061 --> 00:09:42,613
If I had a place, I'd
paint half of it black.

126
00:09:43,353 --> 00:09:47,000
That'd be depressing.
My one black wall makes me ill.

127
00:09:47,275 --> 00:09:48,453
Your turn.

128
00:09:48,866 --> 00:09:52,500
I've tried to decorate
this place with some class.

129
00:09:53,013 --> 00:09:54,221
It looks good.

130
00:09:54,246 --> 00:09:55,444
6...

131
00:09:56,025 --> 00:09:57,487
I'll roll again. 5.

132
00:09:58,158 --> 00:10:00,092
I haven't played ludo in ages.

133
00:10:00,594 --> 00:10:02,241
Last time was with my cousin.

134
00:10:02,577 --> 00:10:03,583
6 years ago.

135
00:10:03,608 --> 00:10:05,014
6! 6 years!

136
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,714
Better pay attention, I'm winning.

137
00:10:09,392 --> 00:10:12,584
5... 1, 2, 3, 4 and boom!

138
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,976
Back to square one.

139
00:10:15,608 --> 00:10:16,834
What a drag.

140
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:20,942
- You smoke a lot.
- So I'm told.

141
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,791
You should be careful.
It's unhealthy.

142
00:10:23,876 --> 00:10:24,876
I know.

143
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,595
You bite your nails?

144
00:10:27,616 --> 00:10:28,662
When I'm nervous.

145
00:10:28,687 --> 00:10:31,180
Smoke less, you'll have better skin.

146
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,873
Nicotine ruins the skin.

147
00:10:33,221 --> 00:10:34,334
But I like it.

148
00:10:34,525 --> 00:10:35,788
My turn.

149
00:10:36,485 --> 00:10:39,025
4... 1, 2, 3, 4 and boom!

150
00:10:42,192 --> 00:10:43,272
Sorry.

151
00:10:45,105 --> 00:10:46,545
You don't like to lose.

152
00:10:48,025 --> 00:10:51,545
In boarding school I went
nuts when my team lost.

153
00:10:52,881 --> 00:10:54,655
If I lose, the game is pointless.

154
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:57,083
You went to boarding school?

155
00:10:57,486 --> 00:10:58,776
That's of no interest.

156
00:10:58,889 --> 00:11:00,423
I'm interested.

157
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:03,728
I wish I'd gone to boarding
school, with lots of boys.

158
00:11:04,429 --> 00:11:06,301
But my parents never abandoned me.

159
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:08,900
Be glad. I hated it.

160
00:11:09,016 --> 00:11:12,093
But why? I think it would be fun.

161
00:11:12,358 --> 00:11:14,071
Fun? You don't realize.

162
00:11:14,192 --> 00:11:17,251
I always wished I
had a home to go to.

163
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,955
And your parents?

164
00:11:20,277 --> 00:11:22,386
They divorced when I was 5 or 6.

165
00:11:23,588 --> 00:11:26,741
Lots of young people come
from broken homes these days.

166
00:11:26,991 --> 00:11:28,148
Maybe.

167
00:11:28,699 --> 00:11:31,833
But everyone reacts differently.
I had a hard time.

168
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,093
I wish things had been different.

169
00:11:35,914 --> 00:11:37,321
Do you love your parents?

170
00:11:38,858 --> 00:11:41,438
My mother. I really love my mother.

171
00:11:41,728 --> 00:11:42,884
That's good.

172
00:11:43,241 --> 00:11:45,131
I like boys who love their mothers.

173
00:11:46,025 --> 00:11:49,564
I love her like a friend.
We get along well.

174
00:11:50,775 --> 00:11:52,648
Do you live with her?

175
00:11:53,108 --> 00:11:55,541
No.
She remarried and I hate her new husband.

176
00:11:57,757 --> 00:11:59,001
That's a problem.

177
00:11:59,235 --> 00:12:00,970
I live alone right now.

178
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,723
But when Anna and I find a place

179
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:07,536
things will be like I
always wanted them to be.

180
00:12:09,047 --> 00:12:13,020
If I ever have kids, I want
them to have a real home.

181
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:14,907
You like children?

182
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:19,972
No.
I mean, I don't know how to act with them.

183
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,583
Have you ever slept with a man?

184
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,410
What brings that up suddenly?

185
00:12:30,054 --> 00:12:31,273
I'm interested.

186
00:12:33,034 --> 00:12:36,421
At school stuff would
happen, it was innocent.

187
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,856
Really slept with a man? No.

188
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:43,280
What went on?

189
00:12:46,248 --> 00:12:49,581
I don't know how to tell
you or why you're interested.

190
00:12:53,233 --> 00:12:55,532
Just tell me what it was like.

191
00:13:11,908 --> 00:13:13,655
Well, we were four to a room.

192
00:13:14,702 --> 00:13:19,335
Sometimes, at night, without warning,
one boy got in bed with another.

193
00:13:19,775 --> 00:13:21,966
Flaxer usually got in my bed.

194
00:13:23,192 --> 00:13:25,379
Joachim Flaxer, that was his name.

195
00:13:26,608 --> 00:13:29,007
We'd fondle each other
a little, it went pretty fast.

196
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,793
With your hands?

197
00:13:32,283 --> 00:13:33,283
Yes.

198
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:37,553
Once he kissed me. Tongue and all.

199
00:13:38,645 --> 00:13:40,584
That turned me off,
it was disgusting.

200
00:13:42,358 --> 00:13:43,511
Why?

201
00:13:44,192 --> 00:13:46,531
Because I was a boy and so was he.

202
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:51,652
It was a weird feeling.
He never tried again.

203
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:55,142
And otherwise?

204
00:13:56,757 --> 00:13:57,936
Otherwise?

205
00:13:59,692 --> 00:14:02,292
Twice I dreamt that my
mum had married this man.

206
00:14:03,817 --> 00:14:05,310
Both times it was the same one.

207
00:14:06,734 --> 00:14:09,421
He looked good.
Dark features, black hair.

208
00:14:10,656 --> 00:14:12,563
He got into bed with me.

209
00:14:12,881 --> 00:14:14,189
Both times I had...

210
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,880
I don't know how to say it...

211
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,646
Did he talk to you?

212
00:14:19,512 --> 00:14:20,778
I don't think so.

213
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:24,588
So, what was he like with you?

214
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,348
I was in bed,

215
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:30,083
then he came in
and took off his coat.

216
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,157
It was strange, he had his coat on.

217
00:14:34,817 --> 00:14:36,883
He took off his jacket and pants.

218
00:14:37,265 --> 00:14:39,303
I didn't say anything,
I just watched.

219
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,757
He took off his shirt and underwear.

220
00:14:43,608 --> 00:14:44,717
How were his legs?

221
00:14:46,165 --> 00:14:47,298
Muscular.

222
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,985
Like a football player.

223
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:52,435
Did he have a hairy chest?

224
00:14:53,014 --> 00:14:54,922
Yeah, a real bush.

225
00:14:56,033 --> 00:14:57,240
What happened?

226
00:14:59,256 --> 00:15:00,583
He got into bed,

227
00:15:01,048 --> 00:15:04,170
and I felt like I was
getting smaller and smaller

228
00:15:04,797 --> 00:15:06,091
like a girl.

229
00:15:13,061 --> 00:15:14,176
Then what?

230
00:15:16,605 --> 00:15:18,752
He entered me like I was a girl.

231
00:15:20,926 --> 00:15:23,280
He laid on me as if I was a girl

232
00:15:23,305 --> 00:15:25,126
and I probably was, in the dream.

233
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,789
You've never wanted to
try with a man in real life?

234
00:15:37,297 --> 00:15:38,744
No, it never occurred to me.

235
00:15:41,396 --> 00:15:42,836
Let me be frank with you.

236
00:15:44,306 --> 00:15:47,360
I did live for years
with my girlfriend,

237
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:50,593
but I also slept with men off and on.

238
00:15:51,526 --> 00:15:53,587
Usually it was much more exciting.

239
00:15:54,608 --> 00:15:56,068
It started unexpectedly.

240
00:15:56,093 --> 00:15:59,721
I was at the beach,
swimming, when I saw a guy

241
00:16:00,608 --> 00:16:02,634
and I thought, "I've
got to have him."

242
00:16:04,693 --> 00:16:06,426
So I just chatted him up.

243
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:08,559
He understood right away.

244
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,708
Werner was his name.

245
00:16:11,366 --> 00:16:13,415
We went to my place. I was 22.

246
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,842
It's strange,

247
00:16:15,817 --> 00:16:18,310
I found it much
better than with girls.

248
00:16:22,817 --> 00:16:23,963
Maybe.

249
00:16:26,296 --> 00:16:27,810
I saw him again several times.

250
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,610
I ran into him recently.

251
00:16:31,634 --> 00:16:32,814
He's really aged.

252
00:16:34,936 --> 00:16:36,742
I didn't want to kiss him either.

253
00:16:38,033 --> 00:16:39,787
At the time, it seemed unnatural.

254
00:16:40,281 --> 00:16:43,927
But it really isn't,
it's exactly the same.

255
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:47,126
In fact, the ancient Greeks...

256
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:49,499
I know, the ancient Greeks...

257
00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:56,366
So, now you want to sleep with me?

258
00:16:57,942 --> 00:16:59,099
Why not?

259
00:17:00,108 --> 00:17:01,501
Yeah, why not?

260
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,594
Really, why not.

261
00:17:04,868 --> 00:17:07,395
You've got big legs
and a hairy chest.

262
00:17:08,942 --> 00:17:10,089
More or less.

263
00:17:11,186 --> 00:17:12,689
Will you kiss me, too?

264
00:17:13,692 --> 00:17:15,092
If you let me.

265
00:17:28,483 --> 00:17:30,496
This feels weird. I drank too much.

266
00:17:31,396 --> 00:17:33,863
Oh well, tomorrow
it'll make more sense.

267
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,683
Your skin is soft.

268
00:17:37,503 --> 00:17:38,678
It's nice.

269
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,380
- I'm a good kisser, huh?
- Very good.

270
00:17:46,597 --> 00:17:47,986
Is this how you operate?

271
00:17:48,047 --> 00:17:49,245
Sometimes.

272
00:17:49,692 --> 00:17:51,278
I fell for it, didn't I?

273
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,284
Get undressed and go to bed.

274
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:55,225
I'll come like your dream man.

275
00:17:55,847 --> 00:17:57,226
Shall I wear a coat?

276
00:18:01,692 --> 00:18:03,425
I'll wash the glasses
and be right in.

277
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:51,318
<i>I know not if there is a reason</i>

278
00:18:52,526 --> 00:18:54,511
<i>Why I am so sad at heart.</i>

279
00:18:55,578 --> 00:18:57,978
<i>A legend of bygone ages</i>

280
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,511
<i>Haunts me and will not depart.</i>

281
00:19:04,548 --> 00:19:06,168
<i>The air is cool</i>

282
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,208
<i>under nightfall.</i>

283
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:11,919
<i>The calm Rhine courses its way.</i>

284
00:20:04,108 --> 00:20:05,436
I knew it was you.

285
00:20:05,643 --> 00:20:07,401
Of course it's me, who else?

286
00:20:08,282 --> 00:20:09,397
You OK?

287
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:10,870
I'm tired.

288
00:20:11,755 --> 00:20:13,948
Naturally. You had a long drive.

289
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:17,688
I don't need a long
drive to be tired.

290
00:20:17,713 --> 00:20:19,413
You can be tired anytime.

291
00:20:19,548 --> 00:20:23,906
Incredible. I just mention
I'm tired and you get snippy.

292
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,350
I'm not snippy.

293
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,788
I know, I know.

294
00:20:27,054 --> 00:20:30,021
Pretty soon, you'll be
right, and I'll be wrong.

295
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,866
Who cares who's right or wrong?
I don't need to be right.

296
00:20:34,077 --> 00:20:35,840
So why are you so defensive?

297
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:37,335
I'm not.

298
00:20:37,488 --> 00:20:38,662
Get off my back.

299
00:20:39,361 --> 00:20:40,548
My head hurts.

300
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,755
- Are you hungry?
- A little.

301
00:20:52,025 --> 00:20:53,345
I'll fix you something.

302
00:20:54,134 --> 00:20:55,308
Want a drink?

303
00:20:55,451 --> 00:20:56,566
Whatever.

304
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:59,371
- Tea or coffee?
- Anything. I don't care.

305
00:20:59,785 --> 00:21:00,918
OK.

306
00:21:04,949 --> 00:21:06,716
Can't you walk quieter?

307
00:21:09,608 --> 00:21:10,768
You're unbelievable!

308
00:21:11,489 --> 00:21:12,849
Can't you wear slippers?

309
00:21:13,164 --> 00:21:15,336
You know shoes are noisy.

310
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,138
Of course. I'm sorry.

311
00:21:19,394 --> 00:21:23,224
Don't be so sarcastic,
you know I'm right.

312
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:26,788
I wasn't sarcastic. You are right.

313
00:21:27,192 --> 00:21:28,567
Of course I am.

314
00:21:28,768 --> 00:21:29,868
Of course.

315
00:21:30,261 --> 00:21:32,255
Can't you be careful?

316
00:21:32,608 --> 00:21:34,683
I take so little pleasure in things.

317
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,563
I don't need to live with
someone who gets on my nerves!

318
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:44,363
Here we go. You're never happy.

319
00:21:45,108 --> 00:21:46,958
What's that supposed to mean?

320
00:21:46,983 --> 00:21:49,375
I just asked you to wear slippers.

321
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,181
Shoes are too noisy.
Am I asking too much?

322
00:21:53,698 --> 00:21:55,045
No. I said I'm sorry.

323
00:21:55,678 --> 00:21:56,932
What more do you want?

324
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,972
You're sorry? Did you hear yourself?

325
00:22:02,805 --> 00:22:05,798
Just leave me alone.
You're picking a fight.

326
00:22:07,068 --> 00:22:09,021
Me picking a fight? No way.

327
00:22:09,525 --> 00:22:11,868
I could blow up at you right now,

328
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,173
but I have no desire to.

329
00:22:17,296 --> 00:22:18,717
You're right and I'm wrong.

330
00:22:26,775 --> 00:22:27,938
Leo...

331
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:31,388
Come on, leave me alone.

332
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:41,665
Got cigarettes?

333
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,440
Shit, only one. Here.

334
00:22:45,719 --> 00:22:47,178
You can have it.

335
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,020
No, take it. I'll get more.

336
00:22:51,034 --> 00:22:52,120
Thanks.

337
00:23:09,393 --> 00:23:12,160
Make sure we've got
cigarettes from now on.

338
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:23,275
- Here.
- You keep them.

339
00:23:23,733 --> 00:23:26,101
Must that thing be on all the time?

340
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:27,716
No, of course not.

341
00:23:27,983 --> 00:23:29,940
But I thought you'd like music.

342
00:23:30,103 --> 00:23:33,118
Put the record in its
sleeve so it won't get dusty.

343
00:23:34,233 --> 00:23:35,926
Anyway, the needle is bad.

344
00:23:36,353 --> 00:23:37,946
It was bad before I came.

345
00:23:39,067 --> 00:23:40,193
Before you came?

346
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,487
I rarely used the stereo.

347
00:23:43,358 --> 00:23:45,706
It couldn't have been
bad before you came.

348
00:23:54,853 --> 00:23:57,160
Why is it so cold? Must it be?

349
00:23:58,877 --> 00:24:02,291
I forgot to light the stove.
I didn't know you'd be home.

350
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:06,155
Keep it lit.
You'll get fewer colds, so will I.

351
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:09,515
I catch your colds, and
I'm no good for days.

352
00:24:10,567 --> 00:24:12,887
Sleeping together spreads germs.

353
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,007
You don't have to sleep with me.

354
00:24:17,775 --> 00:24:19,932
That's not what I'm saying.

355
00:24:19,957 --> 00:24:22,475
You know I love sleeping with you.

356
00:24:22,817 --> 00:24:23,931
Oh yeah?

357
00:24:25,455 --> 00:24:27,742
You take everything the wrong way.

358
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:29,755
I'm not asking much.

359
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,948
You could be nicer when I come home.

360
00:24:33,152 --> 00:24:35,547
You could ask me about my day.

361
00:24:36,233 --> 00:24:37,431
How was your day?

362
00:24:37,589 --> 00:24:40,246
Since you asked, I'm a wreck.

363
00:24:42,048 --> 00:24:43,625
I'm filled with anxiety.

364
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,528
I've always got some pain somewhere.

365
00:24:46,951 --> 00:24:49,511
I take pills, then my stomach hurts.

366
00:24:50,108 --> 00:24:51,678
You should see a doctor.

367
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,590
But when? Tomorrow's Sunday.

368
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:56,119
I'm leaving Monday.

369
00:24:56,575 --> 00:24:57,606
So soon?

370
00:24:57,672 --> 00:25:00,958
Yes, of course!
Everything's gotten so difficult.

371
00:25:01,587 --> 00:25:02,931
I can't sell anything.

372
00:25:03,608 --> 00:25:05,932
I don't know, but it seems like

373
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:09,543
since I've known
you, I've lost my touch.

374
00:25:10,513 --> 00:25:11,757
Since you've known me...

375
00:25:11,991 --> 00:25:13,983
Yes. I'm always so anxious.

376
00:25:14,199 --> 00:25:16,693
Running around
with no time to myself.

377
00:25:18,275 --> 00:25:19,461
You're exaggerating.

378
00:25:20,693 --> 00:25:22,615
But you only know me in bed!

379
00:25:23,978 --> 00:25:25,145
Speaking of which...

380
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,571
we're still pretty good in bed, huh?

381
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:30,251
It doesn't get any better.

382
00:25:31,478 --> 00:25:33,398
You like sleeping with me, huh?

383
00:25:34,471 --> 00:25:35,645
Yes, it's true.

384
00:25:37,233 --> 00:25:38,644
You get lots of pleasure?

385
00:25:38,858 --> 00:25:40,253
You could say that.

386
00:25:40,724 --> 00:25:42,946
What is that supposed to mean?

387
00:25:43,811 --> 00:25:45,186
It means yes.

388
00:25:45,395 --> 00:25:47,534
I like making love with you, too.

389
00:25:47,841 --> 00:25:49,541
- You do?
- Of course I do.

390
00:25:49,793 --> 00:25:51,762
I don't want anyone else.

391
00:25:52,492 --> 00:25:54,231
The idea never crosses my mind.

392
00:25:54,256 --> 00:25:56,378
Me neither. No women or other men.

393
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:58,496
I never want another man after you.

394
00:25:59,275 --> 00:26:02,870
What do you mean, after me?
We said we'd be together forever.

395
00:26:03,733 --> 00:26:05,179
Forever is a big word.

396
00:26:05,608 --> 00:26:08,419
Someday you'll find
someone to replace me.

397
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:13,274
I just told you I have no
desire to sleep with other boys.

398
00:26:14,427 --> 00:26:15,893
Maybe not today.

399
00:26:16,853 --> 00:26:19,805
I hate thinking about
it, but I can't help it.

400
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,685
That's your own fault.
I haven't done anything.

401
00:26:25,567 --> 00:26:27,107
How will you leave me?

402
00:26:27,718 --> 00:26:29,320
God, you're complicated.

403
00:26:29,877 --> 00:26:31,551
You get on my nerves.

404
00:26:31,733 --> 00:26:33,144
Oh, fuck this.

405
00:26:34,431 --> 00:26:35,884
Franz...

406
00:26:36,567 --> 00:26:37,911
I'm here.

407
00:26:38,821 --> 00:26:40,915
- Yeah. You're here.
- So?

408
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:45,080
Monday you're gone
again, for a whole week.

409
00:26:51,733 --> 00:26:53,279
What did you do this week?

410
00:26:54,067 --> 00:26:57,386
I cleaned house, did all the laundry,

411
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:59,455
and waxed the floor.

412
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,502
It doesn't show.

413
00:27:02,183 --> 00:27:03,262
Well, I waxed it.

414
00:27:03,442 --> 00:27:04,856
Did you use steel wool?

415
00:27:05,241 --> 00:27:06,850
I didn't know I should.

416
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:09,478
You need steel wool
to get a good shine.

417
00:27:10,275 --> 00:27:11,958
Next time I'll use it.

418
00:27:20,325 --> 00:27:21,545
I got a job.

419
00:27:21,775 --> 00:27:22,932
Oh yeah? Where?

420
00:27:22,993 --> 00:27:24,285
At a publishing house.

421
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:26,940
Doing what?

422
00:27:27,192 --> 00:27:28,702
I'm not sure yet. I'll see.

423
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:32,020
What's your pay?

424
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:36,371
5 marks an hour, but
I set my own hours.

425
00:27:41,449 --> 00:27:42,449
I don't feel well.

426
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,246
Neither do I.

427
00:27:58,705 --> 00:28:00,572
I killed someone, Franz.

428
00:28:02,733 --> 00:28:04,066
- Really?
- Yes.

429
00:28:05,108 --> 00:28:06,354
Not directly.

430
00:28:07,016 --> 00:28:09,114
One of my customers
blew his head off.

431
00:28:10,256 --> 00:28:12,377
You know, the one from Ludwigshafen.

432
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:16,478
All week, I've been
wondering if it's my fault.

433
00:28:18,756 --> 00:28:21,303
I went nuts. I bawled everyone out.

434
00:28:21,942 --> 00:28:23,415
I had visions.

435
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:25,447
There were devils and spirits

436
00:28:26,102 --> 00:28:27,367
laughing at me.

437
00:28:28,942 --> 00:28:32,808
It was like I was someone else,
watching myself from the outside.

438
00:28:34,995 --> 00:28:37,168
I don't know if I'm
responsible for his death.

439
00:28:40,817 --> 00:28:42,130
If the police came,

440
00:28:42,717 --> 00:28:44,030
what would I say?

441
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,173
In this town I didn't know,

442
00:28:49,265 --> 00:28:52,072
it was like everyone
knew I had killed someone.

443
00:28:53,608 --> 00:28:55,441
I felt abandoned,

444
00:28:56,321 --> 00:28:57,321
alone.

445
00:29:00,586 --> 00:29:02,093
Tell me, what should I do?

446
00:29:05,186 --> 00:29:06,453
Say something!

447
00:29:08,215 --> 00:29:09,330
I don't know...

448
00:29:09,595 --> 00:29:10,748
How did it happen?

449
00:29:11,145 --> 00:29:13,551
How did it happen...

450
00:29:13,906 --> 00:29:17,513
I cleaned him out with
the insurance, he must have realized...

451
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:21,508
You're not responsible. It happens.

452
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:24,515
I know I'm not technically
responsible, but

453
00:29:24,775 --> 00:29:26,281
I still feel like a bastard.

454
00:29:26,916 --> 00:29:29,101
He was old, he'd
saved up since the war.

455
00:29:29,858 --> 00:29:32,558
So, he killed himself over money.

456
00:29:33,713 --> 00:29:36,586
But he had nothing else, Franz.

457
00:29:37,088 --> 00:29:38,547
No wife, no children.

458
00:29:39,666 --> 00:29:41,766
You're tired. Let's go to bed.

459
00:29:41,858 --> 00:29:43,319
I can't sleep right now.

460
00:29:44,346 --> 00:29:46,836
It'll be alright, one way or another.

461
00:29:47,181 --> 00:29:48,893
Yeah, one way or another.

462
00:29:51,836 --> 00:29:54,277
We've been together
exactly 6 months today.

463
00:29:54,867 --> 00:29:55,963
Really?

464
00:29:56,757 --> 00:29:58,010
Shall we toast it?

465
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,033
Yes, let's toast it.

466
00:30:20,275 --> 00:30:21,428
Prost.

467
00:30:24,983 --> 00:30:25,983
It's good.

468
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:27,183
Yes, it's good.

469
00:30:34,567 --> 00:30:35,833
I'm a good kisser, huh?

470
00:30:36,145 --> 00:30:37,293
Very good.

471
00:30:37,692 --> 00:30:39,432
Is this how you operate?

472
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:40,770
Sometimes.

473
00:30:41,012 --> 00:30:42,665
I fell for it, didn't I?

474
00:30:44,748 --> 00:30:46,741
Get undressed and go to bed.

475
00:30:48,275 --> 00:30:50,021
I'll wash the glasses
and be right in.

476
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,106
Hello.

477
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:34,473
Is Leopold here, please?

478
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:36,346
Yes, but he's sleeping.

479
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:39,945
He must be tired.

480
00:33:40,166 --> 00:33:42,003
He just returned from Ludwigshafen.

481
00:33:43,094 --> 00:33:44,513
Are you one of his customers?

482
00:33:46,307 --> 00:33:47,467
Sort of.

483
00:33:48,525 --> 00:33:50,325
Want to come in and wait?

484
00:33:52,666 --> 00:33:55,106
You're very kind, thank you.

485
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:57,553
I'll come back.

486
00:33:58,358 --> 00:33:59,858
Want to leave him a message?

487
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:02,664
No, please...

488
00:34:03,472 --> 00:34:05,925
Please don't tell him I was here.

489
00:34:07,233 --> 00:34:08,479
Whatever you say.

490
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,667
Thank you, goodbye.

491
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:29,246
Your bath is ready.

492
00:34:30,614 --> 00:34:31,614
Are you hungry?

493
00:34:31,706 --> 00:34:32,941
Not yet.

494
00:34:33,775 --> 00:34:35,388
Maybe after my bath.

495
00:34:36,339 --> 00:34:37,635
Did you sleep well?

496
00:34:40,067 --> 00:34:43,400
We can't sleep two in that bed.
It's too drafty.

497
00:34:43,777 --> 00:34:45,233
We must do something.

498
00:34:45,733 --> 00:34:47,855
Like find a place without drafts.

499
00:34:48,066 --> 00:34:49,720
You should look for one.

500
00:34:50,173 --> 00:34:52,684
- I know.
- You know, but you don't do it.

501
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,946
You act like it's impossible.

502
00:34:55,442 --> 00:34:57,013
It's not that easy.

503
00:34:57,536 --> 00:34:58,840
Try harder!

504
00:34:59,509 --> 00:35:00,743
I'll find one.

505
00:35:02,313 --> 00:35:04,796
Stop it! I've got to take my bath.

506
00:35:22,692 --> 00:35:24,218
For God's sake!

507
00:35:25,964 --> 00:35:27,162
Shut off the music!

508
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,830
Asshole! Motherfucker!

509
00:35:44,855 --> 00:35:46,597
How can you be so selfish?

510
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,013
I've really had enough!

511
00:35:49,422 --> 00:35:52,388
What am I doing with you?
I should move out!

512
00:35:52,413 --> 00:35:53,693
Bastard!

513
00:36:25,275 --> 00:36:26,708
I wrote you a poem.

514
00:36:28,608 --> 00:36:30,661
I'd like to read it,
but I don't have time.

515
00:36:31,491 --> 00:36:33,881
I need to figure out that damn bill.

516
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:36,018
Obviously.

517
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:40,983
What's that sarcastic
"obviously" supposed to mean?

518
00:36:41,494 --> 00:36:43,569
I have to do this for work.

519
00:36:43,594 --> 00:36:45,854
Don't take it wrong.

520
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:47,971
I haven't.

521
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:50,518
It's funny, you always add something.

522
00:36:51,133 --> 00:36:53,251
You always have
to have the last word.

523
00:37:01,194 --> 00:37:02,755
Do you know where I put it?

524
00:37:03,527 --> 00:37:04,606
No, I don't.

525
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:05,931
Naturally.

526
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,494
"Naturally."

527
00:37:07,708 --> 00:37:10,730
When you need help,
there's never anybody there.

528
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,623
Now that's ridiculous.

529
00:37:14,094 --> 00:37:16,856
It's not ridiculous.
It's just a fact.

530
00:37:17,129 --> 00:37:18,753
Never anybody there...

531
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:20,099
Whatever.

532
00:37:22,168 --> 00:37:23,574
Don't be paranoid.

533
00:37:23,804 --> 00:37:26,254
It's not about you.
It's a general observation.

534
00:37:46,205 --> 00:37:47,372
You find it?

535
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,103
I can't find anything,

536
00:37:49,481 --> 00:37:51,016
it's such a fucking mess!

537
00:37:51,353 --> 00:37:52,656
I didn't touch anything.

538
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:56,896
Then I should be able to find things!
It's like everything's been moved.

539
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:01,058
"The hat goes on the 3rd nail,

540
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:02,303
not the 4th."

541
00:38:02,895 --> 00:38:04,637
That's beside the point!

542
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,988
I should be able to find my things!

543
00:38:07,463 --> 00:38:09,896
But I have never touched your things!

544
00:38:12,275 --> 00:38:15,635
- Why are you so angry?
- I'm not, it's just the truth.

545
00:38:16,029 --> 00:38:19,196
Leave me alone 5 minutes,
go in the other room.

546
00:38:19,395 --> 00:38:22,989
I'd have found that damned
bill, if it wasn't for you!

547
00:38:23,353 --> 00:38:25,840
I could leave for
more than 5 minutes!

548
00:38:26,266 --> 00:38:28,320
- What's that mean?
- You get me.

549
00:38:28,384 --> 00:38:29,582
You want to leave?

550
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,967
Why not.

551
00:38:31,106 --> 00:38:34,487
OK, pick up your shit,
call a taxi and get out now.

552
00:38:34,942 --> 00:38:36,715
I don't need my stuff. You keep it.

553
00:38:37,235 --> 00:38:39,602
No, take it with you, I'm sick of it!

554
00:38:40,653 --> 00:38:41,835
Go on.

555
00:38:54,804 --> 00:38:55,970
Then what?

556
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:57,403
What, then?

557
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:58,950
We'll never see each other again.

558
00:38:59,564 --> 00:39:00,730
How could we?

559
00:39:01,085 --> 00:39:02,656
OK. As you like.

560
00:39:04,567 --> 00:39:07,813
You want to have your
cake and eat it too?

561
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,860
I love you, but that's
asking too much.

562
00:39:11,478 --> 00:39:14,678
Why? We're good together,
we just can't live together.

563
00:39:15,518 --> 00:39:17,292
Think it over for a week.

564
00:39:17,317 --> 00:39:19,791
We'll find a way to work it out.

565
00:39:20,936 --> 00:39:22,756
Right, we'll work it out...

566
00:39:29,817 --> 00:39:31,137
Why are you getting dressed?

567
00:39:31,525 --> 00:39:32,743
Because I'm leaving.

568
00:39:33,223 --> 00:39:34,223
For where?

569
00:39:34,745 --> 00:39:36,325
I don't know and I don't care.

570
00:39:36,879 --> 00:39:38,785
You can't leave like this.

571
00:39:39,942 --> 00:39:41,208
That remains to be seen.

572
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:45,252
OK.

573
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:46,992
Whatever you want.

574
00:39:48,942 --> 00:39:50,088
See you.

575
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:27,251
You don't mind that I'm leaving.

576
00:40:27,743 --> 00:40:29,851
Sure I do, but you don't believe me.

577
00:40:35,983 --> 00:40:38,769
You expect me to
believe you, sitting there

578
00:40:38,856 --> 00:40:40,883
like you don't even care about me.

579
00:40:41,692 --> 00:40:43,978
You know I have to work hard,

580
00:40:44,638 --> 00:40:46,018
or I won't get ahead.

581
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,019
I'm not getting anywhere as it is.

582
00:40:49,718 --> 00:40:51,319
I'm just going backwards.

583
00:40:53,067 --> 00:40:54,473
I can't help you with that.

584
00:41:02,661 --> 00:41:05,881
<i>One day there was something
they couldn't agree on,</i>

585
00:41:07,233 --> 00:41:09,186
<i>a little, unimportant thing,</i>

586
00:41:09,681 --> 00:41:11,030
<i>a difference,</i>

587
00:41:11,692 --> 00:41:15,286
<i>but from then on, there was no
common ground between them,</i>

588
00:41:16,446 --> 00:41:18,180
<i>only differences.</i>

589
00:41:40,321 --> 00:41:41,855
Aren't you working today?

590
00:41:42,855 --> 00:41:44,028
Shit!

591
00:41:45,618 --> 00:41:49,218
Work calms the nerves.
But I'm not going to force you.

592
00:41:49,462 --> 00:41:50,462
Good.

593
00:41:51,985 --> 00:41:55,265
However, I think you could
make an effort to chip in.

594
00:41:56,047 --> 00:41:57,771
With my lousy salary?

595
00:41:58,331 --> 00:42:01,091
I told you how you could
make some pocket money.

596
00:42:01,929 --> 00:42:03,978
Still want me to play whore, do you?

597
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:16,938
Make any food?

598
00:42:26,764 --> 00:42:28,758
Bluhm... Yes.

599
00:42:29,103 --> 00:42:30,831
Who? Yes, he's here.

600
00:42:32,779 --> 00:42:34,125
Phone for you.

601
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:35,273
Here.

602
00:42:35,701 --> 00:42:36,846
A young woman.

603
00:42:40,146 --> 00:42:41,446
Ah, it's you.

604
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:43,353
I'm fine.

605
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:46,468
Yes, that was him.

606
00:42:50,483 --> 00:42:51,649
This week?

607
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,563
Got the address?

608
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,353
OK.

609
00:42:56,676 --> 00:42:57,978
See you soon.

610
00:43:03,305 --> 00:43:05,018
- Who was that?
- Anna.

611
00:43:05,798 --> 00:43:08,252
- What's she want?
- Just to talk.

612
00:43:09,365 --> 00:43:10,907
Can't she talk by phone?

613
00:43:11,904 --> 00:43:14,731
Maybe something's wrong.
Or she just wants to see me.

614
00:43:16,196 --> 00:43:17,275
You don't mind?

615
00:43:18,781 --> 00:43:20,748
Why should I mind?

616
00:43:21,525 --> 00:43:23,035
No reason.

617
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:26,469
You never have a reason.

618
00:43:30,391 --> 00:43:33,538
- Will it be long this time?
- I told you I don't know yet.

619
00:43:34,301 --> 00:43:35,704
It depends on work.

620
00:43:35,996 --> 00:43:38,529
Someone has to bring home the bacon.

621
00:43:43,461 --> 00:43:44,815
Don't I get a kiss?

622
00:43:46,279 --> 00:43:47,548
Sure you do.

623
00:43:53,147 --> 00:43:54,334
Bon voyage.

624
00:45:58,192 --> 00:45:59,525
The door is open.

625
00:46:03,475 --> 00:46:04,742
Franz, are you home?

626
00:46:08,558 --> 00:46:11,065
What's wrong, Franz? You're crying?

627
00:46:11,942 --> 00:46:13,988
What's wrong? I love you.

628
00:46:15,056 --> 00:46:16,748
What do you mean, you love me?

629
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:19,077
Got a cigarette?

630
00:46:21,628 --> 00:46:22,791
Light it.

631
00:46:27,983 --> 00:46:29,721
There's gin in the kitchen.

632
00:46:30,363 --> 00:46:32,136
- Bring two glasses.
- OK.

633
00:46:39,003 --> 00:46:40,236
Prost, Franz.

634
00:46:40,866 --> 00:46:42,009
To us?

635
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:43,996
To us, Anna.

636
00:46:44,871 --> 00:46:46,704
Although there is no more "us".

637
00:46:47,732 --> 00:46:49,058
Why do you say that?

638
00:46:50,212 --> 00:46:51,666
You don't seem happy here.

639
00:46:52,712 --> 00:46:54,972
You're sitting in the dark, crying.

640
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:56,719
Something seems wrong.

641
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,878
That's not true. I'm happy.

642
00:47:00,489 --> 00:47:02,183
Anyway, what is happiness?

643
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:04,683
I don't know.

644
00:47:06,317 --> 00:47:09,232
Being satisfied and calm...
like we were.

645
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:12,736
We never knew happiness, Anna.

646
00:47:13,317 --> 00:47:14,816
We just dreamt about it.

647
00:47:15,563 --> 00:47:17,076
Happiness is something else.

648
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:21,311
Here, I may well have been happy.

649
00:47:23,293 --> 00:47:25,033
At first, everything
was so different.

650
00:47:27,817 --> 00:47:29,357
But maybe it was just a dream.

651
00:47:32,259 --> 00:47:33,586
What happened?

652
00:47:34,233 --> 00:47:35,426
I don't know...

653
00:47:36,192 --> 00:47:38,978
One fine day everything
I did and said was wrong.

654
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,640
He was no longer happy with me.

655
00:47:42,358 --> 00:47:43,447
Why?

656
00:47:44,968 --> 00:47:46,522
Stop asking questions.

657
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:49,428
Tell me about you.

658
00:47:52,192 --> 00:47:53,532
There isn't much to say.

659
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:56,285
Everything is like before.

660
00:48:01,025 --> 00:48:02,158
Almost everything.

661
00:48:02,996 --> 00:48:04,058
Almost?

662
00:48:04,465 --> 00:48:05,771
Yes. Almost.

663
00:48:07,108 --> 00:48:08,328
What's changed?

664
00:48:11,468 --> 00:48:13,861
I've met a man who wants to marry me.

665
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:16,803
Is that why you called me?

666
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:20,950
I wanted to see you
again before I said yes.

667
00:48:23,593 --> 00:48:24,720
Why?

668
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:29,147
Because I love you, not him.

669
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:33,474
Don't say anything, not just yet.

670
00:48:33,692 --> 00:48:34,890
Think about it.

671
00:48:35,127 --> 00:48:36,883
Why should I think about it?

672
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:38,286
I love Leopold.

673
00:48:38,669 --> 00:48:39,879
End of story.

674
00:48:40,957 --> 00:48:42,597
But what about all our plans?

675
00:48:43,719 --> 00:48:45,685
Our children, our house?

676
00:48:46,483 --> 00:48:47,776
That was all bullshit.

677
00:48:48,192 --> 00:48:50,949
No, Franz.
We could have made it, if you...

678
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,816
Anna, you're still dreaming.

679
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:55,063
Marry this man.

680
00:48:55,483 --> 00:48:57,570
Have his children. I'll be godfather.

681
00:48:58,567 --> 00:48:59,767
You're cruel.

682
00:49:00,829 --> 00:49:02,367
Why are you so cruel?

683
00:49:04,067 --> 00:49:06,180
I'm not cruel, just realistic.

684
00:49:11,042 --> 00:49:13,736
We've known each other
exactly 4 years today.

685
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:16,793
What is it?

686
00:49:17,155 --> 00:49:19,773
"We've known each other 4 years...

687
00:49:19,891 --> 00:49:21,387
...we must celebrate."

688
00:49:22,404 --> 00:49:23,551
C'mon Anna,

689
00:49:23,785 --> 00:49:26,084
that's just stupid sentimentality.

690
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:29,523
But we always used to celebrate it.

691
00:49:30,094 --> 00:49:31,227
Really?

692
00:49:31,487 --> 00:49:32,620
I forgot.

693
00:49:33,817 --> 00:49:35,283
Life changes, Anna.

694
00:49:36,442 --> 00:49:37,635
Listen to you.

695
00:49:39,144 --> 00:49:40,348
You've changed.

696
00:49:43,009 --> 00:49:44,389
You, too. You've changed.

697
00:49:45,525 --> 00:49:46,643
For the better.

698
00:49:48,108 --> 00:49:49,814
You're much prettier.

699
00:49:51,093 --> 00:49:52,761
You're just saying that.

700
00:49:54,488 --> 00:49:56,708
Did you enjoy it when we had sex?

701
00:49:57,483 --> 00:49:59,709
Of course I did.

702
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:01,326
Really enjoy it?

703
00:50:02,324 --> 00:50:04,938
I don't know. It depends which times.

704
00:50:11,788 --> 00:50:13,308
I still like you a lot.

705
00:50:16,025 --> 00:50:17,451
Me too, I love you.

706
00:51:17,223 --> 00:51:18,603
What's the matter?

707
00:51:18,983 --> 00:51:20,203
Should something be?

708
00:51:20,482 --> 00:51:22,023
I don't know, you're so quiet.

709
00:51:22,522 --> 00:51:24,015
I don't have anything to say.

710
00:51:25,101 --> 00:51:27,795
Let's talk about how
many kids we'll have.

711
00:51:28,089 --> 00:51:29,821
How many, 5?

712
00:51:30,779 --> 00:51:31,779
No, 2.

713
00:51:32,353 --> 00:51:34,386
2 kids are plenty.

714
00:51:34,951 --> 00:51:36,286
What will we call them?

715
00:51:37,585 --> 00:51:38,985
We'll have 2 boys.

716
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:43,592
They'll be named Franz and
Leopold, Leopold and Franz.

717
00:51:47,496 --> 00:51:49,156
You must stop thinking about him.

718
00:51:49,793 --> 00:51:51,403
We're still at his place.

719
00:51:54,688 --> 00:51:58,208
But today we'll pack
your bags and leave.

720
00:52:08,983 --> 00:52:10,609
- Got any money?
- A little.

721
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:12,563
A little? How much is that?

722
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:15,950
You never used to care about money.

723
00:52:16,212 --> 00:52:17,543
It'll be enough.

724
00:52:18,263 --> 00:52:19,443
If you say so.

725
00:52:20,458 --> 00:52:23,078
We'll look for a place. With 2 rooms.

726
00:52:23,165 --> 00:52:24,165
Again?

727
00:52:24,275 --> 00:52:26,151
Don't worry, I'll handle it.

728
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:30,553
You can read books, go to
the theatre, and tell me about it.

729
00:52:30,909 --> 00:52:32,487
Anna, you're dreaming again.

730
00:52:33,196 --> 00:52:35,283
You know reality is always different.

731
00:52:40,529 --> 00:52:41,529
Why?

732
00:52:41,663 --> 00:52:44,683
Because I'll have to find a real job.

733
00:52:45,358 --> 00:52:47,599
But I've already got a real job.

734
00:52:47,859 --> 00:52:49,401
What've you told them?

735
00:52:50,811 --> 00:52:52,444
I'm on vacation for another 2 weeks.

736
00:52:52,858 --> 00:52:54,904
I have to work all
summer to make it up.

737
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:01,004
We went to Greece last summer.

738
00:53:03,275 --> 00:53:04,604
That's over now.

739
00:53:06,567 --> 00:53:09,900
Next time you go to
Greece, it'll be with me.

740
00:53:10,983 --> 00:53:12,127
I guess so.

741
00:54:06,209 --> 00:54:07,650
What should I do about Leopold?

742
00:54:09,161 --> 00:54:11,128
I must see him and
explain everything.

743
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:13,348
What for?

744
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:17,830
Write him a letter, tell him it
was great, but now it's over.

745
00:54:19,067 --> 00:54:20,580
Yes, I'll write him a letter.

746
00:54:22,733 --> 00:54:24,533
But when he comes home Saturday night

747
00:54:25,468 --> 00:54:27,539
it'll be cold here, he'll be alone.

748
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:30,151
So? That's what he wants, isn't it?

749
00:54:31,733 --> 00:54:33,173
Yeah, that's what he wants.

750
00:54:34,221 --> 00:54:37,259
Now, let's get dressed.
We've got a lot to do.

751
00:54:51,233 --> 00:54:53,073
I'd like to stay in
the bedroom awhile.

752
00:54:53,913 --> 00:54:55,006
Of course.

753
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:56,604
Don't take it badly.

754
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:59,004
It's just I liked it here.

755
00:54:59,562 --> 00:55:00,849
I'm not saying anything.

756
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:02,683
I understand completely.

757
00:55:06,073 --> 00:55:08,293
It's not easy for
me to leave like this.

758
00:55:09,301 --> 00:55:10,620
Alone, I never could have.

759
00:55:12,413 --> 00:55:13,893
But now we're together,

760
00:55:14,646 --> 00:55:15,810
and we'll make it.

761
00:55:15,835 --> 00:55:17,693
Yes, we'll make it...

762
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,191
What's wrong?

763
00:55:22,693 --> 00:55:24,307
Didn't we agree to leave?

764
00:55:24,586 --> 00:55:25,800
Yes, it's OK.

765
00:55:26,183 --> 00:55:28,559
I just want to stay a bit longer.

766
00:55:29,256 --> 00:55:31,582
- Is that too much to ask?
- No, it's alright.

767
00:55:35,417 --> 00:55:37,051
- You know?
- What?

768
00:55:38,431 --> 00:55:40,018
I think I still love him.

769
00:55:43,108 --> 00:55:45,188
I think I love him a lot.

770
00:55:45,523 --> 00:55:47,961
But you know it won't
work in the long run!

771
00:55:49,192 --> 00:55:50,458
Put on a record.

772
00:55:50,817 --> 00:55:51,817
Which one?

773
00:55:51,983 --> 00:55:53,178
You know the one.

774
00:55:53,669 --> 00:55:54,914
Obviously...

775
00:57:21,786 --> 00:57:23,479
Franz, someone's at the door!

776
00:57:30,771 --> 00:57:31,771
Hello, Madam.

777
00:57:39,782 --> 00:57:40,782
You alright?

778
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,120
It's nothing, excuse me.

779
00:57:52,523 --> 00:57:54,143
I got the wrong door.

780
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:56,403
It's OK.

781
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:02,903
It was a mistake!

782
00:58:05,282 --> 00:58:06,740
What's wrong now?

783
00:58:08,468 --> 00:58:09,862
You're crying again...

784
00:58:11,132 --> 00:58:12,978
You've got to forget him.

785
00:58:13,216 --> 00:58:14,625
It isn't so easy!

786
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:15,704
But you must.

787
00:58:16,053 --> 00:58:17,642
We've got to start over.

788
00:58:26,733 --> 00:58:27,896
Someone's here.

789
00:58:35,728 --> 00:58:37,938
- My God!
- What is it, Miss?

790
00:58:38,176 --> 00:58:39,207
Uh, nothing.

791
00:58:39,439 --> 00:58:40,774
You're back already?

792
00:58:41,801 --> 00:58:43,835
Aren't you glad to see me?

793
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:45,341
Sure I am.

794
00:58:45,876 --> 00:58:46,876
Introduce us!

795
00:58:48,056 --> 00:58:49,056
Mr. Bluhm,

796
00:58:50,103 --> 00:58:51,838
meet Anna I've told you about...

797
00:58:52,063 --> 00:58:54,434
Hello. We were just moving out.

798
00:58:56,409 --> 00:58:57,929
That's a good one!

799
00:58:59,618 --> 00:59:00,993
Make some coffee, Franz.

800
00:59:31,942 --> 00:59:33,835
Come sit next to me, Miss.

801
00:59:37,177 --> 00:59:39,090
Perhaps I should get dressed?

802
00:59:39,317 --> 00:59:40,910
That won't be necessary.

803
00:59:41,302 --> 00:59:43,521
You're perfectly lovely as you are.

804
00:59:43,942 --> 00:59:46,128
Wow, you've got an eye for that, too?

805
00:59:46,442 --> 00:59:47,448
Why not?

806
00:59:47,628 --> 00:59:50,175
- I just thought...
- So Franz wants to move?

807
00:59:50,317 --> 00:59:52,088
Yes. We're getting married.

808
00:59:52,151 --> 00:59:53,151
Oh?

809
00:59:53,511 --> 00:59:55,504
You think Franz is the marrying kind?

810
00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:56,817
Why not?

811
00:59:57,433 --> 00:59:58,758
Tell me, dear Anna,

812
01:00:00,192 --> 01:00:01,578
do you love Franz?

813
01:00:02,518 --> 01:00:03,985
Why shouldn't I love him?

814
01:00:04,384 --> 01:00:05,678
He's still very young.

815
01:00:06,266 --> 01:00:08,099
Is that a reason not to love him?

816
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:10,683
Of course not.

817
01:00:11,931 --> 01:00:13,156
On the contrary.

818
01:00:33,692 --> 01:00:36,145
Thank you. Would you serve us please?

819
01:00:38,578 --> 01:00:40,038
So, you want to move?

820
01:00:41,656 --> 01:00:42,771
Why only now?

821
01:00:42,983 --> 01:00:44,296
Why not "only now"?

822
01:00:44,567 --> 01:00:47,816
You wouldn't have left
without saying goodbye?

823
01:00:48,301 --> 01:00:49,356
Who knows?

824
01:00:49,773 --> 01:00:50,935
I know.

825
01:00:53,045 --> 01:00:54,218
I'll get it.

826
01:01:00,733 --> 01:01:03,573
Leo, Helmut left me.

827
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:07,159
Excuse me, I don't
know you, who are you?

828
01:01:08,058 --> 01:01:10,911
Leo, it's me, Vera.

829
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:13,911
Vera, my dear!

830
01:01:15,108 --> 01:01:16,748
My God, how you've aged.

831
01:01:17,891 --> 01:01:20,425
You never said he
was so sexy for his age.

832
01:01:20,546 --> 01:01:22,011
Now I understand.

833
01:01:22,421 --> 01:01:24,128
So go fuck him, slut.

834
01:01:25,275 --> 01:01:26,668
Anna, Franz,

835
01:01:27,127 --> 01:01:29,021
this is Vera, an old friend.

836
01:01:29,942 --> 01:01:31,255
I mean a former buddy

837
01:01:32,275 --> 01:01:34,135
who cut his dick off in Casablanca.

838
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:36,806
Hello, Madam.

839
01:01:40,277 --> 01:01:41,308
Hello.

840
01:01:41,333 --> 01:01:45,783
Excuse me, you're the woman
who put up with Leo 7 years?

841
01:01:47,087 --> 01:01:48,827
If it had been up to me,

842
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:51,451
we'd still be together today.

843
01:01:52,235 --> 01:01:54,088
Vera loves to be tied down,

844
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:57,088
especially by the hands and feet.

845
01:01:57,567 --> 01:01:59,461
Always willing to be displayed,

846
01:01:59,672 --> 01:02:01,081
mauled...

847
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:03,786
isn't that right?

848
01:02:04,299 --> 01:02:05,926
You too, huh, Franz?

849
01:02:07,498 --> 01:02:10,138
- Want to humiliate us?
- Unbelievable!

850
01:02:10,163 --> 01:02:12,985
Instead of being happy
to see me, you moan.

851
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:16,363
Don't worry, we're leaving. Anna?

852
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:18,447
I want to stay awhile.

853
01:02:18,941 --> 01:02:20,900
The situation is so exciting!

854
01:02:22,209 --> 01:02:23,816
Fine, I'll go alone.

855
01:02:23,983 --> 01:02:26,082
What's wrong, Franz?

856
01:02:27,371 --> 01:02:28,977
Not happy I'm back early?

857
01:02:29,624 --> 01:02:31,951
If you only knew how happy I am.

858
01:02:32,150 --> 01:02:34,722
Don't be angry, my little man.

859
01:02:34,962 --> 01:02:38,255
Try to behave in front of
my old friend Vera, please.

860
01:02:39,794 --> 01:02:42,641
Thrilled to make this
dear lady's acquaintance.

861
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:44,815
Franz, be nice.

862
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:47,338
Why be nice? I don't get it.

863
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:49,275
You're all so bizarre,

864
01:02:49,483 --> 01:02:52,566
like puppets, manipulated
by God knows who!

865
01:02:55,670 --> 01:02:56,977
Franz loves me.

866
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:02,573
Deep down he is crazy about me.

867
01:03:02,688 --> 01:03:04,540
I'm crazy about him!

868
01:03:05,426 --> 01:03:06,733
Tell him just how crazy.

869
01:03:07,148 --> 01:03:10,064
We've made love
for two days straight.

870
01:03:10,233 --> 01:03:11,773
We got lots of pleasure.

871
01:03:11,942 --> 01:03:14,419
Naturally. I've taught him well.

872
01:03:14,517 --> 01:03:16,119
You should thank me.

873
01:03:16,897 --> 01:03:18,355
Oh, I do thank you.

874
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:22,290
I'm eternally grateful.
Aren't I, Franz?

875
01:03:22,315 --> 01:03:23,770
- Yes!
- Leopold!

876
01:03:24,192 --> 01:03:25,385
Yes, my dear?

877
01:03:26,544 --> 01:03:28,565
I need to talk to you alone.

878
01:03:28,922 --> 01:03:30,542
Hold on a minute,

879
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,795
wait your turn.

880
01:03:35,483 --> 01:03:37,029
Nice game you've got going.

881
01:03:38,442 --> 01:03:40,849
Unfortunately, I
didn't win on purpose.

882
01:03:41,483 --> 01:03:42,829
A little diversion...

883
01:03:43,207 --> 01:03:44,229
for four.

884
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:47,893
You disgust me.

885
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:51,587
Near the closet are...

886
01:03:51,671 --> 01:03:53,493
Your slippers? I'll get them.

887
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:56,098
Leo's nice little slippers.

888
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,500
There you go taking it badly again.

889
01:03:59,558 --> 01:04:01,265
I'm not taking it badly.

890
01:04:01,442 --> 01:04:03,398
- Sure you're not.
- I'm not.

891
01:04:03,608 --> 01:04:04,853
I know.

892
01:04:05,066 --> 01:04:07,722
- How do you say it?
- How it's said!

893
01:04:08,858 --> 01:04:11,395
Girls, I'm hungry! Fix me something.

894
01:04:11,608 --> 01:04:13,000
- What?
- Some beer?

895
01:04:13,025 --> 01:04:15,424
Hop to it! Whatever, a snack...

896
01:04:17,263 --> 01:04:18,543
Check the fridge.

897
01:04:19,117 --> 01:04:20,776
Was it a good week?

898
01:04:23,134 --> 01:04:25,474
I mean, was there another suicide?

899
01:04:27,995 --> 01:04:29,868
Oh, that's too bad.

900
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,855
Why is it so cold here?

901
01:04:32,317 --> 01:04:33,645
The stove's not lit.

902
01:04:33,884 --> 01:04:36,123
So light it. God, it's obvious.

903
01:04:36,203 --> 01:04:37,677
I'm not asking much.

904
01:04:38,025 --> 01:04:39,418
So do it yourself.

905
01:04:39,877 --> 01:04:41,525
Here's a little sandwich.

906
01:04:42,282 --> 01:04:44,585
Put it down there. Give me the beer.

907
01:04:46,817 --> 01:04:48,410
Can I put on a record?

908
01:06:03,942 --> 01:06:05,104
That's enough!

909
01:06:11,150 --> 01:06:12,490
Everyone in the bedroom.

910
01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:22,790
Aren't you coming?

911
01:06:23,567 --> 01:06:24,796
You need me?

912
01:06:26,317 --> 01:06:27,570
You need me!

913
01:06:29,286 --> 01:06:30,406
I'll be right there.

914
01:06:50,417 --> 01:06:52,617
<i>I know not if there is a reason</i>

915
01:06:53,537 --> 01:06:55,423
<i>Why I am so sad at heart.</i>

916
01:06:56,910 --> 01:06:59,043
<i>A legend of bygone ages</i>

917
01:07:00,490 --> 01:07:02,670
<i>Haunts me and will not depart.</i>

918
01:07:04,703 --> 01:07:07,316
<i>The air is cool under nightfall.</i>

919
01:07:07,341 --> 01:07:09,616
<i>The calm Rhine courses its way.</i>

920
01:09:28,911 --> 01:09:30,498
You're wearing my coat.

921
01:09:31,712 --> 01:09:33,004
I was cold.

922
01:09:35,827 --> 01:09:37,101
Why are you crying?

923
01:09:39,115 --> 01:09:40,381
Because I'm unhappy.

924
01:09:46,218 --> 01:09:47,432
Not fucking anymore?

925
01:09:47,799 --> 01:09:50,698
I'm fed up.
He's only interested in her.

926
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:53,423
Fresh flesh wins out.

927
01:09:53,903 --> 01:09:55,977
He never would've
done this to me before.

928
01:09:57,917 --> 01:09:59,663
Before he was very different.

929
01:10:00,912 --> 01:10:02,619
10 years have passed,

930
01:10:02,837 --> 01:10:06,193
I just got dumped, he doesn't care.
Can you understand that?

931
01:10:06,817 --> 01:10:08,510
No, I don't understand, either.

932
01:10:11,299 --> 01:10:13,686
I've suffered in
every way imaginable.

933
01:10:15,058 --> 01:10:16,338
So much sadness.

934
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:20,841
Even after all these years?

935
01:10:22,023 --> 01:10:23,670
I'll suffer forever.

936
01:10:25,808 --> 01:10:27,448
Can't you forget him?

937
01:10:31,317 --> 01:10:33,210
How could I forget him?

938
01:10:35,891 --> 01:10:37,251
Even with the others,

939
01:10:38,113 --> 01:10:39,951
I think of him.

940
01:10:41,536 --> 01:10:42,969
I'm his creature.

941
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:46,093
How so?

942
01:10:48,567 --> 01:10:50,213
When I met Leopold,

943
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,840
I had just come to Germany.

944
01:10:53,404 --> 01:10:57,798
I was like you: young,
innocent, and most of all, lost.

945
01:10:58,150 --> 01:10:59,498
Starved for love.

946
01:11:02,648 --> 01:11:04,441
He taught me everything about sex.

947
01:11:08,442 --> 01:11:09,835
It was wonderful.

948
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:15,853
He was so good,

949
01:11:17,023 --> 01:11:20,646
he made me feel like I
existed for the very first time.

950
01:11:22,633 --> 01:11:23,980
I was happy.

951
01:11:27,301 --> 01:11:29,868
That is, until he stopped desiring me.

952
01:11:33,765 --> 01:11:35,458
He touched me less and less.

953
01:11:38,608 --> 01:11:40,221
Everything changed.

954
01:11:41,108 --> 01:11:42,634
It was unbearable.

955
01:11:48,661 --> 01:11:51,401
So, I took a drastic measure,

956
01:11:52,483 --> 01:11:53,701
crazy,

957
01:11:54,745 --> 01:11:56,018
crazy with love...

958
01:11:57,681 --> 01:11:59,228
He'd once said to me,

959
01:11:59,567 --> 01:12:02,634
"If you were a woman
I'd have married you."

960
01:12:07,275 --> 01:12:09,201
I had a sex change for him,

961
01:12:10,551 --> 01:12:11,998
out of love for him,

962
01:12:13,038 --> 01:12:14,697
so he'd want me again.

963
01:12:18,308 --> 01:12:20,795
I was a boy and I became a woman.

964
01:12:21,516 --> 01:12:23,275
I spent all my savings.

965
01:12:25,455 --> 01:12:28,408
For awhile, his desire was revived.

966
01:12:29,641 --> 01:12:30,981
It was the newness...

967
01:12:31,252 --> 01:12:32,601
I deluded myself.

968
01:12:36,003 --> 01:12:37,936
Then the desire died again.

969
01:12:42,025 --> 01:12:43,585
He made me a whore.

970
01:12:44,538 --> 01:12:45,818
Then he left me.

971
01:12:49,029 --> 01:12:50,583
You still love Leopold?

972
01:13:04,049 --> 01:13:05,196
Me too.

973
01:13:06,098 --> 01:13:07,629
In the true sense of the word...

974
01:13:09,182 --> 01:13:10,356
I love him.

975
01:13:24,266 --> 01:13:25,913
How do I look to you?

976
01:13:27,161 --> 01:13:29,039
I don't know. Not bad.

977
01:13:31,301 --> 01:13:32,428
Thanks.

978
01:13:33,953 --> 01:13:35,594
I'm not too old for you?

979
01:13:36,192 --> 01:13:37,674
No, you're still beautiful.

980
01:13:39,723 --> 01:13:40,876
Well...

981
01:13:41,358 --> 01:13:44,343
Maybe we could try
something together.

982
01:13:45,457 --> 01:13:46,617
It's too late.

983
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:49,517
Why?

984
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:51,579
I took some poison.

985
01:13:53,258 --> 01:13:54,372
Really?

986
01:13:55,870 --> 01:13:57,710
- But why?
- Why not?

987
01:14:00,359 --> 01:14:01,646
You're so pale!

988
01:14:02,969 --> 01:14:04,559
Go get me the telephone.

989
01:14:20,587 --> 01:14:22,513
Mum? It's me.

990
01:14:25,025 --> 01:14:26,418
I took some poison.

991
01:14:30,067 --> 01:14:31,420
Nothing can be done.

992
01:14:32,817 --> 01:14:34,667
There's no point in coming.

993
01:14:37,817 --> 01:14:39,897
Maybe I'll go to heaven,
since I'm so young.

994
01:14:44,942 --> 01:14:46,108
Thanks, Mum.

995
01:14:51,108 --> 01:14:52,768
What did your mother say?

996
01:14:53,942 --> 01:14:55,108
Bon voyage.

997
01:14:56,751 --> 01:14:58,173
She has no heart.

998
01:14:58,198 --> 01:15:00,558
She does, but just
in the right place.

999
01:15:02,317 --> 01:15:05,290
Now let me die in peace.
Is that too much to ask?

1000
01:15:06,358 --> 01:15:07,784
You sound like Leopold.

1001
01:15:08,983 --> 01:15:10,249
That's no surprise.

1002
01:15:11,108 --> 01:15:12,549
I'm his creature, too.

1003
01:15:26,150 --> 01:15:27,478
Do you like your job?

1004
01:15:27,625 --> 01:15:28,849
Not much.

1005
01:15:29,544 --> 01:15:30,954
How much do you make?

1006
01:15:31,223 --> 01:15:33,014
It depends. Not a lot.

1007
01:15:33,150 --> 01:15:35,098
Would you like to earn more?

1008
01:15:37,325 --> 01:15:39,696
I know an easy way to make money.

1009
01:15:40,233 --> 01:15:41,991
You'll need to work for me.

1010
01:15:42,567 --> 01:15:44,013
Why not?

1011
01:15:44,466 --> 01:15:46,374
Like a little spanking?

1012
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:49,358
Here we go.

1013
01:16:18,067 --> 01:16:19,380
He's really dead.

1014
01:16:22,108 --> 01:16:23,208
So young...

1015
01:16:39,284 --> 01:16:41,197
Come here, please!

1016
01:16:50,914 --> 01:16:51,914
Now what?

1017
01:16:55,817 --> 01:16:57,297
Your friend is dead.

1018
01:16:58,025 --> 01:16:59,031
Franz?

1019
01:16:59,196 --> 01:17:01,098
No, he's just being melodramatic.

1020
01:17:04,692 --> 01:17:05,812
He's not.

1021
01:17:18,045 --> 01:17:20,238
He's dead. You're right.

1022
01:17:20,983 --> 01:17:23,458
This is horrible. What will we do?

1023
01:17:24,233 --> 01:17:25,759
There's nothing we can do.

1024
01:17:26,817 --> 01:17:27,999
You killed him?

1025
01:17:28,353 --> 01:17:30,906
Me? What are you talking about?

1026
01:17:31,067 --> 01:17:33,852
You disturbed him.
He could've lived to 80,

1027
01:17:34,775 --> 01:17:35,890
or at least 70.

1028
01:17:36,108 --> 01:17:37,353
What's going on?

1029
01:17:39,604 --> 01:17:40,611
He's dead.

1030
01:17:40,858 --> 01:17:41,938
Who?

1031
01:17:45,233 --> 01:17:46,433
My God!

1032
01:17:50,843 --> 01:17:54,043
- Calm down.
- Who'll father my children?

1033
01:17:54,233 --> 01:17:56,688
Little Franz and Leopold...

1034
01:17:57,817 --> 01:18:00,043
Go back to bed. I'll be right in.

1035
01:18:57,464 --> 01:19:00,098
Hello, my dear lady. Bluhm speaking.

1036
01:19:00,775 --> 01:19:02,258
Sorry to bother you.

1037
01:19:03,567 --> 01:19:04,807
Your son is dead.

1038
01:19:06,192 --> 01:19:07,525
Oh, you already knew.

1039
01:19:08,983 --> 01:19:10,125
Well...

1040
01:19:11,483 --> 01:19:12,496
What?

1041
01:19:12,670 --> 01:19:14,283
No, that's no problem for me.

1042
01:19:15,192 --> 01:19:16,369
Not at all.

1043
01:19:18,025 --> 01:19:19,478
Sorry for disturbing you.

1044
01:19:20,415 --> 01:19:21,662
Goodbye, Madam.

1045
01:19:23,233 --> 01:19:25,557
I want to go, there's a corpse here.

1046
01:19:25,768 --> 01:19:26,886
I know.

1047
01:19:27,775 --> 01:19:29,941
We must call the police, and then...

1048
01:19:30,817 --> 01:19:32,843
I'd like to get my coat back.

1049
01:19:33,150 --> 01:19:34,523
We'll do that later.

1050
01:19:35,192 --> 01:19:37,305
Get undressed and
come join us in bed.

1051
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:41,428
I'll wash my hands and be right in.

1052
01:19:41,844 --> 01:19:43,288
You don't need me.

1053
01:19:45,067 --> 01:19:46,333
You need me.
