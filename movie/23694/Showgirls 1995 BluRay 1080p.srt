00:13:07,556 --> 00:13:08,523
多風度翩翩
He's so smooth

143
00:13:09,658 --> 00:13:11,091
請笑納，姬小姐
Your bouquet, Miss Connors

144
00:13:11,426 --> 00:13:13,018
拍照後收下，行嗎？
Can l keep them?

145
00:13:13,862 --> 00:13:17,662
採訪完畢！十分感謝各位
Okay, that's it! Thank you very much for coming. Thanks

146
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,595
這邊來
This way, Cristal

147
00:13:19,668 --> 00:13:21,260
應該送玫瑰給我
They could have gotten me roses

148
00:13:22,404 --> 00:13:23,894
她多出色，對嗎？
She's great, isn't she?

149
00:13:24,306 --> 00:13:25,330
不算差勁
She doesn't suck

150
00:13:25,473 --> 00:13:27,600
姬絲桃找你
Molly! Cristal needs you

151
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:28,506
跟我來
Come with me

152
00:13:29,144 --> 00:13:31,669
充當我的助手，來
You can be my assistant. Come on

153
00:13:41,523 --> 00:13:42,956
姬小姐
Yes, Miss Connors?

154
00:13:43,758 --> 00:13:45,350
叫我姬絲桃吧
Cristal, please. And you are? l'm sorry

155
00:13:47,596 --> 00:13:48,961
我叫慕莉
Molly Abrams

156
00:13:49,064 --> 00:13:52,431
胸圍太緊，壓扁我的乳房
This top is too tight My breasts are getting crushed

157
00:13:52,801 --> 00:13:54,166
我替你放鬆
l can loosen it for you

158
00:13:55,036 --> 00:13:58,267
這處放鬆點，別太松
To here, maybe. No, a little less

159
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:02,401
乳頭要罩得穩，以免波濤洶湧
l want my nipples to press, not look like they're levitating

160
00:14:03,845 --> 00:14:05,142
謝謝你，親愛的
Thanks, darling

161
00:14:12,954 --> 00:14:17,084
你今晚的演出很精彩，姬…小姐
You were really great tonight, Miss... Cristal

162
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:18,990
過獎
Thanks, darling

163
00:14:20,462 --> 00:14:22,953
這些花是安德魯送的？
Andrew Carver sent you these?

164
00:14:23,064 --> 00:14:25,464
既然咭片上是這樣寫
lf that's what the card says

165
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:27,764
我喜歡安德魯
l just love him

166
00:14:28,803 --> 00:14:32,398
我朋友娜美，舞蹈藝員 是嗎？
This is my friend Nomi. She's a dancer. ls she now?

167
00:14:32,774 --> 00:14:34,469
很有天份
Yes, and she's really good

168
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,136
在哪裡跳舞？
Where do you dance, darling?

169
00:14:38,513 --> 00:14:40,105
在獵豹會所
At the Cheetah

170
00:14:41,716 --> 00:14:45,777
我不知你本領多高、有什麼本領
l don't know how good you are, or what it is you're good at...

171
00:14:46,121 --> 00:14:49,989
但在獵豹的話，你肯定不是跳舞
but if it's at the Cheetah, it's no dancing, l know that

172
00:14:51,926 --> 00:14:53,450
你知個屁！
You don't know shit!

173
00:14:56,564 --> 00:14:58,998
對不起，姬小姐
l'm sorry, Miss Connors

174
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:00,967
叫我姬絲桃
''Cristal''

175
00:15:02,237 --> 00:15:03,499
已吩咐過你
l told you

176
00:15:04,072 --> 00:15:05,437
姬絲桃
Cristal

177
00:15:06,207 --> 00:15:08,107
你朋友的指甲不錯
Your friend has nice nails

178
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,943
她自己修甲
She does them herself

179
00:15:11,212 --> 00:15:13,680
也許叫她替我修
Maybe she can do mine sometime

180
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,351
我在這裡幹活
l work here, okay?

181
00:15:23,558 --> 00:15:27,595
不想惹她生氣，打破飯碗
l need my paycheck l don't want her pissed at me

182
00:15:27,595 --> 00:15:28,562
對不起
l'm sorry!

183
00:15:32,934 --> 00:15:34,367
對不起
l'm sorry!

184
00:15:34,436 --> 00:15:35,869
離譜
Jesus, Nomi

185
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:45,041
我載你上班
l'll drive you to work, okay?

186
00:15:45,347 --> 00:15:46,439
不上班
l'm not going

187
00:15:46,748 --> 00:15:47,908
不怕革職？
They'll fire you

188
00:15:49,017 --> 00:15:50,541
無所謂
l don't care

189
00:15:50,618 --> 00:15:52,518
有所謂  無所謂
Yes, you do. No, l don't

190
00:15:56,024 --> 00:15:58,584
我們去吧
Let's go

191
00:15:59,794 --> 00:16:00,761
去哪裡？
Where?

192
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,195
還有哪裡？
You know where

193
00:16:30,191 --> 00:16:31,715
她跳得不錯
She can dance, can't she?

194
00:16:32,093 --> 00:16:33,492
她自以為不錯
She thinks she can

195
00:16:36,798 --> 00:16:38,322
我去跟她跳
l'm gonna go dance with her

196
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:43,467
上班時間跳舞？不怕老闆？
You can't do that. You're working! T.C. will have your ass!

197
00:16:43,772 --> 00:16:45,865
老闆在河畔酒店賭骰子
T.C.'s at the Riviera, playing craps

198
00:16:48,042 --> 00:16:50,169
想跳舞嗎？  我在跳舞
Want to dance? l am dancing!

199
00:16:50,845 --> 00:16:53,405
想跟我跳嗎？  你跳得好？
You want to dance with me? Are you good?

200
00:16:54,182 --> 00:16:56,207
我跳得好
Yeah, l'm good

201
00:16:56,618 --> 00:16:58,085
我買飲品去
l'm going to get a drink

202
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:22,373
你懂得跳  我沒吹牛
You can dance l don't lie

203
00:17:23,344 --> 00:17:24,333
你不懂
You can't

204
00:17:25,313 --> 00:17:26,302
那我在幹什麼？
Then what am l doing?

205
00:17:28,616 --> 00:17:30,083
挑逗我的細佬
Teasing my dick

206
00:17:30,518 --> 00:17:32,383
你有潛質，我願教你
You got potential. l could teach you

207
00:17:40,795 --> 00:17:42,820
不算挑逗吧？
l'm not teasing it now, am l?

208
00:17:43,031 --> 00:17:43,759
當心！
Watch it!

209
00:17:44,699 --> 00:17:45,996
冷靜點
Be cool

210
00:17:46,067 --> 00:17:47,534
你才去冷靜！
You be cool, buddy!

211
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:03,016
娜美！
Nomi!

212
00:18:04,285 --> 00:18:06,048
抓著她！
Hey, you! Hold her!

213
00:18:06,621 --> 00:18:07,053
幹什麼？
What are you doing?

214
00:18:07,121 --> 00:18:09,555
是她惹起的  去死！
She started it! Fuck you!

215
00:18:09,624 --> 00:18:10,648
你玩完
Party's over

216
00:18:13,495 --> 00:18:15,520
娜美
Malone

217
00:18:16,331 --> 00:18:17,662
你可以走
You're out of here

218
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:20,861
保釋文件
Your release papers

219
00:18:20,969 --> 00:18:22,231
如何？
Yo, what's up?

220
00:18:23,238 --> 00:18:26,230
我保釋你出來，咖啡也不請喝？
l bailed you out! Don't that get me a cup of coffee?

221
00:18:28,176 --> 00:18:30,337
我只提議教你跳舞
All l said was l'd teach you to dance

222
00:18:30,411 --> 00:18:32,208
誰要你教？
l don't need to be taught that

223
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,741
故此你想對我說：滾蛋，賤種！
Because you're a bad-ass, saying, ''Back off, motherfucker''

224
00:18:36,818 --> 00:18:38,080
對了
You got that down

225
00:18:38,486 --> 00:18:39,976
滾蛋，賤種！
Back off, motherfucker!

226
00:18:44,058 --> 00:18:47,516
你害得我頭又痛、細佬又痛…
Know what? My head hurts, my dick hurts...

227
00:18:47,862 --> 00:18:49,591
連飯碗也丟掉
and you got me fired from my job!

228
00:18:49,964 --> 00:18:51,226
認命吧
Shit happens

229
00:18:51,432 --> 00:18:55,368
“認命吧”你只贈我一句警句？
''Shit happens.'' That's what l get? Fucking wisdom?

230
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:58,462
沒有其他？  對，只有警句
That's it?! Yeah, you get wisdom

231
00:18:58,873 --> 00:19:03,640
你不僅要我捱打，也要我受氣
You're not just a pain in my head and my dick, you're a pain in my ass

232
00:19:04,045 --> 00:19:05,273
做人難，知嗎？
Life sucks, you know?

233
00:19:05,346 --> 00:19:08,907
做人難，認命吧，T恤的標語？
''Life sucks.'' ''Shit happens'' Where you get this, off T-shirts?

234
00:19:12,287 --> 00:19:13,777
我只求你請喝咖啡
All l want is a cup of coffee Yeah?

235
00:19:18,326 --> 00:19:19,793
有兩毛半嗎？
You got a quarter?

236
00:19:21,796 --> 00:19:23,127
自己去買一杯
Buy yourself a cup

237
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,764
阿爾很生氣，說你再曠工的話…
Al is pissed! He says if you miss another night...

238
00:19:30,138 --> 00:19:32,800
你怎出來？  他替我保釋
How did you get out? He bailed me out

239
00:19:33,374 --> 00:19:34,238
為什麼？
Why?

240
00:19:34,976 --> 00:19:36,204
我踢過他祠堂
l kicked him in the nuts

241
00:19:36,544 --> 00:19:39,138
他喜歡你踢？  必定喜歡
He liked it? He must have

242
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,277
娜美…
Nomi...

243
00:19:44,986 --> 00:19:47,682
我的奶子有脹大嗎？
Nomi, do my boobs look bigger to you?

244
00:19:48,489 --> 00:19:50,855
嘉米懷疑自己又懷孕
Carmi thinks she's pregnant again

245
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:53,389
你又停經？
Girl, you missed your period again?

246
00:19:53,828 --> 00:19:56,422
不知道，似乎沒停過
l don't know. l don't think so

247
00:19:56,531 --> 00:19:59,227
大批日本客殺到！
lt's like a Japanese convention out there!

248
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:00,556
唏，媽咪！
Hey, Mama!

249
00:20:01,636 --> 00:20:04,070
準備好有味笑話沒有？
Better get your ''little weenie'' jokes ready

250
00:20:05,406 --> 00:20:08,898
機關又失靈，幫幫忙
This thing ain't working again. Come on!

251
00:20:08,977 --> 00:20:10,001
給我拍一拍
Here we go. Come on

252
00:20:10,078 --> 00:20:13,013
加把勁，再拍一拍！
One more time. Try harder. Harder!

253
00:20:14,248 --> 00:20:15,146
讓我試試
Let me try it

254
00:20:22,056 --> 00:20:23,648
這位是喜望
l want you to meet Hope

255
00:20:24,826 --> 00:20:28,284
規矩點，這位是蝶芬妮…
Cut it out. Hope, this is Tiffany...

256
00:20:28,396 --> 00:20:31,297
花拉、希迪、亨莉…
Farrah, Heather, Henrietta...

257
00:20:31,366 --> 00:20:33,857
我叫小仙，不是喜望
My name isn't Hope My name is Penny

258
00:20:38,406 --> 00:20:41,500
小仙不好聽，引不起性欲
They want class They don't want to fuck a Penny

259
00:20:41,843 --> 00:20:45,506
客人要操的是希迪、蝶芬妮…
They want to fuck a Heather or a Tiffany

260
00:20:45,813 --> 00:20:47,178
或喜望
Or a Hope

261
00:20:48,616 --> 00:20:49,913
這裡講究氣派
This is a class joint

262
00:20:50,318 --> 00:20:51,478
亨莉！
Henry!

263
00:20:51,953 --> 00:20:54,183
各位男嘉賓、及少數的女嘉賓…
Gentlemen, and you few ladies out there

264
00:20:54,255 --> 00:20:57,588
你們期望的波後：亨莉！
what you've been waiting for Henrietta, the Queen of Bazooms!

265
00:21:14,075 --> 00:21:17,101
亨莉！拉高你的裙子！
Hey, Henrietta! Pull your dress up!

266
00:21:17,545 --> 00:21:21,379
你哪是我的對手？這樣多肥膏…
Honey, you couldn't handle me With all this fat...

267
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:25,619
那活寶在哪裡，你決找不到
you'd never even find the thing

268
00:21:27,622 --> 00:21:30,750
我向你撒尿，你或找得到
l'd have to piss on you to give you a clue

269
00:21:33,494 --> 00:21:34,586
不夠粉紅色
You need more pink

270
00:21:35,563 --> 00:21:36,587
謝謝你，希迪
Thanks, Heather

271
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:41,196
跳過“坐懷舞”沒有？
Have you ever done a lap dance before?

272
00:21:43,571 --> 00:21:45,129
說服客人讓你跳
You talk them into it

273
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,608
每趟五十元，在後房跳
Fifty bucks a pop, you do it in the back

274
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:50,309
客人眼看手勿動
Touch and go. They touch, they go

275
00:21:50,745 --> 00:21:52,940
你可摸客人，客人不可摸你
You can touch them They cannot touch you

276
00:21:54,215 --> 00:21:55,341
真好
That's good

277
00:21:55,683 --> 00:21:57,674
胯內射精，可以
lf they come, that's okay

278
00:21:57,985 --> 00:22:00,545
客人拔出來射，你叫巡場來
lf they take it out and come all over you, call the bouncer

279
00:22:00,621 --> 00:22:03,920
若客人肯打賞，無關係
But if he gives you a big tip, then it's okay

280
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,489
明白嗎？

lf you want to last longer than a week, you give me a blow job

287
00:22:34,722 --> 00:22:38,715

Everybody got AlDS and shit What is it you think you do?

371
00:33:55,669 --> 00:33:59,833
你在意識上幹他們，不妥

My right hand's so tired, l can't thread a needle

381
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,864

00:34:34,341 --> 00:34:35,740
用左手執針線？
For threading a needle?

Oh, show me a home, where the buffalo roam

421
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,422
你參觀我的家園…
And l'll show you a home

422
00:37:42,529 --> 00:37:44,429
到處是糞便！

423
00:37:45,632 --> 00:37:46,963
多謝

424
00:37:50,737 --> 00:37:53,205
慕莉！

425
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,067

What is it?

426
00:37:56,143 --> 00:37:59,340
我獲邀試舞！

427
00:38:10,123 --> 00:38:11,385
寶麗安妮！
Hey, Pollyanna!

428
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:14,454
你叫我什麼？  你像寶麗安妮
What did you call me? You look like Pollyanna

429
00:38:15,195 --> 00:38:16,526
小姐們！
Okay, ladies!

00:38:17,664 --> 00:38:21,156
我叫東尼摩士，節目監製
l'm Tony Moss. l produce this show

431
00:38:21,868 --> 00:38:24,166
你們也許聽過，我是個衰人
Some of you may have heard l'm a prick

432
00:38:24,871 --> 00:38:26,395
如假包換的衰人
l am a prick

433
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,575
我只管節目的演出…
l have one interest, and that's the show

434
00:38:30,177 --> 00:38:32,042
不管你們的死活

435
00:38:32,345 --> 00:38:35,143
我要你們能跳、能笑
l want to see you dance and l want to see you smile

436
00:38:35,382 --> 00:38:39,079
你如果笑容、水準、責相不夠…
l can't use you if you can't smile, if you can't show, if you can't sell

437
00:38:39,152 --> 00:38:42,246
對我沒用，現在開始檢閱

441
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:52,227
算什麼？西瓜？
What are these, watermelons?

442
00:38:52,332 --> 00:38:55,631
這是舞臺，不是果園，再見
This a stage, not a patch. See ya

443
00:38:57,637 --> 00:38:58,797
我見過你

447
00:39:08,315 --> 00:39:11,216
可惜的是，耳朵兜風
You know what, though? Your ears stick out

448
00:39:11,651 --> 00:39:13,744
修理耳朵後再來
Come back after they're fixed

MGM  佩服
M-G-M l'm impressed

452
00:39:21,361 --> 00:39:24,159
把娃娃臉幹掉，再來
Come back when you've fucked this baby fat off

453
00:39:24,898 --> 00:39:27,890
你的頭像網球，須戴假髮
l hope you got some wigs, tennis ball

454
00:39:28,368 --> 00:39:29,858
上過什麼課程？

458
00:39:38,979 --> 00:39:39,809

00:39:45,986 --> 00:39:47,647
見識你這衰人
Watching you be a prick

463
00:39:49,689 --> 00:39:51,782
你還未開眼界呢
You ain't seen nothing yet

464
00:39:52,526 --> 00:39:54,756
琪！示範舞步

大家休息

網球頭、後面的黑髮
Tennis ball, dark hair in the back

473
00:40:29,462 --> 00:40:30,724

490
00:41:49,109 --> 00:41:50,235
停音樂！

491
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:53,836
試試練瑜伽，倒懸，再見

492
00:41:53,914 --> 00:41:54,846
馬狄，冰
Marty, ice

493
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:58,415
你的乳頭有不妥嗎？
Something wrong with your nipples?

494
00:41:59,586 --> 00:42:01,986
幹嗎不堅挺？弄堅挺乳頭

498
00:42:27,647 --> 00:42:29,512
你幹嗎還未堅挺？
Why aren't you erect?

499
00:42:33,386 --> 00:42:36,287
接著，敷冰

500
00:42:44,731 --> 00:42:45,832

再見，寶麗安妮！

503
00:43:02,248 --> 00:43:04,614
你叫我來試舞，對嗎？

504
00:43:07,387 --> 00:43:08,479

What difference does it make?

508
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,432
剛才你開心了吧？
Did you enjoy that out there?

509
00:43:24,237 --> 00:43:26,705
算得開心
Yeah, darling, l think l did

510
00:43:28,008 --> 00:43:29,600
我恨你
l hate you

511
00:43:30,944 --> 00:43:33,003
我知道
l know

512
00:43:40,754 --> 00:43:46,090
抹鼻
Wipe your nose

513
00:43:55,969 --> 00:43:57,800
牙醫會議的人在那邊！
The orthodontist convention is over there!

514
00:43:57,871 --> 00:44:00,101
地產會議二十分後開！
Realtors come in 20 minutes!

515
00:44:12,085 --> 00:44:13,211
你來幹什麼？
What are you doing here?

516
00:44:13,787 --> 00:44:15,311
剛參加試舞
l just had an audition

517
00:44:15,789 --> 00:44:17,347
想當舞蹈藝員？
You want to be a showgirl?

518
00:44:17,724 --> 00:44:19,817
占士，快去搬行李箱！
Smith, what is this?! Move those bags!

519
00:44:21,795 --> 00:44:23,456
試舞不順利？
Didn't go too good, huh?

520
00:44:25,865 --> 00:44:27,025
我很高興
l'm glad

521
00:44:27,133 --> 00:44:28,600
別發偉論，我沒心情聽！

522
00:44:28,701 --> 00:44:31,693
占士，我在叫你！
Smith, l'm talking to you!

523
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,505
舞蹈團不適合你
You don't want to be in this kind of show

524
00:44:36,409 --> 00:44:38,843
脫衣舞起碼擔白
At least what you do is honest

525
00:44:38,912 --> 00:44:41,312
觀眾要看胸臀，你就露胸露臀
They want tits and ass, that's what you give

526
00:44:41,648 --> 00:44:46,278
舞蹈團假充藝術，仍靠露胸露臀
Here, they pretend they want something else, you still show tits and ass

527
00:44:46,386 --> 00:44:50,152
要勾搭她，用你私人時間
You want to work her, work her on your own time

528
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:51,718
我在跟她談話
l'm talking to her

529
00:44:53,827 --> 00:44:57,228
我在跟她談話，並非勾搭她
l said l'm talking to her l'm not working her

530
00:44:57,330 --> 00:45:01,733
你打擾我，很無禮，給我滾！
You're interrupting me and that's rude Get the fuck out of here!

531
00:45:02,936 --> 00:45:04,130
賤種
Asshole

532
00:45:04,704 --> 00:45:05,762
革你職！
You're fired!

533
00:45:06,172 --> 00:45:07,867
拿著！
Take this!

534
00:45:09,742 --> 00:45:11,972
你幹的好事，又累我丟工作
Now look what you did. You got me fired again

535
00:45:13,179 --> 00:45:15,613
你的確無可藥救，不知羞
You're a real bad-ass. You got no shame

536
00:45:17,083 --> 00:45:21,713
天朗氣清、陽光燦爛、財源滾滾
Look what a beautiful day it is. The sun is shining, money's flowing

537
00:45:22,355 --> 00:45:25,847
我要替你解悶，請你吃超級大餐
l'm going to cheer you up. l'll get you the best meal in town

538
00:45:31,264 --> 00:45:32,526
津津有味
You like that burger!

539
00:45:34,567 --> 00:45:35,795
你從哪處來？
Where are you from?

540
00:45:36,603 --> 00:45:37,865
從各處來
Different Places

541
00:45:39,873 --> 00:45:42,774
你倒也樂意公開自己的事
You like talking about you, huh?

542
00:45:54,821 --> 00:45:56,186
什麼地方？  我的家
Where are we? My place

543
00:45:57,490 --> 00:45:58,718
來幹什麼？
Why?

544
00:45:58,791 --> 00:46:00,122
我想給你看點東西
l want to show you something

545
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:11,101
頂級套房，我千辛萬苦才租到
Best suite in town l had to beg and plead to get it

546
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:18,809
想給我看什麼？
This what you wanted me to see?

547
00:46:19,612 --> 00:46:22,547
什麼事？這張大床？
What? This nice, big bed here?

548
00:46:25,885 --> 00:46:29,184
這首曲我為你而作
l wrote this number. lt's about you

549
00:46:29,722 --> 00:46:31,417
你對我一無所知
You know nothing about me

550
00:46:31,724 --> 00:46:33,521
我知你肯私人表演
l know you're a private dancer

551
00:46:35,862 --> 00:46:37,989
湊足三個舞娘就行
l only need three other girls

552
00:46:38,631 --> 00:46:40,963
我們可到殷殷會所登臺
We can put it on at the Crave Club

553
00:46:42,135 --> 00:46:43,568
讓我示範
l'll show you

554
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:46,631
站在這裡看
Stand right here. Watch me

555
00:46:51,444 --> 00:46:54,174
慢點！這樣嗎？
Wait a minute, slow down! Like this?

556
00:47:09,062 --> 00:47:11,895
跟我跳，你跟得上
Follow me. l know you can

557
00:48:32,345 --> 00:48:33,835
我有月經
l have my period

558
00:48:34,714 --> 00:48:36,477
還用說

夠了，謝謝各位
Okay! That's enough. Thank you, ladies

699
00:57:56,308 --> 00:57:57,605
幹得好
Good job

700
00:57:58,277 --> 00:58:00,677
要她多練轉身，留意身體平衡
Work on her turns. l'm worried about her balance

701
00:58:01,413 --> 00:58:03,278
我幾時開始表演？
How long before l can do the show?

702
00:58:03,349 --> 00:58:04,338
今晚開始
You start tonight

703
00:58:06,418 --> 00:58:08,249
今晚？  你應付得來
Tonight? You'll be fine

704
00:58:11,757 --> 00:58:12,951
她的表現如何？
How did she do?

705
00:58:13,025 --> 00:58:14,049
並非花拳繡腿
She's no butterfly

706
00:58:15,494 --> 00:58:19,931
腰有挺勁，渾身野性
She's all pelvic thrust. She prowls. She's got it

707
00:58:19,999 --> 00:58:21,364
哪處來的野性？
l wonder how she got it?

708
00:58:21,734 --> 00:58:23,099
不是學來的
She didn't learn it

709
00:58:23,168 --> 00:58:25,534
是學來的，但並非從課堂學來
She learned it, but it's not taught in any class

710
00:58:28,374 --> 00:58:30,535
多點橙色，我替你塗
You need more orange. Let me do it

711
00:58:33,279 --> 00:58:34,439
覺得怎樣？
How do you feel?

712
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:36,647
不要問！
Don't ask. Don't ask!

713
00:58:37,483 --> 00:58:38,643
我的化妝品呢？
Who took my make-up?

714
00:58:38,717 --> 00:58:41,049
猩猩來了！
Monkey alert! Monkey alert!

715
00:58:44,757 --> 00:58:46,691
早叫你看管猩猩！
Damn it, Hector! l told you!

716
00:58:46,959 --> 00:58:48,927
猩猩春情動，要生孩子！
They get the heat! They make babies!

717
00:58:48,994 --> 00:58:50,018
孩子？
Babies?

718
00:58:51,697 --> 00:58:52,595
趕出去
Oh, get it out

719
00:58:52,932 --> 00:58:53,899
小心
Watch it

720
00:58:56,769 --> 00:58:58,737
走！   抓著那猩猩！
Go! Go! Grab her!

721
00:58:59,204 --> 00:59:00,865
我抓著一頭！
Hey! l got one!

722
00:59:02,441 --> 00:59:03,567
其餘在樓上
The rest are upstairs

723
00:59:03,642 --> 00:59:06,577
淫婦，不准再碰我的化妝品！
Julie, you slut, don't touch my make-up!

724
00:59:06,645 --> 00:59:09,239
淫婦？你操那送外賣的小子！
l'm a slut? You fucked that pizza place kid!

725
00:59:09,315 --> 00:59:10,441
你操那抄表漢子！
You fucked the meter reader!

726
00:59:10,749 --> 00:59:13,115
潑貨！   你活得不耐煩
Bitch! You're fucking dead!

727
00:59:15,421 --> 00:59:17,446
安妮，停手
Jesus, Annie, get off her!

728
00:59:17,856 --> 00:59:19,790
茱莉，冷靜點
Julie! Calm down! Stop it!

729
00:59:20,326 --> 00:59:22,726
打架到此為止
Now settle down! lt's done!

730
00:59:25,564 --> 00:59:26,861
夠鐘演出

731
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:29,999
去！四個八拍！
Move! You got four counts of eight!

732
00:59:30,069 --> 00:59:31,400
等一等，假髮
Nomi, wait. Your wig

733
00:59:32,972 --> 00:59:34,837
你應付得來，大家上去！
You're fine. Let's move up, you guys!

734
00:59:34,907 --> 00:59:36,067
舞臺上有糞便
There's shit on the stage

735
00:59:36,976 --> 00:59:39,342
猩猩吃完蒜頭總拉糞
They always shit. lt's that garlic

736
00:59:39,411 --> 00:59:40,969
糞便在哪？  左後邊

737
00:59:41,046 --> 00:59:43,742
左後舞臺有猩猩糞，去！

第二拍，一、二…去！

746
01:00:29,695 --> 01:00:30,957

戴上去，行
Put this on. You're done

754
01:02:43,517 --> 01:02:46,486
我沒摔倒  差點摔倒

755
01:02:46,553 --> 01:02:47,611
喂！
Hey, yo!

756
01:02:48,455 --> 01:02:49,683
談談行嗎？
Can l talk to you a minute?

757
01:02:50,924 --> 01:02:52,084
求求你
Come on, please?

758
01:02:53,393 --> 01:02:54,257
談吧
Talk

759
01:02:54,795 --> 01:02:55,819
單獨談
Alone?

760
01:02:57,130 --> 01:02:59,030
我去開車  我很快來
l'll get the car. Be right there

761
01:03:03,837 --> 01:03:04,997
誰送的花？
Who sent you the flowers?

762
01:03:07,374 --> 01:03:08,602
不關你事
None of your business

763
01:03:09,676 --> 01:03:12,474
我只想說…
Okay. l just wanted to say...

764
01:03:12,579 --> 01:03:14,274
你我間沒有瓜葛
You and me ain't got no ties

765
01:03:19,853 --> 01:03:21,787
我承認好色
l have a problem with pussy

766
01:03:22,289 --> 01:03:24,985
一向如此，改不了
l always have, and l always will

767
01:03:25,325 --> 01:03:26,451
但我言出由衷
But l meant what l said

768
01:03:26,527 --> 01:03:30,520
我才不管 那首曲確為你而作
l don't care about your problems. l did write it for you

769
01:03:32,299 --> 01:03:35,666
但我答應過教她，也搞上她
But l did tell her l would teach her, and l did fuck her

770
01:03:36,336 --> 01:03:39,362
你搞上誰是你的事，不關我事
Who you fuck is your business l won't make it mine

771
01:03:41,275 --> 01:03:44,642
那首曲既然賺不了錢…
lt's not like l'm seeing any money for writing that number

772
01:03:45,779 --> 01:03:48,270
我順便用來泡女人
l may as well touch a little pussy

773
01:03:50,918 --> 01:03:52,886
你沒話說？
You got nothing to say

774
01:03:53,654 --> 01:03:55,019

No

775

777
01:04:01,028 --> 01:04:02,825
我從沒接過花
l never got flowers before

778
01:04:04,031 --> 01:04:06,829
我肯定陸續有來
l'm sure you'll get lots of them

779
01:04:09,036 --> 01:04:10,298
他送的花？
He gave them to you?

780
01:04:11,371 --> 01:04:12,565
對
Yeah, he did

781
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:15,433
幹什麼職業？扯皮條？
What is he? A pimp?

782
01:04:15,909 --> 01:04:18,343
那是部扯皮條型的汽車
Only people with pimp cars are pimps

783
01:04:18,879 --> 01:04:21,177
他是娛樂總監
He's the entertainment director

784
01:04:21,248 --> 01:04:23,113
果然是扯皮條
That's what l said. He's a pimp!

785
01:04:23,483 --> 01:04:24,643
我們走吧
Let's go!

祝你好運
Good luck with your number

796
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:31,683
廢話少說

797
01:05:32,085 --> 01:05:33,143
好吧
Okay

798
01:05:34,254 --> 01:05:37,155
你我一直有點誤會
We got off on the wrong foot

799
01:05:37,858 --> 01:05:39,917
不記前嫌，和解如何？
Want to start dancing all over again?

800
01:05:40,961 --> 01:05:42,895
為什麼和解？
Why?

801
01:05:42,963 --> 01:05:44,487
為什麼不和解？
Why not?

比狗糧難吃

816
01:06:40,754 --> 01:06:41,846

01:08:30,197 --> 01:08:32,665
我不喜歡在獵豹露
l didn't like showing them at the Cheetah

842
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:34,827
為什麼？
Why not?

843
01:08:35,202 --> 01:08:39,502
我跟所有觀眾一樣欣賞
l liked looking at them there. Everybody did

844
01:08:40,273 --> 01:08:41,934
我覺得像娼妓
lt made me feel like a hooker

845
01:08:42,309 --> 01:08:43,936
你是娼妓啊
You are a whore, darling

846
01:08:44,010 --> 01:08:45,409
我不是
l'm not!

847
01:08:45,478 --> 01:08:46,911
我們都是
We all are

848
01:08:47,314 --> 01:08:52,081
我們賺錢，全靠迎合觀眾的愛好
We take the cash, we cash the check, we show them what they want to see

849
01:08:52,152 --> 01:08:54,882
也許你是娼妓，我不是
Maybe you're a whore, but l'm not

850
01:08:58,058 --> 01:09:00,390
你與我…
You and me...

851
01:09:00,493 --> 01:09:03,985
都是同一種人
we're exactly alike

852
01:09:12,105 --> 01:09:14,471
我怎也不會似你
l'll never be like you

853
01:09:19,045 --> 01:09:23,243
姬小姐，麻煩你簽個名，行嗎？
Miss Connors! Sorry to bother you Would you sign this for me?

854
01:09:23,316 --> 01:09:25,477
樂意，大名是什麼？
Happy to. What's your name?

855
01:09:25,552 --> 01:09:27,884
法蘭，來自德州
Frank. l'm from Galveston

856
01:09:28,421 --> 01:09:30,981
我也是德州人
l'm from Del Rio myself, Frank

857
01:09:31,057 --> 01:09:34,151
我早說過她是德州人，瞧！
l told you she was from Texas. Whoo-ee, look at that!

858
01:09:35,028 --> 01:09:36,620
也替我簽，行嗎？
Could l have one like that?

859
01:09:36,997 --> 01:09:39,795
你不想印幹我的口紅吧？
You want a girl to use up all her lipstick on you?

860
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:43,068
想跳舞嗎？   現在跳？
Want to dance? Right now?

861
01:09:43,436 --> 01:09:46,064
正如貓王那首歌：“機不可失”
lt's now or never. That's what Elvis said

862
01:09:50,443 --> 01:09:53,310
我聽過句金石良言…
You know the best advice l ever got?

863
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:57,146
你渴望得到一個舞臺空缺…
You're up there onstage, hoping on a spot

864
01:09:57,517 --> 01:10:00,850
不妨把所有對手，逐個踩下臺
lf someone gets in your way, step on them

865
01:10:01,388 --> 01:10:05,381
最後剩下你，空缺非你莫屬
lf you're the only one left standing there, they hire you

866
01:10:06,092 --> 01:10:08,754
我想說的已說完，謝謝
That's about it. Thank you and good night

867
01:10:08,862 --> 01:10:11,763
到此為止
Elvis has left the building

868
01:11:17,998 --> 01:11:20,057
親愛的，看吧…
You see, darling...

869
01:11:20,166 --> 01:11:22,100
你是娼妓
you are a whore

870
01:11:25,071 --> 01:11:26,538
賤人！
Bitch!

871
01:11:31,578 --> 01:11:33,705
大概已鬧翻
Guess we're done

872
01:11:45,759 --> 01:11:47,522
妮奇，我有話跟你說
Nicky, can l talk to you for a second?

873
01:11:55,468 --> 01:11:57,936
媽，看猴子行嗎？  現在不行
Mommy, can we see the monkeys? Not now

874
01:11:58,304 --> 01:12:01,408
求求你  猴子要工作
Please. They're so cute. They have to work

875
01:12:01,408 --> 01:12:02,841
什麼工作？
What are they doing?

876
01:12:02,909 --> 01:12:05,036
我要看猴子！   現在不行
l want to see the monkeys! Not now

877
01:12:05,111 --> 01:12:06,510
為什麼？
Why not?

878
01:12:06,579 --> 01:12:08,570
趕他媽的小孩出去
Get these fucking kids out of here

879
01:12:09,516 --> 01:12:12,314
你說粗口！她說粗口
You said the F'' word! She said the ''F'' word''

880
01:12:12,685 --> 01:12:13,879
她說粗口
She said the F'' word!''

881
01:12:13,953 --> 01:12:15,580
他媽的閉嘴！
Shut the fuck up!

882
01:12:23,363 --> 01:12:24,990
不要怕
lt's okay. lt's okay

883
01:12:26,766 --> 01:12:30,702
下星期本城舉行遊艇展覽會
Nomi, a boat convention's coming into town next week

884
01:12:30,804 --> 01:12:32,939
要兩位小姐，妮奇願去
They need two girls. Nicky's doing it

885

886
01:12:37,877 --> 01:12:40,778
一千元？幹什麼？
A thousand dollars? To do what?

887
01:12:41,114 --> 01:12:45,642
替酒店宣傳，花枝招展地拍照
Represent the hotel. You wear your costume, smile, they take your picture

888
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:48,285
一千元？
A thousand dollars?

889

雜誌的特寫… 稍後才理會
Cristal, about the magazine layout...? Later

893
01:13:07,207 --> 01:13:08,435

她們都不高興
They didn't like it

899
01:13:26,659 --> 01:13:28,251
你幹過沒有？

Let's thank these 2 beautiful girls from Goddess'', a new smash at the Stardust''

903
01:14:11,404 --> 01:14:12,735

Shit

904

情況怎樣？   好
How's it going? Fine

905

對極
Very

他是我們賭場的大豪客
He's one of our very, very high rollers

909
01:14:25,084 --> 01:14:28,520
表演完後，肯賞面一同進餐嗎？

910
01:14:28,588 --> 01:14:31,557
吃龍蝦，聽凱撒唱歌
Have some lobster, hear Caesar sing

911
01:14:31,624 --> 01:14:35,560
聽過凱撒唱歌嗎？保證悅耳

912
01:14:36,296 --> 01:14:37,422

Oh, forget it

927
01:15:26,613 --> 01:15:27,807

可惜
l'm sorry to hear that

01:15:58,144 --> 01:15:59,577
離譜
Jesus

935
01:16:02,982 --> 01:16:06,713
對不起，有些人真不知所謂
l'm sorry. Some people just don't get it

936
01:16:08,621 --> 01:16:11,784
我在臺上，叫菲臘來

937
01:16:13,092 --> 01:16:14,059

吃角子機進賬增33%
The drop is up 33% on those machines

940
01:16:21,567 --> 01:16:24,866

lt will make your bottom line about 250

941
01:16:28,608 --> 01:16:30,508
我?這工作獲MBA
l got an MBA for this

942
01:16:31,110 --> 01:16:35,706
現在注重的是，成本分析
That's what this business is now cost analyzing slot machines

943
01:16:36,215 --> 01:16:38,183
MBA是什麼？

944
01:16:39,819 --> 01:16:41,616
沙克，你在嗎？
Zack, you in here?

945
01:16:42,789 --> 01:16:43,813
失陪
Excuse me

946
01:16:44,957 --> 01:16:47,551
唏！什麼事？
Hey! What's going on?

947
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:49,685
再有下趟，你另謀高就
You do anything like this again, you're fired

948
01:16:50,196 --> 01:16:52,391
什麼也沒發生  還強辯？
Nothing happened. Something did!

949
01:16:52,832 --> 01:16:54,459
她未搞清楚就亂跳
She jumped to conclusions

950
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:59,299
下趟，輪到你跳：請你跳槽
lt happens again, you'll jump to your conclusion

951
01:16:59,639 --> 01:17:01,539
休想有遣散費
Without your golden parachute

952
01:17:03,176 --> 01:17:04,871
還不向她道歉？
You owe her an apology

953
01:17:08,548 --> 01:17:11,108
娜美，對不起
Nomi, l'm sorry. l apologize

滾
Get out

956
01:17:20,927 --> 01:17:25,660
MBA是工管碩士，沒實際用場
An MBA is a college degree. lt's mostly worthless in the real world

957
01:17:29,035 --> 01:17:30,627
你雄心勃勃
You go for it, don't you?

958
01:17:31,771 --> 01:17:33,966
我盡力而為

Thank you for looking out for me. You were so nice to recommend me to Phil

What are friends for?

965
01:18:13,546 --> 01:18:14,672
對
Right

展覽會的事，你說得對
You were right about the convention

967
01:18:25,024 --> 01:18:26,184
甜姐兒
Sweet baby!

968
01:18:27,427 --> 01:18:29,895
你再摸，我扭斷你的手指！
Do that again, l'll break your fingers!

969
01:18:29,962 --> 01:18:32,590
沒法，只有我對異性有興趣
Not my fault you don't have a gay partner

970
01:18:32,698 --> 01:18:33,722
操你
Fuck you

971
01:18:33,833 --> 01:18:36,802
他拼命宣傳自己是異性戀
He wants everyone to see how hetero he is

972
01:18:36,903 --> 01:18:39,633
拿電筒照照他的行頭多大
Molly, bring that flashlight so l can see how big it is

973
01:18:40,006 --> 01:18:42,031
想吃老拳嗎？
You want a knuckle sandwich?

974
01:18:42,375 --> 01:18:44,639
我用後門吃，行嗎？
Can l have mine anally, please?

975
01:18:44,710 --> 01:18:46,644
別吵了！離譜
Come on, you guys! Jesus!

976
01:18:46,712 --> 01:18:48,441
列隊準備！
Let's go! Let's line it up!

977
01:18:49,182 --> 01:18:50,513
望什麼？賤人
What you looking at, bitch?

978
01:18:50,850 --> 01:18:53,648
快點！去！
Okay, let's go. Move it! Go, go, go!

979
01:19:32,391 --> 01:19:33,688
糟糕
Oh, my God

980
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:03,083
傷了哪處？安妮
Are you okay, Annie?

981
01:20:22,742 --> 01:20:24,209
我的腿
lt's my leg

982
01:20:24,277 --> 01:20:25,642
哪處痛？
Tell me when it hurts

983
01:20:27,647 --> 01:20:28,636
她的膝蓋
lt's her knee

984
01:20:29,081 --> 01:20:30,241
碎了，對嗎？
lt isn't broken, is it?

985
01:20:30,816 --> 01:20:32,283
什麼回事？
Daryl, what happened?

986
01:20:32,685 --> 01:20:34,243
我一時腳滑
My foot went out from under me

987
01:20:36,489 --> 01:20:38,354
是這一回事
This is what happened

988
01:20:41,694 --> 01:20:43,423
怎會在舞臺上出現？
l wonder how those got up here?

989
01:20:44,063 --> 01:20:45,894
或許從服飾脫落
Probably came off a costume

990
01:20:46,265 --> 01:20:48,130
我們送你入院
We'll get you to the hospital

991
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:49,497
好痛
Shit, no!

992
01:20:49,569 --> 01:20:53,005
可憐的安妮，多倒楣
Jesus. Poor Annie. Tough break

993
01:20:53,372 --> 01:20:54,396
請挪開
Let us through here

994
01:20:58,978 --> 01:21:00,138
稍後見
See you later

995
01:21:01,847 --> 01:21:02,836
我是監製
l'm the producer

996
01:21:02,915 --> 01:21:05,543
你是我雇員，聽我命令
l hired you! You do what l say

997
01:21:05,618 --> 01:21:08,280
安妮是我的候補，我有發言權
She was my understudy. l have a say, too

998
01:21:08,354 --> 01:21:10,890
但決策權不在你處
Yeah, but guess who makes the decision

999
01:21:10,890 --> 01:21:12,255
她的膝蓋碎了
lt's broken, kids

1000
01:21:12,858 --> 01:21:15,695
慘，要三個月才復原
Shit. That will be three months

1001
01:21:15,695 --> 01:21:16,491
起碼
At least

1002
01:21:19,265 --> 01:21:20,630
報應
Bad karma, huh?

1003
01:21:20,933 --> 01:21:22,730
娜美，你媽媽在等你
Nomi, your mother's waiting for you

1004
01:21:23,703 --> 01:21:25,000
我的媽媽？
My mother?

1005
01:21:25,538 --> 01:21:28,735
為你著想，我希望她不是
For your sake, l hope she's not

1006
01:21:30,710 --> 01:21:32,974
醒睡的人易睡醒…
lf a light sleeper sleeps with a light on

1007
01:21:33,045 --> 01:21:35,070
挺硬的人可硬挺？
Can a hard sleeper sleep with a hard on?

1008
01:21:35,381 --> 01:21:39,511
雌老虎哪處厲害？兩個吃人的口
What do you call a tiger? A big pussy that eats people

1009
01:21:39,585 --> 01:21:40,677
亨莉！
Henry!

1010
01:21:43,823 --> 01:21:46,621
吻出口水，好過噴出口水
l can get shit on, but l don't like getting spit on

1011
01:21:49,462 --> 01:21:50,622
阿爾
Hi, Al

1012
01:21:51,497 --> 01:21:52,691
你難看極
You look like shit

1013
01:21:53,366 --> 01:21:56,233
十吋陽具也不及她好看
She looks better than a 10-inch dick and you know it

1014
01:21:57,903 --> 01:22:00,804
在這裡…工作開心嗎？
So...do you like it here?

1015
01:22:00,873 --> 01:22:02,238
難道她會懷念你？
What, you think she misses you?

1016
01:22:02,908 --> 01:22:04,341
有什麼稀奇？
Yeah, why not?

1017
01:22:04,877 --> 01:22:06,276
我們懷念她
We miss her

1018
01:22:06,379 --> 01:22:10,645
她懷念我們，像我懷念我那痔瘡
She misses us like that lump on my twat l had taken off last week

1019
01:22:10,716 --> 01:22:11,944
離譜
Jesus, Henry

1020
01:22:20,126 --> 01:22:21,525
我們看過你演出
We saw the show

1021
01:22:23,195 --> 01:22:24,628
你跳得精彩
You were good

1022
01:22:26,866 --> 01:22:28,197
謝謝你，阿爾
Thank you, Al

1023
01:22:33,005 --> 01:22:34,939
的確精彩
Real good

1024
01:22:38,377 --> 01:22:40,743
保重，小姑娘
You take care, kid

1025
01:22:45,951 --> 01:22:50,012
你沒有引死人，著實奇怪
Must be weird, not having anyone come on you

1026
01:22:55,161 --> 01:22:58,028
娜美，要我載嗎？
Nomi. Hey, you want a ride?

1027
01:23:00,599 --> 01:23:01,588
我已有人載
l got one

1028
01:23:06,205 --> 01:23:07,433
等一等！
Wait!

1029
01:23:11,577 --> 01:23:13,067
坐過這汽車嗎？
Ever been in one of these?

1030
01:23:13,145 --> 01:23:13,975
不
No

1031
01:23:14,914 --> 01:23:16,313
我夢寐以求的事
l always wanted one

1032
01:23:18,584 --> 01:23:21,018
不同凡響吧？   不算差勁
lt's some car, huh? lt doesn't suck

1033
01:23:22,822 --> 01:23:25,188
往哪處去？你帶路
Where are we headed? Give me directions

1034
01:23:27,293 --> 01:23:28,658
往你家去
To your place

1035
01:23:48,314 --> 01:23:49,645
你愛喝姬絲桃香檳？
Do you like Cristal?

1036
01:23:50,416 --> 01:23:52,509
我愛喝各種香檳
l like a lot of different champagnes

1037
01:23:53,886 --> 01:23:56,116
但我只喝香檳
But l always drink champagne

1038
01:23:57,823 --> 01:23:59,552
安德魯是怎樣的人？
What's Andrew Carver like?

1039
01:24:00,259 --> 01:24:03,160
你緊張？毋須緊張
Are you nervous? Don't be

1040
01:24:04,130 --> 01:24:05,495
我沒有緊張
l'm not

1041
01:24:10,703 --> 01:24:13,001
我喜歡你的高潮
l liked it when you came

1042
01:24:16,142 --> 01:24:18,269
喜歡你的眼睛
l liked your eyes

1043
01:27:29,001 --> 01:27:30,593
留下來
Stay with me

1044
01:27:31,337 --> 01:27:33,066
早上我載你回去
l'll drive you back in the morning

1045
01:27:33,405 --> 01:27:34,872
現在是早上
lt is morning

1046
01:27:35,574 --> 01:27:36,836
請留下來
Please?

1047
01:27:36,909 --> 01:27:38,240
我已叫計程車
l have a taxi coming

1048
01:27:38,978 --> 01:27:40,445
取消好了
Send it back

1049
01:27:46,151 --> 01:27:48,312
姬絲桃要位新候補
Cristal needs a new understudy

1050
01:27:49,855 --> 01:27:53,154
中午試舞，可有興趣？
There's an audition at noon. You want to try?

1051
01:27:55,094 --> 01:27:57,961
我不來這裡，你會告訴我嗎？
Would you have told me if l hadn't come here?

1052
01:27:58,330 --> 01:28:01,322
提議來的是你，不是我
lt was your idea to come here, not mine

1053
01:28:05,804 --> 01:28:08,102
我想再見你
l want to see you again

1054
01:28:09,341 --> 01:28:10,899
看情形才說
We'll see how it goes

1055
01:28:14,947 --> 01:28:17,177
看什麼情形？試舞？
What, the audition?

1056
01:28:26,959 --> 01:28:28,483
十元半
Ten-fifty

1057
01:28:37,636 --> 01:28:38,967
喂！
Hello!

1058
01:28:41,740 --> 01:28:42,866
恨死你
l hate you

1059
01:28:43,909 --> 01:28:46,173
對方是誰？   沙克
Who was he? Zack

1060
01:28:46,512 --> 01:28:48,377
還得了
Oh, my God

1061
01:28:48,981 --> 01:28:50,346
有沒有縛起他？
Did you tie him up?

1062
01:28:50,783 --> 01:28:51,807
慘
Oh, shit

1063
01:28:52,785 --> 01:28:54,446
我忘記解開他
l forgot to untie him

1064
01:28:59,124 --> 01:29:00,386
吸毒吸醉了？
Are you high?

1065
01:29:00,826 --> 01:29:02,555
有點
Maybe a little

1066
01:29:04,463 --> 01:29:08,866
不能睡，中午要試舞，麥片呢？
l can't go to sleep. l have an audition at noon. Where are the Sugar Snaps?

1067
01:29:09,234 --> 01:29:11,498
在櫃裡，娜美…
ln the cupboard. Nomi...

1068
01:29:11,904 --> 01:29:13,929
不要上毒癮
don't get sucked into it

1069
01:29:16,675 --> 01:29:18,233
看我找到什麼！
Look what l found!

1070
01:29:21,046 --> 01:29:22,741
隨便你好了
Okay, whatever, Nomes

1071
01:29:53,078 --> 01:29:54,272
我選茱莉
Julie

1072
01:29:54,847 --> 01:29:57,680
她不夠性感  她舞步熟練
She's not hot enough. She has it down

1073
01:29:57,883 --> 01:30:01,512
但沒有姬絲桃的熱力
You can teach it. She doesn't have Cristal's heat

1074
01:30:01,854 --> 01:30:03,913
誰也沒有
None of them have Cristal's heat

1075
01:30:04,656 --> 01:30:06,385
教我怎不愛你
l do love you, Gay

1076
01:30:06,859 --> 01:30:08,258
娜美有熱力
Nomi has heat

1077
01:30:09,862 --> 01:30:10,954
有嗎？
Does she?

1078
01:30:12,030 --> 01:30:13,327
娜美有
Yes, she does

1079
01:30:14,833 --> 01:30:16,892
完全不同的熱力
ln a totally different way

1080
01:30:17,336 --> 01:30:20,100
說笑！由她當主角？
Come on! She's going to take the lead?

1081
01:30:20,472 --> 01:30:23,236
這是大型節目，不是脫衣舞！
This a hotel show! lt's not the Cheetah!

1082
01:30:23,575 --> 01:30:26,942
不要緊，八年來我從未失場
lt doesn't matter l haven't missed a show in 8 years

1083
01:30:27,312 --> 01:30:29,303
你不會愈來愈年輕
You're not getting any younger

1084
01:30:29,481 --> 01:30:30,709
狗種
Eat me

1085
01:30:31,450 --> 01:30:33,418
看娜美試舞嗎？  不
Want to see it again with just Nomi? No

1086
01:30:33,919 --> 01:30:35,853
我看，去準備吧
l do. Set it up, Marty

1087
01:30:35,921 --> 01:30:37,218
不知所謂
This is bullshit

1088
01:30:37,956 --> 01:30:39,446
假公濟私
lt's about your dick

1089
01:30:39,825 --> 01:30:41,053
妮奇、茱莉，謝謝
Nicky, Julie, thank you!

1090
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:43,288
有她的資料嗎？
What do we know about her?

1091
01:30:43,395 --> 01:30:46,296
全無，連福利證號碼也不可靠
Nothing. l doubt her Social Security number's right

1092
01:30:46,365 --> 01:30:47,832
調查她   查什麼？
Find out. What?

1093
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:48,992
一切
Everything

1094
01:31:03,582 --> 01:31:05,311
你與她有一手？
You fucked her, didn't you?

1095
01:31:05,884 --> 01:31:10,287
你生氣，因為妒忌？抑或…
Are you pissed off because you're jealous?

1096
01:31:10,355 --> 01:31:12,414
因為被我捷足先登？
Or because l beat you to the punch?

1097
01:31:33,679 --> 01:31:37,479
你操他，為空缺？抑或為興趣？
You fuck him for the spot or because you wanted to?

1098
01:31:40,485 --> 01:31:42,851
我相信，你為空缺
l say you did it for the spot

1099
01:31:43,422 --> 01:31:46,084
你慣用身體作交易？
ls that what you did, Cristal?

1100
01:31:46,692 --> 01:31:50,150
我們既是朋友，激怒我對你無益
You don't want to piss me off, now that we're friends

1101
01:31:50,696 --> 01:31:53,665
你不應動怒
No, you shouldn't get pissed off

1102
01:31:53,966 --> 01:31:55,433
動怒令你衰老
lt makes you look older

1103
01:32:01,173 --> 01:32:05,007
你升為候補
You got it

1104
01:32:05,844 --> 01:32:07,209
真的？
l do?

1105
01:32:08,347 --> 01:32:10,008
馬狄與琪會教你
Marty and Gay will work with you

1106
01:32:10,415 --> 01:32:13,748
菲臘會安排宣傳，你幹得好
Phil will have some glossies taken. You did good

1107
01:32:14,853 --> 01:32:17,253
我們一起進餐、吃龍蝦
l'll call you for dinner, lobster

1108
01:32:17,623 --> 01:32:20,319
聽過凱撒唱歌嗎？保證悅耳
Did you ever hear Caesar sing? You'll love it

1109
01:32:31,303 --> 01:32:32,827
望什麼？
What?

1110
01:32:34,506 --> 01:32:38,067
恭喜，原來你多才多藝
Congratulations. l see you have many talents

1111
01:32:38,944 --> 01:32:40,775
我認為她跳得好
l thought she did good

1112
01:32:46,818 --> 01:32:50,652
殷殷會所 占士舞蹈演出

1113
01:33:02,467 --> 01:33:06,563
事後我才知道試舞的事
l didn't know about the audition until afterwards

1114
01:33:09,875 --> 01:33:12,036
我的指甲怎樣？
Do you like my nails?

1115
01:33:23,722 --> 01:33:25,917
比不上你的漂亮
They're not as nice as yours

1116
01:33:30,962 --> 01:33:33,487
也許有空我替你修甲
Maybe l'll help you with yours sometime

1117
01:33:38,303 --> 01:33:40,203
你願意的話
lf you want

1118
01:33:43,208 --> 01:33:46,109
你真好人
lsn't that nice of you, darling?

1119
01:33:46,478 --> 01:33:48,412
我們是朋友嘛
What are friends for?

1120
01:33:56,321 --> 01:33:58,221
想深一層…
On second thought...

1121
01:34:00,025 --> 01:34:02,823
也許不應讓你修甲
maybe you shouldn't do mine

1122
01:34:04,262 --> 01:34:08,198
我太老，不適合婊子打扮
l'm getting too old for that whory look

1123
01:34:09,368 --> 01:34:11,302
我會考慮一下
l'll think about it

1124
01:34:14,706 --> 01:34:17,004
出去時關門
Close the door on your way out

1125
01:35:12,197 --> 01:35:14,358
不懂跳舞，不要假充！
Hey, bring on the real dancers!

1126
01:35:16,802 --> 01:35:18,429
噓！
Boo!

1127
01:35:19,538 --> 01:35:21,267
差勁！
You suck!

1128
01:35:24,643 --> 01:35:26,201
下臺！
Get off the stage!

1129
01:35:27,179 --> 01:35:29,579
表演夠了！
Enough of this stuff!

1130
01:35:29,981 --> 01:35:31,710
我們跳舞吧！
Let's dance!

1131
01:35:42,928 --> 01:35:46,295
好看、出色
l loved it! lt was good

1132
01:35:46,364 --> 01:35:48,298
你來，不怕失身份？
What are you doing here, slumming?

1133
01:35:48,366 --> 01:35:49,731
希迪！
Heather!

1134
01:35:51,570 --> 01:35:52,537
我們怎樣？
Were we good?

1135
01:35:52,637 --> 01:35:53,535
好極
Great

1136
01:35:53,872 --> 01:35:55,169
她跳得笨手笨腳
She dances like a truck!

1137
01:35:55,941 --> 01:35:59,444
怎會！要喝東西嗎？
l do not! Do you want something to drink?

1138
01:35:59,444 --> 01:36:00,809
來杯啤酒，婆娘
Yeah. Get me a beer, bitch

1139
01:36:02,881 --> 01:36:04,348
看我的戒指
Look what l got

1140
01:36:07,018 --> 01:36:08,144
真美
lt's beautiful

1141
01:36:08,453 --> 01:36:09,943
我從祖母處偷來
l stole it from my grandmother

1142
01:36:10,422 --> 01:36:13,448
不是！你從當鋪處買
You did not! You got it at a pawnshop

1143
01:36:22,367 --> 01:36:23,800
我們快結婚
We're getting married

1144
01:36:26,972 --> 01:36:28,166
你愛她？
You love her?

1145
01:36:29,474 --> 01:36:32,136
不知道，奉子成婚
l don't know. She's having a baby

1146
01:36:36,982 --> 01:36:38,142
演出呢？
And this?

1147
01:36:39,284 --> 01:36:43,744
不受歡迎，觀眾喝倒采
We ain't any good. You heard them. ''Get off the stage!''

1148
01:36:45,724 --> 01:36:46,816
有什麼打算？
What will you do?

1149
01:36:48,727 --> 01:36:52,424
幫外母打理雜貨店
Work in a grocery store Her mother owns it

1150
01:36:53,398 --> 01:36:56,458
嬰兒食物我們有折扣
We'll get a discount on baby food

1151
01:37:07,812 --> 01:37:09,074
再見
See ya

1152
01:37:12,951 --> 01:37:17,911
認命吧、做人難，對我用得上
Shit happens, you know? Life sucks. l'm a student of T-shirts!

1153
01:37:29,167 --> 01:37:30,634
妮奇
Hey, Nicky

1154
01:37:39,878 --> 01:37:41,243
娜美小姐…
Dear Ms. Malone,

1155
01:37:41,346 --> 01:37:45,646
我們不能選你為後補…萬分遺憾
We regret we are unable to offer you...understudy

1156
01:37:58,296 --> 01:37:59,564
不准進去！
You can't go in there!

1157
01:37:59,564 --> 01:38:00,462
什麼事？
What's going on?

1158
01:38:00,865 --> 01:38:02,264
“什麼事？”
What's going on?!

1159
01:38:02,334 --> 01:38:04,666
冷靜點   “冷靜點”！
Hey, cool it. Cool it?!

1160
01:38:05,737 --> 01:38:07,364
竟發這封信來！
When you sent me this?!

1161
01:38:07,439 --> 01:38:10,272
她用離職威脅，出動律師
She threatened to walk! She got her lawyers into it!

1162
01:38:10,342 --> 01:38:11,400
又如何？
So what?!

1163
01:38:11,476 --> 01:38:13,774
她是個明星！你及不上
So, she's a star! You're not worth it

1164
01:38:15,380 --> 01:38:17,211
對不起，娜美，我已盡力
Sorry, Nomi. l tried. Fuck!

1165
01:38:19,918 --> 01:38:24,617
繩胯斷掉，我赤裸裸跳足五分鐘
Basically, my G-string snapped. There l was, dancing butt naked for 5 mins

1166
01:38:24,990 --> 01:38:26,582
難為了我的舞伴
l mean, my poor partner!

1167
01:38:29,327 --> 01:38:31,989
我考慮過，親愛的
l thought about it, darling

1168
01:38:33,832 --> 01:38:35,823
現在替我修甲，行嗎？
Think you could do my nails now?

1169
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:43,468
行
Okay

1170
01:38:43,808 --> 01:38:45,400
或許改天吧
Maybe some other time

1171
01:40:57,041 --> 01:41:00,477
隨我來…女奴隸
Come on...slave girl

1172
01:41:04,282 --> 01:41:06,045
五分鐘後出場，快！
We've got five minutes. Go!

1173
01:41:08,253 --> 01:41:13,281
大家趕快！
Go, you guys! Run, run!

1174
01:41:19,731 --> 01:41:21,130
讓路！
Let me through!

1175
01:41:22,700 --> 01:41:23,928
慘！
Shit!

1176
01:41:25,236 --> 01:41:26,703
姬絲桃，你聽見我嗎？
Cristal, can you hear me?

1177
01:41:27,639 --> 01:41:29,504
叫馬狄來！
Somebody get Marty!

1178
01:41:34,512 --> 01:41:35,740
什麼事？   不知道
What happened? l don't know

1179
01:41:36,681 --> 01:41:38,046
召救傷車！
Somebody get an ambulance!

1180
01:41:38,650 --> 01:41:39,912
誰在她後面？
Who was behind her?

1181
01:41:40,351 --> 01:41:41,147
我
l was

1182
01:41:42,220 --> 01:41:43,187
發生什麼事？
What happened?

1183
01:41:44,722 --> 01:41:47,282
不知道，她突然摔下去
l don't know. She just went down

1184
01:41:48,393 --> 01:41:50,884
滑倒，我看到
She slipped. l saw it

1185
01:41:52,797 --> 01:41:54,958
娜美離她很遠
Nomi wasn't even close to her

1186
01:42:12,717 --> 01:42:14,014
多倒楣
Tough break, huh?

1187
01:42:17,288 --> 01:42:18,346
什麼事？
What's wrong?

1188
01:42:18,723 --> 01:42:19,985
沒什麼
Nothing

1189
01:42:40,378 --> 01:42:43,006
謝謝，有消息請通知我
Thanks. Keep me informed

1190
01:42:44,249 --> 01:42:47,150
她腦部受震盪，無大礙
She has a concussion. That'll be all right

1191
01:42:47,518 --> 01:42:49,918
但臀部嚴重斷骨
But she has a compound fracture of the hip

1192
01:42:50,622 --> 01:42:52,590
康復極費時日
Those take forever to heal

1193
01:42:53,992 --> 01:42:55,254
必須關閉
We have to shut down

1194
01:42:55,660 --> 01:42:58,595
無論如何得表演下去
Not a chance. The show goes on

1195
01:42:59,063 --> 01:43:02,396
星塵是不夜天，從沒試過關閉
The Stardust is never dark. lt has never been

1196
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:05,268
只要我活著，決不關閉
lt never will be. Not while l am alive

1197
01:43:06,638 --> 01:43:07,900
誰是後補？
Who was her understudy?

1198
01:43:09,107 --> 01:43:10,699
我們有位小姐…
We had a girl who...

1199
01:43:11,743 --> 01:43:13,005
笑什麼？
What's funny?

1200
01:43:13,077 --> 01:43:17,275
姬絲桃是位明星，無可取代
Cristal Connors is a star, Sam! You can't just replace her

1201
01:43:22,387 --> 01:43:25,618
我們聘人暫代，等她康復
We could bring someone in while she's out

1202
01:43:25,690 --> 01:43:27,055
可能要等一年
She could be out for a year

1203
01:43:27,125 --> 01:43:28,319
聘誰？
Like who?

1204

珍納積遜、寶拉阿都

上我的節目？
Paula Abdul? ln my show?

1206
01:43:32,463 --> 01:43:35,455
酬金過巨，我們付不起
We're not paying those kind of salaries

1207
01:43:35,566 --> 01:43:39,559
既然如此，我們依照賭城作風…
ln that case, Mr. Karlman, we do what we do in Vegas

1208
01:43:41,339 --> 01:43:42,931
博一博
We gamble

1209
01:43:45,743 --> 01:43:47,506
各位來賓
Ladies and gentlemen...

你推她下去
You pushed her, didn't you?

1231

沒有
No

1232
01:46:13,524 --> 01:46:16,391
你怎可這樣說？茱莉見到
How can you say that to me? Julie saw it

1233
01:46:16,494 --> 01:46:21,989
不可能，她當時背向你，我在場

01:48:53,084 --> 01:48:54,381
軍事秘密
l'll never tell

1260
01:48:57,388 --> 01:48:58,753
我喜歡你的歌
l like your songs

1261
01:48:59,590 --> 01:49:03,993
我喜歡你的屁股，打電話給我
And l like your ass. Call me

1262
01:49:07,531 --> 01:49:08,896
慕莉…

1263
01:49:09,267 --> 01:49:11,235
安德魯

我連針也執不起來
l can't even thread a needle anymore

1265
01:49:17,942 --> 01:49:18,931
什麼？
Sorry?

1266
01:49:19,777 --> 01:49:21,677
慕莉是你的忠實歌迷
Molly's one of your biggest fans

1267
01:49:22,113 --> 01:49:24,343
既然如此…我替你倒杯酒
Well, then...let me get you a drink

1268
01:49:26,484 --> 01:49:27,382

你今日多美
You look beautiful tonight

1271
01:50:29,980 --> 01:50:30,912
什麼事？
What's going on?

1272
01:50:35,419 --> 01:50:36,943
耍樂一下
Just want to party, baby

1273
01:50:39,690 --> 01:50:40,679
放手！
Let me go!

1274
01:50:41,092 --> 01:50:42,081
抓住她
Get her!

1275
01:50:43,928 --> 01:50:45,657
放手！   他媽的閉嘴！
Let me go! Shut the fuck up!

1276

01:51:11,389 --> 01:51:13,357
我可能愛上你

1283
01:51:42,286 --> 01:51:43,981
我們走吧
Let's get out of here

1284
01:51:50,327 --> 01:51:51,954
慕莉
Molly?

1285
01:51:57,735 --> 01:52:00,966
她受驚過度，已注射鎮定劑
We have her sedated. She's in shock

1286
01:52:01,939 --> 01:52:05,306
鼻樑折斷、陰道破裂

要留醫三、四日

1288
01:52:10,381 --> 01:52:12,008
沙克！

1289
01:52:38,509 --> 01:52:39,703
看這個
Look at this

1290
01:52:40,077 --> 01:52:42,910
還有這個，稍後見
And look at this. Later

1291
01:52:43,314 --> 01:52:45,407
員警呢？   不會來
Where are the police? They're not here

1292
01:52:45,483 --> 01:52:48,111
為什麼？   不來就不來
Why not? Because they're not coming!

1293
01:52:52,089 --> 01:52:53,647
不要報警…
Don't do it...

1294
01:52:53,724 --> 01:52:54,713
寶麗
Polly

1295
01:53:03,133 --> 01:53:04,828
你怎知道？
How did you find out?

1296
01:53:05,202 --> 01:53:08,069
你曾在殷殷會所被捕
You were busted at a fight at the Crave Club

1297
01:53:08,172 --> 01:53:09,799
警方有你指紋
The police took your fingerprints

1298
01:53:11,475 --> 01:53:12,567
我不想聽
l won't listen to this

1299
01:53:12,643 --> 01:53:14,702
不由你不聽！
Yes, you will!

1300
01:53:17,615 --> 01:53:19,674
你叫寶麗安！
You're Polly Ann Costello!

1301
01:53:19,750 --> 01:53:22,014
父親殺死母親後自殺！
Your father killed your mother, then killed himself!

1302
01:53:22,887 --> 01:53:26,220
你被收養，一九九零年出走
You ran away from a foster home in Oakland in 1990!

1303
01:53:26,290 --> 01:53:28,986
案底：科州責淫…  別說！
Arrests: Denver, soliciting... Stop it!

1304
01:53:29,059 --> 01:53:32,995
加州、懷州賣淫！讀下去好嗎？
San Jose, Cheyenne, soliciting! Shall l read the rest?

1305
01:53:33,063 --> 01:53:37,466
藏可卡因、持械行兇
Possession of crack cocaine! Assault with a deadly weapon!

1306
01:53:39,003 --> 01:53:42,268
為什麼不繼續當娼？
Tell me something. Why did you stop hooking?

1307
01:53:42,673 --> 01:53:45,699
你反正已確定人生路向
You had your future pretty well mapped out

1308
01:53:47,778 --> 01:53:49,370
我不得已
l did what l had to do

1309
01:53:50,514 --> 01:53:52,505
就像你對付姬絲桃？
Just like you did with Cristal

1310
01:53:55,352 --> 01:53:56,910
我不是娼妓
l'm not a whore

1311
01:53:59,089 --> 01:54:02,547
你不是
No...you're not

1312
01:54:04,128 --> 01:54:06,221
你會成為紅星
You're going to be a big star

1313
01:54:07,798 --> 01:54:10,266
街上掛著你的大型海報

1314
01:54:11,068 --> 01:54:14,697
你會替星塵賺大錢
And you will make a lot of money for the Stardust

1315
01:54:30,321 --> 01:54:32,687
你放過安德魯？
You'd let him get away with this?

1316
01:54:33,223 --> 01:54:35,691
他今年在天堂酒店演唱
Andrew Carver is at the Paradiso this year

1317
01:54:35,993 --> 01:54:38,894
明年或在星塵
He might be at the Stardust next year

1318
01:54:38,963 --> 01:54:41,261
他是自己人，你也是
He's part of the team. So are you

1319
01:54:44,835 --> 01:54:46,393
慕莉呢？
What about Molly?

1320
01:54:47,071 --> 01:54:50,734
他會賠錢，慕莉可開時裝店
l'll see he gives her enough money to have a dress shop

1321
01:54:54,378 --> 01:54:55,640
告訴我
Tell me something

1322
01:54:57,414 --> 01:54:59,075
你收費多少？
What did you charge?

1323
01:55:01,151 --> 01:55:02,812
賣淫的收費
Hooking

1324

五十元，有時一百元
Fifty. A hundred sometimes

1325
01:55:12,162 --> 01:55:15,928
自貶身價，你的功夫著實一流
You got low self-esteem, baby. You're a fantastic fuck

1326
01:55:26,010 --> 01:55:28,137
我在讚賞你啊
l was paying you a compliment

1327
01:56:03,781 --> 01:56:06,215
夠鐘演出

01:56:27,604 --> 01:56:29,936
打扮得好
Hello, baby. Looking good

1330
01:56:30,541 --> 01:56:31,872
他在等候你
He's ready for you

1331
01:56:46,056 --> 01:56:47,819
你來得快
lt didn't take you long

1332
01:56:57,735 --> 01:56:59,896
我喜歡你無上裝
l like you better topless

1333
01:57:01,672 --> 01:57:04,505
等一等我無下裝
Wait till you see me bottomless

1334
01:57:09,313 --> 01:57:11,247
我正在等

1335
01:57:46,483 --> 01:57:48,007
統統脫掉
Take the rest off

1336
01:57:49,753 --> 01:57:51,482
得
Sure

1337
01:57:58,796 --> 01:58:01,594
你出聲，我捅死你！
You make a sound, l'll fucking kill you!

1338
01:58:02,065 --> 01:58:03,828
好
Okay, okay

1339
01:58:18,615 --> 01:58:21,379
賤種！
Fucker! Fuck off!

1340
01:58:32,930 --> 01:58:34,522
別打擾，他想睡覺
He says he wants to sleep

1341
01:58:34,865 --> 01:58:36,856
筋疲力竭
Tired him out, huh?

1342
01:58:54,418 --> 01:58:57,216
藥物關係，她仍未清醒
She's still out. lt's the medication

1343
01:58:59,389 --> 01:59:00,617
她平安嗎？
ls she okay?

1344
01:59:00,991 --> 01:59:02,652
平安
She's okay

1345
01:59:14,271 --> 01:59:18,264
慕莉
Molly?

1346
01:59:24,781 --> 01:59:28,185
我剛去找過安德魯…
l just went to Carver...

1347
01:59:28,185 --> 01:59:31,951
把他踢得不似人形
and kicked the shit out of him

1348
01:59:35,826 --> 01:59:37,987
我愛你
l love you

1349
01:59:50,407 --> 01:59:53,308
請問姬絲桃在哪？  319號房

1350
02:00:01,351 --> 02:00:04,047
記得我的金石良言嗎？
You know the best advice l ever gave you?

1351
02:00:05,255 --> 02:00:07,553
最後剩下你的話…

到此為止

1355
02:00:20,871 --> 02:00:22,202
對不起，姬絲桃

1356
02:00:22,572 --> 02:00:26,474
我明白你多內疚
Yeah. l know just how sorry you are

1357
02:00:28,345 --> 02:00:31,974
我當上主角，也使同一手段
How do you think l got my first lead?

1358
02:00:34,184 --> 02:00:36,812
總會有人更年輕、更野心…
There's always someone younger and hungrier...

1359
02:00:36,920 --> 02:00:40,151
跟著你下樓梯

1360
02:00:41,458 --> 02:00:43,358
為什麼不說我推你？
Why didn't you tell anyone?

1361
02:00:43,694 --> 02:00:47,391
親愛的…我需要歇一歇
Oh, hell, darling...l needed a rest

1362
02:00:47,965 --> 02:00:52,334
況且，我也獲得一大筆賠款
Besides, my lawyers got me a real nice settlement

1363
02:00:55,639 --> 02:00:56,833
我要走了
l have to go

1364
02:00:56,907 --> 02:01:00,001
不給我來個熱吻？
Aren't you going to give me a big kiss?

1365
02:01:38,482 --> 02:01:40,177
再見，親愛的

1366

1367
02:02:10,414 --> 02:02:12,780
上車！快點！

1371
02:02:43,880 --> 02:02:45,370
贏？
Did you win?

1372
02:02:49,119 --> 02:02:50,381
贏了什麼？
What did you win?

02:02:55,459 --> 02:02:56,926
贏回自己

02:02:57,828 --> 02:02:59,896
媽的
Oh, fuck

1378
02:03:09,172 --> 02:03:10,867
留意交通！

還你行李箱好了
Be cool! l'll get your suitcase.

誤會而已，別衝動

1381
02:03:15,612 --> 02:03:22,541
女神娜美

1382
02:03:24,179 --> 02:33:37,179
