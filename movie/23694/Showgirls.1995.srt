143
00:13:09,558 --> 00:13:10,991
请笑纳，姬小姐
Your bouquet, Miss Connors

144
00:13:11,326 --> 00:13:12,918
拍照后收下，行吗？
Can l keep them?

145
00:13:13,762 --> 00:13:17,562
采访完毕！十分感谢各位
Okay, that's it! Thank you very much for coming. Thanks

146
00:13:18,233 --> 00:13:19,495
这边来
This way, Cristal

147
00:13:19,568 --> 00:13:21,160
应该送玫瑰给我
They could have gotten me roses

148
00:13:22,304 --> 00:13:23,794
她多出色，对吗？
She's great, isn't she?

149
00:13:24,206 --> 00:13:25,230
不算差劲
She doesn't suck

150
00:13:25,373 --> 00:13:27,500
姬丝桃找你
Molly! Cristal needs you

151
00:13:27,576 --> 00:13:28,406
跟我来
Come with me

充当我的助手，来
You can be my assistant. Come on

153
00:13:41,423 --> 00:13:42,856

00:13:43,658 --> 00:13:45,250
叫我姬丝桃吧
Cristal, please. And you are? l'm sorry

155
00:13:47,496 --> 00:13:48,861
我叫慕莉
Molly Abrams

156
00:13:48,964 --> 00:13:52,331
胸围太紧，压扁我的乳房
This top is too tight My breasts are getting crushed

157
00:13:52,701 --> 00:13:54,066
我替你放松
l can loosen it for you

158
00:13:54,936 --> 00:13:58,167
这处放松点，别太松
To here, maybe. No, a little less

159
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,301
奶头要罩得稳，以免波涛汹涌
l want my nipples to press, not look like they're levitating

160
00:14:03,745 --> 00:14:05,042
谢谢你，亲爱的
Thanks, darling

161
00:14:12,854 --> 00:14:16,984
你今晚的演出很精彩，姬…小姐

过奖
Thanks, darling

163
00:14:20,362 --> 00:14:22,853
这些花是安德鲁送的？
Andrew Carver sent you these?

164
00:14:22,964 --> 00:14:25,364
既然咭片上是这样写
lf that's what the card says

165
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:27,664
我喜欢安德鲁
l just love him

166
00:14:28,703 --> 00:14:32,298
我朋友娜美，舞蹈艺员 是吗？
This is my friend Nomi. She's a dancer. ls she now?

167
00:14:32,674 --> 00:14:34,369
很有天份
Yes, and she's really good

168
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,036
在哪里跳舞？
Where do you dance, darling?

169
00:14:38,413 --> 00:14:40,005
在猎豹会所
At the Cheetah

170
00:14:41,616 --> 00:14:45,677
我不知你本领多高、有什么本领
l don't know how good you are, or what it is you're good at...

171
00:14:46,021 --> 00:14:49,889
但在猎豹的话，你肯定不是跳舞
but if it's at the Cheetah, it's no dancing, l know that

172
00:14:51,826 --> 00:14:53,350
你知个屁！
You don't know shit!

173
00:14:56,464 --> 00:14:58,898
对不起，姬小姐
l'm sorry, Miss Connors

174
00:14:58,967 --> 00:15:00,867

姬丝桃
Cristal

177
00:15:06,107 --> 00:15:08,007
你朋友的指甲不错
Your friend has nice nails

178
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,843
她自己修甲
She does them herself

179
00:15:11,112 --> 00:15:13,580
也许叫她替我修
Maybe she can do mine sometime

180
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,251
我在这里干活
l work here, okay?

181
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:27,495
不想惹她生气，打破饭碗
l need my paycheck l don't want her pissed at me

182
00:15:27,495 --> 00:15:28,462

对不起
l'm sorry!

184
00:15:34,336 --> 00:15:35,769
离谱
Jesus, Nomi

185
00:15:43,178 --> 00:15:44,941
我载你上班
l'll drive you to work, okay?

186
00:15:45,247 --> 00:15:46,339
不上班
l'm not going

187
00:15:46,648 --> 00:15:47,808
不怕革职？
They'll fire you

188
00:15:48,917 --> 00:15:50,441
无所谓
l don't care

189
00:15:50,518 --> 00:15:52,418
有所谓  无所谓
Yes, you do. No, l don't

190
00:15:55,924 --> 00:15:58,484
我们去吧

Where?

192
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,095
还有哪里？
You know where

193
00:16:30,091 --> 00:16:31,615
她跳得不错
She can dance, can't she?

194
00:16:31,993 --> 00:16:33,392
她自以为不错
She thinks she can

195
00:16:36,698 --> 00:16:38,222
我去跟她跳
l'm gonna go dance with her

196
00:16:39,067 --> 00:16:43,367
上班时间跳舞？不怕老板？
You can't do that. You're working! T.C. will have your ass!

197
00:16:43,672 --> 00:16:45,765
老板在河畔酒店赌骰子
T.C.'s at the Riviera, playing craps

198
00:16:47,942 --> 00:16:50,069
想跳舞吗？  我在跳舞
Want to dance? l am dancing!

199
00:16:50,745 --> 00:16:53,305
想跟我跳吗？  你跳得好？
You want to dance with me? Are you good?

200
00:16:54,082 --> 00:16:56,107
我跳得好
Yeah, l'm good

201
00:16:56,518 --> 00:16:57,985
我买饮品去
l'm going to get a drink

202
00:17:20,442 --> 00:17:22,273
你懂得跳  我没吹牛
You can dance l don't lie

203
00:17:23,244 --> 00:17:24,233
你不懂
You can't

204
00:17:25,213 --> 00:17:26,202
那我在干什么？
Then what am l doing?

205
00:17:28,516 --> 00:17:29,983
挑逗我的细佬
Teasing my dick

206
00:17:30,418 --> 00:17:32,283
你有潜质，我愿教你
You got potential. l could teach you

207
00:17:40,695 --> 00:17:42,720
不算挑逗吧？
l'm not teasing it now, am l?

208
00:17:42,931 --> 00:17:43,659
当心！
Watch it!

209
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:45,896
冷静点
Be cool

210
00:17:45,967 --> 00:17:47,434
你才去冷静！
You be cool, buddy!

211
00:18:01,449 --> 00:18:02,916
娜美！
Nomi!

212
00:18:04,185 --> 00:18:05,948
抓着她！
Hey, you! Hold her!

213
00:18:06,521 --> 00:18:06,953
干什么？
What are you doing?

214
00:18:07,021 --> 00:18:09,455
是她惹起的  去死！
She started it! Fuck you!

215
00:18:09,524 --> 00:18:10,548
你玩完
Party's over

216
00:18:13,395 --> 00:18:15,420
娜美
Malone

217
00:18:16,231 --> 00:18:17,562
你可以走
You're out of here

218
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:20,761
保释文件
Your release papers

219
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:22,131
如何？
Yo, what's up?

220
00:18:23,138 --> 00:18:26,130
我保释你出来，咖啡也不请喝？
l bailed you out! Don't that get me a cup of coffee?

221
00:18:28,076 --> 00:18:30,237
我只提议教你跳舞
All l said was l'd teach you to dance

222
00:18:30,311 --> 00:18:32,108
谁要你教？
l don't need to be taught that

223
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:36,641
故此你想对我说：滚蛋，贱种！
Because you're a bad-ass, saying, ''Back off, motherfucker''

224
00:18:36,718 --> 00:18:37,980
对了
You got that down

225
00:18:38,386 --> 00:18:39,876
滚蛋，贱种！
Back off, motherfucker!

226
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:47,416
你害得我头又痛、细佬又痛…
Know what? My head hurts, my dick hurts...

227
00:18:47,762 --> 00:18:49,491
连饭碗也丢掉
and you got me fired from my job!

228
00:18:49,864 --> 00:18:51,126
认命吧
Shit happens

229
00:18:51,332 --> 00:18:55,268
“认命吧”你只赠我一句警句？
''Shit happens.'' That's what l get? Fucking wisdom?

230
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:58,362
没有其他？  对，只有警句
That's it?! Yeah, you get wisdom

231
00:18:58,773 --> 00:19:03,540
你不仅要我捱打，也要我受气
You're not just a pain in my head and my dick, you're a pain in my ass

232
00:19:03,945 --> 00:19:05,173
做人难，知吗？
Life sucks, you know?

233
00:19:05,246 --> 00:19:08,807
做人难，认命吧，T恤的标语？
''Life sucks.'' ''Shit happens'' Where you get this, off T-shirts?

234
00:19:12,187 --> 00:19:13,677
我只求你请喝咖啡
All l want is a cup of coffee Yeah?

235
00:19:18,226 --> 00:19:19,693
有两毛半吗？
You got a quarter?

236
00:19:21,696 --> 00:19:23,027
自己去买一杯
Buy yourself a cup

237
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,664
阿尔很生气，说你再旷工的话…
Al is pissed! He says if you miss another night...

238
00:19:30,038 --> 00:19:32,700
你怎出来？  他替我保释
How did you get out? He bailed me out

239
00:19:33,274 --> 00:19:34,138
为什么？
Why?

240
00:19:34,876 --> 00:19:36,104
我踢过他祠堂
l kicked him in the nuts

241
00:19:36,444 --> 00:19:39,038
他喜欢你踢？  必定喜欢
He liked it? He must have

242
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,177
娜美…
Nomi...

243
00:19:44,886 --> 00:19:47,582
我的奶子有胀大吗？
Nomi, do my boobs look bigger to you?

244
00:19:48,389 --> 00:19:50,755
嘉米怀疑自己又怀孕
Carmi thinks she's pregnant again

245
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:53,289
你又停经？
Girl, you missed your period again?

246
00:19:53,728 --> 00:19:56,322
不知道，似乎没停过
l don't know. l don't think so

247
00:19:56,431 --> 00:19:59,127
大批日本客杀到！
lt's like a Japanese convention out there!

248
00:19:59,467 --> 00:20:00,456
唏，妈咪！
Hey, Mama!

249
00:20:01,536 --> 00:20:03,970
准备好有味笑话没有？
Better get your ''little weenie'' jokes ready

250
00:20:05,306 --> 00:20:08,798
机关又失灵，帮帮忙
This thing ain't working again. Come on!

251
00:20:08,877 --> 00:20:09,901
给我拍一拍
Here we go. Come on

252
00:20:09,978 --> 00:20:12,913
加把劲，再拍一拍！
One more time. Try harder. Harder!

253
00:20:14,148 --> 00:20:15,046
让我试试
Let me try it

254
00:20:21,956 --> 00:20:23,548
这位是喜望
l want you to meet Hope

255
00:20:24,726 --> 00:20:28,184
规矩点，这位是蝶芬妮…
Cut it out. Hope, this is Tiffany...

256
00:20:28,296 --> 00:20:31,197
花拉、希迪、亨莉…
Farrah, Heather, Henrietta...

257
00:20:31,266 --> 00:20:33,757
我叫小仙，不是喜望
My name isn't Hope My name is Penny

258
00:20:38,306 --> 00:20:41,400
小仙不好听，引不起性欲
They want class They don't want to fuck a Penny

259
00:20:41,743 --> 00:20:45,406
客人要操的是希迪、蝶芬妮…
They want to fuck a Heather or a Tiffany

260
00:20:45,713 --> 00:20:47,078
或喜望
Or a Hope

261
00:20:48,516 --> 00:20:49,813
这里讲究气派
This is a class joint

262
00:20:50,218 --> 00:20:51,378
亨莉！
Henry!

263
00:20:51,853 --> 00:20:54,083
各位男嘉宾、及少数的女嘉宾…
Gentlemen, and you few ladies out there

264
00:20:54,155 --> 00:20:57,488
你们期望的波后：亨莉！
what you've been waiting for Henrietta, the Queen of Bazooms!

265
00:21:13,975 --> 00:21:17,001
亨莉！拉高你的裙子！
Hey, Henrietta! Pull your dress up!

266
00:21:17,445 --> 00:21:21,279
你哪是我的对手？这样多肥膏…
Honey, you couldn't handle me With all this fat...

267
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:25,519
那活宝在哪里，你决找不到
you'd never even find the thing

268
00:21:27,522 --> 00:21:30,650
我向你撒尿，你或找得到
l'd have to piss on you to give you a clue

269
00:21:33,394 --> 00:21:34,486
不够粉红色
You need more pink

270
00:21:35,463 --> 00:21:36,487
谢谢你，希迪
Thanks, Heather

271
00:21:38,866 --> 00:21:41,096
跳过“坐怀舞”没有？
Have you ever done a lap dance before?

272
00:21:43,471 --> 00:21:45,029
说服客人让你跳
You talk them into it

273
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,508
每趟五十元，在后房跳
Fifty bucks a pop, you do it in the back

274
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:50,209
客人眼看手勿动
Touch and go. They touch, they go

275
00:21:50,645 --> 00:21:52,840
你可摸客人，客人不可摸你
You can touch them They cannot touch you

276
00:21:54,115 --> 00:21:55,241
真好
That's good

277
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,574
胯内射精，可以
lf they come, that's okay

278
00:21:57,885 --> 00:22:00,445
客人拔出来射，你叫巡场来
lf they take it out and come all over you, call the bouncer

279
00:22:00,521 --> 00:22:03,820
若客人肯打赏，无关系
But if he gives you a big tip, then it's okay

280
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,389
明白吗？
Got that?

281
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:15,400
你，昨晚去了哪里？

如假包换的衰人

433
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:29,475
我只管节目的演出…

437
00:38:39,052 --> 00:38:42,146

448
00:39:11,551 --> 00:39:13,644
修理耳朵后再来

493
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:58,315
你的乳头有不妥吗？

498
00:42:27,547 --> 00:42:29,412
你干吗还未坚挺？
Why aren't you erect?

00:42:33,286 --> 00:42:36,187
接着，敷冰

512
00:43:40,654 --> 00:43:45,990
抹鼻
Wipe your nose

513
00:43:55,869 --> 00:43:57,700
牙医会议的人在那边！
The orthodontist convention is over there!

514
00:43:57,771 --> 00:44:00,001
地产会议二十分后开！
Realtors come in 20 minutes!

515
00:44:11,985 --> 00:44:13,111
你来干什么？
What are you doing here?

516
00:44:13,687 --> 00:44:15,211
刚参加试舞
l just had an audition

517
00:44:15,689 --> 00:44:17,247
想当舞蹈艺员？

518
00:44:17,624 --> 00:44:19,717
占士，快去搬行李箱！

519
00:44:21,695 --> 00:44:23,356
试舞不顺利？

520
00:44:25,765 --> 00:44:26,925
我很高兴

523
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,405
舞蹈团不适合你
You don't want to be in this kind of show

524
00:44:36,309 --> 00:44:38,743
脱衣舞起码担白
At least what you do is honest

525
00:44:38,812 --> 00:44:41,212
观众要看胸臀，你就露胸露臀
They want tits and ass, that's what you give

526
00:44:41,548 --> 00:44:46,178
舞蹈团假充艺术，仍靠露胸露臀
Here, they pretend they want something else, you still show tits and ass

527
00:44:46,286 --> 00:44:50,052
要勾搭她，用你私人时间
You want to work her, work her on your own time

528
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:51,618
我在跟她谈话
l'm talking to her

529
00:44:53,727 --> 00:44:57,128
我在跟她谈话，并非勾搭她
l said l'm talking to her l'm not working her

530
00:44:57,230 --> 00:45:01,633
你打扰我，很无礼，给我滚！
You're interrupting me and that's rude Get the fuck out of here!

531
00:45:02,836 --> 00:45:04,030
贱种
Asshole

532
00:45:04,604 --> 00:45:05,662
革你职！
You're fired!

533
00:45:06,072 --> 00:45:07,767
拿着！
Take this!

534
00:45:09,642 --> 00:45:11,872

Now look what you did. You got me fired again

535
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:15,513
你的确无可药救，不知羞
You're a real bad-ass. You got no shame

536
00:45:16,983 --> 00:45:21,613
天朗气清、阳光灿烂、财源滚滚
Look what a beautiful day it is. The sun is shining, money's flowing

537
00:45:22,255 --> 00:45:25,747
我要替你解闷，请你吃超级大餐
l'm going to cheer you up. l'll get you the best meal in town

538
00:45:31,164 --> 00:45:32,426
津津有味
You like that burger!

539
00:45:34,467 --> 00:45:35,695
你从哪处来？
Where are you from?

540
00:45:36,503 --> 00:45:37,765
从各处来
Different Places

541
00:45:39,773 --> 00:45:42,674
你倒也乐意公开自己的事
You like talking about you, huh?

542
00:45:54,721 --> 00:45:56,086
什么地方？  我的家
Where are we? My place

543
00:45:57,390 --> 00:45:58,618
来干什么？
Why?

544
00:45:58,691 --> 00:46:00,022
我想给你看点东西
l want to show you something

545
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:11,001
顶级套房，我千辛万苦才租到
Best suite in town l had to beg and plead to get it

546
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:18,709
想给我看什么？
This what you wanted me to see?

547
00:46:19,512 --> 00:46:22,447
什么事？这张大床？
What? This nice, big bed here?

548
00:46:25,785 --> 00:46:29,084
这首曲我为你而作
l wrote this number. lt's about you

549
00:46:29,622 --> 00:46:31,317
你对我一无所知
You know nothing about me

550
00:46:31,624 --> 00:46:33,421
我知你肯私人表演
l know you're a private dancer

551
00:46:35,762 --> 00:46:37,889
凑足三个舞娘就行
l only need three other girls

552
00:46:38,531 --> 00:46:40,863
我们可到殷殷会所登台
We can put it on at the Crave Club

553
00:46:42,035 --> 00:46:43,468
让我示范
l'll show you

554
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:46,531
站在这里看
Stand right here. Watch me

555
00:46:51,344 --> 00:46:54,074
慢点！这样吗？
Wait a minute, slow down! Like this?

556
00:47:08,962 --> 00:47:11,795
跟我跳，你跟得上
Follow me. l know you can

557
00:48:32,245 --> 00:48:33,735
我有月经
l have my period

558
00:48:34,614 --> 00:48:36,377
还用说
Yeah, right

559
00:48:36,449 --> 00:48:38,246
摸一摸
Check

560
00:48:43,356 --> 00:48:44,516

00:58:01,313 --> 00:58:03,178
我几时开始表演？
How long before l can do the show?

702
00:58:03,249 --> 00:58:04,238
今晚开始
You start tonight

703
00:58:06,318 --> 00:58:08,149
今晚？  你应付得来
Tonight? You'll be fine

704
00:58:11,657 --> 00:58:12,851
她的表现如何？
How did she do?

705
00:58:12,925 --> 00:58:13,949
并非花拳绣腿
She's no butterfly

706
00:58:15,394 --> 00:58:19,831
腰有挺劲，浑身野性
She's all pelvic thrust. She prowls. She's got it

707
00:58:19,899 --> 00:58:21,264
哪处来的野性？
l wonder how she got it?

708
00:58:21,634 --> 00:58:22,999
不是学来的
She didn't learn it

709
00:58:23,068 --> 00:58:25,434
是学来的，但并非从课堂学来
She learned it, but it's not taught in any class

710
00:58:28,274 --> 00:58:30,435
多点橙色，我替你涂
You need more orange. Let me do it

711
00:58:33,179 --> 00:58:34,339
觉得怎样？
How do you feel?

712
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,547
不要问！
Don't ask. Don't ask!

713
00:58:37,383 --> 00:58:38,543
我的化妆品呢？
Who took my make-up?

714
00:58:38,617 --> 00:58:40,949
猩猩来了！
Monkey alert! Monkey alert!

715
00:58:44,657 --> 00:58:46,591
早叫你看管猩猩！
Damn it, Hector! l told you!

716
00:58:46,859 --> 00:58:48,827
猩猩春情动，要生孩子！
They get the heat! They make babies!

717
00:58:48,894 --> 00:58:49,918
孩子？
Babies?

718
00:58:51,597 --> 00:58:52,495
赶出去
Oh, get it out

719
00:58:52,832 --> 00:58:53,799
小心
Watch it

720
00:58:56,669 --> 00:58:58,637
走！   抓着那猩猩！
Go! Go! Grab her!

721
00:58:59,104 --> 00:59:00,765
我抓着一头！
Hey! l got one!

722
00:59:02,341 --> 00:59:03,467
其余在楼上
The rest are upstairs

723
00:59:03,542 --> 00:59:06,477
淫妇，不准再碰我的化妆品！
Julie, you slut, don't touch my make-up!

724
00:59:06,545 --> 00:59:09,139
淫妇？你操那送外卖的小子！
l'm a slut? You fucked that pizza place kid!

725
00:59:09,215 --> 00:59:10,341
你操那抄表汉子！
You fucked the meter reader!

726
00:59:10,649 --> 00:59:13,015
泼货！   你活得不耐烦
Bitch! You're fucking dead!

727
00:59:15,321 --> 00:59:17,346
安妮，停手
Jesus, Annie, get off her!

728
00:59:17,756 --> 00:59:19,690
茱莉，冷静点
Julie! Calm down! Stop it!

729
00:59:20,226 --> 00:59:22,626
打架到此为止
Now settle down! lt's done!

730
00:59:25,464 --> 00:59:26,761
够钟演出
Showtime

731
00:59:27,499 --> 00:59:29,899
去！四个八拍！
Move! You got four counts of eight!

732
00:59:29,969 --> 00:59:31,300
等一等，假发
Nomi, wait. Your wig

733
00:59:32,872 --> 00:59:34,737
你应付得来，大家上去！
You're fine. Let's move up, you guys!

734
00:59:34,807 --> 00:59:35,967
舞台上有粪便
There's shit on the stage

735
00:59:36,876 --> 00:59:39,242
猩猩吃完蒜头总拉粪
They always shit. lt's that garlic

736
00:59:39,311 --> 00:59:40,869
粪便在哪？  左后边
Where? Top left

737
00:59:40,946 --> 00:59:43,642
左后舞台有猩猩粪，去！
Upstage left, monkey shit. Let's go!

738
00:59:43,949 --> 00:59:45,041

Want some blow?

739
00:59:45,684 --> 00:59:47,276
敷冰的最后机会
Last chance for ice

740
00:59:49,722 --> 00:59:54,989

大家快点！娜美，跑！

744
01:00:13,345 --> 01:00:14,369

745
01:00:15,281 --> 01:00:19,081
第二拍，一、二…去！
Two beats. One, two...go!

746
01:00:29,595 --> 01:00:30,857

戴上去，行
Put this on. You're done

754
01:02:43,417 --> 01:02:46,386
我没摔倒  差点摔倒

755
01:02:46,453 --> 01:02:47,511
喂！
Hey, yo!

756
01:02:48,355 --> 01:02:49,583
谈谈行吗？
Can l talk to you a minute?

757
01:02:50,824 --> 01:02:51,984
求求你
Come on, please?

758
01:02:53,293 --> 01:02:54,157
谈吧
Talk

759
01:02:54,695 --> 01:02:55,719
单独谈
Alone?

760
01:02:57,030 --> 01:02:58,930
我去开车  我很快来
l'll get the car. Be right there

761
01:03:03,737 --> 01:03:04,897
谁送的花？
Who sent you the flowers?

762
01:03:07,274 --> 01:03:08,502
不关你事
None of your business

763
01:03:09,576 --> 01:03:12,374
我只想说…
Okay. l just wanted to say...

764
01:03:12,479 --> 01:03:14,174
你我间没有瓜葛
You and me ain't got no ties

765
01:03:19,753 --> 01:03:21,687
我承认好色
l have a problem with pussy

766
01:03:22,189 --> 01:03:24,885
一向如此，改不了
l always have, and l always will

767
01:03:25,225 --> 01:03:26,351
但我言出由衷
But l meant what l said

768
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:30,420
我才不管 那首曲确为你而作
l don't care about your problems. l did write it for you

769
01:03:32,199 --> 01:03:35,566
但我答应过教她，也搞上她
But l did tell her l would teach her, and l did fuck her

770
01:03:36,236 --> 01:03:39,262
你搞上谁是你的事，不关我事
Who you fuck is your business l won't make it mine

771
01:03:41,175 --> 01:03:44,542
那首曲既然赚不了钱…
lt's not like l'm seeing any money for writing that number

772
01:03:45,679 --> 01:03:48,170
我顺便用来泡女人
l may as well touch a little pussy

773
01:03:50,818 --> 01:03:52,786
你没话说？
You got nothing to say

774
01:03:53,554 --> 01:03:54,919

No

775

谢谢你的花

东尼赞你跳得好
Tony said you did great!

777
01:04:00,928 --> 01:04:02,725
我从没接过花
l never got flowers before

778
01:04:03,931 --> 01:04:06,729
我肯定陆续有来
l'm sure you'll get lots of them

779
01:04:08,936 --> 01:04:10,198
他送的花？
He gave them to you?

780
01:04:11,271 --> 01:04:12,465
对
Yeah, he did

781
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:15,333
干什么职业？扯皮条？
What is he? A pimp?

782
01:04:15,809 --> 01:04:18,243
那是部扯皮条型的汽车
Only people with pimp cars are pimps

783
01:04:18,779 --> 01:04:21,077
他是娱乐总监
He's the entertainment director

784
01:04:21,148 --> 01:04:23,013
果然是扯皮条
That's what l said. He's a pimp!

785
01:04:23,383 --> 01:04:24,543
我们走吧
Let's go!

786
01:04:28,088 --> 01:04:30,022
祝你好运
Good luck with your number

好吧
Okay

798

你我一直有点误会
We got off on the wrong foot

799
01:05:37,758 --> 01:05:39,817
不记前嫌，和解如何？
Want to start dancing all over again?

800
01:05:40,861 --> 01:05:42,795
为什么和解？

比狗粮难吃

01:08:40,173 --> 01:08:41,834
我觉得像娼妓
lt made me feel like a hooker

845
01:08:42,209 --> 01:08:43,836
你是娼妓啊
You are a whore, darling

846
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:45,309
我不是
l'm not!

847
01:08:45,378 --> 01:08:46,811
我们都是
We all are

848
01:08:47,214 --> 01:08:51,981
我们赚钱，全靠迎合观众的爱好
We take the cash, we cash the check, we show them what they want to see

849
01:08:52,052 --> 01:08:54,782
也许你是娼妓，我不是
Maybe you're a whore, but l'm not

850
01:08:57,958 --> 01:09:00,290
你与我…
You and me...

851
01:09:00,393 --> 01:09:03,885
都是同一种人
we're exactly alike

852
01:09:12,005 --> 01:09:14,371
我怎也不会似你
l'll never be like you

853
01:09:18,945 --> 01:09:23,143
姬小姐，麻烦你签个名，行吗？
Miss Connors! Sorry to bother you Would you sign this for me?

854
01:09:23,216 --> 01:09:25,377
乐意，大名是什么？
Happy to. What's your name?

855
01:09:25,452 --> 01:09:27,784
法兰，来自德州
Frank. l'm from Galveston

856
01:09:28,321 --> 01:09:30,881
我也是德州人
l'm from Del Rio myself, Frank

857
01:09:30,957 --> 01:09:34,051
我早说过她是德州人，瞧！
l told you she was from Texas. Whoo-ee, look at that!

858
01:09:34,928 --> 01:09:36,520
也替我签，行吗？
Could l have one like that?

859
01:09:36,897 --> 01:09:39,695
你不想印干我的口红吧？
You want a girl to use up all her lipstick on you?

860
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:42,968
想跳舞吗？   现在跳？
Want to dance? Right now?

861
01:09:43,336 --> 01:09:45,964
正如猫王那首歌：“机不可失”
lt's now or never. That's what Elvis said

862
01:09:50,343 --> 01:09:53,210
我听过句金石良言…
You know the best advice l ever got?

863
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:57,046
你渴望得到一个舞台空缺…
You're up there onstage, hoping on a spot

864
01:09:57,417 --> 01:10:00,750
不妨把所有对手，逐个踩下台
lf someone gets in your way, step on them

865
01:10:01,288 --> 01:10:05,281
最后剩下你，空缺非你莫属
lf you're the only one left standing there, they hire you

866
01:10:05,992 --> 01:10:08,654
我想说的已说完，谢谢
That's about it. Thank you and good night

867
01:10:08,762 --> 01:10:11,663
到此为止
Elvis has left the building

868
01:11:17,898 --> 01:11:19,957
亲爱的，看吧…
You see, darling...

869
01:11:20,066 --> 01:11:22,000
你是娼妓
you are a whore

870
01:11:24,971 --> 01:11:26,438
贱人！
Bitch!

871
01:11:31,478 --> 01:11:33,605
大概已闹翻
Guess we're done

872
01:11:45,659 --> 01:11:47,422
妮奇，我有话跟你说
Nicky, can l talk to you for a second?

873
01:11:55,368 --> 01:11:57,836
妈，看猴子行吗？  现在不行
Mommy, can we see the monkeys? Not now

874
01:11:58,204 --> 01:12:01,308
求求你  猴子要工作
Please. They're so cute. They have to work

875
01:12:01,308 --> 01:12:02,741
什么工作？
What are they doing?

876
01:12:02,809 --> 01:12:04,936
我要看猴子！   现在不行
l want to see the monkeys! Not now

877
01:12:05,011 --> 01:12:06,410
为什么？
Why not?

878
01:12:06,479 --> 01:12:08,470
赶他妈的小孩出去
Get these fucking kids out of here

879
01:12:09,416 --> 01:12:12,214
你说粗口！她说粗口
You said the F'' word! She said the ''F'' word''

880
01:12:12,585 --> 01:12:13,779
她说粗口
She said the F'' word!''

881
01:12:13,853 --> 01:12:15,480
他妈的闭嘴！
Shut the fuck up!

882
01:12:23,263 --> 01:12:24,890
不要怕
lt's okay. lt's okay

883
01:12:26,666 --> 01:12:30,602
下星期本城举行游艇展览会
Nomi, a boat convention's coming into town next week

884
01:12:30,704 --> 01:12:32,839

一千元？干什么？
A thousand dollars? To do what?

887
01:12:41,014 --> 01:12:45,542
替酒店宣传，花枝招展地拍照
Represent the hotel. You wear your costume, smile, they take your picture

888
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:48,185

对不起，有些人真不知所谓
l'm sorry. Some people just don't get it

936
01:16:08,521 --> 01:16:11,684
我在台上，叫菲腊来

她未搞清楚就乱跳

MBA是工管硕士，没实际用场
An MBA is a college degree. lt's mostly worthless in the real world

957
01:17:28,935 --> 01:17:30,527

他拼命宣传自己是异性恋

拿电筒照照他的行头多大
Molly, bring that flashlight so l can see how big it is

973
01:18:39,906 --> 01:18:41,931
想吃老拳吗？
You want a knuckle sandwich?

974
01:18:42,275 --> 01:18:44,539
我用后门吃，行吗？

975
01:18:44,610 --> 01:18:46,544
别吵了！离谱

lt's her knee

984
01:20:28,981 --> 01:20:30,141
碎了，对吗？
lt isn't broken, is it?

985
01:20:30,716 --> 01:20:32,183
什么回事？
Daryl, what happened?

986
01:20:32,585 --> 01:20:34,143
我一时脚滑
My foot went out from under me

987
01:20:36,389 --> 01:20:38,254
是这一回事
This is what happened

988
01:20:41,594 --> 01:20:43,323
怎会在舞台上出现？
l wonder how those got up here?

989
01:20:43,963 --> 01:20:45,794
或许从服饰脱落
Probably came off a costume

990
01:20:46,165 --> 01:20:48,030
我们送你入院
We'll get you to the hospital

991
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:49,397
好痛
Shit, no!

992
01:20:49,469 --> 01:20:52,905
可怜的安妮，多倒霉
Jesus. Poor Annie. Tough break

993
01:20:53,272 --> 01:20:54,296
请挪开
Let us through here

994
01:20:58,878 --> 01:21:00,038
稍后见
See you later

995
01:21:01,747 --> 01:21:02,736
我是监制
l'm the producer

996
01:21:02,815 --> 01:21:05,443
你是我雇员，听我命令
l hired you! You do what l say

997
01:21:05,518 --> 01:21:08,180
安妮是我的候补，我有发言权
She was my understudy. l have a say, too

998
01:21:08,254 --> 01:21:10,790
但决策权不在你处
Yeah, but guess who makes the decision

999
01:21:10,790 --> 01:21:12,155
她的膝盖碎了
lt's broken, kids

1000
01:21:12,758 --> 01:21:15,595
惨，要三个月才复原
Shit. That will be three months

1001
01:21:15,595 --> 01:21:16,391
起码
At least

1002
01:21:19,165 --> 01:21:20,530
报应
Bad karma, huh?

1003
01:21:20,833 --> 01:21:22,630
娜美，你妈妈在等你
Nomi, your mother's waiting for you

1004
01:21:23,603 --> 01:21:24,900
我的妈妈？
My mother?

1005
01:21:25,438 --> 01:21:28,635
为你着想，我希望她不是
For your sake, l hope she's not

1006
01:21:30,610 --> 01:21:32,874
醒睡的人易睡醒…
lf a light sleeper sleeps with a light on

1007
01:21:32,945 --> 01:21:34,970
挺硬的人可硬挺？
Can a hard sleeper sleep with a hard on?

1008
01:21:35,281 --> 01:21:39,411
雌老虎哪处厉害？两个吃人的口
What do you call a tiger? A big pussy that eats people

1009
01:21:39,485 --> 01:21:40,577
亨莉！
Henry!

1010
01:21:43,723 --> 01:21:46,521
吻出口水，好过喷出口水
l can get shit on, but l don't like getting spit on

1011
01:21:49,362 --> 01:21:50,522
阿尔
Hi, Al

1012
01:21:51,397 --> 01:21:52,591
你难看极
You look like shit

1013
01:21:53,266 --> 01:21:56,133
十吋阳具也不及她好看
She looks better than a 10-inch dick and you know it

1014
01:21:57,803 --> 01:22:00,704
在这里…工作开心吗？
So...do you like it here?

1015
01:22:00,773 --> 01:22:02,138
难道她会怀念你？
What, you think she misses you?

1016
01:22:02,808 --> 01:22:04,241
有什么稀奇？
Yeah, why not?

1017
01:22:04,777 --> 01:22:06,176
我们怀念她
We miss her

1018
01:22:06,279 --> 01:22:10,545
她怀念我们，像我怀念我那痔疮
She misses us like that lump on my twat l had taken off last week

1019
01:22:10,616 --> 01:22:11,844
离谱
Jesus, Henry

1020
01:22:20,026 --> 01:22:21,425
我们看过你演出
We saw the show

1021
01:22:23,095 --> 01:22:24,528
你跳得精彩
You were good

1022
01:22:26,766 --> 01:22:28,097
谢谢你，阿尔
Thank you, Al

1023
01:22:32,905 --> 01:22:34,839
的确精彩
Real good

1024
01:22:38,277 --> 01:22:40,643
保重，小姑娘
You take care, kid

1025
01:22:45,851 --> 01:22:49,912
你没有引死人，着实奇怪
Must be weird, not having anyone come on you

1026
01:22:55,061 --> 01:22:57,928
娜美，要我载吗？
Nomi. Hey, you want a ride?

1027
01:23:00,499 --> 01:23:01,488
我已有人载
l got one

1028
01:23:06,105 --> 01:23:07,333
等一等！
Wait!

1029
01:23:11,477 --> 01:23:12,967
坐过这汽车吗？
Ever been in one of these?

1030
01:23:13,045 --> 01:23:13,875
不
No

1031
01:23:14,814 --> 01:23:16,213
我梦寐以求的事
l always wanted one

1032
01:23:18,484 --> 01:23:20,918
不同凡响吧？   不算差劲
lt's some car, huh? lt doesn't suck

1033
01:23:22,722 --> 01:23:25,088
往哪处去？你带路
Where are we headed? Give me directions

1034
01:23:27,193 --> 01:23:28,558
往你家去
To your place

1035
01:23:48,214 --> 01:23:49,545
你爱喝姬丝桃香槟？
Do you like Cristal?

1036
01:23:50,316 --> 01:23:52,409
我爱喝各种香槟
l like a lot of different champagnes

1037
01:23:53,786 --> 01:23:56,016
但我只喝香槟
But l always drink champagne

1038
01:23:57,723 --> 01:23:59,452
安德鲁是怎样的人？
What's Andrew Carver like?

1039
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:03,060
你紧张？毋须紧张
Are you nervous? Don't be

1040
01:24:04,030 --> 01:24:05,395
我没有紧张
l'm not

1041
01:24:10,603 --> 01:24:12,901
我喜欢你的高潮
l liked it when you came

1042
01:24:16,042 --> 01:24:18,169
喜欢你的眼睛
l liked your eyes

1043
01:27:28,901 --> 01:27:30,493
留下来
Stay with me

1044
01:27:31,237 --> 01:27:32,966
早上我载你回去
l'll drive you back in the morning

1045
01:27:33,305 --> 01:27:34,772
现在是早上
lt is morning

1046
01:27:35,474 --> 01:27:36,736
请留下来
Please?

1047
01:27:36,809 --> 01:27:38,140
我已叫计程车
l have a taxi coming

1048
01:27:38,878 --> 01:27:40,345
取消好了
Send it back

1049
01:27:46,051 --> 01:27:48,212
姬丝桃要位新候补
Cristal needs a new understudy

1050
01:27:49,755 --> 01:27:53,054
中午试舞，可有兴趣？
There's an audition at noon. You want to try?

1051
01:27:54,994 --> 01:27:57,861
我不来这里，你会告诉我吗？
Would you have told me if l hadn't come here?

1052
01:27:58,230 --> 01:28:01,222
提议来的是你，不是我
lt was your idea to come here, not mine

1053
01:28:05,704 --> 01:28:08,002
我想再见你
l want to see you again

1054
01:28:09,241 --> 01:28:10,799
看情形才说
We'll see how it goes

1055
01:28:14,847 --> 01:28:17,077
看什么情形？试舞？
What, the audition?

1056
01:28:26,859 --> 01:28:28,383
十元半
Ten-fifty

1057
01:28:37,536 --> 01:28:38,867
喂！
Hello!

1058
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:42,766
恨死你
l hate you

1059
01:28:43,809 --> 01:28:46,073
对方是谁？   沙克
Who was he? Zack

1060
01:28:46,412 --> 01:28:48,277
还得了
Oh, my God

1061
01:28:48,881 --> 01:28:50,246
有没有缚起他？
Did you tie him up?

1062
01:28:50,683 --> 01:28:51,707
惨
Oh, shit

1063
01:28:52,685 --> 01:28:54,346
我忘记解开他
l forgot to untie him

1064
01:28:59,024 --> 01:29:00,286
吸毒吸醉了？
Are you high?

1065
01:29:00,726 --> 01:29:02,455
有点
Maybe a little

1066
01:29:04,363 --> 01:29:08,766
不能睡，中午要试舞，麦片呢？
l can't go to sleep. l have an audition at noon. Where are the Sugar Snaps?

1067
01:29:09,134 --> 01:29:11,398
在柜里，娜美…
ln the cupboard. Nomi...

1068
01:29:11,804 --> 01:29:13,829
不要上毒瘾
don't get sucked into it

1069
01:29:16,575 --> 01:29:18,133
看我找到什么！
Look what l found!

1070
01:29:20,946 --> 01:29:22,641
随便你好了
Okay, whatever, Nomes

1071
01:29:52,978 --> 01:29:54,172
我选茱莉
Julie

1072
01:29:54,747 --> 01:29:57,580
她不够性感  她舞步熟练
She's not hot enough. She has it down

1073
01:29:57,783 --> 01:30:01,412
但没有姬丝桃的热力
You can teach it. She doesn't have Cristal's heat

1074
01:30:01,754 --> 01:30:03,813
谁也没有
None of them have Cristal's heat

1075
01:30:04,556 --> 01:30:06,285
教我怎不爱你
l do love you, Gay

1076
01:30:06,759 --> 01:30:08,158
娜美有热力
Nomi has heat

1077
01:30:09,762 --> 01:30:10,854
有吗？
Does she?

1078
01:30:11,930 --> 01:30:13,227
娜美有
Yes, she does

1079
01:30:14,733 --> 01:30:16,792
完全不同的热力
ln a totally different way

1080
01:30:17,236 --> 01:30:20,000
说笑！由她当主角？
Come on! She's going to take the lead?

1081
01:30:20,372 --> 01:30:23,136
这是大型节目，不是脱衣舞！
This a hotel show! lt's not the Cheetah!

1082
01:30:23,475 --> 01:30:26,842
不要紧，八年来我从未失场
lt doesn't matter l haven't missed a show in 8 years

1083
01:30:27,212 --> 01:30:29,203
你不会愈来愈年轻
You're not getting any younger

1084
01:30:29,381 --> 01:30:30,609
狗种
Eat me

1085
01:30:31,350 --> 01:30:33,318
看娜美试舞吗？  不
Want to see it again with just Nomi? No

1086
01:30:33,819 --> 01:30:35,753
我看，去准备吧
l do. Set it up, Marty

1087
01:30:35,821 --> 01:30:37,118
不知所谓
This is bullshit

1088
01:30:37,856 --> 01:30:39,346
假公济私
lt's about your dick

1089
01:30:39,725 --> 01:30:40,953
妮奇、茱莉，谢谢
Nicky, Julie, thank you!

1090
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:43,188
有她的资料吗？
What do we know about her?

1091
01:30:43,295 --> 01:30:46,196
全无，连福利证号码也不可靠
Nothing. l doubt her Social Security number's right

1092
01:30:46,265 --> 01:30:47,732
调查她   查什么？
Find out. What?

1093
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:48,892
一切
Everything

1094
01:31:03,482 --> 01:31:05,211
你与她有一手？
You fucked her, didn't you?

1095
01:31:05,784 --> 01:31:10,187
你生气，因为妒忌？抑或…
Are you pissed off because you're jealous?

1096
01:31:10,255 --> 01:31:12,314
因为被我捷足先登？
Or because l beat you to the punch?

1097
01:31:33,579 --> 01:31:37,379
你操他，为空缺？抑或为兴趣？
You fuck him for the spot or because you wanted to?

1098
01:31:40,385 --> 01:31:42,751
我相信，你为空缺
l say you did it for the spot

1099
01:31:43,322 --> 01:31:45,984
你惯用身体作交易？
ls that what you did, Cristal?

1100
01:31:46,592 --> 01:31:50,050
我们既是朋友，激怒我对你无益
You don't want to piss me off, now that we're friends

1101
01:31:50,596 --> 01:31:53,565
你不应动怒
No, you shouldn't get pissed off

1102
01:31:53,866 --> 01:31:55,333
动怒令你衰老
lt makes you look older

1103
01:32:01,073 --> 01:32:04,907
你升为候补
You got it

1104
01:32:05,744 --> 01:32:07,109
真的？
l do?

1105
01:32:08,247 --> 01:32:09,908
马狄与琪会教你
Marty and Gay will work with you

1106
01:32:10,315 --> 01:32:13,648
菲腊会安排宣传，你干得好
Phil will have some glossies taken. You did good

1107
01:32:14,753 --> 01:32:17,153
我们一起进餐、吃龙虾
l'll call you for dinner, lobster

1108
01:32:17,523 --> 01:32:20,219
听过凯撒唱歌吗？保证悦耳
Did you ever hear Caesar sing? You'll love it

1109
01:32:31,203 --> 01:32:32,727
望什么？
What?

1110
01:32:34,406 --> 01:32:37,967
恭喜，原来你多才多艺
Congratulations. l see you have many talents

1111
01:32:38,844 --> 01:32:40,675
我认为她跳得好
l thought she did good

1112
01:32:46,718 --> 01:32:50,552
殷殷会所 占士舞蹈演出
A Private Dance By James Smith The Crave Club

1113
01:33:02,367 --> 01:33:06,463
事后我才知道试舞的事
l didn't know about the audition until afterwards

1114
01:33:09,775 --> 01:33:11,936
我的指甲怎样？
Do you like my nails?

1115
01:33:23,622 --> 01:33:25,817
比不上你的漂亮
They're not as nice as yours

1116
01:33:30,862 --> 01:33:33,387
也许有空我替你修甲
Maybe l'll help you with yours sometime

1117
01:33:38,203 --> 01:33:40,103
你愿意的话
lf you want

1118
01:33:43,108 --> 01:33:46,009
你真好人
lsn't that nice of you, darling?

1119
01:33:46,378 --> 01:33:48,312
我们是朋友嘛
What are friends for?

1120
01:33:56,221 --> 01:33:58,121
想深一层…
On second thought...

1121
01:33:59,925 --> 01:34:02,723
也许不应让你修甲
maybe you shouldn't do mine

1122
01:34:04,162 --> 01:34:08,098
我太老，不适合婊子打扮
l'm getting too old for that whory look

1123
01:34:09,268 --> 01:34:11,202
我会考虑一下
l'll think about it

1124
01:34:14,606 --> 01:34:16,904
出去时关门
Close the door on your way out

1125
01:35:12,097 --> 01:35:14,258
不懂跳舞，不要假充！
Hey, bring on the real dancers!

1126
01:35:16,702 --> 01:35:18,329
嘘！
Boo!

1127
01:35:19,438 --> 01:35:21,167
差劲！
You suck!

1128
01:35:24,543 --> 01:35:26,101
下台！
Get off the stage!

1129
01:35:27,079 --> 01:35:29,479
表演够了！
Enough of this stuff!

1130
01:35:29,881 --> 01:35:31,610
我们跳舞吧！
Let's dance!

1131
01:35:42,828 --> 01:35:46,195
好看、出色
l loved it! lt was good

1132
01:35:46,264 --> 01:35:48,198
你来，不怕失身份？
What are you doing here, slumming?

1133
01:35:48,266 --> 01:35:49,631
希迪！
Heather!

1134
01:35:51,470 --> 01:35:52,437
我们怎样？
Were we good?

1135
01:35:52,537 --> 01:35:53,435
好极
Great

1136
01:35:53,772 --> 01:35:55,069
她跳得笨手笨脚
She dances like a truck!

1137
01:35:55,841 --> 01:35:59,344
怎会！要喝东西吗？
l do not! Do you want something to drink?

1138
01:35:59,344 --> 01:36:00,709
来杯啤酒，婆娘
Yeah. Get me a beer, bitch

1139
01:36:02,781 --> 01:36:04,248
看我的戒指
Look what l got

1140
01:36:06,918 --> 01:36:08,044
真美
lt's beautiful

1141
01:36:08,353 --> 01:36:09,843
我从祖母处偷来
l stole it from my grandmother

1142
01:36:10,322 --> 01:36:13,348
不是！你从当铺处买
You did not! You got it at a pawnshop

1143
01:36:22,267 --> 01:36:23,700
我们快结婚
We're getting married

1144
01:36:26,872 --> 01:36:28,066
你爱她？
You love her?

1145
01:36:29,374 --> 01:36:32,036
不知道，奉子成婚
l don't know. She's having a baby

1146
01:36:36,882 --> 01:36:38,042
演出呢？
And this?

1147
01:36:39,184 --> 01:36:43,644
不受欢迎，观众喝倒采
We ain't any good. You heard them. ''Get off the stage!''

1148
01:36:45,624 --> 01:36:46,716
有什么打算？
What will you do?

1149
01:36:48,627 --> 01:36:52,324
帮外母打理杂货店
Work in a grocery store Her mother owns it

1150
01:36:53,298 --> 01:36:56,358
婴儿食物我们有折扣
We'll get a discount on baby food

1151
01:37:07,712 --> 01:37:08,974
再见
See ya

1152
01:37:12,851 --> 01:37:17,811
认命吧、做人难，对我用得上
Shit happens, you know? Life sucks. l'm a student of T-shirts!

1153
01:37:29,067 --> 01:37:30,534
妮奇
Hey, Nicky

1154
01:37:39,778 --> 01:37:41,143
娜美小姐…
Dear Ms. Malone,

1155
01:37:41,246 --> 01:37:45,546
我们不能选你为后补…万分遗憾
We regret we are unable to offer you...understudy

1156
01:37:58,196 --> 01:37:59,464
不准进去！
You can't go in there!

1157
01:37:59,464 --> 01:38:00,362
什么事？
What's going on?

1158
01:38:00,765 --> 01:38:02,164
“什么事？”
What's going on?!

1159
01:38:02,234 --> 01:38:04,566
冷静点   “冷静点”！
Hey, cool it. Cool it?!

1160
01:38:05,637 --> 01:38:07,264
竟发这封信来！
When you sent me this?!

1161
01:38:07,339 --> 01:38:10,172
她用离职威胁，出动律师
She threatened to walk! She got her lawyers into it!

1162
01:38:10,242 --> 01:38:11,300
又如何？
So what?!

1163
01:38:11,376 --> 01:38:13,674
她是个明星！你及不上
So, she's a star! You're not worth it

1164
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:17,111
对不起，娜美，我已尽力
Sorry, Nomi. l tried. Fuck!

1165
01:38:19,818 --> 01:38:24,517
绳胯断掉，我赤裸裸跳足五分钟
Basically, my G-string snapped. There l was, dancing butt naked for 5 mins

1166
01:38:24,890 --> 01:38:26,482
难为了我的舞伴
l mean, my poor partner!

1167
01:38:29,227 --> 01:38:31,889
我考虑过，亲爱的
l thought about it, darling

1168
01:38:33,732 --> 01:38:35,723
现在替我修甲，行吗？
Think you could do my nails now?

1169
01:38:42,140 --> 01:38:43,368
行
Okay

1170
01:38:43,708 --> 01:38:45,300
或许改天吧
Maybe some other time

1171
01:40:56,941 --> 01:41:00,377
随我来…女奴隶
Come on...slave girl

1172
01:41:04,182 --> 01:41:05,945
五分钟后出场，快！
We've got five minutes. Go!

1173
01:41:08,153 --> 01:41:13,181
大家赶快！
Go, you guys! Run, run!

1174
01:41:19,631 --> 01:41:21,030
让路！
Let me through!

1175
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:23,828
惨！
Shit!

1176
01:41:25,136 --> 01:41:26,603
姬丝桃，你听见我吗？
Cristal, can you hear me?

1177
01:41:27,539 --> 01:41:29,404
叫马狄来！
Somebody get Marty!

1178
01:41:34,412 --> 01:41:35,640
什么事？   不知道
What happened? l don't know

1179
01:41:36,581 --> 01:41:37,946
召救伤车！
Somebody get an ambulance!

1180
01:41:38,550 --> 01:41:39,812
谁在她后面？
Who was behind her?

1181
01:41:40,251 --> 01:41:41,047
我
l was

1182
01:41:42,120 --> 01:41:43,087
发生什么事？
What happened?

1183
01:41:44,622 --> 01:41:47,182
不知道，她突然摔下去
l don't know. She just went down

1184
01:41:48,293 --> 01:41:50,784
滑倒，我看到
She slipped. l saw it

1185
01:41:52,697 --> 01:41:54,858
娜美离她很远
Nomi wasn't even close to her

1186
01:42:12,617 --> 01:42:13,914
多倒霉
Tough break, huh?

1187
01:42:17,188 --> 01:42:18,246
什么事？
What's wrong?

1188
01:42:18,623 --> 01:42:19,885
没什么
Nothing

1189
01:42:40,278 --> 01:42:42,906
谢谢，有消息请通知我
Thanks. Keep me informed

1190
01:42:44,149 --> 01:42:47,050
她脑部受震盪，无大礙
She has a concussion. That'll be all right

1191
01:42:47,418 --> 01:42:49,818
但臀部严重断骨
But she has a compound fracture of the hip

1192
01:42:50,522 --> 01:42:52,490
康复极费时日
Those take forever to heal

1193
01:42:53,892 --> 01:42:55,154
必须关闭
We have to shut down

1194
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:58,495
无论如何得表演下去
Not a chance. The show goes on

1195
01:42:58,963 --> 01:43:02,296
星尘是不夜天，从没试过关闭
The Stardust is never dark. lt has never been

1196
01:43:02,700 --> 01:43:05,168
只要我活着，决不关闭
lt never will be. Not while l am alive

1197
01:43:06,538 --> 01:43:07,800
谁是后补？
Who was her understudy?

1198
01:43:09,007 --> 01:43:10,599
我们有位小姐…
We had a girl who...

1199
01:43:11,643 --> 01:43:12,905
笑什么？
What's funny?

1200
01:43:12,977 --> 01:43:17,175
姬丝桃是位明星，无可取代
Cristal Connors is a star, Sam! You can't just replace her

1201
01:43:22,287 --> 01:43:25,518
我们聘人暂代，等她康复
We could bring someone in while she's out

1202
01:43:25,590 --> 01:43:26,955
可能要等一年
She could be out for a year

1203
01:43:27,025 --> 01:43:28,219
聘谁？

Paula Abdul? ln my show?

1206
01:43:32,363 --> 01:43:35,355
酬金过巨，我们付不起
We're not paying those kind of salaries

1207
01:43:35,466 --> 01:43:39,459
既然如此，我们依照赌城作风…
ln that case, Mr. Karlman, we do what we do in Vegas

1208
01:43:41,239 --> 01:43:42,831
博一博
We gamble

1209
01:43:45,643 --> 01:43:47,406
各位来宾
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:49:13,404 --> 01:49:15,531
我连针也执不起来
l can't even thread a needle anymore

1265
01:49:17,842 --> 01:49:18,831
什么？
Sorry?

1266
01:49:19,677 --> 01:49:21,577
慕莉是你的忠实歌迷
Molly's one of your biggest fans

1267
01:49:22,013 --> 01:49:24,243
既然如此…我替你倒杯酒
Well, then...let me get you a drink

1268
01:49:26,384 --> 01:49:27,282

你今日多美
You look beautiful tonight

1271
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:30,812
什么事？
What's going on?

1272
01:50:35,319 --> 01:50:36,843
耍乐一下
Just want to party, baby

1273
01:50:39,590 --> 01:50:40,579
放手！
Let me go!

1274
01:50:40,992 --> 01:50:41,981
抓住她

1275
01:50:43,828 --> 01:50:45,557
放手！   他妈的闭嘴！

01:51:11,289 --> 01:51:13,257
我可能爱上你
l could fall in love with you

1283
01:51:42,186 --> 01:51:43,881
我们走吧
Let's get out of here

1284
01:51:50,227 --> 01:51:51,854
慕莉
Molly?

1285
01:51:57,635 --> 01:52:00,866
她受惊过度，已注射镇定剂
We have her sedated. She's in shock

1286
01:52:01,839 --> 01:52:05,206
鼻樑折断、阴道破裂

要留医三、四日

1288
01:52:10,281 --> 01:52:11,908
沙克！

1290

还有这个，稍后见
And look at this. Later

1291
01:52:43,214 --> 01:52:45,307
警察呢？   不会来
Where are the police? They're not here

1292
01:52:45,383 --> 01:52:48,011
为什么？   不来就不来
Why not? Because they're not coming!

1293
01:52:51,989 --> 01:52:53,547
不要报警…
Don't do it...

1294
01:52:53,624 --> 01:52:54,613
宝丽
Polly

1295
01:53:03,033 --> 01:53:04,728
你怎知道？
How did you find out?

1296
01:53:05,102 --> 01:53:07,969
你曾在殷殷会所被捕
You were busted at a fight at the Crave Club

1297
01:53:08,072 --> 01:53:09,699
警方有你指纹
The police took your fingerprints

1298
01:53:11,375 --> 01:53:12,467
我不想听
l won't listen to this

1299
01:53:12,543 --> 01:53:14,602
不由你不听！
Yes, you will!

1300
01:53:17,515 --> 01:53:19,574
你叫宝丽安！
You're Polly Ann Costello!

1301
01:53:19,650 --> 01:53:21,914
父亲杀死母亲后自杀！
Your father killed your mother, then killed himself!

1302
01:53:22,787 --> 01:53:26,120
你被收养，一九九零年出走
You ran away from a foster home in Oakland in 1990!

1303
01:53:26,190 --> 01:53:28,886
案底：科州责淫…  别说！
Arrests: Denver, soliciting... Stop it!

1304
01:53:28,959 --> 01:53:32,895
加州、怀州卖淫！读下去好吗？
San Jose, Cheyenne, soliciting! Shall l read the rest?

1305
01:53:32,963 --> 01:53:37,366
藏可卡因、持械行凶
Possession of crack cocaine! Assault with a deadly weapon!

1306
01:53:38,903 --> 01:53:42,168
为什么不继续当娼？
Tell me something. Why did you stop hooking?

1307
01:53:42,573 --> 01:53:45,599
你反正已确定人生路向
You had your future pretty well mapped out

1308
01:53:47,678 --> 01:53:49,270
我不得已
l did what l had to do

1309
01:53:50,414 --> 01:53:52,405
就像你对付姬丝桃？
Just like you did with Cristal

1310
01:53:55,252 --> 01:53:56,810
我不是娼妓
l'm not a whore

1311
01:53:58,989 --> 01:54:02,447
你不是
No...you're not

1312
01:54:04,028 --> 01:54:06,121
你会成为红星
You're going to be a big star

1313
01:54:07,698 --> 01:54:10,166
街上挂着你的大型海报

1314
01:54:10,968 --> 01:54:14,597
你会替星尘赚大钱
And you will make a lot of money for the Stardust

1315
01:54:30,221 --> 01:54:32,587
你放过安德鲁？
You'd let him get away with this?

1316
01:54:33,123 --> 01:54:35,591
他今年在天堂酒店演唱
Andrew Carver is at the Paradiso this year

1317
01:54:35,893 --> 01:54:38,794
明年或在星尘

1318
01:54:38,863 --> 01:54:41,161
他是自己人，你也是
He's part of the team. So are you

1319
01:54:44,735 --> 01:54:46,293
慕莉呢？
What about Molly?

1320
01:54:46,971 --> 01:54:50,634
他会赔钱，慕莉可开时装店
l'll see he gives her enough money to have a dress shop

1321
01:54:54,278 --> 01:54:55,540
告诉我
Tell me something

1322
01:54:57,314 --> 01:54:58,975
你收费多少？
What did you charge?

1323
01:55:01,051 --> 01:55:02,712
卖淫的收费
Hooking

1324

五十元，有时一百元
Fifty. A hundred sometimes

1325
01:55:12,062 --> 01:55:15,828
自贬身价，你的功夫着实一流
You got low self-esteem, baby. You're a fantastic fuck

1326
01:55:25,910 --> 01:55:28,037
我在赞赏你啊

打扮得好
Hello, baby. Looking good

1330
01:56:30,441 --> 01:56:31,772
他在等候你
He's ready for you

1331
01:56:45,956 --> 01:56:47,719
你来得快
lt didn't take you long

1332
01:56:57,635 --> 01:56:59,796
我喜欢你无上装
l like you better topless

1333
01:57:01,572 --> 01:57:04,405
等一等我无下装
Wait till you see me bottomless

1334
01:57:09,213 --> 01:57:11,147
我正在等

1335
01:57:46,383 --> 01:57:47,907
统统脱掉
Take the rest off

1336
01:57:49,653 --> 01:57:51,382

Sure

1337
01:57:58,696 --> 01:58:01,494
你出声，我捅死你！
You make a sound, l'll fucking kill you!

1338
01:58:01,965 --> 01:58:03,728
好
Okay, okay

1339
01:58:18,515 --> 01:58:21,279
贱种！
Fucker! Fuck off!

1340
01:58:32,830 --> 01:58:34,422
别打扰，他想睡觉
He says he wants to sleep

1341
01:58:34,765 --> 01:58:36,756
筋疲力竭
Tired him out, huh?

1342
01:58:54,318 --> 01:58:57,116
药物关系，她仍未清醒
She's still out. lt's the medication

1343
01:58:59,289 --> 01:59:00,517
她平安吗？
ls she okay?

1344
01:59:00,891 --> 01:59:02,552
平安
She's okay

01:59:14,171 --> 01:59:18,164
慕莉
Molly?

1346
01:59:24,681 --> 01:59:28,085
我刚去找过安德鲁…
l just went to Carver...

1347
01:59:28,085 --> 01:59:31,851
把他踢得不似人形
and kicked the shit out of him

1348
01:59:35,726 --> 01:59:37,887
我爱你
l love you

1349
01:59:50,307 --> 01:59:53,208
请问姬丝桃在哪？  319号房
Cristal Connors, please. Room 319

1350
02:00:01,251 --> 02:00:03,947
记得我的金石良言吗？
You know the best advice l ever gave you?

1351
02:00:05,155 --> 02:00:07,453
最后剩下你的话…

到此为止

1355
02:00:20,771 --> 02:00:22,102
对不起，姬丝桃

1356
02:00:22,472 --> 02:00:26,374
我明白你多内疚
Yeah. l know just how sorry you are

1357
02:00:28,245 --> 02:00:31,874
我当上主角，也使同一手段
How do you think l got my first lead?

1358
02:00:34,084 --> 02:00:36,712
总会有人更年轻、更野心…
There's always someone younger and hungrier...

1359
02:00:36,820 --> 02:00:40,051
跟着你下楼梯

1360
02:00:41,358 --> 02:00:43,258
为什么不说我推你？

1361
02:00:43,594 --> 02:00:47,291
亲爱的…我需要歇一歇
Oh, hell, darling...l needed a rest

1362
02:00:47,865 --> 02:00:52,234
况且，我也获得一大笔赔款
Besides, my lawyers got me a real nice settlement

1363
02:00:55,539 --> 02:00:56,733
我要走了
l have to go

1364
02:00:56,807 --> 02:00:59,901
不给我来个热吻？
Aren't you going to give me a big kiss?

1365
02:01:38,382 --> 02:01:40,077
再见，亲爱的

1366
02:01:47,457 --> 02:01:50,017

So did you gamble?

1371
02:02:43,780 --> 02:02:45,270
赢？
Did you win?

1372
02:02:49,019 --> 02:02:50,281
赢了什么？
What did you win?
