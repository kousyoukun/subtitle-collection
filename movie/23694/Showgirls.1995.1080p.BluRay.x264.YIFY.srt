3

Vegas.

4
00:01:22,163 --> 00:01:23,730
Come on.

5
00:01:23,731 --> 00:01:25,699
This is your lucky day.

6
00:01:43,017 --> 00:01:46,553
You can sit a little bit
closer if you want.

7
00:01:47,772 --> 00:01:49,189
It was a bad idea.

8
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:52,592
- Chill, okay?
- I'm chilled.

9
00:01:52,593 --> 00:01:55,612
I sure am glad you're gonna
be such good company.

Me neither.

13
00:02:00,702 --> 00:02:04,488
I don't know anybody
that likes him.

14
00:02:06,324 --> 00:02:10,210
You gonna keep that thing
open all the way to Vegas?

15
00:02:12,113 --> 00:02:14,748
You got a name?

16
00:02:14,749 --> 00:02:18,451
Look, I'll just pull over
and you can get out, okay?

17
00:02:18,452 --> 00:02:21,138
I've been driving all the
way from Kansas. I'm tired.

18
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:24,141
I ain't in the mood to
get myself pig-stuck

19
00:02:24,142 --> 00:02:26,593
for doing somebody
a favor. Okay?

20
00:02:26,594 --> 00:02:28,328
I'll just pull on over.

21
00:02:34,802 --> 00:02:37,104
All right?

22
00:02:41,826 --> 00:02:45,112
So you got a name?

23
00:02:45,113 --> 00:02:46,864
I'm Jeff.

24
00:02:46,865 --> 00:02:49,283
Nomi.

25
00:02:49,284 --> 00:02:51,335
What kind of name's that?

26
00:02:51,336 --> 00:02:53,453
My mom was Italian.

27
00:02:53,454 --> 00:02:55,339
Italian, huh?

28
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,758
You one of those mafia girls?

29
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:59,960
That why you got your blade?

30

for, you gonna win?

31
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:08,218
I'm gonna dance.

32
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:11,504
You gonna be one of them
private escort dancers?

33
00:03:11,505 --> 00:03:15,142
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

- There she is.
- You been here before?

36
00:03:28,189 --> 00:03:32,292
Sure. I got an uncle.
He's a host at the riviera.

37
00:03:33,211 --> 00:03:35,796
- You gamble?
- No.

38
00:03:35,797 --> 00:03:39,383
You got to gamble
if you're gonna win.

39
00:03:39,384 --> 00:03:41,835
I'm gonna win.

40
00:03:41,836 --> 00:03:44,638
You can use some of that mafia
money you got in the suitcase.

41
00:04:06,778 --> 00:04:09,997
Just leave your stuff in the car.
I can talk to my uncle,

42
00:04:09,998 --> 00:04:13,200
See if he can
help you get a job.

43
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:17,087
What, ain't anyone
ever been nice to you?

44
00:04:25,046 --> 00:04:27,047
Want to play a slot machine?

45
00:04:27,048 --> 00:04:29,516
Yeah.

46
00:04:29,517 --> 00:04:32,853
Here's 10 bucks.
You win, we split it up.

47
00:04:32,854 --> 00:04:35,355
No holding out on me either.

48
00:04:35,356 --> 00:04:37,307
I'm gonna go see my uncle.

49
00:04:40,044 --> 00:04:42,179
Meet you right back here.

50
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,979

Look at you.

54
00:05:10,224 --> 00:05:14,194
- Want to try some silver dollars?
- Sure.

55

You want to make some more?

It won't take you any
longer than 15 minutes.

59
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:35,115
Sooner or later, you're

I don't have any family.

We do not have time for

She wants to smile her snatch.

132
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:48,001
She probably cut
that string herself.

- It's that damn monkey act. He feeds them garlic.
- It stinks in here.

Do you want me to go
on stage without a g?

Give me one damn minute. Jesus!

138

- Who wants to see her snatch anyway?
- I certainly wouldn't.

Wouldn't it be great if one of these
nights she fell down the stairs?

- Can I go up there?
- Sure.

165
00:12:50,284 --> 00:12:52,285
We're thrilled
to have you here.

166
00:12:52,286 --> 00:12:54,354
And I'm thrilled to be here.

167
00:12:54,355 --> 00:12:55,955
You, too, now.

168
00:12:55,956 --> 00:12:58,324
Mr. Karlman,
can we have one of you

169
00:12:58,325 --> 00:12:59,993
handing Cristal the flowers?

170
00:12:59,994 --> 00:13:01,461
Zack.

171
00:13:01,462 --> 00:13:04,063
Zack, you do it.

172
00:13:04,064 --> 00:13:05,782
This is Zack Carey,

173
00:13:05,783 --> 00:13:07,784
The entertainment director
of Stardust hotel.

174
00:13:07,785 --> 00:13:09,869
He's so smooth.

175
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:13,740
- Your bouquet, Ms. Connors.
- Can I keep them?

176
00:13:13,741 --> 00:13:16,242
Okay, folks, that's it.
Thank you very much for coming.

177
00:13:16,243 --> 00:13:19,446
Thanks a lot.
That's all.

178
00:13:22,082 --> 00:13:23,783
She's great, isn't she?

179
00:13:23,784 --> 00:13:25,468
She doesn't suck.

180
00:13:25,469 --> 00:13:27,137
Molly, we still need you.

181
00:13:27,138 --> 00:13:28,838
Come with me.

182
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:31,591
You can be my assistant.
Come on.

183
00:13:37,798 --> 00:13:39,599
<i>Yes?</i>

184
00:13:41,202 --> 00:13:43,903
Yes, miss Connors.

185
00:13:43,904 --> 00:13:46,039
Cristal. Please.

186
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,474
And you are?
I'm sorry.

187
00:13:47,475 --> 00:13:49,175
Molly.
Molly Abrams.

188
00:13:49,176 --> 00:13:51,244
Molly, this top is too tight.

189
00:13:51,245 --> 00:13:52,879
My breasts are getting crushed.

190
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,814
I can loosen it for you.

191
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:58,184
Okay, to about here.
No, no, a little less.

192
00:13:58,185 --> 00:14:00,153
I want my nipples to press,

193
00:14:00,154 --> 00:14:01,788
I don't want them

194
00:14:01,789 --> 00:14:03,089
to look like
they're levitating.

195
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,191
- Okay.
- Thanks, darlin'.

196
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:07,327
You're welcome.

197
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,902
You were really
great tonight, miss...

198
00:14:15,903 --> 00:14:20,240
Cristal.
Thanks, darlin'.

199
00:14:20,241 --> 00:14:22,575
Andrew Carver sent you these?

200
00:14:22,576 --> 00:14:24,911
If that's what the card says,

201
00:14:24,912 --> 00:14:26,379
Then that's who sent it.

202
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,947
I just love him.

203
00:14:27,948 --> 00:14:29,849
Oh. This is
my friend Nomi.

204
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,585
- She's a dancer, too.
- Is she now?

205
00:14:32,586 --> 00:14:35,538
Yes, and she's really good.

206
00:14:35,539 --> 00:14:37,857
Where do you dance at?

207
00:14:37,858 --> 00:14:40,176
At the Cheetah.

208
00:14:40,177 --> 00:14:43,046
I don't know how good
you are, darlin',

209
00:14:43,047 --> 00:14:46,149
And I don't know
what it is you're good at,

210
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,101
But if it's at the Cheetah,

211
00:14:48,102 --> 00:14:50,553
It's not dancing,
I know that much.

212
00:14:51,805 --> 00:14:54,090
You don't know shit!

213
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,062
I'm really sorry, miss Connors.

214
00:14:59,063 --> 00:15:00,813
Cristal.

215
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:03,917
I told you.

216
00:15:03,918 --> 00:15:06,252
Cristal.

217
00:15:06,253 --> 00:15:07,937
Your friend has nice nails.

218
00:15:07,938 --> 00:15:10,406
She does them herself.

219
00:15:10,407 --> 00:15:13,526
Maybe she can do mine sometime.

220
00:15:15,896 --> 00:15:18,831
Hey! Hey!

221
00:15:18,832 --> 00:15:20,783
Nomi!

222
00:15:20,784 --> 00:15:23,336
I work here, okay?

223
00:15:23,337 --> 00:15:25,588
I need my paycheck.

224
00:15:25,589 --> 00:15:27,907
I do not want her
to be pissed at me.

225
00:15:27,908 --> 00:15:30,510
I'm sorry!

226
00:15:32,963 --> 00:15:35,882
- I'm sorry.
- Jesus, Nomi.

227
00:15:42,773 --> 00:15:45,191
I'll drive you to work, okay?

228
00:15:45,192 --> 00:15:46,809
I'm not going.

229
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:49,228
They'll fire you.

230
00:15:49,229 --> 00:15:50,863
Fuck, I don't care.

231
00:15:50,864 --> 00:15:53,199
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.

232
00:15:55,869 --> 00:15:59,455
Okay, let's go.

233
00:15:59,456 --> 00:16:01,574
Where?

234
00:16:01,575 --> 00:16:03,943
You know where.

235
00:16:03,944 --> 00:16:07,096
Aaahh!

236
00:16:29,586 --> 00:16:32,055
She can dance, can't she?

237
00:16:32,056 --> 00:16:34,057
She thinks she can.

238
00:16:36,443 --> 00:16:38,995
I'm gonna go dance with her.

239
00:16:38,996 --> 00:16:42,048
Man, you can't do that.
You're working.

240
00:16:42,049 --> 00:16:44,367
T.C.'s gonna
have your ass.

241
00:16:44,368 --> 00:16:47,820
T.C.'s at the riviera
playing craps.

242
00:16:47,821 --> 00:16:51,040
- You want to dance?
- I am dancing.

243
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,959
But do you want to dance with me?

244
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,396
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

245
00:16:56,397 --> 00:16:58,514
I'm gonna have a drink.

246
00:17:19,937 --> 00:17:21,637
You can dance.

247
00:17:21,638 --> 00:17:24,107
I don't lie.
You can't.

248
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:27,076
Then what am I doing?

249
00:17:28,879 --> 00:17:30,630
Teasing my dick.

250
00:17:30,631 --> 00:17:32,949
You got potential.
I could teach you.

251
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,384
Yeah?

252
00:17:34,385 --> 00:17:36,836
Yeah.

253
00:17:38,172 --> 00:17:40,656
Ooh!

254
00:17:40,657 --> 00:17:44,427
- I'm not teasing it now, am I?
- Watch it, buddy.

255
00:17:44,428 --> 00:17:48,514
- Be cool. I'm a bouncer.
- You be cool, buddy.

256
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:03,329
Nomi!

257
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,782
- Hey, you!
- Hey!

258
00:18:05,783 --> 00:18:07,934
Hold her!
She started it.

259
00:18:07,935 --> 00:18:11,237
- Fuck you! Fuck you, asshole!
- Party's over.

260
00:18:13,273 --> 00:18:16,092
- Malone.
- Yeah.

261
00:18:16,093 --> 00:18:19,429
You're out of here.

262
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,080
Hey, your release papers.

263
00:18:21,081 --> 00:18:22,448
Yo, what's up?

264
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:24,050
I bailed you out, girl.

265
00:18:24,051 --> 00:18:26,418
Don't that even
give me a cup of coffee?

266
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:29,772
All I did was tell you
I'd teach you to dance.

267
00:18:29,773 --> 00:18:32,758
I don't need nobody
to teach me to dance.

268
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:34,811
That's because
you're a bad-ass.

269
00:18:34,812 --> 00:18:36,813
You got your arm straight out,

270
00:18:36,814 --> 00:18:38,147
Saying, "back off,
motherfucker."

271
00:18:38,148 --> 00:18:40,450
Back off, motherfucker!

272
00:18:42,753 --> 00:18:45,521
Whoo!
You know what?

273
00:18:45,522 --> 00:18:47,540
My head hurts, my dick hurts,

274
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:50,159
And you got me fired
from my fucking job.

275
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,211
Shit happens, you know?

276
00:18:52,212 --> 00:18:55,281
That's it?
That's what I get, fucking wisdom?

277
00:18:55,282 --> 00:18:57,216
- That's it?
- Yeah, that's it.

278
00:18:57,217 --> 00:18:59,585
You get wisdom.

279
00:18:59,586 --> 00:19:01,954
You're not just
a pa in my dick.

280
00:19:01,955 --> 00:19:04,140
You're also a pain in my ass.

281
00:19:04,141 --> 00:19:05,725
You're not just
life sucks, you know? Y dick.

282
00:19:05,726 --> 00:19:07,126
"Life sucks"?
"shit happens"?

283
00:19:07,127 --> 00:19:09,345
You get this stuff
off of t-shirts?

284
00:19:10,797 --> 00:19:13,983
All I want is a cup of coffee.

285
00:19:13,984 --> 00:19:16,636
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

286
00:19:17,971 --> 00:19:19,572
You got a quarter?

287
00:19:19,573 --> 00:19:21,741
Sure. Here.

288
00:19:21,742 --> 00:19:23,609
Buy yourself a cup.

289
00:19:25,078 --> 00:19:27,146
Al is pissed.

290
00:19:27,147 --> 00:19:29,949
He says if you
miss another night...

291
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,534
How did you get out?

292
00:19:31,535 --> 00:19:33,336
Him.
He bailed me out.

293
00:19:33,337 --> 00:19:36,589
- How come?
- I kicked him in the nuts.

294
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,823
He liked it?

295
00:19:37,824 --> 00:19:40,827
- He must've.
- Nomi.

296
00:19:44,665 --> 00:19:47,967
Nomi, do my boobs
look any bigger to you?

297
00:19:47,968 --> 00:19:50,870
Shit. Carmi thinks
she's pregnant again.

298
00:19:50,871 --> 00:19:52,772
Girl, you missed
your period again?

299
00:19:52,773 --> 00:19:56,776
I don't know.
I don't think so.

300
00:19:56,777 --> 00:19:59,478
It's like a Japanese
convention out there.

301
00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:00,980
Hey, mama!

302
00:20:00,981 --> 00:20:02,315
Maybe you better get

303
00:20:02,316 --> 00:20:04,917
your little weenie jokes
cranked up there.

304
00:20:04,918 --> 00:20:06,586
This thing isn't working again.

305
00:20:06,587 --> 00:20:08,187
Come on, baby.

306
00:20:08,188 --> 00:20:10,356
Come on, here we go.

307
00:20:10,357 --> 00:20:12,358
One more time.
Harder. Harder.

308
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:14,293
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

309
00:20:14,294 --> 00:20:17,163
Let me try it.

310
00:20:17,164 --> 00:20:20,199
Ladies, hey!

311
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,036
Hey, I want you to meet hope.

312
00:20:24,037 --> 00:20:25,938
- Hi.
- Okay, cut it out.

313
00:20:25,939 --> 00:20:28,708
Hope, this is Tiffany,

314
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:31,077
Farrah, Heather, Henrietta.

315
00:20:31,078 --> 00:20:34,814
My name isn't Hope.
My name's Penny.

316
00:20:34,815 --> 00:20:36,415
Ha ha ha...

317
00:20:37,918 --> 00:20:39,252
They want class,
dumb-dumb.

318
00:20:39,253 --> 00:20:41,254
They don't want to fuck a Penny.

319
00:20:41,255 --> 00:20:43,289
They want to fuck a Heather

320
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,891
or a Tiffany.

321
00:20:44,892 --> 00:20:47,994
Or hope, huh?

322
00:20:47,995 --> 00:20:49,996
This is a class joint.

323
00:20:49,997 --> 00:20:51,080
You got that?

324
00:20:51,081 --> 00:20:54,083
Gentlemen and those
few ladies out there,

325
00:20:54,084 --> 00:20:56,752
What you've all
been waiting for...

326
00:20:56,753 --> 00:21:00,890
Henrietta...
Queen of bazooms!

327
00:21:13,403 --> 00:21:17,440
Hey, Henrietta! Hey, hey, hey!
Pull your dress up.

328
00:21:17,441 --> 00:21:18,941
You could never handle me

329
00:21:18,942 --> 00:21:20,910
with all these wrinkles of fat.

330
00:21:20,911 --> 00:21:25,064
Why, you'd never
even find the thing.

331
00:21:27,734 --> 00:21:30,703
I'd have to piss on you
to give you a clue.

332
00:21:33,357 --> 00:21:35,725
You need more pink.

333
00:21:35,726 --> 00:21:38,761
Thanks, Heather.

334
00:21:38,762 --> 00:21:41,163
Have you ever done
a lap dance before?

335
00:21:41,164 --> 00:21:42,999
No.

336
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,334
Got to talk them into it, okay?

337
00:21:45,335 --> 00:21:48,337
50 bucks a pop, you
take them in the back.

338
00:21:48,338 --> 00:21:50,589
Touch and go.
They touch, they go.

339
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:53,859
You can touch them.
They cannot touch you.

340
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,528
Oh, that's good.

341
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:57,930
If they come, it's okay.

342
00:21:57,931 --> 00:22:01,534
If they take it out, come all
over you, call the bouncer.

343
00:22:01,535 --> 00:22:05,271
If he gives you
a big tip, it's okay.

344
00:22:05,272 --> 00:22:07,440
You got that?

345
00:22:07,441 --> 00:22:10,109
Okay.

346
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:12,228
Good.

347
00:22:12,229 --> 00:22:17,233
And you... Where the fuck
were you last night?

348
00:22:17,234 --> 00:22:19,635
I was having my period, al.

349
00:22:19,636 --> 00:22:23,556
You don't want blood
all over the place.

350
00:22:23,557 --> 00:22:25,191
Do you?

351
00:22:25,192 --> 00:22:28,844
I'm getting real tired
of your shit, kid.

352
00:22:28,845 --> 00:22:31,847
If you want to last
longer than a week,

353
00:22:31,848 --> 00:22:34,383
You'll give me a blow job.

354
00:22:34,384 --> 00:22:37,053
First I get you
used to the money,

355
00:22:37,054 --> 00:22:39,188
Then I make you swallow.

356
00:22:41,742 --> 00:22:43,976
Was he serious?

357
00:22:50,033 --> 00:22:52,852

00:22:56,073 --> 00:22:57,856

He says in America,
everyone's a gynecologist.

385
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:26,355
You like her?

386
00:25:26,356 --> 00:25:28,340
I like you.

387
00:25:28,341 --> 00:25:30,910
I'll buy her for you.

388
00:25:43,223 --> 00:25:45,224
What the hell are you doing?

389
00:25:45,225 --> 00:25:47,226
We got spenders out there.

390
00:25:47,227 --> 00:25:48,861
Put your nightie on.

391
00:25:48,862 --> 00:25:50,896
Tell him to go fuck himself.

392
00:25:50,897 --> 00:25:52,531
Ha.

393
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,302
I'll kick your ass out of here.

394
00:25:56,303 --> 00:25:59,338
Tell him.
Do yourself a favor.

395
00:25:59,339 --> 00:26:01,407
Okay,

396
00:26:01,408 --> 00:26:04,210
I'll put my nightie on.

397
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:33,672
Hi. My name's
Heather.

398
00:26:50,923 --> 00:26:53,925
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- Want a drink?

399
00:26:53,926 --> 00:26:55,978
Hi, I'm Heather.

400
00:26:55,979 --> 00:26:57,947
Would you like a
private dance with me?

401
00:26:57,948 --> 00:27:00,482
Could I suck your tits?

402
00:27:00,483 --> 00:27:03,619
You can't touch me,
but I can touch you.

403
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,371
I'd love to touch you.

404
00:27:05,372 --> 00:27:08,040
I know where you can touch me.

405
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:10,159
Heather.

406
00:27:16,949 --> 00:27:19,802
What's going on?

407
00:27:19,803 --> 00:27:22,087
They want a private
dance with her.

408
00:27:24,391 --> 00:27:28,177
So? Great,
get over there.

409
00:27:28,178 --> 00:27:30,095
Hi. My name is Heather.

410
00:27:30,096 --> 00:27:33,649
Hey, Nomi.
I love your nails.

411
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:36,151
We'd like you to private
dance with both of us.

412
00:27:36,152 --> 00:27:40,022
We don't do that.
One at a time, no women.

413
00:27:40,023 --> 00:27:42,024
$100.

414
00:27:42,025 --> 00:27:45,811
Sorry.
That's the rules.

415
00:27:45,812 --> 00:27:50,115
200. You just do Zack,
and I'll watch.

416
00:27:52,335 --> 00:27:55,421
$500.

417
00:27:55,422 --> 00:27:57,673
Done.

418
00:28:00,844 --> 00:28:02,928
I said done.

419
00:28:28,855 --> 00:28:30,823
You guys just sit over there,

420
00:28:30,824 --> 00:28:32,958
And I'll change the music.

421
00:28:34,227 --> 00:28:35,861
What's this about, cris?

422
00:28:35,862 --> 00:28:37,246
It's about fun.

423
00:28:37,247 --> 00:28:38,881
Ha ha. Uh-huh.

424
00:28:38,882 --> 00:28:40,866
You sit there,

425
00:28:40,867 --> 00:28:43,385
And I'll sit here.

You're such a bitch.

448
00:32:09,459 --> 00:32:11,627
Oh, but you love me.

449
00:32:11,628 --> 00:32:14,630
- Can you walk?
- Yeah.

450
00:32:15,965 --> 00:32:17,532
Good night, girls.

451
00:32:17,533 --> 00:32:20,102
- Good night, al.
- Get some rest.

452
00:32:24,607 --> 00:32:25,941
Go out and celebrate.

453
00:32:25,942 --> 00:32:28,910
We can go to my place
and smoke some dope.

454
00:32:28,911 --> 00:32:31,613
You still got some
of the thai stuff?

455
00:32:31,614 --> 00:32:34,650
I love thighs. I almost
get off on thighs.

456
00:32:34,651 --> 00:32:35,917
I like armpits, too.

457
00:32:35,918 --> 00:32:38,387
- You want to come, Nomi?
- Not me.

458
00:32:38,388 --> 00:32:43,025
- I'll come.
- Hey, you just got 500 off a lap dance.

459
00:32:43,026 --> 00:32:44,993
Al, just stop.

460
00:32:44,994 --> 00:32:47,412
You act like somebody died.

461
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,644
Hey.

462
00:33:05,014 --> 00:33:06,815
Wait a minute.
Listen.

463
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:09,101
Just listen.

464
00:33:09,102 --> 00:33:11,987
You got more natural
talent when you dance

465
00:33:11,988 --> 00:33:15,023
than anybody I've ever seen.

466
00:33:15,024 --> 00:33:17,909
I've seen a lot of dancers.

467
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:20,912
I studied in new york...
Alvin ailey.

468
00:33:20,913 --> 00:33:23,865
You burn when you dance.

469
00:33:23,866 --> 00:33:25,684
Yeah, you said I couldn't.

470
00:33:25,685 --> 00:33:27,986
You got to hold some of it in.

471
00:33:27,987 --> 00:33:30,989
You got some shit to learn.
Dancing ain't fucking.

472
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:33,491
What's that, more wisdom?
I know that.

473
00:33:33,492 --> 00:33:35,043
No, you don't.

474
00:33:35,044 --> 00:33:37,629
You dance like when you
fucked that guy last night.

475
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:40,182
- What guy?
- That guy with the chick.

476
00:33:40,183 --> 00:33:42,968
You took them in the back.

477
00:33:42,969 --> 00:33:45,687
- I didn't fuck him.
- You fucked him and her.

478
00:33:45,688 --> 00:33:47,222
Are you following me?

479
00:33:47,223 --> 00:33:50,692
- I didn't fuck anybody.
- I saw you!

480
00:33:50,693 --> 00:33:52,694
Man, everybody
got aids and shit.

481
00:33:52,695 --> 00:33:55,480
What is it that
you think you do?

482
00:33:55,481 --> 00:33:58,183
You fuck them without fucking them.
That's what you do.

483
00:33:58,184 --> 00:33:59,985
Well, it ain't right.

484
00:33:59,986 --> 00:34:02,371
You got too much talent
for it to be right.

485
00:34:02,372 --> 00:34:03,989
Get out of here!

486
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:07,159
Bitch, I'm telling you
the truth.

487
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,395
You want me to go,
I'm out of here.

488
00:34:15,368 --> 00:34:17,202
- Boo!
- Uhh!

489
00:34:17,203 --> 00:34:20,038
- I got an "a."
- yay!

490
00:34:22,141 --> 00:34:25,560
Four more classes and they're gonna
have to give me that degree.

491
00:34:25,561 --> 00:34:27,512
Great.

492
00:34:27,513 --> 00:34:29,681
I haven't gotten laid
in six months.

493
00:34:29,682 --> 00:34:33,251
My right hand's so tight,
I can barely thread a needle.

494
00:34:33,252 --> 00:34:34,753
Use the left one.

495
00:34:34,754 --> 00:34:37,422
- For threading a needle?
- Yeah.

496
00:34:42,762 --> 00:34:45,864
Oh!
I like that.

497
00:34:45,865 --> 00:34:47,866
I can make that.

498
00:34:47,867 --> 00:34:49,468
Yeah?

499
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:51,970
Yeah, let's go
to the fabric store.

500
00:34:53,973 --> 00:34:57,342
I want to buy it.
I've got the money.

501
00:34:57,343 --> 00:34:58,810
Why?

502
00:34:58,811 --> 00:35:01,713
I don't know.
I just do.

503
00:35:04,851 --> 00:35:07,352
I never had a dress like that.

504
00:35:08,821 --> 00:35:11,256
It'll look great on me.

505
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,228
Won't it?

506
00:35:16,229 --> 00:35:17,963
Yeah.

507
00:35:21,267 --> 00:35:23,301
Ooh, what do you think?

508
00:35:23,302 --> 00:35:25,904
Oh, my goodness.

509
00:35:25,905 --> 00:35:27,272
Wow.

510
00:35:27,273 --> 00:35:29,841
It looks quite good on you.

511
00:35:29,842 --> 00:35:31,910
It doesn't suck.

512
00:35:31,911 --> 00:35:34,412
Ha ha ha ha.

513
00:35:34,413 --> 00:35:36,381
I can't believe I bought it.

514
00:35:36,382 --> 00:35:39,017
We'll celebrate.
I'll buy you a burrito.

515
00:35:39,018 --> 00:35:41,486
I'll even buy you some fajitas.

516
00:35:41,487 --> 00:35:44,289
Oh, fajitas.

517
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:46,458
Fuck, I can't.
I'm on early.

518
00:35:46,459 --> 00:35:48,593
Al's on my back.

519
00:35:48,594 --> 00:35:51,813
- Don't worry. I'll drive you.
- Okay.

520
00:35:51,814 --> 00:35:55,083
Oh, my god!
Aah!

521
00:35:55,084 --> 00:35:57,135
He's coming here!

522
00:35:57,136 --> 00:35:59,104
Maybe you can meet him.

523
00:35:59,105 --> 00:36:01,072
I wouldn't know what to say.

524
00:36:01,073 --> 00:36:04,075
Say, "Andrew, I can't even
thread a needle anymore."

525
00:36:04,076 --> 00:36:06,311
Baby, mama's waiting for you.
Come to me.

526
00:36:06,312 --> 00:36:09,981
- Stop!
- I gotta get tickets to the concert.

527
00:36:46,168 --> 00:36:49,120
- Hey, baby, give it to me.
- Hey, come on.

528
00:36:49,121 --> 00:36:50,388
Come on, baby.

529
00:36:50,389 --> 00:36:52,741
- Hey...
- fuck off!

530
00:36:52,742 --> 00:36:55,677
Whoa, sorry.
Remember me?

531
00:36:55,678 --> 00:36:58,597
Phil Newkirk, Stardust Hotel.

532
00:36:58,598 --> 00:37:01,933
Listen, there's a spot
open in the chorus line.

533
00:37:01,934 --> 00:37:03,535
We're auditioning
tomorrow morning.

534
00:37:03,536 --> 00:37:05,887
I think you should try out.

535
00:37:05,888 --> 00:37:08,757
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

536
00:37:08,758 --> 00:37:10,875
You came here to ask me?

537
00:37:10,876 --> 00:37:14,813
When I saw you dance,
I thought, "yes."

538
00:37:16,432 --> 00:37:18,650
She sent you, didn't she?

539
00:37:18,651 --> 00:37:21,019
No, nobody sent me.

540
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,854
Be there at 10:00.

541
00:37:24,891 --> 00:37:26,625

542

<i>The queen of bazooms...

543
00:37:30,896 --> 00:37:33,698

00:37:49,932 --> 00:37:51,549
Molly!

550
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:52,851
Molly!

551
00:37:52,852 --> 00:37:56,438
What?
What is it?

552
00:37:56,439 --> 00:38:00,725
I got an audition.
Ha ha. Aah!

553
00:38:10,236 --> 00:38:12,203
Hey, pollyanna.

554
00:38:12,204 --> 00:38:15,156
- What'd you call me?
- I said you look like pollyanna.

555
00:38:15,157 --> 00:38:18,977
Okay, ladies, I'm Tony Moss.

556
00:38:18,978 --> 00:38:21,513
I produce this show.

557
00:38:21,514 --> 00:38:24,549
Some of you probably
heard that I'm a prick.

558
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,451
I am a prick.

559
00:38:26,452 --> 00:38:29,888
<i>I got one interest here
and that's the show.</i>

560
00:38:29,889 --> 00:38:32,273
I don't care whether
you live or die.

561
00:38:32,274 --> 00:38:35,176
I want to see you
dance and smile.

562
00:38:35,177 --> 00:38:37,178
I can't use you
if you can't smile,

563
00:38:37,179 --> 00:38:39,397
I can't use you
if you can't show.

564
00:38:39,398 --> 00:38:42,701
<i>I can't use you if you can't sell.
Let me look at you.</i>

565
00:38:42,702 --> 00:38:44,135
Spread out.

566
00:38:45,371 --> 00:38:48,406
<i>Spread out.
Jesus Christ!</i>

567
00:38:48,407 --> 00:38:50,442
Marty, look at these tits.

568
00:38:50,443 --> 00:38:52,077
What are these, watermelons?

569
00:38:52,078 --> 00:38:54,512
This is a stage, not a patch.

570
00:38:54,513 --> 00:38:57,148
See ya.

571
00:38:57,149 --> 00:38:58,717
I've seen you before.

572
00:38:58,718 --> 00:39:01,753
Yes, Mr. Moss, I auditioned
for you in January.

573
00:39:01,754 --> 00:39:04,155
You told me to
get my nose fixed.

574
00:39:04,156 --> 00:39:06,791
- Nose looks good.
- Thank you.

575
00:39:06,792 --> 00:39:09,177
- Nice smile, too.
- Thank you.

576
00:39:09,178 --> 00:39:11,829
But your ears are sticking out.
They are.

577
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:15,934
Come see me when you get 'em fixed.
See ya.

578
00:39:15,935 --> 00:39:18,520
Can you spell "mgm" backwards?
I bet you can't.

579
00:39:18,521 --> 00:39:20,972
- M-g-m.
- I'm impressed.

580
00:39:20,973 --> 00:39:23,841
Come back when you've
fucked off this baby fat.

581
00:39:23,842 --> 00:39:28,346
- I hope you got some nice wigs, tennis ball.
- I do.

582
00:39:28,347 --> 00:39:30,315
What kind of classes
have you had?

583
00:39:30,316 --> 00:39:33,351
Ice skating classes, ballet
classes, technique classes,

584
00:39:33,352 --> 00:39:35,904
Stretch classes, jazz classes,
jazz technique classes.

585
00:39:35,905 --> 00:39:39,324
This show is called <i>Goddess,</i>
it ain't called <i>classes.</i>

586
00:39:39,325 --> 00:39:42,761
See ya. What kind of
classes have you had?

587
00:39:42,762 --> 00:39:44,863
I haven't had classes.

588
00:39:44,864 --> 00:39:46,498
What are you doing here?

589
00:39:46,499 --> 00:39:49,167
I'm watching you be a prick.

590
00:39:49,168 --> 00:39:52,203
Well, you ain't
seen nothing yet.

591
00:39:52,204 --> 00:39:54,739
Gay, run them
through the routine.

592
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:57,175
All right, everyone
back up, find some space.

593
00:39:57,176 --> 00:39:59,144
Start with your right leg,

594
00:39:59,145 --> 00:40:02,897
Slap it on
1, 2, 3, and 4.

595
00:40:02,898 --> 00:40:04,566
Go!

596
00:40:04,567 --> 00:40:07,318
Go, 5, 6, 7.
Hit it!

597
00:40:07,319 --> 00:40:10,505
Bum-bah!
Ho! Ho!

598
00:40:10,506 --> 00:40:12,741
<i>Slam it!
Bum-bah!</i>

599
00:40:13,743 --> 00:40:17,011
Ho! Kick!

600
00:40:17,012 --> 00:40:18,913
Ha! Ha!

601
00:40:18,914 --> 00:40:21,066
<i>Go! Go! Go!</i>

602
00:40:21,067 --> 00:40:22,917
<i>And...
Stay there!</i>

603
00:40:22,918 --> 00:40:25,954
Relax. Take a break.

604
00:40:25,955 --> 00:40:28,623
Okay, tennis ball, dark
hair in the back...

605
00:40:28,624 --> 00:40:30,291
Hello, doll.

606
00:40:30,292 --> 00:40:33,928
- So how's it going?
- Pretty good.

607
00:40:33,929 --> 00:40:36,514
Okay.

608
00:40:36,515 --> 00:40:38,600
I want you to stay.

609
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:41,953
And... You.

610
00:40:43,773 --> 00:40:47,759
And you, too. Goodbye, ladies,
you wasted my time and yours.

611
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,029
<i>The other three,
line 'em up.</i>

612
00:40:53,966 --> 00:40:56,401
Okay, show me your tits.

613
00:40:57,703 --> 00:41:01,773
I got a topless show.
Let me see your tits.

614
00:41:17,156 --> 00:41:19,057
Very nice.

615
00:41:20,493 --> 00:41:23,294
Very nice, ladies.

616
00:41:23,295 --> 00:41:26,397
Gay, go to the other music.
Marty, change the lights.

617
00:41:26,398 --> 00:41:28,983
<i>Cue angel. Let's
come in at 20 seconds.</i>

618
00:41:28,984 --> 00:41:30,968
<i>Jack, bring up
the side spots.</i>

619
00:41:30,969 --> 00:41:32,403
<i>All right!</i>

620
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:38,176
I want to see some attitude!

621
00:41:38,177 --> 00:41:40,728
I said attitude!

622
00:41:40,729 --> 00:41:45,867
Come on, ladies!
Sell! Sell your bodies!

623
00:41:48,354 --> 00:41:50,121
Cut it!

624
00:41:50,122 --> 00:41:53,391
Try yoga, babe, or hanging
from the ceiling.

625
00:41:53,392 --> 00:41:56,995
See ya.
Marty, ice.

626
00:41:56,996 --> 00:41:59,764
- You got something wrong with your nipples?
- No.

627
00:41:59,765 --> 00:42:02,567
- They're not sticking up. Stick them up.
- What?

628
00:42:02,568 --> 00:42:04,869
Play with them a little bit.

629
00:42:09,542 --> 00:42:11,142
Pinch them a little.

630
00:42:11,143 --> 00:42:13,511
You want me to, I'll do it.

631
00:42:26,108 --> 00:42:27,508
I'm erect.

632
00:42:27,509 --> 00:42:30,245
Why aren't you erect?

633
00:42:32,781 --> 00:42:35,917
Here, put some ice on them.

634
00:42:44,143 --> 00:42:46,144
I called that one right.

635
00:42:46,145 --> 00:42:48,212
See ya, pollyanna.

636
00:42:48,213 --> 00:42:51,549
<i>That's it for today.
Thank you.</i>

637
00:43:01,744 --> 00:43:04,829
You got me the audition, didn't you?

638
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:06,864
Mm-hmm.

639
00:43:06,865 --> 00:43:08,866
Why?

640
00:43:10,753 --> 00:43:13,838
Maybe I like the way you dance.

641
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:15,773
Maybe I like you.

642
00:43:15,774 --> 00:43:18,610
What difference does it make?

643
00:43:19,845 --> 00:43:22,931
Did you enjoy that out there?

644
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,268
Yeah, darling, I think I did.

645
00:43:27,269 --> 00:43:30,672
I hate you.

646
00:43:30,673 --> 00:43:32,807
I know.

647
00:43:40,899 --> 00:43:43,901
Here...

648
00:43:43,902 --> 00:43:45,970
Wipe your nose.

649
00:43:56,215 --> 00:43:58,082
The orthodontist convention
is over there.

650
00:43:58,083 --> 00:44:00,852
The realtors are coming in in 20 minutes.
Let's line 'em up!

651
00:44:08,227 --> 00:44:12,063
- Hey!
- Hey.

652
00:44:12,064 --> 00:44:14,065
What are you doing here?

653
00:44:14,066 --> 00:44:16,133
I just did an audition.

654
00:44:16,134 --> 00:44:17,635
You want to be a showgirl?

655
00:44:17,636 --> 00:44:21,022
Smith, what are you doing?
Move those bags.

656
00:44:21,023 --> 00:44:25,026
Didn't go too good, huh?

657
00:44:25,027 --> 00:44:28,863
- Well, I'm glad about that.
- I'm not in the mood!

658
00:44:28,864 --> 00:44:32,650
Hey, Smith! Smith,
I'm talking to you.

659
00:44:32,651 --> 00:44:36,120
You don't want to be
in this kind of show.

660
00:44:36,121 --> 00:44:38,673
What you're doing,
at least it's honest.

661
00:44:38,674 --> 00:44:41,542
They want tits and ass, you
give them tits and ass.

662
00:44:41,543 --> 00:44:43,928
Here, they pretend
they want something else,

663
00:44:43,929 --> 00:44:46,464
And you still show them
tits and ass.

664
00:44:46,465 --> 00:44:50,435
Work her on your own time.
Go line up those bags.

665
00:44:50,436 --> 00:44:53,888
- I'm talking to her.
- You're what?

666
00:44:53,889 --> 00:44:57,358
I'm talking to her. I'm not working her.
I'm talking to her.

667
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,861
And you're interrupting
my conversation,

668
00:44:59,862 --> 00:45:02,864
And that's rude.
Now get the fuck out of here!

669
00:45:02,865 --> 00:45:05,700
- Asshole.
- You're fired!

670
00:45:05,701 --> 00:45:07,702
Yeah?
Take this jacket.

671
00:45:07,703 --> 00:45:10,888
Come on.
Look what you done.

672
00:45:10,889 --> 00:45:12,824
You got me fired again.

673
00:45:12,825 --> 00:45:16,861
You're a real bad-ass.
Ain't you got no shame?

674
00:45:16,862 --> 00:45:19,747
You know what?
Look what a beautiful day it is.

675
00:45:19,748 --> 00:45:21,916
The sun's shining, neon's
blazing, money's flowing.

676
00:45:21,917 --> 00:45:25,870
I'm gonna cheer you up.
I'm gonna get you the best meal in town.

677
00:45:25,871 --> 00:45:28,039
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

678
00:45:30,109 --> 00:45:32,093
You like that burger.

679
00:45:32,094 --> 00:45:33,478
Uh-huh.

680
00:45:33,479 --> 00:45:35,480
Where are you from?

681
00:45:35,481 --> 00:45:39,067
Different places.

682
00:45:39,068 --> 00:45:42,236
You like talking
about you, huh?

683
00:45:53,098 --> 00:45:55,500
Where are we?

684
00:45:55,501 --> 00:45:57,869
- My place.
- Why?

685
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:01,339
I want to show you something.

686
00:46:06,462 --> 00:46:08,963
The best suite in town.

687
00:46:08,964 --> 00:46:12,100
I had to beg
and plead to get it.

688
00:46:17,189 --> 00:46:19,757
This what you
wanted to show me?

689
00:46:19,758 --> 00:46:22,543
What, this nice big bed here?

690
00:46:22,544 --> 00:46:24,946
<i>Hmm?</i>

691
00:46:24,947 --> 00:46:27,031
I wrote this number.

692
00:46:27,032 --> 00:46:29,433
It's about you.

693
00:46:29,434 --> 00:46:31,619
You don't know
anything about me.

694
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:33,905
I know you're a private dancer.

695
00:46:35,273 --> 00:46:37,875
I only need three other girls.

696
00:46:37,876 --> 00:46:41,278
We can put it on
at the crave club.

697
00:46:41,279 --> 00:46:43,714
I'll show you.

698
00:46:43,715 --> 00:46:46,717
Stand right here.
Watch me.

699
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:55,309
Wait a minute.
Slow down! Like this?

700
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:57,578
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

701
00:46:59,665 --> 00:47:01,649
Ssss... Bang!

702
00:47:09,174 --> 00:47:12,176
Come on now, follow me.
I know you can.

703
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:34,191
Mmm! I got my period.

704
00:48:34,192 --> 00:48:36,193
Yeah, right.

705
00:48:36,194 --> 00:48:37,828
Check.

706
00:48:41,984 --> 00:48:45,086
- Oh.
- See?

707
00:48:49,708 --> 00:48:52,126
It's all right.
I got towels.

708
00:48:55,297 --> 00:48:58,432
You can fuck me
when you love me.

709
00:49:03,355 --> 00:49:06,707
- But I do love you.
- Yeah, right.

710
00:49:06,708 --> 00:49:09,727
You don't fool me.
I see you.

711
00:49:09,728 --> 00:49:11,896
What do you see?

712
00:49:11,897 --> 00:49:14,282
- I see you hiding.
- From what?

713
00:49:14,283 --> 00:49:16,334
From you.

714
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,042
You got into some bad shit
someplace, didn't you?

715
00:49:25,043 --> 00:49:27,995
Thanks for the hamburger. Hey!

716
00:49:31,833 --> 00:49:35,686
Where were you? What happened?
Tony Moss called.

717
00:49:35,687 --> 00:49:40,358
He said to call him right away.
Here's the number. Call him.

718
00:49:40,359 --> 00:49:42,476
Oh, Jesus.
I'll call him.

719
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:47,565
Tony Moss, please.

720
00:49:47,566 --> 00:49:49,734
It's Nomi Malone.

721
00:49:51,903 --> 00:49:54,171
Yes?

722
00:49:54,172 --> 00:49:55,806
Yes.

723
00:49:57,109 --> 00:49:59,243
Okay.

724
00:50:02,247 --> 00:50:04,265
I got it.

725
00:50:04,266 --> 00:50:07,652
<i>♪ She's the yellow rose of Texas ♪</i>

726
00:50:07,653 --> 00:50:09,337
♪ she charges 50 bucks ♪

727

729
00:50:13,091 --> 00:50:15,826
- You're late.
- I'm gone.

730
00:50:15,827 --> 00:50:18,896
- I got another job.
- Where you going?

731
00:50:18,897 --> 00:50:21,032
You going to another club?

732
00:50:21,033 --> 00:50:24,869
They giving you a better cut?
I'll match it.

733
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:28,439
I'm in "Goddess"
at the Stardust.

734
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,859
Oh.
Ha ha ha ha!

735
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:33,894
What's so fucking funny?

736
00:50:33,895 --> 00:50:36,030
She's going down
to the Stardust.

737
00:50:36,031 --> 00:50:38,949
She's gonna be in the show.

738
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:40,251
Good for her.

739
00:50:40,252 --> 00:50:43,070
La de dah de dah de dah.

740
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:44,672
She'll be back.

741
00:50:44,673 --> 00:50:47,808
No, I won't.
I'll never come back.

742
00:50:47,809 --> 00:50:50,895
You're a fucking stripper.
Don't you get it?

743
00:50:50,896 --> 00:50:55,199
- I'm a dancer.
- If you're a dancer, then Henry's the virgin Mary.

744
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,902
I got bigger tits than
the fucking virgin Mary.

745
00:50:57,903 --> 00:51:01,455
- And I got a bigger mouth, too.
- Bye.

746
00:51:01,456 --> 00:51:03,474
God damn it.

747
00:51:03,475 --> 00:51:07,061
You're the only one who could
get my tits popping right.

748
00:51:07,062 --> 00:51:08,679
See ya, al.

749
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:12,049
I'm not hiring you
back. You hear me?

750
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:15,186
Not even if you give me
a fucking blow job.

751
00:51:23,328 --> 00:51:25,296
James!

752
00:51:25,297 --> 00:51:29,166
James! Come on!

753
00:51:29,167 --> 00:51:30,735
I got it!

754
00:51:30,736 --> 00:51:33,087
- Got what?
- I'm in the show...

755
00:51:33,088 --> 00:51:35,372
In "Goddess."

756
00:51:35,373 --> 00:51:39,927
Oh, man. What about the
number I wrote for you?

757
00:51:39,928 --> 00:51:44,048
I thought we were
working on something.

758
00:51:44,049 --> 00:51:46,050
<i>James.</i>

759
00:51:56,144 --> 00:51:58,529
She gonna be in your number?

760
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:00,314
I'll be right there.

761
00:52:00,315 --> 00:52:03,100
She can't dance.

762
00:52:03,101 --> 00:52:05,569
Yeah, but you're going
to teach her, right?

763
00:52:07,622 --> 00:52:11,492
She's got talent. Right?

764
00:52:11,493 --> 00:52:15,629
You know, you and me,
we ain't got no ties.

765
00:52:18,884 --> 00:52:22,219
Dancing and fucking, right?

766
00:52:25,807 --> 00:52:28,976
Yeah, that's right.

767
00:52:30,145 --> 00:52:32,930
See ya.

768
00:52:42,007 --> 00:52:44,909
Who was that?

769
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:46,710
Uh...

770
00:52:46,711 --> 00:52:49,647
Just somebody that wanted
to be in the number.

771
00:52:49,648 --> 00:52:52,649
You're not going to give
her my part, are you?

772
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:56,787
- No, baby. She can't dance.
- No?

773
00:52:56,788 --> 00:53:00,891
I wrote that number for you.
You know that. Yeah.

774
00:53:00,892 --> 00:53:03,260
Ow!

775
00:53:08,049 --> 00:53:10,251
Excuse me.

776
00:53:10,252 --> 00:53:12,086
What can I do for you?

777
00:53:12,087 --> 00:53:16,056
I'm supposed to see Mr.
Moss. I'm Nomi Malone.

778
00:53:16,057 --> 00:53:18,158
Okay, go on in.

779
00:53:24,132 --> 00:53:26,500
One day she looks
like pollyanna,

780
00:53:26,501 --> 00:53:29,169
The next day she looks like...

781
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:31,238
I don't know, Lolita maybe.

782
00:53:31,239 --> 00:53:32,990
Nice dress.

783
00:53:32,991 --> 00:53:36,093
Thanks. I bought it at <i>Versayce.</i>

784
00:53:40,482 --> 00:53:42,516
In the forum.

785
00:53:42,517 --> 00:53:44,335
Oh, yeah. Versayce.

786
00:53:44,336 --> 00:53:47,004
- I love Versayce.
- Me, too.

787
00:53:47,005 --> 00:53:50,090
- You know Marty.
- Hi.

788
00:53:50,091 --> 00:53:52,393
- Hi.
- Gay's our line Captain.

789
00:53:52,394 --> 00:53:55,563
- Hi.
- If you let me down,

790
00:53:55,564 --> 00:53:59,400
I could lose my reputation for
being such an all-knowing prick.

791
00:53:59,401 --> 00:54:02,186
I worked very hard
for that reputation,

792
00:54:02,187 --> 00:54:06,056
- So don't do it. Deal?
- Deal.

793
00:54:06,057 --> 00:54:09,559
- Gay will show you around.
- Let's get going.

794
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,980
Nomi, we'll do a run-through
this afternoon.

795
00:54:12,981 --> 00:54:14,848
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

796
00:54:14,849 --> 00:54:17,885
They always say that in Vegas
just before they take your money.

797
00:54:17,886 --> 00:54:20,287
You need to maintain
your weight.

798
00:54:20,288 --> 00:54:22,590
Eat a lot of brown rice
and vegetables.

799
00:54:22,591 --> 00:54:24,425
And stay indoors.

800
00:54:24,426 --> 00:54:26,594
I don't want to see tan lines.

801
00:54:26,595 --> 00:54:30,397
Your makeup and costumes are your
responsibility. Don't take them home.

802
00:54:30,398 --> 00:54:34,301
Whatever you do, don't ever,
ever go out on stage crying.

803
00:54:34,302 --> 00:54:37,655
You do eat brown rice and
vegetables, don't you?

804
00:54:37,656 --> 00:54:40,524
- Sure.
- Good.

805
00:54:40,525 --> 00:54:42,159
This is your table.

806
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:45,863
If you're smart...
and I was smart...

807
00:54:45,864 --> 00:54:48,365
You'll figure out
a job and a man

808
00:54:48,366 --> 00:54:52,636
- for later on.
- How'd you find your guy?

809
00:54:52,637 --> 00:54:56,307
I chipped my tooth on a quaalude.
He was my dentist.

810
00:54:56,308 --> 00:54:59,677
You'll be running this
monster six times a night.

811
00:54:59,678 --> 00:55:01,946
I'll take you up to personnel.

812
00:55:01,947 --> 00:55:06,000
- They want some information.
- What kind of information?

813
00:55:06,001 --> 00:55:08,519
Date of birth.

814
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:11,972
7-3, um... 73.

815
00:55:11,973 --> 00:55:15,959
- Place of birth.
- New York.

816
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:19,063
- New York, New York?
- Yeah.

817
00:55:19,064 --> 00:55:22,766
Nearest family members.

818
00:55:27,772 --> 00:55:30,174
I don't have any family.

819
00:55:30,175 --> 00:55:31,942
Deceased?

820
00:55:31,943 --> 00:55:34,411
Yes.

821
00:55:34,412 --> 00:55:37,414
Have you ever been arrested?

822
00:55:37,415 --> 00:55:39,516
<i>Charged with a criminal offense?</i>

823
00:55:39,517 --> 00:55:41,051
No.

824
00:55:45,206 --> 00:55:47,508
Social security.

825
00:55:47,509 --> 00:55:50,110
Uh...

826
00:55:50,111 --> 00:55:54,181
I don't know.
But let me check that for you, okay?

827
00:55:57,635 --> 00:56:00,504
Hey, you got it.

828
00:56:00,505 --> 00:56:02,723
Nice going.
That's great.

829
00:56:02,724 --> 00:56:04,358
Zack, this is Nomi Malone.

830
00:56:04,359 --> 00:56:06,510
Sure, I remember her. Hi.

831
00:56:06,511 --> 00:56:08,145
I bet you do remember her.

832
00:56:08,146 --> 00:56:09,947
Well, she's pretty memorable.

833
00:56:09,948 --> 00:56:12,583
Glad you're part of the team. Nice dress.

834
00:56:12,584 --> 00:56:14,368
It's a Versayce.

835
00:56:14,369 --> 00:56:16,537
It's <i>Versace.</i>

836
00:56:16,538 --> 00:56:18,205
What?

837
00:56:18,206 --> 00:56:22,626
Versace.
It's pronounced <i>Versace.</i>

838
00:56:22,627 --> 00:56:25,496
Oh.

839
00:56:25,497 --> 00:56:27,297
You got great taste.

840
00:56:27,298 --> 00:56:30,334
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

841
00:56:32,337 --> 00:56:35,139
Girls!
Up at the ceiling.

842
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:38,275
This is Nomi. Nicky, Julie, Deena.
You know Gay.

843
00:56:38,276 --> 00:56:41,979
They'll run through it.
You just watch and then we'll blend you in.

844
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:43,947
- Have you eaten anything?
- No.

845
00:56:43,948 --> 00:56:47,351
- Jack! What do you want?
- Burger, fries, and soda.

846
00:56:47,352 --> 00:56:49,353
Get her some brown rice, vegetables,

847
00:56:49,354 --> 00:56:54,291
And a bottle of Evian.
Nomi, no, come take a look at this first.

848
00:56:54,292 --> 00:56:58,429
Here we go! 5, 6, 7, 8!

849
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:01,432
Hah!
Hoh! 2, 3!

850
00:57:01,433 --> 00:57:04,802
Hah! Hah!

851
00:57:04,803 --> 00:57:06,603
Hah! There!

852
00:57:06,604 --> 00:57:08,672
- You're gonna try it now. You ready?
- Yeah.

853
00:57:08,673 --> 00:57:11,442
Try it now. Go!
5, 6, 7, hit it!

854
00:57:14,145 --> 00:57:17,714
Hoh! Bam!
Kick it! Work it!

855
00:57:17,715 --> 00:57:21,785
Hold it!
Nomi, what kind of turn was that?

856
00:57:21,786 --> 00:57:25,722
Do a piqué turn.
Come on. That's it.

857
00:57:25,723 --> 00:57:27,157
Okay, music.

858
00:57:27,158 --> 00:57:30,427
<i>Go! </i> Hah! Go!

859
00:57:30,428 --> 00:57:33,464
Yes! Hah!

860
00:57:33,465 --> 00:57:36,467
Higher.
Not that high.

861
00:57:37,836 --> 00:57:39,536
Stay in sync.

862
00:57:39,537 --> 00:57:42,306
1, 2, 3, 1!

863
00:57:42,307 --> 00:57:45,442
Thrust it! Thrust it!
Thrust it!

864
00:57:45,443 --> 00:57:49,012
Thrust it!
Come on, thrust it!

865
00:57:49,013 --> 00:57:51,748
Okay, that's enough.
Thank you, ladies.

866
00:57:56,321 --> 00:57:58,422
- Good job.
- Thank you.

867
00:57:58,423 --> 00:58:01,525
Gay, work with her on her turns.
I'm worried about her balance.

868
00:58:01,526 --> 00:58:03,844
How long before
I can do the show?

869
00:58:03,845 --> 00:58:06,613
You're starting tonight.

870
00:58:06,614 --> 00:58:09,917
- Tonight?
- You'll be fine.

871
00:58:11,753 --> 00:58:13,137
How did she do?

872
00:58:13,138 --> 00:58:14,688
She's no butterfly.

873
00:58:14,689 --> 00:58:16,690
Tony, she's all pelvic thrust.

874
00:58:16,691 --> 00:58:19,726
I mean, she prowls.
She's got it.

875
00:58:19,727 --> 00:58:22,095
I wonder how she got it.

876
00:58:22,096 --> 00:58:24,064
She certainly didn't learn it.

877
00:58:24,065 --> 00:58:26,500
She learned it, but they
don't teach it in any class.

878
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:30,604
Wait, you need more orange.

879
00:58:30,605 --> 00:58:32,272
Let me do it.

880
00:58:34,108 --> 00:58:37,277
- How do you feel?
- Oh! Don't ask.

881
00:58:37,278 --> 00:58:39,479
Who the hell took my makeup?

882
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:42,282
- Monkey alert! Monkey alert!
- No!

883
00:58:43,918 --> 00:58:45,519
<i>God damn it, Hector!</i>

884
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,521
I told you if this
happened again...

885
00:58:47,522 --> 00:58:50,791
- They make babies. I'm sorry.
- Babies?

886
00:58:50,792 --> 00:58:52,960
Oh! Oh, get out.

887
00:58:57,465 --> 00:58:59,299
<i>Grab her!</i> Grab her!

888
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:01,268
I've got one.

889
00:59:01,269 --> 00:59:03,103
Thank you.

890
00:59:03,104 --> 00:59:07,007
Julie, you fucking slut!
Touch my makeup again, I'll kill you!

891
00:59:07,008 --> 00:59:09,509
Oh, <i>I'm</i> a slut?
You fucked that kid from the pizza place.

892
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:11,144
You fucked the meter reader.

893
00:59:11,145 --> 00:59:13,513
- Bitch!
- You're fucking dead!

894
00:59:13,514 --> 00:59:18,185
Come on, you two!
For Christ sakes!

895
00:59:18,186 --> 00:59:21,154
Calm down!
Stop it!

896
00:59:21,155 --> 00:59:22,756
It's done!
It's done!

897
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:28,161
Showtime.

898
00:59:28,162 --> 00:59:30,931
Move it!
You got four counts of eight.

899
00:59:30,932 --> 00:59:32,633
Nomi, wait, your wig.

900
00:59:32,634 --> 00:59:35,202
You're fine.
Move up, you guys.

901
00:59:35,203 --> 00:59:37,971
There's shit on the stage, honey.

902
00:59:37,972 --> 00:59:39,740
It's that damn garlic.

903
00:59:39,741 --> 00:59:41,174
- Where is it, Jack?
- Up left.

904
00:59:41,175 --> 00:59:43,577
Guys, upstage left...
monkey shit.

905
00:59:43,578 --> 00:59:45,212
You want some blow?

906
00:59:45,213 --> 00:59:47,614
Last chance ice.

907
00:59:49,751 --> 00:59:52,853
<i>Go! Go!</i> Pick it up.
<i>Let's go.</i>

908
00:59:52,854 --> 00:59:55,022
<i>Come on, you guys.</i>
<i>Move faster.</i> Pick it up.

909
00:59:55,023 --> 00:59:56,990
<i>Brian, go!</i>

910
00:59:59,127 --> 01:00:00,727
See ya.

911
01:00:00,728 --> 01:00:03,247
<i>All right, everybody,
let's go!</i>

912
01:00:03,248 --> 01:00:05,048
<i>Go! Go! Go! Go!</i>

913
01:00:05,049 --> 01:00:07,084
I love you.

914
01:00:07,085 --> 01:00:10,637
Come on, you guys. Keep it moving.
Nomi, pick it up.

915
01:00:13,524 --> 01:00:17,110
Nomi, wait.
Two beats.

916
01:00:17,111 --> 01:00:19,730
1, 2. Go!

917
01:00:28,873 --> 01:00:31,441
- Oh!
- Shit.

918
01:00:48,359 --> 01:00:50,444
Yeah!

919
01:01:06,928 --> 01:01:10,797
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the
Stardust proudly presents...</i>

920
01:01:10,798 --> 01:01:13,100
<i>Miss Cristal Connors!</i>

921
01:02:05,053 --> 01:02:06,670
Yeah.

922
01:02:16,814 --> 01:02:19,683
Nomi, you got two minutes.
You gotta change into your red wig.

923
01:02:19,684 --> 01:02:22,319
I'll get your costume.

924
01:02:25,356 --> 01:02:27,891
Nomi, Nomi.

925
01:02:27,892 --> 01:02:29,493
Slip this on.

926
01:02:29,494 --> 01:02:31,695
- Did I do okay?
- Yeah, you did fine.

927
01:02:31,696 --> 01:02:34,614
Your right leg extension needs work.
Eight steps on the sweep, not six.

928
01:02:34,615 --> 01:02:36,516
I'll have someone work with you tomorrow.
Be here at noon.

929
01:02:36,517 --> 01:02:40,170
- Okay.
- Put this on. You're done.

930
01:02:40,171 --> 01:02:44,341
- Yay!
- Yay!

931
01:02:44,342 --> 01:02:46,243
I didn't fall.

932
01:02:46,244 --> 01:02:48,178
You did.
You nearly fell.

933
01:02:48,179 --> 01:02:51,148
Yo. Can I talk
to you a minute?

934
01:02:51,149 --> 01:02:54,317
Come on, please.

935
01:02:54,318 --> 01:02:56,052
Talk.

936
01:02:56,053 --> 01:02:58,021
Alone.

937
01:02:58,022 --> 01:03:00,424
- I'll get the car.
- I'll be right there.

938
01:03:02,994 --> 01:03:04,644
Yeah?

939
01:03:04,645 --> 01:03:06,279
Who sent you the flowers?

940
01:03:08,616 --> 01:03:10,200
None of your business.

941
01:03:10,201 --> 01:03:13,603
Okay, look, I just
wanted to say...

942
01:03:13,604 --> 01:03:15,806
You and me ain't got no ties.

943
01:03:20,578 --> 01:03:22,479
I have a problem with pussy.

944
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,464
I always have, always gonna.

945
01:03:24,465 --> 01:03:26,917
But I meant what I said.

946
01:03:26,918 --> 01:03:29,786
I'm not interested
in your problems.

947
01:03:29,787 --> 01:03:32,439
I did write it for you,

948
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,608
But I did tell her
I'd teach her

949
01:03:34,609 --> 01:03:36,810
I did write it
and I did fuck her.

950
01:03:36,811 --> 01:03:38,778
Who you fuck is your business,

951
01:03:38,779 --> 01:03:41,882
And I'm not making it mine.

952
01:03:41,883 --> 01:03:44,601
It's not like
I'm seeing any money

953
01:03:44,602 --> 01:03:46,486
for writing that number.

954
01:03:46,487 --> 01:03:49,489
I may well touch
a little pussy.

955
01:03:49,490 --> 01:03:53,276
You ain't got nothing to say?

956
01:03:53,277 --> 01:03:56,012
No.

957
01:03:56,013 --> 01:03:58,515
Thanks for the flowers.

958
01:03:58,516 --> 01:04:01,418
Tony said you did great.

959
01:04:01,419 --> 01:04:04,721
- I never got flowers before.
- Really?

960
01:04:04,722 --> 01:04:07,524
Well, I'm sure
you'll get lots of them.

961
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:11,495
He gave them to you?

962
01:04:11,496 --> 01:04:13,463
Yeah, he did.

963
01:04:13,464 --> 01:04:16,166
What is he, a pimp?

964
01:04:16,167 --> 01:04:18,702
Only people I know
got pimp cars are pimps.

965
01:04:18,703 --> 01:04:21,988
He's the
entertainment director.

966
01:04:21,989 --> 01:04:24,391
That's exactly what I
said... he's a pimp.

967
01:04:24,392 --> 01:04:26,560
<i>Hey, Nomes.
Let's go.</i>

968
01:04:28,763 --> 01:04:30,630
Good luck with
your number, James.

969
01:04:30,631 --> 01:04:32,699
I'm sure you're gonna teach her

970
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:35,101
to be a great dancer.

971
01:04:54,672 --> 01:04:56,640
Hello?

972
01:04:58,676 --> 01:05:02,112
- Anybody here?
- <i>Back here.</i>

973
01:05:03,648 --> 01:05:05,649
What are you doing here?

974
01:05:05,650 --> 01:05:07,734
What am I doing here?

975
01:05:07,735 --> 01:05:11,387
I'm doing some of the finest cocaine

976
01:05:11,388 --> 01:05:14,107
in the world, darlin'.
You want some?

977
01:05:14,108 --> 01:05:16,159
Mnh-mnh.

978
01:05:18,663 --> 01:05:21,031
It's great for the muscles.

979
01:05:23,801 --> 01:05:26,953
I told Marty I'd work on
your turns with you, darlin',

980
01:05:26,954 --> 01:05:30,040
but I'm feeling a little turned
inside-out myself today.

981
01:05:30,041 --> 01:05:31,725
Cut the shit.

982
01:05:31,726 --> 01:05:33,560
Okay.

983
01:05:33,861 --> 01:05:36,713
We got off on the wrong foot.

984
01:05:37,214 --> 01:05:40,917
You want to start
dancing all over again?

985
01:05:40,918 --> 01:05:44,721
- Why?
- Why not?

986
01:05:45,622 --> 01:05:49,092
You want to walk down to
Spago, get something to eat?

987
01:05:49,093 --> 01:05:50,727
Where is it?

988
01:05:50,728 --> 01:05:51,928
Just down
from <i>Versayce.</i>

989
01:05:51,929 --> 01:05:56,783
- Versace.
- Oh, right. Versace.

990
01:05:56,784 --> 01:05:58,618
Yeah.

991
01:05:58,619 --> 01:06:00,587
<i>Right this way.</i>

992
01:06:10,031 --> 01:06:11,865
Enjoy.

993
01:06:15,636 --> 01:06:17,771
I don't know what all this stuff is.

994
01:06:17,772 --> 01:06:19,773
I'll order for you.

995
01:06:19,774 --> 01:06:21,074
Don't they have

996
01:06:21,075 --> 01:06:23,143
brown rice and vegetables?

997
01:06:23,144 --> 01:06:26,663
Do you like brown rice and vegetables?

998
01:06:26,664 --> 01:06:28,498
Yeah.

999
01:06:28,499 --> 01:06:30,133
You do?

1000
01:06:30,134 --> 01:06:33,169
Sort of.

1001
01:06:33,170 --> 01:06:35,138
Really?

1002
01:06:37,541 --> 01:06:39,876
It's worse than dog food.

1003
01:06:39,877 --> 01:06:41,878
It is.

1004
01:06:43,914 --> 01:06:46,082
I've had dog food.

1005
01:06:47,718 --> 01:06:49,552
You have?

1006
01:06:49,553 --> 01:06:53,506
Mm-hmm.
A long time ago.

1007
01:06:53,507 --> 01:06:55,709
Doggy Chow.

1008
01:06:55,710 --> 01:06:59,062
I used to love Doggy Chow.

1009
01:06:59,063 --> 01:07:02,766
I used to love Doggy Chow too.

1010
01:07:14,979 --> 01:07:17,647
I get a headache from champagne.

1011
01:07:17,648 --> 01:07:20,550
Oh, this isn't champagne.

1012
01:07:20,551 --> 01:07:23,753
This is holy water.

1013
01:07:23,754 --> 01:07:26,656
I named myself after this holy water.

1014
01:07:26,657 --> 01:07:28,558
Chrissie Lou Connors

1015
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:30,560
used to have dingy brown hair

1016
01:07:30,561 --> 01:07:32,028
and little bitty tits.

1017
01:07:32,029 --> 01:07:35,899
It's amazing what paint
and a surgeon can do.

1018
01:07:44,575 --> 01:07:46,743
You have great tits.

1019
01:07:46,744 --> 01:07:49,112
They're really beautiful.

1020
01:07:49,113 --> 01:07:51,865
Thank you.

1021
01:07:51,866 --> 01:07:54,851
I like nice tits.

1022
01:07:54,852 --> 01:07:58,755
I always have.
How about you?

1023
01:07:58,756 --> 01:08:01,324
I like having nice tits.

1024
01:08:01,325 --> 01:08:04,360
How do you like having them?

1025
01:08:08,899 --> 01:08:10,900
What do you mean?

1026
01:08:10,901 --> 01:08:14,104
You know what I mean.

1027
01:08:17,174 --> 01:08:20,310
I like having them in a nice dress

1028
01:08:20,311 --> 01:08:23,179
or a tight top.

1029
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:24,948
Hmm.

1030
01:08:24,949 --> 01:08:27,917
You like to show them off.

1031
01:08:30,054 --> 01:08:32,722
I didn't like showing
them off at the Cheetah.

1032
01:08:32,723 --> 01:08:36,826
Why not?
I liked looking at them there.

1033
01:08:36,827 --> 01:08:39,729
Everybody liked looking
at them there.

1034
01:08:39,730 --> 01:08:42,499
Made me feel like a hooker.

1035
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:45,502
- You are a whore, darlin'.
- No, I'm not.

1036
01:08:45,503 --> 01:08:48,638
We all are.
We take the cash,

1037
01:08:48,639 --> 01:08:52,041
we cash the check.
We show them what they want to see.

1038
01:08:52,042 --> 01:08:55,211
Maybe you are a whore, but I'm not.

1039
01:08:57,948 --> 01:09:00,683
You and me...

1040
01:09:00,684 --> 01:09:02,952
we're exactly alike.

1041
01:09:05,156 --> 01:09:07,023
Mnh-mnh.

1042
01:09:11,729 --> 01:09:14,764
I'll never be like you.

1043
01:09:18,669 --> 01:09:21,771
Miss Connors, sorry to bother you.

1044
01:09:21,772 --> 01:09:23,406
Would you sign this for me?

1045
01:09:23,407 --> 01:09:25,642
I'd be happy to, darlin'.
What's your name?

1046
01:09:25,643 --> 01:09:28,478
Frank.
I'm from Galveston.

1047
01:09:28,479 --> 01:09:31,114
I'm just a little old farm girl
from Del Rio myself, Frank.

1048
01:09:31,115 --> 01:09:35,285
I told you she was from Texas.
Look at that.

1049
01:09:35,286 --> 01:09:37,253
Could I have me one?

1050
01:09:37,254 --> 01:09:40,223
You want a girl to use up
all her lipstick on you?

1051
01:09:40,224 --> 01:09:42,192
You want to dance?

1052
01:09:42,193 --> 01:09:44,661
- Right now?
- It's now or never.

1053
01:09:44,662 --> 01:09:46,930
That's what Elvis said.

1054
01:09:50,050 --> 01:09:52,268
Know the best advice I ever got?

1055
01:09:52,269 --> 01:09:54,837
You're up there on stage,

1056
01:09:54,838 --> 01:09:56,940
Hoping on a spot.

1057
01:09:56,941 --> 01:10:00,509
If someone gets in your
way, step on them.

1058
01:10:00,510 --> 01:10:03,179
If you're the only one
left standing there,

1059
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:06,816
they hire you. That's about it.

1060
01:10:06,817 --> 01:10:09,068
Thank you and good night,
ladies and gentlemen.

1061
01:10:09,069 --> 01:10:11,654
Elvis has left the building.

1062
01:11:17,621 --> 01:11:19,689
You see, darlin'?

1063
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:21,724
You are a whore.

1064
01:11:24,795 --> 01:11:26,362
Bitch.

1065
01:11:31,318 --> 01:11:33,403
I guess we're done.

1066
01:11:38,609 --> 01:11:42,745
Right here. Right here. Thank you.

1067
01:11:45,482 --> 01:11:48,651
- Nicky, can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

1068
01:11:48,652 --> 01:11:51,971
Listen, after the show...

1069
01:11:51,972 --> 01:11:54,741
Coming through.

1070
01:11:54,742 --> 01:11:58,511
- Mommy, can we see the monkeys?
- Not now. They're busy.

1071
01:11:58,512 --> 01:12:01,130
- Please, they're so cute.
- They have to work.

1072
01:12:01,131 --> 01:12:04,801
- What are they doing?
- I want to see the monkeys!

1073
01:12:04,802 --> 01:12:06,736
Why can't we see the monkeys?

1074
01:12:06,737 --> 01:12:08,621
Get these fucking kids out of here!

1075
01:12:08,622 --> 01:12:10,623
You said the "f" word.

1076
01:12:10,624 --> 01:12:12,158
She said the "f" word.

1077
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:14,177
<i>You said the "f" word.</i>

1078
01:12:14,178 --> 01:12:15,712
Shut the fuck up.

1079
01:12:17,648 --> 01:12:21,384
Shh. It's okay.

1080
01:12:23,037 --> 01:12:26,222
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Let's get out of here.

1081
01:12:26,223 --> 01:12:29,492
Nomi, there's a boat convention

1082
01:12:29,493 --> 01:12:32,228
coming into town next week.
They need a couple of girls.

1083
01:12:32,229 --> 01:12:34,297
Nicky's doing it.
You interested?

1084
01:12:34,298 --> 01:12:35,765
Pays $1,000.

1085
01:12:37,301 --> 01:12:39,835
$1,000?

1086
01:12:39,836 --> 01:12:41,220
To do what?

1087
01:12:41,221 --> 01:12:43,122
Just represent
your hotel for a day...

1088
01:12:43,123 --> 01:12:46,192
Wear your costumes and your smile
and they take your picture.

1089
01:12:46,193 --> 01:12:49,862
- $1,000?
- Mm-hmm.

1090
01:12:49,863 --> 01:12:51,931
Yeah.

1091
01:12:51,932 --> 01:12:54,801
Great.
Cristal here recommended you.

1092
01:12:57,821 --> 01:12:59,989
Thanks.

1093
01:12:59,990 --> 01:13:03,493
My pleasure, darlin'.
Just looking out for you.

1094
01:13:03,494 --> 01:13:07,230
- We got to talk about that magazine layout.
- Later, later, later.

1095
01:13:07,231 --> 01:13:08,748
Don't do it.

1096
01:13:08,749 --> 01:13:10,750
What? It's $1,000.
Why not?

1097
01:13:10,751 --> 01:13:13,702
- Molly, I need you.
- Yes, I'm coming.

1098
01:13:13,703 --> 01:13:17,840
- I know some girls who've done it before.
- Molly, I'm waiting.

1099
01:13:17,841 --> 01:13:20,610
They didn't like it.

1100
01:13:26,216 --> 01:13:28,151
Did you do it before?

1101
01:13:28,152 --> 01:13:30,886
- Yeah.
- Did you like it?

1102
01:13:30,887 --> 01:13:34,006
Did I like it?
Sure, I liked it.

1103
01:13:59,399 --> 01:14:01,768
<i>Let's hear it for these
two beautiful girls</i>

1104
01:14:01,769 --> 01:14:05,004
<i>from "Goddess," the new
smash at the Stardust!</i>

1105
01:14:07,174 --> 01:14:09,509
- Thank you.
- Pardon me.

1106
01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:12,879
- Hey, hey, guys.
- Shit, here he comes.

1107
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:14,447
- How's it going?
- Hi.

1108
01:14:14,448 --> 01:14:17,383
- Tough gig, huh?
- Very tough.

1109
01:14:17,384 --> 01:14:21,087
This is my good friend Mr.
Okida. He's from Bangkok.

1110
01:14:21,088 --> 01:14:24,123
He's one of our very,
very high rollers.

1111
01:14:24,124 --> 01:14:26,292
Ladies, we got a great idea.

1112
01:14:26,293 --> 01:14:29,028
We want to take you girls
to dinner after the show...

1113
01:14:29,029 --> 01:14:31,330
have some lobster, hear Caesar sing.

1114
01:14:31,331 --> 01:14:34,867
You ever heard Caesar sing?
Man, that guy's great.

1115
01:14:34,868 --> 01:14:36,369
You'll love him.

1116
01:14:36,370 --> 01:14:39,071
- Caesar sing.
- Yeah, Caesar will sing,

1117
01:14:39,072 --> 01:14:41,574
And then we'll go back to
my place and we'll sing,

1118
01:14:41,575 --> 01:14:44,577
<i>Just the four of us.</i>

1119
01:14:44,578 --> 01:14:46,746
How about it?

1120
01:14:48,749 --> 01:14:50,917
We sing.

1121
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:56,689
Yeah, we'll sing
a lot of songs.

1122
01:14:56,690 --> 01:15:00,193
- Yeah?
- Okay.

1123
01:15:00,194 --> 01:15:04,730
- Okay, good deal.
- Okay, good deal.

1124
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:08,668
Not me.

1125
01:15:08,669 --> 01:15:12,705
Whoa.
Excuse me. Hey!

1126
01:15:12,706 --> 01:15:15,141
Hey, hey! Be nice.

1127
01:15:15,142 --> 01:15:17,276
Get your hands off me!

1128
01:15:17,277 --> 01:15:18,945
You're getting $1,000 for this.

1129
01:15:18,946 --> 01:15:21,497
For this! This!

1130
01:15:21,498 --> 01:15:24,433
Hey, forget it. Just forget it.
No harm done.

1131
01:15:24,434 --> 01:15:26,202
No damage.

1132
01:15:26,203 --> 01:15:27,970
Christ.

1133
01:15:27,971 --> 01:15:31,274
<i>Is that right?
Okay, tell me another one.</i>

1134
01:15:31,275 --> 01:15:35,695
<i>- No, it's the truth.
- Come on, just tell me one more.</i>

1135
01:15:35,696 --> 01:15:38,164
- Zack.
- Yeah

1136
01:15:38,165 --> 01:15:40,132
I want to talk to you.

1137
01:15:40,133 --> 01:15:43,569
Sure.

1138
01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:45,571
Let's go upstairs.

1139
01:15:45,572 --> 01:15:48,658
Did you have a nice day, darlin'?

1140
01:15:48,659 --> 01:15:50,493
No.

1141
01:15:52,379 --> 01:15:55,331
I'm sorry to hear that.

1142
01:15:57,117 --> 01:15:59,802
Jesus.

1143
01:16:02,472 --> 01:16:04,373
I'm sorry.

1144
01:16:04,374 --> 01:16:07,343
Some people just don't get it.

1145
01:16:07,344 --> 01:16:09,312
I'm on the stage.

1146
01:16:09,313 --> 01:16:11,480
<i>Get me Phil Newkirk,
would you?</i>

1147
01:16:11,481 --> 01:16:14,734
- Right.
- Thank you.

1148
01:16:14,735 --> 01:16:16,135
I want you to stay.

1149
01:16:17,771 --> 01:16:21,691
Yeah, the drop is up 32%
on those 58 machines.

1150
01:16:21,692 --> 01:16:24,277
<i>It's gonna make your
bottom line about 250.</i>

1151
01:16:24,278 --> 01:16:26,229
<i>Right.</i>

1152
01:16:26,230 --> 01:16:28,447
Okay.

1153
01:16:28,448 --> 01:16:30,499
I got an mba for this.

1154
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:33,369
That's what this
business has come to...

1155
01:16:33,370 --> 01:16:35,254
Cost-analyzing
every slot machine.

1156
01:16:35,255 --> 01:16:38,174
What's an mba?

1157
01:16:38,175 --> 01:16:39,908
An mba is a degree...

1158
01:16:39,909 --> 01:16:42,845
Zack, you in here?
Yeah.

1159
01:16:42,846 --> 01:16:44,764
Excuse me.

1160
01:16:44,765 --> 01:16:47,450
Hey, hey, hey.
What's going on?

1161
01:16:47,451 --> 01:16:50,553
I ever hear this again
you're out of here.

1162
01:16:50,554 --> 01:16:52,688
- Zack, nothing happened.
- Yeah, something happened.

1163
01:16:52,689 --> 01:16:54,540
She's jumping to conclusions.

1164
01:16:54,541 --> 01:16:56,809
If that happens again
to anybody,

1165
01:16:56,810 --> 01:16:59,545
You're gonna jump
to your conclusion

1166
01:16:59,546 --> 01:17:01,614
without your golden parachute.

1167
01:17:01,615 --> 01:17:04,500
You owe her an apology.

1168
01:17:07,471 --> 01:17:11,057
Nomi, I'm sorry.
I apologize.

1169
01:17:11,058 --> 01:17:14,243
Yeah, fine. Okay.

1170
01:17:16,513 --> 01:17:18,631
- Get out of here.
- Yeah.

1171
01:17:18,632 --> 01:17:21,467
Give me some juice
on three and four.

1172
01:17:21,468 --> 01:17:24,470
An MBA's a degree
you pick up in college.

1173
01:17:24,471 --> 01:17:27,306
It's mostly worthless
in the real world.

1174
01:17:27,307 --> 01:17:29,475
<i>Let's get
an audio check.</i>

1175
01:17:29,476 --> 01:17:31,644
You go for it, don't you?

1176
01:17:31,645 --> 01:17:34,847
Yeah, I try to.

1177
01:17:37,567 --> 01:17:39,635
Showtime.

1178
01:17:39,636 --> 01:17:41,070
That's for sure.

1179
01:17:41,071 --> 01:17:44,724
Bring both of those back up.

1180
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:53,632
Phil, you dumb fuck, get
back up here, would you?

1181
01:17:54,601 --> 01:17:56,752
I know. I know.

1182
01:18:04,544 --> 01:18:07,179
I want to thank you
for looking out for me.

1183
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:09,765
So nice of you
to recommend me to Phil.

1184
01:18:09,766 --> 01:18:13,269
What are friends for?

1185
01:18:13,270 --> 01:18:15,471
Right.

1186
01:18:20,077 --> 01:18:22,778
Molly, you were right
about the convention.

1187
01:18:24,231 --> 01:18:26,132
Ooh! Sweet baby.

1188
01:18:26,133 --> 01:18:29,969
Do that again, I'll break
your fucking fingers.

1189
01:18:29,970 --> 01:18:32,505
I can't help it you don't
have a gay partner.

1190
01:18:32,506 --> 01:18:33,739
Fuck you.

1191
01:18:33,740 --> 01:18:36,776
He wants everybody to
see how hetero he is.

1192
01:18:36,777 --> 01:18:38,477
Molly, bring your flashlight.

1193
01:18:38,478 --> 01:18:40,212
I want to see how big it is.

1194
01:18:40,213 --> 01:18:42,515
You want a knuckle sandwich?

1195
01:18:42,516 --> 01:18:44,483
Aw, can I have
mine anally, please?

1196
01:18:44,484 --> 01:18:46,485
Come on, you guys,
stop. Jesus!

1197
01:18:46,486 --> 01:18:49,188
<i>Is everybody here?
Let's line it up.</i>

1198
01:18:49,189 --> 01:18:51,057
What are you looking at, bitch?

1199
01:18:51,058 --> 01:18:53,626
All right, let's go.
Let's move it. Go, go, go!

1200
01:19:32,265 --> 01:19:34,583
Oh, my god.

1201
01:19:50,450 --> 01:19:53,502
Whoa!

1202
01:19:58,074 --> 01:20:02,878
Oh, my god.
Are you okay, Annie?

1203
01:20:18,695 --> 01:20:22,698
- Don't move.
- Is it broken?

1204
01:20:22,699 --> 01:20:24,567
It's my leg or something.

1205
01:20:24,568 --> 01:20:26,268
Tell me when
you feel something.

1206
01:20:26,269 --> 01:20:28,804
- Ah!
- It's her knee.

1207
01:20:28,805 --> 01:20:30,873
It isn't broken, is it?

1208
01:20:30,874 --> 01:20:32,541
Daryl, what happened?

1209
01:20:32,542 --> 01:20:34,710
My foot went out from under me.

1210
01:20:34,711 --> 01:20:36,612
Hey!

1211
01:20:36,613 --> 01:20:38,714
This is what happened.

1212
01:20:40,383 --> 01:20:42,751
I wonder how those
got up there.

1213
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:45,488
They probably
came off a costume.

1214
01:20:45,489 --> 01:20:48,057
We're gonna take you
to the hospital.

1215
01:20:48,058 --> 01:20:53,162
- Shit, no!
- Jesus. Poor Annie. Tough break.

1216
01:20:53,163 --> 01:20:55,431
Let us through here, please.

1217
01:20:58,385 --> 01:21:00,236
Okay, see you later.

1218
01:21:00,237 --> 01:21:03,305
<i>I'm the producer.
It's my show.</i>

1219
01:21:03,306 --> 01:21:05,674
I hired your show. You're my producer.
You'll do what I say.

1220
01:21:05,675 --> 01:21:07,443
She was my understudy.
I want a voice in this.

1221
01:21:07,444 --> 01:21:10,345
<i>You can have
a voice in this...</i>

1222
01:21:10,346 --> 01:21:12,748
It is broken, kids.

1223
01:21:12,749 --> 01:21:15,350
Shit. That'll
be three months.

1224
01:21:15,351 --> 01:21:17,786
At least.

1225
01:21:17,787 --> 01:21:20,539
Bad karma, huh?

1226
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:23,492
Nomi, your mother's
waiting for you.

1227
01:21:23,493 --> 01:21:24,827
My mother?

1228
01:21:24,828 --> 01:21:28,697
Well, for your sake,
I hope she's not.

1229
01:21:28,698 --> 01:21:32,551
<i>If a light sleeper can
sleep with a light on,</i>

1230
01:21:32,552 --> 01:21:35,170
<i>Can a hard sleeper
sleep with a hard-on?</i>

1231
01:21:35,171 --> 01:21:39,241
What do you call a tiger?
A tiger's a big pussy...

1232
01:21:39,242 --> 01:21:41,544
Henry!

1233
01:21:43,313 --> 01:21:47,516
I can get shit on, but I
don't like getting spit on.

1234
01:21:47,517 --> 01:21:51,203
- Hi.
- Hi, al.

1235
01:21:51,204 --> 01:21:52,738
You look like shit.

1236
01:21:52,739 --> 01:21:57,343
She looks better than a 10-inch
dick, and you know it.

1237
01:21:57,344 --> 01:22:00,195
So, you like it here?

1238
01:22:00,196 --> 01:22:02,331
What, you think she's gonna miss you?

1239
01:22:02,332 --> 01:22:05,751
Yeah, why not?
We miss her.

1240
01:22:05,752 --> 01:22:08,621
She misses us like
that lump on my twat.

1241
01:22:08,622 --> 01:22:11,907
- I had taken off last week.
- Oh, Jesus, Henry.

1242
01:22:19,616 --> 01:22:22,651
I saw the show.

1243
01:22:22,652 --> 01:22:24,970
You were good.

1244
01:22:26,389 --> 01:22:28,290
Thank you, al.

1245
01:22:32,529 --> 01:22:34,363
Real good.

1246
01:22:36,866 --> 01:22:39,735
You take care, kid.

1247
01:22:45,875 --> 01:22:48,744
Must be weird not having
anybody come on you.

1248
01:22:54,784 --> 01:22:57,670
Nomi. You want a ride?

1249
01:23:00,289 --> 01:23:03,225
- I got one.
- Okay, good night.

1250
01:23:05,562 --> 01:23:07,613
Wait.

1251
01:23:09,549 --> 01:23:13,619
- You ever been in one of these?
- No.

1252
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:15,788
I always wanted one.

1253
01:23:18,258 --> 01:23:20,876
- Some car, isn't it?
- It doesn't suck.

1254
01:23:20,877 --> 01:23:23,662
All right.
Where we headed?

1255
01:23:23,663 --> 01:23:26,315
You have to give me directions.

1256
01:23:26,316 --> 01:23:28,384
To your place.

1257
01:23:47,503 --> 01:23:49,338
Do you like Cristal?

1258
01:23:49,339 --> 01:23:52,358
I like a lot of different champagnes,

1259
01:23:52,359 --> 01:23:55,411
But I always stick
with champagne.

1260
01:23:57,480 --> 01:24:00,315
What's Andrew Carver like?

1261
01:24:00,316 --> 01:24:03,185
You nervous?
Don't be.

1262
01:24:03,186 --> 01:24:05,320
I'm not.

1263
01:24:09,576 --> 01:24:12,461
I liked it when you came.

1264
01:24:15,364 --> 01:24:17,416
I liked your eyes.

1265
01:25:18,294 --> 01:25:20,195
Mmm. Oh!

1266
01:27:28,557 --> 01:27:31,660
Hey, stay with me.

1267
01:27:31,661 --> 01:27:33,912
I'll drive you back
in the morning.

1268
01:27:33,913 --> 01:27:36,365
It is morning.

1269
01:27:36,366 --> 01:27:39,585
- Please.
- I've got a taxi coming.

1270
01:27:39,586 --> 01:27:41,703
Send it back.

1271
01:27:46,459 --> 01:27:49,544
Cristal needs a new understudy.

1272
01:27:49,545 --> 01:27:52,514
There's an audition at noon.

1273
01:27:52,515 --> 01:27:54,967
You want to try?

1274
01:27:54,968 --> 01:27:56,969
Would you have told me about it

1275
01:27:56,970 --> 01:27:58,804
if I hadn't come here?

1276
01:27:58,805 --> 01:28:01,640
It wasn't my idea to come here.
It was yours.

1277
01:28:06,145 --> 01:28:08,780
I want to see you again.

1278
01:28:08,781 --> 01:28:11,483
We'll see how it goes.

1279
01:28:14,988 --> 01:28:17,072
What, the audition?

1280
01:28:26,966 --> 01:28:29,401
$10.50.

1281
01:28:29,402 --> 01:28:31,803
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

1282
01:28:37,844 --> 01:28:39,911
Hello.

1283
01:28:40,980 --> 01:28:43,782
Mmm. I hate you.

1284
01:28:43,783 --> 01:28:46,785
- Who was he?
- Zack.

1285
01:28:46,786 --> 01:28:50,756
Oh, my god.
Did you tie him up?

1286
01:28:50,757 --> 01:28:53,225
- Oh, shit.
- What?

1287
01:28:53,226 --> 01:28:55,410
I forgot to untie him.

1288
01:28:59,148 --> 01:29:00,648
Are you high?

1289
01:29:00,649 --> 01:29:02,834
Maybe a little.

1290
01:29:02,835 --> 01:29:05,804
Oh. I can't go
to sleep now.

1291
01:29:05,805 --> 01:29:09,307
I've got an audition at noon.
Where are the sugar snaps?

1292
01:29:09,308 --> 01:29:13,679
In the cupboard.
Nomi, don't get sucked into it.

1293
01:29:16,015 --> 01:29:18,684
Uh-oh. Look
what I found.

1294
01:29:20,953 --> 01:29:23,188
Okay, whatever, Nomes.

1295
01:29:52,969 --> 01:29:54,553
Julie.

1296
01:29:54,554 --> 01:29:57,639
- She's not hot enough.
- She's got it down.

1297
01:29:57,640 --> 01:29:59,874
You can teach them
to get it down.

1298
01:29:59,875 --> 01:30:01,893
She doesn't have Cristal's heat.

1299
01:30:01,894 --> 01:30:04,396
None of them have Cristal's heat.

1300
01:30:04,397 --> 01:30:06,732
I do love you, Gay.

1301
01:30:06,733 --> 01:30:09,017
Nomi's got heat.

1302
01:30:09,018 --> 01:30:11,486
Does she now?

1303
01:30:11,487 --> 01:30:13,438
<i>Yes, she does.</i>

1304
01:30:13,439 --> 01:30:17,109
In a totally different
way, of course.

1305
01:30:17,110 --> 01:30:20,495
Come on! She's
gonna take the lead?

1306
01:30:20,496 --> 01:30:23,615
This is a hotel show.
This isn't the Cheetah.

1307
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:25,534
Nobody's gonna take
my lead anyway, darlin'.

1308
01:30:25,535 --> 01:30:27,619
I haven't missed a
show in eight years.

1309
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:30,405
You're not getting any
younger, darlin'.

1310
01:30:30,406 --> 01:30:33,408
- Eat me.
- You want to do it again with just Nomi?

1311
01:30:33,409 --> 01:30:36,077
- No.
- Yeah, I do. Set it up, Marty.

1312
01:30:36,078 --> 01:30:39,681
This is bullshit.
It's about your dick.

1313
01:30:39,682 --> 01:30:41,133
Nicky, Julie, thank you.

1314
01:30:41,134 --> 01:30:43,435
What do we know about her?

1315
01:30:43,436 --> 01:30:45,887
Nothing.
I'm not even sure she gave us

1316
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:48,023
- the right social security number.
- Find out, would you?

1317
01:30:48,024 --> 01:30:49,724
- Find out what?
- Everything.

1318
01:31:02,705 --> 01:31:05,957
You fucked her, didn't you?

1319
01:31:05,958 --> 01:31:08,710
That piss you off because
you're jealous, Cris,

1320
01:31:08,711 --> 01:31:12,798
or because I beat you to the punch?

1321
01:31:33,569 --> 01:31:37,072
You fuck him for the spot
or because you wanted to?

1322
01:31:40,743 --> 01:31:42,744
I say you did it for the spot.

1323
01:31:42,745 --> 01:31:46,281
Is that what you did, Cristal?

1324
01:31:46,282 --> 01:31:48,750
You don't want to piss me off

1325
01:31:48,751 --> 01:31:51,019
now that we're friends.

1326
01:31:51,020 --> 01:31:53,555
No, you shouldn't get pissed off.

1327
01:31:53,556 --> 01:31:56,158
It makes you look older.

1328
01:32:00,663 --> 01:32:03,832
- <i>Nomi.</i>
- Yeah?

1329
01:32:03,833 --> 01:32:06,134
You got it.

1330
01:32:06,135 --> 01:32:08,603
- I do?
- Yeah.

1331
01:32:08,604 --> 01:32:11,022
Marty and Gay are gonna work with you.

1332
01:32:11,023 --> 01:32:14,676
We'll get some glossies taken.
You did good.

1333
01:32:14,677 --> 01:32:16,645
I'll call you for dinner.

1334
01:32:16,646 --> 01:32:19,381
We'll have some lobster.
Did you ever hear Caesar sing?

1335
01:32:19,382 --> 01:32:21,082
You'll love it.

1336
01:32:31,294 --> 01:32:33,461
What?

1337
01:32:34,664 --> 01:32:38,200
Congratulations. I see
you have many talents.

1338
01:32:38,201 --> 01:32:40,902
I thought she did good.

1339
01:33:01,607 --> 01:33:04,693
I didn't even know about the audition

1340
01:33:04,694 --> 01:33:06,745
until afterwards.

1341
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:11,783
Do you like my nails?

1342
01:33:23,629 --> 01:33:25,764
Not as nice as yours.

1343
01:33:29,702 --> 01:33:33,722
Maybe I'll help you
with yours sometime.

1344
01:33:37,176 --> 01:33:39,577
If you want.

1345
01:33:42,515 --> 01:33:45,684
Isn't that nice of you, darlin'?

1346
01:33:45,685 --> 01:33:48,253
What are friends for?

1347
01:33:55,611 --> 01:34:00,015
On second thought...

1348
01:34:00,016 --> 01:34:02,484
I'm not sure I want you to do mine.

1349
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:07,389
I'm getting a little too
old for that whorey look.

1350
01:34:08,524 --> 01:34:12,460
I'll think about it.

1351
01:34:12,461 --> 01:34:14,562
Okay.

1352
01:34:14,563 --> 01:34:17,515
Close the door on your way out.

1353
01:35:08,818 --> 01:35:11,986
<i>You gotta be shitting me!
This is bullshit!</i>

1354
01:35:11,987 --> 01:35:15,173
Hey, bring on the real dancers!

1355
01:35:22,865 --> 01:35:26,868
You suck! Get off the stage!
Shit! Get off there!

1356
01:35:26,869 --> 01:35:30,171
<i>All right! All right!
Enough of this stuff.</i>

1357
01:35:30,172 --> 01:35:32,507
<i>Let's dance!</i>

1358
01:35:40,433 --> 01:35:42,350
Hey!

1359
01:35:42,351 --> 01:35:46,554
- Hey.
- I loved it. It was good.

1360
01:35:46,555 --> 01:35:48,490
What are you doing here... slumming?

1361
01:35:48,491 --> 01:35:50,592
- Heather!
- Hope!

1362
01:35:50,593 --> 01:35:52,644
Were we good?

1363
01:35:52,645 --> 01:35:54,112
You were great.

1364
01:35:54,113 --> 01:35:56,448
She dances like a truck.

1365
01:35:56,449 --> 01:35:57,732
I do not!

1366
01:35:57,733 --> 01:35:59,551
Do you want something to drink?

1367
01:35:59,552 --> 01:36:01,753
Yeah, get me a beer, bitch.

1368
01:36:01,754 --> 01:36:04,856
Look what I got.

1369
01:36:06,225 --> 01:36:07,625
It's beautiful.

1370
01:36:07,626 --> 01:36:10,128
I stole it from my grandmother.

1371
01:36:10,129 --> 01:36:13,765
You did not!
You got it at a pawn shop.

1372
01:36:22,558 --> 01:36:26,227
We're getting married.

1373
01:36:26,228 --> 01:36:28,196
You love her?

1374
01:36:29,315 --> 01:36:32,150
I don't know.
She's having a baby.

1375
01:36:36,405 --> 01:36:38,206
What about this?

1376
01:36:38,207 --> 01:36:40,542
We ain't any good.
You heard them.

1377
01:36:40,543 --> 01:36:43,411
"Get outta here!
Get off the stage!"

1378
01:36:45,247 --> 01:36:48,666
What are you gonna do?

1379
01:36:48,667 --> 01:36:52,286
Work in a grocery store.
Her mother owns it.

1380
01:36:52,287 --> 01:36:55,757
We'll get a discount on baby food.

1381
01:37:07,353 --> 01:37:09,337
See ya.

1382
01:37:12,441 --> 01:37:15,326
Shit happens, you know?
Life sucks.

1383
01:37:15,327 --> 01:37:17,529
I'm a student of t-shirts.

1384
01:37:28,424 --> 01:37:30,508
Hey, Nicky.

1385
01:37:56,719 --> 01:37:58,720
Hey, excuse me.
Wait! You cannot go...

1386
01:37:58,721 --> 01:38:00,605
What's going on?

1387
01:38:00,606 --> 01:38:02,240
What do you mean
"what's going on?"

1388
01:38:02,241 --> 01:38:03,741
Hey, cool it, all right?

1389
01:38:03,742 --> 01:38:07,045
Cool it? You told me I got
it, then sent me this?

1390
01:38:07,046 --> 01:38:09,998
I didn't have a choice. She threatened
to walk, got her lawyers into it.

1391
01:38:09,999 --> 01:38:14,235
- So what?
- So she's a star. You're not worth it.

1392
01:38:14,236 --> 01:38:18,273
I'm sorry, Nomi.
I tried. Fuck!

1393
01:38:18,274 --> 01:38:21,175
So basically, my g-string snapped.

1394
01:38:21,176 --> 01:38:24,379
So there I was, dancing butt
naked for five minutes.

1395
01:38:24,380 --> 01:38:26,447
I mean, my poor partner.

1396
01:38:28,250 --> 01:38:32,987
Hey... I thought
about it, darlin'.

1397
01:38:32,988 --> 01:38:35,857
You think you could do my nails now?

1398
01:38:39,762 --> 01:38:43,064
Oh, okay.

1399
01:38:43,065 --> 01:38:45,266
<i>Maybe some other time.</i>

1400
01:40:56,398 --> 01:40:59,467
Come on...
Slave girl.

1401
01:41:02,788 --> 01:41:05,973
- Ha ha ha!
- Let's go, go!

1402
01:41:07,542 --> 01:41:11,729
Run, run, run! Go, run, run, run!
Go, go, run!

1403
01:41:11,730 --> 01:41:14,265
<i>Go, go, run, go!</i>

1404
01:41:17,820 --> 01:41:19,287
Aah.

1405
01:41:19,288 --> 01:41:21,022
<i>You guys, let me through!</i>

1406
01:41:21,023 --> 01:41:24,492
- Oh, my god!
- Shit!

1407
01:41:24,493 --> 01:41:26,260
Cristal, can you hear me?

1408
01:41:27,529 --> 01:41:29,447
Somebody get Marty here!

1409
01:41:29,448 --> 01:41:30,965
<i>Marty!</i>

1410
01:41:34,369 --> 01:41:37,171
- What the hell happened?
- I don't know.

1411
01:41:37,172 --> 01:41:39,207
Somebody get an ambulance now!

1412
01:41:39,208 --> 01:41:40,475
Who was behind her?

1413
01:41:40,476 --> 01:41:44,445
- I was.
- What happened?

1414
01:41:44,446 --> 01:41:48,466
I don't know.
She just went down.

1415
01:41:48,467 --> 01:41:51,302
She slipped.
I saw it.

1416
01:41:53,756 --> 01:41:56,057
Nomi wasn't even close to her.

1417
01:42:12,291 --> 01:42:14,375
Tough break, huh?

1418
01:42:17,045 --> 01:42:20,915
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

1419
01:42:38,150 --> 01:42:40,735
Mm-hmm.

1420
01:42:40,736 --> 01:42:43,855
All right, thanks.
Keep me informed.

1421
01:42:43,856 --> 01:42:45,773
Well, she's got a concussion.

1422
01:42:45,774 --> 01:42:47,408
That'll be all right.

1423
01:42:47,409 --> 01:42:50,311
But she's got a compound
fracture of the right hip.

1424
01:42:50,312 --> 01:42:54,148
You know how long
those take to heal?

1425
01:42:54,149 --> 01:42:55,950
We got to shut the show down.

1426
01:42:55,951 --> 01:42:59,170
Not a chance.
The show goes on.

1427
01:42:59,171 --> 01:43:02,757
The Stardust is never dark.
It's never been.

1428
01:43:02,758 --> 01:43:06,460
It never will be,
not while I'm alive.

1429
01:43:06,461 --> 01:43:08,179
Who was her understudy?

1430
01:43:08,180 --> 01:43:10,498
Well, we had a girl who...

1431
01:43:12,500 --> 01:43:15,169
- What's funny?
- Cristal Connors is a star, Sam.

1432
01:43:15,170 --> 01:43:17,388
You can't just replace her.

1433
01:43:22,744 --> 01:43:25,630
What if we could we just bring
somebody in while she's recuperating?

1434
01:43:25,631 --> 01:43:28,682
- She could be out a year.
- Like who?

1435
01:43:28,683 --> 01:43:30,701
Janet Jackson.
Paula Abdul.

1436
01:43:30,702 --> 01:43:32,870
Paula Abdul.
In my show?

1437
01:43:32,871 --> 01:43:35,039
We're not gonna pay
those kinds of salaries.

1438
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:37,875
In that case,

1439
01:43:37,876 --> 01:43:39,794
We do what we do in Vegas.

1440
01:43:39,795 --> 01:43:42,696
- What?
- We gamble.

1441
01:43:45,500 --> 01:43:47,985
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1442

We could've brought anyone into this
show... Janet Jackson, Paula Abdul.

1445
01:45:03,495 --> 01:45:07,431
Nomi Malone is what
Las Vegas is all about.

1446
01:45:07,432 --> 01:45:10,101
She's dazzling, she's exciting,

1447
01:45:10,102 --> 01:45:14,772
- And very, very sexy. Thank you, Zack.
- Yes, sir.

1448
01:45:14,773 --> 01:45:17,808
Miss Malone, how did you
feel about the show tonight?

1449
01:45:17,809 --> 01:45:20,745
I just hope I can be
as good as the show.

1450
01:45:20,746 --> 01:45:22,880
You are, my dear.

1451
01:45:22,881 --> 01:45:25,916
- You <i>are</i> the show.
- <i>Hear!</i> Hear!

1452
01:45:25,917 --> 01:45:27,918
Miss Malone, please.

1453
01:45:27,919 --> 01:45:29,754
<i>Come on, come on,
over here, Nomi.</i>

1454
01:45:29,755 --> 01:45:33,124
<i>That's great, Nomi.</i>
<i>One more.</i> Please, please.

1455
01:45:33,125 --> 01:45:35,359
<i>Congratulations, Nomi.</i>

1456
01:45:36,928 --> 01:45:38,796
Hey, you ready to party?

1457
01:45:38,797 --> 01:45:42,266
- Where?
- The Paradiso. I rented out the bungalows.

1458
01:45:42,267 --> 01:45:45,369
- For what?
- For you.

1459
01:45:45,370 --> 01:45:47,371
Yay!

1460
01:45:47,372 --> 01:45:49,240
Hurry up.
I got a limo waiting.

1461
01:45:49,241 --> 01:45:52,777
- I don't have anything to wear.
- Yes, you do.

1462
01:45:52,778 --> 01:45:56,914
Andrew Carver's coming. He saw the show.
He thought you were great!

1463
01:45:56,915 --> 01:46:00,951
Did you hear that?
Andrew Carver is gonna be there!

1464
01:46:00,952 --> 01:46:04,488
- Yeah, I heard.
- Hey.

1465
01:46:04,489 --> 01:46:06,857
What's wrong with you?

1466
01:46:06,858 --> 01:46:10,177
You pushed her, didn't you?

1467
01:46:10,178 --> 01:46:13,347
No.

1468
01:46:13,348 --> 01:46:15,833
How can you talk that shit to me?
Julie saw it.

1469
01:46:15,834 --> 01:46:17,702
She couldn't have seen it.

1470
01:46:17,703 --> 01:46:21,205
I saw Julie, and her back was to you.

1471
01:46:25,043 --> 01:46:27,178
She saw it.

1472
01:46:29,915 --> 01:46:32,800
Wow.

1473
01:46:32,801 --> 01:46:34,752
Okay.

1474
01:46:34,753 --> 01:46:37,755
Have fun at your party.

1475
01:46:37,756 --> 01:46:40,157
Molly, Molly!
Come here, Molly!

1476
01:46:40,158 --> 01:46:43,894
You got to come.
Andrew's gonna be there.

1477
01:46:43,895 --> 01:46:46,030
I don't care.

1478
01:46:47,799 --> 01:46:50,868
Molly...

1479
01:46:50,869 --> 01:46:53,838
It ain't a party without you.

1480
01:46:54,973 --> 01:46:59,777
Let go of me.
Let go of me.

1481
01:46:59,778 --> 01:47:01,746

Nomi, think I could
be your understudy?

- Zack.
- How you doing?

1500

Andrew Carver...
Nomi Malone.

You were sensational tonight.

Well, then, let me get you a drink.

<i>Molly.</i>

1546
01:51:57,742 --> 01:51:59,610
We have her sedated.

1547
01:51:59,611 --> 01:52:02,262
She's in shock.

1548
01:52:02,263 --> 01:52:04,698
She has a broken nose,
vaginal tears.

1549
01:52:04,699 --> 01:52:07,868
She'll be here
three or four days.

Zack, Zack...

1551
01:52:38,566 --> 01:52:42,252
Look at this and look at this.

1552
01:52:42,253 --> 01:52:44,154
- Later.
- Where are the police?

1553
01:52:44,155 --> 01:52:46,874
- They're not here.
- Why the fuck aren't they here?

1554
01:52:46,875 --> 01:52:48,826
Because they're not coming.

1555
01:52:51,362 --> 01:52:53,497
<i>Don't do it...</i>

1556
01:52:53,498 --> 01:52:55,265
Polly.

1557
01:53:02,490 --> 01:53:04,425
How did you find out?

1558
01:53:04,426 --> 01:53:07,928
You were busted for disturbing
the peace at the Crave Club.

1559
01:53:07,929 --> 01:53:09,780
The police took
your fingerprints.

1560
01:53:09,781 --> 01:53:12,649
I'm don't have to
listen to this.

1561
01:53:12,650 --> 01:53:16,353
<i>Yes,</i> you do.

1562
01:53:16,354 --> 01:53:19,456
Polly Ann Costello.

1563
01:53:19,457 --> 01:53:22,659
Your father killed your
mother, then killed himself.

1564
01:53:22,660 --> 01:53:25,646
You ran away from a foster home
in Oakland, December 1990.

1565
01:53:25,647 --> 01:53:28,782
- Arrests... Denver, soliciting.
- Stop it!

1566
01:53:28,783 --> 01:53:31,001
San Jose, soliciting.
Cheyenne, soliciting.

1567
01:53:31,002 --> 01:53:35,489
Shall I read the rest of them, huh?
Possession of crack cocaine.

1568
01:53:35,490 --> 01:53:38,559
Assault with a deadly weapon.

1569
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:42,229
Tell me something...
why did you stop hooking?

1570
01:53:42,230 --> 01:53:44,932
You had your future pretty
well mapped out for yourself.

1571
01:53:46,734 --> 01:53:50,170
I did what I had to do.

1572
01:53:50,171 --> 01:53:52,639
Just like you did with Cristal.

1573
01:53:54,242 --> 01:53:57,494
I'm not a whore.

1574
01:53:59,180 --> 01:54:02,850
No, you're not.

1575
01:54:02,851 --> 01:54:07,454
You're gonna be a big star.

1576
01:54:07,455 --> 01:54:10,290
Your face is gonna
be up on billboards.

1577
01:54:10,291 --> 01:54:13,894
And you're gonna make a lot
of money for the Stardust.

1578
01:54:29,310 --> 01:54:32,679
You're not gonna let
them get away with this.

1579
01:54:32,680 --> 01:54:35,199
Andrew Carver is at the
paradiso this year.

1580
01:54:35,200 --> 01:54:38,151
But he might be at the
Riviera next year

1581
01:54:38,152 --> 01:54:41,238
or the Stardust the year after...
he's part of a team. So are you.

1582
01:54:44,292 --> 01:54:46,410
What about Molly?

1583
01:54:46,411 --> 01:54:49,195
You like her? I'll make sure
he gives her enough money.

1584
01:54:49,196 --> 01:54:51,315
She can have a dress shop.

1585
01:54:54,135 --> 01:54:57,137
Tell me something.

1586
01:54:57,138 --> 01:54:59,223
What did you charge?

1587
01:55:01,092 --> 01:55:02,643
Hooking.

1588
01:55:07,148 --> 01:55:09,049
$50.

1589
01:55:09,050 --> 01:55:11,585
$100 sometimes.

1590
01:55:11,586 --> 01:55:14,071
You got low self-esteem, baby.

1591
01:55:14,072 --> 01:55:15,689
You're a fantastic fuck.

1592
01:55:25,583 --> 01:55:28,201
I was paying you a compliment.

1593
01:56:03,104 --> 01:56:05,238
It's showtime.

1594
01:56:18,086 --> 01:56:20,671
Andrew Carver, please.

1595
01:56:26,995 --> 01:56:29,146
- Hello, baby.
- Hi.

1596
01:56:29,147 --> 01:56:32,532
- Lookin' good. He's ready for you.
- Thank you.

1597
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:48,115
Didn't take you long.

1598
01:56:48,116 --> 01:56:50,550
No.

1599
01:56:57,625 --> 01:56:59,710
I like you better topless.

1600
01:57:01,012 --> 01:57:04,097
Wait till you see me bottomless.

1601
01:57:08,936 --> 01:57:10,837
I'm waiting.

1602
01:57:46,107 --> 01:57:48,208
Take the rest off.

1603
01:57:49,811 --> 01:57:51,845
Sure.

1604
01:57:58,920 --> 01:58:01,555
Next time
I'll fucking kill you!

1605
01:58:01,556 --> 01:58:04,191
Okay.
Okay, okay.

1606
01:58:08,096 --> 01:58:09,730
Oh, man, no.

1607
01:58:18,906 --> 01:58:21,541
Fucker!
Fuck off!

1608
01:58:32,053 --> 01:58:34,888
He says he wants to sleep.

1609
01:58:34,889 --> 01:58:37,491
- Tired him out, huh?
- Yeah.

1610
01:58:53,841 --> 01:58:57,144
She's still out.
It's the medication.

1611
01:58:59,113 --> 01:59:01,081
Is she okay?

1612
01:59:01,082 --> 01:59:02,682
She's okay.

1613
01:59:14,028 --> 01:59:17,063
Molly, Molly.

1614
01:59:24,939 --> 01:59:27,941
I just went to Carver.

1615
01:59:27,942 --> 01:59:31,044
I kicked the shit out of him.

1616
01:59:35,783 --> 01:59:38,051
I love you.

1617
01:59:50,064 --> 01:59:52,032
Cristal Connors, please.

1618
01:59:52,033 --> 01:59:53,900
Room 319.

1619
02:00:01,876 --> 02:00:05,879
<i>You know the best advice
I ever gave you?</i>

1620
02:00:05,880 --> 02:00:08,114
If you're the only one
left standing up there...

1621
02:00:08,115 --> 02:00:10,917
They'll hire you.

1622
02:00:10,918 --> 02:00:12,736
Thank you,

1623
02:00:12,737 --> 02:00:15,205
and good night,
ladies and gentlemen.

1624
02:00:15,206 --> 02:00:18,992
Cristal has left the building.

1625
02:00:20,244 --> 02:00:21,828
I'm sorry, Cristal.

1626
02:00:21,829 --> 02:00:25,832
Yeah, I know just
how sorry you are.

1627
02:00:28,302 --> 02:00:32,289
How do you think
I got my first lead?

1628
02:00:33,824 --> 02:00:36,726
There's always someone
younger and hungrier

1629
02:00:36,727 --> 02:00:40,830
coming down the stairs after you.

1630
02:00:40,831 --> 02:00:43,066
Why didn't you tell anyone?

1631
02:00:43,067 --> 02:00:45,735
Oh, hell, darlin'.

1632
02:00:45,736 --> 02:00:48,154
I needed a rest.

1633
02:00:48,155 --> 02:00:52,275
Besides my lawyers got me
a real nice settlement.

1634
02:00:55,546 --> 02:00:58,315
- I gotta go.
- Aren't you gonna come here

1635
02:00:58,316 --> 02:01:00,700
and give me a big kiss?

1636
02:01:39,006 --> 02:01:41,207
Bye, darlin'.

1637
02:01:47,815 --> 02:01:50,050
Bye, darlin'.

1638
02:02:10,471 --> 02:02:13,073
<i>Come on, hurry up!</i>

1639
02:02:21,148 --> 02:02:24,617
Hop in, pard.
This here's your lucky day.

1640
02:02:25,619 --> 02:02:27,887
Right.

1641
02:02:30,491 --> 02:02:32,625
Let's go.

1642
02:02:39,467 --> 02:02:41,518
So did you gamble?

1643
02:02:44,438 --> 02:02:46,389
Did you win?

1644
02:02:49,226 --> 02:02:52,562
What'd you win?

1645
02:02:56,200 --> 02:02:57,734
Me.

1646
02:02:57,735 --> 02:02:59,703
Oh, fuck.

1647
02:02:59,704 --> 02:03:01,204
It's you.

1648
02:03:01,205 --> 02:03:05,291
I want my fucking suitcase...

1649
02:03:05,292 --> 02:03:07,327
- Asshole!
- Hey, wait a minute!

1650
02:03:07,328 --> 02:03:10,163
I'm driving here!
Jesus fuckin' Christ!

1651
02:03:10,164 --> 02:03:12,165
- Watch the fuckin' road!
- Be cool, be cool.

1652
02:03:12,166 --> 02:03:15,034
I'll get your suitcase,
all right?
