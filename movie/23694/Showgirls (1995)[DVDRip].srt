She's great, isn't she?

148

Molly! Cristal needs you

150

Your friend has nice nails

She does them herself

178
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,510
Maybe she can do mine sometime

You can't do that. You're working!

196
00:16:47,604 --> 00:16:49,697

Then what am l doing?

204
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,917

221
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:36,043
l don't need to be taught that

222
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:40,577
Because you're a bad-ass, saying,
''Back off, motherfucker''

223
00:18:40,654 --> 00:18:41,916
You got that down

They want class
They don't want to fuck a Penny

258
00:20:45,682 --> 00:20:49,345
They want to fuck a Heather or a Tiffany

259
00:20:49,652 --> 00:20:51,017
Or a Hope

260
00:20:52,455 --> 00:20:53,752

You talk them into it

272

Fifty bucks a pop,
you do it in the back

273
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,150
Touch and go. They touch, they go

274
00:21:54,586 --> 00:21:56,781
You can touch them
They cannot touch you

275
00:21:58,056 --> 00:21:59,182
That's good

276
00:21:59,524 --> 00:22:01,515
lf they come, that's okay

277
00:22:01,826 --> 00:22:04,387
lf they take it out
and come all over you, call the bouncer

278
00:22:04,463 --> 00:22:07,762
But if he gives you a big tip,
then it's okay

279
00:22:09,602 --> 00:22:11,331
Got that?

280

284
00:22:29,355 --> 00:22:31,653

285
00:22:33,326 --> 00:22:36,762
lf you want to last longer than a week,

286

First l get you used to the money,

340
00:32:11,687 --> 00:32:13,211
You're such a bitch

341

Good night, girls. Get some rest

You burn when you dance

359
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,395
You said l couldn't

360
00:33:30,902 --> 00:33:35,100
You have to learn to hold some in
Dancing ain't fucking

361
00:33:35,407 --> 00:33:37,773
ls that more Wisdom? l know that!

362
00:33:38,143 --> 00:33:41,704

363
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:44,340
What guy? With the chick

364
00:33:44,416 --> 00:33:45,678

You fuck them without fucking them
lt ain't right

You got too much talent!

00:34:29,295 --> 00:34:30,319
Great!

378
00:34:30,997 --> 00:34:33,966
l haven't gotten laid in six months

379
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,632
My right hand's so tired,
l can't thread a needle

380
00:34:36,704 --> 00:34:37,728
Use the left

381
00:34:38,205 --> 00:34:39,604
For threading a needle?

382
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,007
Wow. l like that

l never had a dress like that

389
00:35:12,941 --> 00:35:14,306
lt'll look great on me

390
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,847
Won't it?

391
00:35:26,254 --> 00:35:27,118
What do you think?

392
00:35:27,188 --> 00:35:28,951

496
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:17,407
Pinch them
You want me to do it for you, l'll do it

00:42:31,525 --> 00:42:33,390
Why aren't you erect?

You got me the audition, didn't you?

504
00:43:11,266 --> 00:43:12,358
Why?

505
00:43:14,803 --> 00:43:16,930
Maybe l like the way you dance

506
00:43:18,006 --> 00:43:19,735
Maybe l like you

507
00:43:20,609 --> 00:43:22,270
What difference does it make?

508
00:43:23,979 --> 00:43:26,311
Did you enjoy that out there?

509
00:43:28,116 --> 00:43:30,584
Yeah, darling, l think l did

510
00:43:31,887 --> 00:43:33,479
l hate you

511
00:43:34,823 --> 00:43:36,882
l know

512
00:43:44,634 --> 00:43:49,970
Wipe your nose

513
00:43:59,849 --> 00:44:01,680
The orthodontist convention is
over there!

514
00:44:01,751 --> 00:44:03,981
Realtors come in 20 minutes!

515
00:44:15,966 --> 00:44:17,092
What are you doing here?

516
00:44:17,668 --> 00:44:19,192
l just had an audition

517
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:21,228
You want to be a showgirl?

518
00:44:21,605 --> 00:44:23,698
Smith, what is this?! Move those bags!

519
00:44:25,676 --> 00:44:27,337
Didn't go too good, huh?

520
00:44:29,746 --> 00:44:30,906
l'm glad

521
00:44:31,014 --> 00:44:32,481
Just don't, okay? l'm not in the mood!

522
00:44:32,582 --> 00:44:35,574
Smith, l'm talking to you!

523
00:44:37,521 --> 00:44:39,386
You don't want to be
in this kind of show

524
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:42,724
At least what you do is honest

525
00:44:42,793 --> 00:44:45,193
They want tits and ass,
that's what you give

526
00:44:45,529 --> 00:44:50,160
Here, they pretend they want something
else, you still show tits and ass

527
00:44:50,268 --> 00:44:54,034
You want to work her,
work her on your own time

528
00:44:54,372 --> 00:44:55,600
l'm talking to her

529
00:44:57,709 --> 00:45:01,110
l said l'm talking to her
l'm not working her

530
00:45:01,212 --> 00:45:05,615
You're interrupting me and that's rude
Get the fuck out of here!

531
00:45:06,818 --> 00:45:08,012
Asshole

532
00:45:08,586 --> 00:45:09,644
You're fired!

533
00:45:10,054 --> 00:45:11,749
Take this!

534
00:45:13,624 --> 00:45:15,854
Now look what you did.
You got me fired again

535
00:45:17,061 --> 00:45:19,495
You're a real bad-ass.
You got no shame

536
00:45:20,965 --> 00:45:25,596
Look what a beautiful day it is.
The sun is shining, money's flowing

537
00:45:26,238 --> 00:45:29,730
l'm going to cheer you up.
l'll get you the best meal in town

538
00:45:35,147 --> 00:45:36,409
You like that burger!

539
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:39,678
Where are you from?

540
00:45:40,486 --> 00:45:41,748
Different Places

541
00:45:43,756 --> 00:45:46,657
You like talking about you, huh?

542
00:45:58,705 --> 00:46:00,070
Where are we?
My place

543
00:46:01,374 --> 00:46:02,602
Why?

544
00:46:02,675 --> 00:46:04,006
l want to show you something

545
00:46:11,584 --> 00:46:14,985
Best suite in town
l had to beg and plead to get it

546
00:46:21,294 --> 00:46:22,693
This what you wanted me to see?

547
00:46:23,496 --> 00:46:26,431
What? This nice, big bed here?

548
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:33,069
l wrote this number. lt's about you

549
00:46:33,607 --> 00:46:35,302
You know nothing about me

550
00:46:35,609 --> 00:46:37,406
l know you're a private dancer

551
00:46:39,747 --> 00:46:41,874
l only need three other girls

552
00:46:42,516 --> 00:46:44,848
We can put it on at the Crave Club

553
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:47,453
l'll show you

554
00:46:48,355 --> 00:46:50,516
Stand right here. Watch me

555
00:46:55,329 --> 00:46:58,059
Wait a minute, slow down! Like this?

556
00:47:12,948 --> 00:47:15,781
Follow me. l know you can

00:48:53,818 --> 00:48:55,479
lt's okay, l got towels

562
00:48:59,991 --> 00:49:02,391
You can fuck me when you love me

563
00:49:06,864 --> 00:49:08,388
Then l do love you!

564
00:49:08,733 --> 00:49:09,757
Yeah, right

565
00:49:10,635 --> 00:49:13,468
You don't fool me. l see you

566
00:49:14,205 --> 00:49:15,263
What do you see?

567
00:49:15,607 --> 00:49:17,074
l see you hiding

568
00:49:17,141 --> 00:49:18,130
From what?

569
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:20,644
From you

570
00:49:26,385 --> 00:49:28,580
You got into some bad shit somewhere

571
00:49:28,687 --> 00:49:30,382
Thanks for the hamburger!

572
00:49:36,462 --> 00:49:42,094

She's the yellow rose of Texas,
she charges 50 bucks

577
00:50:13,033 --> 00:50:17,333
She's the richest girl in Texas,
and all she does is fucks!

578
00:50:17,637 --> 00:50:20,401
You're late.

Well, good for her!

She'll be back

586

No, l won't. l'll never come back!

587
00:50:52,773 --> 00:50:54,798
You're a stripper. Don't you get it?

588
00:50:54,875 --> 00:50:56,035
l'm a dancer!

589
00:50:56,277 --> 00:50:59,178

l thought we were working on something

601
00:51:48,498 --> 00:51:50,659
James?

602
00:52:00,543 --> 00:52:02,238
She's in your number?

604

She can't dance

00:52:07,216 --> 00:52:09,150
But you'll teach her, right?

606
00:52:11,021 --> 00:52:13,819
She's got talent, right?

607
00:52:15,592 --> 00:52:17,787
You and me, we ain't got no ties

608
00:52:22,466 --> 00:52:25,458
Dancing ain't fucking. Right?

609
00:52:29,706 --> 00:52:32,675
Yeah...that's right

610
00:52:34,211 --> 00:52:36,145
See ya

611
00:52:45,623 --> 00:52:47,352
Who was that?

612
00:52:48,693 --> 00:52:53,062
Someone who wanted to be in the number

613
00:52:53,765 --> 00:52:56,233
You're not giving her my part,
are you?

614
00:52:56,301 --> 00:52:58,861
Nah, baby. She can't dance

615
00:53:00,371 --> 00:53:02,771
l wrote that number for you,

616
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:12,817
Excuse me

Nomi Malone

Okay. Go on in

620
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,630
One day she looks like Pollyanna

00:53:30,703 --> 00:53:35,072
the next she looks like l don't know,
Lolita

622
00:53:35,774 --> 00:53:36,832
Nice dress

00:53:37,142 --> 00:53:39,406
Thanks. l bought it at Ver-sayce

624
00:53:45,251 --> 00:53:46,445
ln the Forum?

625

Oh, yeah, Ver-sayce. l love Ver-sayce

00:53:51,223 --> 00:53:52,747
Okay, you know Marty

628
00:53:54,294 --> 00:53:55,989
Gay is our line captain

629
00:53:57,697 --> 00:54:03,431
lf you let me down, l'll lose reputation
for being an all-knowing prick

630
00:54:03,503 --> 00:54:07,234
l worked very hard for that reputation,
so don't do it.

631
00:54:07,307 --> 00:54:08,467
Deal?

632
00:54:08,542 --> 00:54:09,440
Deal

633
00:54:09,843 --> 00:54:11,310
Gay will show you around

634
00:54:11,845 --> 00:54:13,005
Let's go

635
00:54:13,813 --> 00:54:16,839
Nomi?
We'll do a run-through this afternoon

636
00:54:17,117 --> 00:54:18,345
Good luck

637
00:54:18,685 --> 00:54:21,711
They tell you that here just
before taking your money

638
00:54:22,789 --> 00:54:25,952
You must maintain your weight
Eat brown rice and vegetables

639
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,462
And stay indoors
Tan lines aren't allowed

640
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:33,596
Make-up and costumes are your
responsibility. Don't take them home

641
00:54:33,968 --> 00:54:37,768
And don't ever,
ever go out onstage crying

642
00:54:38,706 --> 00:54:40,867
You do eat brown rice and vegetables,
don't you?

643
00:54:42,043 --> 00:54:43,237
Good

644
00:54:44,579 --> 00:54:45,910
This is your table

645
00:54:46,447 --> 00:54:49,712
lf you're smart, and l was smart...

646
00:54:50,017 --> 00:54:53,748
you'll figure out a job
and man for later on

647
00:54:54,155 --> 00:54:55,554
How'd you find your guy?

648
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:59,417
l chipped my tooth on a Quaalude
He was my dentist

649
00:54:59,961 --> 00:55:02,692
You'll run this monster 6 times a night

650
00:55:02,798 --> 00:55:05,790
Hold onto the railing.
l'll take you to personnel

651
00:55:06,168 --> 00:55:07,362
They want some information

652
00:55:08,103 --> 00:55:09,331
What kind of information?

653
00:55:10,038 --> 00:55:11,403
Date of birth

654
00:55:11,807 --> 00:55:14,207

655
00:55:16,612 --> 00:55:17,544
Place of birth

656
00:55:19,147 --> 00:55:20,011
New York

657
00:55:20,415 --> 00:55:22,076

You got it! Nice going!

She's pretty memorable. l'm glad

You have a great taste.

This is Nomi!

677

Nicky, Julie, Deena and you know Gay

They'll run through it. You watch

679
00:56:46,037 --> 00:56:47,402
Did you eat?

680
00:56:47,739 --> 00:56:49,263
Jack! What do you want?

681
00:56:50,041 --> 00:56:51,565
Burger, fries and soda

682
00:56:51,643 --> 00:56:54,373
Get her some brown rice,
vegetables and an Evian

683
00:56:55,547 --> 00:56:57,981
No, Nomi, come take a look at this

00:56:59,284 --> 00:57:02,185
Here we go! Five, six, seven, eight!

You try it now. Ready?

686
00:57:13,331 --> 00:57:15,959
Go! Five, six, seven, hit it!

687
00:57:20,005 --> 00:57:21,973
Kick it! Work it!

688
00:57:22,041 --> 00:57:25,033
Hold it!
Nomi, what kind of turn was that?

689
00:57:25,377 --> 00:57:28,039
Do a pique turn. Come on

690
00:57:28,414 --> 00:57:30,143
That's it. Okay, music!

691
00:57:30,916 --> 00:57:33,908
Go! Hah! Go!

692
00:57:36,956 --> 00:57:38,253
Higher

693
00:57:38,324 --> 00:57:39,484
Not that high

694
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:43,027
Stay in sync!

695
00:57:43,629 --> 00:57:45,654
One, two, three, one!

696
00:57:45,965 --> 00:57:48,627
Thrust it! Thrust it!

697
00:57:49,001 --> 00:57:52,301
Thrust it! Come on!

698
00:57:53,607 --> 00:57:54,972
Okay! That's enough. Thank you, ladies

699
00:58:00,213 --> 00:58:01,510
Good job

700
00:58:02,182 --> 00:58:04,582
Work on her turns.
l'm worried about her balance

701
00:58:05,318 --> 00:58:07,183
How long before l can do the show?

702
00:58:07,254 --> 00:58:08,243
You start tonight

703
00:58:10,323 --> 00:58:12,154
Tonight?
You'll be fine

704
00:58:15,662 --> 00:58:16,856
How did she do?

705
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:17,954
She's no butterfly

706
00:58:19,399 --> 00:58:23,836
She's all pelvic thrust. She prowls.
She's got it

707
00:58:23,904 --> 00:58:25,269
l wonder how she got it?

708
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,005
She didn't learn it

709
00:58:27,074 --> 00:58:29,440
She learned it,
but it's not taught in any class

710
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,441
You need more orange. Let me do it

711
00:58:37,185 --> 00:58:38,345
How do you feel?

712
00:58:39,086 --> 00:58:40,553
Don't ask. Don't ask!

713
00:58:41,389 --> 00:58:42,549
Who took my make-up?

714
00:58:42,623 --> 00:58:44,955
Monkey alert! Monkey alert!

715
00:58:48,663 --> 00:58:50,597
Damn it, Hector! l told you!

716
00:58:50,865 --> 00:58:52,833
They get the heat! They make babies!

717
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:53,924
Babies?

718
00:58:55,603 --> 00:58:56,501
Oh, get it out

719
00:58:56,838 --> 00:58:57,805
Watch it

720
00:59:00,676 --> 00:59:02,644
Go! Go!
Grab her!

721
00:59:03,111 --> 00:59:04,772
Hey! l got one!

722
00:59:06,348 --> 00:59:07,474
The rest are upstairs

723
00:59:07,549 --> 00:59:10,484
Julie, you slut,

724
00:59:10,552 --> 00:59:13,146
l'm a slut?
You fucked that pizza place kid!

725
00:59:13,222 --> 00:59:14,348
You fucked the meter reader!

726
00:59:14,656 --> 00:59:17,022
Bitch!
You're fucking dead!

727
00:59:19,328 --> 00:59:21,353
Jesus, Annie, get off her!

728
00:59:21,763 --> 00:59:23,697
Julie! Calm down! Stop it!

729
00:59:24,233 --> 00:59:26,633
Now settle down! lt's done!

730
00:59:29,471 --> 00:59:30,768

You're fine. Let's move up, you guys!

There's shit on the stage

They always shit. lt's that garlic

736

Upstage left, monkey shit. Let's go!

Last chance for ice

00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:58,997
Let's go!

741
01:00:05,041 --> 01:00:08,011

<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the

Good luck. Love, Zack Carey

750
01:02:28,789 --> 01:02:31,587
Nomi. Slip this on

751
01:02:32,159 --> 01:02:33,921
Did l do okay?
You did fine

752
01:02:34,794 --> 01:02:39,754
Your leg extension needs work. Someone

753
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:41,192
Put this on. You're done

754

You nearly fell

755
01:02:50,609 --> 01:02:51,667
Hey, yo!

Come on, please?

758
01:02:57,449 --> 01:02:58,312
Talk

759
01:02:58,850 --> 01:02:59,874
Alone?

760
01:03:01,185 --> 01:03:03,085
l'll get the car.
Be right there

761
01:03:07,892 --> 01:03:09,052
Who sent you the flowers?

762
01:03:11,428 --> 01:03:12,656
None of your business

763
01:03:13,730 --> 01:03:16,528
Okay. l just wanted to say...

764
01:03:16,633 --> 01:03:18,328
You and me ain't got no ties

765
01:03:23,906 --> 01:03:25,840
l have a problem with pussy

766
01:03:26,342 --> 01:03:29,038
l always have, and l always will

767
01:03:29,378 --> 01:03:30,504
But l meant what l said

768
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:34,573
l don't care about your problems.
l did write it for you

769
01:03:36,352 --> 01:03:39,718
But l did tell her l would teach her,
and l did fuck her

770
01:03:40,388 --> 01:03:43,414
Who you fuck is your business
l won't make it mine

771
01:03:45,327 --> 01:03:48,694
lt's not like l'm seeing any money
for writing that number

772
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:52,321
l may as well touch a little pussy

773
01:03:54,969 --> 01:03:56,937
You got nothing to say

774
01:03:57,705 --> 01:03:59,070
No

775
01:04:00,207 --> 01:04:01,673
Thanks for the flowers!

776
01:04:02,608 --> 01:04:04,166
Tony said you did great!

777
01:04:05,077 --> 01:04:06,874
l never got flowers before

778
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,878
l'm sure you'll get lots of them

779
01:04:13,085 --> 01:04:14,347
He gave them to you?

780
01:04:15,419 --> 01:04:16,613
Yeah, he did

781
01:04:17,388 --> 01:04:19,481
What is he? A pimp?

782
01:04:19,957 --> 01:04:22,391
Only people with pimp cars are pimps

783
01:04:22,927 --> 01:04:25,225
He's the entertainment director

784
01:04:25,296 --> 01:04:27,161
That's what l said. He's a pimp!

785
01:04:27,531 --> 01:04:28,690
Let's go!

786
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:34,169
Good luck with your number

01:04:58,626 --> 01:05:00,355
Hello?

788
01:05:02,864 --> 01:05:04,491
Anybody here?

789
01:05:04,565 --> 01:05:06,157
Back here

790
01:05:08,035 --> 01:05:09,764
What are you doing here?

791
01:05:10,070 --> 01:05:12,368
What am l doing here?

792
01:05:13,774 --> 01:05:18,006
Doing some of the finest cocaine
in the world. Want some?

793
01:05:23,015 --> 01:05:25,176
lt's great for the muscles

794
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:31,255
l told Marty
l'd work on turns with you...

795
01:05:31,323 --> 01:05:33,950
but l'm feeling a little inside-out

796
01:05:34,292 --> 01:05:35,725
Cut the shit

797
01:05:36,127 --> 01:05:37,185
Okay

798
01:05:38,296 --> 01:05:41,197
We got off on the wrong foot

799
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:43,959
Want to start dancing all over again?

800
01:05:45,002 --> 01:05:46,936
Why?

801
01:05:47,004 --> 01:05:48,528
Why not?

802
01:05:50,441 --> 01:05:52,739
Want to go eat at Spago?

803
01:05:52,810 --> 01:05:53,936
Where is it?

804
01:05:54,244 --> 01:05:55,677
Just down from Ver-sayce

806
01:05:57,847 --> 01:06:00,839
Ahh, right. Versace

l'll have brown rice and vegetables

811
01:06:28,542 --> 01:06:31,306
Do you like brown rice and vegetables?

812
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:34,242
You do?

813
01:06:35,216 --> 01:06:36,443
Sort of

814
01:06:37,517 --> 01:06:38,916
Really?

815
01:06:42,021 --> 01:06:44,216
lt's worse than dog food

816
01:06:44,791 --> 01:06:45,883
lt is

817
01:06:48,361 --> 01:06:50,726
l've had dog food

818
01:06:52,231 --> 01:06:53,630
You have?

819
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:56,895
A long time ago

820
01:06:57,903 --> 01:06:59,837
Doggy chow

821
01:07:01,006 --> 01:07:03,371
l used to love Doggy Chow

822
01:07:04,008 --> 01:07:06,476
l used to love Doggy Chow, too

823
01:07:19,255 --> 01:07:21,155
l got a headache from champagne

824
01:07:21,557 --> 01:07:23,889
This isn't champagne

825
01:07:24,894 --> 01:07:28,226
This is holy water

826
01:07:29,330 --> 01:07:31,662
l named myself after this holy water

827
01:07:32,133 --> 01:07:35,796
Chrissie Lou Connors had
dingy brown hair and little tits

828
01:07:36,704 --> 01:07:40,571
lt's amazing what paint
and a surgeon can do

829
01:07:48,916 --> 01:07:50,713
You have great tits

830
01:07:51,485 --> 01:07:53,384
They're beautiful

831
01:07:54,187 --> 01:07:55,449
Thank you

832
01:07:56,889 --> 01:07:58,754
l like nice tits

833
01:07:59,792 --> 01:08:02,022
l always have. What about you?

834
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:05,229
l like having nice tits

835
01:08:06,398 --> 01:08:08,628
How do you like having them?

836
01:08:12,938 --> 01:08:14,428
What do you mean?

837
01:08:15,507 --> 01:08:17,907
You know what l mean

838
01:08:21,812 --> 01:08:24,576
l like having them in a nice dress...

839
01:08:24,949 --> 01:08:26,780
or a tight top

840
01:08:29,386 --> 01:08:32,013
You like to show them off

841
01:08:34,224 --> 01:08:36,692
l didn't like showing them
at the Cheetah

842
01:08:37,227 --> 01:08:38,854
Why not?

843
01:08:39,229 --> 01:08:43,529
l liked looking at them there.
Everybody did

844
01:08:44,299 --> 01:08:45,960
lt made me feel like a hooker

845
01:08:46,335 --> 01:08:47,962
You are a whore, darling

846
01:08:48,036 --> 01:08:49,435
l'm not!

847
01:08:49,504 --> 01:08:50,937
We all are

848
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:56,107
We take the cash, we cash the check,
we show them what they want to see

849
01:08:56,178 --> 01:08:58,907
Maybe you're a whore, but l'm not

850
01:09:02,083 --> 01:09:04,415
You and me...

851
01:09:04,518 --> 01:09:08,010
we're exactly alike

852
01:09:16,129 --> 01:09:18,495
l'll never be like you

853
01:09:23,068 --> 01:09:27,266
Miss Connors! Sorry to bother you
Would you sign this for me?

854
01:09:27,339 --> 01:09:29,500
Happy to. What's your name?

855
01:09:29,575 --> 01:09:31,907
Frank. l'm from Galveston

856
01:09:32,444 --> 01:09:35,004
l'm from Del Rio myself, Frank

857
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:38,173
l told you she was from Texas.
Whoo-ee, look at that!

858
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:40,642
Could l have one like that?

859
01:09:41,019 --> 01:09:43,817
You want a girl to use up
all her lipstick on you?

860
01:09:44,622 --> 01:09:47,090
Want to dance?
Right now?

861
01:09:47,458 --> 01:09:50,085
lt's now or never.
That's what Elvis said

862
01:09:54,464 --> 01:09:57,331
You know the best advice l ever got?

863
01:09:57,401 --> 01:10:01,166
You're up there onstage,
hoping on a spot

864
01:10:01,537 --> 01:10:04,870
lf someone gets in your way,
step on them

865
01:10:05,408 --> 01:10:09,401
lf you're the only one left
standing there, they hire you

866
01:10:10,112 --> 01:10:12,774
That's about it.
Thank you and good night

867
01:10:12,882 --> 01:10:15,782
Elvis has left the building

868
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:24,070
You see, darling...

869
01:11:24,179 --> 01:11:26,113
you are a whore

870
01:11:29,084 --> 01:11:30,551
Bitch!

871
01:11:35,590 --> 01:11:37,717
Guess we're done

872
01:11:49,770 --> 01:11:51,533
Nicky, can l talk to you for a second?

873
01:11:59,478 --> 01:12:01,946
Mommy, can we see the monkeys?
Not now

874
01:12:02,314 --> 01:12:05,418
Please. They're so cute.
They have to work

875
01:12:05,418 --> 01:12:06,851
What are they doing?

876
01:12:06,919 --> 01:12:09,046
l want to see the monkeys!
Not now

877
01:12:09,121 --> 01:12:10,519
Why not?

878
01:12:10,588 --> 01:12:12,579
Get these fucking kids out of here

879
01:12:13,525 --> 01:12:16,323
You said the F'' word!
She said the ''F'' word''

880
01:12:16,694 --> 01:12:17,888
She said the F'' word!''

881
01:12:17,962 --> 01:12:19,589
Shut the fuck up!

882
01:12:27,371 --> 01:12:28,998
lt's okay. lt's okay

883
01:12:30,774 --> 01:12:34,710
Nomi, a boat convention's coming
into town next week

884
01:12:34,812 --> 01:12:36,946
They need two girls. Nicky's doing it

885
01:12:36,946 --> 01:12:39,278
You interested? lt pays $1,000

886
01:12:41,884 --> 01:12:44,785
A thousand dollars? To do what?

887
01:12:45,121 --> 01:12:49,648
Represent the hotel. You wear your
costume, smile, they take your picture

888
01:12:50,926 --> 01:12:52,291
A thousand dollars?

889
01:12:56,364 --> 01:12:59,390
Great. Cristal here recommended you

890
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:03,800
Thanks

891
01:13:04,205 --> 01:13:07,971
My pleasure, darling.
Just looking out for you

892
01:13:08,242 --> 01:13:11,143
Cristal, about the magazine layout...?
Later

893
01:13:11,212 --> 01:13:12,440
Don't do it

894
01:13:13,314 --> 01:13:14,837
lt's $1,000. Why not?

895
01:13:14,948 --> 01:13:16,006
Molly, l need you!

896
01:13:16,082 --> 01:13:19,518
l'm coming.
l know girls who did it and they...

897
01:13:19,586 --> 01:13:21,520
Molly, l'm waiting

898
01:13:22,856 --> 01:13:24,255
They didn't like it

899
01:13:30,661 --> 01:13:32,253
Did you do it before?

900
01:13:32,930 --> 01:13:33,919
Did you like it?

901
01:13:34,432 --> 01:13:37,333
Did l like it? Sure, l liked it

902
01:14:03,726 --> 01:14:09,220
Let's thank these 2 beautiful girls from
Goddess'', a new smash at the Stardust''

903
01:14:15,403 --> 01:14:16,734
Shit

904
01:14:16,804 --> 01:14:18,906
How's it going?
Fine

905
01:14:18,906 --> 01:14:20,305
Tough gig, huh?

906
01:14:20,374 --> 01:14:21,500
Very

907
01:14:22,042 --> 01:14:24,875
This is my good friend,
Mr. Okida, from Bangkok

908
01:14:25,445 --> 01:14:28,972
He's one of our very, very high rollers

909
01:14:29,082 --> 01:14:32,517
Ladies, we want to take you to dinner
after the show

910
01:14:32,585 --> 01:14:35,554
Have some lobster, hear Caesar sing

911
01:14:35,621 --> 01:14:39,557
You ever heard Caesar sing?
The guy's great. You'll love him

912
01:14:40,293 --> 01:14:41,419
Caesar sing?

913
01:14:41,827 --> 01:14:45,262
Then we'll go back to my place
and we'll sing

914
01:14:45,797 --> 01:14:47,059
Just the four of us

915
01:14:48,099 --> 01:14:49,327
How about it?

916
01:14:52,804 --> 01:14:54,795
We sing

917
01:14:56,874 --> 01:14:59,968
Yeah, we'll sing a lot of songs

918
01:15:02,947 --> 01:15:03,936
Okay

919
01:15:04,215 --> 01:15:05,773
Good deal

920
01:15:05,849 --> 01:15:09,079
Okay. Good deal

921
01:15:11,321 --> 01:15:13,312
Not me

922
01:15:18,328 --> 01:15:20,592
Be nice.
Let go of me!

923
01:15:20,897 --> 01:15:22,454
You got $1,000 for this

924
01:15:22,531 --> 01:15:25,022
Yeah, for this! This!

925
01:15:25,467 --> 01:15:27,025
Oh, forget it

926
01:15:27,269 --> 01:15:30,534
Just forget it! No harm done!
No damage!

927
01:15:30,606 --> 01:15:31,800
Christ!

928
01:15:39,780 --> 01:15:40,769
Zack?

929
01:15:41,983 --> 01:15:43,245
l want to talk to you

930
01:15:44,885 --> 01:15:48,752
Let's go upstairs

931
01:15:49,389 --> 01:15:50,913
Have a nice day, darling?

932
01:15:53,059 --> 01:15:54,185
No

933
01:15:57,097 --> 01:15:59,156
l'm sorry to hear that

934
01:16:02,134 --> 01:16:03,567
Jesus

935
01:16:06,972 --> 01:16:10,703
l'm sorry.
Some people just don't get it

936
01:16:12,611 --> 01:16:15,773
l'm on the stage. Get me Phil

937
01:16:17,081 --> 01:16:18,048
Thank you

938
01:16:18,449 --> 01:16:19,939
Stay

939
01:16:23,488 --> 01:16:25,456
The drop is up 33% on those machines

940
01:16:25,556 --> 01:16:28,854
lt will make your bottom line about 250

941
01:16:32,596 --> 01:16:34,496
l got an MBA for this

942
01:16:35,098 --> 01:16:39,692
That's what this business is now
cost analyzing slot machines

943
01:16:40,201 --> 01:16:42,169
What's an MBA?

944
01:16:43,805 --> 01:16:45,602
Zack, you in here?

945
01:16:46,775 --> 01:16:47,799
Excuse me

946
01:16:48,943 --> 01:16:51,536
Hey! What's going on?

947
01:16:51,645 --> 01:16:53,670
You do anything like this again,
you're fired

948
01:16:54,181 --> 01:16:56,376
Nothing happened.
Something did!

949
01:16:56,817 --> 01:16:58,444
She jumped to conclusions

950
01:16:58,585 --> 01:17:03,284
lt happens again,
you'll jump to your conclusion

951
01:17:03,624 --> 01:17:05,523
Without your golden parachute

952
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:08,855
You owe her an apology

953
01:17:12,532 --> 01:17:15,092
Nomi, l'm sorry. l apologize

954
01:17:15,802 --> 01:17:17,200
Yeah, fine. Okay

955
01:17:20,505 --> 01:17:21,802
Get out

956
01:17:24,910 --> 01:17:29,643
An MBA is a college degree.
lt's mostly worthless in the real world

957
01:17:33,017 --> 01:17:34,609
You go for it, don't you?

958
01:17:35,753 --> 01:17:37,948
Yeah, l try to

959
01:17:41,292 --> 01:17:42,918
Showtime

960
01:17:43,593 --> 01:17:45,026
That's for sure

961
01:17:55,038 --> 01:17:57,335
Phil, you dumb fuck, get back up here

962
01:17:58,874 --> 01:18:00,307
l know, l know

963
01:18:09,283 --> 01:18:13,913
Thank you for looking out for me.
You were so nice to recommend me to Phil

964
01:18:14,389 --> 01:18:16,016
What are friends for?

965
01:18:17,525 --> 01:18:18,651
Right

966
01:18:25,599 --> 01:18:27,590
You were right about the convention

967
01:18:29,002 --> 01:18:30,162
Sweet baby!

968
01:18:31,405 --> 01:18:33,873
Do that again, l'll break your fingers!

969
01:18:33,939 --> 01:18:36,567
Not my fault
you don't have a gay partner

970
01:18:36,675 --> 01:18:37,699
Fuck you

971
01:18:37,810 --> 01:18:40,779
He wants everyone to see
how hetero he is

972
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:43,610
Molly, bring that flashlight
so l can see how big it is

973
01:18:43,983 --> 01:18:46,008
You want a knuckle sandwich?

974
01:18:46,352 --> 01:18:48,615
Can l have mine anally, please?

975
01:18:48,686 --> 01:18:50,620
Come on, you guys! Jesus!

976
01:18:50,688 --> 01:18:52,417
Let's go! Let's line it up!

977
01:18:53,158 --> 01:18:54,489
What you looking at, bitch?

978
01:18:54,826 --> 01:18:57,624
Okay, let's go. Move it! Go, go, go!

979
01:19:36,364 --> 01:19:37,661
Oh, my God

980
01:20:05,289 --> 01:20:07,052
Are you okay, Annie?

981
01:20:26,710 --> 01:20:28,177
lt's my leg

982
01:20:28,245 --> 01:20:29,609
Tell me when it hurts

983
01:20:31,614 --> 01:20:32,603
lt's her knee

984
01:20:33,048 --> 01:20:34,208
lt isn't broken, is it?

985
01:20:34,783 --> 01:20:36,250
Daryl, what happened?

986
01:20:36,652 --> 01:20:38,210
My foot went out from under me

987
01:20:40,456 --> 01:20:42,320
This is what happened

988
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:47,389
l wonder how those got up here?

989
01:20:48,029 --> 01:20:49,860
Probably came off a costume

990
01:20:50,231 --> 01:20:52,096
We'll get you to the hospital

991
01:20:52,166 --> 01:20:53,463
Shit, no!

992
01:20:53,535 --> 01:20:56,970
Jesus. Poor Annie. Tough break

993
01:20:57,337 --> 01:20:58,361
Let us through here

994
01:21:02,943 --> 01:21:04,103
See you later

995
01:21:05,812 --> 01:21:06,801
l'm the producer

996
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:09,507
l hired you! You do what l say

997
01:21:09,582 --> 01:21:12,244
She was my understudy.
l have a say, too

998
01:21:12,318 --> 01:21:14,854
Yeah, but guess who makes the decision

999
01:21:14,854 --> 01:21:16,219
lt's broken, kids

1000
01:21:16,822 --> 01:21:19,659
Shit. That will be three months

1001
01:21:19,659 --> 01:21:20,455
At least

1002
01:21:23,228 --> 01:21:24,593
Bad karma, huh?

1003
01:21:24,896 --> 01:21:26,693
Nomi, your mother's waiting for you

1004
01:21:27,666 --> 01:21:28,963
My mother?

1005
01:21:29,501 --> 01:21:32,698
For your sake, l hope she's not

1006
01:21:34,672 --> 01:21:36,936
lf a light sleeper sleeps with
a light on

1007
01:21:37,007 --> 01:21:39,032
Can a hard sleeper sleep with
a hard on?

1008
01:21:39,343 --> 01:21:43,473
What do you call a tiger?
A big pussy that eats people

1009
01:21:43,547 --> 01:21:44,639
Henry!

1010
01:21:47,784 --> 01:21:50,582
l can get shit on,
but l don't like getting spit on

1011
01:21:53,423 --> 01:21:54,583
Hi, Al

1012
01:21:55,458 --> 01:21:56,652
You look like shit

1013
01:21:57,327 --> 01:22:00,193
She looks better than a 10-inch dick
and you know it

1014
01:22:01,863 --> 01:22:04,764
So...do you like it here?

1015
01:22:04,833 --> 01:22:06,198
What, you think she misses you?

1016
01:22:06,868 --> 01:22:08,301
Yeah, why not?

1017
01:22:08,837 --> 01:22:10,236
We miss her

1018
01:22:10,339 --> 01:22:14,604
She misses us like that lump on my twat
l had taken off last week

1019
01:22:14,675 --> 01:22:15,903
Jesus, Henry

1020
01:22:24,085 --> 01:22:25,483
We saw the show

1021
01:22:27,153 --> 01:22:28,586
You were good

1022
01:22:30,824 --> 01:22:32,155
Thank you, Al

1023
01:22:36,963 --> 01:22:38,896
Real good

1024
01:22:42,334 --> 01:22:44,700
You take care, kid

1025
01:22:49,908 --> 01:22:53,967
Must be weird,
not having anyone come on you

1026
01:22:59,116 --> 01:23:01,983
Nomi. Hey, you want a ride?

1027
01:23:04,553 --> 01:23:05,542
l got one

1028
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:11,387

01:23:17,098 --> 01:23:17,928
No

1032
01:23:18,867 --> 01:23:20,266

1033
01:23:22,537 --> 01:23:24,971
lt's some car, huh?
lt doesn't suck

1034

Where are we headed? Give me directions

1035

Do you like Cristal?

1037
01:23:54,367 --> 01:23:56,459
l like a lot of different champagnes

1038

But l always drink champagne

There's an audition at noon.
You want to try?

1052
01:27:59,024 --> 01:28:01,891
Would you have told me
if l hadn't come here?

1053
01:28:02,260 --> 01:28:05,252
lt was your idea to come here, not mine

l want to see you again

1055
01:28:13,270 --> 01:28:14,828
We'll see how it goes

1056

l hate you

1060
01:28:47,836 --> 01:28:50,099
Who was he?
Zack

1061
01:28:50,438 --> 01:28:52,303
Oh, my God

1062
01:28:52,907 --> 01:28:54,272
Did you tie him up?

1063
01:28:54,709 --> 01:28:55,733
Oh, shit

1064
01:28:56,711 --> 01:28:58,372
l forgot to untie him

1065
01:29:03,049 --> 01:29:04,311
Are you high?

1066
01:29:04,751 --> 01:29:06,480
Maybe a little

1067
01:29:08,388 --> 01:29:12,790
l can't go to sleep. l have an audition
at noon. Where are the Sugar Snaps?

1068
01:29:13,158 --> 01:29:15,421
ln the cupboard. Nomi...

1069
01:29:15,827 --> 01:29:17,852
don't get sucked into it

1070
01:29:20,598 --> 01:29:22,156
Look what l found!

1071
01:29:24,969 --> 01:29:26,664
Okay, whatever, Nomes

Julie

1073
01:29:58,767 --> 01:30:01,600
She's not hot enough.
She has it down

1074
01:30:01,803 --> 01:30:05,432
You can teach it.
She doesn't have Cristal's heat

1075
01:30:05,774 --> 01:30:07,832
None of them have Cristal's heat

1076
01:30:08,575 --> 01:30:10,304
l do love you, Gay

1077
01:30:10,778 --> 01:30:12,177
Nomi has heat

1078
01:30:13,781 --> 01:30:14,873
Does she know?

1079
01:30:15,949 --> 01:30:17,246
Yes, she does

1080
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:20,810
ln a totally different way

1081
01:30:21,254 --> 01:30:24,018
Come on! She's going to take the lead?

1082
01:30:24,390 --> 01:30:27,154
This a hotel show!
lt's not the Cheetah!

1083
01:30:27,493 --> 01:30:30,860
lt doesn't matter
l haven't missed a show in 8 years

1084
01:30:31,230 --> 01:30:33,220
You're not getting any younger

1085
01:30:33,398 --> 01:30:34,626
Eat me

1086
01:30:35,367 --> 01:30:37,335
Want to see it again with just Nomi?
No

1087
01:30:37,836 --> 01:30:39,770
l do. Set it up, Marty

1088
01:30:39,838 --> 01:30:41,135
This is bullshit

1089
01:30:41,873 --> 01:30:43,363
lt's about your dick

1090
01:30:43,742 --> 01:30:44,969
Nicky, Julie, thank you!

1091
01:30:45,976 --> 01:30:47,204
What do we know about her?

1092
01:30:47,311 --> 01:30:50,212
Nothing. l doubt her
Social Security number's right

1093
01:30:50,281 --> 01:30:51,748
Find out.
What?

1094
01:30:51,816 --> 01:30:52,908
Everything

1095
01:31:07,497 --> 01:31:09,226
You fucked her, didn't you?

1096
01:31:09,799 --> 01:31:14,201
Are you pissed off
because you're jealous?

1097
01:31:14,269 --> 01:31:16,328
Or because l beat you to the punch?

1098
01:31:37,591 --> 01:31:41,391
You fuck him for the spot
or because you wanted to?

1099
01:31:44,397 --> 01:31:46,763
l say you did it for the spot

1100
01:31:47,334 --> 01:31:49,995
ls that what you did, Cristal?

1101
01:31:50,603 --> 01:31:54,061
You don't want to piss me off,
now that we're friends

1102
01:31:54,607 --> 01:31:57,576
No, you shouldn't get pissed off

1103
01:31:57,877 --> 01:31:59,344
lt makes you look older

1104
01:32:05,083 --> 01:32:08,917
You got it

1105
01:32:09,754 --> 01:32:11,119
l do?

1106
01:32:12,257 --> 01:32:13,918
Marty and Gay will work with you

1107
01:32:14,325 --> 01:32:17,657
Phil will have some glossies taken.
You did good

1108
01:32:18,762 --> 01:32:21,161
l'll call you for dinner, lobster

1109
01:32:21,531 --> 01:32:24,227
Did you ever hear Caesar sing?
You'll love it

1110
01:32:35,210 --> 01:32:36,734
What?

1111
01:32:38,413 --> 01:32:41,973
Congratulations.
l see you have many talents

1112
01:32:42,850 --> 01:32:44,681

l didn't know about the audition

1115
01:33:13,779 --> 01:33:15,940
Do you like my nails?

1116
01:33:27,625 --> 01:33:29,820
They're not as nice as yours

1117

What are friends for?

1121
01:34:00,221 --> 01:34:02,121
On second thought...

1122
01:34:03,925 --> 01:34:06,723
maybe you shouldn't do mine

1123
01:34:08,162 --> 01:34:12,097
l'm getting too old for that whory look

1124
01:34:13,267 --> 01:34:15,201
l'll think about it

You suck!

1129
01:35:28,536 --> 01:35:30,093
Get off the stage!

1130
01:35:31,071 --> 01:35:33,471
Enough of this stuff!

1131
01:35:33,873 --> 01:35:35,602
Let's dance!

1132

l loved it! lt was good

1133
01:35:50,255 --> 01:35:52,189
What are you doing here, slumming?

1134
01:35:52,257 --> 01:35:53,621
Heather!

1135
01:35:55,460 --> 01:35:56,427
Were we good?

1136
01:35:56,527 --> 01:35:57,425
Great

1137
01:35:57,762 --> 01:35:59,059
She dances like a truck!

1138
01:35:59,831 --> 01:36:03,334
l do not! Do you want something to drink?

1139
01:36:03,334 --> 01:36:04,699
Yeah. Get me a beer, bitch

1140
01:36:06,770 --> 01:36:08,237
Look what l got

1141

lt's beautiful

1142

l stole it from my grandmother

1143
01:36:14,311 --> 01:36:17,337
You did not! You got it at a pawnshop

1144
01:36:26,255 --> 01:36:27,688
We're getting married

1145
01:36:30,859 --> 01:36:32,053
You love her?

1146
01:36:33,361 --> 01:36:36,023
l don't know. She's having a baby

1147
01:36:40,869 --> 01:36:42,029
And this?

1148
01:36:43,171 --> 01:36:47,630
We ain't any good. You heard them.
''Get off the stage!''

1149
01:36:49,610 --> 01:36:50,702
What will you do?

1150
01:36:52,613 --> 01:36:56,310
Work in a grocery store
Her mother owns it

1151
01:36:57,283 --> 01:37:00,343
We'll get a discount on baby food

1152
01:37:11,696 --> 01:37:12,958
See ya

1153
01:37:16,835 --> 01:37:21,795
Shit happens, you know? Life sucks.
l'm a student of T-shirts!

1154
01:37:33,050 --> 01:37:34,517
Hey, Nicky

1155
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:45,125
Dear Ms. Malone,

1156
01:37:45,228 --> 01:37:49,527
We regret we are unable to
offer you...understudy

1157
01:38:02,176 --> 01:38:03,444
You can't go in there!

1158
01:38:03,444 --> 01:38:04,342
What's going on?

1159
01:38:04,745 --> 01:38:06,144
What's going on?!

1160
01:38:06,214 --> 01:38:08,546
Hey, cool it.
Cool it?!

1161
01:38:09,617 --> 01:38:11,244
When you sent me this?!

1162
01:38:11,319 --> 01:38:14,151
She threatened to walk!
She got her lawyers into it!

1163
01:38:14,221 --> 01:38:15,279
So what?!

1164
01:38:15,355 --> 01:38:17,653
So, she's a star! You're not worth it

1165
01:38:19,259 --> 01:38:21,090
Sorry, Nomi. l tried. Fuck!

1166
01:38:23,797 --> 01:38:28,495
Basically, my G-string snapped. There
l was, dancing butt naked for 5 mins

1167
01:38:28,868 --> 01:38:30,460
l mean, my poor partner!

1168
01:38:33,205 --> 01:38:35,867
l thought about it, darling

1169
01:38:37,709 --> 01:38:39,699
Think you could do my nails now?

1170
01:38:46,116 --> 01:38:47,344
Okay

1171
01:38:47,684 --> 01:38:49,276
Maybe some other time

1172
01:41:00,906 --> 01:41:04,342
Come on...slave girl

1173
01:41:08,147 --> 01:41:09,910
We've got five minutes. Go!

1174
01:41:12,118 --> 01:41:17,145
Go, you guys! Run, run!

1175
01:41:23,595 --> 01:41:24,994
Let me through!

1176
01:41:26,563 --> 01:41:27,791
Shit!

1177
01:41:29,099 --> 01:41:30,566
Cristal, can you hear me?

1178
01:41:31,502 --> 01:41:33,367
Somebody get Marty!

1179
01:41:38,375 --> 01:41:39,602
What happened?
l don't know

1180
01:41:40,543 --> 01:41:41,908
Somebody get an ambulance!

1181
01:41:42,512 --> 01:41:43,774
Who was behind her?

1182
01:41:44,213 --> 01:41:45,009
l was

1183
01:41:46,082 --> 01:41:47,048
What happened?

1184
01:41:48,583 --> 01:41:51,143
l don't know. She just went down

1185
01:41:52,253 --> 01:41:54,744
She slipped. l saw it

1186
01:41:56,657 --> 01:41:58,818
Nomi wasn't even close to her

1187
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:17,872
Tough break, huh?

1188
01:42:21,146 --> 01:42:22,204
What's wrong?

1189
01:42:22,581 --> 01:42:23,843
Nothing

1190
01:42:44,234 --> 01:42:46,862
Thanks. Keep me informed

1191
01:42:48,105 --> 01:42:51,006
She has a concussion.
That'll be all right

1192
01:42:51,374 --> 01:42:53,774
But she has a compound fracture
of the hip

1193
01:42:54,478 --> 01:42:56,445
Those take forever to heal

1194
01:42:57,847 --> 01:42:59,109
We have to shut down

1195
01:42:59,515 --> 01:43:02,450
Not a chance. The show goes on

1196
01:43:02,918 --> 01:43:06,251
The Stardust is never dark.
lt has never been

1197
01:43:06,655 --> 01:43:09,122
lt never will be. Not while l am alive

1198
01:43:10,492 --> 01:43:11,754
Who was her understudy?

1199
01:43:12,961 --> 01:43:14,553
We had a girl who...

1200
01:43:15,597 --> 01:43:16,859
What's funny?

1201
01:43:16,931 --> 01:43:21,128
Cristal Connors is a star, Sam!
You can't just replace her

1202
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:29,471
We could bring someone in
while she's out

1203
01:43:29,543 --> 01:43:30,908
She could be out for a year

1204
01:43:30,978 --> 01:43:32,172
Like who?

1205
01:43:32,546 --> 01:43:34,672
Janet Jackson. Paula Abdul

1206
01:43:34,781 --> 01:43:36,248
Paula Abdul? ln my show?

1207
01:43:36,315 --> 01:43:39,307
We're not paying
those kind of salaries

1208
01:43:39,418 --> 01:43:43,411
ln that case, Mr. Karlman,
we do what we do in Vegas

1209
01:43:45,191 --> 01:43:46,782
We gamble

1210
01:43:49,594 --> 01:43:51,357
Ladies and gentlemen...

1211
01:43:51,429 --> 01:43:56,389
the Stardust proudly presents
Miss Nomi Malone

1212
01:45:03,095 --> 01:45:04,891
We could have hired anyone

1213
01:45:04,996 --> 01:45:07,021
Janet Jackson, Paula Abdul

1214
01:45:07,465 --> 01:45:11,333
Nomi Malone is
what Las Vegas is all about

1215
01:45:11,402 --> 01:45:13,893
She's dazzling, she's exciting...

1216
01:45:14,005 --> 01:45:17,531
...and very, very sexy.
Thank you, Zack

1217
01:45:18,442 --> 01:45:20,171
How did you feel about
the show tonight?

1218
01:45:21,979 --> 01:45:24,413
l hope l can be as good as the show

1219
01:45:24,481 --> 01:45:28,884
You are, my dear. You are the show

1220
01:45:31,754 --> 01:45:33,551
Good one. Over here, Nomi

1221
01:45:33,923 --> 01:45:37,051
One more, Nomi! Please, please

1222
01:45:40,930 --> 01:45:42,362
Hey, you ready to party?

1223
01:45:43,164 --> 01:45:45,997
Where?
The Paradiso. l rented the bungalows

1224
01:45:46,101 --> 01:45:47,659
For what?
For you

1225
01:45:51,239 --> 01:45:53,366
Hurry. l got a limo waiting

1226
01:45:53,475 --> 01:45:55,942
l don't have anything to wear!
Yes, you do

1227
01:45:56,777 --> 01:46:00,213
Andrew Carvers' coming
He saw the show and thinks you're great

1228
01:46:01,482 --> 01:46:04,542
Did you hear?
Andrew Carver will be there!

1229
01:46:04,885 --> 01:46:05,817
Yeah. l heard

1230
01:46:08,821 --> 01:46:10,152
What's wrong with you?

1231
01:46:12,292 --> 01:46:13,884
You pushed her, didn't you?

1232
01:46:14,727 --> 01:46:17,287
No

1233
01:46:17,363 --> 01:46:20,230
How can you say that to me?
Julie saw it

1234
01:46:20,333 --> 01:46:25,827
She couldn't have seen it.
l saw Julie and her back was to you

1235
01:46:29,775 --> 01:46:31,470
She saw it

1236
01:46:34,345 --> 01:46:39,214
Okay

1237
01:46:39,583 --> 01:46:41,312
Have fun at your party

1238
01:46:42,119 --> 01:46:48,148
Come here, Molly! You have to come
Andrew will be there

1239
01:46:48,224 --> 01:46:49,521
l don't care

1240
01:46:52,362 --> 01:46:58,323
lt ain't a party without you

1241
01:46:58,735 --> 01:46:59,826
Let go of me

1242
01:47:00,502 --> 01:47:02,629
Let go of me!

1243
01:47:20,655 --> 01:47:30,325
To the one and only beautiful girl
in the world

1244
01:47:36,670 --> 01:47:37,601
One minute

1245
01:47:45,378 --> 01:47:46,970
Oh, my God

1246
01:47:47,179 --> 01:47:51,842
So, what l want to know is...

1247
01:47:53,885 --> 01:47:55,648
where's Andrew?

1248
01:48:02,160 --> 01:48:03,387
Look

1249
01:48:06,496 --> 01:48:11,160
Nomi Malone Goddess

1250
01:48:15,004 --> 01:48:16,493
l love your outfit

1251
01:48:20,042 --> 01:48:23,808
Nomi...
you think l could be your understudy?

1252
01:48:26,048 --> 01:48:27,845
l'll see what l can do

1253
01:48:29,216 --> 01:48:30,774
Thanks, darling

1254
01:48:33,320 --> 01:48:35,982
Andrew Carver's here.
l want to introduce you

1255
01:48:36,390 --> 01:48:37,379
Andrew's here!

1256
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:49,735
Andrew Carver...Nomi Malone

1257
01:48:50,136 --> 01:48:51,364
You were sensational tonight

1258
01:48:51,438 --> 01:48:52,871
Thank you.
And you're welcome

1259
01:48:55,140 --> 01:48:56,505
Where did you find her?

1260
01:48:56,909 --> 01:48:58,206
l'll never tell

1261
01:49:01,213 --> 01:49:02,578
l like your songs

1262
01:49:03,415 --> 01:49:07,817
And l like your ass. Call me

1263
01:49:11,355 --> 01:49:12,720
Molly Abrams...

1264
01:49:13,091 --> 01:49:15,059
Andrew Carver

1265
01:49:17,328 --> 01:49:19,455
l can't even thread a needle anymore

1266
01:49:21,765 --> 01:49:22,754
Sorry?

1267
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:25,500
Molly's one of your biggest fans

1268
01:49:25,936 --> 01:49:28,166
Well, then...let me get you a drink

1269
01:49:30,307 --> 01:49:31,205
Come on

1270
01:49:38,314 --> 01:49:39,508
Enjoy

1271
01:49:40,483 --> 01:49:41,916
You look beautiful tonight

1272
01:50:33,798 --> 01:50:34,730
What's going on?

1273
01:50:39,236 --> 01:50:40,760
Just want to party, baby

1274
01:50:43,507 --> 01:50:44,496
Let me go!

1275
01:50:44,909 --> 01:50:45,898
Get her!

1276
01:50:47,745 --> 01:50:49,474
Let me go!
Shut the fuck up!

1277
01:50:52,148 --> 01:50:53,206
Throw her down!

1278
01:50:57,086 --> 01:50:58,383
Fuck her!

1279
01:50:58,788 --> 01:51:00,153
Fuck her, man

1280
01:51:00,623 --> 01:51:03,113
Fuck her! Fuck her!

1281
01:51:03,192 --> 01:51:04,625
Let me go!

1282
01:51:04,693 --> 01:51:06,126
Fuck her!

1283
01:51:15,203 --> 01:51:17,170
l could fall in love with you

1284
01:51:46,097 --> 01:51:47,792
Let's get out of here

1285
01:51:54,137 --> 01:51:55,764
Molly?

1286
01:52:01,545 --> 01:52:04,776
We have her sedated. She's in shock

1287
01:52:05,749 --> 01:52:09,115
She has a broken nose, vaginal tears

1288
01:52:09,552 --> 01:52:11,452
She'll be here three or four days

1289
01:52:14,190 --> 01:52:15,817
Zack!

1290
01:52:42,316 --> 01:52:43,510
Look at this

1291
01:52:43,884 --> 01:52:46,716
And look at this. Later

1292
01:52:47,120 --> 01:52:49,213
Where are the police?
They're not here

1293
01:52:49,289 --> 01:52:51,917
Why not?
Because they're not coming!

1294
01:52:55,895 --> 01:52:57,453
Don't do it...

1295
01:52:57,530 --> 01:52:58,518
Polly

1296
01:53:06,938 --> 01:53:08,633
How did you find out?

1297
01:53:09,007 --> 01:53:11,873
You were busted at a fight
at the Crave Club

1298
01:53:11,976 --> 01:53:13,603
The police took your fingerprints

1299
01:53:15,279 --> 01:53:16,371
l won't listen to this

1300
01:53:16,447 --> 01:53:18,506
Yes, you will!

1301
01:53:21,419 --> 01:53:23,477
You're Polly Ann Costello!

1302
01:53:23,553 --> 01:53:25,817
Your father killed your mother,
then killed himself!

1303
01:53:26,690 --> 01:53:30,023
You ran away from a foster home
in Oakland in 1990!

1304
01:53:30,093 --> 01:53:32,789
Arrests: Denver, soliciting...
Stop it!

1305
01:53:32,862 --> 01:53:36,797
San Jose, Cheyenne, soliciting!
Shall l read the rest?

1306
01:53:36,865 --> 01:53:41,268
Possession of crack cocaine!
Assault with a deadly weapon!

1307
01:53:42,805 --> 01:53:46,070
Tell me something.
Why did you stop hooking?

1308
01:53:46,475 --> 01:53:49,500
You had your future pretty well
mapped out

1309
01:53:51,579 --> 01:53:53,171
l did what l had to do

1310
01:53:54,315 --> 01:53:56,306
Just like you did with Cristal

1311
01:53:59,153 --> 01:54:00,711
l'm not a whore

1312
01:54:02,889 --> 01:54:06,347
No...you're not

1313
01:54:07,928 --> 01:54:10,021
You're going to be a big star

1314
01:54:11,598 --> 01:54:14,066
Your face will be up on billboards
