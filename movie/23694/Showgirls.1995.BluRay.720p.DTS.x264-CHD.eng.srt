What difference does it make?

508
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,832
Did you enjoy that out there?

509

Smith, l'm talking to you!

523
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,905
You don't want to be in this kind of show

524
00:44:36,809 --> 00:44:39,243
At least what you do is honest

525
00:44:39,312 --> 00:44:41,712
They want tits and ass, that's what you give

526
00:44:42,048 --> 00:44:46,678
Here, they pretend they want something else, you still show tits and ass

527
00:44:46,786 --> 00:44:50,552
You want to work her, work her on your own time

You and me, we ain't got no ties

Someone who wanted to be in the number

You're not giving her my part, are you?

l worked very hard for that reputation, so don't do it.

She's pretty memorable. l'm glad you're part of the team. Nice dress

They'll run through it. You watch

679
00:56:42,534 --> 00:56:43,899
Did you eat?

680
00:56:44,236 --> 00:56:45,760
Jack! What do you want?

681
00:56:46,538 --> 00:56:48,062
Burger, fries and soda

682
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:50,870
Get her some brown rice, vegetables and an Evian

683
00:56:52,044 --> 00:56:54,478
No, Nomi, come take a look at this

Here we go! Five, six, seven, eight!

00:57:06,892 --> 00:57:09,759
You try it now. Ready?

00:57:09,828 --> 00:57:12,456
Go! Five, six, seven, hit it!

687
00:57:16,501 --> 00:57:18,469
Kick it! Work it!

688
00:57:18,537 --> 00:57:21,529
Hold it! Nomi, what kind of turn was that?

689
00:57:21,873 --> 00:57:24,535
Do a pique turn. Come on

690
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:26,639
That's it. Okay, music!

691
00:57:27,412 --> 00:57:30,404
Go! Hah! Go!

692
00:57:33,452 --> 00:57:34,749
Higher

693
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:35,980
Not that high

694
00:57:38,056 --> 00:57:39,523
Stay in sync!

695
00:57:40,125 --> 00:57:42,150
One, two, three, one!

696
00:57:42,461 --> 00:57:45,123
Thrust it! Thrust it!

697
00:57:45,497 --> 00:57:48,796
Thrust it! Come on!

698
00:57:50,102 --> 00:57:51,467
Okay! That's enough. Thank you, ladies

699
00:57:56,708 --> 00:57:58,005
Good job

700
00:57:58,677 --> 00:58:01,077
Work on her turns. l'm worried about her balance

701
00:58:01,813 --> 00:58:03,678
How long before l can do the show?

702
00:58:03,749 --> 00:58:04,738
You start tonight

703
00:58:06,818 --> 00:58:08,649
Tonight? You'll be fine

704
00:58:12,157 --> 00:58:13,351
How did she do?

705
00:58:13,425 --> 00:58:14,449
She's no butterfly

706
00:58:15,894 --> 00:58:20,331
She's all pelvic thrust. She prowls. She's got it

707
00:58:20,399 --> 00:58:21,764
l wonder how she got it?

708
00:58:22,134 --> 00:58:23,499
She didn't learn it

709
00:58:23,568 --> 00:58:25,934
She learned it, but it's not taught in any class

710
00:58:28,774 --> 00:58:30,935
You need more orange. Let me do it

711
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:34,839
How do you feel?

712
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:37,047
Don't ask. Don't ask!

713
00:58:37,883 --> 00:58:39,043
Who took my make-up?

714
00:58:39,117 --> 00:58:41,449
Monkey alert! Monkey alert!

715
00:58:45,157 --> 00:58:47,091
Damn it, Hector! l told you!

716
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:49,327
They get the heat! They make babies!

717
00:58:49,394 --> 00:58:50,418
Babies?

718
00:58:52,097 --> 00:58:52,995
Oh, get it out

719
00:58:53,332 --> 00:58:54,299
Watch it

720
00:58:57,169 --> 00:58:59,137
Go! Go! Grab her!

721
00:58:59,604 --> 00:59:01,265
Hey! l got one!

The rest are upstairs

723
00:59:04,042 --> 00:59:06,977
Julie, you slut, don't touch my make-up!

724
00:59:07,045 --> 00:59:09,639
l'm a slut? You fucked that pizza place kid!

725
00:59:09,715 --> 00:59:10,841
You fucked the meter reader!

726
00:59:11,149 --> 00:59:13,515
Bitch! You're fucking dead!

727
00:59:15,821 --> 00:59:17,846
Jesus, Annie, get off her!

728
00:59:18,256 --> 00:59:20,190
Julie! Calm down! Stop it!

729
00:59:20,726 --> 00:59:23,126
Now settle down! lt's done!

730
00:59:25,964 --> 00:59:27,261

You're fine. Let's move up, you guys!

734
00:59:35,307 --> 00:59:36,467
There's shit on the stage

00:59:37,376 --> 00:59:39,742
They always shit. lt's that garlic

736

Where? Top left

737

Upstage left, monkey shit. Let's go!

738
00:59:44,449 --> 00:59:45,541
Want some blow?

739
00:59:46,184 --> 00:59:47,776
Last chance for ice

00:59:50,222 --> 00:59:55,489
Let's go!

747
01:01:07,632 --> 01:01:12,797
Ladies and gentlemen, the Stardust presents Miss Cristal Connors

Good luck. Love, Zack Carey

Your leg extension needs work. Someone will work with you. Be here at noon

753
01:02:36,443 --> 01:02:37,535
Put this on. You're done

754
01:02:43,917 --> 01:02:46,886

755
01:02:46,953 --> 01:02:48,011
Hey, yo!

756
01:02:48,855 --> 01:02:50,083
Can l talk to you a minute?

757

Come on, please?

758
01:02:53,793 --> 01:02:54,657
Talk

759
01:02:55,195 --> 01:02:56,219
Alone?

760
01:02:57,530 --> 01:02:59,430
l'll get the car. Be right there

761
01:03:04,237 --> 01:03:05,397
Who sent you the flowers?

762
01:03:07,774 --> 01:03:09,002
None of your business

763
01:03:10,076 --> 01:03:12,874
Okay. l just wanted to say...

764
01:03:12,979 --> 01:03:14,674
You and me ain't got no ties

765
01:03:20,253 --> 01:03:22,187
l have a problem with pussy

766
01:03:22,689 --> 01:03:25,385
l always have, and l always will

767
01:03:25,725 --> 01:03:26,851
But l meant what l said

768
01:03:26,927 --> 01:03:30,920
l don't care about your problems. l did write it for you

769
01:03:32,699 --> 01:03:36,066
But l did tell her l would teach her, and l did fuck her

770
01:03:36,736 --> 01:03:39,762
Who you fuck is your business l won't make it mine

771
01:03:41,675 --> 01:03:45,042
lt's not like l'm seeing any money for writing that number

772
01:03:46,179 --> 01:03:48,670
l may as well touch a little pussy

773
01:03:51,318 --> 01:03:53,286
You got nothing to say

774
01:03:54,054 --> 01:03:55,419
No

775
01:03:56,556 --> 01:03:58,023
Thanks for the flowers!

776
01:03:58,959 --> 01:04:00,517
Tony said you did great!

777
01:04:01,428 --> 01:04:03,225
l never got flowers before

778
01:04:04,431 --> 01:04:07,229
l'm sure you'll get lots of them

779
01:04:09,436 --> 01:04:10,698
He gave them to you?

780
01:04:11,771 --> 01:04:12,965
Yeah, he did

781
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:15,833
What is he? A pimp?

782
01:04:16,309 --> 01:04:18,743
Only people with pimp cars are pimps

783
01:04:19,279 --> 01:04:21,577
He's the entertainment director

784
01:04:21,648 --> 01:04:23,513
That's what l said. He's a pimp!

785
01:04:23,883 --> 01:04:25,043
Let's go!

786
01:04:28,588 --> 01:04:30,522
Good luck with your number

787
01:04:54,981 --> 01:04:56,710
Hello?

788
01:04:59,219 --> 01:05:00,846
Anybody here?

789
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:02,512
Back here

790
01:05:04,391 --> 01:05:06,120
What are you doing here?

791
01:05:06,426 --> 01:05:08,724
What am l doing here?

792
01:05:10,130 --> 01:05:14,362
Doing some of the finest cocaine in the world. Want some?

793
01:05:19,372 --> 01:05:21,533
lt's great for the muscles

794
01:05:24,677 --> 01:05:27,612
l told Marty l'd work on turns with you...

795
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:30,308
but l'm feeling a little inside-out

796
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:32,083
Cut the shit

797
01:05:32,485 --> 01:05:33,543
Okay

798
01:05:34,654 --> 01:05:37,555
We got off on the wrong foot

799
01:05:38,258 --> 01:05:40,317
Want to start dancing all over again?

800
01:05:41,361 --> 01:05:43,295
Why?

801
01:05:43,363 --> 01:05:44,887
Why not?

802
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:49,098
Want to go eat at Spago?

803
01:05:49,169 --> 01:05:50,295
Where is it?

804
01:05:50,603 --> 01:05:52,036
Just down from Ver-sayce

805
01:05:52,939 --> 01:05:54,133
Versace

806
01:05:54,207 --> 01:05:57,199
Ahh, right. Versace

807
01:06:11,057 --> 01:06:12,354
Enjoy

808
01:06:16,463 --> 01:06:18,192
What is all this stuff?

809
01:06:18,298 --> 01:06:19,765
l'll order for you

810
01:06:21,267 --> 01:06:23,531
l'll have brown rice and vegetables

811
01:06:24,904 --> 01:06:27,668
Do you like brown rice and vegetables?

812
01:06:29,342 --> 01:06:30,604
You do?

813
01:06:31,578 --> 01:06:32,806
Sort of

814
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:35,279
Really?

815
01:06:38,384 --> 01:06:40,579
lt's worse than dog food

816
01:06:41,154 --> 01:06:42,246
lt is

817
01:06:44,724 --> 01:06:47,090
l've had dog food

818
01:06:48,595 --> 01:06:49,994
You have?

819
01:06:51,564 --> 01:06:53,259
A long time ago

820
01:06:54,267 --> 01:06:56,201
Doggy chow

821
01:06:57,370 --> 01:06:59,736
l used to love Doggy Chow

822
01:07:00,373 --> 01:07:02,841
l used to love Doggy Chow, too

823
01:07:15,622 --> 01:07:17,522
l got a headache from champagne

824
01:07:17,924 --> 01:07:20,256
This isn't champagne

825
01:07:21,261 --> 01:07:24,594
This is holy water

826
01:07:25,698 --> 01:07:28,030
l named myself after this holy water

827
01:07:28,501 --> 01:07:32,164
Chrissie Lou Connors had dingy brown hair and little tits

828
01:07:33,072 --> 01:07:36,940
lt's amazing what paint and a surgeon can do

829
01:07:45,285 --> 01:07:47,082
You have great tits

830
01:07:47,854 --> 01:07:49,754
They're beautiful

831
01:07:50,557 --> 01:07:51,819
Thank you

835
01:08:02,769 --> 01:08:04,999
How do you like having them?

836
01:08:09,309 --> 01:08:10,799
What do you mean?

837
01:08:11,878 --> 01:08:14,278
You know what l mean

838
01:08:18,184 --> 01:08:20,948
l like having them in a nice dress...

839
01:08:21,321 --> 01:08:23,152
or a tight top

840
01:08:25,758 --> 01:08:28,386
You like to show them off

841
01:08:30,597 --> 01:08:33,065
l didn't like showing them at the Cheetah

842
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,227
Why not?

843
01:08:35,602 --> 01:08:39,902
l liked looking at them there. Everybody did

844
01:08:40,673 --> 01:08:42,334
lt made me feel like a hooker

845
01:08:42,709 --> 01:08:44,336
You are a whore, darling

846
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:45,809
l'm not!

847
01:08:45,878 --> 01:08:47,311
We all are

848
01:08:47,714 --> 01:08:52,481
We take the cash, we cash the check, we show them what they want to see

849
01:08:52,552 --> 01:08:55,282
Maybe you're a whore, but l'm not

850
01:08:58,458 --> 01:09:00,790
You and me...

851
01:09:00,893 --> 01:09:04,385
we're exactly alike

852
01:09:12,505 --> 01:09:14,871
l'll never be like you

853
01:09:19,445 --> 01:09:23,643
Miss Connors! Sorry to bother you Would you sign this for me?

854
01:09:23,716 --> 01:09:25,877

01:09:25,952 --> 01:09:28,284

857
01:09:31,457 --> 01:09:34,551
l told you she was from Texas. Whoo-ee, look at that!

858
01:09:35,428 --> 01:09:37,020
Could l have one like that?

859
01:09:37,397 --> 01:09:40,195
You want a girl to use up all her lipstick on you?

860
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,468
Want to dance? Right now?

861
01:09:43,836 --> 01:09:46,464
lt's now or never. That's what Elvis said

862
01:09:50,843 --> 01:09:53,710
You know the best advice l ever got?

863
01:09:53,780 --> 01:09:57,546
You're up there onstage, hoping on a spot

864
01:09:57,917 --> 01:10:01,250
lf someone gets in your way, step on them

865
01:10:01,788 --> 01:10:05,781
lf you're the only one left standing there, they hire you

866
01:10:06,492 --> 01:10:09,154
That's about it. Thank you and good night

867
01:10:09,262 --> 01:10:12,163
Elvis has left the building

868
01:11:18,398 --> 01:11:20,457
You see, darling...

869
01:11:20,566 --> 01:11:22,500
you are a whore

870
01:11:25,471 --> 01:11:26,938
Bitch!

871
01:11:31,978 --> 01:11:34,105
Guess we're done

872
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:47,922
Nicky, can l talk to you for a second?

873
01:11:55,868 --> 01:11:58,336
Mommy, can we see the monkeys? Not now

Please. They're so cute. They have to work

875
01:12:01,808 --> 01:12:03,241
What are they doing?

876
01:12:03,309 --> 01:12:05,436

877
01:12:05,511 --> 01:12:06,910

878

01:12:09,916 --> 01:12:12,714
You said the F'' word! She said the ''F'' word''

880
01:12:13,085 --> 01:12:14,279
She said the F'' word!''

881
01:12:14,353 --> 01:12:15,980
Shut the fuck up!

882
01:12:23,763 --> 01:12:25,390
lt's okay. lt's okay

883
01:12:27,166 --> 01:12:31,102
Nomi, a boat convention's coming into town next week

884
01:12:31,204 --> 01:12:33,339

You interested? lt pays $1,000

886
01:12:38,277 --> 01:12:41,178
A thousand dollars? To do what?

887
01:12:41,514 --> 01:12:46,042
Represent the hotel. You wear your costume, smile, they take your picture

888
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:48,685
A thousand dollars?

889
01:12:52,758 --> 01:12:55,784

01:13:04,637 --> 01:13:07,538
Cristal, about the magazine layout...? Later

893
01:13:07,607 --> 01:13:08,835
Don't do it

894
01:13:09,709 --> 01:13:11,233
lt's $1,000. Why not?

895
01:13:11,344 --> 01:13:12,402
Molly, l need you!

896
01:13:12,478 --> 01:13:15,914
l'm coming. l know girls who did it and they...

897
01:13:15,982 --> 01:13:17,916
Molly, l'm waiting

898
01:13:19,252 --> 01:13:20,651
They didn't like it

899
01:13:27,059 --> 01:13:28,651
Did you do it before?

900
01:13:29,328 --> 01:13:30,317
Did you like it?

901
01:13:30,830 --> 01:13:33,731
Did l like it? Sure, l liked it

902
01:14:00,126 --> 01:14:05,621
Let's thank these 2 beautiful girls from Goddess'', a new smash at the Stardust''

903
01:14:11,804 --> 01:14:13,135
Shit

904
01:14:13,205 --> 01:14:15,308
How's it going? Fine

905
01:14:15,308 --> 01:14:16,707
Tough gig, huh?

906
01:14:16,776 --> 01:14:17,902
Very

907
01:14:18,444 --> 01:14:21,277
This is my good friend, Mr. Okida, from Bangkok

908
01:14:21,847 --> 01:14:25,374
He's one of our very, very high rollers

909
01:14:25,484 --> 01:14:28,920
Ladies, we want to take you to dinner after the show

910
01:14:28,988 --> 01:14:31,957
Have some lobster, hear Caesar sing

911
01:14:32,024 --> 01:14:35,960
You ever heard Caesar sing? The guy's great. You'll love him

912
01:14:36,696 --> 01:14:37,822
Caesar sing?

913
01:14:38,230 --> 01:14:41,666
Then we'll go back to my place and we'll sing

914
01:14:42,201 --> 01:14:43,463
Just the four of us

915
01:14:44,503 --> 01:14:45,731
How about it?

916
01:14:49,208 --> 01:14:51,199
We sing

917
01:14:53,279 --> 01:14:56,373
Yeah, we'll sing a lot of songs

918
01:14:59,352 --> 01:15:00,341
Okay

919
01:15:00,620 --> 01:15:02,178
Good deal

920
01:15:02,254 --> 01:15:05,485
Okay. Good deal

921
01:15:07,727 --> 01:15:09,718
Not me

922
01:15:14,734 --> 01:15:16,998
Be nice. Let go of me!

923
01:15:17,303 --> 01:15:18,861
You got $1,000 for this

924
01:15:18,938 --> 01:15:21,429
Yeah, for this! This!

925
01:15:21,874 --> 01:15:23,432
Oh, forget it

926
01:15:23,676 --> 01:15:26,941
Just forget it! No harm done! No damage!

927
01:15:27,013 --> 01:15:28,207
Christ!

928
01:15:36,188 --> 01:15:37,177
Zack?

929
01:15:38,391 --> 01:15:39,653
l want to talk to you

930
01:15:41,293 --> 01:15:45,161
Let's go upstairs

931
01:15:45,798 --> 01:15:47,322
Have a nice day, darling?

932
01:15:49,468 --> 01:15:50,594
No

933
01:15:53,506 --> 01:15:55,565
l'm sorry to hear that

934
01:15:58,544 --> 01:15:59,977
Jesus

935
01:16:03,382 --> 01:16:07,113
l'm sorry. Some people just don't get it

936
01:16:09,021 --> 01:16:12,184
l'm on the stage. Get me Phil

937
01:16:13,492 --> 01:16:14,459
Thank you

938
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:16,350
Stay

939
01:16:19,899 --> 01:16:21,867
The drop is up 33% on those machines

940
01:16:21,967 --> 01:16:25,266
lt will make your bottom line about 250

941
01:16:29,008 --> 01:16:30,908
l got an MBA for this

942
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:36,106
That's what this business is now cost analyzing slot machines

943
01:16:36,615 --> 01:16:38,583
What's an MBA?

944
01:16:40,219 --> 01:16:42,016
Zack, you in here?

945
01:16:43,189 --> 01:16:44,213
Excuse me

946
01:16:45,357 --> 01:16:47,951
Hey! What's going on?

947
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:50,085
You do anything like this again, you're fired

948
01:16:50,596 --> 01:16:52,791
Nothing happened. Something did!

949
01:16:53,232 --> 01:16:54,859
She jumped to conclusions

950
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:59,699
lt happens again, you'll jump to your conclusion

951
01:17:00,039 --> 01:17:01,939
Without your golden parachute

952
01:17:03,576 --> 01:17:05,271
You owe her an apology

953
01:17:08,948 --> 01:17:11,508
Nomi, l'm sorry. l apologize

954
01:17:12,218 --> 01:17:13,617
Yeah, fine. Okay

955
01:17:16,922 --> 01:17:18,219
Get out

956
01:17:21,327 --> 01:17:26,060
An MBA is a college degree. lt's mostly worthless in the real world

957
01:17:29,435 --> 01:17:31,027
You go for it, don't you?

958
01:17:32,171 --> 01:17:34,366
Yeah, l try to

959
01:17:37,710 --> 01:17:39,337
Showtime

960
01:17:40,012 --> 01:17:41,445
That's for sure

961
01:17:51,457 --> 01:17:53,755
Phil, you dumb fuck, get back up here

962
01:17:55,294 --> 01:17:56,727
l know, l know

963
01:18:05,704 --> 01:18:10,334
Thank you for looking out for me. You were so nice to recommend me to Phil

964
01:18:10,810 --> 01:18:12,437
What are friends for?

965
01:18:13,946 --> 01:18:15,072
Right

966
01:18:22,021 --> 01:18:24,012
You were right about the convention

967
01:18:25,424 --> 01:18:26,584
Sweet baby!

968
01:18:27,827 --> 01:18:30,295
Do that again, l'll break your fingers!

969
01:18:30,362 --> 01:18:32,990
Not my fault you don't have a gay partner

970
01:18:33,098 --> 01:18:34,122
Fuck you

971
01:18:34,233 --> 01:18:37,202
He wants everyone to see how hetero he is

972
01:18:37,303 --> 01:18:40,033
Molly, bring that flashlight so l can see how big it is

973
01:18:40,406 --> 01:18:42,431
You want a knuckle sandwich?

974
01:18:42,775 --> 01:18:45,039
Can l have mine anally, please?

975
01:18:45,110 --> 01:18:47,044
Come on, you guys! Jesus!

976
01:18:47,112 --> 01:18:48,841
Let's go! Let's line it up!

977
01:18:49,582 --> 01:18:50,913
What you looking at, bitch?

978
01:18:51,250 --> 01:18:54,048
Okay, let's go. Move it! Go, go, go!

979
01:19:32,791 --> 01:19:34,088
Oh, my God

980
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:03,483
Are you okay, Annie?

981
01:20:23,142 --> 01:20:24,609
lt's my leg

982
01:20:24,677 --> 01:20:26,042
Tell me when it hurts

983
01:20:28,047 --> 01:20:29,036
lt's her knee

984
01:20:29,481 --> 01:20:30,641
lt isn't broken, is it?

985
01:20:31,216 --> 01:20:32,683
Daryl, what happened?

986
01:20:33,085 --> 01:20:34,643
My foot went out from under me

987
01:20:36,889 --> 01:20:38,754
This is what happened

988
01:20:42,094 --> 01:20:43,823
l wonder how those got up here?

989
01:20:44,463 --> 01:20:46,294
Probably came off a costume

990
01:20:46,665 --> 01:20:48,530
We'll get you to the hospital

991
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:49,897
Shit, no!

992
01:20:49,969 --> 01:20:53,405
Jesus. Poor Annie. Tough break

993
01:20:53,772 --> 01:20:54,796
Let us through here

994
01:20:59,378 --> 01:21:00,538
See you later

995
01:21:02,247 --> 01:21:03,236
l'm the producer

996
01:21:03,315 --> 01:21:05,943
l hired you! You do what l say

997
01:21:06,018 --> 01:21:08,680
She was my understudy. l have a say, too

998
01:21:08,754 --> 01:21:11,290
Yeah, but guess who makes the decision

999
01:21:11,290 --> 01:21:12,655
lt's broken, kids

1000
01:21:13,258 --> 01:21:16,095
Shit. That will be three months

1001
01:21:16,095 --> 01:21:16,891
At least

1002
01:21:19,665 --> 01:21:21,030
Bad karma, huh?

1003
01:21:21,333 --> 01:21:23,130
Nomi, your mother's waiting for you

1004
01:21:24,103 --> 01:21:25,400
My mother?

1005
01:21:25,938 --> 01:21:29,135
For your sake, l hope she's not

1006
01:21:31,110 --> 01:21:33,374
lf a light sleeper sleeps with a light on

1007
01:21:33,445 --> 01:21:35,470
Can a hard sleeper sleep with a hard on?

1008
01:21:35,781 --> 01:21:39,911
What do you call a tiger? A big pussy that eats people

1009
01:21:39,985 --> 01:21:41,077
Henry!

1010
01:21:44,223 --> 01:21:47,021
l can get shit on, but l don't like getting spit on

1011
01:21:49,862 --> 01:21:51,022
Hi, Al

1012
01:21:51,897 --> 01:21:53,091
You look like shit

1013
01:21:53,766 --> 01:21:56,633
She looks better than a 10-inch dick and you know it

1014
01:21:58,303 --> 01:22:01,204
So...do you like it here?

1015
01:22:01,273 --> 01:22:02,638
What, you think she misses you?

1016
01:22:03,308 --> 01:22:04,741
Yeah, why not?

1017
01:22:05,277 --> 01:22:06,676
We miss her

1018
01:22:06,779 --> 01:22:11,045
She misses us like that lump on my twat l had taken off last week

1019
01:22:11,116 --> 01:22:12,344
Jesus, Henry

1020
01:22:20,526 --> 01:22:21,925
We saw the show

1021
01:22:23,595 --> 01:22:25,028
You were good

1022
01:22:27,266 --> 01:22:28,597
Thank you, Al

1023
01:22:33,405 --> 01:22:35,339
Real good

1024
01:22:38,777 --> 01:22:41,143
You take care, kid

1025
01:22:46,351 --> 01:22:50,412
Must be weird, not having anyone come on you

1026
01:22:55,561 --> 01:22:58,428
Nomi. Hey, you want a ride?

1027
01:23:00,999 --> 01:23:01,988
l got one

1028
01:23:06,605 --> 01:23:07,833
Wait!

1029
01:23:11,977 --> 01:23:13,467
Ever been in one of these?

1030
01:23:13,545 --> 01:23:14,375
No

1031
01:23:15,314 --> 01:23:16,713
l always wanted one

1032
01:23:18,984 --> 01:23:21,418
lt's some car, huh? lt doesn't suck

1033
01:23:23,222 --> 01:23:25,588
Where are we headed? Give me directions

1034
01:23:27,693 --> 01:23:29,058
To your place

1035
01:23:48,714 --> 01:23:50,045
Do you like Cristal?

1036
01:23:50,816 --> 01:23:52,909
l like a lot of different champagnes

1037
01:23:54,286 --> 01:23:56,516
But l always drink champagne

1038
01:23:58,223 --> 01:23:59,952
What's Andrew Carver like?

1039
01:24:00,659 --> 01:24:03,560
Are you nervous? Don't be

1040
01:24:04,530 --> 01:24:05,895
l'm not

1041
01:24:11,103 --> 01:24:13,401
l liked it when you came

1042
01:24:16,542 --> 01:24:18,669
l liked your eyes

1043
01:27:29,401 --> 01:27:30,993
Stay with me

1044
01:27:31,737 --> 01:27:33,466
l'll drive you back in the morning

1045
01:27:33,805 --> 01:27:35,272
lt is morning

1046
01:27:35,974 --> 01:27:37,236
Please?

1047
01:27:37,309 --> 01:27:38,640
l have a taxi coming

1048
01:27:39,378 --> 01:27:40,845
Send it back

1049
01:27:46,551 --> 01:27:48,712
Cristal needs a new understudy

1050
01:27:50,255 --> 01:27:53,554
There's an audition at noon. You want to try?

1051
01:27:55,494 --> 01:27:58,361
Would you have told me if l hadn't come here?

1052
01:27:58,730 --> 01:28:01,722
lt was your idea to come here, not mine

1053
01:28:06,204 --> 01:28:08,502
l want to see you again

1054
01:28:09,741 --> 01:28:11,299
We'll see how it goes

1055
01:28:15,347 --> 01:28:17,577
What, the audition?

1056
01:28:27,359 --> 01:28:28,883
Ten-fifty

1057
01:28:38,036 --> 01:28:39,367
Hello!

1058
01:28:42,140 --> 01:28:43,266
l hate you

1059
01:28:44,309 --> 01:28:46,573
Who was he? Zack

1060
01:28:46,912 --> 01:28:48,777
Oh, my God

1061
01:28:49,381 --> 01:28:50,746
Did you tie him up?

1062
01:28:51,183 --> 01:28:52,207
Oh, shit

1063
01:28:53,185 --> 01:28:54,846
l forgot to untie him

1064
01:28:59,524 --> 01:29:00,786
Are you high?

1065
01:29:01,226 --> 01:29:02,955
Maybe a little

1066
01:29:04,863 --> 01:29:09,266
l can't go to sleep. l have an audition at noon. Where are the Sugar Snaps?

1067
01:29:09,634 --> 01:29:11,898
ln the cupboard. Nomi...

1068
01:29:12,304 --> 01:29:14,329
don't get sucked into it

1069
01:29:17,075 --> 01:29:18,633
Look what l found!

1070
01:29:21,446 --> 01:29:23,141
Okay, whatever, Nomes

1071
01:29:53,478 --> 01:29:54,672
Julie

1072
01:29:55,247 --> 01:29:58,080
She's not hot enough. She has it down

1073
01:29:58,283 --> 01:30:01,912
You can teach it. She doesn't have Cristal's heat

1074
01:30:02,254 --> 01:30:04,313
None of them have Cristal's heat

1075
01:30:05,056 --> 01:30:06,785
l do love you, Gay

1076
01:30:07,259 --> 01:30:08,658
Nomi has heat

1077
01:30:10,262 --> 01:30:11,354
Does she?

1078
01:30:12,430 --> 01:30:13,727
Yes, she does

1079
01:30:15,233 --> 01:30:17,292
ln a totally different way

1080
01:30:17,736 --> 01:30:20,500
Come on! She's going to take the lead?

1081
01:30:20,872 --> 01:30:23,636
This a hotel show! lt's not the Cheetah!

1082
01:30:23,975 --> 01:30:27,342
lt doesn't matter l haven't missed a show in 8 years

1083
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:29,703
You're not getting any younger

1084
01:30:29,881 --> 01:30:31,109
Eat me

1085
01:30:31,850 --> 01:30:33,818
Want to see it again with just Nomi? No

1086
01:30:34,319 --> 01:30:36,253
l do. Set it up, Marty

1087
01:30:36,321 --> 01:30:37,618
This is bullshit

1088
01:30:38,356 --> 01:30:39,846
lt's about your dick

1089
01:30:40,225 --> 01:30:41,453
Nicky, Julie, thank you!

1090
01:30:42,460 --> 01:30:43,688
What do we know about her?

1091
01:30:43,795 --> 01:30:46,696
Nothing. l doubt her Social Security number's right

1092
01:30:46,765 --> 01:30:48,232
Find out. What?

1093
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:49,392
Everything

1094
01:31:03,982 --> 01:31:05,711
You fucked her, didn't you?

1095
01:31:06,284 --> 01:31:10,687
Are you pissed off because you're jealous?

1096
01:31:10,755 --> 01:31:12,814
Or because l beat you to the punch?

1097
01:31:34,079 --> 01:31:37,879
You fuck him for the spot or because you wanted to?

1098
01:31:40,885 --> 01:31:43,251
l say you did it for the spot

1099
01:31:43,822 --> 01:31:46,484
ls that what you did, Cristal?

1100
01:31:47,092 --> 01:31:50,550
You don't want to piss me off, now that we're friends

1101
01:31:51,096 --> 01:31:54,065
No, you shouldn't get pissed off

1102
01:31:54,366 --> 01:31:55,833
lt makes you look older

1103
01:32:01,573 --> 01:32:05,407
You got it

1104
01:32:06,244 --> 01:32:07,609
l do?

1105
01:32:08,747 --> 01:32:10,408
Marty and Gay will work with you

1106
01:32:10,815 --> 01:32:14,148
Phil will have some glossies taken. You did good

1107
01:32:15,253 --> 01:32:17,653
l'll call you for dinner, lobster

1108
01:32:18,023 --> 01:32:20,719
Did you ever hear Caesar sing? You'll love it

1109
01:32:31,703 --> 01:32:33,227
What?

1110
01:32:34,906 --> 01:32:38,467
Congratulations. l see you have many talents

1111
01:32:39,344 --> 01:32:41,175
l thought she did good

1112
01:32:47,218 --> 01:32:51,052
A Private Dance By James Smith The Crave Club

1113
01:33:02,867 --> 01:33:06,963
l didn't know about the audition until afterwards

1114
01:33:10,275 --> 01:33:12,436
Do you like my nails?

1115
01:33:24,122 --> 01:33:26,317
They're not as nice as yours

1116
01:33:31,362 --> 01:33:33,887
Maybe l'll help you with yours sometime

1117
01:33:38,703 --> 01:33:40,603
lf you want

1118
01:33:43,608 --> 01:33:46,509
lsn't that nice of you, darling?

1119
01:33:46,878 --> 01:33:48,812
What are friends for?

1120
01:33:56,721 --> 01:33:58,621
On second thought...

1121
01:34:00,425 --> 01:34:03,223
maybe you shouldn't do mine

1122
01:34:04,662 --> 01:34:08,598
l'm getting too old for that whory look

1123
01:34:09,768 --> 01:34:11,702
l'll think about it

1124
01:34:15,106 --> 01:34:17,404
Close the door on your way out

1125
01:35:12,597 --> 01:35:14,758
Hey, bring on the real dancers!

1126
01:35:17,202 --> 01:35:18,829
Boo!

You suck!

1128
01:35:25,043 --> 01:35:26,601
Get off the stage!

1129
01:35:27,579 --> 01:35:29,979
Enough of this stuff!

1130
01:35:30,381 --> 01:35:32,110
Let's dance!

1131
01:35:43,328 --> 01:35:46,695
l loved it! lt was good

1132
01:35:46,764 --> 01:35:48,698
What are you doing here, slumming?

1133
01:35:48,766 --> 01:35:50,131
Heather!

1134
01:35:51,970 --> 01:35:52,937
Were we good?

1135
01:35:53,037 --> 01:35:53,935
Great

1136
01:35:54,272 --> 01:35:55,569
She dances like a truck!

1137
01:35:56,341 --> 01:35:59,844
l do not! Do you want something to drink?

1138
01:35:59,844 --> 01:36:01,209
Yeah. Get me a beer, bitch

1139
01:36:03,281 --> 01:36:04,748
Look what l got

1140

l stole it from my grandmother

1142
01:36:10,822 --> 01:36:13,848
You did not! You got it at a pawnshop

1143
01:36:22,767 --> 01:36:24,200
We're getting married

1144
01:36:27,372 --> 01:36:28,566
You love her?

1145
01:36:29,874 --> 01:36:32,536
l don't know. She's having a baby

1146
01:36:37,382 --> 01:36:38,542
And this?

1147
01:36:39,684 --> 01:36:44,144
We ain't any good. You heard them. ''Get off the stage!''

1148
01:36:46,124 --> 01:36:47,216
What will you do?

1149
01:36:49,127 --> 01:36:52,824
Work in a grocery store Her mother owns it

1150
01:36:53,798 --> 01:36:56,858
We'll get a discount on baby food

1151
01:37:08,212 --> 01:37:09,474
See ya

1152
01:37:13,351 --> 01:37:18,311
Shit happens, you know? Life sucks. l'm a student of T-shirts!

1153
01:37:29,567 --> 01:37:31,034
Hey, Nicky

1154
01:37:40,278 --> 01:37:41,643
Dear Ms. Malone,

1155
01:37:41,746 --> 01:37:46,046
We regret we are unable to offer you...understudy

1156
01:37:58,696 --> 01:37:59,964
You can't go in there!

1157
01:37:59,964 --> 01:38:00,862
What's going on?

1158
01:38:01,265 --> 01:38:02,664
What's going on?!

1159
01:38:02,734 --> 01:38:05,066
Hey, cool it. Cool it?!

1160
01:38:06,137 --> 01:38:07,764
When you sent me this?!

1161
01:38:07,839 --> 01:38:10,672
She threatened to walk! She got her lawyers into it!

1162
01:38:10,742 --> 01:38:11,800
So what?!

1163
01:38:11,876 --> 01:38:14,174
So, she's a star! You're not worth it

1164
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:17,611
Sorry, Nomi. l tried. Fuck!

1165
01:38:20,318 --> 01:38:25,017
Basically, my G-string snapped. There l was, dancing butt naked for 5 mins

1166
01:38:25,390 --> 01:38:26,982
l mean, my poor partner!

1167
01:38:29,727 --> 01:38:32,389
l thought about it, darling

1168
01:38:34,232 --> 01:38:36,223
Think you could do my nails now?

1169
01:38:42,640 --> 01:38:43,868
Okay

1170
01:38:44,208 --> 01:38:45,800
Maybe some other time

1171
01:40:57,441 --> 01:41:00,877
Come on...slave girl

1172
01:41:04,682 --> 01:41:06,445
We've got five minutes. Go!

1173
01:41:08,653 --> 01:41:13,681
Go, you guys! Run, run!

1174
01:41:20,131 --> 01:41:21,530
Let me through!

1175
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:24,328
Shit!

1176
01:41:25,636 --> 01:41:27,103
Cristal, can you hear me?

1177
01:41:28,039 --> 01:41:29,904
Somebody get Marty!

1178
01:41:34,912 --> 01:41:36,140
What happened? l don't know

1179
01:41:37,081 --> 01:41:38,446
Somebody get an ambulance!

1180
01:41:39,050 --> 01:41:40,312
Who was behind her?

1181
01:41:40,751 --> 01:41:41,547
l was

1182
01:41:42,620 --> 01:41:43,587
What happened?

1183
01:41:45,122 --> 01:41:47,682
l don't know. She just went down

1184
01:41:48,793 --> 01:41:51,284
She slipped. l saw it

1185
01:41:53,197 --> 01:41:55,358
Nomi wasn't even close to her

1186
01:42:13,117 --> 01:42:14,414
Tough break, huh?

1187
01:42:17,688 --> 01:42:18,746
What's wrong?

1188
01:42:19,123 --> 01:42:20,385
Nothing

1189
01:42:40,778 --> 01:42:43,406
Thanks. Keep me informed

1190
01:42:44,649 --> 01:42:47,550
She has a concussion. That'll be all right

1191
01:42:47,918 --> 01:42:50,318
But she has a compound fracture of the hip

1192
01:42:51,022 --> 01:42:52,990
Those take forever to heal

1193
01:42:54,392 --> 01:42:55,654
We have to shut down

1194
01:42:56,060 --> 01:42:58,995
Not a chance. The show goes on

1195
01:42:59,463 --> 01:43:02,796
The Stardust is never dark. lt has never been

1196
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:05,668
lt never will be. Not while l am alive

1197
01:43:07,038 --> 01:43:08,300
Who was her understudy?

1198
01:43:09,507 --> 01:43:11,099
We had a girl who...

1199
01:43:12,143 --> 01:43:13,405
What's funny?

1200
01:43:13,477 --> 01:43:17,675
Cristal Connors is a star, Sam! You can't just replace her

1201
01:43:22,787 --> 01:43:26,018
We could bring someone in while she's out

1202
01:43:26,090 --> 01:43:27,455
She could be out for a year

1203
01:43:27,525 --> 01:43:28,719
Like who?

1204
01:43:29,093 --> 01:43:31,220
Janet Jackson. Paula Abdul

1205
01:43:31,329 --> 01:43:32,796
Paula Abdul? ln my show?

1206
01:43:32,863 --> 01:43:35,855
We're not paying those kind of salaries

1207
01:43:35,966 --> 01:43:39,959
ln that case, Mr. Karlman, we do what we do in Vegas

1208
01:43:41,739 --> 01:43:43,331
We gamble

1209
01:43:46,143 --> 01:43:47,906
Ladies and gentlemen...

1210
01:43:47,978 --> 01:43:52,938
the Stardust proudly presents Miss Nomi Malone

1211
01:44:59,650 --> 01:45:01,447
We could have hired anyone

1212
01:45:01,552 --> 01:45:03,577
Janet Jackson, Paula Abdul

1213
01:45:04,021 --> 01:45:07,889
Nomi Malone is what Las Vegas is all about

1214
01:45:07,958 --> 01:45:10,449
She's dazzling, she's exciting...

1215
01:45:10,561 --> 01:45:14,088
...and very, very sexy. Thank you, Zack

1216
01:45:14,999 --> 01:45:16,728
How did you feel about the show tonight?

1217
01:45:18,536 --> 01:45:20,970
l hope l can be as good as the show

1218
01:45:21,038 --> 01:45:25,441
You are, my dear. You are the show

1219
01:45:28,312 --> 01:45:30,109
Good one. Over here, Nomi

1220
01:45:30,481 --> 01:45:33,609
One more, Nomi! Please, please

1221
01:45:37,488 --> 01:45:38,921
Hey, you ready to party?

1222
01:45:39,723 --> 01:45:42,556
Where? The Paradiso. l rented the bungalows

1223
01:45:42,660 --> 01:45:44,218
For what? For you

1224
01:45:47,798 --> 01:45:49,925
Hurry. l got a limo waiting

1225
01:45:50,034 --> 01:45:52,502
l don't have anything to wear! Yes, you do

1226
01:45:53,337 --> 01:45:56,773
Andrew Carvers' coming He saw the show and thinks you're great

1227
01:45:58,042 --> 01:46:01,102
Did you hear? Andrew Carver will be there!

1228
01:46:01,445 --> 01:46:02,377
Yeah. l heard

1229
01:46:05,382 --> 01:46:06,713
What's wrong with you?

1230
01:46:08,853 --> 01:46:10,445
You pushed her, didn't you?

1231
01:46:11,288 --> 01:46:13,848
No

1232
01:46:13,924 --> 01:46:16,791
How can you say that to me? Julie saw it

1233
01:46:16,894 --> 01:46:22,389
She couldn't have seen it. l saw Julie and her back was to you

1234
01:46:26,337 --> 01:46:28,032
She saw it

1235
01:46:30,908 --> 01:46:35,777
Okay

1236
01:46:36,146 --> 01:46:37,875
Have fun at your party

1237
01:46:38,682 --> 01:46:44,712

01:46:48,926 --> 01:46:54,887

To the one and only beautiful girl in the world

01:47:33,237 --> 01:47:34,169
One minute

01:47:41,946 --> 01:47:43,538

So, what l want to know is...

1246

Thank you. And you're welcome

What's going on?

1272
01:50:35,819 --> 01:50:37,343
Just want to party, baby

1273
01:50:40,090 --> 01:50:41,079
Let me go!

1274
01:50:41,492 --> 01:50:42,481
Get her!

1275
01:50:44,328 --> 01:50:46,057
Let me go! Shut the fuck up!

1276
01:50:48,732 --> 01:50:49,790
Throw her down!

1277
01:50:53,670 --> 01:50:54,967
Fuck her!

1278
01:50:55,372 --> 01:50:56,737
Fuck her, man

1279
01:50:57,207 --> 01:50:59,698
Fuck her! Fuck her!

1280
01:50:59,777 --> 01:51:01,210
Let me go!

1281
01:51:01,278 --> 01:51:02,711
Fuck her!

1282
01:51:11,789 --> 01:51:13,757
l could fall in love with you

1283
01:51:42,686 --> 01:51:44,381
Let's get out of here

1284
01:51:50,727 --> 01:51:52,354
Molly?

1285
01:51:58,135 --> 01:52:01,366
We have her sedated. She's in shock

1286
01:52:02,339 --> 01:52:05,706
She has a broken nose, vaginal tears

1287
01:52:06,143 --> 01:52:08,043
She'll be here three or four days

1288
01:52:10,781 --> 01:52:12,408
Zack!

1289
01:52:38,909 --> 01:52:40,103
Look at this

1290
01:52:40,477 --> 01:52:43,310
And look at this. Later

1291
01:52:43,714 --> 01:52:45,807
Where are the police? They're not here

1292
01:52:45,883 --> 01:52:48,511
Why not? Because they're not coming!

1293
01:52:52,489 --> 01:52:54,047
Don't do it...

1294
01:52:54,124 --> 01:52:55,113
Polly

1295
01:53:03,533 --> 01:53:05,228
How did you find out?

1296
01:53:05,602 --> 01:53:08,469
You were busted at a fight at the Crave Club

1297
01:53:08,572 --> 01:53:10,199
The police took your fingerprints

1298
01:53:11,875 --> 01:53:12,967
l won't listen to this

1299
01:53:13,043 --> 01:53:15,102
Yes, you will!

1300
01:53:18,015 --> 01:53:20,074
You're Polly Ann Costello!

1301
01:53:20,150 --> 01:53:22,414
Your father killed your mother, then killed himself!

1302
01:53:23,287 --> 01:53:26,620
You ran away from a foster home in Oakland in 1990!

1303
01:53:26,690 --> 01:53:29,386
Arrests: Denver, soliciting... Stop it!

1304
01:53:29,459 --> 01:53:33,395
San Jose, Cheyenne, soliciting! Shall l read the rest?

1305
01:53:33,463 --> 01:53:37,866
Possession of crack cocaine! Assault with a deadly weapon!

1306
01:53:39,403 --> 01:53:42,668
Tell me something. Why did you stop hooking?

1307
01:53:43,073 --> 01:53:46,099
You had your future pretty well mapped out

1308
01:53:48,178 --> 01:53:49,770
l did what l had to do

1309
01:53:50,914 --> 01:53:52,905
Just like you did with Cristal

1310
01:53:55,752 --> 01:53:57,310
l'm not a whore

1311
01:53:59,489 --> 01:54:02,947
No...you're not

1312
01:54:04,528 --> 01:54:06,621
You're going to be a big star

1313
01:54:08,198 --> 01:54:10,666
Your face will be up on billboards

1314
01:54:11,468 --> 01:54:15,097
And you will make a lot of money for the Stardust

1315
01:54:30,721 --> 01:54:33,087
You'd let him get away with this?

1316
01:54:33,623 --> 01:54:36,091
Andrew Carver is at the Paradiso this year

1317
01:54:36,393 --> 01:54:39,294
He might be at the Stardust next year

1318
01:54:39,363 --> 01:54:41,661
He's part of the team. So are you

1319
01:54:45,235 --> 01:54:46,793
What about Molly?

1320
01:54:47,471 --> 01:54:51,134
l'll see he gives her enough money to have a dress shop

1321
01:54:54,778 --> 01:54:56,040
Tell me something

1322
01:54:57,814 --> 01:54:59,475
What did you charge?

1323
01:55:01,551 --> 01:55:03,212
Hooking

1324
01:55:07,591 --> 01:55:10,958
Fifty. A hundred sometimes

1325
01:55:12,562 --> 01:55:16,328
You got low self-esteem, baby. You're a fantastic fuck

1326
01:55:26,410 --> 01:55:28,537
l was paying you a compliment

1327
01:56:04,181 --> 01:56:06,615
Showtime

1328
01:56:18,528 --> 01:56:20,723
Andrew Carver, please

1329
01:56:28,004 --> 01:56:30,336
