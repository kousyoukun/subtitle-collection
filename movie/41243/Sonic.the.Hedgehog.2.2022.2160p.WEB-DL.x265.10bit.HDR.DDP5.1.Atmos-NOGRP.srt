00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,636
（蘑菇星球）

2
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,569
博士日志
Doctor's log.

3
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,155
今天是我第243天的
It's day 243 in this...

4
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,033
蘑菇炼狱生活
portobello purgatory.

5
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,244
只有这颗叫石东的石头陪着我
My only companion is a rock I named Stone.

6
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:06,168
但问题是… 我在跟谁说话
The question is, for whom am I narrating this?

7
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,757
我好像变成了一出荒诞剧 当中的特别来宾
<i>It seems I've become a featured player in the theater of the absurd.</i>

8
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,135
可怜的我被蓝色啮齿动物 困在太空中
<i>Marooned in deep space by that wretched blue rodent.</i>

9
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:19,598
但是很好多亏了能够呼吸的气层 还有我的超凡智慧
<i>But it's all good,</i>

10
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:19,207
<i>thanks to a breathable atmosphere and my supreme intellect,</i>

11
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,935
我在面对唯一够格的竞争对手 就能更敏锐
<i>sharpened against the only competitor savvy enough to bring it.</i>

12
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:24,520
鸡油菇到Ｄ4
Chanterelle to d4. Mmm.

13
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:28,774
我几乎每天都在努力调配出最完美的饮料
<i>I've been striving to make fungi into a functional drink of choice...</i>

14
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,317
蘑菇咖啡
Mushroom coffee.

15
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,446
还是不够好
<i>With limited...</i>

16
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:36,990
不够好… 好恶
<i>limited...</i>

17
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,202
不够好
<i>limited...</i>

18
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,246
成功了
<i>success.</i>

19
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:48,502
但今天是第243天
<i>But today, day 243,</i>

20
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,839
我迫切努力的结果终于有了新的进展
<i>has brought a new optimism to my most pressing endeavor...</i>

21
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:56,635
也就是：我要逃出这颗星球 打爆蓝色啮齿动物
<i>Planetus exodus to returnicus and kick blue butticus.</i>

22
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,394
如果我的计算都正确
If my calculations are correct,

23
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:08,021
其实没理由说“如果”，因为总是正确
and there's no reason to say "if" because they always are...

24
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:13,318
这根尖刺即将给予我的杰作能量
this quill is going to power my masterpiece.

25
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,989
我们点亮这根蜡烛
Let's light this candle...

26
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,367
看看有谁会来敲门
and see who comes a-knockin'.

27
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,310
你们好
Greetings!

28
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,109

<i>Klaatu barada nikto.</i>

29
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,789
石东探员，出击
Agent Stone? Now!

30
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,008
嘿，石东
Thank you, Stone.

31
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:06,682
我们就在这里分别吧 这颗菇里菇怪的星球
It's time to say goodbye to this piece-of-shiitake planet!

32
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:17,985
Huh?

33
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:33,625
你从哪里拿的？
Where did you get that?

34
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,132
从地球上的一个蓝色屁孩那里拿的
From a little blue menace on the planet called Earth.

35
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:44,928
我非常乐意帮你带路
I'd be happy to show you the way.

36
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,312
《音速小子2》

37
00:05:56,356 --> 00:06:01,111
（西雅图）

38
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:09,569
Oh.

39
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:20,881
他们追上来了
They're still on us.

40
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:23,091
这可以拖住警察
This'll slow 'em down.

41
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,302
<i>? This speech is my recital I think it's very vital ?</i>

42
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:43,037
<i>? To rock a rhyme That's right on time ?</i>

43
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,206
<i>? "It's Tricky" is the title Here we go ?</i>

44
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:47,575
<i>? It's tricky to rock a rhyme To rock a rhyme ?</i>

45
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,210
<i>? That's right on time It's tricky ?</i>

46
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:51,787
小心，不好意思，抱歉，借过一下
Watch out. Excuse me. Pardon me. Coming through.

47
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,457
各位先生晚安，让我驾驶好吗？
Good evening, gentlemen. Mind if I drive?

48
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,336
安全带系好
Better buckle up.

49
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,846
后面乘客还好吗？
How we doing back there?

50
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:11,139
现在往左边
And now this way.

51
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:16,937
Whoo-hoo!

52
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,985
不好意思，我听不懂胶带语
Oh, I'm sorry. I don't speak duct tape.

53
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,071
-你有什么毛病？ -别惊慌，小市民
What the heck are you? Fear not, citizen.

54
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:30,158
我这位英雄是你需要而且值得拥有的
I am the hero you need and the hero you deserve.

55
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,703
能够驱逐黑暗深处的蓝色…
The blue dawn that banishes the darkest...

56
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:34,288
Holy crap!

57
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,711
别担心，保证不会有人受伤
Don't worry.

58
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,861
Nobody's gonna get hurt.

59
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,467
-这什么？ -炸弹…那是炸弹
Huh. What are those? Bombs. Bombs.

60
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:49,052
全都是炸弹
They're bombs! Those are bombs!

61
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,305
放轻松，又还没被点燃
Relax. They're not even lit.

62
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,224
我再说一次，保证不会有人…
So I'll say again, nobody's gonna get...

63
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,811
我错了，我们都死定了
I was wrong! We're all gonna die!

64
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,773
你为什么不停下来？
Why aren't you slowing down?

65
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:03,609
因为停下来需要x车
That would require brakes.

66
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:08,363
好烫，烫烫烫…
Oh, it's hot. Hot, hot, hot!

67
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,157
为什么不叫警察处理炸弹？
Why don't you just let the police handle this?

68
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,202
因为呢，这样不是英雄的作风
Because that's not what heroes do.

69
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:19,166
非常感谢各位，掌声请留到最后
Thank you very much. Please hold your applause.

70
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,923
听到没？还有一颗炸弹
Do you hear that? There's one bomb left.

71
00:08:26,407 --> 00:08:28,542
Uh... Uh-oh.

72
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,386
-你在检查座位吗？ -我当然是在检查座位
Did you check under the seat?

73
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:31,779
Of course I checked under the seat!

74
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:34,972
你真的有够逊的
You are terrible at this!

75
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:37,976
说真的，你态度这么消极 根本帮不上什么忙
You know what? Your negative attitude is not helping anyone.

76
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:40,020
它卡在你的尖刺里面
It's in your spiky things!

77
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,690
里面的东西我绝对找不到
Ha! I can never find anything in here.

78
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:47,653
我投了三分球
Drained it from downtown!

79
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:51,323
看吧？我说了不会有人受伤
See? I told you nobody would get hurt.

80
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:55,702
天哪，要冰斗啦
Holy sherbet!

81
00:08:57,788 --> 00:08:58,956
哈，别慌张
Oh, hello.

82
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,750
这只是一把电钻
Don't panic. This is only a drill.

83
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:47,880
不需要感谢我，市民们
Come here!

84
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:47,722
No need to thank me, citizens.

85
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:50,340
这只是属于蓝色正义的
All in a night's work for...

86
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,885
夜行一善
Blue Justice!

87

You're a terrible hero!

真是的
Oh, come on.

97
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:44,078
Uh-oh. Uh...

98
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,651
（安全的星球）

99
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,122
索尼克
Oh, Sonic.

100
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:05,874
我好想你，长爪
I miss you, Longclaw.

101
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,544
我试着让你骄傲
I'm trying to make you proud.

102
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,640
现在来[一下好了
And now for a little shut-eye.

103
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:27,521
阿吉，你有口臭
Oh! Blech!

104
00:11:25,754 --> 00:11:27,254
Ozzy, morning breath!

105
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,523
索尼克，你还在睡吗？
Sonic. Are you still in bed?

106
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:31,984
你现在应该要去找汤姆，记得吗？
You're supposed to meet Tom, remember?

107
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:37,406
好啦…我醒了…
All right, all right, I'm up! I'm up.

108

谢谢你过来，小子
Thanks for coming out, bud.

111
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:48,500
我觉得我们两个 好像已经很久没有聚一聚了
You know, I feel like you and me,

112
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,542
we haven't had much time together lately.

113
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,213
你那边怎么样，有鱼吗？
How's it going over there? You getting any bites?

114
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:02,681
我不会游泳，救命
I can't swim! Help!

115
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,433
如果我死了，不要开我衣橱
If I die, don't look in my closet!

116
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,728
嘿，你没事了…安全了
Hey, hey, you're good. You're all right. Come on.

117
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,939
-好冷 -没事，好啦…放轻松
It's freezing.

118
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:10,799
All right, okay. Take it easy.

119

好啦，没事了，好吗
All right. You're good. Okay.

But now that you've had a nap and a bath...

快点离开这里
<i>I'm so embarrassed. Get out of here quick!</i>

完了，又一波要来了
<i>Oh, no, here comes another one!</i>

128
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:44,681
快点，离开，救救你自己
<i>Go. Now. Save yourself.</i>

129
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:46,141
别过来，这只小刺猬
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop right there. I wouldn't come any closer,</i>

130

-这种事你想重复几遍？ -什么事？
How many times are we gonna do this?

137
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,992
放长线却没有钓到鱼？重复十亿遍吧
What? Cast your line and not catch anything? Seems like a billion.

138
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:05,911
你应该知道我在说什么
I think you know what I'm talking about.

00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,236
Whatever. You're being reckless.

143
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,629
怎么又要老调重弹
Ugh! Not this conversation again.

144
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,506
嘿…我也很不想
Hey. It's no fun for me, either.

145
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:20,300
可是如果你继续不负责任 就只能跟你老调重弹
But if you keep being irresponsible,

146
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:20,339
we're gonna keep having this conversation.

147
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:22,427
我运用自己的力量怎么会不负责任？
How is it irresponsible to use my powers?

148
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:25,556
索尼克，你把一整个城市街区都毁掉了
Sonic, you destroyed an entire city block!

149
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:28,559
那条街本来就年久失修，谁在乎
That block was already messed up.

150
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:32,187
你看，我阻止了一桩抢案，我可是英雄
Who cares?

151
00:13:28,442 --> 00:13:31,813
Look, I stopped a robbery. I was a hero.

152
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:35,190
不，你让大家身陷危险 这不是英雄的作为
No, you put people in danger and that's not what a hero does.

153
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:40,237
你应该是我的朋友
You're supposed to be my friend.

154
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,155
而不是说教的老爹
Stop trying to be my dad.

155
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:49,079
我可以照顾好我自己
I can take care of myself.

156
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:53,750
索尼克，照顾好你自己 跟是不是英雄没关系
Sonic, taking care of yourself

157
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,467
is not what being a hero's all about.

158
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,919
为了别人负起责任才是英雄
It's about taking responsibility for other people.

159
00:13:57,254 --> 00:14:00,340
但现在不管你想不想听 你都还只是个孩子
And right now, whether you want to hear this or not,

160
00:13:58,973 --> 00:14:00,140
you are still just a kid.

161
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:04,761
在你准备好成为大英雄之前 你还有很多的成长空间
You got some more growing up to do

162
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:04,779
before you're ready to be the big hero.

163
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:07,181
相信我说的话
But trust me when I tell you,

164
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:09,725
将来一定有需要你力量的时刻
there will come a time when your powers will be needed.

165
00:14:11,602 --> 00:14:13,562
但不是由你选择时刻
But you don't choose that moment.

166
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:16,315
是那个时刻选择你
That moment chooses you.

167
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:19,126
Whoa. Look at you.

168
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,318
你看看你，再看看我
Look at that. I just got goose bumps.

169
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:21,695
我都起鸡皮疙瘩了

170
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:23,989
先等一下，你抄欧普拉的吗？
Wait a second. Did you steal that from Oprah?

171
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,450
并不是，这是华卓斯基家的格言
No, sir. That is a Wachowski family special.

172
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:31,038
我爸告诉我的 刚好在这座湖，还有这艘船上
Came from my dad,

173
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:31,005
in this very boat, on this very lake.

174
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:34,958
他总是引导我到正确的方向
He would always try and steer me in the right direction.

175
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,836
我跟麦蒂也想要这样引导你
And that's what Maddie and I have always tried to do with you.

176
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:42,132
所以在那一刻来临之前
So, until your moment arrives,

177
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:45,761
我希望你能够更有责任感
I want you to work on being a little more responsible.

178
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:48,305
了解吗？
<i>Comprende?</i>

179
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,349
了解
<i>Comprende.</i>

180
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,434
来击个掌
High five on it.

181
00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:56,688
甜甜圈大王跟蓝旋风强势回归
Yeah! Donut Lord and the Blue Blur are back at it again!

182
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,898
坐稳
Hang on.

183
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,566
机动船
Speedboat!

184
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:01,435

186
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:06,640
Whoo-hoo!

187
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:10,786
跟我一起去夏威夷你会有多开心
How excited are you, going to Hawaii with me? Oh, Hawaii.

188
00:15:10,845 --> 00:15:12,880
Oh, yeah!

189
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:15,382
Wow.

190
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:18,836
欢迎搭乘音速航空，最快的旅游方式
Welcome to Sonic Air, the fastest way to travel.

191
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,295
现在请第一、第二团登机
Now boarding groups one and two.

192
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,689
Oh!

193
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,384
索尼克，这也太有趣了
Sonic, this is so fun!

194
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:27,719
抱歉了小姐，你是第三团的 请等待叫号
I'm sorry, ma'am, you're group three. Please wait your turn.

195
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:31,306
-还有第一、第二团的吗？没人？ -你就让他把流程走完
Anyone from groups one and two?

196
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,229
Just let him get it out of his system. Nobody?

197
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,559
好的，其他的乘客请往这边走
Okay, then everybody else right this way.

198
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:35,310
谢谢
Thank you.

199
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:41,358
换你，先生
And you, sir?

200
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:44,528
侦测到俗气的衬衫
Terrible shirt detected.

201
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:45,612
搞定
There we go.

202
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:49,157
好的，你们可以走了 旅途愉快，两位掰掰
Okay, you're free to go. Enjoy your trip.

203
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:49,182
Bye-bye now.

204
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:50,993
好吧
Okay.

205
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:52,911
抱一个
Bring it in.

206
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:56,164
汤姆，这是我第一次即将担任一家之猬
Tom, I'm about to be hedgehog of the house for the first time.

207
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:58,584
如果拥抱来道别，感觉有点幼稚
I think I'm a little mature to hug you goodbye.

208
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,586
好吧，那击个拳怎么样
Okay, what about a power bump? Power bump?

209
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:02,963
-击个拳？ -好耶，击个拳
Yes, power bump.

210
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,715
这个感觉不错
That's more like it.

211
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,008
华卓斯基
Wachowski!

212
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:08,594
拿好，回家的时候用这一枚
Okay, use this one to get back home.

213
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,337
Oh!

214
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:13,140
好的，先走啦，好好看家
All right, we're off. Be good.

215
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:15,100
对，记得保持联络
Yes. You have our number.

216
00:16:15,184 --> 00:16:17,936
抱歉，我听不到 你们已经穿越跨次元通道了
Sorry! Can't hear you! You're traveling through a cross-dimensional portal!

217
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,438
-我会想你的 -可以J
Miss you already! Okay?

218
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:21,106
瑞秋的婚礼好好玩哦

219
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:25,027
好的，他们回来前有48小时
Okay, it's 48 hours until they come back.

220
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:29,072
我们有电视节目、串流节目 满屋子的食物，而且没人监督
We've got TV channels, streaming channels,

221
00:16:26,721 --> 00:16:28,655
a house full of food and no supervision.

222
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,575
准备嗨起来
Let's do this.

223
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:37,799
<i>? Na-na-na-na ?</i>

228
00:16:46,808 --> 00:16:49,777

229
00:16:49,911 --> 00:16:54,648
<i>? Extraordinary Juice like a strawberry ?</i>

230
00:16:54,782 --> 00:16:58,953
<i>? Money to burn, baby All of the time ?</i>

231
00:16:59,087 --> 00:17:01,655
<i>? Cut to fit is me ?</i>

232
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:04,357
<i>? Fit to cut is she ?</i>

233
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:07,795
<i>? Come juggle with me I say every time ?</i>

234
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:10,064
<i>? Here comes the hotstepper Murderer ?</i>

235
00:17:10,198 --> 00:17:12,532
<i>? I'm the lyrical gangster Murderer ?</i>

236
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,769
<i>? Dial emergency number Murderer ?</i>

237

00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:19,874
<i>? Nah, na-na-na-nah ?</i>

239
00:17:20,007 --> 00:17:22,076
<i>? Na-na-na-na, na-na-na Na-na-na ?</i>

242
00:17:28,149 --> 00:17:29,616

249
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:02,291
如果这些数据没有错
If these readings are accurate, he's here.

250
00:18:02,374 --> 00:18:03,500
那么他就在这里
I found him!

251
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:05,711
希望我没有来晚了
I just hope I'm not too late.

252
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:25,189
很接近了
Hmm. He's close.

253
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:27,608
必须在不被看到的情况下接近他
I just need a way to reach him without being spotted.

254
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:32,446
标准的人类运输工具，完美
Standard human transport. Perfect.

255
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:34,347
<i>? This is how we do it ?</i>

256
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:41,388
<i>? This is how we do it ?</i>

257
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:44,499
（甜甜圈老大）
<i>? It's Friday night ?</i>

258
00:18:43,057 --> 00:18:44,324
Uh-oh.

259
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,027
Oh, boy.

260
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:52,633
阿哈
<i>Aloha!</i>

261
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:54,801
-小子，你还好吗？ -你t
<i>- How's it going, bud? - Oh, you know.</i>

262
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:57,971
这是个宁静的夜晚，我宅在家里读好书
Just a quiet night at home, settling in with a good book.

263
00:18:58,055 --> 00:19:00,933
-你呢？那边怎么样 -我们刚到夏威夷
<i>And you? What's up with you?</i>

264
00:18:59,106 --> 00:19:00,842
I was just calling to say we're here.

265
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:03,435
不过你目前说的每个字都非常可疑
<i>But now every word out of your mouth is making me suspicious.</i>

266
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:04,561
会吗
What? You got to relax, buddy. You're at the Four Seasons Oahu.

267
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:08,774
麻烦放轻松点，帅哥 你人在欧胡岛的四季酒店耶

268
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:11,276
点一杯迈泰，再好好陪陪你太太
Have a Mai Tai. Enjoy some time with your wife.

269
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,195
羞羞的地方让太阳晒一晒
Get sunburned somewhere embarrassing.

270
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:15,697
周末就应该享受一番
<i>This weekend is about you.</i>

271
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:18,367
说的对，那好吧，我们都击过拳了
You know what? You're right. We power-bumped on it.

272
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,868
不管你在做什么
So whatever it is you're doing,

273
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:22,454
我相信你会在我们回家前 整个复原对吧？
I'm sure you can undo it by the time we get home, yeah?

274
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:27,167
当然，我是说，你刚才对我的指控 未免太侮辱人了
<i>Exactly! I mean, I am deeply offended by such accusations!</i>

275
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:28,961
瑞秋她的未婚夫怎么样？
<i>So, how's Rachel's fiancé?</i>

276
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:32,130
本人是不是就跟照片上一样好看？
<i>Is he as good-looking in person as he is in pictures?</i>

277
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:33,373
Hey, baby.

278
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:35,592
好像更好看
Somehow better-looking.

279
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:38,554
那你会是我们家族当第三好看的家伙
<i>Wow! You're about to be the third best-looking dude in the family.</i>

280
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:40,472
但还是能站上颁奖台
<i>But, hey, still on the podium.</i>

281
00:19:40,348 --> 00:19:41,615
Ha-ha-ha.

282
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:44,101
好啦，我先去自我介绍一下
All right, I better go and introduce myself.

283
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,144
别惹麻烦喔
<i>Stay out of trouble.</i>

284
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:50,691
麻烦？别担心，这里的一切都正常到不行
Trouble? Don't worry.

285
00:19:47,788 --> 00:19:50,490
Everything here is completely normal.

286
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:52,234
晚安兄弟
Uh-huh. Night, bud.

287
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:55,112
嗨，我刚好要来打招呼
Hey! I was just coming over to say hi.

288
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,948
你对我未婚妻做了那些事之后 居然还有胆子来
You've got a lot of nerve coming up in here

289
00:19:56,764 --> 00:19:59,166
after what you did to my fiancée.

290
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,076
-什么？ -你毁了她的车
Wait. What? Totaling her car?

291
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:04,329
还把她绑在椅子上，小心被我断手断脚
Leaving her tied to a chair?

292
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:04,205
I should rip you limb from limb.

293
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,252
我的天，看看你的表情
Oh, my God, look at your face!

294
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:12,254
深呼吸，阿汤弟，开玩笑的
Tommy, breathe, baby. Breathe. I was kidding.

295
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:14,256
-老弟，刚都是开玩笑的 -好吧
Hey, man, I was totally kidding. Okay.

296
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:17,843
-是玩笑啊 -对
You were kidding. Yeah.

297
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:20,762
很抱歉，瑞秋要我耍你，我觉得很抱歉
I'm sorry. Rachel put me up to it.

298
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,122
It was totally her idea.

299
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:22,639
真淘气
That rascal.

300
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:26,852
听着，你可能没感觉，瑞秋她不太喜欢你
Listen, I don't know if you're aware.

301
00:20:25,126 --> 00:20:27,427
Rachel does not care for you at all.

302
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:28,937
我知道，对
Oh, I'm aware. Yeah.

303
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:31,690
说真的，老弟，要再加油
Seriously, bro, you got work to do.

304
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:33,233
-好久不见 -是啊
Hey! Hey.

305
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:35,611
谢谢你来，汤姆
Good to see you! Thanks for coming, Tom.

306
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:37,738
-很高兴你能来 -真的？
Really glad you came. Really?

307
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:41,742
我也很高兴见到你，恭喜你们
Uh...

308
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:41,541
Great to see you, too. Congratulations.

309
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:44,286
你们两个在一起看起来真的很幸福
I mean, you guys seem really happy together.

310
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:45,954
你人不错，托马斯华卓斯基
You know, you're all right, Thomas Wachowski.

311
00:20:46,047 --> 00:20:47,047
Ah.

312
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:50,250
-以前的事一笔勾销？ -这样当然好
Can we Bury the hatchet?

313
00:20:48,716 --> 00:20:50,151
I'd love that.

314
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:51,835
-真的？ -真的
Yeah? Yeah.

315
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,379
-很好，来抱一个 -好啊，太好了
All right, bring it in! All right! Great.

316
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:57,758
如果你毁了我的婚礼，我会要你好看
Oh. And if you screw up my wedding, I will end you.

317
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:04,723
好的，阿吉，今晚是索尼克家庭电影夜
All right, Ozzy, it's movie night at Casa de Sonic,

318
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:06,058
轮到你挑电影
and it's your turn to pick.

319
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:08,685
可是先说，我拒绝再看《冰狗任务》
<i>But I am not watching Snow Dogs again.</i>

320
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:11,438
那一部烂到爆
That movie is the worst!

321
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:15,651
停电了
Blackout!

322
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,196
阿吉
Ozzy!

323
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:21,448
老弟抱歉，不会有事的
Oh, sorry, buddy. Everything's okay.

324
00:21:22,582 --> 00:21:23,985
Whoa!

325
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:31,625
不好意思，我们没有点魔神仔喔
Uh, excuse me. We did not order a poltergeist.

326
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:45,472
如果是披萨外送员，那也未免太不专业了
Um, if this is the pizza guy, this is really unprofessional.

327
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:04,575
你是蛋头
Eggman?

328
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,039
哈，刺猬
Hello, hedgehog.

329
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:13,625
你想念我吗？
Did you miss me?

330
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:19,339
不知道你是怎么回来的 但肯定的是，你来到这里真是大错特错
I don't know how you got back,

331
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:19,240
but you made a big mistake coming here.

332
00:22:19,423 --> 00:22:22,259
正好相反，兄弟（法语）
<i>Au contraire, mon frère.</i>

333
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:25,304
你以为赢了才大错特错
The mistake was thinking you'd won.

334
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:27,848
这一切都只是序曲、开胃小菜
But that was just a prelude, an hors d'oeuvre,

335
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:30,100
或是餐前酒、饭前小点心…
an aperitif, an amuse-bouche.

336
00:22:30,184 --> 00:22:31,476
我懂啦
I get it.

337
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:34,605
我可不那么认为
I don't think you do.

338
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:36,607
你很快就懂了
But you're about to.

339
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,234
包含那个笨蛋警长跟他的太太
And so will that idiot sheriff and his wife.

340
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,363
还有你的那一只小狗
And your little dog too!

341
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:03,717
真可悲
Pitiful.

342
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,428
什么？你是谁？
What? Who are you?

343
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:10,599
我真没礼貌
Where are my manners?

344
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:14,686
索尼克，见过纳克鲁斯
Sonic, meet Knuckles.

345
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,980
我的新天地好友
My new BFFAE.

346
00:23:17,064 --> 00:23:20,442
就是我新的天长地久好朋友
Bestest friend forever and ever!

347
00:23:20,526 --> 00:23:23,654
蛋头博士，我不管你找了谁来帮忙
Look, Robotnik, I don't care who you brought to help you.

348
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:25,572
你绝对不可能拿走我的力量
You're never going to get my power.

349
00:23:25,656 --> 00:23:28,242
我看起来像需要你的力量吗？
Do I look like I need your power?

350
00:23:38,794 --> 00:23:43,006
真的跟我预期的一样邪恶又非常的凶狠
So nice when diabolical evil lives up to the hype.

351
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:47,344
你的实力呢？
Where is it?

352
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:50,472
你想看啊，就让你见识
Oh, you want it? Here it comes.

353
00:23:50,556 --> 00:23:55,185
我原本抱更高的期待
I was expecting more of you.

354
00:23:53,801 --> 00:23:55,236
You're unskilled.

355
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:57,312
但你不学无术、不经琢磨
Untrained.

356
00:23:58,856 --> 00:24:01,191
而且不成气候
And unworthy!

357
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:06,196
你忘了一个，我不屈不挠
You forgot one. Unstoppable.

358
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:35,976
我的使命就是完成我的祖先 还没达成的任务
It is my destiny to do what my ancestors could not...

359
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:40,230
把这股终极的力量带回我的家园
To restore the ultimate power to the home of my people.

360
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:44,776
终极的力量？我不知道你在说什么
Ultimate power?

361
00:24:42,283 --> 00:24:44,618
I don't know what you're talking about.

362
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,069
你找错对象了
You've got the wrong guy.

363
00:24:46,153 --> 00:24:48,322
终极的力量？
Ultimate power?

364
00:24:48,822 --> 00:24:51,617
原来这位是同道中人
Now you're speaking my language.

365
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,870
少在那边跟我装傻，长爪的徒弟
Don't play dumb with me, apprentice of Longclaw.

366
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:56,413
你认识长爪？
You knew Longclaw?

367
00:24:56,496 --> 00:25:00,626
长爪跟她的族人 是我的部落针鼹一族的宿敌
Longclaw and her people were the sworn enemy of my tribe, the Echidna.

368
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:05,714
我族光荣战死在他们手上 现在你将死在我手里
We fought and died at their hands,

369
00:25:02,903 --> 00:25:05,573
and now you will die at mine.

370
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:18,560
快点上车，我是跟你一伙的
Come on. Get in! I'm on your side.

371
00:25:18,644 --> 00:25:20,562
不好意思，你哪位？
I'm sorry. Who are you?

372
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:23,565
说实在的，我也不在乎
You know what? It doesn't matter.

373
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:28,111
我们快离开，冲冲冲冲…
Get us out of here! Go, go, go!

374
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:33,325
他有狂犬病
Ah! He's gone rabid!

375
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:36,995
好恶，他在舔玻璃？
Gross! Is he licking it?

376
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:39,498
掰啦
See ya!

377
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:41,875
记得要去接种狂犬疫苗，蛋头
Make sure to get your shots, Eggman!

378
00:25:47,181 --> 00:25:49,250
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

379
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:50,918
Whoa!

380
00:25:55,764 --> 00:25:59,434
太好了，能见到你本尊 是我最大的荣幸，索尼克
Wow. Okay. Let me just say

381
00:25:57,224 --> 00:25:59,159
it is an honor to finally meet you, Sonic.

382
00:25:59,518 --> 00:26:01,061
我可以叫你索尼克吗？
Is it okay if I call you Sonic? Everyone calls me Tails.

383
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:03,939
大家都叫我塔尔斯，就是两条尾巴的意思
You're probably wondering why.

384
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:06,358
所以说你有两条尾巴？
Let me guess. Because of the extra tail? That's right!

385
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:08,360
没有错，其实很明显吧？
I should've known you'd get that. Cool.

386
00:26:08,443 --> 00:26:12,155
好喔，所以现在是怎么回事 蛋头回来了？
Also, what is going on? Robotnik's back?

387
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:14,700
还有那个大红怪克里弗又是哪位
And who is Clifford the Big Red Rage Monster?

388
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:17,327
他是纳克鲁斯，是最后一只针鼹
That's Knuckles, the last of the Echidnas

389
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:19,830
是银河系中最危险的战士
and the most dangerous warrior in the galaxy.

390
00:26:19,913 --> 00:26:21,999
他沉迷于寻找王者翡翠
He's obsessed with finding the Master Emerald.

391
00:26:22,082 --> 00:26:24,418
你认真的吗？王者翡翠？
Are you serious? The Master Emerald?

392
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:26,128
王者翡翠，那只不过是床边故事而已
That's just a bedtime story.

393
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:27,629
但他相信那是真的
Well, he believes it's real.

394
00:26:27,713 --> 00:26:30,007
他觉得你就是找到它的关键
And he must think you're the key to finding it.

395
00:26:32,217 --> 00:26:34,052
红灯、红灯，方向盘给我
Red light! Give me the wheel!

396
00:26:34,136 --> 00:26:35,971
-嘿，你这是在… -脚挪开
Hey, what are you... Move your foot.

397
00:26:43,729 --> 00:26:45,022
应该甩掉他了
I think we lost him.

398
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:55,532
我们没有甩掉他，我们真的没有甩掉他
We did not lose him.

399
00:26:53,981 --> 00:26:55,549
We definitely did not lose him!

400
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:02,956
我有一个点子，你相信我吗？
I've got an idea. Do you trust me?

401
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,250
当然不相信，我才刚认识你耶
Of course not! I literally just met you!

402
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:07,419
-拜托让我…拜托 -你在做什么？
Just let me... Come on! What are you doing?

403
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:27,648
我们在飞
We're flying.

404
00:27:28,357 --> 00:27:30,442
你的屁屁怎么变成直升机了？
Uh, did your butt just turn into a helicopter?

405
00:27:30,284 --> 00:27:32,953
A butt-copter!

406
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:33,445
这是屁升机
Oh, only Sonic the Hedgehog could come up with something like that.

407
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:37,366
只有音速小子索尼克，会说出这样的话

408
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:54,475
Foxy move.

409
00:27:52,464 --> 00:27:54,633
好个狐狸尾巴

410
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:57,928
想把事情做好
You want something done right...

411
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:02,224
不如把事情都交给奴才代劳
You have to hire someone you can push around.

412
00:28:04,393 --> 00:28:05,394
惊叹号
All caps.

413
00:28:15,262 --> 00:28:21,435
<i>? I waited till I saw the sun ?</i>

414
00:28:21,568 --> 00:28:23,470
<i>? I don't know why I didn't come ?</i>

415
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,913
博士
Doctor,

416
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:26,957
你在哪里？
where are you?

417
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:34,798
异类
Freak.

418
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:41,805
（帮我准备拿铁）

419
00:28:43,056 --> 00:28:45,350
我…各位顾客抱歉
Oh, I, uh... I'm sorry, folks.

420
00:28:45,434 --> 00:28:47,811
我必须提早打烊，大家快出去
Uh, I have to close early. Everybody out!

421
00:28:47,895 --> 00:28:50,939
大家快出去，谢谢各位光临霸咖
Everybody out. Thank you for visiting the Mean Bean.

422
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:53,108
好的，晚安…
All right, good night. Good night.

423
00:28:53,192 --> 00:28:55,194
（营业中）

424
00:28:55,277 --> 00:28:56,320
（休息中）

425
00:28:56,403 --> 00:28:57,863
（卫生检查A级…F级）

426
00:29:12,294 --> 00:29:13,337
他回来了
He's back.

427
00:29:15,047 --> 00:29:17,049
他回来了
He's back!

428
00:30:11,812 --> 00:30:14,064
这样子才象话嘛
That's more like it.

429
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:17,860
我已经浴壳重生
I've been re-hatched!

430
00:30:29,413 --> 00:30:33,959
那么我这位豪大拳头好朋友
So, my massively metacarpaled friend,

431
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:35,377
你提过…
you mentioned...

432
00:30:37,254 --> 00:30:39,256
终极的力量
Ultimate power.

433
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:40,340
那是什么？
Back at the house?

434
00:30:40,424 --> 00:30:42,050
王者翡翠
The Master Emerald?

435
00:30:42,134 --> 00:30:43,510
这些跟你没关系
It does not concern you.

436
00:30:43,594 --> 00:30:46,597
我带你离开星球，你带我来找那只刺猬
I got you off that planet and you brought me to the hedgehog.

437
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,765
我们已经不需要互相利用了
We have no more use for each other.

438
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:51,185
我很不喜欢唱反调，但是…
Well, I hate to be a contrarian, but...

439
00:30:52,102 --> 00:30:53,228
还是有需要
I think we might.

440
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:57,191
你以为这些机器打得过我？
You think these machines are a match for me?

441
00:30:57,274 --> 00:31:00,736
我会把它们像肋骨一样 拆成一根一根的…
I will shatter them like the bones from a fallen...

442
00:31:01,612 --> 00:31:02,738
它们是阶梯
Oh, they are stairs.

443
00:31:08,452 --> 00:31:12,623
你知道地球是我的地盘对吧
You see, Earth is my turf, G.

444
00:31:13,123 --> 00:31:15,876
如果你不会用牙线，肯定会走偏
If you don't know how to floss, you'll be lost without me.

445
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:18,504
我听不懂你这句话是什么意思
I understand nothing of what you just said.

446
00:31:18,587 --> 00:31:22,966
我会帮你取回那颗翡翠 你再利用它，把…
I help you retrieve the Emerald, and you use it to...

447
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:29,389
那只刺猬消灭
destroy the hedgehog!

448
00:31:29,973 --> 00:31:31,683
你是想要跟我结盟吧
You're suggesting an alliance.

449
00:31:31,767 --> 00:31:35,896
我们这的习惯是互相握手表示结盟
Around here we simply grip each other's hands tightly.

450
00:31:36,764 --> 00:31:39,533
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

451
00:31:41,276 --> 00:31:44,905
你…这颗暴走的太空南瓜
You truculent space bumpkin!

452
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:47,157
你捏坏我最喜欢的手
You've crushed my favorite hand!

453
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:49,743
是吗？我的手没有怎样
Really? My hand is uninjured.

454
00:31:50,953 --> 00:31:53,205
不过我对你的承诺深信不疑
Ugh.

455
00:31:50,979 --> 00:31:53,047
But I'm now convinced of your commitment.

456
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:55,207
赞赞
"Oh, goody,"

457
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:58,794
他一边乔着关节一边说着话
he exclaimed, while he reset two of his knuckles.

458
00:31:58,853 --> 00:32:01,055
I'm...

459
00:32:01,296 --> 00:32:06,218
我很高兴我们愿意在同一队
delighted to be on the same team.

460
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:15,435
公路旅行
Road trip!

461
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:18,063
我可以让你把头伸出窗外
I'll let you stick your nose out the window.

462
00:32:20,274 --> 00:32:22,025
索尼克，我们在哪里？
Uh, Sonic, where are we?

463
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:24,486
欢迎来到韦德的洞穴
Welcome to the Wade Cave.

464
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:27,614
我原本想在有一天能对某位女人说的
Which is something I hope to someday say to a woman.

465
00:32:27,698 --> 00:32:29,366
是我妈以外的女人
A woman who's not my mom.

466
00:32:29,449 --> 00:32:31,410
韦德，专心一点
Wade, focus.

467
00:32:31,493 --> 00:32:35,205
要弄清楚为什么纳克鲁斯觉得 我是找到王者翡翠的关键
We need to figure out why Knuckles thinks

468
00:32:32,987 --> 00:32:35,056
I'm the key to finding the Master Emerald.

469
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:37,207
还有他为什么会提到长爪？
And why did he mention Longclaw?

470
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:40,043
当中一定有什么关联
There must be a connection.

471
00:32:40,627 --> 00:32:42,045
等一下，我知道了
Wait a minute. There is.

472
00:32:42,588 --> 00:32:46,508
你看，长爪给我的地图上 有一个翡翠的符号
Look. There's an emerald symbol on the map Longclaw gave me.

473
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,468
我以前不知道那是什么
I never knew what it meant before.

474
00:32:49,178 --> 00:32:50,846
好像有什么反应
Something's happening.

475
00:32:50,705 --> 00:32:53,775
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

476
00:33:03,984 --> 00:33:05,360
长爪？
Longclaw?

477
00:33:05,444 --> 00:33:06,987
你好，索尼克，如果你看到这个
Hello, Sonic.

478
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:10,449
就表示我遭遇不测
If you're watching this, then something has happened to me.

479
00:33:10,532 --> 00:33:13,368
我祈祷你已经安全抵达地球
And I pray you've made it to Earth unharmed.

480
00:33:13,869 --> 00:33:18,165
这个世界之所以被选上 有着非常重要的理由
This world has been chosen for a very important reason.

481
00:33:18,248 --> 00:33:21,877
它就是王者翡翠所在的秘密地点
It's the secret location of the Master Emerald.

482
00:33:22,269 --> 00:33:23,738
Whoa.

483
00:33:24,004 --> 00:33:27,633
那颗翡翠的力量就是把想法转变为现实
The Emerald has the power to turn thoughts into reality.

484
00:33:28,133 --> 00:33:30,636
就跟《魔鬼克星》的棉花糖宝宝一样
<i>Like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man from Ghostbusters.</i>

485
00:33:31,386 --> 00:33:35,474
如果在坏人手上 全宇宙的生命将会面临威胁
Shh!

486
00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:32,880
In the wrong hands,

487
00:33:33,014 --> 00:33:35,282
it could threaten all life in the universe.

488
00:33:35,557 --> 00:33:38,477
守护王者翡翠是我的神圣使命
Protecting the Emerald was my sacred duty.

489
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:42,231
现在我必须把这个重大的责任交给你
And now I must pass that responsibility to you.

490
00:33:43,357 --> 00:33:46,026
现在是我的时刻
This is my moment.

491
00:33:46,109 --> 00:33:49,571
跟着地图走，找到翡翠以后把它守护好
Follow the map, find the Emerald, and keep it safe.

492
00:33:50,197 --> 00:33:51,740
亲爱的索尼克
My dear Sonic,

493
00:33:51,823 --> 00:33:54,785
你的心是我见过最善良的
you have a heart like no creature I've ever known.

494
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,079
我真的很爱你
I love you so much.

495
00:33:58,747 --> 00:33:59,957
再见
Goodbye.

496
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:03,126
不不…等等
No, no, wait.

497
00:34:10,259 --> 00:34:12,135
我不会让你失望，长爪
I won't let you down, Longclaw.

498
00:34:14,096 --> 00:34:17,224
刚才那位…是你爸？
So is that y-your dad?

499
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:18,766
什么？
What?

500
00:34:18,851 --> 00:34:19,851
不是？
No?

501
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:23,438
这张地图显示，第一条线索在西伯利亚
According to this map,

502
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:23,064
the first clue is in Siberia.

503
00:34:23,522 --> 00:34:25,815
这是个能找到翡翠的罗盘
It's a compass that will lead to the Emerald.

504
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:28,819
而且纳克鲁斯也来到地球，必须分秒必争
And with Knuckles already here, it's a race.

505
00:34:28,902 --> 00:34:29,902
纳克鲁斯？
Knuckles?

506
00:34:30,654 --> 00:34:32,447
我高中的时候也认识一个纳克鲁斯
I knew a kid in middle school named Knuckles.

507
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:34,366
他可以吞下自己的拳头
Could fit his whole fist in his mouth.

508
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:38,579
如果他们是同个纳克鲁斯，我们就完蛋了
If this is the same Knuckles...

509
00:34:36,343 --> 00:34:38,179
...we are screwed.

510
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:41,081
你说的这两个纳克鲁斯都不是重点
This Knuckles, that Knuckles. It doesn't matter.

511
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:42,833
我们要先抢先赢
We're gonna get there first.

512
00:34:45,835 --> 00:34:47,588
你说的“我们”代表…
What do you mean, "we"?

513
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,964
就代表你跟我
You're coming with me.

514
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:50,382
不不不…
Oh, no, no, no.

515
00:34:50,465 --> 00:34:53,677
我只是来这里警告你，我不是个外勤咖
I just came here to warn you. I'm not a field guy.

516
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,556
别担心，我会罩你的 我保证不会让你出事
Don't worry. I got your back.

517
00:34:55,428 --> 00:34:57,664
I won't let anything happen to you.

518
00:34:59,016 --> 00:35:02,769
这叫击个拳 地球上代表着坚不可摧的承诺
It's a power bump.

519
00:35:00,101 --> 00:35:02,737
On Earth, it means an unbreakable promise.

520
00:35:02,853 --> 00:35:05,564
好吧，我加入
Okay, I'm in.

521
00:35:08,209 --> 00:35:12,880
<i>? Me and you Maybe sunshine, maybe rain ?</i>

522
00:35:21,288 --> 00:35:23,665
博士，真的是你
Doctor. It's really you.

523
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:26,126
你看起来很不同
You look different.

524
00:35:26,752 --> 00:35:29,421
因为老爸留了新的胡子
Papa's got a brand new 'stache.

525
00:35:30,264 --> 00:35:31,498
Ha!

526
00:35:32,549 --> 00:35:36,178
就知道，我就知道，我就知道你会回来
I knew it. I knew it!

527
00:35:34,202 --> 00:35:35,870
I knew you'd come back, sir.

528
00:35:36,261 --> 00:35:38,680
所以一直准备着奥地利山羊奶
I never stopped steaming your Austrian goat's milk.

529
00:35:44,603 --> 00:35:45,938
再加一点蘑菇
Could use some mushroom.

530
00:35:47,814 --> 00:35:48,982
你带回来，像是某一种…
You brought something.

531
00:35:49,733 --> 00:35:52,528
太空的豪猪
Some kind of, uh, space porcupine.

532
00:35:53,028 --> 00:35:56,031
什么豪猪？我可是一只针鼹
Porcupine? I am an Echidna!

533
00:35:56,114 --> 00:35:58,700
一出生就接受各种致命武术训练
Trained since birth in all forms of lethal combat,

534
00:35:58,784 --> 00:36:00,994
致力于恢复我族的荣耀
destined to restore honor to my tribe,

535
00:36:01,078 --> 00:36:04,873
如果敢挡我的路，就等着被我消灭
and willing to destroy anything that gets in my way.

536
00:36:05,499 --> 00:36:06,875
欢迎你的加入
Welcome to the team.

537
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:15,008
这表示他相信你，石东
That means he trusts you, Stone.

538
00:36:15,634 --> 00:36:18,345
我们来改造这座垃圾堆
Now let's renovate this dump!

539
00:36:19,012 --> 00:36:21,348
来一杯奥地利山羊奶拿铁
Latte with steamed Austrian goat milk!

540
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,911
好球，赞喔
Good one. Solid.

541
00:36:50,127 --> 00:36:51,461
抱歉，各位
- Sorry, fellas. - That's game!

542
00:36:52,588 --> 00:36:54,214
对，做得很好
Ha! That's how we do! That's how we do!

543
00:36:54,798 --> 00:36:57,176
-那他们数学强吗？ -团队合作让梦想成真
But are they good at math?

544
00:36:55,482 --> 00:36:57,550
Teamwork makes the dream work!

545
00:36:57,801 --> 00:36:59,136
不好意思，阿汤
Sorry about that, Big Tom.

546
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:01,805
-你还好吗？ -没事，很好
Are you good? All good. Fine.

547
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:04,933
嘿，谢谢你邀请我过来
Thanks for inviting me out to hang with you and your groomsmen.

548
00:37:05,017 --> 00:37:06,518
跟你的伴郎团打球，联络感情
Good quality bonding.

549
00:37:07,144 --> 00:37:08,312
你懂的
You know, bro,

550
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:10,898
那些家伙其实不只是我的伴郎
those guys right there, they're way more than my groomsmen.

551
00:37:10,981 --> 00:37:12,107
是我死党
That's my squad.

552
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:14,234
要是没他们就没有我
Never would've made it through life without 'em.

553
00:37:14,318 --> 00:37:15,360
赶快过来
Get over here!

554
00:37:15,444 --> 00:37:17,154
好，马上来，我马上来
Yeah, I'm coming! I'm coming!

555
00:37:17,738 --> 00:37:20,449
-晚点见啦 -好
I'll catch you later.

556
00:37:18,538 --> 00:37:20,107
Hey. Yeah!

557
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:22,826
要来力量瑜珈再跟我说一声
Let me know if you're ready for some power yoga, huh?

558
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:25,954
-当然 -加油，阿汤弟，秀出来、秀出来
You bet. Come on, Tommy boy. Let's go.

559
00:37:26,038 --> 00:37:27,080
别逼我
Don't make me.

560
00:37:28,165 --> 00:37:29,249
我在干嘛？
What am I doing?

561
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:30,626
嘿，汤姆姨丈
Hey, Uncle Tommy!

562
00:37:30,709 --> 00:37:32,211
美女们
Hey, girls!

563
00:37:32,294 --> 00:37:35,130
你们两个，噢…这是结婚戒指？
How you do... Oh!

564
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,056
Are those the wedding rings? Uh-huh.

565
00:37:35,714 --> 00:37:36,715
我看看
May I?

566
00:37:36,798 --> 00:37:40,260
这位小戒童非常认真地看待她的任务
This little ring bearer has been taking her job very seriously.

567
00:37:40,344 --> 00:37:42,679
-练习了一整个早上 -我看得出来
She's been practicing all morning.

568
00:37:42,763 --> 00:37:45,140
你是多么有责任感
I can see that.

569
00:37:42,629 --> 00:37:44,865
How very responsible of you.

570
00:37:45,224 --> 00:37:46,892
但应该要有两个才对吧？
Except aren't there supposed to be two wedding rings?

571
00:37:47,435 --> 00:37:49,337
Uh-oh.

572
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:53,315
-汤姆姨丈？ -等等，这里有什么？
Uncle Tommy?

573
00:37:50,637 --> 00:37:53,506
Hang on. What's going on here?

574
00:37:55,734 --> 00:37:56,944
你没问题的，孩子
You're gonna do great, kiddo.

575
00:37:57,027 --> 00:37:58,070
掰
Bye.

576
00:37:58,153 --> 00:37:59,530
-嘿，宝贝 -嗨
Hey, baby. Hi.

577
00:38:02,658 --> 00:38:04,660
就是这样，伴郎团在这里
That's right! Groom in the building!

578
00:38:04,743 --> 00:38:06,203
看看那群家伙
Look at those guys.

579
00:38:06,787 --> 00:38:08,205
希望索尼克也有
I wish Sonic had that.

580
00:38:08,747 --> 00:38:10,958
-肌肉？ -你克制一点，不是
Muscles? Control yourself.

581
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:15,671
是有朋友、伙伴，或是死党，你懂？
Mm-hmm.

582
00:38:11,859 --> 00:38:15,296
No. Buddies. Wingmen. A squad.

583
00:38:15,754 --> 00:38:19,258
索尼克完全没有，他独来独往
Sonic doesn't have anything like that. He's flying solo.

584
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:22,094
宝贝，放轻松一点
Baby, you got to relax.

585
00:38:22,177 --> 00:38:24,388
你人在四季酒店，点一杯迈泰
You're at the Four Seasons.

586
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:27,391
再好好的陪你太太
Have a Mai Tai. Spend some time with your wife.

587
00:38:27,474 --> 00:38:30,561
你跟他说的一样，说真的完全一样
That's what he said. Seriously, his exact words.

588
00:38:30,644 --> 00:38:34,690
看吧？他很聪明 会找到自己的路
See? He's a smart kid. All right.

589
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:34,315
Hmm. He'll find his way.

590
00:38:35,274 --> 00:38:38,360
我现在完完全全找不到自己的路
I absolutely cannot find my way.

591
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:41,780
看来我们两个真的彻彻底底的迷路了
We are completely, totally, unequivocally lost.

592
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,700
索尼克，我的装置在这种天气之下
Sonic, in this weather,

593
00:38:44,783 --> 00:38:47,786
根本就读不到任何数据
there's no way we're gonna get any readings on this thing!

594
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:49,621
-我们要不要回去？ -不不不…
Should we go back?

595
00:38:49,705 --> 00:38:52,958
我看到前面有亮光 也许我们可以过去避一避
No, no, no. There's a light up ahead.

596
00:38:50,831 --> 00:38:53,034
Maybe we can take shelter in there.

597
00:38:56,704 --> 00:38:59,240
Ah. Perfect.

598
00:38:58,547 --> 00:38:59,631
非常完美
Are you sure about this? We don't know who's inside.

599
00:38:59,715 --> 00:39:02,885
你确定要混进去吗？ 我们不知道里面有谁

600
00:39:02,968 --> 00:39:06,221
别担心，地球上的每个人都非常好客
Don't worry. On Earth, people are very welcoming,

601
00:39:06,305 --> 00:39:09,850
而且还很乐意带陌生人回到自己家里面
and love taking complete strangers into their homes.

602
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:40,797
快逃
Run.

603
00:39:43,425 --> 00:39:45,010
总共两位，谢谢
Table for two, please!

604
00:39:47,137 --> 00:39:49,348
你们想点什么？

605
00:39:49,431 --> 00:39:51,141
两份炖牛肉，谢谢
Two beef stews, please.

606
00:39:51,225 --> 00:39:53,185
（翻译中）

607
00:39:56,605 --> 00:39:59,775
-你去哪找到那种酷东西的？ -这个是我发明的
Where'd you get all these cool gadgets?

608
00:39:58,265 --> 00:39:59,567
I invented 'em.

609
00:39:59,858 --> 00:40:01,777
算是我的专长
That's kinda my thing.

610
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,321
其实是我的发明让我找到你的
In fact, my inventions are how I discovered you.

611
00:40:05,155 --> 00:40:07,491
还记得棒球场停电的那晚吗？
<i>Remember that night at the baseball field?</i>

612
00:40:07,574 --> 00:40:11,286
你的能量超巨大，一路暴冲到我的星球
<i>Your energy blast reached all the way to my home planet.</i>

613
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:15,999
我还看见你从那个疯狂胡须男手上 拯救一整个小镇
I saw you save your whole village from that crazy mustache guy.

614
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:19,294
等等，所以你从那时候监视我到现在？
Wait, so you've been watching me this whole time?

615
00:40:19,378 --> 00:40:20,963
冲澡的时候也是？
Even in the shower?

616
00:40:21,046 --> 00:40:22,965
好一个陷阱题
That's a trick question.

617
00:40:23,048 --> 00:40:25,259
音速小子索尼克比较喜欢泡泡浴
Sonic the Hedgehog prefers bubble baths.

618
00:40:25,342 --> 00:40:26,677
你很熟嘛
Man, you're good!

619
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,221
我一知道纳克鲁斯来地球找你
When I learned Knuckles was on your trail,

620
00:40:29,304 --> 00:40:32,140
就知道自己不能再继续坐视不管
I knew I couldn't just sit back and watch anymore.

621
00:40:32,224 --> 00:40:33,684
我一定要来警告你
I had to come warn you.

622
00:40:34,935 --> 00:40:36,603
什么？先等我一下
Oh, what? Hang on one sec.

623
00:40:36,687 --> 00:40:38,272
甜甜圈大王打来了
Donut Lord is checking in.

624
00:40:38,355 --> 00:40:39,815
（都还好吗？）
"Just chilling. Watching TV."

625
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:43,902
“只是在耍废，看着电视”

626
00:40:44,403 --> 00:40:46,154
点点点
Dot, dot, dot.

627
00:40:46,864 --> 00:40:48,991
点点点…
Dot, dot, dot.

628
00:40:49,741 --> 00:40:51,451
点点点…
Dot, dot, dot.

629
00:40:51,535 --> 00:40:53,328
点点点…
Dot, dot, dot.

630
00:40:53,787 --> 00:40:56,924
Dot, dot, dot.

631
00:40:56,999 --> 00:40:58,000
博士
Doctor,

632
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:01,336
为什么要跟这个呆瓜合作？
why are we working with this imbecile?

633
00:41:02,671 --> 00:41:07,259
因为那个头脑简单的太空垃圾 能够找到某个特别的东西
Because that simpleminded space trash is the key to something extraordinary.

634
00:41:08,177 --> 00:41:10,721
某个东西能帮你向刺猬报仇吗
Something to help you get revenge on the hedgehog.

635
00:41:11,221 --> 00:41:12,431
想得远大一点
Think bigger, Stone.

636
00:41:13,015 --> 00:41:16,310
他在找的翡翠能提供最狂的发明能量
The emerald he seeks could power my wildest designs.

637
00:41:16,393 --> 00:41:18,770
我的聪明才智不只被地球人认可
My genius wouldn't just be recognized on Earth.

638
00:41:18,854 --> 00:41:21,815
还要让银河系每种生物都知道
It would spread virally to every corner of the galaxy,

639
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:25,194
我就能够驾驭宇宙里所有的负面力量
allowing me to harness all the negative forces of the universe

640
00:41:25,986 --> 00:41:28,238
还能跟邪恶本身交流
and commune with Darkness itself.

641
00:41:28,322 --> 00:41:30,699
真的很远大
Wow. That sounds big.

642
00:41:31,366 --> 00:41:34,536
这是我多年来的愿景版图，吸引力法则
It's been on my vision board for years. It's the Law of Attraction.

643
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,954
你没读过《秘密》吗
<i>Didn't you see The Secret?</i>

644
00:41:37,289 --> 00:41:39,333
卡噗噜咿
Kaplooey!

645
00:41:39,416 --> 00:41:40,459
卡噗噜咿
Kaplooey.

646
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:43,754
“又一个宅在家的无聊夜晚”
"Another boring night at home."

647
00:41:43,837 --> 00:41:45,839
刺猬回去他家了
The hedgehog has returned home!

648
00:41:45,923 --> 00:41:49,384
Ｆａｌｓａ，拉丁语的意思是“错”
<i>Falsa. Which is Latin for "wrong-o."</i>

649
00:41:50,093 --> 00:41:54,306
我的全球网络通信基地三角测量指出 他在说谎
According to my worldwide network cell tower triangulation, he's lying,

650
00:41:55,015 --> 00:41:56,183
而且呢
all the way

651
00:41:57,184 --> 00:42:01,146
他在广阔的偏远地区，西伯利亚的东边
from the majestic hinterlands of Eastern Siberia.

652
00:42:01,939 --> 00:42:05,150
他是一个远距离的骗子
He's a long-distance liar!

653
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:09,363
Kuh! Kuh! Kuh! Nga-nga-nga-nga-nga!

654
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,865
我看你以后还有得受呢
Yeah, there's more where that came from.

655
00:42:14,368 --> 00:42:16,453
小型魔法刺猬被消灭了
Tiny magic hedgehog destroyed.

656
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:19,873
现在准备去找本尊
Now let's begin our quest.

657
00:42:22,751 --> 00:42:23,919
等等
Wait.

658
00:42:24,002 --> 00:42:26,463
你的奴才怎么办？那个羊奶男
What about your Minion? The goat milker.

659
00:42:27,089 --> 00:42:29,424
船舱里没有多余的空间了
There's no room on the ship for Stone.

660
00:42:29,508 --> 00:42:32,302
我们要抛弃他，要完全忽略他
I say we ditch him, ghost him, blow him off.

661
00:42:32,386 --> 00:42:33,345
太无耻了
Dishonor!

662
00:42:34,763 --> 00:42:37,349
“无”有吾的本色
"Dis" is how I roll.

663
00:42:43,464 --> 00:42:45,065
Ugh!

664
00:42:45,399 --> 00:42:48,443
好恶，不好意思，我点的应该是炖牛肉
Uh, I'm sorry, but I asked for the beef stew.

665
00:42:49,987 --> 00:42:52,197
你的口臭闻起来像羊粪

666
00:42:53,073 --> 00:42:54,700
你说什么？

667
00:42:54,675 --> 00:42:55,876
Uh...

668
00:42:58,495 --> 00:42:59,913
怎么回事？
Uh, what's going on?

669
00:43:00,914 --> 00:43:03,083
他们可能以为我今天生日
Maybe they think it's my birthday?

670
00:43:04,293 --> 00:43:07,838
别担心，让我来处理 好的各位乡亲，不要激动
Don't worry, I'll take care of this.

671
00:43:05,953 --> 00:43:07,655
Okay, everybody, take it easy.

672
00:43:07,921 --> 00:43:09,965
不管我朋友说了或是做了什么
I'm sure there's a perfectly good explanation

673
00:43:10,048 --> 00:43:12,467
我绝对都能给出一个合理的解释
for whatever my friend said or did.

674
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:14,344
退开

675
00:43:14,428 --> 00:43:15,846
我刚放屁

676
00:43:21,226 --> 00:43:22,186
喵？
Uh... meow?

677
00:43:22,603 --> 00:43:24,563
把这两只怪物扔去火烤

678
00:43:28,442 --> 00:43:31,570
不不不不…拜托，各位 冷静一点，我们好好谈
Oh, no, no. Come on, guys.

679
00:43:29,543 --> 00:43:31,478
Take it easy. Let's talk this through.

680
00:43:32,154 --> 00:43:33,322
我们好好谈嘛
Let's talk this through!

681
00:43:34,489 --> 00:43:37,242
快点，搜寻西伯利亚习俗
Come on, come on. Scanning Siberian customs.

682
00:43:37,326 --> 00:43:41,079
-一定能找到些什么 -塔尔斯，不管你做什么，动作快
There's got to be something in here.

683
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,888
Tails, whatever you're doing, do it fast.

684
00:43:41,163 --> 00:43:42,206
我好像知道了
Ooh! I think I got it!

685
00:43:42,289 --> 00:43:44,499
Ｐｉｖｏｎｋａ…
<i>Pivonka! Pivonka!</i>

686
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:46,710
Ｐｉｖｏｎｋａ
<i>Pivonka!</i>

687
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:51,733
<i>Oh? Pivonka?</i>

688
00:43:51,865 --> 00:43:54,902
<i>Pivonka.</i>

689
00:44:14,388 --> 00:44:15,689
<i>Da.</i>

690
00:44:15,824 --> 00:44:16,825
<i>Pivonka!</i>

691
00:44:18,742 --> 00:44:20,953
塔尔斯，什么是“泡网咖”？
<i>Tails, what's a "pivonka"?</i>

692
00:44:21,036 --> 00:44:23,830
它是西伯利亚解决纷争的习俗
It's a Siberian custom to resolve disputes.

693
00:44:23,914 --> 00:44:26,583
如果赢了，我们就能离开，如果输了…
If we win, they let us go. If we lose...

694
00:44:32,089 --> 00:44:35,425
我们必须拿到地图，然后赶快闪 地图在哪？
Okay, we have to grab the map and get out of here. Where's the map?

695
00:44:35,509 --> 00:44:38,178
不会吧，我把它留在桌上了，你看
Oh, no. I left it on the table! Look!

696
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:47,145
什么？
What?

697
00:45:10,294 --> 00:45:13,005
我的天哪，原来是尬舞比赛
Oh, my God, it's a dance fight.

698
00:45:14,423 --> 00:45:16,633
索尼克，我们该怎么办？
Sonic, what do we do?

699
00:45:16,717 --> 00:45:19,011
去跳舞，然后把地图拿走
We dance and get that map.

700
00:45:20,804 --> 00:45:21,972
开始
Here we go.

701
00:45:21,955 --> 00:45:23,624
Ow!

702
00:45:24,641 --> 00:45:26,643
好的，那么接下来…不对，应该要…
Okay, now let's do... No, we're gonna go...

703
00:45:33,984 --> 00:45:34,985
好吧
Ah, okay.

704
00:45:43,952 --> 00:45:47,998
好吧，这下子感觉不太妙 查宁塔图明明跳得超轻松
Okay, this is not going well.

705
00:45:45,446 --> 00:45:47,849
Channing Tatum makes it look so easy.

706
00:45:48,081 --> 00:45:49,625
等等，索尼克，你看
Wait, Sonic. Look!

707
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:54,354
<i>Opa! Opa! Opa!</i>

708
00:45:54,213 --> 00:45:56,340
地图，快点，我们去拿
The map! Come on, let's grab it!

709
00:46:00,427 --> 00:46:01,428
想要吗？
You want?

710
00:46:02,221 --> 00:46:03,847
就过来拿
Come get.

711
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:05,224
异类
Freaks!

712
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:07,309
异类
Freaks!

713
00:46:07,392 --> 00:46:09,770
异类、异类
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!

714
00:46:09,804 --> 00:46:11,873
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!

715
00:46:12,005 --> 00:46:14,041
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!

716
00:46:14,174 --> 00:46:15,609
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!

717
00:46:15,859 --> 00:46:18,529
怎么了？塔尔斯，来啊，我需要你
What's wrong, Tails? Come on. I need you!

718
00:46:18,612 --> 00:46:21,532
我办不到，索尼克，我不像你那么勇敢
I can't do this, Sonic. I'm not brave like you.

719
00:46:21,615 --> 00:46:24,284
我的装备害我们陷入险境，我把地图弄丢
My gadget got us in this mess, and I lost your map,

720
00:46:24,368 --> 00:46:26,411
现在我们还可能会被丢进火里
and we're gonna get tossed into a fire!

721
00:46:29,389 --> 00:46:30,491
Ah...

722
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:33,085
新ＤＪ驾到
New deejay coming in.

723
00:46:36,296 --> 00:46:38,298
来吧伙伴，我有一个点子
Come on, pal. I got an idea.

724
00:46:38,382 --> 00:46:40,092
他们叫我们异类
They called us freaks,

725
00:46:41,093 --> 00:46:42,845
就让他们更讶异
so let's get freaky.

726
00:46:42,928 --> 00:46:45,180
只要跟着我跳，就绝对没问题
Just follow my moves. You'll be fine.

727
00:46:47,374 --> 00:46:49,878
<i>? Doh-doh-doh, doh-doh Aw, ow ?</i>

728
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:51,378
<i>? This hit, that ice cold ?</i>

729
00:46:51,512 --> 00:46:53,480
<i>? Michelle Pfeiffer That white gold ?</i>

730
00:46:53,614 --> 00:46:55,516
<i>? This one for them hood girls ?</i>

731
00:46:55,649 --> 00:46:58,018
<i>? Them good girls Straight masterpieces ?</i>

732
00:46:58,151 --> 00:47:01,588
<i>? Stylin', wilin' Livin' it up in the city ?</i>

733
00:47:01,723 --> 00:47:03,892
<i>? Got Chucks on With Saint Laurent ?</i>

734
00:47:04,024 --> 00:47:05,659
<i>? Gotta kiss myself I'm so pretty ?</i>

735
00:47:05,793 --> 00:47:07,528
<i>? Break it down Girls hit your hallelujah ?</i>

736
00:47:07,661 --> 00:47:10,230
<i>? Whoo Girls hit your hallelujah ?</i>

737
00:47:10,539 --> 00:47:11,957
（复制多重塔尔斯）
<i>? Whoo Girls hit your hallelujah ?</i>

738
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:16,044
很好，您的舞群来
<i>? Whoo ?</i>

739
00:47:13,467 --> 00:47:15,703
All right! Backup dancers!

740
00:47:15,837 --> 00:47:18,639
<i>? 'Cause uptown funk Gon' give it to you ?</i>

741
00:47:18,773 --> 00:47:20,574
<i>? Saturday night And we in the spot ?</i>

742
00:47:20,716 --> 00:47:22,050
一起跳
Here we go!

743
00:47:22,042 --> 00:47:23,644
Oh! Ha!

744
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:28,282
Boom! Ah! Oh!

745
00:47:29,316 --> 00:47:31,685
<i>? Don't believe me Just watch ?</i>

746
00:47:31,819 --> 00:47:34,354
Whoa!

747
00:47:36,423 --> 00:47:38,458
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

748
00:47:43,322 --> 00:47:45,824
这里真的超级好玩的
Whoo-hoo!

749
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:45,833
There's a lot of me up here!

750
00:47:51,246 --> 00:47:53,207
我喜欢泡网咖
<i>I love pivonka!</i>

751
00:47:52,974 --> 00:47:55,375
<i>? Uptown funk you up Uptown funk you up ?</i>

752
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:59,880
再来，一个下马
And big dismount!

753
00:47:59,914 --> 00:48:01,381
Whoo-hoo!

754
00:48:01,515 --> 00:48:02,717
Yeah!

755
00:48:06,762 --> 00:48:07,930
我收下
I'll take that.

756
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:14,428
Whoo-hoo! We did it!

757
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,686
我们成功了
That was amazing! Way to go, Tails.

758
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:17,940
刚才超赞的，做得很棒哦，塔尔斯

759
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:31,245
只有音速小子索尼克 能够尬舞尬得这么厉害
Wow.

760
00:48:27,775 --> 00:48:31,079
Only Sonic the Hedgehog could win a dance battle that epic.

761
00:48:31,328 --> 00:48:32,746
伙伴，好好跟着
Well, stick with me, pal.

762
00:48:32,829 --> 00:48:36,834
虽然地球非常危险 但我对淡蓝色小圆点的一切都熟到爆
Earth can be a scary place,

763
00:48:34,314 --> 00:48:36,751
but I know everything about this old pale blue dot.

764
00:48:36,917 --> 00:48:38,627
你刚刚是说真的吗？
Do you really mean that?

765
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:42,297
其实也不算全部 不过我看过很多探索频道的影片
I mean, not everything. But I watch a lot of Discovery Channel and...

766
00:48:42,381 --> 00:48:45,259
我意思是…我算你的伙伴？
I meant about me being your pal.

767
00:48:46,885 --> 00:48:48,303
当然，兄弟
Of course, buddy.

768
00:48:51,598 --> 00:48:52,891
这么直接
Comin' in hot.

769
00:48:53,475 --> 00:48:56,186
其实我一直都没交过朋友
Growing up, I didn't have any friends.

770
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:59,189
村子里的大家都觉得 有两条尾巴很奇怪
Everyone in my village thought my two tails were weird.

771
00:48:59,273 --> 00:49:01,024
嘿，我懂这种感受
Hey, I know that feeling.

772
00:49:01,108 --> 00:49:05,153
可是我看到了你 你是银河系最迅速的生物
But then I saw you, the fastest creature in the galaxy.

773
00:49:05,237 --> 00:49:09,116
你也一样很奇怪，但你是一个传奇
You were weird too. But you were a legend.

774
00:49:09,616 --> 00:49:12,911
你让我觉得奇怪好像也没什么不好
That made me think, maybe being weird isn't so bad.

775
00:49:13,495 --> 00:49:16,415
你启发了我，我离开我的村庄来找你
You inspired me to leave my village,

776
00:49:16,498 --> 00:49:19,459
帮助你完成任务
to find you and help you in your mission.

777
00:49:20,043 --> 00:49:21,837
很高兴你过来，塔尔斯
I'm really glad you're here, Tails.

778
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,922
我也是一样，索尼克
I'm glad I'm here too, Sonic.

779
00:49:29,803 --> 00:49:32,723
现在就先睡个觉
Well, might as well get some sleep.

780
00:49:32,806 --> 00:49:35,267
这里感觉是个过夜的好地方
This feels like a good place to spend the night.

781
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:37,102
等暴风停了之后 就能从道具读到精确的数据
You'll be able to get clear readings on your gizmo thing

782
00:49:37,186 --> 00:49:39,688
所以…
once the storm is over, so I...

783
00:49:51,491 --> 00:49:52,784
晚安，塔尔斯
Night, Tails.

784
00:50:06,757 --> 00:50:09,843
塔尔斯、塔尔斯，这里有点状况
Tails. Tails. We have a situation.

785
00:50:15,083 --> 00:50:16,383
Hoo-hoo!

786
00:50:16,683 --> 00:50:19,520
看样子今天的天气状况是一片晴空万里
Today's forecast calls for clear, sunny skies

787
00:50:19,603 --> 00:50:22,523
然后再加上百分之百的冒险机率
and a 100% chance of adventure.

788
00:50:22,606 --> 00:50:25,567
我找到坐标的位置了，就在那山顶上
I pinpointed the coordinates. It's right up ahead.

789
00:50:28,096 --> 00:50:29,496
Wow.

790
00:50:39,706 --> 00:50:40,999
塔尔斯，等等
Hey, Tails. Wait up.

791
00:50:42,676 --> 00:50:43,945
Whoa.

792
00:50:46,672 --> 00:50:50,801
好的，找到一扇有猫头鹰的大门 应该错不了
Okay, we got a giant owl door. Seems encouraging.

793
00:51:01,361 --> 00:51:02,662
Whoa.

794
00:51:04,106 --> 00:51:05,232
你看看这个
Check this out.

795
00:51:05,315 --> 00:51:08,026
-你可以翻译这些字吗？ -可以
Can you translate that?

796
00:51:06,701 --> 00:51:08,035
Uh, yeah.

797
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:12,614
很久以前，有一群英勇战士
<i>Ages ago, a fearsome group of warriors,</i>

798
00:51:12,698 --> 00:51:14,324
被称为针鼹一族
<i>known as the Echidnas,</i>

799
00:51:14,408 --> 00:51:16,702
他们把七个混沌翡翠
<i>forged the Seven Chaos Emeralds</i>

800
00:51:16,785 --> 00:51:20,539
镶嵌在有史以来最无敌的武器上面
<i>into the most unstoppable weapon ever created.</i>

801
00:51:23,458 --> 00:51:25,460
就是王者翡翠
The Master Emerald.

802
00:51:25,544 --> 00:51:27,921
有了它，就算单枪匹马
<i>With it, a single warrior</i>

803
00:51:28,005 --> 00:51:30,507
也能轻易地横扫千军
<i>could defeat entire armies.</i>

804
00:51:33,051 --> 00:51:35,429
一派英雄藏起了翡翠
<i>Believing no one should have such power,</i>

805
00:51:36,096 --> 00:51:39,057
深信这股力量不该属于谁
<i>an order of heroes recovered the Emerald</i>

806
00:51:39,141 --> 00:51:41,894
发誓不让翡翠落入恶徒手中
<i>and swore to protect it from evil.</i>

807
00:51:42,936 --> 00:51:44,771
看样子针鼹一族跟猫头鹰一族
Sounds like the Owls and the Echidnas

808
00:51:44,855 --> 00:51:47,316
互相争斗了好几个世纪
have been fighting each other for centuries.

809
00:51:47,399 --> 00:51:49,401
就像冯迪索跟巨石强森
Like Vin Diesel and The Rock.

810
00:51:51,195 --> 00:51:52,196
等我一下
Whoa! Wait for me.

811
00:51:58,702 --> 00:52:02,956
好的，猫头鹰大门的后面 有大猫头鹰，很有道理
Okay, giant owl door, giant owl. Makes sense.

812
00:52:03,724 --> 00:52:05,525
Whoa.

813
00:52:14,551 --> 00:52:17,262
先等一下，我以前看过这些符号
Wait a second. I've seen these symbols before.

814
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:22,643
试试看吧
Here we go.

815
00:52:31,276 --> 00:52:32,778
确实起了作用
Well, that did something.

816
00:52:50,462 --> 00:52:53,340
-是罗盘 -它能带我们去找翡翠
Whoa! The compass!

817
00:52:51,438 --> 00:52:53,506
This will lead us to the Emerald!

818
00:52:59,137 --> 00:53:01,682
你的脸上有一个小…
Hey, you got a little something on your...

819
00:53:01,765 --> 00:53:04,393
噢不，塔尔斯退后
Oh, no. Tails, get back.

820
00:53:09,064 --> 00:53:10,065
跑
Run!

821
00:53:17,155 --> 00:53:18,282
又是那家伙
That guy again?

822
00:53:18,365 --> 00:53:22,160
注意啦，我的小石笋 谁叫了ｕｂｅｒ呀
Heads up, my little stalagmites.

823
00:53:20,467 --> 00:53:21,869
Someone call an Uber?

824
00:53:22,244 --> 00:53:25,622
感谢你们完成困难的部分
Hey, thanks for doing all the hard stuff.

825
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:31,086
现在由我们接手
But we'll take it from here.

826
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:33,672
好吧，我们真的要好好谈谈你的新造型
Okay, we really gotta talk about your new look.

827
00:53:33,755 --> 00:53:36,508
你那根本是X教授尬上地产大亨
It's like Professor X meets the Monopoly man.

828
00:53:36,592 --> 00:53:40,012
而且有哪种天才会开着敞篷车 到很冷的西伯利亚？
And what kind of genius shows up to Siberia in a convertible?

829
00:53:40,095 --> 00:53:43,098
只要按下开关，就能炒热气氛
The kind of genius that can turn up the heat...

830
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,768
就是我这样的天才
with a flick of a switch.

831
00:53:54,534 --> 00:53:57,371
Oh! Whoo!

832
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:00,991
不错嘛，那些雕像应该不重要
Good one! I'm sure that wasn't important.

833
00:54:03,452 --> 00:54:05,662
塔尔斯，出口在那里，快点
Tails, that's our exit. Come on.

834
00:54:19,593 --> 00:54:20,761
我们分头
Uh-huh. Let's split up.

835
00:54:20,844 --> 00:54:23,347
-你走上面，我走下面 -好的
You go high, I go low.

836
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:25,891
快速伸展一下…要冲
Right.

837
00:54:23,596 --> 00:54:25,967
Quick little stretch and here we go.

838
00:54:37,736 --> 00:54:38,946
你想玩是吗？
Oh, so you want to play?

839
00:54:44,034 --> 00:54:45,410
新的武器？
That's new.

840
00:54:45,685 --> 00:54:47,922
Whoa.

841
00:54:56,922 --> 00:54:57,923
索尼克
Sonic!

842
00:55:09,726 --> 00:55:10,769
（发现威胁）

843
00:55:11,353 --> 00:55:12,813
雪球大战
Snowball fight!

844
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:22,030
太简单了，拜托，增加一点难度
It's too easy. Come on, challenge me!

845
00:55:31,165 --> 00:55:35,936
<i>? There's a summer place ?</i>

846
00:55:36,295 --> 00:55:39,256
这就叫做花式躲子弹
We are talking style and pizzazz.

847
00:55:39,106 --> 00:55:41,876
<i>? Where it may rain or storm ?</i>

848
00:55:42,009 --> 00:55:43,878
Pew-pew-pew! Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

849
00:55:44,011 --> 00:55:45,746
<i>? Yet I'm safe and warm ?</i>

850
00:55:46,638 --> 00:55:49,224
我表现得真帅
Yeah! I make this look good.

851
00:55:51,685 --> 00:55:53,854
太好了，他是酷寒战士
Oh, great. The Winter Soldier.

852
00:56:00,819 --> 00:56:03,655
你的拳头那么大一个居然还打不到我
For a guy named Knuckles, you are really bad at punching.

853
00:56:04,239 --> 00:56:07,034
交出那个罗盘，你是敌不过我的
Surrender the compass! You are no match for me.

854
00:56:07,117 --> 00:56:09,620
我可是为了它，身经千锤百炼
I've been training for this my entire life.

855
00:56:09,703 --> 00:56:13,207
可是我练都没有练过 就已经在这里领先你一大步
And I had no training at all, yet here I am ahead of you.

856
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:15,375
听起来真的是尬到爆
That's gotta be embarrassing.

857
00:56:21,673 --> 00:56:22,758
我的金环
My rings!

858
00:56:26,094 --> 00:56:29,515
有没有谁跟你说过 你应该管管自己的脾气？
Has anyone ever told you you've got serious anger issues?

859
00:56:30,015 --> 00:56:32,142
继续用你的烂笑话嘲笑我吧
You mock me with your weak jokes,

860
00:56:32,226 --> 00:56:34,436
你根本不了解我，刺猬
but you know nothing about me, hedgehog.

861
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:38,524
你们这些针鼹 都有不请自来的坏习惯，会毁掉我的生活
Well, I know you Echidnas have a habit of showing up uninvited and ruining my life.

862
00:56:38,607 --> 00:56:42,027
毁掉你的生活？又是一个烂笑话
Ruining your life? Another bad joke.

863
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:44,947
我就是因为你失去了一切
I lost everything because of you.

864
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:48,325
我的部落原本能拿下最后的胜利
<i>My tribe was on the verge of its greatest victory.</i>

865
00:56:48,408 --> 00:56:51,286
在找到最后一名猫头鹰战士之后
<i>The last of the Owl warriors had been located.</i>

866
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:55,123
很快的，长爪关于翡翠的秘密就能被掌握
<i>Soon Longclaw's Emerald secrets would be ours.</i>

867
00:56:55,207 --> 00:56:58,418
但是我父亲阻止我加入那场战斗
<i>But my father stopped me from joining the fight.</i>

868
00:56:58,502 --> 00:57:02,047
他说我荣耀部落的时刻会来临
<i>He said my moment to honor our tribe would come,</i>

869
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:04,258
但现在还不是时候
<i>but it was not this moment.</i>

870
00:57:04,341 --> 00:57:06,969
这就是他告诉我的最后一句话
<i>Those were the last words he spoke to me.</i>

871
00:57:07,052 --> 00:57:09,388
我再也没见到他
I never saw him again.

872
00:57:10,973 --> 00:57:13,475
我们都在那天失去了一切…
We both lost everything that day.

873
00:57:15,894 --> 00:57:17,437
再见，索尼克
Goodbye, Sonic. No!

874
00:57:17,521 --> 00:57:19,398
不要，长爪
<i>Longclaw!</i>

875
00:57:23,694 --> 00:57:25,571
索尼克，你还好吗？
Sonic! Are you okay?

876
00:57:25,654 --> 00:57:26,822
卑鄙小人
Deceiver!

877
00:57:27,447 --> 00:57:29,533
不不不，我没有耍你
No, it wasn't a trick.

878
00:57:30,117 --> 00:57:32,911
塔尔斯，接住罗盘，然后离开这里
Tails, take the compass and get out of here!

879
00:57:36,157 --> 00:57:37,191
Yeah!

880
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,419
先撤退，讨厌鬼
Later, haters!

881
00:57:43,755 --> 00:57:44,882
塔尔斯
Tails!

882
00:57:52,055 --> 00:57:53,640
塔尔斯，快点醒醒
Tails, come on. Wake up.

883
00:57:53,724 --> 00:57:56,393
他选择帮忙狐狸而不是拿回罗盘
He chose helping the fox over pursuing the compass.

884
00:57:56,476 --> 00:58:00,647
他当然会帮忙 新朋友还是让他一样的可悲
Of course he did.

885
00:57:57,912 --> 00:58:00,514
New friend, same pathetic weakness.

886
00:58:00,648 --> 00:58:03,050
Hmm.

887
00:58:10,949 --> 00:58:13,619
糟糕，完蛋了，好，我们现在麻烦大了
Oh, no. No, no, no. We're in real trouble here.

888
00:58:13,702 --> 00:58:16,705
快点，我需要你带我们飞走，快醒过来
Come on, Tails. I need you to fly us out of here. Time to wake up.

889
00:58:24,379 --> 00:58:27,508
掰啦，小子们，祝你们滑得愉快
See ya, kids. Enjoy the fresh powder.

890
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:48,362
（瑞秋与兰斗，天长地久）

891
00:58:53,033 --> 00:58:54,117
是你？
Did you...

892
00:58:59,623 --> 00:59:02,543
这对戒指象征着…
These rings signify the...

893
00:59:08,131 --> 00:59:09,258
很抱歉
Sorry.

894
00:59:09,883 --> 00:59:11,426
原本是静音的
Thought it was on silent.

895
00:59:18,016 --> 00:59:19,268
这对戒指…
These rings...

896
00:59:21,436 --> 00:59:22,729
帮个忙，托马斯
So help me, Thomas!

897
00:59:26,275 --> 00:59:27,484
（紧急！尽速回电！）
Okay, sorry. Sorry.

898
00:59:27,568 --> 00:59:29,027
好的，抱歉、抱歉
Excuse me, this is an emergency.

899
00:59:29,111 --> 00:59:30,654
不好意思，这是紧急状况

900
00:59:32,406 --> 00:59:33,949
抱歉
Sorry.

901
00:59:38,871 --> 00:59:41,206
怎样？最好是要紧的事，我…
What? This better be important. I just...

902
00:59:42,082 --> 00:59:43,083
你在滑雪？
<i>Are you skiing?</i>

903
00:59:43,166 --> 00:59:45,419
应该叫冲雪才对，我现在需要你的帮助
<i>Snowboarding, actually. But I need your help now.</i>

904
00:59:45,502 --> 00:59:47,838
目前状况可以用生死关头来形容
Life or death situation this very second.

905
00:59:47,921 --> 00:59:50,841
我需要你用之前给你的金环救我 拜托快点
I need you to use the ring I gave you to save me. Like right now.

906
00:59:50,924 --> 00:59:53,177
慢一点，好啦，冷静点 我不知道你在哪里
<i>Okay, slow down. I don't even know where you are.</i>

907
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:55,470
想着要去的地方，金环就会带你去
You just gotta picture where you want the ring to go.

908
00:59:55,554 --> 00:59:56,680
想象在这里
So picture this.

909
00:59:59,474 --> 01:00:02,019
天啊，好啦…等等
Oh, my God. Okay, okay. Hang on.

910
01:00:10,485 --> 01:00:11,486
什么？
What?

911
01:00:13,155 --> 01:00:14,281
丢出去了吗？
<i>Did you throw it?</i>

912
01:00:15,324 --> 01:00:17,743
-天啊 -什么？为什么你要说“天啊”？
<i>Oh, God. What? Tell me what "Oh, God."</i>

913
01:00:17,826 --> 01:00:19,369
我逗乔乔的时候，好像弄混了戒指跟金环
I mixed up the rings when I was teasing Jojo.

914
01:00:19,453 --> 01:00:20,871
什么？金环在哪？在哪？
<i>What? Where is it then?</i>

915
01:00:25,375 --> 01:00:26,460
你不会想知道
You don't want to know.

916
01:00:26,543 --> 01:00:27,878
我想知道，汤姆
<i>But I do, Tom.</i>

917
01:00:27,961 --> 01:00:29,296
我真的很想在变成刺猬雪花冰之前
<i>I very much want to know,</i>

918
01:00:29,379 --> 01:00:31,840
知道金环在哪里
before I become a hedgehog-flavored snow cone.

919
01:00:31,924 --> 01:00:34,009
你再撑一下，我可以的
Hang tight, buddy. I got this.

920
01:00:34,092 --> 01:00:35,886
藉由这枚戒指，瑞秋，我将会…
With this ring, Rachel...

921
01:00:36,512 --> 01:00:37,721
嗨
Hey! Hi.

922
01:00:38,805 --> 01:00:40,599
你还好吗，老弟？
Uh... Everything okay, bud?

923
01:00:40,682 --> 01:00:42,226
-汤姆，你在做什么？ -不太好，我知道听起来很怪
Not really. What are you doing?

924
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:45,812
但那个戒指拜托借我看一下，一下就好
This is gonna sound crazy, but I need to see that ring

925
01:00:43,977 --> 01:00:46,180
for just one second. Have you lost your mind?

926
01:00:45,896 --> 01:00:48,315
-你哪里有毛病？ -我马上还给你，我保证
I'm gonna give it right back, I promise.

927
01:00:48,398 --> 01:00:51,151
-兰斗，这真的很重要，我能… -不，老弟，请坐好
Please, Randall, it's really important. No, bro. Go sit down.

928
01:00:51,235 --> 01:00:54,196
-兰斗，把戒指给我，拜托，只要一下… -好，兰斗，别看他，看着我
Give me the ring, please? Randall, don't look at him, look at me.

929
01:00:54,279 --> 01:00:55,864
-兰斗 一下就好 -把戒指套上去
One second. Put the ring on my finger.

930
01:00:55,948 --> 01:00:59,284
-不，兰斗，听我说，我要… -兰斗，看着我，把戒指套上去
No, Randall, listen to me.

931
01:00:57,358 --> 01:00:59,059
Randall! Look at me. Ring on my finger.

932
01:00:59,368 --> 01:01:01,828
-兰斗，拜托 戒指给我一下… -快点套上去
Give me the ring! Just one second. Put a ring on it!

933
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:03,956
亲爱的，拜托
Please, love? Okay?

934
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:05,040
-藉由这枚戒指… -很好，宝贝
With this ring... Yes, baby.

935
01:01:05,123 --> 01:01:06,583
抱歉，我必须这么做
I'm so sorry about this.

936
01:01:17,052 --> 01:01:19,179
-雪崩，天啊 -糟了
Snow, my God. Oh, boy.

937
01:01:19,972 --> 01:01:22,474
我来
Incoming!

938
01:01:25,854 --> 01:01:27,421
Oh.

939
01:01:32,943 --> 01:01:34,361
有人受伤吗？
Anybody hurt?

940
01:01:34,444 --> 01:01:36,488
-索尼克 -夏威夷
Sonic! Hawaii.

941
01:01:36,572 --> 01:01:37,823
你还好吗？
Are you okay?

942
01:01:37,906 --> 01:01:39,783
发生什么事？受伤了吗？
What's happening? Are you hurt?

943
01:01:39,867 --> 01:01:41,827
-没有，我没事 -太好了
No, no, I'm fine. Okay, good.

944
01:01:41,910 --> 01:01:45,455
-因为你这下子麻烦大了 -好了，你先冷静
Because you're in so much trouble!

945
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:45,406
Okay, you calm down.

946
01:01:45,539 --> 01:01:46,874
你，解释
You talk.

947
01:01:46,957 --> 01:01:48,375
好的，简单来说
Okay, quick version.

948
01:01:48,458 --> 01:01:51,253
蛋头博士回到地球，而且在寻找魔法翡翠
Robotnik is back on Earth and he's after a magic emerald.

949
01:01:52,796 --> 01:01:55,340
必须拿回翡翠，不然世界会毁灭
We need to get it back or the world is doomed.

950
01:01:56,049 --> 01:01:57,176
塔尔斯
Tails!

951
01:01:57,259 --> 01:02:00,721
-等一下，这都是在昨天发生的？ -等一下，谁是塔尔斯？
Wait! All this happened since yesterday?

952
01:02:00,804 --> 01:02:02,055
塔尔斯，听得见吗？
Wait. Who's Tails?

953
01:02:02,139 --> 01:02:04,099
天哪，现在有两只了
Tails, can you hear me?

954
01:02:02,022 --> 01:02:03,924
Oh, Lord, there are two of them now.

955
01:02:04,183 --> 01:02:06,351
好吧…我想想…塔尔斯，快醒醒
Okay, let me think. Tails, come on, buddy.

956
01:02:11,106 --> 01:02:12,482
什么？
Hey!

957
01:02:12,566 --> 01:02:14,735
兰斗，为什么你朋友都拿着武器？
Randall, why do all of your friends have weapons?

958
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:20,073
你们早该接受我提供的餐券的 华卓斯基夫妇
You really should have taken me up on that brunch, Mr. and Mrs. Wachowski.

959
01:02:20,866 --> 01:02:21,909
那个橄榄园男？
Olive Garden guy?

960
01:02:21,992 --> 01:02:24,536
大家冷静别惊慌，我们是联邦探员
It's okay, everyone. We're federal agents.

961
01:02:25,913 --> 01:02:27,789
你也是，探员，进行任务
You, too, Agent. Go ahead.

962
01:02:34,296 --> 01:02:38,383
你是打算告诉我 整场婚礼只是计划的一部分？
You mean to tell me

963
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:38,927
that this entire wedding was a setup? Rachel, wait a minute.

964
01:02:38,467 --> 01:02:40,177
-瑞秋，先等一下 -什么？
What?

965
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:41,345
说得对，女士
That's correct, ma'am.

966
01:02:41,428 --> 01:02:44,806
我们网链行动的每个层面 都是彻头彻尾虚构出来的
Every single aspect of Operation Catfish

967
01:02:43,163 --> 01:02:44,998
was a complete fabrication.

968
01:02:45,974 --> 01:02:47,392
这个叫网链行动？
Operation Catfish?

969
01:02:48,185 --> 01:02:49,770
这里的每个人都是探员？
So is everyone here an agent?

970
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:52,397
你也是探员吗？
Are you an agent?

971
01:02:53,232 --> 01:02:54,441
你这个混…
Son of a...

972
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:58,237
卖花的也是探员吗？ 那我们的摄影师呢？
Was the florist an agent? How about the photographer?

973
01:02:58,862 --> 01:03:00,364
那个在SPA帮我除…
The woman who waxed my...

974
01:03:01,365 --> 01:03:02,449
的女人也是？
at the spa?

975
01:03:04,451 --> 01:03:06,453
-乔乔也是探员吗？ -瑞秋
Is Jojo an agent?

976
01:03:05,085 --> 01:03:06,420
Rachel.

977
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:09,122
-什么？ -瑞秋，先听我说
What?

978
01:03:09,206 --> 01:03:12,292
我不想再听了，我不想再听了
Rachel, listen to me.

979
01:03:09,089 --> 01:03:10,224
I'm done listening!

980
01:03:10,357 --> 01:03:12,459
I am done listening!

981
01:03:12,835 --> 01:03:15,838
我真的很对不起，真的很对不起
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

982
01:03:15,921 --> 01:03:17,506
我真的觉得很抱歉
I really am. I am so sorry.

983
01:03:19,466 --> 01:03:21,134
不行，住手
No. Hey, no!

984
01:03:22,511 --> 01:03:24,680
放开他
Let him go! Hey!

985
01:03:27,641 --> 01:03:28,809
索尼克，撑住
Sonic, hang on.

986
01:03:29,852 --> 01:03:31,979
-冷静…冷静点，这不值得 -汤姆
Take it easy. It's not worth it.

987
01:03:31,011 --> 01:03:32,513
Tom! Ah-ah-ah.

988
01:03:32,896 --> 01:03:35,482
索尼克不是威胁，他站在我们这边
Sonic is not a threat. He's on our side.

989
01:03:35,566 --> 01:03:37,484
他是个不受控制的外星人
He's an uncontrolled extraterrestrial.

990
01:03:37,568 --> 01:03:39,653
你们帮助跟教唆他的日子结束了
And your days of aiding and abetting him are over.

991
01:03:40,404 --> 01:03:42,447
在直升机抵达前，把他们关在饭店里
Secure them in the hotel until the chopper arrives.

992
01:03:43,198 --> 01:03:44,449
你犯了个大错
You're making a mistake.

993
01:03:44,533 --> 01:03:46,076
等等，可恶的少校
Hold on, Major A-hole!

994
01:03:46,743 --> 01:03:48,328
今天还是我的日子
This is still my day,

995
01:03:48,412 --> 01:03:52,124
一定有人要解释 现在是什么莫名其妙的状况
and someone is gonna explain to me what the hell is going on here!

996
01:03:52,207 --> 01:03:55,544
那次旧金山事件之后 我们成立了一个全球特遣队
After the events in San Francisco,

997
01:03:53,534 --> 01:03:55,302
a global task force was created,

998
01:03:55,627 --> 01:03:58,839
致力于保护地球不受到外星威胁
devoted to protecting our planet from alien threats.

999
01:03:58,922 --> 01:04:01,592
那一天，国家防卫部队ＧＵＮ诞生了
That day, Guardian Units of Nations was born.

1000
01:04:01,675 --> 01:04:04,261
-ＧＵＮ，枪的英文？ -ＧＵＮ，对啊
G-U-N. Seriously? GUN, yeah.

1001
01:04:04,344 --> 01:04:06,930
那组织会保护地球免于蛋头的威胁吗？
Look, what about protecting our planet from Dr. Robotnik?

1002
01:04:08,265 --> 01:04:09,641
蛋头已经死了
Robotnik is dead.

1003
01:04:09,725 --> 01:04:11,810
你错了，他回来了
You're wrong. He's back.

1004
01:04:11,894 --> 01:04:14,313
唯一能阻止他的人刚才被你拖走
And you just hauled away the only ones who could stop him.

1005
01:04:17,357 --> 01:04:19,067
蛋头听说好像东山再起了
Sounds like Robotnik might be back in play.

1006
01:04:19,151 --> 01:04:21,653
如果是真的，我要他立刻被找到
If he is, I want him found immediately.

1007
01:04:22,988 --> 01:04:25,157
帮我取消五点钟在橄榄园的预约
And cancel my five o'clock at the Olive Garden.

1008
01:04:25,657 --> 01:04:27,284
-麦蒂阿姨 -怎么了？
Aunt Maddie? Yeah.

1009
01:04:27,367 --> 01:04:29,036
索尼克和他朋友掉的
Sonic and his friend dropped this.

1010
01:04:35,876 --> 01:04:37,294
我有一个点子
I have an idea.

1011
01:04:37,377 --> 01:04:39,546
我有句话要跟我未婚夫说
And I want to have a word with my fiancé.

1012
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:41,256
这句话就是他完了
And that word is "murder."

1013
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,764
拜托，你们不能就这样离开
Hey, come on. You can't just leave us in here.

1014
01:04:48,847 --> 01:04:51,975
我朋友受伤了 他需要医生，或是兽医之类的
My friend is hurt! He needs a doctor, a vet, anyone!

1015
01:04:53,393 --> 01:04:56,188
塔尔斯，你快点醒醒，拜托，赶快起来
Tails, you got to wake up, buddy.

1016
01:04:54,829 --> 01:04:56,463
Please wake up.

1017
01:05:04,530 --> 01:05:05,656
第二小队准备就位
All clear.

1018
01:05:09,284 --> 01:05:10,869
好的，策略如下
All right. Game plan.

1019
01:05:10,953 --> 01:05:13,914
-我进饭店里找汤姆跟索尼克被藏在哪里 -好的
I get inside the hotel and find where they're hiding Tom and Sonic.

1020
01:05:13,997 --> 01:05:15,624
我这边去找兰斗
Okay. Then I find Randall, right?

1021
01:05:15,707 --> 01:05:17,125
我会把他的氧气，从他胡说八道
And then I squeeze the breath

1022
01:05:17,209 --> 01:05:21,296
爱说谎…除完毛的身体挤出来
from his lying, deceitful, perfectly manscaped body!

1023
01:05:23,674 --> 01:05:25,384
我现在心情一团乱
I'm going through a lot right now.

1024
01:05:25,467 --> 01:05:28,554
-让我用我的方式发泄一下，好吗？ -好
So let me process this my own way, okay?

1025
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:28,428
Sure, sure.

1026
01:05:29,221 --> 01:05:30,848
-好，很OK的 -好想写日记
No judgment. Should've brought a journal.

1027
01:05:30,931 --> 01:05:32,307
好吧，拿好
Okay...

1028
01:05:32,391 --> 01:05:35,936
-这也是武器吗？感觉好可爱 -对啊
Okay. Is this meant to be a weapon? This is adorable.

1029
01:05:37,104 --> 01:05:38,146
接招，兰斗
Pew, pew! Take that, Randall!

1030
01:05:39,064 --> 01:05:40,274
跑啊，兰斗
Run, Randall!

1031
01:05:40,357 --> 01:05:41,775
好了啦
All right.

1032
01:05:41,859 --> 01:05:43,777
-之后就知道了 -好啊
We're about to find out. All right!

1033
01:05:43,861 --> 01:05:45,654
去ＢＡＮＧ掉一些人
Let's go kick some Booty.

1034
01:05:48,181 --> 01:05:49,851
Shh! Shh!

1035
01:05:59,168 --> 01:06:00,627
瑞秋，不要喝
Rachel! No. Rachel!

1036
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,005
一下下
In a minute.

1037
01:06:04,065 --> 01:06:05,632
Mm-mmm! Mm.

1038
01:06:08,719 --> 01:06:09,678
站住不准动
Stop right there!

1039
01:06:10,387 --> 01:06:11,597
快拿包包 快点、快点
Get the bag.

1040
01:06:19,813 --> 01:06:21,356
他有办法下来，对吧？
He's gonna come back down, right?

1041
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:22,941
我不知道
I don't know.

1042
01:06:22,983 --> 01:06:23,984
加油
Good luck!

1043
01:06:26,153 --> 01:06:28,488
你看，汤姆跟索尼克一定在里面
Look. Tom and Sonic have to be inside.

1044
01:06:29,198 --> 01:06:30,991
很好，我有个未婚夫要蒸发
I got a fiancé to vaporize. Uh-huh.

1045
01:06:31,074 --> 01:06:32,576
-千万要小心，好吗 -好的
Watch your back, sis. Okay.

1046
01:06:35,454 --> 01:06:36,455
兰斗
Randall!

1047
01:06:44,087 --> 01:06:46,131
看到她了，行动
We got her.

1048
01:06:44,706 --> 01:06:46,306
Move in.

1049
01:06:50,552 --> 01:06:51,595
好吧
Okay.

1050
01:07:07,236 --> 01:07:09,154
我原本不是要这么做的
I did not mean to do that!

1051
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:13,300
Whoo!

1052
01:07:21,917 --> 01:07:23,877
觉得困扰吗，探员？
Something bothering you, Agent?

1053
01:07:23,961 --> 01:07:26,630
对瑞秋做了这些，我很愧疚，长官
I just feel a little guilty about what I did to Rachel, sir.

1054
01:07:27,756 --> 01:07:30,008
你不用担心，我们会送餐券给她
Ah, don't worry about it. We'll send her a gift card.

1055
01:07:30,092 --> 01:07:32,219
现在，我们先来干一杯
Now, I propose a toast.

1056
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:38,225
庆祝这次行动都能够圆满执行
To a perfectly executed operation.

1057
01:07:42,896 --> 01:07:44,565
长官，我们遭受攻击
Sir, we're under attack.

1058
01:08:00,497 --> 01:08:01,832
（新婚燕尔）

1059
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:08,463
兰斗，老婆回来
Randall, wifey's home!

1060
01:08:13,135 --> 01:08:14,761
我的天哪，瑞秋
Oh, my God. Rachel.

1061
01:08:16,663 --> 01:08:19,000
<i>? You lying so low In the weeds ?</i>

1062
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:23,104
<i>? I bet you gonna ambush me ?</i>

1063
01:08:23,237 --> 01:08:28,810
<i>? You'd have me down, down Down, down on my knees ?</i>

1064
01:08:28,943 --> 01:08:31,611
<i>? Now wouldn't you, barracuda? ?</i>

1065
01:08:34,048 --> 01:08:35,883
<i>? Oh ?</i>

1066
01:08:39,453 --> 01:08:42,288
这个女人厉害
What a woman.

1067
01:08:44,457 --> 01:08:45,667
你这个恶劣又卑鄙…
You no-good,

1068
01:08:46,919 --> 01:08:49,921
肮脏、爱说谎…
lowdown, dirty, lying...

1069
01:08:50,005 --> 01:08:51,215
瑞秋，拜托听我解释
Rachel, just listen to me.

1070
01:08:51,298 --> 01:08:55,551
到底是哪门子的神经病 会骗人，骗到办一场假的婚礼？
What kind of twisted sicko

1071
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,368
tricks someone into a fake wedding?

1072
01:08:57,970 --> 01:09:00,182
派对结束了，哥吉娘，站在那别动
Party's over, Bridezilla. Stop right there.

1073
01:09:01,517 --> 01:09:03,644
你这个混…
You son of a...

1074
01:09:03,727 --> 01:09:05,270
-我会成全你 -不行
Have it your way. No!

1075
01:09:05,979 --> 01:09:07,606
不
No!

1076
01:09:10,184 --> 01:09:12,286
Oh. Ugh. Oh!

1077
01:09:12,528 --> 01:09:14,863
真是让人失望，韩斗探员
Very disappointing, Agent Handel.

1078
01:09:17,783 --> 01:09:21,203
-那种东西算是武器？ -我不知道，但是马上就会揭晓
Ha! Is that supposed to be a weapon?

1079
01:09:19,126 --> 01:09:20,895
I don't know, but we gonna find out.

1080
01:09:21,286 --> 01:09:23,705
你今天惹的麻烦还不算多吗？
Haven't you caused enough trouble for one day?

1081
01:09:23,788 --> 01:09:26,082
我根本还没开始惹麻烦呢
I haven't even begun causing trouble.

1082
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:29,877
地狱的烈火比不上来自新娘的怒火
Hell hath no fury like a bride scorned.

1083
01:09:36,718 --> 01:09:39,011
这真的是武器
Looks like it's real, huh?

1084
01:09:41,249 --> 01:09:43,084
Whoa! Uh! Ah! Huh?

1085
01:09:43,267 --> 01:09:44,600
休想，没错
No. Right.

1086
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:49,106
说实话，我伤势严重吗？
Be honest. How bad is it?

1087
01:09:49,689 --> 01:09:52,317
根本没那么糟，只是被电击，你没事
Not bad at all. You got Tased. You'll be fine.

1088
01:09:56,905 --> 01:10:00,325
-但我好冷 -因为你躺在我们的冰雕上
I'm so cold.

1089
01:09:57,497 --> 01:10:00,201
You landed on our ice sculpture.

1090
01:10:00,409 --> 01:10:01,493
起来
Get up.

1091
01:10:07,474 --> 01:10:08,843
Just...

1092
01:10:09,209 --> 01:10:12,087
告诉我实话，拜托，就这一次
Just tell me the truth, for once.

1093
01:10:13,255 --> 01:10:17,426
关于你或我们之间有什么是真的？
Is there anything about you or about us that was real?

1094
01:10:18,218 --> 01:10:21,555
瑞秋，看着我，在认识你之前
Rachel, look at me.

1095
01:10:22,890 --> 01:10:26,518
我不认为我有机会得到真正的幸福
Before I met you,

1096
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:26,660
I didn't think that I was even capable of real happiness.

1097
01:10:28,187 --> 01:10:30,439
遇见你之后一切都改变了
But that all changed when you walked into my life.

1098
01:10:31,565 --> 01:10:34,318
我还打破了卧底工作的第一条规则
And I ended up breaking the first rule of undercover work.

1099
01:10:35,027 --> 01:10:36,403
是什么？
Which is?

1100
01:10:37,154 --> 01:10:38,530
绝不坠入爱河
Never fall in love.

1101
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:54,379
-麦蒂 -快点，我们快离开这里
Maddie! Maddie!

1102
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:55,672
什么？你怎么通过守卫的？
We're busting out of here. How'd you get past the guards?

1103
01:10:55,756 --> 01:10:57,591
多亏我们有小狐狸的疯狂道具
Because that little fox is into some crazy stuff.

1104
01:10:57,674 --> 01:10:58,717
快点
Come on.

1105
01:11:00,302 --> 01:11:01,970
-我们走 -你太神了
Let's go. You're amazing.

1106
01:11:12,648 --> 01:11:15,317
愚蠢的猫头鹰还以为能藏住这个
The Owls were fools to think they could hide this.

1107
01:11:23,516 --> 01:11:25,086
Ah.

1108
01:11:53,772 --> 01:11:54,940
发生什么事？
What's happening?

1109
01:11:56,567 --> 01:11:58,235
等着瞧
Wait for it.

1110
01:12:09,788 --> 01:12:12,040
尤里卡
Yes. Eureka!

1111
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:14,960
我找到了
I've found it!

1112
01:12:34,438 --> 01:12:35,564
索尼克
Sonic.

1113
01:12:37,524 --> 01:12:39,276
-那是什么？ -一个大麻烦
What is that? A big problem.

1114
01:12:40,319 --> 01:12:42,237
蛋头带着罗盘去找翡翠了
The compass led Robotnik to the Emerald.

1115
01:12:42,321 --> 01:12:44,323
那肯定是在几千英里外的地方
That's got to be hundreds of miles away.

1116
01:12:45,782 --> 01:12:49,203
好吧，靠过来，想一想计划
All right.

1117
01:12:47,101 --> 01:12:49,136
Huddle up. Let's figure out a plan.

1118
01:12:49,286 --> 01:12:51,330
-一起想 -已经没时间想了
Together.

1119
01:12:51,413 --> 01:12:53,373
我是唯一够快抵达那里的人
There's no time for that.

1120
01:12:51,839 --> 01:12:53,483
I'm the only one that can get there fast enough.

1121
01:12:53,457 --> 01:12:56,335
索尼克，这件事太重大了 你没办法独自承担
Sonic, this is way too big for you to do by yourself.

1122
01:12:56,919 --> 01:12:58,420
你们看到那边的小狐狸了吗？
You see that little fox over there?

1123
01:12:59,004 --> 01:13:02,007
他穿越了大半个宇宙来地球见他的英雄
He came all the way across the universe to meet his hero.

1124
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:05,010
但是英雄做了什么？几乎害他失去了小命
And what did his hero do? I practically got him killed.

1125
01:13:05,886 --> 01:13:07,846
说真的，你是对的
You know what? You were right.

1126
01:13:08,388 --> 01:13:11,975
我的时刻到了，但没有把握住 我不是英雄
My moment came and I blew it.

1127
01:13:12,059 --> 01:13:13,227
-先等… -不
I'm no hero.

1128
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:15,646
我不能再让别人因为我而受伤了
Wait. No.

1129
01:13:13,194 --> 01:13:14,594
I'm not letting anyone else get hurt

1130
01:13:15,729 --> 01:13:17,606
要趁来得及之前解决问题
because of me.

1131
01:13:15,963 --> 01:13:17,765
I'm gonna fix this while I still can.

1132
01:13:19,107 --> 01:13:20,734
索尼克
Sonic!

1133
01:13:20,817 --> 01:13:22,236
索尼克，等等
Sonic, wait!

1134
01:13:25,072 --> 01:13:26,949
不不…不可以，别乱动 别乱动，别乱动
Hold on. Wait. Don't move.

1135
01:13:27,032 --> 01:13:29,535
小家伙冷静点，你受伤了
Take it easy, little guy. You're hurt.

1136
01:13:29,618 --> 01:13:33,288
可是我们要帮他 你们不知道他要面对什么
But we have to help him. You don't know what he's up against.

1137
01:13:40,504 --> 01:13:41,880
现在相信了吗？
You believe us now?

1138
01:13:43,757 --> 01:13:45,392
Mm-hmm.

1139
01:13:49,012 --> 01:13:50,097
嘿，巴布
Hey, Bob!

1140
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:51,932
嘿，玛丽亚你们好吗？
Hey, Maria, how you doing? Hey!

1141
01:13:52,066 --> 01:13:53,200
Ah.

1142
01:13:54,101 --> 01:13:55,394
（霸咖）
Working on my moves.

1143
01:13:55,477 --> 01:13:56,520
我只是练习一下
Just keepin' it green. No need to burn the fuel.

1144
01:13:56,603 --> 01:13:59,231
好的棒球经理不会在一开始就让球队

1145
01:13:59,314 --> 01:14:00,315
轻松出局，差不多…
Speaking of fuel...

1146
01:14:06,738 --> 01:14:08,115
休息中？
Closed?

1147
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:10,909
不太对劲
That doesn't seem right.

1148
01:14:18,834 --> 01:14:21,962
（蛋头精品穿搭）

1149
01:14:23,714 --> 01:14:24,756
接近了
Close.

1150
01:14:29,303 --> 01:14:30,596
很好
Yes.

1151
01:14:30,679 --> 01:14:33,223
大改造，大改造，看看你
Makeover, makeover. Look at you.

1152
01:14:33,307 --> 01:14:34,641
警察，不准动
Freeze! Police!

1153
01:14:36,018 --> 01:14:38,103
欧买尬，你有机械手
Oh, my God, you got robot hands.

1154
01:14:38,187 --> 01:14:41,565
-不，这是手套 -举起来，快张开你的手指
No, they're gloves.

1155
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,749
Get 'em up. Now spread your fingers!

1156
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:45,527
现在甩一甩，甩甩你的手指
Now wiggle 'em! Wiggle your digits!

1157
01:14:46,987 --> 01:14:49,656
对，就像是你刚弹完一长串的曲子
Yes! Like you just finished a big musical number.

1158
01:14:51,491 --> 01:14:53,035
很好
Good.

1159
01:14:53,118 --> 01:14:54,536
你头上为什么有灯？
Why is there a light on your head?

1160
01:14:58,457 --> 01:15:00,501
因为我是周末专属的警长
'Cause I'm the sheriff for the weekend, pal.

1161
01:15:09,635 --> 01:15:10,594
水
Ugh. Water.

1162
01:15:10,677 --> 01:15:12,554
为什么一定要有水
Why did it have to be water?

1163
01:15:15,974 --> 01:15:18,310
好的，我办得到
Okay, you can do this.

1164
01:15:21,939 --> 01:15:23,524
加快速度
Gotta go fast.

1165
01:16:53,314 --> 01:16:54,815
Oh!

1166
01:17:06,126 --> 01:17:09,463
我不想就这样挂掉，这样太老套了
I don't want to die like this! It's derivative!

1167
01:17:11,006 --> 01:17:12,674
帮本大爷开路
Make room for Daddy!

1168
01:17:20,641 --> 01:17:21,808
两只、两只
Two and two. Great!

1169
01:17:21,892 --> 01:17:25,145
很好，我们还是双足动物，差不多啦
We're still bipedals, more or less.

1170
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:29,983
要爆
Fire in the hole!

1171
01:17:32,194 --> 01:17:35,405
我算过，陷阱都是每七秒发生一…次
I've solved it. There is a booby trap every seven seco...

1172
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:43,455
那个提早来了
That was a little early. Mmm.

1173
01:17:44,957 --> 01:17:48,544
幸好它没有切到我的胡子
Oh! So glad it didn't cut off my mustache.

1174
01:17:48,627 --> 01:17:51,046
嘿，前面这位小红炮
Hey, Little Red Wrecking Ball.

1175
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:54,216
我知道你想快点得到翡翠
I know you're dying to get your Emerald on,

1176
01:17:54,299 --> 01:17:58,011
但是我们可能要多注意一下周遭的环境
but can we be a little bit more mindful of our surroundings?

1177
01:17:58,512 --> 01:17:59,555
借过
May I?

1178
01:18:06,186 --> 01:18:08,772
九公尺之后，左转
<i>In 30 feet, turn left.</i>

1179
01:18:08,856 --> 01:18:10,732
凡事都要事半功倍
Work smarter, not harder.

1180
01:18:32,171 --> 01:18:33,547
我要散了
My pelvis.

1181
01:18:37,926 --> 01:18:42,055
好的，秘密神殿，看你有多厉害
Okay, Secret Temple, let's see what you've got.

1182
01:18:48,362 --> 01:18:50,063
Whoa!

1183
01:18:50,197 --> 01:18:52,032
No, no, no! No!

1184
01:18:56,570 --> 01:18:57,571
不行
No.

1185
01:18:58,739 --> 01:18:59,740
好耶
Yes!

1186
01:19:05,704 --> 01:19:07,623
您已经抵达目的地
<i>You have arrived at your destination.</i>

1187
01:19:07,706 --> 01:19:10,709
这样让空间变宽敞
Wow. That really opened up the space.

1188
01:19:10,792 --> 01:19:13,754
我根本无法想象原本有墙的样子
I can't even picture it with an impenetrable wall now.

1189
01:19:13,837 --> 01:19:15,756
碎石一直都是很棒的装潢材质
And the rubble is always a nice touch.

1190
01:19:24,973 --> 01:19:28,685
终于见到了这个王者翡翠
At last. The Master Emerald.

1191
01:19:28,769 --> 01:19:30,020
终极的力量
Ultimate power.

1192
01:19:30,103 --> 01:19:32,940
很快就能够恢复秩序
Soon order will be restored.

1193
01:19:33,023 --> 01:19:36,360
全都多亏了你我之间的合作
All because of what we have done together.

1194
01:19:36,443 --> 01:19:38,737
多么动人的感言，纳克鲁斯
Such a lovely sentiment, Knuckles.

1195
01:19:39,238 --> 01:19:41,823
我感觉眼角好像泛泪了
I think I feel a single tear forming.

1196
01:19:44,785 --> 01:19:46,036
真可惜
Sadly...

1197
01:19:47,204 --> 01:19:51,750
你现在对我来说 只是一张过气乐团的演唱会通行证
You're as useful to me now

1198
01:19:48,388 --> 01:19:52,226
as a backstage pass to Limp Bizkit.

1199
01:19:52,359 --> 01:19:54,762
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1200
01:20:06,431 --> 01:20:07,599
搞定
Nailed it.

1201
01:20:08,684 --> 01:20:12,229
这个家伙每次都来破坏我的坏事
This guy is always trying to spoil a bad thing!

1202
01:20:13,564 --> 01:20:16,066
你们两个也在这里？你们走远路J
Ah! You guys are here, too?

1203
01:20:16,149 --> 01:20:18,318
对你一切都是游戏吗？
Took the long way, huh?

1204
01:20:16,049 --> 01:20:18,118
Is everything a joke to you?

1205
01:20:18,402 --> 01:20:21,363
为什么你要一直阻碍我完成我的使命？
Why must you constantly interfere with my destiny?

1206
01:20:21,446 --> 01:20:25,117
因为我的使命就是保护我的朋友跟家人
Because my destiny is to protect my friends and family.

1207
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,369
我刚才好像吐在我的嘴里了
I think I just threw up in my mouth.

1208
01:20:28,161 --> 01:20:33,375
如果你想得到翡翠，那就必须先打倒我
And if you want that emerald, you're gonna have to go through me.

1209
01:20:38,873 --> 01:20:40,340
Whoa!

1210
01:20:55,647 --> 01:20:58,692
无情的针鼹，今天一直往死里打
The Echidna's taking no prisoners today!

1211
01:20:58,817 --> 01:21:02,529
好心的索尼克这次难道会万刺俱灰吗？
Sonic has heart, but will he lose the quill to live?

1212
01:21:04,364 --> 01:21:08,035
我不想跟你战斗 可是你让我没有其他选择
I don't want to fight you, but you're not giving me much choice.

1213
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:17,503
太容易了，准备办正事
Too easy. Let's do this.

1214
01:21:23,051 --> 01:21:24,484
Huh?

1215
01:21:44,655 --> 01:21:49,076
为什么你不乖乖站好光荣战死？
Why don't you stand still and die with honor?

1216
01:21:49,159 --> 01:21:50,410
让我考虑一下
Let me think about it.

1217
01:21:50,494 --> 01:21:54,164
好吧，考虑过了，然后我不要
Okay, I thought about it and I pass.

1218
01:22:03,632 --> 01:22:05,092
你好啊，小美人
Hi there, beautiful.

1219
01:22:06,385 --> 01:22:08,387
你是真实的，对吧？
You're the real deal, aren't you?

1220
01:22:09,096 --> 01:22:12,516
你这段时间都在哪里？

1221
01:22:16,353 --> 01:22:18,772
永别了，刺猬
Say goodbye, hedgehog.

1222
01:22:22,317 --> 01:22:25,195
纳克鲁斯，住手，你看蛋头想偷走翡翠
Knuckles, stop. Robotnik's stealing the Emerald!

1223
01:22:25,279 --> 01:22:27,739
你把我当成什么样的傻瓜？
What kind of fool do you take me for?

1224
01:22:27,823 --> 01:22:29,074
你自己看
Just look.

1225
01:22:31,618 --> 01:22:32,953
我的
Mine.

1226
01:22:34,204 --> 01:22:36,915
等等，我们的协议不是这样
Wait! That wasn't the deal.

1227
01:22:40,377 --> 01:22:43,005
你这只天真的可怜虫
Oh, you poor, naive creature.

1228
01:22:43,088 --> 01:22:44,506
不是你的错
It's not your fault.

1229
01:22:44,590 --> 01:22:48,218
高智商的人在一英里以外就会预料到了
A more advanced intellect would have seen this move coming a mile away.

1230
01:22:48,302 --> 01:22:50,137
或者是你们说的１.６公里
Or 1.6 kilometers.

1231
01:22:50,637 --> 01:22:53,390
但是我相信你，你是我的朋友
But I trusted you! You were my friend!

1232
01:23:00,522 --> 01:23:02,941
真抱歉，戳到我的笑穴了
I'm sorry. That just hit me funny.

1233
01:23:03,859 --> 01:23:08,906
我来帮你上我们的最后一课 你这个来自天边的呆瓜息肉
Let this be my final lesson to you,

1234
01:23:06,319 --> 01:23:08,923
you dim-witted celestial skin tag.

1235
01:23:09,865 --> 01:23:11,241
朋友
Friends...

1236
01:23:11,325 --> 01:23:15,329
必须要敞开心扉、互相包容才算朋友
are open, honest and vulnerable with each other.

1237
01:23:15,412 --> 01:23:17,956
这就表示Ｘ平方要乘以Ｙ平方的斜边
Which means X squared times the hypotenuse of Y squared,

1238
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:20,876
然后再除以友情的绝对值，等于…
divided by the absolute value of friendship, equals...

1239
01:23:21,376 --> 01:23:22,419
渣渣
dookie!

1240
01:23:22,503 --> 01:23:23,754
糟了
Oh, no.

1241
01:23:31,887 --> 01:23:36,892
浑沌就是力量
Chaos is power!

1242
01:23:55,202 --> 01:23:56,954
我们快点逃出去
Let's get out of here!

1243
01:24:09,508 --> 01:24:10,676
纳克鲁斯
Knuckles!

1244
01:24:15,138 --> 01:24:18,016
怎么又是水，烦耶
Water again? Come on!

1245
01:24:37,812 --> 01:24:39,947
Mmm?

1246
01:24:40,081 --> 01:24:41,916
Mmm?

1247
01:24:42,049 --> 01:24:43,785
Mmm. Mmm.

1248
01:24:44,819 --> 01:24:45,987
Mmm?

1249
01:25:16,742 --> 01:25:20,746
-你救了我 -别跟我说话，我心情不好
You saved me.

1250
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:20,721
Don't talk to me. I'm not in the mood.

1251
01:25:22,164 --> 01:25:26,168
你竟然敢攻击我 我现在心情非常难过
How dare you attack me in my hour of sorrow!

1252
01:25:27,044 --> 01:25:28,504
你为什么要救我
Why did you save me?

1253
01:25:30,547 --> 01:25:32,382
因为这次是你先救我的
Because you saved me first,

1254
01:25:32,466 --> 01:25:36,136
很明显，这样给了你一个 我不明白的战术优势
which clearly gave you a tactical advantage I do not understand.

1255
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:39,848
这哪算什么战术，我不能就这样让你死掉
It wasn't a tactic. I couldn't just let you die.

1256
01:25:40,891 --> 01:25:45,604
为什么？从我们见面的第一刻开始 我就一直想解决你
Why?

1257
01:25:41,943 --> 01:25:45,213
I've been trying to destroy you since the moment we met.

1258
01:25:45,687 --> 01:25:49,608
因为只有照顾好自己 不能算是真正的英雄
Because being a hero isn't about taking care of yourself.

1259
01:25:49,691 --> 01:25:53,111
为了别人负起责任，才是真正的英雄
It's about taking responsibility for other people.

1260
01:25:55,405 --> 01:25:58,659
非常睿智，是地球古老的谚语吗？
Hmm. Wise words. An ancient Earth proverb?

1261
01:25:58,742 --> 01:26:01,161
并不是，这是华卓斯基家的格言
No, sir, that's a Wachowski family special.

1262
01:26:01,245 --> 01:26:03,247
某个划船大哥告诉我的
I got it from a guy in a rowboat.

1263
01:26:03,997 --> 01:26:05,499
他对我来说很重要
Someone who means a lot to me.

1264
01:26:07,417 --> 01:26:09,002
等等，那是什么声音？
Wait a second. What's that sound?

1265
01:26:11,171 --> 01:26:14,675
音速小子索尼克 才需要这么盛大的救援排场
Only Sonic the Hedgehog needs rescuing this much.

1266
01:26:15,843 --> 01:26:17,719
是聪明的小狐狸
That sly little fox!

1267
01:26:20,264 --> 01:26:22,599
来吧，那颗螺丝，我们还没输
Come on, Knucklehead. We're not beat yet.

1268
01:26:23,433 --> 01:26:25,936
在山上，你说过你失去了一切
On the mountain, you told me you'd lost everything.

1269
01:26:26,562 --> 01:26:28,063
我也一样
The way I did.

1270
01:26:28,146 --> 01:26:30,899
但你看起来很乐观又自在
But you seem so hopeful and free.

1271
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:35,487
你是怎么继续前进？即便你失败了一次
How did you move forward despite failing again?

1272
01:26:36,238 --> 01:26:39,366
又一次…又一次…
And again. And again. And again. And again.

1273
01:26:39,449 --> 01:26:43,078
我没失败那么多次，因为我不是自己面对
Okay, I didn't fail that much. But I didn't do this all alone.

1274
01:26:43,161 --> 01:26:45,747
我找到了新的家庭、新的朋友
I found a new family. New friends.

1275
01:26:45,831 --> 01:26:47,249
你也可以的
And you can too.

1276
01:26:49,543 --> 01:26:51,962
你不需要继续独来独往
You don't have to be alone anymore.

1277
01:26:54,882 --> 01:26:56,884
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

1278
01:26:57,050 --> 01:26:59,219
你这样算哪门子的握手
Are you kidding me with that handshake?

1279
01:27:01,847 --> 01:27:03,265
我不要再当好好先生
I'm done playing games, pal.

1280
01:27:04,933 --> 01:27:06,685
告诉我，我想知道的事
You're gonna tell me what I want to know.

1281
01:27:09,104 --> 01:27:12,482
让我再问你最后一次
And I am asking you for the last time...

1282
01:27:14,818 --> 01:27:17,279
你的贝果要涂什么果酱？
what would you like on your bagel?

1283
01:27:17,362 --> 01:27:19,281
我什么也不会说的
I'm not telling you anything.

1284
01:27:19,364 --> 01:27:22,284
更何况，那是贝果的模型
And that is a display bagel.

1285
01:27:22,367 --> 01:27:25,579
我听不懂，因为我已经受够了
I don't get it with you! I mean, I've tried everything.

1286
01:27:25,662 --> 01:27:29,291
要扮白脸，又要扮黑脸 偶尔还要当送餐小弟
I was good cop. I was bad cop.

1287
01:27:27,048 --> 01:27:29,183
I was cop who offers you a bagel.

1288
01:27:29,374 --> 01:27:30,375
却什么也问不…
And nothing. It's like...

1289
01:27:30,459 --> 01:27:32,711
真的是模型
That is a display bagel. Wow.

1290
01:27:41,970 --> 01:27:43,722
博士，你在这里
Doctor, you're here.

1291
01:27:45,724 --> 01:27:50,395
对，我在这里
Yes, I'm here, and yet I'm...

1292
01:27:51,939 --> 01:27:53,607
所以我不在那里
not all there.

1293
01:27:53,690 --> 01:27:55,192
博士，一切还好吗？
Sir, are you feeling okay?

1294
01:27:55,275 --> 01:27:59,404
我好上加好
I'm more than okay.

1295
01:28:00,030 --> 01:28:03,158
我刚升级成
I'm upgraded.

1296
01:28:03,242 --> 01:28:06,286
阴险版三点零
Sinister 3.0.

1297
01:28:06,370 --> 01:28:10,374
游戏难度提升
My game is next level.

1298
01:28:15,462 --> 01:28:16,630
嗨
Hi.

1299
01:28:19,466 --> 01:28:25,639
我能够闻到你脑子里的那股电流
I can smell the electricity in your brain.

1300
01:28:27,474 --> 01:28:29,768
你闻起来像一盘点心
You smell like a snack plate.

1301
01:28:31,186 --> 01:28:34,314
对，很有道理，我今天吃很多
Yeah, no, that's fair. I had a couple today.

1302
01:28:34,857 --> 01:28:36,316
坐下
Sit down.

1303
01:28:40,988 --> 01:28:42,406
到椅子上
In the chair.

1304
01:28:45,617 --> 01:28:46,785
我弄不懂，因为坐椅子的人是他
I didn't know.

1305
01:28:47,870 --> 01:28:50,956
所以我…好吧
'Cause he was in the chair, so I didn't... Okay.

1306
01:28:51,039 --> 01:28:52,958
博士，出了点状况
Sir? We have a problem.

1307
01:28:58,538 --> 01:29:01,641
- All teams in position! - Set up a perimeter!

1308
01:29:01,776 --> 01:29:03,643
Move! Move! Move!

1309
01:29:18,609 --> 01:29:22,237
不正确（拉丁语），我所信赖的藤壶
<i>Incorrectus, my trusty barnacle.</i>

1310
01:29:23,572 --> 01:29:26,033
经过了这么多年之后
After all these years,

1311
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:28,410
我终于找到了一个
what I finally got...

1312
01:29:29,578 --> 01:29:31,622
解决的好办法
is a solution.

1313
01:29:42,257 --> 01:29:44,134
-指挥官 -探员，报告状况
Commander. Status report.

1314
01:29:44,218 --> 01:29:47,596
蛋头和石东绑架了一个人质 好像是当地的警察
Robotnik is in there with Stone and a hostage. Possibly local PD.

1315
01:29:47,679 --> 01:29:51,058
我不是要说他笨，但他如果是当地警察
I'm not saying he's dumb, but if he is local PD,

1316
01:29:50,958 --> 01:29:53,327
this town's in a lot of trouble.

1317
01:29:53,519 --> 01:29:54,811
韦德
Wade.

1318
01:30:06,307 --> 01:30:08,008
Um...

1319
01:30:09,201 --> 01:30:10,202
好吧
Okay.

1320
01:30:11,161 --> 01:30:13,705
你这次穿的春季时装很潮
Rockin' that new spring collection, I see.

1321
01:30:13,789 --> 01:30:18,335
我记得你是酥皮大国王
Well, if it isn't the Pastry King.

1322
01:30:18,418 --> 01:30:19,545
是甜甜圈大王
The Donut Lord.

1323
01:30:20,045 --> 01:30:21,839
一个真正的天才应该要记住
A real genius would remember the name of the guy

1324
01:30:21,922 --> 01:30:23,841
把你一脚踹出地球的人叫什么名字
who helped kick your butt off this planet.

1325
01:30:23,924 --> 01:30:25,884
如果你敢惹绿丘镇我会再踹的
And I'll do it again if you mess with Green Hills.

1326
01:30:26,969 --> 01:30:30,764
还真是恭喜你拥有 这么一丝丝短暂又可悲的优越感
Congratulations on your oh-so-temporary sense of superiority.

1327
01:30:30,848 --> 01:30:33,183
你没戏唱了，蛋头，都被没收了
You're finished, Robotnik! We've taken everything.

1328
01:30:33,267 --> 01:30:35,978
实验室、无人机，还有资金
Your lab, your drones, your funding!

1329
01:30:36,061 --> 01:30:39,231
看你没有小小呆瓜机器人，你还能多自大
Let's see how big of a man you are without your silly little robots.

1330
01:30:40,983 --> 01:30:42,943
你们想看看我
Would you like to see how...

1331
01:30:44,361 --> 01:30:46,488
能自「大」到什么地步？
big a man I can be?

1332
01:30:57,374 --> 01:31:00,544
欢迎来到新常态
Welcome to the new norm.

1333
01:31:10,846 --> 01:31:12,222
天哪
My God!

1334
01:31:15,726 --> 01:31:19,438
博士，带我一起走
Doctor! Take me with you!

1335
01:31:43,879 --> 01:31:45,714
他正在摧毁一切
He's taking everything apart.

1336
01:31:46,715 --> 01:31:48,133
好像在组成什么
He's building something.

1337
01:31:56,141 --> 01:31:58,519
蛋头一定就在那附近
That can only be one thing.

1338
01:31:58,602 --> 01:32:00,979
翡翠的力量令人畏惧
The fearsome power of the Emerald.

1339
01:32:01,063 --> 01:32:05,067
如果它能把想法转变成力量 那我们的麻烦就大了
If that thing really turns thoughts into power,

1340
01:32:03,357 --> 01:32:04,959
we are in big trouble.

1341
01:32:05,150 --> 01:32:07,194
蛋头的脑袋有超多坏想法
Robotnik has a lot of bad thoughts.

1342
01:32:07,277 --> 01:32:10,239
索尼克，你确定带那一位上飞机
Hey, Sonic, are you sure it was a good idea

1343
01:32:10,322 --> 01:32:11,823
没有问题吗
bringing you-know-who aboard?

1344
01:32:11,907 --> 01:32:15,661
纳克鲁斯其实没那么坏 他只是有一点迷惘
Knuckles isn't really a bad guy. He's just a little mixed up.

1345
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:17,454
我才没有迷惘
I am not mixed up!

1346
01:32:17,538 --> 01:32:22,417
我有坚定的意志 我也很复杂，一般人不会懂我的
I have steely focus. And I'm complex.

1347
01:32:20,741 --> 01:32:22,343
And that's a lot for some people.

1348
01:32:23,252 --> 01:32:25,879
希望你没把我开车撞你的事放在心上
Hope you're not still mad I hit you with that car.

1349
01:32:26,630 --> 01:32:28,382
我当时根本毫发无伤
Pfft! I was completely uninjured.

1350
01:32:28,465 --> 01:32:31,760
而且我会在你最意想不到的时候找你算账
And my revenge will come when you least expect it, fox.

1351
01:32:58,145 --> 01:32:59,380
Whoa.

1352
01:33:03,083 --> 01:33:05,669
博士，你真是太强了
Sir, you're magnificent!

1353
01:33:05,752 --> 01:33:07,796
谢谢，你这马屁精
Thank you, sycophant.

1354
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:10,299
你会赞叹，这是当然的
Your admiration is inevitable.

1355
01:33:20,350 --> 01:33:21,810
我就知道
I knew it!

1356
01:33:21,894 --> 01:33:24,396
跟棉花糖宝宝一模一样
Just like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.

1357
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:27,524
征服世界音乐列表
World Domination playlist.

1358
01:33:40,871 --> 01:33:42,039
撤退…
Fall back.

1359
01:33:43,457 --> 01:33:46,293
快点撤退
Fall back! Quick! Retreat!

1360
01:33:48,295 --> 01:33:50,380
要怎么样才能够击败那个机器人？
How are we supposed to beat this thing?

1361
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:51,507
我们需要计划
We need a plan.

1362
01:33:51,590 --> 01:33:53,634
纳克鲁斯，用你的力量从…
Knuckles, use your strength to...

1363
01:33:54,218 --> 01:33:56,553
飞机上跳下去
Jump off the plane. Wow.

1364
01:33:56,637 --> 01:34:00,557
好吧，计划是这样子的 第一步，我们先闹一下
Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Step 1: Light taunting.

1365
01:34:00,641 --> 01:34:02,392
第二步…说真的我还没想到
Step 2: I have no idea.

1366
01:34:05,521 --> 01:34:06,688
索尼克
Sonic!

1367
01:34:09,858 --> 01:34:11,818
可动模型不错喔，蛋头
Nice action figure, Eggman.

1368
01:34:11,902 --> 01:34:14,821
它会做什么？除了丑还有其他的特色吗？
Does it do anything or just stand there looking ugly?

1369
01:34:18,492 --> 01:34:21,161
他就像水泡一样会一直回来
Like a blister, he keeps coming back!

1370
01:34:22,162 --> 01:34:25,123
他在杀戮清单上面，发射飞弹，果断一点
He's on the okay-to-kill list. Shoot the missiles. Make a decision.

1371
01:34:25,207 --> 01:34:28,001
请给我一点时间 我还在弄清楚该怎么操作
I need a moment, sir. I'm trying to figure out how to do this.

1372
01:34:28,085 --> 01:34:30,170
请问你翻过说明书了吗？
Did you even glance at a manual?

1373
01:34:30,254 --> 01:34:32,422
-不要 -让我来
No! I'll do it.

1374
01:34:32,506 --> 01:34:33,924
抱歉这么电
Pardon my lightning.

1375
01:34:34,007 --> 01:34:35,884
自己去接地一下
You might want to ground yourself.

1376
01:34:37,511 --> 01:34:38,946
Uh-oh.

1377
01:34:39,137 --> 01:34:41,682
我要把那个东西像罐头一样打开
I'm gonna pop that thing open like a can of chili...

1378
01:34:44,226 --> 01:34:45,686
坐稳
Whoa!

1379
01:34:44,084 --> 01:34:45,886
Hang on!

1380
01:34:47,621 --> 01:34:49,490
Whoa!

1381
01:34:51,892 --> 01:34:54,294
Whoa!

1382
01:34:56,964 --> 01:34:58,198
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

1383
01:34:58,991 --> 01:35:01,243
-好耶 -好险
Oh, yeah! Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Close one.

1384
01:35:02,035 --> 01:35:03,120
索尼克
Sonic!

1385
01:35:06,874 --> 01:35:08,458
蛋头
Robotnik!

1386
01:35:10,085 --> 01:35:11,587
卑鄙小人
Deceiver!

1387
01:35:11,670 --> 01:35:13,422
蚊子去死吧
Die, mosquito.

1388
01:35:25,851 --> 01:35:26,852
很有感觉
Ooh! I felt that.

1389
01:35:39,506 --> 01:35:42,176
Oh! Whoa!

1390
01:35:46,038 --> 01:35:47,497
刚才怎么回事？
What just happened?

1391
01:35:47,581 --> 01:35:50,834
那招叫胡揍飞拳，说明书上写的
It's the Stache Masher. Right here in the manual.

1392
01:35:53,128 --> 01:35:55,464
退还给寄件人
Return to sender.

1393
01:36:03,055 --> 01:36:04,389
石东？
Stone?

1394
01:36:05,891 --> 01:36:10,062
太好了，接下来你就会控诉我 对你做出职场霸凌
Oh, great.

1395
01:36:07,067 --> 01:36:10,204
Next thing you know, there'll be a report about a hostile work environment.

1396
01:36:13,148 --> 01:36:16,318
我们的招都出完了，但是完全没用
Those were our best attacks, and they did nothing!

1397
01:36:16,443 --> 01:36:20,239
只要翡翠在蛋头手上 我们就没办法赢过他，他太强大了
We can't beat Robotnik as long as he's got that Emerald.

1398
01:36:18,780 --> 01:36:20,280
He's too powerful.

1399
01:36:20,322 --> 01:36:23,408
听着，我们各自分头进行 是没办法打赢蛋头的
Look, we aren't strong enough to beat Robotnik on our own.

1400
01:36:23,492 --> 01:36:24,743
但如果我们三个一起
But there's three of us.

1401
01:36:24,826 --> 01:36:27,996
你的力气、你的才智
Your strength, your smarts and my speed.

1402
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:29,748
再加上我的速度，就能够获胜
Together. That's how we win.

1403
01:36:29,831 --> 01:36:34,294
所以我们几个一定要一起在战场上对抗他
So we make our stand here on the field of battle.

1404
01:36:34,378 --> 01:36:35,754
同心协力
As a team.

1405
01:36:35,838 --> 01:36:37,339
就是现在
This is it.

1406
01:36:38,715 --> 01:36:41,385
现在就是我们的时刻
This is our moment.

1407
01:36:43,428 --> 01:36:44,930
开打时间到
Time to fight.

1408
01:36:52,437 --> 01:36:55,858
虽然不是说这个的时候 但我还没有想到计划
Bad time to say this, but I don't actually have a plan.

1409
01:36:56,859 --> 01:36:58,694
塔尔斯，你有计划吗？
Tails, any ideas?

1410
01:36:58,777 --> 01:37:00,445
我们必须找到他的弱点
We have to find his weak spot.

1411
01:37:00,529 --> 01:37:02,155
我觉得是…鼠蹊部
I suggest the groin.

1412
01:37:02,239 --> 01:37:04,324
什么？不是，不是吧
What? No. No!

1413
01:37:04,408 --> 01:37:06,994
一般来说是的，鼠蹊部都很脆弱
Traditionally, yes, the groin is the weakest spot.

1414
01:37:07,077 --> 01:37:09,121
拜托，别再说鼠蹊部
Stop saying "groin."

1415
01:37:09,204 --> 01:37:10,998
刺猬
Hedgehog!

1416
01:37:11,081 --> 01:37:12,416
小心
Look out!

1417
01:37:15,210 --> 01:37:17,713
我知道他的弱点在哪了
I know what his weak spot is. It's me.

1418
01:37:17,796 --> 01:37:19,548
就是我，我是他的鼠蹊部
I'm the groin!

1419
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:25,137
你们想想，他满脑子想要对付我
Think about it. Whoa!

1420
01:37:23,377 --> 01:37:24,979
I live rent-free in this dude's head.

1421
01:37:25,220 --> 01:37:27,055
如果我过去继续混淆他…
So if I go out there and rile him up...

1422
01:37:27,139 --> 01:37:29,558
他就只会注意到你，不会注意到我跟狐狸
He'll focus on only you, leaving himself open

1423
01:37:29,641 --> 01:37:31,894
从两侧发动攻击
to a flanking maneuver from me and the fox!

1424
01:37:31,977 --> 01:37:34,730
刺猬，你真是勇敢又高尚的战士
Hedgehog, you are a brave and noble warrior.

1425
01:37:34,813 --> 01:37:37,482
赶快带着光荣壮烈的牺牲吧
Go to your certain death with honor.

1426
01:37:37,566 --> 01:37:40,068
我要好好教教你什么叫说好话
We're gonna have to work on your pep talks, pal.

1427
01:37:40,194 --> 01:37:41,987
-没错 -我们走
Yeah. Let's go.

1428
01:37:45,699 --> 01:37:47,326
好的，大胡仔
All right, mustache.

1429
01:37:47,409 --> 01:37:50,245
想抓我，就要眼捷手快
You want me? Come and get me.

1430
01:37:50,329 --> 01:37:53,081
轮不到你叫我眼捷手快
You don't tell me about coming and getting.

1431
01:37:53,165 --> 01:37:55,542
我可是眼捷手快的第一把交椅
I am on the cutting edge of coming and getting!

1432
01:37:55,626 --> 01:37:57,544
眼明、手快
Coming, getting.

1433
01:37:57,628 --> 01:38:01,798
眼明、手快…
Coming, getting. Coming, getting. Coming, getting.

1434
01:38:04,384 --> 01:38:06,470
你真的好重
Oh, you're really heavy.

1435
01:38:06,553 --> 01:38:10,390
因为我全身百分之百都是肌肉 狐狸，飞快点
That's because I am one million percent muscle. Faster, fox!

1436
01:38:12,601 --> 01:38:15,771
-大家快跑，这边走，快点… -撤退，大家快快快…
Go! Move, guys! Move back! Let's go, that's it! Go, go, go!

1437
01:38:15,854 --> 01:38:16,897
-不要停，走 -快走…
Keep going! Go! Go!

1438
01:38:16,980 --> 01:38:18,857
-不不不… -停车，停下卡车！
No, no! Stop! Stop the truck!

1439
01:38:18,941 --> 01:38:20,234
汤姆，发生什么事了？
Tom, what happened here?

1440
01:38:21,276 --> 01:38:23,195
-你跟我想的一样吗？ -去救我们的孩子
You thinking what I'm thinking? Let's get our kid.

1441
01:38:23,278 --> 01:38:24,655
我们要你的车
We need your truck!

1442
01:38:30,869 --> 01:38:33,080
眼明、手快…
Coming, getting. Whew!

1443
01:38:34,015 --> 01:38:35,616
Yoo-hoo!

1444
01:38:36,166 --> 01:38:38,085
你接下来计划是什么？
So what's the plan here?

1445
01:38:38,669 --> 01:38:43,048
要盖一栋大机器人的房子？ 还是娶一个大机器人老婆？
Huh?

1446
01:38:38,552 --> 01:38:40,287
You gonna build a big robot house?

1447
01:38:40,420 --> 01:38:42,724
Get yourself a big robot wife?

1448
01:38:43,131 --> 01:38:47,469
我接下来要奴役人类 强迫他们服务我的机器
I'm going to enslave humanity and force them to service my machines.

1449
01:38:47,553 --> 01:38:50,389
绿丘镇先开始，再来是宇宙
First, Green Hills. Then the universe.

1450
01:38:50,472 --> 01:38:51,723
接着是多重宇宙
Then the multiverse.

1451
01:38:51,807 --> 01:38:54,601
然后谁知道，也许就够了
Then who knows? Maybe that'll be enough.

1452
01:38:55,185 --> 01:38:56,478
顺便告诉你
Full disclosure?

1453
01:38:57,354 --> 01:38:59,940
因为到时候你早就不存在
You won't be there.

1454
01:39:04,486 --> 01:39:06,613
眼睛雷射光？真的假的？
Eye lasers? Really?

1455
01:39:19,084 --> 01:39:21,044
鼻涕火枪
Snot rocket!

1456
01:39:22,629 --> 01:39:23,672
不不不…
No, no, no!

1457
01:39:30,237 --> 01:39:33,240
Giving up already?

1458
01:39:32,181 --> 01:39:33,682
你该不会放弃了？
Not so tough when you're fighting someone 700 times your size, are ya?

1459
01:39:33,765 --> 01:39:37,477
跟比你大七百倍的人打架 就嚣张不起来了，是吗？

1460
01:39:39,605 --> 01:39:42,065
你打不过我的
You can't beat me!

1461
01:39:42,149 --> 01:39:45,319
因为我无所不知、无所不能
I'm all-powerful! All-knowing!

1462
01:39:48,071 --> 01:39:50,282
无所不见
All-seeing.

1463
01:39:51,408 --> 01:39:53,744
看样子你的酷炫机器人故障
Looks like your fancy robot has a glitch.

1464
01:39:53,827 --> 01:39:57,080
我在这里，我也在这里
Is it me? What about me? I'm over here.

1465
01:39:55,863 --> 01:39:57,698
Up top! Down below! Behind you!

1466
01:39:58,081 --> 01:40:00,000
等等，我在那边，太慢
I'm over here. Sorry! Over here.

1467
01:40:00,626 --> 01:40:01,835
我在这边，还是没打到我…
Too slow! Try again.

1468
01:40:01,919 --> 01:40:03,962
-你智取不了我 -又没打中
You can't outsmart me. Missed me again.

1469
01:40:04,046 --> 01:40:05,839
我专门智取人
I'm the outsmarter-er!

1470
01:40:10,177 --> 01:40:13,138
我不是来智取你的，我只是来让你分心的
I didn't outsmart you. I'm just the distraction.

1471
01:40:13,222 --> 01:40:14,515
蛋头博士
Robotnik!

1472
01:40:15,140 --> 01:40:17,893
我也是立体投影
I am also a hologram.

1473
01:40:17,976 --> 01:40:19,895
无情无义
Disloyal.

1474
01:40:19,978 --> 01:40:22,814
“无”有吾的本色
"Dis" is how I roll.

1475
01:40:51,218 --> 01:40:52,761
我的翡翠在哪？
Where's my Emerald?

1476
01:40:53,512 --> 01:40:55,389
不不不…
No, no, no, no!

1477
01:40:55,472 --> 01:40:57,808
主计算机，开启辅助电源
Computer, auxiliary power.

1478
01:41:05,166 --> 01:41:06,768
Oh.

1479
01:41:07,150 --> 01:41:09,403
翡翠就在那里
The Emerald. It's right there.

1480
01:41:09,945 --> 01:41:11,864
动啊，你这堆废铁
Move, you hunk of junk!

1481
01:41:16,410 --> 01:41:19,788
我一定要拿到
I have to... reach it.

1482
01:41:43,020 --> 01:41:44,021
快点…
Come on.

1483
01:41:46,190 --> 01:41:48,358
他在那一边，开过去
There he is! Go! Go, go, go!

1484
01:41:57,284 --> 01:41:58,327
可恶
No!

1485
01:41:58,410 --> 01:41:59,703
我们救到你了
We got you, Sonic.

1486
01:42:00,913 --> 01:42:02,331
坐稳
Hold on!

1487
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:17,804
-你们都还好吗？ -还好
- You guys okay? - Yeah.

1488
01:42:19,306 --> 01:42:20,349
很好
Okay.

1489
01:42:25,896 --> 01:42:27,940
我拿到翡翠了，还是能打败他
I got the Emerald. We could still defeat him.

1490
01:42:28,023 --> 01:42:31,193
快点…该怎么使用它？要怎么做？
Come on, come on. How does this thing work? What do I do?

1491
01:42:32,402 --> 01:42:33,570
什么？
What?

1492
01:42:34,238 --> 01:42:36,949
不不不…
No. No, no, no!

1493
01:42:40,827 --> 01:42:44,998
看看这个可爱又幸福的小家庭
Look at the happy little family.

1494
01:42:50,879 --> 01:42:53,382
你们要离我远一点，他的目标是我
You have to get away from me. I'm the one he wants.

1495
01:42:53,373 --> 01:42:54,641
Hey.

1496
01:42:54,967 --> 01:42:56,593
我们哪里也不会去
We're not going anywhere.

1497
01:42:57,177 --> 01:42:58,345
我们是一家人
We're family.

1498
01:43:01,932 --> 01:43:03,600
一家人就是无论如何
And families stick together...

1499
01:43:06,478 --> 01:43:07,688
都要在一起
no matter what.

1500
01:43:10,816 --> 01:43:11,942
我爱你们
I love you guys.

1501
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:14,403
我们也爱你，索尼克
We love you too, Sonic.

1502
01:43:22,911 --> 01:43:24,371
不要
No!

1503
01:43:26,415 --> 01:43:28,584
干掉他啦
I got him!

1504
01:43:28,667 --> 01:43:32,254
我终于干掉他啦
I finally got him!

1505
01:43:37,718 --> 01:43:39,469
那个又是什么？
What was that?

1506
01:44:25,349 --> 01:44:27,559
全都结束了，蛋头
It's over, Eggman.

1507
01:44:27,335 --> 01:44:31,872
I like the new look. It works for you.

1508
01:44:28,936 --> 01:44:31,647
新造型很不错，非常适合你

1509
01:44:32,231 --> 01:44:35,234
我们就让过去的事过去，这样好不好？
What do you say we just let bygones be bygones?

1510
01:44:35,317 --> 01:44:39,071
我们两个都做过一些事 彼此都算是好人嘛
I did some things, you did some things.

1511
01:44:37,044 --> 01:44:39,113
There are good people on both sides.

1512
01:44:40,781 --> 01:44:43,867
两个天才一定能把这些纷争
Surely two intelligent beings

1513
01:44:45,619 --> 01:44:47,621
全部都解决
can work these things out!

1514
01:44:59,633 --> 01:45:02,094
-加油小子，上啊 -打倒他，索尼克
Come on, buddy.

1515
01:45:00,633 --> 01:45:02,036
Get him, Sonic! Come on.

1516
01:45:02,177 --> 01:45:03,512
很好，上啊
Yeah. Come on.

1517
01:45:20,070 --> 01:45:21,530
真的要这样吗？
It's like that?

1518
01:45:23,031 --> 01:45:25,325
好吧，我们不是麻吉
Okay, we're not friends.

1519
01:45:29,746 --> 01:45:32,040
先撤退，讨厌鬼
Later, hater!

1520
01:45:43,427 --> 01:45:44,887
-索尼克 -小子
Sonic! Buddy!

1521
01:45:45,470 --> 01:45:47,514
慢着，你们不能碰他
Wait! You cannot touch him!

1522
01:45:47,598 --> 01:45:50,267
刺猬现在拥有翡翠的力量
The hedgehog holds the power of the Emerald.

1523
01:45:50,976 --> 01:45:54,563
我很遗憾 他再也不是你们认识的索尼克了
I am sorry. He is no longer the Sonic you once knew.

1524
01:45:55,147 --> 01:45:56,148
什么？
What?

1525
01:46:14,574 --> 01:46:15,709
Mmm.

1526
01:46:16,084 --> 01:46:17,711
你们一定要试试看
Oh, you got to try this.

1527
01:46:23,467 --> 01:46:26,803
好吧，他就是你们认识的那个索尼克
Okay. He is exactly the Sonic you once knew.

1528
01:46:28,588 --> 01:46:30,124
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

1529
01:46:38,524 --> 01:46:39,608
索尼克
Sonic! Whoa!

1530
01:46:41,944 --> 01:46:43,487
抱一个，小子
Bring it in, bud.

1531
01:46:44,947 --> 01:46:46,907
能变回蓝色真好
It's good to be back in blue.

1532
01:46:46,990 --> 01:46:50,327
金光闪闪是很帅啦 但蓝色还是比较适合我
The golden god thing was fun, but blue has always been more my color.

1533
01:46:50,410 --> 01:46:51,495
这样好看
Looks good on you.

1534
01:46:51,578 --> 01:46:57,000
索尼克，你原本可以成为 宇宙中最强的英雄，但是你放弃了
Sonic, you were the most powerful hero

1535
01:46:54,181 --> 01:46:56,984
in the universe, and you let it go.

1536
01:46:57,084 --> 01:46:58,168
为什么？
Why?

1537
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:03,048
因为我还有很大的成长空间
Because I still have some growing up to do.

1538
01:47:05,300 --> 01:47:09,054
-而且当个孩子也不赖 -而且你不是普通的孩子
And I kind of like being a kid.

1539
01:47:07,595 --> 01:47:09,430
And you're not just any kid.

1540
01:47:09,638 --> 01:47:11,515
是我们的孩子
You're our kid.

1541
01:47:11,598 --> 01:47:13,016
说的对
That's right.

1542
01:47:13,100 --> 01:47:15,811
-抱一个 -抱抱
Bring it in! Yay. Hugs.

1543
01:47:15,894 --> 01:47:18,730
幸好你们刚才没来抱我，不然早就炸飞了
It's a good thing we didn't do this before. You would've blown up.

1544
01:47:26,363 --> 01:47:27,948
你修好了
Whoa! You fixed it.

1545
01:47:28,031 --> 01:47:31,368
我这辈子一直都在寻找这个东西
I've spent my whole life questing for this.

1546
01:47:31,451 --> 01:47:32,744
现在我找到了
Now I have it.

1547
01:47:32,828 --> 01:47:34,621
我们找到了
Now we have it.

1548
01:47:34,705 --> 01:47:37,291
该拿它怎么办，接下来呢？
What do we do with it? What next?

1549
01:47:37,374 --> 01:47:39,501
原本有两派英雄保护银河系
There were once two orders of heroes

1550
01:47:39,585 --> 01:47:43,714
他们要避免有人拿到翡翠作乱 让银河系受到伤害
who protected the galaxy from those who would use the Emerald for evil.

1551
01:47:43,797 --> 01:47:47,676
但现在他们都已经在天上的巨大战场了
But they have all passed on to the great battleground in the sky.

1552
01:47:47,759 --> 01:47:51,221
那我们自成新的一派，就我们三个
So we start a new order. The three of us.

1553
01:47:51,305 --> 01:47:53,015
这任务不容小觑
This is no light task.

1554
01:47:53,098 --> 01:47:57,728
一定要在此承诺 运用我们的力量守护整个宇宙的安全
We must make a vow to use our powers to keep the universe safe,

1555
01:47:58,562 --> 01:48:00,397
并且要照顾彼此
to watch out for each other.

1556
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:02,191
我们的新部落
Our new tribe.

1557
01:48:02,274 --> 01:48:03,400
我知道了，击个拳
Oh, I know!

1558
01:48:03,483 --> 01:48:05,903
好主意
A power bump!

1559
01:48:04,818 --> 01:48:06,487
Good idea.

1560
01:48:06,945 --> 01:48:10,157
这是地球的习俗，代表坚不可摧的承诺
It's an Earth custom. An unbreakable promise.

1561
01:48:10,741 --> 01:48:12,034
没有问题
Very well.

1562
01:48:12,826 --> 01:48:15,245
我们就来击个拳
A power bump it is.

1563
01:48:16,413 --> 01:48:18,081
击个拳
Power bump!

1564
01:48:22,002 --> 01:48:26,131
今天晴空万里 真是一个在绿丘镇打棒球的好日子
It's truly a beautiful day

1565
01:48:23,737 --> 01:48:25,906
for baseball here in Green Hills.

1566
01:48:26,215 --> 01:48:27,925
阵容非常令人期待
An exciting lineup today

1567
01:48:28,008 --> 01:48:31,303
首次亮相的还有两位新球员
with the debut appearance of two new players!

1568
01:48:31,386 --> 01:48:35,557
投手丘上站着来自银河系的亮眼新秀
On the mound, rookie sensation from across the galaxy,

1569
01:48:35,641 --> 01:48:38,185
迈尔斯“塔尔斯”普洛尔
Miles "Tails" Prower,

1570
01:48:38,268 --> 01:48:42,981
他对上的是肌力满满的针鼹纳克鲁斯
facing off against the powerhouse, Knuckles the Echidna.

1571
01:48:44,441 --> 01:48:46,318
我不太明白
Um, I don't understand.

1572
01:48:46,401 --> 01:48:48,570
为什么要对敌人的球生气
Why am I angry at the enemy ball?

1573
01:48:48,654 --> 01:48:49,821
不需要生气
You're not angry.

1574
01:48:49,905 --> 01:48:53,158
只需要你尽全力打出去 然后跑过所有垒包
You just want to hit it as hard as you can

1575
01:48:51,732 --> 01:48:52,933
and then run around the bases.

1576
01:48:53,242 --> 01:48:57,871
可是如果我已经站在我要去的位置 为什么还要跑？
But if my quest ends where I am standing,

1577
01:48:56,403 --> 01:48:57,805
why run at all?

1578
01:48:58,539 --> 01:49:01,083
受不了这家伙，我干嘛找自己麻烦
Ugh. I can't with this guy. Why do I even try?

1579
01:49:01,166 --> 01:49:03,836
这只是一场游戏，全都是为了好玩
This is just a game. We're out here having fun.

1580
01:49:03,919 --> 01:49:05,420
只是好玩而已
Just having some fun.

1581
01:49:05,504 --> 01:49:06,922
好玩？
Fun. Huh.

1582
01:49:08,131 --> 01:49:10,509
很好，投个快球，塔尔斯
All right! Give him the heat, Tails!

1583
01:49:10,592 --> 01:49:12,511
准备好接我的快速球了吗？
Hope you're ready for my fastball.

1584
01:49:12,594 --> 01:49:15,097
你的快速球会无地自容
Your fastball will be dishonored.

1585
01:49:15,180 --> 01:49:17,391
你也一样，狐狸
And so will you, fox.

1586
01:49:17,474 --> 01:49:19,852
-大家放轻松点 -不需要想太多
Easy, guys!

1587
01:49:19,935 --> 01:49:23,355
把手肘好好稳住 眼睛看好球，送它去兜风
Don't think about it too much.

1588
01:49:19,994 --> 01:49:21,895
Just keep your elbow up, eye on the ball

1589
01:49:23,438 --> 01:49:24,857
兜风？去哪里？
and give it a ride.

1590
01:49:23,430 --> 01:49:24,999
A ride? To where?

1591
01:49:29,069 --> 01:49:30,404
击个拳
Power bump!

1592
01:49:35,701 --> 01:49:37,160
胜利属于我
Ha! Victory is mine!

1593
01:49:37,244 --> 01:49:39,788
不公平，这样不算吧
Hey, no fair! That shouldn't count.

1594
01:49:39,872 --> 01:49:42,124
第一垒，同样也是我的
First base is also mine!

1595
01:49:42,207 --> 01:49:46,795
-我们只有那颗球 -我占了第二垒
I think that was our only ball.

1596
01:49:43,884 --> 01:49:46,654
I have conquered the second of the bases!

1597
01:49:46,879 --> 01:49:48,422
好吧，谁想吃冰淇淋？
Who wants ice cream?

1598
01:49:48,505 --> 01:49:49,715
你的力气好大
Knocked the cover off that.

1599
01:49:49,798 --> 01:49:51,717
-冰淇淋 -冰淇淋，耶
Ice cream! Ice cream, yeah!

1600
01:49:52,968 --> 01:49:56,430
我终于得到“好玩”，什么是冰淇淋？
I am having the fun! What is ice cream?

1601
01:49:56,513 --> 01:49:59,850
是一种点心 如果你喜欢好玩，也会喜欢它
It's a dessert. If you like fun, you're gonna love it.

1602
01:49:59,933 --> 01:50:03,103
好吃，点心？里面有葡萄吗?
Oh, yum. Dessert. Does it have grapes in it?

1603
01:50:03,187 --> 01:50:04,771
没，一般来说没有
No, not usually.

1604
01:50:04,855 --> 01:50:06,523
我以他们为荣
I'm proud of our little guy.

1605
01:50:07,399 --> 01:50:10,444
我很喜欢他的新朋友 尤其是红色那一位
I really like his new friends, especially the red one.

1606
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:13,572
-让我很开心 -还很会挥棒
He cracks me up. Heck of a swing too.

1607
01:50:13,655 --> 01:50:16,408
来吧狐狸，点心冒险在等着我们
Come on, fox.

1608
01:50:14,882 --> 01:50:16,517
Our dessert adventure awaits. Whoo!

1609
01:50:16,491 --> 01:50:17,826
-打得漂亮 -对啊
Good job, guys. Yeah.

1610
01:50:17,910 --> 01:50:21,205
你也是，宝贝 我们去吃冰淇淋 走，走吧
You too, baby.

1611
01:50:19,253 --> 01:50:22,056
Let's go get some ice cream. Come on, come on.

1612
01:50:22,372 --> 01:50:24,541
我真的很为你高兴
I'm happy for you, pal.

1613
01:50:24,625 --> 01:50:27,794
找到两个朋友，很适合一起成长
Got your wingmen.

1614
01:50:26,126 --> 01:50:27,461
Perfect friends to grow up with.

1615
01:50:27,878 --> 01:50:31,173
-上车，纳克鲁斯 -我的胜利战车
Come on, Knuckles. Ah! My victory chariot!

1616
01:50:33,217 --> 01:50:36,178
我得到的不只这些，老爹
I've got a lot more than that... Dad.

1617
01:50:41,642 --> 01:50:42,976
看谁先跑到那
Race you to the truck.

1618
01:50:44,645 --> 01:50:46,063
一二三，冲
One, two, three, go!

1619
01:50:46,647 --> 01:50:48,774
不能放水，我要你使出全力
No, don't go easy on me. I want your best.

1620
01:50:48,857 --> 01:50:51,818
索尼克，刚听说冰淇淋会加巧克力米
Sonic, I have just been told they have sprinkles.

1621
01:50:51,902 --> 01:50:55,572
冰淇淋加巧克力米？ 这就是你下一个要守护的
Ice cream and sprinkles? This is your new destiny.

1622
01:50:55,656 --> 01:51:00,577
我在棒子球上赢了你 很适合用冰淇淋当做庆祝大餐
What a perfect meal to celebrate my victory over you in base of ball.

1623
01:51:00,661 --> 01:51:03,288
-什么？ -说真的，你没打败我
What? I mean, you barely beat me.

1624
01:51:03,956 --> 01:51:06,458
你从没被打得那么惨过
Ha! You've never been beaten so hard.

1625
01:51:10,879 --> 01:51:12,047
不能忘了这个
Can't forget this.

1626
01:51:15,476 --> 01:51:17,746
<i>? Say I might And sail tonight ?</i>

1627
01:51:17,878 --> 01:51:21,281
<i>? I'm home ?</i>

1628
01:51:21,415 --> 01:51:23,684
<i>? Say right now, I'll get it ?</i>

1629
01:51:23,818 --> 01:51:28,857
<i>? Take my hand, come zone ?</i>

1630
01:51:28,989 --> 01:51:30,524
<i>? Come on, catch a ride ?</i>

1631
01:51:30,657 --> 01:51:34,194
<i>? And we take it to places That we only dreamed ?</i>

1632
01:51:34,328 --> 01:51:36,296
<i>? I think I'm home ?</i>

1633
01:51:36,430 --> 01:51:38,232
<i>? This is my heaven, baby ?</i>

1634
01:51:38,365 --> 01:51:44,071
<i>? Day and night in my zone ?</i>

1635
01:51:44,204 --> 01:51:46,206
<i>? The feeling Flows through me ?</i>

1636
01:51:46,340 --> 01:51:47,908
<i>? Heaven's where we meet ?</i>

1637
01:51:48,041 --> 01:51:51,578
<i>? Happy we lovin' We lovin' our lives ?</i>

1638
01:51:51,713 --> 01:51:55,215
<i>? Things I wished to see Seem to come to be ?</i>

1639
01:51:55,349 --> 01:51:58,051
<i>? I seek the truth, I'm honest Hey ?</i>

1640
01:51:58,185 --> 01:52:01,288
<i>? The moon is singin' our song ?</i>

1641
01:52:02,139 --> 01:52:03,015
（蛋头？）
<i>? Say we find What we're searchin' for ?</i>

1642
01:52:03,098 --> 01:52:04,808
（哈，刺猬，你想念我吗？）
<i>? The love that we holdin' ?</i>

1643
01:52:06,026 --> 01:52:08,395
<i>? Another adventure unfolds ?</i>

1644
01:52:08,529 --> 01:52:10,732
<i>? I been dreamin' about it Yeah ?</i>

1645
01:52:10,865 --> 01:52:13,033
<i>? Dreamin' about it ?</i>

1646
01:52:13,167 --> 01:52:14,968
<i>? Goin' for it ?</i>

1647
01:52:15,102 --> 01:52:18,038
<i>? I'm out, I'm rollin' Till the stars in the sky ?</i>

1648
01:52:18,172 --> 01:52:20,207
<i>? Babe, I'm home ?</i>

1649
01:52:20,340 --> 01:52:22,142
<i>? In the city ?</i>

1650
01:52:22,276 --> 01:52:25,245
<i>? I'm out, I'm rollin' Till the stars in the sky ?</i>

1651
01:52:25,379 --> 01:52:27,080
<i>? Babe, I'm home ?</i>

1652
01:52:27,214 --> 01:52:30,284
<i>? Say I might And sail tonight ?</i>

1653
01:52:30,417 --> 01:52:34,354

01:52:43,363 --> 01:52:47,034
<i>? And we take it to places That we only dreamed ?</i>

1658
01:52:47,167 --> 01:52:49,436
<i>? I think I'm home ?</i>

1659
01:52:49,570 --> 01:52:51,071
<i>? This is my heaven, baby ?</i>

1660
01:52:51,205 --> 01:52:56,343
<i>? Day and night in my zone ?</i>

1661
01:52:56,477 --> 01:53:00,080
<i>? We are free of worries ?</i>

1662
01:53:00,214 --> 01:53:01,749
<i>? Stressin' aside ?</i>

1663
01:53:01,883 --> 01:53:04,117

1664
01:53:04,251 --> 01:53:08,622
<i>? Free, no worries at all ?</i>

1665
01:53:11,416 --> 01:53:13,293
探员，报告进度
Agent, I want an update.

1666
01:53:13,377 --> 01:53:16,296
还在继续搜查，目前没有任何蛋头的迹象
Still searching, sir. We haven't found any sign of Robotnik.

1667
01:53:16,380 --> 01:53:18,715
没人能从那种冲击下幸存
No one could've survived that crash.

1668
01:53:18,799 --> 01:53:21,385
他完蛋了，一路好走
He's toast. Good riddance.

1669
01:53:21,969 --> 01:53:24,721
那个疯子制造出这么大的混乱
What a mess that lunatic made.

1670
01:53:25,305 --> 01:53:28,183
长官，还有其他发现
Sir, there's something else.

1671
01:53:28,725 --> 01:53:32,229
我们把蛋头从数据库清除的时候 发现一样东西
When we were wiping Robotnik off our database, we found something.

1672
01:53:32,312 --> 01:53:36,066
有个档案深深埋在 我们的系统当中长达五十年
A file buried deep in our system and dating back over 50 years.

1673
01:53:36,149 --> 01:53:39,069
-什么档案？ -一个坐标，长官
What was it?

1674
01:53:39,194 --> 01:53:41,029
坐标？什么坐标？
Coordinates, sir.

1675
01:53:39,052 --> 01:53:40,889
Coordinates? To what?

1676
01:53:41,780 --> 01:53:43,740
