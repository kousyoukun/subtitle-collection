1
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:50,377
Doctor's log.

2
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,915
It's day 243 in this...

3
00:01:54,048 --> 00:01:56,516
portobello purgatory.

4
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,419
My only companion
is a rock I named Stone.

5
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:06,060
The question is,
for whom am I narrating this?

6
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:11,531
<i>It seems I've become a featured
player in the theater of the absurd.</i>

7
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:14,702
<i>Marooned in deep space
by that wretched blue rodent.</i>

8
00:02:14,836 --> 00:02:16,570
<i>But it's all good,</i>

9
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:19,207
<i>thanks to a breathable atmosphere
and my supreme intellect,</i>

10
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:22,676
<i>sharpened against the only
competitor savvy enough to bring it.</i>

11
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,146
Chanterelle to d4. Mmm.

12
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:28,548
<i>I've been striving to make fungi
into a functional drink of choice...</i>

13
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:30,151
Mushroom coffee.

14
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,588
<i>With limited...</i>

15
00:02:35,857 --> 00:02:36,924
<i>limited...</i>

16
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,393
<i>limited...</i>

17
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:42,429
<i>success.</i>

18
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:48,169
<i>But today, day 243,</i>

19
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:51,605
<i>has brought a new optimism
to my most pressing endeavor...</i>

20
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:56,744
<i>Planetus exodus to returnicus
and kick blue butticus.</i>

21
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,119
If my calculations are correct,

22
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:09,090
and there's no reason to say
"if" because they always are...

23
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:13,493
this quill is going to power
my masterpiece.

24
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:16,998
Let's light this candle...

25
00:03:18,366 --> 00:03:21,568
and see who comes
a-knockin'.

26
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:28,501
Greetings!

27
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:36,676
<i>Klaatu barada nikto.</i>

28
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:48,889
Agent Stone? Now!

29
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:00,067
Thank you, Stone.

30
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:06,807
It's time to say goodbye to
this piece-of-shiitake planet!

31
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:17,985
Huh?

32
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:33,768
Where did you get that?

33
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:40,174
From a little blue menace
on the planet called Earth.

34
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:45,012
I'd be happy
to show you the way.

35
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:09,569
Oh.

36
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:20,981
They're still on us.

37
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:23,451
This'll slow 'em down.

00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,611
Watch out. Excuse me.
Pardon me. Coming through.

44
00:06:53,314 --> 00:06:55,349
Good evening, gentlemen.
Mind if I drive?

45
00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:59,353
Better buckle up.

46
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:08,963
How we doing back there?

47
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,298
And now this way.

48
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:16,937
Whoo-hoo!

49
00:07:20,141 --> 00:07:22,309
Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't speak duct tape.

50
00:07:23,711 --> 00:07:25,846
What the heck are you?
Fear not, citizen.

51
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,917
I am the hero you need
and the hero you deserve.

52
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,553
The blue dawn
that banishes the darkest...

53
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:34,288
Holy crap!

54
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:38,826
Don't worry.

55
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,861
Nobody's gonna get hurt.

56
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:47,468
Huh. What are
those? Bombs. Bombs.

57
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:48,841
They're bombs! Those are bombs!

58
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,038
Relax. They're not even lit.

59
00:07:51,172 --> 00:07:54,942
So I'll say again,
nobody's gonna get...

60
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,945
I was wrong! We're
all gonna die!

61
00:08:00,181 --> 00:08:01,615
Why aren't you slowing down?

62
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:03,784
That would require brakes.

63
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:08,088
Oh, it's hot. Hot, hot, hot!

64
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:10,022
Why don't you just let
the police handle this?

65
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:13,260
Because that's not
what heroes do.

66
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:19,233
Thank you very much.
Please hold your applause.

67
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,273
Do you hear that?
There's one bomb left.

68
00:08:26,407 --> 00:08:28,542
Uh... Uh-oh.

69
00:08:28,676 --> 00:08:29,843
Did you check under the seat?

70
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:31,779
Of course I checked
under the seat!

71
00:08:33,147 --> 00:08:34,648
You are terrible at this!

72
00:08:34,782 --> 00:08:37,785
You know what? Your negative
attitude is not helping anyone.

73
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:40,120
It's in your spiky things!

74
00:08:41,155 --> 00:08:44,458
Ha! I can never find
anything in here.

75
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:48,629
Drained it from downtown!

76
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:51,365
See? I told you
nobody would get hurt.

77
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:55,869
Holy sherbet!

78
00:08:57,706 --> 00:08:58,806
Oh, hello.

79
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:01,909
Don't panic.
This is only a drill.

80
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:44,885
Come here!

81
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:47,722
No need to thank me, citizens.

82
00:09:47,855 --> 00:09:50,691
All in a night's work for...

83
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:53,427
Blue Justice!

84
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,329
You're a terrible hero!

Morning, Sonic!

00:10:14,248 --> 00:10:16,950
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

Oh, come on.

Uh-oh. Uh...

Oh, Sonic.

96
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:05,999
I miss you, Longclaw.

97
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:08,569
I'm trying to make you proud.

98
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:21,648
And now
for a little shut-eye.

99
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:25,619
Oh! Blech!

100
00:11:25,754 --> 00:11:27,254
Ozzy, morning breath!

101
00:11:27,388 --> 00:11:29,256
Sonic. Are you still in bed?

102
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,892
You're supposed
to meet Tom, remember?

103
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:37,431
All right, all right,
I'm up! I'm up.

104
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:40,234
What a day.

105
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,536
Whoo!

106
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:44,706
Thanks for coming out, bud.

107
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:46,240
You know,
I feel like you and me,

108
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,542
we haven't had
much time together lately.

109
00:11:50,745 --> 00:11:52,980
How's it going over there?
You getting any bites?

110
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,389
I can't swim! Help!

111
00:12:02,523 --> 00:12:04,658
If I die,
don't look in my closet!

112
00:12:04,793 --> 00:12:07,027
Hey, hey, you're good.
You're all right. Come on.

113
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:08,362
It's freezing.

114
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:10,799
All right, okay. Take it easy.

115
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:14,935
All right. You're good. Okay.

116
00:12:18,372 --> 00:12:21,008
But now that you've had
a nap and a bath...

117
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:25,612
<i>I went up to your room last night to
bring you some new comics and, um...</i>

118
00:12:29,818 --> 00:12:31,818
<i>Whoa, whoa,
whoa. Stop right there.</i>

119
00:12:31,886 --> 00:12:33,287
<i>I wouldn't come any closer,</i>

120
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,857
<i>because this little hedgehog
had way too many chili dogs.</i>

121
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:37,624
<i>Oh, no. Oh, no.</i>

122
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,027
<i>I'm so embarrassed.
Get out of here quick!</i>

123
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,496
<i>Oh, no, here comes another one!</i>

124
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,398
<i>Go. Now. Save yourself.</i>

125
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:47,110
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop
right there. I wouldn't come any closer,</i>

126
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:50,337
<i>because this little
hedgehog had way too many chili dogs.</i>

127
00:12:50,471 --> 00:12:52,272
<i>Oh, no. Oh, no.</i>

128
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:54,141
<i>I'm so embarrassed.
Get out of here...</i>

129
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,643
Ugh! I knew I should've
used real farts.

130
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,114
How many times
are we gonna do this?

131
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:03,761
What? Cast your line and not
catch anything? Seems like a billion.

132
00:13:03,785 --> 00:13:06,220
I think you know
what I'm talking about.

133
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:08,756
The lying. The sneaking out.

134
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,157
The pretending to be Batman.

135
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,893
Blue Justice, trademark pending.

136
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,236
Whatever. You're being reckless.

137
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,362
Ugh!
Not this conversation again.

138
00:13:15,496 --> 00:13:17,164
Hey. It's no fun for me, either.

139
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,675
But if you keep
being irresponsible,

140
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:20,339
we're gonna keep
having this conversation.

141
00:13:20,434 --> 00:13:22,202
How is it irresponsible
to use my powers?

142
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:25,305
Sonic, you destroyed
an entire city block!

143
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:27,040
That block
was already messed up.

144
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:28,308
Who cares?

145
00:13:28,442 --> 00:13:31,813
Look, I stopped a robbery.
I was a hero.

146
00:13:31,946 --> 00:13:35,315
No, you put people in danger
and that's not what a hero does.

147
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:40,621
You're supposed
to be my friend.

148
00:13:40,755 --> 00:13:42,289
Stop trying to be my dad.

149
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:48,930
I can take care of myself.

150
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:51,365
Sonic, taking care of yourself

151
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,467
is not what being
a hero's all about.

152
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,270
It's about taking
responsibility for other people.

153
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:58,840
And right now,
whether you want to hear this or not,

154
00:13:58,973 --> 00:14:00,140
you are still just a kid.

155
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:02,442
You got some more
growing up to do

156
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:04,779
before you're ready
to be the big hero.

157
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:06,948
But trust me when I tell you,

158
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,751
there will come a time when
your powers will be needed.

159
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:14,288
But you don't choose
that moment.

160
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:16,123
That moment chooses you.

161
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:19,126
Whoa. Look at you.

162
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:21,996
Look at that.
I just got goose bumps.

163
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:23,774
Wait a second.
Did you steal that from Oprah?

164
00:14:23,798 --> 00:14:26,968
No, sir. That is
a Wachowski family special.

165
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,535
Came from my dad,

166
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:31,005
in this very boat,
on this very lake.

167
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:35,175
He would always try and steer me
in the right direction.

168
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:37,845
And that's what Maddie and I
have always tried to do with you.

169
00:14:39,013 --> 00:14:42,884
So, until your moment arrives,

170
00:14:43,017 --> 00:14:45,787
I want you to work on
being a little more responsible.

171
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,422
<i>Comprende?</i>

172
00:14:49,023 --> 00:14:50,457
<i>Comprende.</i>

173
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:52,794
High five on it.

174
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:56,597
Yeah! Donut Lord and the
Blue Blur are back at it again!

175
00:14:56,731 --> 00:14:58,165
Hang on.

176
00:14:58,298 --> 00:14:59,333
Speedboat!

177
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:01,435
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

178
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:04,237
Sonic!

179
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:06,640
Whoo-hoo!

180
00:15:06,774 --> 00:15:10,712
How excited are you,
going to Hawaii with me? Oh, Hawaii.

181
00:15:10,845 --> 00:15:12,880
Oh, yeah!

182
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:15,382
Wow.

183
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:18,552
Welcome to Sonic Air,
the fastest way to travel.

184
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:20,120
Now boarding groups one and two.

185
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,689
Oh!

186
00:15:22,824 --> 00:15:24,993
Sonic, this is so fun!

187
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,485
I'm sorry, ma'am,
you're group three. Please wait your turn.

188
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,296
Anyone from groups one and two?

189
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,229
Just let him get it out
of his system. Nobody?

190
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,600
Okay, then everybody else
right this way.

191
00:15:33,735 --> 00:15:34,601
Thank you.

192
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,844
And you, sir?

193
00:15:42,977 --> 00:15:44,244
Terrible shirt detected.

194
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:45,579
There we go.

195
00:15:45,713 --> 00:15:47,715
Okay, you're free to go.
Enjoy your trip.

196
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:49,182
Bye-bye now.

197
00:15:49,316 --> 00:15:51,251
Okay.

198
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:53,087
Bring it in.

199
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,957
Tom, I'm about to be hedgehog
of the house for the first time.

200
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,358
I think I'm a little mature
to hug you goodbye.

201
00:15:58,492 --> 00:16:01,328
Okay,
what about a power bump? Power bump?

202
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:02,864
Yes, power bump.

203
00:16:02,997 --> 00:16:04,065
That's more like it.

204
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:06,299
Wachowski!

205
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,568
Okay, use this one
to get back home.

206
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,337
Oh!

207
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,007
All right, we're off. Be good.

208
00:16:13,141 --> 00:16:15,076
Yes. You have our number.

209
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,955
Sorry! Can't hear you! You're traveling
through a cross-dimensional portal!

210
00:16:17,979 --> 00:16:19,246
Miss you already! Okay?

211
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:21,281
Have fun at Rachel's wedding!

212
00:16:22,717 --> 00:16:24,719
Okay, it's 48 hours
until they come back.

213
00:16:24,852 --> 00:16:26,586
We've got TV channels,
streaming channels,

00:16:26,721 --> 00:16:28,655

If these readings
are accurate, he's here.

243
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:03,316
I found him!

244
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,787
I just hope I'm not too late.

245
00:18:23,637 --> 00:18:25,039
Hmm. He's close.

246
00:18:25,173 --> 00:18:27,708
I just need a way to reach
him without being spotted.

247
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:32,280
Standard human transport.
Perfect.

00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:54,568
<i>- How's it going, bud?
- Oh, you know.</i>

255
00:18:54,702 --> 00:18:57,705
Just a quiet night at home,
settling in with a good book.

256
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:58,973
<i>And you? What's up with you?</i>

257
00:18:59,106 --> 00:19:00,842
I was just calling
to say we're here.

258
00:19:00,975 --> 00:19:03,778
<i>But now every word out of your
mouth is making me suspicious.</i>

259
00:19:03,911 --> 00:19:08,548
What? You got to relax,
buddy. You're at the Four Seasons Oahu.

260
00:19:08,682 --> 00:19:10,952
Have a Mai Tai.
Enjoy some time with your wife.

261
00:19:11,085 --> 00:19:13,087
Get sunburned
somewhere embarrassing.

262
00:19:13,221 --> 00:19:15,488
<i>This weekend is about you.</i>

263
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:18,226
You know what? You're right.
We power-bumped on it.

264
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:19,794
So whatever it is you're doing,

265
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:22,096
I'm sure you can undo it
by the time we get home, yeah?

266
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:26,868
<i>Exactly! I mean,
I am deeply offended by such accusations!</i>

267
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:28,803
<i>So, how's Rachel's fiancé?</i>

268
00:19:28,936 --> 00:19:31,305
<i>Is he as good-looking in
person as he is in pictures?</i>

269
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:33,373
Hey, baby.

270
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,408
Somehow better-looking.

271
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:38,462
<i>Wow! You're about to be the
third best-looking dude in the family.</i>

272
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,214
<i>But, hey, still on the podium.</i>

273
00:19:40,348 --> 00:19:41,615
Ha-ha-ha.

274
00:19:41,749 --> 00:19:44,517
All right,
I better go and introduce myself.

275
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:46,053
<i>Stay out of trouble.</i>

276
00:19:46,187 --> 00:19:47,654
Trouble? Don't worry.

277
00:19:47,788 --> 00:19:50,490
Everything here
is completely normal.

278
00:19:50,624 --> 00:19:52,860
Uh-huh. Night, bud.

279
00:19:52,994 --> 00:19:54,795
Hey! I was just
coming over to say hi.

280
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:56,630
You've got a lot
of nerve coming up in here

281
00:19:56,764 --> 00:19:59,166
after what you did
to my fiancée.

282
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,068
Wait. What? Totaling her car?

283
00:20:01,202 --> 00:20:02,569
Leaving her tied to a chair?

284
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:04,205
I should rip you limb from limb.

285
00:20:08,376 --> 00:20:09,944
Oh, my God, look at your face!

286
00:20:10,077 --> 00:20:11,946
Tommy, breathe, baby.
Breathe. I was kidding.

287
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:14,447
Hey, man,
I was totally kidding. Okay.

288
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:17,617
You were kidding. Yeah.

289
00:20:17,752 --> 00:20:19,186
I'm sorry.
Rachel put me up to it.

290
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,122
It was totally her idea.

291
00:20:21,255 --> 00:20:22,489
That rascal.

292
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:24,392
Listen, I don't know
if you're aware.

293
00:20:25,126 --> 00:20:27,427
Rachel does not care
for you at all.

294
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,695
Oh, I'm aware. Yeah.

295
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:31,464
Seriously, bro,
you got work to do.

296
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:32,934
Hey! Hey.

297
00:20:33,067 --> 00:20:35,435
Good to see you!
Thanks for coming, Tom.

298
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,838
Really glad you came. Really?

299
00:20:38,372 --> 00:20:39,472
Uh...

300
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:41,541
Great to see you, too.
Congratulations.

301
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:43,978
I mean, you guys seem
really happy together.

302
00:20:44,111 --> 00:20:45,913
You know, you're all right,
Thomas Wachowski.

303
00:20:46,047 --> 00:20:47,047
Ah.

304
00:20:47,148 --> 00:20:48,581
Can we Bury the hatchet?

305
00:20:48,716 --> 00:20:50,151
I'd love that.

306
00:20:50,284 --> 00:20:51,618
Yeah? Yeah.

307
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:54,088
All right,
bring it in! All right! Great.

308
00:20:54,221 --> 00:20:57,858
Oh. And if you screw up my wedding,
I will end you.

309
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:04,531
All right, Ozzy,
it's movie night at Casa de Sonic,

310
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:05,900
and it's your turn to pick.

311
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:08,501
<i>But I am not watching
Snow Dogs again.</i>

312
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:11,305
That movie is the worst!

313
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,776
Blackout!

314
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:19,113
Ozzy!

315
00:21:19,246 --> 00:21:21,816
Oh, sorry, buddy.
Everything's okay.

316
00:21:22,582 --> 00:21:23,985
Whoa!

317
00:21:28,022 --> 00:21:32,393
Uh, excuse me.
We did not order a poltergeist.

318
00:21:41,268 --> 00:21:45,638
Um, if this is the pizza guy,
this is really unprofessional.

319
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:04,458
Eggman?

320
00:22:08,129 --> 00:22:11,098
Hello, hedgehog.

321
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:13,768
Did you miss me?

322
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:16,437
I don't know how you got back,

323
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:19,240
but you made
a big mistake coming here.

324
00:22:19,373 --> 00:22:22,575
<i>Au contraire, mon frère.</i>

325
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:25,012
The mistake
was thinking you'd won.

326
00:22:25,146 --> 00:22:27,647
But that was just a prelude,
an hors d'oeuvre,

327
00:22:27,782 --> 00:22:30,051
an aperitif, an amuse-bouche.

328
00:22:30,184 --> 00:22:31,352
I get it.

329
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,422
I don't think you do.

330
00:22:34,554 --> 00:22:36,257
But you're about to.

331
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:39,260
And so will that idiot
sheriff and his wife.

332
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,563
And your little dog too!

333
00:23:02,483 --> 00:23:03,551
Pitiful.

334
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:06,619
What? Who are you?

335
00:23:07,755 --> 00:23:10,758
Where are my manners?

336
00:23:11,292 --> 00:23:14,528
Sonic, meet Knuckles.

337
00:23:14,661 --> 00:23:16,764
My new BFFAE.

338
00:23:16,897 --> 00:23:20,134
Bestest friend forever and ever!

339
00:23:20,267 --> 00:23:23,504
Look, Robotnik, I don't care
who you brought to help you.

340
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:25,439
You're never going
to get my power.

341
00:23:25,573 --> 00:23:28,175
Do I look like
I need your power?

342
00:23:38,486 --> 00:23:42,189
So nice when diabolical evil
lives up to the hype.

343
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,061
Where is it?

344
00:23:47,194 --> 00:23:50,364
Oh, you want it? Here it comes.

345
00:23:50,498 --> 00:23:53,666
I was expecting more of you.

346
00:23:53,801 --> 00:23:55,236
You're unskilled.

347
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,338
Untrained.

348
00:23:58,739 --> 00:24:01,242
And unworthy!

349
00:24:02,576 --> 00:24:06,247
You forgot one. Unstoppable.

350
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:35,576
It is my destiny to do
what my ancestors could not...

351
00:24:35,709 --> 00:24:40,281
To restore the ultimate power
to the home of my people.

352
00:24:40,881 --> 00:24:42,149
Ultimate power?

353
00:24:42,283 --> 00:24:44,618
I don't know
what you're talking about.

354
00:24:44,752 --> 00:24:45,853
You've got the wrong guy.

355
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:48,055
Ultimate power?

356
00:24:48,189 --> 00:24:51,292
Now you're speaking my language.

357
00:24:51,425 --> 00:24:54,628
Don't play dumb with me,
apprentice of Longclaw.

358
00:24:54,762 --> 00:24:56,430
You knew Longclaw?

359
00:24:56,564 --> 00:25:00,501
Longclaw and her people were the
sworn enemy of my tribe, the Echidna.

360
00:25:00,634 --> 00:25:02,770
We fought and died
at their hands,

361
00:25:02,903 --> 00:25:05,573
and now you will die at mine.

362
00:25:16,183 --> 00:25:18,452
Come on. Get in!
I'm on your side.

363
00:25:18,586 --> 00:25:20,454
I'm sorry. Who are you?

364
00:25:21,822 --> 00:25:23,424
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

365
00:25:25,926 --> 00:25:27,861
Get us out of here!
Go, go, go!

366
00:25:31,699 --> 00:25:33,067
Ah! He's gone rabid!

367
00:25:35,536 --> 00:25:37,104
Gross! Is he licking it?

368
00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:39,240
See ya!

369
00:25:39,373 --> 00:25:42,009
Make sure
to get your shots, Eggman!

370
00:25:47,181 --> 00:25:49,250
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

371
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:50,918
Whoa!

372
00:25:55,689 --> 00:25:57,091
Wow. Okay. Let me just say

373
00:25:57,224 --> 00:25:59,159
it is an honor to finally meet you,
Sonic.

374
00:25:59,293 --> 00:26:01,695
Is it okay if I call you Sonic?
Everyone calls me Tails.

375
00:26:01,829 --> 00:26:03,564
You're probably wondering why.

376
00:26:03,697 --> 00:26:07,034
Let me guess. Because of
the extra tail? That's right!

377
00:26:07,167 --> 00:26:08,869
I should've known
you'd get that. Cool.

378
00:26:09,003 --> 00:26:11,939
Also, what is going on?
Robotnik's back?

379
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:14,375
And who is Clifford
the Big Red Rage Monster?

380
00:26:14,508 --> 00:26:17,144
That's Knuckles,
the last of the Echidnas

381
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:19,480
and the most dangerous warrior
in the galaxy.

382
00:26:19,613 --> 00:26:21,815
He's obsessed with finding
the Master Emerald.

383
00:26:21,949 --> 00:26:24,151
Are you serious?
The Master Emerald?

384
00:26:24,285 --> 00:26:25,919
That's just a bedtime story.

385
00:26:26,053 --> 00:26:27,454
Well, he believes it's real.

386
00:26:27,588 --> 00:26:30,124
And he must think
you're the key to finding it.

387
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:33,861
Red light! Give me the wheel!

388
00:26:33,994 --> 00:26:36,096
Hey, what are you...
Move your foot.

389
00:26:42,704 --> 00:26:45,139
I think we lost him.

390
00:26:52,146 --> 00:26:53,847
We did not lose him.

391
00:26:53,981 --> 00:26:55,549
We definitely did not lose him!

392
00:27:00,521 --> 00:27:02,791
I've got an idea.
Do you trust me?

393
00:27:02,923 --> 00:27:05,025
Of course not!
I literally just met you!

394
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:07,361
Just let me... Come on!
What are you doing?

395
00:27:26,413 --> 00:27:27,448
We're flying.

396
00:27:27,581 --> 00:27:30,150
Uh, did your butt just
turn into a helicopter?

397
00:27:30,284 --> 00:27:32,953
A butt-copter!

398
00:27:33,087 --> 00:27:37,424
Oh, only Sonic the Hedgehog could
come up with something like that.

399
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:54,475
Foxy move.

400
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:57,678
You want something done right...

401
00:27:59,213 --> 00:28:02,316
You have to hire someone
you can push around.

402
00:28:04,418 --> 00:28:05,152
All caps.

403
00:28:15,262 --> 00:28:21,435
<i>♪ I waited till I saw the sun ♪</i>

404
00:28:21,568 --> 00:28:23,470
<i>♪ I don't know why
I didn't come ♪</i>

405
00:28:23,604 --> 00:28:25,072
Doctor,

406
00:28:25,774 --> 00:28:27,074
where are you?

407
00:28:33,715 --> 00:28:34,982
Freak.

408
00:28:42,322 --> 00:28:44,793
Oh, I, uh... I'm sorry, folks.

409
00:28:44,925 --> 00:28:47,494
Uh, I have to close early.
Everybody out!

410
00:28:47,628 --> 00:28:50,832
Everybody out. Thank you
for visiting the Mean Bean.

411
00:28:50,964 --> 00:28:53,233
All right, good night.
Good night.

412
00:29:12,152 --> 00:29:13,420
He's back.

413
00:29:14,955 --> 00:29:17,524
He's back!

414
00:30:11,779 --> 00:30:14,181
That's more like it.

415
00:30:14,949 --> 00:30:18,051
I've been re-hatched!

416
00:30:29,263 --> 00:30:33,835
So, my massively
metacarpaled friend,

417
00:30:33,968 --> 00:30:37,005
you mentioned...

418
00:30:37,137 --> 00:30:39,072
Ultimate power.

419
00:30:39,206 --> 00:30:40,206
Back at the house?

420
00:30:40,274 --> 00:30:41,910
The Master Emerald?

421
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:43,577
It does not concern you.

422
00:30:43,711 --> 00:30:46,346
I got you off that planet and
you brought me to the hedgehog.

423
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,482
We have no more use
for each other.

424
00:30:48,615 --> 00:30:50,818
Well, I hate to be
a contrarian, but...

425
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,353
I think we might.

426
00:30:54,555 --> 00:30:56,824
You think these machines
are a match for me?

427
00:30:56,958 --> 00:31:00,661
I will shatter them
like the bones from a fallen...

428
00:31:00,795 --> 00:31:02,764
Oh, they are stairs.

429
00:31:08,302 --> 00:31:12,707
You see, Earth is my turf, G.

430
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,576
If you don't know how to floss,
you'll be lost without me.

431
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:18,278
I understand nothing
of what you just said.

432
00:31:18,412 --> 00:31:23,150
I help you retrieve the Emerald,
and you use it to...

433
00:31:24,151 --> 00:31:29,189
destroy the hedgehog!

434
00:31:29,323 --> 00:31:31,425
You're suggesting an alliance.

435
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:35,897
Around here we simply
grip each other's hands tightly.

436
00:31:36,764 --> 00:31:39,533
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

437
00:31:41,168 --> 00:31:44,605
You truculent space bumpkin!

438
00:31:44,739 --> 00:31:47,008
You've crushed my favorite hand!

439
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,676
Really? My hand is uninjured.

440
00:31:49,811 --> 00:31:50,845
Ugh.

441
00:31:50,979 --> 00:31:53,047
But I'm now convinced
of your commitment.

442
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,849
"Oh, goody,"

443
00:31:54,983 --> 00:31:58,720
he exclaimed,
while he reset two of his knuckles.

444
00:31:58,853 --> 00:32:01,055
I'm...

445
00:32:01,221 --> 00:32:06,360
delighted to be
on the same team.

446
00:32:14,068 --> 00:32:15,636
Road trip!

447
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:18,605
I'll let you stick your
nose out the window.

448
00:32:19,473 --> 00:32:21,909
Uh, Sonic, where are we?

449
00:32:22,043 --> 00:32:24,277
Welcome to the Wade Cave.

450
00:32:24,411 --> 00:32:27,381
Which is something I hope
to someday say to a woman.

451
00:32:27,514 --> 00:32:29,182
A woman who's not my mom.

452
00:32:29,316 --> 00:32:31,218
Wade, focus.

453
00:32:31,351 --> 00:32:32,951
We need to figure out
why Knuckles thinks

454
00:32:32,987 --> 00:32:35,056
I'm the key to finding
the Master Emerald.

455
00:32:35,188 --> 00:32:37,457
And why did he mention Longclaw?

456
00:32:37,591 --> 00:32:39,927
There must be a connection.

457
00:32:40,061 --> 00:32:42,063
Wait a minute. There is.

458
00:32:42,195 --> 00:32:46,299
Look. There's an emerald symbol
on the map Longclaw gave me.

459
00:32:46,433 --> 00:32:48,970
I never knew
what it meant before.

460
00:32:49,103 --> 00:32:50,570
Something's happening.

461
00:32:50,705 --> 00:32:53,775
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

462
00:33:03,951 --> 00:33:05,185
Longclaw?

463
00:33:05,318 --> 00:33:06,921
Hello, Sonic.

464
00:33:07,055 --> 00:33:10,257
If you're watching this,
then something has happened to me.

465
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:13,527
And I pray you've made it
to Earth unharmed.

466
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:17,832
This world has been chosen
for a very important reason.

467
00:33:17,965 --> 00:33:22,136
It's the secret location
of the Master Emerald.

468
00:33:22,269 --> 00:33:23,738
Whoa.

469
00:33:23,871 --> 00:33:27,742
The Emerald has the power
to turn thoughts into reality.

470
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:30,610
<i>Like the Stay Puft Marshmallow
Man from Ghostbusters.</i>

471
00:33:30,745 --> 00:33:31,746
Shh!

472
00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:32,880
In the wrong hands,

473
00:33:33,014 --> 00:33:35,282
it could threaten
all life in the universe.

474
00:33:35,415 --> 00:33:38,285
Protecting the Emerald
was my sacred duty.

475
00:33:38,418 --> 00:33:42,389
And now I must pass
that responsibility to you.

476
00:33:43,256 --> 00:33:45,727
This is my moment.

477
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:49,629
Follow the map, find the Emerald,
and keep it safe.

478
00:33:50,131 --> 00:33:51,531
My dear Sonic,

479
00:33:51,665 --> 00:33:55,169
you have a heart like no
creature I've ever known.

480
00:33:55,302 --> 00:33:57,270
I love you so much.

481
00:33:58,773 --> 00:33:59,974
Goodbye.

482
00:34:01,241 --> 00:34:03,945
No, no, wait.

483
00:34:10,184 --> 00:34:12,319
I won't let you down, Longclaw.

484
00:34:14,055 --> 00:34:17,091
So is that y-your dad?

485
00:34:17,225 --> 00:34:18,726
What?

486
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,860
No?

487
00:34:19,927 --> 00:34:21,428
According to this map,

488
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:23,064
the first clue is in Siberia.

489
00:34:23,197 --> 00:34:25,565
It's a compass that
will lead to the Emerald.

490
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:28,770
And with Knuckles already here,
it's a race.

491
00:34:28,903 --> 00:34:30,370
Knuckles?

492
00:34:30,504 --> 00:34:32,272
I knew a kid in middle
school named Knuckles.

493
00:34:32,405 --> 00:34:34,208
Could fit his whole fist
in his mouth.

494
00:34:34,341 --> 00:34:36,210
If this is the same Knuckles...

495
00:34:36,343 --> 00:34:38,179
...we are screwed.

496
00:34:38,311 --> 00:34:40,982
This Knuckles,
that Knuckles. It doesn't matter.

497
00:34:41,115 --> 00:34:42,884
We're gonna get there first.

498
00:34:45,652 --> 00:34:47,387
What do you mean, "we"?

499
00:34:47,521 --> 00:34:48,890
You're coming with me.

500
00:34:49,023 --> 00:34:50,390
Oh, no, no, no.

501
00:34:50,524 --> 00:34:53,460
I just came here to warn you.
I'm not a field guy.

502
00:34:53,593 --> 00:34:55,295
Don't worry. I got your back.

503
00:34:55,428 --> 00:34:57,664
I won't let anything
happen to you.

504
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
It's a power bump.

505
00:35:00,101 --> 00:35:02,737
On Earth, it means
an unbreakable promise.

506
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:05,672
Okay, I'm in.

507
00:35:08,209 --> 00:35:12,880
<i>♪ Me and you
Maybe sunshine, maybe rain ♪</i>

508
00:35:21,222 --> 00:35:23,758
Doctor. It's really you.

509
00:35:24,457 --> 00:35:26,459
You look different.

510
00:35:26,593 --> 00:35:29,563
Papa's got a brand new 'stache.

511
00:35:30,264 --> 00:35:31,498
Ha!

512
00:35:32,432 --> 00:35:34,068
I knew it. I knew it!

513
00:35:34,202 --> 00:35:35,870
I knew you'd come back, sir.

514
00:35:36,003 --> 00:35:39,439
I never stopped steaming
your Austrian goat's milk.

515
00:35:44,477 --> 00:35:45,980
Could use some mushroom.

516
00:35:47,647 --> 00:35:48,716
You brought something.

517
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:52,686
Some kind of, uh,
space porcupine.

518
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,790
Porcupine? I am an Echidna!

519
00:35:55,923 --> 00:35:58,491
Trained since birth in
all forms of lethal combat,

520
00:35:58,625 --> 00:36:00,728
destined to restore honor
to my tribe,

521
00:36:00,862 --> 00:36:04,932
and willing to destroy
anything that gets in my way.

522
00:36:05,398 --> 00:36:06,633
Welcome to the team.

523
00:36:12,874 --> 00:36:15,375
That means he trusts you, Stone.

524
00:36:15,508 --> 00:36:18,212
Now let's renovate this dump!

525
00:36:18,346 --> 00:36:21,514
Latte with steamed
Austrian goat milk!

526
00:36:41,534 --> 00:36:42,970
Good one. Solid.

527
00:36:49,643 --> 00:36:51,112
- Sorry, fellas.
- That's game!

528
00:36:51,245 --> 00:36:54,115
Ha! That's how we do!
That's how we do!

529
00:36:54,248 --> 00:36:55,349
But are they good at math?

530
00:36:55,482 --> 00:36:57,550
Teamwork makes the dream work!

531
00:36:57,684 --> 00:36:59,486
Sorry about that, Big Tom.

532
00:36:59,619 --> 00:37:01,389
Are you good? All good. Fine.

533
00:37:01,554 --> 00:37:04,691
Thanks for inviting me out to
hang with you and your groomsmen.

534
00:37:04,825 --> 00:37:06,894
Good quality bonding.

535
00:37:07,028 --> 00:37:08,428
You know, bro,

536
00:37:08,561 --> 00:37:10,741
those guys right there,
they're way more than my groomsmen.

537
00:37:10,765 --> 00:37:12,166
That's my squad.

538
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,180
Never would've made it
through life without 'em.

539
00:37:14,268 --> 00:37:15,369
Get over here!

540
00:37:15,502 --> 00:37:17,071
Yeah, I'm coming! I'm coming!

541
00:37:17,204 --> 00:37:18,406
I'll catch you later.

542
00:37:18,538 --> 00:37:20,107
Hey. Yeah!

543
00:37:20,241 --> 00:37:22,609
Let me know if you're ready
for some power yoga, huh?

544
00:37:22,743 --> 00:37:25,713
You bet. Come on,
Tommy boy. Let's go.

545
00:37:25,846 --> 00:37:28,015
Don't make me.

546
00:37:28,149 --> 00:37:29,150
What am I doing?

547
00:37:29,283 --> 00:37:30,450
Hey, Uncle Tommy!

548
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:32,119
Hey, girls!

549
00:37:32,253 --> 00:37:33,387
How you do... Oh!

550
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,056
Are those the
wedding rings? Uh-huh.

551
00:37:35,189 --> 00:37:36,791
May I?

552
00:37:36,924 --> 00:37:39,559
This little ring bearer has been
taking her job very seriously.

553
00:37:39,693 --> 00:37:41,262
She's been practicing
all morning.

554
00:37:41,395 --> 00:37:42,495
I can see that.

555
00:37:42,629 --> 00:37:44,865
How very responsible of you.

556
00:37:44,999 --> 00:37:47,301
Except aren't there supposed
to be two wedding rings?

557
00:37:47,435 --> 00:37:49,337
Uh-oh.

558
00:37:49,469 --> 00:37:50,503
Uncle Tommy?

559
00:37:50,637 --> 00:37:53,506
Hang on. What's going on here?

560
00:37:55,608 --> 00:37:56,911
You're gonna do great, kiddo.

561
00:37:57,044 --> 00:37:58,044
Bye.

562
00:37:58,145 --> 00:37:59,646
Hey, baby. Hi.

563
00:38:01,983 --> 00:38:04,484
That's right!
Groom in the building!

564
00:38:04,617 --> 00:38:06,120
Look at those guys.

565
00:38:06,253 --> 00:38:08,521
I wish Sonic had that.

566
00:38:08,655 --> 00:38:10,791
Muscles? Control yourself.

567
00:38:10,925 --> 00:38:11,726
Mm-hmm.

568
00:38:11,859 --> 00:38:15,296
No. Buddies. Wingmen. A squad.

569
00:38:15,429 --> 00:38:19,266
Sonic doesn't have anything
like that. He's flying solo.

570
00:38:19,934 --> 00:38:21,836
Baby, you got to relax.

571
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:24,071
You're at the Four Seasons.

572
00:38:24,205 --> 00:38:27,074
Have a Mai Tai. Spend
some time with your wife.

573
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:30,411
That's what he said.
Seriously, his exact words.

574
00:38:30,543 --> 00:38:32,545
See? He's a
smart kid. All right.

575
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:34,315
Hmm. He'll find his way.

576
00:38:34,448 --> 00:38:38,052
I absolutely cannot find
my way.

577
00:38:38,185 --> 00:38:41,621
We are completely, totally,
unequivocally lost.

578
00:38:43,224 --> 00:38:44,591
Sonic, in this weather,

579
00:38:44,725 --> 00:38:47,428
there's no way we're gonna get
any readings on this thing!

580
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,729
Should we go back?

581
00:38:48,863 --> 00:38:50,697
No, no, no.
There's a light up ahead.

582
00:38:50,831 --> 00:38:53,034
Maybe we can take shelter
in there.

583
00:38:56,704 --> 00:38:59,240
Ah. Perfect.

584
00:38:59,373 --> 00:39:02,443
Are you sure about this?
We don't know who's inside.

585
00:39:02,575 --> 00:39:05,913
Don't worry. On Earth,
people are very welcoming,

586
00:39:06,047 --> 00:39:09,417
and love taking complete
strangers into their homes.

587
00:39:39,646 --> 00:39:40,915
Run.

588
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:45,086
Table for two, please!

589
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:50,891
Two beef stews, please.

590
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:58,132
Where'd you get
all these cool gadgets?

591
00:39:58,265 --> 00:39:59,567
I invented 'em.

592
00:39:59,699 --> 00:40:01,601
That's kinda my thing.

593
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:04,839
In fact, my inventions
are how I discovered you.

594
00:40:04,972 --> 00:40:07,174
<i>Remember that night
at the baseball field?</i>

595
00:40:07,308 --> 00:40:11,011
<i>Your energy blast reached
all the way to my home planet.</i>

596
00:40:11,145 --> 00:40:15,783
I saw you save your whole village
from that crazy mustache guy.

597
00:40:15,916 --> 00:40:19,220
Wait, so you've been
watching me this whole time?

598
00:40:19,353 --> 00:40:20,754
Even in the shower?

599
00:40:20,888 --> 00:40:22,790
That's a trick question.

600
00:40:22,923 --> 00:40:25,192
Sonic the Hedgehog
prefers bubble baths.

601
00:40:25,326 --> 00:40:26,527
Man, you're good!

602
00:40:26,659 --> 00:40:28,963
When I learned Knuckles
was on your trail,

603
00:40:29,096 --> 00:40:31,899
I knew I couldn't just sit
back and watch anymore.

604
00:40:32,032 --> 00:40:33,534
I had to come warn you.

605
00:40:34,802 --> 00:40:36,470
Oh, what? Hang on one sec.

606
00:40:36,604 --> 00:40:38,305
Donut Lord is checking in.

607
00:40:39,707 --> 00:40:44,245
"Just chilling. Watching TV."

608
00:40:44,378 --> 00:40:46,614
Dot, dot, dot.

609
00:40:46,747 --> 00:40:49,517
Dot, dot, dot.

610
00:40:49,649 --> 00:40:51,352
Dot, dot, dot.

611
00:40:51,485 --> 00:40:53,653
Dot, dot, dot.

612
00:40:53,787 --> 00:40:56,924
Dot, dot, dot.

613
00:40:57,057 --> 00:40:58,726
Doctor,

614
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:02,263
why are we working
with this imbecile?

615
00:41:02,396 --> 00:41:07,868
Because that simpleminded space trash
is the key to something extraordinary.

616
00:41:08,002 --> 00:41:10,905
Something to help you
get revenge on the hedgehog.

617
00:41:11,038 --> 00:41:12,740
Think bigger, Stone.

618
00:41:12,873 --> 00:41:16,043
The emerald he seeks
could power my wildest designs.

619
00:41:16,177 --> 00:41:18,412
My genius wouldn't
just be recognized on Earth.

620
00:41:18,546 --> 00:41:21,482
It would spread virally
to every corner of the galaxy,

621
00:41:21,615 --> 00:41:25,719
allowing me to harness all the
negative forces of the universe

622
00:41:25,853 --> 00:41:27,988
and commune
with Darkness itself.

623
00:41:28,122 --> 00:41:30,824
Wow. That sounds big.

624
00:41:30,958 --> 00:41:34,228
It's been on my vision board for
years. It's the Law of Attraction.

625
00:41:34,361 --> 00:41:37,164
<i>Didn't you see The Secret?</i>

626
00:41:37,298 --> 00:41:39,266
Kaplooey!

627
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,201
Kaplooey.

628
00:41:40,334 --> 00:41:43,604
"Another boring night at home."

629
00:41:43,737 --> 00:41:45,673
The hedgehog has returned home!

630
00:41:45,806 --> 00:41:48,909
<i>Falsa.
Which is Latin for "wrong-o."</i>

631
00:41:49,043 --> 00:41:54,748
According to my worldwide network
cell tower triangulation, he's lying,

632
00:41:54,882 --> 00:41:56,884
all the way

633
00:41:57,017 --> 00:42:01,689
from the majestic hinterlands
of Eastern Siberia.

634
00:42:01,822 --> 00:42:05,226
He's a long-distance liar!

635
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:09,363
Kuh! Kuh! Kuh!
Nga-nga-nga-nga-nga!

636
00:42:09,496 --> 00:42:11,832
Yeah, there's more
where that came from.

637
00:42:14,168 --> 00:42:16,470
Tiny magic hedgehog destroyed.

638
00:42:17,738 --> 00:42:20,007
Now let's begin our quest.

639
00:42:22,676 --> 00:42:23,811
Wait.

640
00:42:23,944 --> 00:42:26,814
What about your Minion?
The goat milker.

641
00:42:26,947 --> 00:42:29,149
There's no room
on the ship for Stone.

642
00:42:29,283 --> 00:42:32,219
I say we ditch him,
ghost him, blow him off.

643
00:42:32,353 --> 00:42:33,387
Dishonor!

644
00:42:34,688 --> 00:42:37,391
"Dis" is how I roll.

645
00:42:43,464 --> 00:42:45,065
Ugh!

646
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:48,469
Uh, I'm sorry,
but I asked for the beef stew.

647
00:42:54,675 --> 00:42:55,876
Uh...

648
00:42:58,479 --> 00:43:00,047
Uh, what's going on?

649
00:43:00,814 --> 00:43:03,183
Maybe they think
it's my birthday?

650
00:43:04,118 --> 00:43:05,819
Don't worry,
I'll take care of this.

651
00:43:05,953 --> 00:43:07,655
Okay, everybody, take it easy.

652
00:43:07,788 --> 00:43:09,790
I'm sure there's
a perfectly good explanation

653
00:43:09,923 --> 00:43:13,360
for whatever my friend said
or did.

654
00:43:20,034 --> 00:43:21,969
Uh... meow?

655
00:43:28,242 --> 00:43:29,410
Oh, no, no. Come on, guys.

656
00:43:29,543 --> 00:43:31,478
Take it easy.
Let's talk this through.

657
00:43:31,612 --> 00:43:33,280
Let's talk this through!

658
00:43:34,882 --> 00:43:37,017
Come on, come on.
Scanning Siberian customs.

659
00:43:37,151 --> 00:43:38,585
There's got to be
something in here.

660
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,888
Tails,
whatever you're doing, do it fast.

661
00:43:41,021 --> 00:43:42,021
Ooh! I think I got it!

662
00:43:42,122 --> 00:43:44,425
<i>Pivonka! Pivonka!</i>

663
00:43:44,558 --> 00:43:46,894
<i>Pivonka!</i>

664
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:51,733
<i>Oh? Pivonka?</i>

665
00:43:51,865 --> 00:43:54,902
<i>Pivonka.</i>

666
00:44:14,388 --> 00:44:15,689
<i>Da.</i>

667
00:44:15,824 --> 00:44:16,825
<i>Pivonka!</i>

668
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:20,594
<i>Tails, what's a "pivonka"?</i>

669
00:44:20,729 --> 00:44:23,497
It's a Siberian custom
to resolve disputes.

670
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:26,500
If we win, they let us go.
If we lose...

671
00:44:32,473 --> 00:44:35,175
Okay, we have to grab the map
and get out of here. Where's the map?

672
00:44:35,309 --> 00:44:38,278
Oh, no. I left it
on the table! Look!

673
00:44:45,486 --> 00:44:47,254
What?

674
00:45:10,144 --> 00:45:13,147
Oh, my God, it's a dance fight.

675
00:45:14,248 --> 00:45:16,550
Sonic, what do we do?

676
00:45:16,683 --> 00:45:19,153
We dance and get that map.

677
00:45:20,755 --> 00:45:21,823
Here we go.

678
00:45:21,955 --> 00:45:23,624
Ow!

679
00:45:25,392 --> 00:45:27,661
Okay, now let's do... No,
we're gonna go...

680
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,135
Ah, okay.

681
00:45:43,878 --> 00:45:45,312
Okay, this is not going well.

682
00:45:45,446 --> 00:45:47,849
Channing Tatum
makes it look so easy.

683
00:45:47,981 --> 00:45:49,650
Wait, Sonic. Look!

684
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:54,354
<i>Opa! Opa! Opa!</i>

685
00:45:54,488 --> 00:45:56,490
The map! Come on, let's grab it!

686
00:46:00,461 --> 00:46:01,495
You want?

687
00:46:02,095 --> 00:46:03,731
Come get.

688
00:46:03,865 --> 00:46:05,867
Freaks!

689
00:46:05,999 --> 00:46:07,100
Freaks!

690
00:46:07,234 --> 00:46:09,670
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!

691
00:46:09,804 --> 00:46:11,873
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!

692
00:46:12,005 --> 00:46:14,041
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!

693
00:46:14,174 --> 00:46:15,609
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!

694
00:46:15,743 --> 00:46:18,278
What's wrong,
Tails? Come on. I need you!

695
00:46:18,412 --> 00:46:21,281
I can't do this, Sonic.
I'm not brave like you.

696
00:46:21,415 --> 00:46:24,084
My gadget got us in this mess,
and I lost your map,

697
00:46:24,218 --> 00:46:26,487
and we're gonna get
tossed into a fire!

698
00:46:29,389 --> 00:46:30,491
Ah...

699
00:46:31,191 --> 00:46:32,927
New deejay coming in.

700
00:46:36,563 --> 00:46:38,098
Come on, pal. I got an idea.

701
00:46:38,232 --> 00:46:39,566
They called us freaks,

702
00:46:41,001 --> 00:46:42,536
so let's get freaky.

703
00:46:42,669 --> 00:46:45,305
Just follow my moves.
You'll be fine.

00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:14,428
Whoo-hoo! We did it!

734
00:48:14,561 --> 00:48:18,131
That was amazing!
Way to go, Tails.

735
00:48:26,139 --> 00:48:27,641
Wow.

736
00:48:27,775 --> 00:48:31,079
Only Sonic the Hedgehog
could win a dance battle that epic.

737
00:48:31,211 --> 00:48:32,512
Well, stick with me, pal.

738
00:48:32,646 --> 00:48:34,181
Earth can be a scary place,

739
00:48:34,314 --> 00:48:36,751
but I know everything
about this old pale blue dot.

740
00:48:36,884 --> 00:48:38,552
Do you really mean that?

741
00:48:38,685 --> 00:48:42,122
I mean, not everything. But I watch
a lot of Discovery Channel and...

742
00:48:42,255 --> 00:48:45,392
I meant about me being your pal.

743
00:48:46,861 --> 00:48:48,428
Of course, buddy.

744
00:48:50,197 --> 00:48:53,200
Comin' in hot.

745
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:55,837
Growing up,
I didn't have any friends.

746
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:59,040
Everyone in my village
thought my two tails were weird.

747
00:48:59,172 --> 00:49:00,708
Hey, I know that feeling.

748
00:49:00,842 --> 00:49:04,812
But then I saw you,
the fastest creature in the galaxy.

749
00:49:04,946 --> 00:49:09,117
You were weird too.
But you were a legend.

750
00:49:09,249 --> 00:49:13,220
That made me think,
maybe being weird isn't so bad.

751
00:49:13,353 --> 00:49:16,256
You inspired me
to leave my village,

752
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:19,259
to find you and help you
in your mission.

753
00:49:19,393 --> 00:49:21,561
I'm really glad
you're here, Tails.

754
00:49:21,695 --> 00:49:24,231
I'm glad I'm here too, Sonic.

755
00:49:29,603 --> 00:49:32,472
Well, might as well
get some sleep.

756
00:49:32,606 --> 00:49:34,909
This feels like a good
place to spend the night.

757
00:49:35,043 --> 00:49:37,220
You'll be able to get clear
readings on your gizmo thing

758
00:49:37,244 --> 00:49:39,646
once the storm is over,
so I...

759
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:52,827
Night, Tails.

760
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:09,877
Tails. Tails. We have
a situation.

761
00:50:15,083 --> 00:50:16,383
Hoo-hoo!

762
00:50:16,516 --> 00:50:19,319
Today's forecast calls for
clear, sunny skies

763
00:50:19,453 --> 00:50:22,123
and a 100% chance of
adventure.

764
00:50:22,255 --> 00:50:25,659
I pinpointed the coordinates.
It's right up ahead.

765
00:50:28,096 --> 00:50:29,496
Wow.

766
00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:41,008
Hey, Tails. Wait up.

767
00:50:42,676 --> 00:50:43,945
Whoa.

768
00:50:46,513 --> 00:50:50,852
Okay,
we got a giant owl door. Seems encouraging.

769
00:51:01,361 --> 00:51:02,662
Whoa.

770
00:51:04,065 --> 00:51:05,099
Check this out.

771
00:51:05,233 --> 00:51:06,566
Can you translate that?

772
00:51:06,701 --> 00:51:08,035
Uh, yeah.

773
00:51:09,237 --> 00:51:12,405
<i>Ages ago,
a fearsome group of warriors,</i>

774
00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:14,175
<i>known as the Echidnas,</i>

775
00:51:14,307 --> 00:51:16,276
<i>forged the Seven Chaos Emeralds</i>

776
00:51:16,409 --> 00:51:20,647
<i>into the most unstoppable
weapon ever created.</i>

777
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:25,285
The Master Emerald.

778
00:51:25,418 --> 00:51:27,654
<i>With it, a single warrior</i>

779
00:51:27,789 --> 00:51:30,357
<i>could defeat entire armies.</i>

780
00:51:32,827 --> 00:51:35,730
<i>Believing no one should
have such power,</i>

781
00:51:35,863 --> 00:51:38,766
<i>an order of heroes
recovered the Emerald</i>

782
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,936
<i>and swore to protect it
from evil.</i>

783
00:51:42,737 --> 00:51:44,538
Sounds like
the Owls and the Echidnas

784
00:51:44,671 --> 00:51:47,175
have been fighting
each other for centuries.

785
00:51:47,307 --> 00:51:49,509
Like Vin Diesel and The Rock.

786
00:51:50,278 --> 00:51:52,379
Whoa! Wait for me.

787
00:51:58,552 --> 00:52:02,990
Okay, giant owl door,
giant owl. Makes sense.

788
00:52:03,724 --> 00:52:05,525
Whoa.

789
00:52:14,235 --> 00:52:17,437
Wait a second.
I've seen these symbols before.

790
00:52:21,275 --> 00:52:22,743
Here we go.

791
00:52:31,219 --> 00:52:32,854
Well, that did something.

792
00:52:49,669 --> 00:52:51,305
Whoa! The compass!

793
00:52:51,438 --> 00:52:53,506
This will lead us
to the Emerald!

794
00:52:58,913 --> 00:53:01,481
Hey, you got
a little something on your...

795
00:53:01,615 --> 00:53:04,551
Oh, no. Tails, get back.

796
00:53:09,023 --> 00:53:10,858
Run!

797
00:53:17,131 --> 00:53:18,165
That guy again?

798
00:53:18,299 --> 00:53:20,334
Heads up, my little stalagmites.

799
00:53:20,467 --> 00:53:21,869
Someone call an Uber?

800
00:53:22,003 --> 00:53:25,438
Hey, thanks for doing
all the hard stuff.

801
00:53:28,776 --> 00:53:30,811
But we'll take it from here.

802
00:53:30,945 --> 00:53:33,480
Okay, we really gotta talk
about your new look.

803
00:53:33,613 --> 00:53:36,150
It's like Professor X
meets the Monopoly man.

804
00:53:36,284 --> 00:53:39,754
And what kind of genius shows
up to Siberia in a convertible?

805
00:53:39,887 --> 00:53:43,124
The kind of genius
that can turn up the heat...

806
00:53:44,892 --> 00:53:46,861
with a flick of a switch.

807
00:53:54,534 --> 00:53:57,371
Oh! Whoo!

808
00:53:58,239 --> 00:54:01,042
Good one!
I'm sure that wasn't important.

809
00:54:03,377 --> 00:54:05,780
Tails, that's our exit. Come on.

810
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:20,560
Uh-huh. Let's split up.

811
00:54:20,694 --> 00:54:22,263
You go high, I go low.

812
00:54:22,396 --> 00:54:23,463
Right.

813
00:54:23,596 --> 00:54:25,967
Quick little stretch
and here we go.

814
00:54:37,411 --> 00:54:39,013
Oh, so you want to play?

815
00:54:44,051 --> 00:54:45,552
That's new.

816
00:54:45,685 --> 00:54:47,922
Whoa.

817
00:54:56,964 --> 00:54:58,232
Sonic!

818
00:55:11,312 --> 00:55:12,913
Snowball fight!

819
00:55:18,085 --> 00:55:22,323
It's too easy.
Come on, challenge me!

820
00:55:31,165 --> 00:55:35,936
<i>♪ There's a summer place ♪</i>

821
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:38,973
We are talking style
and pizzazz.

822
00:55:39,106 --> 00:55:41,876
<i>♪ Where it may rain or storm ♪</i>

823
00:55:42,009 --> 00:55:43,878
Pew-pew-pew!
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

824
00:55:44,011 --> 00:55:45,746
<i>♪ Yet I'm safe and warm ♪</i>

825
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:49,250
Yeah! I make this look good.

826
00:55:51,584 --> 00:55:53,954
Oh, great. The Winter Soldier.

827
00:56:00,461 --> 00:56:03,297
For a guy named Knuckles,
you are really bad at punching.

828
00:56:03,431 --> 00:56:06,801
Surrender the compass!
You are no match for me.

829
00:56:06,934 --> 00:56:09,336
I've been training for this
my entire life.

830
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:12,940
And I had no training at all,
yet here I am ahead of you.

831
00:56:13,074 --> 00:56:15,575
That's gotta be embarrassing.

832
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:22,883
My rings!

833
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,723
Has anyone ever told you
you've got serious anger issues?

834
00:56:29,857 --> 00:56:31,892
You mock me
with your weak jokes,

835
00:56:32,026 --> 00:56:33,928
but you know nothing
about me, hedgehog.

836
00:56:34,061 --> 00:56:38,399
Well, I know you Echidnas have a habit of
showing up uninvited and ruining my life.

837
00:56:38,532 --> 00:56:41,802
Ruining your life?
Another bad joke.

838
00:56:41,936 --> 00:56:44,538
I lost everything
because of you.

839
00:56:44,671 --> 00:56:48,042
<i>My tribe was on the verge
of its greatest victory.</i>

840
00:56:48,175 --> 00:56:51,011
<i>The last of the Owl warriors
had been located.</i>

841
00:56:51,145 --> 00:56:54,882
<i>Soon Longclaw's Emerald secrets
would be ours.</i>

842
00:56:55,015 --> 00:56:58,119
<i>But my father stopped me
from joining the fight.</i>

843
00:56:58,252 --> 00:57:01,822
<i>He said my moment
to honor our tribe would come,</i>

844
00:57:01,956 --> 00:57:03,991
<i>but it was not this moment.</i>

845
00:57:04,125 --> 00:57:06,760
<i>Those were the last words
he spoke to me.</i>

846
00:57:06,894 --> 00:57:09,396
I never saw him again.

847
00:57:10,831 --> 00:57:13,666
We both lost everything
that day.

848
00:57:15,769 --> 00:57:17,338
Goodbye, Sonic. No!

849
00:57:17,471 --> 00:57:19,406
<i>Longclaw!</i>

850
00:57:23,611 --> 00:57:25,446
Sonic! Are you okay?

851
00:57:25,579 --> 00:57:27,281
Deceiver!

852
00:57:27,414 --> 00:57:29,817
No, it wasn't a trick.

853
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:33,020
Tails, take the compass
and get out of here!

854
00:57:36,157 --> 00:57:37,191
Yeah!

855
00:57:38,459 --> 00:57:40,427
Later, haters!

856
00:57:43,663 --> 00:57:44,999
Tails!

857
00:57:51,906 --> 00:57:53,307
Tails, come on. Wake up.

858
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,310
He chose helping the fox
over pursuing the compass.

859
00:57:56,443 --> 00:57:57,778
Of course he did.

860
00:57:57,912 --> 00:58:00,514
New friend,
same pathetic weakness.

861
00:58:00,648 --> 00:58:03,050
Hmm.

862
00:58:10,624 --> 00:58:13,294
Oh, no. No, no, no.
We're in real trouble here.

863
00:58:13,427 --> 00:58:16,864
Come on, Tails. I need you to fly
us out of here. Time to wake up.

864
00:58:24,171 --> 00:58:27,708
See ya, kids.
Enjoy the fresh powder.

865
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,201
Did you...

866
00:58:59,573 --> 00:59:02,243
These rings signify the...

867
00:59:07,982 --> 00:59:09,650
Sorry.

868
00:59:09,783 --> 00:59:11,452
Thought it was on silent.

869
00:59:17,925 --> 00:59:20,361
These rings...

870
00:59:21,428 --> 00:59:22,896
So help me, Thomas!

871
00:59:27,534 --> 00:59:28,836
Okay, sorry. Sorry.

872
00:59:28,969 --> 00:59:30,838
Excuse me, this is an emergency.

873
00:59:32,406 --> 00:59:34,074
Sorry.

874
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:41,515
What? This better
be important. I just...

875
00:59:41,649 --> 00:59:43,083
<i>Are you skiing?</i>

876
00:59:43,217 --> 00:59:45,152
<i>Snowboarding, actually.
But I need your help now.</i>

877
00:59:45,286 --> 00:59:47,488
Life or death situation
this very second.

878
00:59:47,621 --> 00:59:50,491
I need you to use the ring I gave
you to save me. Like right now.

879
00:59:50,624 --> 00:59:52,960
<i>Okay,
slow down. I don't even know where you are.</i>

880
00:59:53,093 --> 00:59:55,396
You just gotta picture
where you want the ring to go.

881
00:59:55,529 --> 00:59:56,864
So picture this.

882
00:59:59,266 --> 01:00:02,136
Oh, my God. Okay, okay. Hang on.

883
01:00:09,877 --> 01:00:11,512
What?

884
01:00:13,013 --> 01:00:14,982
<i>Did you throw it?</i>

885
01:00:15,115 --> 01:00:17,418
<i>Oh, God. What? Tell me what "Oh,
God."</i>

886
01:00:17,551 --> 01:00:19,229
I mixed up the rings
when I was teasing Jojo.

887
01:00:19,253 --> 01:00:21,021
<i>What? Where is it then?</i>

888
01:00:25,225 --> 01:00:26,393
You don't want to know.

889
01:00:26,527 --> 01:00:27,729
<i>But I do, Tom.</i>

890
01:00:27,861 --> 01:00:29,141
<i>I very much want to know,</i>

891
01:00:29,229 --> 01:00:31,699
before I become
a hedgehog-flavored snow cone.

892
01:00:31,832 --> 01:00:33,834
Hang tight, buddy. I got this.

893
01:00:33,967 --> 01:00:35,737
With this ring, Rachel...

894
01:00:35,869 --> 01:00:37,604
Hey! Hi.

895
01:00:37,739 --> 01:00:39,606
Uh... Everything okay, bud?

896
01:00:39,741 --> 01:00:41,408
Not really. What are you doing?

897
01:00:41,542 --> 01:00:43,844
This is gonna sound crazy,
but I need to see that ring

898
01:00:43,977 --> 01:00:46,180
for just one second.
Have you lost your mind?

899
01:00:46,313 --> 01:00:47,948
I'm gonna give it
right back, I promise.

900
01:00:48,082 --> 01:00:50,752
Please, Randall, it's really important. No,
bro. Go sit down.

901
01:00:50,884 --> 01:00:53,987
Give me the ring, please? Randall,
don't look at him, look at me.

902
01:00:54,121 --> 01:00:55,724
One second.
Put the ring on my finger.

903
01:00:55,856 --> 01:00:57,224
No, Randall, listen to me.

904
01:00:57,358 --> 01:00:59,059
Randall! Look at me.
Ring on my finger.

905
01:00:59,193 --> 01:01:01,962
Give me the ring! Just
one second. Put a ring on it!

906
01:01:02,563 --> 01:01:03,798
Please, love? Okay?

907
01:01:03,931 --> 01:01:04,974
With this ring... Yes, baby.

908
01:01:04,998 --> 01:01:06,735
I'm so sorry about this.

909
01:01:16,944 --> 01:01:19,279
Snow, my God. Oh, boy.

910
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:21,348
Incoming!

911
01:01:25,854 --> 01:01:27,421
Oh.

912
01:01:32,861 --> 01:01:34,328
Anybody hurt?

913
01:01:34,461 --> 01:01:36,430
Sonic! Hawaii.

914
01:01:36,563 --> 01:01:37,664
Are you okay?

915
01:01:37,799 --> 01:01:39,666
What's happening?
Are you hurt?

916
01:01:39,801 --> 01:01:41,502
No, no, I'm fine. Okay, good.

917
01:01:41,635 --> 01:01:43,137
Because you're in
so much trouble!

918
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:45,406
Okay, you calm down.

919
01:01:45,539 --> 01:01:46,741
You talk.

920
01:01:46,875 --> 01:01:48,375
Okay, quick version.

921
01:01:48,509 --> 01:01:50,779
Robotnik is back on Earth
and he's after a magic emerald.

922
01:01:52,279 --> 01:01:55,416
We need to get it back
or the world is doomed.

923
01:01:55,949 --> 01:01:57,084
Tails!

924
01:01:57,217 --> 01:01:59,219
Wait! All this happened
since yesterday?

925
01:01:59,353 --> 01:02:00,621
Wait. Who's Tails?

926
01:02:00,755 --> 01:02:01,890
Tails, can you hear me?

927
01:02:02,022 --> 01:02:03,924
Oh, Lord,
there are two of them now.

928
01:02:04,057 --> 01:02:06,326
Okay, let me think.
Tails, come on, buddy.

929
01:02:10,998 --> 01:02:12,332
Hey!

930
01:02:12,466 --> 01:02:14,935
Randall,
why do all of your friends have weapons?

931
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:20,207
You really should have taken me up
on that brunch, Mr. and Mrs. Wachowski.

932
01:02:20,708 --> 01:02:22,042
Olive Garden guy?

933
01:02:22,176 --> 01:02:24,945
It's okay, everyone.
We're federal agents.

934
01:02:25,078 --> 01:02:27,981
You, too, Agent. Go ahead.

935
01:02:34,154 --> 01:02:35,656
You mean to tell me

936
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:38,927
that this entire wedding was a
setup? Rachel, wait a minute.

937
01:02:39,059 --> 01:02:40,059
What?

938
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:41,261
That's correct, ma'am.

939
01:02:41,395 --> 01:02:43,030
Every single aspect
of Operation Catfish

940
01:02:43,163 --> 01:02:44,998
was a complete fabrication.

941
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:47,167
Operation Catfish?

942
01:02:47,301 --> 01:02:50,037
So is everyone here an agent?

943
01:02:51,104 --> 01:02:52,473
Are you an agent?

944
01:02:53,106 --> 01:02:54,508
Son of a...

945
01:02:54,641 --> 01:02:58,045
Was the florist an agent?
How about the photographer?

946
01:02:58,178 --> 01:03:00,447
The woman who waxed my...

947
01:03:01,215 --> 01:03:02,516
at the spa?

948
01:03:03,984 --> 01:03:04,984
Is Jojo an agent?

949
01:03:05,085 --> 01:03:06,420
Rachel.

950
01:03:06,553 --> 01:03:07,856
What?

951
01:03:07,988 --> 01:03:08,988
Rachel, listen to me.

952
01:03:09,089 --> 01:03:10,224
I'm done listening!

953
01:03:10,357 --> 01:03:12,459
I am done listening!

954
01:03:12,593 --> 01:03:15,730
I am so sorry. I am
so sorry.

955
01:03:15,864 --> 01:03:17,564
I really am. I am so sorry.

956
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,468
No. Hey, no!

957
01:03:21,602 --> 01:03:24,238
Let him go! Hey!

958
01:03:27,775 --> 01:03:29,276
Sonic, hang on.

959
01:03:29,409 --> 01:03:30,879
Take it easy. It's not worth it.

960
01:03:31,011 --> 01:03:32,513
Tom! Ah-ah-ah.

961
01:03:32,646 --> 01:03:35,249
Sonic is not a threat.
He's on our side.

962
01:03:35,382 --> 01:03:37,251
He's an uncontrolled
extraterrestrial.

963
01:03:37,384 --> 01:03:39,386
And your days of aiding
and abetting him are over.

964
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:42,222
Secure them in the hotel
until the chopper arrives.

965
01:03:42,356 --> 01:03:44,224
You're making a mistake.

966
01:03:44,358 --> 01:03:46,560
Hold on, Major A-hole!

967
01:03:46,693 --> 01:03:48,128
This is still my day,

968
01:03:48,262 --> 01:03:51,966
and someone is gonna explain to
me what the hell is going on here!

969
01:03:52,099 --> 01:03:53,419
After the events
in San Francisco,

970
01:03:53,534 --> 01:03:55,302
a global task force was created,

971
01:03:55,435 --> 01:03:58,539
devoted to protecting
our planet from alien threats.

972
01:03:58,672 --> 01:04:01,341
That day,
Guardian Units of Nations was born.

973
01:04:01,475 --> 01:04:03,878
G-U-N. Seriously? GUN, yeah.

974
01:04:04,012 --> 01:04:07,114
Look, what about protecting
our planet from Dr. Robotnik?

975
01:04:08,148 --> 01:04:09,383
Robotnik is dead.

976
01:04:09,516 --> 01:04:11,518
You're wrong. He's back.

977
01:04:11,652 --> 01:04:14,421
And you just hauled away the
only ones who could stop him.

978
01:04:16,824 --> 01:04:18,927
Sounds like Robotnik
might be back in play.

979
01:04:19,059 --> 01:04:21,695
If he is,
I want him found immediately.

980
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:25,332
And cancel my five o'clock
at the Olive Garden.

981
01:04:25,465 --> 01:04:27,100
Aunt Maddie? Yeah.

982
01:04:27,234 --> 01:04:29,202
Sonic and his friend
dropped this.

983
01:04:35,843 --> 01:04:37,110
I have an idea.

984
01:04:37,244 --> 01:04:39,313
And I want to have
a word with my fiancé.

985
01:04:39,446 --> 01:04:41,381
And that word is "murder."

986
01:04:45,686 --> 01:04:48,488
Hey, come on.
You can't just leave us in here.

987
01:04:48,622 --> 01:04:52,159
My friend is hurt! He needs a doctor,
a vet, anyone!

988
01:04:53,193 --> 01:04:54,695
Tails,
you got to wake up, buddy.

989
01:04:54,829 --> 01:04:56,463
Please wake up.

990
01:05:03,838 --> 01:05:05,707
All clear.

991
01:05:09,176 --> 01:05:10,878
All right. Game plan.

992
01:05:11,012 --> 01:05:13,652
I get inside the hotel and find
where they're hiding Tom and Sonic.

993
01:05:13,748 --> 01:05:15,382
Okay.
Then I find Randall, right?

994
01:05:15,515 --> 01:05:16,851
And then I squeeze the breath

995
01:05:16,985 --> 01:05:21,121
from his lying, deceitful,
perfectly manscaped body!

996
01:05:23,490 --> 01:05:25,225
I'm going through
a lot right now.

997
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:27,028
So let me process this
my own way, okay?

998
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:28,428
Sure, sure.

999
01:05:28,562 --> 01:05:30,765
No judgment. Should've
brought a journal.

1000
01:05:30,898 --> 01:05:32,332
Okay...

1001
01:05:32,466 --> 01:05:35,837
Okay. Is this meant to be a
weapon? This is adorable.

1002
01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:38,006
Pew, pew! Take that, Randall!

1003
01:05:38,138 --> 01:05:40,108
Run, Randall!

1004
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,508
All right.

1005
01:05:41,642 --> 01:05:43,510
We're about to
find out. All right!

1006
01:05:43,644 --> 01:05:46,246
Let's go kick some Booty.

1007
01:05:48,181 --> 01:05:49,851
Shh! Shh!

1008
01:05:59,093 --> 01:06:00,694
Rachel! No. Rachel!

1009
01:06:01,896 --> 01:06:03,196
In a minute.

1010
01:06:04,065 --> 01:06:05,632
Mm-mmm! Mm.

1011
01:06:08,736 --> 01:06:10,138
Stop right there!

1012
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:11,672
Get the bag.

1013
01:06:19,613 --> 01:06:21,181
He's gonna
come back down, right?

1014
01:06:21,314 --> 01:06:22,817
I don't know.

1015
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:24,184
Good luck!

1016
01:06:25,887 --> 01:06:28,288
Look. Tom and Sonic
have to be inside.

1017
01:06:28,422 --> 01:06:30,892
I got a fiancé to
vaporize. Uh-huh.

1018
01:06:31,025 --> 01:06:32,392
Watch your back, sis. Okay.

1019
01:06:35,328 --> 01:06:36,563
Randall!

1020
01:06:43,403 --> 01:06:44,571
We got her.

1021
01:06:44,706 --> 01:06:46,306
Move in.

1022
01:06:49,911 --> 01:06:50,945
Okay.

1023
01:07:07,161 --> 01:07:09,329
I did not mean to do that!

1024
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:13,300
Whoo!

1025
01:07:21,675 --> 01:07:23,610
Something bothering you, Agent?

1026
01:07:23,745 --> 01:07:26,214
I just feel a little guilty
about what I did to Rachel, sir.

1027
01:07:26,346 --> 01:07:29,917
Ah, don't worry about it.
We'll send her a gift card.

1028
01:07:30,051 --> 01:07:32,385
Now, I propose a toast.

1029
01:07:35,322 --> 01:07:38,092
To a perfectly
executed operation.

1030
01:07:42,696 --> 01:07:44,364
Sir, we're under attack.

1031
01:08:04,719 --> 01:08:09,356
Randall, wifey's home!

1032
01:08:13,094 --> 01:08:14,829
Oh, my God. Rachel.

1033
01:08:16,663 --> 01:08:19,000
<i>♪ You lying so low
In the weeds ♪</i>

1034
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:23,104
<i>♪ I bet you gonna ambush me ♪</i>

1035
01:08:23,237 --> 01:08:28,810
<i>♪ You'd have me down, down
Down, down on my knees ♪</i>

1036
01:08:28,943 --> 01:08:31,611
<i>♪ Now wouldn't you, barracuda? ♪</i>

1037
01:08:34,048 --> 01:08:35,883
<i>♪ Oh ♪</i>

1038
01:08:39,352 --> 01:08:42,455
What a woman.

1039
01:08:44,357 --> 01:08:45,760
You no-good,

1040
01:08:46,727 --> 01:08:49,663
lowdown, dirty, lying...

1041
01:08:49,797 --> 01:08:51,098
Rachel, just listen to me.

1042
01:08:51,232 --> 01:08:52,666
What kind of twisted sicko

1043
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,368
tricks someone
into a fake wedding?

1044
01:08:57,138 --> 01:09:00,708
Party's over, Bridezilla.
Stop right there.

1045
01:09:01,408 --> 01:09:03,443
You son of a...

1046
01:09:03,577 --> 01:09:05,645
Have it your way. No!

1047
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:07,715
No!

1048
01:09:10,184 --> 01:09:12,286
Oh. Ugh. Oh!

1049
01:09:12,419 --> 01:09:14,922
Very disappointing,
Agent Handel.

1050
01:09:16,958 --> 01:09:18,993
Ha! Is that supposed
to be a weapon?

1051
01:09:19,126 --> 01:09:20,895
I don't know,
but we gonna find out.

1052
01:09:21,028 --> 01:09:23,496
Haven't you caused
enough trouble for one day?

1053
01:09:23,630 --> 01:09:26,466
I haven't even begun
causing trouble.

1054
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:29,937
Hell hath no fury like
a bride scorned.

1055
01:09:36,576 --> 01:09:40,380
Looks like it's real, huh?

1056
01:09:41,249 --> 01:09:43,084
Whoa! Uh! Ah! Huh?

1057
01:09:43,217 --> 01:09:44,719
No. Right.

1058
01:09:46,419 --> 01:09:48,823
Be honest. How bad is it?

1059
01:09:48,956 --> 01:09:52,492
Not bad at all.
You got Tased. You'll be fine.

1060
01:09:56,364 --> 01:09:57,365
I'm so cold.

1061
01:09:57,497 --> 01:10:00,201
You landed on our ice sculpture.

1062
01:10:00,334 --> 01:10:01,635
Get up.

1063
01:10:07,474 --> 01:10:08,843
Just...

1064
01:10:08,976 --> 01:10:11,812
Just tell me the truth,
for once.

1065
01:10:11,946 --> 01:10:17,584
Is there anything about you
or about us that was real?

1066
01:10:18,185 --> 01:10:21,389
Rachel, look at me.

1067
01:10:21,521 --> 01:10:23,456
Before I met you,

1068
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:26,660
I didn't think that I was even
capable of real happiness.

1069
01:10:27,962 --> 01:10:30,430
But that all changed when
you walked into my life.

1070
01:10:30,563 --> 01:10:34,201
And I ended up breaking the
first rule of undercover work.

1071
01:10:34,335 --> 01:10:36,270
Which is?

1072
01:10:36,404 --> 01:10:38,672
Never fall in love.

1073
01:10:51,052 --> 01:10:52,887
Maddie! Maddie!

1074
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:55,488
We're busting out of here.
How'd you get past the guards?

1075
01:10:55,622 --> 01:10:57,533
Because that little fox
is into some crazy stuff.

1076
01:10:57,557 --> 01:10:59,961
Come on.

1077
01:11:00,094 --> 01:11:02,029
Let's go. You're amazing.

1078
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:15,508
The Owls were fools to think
they could hide this.

1079
01:11:23,516 --> 01:11:25,086
Ah.

1080
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:55,016
What's happening?

1081
01:11:56,484 --> 01:11:58,252
Wait for it.

1082
01:12:09,662 --> 01:12:12,099
Yes. Eureka!

1083
01:12:13,234 --> 01:12:15,036
I've found it!

1084
01:12:34,388 --> 01:12:35,723
Sonic.

1085
01:12:37,458 --> 01:12:39,994
What is that? A big problem.

1086
01:12:40,127 --> 01:12:41,962
The compass led Robotnik
to the Emerald.

1087
01:12:42,096 --> 01:12:44,331
That's got to be
hundreds of miles away.

1088
01:12:45,665 --> 01:12:46,967
All right.

1089
01:12:47,101 --> 01:12:49,136
Huddle up.
Let's figure out a plan.

1090
01:12:49,270 --> 01:12:50,270
Together.

1091
01:12:50,371 --> 01:12:51,705
There's no time for that.

1092
01:12:51,839 --> 01:12:53,483
I'm the only one
that can get there fast enough.

1093
01:12:53,507 --> 01:12:56,043
Sonic, this is way too big
for you to do by yourself.

1094
01:12:56,177 --> 01:12:58,112
You see that little fox
over there?

1095
01:12:58,245 --> 01:13:01,782
He came all the way across
the universe to meet his hero.

1096
01:13:01,916 --> 01:13:05,086
And what did his hero do?
I practically got him killed.

1097
01:13:05,753 --> 01:13:08,022
You know what? You were right.

1098
01:13:08,155 --> 01:13:10,458
My moment came and I blew it.

1099
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:11,759
I'm no hero.

1100
01:13:11,892 --> 01:13:13,060
Wait. No.

1101
01:13:13,194 --> 01:13:14,594
I'm not letting
anyone else get hurt

1102
01:13:14,694 --> 01:13:15,830
because of me.

1103
01:13:15,963 --> 01:13:17,765
I'm gonna fix this
while I still can.

1104
01:13:18,933 --> 01:13:20,568
Sonic!

1105
01:13:20,701 --> 01:13:23,104
Sonic, wait!

1106
01:13:24,905 --> 01:13:27,674
Hold on. Wait. Don't move.

1107
01:13:27,808 --> 01:13:29,477
Take it easy, little guy.
You're hurt.

1108
01:13:29,609 --> 01:13:33,314
But we have to help him. You
don't know what he's up against.

1109
01:13:40,454 --> 01:13:41,989
You believe us now?

1110
01:13:43,757 --> 01:13:45,392
Mm-hmm.

1111
01:13:49,063 --> 01:13:49,897
Hey, Bob!

1112
01:13:50,030 --> 01:13:51,932
Hey, Maria, how you doing? Hey!

1113
01:13:52,066 --> 01:13:53,200
Ah.

1114
01:13:55,302 --> 01:13:56,437
Working on my moves.

1115
01:13:56,570 --> 01:13:58,973
Just keepin' it green.
No need to burn the fuel.

1116
01:13:59,106 --> 01:14:01,275
Speaking of fuel...

1117
01:14:06,646 --> 01:14:09,383
Closed?

1118
01:14:09,517 --> 01:14:11,018
That doesn't seem right.

1119
01:14:23,631 --> 01:14:24,899
Close.

1120
01:14:29,303 --> 01:14:30,471
Yes.

1121
01:14:30,604 --> 01:14:33,174
Makeover, makeover. Look at you.

1122
01:14:33,307 --> 01:14:34,808
Freeze! Police!

1123
01:14:35,876 --> 01:14:37,878
Oh, my God, you got robot hands.

1124
01:14:38,012 --> 01:14:39,146
No, they're gloves.

1125
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,749
Get 'em up.
Now spread your fingers!

1126
01:14:42,816 --> 01:14:45,685
Now wiggle 'em!
Wiggle your digits!

1127
01:14:46,854 --> 01:14:49,823
Yes! Like you just finished
a big musical number.

1128
01:14:51,458 --> 01:14:52,860
Good.

1129
01:14:52,993 --> 01:14:54,728
Why is there
a light on your head?

1130
01:14:58,232 --> 01:15:00,701
'Cause I'm the sheriff
for the weekend, pal.

1131
01:15:08,709 --> 01:15:10,477
Ugh. Water.

1132
01:15:10,611 --> 01:15:12,746
Why did it have to be water?

1133
01:15:15,449 --> 01:15:18,352
Okay, you can do this.

1134
01:15:21,822 --> 01:15:23,724
Gotta go fast.

1135
01:16:53,314 --> 01:16:54,815
Oh!

1136
01:17:05,794 --> 01:17:09,496
I don't want to die
like this! It's derivative!

1137
01:17:10,898 --> 01:17:12,866
Make room for Daddy!

1138
01:17:20,607 --> 01:17:22,376
Two and two. Great!

1139
01:17:22,509 --> 01:17:25,579
We're still bipedals,
more or less.

1140
01:17:28,449 --> 01:17:30,117
Fire in the hole!

1141
01:17:31,852 --> 01:17:35,456
I've solved it. There is a
booby trap every seven seco...

1142
01:17:41,962 --> 01:17:43,931
That was a little early. Mmm.

1143
01:17:44,064 --> 01:17:48,268
Oh! So glad it didn't
cut off my mustache.

1144
01:17:48,402 --> 01:17:51,472
Hey, Little Red Wrecking Ball.

1145
01:17:51,605 --> 01:17:53,808
I know you're dying
to get your Emerald on,

1146
01:17:53,941 --> 01:17:58,379
but can we be a little bit more
mindful of our surroundings?

1147
01:17:58,512 --> 01:17:59,512
May I?

1148
01:18:06,053 --> 01:18:08,655
<i>In 30 feet, turn left.</i>

1149
01:18:08,790 --> 01:18:10,924
Work smarter, not harder.

1150
01:18:32,045 --> 01:18:33,580
My pelvis.

1151
01:18:37,651 --> 01:18:42,189
Okay, Secret Temple,
let's see what you've got.

1152
01:18:48,362 --> 01:18:50,063
Whoa!

1153
01:18:50,197 --> 01:18:52,032
No, no, no! No!

1154
01:18:56,570 --> 01:18:57,604
No.

1155
01:18:58,706 --> 01:19:00,674
Yes!

1156
01:19:05,479 --> 01:19:07,457
<i>You have
arrived at your destination.</i>

1157
01:19:07,481 --> 01:19:10,484
Wow. That really
opened up the space.

1158
01:19:10,617 --> 01:19:13,454
I can't even picture it
with an impenetrable wall now.

1159
01:19:13,587 --> 01:19:15,956
And the rubble
is always a nice touch.

1160
01:19:24,899 --> 01:19:28,602
At last. The Master Emerald.

1161
01:19:28,736 --> 01:19:29,871
Ultimate power.

1162
01:19:30,003 --> 01:19:32,606
Soon order will be restored.

1163
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:36,143
All because of what
we have done together.

1164
01:19:36,276 --> 01:19:38,979
Such a lovely sentiment,
Knuckles.

1165
01:19:39,112 --> 01:19:42,015
I think I feel
a single tear forming.

1166
01:19:44,752 --> 01:19:45,887
Sadly...

1167
01:19:47,187 --> 01:19:48,307
You're as useful to me now

1168
01:19:48,388 --> 01:19:52,226
as a backstage pass
to Limp Bizkit.

1169
01:19:52,359 --> 01:19:54,762
Whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

1170
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:07,440
Nailed it.

1171
01:20:08,710 --> 01:20:12,780
This guy is always trying
to spoil a bad thing!

1172
01:20:12,914 --> 01:20:14,548
Ah! You guys are here, too?

1173
01:20:14,681 --> 01:20:15,917
Took the long way, huh?

1174
01:20:16,049 --> 01:20:18,118
Is everything a joke to you?

1175
01:20:18,252 --> 01:20:20,955
Why must you constantly
interfere with my destiny?

1176
01:20:21,088 --> 01:20:24,959
Because my destiny is to
protect my friends and family.

1177
01:20:25,092 --> 01:20:26,961
I think I just threw up
in my mouth.

1178
01:20:27,127 --> 01:20:33,467
And if you want that emerald,
you're gonna have to go through me.

1179
01:20:38,873 --> 01:20:40,340
Whoa!

1180
01:20:55,455 --> 01:20:58,425
The Echidna's
taking no prisoners today!

1181
01:20:58,559 --> 01:21:02,596
Sonic has heart,
but will he lose the quill to live?

1182
01:21:04,032 --> 01:21:08,201
I don't want to fight you,
but you're not giving me much choice.

1183
01:21:13,373 --> 01:21:17,578
Too easy. Let's do this.

1184
01:21:23,051 --> 01:21:24,484
Huh?

1185
01:21:44,471 --> 01:21:48,943
Why don't you stand still
and die with honor?

1186
01:21:49,077 --> 01:21:50,210
Let me think about it.

1187
01:21:50,344 --> 01:21:54,015
Okay, I thought about it
and I pass.

1188
01:22:03,457 --> 01:22:05,225
Hi there, beautiful.

1189
01:22:06,259 --> 01:22:08,796
You're the real deal,
aren't you?

1190
01:22:16,236 --> 01:22:18,706
Say goodbye, hedgehog.

1191
01:22:21,976 --> 01:22:25,046
Knuckles, stop.
Robotnik's stealing the Emerald!

1192
01:22:25,178 --> 01:22:27,681
What kind of fool
do you take me for?

1193
01:22:27,815 --> 01:22:29,249
Just look.

1194
01:22:31,652 --> 01:22:33,153
Mine.

1195
01:22:34,122 --> 01:22:36,824
Wait! That wasn't the deal.

1196
01:22:39,027 --> 01:22:42,830
Oh, you poor, naive creature.

1197
01:22:42,964 --> 01:22:44,698
It's not your fault.

1198
01:22:44,832 --> 01:22:48,069
A more advanced intellect would
have seen this move coming a mile away.

1199
01:22:48,201 --> 01:22:50,337
Or 1.6 kilometers.

1200
01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:53,206
But I trusted you!
You were my friend!

1201
01:23:00,247 --> 01:23:03,517
I'm sorry.
That just hit me funny.

1202
01:23:03,650 --> 01:23:06,186
Let this be
my final lesson to you,

1203
01:23:06,319 --> 01:23:08,923
you dim-witted
celestial skin tag.

1204
01:23:09,857 --> 01:23:10,925
Friends...

1205
01:23:11,059 --> 01:23:14,996
are open, honest
and vulnerable with each other.

1206
01:23:15,129 --> 01:23:17,664
Which means X squared times
the hypotenuse of Y squared,

1207
01:23:17,799 --> 01:23:21,135
divided by the absolute value
of friendship, equals...

1208
01:23:21,268 --> 01:23:22,268
dookie!

1209
01:23:22,369 --> 01:23:23,805
Oh, no.

1210
01:23:31,879 --> 01:23:36,751
Chaos is power!

1211
01:23:55,136 --> 01:23:56,871
Let's get out of here!

1212
01:24:09,382 --> 01:24:10,752
Knuckles!

1213
01:24:15,089 --> 01:24:18,025
Water again? Come on!

1214
01:24:37,812 --> 01:24:39,947
Mmm?

1215
01:24:40,081 --> 01:24:41,916
Mmm?

1216
01:24:42,049 --> 01:24:43,785
Mmm. Mmm.

1217
01:24:44,819 --> 01:24:45,987
Mmm?

1218
01:25:16,583 --> 01:25:17,819
You saved me.

1219
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:20,721
Don't talk to me.
I'm not in the mood.

1220
01:25:21,989 --> 01:25:25,692
How dare you attack me
in my hour of sorrow!

1221
01:25:27,028 --> 01:25:28,628
Why did you save me?

1222
01:25:30,430 --> 01:25:32,033
Because you saved me first,

1223
01:25:32,166 --> 01:25:35,837
which clearly gave you a tactical
advantage I do not understand.

1224
01:25:35,970 --> 01:25:39,807
It wasn't a tactic.
I couldn't just let you die.

1225
01:25:39,941 --> 01:25:41,809
Why?

1226
01:25:41,943 --> 01:25:45,213
I've been trying to destroy
you since the moment we met.

1227
01:25:45,345 --> 01:25:49,217
Because being a hero isn't
about taking care of yourself.

1228
01:25:49,349 --> 01:25:53,120
It's about taking responsibility
for other people.

1229
01:25:54,155 --> 01:25:58,458
Hmm. Wise words.
An ancient Earth proverb?

1230
01:25:58,592 --> 01:26:00,862
No, sir, that's
a Wachowski family special.

1231
01:26:00,995 --> 01:26:03,663
I got it from a guy
in a rowboat.

1232
01:26:03,798 --> 01:26:05,333
Someone who means a lot to me.

1233
01:26:07,335 --> 01:26:09,036
Wait a second.
What's that sound?

1234
01:26:10,938 --> 01:26:14,474
Only Sonic the Hedgehog
needs rescuing this much.

1235
01:26:14,608 --> 01:26:17,812
That sly little fox!

1236
01:26:20,014 --> 01:26:23,017
Come on, Knucklehead.
We're not beat yet.

1237
01:26:23,150 --> 01:26:25,887
On the mountain,
you told me you'd lost everything.

1238
01:26:26,020 --> 01:26:27,788
The way I did.

1239
01:26:27,922 --> 01:26:30,892
But you seem
so hopeful and free.

1240
01:26:31,025 --> 01:26:35,329
How did you move forward
despite failing again?

1241
01:26:35,462 --> 01:26:39,033
And again. And again.
And again. And again.

1242
01:26:39,166 --> 01:26:42,803
Okay, I didn't fail that much.
But I didn't do this all alone.

1243
01:26:42,937 --> 01:26:45,538
I found a new family.
New friends.

1244
01:26:45,672 --> 01:26:47,440
And you can too.

1245
01:26:49,442 --> 01:26:52,013
You don't have to be
alone anymore.

1246
01:26:54,882 --> 01:26:56,884
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

1247
01:26:57,018 --> 01:26:59,921
Are you kidding me
with that handshake?

1248
01:27:01,688 --> 01:27:03,891
I'm done
playing games, pal.

1249
01:27:04,759 --> 01:27:06,794
You're gonna tell me
what I want to know.

1250
01:27:08,896 --> 01:27:12,632
And I am asking you
for the last time...

1251
01:27:14,668 --> 01:27:16,971
what would you like
on your bagel?

1252
01:27:17,104 --> 01:27:19,173
I'm not telling you anything.

1253
01:27:19,307 --> 01:27:21,976
And that is a display bagel.

1254
01:27:22,109 --> 01:27:25,413
I don't get it with you!
I mean, I've tried everything.

1255
01:27:25,545 --> 01:27:26,914
I was good cop. I was bad cop.

1256
01:27:27,048 --> 01:27:29,183
I was cop
who offers you a bagel.

1257
01:27:29,317 --> 01:27:30,384
And nothing. It's like...

1258
01:27:30,517 --> 01:27:32,519
That is a display bagel. Wow.

1259
01:27:41,829 --> 01:27:43,831
Doctor, you're here.

1260
01:27:45,399 --> 01:27:50,570
Yes,
I'm here, and yet I'm...

1261
01:27:51,973 --> 01:27:53,441
not all there.

1262
01:27:53,573 --> 01:27:55,109
Sir, are you feeling okay?

1263
01:27:55,242 --> 01:27:59,914
I'm more than okay.

1264
01:28:00,047 --> 01:28:03,084
I'm upgraded.

1265
01:28:03,217 --> 01:28:06,187
Sinister 3.0.

1266
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:10,124
My game is next level.

1267
01:28:15,396 --> 01:28:16,764
Hi.

1268
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:25,473
I can smell the electricity
in your brain.

1269
01:28:27,408 --> 01:28:29,877
You smell like a snack plate.

1270
01:28:30,978 --> 01:28:34,581
Yeah, no, that's fair.
I had a couple today.

1271
01:28:34,715 --> 01:28:36,516
Sit down.

1272
01:28:41,022 --> 01:28:42,589
In the chair.

1273
01:28:45,525 --> 01:28:47,395
I didn't know.

1274
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:50,731
'Cause he was in the chair,
so I didn't... Okay.

1275
01:28:50,865 --> 01:28:53,034
Sir? We have a problem.

1276
01:28:58,538 --> 01:29:01,641
- All teams in position!
- Set up a perimeter!

1277
01:29:01,776 --> 01:29:03,643
Move! Move! Move!

1278
01:29:18,526 --> 01:29:22,263
<i>Incorrectus, my trusty barnacle.</i>

1279
01:29:23,497 --> 01:29:26,100
After all these years,

1280
01:29:26,599 --> 01:29:28,601
what I finally got...

1281
01:29:29,503 --> 01:29:31,772
is a solution.

1282
01:29:42,049 --> 01:29:43,683
Commander. Status report.

1283
01:29:43,818 --> 01:29:47,321
Robotnik is in there with Stone
and a hostage. Possibly local PD.

1284
01:29:47,455 --> 01:29:50,825
I'm not saying he's dumb,
but if he is local PD,

1285
01:29:50,958 --> 01:29:53,327
this town's in a lot of trouble.

1286
01:29:53,461 --> 01:29:54,929
Wade.

1287
01:30:06,307 --> 01:30:08,008
Um...

1288
01:30:09,210 --> 01:30:10,778
Okay.

1289
01:30:10,911 --> 01:30:13,547
Rockin' that new
spring collection, I see.

1290
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:18,252
Well, if it isn't
the Pastry King.

1291
01:30:18,385 --> 01:30:19,753
The Donut Lord.

1292
01:30:19,887 --> 01:30:21,765
A real genius would remember
the name of the guy

1293
01:30:21,789 --> 01:30:23,457
who helped kick your butt
off this planet.

1294
01:30:23,591 --> 01:30:25,551
And I'll do it again
if you mess with Green Hills.

1295
01:30:25,625 --> 01:30:30,397
Congratulations on your
oh-so-temporary sense of superiority.

1296
01:30:30,531 --> 01:30:32,933
You're finished, Robotnik!
We've taken everything.

1297
01:30:33,067 --> 01:30:35,569
Your lab, your drones,
your funding!

1298
01:30:35,703 --> 01:30:39,273
Let's see how big of a man you
are without your silly little robots.

1299
01:30:40,841 --> 01:30:43,010
Would you like to see how...

1300
01:30:44,345 --> 01:30:46,679
big a man I can be?

1301
01:30:57,358 --> 01:31:00,728
Welcome to the new norm.

1302
01:31:10,738 --> 01:31:12,273
My God!

1303
01:31:15,643 --> 01:31:19,446
Doctor! Take me with you!

1304
01:31:43,771 --> 01:31:46,507
He's taking everything apart.

1305
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:48,209
He's building something.

1306
01:31:55,983 --> 01:31:58,219
That can only be one thing.

1307
01:31:58,352 --> 01:32:00,788
The fearsome power
of the Emerald.

1308
01:32:00,921 --> 01:32:03,224
If that thing really
turns thoughts into power,

1309
01:32:03,357 --> 01:32:04,959
we are in big trouble.

1310
01:32:05,092 --> 01:32:06,961
Robotnik has a lot
of bad thoughts.

1311
01:32:07,094 --> 01:32:09,997
Hey, Sonic, are you sure
it was a good idea

1312
01:32:10,130 --> 01:32:11,799
bringing you-know-who aboard?

1313
01:32:11,932 --> 01:32:15,536
Knuckles isn't really a bad guy.
He's just a little mixed up.

1314
01:32:15,669 --> 01:32:17,171
I am not mixed up!

1315
01:32:17,304 --> 01:32:20,608
I have steely focus.
And I'm complex.

1316
01:32:20,741 --> 01:32:22,343
And that's a lot
for some people.

1317
01:32:22,476 --> 01:32:25,714
Hope you're not
still mad I hit you with that car.

1318
01:32:25,846 --> 01:32:28,115
Pfft!
I was completely uninjured.

1319
01:32:28,249 --> 01:32:31,919
And my revenge will come
when you least expect it, fox.

1320
01:32:58,145 --> 01:32:59,380
Whoa.

1321
01:33:02,950 --> 01:33:05,552
Sir, you're magnificent!

1322
01:33:05,686 --> 01:33:07,655
Thank you, sycophant.

1323
01:33:07,788 --> 01:33:10,357
Your admiration is inevitable.

1324
01:33:20,367 --> 01:33:21,669
I knew it!

1325
01:33:21,802 --> 01:33:24,438
Just like the Stay Puft
Marshmallow Man.

1326
01:33:25,272 --> 01:33:27,441
World Domination playlist.

1327
01:33:40,789 --> 01:33:42,156
Fall back.

1328
01:33:43,257 --> 01:33:46,360
Fall back! Quick! Retreat!

1329
01:33:48,128 --> 01:33:50,331
How are we supposed
to beat this thing?

1330
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:51,265
We need a plan.

1331
01:33:51,398 --> 01:33:53,934
Knuckles, use your strength to...

1332
01:33:54,068 --> 01:33:56,270
Jump off the plane. Wow.

1333
01:33:56,403 --> 01:34:00,474
Okay, this is what we're
gonna do. Step 1: Light taunting.

1334
01:34:00,607 --> 01:34:02,443
Step 2: I have no idea.

1335
01:34:05,512 --> 01:34:06,880
Sonic!

1336
01:34:09,784 --> 01:34:11,485
Nice action figure, Eggman.

1337
01:34:11,618 --> 01:34:14,988
Does it do anything or just
stand there looking ugly?

1338
01:34:18,292 --> 01:34:21,695
Like a blister,
he keeps coming back!

1339
01:34:21,830 --> 01:34:24,733
He's on the okay-to-kill list. Shoot
the missiles. Make a decision.

1340
01:34:24,865 --> 01:34:27,836
I need a moment, sir. I'm
trying to figure out how to do this.

1341
01:34:27,968 --> 01:34:29,970
Did you even glance at a manual?

1342
01:34:30,104 --> 01:34:32,373
No! I'll do it.

1343
01:34:32,506 --> 01:34:33,574
Pardon my lightning.

1344
01:34:33,708 --> 01:34:36,043
You might want to
ground yourself.

1345
01:34:37,511 --> 01:34:38,946
Uh-oh.

1346
01:34:39,079 --> 01:34:42,851
I'm gonna pop that thing open
like a can of chili...

1347
01:34:42,983 --> 01:34:43,983
Whoa!

1348
01:34:44,084 --> 01:34:45,886
Hang on!

1349
01:34:47,621 --> 01:34:49,490
Whoa!

1350
01:34:51,892 --> 01:34:54,294
Whoa!

1351
01:34:56,964 --> 01:34:58,198
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

1352
01:34:58,332 --> 01:35:00,934
Oh,
yeah! Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Close one.

1353
01:35:01,068 --> 01:35:03,237
Sonic!

1354
01:35:06,808 --> 01:35:08,509
Robotnik!

1355
01:35:09,977 --> 01:35:11,512
Deceiver!

1356
01:35:11,645 --> 01:35:13,480
Die, mosquito.

1357
01:35:24,925 --> 01:35:27,027
Ooh! I felt that.

1358
01:35:39,506 --> 01:35:42,176
Oh! Whoa!

1359
01:35:45,946 --> 01:35:47,314
What just happened?

1360
01:35:47,448 --> 01:35:51,018
It's the Stache Masher.
Right here in the manual.

1361
01:35:53,020 --> 01:35:55,522
Return to sender.

1362
01:36:02,864 --> 01:36:04,198
Stone?

1363
01:36:05,098 --> 01:36:06,935
Oh, great.

1364
01:36:07,067 --> 01:36:10,204
Next thing you know, there'll be a
report about a hostile work environment.

1365
01:36:12,841 --> 01:36:15,910
Those were our best attacks,
and they did nothing!

1366
01:36:16,043 --> 01:36:18,645
We can't beat Robotnik as
long as he's got that Emerald.

1367
01:36:18,780 --> 01:36:20,280
He's too powerful.

1368
01:36:20,414 --> 01:36:23,183
Look, we aren't strong enough
to beat Robotnik on our own.

1369
01:36:23,317 --> 01:36:24,451
But there's three of us.

1370
01:36:24,585 --> 01:36:27,856
Your strength, your smarts
and my speed.

1371
01:36:27,988 --> 01:36:29,456
Together. That's how we win.

1372
01:36:29,590 --> 01:36:34,294
So we make our stand here
on the field of battle.

1373
01:36:34,428 --> 01:36:35,662
As a team.

1374
01:36:35,797 --> 01:36:37,431
This is it.

1375
01:36:38,699 --> 01:36:41,468
This is our moment.

1376
01:36:43,270 --> 01:36:45,105
Time to fight.

1377
01:36:52,079 --> 01:36:56,049
Bad time to say this,
but I don't actually have a plan.

1378
01:36:56,818 --> 01:36:58,418
Tails, any ideas?

1379
01:36:58,552 --> 01:37:00,220
We have to find his weak spot.

1380
01:37:00,354 --> 01:37:01,990
I suggest the groin.

1381
01:37:02,122 --> 01:37:04,124
What? No. No!

1382
01:37:04,258 --> 01:37:06,861
Traditionally, yes,
the groin is the weakest spot.

1383
01:37:06,995 --> 01:37:08,963
Stop saying "groin."

1384
01:37:09,129 --> 01:37:10,865
Hedgehog!

1385
01:37:10,999 --> 01:37:12,499
Look out!

1386
01:37:14,903 --> 01:37:17,638
I know what his
weak spot is. It's me.

1387
01:37:17,772 --> 01:37:19,606
I'm the groin!

1388
01:37:22,075 --> 01:37:23,243
Think about it. Whoa!

1389
01:37:23,377 --> 01:37:24,979
I live rent-free
in this dude's head.

1390
01:37:25,112 --> 01:37:26,714
So if I go out there
and rile him up...

1391
01:37:26,848 --> 01:37:29,316
He'll focus on only you,
leaving himself open

1392
01:37:29,449 --> 01:37:31,585
to a flanking maneuver
from me and the fox!

1393
01:37:31,719 --> 01:37:34,454
Hedgehog,
you are a brave and noble warrior.

1394
01:37:34,588 --> 01:37:37,257
Go to your certain death
with honor.

1395
01:37:37,391 --> 01:37:39,459
We're gonna have to work
on your pep talks, pal.

1396
01:37:39,593 --> 01:37:42,162
Yeah. Let's go.

1397
01:37:45,699 --> 01:37:47,134
All right, mustache.

1398
01:37:47,267 --> 01:37:50,070
You want me? Come and get me.

1399
01:37:50,203 --> 01:37:52,740
You don't tell me
about coming and getting.

1400
01:37:52,874 --> 01:37:55,509
I am on the cutting edge
of coming and getting!

1401
01:37:55,642 --> 01:37:57,311
Coming, getting.

1402
01:37:57,444 --> 01:38:01,816
Coming, getting. Coming,
getting. Coming, getting.

1403
01:38:04,251 --> 01:38:06,054
Oh, you're really heavy.

1404
01:38:06,186 --> 01:38:10,490
That's because I am one million
percent muscle. Faster, fox!

1405
01:38:12,225 --> 01:38:15,696
Go! Move, guys! Move back! Let's go,
that's it! Go, go, go!

1406
01:38:15,830 --> 01:38:16,830
Keep going! Go! Go!

1407
01:38:16,931 --> 01:38:18,733
No, no! Stop! Stop the truck!

1408
01:38:18,866 --> 01:38:20,367
Tom, what happened here?

1409
01:38:20,500 --> 01:38:23,037
You thinking what I'm
thinking? Let's get our kid.

1410
01:38:23,170 --> 01:38:24,706
We need your truck!

1411
01:38:30,644 --> 01:38:33,881
Coming,
getting. Whew!

1412
01:38:34,015 --> 01:38:35,616
Yoo-hoo!

1413
01:38:35,750 --> 01:38:37,451
So what's the
plan here?

1414
01:38:37,584 --> 01:38:38,418
Huh?

1415
01:38:38,552 --> 01:38:40,287
You gonna build
a big robot house?

1416
01:38:40,420 --> 01:38:42,724
Get yourself a big robot wife?

1417
01:38:42,857 --> 01:38:47,260
I'm going to enslave humanity and
force them to service my machines.

1418
01:38:47,394 --> 01:38:50,197
First, Green Hills.
Then the universe.

1419
01:38:50,330 --> 01:38:51,565
Then the multiverse.

1420
01:38:51,698 --> 01:38:54,568
Then who knows?
Maybe that'll be enough.

1421
01:38:54,702 --> 01:38:56,570
Full disclosure?

1422
01:38:57,237 --> 01:39:00,140
You won't be there.

1423
01:39:04,344 --> 01:39:06,680
Eye lasers? Really?

1424
01:39:19,027 --> 01:39:21,228
Snot rocket!

1425
01:39:22,663 --> 01:39:23,731
No, no, no!

1426
01:39:30,237 --> 01:39:33,240
Giving up already?

1427
01:39:33,373 --> 01:39:37,577
Not so tough when you're fighting
someone 700 times your size, are ya?

1428
01:39:39,446 --> 01:39:41,949
You can't beat me!

1429
01:39:42,083 --> 01:39:45,485
I'm all-powerful! All-knowing!

1430
01:39:48,022 --> 01:39:50,424
All-seeing.

1431
01:39:51,291 --> 01:39:53,493
Looks like your fancy robot
has a glitch.

1432
01:39:53,627 --> 01:39:55,839
Is it me?
What about me? I'm over here.

1433
01:39:55,863 --> 01:39:57,698
Up top! Down below!
Behind you!

1434
01:39:57,832 --> 01:39:59,912
I'm
over here. Sorry! Over here.

1435
01:40:00,034 --> 01:40:01,568
Too slow! Try again.

1436
01:40:01,703 --> 01:40:03,871
You can't outsmart me.
Missed me again.

1437
01:40:04,005 --> 01:40:05,006
I'm the outsmarter-er!

1438
01:40:09,911 --> 01:40:13,014
I didn't outsmart you.
I'm just the distraction.

1439
01:40:13,147 --> 01:40:14,949
Robotnik!

1440
01:40:15,083 --> 01:40:17,819
I am also a hologram.

1441
01:40:17,952 --> 01:40:19,821
Disloyal.

1442
01:40:19,954 --> 01:40:22,857
"Dis" is how I roll.

1443
01:40:51,152 --> 01:40:52,820
Where's my Emerald?

1444
01:40:53,420 --> 01:40:55,223
No, no, no, no!

1445
01:40:55,355 --> 01:40:57,859
Computer, auxiliary power.

1446
01:41:05,166 --> 01:41:06,768
Oh.

1447
01:41:06,901 --> 01:41:09,804
The Emerald. It's right there.

1448
01:41:09,937 --> 01:41:11,906
Move, you hunk of junk!

1449
01:41:16,309 --> 01:41:19,847
I have to... reach it.

1450
01:41:43,004 --> 01:41:44,038
Come on.

1451
01:41:46,140 --> 01:41:48,508
There he is! Go! Go, go, go!

1452
01:41:57,218 --> 01:41:58,218
No!

1453
01:41:58,318 --> 01:41:59,787
We got you, Sonic.

1454
01:42:00,922 --> 01:42:02,489
Hold on!

1455
01:42:15,435 --> 01:42:17,872
- You guys okay?
- Yeah.

1456
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:20,975
Okay.

1457
01:42:25,713 --> 01:42:27,681
I got the Emerald.
We could still defeat him.

1458
01:42:27,815 --> 01:42:31,085
Come on, come on. How does
this thing work? What do I do?

1459
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:34,055
What?

1460
01:42:34,188 --> 01:42:36,991
No. No, no, no!

1461
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:45,032
Look at the happy little family.

1462
01:42:50,705 --> 01:42:53,241
You have to get away from
me. I'm the one he wants.

1463
01:42:53,373 --> 01:42:54,641
Hey.

1464
01:42:54,775 --> 01:42:56,409
We're not going anywhere.

1465
01:42:56,543 --> 01:42:58,511
We're family.

1466
01:43:01,749 --> 01:43:03,718
And families stick together...

1467
01:43:06,386 --> 01:43:07,788
no matter what.

1468
01:43:10,657 --> 01:43:11,993
I love you guys.

1469
01:43:12,692 --> 01:43:14,262
We love you too, Sonic.

1470
01:43:22,937 --> 01:43:24,537
No!

1471
01:43:26,340 --> 01:43:28,408
I got him!

1472
01:43:28,541 --> 01:43:34,348
I finally got him!

1473
01:43:37,584 --> 01:43:39,619
What was that?

1474
01:44:25,299 --> 01:44:27,201
It's over, Eggman.

1475
01:44:27,335 --> 01:44:31,872
I like the
new look. It works for you.

1476
01:44:32,006 --> 01:44:34,942
What do you say
we just let bygones be bygones?

1477
01:44:35,076 --> 01:44:36,911
I did some things,
you did some things.

1478
01:44:37,044 --> 01:44:39,113
There are good people
on both sides.

1479
01:44:40,647 --> 01:44:43,951
Surely two intelligent beings

1480
01:44:45,518 --> 01:44:47,755
can work these things out!

1481
01:44:59,532 --> 01:45:00,532
Come on, buddy.

1482
01:45:00,633 --> 01:45:02,036
Get him, Sonic! Come on.

1483
01:45:02,169 --> 01:45:03,670
Yeah. Come on.

1484
01:45:19,887 --> 01:45:21,688
It's like that?

1485
01:45:22,857 --> 01:45:25,525
Okay, we're not friends.

1486
01:45:29,662 --> 01:45:32,099
Later, hater!

1487
01:45:43,377 --> 01:45:45,279
Sonic! Buddy!

1488
01:45:45,413 --> 01:45:47,181
Wait! You cannot touch him!

1489
01:45:47,314 --> 01:45:49,984
The hedgehog holds
the power of the Emerald.

1490
01:45:50,117 --> 01:45:54,722
I am sorry. He is no longer
the Sonic you once knew.

1491
01:45:55,156 --> 01:45:56,190
What?

1492
01:46:14,574 --> 01:46:15,709
Mmm.

1493
01:46:15,843 --> 01:46:17,845
Oh, you got to try this.

1494
01:46:23,217 --> 01:46:26,921
Okay. He is exactly
the Sonic you once knew.

1495
01:46:28,588 --> 01:46:30,124
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

1496
01:46:38,466 --> 01:46:40,201
Sonic! Whoa!

1497
01:46:41,769 --> 01:46:43,670
Bring it in, bud.

1498
01:46:44,805 --> 01:46:46,507
It's good to be back in blue.

1499
01:46:46,639 --> 01:46:50,244
The golden god thing was fun,
but blue has always been more my color.

1500
01:46:50,377 --> 01:46:51,479
Looks good on you.

1501
01:46:51,611 --> 01:46:54,048
Sonic, you were
the most powerful hero

1502
01:46:54,181 --> 01:46:56,984
in the universe,
and you let it go.

1503
01:46:57,118 --> 01:46:58,219
Why?

1504
01:46:59,787 --> 01:47:03,124
Because I still have
some growing up to do.

1505
01:47:05,092 --> 01:47:07,461
And I kind of like being a kid.

1506
01:47:07,595 --> 01:47:09,430
And you're not just any kid.

1507
01:47:09,563 --> 01:47:11,398
You're our kid.

1508
01:47:11,532 --> 01:47:12,800
That's right.

1509
01:47:12,933 --> 01:47:15,436
Bring it in! Yay. Hugs.

1510
01:47:15,569 --> 01:47:18,873
It's a good thing we didn't do
this before. You would've blown up.

1511
01:47:26,147 --> 01:47:27,748
Whoa! You fixed it.

1512
01:47:27,882 --> 01:47:31,285
I've spent my whole life
questing for this.

1513
01:47:31,418 --> 01:47:32,586
Now I have it.

1514
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:34,488
Now we have it.

1515
01:47:34,622 --> 01:47:37,024
What do we do with it?
What next?

1516
01:47:37,158 --> 01:47:39,193
There were once
two orders of heroes

1517
01:47:39,326 --> 01:47:43,364
who protected the galaxy from those
who would use the Emerald for evil.

1518
01:47:43,497 --> 01:47:47,535
But they have all passed on to
the great battleground in the sky.

1519
01:47:47,667 --> 01:47:51,172
So we start a new order.
The three of us.

1520
01:47:51,305 --> 01:47:52,672
This is no light task.

1521
01:47:52,806 --> 01:47:57,845
We must make a vow to use our
powers to keep the universe safe,

1522
01:47:58,512 --> 01:48:00,314
to watch out for each other.

1523
01:48:00,447 --> 01:48:02,149
Our new tribe.

1524
01:48:02,283 --> 01:48:03,317
Oh, I know!

1525
01:48:03,450 --> 01:48:04,684
A power bump!

1526
01:48:04,818 --> 01:48:06,487
Good idea.

1527
01:48:06,620 --> 01:48:10,124
It's an Earth custom.
An unbreakable promise.

1528
01:48:10,257 --> 01:48:12,126
Very well.

1529
01:48:12,726 --> 01:48:15,296
A power bump it is.

1530
01:48:16,397 --> 01:48:18,165
Power bump!

1531
01:48:21,869 --> 01:48:23,604
It's truly a beautiful day

1532
01:48:23,737 --> 01:48:25,906
for baseball here
in Green Hills.

1533
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:27,741
An exciting lineup today

1534
01:48:27,875 --> 01:48:31,045
with the debut appearance
of two new players!

1535
01:48:31,178 --> 01:48:35,449
On the mound,
rookie sensation from across the galaxy,

1536
01:48:35,583 --> 01:48:37,952
Miles "Tails" Prower,

1537
01:48:38,085 --> 01:48:43,324
facing off against the powerhouse,
Knuckles the Echidna.

1538
01:48:43,457 --> 01:48:46,060
Um, I don't understand.

1539
01:48:46,193 --> 01:48:48,462
Why am I angry
at the enemy ball?

1540
01:48:48,596 --> 01:48:49,763
You're not angry.

1541
01:48:49,897 --> 01:48:51,599
You just want to hit it
as hard as you can

1542
01:48:51,732 --> 01:48:52,933
and then run around the bases.

1543
01:48:53,067 --> 01:48:56,270
But if my quest ends
where I am standing,

1544
01:48:56,403 --> 01:48:57,805
why run at all?

1545
01:48:57,938 --> 01:49:00,874
Ugh. I can't with this guy.
Why do I even try?

1546
01:49:01,008 --> 01:49:03,677
This is just a game.
We're out here having fun.

1547
01:49:03,811 --> 01:49:05,346
Just having some fun.

1548
01:49:05,479 --> 01:49:07,848
Fun. Huh.

1549
01:49:07,982 --> 01:49:10,217
All right!
Give him the heat, Tails!

1550
01:49:10,351 --> 01:49:12,219
Hope you're ready
for my fastball.

1551
01:49:12,353 --> 01:49:14,855
Your fastball
will be dishonored.

1552
01:49:14,989 --> 01:49:17,324
And so will you, fox.

1553
01:49:17,458 --> 01:49:18,492
Easy, guys!

1554
01:49:18,626 --> 01:49:19,860
Don't think about it too much.

1555
01:49:19,994 --> 01:49:21,895
Just keep your elbow up,
eye on the ball

1556
01:49:22,029 --> 01:49:23,297
and give it a ride.

1557
01:49:23,430 --> 01:49:24,999
A ride? To where?

1558
01:49:28,969 --> 01:49:30,437
Power bump!

1559
01:49:34,775 --> 01:49:36,944
Ha! Victory is mine!

1560
01:49:37,077 --> 01:49:39,647
Hey, no fair!
That shouldn't count.

1561
01:49:39,780 --> 01:49:41,915
First base is also mine!

1562
01:49:42,049 --> 01:49:43,752
I think that was our
only ball.

1563
01:49:43,884 --> 01:49:46,654
I have conquered
the second of the bases!

1564
01:49:46,787 --> 01:49:48,155
Who wants ice cream?

1565
01:49:48,289 --> 01:49:49,590
Knocked the cover off that.

1566
01:49:49,724 --> 01:49:52,026
Ice cream! Ice cream, yeah!

1567
01:49:52,159 --> 01:49:56,163
I am having
the fun! What is ice cream?

1568
01:49:56,297 --> 01:49:59,500
It's a dessert. If you like fun,
you're gonna love it.

1569
01:49:59,633 --> 01:50:02,903
Oh, yum. Dessert.
Does it have grapes in it?

1570
01:50:03,037 --> 01:50:04,638
No, not usually.

1571
01:50:04,773 --> 01:50:07,074
I'm proud of our little guy.

1572
01:50:07,207 --> 01:50:10,712
I really like his new friends,
especially the red one.

1573
01:50:10,844 --> 01:50:13,480
He cracks me up.
Heck of a swing too.

1574
01:50:13,614 --> 01:50:14,749
Come on, fox.

1575
01:50:14,882 --> 01:50:16,517
Our dessert adventure
awaits. Whoo!

1576
01:50:16,650 --> 01:50:17,685
Good job, guys. Yeah.

1577
01:50:17,818 --> 01:50:19,119
You too, baby.

1578
01:50:19,253 --> 01:50:22,056
Let's go get some ice cream.
Come on, come on.

1579
01:50:22,189 --> 01:50:24,458
I'm happy for you, pal.

1580
01:50:24,591 --> 01:50:25,993
Got your wingmen.

1581
01:50:26,126 --> 01:50:27,461
Perfect friends to grow up with.

1582
01:50:27,594 --> 01:50:31,265
Come on,
Knuckles. Ah! My victory chariot!

1583
01:50:33,067 --> 01:50:36,270
I've got a lot more
than that... Dad.

1584
01:50:41,608 --> 01:50:43,110
Race you to the truck.

1585
01:50:44,611 --> 01:50:45,879
One, two, three, go!

1586
01:50:46,013 --> 01:50:48,449
No, don't go easy on me.
I want your best.

1587
01:50:48,582 --> 01:50:51,485
Sonic, I have just been told
they have sprinkles.

1588
01:50:51,618 --> 01:50:55,289
Ice cream and sprinkles?
This is your new destiny.

1589
01:50:55,422 --> 01:51:00,294
What a perfect meal to celebrate
my victory over you in base of ball.

1590
01:51:00,427 --> 01:51:03,130
What? I mean,
you barely beat me.

1591
01:51:03,263 --> 01:51:06,500
Ha! You've never been
beaten so hard.

1592
01:51:10,805 --> 01:51:12,172
Can't forget this.

Agent, I want an update.

1633
01:53:13,026 --> 01:53:16,096
Still searching,
sir. We haven't found any sign of Robotnik.

1634
01:53:16,230 --> 01:53:18,465
No one could've
survived that crash.

1635
01:53:18,599 --> 01:53:21,769
He's toast. Good riddance.

1636
01:53:21,903 --> 01:53:25,038
What a mess that lunatic made.

1637
01:53:25,172 --> 01:53:27,809
Sir, there's something else.

1638
01:53:27,942 --> 01:53:31,846
When we were wiping Robotnik off
our database, we found something.

1639
01:53:31,980 --> 01:53:35,917
A file buried deep in our system
and dating back over 50 years.

1640
01:53:36,049 --> 01:53:37,584
What was it?

1641
01:53:37,719 --> 01:53:38,920
Coordinates, sir.

1642
01:53:39,052 --> 01:53:40,889
Coordinates? To what?

1643
01:53:41,021 --> 01:53:44,091
<i>A secret research facility.</i>

1644
01:53:44,224 --> 01:53:46,360
<i>It was a black site, sir.</i>

1645
01:53:46,493 --> 01:53:49,296
<i>Someone worked very hard
to keep this hidden.</i>

1646
01:53:50,364 --> 01:53:51,766
<i>My God.</i>

1647
01:53:52,699 --> 01:53:54,201
<i>Project Shadow.</i>
