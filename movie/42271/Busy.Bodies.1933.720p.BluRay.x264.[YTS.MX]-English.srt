2
00:01:24,993 --> 00:01:27,377
What a beautiful morning!

3
00:01:29,597 --> 00:01:32,130
Turn on the radio,
let's have some music.

4
00:01:43,012 --> 00:01:46,366
Isn't it great
to have a good job to go to?

5
00:01:46,391 --> 00:01:48,888
It just makes
the whole world bright.

6
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,232
Well, even you look bright
this morning.

7
00:03:41,762 --> 00:03:43,789
What do you think,
you're trying to do?

8
00:03:43,814 --> 00:03:45,881
Can't you take a little joke?

9
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,011
Why don't you look
where you're going?

10
00:03:51,983 --> 00:03:53,547
Clumsy!

11
00:03:58,057 --> 00:03:59,501
Hey!

12
00:03:59,526 --> 00:04:02,543
- You've got a match?
- Sorry, I don't smoke.

13
00:04:19,817 --> 00:04:21,933
Why don't you look
where you're going?

14
00:05:28,922 --> 00:05:29,948
Argh!

15
00:06:12,012 --> 00:06:13,016
Hey!

16
00:06:13,408 --> 00:06:14,417
Come here.

17
00:06:17,676 --> 00:06:21,241
Give me a hand with this,
I can't get it up or down.

18
00:06:53,433 --> 00:06:54,771
Come here!

19
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,355
Would you mind
opening the window?

20
00:07:08,947 --> 00:07:10,528
Not that one, this one!

21
00:07:10,553 --> 00:07:12,937
I can't get my hands out!

22
00:08:08,078 --> 00:08:11,769
Will you stop messing around,
and get me out of here?

23
00:08:26,516 --> 00:08:28,242
What are you doing?!

24
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:31,692
I was looking at the blueprint,
trying to open the window!

25
00:08:31,716 --> 00:08:34,983
Well, that's a blueprint of Boulder dam!

26
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,759
Hurry up, and get me out of here

27
00:09:24,432 --> 00:09:27,056
That's the second time
you've picked on me.

28
00:09:54,701 --> 00:09:55,987
Thanks buddy!

29
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,109
You know...
I kinda like you.

30
00:09:58,134 --> 00:09:59,944
- You do?
- You bet, I do.

31
00:10:00,258 --> 00:10:02,036
You've got a kind face.

32
00:10:02,777 --> 00:10:03,787
Thanks!

33
00:10:05,152 --> 00:10:07,900
- Have a cigar?
- Don't mind if I do.

34
00:10:11,551 --> 00:10:13,425
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

35
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,456
You dirty little professed...

36
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:38,333
I'll see you guys on lunch time.

37
00:10:38,357 --> 00:10:40,167
Double professed pals!

38
00:12:35,611 --> 00:12:36,834
Hey!

39
00:12:36,859 --> 00:12:39,207
Will you hang this coat
in the closet for me?

40
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,460
Thanks!

41
00:15:19,098 --> 00:15:20,132
Thank you!

42
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,216
You dropped this!

43
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:28,933
Thanks!

44
00:17:52,463 --> 00:17:55,097
Will you let go of my ears?

45
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:02,314
Come in!

46
00:18:57,291 --> 00:19:06,799
