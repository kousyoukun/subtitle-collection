00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,144
它们听你的
They obeyed you.

283
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:23,286
是的
Yes.

284
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,348
对，没错
Yes, they did.

285
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,066
嘿
SONJA: Hey.

286
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:46,466
- 你不该来此- 我必须来
Oh, you should not be here. I had to.

287
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:47,834
我的爱，对不起
My love, I'm sorry.

288
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:50,169
- 你的背- 我没事
Your back. No, no, I'm all right.

289
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:52,303
是我的错，要是我没出去…
This is my fault. If I had not gone out...

290
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:54,842
那你就不是你了
Then you would not be who you are.

291
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:57,981
这不是你的错
This is not your fault.

292
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:02,986
我不能留在这里，我得离开
I cannot remain here. I have to leave this place.

293
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:04,958
我父亲现在会更严加监控你
My father will be watching you now more than ever.

294
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:07,394
禁军呢？里面没你的亲信？
What about your Death Dealers, are there none that you can trust?

295
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:11,059
他们们对我父亲比对我忠心
Unfortunately, their loyalty to my father is greater than their loyalty to me.

296
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:12,534
谭尼斯
Tannis.

297
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:15,998
- 不能相信他- 不，他知道我们的事
Tannis cannot be trusted. No, Tannis, he knows about us.

298
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,207
- 怎么会？- 我不知道，不过
How? I have no idea.

299
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:23,269
若他还没告诉你父亲，那就有鬼
But if he still has not told your father, then that must mean he wants something.

300
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,073
去查他在打什么算盘
Sonja, find out what it is.

301
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:53,908
带他们进来
Bring them in.

302
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:35,983
琼纳
Janosh.

303
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:43,084
你不是拥有最大的银矿吗？
Do you not own the largest silver mine in these lands?

304
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,658
已经都荒废了，大人
It has been overrun, my lord.

305
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,294
工人都受到感染
Our workers infected,

306
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:49,423
变成野兽
turned to beasts.

307
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:50,659
真不幸
VIKTOR: Most unfortunate,

308
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:53,133
牺牲真大
and costly.

309
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,997
我想你矿场一半的权益…
I think half the rights to your mine

310
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:58,439
应该能偿付我们协助的费用吧
should cover the expense of our assistance.

311
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:00,134
你们的协助？
What assistance?

312
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:02,701
我们在来的路上都看到火焰
We have all seen the fires on the way here.

313
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:06,005
也知道巴伦和他家人的死讯
We have learned of the deaths of Baron Covasha and his family.

314
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:07,980
狼群也攻到了你们城下
The wolves are at your door as well.

315
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:10,611
你们连自保都有问题
So why should I pay tribute

316
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,685
我为什么要进贡给你们？
when you cannot so much as protect your own house?

317
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:17,152
你已经把我榨乾了
You have all but bled me dry already.

318
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,489
我们都听说了
We have all heard the stories.

319
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:23,257
看他的眼睛！是真的！
Look into his eyes. They are true.

320
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:25,233
这里受到诅咒
This place is cursed.

321
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:27,770
他们是入侵…
They are no more human

322
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:30,199
我们土地的恶魔
than the devils that invade our lands.

323
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:35,998
放心，跟你认识的恶魔交手 胜过跟不认识的打交道
If devils you call us, rest assured, better the devil you know.

324
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:39,538
- 放开我- 当然
Unhand me. Certainly.

325
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:50,152
还有谁有话要说？
Would anyone else like to be heard?

326
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:55,052
把食物送给这些肮脏的狗
Toss it here. Bring food to these filthy mongrels.

327
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,477
- 来了- 跟狗一样舔吧
Here you go. Eat it up like dogs.

328
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,619
[GUARDS LAUGHING]

329
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:12,174
跟狗一样
MAN: Like dogs.

330
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:31,496
我们不是野兽
We are not animals.

331
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:38,361
难道你们想当他们的玩具？
Is this what you want, to be their entertainment, their playthings?

332
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,540
当他们的宠物？
Their pets.

333
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:43,374
蜷曲在鞭子之下
Cowering beneath the whip

334
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:45,778
却在彼此之间争斗
and then fighting amongst ourselves.

335
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:49,444
这就是你们想要的？
Is this what you want?

336
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:56,454
我一辈子听从他们的指挥
I have lived by their rules my entire life.

337
00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:58,389
我保卫他们
I've protected them,

338
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:00,357
羡慕他们
envied them.

339
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:02,158
结果呢？
And for what?

340
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,631
结果却被当成野兽对待
To be treated like an animal.

341
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:07,395
我们不是野兽
We are not animals!

342
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:12,103
我们有选择
We do have a choice.

343
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,738
我们们可以选择比这更好的
We can choose to be more than this.

344
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:17,805
我们可以是奴隶
We can be slaves

345
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,707
我们也可以是狼人
or we can be Lycans!

346
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:30,817
晨光已现，我的孩子
VIKTOR: Morning is upon us, my child.

347
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:34,827
我们该将不幸的夜置诸脑后
It's time we left this wretched night behind.

348
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:39,052
- 我很乐意- 眼前有一些困难的决策
Gladly.
There are some difficult decisions ahead.

349
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:42,161
- 我希望你帮我解决其中一个- 当然，父亲
I would like your help with one of them.
Of course, Father.

350
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:44,368
失去了路西安
With Lucian gone,

351
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:47,838
我们得拔擢另一个狼人取代他
we must promote another Lycan in his place.

352
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:50,572
失去？
Gone?

353
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:53,275
克洛曼认为他会煽动其他人
Coloman thinks he will stir the others.

354
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:55,147
我们必须除掉他
We must remove him.

355
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:00,179
这很困难
That will be difficult.

356
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,916
他跟我们这么久了
He has been with us so long.

357
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,495
也许用吉尔吧
Perhaps Gyorg.

358
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:16,867
或塞拉索
Or Thrasos.

359
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,473
他们都很…
They would be

360
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,570
值得信赖
trustworthy.

361
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:25,341
很好的建议
Excellent suggestions.

362
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,638
我会仔细考虑
I will consider them strongly.

363
00:36:56,647 --> 00:37:02,370
你，我的孩子 是我心中最珍贵的宝贝
You, my child, are the most precious thing in my heart.

364
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:26,834
你跟我父亲说了什么？
What have you told my father?

365
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:29,502
- 你说了什么？- 什么都没说
What have you told him? Nothing.

366
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:30,875
- 为什么？- 什么为什么？
Why? Why what?

367
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,410
为什么没说？
Why have you told him nothing?

368
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:37,684
你的父亲 会很高兴有人告诉他
Would your father welcome the man who brought him news

369
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,755
他心爱女儿的交往对象…
that his beloved daughter was consorting

370
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,949
是狼人吗？
with a Lycan?

371
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,930
他是知名的冷酷无情
He isn't well known for his gratitude.

372
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:04,768
我还不想利用这个消息 替自己谋福利
And I am not yet in a position to use this for my benefit.

373
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:10,643
什么样的福利？
What sort of benefit?

374
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:15,315
议会的议员有十二席
There are 12 council seats.

375
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,890
我们又不常死人
And we don't die often.

376
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,464
真可惜，是啊
Sadly, no.

377
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,420
要是我放弃我在议会的席次
So, what if I gave up my seat at council?

378
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:24,557
直接留给你呢？
Simply left it to you?

379
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:25,995
你为什么要那么做？
Why would you do that?

380
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:28,731
你能保守秘密吗？
Can you keep a secret?

381
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:34,066
我需要一些回报
I will need something in return.

两分钟
Two minutes.

383
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,726
再久就会有危险
Any longer is too risky.

384
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:09,706
对不起，我没有别的办法
I'm sorry. There was no other way.

385
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:16,377
谭尼斯？
So Tannis?

386
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:20,020
你说的对，他要议会的席位
You were right. He will help us in exchange for a seat on the council.

387
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:22,215
- 而你父亲毫不知情？- 我很确定
Your father knows nothing? I'm sure of it.

388
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,790
- 桑雅，这样行得通- 必须如此
Sonja, this can work. Lucian, it has to.

389
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:26,123
我想有些狼人会跟我走
I think some of the others will come with me.

390
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:27,887
- 萨巴斯、瑞思托、雷兹- 我的爱…
Sabas and Xristo, the human Raze. My love...

391
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,398
- 我肯定可以…- 路西安，没时间了
I'm certain I can... Lucian, there is no time.

392
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:33,662
我父亲明天等人类离开 就会处决你
My father will have you killed tomorrow, after the humans are turned.

393
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:36,068
你必须在天亮时离开
You must leave at sunrise.

394
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,938
- 你呢？- 重要的是你保住性命
And you? The important thing is you stay alive.

395
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:42,901
维多和禁军入睡时 是你的好机会
The best chance you have is when Viktor and the Death Dealers sleep.

396
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,969
你走之后，我在父亲身边很安全
I will be safely at my father's side when you go.

397
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:46,509
快点
TANNIS: Hurry.

398
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,580
计划若成功，三天后日落时见
If this plan works, I'll meet you in three days' time, after the sun sets.

399
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,484
河边有个空地，我在哪里等你
There's a clearing by the river. I'll meet you there.

400
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:03,422
- 不成功呢？- 我会在空地等你
And if it doesn't? I will meet you at the clearing.

00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:23,412
靠墙站好！

Be brave, human.

你知道你有什么问题吗？
TANNIS: You know what your problem is?

406
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:47,433
你不明白大自然的法则
You don't understand the natural order of things.

凡事都会变
Things change.

那你可要准备好了
Be ready when they do.

你不明白这是我给你的礼物？
Do you not realize this is a gift I am giving you?

413

这是诅咒！
RAZE: It's a curse.

- 它们？对我们做了什么- 你很快就会知道的
What have they done to us? You'll find out soon enough.

415
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,186
他们们把我们变成…你们
They turned us into... Like you?

对
Yes.

为什么？
Why?

He wants to use you for his own protection.

419

我会先死
I will die first.

那可能不会发生
