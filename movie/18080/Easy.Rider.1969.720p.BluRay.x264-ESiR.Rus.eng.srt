1
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,177
<i>You know, I smoked a lot of grass</i>

2
00:05:30,244 --> 00:05:33,975
<i>Oh, Lord, I popped a lot of pills</i>

3
00:05:39,854 --> 00:05:42,789
<i>But I've never touched nothin'</i>

4
00:05:45,226 --> 00:05:48,389
<i>That my spirit could kill</i>

5
00:05:51,165 --> 00:05:54,157
<i>You know, I've seen</i> <i>a lot of people walkin' 'round</i>

6
00:05:54,235 --> 00:05:57,170
<i>With tombstones in their eyes</i>

7
00:06:04,378 --> 00:06:06,403
<i>But the pusher don't care</i>

8
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,244
<i>If you live or if you die</i>

9
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,017
<i>God damn</i>

10
00:06:20,428 --> 00:06:22,362
<i>The pusher</i>

11
00:06:27,401 --> 00:06:30,131
<i>God damn</i>

12
00:06:30,204 --> 00:06:33,367
<i>Hey, hey, I say the pusher</i>

13
00:06:39,013 --> 00:06:41,982
<i>I said, God damn</i>

14
00:06:42,049 --> 00:06:45,143
<i>God damn the pusher man</i>

15
00:07:42,109 --> 00:07:44,043
<i>Get your motor runnin'</i>

16
00:07:45,413 --> 00:07:47,313
<i>Head out on the highway</i>

17
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:51,218
<i>Lookin' for adventure</i>

18
00:07:51,285 --> 00:07:54,254
<i>And whatever comes our way</i>

19
00:07:55,156 --> 00:07:58,353
<i>Yeah, darlin'</i> <i>Gonna make it happen</i>

20
00:07:58,426 --> 00:08:01,827
<i>Take the world in a love embrace</i>

21
00:08:01,896 --> 00:08:05,093
<i>Fire all of the guns at once and</i>

22
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,964
<i>Explode info space</i>

23
00:08:08,035 --> 00:08:10,367
<i>I like smoke and lightnin'</i>

24
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:13,532
<i>Heavy metal thunder</i>

25
00:08:14,608 --> 00:08:18,009
<i>Racin' with the wind</i>

26
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:21,412
<i>And the feelin' that I'm under</i>

27
00:08:21,482 --> 00:08:24,849
<i>Yeah, darlin'</i> <i>Gonna make it happen</i>

28
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:28,184
<i>Take the world in a love embrace</i>

29
00:08:28,255 --> 00:08:31,486
<i>Fire all of the guns at once and</i>

30
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:33,584
<i>Explode info space</i>

31
00:08:33,661 --> 00:08:36,926
<i>Like a true nature's child</i>

32
00:08:36,998 --> 00:08:40,365
<i>We were born, born to be wild</i>

33
00:08:40,434 --> 00:08:42,732
<i>We can climb so high</i>

34
00:08:42,803 --> 00:08:46,569
<i>And never wanna die</i>

35
00:08:47,641 --> 00:08:51,099
<i>Born to be wild</i>

36
00:08:54,382 --> 00:08:57,783
<i>Born to be wild</i>

37
00:09:37,058 --> 00:09:38,992
Hey, you got a room?

38
00:09:42,396 --> 00:09:43,988
Hey, man!

39
00:09:47,034 --> 00:09:48,467
You got a room?

40
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,017
You asshole!

41
00:10:12,026 --> 00:10:16,463
<i>I'm goin' down to Mardi Gras</i> <i>I'm gonna get me a Mardi Gras queen</i>

42
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,590
Oh, man. Wow, Mardi Gras, man.

43
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:22,067
That's gonna be the weirdest, man.

44
00:10:23,804 --> 00:10:26,500
You know what we ought to do first thing, man?

45
00:10:26,574 --> 00:10:29,202
Go and get us a groovy dinner.

46
00:10:29,276 --> 00:10:31,870
Break out some of that cash, man.

47
00:10:38,152 --> 00:10:42,418
Out here in the wilderness, fighting Indians and cowboys on every side.

48
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,257
What's the matter? You zonked? You really zoaned?

49
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:52,060
No, I'm just kinda tired, man.

50
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:54,067
Oh, man, you're pulling inside.

51
00:10:54,135 --> 00:10:56,194
You're getting a little distance tonight.

52
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,704
You're getting a little distance, baby.

53
00:10:58,772 --> 00:11:00,137
Yeah.

54
00:11:00,207 --> 00:11:03,574
Well, I'm just getting my thing together.

55
00:11:03,644 --> 00:11:05,077
Yeah, right.

56
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,271
Come on. It's check-out time.

57
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,436
Hey. Billy.

58
00:12:11,512 --> 00:12:13,446
Oh, man, don't do that.

59
00:12:57,725 --> 00:12:59,317
Howdy.

60
00:13:00,894 --> 00:13:02,885
What can I do for you?

61
00:13:02,963 --> 00:13:06,399
I'd like to fix my flat, if you don't mind.

62
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:08,332
No, I don't mind.

63
00:13:08,402 --> 00:13:11,565
Just get in the barn. You'll find the tools you'll need.

64
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,573
Whoa, baby. Whoa, honey.

65
00:13:15,342 --> 00:13:18,277
Turn that thing off. You're making my horse skittish.

66
00:13:25,686 --> 00:13:27,813
That sure is a good-looking machine.

67
00:13:27,888 --> 00:13:29,321
Yeah.

68
00:13:57,785 --> 00:13:59,377
There you go.

69
00:14:07,394 --> 00:14:09,919
You fellas can sit down here.

70
00:14:20,607 --> 00:14:23,041
Would you mind taking off your hat?

71
00:14:35,656 --> 00:14:38,591
We thank Thee, O Lord, for these, Thy gifts...

72
00:14:38,659 --> 00:14:40,286
received from Thy bounty...

73
00:14:40,361 --> 00:14:44,821
in the name of Thy only begotten son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.

74
00:14:44,898 --> 00:14:46,331
Amen.

75
00:14:58,812 --> 00:15:00,404
Where you fellas from?

76
00:15:01,615 --> 00:15:03,048
L.A.

77
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,214
Los Angeles.

78
00:15:07,287 --> 00:15:09,721
Los Angeles. Is that a fact?

79
00:15:10,991 --> 00:15:12,583
When I was young...

80
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:16,595
I was headed for California, but...

81
00:15:16,663 --> 00:15:19,097
Well, you know how it is.

82
00:15:27,274 --> 00:15:30,209
Well, you sure got a nice spread here.

83
00:15:31,345 --> 00:15:33,836
Sure got a lot of 'em.

84
00:15:33,914 --> 00:15:36,007
My wife is Catholic, you know.

85
00:15:40,888 --> 00:15:42,822
Honey, could we have some more coffee?

86
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,688
No, I mean it. You've got a nice place.

87
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:56,702
It's not every man that can live off the land.

88
00:15:58,138 --> 00:16:02,074
You do your own thing in your own time. You should be proud.

89
00:16:09,883 --> 00:16:12,249
<i>Well, I'd rather go and journey</i>

90
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:15,083
<i>Where the diamond crescent's glowing</i>

91
00:16:15,155 --> 00:16:17,555
<i>And run across the valley</i>

92
00:16:17,624 --> 00:16:20,092
<i>Beneath the sacred mountain</i>

93
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,561
<i>And wander through the forest</i>

94
00:16:24,965 --> 00:16:27,934
<i>Where the frees have leaves of prisms</i>

95
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:30,435
<i>And break the light in colors</i>

96
00:16:30,504 --> 00:16:33,496
<i>That no one knows the names of</i>

97
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,435
<i>And when if's time I'll go and waif</i>

98
00:16:39,513 --> 00:16:42,380
<i>Beside a legendary fountain</i>

99
00:16:42,449 --> 00:16:44,280
<i>Till I see the form reflected</i>

100
00:16:44,351 --> 00:16:47,218
<i>In its clear and jeweled waters</i>

101
00:16:47,287 --> 00:16:50,256
<i>And if you think I'm ready</i>

102
00:16:52,025 --> 00:16:54,858
<i>You may lead me to the chasm</i>

103
00:16:54,928 --> 00:16:57,419
<i>Where the rivers of our vision</i>

104
00:16:57,498 --> 00:17:00,661
<i>Flow info one another</i>

105
00:17:30,297 --> 00:17:32,492
<i>I will want to dive beneath</i>

106
00:17:32,566 --> 00:17:34,727
<i>The white cascading waters</i>

107
00:17:34,801 --> 00:17:37,167
<i>She may beg, she may plead</i>

108
00:17:37,237 --> 00:17:40,172
<i>She may argue with her logic</i>

109
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,676
<i>And mention all the things I learned</i>

110
00:17:45,312 --> 00:17:47,837
<i>That really have no value</i>

111
00:17:47,915 --> 00:17:50,645
<i>In the end she will surely know</i>

112
00:17:50,717 --> 00:17:53,652
<i>I wasn't born to follow</i>

113
00:18:37,831 --> 00:18:39,765
Hey, man, what are you doing?

114
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:44,503
I gotta talk to you, man.

115
00:18:50,243 --> 00:18:53,178
Everything we ever dreamed of is in that teardrop gas tank...

116
00:18:53,246 --> 00:18:56,181
and you got a stranger over there pouring gasoline all over it.

117
00:18:56,249 --> 00:18:59,184
All he's gotta do is look into it and he can see that...

118
00:18:59,252 --> 00:19:01,618
He won't know what it is, man.

119
00:19:01,688 --> 00:19:04,350
Don't worry, Billy. Everything's all right.

120
00:19:04,424 --> 00:19:06,858
All right, all right. I don't know, man.

121
00:19:06,927 --> 00:19:09,157
I do.

122
00:19:09,229 --> 00:19:11,163
Everything's fine, Billy.

123
00:19:24,211 --> 00:19:26,805
- Well... - That's all taken care of.

124
00:19:28,115 --> 00:19:30,174
I like that.

125
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,902
<i>I pulled in to Nazareth</i>

126
00:19:55,976 --> 00:19:58,843
<i>Was feelin' 'bout half past dead</i>

127
00:19:59,913 --> 00:20:02,313
<i>I just need some place</i>

128
00:20:02,382 --> 00:20:06,648
<i>Where I can lay my head</i>

129
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,018
<i>Hey, mister, can you tell me</i>

130
00:20:09,089 --> 00:20:11,717
<i>Where a man might find a bed</i>

131
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,227
<i>He just grinned and shook my hand</i>

132
00:20:16,296 --> 00:20:18,230
<i>"No" was all he said</i>

133
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,925
<i>Take a load off, Fanny</i>

134
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,400
<i>Take a load for free</i>

135
00:20:26,606 --> 00:20:28,631
<i>Take a load off, Fanny</i>

136
00:20:30,377 --> 00:20:32,845
<i>And</i>

137
00:20:32,913 --> 00:20:36,747
<i>You put the load right on me</i>

138
00:20:42,556 --> 00:20:44,490
<i>I picked up my bag</i>

139
00:20:45,225 --> 00:20:48,058
<i>I went lookin' for a place to hide</i>

140
00:20:49,129 --> 00:20:52,223
<i>Then I saw old Carmen</i> <i>and the devil</i>

141
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:54,733
<i>Walkin' side by side</i>

142
00:20:56,436 --> 00:20:58,666
<i>I said, Hey, Carmen</i>

143
00:20:58,739 --> 00:21:01,139
<i>Come on, let's go downtown</i>

144
00:21:02,743 --> 00:21:05,109
<i>She said, I gotta go</i>

145
00:21:05,178 --> 00:21:08,113
<i>But my friend can stick around</i>

146
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,680
<i>Take a load off, Fanny</i>

147
00:21:12,753 --> 00:21:14,846
<i>Take a load for free</i>

148
00:21:16,156 --> 00:21:18,124
<i>Take a load off, Fanny</i>

149
00:21:19,926 --> 00:21:22,326
<i>And</i>

150
00:21:22,395 --> 00:21:24,989
<i>You put the load right on me</i>

151
00:21:32,272 --> 00:21:33,864
<i>Yeah</i>

152
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,135
<i>Take a load off, Fanny</i>

153
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,335
<i>Take a load for free</i>

154
00:21:40,614 --> 00:21:42,809
<i>Take a load off, Fanny</i>

155
00:21:44,384 --> 00:21:46,818
<i>And</i>

156
00:21:46,887 --> 00:21:50,823
<i>You put the load right on me</i>

157
00:22:59,659 --> 00:23:02,594
- How much further we gotta go, man? - I don't know.

158
00:23:04,197 --> 00:23:05,630
Not much further.

159
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,369
That's what you said this morning.

160
00:23:10,437 --> 00:23:13,372
I sometimes say it all day.

161
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,374
Really? You say it all day, huh?

162
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:19,907
We don't have much longer. We'll be there soon.

163
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,245
We gotta get to Mardi Gras, man. We're going to Mardi Gras.

164
00:23:23,316 --> 00:23:25,978
Little heart is set on that, huh?

165
00:23:26,052 --> 00:23:27,713
We got a week.

166
00:23:27,787 --> 00:23:29,846
That's a week away, man.

167
00:23:30,957 --> 00:23:33,517
It's a long way to Mardi Gras, baby.

168
00:23:34,728 --> 00:23:37,720
It won't take us a week to get to New Orleans.

169
00:23:45,872 --> 00:23:48,306
Wow.

170
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:50,741
I think I'm gonna crash.

171
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:52,744
I think you have crashed, man.

172
00:24:04,724 --> 00:24:07,659
I keep seeing things jumping all over the place.

173
00:24:08,795 --> 00:24:10,729
- Really? - Yeah, look.

174
00:24:11,998 --> 00:24:13,932
- What is it? - It's a moth.

175
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,628
- A what? - Moth.

176
00:24:16,703 --> 00:24:18,136
Bug.

177
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:26,001
It's a weird place, man.

178
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:29,242
Oh, man. That smoke's getting to me.

179
00:24:31,952 --> 00:24:33,886
But I notice you're not moving.

180
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,894
Where you from, man?

181
00:24:43,396 --> 00:24:45,557
Can I have a light?

182
00:24:45,632 --> 00:24:47,566
Where you from, man?

183
00:24:50,537 --> 00:24:52,129
Hard to say.

184
00:24:52,205 --> 00:24:55,606
"Hard to say"? Where you from, man?

185
00:24:55,675 --> 00:24:59,509
It's hard to say because it's a very long word, you know.

186
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,214
I just wanna know where you're from, man.

187
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:07,950
A city.

188
00:25:08,021 --> 00:25:09,454
What city?

189
00:25:11,324 --> 00:25:14,259
Doesn't make any difference what city. All cities are alike.

190
00:25:14,327 --> 00:25:16,261
That's why I'm out here now.

191
00:25:16,329 --> 00:25:19,162
Why you're out here now? Why?

192
00:25:20,467 --> 00:25:25,495
'Cause I'm a long way from the city, and that's where I wanna be right now.

193
00:25:28,575 --> 00:25:30,509
They know you in this place?

194
00:25:33,013 --> 00:25:35,607
This place we're coming to?

195
00:25:35,682 --> 00:25:37,616
Or the place we're at now?

196
00:25:39,185 --> 00:25:40,777
This place.

197
00:25:47,193 --> 00:25:49,127
You're right on top of 'em.

198
00:25:49,195 --> 00:25:52,096
- I'm right on top of 'em? - Yeah.

199
00:25:52,165 --> 00:25:55,430
The people this place belongs to are buried right under you.

200
00:25:58,171 --> 00:26:01,402
You could be a trifle polite.

201
00:26:01,474 --> 00:26:03,066
"A trifle polite"?

202
00:26:05,145 --> 00:26:07,079
A small thing to ask.

203
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:19,415
You ever want to be somebody else?

204
00:26:22,262 --> 00:26:24,696
I'd like to try Porky Pig.

205
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:33,805
I never wanted to be anybody else.

206
00:28:34,427 --> 00:28:37,362
You can't hit me! I'm invisible! I'm invisible!

207
00:28:44,103 --> 00:28:46,298
Hey, Sarah.

208
00:28:46,372 --> 00:28:48,306
How's it going?

209
00:28:55,448 --> 00:28:57,382
Rudolph, what are you eating?

210
00:28:59,652 --> 00:29:03,418
- Thanks for the stuff you brought. - How's it going?

211
00:29:03,489 --> 00:29:07,687
We just can't take any more strangers. Just too many people dropping in.

212
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,786
I'm not talking about you and your friends... you know that.

213
00:29:12,332 --> 00:29:16,496
The week before, Susan dropped in with 12 people from Easter City.

214
00:29:16,569 --> 00:29:20,096
She wanted to take ten pounds of rice with her.

215
00:29:20,173 --> 00:29:21,765
Naturally we had to say no...

216
00:29:21,841 --> 00:29:25,709
so she gets all uptight, breaks out some hash and won't give us any.

217
00:29:25,778 --> 00:29:29,976
That's not all. The next morning they couldn't get their bus started.

218
00:29:30,049 --> 00:29:34,042
Sarah, I bet you haven't had anybody like me around to rap to, have you?

219
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,350
I don't have to tell you how it is, Sarah.

220
00:29:36,422 --> 00:29:38,356
I love you, and I want you to rap.

221
00:29:38,424 --> 00:29:40,688
- Oh, God, I want you to rap, rap, rap. - Cut that out!

222
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:46,130
I guess nobody else here is interested, but I'd sure like to meet your friend.

223
00:29:46,199 --> 00:29:49,396
I bet you'd like to do more than that.

224
00:29:49,469 --> 00:29:51,403
I think he's beautiful.

225
00:29:51,471 --> 00:29:53,302
He's beautiful.

226
00:29:53,373 --> 00:29:56,365
What is that weird thing up there on the hill, man?

227
00:29:56,442 --> 00:29:59,377
It looks like a stage. You got light opera coming here or something?

228
00:29:59,445 --> 00:30:01,208
That's the mime troupe's stage.

229
00:30:01,281 --> 00:30:03,647
They've gone down to the hot springs to bathe.

230
00:30:03,716 --> 00:30:05,445
Mime troupe?

231
00:30:07,787 --> 00:30:11,848
Hey, Lisa. What does this mean?

232
00:30:11,924 --> 00:30:15,883
"Starting brings misfortune.

233
00:30:15,962 --> 00:30:18,897
Perseverance brings danger.

234
00:30:18,965 --> 00:30:23,561
Not every demand for change in the existing order should be heeded.

235
00:30:23,636 --> 00:30:27,572
On the other hand, repeated and well-founded complaints...

236
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,733
should not fail to a hearing."

237
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:33,738
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye!

238
00:30:33,813 --> 00:30:38,182
We've come to play for our dinner.

239
00:30:38,251 --> 00:30:41,880
Or should I say, stay for our dinner?

240
00:30:41,954 --> 00:30:44,286
Or even...

241
00:30:44,357 --> 00:30:46,552
slay for our dinner!

242
00:30:46,626 --> 00:30:49,789
Oh! Men at war. How ghastly.

243
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:53,826
We've come to drink your wine...

244
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:58,064
taste your food and take pleasure in your women.

245
00:30:58,137 --> 00:31:01,072
The water in that river is about 80 degrees.

246
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:04,268
You put your hand in about a foot away, it's below freezing.

247
00:31:04,344 --> 00:31:07,438
- Come on! I've got to get dinner on! - What's this I hear?

248
00:31:07,513 --> 00:31:09,447
Who said "out" to me?

249
00:31:09,515 --> 00:31:11,949
Pardon me! I've played communes all...

250
00:31:12,018 --> 00:31:14,646
Out! Out! Out!

251
00:31:14,721 --> 00:31:18,316
The evil eye on this place! A double whammy for all of you!

252
00:31:18,391 --> 00:31:21,986
- When you lie with dogs, you get fleas. - Come, my dear.

253
00:31:22,061 --> 00:31:23,756
We won't play here.

254
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,263
Wow. Wow. Wow.

255
00:31:29,302 --> 00:31:30,894
Get out.

256
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,403
I like you.

257
00:31:41,314 --> 00:31:44,408
What happened here is, these people got here late in the summer.

258
00:31:44,484 --> 00:31:45,974
Too late to plant.

259
00:31:46,052 --> 00:31:49,351
But the weather was beautiful, it was easy living, everything was fine.

260
00:31:49,422 --> 00:31:51,014
Then came that winter.

261
00:31:51,657 --> 00:31:54,888
Forty or fifty of them living in this one-room place down here.

262
00:31:54,961 --> 00:31:59,830
Nothing to eat. Starving. Out by the road looking for dead horses.

263
00:31:59,899 --> 00:32:01,890
Anything they could get ahold of.

264
00:32:01,968 --> 00:32:05,563
There's 18 or 20 of them left, and they're city kids... look at them.

265
00:32:11,277 --> 00:32:13,211
But they're getting this crop in...

266
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,715
and they're gonna stay here till it's harvested.

267
00:32:24,757 --> 00:32:27,351
Do you get much rain here, man?

268
00:32:27,427 --> 00:32:30,362
I guess we're gonna have to dance for that.

269
00:32:43,576 --> 00:32:46,409
Look at this, man. A seashell, man.

270
00:32:46,479 --> 00:32:47,912
See that?

271
00:32:51,017 --> 00:32:54,350
This is nothing but sand. They ain't gonna grow anything here.

272
00:32:55,254 --> 00:32:57,518
They're gonna make it.

273
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,182
Dig, man.

274
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:02,050
They're gonna make it.

275
00:34:37,089 --> 00:34:39,023
We have planted our seeds.

276
00:34:42,595 --> 00:34:44,187
We ask...

277
00:34:45,531 --> 00:34:47,465
that our efforts be worthy...

278
00:34:48,935 --> 00:34:51,130
to produce simple food...

279
00:34:52,605 --> 00:34:54,539
for our simple taste.

280
00:34:57,677 --> 00:34:59,611
We ask that our efforts...

281
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,714
be rewarded.

282
00:35:07,019 --> 00:35:10,455
We thank You for the food we eat from other hands...

283
00:35:15,628 --> 00:35:18,563
that we may share it with our fellow man...

284
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,926
and be even more generous...

285
00:35:24,003 --> 00:35:26,437
when it is from our own.

286
00:35:32,111 --> 00:35:34,045
Thank You for a place...

287
00:35:35,381 --> 00:35:37,315
to make a stand.

288
00:35:45,491 --> 00:35:47,584
Amen.

289
00:35:51,063 --> 00:35:52,553
Let's eat.

290
00:35:57,203 --> 00:36:00,297
Ah, hark, ye gentles! Hark, ye all!

291
00:36:00,373 --> 00:36:03,308
The time has come for a curtain call.

292
00:36:08,214 --> 00:36:10,978
<i>How do you wear your hair</i> <i>Does your hair hang low</i>

293
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:13,416
<i>Do you tie if in a ribbon</i> <i>Do you tie if in a bow</i>

294
00:36:13,486 --> 00:36:16,011
<i>Do you wear it over your shoulder</i> <i>like a Continental soldier</i>

295
00:36:16,088 --> 00:36:18,852
<i>Does your hair hang low</i>

296
00:36:46,218 --> 00:36:48,152
Are you an Aquarius?

297
00:36:58,698 --> 00:37:00,131
Pisces?

298
00:37:11,277 --> 00:37:13,211
I guessed right.

299
00:37:18,417 --> 00:37:20,351
Do you like our place here?

300
00:37:23,923 --> 00:37:25,356
Yeah.

301
00:37:25,424 --> 00:37:27,187
<i>We will kill the old red rooster</i>

302
00:37:27,259 --> 00:37:30,990
<i>We will kill the old red rooster</i> <i>when she comes</i>

303
00:37:31,063 --> 00:37:34,726
<i>We'll all go to greet her</i> <i>when she comes</i>

304
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,065
<i>We will all have chicken and dumplings</i> <i>when she comes</i>

305
00:38:02,294 --> 00:38:03,886
Who sent you?

306
00:38:11,303 --> 00:38:12,463
<i>Does your hair hang low</i>

307
00:38:12,538 --> 00:38:14,904
<i>Do you tie if in a ribbon</i> <i>Do you tie if in a bow</i>

308
00:38:14,974 --> 00:38:17,499

309
00:38:17,576 --> 00:38:20,340
<i>Does your hair hang low</i>

310
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:35,684
Look, I gotta get out of here, man.

311
00:38:36,896 --> 00:38:39,160
We got things we wanna do, man.

312
00:38:40,399 --> 00:38:42,560
I gotta get out of here, man.

313
00:38:44,236 --> 00:38:48,798
Could you take me and my friend over across the canyon?

314
00:38:48,874 --> 00:38:50,307
Yeah, anything.

315
00:38:51,377 --> 00:38:54,312
It won't be out of your way. Honest.

316
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,314
It's all right.

317
00:39:00,986 --> 00:39:04,820
We're not no travelin' bureau. Why don't they get their own ride?

318
00:39:05,925 --> 00:39:07,859
We're eating their food.

319
00:39:12,431 --> 00:39:14,023
All right.

320
00:39:22,641 --> 00:39:25,075
- Get 'em together, though, man. - Right.

321
00:40:14,593 --> 00:40:17,619
More water! More water!

322
00:40:21,867 --> 00:40:24,427
<i>Well, I'd rather go and journey</i>

323
00:40:24,503 --> 00:40:27,267
<i>Where the diamond crescent's glowing</i>

324
00:40:27,339 --> 00:40:29,773
<i>And run across the valley</i>

325
00:40:29,842 --> 00:40:32,276
<i>Beneath the sacred mountain</i>

326
00:40:32,344 --> 00:40:35,541
<i>And wander through the forest</i>

327
00:40:37,216 --> 00:40:40,049
<i>Where the frees have leaves of prisms</i>

328
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:42,610
<i>And break the light in colors</i>

329
00:40:42,688 --> 00:40:45,486
<i>That no one knows the names of</i>

330
00:40:49,161 --> 00:40:51,595
<i>And when if's time I'll go and waif</i>

331
00:40:51,664 --> 00:40:54,565
<i>Beside a legendary fountain</i>

332
00:40:54,633 --> 00:40:57,124
<i>Till I see the form reflected</i>

333
00:40:57,202 --> 00:40:59,534
<i>In its clear and jeweled waters</i>

334
00:40:59,605 --> 00:41:02,005
<i>And if you think I'm ready</i>

335
00:41:03,876 --> 00:41:07,107
<i>You may lead me to the chasm</i>

336
00:41:07,179 --> 00:41:09,579
<i>Where the rivers of our vision</i>

337
00:41:09,648 --> 00:41:13,049
<i>Flow info one another</i>

338
00:41:42,548 --> 00:41:44,982
<i>I will want to dive beneath</i>

339
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,984
<i>The white cascading wafers</i>

340
00:41:47,052 --> 00:41:49,452
<i>She may beg, she may plead</i>

341
00:41:49,521 --> 00:41:52,319
<i>She may argue with her logic</i>

342
00:41:52,391 --> 00:41:55,451
<i>And mention all the things I learned</i>

343
00:41:57,529 --> 00:42:00,225
<i>That really have no value</i>

344
00:42:00,299 --> 00:42:02,665
<i>In the end, she will surely know</i>

345
00:42:02,735 --> 00:42:05,670
<i>I wasn't born to follow</i>

346
00:42:30,929 --> 00:42:34,660
When you get to the right place with the right people...

347
00:42:34,733 --> 00:42:36,667
quarter this.

348
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:41,765
You know, this could be the right place.

349
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,774
Your time's running out.

350
00:42:46,345 --> 00:42:48,472
If we're going, let's go!

351
00:42:53,786 --> 00:42:55,515
Yeah.

352
00:42:58,257 --> 00:43:00,191
I'm hip about time.

353
00:43:03,529 --> 00:43:04,962
But I gotta go.

354
00:44:12,264 --> 00:44:14,698
"Parading without a permit"? You gotta be kidding!

355
00:44:14,766 --> 00:44:18,202
Do you know who this is? This is Captain America! I'm Billy!

356
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:20,534
Hey, we're headliners, baby!

357
00:44:20,606 --> 00:44:24,542
We played every fair in this part of the country, and for top dollar too!

358
00:44:52,889 --> 00:44:56,325
Weirdo hicks, man. A bunch of weirdo hicks.

359
00:44:58,228 --> 00:45:00,458
"Parading without a permit"! Man!

360
00:45:25,288 --> 00:45:27,950
Oh, no. What did I do now?

361
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:35,564
Oh, what am I gonna do now?

362
00:45:38,568 --> 00:45:40,502
Oh, my head.

363
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:46,571
All right, George, what are you gonna do now?

364
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:49,339
I mean, you promised these people.

365
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:53,382
You promised these people.

366
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:55,884
They ain't gonna believe you, George.

367
00:45:57,821 --> 00:46:00,881
Hey, man, would you mind? You just woke my friend up.

368
00:46:00,957 --> 00:46:03,050
Oh. Yeah, well...

369
00:46:05,061 --> 00:46:07,689
I'm real sorry. I didn't realize.

370
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:11,300
I didn't realize.

371
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:18,807
My head.

372
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:24,473
If you don't shut your mouth, you ain't gonna have a head.

373
00:46:41,898 --> 00:46:46,062
I see you're up, Mr. Hanson. You'll feel a lot better after this.

374
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,467
Oh.

375
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,032
Thank you, Bob.

376
00:46:55,879 --> 00:46:59,406
I guess I really tied one on last night.

377
00:46:59,482 --> 00:47:02,417
Must have had a hell of a good time.

378
00:47:03,219 --> 00:47:05,813
Wish I could remember it.

379
00:47:09,058 --> 00:47:12,653
Hey, man, you don't think you could get me a cigarette, do you?

380
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:15,664
You animals ain't smart enough to play with fire.

381
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:18,326
Oh, no, that's all right, Bob. They're good boys.

382
00:47:18,401 --> 00:47:20,335
You can give them a cigarette.

383
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,173
Thanks, mister.

384
00:47:28,578 --> 00:47:30,512
- You got a match? - Yeah.

385
00:47:33,216 --> 00:47:34,808
Thank you, Bob.

386
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:46,694
I'm sorry about, you know, the misunderstanding.

387
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:49,698
Oh, that's all right. There was no misunderstanding.

388
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:52,360
We're all in the same cage here.

389
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:58,302
You must be some important dude, man, to get that treatment.

390
00:47:58,374 --> 00:48:00,365
"Dude"?

391
00:48:00,443 --> 00:48:03,378
What does he mean, "dude"? Dude ranch?

392
00:48:06,683 --> 00:48:08,844
"Dude" means...

393
00:48:08,918 --> 00:48:11,011
a nice guy.

394
00:48:11,087 --> 00:48:13,021
A regular sort of person.

395
00:48:13,089 --> 00:48:17,150
Well, you boys don't look like you're from this part of the country.

396
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:20,685
You're lucky I'm here to see that you don't get into anything.

397
00:48:20,763 --> 00:48:22,697
"Anything"?

398
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:26,700
They got this here...

399
00:48:26,769 --> 00:48:30,205
scissor-happy, "beautify America" thing going on around here.

400
00:48:30,273 --> 00:48:33,208
They're trying to make everybody look like Yul Brynner.

401
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:36,606
They used rusty razor blades...

402
00:48:36,679 --> 00:48:39,614
on the last two longhairs they brought in here...

403
00:48:39,682 --> 00:48:41,673
and I wasn't here to protect 'em.

404
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:49,891
I'm a lawyer. Done a lot of work for the ACLU.

405
00:48:49,959 --> 00:48:51,893
"George Hanson."

406
00:48:54,697 --> 00:48:57,860
You think you can help us get out of here with no sweat?

407
00:48:59,168 --> 00:49:03,104
I imagine that I can, if you haven't killed anybody.

408
00:49:04,173 --> 00:49:06,107
At least nobody white.

409
00:49:10,613 --> 00:49:15,312
See there? Twenty-five dollars. And no razor blades.

410
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:17,319
Very groovy, George. Thank you.

411
00:49:17,387 --> 00:49:21,653
"Very groovy." See there? I'll bet nobody ever said that to you.

412
00:49:21,724 --> 00:49:24,921
Oh, by the way, Bob, thanks for the aspirin before.

413
00:49:24,994 --> 00:49:29,897
George, I'm gettin' to think you're a regular regular around here.

414
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:33,231
I'm not gonna tell your dad.

415
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,931
You just gotta be more careful.

416
00:49:36,005 --> 00:49:41,409
Well, Pat, that'd be real good if the powers that be wouldn't hear about this.

417
00:49:41,477 --> 00:49:45,208
I mean, the old man hasn't been feeling too good. You know what I mean?

418
00:49:45,281 --> 00:49:50,651
Well, now, George, you know we won't tell your dad about that.

419
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,154
- Isn't that right, Bob? - Right.

420
00:49:53,222 --> 00:49:54,712
Well...

421
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:57,726
what do you say we take a look at these super machines...

422
00:49:57,794 --> 00:49:59,728
we've been hearing so much about?

423
00:49:59,796 --> 00:50:01,627
Let's get it on.

424
00:50:01,698 --> 00:50:04,633
- Thanks a lot, Bob. - Sure. See you later.

425
00:50:09,739 --> 00:50:12,674
I'll take care of it later.

426
00:50:15,244 --> 00:50:16,836
All right, Carl.

427
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:20,416
Thanks a million. Say hello to the missus for me.

428
00:50:23,953 --> 00:50:27,184
Here's the first of the day, fellas.

429
00:50:29,025 --> 00:50:31,459
To old D.H. Lawrence.

430
00:50:43,806 --> 00:50:45,239
Indians!

431
00:50:56,452 --> 00:50:57,885
Thank you.

432
00:50:59,555 --> 00:51:00,988
You know...

433
00:51:02,191 --> 00:51:04,921
I must have started off to Mardi Gras...

434
00:51:04,994 --> 00:51:06,757
six or seven times.

435
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:10,799
Never got further than the state line.

436
00:51:12,435 --> 00:51:14,869
Governor of Louisiana give me this.

437
00:51:16,272 --> 00:51:18,866
"Madame Tinkertoy's House of Blue Lights.

438
00:51:18,941 --> 00:51:22,433
Corner of Bourbon and Toulouse, New Orleans, Louisiana."

439
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:27,245
Now, this is supposed to be the finest whorehouse in the South.

440
00:51:27,316 --> 00:51:32,481
These ain't no pork chops. These are U.S. Prime.

441
00:51:32,555 --> 00:51:34,250
Out of sight, man.

442
00:51:34,323 --> 00:51:36,985
Oh, I'd like to get over there.

443
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:43,929
How long did you boys say it was gonna take you to get down there?

444
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,436
- About two or three days. - Two or three days? Is that right?

445
00:51:48,871 --> 00:51:51,806
Oh, boy, I sure wish I was going with you.

446
00:51:51,874 --> 00:51:53,307
Yeah?

447
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,469
You got a helmet?

448
00:51:59,248 --> 00:52:01,182
Oh, I've got a helmet.

449
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:03,785
I got a beauty!

450
00:54:34,737 --> 00:54:38,571
Well, old buddy, I never thought I'd ever see you again.

451
00:54:41,143 --> 00:54:44,112
You know I threw this thing away one week ago.

452
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:49,642
My mother, of all people, retrieved it. I can't understand that.

453
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:52,051
She didn't even want me to play football.

454
00:54:52,121 --> 00:54:54,954
Always afraid I was gonna get hurt.

455
00:54:55,024 --> 00:54:58,391
And 12 years later, I find it on my pillow...

456
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:00,793
with a note pinned next to it saying...

457
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:02,888
"Save this for your son."

458
00:55:11,307 --> 00:55:12,501
Fire.

459
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:16,334
Do this instead.

460
00:55:18,447 --> 00:55:21,848
Oh, no, thanks. I got some store-bought right over here of my own.

461
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:25,012
No, man, this is grass.

462
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:28,517
You mean marijuana?

463
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:29,853
Yeah.

464
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:35,862
Lord, have mercy. Is that what that is?

465
00:55:40,469 --> 00:55:42,403
Let me see that.

466
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:47,876
Marijuana, hmm.

467
00:55:52,715 --> 00:55:53,977
Light it up.

468
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:57,986
Oh, no, no. I couldn't do that.

469
00:55:58,054 --> 00:56:02,150
I mean, I've got enough problems with the booze and all.

470
00:56:02,224 --> 00:56:04,988
I mean, I can't afford to get hooked.

471
00:56:07,263 --> 00:56:08,662
You won't get hooked.

472
00:56:08,731 --> 00:56:13,191
Yeah, well, I know, but it leads to harder stuff.

473
00:56:21,043 --> 00:56:24,843
Except y-you say it's all right?

474
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:32,811
Well, all right, then.

475
00:56:32,888 --> 00:56:35,448
H-How do I do it?

476
00:56:35,524 --> 00:56:36,855
Here.

477
00:56:59,148 --> 00:57:02,208
That's got a real nice taste to it.

478
00:57:02,284 --> 00:57:04,844
Though I don't suppose it'll do me much good.

479
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:08,048
I mean, I'm so used to the booze and everything.

480
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:11,150
You've got to hold it in your lungs longer, George.

481
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:24,269
Oh, wow!

482
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:28,572
What... was that, man?

483
00:57:28,644 --> 00:57:30,635
What the hell was that, man?

484
00:57:30,713 --> 00:57:32,305
Huh?

485
00:57:32,381 --> 00:57:36,044
No... Hey, man, wow. I was watching this object.

486
00:57:36,118 --> 00:57:38,348
Like the satellite that we saw the other night.

487
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:40,981
It was going right across the sky, and then...

488
00:57:42,191 --> 00:57:44,751
I mean, it just suddenly...

489
00:57:44,827 --> 00:57:49,287
It just changed direction and went whizzing right off, man.

490
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:51,424
- It flashed... - You're stoned out of your mind.

491
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,934
Yeah, like, I'm stoned, you know, man...

492
00:57:54,003 --> 00:57:57,200
but I saw a satellite, man...

493
00:57:57,273 --> 00:57:59,935
and it was going across the sky...

494
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:02,477
and it flashed three times at me...

495
00:58:02,545 --> 00:58:04,979
and zigzagged and whizzed off, man.

496
00:58:05,047 --> 00:58:06,981
And I saw it.

497
00:58:09,118 --> 00:58:12,918
That was a UFO beamin' back at you.

498
00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:18,223
Me and Eric was down in Mexico two weeks ago.

499
00:58:18,294 --> 00:58:21,923
We seen 40 of 'em flyin' in formation.

500
00:58:21,997 --> 00:58:25,364
They have got bases all over the world now.

501
00:58:25,434 --> 00:58:28,767
They been comin' here ever since 1946...

502
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:33,138
when the scientists first started bouncin' radar beams off of the moon...

503
00:58:33,209 --> 00:58:37,236
and they have been livin' and workin' among us in vast quantities ever since.

504
00:58:37,313 --> 00:58:40,077
The government knows all about 'em.

505
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:42,583
What are you talkin', man?

506
00:58:43,486 --> 00:58:46,011
You just seen one of 'em, didn't you?

507
00:58:46,088 --> 00:58:48,022
Hey, man, I saw something, man...

508
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:50,650
but I didn't see it working here, you know what I mean?

509
00:58:50,726 --> 00:58:54,594
Well, they are people just like us...

510
00:58:54,663 --> 00:58:57,257
from within our own solar system...

511
00:58:57,333 --> 00:59:01,133
except that their society is more highly evolved.

512
00:59:01,203 --> 00:59:04,900
They don't have no wars. They got no monetary system.

513
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:09,468
They don't have any leaders because each man is a leader.

514
00:59:09,545 --> 00:59:12,673
I mean, each man... Because of their technology...

515
00:59:12,748 --> 00:59:17,276
they are able to feed, clothe, house and transport themselves...

516
00:59:17,353 --> 00:59:19,480
equally and with no effort.

517
00:59:27,963 --> 00:59:29,294
Wow.

518
00:59:31,033 --> 00:59:32,796
Well, you know something, man?

519
00:59:32,868 --> 00:59:34,995
You wanna know what I think?

520
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:39,404
I think this is a crackpot idea! That's what I think.

521
00:59:39,475 --> 00:59:42,342
How 'bout that? How 'bout a little of that?

522
00:59:42,411 --> 00:59:44,606
I think it's a crackpot idea!

523
00:59:45,981 --> 00:59:47,278
If they're so smart...

524
00:59:47,349 --> 00:59:50,443
why don't they reveal themselves to us and get it over with?

525
00:59:52,054 --> 00:59:56,252
"Why don't they reveal themselves to us?" is because if they did...

526
00:59:56,325 --> 00:59:58,691
it would cause a general panic.

527
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:01,321
Now, we still have leaders...

528
01:00:01,397 --> 01:00:05,265
upon whom we rely for the release of this information.

529
01:00:05,334 --> 01:00:08,497
These leaders have decided...

530
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:12,735
to repress this information because of the tremendous shock...

531
01:00:12,808 --> 01:00:15,800
that it would cause to our antiquated systems.

532
01:00:16,879 --> 01:00:21,816
Now, the result of this has been that the Venusians...

533
01:00:21,884 --> 01:00:26,344
have contacted people at all walks of life.

534
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:28,617
All walks of life.

535
01:00:29,892 --> 01:00:30,950
Yes.

536
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:50,210
It would be a devastatin' blow to our antiquated systems.

537
01:00:50,279 --> 01:00:55,046
So now Venusians are meeting with people in all walks of life...

538
01:00:55,117 --> 01:00:57,142
in an advisory capacity.

539
01:00:57,219 --> 01:01:00,814
For once, man will have a godlike control...

540
01:01:00,889 --> 01:01:03,289
over his own destiny.

541
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:06,988
He will have a chance to transcend and to evolve...

542
01:01:07,062 --> 01:01:09,656
with some equality for all.

543
01:01:17,706 --> 01:01:19,697
How's your joint, George?

544
01:01:25,147 --> 01:01:27,513
Oh, my, I believe it went out.

545
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:31,519
I got to talkin' so much I clean forgot about it.

546
01:01:33,689 --> 01:01:35,088
Went out.

547
01:01:43,532 --> 01:01:46,831
Save it. We'll do it tomorrow morning, first thing, all right?

548
01:01:46,902 --> 01:01:50,235
Gives you a whole new way of looking at the day.

549
01:01:52,441 --> 01:01:54,500
I sure could use that.

550
01:01:56,278 --> 01:01:59,714
Yes, I sure could use a little of that.

551
01:02:10,826 --> 01:02:14,785
<i>Don’t Bogart that joint,</i> <i>my friend</i>

552
01:02:16,432 --> 01:02:19,094
<i>Pass it over to me</i>

553
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:26,267
<i>Don’t Bogart that joint,</i> <i>my friend</i>

554
01:02:27,843 --> 01:02:30,403
<i>Pass it over to me</i>

555
01:02:34,116 --> 01:02:36,209
<i>Roll another one</i>

556
01:02:39,955 --> 01:02:42,480
<i>Just like the other one</i>

557
01:02:45,394 --> 01:02:47,385
<i>You've been hanging on to it</i>

558
01:02:50,232 --> 01:02:53,326
<i>And I sure would like a hit</i>

559
01:03:04,213 --> 01:03:05,441
<i>Yeah</i>

560
01:03:06,882 --> 01:03:08,816
<i>Sing a song, brother</i>

561
01:03:08,884 --> 01:03:13,014
<i>If the sun refused to shine</i>

562
01:03:14,990 --> 01:03:17,458
<i>I don’t mind</i>

563
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:20,261
<i>I don’t mind</i>

564
01:03:22,331 --> 01:03:26,995
<i>If the mountains</i> <i>fell in the sea</i>

565
01:03:28,871 --> 01:03:30,862
<i>Let it be</i>

566
01:03:32,941 --> 01:03:34,909
<i>It ain’t me</i>

567
01:03:37,246 --> 01:03:40,147
<i>Got my own world to live through</i>

568
01:03:40,215 --> 01:03:44,151
<i>And I ain’t gonna copy you</i>

569
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:54,823
<i>Now if a 6 turned out to be 9

570
01:03:56,665 --> 01:03:57,996
<i>Oh, I don’t mind</i>

571
01:04:00,068 --> 01:04:01,797
<i>I don’t mind</i>

572
01:04:03,705 --> 01:04:06,299
<i>If all the hippies</i>

573
01:04:07,209 --> 01:04:09,302
<i>Cut off all their hair</i>

574
01:04:10,979 --> 01:04:12,571
<i>I don’t care</i>

575
01:04:13,949 --> 01:04:15,883
<i>Oh, I don’t care</i>

576
01:04:16,885 --> 01:04:21,913
<i>Dig, 'cause I got my own world</i> <i>to live through and I...</i>

577
01:04:56,525 --> 01:04:59,494
What the hell is this? Troublemakers?

578
01:05:01,029 --> 01:05:04,430
You name it, and I'll throw rocks at it, Sheriff.

579
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:07,298
Y'all, check what just walked in.

580
01:05:08,737 --> 01:05:11,262
Ooh, I like the one in the red shirt with the suspenders.

581
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:13,365
The white shirt's for me.

582
01:05:13,442 --> 01:05:16,104
Look how tuff those black pants are.

583
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:19,238
We're in the establishment now, aren't we, gentlemen?

584
01:05:19,314 --> 01:05:21,805
- What did you say? - I said...

585
01:05:27,589 --> 01:05:30,558
I just can't believe it. What are they doin' here?

586
01:05:30,626 --> 01:05:34,187
- Look at the teeth around his neck. - Did they drive up on motorcycles?

587
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,493
They know we're talkin' about 'em. They're lookin' over here.

588
01:05:38,233 --> 01:05:41,828
Hot damn. I'll tell you.

589
01:05:41,904 --> 01:05:45,362
I'll order kidneys, 'cause I left mine out on the road somewhere.

590
01:05:46,942 --> 01:05:49,206
I don't know, but I like his hair.

591
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:50,802
I like his eyes.

592
01:05:50,879 --> 01:05:53,609
See that little girl right over there in the corner?

593
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:57,142
Don't look too close at her...

594
01:05:57,219 --> 01:06:00,677
because the sheriff's right over there.

595
01:06:00,756 --> 01:06:02,747
Check that one with the long hair.

596
01:06:02,824 --> 01:06:07,352
I checked him. Might have to bring him up to the Hilton before it's over with.

597
01:06:07,429 --> 01:06:09,260
I think she's cute.

598
01:06:09,331 --> 01:06:12,562
Isn't she? Guess we'll put 'em in a woman's cell, don't you reckon?

599
01:06:12,634 --> 01:06:16,798
I think we oughta put 'em in a cage and charge admission to see 'em.

600
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:21,635
Those are what is known as "country witticisms."

601
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:23,974
What are they doin' here?

602
01:06:24,046 --> 01:06:26,378
- I don't know. - I'm gonna ask for a ride.

603
01:06:26,448 --> 01:06:28,507
Don't be foolish. No.

604
01:06:30,118 --> 01:06:32,484
- They'll laugh in your face. - Yeah.

605
01:06:34,456 --> 01:06:36,424
I'm gonna ask 'em.

606
01:06:36,491 --> 01:06:39,085
Not when I'm around you're not gonna ask 'em.

607
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:41,823
- I don't think you're gonna. - Go ahead.

608
01:06:42,931 --> 01:06:44,193
Go ahead.

609
01:06:45,934 --> 01:06:48,926
You know, I thought at first that bunch over there...

610
01:06:49,004 --> 01:06:51,939
their mothers may have been frightened by a bunch of gorillas...

611
01:06:52,007 --> 01:06:54,771
but now I think they're a cult.

612
01:06:54,843 --> 01:06:58,279
One of 'em is Alley Oop, I think, from the beads on him.

613
01:06:58,347 --> 01:07:00,440
One of 'em, darn sure, is not Oola.

614
01:07:00,515 --> 01:07:04,042
Look like a bunch of refugees from a gorilla love-in.

615
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:08,623
- A gorilla couldn't love that. - Nor could a mother.

616
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:12,148
I wouldn't even mate him up with one of those black wenches out there.

617
01:07:13,562 --> 01:07:15,928
Oh, now, I don't know about that.

618
01:07:15,998 --> 01:07:18,796
That's about as low as they come, I'll tell you.

619
01:07:18,867 --> 01:07:21,859
- Oh, he's a biggie. - Man, they're green.

620
01:07:21,937 --> 01:07:23,871
No, they're not green. They're white.

621
01:07:23,939 --> 01:07:24,963
White?

622
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:27,907
You're color-blind. I just got to say that.

623
01:07:27,976 --> 01:07:29,910
I'd like to get some food.

624
01:07:29,978 --> 01:07:32,811
I thought most jails were built for humanity...

625
01:07:32,881 --> 01:07:35,315
and that won't quite qualify.

626
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:37,716
- Wonder where they got those wigs from? - They probably grew 'em.

627
01:07:37,786 --> 01:07:40,084
Look like they're standin' in fertilizer.

628
01:07:40,155 --> 01:07:45,388
- Nothin' else would grow on 'em. - I'm not real hungry at the moment.

629
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:51,459
- You know what I mean? - I saw two of 'em one time.

630
01:07:51,533 --> 01:07:54,093
They were just kissin' away. Two males! Just think of it.

631
01:07:57,673 --> 01:07:59,573
What you think we oughta do with 'em?

632
01:07:59,641 --> 01:08:02,701
I don't know, but I don't think they'll make the parish line.

633
01:08:08,817 --> 01:08:10,284
Let's split.

634
01:08:10,352 --> 01:08:11,683
- Split? - Yeah.

635
01:08:18,326 --> 01:08:21,420
Yes, sir, it certainly has been nice.

636
01:08:28,704 --> 01:08:31,537
They got some fancy bikes out there. That's some Yankee queers.

637
01:08:31,606 --> 01:08:33,597
Check the flag on that bike.

638
01:08:34,876 --> 01:08:37,174
It sure is.

639
01:08:37,245 --> 01:08:39,805
I still say they're not gonna make the parish line.

640
01:08:41,516 --> 01:08:43,507
Here come the poontang.

641
01:08:45,687 --> 01:08:48,212
Hey, y'all, could we have a ride?

642
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:50,656
- You want a ride? - Yeah. Please?

643
01:08:50,726 --> 01:08:53,320
You got a note from your moms?

644
01:08:53,395 --> 01:08:56,660
- My old lady won't mind. - Please let us have a ride.

645
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:01,292
I wouldn't mind giving you a ride.

646
01:09:02,971 --> 01:09:05,030
Uh-oh. The Man is at the window.

647
01:09:05,107 --> 01:09:07,837
The Man is at the window.

648
01:09:07,909 --> 01:09:09,240
Oh, come on.

649
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:11,575
The Man is at the window!

650
01:09:12,714 --> 01:09:14,705
I'd love to take you girls for a ride.

651
01:09:49,317 --> 01:09:53,583
You know, this used to be a hell of a good country.

652
01:09:55,157 --> 01:09:58,092
I can't understand what's gone wrong with it.

653
01:10:02,330 --> 01:10:04,560
Everybody got chicken, that's what happened.

654
01:10:04,633 --> 01:10:07,830
Hey, we can't even get into a second-rate hotel.

655
01:10:07,903 --> 01:10:10,929
I mean, a second-rate motel, you dig?

656
01:10:11,006 --> 01:10:13,133
They think we're gonna cut their throat.

657
01:10:13,208 --> 01:10:17,042
- They're scared, man. - They're not scared of you.

658
01:10:17,112 --> 01:10:20,309
They're scared of what you represent to 'em.

659
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:25,285
Hey, man, all we represent to them is somebody who needs a haircut.

660
01:10:25,353 --> 01:10:26,479
Oh, no.

661
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:30,548
What you represent to them is freedom.

662
01:10:30,625 --> 01:10:33,116
What's wrong with freedom? That's what it's all about.

663
01:10:33,195 --> 01:10:36,096
That's right. That's what it's all about.

664
01:10:36,164 --> 01:10:38,632
But talkin' about it and bein' it...

665
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:40,930
that's two different things.

666
01:10:42,003 --> 01:10:43,994
It's real hard to be free...

667
01:10:44,072 --> 01:10:47,098
when you are bought and sold in the marketplace.

668
01:10:49,945 --> 01:10:52,641
'Course, don't ever tell anybody that they're not free...

669
01:10:52,714 --> 01:10:55,512
'cause then they gonna get real busy killin' and maimin'...

670
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:58,280
to prove to you that they are.

671
01:10:58,353 --> 01:11:02,084
Oh, yeah, they gonna talk to you and talk to you and talk to you...

672
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:04,523
about individual freedom.

673
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:08,620
But they see a free individual, it's gonna scare 'em.

674
01:11:10,165 --> 01:11:12,190
Well, it don't make 'em runnin' scared.

675
01:11:13,869 --> 01:11:16,838
No. It makes 'em dangerous.

676
01:11:27,382 --> 01:11:28,713
Swamp.

677
01:11:31,987 --> 01:11:33,352
Yeah, right, man.

678
01:11:36,591 --> 01:11:38,525
- Swamp. - Swamp!

679
01:11:44,933 --> 01:11:46,560
You ever...

680
01:11:47,903 --> 01:11:51,896
You ever talk to bullfrogs in the middle of the night?

681
01:11:51,973 --> 01:11:53,406
Not generally.

682
01:11:56,077 --> 01:11:58,136
You know what I used to do?

683
01:11:59,614 --> 01:12:01,639
What did you used to do?

684
01:12:01,716 --> 01:12:04,150
I'll tell you one thing I didn't used to do...

685
01:12:04,219 --> 01:12:07,188
is talk to bullfrogs in the middle of the night, fool.

686
01:12:07,255 --> 01:12:09,689
Shit! You're out of your mind!

687
01:12:09,758 --> 01:12:11,123
That's right.

688
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:23,061
Hey, man.

689
01:13:26,067 --> 01:13:27,398
You okay?

690
01:13:47,922 --> 01:13:50,857
Oh, God, man. Oh, God.

691
01:13:56,531 --> 01:13:59,364
What are we gonna do with his stuff, man?

692
01:14:01,803 --> 01:14:03,794
Get it to his folks.

693
01:14:09,644 --> 01:14:11,635
There's not much here.

694
01:14:11,713 --> 01:14:14,841
There's some money and his driver's license.

695
01:14:14,916 --> 01:14:18,511
There's a... Oh, man, here's his card, man.

696
01:14:20,655 --> 01:14:22,714
He ain't gonna be using that.

697
01:14:53,855 --> 01:14:56,517
We'll go there for one drink. Just one drink.

698
01:15:18,113 --> 01:15:21,549
No, man. Hey, listen. Seriously. He would have wanted us to.

699
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:26,510
"If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him."

700
01:16:28,950 --> 01:16:31,009
That's a humdinger.

701
01:16:35,890 --> 01:16:40,156
I'm getting a little smashed, man. A little smashed.

702
01:16:57,745 --> 01:16:59,736
Wow, it's hot in here, man.

703
01:17:05,453 --> 01:17:06,920
Chicks, man.

704
01:17:11,259 --> 01:17:13,489
Where are those chicks, man?

705
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,917
Look at this one.

706
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:43,253
- It's okay. - Good-bye, girls.

707
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:48,788
- Howdy. - Hello.

708
01:17:48,863 --> 01:17:50,797
My name is Billy...

709
01:17:50,865 --> 01:17:53,459
and this here is Captain America.

710
01:17:53,534 --> 01:17:55,229
Excuse me one minute, ladies.

711
01:17:55,303 --> 01:17:57,794
Do you mind if I take the tall one, man?

712
01:17:57,872 --> 01:18:00,363
- No, that's all right. - Oh, thank you, man.

713
01:18:06,347 --> 01:18:09,783
Come on, you little hoofer, you. Get yourself over here.

714
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:15,286
You ol' thing, you. I'm really from New York.

715
01:18:15,356 --> 01:18:18,325
This is all just a weird act.

716
01:18:18,393 --> 01:18:21,157
You're a freak, aren't you?

717
01:18:22,664 --> 01:18:23,995
My name is Mary.

718
01:18:31,673 --> 01:18:34,107
- You want a drink, Mary? - No, thanks.

719
01:18:34,175 --> 01:18:36,166
What's this?

720
01:18:36,244 --> 01:18:38,940
- Is this really your hair? - What is this?

721
01:18:39,013 --> 01:18:41,743
Is this really your hair? Are you kidding me?

722
01:18:41,816 --> 01:18:45,650
- What are these things? - Well, what are these things?

723
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:47,654
I'm kind of a freak myself.

724
01:18:48,856 --> 01:18:51,791
I never really thought of myself as a freak...

725
01:18:51,859 --> 01:18:53,850
but I love to freak.

726
01:18:55,830 --> 01:18:59,288
- What's happening outside? - What?

727
01:19:00,535 --> 01:19:03,470
In the street. What's happening? Mardi Gras.

728
01:19:03,538 --> 01:19:05,972
Oh, well, it's crowded and all that.

729
01:19:11,112 --> 01:19:12,204
Yeah.

730
01:19:14,148 --> 01:19:15,638
Want a drink?

731
01:19:21,823 --> 01:19:23,882
- Here's to you. - Thank you.

732
01:19:29,564 --> 01:19:32,431
What's the matter? Don't you like me?

733
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:35,367
- What? - You paid for me, right?

734
01:19:37,672 --> 01:19:40,698
Well, that was for my friend.

735
01:19:42,610 --> 01:19:44,510
I don't...

736
01:19:45,446 --> 01:19:48,381
- Why don't I buy you a drink. - I don't drink.

737
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:01,685
I've got an idea. Let's go outside.

738
01:20:11,105 --> 01:20:13,039
We'll all go outside to Mardi Gras.

739
01:20:14,409 --> 01:20:15,876
Okay?

740
01:20:22,583 --> 01:20:27,350
<i>When the saints go marching in</i>

741
01:20:27,422 --> 01:20:31,620
<i>When the saints</i> <i>go marching in</i>

742
01:20:33,394 --> 01:20:38,127
<i>You know I want to be</i> <i>in that number</i>

743
01:20:39,634 --> 01:20:42,762
<i>When the saints go marching in</i>

744
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:10,825
<i>Now when the saints</i> <i>go marching in</i>

745
01:21:10,898 --> 01:21:15,130
<i>Oh, when the saints</i> <i>go marching in</i>

746
01:21:16,904 --> 01:21:22,171
<i>I want to be in that number</i>

747
01:21:22,243 --> 01:21:25,679
<i>When the saints go marching in</i>

748
01:22:08,322 --> 01:22:13,055
<i>Oh, when the saints</i> <i>go marching on in</i>

749
01:22:13,127 --> 01:22:16,824
<i>Oh, when the saints</i> <i>go marching in</i>

750
01:22:18,132 --> 01:22:23,229
<i>You know I want to be</i> <i>in thaf number</i>

751
01:22:23,304 --> 01:22:26,865
<i>When the saints go marching in</i>

752
01:23:14,555 --> 01:23:15,886
What's that?

753
01:23:17,024 --> 01:23:18,355
What's that?

754
01:23:20,828 --> 01:23:23,296
Never mind. Just shut up and take it.

755
01:23:23,364 --> 01:23:24,888
Yeah, right.

756
01:23:31,672 --> 01:23:33,663
What do you do with it?

757
01:23:36,043 --> 01:23:39,012
- Give it to me. - Just shut up and take it, man.

758
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:41,071
Put it under your tongue.

759
01:23:56,597 --> 01:23:58,224
I believe in God...

760
01:24:00,768 --> 01:24:02,531
the Father Almighty...

761
01:24:03,504 --> 01:24:05,495
Creator of heaven and earth...

762
01:24:09,076 --> 01:24:13,376
Going up for the last time. The last time. The last time.

763
01:24:15,783 --> 01:24:18,843
...was crucified, died and was buried.

764
01:24:18,919 --> 01:24:23,049
He descended into hell. The third day, He arose again from the dead.

765
01:24:23,124 --> 01:24:26,150
He ascended into heaven and sitteth at the right hand of God...

766
01:24:26,227 --> 01:24:29,128
the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.

767
01:24:29,196 --> 01:24:33,530
I believe in God, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth...

768
01:24:33,601 --> 01:24:36,570
and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord.

769
01:24:36,637 --> 01:24:37,763
Shut up.

770
01:24:37,838 --> 01:24:41,001
Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary...

771
01:24:41,075 --> 01:24:44,602
suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried.

772
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:48,911
He descended into hell. The third day, He arose again from the dead.

773
01:24:48,983 --> 01:24:50,507
He ascended into heaven...

774
01:24:50,584 --> 01:24:53,917
and sitteth at the right hand of God, the Father Almighty.

775
01:24:53,988 --> 01:24:56,684
From thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.

776
01:24:56,757 --> 01:25:00,488
I believe in the Holy Ghost, the holy Catholic Church...

777
01:25:00,561 --> 01:25:03,155
the Communion of Saints, the Forgiveness of sins...

778
01:25:03,230 --> 01:25:06,199
the Resurrection of the body and Life everlasting.

779
01:25:06,267 --> 01:25:07,427
Amen.

780
01:25:07,501 --> 01:25:09,366
Glory be to the Father and to the Son...

781
01:25:09,437 --> 01:25:12,099
- and to the Holy Ghost... - How could you make me hate you so much?

782
01:25:12,173 --> 01:25:15,870
As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be...

783
01:25:15,943 --> 01:25:17,877
- I hate you so much. - World without end. Amen.

784
01:25:17,945 --> 01:25:19,879
- Look at me. - I want you to be beautiful.

785
01:25:19,947 --> 01:25:21,539
I always wanted to be pretty.

786
01:25:21,615 --> 01:25:24,209
Listen to me. I want you to be beautiful.

787
01:25:24,285 --> 01:25:27,413
- I want you to be beautiful. - No.

788
01:25:27,488 --> 01:25:29,649
You know me.

789
01:25:29,724 --> 01:25:32,352
I know you.

790
01:25:32,426 --> 01:25:37,193
- Baby... - You did something bad.

791
01:25:38,733 --> 01:25:41,463
I know you.

792
01:25:41,535 --> 01:25:45,369
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.

793
01:25:45,439 --> 01:25:49,000
Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

794
01:25:50,411 --> 01:25:53,073
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners...

795
01:25:53,147 --> 01:25:56,082
- now and at the hour of... - I know it. I know you.

796
01:25:56,150 --> 01:25:58,345
I know you. I know you.

797
01:25:59,153 --> 01:26:00,518
Oh, wow.

798
01:26:03,290 --> 01:26:05,724
Glory be to the Father and to the Son...

799
01:26:05,793 --> 01:26:09,024
We're all aglow, man! Look at this! We're all aglow!

800
01:26:09,096 --> 01:26:11,826
Glow! Glow! We're all aglow!

801
01:26:11,899 --> 01:26:13,833
Where's your junk?

802
01:26:16,604 --> 01:26:18,868
- I don't know if I like you. - I like you.

803
01:26:20,307 --> 01:26:22,104
But I like you.

804
01:26:25,112 --> 01:26:28,275
Don't you dare. Don't you dare!

805
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:31,241
I can feel the outside.

806
01:26:31,318 --> 01:26:33,309
I can feel the outside, but I can't...

807
01:26:34,221 --> 01:26:37,247
I can't feel the inside.

808
01:26:37,324 --> 01:26:38,586
Okay?

809
01:26:38,659 --> 01:26:40,217
Don't stop!

810
01:26:40,294 --> 01:26:43,525
I'm dying! I'm gonna die!

811
01:26:43,597 --> 01:26:45,758
I'm gonna die!

812
01:26:45,833 --> 01:26:50,429
I'm dead. I'm dead. Do you understand?

813
01:26:50,504 --> 01:26:54,201
Mary love the lamb...

814
01:26:54,275 --> 01:26:57,176
Mary love the...

815
01:26:58,345 --> 01:27:00,745
Oh, dear God! Please help me!

816
01:27:00,815 --> 01:27:04,216
Please help me to conceive a child!

817
01:27:04,285 --> 01:27:05,912
I'm right out here.

818
01:27:08,055 --> 01:27:10,546
I'm right out here! I'm right out here.

819
01:27:11,458 --> 01:27:13,756
I'm out here, out of my head.

820
01:27:16,030 --> 01:27:20,490
Please, God, let me out of here!

821
01:27:22,636 --> 01:27:25,571
I want to get out of here!

822
01:27:27,408 --> 01:27:29,467
Please help me.

823
01:27:29,543 --> 01:27:31,568
Do you know what I mean?

824
01:27:31,645 --> 01:27:35,479
You wanted me ugly, didn't you? I know you johns.

825
01:27:35,549 --> 01:27:39,417
In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

826
01:27:39,486 --> 01:27:42,353
- You never thought about me. - I believe in God, the Father Almighty...

827
01:27:42,423 --> 01:27:44,186
Why did you leave like that?

828
01:27:44,258 --> 01:27:48,319
- Everybody else, but not you. - He descended into hell.

829
01:27:48,395 --> 01:27:50,329
- And not me. - The third day, He arose again...

830
01:27:50,397 --> 01:27:51,591
...hallowed be Thy name.

831
01:27:51,665 --> 01:27:54,099
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done...

832
01:27:54,168 --> 01:27:56,568
on earth as it is in heaven.

833
01:27:56,637 --> 01:28:00,698
Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses...

834
01:28:00,774 --> 01:28:01,968
as we forgive...

835
01:28:02,042 --> 01:28:05,637
You're such a fool, mother, and I hate you so much.

836
01:29:03,304 --> 01:29:05,295
We've done it. We've done it.

837
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:08,174
We're rich, Wyatt.

838
01:29:09,810 --> 01:29:11,334
Yeah, man.

839
01:29:15,316 --> 01:29:19,184
We did it, man. We did it. We did it.

840
01:29:22,089 --> 01:29:23,522
We're rich, man.

841
01:29:24,425 --> 01:29:26,416
We're retired in Florida now, mister.

842
01:29:29,430 --> 01:29:30,920
You know, Billy...

843
01:29:33,067 --> 01:29:34,557
we blew it.

844
01:29:35,903 --> 01:29:37,234
What?

845
01:29:38,939 --> 01:29:41,407
That's what it's all about. I mean, like, you know.

846
01:29:41,475 --> 01:29:44,638
You go for the big money, man, and then you're free.

847
01:29:44,712 --> 01:29:46,043
You dig?

848
01:29:50,417 --> 01:29:52,078
We blew it.

849
01:29:59,193 --> 01:30:01,127
Good night, man.

850
01:30:33,127 --> 01:30:36,688
<i>Darkness at the break of noon</i> <i>Shadows even the silver spoon</i>

<i>The handmade blade, the child's balloon</i> <i>Eclipses both the sun and moon</i>

852
01:30:40,934 --> 01:30:44,301
<i>To understand you know too soon</i> <i>There is no sense in tryin'</i>

853
01:30:53,547 --> 01:30:56,846
<i>Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn</i> <i>Suicide remarks are torn</i>

854

<i>Temptation's page flies out the door</i> <i>You follow, find yourself at war</i>

858

860
01:31:31,452 --> 01:31:33,420
<i>So don't fear</i>

861
01:31:33,487 --> 01:31:35,614
<i>When you hear</i>

862
01:31:35,689 --> 01:31:38,624
<i>A foreign sound to your ear</i>

863
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:42,224
<i>It's all right, Ma</i>

864
01:31:42,296 --> 01:31:44,355
<i>I'm only sighin'</i>

865
01:32:04,151 --> 01:32:05,778
Hey, Arnold, look at them two.

866
01:32:05,853 --> 01:32:08,287
Pull alongside. We'll scare the hell out of 'em.

867
01:32:16,463 --> 01:32:18,897
Want me to blow your brains out?

868
01:32:24,171 --> 01:32:26,105
Why don't you get a haircut?

869
01:32:30,644 --> 01:32:31,941
What happened?

870
01:32:45,259 --> 01:32:46,624
Billy!

871
01:32:48,862 --> 01:32:50,830
Oh, my God.

872
01:32:50,898 --> 01:32:54,265
- I'm going for help. - I'm gonna get 'em.

873
01:32:54,334 --> 01:32:55,824
We better go back.

874
01:33:01,909 --> 01:33:03,342
I'm gonna get 'em.

875
01:33:05,879 --> 01:33:07,471
We're ready now.
